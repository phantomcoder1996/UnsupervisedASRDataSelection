WE SHALL TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN THE SILKWORMS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT OUR MULBERRY LEAVES WILL BE SOLD WE SHALL KNOW THE STRANGE VICISSITUDES OF LIFE IN PROVENCE AND THE STORMS THAT MAY ATTACK EVEN A PEACEFUL HOUSEHOLD
WHAT GRATITUDE COULD YOU FEEL TO ME LATER FOR A GIFT IN WHICH MY GOODWILL COUNTED FOR NOTHING IF DURING THE TIME THAT I REMAINED INDIFFERENT TO YOU YIELDING ONLY A PASSIVE OBEDIENCE SUCH AS MY MOTHER HAS JUST BEEN URGING ON ME A CHILD WERE BORN TO US
AND INVEST HER WITH AN EXHAUSTLESS POWER A REDUNDANCY OF LIFE THAT MAKES EVERYTHING BLOSSOM AROUND HER THE MORE SHE IS MISTRESS OF HERSELF THE MORE CERTAINLY WILL THE LOVE AND HAPPINESS SHE CREATES BE FIT TO WEATHER THE STORMS OF LIFE
WHOSE WORDS THRILLED ME AND ON WHOSE ARM I LEANT WITH PLEASURE BEYOND WORDS IN SHORT TO BE OPEN WITH YOU AS I WOULD BE WITH GOD BEFORE WHOM CONCEALMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE THE PERFECT LOYALTY WITH WHICH HE HAD KEPT HIS OATH MAY HAVE PIQUED ME
ACT OR THINK WITHOUT ADDING TO THE ADMIRATION I FEEL FOR YOUR CHARM BOTH OF BODY AND MIND THERE IS IN YOU A RARE COMBINATION OF THE IDEAL THE PRACTICAL AND THE BEWITCHING WHICH SATISFIES ALIKE JUDGMENT A HUSBAND'S PRIDE DESIRE AND HOPE
YET LOUIS IS LOVABLE HIS TEMPER IS WONDERFULLY EVEN AND HE PERFORMS AS A MATTER OF COURSE ACTS ON WHICH MOST MEN WOULD PLUME THEMSELVES IN SHORT IF I DO NOT LOVE HIM I SHALL FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN BEING GOOD TO HIM
I LONG FOR THE DAY WHICH SHALL MAKE YOU A MOTHER THAT I MAY SEE YOU CONTENT WITH THE FULNESS OF YOUR LIFE MAY HEAR YOU IN THE SWEET VOICE I LOVE AND WITH THE THOUGHTS BLESS THE LOVE WHICH HAS REFRESHED MY SOUL AND GIVEN NEW VIGOR TO MY POWERS
I FOUND MY ROOM ALMOST EXACTLY AS I LEFT IT
MARRIAGE SOON BECOMES INTOLERABLE UNLESS THE WOMAN IS THE PRESIDING SPIRIT A WOMAN IN SUCH A CASE NEEDS THE CHARM OF A MISTRESS COMBINED WITH THE SOLID QUALITIES OF A WIFE
SECURE OF MY FREEDOM I WAS ABLE TO THROW MYSELF GAILY INTO THE PETTY DETAILS WHICH ALWAYS ACCOMPANY A CEREMONY OF THE KIND AND TO BE MY NATURAL SELF PERHAPS I MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR AN OLD BIRD AS THEY SAY AT BLOIS
WHEN YOU ARE MARRIED YOU WILL APPROVE THIS RESERVE ENOUGH THAT NOTHING WAS LACKING EITHER OF SATISFACTION FOR THE MOST FASTIDIOUS SENTIMENT OR OF THAT UNEXPECTEDNESS WHICH BRINGS IN A SENSE ITS OWN SANCTION
WHY NOT SEEK FOR HAPPINESS I SAID TO MYSELF MOREOVER I AM LOVED AND THE LOVE OFFERED ME I SHALL ACCEPT MY MARRIED LIFE WILL BE NO SLAVERY BUT RATHER A PERPETUAL REIGN
LEAVE ME ABSOLUTELY FREE I WOULD PUT NO HINDRANCE IN THE WAY OF YOUR INSPIRING ME WITH A LOVE SIMILAR TO YOUR OWN BUT I AM DETERMINED TO BE YOURS ONLY OF MY OWN FREE GIFT CREATE IN ME THE WISH TO GIVE UP MY FREEDOM
A CODE WHICH WILL DRIVE AS MANY GIRLS OF GOOD FAMILY INTO CONVENTS AS IT WILL FIND HUSBANDS FOR THE FRENCH NOBILITY FROM THE LITTLE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER SEEM TO BE DIVIDED ON THESE MATTERS THE DINNER DARLING
SUCH IS YOUR FRIEND'S SPLENDID TITLE
PERHAPS SOME DAY THE COUNTRY DAME MAY GO AND SPEND A WINTER IN MARSEILLES BUT DANGER DOES NOT HAUNT THE PURLIEUS OF A NARROW PROVINCIAL STAGE THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO FEAR NOT EVEN AN ADMIRATION SUCH AS COULD ONLY MAKE A WOMAN PROUD
THAT MY DESTINED HUSBAND WAS SLOWLY TRAVELING ON FOOT THROUGH RUSSIA POLAND AND GERMANY HIS BAD LUCK ONLY FORSOOK HIM AT BERLIN WHERE THE FRENCH MINISTER HELPED HIS RETURN TO HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
LIFE GIVES US BUT ONE FRIEND AND I WISH TO BE YOURS FRIENDSHIP IS THE BOND BETWEEN A PAIR OF KINDRED SOULS UNITED IN THEIR STRENGTH AND YET INDEPENDENT LET US BE FRIENDS AND COMRADES TO BEAR JOINTLY THE BURDEN OF LIFE
I DREW HIM ASIDE IN THE MOST NATURAL MANNER ON SOLITARY WALKS DURING WHICH I DISCREETLY SOUNDED HIS FEELINGS I MADE HIM TALK AND GOT HIM TO EXPOUND TO ME HIS IDEAS AND PLANS FOR OUR FUTURE MY QUESTIONS BETRAYED SO MANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
BITTERLY ASHAMED I STRUGGLED WITH MYSELF ALAS WHEN PRIDE IS THE ONLY MOTIVE FOR RESISTANCE EXCUSES FOR CAPITULATION ARE SOON FOUND WE CELEBRATED OUR UNION IN SECRET AND SECRET IT MUST REMAIN BETWEEN US
WOULD BE DULY ACKNOWLEDGED AS HERS IN THE CONTRACT IN A SIMILAR WAY MY YOUNGER BROTHER JEAN DE MAUCOMBE AS SOON AS HE CAME OF AGE SIGNED A DOCUMENT STATING THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM HIS PARENTS
A LOOK OF YOUTH THE GREATER REFINEMENT WHICH I INTRODUCED INTO THE HOUSE WAS REFLECTED IN HIS PERSON INSENSIBLY I BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO HIS PRESENCE AND MADE ANOTHER SELF OF HIM
I CAN'T TELL YOU ALL MY REASONS FOR THIS TO YOU ALONE SHALL I CONFIDE EVEN AS MUCH AS THIS I BELIEVE THAT WOMEN WHETHER PASSIONATELY LOVED OR NOT LOSE MUCH IN THEIR RELATION WITH THEIR HUSBANDS BY NOT CONCEALING THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT MARRIAGE AND THE WAY THEY LOOK AT IT
TO BE THE UNCEASING SPRING OF HAPPINESS FOR A MAN WHO KNOWS IT AND ADDS GRATITUDE TO LOVE AH DEAR ONE THIS IS A CONVICTION WHICH FORTIFIES THE SOUL EVEN MORE THAN THE MOST PASSIONATE LOVE CAN DO
IN THE CASTLE OF MAUCOMBE
AND THAT I WAS VERY WELL PLEASED HIS FATHER SHOULD CONTINUE TO LOOK AFTER THE ESTATE AND PRACTISE ECONOMIES BECAUSE I WISHED HIM TO DEVOTE HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO POLITICS IF WE HAD CHILDREN I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM ALL PROSPEROUS AND WITH GOOD STATE APPOINTMENTS
IN THE NEXT PLACE HE SHARES OUR VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT OF MY BEAUTY AND IT IS CRUEL FOR HIM TO SEE HOW THE HARDSHIPS OF HIS LIFE HAVE ROBBED HIM OF YOUTH FINALLY HE FELT THE SUPERIORITY OF MY WOMANHOOD OVER HIS MANHOOD
YOU ARE SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL RENEE AND YOUR BEAUTY IS OF THE STATUESQUE AND REGAL TYPE ON WHICH TIME LEAVES BUT LITTLE IMPRESSION NO DOUBT THE LOVE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE DEPENDS LESS ON OUTWARD BEAUTY THAN ON GRACES OF CHARACTER
AFTER SUCCESSFULLY ELUDING THE CONSCRIPTION HE WAS FORCED TO SEND HIM TO THE ARMY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN TO JOIN THE EMPEROR'S BODYGUARD AFTER LEIPSIC NO MORE WAS HEARD OF HIM
OUR OWN IMPULSE SHALL WITH US ALONE DICTATE THE EXPRESSION OF FEELING WE SHALL BE FREE EVEN IN OUR FETTERS I SHALL HAVE THE MORE PRIDE IN WOOING YOU AGAIN NOW THAT I KNOW THE REWARD YOU PLACE ON VICTORY YOU CANNOT SPEAK BREATHE
YOUR FAVORS TO ME HOWEVER SLIGHT WILL ALWAYS MAKE MY HAPPINESS IN THE FAR DISTANT FUTURE AS NOW FOR I AM SENSIBLE HOW MUCH DIGNITY THERE IS IN OUR PROMISE TO RESPECT EACH OTHER'S LIBERTY
WHICH WAS SERVED TO US ON OLD SILVER DISHES BLACKENED AND BATTERED THE EXILE MY DARLING PET IS LIKE THE RAILING EMACIATED HE IS PALE AND SILENT AND BEARS TRACES OF SUFFERING AT THIRTY SEVEN HE MIGHT BE FIFTY
AND BEFORE LONG IT BECAME CLEAR THAT CHANCE HAD GIVEN ME FOR ADVERSARY ONE WHO WAS THE LESS FITTED FOR THE CONTEST BECAUSE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF WHAT YOU MAGNILOQUENTLY CALL MY GREATNESS OF SOUL BROKEN BY SUFFERINGS AND MISFORTUNE
BY DINT OF CONSTANT WATCHING I DISCOVERED HOW HIS MIND AND COUNTENANCE HARMONIZE THE ANIMAL THAT WE CALL A HUSBAND TO QUOTE YOUR WORDS DISAPPEARED AND ONE BALMY EVENING I DISCOVERED IN HIS STEAD A LOVER
WHICH ARE YOURS ALSO IN PERFECTION STILL LET ME SAY THAT THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING YOUR UNCHANGING BEAUTY ON WHICH TO FEAST MY EYES GIVES ME A JOY THAT GROWS WITH EVERY GLANCE THERE IS A GRACE AND DIGNITY IN THE LINES OF YOUR FACE
A YEAR HENCE HIS STYLE WILL HAVE STILL FURTHER IMPROVED LOUIS IS NOW IN HIS FIRST TRANSPORT WHAT I LOOK FORWARD TO IS THE UNIFORM AND CONTINUOUS SENSATION OF CONTENT WHICH OUGHT TO BE THE FRUIT OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE
WITH THE ADDITION OF THE FATHER'S SAVINGS
AND TRY TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT THE SERIOUS NATURE OF WHAT I WAS UNDERTAKING FILLED ME AT FIRST WITH TERROR MARRIAGE IS A MATTER CONCERNING THE WHOLE OF LIFE WHILST LOVE AIMS ONLY AT PLEASURE
LA CRAMPADE FEBRUARY MY DEAR LOUISE I WAS BOUND TO WAIT SOME TIME BEFORE WRITING TO YOU BUT NOW I KNOW OR RATHER I HAVE LEARNED MANY THINGS WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FUTURE HAPPINESS I MUST TELL YOU
AND TO QUEEN IT IN PARIS YOUR POOR LITTLE SWEETHEART RENEE THAT CHILD OF THE DESERT HAS FALLEN FROM THE EMPYREAN WHITHER TOGETHER WE HAD SOARED INTO THE VULGAR REALITIES OF A LIFE AS HOMELY AS A DAISY'S
EVERY WITCHERY OF IMAGINATION OF PASSION OF RELUCTANCE OVERCOME OF THE IDEAL PASSING INTO REALITY PLAYED ITS PART YET IN SPITE OF ALL THIS ENCHANTMENT I ONCE MORE STOOD OUT FOR MY COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE
THE FAVOR I AM ABOUT TO ASK FROM YOU WILL DEMAND UNSELFISHNESS ON YOUR PART FAR NOBLER THAN THE SERVITUDE TO WHICH A MAN'S LOVE WHEN SINCERE IS SUPPOSED TO REDUCE HIM THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU RISE TO THE HEIGHT OF FRIENDSHIP SUCH AS I UNDERSTAND IT
THIS DIFFICULTY THE FIRST WHICH HAS ARISEN IS THE ONLY ONE WHICH HAS DELAYED THE COMPLETION OF OUR MARRIAGE ALTHOUGH AT FIRST I MAY HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO ACCEPT ANYTHING RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE CONVENT IT IS ONLY IN HUMAN NATURE
MY HAPPINESS WOULD WOUND HIM AND HAS TO BE CONCEALED HE IS SENSITIVE AS A WOMAN LIKE ALL MEN WHO HAVE SUFFERED MUCH FOR THREE MONTHS WE REMAINED AS WE WERE BEFORE MARRIAGE AS YOU MAY IMAGINE
A PROVENCAL LAD AND THE OLD WOMAN WHO USED TO WAIT ON HIS WIFE THE ROOMS ARE SCANTILY FURNISHED NEVERTHELESS THE HOUSE OF L'ESTORADE HAD DONE ITS BEST THE CUPBOARDS HAD BEEN RANSACKED AND ITS LAST MAN BEATEN UP FOR THE DINNER
AT LAST IT DAWNED UPON ME THAT THE UNEXPECTED RETURN OF THIS SON WAS THE CAUSE OF MY OWN WHO COULD HAVE IMAGINED WHILST FANCY WAS LEADING US A GIDDY DANCE
OH OUR DEFERENCE AND PROPRIETY ARE QUITE DISQUIETING I ASSURE YOU THERE I AM OFF AGAIN GOOD BYE DEAR P S I HAVE JUST OPENED YOUR THIRD LETTER
ONLY A SIMPLE COUNTRY HOUSE STANDING BENEATH ONE OF OUR HILLS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THAT NOBLE VALLEY THE PRIDE OF WHICH IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE CASTLE OF MAUCOMBE THE BUILDING IS QUITE UNPRETENTIOUS FOUR PEBBLE WALLS COVERED WITH A YELLOWISH WASH
MY FATHER AND MOTHER ENTERED INTO THEIR NEIGHBOR'S IDEA WITH AN EYE TO MY INTERESTS SO SOON AS THEY DISCOVERED THAT RENEE DE MAUCOMBE WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE WITHOUT A DOWRY AND THAT THE MONEY THE SAID RENEE OUGHT TO INHERIT FROM HER PARENTS
A FRIENDSHIP WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF THESE ADVANTAGES WOULD SHUT ITS EYES TO MANY OF THE IMPERFECTIONS OF HUMANITY NOW THERE WAS NO OBSTACLE TO THE EXISTENCE OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MYSELF AND LOUIS DE L'ESTORADE
WE SAT FIVE IN THE ANTIQUATED CARRIAGE AND ARRIVED IN STATE ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK THE DINNER WAS FOR THREE AT THE GRANGE WHICH IS THE DWELLING OF THE BARON DE L'ESTORADE MY FATHER IN LAW TO BE HAS YOU SEE NO CASTLE
HAVING GOT AN INCH TO ASK FOR AN ELL AND YOU AND I SWEET LOVE ARE OF THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE IT ALL I WATCHED LOUIS OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE AND PUT IT TO MYSELF HAS SUFFERING HAD A SOFTENING OR A HARDENING EFFECT ON HIM
EVEN THE OLD MAN WOULD NOT BE A BLOT UPON MY PRETTY HOME AND HAS BROUGHT HIMSELF INTO LINE WITH ALL MY IMPROVEMENTS TO PLEASE ME HE HAS ADOPTED THE DRESS AND WITH THE DRESS THE MANNERS OF THE DAY WE HAVE ENGLISH HORSES
NOT COUNTING HOUSE AND LANDS QUITE A CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE IN PROVENCE HIS WORTHY FATHER HAD BOUGHT ON THE VERY EVE OF THE CHEVALIER'S RETURN A FINE BUT BADLY MANAGED ESTATE WHERE HE DESIGNS TO PLANT TEN THOUSAND MULBERRY TREES
SHALL BE ALWAYS GREEN I SHALL CARRY MY PARK UP THE HILLSIDE AND PLANT ON THE HIGHEST POINT SOME PRETTY KIOSQUE WHENCE PERHAPS MY EYES MAY CATCH THE SHIMMER OF THE MEDITERRANEAN ORANGE AND LEMON TREES AND ALL CHOICEST THINGS THAT GROW
ONE EVENING HE TENTATIVELY SUGGESTED THAT I ONLY MARRIED HIM TO ESCAPE THE CONVENT I CANNOT DENY IT WAS MY GRAVE REPLY MY DEAR IT TOUCHED ME TO THE HEART TO SEE THE TWO GREAT TEARS WHICH STOOD IN HIS EYES
I HAVE VOWED TO MYSELF TO COMFORT THIS YOUNG MAN WHO HAS NEVER KNOWN YOUTH BUT PASSED STRAIGHT FROM HIS MOTHER'S ARMS TO THE EMBRACE OF WAR AND FROM THE JOYS OF HIS COUNTRY HOME TO THE FROSTS AND FORCED LABOR OF SIBERIA
AND OBTAINING FOR IT THE MAXIMUM OF PLEASURE WITH THE MINIMUM OF COST I HAVE ALREADY CONVINCED LOUIS OF THE NECESSITY OF GETTING ROADS MADE IN ORDER THAT HE MAY EARN THE REPUTATION OF A MAN INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF HIS DISTRICT
WHICH MY CHILDISH EYES USED TO SEE WITHOUT COMPREHENDING A FORTNIGHT AFTER MY ARRIVAL MY FATHER AND MOTHER TOOK ME ALONG WITH MY TWO BROTHERS TO DINE WITH ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS
WHEN I AM WITH YOU LOVE SO TRANSPORTS ME THAT I AM POWERLESS TO EXPRESS THE DEPTH OF MY AFFECTION I CAN BUT WORSHIP AND ADMIRE ONLY AT A DISTANCE DOES THE POWER OF SPEECH RETURN
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GIRL AND A MARRIED WOMAN IS SO VAST THAT THE GIRL CAN NO MORE COMPREHEND IT THAN THE MARRIED WOMAN CAN GO BACK TO GIRLHOOD AGAIN
AND MY CHILDREN IF I HAVE ANY WILL NOT BE RENT FROM ME THEY WILL BE MINE TO TRAIN AND MAKE MEN OF THE JOY OF MY LIFE IF YOU ALSO ARE TRUE TO YOUR DESTINY
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THESE THREE OBVIOUS DRAWBACKS MADE HIM DISTRUSTFUL OF HIMSELF HE DOUBTED HIS POWER TO MAKE ME HAPPY AND GUESSED THAT HE HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS
HUMBLE COUNTRY PLEASURES WILL ENLIVEN THE MONOTONY OF MY FUTURE IT SHALL BE MY AMBITION TO ENLARGE THE OASIS ROUND MY HOUSE AND TO GIVE IT THE LORDLY SHADE OF FINE TREES
WITH MAGIC TOUCH I HAVE EFFACED THE VERY MEMORY OF HIS SUFFERINGS IT IS A COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS LOUIS IS REALLY VERY ATTRACTIVE NOW FEELING SURE OF MY AFFECTION HE THROWS OFF HIS RESERVE AND DISPLAYS UNSUSPECTED GIFTS
THAT LOUIS HAS SINCE CONFESSED TO ME THE ALARM IT CAUSED HIM TO FIND IN ME SO LITTLE OF THE IGNORANT MAIDEN THEN I LISTENED TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN REPLY HE GOT MIXED UP IN HIS ARGUMENTS AS PEOPLE DO WHEN HANDICAPPED BY FEAR
THAT HE WILL LEAVE THE REINS IN HIS WIFE'S HANDS AND AS I SHALL DO NOTHING TO REMIND HIM OF THIS WISE RESOLVE IT IS LIKELY HE MAY PERSEVERE IN IT YOU MY DEAR LOUISE WILL SUPPLY THE ROMANCE OF MY LIFE
HAVING RENOUNCED ALL IDEA OF FINDING IN MARRIAGE THOSE TRANSPORTS OF LOVE ON WHICH OUR MINDS USED SO OFTEN AND WITH SUCH PERILOUS RAPTURE TO DWELL I FOUND A GENTLE CALM SETTLING OVER ME IF DEBARRED FROM LOVE
YOU SEE THAT HE FANCIES HIMSELF VANITY OF MEN THE CHOSEN OF MY HEART JUST AS THOUGH THERE WERE NO LEGAL BONDS NEVERTHELESS I HAVE NOT YET GOT BEYOND THAT EXTERNAL ATTRACTION WHICH GIVES US STRENGTH TO PUT UP WITH A GOOD DEAL
OCTOBER HOW DEEPLY YOUR LETTER MOVED ME ABOVE ALL WHEN I COMPARE OUR WIDELY DIFFERENT DESTINIES HOW BRILLIANT IS THE WORLD YOU ARE ENTERING HOW PEACEFUL THE RETREAT WHERE I SHALL END MY MODEST CAREER
WHY SHOULD WE NOT BOTH BE LAUGHING AND GAY IN YOUR PARIS WHENCE I SHALL CARRY YOU OFF NOW AND AGAIN TO MY BEAUTIFUL OASIS IN PROVENCE OH LOUISE DON'T SPOIL THE SPLENDID FUTURE WHICH AWAITS US BOTH DON'T DO THE MAD THINGS WITH WHICH YOU THREATEN ME
THE FORCE THUS DEVELOPED AT ONCE IMPETUOUS AND ENDURING SIMPLE AND DIVERSIFIED BRINGS FORTH ULTIMATELY THE FAMILY THAT NOBLE PRODUCT OF WOMANHOOD WHICH I REALIZE NOW IN ALL ITS ANIMATING BEAUTY
RAISED IN HIS NURSERY WITH A SPECIAL VIEW TO THIS ACQUISITION THE BARON HAVING FOUND HIS LONG LOST SON HAS NOW BUT ONE THOUGHT TO MARRY HIM AND MARRY HIM TO A GIRL OF GOOD FAMILY
AH DARLING MY LIFE UNROLLS ITSELF BEFORE MY EYES LIKE ONE OF THE GREAT HIGHWAYS OF FRANCE LEVEL AND EASY SHADED WITH EVERGREEN TREES THIS CENTURY WILL NOT SEE ANOTHER BONAPARTE
RETAINING PERFECT INDEPENDENCE WHAT COULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE MORE HONORABLE A CONTRACT OF THIS KIND DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE LEGAL CONTRACT AND EVEN TO THE SACRAMENT ITSELF COULD BE CONCLUDED ONLY BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME
INFUSE WITH PASSION THEN IF YOU WILL THIS FRIENDSHIP AND LET THE VOICE OF LOVE DISTURB ITS CALM ON MY PART I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO BRING MY FEELINGS INTO ACCORD WITH YOURS ONE THING ABOVE ALL I WOULD BEG OF YOU
DEAR THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH WOULD BESET MY LIFE HAD APPEARED TO ME CLEARLY AS IN A VISION AND I WAS SINCERELY ANXIOUS TO MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF THE MAN I MARRIED NOW IN THE SOLITUDE OF A LIFE LIKE OURS
UNDER PENALTY THEREFORE OF FORFEITING MY ESTEEM AND AFFECTION HE MUST GET HIMSELF CHOSEN DEPUTY FOR THE DEPARTMENT AT THE COMING ELECTIONS MY FAMILY WOULD SUPPORT HIS CANDIDATURE AND WE SHOULD THEN HAVE THE DELIGHT OF SPENDING ALL OUR WINTERS IN PARIS
WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN IN PERFECT TRUST AND MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF GIVING VARIETY TO THE INFINITE THIS IS THE TASK SET BEFORE EVERY TRUE WIFE THE ANSWER BEGINS TO DAWN ON ME AND I SHALL NOT REST TILL I HAVE MADE IT MINE
YOU WHO OUGHT TO FIND YOUR MATE AMONGST THE GREAT ONES OF THE EARTH THE CHILDREN OF YOUR RENEE WILL NOT LACK A ZEALOUS PROTECTRESS FAREWELL THEN FOR ME AT LEAST TO THE ROMANCES AND THRILLING ADVENTURES IN WHICH WE USED OURSELVES TO PLAY THE PART OF HEROINE
OLD GENTLEMAN OF GOOD FAMILY WHO HAS MADE HIMSELF RICH AFTER THE PROVINCIAL FASHION BY SCRAPING AND PARING
IN A COUNTRY LIFE SUCH AS OURS WILL BE OUGHT WE NOT TO BEAR IN MIND THE EVANESCENT NATURE OF PASSION IS IT NOT SIMPLE PRUDENCE TO MAKE PROVISION BEFOREHAND AGAINST THE CALAMITIES INCIDENT TO CHANGE OF FEELING
I INSIST TOO ON HIS STUDYING A GREAT DEAL BEFORE LONG I HOPE TO SEE HIM A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF MY FAMILY AND HIS MOTHER'S I HAVE TOLD HIM PLAINLY THAT I AM AMBITIOUS
THANKS TO AN IRON RAILING AT THE ENTRANCE FACING THE ROAD THIS SIMPLE FARM HAS A CERTAIN AIR OF BEING A COUNTRY SEAT
BUILT OF BIG ROUND PEBBLES SET IN LAYERS ALTERNATELY SLOPING OR UPRIGHT ACCORDING TO THE ARTISTIC TASTE OF THE MASON WHICH FINDS HERE ITS ONLY OUTLET THE MUD IN WHICH THEY ARE SET IS FALLING AWAY IN PLACES
ON THE OTHER HAND MARRIAGE WILL REMAIN WHEN PLEASURES HAVE VANISHED AND IT IS THE SOURCE OF INTERESTS FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN THOSE OF THE MAN AND WOMAN ENTERING ON THE ALLIANCE MIGHT IT NOT THEREFORE BE THAT THE ONLY REQUISITE FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE WAS FRIENDSHIP
BY DINT OF CLOSE STUDY I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS LOVE AMOUNTED TO A PASSION ONCE TRANSFORMED INTO AN IDOL WHOSE SLIGHTEST FROWN WOULD TURN HIM WHITE AND TREMBLING I REALIZED THAT I MIGHT VENTURE ANYTHING
FOR HIS COQUETTISH WHITE STONE HOUSE WITH ITS BLUE ROOF GLITTERING IN THE SUN THE GARDEN AND SURROUNDING WALKS ARE HORRIBLY DUSTY AND THE TREES SEEM BURNT UP
BUT ONLY ON THE EXPRESS CONDITION OF BEING ALLOWED TO WORK MY WILL UPON THE GRANGE AND MAKE A PARK THERE I HAVE DEMANDED FROM MY FATHER IN SET TERMS A GRANT OF WATER WHICH CAN BE BROUGHT THITHER FROM MAUCOMBE
THE BARON A VERY PIOUS OLD MAN PRACTISED THAT FINE THEOLOGICAL VIRTUE WHICH WE USED TO CULTIVATE AT BLOIS HOPE
SO HERE ARE MY BLACK HAIR AND MY BLACK EYES WHOSE LASHES ACT ACCORDING TO YOU LIKE VENETIAN BLINDS MY COMMANDING AIR AND MY WHOLE PERSON RAISED TO THE RANK OF SOVEREIGN POWER TEN YEARS HENCE DEAR
HE HOARDED HIS INCOME FOR HIM AND GUARDED CAREFULLY THE PORTION OF INHERITANCE WHICH FELL TO HIM
AH MY LOVE BY THE ARDOR WITH WHICH HE EMBRACED MY PLANS I CAN GAUGE THE DEPTH OF HIS AFFECTION TO CONCLUDE HERE IS A LETTER HE WROTE ME YESTERDAY FROM MARSEILLES WHERE HE HAD GONE TO SPEND A FEW HOURS MY SWEET RENEE
RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE CONVENT THAT AT LEAST IS PLAIN SO SOON AS I REALIZED THAT THE CONVENT WAS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO MARRYING LOUIS I HAD AS GIRLS SAY TO SUBMIT
SPARE ME THE ANNOYANCES TO WHICH THE STRANGENESS OF OUR MUTUAL POSITION MIGHT GIVE RISE TO OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHERS I AM NEITHER WHIMSICAL NOR PRUDISH AND SHOULD BE SORRY TO GET THAT REPUTATION
IN THIS TASK TOWARDS WHICH MY EVERY ENERGY SHALL BE BENT WHILE IT REMAINS CONCEALED FROM ALL BUT GOD AND YOU I AM VERY NEARLY HAPPY NOW BUT SHOULD I BE SO WITHOUT A FRIENDLY HEART IN WHICH TO POUR THE CONFESSION FOR HOW MAKE A CONFIDANT OF HIM
A FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS LEADS TO THE DOOR WHICH IS PROTECTED BY A PENT HOUSE ROOF
DO NOT FANCY I CONCLUDED THAT I ASK THIS FROM ANY WISH TO BE ECCENTRIC IT IS THE GREAT DESIRE I HAVE FOR YOUR RESPECT WHICH PROMPTS MY REQUEST IF YOU OWE THE CROWN OF YOUR LOVE MERELY TO THE LEGAL AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONY
AND ROOFED WITH HOLLOW TILES OF A GOOD RED CONSTITUTE THE GRANGE THE RAFTERS BEND UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THIS BRICK KILN THE WINDOWS INSERTED CASUALLY WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT SYMMETRY HAVE ENORMOUS SHUTTERS PAINTED YELLOW
BUT ABOVE ALL I HAVE INSISTED ON THE GREATEST SECRECY IN REGARD TO OUR DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS A HUSBAND WHO SUBMITS TO HIS WIFE'S YOKE IS JUSTLY HELD AN OBJECT OF RIDICULE A WOMAN'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE ENTIRELY CONCEALED
I SHALL TAKE A LEADING PART IN THE PUBLIC LIFE OF THE DISTRICT AND ON YOU SHALL FALL THE RAYS OF A GLORY WHICH WILL OWE ITS EXISTENCE TO THE DESIRE OF PLEASING YOU SO MUCH FOR MY PUPIL DEAR DO YOU SUPPOSE HE COULD HAVE WRITTEN LIKE THIS BEFORE
HIS FINE BLUE EYES ARE CAVERNOUS HE IS A LITTLE DEAF WHICH SUGGESTS THE KNIGHT OF THE SORROWFUL COUNTENANCE
HE WAS GREATLY ASTONISHED TO FIND ME AT ONCE SO REASONABLE AND SO APT AT REASONING BUT HE MADE ME A SOLEMN PROMISE AFTER WHICH I TOOK HIS HAND AND PRESSED IT AFFECTIONATELY WE WERE MARRIED AT THE END OF THE WEEK
MY ONE JOY AND IT IS SUPREME SPRINGS FROM THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING BROUGHT NEW LIFE TO MY HUSBAND BEFORE I HAVE BORNE HIM ANY CHILDREN LOUIS HAS REGAINED HIS YOUTH STRENGTH AND SPIRITS HE IS NOT THE SAME MAN
DURING THIS TIME I MADE A CLOSE STUDY OF MANY SMALL PERSONAL MATTERS WHICH HAVE MORE TO DO WITH LOVE THAN IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED IN SPITE OF MY COLDNESS LOUIS GREW BOLDER AND HIS NATURE EXPANDED I SAW ON HIS FACE A NEW EXPRESSION
WAS A FIRST MEETING BETWEEN YOUR SWEETHEART AND THE EXILE THE COMTE DE MAUCOMBE'S SERVANTS DONNED THEIR OLD LACED LIVERIES AND HATS THE COACHMAN HIS GREAT TOP BOOTS
THE IMPORTANT POINT OF SEPARATING MARRIAGE FROM MARITAL RIGHTS WAS SETTLED IN A CONVERSATION BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HE GAVE PROOF OF AN EXCELLENT TEMPER AND A TENDER HEART
SHALL EMBELLISH MY RETREAT AND THERE WILL I BE A MOTHER AMONG MY CHILDREN THE POETRY OF NATURE WHICH NOTHING CAN DESTROY SHALL HEDGE US ROUND AND STANDING LOYALLY AT THE POST OF DUTY WE NEED FEAR NO DANGER
FOR DEAR I HAVE MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION AFTER THE SNOWS OF SIBERIA A MAN IS READY ENOUGH TO SEE MERIT IN THOSE BLACK EYES WHICH ACCORDING TO YOU USED TO RIPEN FRUIT WITH A LOOK
WILL HE FIND OUT THERE ARE TWO I AM WRITING NONSENSE NOW AND AS HENCEFORTH I CAN ONLY BE FOOLISH BY PROXY I HAD BETTER STOP ONE KISS THEN ON EACH CHEEK MY LIPS ARE STILL VIRGINAL HE HAS ONLY DARED TO TAKE MY HAND
THE WHOLE STORY OF MY LIFE LIES BEFORE ME NOW ITS GREAT CRISES WILL BE THE TEETHING AND NUTRITION OF THE YOUNG MASTERS DE L'ESTORADE AND THE MISCHIEF THEY DO TO MY SHRUBS AND ME TO EMBROIDER THEIR CAPS
THE LOVE WHICH IS MY PRIDE AND WHENCE I HAVE DRAWN AS FROM A MAGIC FOUNTAIN FRESH LIFE
WHOM THE FATHER INTERVIEWED IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN DECLARED THAT HE HAD SEEN HIM TAKEN BY THE RUSSIANS
SO YOU MUST NARRATE TO ME IN FULL ALL YOUR ADVENTURES DESCRIBE YOUR BALLS AND PARTIES TELL ME WHAT YOU WEAR WHAT FLOWERS CROWN YOUR LOVELY GOLDEN LOCKS AND WHAT ARE THE WORDS AND MANNERS OF THE MEN YOU MEET
WE DISCOVERED LATER THAT OUR JAPANESE FRIEND WAS OF THE FAMILY OF THE EMPEROR AND WAS HERE ON A DIPLOMATIC MISSION OLD AND NEW PALACE ONE CANNOT WELL WRITE A BOOK ON BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS OF SAN FRANCISCO
WE HAVE HERE THE VERY BEST TEA THIS MAY BE TAKEN AS A SAMPLE OF WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN VISITING CHINATOWN'S RESTAURANTS AND WHILE WE CONFESS TO HAVING SOME EXCELLENT DISHES SERVED US IN CHINATOWN OUR PREFERENCE LIES IN OTHER PATHS OF ENDEAVOR
THE ORDINARY SERVICE WAS OF TEA AND RICE CAKES SERVED FROM LACQUERED TRAYS IN GAUDY ROOMS AND THE ADMIRING VISITORS COULD WELL IMAGINE THEMSELVES IN FAR OFF CATHAY THEN CAME THE FIRE AND CHINATOWN WITH THE REST OF THE DOWN TOWN PORTION OF SAN FRANCISCO
INTO THESE WE ARRANGED THE FOOD THAT WAS UNCONSUMED AND WHEN WE WENT AWAY WE CARRIED IT WITH US TO CAP THE CLIMAX THE JAPANESE STRIPPED THE ROOM OF ITS BOUNTEOUS DECORATION OF CHRYSANTHEMUMS AND PILED THEM INTO OUR ARMS AND WE WENT HOME LOADED WITH FOOD AND FLOWERS
THERE IS NO ONE THE VERY BEST I COULD GIVE YOU TWO LET IT BE TWO THEN WAS OUR IMMEDIATE REJOINDER AND HERE IS WHAT HE GAVE US AS THE BEST RECIPES OF THE GIANDUJA
AND THE AFFAIRS OF OTHER DINERS ARE OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO THEM THERE IS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND UNCONSCIOUSNESS MOST PLEASING AFTER HAVING EXPERIENCED THOSE OTHER RESTAURANTS WHERE IT SEEMS TO BE THE BUSINESS OF ALL THE REST OF THE GUESTS TO KNOW JUST WHAT YOU ARE EATING AND DRINKING
HE TOOK US TO A DWELLING HOUSE IN O'FARRELL STREET HAVING GIVEN PREVIOUS NOTICE OF OUR COMING THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE OUTSIDE TO INDICATE THAT IT WAS ANYTHING BUT A RESIDENCE
AND WITH QUEER HOUSES AND QUEERER ARTICLES ON SALE THERE IS ALWAYS PLENTY OF UNINITIATED TO KEEP THE GUIDES BUSY BUT FROM A CITY OF MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ORIENTALS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENLIGHTENED CITY AN ASIATIC CITY THAT HAD ITS OWN LAWS AND EXECUTED ITS CRIMINALS
BUT HAD HEARD OF SUCH A PLACE AND WHEN WE RECEIVED WORD THAT WE WOULD BE PERMITTED TO HAVE A DINNER THERE WE INVITED A NEWSPAPER FRIEND WHO WAS IN THE CITY FROM NEW YORK TOGETHER WITH TWO OTHER FRIENDS
AND SHUDDERING IN A DELIGHTFUL HORROR AT THE RECUMBENT OPIUM SMOKERS POINTED OUT TO THEM BY THE INDUSTRIOUS GUIDE AND WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN INTO ONE OF THE GAMBLING HOUSES AND SHOWN THE DOUBLE DOORS
PRESIDES OVER THE TINY KITCHEN IN THE REAR OF THE ROOM DEVOTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND FAMILY AFFAIRS SOFT VOICED RITA WITH HER DEMURE AIR AND HER RESEMBLANCE TO EVANGELINE WITH HER CROSSED APRON STRINGS AND DELICATE FEATURES TAKES YOUR ORDER
YOU WILL FIND AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNCONVENTIONALITY THAT IS DELIGHTFUL TO THE BOHEMIAN THERE IS NO IRKSOME ESPIONAGE ON THE PART OF OTHER PATRONS ALL OF WHOM ARE THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTENDING STRICTLY TO THEIR OWN BUSINESS
WHILE COOKING ADD A PINT OF MEAT STOCK A LITTLE BUTTER AND SOME ANISE SEED WHEN DONE PUT IN A SOUP TUREEN AND SERVE TO REMOVE THE SNAILS USE SMALL WOODEN TOOTHPICKS A BREATH OF THE ORIENT
WELL BEATEN WITH A LITTLE FLOUR SPRINKLE THESE WITH A LITTLE LIME JUICE AND FRY TO A DELICATE BROWN IN BUTTER ADDING SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE AT THE GIANDUJA AS AT ALL OTHER ITALIAN RESTAURANTS NOT MUCH AFFECTED BY AMERICANS
AND INTO THIS PUT THE ONION AND MARROW AND FRY TO A DELICATE BROWN NOW ADD ONE SCANT CUP OF RICE STIRRING CONSTANTLY AND INTO THIS PUT A PINCH OF SAFFRON THAT HAS BEEN BRUISED WHEN THE RICE TAKES ON A BROWN COLOR ADD SLOWLY
WITH THE MOST UTTER DISREGARD FOR AMERICAN LAWS IT HAS CHANGED INTO ONE OF THE MOST LAW ABIDING PARTS OF THE GREAT CITY WITH THE PASSING OF THE QUEUE CAME THE ADOPTION OF THE AMERICAN STYLE OF DRESSING AND MUCH OF THE PICTURESQUENESS
GOOD COOKING AND EXCELLENT SERVICE IT MATTERS NOT WHETHER YOU TAKE THEIR THIRTY FIVE CENT LUNCHEON OR ORDER A MOST ELABORATE MEAL YOU WILL FIND THAT THE SERVICE IS JUST WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE WE ASKED BRENTI WHAT HE CONSIDERED HIS MOST FAMOUS DISH
WE SUPPOSE IT IS ALL IN THE POINT OF VIEW AND OUR POINT OF VIEW IS THAT THERE IS NOTHING EXCEPT SUPERFICIALITY IN THE ORDINARY CHINESE RESTAURANTS FREQUENTED BY AMERICANS
FORKS WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE AS WELL AS THE LITTLE STICKS THAT THE ORIENTALS USE SO DEFTLY AT EACH PLACE WAS A BEAUTIFUL LACQUER TRAY ABOUT TWELVE BY EIGHTEEN INCHES A PAIR OF CHOPSTICKS A FORK AND A TEASPOON
SERVE CHATEAUBRIAND SAUCE IN A BOWL THE SECOND IS COLD FILLET OF SAND DABS PALACE SELECT SIX NICE FRESH SAND DABS RAISE THE FILLETS FROM THE BONE SKIN AND PARE NICELY
SAN FRANCISCO'S WORLD FAMED CHINATOWN LIKE THE REST OF THE CITY IS CHANGED SINCE THE BIG FIRE AND THE CHINATOWN OF TODAY IS BUT A REMINISCENCE OF THE OLD ORIENTAL CITY THAT WAS SET IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST THRIVING OCCIDENTAL METROPOLIS
RISOTTO ALA MILANAISE ONIONS CHOP FINE MARROW AND LITTLE BUTTER RICE SAFFRON CHICKEN BROTH WEN COOK ADD FRESH BUTTER AND PARMESAN CHEESE SEASONED
AND SOON THE HANDMAIDENS APPEARED WITH THINLY SLICED RAW FISH SERVED WITH SOY SAUCE ORDINARILY ONE CAN IMAGINE NOTHING MORE REPULSIVE THAN A DISH OF RAW FISH BUT WE WERE TEMPTED AND DID EAT AND FOUND IT MOST DELICIOUS DELICATE
OF THE OLD CHINATOWN HAS DISAPPEARED BUT WITH THE CHANGED CONDITIONS THERE HAS COME A CHANGE IN THE RESTAURANT LIFE OF THE QUARTER AND NOW A NUMBER OF PLACES HAVE BEEN OPENED TO CATER TO AMERICANS AND ON EVERY HAND ONE SEES CHOP SUEY SIGNS AND CHINESE NOODLES
NOW FOLLOWED THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE A TUB OF WATER WAS BROUGHT IN AND IN THIS WAS SWIMMING A LIVE FISH APPARENTLY OF THE CARP FAMILY AFTER BEING ON VIEW FOR A FEW MINUTES IT WAS REMOVED
IN THE HEART OF ITALY WHAT A RELIEF IT IS SOMETIMES TO HAVE A GOOD WAITER SAY YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WANT WILL YOU LET ME BRING YOU THE BEST THERE IS IN THE HOUSE SOMETIMES YOU KNOW YOU REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
BROUGHT FROM CHINA DIFFERENT FROM THE TURTLE THEY HAVE HERE AND WE COOK IT CHINA STYLE EELS COME FROM CHINA AND THEY ARE COOKED CHINA STYLE TOO WHAT IS CHINA STYLE
AND A SMALL BUNCH OF PARSLEY CHOPPED FINE PUT THE POT OVER THE FIRE AND WHEN THE ONIONS ARE BROWNED STIR IN SOME WHITE WINE OR MARSALA AND THEN PUT IN THE SNAILS COVER AND LET SIMMER FOR THIRTY FIVE MINUTES
HE PROTESTED THAT THERE WERE SO MANY GOOD THINGS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO NAME JUST ONE AS BEING THE BEST YOU SEE WE HAVE FISH FINS THEY ARE VERY GOOD SNAILS CHINA STYLE VERY GOOD TOO THEN WE HAVE TURTLE
AND SEASON WITH SALT AND PAPRIKA ARRANGE THEM IN AN EARTHENWARE DISH CUT IN JULIENNE ONE STALK OF CELERY ONE GREEN PEPPER ONE CUCUMBER TWO OR THREE TOMATOES DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE
AND HE GAVE US THIS RECIPE PALACE GRILL SALAD SELECT THREE HEARTS OF CELERY AND CUT THEM JULIENNE CUT SOME PINEAPPLE AND PIMENTOES INTO DICE MIX ALL WELL TOGETHER IN A BOWL AND ADD MAYONNAISE SAUCE AND A LITTLE WHIPPED CREAM
WAS SHREDDED AND PRESSED LOBSTER THE FRUITCAKE DEVELOPED INTO PRESSED DARK MEAT OF CHICKEN WITH AN ICING OF PRESSED AND GLAZED WHITE MEAT OF THE SAME FOWL FOLLOWING THIS CAME THE SECOND SERVICE OF TEA
SAN FRANCISCO AND THE PALACE HOTEL WERE ALMOST SYNONYMOUS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND IT WAS CONCEDED BY TRAVELERS THAT NOWHERE ELSE WAS THERE A HOSTELRY TO EQUAL THIS GREAT HOTEL
PASSED AWAY IN THE REBUILDING THE OWNERS OF THE PROPERTIES CONCLUDED TO GIVE THE QUARTER A MORE CHINESE ASPECT AND PAGODA LIKE STRUCTURES ARE NOW TO BE FOUND IN ALL PARTS OF THE SECTION THE CURIOSITY OF THE TOURIST IS AN AVAILABLE ASSET TO CHINATOWN
AND STIR IN WITH THE OYSTERS ADDING SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE WHEN THE EGGS BEGIN TO STIFFEN POUR THE OYSTERS OVER AND TURN THE OMELET TOGETHER SERVE ON HOT PLATE WITH A DASH OF PAPRIKA THIS IS THE RECIPE OF
THIS TIME IN CUPS OF A RARE YELLOW COLOR AND BEAUTIFUL DESIGN WITH SIMILAR TEAPOT THE NEXT COURSE WAS A MIXTURE OF IMMATURE VEGETABLES SERVED IN A SORT OF SAUTE THESE WERE SPROUTING BEANS LENTILS
YOU WILL CERTAINLY MISS SOMETHING IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT HIS GOOD OFFICES THIS WAS THE CASE WITH US ONE DAY WHEN WE WERE OVER AT FIFTEEN FORTY NINE STOCKTON STREET NEAR WASHINGTON SQUARE AT THE GIANDUJA THE PROPER PRONUNCIATION OF THIS
THE CUPS AND SAUCERS WERE OF A MOST DELICATE BLUE AND WHITE WARE WITH TEAPOT TO MATCH OUR FIRST CUP WAS TAKEN STANDING IN DEFERENCE TO A JAPANESE CUSTOM WHERE ALL DRANK TO THE HOST
THE INGREDIENTS ARE SO NUMEROUS AND SO VARIED WITH OCCASION THAT ONE IS TEMPTED TO IMAGINE THEM MADE OF THE TABLE LEAVINGS AND THAT IS NOT AT ALL PLEASANT TO CONTEMPLATE
BUT NEITHER IS CONSIDERED AMONG THE FINE DISHES SERVED TO CHINESE EPICURES IT IS MUCH AS IF ONE OF OUR BEST RESTAURANTS WERE TO ADVERTISE HASH AS ITS SPECIALTY BOTH THESE DISHES MIGHT BE TERMED GLORIFIED HASH
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT DURING THE MEAL WHICH LASTED FROM SEVEN UNTIL PAST MIDNIGHT SAKI WAS SERVED CONSTANTLY YET NO ONE FELT ITS INFLUENCE IN MORE THAN A SENSE OF INCREASED EXHILARATION
AND ADD FINELY CHOPPED GREEN PEPPERS LET IT COOK AWHILE THEN ADD A FINELY CHOPPED CLOVE OF GARLIC AND A LITTLE SAGE PUT IN A SMALL GLASS OF MARSALA WINE TOMATO SAUCE
WE ASKED ONE OF THE MANAGERS AT THE HANG FAR LOW WHAT HE WOULD ORDER IF HE WISHED TO GET THE BEST DISH PREPARED IN THE RESTAURANT AND HE WAS EVEN MORE EMPHATIC IN HIS SHRUGS THAN THE FRENCH OR ITALIAN MANAGERS
IS AS FOLLOWS TAKE A LAMB CHOP A PIECE OF CALF BRAIN ONE SWEETBREAD A SLICE OF VEAL A FRESH MUSHROOM SLICED ITALIAN SQUASH A PIECE OF ASPARAGUS OR OF CAULIFLOWER AND DIP THESE INTO A BATTER MADE OF AN EGG
TO THE BON VIVANT THE GRILLS OF THE PALACE HOTEL CONTAINED MORE TO ENHANCE THE JOY OF LIVING THAN ANYWHERE ELSE AND HERE THE CHEFS PRIDED THEMSELVES WITH PROVIDING THE BEST IN THE LAND
WHAT WAS EMBODIED IN THE WORDS WEN COOK WAS THE ESSENTIAL OF THE RECIPE AND HERE IS THE WAY WE GOT IT CHOP ONE LARGE ONION FINE CUT A BEEF MARROW INTO SMALL DICE AND STIR IT WITH THE CHOPPED ONION PUT A SMALL PIECE OF BUTTER IN A FRYING PAN
IT IS CUSTOMARY TO LET THE EMPTIED BOTTLES REMAIN ON THE TABLE UNTIL THE CLOSE OF THE MEAL AND THERE WAS A MIGHTY SHOWING IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO EAT ALL THAT WAS SET BEFORE US
THIS IS ONE OF THE GOOD ITALIAN RESTAURANTS OF THE LATIN QUARTER
BEFORE THE MEAL WAS OVER SEVERAL OF US BECAME QUITE EXPERT IN USING THE CHOPSTICKS WHEN WE WERE SEATED IN CAME TWO LITTLE JAPANESE WOMEN IN FULL NATIVE COSTUME BEARING A SERVICE OF TEA
WHEN THE REST OF THE STOCK IS BOILING POACH IT IN THE FILLETS OF SAND DAB THEN REMOVE FROM THE FIRE AND LET GET COLD PUT THE GARNISHING AROUND THE FILLETS AND PUT ON ICE TO GET IN JELLY
AND USUALLY WHEN THAT IS THE CASE YOU ARE NOT VERY HUNGRY THAT IS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO TRY NEW THINGS IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WANT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO ORDER IN EITHER INSTANCE OUR ADVICE IS IF THE WAITER GETS CONFIDENTIAL AND OFFERS HIS ASSISTANCE
PROPRIETOR AND ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD ACCOMPANIED US TO THE DOOR WITH MANY BOWS AND GESTICULATIONS WISHING US BEST OF LUCK AND WE WENT BACK TO OUR HOMES IN THE DESOLATED CITY WITH THE FEELING OF HAVING BEEN TRANSPORTED TO FAIRYLAND OF THE ORIENT
STIR FOR TWENTY MINUTES UNTIL A FOAM RISES THEN TAKE OUT AND WASH THOROUGHLY UNTIL THE WATER RUNS CLEAR PUT IN A LARGE POT A PINT OF VIRGIN OLIVE OIL FOUR LARGE ONIONS AND EIGHT CLOVES OF GARLIC ALL CHOPPED FINE
ONE OF THE WOMEN CAME IN BEARING ALOFT A LARGE SILVER TRAY ON WHICH REPOSED A MAMMOTH CRAYFISH OR CALIFORNIA LOBSTER THIS APPEARED TO BE COVERED WITH SHREDDED COCOANUT AND WHEN IT WAS PLACED BEFORE THE HOST FOR SERVING HE WAS AT LOSS
AND THE MANY CONTRIVANCES USED TO PREVENT POLICE INTERFERENCE WITH THE INNOCENT GAMES OF FAN TAN AND THEN WERE SHOWN THE SECRET UNDERGROUND PASSAGE LEADING FROM ONE OF THE GAMBLING HOUSES TO THE STAGE OF THE GREAT CHINESE THEATRE TWO BLOCKS AWAY THEY WENT HOME READY TO BELIEVE ANYTHING TOLD THEM ABOUT
AND THOSE WHO ONCE ATE OF ARBOGAST'S CALIFORNIA OYSTER OMELET INVARIABLY CALLED FOR IT AGAIN AND AGAIN
ERNEST ARBOGAST THE CHEF FOR MANY YEARS OF THE OLD PALACE THE SLIGHTLY COPPERY TASTE OF THE CALIFORNIA OYSTERS GIVES A PIQUANCY TO THE FLAVOR OF THE OMELET THAT CAN BE OBTAINED IN NO OTHER WAY
DECORATED WITH A BORDER OF MASHED POTATOES OVER THE FILLET MIGNON POUR STUFFED PIMENTOES COVERED WITH A SAUCE MADE OF FRESH MUSHROOMS
THE RECIPE FOR THESE IS AS FOLLOWS SNAILS A LA BORDELAISE PUT TEN POUNDS OF SNAILS IN A COVERED BARREL AND KEEP FOR TEN DAYS THEN PUT IN A TUB WITH A HANDFUL OF SALT AND A QUARTER OF A GALLON OF VINEGAR
TRIM SOME SELECT FILLET MIGNON OF BEEF ABOUT FOUR OUNCES OF EACH NICELY SAUTE THESE IN A FRYING PAN WITH CLARIFIED BUTTER ON A HOT FIRE DRESS ON A SMALL ROUND PLANK ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF INCHES IN DIAMETER
THERE IS LITTLE OF THE OBNOXIOUS POSING THAT ONE FINDS IN RESTAURANTS OF THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS FOR WHILE ITALIANS IN COMMON WITH ALL OTHER LATINS ARE NATURAL BORN POSEURS THEY ARE NOT OFFENSIVE IN IT BUT RATHER IMPRESS YOU WITH THE SAME FEELING AS THE ANTICS OF A CHILD
THESE PLATES CONTAINED WHAT APPEARED TO BE CAKE ONE SEEMING TO BE ANGEL FOOD WITH ICING AND THE OTHER FRUIT CAKE WITH THE SAME COVERING WITH THESE CAME BOWLS OF SOUP SERVED IN LACQUER WARE MADE OF GLUTINOUS NESTS OF SWALLOWS
BUT JAPANESE CUSTOM FORBIDS SUCH A BREACH OF ETIQUETTE AS AN INDICATION THAT THE FOOD WAS NOT PERFECTION CONSEQUENTLY THE SERVING MAIDS APPEARED BEARING SIX CARVED TEAK BOXES AND PLACED ONE AT EACH PLATE
ITALIAN SQUASH WHEN IN SEASON ASPARAGUS OR CAULIFLOWER FRIED IN FRESH BUTTER DIPPED IN BEATEN EGGS LIME JUS FRITTO MISTO MEANS FRIED MIXTURE AND THE RECIPE AS WE FINALLY ELUCIDATED IT
A BREAKFAST IN THE LADIES GRILL WITH AN OMELET OF CALIFORNIA OYSTERS TOAST AND COFFEE WAS A MEAL LONG TO BE REMEMBERED POSSIBLY THE MOST FAMOUS DISH OF THE OLD PALACE WAS THIS ONE OF OMELET WITH CALIFORNIA OYSTERS
AND LIKE ALL OTHER PROPRIETORS HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID WITH HANDS EMPHASIZING HIS WORDS WE HAVE SO MANY FINE DISHES OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT ONE SELDOM SEES A CHINAMAN EATING IN THE RESTAURANTS THAT ARE MOST ATTRACTIVE TO AMERICANS SOME SERVE BOTH WHITE AND YELLOW AND OTHERS SERVE BUT THE CHINESE AND A FEW FAVORED WHITE FRIENDS PROBABLY THE BEST RESTAURANT IN CHINATOWN
AND SOON COMES THE BOOMING SOUND FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE RANGE THAT ANNOUNCES TO ALL PATRONS AS WELL AS TO SOME WHO MAY BE IN THE VICINITY ON THE STREET THAT YOUR ORDER IS READY AND THEN EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE EATING
FOR NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE TOLD HIM WHAT TO DO IT DEVELOPED THAT THE SHREDDED MASS ON TOP WAS THE MEAT OF THE LOBSTER WHICH HAD BEEN REMOVED LEAVING THE SHELL FISH IN PERFECT FORM IT WAS SERVED COLD WITH A PECULIAR SAUCE
WHEN READY TO SERVE DECORATE AROUND THE DISH WITH ANY KIND OF SALAD YOU LIKE AND WITH BEETS CAPERS OLIVES AND MARINATED MUSHROOMS THIS MUST BE SERVED VERY COLD AND YOU MAY SERVE MAYONNAISE SAUCE ON THE SIDE WE ASKED DAUVILLER WHAT HE CONSIDERED HIS MOST DELICATE SALAD
SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE BEAT THE EGGS TO A FROTH AND STIR IN THE ONION CHOPPED FINE PUT THE EGGS INTO AN OMELET PAN OVER A SLOW FIRE MIX THE FLOUR AND BUTTER TO A SOFT PASTE WITH A LITTLE CREAM
CHICKEN BROTH AS NEEDED UNTIL THE RICE IS THOROUGHLY COOKED THEN ADD A LUMP OF FRESH BUTTER ABOUT THE SIZE OF A WALNUT AND SPRINKLE LIBERALLY WITH GRATED PARMESAN CHEESE SEASONING TO TASTE WITH PEPPER AND SALT THIS IS TO BE SERVED WITH CHICKEN OR VEAL
WITH THE BONE OF THE SAND DAB WELL CLEANED MAKE A STOCK WITH ONE BOTTLE OF RIESLING JUICE OF ONE LEMON AND SEASONING ADD CHERVIL AND TARRAGON SEASON TO TASTE AND COOK THE JULIENNE INGREDIENTS WITH SOME OF THE STOCK
AND HE SAID HE WOULD GIVE US TWO AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DECIDE WHICH WAS THE BEST AND MOST DISTINCTIVE THESE ARE THE RECIPES AS HE WROTE THEM FOR US PLANKED FILLET MIGNON
AND IT WAS PREPARED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER OYSTER OMELET FOR TWO TAKE SIX EGGS ONE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA OYSTERS ONE SMALL ONION ONE TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER
THE SECOND RECIPE WAS FOR FRITTO MISTO AND HE WROTE IT AS FOLLOWS FRITTO MISTO LAMB CHOPS AND BRAINS BREADED SWEETBREADS ESCALLOP OF VEAL FRESH MUSHROOMS
BEFORE TAKING FROM THE PAN ADD HALF A TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER AND SERVE ON A HOT PLATE LAZZARINI ALSO MAKES A SPECIALTY OF SNAILS AND THEY ARE WELL WORTH TRYING WHILE YOU ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE UNUSUAL THINGS TO EAT
PREPARED IN SUCH PERFECT WAYS AS TO MAKE A MEAL AT THE PALACE THE PERFECTION OF GASTRONOMIC ART THERE ARE THREE DISTINCT ERAS TO THE HISTORY OF THE PALACE HOTEL THE FIRST BEING FROM EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX TO EIGHTEEN NINETY
THEN FOLLOWED SAKI IN LITTLE ARTISTIC BOTTLES AND SAKI CUPS THAT HOLD NOT MUCH MORE THAN A DOUBLE TABLESPOONFUL SAKI IS THE JAPANESE WINE MADE OF RICE AND IS TAKEN IN LIBERAL QUANTITIES AT EACH SERVING
SOME ONE DRANK TO SOME ONE ELSE THEN A RETURN OF THE COMPLIMENT WAS NECESSARY HAVING ALWAYS HEARD THAT ORIENTALS TURNED MENUS TOPSY TURVY WE WERE NOT AT ALL SURPRISED WHEN THE LITTLE SERVING WOMEN BROUGHT TO EACH OF US TWO SILVER PLATES AND SET THEM ON OUR TRAYS
HERE IS SERVED SUCH A VARIETY OF STRANGE DISHES THAT ONE HAS TO BE A BRAVE BOHEMIAN INDEED TO PARTAKE WITHOUT QUESTION ORDINARILY WHEN CHINESE RESTAURANTS ARE MENTIONED BUT TWO DISHES ARE THOUGHT OF CHOP SUEY AND CHOW MAIN
CHICKEN A LA LEON D'ORO CUT A SPRING CHICKEN INTO PIECES PLACE THESE IN A PAN CONTAINING HOT OLIVE OIL AND SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER TURN THE CHICKEN UNTIL IT IS THOROUGHLY BROWNED
ANDREA SPEAKS ITALIAN SO FLUENTLY AND SO RAPIDLY THAT IT GIVES YOU THE IMPRESSION OF A QUICK RUSHING STREAM OF PURE WATER TUMBLING OVER THE STONES OF A STEEP DECLIVITY HE IS NOT YET OLD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK ITALIAN
AS YOU SIT EITHER IN CURTAINED ALCOVE OR AT THE COMMON TABLE IN THE MAIN ROOM LITTLE ANDREA WILL VISIT YOU WITH HIS CAT BOTH ARE INSTITUTIONS OF THE PLACE AND ONE IS PRONE TO WONDER HOW A CAT CAN HAVE SO MUCH PATIENCE WITH A LITTLE BOY
ONE OF THE LITTLE OUT OF THE WAY RESTAURANTS OF THE ITALIAN QUARTER IS THE LEON D'ORO AT FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE GRANT AVENUE AND IT IS ONE OF THE SURPRISES OF THAT DISTRICT LAZZARINI HE WITH THE BIG VOICE
BUT WHEN WE WERE USHERED INTO THE LARGE FRONT ROOM WE FOUND IT BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED WITH IMMENSE CHRYSANTHEMUMS AND GLITTERING WITH SILVER AND CUT GLASS ON A MAGNIFICENTLY ARRANGED TABLE
FIRST LET US GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE DIFFICULTY UNDER WHICH WE SECURED THESE RECIPES BY PRINTING THEM JUST AS HE WROTE THEM DOWN FOR US AND THEN WE SHALL ELABORATE A LITTLE AND SHOW THE RESULT OF SKILLFUL QUESTIONING THIS IS THE WAY HE WROTE THE RECIPE FOR RISOTTO MILANAISE
THE WAYS THAT ARE DARK AND TRICKS THAT ARE VAIN FOR THEY WERE SURE THE HEATHEN CHINEE WAS PECULIAR CHINESE RESTAURANT LIFE NEVER APPEALED TO BOHEMIANS AND WHEN IT BECAME NECESSARY TO ENTERTAIN VISITORS WITH A TRIP TO A CHINATOWN RESTAURANT
AND ALSO A SALAD MADE OF SHARK FINS WE ATE THE SOUP AND SALAD AND FOUND IT GOOD AND THEN MADE TENTATIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE CAKE TO OUR GREAT SURPRISE WE DISCOVERED THE ANGEL FOOD TO BE FISH AND THE ICING
THE CITY THAT WAS THERE HAS NEVER BEEN MUCH OF CHINATOWN THAT SAVORED OF BOHEMIANISM BUT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE VOGUE FOR VISITORS TO MAKE A TRIP THROUGH ITS MYSTERIOUS ALLEYS PEERING INTO THE FEARSOME DARK DOORWAYS LISTENING TO THE OMINOUS SLAMMING DOORS OF THE CLUBS
DESIRING TO OBSERVE IN FITTING MANNER A BIRTHDAY ANNIVERSARY WE ASKED A JAPANESE FRIEND IF HE COULD SECURE ADMISSION FOR A LITTLE PARTY AT A RESTAURANT NOTED FOR SERVING NONE BUT THE HIGHEST CLASS JAPANESE WE DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE THE RESTAURANT WAS
AND WITH A FLAVOR OF RAW OYSTERS NEXT CAME THE THIRD SERVICE OF TEA THIS TIME IN A DEEP RED WARE THEN CAME A DESSERT OF UNUSUAL FLAVOR AND APPEARANCE FOLLOWED BY PRESERVED GINGER AND FRUIT
THE SECOND FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY TO NINETEEN O SIX AND THE THIRD FROM NINETEEN O SIX TO THE PRESENT DAY IN THE EARLIER DAYS THE GRILLS BOTH THAT FOR GENTLEMEN AND THAT FOR LADIES WERE NOTED FOR THEIR MAGNIFICENT SERVICE AND THEIR WONDERFUL COOKING
FOR HE TALKS WITHOUT EVER EXPECTING AN ANSWER LAZZARINI UNDERSTANDS THE ART AND SCIENCE OF COOKING AND SOME OF THE DISHES HE PREPARES ARE SO UNUSUAL THAT ONE GOES AGAIN AND AGAIN TO PARTAKE OF THEM POSSIBLY HIS BEST DISH IS THE FOLLOWING
PEAS AND A NUMBER OF OTHERS WITH WHICH WE WERE UNFAMILIAR THE WHOLE WAS DELICATELY FLAVORED WITH A PECULIAR SAUCE AFTER A SHORT WAIT DURING WHICH THE SAKI BOTTLES CIRCULATED FREELY

LEFT SCANT LEISURE FOR THE CULTIVATION OF THE ARTS AND SCIENCES THERE WAS LITTLE MONEY IN PRIVATE PURSES OR PUBLIC TREASURIES TO BE DEDICATED TO SCHOOLS LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS FEW THERE WERE WITH TIME TO READ LONG AND WIDELY
AND THAT PROVINCE WAS BROUGHT INTO LINE WITH CONNECTICUT RHODE ISLAND AND NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE PROPERTY NOT RELIGIOUS FAITH WAS THE TEST FOR THE SUFFRAGE GROWTH OF RELIGIOUS TOLERATION
BUT THAT ANARCHY NOWHERE LASTED LONGER THAN FORTY EIGHT HOURS FROM THE DAY ON WHICH WILLIAM REACHED SAINT JAMES'S NOT EVEN THE MOST UNPOPULAR AGENTS OF THE FALLEN GOVERNMENT NOT EVEN THE MINISTERS OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
WHEN AT LENGTH THE ESTATES MET THEIR DELIBERATIONS WERE CARRIED ON WITH PERFECT FREEDOM AND IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH ANCIENT FORMS THERE WAS INDEED AFTER THE FIRST FLIGHT OF JAMES
FROM THE ORDINARY METHODS PRESCRIBED BY THE LAW THE CONVENTION WHICH MET AT WESTMINSTER THOUGH SUMMONED BY IRREGULAR WRITS WAS CONSTITUTED ON THE EXACT MODEL OF A REGULAR PARLIAMENT NO MAN WAS INVITED TO THE UPPER HOUSE
THE CROWN AND CHURCH IN ENGLAND HAD LONG LOOKED UPON IT WITH DISFAVOR
THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF SCOTLAND HAVING BEEN DURING MANY YEARS FAR MORE OPPRESSIVE AND CORRUPT THAN THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND SHOULD HAVE FALLEN WITH A FAR HEAVIER RUIN THE MOVEMENT AGAINST THE LAST KING OF THE HOUSE OF STUART WAS IN ENGLAND CONSERVATIVE
WHICH BY OFFERING TO US INFALLIBLE DEMONSTRATION CUTS OFF AT ONCE ALL DOUBT AND DIFFICULTY BY THIS ARGUMENT TOO WE MAY PROVE THE INFINITY OF THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTES
MORE THAN THE REVERENCE PAID BY THE PRELATIST TO THE ANCIENT HOLIDAYS OF THE CHURCH THAT SUCH REVERENCE MAY BE CARRIED TO AN ABSURD EXTREME IS TRUE BUT A PHILOSOPHER MAY PERHAPS BE INCLINED TO THINK THE OPPOSITE EXTREME NOT LESS ABSURD
WAS ATTACKED BY A CROWD OF PRESBYTERIANS FROM THE MEETING HOUSES WITH WHOM WERE MINGLED MANY OF THEIR FIERCER BRETHREN FROM THE HILLS IT WAS A SUNDAY BUT TO RABBLE A CONGREGATION OF PRELATISTS WAS HELD TO BE A WORK OF NECESSITY AND MERCY
BY ONE CIRCUMSTANCE OR ANOTHER THE MIDDLE COLONIES WERE THUS EARLY CHARACTERIZED BY DIVERSITY RATHER THAN UNIFORMITY OF OPINION DUTCH PROTESTANTS HUGUENOTS QUAKERS BAPTISTS PRESBYTERIANS NEW LIGHTS MORAVIANS LUTHERANS
TO BE THE CREATOR UPHOLDER AND RULER OF THE WORLD
AND WHO FINDING FROM MATHEMATICS THAT THE UNDERSTANDING FREQUENTLY LEADS TO TRUTH THROUGH OBSCURITY AND CONTRARY TO FIRST APPEARANCES HAVE TRANSFERRED THE SAME HABIT OF THINKING TO SUBJECTS WHERE IT OUGHT NOT TO HAVE PLACE
WERE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE OFFENSIVE TO WILLIAM WHO HAD IN THE SOUTH OF THE ISLAND PROTECTED EVEN BENEDICTINES AND FRANCISCANS FROM INSULT AND SPOLIATION BUT THOUGH HE HAD AT THE REQUEST OF A LARGE NUMBER OF THE NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN OF SCOTLAND
THEREFORE HAD A POLITICAL ROLE TO PLAY HERE AS IN ENGLAND ABLE BISHOPS AND FAR SEEING LEADERS FIRMLY GRASPED THIS FACT ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND REDOUBLED THEIR EFFORTS TO AUGMENT THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHURCH IN PROVINCIAL AFFAIRS
BUT IT SEEMS A GREAT PARTIALITY NOT TO PERCEIVE THAT THE SAME ARGUMENT EXTENDS EQUALLY TO THE DEITY SO FAR AS WE HAVE ANY CONCEPTION OF HIM AND THAT THE MIND CAN AT LEAST IMAGINE HIM TO BE NON EXISTENT OR HIS ATTRIBUTES TO BE ALTERED
OF MERE EXISTENCE AFTER THE FIRST CLEARINGS WERE OPENED IN THE FORESTS THOSE EFFORTS WERE REDOUBLED AND WITH LENGTHENING YEARS TOLD UPON THE THOUGHT AND SPIRIT OF THE LAND THE APPEARANCE DURING THE STRUGGLE WITH ENGLAND
WHICH I AM AFRAID CAN NEVER BE ASCERTAINED WITH CERTAINTY FROM ANY OTHER TOPIC FOR HOW CAN AN EFFECT WHICH EITHER IS FINITE OR FOR AUGHT WE KNOW MAY BE SO HOW CAN SUCH AN EFFECT I SAY PROVE AN INFINITE CAUSE
THE SON OF A MARTYR THE GRANDSON OF A MARTYR EXCLUDED FROM THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE IN WHICH NINE OF HIS ANCESTORS HAD SATE AS EARLS OF ARGYLE AND EXCLUDED BY A JUDGMENT ON WHICH THE WHOLE KINGDOM CRIED SHAME STILL LESS WAS IT TO BE EXPECTED
DID I SHOW YOU THE PARTICULAR CAUSES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL IN A COLLECTION OF TWENTY PARTICLES OF MATTER I SHOULD THINK IT VERY UNREASONABLE SHOULD YOU AFTERWARDS ASK ME WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE WHOLE TWENTY
LOCAL SELF GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS ECCLESIASTICAL HELPED TO TRAIN THEM FOR LOCAL SELF GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS POLITICAL THE SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE WHICH LED DISSENTERS TO REVOLT IN THE OLD WORLD
BUT THIS WORKED FOR LOCAL AUTONOMY INSTEAD OF IMPERIAL UNITY THE CLERGY BECAME A POWERFUL CLASS DOMINANT THROUGH THEIR LEARNING AND THEIR FEARFUL DENUNCIATIONS OF THE FAITHLESS THEY WROTE THE BOOKS FOR THE PEOPLE TO READ
CATHOLICS AND OTHER DENOMINATIONS BECAME TOO STRONGLY INTRENCHED AND TOO WIDELY SCATTERED TO PERMIT ANY ONE OF THEM TO RULE IF IT HAD DESIRED TO DO SO THERE WERE COMMUNITIES AND INDEED WHOLE SECTIONS WHERE ONE OR ANOTHER CHURCH PREVAILED
BUT A SKILFUL ALGEBRAIST IMMEDIATELY CONCLUDES IT TO BE THE WORK OF NECESSITY AND DEMONSTRATES THAT IT MUST FOR EVER RESULT FROM THE NATURE OF THESE NUMBERS
SCATTERED FROM MASSACHUSETTS TO GEORGIA THE ADAMSES ELLSWORTH THE MORRISES THE LIVINGSTONS HAMILTON FRANKLIN WASHINGTON MADISON MARSHALL HENRY THE RANDOLPHS AND THE PINCKNEYS
WHICH PROMISED IN TIME A SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE AND FREEDOM OF OPINION THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND VIRGINIA WAS THE STRONGHOLD OF THE ENGLISH SYSTEM OF CHURCH AND STATE
IN MOUNTING UP THEREFORE FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES WE MUST EITHER GO ON IN TRACING AN INFINITE SUCCESSION WITHOUT ANY ULTIMATE CAUSE AT ALL OR MUST AT LAST HAVE RECOURSE TO SOME ULTIMATE CAUSE THAT IS NECESSARILY EXISTENT
OF AN EXTRAORDINARY GROUP OF LEADERS FAMILIAR WITH HISTORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND THE ARTS OF WAR GOVERNMENT AND DIPLOMACY ITSELF BORE ELOQUENT TESTIMONY TO THE HIGH QUALITY OF THE AMERICAN INTELLECT NO ONE NOT EVEN THE MOST CRITICAL
IT WAS VAIN TO HOPE THAT MERE WORDS WOULD QUIET A NATION WHICH HAD NOT IN ANY AGE BEEN VERY AMENABLE TO CONTROL AND WHICH WAS NOW AGITATED BY HOPES AND RESENTMENTS SUCH AS GREAT REVOLUTIONS FOLLOWING GREAT OPPRESSIONS NATURALLY ENGENDER
AND WAS LUCKLESS ENOUGH TO HAVE A RAY OF LIGHT STRIKE HIM THROUGH A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS
OTHER PEOPLE EVEN OF GOOD SENSE AND THE BEST INCLINED TO RELIGION FEEL ALWAYS SOME DEFICIENCY IN SUCH ARGUMENTS THOUGH THEY ARE NOT PERHAPS ABLE TO EXPLAIN DISTINCTLY WHERE IT LIES
WITHIN THE CHURCH SOON AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL IN MASSACHUSETTS LIKEWISE FLUNG OFF THEIR YOKE OF UNION WITH THE ANGLICANS IN EACH TOWN A SEPARATE CONGREGATION WAS ORGANIZED THE MALE MEMBERS CHOOSING THE PASTOR THE TEACHERS AND THE OTHER OFFICERS
THOUGH NEITHER THE ANGLICANS OF VIRGINIA NOR THE PURITANS OF MASSACHUSETTS BELIEVED IN TOLERATION FOR OTHER DENOMINATIONS THAT PRINCIPLE WAS STRICTLY APPLIED IN RHODE ISLAND THERE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF ROGER WILLIAMS
THE VIOLENCE OF REVOLUTIONS IS GENERALLY PROPORTIONED TO THE DEGREE OF THE MALADMINISTRATION WHICH HAS PRODUCED THEM
WE DARE NOT AFFIRM THAT WE KNOW ALL THE QUALITIES OF MATTER AND FOR AUGHT WE CAN DETERMINE IT MAY CONTAIN SOME QUALITIES WHICH WERE THEY KNOWN WOULD MAKE ITS NON EXISTENCE APPEAR AS GREAT A CONTRADICTION AS THAT TWICE TWO IS FIVE
OF THAT CAUSE WHICH IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BUT THE WHOLE ETERNAL CHAIN OR SUCCESSION TAKEN TOGETHER IS NOT DETERMINED OR CAUSED BY ANY THING AND YET IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT REQUIRES A CAUSE OR REASON
IN NEW ENGLAND THE PURITANS WERE SUPREME NOTWITHSTANDING THE EFFORTS OF THE CROWN TO OVERBEAR THEIR AUTHORITY IN THE MIDDLE COLONIES PARTICULARLY THE MULTIPLICATION OF SECTS MADE THE DOMINANCE OF ANY SINGLE DENOMINATION IMPOSSIBLE
EXTERNAL CAUSES THERE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE NONE CHANCE IS A WORD WITHOUT A MEANING WAS IT NOTHING BUT THAT CAN NEVER PRODUCE ANY THING WE MUST THEREFORE HAVE RECOURSE TO A NECESSARILY EXISTENT BEING
AS THEY ARE ALTOGETHER UNKNOWN AND INCONCEIVABLE THEY CAN NEVER BE PROVED INCOMPATIBLE WITH IT ADD TO THIS THAT IN TRACING AN ETERNAL SUCCESSION OF OBJECTS
THE PLYMOUTH PILGRIMS HAD CAST OFF ALL ALLEGIANCE TO THE ANGLICAN CHURCH AND ESTABLISHED A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT CONGREGATION BEFORE THEY CAME TO AMERICA
AS MUCH AS ANY PARTICULAR OBJECT WHICH BEGINS TO EXIST IN TIME THE QUESTION IS STILL REASONABLE WHY THIS PARTICULAR SUCCESSION OF CAUSES EXISTED FROM ETERNITY AND NOT ANY OTHER SUCCESSION OR NO SUCCESSION AT ALL
AGAINST THE PROTESTS OF THE CATHOLICS IT WAS LIKEWISE ESTABLISHED IN MARYLAND IN NEW YORK TOO NOTWITHSTANDING THE RESISTANCE OF THE DUTCH THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH WAS FOSTERED BY THE PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS
TOLERATION ENCOURAGED DIVERSITY AND DIVERSITY IN TURN WORKED FOR GREATER TOLERATION THE GOVERNMENT AND FAITH OF THE DISSENTING DENOMINATIONS CONSPIRED WITH ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TENDENCIES TO DRAW AMERICA AWAY FROM THE ENGLISH STATE
A THOUGHTLESS MAID SERVANT WHO FOR SOME EARTHLY REASON SMILED IN CHURCH WAS IN DANGER OF BEING BANISHED AS A VAGABOND ROBERT PIKE A DEVOUT PURITAN THINKING THE SUN HAD GONE TO REST VENTURED FORTH ON HORSEBACK ONE SUNDAY EVENING
IT SEEMS TO ME SO OBVIOUSLY ILL GROUNDED AND AT THE SAME TIME OF SO LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO THE CAUSE OF TRUE PIETY AND RELIGION THAT I SHALL MYSELF VENTURE TO SHOW THE FALLACY OF IT
OF THE MASTER OF ARTS OF OXFORD WERE RESPECTED THE SENSE OF THE CONSTITUENT BODIES WAS TAKEN WITH AS LITTLE VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF MOBS WITH AS LITTLE TRICKERY ON THE PART OF RETURNING OFFICERS AS AT ANY GENERAL ELECTION OF THAT AGE
SO THE EPISCOPAL PARISH PRIESTS WERE CALLED WERE EXPELLED THE GRAVER COVENANTERS WHILE THEY APPLAUDED THE FERVOUR OF THEIR RIOTOUS BRETHREN WERE APPREHENSIVE THAT PROCEEDINGS SO IRREGULAR MIGHT GIVE SCANDAL AND LEARNED WITH ESPECIAL CONCERN
WITH PERSONS ACCUSED OF WITCHCRAFT THE PURITANS WERE STILL MORE RUTHLESS
THAT IF WE KNEW HIS WHOLE ESSENCE OR NATURE WE SHOULD PERCEIVE IT TO BE AS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO EXIST AS FOR TWICE TWO NOT TO BE FOUR BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN WHILE OUR FACULTIES REMAIN THE SAME AS AT PRESENT
PRESBYTERIANS QUAKERS BAPTISTS AND PURITANS HAD NO HIERARCHY OF BISHOPS AND ARCHBISHOPS TO BIND THEM TO THE SEAT OF POWER IN LONDON NEITHER DID THEY LOOK TO THAT METROPOLIS FOR GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING ARTICLES OF FAITH
THE UNITY TOO OF THE DIVINE NATURE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEDUCE MERELY FROM CONTEMPLATING THE WORKS OF NATURE NOR WILL THE UNIFORMITY ALONE OF THE PLAN EVEN WERE IT ALLOWED GIVE US ANY ASSURANCE OF THAT ATTRIBUTE
IT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND THE OFFICIAL CLASS SENT OUT TO THE PROVINCES ITS BISHOPS AND ARCHBISHOPS IN ENGLAND WERE APPOINTED BY THE KING AND ITS FAITH AND SERVICE WERE SET FORTH BY ACTS OF PARLIAMENT
AND SACKED THE CELLAR AND LARDER OF THE MINISTER WHICH AT THAT SEASON WERE PROBABLY BETTER STOCKED THAN USUAL
THE CLERGY OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH WERE TO USE THE PHRASE THEN COMMON RABBLED THE MORNING OF CHRISTMAS DAY WAS FIXED FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF THESE OUTRAGES FOR NOTHING DISGUSTED THE RIGID COVENANTER
THE CHURCH WAS ALSO SANCTIONED BY LAW AND SUPPORTED BY TAXES IN THE CAROLINAS AFTER SEVENTEEN O FOUR AND IN GEORGIA AFTER THAT COLONY PASSED DIRECTLY UNDER THE CROWN IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FOUR
I FIND ONLY ONE ARGUMENT EMPLOYED TO PROVE THAT THE MATERIAL WORLD IS NOT THE NECESSARILY EXISTENT BEING AND THIS ARGUMENT IS DERIVED FROM THE CONTINGENCY BOTH OF THE MATTER AND THE FORM OF THE WORLD
OF THE HOUSEHOLDER PAYING SCOT AND LOT OF THE BURGAGE TENANT
HAD ANY THING TO FEAR FROM THE FURY OF THE POPULACE
THAT THEY WOULD SUFFER THE ELECTION OF MEMBERS FOR COUNTIES AND TOWNS TO BE CONDUCTED ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE EXISTING LAW FOR UNDER THE EXISTING LAW
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING TOGETHER A CONVENTION COMMANDING THE PUBLIC RESPECT AND EXPRESSING THE PUBLIC OPINION IT WAS HARDLY TO BE EXPECTED FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE WHIGS IN THIS DAY OF THEIR POWER WOULD ENDURE TO SEE THEIR HEREDITARY LEADER
IN SUCH A CHAIN TOO OR SUCCESSION OF OBJECTS EACH PART IS CAUSED BY THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT AND CAUSES THAT WHICH SUCCEEDS IT WHERE THEN IS THE DIFFICULTY BUT THE WHOLE YOU SAY WANTS A CAUSE
WHOSE RIGHT TO SIT THERE WAS NOT CLEAR THE KNIGHTS AND BURGESSES WERE CHOSEN BY THOSE ELECTORS WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTITLED TO CHOOSE THE MEMBERS OF A HOUSE OF COMMONS CALLED UNDER THE GREAT SEAL THE FRANCHISES OF THE FORTY SHILLING FREEHOLDER
SEVERAL LORDS WHO HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR HONOURS BY SENTENCES WHICH THE GENERAL VOICE LOUDLY CONDEMNED AS UNJUST AND HE TOOK ON HIMSELF TO DISPENSE WITH THE ACT WHICH DEPRIVED PRESBYTERIANS OF THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE
FROM STARTING ANY FURTHER DIFFICULTIES YET I CANNOT FORBEAR INSISTING STILL UPON ANOTHER TOPIC IT IS OBSERVED BY ARITHMETICIANS THAT THE PRODUCTS OF NINE COMPOSE ALWAYS EITHER NINE OR SOME LESSER PRODUCT OF NINE
SUBSTITUTING FOR IT A SIMPLE PROPERTY QUALIFICATION THUS A ROYAL GOVERNOR AND AN OFFICIAL FAMILY CERTAIN TO BE EPISCOPALIAN IN FAITH AND MONARCHIST IN SYMPATHIES WERE FORCED UPON MASSACHUSETTS
WHO STILL CHERISHED MEMORIES OF BITTER RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS IN THE MOTHER COUNTRY PURITANISM IN NEW ENGLAND IF THE ESTABLISHED FAITH MADE FOR IMPERIAL UNITY THE SAME COULD NOT BE SAID OF PURITANISM
WITHOUT COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN AMERICAN COLONIAL LIFE WHICH FOSTERED MINDS OF DEPTH AND POWER WOMEN SURMOUNTED EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTIES THAN THE MEN IN THE PROCESS OF SELF EDUCATION
IN SCOTLAND DESTRUCTIVE THE ENGLISH COMPLAINED NOT OF THE LAW BUT OF THE VIOLATION OF THE LAW THEY ROSE UP AGAINST THE FIRST MAGISTRATE MERELY IN ORDER TO ASSERT THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW THEY WERE FOR THE MOST PART
THE PURITAN WHO WAS IN GENERAL BUT TOO READY TO FOLLOW PRECEDENTS AND ANALOGIES DRAWN FROM THE HISTORY AND JURISPRUDENCE OF THE JEWS MIGHT HAVE FOUND IN THE OLD TESTAMENT QUITE AS CLEAR WARRANT FOR KEEPING FESTIVALS IN HONOUR OF GREAT EVENTS
THE ANGLICAN FAITH AND WORSHIP WERE PRESCRIBED BY LAW SUSTAINED BY TAXES IMPOSED ON ALL AND FAVORED BY THE GOVERNOR THE PROVINCIAL COUNCILORS AND THE RICHEST PLANTERS THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH SAYS LODGE WAS ONE OF THE APPENDAGES OF THE VIRGINIA ARISTOCRACY
IT SEEMS ABSURD TO INQUIRE FOR A GENERAL CAUSE OR FIRST AUTHOR HOW CAN ANY THING THAT EXISTS FROM ETERNITY HAVE A CAUSE SINCE THAT RELATION IMPLIES A PRIORITY IN TIME AND A BEGINNING OF EXISTENCE
THAT HERE AND THERE AN ACHAN HAD DISGRACED THE GOOD CAUSE BY STOOPING TO PLUNDER THE CANAANITES WHOM HE OUGHT ONLY TO HAVE SMITTEN A GENERAL MEETING OF MINISTERS AND ELDERS WAS CALLED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PREVENTING SUCH DISCREDITABLE EXCESSES
EIGHTEEN PEOPLE WERE HANGED ONE WAS PRESSED TO DEATH MANY SUFFERED IMPRISONMENT AND TWO DIED IN JAIL JUST ABOUT THIS TIME HOWEVER THERE CAME A BREAK IN THE UNIFORMITY OF PURITAN RULE
THEY ALSO COMPOSED THE VOTERS IN THE TOWN MEETING WHERE SECULAR MATTERS WERE DETERMINED THE UNION OF CHURCH AND GOVERNMENT WAS THUS COMPLETE AND UNIFORMITY OF FAITH AND LIFE PRESCRIBED BY LAW AND ENFORCED BY CIVIL AUTHORITIES
THAN THERE IS IN THAT SUCCESSION OF CAUSES WHICH CONSTITUTES THE UNIVERSE WHAT WAS IT THEN WHICH DETERMINED SOMETHING TO EXIST RATHER THAN NOTHING AND BESTOWED BEING ON A PARTICULAR POSSIBILITY EXCLUSIVE OF THE REST
IT MUST BE SOME UNKNOWN INCONCEIVABLE QUALITIES WHICH CAN MAKE HIS NON EXISTENCE APPEAR IMPOSSIBLE OR HIS ATTRIBUTES UNALTERABLE AND NO REASON CAN BE ASSIGNED WHY THESE QUALITIES MAY NOT BELONG TO MATTER
WHO CARRIES THE REASON OF HIS EXISTENCE IN HIMSELF AND WHO CANNOT BE SUPPOSED NOT TO EXIST WITHOUT AN EXPRESS CONTRADICTION THERE IS CONSEQUENTLY SUCH A BEING THAT IS THERE IS A DEITY
IN THIS MEETING IT WAS DETERMINED THAT FOR THE FUTURE THE EJECTION OF THE ESTABLISHED CLERGY
THERE WERE ABUNDANT REASONS FOR THIS IN MANY OF THE COLONIES MARYLAND PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW ENGLAND THE RELIGIOUS IMPULSE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE IMPELLING MOTIVES IN STIMULATING IMMIGRATION IN ALL THE COLONIES
NOTHING THAT IS DISTINCTLY CONCEIVABLE IMPLIES A CONTRADICTION WHATEVER WE CONCEIVE AS EXISTENT WE CAN ALSO CONCEIVE AS NON EXISTENT THERE IS NO BEING THEREFORE WHOSE NON EXISTENCE IMPLIES A CONTRADICTION
LIKE THE UNITING OF SEVERAL DISTINCT COUNTRIES INTO ONE KINGDOM OR SEVERAL DISTINCT MEMBERS INTO ONE BODY IS PERFORMED MERELY BY AN ARBITRARY ACT OF THE MIND AND HAS NO INFLUENCE ON THE NATURE OF THINGS
IN THE SAME MANNER AS WE LIE UNDER A NECESSITY OF ALWAYS CONCEIVING TWICE TWO TO BE FOUR
BUT THIS PROCLAMATION NOT BEING SUPPORTED BY TROOPS WAS VERY LITTLE REGARDED ON THE VERY DAY AFTER IT WAS PUBLISHED AT GLASGOW THE VENERABLE CATHEDRAL OF THAT CITY ALMOST THE ONLY FINE CHURCH OF THE MIDDLE AGES WHICH STANDS UNINJURED IN SCOTLAND
AND THE ANGLICANS EMBRACING ABOUT ONE FIFTEENTH OF THE POPULATION EXERTED AN INFLUENCE ALL OUT OF PROPORTION TO THEIR NUMBERS MANY FACTORS HELPED TO ENHANCE THE POWER OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH IN THE COLONIES
THOUGH I KNOW THAT THE STARTING OBJECTIONS IS HIS CHIEF DELIGHT
THE CLERGY AT LEAST IN THE BEGINNING FORMED THE ONLY CLASS WITH ANY LEISURE TO DEVOTE TO MATTERS OF THE SPIRIT THEY PREACHED ON SUNDAYS AND TAUGHT SCHOOL ON WEEK DAYS THEY LED IN THE DISCUSSION OF LOCAL PROBLEMS AND IN THE FORMATION OF POLITICAL OPINION
A NEW DOCUMENT ISSUED SEVEN YEARS LATER WRESTED FROM THE PURITANS OF THE COLONY THE RIGHT TO ELECT THEIR OWN GOVERNOR AND RESERVED THE POWER OF APPOINTMENT TO THE KING IT ALSO ABOLISHED THE RULE LIMITING THE SUFFRAGE TO CHURCH MEMBERS
AS IF THOSE ADVANTAGES AND CONVENIENCES IN THE ABSTRACT ARGUMENT WERE FULL PROOFS OF ITS SOLIDITY BUT IT IS FIRST PROPER IN MY OPINION TO DETERMINE WHAT ARGUMENT OF THIS NATURE YOU CHOOSE TO INSIST ON
SO DANGEROUS IS IT TO INTRODUCE THIS IDEA OF NECESSITY INTO THE PRESENT QUESTION AND SO NATURALLY DOES IT AFFORD AN INFERENCE DIRECTLY OPPOSITE TO THE RELIGIOUS HYPOTHESIS
THE CHURCH ESTABLISHED BY LAW WAS THE MOST ODIOUS INSTITUTION IN THE REALM THE TRIBUNALS HAD PRONOUNCED SOME SENTENCES SO FLAGITIOUS THE PARLIAMENT HAD PASSED SOME ACTS SO OPPRESSIVE THAT UNLESS THOSE SENTENCES AND THOSE ACTS WERE TREATED AS NULLITIES
IF THERE BE NO NECESSARILY EXISTENT BEING ANY SUPPOSITION WHICH CAN BE FORMED IS EQUALLY POSSIBLE NOR IS THERE ANY MORE ABSURDITY IN NOTHING'S HAVING EXISTED FROM ETERNITY
TAKEN ON HIMSELF PROVISIONALLY THE EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF THAT KINGDOM THE MEANS OF MAINTAINING ORDER THERE WERE NOT AT HIS COMMAND HE HAD NOT A SINGLE REGIMENT NORTH OF THE TWEED OR INDEED WITHIN MANY MILES OF THAT RIVER
AND MEMBERS OF ALL RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS IF THEY HAD THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF PROPERTY WERE PERMITTED TO TAKE PART IN ELECTIONS BY THIS ACT IN THE NAME OF THE CROWN THE PURITAN MONOPOLY WAS BROKEN DOWN IN MASSACHUSETTS
AND THE PATRIOT NEWSPAPERS FOUNDED AND MANAGED BY WOMEN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES IN THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF AMERICA THE CHURCHES ASSUMED A ROLE OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
HIS GOWN WAS TORN TO SHREDS OVER HIS HEAD IF HE HAD A PRAYER BOOK IN HIS POCKET IT WAS BURNED AND HE WAS DISMISSED WITH A CHARGE NEVER AS HE VALUED HIS LIFE
A PROCLAMATION WAS HOWEVER PUT FORTH DIRECTING THAT ALL PEOPLE SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND THAT TILL THE CONVENTION SHOULD HAVE SETTLED THE GOVERNMENT THE CLERGY OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH SHOULD BE SUFFERED TO RESIDE ON THEIR CURES WITHOUT MOLESTATION
AND WE SHALL AFTERWARDS FROM ITSELF BETTER THAN FROM ITS USEFUL CONSEQUENCES ENDEAVOUR TO DETERMINE WHAT VALUE WE OUGHT TO PUT UPON IT
LIBERTY IN MATTERS OF CONSCIENCE WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE BEGINNING MARYLAND BY GRANTING IN SIXTEEN FORTY NINE FREEDOM TO THOSE WHO PROFESSED TO BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST OPENED ITS GATES TO ALL CHRISTIANS AND PENNSYLVANIA TRUE TO THE TENETS OF THE FRIENDS
IF YOU ADD TOGETHER ALL THE CHARACTERS OF WHICH ANY OF THE FORMER PRODUCTS IS COMPOSED THUS OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY SIX WHICH ARE PRODUCTS OF NINE YOU MAKE NINE BY ADDING ONE TO EIGHT TWO TO SEVEN THREE TO SIX
HAVE NO MEANING OR WHICH IS THE SAME THING NONE THAT IS CONSISTENT BUT FURTHER WHY MAY NOT THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE BE THE NECESSARILY EXISTENT BEING ACCORDING TO THIS PRETENDED EXPLICATION OF NECESSITY
AND ANY FORM MAY BE CONCEIVED TO BE ALTERED SUCH AN ANNIHILATION OR ALTERATION THEREFORE IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE
AND THEIR KEEN INTEREST IN PUBLIC ISSUES IS EVIDENT IN MANY A RECORD LIKE THE LETTERS OF MISSUS JOHN ADAMS TO HER HUSBAND DURING THE REVOLUTION THE WRITINGS OF MISSUS MERCY OTIS WARREN THE SISTER OF JAMES OTIS WHO MEASURED HER PEN WITH THE BRITISH PROPAGANDISTS
A DAY OF REST THAT BEGAN AT SIX O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY EVENING AND LASTED UNTIL SUNSET ON SUNDAY ALL WORK ALL TRADING ALL AMUSEMENT AND ALL WORLDLY CONVERSATION WERE ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED DURING THOSE HOURS
CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS NO BEING WHOSE EXISTENCE IS DEMONSTRABLE I PROPOSE THIS ARGUMENT AS ENTIRELY DECISIVE AND AM WILLING TO REST THE WHOLE CONTROVERSY UPON IT IT IS PRETENDED THAT THE DEITY IS A NECESSARILY EXISTENT BEING
HAVING ITS SEAT OF POWER IN THE ENGLISH MONARCHY IT COULD HOLD ITS CLERGY AND MISSIONARIES LOYAL TO THE CROWN AND SO COUNTERACT TO SOME EXTENT THE INDEPENDENT SPIRIT THAT WAS GROWING UP IN AMERICA THE CHURCH ALWAYS A STRONG BULWARK OF THE STATE
IT WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE FOR US AT ANY TIME TO CONCEIVE THE NON EXISTENCE OF WHAT WE FORMERLY CONCEIVED TO EXIST NOR CAN THE MIND EVER LIE UNDER A NECESSITY OF SUPPOSING ANY OBJECT TO REMAIN ALWAYS IN BEING
AND IF YOU ADD THREE SIX AND NINE YOU MAKE EIGHTEEN A LESSER PRODUCT OF NINE TO A SUPERFICIAL OBSERVER SO WONDERFUL A REGULARITY MAY BE ADMIRED AS THE EFFECT EITHER OF CHANCE OR DESIGN
SOMETIMES BEATEN SOMETIMES DUCKED HIS FURNITURE WAS THROWN OUT OF THE WINDOWS HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN TURNED OUT OF DOORS IN THE SNOW HE WAS THEN CARRIED TO THE MARKET PLACE AND EXPOSED DURING SOME TIME AS A MALEFACTOR
IS IT NOT PROBABLE I ASK THAT THE WHOLE ECONOMY OF THE UNIVERSE IS CONDUCTED BY A LIKE NECESSITY THOUGH NO HUMAN ALGEBRA CAN FURNISH A KEY WHICH SOLVES THE DIFFICULTY AND INSTEAD OF ADMIRING THE ORDER OF NATURAL BEINGS
MAY IT NOT HAPPEN THAT COULD WE PENETRATE INTO THE INTIMATE NATURE OF BODIES WE SHOULD CLEARLY SEE WHY IT WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE THEY COULD EVER ADMIT OF ANY OTHER DISPOSITION
GAVE FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE TO THOSE
WHO NEVER MAKES A MISTAKE A NUN WAS A CREATURE WHO NEVER SINS THEY WERE SOULS WALLED IN FROM THIS WORLD WITH A SINGLE DOOR WHICH NEVER OPENED EXCEPT TO ALLOW THE TRUTH TO PASS THROUGH ON PERCEIVING THE SISTER
BEFORE GOING TO THE GALLEYS I WAS A POOR PEASANT WITH VERY LITTLE INTELLIGENCE A SORT OF IDIOT THE GALLEYS WROUGHT A CHANGE IN ME I WAS STUPID I BECAME VICIOUS I WAS A BLOCK OF WOOD I BECAME A FIREBRAND
WHICH IS KILLED BY THE MOTHER BECAUSE OTHERWISE AS HE GREW UP HE WOULD DEVOUR THE OTHER LITTLE ONES GIVE TO THIS DOG SON OF A WOLF A HUMAN FACE AND THE RESULT WILL BE JAVERT JAVERT HAD BEEN BORN IN PRISON OF A FORTUNE TELLER
HIS MOUTH PURSED UP AND TERRIBLE HIS AIR THAT OF FEROCIOUS COMMAND THIS MAN WAS COMPOSED OF TWO VERY SIMPLE AND TWO VERY GOOD SENTIMENTS COMPARATIVELY BUT HE RENDERED THEM ALMOST BAD BY DINT OF EXAGGERATING THEM
AND THIS FURNISHES THE NECESSARY CORRECTIVE FOR THE TOO ABSOLUTE SENSE WHICH CERTAIN WORDS MIGHT PRESENT THERE CAN BE NOTHING REALLY INFALLIBLE IN A HUMAN CREATURE AND THE PECULIARITY OF INSTINCT IS THAT IT CAN BECOME CONFUSED THROWN OFF THE TRACK AND DEFEATED
WITH FOLDED ARMS AND A SLOW SHAKE OF THE HEAD AND HIS UPPER LIP RAISED IN COMPANY WITH HIS LOWER TO HIS NOSE A SORT OF SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE WHICH MIGHT BE TRANSLATED BY WHAT IS THAT MAN AFTER ALL
JEAN VALJEAN HAD JUST FINISHED WRITING A FEW LINES ON A PAPER WHICH HE HANDED TO THE NUN SAYING SISTER
ALL EYES WERE FOCUSED ON HIM AND ON HIS BARE ARM A GENDARME HELD A LIGHT CLOSE TO IT THERE WAS THE DATE
ONLY THREE OR FOUR PERSONS IN ALL THE TOWN REMAINED FAITHFUL TO HIS MEMORY THE OLD PORTRESS WHO HAD SERVED HIM WAS AMONG THE NUMBER ON THE EVENING OF THAT DAY THE WORTHY OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING IN HER LODGE
CHENILDIEU YOU WHO CONFERRED ON YOURSELF THE NAME OF JENIE DIEU YOUR WHOLE RIGHT SHOULDER BEARS A DEEP BURN BECAUSE YOU ONE DAY LAID YOUR SHOULDER AGAINST THE CHAFING DISH FULL OF COALS IN ORDER TO EFFACE THE THREE LETTERS T F P
THE FORTY SOU PIECE WHICH I STOLE SEVEN YEARS AGO FROM LITTLE GERVAIS I HAVE NOTHING FARTHER TO ADD TAKE ME GOOD GOD THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SHAKES HIS HEAD
NOR ALL THE EVENING AND THAT I HAVE NOT EVEN LEFT THE DOOR A MAN RESPONDED
THEN PREFECT OF POLICE AT PARIS
COCHEPAILLE WHO WAS INTIMIDATED MADE A MILITARY SALUTE
HIS FIRST MOVEMENT WAS TO RETIRE BUT THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER DUTY WHICH BOUND HIM AND IMPELLED HIM IMPERIOUSLY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION HIS SECOND MOVEMENT WAS TO REMAIN AND TO VENTURE ON AT LEAST ONE QUESTION
GOD KNOWS WHERE TO FIND THE SOUL AGAIN FANTINE WAS LAID IN THE SHADE AMONG THE FIRST BONES THAT CAME TO HAND SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO THE PROMISCUOUSNESS OF ASHES SHE WAS THROWN INTO THE PUBLIC GRAVE
CHAPTER FIVE VAGUE FLASHES ON THE HORIZON LITTLE BY LITTLE AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME ALL THIS OPPOSITION SUBSIDED
IN THE STRIPS OF LINEN THUS PREPARED HE WRAPPED THE TWO SILVER CANDLESTICKS HE BETRAYED NEITHER HASTE NOR AGITATION AND WHILE HE WAS WRAPPING UP THE BISHOP'S CANDLESTICKS HE NIBBLED AT A PIECE OF BLACK BREAD
AND THE FORTY SOU PIECE WHICH HAD BEEN BLACKENED BY THE FIRE HE TOOK A SHEET OF PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE THESE ARE THE TWO TIPS OF MY IRON SHOD CUDGEL AND THE FORTY SOU PIECE STOLEN FROM LITTLE GERVAIS
COULD HAVE EXPLAINED WHAT HE FELT NO ONE PROBABLY SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS WITNESSING THE SPLENDID OUTBURST OF A GRAND LIGHT ALL FELT THEMSELVES INWARDLY DAZZLED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY HAD JEAN VALJEAN BEFORE THEIR EYES
ALL THE ANTERIOR TRACES WHICH FATHER MADELEINE MIGHT HAVE LEFT ELSEWHERE HE SEEMED TO KNOW AND HE SOMETIMES SAID IN COVERT WORDS THAT SOME ONE HAD GLEANED CERTAIN INFORMATION IN A CERTAIN DISTRICT ABOUT A FAMILY WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED
ONCE HE CHANCED TO SAY AS HE WAS TALKING TO HIMSELF I THINK I HAVE HIM THEN HE REMAINED PENSIVE FOR THREE DAYS AND UTTERED NOT A WORD IT SEEMED THAT THE THREAD WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HELD HAD BROKEN MOREOVER
THE EARTH FANTINE WAS GIVEN BACK TO THAT MOTHER
HE FULLY SHARED THE OPINION OF THOSE EXTREME MINDS WHICH ATTRIBUTE TO HUMAN LAW I KNOW NOT WHAT POWER OF MAKING OR IF THE READER WILL HAVE IT SO OF AUTHENTICATING DEMONS AND WHO PLACE A STYX AT THE BASE OF SOCIETY
THAT WAS CLEAR THE APPEARANCE OF THIS MAN HAD SUFFICED TO SUFFUSE WITH LIGHT THAT MATTER WHICH HAD BEEN SO OBSCURE BUT A MOMENT PREVIOUSLY WITHOUT ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION THE WHOLE CROWD AS BY A SORT OF ELECTRIC REVELATION
THE VERY STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED INCIDENT WHICH DISTURBS THE AUDIENCE INSPIRES US LIKE YOURSELVES ONLY WITH A SENTIMENT WHICH IT IS UNNECESSARY FOR US TO EXPRESS
JAVERT CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE NUN AND HALTED IN AMAZEMENT IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT IN JAVERT HIS ELEMENT THE VERY AIR HE BREATHED WAS VENERATION FOR ALL AUTHORITY THIS WAS IMPREGNABLE
AT THAT MOMENT THE SMALL WINDOW IN THE LODGE OPENED A HAND PASSED THROUGH SEIZED THE KEY AND THE CANDLESTICK AND LIGHTED THE TAPER AT THE CANDLE WHICH WAS BURNING THERE THE PORTRESS RAISED HER EYES
THIS INDECISION ONLY LASTED A FEW SECONDS EVEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENT AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY COULD UTTER A WORD BEFORE THE USHERS AND THE GENDARMES COULD MAKE A GESTURE
THEY RECOGNIZED JAVERT'S VOICE THE CHAMBER WAS SO ARRANGED THAT THE DOOR IN OPENING MASKED THE CORNER OF THE WALL ON THE RIGHT JEAN VALJEAN BLEW OUT THE LIGHT AND PLACED HIMSELF IN THIS ANGLE SISTER SIMPLICE FELL ON HER KNEES NEAR THE TABLE
IT WAS A STRIKING CIRCUMSTANCE THAT NO QUESTION WAS PUT THAT NO AUTHORITY INTERVENED THE PECULIARITY OF SUBLIME SPECTACLES IS THAT THEY CAPTURE ALL SOULS AND TURN WITNESSES INTO SPECTATORS NO ONE PROBABLY
RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY HATRED OF REBELLION AND IN HIS EYES MURDER ROBBERY ALL CRIMES ARE ONLY FORMS OF REBELLION HE ENVELOPED IN A BLIND AND PROFOUND FAITH EVERY ONE WHO HAD A FUNCTION IN THE STATE
THE UNHAPPY MAN TURNED TO THE SPECTATORS AND THE JUDGES WITH A SMILE WHICH STILL RENDS THE HEARTS OF ALL WHO SAW IT WHENEVER THEY THINK OF IT IT WAS A SMILE OF TRIUMPH
I AM PURSUED IT WOULD ONLY END IN THEIR ARRESTING ME IN THAT ROOM AND THAT WOULD DISTURB HER HE HAD HARDLY FINISHED WHEN A LOUD NOISE BECAME AUDIBLE ON THE STAIRCASE THEY HEARD A TUMULT OF ASCENDING FOOTSTEPS
AND AS THEY NOW RING IN THE EARS OF THOSE WHO HEARD THEM NEARLY FORTY YEARS AGO I THANK YOU MISTER DISTRICT ATTORNEY BUT I AM NOT MAD YOU SHALL SEE YOU WERE ON THE POINT OF COMMITTING A GREAT ERROR RELEASE THIS MAN
THAT AT THE SINGLE WORD HE WAS A CONVICT NEARLY EVERY ONE DESERTED HIM IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS ALL THE GOOD THAT HE HAD DONE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN AND HE WAS NOTHING BUT A CONVICT FROM THE GALLEYS
THE MAN WHO STOOD THERE APPEARED SO CALM THAT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND AT FIRST THEY ASKED THEMSELVES WHETHER HE HAD INDEED UTTERED THAT CRY THEY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT TRANQUIL MAN HAD BEEN THE ONE TO GIVE THAT TERRIBLE OUTCRY
IN THE MEANTIME THE FACE OF THE PRESIDENT WAS STAMPED WITH SYMPATHY AND SADNESS HE HAD EXCHANGED A RAPID SIGN WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND A FEW LOW TONED WORDS WITH THE ASSISTANT JUDGES HE ADDRESSED THE PUBLIC
NOTHING CAN REPRODUCE THE SOMBRE AND KINDLY MELANCHOLY OF TONE WHICH ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS HE TURNED TO THE THREE CONVICTS AND SAID WELL I RECOGNIZE YOU DO YOU REMEMBER BREVET HE PAUSED
NO ONE RECALLED ANY LONGER THE PART THAT EACH MIGHT BE CALLED UPON TO PLAY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FORGOT HE WAS THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROSECUTING THE PRESIDENT THAT HE WAS THERE TO PRESIDE THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE THAT HE WAS THERE TO DEFEND
A TERRIBLE MOMENT ENSUED DURING WHICH THE POOR PORTRESS FELT AS THOUGH SHE SHOULD FAINT THE SISTER RAISED HER EYES AND ANSWERED YES THEN RESUMED JAVERT YOU WILL EXCUSE ME IF I PERSIST IT IS MY DUTY
IN SHORT THERE ARE MANY THINGS WHICH I CANNOT TELL I WILL NOT NARRATE THE STORY OF MY LIFE TO YOU YOU WILL HEAR IT ONE OF THESE DAYS I ROBBED MONSEIGNEUR THE BISHOP IT IS TRUE IT IS TRUE THAT I ROBBED LITTLE GERVAIS
A FEROCIOUS HONESTY A MARBLE INFORMER BRUTUS IN VIDOCQ JAVERT'S WHOLE PERSON WAS EXPRESSIVE OF THE MAN WHO SPIES AND WHO WITHDRAWS HIMSELF FROM OBSERVATION
UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY AND AT A SINGLE GLANCE THE SIMPLE AND MAGNIFICENT HISTORY OF A MAN WHO WAS DELIVERING HIMSELF UP SO THAT ANOTHER MAN MIGHT NOT BE CONDEMNED IN HIS STEAD THE DETAILS THE HESITATIONS LITTLE POSSIBLE OPPOSITIONS
YES REALLY HIS NAME WAS NOT MADELEINE AT ALL HE HAD A FRIGHTFUL NAME BEJEAN BOJEAN BOUJEAN AH GOOD GOD HE HAS BEEN ARRESTED ARRESTED IN PRISON IN THE CITY PRISON
THE DOOR OPENED JAVERT ENTERED THE WHISPERS OF MANY MEN AND THE PROTESTATIONS OF THE PORTRESS WERE AUDIBLE IN THE CORRIDOR THE NUN DID NOT RAISE HER EYES SHE WAS PRAYING THE CANDLE WAS ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE
I CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN HIM SOMEWHERE IN ANY CASE I AM NOT HIS DUPE THIS PERSON GRAVE WITH A GRAVITY WHICH WAS ALMOST MENACING WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO
AND ADMITTED OF NEITHER OBJECTION NOR RESTRICTION IN HIS EYES OF COURSE THE ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITY WAS THE CHIEF OF ALL HE WAS RELIGIOUS SUPERFICIAL AND CORRECT ON THIS POINT AS ON ALL OTHERS IN HIS EYES A PRIEST WAS A MIND
NOR ANY ADVICE TO GIVE TO SOCIETY BUT YOU SEE THE INFAMY FROM WHICH I HAVE TRIED TO ESCAPE IS AN INJURIOUS THING THE GALLEYS MAKE THE CONVICT WHAT HE IS REFLECT UPON THAT IF YOU PLEASE
IN PRISON SAID HE I WAS THERE I BROKE A BAR OF ONE OF THE WINDOWS I LET MYSELF DROP FROM THE TOP OF A ROOF AND HERE I AM I AM GOING UP TO MY ROOM GO AND FIND SISTER SIMPLICE FOR ME
WHICH IN THE COURSE OF SIX OR SEVEN YEARS GRADUALLY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE DISTRICT ONE SINGLE MAN IN THE TOWN IN THE ARRONDISSEMENT ABSOLUTELY ESCAPED THIS CONTAGION AND WHATEVER FATHER MADELEINE DID
HAVING MADE THIS RESERVATION LET US PASS ON NOW IF THE READER WILL ADMIT FOR A MOMENT WITH US THAT IN EVERY MAN THERE IS ONE OF THE ANIMAL SPECIES OF CREATION
AND HE DESPAIRED OF EVER RE ENTERING IT HE OBSERVED THAT SOCIETY UNPARDONINGLY EXCLUDES TWO CLASSES OF MEN THOSE WHO ATTACK IT AND THOSE WHO GUARD IT HE HAD NO CHOICE EXCEPT BETWEEN THESE TWO CLASSES
THAT MAN WAS JEAN VALJEAN IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE TESTIMONY OF TWO OR THREE CARTERS WHO MET HIM THAT HE WAS CARRYING A BUNDLE THAT HE WAS DRESSED IN A BLOUSE WHERE HAD HE OBTAINED THAT BLOUSE NO ONE EVER FOUND OUT
HE INTERRUPTED HIM IN ACCENTS FULL OF SUAVITY AND AUTHORITY THESE ARE THE WORDS WHICH HE UTTERED HERE THEY ARE LITERALLY AS THEY WERE WRITTEN DOWN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TRIAL BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES TO THIS SCENE
AND TOWARDS EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE THE MOMENT ARRIVED WHEN THE WORD MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
IT WAS NEVER KNOWN WHO OPENED THE DOOR BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE FOUND THE DOOR OPEN WHEN HE REACHED IT ON ARRIVING THERE HE TURNED ROUND AND SAID I AM AT YOUR COMMAND MISTER DISTRICT ATTORNEY THEN HE ADDRESSED THE AUDIENCE ALL OF YOU
AND THE MAN FOX OF THE PRESENCE OF THE MAN LION
LATER ON INDULGENCE AND KINDNESS SAVED ME AS SEVERITY HAD RUINED ME BUT PARDON ME YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING YOU WILL FIND AT MY HOUSE AMONG THE ASHES IN THE FIREPLACE
EVEN WHEN ONLY SEEN BY A RAPID GLIMPSE ARREST THE SPECTATOR'S ATTENTION HIS NAME WAS JAVERT AND HE BELONGED TO THE POLICE
THEY WERE RIGHT IN TELLING YOU THAT JEAN VALJEAN WAS A VERY VICIOUS WRETCH PERHAPS IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER HIS FAULT LISTEN HONORABLE JUDGES A MAN WHO HAS BEEN SO GREATLY HUMBLED AS I HAVE HAS NEITHER ANY REMONSTRANCES TO MAKE TO PROVIDENCE
NO ONE EVER FOUND OUT HOW HE HAD MANAGED TO GET INTO THE COURTYARD WITHOUT OPENING THE BIG GATES HE HAD AND ALWAYS CARRIED ABOUT HIM A PASS KEY WHICH OPENED A LITTLE SIDE DOOR BUT HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEARCHED AND HIS LATCH KEY MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM
AND THE OLD PORTRESS SAYING IN HER LOUDEST AND MOST PIERCING TONES MY GOOD SIR
REMAINED HIS OPPONENT AS THOUGH A SORT OF INCORRUPTIBLE AND IMPERTURBABLE INSTINCT KEPT HIM ON THE ALERT AND UNEASY IT SEEMS IN FACT
THOUGH PURE AND UPRIGHT LIKE ALL INSTINCTS WHICH CREATES ANTIPATHIES AND SYMPATHIES WHICH FATALLY SEPARATES ONE NATURE FROM ANOTHER NATURE WHICH DOES NOT HESITATE WHICH FEELS NO DISQUIET
I AM FULFILLING A DUTY I AM THAT MISERABLE CRIMINAL I AM THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO SEES THE MATTER CLEARLY AND I AM TELLING YOU THE TRUTH GOD WHO IS ON HIGH LOOKS DOWN ON WHAT I AM DOING AT THIS MOMENT AND THAT SUFFICES
FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE RURAL POLICEMAN HE COVERED WITH SCORN AVERSION AND DISGUST EVERY ONE WHO HAD ONCE CROSSED THE LEGAL THRESHOLD OF EVIL HE WAS ABSOLUTE AND ADMITTED NO EXCEPTIONS ON THE ONE HAND HE SAID
CALM AFFECTIONATE SURROUNDED BY THE BLESSINGS OF ALL A MAN OF LOFTY STATURE CLAD IN AN IRON GRAY FROCK COAT ARMED WITH A HEAVY CANE AND WEARING A BATTERED HAT TURNED ROUND ABRUPTLY BEHIND HIM AND FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES UNTIL HE DISAPPEARED
THE FORTUNE OF THE GREAT MANUFACTURER WAS ALREADY MADE AND FATHER MADELEINE HAD BECOME MONSIEUR MADELEINE CERTAIN POLICE OFFICERS HAVE A PECULIAR PHYSIOGNOMY WHICH IS COMPLICATED WITH AN AIR OF BASENESS MINGLED WITH AN AIR OF AUTHORITY
THIS CAUSED HIM TO BE NOT WHOLLY ILLITERATE THIS COULD BE RECOGNIZED BY SOME EMPHASIS IN HIS SPEECH AS WE HAVE SAID HE HAD NO VICES WHEN HE WAS PLEASED WITH HIMSELF HE PERMITTED HIMSELF A PINCH OF SNUFF
THE FUNCTIONARY CAN MAKE NO MISTAKE THE MAGISTRATE IS NEVER THE WRONG ON THE OTHER HAND HE SAID THESE MEN ARE IRREMEDIABLY LOST NOTHING GOOD CAN COME FROM THEM
THIS POINT WAS NEVER EXPLAINED HE ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE LEADING TO HIS CHAMBER ON ARRIVING AT THE TOP HE LEFT HIS CANDLE ON THE TOP STEP OF HIS STAIRS OPENED HIS DOOR WITH VERY LITTLE NOISE WENT AND CLOSED HIS WINDOW AND HIS SHUTTERS BY FEELING
YOU SEE PLAINLY HE SAID THAT I AM JEAN VALJEAN IN THAT CHAMBER THERE WERE NO LONGER EITHER JUDGES ACCUSERS NOR GENDARMES THERE WAS NOTHING BUT STARING EYES AND SYMPATHIZING HEARTS
SO DECISIVE A THING THAT HE DID NOT EVEN OBSERVE THE SINGULARITY OF THAT CANDLE WHICH HAD BUT JUST BEEN EXTINGUISHED AND WHICH WAS STILL SMOKING ON THE TABLE AN HOUR LATER A MAN MARCHING AMID TREES AND MISTS
SHE CRIED AT LAST I THOUGHT YOU WERE SHE STOPPED THE CONCLUSION OF HER SENTENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN LACKING IN RESPECT TOWARDS THE BEGINNING JEAN VALJEAN WAS STILL MONSIEUR LE MAIRE TO HER HE FINISHED HER THOUGHT
WHILE WAITING TO BE TRANSFERRED UNTIL HE IS TRANSFERRED HE IS TO BE TRANSFERRED WHERE IS HE TO BE TAKEN HE WILL BE TRIED AT THE ASSIZES FOR A HIGHWAY ROBBERY WHICH HE COMMITTED LONG AGO WELL I SUSPECTED AS MUCH
HE WAS STOICAL SERIOUS AUSTERE A MELANCHOLY DREAMER HUMBLE AND HAUGHTY LIKE FANATICS HIS GLANCE WAS LIKE A GIMLET COLD AND PIERCING HIS WHOLE LIFE HUNG ON THESE TWO WORDS WATCHFULNESS
TO STAMMER A FEW INARTICULATE SOUNDS SHE SUCCEEDED IN SAYING HOWEVER DOES NOT MONSIEUR LE MAIRE DESIRE TO TAKE A LAST LOOK AT THAT POOR UNHAPPY WOMAN NO SAID HE
AN EYE FULL OF SUSPICION AND CONJECTURE
THIS WAS SISTER SIMPLICE WHO HAD NEVER TOLD A LIE IN HER LIFE JAVERT KNEW IT AND HELD HER IN SPECIAL VENERATION IN CONSEQUENCE SISTER SAID HE ARE YOU ALONE IN THIS ROOM
MADE THE FOLLOWING REMARK THE DEPTH OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FATHOM I AM NOT SORRY IT WILL BE A LESSON TO THE BONAPARTISTS
I SHALL WITHDRAW SINCE YOU DO NOT ARREST ME I HAVE MANY THINGS TO DO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY KNOWS WHO I AM HE KNOWS WHITHER I AM GOING HE CAN HAVE ME ARRESTED WHEN HE LIKES HE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE DOOR
THE PAPER WAS NOT FOLDED SHE CAST A GLANCE UPON IT YOU CAN READ IT SAID HE SHE READ
ONE DAY NEVERTHELESS
HE WILL BE SO GOOD AS TO PAY OUT OF IT THE EXPENSES OF MY TRIAL AND OF THE FUNERAL OF THE WOMAN WHO DIED YESTERDAY THE REST IS FOR THE POOR THE SISTER TRIED TO SPEAK BUT SHE ONLY MANAGED
HIS HANDS WERE NOT VISIBLE THEY WERE DRAWN UP IN HIS SLEEVES AND HIS CANE WAS NOT VISIBLE HE CARRIED IT UNDER HIS COAT BUT WHEN THE OCCASION PRESENTED ITSELF THERE WAS SUDDENLY SEEN TO EMERGE FROM ALL THIS SHADOW AS FROM AN AMBUSCADE
THAT MAN WAS TOO GOOD TOO PERFECT TOO AFFECTED HE REFUSED THE CROSS HE BESTOWED SOUS ON ALL THE LITTLE SCAMPS HE CAME ACROSS
HAD ADVANCED TOWARDS THE WITNESSES COCHEPAILLE BREVET AND CHENILDIEU DO YOU NOT RECOGNIZE ME SAID HE ALL THREE REMAINED SPEECHLESS AND INDICATED BY A SIGN OF THE HEAD THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW HIM
YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME THAT IS DISTRESSING DO NOT AT LEAST CONDEMN THIS MAN WHAT THESE MEN DO NOT RECOGNIZE ME I WISH JAVERT WERE HERE HE WOULD RECOGNIZE ME
WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO DECLARE THAT JAVERT WAS A SYMBOL HIS BROW WAS NOT VISIBLE IT DISAPPEARED BENEATH HIS HAT HIS EYES WERE NOT VISIBLE SINCE THEY WERE LOST UNDER HIS EYEBROWS HIS CHIN WAS NOT VISIBLE
EVIL HISTORY BACK OF ALL THAT THE DRAWING ROOMS PARTICULARLY ABOUNDED IN REMARKS OF THIS NATURE ONE OLD LADY A SUBSCRIBER TO THE DRAPEAU BLANC
BUT AN AGED WORKMAN HAD DIED IN THE INFIRMARY OF THE FACTORY A FEW DAYS BEFORE LEAVING BEHIND HIM NOTHING BUT HIS BLOUSE PERHAPS THAT WAS THE ONE ONE LAST WORD ABOUT FANTINE WE ALL HAVE A MOTHER
INFALLIBLE IMPERIOUS INTRACTABLE STUBBORN TO ALL COUNSELS OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND TO ALL THE DISSOLVENTS OF REASON AND WHICH IN WHATEVER MANNER DESTINIES ARE ARRANGED SECRETLY WARNS THE MAN DOG OF THE PRESENCE OF THE MAN CAT
THAT IS TO SAY THE POSSIBILITY OF EDUCATION SOCIAL EDUCATION WHEN WELL DONE CAN ALWAYS DRAW FROM A SOUL OF WHATEVER SORT IT MAY BE THE UTILITY WHICH IT CONTAINS THIS BE IT SAID
HE PUT AN END TO DIFFERENCES HE PREVENTED LAWSUITS HE RECONCILED ENEMIES EVERY ONE TOOK HIM FOR THE JUDGE AND WITH GOOD REASON IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE HAD FOR A SOUL THE BOOK OF THE NATURAL LAW IT WAS LIKE AN EPIDEMIC OF VENERATION
IT WAS SEVERAL SECONDS BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK SHE HAD A SEIZURE AS SHE SAID HERSELF WHEN SHE RELATED THE ADVENTURE AFTERWARDS
MINUS THE BASENESS IT IS OUR CONVICTION THAT IF SOULS WERE VISIBLE TO THE EYES WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE DISTINCTLY THAT STRANGE THING THAT EACH ONE INDIVIDUAL OF THE HUMAN RACE CORRESPONDS TO SOME ONE OF THE SPECIES OF THE ANIMAL CREATION
COME IN SAID HE IT WAS SISTER SIMPLICE SHE WAS PALE HER EYES WERE RED THE CANDLE WHICH SHE CARRIED TREMBLED IN HER HAND THE PECULIAR FEATURE OF THE VIOLENCES OF DESTINY IS
AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF AN INDESCRIBABLE FOUNDATION OF RIGIDITY REGULARITY AND PROBITY COMPLICATED WITH AN INEXPRESSIBLE HATRED FOR THE RACE OF BOHEMIANS WHENCE HE WAS SPRUNG HE ENTERED THE POLICE
HUMAN FACE WHICH WE HAVE JUST APPLIED TO JAVERT THE HUMAN FACE OF JAVERT CONSISTED OF A FLAT NOSE WITH TWO DEEP NOSTRILS TOWARDS WHICH ENORMOUS WHISKERS ASCENDED ON HIS CHEEKS
ALL DAY LONG CONVERSATIONS LIKE THE FOLLOWING WERE TO BE HEARD IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE TOWN YOU DON'T KNOW HE WAS A LIBERATED CONVICT WHO THE MAYOR
AND THE FLAT CANDLESTICK WHICH HE USED EVERY EVENING TO GO UP TO HIS QUARTERS THEN SHE HUNG THE KEY ON THE NAIL WHENCE HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO TAKE IT AND SET THE CANDLESTICK ON ONE SIDE AS THOUGH SHE WAS EXPECTING HIM THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN ON HER CHAIR
HE HAD NOT SEEN MADELEINE'S BEGINNINGS JAVERT OWED THE POST WHICH HE OCCUPIED TO THE PROTECTION OF
YOU HAVE NOT SEEN A CERTAIN PERSON A MAN THIS EVENING HE HAS ESCAPED WE ARE IN SEARCH OF HIM THAT JEAN VALJEAN YOU HAVE NOT SEEN HIM THE SISTER REPLIED NO SHE LIED
AND STOOD THERE WITH GAPING MOUTH AND A SHRIEK WHICH SHE CONFINED TO HER THROAT SHE KNEW THAT HAND THAT ARM THE SLEEVE OF THAT COAT
AND WITHAL A LIFE OF PRIVATION ISOLATION ABNEGATION CHASTITY WITH NEVER A DIVERSION IT WAS IMPLACABLE DUTY THE POLICE UNDERSTOOD AS THE SPARTANS UNDERSTOOD SPARTA A PITILESS LYING IN WAIT
WOE TO THE MAN WHO FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE WOULD HAVE ARRESTED HIS OWN FATHER IF THE LATTER HAD ESCAPED FROM THE GALLEYS AND WOULD HAVE DENOUNCED HIS MOTHER IF SHE HAD BROKEN HER BAN AND HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT WITH THAT SORT OF INWARD SATISFACTION WHICH IS CONFERRED BY VIRTUE
AND ABSORBED IN SAD REFLECTIONS THE FACTORY HAD BEEN CLOSED ALL DAY THE CARRIAGE GATE WAS BOLTED THE STREET WAS DESERTED THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE BUT THE TWO NUNS
O SAINTED MAID YOU LEFT THIS WORLD MANY YEARS AGO YOU HAVE REJOINED YOUR SISTERS THE VIRGINS AND YOUR BROTHERS THE ANGELS IN THE LIGHT MAY THIS LIE BE COUNTED TO YOUR CREDIT IN PARADISE THE SISTER'S AFFIRMATION WAS FOR JAVERT
IS OF COURSE FROM THE RESTRICTED POINT OF VIEW OF THE TERRESTRIAL LIFE WHICH IS APPARENT AND WITHOUT PREJUDGING THE PROFOUND QUESTION OF THE ANTERIOR OR ULTERIOR PERSONALITY OF THE BEINGS WHICH ARE NOT MAN THE VISIBLE I
SHE IS WITH THAT POOR WOMAN NO DOUBT THE OLD WOMAN OBEYED IN ALL HASTE HE GAVE HER NO ORDERS HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT SHE WOULD GUARD HIM BETTER THAN HE SHOULD GUARD HIMSELF
HE SUCCEEDED THERE AT FORTY YEARS OF AGE HE WAS AN INSPECTOR DURING HIS YOUTH HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE CONVICT ESTABLISHMENTS OF THE SOUTH BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER
HIS COAT WAS CAREFULLY BUTTONED HE WAS VERY PALE AND HE TREMBLED SLIGHTLY
NOT A MOUTH BREATHED THE FIRST COMMOTION OF ASTONISHMENT HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY A SILENCE LIKE THAT OF THE GRAVE THOSE WITHIN THE HALL EXPERIENCED THAT SORT OF RELIGIOUS TERROR WHICH SEIZES THE MASSES WHEN SOMETHING GRAND HAS BEEN DONE
AND SUPERVISION HE HAD INTRODUCED A STRAIGHT LINE INTO WHAT IS THE MOST CROOKED THING IN THE WORLD HE POSSESSED THE CONSCIENCE OF HIS USEFULNESS THE RELIGION OF HIS FUNCTIONS AND HE WAS A SPY AS OTHER MEN ARE PRIESTS
AS FOR THE REST HE HAD VERY LITTLE SKULL AND A GREAT DEAL OF JAW HIS HAIR CONCEALED HIS FOREHEAD AND FELL OVER HIS EYEBROWS BETWEEN HIS EYES THERE WAS A PERMANENT CENTRAL FROWN LIKE AN IMPRINT OF WRATH HIS GAZE WAS OBSCURE
BUT HIS GUMS AND AROUND HIS NOSE THERE FORMED A FLATTENED AND SAVAGE FOLD AS ON THE MUZZLE OF A WILD BEAST JAVERT SERIOUS WAS A WATCHDOG
IN RESERVING AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE FROM WHAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD LEFT FOR THE POOR WHO WAS CONCERNED AFTER ALL A CONVICT AND A WOMAN OF THE TOWN THAT IS WHY HE HAD A VERY SIMPLE FUNERAL FOR FANTINE
AND WE COULD EASILY RECOGNIZE THIS TRUTH HARDLY PERCEIVED BY THE THINKER THAT FROM THE OYSTER TO THE EAGLE FROM THE PIG TO THE TIGER ALL ANIMALS EXIST IN MAN AND THAT EACH ONE OF THEM IS IN A MAN
I LIKED HIM LONG AGO SAID MARGARET GLANCING DOWN FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SHE LOOKED STRAIGHT UP AND WENT ON IN HER NATURAL MANNER YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN CORRESPONDING ABOUT FREDERICK SINCE BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS
IT GAVE A NEW DIRECTION TO HIS THOUGHTS YOU HAVE KNOWN MISS HALE FOR A LONG TIME I BELIEVE
AND HOW WELL I ROUNDED MY SENTENCE I AM ABSOLUTELY CATCHING THE TRICK OF GOOD MANNERS HIS SELF SATISFACTION LASTED HIM TILL HE WAS FAIRLY OUT IN THE STREETS WALKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH HENRY LENNOX
AND A FAIR INDICATION OF HIS CHARACTER DO YOU CALL HIM GOOD LOOKING MARGARET NO CERTAINLY NOT DO YOU NOT I BUT I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT IS HE A GREAT DEAL HERE
YOU SHALL MAKE ME SOME TEA MARGARET AND NOW WHAT WERE YOU THINKING OF YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME WHOSE LETTERS WERE THOSE GOD DAUGHTER THAT YOU HID AWAY SO SPEEDILY ONLY DIXON'S REPLIED MARGARET
SHE STRIKES ME AS PALE AND ILL I THOUGHT HER LOOKING REMARKABLY WELL PERHAPS NOT WHEN I FIRST CAME IN NOW I THINK OF IT BUT CERTAINLY WHEN SHE GREW ANIMATED SHE LOOKED AS WELL AS EVER I SAW HER DO
FIRST BY ASKING ME TO BREAKFAST TO MEET MISTER BELL AND SECONDLY BY BEING SO KIND AS TO ORDER IT AT HALF PAST NINE INSTEAD OF TEN O'CLOCK I HAVE SOME LETTERS AND PAPERS
BUT I WILL CERTAINLY COME IF YOU WISH IT REPLIED MISTER LENNOX WITH A LITTLE AFTERTHOUGHT OF EXTREME WILLINGNESS WHICH MADE MARGARET SHRINK INTO HERSELF AND ALMOST WISH THAT SHE HAD NOT PROPOSED HER NATURAL REQUEST
THEN ALL THE LATENT VASHTI IN MARGARET WAS ROUSED AND SHE COULD HARDLY KEEP HERSELF FROM EXPRESSING HER FEELINGS THE COURSE OF MARGARET'S DAY WAS THIS A QUIET HOUR OR TWO BEFORE A LATE BREAKFAST AN UNPUNCTUAL MEAL
MARGARET SUSPECTED HIM OF BEING AS THANKFUL AS SHE WAS AT THE PRESENCE OF A THIRD PARTY ON THIS THEIR FIRST MEETING SINCE THE MEMORABLE DAY OF HIS OFFER AND HER REFUSAL AT HELSTONE SHE COULD HARDLY TELL WHAT TO SAY AT FIRST
HE WAS WITH MAMMA WHEN SHE DIED SAID MARGARET SOFTLY TO BE SURE TO BE SURE WHY SOME ONE ASKED ME IF HE HAD NOT BEEN OVER THEN
HE HAS PROVED HIMSELF A VERY ACTIVE FRIEND OF YOURS I CAN TELL YOU TAKEN MORE THAN HALF THE TROUBLE OFF MY HANDS AND HOW IS HE HOW IS MISSUS THORNTON ASKED MARGARET HURRIEDLY AND BELOW HER BREATH THOUGH SHE TRIED TO SPEAK OUT
SO I THOUGHT IF YOU WERE GOING TO DINE I MIGHT TRY AND MAKE OUT MY DINNER BUT NEVER MIND NEVER MIND THERE AREN'T TEN COOKS IN ENGLAND TO BE TRUSTED AT IMPROMPTU DINNERS IF THEIR SKILL AND THEIR FIRES WILL STAND IT THEIR TEMPERS WON'T
IF SHE COULD NOT ASSIST WITH HER ADVICE AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF NOTES TO WRITE WHICH EDITH INVARIABLY LEFT TO HER
BUT CERTAINLY THEIR LIVES ARE SUCH AS VERY OFTEN TO PRODUCE EITHER INORDINATE SELF SUFFICIENCY OR A MORBID STATE OF CONSCIENCE REPLIED MISTER LENNOX WITH PERFECT COOLNESS YOU DON'T MEET WITH ANY SELF SUFFICIENCY AMONG THE LAWYERS FOR INSTANCE
I SHALL NEVER NAME HIS HAVING BEEN IN ENGLAND I SHALL BE OUT OF TEMPTATION FOR NO ONE WILL ASK ME STAY INTERRUPTING HIMSELF RATHER ABRUPTLY WAS IT AT YOUR MOTHER'S FUNERAL
EVEN IN THE SHAPE OF AN OLD FELLOW OF A COLLEGE WHICH NOBODY HAD EVER HEARD OF MISSUS SHAW AND CAPTAIN LENNOX EACH IN THEIR SEPARATE WAY GAVE MISTER BELL A KIND AND SINCERE WELCOME
JUST BEFORE MARGARET HAD RECOVERED FROM HER NECESSITY FOR QUIET AND REPOSE BEFORE SHE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL HER LIFE WANTING AND DULL EDITH CAME DOWN STAIRS AND RESUMED HER USUAL PART IN THE HOUSEHOLD
BUT ALL THE ANNOYANCE WHICH HER FATHER'S CONDUCT MUST HAVE CAUSED HER AND THEN HER FATHER'S CONDUCT SAID MISTER BELL IN AN ACCENT OF SURPRISE YOU MUST HAVE HEARD SOME WRONG STATEMENT HE BEHAVED IN THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS MANNER
I DIFFER FROM YOU I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE VERY APT TO DO AS MY POOR FRIEND HALE DID MISTER BELL WAS INWARDLY CHAFING PERHAPS I USED TOO GENERAL AN EXPRESSION IN SAYING VERY APT
I FANCY HE IS WHEN HE IS IN TOWN HE HAS BEEN ON CIRCUIT NOW SINCE I CAME BUT MISTER BELL HAVE YOU COME FROM OXFORD OR FROM MILTON FROM MILTON DON'T YOU SEE I'M SMOKE DRIED CERTAINLY
A LITTLE PLAY WITH SHOLTO AS HE RETURNED FROM HIS MORNING'S WALK BESIDES THE CARE OF THE CHILDREN DURING THE SERVANTS DINNER A DRIVE OR CALLERS AND SOME DINNER OR MORNING ENGAGEMENT FOR HER AUNT AND COUSINS WHICH LEFT MARGARET FREE IT IS TRUE
QUESTIONING WITHIN HERSELF IF NO ONE IN ALL THE CROWD MISSED HER NOT HIGGINS SHE WAS NOT THINKING OF HIM WHEN SUDDENLY MISTER BELL WAS ANNOUNCED AND MARGARET HURRIED THE LETTERS INTO HER WORK BASKET AND STARTED UP
AND ALL THE SMALL HOUSEHOLD CARES OF COMPARATIVE POVERTY COMPOSED HER IDEA OF HOME EDITH WAS IMPATIENT TO GET WELL IN ORDER TO FILL MARGARET'S BED ROOM WITH ALL THE SOFT COMFORTS AND PRETTY NICK KNACKS WITH WHICH HER OWN ABOUNDED
HE USED TO GO AND SIT IN HIS OWN ROOM PERPETUALLY HE'S GETTING PAST THE AGE FOR CARING FOR SUCH THINGS EITHER AS PRINCIPAL OR ACCESSORY
EDITH DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO FROWN OR TO SMILE BUT IT DID NOT SUIT MISTER LENNOX TO DRIVE HER TO THE FIRST OF THESE ALTERNATIVES SO HE WENT ON WILL YOU SHOW YOUR READINESS TO MAKE SACRIFICES TO MORROW MORNING
WINNING HIM OVER TO LIKE THEM ALMOST IN SPITE OF HIMSELF ESPECIALLY WHEN HE SAW HOW NATURALLY MARGARET TOOK HER PLACE AS SISTER AND DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE WHAT A SHAME THAT WE WERE NOT AT HOME TO RECEIVE YOU SAID EDITH YOU TOO HENRY
MISSUS SHAW AND HER MAID FOUND PLENTY OF OCCUPATION IN RESTORING MARGARET'S WARDROBE TO A STATE OF ELEGANT VARIETY CAPTAIN LENNOX WAS EASY KIND AND GENTLEMANLY
UNLESS INDEED THAT VEILED CURIOSITY OF HIS
WITH A VIEW OF GETTING OVER AN AWKWARD MEETING AWKWARD EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN LENNOX AND EDITH AND DOUBLY AWKWARD NOW THAT HE FOUND HER THE ONLY LADY THERE AND THE PERSON TO WHOM HE MUST NATURALLY
AND AS HE HAD TALKED PRETTY MUCH FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING AND SO PASSING THE TIME WHILE THEIR ROAD LAY TOGETHER HE WAS VERY INDIFFERENT AS TO THE EXACT SIDE HE TOOK UPON THE QUESTION AND QUIETLY CAME ROUND BY SAYING
AND MISSUS SHAW HERSELF SEEMED TO TAKE EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF PLEASURE IN THE VERY DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENTS AND CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCES WHICH WERE TO CAPTAIN AND MISSUS LENNOX'S TASTE AS SHE DID IN THE MORE FORMAL AND PONDEROUS ENTERTAINMENTS WHICH SHE HERSELF USED TO GIVE
WITH HALF THE TROUBLE YOUR MILTON LANDLORD HAS GIVEN ME AND DEFEATED ME AFTER ALL HE WON'T TAKE THE HOUSE OFF OUR HANDS TILL NEXT JUNE TWELVEMONTH LUCKILY MISTER THORNTON FOUND A TENANT FOR IT WHY DON'T YOU ASK AFTER MISTER THORNTON MARGARET
HERE HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED MARGARET'S LITTLE LOOK OF ENTREATY AS SHE URGED HIM TO STAY LONGER AND HE ALSO RECOLLECTED A FEW HINTS GIVEN HIM LONG AGO BY AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MISTER LENNOX'S AS TO HIS ADMIRATION OF MARGARET
AND SHE WAS CONSEQUENTLY RATHER INCLINED TO FANCY HERSELF ILL BUT ALL THE REST OF THE FAMILY WERE IN THE FULL BUSINESS OF THE LONDON SEASON AND MARGARET WAS OFTEN LEFT ALONE THEN HER THOUGHTS WENT BACK TO MILTON
SHE HAS HAD A GREAT DEAL TO GO THROUGH SAID MISTER BELL YES I HAVE BEEN SORRY TO HEAR OF ALL SHE HAS HAD TO BEAR NOT MERELY THE COMMON AND UNIVERSAL SORROW ARISING FROM DEATH
MARGARET AS IF SHE READ HIS THOUGHT ADDRESSED HERSELF TO MISTER BELL BOTH INCLUDING HIM IN THE CONVERSATION AND IMPLYING THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY AWARE OF THE ENDEAVOURS THAT HAD BEEN MADE TO CLEAR FREDERICK THAT HORROCKS
BUT I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE THE EFFECT OF THE ANTIQUITIES OF OXFORD COME NOW BE A SENSIBLE WOMAN IN OXFORD I COULD HAVE MANAGED ALL THE LANDLORDS IN THE PLACE AND HAD MY OWN WAY
WITH A STRANGE SENSE OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE LIFE THERE AND HERE SHE WAS GETTING SURFEITED OF THE EVENTLESS EASE IN WHICH NO STRUGGLE OR ENDEAVOUR WAS REQUIRED
THAT VERY LAST WITNESS OF ALL HAS PROVED AS UNAVAILING AS ALL THE OTHERS MISTER LENNOX HAS DISCOVERED THAT HE SAILED FOR AUSTRALIA ONLY LAST AUGUST ONLY TWO MONTHS BEFORE FREDERICK WAS IN ENGLAND AND GAVE US THE NAMES OF
BUT THINKING OVER THEM AND RECALLING THE DAYS WHICH HAD BEEN AND PICTURING THE BUSY LIFE OUT OF WHICH HER OWN HAD BEEN TAKEN AND NEVER MISSED WONDERING IF ALL WENT ON IN THAT WHIRL JUST AS IF SHE AND HER FATHER HAD NEVER BEEN
AND FOR MISTER BELL FOR MARGARET'S MISTER BELL THERE IS NO KNOWING WHAT SACRIFICES YOU WOULD NOT HAVE MADE SAID HER BROTHER IN LAW EVEN A DINNER PARTY AND THE DELIGHT OF WEARING THIS VERY BECOMING DRESS
BUT I'M DISPOSED TO BE MOVING OFF HOMEWARDS I'VE BEEN A JOURNEY TO DAY AND JOURNEYS BEGIN TO TELL UPON MY SIXTY AND ODD YEARS I BELIEVE I SHALL STAY AND SEE MY BROTHER AND SISTER SAID MISTER LENNOX
SATE WITH HIS WIFE IN HER DRESSING ROOM AN HOUR OR TWO EVERY DAY PLAYED WITH HIS LITTLE BOY FOR ANOTHER HOUR AND LOUNGED AWAY THE REST OF HIS TIME AT HIS CLUB WHEN HE WAS NOT ENGAGED OUT TO DINNER
BUT YET AT WHICH IN ALL ITS DRAGGED OUT LENGTH SHE WAS EXPECTED TO BE PRESENT BECAUSE DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS CAME A DISCUSSION OF PLANS AT WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY NONE OF THEM CONCERNED HER SHE WAS EXPECTED TO GIVE HER SYMPATHY
SHE WAS AFRAID LEST SHE SHOULD EVEN BECOME SLEEPILY DEADENED INTO FORGETFULNESS OF ANYTHING BEYOND THE LIFE WHICH WAS LAPPING HER ROUND WITH LUXURY THERE MIGHT BE TOILERS AND MOILERS THERE IN LONDON BUT SHE NEVER SAW THEM
AND SO HAD NO OCCASION TO RESIGN BUT THE TRUTH IS THESE COUNTRY CLERGYMEN LIVE SUCH ISOLATED LIVES ISOLATED I MEAN FROM ALL INTERCOURSE WITH MEN OF EQUAL CULTIVATION WITH THEMSELVES BY WHOSE MINDS THEY MIGHT REGULATE THEIR OWN
COWPER OF WHAT EACH ONE SHOULD BE HE SEES THE FORM AND RULE AND TILL HE REACH TO THAT HIS JOY CAN NE'ER BE FULL RUCKERT
IN SPITE OF ALL THE TEMPTATIONS OF SUCH AGREEABLE COMPANY SAID MISTER BELL BOWING ALL ROUND AND SECRETLY CONGRATULATING HIMSELF ON THE NEAT TURN HE HAD GIVEN TO HIS SENTENCE WHICH IF PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE
MISTER BELL GOT UP AND LOOKED AROUND HIM FOR HIS HAT WHICH HAD BEEN REMOVED TO MAKE ROOM FOR TEA
HE LOOKED AT HER AND SAW THE CONFUSION STIRRING IN HER COUNTENANCE HE SATE DOWN AGAIN AS IF HER LITTLE TOUCH HAD BEEN POSSESSED OF RESISTLESS STRENGTH YOU SEE HOW SHE OVERPOWERS ME MISTER LENNOX SAID HE
LANGUIDLY STROKED MARGARET'S CHEEK AS SHE SAT BY HER IN THE OLD ATTITUDE SHE ON A FOOTSTOOL BY THE SOFA WHERE EDITH LAY POOR CHILD SAID EDITH IT IS A LITTLE SAD FOR YOU TO BE LEFT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
SUCH A CHANGE FROM HELSTONE IT IS YEARS SINCE I HAVE BEEN AT HELSTONE BUT I'LL ANSWER FOR IT IT IS STANDING THERE YET EVERY STICK AND EVERY STONE AS IT HAS DONE FOR THE LAST CENTURY WHILE MILTON I GO THERE EVERY FOUR OR FIVE YEARS
BLUSHING AS IF SHE HAD BEEN DOING SOME GUILTY THING OH MISTER BELL I NEVER THOUGHT OF SEEING YOU BUT YOU GIVE ME A WELCOME I HOPE AS WELL AS THAT VERY PRETTY START OF SURPRISE HAVE YOU DINED
MARGARET DID NOT FEEL AS IF THE DINNER PARTIES WOULD BE A PANACEA BUT EDITH PIQUED HERSELF ON HER DINNER PARTIES SO DIFFERENT AS SHE SAID FROM THE OLD DOWAGER DINNERS UNDER MAMMA'S REGIME
OH YES AND IT IS SUCH A REST I WAS JUST THINKING BUT WILL YOU RUN THE RISK OF DINNER I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE WHY TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I DINED AT MY CLUB ONLY THEY DON'T COOK AS WELL AS THEY DID
THE OLD SERVANT HAD BEEN BUSILY ENGAGED IN WINDING UP ALL THE AFFAIRS OF THE HALE FAMILY IT HAD APPEARED A SUDDEN FAMINE TO HER HEART THIS ENTIRE CESSATION OF ANY NEWS RESPECTING THE PEOPLE AMONGST WHOM SHE HAD LIVED SO LONG
WHAT'S THE RIGHT NAME FOR A COUSIN IN LAW'S BROTHER MISTER HENRY LENNOX ASKED MARGARET YES REPLIED MISTER BELL
THAT LAST DAY AT HELSTONE ONLY HALF MOLLIFIED AND YET ANXIOUS IN ORDER TO LULL CERTAIN QUALMS OF HIS OWN CONSCIENCE
AND PERFORCE ADDRESS A GREAT PART OF HIS CONVERSATION SHE WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER HER SELF POSSESSION SHE BEGAN TO TALK ON THE SUBJECT WHICH CAME UPPERMOST IN HER MIND AFTER THE FIRST FLUSH OF AWKWARD SHYNESS MISTER LENNOX
MISTER BELL GROWLED OUT
COULD HAVE REPORTED HER AS HAVING LOST ALL HER GOOD LOOKS TO BE SURE IN HER QUIET BLACK DRESS SHE WAS A CONTRAST TO EDITH DANCING IN HER WHITE CRAPE MOURNING AND LONG FLOATING GOLDEN HAIR ALL SOFTNESS AND GLITTER
I HOPE MISTER BELL WILL MAKE OUR HOUSE HIS OWN DURING HIS STAY IN LONDON SAID CAPTAIN LENNOX I AM ONLY SO SORRY WE CANNOT OFFER HIM A BED ROOM THANK YOU I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
THERE WAS A STRANGE UNSATISFIED VACUUM IN MARGARET'S HEART AND MODE OF LIFE AND ONCE WHEN SHE HAD DIMLY HINTED THIS TO EDITH THE LATTER WEARIED WITH DANCING THE NIGHT BEFORE
JUST AT THIS TIME WHEN ALL THE WORLD IS SO GAY BUT WE SHALL BE HAVING OUR DINNER PARTIES SOON AS SOON AS HENRY COMES BACK FROM CIRCUIT AND THEN THERE WILL BE A LITTLE PLEASANT VARIETY FOR YOU NO WONDER IT IS MOPED POOR DARLING
SAID MARGARET A LITTLE DISMAYED I HAVE NEVER NAMED IT TO EITHER MY BROTHER OR YOUR COUSIN SAID MISTER LENNOX WITH A LITTLE PROFESSIONAL DRYNESS OF IMPLIED REPROACH NEVER MIND MARGARET
AND HE MAY BE CHANGED WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HIM I DON'T KNOW HE WAS SO BUSY TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO I WAS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AND WHAT I WAS IN THE SECOND THAT HE NEVER LET OUT WHAT HE WAS
MAKING NO MOVEMENT OF DEPARTURE MARGARET WAS SEIZED WITH A SHY AWKWARD DREAD OF BEING LEFT ALONE WITH HIM THE SCENE ON THE LITTLE TERRACE IN THE HELSTONE GARDEN WAS SO PRESENT TO HER THAT SHE COULD HARDLY HELP BELIEVING IT WAS SO WITH HIM
PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN WRONGLY INFORMED BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE LIVING A CLEVER SENSIBLE MAN AND A THOROUGHLY ACTIVE CLERGYMAN THAT THERE WAS NO CALL UPON MISTER HALE TO DO WHAT HE DID RELINQUISH THE LIVING
OH HERE IS TEA AT LAST EXCLAIMED SHE AS IF RELIEVED AND WITH TEA CAME MISTER HENRY LENNOX WHO HAD WALKED UP TO HARLEY STREET AFTER A LATE DINNER AND HAD EVIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND HIS BROTHER AND SISTER IN LAW AT HOME
THAT THEY ARE VERY APT TO DISTURB THEMSELVES WITH IMAGINARY DOUBTS AS TO THE ARTICLES OF FAITH AND THROW UP CERTAIN OPPORTUNITIES OF DOING GOOD FOR VERY UNCERTAIN FANCIES OF THEIR OWN
IT WAS VERY WELL FOR MARGARET THAT THE EXTREME QUIET OF THE HARLEY STREET HOUSE DURING EDITH'S RECOVERY FROM HER CONFINEMENT GAVE HER THE NATURAL REST WHICH SHE NEEDED IT GAVE HER TIME TO COMPREHEND THE SUDDEN CHANGE
I SUPPOSE AS MISTER BELL IS NOW ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING YOUR BROTHER'S UNFORTUNATE DILEMMA I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN INFORM HIM EXACTLY HOW THE RESEARCH INTO THE EVIDENCE WE ONCE HOPED TO PRODUCE IN HIS FAVOUR STANDS AT PRESENT
IT WAS TRUE THAT DIXON IN HER BUSINESS LETTERS QUOTED EVERY NOW AND THEN AN OPINION OF MISTER THORNTON'S AS TO WHAT SHE HAD BETTER DO ABOUT THE FURNITURE OR HOW ACT IN REGARD TO THE LANDLORD OF THE CRAMPTON TERRACE HOUSE
I HAVE BEEN SO MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE ABOUT FREDERICK I AM ONLY SORRY IT HAS BEEN SO UNSUCCESSFUL REPLIED HE WITH A QUICK GLANCE TOWARDS MISTER BELL AS IF RECONNOITRING HOW MUCH HE MIGHT SAY BEFORE HIM
WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO THIS EFFECT I COULDN'T STAND THE RESTRAINTS OF SUCH A PROPER BEHAVED AND CIVIL SPOKEN SET OF PEOPLE AS THESE ARE IT WOULD BE LIKE MEAT WITHOUT SALT I'M THANKFUL THEY HAVEN'T A BED
WHO COULD IT HAVE BEEN OH I RECOLLECT BUT HE DID NOT SAY THE NAME AND ALTHOUGH MARGARET WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO KNOW IF HER SUSPICIONS WERE RIGHT AND IT HAD BEEN MISTER THORNTON WHO HAD MADE THE ENQUIRY
MISSUS LENNOX IS TO KNOW ME
AND SHE FELT THAT IT WAS ALMOST UNGRATEFUL IN HER TO HAVE A SECRET FEELING THAT THE HELSTONE VICARAGE NAY EVEN THE POOR LITTLE HOUSE AT MILTON WITH HER ANXIOUS FATHER AND HER INVALID MOTHER
I DARE NOT ASK YOU BOTH TO BREAKFAST THOUGH I AM SURE YOU WOULD BE WELCOME BUT LET ME KNOW ALL I CAN ABOUT FREDERICK EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE NO HOPE AT PRESENT I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT AT HALF PAST ELEVEN
I AM NOT LIVING IN A TALKING BABBLING WORLD NOR YET AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO WORM FACTS OUT OF ME YOU NEEDN'T LOOK SO FRIGHTENED BECAUSE YOU HAVE LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG TO A FAITHFUL OLD HERMIT LIKE ME
THE VERY SERVANTS LIVED IN AN UNDERGROUND WORLD OF THEIR OWN OF WHICH SHE KNEW NEITHER THE HOPES NOR THE FEARS THEY ONLY SEEMED TO START INTO EXISTENCE WHEN SOME WANT OR WHIM OF THEIR MASTER AND MISTRESS NEEDED THEM
TO BE SURE THERE IS SOMETHING FINE IN A MAN OF MISTER HALE'S AGE LEAVING HIS HOME OF TWENTY YEARS AND GIVING UP ALL SETTLED HABITS FOR AN IDEA WHICH WAS PROBABLY ERRONEOUS BUT THAT DOES NOT MATTER AN UNTANGIBLE THOUGHT
I SUPPOSE THEY'RE WELL I'VE BEEN STAYING AT THEIR HOUSE TILL I WAS DRIVEN OUT OF IT BY THE PERPETUAL CLACK ABOUT THAT THORNTON GIRL'S MARRIAGE IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR THORNTON HIMSELF THOUGH SHE WAS HIS SISTER
AND I HOPE YOU NOTICED THE HAPPY CHOICE OF HER EXPRESSIONS SHE WANTS ME TO SEE THIS COUSIN EDITH WHO I AM TOLD IS A GREAT BEAUTY
AND I WAS BORN THERE YET I DO ASSURE YOU I OFTEN LOSE MY WAY AYE AMONG THE VERY PILES OF WAREHOUSES THAT ARE BUILT UPON MY FATHER'S ORCHARD DO WE PART HERE
BUT IT WAS ONLY HERE AND THERE THAT THE NAME CAME IN OR ANY MILTON NAME INDEED AND MARGARET WAS SITTING ONE EVENING ALL ALONE IN THE LENNOXES'S DRAWING ROOM NOT READING DIXON'S LETTERS WHICH YET SHE HELD IN HER HAND
WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN HER CIRCUMSTANCES WITHIN THE LAST TWO MONTHS SHE FOUND HERSELF AT ONCE AN INMATE OF A LUXURIOUS HOUSE WHERE THE BARE KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXISTENCE OF EVERY TROUBLE OR CARE SEEMED SCARCELY TO HAVE PENETRATED
ONE CANNOT HELP ADMIRING HIM WITH A MIXTURE OF PITY IN ONE'S ADMIRATION SOMETHING LIKE WHAT ONE FEELS FOR DON QUIXOTE SUCH A GENTLEMAN AS HE WAS TOO I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE REFINED AND SIMPLE HOSPITALITY HE SHOWED TO ME
SO IF HE WILL DO ME THE HONOUR TO BREAKFAST WITH ME TO MORROW WE WILL GO OVER THE NAMES OF THESE MISSING GENTRY I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR ALL THE PARTICULARS IF I MAY CANNOT YOU COME HERE
AND MARGARET FELL INTO THE OLD HABIT OF WATCHING AND ADMIRING AND MINISTERING TO HER COUSIN SHE GLADLY TOOK ALL CHARGE OF THE SEMBLANCES OF DUTIES OFF EDITH'S HANDS ANSWERED NOTES REMINDED HER OF ENGAGEMENTS
CAPTAIN LENNOX WAS ALWAYS EXTREMELY KIND AND BROTHERLY TO MARGARET SHE WAS REALLY VERY FOND OF HIM EXCEPTING WHEN HE WAS ANXIOUSLY ATTENTIVE TO EDITH'S DRESS AND APPEARANCE WITH A VIEW TO HER BEAUTY MAKING A SUFFICIENT IMPRESSION ON THE WORLD
SHE COULD NOT ASK THE QUESTION OF MISTER BELL MUCH AS SHE LONGED TO DO SO THERE WAS A PAUSE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO THEN MISTER LENNOX SAID ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO MARGARET
AND THROW HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY ON THE TENDER MERCIES OF PRIVATE TEACHING IN A MANUFACTURING TOWN THE BISHOP HAD OFFERED HIM ANOTHER LIVING IT IS TRUE BUT IF HE HAD COME TO ENTERTAIN CERTAIN DOUBTS HE COULD HAVE REMAINED WHERE HE WAS
SHE DIMPLED AND BLUSHED MOST BECOMINGLY WHEN INTRODUCED TO MISTER BELL CONSCIOUS THAT SHE HAD HER REPUTATION AS A BEAUTY TO KEEP UP AND THAT IT WOULD NOT DO TO HAVE A MORDECAI REFUSING TO WORSHIP AND ADMIRE
BUT RATHER WEARIED WITH THE INACTIVITY OF THE DAY COMING UPON DEPRESSED SPIRITS AND DELICATE HEALTH SHE LOOKED FORWARD WITH LONGING THOUGH UNSPOKEN INTEREST TO THE HOMELY OBJECT OF DIXON'S RETURN FROM MILTON WHERE UNTIL NOW
SHE WOULD PUT ON ANY ASSUMPTION OF FEELING TO VEIL HER DAUGHTER'S WEAKNESS SAID MARGARET IN A LOW VOICE PERHAPS SO YOU'VE STUDIED HER HAVE YOU SHE DOESN'T SEEM OVER FOND OF YOU MARGARET I KNOW IT SAID MARGARET
HE JOKED TO GIVE HER TIME TO RECOVER FROM THE SLIGHT FLUTTER WHICH HE HAD DETECTED IN HER MANNER ON HIS PROPOSAL TO LEAVE AND SHE CAUGHT THE TONE AND THREW THE BALL BACK MISTER LENNOX WONDERED HOW HIS BROTHER THE CAPTAIN
ASKED MISTER BELL AND SELDOM I IMAGINE ANY CASES OF MORBID CONSCIENCE HE WAS BECOMING MORE AND MORE VEXED AND FORGETTING HIS LATELY CAUGHT TRICK OF GOOD MANNERS MISTER LENNOX SAW NOW THAT HE HAD ANNOYED HIS COMPANION
AND WAS THANKFUL FOR ALL THE TEA TABLE OCCUPATIONS WHICH GAVE HER AN EXCUSE FOR KEEPING SILENCE AND HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF RECOVERING HIMSELF FOR TO TELL THE TRUTH HE HAD RATHER FORCED HIMSELF UP TO HARLEY STREET THIS EVENING
HOW DID YOU COME LET ME ORDER YOU SOME DINNER IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ANY OTHERWISE YOU KNOW THERE IS NO ONE WHO CARES LESS FOR EATING THAN I DO BUT WHERE ARE THE OTHERS GONE OUT TO DINNER LEFT YOU ALONE
THE WHEELS OF THE MACHINERY OF DAILY LIFE WERE WELL OILED AND WENT ALONG WITH DELICIOUS SMOOTHNESS MISSUS SHAW AND EDITH COULD HARDLY MAKE ENOUGH OF MARGARET ON HER RETURN TO WHAT THEY PERSISTED IN CALLING HER HOME
FREDERICK IN ENGLAND YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT EXCLAIMED MISTER BELL IN SURPRISE I THOUGHT YOU KNEW I NEVER DOUBTED YOU HAD BEEN TOLD OF COURSE IT WAS A GREAT SECRET AND PERHAPS I SHOULD NOT HAVE NAMED IT NOW
GROWING VERY RED WHEW IS THAT ALL WHO DO YOU THINK CAME UP IN THE TRAIN WITH ME I DON'T KNOW SAID MARGARET RESOLVED AGAINST MAKING A GUESS
PAVED WITH HARD DUTCH BRICK LAID ON EDGE OR ASPHALTE OR SMITHY CLINKERS OR RUBBLE STONES LAID IN STRONG CEMENT IN THE CENTRE ABOUT FIVE FEET FROM THE WALL
TWICE A DAY A THIRD FEED AND A RACK FULL OF HAY
DANDY BRUSHES CURRYCOMBS BIRCH AND HEATH BROOMS TRIMMING COMBS SCISSORS AND PICKERS OIL CANS AND BRUSHES HARNESS BRUSHES OF THREE SORTS LEATHERS
IS ALTOGETHER FALLACIOUS IN THE MODERATE SENSE IN WHICH WE ARE VIEWING IT IN THE OLD COACHING DAYS INDEED WHEN THE SHREWSBURY WONDER DROVE INTO THE INN YARD WHILE THE CLOCK WAS STRIKING WEEK AFTER WEEK AND MOUTH AFTER MONTH
BUT IF RUBBED EVERY DAY WITH THE LEATHER LITTLE MORE WILL BE REQUIRED TO KEEP IT UNTARNISHED THE LININGS REQUIRE CAREFUL BRUSHING EVERY DAY THE CUSHIONS BEING TAKEN OUT AND BEATEN
A HARNESS ROOM IS INDISPENSABLE TO EVERY STABLE IT SHOULD BE DRY AND AIRY AND FURNISHED WITH A FIREPLACE AND BOILER BOTH FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE HARNESS
WITH THE ADDITIONAL DISADVANTAGE OF CONTINUAL EXPOSURE TO THE WEATHER
IT WAS DULY COMMITTED TO THE COACHMAN WHO WAS TO DRIVE IT AFTER SOME VERY SUCCESSFUL TRIALS IN HARNESS AND OUT OF IT AND SEEMED LIKELY TO GIVE GREAT SATISFACTION AFTER A TIME THE FRIEND GOT TIRED OF HIS CARRIAGE AND GAVE IT UP
BUT AGED HORSES AFTER A TIME LOSE THE POWER OF MASTICATING AND BRUISING THEM AND BOLT THEM WHOLE THUS MUCH IMPEDING THE WORK OF DIGESTION FOR AN OLD HORSE THEN BRUISE THE OATS
USING A WATER BRUSH FOR CORNERS WHERE THE MOP DOES NOT PENETRATE EVERY PARTICLE OF MUD AND SAND REMOVED BY THE MOP AND AFTERWARDS WITH A WET SPONGE THE CARRIAGE IS WIPED DRY AND
WHEN THE BRIGHTON AGE TOOL'D AND HORSED BY THE LATE MISTER STEVENSON USED TO DASH ROUND THE SQUARE AS THE FIFTH HOUR WAS STRIKING HAVING STOPPED AT THE HALF WAY HOUSE WHILE HIS SERVANT HANDED A SANDWICH AND A GLASS OF SHERRY TO HIS PASSENGERS
THE BODY IS THEN GONE CAREFULLY OVER WITH A SOFT MOP USING PLENTY OF CLEAN WATER AND PENETRATING INTO EVERY CORNER OF THE CARVED WORK SO THAT NOT AN ATOM OF DIRT REMAINS
THE PASSAGE BETWEEN THE STALL AND THE HALL SHOULD BE FROM FIVE TO SIX FEET BROAD AT LEAST ON THE WALL OPPOSITE TO EACH STALL
EXERCISE ALL HORSES NOT IN WORK REQUIRE AT LEAST TWO HOURS EXERCISE DAILY AND IN EXERCISING THEM A GOOD GROOM WILL PUT THEM THROUGH THE PACES TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED
AND TO PREPARE MASHES FOR THE HORSES WHEN REQUIRED THE PARTITION WALL SHOULD BE BOARDED WHERE THE HARNESS GOES WITH PEGS TO HANG THE VARIOUS PIECES OF HARNESS ON WITH SADDLE TREES TO REST THE SADDLES ON
PLACE THIS AGAIN ON THE FIRE AND STIR TILL IT BOILS ANEW AND SUFFER IT TO COOL WHEN COOLED A LITTLE ADD DISTILLED TURPENTINE TILL IT HAS THE CONSISTENCE OF A THICKISH PASTE
HAVING WITH OR WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE GROOM OR STABLE BOY PUT HIS HORSES TO THE CARRIAGE AND SATISFIED HIMSELF BY WALKING ROUND THEM THAT EVERYTHING IS PROPERLY ARRANGED
THE WEAR OF THE CARRIAGE AND HORSES HE SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CARRIAGE TO KNOW WHEN IT IS OUT OF ORDER TO KNOW ALSO THE PACE AT WHICH HE CAN GO OVER THE ROAD HE HAS UNDER HIM WITHOUT RISKING THE SPRINGS
BOTH OF WHICH SHOULD BE DONE EVERY DAY AND EVERY CORNER CAREFULLY SWEPT IN ORDER TO KEEP THE STABLE SWEET AND CLEAN THE REAL DUTIES OF THE GROOM FOLLOW WHERE THE HORSES ARE NOT TAKEN OUT FOR EARLY EXERCISE
THE STABLES SHOULD BE OPENED AND CLEANED OUT AND THE HORSES FED FIRST BY CLEANING THE RACK AND THROWING IN FRESH HAY PUTTING IT LIGHTLY IN THE RACK THAT THE HORSES MAY GET IT OUT EASILY
THESE DUTIES HOWEVER ARE ONLY INCIDENTAL TO THE COACHMAN'S OFFICE WHICH IS TO DRIVE AND MUCH OF THE ENJOYMENT OF THOSE IN THE CARRIAGE DEPENDS ON HIS PROFICIENCY IN HIS ART MUCH ALSO OF
RIVER WATER IS THE BEST FOR ALL PURPOSES AND ANYTHING IS PREFERABLE TO SPRING WATER WHICH SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE SUN IN SUMMER FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AND STIRRED UP BEFORE USING IT
BY CHANGING THE HANDS TAKING CARE IN ALL THESE OPERATIONS TO CARRY THE HAND IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COAT STAINS ON THE HAIR ARE REMOVED BY SPONGING OR WHEN THE COAT IS VERY DIRTY BY THE WATER BRUSH
THE LATTER BEING CAREFULLY DRIED AND BEATEN WITH A SWITCH BEFORE IT IS AGAIN PUT ON IN WASHING A HORSE'S FEET AFTER A DAY'S WORK THE MASTER SHOULD INSIST UPON THE LEGS AND FEET BEING WASHED THOROUGHLY WITH A SPONGE
THE HORSECLOTH SHOULD NOW BE PUT ON BY TAKING THE CLOTH IN BOTH HANDS WITH THE OUTSIDE NEXT YOU AND WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND TO THE OFF SIDE THROW IT OVER HIS BACK
BESIDES SKILL IN DRIVING HE SHOULD POSSESS A GOOD GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF HORSES HE HAS USUALLY TO PURCHASE PROVENDER TO SEE THAT THE HORSES ARE REGULARLY FED AND PROPERLY GROOMED WATCH OVER THEIR CONDITION
APPLY SIMPLE REMEDIES TO TRIFLING AILMENTS IN THE ANIMALS UNDER HIS CHARGE AND REPORT WHERE HE OBSERVES SYMPTOMS OF MORE SERIOUS ONES WHICH HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HE HAS EITHER TO CLEAN THE CARRIAGE HIMSELF
AND CAUSES HIM TO REAR AND PLUNGE AND FINALLY BREAK SWAY IF HE CAN HE IS ALSO A BAD DRIVER WHEN THE REINS ARE ALWAYS SLACK THE HORSE THEN FEELS ABANDONED TO HIMSELF HE IS NEITHER DIRECTED NOR SUPPORTED
THE FURNITURE OF A STABLE WITH COACHHOUSE CONSISTS OF COACH MOPS JACKS FOR RAISING THE WHEELS HORSE BRUSHES SPOKE BRUSHES WATER BRUSHES CREST AND BIT BRUSHES
A HAY RACK PLACED WITHIN EASY REACH OF THE HORSE OF WOOD OR IRON OCCUPIES EITHER A CORNER OR THE WHOLE BREADTH OF THE STALL WHICH SHOULD BE ABOUT SIX FEET FOR ON ORDINARY SIZED HORSE A MANGER
TO SIMMER ON THE FIRE STIRRING THEM CONTINUALLY TILL ALL IS MELTED WHEN IT IS A LITTLE COOL
AN EXCELLENT PASTE FOR POLISHING HARNESS AND THE LEATHER WORK OF CARRIAGES
VENTILATION IS USUALLY ATTAINED BY THE INSERTION OF ONE OR MORE TUBES OR BOXES OF WOOD OR IRON THROUGH THE CEILING AND THE ROOF WITH A SLOPING COVERING OVER THE OPENING TO KEEP OUT RAIN
AND VALVES OR VENTILATORS BELOW TO REGULATE THE ATMOSPHERE WITH OPENINGS IN THE WALLS FOR THE ADMISSION OF FRESH AIR THIS IS STILL A DIFFICULTY HOWEVER FOR THE EFFLUVIUM OF THE STABLE IS DIFFICULT TO DISPEL AND DRAUGHTS MUST BE AVOIDED
AS SOON AFTER AS POSSIBLE THE VARNISH IS CAREFULLY POLISHED WITH SOFT LEATHER USING A LITTLE SWEET OIL FOR THE LEATHER PARTS AND EVEN FOR THE PANELS SO AS TO CHECK ANY TENDENCY OF THE VARNISH TO CRACK
WHEN THE LEATHER IS VERY OLD IT MAY BE SOFTENED WITH FISH OIL AND AFTER PUTTING ON THE INK A SPONGE CHARGED WITH DISTILLED TURPENTINE PASSED OVER TO SCOUR THE SURFACE OF THE LEATHER
STABLES THE ARCHITECTURAL FORM OF THE STABLES WILL BE SUBJECT TO OTHER INFLUENCES THAN OURS WE CONFINE OURSELVES THEREFORE TO THEIR INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS THEY SHOULD BE ROOMY IN PROPORTION TO THE NUMBER OF STALLS
A SOUND CEILING TO PREVENT THE ENTRANCE OF DUST FROM THE HAYLOFT WHICH IS USUALLY ABOVE THEM AND THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF LIGHT COMING HOWEVER EITHER FROM ABOVE OR BEHIND
BRIDLES EVERY TIME A HORSE IS UNBRIDLED THE BIT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY WASHED AND DRIED AND THE LEATHER WIPED TO KEEP THEM SWEET AS WELL AS THE GIRTHS AND SADDLE
THE BODY OF THE CARRIAGE IS THEN RAISED BY PLACING THE JACK UNDER THE AXLETREE AND RAISING IT SO THAT THE WHEEL TURNS FREELY THIS IS NOW THOROUGHLY WASHED WITH THE MOP UNTIL THE DIRT IS REMOVED
IN A GENERAL WAY WHERE A HORSE'S COAT IS HABITUALLY ROUGH AND UNTIDY THERE IS A SAD WANT OF ELBOW GREASE IN THE STABLE WHEN A HORSE OF TOLERABLE BREEDING IS DULL AND SPIRITLESS HE IS GETTING ILL OR BADLY FED
AND THE GLASS SASHES SHOULD ALWAYS BE BRIGHT AND CLEAN THE WHEEL TIRES AND AXLETREE ARE CAREFULLY SEEN TO AND GREASED WHEN REQUIRED THE BOLTS AND NUTS TIGHTENED
AND THEY ARE LEFT TO DO THEIR WORK BY MERE WEIGHT AND MUSCLE THEREFORE UNLESS HE HAS CONTRARY ORDERS A GOOD DRIVER WILL CHOOSE A SMART PACE BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS HORSES PERSPIRE
AND CURRY HIM BEFORE ON HIS BREAST AND LAYING YOUR RIGHT ARM OVER HIS BACK JOIN YOUR RIGHT SIDE TO HIS LEFT AND CURRY HIM ALL UNDER THE BELLY NEAR THE FORE BOWELS
PLACING IT NO FARTHER BACK THAN WILL LEAVE IT STRAIGHT AND LEVEL WHICH WILL BE ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE TAIL PUT THE ROLLER ROUND AND THE PAD PIECE UNDER IT ABOUT SIX OR EIGHT INCHES FROM THE FORE LEGS
UNDER THE HANDS OF A PROFESSIONAL TRAINER HE WAS SENT TO THE HAMMER AND SOLD FOR A SUM THAT DID NOT PAY FOR THE ATTEMPT TO BREAK HIM IN THIS MAXIM THEREFORE THAT IT'S THE PACE THAT KILLS
STAINS ARE REMOVED BY RUBBING THEM WITH THE LEATHER AND SWEET OIL IF THAT FAILS
FORMERLY OF WOOD BUT OF LATE YEARS MORE GENERALLY OF IRON LINED WITH ENAMEL OCCUPIES A CORNER OF THE STALL THE PAVEMENT OF THE STALL SHOULD BE NEARLY LEVEL WITH A SLIGHT INCLINE TOWARDS THE GUTTER TO KEEP THE BED DRY
IN DRIVING THE COACHMAN SHOULD NEVER GIVE WAY TO TEMPER HOW OFTEN DO WE SEE HORSES STUMBLE FROM BEING CONDUCTED OR AT LEAST ALLOWED TO GO OVER BAD GROUND BY SOME CARELESS DRIVER
THE REINS SHOULD ALWAYS BE HELD SO THAT THE HORSES ARE IN HAND BUT HE IS A VERY BAD DRIVER WHO ALWAYS DRIVES WITH A TIGHT REIN THE PAIN TO THE HORSE IS INTOLERABLE
THE PACE AT WHICH HE DRIVES WILL DEPEND UPON HIS ORDERS IN ALL PROBABILITY A MODERATE PACE OF SEVEN OR EIGHT MILES AN HOUR LESS SPEED IS INJURIOUS TO THE HORSES GETTING THEM INTO LAZY AND SLUGGISH HABITS
FOR FAWN OR YELLOW COLOURED LEATHER TAKE A QUART OF SKIMMED MILK POUR INTO IT ONE OZ OF SULPHURIC ACID AND WHEN COLD
MIXED UP TOGETHER UNDER THIS THE HORSES DID THEIR WORK WELL
THIS IS DONE BY FIRST WELL SLUSHING IT WITH CLEAN WATER SO AS TO WASH AWAY ALL PARTICLES OF SAND HAVING FIRST CLOSED THE SASHES TO AVOID WETTING THE LININGS
A BOARDED ONE BEING RECOMMENDED IT MUST BE REMOVED FROM THE AMMONIACAL INFLUENCE OF THE STABLES FROM OPEN DRAINS AND CESSPOOLS AND OTHER GASEOUS INFLUENCES LIKELY TO AFFECT THE PAINT AND VARNISH
GET THAT PACE OUT OF THEM SOME HORSES HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BE DRIVEN ON THE CHECK AND THE CURB IRRITATES THEM OTHERS WITH HARDER MOUTHS CANNOT BE CONTROLLED WITH THE SLIGHT LEVERAGE THIS AFFORDS HE MUST THEREFORE
MIGHT WITH MUCH MORE JUSTICE BE APPLIED TO HIS OWN BRUTAL SHOULDERS
THE HORSES ARE GUIDED AND ENCOURAGED AND ONLY PULLED UP WHEN THEY EXCEED THEIR INTENDED PACE OR IN THE EVENT OF A STUMBLE
WHEEL GREASE IS USUALLY PURCHASED AT THE SHOPS BUT A GOOD PASTE IS MADE AS FOLLOWS MELT EIGHTY PARTS OF GREASE AND STIR INTO IT MIXING IT THOROUGHLY AND SMOOTHLY
THE ESTABLISHMENT WE HAVE IN VIEW WILL CONSIST OF COACHMAN GROOM AND STABLE BOY WHO ARE CAPABLE OF KEEPING IN PERFECT ORDER FOUR HORSES AND PERHAPS THE PONY OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT THE COACHMAN IS CHIEF
UNTIL THE WATER FLOWS OVER THEM
AND HE WAS THANKFULLY ENOUGH RECEIVED BUT ON TRIAL IT WAS FOUND THAT A STUPID COACHMAN WHO WAS IMBUED WITH ONE OF THEIR OLD MAXIMS THAT IT'S THE PACE THAT KILLS HAD DRIVEN THE HORSE
WATERING USUALLY FOLLOWS DRESSING BUT SOME HORSES REFUSE THEIR FOOD UNTIL THEY HAVE DRUNK THE GROOM SHOULD NOT THEREFORE LAY DOWN EXCLUSIVE RULES ON THIS SUBJECT
OVER THE STABLES THERE SHOULD BE ACCOMMODATION FOR THE COACHMAN OR GROOM TO SLEEP ACCIDENTS SOMETIMES OCCUR AND HE SHOULD BE AT HAND TO INTERFERE
THE GROOM'S FIRST DUTIES ARE TO KEEP HIS HORSES IN CONDITION BUT HE IS SOMETIMES EXPECTED TO PERFORM THE DUTIES OF A VALET TO RIDE OUT WITH HIS MASTER ON OCCASIONS TO WAIT AT TABLE AND OTHERWISE ASSIST IN THE HOUSE
AND EVERY PART OF THE HARNESS SHOULD HAVE ITS PEG OR HOOK ONE FOR THE HALTERS ANOTHER FOR THE REINS AND OTHERS FOR SNAFFLES AND OTHER BITS AND METAL WORK
WITH REASONABLE EXERCISE WILL NOT BE THROWN AWAY AFTER THIS OPERATION ON REACHING HOME VERY HOT THE GROOM SHOULD WALK HIM ABOUT FOR A FEW MINUTES THIS DONE HE SHOULD TAKE OFF THE MOISTURE WITH THE SCRAPER
WHEN THE CARRIAGE RETURNS HOME IT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY WASHED AND DRIED AND THAT IF POSSIBLE BEFORE THE MUD HAS TIME TO DRY ON IT
THIS IS SOMETIMES ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF HOLLOW WALLS WITH GRATINGS AT THE BOTTOM OUTSIDE FOR THE EXIT OF BAD AIR WHICH IS CARRIED DOWN THROUGH THE HOLLOW WALLS AND DISCHARGED AT THE BOTTOM WHILE FOR THE ADMISSION OF FRESH AIR THE REVERSE TAKES PLACE
A SHORT TIME AFTERWARDS THEIR USUAL MORNING FEED OF OATS SHOULD BE PUT INTO THE MANGER WHILE THIS IS GOING ON THE STABLE BOY HAS BEEN REMOVING THE STABLE DUNG AND SWEEPING AND WASHING OUT THE STABLES
AND EITHER A WOODEN HORSE OR SADDLE TREES FOR THE SADDLES AND PADS ALL THESE PARTS SHOULD BE DRY CLEAN AND SHINING THIS IS ONLY TO BE DONE BY CAREFUL CLEANING AND POLISHING
AND A COACH HOUSE PERFECTLY DRY AND WELL VENTILATED FOR THE WOOD WORK SWELLS WITH MOISTURE IT SHRINKS ALSO WITH HEAT UNLESS THE TIMBER HAS UNDERGONE A LONG COURSE OF SEASONING IT SHOULD ALSO HAVE A DRY FLOOR
AND SO ALL OVER FROM THE KNEES AND BACK UPWARDS AFTER THAT GO TO THE FAR SIDE AND DO THAT LIKEWISE THEN TAKE A DEAD HORSE'S TAIL OR FAILING THAT A COTTON DUSTING CLOTH
THE ONE WITH PLATE POWDER OR WITH WELL WASHED WHITING MIXED WITH SWEET OIL AND LEATHER KEPT FOR THE PURPOSE THE OTHER WITH ROTTENSTONE MIXED WITH A LITTLE OIL AND APPLIED WITHOUT TOO MUCH RUBBING UNTIL THE PASTE IS REMOVED
IN THE CASE OF SADDLE HORSES HE WILL WALK TROT CANTER AND GALLOP THEM IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM UP TO THEIR WORK WITH DRAUGHT HORSES
FOR A YOUNG ONE IT DOES NO HARM AND LITTLE GOOD OATS SHOULD BE BRIGHT AND DRY AND NOT TOO NEW WHERE THEY ARE NEW SPRINKLE THEM WITH SALT AND WATER OTHERWISE THEY OVERLOAD THE HORSE'S STOMACH
AND EASILY PREVENTED THE HARNESS ROOM SHOULD HAVE A WOODEN LINING ALL ROUND AND BE PERFECTLY DRY AND WELL VENTILATED AROUND THE WALLS HOOKS AND PEGS SHOULD BE PLACED FOR THE SEVERAL PIECES OF HARNESS
SHAKING THE BOTTLE GENTLY UNTIL IT CEASES TO EMIT WHITE VAPOURS SEPARATE THE COAGULATED FROM THE LIQUID PART BY STRAINING THROUGH A SIEVE AND STORE IT AWAY TILL REQUIRED
THE DOORS ARE USUALLY SO ARRANGED THAT EVEN A LADY MAY LET HERSELF OUT IF SHE WISHES IT FROM THE INSIDE THE COACHMAN'S DUTIES ARE TO AVOID EVERYTHING APPROACHING AN ACCIDENT
SO AS TO REMOVE ALL GRAVEL AND DUST WHICH WILL SOMETIMES LIE IN THE BENDING OF THE JOINTS IN ADDITION TO THE PRACTICE OF THIS OLD WRITER MODERN GROOMS ADD WISPING WHICH USUALLY FOLLOWS BRUSHING
TAKE OFF THE BRIDLE AND CRUPPER AND FASTEN IT TO THE RACK THEN THE GIRTHS AND PUT A WISP OF STRAW UNDER THE SADDLE WHEN SUFFICIENTLY COOL THE HORSE SHOULD HAVE SOME HAY GIVEN HIM AND THEN A FEED OF OATS
ALTHOUGH SOME GROOMS INSIST ON A MUCH HIGHER TEMPERATURE
BY A HAIR CLOTH WITH WHICH RUB HIM ALL OVER AGAIN VERY HARD BOTH TO TAKE AWAY LOOSE HAIRS AND LAY HIS COAT THEN WASH YOUR HANDS IN FAIR WATER AND RUB HIM
AND RUB ALL HIS LEGS EXCEEDING WELL FROM THE KNEES AND HOCKS DOWNWARDS TO HIS HOOFS PICKING AND DRESSING THEM VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT THE FETLOCKS
IN PREPARING THE CARRIAGE FOR USE THE WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE RUBBED OVER WITH A CLEAN LEATHER AND CAREFULLY POLISHED THE IRON WORK AND JOINTS OILED THE PLATED AND BRASS WORK OCCASIONALLY CLEANED
THE BEST WISP IS MADE FROM A HAYBAND UNTWISTED AND AGAIN DOUBLED UP AFTER BEING MOISTENED WITH WATER THIS IS APPLIED TO EVERY PART OF THE BODY AS THE BRUSHING HAD BEEN
THE COACHMAN PROCEEDS TO THE OFF SIDE OF THE CARRIAGE TAKES THE REINS FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSES WHERE THEY WERE THROWN BUCKLES THEM TOGETHER AND PLACING HIS FOOT ON THE STEP ASCENDS TO HIS BOX
THE TRUE COACHMAN'S HANDS ARE SO DELICATE AND GENTLE THAT THE MERE WEIGHT OF THE REINS IS FELT ON THE BIT AND THE DIRECTIONS ARE INDICATED BY A TURN OF THE WRIST RATHER THAN BY A PULL
FOR IT IS WONDERFUL HOW SOON THESE ARE ACQUIRED BY SOME HORSES THE WRITER WAS ONCE EMPLOYED TO PURCHASE A HORSE FOR A COUNTRY FRIEND AND HE PICKED A VERY HANDSOME GELDING OUT OF COLLINS'S STABLES WHICH SEEMED TO ANSWER TO HIS FRIEND'S WANTS
THEN THE PACE WAS INDEED KILLING BUT THE TRUTH IS HORSES THAT ARE DRIVEN AT A JOG TROT PACE LOSE THAT ELAN WITH WHICH A GOOD DRIVER CAN INSPIRE THEM
IF THE LEATHER IS NOT BLACK ONE OR TWO COATS OF BLACK INK MAY BE GIVEN BEFORE APPLYING THE POLISH WHEN QUITE DRY THE VARNISH SHOULD BE LAID ON WITH A SOFT SHOE BRUSH
IN THESE CASES HE SHOULD HAVE THE MEANS OF DRESSING HIMSELF AND KEEPING HIS CLOTHES ENTIRELY AWAY FROM THE STABLES IN THE MORNING ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK OR RATHER BEFORE
HIS BELLY WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS FOOD BUT THE HORSE'S APPETITE IS NOT TO BE TAKEN AS A CRITERION OF THE QUANTITY OF FOOD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
STIRRING IT TILL COMPLETELY DISSOLVED INTO THIS POUR ONE POUNDS OF LITHARGE OF THE SHOPS WHICH HAS BEEN POUNDED UP WITH WATER AND DRIED AND SIFTED THROUGH A SIEVE LEAVING THE TWO WHEN MIXED
HAVING HIS HORSES NOW ENTIRELY UNDER CONTROL IN ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HE IS NOT EXPECTED TO DESCEND FOR WHERE NO FOOTMAN ACCOMPANIES THE CARRIAGE
IN APPLYING IT CLEAN THE LEATHER BY A WEAK SOLUTION OF OXALIC ACID WASHING IT OFF IMMEDIATELY
AS THE EASIEST MODE OF GETTING RID OF THE HORSE IT WAS SENT UP TO THE WRITER'S STABLES A PRESENT ONLY TWELVE MONTHS HAD ELAPSED THE HORSE WAS AS HANDSOME AS EVER WITH PLENTY OF FLESH AND A SLEEK GLOSSY COAT
WHEN THE LEATHER IS OLD AND GREASY IT SHOULD BE CLEANED BEFORE APPLYING THIS POLISH WITH A BRUSH WETTED IN A WEAK SOLUTION OF POTASS AND WATER WASHING AFTERWARDS WITH SOFT RIVER WATER AND DRYING THOROUGHLY
THE FAMILY CARRIAGE OF THE DAY BEING A MODIFIED FORM OF THE CLARENCE ADAPTED FOR FAMILY USE THE CARRIAGE IS A VALUABLE PIECE OF FURNITURE REQUIRING ALL THE CARE OF THE MOST DELICATE UPHOLSTERY
A GRATING SHOULD BE FIRMLY FIXED IN THE PAVEMENT AND IN COMMUNICATION WITH A WELL TRAPPED DRAIN TO CARRY OFF THE WATER THE GUTTER OUTSIDE THE STALL SHOULD ALSO COMMUNICATE WITH THE DRAINS BY TRAPPED OPENINGS
AND AFTERWARDS WISP HIM OVER WITH A HANDFUL OF STRAW AND A FLANNEL CLOTH IF THE CLOTH IS DIPPED IN SOME SPIRIT ALL THE BETTER HE SHOULD WASH PICK AND WIPE DRY THE LEGS AND FEET
CHOPPED STRAW MIXED WITH OATS IN THE PROPORTION OF A THIRD OF STRAW OR HAY IS A GOOD FOOD FOR HORSES IN FULL WORK AND CARROTS OF WHICH HORSES ARE REMARKABLY FOND HAVE A PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT IN A SHORT TIME
YOU CANNOT TAKE UP A PAPER WITHOUT HAVING THE QUESTION PUT DO YOU BRUISE YOUR OATS WELL THAT DEPENDS ON CIRCUMSTANCES A FRESH YOUNG HORSE CAN BRUISE ITS OWN OATS WHEN IT CAN GET THEM
SCENTING IT WITH ANY ESSENCE AT HAND THINNING IT WHEN NECESSARY FROM TIME TO TIME
SPONGES FOR HORSE AND CARRIAGE STABLE FORKS DUNG BASKETS OR WHEELBARROW CORN SIEVES AND MEASURES HORSE CLOTHS AND STABLE PAILS HORN OR GLASS LANTERNS
HIS INTEREST DICTATES THAT SO VALUABLE AN ANIMAL SHOULD BE WELL HOUSED WELL FED AND WELL GROOMED AND HE WILL DO WELL TO ACQUIRE SO MUCH OF STABLE LORE AS WILL ENABLE HIM TO JUDGE OF THESE POINTS HIMSELF
BAD FEEDING OR BAD GROOMING IT IS THEREFORE A POINT OF HUMANITY NOT TO SPEAK OF ITS OBVIOUS IMPOLICY FOR THE OWNER OF HORSES TO OVERLOOK ANY NEGLECT IN THEIR FEEDING OR GROOMING
HARNESS IF NOT CAREFULLY PRESERVED VERY SOON GETS A SHABBY TARNISHED APPEARANCE WHERE THE COACHMAN HAS A PROPER HARNESS ROOM AND SUFFICIENT ASSISTANCE THIS IS INEXCUSABLE
AT A JOG TROT OF FOUR MILES OR FOUR AND A HALF AND NOW NO PERSUASION OF THE WHIP COULD GET MORE OUT OF HIM AFTER MANY UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO BRING HIM BACK TO HIS PACE IN ONE OF WHICH A BREAK DOWN OCCURRED
IF VERY MUCH HARASSED WITH FATIGUE A LITTLE GOOD ALE OR WINE WILL BE WELL BESTOWED ON A VALUABLE HORSE
WITH UNERRING REGULARITY TWENTY SEVEN HOURS TO A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILES WHEN THE QUICKSILVER MAIL WAS TIMED TO ELEVEN MILES AN HOUR BETWEEN LONDON AND PLYMOUTH
THE WATER GIVEN TO A HORSE MERITS SOME ATTENTION IT SHOULD NOT BE TOO COLD HARD WATER IS NOT TO BE RECOMMENDED STAGNANT OR MUDDY WATER IS POSITIVELY INJURIOUS
IN CHOOSING HIS HORSES EVERY MASTER WILL SEE THAT THEY ARE PROPERLY PAIRED THAT THEIR PACES ARE ABOUT EQUAL WHEN THEIR HABITS DIFFER IT IS THE COACHMAN'S DUTY TO DISCOVER HOW HE CAN WITH LEAST ANNOYANCE TO THE HORSES
IF HE REFUSE THE LATTER OFFER HIM A LITTLE WET BRAN OR A HANDFUL OF OATMEAL IN TEPID WATER WHEN HE HAS BEEN FED HE SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY CLEANED AND HIS BODY CLOTHES PUT ON
FEEDING MUST DEPEND ON THEIR WORK BUT THEY REQUIRE FEEDING THREE TIMES A DAY WITH MORE OR LESS CORN EACH TIME ACCORDING TO THEIR WORK IN THE FAST COACHING DAYS IT WAS A SAYING AMONG PROPRIETORS THAT
WARM WITH GOOD VENTILATION AND PERFECTLY FREE FROM COLD DRAUGHTS THE STALLS ROOMY WITHOUT EXCESS WITH GOOD AND WELL TRAPPED DRAINAGE SO AS TO EXCLUDE BAD SMELLS
BUT I SAW IT WAS THE LAW OF NATURE THAT THIS SHOULD BE AND THAT IT WAS FOR THE MAID'S HAPPINESS THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE A HOME WHEN I WAS GONE AND I MADE UP MY MIND WITHOUT A MURMUR TO HELP IT ON FOR HER SAKE
AND SHE WAS DELICATELY REARED ANOTHER MAN CAME AND PAID COURT TO HER ONE HER EQUAL IN BREEDING AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN EVERY WAY IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE ONLY COULD GIVE HER THE HOME WHICH HER TRAINING HAD MADE A NECESSITY ALMOST
SO ALSO DO THESE WITHSTAND THE TRUTH MEN CORRUPTED IN MIND
AND WHENEVER HE HAD A HOLIDAY HE USED TO EXPEND AN AMOUNT OF LABOR AND INGENUITY IN THE PURSUIT OF WOODCHUCKS THAT WOULD HAVE MADE HIS FOR TUNE IN ANY USEFUL PURSUIT THERE WAS A HILL PASTURE DOWN ON ONE SIDE OF WHICH RAN A SMALL BROOK AND THIS PASTURE WAS FULL OF WOODCHUCK HOLES
PAUL AN APOSTLE OF JESUS CHRIST BY THE WILL OF GOD ACCORDING TO THE PROMISE OF LIFE WHICH IS IN CHRIST JESUS
AND NOT MOVED AWAY FROM THE HOPE OF THE GOSPEL WHICH YE HEARD WHICH WAS PREACHED IN THE WHOLE CREATION WHICH IS UNDER HEAVEN
THE POOR CREATURE WOULD DISAPPEAR IN THE WATER IN TERROR BUT HE MUST BREATHE AND OUT WOULD COME HIS NOSE AGAIN NEARER THE DOG EACH TIME AT LAST THE WATER RAN OUT OF THE HOLE AS WELL AS IN AND THE SOAKED BEAST CAME WITH IT AND MADE A DESPERATE RUSH
FORSOOK ME HAVING LOVED THE PRESENT WORLD
AND WHEN HE CEASED SPEAKING SHE SAID WITH HURRIED HOT BREATH WHAT HAS LED YOU TO THINK THIS OF ME WHO SAYS I HAVE WON YOUR DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND AWAY FROM HER SOME MONSTROUS CALUMNIES ARE AFLOAT OF WHICH I HAVE KNOWN NOTHING UNTIL NOW MELBURY STARTED AND LOOKED AT HER SIMPLY
HE BEGAN TO LOOK PALE AND ILL WHEREUPON THE BUTLER WHO CAME IN ASKED HIM TO HAVE A GLASS OF WINE MELBURY ROUSED HIMSELF AND SAID NO NO IS SHE ALMOST READY SHE IS JUST FINISHING BREAKFAST SAID THE BUTLER
AND CALLED US WITH A HOLY CALLING NOT ACCORDING TO OUR WORKS
NOW IN A SMOOTH AMBER CURRENT NOW FRETTED BY THE PEBBLES BUT ALWAYS WITH THAT CONTINUOUS BUSY SONG JOHN NEVER KNEW THAT NOISE TO CEASE AND HE DOUBTED NOT IF HE STAYED HERE A THOUSAND YEARS THAT SAME LOUD MURMUR WOULD FILL THE AIR
THE TEETH OF THE ENEMY WENT THROUGH THE CLOTH AND MET AND THERE HE HUNG JOHN THEN MADE A PIVOT OF ONE LEG AND WHIRLED HIMSELF AROUND SWINGING THE WOODCHUCK IN THE AIR UNTIL HE SHOOK HIM OFF BUT IN HIS DEPARTURE THE WOODCHUCK CARRIED AWAY A LARGE PIECE OF JOHN'S SUMMER TROUSERS LEG THE BOY NEVER FORGOT IT
I USED THE WORD AROMATIC IN RELATION TO THE NEW ENGLAND SOIL JOHN KNEW VERY WELL ALL ITS SWEET AROMATIC PUNGENT AND MEDICINAL PRODUCTS AND LIKED TO SEARCH FOR THE SCENTED HERBS AND THE WILD FRUITS AND EXQUISITE FLOWERS
MISSUS CHARMOND LOOKED ILL AT EASE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEGUN TO GUESS HIS MEANING BUT APART FROM THAT SHE HAD SUCH DREAD OF CONTACT WITH ANYTHING PAINFUL HARSH OR EVEN EARNEST THAT HIS PRELIMINARIES ALONE WERE ENOUGH TO DISTRESS HER YES WHAT IS IT
HE BORE A SPECIAL GRUDGE AGAINST THIS CLOVER EATER BEYOND THE USUAL HOSTILITY THAT BOYS FEEL FOR ANY WILD ANIMAL ONE DAY ON HIS WAY TO SCHOOL A WOODCHUCK CROSSED THE ROAD BEFORE HIM AND JOHN GAVE CHASE THE WOODCHUCK SCRAMBLED INTO AN ORCHARD AND CLIMBED A SMALL APPLE TREE
WITH A FAINTNESS WHICH SUGGESTED A GUILTY CONSCIENCE THIS IS SO UTTERLY UNEXPECTED YOU OBTAIN ADMISSION TO MY PRESENCE BY MISREPRESENTATION AS GOD'S IN HEAVEN MA'AM THAT'S NOT TRUE I MADE NO PRETENCE AND I THOUGHT IN REASON YOU WOULD KNOW WHY I HAD COME
THROUGH THIS VISION THE INCIDENTS OF THE MOMENT BUT GLEAMED CONFUSEDLY HERE AND THERE AS AN OUTER LANDSCAPE THROUGH THE HIGH COLORED SCENES OF A STAINED WINDOW HE WAITED THUS AN HOUR AN HOUR AND A HALF TWO HOURS
IF ANY CAME PLODDING THOUGHTFULLY ONWARD HE CROSSED A GLADE LYING BETWEEN LITTLE HINTOCK WOODS AND THE PLANTATION WHICH ABUTTED ON THE PARK AND THE SPOT BEING OPEN HE WAS DISCERNED THERE BY WINTERBORNE FROM THE COPSE ON THE NEXT HILL WHERE HE AND HIS MEN WERE WORKING
CAUSED HER GRAVE MISGIVINGS DO SIT DOWN MISTER MELBURY YOU HAVE FELLED ALL THE TREES THAT WERE TO BE PURCHASED BY YOU THIS SEASON EXCEPT THE OAKS I BELIEVE YES SAID MELBURY HOW VERY NICE
THERE BEING NO FIRE IN THE ROOM SHE CAME IN WITH A SHAWL THROWN LOOSELY ROUND HER SHOULDERS AND OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT THE LEAST SUSPICION THAT MELBURY HAD CALLED UPON ANY OTHER ERRAND THAN TIMBER
HAD A STRANGE ASPECT AND WAS LIKE SOME TOWN IN A BOOK SAY A VILLAGE NESTLED IN THE SWISS MOUNTAINS OR SOMETHING IN BOHEMIA AND THERE BEYOND THE PURPLE HILLS OF BOZRAH AND NOT SO FAR AS THE STONY PASTURES OF ZOAH
TO WHOM BE THE GLORY FOREVER AND EVER
WAS BEING SLOWLY INVADED BY A DELIRIUM WHICH HAD BROUGHT ABOUT ALL THIS THAT SHE WAS LOSING JUDGMENT AND DIGNITY UNDER IT BECOMING AN ANIMATED IMPULSE ONLY A PASSION INCARNATE A FASCINATION HAD LED HER ON IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN SEIZED BY A HAND OF VELVET
THOROUGHLY FURNISHED UNTO ALL GOOD WORKS
BUT BE GENTLE TOWARD ALL APT IN TEACHING
WHICH DWELT FIRST IN THY GRANDMOTHER LOIS AND THY MOTHER EUNICE
THAT THE TOSSING FOREST BEHIND HIM WAS THE HEAVING WAVES OF THE SEA AND THAT THE WIND WHICH MOANED OVER THE WOODS AND MURMURED IN THE LEAVES AND NOW AND THEN SENT HIM A WIDE CIRCUIT IN THE AIR AS IF HE HAD BEEN A BLACKBIRD ON THE TIP TOP OF A SPRUCE WAS AN OCEAN GALE
SAVE THIS ROAR NO SOUND REACHED HIM EXCEPT NOW AND THEN THE RUMBLE OF A WAGON ON THE BRIDGE OR THE MUFFLED FAR OFF VOICES OF SOME CHANCE PASSERS ON THE ROAD SEEN FROM THIS HIGH PERCH THE FAMILIAR VILLAGE SENDING ITS BROWN ROOFS AND WHITE SPIRES UP THROUGH THE GREEN FOLIAGE
THESE OF HER HOUSEHOLD PREFERRED TO REGARD THEIR MISTRESS AS THE DEEPER SINNER MELBURY SAT WITH HIS HANDS RESTING ON THE FAMILIAR KNOBBED THORN WALKING STICK WHOSE GROWING HE HAD SEEN BEFORE HE ENJOYED ITS USE
SOMETIMES IT SEEMED AS IF THE HOLE WAS A BOTTOMLESS PIT BUT SOONER OR LATER THE WATER WOULD RISE IN IT AND THEN THERE WAS SURE TO BE SEEN THE NOSE OF THE WOODCHUCK KEEPING ITSELF ON A LEVEL WITH THE RISING FLOOD IT WAS PITEOUS TO SEE THE ANXIOUS LOOK OF THE HUNTED HALF DROWNED CREATURE AS
BUT YOU WERE WITHIN YOUR RIGHT AS THE SUPERIOR NO DOUBT BUT IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER HER POSITION NOW SURELY SURELY YOU WOULD DO HER NO HARM CERTAINLY I WOULD DO HER NO HARM I MELBURY'S EYE MET HERS
IT WAS CURIOUS BUT THE ALLUSION TO GRACE'S FORMER LOVE FOR HER SEEMED TO TOUCH HER MORE THAN ALL MELBURY'S OTHER ARGUMENTS OH MELBURY SHE BURST OUT YOU HAVE MADE ME SO UNHAPPY HOW COULD YOU COME TO ME LIKE THIS IT IS TOO DREADFUL NOW GO AWAY GO GO
THEY INTERFERED IN THE INTEREST OF PEACE AND THE BALANCE OF POWER AND KILLED THE WOODCHUCK THIS IS A BOY'S NOTION OF JUSTICE OF COURSE HE'D NO BUSINESS TO BE A WOODCHUCK AN UNSPEAKABLE WOODCHUCK
WHEN THOU COMEST BRING AND THE BOOKS
IT CAME TO THE SURFACE AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE DOG THERE THE DOG STOOD AT THE MOUTH OF THE HOLE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT FROM HIS NOSE TO THE TIP OF HIS TAIL AND BEHIND HIM WERE THE CRUEL BOYS DANCING WITH JOY AND SETTING THE DOG ON
AND GOT TO BE A REAL GOVERNOR WHO ALSO USED TO BE SENT TO CUT BRUSH IN THE BACK PASTURES AND HATED IT IN HIS VERY SOUL AND BY HIS WRONG CONDUCT FORECAST WHAT KIND OF A MAN HE WOULD BE THIS BOY AS SOON AS HE HAD CUT ABOUT ONE BRUSH WOULD SEEK FOR ONE OF SEVERAL HOLES IN THE GROUND
BUT IN A TRICE THE DOG HAD HIM AND THE BOYS STOOD OFF IN A CIRCLE WITH STONES IN THEIR HANDS TO SEE WHAT THEY CALLED FAIR PLAY THEY MAINTAINED PERFECT NEUTRALITY SO LONG AS THE DOG WAS GETTING THE BEST OF THE WOODCHUCK BUT IF THE LATTER WAS LIKELY TO ESCAPE
THE THINGS IN THE HEAVENS AND THE THINGS ON THE EARTH THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE WHETHER THRONES OR DOMINIONS OR PRINCIPALITIES OR POWERS
THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS
KNOWING HIS MISSION THE YOUNGER MAN HASTENED DOWN FROM THE COPSE AND MANAGED TO INTERCEPT THE TIMBER MERCHANT I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF THIS SIR HE SAID AND I AM OF OPINION THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO PUT OFF YOUR VISIT FOR THE PRESENT
STRIVING ACCORDING TO HIS WORKING WHICH WORKS IN ME WITH POWER
MINGLED WITH BETTER SENTIMENTS MISSUS CHARMOND'S MOBILE SPIRIT WAS SUBJECT TO THESE FIERCE PERIODS OF STRESS AND STORM SHE HAD NEVER SO CLEARLY PERCEIVED TILL NOW THAT HER SOUL
THAT EXCITES THE IMAGINATION WITHOUT SATISFYING IT AND BEGETS THE DESIRE OF ADVENTURE AND THE PROSAIC LIFE OF THE SWEET HOME DOES NOT AT ALL CORRESPOND TO THE BOY'S DREAMS OF THE WORLD IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS I AM TOLD THE BOYS ON THE COAST RAN AWAY AND BECAME SAILORS
IT WAS FIRST NECESSARY BY PATIENT WATCHING TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE WOODCHUCK WAS AT HOME WHEN ONE WAS SEEN TO ENTER HIS BURROW THEN ALL THE ENTRIES TO IT EXCEPT ONE THERE ARE USUALLY THREE WERE PLUGGED UP WITH STONES
THE COUNTRYBOYS WAITED TILL THEY GREW BIG ENOUGH TO BE MISSIONARIES AND THEN THEY SAILED AWAY AND MET THE COAST BOYS IN FOREIGN PORTS
EUBULUS SALUTES THEE
SHE WILL SOON SEE YOU NOW I AM JUST GOING UP TO TELL HER YOU ARE HERE WHAT HAVEN'T YOU TOLD HER BEFORE SAID MELBURY OH NO SAID THE OTHER YOU SEE YOU CAME SO VERY EARLY AT LAST THE BELL RANG MISSUS CHARMOND COULD SEE HIM
FEARING THAT THEY MIGHT ENTREAT HIM TO ABANDON SO RISKY A PROJECT AND WENT OUT UNOBSERVED HE HAD CHOSEN HIS TIME WITH A VIEW AS HE SUPPOSED OF CONVENIENTLY CATCHING MISSUS CHARMOND WHEN SHE HAD JUST FINISHED HER BREAKFAST BEFORE ANY OTHER BUSINESS PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABOUT
BUT SURELY MA'AM YOU KNOW THE TRUTH BETTER THAN I HER FEATURES BECAME A LITTLE PINCHED AND THE TOUCHES OF POWDER ON HER HANDSOME FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOWED THEMSELVES AS AN EXTRINSIC FILM WILL YOU LEAVE ME TO MYSELF SHE SAID
AND YET URGES HIM AWAY FROM ALL THE SWEET DELIGHTS OF HIS HOME TO BECOME A ROAMER IN LITERATURE AND IN THE WORLD A POET AND A WANDERER THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE SOIL AND THE PURE AIR I SUSPECT THAT PROMISES MORE ROMANCE THAN IS FORTHCOMING
FELICE WAS INDEED THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE PARISH WHO HAD NOT HEARD THE RUMOR OF HER OWN WEAKNESSES SHE WAS AT THIS MOMENT LIVING IN A FOOL'S PARADISE IN RESPECT OF THAT RUMOR THOUGH NOT IN RESPECT OF THE WEAKNESSES THEMSELVES WHICH IF THE TRUTH BE TOLD
AND HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH SEVERAL IN WHICH LIVED A WHITE AND BLACK ANIMAL THAT MUST ALWAYS BE NAMELESS IN A BOOK BUT AN ANIMAL QUITE CAPABLE OF THE MOST PUNGENT DEFENSE OF HIMSELF THIS YOUNG ASPIRANT TO CONGRESS WOULD CUT A LONG STICK WITH A LITTLE CROTCH IN THE END OF IT
WHITHER JOHN HAD HELPED DRIVE THE COLTS AND YOUNG STOCK IN THE SPRING MIGHT BE PERHAPS JERUSALEM ITSELF JOHN HAD HIMSELF ONCE BEEN TO THE LAND OF CANAAN WITH HIS GRANDFATHER WHEN HE WAS A VERY SMALL BOY AND HE HAD ONCE SEEN AN ACTUAL NO MISTAKE JEW
WHAT THINGS CAME UPON ME AT ANTIOCH AT ICONIUM AT LYSTRA WHAT PERSECUTIONS I ENDURED
BUT HE WALKED ABOUT THE PAVED COURT TILL HE WAS TIRED AND STILL NOBODY CAME TO HIM AT LAST HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND SAT DOWN IN A SMALL WAITING ROOM FROM WHICH HE GOT GLIMPSES OF THE KITCHEN CORRIDOR AND OF THE WHITE CAPPED MAIDS FLITTING JAUNTILY HITHER AND THITHER
TO THE COMPARATIVELY BARREN ORIENT AS THE LAND OF SWEET SMELLING SPICES AND ODOROUS GUMS AND IT IS INDEED A CONSTANT SURPRISE THAT THIS POOR AND STONY SOIL ELABORATES AND GROWS SO MANY DELICATE AND AROMATIC PRODUCTS
HE WAS THE MORE IMPELLED TO GO AT ONCE BY THE ABSENCE OF HIS SON IN LAW IN LONDON FOR A FEW DAYS TO ATTEND REALLY OR OSTENSIBLY SOME PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS HE SAID NOTHING OF HIS DESTINATION EITHER TO HIS WIFE OR TO GRACE
HE WOULD INDUSTRIOUSLY GO HOME AS INNOCENT AS ANYBODY THERE ARE FEW SUCH BOYS AS THIS NOWADAYS AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY THE NEW ENGLAND PASTURES ARE SO MUCH OVERGROWN WITH BRUSH JOHN HIMSELF PREFERRED TO HUNT THE PUGNACIOUS WOODCHUCK
THIS GOSSIP I HAVE HEARD NOTHING OF IT TELL ME OF IT I SAY TELL YOU MA'AM NOT I WHAT THE GOSSIP IS NO MATTER WHAT REALLY IS YOU KNOW
AND IN HOW MANY THINGS HE MINISTERED TO ME AT EPHESUS THOU KNOWEST VERY WELL
BOASTERS PROUD BLASPHEMERS DISOBEDIENT TO PARENTS UNTHANKFUL
A BELOVED CHILD GRACE MERCY PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER
AND THE CHILD BECAME PRECIOUS AS THE APPLE OF MY EYE TO ME FOR SHE WAS ALL I HAD LEFT TO LOVE FOR HER SAKE ENTIRELY I MARRIED AS SECOND WIFE A HOMESPUN WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN KIND AS A MOTHER TO HER IN DUE TIME THE QUESTION OF HER EDUCATION CAME ON AND I SAID
THE BOY WOULD TAKE TO HIS HEELS AND LEAVE THE TWO TO FIGHT IT OUT CONTENT TO SCENT THE BATTLE AFAR OFF AND THIS BOY WHO WAS IN TRAINING FOR PUBLIC LIFE WOULD DO THIS SORT OF THING ALL THE AFTERNOON AND WHEN THE SUN TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD SPENT LONG ENOUGH TIME CUTTING BRUSH
I WILL EDUCATE THE MAID WELL IF I LIVE UPON BREAD TO DO IT OF HER POSSIBLE MARRIAGE I COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK FOR IT SEEMED LIKE A DEATH THAT SHE SHOULD CLEAVE TO ANOTHER MAN AND GROW TO THINK HIS HOUSE HER HOME RATHER THAN MINE
A BOY AND A DOG WERE THEN LEFT TO WATCH THE OPEN HOLE WHILE JOHN AND HIS COMRADES WENT TO THE BROOK AND BEGAN TO DIG A CANAL TO TURN THE WATER INTO THE RESIDENCE OF THE WOODCHUCK THIS WAS OFTEN A DIFFICULT FEAT OF ENGINEERING AND A LONG JOB
BUT PARDON ME I SPEAK ROUGHLY AND I CAME TO SPEAK GENTLY TO COAX YOU BEG YOU TO BE MY DAUGHTER'S FRIEND SHE LOVED YOU ONCE MA'AM YOU BEGAN BY LIKING HER THEN YOU DROPPED HER WITHOUT A REASON AND IT HURT HER WARM HEART MORE THAN I CAN TELL YE
A MYSTERIOUS PERSON WITH UNCUT BEARD AND LONG HAIR WHO SOLD SCYTHE SNATHS IN THAT REGION AND ABOUT WHOM THERE WAS A RUMOR THAT HE WAS ONCE CAUGHT AND SHAVED BY THE INDIGNANT FARMERS WHO APPREHENDED IN HIS LONG LOCKS A CONTEMPT OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
GOD'S FIRM FOUNDATION STANDS HAVING THIS SEAL THE LORD KNEW THOSE WHO ARE HIS AND
BRINGING FORTH FRUIT IN EVERY GOOD WORK
WERE UTTERED WITH A PERFUNCTORINESS THAT MADE THEM SOUND ABSURDLY UNREAL YES YES SAID MELBURY IN A REVERIE HE DID NOT TAKE A CHAIR AND SHE ALSO REMAINED STANDING RESTING UPON HIS STICK HE BEGAN MISSUS CHARMOND
SHE WAS NOT IN HER PRIVATE SITTING ROOM WHEN HE REACHED IT BUT IN A MINUTE HE HEARD HER COMING FROM THE FRONT STAIRCASE AND SHE ENTERED WHERE HE STOOD AT THIS TIME OF THE MORNING MISSUS CHARMOND LOOKED HER FULL AGE AND MORE SHE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR THE TYPICAL
THAT THROUGH ME THE PREACHING MIGHT BE FULLY ACCOMPLISHED AND ALL THE GENTILES MIGHT HEAR
BUT MELBURY WOULD NOT EVEN STOP TO HEAR HIM HIS MIND WAS MADE UP THE APPEAL WAS TO BE MADE AND WINTERBORNE STOOD AND WATCHED HIM SADLY TILL HE ENTERED THE SECOND PLANTATION AND DISAPPEARED
TAKE MARK AND BRING HIM WITH THEE
FOR IF WE DIED WITH HIM
AND ALL WHO DESIRE TO LIVE GODLY IN CHRIST JESUS
PAUL REMEMBER MY BONDS GRACE BE WITH YOU
THERE ARE NOT ONLY VESSELS OF GOLD AND OF SILVER
BETWEEN THEMSELVES SHE WAS IN BED AND ASLEEP NEVER MIND SAID MELBURY RETREATING INTO THE COURT I'LL STAND ABOUT HERE CHARGED SO FULLY WITH HIS MISSION HE SHRANK FROM CONTACT WITH ANYBODY
AS IF THERE WERE NO BETTER USE FOR A WARRIOR AND A POET IN NEW ENGLAND THAN TO SEND HIM FOR THE COWS JOHN KNEW A BOY A BAD ENOUGH BOY I DARESAY WHO AFTERWARDS BECAME A GENERAL IN THE WAR AND WENT TO CONGRESS
MANNER OF LIFE PURPOSE FAITH LONG SUFFERING LOVE
IN WHICH EVENT HIS POSITION WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT ONE FOR OBSERVATION AND FOR SAFETY WHILE HE WAS IN THE HEIGHT OF THIS ENGAGEMENT PERHAPS THE HORN WOULD BE BLOWN FROM THE BACK PORCH REMINDING HIM THAT IT WAS TIME TO QUIT CUTTING BRUSH AND GO FOR THE COWS
SANCTIFIED USEFUL FOR THE MASTER
NO ONE CAME FORWARD WITH ME BUT ALL FORSOOK ME
IT MUST BE SO CHARMING TO WORK IN THE WOODS JUST NOW SHE WAS TOO CARELESS TO AFFECT AN INTEREST IN AN EXTRANEOUS PERSON'S AFFAIRS SO CONSUMMATELY AS TO DECEIVE IN THE MANNER OF THE PERFECT SOCIAL MACHINE HENCE HER WORDS VERY NICE SO CHARMING
PERHAPS TURKS AND BANNERS OF RED AND OF YELLOW ADVANCE AND A CANNON WHEEL ABOUT AND POINT ITS LONG NOSE AND OPEN ON THE VALLEY HE FANCIED THE ARMY AFTER THIS SALUTE WINDING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ROAD DEPLOYING IN THE MEADOWS AND GIVING THE VALLEY TO PILLAGE AND TO FLAME
BUT DENYING THE POWER THEREOF AND FROM THESE
HAVING MADE PEACE THROUGH THE BLOOD OF HIS CROSS THROUGH HIM WHETHER THE THINGS ON THE EARTH
THERE IS EVERYTHING IN THE HEART OF THE NEW ENGLAND HILLS TO FEED THE IMAGINATION OF THE BOY AND EXCITE HIS LONGING FOR STRANGE COUNTRIES I SCARCELY KNOW WHAT THE SUBTLE INFLUENCE IS THAT FORMS HIM AND ATTRACTS HIM IN THE MOST FASCINATING AND AROMATIC OF ALL LANDS
JOHN THOUGHT THIS A MOST COWARDLY AND UNFAIR RETREAT AND STOOD UNDER THE TREE AND TAUNTED THE ANIMAL AND STONED IT THEREUPON THE WOODCHUCK DROPPED DOWN ON JOHN AND SEIZED HIM BY THE LEG OF HIS TROUSERS JOHN WAS BOTH ENRAGED AND SCARED BY THIS DASTARDLY ATTACK
WHAT LIFE AND ACTION AND HEROISM THERE WAS TO HIM IN THE MULTITUDINOUS ROAR OF THE FOREST AND WHAT AN ETERNITY OF EXISTENCE IN THE MONOLOGUE OF THE RIVER WHICH BRAWLED FAR FAR BELOW HIM OVER ITS WIDE STONY BED HOW THE RIVER SPARKLED AND DANCED AND WENT ON
SHE SAID I AM AN OLD MAN SAID MELBURY WHOM SOMEWHAT LATE IN LIFE GOD THOUGHT FIT TO BLESS WITH ONE CHILD AND SHE A DAUGHTER HER MOTHER WAS A VERY DEAR WIFE TO ME BUT SHE WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US WHEN THE CHILD WAS YOUNG
BUT HE DID NOT THEN KNOW AND FEW DO KNOW THAT THERE IS NO PART OF THE GLOBE WHERE THE SUBTLE CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH PRODUCES MORE THAT IS AGREEABLE TO THE SENSES THAN A NEW ENGLAND HILL PASTURE AND THE GREEN MEADOW AT ITS FOOT THE POETS HAVE SUCCEEDED IN TURNING OUR ATTENTION FROM IT
JOHN IT IS TRUE DID NOT CARE MUCH FOR ANYTHING THAT DID NOT APPEAL TO HIS TASTE AND SMELL AND DELIGHT IN BRILLIANT COLOR AND HE TROD DOWN THE EXQUISITE FERNS AND THE WONDERFUL MOSSES WITHOUT COMPUNCTION
I URGED HER ON AND SHE MARRIED HIM BUT MA'AM A FATAL MISTAKE WAS AT THE ROOT OF MY RECKONING I FOUND THAT THIS WELL BORN GENTLEMAN I HAD CALCULATED ON SO SURELY WAS NOT STANCH OF HEART AND THAT THEREIN LAY A DANGER OF GREAT SORROW FOR MY DAUGHTER
EVEN UNTO BONDS AS AN EVIL DOER
OFTEN IT TOOK MORE THAN HALF A DAY OF HARD LABOR WITH SHOVEL AND HOE TO DIG THE CANAL BUT WHEN THE CANAL WAS FINISHED AND THE WATER BEGAN TO POUR INTO THE HOLE THE EXCITEMENT BEGAN HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO FILL THE HOLE AND DROWN OUT THE WOODCHUCK
WHEN HE HAD GRUBBED UP A FEW LAURELS AND YOUNG TREE SPROUTS HE WAS WONT TO RETIRE INTO HIS FAVORITE POST OF OBSERVATION AND MEDITATION PERHAPS HE FANCIED THAT THE WIDE SWAYING STEM TO WHICH HE CLUNG WAS THE MAST OF A SHIP
THE HEART OF NEW ENGLAND IT IS A WONDER THAT EVERY NEW ENGLAND BOY DOES NOT TURN OUT A POET OR A MISSIONARY OR A PEDDLER MOST OF THEM USED TO
IMPLACABLE FALSE ACCUSERS INCONTINENT FIERCE
AND RUN IT INTO THE HOLE AND WHEN THE CROTCH WAS PUNCHED INTO THE FUR AND SKIN OF THE ANIMAL HE WOULD TWIST THE STICK ROUND TILL IT GOT A GOOD GRIP ON THE SKIN AND THEN HE WOULD PULL THE BEAST OUT AND WHEN HE GOT THE WHITE AND BLACK JUST OUT OF THE HOLE SO THAT HIS DOG COULD SEIZE HIM
THERE IS LAID UP FOR ME THE CROWN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH THE LORD THE RIGHTEOUS JUDGE WILL GIVE ME IN THAT DAY AND NOT TO ME ONLY
FOR THEIR FOLLY SHALL BE FULLY MANIFEST TO ALL
FOR IT IS NOT AS IF YOU WOULD LOSE BY SO DOING YOUR COURSE IS FAR HIGHER THAN THE COURSES OF A SIMPLE PROFESSIONAL MAN AND THE GRATITUDE YOU WOULD WIN FROM ME AND MINE BY YOUR KINDNESS IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY
THAT ALL THOSE IN ASIA TURNED AWAY FROM ME
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO AT NINE O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING MELBURY DRESSED HIMSELF UP IN SHINING BROADCLOTH CREASED WITH FOLDING AND SMELLING OF CAMPHOR AND STARTED FOR HINTOCK HOUSE
OH THE WORLD HAD VAST POSSIBILITIES FOR JOHN AWAY TO THE SOUTH UP A VAST BASIN OF FOREST THERE WAS A NOTCH IN THE HORIZON AND AN OPENING IN THE LINE OF WOODS WHERE THE ROAD RAN THROUGH THIS OPENING JOHN IMAGINED AN ARMY MIGHT APPEAR PERHAPS BRITISH
AND THIS WAS WHERE SHE FOUND HERSELF OVERSHADOWED WITH SUDDEN NIGHT AS IF A TORNADO HAD PASSED BY WHILE SHE SAT OR RATHER CROUCHED UNHINGED BY THE INTERVIEW LUNCH TIME CAME AND THEN THE EARLY AFTERNOON ALMOST WITHOUT HER CONSCIOUSNESS
THE SECOND LETTER OF PAUL TO TIMOTHY
MISSUS CHARMOND HAD FIRST RUSHED INTO A MOOD OF INDIGNATION ON COMPREHENDING MELBURY'S STORY HOT AND COLD BY TURNS SHE HAD MURMURED LEAVE ME LEAVE ME BUT AS HE SEEMED TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF THIS HIS WORDS BEGAN TO INFLUENCE HER
APPLY THYSELF IN SEASON OUT OF SEASON REPROVE REBUKE
ON IT WENT UNDER THE WIDE SPANS OF THE OLD WOODEN COVERED BRIDGE SWIRLING AROUND THE GREAT ROCKS ON WHICH THE PIERS STOOD SPREADING AWAY BELOW IN SHALLOWS AND TAKING THE SHADOWS OF A ROW OF MAPLES THAT LINED THE GREEN SHORE
MADAM HE SAW YOU AND YOU KNOW THE REST I HAVE COME TO MAKE NO DEMANDS TO UTTER NO THREATS I HAVE COME SIMPLY AS A FATHER IN GREAT GRIEF ABOUT THIS ONLY CHILD AND I BESEECH YOU TO DEAL KINDLY WITH MY DAUGHTER
AND TO DO NOTHING WHICH CAN TURN HER HUSBAND'S HEART AWAY FROM HER FOREVER FORBID HIM YOUR PRESENCE MA'AM AND SPEAK TO HIM ON HIS DUTY AS ONE WITH YOUR POWER OVER HIM WELL CAN DO AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT THE RENT BETWEEN THEM MAY BE PATCHED UP
AND FAITHFUL BRETHREN IN CHRIST
WE SHALL ALSO REIGN WITH HIM IF WE SHALL DENY HIM
BUT I AM NOT ASHAMED FOR I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED AND AM PERSUADED THAT HE IS ABLE TO KEEP THAT WHICH I HAVE COMMITTED TO HIM
THEY HAD HEARD OF HIS ARRIVAL BUT HAD NOT SEEN HIM ENTER AND IMAGINING HIM STILL IN THE COURT DISCUSSED FREELY THE POSSIBLE REASON OF HIS CALLING THEY MARVELLED AT HIS TEMERITY FOR THOUGH MOST OF THE TONGUES WHICH HAD BEEN LET LOOSE ATTRIBUTED THE CHIEF BLAME WORTHINESS TO FITZPIERS
THEN A STRANGE GENTLEMAN WHO SAYS IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GIVE HIS NAME WAS SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED I CANNOT SEE HIM WHOEVER HE MAY BE I AM NOT AT HOME TO ANYBODY
I HAVE FINISHED MY COURSE
HE WAS SENT TO MAKE WAR ON THE BUSHES THAT CONSTANTLY ENCROACHED UPON THE PASTURELAND BUT JOHN HAD NO HOSTILITY TO ANY GROWING THING AND A VERY LITTLE BUSHWHACKING SATISFIED HIM
MELBURY RANG AT THE TRADESMEN'S DOOR OF THE MANOR HOUSE AND WAS AT ONCE INFORMED THAT THE LADY WAS NOT YET VISIBLE AS INDEED HE MIGHT HAVE GUESSED HAD HE BEEN ANYBODY BUT THE MAN HE WAS MELBURY SAID HE WOULD WAIT WHEREUPON THE YOUNG MAN INFORMED HIM IN A NEIGHBORLY WAY THAT
AND TO MAKE AMENDS I DETERMINED TO GIVE HER MY MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION TO MY FRIEND'S SON SEEING THAT THEY LIKED EACH OTHER WELL THINGS CAME ABOUT WHICH MADE ME DOUBT IF IT WOULD BE FOR MY DAUGHTER'S HAPPINESS TO DO THIS INASMUCH AS THE YOUNG MAN WAS POOR
I HAVE CALLED UPON A MORE SERIOUS MATTER AT LEAST TO ME THAN TREE THROWING AND WHATEVER MISTAKES I MAKE IN MY MANNER OF SPEAKING UPON IT TO YOU MADAM DO ME THE JUSTICE TO SET EM DOWN TO MY WANT OF PRACTICE AND NOT TO MY WANT OF CARE
OUR TWO PRINCES FOR THE THIRD ONE HAS DISAPPEARED HAVE BROUGHT AWAY BRIDES FROM THE OTHER WORLD AND WANT TO MARRY THEM BUT THOSE BRIDES REFUSE FOR THEY INSIST ON HAVING ALL THEIR WEDDING CLOTHES MADE FOR THEM FIRST
PRESENTLY HE CAME UP WITH THE BEAST AND THEY BEGAN A FIGHT THEY FOUGHT AND FOUGHT THE PRINCE GAVE THE BEAST THREE WOUNDS AT LAST THEY WERE BOTH UTTERLY EXHAUSTED SO THEY LAY DOWN TO TAKE A SHORT REST
AND AGAIN GAVE IT THREE WOUNDS BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN JUST AS THE PRINCE BEGAN CHASING IT FOR THE FOURTH TIME THE BEAST FLED TO A GREAT WHITE STONE TILTED IT UP AND ESCAPED INTO THE OTHER WORLD CRYING OUT TO THE PRINCE
THEY WERE DRIVEN INTO CAMP EARLY BY HEAVY RAINS WHICH DRENCHED CLOTHING BLANKETS AND EVEN THE PROVISIONS CAREFULLY STORED UNDER THE SADDLES AND LEATHER SADDLE COVERS THIS CAUSED A DELAY OF THIRTY SIX HOURS
WHERE THEY JOINED MESSRS TUCKER JOHNSON RICHEY AND OTHERS WHO BEING ANXIOUS TO ASSIST IN THE GOOD WORK HAD KILLED AND WERE FIRE DRYING BEEF TO TAKE UP THE MOUNTAINS HERE TWO DAYS WERE SPENT MAKING PACK SADDLES DRIVING IN HORSES
INTO EACH OF THESE HE ENTERED TOOK THE MAIDENS ROBES WENT OUT AGAIN TURNED THE PALACES BACK INTO EGGS AND WENT HOME AND WHEN HE GOT THERE HE HUNG UP THE ROBES ON THE WALL AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP
AS SOON AS THEY REACHED THE COUNTRY AND WERE STILL ON DUTY IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE PROVINCE AND THE NON ENLISTED WERE DEEMED NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE COLONIES OF AMERICAN WOMEN AND CHILDREN ENCAMPED ON THE SOIL OF THE ENEMY MOREOVER
AND RENDER ALL POSSIBLE AID TOWARD THE IMMEDIATE RESCUE OF THE SNOW BOUND
STIR THEM WHILE BOILING TO KEEP THEM FROM SPOTTING THIS DYE WILL MAKE A SALMON OR ORANGE COLOR ACCORDING TO THE STRENGTH OF IT AND THE TIME THE GOODS REMAIN IN DRAIN THEM OUT OF THE DYE AND DRY THEM QUICK IN THE SHADE WHEN DRY WASH THEM IN SOFT SOAP SUDS
AND LET THEM REMAIN IN IT TILL OF A GOOD COLOR THE DYE STUFF SHOULD BE KEPT WARM
KNOWN TO HUMAN NATURE SOME OF THE LISTENERS HAD PARTED FROM MEMBERS OF THE DONNER PARTY AT THE LITTLE SANDY WHEN ITS PROSPECTS APPEARED SO BRIGHT AND THE MISFORTUNES WHICH HAD SINCE BEFALLEN THE PARTY SEEMED INCREDIBLE
AND LET IT DISSOLVE WHEN THE WATER BOILS STIR THE ALUM AND TARTAR UP IN IT PUT IN THE GOODS AND LET THEM BOIL A COUPLE OF HOURS THEN RINSE THEM IN FAIR WATER EMPTY THE KETTLE AND PUT IN THREE GALLONS OF WATER AND THE MADDER
DATING FROM THE TIME THE PARTY ENTERED THE SNOW THE REMAINING SEVEN PUSHED AHEAD AND ON THE EIGHTEENTH
DISSOLVE TWENTY WEIGHT OF WHITE POTASH IN THREE PAILSFUL OF WATER HEAT TWENTY POUNDS OF STRAINED GREASE THEN MIX IT WITH THE DISSOLVED POTASH AND BOIL THEM TOGETHER TILL THE WHOLE BECOMES A THICK JELLY WHICH IS ASCERTAINED
BECAUSE HE WAS SO STUPID FEELING SURE HE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT HE TOOK HIS ARMS AND WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE PARK AND SAT DOWN ON THE GRASS IN SUCH A POSITION THAT THE MOMENT HE WENT ASLEEP HIS WEAPONS WOULD PRICK HIM AND HE WOULD AWAKE
WHEN THE ROPE WAS MADE THE PRINCE CALLED FOR HIS BROTHERS AND HE AND THEY HAVING TAKEN SERVANTS WITH THEM AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS NEEDED FOR A WHOLE YEAR SET OUT FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE BEAST HAD DISAPPEARED UNDER THE STONE
BUT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT THE NEXT DAY THE SECOND SON WENT AND DID JUST THE SAME THEIR FATHER SCOLDED THEM BOTH SOUNDLY AND THERE WAS AN END OF IT WELL ON THE THIRD DAY THE YOUNGEST SON UNDERTOOK THE TASK THEY ALL LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN
IN ADDITION TO A GENEROUS SUBSCRIPTION OFFERED THEIR LAUNCH
FILL THE BARREL WITH WEAK LYE THIS METHOD OF MAKING SOAP IS MUCH EASIER THAN TO MAKE A LYE OF YOUR ASHES WHILE IT IS AS CHEAP IF YOU SELL YOUR ASHES TO THE SOAP BOILER
MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN CAN BE IMAGINED ANYWHERE BUT IN A FAIRY TALE WHO SAID THOU WHO ART IN MY HOUSE NAME THYSELF IF THOU ART AN OLD MAN THOU SHALT BE MY FATHER IF A MIDDLE AGED MAN MY BROTHER
THE TEN KEPT TOGETHER COURAGEOUSLY
NEITHER OF THEM OFFERED TO DO SO THEN HE LAUGHED AT THEM FOR BEING SUCH COWARDS AND SAID WELL BROTHERS FAREWELL LOWER ME INTO THE OTHER WORLD AND DON'T GO AWAY FROM HERE BUT AS SOON AS THE CORD IS JERKED PULL IT UP
WINDSOR AND CASTILE SOAP
BUT AS SOON AS HE TOUCHED IT AWAY IT FLEW TO A DISTANCE THOUGH IT WAS EVER SO BIG BIG AS A HILL AND WHEN HE HAD FLUNG THE STONE ASIDE HE SPOKE A SECOND TIME TO HIS BROTHERS SAYING WHO IS GOING INTO THE OTHER WORLD TO OVERCOME THE NORKA
AND SET OFF AGAIN IN PURSUIT CAUGHT UP THE BEAST AND AGAIN BEGAN FIGHTING WITH IT AGAIN THE PRINCE GAVE THE BEAST THREE WOUNDS AND THEN HE AND THE BEAST LAY DOWN AGAIN TO REST THEREUPON AWAY FLED THE BEAST AS BEFORE THE PRINCE CAUGHT IT UP
AND ADOLPH BRENHEIM GAVE UP AND TURNED BACK MISTER TUCKER FEARING THAT OTHERS MIGHT BECOME DISHEARTENED AND DO LIKEWISE GUARANTEED EACH MAN WHO WOULD PERSEVERE TO THE END FIVE DOLLARS PER DIEM
PUT THEM IN A BRASS KETTLE WITH SUFFICIENT FAIR WATER TO COVER YOUR GOODS SET IT WHERE IT WILL BOIL BRISKLY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES THEN PUT IN THE GOODS WHICH SHOULD BE WASHED CLEAN AND RINSED IN FAIR WATER WHEN THE GOODS HAVE BOILED HALF AN HOUR
I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR THEE THEN CARRY ME INTO THE OTHER WORLD HE REPLIED MAKE ME A LARGE VESSEL WITH A PARTITION IN THE MIDDLE SHE SAID CATCH ALL SORTS OF GAME
APPROPRIATED FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS ON GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT TOWARD OUTFITTING THIS RELIEF PARTY FURTHERMORE
AND SHE GAVE HIM A SWORD OF STEEL AND A DRAUGHT OF THE WATER OF STRENGTH AND SHE TOLD HIM TO CUT OFF HER BROTHER'S HEAD AT A SINGLE STROKE AND WHEN HE HAD HEARD THESE THINGS HE WENT HIS WAY AND WHEN THE PRINCE CAME TO THE BLUE SEA HE LOOKED
AND LET THE WATER BOIL FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES THEN PUT IN SUFFICIENT COLD WATER TO MAKE IT LUKEWARM PUT IN THE GOODS AND BOIL THEM AN HOUR AND A QUARTER TAKE THEM OUT WITHOUT WRINGING AND DRY THEM IN A SHADY PLACE THE BLOSSOMS OF THE BALM OF GILEAD
AFTER THEY SHOULD CEASE TO BE OF USE AT MULE SPRINGS THE PARTY BUILT A BRUSH STORE HOUSE FOR THE EXTRA SUPPLIES AND APPOINTED GEORGE TUCKER AND WILLIAM COON CAMP KEEPERS
FOR EVERYTHING HAD TO BE SUN OR FIRE DRIED BEFORE THE PARTY COULD RESUME TRAVEL UPON REACHING MULE SPRINGS THE PARTY FOUND THE SNOW FROM THREE TO FOUR FEET DEEP AND CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS SAW THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED FARTHER WITH THE HORSES
AND IT SAID TO HIM HAIL PRINCE IVAN LONG HAVE I AWAITED THEE HE MOUNTED THE HORSE AND RODE ON RODE AND RODE UNTIL HE SAW STANDING BEFORE HIM A PALACE MADE OF COPPER HE ENTERED THE COURTYARD TIED UP HIS HORSE
SO THAT YOU CAN SQUEEZE ENOUGH OF IT THROUGH THE BAG TO MAKE THE SUDS A DEEP YELLOW PUT IN THE ARTICLES WHICH SHOULD BE CLEAN AND FREE FROM COLOR
ALLOW A POUND OF LOGWOOD TO EACH POUND OF GOODS THAT ARE TO BE DYED SOAK IT OVER NIGHT IN SOFT WATER THEN BOIL IT AN HOUR AND STRAIN THE WATER IN WHICH IT IS BOILED
RELIEF MEASURES INAUGURATED IN CALIFORNIA DISTURBED CONDITIONS BECAUSE OF MEXICAN WAR GENEROUS SUBSCRIPTIONS THREE PARTIES ORGANIZE FIRST RELIEF UNDER RACINE TUCKER
WHEN THE PRINCESSES SAW THAT THE CLOTHES WERE THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN THEIRS IN THE OTHER WORLD THEY GUESSED THAT PRINCE IVAN WAS IN THIS WORLD SO THEY EXCHANGED GLANCES WITH EACH OTHER BUT THEY HELD THEIR PEACE AND THE MASTER
AFTER THEIR FRUITLESS ATTEMPT TO SCALE THE MOUNTAINS THE WAGON WAS FOUND UNDER SNOW TEN FEET IN DEPTH BUT ITS SUPPLIES HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY WILD BEASTS WARNED BY THIS CATASTROPHE
WHILE THE EARLY SUNLIGHT OF JANUARY NINETEENTH WAS FLOODING HIS ROOM WITH CHEER AND WARMTH HE DICTATED A LETTER TO MISTER JOHN SINCLAIR
INASMUCH AS THROUGH HIM THEY WERE ENRICHED BY THE KING BY THE TIME THE PRINCELY WORKMAN HAD GONE THE ROUND OF ALL THE ARTIFICERS THE PRINCESSES HAD RECEIVED WHAT THEY HAD ASKED FOR ALL THEIR CLOTHES WERE JUST LIKE WHAT THEY HAD BEEN IN THE OTHER WORLD

AND WENT INDOORS IN ONE OF THE ROOMS A DINNER WAS LAID OUT HE SAT DOWN AND DINED AND THEN WENT INTO A BEDROOM THERE HE FOUND A BED ON WHICH HE LAY DOWN TO REST PRESENTLY THERE CAME IN A LADY
HAVING HANDED OVER THE CLOTHES WENT HOME BUT HE NO LONGER FOUND HIS DEAR JOURNEYMAN THERE FOR THE PRINCE HAD GONE TO A SHOEMAKER'S AND HIM TOO HE SENT TO WORK FOR THE KING AND IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT THE ROUND OF ALL THE ARTIFICERS
AND HIS BROTHERS BEGAN TO HAUL IT UP AND WHEN THEY HAD HAULED IT UP AND HAD SET EYES ON THE WONDROUS MAIDENS THEY WENT ASIDE AND SAID LET'S LOWER THE ROPE PULL OUR BROTHER PART OF THE WAY UP AND THEN CUT THE ROPE
AND THEN GAVE IT A PULL HIS BROTHERS HOISTED THE STONE TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND THEN CUT THE ROPE DOWN FELL THE STONE AND BROKE IN PIECES

WHO HAD ALREADY TWICE SENT SUPPLIES FIRST BY STANTON AND AGAIN BY MC CUTCHEN AND REED IN THEIR UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE MOUNTAINS
AND THEN THE PRINCE TOOK LEAVE OF HER AND WENT ON TO THE SECOND SISTER THE ONE WHO LIVED IN THE SILVER PALACE AND WITH HER ALSO HE STAYED AWHILE SHE TOLD HIM THAT HER BROTHER NORKA WAS THEN AT HER YOUNGEST SISTER'S
LIVING NEAR SUTTER'S FORT IN WHICH HE STATED AS BRIEFLY AS POSSIBLE THE CONDITIONS AND PERILS SURROUNDING THE SNOW BOUND TRAVELLERS AND BEGGED HIM TO USE EVERY MEANS IN HIS POWER TOWARD THEIR IMMEDIATE RESCUE BEAR RIVER WAS RUNNING HIGH
HER HUSBAND DESPATCHED AN OPEN LETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF SAN FRANCISCO DESCRIBING THE ARRIVAL
AND THEY HANDED OVER THE EGGS TO HIM AND THEN THEY ALL WENT TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH THEY HAD TO BE HOISTED INTO THE UPPER WORLD AND WHEN THEY CAME TO WHERE THE ROPE WAS THE PRINCE TOOK HOLD OF IT AND MADE THE MAIDENS FAST TO IT
SEPARATE IT FROM THE LYE AND HEAT IT OVER A SLOW FIRE LET IT BOIL A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THEN TAKE IT FROM THE FIRE IF YOU WISH TO HAVE IT A YELLOW COLOR PUT IN A LITTLE PALM OIL AND TURN IT OUT INTO WOODEN VESSELS WHEN COLD
WOMEN LEFT THE ROOM SOBBING AND MEN CALLED THOSE PASSING IN FROM THE STREET TO JOIN THE KNOTS OF EARNEST TALKERS ALL WERE READY AND WILLING TO DO BUT ALAS THE OBSTACLES WHICH HAD PREVENTED MISTER REED GETTING MEN FOR THE MOUNTAIN WORK
BEGGED HER TO BE COMFORTED ASSURING HER THAT THE CAUSE OF HER DISTRESS SHOULD BE SPEEDILY REMOVED WHEN UPON THE OCCASION OF THE PUBLIC ADOPTION OF HIS SON XUTHUS GAVE A GRAND BANQUET
THEN SHE RAN THROUGH THE GARDENS CALLING HIS NAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT STILL THERE WAS SILENCE OH WHAT SHALL I DO IF I CANNOT FIND HIM SHE SAID I SHALL NEVER BE HAPPY AGAIN
AND IN PLACE OF THE BEAST STOOD A HANDSOME PRINCE DRESSED IN A DOUBLET OF WHITE AND SILVER LIKE ONE MADE READY FOR A WEDDING HE KNELT AT BEAUTY'S FEET AND CLASPED HER HANDS DEAR BEAUTY HE SAID NOTHING BUT YOUR LOVE COULD HAVE DISENCHANTED ME
POURED UPON THE GROUND A PORTION OF THE WINE BEFORE PUTTING IT TO HIS LIPS WHEN SUDDENLY AS IF BY A MIRACLE A DOVE FLEW INTO THE BANQUET HALL AND SIPPED OF THE WINE OF THE LIBATION WHEREUPON THE POOR LITTLE CREATURE BEGAN TO QUIVER IN EVERY LIMB
BUT THEY SAID THAT EVERYTHING SHE DID WAS DONE WRONG BUT BEAUTY BORE ALL THEIR UNKINDNESS PATIENTLY FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE IN THIS WAY A WHOLE YEAR WENT BY AND THEN ONE DAY A LETTER CAME FOR THE MERCHANT
IS IT A QUESTION OF COUNTRY HE ENLISTS IS IT A QUESTION OF LIBERTY HE TEARS UP THE PAVEMENTS BEWARE HIS HAIR FILLED WITH WRATH IS EPIC HIS BLOUSE DRAPES ITSELF LIKE THE FOLDS OF A CHLAMYS
WE SHALL NOT BE SO RICH AS BEFORE BUT WE SHALL HAVE ENOUGH TO KEEP US IN COMFORT GET ME MY TRAVELING CLOAK BEAUTY I WILL SET OUT AT ONCE TO CLAIM MY SHIP AND NOW TELL ME GIRLS WHAT SHALL I BRING YOU WHEN I COME BACK A HUNDRED POUNDS SAID MARIGOLD WITHOUT HESITATING AN INSTANT
MOTHER AND SON NOW BECAME RECONCILED TO EACH OTHER AND CREUSA REVEALED TO ION THE SECRET OF HIS DIVINE ORIGIN
I WANT A NEW SILK DRESS SAID DRESSALINDA AN APPLE GREEN ONE SEWN WITH SEED PEARLS AND GREEN SHOES WITH RED HEELS AND A NECKLACE OF EMERALDS AND A BOX OF GLOVES AND WHAT SHALL I BRING FOR YOU MY BEAUTY ASKED THE FATHER AS HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER HELPED HIM TO PUT ON HIS TRAVELING CLOAK
A WICKED FAIRY TURNED ME INTO A BEAST AND CONDEMNED ME TO REMAIN ONE UNTIL SOME FAIR AND GOOD MAIDEN SHOULD LOVE ME WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY ME IN SPITE OF MY UGLINESS AND STUPIDITY NOW DEAR ONE THE ENCHANTMENT IS BROKEN LET US GO BACK TO MY PALACE
HOW SHALL I REACH HOME SAID BEAUTY I DO NOT KNOW THE WAY THEN THE BEAST GAVE HER A RING AND TOLD HER TO PUT IT ON HER FINGER WHEN SHE WENT TO BED TURN THE RUBY TOWARDS THE PALM OF HER HAND AND THEN SHE WOULD WAKE UP IN HER FATHER'S COTTAGE
THE RESPONSE WAS THAT XUTHUS SHOULD REGARD THE FIRST PERSON WHO MET HIM ON LEAVING THE SANCTUARY AS HIS SON NOW IT HAPPENED THAT ION THE YOUNG GUARDIAN OF THE TEMPLE WAS THE FIRST TO GREET HIS VIEW
TAKE CARE HE WILL MAKE OF THE FIRST RUE GRENETAT WHICH COMES TO HAND CAUDINE FORKS
ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT A WEEK AND TWO DAYS HAD GONE BY SINCE SHE LEFT THE BEAST YET AFTER THAT DREAM SHE AT ONCE TURNED THE RUBY TOWARDS HER PALM
AND AS THIS WAS A SOURCE OF GREAT GRIEF TO BOTH OF THEM
AND IN A FEW MOMENTS EXPIRED ION'S SUSPICIONS AT ONCE FELL UPON THE OBSEQUIOUS SERVANT OF CREUSA WHO WITH SUCH OFFICIOUS ATTENTION HAD FILLED HIS CUP HE VIOLENTLY SEIZED THE OLD MAN AND ACCUSED HIM OF HIS MURDEROUS INTENTIONS
BEAUTY SCREAMED AND CLUNG TO HER FATHER DON'T BE FRIGHTENED SAID THE BEAST GENTLY BUT TELL ME DO YOU COME HERE OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL YES SAID BEAUTY TREMBLING YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL SAID THE BEAST AND THEN TURNING TO THE OLD MAN
BUT YOUR FOOLISHNESS HAS COST HIM HIS LIFE NO SAID BEAUTY IT IS MY LIFE THAT SHALL BE SACRIFICED FOR WHEN THE THREE MONTHS ARE OVER I SHALL GO TO THE BEAST AND HE MAY KILL ME IF HE WILL BUT HE SHALL NEVER HURT MY DEAR FATHER THE FATHER TRIED HARD TO PERSUADE HER NOT TO GO
HE EXPECTED TO FIND A WOODCUTTER'S COTTAGE
I DID NOT THINK AFTER ALL YOU HAVE GIVEN ME THAT YOU WOULD GRUDGE ME A FLOWER TELL ME ABOUT THIS DAUGHTER OF YOURS SAID THE BEAST SUDDENLY IS SHE A GOOD GIRL THE BEST AND DEAREST IN THE WORLD SAID THE OLD MERCHANT AND THEN HE BEGAN TO WEEP
OH DEAR BEAST SHE CRIED AND ARE YOU REALLY DEAD ALAS ALAS THEN I TOO WILL DIE FOR I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT YOU IMMEDIATELY THE BEAST OPENED HIS EYES SIGHED AND SAID
THE YOUNG CHILD WAS CAREFULLY TENDED AND REARED BY HIS KIND FOSTER MOTHER AND WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE SERVICE OF THE TEMPLE WHERE HE WAS INTRUSTED WITH SOME OF THE MINOR DUTIES OF THE HOLY EDIFICE AND NOW TO RETURN TO CREUSA
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE HIS ROOMS IN THE PALACE WERE BUT SHE FELT SHE COULD NOT WAIT TILL SUPPER TIME BEFORE SEEING HIM SO SHE RAN HITHER AND THITHER CALLING HIS NAME
THIS IS SOME FAIRIES WORK I HAD BETTER NOT LOOK ANY FARTHER FOR THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE AND WITH THAT HE TUMBLED INTO BED AND BEING VERY TIRED HE WENT TO SLEEP AT ONCE AND SLEPT LIKE A TOP TILL IT WAS TIME TO GET UP IN THE MORNING
PREFECTS OF THE POLICE DO NOT DEEM IT POSSIBLE THAT A CAT CAN TRANSFORM ITSELF INTO A LION THAT DOES HAPPEN HOWEVER AND IN THAT LIES THE MIRACLE WROUGHT BY THE POPULACE OF PARIS
IN THE MEANTIME THE MERCHANT WENT HIS WAY TO THE CITY FULL OF HOPE AND GREAT PLANS AS TO WHAT HE WOULD DO WITH HIS MONEY BUT WHEN HE GOT THERE HE FOUND THAT SOME ONE HAD PLAYED A TRICK ON HIM AND NO SHIP OF HIS HAD COME INTO HARBOR SO HE WAS JUST AS BADLY OFF AS BEFORE
FOR WHOM HE CONSTRUCTED SEVERAL IMPORTANT PUBLIC WORKS BUT NO SOONER DID MINOS RECEIVE THE INTELLIGENCE THAT HIS GREAT ARCHITECT HAD FOUND AN ASYLUM WITH COCALUS THAN HE SAILED OVER TO SICILY WITH A LARGE ARMY AND SENT MESSENGERS TO THE SICILIAN KING DEMANDING THE SURRENDER OF HIS GUEST
SO THE MERCHANT SAT DOWN AS BOLD AS YOU PLEASE AND MADE A VERY HEARTY SUPPER AFTER WHICH HE AGAIN THOUGHT HE WOULD LOOK FOR THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HE STARTED OFF AND OPENED ANOTHER DOOR BUT THERE HE SAW A BED MERELY TO LOOK AT WHICH MADE YOU SLEEPY
AND WHEN XUTHUS BEHELD THE BEAUTIFUL YOUTH HE GLADLY WELCOMED HIM AS HIS SON DECLARING THAT THE GODS HAD SENT HIM TO BE A BLESSING AND COMFORT TO HIS OLD AGE CREUSA HOWEVER WHO CONCLUDED THAT THE YOUTH WAS THE OFFSPRING OF A SECRET MARRIAGE ON THE PART OF HER HUSBAND
NO SAID THE BEAST YOU MUST DIE THE POOR MERCHANT FELL UPON HIS KNEES AND TRIED TO THINK OF SOMETHING TO SAY TO SOFTEN THE HEART OF THE CRUEL BEAST AND AT LAST HE SAID SIR I ONLY STOLE THIS ROSE BECAUSE MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER ASKED ME TO BRING HER ONE
SO THE BEAST SAT DOWN TO SUPPER WITH HER AND WHEN IT WAS FINISHED HE SAID I AM VERY UGLY BEAUTY AND I AM VERY STUPID BUT I LOVE YOU WILL YOU MARRY ME NO BEAST SAID BEAUTY GENTLY THE POOR BEAST SIGHED AND WENT AWAY
GLASSES AND BOTTLES JUGS OF BEER MINGLED WITH FLASKS OF WINE VERY LITTLE ORDER ON THE TABLE SOME DISORDER BENEATH IT THEY MADE BENEATH THE TABLE A NOISE A CLATTER OF THE FEET THAT WAS ABOMINABLE SAYS MOLIERE
WHEN HE GOT OUT OF BED HE FOUND HE HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO BE GRATEFUL FOR FOR ON THE CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE LAY A FINE SUIT OF NEW CLOTHES MARKED WITH HIS NAME AND WITH TEN GOLD PIECES IN EVERY POCKET
BUT BEAUTY AT ANY RATE CAN HAVE WHAT SHE WANTED SO HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND PLUCKED THE BIGGEST RED ROSE WITHIN HIS REACH AS THE STALK SNAPPED IN HIS FINGERS HE STARTED BACK IN TERROR FOR HE HEARD AN ANGRY ROAR
HOWEVER IF ONE OF YOUR DAUGHTERS LOVES YOU WELL ENOUGH TO SUFFER INSTEAD OF YOU SHE MAY GO BACK AND TELL THEM WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU BUT YOU MUST GIVE ME YOUR PROMISE THAT EITHER YOU OR ONE OF YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL BE AT MY PALACE DOOR IN THREE MONTHS TIME FROM TO DAY THE WRETCHED MAN PROMISED
A SQUADRON OF MAGNIFICENT BODY GUARDS WITH THEIR CLARIONS AT THEIR HEAD WERE DESCENDING THE AVENUE DE NEUILLY THE WHITE FLAG SHOWING FAINTLY ROSY IN THE SETTING SUN
IF WE COULD ONLY MAKE HER FORGET THE DAY THE BEAST MIGHT BE ANGRY AND KILL HER AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A CHANCE FOR US SO ON THE DAY BEFORE SHE OUGHT TO HAVE GONE BACK THEY PUT SOME POPPY JUICE IN A CUP OF WINE WHICH THEY GAVE HER
HAVING THE LIMBS ALTOGETHER UNDEFINED BUT GREAT AS WAS HIS GENIUS STILL GREATER WAS HIS VANITY AND HE COULD BROOK NO RIVAL NOW HIS NEPHEW AND PUPIL TALUS EXHIBITED GREAT TALENT
WHICH WAS AN IMMENSE BUILDING FULL OF INTRICATE PASSAGES INTERSECTING EACH OTHER IN SUCH A MANNER THAT EVEN DAEDALUS HIMSELF IS SAID UPON ONE OCCASION TO HAVE NEARLY LOST HIS WAY IN IT AND IT WAS IN THIS BUILDING THE KING PLACED THE MINOTAUR
THIS WAS THE STATE WHICH THE SHEPHERD IDYL BEGUN AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING HAD REACHED AT HALF PAST FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON THE SUN WAS SETTING THEIR APPETITES WERE SATISFIED
FILL THIS WITH ANY TREASURES THAT TAKE YOUR FANCY SAID THE BEAST AND THE MERCHANT FILLED IT UP WITH PRECIOUS THINGS FROM THE BEAST'S TREASURE HOUSE I WILL SEND IT HOME FOR YOU SAID THE BEAST SHUTTING DOWN THE LID AND SO WITH A HEAVY HEART THE MERCHANT WENT AWAY
JUST RIDING UP TO THE DOOR OF HIS COTTAGE THAT NIGHT WHEN BEAUTY SAT DOWN TO SUPPER THE BEAST CAME IN MAY I HAVE SUPPER WITH YOU SAID HE THAT MUST BE AS YOU PLEASE SAID BEAUTY
WILL NOW BECOME VISIBLE SO THEY RETURNED TO THE PALACE WHICH BY THIS TIME WAS CROWDED WITH COURTIERS EAGER TO KISS THE HANDS OF THE PRINCE AND HIS BRIDE AND THE PRINCE WHISPERED TO ONE OF HIS ATTENDANTS WHO WENT OUT
WHEN SHE WANTED TO COME BACK SHE WAS TO DO THE SAME THING SO IN THE MORNING WHEN SHE AWOKE SHE FOUND HERSELF AT HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND THE OLD MAN WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY TO SEE HER SAFE AND SOUND BUT HER SISTERS DID NOT WELCOME HER VERY KINDLY
IT IS NOT IN PARIS THESE ARE VERY PRETTY MEN SIRE IT WOULD TAKE ALL OF TWO OF THEM TO MAKE ONE OF YOUR GRENADIERS THERE IS NOTHING TO BE FEARED ON THE PART OF THE POPULACE OF PARIS THE CAPITAL
NO ONE SLEEPS MORE SOUNDLY THAN HE NO ONE IS MORE FRANKLY FRIVOLOUS AND LAZY THAN HE NO ONE CAN BETTER ASSUME THE AIR OF FORGETFULNESS LET HIM NOT BE TRUSTED NEVERTHELESS HE IS READY FOR ANY SORT OF COOL DEED
THE BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE ICARUS WAS WASHED UP BY THE TIDE AND WAS BURIED BY THE BEREAVED FATHER ON AN ISLAND WHICH HE CALLED AFTER HIS SON
POSSESSED THE ESTEEM OF THE REPUBLICS OF OLD IN THEIR EYES IT WAS LIBERTY INCARNATE
HE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE AND FOR THIS PURPOSE INGENIOUSLY CONTRIVED WINGS FOR HIMSELF AND HIS YOUNG SON ICARUS WHOM HE DILIGENTLY TRAINED HOW TO USE THEM HAVING AWAITED A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY FATHER AND SON COMMENCED THEIR FLIGHT
BUT BEAUTY HAPPILY MARRIED TO HER PRINCE WENT SECRETLY TO THE STATUES EVERY DAY AND WEPT OVER THEM AND BY HER TEARS THEIR STONY HEARTS WERE SOFTENED AND THEY WERE CHANGED INTO FLESH AND BLOOD AGAIN AND WERE GOOD AND KIND FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
HAVING INVENTED BOTH THE SAW AND THE COMPASS AND DAEDALUS FEARING LEST HE MIGHT OVERSHADOW HIS OWN FAME SECRETLY KILLED HIM BY THROWING HIM DOWN FROM THE CITADEL OF PALLAS ATHENE THE MURDER BEING DISCOVERED
HE TOLD HIM THAT HE MIGHT SLEEP THERE FOR THAT NIGHT BUT IN THE MORNING HE MUST GO AND LEAVE HIS DAUGHTER BEHIND HIM THEY WENT TO BED AND SLEPT SOUNDLY AND THE NEXT MORNING THE FATHER DEPARTED WEEPING BITTERLY BEAUTY LEFT ALONE TRIED NOT TO FEEL FRIGHTENED
HE IS ILL AND HE THINKS THAT I AM DEAD DO LET ME GO AND CHEER HIM UP AND I WILL PROMISE FAITHFULLY TO RETURN TO YOU VERY WELL SAID THE BEAST KINDLY BUT DON'T STAY AWAY MORE THAN A WEEK FOR IF YOU DO I SHALL DIE OF GRIEF BECAUSE I LOVE YOU SO DEARLY
THERE WAS STILL LEFT TO HIM A LITTLE HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY AND TO THIS WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE HAD BEEN SOLD HE RETIRED HIS THREE DAUGHTERS OF COURSE WENT WITH HIM MARIGOLD AND DRESSALINDA WERE VERY CROSS TO THINK THAT THEY HAD LOST ALL THEIR MONEY
AND HE WILL FREE THE WORLD
AND BEAUTY AND THE BEAST WHO WAS A BEAST NO MORE BUT A HANDSOME PRINCE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER AND INDEED I BELIEVE THEY ARE LIVING HAPPILY STILL
BUT WHEN THERE IS GLORY AT THE END OF IT HE IS WORTHY OF ADMIRATION IN EVERY SORT OF FURY GIVE HIM A PIKE HE WILL PRODUCE THE TENTH OF AUGUST GIVE HIM A GUN YOU WILL HAVE AUSTERLITZ HE IS NAPOLEON'S STAY AND DANTON'S RESOURCE
THIS LITTLE MAN WILL ARISE AND HIS GAZE WILL BE TERRIBLE AND HIS BREATH WILL BECOME A TEMPEST AND THERE WILL ISSUE FORTH FROM THAT SLENDER CHEST ENOUGH WIND TO DISARRANGE THE FOLDS OF THE ALPS
AND THIS MADE HER SO SLEEPY THAT SHE SLEPT FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS AND NIGHTS AT THE END OF THAT TIME HER SLEEP GREW TROUBLED AND SHE DREAMED THAT SHE SAW THE BEAST LYING DEAD AMONG THE ROSES IN THE BEAUTIFUL GARDENS OF HIS PALACE AND FROM THIS DREAM SHE AWOKE CRYING BITTERLY
THEN SHE REMEMBERED HER DREAM AND RAN TO THE ROSE GARDEN AND THERE SURE ENOUGH BESIDE THE BASIN OF THE BIG FOUNTAIN LAY THE POOR BEAST WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF LIFE IN HIM BEAUTY FLUNG HERSELF ON HER KNEES BESIDE HIM
XUTHUS SON OF A EOLUS GREATLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF ON THE SIDE OF THE ATHENIANS AND AS A REWARD FOR HIS VALUABLE SERVICES THE HAND OF CREUSA THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS BESTOWED UPON HIM IN MARRIAGE THEIR UNION HOWEVER WAS NOT BLEST WITH CHILDREN
HE FELT QUITE A DIFFERENT MAN WHEN HE HAD PUT ON THE SUIT OF BLUE AND SILVER AND JINGLED THE GOLD PIECES OF MONEY IN HIS POCKETS
A MONSTER WITH THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS OF A BULL AND THE BODY OF A MAN IN THE COURSE OF TIME THE GREAT ARTIST BECAME WEARY OF HIS LONG EXILE MORE ESPECIALLY AS THE KING UNDER THE GUISE OF FRIENDSHIP KEPT HIM ALMOST A PRISONER
AND EVERY NIGHT THE SAME THING HAPPENED HE ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HER AND THEN ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD MARRY HIM AND SHE ALWAYS SAID NO BEAST ALL THIS TIME SHE WAS WAITED ON BY INVISIBLE HANDS AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A QUEEN
AND THE NEXT MINUTE A DREADFUL BEAST SPRANG UPON HIM IT WAS TALLER THAN ANY MAN AND UGLIER THAN ANY ANIMAL BUT WHAT SEEMED MOST DREADFUL OF ALL TO THE MERCHANT IT SPOKE TO HIM WITH A MAN'S VOICE AFTER IT HAD ROARED AT HIM WITH THE BEAST'S
THE DELPHIC PRIESTESS APPEARED ON THE SCENE AND EXPLAINED THE TRUE RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTED BETWEEN CREUSA AND ION IN ORDER TO SET ALL DOUBTS AT REST SHE PRODUCED THE CHARMS WHICH SHE HAD FOUND ROUND THE NECK OF THE INFANT
AT ANY RATE HE THOUGHT I SHALL HAVE THREE MONTHS MORE OF LIFE THEN THE BEAST SAID I WILL NOT LET YOU GO EMPTY HANDED SO THE MERCHANT FOLLOWED HIM BACK INTO THE PALACE THERE ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL LAY A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL CHEST OF WROUGHT SILVER
AND AFTER BEING SO RICH AND SOUGHT AFTER THEY MUST NOW LIVE IN A MISERABLE COTTAGE BUT BEAUTY'S ONLY THOUGHT WAS TO CHEER HER OLD FATHER AND WHILE HER TWO SISTERS SAT ON WOODEN CHAIRS AND CRIED AND BEWAILED THEMSELVES
WHOSE SIGN COULD THEN BE SEEN IN THE RUE DE RIVOLI NEAR DELORME ALLEY A LARGE BUT UGLY ROOM WITH AN ALCOVE AND A BED AT THE END
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE STATURE OF THIS POPULATION SHOULD HAVE DIMINISHED IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS AND THE POPULACE OF THE SUBURBS IS STILL MORE PUNY THAN AT THE TIME OF THE REVOLUTION IT IS NOT DANGEROUS IN SHORT IT IS AN AMIABLE RABBLE
FORGOT ALTOGETHER HIS FATHER'S OFT REPEATED INJUNCTION NOT TO APPROACH TOO NEAR THE SUN THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE WAX BY MEANS OF WHICH HIS WINGS WERE ATTACHED MELTED AND HE FELL INTO THE SEA AND WAS DROWNED
BUT THE MAGIC LOOKING GLASS WAS BEST OF ALL FOR IN IT SHE COULD SEE WHATEVER SHE WISHED AS THE DAYS WENT BY AND HER SLIGHTEST WISH WAS GRANTED ALMOST BEFORE SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WANTED SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE BEAST MUST LOVE HER VERY DEARLY
TAKE THEM MY CHILD HE SAID AND CHERISH THEM FOR THEY HAVE COST YOUR POOR FATHER HIS LIFE AND WITH THAT HE SAT DOWN AND TOLD THEM THE WHOLE STORY THE TWO ELDER SISTERS WEPT AND WAILED AND OF COURSE BLAMED BEAUTY FOR ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED
BEAUTY WILL YOU MARRY ME AND BEAUTY BESIDE HERSELF WITH JOY WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HE WAS STILL ALIVE ANSWERED YES YES DEAR BEAST FOR I LOVE YOU DEARLY
AND SHE WAS VERY SORRY TO SEE HOW SAD HE LOOKED EVERY NIGHT WHEN SHE SAID NO TO HIS OFFER OF MARRIAGE ONE DAY SHE SAW IN HER MIRROR THAT HER FATHER WAS ILL SO THAT NIGHT SHE SAID TO THE BEAST
THE OLD SERVANT OF CREUSA CONTRIVED TO MIX A STRONG POISON IN THE WINE OF THE UNSUSPECTING ION BUT THE YOUTH ACCORDING TO THE PIOUS CUSTOM OF THE ANCIENTS OF OFFERING A LIBATION TO THE GODS BEFORE PARTAKING OF ANY REPAST
I WISH WE HAD GONE SAID MARIGOLD BEAUTY ALWAYS GETS THE BEST OF EVERYTHING TELL US ALL ABOUT YOUR GRAND PALACE SAID DRESSALINDA AND WHAT YOU DO AND HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME SO BEAUTY THINKING IT WOULD AMUSE THEM TO HEAR
ON THE SUBJECT OF THE SUBURBS OF PARIS TERMINATED WITH THESE LINES TAKING ALL THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION SIRE THERE IS NOTHING TO BE FEARED FROM THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE AS HEEDLESS AND AS INDOLENT AS CATS THE POPULACE IS RESTLESS IN THE PROVINCES
AFTER THIS SAD EVENT DAEDALUS WINGED HIS FLIGHT TO THE ISLAND OF SICILY
UNGRATEFUL WRETCH SAID THE BEAST HAVE I NOT FED YOU LODGED YOU AND CLOTHED YOU AND NOW YOU MUST REPAY MY HOSPITALITY BY STEALING THE ONLY THING I CARE FOR MY ROSES MERCY MERCY CRIED THE MERCHANT
IT IS THANKS TO THE SUBURBAN MAN OF PARIS THAT THE REVOLUTION MIXED WITH ARMS CONQUERS EUROPE HE SINGS IT IS HIS DELIGHT PROPORTION HIS SONG TO HIS NATURE AND YOU WILL SEE
AND WERE WELL ON THEIR WAY WHEN ICARUS
AND THE RADIANT PARTY OF EIGHT SOMEWHAT WEARY AT LAST BECAME STRANDED IN BOMBARDA'S PUBLIC HOUSE
IT WAS QUITE DARK BY THE TIME HE CAME TO THE GREAT WOOD THROUGH WHICH HE HAD TO PASS TO GET TO HIS COTTAGE AND WHEN HE SAW A LIGHT SHINING THROUGH THE TREES HE DECIDED NOT TO GO TO HIS HOME THAT NIGHT
WERE NOTHING BUT LIGHT AND DUST THE TWO THINGS OF WHICH GLORY IS COMPOSED THE HORSES OF MARLY THOSE NEIGHING MARBLES WERE PRANCING IN A CLOUD OF GOLD CARRIAGES WERE GOING AND COMING
WHERE HE DEPOSITED HIS CHARGE ON THE STEPS OF THE TEMPLE NEXT MORNING THE DELPHIC PRIESTESS DISCOVERED THE INFANT AND WAS SO CHARMED BY HIS ENGAGING APPEARANCE THAT SHE ADOPTED HIM AS HER OWN SON
ONLY THIS TIME THE TABLE WAS LAID FOR TWO COME FATHER DEAR SAID BEAUTY TAKE COMFORT I DO NOT THINK THE BEAST MEANS TO KILL ME OR SURELY HE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH A GOOD SUPPER BUT THE NEXT MOMENT THE BEAST CAME INTO THE ROOM
WERE PLAYING AT RINGS AND REVOLVING ON THE WOODEN HORSES OTHERS WERE ENGAGED IN DRINKING SOME JOURNEYMAN PRINTERS HAD ON PAPER CAPS THEIR LAUGHTER WAS AUDIBLE EVERY THING WAS RADIANT IT WAS A TIME OF UNDISPUTED PEACE AND PROFOUND ROYALIST SECURITY
THE TWO ELDEST SISTERS WOULD DO NOTHING BUT SULK IN CORNERS WHILE BEAUTY SWEPT THE FLOORS AND WASHED THE DISHES AND DID HER BEST TO MAKE THE POOR COTTAGE PLEASANT THEY LED THEIR SISTER A DREADFUL LIFE TOO WITH THEIR COMPLAINTS FOR NOT ONLY DID THEY REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING THEMSELVES
TO THINK THAT HE MUST DIE AND LEAVE HIS BEAUTY ALONE IN THE WORLD WITH NO ONE TO BE KIND TO HER OH HE CRIED WHAT WILL MY POOR CHILDREN DO WITHOUT ME YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU STOLE THE ROSE SAID THE BEAST
WHEN HE AWOKE HE WAS QUITE SURPRISED TO FIND HIMSELF IN SUCH A SOFT AND COMFORTABLE BED BUT PRESENTLY HE REMEMBERED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM I MUST BE GOING HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT I WISH I COULD THANK MY HOST FOR MY GOOD REST AND MY GOOD SUPPER
HE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY LOOKING ABOUT TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NO TRUTH IN THE LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED AND IT WAS BEGINNING TO GET DUSK WHEN HE STARTED OUT WITH A SAD HEART TO MAKE THE JOURNEY HOME AGAIN HE WAS TIRED AND MISERABLE AND HE HAD TASTED NO FOOD SINCE HE LEFT HOME IN THE MORNING
THE TWO ELDEST WERE CALLED MARIGOLD AND DRESSALINDA NEVER A DAY PASSED BUT THESE TWO WENT OUT TO SOME FEAST OR JUNKETING BUT BEAUTY THE YOUNGEST LOVED TO STAY AT HOME AND KEEP HER OLD FATHER COMPANY NOW
ONCE UPON A TIME
AND EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE THOUGHT OF TO MAKE THE TIME PASS PLEASANTLY OH DEAR SHE SAID IF ONLY I COULD SEE MY POOR FATHER I SHOULD BE ALMOST HAPPY AS SHE SPOKE SHE HAPPENED TO LOOK AT A BIG MIRROR AND IN IT SHE SAW THE FORM OF HER FATHER REFLECTED
KNOCKED AND RANG IN VAIN AT THE GREAT GATE WARMED HIMSELF AT THE FIRE IN THE BIG HALL
AND WHEN HE HAD WARMED HIMSELF HE SET OUT TO LOOK FOR THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE BUT HE DID NOT LOOK FAR FOR BEHIND THE FIRST DOOR HE OPENED WAS A COSY LITTLE ROOM WITH SUPPER SET FOR ONE A SUPPER THE MERE LOOK OF WHICH MADE YOU HUNGRY
DAEDALUS WAS SUMMONED BEFORE THE COURT OF THE AREOPAGUS AND CONDEMNED TO DEATH BUT HE MADE HIS ESCAPE TO THE ISLAND OF CRETE WHERE HE WAS RECEIVED BY KING MINOS IN A MANNER WORTHY OF HIS GREAT REPUTATION DAEDALUS CONSTRUCTED FOR THE KING THE WORLD RENOWNED LABYRINTH
TOLD THEM AND THEIR ENVY INCREASED DAY BY DAY AT LAST DRESSALINDA SAID TO MARIGOLD
DOWN THE MARBLE STEPS HE WENT AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE GARDEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS FULL OF ROSES RED AND WHITE AND PINK AND YELLOW AND THE MERCHANT LOOKED AT THEM AND REMEMBERED BEAUTY'S WISH OH MY POOR DAUGHTERS HE SAID
AND HANGING SOME GOLDEN CHARMS ROUND HIS NECK INVOKED FOR HIM THE PROTECTION OF THE GODS AND CONCEALED HIM IN A LONELY CAVE APOLLO PITYING HIS DESERTED CHILD
WAS CHOKED WITH HAPPY PROMENADERS
A MAGNIFICENT AUGUST SUNLIGHT LIGHTLY TOUCHING THE PANES TWO TABLES UPON ONE OF THEM A TRIUMPHANT MOUNTAIN OF BOUQUETS MINGLED WITH THE HATS OF MEN AND WOMEN
WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS THEY LIVED IN A VERY FINE HOUSE IN A BEAUTIFUL CITY AND HAD MANY SERVANTS IN GRAND LIVERIES TO WAIT UPON THEM ALL THEIR FOOD WAS SERVED ON GOLD AND SILVER DISHES
THE INGENUOUS POLICE OF THE RESTORATION BEHELD THE POPULACE OF PARIS IN TOO ROSE COLORED A LIGHT IT IS NOT SO MUCH OF AN AMIABLE RABBLE AS IT IS THOUGHT THE PARISIAN IS TO THE FRENCHMAN WHAT THE ATHENIAN WAS TO THE GREEK
UNPREPARED FOR THIS SUDDEN ATTACK HE ADMITTED HIS GUILT BUT POINTED TO THE WIFE OF XUTHUS AS THE INSTIGATOR OF THE CRIME ION WAS ABOUT TO AVENGE HIMSELF UPON CREUSA WHEN BY MEANS OF THE DIVINE INTERVENTION OF APOLLO HIS FOSTER MOTHER
SHE RAN HERE AND THERE THROUGH THE PALACE AND FOUND IT MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANYTHING SHE HAD EVER IMAGINED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SET OF ROOMS IN THE PALACE HAD WRITTEN OVER THE DOORS BEAUTY'S ROOMS AND IN THEM SHE FOUND BOOKS AND MUSIC CANARY BIRDS AND PERSIAN CATS
ION WAS THE SON OF CREUSA THE BEAUTEOUS DAUGHTER OF ERECHTHEUS KING OF ATHENS AND THE SUN GOD PHOEBUS APOLLO TO WHOM SHE WAS UNITED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER FATHER
CALLED AFTER HIM THE IONIANS AND ALSO THAT XUTHUS AND CREUSA WOULD HAVE A SON CALLED DORUS WHO WOULD BE THE PROGENITOR OF THE DORIAN PEOPLE BOTH OF WHICH PREDICTIONS WERE IN DUE TIME VERIFIED DAEDALUS AND ICARUS
INDEED SISTER SAID BEAUTY THAT WAS NOT THE REASON I THOUGHT OUR FATHER WOULD HAVE ENOUGH TO DO IN SEEING TO THE SAFETY OF HIS SHIP WITHOUT BEING TROUBLED TO DO SHOPPING FOR ME BUT THE SISTERS WERE VERY MUCH OFFENDED
BEAUTY LIGHTED THE FIRE AND GOT THE SUPPER READY FOR THE MERCHANT WAS NOW SO POOR THAT HE COULD NOT EVEN KEEP A SERVANT
OH BRING ME A ROSE SAID BEAUTY HASTILY HER FATHER KISSED HER FONDLY AND SET OUT YOU SILLY GIRL SAID MARIGOLD YOU JUST WANT OUR FATHER TO THINK YOU ARE MORE UNSELFISH THAN WE ARE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT A ROSE INDEED
COCALUS FEIGNED COMPLIANCE AND INVITED MINOS TO HIS PALACE WHERE HE WAS TREACHEROUSLY PUT TO DEATH IN A WARM BATH THE BODY OF THEIR KING WAS BROUGHT TO AGRIGENT BY THE CRETANS WHERE IT WAS BURIED WITH GREAT POMP AND OVER HIS TOMB A TEMPLE TO APHRODITE WAS ERECTED
IT HAPPENED THAT MISFORTUNE CAME UPON THE MERCHANT SHIPS OF HIS WHICH WERE SAILING THE HIGH SEAS LADEN WITH MERCHANDISE OF GREAT PRICE WERE WRECKED AND IN ONE DAY HE FOUND THAT HE WAS NO LONGER THE RICHEST MERCHANT IN THE CITY BUT A VERY POOR MAN
AND IN A VERY LITTLE TIME CAME BACK WITH BEAUTY'S FATHER AND SISTERS THE SISTERS WERE CONDEMNED TO BE CHANGED INTO STATUES AND TO STAND AT THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE PALACE GATES UNTIL THEIR HEARTS SHOULD BE SOFTENED AND THEY SHOULD BE SORRY FOR THEIR UNKINDNESS TO THEIR SISTER
BUT AS HE WENT THROUGH THE PALACE GATE THE BEAST CALLED TO HIM THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN BEAUTY'S ROSE AND AT THE SAME TIME HELD OUT TO HIM A LARGE BUNCH OF THE VERY BEST THE MERCHANT PUT THESE INTO BEAUTY'S HAND WHEN SHE RAN TO MEET HIM AT THE DOOR OF THEIR COTTAGE
HE KNOCKED AT THE GATES BUT NO ONE ANSWERED AND PRESENTLY DRIVEN BY HUNGER AND COLD HE MADE BOLD TO ENTER AND MOUNTED THE MARBLE STEPS INTO THE GREAT HALL ALL THE WAY HE NEVER SAW A SOUL THERE WAS A BIG FIRE IN THE HALL
HE HASTENED TO FIND HIS DAUGHTERS FOR HE WAS ANXIOUS TO TELL THEM THE GOOD NEWS CONTAINED IN THE LETTER MY DEAR CHILDREN HE SAID AT LAST OUR LUCK HAS TURNED
AND BEGOT A RACE HAVE WE NOT SEEN OR BY RELATION HEARD IN COURTS AND REGAL CHAMBERS HOW THOU LURK'ST IN WOOD OR GROVE BY MOSSY FOUNTAIN SIDE IN VALLEY OR GREEN MEADOW TO WAYLAY SOME BEAUTY RARE CALISTO CLYMENE
THAT FAST TO VIRTUE I IMPUTE NOT OR COUNT PART OF WHAT I SUFFER HERE
WITH SWEET RESTORATIVE DELIGHT ALL THESE ARE SPIRITS OF AIR AND WOODS AND SPRINGS THY GENTLE MINISTERS WHO COME TO PAY THEE HOMAGE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEE THEIR LORD WHAT DOUBT'ST THOU SON OF GOD SIT DOWN AND EAT
TO WHOM THUS JESUS TEMPERATELY REPLIED
BY THE BIRTH I BORE IN SUCH A SEASON BORN WHEN SCARCE A SHED COULD BE OBTAINED TO SHELTER HIM OR ME FROM THE BLEAK AIR A STABLE WAS OUR WARMTH A MANGER HIS YET SOON ENFORCED TO FLY THENCE INTO EGYPT TILL THE MURDEROUS KING WERE DEAD
PLAIN FISHERMEN NO GREATER MEN THEM CALL CLOSE IN A COTTAGE LOW TOGETHER GOT THEIR UNEXPECTED LOSS AND PLAINTS OUTBREATHED
AND DOUBTED MANY DAYS AND AS THE DAYS INCREASED INCREASED THEIR DOUBT SOMETIMES THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE ONLY SHEWN AND FOR A TIME CAUGHT UP TO GOD
OH WHAT AVAILS ME NOW THAT HONOUR HIGH TO HAVE CONCEIVED OF GOD OR THAT SALUTE HAIL HIGHLY FAVOURED AMONG WOMEN BLEST WHILE I TO SORROWS AM NO LESS ADVANCED
FOR I ESTEEM THOSE NAMES OF MEN SO POOR WHO COULD DO MIGHTY THINGS AND COULD CONTEMN RICHES THOUGH OFFERED FROM THE HAND OF KINGS
WHEN ON HIS SHOULDERS EACH MAN'S BURDEN LIES FOR THEREIN STANDS THE OFFICE OF A KING HIS HONOUR VIRTUE MERIT AND CHIEF PRAISE THAT FOR THE PUBLIC ALL THIS WEIGHT HE BEARS YET HE WHO REIGNS WITHIN HIMSELF
THAT TO ALL THINGS I HAD RIGHT

DAPHNE OR SEMELE ANTIOPA
BUT TENDER ALL THEIR POWER NOR MENTION I MEATS BY THE LAW UNCLEAN OR OFFERED FIRST TO IDOLS THOSE YOUNG DANIEL COULD REFUSE NOR PROFFERED BY AN ENEMY
AS THE ZONE OF VENUS ONCE WROUGHT THAT EFFECT ON JOVE SO FABLES TELL
WITH THAT BOTH TABLE AND PROVISION VANISHED QUITE WITH SOUND OF HARPIES WINGS AND TALONS HEARD ONLY THE IMPORTUNE TEMPTER STILL REMAINED AND WITH THESE WORDS HIS TEMPTATION PURSUED
AND RULES PASSIONS DESIRES AND FEARS IS MORE A KING WHICH EVERY WISE AND VIRTUOUS MAN ATTAINS AND WHO ATTAINS NOT ILL ASPIRES TO RULE CITIES OF MEN
HIM THOUGHT HE BY THE BROOK OF CHERITH STOOD AND SAW THE RAVENS WITH THEIR HORNY BEAKS FOOD TO ELIJAH BRINGING EVEN AND MORN THOUGH RAVENOUS TAUGHT TO ABSTAIN FROM WHAT THEY BROUGHT HE SAW THE PROPHET ALSO
WHERE ALL HIS POTENTATES IN COUNCIL SATE
AND THE TEMPTER NOW HIS INVITATION EARNESTLY RENEWED WHAT DOUBTS THE SON OF GOD TO SIT AND EAT THESE ARE NOT FRUITS FORBIDDEN NO INTERDICT
OTHERS OF SOME NOTE AS STORY TELLS HAVE TROD THIS WILDERNESS THE FUGITIVE BOND WOMAN WITH HER SON OUTCAST NEBAIOTH
THAT SEEMED FAIRER THAN FEIGNED OF OLD OR FABLED SINCE OF FAERY DAMSELS MET IN FOREST WIDE BY KNIGHTS OF LOGRES

WHY SHOULDST THOU NOT ACCEPT IT BUT I SEE WHAT I CAN DO OR OFFER IS SUSPECT

WHEN FROM AMIDST THEM ROSE BELIAL
AS THE MAGNETIC HARDEST IRON DRAWS WOMEN WHEN NOTHING ELSE BEGUILED THE HEART OF WISEST SOLOMON
HE CEASED AND HEARD THEIR GRANT IN LOUD ACCLAIM THEN FORTHWITH TO HIM TAKES A CHOSEN BAND OF SPIRITS LIKEST TO HIMSELF IN GUILE TO BE AT HAND AND AT HIS BECK APPEAR
GOD OF ISRAEL SEND THY MESSIAH FORTH THE TIME IS COME BEHOLD THE KINGS OF THE EARTH HOW THEY OPPRESS THY CHOSEN TO WHAT HIGHTH THEIR POWER UNJUST THEY HAVE EXALTED AND BEHIND THEM CAST ALL FEAR OF THEE ARISE AND VINDICATE THY GLORY
BUT MEN ENDUED WITH THESE HAVE OFT ATTAINED IN LOWEST POVERTY TO HIGHEST DEEDS GIDEON AND JEPHTHA
HEAVEN'S ANCIENT SONS A ETHEREAL THRONES DAEMONIAN SPIRITS NOW FROM THE ELEMENT EACH OF HIS REIGN ALLOTTED RIGHTLIER CALLED POWERS OF FIRE AIR WATER AND EARTH BENEATH SO MAY WE HOLD OUR PLACE AND THESE MILD SEATS WITHOUT NEW TROUBLE
TO WHOM QUICK ANSWER SATAN THUS RETURNED
BUT THESE HAUNTS DELIGHT NOT ALL AMONG THE SONS OF MEN HOW MANY HAVE WITH A SMILE MADE SMALL ACCOUNT OF BEAUTY AND HER LURES EASILY SCORNED ALL HER ASSAULTS ON WORTHIER THINGS INTENT
NOW HUNGERING FIRST AND TO HIMSELF THUS SAID WHERE WILL THIS END FOUR TIMES TEN DAYS I HAVE PASSED WANDERING THIS WOODY MAZE AND HUMAN FOOD NOR TASTED NOR HAD APPETITE
DISTANT MORE UNDER THE TREES NOW TRIPPED NOW SOLEMN STOOD NYMPHS OF DIANA'S TRAIN AND NAIADES WITH FRUITS AND FLOWERS FROM AMALTHEA'S HORN AND LADIES OF THE HESPERIDES
COMMIT TO ME I SHALL LET PASS NO ADVANTAGE
MOCK US WITH HIS BLEST SIGHT THEN SNATCH HIM HENCE SOON WE SHALL SEE OUR HOPE OUR JOY RETURN THUS THEY OUT OF THEIR PLAINTS NEW HOPE RESUME TO FIND WHOM AT THE FIRST THEY FOUND UNSOUGHT
BEHOLD NATURE ASHAMED OR BETTER TO EXPRESS TROUBLED THAT THOU SHOULDST HUNGER HATH PURVEYED FROM ALL THE ELEMENTS HER CHOICEST STORE TO TREAT THEE AS BESEEMS AND AS HER LORD WITH HONOUR ONLY DEIGN TO SIT AND EAT
TO WHOM THUS ANSWERED SATAN MALE CONTENT THAT I HAVE ALSO POWER TO GIVE THOU SEEST IF OF THAT POWER I BRING THEE VOLUNTARY WHAT I MIGHT HAVE BESTOWED ON WHOM I PLEASED AND RATHER OPPORTUNELY IN THIS PLACE CHOSE TO IMPART TO THY APPARENT NEED
AND ON THAT HIGH AUTHORITY HAD BELIEVED AND WITH HIM TALKED AND WITH HIM LODGED I MEAN ANDREW AND SIMON FAMOUS AFTER KNOWN WITH OTHERS
THEREAFTER AS I LIKE THE GIVER ANSWERED JESUS WHY SHOULD THAT CAUSE THY REFUSAL SAID THE SUBTLE FIEND HAST THOU NOT RIGHT TO ALL CREATED THINGS OWE NOT ALL CREATURES BY JUST RIGHT TO THEE DUTY AND SERVICE NOR TO STAY TILL BID
WITH GRANTED LEAVE OFFICIOUS I RETURN BUT MUCH MORE WONDER THAT THE SON OF GOD IN THIS WILD SOLITUDE SO LONG SHOULD BIDE OF ALL THINGS DESTITUTE AND WELL I KNOW NOT WITHOUT HUNGER
NOR LEFT AT JORDAN TIDINGS OF HIM NONE WITHIN HER BREAST THOUGH CALM HER BREAST THOUGH PURE MOTHERLY CARES AND FEARS GOT HEAD AND RAISED SOME TROUBLED THOUGHTS WHICH SHE IN SIGHS THUS CLAD
THE FLESHLIEST INCUBUS AND THUS ADVISED SET WOMEN IN HIS EYE AND IN HIS WALK AMONG DAUGHTERS OF MEN THE FAIREST FOUND MANY ARE IN EACH REGION PASSING FAIR AS THE NOON SKY
AND ALL THE WHILE HARMONIOUS AIRS WERE HEARD OF CHIMING STRINGS OR CHARMING PIPES AND WINDS OF GENTLEST GALE ARABIAN ODOURS FANNED FROM THEIR SOFT WINGS AND FLORA'S EARLIEST SMELLS SUCH WAS THE SPLENDOUR
OR FROM WHAT HOPE DOST THOU ASPIRE TO GREATNESS WHENCE AUTHORITY DERIV'ST WHAT FOLLOWERS WHAT RETINUE CANST THOU GAIN
AND GREET HER WITH HIS SONG AS LIGHTLY FROM HIS GRASSY COUCH UP ROSE OUR SAVIOUR AND FOUND ALL WAS BUT A DREAM FASTING HE WENT TO SLEEP AND FASTING WAKED UP TO A HILL ANON HIS STEPS HE REARED FROM WHOSE HIGH TOP TO KEN THE PROSPECT ROUND
BUT NOW I FEEL I HUNGER WHICH DECLARES NATURE HATH NEED OF WHAT SHE ASKS YET GOD CAN SATISFY THAT NEED SOME OTHER WAY THOUGH HUNGER STILL REMAIN SO IT REMAIN WITHOUT THIS BODY'S WASTING I CONTENT ME
THIS IS MY FAVOURED LOT MY EXALTATION TO AFFLICTIONS HIGH AFFLICTED I MAY BE IT SEEMS AND BLEST I WILL NOT ARGUE THAT
OR LAWLESS PASSIONS IN HIM WHICH HE SERVES BUT TO GUIDE NATIONS IN THE WAY OF TRUTH BY SAVING DOCTRINE AND FROM ERROR LEAD TO KNOW AND KNOWING WORSHIP GOD ARIGHT IS YET MORE KINGLY
I CAN AT WILL DOUBT NOT AS SOON AS THOU COMMAND A TABLE IN THIS WILDERNESS AND CALL SWIFT FLIGHTS OF ANGELS MINISTRANT ARRAYED IN GLORY ON MY CUP TO ATTEND WHY SHOULDST THOU THEN OBTRUDE THIS DILIGENCE IN VAIN WHERE NO ACCEPTANCE IT CAN FIND
AND THAT PROPHET BOLD NATIVE OF THEBEZ WANDERING HERE WAS FED TWICE BY A VOICE INVITING HIM TO EAT
THUS MARY PONDERING OFT AND OFT TO MIND RECALLING WHAT REMARKABLY HAD PASSED SINCE FIRST HER SALUTATION HEARD WITH THOUGHTS MEEKLY COMPOSED AWAITED THE FULFILLING THE WHILE HER SON TRACING THE DESERT WILD SOLE
THEREFORE IF AT GREAT THINGS THOU WOULDST ARRIVE GET RICHES FIRST GET WEALTH AND TREASURE HEAP NOT DIFFICULT IF THOU HEARKEN TO ME
AND FROM THE STING OF FAMINE FEAR NO HARM NOR MIND IT FED WITH BETTER THOUGHTS THAT FEED ME HUNGERING MORE TO DO MY FATHER'S WILL
PERFECTIONS ABSOLUTE GRACES DIVINE AND AMPLITUDE OF MIND TO GREATEST DEEDS THEREFORE I AM RETURNED
WHO SOUGHT HIS LIFE AND MISSING FILLED WITH INFANT BLOOD THE STREETS OF BETHLEHEM FROM EGYPT HOME RETURNED IN NAZARETH HATH BEEN OUR DWELLING MANY YEARS
HE SPAKE NO DREAM FOR AS HIS WORDS HAD END OUR SAVIOUR LIFTING UP HIS EYES BEHELD IN AMPLE SPACE UNDER THE BROADEST SHADE
I REJECT RICHES AND REALMS
THE KINGDOM SHALL TO ISRAEL BE RESTORED THUS WE REJOICED BUT SOON OUR JOY IS TURNED INTO PERPLEXITY AND NEW AMAZE FOR WHITHER IS HE GONE WHAT ACCIDENT HATH RAPT HIM FROM US
BUT FIND FAR OTHER LABOUR TO BE UNDERGONE THAN WHEN I DEALT WITH ADAM FIRST OF MEN THOUGH ADAM BY HIS WIFE'S ALLUREMENT FELL HOWEVER TO THIS MAN INFERIOR FAR IF HE BE MAN BY MOTHER'S SIDE AT LEAST WITH MORE THAN HUMAN GIFTS FROM HEAVEN ADORNED
SUCH OBJECT HATH THE POWER TO SOFTEN AND TAME SEVEREST TEMPER SMOOTH THE RUGGED'ST BROW ENERVE AND WITH VOLUPTUOUS HOPE DISSOLVE DRAW OUT WITH CREDULOUS DESIRE AND LEAD AT WILL THE MANLIEST RESOLUTEST BREAST
AND SAVOUR BEASTS OF CHASE OR FOWL OF GAME IN PASTRY BUILT OR FROM THE SPIT OR BOILED GRISAMBER STEAMED ALL FISH FROM SEA OR SHORE FRESHET OR PURLING BROOK OF SHELL OR FIN AND EXQUISITEST NAME
TO WHOM THUS JESUS WHAT CONCLUD'ST THOU HENCE THEY ALL HAD NEED I AS THOU SEEST HAVE NONE HOW HAST THOU HUNGER THEN SATAN REPLIED
AND WITH HIM WE HAVE CONVERSED LET US BE GLAD OF THIS AND ALL OUR FEARS LAY ON HIS PROVIDENCE HE WILL NOT FAIL NOR WILL WITHDRAW HIM NOW NOR WILL RECALL
EXPERT IN AMOROUS ARTS ENCHANTING TONGUES PERSUASIVE
BY HUNGER THAT EACH OTHER CREATURE TAMES THOU ART NOT TO BE HARMED THEREFORE NOT MOVED THY TEMPERANCE INVINCIBLE BESIDES FOR NO ALLUREMENT YIELDS TO APPETITE
AS HAVE MORE SHEW OF WORTH OF HONOUR GLORY AND POPULAR PRAISE ROCKS WHEREON GREATEST MEN HAVE OFTEST WRECKED
SUCH AN ENEMY IS RISEN TO INVADE US WHO NO LESS THREATENS THAN OUR EXPULSION DOWN TO HELL
BUT I TO WAIT WITH PATIENCE AM INURED MY HEART HATH BEEN A STOREHOUSE LONG OF THINGS AND SAYINGS LAID UP PRETENDING STRANGE EVENTS
FOR WHICH WAS DRAINED PONTUS AND LUCRINE BAY AND AFRIC COAST ALAS HOW SIMPLE TO THESE CATES COMPARED WAS THAT CRUDE APPLE THAT DIVERTED EVE
TO WHOM THUS JESUS PATIENTLY REPLIED YET WEALTH WITHOUT THESE THREE IS IMPOTENT TO GAIN DOMINION OR TO KEEP IT GAINED WITNESS THOSE ANCIENT EMPIRES OF THE EARTH IN HIGHTH OF ALL THEIR FLOWING WEALTH DISSOLVED
THEN HOW AWAKED HE FOUND HIS SUPPER ON THE COALS PREPARED AND BY THE ANGEL WAS BID RISE AND EAT AND EAT THE SECOND TIME AFTER REPOSE THE STRENGTH WHEREOF SUFFICED HIM FORTY DAYS SOMETIMES THAT WITH ELIJAH HE PARTOOK
BECAUSE OF OLD THOU THYSELF DOAT'ST ON WOMANKIND ADMIRING THEIR SHAPE THEIR COLOUR AND ATTRACTIVE GRACE NONE ARE THOU THINK'ST BUT TAKEN WITH SUCH TOYS BEFORE THE FLOOD THOU WITH THY LUSTY CREW FALSE TITLED SONS OF GOD
BUT NOW FULL GROWN TO MAN ACKNOWLEDGED AS I HEAR BY JOHN THE BAPTIST AND IN PUBLIC SHEWN SON OWNED FROM HEAVEN BY HIS FATHER'S VOICE I LOOKED FOR SOME GREAT CHANGE TO HONOUR NO BUT TROUBLE
FREE THY PEOPLE FROM THEIR YOKE BUT LET US WAIT THUS FAR HE HATH PERFORMED SENT HIS ANOINTED
DISCOUNTENANCE HER DESPISED AND PUT TO ROUT ALL HER ARRAY HER FEMALE PRIDE DEJECT OR TURN TO REVERENT AWE
MANY MORE TOO LONG THEN LAY'ST THY SCAPES ON NAMES ADORED
OUR EYES BEHELD MESSIAH CERTAINLY NOW COME SO LONG EXPECTED OF OUR FATHERS WE HAVE HEARD HIS WORDS HIS WISDOM FULL OF GRACE AND TRUTH NOW NOW FOR SURE DELIVERANCE IS AT HAND
AS OLD SIMEON PLAIN FORETOLD THAT TO THE FALL AND RISING HE SHOULD BE OF MANY IN ISRAEL AND TO A SIGN SPOKEN AGAINST
AND WITH MY HUNGER WHAT HAST THOU TO DO
SOME GREAT INTENT CONCEALS HIM WHEN TWELVE YEARS HE SCARCE HAD SEEN I LOST HIM BUT SO FOUND AS WELL I SAW HE COULD NOT LOSE HIMSELF BUT WENT ABOUT HIS FATHER'S BUSINESS WHAT HE MEANT I MUSED SINCE UNDERSTAND
I AM A BACHELOR I KNEW AN HONEST WIDOW WHO RESIDED IN A LANE AND WHO HAD TWO FURNISHED ROOMS I PERSUADE THE YOUNG COUNTESS TO FOLLOW ME AND WE TAKE A GONDOLA
TAUGHT ME ANOTHER OF HIS MASTERLY LESSONS I HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED THROUGH ZAWOISKI WITH A FRENCHMAN CALLED L'ABBADIE WHO WAS THEN SOLICITING FROM THE VENETIAN GOVERNMENT THE APPOINTMENT OF INSPECTOR OF THE ARMIES OF THE REPUBLIC THE SENATE APPOINTED
I FOUND OUT ONLY YESTERDAY THAT THE MAN WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY INTELLIGENT TO FILL THE POSITION HE WAS SOLICITING IS HE LIKELY TO POSSESS A SANE JUDGMENT WHEN HE REFUSES TO LEND YOU ONE HUNDRED SEQUINS
I LEFT HER AFTER BREAKFAST AND IN THE EVENING I CAME BACK WITH A BASKET FULL OF GOOD BOOKS AND MUSIC AND I SENT HER AN EXCELLENT HARPSICHORD MY KINDNESS CONFUSED HER BUT I SURPRISED HER MUCH MORE WHEN I TOOK OUT OF MY POCKET THREE PAIRS OF SLIPPERS
WITHOUT GIVING HER TIME TO ANSWER I TOLD HER ALL THE PARTICULARS I HAD LEARNED CONCERNING HER HONOURABLE FAMILY WHICH CAUSED HER REAL SATISFACTION I HAVE NO OBJECTION SHE SAID TO YOUR GOING TO C AND I THANK YOU FOR THE GENEROSITY OF YOUR OFFER
I WILL SPEAK OF HIM IN ANOTHER PART OF THESE MEMOIRS THIS AMIABLE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS A FAVOURITE WITH EVERYBODY AND WAS THOUGHT A FREE THINKER BECAUSE HE FREQUENTED THE SOCIETY OF ANGELO QUERINI AND LUNARDO VENIER
AND THAT OF COURSE WAS NOT THE RIGHT ONE ONE HOUR BEFORE MIDNIGHT I LEFT MY FATHER'S ROOF ALONE THUS COMPLETING MY DISHONOUR
AND WHAT WE MAY COMPEL HIM TO DO UNTIL THEN MY ADVICE IS NOT TO LET HIM KNOW YOUR ARRIVAL IN VENICE GOOD GOD WHERE SHALL I GO TO NIGHT TO A RESPECTABLE HOUSE OF COURSE I WILL GO TO YOURS IF YOU ARE MARRIED
I WAS STRUCK BY THE WORDS SHE HAD JUST UTTERED AND I FELT THAT THOSE WORDS AS WELL AS HER LOOKS HAD FOUND THEIR WAY TO MY HEART BESIDES ENLISTING MY GENEROUS SYMPATHY I TOOK THE STILETTO
AS SOON AS SHE HAD OPENED HER DOOR I ENTERED HER ROOM AND CUTTING SHORT HER APOLOGIES FOR HAVING KEPT ME WAITING I INFORMED HER OF ALL I HAD HEARD HER FEATURES BORE THE STAMP OF DEEP SORROW BUT SHE LOOKED CALMER AND HER COMPLEXION WAS NO LONGER PALE
BUT RESOLVED ON DEATH IF THE MAN WHO HAS CRUELLY ROBBED ME OF MY MOST PRECIOUS TREASURE AND WHOM A NATURAL INSTINCT TOLD ME I COULD FIND HERE DOES NOT RESTORE ME THE HONOUR WHICH HE ALONE CAN GIVE ME BACK I WALKED ALL NIGHT AND NEARLY THE WHOLE DAY WITHOUT TAKING ANY FOOD
AND FELT PLEASED AT THE IDEA SHE EVIDENTLY ENTERTAINED OF MY KIND ATTENTIONS I HAD NO OTHER PURPOSE IN VIEW BUT TO RESTORE CALM TO HER MIND AND TO OBLITERATE THE BAD OPINION WHICH THE UNWORTHY STEFFANI HAD GIVEN HER OF MEN IN GENERAL
BUT I DID NOT GO AGAIN TO COUNT RINALDI'S WHOM I SAW SIXTEEN YEARS AFTERWARDS IN MILAN AS TO ZAWOISKI I DID NOT TELL HIM THE STORY TILL I MET HIM IN CARLSBAD OLD AND DEAF FORTY YEARS LATER THREE OR FOUR MONTHS LATER
THAT REFUSAL HAS COST HIM AN IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT AND AN INCOME OF THREE THOUSAND CROWNS WHICH WOULD NOW BE HIS WHEN I WAS TAKING MY WALK ON THE SAME DAY I MET ZAWOISKI WITH L'ABBADIE AND DID NOT TRY TO AVOID THEM
IF AT THE END YOU LOSE WHY AN IDIOT FORTUNE IS VERY FICKLE
WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO HAVE SOME BREAKFAST WITH YOU
BUT I BEG YOU WILL POSTPONE YOUR JOURNEY I STILL HOPE THAT STEFFANI WILL RETURN AND THEN I CAN TAKE A DECISION
WHICH WAS NOT MY USUAL TIME HAVING RESOLVED ON CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY MYSELF I CAUGHT HER SEATED BEFORE A TOILET GLASS WHILE THE WIDOW DRESSED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AUBURN HAIR I HAD EVER SEEN I TENDERED MY APOLOGIES FOR MY SUDDEN APPEARANCE AT AN UNUSUAL HOUR
AND FAR FROM EXPERIENCING ANY REPUGNANCE I FELT THAT I WAS ACTING RIGHTLY IN TRUSTING MYSELF IN YOUR HANDS IN SPITE OF ALL PRUDENCE WHICH PERHAPS
AND ALMOST DETERMINED ON DECLARING MY PASSION
BUT YOU MAY IMAGINE THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED UPON ME BY THE SUDDEN APPARITION OF A MASKED MAN WHO ABRUPTLY AND AS IF PLACED THERE PURPOSELY BY PROVIDENCE OFFERED ME HIS SERVICES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT YOU HAD GUESSED MY DISTRESS
HAPPENING TO BE SEATED NEXT TO AN ABBE FROM BOLOGNA AT THE THEATRE I ASKED HIM SEVERAL QUESTIONS RESPECTING THE FAMILY OF MY UNFORTUNATE PROTEGEE THE ABBE BEING INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THEM
WHEN WE MET IN THE MORNING HE KINDLY ENCOURAGED ME TO CONFESS MY TROUBLES TO HIM I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS MY ONLY CHANCE AND CANDIDLY RELATED THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND I ENDED BY SAYING THAT I SHOULD NOT SURVIVE MY DISGRACE
AND DEEPLY IN DEBT BUT THAT HE WOULD BE RICH AFTER HIS MOTHER'S DEATH FOR GOD'S SAKE TAKE ME TO HIS HOUSE I WILL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH BUT HAVE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN ME AND BE GOOD ENOUGH TO HEAR ME I ADVISE YOU NOT TO GO TO HIS HOUSE
YOUR COWARDLY SEDUCER MUST PAY WITH HIS LIFE THE PENALTY DUE TO HIS CRIME AND HE OUGHT NEVER TO RECEIVE BY MARRYING YOU AN UNJUST REWARD
SHE PUT HER HAND IN HER POCKET AND DREW FORTH AFTER A FEW MOMENTS CONSIDERATION A STILETTO SIX INCHES LONG WHICH SHE PLACED ON THE TABLE
I NEVER THOUGHT OF INSPIRING HER WITH LOVE FOR ME AND I HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA THAT I COULD FALL IN LOVE WITH HER SHE WAS UNHAPPY AND HER UNHAPPINESS A SACRED THING IN MY EYES
COUNT RINALDI HAVING OFFERED TO GIVE US OUR REVENGE AS I HAD NO MORE MONEY I PLAYED UPON TRUST AND THE COUNT THREW DOWN THE CARDS AFTER I HAD LOST FIVE HUNDRED SEQUINS I WENT AWAY IN GREAT SORROW
SHE BLUSHED AND THANKED ME WITH GREAT FEELING SHE HAD WALKED A LONG DISTANCE HER SHOES WERE EVIDENTLY WORN OUT HER FEET SORE AND SHE APPRECIATED THE DELICACY OF MY PRESENT AS I HAD NO IMPROPER DESIGN WITH REGARD TO HER I ENJOYED HER GRATITUDE
I TOLD HER UNSPARINGLY THAT STEFFANI HAD SEDUCED AND ABANDONED HER OF MALICE AFORETHOUGHT AND THAT SHE OUGHT TO THINK OF HIM ONLY TO BE REVENGED OF HIS PERFIDY MY WORDS MADE HER SHUDDER AND SHE BURIED HER BEAUTIFUL FACE IN HER HANDS WE REACHED THE WIDOW'S HOUSE
IF YOU SHOULD TELL HER WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT IS YOUR ERRAND TRUST TO ME AND BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT GOD HAS SENT ME ON YOUR WAY TO ASSIST YOU I PROMISE YOU THAT TO MORROW AT THE LATEST YOU SHALL KNOW WHETHER STEFFANI IS IN VENICE WHAT HE INTENDS TO DO WITH YOU
HE CONSOLED ME BY PROMISING THAT MY DEBT WOULD BE CANCELLED IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY IF I WOULD SWEAR NEVER TO PLAY AGAIN UPON TRUST I TOOK AN OATH TO THAT EFFECT AND KISSING HIS HAND I WENT OUT FOR A WALK RELIEVED FROM A GREAT LOAD
BUT IF YOU WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO COME WITH ME TO A CAFE
THE SENATE HAS REJECTED HIS NOMINATION HOW SO THREE DAYS AGO L'ABBADIE FELT SURE OF HIS SUCCESS HE WAS RIGHT THEN FOR HE WOULD HAVE BEEN APPOINTED IF I HAD NOT MADE UP MY MIND TO SPEAK AGAINST HIM
AND THEN DECEIVED HER THUS SEALING HER EVERLASTING MISERY YOU HAVE THEN SOME HOPE OF RECALLING HIM TO THE PATH OF DUTY I SUPPOSE HE HAS PROMISED YOU MARRIAGE HE HAS ENGAGED HIS FAITH TO ME IN WRITING THE ONLY FAVOUR I CLAIM FROM YOUR KINDNESS
THAT SINGULAR MEETING WHICH GAVE ME THE USEFUL OPPORTUNITY OF FINDING MYSELF ENDOWED WITH GENEROUS DISPOSITIONS
MAKE THE BANK AND THE ADVANTAGE MUST BE ON YOUR SIDE YES BUT ONLY A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE AS SLIGHT AS YOU PLEASE BUT IT WILL BE ON YOUR SIDE AND WHEN THE GAME IS OVER YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF A WINNER AND NOT A LOSER THE PUNTER IS EXCITED
WE SOON BECAME GOOD FRIENDS MY PURSE WAS HIS BUT TWENTY YEARS LATER HE ASSISTED ME TO A FAR GREATER EXTENT IN MUNICH ZAWOISKI WAS HONEST HE HAD ONLY A SMALL DOSE OF INTELLIGENCE BUT IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIS HAPPINESS
AS SHE WAS AGAIN THANKING ME FOR THE BOOKS I HAD GIVEN HER SAYING THAT I HAD GUESSED HER TASTE EXACTLY BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE NOVELS SHE ADDED I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY FOR NOT HAVING SUNG TO YOU YET KNOWING THAT YOU ARE FOND OF MUSIC THESE WORDS
I HAD THE COURAGE TO SMOTHER MY ARDENT DESIRES AND THE KISS I IMPRINTED ON HER LOVELY HAND WAS A MIXTURE OF TENDERNESS RESPECT AND ADMIRATION I TOOK LEAVE OF HER SMITTEN FULL OF LOVE
IT WAS A PROMISE OF MARRIAGE BY WHICH HE ENGAGED HIS WORD OF HONOUR TO MARRY WITHIN A WEEK IN VENICE THE YOUNG COUNTESS A S WHEN I HAVE READ THE PAPER I RETURN IT TO HER SAYING THAT I KNEW THE WRITER QUITE WELL THAT HE WAS CONNECTED WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE KNOWN AS A GREAT LIBERTINE
AND A PARCEL HE READ THE LETTER ASKED ME TO FOLLOW HIM INTO HIS STUDY AND THE MOMENT WE WERE ALONE HE SAID HERE IS A PARCEL FOR YOU I OPENED IT AND FOUND SOME FORTY SEQUINS SEEING MY SURPRISE
UNTIL I GOT INTO THE BARGE WHICH BROUGHT ME HERE IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS I TRAVELLED IN THE BOAT WITH FIVE MEN AND TWO WOMEN BUT NO ONE SAW MY FACE OR HEARD MY VOICE I KEPT CONSTANTLY SITTING DOWN IN A CORNER HOLDING MY HEAD DOWN HALF ASLEEP
HE SWORE A THOUSAND TIMES THAT HE ADORED ME THAT HIS INTENTIONS WERE HONOURABLE I ENTREATED HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF TO MY PARENTS TO ASK ME IN MARRIAGE
IT IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE LEAVE OFF PLAYING BELIEVE ME THE VERY MOMENT YOU SEE LUCK TURNING EVEN IF YOU SHOULD AT THAT MOMENT WIN BUT ONE GROAT I HAD READ PLATO AND I WAS ASTONISHED AT FINDING A MAN WHO COULD REASON LIKE SOCRATES
WITH BLACK HAIR YOU ARE MISTAKEN SHE SAID IT IS A PORTRAIT OF MY BROTHER HE IS TWO YEARS OLDER THAN I AND IS AN OFFICER IN THE PAPAL ARMY I BEGGED HER PERMISSION TO PUT THE RING ON HER FINGER SHE CONSENTED
L'ABBADIE WAS FURIOUS AND HE HAD SOME REASON TO BE SO
AND SHE SANG AT SIGHT IN A MANNER WHICH FAIRLY RAVISHED ME I BEGGED THAT SHE WOULD ALLOW ME TO KISS HER HAND AND SHE DID NOT SAY YES BUT WHEN I TOOK IT AND PRESSED MY LIPS ON IT SHE DID NOT OPPOSE ANY RESISTANCE
BUT UNWILLING TO FORM A HASTY JUDGMENT I KEPT ON MY GUARD WITH A FIRM DETERMINATION TO MAKE GOOD USE OF THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT MIGHT PRESENT ITSELF TO CLEAR UP MY DOUBTS I CALLED UPON HER THE NEXT DAY AFTER DINNER
HE MERELY REMARKED THAT THE FRENCHMAN WAS DEFICIENT IN INTELLIGENCE IT JUST HAPPENED THAT IT WAS THE VERY DAY ON WHICH THE APPOINTMENT OF THE INSPECTORSHIP WAS TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE SENATE I WENT OUT TO ATTEND TO MY BUSINESS I OUGHT TO SAY TO MY PLEASURE
AND HER HUSBAND HAVING LEFT US ALONE SHE HAD THE ART TO LET ME HOPE FOR EVERY FAVOUR YET WITHOUT COMMITTING HERSELF WHEN I TOOK LEAVE OF HER SHE INVITED ME TO SUPPER FOR THE EVENING AFTER SUPPER I PLAYED
AND I PRESENTED HIM TO MY PROTECTOR WHO PROMISED HIM HIS VOTE BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE I AM GOING TO RELATE PREVENTED HIM FROM FULFILLING HIS PROMISE
THE NEXT DAY ZAWOISKI CALLED ON ME VERY EARLY TO TELL ME THAT I HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO SUPPER AND THAT COUNT RINALDI HAD PRAISED MY PROMPTNESS IN PAYING MY DEBTS OF HONOUR I DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO UNDECEIVE HIM
WHEN I APPEARED BEFORE HER WITH A MASK ON MY FACE IN A COSTUME WHICH DID NOT INDICATE A VERY VIRTUOUS CHARACTER IT WAS EASY FOR ME MADAM I CONTINUED TO GUESS THAT YOU WERE A BEAUTY IN DISTRESS WHEN I OBSERVED YOUR YOUTH THE NOBLENESS OF YOUR COUNTENANCE
I WAS THUS ENGAGED IN A RATHER DELICATE ADVENTURE THE END OF WHICH I COULD NOT POSSIBLY FORESEE BUT MY WARMTH FOR MY PROTEGEE DID NOT COOL DOWN AND HAVING NO DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING THE MEANS TO KEEP HER I HAD NO WISH TO SEE THE LAST SCENE OF THE ROMANCE
SHE HESITATES I INSIST AND SHE GIVES WAY THE TAVERN WAS CLOSE AT HAND
I HAVE PROVED TO THE SENATE THAT A RIGHT POLICY FORBADE THE GOVERNMENT TO TRUST SUCH AN IMPORTANT POST TO A FOREIGNER I AM MUCH SURPRISED FOR YOUR EXCELLENCY WAS NOT OF THAT OPINION THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY VERY TRUE
THE MORE YOU WILL SAVE FOR YOU WILL ALWAYS BE COMPELLED TO ACCEPT YOUR DISHONOUR WHENEVER YOU FIND YOURSELF UTTERLY UNABLE TO PAY YOUR LOSSES IT IS THEREFORE MORE PRUDENT NOT TO WAIT UNTIL THEN
AND I REMAINED RATHER ASHAMED WHEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD BEEN THE DUPE OF THE WIFE AS WELL AS OF THE HUSBAND THIS EVENING SAID MY CLEVER PHYSICIAN YOU CAN HAVE A GAY SUPPER WITH THE CHARMING COUNTESS THIS EVENING MY DEAR RESPECTED BENEFACTOR
HE HAS ALREADY DONE YOU GREAT INJURY AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO FIND HIM AT HOME HE MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF RECEIVING YOU BADLY IF HE SHOULD NOT BE AT HOME IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT HIS MOTHER WOULD NOT EXACTLY WELCOME YOU
SEEING HER ALONE AND OBSERVING HER UNCERTAIN WALK I FELT MYSELF DRAWN TOWARDS HER AS IF AN UNSEEN HAND HAD GUIDED ME I COME UP TO HER AND OFFER MY SERVICES IF I CAN BE OF ANY USE TO HER
ONE MONTH AGO I HAD NEVER COMMITTED A FAULT WHICH COULD CALL A BLUSH UPON MY FACE AND THE BITTER TEARS WHICH I SHED EVERY DAY WILL I HOPE WASH OUT MY CRIME IN THE EYES OF GOD I HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY BROUGHT UP BUT LOVE AND THE WANT OF EXPERIENCE
I FELT THAT IT GAVE NEW STRENGTH TO MY HOPES AND THAT FEELING PREVENTED ME FROM REGRETTING MY HEAVY LOSS BUT GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT GENEROSITY OF MY BENEFACTOR I WAS FULLY DETERMINED ON KEEPING MY PROMISE
SHORTLY AFTER OUR MARRIAGE ALAS SIR WHAT SHALL I SAY NOW LOVE BLINDED ME I FELL INTO THE ABYSS I BELIEVED HIM I AGREED TO EVERYTHING HE GAVE ME THE PAPER WHICH YOU HAVE READ
YET I FELT MY LOVE TAKING SUCH PROPORTIONS THAT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO KEEP IT A MYSTERY ANY LONGER SOON AFTER THAT
I MUST THINK OF DEFENDING MYSELF AGAINST MY OWN SELF MUCH MORE THAN AGAINST YOU THE COMPLIMENT STRUCK ME AS SO FINE AND SO COMPLIMENTARY TO ME THAT I THOUGHT IT BETTER NOT TO TAKE IT UP
SHE HAD NOT OPENED IT ONCE FOR THE WIDOW HAD TOLD ME SO IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE BEST WAY TO THANK ME FOR MY ATTENTIVE KINDNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN TO GIVE ME A SPECIMEN OF HER MUSICAL TALENT HAD SHE DECEIVED ME IF SO SHE WOULD LOSE MY ESTEEM
MADE ME BREATHE FREELY WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY ANSWER SHE SAT DOWN BEFORE THE INSTRUMENT AND PLAYED SEVERAL PIECES WITH A FACILITY WITH A PRECISION WITH AN EXPRESSION OF WHICH
AND AFTER SHE HAD EXCUSED HERSELF FOR NOT HAVING BEEN AT HOME IN THE MORNING THE FARO BANK BEGAN AND I LOST ALL MY MONEY STILL HAVING THE COUNTESS FOR MY PARTNER AFTER SUPPER AND WHEN THE OTHER GUESTS HAD RETIRED I REMAINED WITH ZAWOISKI
I MUST EXPLAIN HOW A CERTAIN SUSPICION OF THE YOUNG LADY AROSE IN MY MIND THAT DOUBT WAS HEAVY ON MY HEART FOR IF IT HAD PROVED TRUE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DUPE AND THE IDEA WAS HUMILIATING SHE HAD TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS A MUSICIAN
AND WITH THIS PRAYER BOOK IN MY HANDS I WAS LEFT ALONE NO ONE SPOKE TO ME AND I THANKED GOD FOR IT WHEN I LANDED ON THE WHARF YOU DID NOT GIVE ME TIME TO THINK HOW I COULD FIND OUT THE DWELLING OF MY PERFIDIOUS SEDUCER
MAY BE SURE THAT OUR PLAYING LAST NIGHT WAS ONLY A JOKE HE OWES ME NOTHING MY WIFE BEGS TO SEND HIM HALF OF THE GOLD WHICH HE HAS LOST IN CASH COUNT RINALDI
I WAS UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH SHE CONTINUED TO INSPIRE HIM WITH LOVE AND HE POSTPONED HIS DEPARTURE HE REMAINED ONE MONTH IN C NEVER GOING OUT BUT IN THE EVENING AND SPENDING EVERY NIGHT UNDER MY WINDOWS CONVERSING WITH ME
I BLUSHED FOR VERY SHAME FOR I OUGHT TO HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT AS SOON AS THE WIDOW HAD DRESSED HER HAIR SHE LEFT THE ROOM TO PREPARE SOME COFFEE FOR US I TOOK UP A RING WHICH HAD BEEN LAID BY HER ON THE TOILET TABLE
AND THE FOLLOWING NIGHT I ALLOWED HIM TO COME INTO MY ROOM THROUGH THE WINDOW UNDER WHICH HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF CONVERSING WITH ME I CONSENTED TO BE GUILTY OF A CRIME WHICH I BELIEVED WOULD BE ATONED FOR WITHIN THREE DAYS AND HE LEFT ME
I WILL HAVE SUPPER WITH YOU YOU HAVE GIVEN ME A MASTERLY LESSON THE NEXT TIME YOU LOSE MONEY UPON TRUST YOU HAD BETTER NOT PAY IT BUT I SHOULD BE DISHONOURED NEVER MIND THE SOONER YOU DISHONOUR YOURSELF
THE COUNT MADE A FARO BANK IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING I PUNTED WITH HIS WIFE AS A PARTNER
OUGHT TO HAVE MADE ME TURN A DEAF EAR TO YOUR WORDS AND REFUSE THE INVITATION TO ENTER ALONE WITH YOU THE HOUSE TO WHICH YOU TOOK ME YOU KNOW ALL NOW SIR BUT I ENTREAT YOU NOT TO JUDGE ME TOO SEVERELY I HAVE BEEN VIRTUOUS ALL THROUGH MY LIFE
HE EXCUSED HIMSELF IN A VERY POLITE MANNER DROWNING HIS REFUSAL IN THAT SEA OF COMMONPLACES WHICH PEOPLE ARE SURE TO REPEAT WHEN THEY CANNOT OR WILL NOT OBLIGE A FRIEND ZAWOISKI CAME IN AS HE WAS STILL APOLOGIZING AND I LEFT THEM TOGETHER
STILL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HER WON AGAIN AND WENT AWAY VERY MUCH IN LOVE I DID NOT FAIL TO PAY HER ANOTHER VISIT THE NEXT MORNING BUT WHEN I PRESENTED MYSELF AT THE HOUSE I WAS TOLD THAT SHE HAD GONE OUT
SITUATED AS SHE WAS I COULD NOT SUPPOSE HER HEART SUSCEPTIBLE OF HARBOURING A NEW AFFECTION AND I WOULD HAVE DESPISED MYSELF IF I HAD TRIED TO SEDUCE HER BY ANY MEANS IN MY POWER I REMAINED WITH HER ONLY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
AT THE HOUSE OF MADAME AVOGADRO A WOMAN FULL OF WIT IN SPITE OF HER SIXTY YEARS
TELL ME HIS NAME ALAS SIR I GIVE WAY TO FATE WITH THESE WORDS SHE TAKES OUT OF HER BOSOM A PAPER WHICH SHE GIVES ME I RECOGNIZE THE HANDWRITING OF ZANETTO STEFFANI
BUT IN VAIN OH WHAT A CRUEL LONG NIGHT IT WAS IN THE MORNING I HEARD THAT THE MONSTER HAD GONE AWAY WITH HIS SERVANT ONE HOUR AFTER SEALING MY SHAME YOU MAY IMAGINE MY DESPAIR I ADOPTED THE ONLY PLAN THAT DESPAIR COULD SUGGEST
BUT HE ALWAYS EXCUSED HIMSELF BY ALLEGING SOME REASON GOOD OR BAD ASSURING ME THAT HE COULD NOT BE HAPPY UNLESS I SHEWED HIM ENTIRE CONFIDENCE HE WOULD BEG OF ME TO MAKE UP MY MIND TO RUN AWAY WITH HIM
IN THE EARLY PART OF OCTOBER SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX THE THEATRES BEING OPENED I WAS WALKING ABOUT WITH MY MASK ON WHEN I PERCEIVED A WOMAN WHOSE HEAD WAS WELL ENVELOPED IN THE HOOD OF HER MANTLE GETTING OUT OF THE FERRARA BARGE WHICH HAD JUST ARRIVED
AND AS I DID NOT RETURN HOME TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT I WENT TO BED WITHOUT SEEING MY FATHER IN THE MORNING I SAID IN HIS PRESENCE THAT I INTENDED TO CALL UPON L'ABBADIE TO CONGRATULATE HIM UPON HIS APPOINTMENT YOU MAY SPARE YOURSELF THAT TROUBLE
I DINED WITH THE THREE FRIENDS AND THE MATTER WAS NOT EVEN ALLUDED TO BUT
I THEN TOOK AN AFFECTIONATE LEAVE OF HER PROMISING TO SEE HER EARLY IN THE MORNING ON LEAVING THIS INTERESTING BUT HAPLESS GIRL I PROCEEDED TO THE HOUSE OF STEFFANI
AND WHEN I TRIED OUT OF MERE GALLANTRY TO KISS HER HAND SHE DREW IT BACK BLUSHING I FEARED SHE MIGHT BE OFFENDED AND I ASSURED HER OF MY RESPECT AH SIR SHE ANSWERED IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH I AM PLACED
THE CONTENTS OF WHICH RAN THUS
EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS TRUE MY BROTHER I HOPE WILL AVENGE ME YOU ARE GREATLY MISTAKEN IF YOU IMAGINE THAT STEFFANI WILL FIGHT YOUR BROTHER STEFFANI IS A COWARD WHO WILL NEVER EXPOSE HIMSELF TO AN HONOURABLE DEATH AS I WAS SPEAKING
VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH MY NEW ACQUAINTANCE I CALLED ALONE ON THE COUNTESS THE NEXT MORNING THE COUNT APOLOGIZING FOR HIS WIFE WHO WAS NOT UP YET TOOK ME TO HER ROOM SHE RECEIVED ME WITH GRACEFUL EASE
IT IS MUCH BETTER STILL TO AVOID THAT FATAL IMPOSSIBILITY BY NEVER PLAYING OTHERWISE THAN WITH MONEY IN HAND NO DOUBT OF IT FOR THEN YOU WILL SAVE BOTH YOUR HONOUR AND YOUR PURSE BUT AS YOU ARE FOND OF GAMES OF CHANCE I ADVISE YOU NEVER TO PUNT
AND LEFT HER WITH SO MUCH AGITATION THAT I HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WEAKNESS OF MY HEROISM WHICH I WAS VERY NEAR TURNING INTO RIDICULE YET I HAD THE WONDERFUL STRENGTH TO PERFORM AT LEAST BY HALVES THE CHARACTER OF A CATO UNTIL THE SEVENTH DAY
SHE EXCUSED HERSELF FOR NOT HAVING COMPLETED HER TOILET AND THE WIDOW WENT ON WITH HER WORK IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN THE WHOLE OF HER FACE HER NECK AND HALF OF HER ARMS WHICH THE GRACES THEMSELVES HAD MOULDED I REMAINED IN SILENT CONTEMPLATION
I HAD NO DOUBT THAT MY EXCELLENT FATHER WOULD GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED SEQUINS DURING THE DAY AND I ENJOYED MY ANTICIPATION THE HONOUR I WOULD DERIVE IN THE OPINION OF THE LOVELY COUNTESS BY MY EXACTITUDE AND PROMPT DISCHARGE OF MY DEBT
I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO DISTURB YOU IN ANY WAY HOW DID YOU USE TO AMUSE YOURSELF AT HOME I AM VERY FOND OF BOOKS AND MUSIC MY HARPSICHORD WAS MY DELIGHT
PROMISING THAT THE NEXT NIGHT HE WOULD BE AGAIN UNDER MY WINDOW READY TO RECEIVE ME IN HIS ARMS COULD I POSSIBLY ENTERTAIN ANY DOUBT AFTER THE FEARFUL CRIME I HAD COMMITTED FOR HIM I PREPARED A SMALL PARCEL AND WAITED FOR HIS COMING
HAVE THROWN ME INTO THE ABYSS I AM IN YOUR HANDS AND I FEEL CERTAIN THAT I SHALL HAVE NO CAUSE TO REPENT IT I NEEDED ALL SHE HAD JUST TOLD ME TO CONFIRM ME IN THE INTEREST WHICH I HAD FELT IN HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENT
NOBLENESS SORROW AND THAT CANDOUR WHICH GIVES YOUTH SUCH AN UNDEFINABLE CHARM I NEED NOT SAY THAT WITH SUCH A GOOD LETTER OF INTRODUCTION THE UNKNOWN AT ONCE CAPTIVATED MY WARMEST INTEREST
AND MORE THAN ALL YOUR CANDOUR THE STAMP OF TRUTH WAS SO WELL AFFIXED TO THE FIRST WORDS YOU UTTERED THAT I COULD NOT HAVE THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT LEFT IN ME AS TO YOUR BEING THE UNHAPPY VICTIM OF THE MOST NATURAL OF ALL FEELINGS AND AS TO YOUR HAVING ABANDONED YOUR HOME THROUGH A SENTIMENT OF HONOUR
AND I SAW THAT IT CONTAINED A PORTRAIT EXACTLY LIKE HER
I PRAISED QUITE BY CHANCE THE PERFUME OF THE POMATUM AND THE WIDOW TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF TELLING HER THAT SHE HAD SPENT IN COMBS POWDER AND POMATUM THE THREE LIVRES SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM HER
I WAS BOUND IN HONOUR TO PAY THE NEXT MORNING AND I DID NOT POSSESS A GROAT LOVE INCREASED MY DESPAIR FOR I SAW MYSELF ON THE POINT OF LOSING THE ESTEEM OF A WOMAN BY WHOM I WAS SMITTEN
BUT YOU HAVE OPENED MY EYES TAKE AWAY I ENTREAT YOU THIS STILETTO WHICH HENCEFORTH IS USELESS TO ME I TRUST IN YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND I HAVE AN INWARD CERTAINTY THAT I SHALL BE INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY HONOUR AS WELL AS FOR MY LIFE
THE BANKER IS CALM THE LAST SAYS I BET YOU DO NOT GUESS WHILE THE FIRST SAYS I BET I CAN GUESS WHICH IS THE FOOL AND WHICH IS THE WISE MAN THE QUESTION IS EASILY ANSWERED
I WAS IN ECSTACY I ENTREATED HER TO SING AFTER SOME LITTLE CEREMONY
I GATHERED FROM HIM ALL THE INFORMATION I REQUIRED AND AMONGST OTHER THINGS I HEARD THAT THE YOUNG COUNTESS HAD A BROTHER THEN AN OFFICER IN THE PAPAL SERVICE VERY EARLY THE NEXT MORNING I CALLED UPON HER SHE WAS STILL ASLEEP THE WIDOW TOLD ME THAT SHE HAD MADE A PRETTY GOOD SUPPER
PERFECTLY AMAZED AND HE BURST OUT LAUGHING I GUESSED THE TRUTH THANKED HIM AND EMBRACING HIM TENDERLY I PROMISED TO BE WISER FOR THE FUTURE THE MIST I HAD BEFORE MY EYES WAS DISPELLED I FELT THAT MY LOVE WAS DEFUNCT
TRY HIM I AM CERTAIN THAT HE WILL BE GLAD TO LEND YOU THAT SUM I DOUBT IT BUT I WILL TRY I CALLED UPON L'ABBADIE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AND AFTER A SHORT EXCHANGE OF COMPLIMENTS I TOLD HIM THE SERVICE I EXPECTED FROM HIS FRIENDSHIP
GUARIENTI AND MY BROTHER LEFT VENICE FOR ROME WHERE JEAN REMAINED IN THE STUDIO OF THE CELEBRATED PAINTER RAPHAEL MENGS WHOM WE SHALL MEET AGAIN HEREAFTER
AFTER WIPING AWAY A FEW TEARS WHICH ARE FLOWING IN SPITE OF ALL HER EFFORTS
OF A YOUNG POLISH NOBLEMAN CALLED ZAWOISKI HE WAS EXPECTING MONEY FROM POLAND BUT IN THE MEAN TIME THE VENETIAN LADIES DID NOT LET HIM WANT FOR ANY BEING ALL VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIS HANDSOME FACE AND HIS POLISH MANNERS
I HEARD FROM ONE OF HIS MOTHER'S GONDOLIERS THAT HE HAD RETURNED TO VENICE THREE DAYS BEFORE BUT THAT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD GONE AWAY AGAIN WITHOUT ANY SERVANT AND NOBODY KNEW HIS WHEREABOUTS NOT EVEN HIS MOTHER THE SAME EVENING
I TAKE OFF MY MASK AND OUT OF POLITENESS SHE MUST PUT DOWN THE HOOD OF HER MANTLE A LARGE MUSLIN HEAD DRESS CONCEALS HALF OF HER FACE BUT HER EYES HER NOSE AND HER PRETTY MOUTH ARE ENOUGH TO LET ME SEE ON HER FEATURES BEAUTY
PRESENTED ME ONE DAY AS WE WERE OUT WALKING TO AN UNKNOWN COUNTESS WHO TOOK MY FANCY VERY STRONGLY WE CALLED ON HER IN THE EVENING AND AFTER INTRODUCING ME TO HER HUSBAND COUNT RINALDI SHE INVITED US TO REMAIN AND HAVE SUPPER
IS TO TAKE ME TO HIS HOUSE TO LEAVE ME THERE AND TO KEEP MY SECRET YOU MAY TRUST MADAM TO THE FEELINGS OF A MAN OF HONOUR I AM WORTHY OF YOUR TRUST HAVE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN ME FOR I ALREADY TAKE A DEEP INTEREST IN ALL YOUR CONCERNS
YOUR FAULT WAS THAT OF A WARM HEART SEDUCED BY LOVE OVER WHICH REASON COULD HAVE NO SWAY AND YOUR FLIGHT THE ACTION OF A SOUL CRYING FOR REPARATION OR FOR REVENGE FULLY JUSTIFIES YOU
AND IT CAME TO A CLOSE FIGHT NOW OTHER PARTS OF THEIR ARMY MADE RESISTANCE FOR A WHILE BUT HEROD RUNNING THE UTMOST HAZARD OUT OF THE RAGE HE WAS IN AT THE MURDER OF HIS BROTHER THAT HE MIGHT BE AVENGED ON THOSE THAT HAD BEEN THE AUTHORS OF IT
TEMPTATIONS WILL COME INFECTIONS WILL COME BUT BE MY HEART THY BEDCHAMBER O MY GOD AND THITHER LET THEM NOT ENTER JOB MADE A COVENANT WITH HIS EYES BUT NOT HIS MAKING OF THAT COVENANT
AND HIS HEART SMOTE HIM WHEN HE HAD NUMBERED HIS PEOPLE
AND THE MALIGNITY OF ILL MEN IS ALSO DIRECTED UPON THE GREATEST AND THE BEST AND NOT ONLY GREATNESS BUT GOODNESS LOSES THE VIGOUR OF BEING AN ANTIDOTE OR CORDIAL AGAINST IT
LEADING ANTIGONUS AWAY IN BONDS TO ANTONY THEN DID THE AXE BRING HIM TO HIS END
NOW THERE WAS BY CHANCE NOBODY ELSE AT HAND THAT MIGHT SEIZE UPON THESE MEN AND FOR HEROD HE WAS CONTENTED TO HAVE COME TO NO HARM HIMSELF SO THAT THEY ALL GOT AWAY IN SAFETY EIGHT
NOW CLEOPATRA HAD PUT TO DEATH ALL HER KINDRED TILL NO ONE NEAR HER IN BLOOD REMAINED ALIVE AND AFTER THAT SHE FELL A SLAYING THOSE NO WAY RELATED TO HER SO SHE CALUMNIATED THE PRINCIPAL MEN AMONG THE SYRIANS TO ANTONY
O HOW LITTLE A THING IS ALL THE GREATNESS OF MAN AND THROUGH HOW FALSE GLASSES DOTH HE MAKE SHIFT TO MULTIPLY IT AND MAGNIFY IT TO HIMSELF AND YET THIS IS ALSO ANOTHER MISERY OF THIS KING OF MAN
TO ASSIST HEROD AND FOLLOWED HIMSELF SOON AFTER WITH THE REST OF HIS ARMY THREE NOW WHEN HEROD WAS AT DAPHNE BY ANTIOCH HE HAD SOME DREAMS WHICH CLEARLY FOREBODED HIS BROTHER'S DEATH
HAST THOU CONSIDERED MY SERVANT JOB THAT THERE IS NONE LIKE HIM UPON THE EARTH
IN WHICH ACTION HEROD'S OWN SIDE WAS WOUNDED WITH A DART FIVE NOW AS ANTIGONUS HAD A MIND TO APPEAR TO EXCEED HEROD NOT ONLY IN THE COURAGE BUT IN THE NUMBER OF HIS MEN HE SENT PAPPUS ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS WITH AN ARMY AGAINST SAMARIA
BY WHICH HE WAS MADE KING AND SOSIUS RELIED UPON ANTONY WHO SENT THE ARMY THAT WAS UNDER HIM TO HEROD'S ASSISTANCE CHAPTER EIGHTEEN HOW HEROD AND SOSIUS TOOK JERUSALEM BY FORCE
BUT AN UNNATURAL HEAT A REBELLIOUS HEAT WILL BLOW UP THE HEART LIKE A MINE IN A MINUTE BUT HOWSOEVER SINCE THE HEART HATH THE BIRTHRIGHT AND PRIMOGENITURE AND THAT IT IS NATURE'S ELDEST SON IN US
NOW WHEN AT THE EVENING HEROD HAD ALREADY DISMISSED HIS FRIENDS TO REFRESH THEMSELVES AFTER THEIR FATIGUE AND WHEN HE WAS GONE HIMSELF WHILE HE WAS STILL HOT IN HIS ARMOR LIKE A COMMON SOLDIER TO BATHE HIMSELF
AND PERSUADED HIM TO HAVE THEM SLAIN THAT SO SHE MIGHT EASILY GAIN TO BE MISTRESS OF WHAT THEY HAD NAY SHE EXTENDED HER AVARICIOUS HUMOR TO THE JEWS AND ARABIANS
AND BY REASON THAT THE JEWS WHO WERE ABOUT HEROD EARNESTLY ENDEAVORED THAT NONE OF THEIR ADVERSARIES MIGHT REMAIN SO THEY WERE CUT TO PIECES BY GREAT MULTITUDES AS THEY WERE CROWDED TOGETHER IN NARROW STREETS AND IN HOUSES OR WERE RUNNING AWAY TO THE TEMPLE
THOUGH IT BE NOT THE STRONGEST PART AS THE ELDEST IS OFTENTIMES NOT THE STRONGEST OF THE FAMILY AND SINCE THE BRAIN AND LIVER AND HEART HOLD NOT A TRIUMVIRATE IN MAN A SOVEREIGNTY EQUALLY SHED UPON THEM ALL
THE HEART WHICH IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO THE KINGS OF THIS WORLD GREAT MEN THAT THE VENOM AND POISON OF EVERY PESTILENTIAL DISEASE DIRECTS ITSELF TO THE HEART AFFECTS THAT PERNICIOUS AFFECTION
FOR THESE COHORTS WERE NEW RAISED MEN GATHERED OUT OF SYRIA AND HERE WAS NO MIXTURE OF THOSE CALLED VETERAN SOLDIERS AMONG THEM WHO MIGHT HAVE SUPPORTED THOSE THAT WERE UNSKILLFUL IN WAR TWO
AS LONG AS I HAVE BUT MY HEART WILT THOU GIVE ME AN INHERITANCE A FILIATION ANY THING FOR MY HEART
ONE IN THE MEAN TIME HEROD'S AFFAIRS IN JUDEA WERE IN AN ILL STATE HE HAD LEFT HIS BROTHER JOSEPH WITH FULL POWER BUT HAD CHARGED HIM TO MAKE NO ATTEMPTS AGAINST ANTIGONUS TILL HIS RETURN
HEREUPON KING HEROD DISTINGUISHED THE MULTITUDE THAT WAS IN THE CITY
AND MARCHED TOWARDS JERICHO WITH FIVE COHORTS WHICH MACHAERUS SENT WITH HIM
AND I HAVE HAD SOME DIFFIDENCE UPON THAT AND THOU HAST CLEARED A MORNING TO ME AGAIN AND MY HEART IS ALIVE DAVID'S HEART SMOTE HIM WHEN HE CUT OFF THE SKIRT FROM SAUL
IF BEFORE HE HAD A BEING HE COULD HAVE SENSE OF THIS MISERY WOULD BUY A BEING HERE UPON THESE CONDITIONS ELEVEN EXPOSTULATION MY GOD MY GOD
OR LET HIM GO FREE BUT PUT HIM INTO BONDS AND KEPT HIM IN CUSTODY THREE BUT HEROD'S CONCERN AT PRESENT NOW HE HAD GOTTEN HIS ENEMIES UNDER HIS POWER
THAT WHEN THOU HAST CATECHISED ME WITH AFFLICTION HERE I MAY TAKE A GREATER DEGREE AND SERVE THEE IN A HIGHER PLACE IN THY KINGDOM OF JOY AND GLORY
AND THUS HE ACCOMPLISHED THIS BY THE BY DURING THE SIEGE OF THE CITY FOR HE HAD HIS ENEMIES IN GREAT CONTEMPT ALREADY NINE WHEN HE HAD THUS MARRIED MARIAMNE HE
HEROD MADE ANSWER THAT HE WOULD GIVE EVERY ONE OF THE SOLDIERS A REWARD OUT OF HIS OWN MONEY SO HE PURCHASED THE DELIVERANCE OF HIS COUNTRY AND PERFORMED HIS PROMISES TO THEM AND MADE PRESENTS AFTER A MAGNIFICENT MANNER TO EACH SOLDIER
HE ALSO FORBADE AT THE SAME TIME THE SPOILING OF THE CITY ASKING SOSIUS IN THE MOST EARNEST MANNER WHETHER THE ROMANS BY THUS EMPTYING THE CITY OF MONEY AND MEN HAD A MIND TO LEAVE HIM KING OF A DESERT
AND THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDINGS SHALL KEEP MY HEART AND MIND THROUGH CHRIST JESUS
AND I CAN GATHER OUT OF THY WORD SO GOOD TESTIMONY OF THE HEARTS OF MEN AS TO FIND SINGLE HEARTS DOCILE AND APPREHENSIVE HEARTS HEARTS THAT CAN HEARTS THAT HAVE LEARNED
WHENCE CAN WE TAKE A BETTER ARGUMENT A CLEARER DEMONSTRATION THAT ALL THE GREATNESS OF THIS WORLD IS BUILT UPON OPINION OF OTHERS AND HATH IN ITSELF NO REAL BEING NOR POWER OF SUBSISTENCE
AS ALL LAWS OF PROPRIETY IN THAT WHICH WE POSSESS ARE OF THE LAW OF NATURE WHICH LAW IS TO GIVE EVERY ONE HIS OWN AND YET IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF NATURE THERE WAS NO PROPRIETY
AND WOULDST THOU HAVE THAT AND SHALL I BE THY SON
HE MADE AN IRRUPTION INTO GALILEE AND MET HIS ENEMIES AND DROVE THEM BACK TO THE PLACE WHICH THEY HAD LEFT
THE LAST ARE NOT HEARTS TO BE GIVEN TO THEE WHAT SHALL I DO WITHOUT THAT PRESENT I CANNOT BE THY SON AND I HAVE IT NOT TO THOSE OF THE FIRST KIND THOU GIVEST JOYFULNESS OF HEART
IT WAS BUT A LITTLE HELP THAT HE HAD TO MAKE OTHER THINGS OF THIS EARTH NOTHING CAN BE NEARER NOTHING THAN THIS EARTH AND YET HOW LITTLE OF THIS EARTH IS THE GREATEST MAN HE THINKS HE TREADS UPON THE EARTH
WHO WAS THE MURDERER OF HIS BROTHER AND SENDS THAT HEAD TO HIS OTHER BROTHER PHERORAS
BECAUSE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MAY SUBSIST THOUGH THERE BE NOT A PRESENT AND A PARTICULAR CARE HAD OF THEM BUT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT THEY CAN SUBSIST IF THE HEART PERISH
AND I HAVE NOT THAT TO THOSE OF THE OTHER KIND THOU GIVEST FAINTNESS OF HEART
BUT THY DWELLING IN HIS HEART ENABLED HIM TO KEEP THAT COVENANT THY SON HIMSELF HAD A SADNESS IN HIS SOUL TO DEATH AND HE HAD A RELUCTATION A DEPRECATION OF DEATH IN THE APPROACHES THEREOF
AND SECRETLY LABORED TO HAVE HEROD AND MALICHUS THE KINGS OF BOTH THOSE NATIONS SLAIN BY HIS ORDER FIVE NOW IS TO THESE HER INJUNCTIONS TO ANTONY HE COMPLIED IN PART
BUT ON THE NEXT DAY HEROD HAD PAPPUS'S HEAD CUT OFF WHO WAS THE GENERAL FOR ANTIGONUS AND WAS SLAIN IN THE BATTLE AND SENT IT TO HIS BROTHER PHERORAS BY WAY OF PUNISHMENT FOR THEIR SLAIN BROTHER FOR HE WAS THE MAN THAT SLEW JOSEPH
NOW IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER THIS THAT ANTONY WAS COME BACK FROM PARTHIA
HE HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING VERY DEAR TO GOD FOR THAT EVENING THERE FEASTED WITH HIM MANY OF THE PRINCIPAL MEN AND AFTER THAT FEAST WAS OVER AND ALL THE GUESTS WERE GONE OUT THE HOUSE FELL DOWN IMMEDIATELY
SO THE GREATEST CORDIAL OF THE HEART PATIENCE IF IT BE MUCH EXERCISED EXALTS THE VENOM AND THE MALIGNITY OF THE ENEMY AND THE MORE WE SUFFER THE MORE WE ARE INSULTED UPON WHEN GOD HAD MADE THIS EARTH OF NOTHING
OR BID IT MEET THEE THIS DAY IN PARADISE I ASK NOT NOT IN A WISH NOT IN A THOUGHT INFIRMITY OF NATURE CURIOSITY OF MIND ARE TEMPTATIONS THAT OFFER
IS BUT A BUSH GROWING UPON THAT TURF OF EARTH HOW LITTLE OF THE WORLD IS THE EARTH AND YET THAT IS ALL THAT MAN HATH OR IS HOW LITTLE OF A MAN IS THE HEART AND YET IT IS ALL BY WHICH HE IS
AND AS HE LEAPED OUT OF HIS BED IN A DISTURBED MANNER THERE CAME MESSENGERS THAT ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THAT CALAMITY SO WHEN HE HAD LAMENTED THIS MISFORTUNE FOR A WHILE HE PUT OFF THE MAIN PART OF HIS MOURNING AND MADE HASTE TO MARCH AGAINST HIS ENEMIES
AND THIS IS THE REWARD OF THE PAINS OF KINGS SOMETIMES THEY NEED THE POWER OF LAW TO BE OBEYED AND WHEN THEY SEEM TO BE OBEYED VOLUNTARILY THEY WHO DO IT DO IT FOR THEIR OWN SAKES
WHEN I COME TO NUMBER MY SINS BUT THAT BLOW IS NOT TO DEATH BECAUSE THOSE SINS ARE NOT TO DEATH BUT MY HEART LIVES IN THEE BUT YET AS LONG AS I REMAIN IN THIS GREAT HOSPITAL
THAT ALL IS UNDER HIS FEET AND THE BRAIN THAT THINKS SO IS BUT EARTH HIS HIGHEST REGION THE FLESH THAT COVERS THAT IS BUT EARTH AND EVEN THE TOP OF THAT
AND THEY HAD LAIN THERE FOR SOME TIME IN GREAT TERROR AND IN PRIVACY AND WHEN THEY SAW THE KING THEY TREMBLED FOR FEAR AND RAN BY HIM IN A FLIGHT ALTHOUGH HE WAS NAKED AND ENDEAVORED TO GET OFF INTO THE PUBLIC ROAD
IT IS A RETURNING HEART AND IF THOU SEE IT UPON THE WAY THOU WILT CARRY IT HOME NAY THE PREPARATION IS THINE TOO THIS MELTING THIS WOUNDING THIS BREAKING
SHALL MY FEAR SHALL MY ZEAL SHALL MY JEALOUSY HAVE LEAVE TO SAY TO THEE HAST THOU CONSIDERED MY HEART THAT THERE IS NOT SO PERVERSE A HEART UPON EARTH
WHICH WERE ELEVEN REGIMENTS OF FOOTMEN AND SIX THOUSAND HORSEMEN BESIDES THE SYRIAN AUXILIARIES WHICH WERE NO SMALL PART OF THE ARMY THEY PITCHED THEIR CAMP NEAR TO THE NORTH WALL HEROD'S DEPENDENCE WAS UPON THE DECREE OF THE SENATE
THAN FROM THE HEART OF MAN IT IS ALWAYS IN ACTION AND MOTION STILL BUSY STILL PRETENDING TO DO ALL TO FURNISH ALL THE POWERS AND FACULTIES WITH ALL THAT THEY HAVE
AND TOLD HIM THAT HE JUDGED THE DOMINION OF THE HABITABLE EARTH TOO SMALL A COMPENSATION FOR THE SLAUGHTER OF SO MANY CITIZENS
AND THESE PARTICULARLY PLUNDERED THE PLACES THAT WERE ABOUT THE CITY AND THIS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FOOD LEFT EITHER FOR THE HORSES OR THE MEN YET SOME OF THE WARLIKE MEN WHO WERE USED TO FIGHT REGULARLY WERE APPOINTED TO DEFEND THE CITY DURING THE SIEGE
THOU HAST SEARCHED SINCE AND FOUND ALL THESE GRADATIONS IN THE ILL OF OUR HEARTS THAT EVERY IMAGINATION OF THE THOUGHTS OF OUR HEARTS IS ONLY EVIL CONTINUALLY
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE DEATH OF JOSEPH HEROD'S BROTHER WHICH HAD BEEN SIGNIFIED TO HEROD IN DREAMS HOW HEROD WAS PRESERVED TWICE AFTER A WONDERFUL MANNER HE CUTS OFF THE HEAD OF PAPPUS
THOUGH THOU FILLEST ALL YET ART OTHERWISE IN SOME ROOMS THEREOF THAN IN OTHERS OTHERWISE IN THY CHURCH THAN IN MY CHAMBER AND OTHERWISE IN THY SACRAMENTS THAN IN MY PRAYERS
BUT THROUGH THEIR MINES UNDER GROUND THEY WOULD APPEAR IN THE MIDST OF THEM ON THE SUDDEN AND BEFORE THEY COULD BATTER DOWN ONE WALL THEY BUILT THEM ANOTHER IN ITS STEAD AND TO SUM UP ALL AT ONCE
BUT HE HAD HIS CORDIAL TOO YET NOT MY WILL BUT THINE BE DONE AND AS THOU HAST NOT DELIVERED US THINE ADOPTED SONS FROM THESE INFECTIOUS TEMPTATIONS
THE PART WHICH IS FIRST BORN TO LIFE IN MAN AND THAT THE OTHER PARTS AS YOUNGER BRETHREN AND SERVANTS IN HIS FAMILY HAVE A DEPENDANCE UPON IT IT IS REASON THAT THE PRINCIPAL CARE BE HAD OF IT
HE WAS ALSO TOO HARD FOR THE JEWS BY THE ROMANS SKILL IN THE ART OF WAR ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BOLD TO THE UTMOST DEGREE NOW THEY DURST NOT COME TO A PLAIN BATTLE WITH THE ROMANS WHICH WAS CERTAIN DEATH
NOBODY COULD BE PERSUADED TO WITHHOLD THEIR RIGHT HAND FROM SLAUGHTER BUT THEY SLEW PEOPLE OF ALL AGES LIKE MADMEN THEN IT WAS THAT ANTIGONUS WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO HIS FORMER OR TO HIS PRESENT FORTUNE CAME DOWN FROM THE CITADEL
PARTLY BY HIS THREATENINGS NAY PARTLY BY FORCE AS THINKING THE VICTORY WORSE THAN A DEFEAT TO HIM IF ANY THING THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE SEEN WERE SEEN BY THEM
ACQUAINTANCE AT THE WORKS BUT HE WENT HIMSELF TO SAMARIA TO TAKE THE DAUGHTER OF ALEXANDER THE SON OF ARISTOBULUS TO WIFE WHO HAD BEEN BETROTHED TO HIM BEFORE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID
HE ALSO PRESSED HARD UPON THE HINDERMOST AND SLEW A VAST NUMBER OF THEM HE ALSO FELL INTO THE VILLAGE WITH THE ENEMY WHERE EVERY HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH ARMED MEN AND THE UPPER ROOMS WERE CROWDED ABOVE WITH SOLDIERS FOR THEIR DEFENSE
THAN IN THE OTHER OFFICES INTO THE HOUSE OF THINE ANOINTED DISLOYAL PERSONS TRAITORS WILL COME INTO THY HOUSE THE CHURCH HYPOCRITES AND IDOLATORS WILL COME INTO SOME ROOMS OF THIS THY HOUSE MY BODY
UPON THE CONFIDENCE OF WHICH VICTORY HEROD HAD MARCHED IMMEDIATELY TO JERUSALEM
BUT A SILENT AND ABSOLUTE OBEDIENCE TO THY WILL EVEN BEFORE I KNOW IT IS MY CORDIAL PRESERVE THAT TO ME O MY GOD AND THAT WILL PRESERVE ME TO THEE
AND AS THE NOBLEST AND MOST GENEROUS CORDIALS THAT NATURE OR ART AFFORD OR CAN PREPARE IF THEY BE OFTEN TAKEN AND MADE FAMILIAR BECOME NO CORDIALS NOR HAVE ANY EXTRAORDINARY OPERATION
WHO STILL HAD A FOND DESIRE OF LIFE AND SOME FRIGID HOPES OF IT TO THE LAST BUT BY HIS COWARDLY BEHAVIOR WELL DESERVED TO DIE BY IT FOUR
AND HAD CONDUCTED ANTONY IN HIS EXPEDITION AGAINST THE PARTHIANS AS FAR AS EUPHRATES SHE CAME BY APAMIA AND DAMASCUS INTO JUDEA AND THERE DID HEROD PACIFY HER INDIGNATION AT HIM BY LARGE PRESENTS
AND THERE IT WAS THAT POMPEY TOOK THE CITY SO HE PARTED THE WORK AMONG THE ARMY AND DEMOLISHED THE SUBURBS
THIS SICK THIS DISEASEFUL WORLD AS LONG AS I REMAIN IN THIS LEPROUS HOUSE THIS FLESH OF MINE THIS HEART THOUGH THUS PREPARED FOR THEE PREPARED BY THEE
WISE HEARTS IN ONE PLACE AND IN ANOTHER IN A GREAT DEGREE WISE PERFECT HEARTS STRAIGHT HEARTS NO PERVERSENESS WITHOUT AND CLEAN HEARTS NO FOULNESS WITHIN
YET THOU SOUGHTEST AND FOUNDEST A MAN AFTER THINE OWN HEART
NO MEUM ET TUUM BUT AN UNIVERSAL COMMUNITY OVERALL
SO THOUGH THOU BE ALWAYS PRESENT AND ALWAYS WORKING IN EVERY ROOM OF THIS THY HOUSE MY BODY YET I HUMBLY BESEECH THEE TO MANIFEST ALWAYS A MORE EFFECTUAL PRESENCE IN MY HEART
AND PROPORTIONABLY TO THEIR COMMANDERS AND WITH A MOST ROYAL BOUNTY TO SOSIUS HIMSELF WHEREBY NOBODY WENT AWAY BUT IN A WEALTHY CONDITION HEREUPON SOSIUS DEDICATED A CROWN OF GOLD TO GOD AND THEN WENT AWAY FROM JERUSALEM
THAT SERVE AND OBEY THEM THAT ARE WEAKER NEITHER DOTH THIS OBLIGATION FALL UPON US BY SECOND DICTATES OF NATURE BY CONSEQUENCES AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING OUT OF NATURE OR DERIVED FROM NATURE BY DISCOURSE
AND WHEN HE HAD BEATEN THOSE THAT WERE ON THE OUTSIDE HE PULLED THE HOUSES TO PIECES AND PLUCKED OUT THOSE THAT WERE WITHIN UPON MANY HE HAD THE ROOFS SHAKEN DOWN WHEREBY THEY PERISHED BY HEAPS AND AS FOR THOSE THAT FLED OUT OF THE RUINS
SO NEITHER HAST THOU DELIVERED US OVER TO THEM NOR WITHHELD THY CORDIALS FROM US I WAS BAPTIZED IN THY CORDIAL WATER AGAINST ORIGINAL SIN AND I HAVE DRUNK OF THY CORDIAL BLOOD
YET WAS HE FORCED BY A MOST TERRIBLE STORM TO PITCH HIS CAMP IN THE NEIGHBORING VILLAGES BEFORE HE COULD TAKE IT BUT WHEN AFTER A FEW DAYS TIME THE SECOND LEGION THAT CAME FROM ANTONY JOINED THEMSELVES TO HIM
AND THERE DROWNED THEM THERE WAS A GREAT CHANGE MADE ALSO IN IDUMEA WHERE MACHAERUS WAS BUILDING A WALL ABOUT ONE OF THE FORTRESSES WHICH WAS CALLED GITTHA BUT HEROD HAD NOT YET BEEN INFORMED OF THESE THINGS
NOW AS FOR THE ROBBERIES WHICH WERE COMMITTED THE KING CONTRIVED THAT AMBUSHES SHOULD BE SO LAID THAT THEY MIGHT RESTRAIN THEIR EXCURSIONS AND AS FOR THE WANT OF PROVISIONS HE PROVIDED THAT THEY SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THEM FROM GREAT DISTANCES
ONE OF THE ENEMIES MET HIM IN THE FACE WITH A SWORD IN HIS HAND AND THEN A SECOND AND THEN A THIRD AND AFTER THAT MORE OF THEM THESE WERE MEN WHO HAD RUN AWAY OUT OF THE BATTLE INTO THE BATH IN THEIR ARMOR
BEING THE WEAKER PART OF THEM GAVE IT OUT THAT AS THE TIMES WERE HE WAS THE HAPPIEST AND MOST RELIGIOUS MAN WHO SHOULD DIE FIRST BUT AS TO THE MORE BOLD AND HARDY MEN THEY GOT TOGETHER IN BODIES AND FELL A ROBBING OTHERS AFTER VARIOUS MANNERS
THAT THE CONQUERORS COULD NOT PASS ALONG THE ROADS NOW THE ENEMY COULD NOT BEAR THIS BLOW SO THAT WHEN THE MULTITUDE OF THEM WHICH WAS GATHERED TOGETHER SAW THAT THOSE IN THE VILLAGE WERE SLAIN THEY DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND FLED AWAY
THIS CONTRITION WHICH I HAVE NOW IS THY WAY TO THY END AND THOSE DISCOMFORTS ARE FOR ALL THAT THE EARNEST OF THY SPIRIT IN MY HEART
MY GOD MY GOD WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME THOU DIDST REACH OUT THY HAND TO HIM BUT NOT TO DELIVER HIS SAD SOUL BUT TO RECEIVE HIS HOLY SOUL
NOW A GREAT MULTITUDE OF JEWS RESORTED TO HIM EVERY DAY BOTH OUT OF JERICHO AND THE OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SOME WERE MOVED SO TO DO OUT OF THEIR HATRED TO ANTIGONUS AND SOME OUT OF REGARD TO THE GLORIOUS ACTIONS HEROD HAD DONE
FOR MY RECOVERY FROM ACTUAL AND HABITUAL SIN IN THE OTHER SACRAMENT THOU O LORD WHO HAST IMPRINTED ALL MEDICINAL VIRTUES WHICH ARE IN ALL CREATURES AND HAST MADE EVEN THE FLESH OF VIPERS TO ASSIST IN CORDIALS
WILL STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE INVASION OF MALIGN AND PESTILENT VAPOURS BUT I HAVE MY CORDIALS IN THY PROMISE WHEN I SHALL KNOW THE PLAGUE OF MY HEART AND PRAY UNTO THEE IN THY HOUSE
BUT HEROD OVERRAN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY AND DEMOLISHED FIVE LITTLE CITIES AND DESTROYED TWO THOUSAND MEN THAT WERE IN THEM AND BURNED THEIR HOUSES AND THEN RETURNED TO HIS CAMP BUT HIS HEAD QUARTERS WERE AT THE VILLAGE CALLED CANA SIX
ALL THAT THOU ASKEST OF ME IS MY HEART MY SON GIVE ME THY HEART
AND NOW THEY FIRST OF ALL SEIZED UPON WHAT WAS ABOUT THE TEMPLE AND UPON THE POURING IN OF THE ARMY THERE WAS SLAUGHTER OF VAST MULTITUDES EVERY WHERE BY REASON OF THE RAGE THE ROMANS WERE IN AT THE LENGTH OF THIS SIEGE
WHICH IS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO HAVE CARE OF OUR OWN PRESERVATION TO LOOK FIRST TO OURSELVES FOR THEREFORE DOTH THE PHYSICIAN INTERMIT THE PRESENT CARE OF BRAIN OR LIVER
MUST CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AS CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS AS ALL PERSONS TO ALL KINDS OF SUPERIORS THOUGH OFTENTIMES THOSE PARENTS OR THOSE SUPERIORS
NEITHER DID HE LONGER DESIRE TO HOLD IT OF THEE BUT TO RECOMMEND IT TO THEE I SEE THINE HAND UPON ME NOW O LORD AND I ASK NOT WHY IT COMES WHAT IT INTENDS
AND WOULDST THOU HAVE MY HEART O GOD OF ALL LIGHT I KNOW THOU KNOWEST ALL AND IT IS THOU
SOSIUS ALSO JOINED HIM WITH A LARGE ARMY BOTH OF HORSEMEN AND FOOTMEN WHICH HE SENT BEFORE HIM THROUGH THE MIDLAND PARTS WHILE HE MARCHED HIMSELF ALONG PHOENICIA AND WHEN THE WHOLE ARMY WAS GOTTEN TOGETHER
SOON BEAT THOSE THAT OPPOSED HIM AND AFTER HE HAD BEATEN THEM HE ALWAYS TURNED HIS FORCE AGAINST THOSE THAT STOOD TO IT STILL AND PURSUED THEM ALL SO THAT A GREAT SLAUGHTER WAS MADE WHILE SOME WERE FORCED BACK INTO THAT VILLAGE WHENCE THEY CAME OUT
AND BEGAN TO FIGHT WITH THOSE IN HIS FOREFRONT YET DURST THEY NOT BE SO VERY BOLD AS TO ENGAGE THE ROMANS HAND TO HAND BUT THREW STONES AND DARTS AT THEM AT A DISTANCE BY WHICH MEANS THEY WOUNDED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER
FOR GIVING THAT THE HEART IS DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS AND DESPERATELY WICKED WHO CAN KNOW IT
WITHOUT THEE O SOVEREIGN GOODNESS I COULD NOT KNOW HOW ILL MY HEART WERE THOU HAST DECLARED UNTO ME IN THY WORD THAT FOR ALL THIS DELUGE OF EVIL THAT HATH SURROUNDED ALL HEARTS
THEY BORE A SIEGE OF FIVE MONTHS TILL SOME OF HEROD'S CHOSEN MEN VENTURED TO GET UPON THE WALL AND FELL INTO THE CITY AS DID SOSIUS'S CENTURIONS AFTER THEM
BUT IF AN ENEMY DARE RISE UP AGAINST IT IT IS THE SOONEST ENDANGERED THE SOONEST DEFEATED OF ANY PART THE BRAIN WILL HOLD OUT LONGER THAN IT AND THE LIVER LONGER THAN THAT THEY WILL ENDURE A SIEGE
A HEAVINESS AND DEJECTION OF SPIRIT UPON HIM I HAVE FOUND THESE HEARTS AND A WORSE THAN THESE
ART ABLE TO MAKE THIS PRESENT SICKNESS EVERLASTING HEALTH THIS WEAKNESS EVERLASTING STRENGTH AND THIS VERY DEJECTION AND FAINTNESS OF HEART A POWERFUL CORDIAL
WAS TO RESTRAIN THE ZEAL OF HIS FOREIGN AUXILIARIES FOR THE MULTITUDE OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE WERE VERY EAGER TO SEE THE TEMPLE AND WHAT WAS SACRED IN THE HOLY HOUSE ITSELF BUT THE KING ENDEAVORED TO RESTRAIN THEM PARTLY BY HIS EXHORTATIONS
IF YOU RETURN TO THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEARTS PREPARE YOUR HEARTS UNTO THE LORD
FOR THAT MACHAERUS WOULD NOT BE SUCH AN ASSISTANT AS HE COULD DEPEND ON AS IT APPEARED BY WHAT HE HAD DONE ALREADY
BUT OTHERS WERE LED ON BY AN UNREASONABLE DESIRE OF CHANGE SO HE FELL UPON THEM IMMEDIATELY AS FOR PAPPUS AND HIS PARTY THEY WERE NOT TERRIFIED EITHER AT THEIR NUMBER OR AT THEIR ZEAL BUT MARCHED OUT WITH GREAT ALACRITY TO FIGHT THEM
MINISTRANT ARS ET NATURA INSTILLANT THEY USE CORDIALS TO KEEP THE VENOM AND MALIGNITY OF THE DISEASE FROM THE HEART ELEVEN MEDITATION
WITH THE SLEEPY RESIGNATION OF A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THAT EMPLOYMENT FOR SOME HOURS PAST THE SUN WAS SHINING AND THE GREEN SHUTTERS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WERE CLOSED THE DIM LIGHT FELL TENDERLY ON THE TWO QUIET SEATED FIGURES
WAS AMONG THE PECULIARITIES OF HER CHARACTER WHICH WERE NOTORIOUS TO EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE IT WAS ONE OF HER FATHER'S FAVORITE JOKES THAT SHE REMINDED HIM ON SUCH OCCASIONS OF A CAT HAVING HER BACK STROKED
ALLOWED IT TO SPREAD THROUGH ITS PORES
I KNEW YOU DIRECTLY SIR REPLIED THE YOUNG MINER CAP IN HAND YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED YOU LOOK JUST AS YOU DID WHEN YOU BADE US GOOD BY IN THE DOCHART PIT I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THAT DAY PUT ON YOUR CAP HARRY SAID THE ENGINEER
ALWAYS EXCEPTING THE TWO UNMANAGEABLE CHARACTERS OF LUCY THE WAITING MAID AND FALKLAND JULIA'S JEALOUS LOVER GENTLEMEN CAME SAW JULIA AT REHEARSAL OBSERVED HER STOUTNESS AND HER WIG
MISTER MARRABLE SECURED THE SERVICES OF A RESPECTABLE PROFESSIONAL PERSON TO DRILL THE YOUNG LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND TO ACCEPT ALL THE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES INCIDENTAL TO CREATING A DRAMATIC WORLD OUT OF A DOMESTIC CHAOS
ACCORDINGLY WHEN FRANK PRESENTED HIMSELF AT COMBE RAVEN ON THE EVENTFUL MORNING THERE STOOD MISS GARTH PREPARED IN THE INTERPOLATED CHARACTER OF ARGUS TO ACCOMPANY LUCY AND FALKLAND TO THE SCENE OF TRIAL
RETIRED TO THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM AND SPOKE TOGETHER IN WHISPERS IT GREW LATER AND LATER AND STILL MAGDALEN NEVER FLINCHED FROM HER TASK STILL WITH EQUAL PERSEVERANCE NORAH WHO HAD BEEN ON THE WATCH ALL THROUGH THE EVENING
ENGINEER TO GO TO THE YARROW SHAFT WAS IT REALLY TRUE THAT THE FIRST COMMUNICATION WAS NOW WITHOUT OBJECT DID SOMEONE WISH TO PREVENT JAMES STARR FROM TROUBLING HIMSELF EITHER USELESSLY OR OTHERWISE
HAVING FURTHER ACCUSTOMED THEMSELVES TO THE BREAKING OF FURNITURE AND THE STAINING OF WALLS TO THUMPING TUMBLING HAMMERING AND SCREAMING TO DOORS ALWAYS BANGING AND TO FOOTSTEPS PERPETUALLY RUNNING UP AND DOWN STAIRS
RATHER THAN TO THE WARNING OF HIS ANONYMOUS CONTRADICTOR INDEED SAID HE
ARE YOU HARRY FORD ASKED THE ENGINEER QUICKLY YES MISTER STARR
SO SERENELY SELF DEMONSTRATIVE SO DROWSILY DEEP THAT IT DID IRRESISTIBLY SUGGEST A PET CAT'S ENJOYMENT UNDER A CARESSING HAND
DON'T TELL MY FATHER ABOUT THIS ACTING PLEASE I SHOULD NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT THOSE WERE THE ONLY WORDS HE HAD SPIRIT ENOUGH TO UTTER HE DRIFTED AWAY AIMLESSLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SHRUBBERY
NO IT WAS I THEN DID SIMON FORD SEND ME A SECOND LETTER TO CONTRADICT THE FIRST ASKED THE ENGINEER QUICKLY
THE FEW ATTEMPTS HE MADE TO VARY THE STERNLY PRACTICAL NATURE OF THE EVENING'S OCCUPATION BY SLIPPING IN COMPLIMENTS SIDELONG
BETWEEN THESE TWO BEDS ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF PRESSURE TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED ARE FOUND VEINS OF GRAPHITE AND RICH OR POOR COAL IT MAY BE ASSERTED THAT IT IS FOR WANT OF SUFFICIENT PRESSURE
WHEN FRANK PRESENTED HIMSELF IN THE EVENING IGNORANT OF THE FIRST ELEMENTS OF HIS PART SHE TOOK HIM IN HAND AS A MIDDLE AGED SCHOOLMISTRESS MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IN HAND A BACKWARD LITTLE BOY
AND IT MAY BE SAID THAT THEY WERE DESTINED TO STORE IT IN THE FORM OF COAL IN THE VERY BOWELS OF THE EARTH IT WAS THE EARTHQUAKE PERIOD CAUSED BY INTERNAL CONVULSIONS WHICH SUDDENLY MODIFIED THE UNSETTLED FEATURES OF THE TERRESTRIAL SURFACE
INTIMATELY AS MISS GARTH WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THIS PECULIARITY IN HER PUPIL SHE NOW SAW IT ASSERTING ITSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ASSOCIATION WITH MENTAL EXERTION OF ANY KIND ON MAGDALEN'S PART
THE SOIL OF THE CONTINENTS WAS COVERED WITH IMMENSE FORESTS CARBONIC ACID SO SUITABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM ABOUNDED THE FEET OF THESE TREES WERE DROWNED IN A SORT OF IMMENSE LAGOON
OMITTED TO NOTICE THAT HER HEART WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE QUAILED AT THE PROSPECT APOLOGIZED AND RETIRED LADIES READ THE PART OF LUCY REMARKED THAT SHE APPEARED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE PLAY
IF AFTER ALL IT WAS A HOAX IT WAS WELL WORTH WHILE TO PROVE IT STARR ALSO THOUGHT IT WISER TO GIVE MORE CREDENCE TO THE FIRST LETTER THAN TO THE SECOND THAT IS TO SAY TO THE REQUEST OF SUCH A MAN AS SIMON FORD
SO THEN THE ORIGIN OF COAL MINES IN WHATEVER PART OF THE GLOBE THEY HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IS THIS
AND THE QUIETER THE HOUSE IS THE MORE OBLIGED I SHALL FEEL TO EVERYBODY BEFORE MISS GARTH'S BATTERY OF REPROOF COULD OPEN FIRE BEFORE THE FIRST OUTBURST OF MISTER VANSTONE'S HEARTY LAUGHTER COULD ESCAPE HIS LIPS
AND EVERYWHERE FROM THE GARRET TO THE KITCHEN THE HOUSE SEEMED HARDLY LIKE ITSELF WITH THE ONE EVER DISTURBING ELEMENT IN THE FAMILY SERENITY SUDDENLY WITHDRAWN FROM IT
THE SECOND LETTER HAD FOR AN INSTANT CHECKED HIS SPECULATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT BUT NOW HE THOUGHT OF THAT LETTER NO LONGER BESIDES THE SON OF THE OLD OVERMAN WAS THERE WAITING AT THE APPOINTED RENDEZVOUS THE ANONYMOUS LETTER WAS THEREFORE WORTH NOTHING
THE COOL FRAGRANCE OF FLOWERS AND PERFUMES IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE RAPT ATTITUDE OF MAGDALEN ABSORBED OVER HER READING THE MONOTONOUS REGULARITY OF MOVEMENT IN THE MAID'S HAND AND ARM AS SHE DREW THE COMB SMOOTHLY
OF WHICH THE ENGINEER JAMES STARR HAD SO LONG DIRECTED THE WORKS FOR TEN YEARS THESE MINES HAD BEEN ABANDONED
WHO AFFECT TO IGNORE THE ALL IMPORTANT INFLUENCE WHICH FEMALE FEEDING EXERTS IN THE PRODUCTION OF FEMALE BEAUTY ON THIS OCCASION SHE REFUSED ONE DISH AFTER ANOTHER WITH A RESOLUTION WHICH IMPLIED THE RAREST OF ALL MODERN MARTYRDOMS
HIS WHOLE THOUGHT WAS TO REACH CALLANDER WHERE HARRY FORD WAS SUPPOSEDLY AWAITING HIM THE BETTER TO UNDERSTAND THIS NARRATIVE IT WILL BE AS WELL TO HEAR A FEW WORDS ON THE ORIGIN OF COAL DURING THE GEOLOGICAL EPOCH
IT MAY BE A MISTAKE SAID NORAH TAKING HER FATHER'S PART AS USUAL BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW PAPA OR ANY ONE ELSE COULD HAVE DECLINED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
AND TO THE DOUBTFUL PROSPECT THAT AWAITED HER IN THE COMING SUMMER IN A TONE OF DESPONDENCY WHICH IT WAS VERY DISTRESSING TO HEAR ANXIOUS TO CHEER HER SPIRITS MISS GARTH HAD CHANGED THE CONVERSATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
BECAME HYSTERICAL UNDER THE STRAIN OF PERPETUAL ANXIETY THE FAMILY DOCTOR DECLINED TO ANSWER FOR THE NERVOUS CONSEQUENCES IF SOMETHING WAS NOT DONE RENEWED EFFORTS WERE MADE IN EVERY DIRECTION
IT IS ANOTHER THING ALTOGETHER TO FIND THE ACTORS HITHERTO ONLY THE SMALL PRELIMINARY ANNOYANCES PROPER TO THE OCCASION HAD SHOWN THEMSELVES AT EVERGREEN LODGE THE SOUND AND SERIOUS TROUBLES WERE ALL TO COME
HAD SPOKEN SELF REPROACHFULLY OF HER WEAKNESS IN ADMITTING CAPTAIN WRAGGE'S IMPUDENT CLAIM TO A FAMILY CONNECTION WITH HER AND HAD THEN REVERTED TO THE STATE OF HER HEALTH
I COULDN'T SAY I HAD METHODISTICAL OBJECTIONS I'VE NOTHING METHODISTICAL ABOUT ME WHAT OTHER EXCUSE COULD I MAKE THE MARRABLES ARE RESPECTABLE PEOPLE AND KEEP THE BEST COMPANY IN CLIFTON
THE SANCTUARY OF UNRUFFLED REPOSE MISS GARTH PAUSED ON THE THRESHOLD AND LOOKED INTO THE ROOM IN SILENCE MAGDALEN'S CURIOUS FANCY FOR HAVING HER HAIR COMBED AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS
AND COMFORTABLY ARRAYED IN HER MORNING WRAPPER UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO DRESS FOR DINNER AND THERE BEHIND HER SAT THE LADY'S MAID SLOWLY COMBING OUT THE LONG HEAVY LOCKS OF HER YOUNG MISTRESS'S HAIR
THIS IS A FAR MORE SERIOUS MATTER THAN ANY OF YOU SUPPOSE
PECULIAR FORM OF VEGETATION SUCH AS IS PROBABLY PRODUCED ON THE SURFACE OF THE INFERIOR PLANETS VENUS OR MERCURY WHICH REVOLVE NEARER THAN OUR EARTH AROUND THE RADIANT SUN OF OUR SYSTEM
WHICH LOOPED UP ITS CURTAINS AND THE BRIGHT DRESS FOR DINNER LAID READY ACROSS IT ON THE GAYLY PAINTED BATH WITH ITS PURE LINING OF WHITE ENAMEL ON THE TOILET TABLE WITH ITS SPARKLING TRINKETS ITS CRYSTAL BOTTLES
FRANK'S HELPLESS ASTONISHMENT AT HER DISAPPEARANCE ADDED A NEW ELEMENT OF ABSURDITY TO THE SCENE HE STOOD FIRST ON ONE LEG AND THEN ON THE OTHER
IN THE MINE WHAT IN THE DOCHART PIT YES MISTER STARR REPLIED HARRY REALLY HAS YOUR FAMILY NEVER LEFT THE OLD MINE SINCE THE CESSATION OF THE WORKS
THUS IN THE LOWEST LAYERS OF THE COAL GROUND APPEARS THE ANTHRACITE WHICH BEING ALMOST DESTITUTE OF VOLATILE MATTER CONTAINS THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF CARBON
NOT A DAY MISTER STARR YOU KNOW MY FATHER
KEPT CONTINUALLY FULL BY CURRENTS OF FRESH AND SALT WATERS THEY EAGERLY ASSIMILATED TO THEMSELVES THE CARBON WHICH THEY LITTLE BY LITTLE EXTRACTED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AS YET UNFIT FOR THE FUNCTION OF LIFE
KEPT ON THE WATCH TO THE END THE DISTRUST DARKENED AND DARKENED ON HER FACE AS SHE LOOKED AT HER SISTER AND FRANK
THE GIRL'S FERVID TEMPERAMENT INTENSIFIED THE ESSENTIALLY FEMININE PLEASURE THAT MOST WOMEN FEEL IN THE PASSAGE OF THE COMB THROUGH THEIR HAIR TO A LUXURY OF SENSATION WHICH ABSORBED HER IN ENJOYMENT
SURELY MY SILENCE WAS A SUFFICIENT WARNING TO YOU TO SAY NO A MISTAKE MISTER VANSTONE CHIMED IN MISS GARTH MADE WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS BUT A MISTAKE FOR ALL THAT
THROUGH AND THROUGH HER MISTRESS'S HAIR ALL CONVEYED THE SAME SOOTHING IMPRESSION OF DROWSY DELICIOUS QUIET ON ONE SIDE OF THE DOOR WERE THE BROAD DAYLIGHT AND THE FAMILIAR REALITIES OF LIFE
SHE SMILED WHEN SHE WAS OUTSIDE ON THE LANDING THE FEMALE MIND DOES OCCASIONALLY THOUGH NOT OFTEN PROJECT ITSELF INTO THE FUTURE MISS GARTH WAS PROPHETICALLY PITYING MAGDALEN'S UNFORTUNATE HUSBAND
AND ANOTHER LAID VIOLENT HANDS ON SIR LUCIUS O'TRIGGER THESE TWO WERE FOLLOWED BY AN ACCOMMODATING SPINSTER RELATIVE WHO ACCEPTED THE HEAVY DRAMATIC RESPONSIBILITY OF MISSUS MALAPROP
THE RAILWAY CONVEYED THE THREE IN EXCELLENT TIME TO EVERGREEN LODGE
SHE HAD DECIDED ON CELEBRATING IT BY ACTING A PLAY HAD ISSUED HER ORDERS ACCORDINGLY AND HAD BEEN OBEYED BY HER DOCILE PARENTS AS IMPLICITLY AS USUAL MISSUS MARRABLE GAVE UP THE DRAWING ROOM TO BE LAID WASTE FOR A STAGE AND A THEATER
A LADY WHOSE AGE WAS UNKNOWN AND WHOSE PERSONAL APPEARANCE WAS STOUT BUT WHOSE HEART WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE VOLUNTEERED TO ACT THE PART OF THE SENTIMENTAL JULIA
AND TO THE UNIVERSE FOR A FALKLAND WITH THE MENDICANT PERTINACITY OF A FAMILY IN DESPAIR THIS STATEMENT OF CIRCUMSTANCES
THIS QUESTION JAMES STARR COULD NOT CEASE ASKING HIMSELF WAS HE CALLED TO MAKE CONQUEST OF ANOTHER CORNER OF THESE RICH TREASURE FIELDS FAIN WOULD HE HOPE IT WAS SO
VERY WELL SAID STARR WITHOUT SPEAKING OF THE ANONYMOUS LETTER THEN CONTINUING
AFTER TEA MY VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT OF FALKLAND WILL BE AT YOUR DISPOSAL THOMAS WHATEVER ELSE THE GARDENER DOES HE IS NOT TO MAKE ANY FLORICULTURAL NOISES UNDER MY WINDOW
THUS ALSO SHELLS ZOOPHYTES STAR FISH POLYPI SPIRIFORES EVEN FISH AND LIZARDS BROUGHT BY THE WATER
SHE VENTURED ON PUTTING THE QUESTION FIRST TO THE MISTRESS AND RECEIVING NO ANSWER IN THAT QUARTER SECONDLY TO THE MAID ALL THE AFTERNOON MISS OFF AND ON WAS THE WEARY ANSWER
WHAT HARM CAN SHE GET IN THEIR HOUSE IF YOU COME TO PRUDENCE AND THAT SORT OF THING WHY SHOULDN'T MAGDALEN DO WHAT MISS MARRABLE DOES THERE THERE LET THE POOR THINGS ACT AND AMUSE THEMSELVES
WITH A PERFECT EXPLOSION OF THANKS FATHER MOTHER AND DAUGHTER SOWING THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE BROADCAST FROM THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR TO THE GARDEN GATES AS SOON AS THE CARRIAGE HAD DRIVEN AWAY
CHARACTERS AND THEN BROKE DOWN IN THE EFFORT TO STUDY THEM OR THEY VOLUNTEERED TO TAKE THE PARTS WHICH THEY KNEW WERE ALREADY ENGAGED AND DECLINED THE PARTS WHICH WERE WAITING TO BE ACTED
THE RIVALS HAVING BEEN CHOSEN AS THE PLAY MISS MARRABLE AS A MATTER OF COURSE APPROPRIATED TO HERSELF THE PART OF LYDIA LANGUISH
IN THE HIGHER BEDS ARE FOUND ON THE CONTRARY LIGNITE AND FOSSIL WOOD SUBSTANCES IN WHICH THE QUANTITY OF CARBON IS INFINITELY LESS
THE NOMINAL MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE FONDLY BELIEVED THAT THEIR CHIEF TROUBLES WERE OVER INNOCENT AND FATAL DELUSION IT IS ONE THING IN PRIVATE SOCIETY TO SET UP THE STAGE AND CHOOSE THE PLAY
AND READ OVER YOUR PART AND DON'T LET YOUR ATTENTION WANDER IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY HELP IT I SHALL NOT BE ACCESSIBLE BEFORE THE EVENING IF YOU WILL COME HERE WITH PAPA'S PERMISSION
ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDINGS HAD BEEN CARRIED TO A DEPTH OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR EVEN OF TWO THOUSAND FEET AND WHEN JAMES STARR HAD RETIRED IT WAS WITH THE FULL CONVICTION THAT EVEN THE SMALLEST VEIN HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED
TO GO TO GRANTON PIER TO CATCH THE STEAMER WHICH IN THREE HOURS WOULD TAKE HIM UP THE FORTH AS FAR AS STIRLING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE PERHAPS IN PASSING ALONG THE CANONGATE
HE WENT TO BED MORE EXCITED THAN THE AFFAIR PERHAPS WARRANTED THE NEXT DAY AT FIVE O'CLOCK JAMES STARR JUMPED OUT OF BED DRESSED HIMSELF WARMLY
MISS MARRABLE WAS THAT HARDEST OF ALL BORN TYRANTS AN ONLY CHILD SHE HAD NEVER GRANTED A CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE TO HER OPPRESSED FATHER AND MOTHER SINCE THE TIME WHEN SHE CUT HER FIRST TOOTH HER SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY WAS NOW NEAR AT HAND
AND THE HIGH TEMPERATURE MAINTAINED BY THE INTERNAL FIRES AT THIS TIME SO CLOSE TO IT THUS THERE WAS ONE KINGDOM SUBSTITUTED FOR ANOTHER IN THIS SLOW BUT IRRESISTIBLE REACTION THE VEGETABLE WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A MINERAL
AS FAST AS SHE TEACHES ME ONE SPEECH
OR THEY WERE AFFLICTED WITH WEAK CONSTITUTIONS AND MISCHIEVOUSLY FELL ILL WHEN THEY WERE WANTED AT REHEARSAL OR THEY HAD PURITAN RELATIVES IN THE BACKGROUND AND AFTER SLIPPING INTO THEIR PARTS
OR SETTLING TOGETHER IN A HEAP THEY FORMED A SOLID MASS AS THE WATERS WERE CONTAINED IN NO BED
IN THE REGION WHICH EXTENDS BETWEEN EDINBURGH AND GLASGOW FOR A DISTANCE OF TEN OR TWELVE MILES
ALL THE FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY SUDDENLY BECAME UNRELIABLE PEOPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES AFTER ENCOURAGING THE IDEA OF THE PLAY THEY DECLINED THE PERSONAL SACRIFICE OF ACTING IN IT OR THEY ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED A LAD OF EIGHTEEN AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF SIR ANTHONY ABSOLUTE THE STAGE MANAGER UNDERTAKING TO SUPPLY THE NECESSARY WRINKLES FROM THE ILLIMITABLE RESOURCES OF THEATRICAL ART
FROM THE NECKS OF THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF SELTZER WATER BOTTLES THIS LIQUID LOADED WITH CARBONIC ACID RUSHED IN TORRENTS OVER A DEEP SOFT SOIL SUBJECT TO SUDDEN OR SLOW ALTERATIONS OF FORM
THEY RUSHED WHERE THEY LIKED TEARING FROM THE SCARCELY FORMED ROCKS MATERIAL WITH WHICH TO COMPOSE SCHISTS SANDSTONES AND LIMESTONES THIS THE ROVING WAVES BORE OVER THE SUBMERGED AND NOW PEATY FORESTS
DISCOURAGING ISN'T IT GOODNIGHT
SHE BOWED TO THEM WITH IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY ASCENDED THE HOUSE STEPS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE AT A WALK INSTEAD OF A RUN AND RETIRED THEN AND THERE TO THE BEDROOM REGIONS
WERE HANDED TO THEIR REPRESENTATIVES ON THE SPOT FRANK'S FAINT REMONSTRANCES WERE REJECTED WITHOUT A HEARING THE DAYS AND HOURS OF REHEARSAL WERE CAREFULLY NOTED DOWN ON THE COVERS OF THE PARTS AND THE MARRABLES TOOK THEIR LEAVE
MAGDALEN PRESENTED HERSELF TO THE GENERAL OBSERVATION UNDER AN ENTIRELY NEW ASPECT IF ANY MORE VISITORS CALL TO DAY SHE SAID WITH THE PROFOUNDEST GRAVITY OF LOOK AND MANNER
AND WE HAVE BUT FEW WANTS WELL HARRY SAID THE ENGINEER LEAD THE WAY
AND UNDER THE ACTION OF CARBONIC ACID NOW AT THE TIME WHEN THE EVENTS RELATED IN THIS STORY TOOK PLACE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MINES OF THE SCOTTISH COAL BEDS HAD BEEN EXHAUSTED BY TOO RAPID WORKING
I AM AT YOUR ORDERS REPLIED HARRY TELL ME HARRY IS YOUR FATHER WELL VERY WELL MISTER STARR AND YOUR MOTHER SHE IS WELL TOO
AND THERE THE THEATRICAL PROCEEDINGS CAME TO A PAUSE NINE MORE SPEAKING CHARACTERS WERE LEFT TO BE FITTED WITH REPRESENTATIVES AND WITH THAT UNAVOIDABLE NECESSITY THE SERIOUS TROUBLES BEGAN
FOR NORAH AND HIMSELF MISSUS VANSTONE DECLINED ACCOMPANYING THEM ON ACCOUNT OF HER HEALTH AND MISS GARTH ONLY ENGAGED TO MAKE ONE AMONG THE AUDIENCE CONDITIONALLY ON NOT BEING WANTED AT HOME THE PARTS OF LUCY AND FALKLAND
A REGULAR CHEMICAL OPERATION A SORT OF DISTILLATION ALL THE CARBON CONTAINED IN THESE VEGETABLES HAD AGGLOMERATED AND LITTLE BY LITTLE COAL WAS FORMING UNDER THE DOUBLE INFLUENCE OF ENORMOUS PRESSURE
ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING MISSUS VANSTONE'S SPIRITS HAD BEEN SADLY DEPRESSED AT A PRIVATE INTERVIEW WITH MISS GARTH SHE HAD REFERRED AGAIN OF HER OWN ACCORD TO THE SUBJECT OF HER LETTER FROM LONDON
THE WHOLE OF THE MASSIVE FORESTS AND WHAT WENT ON IN THIS GIGANTIC CRUCIBLE WHERE ALL THIS VEGETABLE MATTER HAD ACCUMULATED SUNK TO VARIOUS DEPTHS
WITH THIS LAMENTABLE STORY AND WITH THE HUMBLEST APOLOGIES FOR PRESUMING ON A SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE THE MARRABLES APPEARED AT COMBE RAVEN TO APPEAL TO THE YOUNG LADIES FOR A LUCY
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW SEAM OF COAL WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT EVENT COULD SIMON FORD'S COMMUNICATION RELATE TO A FACT OF THIS NATURE
THE OLD MINER HAD EVIDENTLY NOT WRITTEN IT BUT NO LESS EVIDENTLY THE AUTHOR OF THIS SECOND LETTER KNEW THE OVERMAN'S SECRET SINCE IT EXPRESSLY CONTRADICTED THE INVITATION TO THE
UNDER A THICK CARAPACE OF PUDDING STONE SCHIST
ALL BE SERIOUS ENOUGH IF YOU HAD MY RESPONSIBILITIES NO PAPA NO WINE TO DAY THANK YOU I MUST KEEP MY INTELLIGENCE CLEAR WATER THOMAS AND A LITTLE MORE JELLY I THINK BEFORE YOU TAKE IT AWAY
WHAT IS YOUR HEAD RUNNING ON NOW THOUGHT MISS GARTH CASTING A SHARP LOOK AT NORAH'S DARK DOWNCAST FACE YOU'RE ONE OF THE IMPENETRABLE SORT GIVE ME MAGDALEN WITH ALL HER PERVERSITIES I CAN SEE DAYLIGHT THROUGH HER
DINNER TIME PRESENTED THE FAIR STUDENT TO THE FAMILY EYE IN THE SAME MENTALLY ABSORBED ASPECT ON ALL ORDINARY OCCASIONS MAGDALEN'S APPETITE WOULD HAVE TERRIFIED THOSE FEEBLE SENTIMENTALISTS
ADDRESSED TO AN AUDIENCE WHICH INCLUDED A FATHER OF MISTER VANSTONE'S DISPOSITION AND A DAUGHTER OF MAGDALEN'S TEMPERAMENT PRODUCED THE RESULT WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED FROM THE FIRST
AND MAINTAINED IN ITS SEMI FLUID STATE AS MUCH BY THE HEAT OF THE SUN AS BY THE FIRES OF THE INTERIOR MASS THE INTERNAL HEAT HAD NOT AS YET BEEN COLLECTED IN THE CENTER OF THE GLOBE THE TERRESTRIAL CRUST THIN AND INCOMPLETELY HARDENED
WITH THE PART HANGING OPEN IN HIS HAND THE MOST INCAPABLE OF FALKLANDS AND THE MOST HELPLESS OF MANKIND FRANK'S DEPARTURE LEFT THE FAMILY BY THEMSELVES
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY BE THINKING OF ANDREW WHEN YOU GAVE YOUR CONSENT
ACTORS AND ACTRESSES WERE SOUGHT WITH A DESPERATE DISREGARD OF ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF PERSONAL FITNESS NECESSITY WHICH KNOWS NO LAW EITHER IN THE DRAMA OR OUT OF IT
AND BROUGHT WITH HER THE DRAMATIC QUALIFICATION OF HABITUALLY WEARING A WIG IN PRIVATE LIFE THANKS TO THESE VIGOROUS MEASURES THE PLAY WAS AT LAST SUPPLIED WITH REPRESENTATIVES
SHOWS THAT FORD'S COMMUNICATION MUST BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO MORROW AT THE APPOINTED TIME I SHALL BE AT THE RENDEZVOUS IN THE EVENING STARR MADE HIS PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE
AS IT MIGHT HAPPEN THAT HIS ABSENCE WOULD BE PROLONGED FOR SOME DAYS HE WROTE TO SIR W ELPHISTON
MISS MAGDALEN SAYS IT SOOTHES HER FEELINGS AND CLEARS HER MIND KNOWING BY EXPERIENCE THAT INTERFERENCE WOULD BE HOPELESS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MISS GARTH TURNED SHARPLY AND LEFT THE ROOM
QUITE RIGHT MY DEAR OBSERVED MISTER VANSTONE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS YOU SAY WERE DEAD AGAINST ME HERE WERE THESE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE IN A SCRAPE ON ONE SIDE AND MAGDALEN ON THE OTHER MAD TO ACT
THIS WAS THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH JAMES STARR ARRIVED AFTER MATURE REFLECTION THE CONTRADICTION WHICH EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO LETTERS ONLY WROUGHT IN HIM A MORE KEEN DESIRE TO VISIT THE DOCHART PIT AND BESIDES
HAD REFERRED TO THE APPROACHING THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE AND HAD RELIEVED MISSUS VANSTONE'S MIND OF ALL ANXIETY IN THAT DIRECTION BY ANNOUNCING HER INTENTION OF ACCOMPANYING MAGDALEN TO EACH REHEARSAL
TAKING LEAVE OF MISTER VANSTONE AT THE HALL DOOR I'M TO COME TO MORROW AND HEAR MORE OF HER VIEWS IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION I SHALL NEVER DO IT DON'T TELL HER I SAID SO
ROLLING AND UNROLLING HIS PART AND LOOKING PITEOUSLY IN THE FACES OF THE FRIENDS ABOUT HIM I KNOW I CAN'T DO IT HE SAID MAY I COME IN AFTER TEA AND HEAR MAGDALEN'S VIEWS THANK YOU
GASTRIC MARTYRDOM I HAVE CONCEIVED THE PART OF LUCY SHE OBSERVED WITH THE DEMUREST GRAVITY THE NEXT DIFFICULTY IS TO MAKE FRANK CONCEIVE THE PART OF FALKLAND I SEE NOTHING TO LAUGH AT YOU WOULD
THREE FULL REHEARSALS WERE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
OF A WOMAN OF TWICE HER AGE SHE LITERALLY FORCED HIM INTO HIS PART HER FATHER FELL ASLEEP IN HIS CHAIR MISSUS VANSTONE AND MISS GARTH LOST THEIR INTEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS
AND FADED OUT OF IT ALTOGETHER IN THE LATTER HALF OBJECTED TO PASS FROM THE NOTICE OF THE AUDIENCE IN THAT MANNER WHEN ALL THE REST HAD A CHANCE OF DISTINGUISHING THEMSELVES TO THE END SHUT UP THE BOOK APOLOGIZED AND RETIRED
THE PALACE OF THE FORMER SOVEREIGNS OF SCOTLAND HE DID NOT NOTICE THE SENTINELS WHO STOOD BEFORE ITS GATEWAYS DRESSED IN THE UNIFORM OF THEIR HIGHLAND REGIMENT TARTAN KILT PLAID AND SPORRAN COMPLETE
AND WAS THE SIGNAL ACCORDINGLY FOR AN ATTACK ON MISTER VANSTONE'S INVETERATE CARELESSNESS IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS PATERNAL AUTHORITY
THAT THE WHOLE EARTH BENEATH IT SEEMED TO BE FILLED THEREWITH THIS IS THE DREAM WHICH THOU SAWEST AND ITS INTERPRETATION IS AS FOLLOWS THE HEAD OF GOLD DENOTES THEE AND THE KINGS OF BABYLON THAT HAVE BEEN BEFORE THEE
HE MIGHT BE SURE THAT TIFTO WOULD BE LAID ASIDE
SHE HAD HELPED THE FOX TO ESCAPE FROM A TRAP AND THE FOX HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN HER KINDNESS TO HIM O LITTLE WHITE HEN WHERE ARE YOU GOING ASKED THE FOX
BUT IT IS OF NO USE THE THING IS SETTLED PAPA CAN BREAK MY HEART
HE HAD SO COMMITTED HIMSELF THAT THE OFFER MUST NOW BE MADE HE DID NOT SPECIALLY REGRET THAT THOUGH HE WISHED THAT HE HAD BEEN MORE RETICENT WHAT A FOOL A MAN IS TO BLURT OUT EVERYTHING HE SAID TO HIMSELF A WIFE WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR HIM
BUT THE DUKE'S CHARACTER ADDED MUCH TO THE SEVERITY OF THE TASK AND THEN THAT EMBRACE SHE KNEW THAT THE DUKE WOULD BE STRUCK WITH HORROR AS HE READ OF SUCH A TALE AND SHE FOUND HERSELF ALMOST STRUCK WITH HORROR AS SHE ATTEMPTED TO WRITE IT
WITH ALL MY HEART SAID TREGEAR SIT DOWN HERE SAID SILVERBRIDGE
OH HOW DOES THIS GO OH
AND COMMANDED THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WHEN THEY SHOULD HEAR THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET THEY SHOULD THEN FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP THE IMAGE
WHAT SAID VAN COOLING OFF A LITTLE AND ALLOWING PERCY TO EDGE INTO A CORNER WITH THE BELOVED BOAT AND ONE SAIL WHAT WILL YOU POLLY I'LL MAKE YOU ANOTHER PAIR OF SAILS SAID POLLY
THAT TOOK ALL POLLY'S PATIENCE TO UNRAVEL IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE IN SUCH A HURRY SAID MISSUS PEPPER
THAT SHALL BE LIKE UNTO IRON SHALL PUT AN END TO THE POWER OF THE FORMER AND SHALL HAVE DOMINION OVER ALL THE EARTH ON ACCOUNT OF THE NATURE OF IRON WHICH IS STRONGER THAN THAT OF GOLD OF SILVER AND OF BRASS
SHE CARRIED THE LETTER VERY CAREFULLY IN HER LITTLE BROWN BASKET IT WAS A LONG DISTANCE TO THE ROYAL PALACE WHERE THE KING LIVED THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD NEVER BEEN SO FAR FROM HOME IN ALL HER LIFE
WE DID MEET AS YOU SAW THE OTHER DAY BY THE MEREST CHANCE AFTER THAT DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR SISTER WISHES ME TO GIVE HER UP AS FOR SUPPOSING THAT GIRLS ARE TO HAVE WHAT THEY WISH THAT IS NONSENSE
I WOULD RATHER YOU WROTE THE LETTER SAID LADY MARY BUT PRAY TELL HIM THAT ALL ALONG I HAVE MEANT HIM TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT TILL LADY CANTRIP SEATED HERSELF AT HER WRITING TABLE
HE FELL UPON THE FOWLS OF THE ROYAL POULTRY YARD NOT A SINGLE FOWL WAS LEFT ALIVE THERE WAS SUCH A GREAT COMMOTION THAT THE KING THE QUEEN THE ROYAL ATTENDANTS AND ALL THE ROYAL SERVANTS OF THE PALACE
AND PIANO PLAYING ISN'T VERY NICE WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO STICK YOUR TOES UNDER IT TO KEEP YOUR SHOES ON WELL THEN GRUMBLED POLLY
ARIOCH FROM THAT TIME SECURELY TOOK HIMSELF WHAT THE KING SENT EVERY DAY FROM HIS SUPPER ACCORDING TO CUSTOM TO THE CHILDREN BUT GAVE THEM THE FOREMENTIONED DIET
WHERE IS THE WORK BASKET MAMSIE OH HERE IT IS ON THE WINDOW SEAT A RATTLE OF SPOOLS SCISSORS AND NECESSARY UTENSILS SHOWED PLAINLY THAT POLLY HAD FOUND IT FOLLOWED BY A JUMBLE OF WORDS AND DESPAIRING EJACULATIONS
WHICH COURSE HE TOOK ALSO WITH THOSE OF OTHER NATIONS WHOM HE HAD TAKEN IN THE FLOWER OF THEIR AGE AND AFFORDED THEM THEIR DIET FROM HIS OWN TABLE AND HAD THEM INSTRUCTED IN THE INSTITUTES OF THE COUNTRY AND TAUGHT THE LEARNING OF THE CHALDEANS
AND NOW STOOD TO LOSE SOME TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS ON THE DOINGS OF THE LAST NIGHT AND HE HAD MADE THESE BETS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MAJOR TIFTO
WHEN SHE CAME TO THE POINT SHE FOUND SHE COULD NOT WRITE IT I FEAR THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF WARMTH SHOWN ON BOTH SIDES SHE SAID FEELING THAT SHE WAS CALUMNIATING THE MAN AS TO WHOSE WARMTH SHE HAD HEARD NOTHING
THERE NOW LET MOTHER SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER OH DEAR SAID POLLY RESIGNING THE NEEDLE WITH A BIG SIGH AND LEANING BACK TO TAKE A GOOD STRETCH FOLLOWED BY PHRONSIE'S SYMPATHIZING EYES
THEN THE FIRE WHICH HAD CHANGED ITSELF INTO HOT ASHES JUMPED OUT OF THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET IT IMMEDIATELY BECAME DARK SO DARK THAT THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD COULD NOT EVEN SEE EACH OTHER'S FACES AND OF COURSE
BUT STILL IT SEEMED HARD TO HIM THAT THIS INTENTION OF MARRIAGE SHOULD STAND IN HIS WAY OF HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH MISS BONCASSEN FOR A FEW WEEKS NO DOUBT THERE WERE OBJECTIONS TO MARRIAGE IT CLIPPED A FELLOW'S WINGS BUT THEN IF HE WERE MARRIED
I NEVER DID SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE BEFORE BUT AS HE WAS THERE I HAD TO SHOW THAT I WAS NOT ASHAMED OF HIM
SINCE THEY CONFESSED THEY COULD NOT DO WHAT THEY WERE COMMANDED TO DO NOW WHEN DANIEL HEARD THAT THE KING HAD GIVEN A COMMAND THAT ALL THE WISE MEN SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH
THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD ALL RAN AFTER HER IN SWIFT PURSUIT THEY HAD ALMOST CAUGHT HER WHEN THE RIVER SUDDENLY SPRANG OUT OF THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET AND FLOWED BETWEEN THE LITTLE WHITE HEN AND HER ROYAL PURSUERS THEY COULDN'T GET ACROSS WITHOUT CANOES
BUT THE LEGS AND THE FEET OF IRON AFTER WHICH THOU SAWEST A STONE
HE MADE AN IMAGE OF GOLD WHOSE HEIGHT WAS SIXTY CUBITS AND ITS BREADTH SIX CUBITS AND SET IT IN THE GREAT PLAIN OF BABYLON AND WHEN HE WAS GOING TO DEDICATE THE IMAGE HE INVITED THE PRINCIPAL MEN OUT OF ALL THE EARTH THAT WAS UNDER HIS DOMINIONS
BUT YET AS HE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN HE SHUDDERED WITH VEXATION I WAS THINKING OF THE GOVERNOR HE SAID HE SHALL BE TOLD EVERYTHING THAT YOU MET TREGEAR CERTAINLY AND THAT I KISSED HIM
THAT IT COULD NOT CONSUME THEM THIS IT WAS WHICH RECOMMENDED THEM TO THE KING AS RIGHTEOUS MEN AND MEN BELOVED OF GOD
THAT WAS KIND AND I WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO YOU ALL THIS ABOUT MY SISTER MUST BE GIVEN UP MUST BE GIVEN UP IT CAN NEVER LEAD TO ANY GOOD I MEAN THAT THERE NEVER CAN BE A MARRIAGE THEN HE PAUSED
IT WAS SIMPLY AN ACCIDENT SUCH AN ACCIDENT AS MUST OCCUR OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNLESS MARY IS TO BE LOCKED UP WHO TALKS OF LOCKING ANYBODY UP WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO SPEAK IN THAT WAY
SHE HANDED THE KING THE PIECE OF PAPER WHICH HAD REMAINED ALL THIS TIME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET THERE WERE MARKS OF DIRT UPON IT WHERE THE FRIENDLY FOX'S FEET HAD RESTED IT WAS DAMP WHERE THE RIVER HAD LAIN
HE CAME TO ARIOCH AND DESIRED HIM TO BRING HIM TO THE KING
AFTER A WHILE SHE MET A FRIENDLY FOX FOXES AND LITTLE WHITE HENS ARE NOT USUALLY VERY GOOD FRIENDS YOU KNOW BUT THIS FOX WAS A FRIEND OF THE LITTLE WHITE HEN ONCE UPON A TIME
SAID PHRONSIE TUCKING UP HER TOES UNDER THE NIGHT GOWN BUT POLLY HURRIED HER INTO BED
HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BACK THE PRIME MINISTER FOR THE LEGER TO A VERY SERIOUS AMOUNT
HOW THE SPECKLED HEN GOT HER SPECKLES ONCE UPON A TIME AGES AND AGES AGO THERE WAS A LITTLE WHITE HEN ONE DAY SHE WAS BUSILY ENGAGED IN SCRATCHING THE SOIL
TAKE THIS STUPID LITTLE WHITE HEN AND THROW HER OUT INTO THE ROYAL POULTRY YARD I THINK WE WILL HAVE HER FOR DINNER TO MORROW THE LITTLE WHITE HEN WAS ROUGHLY SEIZED BY THE TALLEST ROYAL ATTENDANT AND CARRIED DOWN THE BACK STAIRS
NOW I WANT YOU TO TELL PAPA ALL ABOUT IT LADY CANTRIP BEGAN TO THINK THAT IT HAD BEEN AN EVIL DAY FOR HER WHEN SHE HAD AGREED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THIS VERY DETERMINED YOUNG LADY BUT SHE CONSENTED AT ONCE TO WRITE TO THE DUKE
AND TO ABSTAIN FROM THOSE KINDS OF FOOD WHICH CAME FROM THE KING'S TABLE AND ENTIRELY TO FORBEAR TO EAT OF ALL LIVING CREATURES
NOW I TOO EVEN I THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAVE A LETTER I AM GOING TO CARRY MY LETTER TO THE KING THE NEXT MORNING THE LITTLE WHITE HEN STARTED BRAVELY OUT ON HER LONG JOURNEY
POLLY SAID MISSUS PEPPER STERNLY DEFTLY FASTENING THE LITTLE BUTTONS TIGHTLY INTO PLACE WITH QUICK FIRM STITCHES BETTER BE GLAD YOU'VE GOT THEM TO SEW AT ALL THERE NOW HERE THEY ARE
THAT THEY SHOULD NOW PRESERVE THEIR LIVES OF WHICH THEY DESPAIRED BEFORE AND HAD THEIR MINDS FULL OF NOTHING BUT THE THOUGHTS OF DYING SO WHEN HE HAD WITH THEM RETURNED THANKS TO GOD WHO HAD COMMISERATED THEIR YOUTH WHEN IT WAS DAY
IN MY LITTLE BROWN BASKET THE FOX CLIMBED INTO THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET AFTER THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD GONE ON FOR SOME DISTANCE FARTHER SHE MET A RIVER ONCE UPON A TIME THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD DONE THE RIVER A KINDNESS
AND THEN MISTER KING CAME IN AND TOOK JASPER OFF WITH HIM
BUT THE YOUNG MAN RETIRED TO HIS OWN HOUSE WITH HIS KINSMEN AND BESOUGHT GOD THAT WHOLE NIGHT TO DISCOVER THE DREAM AND THEREBY DELIVER THE MAGICIANS AND CHALDEANS WITH WHOM THEY WERE THEMSELVES TO PERISH FROM THE KING'S ANGER
SO THESE MEN WERE CONVICTED AND CAST IMMEDIATELY INTO THE FIRE BUT WERE SAVED BY DIVINE PROVIDENCE
FOR AFTER HE HAD CONTINUED IN THE WILDERNESS THE FOREMENTIONED INTERVAL OF TIME WHILE NO ONE DURST ATTEMPT TO SEIZE HIS KINGDOM DURING THOSE SEVEN YEARS HE PRAYED TO GOD THAT HE MIGHT RECOVER HIS KINGDOM AND HE RETURNED TO IT
O LITTLE WHITE HEN MAY I GO WITH YOU ASKED THE RIVER THE LITTLE WHITE HEN TOLD THE RIVER THAT HE MIGHT GO WITH HER AND ASKED HIM TO RIDE IN THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET SO THE RIVER CLIMBED INTO THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET
AFTER THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD JOURNEYED ALONG FOR A TIME SHE CAME TO A FIRE ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE FIRE HAD BEEN DYING THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD BROUGHT SOME DRIED GRASS THE GRASS HAD GIVEN THE FIRE NEW LIFE
BUT TWAS ALL OF NO USE THE DAY SEEMED TO BE ALWAYS JUST RACING AHEAD OF HER AND TURNING A CORNER BEFORE SHE COULD CATCH UP TO IT AND BEN AND THE OTHER BOYS ONLY CAUGHT DISSOLVING VIEWS OF HER AS SHE FLITTED THROUGH HALLS OR OVER STAIRS
I AM HIGHLY OFFENDED I ALWAYS KNEW THAT HENS WERE STUPID LITTLE CREATURES BUT YOU ARE QUITE THE STUPIDEST LITTLE HEN I EVER SAW IN ALL MY LIFE HERE AND HE TURNED TO ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS STANDING BY THE THRONE
I KNEW HE HAD A FEW HORSES THERE IT IS NOT THE MONEY BUT THE ABSENCE OF PRINCIPLE THAT A YOUNG MAN SHOULD HAVE NO FEELING THAT HE OUGHT TO LIVE WITHIN CERTAIN PRESCRIBED MEANS
SILVERBRIDGE FOUND IT TO BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY ANYTHING IN ANSWER TO THIS ARE YOU GOING TO CHURCH ASKED THE DUKE I WAS NOT THINKING OF DOING SO PARTICULARLY DO YOU NOT EVER GO
I THINK I PERHAPS MIGHT EXPRESS SUCH AN OPINION WELL THEN I HAVE TO EXAMINE MYSELF AND FIND OUT WHETHER I AM GUILTY OF THE MEANNESS WHICH I MIGHT PERHAPS BE TOO READY TO IMPUTE TO ANOTHER I HAVE DONE SO
SINCE I HAVE ONLY UNDERTAKEN TO DESCRIBE THINGS PAST OR THINGS PRESENT BUT NOT THINGS THAT ARE FUTURE YET IF ANY ONE BE SO VERY DESIROUS OF KNOWING TRUTH AS NOT TO WAVE SUCH POINTS OF CURIOSITY AND CANNOT CURB HIS INCLINATION
BUT OF WHOM YOU WOULD SAY AFTER DUE OBSERVATION THAT HE HAD NOT AS YET PUT OFF ALL HIS CHILDISH WAYS HE NOW SAT WITH HIS LEGS STRETCHED OUT WITH HIS CANE IN HIS HANDS
I WISH THEY'D ALL GO THEY MIGHT AS WELL SHE CRIED TOSSING THAT BOOT ON THE FLOOR IN INTENSE SCORN WHILE SHE INVESTIGATED THE STATE OF THE OTHER ONE
SAID POLLY SITTING DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND PULLING ON HER STOCKINGS THERE NOW SEE THAT HATEFUL OLD SHOE MAMSIE AND SHE THRUST OUT ONE FOOT IN DISMAY WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH IT
SHOULD BE CAST INTO A FIERY FURNACE WHEN THEREFORE ALL THE REST UPON THE HEARING OF THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET WORSHIPPED THE IMAGE THEY RELATE THAT DANIEL'S KINSMEN DID NOT DO IT BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT TRANSGRESS THE LAWS OF THEIR COUNTRY
YOU'RE A MEAN OLD HATEFUL THING PERCY WHITNEY OH DON'T
BUT THE TWO HANDS AND ARMS SIGNIFY THIS THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT SHALL BE DISSOLVED BY TWO KINGS BUT ANOTHER KING THAT SHALL COME FROM THE WEST ARMED WITH BRASS SHALL DESTROY THAT GOVERNMENT AND ANOTHER GOVERNMENT
O LITTLE WHITE HEN WHERE ARE YOU GOING THE RIVER CALLED OUT AS SOON AS HE SAW HER
AND YOU SHAN'T HAVE EM SO HE CRIED MAKING A LUNGE AT THE ONE ON THE TABLE FOR I MADE MOST OF THE BOAT THERE OH NO YOU DIDN'T CRIED PERCY IN THE GREATEST ALARM
AS VAN BOUNDED IN WITH A TORRENT OF COMPLAINTS AND GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT IN EVERY LINE OF HIS FACE OH NOW THAT'S TOO BAD HE CRIED SEEING POLLY FOLD UP THE REMAINING BITS OF CLOTH
IF YOU ALL HAD NOT BEEN THERE THEN AGAIN SHE BURST INTO TEARS HE DID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT
THAT WAS WHEN I WAS EVER SO LITTLE
THROUGH THE BACK GATE OUT INTO THE ROYAL POULTRY YARD SHE STILL CLUNG TO THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER ON HER LONG JOURNEY TO THE ROYAL PALACE AND THROUGH ALL THE SAD EXPERIENCES SHE HAD MET THERE WHEN THE LITTLE WHITE HEN REACHED THE ROYAL POULTRY YARD
WATCHING HER MAKE A BIG KNOT BUT THE KNOT DIDN'T STAY FOR WHEN POLLY DREW UP THE LONG THREAD TRIUMPHANTLY TO THE END OUT IT FLEW AND AWAY THE BUTTON HOPPED AGAIN AS IF GLAD TO BE RELEASED AND THEN THE THREAD KINKED HORRIBLY
AND THEY HAD NOW EXERCISED THEMSELVES SUFFICIENTLY IN THAT WISDOM WHICH HE HAD ORDERED THEY SHOULD APPLY THEMSELVES TO NOW AMONG THESE THERE WERE FOUR OF THE FAMILY OF ZEDEKIAH OF MOST EXCELLENT DISPOSITIONS ONE OF WHOM WAS CALLED DANIEL
ALL THE ROYAL FOWLS FLEW AT HER SOME PLUCKED AT HER RUMPLED WHITE FEATHERS OTHERS TRIED TO PICK OUT HER EYES ONE PULLED OFF THE COVER OF THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET OUT SPRANG THE FOX FROM THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET
OH THAT CORNER'S COMING OFF CRIED POLLY CHEERFULLY GIVING IT A SHARP CUT
AND WERE THEIRS JUST LIKE THIS ASKED PERCY LAYING HIS HAND ON THE SAIL SHE HAD FINISHED CUTTING OUT PRE CISELY SAID POLLY WITH A PIN IN HER MOUTH JUST AS LIKE AS TWO PEAS PERCY WHITNEY THEN I LIKE THEM CRIED PERCY
I ONLY MEANT THAT OF COURSE THEY WILL STUMBLE ACROSS EACH OTHER IN LONDON I THINK I WILL GO ABROAD SAID THE DUKE HE WAS SILENT FOR AWHILE AND THEN REPEATED HIS WORDS I THINK I WILL GO ABROAD NOT FOR LONG I HOPE SIR
FOR THE FIRE DID NOT TOUCH THEM AND I SUPPOSE THAT IT TOUCHED THEM NOT AS IF IT REASONED WITH ITSELF THAT THEY WERE CAST INTO IT WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF THEIRS AND THAT THEREFORE IT WAS TOO WEAK TO BURN THE YOUNG MEN WHEN THEY WERE IN IT
EVERYTHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH POLLY THAT DAY IT BEGAN WITH HER BOOTS OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD THAT TRIED POLLY'S PATIENCE MOST WERE THE TROUBLESOME LITTLE BLACK BUTTONS THAT ORIGINALLY ADORNED THOSE USEFUL PARTS OF HER CLOTHING
AND HE WAS LEAVING HER WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO THE SCENE WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE WHEN AN IDEA STRUCK HIM THAT THIS WOULD BE CRUEL MARY HE SAID I WAS VERY SORRY FOR ALL THAT IT WAS NOT MY DOING
HE SHOULD REDUCE THEM TO THEIR FORMER DIET NOW WHEN IT APPEARED THAT THEY WERE SO FAR FROM BECOMING WORSE BY THE USE OF THIS FOOD THAT THEY GREW PLUMPER AND FULLER IN BODY THAN THE REST
OH MAMSIE CRIED POLLY IGNORING FOR A MOMENT THE DELIGHTS OF THE FINISHED SHOE TO FLING HER ARMS AROUND HER MOTHER'S NECK AND GIVE HER A GOOD HUG YOU'RE JUST THE SPLENDIDEST GOODEST MAMSIE IN ALL THE WORLD
YOU DID SAY SO POLLY YOU KNOW YOU DID OF COURSE I DID VANNY SAID POLLY
IF YOU MEAN BY CONTROLLING MYSELF HOLDING MY TONGUE HE IS THE MAN I LOVE WHOM I HAVE PROMISED TO MARRY BUT MARY DO LADIES GENERALLY EMBRACE THEIR LOVERS IN PUBLIC NO NOR SHOULD I
AND DESIRED TO KNOW OF HIM WHAT WAS THE REASON WHY THE KING HAD GIVEN COMMAND THAT ALL THE WISE MEN AND CHALDEANS AND MAGICIANS SHOULD BE SLAIN SO WHEN HE HAD LEARNED THAT THE KING HAD HAD A DREAM AND HAD FORGOTTEN IT AND THAT WHEN THEY WERE ENJOINED TO INFORM THE KING OF IT
GROANING WITHIN HERSELF AS SHE THOUGHT OF THE WASTED MINUTES AND THEN YOU CAN SEE ME CUT EM VAN WILL YOU REALLY HE SAID DELIGHT COMING ALL OVER HIS FLUSHED FACE YES I WILL CRIED POLLY
BUT TREGEAR WAS DETERMINED TO HEAR HIM OUT IT IS MAKING MY FATHER SO MISERABLE THAT YOU WOULD PITY HIM IF YOU COULD SEE HIM I DARE SAY I SHOULD WHEN I SEE PEOPLE UNHAPPY I ALWAYS PITY THEM WHAT I WOULD ASK YOU TO THINK OF IS THIS
AND WHERE COULD HE POSSIBLY FIND A BETTER WIFE THAN MABEL GREX IN BEAUTY SHE WAS NO DOUBT INFERIOR TO MISS BONCASSEN THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT MISS BONCASSEN WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FORGET HER BUT MISS BONCASSEN WAS AN AMERICAN AND ON MANY ACCOUNTS OUT OF THE QUESTION
AND THERE GOES THE FIRST BELL AS THE LOUD SOUNDS UNDER JANE'S VIGOROUS RINGING PEALED UP OVER THE STAIRS THERE WON'T BE TIME ANYWAY NOW I WISH THERE WASN'T SUCH A THING AS SHOES IN THE WORLD AND SHE GAVE A FLOUNCE AND SAT UP STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HER MOTHER
IT IS QUITE CLEAR SHE ADDED THAT THIS IS NOT A PASSING FANCY ON HER PART
THAT SILVERBRIDGE HAD TAKEN MARY HE DID UNDERSTAND AND THAT THEY HAD TOGETHER GONE TO LORD GREX'S HOUSE HE UNDERSTOOD ALSO THAT THE MEETING HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE PRESENCE OF SILVERBRIDGE AND OF LADY MABEL NO DOUBT IT WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT
HIMSELF AND HIS THREE KINSMEN WERE IN DANGER
NOT EXACTLY SIR IT IS DIFFERENT WITH YOU BUT A MAN LET HIM BE WHO HE MAY SHOULD LIVE WITHIN CERTAIN MEANS AS FOR YOUR SISTER I THINK SHE WILL BREAK MY HEART
IS IT ASKED PERCY LOOKING WITH MORE RESPECT AT THE PIECE OF CLOTH POLLY WAS WAVING ALLURINGLY BEFORE HIM JUST EXACTLY LIKE IT POLLY YES SAID POLLY
ABEDNEGO THESE THE KING HAD IN ESTEEM AND CONTINUED TO LOVE BECAUSE OF THE VERY EXCELLENT TEMPER THEY WERE OF AND BECAUSE OF THEIR APPLICATION TO LEARNING
BECAUSE IT COULD NOT BE AVOIDED BUT THEIR BODIES AND COLORS MUST BE CHANGED WITH THEIR DIET ESPECIALLY WHILE THEY WOULD BE CLEARLY DISCOVERED BY THE FINER APPEARANCE OF THE OTHER CHILDREN WHO WOULD FARE BETTER AND THUS THEY SHOULD BRING HIM INTO DANGER AND OCCASION HIM TO BE PUNISHED
ALL HEMMED AND EVERYTHING THERE AS SHE HELD ONE UP FOR INSPECTION
I COULDN'T COME BEFORE MAMSIE WANTED ME NOW SAYS I FOR THE SAILS AND SHE BEGAN TO FLAP OUT A LONG WHITE PIECE OF COTTON CLOTH ON THE TABLE TO TRIM INTO JUST THE DESIRED SHAPE THAT ISN'T THE WAY
IT MEANT COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE IN MONEY MATTERS THEN HIS MIND RAN AWAY TO A REVIEW OF HIS FATHER'S AFFAIRS IT WAS A GENUINE TROUBLE TO HIM THAT HIS FATHER SHOULD BE SO UNHAPPY OF ALL THE GRIEFS WHICH WEIGHED UPON THE DUKE'S MIND
AND TO PUT OFF THEIR SLAUGHTER SO LONG FOR THAT HE HOPED WITHIN THAT TIME TO OBTAIN BY PRAYER TO GOD THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DREAM ACCORDINGLY ARIOCH INFORMED THE KING OF WHAT DANIEL DESIRED
I WILL DO NOTHING THAT I AM ASHAMED TO TELL EVERYBODY HE WILL BE VERY ANGRY I CANNOT HELP IT HE SHOULD NOT TREAT ME AS HE IS DOING MISTER TREGEAR IS A GENTLEMAN WHY DID HE LET HIM COME WHY DID YOU BRING HIM
SAID POLLY SNIPPING AWAY VIGOROUSLY AND LONGING TO GET BACK TO MAMSIE
SAID MISSUS PEPPER STRAIGHTENING THE THINGS ON THE BUREAU YOU HAVEN'T WORN IT OUT ALREADY POLLY OH NO SAID POLLY WITH A LITTLE LAUGH
AND MADE HIM AND HIS KINSMEN RULERS OF HIS WHOLE KINGDOM WHICH KINSMEN OF HIS HAPPENED TO FALL INTO GREAT DANGER BY THE ENVY AND MALICE OF THEIR ENEMIES FOR THEY OFFENDED THE KING UPON THE OCCASION FOLLOWING
FOR IT WAS I FEAR IN THAT WAY THAT HE HAD LOOKED AT IT DID NOT SEE ANY REASON FOR PERFORMING A DUTY WHICH HIS FATHER HIMSELF OMITTED AND THERE WERE VARIOUS MATTERS ALSO WHICH HARASSED HIM ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AFTER DINNER
ON THAT NIGHT MARY TOLD THE WHOLE OF HER STORY TO LADY CANTRIP THERE WAS NOTHING THAT SHE TRIED TO CONCEAL I GOT UP SHE SAID AND THREW MY ARMS ROUND HIM IS HE NOT ALL THE WORLD TO ME
AND I'M A HATEFUL CROSS OLD BEAR SO I AM SHE CRIED REMORSEFULLY BUTTONING HERSELF INTO HER BOOTS
BUT TO GIVE THEM PULSE AND DATES FOR THEIR FOOD AND ANY THING ELSE BESIDES THE FLESH OF LIVING CREATURES THAT HE PLEASED FOR THAT THEIR INCLINATIONS WERE TO THAT SORT OF FOOD AND THAT THEY DESPISED THE OTHER
HE HAD WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THROWN SOME UGLY WORMS UPON THE BANK AND HE WAS AFRAID THEY WOULD CRAWL BACK IN AGAIN THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD EATEN THEM FOR HIM ALWAYS AFTER THAT THE RIVER HAD BEEN HER FRIEND
OH NO I WON'T I WON'T HE CRIED IN THE GREATEST ALARM
SO THEY READILY UNDERSTOOD ALL THE LEARNING THAT WAS AMONG THE HEBREWS AND AMONG THE CHALDEANS AS ESPECIALLY DID DANIEL WHO BEING ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY SKILLFUL IN WISDOM WAS VERY BUSY ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS
WHEN UPON THEIR ENTIRE INABILITY TO DISCOVER HIS DREAM HE WAS UNDERTAKING TO INFORM HIM OF IT FOR THIS WAS NOT BY HIS OWN SKILL OR ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HAVING BETTER CULTIVATED HIS UNDERSTANDING THAN THE REST BUT HE SAID
FOR YOUNG MEN I SUPPOSE EQUALLY SO LIFE OUGHT TO BE A LIFE OF SELF DENIAL NO DOUBT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MY DUTY TO RETIRE FROM THIS AFFAIR IF BY DOING SO I SHOULD SACRIFICE ONLY MYSELF
NOBODY'LL SEE ME IF I TUCK MY FOOT UNDER THE PIANO AND I CAN SEW EM ON AFTERWARDS THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF TIME DO JUST ONCE MAMSIE NO SAID MISSUS PEPPER FIRMLY THERE ISN'T ANY TIME BUT NOW
THE LITTLE WHITE HEN BOWED VERY LOW BEFORE THE KING SO LOW IN FACT THAT IT MUSSED UP ALL HER FEATHERS WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS ASKED THE KING IN HIS BIG DEEP KINGLY VOICE
TO CARRY A LETTER TO THE KING INDEED LITTLE WHITE HEN SAID THE FOX
SAID JASPER QUICKLY YOU'RE ALWAYS TEASING HER TO DO SOMETHING HE ADDED I DIDN'T TEASE SAID PERCY INDIGNANTLY COMING UP TO THE SOFA BOAT IN HAND TO ENFORCE HIS WORDS
LADY CANTRIP WROTE HOW COULD IT BE AN ACCIDENT YOU HAD MARY UP IN TOWN ON FRIDAY
WITH A LITTLE LAUGH BEGINNING TO BE VERY MUCH ASHAMED WHAT COULD YOU DO WITH YOUR LITTLE MITES OF HANDS PULLING THIS BIG THREAD THROUGH THAT OLD LEATHER
WAIT A MINUTE TILL I GET SOME MORE CLOTH AND SHE STARTED FOR THE DOOR OH NOW THAT'S TOO BAD SAID JASPER
KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR SAW A WONDERFUL DREAM THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF WHICH GOD SHOWED HIM IN HIS SLEEP BUT WHEN HE AROSE OUT OF HIS BED HE FORGOT THE ACCOMPLISHMENT SO HE SENT FOR THE CHALDEANS AND MAGICIANS AND THE PROPHETS AND TOLD THEM THAT HE HAD SEEN A DREAM
WHY SHE SAID SHE'D MAKE VAN AND ME OUR SAILS YOU KNOW SAID PERCY HOLDING UP A RATHER FORLORN LOOKING SPECIMEN OF A BOAT BUT WHICH THE BOYS HAD CARVED WITH THE GREATEST ENTHUSIASM
THE MONEY WHICH GERALD OWED AT CAMBRIDGE WOULD BE NOTHING IF THAT OTHER SORROW COULD BE CONQUERED
AND WE'LL HAVE A SPLENDID PAIR IN JUST ONE MINUTE SHE SANG AND SO THE SAILS WERE CUT OUT AND THE HEMS TURNED DOWN AND BASTED AND TUCKED AWAY INTO POLLY'S LITTLE WORK BASKET READY FOR THE SEWING ON THE MORROW
THIS WAS DONE BY THE POWER OF GOD
THEY'RE TOO BIG SAID PERCY SURVEYING THEM CRITICALLY
YOU ARE QUITE AT LIBERTY TO TELL HIM THAT I SAY SO I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK YOUR FATHER FOR A PENNY AND I WILL NEVER DO SO THE POWER IS ALL IN HIS HANDS AS FAR AS I KNOW MY OWN PURPOSES I SHALL NOT MAKE ANY IMMEDIATE ATTEMPT EVEN TO SEE HER
IF TREGEAR COULD BE GOT OUT OF THE WAY HIS FATHER HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE RECONCILED TO OTHER THINGS HE FELT VERY TENDER HEARTED ABOUT HIS FATHER
THIS MUST BE A LETTER ONE TIME WHEN THE KING THE GREAT RULER OF OUR COUNTRY
YET NEVER ONCE BY ANY KNIGHT HAVE I BEEN BORNE FROM MY HORSE THIS DAY I AM OVERTHROWN BY A BOY AND YET I CANNOT HELP BUT LOVE THEE THE VARLET ANSWERED
WHEN THE DAMSEL PERCEIVED HOW IT WAS WITH HER SHE SENT MESSAGES TO HER FRIEND TELLING HIM OF HER CASE AND MAKING GREAT SORROW I HAVE LOST MY FATHER AND ALL HIS WEALTH SAID THE LADY FOR WHEN HE HEARS OF THIS MATTER HE WILL MAKE OF ME AN EXAMPLE
KNIGHTS OF FLANDERS AND OF FRANCE WERE THERE IN PLENTY BUT FEW FARED FROM ENGLAND
WHO MIGHT NEVER WIN TOGETHER THERE WAS NO SPEECH BETWEEN THEM SAVE THAT CARRIED BY THE BIRD THEY CAUSED THE SWAN TO FAST FOR THREE DAYS AND THEN SENT HIM ON HIS ERRAND HE TO WHOM THE LETTER CAME SAW TO IT THAT THE MESSENGER WAS FED TO HEART'S DESIRE
THOUGH THIS BARON WAS A WORTHY KNIGHT JUSTLY ESTEEMED OF ALL HIS FELLOWS THE DAMSEL WAS GRIEVED BEYOND MEASURE WHEN SHE KNEW HER FATHER'S WILL SHE CALLED TO MIND THE PAST AND REGRETTED THAT MILON HAD GONE FROM THE COUNTRY SINCE HE WOULD HAVE HELPED HER IN HER NEED
THEY HAD NOT RIDDEN FAR UPON THEIR ROAD WHEN THEY MET A CERTAIN SQUIRE OF THE LADY'S HOUSEHOLD ON HIS WAY TO BRITTANY BEARING LETTERS TO MILON HIS TASK WAS DONE LONG BEFORE SUNDOWN IN CHANCING ON THE KNIGHT
WHETHER IT BE A BOY OR GIRL HIS MOTHER WILL HAVE SUFFERED MUCH BECAUSE OF HIM AND FOR HER SISTER'S SAKE YOU WILL PRAY HER TO CHERISH THE BABE
MILON COMMENDED THE CHILD TO HIS MEN CHARGING THEM TO CARRY HIM LOYALLY BY SUCH TOWNS AS THEY KNEW TO THAT LADY BEYOND THE HUMBER THE SERVITORS SET FORTH BEARING THE INFANT WITH THEM
ALAS SAID THE LADY WHAT SHALL I DO I DOUBT THAT I AM LOST FOR MY LORD WILL FIND THAT HIS BRIDE IS NOT A MAID IF THIS BECOMES KNOWN THEY WILL MAKE ME A BONDWOMAN FOR ALL MY DAYS
THIS BEING ACCORDED BETWEEN THEM ON THE MORROW THEY MADE THEM READY FOR THE JOURNEY AND BIDDING FAREWELL TO THEIR FRIENDS SET FORTH FOR WALES THEY EMBARKED IN A PROPITIOUS HOUR FOR A FAIR WIND CARRIED THE SHIP RIGHT SWIFTLY TO ITS HAVEN
THEY MADE SUCH SPEED THAT AT THE END THEY CAME TO THE CASTLE WHERE THE LADY HAD HER LODGING LIGHT OF HEART WAS SHE WHEN SHE CLASPED AGAIN HER CHILD THESE TWO FOND LOVERS SOUGHT NEITHER COUNTENANCE OF THEIR KIN NOR COUNSEL OF ANY MAN
HE GAVE OVER THE SEALED WRITING WITH WHICH HE WAS CHARGED PRAYING THE KNIGHT TO HASTEN TO HIS FRIEND WITHOUT ANY TARRYING SINCE HER HUSBAND WAS IN HIS GRAVE MILON REJOICED GREATLY WHEN HE KNEW THIS THING HE SHOWED THE MESSAGE TO HIS SON AND PRESSED FORWARD WITHOUT PAUSE OR REST
AFTER THIS WAS ENDED HE WOULD SEEK HIS SON OF WHOM HE HAD HEARD NOTHING SINCE HE HAD GONE FROM HIS AUNT'S CASTLE MILON CAUSED HIS FRIEND TO KNOW OF HIS WISHES HE OPENED OUT TO HER ALL HIS THOUGHT AND CRAVED HER PERMISSION TO DEPART
IN RETURN HIS SPEAR WAS AIMED WITH SUCH CUNNING THAT HE BORE HIS ANTAGONIST TO THE GROUND MILON LAY UPON THE EARTH BAREHEADED FOR HIS HELMET WAS UNLACED IN THE SHOCK
WHAT HE TOOK FROM THE RICH HE BESTOWED ON SUCH KNIGHTS AS WERE POOR AND LUCKLESS THESE LOVED HIM GREATLY SINCE HE GAINED LARGELY AND SPENT FREELY GRANTING OF HIS WEALTH TO ALL WHEREVER THIS KNIGHT SOJOURNED IN THE REALM HE BORE AWAY THE PRIZE
THE BLOOD PRICKED IN HER VEINS FOR WELL SHE KNEW THAT THE WRITING WAS SENT HER BY HER FRIEND SHE CAUSED THE FOWLER TO BE GIVEN OF HER BOUNTY AND BADE THE MEN TO GO FORTH FROM HER CHAMBER WHEN THEY HAD PARTED THE LADY CALLED A MAIDEN TO HER AID
HE DETERMINED THEREFORE THAT HE WOULD LEAVE HIS COUNTRY AND SEEK ADVENTURE AS A KNIGHT ERRANT BEYOND THE SEA THE VARLET DELAYED NO LONGER THAN THE EVENING ON THE MORROW HE BADE FAREWELL TO HIS AUNT
THIS LETTER HE SENT BY THE SWAN COMMENDING THE BIRD TO HER CARE WHEN THE LADY HEARD OF HER LOVER'S PURPOSE SHE THANKED HIM FOR HIS COURTESY FOR GREATLY WAS HIS COUNSEL TO HER MIND SHE APPROVED HIS DESIRE TO QUIT THE REALM FOR THE SAKE OF HIS HONOUR
FOR SUCH WAS THE USAGE OF OUR FATHERS IN THE DAYS OF THIS TALE MILON GRIEVED SORELY AND MADE ANSWER THAT HE WOULD DO THE THING THE DAMSEL THOUGHT MOST SEEMLY TO BE DONE WHEN THE CHILD IS BORN REPLIED THE LADY
HE WOULD OF A SURETY FLY BACK TO THE PLACE FROM WHENCE HE CAME WITH ANY MESSAGE THAT THE LADY MIGHT LACE ABOUT HIS NECK
THE SWAN IS FIT TO SERVE AT A ROYAL TABLE FOR THE BIRD IS PLUMP AS HE IS FAIR THE VARLET PUT THE SWAN IN HIS LADY'S HANDS SHE TOOK THE BIRD KINDLY AND SMOOTHING HIS HEAD AND NECK FELT THE LETTER THAT WAS HIDDEN BENEATH ITS FEATHERS
IF YOU COME WITH ME I WILL BRING YOU WHERE I MAY KNOW WHETHER IT PLEASES MY LADY TO HAVE SPEECH WITH YOU AND TO RECEIVE YOUR GIFT THE PORTER ENTERED IN THE HALL WHERE HE FOUND NONE BUT TWO LORDS SEATED AT A GREAT TABLE PLAYING CHESS FOR THEIR DELIGHT
THEY RODE TO THEIR HOSTEL AND WITH THE KNIGHTS OF THEIR FELLOWSHIP PASSED THE HOURS IN MIRTH AND REVELRY MILON SPOKE TO THE LAD OF HIS MOTHER
CONTEMNERS OF LOVE WHO DELIGHT THEMSELVES IN SADNESS BUT ENDURE IT I MUST FOR ALAS I KNOW NOT HOW TO DIE SO ON THE APPOINTED DAY THE LADY WAS WEDDED TO THE BARON
AND HE MIGHT FIND HIMSELF OPPOSED EITHER BY HIS COMRADE OR HIS ENEMY MILON DID WELL AND WORSHIPFULLY IN THE PRESS AND WAS PRAISED OF MANY THAT DAY BUT THE KNIGHT PEERLESS CARRIED THE CRY FROM ALL HIS FELLOWS FOR NONE MIGHT STAND BEFORE HIM NOR RIVAL HIM IN SKILL AND ADDRESS
THE SQUIRE DID ACCORDING TO HIS LORD'S COMMANDMENT HE MADE HIM READY QUICKLY AND WENT FORTH BEARING THE SWAN WITH HIM HE WENT BY THE NEAREST ROAD AND PASSING THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY CAME BEFORE THE PORTAL OF THE CASTLE
BEYOND THIS I SHALL SET YOUR SIGNET BY A LACE ABOUT HIS NECK AND WRITE LETTERS WHEREIN SHALL BE MADE PLAIN THE NAME OF HIS SIRE AND THE SAD STORY OF HIS MOTHER
HE INQUIRED DILIGENTLY OF THE YOUNG CHAMPION AND ALL MEN WERE READY TO TELL FROM WHENCE HE CAME AND OF HIS HARNESS AND OF THE BLAZON ON HIS SHIELD AT LENGTH THE KNIGHT APPEARED IN THE LISTS AND MILON LOOKED UPON THE ADVERSARY HE SO GREATLY DESIRED TO SEE
COMMANDING HIM TO KEEP IT SAFELY AND TO SEE THAT IT ATE ENOUGH AND TO SPARE LADY SAID THE SERVITOR I WILL DO YOUR BIDDING WE SHALL NEVER RECEIVE FROM ANY FOWLER ON EARTH SUCH ANOTHER BIRD AS THIS
FAIR FRIEND BY MY FAITH THOU ART MY VERY SON FOR WHOM I CAME FORTH FROM MY OWN LAND AND HAVE SOUGHT THROUGH ALL THIS REALM THE VARLET CLIMBED FROM THE SADDLE AND STOOD UPON HIS FEET FATHER AND SON KISSED EACH OTHER TENDERLY WITH MANY COMFORTABLE WORDS
SHE SENT HIM A MESSAGE BY A SURE HAND SAYING THAT IF HER LOVE WAS TO HIS MIND SWEETLY WOULD IT BE TO HER HEART MILON REJOICED GREATLY WHEN HE KNEW THIS THING HE THANKED THE LADY FOR HER WORDS GIVING HER LOVE AGAIN IN RETURN FOR HER OWN
HIS HAIR AND BEARD SHOWED WHITE TO ALL AND THE VARLET WAS HEAVY TO LOOK ON HIM WHOM HE HAD OVERTHROWN HE CAUGHT THE DESTRIER BY THE BRIDLE AND LED HIM BEFORE THE STRICKEN MAN SIR SAID HE I PRAY YOU TO GET UPON YOUR HORSE
THAT BY REASON OF HIS PROWESS HIS LIBERALITY AND HIS MODESTY MEN CALLED HIM THE KNIGHT PEERLESS SINCE THEY DID NOT KNOW HIS NAME THIS PRAISE OF THE GOOD KNIGHT AND OF HIS DEEDS CAME TO BE HEARD OF MILON
THAT HE WOULD CROSS THE SEA WITHOUT DELAY SO THAT HE MIGHT JOUST WITH THE DANSELLON AND ABATE HIS PRIDE IN WRATH AND ANGER HE PURPOSED TO FIGHT TO BEAT HIS ADVERSARY FROM THE SADDLE AND BRING HIM AT LAST TO SHAME
SEVEN TIMES A DAY THEY REPOSED THEM IN THEIR JOURNEY SO THAT THE WOMEN MIGHT NOURISH THE BABE AND BATHE AND TEND HIM DULY THEY SERVED THEIR LORD SO FAITHFULLY KEEPING SUCH WATCH UPON THE WAY THAT AT THE LAST THEY WON TO THE LADY TO WHOM THEY WERE BIDDEN
A PILLOW OF FEATHERS WAS PUT BENEATH HIS HEAD AND OVER ALL WAS LAID A WARM COVERLET WADDED WITH FUR IN THIS FASHION THE ANCIENT NURSE GAVE THE BABE TO HIS FATHER WHO AWAITED HIM WITHIN THE GARDEN
I WILL GO TO HER THE MESSENGER BADE FAREWELL AND RETURNED TO HIS LADY HE PLACED THE RING IN HER HAND SAYING THAT HE HAD DONE HER WILL AS HE WAS BIDDEN TO DO RIGHT JOYOUS WAS THE DAMSEL TO KNOW THAT MILON'S LOVE WAS TENDER AS HER OWN
WHO HAVING WARNED AND ADMONISHED HIM FOR HIS GOOD GAVE HIM LARGELY OF HER WEALTH TO BRING HIM ON HIS WAY HE RODE TO SOUTHAMPTON THAT HE MIGHT FIND A SHIP EQUIPPED FOR SEA AND SO CAME TO BARFLEUR WITHOUT ANY TARRYING THE LAD WENT STRAIGHT TO BRITTANY
SHE REQUIRED HER FRIEND TO COME FOR SPEECH WITHIN THE PRIVATE GARDEN OF HER HOUSE WHERE SHE WAS WONT TO TAKE HER DELIGHT MILON CAME AT HER COMMANDMENT HE CAME SO OFTEN AND SO DEARLY SHE LOVED HIM THAT IN THE END SHE GAVE HIM ALL THAT MAID MAY GIVE
NEVERTHELESS BY REASON OF HIS SKILL WITH THE SPEAR HE WAS COUNTED A VERY WORSHIPFUL KNIGHT AND WAS HONOURABLY ENTREATED BY MANY A PRINCE IN DIVERS LANDS IN MILON'S OWN REALM THERE LIVED A LORD WHOSE NAME HAS GONE FROM MIND
THERE HE SOUGHT THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE LORDS OF THAT REALM AND FARED TO ALL THE TOURNAMENTS OF WHICH HE MIGHT HEAR MILON BORE HIMSELF PROUDLY AND GAVE GRACIOUSLY OF HIS WEALTH AS THOUGH HE WERE RECEIVING A GIFT
HE SOJOURNED TILL THE WINTER WAS PAST IN THAT LAND HE AND A BRAVE COMPANY OF KNIGHTS WHOM HE HELD IN HIS HOUSE WITH HIM WHEN EASTER HAD COME AND THE SEASON THAT MEN GIVE TO TOURNEYS AND WARS AND THE RIGHTING OF THEIR PRIVATE WRONGS
YOU MUST CARRY HIM FORTHWITH TO MY SISTER SHE IS A RICH DAME PITIFUL AND GOOD AND IS WEDDED TO A LORD OF NORTHUMBERLAND YOU WILL SEND MESSAGES WITH THE BABE BOTH IN WRITING AND BY SPEECH THAT THE LITTLE INNOCENT IS HER SISTER'S CHILD
VERY DOLENT WAS HE AND SORELY TROUBLED THAT SO YOUNG A KNIGHT SHOULD BE ESTEEMED ABOVE HIS FATHERS HE MARVELLED GREATLY THAT THE STOUT SPEARS OF THE PAST HAD NOT PUT ON THEIR HARNESS AND BROKEN A LANCE FOR THEIR ANCIENT HONOUR ONE THING HE DETERMINED
THE LAY OF MILON HE WHO WOULD TELL DIVERS TALES MUST KNOW HOW TO VARY THE TUNE TO WIN THE FAVOUR OF ANY HE MUST SPEAK TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF ALL I PURPOSE IN THIS PLACE TO SHOW YOU THE STORY OF MILON
SHE HELD HIM FOR A MONTH WITHIN HER CHAMBER BUT THIS WAS LESS FROM CHOICE THAN FOR THE CRAFT THAT WAS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THE INK AND PARCHMENT REQUISITE FOR HER WRITING AT THE END SHE WROTE A LETTER ACCORDING TO HER HEART AND SEALED IT WITH HER RING
WHEN HE SHALL HAVE GROWN TALL AND OF AN AGE TO UNDERSTAND THESE MATTERS HIS AUNT WILL GIVE HIM YOUR RING AND REHEARSE TO HIM THE LETTER IF THIS BE DONE PERCHANCE THE ORPHAN WILL NOT BE FATHERLESS ALL HIS DAYS
AND HER HUSBAND TOOK HER TO DWELL WITH HIM IN HIS FIEF WHEN MILON RETURNED TO HIS OWN COUNTRY HE WAS RIGHT HEAVY AND SORROWFUL TO LEARN OF THIS MARRIAGE HE LAMENTED HIS WRETCHED CASE BUT IN THIS HE FOUND COMFORT
MILON COMMENCED TO THINK WITHIN HIMSELF HOW BEST HE MIGHT SEND LETTERS TO THE DAMSEL THAT HE WAS COME AGAIN TO HIS HOME YET SO THAT NONE SHOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE THEREOF HE WROTE A LETTER AND SEALED IT WITH HIS SEAL
HE SWIFTLY RETURNED ON HIS STEPS AND THE FOWLER WITH HIM SO FURTIVELY WITHAL THAT THE LORDS WERE NOT DISTURBED AT THEIR GAME NOR PERCEIVED AUGHT OF THE MATTER THEY WENT THEREFORE TO THE CHAMBER OF THE LADY
AND FAR FROM PUTTING LET AND HINDRANCE IN HIS PATH TRUSTED THAT IN THE END HE WOULD BRING AGAIN HER SON SINCE MILON WAS ASSURED OF HIS FRIEND'S GOODWILL HE ARRAYED HIMSELF RICHLY AND CROSSING THE SEA TO NORMANDY CAME AFTERWARDS INTO THE LAND OF THE BRETONS
CHANGE THY RAIMENT SWIFTLY SAID HE AND HASTEN TO THE CASTLE OF MY FRIEND TAKE WITH THEE MY SWAN AND SEE THAT NONE NEITHER SERVANT NOR HANDMAID DELIVERS THE BIRD TO MY LADY SAVE THYSELF ALONE
BUT MUST LOVE ME AS A SON AND EVER HOLD ME DEAR WHEN MILON HEARD THESE WORDS HE COULD ENDURE THEM NO FURTHER HE GOT HIM SWIFTLY FROM HIS HORSE AND TAKING THE LAD BY THE FRINGE OF HIS HAUBERK HE CRIED PRAISE BE TO GOD FOR NOW AM I HEALED
SWEET TO HIS HEART WAS THE WRITING FOR THE LADY WROTE THAT WITHOUT HIM THERE WAS NO JOY IN HER LIFE AND SINCE IT WAS HIS DESIRE TO HEAR BY THE SWAN IT WOULD BE HER PLEASURE ALSO FOR TWENTY YEARS THE SWAN WAS MADE THE MESSENGER OF THESE TWO LOVERS
NOW IN THIS TOURNAMENT A KNIGHT COULD JOUST WITH THAT LORD WHO WAS SET OVER AGAINST HIM OR HE COULD SEEK TO BREAK A LANCE WITH HIS CHOSEN FOE
WHEN HE WAS COME TO A FITTING AGE SHE MADE HIM TO BE KNIGHTED OF HER LORD FOR GOODLY AND SERVICEABLE WAS THE LAD ON THE SAME DAY THE AUNT READ OVER TO HIM THE LETTER AND PUT IN HIS HAND THE RING
THIS MESSAGE HE MADE FAST TO THE NECK AND HID WITHIN THE PLUMAGE OF A SWAN THAT WAS LONG HIS AND WAS GREATLY TO HIS HEART HE BADE HIS SQUIRE TO COME AND MADE HIM HIS MESSENGER
IN ANSWER TO HIS SUMMONS THE PORTER DREW NEAR FRIEND SAID HE HEARKEN TO ME I AM OF CAERLEON AND A FOWLER BY CRAFT WITHIN MY NETS I HAVE SNARED THE MOST MARVELLOUS SWAN IN THE WORLD
MILON OBSERVED HIM CURIOUSLY THE LAD STRUCK SO HEAVILY HE THRUST HOME SO SHREWDLY THAT MILON'S HATRED CHANGED TO ENVY AS HE WATCHED VERY COMELY SHOWED THE VARLET AND MUCH TO MILON'S MIND
AND SINCE FEW WORDS ARE BEST I WILL SET OUT THE ADVENTURE AS BRIEFLY AS I MAY MILON WAS BORN IN SOUTH WALES
OF YOUR CHARITY I PRAY YOU THAT I MAY HAVE SPEECH WITH MY FRIEND IN SUCH A FASHION THAT NONE SHALL KNOW OF OUR MEETING CARRY HER THIS MY GOLDEN RING TELL HER ON MY PART THAT SO SHE PLEASES SHE SHALL COME TO ME OR IF IT BE HER BETTER PLEASURE
THE LADY CAUSED THE SWAN TO FAST FOR THREE FULL DAYS THEN HAVING CONCEALED THE MESSAGE ABOUT HIS NECK LET HIM TAKE HIS FLIGHT THE BIRD WAS ALL ANHUNGERED FOR FOOD AND REMEMBERING WELL THE HOME FROM WHICH HE DREW HE RETURNED THITHER AS QUICKLY AS HIS WINGS MIGHT BEAR HIM
STRIVE TO FIND A PLAN BY WHICH WE MAY SPEAK AS FRIEND TO FRIEND IF YOU WOULD HAVE ME LIVE THE KNIGHT PRAYED HER IN HIS LETTER TO SEND HIM AN ANSWER BY MEANS OF THE SWAN IF THE BIRD WERE WELL GUARDED AND KEPT WITHOUT PROVAND FOR THREE DAYS
AN OLD AUNT WAS AT THE COSTS OF MY NOURISHING SHE KEPT ME AT HER SIDE TILL OF ALL HER GIFTS SHE GAVE ME HORSE AND ARMS AND SENT ME HERE WHERE I HAVE REMAINED IN HOPE AND WISH I PURPOSE TO CROSS THE SEA AND RETURN TO MY OWN REALM
THEIR LOVE WAS FAIR TO SEE AND THOSE WHO LOOKED UPON THEIR MEETING WEPT FOR JOY AND PITY MILON AND HIS SON DEPARTED FROM THE TOURNAMENT SO SOON AS IT CAME TO AN END FOR THE KNIGHT DESIRED GREATLY TO SPEAK TO THE VARLET AT LEISURE AND TO OPEN BEFORE HIM ALL HIS MIND
SHE TOLD HIM THE NAME OF HIS MOTHER AND HIS FATHER'S STORY IN ALL THE WORLD THERE WAS NO WORTHIER KNIGHT NOR A MORE CHIVALROUS AND GALLANT GENTLEMAN THE LAD HEARKENED DILIGENTLY TO THE LADY'S TALE
HE KNEW AGAIN HIS TOWN AND HIS MASTER'S HOUSE AND DESCENDED TO THE GROUND AT MILON'S VERY FEET MILON REJOICED GREATLY WHEN HE MARKED HIS OWN HE CAUGHT THE BIRD BY HIS WINGS AND CRYING FOR HIS STEWARD BADE HIM GIVE THE SWAN TO EAT
I AM RIGHT GRIEVED AND VEXED THAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS WRONG BELIEVE ME THAT IT WAS WROUGHT UNWITTINGLY MILON SPRANG UPON HIS STEED HE APPROVED THE COURTESY OF HIS ADVERSARY AND LOOKING UPON THE HAND THAT HELD HIS BRIDLE HE KNEW AGAIN HIS RING
MANY A TIME THE SWAN WENT UPON HIS JOURNEY FOR HOWEVER STRICTLY THE LADY WAS HELD OF HER HUSBAND THERE WAS NONE WHO HAD SUSPICION OF A BIRD THE DAME BEYOND THE HUMBER NOURISHED AND TENDED THE BOY COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE WITH THE GREATEST CARE
SO DEBONAIR WAS HE AND CHIVALROUS THAT HIS FAME AND PRAISE CROSSED THE WATER AND WERE NOISED ABROAD IN HIS OWN LAND FOLK TOLD HOW A CERTAIN KNIGHT FROM BEYOND THE HUMBER WHO HAD PASSED THE SEA IN QUEST OF WEALTH AND HONOUR HAD SO DONE
SHE LACED THE RING ABOUT HIS NECK AND SET THE LETTER THAT IT WERE DEATH TO FIND WITHIN A SILKEN CHATELAINE THE CHILD WAS THEN PLACED IN HIS CRADLE SWATHED CLOSE IN WHITE LINEN
THE OLDER KNIGHT SET HIMSELF OVER AGAINST THE CHAMPION AND THEY MET TOGETHER IN THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD MILON STRUCK HIS ADVERSARY SO FIERCELY THAT THE LANCE SPLINTERED IN HIS GAUNTLET BUT THE YOUNG KNIGHT KEPT HIS SEAT WITHOUT EVEN LOSING A STIRRUP
MILON APPROVED THE COUNSEL OF THE LADY AND WHEN HER TIME HAD COME SHE WAS BROUGHT TO BED OF A BOY THE OLD NURSE WHO TENDED HER MISTRESS WAS PRIVY TO THE DAMSEL'S INMOST MIND
MEN PRAISED HIS NAME IN WHATEVER REALM THEY TALKED OF GALLANT DEEDS IRELAND NORWAY AND WALES YEA FROM JUTLAND EVEN TO ALBANIA SINCE HE WAS PRAISED BY THE FRANK HE WAS THEREFORE ENVIED OF THE MEAN
THE SON MADE ANSWER IN FAITH FAIR FATHER LET US RETURN TO OUR OWN LAND THERE I WILL SLAY THIS HUSBAND AND YOU SHALL YET BE MY MOTHER'S LORD
HE REJOICED GREATLY TO HEAR OF HIS FATHER'S PROWESS AND WAS PROUD BEYOND MEASURE OF HIS RENOWN HE CONSIDERED WITHIN HIMSELF SAYING TO HIS OWN HEART THAT MUCH SHOULD BE REQUIRED OF HIS FATHER'S SON AND THAT HE WOULD NOT BE WORTHY OF HIS BLOOD IF HE DID NOT ENDEAVOUR TO MERIT HIS NAME
THIS WONDROUS BIRD I WOULD BESTOW FORTHWITH UPON YOUR LADY BUT PERFORCE I MUST OFFER HER THE GIFT WITH MY OWN HAND FRIEND REPLIED THE PORTER FOWLERS ARE NOT ALWAYS WELCOMED OF LADIES
WHERE HE SPENT HIS MONEY AND HIMSELF IN FEASTS AND IN TOURNEYS THE RICH MEN OF THE LAND WERE GLAD OF HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR THERE WAS NONE WHO BORE HIMSELF BETTER IN THE PRESS WITH SPEAR OR WITH SWORD
SHE BROKE THE SEAL AND UNFASTENING THE LETTER CAME UPON THE NAME OF MILON AT THE HEAD SHE KISSED THE NAME A HUNDRED TIMES THROUGH HER TEARS WHEN SHE MIGHT READ THE WRITING SHE LEARNED OF THE GREAT PAIN AND DOLOUR THAT HER LOVER SUFFERED BY DAY AND BY NIGHT
IN ANSWER TO THEIR CALL THE DOOR WAS OPENED TO THEM BY A MAIDEN WHO LED THEM BEFORE HER DAME WHEN THE SWAN WAS PROFFERED TO THE LADY IT PLEASED HER TO RECEIVE THE GIFT SHE SUMMONED A VARLET OF HER HOUSEHOLD AND GAVE THE BIRD TO HIS CHARGE
I KNOW LITTLE OF MY FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT HIS NAME IS MILON AND THAT HE WAS A KNIGHT OF WALES HE LOVED THE DAUGHTER OF A RICH MAN AND WAS LOVED AGAIN MY MOTHER BORE ME IN SECRET AND CAUSED ME TO BE CARRIED TO NORTHUMBERLAND WHERE I WAS TAUGHT AND TENDED
SO WARILY SHE WENT TO WORK SO CUNNING WAS SHE IN GLOSS AND CONCEALMENT THAT NONE WITHIN THE PALACE KNEW THAT THERE WAS AUGHT TO HIDE THE DAMSEL LOOKED UPON HER BOY AND SAW THAT HE WAS VERY FAIR
MILON WENT FORTH FROM HIS REALM TO SERVE BEYOND THE SEAS FOR GUERDON HIS FRIEND REMAINED WITHIN HER HOUSE AND WAS GRANTED BY HER FATHER IN MARRIAGE TO A RIGHT RICH BARON OF THAT COUNTRY
WOULD THAT MY FRIEND WERE HERE TO FREE ME FROM THIS COIL IT WERE GOOD FOR ME TO DIE RATHER THAN TO LIVE BUT BY NO MEANS CAN I ESCAPE FROM THEIR HANDS THEY HAVE SET WARDERS ABOUT ME MEN OLD AND YOUNG WHOM THEY CALL MY CHAMBERLAINS
WITH THIS BARON DWELT HIS DAUGHTER A PASSING FAIR AND GRACIOUS DAMSEL MUCH TALK HAD THIS MAIDEN HEARD OF MILON'S KNIGHTLY DEEDS SO THAT SHE BEGAN TO SET HER THOUGHTS UPON HIM BECAUSE OF THE GOOD MEN SPOKE OF HIM
THERE I WOULD SEEK OUT MY FATHER AND LEARN HOW IT STANDS BETWEEN HIM AND MY MOTHER
HE MADE INQUIRY OF THE LAD FRIEND SAID HE HEARKEN TO ME TELL ME NOW THE NAME OF THY SIRE HOW ART THOU CALLED WHO IS THY MOTHER I HAVE SEEN MUCH AND GONE TO AND FRO ABOUT THE WORLD
BEYOND THIS COURTEOUS ANSWER MILON BESTOWED ON THE MESSENGER COSTLY GIFTS AND MADE HIM PROMISES THAT WERE RICHER STILL FRIEND SAID HE
MILON CONSIDERED HOW HE COULD MEET WITH THE KNIGHT WHOM MEN CALLED PEERLESS AT THAT TIME A TOURNAMENT WAS PROCLAIMED TO BE HELD AT MONT SAINT MICHEL MANY A NORMAN AND BRETON RODE TO THE GAME
THEIR SON HANDSELLED THEM TOGETHER AND GAVE THE MOTHER TO HIS SIRE
THE LADY RECEIVED THEM COURTEOUSLY AS BECAME HER BREEDING SHE BROKE THE SEAL OF THE LETTER AND WHEN SHE WAS ASSURED OF WHAT WAS THEREIN MARVELLOUSLY SHE CHERISHED THE INFANT THESE HAVING BESTOWED THE BOY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR LORD'S COMMANDMENT RETURNED TO THEIR OWN LAND
SO GREAT WAS HIS PROWESS THAT FROM THE DAY HE WAS DUBBED KNIGHT THERE WAS NO CHAMPION WHO COULD STAND BEFORE HIM IN THE LISTS HE WAS A PASSING FAIR KNIGHT OPEN AND BRAVE COURTEOUS TO HIS FRIENDS AND STERN TO HIS FOES
AT THE FAIRVIEW OPERA HOUSE ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO DEBATE THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ADVERTISING SIGNS BROUGHT GOOD OR EVIL TO THE COMMUNITY THE CAMPAIGN WAS NOW GETTING HOT
AND I HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHETHER THE HOUSE WAS STILL IN THEIR POSSESSION IT SEEMED TO BE UNTENANTED AT HIS MENTION OF KNOWING THE FAMILY JOYCE LOOKED HIM OVER WITH CONSIDERABLY MORE INTEREST HE WAS TALL STRAIGHT AND ROBUST
BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSING CANDIDATES EVERY VOTER IN THE DISTRICT HAD BECOME MORE OR LESS INTERESTED IN THE FIGHT AND PEOPLE WERE TAKING ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH UNUSUAL EARNESTNESS
THESE CANDLES EVERYTHING EVERYTHING JUST THE SAME AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY DID YOU OFTEN COME HERE INQUIRED JOYCE YOU MUST BE VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOUSE
THE TONES WERE UNBELIEVABLY JANGLING AND DISCORDANT YET JOYCE THOUGHT SHE CAUGHT THE NOTES OF A LITTLE TUNE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE BROKE INTO THE AIR SINGING SOFTLY THE OPENING LINE
OH ER I SEE THE FACT IS THE STRANGER WENT ON I WAS PASSING HERE AND NOTICED THIS OUTER DOOR OPEN WHICH SEEMED A LITTLE QUEER I USED TO KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE VERY WELL INDEED
THEN I LOCKED MYSELF IN MY ROOM TILL HE WAS GONE HE CAME SEVERAL TIMES KNOCKED AT MY DOOR AND BEGGED ME TO SEE HIM BUT I WOULD NOT
MISSUS COLLINGWOOD CAME CLOSER AND UTTERED A SUDDEN LOW CRY MY SON MOTHER THE TWO GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THIS SCENE WITH AMAZEMENT UNUTTERABLE
IN SPIRIT AND ONLY SOUTHERNERS I PLANNED THAT WHEN THEY WERE BOTH OLD ENOUGH THEY SHOULD MARRY IN THE SOUTH AND LIVE THERE AND MY HUSBAND AND I WITH THEM
HE PROPOSES TO DO KENNETH THEN TOOK THE PLATFORM AND WAS WELCOMED WITH A HEARTY CHEER HE MODESTLY ASSURED THEM THAT A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE COULD ACCOMPLISH MUCH GOOD FOR HIS DISTRICT
MY NAME IS CALTHORPE BUT I'M SURE THEY WOULDN'T REMEMBER ME AFTER ALL THIS TIME AND I DO NOT WISH TO TROUBLE THEM BUT JOYCE HAD EXCUSED HERSELF AND TURNED AWAY AS SOON AS SHE HEARD THE NAME LEAVING HIM STANDING THERE
SO WE GAVE THEM AN OBJECT LESSON WE PAINTED OUT ALL THE SIGNS IN THIS SECTION AT OUR OWN EXPENSE THAT YOU MIGHT SEE HOW MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL YOUR HOMES ARE WITHOUT THEM
SO UNEXPECTED WAS THE SOUND THAT THEY COULD ONLY STARE AT EACH OTHER INQUIRINGLY WITHOUT STIRRING IN A MOMENT IT CAME AGAIN A THUMPING OF THE OLD KNOCKER ON THE FRONT INNER DOOR
MISTER HOPKINS WAS NOT GREATLY PLEASED THAT HIS CHALLENGE HAD BEEN ACCEPTED HE HAD IMAGINED THAT THE FORBES PARTY WOULD IGNORE IT AND LEAVE HIM THE PRESTIGE OF CROWING OVER HIS OPPONENT'S TIMIDITY
TO EVERY OTHER EARTHLY CONSIDERATION AND DURING THAT INTERVIEW WELL NEED I SAY IT FAIRFAX WAS SIMPLY IMMOVABLE GENTLE AND LOVING ALWAYS
DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO GO UP ASKED CYNTHIA ANXIOUSLY PERHAPS SHE NEEDS HELP NO I THINK SHE JUST WANTS TO BE BY HERSELF IT WAS FINE OF YOU CYNTHIA TO SEND HER UP ALONE
MIGHT I PERHAPS IF IT WOULD NOT BE INTRUDING COME IN JUST A MOMENT TO LOOK ONCE MORE AT THE OLD PLACE THAT IS HE ADDED HASTILY SEEING HER HESITATE ONLY IF IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY CONVENIENT
UNTIL ADVERTISERS ARE FORCED TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES AND CIRCULARS THEIR ONLY LEGITIMATE CHANNELS THIS MUCH MISTER FORBES HAS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU AND HE WILL NOW TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IF HE IS ELECTED
THEY HAD CROWDED THEMSELVES INTO MORE PROMINENT PLACES UNTIL THE BARNS AND SHEDS AND THE VERY ROCKS WERE DAUBED WITH GLARING LETTERS ASKING US TO BUY THE MEDICINES SOAPS TOBACCOS AND OTHER WARES THE MANUFACTURERS WERE ANXIOUS TO SELL
STANDING SHIELDED BEHIND THE HALF CLOSED BLIND OF AN UPPER WINDOW AND LISTENING TO AS WELL AS WATCHING THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW THE GIRL HAD BEEN LAUGHING AND TALKING WITH MISTER HOPKINS WHEN SHE FIRST SAW HER
THE SILENT ATTENTION OF HER HEARERS PERMITTED HER TO BE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD SHE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS CAMPAIGN WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROMISED MORE BEAUTIFUL AND ATTRACTIVE HOUSES FOR THE FARMERS AND TOWNSMEN ALIKE
HE HAD SUNG NO MORE WHEN THE FACE OF MISSUS COLLINGWOOD APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY HER EYES WERE WIDE AND STARING HER FEATURES ALMOST GRAY IN COLOR
YET HOW WAS SHE TO COMPLY WITH IT CONSIDERING THE PRESENCE OF MISSUS COLLINGWOOD AND THE ALMOST UNEXPLAINABLE POSITION OF HERSELF AND CYNTHIA WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF IT ALL WHILE SHE WAS HESITATING AN IDEA CAME TO HER
TO SETTLE THIS ARGUMENT IN JOINT DEBATE THE GIRLS ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE AT ONCE WITHIN TWO DAYS EVERY FARMER HAD RECEIVED A NOTICE THAT MISTER FORBES WOULD MEET MISTER HOPKINS
AND THE CONFEDERACY WAS DECLARED I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CORRESPOND WITH SOUTHERN AUTHORITIES TO ARRANGE ABOUT RAISING A COMPANY FOR FAIRFAX I NEVER DOUBTED THAT HE WOULD COMPLY WITH MY WISHES BUT
WHEN MISTER FORBES BEGAN HIS CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE THE HOMESTEADS TO THEIR FORMER BEAUTY AND DIGNITY A CRY WAS RAISED AGAINST HIM BUT THIS WAS BECAUSE THE FARMERS DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS REFORM MEANT TO THEM
BUT IN THIS LIFE THINGS SELDOM TURN OUT AS WE PLAN MY LITTLE GIRL DIED BEFORE SHE WAS THREE AND I HAD SCARCELY BECOME RECONCILED TO THIS GRIEF
I LITTLE KNEW HIM I HARDLY NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE AWFUL DAY THAT HE CAME HOME YOU ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY OF IT THAT AFTERNOON SHORTLY AFTER HE ARRIVED
CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE BOOMERANG THE LAWN FETE WAS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND EVERY FARMER'S WIFE WAS PROUD OF HER SATIN BADGE BEARING THE MONOGRAM W P L AND THE WORDS
SHE TOOK CYNTHIA'S ARM WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY AND PARTLY CLOSED THE DOOR WHILE JOYCE WENT OUT TO ADMIT THE STRANGER IF YOU CARE TO LOOK AROUND THE DRAWING ROOM YOU WILL BE MOST WELCOME SHE ANNOUNCED POLITELY
THEY READ HOPKINS THE MAN OF THE TIMES IS THE CHAMPION OF THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES FORBES WHO NEVER EARNED A DOLLAR IN HIS LIFE BUT INHERITED HIS MONEY IS TRYING TO TAKE THE DOLLARS OUT OF THE POCKETS OF THE FARMERS
I'M SORRY SAID KENNETH THAT YOU GIRLS SHOULD BE FORCED TO ENDURE THIS I FEARED SOMETHING LIKE IT WHEN YOU INSISTED ON TAKING A HAND IN THE GAME BUT THEY LAUGHED AT HIM
THEY NEEDED MORE SCHOOL HOUSES FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH HE HOPED TO PROVIDE AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE DURING THIS ORATION BETH HAPPENED TO GLANCE UP AT THE HOUSE AND HER SHARP EYES DETECTED THE MAID ELIZA
AND THERE MAY BE A WAY TO CIRCUMVENT THIS UNSCRUPULOUS HOPKINS AND TURN THE INCIDENT TO OUR OWN ADVANTAGE LET'S THINK IT OVER CAREFULLY BEFORE WE ACT THERE'S ANOTHER THING SAID BETH SUPPORTING HER COUSIN
BUT I COULD NO MORE IMPRESS HIM WITH MY WISHES THAN I COULD HAVE MOVED THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR THE GALLING PART TO ME WAS THAT HE KEPT INSISTING HE WAS ONLY DOING WHAT WAS RIGHT RIGHT
CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE STRANGER AT THE DOOR MISSUS COLLINGWOOD REMAINED A LONG TIME UP STAIRS
INDEED THERE WERE MORE KINDLY THOUGHTS EXPRESSED FOR THE INHABITANTS OF ELMHURST THAN HAD EVER BEFORE BEEN HEARD IN A SINGLE DAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTY AND THE GREAT AND THE HUMBLE SEEMED MORE CLOSELY DRAWN TOGETHER
BUT HE REMEMBERED HOW EASILY HE HAD SUBDUED KENNETH AT THE SCHOOL HOUSE MEETING BEFORE THE NOMINATIONS AND HAD NO DOUBT OF HIS ABILITY TO REPEAT THE OPERATION HE WAS MUCH INCENSED AGAINST THE GIRLS WHO WERE WORKING FOR KENNETH FORBES
I WAS TOO HURRIED AND NERVOUS WHEN I CAME IN TO THINK OF IT THAT'S IT THEN SOME ONE HAS SEEN IT OPEN AND HAS STOPPED TO INQUIRE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT SHE HURRIED AWAY TO THE FRONT DOOR
AND AT MISTER HOPKINS AND DECLARED THEY WERE NOT AT ALL OFFENDED ONE CANNOT TOUCH PITCH WITHOUT BEING DEFILED SAID MISTER WATSON GRAVELY
THERE IS ONE OF THE FAMILY HERE TO DAY ON ON BUSINESS SHE SAID AT LAST IF YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR NAME I WILL ASK IF THAT PERSON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU OH THAT IS HARDLY WORTH WHILE
BUT NO MAN OF SENSE WILL PERMIT A WOMAN TO INFLUENCE HIS VOTE IT IS A DISGRACE TO THIS DISTRICT THAT MISTER FORBES ALLOWS HIS GIRLISH CAMPAIGN TO BE RUN BY A LOT OF MISSES WHO SHOULD BE AT HOME DARNING STOCKINGS OR IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT
AT LAST HOWEVER SHE CAME TO THEM AND SAT DOWN ONCE MORE BETWEEN THEM ON THE SOFA THEY WONDERED NERVOUSLY WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY MY LITTLE GIRLS SHE BEGAN FORGIVE ME
WHEN THE LAST GUEST HAD DEPARTED BETH GOT HER COUSINS AND KENNETH TOGETHER AND TOLD THEM OF HER DISCOVERY OF THE SPY KENNETH WAS AT FIRST GREATLY ANNOYED AND PROPOSED TO CALL MARTHA AND HAVE THE FALSE MAID EJECTED FROM THE PREMISES
WAS INSUFFICIENT TO COPE WITH SUCH A THRONG HE ALLOWED LOUISE TO IMPRESS SEVERAL FARMERS DAUGHTERS INTO SERVICE AND WAS ABLE TO FEED EVERYONE WITHOUT DELAY AND IN AN ABUNDANT AND SATISFACTORY MANNER
YES I CAME OFTEN I WAS ALMOST LIKE AN INMATE HE BEGAN TO WANDER SLOWLY ABOUT THE ROOM EXAMINING THE PICTURES IN FRONT OF THE BABY TWINS HE PAUSED A LONG TIME
THEREFORE THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS FOR REPRESENTATIVE THEN FOLLOWED AN ESTIMATE OF THE MONEY PAID THE FARMERS OF THE DISTRICT BY THE ADVERTISERS DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS
THE NEWSPAPERS HAVING BEEN SUBSIDIZED BY THE OPPOSITION SO EARLY IN THE GAME MISTER HOPKINS HAD DRIVEN TO EMPLOY THE CIRCULAR METHOD OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE VOTERS SCARCELY A DAY PASSED NOW THAT HIS CORPS OF DISTRIBUTORS
DID NOT LEAVE SOME OF HIS LITERATURE AT EVERY DWELLING IN THE DISTRICT HIS TIRADE AGAINST THE GIRLS WAS NEITHER CONVINCING NOR IN GOOD TASTE HE ASKED THE VOTERS IF THEY WERE WILLING TO SUBMIT TO PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT AND PERMIT A
BUT YOU LITTLE LADY SEEM QUITE INTIMATE WITH THE COLLINGWOOD FAMILY HISTORY TELL ME ARE YOU A A RELATIVE THIS CONFUSED JOYCE ANEW
FORBES FOR REPRESENTATIVE CERTAIN EDIBLES SUCH AS CHARLOTTE RUSSE SPANISH CREAM WINE JELLIES AND MOUSSES TO SAY NOTHING OF THE CAVIARS AND ANCHOVIES WERE WHOLLY UNKNOWN TO THEM
SHE DID NOT SPEAK TO THEM AT ONCE BUT WENT AND STOOD BY THE MANTEL LOOKING UP LONG AND EARNESTLY AT THE PORTRAIT OF THE TWINS MY BABIES THEY HEARD HER MURMUR UNCONSCIOUSLY ALOUD
BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN INFORM ME IS ANY ONE LIVING IN THIS HOUSE AT PRESENT WHY NO REPLIED JOYCE RATHER CONFUSEDLY THAT IS NO THE HOUSE IS EMPTY EXCEPT JUST JUST TO DAY
FOR HE REALIZED THAT THEY WERE PROVING AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CAMPAIGN HE EVEN ATTRIBUTED TO THEM MORE THAN THEY DESERVED FOR UNCLE JOHN'S TELLING ACTIVITIES WERE SO QUIETLY CONDUCTED
IF HE HONESTLY DESIRED TO DO SO THAT WAS WHAT A REPRESENTATIVE WAS FOR TO REPRESENT HIS PEOPLE IT WAS FOLLY TO ELECT ANY MAN WHO WOULD FORGET THAT DUTY AND PROMOTE ONLY HIS OWN INTERESTS THROUGH THE POSITION OF POWER TO WHICH THE PEOPLE HAD APPOINTED HIM
I DO NOT KNOW OF COURSE WHY THE HOUSE IS OPEN PERHAPS PEOPLE ARE ARE ABOUT TO PURCHASE IT JOYCE WAS FOR A MOMENT TONGUE TIED WITH PERPLEXITY SHE HATED TO REFUSE THE SIMPLE WISH OF THIS PLEASANT STRANGER
THEY HAVE MERELY GONE TO WORK IN A BUSINESS LIKE MANNER AND USED THEIR WITS AND COMMON SENSE IN EDUCATING THE VOTERS REALLY MY DEARS I'M MORE PROUD OF YOU TODAY THAN I'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE HE CONCLUDED
WE HAD OUR INTERVIEW I HAVE ALWAYS POSSESSED THE MOST VIOLENT TEMPER A MORTAL HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH AND IN THOSE EARLIER YEARS WHEN I GOT INTO A RAGE IT BLINDED ME TO EVERYTHING ELSE
BUT PATSY'S WISE LITTLE HEAD COUNSELLED CAUTION IN HANDLING THE MATTER NOW THAT WE KNOW HER SECRET SHE SAID THE GIRL CANNOT CAUSE US MORE REAL HARM
ONLY SEVENTEEN I WAS A SOUTHERNER BUT MY HUSBAND CAME FROM THE NORTH AND BROUGHT ME UP NORTH HERE TO LIVE I ALWAYS HATED IT THIS NORTHERN LIFE AND THOUGH I
AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN THE AGGREGATE THE CIRCULAR ENDED IN THIS WAY HOPKINS CHALLENGES FORBES TO DENY THESE FACTS HOPKINS IS WILLING TO MEET FORBES BEFORE THE PUBLIC AT ANY TIME AND PLACE HE MAY SELECT
IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE NEIGHBORING FARMERS AND THEY DROVE HOMEWARD IN THE LATE AFTERNOON FULL OF ENTHUSIASM OVER THE ROYAL MANNER IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ENTERTAINED AND ADMIRATION FOR THE GIRLS WHO HAD PROVIDED THE FUN AND FEASTING
I HAVE A WISH TO KEEP THIS GIRL AT THE HOUSE WHERE I CAN STUDY HER CHARACTER THEN KEEP HER MY DEAR DECIDED KENNETH I'LL SET A COUPLE OF MEN TO WATCH THE GATES AND IF SHE GOES OUT WE'LL KNOW WHOM SHE MEETS
THEN YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN YOUNG MISTER FAIRFAX VERY WELL SUGGESTED JOYCE THAT'S HE ON THE RIGHT IN THE PICTURE THE STRANGER EYED HER CURIOUSLY WHY YES I KNEW HIM WELL
AND HAD ALWAYS RESENTED OPPOSITION AND I FELT SURE THAT HE WOULD SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHEN HE WAS OLDER I WISHED TO SEND HIM TO A SOUTHERN COLLEGE BUT HE BEGGED ME TO SEND HIM TO HARVARD
BUT THEY ATE THE DAINTIES WITH A WISE DISREGARD OF THEIR INEXPERIENCE AND ENJOYED THEM IMMENSELY THE OLD BUTLER WAS A GENERAL IN HIS WAY AND IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE STAFF OF SERVANTS AT ELMHURST
AND MEET MISTER HOPKINS IN THE LANE THEY CONVERSED TOGETHER A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN THE MAID CALMLY RETURNED AND WENT TO HER ROOM THE NEXT DAY MISTER HOPKINS SCATTERED FLARING HAND BILLS OVER THE DISTRICT
HER FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO DENOUNCE THE MAID AT ONCE AND HAVE HER DISCHARGED BUT THE TIME WAS NOT OPPORTUNE SO SHE WAITED UNTIL THE FESTIVITIES WERE ENDED
I NOTICED THAT HE TALKED MORE AND MORE IN SYMPATHY WITH THE NORTH AND THIS DISTRESSED ME TERRIBLY HOWEVER I THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO SAY MUCH ABOUT IT TO HIM FOR HE WAS A HEADSTRONG BOY
HEAVEN FORGIVE ME I WOULD NOT SO HE MUST HAVE LEFT ME THAT NOTE SHE COVERED HER EYES WITH HER HAND A MOMENT THEN SHE WENT ON
LOT OF BOARDING SCHOOL GIRLS WITH MORE BOLDNESS THAN MODESTY TO DICTATE THE POLICIES OF THE COMMUNITY THESE FRIZZLE HEADED FEMALES CONTINUED THE CIRCULAR ARE TRYING TO MAKE YOUR WIVES AND DAUGHTERS AS REBELLIOUS AND UNREASONABLE AS THEY ARE THEMSELVES
AND RETURN TO THE SOUTH HE LEFT ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND WENT TO HIS ROOM I IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED THE SERVANTS AND DISMISSED THEM ON THE SPOT GIVING THEM ONLY TIME TO GET THEIR THINGS TOGETHER AND GO
MISTER FORBES ADMITTED THAT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE HE WAS OPPOSED TO OFFENSIVE ADVERTISING SIGNS BUT NOW HE HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN OTHER ISSUES AND WAS ANXIOUS TO BE ELECTED SO THAT HE COULD CARRY ON THE WORK OF REFORM
LOVED MY HUSBAND DEARLY I HATED HIS DEVOTION TO IT WE NEVER AGREED ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS WHEN MY TWIN BABIES WERE BORN I SECRETLY DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE SOUTHERNERS
AS MISTER HOPKINS KNOWS IT IS LITTLE MORE THAN PITCH I CANNOT SEE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING MY GIRLS HAVE DONE TO FORFEIT RESPECT AND ADMIRATION ASSERTED UNCLE JOHN STOUTLY TO ACCUSE THEM OF BOLDNESS OR IMMODESTY IS ABSURD
I'D LIKE TO STUDY HER A LITTLE IT WAS ABSURD TO CONNECT HER WITH LUCY ROGERS OBSERVED KENNETH FOR THERE IS NOTHING IN HER CHARACTER TO REMIND ONE OF THE UNHAPPY GIRL EXCEPT HER LOOKS ADDED BETH SHE'S THE LIVING IMAGE OF MISSUS ROGERS
BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THEM AN UNHAPPY FAMILY WAS HIS ONLY COMMENT AND HE CONTINUED HIS TOUR AROUND THE ROOM
IN FRONT OF THE OLD SQUARE OPEN PIANO HE PAUSED AGAIN AND FINGERED THE SILK SCARF THAT HAD AT SOME LONG AGO DATE BEEN THROWN CARELESSLY UPON IT THEN HE RAN HIS FINGERS LIGHTLY OVER THE YELLOW KEYS
HE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION GRATEFULLY AND ENTERED WITH HER AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOWEVER HE STARTED BACK SLIGHTLY AS WITH A SHOCK OF SURPRISE WHY HOW STRANGE HOW VERY SINGULAR HE MURMURED
AND AFTER AN EFFORT SUCCEEDED IN PULLING IT OPEN A MAN A COMPLETE STRANGER TO HER STOOD OUTSIDE THEY REGARDED EACH OTHER WITH MUTUAL SURPRISE PARDON ME HE SAID
EVERY COUNTRY ROAD BECAME AN ADVERTISING AVENUE SCARCELY A COUNTRY HOUSE WAS FREE FROM SIGNS OF SOME SORT YET THE PEOPLE TAMELY SUBMITTED TO THIS IMPOSITION BECAUSE THEY KNEW NO WAY TO AVOID IT
THOUGH RATHER VERGING ON THE ELDERLY HIS IRON GRAY HAIR WAS CRISPLY CURLY AND HIS DARK EYES TWINKLED OUT FROM UNDER BUSHY GRAY BROWS HIS SMILE WAS CAPTIVATING
I SUPPOSE YOU CONSIDER YOURSELVES ALMOST YOUNG LADIES BUT YOU SEE I AM AN OLD WOMAN I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT MY LIFE BUT I SUPPOSE YOU ALREADY KNOW MOST OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS
AS HIS HEART WAS SO SET ON IT I COULDN'T DENY HIM THINKING THAT EVEN THIS WOULD MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE END THEN CAME THE CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY'S AFFAIRS
I NEVER SAW OR KNEW OF IT TILL THIS DAY IF I HAD JUST AT THIS POINT THEY WERE ALL STARTLED BY A LOUD KNOCK COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE FRONT DOOR
HOW COULD HE BE RIGHT WHEN IT WAS ALL DIRECTLY CONTRARY BUT NEVER MIND THAT NOW I HAVE LEARNED DIFFERENTLY WITH THE PASSING SORROWFUL YEARS BUT TO GO BACK
JOYCE DECIDED AT ONCE THAT SHE LIKED HIM OH DID YOU KNOW THE FAMILY THE THE COLLINGWOODS HE SUPPLEMENTED WITH HIS TWINKLING SMILE YES I KNEW THEM QUITE INTIMATELY
IF I'M NOT MUCH MISTAKEN MISTER HOPKINS HAS THROWN A BOOMERANG EVERY WOMAN WHO ATTENDED THE FETE IS NOW LINKED WITH US AS AN ALLY AND EVERY ONE OF THEM WILL RESENT THIS FOOLISH CIRCULAR
I'M INTERESTED IN THE MYSTERY SURROUNDING THE GIRL I NOW THINK I WAS WRONG IN SUSPECTING HER TO BE THE LOST LUCY ROGERS BUT THERE IS SURELY SOME ROMANCE CONNECTED WITH HER AND SHE IS NOT WHAT SHE SEEMS TO BE
BY DEPRIVING THEM OF THE INCOME DERIVED BY SELLING SPACES FOR ADVERTISING SIGNS HE IS ROBBING THE FARMERS WHILE CLAIMING HE WANTS TO BEAUTIFY THEIR HOMES
ARTHUR CALTHORPE HE FALTERED NO YOU ARE NOT THEY DREW TOWARD EACH OTHER UNCONSCIOUSLY AS THOUGH MOVING IN A DREAM NO ONE
MISSUS COLLINGWOOD HOWEVER SHOOK HER HEAD WHEN JOYCE ANNOUNCED WHO WAS OUTSIDE I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY ONE NAMED CALTHORPE AND I SCARCELY FEEL THAT I CAN SEE A STRANGER NOW
WE HAD ALL GROWN SO ACCUSTOMED TO ADVERTISING SIGNS SHE SAID THAT WE FAILED TO NOTICE HOW THICK THEY WERE BECOMING OR HOW BOLD AND OVERPOWERING FROM A FEW SCATTERED ANNOUNCEMENTS ON FENCE BOARDS
WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS ALSO TAKEN FROM ME SO I CENTERED ALL MY HOPES ON MY SON ON FAIRFAX AS HE GREW OLDER HOWEVER AND AS THE CIVIL WAR CAME NEARER
THAT ISN'T IMPORTANT REPLIED LOUISE IT IS PROBABLY A MERE COINCIDENCE NONE OF US HAVE EVER SEEN THE REAL LUCY AND SHE MAY NOT RESEMBLE HER MOTHER AT ALL MISSUS ROGERS CLAIMS SHE DOES SAID BETH BUT ANYHOW
WE BELIEVE THAT NONE OF YOU WILL EVER CARE TO ALLOW ADVERTISING SIGNS ON YOUR PROPERTY AGAIN AND THAT THE QUIET REFINEMENT OF THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WILL INDUCE MANY OTHER PLACES TO FOLLOW OUR EXAMPLE
I STOOD IT AS LONG AS I COULD AND THEN I TURNED FROM HIM DISOWNED HIM BADE HIM LEAVE THE HOUSE AT ONCE AND NEVER SEE MY FACE AGAIN AND INFORMED HIM THAT I MYSELF WOULD ABANDON THE PLACE ON THE MORROW
THEN WITH A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE THE MAN HELD OUT HIS ARMS AND THE WOMAN WITH A LITTLE GASP OF HAPPINESS
I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE I'D HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AT LENGTH THEY HEARD HER COMING SLOWLY DOWN AND PRESENTLY SHE REENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM THEY COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS MUCH MOVED AND HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN CRYING
AFTER LUNCHEON BEGAN THE SPEECH MAKING INTERSPERSED WITH MUSIC BY THE BAND LOUISE MADE THE PRELIMINARY ADDRESS AND ALTHOUGH HER VOICE WAS NOT VERY STRONG
WHO WHO ARE YOU SHE DEMANDED IN A VOICE SCARCELY LOUDER THAN A WHISPER THE STRANGER GAZED AT HER WITH A FIXED LOOK ARTHUR
THE MOST SHE CAN DO IS TO REPORT OUR MOVEMENTS TO MISTER HOPKINS AND THERE'S NO GREAT HARM IN THAT SO THE MATTER WAS LEFT FOR THE TIME AND AS IF TO VERIFY BETH'S SUSPICIONS ELIZA WAS SEEN TO LEAVE THE GROUNDS AFTER DUSK
THAT HE WAS PERSONALLY LOST SIGHT OF ENTIRELY BY MISTER HOPKINS MISTER HOPKINS HAD THEREFORE BECOME SO ENRAGED THAT AGAINST THE ADVICE OF HIS FRIENDS HE ISSUED A CIRCULAR SNEERING AT WOMEN IN POLITICS
BUT WE MUST NOT BE INHOSPITABLE MISS CYNTHIA AND I WILL GO AND SIT IN THE LIBRARY AND YOU CAN BRING HIM INTO THE DRAWING ROOM A FEW MOMENTS THERE IS NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSE THAT CAN VERY WELL BE SHOWN
I GUESS I'D BETTER GO SAID JOYCE SOME ONE MAY HAVE SEEN THE LITTLE BOARDED UP DOOR OPEN DID YOU LEAVE IT OPEN SHE ASKED TURNING TO MISSUS COLLINGWOOD I THINK I DID
SHE PATTED JOYCE'S HAND THERE ARE SOME THINGS HOWEVER THAT PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW AND AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME YOU DESERVE TO I WAS MARRIED WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG GIRL
SO LONG INDEED THAT THE GIRLS BEGAN TO BE RATHER UNEASY FEARING THAT SHE HAD FAINTED OR PERHAPS WAS ILL OR OVERCOME
WHICH THE NAPOS NAME RESPECTIVELY
AND TO IMITATE OUR DISTANT FRIENDS WE SACRIFICED AN EXTRA MEAL FRICASSEED CHICKEN JERKED BEEF BOILED YUCAS BANANAS ORANGES LEMONADE AND GUAYUSA
STOOD NEAR OUR QUARTERS THE INDIANS WERE KEEPING ONE OF THEIR SEVEN FEASTS IN A HUT NEAR BY AND THEIR DRUMMING WAS THE LAST THING WE HEARD AS WE TURNED INTO OUR HAMMOCKS AND THE FIRST IN THE MORNING
THIS WAS NOT EASILY DONE THE INDIANS SEEMED RELUCTANT TO QUIT THEIR FEASTS AND GO ON SUCH A LONG VOYAGE
WE EMBARKED NOVEMBER TWENTIETH ON OUR VOYAGE DOWN THE RIVER IT IS NO EASY MATTER TO HIRE OR CAJOLE THE INDIANS FOR ANY SERVICE OUT OF FEAST TIME
THE INDIANS NEVER EAT THEM IN NO COUNTRY AS IN THE AMAZONIAN VALLEY IS THERE SUCH A VARIETY OF INSECTS NOWHERE DO WE FIND SPECIES OF LARGER SIZE OR GREATER BEAUTY
DARWIN SAYS THAT WE OUGHT NOT TO EXPECT ANY CLOSER SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE ORGANIC BEINGS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ANDES THAN ON THE OPPOSITE SHORES OF THE OCEAN WE WILL REMARK THAT WE OBTAINED A PECCARI
WE SET SAIL ARRIVING AT COCA AT TWO P M THIS LITTLE VILLAGE THE LAST WE SHALL SEE TILL WE COME WITHIN SIGHT OF THE AMAZON IS BEAUTIFULLY LOCATED ON THE RIGHT BANK TWENTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE RIVER
ADDS A LITTLE WATER AND DRINKS HIS CHICHA WITHOUT CEREMONY DURING LEISURE HOURS THE INDIANS BUSIED THEMSELVES PLAITING PALM LEAVES INTO ORNAMENTS FOR THEIR ARMS AND HEADS NOT A NOTE DID THEY WHISTLE OR SING
IS A QUARRELSOME IMPERIOUS BIRD IT IS CLUMSY IN FLIGHT BUT NIMBLE IN LEAPING FROM LIMB TO LIMB IT HOPS ON THE GROUND LIKE A ROBIN AND MAKES A SHRILL YELPING PIA PO O CO
WE ARRIVED AT NEW SANTA ROSA AND SWUNG OUR HAMMOCKS IN THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE SANTA ROSA ONCE THE PROSPEROUS CAPITAL OF THE PROVINCIA DEL ORIENTE NOW CONTAINS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THE VOICE OF THE LATTER SOUNDS LIKE THE CRACKING OF WOOD OCCASIONALLY FROGS OWLS AND GOAT SUCKERS CROAK HOOT AND WAIL BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND THREE A M ALMOST PERFECT SILENCE REIGNS
BUT IN ALL OUR INTERCOURSE WITH THESE WILD MEN
AND AN UP CURRENT ON THE OTHER NOW A CROSS STREAM AT THE BOWS AND A DIAGONAL ONE AT THE STERN WITH A FOAMING SCYLLA ON YOUR RIGHT AND A WHIRLING CHARYBDIS ON THE LEFT BUT OUR NERVOUSNESS GAVE WAY TO ADMIRATION
BUT AFTER RECEIVING THE COCA IT TURNS TO THE SOUTHEAST WE REMAINED HERE TWO DAYS TO CONSTRUCT A MORE COMFORTABLE CRAFT FOR OUR VOYAGE TO THE AMAZON A DISTANCE OF AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED MILES
AND PLANTED FOUR STOUT CHONTA STICKS TO SUPPORT A PALM THATCHED ROOF A RUDDER A NOVEL IDEA TO OUR RED SKINNED COMPANIONS AND A BOX OF SAND IN THE STERN OF ONE OF THE BOATS FOR A FIRE PLACE COMPLETED OUR RIG
THIS WAS THE ONLY CASE OF DISCIPLINE ON THE VOYAGE ALWAYS OBSEQUIOUS THEY OBEYED US WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING NONE OF THEM COULD SPEAK SPANISH SO WE HAD PROVIDED OURSELVES WITH A VOCABULARY
ARE MACAWS PARROTS TOUCANS AND CIGANAS THE PARROTS LIKE THE MAJORITY IN SOUTH AMERICA ARE OF THE GREEN TYPE THE TOUCAN PECULIAR TO THE NEW WORLD AND DISTINGUISHED BY ITS ENORMOUS BILL
AND OPPOSITE THE CONFLUENCE OF THE RIO COCA THOUGH FOUNDED TWENTY YEARS AGO IT CONTAINS ONLY FIVE OR SIX BAMBOO HUTS A GOVERNMENT HOUSE CHURCH ALCALDE'S RESIDENCE
THEY ARE OUT OF TOWN AND DURING THE FESTIVAL THEY ARE LOTH TO LEAVE OR ARE SO FULL OF CHICHA THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WANT
WHO SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME SWINGING IN A HAMMOCK SLUNG BETWEEN THE POSTS OF HIS VERANDA AND PLAYING WITH A TAME PARROT WHEN NOT DRUNK OR ASLEEP THIS SPOT IS MEMORABLE IN HISTORY
UPON PRESENTING THE GOVERNOR WITH A VEST HE IMMEDIATELY CUT OFF THE BUTTONS AND DIVIDING THE CLOTH INTO FOUR PARTS SHARED IT WITH HIS FELLOWS
WE HAD THREE STYLES OF VALEDICTION ON LEAVING OUR INDIAN QUARTET AFTER SEVERAL LAST DRINKS OF CHICHA BADE THEIR FRIENDS FAREWELL BY CLASPING HANDS ONE KISSING THE JOINED HANDS AND THEN THE OTHER
THE INDIANS SO ACCUSTOMED TO BRUTAL VIOLENCE FROM THE HANDS OF THE WHITES HAD BEGGED OF US BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE THAT WE WOULD NOT BEAT THEM BUT SHORTLY AFTER WE LEFT ONE OF THEM WHO WAS LITERALLY FILLED WITH CHICHA
ORANGE AND ROSE COLORS AND THE ROBES OF THE ROYAL DAMES OF EUROPE
THE SPLENDID METALLIC BLUE AND THE YELLOW AND TRANSPARENT WINGED ARE VERY ABUNDANT ON THE NAPO SOME RISE HIGH IN THE AIR OTHERS LIVING IN SOCIETIES LOOK LIKE FLUTTERING CLOUDS MOTHS ARE COMPARATIVELY RARE
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS BEETLE ON THE RIVER IS A MAGNIFICENT GREEN SPECIES CHRYSOPHORA CHRYSOCHLORA ALWAYS FOUND ARBOREAL LIKE THE MAJORITY OF TROPICAL COLEOPTERS THEY LOOK LIKE EMERALD GEMS CLINGING TO THE BRANCHES
WERE TRIMMED WITH THEM THE CIGANA OR GYPSY IN PERU CALLED CHANSU RESEMBLES A PHEASANT THE FLESH HAS A MUSKY ODOR AND IT IS FOR THIS REASON PERHAPS THAT THEY EXIST IN SUCH NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
THEY SHOUTED BUENO OUR TRUNKS AND PROVISION CANS WERE ARRANGED ALONG THE TWO SIDES OF THE PLATFORM SO THAT WE HAD ABUNDANCE OF FROM FOR EXERCISE BY DAY AND FOR SLEEPING UNDER MUSQUITO TENTS AT NIGHT A LITTLE CANOE
THE NAPO AT SANTA ROSA RUNS AT LEAST FIVE MILES AN HOUR AND WE WERE SOON PICKING OUR WAY NOW DRIFTING NOW PADDLING THROUGH A LABYRINTH OF ISLANDS AND SNAGS
THESE STORM CLOUDS MOVED RAPIDLY FOR IN HALF AN HOUR ALL WAS QUIET ON THE NAPO AT QUITO TWO HUNDRED MILES WEST THE USUAL AFTERNOON SHOWER OCCURS TWO HOURS LATER
BUT AN OCCASIONAL PUFF WOULD COME FROM THE NORTHWEST WHEN WE RELIEVED OUR PADDLERS BY HOISTING A BLANKET FOR A SAIL SIX O'CLOCK WAS OUR USUAL HOUR OF DEPARTURE AND TEN OR TWELVE HOURS OUR TRAVELING TIME ALWAYS TYING UP AT A PLAIA OR ISLAND
AT EARLY DAWN THE ANIMAL CREATION AWAKES WITH A SCREAM PRE EMINENT ARE THE DISCORDANT CRIES OF MONKEYS AND MACAWS AS THE SUN RISES HIGHER ONE MUSICIAN AFTER ANOTHER SEEKS THE FOREST SHADE
PARROTS AND MONKEYS RESUME THEIR CHATTER FOR A SEASON AND THEN GIVE WAY TO THE NOISELESS FLIGHT OF INNUMERABLE BATS CHASING THE HAWK MOTH AND BEETLE THERE IS SCARCELY A SOUND IN A TROPICAL FOREST WHICH IS JOYOUS AND CHEERING
AND SIRUP AND AT COCA WE TOOK IN THREE FOWLS A BAG OF RICE AND A BUNCH OF BANANAS SO WE FARED SUMPTUOUSLY EVERY DAY WE LEFT COCA ON THANKSGIVING DAY NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH
AND THEN DOWN FELL THE DELUGE THE INDIANS HAVE A SAYING THAT
YET THEY WERE ALWAYS IN GOOD HUMOR AND DURING THE WHOLE VOYAGE
OF WHICH THERE ARE HOSTS IN THE NAPO BUT NEVER TO THE MAIN LAND FOR FEAR OF UNFRIENDLY INDIANS AND THE STILL MORE UNWELCOME TIGER OUR CREW ENCAMPED AT A RESPECTFUL THOUGH HAILING DISTANCE ON THE SECOND DAY FROM COCA
BY SHOWING HIM THE PRESIDENT'S ORDER AND THEN USED HIM TO ENTICE OR TO COMPEL WE KNOW NOT HIS MOTIVE POWER EIGHT INDIANS INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR TO TAKE US TO SANTA ROSA WE PAID THEM ABOUT TWENTY FOUR YARDS OF LIENZO
BUT SOME ENGLISH WORDS LIKE THE IMPERATIVE PADDLE WERE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE TONGUE OF THE INCAS INDEED WHEN WE MIXED UP OUR QUICHUA WITH A LITTLE ANGLO SAXON THEY EVIDENTLY THOUGHT THE LATTER
WAS A TERRIBLE ANATHEMA FOR THEY SPRANG TO THEIR PLACES WITHOUT DELAY IN SEVEN HOURS WE ARRIVED AT SUNO A COLLECTION OF HALF A DOZEN PALM BOOTHS FIVE FEET HIGH THE MISERABLE OWNERS OF WHICH DO A LITTLE FISHING AND GOLD WASHING
AND THE MORNING CONCERT ENDS AT NOON IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY THERE IS AN ALL PERVADING RUSTLING SOUND CAUSED BY THE FLUTTERING OF MYRIAD INSECTS AND THE GLIDING OF LIZARDS AND SNAKES AT SUNSET
IT IS THE RICHEST LOCALITY FOR BUTTERFLIES BATES FOUND TWELVE HUNDRED SPECIES IN BRAZIL ALONE
FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF AGUARDIENTE AND SIRUP FROM THE CANE
TO CONFER WITH THE ALCALDE IN ONE CORNER STANDS A TABLE THE ONLY ONE WE REMEMBER SEEING ON THE NAPO ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE ARE HEAPED UP JARS POTS KETTLES HUNTING AND FISHING IMPLEMENTS PADDLES
ECUADORIANS CALL IT THE PREDICADOR OR PREACHER BECAUSE IT WAGS ITS HEAD LIKE A PRIEST AND SEEMS TO SAY GOD GAVE IT YOU
WE WERE CAUGHT IN A SQUALL AND TO SAVE OUR ROOF WE RAN ASHORE NEARLY EVERY AFTERNOON WE WERE TREATED TO A SHOWER ACCOMPANIED BY A STRONG WIND BUT SELDOM BY THUNDER AND LIGHTNING THOUGH AT COCA WE HAD A BRILLIANT THUNDER STORM AT NIGHT
AT NO TIME DID WE HAVE THE LEAST FEAR OF TREACHERY OR VIOLENCE THE NAPOS ARE NOT SAVAGES THEIR GOODNESS HOWEVER AS BATES SAYS OF THE CUCAMA TRIBE CONSISTS MORE IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVE BAD QUALITIES
AND AT SANTA ROSA WE WERE ALWAYS PRESENTED WITH A CUP OF GUAYUSA IN BRAZIL WITH A CUP OF COFFEE SANDOVAL WORE NOTHING BUT SHIRT AND PANTALOONS THE DIGNITY OF THE BAREFOOTED FUNCTIONARY
BOWS AND ARROWS BETWEEN THE POSTS SWING TWO CHAMBIRI HAMMOCKS FROM SANTA ROSA TO PARA THE HAMMOCK ANSWERS FOR CHAIR SOFA TETE A TETE AND BED WHEN A STRANGER ENTERS
SANDOVAL WAS ANOTHER MAN AND THE TWO CANOES AND FOUR INDIANS WE WANTED WERE FORTHCOMING WE HAD TO WAIT HOWEVER TWO DAYS FOR THE INDIANS TO PREPARE THEIR CHICHA FOR THE JOURNEY AND TO COVER THE CANOES WITH PALM AWNINGS
QUICK STROKES WERE GIVEN PERPENDICULARLY TO THE WATER ENTERING AND LEAVING BUT THERE WAS LITTLE NEED OF PADDLING ON THIS TRIP THE NAPO STARTS OFF IN FURIOUS HASTE FOR THE FALL BETWEEN NAPO VILLAGE AND SANTA ROSA
IN THE DEPTHS OF THE NAPO WILDERNESS STARTING ON A MONKEY CRUSADE BUT IT WAS STILL MORE STIRRING TO THINK OF PADDLING OUR OWN CANOE DOWN TO BRAZIL AFTER SOME TIME LOST IN WORD FIGHTING WE TRIED THE VIRTUES OF AUTHORITY
AND MANUFACTURED A HOST OF LIES AND EXCUSES HE DECLARED THERE WAS BUT ONE LARGE CANOE IN TOWN AND THAT WE MUST SEND TO SUNO FOR ANOTHER AND FOR MEN TO MAN IT THERE WERE INDEED FEW INDIANS IN SANTA ROSA
WAS CONFINED TO HIS SPANISH BLOOD HE HAD LIVED LONG AMONG THE ZAPAROS AND FROM HIM HIS DAUGHTER AND A ZAPARO SERVANT WE OBTAINED MUCH VALUABLE INFORMATION RESPECTING THAT WILD
PRATT ON DISCIPLINE FOREST MUSIC COCA OUR CRAFT AND CREW STORM ON THE NAPO
IT IS NOW OVERGROWN WITH SOUR ORANGE AND CALABASH TREES THE LATTER BEARING LARGE FRUIT SHELLS SO USEFUL TO THE INDIANS IN MAKING PILCHES OR CUPS IN PITCH DARKNESS AND IN A DRIZZLING RAIN
FOR WHILE WE WERE DISPUTING A LARGO NUMBER WENT OFF WITH SHOUTINGS DOWN THE RIVER TO SPEND WEEKS IN THE FOREST HUNTING MONKEYS
DROPPED HIS PADDLE AND TUMBLED INTO A HEAP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CANOE DEAD DRUNK PRATT OUR GIGANTIC MISSISSIPPI BOATMAN WHOM WE HAD ENGAGED AT QUITO AS CAPTAIN AND COOK DOWN THE RIVER AND WHO WAS AN AWFUL GOLIATH IN THE EYES OF THE RED SKINS
A NUMBER OF BIRDS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO HIGH FLIGHTS AND FIVE REPTILIAN SPECIES ON THE PACIFIC SLOPE IDENTICAL WITH SPECIES FOUND ON THE NAPO BREAKFASTING ON FRIED YUCAS ROASTED PLANTAINS FISH AND GUAYUSA
THE MASS BREEDS WORMS SO RAPIDLY HOWEVER AS EDWARDS INFORMED US THAT AFTER THE LAPSE OF A MONTH OR TWO IT IS A JUMBLE OF YUCA SCRAPS AND WRITHING ARTICULATES BUT THE OWNER OF THE HEAP COOLLY SEPARATES THE ANIMAL FROM THE VEGETABLE
THE INDIANS BLEW HORNS TO INDICATE THAT THEY CAME AS FRIENDS THESE HORNS MUST HAVE COME FROM BRAZIL AS THERE ARE NO BOVINES ON THE NAPO
AS WALLACE SAYS OF A SPOT ON THE RIO NEGRO YOU ARE BEWILDERED BY THE CONFLICTING MOTIONS OF THE WATER WHIRLING AND BOILING EDDIES BURST AS IF FROM SOME SUBAQUEOUS EXPLOSION
AND WE MAY ADD THAT NOWHERE IN SOUTH AMERICA WERE WE TROUBLED BY THOSE DIABOLICAL IMPS OF IMAGINATIVE TRAVELERS THE LEAF NOSED SPECIES SO FAR AS OUR EXPERIENCE GOES WE CAN SAY WITH BATES THAT THE VAMPIRE
FAVORED BY A POWERFUL CURRENT AND THE RHYTHMIC PADDLING OF OUR SANTA ROSANS WE MADE THIS DAY SIXTY MILES BUT OUR AVERAGE DAILY RUN WAS FIFTY MILES THE WINDS DOUBTLESS THE TRADES WERE ALMOST UNCHANGEABLY FROM THE EAST
CORN HONEY IT IS SINGULAR THESE INDIANS HAVE NO TERM FOR BEES BUT CALL THEM HONEY AND DISTINGUISH THEM BY THEIR COLOR THE BLACK SPECIES IS SAID TO MAKE THE MOST HONEY AND THE YELLOW THE BEST
SPLIT BAMBOO AND PALM LEAVES IT IS EMBOWERED IN A MAGNIFICENT GROVE OF PLANTAINS AND PAPAYAS IN THE SPACIOUS VESTIBULE IS A BENCH ON WHICH THE INDIAN GOVERNOR AND HIS STAFF SEAT THEMSELVES EVERY MORNING
TO DAY WE ENJOYED OUR LAST GLIMPSE OF THE ANDES FAR AWAY ACROSS THE GREAT FOREST WE HAD TRAVERSED WE COULD SEE THE BEAUTIFUL CONE OF COTOPAXI AND THE FLAT TOP OF CAYAMBI STANDING OUT IN PROUD PRE EMINENCE
TWO SWUNG THEIR HAMMOCKS BETWEEN THE TREES AND THE REST SLEPT IN THE CANOE HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE LEAVING GUAYAQUIL WE WERE TORMENTED BY MUSQUITOES BATS WERE ALSO QUITE NUMEROUS BUT NONE OF THEM WERE BLOOD THIRSTY
SANDOVAL MUTTERED ADIOS IN REPLY TO OURS MEANING NO DOUBT GOOD RIDDANCE WHILE WE SHOUTED A HEARTY GOOD BYE TO EDWARDS AS HE PUSHED HIS WAY UP STREAM TO CONTINUE HIS LONELY BUT CHOSEN INDIAN LIFE ON THE BANKS OF THE YUSUPINO
WE INDUCED THE INDIANS TO TAKE THE BALANCE IN COIN AFTER MANY DELAYS WE PUT OUR BAGGAGE INTO ONE CANOE AND OURSELVES INTO THE OTHER AND PUSHED OFF INTO THE RAPID CURRENT OF THE NAPO
THE FOURTH WHO WAS THE GOVERNOR OF SANTA ROSA WE HONORED WITH THE POST OF STEERSMAN AND HE WAS ALWAYS TO BE SEEN ON THE POOP BEHIND THE KITCHEN STANDING BOLT UPRIGHT ON THE ALERT AND ON THE LOOKOUT ON APPROACHING ANY HUMAN HABITATION
THAN IN THE POSSESSION OF GOOD ONES OF AN APATHETIC TEMPERAMENT AND DULL IMAGINATION WE COULD NOT STIR THEM INTO ADMIRATION OR ENTHUSIASM BY ANY SCIENTIFIC WONDER THE UTMOST MANIFESTATION OF SURPRISE WAS A CLUCK WITH THE TONGUE
SO COMMON ON THE AMAZON IS THE MOST HARMLESS OF ALL BATS IT HAS HOWEVER A MOST HIDEOUS PHYSIOGNOMY A FULL GROWN SPECIMEN WILL MEASURE TWENTY EIGHT INCHES IN EXPANSE OF WING
THE PRICE OF A CANOE FOR THE MARANON IS TWENTY FIVE VARAS OF LIENZO AND THE SAME FOR EACH INDIAN UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD ONLY FIFTY VARAS LEFT BUT THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF THE NOW GOOD NATURED ALCALDE
THE PATH OF THE SUN IS THE PATH OF THE STORM
WHILE A HOST OF REPTILES LED BY THE GIGANTIC BOA CREEP FORTH FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES THE MOST FEROCIOUS CARNIVORES ARE FOUND IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE MOST VENOMOUS SERPENTS HAUNT THE LOWLANDS
AND THE COCA HALTED AND BUILT A RAFT OR CANOE PRESCOTT SAYS A BRIG IN WHICH ORELLANA WAS SENT DOWN THE RIVER TO RECONNOITRE BUT WHO NEVER RETURNED
SEIZED THE FELLOW AND GAVE HIM A TERRIBLE SHAKING THE LIKE OF WHICH WAS NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF IN ALL NAPO AT ONCE THE LIQUOR LEFT THE MUDDLED BRAIN OF THE ASTONISHED CULPRIT AND TAKING HIS PADDLE HE BECAME FROM THAT HOUR THE BEST OF THE CREW
A DISTANCE OF EIGHTY MILES IS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET WE WERE ABOUT SEVEN HOURS IN THE VOYAGE DOWN AND IT TAKES SEVEN DAYS TO POLE BACK THE PASSAGE OF THE RAPIDS IS DANGEROUS TO ALL BUT AN INDIAN
AND AT A REGULAR HOUR SO THAT WE LEARNED WHEN TO EXPECT THEM ABOUT NOON THE EASTERN HORIZON WOULD BECOME SUDDENLY BLACK AND WHEN THIS HAD SPREAD TO THE ZENITH WE HEARD THE RUSH OF A MIGHTY WIND SWEEPING THROUGH THE FOREST AND THE CRASH OF FALLING TREES
WHICH WE BOUGHT OF THE ALCALDE FLOATED ALONGSIDE FOR A TENDER AND WAS VERY SERVICEABLE IN HUNTING GATHERING FUEL ET CETERA IN THE FORECASTLE THE BOWS OF THE LARGE CANOES WHICH PROJECTED BEYOND OUR CABIN SAT THREE INDIANS TO PADDLE
AS OUR POPERO OR PILOT THE SEDATE GOVERNOR GAVE THE CANOE A SHEER WITH THE SWOOP OF HIS LONG PADDLE TURNING IT GRACEFULLY AROUND THE CORNER OF A ROCK AGAINST WHICH IT SEEMED WE MUST BE DASHED AND WE FELT LIKE JOINING IN THE WILD SCREAM OF THE INDIANS
IS THE ONLY WHITE INHABITANT AND HE IS AN INDIAN IN EVERY RESPECT SAVE SPEECH AND COLOR HIS HABITATION IS ONE OF THE LARGEST STRUCTURES ON THE NAPO THE POSTS ARE OF CHONTA PALM THE SIDES AND ROOF OF THE USUAL MATERIAL
WE PRESENTED THE PRESIDENT'S ORDER WHICH COMMANDED ALL CIVIL AND MILITARY POWERS ON THE NAPO TO AID AND NOT TO HINDER THE EXPEDITION
WITH A HICCOUGH DECLARED WE WOULD BE FOREVER GOING DOWN THE RIVER IN SUCH A HUGE CRAFT AND THE INDIANS SMILED OMINOUSLY BUT WHEN OUR GALLANT SHIP LEFT COCA OBEDIENTLY TO THE HELM AND AT THE RATE OF SIX MILES AN HOUR WHEN PADDLES AND CURRENT WORKED TOGETHER
THE BIRDS ARE USUALLY SILENT THOSE THAT HAVE VOICES UTTER A PLAINTIVE SONG OR HOARSE SHRILL CRY OUR DOOR YARDS ARE FAR MORE MELODIOUS ON A MAY MORNING THE MOST COMMON BIRDS ON THE NAPO
THEY FURNISHED THREE CANOES TWO FOR BAGGAGE AND ONE COVERED WITH A PALM LEAF AWNING FOR OURSELVES THE CANOES WERE OF RED CEDAR AND FLAT BOTTOMED THE PADDLES HAD OVAL BLADES TO WHICH SHORT
THEY GAVE US POSSESSION OF THEIR LARGEST HUT IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ROASTING A SEA COW AND THE STENCH WAS INTOLERABLE NEVERTHELESS ONE OF OUR NUMBER BRAVELY THREW DOWN HIS BLANKET WITHIN AND WENT TO SLEEP
CHAPTER FOURTEEN AFLOAT ON THE NAPO DOWN THE RAPIDS
THEY BLOW THEIR HORNS ALSO TO CHARM THE YACU MAMA OR MOTHER OF WATERS AS THEY CALL THE IMAGINARY SERPENT AT DIFFERENT POINTS DOWN THE RIVER THEY DEPOSITED POTS OF CHICHA FOR USE ON THEIR RETURN
THE TOWN IS PLEASANTLY SITUATED ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET ABOVE THE WATER LEVEL A LITTLE BAMBOO CHURCH OPEN ONLY WHEN THE MISSIONARY FROM ARCHIDONA MAKES HIS ANNUAL VISIT
THE QUADRUPEDS OF THE ORIENTE ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN IN THE DRY SEASON NOT A SLOTH NOR ARMADILLO DID WE SEE BUT WHEN THE RAINS DESCEND THE WILDERNESS IS A MENAGERIE OF TIGERS AND TAPIRS PUMAS AND BEARS
OF THE GOLD WASHERS AT FIVE P M WE REACHED THE DESERTED SITE OF OLD SANTA ROSA THE VILLAGE HAVING BEEN REMOVED A FEW YEARS AGO ON ACCOUNT OF ITS UNHEALTHY LOCATION
AS OUR LITTLE CRAFT SHOT LIKE AN ARROW PAST THE DANGER AND DOWN THE RAPIDS AND DANCED ON THE WATERS BELOW IN FOUR HOURS WE WERE ABREAST THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF AGUANO ON THE OPPOSITE BANK WE COULD SEE THE TAMBOS
AND SUPPLYING IT WITH FOOD NOT POTENT ENOUGH FOR THE NURTURE OF THE IDEAL WITH THIS DIFFERENCE HOWEVER THAT THE CRAMPED AND STINTED THING COMES OUT IF NO QUEEN THEN A WORKING BEE
TO STAND UP IN THAT PULPIT AND SPEAK ABOUT MYSELF I WHO EVEN IF I HAD ANY OPINIONS COULD NEVER SEE REASON FOR PRESENTING THEM TO OTHER PEOPLE IT'S MY OFFICE IS IT NOT ME
THEY KNOW THEM ALREADY SAID POLWARTH I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT A MAN WHO LOOKS THINGS IN THE FACE AS YOU DO THE MOMENT THEY CONFRONT YOU HAS NOT LIVED AT ALL HAS NEVER
AND HE IN HIS TURN POINTED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GREAT TOWER THE CURATE WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND MADE NO ANSWER
THAN YOUR SAINT THE OLD JEW SAUL OF TARSUS IT DID NOT OCCUR TO WINGFOLD THAT PEOPLE GENERALLY SPEAK FROM THE SURFACES NOT THE DEPTHS OF THEIR MINDS EVEN WHEN THOSE DEPTHS ARE MOVED NOR YET THAT POSSIBLY
FOR THE DAY DRAWS NIGH WHEN WE ALL GO OUT I DON'T LIKE THE SONG SAID HELEN WRINKLING HER BROWS A LITTLE IT SOUNDS WELL HEATHENISH
IN THE TACIT UNDERSTANDING THAT A SERMON MUST SEEM TO BE A MAN'S OWN ALTHOUGH ALL IN THE CONGREGATION KNOW AND THE WOULD BE PREACHER KNOWS THAT THEY KNOW THAT IT IS NONE OF HIS THEN
HAVE THEY ANY ANATOMICAL SYNONYM BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT IT WAS GOOD POETRY DO YOU THINK POETRY AND COMMON SENSE NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER ASKED WINGFOLD I CONFESS A
WHICH HAD USUALLY MORE OF VIVACITY THAN KEENNESS MORE OF GOOD SPIRITS THAN WIT
SAD SUBMISSION TO THE INEVITABLE
THE MORE NEED OF TEACHERS THAT THE PROPHETS ARE SO FEW AND A MAN MAY RIGHT HONESTLY BE A CLERGYMAN WHO TEACHES THE PEOPLE THOUGH HE MAY POSSESS NONE OF THE GIFTS OF PROPHECY
AT ONCE SHE WOULD NOT BUT I AM SPEAKING NOT OF CREEDS BUT OF BELIEFS AND I ASSERT THAT THE FORMS OF COMMON CHRISTIAN SPEECH REGARDING DEATH COME NEARER
STILL SOME WHO DID NOT LIKE HER SAID HARD EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE NO ONE HAD EVER CALLED HER NELLY YET SHE HAD LONG REMAINED A GIRL
POLWARTH LAUGHED BUT WITH A CERTAIN SERIOUSNESS IN HIS MERRIMENT WHICH HOWEVER TOOK NOTHING FROM ITS GENUINENESS INDEED
NO HE MAKES THE BEST OF IT AND AS MERRILY AS HE CAN AS HE CAN I GRANT YOU SAID WINGFOLD HERE MISSUS RAMSHORN WOKE
I WAS WATCHING TWO CHILDREN PICKING THEM UP TO DAY THAT MAY BE THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MORE CHILDREN THAN GROWN MEN RETURNED BASCOMBE FOR MY PART I WOULD SWEEP AWAY ALL ILLUSIONS AND GET AT THE HEART OF THE AFFAIR
AND IN DISCOVERING THIS I SHALL BE ABLE TO PRESENT HER TO MY READER WITH A LITTLE MORE CIRCUMSTANCE SHE SAT BEFORE THE FIRE IN A RATHER MASCULINE POSTURE
WORTH GIVING TO ANOTHER AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME VERY UNREASONABLE TO SUBJECT A HELPLESS CONGREGATION TO THE BLUNDERING ATTEMPTS OF SUCH A FELLOW TO PUT INTO THE FORMS OF REASONABLE SPEECH
KNOWS NO WAKING SHE IS GONE FOR EVER CRIES THE MOTHER OVER HER DAUGHTER AND THAT IS WHY SUCH THINGS ARE NOT TO BE MENTIONED BECAUSE IN THEIR HEARTS THEY HAVE NO HOPE
IT WAS OF RED BRICK AND FLAT FACED IN THE STYLE OF QUEEN ANNE'S TIME SO THAT THE LIGHT COULD DO NOTHING WITH IT IN THE WAY OF SHADOW AND DWELT ONLY ON THE DIGNITY OF ITS UNPRETENTIOUSNESS BUT ALOFT
I COULD ROAR YOU AS TWERE ANY NIGHTINGALE YOU HAVE HAD YOUR SORROWS THEN GEORGE NEVER ANYTHING WORSE YET THAN A TAILOR'S BILL HELEN AND I HOPE YOU WON'T PROVIDE ME WITH ANY
OVER ITS RIDGE THE MOON FLOATED IN THE SOFTEST LOVELIEST BLUE WITH JUST A CLOUD HERE AND THERE TO SHOW HOW BLUE IT WAS AND A SPARKLE WHERE ITS BLUENESS TOOK FIRE IN A STAR IT WAS AUTUMN ALMOST WINTER BELOW
REASONABLE AND BESIDES A MAN OUGHT TO SPEAK OUT WHAT HE THINKS SO HERE GOES TELL ME HONESTLY DO YOU BELIEVE ONE WORD OF ALL THAT
TO A CLERGYMAN APPEAR OBJECTIONABLE NOR AS A PARTISAN WAS SHE ALTOGETHER SATISFIED WITH THE CURATE THAT HE DID NOT SEEM INCLINED TO TAKE CLERICAL EXCEPTION HE ATE HIS DINNER QUIETLY
WHO SEEMED MORE PLAYFULLY INCLINED THAN USUAL BUT SHE ADDED WITH A SMILE WOULD YOUR SILENCE BE VOLUNTARY OR ENFORCED WHAT RETURNED BASCOMBE YOU THINK I COULD NOT PLAIN MY WOES TO THE MOON WHY NOT I AS WELL AS ANOTHER
BUT AS I HAVE SAID ESCAPED THE SNARE IN A VERY DIRECT AND SIMPLE FASHION SHE WENT FAST ASLEEP AND NEVER WOKE TILL HER MAID BROUGHT HER THE CUP OF KITCHEN TEA FROM WHICH THE INMATES OF SOME HOUSES DERIVE THE STRENGTH
THEN I WISH MY OFFICE WOULD WRITE HIS OWN SERMONS HE CAN READ THE PRAYERS WELL ENOUGH ALL HIS LIFE A LITTLE HEAVE OF PENT UP HUMOUR WOULD NOW AND THEN SHAKE HIS BURDEN INTO A MORE COMFORTABLE POSITION UPON HIS BENDING SHOULDERS
RATHER THAN THE CONVICTION THAT THE FIRESIDE IN HER OWN ROOM WAS RENDERED EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE BY THE UNFRIENDLY ASPECT OF THINGS OUTSIDE AND THE ROAR IN THE CHIMNEY WHICH HAPPILY WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY A CHANGE IN THE CURRENT OF THE SMOKE
FOR MINE IT SHALL BURN WITH A FEARLESS FLAME IN THE FRONT OF THE DARKNESS THAT HAS NO NAME SUNSHINE AND WIND ARE YE THERE HO HO ARE YE COMRADES OR LORDS AS YE SHINE AND BLOW I CARE NOT I
DECLINE TO PLACE MYSELF BETWEEN THE HORNS OF ANY SUCH DILEMMA RETURNED WINGFOLD WHO WAS NOW MORE THAN A LITTLE ANNOYED AT HIS PERSISTENCY IN FORCING HIS WAY WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF ANOTHER'S PERSONALITY IT IS BUT ONE MORE PROOF
THAT ITS MEANING WAS ILLEGIBLE ERE IT HAD QUIVERED ALONG HIS LIP AND VANISHED
BUT SCANTY ONES INDEED WITH THE UNIVERSE
IN SO FAR AS THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND HAS CEASED TO BE A PREACHING CHURCH AND I DON'T CALL NINE TENTHS OF WHAT GOES BY THE NAME OF IT PREACHING SHE HAS FORGOTTEN A MIGHTY PART OF HER HIGH CALLING
EVEN TO THE SELF DECEPTION OF A MAN OTHERWISE REMARKABLE FOR HONESTY AND DIRECTNESS GOOD NIGHT MISTER WINGFOLD
NO NOR THE FAITH OF ANY OF THE LAST FEW GENERATIONS
I DO NOT NOW SEE WELL HOW YOU ARE LEADING ME SAID WINGFOLD CONSIDERABLY ASTONISHED AT BOTH THE APTNESS AND FLUENCY WITH WHICH A MAN IN HIS HOST'S POSITION WAS ABLE TO EXPRESS HIMSELF PRAY
THE LOOK OF A SAGE BUT ONE WHO HAS MADE NO DISCOVERY SHE HAD JUST FINISHED THE NOVEL OF THE DAY AND WAS SUFFERING A MILD REACTION THE MILDER PERHAPS
PARTLY THROUGH HIS MARRIAGE WITH A HINDOO LADY BY WHOM HE HAD ONE CHILD A BOY SOME THREE YEARS YOUNGER THAN HELEN WHEN HE DIED HE LEFT HIS FORTUNE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE TWO CHILDREN
HE WAS NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH IN HIS OWN EYES FOR THAT BUT HE DID NOT CHOOSE TO GO FARTHER THAT'S A FINE OLD CHURCH HE SAID POINTING TO THE DARK MASS INVADING THE BLUE SO SOLID YET SO CLEAR IN OUTLINE
WHITHER SOME OF OUR MOST NOTED PREACHERS GO TO DIG FOR THEIR FIRST INSPIRATIONS
WINGFOLD WAS SILENT THOUGHTFUL SAYING TO HIMSELF HOW STRAIGHT AN HONEST BOW CAN SHOOT BUT THIS INVOLVES SOMETHING AWFUL
THEIR VERSES ARE A RELIEF TO THEM AND DO NOBODY ANY HARM
THAT SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE DISCOVERED HAD SHE BEEN AS WIDE AWAKE AS SHE WAS SOUND ASLEEP THAT THE SONG I SUNG WAS ANYTHING BUT A GOOD CHRISTIAN BALLAD PARDON ME I THINK YOU ARE WRONG THERE
THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN IN HER LIFE NOW THINKING ESPECIALLY TO ONE WHO TRIES IT FOR THE FIRST TIME IS SELDOM OR NEVER A QUITE COMFORTABLE OPERATION AND HENCE
SAID WINGFOLD AND BURLESQUING HIM
BACKWARDS YOU ARE INDEBTED TO YOUR FOREFATHERS FOR YOUR WOULD BE BELIEF AS WELL AS FOR THEIR GENUINE CHURCHES
NOT WITH HIS SERMON IN HIS EYE BUT WITH HIS PEOPLE IN HIS HEART MEN IN BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS HAVE SO LITTLE TIME FOR READING OR THINKING AND
LIGHTED HIS CIGAR ALL ROUND ITS EXTREME PERIPHERY TOOK IT FROM HIS MOUTH REGARDED ITS GLOWING END WITH A SMILE OF SATISFACTION AND BURST INTO A LAUGH IT WAS NOT A SCORNFUL LAUGH
CONQUERED DEATH AND ALL THAT RUBBISH DID YOU NEVER OBSERVE THE WAY THEY LOOK IF THE LEAST ALLUSION IS MADE TO DEATH OR THE ETERNITY THEY SAY THEY EXPECT BEYOND IT DO THEY NOT STARE AS IF YOU HAD COMMITTED A BREACH OF MANNERS
TRUE BUT OF WHAT SORT ALL IMITATION NEVER AN ORIGINAL AMONGST THEM ALL IF THEY HAD FOUND OUT THE RIGHT WAY WHY CHANGE IT GOOD BUT IT IS RATHER OMINOUS FOR THE CLAIM OF A DIVINE ORIGIN TO YOUR RELIGION
PARALLEL WITH THE LINES OF THE CHAIR HER ARMS LYING ON ITS ARMS AND THE FINGERS OF EACH HAND FOLDED DOWN OVER THE END OF EACH ARM SQUARE STRAIGHT RIGHT ANGLED GAZING INTO THE FIRE WITH SOMETHING OF
THE HOURS BETWEEN LUNCHEON AND TEA ARE CONFESSEDLY DULL BUT DULNESS IS NOT INIMICAL TO A CERTAIN KIND OF COMFORT AND HELEN LIKED TO BE THAT WAY COMFORTABLE
AWAY FROM ITS STORMING ENEMY SHE DID NOT FEEL INCLINED TO GO OUT
AND THEMSELVES WHO WRITE THEM MORE HARM THAN ANYBODY CONFIRMING THEM IN TEARFUL HABITS AND TEACHING EYES UNUSED TO WEEP
AND THE SUBJECT WAS DROPPED LEAVING MISTER WINGFOLD IN SOME PERPLEXITY AS TO THIS YOUNG MAN AND HIS TALK AND WHAT THE PHENOMENON SIGNIFIED
BEING SOMEWHAT BORED THEN AND DIMLY AWARE THAT TO BE BORED WAS OUT OF HARMONY WITH SOMETHING OR OTHER HELEN WAS ON THE VERGE OF THINKING
HE SAID AND WINGFOLD ACCEPTED THE DISMISSAL OF THE SUBJECT
IS OFTEN FROM MERE ATROPHY BUT A SKELETON
WAS HEATHENISM AFTER ALL SECRETLY CHERISHED AND ABOUT TO BECOME FASHIONABLE IN ENGLISH SOCIETY HE SAW LITTLE OF ITS PHASES AND FOR
HELEN WAS TURNING OVER SOME MUSIC
THE LITTLE MAN TURNED AND FOR A MOMENT LOOKED AT HIM WITH A DOUBTFUL AND SOMEWHAT PAINED EXPRESSION AS IF HE HAD NOT BEEN PREPARED FOR SUCH AN ENTRANCE ON A SOLEMN QUESTION
FOOLISH ANCESTORS AND WHICH HAVE BEEN INSTILLED INTO HIM AS WELL WITH HIS EARLIEST NOURISHMENT BOTH BODILY AND MENTAL BUT COME NOW I DO LOVE OPEN DEALING I AM MYSELF OPEN AS THE DAY
EVERY ONE OF WHICH NATURE FITS FOR A QUEEN BUT ITS NURSES PREVENT FROM GROWING ONE BY PROVIDING FOR IT A CELL TOO NARROW FOR THE UNROLLING OF ROYALTY
RELIGION ITSELF IS THE SAME WAY AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE ABOUT THE CHURCH BUT DON'T MENTION CHRIST
MAKE UP HIS SERMONS FROM THE BOOKS HE READS YES IF HE CANNOT DO BETTER
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PROPHECY I MEAN
NEITHER OF THEM CARED TO DRINK MORE THAN A COUPLE OF GLASSES THEY SOON REJOINED THE LADIES IN THE DRAWING ROOM MISSUS RAMSHORN WAS TAKING HER USUAL FORTY WINKS IN HER ARM CHAIR AND THEIR ENTRANCE DID NOT DISTURB HER
FANCY HEARING ONE OF THE FELLOW'S HEART STRINGS CRACK AND TAKING IT FOR A STRING OF HIS FIDDLE IN THE PRESS
THEN I AM TO UNDERSTAND MISTER WINGFOLD THAT YOU NEITHER BELIEVE NOR DISBELIEVE THE TENETS OF THE CHURCH WHOSE BREAD YOU EAT SAID BASCOMBE WITH THE AIR OF A REPROVER OF SIN
BY A KIND OF INSTINCT WHETHER A MAN BE PREACHING HIS OWN SERMONS OR NOT
BASCOMBE YAWNED BEHIND HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WINGFOLD GAZED AT THE PROFILE OF THE PLAYER WONDERING HOW WITH SUCH FINE FEATURES AND COMPLEXION WITH SUCH A FINE SHAPED AND WELL SET HEAD HER
AND NO SHEPHERD AT THIS MOMENT RACHEL ENTERED WITH A SMALL TEA TRAY SHE COULD CARRY ONLY LITTLE THINGS AND A FEW AT A TIME SHE CAST A GLANCE OF ALMOST LOVING SOLICITUDE AT THE YOUNG MAN
MUST AT LENGTH GET WEARY OF HIS PALTRY SELF BUT HELEN FROM THE SLOW RATE OF HER EXPANSION WAS NOT OLD ENOUGH YET NOR WAS SHE IN ANY SPECIAL SENSE
BY FAITH NO DOUBT ANSWERED BASCOMBE LAUGHING
I MUST NOT ALLOW YOU TO MISTAKE MY SILENCE MISTER BASCOMBE HE ANSWERED THE SAME MOMENT IT IS NOT EASY TO REPLY TO SUCH DEMANDS ALL AT ONCE IT IS NOT EASY TO SAY IN TIMES LIKE THESE AND AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE WHAT OR
IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU SIR TO TAKE MY PRESUMPTION IN SUCH GOOD PART PRAY SIT DOWN SIR YOU WILL FIND THAT CHAIR A COMFORTABLE ONE PRESUMPTION ECHOED WINGFOLD THE PRESUMPTION WAS ALL ON MY PART AND
THE KINDNESS ON YOURS BUT YOU MUST FIRST HEAR MY EXPLANATION SUCH AS IT IS IT MAKES THE MATTER HARDLY A JOT THE BETTER ONLY A MAN WOULD NOT WILLINGLY LOOK WORSE OR BETTER EITHER THAN HE IS
AND HIS OWN IGNORANCE OF JEREMY TAYLOR BUT HE CONCLUDED SINCE YOU SET ME ABOUT IT MY JUDGMENT HAS CAPSIZED ITSELF
THE THOUGHTS OF OTHER PEOPLE HAD PASSED THROUGH HER IN TOLERABLE PLENTY LEAVING MANY A PHANTOM CONCLUSION BEHIND BUT THIS WAS THEIR THINKING NOT HERS SHE HAD THOUGHT NO MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY NOW AND THEN
DID YOU NOT TAKE TO THE CHURCH AS A PROFESSION IN WHICH YOU MIGHT EAT A PIECE OF BREAD AS SOMEBODY SAYS IN YOUR OWN BLESSED BIBLE DRY ENOUGH BREAD IT MAY BE FOR THE OLD LADY IS NOT OVER GENEROUS TO HER YOUNGER CHILDREN
OF COURSE A MAN TO WHOM NO MESSAGE HAS BEEN PERSONALLY GIVEN HAS NO RIGHT TO TAKE THE PLACE OF A PROPHET AND CANNOT SAVE BY MORE OR LESS OF SIMULATION BUT THERE IS ROOM FOR TEACHERS
IN ANOTHER PROFESSION TO SPEAK HIS MIND BUT SILENCE SUCH AS YOURS CASTING A SHADOW BACKWARD OVER YOUR PAST REQUIRE COURAGE
NEAR THE FIREPLACE AND A DORMER WINDOW AS WELL THE LOW WALLS UP TO THE SLOPE WERE FILLED WITH BOOKS BOOKS LAY ON THE TABLE ON THE BED ON CHAIRS AND IN CORNERS EVERYWHERE AHA
INDEED HER DISSATISFACTION WENT SO FAR THAT ALTHOUGH THE FIRE KEPT BURNING AWAY IN PERFECT CONTENT BEFORE HER ENHANCED BY THE BELLOWING COMPLAINT OF THE WIND IN THE CHIMNEY SHE YET CAME NEARER THINKING
FOR THAT WHICH CHIEFLY DISTINGUISHES MAN FROM THOSE HE CALLS THE LOWER ANIMALS IS THE FACULTY HE MOST RARELY EXERCISES TRUE HELEN SUPPOSED SHE COULD THINK LIKE OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE
HIS VOICE WAS A FULL BASS ONE FULL OF TONE EACH MAN HAS HIS LAMPFUL HIS LAMPFUL OF OIL
WRAPT UP IN HERSELF IT WAS ONLY THAT SHE HAD NEVER YET BROKEN THE SHELL WHICH CONTINUES TO SHUT IN SO MANY HUMAN CHICKENS LONG AFTER THEY IMAGINE THEMSELVES CITIZENS OF THE REAL WORLD
NEITHER MORE NOR LESS IT IS A NOBLE WEAKNESS AND FAR ENOUGH FROM COMMON I AM SORRY TO THINK RETURNED POLWARTH THE CURATE THEN TOLD THE GATE KEEPER OF HIS UNCLE'S LEGACY
AFRICAN EXPLORERS PYRAMID INSPECTORS AND SUCH LIKE BUT FOR EVERY MAN AND WOMAN BORN INTO THE BLINDNESS OF THE PLANET IS TO DISCOVER AFTER WHICH DISCOVERY THERE IS
AND THEN HE RESUMED TURNING AGAIN TO WINGFOLD
AS IF INTERCEDING FOR A CULPRIT AND BEGGING THE MASTER NOT TO BE TOO HARD UPON HIM BUT THE LITTLE MAN SMILED SUCH A SWEET SMILE OF RE ASSURANCE THAT HER FACE
THAT SHE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFIED WITH THE CONSUMMATION FOR THE HEROINE HAD AFTER MUCH SORROW AND PATIENT ENDURANCE AT LENGTH MARRIED A MAN WHOM SHE COULD NOT HELP KNOWING
ONLY IT BE ABOVE BOARD I BELIEVE SOME CLERGYMEN THINK THE ONLY EVIL LIES IN DETECTION I DOUBT IF THEY EVER ESCAPE IT AND BELIEVE THE AMOUNT OF SUCCESSFUL DECEPTION IN THAT KIND TO BE VERY SMALL INDEED
OWN HEART YOUR DELIGHT IN SOMETHING YOU HAD FOUND OUT OR SOMETHING YOU FELT MUCH NO ANSWERED WINGFOLD I HAVE NOTHING NEVER HAD ANYTHING
CHAPTER FOUR THEIR TALK DURING DINNER BASCOMBE HAD THE TALK MOSTLY TO HIMSELF AND RATTLED WELL OCCASIONALLY REBUKED BY HIS AUNT FOR SOME REMARK WHICH MIGHT
COULD HAVE COME TO SEND HELEN POETRY I CANNOT IMAGINE BUT THAT VERY MORNING SHE HAD RECEIVED BY POST A SMALL VOLUME OF VERSE WHICH ALTHOUGH JUST OUT AND BY AN UNKNOWN AUTHOR HAD ALREADY BEEN TALKED OF
WAKE THEM UP LEST THEIR SLEEP TURN TO DEATH NEXT TO MAKE THEM HUNGRY AND LASTLY TO SUPPLY THAT HUNGER AND FOR ALL THESE THINGS THE PASTOR
I AM GLAD THE MASON WORK IS TO YOUR MIND RETURNED BASCOMBE ALMOST COMPASSIONATELY IT MUST BE SOME SATISFACTION PERHAPS CONSOLATION TO YOU
LET HIM BRING SOMETHING OLD OUT OF ANOTHER MAN'S
THE FINER OR AT LEAST MORE ETHEREAL QUALITIES OF THE THING ITSELF YOU DO NOT OBJECT TO MUSIC IN CHURCH FOR INSTANCE BASCOMBE WAS ON THE POINT OF SAYING HE OBJECTED TO IT NOWHERE EXCEPT IN CHURCH
AND HAD SHE BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE FACT AND QUESTIONED WHY WOULD HAVE ANSWERED BECAUSE SHE SO SELDOM SAW REASON SHE WAS WHAT ALL HER FRIENDS CALLED A SENSIBLE GIRL
LEANING TO THAT OPINION REPLIED BASCOMBE WITH A HALF CONSCIOUS SMILE
THAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN REMOVED A WEEK AGO OUT UPON THE OLD FASHIONED GARDEN AND MEADOWS BEYOND WHERE EACH LONELY TREE BOWED WITH DRIFTING GARMENTS
AND IN THEIR MINDS NO COURAGE TO FACE THE FACTS OF EXISTENCE WE HAVEN'T THE PLUCK OF THE OLD FELLOWS WHO THAT THEY MIGHT LOOK DEATH HIMSELF IN THE FACE WITHOUT DISMAY
HELEN WAS NOW THREE AND TWENTY AND HER OWN MISTRESS HER APPEARANCE SUGGESTED NORWEGIAN BLOOD FOR SHE WAS TALL BLUE EYED AND DARK HAIRED BUT FAIR SKINNED WITH REGULAR FEATURES AND AN OVER
BEFORE HE HAD THUS CONCLUDED THE SENTENCE A LITTLE SCORN HAD CREPT INTO HIS TONE
A WOMAN'S WEAKNESS FOR THE SIDE ATTACKED IN ADDITION TO A HUMAN PARTIALITY FOR FAIR PLAY NO NOT BAD AT ALL FOR ABSOLUTE NONSENSE SAID BASCOMBE HE HAD BEEN READING HEINE
FAR FROM IT WHEN I SAY THAT SHE CAME NEAR THINKING I SAY MORE FOR HER THAN ANY BUT THE FEW WHO KNOW WHAT THINKING IS WILL UNDERSTAND
HOW MUCH A MAN BELIEVES BUT WHATEVER MY ANSWER MIGHT BE HAD I TIME TO CONSIDER IT MY SILENCE MUST AT LEAST NOT BE INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE AS MY PROFESSION INDICATES THAT AT ALL EVENTS WOULD BE UNTRUE
AND HAS NO BUSINESS IN ANY PULPIT BUT OUGHT TO BETAKE HIMSELF TO SOME OTHER EMPLOYMENT WHATEVER HE MAY HAVE BEEN PREDESTINED TO I MEAN MADE FIT FOR
SHE ALWAYS FELT HAPPIER IN A NEW DRESS WHEN IT WAS MADE TO HER MIND AND FITTED HER BODY AND WHEN THE SUN SHONE SHE WAS LIGHTER HEARTED THAN WHEN IT RAINED I HAD WRITTEN MERRIER BUT HELEN WAS SELDOM MERRY
OR IT MAY BE ONLY THAT IT IS THEIR HUMOUR TO BE SAD SAID WINGFOLD BUT DON'T YOU THINK HE CONTINUED IT IS HARDLY WORTH WHILE TO BE INDIGNANT WITH THEM
POSSIBLY BUT WHAT WE HAVE OF IT IN HORACE WOULD NEVER HAVE REACHED US BUT FOR THE FORMS INTO WHICH HE HAS CAST IT HOW MUCH MORE ENTICING ACORNS IN THE CUP ARE
IDLE PEOPLE HAVE STILL LESS THAT THEIR MEANS OF GRACE AS THE THEOLOGIANS SAY ARE CONFINED TO DISCIPLINE WITHOUT NOURISHMENT WHENCE THEIR RELIGION IF THEY HAVE ANY
TAKE YOU FOR A MAN OF STONE AND LIME
IN THY SLEEP DID IT MAKE THEE START TWAS A CHORD IN TWAIN THAT SPRANG BUT THE LYRE SHELL WAS MY HEART HE TOOK A PULL AT THE STOUT LAID HIS HEAD ON THE TABLE AND SOBBED LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE
SAID WINGFOLD AS HE ENTERED AND CAST HIS EYES AROUND THERE IS NO ROOM FOR SURPRISE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE FOUND ME OUT SO EASILY MISTER POLWARTH HERE YOU HAVE A LEGION OF DETECTIVES FOR SUCH RASCALS
SIX FEET OF IT GOOD HE GLANCED AT THE CHURCH TOWER IT HAD NOT VANISHED IN MIST IT STILL MADE ITS OWN STRONG CLEAR MARK ON THE ETERNAL BLUE
WHICH AS I READ IT AMOUNTS TO THIS THAT I AM ONE OF THE GREATEST HUMBUGS YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HA HA HA NO NO
NOW I AM GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU SAID BASCOMBE ABRUPTLY AND STOPPING HE TURNED TOWARDS HIS COMPANION AND TOOK THE FULL FLAVOURED HAVANNAH FROM HIS LIPS I LIKE YOU HE WENT ON FOR YOU SEEM
ON HIS DEATH BED EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT I SHOULD SUPPORT THEIR TEACHING BY MY EXAMPLE FOR HAVING GONE OVER THEM SOME TEN OR FIFTEEN TIMES IN THE COURSE OF HIS INCUMBENCY AND BETTERED EACH
A SINGLE WORD OF AGREEMENT IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT HE WAS HUMOURING A YOUNGER MAN BUT THE TRUTH WAS THE CURATE HAD NOT YET SEEN CAUSE FOR OPPOSING HIM HOW ANY FRIEND
NOR HAD SHE EVER YET BEEN AWARE OF SELF REBUKE BECAUSE OF THE LIKING LET US SEE WHAT KIND AND DEGREE OF COMFORT SHE HAD IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR AND A HALF ATTAINED
BUT NO HAND SHAKING
IF I EVER HAD A GRIEF I SHOULD HAVE ALONG WITH IT THE DECENCY TO KEEP IT TO MYSELF
BUT ALAS THOSE HALCYON DAYS WERE ALL TOO BRIEF SUDDENLY THE SCALES FELL FROM MY EYES A SCENE OCCURRED BETWEEN US AND WE PARTED TO THINK THAT SIN SHOULD LIE FOR YEARS IN THE BLOOD
PRESENTLY SHE REAPPEARED AND WE WENT TO DINE TOGETHER AT A RESTAURANT IN PICCADILLY AFTERWARDS VISITING A THEATRE AND SPENDING A VERY PLEASANT EVENING POOR DICK I WAS SORRY THAT HE WAS SO INFATUATED
IS ON CAMPDEN HILL KENSINGTON WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF WHERE I RESIDE AND IN THE CENTRE OF AN AESTHETIC ARTISTIC COLONY WE HAVE BEEN CHUMS FOR YEARS FOR ON MANY OCCASIONS HE HAS DISPLAYED HIS TALENT AS A BLACK AND WHITE ARTIST
COME AWAY ZELIE LET US GO I HEARD NO MORE FOR THEY TURNED AND LEFT HAVING ACTED AS EAVESDROPPER I COULD HARDLY QUESTION THEM NEVERTHELESS I WAS SORELY PUZZLED LOOK READ THAT
WE BOTH CRIED IN AMAZEMENT DICK SHE GASPED YOU YOU HAVE FOUND ME SHE REELED BACKWARDS AND BEFORE WE COULD SAVE HER FELL SENSELESS TO THE FLOOR A FEW WORDS OF EXCUSE
BUT BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL LIFE WAS EXTINCT THE COUNT IS INSANE WITH GRIEF MORE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE MAID DISCOVERED THAT HER LADYSHIP HAD LEFT A LETTER TO SOME MAN SHE CALLS DICK TELLING HIM THAT SHE LOVED HIM
WAS STANDING WITH A YOUNG GIRL IN THE CROWD AROUND THE EASEL WHY LOOK PAPA THAT FACE THE GIRL CRIED WHEN HER EYES FELL UPON THE CANVAS IT IS HER PORTRAIT SURELY THE SIGNORE CANNOT KNOW DIO
AND I CONFESS I USED WHAT WEIGHT MY OPINIONS POSSESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF HER ADVANCEMENT IT IS NEEDLESS TO REFER TO THE SMOOTH AND UNINTERRUPTED COURSE OF OUR LOVE SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT WE WERE BOTH BOHEMIANS
AND SHE HAD HER FOOT UPON MY NECK BUT IT IS ALL OVER HE ADDED BITTERLY I SHALL THINK NO MORE OF HER THEN HE WISHED ME AN ABRUPT FAREWELL AND LEFT
DURING THE YEARS THAT HAVE GONE I HAVE MANY MANY TIMES WONDERED WHAT HAD BECOME OF YOU FOR IN YOUR WRITINGS I READ PLAINLY HOW SOURED AND EMBITTERED YOU HAD BECOME AND WHERE IS ORANMORE DEAD
IT WAS A COLD FORMAL NOTE MERELY A FEW LINES OF HURRIED SCRAWL AND READ YOU ARE RIGHT I HAVE BEEN FALSE TO YOU THINK NO MORE OF ME BY THE TIME YOU RECEIVE THIS I SHALL BE ON MY WAY TO NEW YORK
A GLANCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO RECOGNISE THAT THE SPRAWLY WRITING WAS ETHEL'S TAKING IT UP I EAGERLY READ THE FOLLOWING LINES IT CONTAINED DEAR DICK I REGRET TO TELL YOU THAT CIRCUMSTANCES PRECLUDE ME FROM EVER MEETING YOU AGAIN
THE LIMIT FOR SENDING IN TO THE ACADEMY WAS APPROACHING BUT DICK DID NOT WRITE AND I COULD ONLY WONDER VAGUELY WHERE HE WAS WANDERING IT WAS A GREAT PITY I THOUGHT THAT SUCH A FINE WORK SHOULD NOT BE EXHIBITED
DEAD I CRIED IMPOSSIBLE YES SIR HER MAID DISCOVERED HER IN HER BOUDOIR LATE LAST NIGHT AND FOUND THAT SHE HAD TAKEN AN OVERDOSE OF MORPHIA WE SENT FOR THE DOCTOR
AND DRAWN IT ACROSS THE FACE MAKING A GREAT UGLY DISFIGURING DAUB OVER THE FOREHEAD AND EYEBROWS UTTERLY RUINING THE FEATURES AND PRODUCING A CURIOUSLY FORBIDDING EFFECT THE COLOUR WAS NOT DRY
I SAW THAT HE WAS HAGGARD EYED AND WILD LOOKING FROM HIS CONVERSATION I KNEW THAT TIME HAD NOT HEALED THE WOUND IN HIS HEART I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO THANK YOU SUFFICIENTLY OLD CHAP FOR TOUCHING UP MY DAUB
I HAVE REFUSED REFUSED WHY FOR REASONS OF MY OWN
WHEN I HAD BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPLIMENT SHE PAID ME SHE SAID ONE THING ALWAYS STRIKES ME IN READING YOUR STORIES YOUR WOMEN ARE INEVITABLY FALSE AND FICKLE PERHAPS HOWEVER YOU WRITE FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
YET AS SHE TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL FACE TOWARDS ME I WAS STRUCK BY THE COMPLETE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL AND MORAL FRAILTY THAT SHE PRESENTED SHE EXPRESSED PLEASURE AT MEETING ME REMARKING THAT SHE HAD READ MY LAST NOVEL AND HAD BEEN KEENLY INTERESTED IN IT
SHE SAID STRIVING TO SUPPRESS A SOB FORGIVE ME I I WAS MAD THEN I LOVED YOU BUT I DID NOT APPREHEND THE CONSEQUENCE LOVE WHAT NONSENSE TO SPEAK OF IT WHEN THROUGH YOUR BASENESS
IN THE PRIVATE GALLERY OF HIS GREAT PALACE IN ROME LITTLE DREAMING THAT
SO MAKING AN EXCUSE I BADE THEM AU REVOIR AND RETURNED TO MY OWN BOOK LINED DEN UNLOCKING A DRAWER IN MY WRITING TABLE I TOOK OUT A PACKET OF LETTERS THAT STILL EMITTED A STALE ODOUR OF VIOLETS
YOU KNOW NOTHING OLD FELLOW HE EXCLAIMED FLUSHING ANGRILY BUT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
UNTIL THE EVENING IT WAS PACKED IN A CRATE AND SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE IT IS PERHAPS APROPOS THAT I SHOULD RELATE THE NARRATIVE THE STUDIO OF MY OLD FRIEND DICK CARRUTHERS THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT
MY COMPANION HAD A CHEQUE FOR FOUR FIGURES IN HIS POCKET WE WERE ABOUT TO MAKE OUR ADIEUX BUT THE COUNT WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT DINNER WILL BE READY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HE SAID YOU MUST STAY
AND YOU WILL TREAT HIM AS YOU TREATED ME NO NO I LOVE HIM SHE SAID IN A FIERCE HALF WHISPER ADDING
A STRAY COPY OF AN ENGLISH NEWSPAPER CONTAINING A NOTICE OF HIS WORK WHICH DICK PICKED UP IN A HOTEL HOWEVER CAUSED HIM TO RETURN HE BURST INTO MY ROOM UNCEREMONIOUSLY ONE MORNING STILL ATTIRED IN HIS TRAVELLING ULSTER
BUT I SAW VERY LITTLE OF DICK HE HAD RECEIVED A COMMISSION FROM ONE OF THE ILLUSTRATED PAPERS TO MAKE A SERIES OF SKETCHES OF SCENERY IN SCOTLAND
ETHEL WILL NOT SIT FOR ANY OTHER SUBJECT IT HARDLY DOES HER JUSTICE DOES IT IT IS A STRANGE FANCY OF MINE SHE EXPLAINED WHEN I HAD GREETED HER I'M SURE THE DRESS IS VERY BECOMING ISN'T IT
SHE IMPLORED TEARFULLY AT LEAST I AM HONEST MY OBJECT IN COMING THIS AFTERNOON WAS TO REPAY THE MONEY I I BORROWED
AND HOLDING A LIGHTED CIGARETTE BETWEEN HER DAINTY FINGERS DICK FLUNG DOWN HIS PALETTE AND CAME FORWARD TO INTRODUCE ME HER DARK EYES MET MINE AND WE TACITLY AGREED NOT TO RECOGNISE EACH OTHER THEREFORE WE BOWED AS PERFECT STRANGERS
OF THE FAILINGS OF MY SEX SHE LAUGHED GLANCING SHARPLY AT HER I SAW THAT HER EYES DID NOT WAVER IT IS TRUE I ONCE KNEW A WOMAN WHO PROVED FALSE AND INFAMOUS I REPLIED WITH SOME EMPHASIS
ALWAYS HE REPLIED SHAKING HIS HEAD SORROWFULLY I I CANNOT FORGET DICK'S POPULARITY STEADILY INCREASED LUCRATIVE COMMISSIONS POURED IN UPON HIM AND HE SETTLED DOWN TO SUCH HARD
THEREFORE I WAS ENABLED TO REMOVE THE GREATER PORTION OF IT WITH A SILK HANDKERCHIEF BUT I SAW WITH REGRET THAT THE TINTS OF THE FOREHEAD HAD BEEN IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED RENDERING THE PICTURE VALUELESS THE DAYS WENT BY
WHILE UPON THE TESSELATED PAVEMENT BEFORE THE DAIS PURPLE GRAPES AND YELLOW ROSES HAVE BEEN STREWN THE BLACK HAIR OF THE DAUGHTER OF PERSEIS FALLS IN PROFUSION ABOUT HER BARE SHOULDERS AND STRAYS OVER HER BREAST
AND SHE A THIRD RATE ACTRESS WHO HAD AN INGENUE PART AT A STRAND THEATRE
HER SATIN SLIPPERS WERE TRODDEN DOWN AT HEEL AND SHE HAD A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AT HER ELBOW AT THAT TIME HER LOVER GRANDILOQUENT AND IMPECUNIOUS MISTER HARRY ORANMORE A BAD BUT HANDSOME ACTOR HAD BEEN UNTRUE TO HER
A SCRAP OF CONVERSATION I OVERHEARD IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON HOWEVER CAUSED ME TO PONDER AN ELDERLY MAN EVIDENTLY A FOREIGNER WEARING THE VIOLET RIBBON OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY IN HIS BUTTONHOLE
HEARD SOME ONE PLAYING UPON MY PIANO AND A SWEET SOPRANO VOICE SINGING TROTERE'S IN OLD MADRID I RECOGNISED THE CLEAR TONES AS THOSE OF ETHEL AH HAROLD SHE CRIED JUMPING UP AS I ENTERED THE ROOM
AND THAT IT WAS STANDING IN A CORNER WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMING OVER WHEN THE LIGHT HAD FADED TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE AND DISCUSS ART AND LITERATURE WITH ME I WAS GLAD OF A CHAT AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AT MY WRITING TABLE BUT HIS COMPANIONSHIP HAD ONE DRAWBACK
I RETURNED HOME FROM A STROLL ACROSS KENSINGTON GARDENS
TEARS WELLED IN HER EYES SHE NODDED BUT DID NOT REPLY A DRY GREY DAY IN MARCH IT WAS SHOW SUNDAY THAT INSTITUTION IN THE ART WORLD WHEN THE PAINTER OPENS HIS STUDIO TO HIS FRIENDS AND THE PUBLIC
YOU SET YOUR FACE AGAINST ALL THE FAIR ONES BUT I SUCCEEDED IN TURNING THE CONVERSATION INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
FROM MORN TILL EVE ON SHOW SUNDAY CAMPDEN HILL IS ALWAYS BLOCKED BY THE CARRIAGES OF THE CURIOUS AND STUDIOS ARE BESIEGED BY FASHIONABLE CROWDS WHOSE CHATTER AND LAUGHTER MINGLES PLEASANTLY WITH THE CLINKING OF TEA CUPS
AND COULD LIVE NO LONGER DICK RARELY SMILES AND IS INVARIABLY GLOOMY AND SAD POOR FELLOW THE COUNT IGNORANT OF THE TRUTH HAS HUNG HIS LATEST PURCHASE
IS THAT THE WAY A WOMAN SHOWS HER AFFECTION HER HEAD WAS BOWED IN HUMILIATION FORGIVE ME HAROLD SHE SAID WITH INTENSE EARNESTNESS I ADMIT THAT I WRONGED YOU CRUELLY THAT I DISCARDED THE HONEST LOVE YOU GAVE ME
AS SHE GRASPED MY HAND AND LOOKED STEADILY INTO MY EYES NO I SAID STERNLY LAST NIGHT I TOLD YOU THAT A WOMAN HAD EMBITTERED MY LIFE THE WOMAN I REFERRED TO WAS YOURSELF AH
MAY BRING YOU FAME AND FORTUNE IS THE MOST SINCERE HOPE OF YOUR MODELS ETHEL I WARNED YOU AGAINST YOUR INFATUATION OLD FELLOW I SAID SERIOUSLY BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT I I LOVED HER
PROMISE TO KEEP MY SECRET FOR THE PRESENT I WILL PRESERVE SILENCE I ANSWERED MY HEART SOFTENING TOWARDS HER BUT I CANNOT PROMISE THAT I WILL NEVER TELL HIM
THE OPINIONS OF CRITICS WHO DROPPED IN WERE UNANIMOUS THAT IT WAS THE ARTIST'S MASTERPIECE AND THAT THE EXPRESSION AND GENERAL CONCEPTION WERE MARVELLOUS A VERDICT ENDORSED BY GUSHING SOCIETY WOMEN BORED CLUB MEN AND THE INANE JEUNESSE DOREE
WITH HER SHE HAD BROUGHT THE ODOUR OF VIOLETS THE SAME THAT I REMEMBERED YEARS AGO THE SAME PERFUME THAT ALWAYS STIRRED SAD MEMORIES WITHIN ME YOU DON'T WELCOME ME VERY WARMLY SHE SAID IN A DISAPPOINTED TONE
I WAS AMUSING MYSELF UNTIL YOUR RETURN I I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU WELL WHAT IS IT I ASKED RATHER SURPRISED CANNOT YOU GUESS DICK HAS ASKED ME TO BECOME HIS WIFE SHE SAID IN A LOW TONE
AND CONGRATULATED DICK WARMLY UPON HIS MASTERPIECE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE MEANT TO SECURE IT AT ANY COST
YET THE WILFUL OBLITERATION HAD UTTERLY SPOILED IT WHILE SITTING IN HIS STUDIO MUSING ONE DAY IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF THE FLAW UPON THE FOREHEAD COULD BE HIDDEN IT MIGHT AFTER ALL BE SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE
YOU SHALL SEE HER BEFORE LONG HIS GAZE GREW BRIGHT SOFT AND VAGUE AS ONE WHO CATCHES GLIMPSES OF THE FLOATING GARMENTS OF SUPERNATURAL MYSTERIES AH SHE IS LOVELY ONLY AN ARTIST CAN APPRECIATE HER BEAUTY
WHILE HIS FACE ASSUMED A HARD DETERMINED EXPRESSION
WAS PRONOUNCED ONE OF THE PICTURES OF THE YEAR THOUSANDS ADMIRED IT THE PAPERS WERE FULL OF LAUDATORY NOTICES BUT THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT UNAWARE OF THE FAME HE HAD SUDDENLY ACHIEVED WAS HIDING HIS SORROW SOMEWHERE IN THE VOSGES
I STROVE TO FORGET THE CLOCK HAD STRUCK TWO AND MY READING LAMP WAS BURNING LOW AND SPUTTERING WHEN I ROSE TO RETIRE FOR THE NIGHT I CONFESS THAT MY FRAME OF MIND SURPRISED ME INASMUCH AS I ACTUALLY FOUND MYSELF
PERFECTLY SATISFYING HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER AND LIFTED HER OUT OF HERSELF OUT OF THE WORLD EVEN WELCOME OLD FELLOW DICK CRIED
THAT EVENING I CALLED AT DICK'S HOUSE BUT WAS INFORMED BY HIS HOUSEKEEPER THAT HE HAD PACKED HIS BAG AND DEPARTED STATING THAT HE WOULD NOT RETURN FOR AT LEAST A MONTH PERHAPS LONGER WHEN I ENTERED THE STUDIO GLOOMY IN THE TWILIGHT
HAS NO SUCH ORDEAL TO FACE HE NEVER READS HIS NEW ROMANCE TO HIS FRIENDS NOR DO HIS WELL WISHERS APPLAUD IN ADVANCE REVIEWERS HAVE FIRST TILT AT ADVANCE COPIES AND VERY PROPERLY
I ASKED HESITATING TO RECEIVE IT I HAVE EARNED IT HONESTLY EVERY PENNY SHE REPLIED SINCE WE PARTED I HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN AMERICA AND PLAYED LEAD IN NEARLY ALL THE GREAT CITIES
THE THING'S IMPOSSIBLE I CRIED WARMLY I WILL NOT ALLOW IT YOU MAY BE FRIENDS BUT HE SHALL NEVER MARRY YOU HOW CRUEL YOU ARE SHE SAID WITH A TOUCH OF SADNESS BUT AFTER ALL YOUR APPREHENSIONS ARE GROUNDLESS
HEEDLESS OF EVERYTHING UNDER THE SPELL SHE HAD CAST ABOUT HIM ONE NIGHT NOT LONG AFTER I HAD EXPRESSED MY SENTIMENTS TO HIM REGARDING HIS INFATUATION I ENTERED HIS STUDIO AND FOUND HIS GODDESS SEATED BY THE FIRE WITH HER SHAPELY FEET UPON THE FENDER
METHODICAL WORK THAT I BEGAN TO THINK HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE WOMAN WHO HAD ENMESHED HIM WITH BEAMING FACE HE CAME TO ME ONE SUMMER'S MORNING AND ANNOUNCED THAT ALTHOUGH THE COMMITTEE OF THE CHANTREY BEQUEST HAD OFFERED TO PURCHASE THE MASKED CIRCE HE
BUT SHE SCARCELY HEEDED ME PROBABLY SHE WAS THINKING OF ORANMORE FOR SHE CLASPED HER SLIM FINGERS ROUND HER SUFFERING THROAT AND OFFERED UP AN OCCASIONAL SOB FOLLOWING IT WITH A SILENT BUT PROTRACTED DRAUGHT FROM HER GLASS
TO INQUIRE AFTER THE COUNTESS'S HEALTH THE FOOTMAN LOOKED PALE AND GRAVE WHEN I ASKED AFTER HER LADYSHIP I MUCH REGRET TO INFORM YOU SIR THAT MY MISTRESS IS DEAD HE SAID
I AM GOING FAR AWAY WHERE YOU CANNOT FIND ME IT WAS FOOLISH FOR US TO HAVE LOVED THEREFORE FORGET ME THAT YOU MAY MEET SOME ONE FAR WORTHIER THAN MYSELF
AND PLACED IT UPON THE BLOTTING PAD BEFORE ME THE GIRL HE LOVED BAH I KNEW HER THOUGH I DID NOT TELL HIM SO SHE WAS A DARK HAIRED PINK AND WHITE BEAUTY THAT FLITTED THROUGH ARTISTIC BOHEMIA LIKE A BUTTERFLY IN A HOTHOUSE
THEN I LIT MY PIPE AND ONE BY ONE READ THEM THROUGH PAUSING AND PONDERING OVER THE DECLARATIONS OF PASSIONATE LOVE THEY CONTAINED FAR INTO THE NIGHT I SAT REVIEWING THE ROMANCE OF BYGONE DAYS UNTIL I CAME TO THE LAST LETTER
ON THIS OCCASION AS ON PREVIOUS ONES I ASSISTED DICK TO RECEIVE HIS VISITORS BUT UNFORTUNATELY ETHEL HAD BEEN TAKEN SUDDENLY UNWELL AND COULD NOT ATTEND MY ANTICIPATIONS PROVED CORRECT
HE WAS SUCH A LARGE HEARTED HONEST FELLOW THAT I FELT QUITE PAINED WHEN I ANTICIPATED THE AWAKENING THAT MUST INEVITABLY COME SOONER OR LATER HE KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF HER PAST AND WAS QUITE IGNORANT THAT SHE HAD BEEN A POPULAR ACTRESS
AND THAT WITHIN A YEAR I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SITTING BEFORE THE FOOTLIGHTS WATCHING HER MAKE HER DEBUT AS LEADING LADY AT A WEST END THEATRE AND A FEW DAYS LATER OF OBSERVING HER PHOTOGRAPH EXHIBITED IN SHOP WINDOWS AMONG THOSE OF OTHER STAGE BEAUTIES
AND WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE OPENING DAY WHEN I EXPERIENCED THE MINGLED SURPRISE AND SATISFACTION OF SEEING IT HUNG UPON THE LINE
THE MASK SEEMED TO INCREASE THE RECKLESS DIABLERIE OF ITS WEARER AND ENHANCE THE FAIRNESS OF THE COMPLEXION WHILE IT ADDED AN AIR OF MYSTERY NOT AT ALL UNPLEASING TO THE EYE A FEW DAYS LATER I DISPATCHED IT TO THE ACADEMY
AND WHEN I DID SO I DISCOVERED TO MY DISMAY THAT IN HIS FRENZY OF MAD DESPAIR
I WILL BE TRUE TO HIM IF HE MARRIES ME HE SHALL NEVER HAVE CAUSE FOR REGRET NEVER SUPPOSE I TOLD HIM WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF YOU YOU WILL NOT SHE CRIED CLINGING TO ME YOU ARE TOO HONOURABLE FOR THAT
ENABLED ME TO PAINT IN THE HALF LIGHTS UPON THE BLACK SILK AND THE LAUGHING EYES BEING FORTUNATELY INTACT I ALLOWED THEM TO PEER THROUGH THE APERTURES THE EFFECT PRODUCED WAS STARTLING
AT DISCOVERING HIS IDOL ALREADY MARRIED RETURNED AT ONCE TO LONDON WHILE I REMAINED AT AN INN AT OXTED IN ORDER TO GLEAN SOME FURTHER INFORMATION INQUIRIES SHOWED THAT THE COUNT HAD MET HER WHILE TRAVELLING IN AMERICA
THE WELL KNOWN ANGLO ITALIAN MILLIONAIRE AND ART PATRON SAYING THAT HE DESIRED TO BUY IT AND ASKING HIM TO GO DOWN TO OXTED PARK HIS SEAT IN SURREY TO ARRANGE THE PRICE I AM GOING TO DAY HE SAID YOU MASKED HER
THE DELICATE TINTS OF THE NECK AND ARMS WERE REPRODUCED WITH A SKILL THAT BETRAYED THE MASTER HAND
GIVE HIM A VERBAL DRUBBING I DID SO BUT HE BIT HIS MOUSTACHE FIERCELY AND TURNED UPON ME SHE IS CHARMING HE SAID AND I LOVE HER AH I KNOW THE TYPE
STILL LOVING HER GOOD AFTERNOON I HOPE I DON'T DISTURB YOU LOOKING UP FROM MY WORK I SAW ETHEL NOT AT ALL PRAY SIT DOWN I SAID COLDLY
TAKING IT UP I EXAMINED IT MINUTELY IN THE LIGHT THE IDEA OF PLACING A HALF MASK UPON THE FACE SUGGESTED ITSELF AND WITHOUT DELAY I PROCEEDED TO CARRY IT INTO EFFECT
I CAUGHT HER GLANCING FURTIVELY AT ME UNDER HER LONG LASHES SHE HAD GROWN EVEN HANDSOMER THAN WHEN LAST I HAD SEEN HER AND WAS THE PICTURE OF THE ROMANTIC BOHEMIENNE HER DRESS WAS OF BLACK GAUZE THROUGH WHICH THE MILKY WHITENESS OF HER FIGURE SEEMED TO SHINE
IN SURPRISE I GLANCED UP FROM MY WORK OF ROMANCE WEAVING ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND SAW DICK PALE AND AGITATED STANDING AT MY ELBOW THE LETTER HE PLACED BEFORE ME WAS IN A WOMAN'S HAND AND EMITTED THE FAINTEST BREATH OF VIOLETS
AND EXPLANATION AND WE LEFT THE COUNT WHO KNEELING BESIDE HIS WIFE AND ENDEAVOURING TO RESUSCITATE HER WAS COMPLETELY MYSTIFIED AT THE STRANGE RECOGNITION DICK ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF WITH GRIEF
IT SEEMS THAT THE PUBLIC ADMIRE HER AS MUCH AS I HAVE DONE I I SHALL FIND HER SOME DAY THEN SHE WILL RETURN TO ME STILL THINKING OF HER I OBSERVED REPROACHFULLY YES ALWAYS
BUT HER FEATURES ARE HIDDEN BY A HALF MASK OF BLACK SILK THE LIPS WITH THEIR ARC DE CUPIDON ARE SLIGHTLY PARTED DISCLOSING AN EVEN ROW OF PEARLY TEETH
MOTIONING HER TO AN ARMCHAIR TO WHAT DO I OWE THE HONOUR OF THIS VISIT SHE PULLED OFF HER LONG GLOVES AND LET HER SEALSKIN CAPE FALL AT HER FEET WHILE I PUT DOWN MY PEN AND RISING STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE FIRE
HE CONTRACTED TYPHOID WHILE WE WERE PLAYING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IT TERMINATED FATALLY ETHEL I SAID GRAVELY TAKING HER HAND IN MINE YOU HAVE FASCINATED DICK CARRUTHERS MY FRIEND
WOMAN'S VANITY OFTEN OUTRUNS HER NATURAL DIFFIDENCE AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER GREAT BEAUTY STIFLES THE CONSCIENCE OF MODESTY VISITORS TO THE ACADEMY KNOW THE PICTURE CIRCE SEATED
WITH HER BACK TO A GREAT CIRCULAR MIRROR PRESENTS A HALF DRAPED FIGURE OF MARVELLOUS DELICATE COLOURING AND BEAUTY OF OUTLINE ONE HAND HOLDS ALOFT A GOLDEN WINE GOBLET AND THE OTHER A TAPERING WAND
WHAT CHARACTER DO YOU THINK WOULD BEST SUIT ME WELL
AND YOU AVENGE YOURSELF BY REVILING ALL OF US IT IS REALLY TOO BAD SHE SAID POUTING LIKE A SPOILED CHILD BY JOVE OLD FELLOW DICK CHIMED IN DO TELL US ABOUT YOUR ROMANCE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW THE REASON
OF THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE GAZED UPON IT IN ADMIRATION NONE KNOWS THE SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE STORY CONNECTED WITH IT AS I HAVE BEEN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH IT FROM THE DAY IT WAS OUTLINED IN CHARCOAL
I HAVE BEEN ALMOST RUINED THINK OF YOUR ACTIONS ON THE DAY BEFORE YOU LEFT ME HOW YOU TOOK FROM THAT DRAWER A SIGNED BLANK CHEQUE WITH WHICH YOU DREW SIX HUNDRED POUNDS NEARLY ALL THE MONEY I POSSESSED AND THEN FLED WITH YOUR LOVER
THE SIGHT OF THE PICTURED FACE BROUGHT BACK TO ME THE MEMORY OF DAYS LONG PAST OF A CLOSED CHAPTER IN MY LIFE'S HISTORY I REMEMBERED THE FIRST TIME I SAW ETHEL BROUGHTON FULLY FIVE YEARS BEFORE SHE WORE A SOILED PINK WRAPPER
BUT YOU YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW WEAK WE WOMEN ARE WHEN TEMPTATION IS IN OUR PATH CANNOT I NOW MAKE AMENDS I SHOOK MY HEAD SADLY
AND SHE WAVED THE GOBLET SHE WAS HOLDING ABOVE HER HEAD YOUR POSE IS PERFECT DEAR PLEASE DON'T ALTER IT URGED THE ARTIST WHO ADVANCING TO HIS EASEL AGAIN CONTINUED THE FREE RAPID OUTLINE
IN ILLUSTRATING MY ARTICLES AND STORIES IN VARIOUS MAGAZINES HE IS A POPULAR PAINTER AND AS HANDSOME A MAN AS EVER HAD A PICTURE ON THE LINE THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE PROLOGUE OF THIS SECRET DRAMA WAS ENACTED
JUST AS ARSENIC DOES IN A CORPSE WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT DICK CARRUTHERS WAS WASTING THE VERY HONEST AND ARDENT EMOTIONS OF HIS HEART AT THIS FEVERISH FAIRY'S SHRINE I RESOLVED TO TAKE HIM ASIDE AND WITHOUT ADMITTING THAT I KNEW HER
HE DRIVELLED OVER A GIRL HE LOVED AND WAS FOREVER SUGGESTING THAT I MIGHT TAKE HER AS A CHARACTER AND DRAG HER INTO THE NOVEL UPON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED ONE DAY HE DREW A CABINET PHOTOGRAPH CAREFULLY FROM HIS POCKET
TO SHOW THEM THE PICTURE HE IS ABOUT TO SEND TO THE ACADEMY THE EXHIBITION IS IN MANY INSTANCES BUT THE SHOWING BEFOREHAND OF THE GARLANDS OF VICTORY IN A BATTLE WHICH IS DOOMED TO BE LOST FOR WHEN THE OPENING DAY COMES
AH HERE'S THE COUNTESS EXCLAIMED THE MILLIONAIRE STEPPING FORWARD TO INTRODUCE US WE TURNED AND SAW A PALE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ATTIRED IN A HANDSOME DINNER GOWN ETHEL YOU
WHENEVER HE PAID FLYING VISITS TO LONDON HOWEVER HE ALWAYS LOOKED ME UP BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH NEVER MENTIONED ETHEL NEVERTHELESS I ASCERTAINED THAT THEY FREQUENTLY MET
THE WOMAN WHO BROKE MEN'S HEARTS I REPLIED MISCHIEVOUSLY EXCELLENT I SHALL BE ABLE TO ASSUME THAT CHARACTER WELL SHE SAID WITH A GRIM SMILE I WILL TELL HIM SPRING CAME AND WENT
AT THE CLOSE OF A BLUE SUMMER'S DAY WHEN THE DREAMY GOLDEN HAZE WRAPPED THE CITY IN A MYSTIC CHARM I CALLED AT THE STUDIO HAVING HEARD THAT HE HAD RETURNED AND WAS SETTLING DOWN TO WORK WHEN I ENTERED DICK WAS STANDING BEFORE HIS EASEL
THE RESULT OF THIS INTERVIEW WAS BUT NATURAL DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY I SYMPATHISED WITH HER ENDEAVOURED TO CHEER HER AND CONCLUDED BY FALLING VIOLENTLY IN LOVE WITH HER AT THAT TIME I WAS WRITING NUMBERS OF DRAMATIC CRITICISMS
NEVERTHELESS YOU WILL BE ALWAYS REMEMBERED BY YOURS UNWORTHILY ETHEL BITTER MEMORIES OF THE PAST OVERWHELMED ME BUT AT LAST GROWING IMPATIENT AND TOSSING THE LETTERS BACK INTO THE DRAWER
PIPE IN MOUTH AND CRAYON IN HAND BUSILY SKETCHING WHILE ON THE RAISED THRONE BEFORE HIM SAT ETHEL RADIANT AND BEAUTIFUL A TENDER SMILE PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT SEEMED AS THOUGH A HAPPINESS FULL COMPLETE
IF IF HE SPEAKS TO YOU URGE HIM TO ABANDON THOUGHTS OF LOVE AND REGARD ME AS A FRIEND ONLY YOU ARE AT LEAST SENSIBLE ETHEL I SAID IT IS GRATIFYING TO KNOW THAT YOU RECOGNISE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN UNION
IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED I VISITED THE STUDIO ALMOST DAILY AND WATCHED THE GROWTH OF THE PICTURE
EXCLAIMED THE OLD MAN EVIDENTLY RECOGNISING THE FEATURES THE PICTURE IS INDEED MAGNIFICENT
IT HAS BEEN OFTEN REMARKED THAT COPERNICUS AND KEPLER AND NEWTON HAVE DESTROYED ALL THE OLD MYTHOLOGIES INCLUDING OF COURSE THE MYTHOLOGY OF BOTH THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS WITH THE EARTH NO LONGER THE UNIVERSE OF MORTAL LIFE
AND MY DEEP REVERENCE FOR RABELAIS WITH WHOM NO COMMENTATOR IN HOLY ORDERS KNOWN TO ME CAN BE COMPARED EXCEPT DEAN SWIFT I AM INCLINED ON THIS POINT TO FOLLOW THE ORDINARY OPINION THAT PAN THE GREAT GOD WHOSE DEATH WAS THUS
THE GOOD PANTAGRUEL GOES ON TO EXPOUND THE STORY AFTER HIS OWN MANNER THINKING THAT IT REFERRED NOT TO THE HEATHEN GOD PAN BUT TO OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST IGNOMINIOUSLY PUT TO DEATH
AS TO THE LETTER IMMENSE AS TO THE SPIRIT FOR THE SENSE IS A TRUTH OR TRUISM OF HIS OWN LOWER SPHERE
I MUST AVOW THAT TO MY MIND THE DECOMPOSITION OF CHRISTIANITY IS SO OFFENSIVELY MANIFEST AND ADVANCED THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
I HAVE A VISION OF THE GOD MAN GETTING OLD UPON THE EARTH HORRIBLY ANXIOUS AND WRETCHED BECAUSE NO ONE WILL MURDER HIM JUDAS HAS SUCCEEDED TO A LARGE PROPERTY AND WOULD NOT BE TEMPTED TO BETRAY HIM BY THREE HUNDRED PIECES OF SILVER
BUT THE WORLD EVEN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNGRATEFUL TO ITS MOST GENEROUS BENEFACTORS IS IT NOT THE WORST OF SACRILEGE A FOUL PROFANATION OF OUR HUMAN NATURE
LIVES IN THE RELATIVE AND THE CONDITIONED AND NATURALLY REFLECTS THE CHARACTER OF THIS SPHERE THE WISE MAN FINDS HIMSELF SURROUNDED AND OBSTRUCTED BY CERTAIN CONCRETE ERRORS
AND WHO THOUGH VALIANTLY DEFYING SCIENCE SEEKS TO CONCILIATE HISTORICAL POSSIBILITY FINDS HIS TASK QUITE HEAVY ENOUGH IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE FACTS
THE UNSOULING OF NATURE BOUND IN IRON CHAINS BY ARID NUMBER AND RIGOROUS RULE BUT GOES ON TO CELEBRATE THE RESURRECTION OF HUMANITY IN CHRIST
THE CHRISTIAN MYTHOLOGY AND SYSTEM AMONG OTHERS BECAUSE INEFFABLY ABSURD WHERE IS THE HEAVEN FOR ITS GOD WHERE THE HELL FOR ITS DEVIL WHERE IS ABOVE WHERE BENEATH
CONDEMNING IT OFFHAND AS TOO PREPOSTEROUS TO BE WORTHY OF SERIOUS ATTENTION THUS WHAT CHRISTIAN HAS EVER DEIGNED TO EXAMINE CRITICALLY THE MARVELS AFFIRMED IN THE KORAN SUCH AS MOHAMMED'S VISIT TO HEAVEN
NOW THAT THE OPPRESSION OF THE SUPERNATURAL IS REMOVED I MAY BE TOLD THAT CHRISTIANITY IS YET ALIVE AND FLOURISHING THAT ITS PRIESTHOOD AND ITS CHURCHES HOLD POSSESSION OF EUROPE AND AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA
HIS WORDS AS REPORTED BY THE EVANGELISTS ARE EVER FLOWING FOUNTAINS OF SPIRITUAL REFRESHMENTS AND I FEEL THAT HE WAS IN HIMSELF EVEN FAR MORE WISE AND GOOD THAN HE APPEARS IN THE GOSPEL
AND DEITY REPORTS THE SPEECHES ALL SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE TRUTH TRANSPARENTLY SELF CONSISTENT ELSE WHAT ADVANTAGE OR GAIN HAVE WE BY THE SUBSTITUTION OF GOD FOR MAN
WE DON'T THINK TWICE BEFORE DETERMINING WHETHER THE IMPOSSIBLE EVER REALLY OCCURRED HOW THEN CAN THIS ENLIGHTENED PROTESTANT RECEIVE WITHOUT QUESTION THE MIRACLES OF THE JEWISH BOOKS
GODS OF GREECE AFTER DECLARING IN HIS WILD WAY THAT HE HAS NEVER LOVED THE OLD DEITIES THAT TO HIM THE GREEK ARE REPUGNANT AND THE ROMANS THOROUGHLY HATEFUL YET
AND WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM EVEN PETER WON'T DENY HIM ALTHOUGH HE HAS RESTORED PETER'S MOTHER IN LAW TO LIFE THE SITUATION IS DESPERATE
IS NO MORE ALIVE THAN PLUTO WHO ALSO WAS BORN BROTHER TO THE MONARCH OF HEAVEN THE HEBREW DYNASTY OF THE GODS IS NO MORE IT HAS DONE MUCH EVIL IN ITS LONG SOVRANTY
HE CURED MANY SICK IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT GIVE THE WHOLE WORLD HEALTH HE ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLICANS AND SINNERS IF GOD WHY DID HE MAKE PUBLICANS AND SINNERS AT ALL
BUT PAN THE GREAT LIVES AGAIN AS MISTER MACCALL TOLD US IN SOME LINES PUBLISHED IN THIS PAPER SEVERAL YEARS AGO PAN LIVES NOT AS A GOD BUT AS THE ALL NATURE
THIS WORLD AND LIFE WERE CONTEMNED FOR THE LIFE AND WORLD TO COME NATURE THE ALL THE GREAT PAN WAS ANNULLED AND THE SUPERNATURAL NOTHING THRONED SUPREME
IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT REVEAL IT AT ONCE TO ALL MEN AND SO REVEAL IT THAT DOUBT HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE HE LIVED AN EXAMPLE OF HOLINESS TO US ALL IF GOD
AND THE WHOLE OF JERUSALEM AND COMPEL THEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND BEAR ENDURING WITNESS TO HIS RESURRECTION WHY DID HE NOT SUMMON ALL THE PEOPLE FROM THE HIGHEST TO THE LOWEST TO THE SOLEMN SPECTACLE OF HIS ASCENSION
IT IS FULL TIME TO PROCLAIM THE DEATH OF THE GREAT GOD CHRIST EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS MAKE A FAIRLY LONG PERIOD EVEN FOR A CELESTIAL DYNASTY BUT THIS ONE IN ITS PERISHING
IS VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT NEITHER IN THE ACTS NOR IN THE EPISTLES IS THERE ANY ALLUSION TO THESE RESURRECTIONS WHEN PETER AND THE OTHERS WERE PREACHING THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
WHEN WE FIND SENTENCES OF THE PUREST BEAUTY AND WISDOM IN THE RECORDS OF A MAN'S CONVERSATION WE MAY SAFELY PROPORTION THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHICAL CHARACTER OF THE SPEAKER TO SUCH SENTENCES THEY MARK THE ALTITUDE
NAY WHAT BIBLIOLATER HAS EVER SERIOUSLY WEIGHED THE EVIDENCE FOR THE MIRACLES OF HIS FELLOW CHRISTIAN THE GREAT SAINT BERNARD SUCH AS THOSE WHICH ARE MINUTELY RELATED AND SOLEMNLY ATTESTED BY TEN EYE WITNESSES
WE FIND THAT THERE WERE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY GATHERED AFTER THE ASCENSION WITHOUT THE PRIESTS AND THE ROMAN OFFICIALS HEARING OF THE APPARITION AND INVESTIGATING IT
IF ALL THESE TURPITUDES HAD NOT BEEN SECURED THE ATONEMENT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONSUMMATED NEED ONE SAY MORE SOMETIMES WHEN MUSING UPON THIS DOCTRINE
TO WHOM MIRACLES APPEARED AMONG THE MOST FREQUENT OCCURRENCES OF LIFE SO COULD THE ASCENSION THEIR EARTH WAS A PLANE VAULTED BY THE SKY LAMPED BY THE LITTLE SUN AND MOON AND STARS
WHICH WE WILL TRY TO FORGET NOW IT CEASES TO REIGN IT HAS DONE SOME LITTLE GOOD WHOSE REMEMBRANCE WE WILL CHERISH WHEN IT IS SEPULCHRED CHRIST THE GREAT IS DEAD
BY THE MONSTROUS SUPERSTITION OF THAT BALEFUL ERA AS WE FIND THE HOOFS AND HORNS OF PAN TRANSFERRED TO THE DEVIL HIMSELF AS WE FIND VENUS
FATE IN THE FORM OF SCIENCE HAS DECREED THE EXTINCTION OF THE GODS MARY AND HER BABE MUST JOIN VENUS AND LOVE ISIS AND HORUS LIVING WITH THEM ONLY IN THE WORLD OF ART
HE FEELS READY TO FIGHT FOR THE FORMER AGAINST THESE THIS CHANGE OF THE CELESTIAL DYNASTY IS INDEED A FAVORITE THEME WITH HIM ELSEWHERE HE PICTURES THE OLYMPIANS HOLDING HIGH REVELRY
WE HAVE ALL HEARD THE WONDERFUL STORY RECOUNTED BY PLUTARCH IN HIS TREATISE ON THE CESSATION OF THE ORACLES HOW
HAVE PERHAPS BEEN DEGRADED BY THE REPORTER
MOST GREAT PAN OUR ONLY SAVIOR DIED AT JERUSALEM REIGNING IN ROME TIBERIUS CAESAR PANTAGRUEL THESE WORDS SAID RESTED IN SILENCE AND PROFOUND CONTEMPLATION
FOR AGES ALREADY THE HOLY GHOST HAS BEEN BUT THE SHADOW OF A SHADE AND THE LAST NOT LEAST MEMBER OF THE DIVINE ROYAL FAMILY SATAN THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS
AS WE ARE LEARNING TO KNOW IT NOW TRY TO CONCEIVE AN INFINITE AND ETERNAL GOD OF THIS INFINITE AND ETERNAL WHOLE SACRIFICING HIS ONLY SON FOR THE SALVATION OF US MOST INSIGNIFICANT INSECTS
BY THE ENVY AND INIQUITY OF THE PONTIFFS DOCTORS PRESBYTERS AND MONKS OF THE MOSAIC DISPENSATION FOR WITH GOOD RIGHT MAY HE IN THE GREEK TONGUE BE CALLED PAN SEEING THAT HE IS OUR ALL ALL WE ARE
WE ARE SURELY AT THE UTMOST LIMITS OF THE POSSIBLE IN CONCEIVING THAT JESUS COULD APPEAR UNTO FIVE HUNDRED OF THE BRETHREN AT ONCE THERE IS NO HINT ELSEWHERE THAT HE HAD SO MANY PERMANENT FOLLOWERS IN HIS LIFETIME
THE VOICE GROWN YET LOUDER AND MORE TERRIBLE
WHY BRING IN GOD TO UTTER AND RECORD WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN AS WELL UTTERED AND RECORDED BY MAN EVERYTHING FOR WHICH WE LOVE AND VENERATE THE MAN JESUS BECOMES A BITTER AND ABSURD MOCKERY WHEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE LORD CHRIST
I CAN NO LONGER GIVE MY ESTEEM TO ANY EDUCATED MAN WHO HAS INVESTIGATED AND STILL PROFESSES THIS RELIGION WITHOUT GRAVE DEDUCTION AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS HEART HIS INTELLECT OR HIS CONSCIENCE
AND THE CHARACTER WHEREIN IT HAS BEEN FOUNDED TAKING AWAY ALL TRUE GRANDEUR FROM JESUS BENUMBING OUR LOVE AND REVERENCE JESUS AS A MAN COMMANDS MY HEART'S BEST HOMAGE
AND SINCE HE DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO WEIGH EVIDENCE BEFORE EITHER ACCEPTING OR REJECTING THOUGH HE MAY SEEK EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT TO CONFIRM WHAT HE HAS ALREADY GIVEN HIMSELF TO BELIEVE
YOUR ENLIGHTENED PROTESTANT SIMPLY SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS AT ALL SUCH STORIES AND SAYS WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE OF COURSE MERE IMPOSTURE AND COLLUSION OR SUPERSTITION AND DELUSION
AT WHICH HIS SPIRIT LOVED TO DWELL WE ARE BUT COMPLETING THE CIRCLE FROM THE CLEAREST FRAGMENT ARC LEFT
MIRACULOUSLY ANNOUNCED WAS THE PAN OF THE HEATHEN GREEKS CHRIST HAD DIED BUT ONLY PRO TEM HAD DESCENDED INTO HELL BUT WITH A RETURN TICKET
AND AT INCONCEIVABLE DISTANCES FROM IT WITH MAN NO LONGER THE LORD OF THE CREATION FOR WHOSE SERVICE ALL THINGS WERE MADE BUT AN ANIMALCULE INEXPRESSIBLY SMALL LIVING FOR A MOMENT INEXPRESSIBLY BRIEF
THE HEAVENLY TRINITY WOULD NOT HAVE TRIUMPHED IN THE SCHEME OF SALVATION BY ATONEMENT JUDAS CAIAPHAS
ALWAYS ALTERS YEAR AFTER YEAR AS MUCH AS THE MAN HIMSELF ALTERS FOR HE CONTINUES GRAFTING HIS OWN SENSE WHICH MAY BE DEPLORABLE NONSENSE UPON WORDS WHICH HAVE BEEN SPOKEN
AND THE GRAVES WERE OPENED AND MANY BODIES OF THE SAINTS WHICH SLEPT AROSE AND CAME OUT OF THEIR GRAVES AFTER HIS RESURRECTION AND WENT INTO THE HOLY CITY AND APPEARED UNTO MANY
BUT WHEN HE HEARS WORDS WHICH TO HIM ARE WITHOUT SENSE BECAUSE THEY EXPRESS SOME TRUTH WHOSE SPHERE IS BEYOND THE REACH OF HIS VISION HE MAKES SENSE OF THEM BY SOME SLIGHT CHANGE SLIGHT
THEIR CHRIST STANDING IN THE FLESH ON THE MOUNT OF OLIVES FLOATED UP THROUGH THIS VAULT TO SIT ENTHRONED BESIDE HIS FATHER IN THE MOST NATURAL SUPERNATURAL MANNER
AND THE REAL WE ACCEPT PERFORCE IN ITS FULNESS BUT DISCERN NOT HOW IT CAN DERIVE FROM AN UNREAL GOD NOVALIS IN HIS HYMNS TO THE NIGHT LAMENTS WITH SCHILLER
AND ELSEWHERE HAS BEWAILED THE DEAD IMMORTALS WITH NOTHING BUT AVERSION AND CONTEMPT FOR THE PALE GALILEAN THE GHASTLY GLORIES OF SAINTS DEAD LIMBS OF GIBBETED GODS
IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT RESTORE MANKIND TO HIMSELF WITHOUT DYING AND WHAT GREAT THING WAS IT TO SEEM TO DIE FOR THREE DAYS HE SENT APOSTLES TO PREACH SALVATION TO ALL MEN
I AM CONTENT TO NOTE ONE ASPECT OF THIS UNFORTUNATE MYSTERY WHICH SO FAR AS I AM AWARE HAS BEEN SELDOM STUDIED THE WHOLE SCHEME OF THE ATONEMENT AS PLANNED BY GOD IS BASED UPON A CRIME
BEAUTIFUL BUT NOT OF HIS DEEPEST REGRETS THE BANISHED DIVINITIES AND SINCE THE HALLS OF OLYMPUS ARE VOID APPEALS TO NATURE TO RESTORE TO HIS SPIRIT ITS FIRST FIRE IF SHE INDEED LIVES
IN HIS INCOMPARABLE GODS IN EXILE HE TELLS US WHAT BECAME OF THESE DISPERSED OLYMPIANS DURING THE DARK AGES IN THE THICK NIGHT OF THE NOONTIDE OF CHRISTIANITY HOW THEY WERE TRANSFORMED FROM CELESTIAL TO INFERNAL
HIS BROW BLEEDING FROM A CROWN OF THORNS TRAILING ON HIS SHOULDER A HEAVY CROSS WHICH HE HEAVES UPON THE BANQUET TABLE AND FORTHWITH THE REVEL IS NO MORE
THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS THINK HIM INSANE AND THEREFORE AS ORIENTALS HOLD HIM IN A CERTAIN REVERENCE
HE IS ROLLING OFF ON THE RIGHT YOU PUSH HIM UP HE THEN ROLLS OVER ON THE LEFT EXACTLY SO AND BECAUSE ONE SAGE SEEING HIM ROLL DOWN TO THE RIGHT HAS PUSHED HIM UP ON THE RIGHT WHILE ANOTHER SAGE
A VERY FEW PERSONS WHOSE TRANSCENDENT GENIUS COULD THROW A GLAMOR OF GLORY OVER ANY CREED HOWEVER CRUDE AND MEAN AND WHOM I RECOGNISE AS FAR ABOVE MY JUDGMENT
ONLY FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT ITSELF I CONFINED MYSELF TO SHOWING OR ATTEMPTING TO SHOW THAT SUCH EVIDENCE IS UNSUBSTANTIAL BUT I COULD NOT CONSIDER THIS ARGUMENT ADEQUATE OR CONCLUSIVE
WHILE REJECTING WITHOUT QUESTION ALL OTHERS WE HAVE SEEN THAT IT CANNOT BE BECAUSE OF ANY SUPERIORITY OF EVIDENCE FOR THE FORMER SINCE THE EVIDENCE FOR THE LATTER IS IN MANY CASES INFINITELY GREATER AND BETTER AUTHENTICATED
SEEING HIM ROLL DOWN TO THE LEFT HAS PUSHED HIM UP ON THE LEFT ARE THE TWO SAGES TO BE ACCOUNTED ANTAGONISTS NOW AS A WISE MAN IN THE COURSE OF HIS EXISTENCE MEETS ERRORS OF MANY SORTS
WHEN THE NOBLEST HEARTS WORSHIP NOT AT ITS ALTARS WHEN THE MOST VIGOROUS INTELLECTS ABANDON ITS CREEDS THE KNELL OF ITS DOOM HAS RUNG AT THE RISK OF BEING THOUGHT BIGOTED OR PREJUDICED
ONCE IN THE IMPERIAL ARCHIVES THE RECORD OF THE MIRACLE WOULD HAVE SPREAD EVERYWHERE ALL SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS WOULD HAVE RELATED IT ALL SUBSEQUENT WRITERS REFERRED TO IT SO IT IS NO WONDER THAT
WERE RECORDED OF ANY OTHER THAN JESUS IN ANY OTHER SACRED BOOK THAN THE BIBLE MISTER HUTTON AND ALL OTHER INTELLIGENT CHRISTIANS WOULD NOT ONLY DISBELIEVE IT BUT WOULD NOT EVEN CONDESCEND TO INVESTIGATE IT
HAD HE LIVED IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES FOR A WISE MAN ONLY ATTACKS THE ERRORS THAT ARE IN HIS WAY THINGS WHICH HE NEVER MEETS HE CAN SCARCELY THINK OF AS OBSTRUCTIONS
THAT PAN THE GREAT WAS DEAD ACCORDINGLY WHEN THE VESSEL REACHED THIS PLACE
WHAT DISCIPLE COULD BE EXPECTED TO REPORT PERFECTLY THE WORDS OF A TEACHER SO MYSTICALLY SUBLIME THE DISCIPLE INTENDS AND ENDEAVORS TO REPORT FAITHFULLY
AND WHEN THE REPORTS ARE NOT PUT INTO WRITING UNTIL MANY YEARS AFTER THE WORDS WERE FIRST UTTERED THE CHANGES WILL BE IMPORTANT EVEN AS TO THE LETTER FOR A NARRATIVE
THE POETS HAVE CHANTED THIS MOMENTOUS REVOLUTION ACCORDING TO THEIR RELIGION THEIR PHANTASY OR THEIR MOOD MILTON IN HIS HYMN ON THE NATIVITY
ONE IS ASHAMED OF REPEATING THESE THINGS FOR THE TEN THOUSANDTH TIME BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO BE REPEATED OCCASIONALLY
JESUS AS A MAN WHOSE WORDS HAVE BEEN RECORDED BY FALLIBLE MEN IS NOT LOWERED IN MY ESTEEM BY SUCH CONTRADICTIONS AS I FIND BETWEEN HIS VARIOUS SPEECHES EVERY PROVERB
TO A HISTORY WHOSE CHRONOLOGY COUNTS NOT SIX THOUSAND YEARS BUT AS I HAVE REMARKED EVEN THIS MINUTE FIELD THEY CANNOT HOLD AGAINST THE SCEPTIC WHO HAS MADE THEM ABANDON ALL THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE
IT ASSERTS THAT HUMAN NATURE COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE SO GOOD AS JESUS THAT HUMAN GENIUS COULD NOT POSSIBLY WRITE THE BOOKS WHICH TELL OF HIM IT DENIES US OUR NOBLEST PREROGATIVES
BETWEEN A HEAVEN ABOVE ITS DOMED FIRMAMENT AND A HADES LIKE A VAST DUNGEON BENEATH BUT A QUITE INFINITESIMAL GRAIN OF SAND INVOLVED BY AN INFINITESIMAL DROP OF DEW
NATURALLY THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS HATED AND RESISTED SCIENCE AND THE THEOLOGIANS HAVE SELDOM DARED TO FACE ITS CONCLUSIONS THEY IGNORE THE IMMENSITIES AND CONFINE THEIR VISION TO THE PAGES OF A SINGLE BOOK
SHOUTS HARSH PURITANICAL SCORN ON THE ORACLES STRICKEN DUMB AND THE DEITIES OVERTHROWN SHELLEY IN A MAGNIFICENT CHORUS OF HELLAS
WE ARE WHAT WE ARE BUT MUCH MATTERS TO WHAT WE MAY ATTAIN IF THE DEVELOPMENT THEORY PLANTS OUR FEET IN THE SLIME THE CHRISTIAN THEORY BOWS OUR HEAD TO THE DUST
WHOSE VISIBLE TANGIBLE LIVING AND SPEAKING EVIDENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESISTIBLE JUST AS THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS COULD BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT MISGIVING BY THE NON SCIENTIFIC EARLY CHRISTIANS
MAY HE BE COMPELLED TO COMMIT SUICIDE MUST HE GO BACK TO HEAVEN UNSACRIFICED FOILED FOR WANT OF AN ASSASSIN BENJAMIN DISRAELI ATTAINED THE CYNICAL SUBLIME WHEN HE SUGGESTED
WHEN A LOUD AND TERRIBLE VOICE FROM THE LAND CALLED THAMOUS THE PILOT AND HE HAVING RESPONDED AT THE THIRD APPEAL
IS HENPECKED AND SUPERSTITIOUS
YET THE ORTHODOX SHUDDER AND MOAN OUTRAGED IN THEIR PIOUS SENSIBILITIES WHEN ONE DARES TO SPEAK WITH MANLY PLAINNESS OF THEIR DOCTRINES WHICH COMMENCE BY POLLUTING OUR COMMON NATURE
TO WHOM NOTHING WAS MORE NATURAL THAN THE UNNATURAL INCLUDING THE SUPERNATURAL AND THE INFRANATURAL AN APOLOGIST OF OUR DAYS WHO MUST AFFIRM THE ONE RESURRECTION SEEING THAT HIS WHOLE RELIGION IS BASED UPON IT
HAS ITS ANTAGONIST PROVERB EACH BEING TRUE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT OR IN CERTAIN RELATIONS COULD WE CONCEIVE AN ABSTRACT INTELLECT WE MIGHT CONCEIVE IT DWELLING CONTINUALLY
AND AS THESE THREE MEN COULD NOT HAVE DONE WHAT THEY DID IN FURTHERANCE OF THE GLORIOUS WORK WITHOUT A WELL KNOWN INSPIRATION A FOURTH MEMORIAL THE GRANDEST OF ALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ERECTED TO THE DEVIL
IS HIM IN HIM OF HIM BY HIM HE IS THE GOOD PAN THE GREAT SHEPHERD AT WHOSE DEATH WERE MOANINGS SIGHS TREPIDATIONS
HAVE EVEN HAD THE HEART TO DEGRADE THIS FIRST PREACHER OF THE MOUNTAIN THE PUREST HERO OF LIBERTY FOR UNABLE TO DENY THAT HE WAS EARTH'S GREATEST MAN THEY HAVE MADE OF HIM HEAVEN'S SMALLEST GOD
IF JESUS HAD ASCENDED AND CONTINUED TO ASCEND WITH THE SPEED OF LIGHT HE MIGHT BE ASCENDING NOW
FOR THERE ARE LARGE GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS OF INCOMPARABLY GREATER IMPORTANCE WHICH IT LEAVES OUT ALTOGETHER IT IS AS IF A CASE RULED BY BROAD PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY WERE TO BE DECIDED ON THE NARROWEST TECHNICAL GROUNDS
WE CAN CONCEIVE AND SYMPATHISE WITH THIS SIMPLE FAITH BUT IT IS HARD TO CONCEIVE AND SYMPATHISE WITH THE BLIND FAITH WHICH SEEMS WILFULLY BLIND
HE PREACHED THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IF GOD WHY DID HE NOT BRING THE KINGDOM WITH HIM AND MAKE ALL MANKIND FIT FOR IT HE LOVED THE POOR HE TAUGHT THE IGNORANT IF GOD
HOW CAN OUR HUMANITY IMITATE DEITY AND FINALLY A QUESTION TRAMPLING DOWN EVERY ASSERTION IN HIS FAVOR
JESUS AS GOD
CONTESTS NOT THE JUSTICE OF THEIR DOOM WHILE IN THE FINAL CHORUS HE PREDICTS THE SAME DOOM FOR THEIR CONQUEROR IN HIS TURN IN OUR OWN DAY
AND LAMENTATIONS IN ALL THE MACHINE OF THE UNIVERSE HEAVENS EARTH SEA HELLS WITH THIS MY INTERPRETATION THE TIME AGREES FOR THAT MOST GOOD
WHY DID HE LET ANY REMAIN POOR AND IGNORANT HE REBUKED THE PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES IT GOD WHY DID HE NOT WHOLLY PURIFY THEM FROM FORMALISM HYPOCRISY AND UNBELIEF
CONFIDENT THAT TO NOT ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS COULD THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST GIVE A STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SATISFACTORY ANSWER AS THE SCHEME OF THE ATONEMENT IS PRESENTED TO US GOD SACRIFICED HIS ONLY SON
WHY DID THEIR RISEN LORD ONLY SLINK ABOUT AMONG HIS OWN DISCIPLES APPEARING TO THESE BUT AT FLYING INSTANTS WHY DID HE NOT WITH HIS WELL KNOWN FEATURES AND WITH THE WOUNDS OF THE NAILS AND THE SPEAR IN HIS BODY
JESUS ON HIS CROSS MUST DWINDLE TO A POINT EVEN IN THE REALMS OF LEGEND UNDER PROMETHEUS ON CAUCASUS FOR AGES ALREADY THE FATHER HAS BEEN AS SPECTRAL AS JUPITER
SECURING MULTITUDINOUS AND PERMANENTLY RECORDED EVIDENCE SUCH AS NONE OF US COULD DOUBT WE MIGHT GO ON ASKING WHY AND WHY AND WHY IN THIS FASHION ON A HUNDRED POINTS
THIS PRODIGAL MULTIPLICITY AND SUPERFLUITY OF RESURRECTIONS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN NOT A LITTLE EMBARRASSING TO MODERN CHRISTIAN CHAMPIONS THOUGH DOUBTLESS IT DID NOT IN THE LEAST TROUBLE THE PRIMITIVE NON SCIENTIFIC BELIEVERS
THEREFORE WHILE CONFIDENT THAT EVEN ON THESE GROUNDS THE CASE MUST GO AGAINST THE CHRISTIAN BELIEVER I WISH TO ADD A FEW WORDS ON ITS WIDER RELATIONS IN ORDER THAT THE DECISION MAY BE ESTABLISHED
HE ACCEPTS THE JEWISH MIRACLES SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE COME DOWN TO HIM THROUGH MANY GENERATIONS OF HIS FOREFATHERS INVESTED WITH A GLAMOR OF SANCTITY AND HE REGARDS THEM WITH THE EYE OF FAITH WHICH SEES AND SEES NOT
RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION OF JESUS EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX IN REVIEWING MISTER R H HUTTON'S ESSAY ON CHRISTIAN EVIDENCES POPULAR AND CRITICAL
THE PEOPLE WHO PROFESS BELIEF IN THIS ARE SHOCKED AT THE OUTRAGE OFFERED TO OUR HUMANITY BY THE DEVELOPMENT THEORY WHILE THEY THEMSELVES COMMIT THIS OUTRAGE MORE FLAGITIOUS LITTLE MATTERS WHENCE WE SPRANG
LORD FALKLAND HAD ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY A MAN WHO ADORNED THE PUREST VIRTUE WITH THE RICHEST GIFTS OF NATURE AND THE MOST VALUABLE ACQUISITIONS OF LEARNING BY HIM ASSISTED BY THE KING HIMSELF
TOGETHER WITH SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ARE MORE SENSIBLE OF THE DANGER MUST JOIN TOGETHER AND REPRESENT THE MATTER TO HIS MAJESTY SO VIOLENT WAS THE DEMOCRATICAL ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT THE NATION
AND HE NEVER APPEARED GREATER THAN WHEN PLUNGED INTO THE DEEPEST PERILS AND DISTRESSES FROM THE MIXED CHARACTER INDEED OF CHARLES AROSE IN PART THE MISFORTUNES IN WHICH ENGLAND WAS AT THIS TIME INVOLVED
WITH THE TERRORS OF INVASION WITH THE DREAD OF ENGLISH AND IRISH PAPISTS AND THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE PANICS WERE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE NATION LORD DIGBY HAVING ENTERED KINGSTON IN A COACH AND SIX
THAT NONE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY SHOULD MARRY WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT OR COUNCIL
FOR THIS REASON THEY PROTESTED AGAINST ALL LAWS VOTES AND RESOLUTIONS AS NULL AND INVALID WHICH SHOULD PASS DURING THE TIME OF THEIR CONSTRAINED ABSENCE THIS PROTESTATION WHICH
AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE MOST VIRULENT POISON TO DETERMINE HIS CHOICE IN THE APPROACHING CONTESTS EVERY MAN HEARKENED WITH AVIDITY TO THE REASONS PROPOSED ON BOTH SIDES THE WAR OF THE PEN PRECEDED THAT OF THE SWORD
AMIDST THE GREATEST SECURITY THEY AFFECTED CONTINUAL FEARS OF DESTRUCTION TO THEMSELVES AND THE NATION AND SEEMED TO QUAKE AT EVERY BREATH OR RUMOR OF DANGER
THAN SO FAR AS THEY CONCURRED WITH THE MAJORITY IN THEIR VOTES AND SPEECHES THOUGH PROOFS MIGHT PERHAPS BE PRODUCED OF THEIR PRIVATELY INVITING THE SCOTS TO INVADE ENGLAND
DURING THIS TIME OF DISORDER AND DANGER OFFERED THEIR SERVICE TO THE KING BETWEEN THEM AND THE POPULACE THERE PASSED FREQUENT SKIRMISHES WHICH ENDED NOT WITHOUT BLOODSHED BY WAY OF REPROACH
HE WAS APT TO ASCRIBE THEM IN A GREAT MEASURE TO HIS OWN INDOLENCE AND FACILITY THE QUEEN AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FURTHER STIMULATED HIS PASSION AND REPRESENTED THAT
WOULD ADMIT HIM WITH HIS RETINUE AFTER WHICH HE MIGHT EASILY RENDER HIMSELF MASTER OF THE PLACE BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS ON HIS GUARD HE SHUT THE GATES AND REFUSED TO RECEIVE THE KING
NEXT MORNING CHARLES SENT TO THE MAYOR AND ORDERED HIM TO CALL A COMMON COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK HE HIMSELF ATTENDED ONLY BY THREE OR FOUR LORDS WENT TO GUILDHALL
THOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY LEVIED A GUARD FOR THEMSELVES HAD ATTEMPTED TO SEIZE ALL THE MILITARY POWER ALL THE NAVY AND ALL THE FORTS OF THE KINGDOM AND HAD OPENLY EMPLOYED THEIR AUTHORITY IN EVERY KIND OF WARLIKE PREPARATIONS YET IMMEDIATELY VOTED
MOBBISH COMBATS AND SKIRMISHES ENSUED THE PARLIAMENT ON THIS OCCASION WENT SO FAR AS TO VOTE THAT WHEN THE LORDS AND COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT WHICH IS THE SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE
AND THE HEARTS OF HIS LOYAL SUBJECTS WHICH WITH GOD'S BLESSING HE DOUBTED NOT WOULD RECOVER ALL THE REST COLLECTING THEREFORE SOME FORCES HE ADVANCED SOUTHWARDS
WERE AGAIN ROUSED TO SEDITION AND TUMULTS THAT THE BLACKEST CALUMNIES WERE PROPAGATED AGAINST HIM AND EVEN THE IRISH MASSACRE ASCRIBED TO HIS COUNSELS AND MACHINATIONS
AND THAT THE PEERS WERE NOTHING BUT INDIVIDUALS WHO HELD THEIR SEATS IN A PARTICULAR CAPACITY AND THEREFORE IF THEIR LORDSHIPS WILL NOT CONSENT TO THE PASSING OF ACTS NECESSARY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE PEOPLE THE COMMONS
FORTY SHILLINGS FOR EACH COMMONER UPON THIS NOTABLE INTELLIGENCE ORDERS WERE ISSUED FOR SEIZING PRIESTS AND JESUITS A CONFERENCE WAS DESIRED WITH THE LORDS
BUT THE TIDE OF POPULARITY SEIZED MANY AND CARRIED THEM WIDE OF THE MOST ESTABLISHED MAXIMS OF CIVIL POLICY AMONG THE OPPONENTS OF THE KING ARE RANKED THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND LORD ADMIRAL A MAN OF THE FIRST FAMILY AND FORTUNE
WHILE THE HOUSE OF PEERS ARE SCARCELY ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCY OR TO REJECT THE BILLS SENT THEM BY THE COMMONS WILL THEY EVER BE PERMITTED BY THE POPULACE SUPPOSING THEM INCLINED
WHILE THEY CLOTHED THEIR PERSONAL FEARS OR AMBITION UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF NATIONAL AND IMMINENT DANGER MADE UNKNOWINGLY AN APOLOGY FOR THE MOST EXCEPTIONABLE PART OF THE KING'S CONDUCT
THAT THE EMPLOYING OF SUCH ODIOUS MEANS FOR SO INVIDIOUS AN END WOULD AT LONG RUN LOSE THEM ALL THEIR POPULARITY AND TURN THE TIDE OF FAVOR TO THE CONTRARY PARTY AND THAT IF THE KING ONLY REMAINED IN TRANQUILLITY
THE PEERS VOTED A DECLARATION AGAINST THOSE TUMULTS AND SENT IT TO THE LOWER HOUSE BUT THESE REFUSED THEIR CONCURRENCE SOME SEDITIOUS APPRENTICES BEING SEIZED AND COMMITTED TO PRISON IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED THEIR LIBERTY
HE TOLD THE COMMON COUNCIL THAT HE WAS SORRY TO HEAR OF THE APPREHENSIONS ENTERTAINED OF HIM THAT HE WAS COME TO THEM WITHOUT ANY GUARD IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW MUCH HE RELIED ON THEIR AFFECTIONS
THAT HE EXPECTED FROM THEM NO OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMANDS WHICH WERE NOT WARRANTED BY THE LAWS OF THE LAND THE PEERS ANSWERED THIS DECLARATION BY A PROTEST
THE LESS WOULD THEY BE INCLINED TO SECOND THAT RASH AND DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE THAT THE PEERS WOULD CERTAINLY REFUSE THEIR CONCURRENCE NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES OF PREVAILING ON THEM BUT BY INSTIGATING THE POPULACE TO TUMULT AND DISORDER
YESTERDAY I SENT A SERJEANT AT ARMS TO DEMAND SOME WHO BY MY ORDER WERE ACCUSED OF HIGH TREASON INSTEAD OF OBEDIENCE I RECEIVED A MESSAGE I MUST HERE DECLARE TO YOU
AND THE DEPUTY LIEUTENANTS OF SOME SUSPECTED COUNTIES WERE ORDERED TO PUT THE PEOPLE IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE THE PULPITS LIKEWISE WERE CALLED IN AID
HAVING PASSED AN ORDER FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAWS WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC WORSHIP THE COMMONS ASSUMED SUCH AUTHORITY THAT BY A VOTE ALONE OF THEIR HOUSE THEY SUSPENDED THOSE LAWS THOUGH ENACTED BY THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE
THAT THOUGH THEY HAD AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO SIT AND VOTE IN PARLIAMENT YET IN COMING THITHER THEY HAD BEEN MENACED ASSAULTED AFFRONTED BY THE UNRULY MULTITUDE AND COULD NO LONGER WITH SAFETY ATTEND THEIR DUTY IN THE HOUSE
WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOT OF A CIVIL BUT OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE THE DISTEMPERED IMAGINATIONS OF MEN WERE AGITATED WITH A CONTINUAL DREAD OF POPERY WITH A HORROR AGAINST PRELACY WITH AN ANTIPATHY TO CEREMONIES AND THE LITURGY
AND THAT THE HOUSE OF PEERS WOULD HAVE NO PART IN THE HONOR NAY THEY WENT SO FAR AS OPENLY TO TELL THE LORDS THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF THE WHOLE KINGDOM
AND THEY HAD TIME TO WITHDRAW A MOMENT BEFORE THE KING ENTERED HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ORDINARY RETINUE TO THE NUMBER OF ABOVE TWO HUNDRED ARMED AS USUAL SOME WITH HALBERTS
THAT HOUSE DESIRED A CONFERENCE WITH THE COMMONS WHOM THEY INFORMED OF THIS UNEXPECTED PROTESTATION THE OPPORTUNITY WAS SEIZED WITH JOY AND TRIUMPH
UNITED TO A MIDDLING CAPACITY THAT RIGID INFLEXIBILITY OF HONOR WHICH FORMS THE PROPER ORNAMENT OF A NOBLEMAN AND A SOLDIER LORD KIMBOLTON SOON AFTER EARL OF MANCHESTER A PERSON DISTINGUISHED BY HUMANITY GENEROSITY
YOU SPEAK OF JEALOUSIES AND FEARS LAY YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEARTS AND ASK YOURSELVES WHETHER I MAY NOT LIKEWISE BE DISTURBED WITH FEARS AND JEALOUSIES AND IF SO I ASSURE YOU THAT THIS MESSAGE HAS NOTHING LESSENED THEM
THAT A TOTAL CONFUSION OF ALL RANK AND ORDER WAS JUSTLY TO BE APPREHENDED AND THE WONDER WAS NOT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE NOBLES SHOULD SEEK SHELTER UNDER THE THRONE
THEIR OWN MEMBERS ALSO WHO SHOULD RETURN TO THEM THEY VOTED NOT TO ADMIT TILL SATISFIED CONCERNING THE REASON OF THEIR ABSENCE CHARLES MADE A DECLARATION TO THE PEERS WHO ATTENDED HIM
UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THEY PRETENDED BY A VERBAL CRITICISM ON THE TENSE OF A LATIN VERB TO RAVISH FROM THE KING HIS NEGATIVE VOICE IN THE LEGISLATURE
AND TO SIDE WITH THEM IN THEIR TRAITOROUS DESIGNS
THOSE VERY FORCES WHICH THEY EMPLOYED AGAINST HIM THEY LEVIED IN HIS NAME AND BY HIS AUTHORITY IT IS REMARKABLE HOW MUCH THE TOPICS OF ARGUMENT WERE NOW REVERSED BETWEEN THE PARTIES THE KING
THEY COMPLAINED OF THE KING'S FILLING FIVE VACANT SEES AND CONSIDERED IT AS AN INSULT UPON THEM
HOWEVER RIDICULOUS WERE WILLINGLY ATTENDED TO AND WERE DISPERSED AMONG THE MULTITUDE TO WHOSE CAPACITY THEY WERE WELL ADAPTED BEALE A TAILOR INFORMED THE COMMONS THAT WALKING IN THE FIELDS
THAT THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE WERE NO LONGER EXPOSED TO ANY PERIL FROM ROYAL AUTHORITY SO NARROWLY CIRCUMSCRIBED SO EXACTLY DEFINED
ALL THIS CONSIDERED THERE IS A JUDGMENT OF HEAVEN UPON THIS NATION IF THESE DISTRACTIONS CONTINUE GOD SO DEAL WITH ME AND MINE AS ALL MY THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS ARE UPRIGHT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE TRUE PROTESTANT PROFESSION
AND SO FAMILIAR IN ALL ACTS OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS AFRAID HAD THEY TOTALLY OMITTED IT THAT THE INNOVATION WOULD BE TOO SENSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE IN ALL COMMANDS THEREFORE WHICH THEY CONFERRED
THE KING WAS BETRAYED INTO ANOTHER INDISCRETION MUCH MORE FATAL AN INDISCRETION TO WHICH ALL THE ENSUING DISORDERS AND CIVIL WARS OUGHT IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY TO BE ASCRIBED
HAD ALREADY RISEN TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND GAVE SUFFICIENT WARNING OF THEIR FUTURE ATTEMPTS UPON THAT ORDER THEY MUTTERED SOMEWHAT OF THEIR REGRET THAT THEY SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO SAVE THE KINGDOM ALONE
WHO WERE APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE OR PERHAPS ACTUATED BY THEIR OWN TERRORS RAN FROM GATE TO GATE CRYING OUT THAT THE CAVALIERS WERE COMING TO BURN THE CITY AND THAT THE KING HIMSELF WAS AT THEIR HEAD
THAT THE KING MIGHT DESPAIR OF ALL COMPOSITION
AND THAT NO PEER BE MADE BUT WITH CONSENT OF BOTH HOUSES SHOULD I GRANT THESE DEMANDS SAID THE KING IN REPLY I MAY BE WAITED ON BAREHEADED I MAY HAVE MY HAND KISSED
WHO DESIRED LEAVE TO ENTER WITH TWENTY PERSONS ONLY CHARLES IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TRAITOR
THE PERSONS WHOM HE HAD ACCUSED THIS RESOLUTION WAS DISCOVERED TO THE COUNTESS OF CARLISLE SISTER TO NORTHUMBERLAND A LADY OF SPIRIT WIT AND INTRIGUE SHE PRIVATELY SENT INTELLIGENCE TO THE FIVE MEMBERS
IN THEIR ATTACK ON THE HIERARCHY THEY STILL MORE OPENLY PASSED ALL BOUNDS OF MODERATION AS SUPPOSING NO DOUBT
NEAR THE MOIETY TOO OF THE LOWER HOUSE ABSENTED THEMSELVES FROM COUNSELS WHICH THEY DEEMED SO FULL OF DANGER THE COMMONS SENT UP AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST NINE PEERS FOR DESERTING THEIR DUTY IN PARLIAMENT
THEY MADE A DEMAND THE MOST ABSURD IN THE WORLD THAT THE BISHOPS BEING ALL OF THEM PARTIES SHOULD BE REFUSED A VOTE WITH REGARD TO THAT QUESTION AFTER THE RESOLUTION WAS ONCE FORMED BY THE COMMONS
HE NOW PREPARED HIMSELF FOR DEFENCE WITH A SPIRIT ACTIVITY AND ADDRESS
HE ASKED THE SPEAKER WHO STOOD BELOW WHETHER ANY OF THESE PERSONS WERE IN THE HOUSE THE SPEAKER FALLING ON HIS KNEE PRUDENTLY REPLIED I HAVE SIR
BUT THE PICTURE BUT THE SIGN OF A KING WAR ON ANY TERMS WAS ESTEEMED BY THE KING AND ALL THE COUNSELLORS PREFERABLE TO SO IGNOMINIOUS A PEACE
AND THAT HE HAD ACCUSED CERTAIN MEN OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST WHOM HE WOULD PROCEED IN A LEGAL WAY AND THEREFORE PRESUMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT MEET WITH PROTECTION IN THE CITY AFTER MANY OTHER GRACIOUS EXPRESSIONS
AND RESOUNDED WITH THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED RELIGION FROM THE DESPERATE ATTEMPTS OF PAPISTS AND MALIGNANTS MULTITUDES FLOCKED TOWARDS WESTMINSTER AND INSULTED THE PRELATES AND SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ADHERED TO THE CROWN
AND FOR THE OBSERVANCE AND PRESERVATION OF THE LAWS AND I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS AND ASSIST THOSE LAWS FOR MY PRESERVATION NO SOONER DID THE COMMONS DESPAIR OF OBTAINING THE KING'S CONSENT TO THEIR BILL THAN THEY INSTANTLY VOTED
THEY ISSUED ORDERS FOR BRINGING IN LOANS OF MONEY AND PLATE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN FORCES WHICH SHOULD DEFEND THE KING AND BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT FOR THIS STYLE THEY STILL PRESERVED WITHIN TEN DAYS
THEIR DEMANDS CONTAINED IN NINETEEN PROPOSITIONS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY THEY REQUIRED THAT NO MAN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COUNCIL WHO WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO PARLIAMENT
MESSENGERS WERE EMPLOYED TO SEARCH FOR THEM AND ARREST THEM THEIR TRUNKS CHAMBERS AND STUDIES WERE SEALED AND LOCKED THE HOUSE VOTED ALL THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO BE BREACHES OF PRIVILEGE
THIS WAS THE IMPEACHMENT OF LORD KIMBOLTON AND THE FIVE MEMBERS WHEN THE COMMONS EMPLOYED IN THEIR REMONSTRANCE LANGUAGE SO SEVERE AND INDECENT THEY HAD NOT BEEN ACTUATED ENTIRELY BY INSOLENCE AND PASSION
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY SUCCEEDED BEYOND THEIR FONDEST WISHES CHARLES WAS ENRAGED TO FIND THAT ALL HIS CONCESSIONS BUT INCREASED THEIR DEMANDS
NEVER WERE THERE INDIVIDUALS WHO POSSESSED MORE CAPACITY MORE COURAGE MORE PUBLIC SPIRIT MORE DISINTERESTED ZEAL THE INFUSION OF ONE INGREDIENT IN TOO LARGE A PROPORTION HAD CORRUPTED ALL THESE NOBLE PRINCIPLES
AS HE PROFESSED A RESOLUTION STRICTLY TO OBSERVE THE LAW HIMSELF SO WAS HE DETERMINED HE SAID TO OBLIGE EVERY OTHER PERSON TO PAY IT A LIKE OBEDIENCE THE NAME OF THE KING WAS SO ESSENTIAL TO ALL LAWS
THAT THOUGH NO KING THAT EVER WAS IN ENGLAND COULD BE MORE CAREFUL OF YOUR PRIVILEGES THAN I SHALL BE YET IN CASES OF TREASON NO PERSON HAS PRIVILEGE
WERE TRAITORS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE KINGDOM THE ARMIES WHICH HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE RAISED ON PRETENCE OF THE SERVICE IN IRELAND WERE HENCEFORTH MORE OPENLY ENLISTED BY THE PARLIAMENT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES
THAT THEY HAD TRAITOROUSLY ENDEAVORED TO SUBVERT THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS AND GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM TO DEPRIVE THE KING OF HIS REGAL POWER AND TO IMPOSE ON HIS SUBJECTS AN ARBITRARY AND TYRANNICAL AUTHORITY THAT THEY HAD ENDEAVORED
THAT THE VOTES OF POPISH LORDS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED THAT THE REFORMATION OF THE LITURGY AND CHURCH GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE PLACE ACCORDING TO ADVICE OF PARLIAMENT THAT THE ORDINANCE WITH REGARD TO THE MILITIA BE SUBMITTED TO
WHILE HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERROR OF EMPLOYING A PLEA OF NECESSITY IN ORDER TO INFRINGE THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION WARNED THE PARLIAMENT NOT TO IMITATE AN EXAMPLE ON WHICH THEY THREW SUCH VIOLENT BLAME AND THE PARLIAMENT
IT WILL HAZARD THE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY OF ALL HIS KINGDOMS UNLESS SOME SPEEDY REMEDY BE APPLIED BY THE WISDOM AND AUTHORITY OF BOTH HOUSES AND THAT SUCH OF THE SUBJECTS AS HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE AGAINST THE COMMON DANGER
EVERY MEASURE PURSUED BY THE COMMONS
BY MANY FOUL ASPERSIONS ON HIS MAJESTY AND HIS GOVERNMENT TO ALIENATE THE AFFECTIONS OF HIS PEOPLE AND MAKE HIM ODIOUS TO THEM THAT THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO DRAW HIS LATE ARMY TO DISOBEDIENCE OF HIS ROYAL COMMANDS
AND COMMANDED EVERY ONE TO DEFEND THE LIBERTY OF THE MEMBERS THE KING IRRITATED BY ALL THIS OPPOSITION RESOLVED NEXT DAY TO COME IN PERSON TO THE HOUSE WITH AN INTENTION TO DEMAND PERHAPS SEIZE IN THEIR PRESENCE
AND WAIT TILL THE TREASURERS COULD FIND LEISURE TO RECEIVE THEM SUCH ZEAL ANIMATED THE PIOUS PARTISANS OF THE PARLIAMENT
AND THEY PROCEEDED TO FRAME AN ORDINANCE IN WHICH BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT THEY NAMED LIEUTENANTS FOR ALL THE COUNTIES AND CONFERRED ON THEM THE COMMAND OF THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE OF ALL THE GUARDS
THAT THOSE WHO ADVISED HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER WERE ENEMIES TO THE STATE AND MISCHIEVOUS PROJECTORS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF THE NATION THAT THIS DENIAL IS OF SUCH DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE THAT IF HIS MAJESTY PERSIST IN IT
BEING DISTINGUISHABLE BY THEIR HABIT AND BEING THE OBJECT OF VIOLENT HATRED TO ALL THE SECTARIES WERE EXPOSED TO THE MOST DANGEROUS INSULTS WILLIAMS NOW CREATED ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
GARRISONS AND FORTS OF THE KINGDOM HE ISSUED PROCLAMATIONS AGAINST THIS MANIFEST USURPATION
WHICH WAS BEFORE SUFFICIENTLY PROVIDED WITH RELIGIOUS AS WELL AS CIVIL CAUSES OF QUARREL WAS ALSO SUPPLIED WITH PARTY NAMES UNDER WHICH THE FACTIONS MIGHT RENDEZVOUS AND SIGNALIZE THEIR MUTUAL HATRED
OF INVADING THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF CHURCH AND STATE IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT THEIR PROCEEDINGS IN SUCH A VIOLENT ATTEMPT WOULD THENCEFORTH BE ALTOGETHER REGULAR AND EQUITABLE BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT
THEIR VIEWS WERE MORE SOLID AND PROFOUND THEY CONSIDERED THAT IN A VIOLENT ATTEMPT SUCH AS AN INVASION OF THE ANCIENT CONSTITUTION THE MORE LEISURE WAS AFFORDED THE PEOPLE TO REFLECT
HOW COULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE CONSIDERED AS TREASON AFTER THE ACT OF OBLIVION WHICH HAD PASSED AND AFTER THAT BOTH HOUSES WITH THE KING'S CONCURRENCE HAD VOTED THAT NATION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THEIR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE
TO THE ORDINANCE OF THE PARLIAMENT CONCERNING THE MILITIA THE KING OPPOSED HIS COMMISSIONS OF ARRAY THE COUNTIES OBEYED THE ONE OR THE OTHER ACCORDING AS THEY STOOD AFFECTED AND IN MANY COUNTIES WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE DIVIDED
BUT SURELY WAS NEVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED IN OPPOSITION TO A FACTION DURING THE FULL TIDE OF ITS POWER AND SUCCESS BUT MEN HAD NOT LEISURE TO WONDER AT THE INDISCRETION OF THIS MEASURE
WERE THE MEMORIALS OF THE ROYAL PARTY CHIEFLY COMPOSED SO SENSIBLE WAS CHARLES OF HIS SUPERIORITY IN THIS PARTICULAR THAT HE TOOK CARE TO DISPERSE EVERY WHERE THE PAPERS OF THE PARLIAMENT TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN
ATTENDED BY A FEW LIVERY SERVANTS THE INTELLIGENCE WAS CONVEYED TO LONDON AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY VOTED THAT HE HAD APPEARED IN A HOSTILE MANNER TO THE TERROR AND AFFRIGHT OF HIS MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS
MIGHT BE MAINTAINED UPON VERY PLAUSIBLE TOPICS BUT THAT THE DANGER ALLOWING IT TO HAVE ANY EXISTENCE WAS NOT OF THAT KIND GREAT URGENT INEVITABLE WHICH DISSOLVES ALL LAW AND LEVELS ALL LIMITATIONS
HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF MANY AND TO RECOVER THEM FROM THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH AT FIRST THEY HAD BEEN SEIZED
HE EMPLOYED ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH REMAINED TO HIM AND ROUSED UP HIS ADHERENTS TO ARMS THE RESOURCES OF THIS PRINCE'S GENIUS INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
BESIDES NUMBERLESS VEXATIONS AND PERSECUTIONS WHICH THE CLERGY UNDERWENT FROM THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE LOWER HOUSE THE PEERS WHILE THE KING WAS IN SCOTLAND
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HAVE I VIOLATED YOUR LAWS HAVE I DENIED TO PASS ANY BILL FOR THE EASE AND SECURITY OF MY SUBJECTS I DO NOT ASK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME
NEITHER EYES TO SEE NOR TONGUE TO SPEAK IN THIS PLACE BUT AS THE HOUSE IS PLEASED TO DIRECT ME WHOSE SERVANT I AM AND I HUMBLY ASK PARDON
THEY POSSESSED AUTHORITY SUFFICIENT TO REGULATE AND CONTROL IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A MAJORITY IN THE UPPER HOUSE THE COMMONS HAD RECOURSE TO THE POPULACE WHO ON OTHER OCCASIONS HAD DONE THEM SUCH IMPORTANT SERVICE
THEY WERE THEREFORE RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO EXCITE HIM TO SOME VIOLENT PASSION
IN ORDER TO REMOVE ALL JEALOUSY HE HAD RESOLVED THAT THEIR USURPATIONS AND ILLEGAL PRETENSIONS SHOULD BE APPARENT TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND THOUGHT THAT TO RECOVER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS A POINT MUCH MORE MATERIAL TO HIS INTEREST
HE HEARD THE CRY PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT RESOUNDING FROM ALL QUARTERS
THAT THE KING SEDUCED BY WICKED COUNSEL INTENDED TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HIS PARLIAMENT WHO IN ALL THEIR CONSULTATIONS AND ACTIONS HAD PROPOSED NO OTHER END BUT THE CARE OF HIS KINGDOMS
BY COMPARISON TO FORM A JUDGMENT BETWEEN THEM THE PARLIAMENT WHILE THEY DISTRIBUTED COPIES OF THEIR OWN WERE ANXIOUS TO SUPPRESS ALL THE KING'S COMPOSITIONS
THAN THE COLLECTING OF ANY MAGAZINES STORES OR ARMIES WHICH MIGHT BREED APPREHENSIONS OF VIOLENT OR ILLEGAL COUNSELS BUT THE URGENT NECESSITY OF HIS SITUATION NO LONGER ADMITTED OF DELAY
THESE GENTLEMEN GAVE THE RABBLE THE APPELLATION OF ROUNDHEADS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SHORT CROPPED HAIR WHICH THEY WORE THESE CALLED THE OTHERS CAVALIERS AND THUS THE NATION
I NEVER DID INTEND ANY FORCE BUT SHALL PROCEED AGAINST THEM IN A FAIR AND LEGAL WAY FOR I NEVER MEANT ANY OTHER AND NOW SINCE I SEE I CANNOT DO WHAT I CAME FOR
AND ENDOWED WITH THAT DIGNIFIED PRIDE WHICH SO WELL BECAME HIS RANK AND STATION THE EARL OF ESSEX WHO INHERITED ALL HIS FATHER'S POPULARITY AND HAVING FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH SOUGHT RENOWN IN ARMS
THEY BOUND THE PERSONS TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND INVENTING A DISTINCTION HITHERTO UNHEARD OF BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND THE PERSON OF THE KING
AND WERE PROMISED REWARDS FOR THESE ASSASSINATIONS
AFFABILITY AND EVERY AMIABLE VIRTUE THESE MEN FINDING THAT THEIR CREDIT RAN HIGH WITH THE NATION VENTURED TO ENCOURAGE THOSE POPULAR DISORDERS WHICH THEY VAINLY IMAGINED
IF HE EXERTED THE VIGOR AND DISPLAYED THE MAJESTY OF A MONARCH THE DARING USURPATIONS OF HIS SUBJECTS WOULD SHRINK BEFORE HIM LORD DIGBY A MAN OF FINE PARTS BUT FULL OF LEVITY AND HURRIED ON BY PRECIPITATE PASSIONS
AND THE COMMAND OF THEM WAS GIVEN TO THE EARL OF ESSEX IN LONDON NO LESS THAN FOUR THOUSAND MEN ENLISTED IN ONE DAY AND THE PARLIAMENT VOTED A DECLARATION WHICH THEY REQUIRED EVERY MEMBER TO SUBSCRIBE
AND MORE ACTUATED BY PRINCIPLE
SEEM TO BE COMMON BETWEEN THE IMPEACHED MEMBERS AND THE PARLIAMENT
THE TITLE OF MAJESTY MAY BE CONTINUED TO ME AND THE KING'S AUTHORITY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES MAY STILL BE THE STYLE OF YOUR COMMANDS I MAY HAVE SWORDS AND MACES CARRIED BEFORE ME
HE HAD HEARKENED TO THE DISCOURSE OF CERTAIN PERSONS UNKNOWN TO HIM AND HAD HEARD THEM TALK OF A MOST DANGEROUS CONSPIRACY A HUNDRED AND EIGHT RUFFIANS AS HE LEARNED HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO MURDER A HUNDRED AND EIGHT LORDS AND COMMONERS
THAT THE JUSTICE OF PARLIAMENT PASS UPON ALL DELINQUENTS THAT A GENERAL PARDON BE GRANTED WITH SUCH EXCEPTIONS AS SHOULD BE ADVISED BY PARLIAMENT THAT THE FORTS AND CASTLES BE DISPOSED OF BY CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
AND WHEN I SAW BY HER CLEARING BROW AND PEACEFUL LOOK THAT I HAD FULLY PERSUADED HER OF THIS I LET HER SPEAK WHAT WORDS SHE WOULD AND TELL AS SHE WAS ABLE
SMILED AS SHE MET HIS EYE WITH THAT CURIOUS SLOW DIPPING OF HER DIMPLES WHICH HAD MORE THAN ONCE CONFOUNDED THE CORONER AND RENDERED HER AT ONCE THE ADMIRATION AND ABHORRENCE OF THE CROWD
THE TIDE WAS UP AND OVER SWEPT EVERYTHING FOR AN INSTANT
HE SOON RECOGNISED THAT HIS OWN JUDGMENT WAS NOT AT FAULT AND THAT NOTWITHSTANDING OUTWARD APPEARANCES AND THE LANGUID INTEREST SHOWN IN THE NOW LAGGING PROCEEDINGS
WAS ALMOST APPALLING IN ITS INTENSITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISTER SUTHERLAND'S NEAR PRESENCE THE FEELING WOULD HAVE RISEN TO OUTBREAK AND MANY VOICES WERE HELD IN SUBJECTION BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THIS VENERATED MAN'S LAST LOOK
SHE ENJOINED ME NOT TO ENLIGHTEN HIM NOW IF BY ANY SACRIFICE ON MY PART I COULD RIGHTFULLY AVOID IT THAT SHE WAS HAPPY IN HAVING ME HEAR THE TRUTH BEFORE SHE DIED THAT THE JOY WHICH THIS GAVE HER WAS SO GREAT
THAT UNKNOWN TO ME UNKNOWN TO ANYONE LIVING BUT HERSELF UNKNOWN TO THAT GOOD MAN FROM WHOM IT CAN NO LONGER BE KEPT HIDDEN AGATHA WEBB WAS MY MOTHER
HE WITHSTOOD THE CLAMOUR AND BEGAN SPEAKING AGAIN BEFORE THE CORONER HAD BEEN ABLE TO FULLY RESTORE QUIET I KNOW SAID HE
GIVE THEN I WANT HUNDREDS THOUSANDS NOW NOW TO SAVE MYSELF DISGRACE SHAME PRISON AWAIT ME IF I DON'T HAVE THEM GIVE GIVE AND MY HAND WENT OUT TOWARD IT NOT TOWARD HER
WITH A FELL AND STEADY PURPOSE HE FOUND HIS RIGHT HAND STEALING TOWARD THE LEFT IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION SHE EXPECTED BETTER TO YIELD THAN FALL HEADLONG INTO THE PIT ONE WORD OF HERS WOULD OPEN
LAY IN THE GENEROSITY OF THIS GREAT HEARTED WOMAN AND IF OUT OF PUSILLANIMITY
OR AT LEAST TO HEAR THE SOUND OF MERRY VOICES AND LAUGHTER IN THE ROOMS ABOVE BUT NO SOUNDS OF ANY SORT AWAITED ME INDEED THE HOUSE SEEMED STRANGELY SILENT FOR ONE SO FULLY LIGHTED AND ASTONISHED AT THIS
AND HAD ALMOST TOUCHED HIS FINGER IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION OF ASSENT WHICH AMABEL AWAITED WITH BREATHLESS EXPECTATION WHEN WAS IT MIRACLE OR ONLY THE SUGGESTION OF HIS BETTER NATURE
AND TOLD HIM OF THE STRANGE AND HEART RENDING ADVENTURE WHICH HAD CHANGED THE WHOLE TENOR OF MY THOUGHTS AND LIFE
I HASTENED AWAY AND TOOK THE SHORTEST PATH HOME HAD I BEEN MORE OF A MAN OR IF MY VISIT TO MISSUS WEBB HAD BEEN ACTUATED BY A MORE COMMUNICABLE MOTIVE I WOULD HAVE GONE AT ONCE TO THE GOOD MAN WHO BELIEVED ME TO BE OF HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
BUT SHE MISTOOK THE ACTION MISTOOK MY PURPOSE AND
NOT EVEN FOR HIS MONEY FOR SHE COULD CONTEMPLATE ITS LOSS BUT FOR HIMSELF WHO HAD SO BOLDLY SHOWN THAT HE WAS STRONGER THAN SHE AND COULD TRIUMPH OVER HER BY THE SHEER FORCE OF HIS MASCULINE DARING
WITH SUCH FEELINGS
HE HAD NOT MEANT TO YIELD BUT NOW THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME NOW THAT HE MUST AT ONCE AND FOREVER CHOOSE BETWEEN A COURSE THAT LED SIMPLY TO PERSONAL UNHAPPINESS AND ONE THAT INVOLVED NOT ONLY HIMSELF
STARTLED THE CROWD AND GAVE SWEETWATER ALREADY SUFFERING UNDER SHOCK AFTER SHOCK OF MINGLED SURPRISE AND WONDER
OR LINEAGE THE WONDER THE INCREDULITY YOU MANIFEST ARE MY BEST EXCUSE FOR MY LONG DELAY IN REVEALING THE SECRET ENTRUSTED TO ME BY THIS DYING WOMAN AN AWED SILENCE GREETED THESE WORDS
LOOKED AWAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
GAVE TO HERSELF THE BLOW WHICH HAS ROBBED US ALL OF A MOST VALUABLE LIFE SHE WAS NOT MURDERED IT WAS A SOLEMN ASSERTION BUT IT FAILED TO CONVINCE THE CROWD BEFORE HIM AS BY ONE IMPULSE MEN AND WOMEN BROKE INTO A TUMULT
AND I IN SCARCELY BETTER CASE FELL ALSO THIS AS GOD LIVES IS THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE WOUND FOUND IN THE BREAST OF THIS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN WOMAN THE FEELING THE PATHOS THE ANGUISH EVEN TO BE FOUND IN HIS TONE MADE THIS STORY
WOULD THUS BE LOST YOU SEE I HAD NOT CALCULATED ON MISS AMABEL PAGE
HE DID NOT LOSE HIS DETERMINED ATTITUDE HE HAD OBSERVED A CHANGE IN AMABEL AND A CHANGE IN AGNES AND IF ONLY TO DISAPPOINT THE VILE TRIUMPH OF THE ONE
AS I DID SO HE GAVE A SIGH BUT DID NOT WAKE
AND QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING A VERY UNSELFISH ACT STILL THIS WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE REASON ENOUGH FOR ME TO INTRUDE UPON HER LATE AT NIGHT WITH A PLEA FOR A LARGE LOAN OF MONEY HAD I NOT BEEN IN A DESPERATE CONDITION OF MIND
BUT VITAL CONSEQUENCE FREDERICK WAS NOT VISIBLE IN THE GREAT HALL BUT THAT HE WAS NEAR AT HAND SOON BECAME EVIDENT FROM THE CHANGE SWEETWATER NOW SAW IN AMABEL
AND GLANCED AT THE GREAT DOOR OF ENTRANCE WITH AN EVIL EXPECTANCY THAT STARTLED EVEN SWEETWATER SO LITTLE HAD HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PASSIONS LABOURING IN THAT VENOMOUS BREAST
WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO RESUME HIS SEAT
WITH A NOBLE AIR FROM WHICH ALL HESITATION HAD VANISHED FREDERICK STARTED TOWARDS THE PLACE INDICATED BUT STOPPED BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN A HALF DOZEN STEPS
NO ONE SO MUCH AS MADE A GESTURE OF DISAPPROVAL THEN MISTER SUTHERLAND STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET CAST ONE LAST LOOK AROUND HIM AND DISAPPEARED THROUGH A DOOR WHICH HAD OPENED LIKE MAGIC BEFORE HIM THEN AND NOT TILL THEN
JAMES ZABEL MUCH LESS THAT IT BORE HIS INITIALS ON THE HANDLE HE PAUSED AND THE AWE OCCASIONED BY THE SCENE HE HAD DESCRIBED WAS SO DEEP AND THE SILENCE SO PROLONGED THAT A SHUDDER PASSED OVER THE WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE
WAS THE FIRM RESPONSE THEN GENTLEMEN CONTINUED FREDERICK STILL WITHOUT LOOKING AT AMABEL WHOSE SMILE HAD ACQUIRED A MOCKERY THAT DREW THE EYES OF THE JURY TOWARD HER MORE THAN ONCE DURING THE FOLLOWING RECITAL
THERE IS NO BLOOD ON YOU SHE MURMURED YOU DID NOT STRIKE THE BLOW
YOU KNOW AND THE PUBLIC GENERALLY NOW KNOW THAT MISSUS WEBB HAS LEFT ME THE GREATER PORTION OF THE MONEY OF WHICH SHE DIED POSSESSED I HAVE NEVER BEFORE ACKNOWLEDGED TO ANYONE NOT EVEN TO THE GOOD MAN WHO AWAITS THIS JURY'S VERDICT
AND TO HIM A FULL ATTENTION WAS BEING GIVEN IN THE HOPE THAT SOME REAL ENLIGHTENMENT WOULD COME AT LAST TO SETTLE THE QUESTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED BY AMABEL'S INCOMPLETE AND UNSATISFACTORY TESTIMONY BUT NO MAN CAN FURNISH WHAT HE DOES NOT POSSESS
I PUSHED THE DOOR AJAR AT MY LEFT AND LOOKED IN AN UNEXPECTED AND PITIFUL SIGHT AWAITED ME
IF YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME IN ONE OF THESE ROOMS I WILL REPEAT MY TALE IN YOUR EARS BUT GO NOW IT IS MY LAST ENTREATY THERE WAS A SILENCE NO ONE VENTURED A DISSENT
BUT IF ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO ME THINKS ME GUILTY OF THE DEATH I WAS SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO HAVE WITNESSED
YOU HAVE HEARD HIM CALL ME SON WITH WHAT WORDS SHALL I OVERTHROW HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUTH AND RECTITUDE OF HIS LONG BURIED WIFE AND MAKE HIM KNOW IN HIS OLD AGE THAT HE HAS WASTED YEARS OF PATIENCE UPON ONE WHO WAS NOT OF HIS BLOOD
BUT I DID NOT TURN AWAY REMEMBERING MY MOTHER'S ANXIETY AN ANXIETY SO EXTREME IT DISTURBED HER FINAL MOMENTS I APPROACHED THE FRONT DOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO KNOCK WHEN I FOUND IT OPEN GREATLY ASTONISHED I AT ONCE PASSED IN
IT WAS TO FIND IN TWO FACES ONLY ANY SIGNS OF THE EAGERNESS AND EXPECTANCY WHICH FILLED HIS OWN BREAST TO SUFFOCATION BUT AS THESE FACES WERE THOSE OF AGNES HALLIDAY AND AMABEL PAGE
SHE WAS TOO GOOD IT'S ALL CALUMNY A WRETCHED LIE BROKE IN UNRESTRAINED EXCITEMENT FROM EVERY PART OF THE LARGE ROOM IN VAIN THE CORONER SMOTE WITH HIS GAVEL IN VAIN THE LOCAL POLICE ENDEAVOURED TO RESTORE ORDER
IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF PLACED BUT THE MEMORY OF A THOUSAND PAST INGRATITUDES TOGETHER WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SHOCK WHICH HE COULD NOT FAIL TO RECEIVE ON LEARNING AT THIS LATE DAY
THE MEMORY OF A FACE FULL OF HOLY PLEADING ROSE FROM THE PAST BEFORE HIS EYES AND WITH AN INNER CRY OF MOTHER HE FLUNG HIS HAND OUT AND CLUTCHED HIS FATHER'S ARM IN A WAY TO BREAK THE CHARM OF HIS OWN DREAD
DID FREDERICK MOVE FORWARD THE MOMENT WAS INTENSE THE CORONER SEEMED TO SHARE THE UNIVERSAL EXCITEMENT
TRANSFORMED ME IN AN INSTANT FROM A SELFISH BRUTE INTO A DEEPLY REPENTANT MAN I KNELT BEFORE HER IN ANGUISH I MADE HER FEEL THAT WICKED AS I HAD BEEN I WAS NOT
WAS NEITHER OF HER BLOOD NOR HIS ROSE UP BETWEEN US AND CAUSED ME NOT ONLY TO ATTEMPT SILENCE BUT TO SECRETE IN THE ADJOINING WOODS THE MONEY I HAD RECEIVED IN THE VAIN HOPE THAT ALL VISIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY MOTHER'S TRAGIC DEATH
WHICH ONLY COMES FROM YEARS OF SELF CONTROL WERE TOO LATELY AWAKENED IN HIS BREAST TO SUSTAIN HIM NOW AS STROKE AFTER STROKE FELL ON THE EAR HE FELT HIMSELF YIELDING BEYOND RECOVERY
AND OF HOW ONE OF THEM JAMES BY NAME CAME TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AFFAIR WHEN I LEFT MY DEAD MOTHER'S SIDE I WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF MIND THAT I PASSED WITH SCARCELY SO MUCH AS A GLANCE THE ROOM WHERE MY NEW FOUND FATHER SAT SLEEPING
SHE DID NOT ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE ANY CORRECTIONS IN HER FORMER TESTIMONY ONLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE FLOWER WHOSE PRESENCE ON THE SCENE OF DEATH HAD BEEN SUCH A MYSTERY HAD FALLEN FROM HER HAIR AT THE BALL AND THAT SHE HAD SEEN FREDERICK PICK IT UP AND PUT IT IN HIS BUTTONHOLE
AND THE SHOCK THE SURPRISE
AND SHE MADE ME PROMISE I WOULD CARE FOR HIM TO THE LAST WITH TENDERNESS SAYING THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT SEEMING IMPROPRIETY SINCE SHE HAD WILLED ME ALL HER FORTUNE UNDER THIS PROVISO FINALLY
FROM WHICH HE HAD REMOVED THE RING WHICH UP TO THIS HOUR HE HAD INVARIABLY WORN ON HIS THIRD FINGER IN THIS GLANCE OF HERS AND THIS ACTION OF HIS BEGAN THE STRUGGLE THAT WAS TO MAKE THAT DAY MEMORABLE IN MANY HEARTS
FREDERICK HIMSELF FELT THE CHANGE AND SHOWED IT BY THE LOOK OF RELIEF AND GROWING CONFIDENCE HE CAST AT AGNES OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WHICH NOW PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE JURY I NEED GIVE NO ACCOUNT
I CANNOT SAY I KNEW SHE HAD MONEY IN HER HOUSE THIS I HAD UNHAPPILY BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH IN AN ACCIDENTAL WAY
THAT SHE WAS STILL IN THE MAZE OF THE NUMBERLESS CONFLICTING EMOTIONS WHICH THESE REVELATIONS WERE CALCULATED TO CALL OUT IN ONE WHO HAD RISKED ALL ON THE HAZARD OF A DIE AND LOST SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW AT THIS MOMENT WHETHER SHE WAS GLAD OR SORRY HE COULD EXPLAIN SO CLEVERLY
DON'T STAIN YOURS DON'T I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HER I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I THOUGHT IT OVER AFTERWARD THAT MY HAND WAS THRUST CONVULSIVELY INTO MY BREAST IN A WAY WHICH TAKEN WITH MY WILD MIEN
WHEN FREDERICK LEAPING WITH A BOUND TO HIS FEET DREW ALL EYES TOWARDS HIMSELF WITH THE CRY LET ME BE PUT ON MY OATH I HAVE TESTIMONY TO GIVE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE THE CORONER WAS ASTOUNDED
FOR SHE ROSE AND MEETING MY EYE WITH A GAZE IN WHICH SHOCK AND SOME STRANGE AND POIGNANT AGONY TOTALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME WERE STRANGELY BLENDED SHE CRIED OUT NO NO FREDERICK YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
ALL THE WITNESSES WHO HAD ANYTHING TO SAY HAD LONG AGO GIVEN IN THEIR TESTIMONY AND WHEN AT OR NEAR NOON
IN CASE MY PRESENCE IN THIS HOUSE OF DEATH SHOULD BECOME KNOWN
IT IS A SACRED STORY TO ME AND IF YOU MUST KNOW IT LET IT BE FROM HER OWN WORDS IN THE LETTERS SHE LEFT BEHIND HER SHE ONLY TOLD ME THAT TO SAVE ME FROM THE FATE OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAD PRECEDED ME
AND PRAYED ME TO SEE THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN BEFORE I SLEPT SINCE NOTHING BUT DEATH OR DIRE DISTRESS WOULD HAVE KEPT THEM FROM GRATIFYING THE ONE WHIM OF MY FATHER'S FAILING MIND I PROMISED
HESITATING STROKES RANG OUT SWEETWATER SAW FREDERICK YIELD TO A SUDDEN BUT MOST PROFOUND EMOTION THE OLD FEAR WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IF SWEETWATER DID NOT HAD AGAIN SEIZED THE VICTIM OF AMABEL'S AMBITION
THIS WAS A CONDITION OF THINGS FOR WHICH I WAS NOT PREPARED MISSUS WEBB WHOM I WISHED TO SEE WAS PROBABLY UP STAIRS AND WHILE I MIGHT SUMMON HER BY A STURDY RAP ON THE DOOR BESIDE WHICH I STOOD I HAD SO LITTLE DESIRE TO WAKE HER HUSBAND
MORE THAN THE OUTWARD SEEMING OF HER LIFE CAN HARDLY MEASURE PLUNGED AGAINST IT AND I CAN TELL YOU NO MORE HER BLOOD AND BATSY'S SHRIEK FROM THE ADJOINING ROOM SWAM THROUGH MY CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN SHE FELL AS I SUPPOSED
AND THAT SOMETHING BESIDES JUSTICE HAD ACTUATED AMABEL IN HER TREATMENT OF THIS YOUNG MAN THIS FEELING WAS SHARED BY OTHERS AND A REACTION SET IN IN FREDERICK'S FAVOUR WHICH EVEN AFFECTED THE OFFICIALS WHO WERE CONDUCTING THE INQUIRY
AND GRADUALLY SUBSIDE SO THIS CROWD YIELDED TO ITS AWE AND MAN BY MAN SANK BACK INTO HIS SEAT TILL QUIET WAS AGAIN RESTORED AND ONLY A CIRCLE OF LISTENING FACES CONFRONTED THE MAN WHO HAD JUST STIRRED A WHOLE ROOMFUL TO ITS DEPTHS
GO HE WHISPERED BUT IN SO THRILLING A TONE IT WAS HEARD TO THE REMOTEST CORNER OF THE ROOM SPARE ME THE ANGUISH OF SAYING WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IN YOUR PRESENCE I COULD NOT BEAR IT YOU COULD NOT BEAR IT LATER
WHICH TO THEIR TWO HEARTS IF TO NO OTHERS SEEMED STRANGELY APPROPRIATE FOLLOWED THE CESSATION OF THESE SOUNDS THEN THE WITNESS WAS DISMISSED AND AMABEL
AND THE FEW FINAL MINUTES BEFORE NOON PASSED BY WITHOUT ANY ADDITION BEING MADE TO THE FACTS WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN PRESENTED FOR GENERAL CONSIDERATION AS THE WITNESS SAT DOWN THE CLOCK BEGAN TO STRIKE AS THE SLOW
I SLIPPED UP THE NARROW STAIRCASE
AND SHE PRIZED EVERY MOMENT REMAINING TO HER BECAUSE OF THE BLISS SHE ENJOYED OF SEEING
WHEN FROM SOME UNKNOWN QUARTER A SINGLE CUTTING VOICE AROSE IN THIS ONE SHORT MOCKING COMMENT OH THE FAIRY TALE WAS IT AMABEL WHO SPOKE SOME THOUGHT SO AND LOOKED HER WAY
AND FLUNG IT WILDLY FROM THE WINDOW THEN I LIFTED HER AND LAID HER WHERE YOU FOUND HER ON THE SOFA
THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THAT TABLE TAKE THEM AND LET THEM PAVE YOUR WAY TO A BETTER LIFE
FOR FEAR IT WOULD MAKE HER LAST MOMENTS MISERABLE
EVER FORGOT THOUGH IT CONVEYED NO HINT OF HER REAL FEELINGS WHICH WERE SOMEWHAT CHAOTIC FREDERICK WHO HAD FORGOTTEN HER NOW THAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO SPEAK WAITED FOR THE CORONER'S REPLY IF YOU HAVE TESTIMONY
IF YOU WANT MY MONEY TAKE IT IF YOU WANT MY LIFE
SAID THAT GENTLEMAN AFTER EXCHANGING A FEW HURRIED WORDS WITH MISTER COURTNEY AND THE SURPRISED KNAPP YOU CAN DO NO BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO US AT ONCE MISTER FREDERICK SUTHERLAND WILL YOU TAKE THE STAND
THE LOVE THE PASSION
AS IF BEGGING PARDON FOR THE WICKED DOUBTS WHICH HAD DRIVEN HIM TO THIS DEFENCE FREDERICK MET THAT LOOK WITH ONE SO SEVERE IT PARTOOK OF HARSHNESS THEN RESUMING HIS TESTIMONY HE SAID
I ENCOUNTERED A MAN SITTING ASLEEP BY THE TABLE IT WAS JOHN THE ELDER OF THE TWO AND PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FOR FOOD AND IN A CONDITION OF EXTREME MISERY I TOOK OUT THE FIRST BILL MY HAND ENCOUNTERED
AND THOUGH HER STRENGTH AND BREATH WERE FAST FAILING HER SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE ZABELS WHO HAD NOT COME ACCORDING TO A SACRED CUSTOM BETWEEN THEM TO CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER WEDDING
SEEING THIS AND REALISING HIS OPPORTUNITY FREDERICK AT ONCE ENTERED INTO THE EXPLANATIONS FOR WHICH EACH HEART THERE PANTED THIS WILL BE OVERWHELMING NEWS TO HIM WHO HAS CARED FOR ME SINCE INFANCY
OR THAT I WAS THE SPECIAL OBJECT OF HER ATTENTION OR THAT WE WERE UNDER ANY MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN ANY WAY WHY THEN I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING TO HER IN THE GREAT STRAIT IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF ON THAT DAY
HAS TAKEN PAINS TO DECLARE TO YOU THAT IN THE EXPEDITION SHE HERSELF MADE INTO TOWN THAT EVENING SHE FOLLOWED SOME PERSON'S STEPS DOWN HILL THIS IS VERY LIKELY TRUE AND THOSE STEPS WERE PROBABLY MINE FOR AFTER LEAVING THE HOUSE BY THE GARDEN DOOR
WHICH MADE ANY ATTEMPT SEEM REASONABLE THAT PROMISED RELIEF FROM THE UNENDURABLE BURDEN OF A PRESSING AND DISREPUTABLE DEBT I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE MONEY A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND I HAD TO HAVE IT AT ONCE
AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES CALCULATED TO DECEIVE MISTER SUTHERLAND CONSEQUENTLY HE HAD NEVER KNOWN I WAS NOT HIS OWN CHILD
NOTHING BUT SHAME AND DISASTER AWAITED ME YET HOW COULD I HOPE TO LURE HER DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT NOISE I COULD NOT AND SO YIELDING TO THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT WITHOUT ANY REALISATION
THIS YOU WILL BELIEVE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I WAS THE PERSON MISS PAGE FOLLOWED INTO MISSUS WEBB'S HOUSE AND WHOM SHE HEARD DESCEND THE STAIRS DURING THE MOMENT SHE CROUCHED BEHIND THE FIGURE OF THE SLEEPING PHILEMON IT WAS MORE
EVERYONE WAS ASTOUNDED NO ONE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING FROM HIM AND INSTINCTIVELY EVERY EYE TURNED TOWARDS AMABEL TO SEE HOW SHE WAS AFFECTED BY HIS ACTION STRANGELY EVIDENTLY
SEEMED APPEAR FOR THE MOMENT PLAUSIBLE AND BATSY ASKED THE CORONER MUST HAVE FALLEN WHEN WE DID FOR I NEVER HEARD HER VOICE AFTER THE FIRST SCREAM BUT I SHALL SPEAK OF HER AGAIN
I SAW THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WITH HIS HEAD SUNK FORWARD ON HIS ARMS ASLEEP THE EXPECTED GUESTS HAD FAILED TO ARRIVE AND HE TIRED OUT WITH WAITING HAD FALLEN INTO A DOZE AT THE BOARD
INFINITELY MORE THAN ANYONE THERE HAD EXPECTED
SHE DID NOT REGRET HER FATAL ACT VIOLENT AND UNCALLED FOR AS IT WAS FOR IT HAD SHOWED HER MY HEART AND ALLOWED ME TO READ HERS
WHAT I MUST NOW EXPLAIN IS HOW THE MONEY IN MISSUS WEBB'S DRAWER CAME INTO MY POSSESSION AND HOW THE DAGGER SHE HAD PLANTED IN HER BREAST CAME TO BE FOUND ON THE LAWN OUTSIDE WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF AND THAT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY SOON I FOUND
SHE ROSE WITH A BOUND NOUGHT THAT SHE HAD ANTICIPATED HAD OCCURRED FACTS OF WHICH SHE COULD KNOW NOTHING HAD CHANGED THE ASPECT OF AFFAIRS AND MADE THE POSITION OF FREDERICK SOMETHING SO REMOTE FROM ANY SHE COULD HAVE IMAGINED
THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE MADE THEMSELVES HEARD IN DESPITE OF THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE PLACE AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE POLICE TO FREDERICK IT WAS A MOMENT OF IMMEASURABLE GRIEF AND HUMILIATION
YET HOW THRILLING IT HAD BEEN TO HEAR HIM PLEAD HIS CAUSE SO WELL IT WAS ALMOST WORTH THE LOSS OF HER REVENGE TO MEET HIS LOOK OF HATE AND DREAM OF THE POSSIBILITY OF TURNING IT LATER INTO THE OLD LOOK OF LOVE YES YES SHE LOVED HIM NOW
DO THESE WORDS THIS ACTION OF HERS SEEM INCREDIBLE TO YOU SIRS ALAS ALAS THEY WILL NOT WHEN I TELL YOU AND HERE HE CAST ONE ANXIOUS DEEPLY ANXIOUS GLANCE AT THE ROOM IN WHICH MISTER SUTHERLAND WAS HIDDEN
BUT WAS TOO TERRIFIED TO MOVE OR SPEAK AND THIS SATISFIED MY MOTHER AND MADE HER LAST BREATH ONE OF TRUST AND CONTENTED LOVE SHE DIED AS I DREW THE DAGGER FROM HER BREAST
AS I HAD BEEN TOLD EARLY IN THE EVENING A SMALL ENTERTAINMENT WAS BEING GIVEN WHICH WOULD INSURE ITS BEING OPEN EVEN AT SO LATE AN HOUR AS MIDNIGHT MISS PAGE WHO WILL I AM SURE PARDON THE INTRODUCTION OF HER NAME INTO THIS NARRATIVE
WERE HE LOVER HUSBAND OR SON SO AMABEL BELIEVED AND SO WOULD THESE OTHERS BELIEVE ALSO WHEN ONCE RELIEVED OF THE MAGNETIC PERSONALITY OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY WITNESS
BUT AS I HASTENED ON TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE ZABELS LIVED I WAS SEIZED BY SUCH COMPUNCTION FOR HIS DESOLATE STATE THAT I FALTERED IN MY RAPID FLIGHT AND DID NOT ARRIVE AT THE PLACE OF MY DESTINATION AS QUICKLY AS I INTENDED WHEN I DID
AND SO HASTENED ON TILL I CAME TO THE GATE ON HIGH STREET HERE I HAD A MOMENT OF HESITATION AND THOUGHTS BITTER ENOUGH FOR ME TO RECALL THEM AT THIS MOMENT CAME INTO MY MIND
HOW CONDUCT HERSELF UNDER QUESTIONS WHICH WOULD BE MUCH MORE SEARCHING NOW THAN BEFORE SHE COULD NOT EVEN DECIDE IN HER OWN MIND SHE MUST LET IMPULSE HAVE ITS WAY HAPPILY SHE TOOK THE RIGHT STAND AT FIRST
BEYOND THIS AND THE INFERENCES IT AFTERWARD AWAKENED IN HER MIND SHE WOULD NOT GO
THE ASTOUNDING FACT WHICH I HAVE JUST COMMUNICATED TO YOU WAS MADE KNOWN BY MY MOTHER WITH THE DAGGER STILL PLUNGED IN HER BREAST SHE WOULD NOT LET ME DRAW IT OUT SHE KNEW THAT DEATH WOULD FOLLOW THAT ACT
OF WHOSE MENTAL CONDITION I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO MAKE ANY LOUD NOISE WITHIN HIS HEARING YET I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO RETREAT ALL MY HOPE OF RELIEF FROM THE MANY DIFFICULTIES THAT MENACED ME
BUT THOSE DEAREST TO HIM IN DISGRACE AND SORROW HE FELT HIMSELF WEAKEN TO THE POINT OF CLUTCHING AT WHATEVER WOULD SAVE HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONFESSION MORAL STRENGTH AND THAT TENACITY OF PURPOSE
THEY BUT EMPHASISED FACTS ALREADY KNOWN AND PRODUCED BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN THE GENERAL FEELING
ON EVERY FACE IN EVERY SHRINKING FORM IN SUBDUED MURMURS AND OPEN CRIES HE READ INSTANT AND COMPLETE CONDEMNATION AND YET IN ALL HIS LIFE FROM BOYHOOD UP TO THIS HOUR NEVER HAD HE BEEN SO WORTHY OF THEIR ESTEEM AND CONSIDERATION
BUT THEY PASSED THANK GOD AND WITH NO MORE DESPERATE FEELING THAN A SULLEN INTENTION OF HAVING MY OWN WAY ABOUT THIS MONEY I LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE FRONT DOOR AND STEPPED IN
BUT WHEN I ROSE TO LOOK FOR BATSY I FOUND THAT THE SHOCK OF HER MISTRESS'S FATAL ACT HAD KILLED HER
DOCTOR TALBOT AND YOU GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY IN THE FACE OF GOD AND MAN I HERE DECLARE THAT MISSUS WEBB IN MY PRESENCE AND BEFORE MY EYES
OF AMABEL SMOOTHING OUT THE FOLDS OF HER CRISP WHITE FROCK WITH AN INCREDULOUS ALMOST INSULTING SMILE THAT AT ONCE FIXED ATTENTION AGAIN ON FREDERICK HE SEIZED THE OCCASION AND SPOKE UP IN A TONE OF GREAT RESOLVE
FOR WHILE SHE HAD HITHERTO SAT UNDER THE UNIVERSAL GAZE WITH ONLY THE FAINT SMILE OF CONSCIOUS BEAUTY ON HER INSCRUTABLE FEATURES
I HAVE MADE AN ASSERTION SAID HE BEFORE GOD AND BEFORE THIS JURY TO MAKE IT SEEM A CREDIBLE ONE I SHALL HAVE TO TELL MY OWN STORY FROM THE BEGINNING AM I ALLOWED TO DO SO MISTER CORONER YOU ARE
AND SEEING MY WAY PERFECTLY IN THE MOONLIGHT ENTERED THE ROOM ON THE LEFT THE DOOR OF WHICH ALSO STOOD OPEN IT WAS THE SECOND HOUSE I HAD ENTERED UNANNOUNCED THAT NIGHT AND IN THIS AS IN THE OTHER
SHE HAD NOT A PURE ENOUGH HEART TO DO SO TO HER ALL SELF SACRIFICE WAS AN ANOMALY NO WOMAN OF THE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF AGATHA WEBB WOULD PLANT A DAGGER IN HER OWN BREAST JUST TO PREVENT ANOTHER PERSON FROM COMMITTING A CRIME
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR YONDER THAT SHE HAD REASONS FOR THIS GOOD REASONS REASONS OF WHICH UP TO THE VERY EVENING OF HER DEATH
SHE POINTED TO THE DAGGER IN HER BREAST BUT BEFORE I COULD LAY MY HAND UPON IT SHE CALLED FOR BATSY I WANT HER TO HEAR ME DECLARE BEFORE I GO SAID SHE THAT THIS STROKE WAS DELIVERED BY MYSELF UPON MYSELF
THAT THE BLOW OF WHICH I HAD BEEN SUCH A HORRIFIED WITNESS HAD NOT YET PROVED FATAL THE EYES I HAD SEEN CLOSE AS I HAD SUPPOSED FOREVER WERE NOW OPEN AND SHE WAS LOOKING AT ME WITH A SMILE THAT HAS NEVER LEFT MY MEMORY AND NEVER WILL
AND END FOREVER THE EFFECTS OF THE INTOLERABLE FASCINATION THAT WAS WORKING UPON HIM NEXT MINUTE THE LAST STROKE OF NOON RANG OUT AND THE HOUR WAS UP WHICH AMABEL HAD SET AS THE LIMIT OF HER SILENCE A PAUSE
AND ENGLAND MIGHT HAVE MADE GOOD HER CLAIM TO THE TERRITORY WHICH IS NOW OREGON AND WASHINGTON AND IDAHO VANCOUVER'S SHIPS WERE GLIDING INTO THE STRAIT OF JUAN DE FUCA
HAD BEEN SEIZED BY THE SPANISH AT NOOTKA THOUGH THE FACT HAD NOT BEEN TRUMPETED TO THE WORLD THE SPANISH SAID THAT THEIR PILOTS HAD EXPLORED THESE COASTS AS EARLY AS SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE AT LEAST THREE YEARS BEFORE COOK'S LANDING AT NOOTKA
THEY CROSSED FROM THE HEAD WATERS OF THE PARSNIP TO THE SOUTH FORK OF THE FRASER
POSSIBLY BE THE COLUMBIA THE TIDE ROSE AND FELL IN THE RIVER THE INDIAN GUIDE BEGGED THE WHITE MEN NOT TO GO ON HE WAS AFRAID HE SAID OF THE INDIANS OF THE SEA COAST THE RIVER CHANNEL DIVIDED
JUST AS THE BOSTONNAIS WERE SAILING OUT FOR A LAST RUN UP THE COAST THERE GLIDED INTO NOOTKA SOUND A PROUD SHIP ALL SAILS SET TWENTY CANNON POINTED SPANISH COLOURS SPREAD TO THE BREEZE
WHEN THE RIVER TURNED SHARPLY WEST FRASER COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT THE INDIANS BECAME MORE VIOLENTLY HOSTILE FAR SOUTH COULD BE SEEN THE OPAL DOME OF MOUNT BAKER NAMED BY VANCOUVER AFTER ONE OF HIS LIEUTENANTS
IF THE BOSTONNAIS WOULD GO ASHORE TO TRADE GRAY SLAPPED THE OLD RASCAL ACROSS THE FACE THE INDIAN WAS OVER THE SIDE AT A PLUNGE AND THE MARAUDERS WERE SEEN NO MORE IN SPITE OF THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS IT PRESENTED
BUT IF ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS COUNT THESE PILOTS WITH THEIR RAGGED PEON CREWS HALF BLOODS OF AZTEC WOMAN AND SPANISH ADVENTURER DESERVE HIGHER RANK IN THE ROLL OF PACIFIC COAST EXPLORATION
IN JUNE SEVENTEEN NINETY ONE GRAY WAS OUT AGAIN ON THE COLUMBIA THIS TIME HE WENT AS FAR NORTH AS THE PORTLAND CANAL PAST THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS WHERE HE MET KENDRICK ON THE LADY WASHINGTON
OF THE COAST NORTHWARD FROM VANCOUVER ISLAND TO THE RUSSIAN SETTLEMENTS SMALL RINGING OF BELLS NO BLARING OF TRUMPETS AT ALL PRAYERS A PLENTY BUT LITTLE AMMUNITION AND LESS FOOD
THE FINEST RESIDENCES OF THE CANADIAN PACIFIC COAST STAND THERE AND THE RIVER IS LINED WITH MILE UPON MILE OF LUMBER YARDS AND SAW MILLS
QUESNEL ARRIVED AT FORT SAINT JAMES IN THE AUTUMN BRINGING FROM THE EAST THE ALARMING WORD THAT LEWIS AND CLARK HAD GONE OVERLAND AND TAKEN POSSESSION OF ALL THE TERRITORY BETWEEN THE MISSOURI AND THE MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA
BUT THE INDIANS WERE HOWLING LIKE WOLVES AND BRANDISHING WAR CLUBS AND FRASER CONCLUDED
AND ENGLISH GUNS MADE ANSWER A CURIOUS FASHION
WHAT WOULD HAVE PROVED AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY THE MOUTH OF THE FRASER RIVER SOME DISTANCE NORTH OF BURRARD INLET
THE WHIRLPOOL FORCED HER AGAINST A LOW ROCK UPON THIS THE MEN SCRAMBLED OUT SAVING THEIR LIVES
FOR SOME TIME THERE WERE MUTTERINGS OF WAR BUT AT LENGTH DIPLOMACY PREVAILED ENGLAND DEMANDED AMONG OTHER THINGS THE RESTORATION OF THE BUILDINGS AND THE LAND AND FULL REPARATION FOR ALL LOSSES
ELISA SENT THEM ALL HOME TO MEXICO ON FURLOUGH AND ON HEARING THEIR REPORT THE VICEROY OF MEXICO ORDERED OUT TWO SHIPS THE SUTIL AND THE MEXICANA DON GALIANO AND DON VALDES IN COMMAND TO FOLLOW UP THE CHARTING
WHILE THE OTHERS SLEPT AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THE LITTLE PARTY WAS SURROUNDED BY FEROCIOUSLY HOSTILE BANDS BETWEEN APPREHENSION OF THE DANGERS OF THE WILD TRAIL OF THE FRASER CANYONS AND FEAR OF HOSTILE NATIVES THE MEN BECAME SO PANIC STRICKEN
AND MAQUINNA LORD OF THE WILDS ATTENDED THE FEAST DRESSED INDIAN FASHION BUT WHEN THE SPANISH DON AND THE ENGLISH OFFICER TOOK BREATH FROM FLOW OF COMPLIMENTS AND WINE THEY DID NOT SEEM TO ARRIVE ANYWHERE IN THEIR NEGOTIATIONS
DISAPPOINTMENT IT WAS THE SPRING OF SEVENTEEN NINETY TWO THE SPANIARD ELISA OF NOOTKA HAD FOR A YEAR KEPT HIS PILOT NARVAEZ
NO TIME WAS TO BE LOST BY FRASER IN ESTABLISHING A CLAIM TO THE REGION TO THE WEST OF THE ROCKIES BETWEEN THE PEACE AND THE COLUMBIA FRASER WENT DOWN THE RIVER AND STRENGTHENED BRITISH POSSESSION BY BUILDING A FOURTH FORT
HOWEVER WE CLEARED THE BANK BEFORE DARK THE MEN HAD TO ASCEND THE IMMENSE HILLS WITH HEAVY LOADS ON THEIR BACKS INDIANS WARNED THE WHITE MEN TO DESIST FROM THEIR UNDERTAKING
AND COVERED WITH UNDERBRUSH AND MOSS THE PARTY ON JUNE ELEVENTH BEGAN THEIR TRAMP DOWN THE RIVER BANK EACH MAN CARRIED ON HIS BACK A NINETY POUND PACK SUPPORTED BY A STRAP ACROSS THE FOREHEAD
PRESENTED THEM WITH SPICES AND WINES AND ALLOWED THEM TO DEPART UNMOLESTED WHEN THE AMERICANS RETURNED FROM THE RUN UP COAST THEY FOUND THE ENGLISH FORT DISMANTLED A SPANISH FORT ERECTED ON HOG ISLAND AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SOUND
A PLACE LATER TO BE MADE FAMOUS BY TRAGEDY SOUTH OF NOOTKA HERE THEY BUILT A STOCKADED FUR POST FOR THEMSELVES WHICH THEY NAMED FORT DEFENCE DURING THE WINTER THEY BUILT AND LAUNCHED A LITTLE COASTING SCHOONER THE ADVENTURE
WITH A LARGE PACKAGE ON HIS BACK HE GOT SO WEDGED AMID THE ROCKS THAT HE COULD MOVE NEITHER FORWARD NOR BACKWARD NOR YET UNLOAD HIMSELF I CRAWLED NOT WITHOUT GREAT RISK TO HIS ASSISTANCE
AN EXAMINATION OF THE RIVER FOR SOME DISTANCE BELOW CONVINCED FRASER THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE OF NAVIGATION AND HE DECIDED TO MAKE THE REMAINDER OF THE JOURNEY ON FOOT AFTER BUILDING A SCAFFOLD ON WHICH THE CANOES AND SOME PROVISIONS WERE PLACED
NATIVES ALONG THE SHORE BEGAN SINGING WAR SONGS AND BEATING THE WAR DRUM THEN THEY CIRCLED OUT THREATENINGLY ROUND THE WHITE MEN'S BOATS SIGNS WERE SEEN OF THE SEA AHEAD
WHAT TROUBLED FRASER MOST WAS THE FACT THAT THE RIVER LAY MANY MILES NORTH OF THE KNOWN LATITUDE OF THE COLUMBIA
SPAIN DECIDED TO SUBMIT AND ACCORDINGLY THE NOOTKA CONVENTION WAS SIGNED BY THE TWO POWERS IN OCTOBER SEVENTEEN NINETY TWO SHIPS THE DISCOVERY AND THE CHATHAM WERE THEN FITTED OUT BY THE BRITISH ADMIRALTY
THE INDIANS DECLARED THAT THE SEA LAY ONLY TEN SLEEPS DISTANT ONE OF THE CHIEFS SAID THAT HE HAD HIMSELF SEEN WHITE MEN WHO WERE GREAT TYEES BECAUSE
TO CONTINUE BY WATER WOULD BE CERTAIN DESTRUCTION DURING THIS DISTRESSING SCENE WE WERE ON SHORE LOOKING ON BUT THE SITUATION RENDERED OUR APPROACH PERILOUS THE BANK WAS HIGH AND STEEP
WHO AS A CHILD HAD COME FROM THE UNITED STATES TO CANADA WITH HIS WIDOWED MOTHER IN THE LOYALIST MIGRATION AND NOW IN HIS THIRTIETH YEAR WAS A PARTNER IN THE NORTH WEST COMPANY OF MONTREAL HAD CROSSED THE ROCKIES BY WAY OF THE PEACE RIVER
THEY THOUGHT THE WHITE MEN IN SMOKING WERE EMITTING SPIRITS WITH EACH BREATH WHEN THE TRADERS OFFERED SOAP TO THE SQUAWS THE WOMEN AT ONCE BEGAN TO DEVOUR IT
WHEN THEY MET A SQUARE HULLED TRIM LITTLE TRADER UNDER THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES IT WAS THE COLUMBIA COMMANDED BY ROBERT GRAY THE AMERICAN TOLD AN ASTOUNDING STORY
VANCOUVER SPENT YET ANOTHER YEAR ON THE NORTH PACIFIC CORROBORATING HIS FIRST YEAR'S CHARTING AND PROVING
AFTER SENDING THE YEAR'S FURS FROM ROCKY MOUNTAIN PORTAGE EAST TO FORT CHIPEWYAN SIMON FRASER SET OUT TO EXPLORE THIS INLAND EMPIRE CONCERNING WHICH M'DOUGALL HAD REPORTED JOHN STUART ACCOMPANIED FRASER AS LIEUTENANT
THE VOYAGEURS AGAIN EMBARKED AND SWEPT DOWN THE NARROW BENDS OF THE TURBULENT FLOODS AT WHAT ARE NOW LYTTON YALE AND HOPE THERE WERE PASSES WHERE THE RIVER WAS SUCH A RAGING TORRENT
CHARTING NORTH EAST PAST THE HARBOUR OF VICTORIA THROUGH HARO STRAIT FOLLOWING VERY MUCH THE SAME CHANNEL THAT STEAMERS FOLLOW TO DAY AS THEY PLY BETWEEN VICTORIA AND VANCOUVER EAST OF A HIGH ISLAND
AND SWEPT VIOLENTLY BETWEEN TWO OVERHANGING PRECIPICES THE WATER WHICH ROLLS DOWN THIS PASSAGE IN TUMULTUOUS WAVES AND WITH GREAT VELOCITY HAD A FRIGHTFUL APPEARANCE
AGAIN A FORT WAS ERECTED AND NAMED FORT FRASER MAKING THREE FORTS IN THE INTERIOR OF NEW CALEDONIA FRASER HAD SENT A REQUEST TO THE DIRECTORS OF THE NORTH WEST COMPANY TO BE PERMITTED
THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS FRASER REASONED AND REMONSTRATED AND FINALLY THREATENED AFTER SO MUCH HEROISM HE WOULD NOT PERMIT COWARDLY DESERTION THEN HE FORCED EACH VOYAGEUR TO SWEAR ON THE CROSS
CLAPPING HIS HANDS TO HIS HIPS AND STRUTTING ABOUT WITH AN AIR OF VAST IMPORTANCE THE INDIANS TOLD FRASER OF ANOTHER GREAT RIVER THAT CAME IN FROM THE EAST AND JOINED THIS ONE SOME DISTANCE BELOW HE HAD PASSED THE SITE OF THE PRESENT
EVERY INLET OF THE TORTUOUS COASTS WAS PENETRATED AND SURVEYED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT NO PASSAGE TO THE NORTH EAST LAY THROUGH THESE WATERS IN JUNE THE EXPLORERS PASSED UP THE STRAIT OF GEORGIA
WHERE THE INDIANS CAMPED THE NATIVES HERE WARNED FRASER THAT IT WOULD BE MADNESS TO GO FORWARD AT THE SAME TIME THEY FURNISHED HIM WITH A GUIDE
WERE NOT FAIR JUDGES OF EACH OTHER'S FEATS VANCOUVER TOOK POSSESSION OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER REGION FOR ENGLAND SETTING DOWN IN HIS NARRATIVE
WE HAD TO PLUNGE OUR DAGGERS INTO THE GROUND TO AVOID SLIDING INTO THE RIVER WE CUT STEPS FASTENED A LINE TO THE FRONT OF THE CANOE AND HAULED IT UP OUR LIVES HUNG UPON A THREAD AS ONE FALSE STEP MIGHT HAVE HURLED US INTO ETERNITY
THE QUARREL AT NOOTKA BETWEEN THE ENGLISH AND THE SPANIARDS WAS STILL GOING ON SO THIS AUTUMN THE TWO BOSTONNAIS ANCHORED FOR THE WINTER
FORT GEORGE AT THE MOUTH OF THE NECHACO THIS WAS TO BE THE STARTING POINT OF THE EXPEDITION TO THE PACIFIC
HAD EVER ENTERED THIS RIVER BEFORE IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT MISTER GRAY EITHER SAW OR WAS EVER WITHIN FIVE LEAGUES OF THE ENTRANCE VANCOUVER THEN VISITED THE PRESIDIO AT SAN FRANCISCO AND THENCE PROCEEDED TO MONTEREY
VANCOUVER WAS ANXIOUS TO BE OFF ON FURTHER EXPLORATION HE WAS EAGER TO VERIFY THE EXISTENCE OF THE RIVER WHICH GRAY HAD REPORTED HE SPENT MOST OF OCTOBER EXPLORING THIS RIVER EXPLORERS IN THAT DAY AS IN THIS
SUCH AS WE TO DAY SEE IN STANLEY PARK VANCOUVER THE RIVER SWEPT DOWN BEHIND A DEEP HARBOUR WITH FORESTED HEIGHTS BETWEEN RIVER MOUTH AND ROADSTEAD
VANCOUVER REFUSED TO CREDIT THE NEWS YET THERE WAS THE SHIP'S LOG THERE WERE THE DETAILS LANDMARKS SOUNDINGS ANCHORAGES FOR TWENTY MILES UP THE COLUMBIA FROM ITS MOUTH GRAY HAD INDEED BEEN UP THE RIVER AND HAD CROSSED THE BAR
BUT WHEN THE POOR MEXICAN PEONS SET OUT THEY HAD NOTHING BEHIND THEM BUT THE BRANDING IRON OR SLAVERY IN THE MINES IF THEY FAILED YET THEY SANG AS THEY SAILED THEIR RICKETY DEATH TRAPS AND THEY LAUGHED AS THEY ROWED AND WHEN THE TIDE RIP CAUGHT THEM
WHERE HOLIDAY FOLK NOW HAVE THEIR SUMMER CAMPS PILOT NARVAEZ CAME ON THE ESTUARY OF A GREAT RIVER WHICH HE CALLED BOCA DE FLORIDA BLANCA
WHERE SHE WAS WHIRLED ABOUT IN SUSPENSE WHETHER TO SINK OR SWIM HOWEVER SHE TOOK A TURN FROM THIS VORTEX FLYING FROM ONE DANGER TO ANOTHER
THEY SANK WITHOUT A CRY TO ANY BUT THE VIRGIN LOOK AT A MAP OF THE WEST COAST OF THE PACIFIC FROM THE HORN TO SITKA FIRST WERE THE SPANIARDS AT EVERY HARBOUR GATE AND YET TO DAY OF ALL THEIR DEEP SEA FINDINGS ON THAT COAST
AND DURING THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN O SIX M'DOUGALL HAD CROSSED THE HEAVILY DRIFTED CARRYING PLACE AND DESCENDED THE BAD RIVER AS FAR AS THE SOUTH FORK OF THE FRASER WHICH ALL TRADERS AT THAT TIME MISTOOK FOR THE UPPER REACHES OF GRAY'S COLUMBIA
THE FORT COULD NOT BE DEFENDED AGAINST SUCH A NUMBER OF ENEMIES FOR THERE WERE NOT TWENTY MEN WITHIN THE WALLS GRAY HASTILY GOT THE COLUMBIA READY FOR SEA
THE DESCENT OF THE FRASER RIVER AMERICAN TRADERS WERE NOT SLOW TO FOLLOW UP THE DISCOVERY OF ROBERT GRAY ON THE PACIFIC
AND THE GROUND WAS CLEARED FOR A PALISADED FORT WHICH WHEN ERECTED THEY NAMED FORT SAINT JAMES THE SCENE WAS ENCHANTING THE LAKE WOUND FOR A DISTANCE OF FIFTY MILES AMID THE FOOT HILLS OF THE MIGHTY FORESTED MOUNTAINS
UP AT NOOTKA THE SPANIARD GONZALES DE HARO HAD REPLACED MARTINEZ AND HIS COUNTRYMEN QUIMPER AND ELISA WERE DAILY EXPLORING ON THE EAST SIDE OF VANCOUVER ISLAND
A THIRD LARGER THAN GERMANY BETWEEN MACKENZIE'S TRAIL WESTWARD AND LEWIS AND CLARK'S TRAIL TO THE MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA IN EIGHTEEN O FIVE SIMON FRASER
DON QUADRA BREAKFASTED CAPTAIN VANCOUVER
THE WHITE MEN WERE AIDED BY THE INLAND CARRIERS THEY FOUND THE CANOES AND SUPPLIES IN PERFECT CONDITION AND UNMOLESTED
IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THE SCENE THE TURBID MAD WATERS OF THE FRASER HEMMED IN BETWEEN ROCK WALLS CARVING A LIVING WAY THROUGH THE ADAMANT BANKS FROM WHICH RED SAVAGES THREW DOWN ROCKS
THE WHOLE CITY OF BOSTON WELCOMED THE COLUMBIA HOME IN THE AUTUMN OF SEVENTEEN NINETY
FARTHER DOWN EUROPEAN ARTICLES WERE SEEN AMONG THE INDIANS IT WAS THE FISHING SEASON AND THE TRIBES HAD ASSEMBLED IN GREAT HORDES HERE THE RIVER WAS NAVIGABLE AND THREE WOODEN DUG OUTS WERE OBTAINED FROM THE NATIVES FOR THE DESCENT TO THE SEA
AND IF HE DID NOT ACTUALLY BEHOLD THE BEAUTIFUL ALPINE TARNS SINCE KNOWN AS FRASER LAKE AND STUART LAKE HE WAS AT LEAST THE FIRST WHITE MAN TO HEAR OF THEM IN MAY OF EIGHTEEN O SIX
WHICH THE VICEROY OF MEXICO HAD SENT OUT THE SUTIL AND THE MEXICANA COMMANDED RESPECTIVELY BY DON GALIANO AND DON VALDES FROM THEM VANCOUVER LEARNED THAT DON QUADRA THE SPANISH REPRESENTATIVE
AND SAVED HIS LIFE BY CUTTING HIS PACK SO THAT IT DROPPED BACK IN THE RIVER ON THIS CARRYING PLACE WHICH WAS TWO MILES LONG OUR SHOES BECAME SHATTERED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THIS
CERTAINLY FROM NEW ORLEANS TO THE MISSOURI DID IT ALSO INCLUDE FROM THE MISSOURI TO GRAY'S RIVER THE COLUMBIA THE UNITED STATES HAD SENT MERIWETHER LEWIS AND WILLIAM CLARK OVERLAND FROM THE MISSOURI TO THE COLUMBIA
WHERE QUADRA AWAITED HIM HIS LIEUTENANT BROUGHTON WHO HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE BOATS THAT EXPLORED THE COLUMBIA HERE LEFT HIM AND ACCOMPANIED QUADRA TO SAN BLAS WHENCE HE WENT OVERLAND TO THE ATLANTIC AND SAILED FOR ENGLAND BEARING DISPATCHES TO THE GOVERNMENT
AS IF NATURE HAD PURPOSELY INTERPOSED TO GUARD THIS HARBOUR AGAINST THE DEPOSIT OF SILT BORNE DOWN BY THE MIGHTY STREAM TO DAY A BOULEVARD RISES FROM THE LAND LOCKED HARBOUR AND GOES OVER THE HEIGHTS TO THE RIVER MOUTH LIKE THE ARC OF A BOW
THE SAME EVENING THE PARTY REACHED THE PLACE DESCRIBED BY FRASER AS A CONTINUAL SERIES OF CASCADES CUT BY ROCKS AND BOUNDED BY PRECIPICES
AND THE DIFFICULTY CONSISTED IN KEEPING THE CANOES CLEAR OF THE PRECIPICE ON ONE SIDE AND CLEAR OF THE GULFS FORMED BY THE WAVES ON THE OTHER THUS SKIMMING ALONG AS FAST AS LIGHTNING THE CREWS COOL AND DETERMINED
WAS AWAITING HIM AT NOOTKA PREPARED TO RESTORE THE FORTS AND PROPERTY
WAS THE COLUMBIA WITH THE HELP OF INDIANS THE CANOES WERE PULLED UP HILL AND HORSES WERE HIRED FROM THEM TO CARRY THE PROVISIONS OVERLAND BELOW THIS PORTAGE AS THEY CONTINUED THE DESCENT
AGAIN AND AGAIN ON THE JOURNEY INDIANS CONFRONTED FRASER WITH HOSTILE SHOW OF WEAPONS BUT THE INTREPID TRADER DISARMED HOSTILITY BY GIFTS
HISTORY DOES NOT RECORD WHETHER THE WOMEN BECAME AS ADDICTED TO SOAP AS THE MEN TO THE FRAGRANT WEED ACTIVE TRADING WITH THE INDIANS BEGAN AT ONCE THE LAKE WAS NAMED STUART IN HONOUR OF FRASER'S COMPANION
STRANGE THAT THE SPANIARDS SHOULD LOOK ON COMPLAISANTLY WHILE ENGLISH TRADERS FROM CHINA MEARES AND HANNA AND BARKLEY AND DOUGLAS WERE TAKING POSSESSION OF NOOTKA THE ANSWER CAME UNEXPECTEDLY
MACKENZIE HAD CROSSED OVERLAND FROM THE PEACE RIVER TO BELLA COOLA
WHO HAD BEEN ON THE PACIFIC WITH COOK IT WAS APRIL SEVENTEEN NINETY TWO WHEN VANCOUVER CAME UP ABREAST OF CAPE DISAPPOINTMENT WAS IT CHANCE OR FATE
THE SPANISH FRIGATES FAIRLY BRISTLED WITH CANNON AN ENGLISH OFFICER DRESSED IN REGIMENTALS MARCHED TO THE SPANISH FORT AND PRESENTED CAPTAIN VANCOUVER'S COMPLIMENTS TO DON QUADRA SPANISH CANNON THUNDERED A WELCOME THAT SHOOK THE HILLS
WE RESOLVED TO VENTURE DOWN I ORDERED THE FIVE BEST MEN OF THE CREWS INTO A CANOE LIGHTLY LOADED AND IN A MOMENT IT WAS UNDER WAY AFTER PASSING THE FIRST CASCADE SHE LOST HER HEAD AND WAS DRAWN INTO AN EDDY
IT WAS FOUR OR FIVE MILES WIDE AND WAS GEMMED WITH GREEN ISLETS AND ALL ROUND APPEARING THROUGH THE CLOUDS IN JAGGED OUTLINE WERE THE OPAL SUMMITS OF THE SNOWY PEAKS
OSTENSIBLY ON A SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION BUT IN REALITY TO LAY CLAIM TO THE NEW TERRITORY FOR THE UNITED STATES THIS BRINGS THE EXPLORATION OF THE PACIFIC DOWN TO EIGHTEEN O SIX TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAP
HE SAILED AWAY FOR MONTEREY WHILE ELISA REMAINED AT NOOTKA GRAY KNEW THAT THREE ENGLISH VESSELS WHICH HAD COME FROM CHINA FOR FURS COLNETT'S ARGONAUT DOUGLAS'S
ACCORDING TO VANCOUVER BUT LITTLE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YARDS IN EXTENT ANY WAY NO UNDERSTANDING COULD BE ARRIVED AT AND QUADRA AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER TOOK HIS DEPARTURE FOR MONTEREY LEAVING VANCOUVER TO FOLLOW A FEW DAYS LATER
BUT SHE WAS MISTRESS OF THE SEAS AND HAD BEEN SINCE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ARMADA AND AS MISTRESS OF THE SEAS SHE COULD NOT TOLERATE AS MUCH AS THE SEIZURE OF A FISHING SMACK
HE HAD FOLLOWED MACKENZIE'S TRAIL OVER THE TERRIBLE NINE MILE CARRYING PLACE AND HAD BUILT THERE A FUR POST ROCKY MOUNTAIN PORTAGE HE HAD ASCENDED THAT SAME PARSNIP RIVER WHICH MACKENZIE HAD FOUND SO APPALLING
CROWDING AND THE SCHOONER ALMOST FALLING TO PIECES CAME CRAWLING BACK TO NOOTKA THE POOR MEXICANS WERE UTTERLY UNAWARE THAT THEY HAD DISCOVERED A GATEWAY FOR NORTHERN EMPIRE NARVAEZ HIMSELF LAY ALMOST UNCONSCIOUS IN HIS BERTH
AND DOUGLAS'S SHIP THE COMPANION OF MEARES'S VESSEL HELD CAPTIVE BY THE SPANIARD GRAY AND KENDRICK NOW EXCHANGED SHIPS AND SAILED FOR CHINA TO DISPOSE OF THEIR CARGOES OF FURS AND RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE CARGOES OF TEA FOR BOSTON
THE MEN PASSED AND REPASSED A DECLIVITY ON LOOSE STONES AND GRAVEL WHICH CONSTANTLY GAVE WAY UNDER FOOT ONE MAN WHO LOST THE PATH GOT IN A MOST INTRICATE AND PERILOUS POSITION
THE CAPTAIN OF THIS VESSEL DON JOSEPH MARTINEZ TOOK A LOOK AT THE ENGLISH FORTIFICATIONS AND ANOTHER AT THE AMERICANS THE AMERICANS WERE ENEMIES OF ENGLAND THEREFORE THE POMPOUS DON TREATED THEM ROYALLY
IT WAS A NEW RIVER WITH WONDERFUL PURPLE WATER THE PURPLE OF RIVER SILT BLENDING WITH OCEAN BLUE THE BANKS WERE WOODED TO THE VERY WATER'S EDGE WITH HUGE GIRTHED AND MOSSED TREES
APPEARING AT FIRST TO BAR THE PASSAGE AHEAD THIS WAS BAR ROCK BEYOND IT SEVERAL MINOR RAPIDS WERE PASSED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THEN THEY CAME UPON A SERIES OF GREAT WHIRLPOOLS WHICH SEEMED IMPASSABLE
THE ADVANCE WAS BY A SUCCESSION OF RAPIDS AND PORTAGES
THE COLUMBIA HAD BEEN BEACHED AND DISMANTLED LOOP HOLES PUNCTURED THE PALISADES OF THE FORT AND CANNON WERE ABOVE THE GATES SENTINELS KEPT CONSTANT GUARD
AND COME OUT ON THE PACIFIC AGAIN VANCOUVER NOW HEADED HIS SHIPS INLAND AND PROCEEDED TO EXPLORE PUGET SOUND NEVER BEFORE HAD WHITE MEN'S BOATS CRUISED THE WATERS OF THAT SPIDER SHAPED SEA
UNDERTAKING' RAN THEM DOWN THE RAPIDS WITH LIGHT BALLAST THEY THEN CAME BACK OVERLAND FOR THE PACKS THIS TASK SAYS FRASER WAS AS DANGEROUS AS GOING BY WATER
WHEREVER THE WILD CURRENT DROVE THE DUG OUT INSHORE AND TOSSED BY THE WAVES A CHIP LIKE CRAFT CONTAINING NINETEEN RAGGED MEN SINGING LIKE SCHOOLBOYS ONCE AWAY FROM THE COASTAL TRIBES HOWEVER
TOWARDS THE END OF JULY THE CARRIERS CAMPED ON STUART LAKE WERE AMAZED TO SEE ADVANCING ACROSS THE WATERS WITH RHYTHMIC GALLOP OF PADDLES TWO ENORMOUS BIRCH CANOES
THERE WERE PLACES WHERE FRASER'S VOYAGEURS HAD TO CLIMB PRECIPICES BY MEANS OF FRAIL LADDERS
BUT THE MEN UNLOADED THE CANOES AND
FOLLOWED EACH OTHER IN AWFUL SILENCE AND WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE END WE STOOD GAZING AT EACH OTHER IN SILENT CONGRATULATION ON OUR NARROW ESCAPE FROM TOTAL DESTRUCTION AFTER BREATHING A LITTLE WE CONTINUED OUR COURSE TO THE POINT
HAD CEDED LOUISIANA TO FRANCE AND FRANCE BY WAY OF CHECKMATING BRITISH ADVANCE IN NORTH AMERICA HAD SOLD LOUISIANA TO THE UNITED STATES FOR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS
VANCOUVER HELD THAT SPAIN MUST RELINQUISH THE SITE OF MEARES'S FORT AND THE TERRITORY SURROUNDING IT AND PORT COX
NO WONDER THE TWO SCOTSMEN NAMED THE NEW INLAND EMPIRE NEW CALEDONIA AFTER THEIR NATIVE LAND IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT M'DOUGALL HAD HEARD OF ANOTHER MOUNTAIN TARN THIS WAS FORTY MILES SOUTH OF STUART LAKE
THAN HISTORY HAS YET ACCORDED THEM ENGLAND IT MAY BE BELIEVED DID NOT CALMLY SUBMIT TO SEEING THE SHIPS AND FORTS OF HER TRADERS SEIZED AT NOOTKA IT WAS NOT THAT ENGLAND CARED FOR THE VALUE OF THREE VESSELS ENGAGED IN FOREIGN TRADE
HOWEVER IT BEING ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY CANOES BY LAND ALL HANDS WITHOUT HESITATION EMBARKED ON THE MERCY OF THE AWFUL TIDE ONCE ON THE WATER THE DIE WAS CAST
HAD FOUND WHAT ARE NOW KNOWN AS BURRARD INLET VANCOUVER CITY POINT GREY SHAUGHNESSY HEIGHTS AND THE FRASER RIVER THE CREW WERE PRESENTLY ALL ILL OF SCURVY POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF THE UNSANITARY
BETTER THEY ADVISED GO OVERLAND EASTWARD TO A GREAT PEACEFUL RIVER AND DESCEND THAT TO THE SEA FRASER OF COURSE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE PEACEFUL RIVER THEY SPOKE OF WAS REALLY THE COLUMBIA HE THOUGHT THE RIVER HE WAS FOLLOWING
AT THE HEADWATERS OF THE NECHACO THE NORTH FORK OF THE FRASER STUART WENT OVERLAND SOUTH TO SPY OUT THE SOUTHERN LAKE AND HIS REPORT WAS OF SUCH AN ENTRANCING REGION HEAVILY FORESTED WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF GAME AND FISH
THIS RIVER IS THEREFORE NOT THE COLUMBIA HE DECLARED IF I HAD BEEN CONVINCED OF THIS WHEN I LEFT MY CANOES I WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE RETURNED THE RETURN JOURNEY WAS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER ALWAYS ONE MAN STOOD GUARD
I DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR THAT I WILL SOONER PERISH THAN FORSAKE IN DISTRESS ANY OF OUR CREW DURING THE PRESENT VOYAGE WITH RENEWED SELF RESPECT THEY THEN PADDLED OFF SINGING VOYAGEURS SONGS TO KEEP UP THEIR COURAGE
WHEN BERING SET OUT HE HAD THE POWER OF THE WHOLE RUSSIAN EMPIRE BEHIND HIM
AMID MUCH FIRING OF MUSKETS AND DRINKING OF WINE QUIMPER TOOK SOLEMN POSSESSION OF ALL THIS TERRITORY FOR SPAIN
TO FIT OUT AN EXPEDITION DOWN THE GREAT RIVER WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS THE COLUMBIA AND IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN O SEVEN TWO CANOES UNDER JULES QUESNEL WERE SENT OUT WITH GOODS
