HER EYES DIRECTED TOW'RDS ME WITH THAT LOOK A MOTHER CASTS ON A DELIRIOUS CHILD AND SHE BEGAN ALL THINGS WHATE'ER THEY BE HAVE ORDER AMONG THEMSELVES AND THIS IS FORM
TOWARDS ME TURNING BLITHE AS BEAUTIFUL SAID UNTO ME FIX GRATEFULLY THY MIND ON GOD WHO UNTO THE FIRST STAR HAS BROUGHT US
THIS OTHER SPLENDOUR WHICH TO THEE REVEALS ITSELF ON MY RIGHT SIDE AND IS ENKINDLED WITH ALL THE ILLUMINATION OF OUR SPHERE WHAT OF MYSELF I SAY APPLIES TO HER
PERADVENTURE IN LOSING ME YOU MIGHT YOURSELVES BE LOST THE SEA I SAIL HAS NEVER YET BEEN PASSED MINERVA BREATHES AND PILOTS ME APOLLO AND MUSES NINE
AT HIS ARBITRAMENT WITHOUT THE TURNING BOTH OF THE WHITE AND OF THE YELLOW KEY AND EVERY PERMUTATION DEEM AS FOOLISH IF IN THE SUBSTITUTE THE THING RELINQUISHED AS THE FOUR IS IN SIX BE NOT CONTAINED
CONTINUED THUS HER HOLY ARGUMENT THE GREATEST GIFT THAT IN HIS LARGESS GOD CREATING MADE AND UNTO HIS OWN GOODNESS NEAREST CONFORMED AND THAT WHICH HE DOTH PRIZE MOST HIGHLY IS THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL
SO THAT FORTH IT DOES NOT BREATHE THOU ARGUEST IF GOOD WILL BE PERMANENT THE VIOLENCE OF OTHERS FOR WHAT REASON DOTH IT DECREASE THE MEASURE OF MY MERIT AGAIN FOR DOUBTING
A SACRIFICE IS OF THIS TREASURE MADE SUCH AS I SAY AND MADE BY ITS OWN ACT WHAT CAN BE RENDERED THEN AS COMPENSATION THINK'ST THOU TO MAKE GOOD USE OF WHAT THOU'ST OFFERED
FOR IT IS NEAR THE PRIMAL TRUTH AND THEN THOU FROM PICCARDA MIGHT'ST HAVE HEARD COSTANZA KEPT AFFECTION FOR THE VEIL SO THAT SHE SEEMETH HERE TO CONTRADICT ME MANY TIMES BROTHER HAS IT COME TO PASS THAT TO ESCAPE FROM PERIL
THE HAVING HEARD WITHOUT RETAINING IT IN THE ESSENCE OF THIS SACRIFICE TWO THINGS CONVENE TOGETHER AND THE ONE IS THAT OF WHICH TIS MADE THE OTHER IS THE AGREEMENT THIS LAST FOR EVERMORE IS CANCELLED NOT
WHATEVER OF THE HOLY REALM I HAD THE POWER TO TREASURE IN MY MIND SHALL NOW BECOME THE SUBJECT OF MY SONG O GOOD APOLLO FOR THIS LAST EMPRISE MAKE OF ME SUCH A VESSEL OF THY POWER
AS ONE WHOM TOO GREAT EAGERNESS BEWILDERS O WELL CREATED SPIRIT WHO IN THE RAYS OF LIFE ETERNAL DOST THE SWEETNESS TASTE WHICH BEING UNTASTED NE'ER IS COMPREHENDED
SUFFICE HIM FOR WHOM GRACE THE EXPERIENCE RESERVES IF I WAS MERELY WHAT OF ME THOU NEWLY CREATEDST LOVE WHO GOVERNEST THE HEAVEN THOU KNOWEST WHO DIDST LIFT ME WITH THY LIGHT
OR EVER YET THE WARFARE BE ABANDONED WITH LIGHT THAT THROUGH THE WHOLE OF HEAVEN IS SPREAD KINDLED ARE WE AND HENCE IF THOU DESIREST TO KNOW OF US AT THINE OWN PLEASURE SATE THEE
SILENCE IMPOSED UPON MY EAGER MIND THAT HAD ALREADY IN ADVANCE NEW QUESTIONS AND AS AN ARROW THAT UPON THE MARK STRIKES ERE THE BOWSTRING QUIET HATH BECOME SO DID WE SPEED INTO THE SECOND REALM
FROM THE INTELLIGENCE PROFOUND WHICH TURNS IT THE IMAGE TAKES AND MAKES OF IT A SEAL AND EVEN AS THE SOUL WITHIN YOUR DUST THROUGH MEMBERS DIFFERENT AND ACCOMMODATED TO FACULTIES DIVERSE EXPANDS ITSELF
BE FAITHFUL AND NOT BLIND IN DOING THAT AS JEPHTHAH WAS IN HIS FIRST OFFERING WHOM MORE BESEEMED TO SAY I HAVE DONE WRONG THAN TO DO WORSE BY KEEPING
BROUGHT FORTH THE THIRD AND LATEST PUISSANCE THUS UNTO ME SHE SPAKE AND THEN BEGAN AVE MARIA SINGING AND IN SINGING VANISHED AS THROUGH DEEP WATER SOMETHING HEAVY
I SAW TURNED ROUND AND GAZING AT THE SUN NEVER DID EAGLE FASTEN SO UPON IT AND EVEN AS A SECOND RAY IS WONT TO ISSUE FROM THE FIRST AND REASCEND LIKE TO A PILGRIM WHO WOULD FAIN RETURN
AND AS FOOLISH THOU THE GREAT LEADER OF THE GREEKS WILT FIND WHENCE WEPT IPHIGENIA HER FAIR FACE AND MADE FOR HER BOTH WISE AND SIMPLE WEEP
THAT A PEARL ON FOREHEAD WHITE COMES NOT LESS SPEEDILY UNTO OUR EYES SUCH SAW I MANY FACES PROMPT TO SPEAK SO THAT I RAN IN ERROR OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH KINDLED LOVE TWIXT MAN AND FOUNTAIN
FROM THIS PROCEEDS WHATE'ER FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT APPEARETH DIFFERENT NOT FROM DENSE AND RARE THIS IS THE FORMAL PRINCIPLE THAT PRODUCES ACCORDING TO ITS GOODNESS DARK AND BRIGHT
THUS OF HER ACTION THROUGH THE EYES INFUSED IN MY IMAGINATION MINE I MADE AND SUNWARD FIXED MINE EYES BEYOND OUR WONT
AND NOT OF SIN HERETICAL BUT STILL THAT YOUR PERCEPTION MAY BE ABLE TO THOROUGHLY PENETRATE THIS VERITY AS THOU DESIREST I WILL SATISFY THEE
NOR OF EXISTENCE MORE OR FEWER YEARS BUT ALL MAKE BEAUTIFUL THE PRIMAL CIRCLE AND HAVE SWEET LIFE IN DIFFERENT DEGREES BY FEELING MORE OR LESS THE ETERNAL BREATH THEY SHOWED THEMSELVES HERE
BUT NOW ANOTHER PASSAGE RUNS ACROSS BEFORE THINE EYES AND SUCH THAT BY THYSELF THOU COULDST NOT THREAD IT ERE THOU WOULDST BE WEARY I HAVE FOR CERTAIN PUT INTO THY MIND THAT SOUL BEATIFIED COULD NEVER LIE
INTO ITSELF DID THE ETERNAL PEARL RECEIVE US EVEN AS WATER DOTH RECEIVE A RAY OF LIGHT REMAINING STILL UNBROKEN IF I WAS BODY
WHICH DOTH TRANSFORM YOU FROM OUR FIRST CONCEPTIONS THEREFORE I WAS NOT SWIFT IN MY REMEMBRANCE BUT WHAT THOU TELLEST ME NOW AIDS ME SO THAT THE REFIGURING IS EASIER TO ME BUT TELL ME
TO ALL THE REALM TIS PLEASING AS TO THE KING WHO MAKES HIS WILL OUR WILL AND HIS WILL IS OUR PEACE THIS IS THE SEA TO WHICH IS MOVING ONWARD WHATSOEVER IT DOTH CREATE
BEATRICE GAZED UPON ME WITH HER EYES FULL OF THE SPARKS OF LOVE AND SO DIVINE THAT OVERCOME MY POWER I TURNED MY BACK AND ALMOST LOST MYSELF WITH EYES DOWNCAST PARADISO
SINCE FROM ABOVE THEY TAKE AND ACT BENEATH OBSERVE ME WELL HOW THROUGH THIS PLACE I COME UNTO THE TRUTH THOU WISHEST THAT HEREAFTER THOU MAYST ALONE KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE FORD
AND PLEDGED ME TO THE PATHWAY OF HER SECT THEN MEN ACCUSTOMED UNTO EVIL MORE THAN UNTO GOOD FROM THE SWEET CLOISTER TORE ME GOD KNOWS WHAT AFTERWARD MY LIFE BECAME
O'ER THE GREAT SEA OF BEING AND EACH ONE WITH INSTINCT GIVEN IT WHICH BEARS IT ON THIS BEARS AWAY THE FIRE TOWARDS THE MOON THIS IS IN MORTAL HEARTS THE MOTIVE POWER THIS BINDS TOGETHER
GRATEFUL TWILL BE TO ME IF THOU CONTENT ME BOTH WITH THY NAME
WHICH IS KNOWN TO THEE AS MATTER MAY WELL INDEED BE SUCH THAT ONE ERRS NOT
WITH GAINS ILL GOTTEN THOU WOULDST DO GOOD DEED NOW ART THOU CERTAIN OF THE GREATER POINT BUT BECAUSE HOLY CHURCH IN THIS DISPENSES WHICH SEEMS AGAINST THE TRUTH WHICH I HAVE SHOWN THEE
ANOTHER TRUTH WHICH IS OBSCURE TO ME I WISH TO KNOW IF MAN CAN SATISFY YOU FOR BROKEN VOWS WITH OTHER GOOD DEEDS SO THAT IN YOUR BALANCE THEY WILL NOT BE LIGHT
THAT FORCE WITH WILL COMMINGLES AND THEY CAUSE THAT THE OFFENCES CANNOT BE EXCUSED WILL ABSOLUTE CONSENTETH NOT TO EVIL BUT IN SO FAR CONSENTETH AS IT FEARS IF IT REFRAIN
BUT BY THAT ONE WHICH CIRCLES FOUR UNITETH WITH THREE CROSSES WITH BETTER COURSE AND WITH A BETTER STAR CONJOINED IT ISSUES AND THE MUNDANE WAX TEMPERS AND STAMPS MORE AFTER ITS OWN FASHION
DOUBT AT THE FOOT OF TRUTH AND THIS IS NATURE WHICH TO THE TOP FROM HEIGHT TO HEIGHT IMPELS US THIS DOTH INVITE ME
E'ER MADE A LAKE SO WIDELY SPREAD ABROAD THE NEWNESS OF THE SOUND AND THE GREAT LIGHT KINDLED IN ME A LONGING FOR THEIR CAUSE NEVER BEFORE WITH SUCH ACUTENESS FELT WHENCE SHE
I CAN MAKE MANIFEST THOU'LT SEE ME COME UNTO THY DARLING TREE AND CROWN MYSELF THEREAFTER WITH THOSE LEAVES OF WHICH THE THEME AND THOU SHALL MAKE ME WORTHY SO SELDOM FATHER DO WE GATHER THEM
BY PROVING AND REPROVING THE SWEET ASPECT AND THAT I MIGHT CONFESS MYSELF CONVINCED AND CONFIDENT SO FAR AS WAS BEFITTING I LIFTED MORE ERECT MY HEAD TO SPEAK BUT THERE APPEARED A VISION
THEREAFTER ANSWERED ME SO FULL OF GLADNESS SHE SEEMED TO BURN IN THE FIRST FIRE OF LOVE BROTHER OUR WILL IS QUIETED BY VIRTUE OF CHARITY
THOU'LT SEE HOW I FROM THESE WAS IN DESIRE OF HEARING THEIR CONDITIONS AS THEY UNTO MINE EYES WERE MANIFEST O THOU WELL BORN UNTO WHOM GRACE CONCEDES TO SEE THE THRONES OF THE ETERNAL TRIUMPH
NE'ER RAN AS THOU WHO THITHERWARD RETURNEST IF OF MY FORMER DOUBT I WAS DIVESTED BY THESE BRIEF LITTLE WORDS MORE SMILED THAN SPOKEN I IN A NEW ONE WAS THE MORE ENSNARED AND SAID
AND IF IT CHANCE THE OTHER I DEMOLISH THEN FALSIFIED WILL THY OPINION BE BUT IF THIS RARITY GO NOT THROUGH AND THROUGH THERE NEEDS MUST BE A LIMIT
PARADISO CANTO THREE THAT SUN WHICH ERST WITH LOVE MY BOSOM WARMED OF BEAUTEOUS TRUTH HAD UNTO ME DISCOVERED
YE WHO IN THIS PLACE ARE HAPPY ARE YOU DESIROUS OF A HIGHER PLACE TO SEE MORE OR TO MAKE YOURSELVES MORE FRIENDS FIRST WITH THOSE OTHER SHADES SHE SMILED A LITTLE
HENCE IF I HELD MY PEACE MYSELF I BLAME NOT
WHICH AS IT APPREHENDS TO THE GOOD APPREHENDED MOVES ITS FEET WELL I PERCEIVE HOW IS ALREADY SHINING INTO THINE INTELLECT THE ETERNAL LIGHT THAT ONLY SEEN ENKINDLES ALWAYS LOVE
TO LEARN FROM HER WHAT WAS THE WEB WHEREIN SHE DID NOT PLY THE SHUTTLE TO THE END A PERFECT LIFE AND MERIT HIGH IN HEAVEN A LADY O'ER US SAID SHE BY WHOSE RULE DOWN IN YOUR WORLD THEY VEST AND VEIL THEMSELVES
THEREFORE IS GIVEN US BECAUSE OUR VOWS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED AND IN SOME PART VOID WHENCE I TO HER IN YOUR MIRACULOUS ASPECTS THERE SHINES I KNOW NOT WHAT OF THE DIVINE
HE OF THE SERAPHIM MOST ABSORBED IN GOD MOSES AND SAMUEL AND WHICHEVER JOHN THOU MAYST SELECT I SAY AND EVEN MARY HAVE NOT IN ANY OTHER HEAVEN THEIR SEATS THAN HAVE THOSE SPIRITS THAT JUST APPEARED TO THEE
WHO UNTO COLCHOS PASSED WERE NOT SO WONDER STRUCK AS YOU SHALL BE WHEN JASON THEY BEHELD A PLOUGHMAN MADE THE CON CREATED AND PERPETUAL THIRST FOR THE REALM DEIFORM DID BEAR US ON AS SWIFT
ALL OUR AFFECTIONS THAT ALONE INFLAMED ARE IN THE PLEASURE OF THE HOLY GHOST REJOICE AT BEING OF HIS ORDER FORMED AND THIS ALLOTMENT WHICH APPEARS SO LOW
MADONNA AS DEVOUTLY AS MOST I CAN DO I GIVE THANKS TO HIM WHO HAS REMOVED ME FROM THE MORTAL WORLD BUT TELL ME WHAT THE DUSKY SPOTS MAY BE UPON THIS BODY WHICH BELOW ON EARTH
THERE SHALT THOU SEE HOW IT PERFORCE IS EQUALLY RESPLENDENT NOW
ON THIS ACCOUNT
O DIVINE SAID I FORTHWITH WHOSE SPEECH INUNDATES ME AND WARMS ME SO IT MORE AND MORE REVIVES ME MY OWN AFFECTION IS NOT SO PROFOUND AS TO SUFFICE IN RENDERING GRACE FOR GRACE
THERE MUCH IS LAWFUL WHICH IS HERE UNLAWFUL UNTO OUR POWERS BY VIRTUE OF THE PLACE MADE FOR THE HUMAN SPECIES AS ITS OWN NOT LONG I BORE IT NOR SO LITTLE WHILE BUT
WHERE'ER THE KEY OF SENSE DOTH NOT UNLOCK
SO LIKEWISE THIS INTELLIGENCE DIFFUSES ITS VIRTUE MULTIPLIED AMONG THE STARS ITSELF REVOLVING ON ITS UNITY VIRTUE DIVERSE DOTH A DIVERSE ALLOYAGE MAKE
WHICH IS WONT TO BE THE FOUNTAIN TO THE RIVERS OF YOUR ARTS THREE MIRRORS SHALT THOU TAKE AND TWO REMOVE ALIKE FROM THEE THE OTHER MORE REMOTE BETWEEN THE FORMER TWO SHALL MEET THINE EYES
MAKES WITH ITS LIGHT THE HEAVEN FOREVER QUIET WHEREIN THAT TURNS WHICH HAS THE GREATEST HASTE AND THITHER NOW AS TO A SITE DECREED BEARS US AWAY THE VIRTUE OF THAT CORD
WITH RELUCTANCE THAT HAS BEEN DONE IT WAS NOT RIGHT TO DO E'EN AS ALCMAEON
WITH FALSE IMAGINING THAT THOU SEEST NOT WHAT THOU WOULDST SEE IF THOU HADST SHAKEN IT OFF THOU ART NOT UPON EARTH AS THOU BELIEVEST BUT LIGHTNING FLEEING ITS APPROPRIATE SITE
INTO THE LIGHT OF MY SWEET GUIDE WHO SMILING KINDLED IN HER HOLY EYES MARVEL THOU NOT SHE SAID TO ME BECAUSE I SMILE AT THIS THY PUERILE CONCEIT
AND ALL THAT NATURE MAKES THEN IT WAS CLEAR TO ME HOW EVERYWHERE IN HEAVEN IS PARADISE ALTHOUGH THE GRACE OF GOOD SUPREME THERE RAIN NOT IN ONE MEASURE BUT AS IT COMES TO PASS
AND IF SOME OTHER THING YOUR LOVE SEDUCE TIS NOTHING BUT A VESTIGE OF THE SAME ILL UNDERSTOOD WHICH THERE IS SHINING THROUGH THOU FAIN WOULDST KNOW
WITH THE PRECIOUS BODY THAT IT QUICKENS IN WHICH AS LIFE IN YOU IT IS COMBINED FROM THE GLAD NATURE WHENCE IT IS DERIVED THE MINGLED VIRTUE THROUGH THE BODY SHINES EVEN AS GLADNESS THROUGH THE LIVING PUPIL
WHO IN SOME PRETTY LITTLE BOAT EAGER TO LISTEN HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING BEHIND MY SHIP THAT SINGING SAILS ALONG TURN BACK TO LOOK AGAIN UPON YOUR SHORES DO NOT PUT OUT TO SEA LEST
OF THE HEART'S VEIL SHE NEVER WAS DIVESTED OF GREAT COSTANZA THIS IS THE EFFULGENCE
BECAUSE THEY CORUSCATE WHEN THOU DOST SMILE BUT KNOW NOT WHO THOU ART NOR WHY THOU HAST SPIRIT AUGUST THY STATION IN THE SPHERE THAT VEILS ITSELF TO MEN IN ALIEN RAYS
LISTEN AND BELIEVE FOR THE TRUE LIGHT WHICH GIVETH PEACE TO THEM PERMITS THEM NOT TO TURN FROM IT THEIR FEET AND I UNTO THE SHADE THAT SEEMED MOST WISHFUL TO SPEAK DIRECTED ME AND I BEGAN
MAKE PEOPLE TELL THAT FABULOUS TALE OF CAIN SOMEWHAT SHE SMILED AND THEN IF THE OPINION OF MORTALS BE ERRONEOUS SHE SAID
IS FOLLOWED BY GREAT FLAME PERCHANCE WITH BETTER VOICES AFTER ME SHALL PRAYER BE MADE THAT CYRRHA MAY RESPOND TO MORTAL MEN BY PASSAGES DIVERSE UPRISES THE WORLD'S LAMP
SINCE IT MUST BE SO NOR DO I COMMEND I HELD MY PEACE BUT MY DESIRE WAS PAINTED UPON MY FACE AND QUESTIONING WITH THAT MORE FERVENT FAR THAN BY ARTICULATE SPEECH
FURNISH THEE OCCASION SOULS SEEMING TO RETURN UNTO THE STARS ACCORDING TO THE SENTIMENT OF PLATO THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WHICH UPON THY WISH ARE THRUSTING EQUALLY AND THEREFORE FIRST WILL I TREAT THAT WHICH HATH THE MOST OF GALL
IF THEIR WILL HAD BEEN PERFECT LIKE TO THAT WHICH LAWRENCE FAST UPON HIS GRIDIRON HELD AND MUTIUS MADE SEVERE TO HIS OWN HAND IT WOULD HAVE URGED THEM BACK ALONG THE ROAD WHENCE THEY WERE DRAGGED AS SOON AS THEY WERE FREE
IF ONE FOOD SATES AND FOR ANOTHER STILL REMAINS THE LONGING WE ASK FOR THIS AND THAT DECLINE WITH THANKS E'EN THUS DID I WITH GESTURE AND WITH WORD
NOT BECAUSE ALLOTTED THIS SPHERE HAS BEEN TO THEM BUT TO GIVE SIGN OF THE CELESTIAL WHICH IS LEAST EXALTED
IN THE ORDER THAT I SPEAK OF ARE INCLINED ALL NATURES BY THEIR DESTINIES DIVERSE MORE OR LESS NEAR UNTO THEIR ORIGIN HENCE THEY MOVE ONWARD UNTO PORTS DIVERSE
NAY TIS ESSENTIAL TO THIS BLEST EXISTENCE TO KEEP ITSELF WITHIN THE WILL DIVINE WHEREBY OUR VERY WISHES ARE MADE ONE SO THAT AS WE ARE STATION ABOVE STATION THROUGHOUT THIS REALM
AND FEET AND HANDS TO GOD ATTRIBUTES AND MEANS SOMETHING ELSE AND HOLY CHURCH UNDER AN ASPECT HUMAN GABRIEL AND MICHAEL REPRESENT TO YOU AND HIM WHO MADE TOBIAS WHOLE AGAIN THAT WHICH TIMAEUS ARGUES OF THE SOUL
BE YE MORE SERIOUS IN YOUR MOVEMENTS BE YE NOT LIKE A FEATHER AT EACH WIND AND THINK NOT EVERY WATER WASHES YOU YE HAVE THE OLD AND THE NEW TESTAMENT AND THE PASTOR OF THE CHURCH WHO GUIDETH YOU LET THIS SUFFICE YOU UNTO YOUR SALVATION
WHAT BECAME I WHO BY MY NATURE AM EXCEEDING MUTABLE IN EVERY GUISE AS IN A FISH POND WHICH IS PURE AND TRANQUIL THE FISHES DRAW TO THAT WHICH FROM WITHOUT COMES IN SUCH FASHION THAT THEIR FOOD THEY DEEM IT
DOTH DEVIATE SOMETIMES THE CREATURE WHO THE POWER POSSESSES THOUGH THUS IMPELLED TO SWERVE SOME OTHER WAY IN THE SAME WISE AS ONE MAY SEE THE FIRE FALL FROM A CLOUD
MY LADY THERE SO JOYFUL I BEHELD AS INTO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THAT HEAVEN SHE ENTERED MORE LUMINOUS THEREAT THE PLANET GREW AND IF THE STAR ITSELF WAS CHANGED AND SMILED
MY SIGHT THAT FOLLOWED HER
AND TEMPTING A FREE MAN WOULD DIE OF HUNGER ERE EITHER HE COULD BRING UNTO HIS TEETH SO WOULD A LAMB BETWEEN THE RAVENINGS OF TWO FIERCE WOLVES STAND FEARING BOTH ALIKE
TURNED TOWARDS THESE CAUSE THAT BEHIND THY BACK BE PLACED A LIGHT ILLUMING THE THREE MIRRORS AND COMING BACK TO THEE BY ALL REFLECTED THOUGH IN ITS QUANTITY BE NOT SO AMPLE THE IMAGE MOST REMOTE
AND IT CAN ATTAIN IT IF NOT THEN EACH DESIRE WOULD FRUSTRATE BE
BECAUSE THE SOLID FOOD WHICH THOU HAST TAKEN REQUIRETH FURTHER AID FOR THY DIGESTION OPEN THY MIND TO THAT WHICH I REVEAL AND FIX IT THERE WITHIN FOR TIS NOT KNOWLEDGE
PERHAPS HIS BOW DOTH HIT UPON SOME TRUTH
AND IN SUCH SPACE PERCHANCE AS STRIKES A BOLT AND FLIES AND FROM THE NOTCH UNLOCKS ITSELF
THEREFORE WHATEVER THING HAS SO GREAT WEIGHT IN VALUE THAT IT DRAGS DOWN EVERY BALANCE CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH OTHER SPENDING LET MORTALS NEVER TAKE A VOW IN JEST
THAT UNTIL DEATH THEY MAY BOTH WATCH AND SLEEP BESIDE THAT SPOUSE WHO EVERY VOW ACCEPTS WHICH CHARITY CONFORMETH TO HIS PLEASURE
THE OTHER DOUBT WHICH DOTH DISQUIET THEE LESS VENOM HAS FOR ITS MALEVOLENCE COULD NEVER LEAD THEE OTHERWHERE FROM ME THAT AS UNJUST OUR JUSTICE SHOULD APPEAR IN EYES OF MORTALS IS AN ARGUMENT OF FAITH
THEE THUS REMAINING IN THY INTELLECT WILL I INFORM WITH SUCH A LIVING LIGHT THAT IT SHALL TREMBLE IN ITS ASPECT TO THEE WITHIN THE HEAVEN OF THE DIVINE REPOSE REVOLVES A BODY
WHEREAT SHE PROMPTLY AND WITH LAUGHING EYES OUR CHARITY DOTH NEVER SHUT THE DOORS AGAINST A JUST DESIRE EXCEPT AS ONE WHO WILLS THAT ALL HER COURT BE LIKE HERSELF
THAT MY CONFESSION I REMEMBERED NOT SUCH AS THROUGH POLISHED AND TRANSPARENT GLASS OR WATERS CRYSTALLINE AND UNDISTURBED BUT NOT SO DEEP AS THAT THEIR BED BE LOST COME BACK AGAIN THE OUTLINES OF OUR FACES SO FEEBLE
FOR TRIUMPH OR OF CAESAR OR OF POET THE FAULT AND SHAME OF HUMAN INCLINATIONS THAT THE PENEIAN FOLIAGE SHOULD BRING FORTH JOY TO THE JOYOUS DELPHIC DEITY
IT SEEMED TO ME A CLOUD ENCOMPASSED US LUMINOUS DENSE CONSOLIDATE AND BRIGHT AS ADAMANT ON WHICH THE SUN IS STRIKING
TASTING OF THE HERB THAT MADE HIM PEER OF THE OTHER GODS BENEATH THE SEA TO REPRESENT TRANSHUMANISE IN WORDS IMPOSSIBLE WERE THE EXAMPLE THEN
I BEHELD IT SPARKLE ROUND ABOUT LIKE IRON THAT COMES MOLTEN FROM THE FIRE AND SUDDENLY IT SEEMED THAT DAY TO DAY WAS ADDED AS IF HE WHO HAS THE POWER HAD WITH ANOTHER SUN THE HEAVEN ADORNED
IF WITH ANOTHER SERVICE FOR BROKEN VOW CAN SUCH RETURN BE MADE AS TO SECURE THE SOUL FROM FURTHER CLAIM THIS CANTO THUS DID BEATRICE BEGIN AND AS A MAN WHO BREAKS NOT OFF HIS SPEECH
THE OTHER SPHERES BY VARIOUS DIFFERENCES ALL THE DISTINCTIONS WHICH THEY HAVE WITHIN THEM DISPOSE UNTO THEIR ENDS AND THEIR EFFECTS THUS DO THESE ORGANS OF THE WORLD PROCEED AS THOU PERCEIVEST NOW FROM GRADE TO GRADE
SUCH WAS THE FLOWING OF THE HOLY RIVER THAT ISSUED FROM THE FOUNT WHENCE SPRINGS ALL TRUTH THIS PUT TO REST MY WISHES ONE AND ALL O LOVE OF THE FIRST LOVER
FORASMUCH AS FOLLOWING THE SENSES THOU SEEST THAT THE REASON HAS SHORT WINGS BUT TELL ME WHAT THOU THINK'ST OF IT THYSELF AND I
BUT SUCH A SOLID WILL IS ALL TOO RARE AND BY THESE WORDS IF THOU HAST GATHERED THEM AS THOU SHOULDST DO THE ARGUMENT IS REFUTED THAT WOULD HAVE STILL ANNOYED THEE MANY TIMES
BEYOND WHICH ITS CONTRARY PREVENTS THE FURTHER PASSING AND THENCE THE FOREIGN RADIANCE IS REFLECTED EVEN AS A COLOUR COMETH BACK FROM GLASS THE WHICH BEHIND ITSELF CONCEALETH LEAD
SINCE ON THE TRUTH IT TRUSTS NOT YET ITS FOOT BUT TURNS THEE AS TIS WONT ON EMPTINESS TRUE SUBSTANCES ARE THESE WHICH THOU BEHOLDEST HERE RELEGATE FOR BREAKING OF SOME VOW THEREFORE SPEAK WITH THEM
WHO SAW ME AS I SAW MYSELF TO QUIET IN ME MY PERTURBED MIND OPENED HER MOUTH ERE I DID MINE TO ASK AND SHE BEGAN THOU MAKEST THYSELF SO DULL
FULL OF BEATITUDE THE SHADE WAS SEEN BY THE EFFULGENCE CLEAR THAT ISSUED FROM IT THINK READER IF WHAT HERE IS JUST BEGINNING NO FARTHER SHOULD PROCEED
YOU SEE I SPENT A GOOD DEAL IN SMITHTOWN YESTERDAY
BOBBY HANDED HIM A BANKNOTE HE DIDN'T MISS GRAHAM'S MEANING GLANCE
HE EMERGED FROM THE FOREST AND SAW AGAIN THE LEISURELY WEAVING OF THE SMOKE SHROUD ABOVE THE HOUSE THEN HIS EYES WERE DRAWN BY THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF A PAIR OF HORSES
THE MANAGER TOOK MY ADVICE BUT MARIA'S STILL MISSING
GRAHAM INTERRUPTED WITH A FLAT DEMAND FOR AN EXPLANATION HOW DID YOU GET AWAY
THE BIT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM HER MOUTH BUT THE BRIDLE HUNG INTACT ROUND HER NECK THE SADDLE HOWEVER LIKE ITS OWNER HAD DISAPPEARED FROM HER BACK THEN THE MEN BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH IN THE INTERIOR OF THE SWAMP THEY SOON CAME UPON THE SADDLE WHICH HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DELIBERATELY UNBUCKLED
MUSCULAR FILAMENTS OF THE FACIAL CAPILLARIES WHEREBY BEING DIVESTED OF THEIR ELASTICITY
HE WAS AROUSED BY THE TRAMPING OF MEN AROUND THE HOUSE AND STRANGE HARSH VOICES HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW AND GLANCED FROM THE WINDOW IT HAD LONG BEEN DAYLIGHT TWO BURLY FELLOWS IN OVERALLS CARRYING PICK AND SPADE ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
DEAD OR ALIVE OR WHICH SHOULD THROW ANY LIGHT UPON HIS FATE HAND BILLS PROCLAIMING THIS REWARD AND DESCRIBING THE MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE WERE EXHIBITED IN EVERY BAR ROOM AND OTHER CONSPICUOUS PLACE THROUGHOUT WESTCHESTER AND THE ADJACENT TOWNSHIPS
CAN BE FOUND ON THE OUTSIDE OF A SHORT RED STEER OR THE INSIDE OF A LONG BLACK BOTTLE BRASS BAND A CLEVER THOUGH SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED ARRANGEMENT FOR HOLDING A CROWD TOGETHER BRICK AN ADMIRABLE PERSON MADE OF THE RIGHT SORT OF CLAY AND POSSESSING PLENTY OF SAND
BY STANDER ONE WHO IS INJURED IN A STREET FIGHT
GAVE ME THE CREEPS TOO MAKES ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE HAS AN ABOMINABLY DEEP PURPOSE IN USING HIS WITS TO HANG ON HERE HE SUGGESTS RESOURCES AS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AS ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE OLD ROOM YOU'LL CONFESS BOBBY HE'S HAD A GOOD DEAL OF INFLUENCE OVER YOU AN INFLUENCE FOR EVIL
THEN THE PARTY PROCEEDED IN A BODY TO THE MISSING MAN'S HOUSE HERE ANOTHER SURPRISE AWAITED THEM THE COAT WAS AT ONCE RECOGNISED BY MISSUS SAVAREEN AS BELONGING TO HER HUSBAND BUT IT WAS NOT THE COAT WORN BY HIM AT THE TIME OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS THERE WAS NO DOUBT WHATEVER
MONEY BORN OF POOR BUT DISHONEST PARENTS
BUT THE HORSE WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER IT SEEMED IMPROBABLE THAT TWO LIVING SUBSTANCES OF SUCH BULK SHOULD PASS OUT OF BEING AND LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND THEM THEY MUST LITERALLY HAVE MELTED INTO THIN AIR NO THEY HADN'T AT LEAST THE BLACK MARE HADN'T
NOTHING FURTHER COULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF SEARCHING FOR THE LATTER PERSONAGE UNTIL DAYLIGHT IT WAS GETTING ON PRETTY WELL TOWARDS MORNING WHEN MISSUS SAVAREEN SOUGHT HER COUCH AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE HER SLUMBER WAS BROKEN AND DISTURBED SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK
SQUIRE HARRINGTON WENT DOWN TO TOWN AND MADE INQUIRIES AT THE BANK WHERE HE ASCERTAINED THAT THE STORY TOLD BY SAVAREEN TO OLD JONATHAN PERRY
BUT I WAS THERE AND YOU WEREN'T
HE WOULD HAVE GUARDED WITH A MORE PRECIOUS INTEREST THE DRAPINGS OF HIS FINAL SLEEP THIS NECESSARY TASK ON WHICH BOBBY HAD STUMBLED HAD MADE THE THICKET LESS CONGENIAL THAN THE HOUSE AS HE WALKED BACK HE FORECASTED WITH A KEEN APPREHENSION HIS APPROACHING ORDEAL
NO LIKELY PATH YET WHOSE CROSSING IS THE PRICE OF SALVATION HE WAS GLAD TO SEE GRAHAM LEAVE THE COURT AND HURRY TOWARD HIM I WAS COMING TO HUNT YOU UP BOBBY THE MINISTER'S ARRIVED SO HAS DOCTOR GROOM EVERYTHING'S ABOUT READY DOCTOR GROOM
HE STROLLED OVER AND HANDED BOBBY A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS WHERE'S ROBINSON BOBBY ASKED I SAW HIM IN THE COURT A WHILE AGO I DARESAY HE'S WANDERING AROUND PERHAPS WATCHING THE MEN AT THE GRAVE HE LEARNED NOTHING NEW LAST NIGHT I WAS WITH HIM AT BREAKFAST I GATHER NOT
BOWER A SHADY RETREAT IN GENERAL BOWERY A SHADY RETREAT IN NEW YORK BRACE SECURITY FOR THE TROUSERS BRACER SECURITY FOR THE STOMACH BRACELET SECURITY FOR THE PAWN BROKER BRAIN
FOR GROOM HAS BROUGHT THE GHOSTS BACK WITH HIM DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT YOU WANT THE TRUTH DON'T YOU YES BOBBY SAID EVEN IF IT DOES FOR ME
THERE WAS AN IRONICAL JUSTICE IN THE CONDITION OF THE OLD CEMETERY IT HAD RECEIVED NO INTERMENT SINCE THE DEATH OF KATHERINE'S FATHER LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CEDARS SILAS BLACKBURN HAD DELIVERED IT TO THE SWIFT OBLITERATING FINGERS OF TIME
AS IF FLEEING FROM AN IMMATERIAL THING SUDDENLY QUICKENED WITH THE POWER OF ACCUSATION HE COULD PICTURE THE FRESH OBLONG EXCAVATION IN THE SOIL OF THE FAMILY BURIAL GROUND
I MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT AS ALWAYS THOUGHT BROUGHT NO RELEASE IT MERELY INSISTED THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS PROVED AT LAST HE HAD BEEN SEEN SLIPPING UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM HIS ROOM AND AT THE SAME HOUR
MISSUS SAVAREEN SAT UP WAITING FOR HER LORD UNTIL LONG PAST MIDNIGHT BUT HER VIGIL WAS IN VAIN LAPIERRE AFTER CLOSING UP HIS INN FOR THE NIGHT DROPPED IN ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE TO SEE IF ANY NEWS OF THE ABSENTEE HAD ARRIVED
HIS SHARP EXCLAMATION RECALLED HOWELLS'S REPORT WHICH AT THEIR DIRECTION HE HAD FAILED TO MAIL HAD HIS EXCLAMATION BEEN DRAWN BY AN ACCUSER BOBBY STARTED TO RISE GRAHAM MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR THEN JENKINS ENTERED AND STOOD TO ONE SIDE
BOBBY WALKED FROM THE ROOM HE HADN'T CARED TO REPLY HE FEARED AS IT WAS THAT HE HAD LET SLIP HIS INCREASED SELF DOUBT HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND HAT AND LEFT THE HOUSE THE RAW COLD THE YEAR'S FIRST OMEN OF WINTER MADE HIS BLOOD RUN QUICKER
SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
BATHE AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST THEN WE CAN DECIDE THERE'S NO USE TALKING OF THE OTHER THING I'VE FORGOTTEN IT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE YOU MUST BOBBY SPRANG UPRIGHT HOW CAN I FORGET IT
FOR SHE WAS DISCOVERED BY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SEARCHING PARTY A LITTLE BEFORE NOON WHEN FOUND SHE WAS QUIETLY CROPPING THE DAMP HERBAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE CRANBERRY SWAMP AT THE REAR OF SQUIRE HARRINGTON'S FARM SHE WAS WHOLLY UNINJURED AND HAD EVIDENTLY SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
FROM THE CHEST OF DRAWERS TWO CANDLES THE ONLY LIGHT
AFTER THIS SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT PAREDES'S DETENTION HE HADN'T DREAMED THAT HIS WEARINESS COULD PLACATE EVEN MOMENTARILY SUCH REFLECTIONS BUT AT LAST HE SLEPT AGAIN
THAT MIGHT MAKE MEN WALK UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS BRAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY APPEARED AS MUCH AT SEA AS THE OTHERS
IN FACT HE HAD NOT WORN IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PREVIOUSLY HIS WIFE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING FOLDED AND LAID IT AWAY IN THE TOP OF A LARGE TRUNK ON THE SATURDAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST SINCE WHICH TIME SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON IT HERE WAS A DEEPENING OF THE MYSTERY
BIGAMY A FORM OF INSANITY IN WHICH A MAN INSISTS ON PAYING THREE BOARD BILLS INSTEAD OF TWO BILLIOUSNESS A LIVER COMPLAINT OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR PIETY BILL OF FARE A LIST OF EATABLES
BOHEMIA NOT ON THE MAP A LAND FLOWING WITH CANNED MILK AND DISTILLED HONEY AND UNTROUBLED BY CONSISTENCY CONVENTION CONSCIENCE OR CASH
A STRIP OF SAND SKIRTED BY WATER COVERED WITH LADY KILLERS IN SUMMER LIFE SAVERS IN WINTER
THE PANAMANIAN HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHING HE TOO WAS SOMBRELY DRESSED AND INSTEAD OF THE VIVID NECKTIE HE HAD WORN FROM THE COURTHOUSE A JET BLACK SCARF WAS PERFECTLY ARRANGED BENEATH HIS COLLAR HE LOUNGED OPPOSITE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
A DESIRABLE QUALITY IN THE FOURTH OF JULY ORATION BUT NOT IN THE FIREWORKS BROKE A WORD EXPRESSING THE ULTIMATE CONDITION OF ONE WHO IS TOO MUCH BENT ON SPECULATING BUM A FALLEN TOUGH BUMP A TOUGH FALL BUNCO
COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN FOR THE PRESENT IN THE MOURNFUL TRAGIC HOUSE THEREFORE HE WOULD CRUSH HIS JUSTIFIABLE ANGER
HIS RESERVE AND EASY DARING MASTERED THEM ALL AND ALWAYS AS NOW HE LAUGHED AT THE FUTILITY OF THEIR EFFORTS TO SOUND HIS PURPOSES TO LIMIT HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION BOBBY DIDN'T CARE TO MEET THE UNCOMMUNICATIVE EYES WHOSE DEPTHS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE
AS BELONG TO SAVAREEN IT WAS WET AND BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND IN FACT WAS LYING HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF A LITTLE PUDDLE OF WATER WHEN IT WAS FOUND THEN THE SEARCHERS MADE SURE OF FINDING THE BODY BUT IN THIS THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED
SIMPLE ENOUGH MISTER GRAHAM I TELEPHONED AS SOON AS RAWLINS GOT ME TO THE BASTILLE I COMMUNICATED WITH THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS THE COMPANY FOR WHICH I ONCE WORKED HE'S A PROMINENT AND BRILLIANT MAN HE PLANNED IT WITH SOME LOCAL FELLOW WHEN I WAS ARRAIGNED AT THE OPENING OF COURT THIS MORNING
BOBBY FORCED HIMSELF TO WALK UP THE STAIRCASE FACING THE FIRST PHASE OF HIS ORDEAL HE SAW THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY REALIZED THAT TOO FOR HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND FOLLOWED BY RAWLINS STARTED UPWARD THE ENTIRE COMPANY CROWDED THE STAIRS
IT WON'T LESSEN THE FACT OF HIS MURDER TIME GRAHAM SAID LESSENS SUCH FACTS EVEN FOR THE POLICE BOBBY GLANCED AT HIM FLUSHING YOU MEAN YOU'VE DECIDED TO STAND BY ME AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT GRAHAM SMILED
WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
A STRANGE MAN APPEARED WALKING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE HIS BLACK CLOTHING RELIEVED ONLY BY NARROW EDGES OF WHITE CUFFS BETWEEN THE SLEEVES AND THE HEAVY MOURNING GLOVES FITTED WITH SOLEMN HARMONY INTO THE LANDSCAPE AND BOBBY'S MOOD
IT'S NATURAL ENOUGH HE SHOULD BE HERE BOBBY AGREED INDIFFERENTLY THEY WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE GRAHAM MADE IT PLAIN THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR FROM THE SAD BUSINESS AHEAD
HAVE I ANY RIGHT DON'T GRAHAM SAID I'LL BE WITH YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT
AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
A GAME IN WHICH THE YOUNG MAN WHO BRAVELY STRIKES OUT FOR HIMSELF RECEIVES NO PRAISE FOR IT BAT SENIOR PARTNER OF BAT BALL AND CO AND NEVER FOUND WITHOUT THE REST OF THE FIRM AS IT TAKES SEVERAL HIGH BALLS TO MAKE ONE SHORT BAT BEACH
ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO LEARN HOW HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE APPARENT MIRACLES
FROM HIS THICKLY BEARDED FACE HIS REDDISH EYES GLEAMED FORTH WITH A FRESH INSTABILITY THE CLERGYMAN SHOOK HANDS WITH BOBBY WE NEED NOT DELAY YOUR COUSIN IS UPSTAIRS HE INCLUDED THE COMPANY IN HIS CIRCLING TURN OF THE HEAD ANY ONE WHO CARES TO GO
HE SPOKE WITH PRONOUNCED DELIBERATION STARTLING BOBBY
WONDERFUL PARENTS ARE YET TO BE HEARD FROM WHO DON'T THINK THEIRS IS A WONDER A NOCTURNAL ANIMAL TO WHICH EVERYONE IN A SLEEPING CAR IS EAGER TO GIVE A WIDE BERTH BACHELOR FROM LATIN BACULUS A STICK UNATTACHED
AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EVIDENCE BOBBY DEFENDED HIMSELF IF IT HAD BEEN STOLEN EARLIER THE COAT POCKET MIGHT HAVE RETAINED ITS BULGING SHAPE
I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF SINCE HE CAME BACK GRAHAM ANSWERED IF THERE'S ANY QUEER POWER BEHIND HIS QUIET MANNER MAYBE HE IS PSYCHIC MAYBE HE CAN DO THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'VE WONDERED IF HE HAD WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING IT
THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
BUT FOUND NOTHING FURTHER TO REWARD THEIR SEARCH THE GROUND WAS TOO SOFT AND MARSHY TO RETAIN ANY TRACES OF FOOTSTEPS AND THE MARE AND SADDLE FURNISHED THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT THE OBJECT OF THEIR QUEST HAD BEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SWAMP AND OF COURSE THIS EVIDENCE WAS OF THE MOST VAGUE AND INCONCLUSIVE CHARACTER
WHERE A MAN'S BODY MIGHT POSSIBLY LIE CONCEALED EVERY TRACT OF BUSH AND WOODLAND EVERY BARN AND OUT BUILDING EVERY HOLLOW AND DITCH EVERY FIELD AND FENCE CORNER WAS EXPLORED WITH CAREFUL MINUTENESS EVEN THE WELLS OF THE DISTRICT WERE PEERED INTO
YET THAT FLASH OF TEMPER HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO FACE THE ORDEAL A LINGERING RESENTMENT AT GRAHAM'S SUGGESTION LESSENED THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION ENTERING THE COURT HE SCARCELY GLANCED AT THE BLACK WAGON THERE WERE MORE DARK CLOTHED MEN IN THE HALL RAWLINS HAD RETURNED
PERRY PROFESSED TO HAVE SEEN AND CONVERSED WITH HIM THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT INTERVIEW AND CONVERSATION HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND SAVAREEN HAD RIDDEN NORTHWARD FROM THE GATE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS HE COULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED
ROBINSON JERKED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS OUT THERE
BOBBY LOOKED UP ISN'T THAT AN AUTOMOBILE COMING THROUGH THE WOODS HE ASKED MAYBE RAWLINS BACK FROM SMITHTOWN OR THE MINISTER THE CAR STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE COURT THEY HEARD THE REMOTE TINKLING OF THE FRONT DOOR BELL JENKINS PASSED THROUGH
USUALLY OCCUPIED BY THE INTELLECT BROTHERS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
IN ITSELF BEAST LIKE AND UNNATURAL AT LAST A HARSH VOICE CAME TO BOBBY ITS BREVITY POINTED THE PREVIOUS DUMBNESS OF THE SPEAKER DEEP ENOUGH AND BOBBY TURNED AND HURRIED BACK ALONG THE ROUGHLY RESTORED PATH
I SLEPT LIKE A TOP LAST NIGHT I HEARD NOTHING I SAW NOTHING OUGHT I TO WANT YOU TO STAND BY ME BOBBY SAID OUGHTN'T I TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE TO DIRECT YOUR BODY WHEN YOUR MIND NO LONGER CONTROLLED IT IT'S A NASTY THOUGHT BUT I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS YOU MEAN CARLOS MAY HAVE MADE ME GO TO THE HALL LAST NIGHT PERHAPS SENT ME TO THE OLD ROOM THOSE OTHER TIMES
BLUE THE ONLY COLOR WE CAN FEEL INVISIBLE BLUE A POLICEMAN BLUSH A TEMPORARY ERYTHEMA AND CALORIFIC EFFULGENCE OF THE PHYSIOGNOMY AETEOLOGIZED BY THE PERCEPTIVENESS OF THE SENSORIUM
SO FOR THE SECOND TIME THE LIVING MET THE DEAD AND THE LAW WATCHED HOPEFULLY
COULD HE WITNESS THE DEFINITE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS GRANDFATHER IN A NARROW BOX COULD HE WATCH THE COVERING EARTH FALL NOISILY IN THAT BLEAK PLACE OF SILENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING FOR ROBINSON
GRAHAM SUMMONED KATHERINE ONE OF THE BLACK CLOTHED MEN OPENED THE DOOR OF SILAS BLACKBURN'S ROOM HE STEPPED ASIDE BECKONING
ADVERTISEMENTS SETTING FORTH THE MAIN FACTS WERE INSERTED IN THE PRINCIPAL NEWSPAPERS OF TORONTO HAMILTON AND LONDON
DISTINGUISHED FROM MENU BY FIGURES IN THE RIGHT HAND COLUMN BIOGRAPH A STEREOPTICON PICTURE TAKEN WITH A CHILL AND SHOWN WITH TREMORS BIRDIE

OR HEAVEN FOR SMACKS THE YEAR AROUND BENEDICT A MARRIED MALE BENEDICTINE A MARRIED FEMALE BENEDICTION THEIR CHILDREN BERTH AN AID TO SLEEP INVENTED BY PULLMAN LOWER PREFERRED
AND HE HAD ASKED FOR MONEY ONLY A TRIFLING SUM YET GRAHAM WOULD GRASP AT THE FACT TO SUPPORT HIS EARLIER SUSPICION PAREDES'S ARRIVAL POSSESSED ONE VIRTUE IT DIVERTED BOBBY'S THOUGHTS TEMPORARILY FROM HIS OWN DILEMMA FROM HIS INABILITY TO CHART A COURSE
BARS THINGS FOUND IN HARBORS HOTELS FENCES PRISONS COURTS AND MUSIC
YOUR PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE WAS THE LAST STRAW YOU WILL FORGIVE US CARLOS
NO HURRY BOBBY ANSWERED WITH A QUICK INTAKE OF BREATH I SUPPOSE NOT ROBINSON SNEERED SINCE EVERYBODY KNOWS WELL ENOUGH WHAT'S IN IT BOBBY AROSE ROBINSON STILL SNEERED YOU'LL BE AT THE GRAVE AS CHIEF MOURNER
HUMAN BLOCK KNOWN AS THE CRANIUM AND KEPT BY THE SARAH SISTERS SARAH BRUM AND SARAH BELUM ASSISTED BY MEDULLA OBLONGATA
NO I WON'T BELIEVE IT I'VE BEEN WEAK HARTLEY BUT NOT THAT WEAK AND I TELL YOU I DID FEEL HOWELLS'S BODY MOVE UNDER MY HAND DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME GRAHAM SAID GENTLY I MUST CONSIDER EVERY POSSIBILITY YOU WERE EXCITED AND IMAGINATIVE WHEN YOU WENT TO THE OLD ROOM TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE
LAPIERRE GAVE UP ALL HIS TIME TO THE SEARCH AND LEFT THE ROYAL OAK TO THE CARE OF ITS LANDLADY THE LOCAL CONSTABULARY BESTIRRED THEMSELVES AS THEY HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE
PUSHED THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING HE TURNED GRAHAM FULLY DRESSED STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE BED THOSE MEN BOBBY ASKED WEARILY THE GRAVE DIGGERS GRAHAM ANSWERED THEY ARE GOING TO WORK IN THE OLD CEMETERY TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR SILAS BLACKBURN
WHY HE SHOULD FAIL TO REFER TO BOBBY'S QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT OF HIS ARREST OR TO THE OPENLY EXPRESSED ENMITY OF GRAHAM ONLY ONE THEORY PROMISED TO FIT AT ALL IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PANAMANIAN TO RETURN TO THE CEDARS
THE WOMAN AT THE LAKE AND IN THE COURTYARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND THE VANISHING OF THE EVIDENCE UNDER HIS HAND PAREDES'S ODD BEHAVIOUR ALL BECAME IN HIS MIND PUZZLING DETAILS THAT FAILED TO OBSCURE THE CHIEF FACT
FROM A SENSE OF SHAME ANGER OR OTHER CAUSE
AND WHITE AND FURNISHED WITH LIGHT AND HEAT HOT OR COLD WATER IF DESIRED
ROBINSON ENTERED THE FLESH AROUND HIS EYES WAS PUFFIER THAN IT HAD BEEN YESTERDAY WORRY HAD INCREASED THE INCONGRUOUS DISCONTENT OF HIS ROUND FACE CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT LITTLE I SAW YOU ARRIVE HE SAID RAWLINS WARNED ME
WHEN BOBBY HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HE FOUND IN SPITE OF HIS MENTAL TURMOIL THAT HIS SLEEP HAD DONE HIM GOOD WHILE HE BREAKFASTED GRAHAM URGED HIM TO EAT TRIED TO DRIVE FROM HIS BRAIN THE MORBID AFTERMATH OF LAST NIGHT'S REVEALING MOMENT
MIGHT HAVE MOVED SPASMODICALLY I MEAN
BUT SHE WAS HAUNTED BY A DREAD THAT SHE WOULD NEVER AGAIN SEE HER HUSBAND ALIVE NEXT MORNING SOON AFTER DAYLIGHT THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ASTIR AND THE COUNTRY ROUND WAS CAREFULLY SEARCHED FOR ANY TRACE OF THE MISSING MAN
SCRATCHED AND WITH BROKEN HANDLES THE CLOSED COLONIAL DESK THE MISERLY RAG CARPET ALL SEEMED MUTELY ASKING AS BOBBY DID
HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
HIS EYES STUDYING THE FIRE HIS FINGERS ON THE CHAIR ARM WERE RESTLESS DOCTOR GROOM STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TALKING WITH THE CLERGYMAN A STOUT AND UNCTUOUS FIGURE
A STITCH IN TIME SAVES EMBARRASSING EXPOSURE
PRAECORDIA BOARD AN IMPLEMENT FOR ADMINISTERING CORPORAL PUNISHMENT USED BY MOTHERS AND LAND LADIES THE FESTIVE BOARD MAY BE A SHINGLE A HAIR BRUSH
SUCH A FIGURE WAS APPROPRIATE TO THE CEDARS
GRAHAM ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ILL AT EASE
DULL CLOUDS OBSCURED THE SUN AND FURNISHED AN ILLUSION OF CROWDING EARTHWARD A FUNEREAL DAY THE WORDS SLIPPED INTO HIS MIND HE REPEATED THEM WHEN YOUR GRANDFATHER'S BURIED GRAHAM ANSWERED SOFTLY WE'LL ALL FEEL HAPPIER WHY BOBBY ASKED
GRAHAM FROWNED IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH YOUR SLEEP WALKING LAST NIGHT YET IT'S AS CLEAR AS EVER THAT MARIA AND HE ARE UP TO SOME GAME IN WHICH YOU FIGURE HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL BOBBY PERSISTED GET UP GRAHAM ADVISED
LATER MISTER GRAHAM THERE IS A HACK DRIVER OUTSIDE WHO IS EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN YOU HE WANTS TO BE PAID I ASKED RAWLINS TO DRIVE ME BACK BUT HE RUSHED FROM THE COURTHOUSE PROBABLY TO TELEPHONE HIS ROTUND SUPERIOR
THAT FLEETING SATANIC IMPRESSION OF YESTERDAY CAME BACK SHARPER MORE ALARMING PAREDES'S CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS STRENGTH HIS MIND WAS SUBTLER THAN THEIRS
WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT THIS EFFECTUALLY DISPOSED OF ANY POSSIBLE THEORY AS TO JONATHAN AND HIS WIFE HAVING MISTAKEN SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SAVAREEN SQUIRE HARRINGTON LIKEWISE LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE MAN'S DOINGS ON THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
OR AT THE VERY OUTSIDE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER OR HE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED BY LAPIERRE
FORCED INTO HIS MIND A CLEANSING STIMULATION BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EVEN THAT PROPHYLACTIC WAS DENIED HIM WITH HIS DIRECTION A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE CHANCE LED HIM INTO THE THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE
BONE ONE DOLLAR THE ORIGINAL PRICE OF A WIFE NOTE ADAM WHO HAD TO GIVE UP ONE BONE BEFORE HE GOT EVE BONNETS A FEMALE HEAD TROUBLE WHICH IS CONTRACTED THE LATTER PART OF LENT AND BREAKS OUT ON EASTER BOODLE
OVERCOAT I'VE NEARLY FROZEN DRIVING FROM SMITHTOWN BEFORE EITHER MAN COULD GROPE FOR A SUITABLE GREETING HE FACED BOBBY
AND DEPOSITED ON A DRY PATCH OF GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE MORASS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE INTERIOR THEY CAME UPON A MAN'S COAT MADE OF DARK BROWN STUFF
THE FORMER EASY MANNERED UNCOMMUNICATIVE FOREIGNER HE APPEARED MOREOVER TO HAVE SLEPT PLEASANTLY HIS EYES SHOWED NO WEARINESS HIS CLOTHING NO DISARRANGEMENT HE SPOKE AT ONCE
I WON'T BLAME CARLOS FOR THAT BOBBY MUTTERED HE INFLUENCED YOU AGAINST YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT GRAHAM PERSISTED TO REFUSE TO LEAVE WITH ME THE NIGHT OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH MARIA DID HER SHARE BOBBY SAID HE BROKE OFF LOOKING AT GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
AND DEVELOPED IN DEPARTMENT STORES ON MONDAYS SYMPTOMS LOUD TALK PUSHING AND SHOVING A COMBINATION PRIZE FIGHT AND FOOT BALL SCRIMMAGE OLD SPELLING BARK GAIN BASEBALL
WHAT YOUR FRIENDS CALL YOU BEFORE YOU GO TO THE WALL BUT NEVER AFTERWARD BRIMSTONE A LITTLE BIT OF HADES WHICH FINDS ITS MATCH ON EARTH AND SMELLS TO HEAVEN BETTER TO STRIKE IT HERE THAN IN THE HEREAFTER BREVITY
BUT I MUST SAY I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D USE YOUR FREEDOM TO COME TO US
FROM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH DOCTOR SCOTT THE LOCAL CORONER HELD HIMSELF IN READINESS TO SUMMON A CORONER'S JURY AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE WHEN ALL THESE MEASURES PROVED UNAVAILING A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE INHABITANTS WAS CONVENED AND FUNDS WERE SUBSCRIBED TO STILL FURTHER PROSECUTE THE SEARCH
MAY BE FOUND IN A CASH BOOK OR THE KANGAROO GAIT BANDIT AN OUTLAW SEE ALDERMAN BARBER A BRILLIANT CONVERSATIONALIST WHO OCCASIONALLY SHAVES AND CUTS HAIR
FOR ONCE HE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE FOREST BECAUSE IT HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO GLANCE PERPETUALLY BACK AT THAT DISMAL AND PENSIVE PICTURE THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF TWIGS HASTILY LOPPED OFF OF BUSHES BENT AND TORN OF THE UNCOVERING THROUGH THESE CARELESS MEANS OF AN OLD PATH
HENCE AN UNATTACHED MAN WHICH ANY LADY MAY STICK STICK TO OR GET STUCK ON BACKBITER A MOSQUITO BALANCE SOMETHING WANTED BY BOOK KEEPERS AND OFTEN LOST BY TOPERS
HE ASKED HE IGNORES WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY HE SETTLES HIMSELF IN THE CEDARS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT BOBBY ANSWERED THIS MORNING CARLOS GAVE ME THE CREEPS
AND WAS ABLE TO FIX THE TIME AT WHICH HE HAD STARTED FOR HOME HE HAD RIDDEN FROM THE DOOR OF THE PEACOCK AT ABOUT A QUARTER TO EIGHT
PAY HIM WILL YOU JENKINS THANKS
TO A MAN SHE IS PLAYING FOR A JAY BIRTHDAY ANNIVERSARY OF ONE'S BIRTH OBSERVED ONLY BY MEN AND CHILDREN BLUBBER THE USEFUL PRODUCT OF A DEAD WHALE THE USELESS PRODUCT OF A LIVE BABY
THE SEARCH WAS KEPT UP WITHOUT INTERMISSION FOR SEVERAL DAYS NEARLY ALL OF THE FARMERS IN THE VICINITY TAKING PART IN IT EVEN TO THE NEGLECT OF THE HARVEST WORK WHICH DEMANDED THEIR ATTENTION SQUIRE HARRINGTON WAS ESPECIALLY ACTIVE AND LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY
IF THE OLD MAN IN HIS SELFISHNESS HAD PAUSED TO GAZE BEYOND THE INEVITABLE FACT OF DEATH
CHAPTER SEVEN THE AMAZING MEETING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE OLD COURTYARD BOBBY RETURNED TO HIS BED HE LAY THERE STILL SHIVERING BENEATH THE HEAVY BLANKETS I DON'T DARE HE ECHOED GRAHAM'S WORDS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ANY ONE CAN SAY
BIRTH AN AID TO LIFE DISCOVERED BY WOMAN HIGHER PREFERRED BICYCLE SKIRT
HE GLANCED AWAY WHILE THE ANGRY COLOUR LEFT HIS FACE HE WAS A LITTLE DAZED BY THE REALIZATION THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO GRAHAM AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO AN ENEMY AS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HOWELLS IN THE OLD BEDROOM HE FELT THE TOUCH OF GRAHAM'S HAND ON HIS SHOULDER I'M ONLY WORKING IN YOUR SERVICE GRAHAM SAID KINDLY
THE DULL THUD OF EARTH FALLING REGULARLY HE PAUSED LISTENING THE LABOUR OF THE MEN WAS GIVEN AN UNCOUTH RHYTHM BY THEIR GRUNTING EXPULSIONS OF BREATH OTHERWISE THE NATURE OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM A SILENCE
FACT IS BOBBY I LEFT NEW YORK TOO SUDDENLY
HIS EYES STILL SMILED BUT HIS VOICE WAS HARDER BYGONES ARE BYGONES ISN'T THAT SO BOBBY SINCE YOU WISH IT BOBBY SAID BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE KNOWLEDGE GRAHAM DESIRED LOOMED THE OLD QUESTION WHAT WAS THE MAN'S GAME WHAT HELD HIM HERE
IF IT'S SO FAR FETCHED GRAHAM ASKED QUIETLY WHY DO YOU REVOLT FROM THE IDEA BOBBY TURNED ON HIM AND WHY DO YOU FILL MY MIND WITH SUCH THOUGHTS IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY SAY SO GO TELL ROBINSON SO
THAT'S WHY I'VE COME TO WAKE YOU UP THE MINISTER'S TELEPHONED KATHERINE HE WILL BE HERE BEFORE NOON DO YOU KNOW IT'S AFTER TEN O'CLOCK FOR SOME TIME BOBBY STARED THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE DESOLATE RAGGED LANDSCAPE IT WAS ABNORMALLY COLD EVEN FOR THE LATE FALL
THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
BOBBY WENT IN WITH THE OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT HE CATALOGUED REMEMBERED OBJECTS ALL INTIMATE TO HIS GRANDFATHER EACH ODDLY ENTANGLED IN HIS MIND WITH HIS DISLIKE OF THE OLD MAN THE IRON BED THE CHEST OF DRAWERS
SIR I HUMBLY BEG OF YOU TO GIVE YOUR CONSENT FOR AS SOON AS WE COME TO BAGDAD I DESIRE TO OFFER YOU MY PERSON TO BE YOUR SLAVE
IS IT FROM IGNORANCE OF WHAT IS GOOD WELL WHAT IS MORE WEAK AND FEEBLE THAN THE BLINDNESS OF IGNORANCE DO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY OUGHT TO FOLLOW BUT LUST DRIVES THEM ASIDE OUT OF THE WAY IF IT BE SO THEY ARE STILL FRAIL BY REASON OF THEIR INCONTINENCE
FOR IF THIS EVER GAPING EVER CRAVING WANT IS GLUTTED BY WEALTH IT NEEDS MUST BE THAT THE WANT ITSELF WHICH CAN BE SO GLUTTED STILL REMAINS I DO NOT SPEAK OF HOW VERY LITTLE SUFFICES FOR NATURE
I SOON DRIED MY CLOTHES IN THE SUN AND AS I WALKED ALONG I FOUND SEVERAL KINDS OF FRUIT AND LIKEWISE FRESH WATER WHICH GAVE ME SOME HOPES OF PRESERVING MY LIFE I HAD JUST LAID MYSELF DOWN TO REST IN A SHADE
WHO SO ATTAINS THE END OF HIS DESIRES THAT NOTHING FURTHER TO BE DESIRED LIES BEYOND WHENCE FOLLOWS THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THEY WHO ARE WICKED ARE SEEN LIKEWISE TO BE WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH FOR WHY DO THEY FORSAKE VIRTUE AND FOLLOW VICE
BUT WHICH THEY CANNOT WIN OR HOLD NAY THEIR FAILURE CONCERNS THE VERY SUM AND CROWN OF THINGS POOR WRETCHES THEY FAIL TO COMPASS EVEN THAT FOR WHICH THEY TOIL DAY AND NIGHT
SUCH AS JEWELS GOLD AND MONEY WE LEFT THE FURNITURE AND GOODS WHICH CONSISTED OF AN INFINITE QUANTITY OF PLATE
WHICH WAS INESTIMABLE IN VALUE WERE IT ONLY FOR THE DIAMOND I MENTIONED THE DOORS BEING ALL OPEN OR BUT HALF SHUT I SURVEYED SOME OTHER APARTMENTS THAT WERE AS BEAUTIFUL AS THOSE I HAD ALREADY SEEN
THE WISE ALONE ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY WOULD WHILE THE WICKED FOLLOW THEIR OWN HEARTS LUST BUT CAN NOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY WOULD FOR THEY GO ON IN THEIR WILFULNESS
I LOST MYSELF AMONG THE APARTMENTS AND PERCEIVING I WAS COME BACK AGAIN TO THE LARGE ROOM WHERE THE THRONE THE COUCH THE LARGE DIAMOND AND THE TORCHES STOOD I RESOLVED TO TAKE MY NIGHT'S LODGING THERE AND TO DEPART THE NEXT MORNING EARLY
READING WITH GREAT DEVOTION THE KORAUN WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM ON A DESK AT THIS SIGHT I WAS TRANSPORTED WITH ADMIRATION I WONDERED HOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT HE SHOULD BE THE ONLY LIVING CREATURE
CAN WANT BE DRIVEN AWAY BY RICHES CANNOT THE RICH FEEL HUNGER CANNOT THEY THIRST ARE NOT THE LIMBS OF THE WEALTHY SENSITIVE TO THE WINTER'S COLD BUT THOU WILT SAY
CANNOT MAKE ITS POSSESSOR INDEPENDENT AND FREE FROM ALL WANT YET THIS WAS WHAT IT SEEMED TO PROMISE MOREOVER I THINK THIS ALSO WELL DESERVES TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE SPECIAL NATURE OF MONEY
HER HUSBAND HAD TREATED HER AFTER THE SAME MANNER AND I RECEIVED HER LIKEWISE WITH THE SAME AFFECTION AS I HAD DONE THE FORMER SOME TIME AFTER MY TWO SISTERS
IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE WHOLE AIM OF MAN'S WILL THOUGH THE MEANS OF PURSUIT VARY IS SET INTENTLY UPON HAPPINESS I DO REMEMBER THAT THIS TOO WAS PROVED DOST THOU ALSO CALL TO MIND HOW HAPPINESS IS ABSOLUTE GOOD
LACK MANY GOOD THINGS IS NOT THE HAPPINESS MEN SEEK IN THEM CLEARLY DISCOVERED TO BE A FALSE SHOW THEREFORE DO I FIRST ASK THEE THYSELF WHO BUT LATELY WERT LIVING IN AFFLUENCE AMID ALL THAT ABUNDANCE OF WEALTH
THE ABILITY TO COMMIT CRIME CANNOT BE REFERRED TO THE GOOD THEREFORE IT IS NOT A THING TO BE DESIRED AND YET ALL POWER IS DESIRABLE IT IS CLEAR THEN THAT ABILITY TO DO EVIL IS NOT POWER
I CONCLUDED IT TO BE THE QUEEN'S APARTMENTS I ENTERED AND IN A LARGE HALL I FOUND SEVERAL BLACK EUNUCHS TURNED INTO STONE I WENT FROM THENCE INTO A ROOM RICHLY FURNISHED
MY TEARS TESTIFY WITH HOW MUCH SORROW AND RELUCTANCE
AND PROVED TO BE A FLAT ON THE COAST WHICH WHEN DAY APPEARED I FOUND TO BE A DESERT ISLAND
WILL GIVE YOU FULL INFORMATION IN THE RELATION OF HER STORY AFTER THE CALIPH HAD HEARD ZOBEIDE WITH MUCH ASTONISHMENT
WHICH STOOD OPEN A CURTAIN OF SILK STUFF SEEMED TO BE DRAWN BEFORE IT A LAMP HUNG OVER THE ENTRANCE AFTER I HAD SURVEYED THE BUILDING I MADE NO DOUBT BUT IT WAS THE PALACE OF THE PRINCE WHO REIGNED OVER THAT COUNTRY
THE BAD HAVE AN ABILITY NOR DO I WISH TO DENY IT ONLY THIS ABILITY OF THEIRS COMES NOT FROM STRENGTH BUT FROM IMPOTENCE FOR THEIR ABILITY IS TO DO EVIL
WHERE I BOUGHT A SHIP READY FITTED FOR SEA
I HAVE NOT ALTERED MY MIND WITH RESPECT TO YOU SINCE WE LAST PARTED COME AGAIN AND TAKE PART OF WHAT I HAVE UPON THIS I EMBRACED THEM AND WE LIVED TOGETHER AS BEFORE
AFTER WE HAD LADEN THE VESSEL WITH WHAT WE THOUGHT MOST DESIRABLE WE TOOK SUCH PROVISIONS AND WATER ABOARD AS WERE NECESSARY FOR OUR VOYAGE
AFTER THE SAME MANNER AND IN THE SAME TONE AS IT IS READ IN OUR MOSQUES BEING EXTREMELY GLAD TO HEAR IT I IMMEDIATELY AROSE AND TAKING A TORCH IN MY HAND PASSED FROM ONE CHAMBER TO ANOTHER
FOR I AM THE YOUNGEST MARRIED AND LEFT ME ALONE SOME TIME AFTER MY ELDEST SISTER'S HUSBAND SOLD ALL THAT HE HAD AND WITH THAT MONEY AND MY SISTER'S PORTION THEY WENT BOTH INTO AFRICA WHERE HER HUSBAND
THE NAME OF THE OTHER IS SAFIE AND MY OWN ZOBEIDE AFTER OUR FATHER'S DEATH THE PROPERTY THAT HE LEFT WAS EQUALLY DIVIDED AMONG US AND
FOR THEY CANNOT FIGHT AGAINST VICE OR DO THEY KNOWINGLY AND WILFULLY FORSAKE THE GOOD AND TURN ASIDE TO VICE WHY AT THIS RATE THEY NOT ONLY CEASE TO HAVE POWER BUT CEASE TO BE AT ALL FOR THEY WHO FORSAKE THE COMMON END OF ALL THINGS THAT ARE
WHILE THE BAD ARE LEFT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH
SHE DELIVERED TO ME THE TWO BITCHES AND SAID IF YOU WOULD NOT BE CHANGED INTO A SIMILAR FORM I COMMAND YOU IN THE NAME OF HIM THAT GOVERNS THE SEA TO GIVE EACH OF YOUR SISTERS EVERY NIGHT ONE HUNDRED LASHES WITH A ROD
I APPROACHED IN HOPES TO FIND SOME
WHEREAS THE BAD TRY TO ATTAIN THIS SAME GOOD THROUGH ALL MANNER OF CONCUPISCENCE WHICH IS NOT THE NATURAL WAY OF ATTAINING GOOD OR DOST THOU THINK OTHERWISE NAY RATHER ONE FURTHER CONSEQUENCE IS CLEAR TO ME
AND MAY HE BE GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO PROTECT US IN THE SAME MANNER
THE OTHER ATTAIN IT NOT IS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT THE GOOD ARE ENDUED WITH POWER WHILE THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE WEAK IF ANY DOUBT IT HE IS INCAPABLE OF REFLECTING ON THE NATURE OF THINGS OR THE CONSEQUENCES INVOLVED IN REASONING
I FOUND MOST OF THE SHOPS SHUT AND IN SUCH AS WERE OPEN I LIKEWISE FOUND THE PEOPLE PETRIFIED HAVING REACHED A VAST SQUARE IN THE HEART OF THE CITY I PERCEIVED A LARGE FOLDING GATE COVERED WITH PLATES OF GOLD
AND ASKED HER WHO SHE WAS I AM SAID SHE THE SERPENT WHOM YOU LATELY DELIVERED FROM MY MORTAL ENEMY
FOR HE WAS METAMORPHOSED INTO A BLACK STONE AS HE IS TO BE SEEN IN THIS PALACE AND THE QUEEN MY MOTHER HAD THE LIKE DESTINY I AM THE ONLY PERSON WHO DID NOT SUFFER UNDER THAT HEAVY JUDGMENT
IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DARE VENTURE A SECOND TIME YOU KNOW HOW RARE IT IS TO MEET WITH A HUSBAND PERFECTLY VIRTUOUS AND DESERVING BELIEVE WHAT I SAY AND LET US LIVE TOGETHER AS COMFORTABLY AS WE CAN
VERILY WONDROUS GREAT ARE THY PROMISES YET I DO NOT DOUBT BUT THOU CANST MAKE THEM GOOD ONLY KEEP ME NOT IN SUSPENSE AFTER RAISING SUCH HOPES LEARN THEN FIRST SAID SHE HOW THAT POWER EVER WAITS UPON THE GOOD
AS WE WERE ONE DAY CONVERSING ABOUT OUR THIRD SISTER AND WONDERING WE RECEIVED NO INTELLIGENCE OF HER
AND HANGING OUT ITS TONGUE WHICH INDUCED ME TO CONCLUDE IT HAD RECEIVED SOME INJURY I INSTANTLY AROSE AND PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS PURSUED BY A LARGER SERPENT WHICH HAD HOLD OF ITS TAIL AND WAS ENDEAVOURING TO DEVOUR IT
AS SOON AS THESE TWO SISTERS RECEIVED THEIR PORTIONS THEY LEFT ME TO LIVE WITH THEIR MOTHER MY OTHER TWO SISTERS AND MYSELF STAYED WITH OUR MOTHER WHO WAS THEN ALIVE AND WHO WHEN SHE AFTERWARDS DIED
BUT NOT BEFORE SHE HAD PERFECTLY INSTRUCTED ME IN ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY TO CONVINCE ME OF THE TRUTH OF THE MOOSULMAUN RELIGION AFTER HER DEATH I PERSISTED WITH CONSTANCY IN THE BELIEF OF ITS DIVINITY
I TOOK HER TO A BATH CLOTHED HER WITH MY OWN APPAREL AND THUS ADDRESSED HER SISTER YOU ARE THE ELDER AND I ESTEEM YOU AS MY MOTHER DURING YOUR ABSENCE GOD HAS BLEST THE PORTION THAT FELL TO MY SHARE
HE ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND WE CONVERSED THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT CONCERNING OUR EMBARKATION AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY WE LEFT THE PALACE
AND HOW FOR AVARICE NOTHING IS ENOUGH WHEREFORE IF WEALTH CANNOT GET RID OF WANT AND MAKES NEW WANTS OF ITS OWN
MY VESSEL IS AT YOUR SERVICE
JUDGE WHAT WAS MY SURPRISE WHEN I AWOKE TO SEE STANDING BY ME A BLACK WOMAN OF LIVELY AND AGREEABLE FEATURES WHO HELD IN HER HAND TWO BITCHES OF THE SAME COLOUR FASTENED TOGETHER I SAT UP
HOWEVER IT MADE ME IMAGINE THAT THERE WAS SOME LIVING CREATURE IN THIS PLACE FOR I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TORCHES CONTINUED THUS BURNING OF THEMSELVES SEVERAL OTHER RARITIES DETAINED MY CURIOSITY IN THIS ROOM
HOWEVER TO WIN AMPLER CREDENCE FOR MY CONCLUSION I WILL PURSUE BOTH PATHS AND DRAW CONFIRMATION FOR MY STATEMENTS FIRST IN ONE WAY AND THEN IN THE OTHER THE CARRYING OUT OF ANY HUMAN ACTION DEPENDS UPON TWO THINGS
FOR IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED SEVERAL VESSELS MORE TO CONVEY TO BAGDAD
WITH ONE INDISTINGUISHABLE PURPOSE STRIVE TO REACH GOOD YES THAT FOLLOWS BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT BY THE ATTAINMENT OF GOOD MEN BECOME GOOD IT IS THEN DO THE GOOD ATTAIN THEIR OBJECT
ON THAT SIDE FROM WHENCE THE SOUND PROCEEDED I CAME TO THE CLOSET DOOR AND STOOD STILL NOT DOUBTING THAT IT CAME FROM THENCE I SET DOWN MY TORCH UPON THE GROUND
WHOM I HAVE TRANSFORMED INTO THIS SHAPE BUT THIS PUNISHMENT WILL NOT SUFFICE AND MY WILL IS THAT YOU TREAT THEM HEREAFTER
AND THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT GRATIFYING MY CURIOSITY IN THE MEAN TIME NIGHT CAME ON WHICH REMINDED ME THAT IT WAS TIME TO RETIRE I PROPOSED TO RETURN THE WAY I HAD ENTERED BUT I COULD NOT FIND IT
AND UPON THE THRONE THERE WAS A BED OF RICH STUFF EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS WHAT SURPRISED ME MOST WAS A SPARKLING LIGHT WHICH CAME FROM ABOVE THE BED BEING CURIOUS TO KNOW WHENCE IT PROCEEDED I ASCENDED THE STEPS
YET IN SOME WISE NOTWITHSTANDING YE DISCERN THE TRUE END OF HAPPINESS AND SO THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS YOU THITHER TO THAT TRUE GOOD WHILE ERROR IN MANY FORMS LEADS YOU ASTRAY THEREFROM
WHEN I HAD DONE I PRAYED HIM TO PERFORM HIS PROMISE AND TOLD HIM HOW MUCH I WAS STRUCK BY THE FRIGHTFUL DESOLATION WHICH I HAD SEEN IN THE CITY LADY SAID THE YOUNG MAN HAVE PATIENCE FOR A MOMENT
FOR SINCE GOOD AND EVIL ARE CONTRARIES IF IT IS MADE PLAIN THAT GOOD IS POWER THE FEEBLENESS OF EVIL IS CLEARLY SEEN AND CONVERSELY IF THE FRAIL NATURE OF EVIL IS MADE MANIFEST THE STRENGTH OF GOOD IS THEREBY KNOWN
BUT ABUNDANTLY MORE WISE THAN WE IF YOU WILL VOUCHSAFE TO RECEIVE US ONCE MORE INTO YOUR HOUSE AND ACCOUNT US YOUR SLAVES WE SHALL NEVER COMMIT A SIMILAR FAULT AGAIN MY ANSWER WAS DEAR SISTERS
THAT THIS SOLITARY LIFE IS EXTREMELY IRKSOME ALL THESE EXPRESSIONS AND PARTICULARLY THE LAST GREATLY INCREASED MY LOVE FOR HIM PRINCE SAID I THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT PROVIDENCE HAS BROUGHT ME INTO YOUR PORT TO AFFORD YOU AN OPPORTUNITY
YOU MUST KNOW THAT THIS CITY WAS THE METROPOLIS OF A MIGHTY KINGDOM OVER WHICH THE SULTAN MY FATHER REIGNED THAT PRINCE HIS WHOLE COURT THE INHABITANTS OF THE CITY AND ALL HIS OTHER SUBJECTS
WHY CERTAINLY NOT THERE IS NO DENYING IT CANST THOU THEN DOUBT THAT HE WHOM THOU SEEST TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT HE WILLED
AND AT LAST CAME INTO A LARGE ROOM WHERE THERE WAS A THRONE OF MASSIVE GOLD
BRING WITH THEM ANYTHING OF SUCH SORT AS SEEMS TO HAVE NOTHING WANTING TO IT THAT IS GOOD WE TOO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME ARE MADE HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF THESE THINGS BUT IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FULFIL THEIR PROMISES AND MOREOVER
WHO CAN VENTURE TO DENY IT YET HE WOULD NOT UNLESS HE POSSESSED THE MONEY WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE NO HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT
THE IMPORTANT SERVICES YOU HAVE RENDERED ME THAN BY WHAT I HAVE JUST DONE THE TREACHERY OF YOUR SISTERS WAS WELL KNOWN TO ME AND TO AVENGE YOUR WRONGS AS SOON AS I WAS LIBERATED BY YOUR GENEROUS ASSISTANCE
AT LAST WE SET SAIL WITH A WIND AS FAVOURABLE AS WE COULD WISH THE YOUNG PRINCE MY SISTERS AND MYSELF ENJOYED OURSELVES FOR SOME TIME VERY AGREEABLY BUT ALAS THIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING DID NOT LAST LONG
THE DOOR BEING ONLY HALF SHUT I OPENED IT WENT IN AND STANDING UPRIGHT BEFORE THE NICHE I REPEATED THIS PRAYER ALOUD PRAISE BE TO GOD WHO HAS FAVOURED US WITH A HAPPY VOYAGE
TO HINDER ITS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THOSE WHO POSSESS IT AGAINST THEIR WILL I ADMIT IT WHY OF COURSE WHEN EVERY DAY THE STRONGER WRESTS IT FROM THE WEAKER WITHOUT HIS CONSENT ELSE WHENCE COME LAWSUITS
WE CONTINUED THUS A WHOLE YEAR IN PERFECT LOVE AND HARMONY SEEING THAT GOD HAD INCREASED MY SMALL STOCK I PROJECTED A VOYAGE TO EMBARK SOME OF IT IN A COMMERCIAL SPECULATION TO THIS END
AT THESE WORDS HE SHUT THE KORAUN PUT IT INTO A RICH CASE AND LAID IT IN THE NICHE
AND THE YOUNG PRINCE WHOM THEY HAVE DROWNED I WAS FORCED TO PROMISE OBEDIENCE SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE WHIPPED THEM EVERY NIGHT THOUGH WITH REGRET WHEREOF YOUR MAJESTY HAS BEEN A WITNESS
IN A MANNER ANSWERABLE TO OUR CONDITION BUT I ADDED I RATHER BELIEVE YOU WISH TO MARRY AGAIN I SHALL FEEL MUCH SURPRISED IF SUCH BE THE CASE AFTER THE EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE HAD OF THE LITTLE SATISFACTION THERE IS IN WEDLOCK
WE SET SAIL WITH A FAIR WIND AND SOON CLEARED THE PERSIAN GULF WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE OPEN SEA WE STEERED OUR COURSE TO THE INDIES AND THE TWENTIETH DAY SAW LAND IT WAS A VERY HIGH MOUNTAIN
THE WORDS WERE THESE INHABITANTS ABANDON THE WORSHIP OF NARDOUN AND OF FIRE AND WORSHIP THE ONLY GOD WHO SHEWS MERCY THIS VOICE WAS HEARD THREE YEARS SUCCESSIVELY BUT NO ONE WAS CONVERTED
AND EVER SINCE I HAVE CONTINUED TO SERVE GOD WITH MORE FERVENCY THAN BEFORE I AM PERSUADED DEAR LADY THAT HE HAS SENT YOU HITHER FOR MY COMFORT FOR WHICH I RENDER HIM INFINITE THANKS FOR I MUST OWN
TOLD ME THEY INTENDED TO MARRY AGAIN I OBSERVED THAT IF PUTTING ME TO EXPENSE WAS THE ONLY REASON THEY MIGHT LAY THOSE THOUGHTS ASIDE AND BE WELCOME TO REMAIN FOR WHAT I HAD WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN US ALL THREE
I STOOD SOME TIME ADMIRING THE RICHES AND MAGNIFICENCE OF THE ROOM BUT ABOVE ALL
NO ONE BUT THE GUARDS IN THE VESTIBULE ALL PETRIFIED SOME STANDING SOME SITTING AND SOME LYING I CAME TO A LARGE COURT WHERE I SAW BEFORE ME A STATELY BUILDING THE WINDOWS OF WHICH WERE INCLOSED WITH GATES OF MESSY GOLD
FOR MY SISTERS GREW JEALOUS OF THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE PRINCE AND MYSELF AND MALICIOUSLY ASKED ME ONE DAY WHAT WE SHOULD DO WITH HIM WHEN WE CAME TO BAGDAD I PERCEIVED IMMEDIATELY
SORROW HIS SPIRIT VEXES SORE AND EMPTY HOPES DELUDE
SEE HIS PILES OF GOLD RISE HIGH THOUGH HE GATHER STORE OF TREASURE THAT CAN NEVER SATISFY THOUGH WITH PEARLS HIS GORGET BLAZES RAREST THAT THE OCEAN YIELDS THOUGH A HUNDRED HEAD OF OXEN TRAVAIL IN HIS AMPLE FIELDS
THAT NOTHING HAS MORE POWER THAN SUPREME GOOD WE DID SAID I BUT THAT SAME HIGHEST GOOD CANNOT DO EVIL CERTAINLY NOT IS THERE ANYONE THEN WHO THINKS THAT MEN ARE ABLE TO DO ALL THINGS NONE BUT A MADMAN
AS SOON AS I WAS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING IT SHE EXPLAINED TO ME ALL THE PASSAGES OF THIS EXCELLENT BOOK AND INFUSED PIETY INTO MY MIND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER OR ANY OTHER PERSON SHE HAPPENED TO DIE
BUT SINCE I SEE THEE SO READY AT UNDERSTANDING I WILL HEAP PROOF ON PROOF LOOK HOW MANIFEST IS THE EXTREMITY OF VICIOUS MEN'S WEAKNESS THEY CANNOT EVEN REACH THAT GOAL TO WHICH THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS AND ALMOST CONSTRAINS THEM
AND TO RESIGN MYSELF WHOLLY TO YOUR COMMANDS THE PRINCE REPLIED I KNOW NOT MADAM WHETHER YOU BE IN JEST OR NO BUT FOR MY PART I SERIOUSLY DECLARE BEFORE THESE LADIES YOUR SISTERS
AFTER I HAD PRESENTED MY SISTERS TO THE PRINCE I TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HINDERED MY RETURN THE DAY BEFORE HOW I HAD MET WITH THE YOUNG PRINCE HIS STORY AND THE CAUSE OF THE DESOLATION OF SO FINE A CITY
AND PERCEIVING IN HIM SO MUCH GOOD NATURE AND BEAUTY I FELT EMOTIONS I HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE HE MADE ME SIT DOWN BY HIM AND BEFORE HE BEGAN HIS DISCOURSE I COULD NOT FORBEAR SAYING WITH AN AIR THAT DISCOVERED THE SENTIMENTS I FELT
AND IN THIS YOUR MAJESTY MAY SEE I AM MORE TO BE PITIED THAN BLAMED IF THERE BE ANY THING ELSE RELATING TO MYSELF
WAS THY MIND NEVER TROUBLED IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME WRONG DONE TO THEE NAY SAID I
FOR REFLECT WHETHER MEN ARE ABLE TO WIN HAPPINESS BY THOSE MEANS THROUGH WHICH THEY THINK TO REACH THE PROPOSED END TRULY IF EITHER WEALTH RANK OR ANY OF THE REST
I ENTERED THE TOWN AND PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL STREETS WHERE AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS STOOD MEN IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES BUT ALL MOTIONLESS AND PETRIFIED IN THE QUARTER INHABITED BY THE MERCHANTS
AND I DARE ENGAGE TO PROMISE YOU SANCTUARY THERE UNTIL THE MIGHTY COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL
THE SHIP I CAME IN MAY SERVE IN SOME MEASURE TO CONVINCE YOU
AND WHY I ALONE AM SAFE IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A TERRIBLE DISASTER I TOLD HIM IN A FEW WORDS WHENCE I HAD COME WHAT HAD MADE ME UNDERTAKE THE VOYAGE AND HOW I SAFELY ARRIVED AT THE PORT AFTER TWENTY DAYS SAILING
THE SEAMEN WERE TAKEN UP SEVERAL DAYS IN UNLADING THE MERCHANDIZE I BROUGHT WITH ME AND EMBARKING
FOR FROM MY ADMISSIONS IT MUST NEEDS FOLLOW THAT THE GOOD HAVE POWER AND THE BAD ARE IMPOTENT THOU ANTICIPATEST RIGHTLY AND THAT AS PHYSICIANS RECKON IS A SIGN THAT NATURE IS SET WORKING
I RECEIVED HER WITH EVERY POSSIBLE TENDERNESS AND INQUIRING INTO THE CAUSE OF HER DISTRESS SHE TOLD ME WITH TEARS HOW INHUMANLY HER HUSBAND HAD BEHAVED TOWARDS HER HER MISFORTUNES AFFECTED ME AND I MINGLED MY TEARS WITH HERS
THE ABSENCE OF THE OTHER ADMITTED BUT A MAN LACKS THAT OF WHICH HE IS IN WANT HE DOES
INSTEAD OF WHICH IN A WAY OTHER THAN IS AGREEABLE TO ITS NATURE IT I WILL NOT SAY FULFILS ITS FUNCTION BUT FEIGNS TO FULFIL IT WHICH OF THESE TWO WOULD IN THY VIEW BE THE STRONGER I GUESS THY MEANING BUT I PRAY THEE
IT SEEMS SO BUT IF THE BAD WERE TO ATTAIN THE GOOD WHICH IS THEIR OBJECT THEY COULD NOT BE BAD NO
BY RIOTOUS LIVING AND DEBAUCHERY SPENT ALL AND FINDING HIMSELF REDUCED TO POVERTY FOUND A PRETEXT FOR DIVORCING MY SISTER
AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH WE PERCEIVED A GREAT TOWN HAVING A FRESH GALE WE SOON REACHED THE HARBOUR AND CAST ANCHOR I HAD NOT PATIENCE TO WAIT TILL MY SISTERS WERE DRESSED TO GO ALONG WITH ME BUT WENT ASHORE ALONE IN THE BOAT
THAT THEY PUT THIS QUESTION ON PURPOSE TO DISCOVER MY INCLINATIONS THEREFORE RESOLVING TO PUT IT OFF WITH A JEST I ANSWERED I WILL TAKE HIM FOR MY HUSBAND AND UPON THAT TURNING MYSELF TO THE PRINCE SAID
AND THE EMPLOYMENT I FOLLOW OF BREEDING SILK WORMS ASSURE YOURSELF THERE IS NOTHING I HAVE BUT IS AT YOUR SERVICE AND AS MUCH AT YOUR DISPOSAL AS MY OWN WE LIVED VERY COMFORTABLY TOGETHER FOR SOME MONTHS
THAT WE SHOULD ASSERT THAT THE BAD WHO FORM THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND DO NOT EXIST BUT THE FACT IS SO I DO NOT INDEED DENY THAT THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE BAD BUT THAT THEY ARE IN AN UNQUALIFIED AND ABSOLUTE SENSE I DENY
THE RICH HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO SATE THEIR HUNGER THE MEANS TO GET RID OF THIRST AND COLD TRUE ENOUGH WANT CAN THUS BE SOOTHED BY RICHES WHOLLY REMOVED IT CANNOT BE
WHEREAS IF THERE BE NO POWER THE WILL IS ALL IN VAIN AND SO IF THOU SEEST ANY MAN WISHING TO ATTAIN SOME END YET UTTERLY FAILING TO ATTAIN IT THOU CANST NOT DOUBT THAT HE LACKED THE POWER OF GETTING WHAT HE WISHED FOR
HEAR ME O LORD AND GRANT MY REQUEST THE YOUNG MAN TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS ME AND SAID MY GOOD LADY PRAY LET ME KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT HAS BROUGHT YOU TO THIS DESOLATE CITY
AND THEY HAD ALL SUCH DREADFUL COUNTENANCES THAT I WAS GREATLY ALARMED BUT PERCEIVING THEY REMAINED STATIONARY AND DID NOT SO MUCH AS MOVE THEIR EYES I TOOK COURAGE AND WENT NEARER WHEN I FOUND THEY WERE ALL TURNED INTO STONES
AND LIFTING UP MY HEAD SAW A DIAMOND AS LARGE AS THE EGG OF AN OSTRICH LYING UPON A LOW STOOL IT WAS SO PURE THAT I COULD NOT FIND THE LEAST BLEMISH IN IT AND IT SPARKLED WITH SO MUCH BRILLIANCY
AND TWO CANDLESTICKS WITH LARGE TAPERS OF WHITE WAX BURNING I SAW A LITTLE CARPET LAID DOWN LIKE THOSE WE HAVE TO KNEEL UPON WHEN WE SAY OUR PRAYERS AND A COMELY YOUNG MAN SAT ON THIS CARPET
THEN WE HAVE WORKED ROUND TO AN OPPOSITE CONCLUSION THE WEALTH WHICH WAS THOUGHT TO MAKE A MAN INDEPENDENT RATHER PUTS HIM IN NEED OF FURTHER PROTECTION HOW IN THE WORLD THEN
TO GET ABOARD MY SHIP I LAID MYSELF DOWN UPON A COUCH NOT WITHOUT SOME DREAD TO BE ALONE IN A DESOLATE PLACE AND THIS FEAR HINDERED MY SLEEP ABOUT MIDNIGHT
WHICH I HIT UPON THE HEAD AND KILLED THE OTHER FINDING ITSELF AT LIBERTY TOOK WING AND FLEW AWAY I LOOKED AFTER IT FOR SOME TIME TILL IT DISAPPEARED I THEN SOUGHT ANOTHER SHADY SPOT FOR REPOSE AND FELL ASLEEP
OF COURSE NOT THEN IN RESPECT OF WHAT HE CAN ACCOMPLISH A MAN IS TO BE RECKONED STRONG IN RESPECT OF WHAT HE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WEAK GRANTED SAID I THEN DOST THOU REMEMBER THAT BY OUR FORMER REASONINGS
WERE MAGI WORSHIPPERS OF FIRE AND OF NARDOUN THE ANCIENT KING OF THE GIANTS WHO REBELLED AGAINST GOD BUT THOUGH I WAS BORN OF AN IDOLATROUS FATHER AND MOTHER I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE IN MY YOUTH TO HAVE A GOVERNESS
AND LOOKED IN THE EYES OF THE QUESTING BOY SAID HE WHENEVER THE FIELDS ARE GREEN LIE STILL WHERE THE WILD ROSE FASHIONS A SCREEN
PARENTAL BLITHER SHE SAID QUITE FLAT HE'S AN AVERAGE GLUG AND HE'S RED AND FAT AND EXCEEDINGLY FAT AND RED AT THAT BUT THE FATHER JOI WHEN HE GAZED ON SYM DREAMED GREAT AND WONDERFUL THINGS FOR HIM
AND EVERYBODY LAUGHED LET THE JURY CONSIDER THEIR VERDICT THE KING SAID FOR ABOUT THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT DAY NO NO SAID THE QUEEN SENTENCE FIRST VERDICT AFTERWARDS
AND IN BRICKS OR ROAD METAL FOR GOODS YOU WILL SETTLE INDENTED BY YOUR MISTER GHONES CRIED THE GLUGS PRAISINGLY WHY HOW AMAZINGLY SMART OF INDUSTRIOUS GHONES
OH THE KING WAS RICH AND THE QUEEN WAS FAIR AND THEY MADE A VERY RESPECTABLE PAIR AND WHENEVER A GLUG IN THAT PEACEFUL LAND DID ANYTHING NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE HE LOOKED IN A BOOK AND CHARGED THAT GLUG WITH A CRIME CALLED CROOK
AND THIS WAS HER DREAM FIRST SHE DREAMED OF LITTLE ALICE HERSELF AND ONCE AGAIN THE TINY HANDS WERE CLASPED UPON HER KNEE AND THE BRIGHT EAGER EYES WERE LOOKING UP INTO HERS SHE COULD HEAR THE VERY TONES OF HER VOICE
AH HE'S GETTING SENSE SAY THE ELDERLY FOLK BUT SYM
YOU NEVER HAD FITS MY DEAR I THINK HE SAID TO THE QUEEN NEVER SAID THE QUEEN FURIOUSLY THROWING AN INKSTAND AT THE LIZARD AS SHE SPOKE THE UNFORTUNATE LITTLE BILL HAD LEFT OFF WRITING ON HIS SLATE WITH ONE FINGER
AND HOW SHE WOULD GATHER ABOUT HER OTHER LITTLE CHILDREN AND MAKE THEIR EYES BRIGHT AND EAGER WITH MANY A STRANGE TALE PERHAPS EVEN WITH THE DREAM OF WONDERLAND OF LONG AGO AND HOW SHE WOULD FEEL WITH ALL THEIR SIMPLE SORROWS
WHY CLIMB SAID HE WHEN YOU REACH THE TOP THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO AND YOU HAVE TO STOP UNLESS YOU DROP AND THE HIGHER YOU ARE THE WORSE YOU FLOP AND EVERY CRICKET THAT CHIRPS AT EVE AND SCOFFS AT THE FOLLY OF FOOLS WHO GRIEVE
AND THE VOICE OF JOI WAS A LONELY VOICE WHEN HE RAILED AT GOSH FOR ITS FOOLISH CHOICE BUT THE GREAT KING GRINNED AND THE GOOD QUEEN GUSHED AS THE GOODS OF THE OGS WERE MADLY RUSHED AND THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND
BEING QUITE UNABLE TO MOVE SHE SOON GOT IT OUT AGAIN AND PUT IT RIGHT NOT THAT IT SIGNIFIES MUCH SHE SAID TO HERSELF
SO SYM WENT OFF AND A YEAR RAN BY AND THE FATHER SAID WITH A SMILE MASKED SIGH IT IS MEET THAT THE YOUNG SHOULD LEAVE THE NEST SAID THE AUNT DON'T SPILL THAT SOUP ON YOUR VEST
FOR THEY FEAR TO TEAR THE VERY EXPENSIVE CLOTHES THEY WEAR BUT JOI WAS A GLUG WITH A TWISTED MIND OF THE NASTY MEDITATIVE KIND
NOBODY MOVED WHO CARES FOR YOU SAID ALICE SHE HAD GROWN TO HER FULL SIZE BY THIS TIME YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A PACK OF CARDS AT THIS THE WHOLE PACK ROSE UP INTO THE AIR AND CAME FLYING DOWN UPON HER SHE GAVE A LITTLE SCREAM
YET ALL WERE FILLED WITH A VAGUE UNREST AS THEY CLIMBED THEIR TREES IN AN ENDLESS SEARCH BUT JOI THE FATHER HE MOCKED THEIR QUEST WHEN HE MARKED A GLUG ON HIS HARD WON PERCH SAID HE
WHY SUNLIGHT AND WORMS SAID THE LITTLE BLUE WREN SIX THE END OF JOI THEY CLIMBED THE TREES
STUFF AND NONSENSE SAID ALICE LOUDLY THE IDEA OF HAVING THE SENTENCE FIRST HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID THE QUEEN TURNING PURPLE I WON'T SAID ALICE OFF WITH HER HEAD
RODS POLES OR PERCHES DERIVED FROM GREEK OH THE HAWTHORN BUDS CAME OUT THIS WEEK AND ROBINS ARE NESTING DOWN BY THE CREEK SO SYM WAS HEAD OF HIS CLASS NOT ONCE AND HIS AUNT REPEATEDLY DUBBED HIM DUNCE BUT
SO THE GLUGS CONTINUED WITH GREED AND GLEE TO BUY CHEAP CLOTHING AND PILLS AND TEA TILL EVERY GLUG IN THE LAND OF GOSH OWNED THREE CLEAN SHIRTS AND A FOURTH IN THE WASH BUT THEY ALL GREW IDLE AND FOND OF EASE AND EASY TO SWINDLE AND HARD TO PLEASE
RULE FORTY TWO ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT EVERYBODY LOOKED AT ALICE I'M NOT A MILE HIGH SAID ALICE YOU ARE SAID THE KING NEARLY TWO MILES HIGH ADDED THE QUEEN
NOR YET DID THE GLUGS IN THEIR DREAMIEST DREAMS
HE OPENED HIS BOOK NO TAX SAID HE WHEREVER I LOOK THEN THEY FINED THE GLUG WITH THE PROMINENT EARS FOR BEING OLD FASHIONED BY SEVERAL YEARS AND THE OGS WENT HOME WITH THE STONES FULL STEAM DID YOU NOTICE THE SCHEME
AND FIND A PLEASURE IN ALL THEIR SIMPLE JOYS
WELL I SHAN'T GO AT ANY RATE SAID ALICE BESIDES THAT'S NOT A REGULAR RULE YOU INVENTED IT JUST NOW IT'S THE OLDEST RULE IN THE BOOK SAID THE KING
BUT ALL OF THE TALE THAT IS SO FAR TOLD HAS NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH THE OGS OF PODGE AND THEIR CRAFTY DODGE AND THE TRADE IN PICKLES AND GLUE TO TRADE WITH THE GLUGS CAME THE OGS TO GOSH AND THEY SAID IN SEDUCTIVE TONES
WHO CLIMBED A TREE WHEN THE WEATHER WAS CALM AND THEY HANGED POOR JOI ON A SNUFFLEBUST PALM THEN THEY SANG A PSALM DID THOSE PIOUS GLUGS NEATH THE SNUFFLEBUST PALM AND EVERY BEE THAT KISSES A FLOW'R
THERE'S NO NAME SIGNED AT THE END IF YOU DIDN'T SIGN IT SAID THE KING THAT ONLY MAKES THE MATTER WORSE YOU MUST HAVE MEANT SOME MISCHIEF
AND EVERY CLOUD THAT SAILS THE BLUE AND EVERY DANCING SUNBEAM TOO AND EVERY SPARKLING DEWDROP BRIGHT ALL KNOW THE GLUGS QUITE WELL BY SIGHT WE TELL SAY THEY
AND HIS NAME WAS SYM FAR FROM THE KEN OF THE GREAT KING SPLOSH AND SMALL WAS THE GLUGS REGARD OF HIM MOONING ALONG IN THE STREETS OF GOSH
READ THEM SAID THE KING THE WHITE RABBIT PUT ON HIS SPECTACLES WHERE SHALL I BEGIN PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY HE ASKED BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING THE KING SAID GRAVELY AND GO ON TILL YOU COME TO THE END THEN STOP
WHY WHAT A LONG SLEEP YOU'VE HAD OH I'VE HAD SUCH A CURIOUS DREAM SAID ALICE AND SHE TOLD HER SISTER AS WELL AS SHE COULD REMEMBER THEM
SAID HE WHENEVER THE WEST WIND STIRS AND BIRDS IN FEATHERS AND BEASTS IN FURS STEAL OUT TO DANCE IN THE GLADE LIE STILL
WHEN THE GREEN MOSS COVERS THOSE STONES YOU TREAD WHEN THE GREEN GRASS WHISPERS ABOVE MY HEAD MARK WELL WHEREVER YOUR PATH MAY TURN THEY HAVE REACHED THE VALLEY OF PEACE WHO LEARN THAT WISE HEARTS CHERISH WHAT FOOLS MAY SPURN
AND THERE CAME TO SYM AS HE WALKED AFIELD DEEP THOUGHTS OF THE WORLD AND THE FOLK OF GOSH
THE STONES OF GOSH NOW HERE IS A TALE OF THE GLUGS OF GOSH AND A WONDERFUL TALE I WEEN OF THE GLUGS OF GOSH AND THEIR GREAT KING SPLOSH AND TUSH HIS VIRTUOUS QUEEN
AND THINKING OF LITTLE ALICE AND ALL HER WONDERFUL ADVENTURES TILL SHE TOO BEGAN DREAMING
DON'T LET HIM KNOW SHE LIKED THEM BEST FOR THIS MUST EVER BE A SECRET KEPT FROM ALL THE REST BETWEEN YOURSELF AND ME THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF EVIDENCE WE'VE HEARD YET SAID THE KING RUBBING HIS HANDS
WHEN THE AUNT RECOVERED SHE SCREAMED A TRAMP A LOW LIVED PILFERING IDLE SCAMP WHO STEALS PEOPLE'S WASHING AND SLEEPS IN THE DAMP SHARP TO THE HOUR SYM WAS READY AND DRESSED YOUNG BIRDS SIGHED THE FATHER MUST GO FROM THE NEST
LET'S STAY ON THE GROUND AND KILL KING SPLOSH BUT SPLOSH THE KING
AND STOOPED TO A ROSE BUSH FLOWERING THERE SAID HE WHENEVER A BURSTING BLOOM LOOKS UP TO THE SUN MAY A SOUL FIND ROOM FOR A MEASURE OF AWE AT THE WONDROUS BIRTH OF ONE MORE TREASURE TO THIS GLAD EARTH SAID HE
UNLESS IT WAS WRITTEN TO NOBODY WHICH ISN'T USUAL YOU KNOW WHO IS IT DIRECTED TO SAID ONE OF THE JURYMEN IT ISN'T DIRECTED AT ALL SAID THE WHITE RABBIT IN FACT THERE'S NOTHING WRITTEN ON THE OUTSIDE
KNOW OF THEIR FOLLY WHO FEAR TO DIE NEW INTEREST CAME TO THE MIND OF SYM AS MIDST HIS FELLOWS HE LIVED AND TOILED BUT THE WAYS OF THE GLUG FOLK PUZZLED HIM FOR SOME WON HONOUR WHILE SOME WERE FOILED
BUT UNDER A HEDGE BY A FLOWERING PEACH A YOUTH WITH A LITTLE BLUE WREN HELD SPEECH WITH HIS BACK TO A TREE AND HIS FEET IN THE GRASS
THAT SHE WASN'T A BIT AFRAID OF INTERRUPTING HIM I'LL GIVE HIM SIXPENCE I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S AN ATOM OF MEANING IN IT THE JURY ALL WROTE DOWN ON THEIR SLATES SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE THERE'S AN ATOM OF MEANING IN IT BUT NONE OF THEM ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN THE PAPER
AND HERE IS A TALE OF THE CRAFTY OGS IN THEIR NEIGHBOURING LAND OF PODGE OF THEIR SAYINGS AND DOINGS AND PLOTTINGS AND BREWINGS AND SOMETHING ABOUT SIR STODGE WISE TO PROFUNDITY STOUT TO ROTUNDITY THAT WAS THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE
WHO SEEMED TOO MUCH OVERCOME TO DO ANYTHING BUT SIT WITH ITS MOUTH OPEN GAZING UP INTO THE ROOF OF THE COURT
THERE THEY ARE SAID THE KING TRIUMPHANTLY POINTING TO THE TARTS ON THE TABLE NOTHING CAN BE CLEARER THAN THAT THEN AGAIN
THE TRIAL CANNOT PROCEED SAID THE KING IN A VERY GRAVE VOICE UNTIL ALL THE JURYMEN ARE BACK IN THEIR PROPER PLACES ALL HE REPEATED WITH GREAT EMPHASIS LOOKING HARD AT ALICE
GIVE HIM A CHANCE SAID HIS FATHER JOI HIS HEAD IS ABNORMALLY LARGE FOR A BOY BUT HIS AUNT SAID PIFFIE IT'S CRAMMED WITH BOSH WHY HE DON'T KNOW THE RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS OF GOSH NOR THE NAMES OF THE NEPHEWS OF GOOD KING SPLOSH IN GOSH
SAID HIS AUNT LAWK A MUSSY WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE LAD HE ROMPS WITH THE PUPPIES AND TALKS TO THE ANTS AND KEEPS HIS LOOSE CHANGE IN HIS SECOND BEST PANTS AND STUMBLES ALL OVER MY CAULIFLOWER PLANTS THERE IS WISDOM IN THAT LAUGHED THE FATHER JOI
AND THE SNEEZE OF THE BABY THE SHRIEK OF THE GRYPHON AND ALL THE OTHER QUEER NOISES WOULD CHANGE SHE KNEW TO THE CONFUSED CLAMOUR OF THE BUSY FARM YARD WHILE THE LOWING OF THE CATTLE IN THE DISTANCE WOULD TAKE THE PLACE OF THE MOCK TURTLE'S HEAVY SOBS
THEY WERE JUST BEGINNING TO WRITE THIS DOWN ON THEIR SLATES WHEN THE WHITE RABBIT INTERRUPTED
I SEEM TO SEE SOME MEANING IN THEM AFTER ALL
WHY IT WAS SCREAMINGLY LAUGHABLE SEEMINGLY ASKING FOR NOTHING BUT STONES AND THE KING SAID HAW AND THE QUEEN SAID OH OUR DRAWING ROOM NOW IS A HEAVENLY SHOW OF LARGE OVERMANTELS AND WHATNOTS AND CHAIRS
DECLARED IT A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS LAND
SAID HE IF THE MIND OF A GLUG COULD WAKE THEN OH WHAT A WONDERFUL GLUG HE'D MAKE WE SHALL TEACH THIS LADDIE TO PLAY LIFE'S GAME WITH A DIFFERENT MIND AND A DEFINITE AIM A GLUG IN APPEARANCE YET NOT THE SAME
THE KING HASTILY SAID AND WENT ON TO HIMSELF IN AN UNDERTONE IMPORTANT UNIMPORTANT UNIMPORTANT IMPORTANT AS IF HE WERE TRYING WHICH WORD SOUNDED BEST SOME OF THE JURY WROTE IT DOWN IMPORTANT AND SOME UNIMPORTANT
THE LONG GRASS RUSTLED AT HER FEET AS THE WHITE RABBIT HURRIED BY THE FRIGHTENED MOUSE SPLASHED HIS WAY THROUGH THE NEIGHBOURING POOL SHE COULD HEAR THE RATTLE OF THE TEACUPS AS THE MARCH HARE AND HIS FRIENDS SHARED THEIR NEVER ENDING MEAL AND THE SHRILL VOICE OF THE QUEEN
AND SEE THAT QUEER LITTLE TOSS OF HER HEAD TO KEEP BACK THE WANDERING HAIR THAT WOULD ALWAYS GET INTO HER EYES AND STILL AS SHE LISTENED OR SEEMED TO LISTEN THE WHOLE PLACE AROUND HER BECAME ALIVE WITH THE STRANGE CREATURES OF HER LITTLE SISTER'S DREAM
YOU CAN'T SWIM CAN YOU HE ADDED TURNING TO THE KNAVE THE KNAVE SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY DO I LOOK LIKE IT HE SAID WHICH HE CERTAINLY DID NOT BEING MADE ENTIRELY OF CARDBOARD
WE'LL SELL YOU PIANERS AND PICKELS AND SPANNERS FOR SEVENTEEN SHIPLOADS OF STONES SMOOTH UNS OR NOBBLY UNS FIRM UNS OR WOBBLY UNS ALL WE ASK IS STONES
AND DARED TO MUSE ON THE ACTS OF SPLOSH
IF ANY ONE OF THEM CAN EXPLAIN IT SAID ALICE
FOR WHY THEY SAY IN THE LAND OF GOSH THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO WILL BOW TO SPLOSH AND THEY CLIMB THE TREES WHEN THE RAIN PELTS DOWN AND FEEDS THE GUTTERS THAT THREAD THE TOWN FOR THEY FEAR TO DROWN WHEN FLOODS ARE FROTHY AND WATERS BROWN
AND FREQUENTLY ASKED A DEPOSIT IN CASH THEN EVERY GLUG HE WENT HOME TO HIS REST WITH HIS HEAD IN A BAG AND HIS TOES TO THE WEST FOR THEY KNEW IT WAS BEST SINCE THEIR GRANDPAS SLEPT WITH THEIR TOES TO THE WEST
GODS OF THE GLOAMING WHO RIDE ON THE BREEZE STOOPING TO HEAFTEN THE BIRDS AND THE TREES BUT EACH DULL GLUG SITS DOWN BY HIS DOOR AND MUTTERS TIS WINDY AND NOTHING MORE LIKE THE LONG DEAD GLUGS IN THE DAYS OF YORE
AS SOON AS THE JURY HAD A LITTLE RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK OF BEING UPSET AND THEIR SLATES AND PENCILS HAD BEEN FOUND AND HANDED BACK TO THEM THEY SET TO WORK VERY DILIGENTLY TO WRITE OUT A HISTORY OF THE ACCIDENT ALL EXCEPT THE LIZARD
WHAT'S IN IT SAID THE QUEEN I HAVEN'T OPENED IT YET SAID THE WHITE RABBIT BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A LETTER WRITTEN BY THE PRISONER TO TO SOMEBODY
AND THEY TELL OF A PERFECTLY EASY WAY FOR YESTERDAY'S GLUG IS THE GLUG OF TO DAY AND THEY CLIMB THE TREES WHEN THE THUNDER ROLLS TO SOLEMNLY SALVE THEIR SHOP WORN SOULS FOR THEY FEAR THE COALS THAT THREATEN TO FRIZZLE THEIR SHOP WORN SOULS
IN THE FOLLOWING SUMMER THE OGS CAME BACK WITH A CARGO OF EIGHT DAY CLOCKS AND HAND PAINTED SCREENS AND SEWING MACHINES AND MANGLES AND SCISSORS AND SOCKS AND THEY SAID FOR THESE EXCELLENT THINGS WE BRING WE ARE READY TO TAKE MORE STONES
WHENEVER A DEWDROP CLINGS TO A GOSSAMER THREAD AND GLITTERS AND SWINGS DEEP IN HUMILITY BOW YOUR HEAD TO A THING FOR A BLUNDERING RNORTAL'S DREAD AND THERE CAME TO SYM IN HIS LATER YOUTH WITH THE FIRST CLEAR GLANCE IN THE FACE OF GUILE
AND ALL WOULD CHANGE TO DULL REALITY THE GRASS WOULD BE ONLY RUSTLING IN THE WIND AND THE POOL RIPPLING TO THE WAVING OF THE REEDS THE RATTLING TEACUPS WOULD CHANGE TO TINKLING SHEEP BELLS AND THE QUEEN'S SHRILL CRIES TO THE VOICE OF THE SHEPHERD BOY
AND THAT'S THE QUEEREST THING ABOUT IT THE JURY ALL LOOKED PUZZLED HE MUST HAVE IMITATED SOMEBODY ELSE'S HAND SAID THE KING THE JURY ALL BRIGHTENED UP AGAIN PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE KNAVE I DIDN'T WRITE IT AND THEY CAN'T PROVE I DID
HE WALKED IN THE WELCOMING FIELDS ALONE WHILE FROM FAR FAR AWAY CAME THE PEDAGOGUE'S DRONE IF A MAN MAKES MULTIPLY ABSTRACT NOUNS FROM B TAKE POPULATION OF TOWNS
AND TREATING FOES WITH THE CALM CONTEMPT OF THE ONE WHO KNOWS AND EVERY SPIDER WHO HEAVES A LINE AND TRUSTS TO HIS LUCK WHEN THE DAY IS FINE
FOR THAT GROCER OF OURS IN THE LIGHT BROWN HAT ASKS TWO AND ELEVEN FOR PICKLES LIKE THAT
HE KNOWS THE GLUGS QUITE WELL BY SIGHT YOU CAN NEVER MISTAKE THEM HE WILL SAY FOR THEY ALWAYS ACT IN A GLUGLIKE WAY AND THEY CLIMB THE TREES WHEN THE GLASS POINTS FAIR WITH CIRCUMSPECTION AND PROPER CARE
DO WE BLAME THE NIGHT WHEN DARKNESS GATHERS AND NONE CAN SEE SAID HE WHENEVER THERE SPRINGS FROM EARTH A PLANT ALL CROOKED AND MARRED AT BIRTH SHALL WE UNLEARNED IN THE GARDENER'S SCHEME BLAME PLANT OR EARTH FOR THE FAULTS THAT SEEM
THIS CLIMBING HABIT WAS OLD SO OLD THAT EVEN THE CHEESES COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHEN THE PAST GLUG PEOPLE FIRST BEGAN TO GIVE THEIR LIVES TO THE CLIMBING PLAN AND THE LEGEND RAN THAT THE ART WAS OLD AS THE MIND OF MAN AND EVEN THE MOUNTAINS OLD AND HOAR
WHERE I'VE HEARD IT REPORTED LARGE PROFITS ARE MADE BESIDES HE CAN SELL US CHEAP BUTTONS AND BRAID SO POOR YOUNG SYM HE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL WHERE THE FIRST THING TAUGHT IS THE GOLDEN RULE DO UNTO OTHERS THE TEACHER SAID
THE KING SAID TO ALICE NOTHING SAID ALICE NOTHING WHATEVER PERSISTED THE KING NOTHING WHATEVER SAID ALICE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THE KING SAID TURNING TO THE JURY
BUT THE PRACTICAL AUNT SAID FUDGE YOU FOOL WE'LL PACK UP HIS DINNER AND SEND HIM TO SCHOOL HE SHALL LEARN ABOUT TWO TIMES AND PARSING AND CAPES AND HOW TO MAKE MONEY WITH INCHES ON TAPES WE'LL APPRENTICE HIM THEN TO THE DRAPERY TRADE
HALF OF FRIGHT AND HALF OF ANGER AND TRIED TO BEAT THEM OFF AND FOUND HERSELF LYING ON THE BANK WITH HER HEAD IN THE LAP OF HER SISTER WHO WAS GENTLY BRUSHING AWAY SOME DEAD LEAVES THAT HAD FLUTTERED DOWN FROM THE TREES UPON HER FACE WAKE UP ALICE DEAR SAID HER SISTER
BUT THE GLUGS CRIED DOWN WITH SUCH MEDDLESOME FOOLS WHAT DID OUR GRANDPAS LAY DOWN IN THEIR RULES AND THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE HE OPENED HIS BOOK TO CHEAPNESS HE SAID WAS THE ROAD THEY TOOK
HE TRUSTS TO YOU TO SET THEM FREE EXACTLY AS WE WERE MY NOTION WAS THAT YOU HAD BEEN BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT AN OBSTACLE THAT CAME BETWEEN HIM AND OURSELVES AND IT
ALICE COULD SEE THIS AS SHE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO LOOK OVER THEIR SLATES BUT
AND EVERY BLOSSOM BORN FOR AN HOUR AND EVERY BIRD ON ITS GLADSOME FLIGHT ALL KNOW THE GLUGS QUITE WELL BY SIGHT FOR THEY SAY TIS A SIMPLE TEST WE'VE GOT IF YOU KNOW ONE GLUG WHY YOU KNOW THE LOT
THEN SUDDENLY STOPPED AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD YOU MAY LOOK UP THE REST IN A BOOK SAID HE AT PRESENT IT DOESN'T OCCUR TO ME BUT DO IT WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE AND NOW SAID THE TEACHER THE DAY'S TASK BRINGS CONSIDERATION OF PRACTICAL THINGS
THEN HE'D EMPLOY STERN MEASURES WITH SUCH LITTLE GIRL OR BOY BUT EVERY DAWN THAT PAINTS THE SKY AND EVERY SPLENDID NOONTIDE HIGH ALL KNOW THE GLUGS SO WELL SO WELL TIS AN EASY MATTER AND PLAIN TO TELL
IS IT MEET HE ASKED THAT A SOUL SHOULD CRAWL TO A PURPLE ROBE OR A GILDED CHAIR
OH I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE EXCLAIMED IN A TONE OF GREAT DISMAY AND BEGAN PICKING THEM UP AGAIN AS QUICKLY AS SHE COULD FOR THE ACCIDENT OF THE GOLDFISH KEPT RUNNING IN HER HEAD AND SHE HAD A VAGUE SORT OF IDEA THAT THEY MUST BE COLLECTED AT ONCE AND PUT BACK INTO THE JURY BOX OR THEY WOULD DIE
THEN SPLOSH THE KING ROSE UP AND SAID IT'S NOT POLITE BUT HE'S SAFER DEAD AND THERE'S NOT MUCH ROOM IN THE LAND OF GOSH FOR A GLUG NAMED JOI AND A KING CALLED SPLOSH AND EVERY GLUG FLUNG HIGH HIS HAT AND CRIED
WHENEVER THESE TALES ARE HEARD OF THE FEASIBLE DOG OR THE GUFFER BIRD THEN LAUGH AND LAUGH TILL THE FAT TEARS ROLL TO THE ROOTS OF THE JOY BUSH DEEP IN YOUR SOUL WHEN YOU SEE THEM SQUAT ON THE TREE TOPS HIGH SCANNING FOR EVER THAT HEEDLESS SKY
WE'RE GLUGS AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE THAT SO THEY CLIMBED THE TREES SINCE THE WEATHER WAS COLD WHILE THE BRAZEN BELL OF THE CITY TOLLED AND TOLLED AND TOLD THE FATE OF A GLUG WHO WAS OVER BOLD
AND THE CHOKING OF THE SUPPRESSED GUINEA PIGS FILLED THE AIR MIXED UP WITH THE DISTANT SOBS OF THE MISERABLE MOCK TURTLE SO SHE SAT ON WITH CLOSED EYES AND HALF BELIEVED HERSELF IN WONDERLAND THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE HAD BUT TO OPEN THEM AGAIN
IF THERE'S NO MEANING IN IT SAID THE KING THAT SAVES A WORLD OF TROUBLE YOU KNOW AS WE NEEDN'T TRY TO FIND ANY AND YET I DON'T KNOW HE WENT ON SPREADING OUT THE VERSES ON HIS KNEE
SHOUTS OF ANGER AND WORDS OF SHAME AS GLUG BLAMED GLUG FOR HIS WOEFUL STATE THIS BLAME SAID SYM IS IT MORTAL'S RIGHT TO BLAME HIS FELLOW FOR AUGHT HE BE
AND THE KING SAID HUM AND THE QUEEN SAID O O THAT CURTAIN WHAT A BEE OOTIFUL BLUE BUT A GLUG STOOD UP WITH SOME VERY LARGE EARS AND SAID
SAID ALICE THE KING TURNED PALE AND SHUT HIS NOTE BOOK HASTILY CONSIDER YOUR VERDICT HE SAID TO THE JURY IN A LOW TREMBLING VOICE THERE'S MORE EVIDENCE TO COME YET PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE WHITE RABBIT JUMPING UP IN A GREAT HURRY
AND A STATUE OF SPLOSH AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS BUT A GLUG STOOD UP WITH A CAST IN HIS EYE AND HE SAID FAR TOO MANY BAUBLES WE BUY WITH ALL THE GOSH FACTORIES CLOSING THEIR DOORS AND IMPORTERS WAREHOUSES LINING OUR SHORES
THESE WERE THE VERSES THE WHITE RABBIT READ THEY TOLD ME YOU HAD BEEN TO HER AND MENTIONED ME TO HIM SHE GAVE ME A GOOD CHARACTER BUT SAID I COULD NOT SWIM HE SENT THEM WORD I HAD NOT GONE WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE
AND THE OGS WENT HOME WITH THEIR LOADS OF STONES WHICH THEY LANDED WITH GLEE IN THE LAND OF PODGE DO YOU NOTICE THE DODGE NOT YET DID THE GLUGS NOR THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE
IF A MAN MAKES A PROFIT OF FIFTEEN POUNDS ON ONE WEEK'S TAKINGS FROM TWO MILK ROUNDS HOW MANY AND SYM WENT DREAMING AWAY TO THE SUNLIT LANDS WHERE THE FIELD MICE PLAY
AND KNOW WHAT THEY PROFIT WHO TRADE WITH HATE SAID HE WHENEVER THE GREAT SKIES SPREAD IN THE BECKONING VASTNESS OVERHEAD A TENT FOR THE BLUE WREN BUILDING A NEST THEN DOWN IN THE HEART OF YOU LEARN WHAT'S BEST
SO ALICE GOT UP AND RAN OFF THINKING WHILE SHE RAN AS WELL SHE MIGHT WHAT A WONDERFUL DREAM IT HAD BEEN BUT HER SISTER SAT STILL JUST AS SHE LEFT HER LEANING HER HEAD ON HER HAND
AND THE GLUGS WERE TICKLED WITH WHAT THEY'D DONE AND AFTER THAT IF A DAY SHOULD COME WHEN A GLUG FELT EXTRA SPECIALLY GLUM HE'D CALL HIS CHILDREN AROUND HIS KNEE AND TELL THAT TALE WITH A CHUCKLE OF GLEE AND SHOULD A LITTLE GLUG GIRL OR BOY SEE NAUGHT OF A JOKE IN THE FATE OF JOI
AND HIS PARENTS CLAIMS WERE A DEAL DENIED BY HIS MAIDEN AUNT ON HIS MOTHER'S SIDE
THEN EVERY GLUG WHO WAS NOT TOO FAT TURNED SEVENTEEN HANDSPRINGS AND JUMPED ON HIS HAT THEY FINED THE GLUG WITH THE CAST IN HIS EYE FOR LOOKING BOTH WAYS WHICH HE DID NOT DENY AND FOR HAVING NO VISIBLE PRECEDENT WHICH IS A CRIME IN THE POOR AND A FAULT IN THE RICH
THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THOUGHTS OF TRUTH OF GILDED BAUBLES AND THINGS WORTH WHILE AND HE SAID THERE IS MUCH THAT A GLUG SHOULD KNOW BUT HIS MIND IS CLOUDED HIS YEARS ARE FEW
THAT SHE TIPPED OVER THE JURY BOX WITH THE EDGE OF HER SKIRT UPSETTING ALL THE JURYMEN ON TO THE HEADS OF THE CROWD BELOW AND THERE THEY LAY SPRAWLING ABOUT
ALICE LOOKED AT THE JURY BOX AND SAW THAT IN HER HASTE
NOW TEACH ME LITTLE BLUE WREN SAID HE TIS YOU CAN UNRAVEL THIS RIDDLE FOR ME I AM MAZED BY THE GIFTS OF THIS KINDLY EARTH WHICH OF THEM ALL HAS THE GREATEST WORTH HE FLIRTED HIS TAIL AS HE ANSWERED THEN
ORDERING OFF HER UNFORTUNATE GUESTS TO EXECUTION ONCE MORE THE PIG BABY WAS SNEEZING ON THE DUCHESS'S KNEE WHILE PLATES AND DISHES CRASHED AROUND IT ONCE MORE THE SHRIEK OF THE GRYPHON THE SQUEAKING OF THE LIZARD'S SLATE PENCIL
SAID THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE AS HE OPENED HIS BOOK WHEN THE GOODS WERE CHEAP THEN THE GOODS WE TOOK SO THEY FINED THE GLUG WITH THE WART ON HIS NOSE FOR WEARING A WART WITH HIS EVERYDAY CLOTHES AND THE GOODS WERE BROUGHT HOME THRO A GLUG NAMED GHONES
AND THERE CAME TO THE WONDERING MIND OF HIM LONG THOUGHTS OF THE RIDDLE THAT VEXES YOUTH AND FATHER HE SAID IN THE MART'S LOUD DIN IS THERE AUGHT OF PLEASURE DO SOME FIND JOY BUT HIS FATHER TILTED THE BEARDLESS CHIN
FOR ANY OLD GLUG IS LIKE THE REST AND THEY CLIMB THE TREES WHEN THERE'S WEATHER ABOUT IN A GENERAL WAY AS A CURE FOR GOUT THO SOME FOLKS DOUBT IF THE CLIMBING HABIT IS GOOD FOR GOUT SO JOI WAS HANGED AND HIS RACE WAS RUN
LIE FLAT ON YOUR BACK ON THE GOOD GREEN EARTH AND ROAR TILL THE GREAT VAULT ECHOES YOUR MIRTH AS HE WALKED IN THE CITY TO SYM THERE CAME SOUNDS ENVENOMED WITH FEAR AND HATE
HER SISTER KISSED HER AND SAID IT WAS A CURIOUS DREAM DEAR CERTAINLY
BUT THE AUNT SAID TOITY AND DRAT THE BOY HE SHALL PLAY SAID THE FATHER SOME NOBLE PART WHO KNOWS BUT IT MAY BE IN LETTERS OR ART TIS A DIGNIFIED BUSINESS TO MAKE FOLK THINK BUT THE AUNT CRIED WHAT GO MESSING WITH INK AND SMEAR ALL HIS FINGERS AND TAKE TO DRINK
WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU I GAVE HER ONE THEY GAVE HIM TWO YOU GAVE US THREE OR MORE THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU THOUGH THEY WERE MINE BEFORE IF I OR SHE SHOULD CHANCE TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AFFAIR
BUT FOLK NOT PREJUDICED SAW THE GLUG AS HIS NURSE REMARKED IN THE CUT OF HIS MUG FOR HE HAD THEIR HAIR AND HE HAD THEIR EYES AND THE GLUG EXPRESSION OF PAINED SURPRISE AND THEIR PREDILECTION FOR PUMPKIN PIES
SO SAYING MY UNCLE TOOK IN ONE HAND RUHMKORFF'S APPARATUS WHICH WAS HANGING FROM HIS NECK AND WITH THE OTHER HE FORMED AN ELECTRIC COMMUNICATION WITH THE COIL IN THE LANTERN AND A SUFFICIENTLY BRIGHT LIGHT DISPERSED THE DARKNESS OF THE PASSAGE
AND FOUR HUNDRED FEET LONG FIRST HE DROPPED HALF OF IT DOWN THEN HE PASSED IT ROUND A LAVA BLOCK THAT PROJECTED CONVENIENTLY AND THREW THE OTHER HALF DOWN THE CHIMNEY EACH OF US COULD THEN DESCEND BY HOLDING WITH THE HAND BOTH HALVES OF THE ROPE
ABOUT EIGHT IN THE EVENING HE SIGNALLED TO STOP HANS SAT DOWN AT ONCE THE LAMPS WERE HUNG UPON A PROJECTION IN THE LAVA WE WERE IN A SORT OF CAVERN WHERE THERE WAS PLENTY OF AIR CERTAIN PUFFS OF AIR REACHED US
CRIED THE PROFESSOR AND SHARING HIS ASTONISHMENT BUT I THINK NOT HIS JOY I READ ON THE WESTERN FACE OF THE BLOCK IN RUNIC CHARACTERS HALF MOULDERED AWAY WITH LAPSE OF AGES
LEANING OVER THE EDGE OF OUR NARROW STANDING GROUND I OBSERVED THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE WAS STILL INVISIBLE THE SAME MANOEUVRE WAS REPEATED WITH THE CORD AND HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE HAD DESCENDED ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED FEET
THE SUPREME HOUR HAD COME I MIGHT NOW EITHER SHARE IN THE ENTERPRISE OR REFUSE TO MOVE FORWARD BUT I WAS ASHAMED TO RECOIL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HUNTER HANS ACCEPTED THE ENTERPRISE WITH SUCH CALMNESS SUCH INDIFFERENCE
WHICH I KNEW THAT WE HAD REPEATED FOURTEEN TIMES EACH DESCENT OCCUPYING HALF AN HOUR THE CONCLUSION WAS EASY THAT WE HAD BEEN SEVEN HOURS PLUS FOURTEEN QUARTERS OF REST MAKING TEN HOURS AND A HALF WE HAD STARTED AT ONE IT MUST THEREFORE NOW BE ELEVEN O'CLOCK
CHAPTER SIXTEEN BOLDLY DOWN THE CRATER
NO VARIATION ALWAYS THE SAME CONCLUSION
I STOPPED SHORT JUST AS I WAS GOING TO PLACE MY FEET UPON MY UNCLE'S HEAD
THIS GAVE REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT OUR DESCENT WAS MORE HORIZONTAL THAN VERTICAL AS FOR THE EXACT DEPTH REACHED IT WAS VERY EASY TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE PROFESSOR MEASURED ACCURATELY THE ANGLES OF DEVIATION AND INCLINATION ON THE ROAD BUT HE KEPT THE RESULTS TO HIMSELF
BUT SAID I THE CLOTHES AND THAT MASS OF LADDERS AND ROPES WHAT IS TO BECOME OF THEM
THEN THE RAT SAT ON HIM AND THE MOLE GOT HIS MOTOR CLOTHES OFF HIM BIT BY BIT AND THEY STOOD HIM UP ON HIS LEGS AGAIN A GOOD DEAL OF HIS BLUSTERING SPIRIT SEEMED TO HAVE EVAPORATED WITH THE REMOVAL OF HIS FINE PANOPLY
MY UNCLE'S RAGE KNEW NO BOUNDS IT WAS ENOUGH TO IRRITATE A MEEKER MAN THAN HE FOR IT WAS FOUNDERING ALMOST WITHIN THE PORT BUT HEAVEN NEVER SENDS UNMIXED GRIEF
BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GUIDE I HELD MY PEACE MY HEART FLEW BACK TO MY SWEET VIRLANDAISE AND I APPROACHED THE CENTRAL CHIMNEY I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT IT WAS A HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER AND THREE HUNDRED FEET ROUND
AND PRESENTLY THEY NOTICED THAT THE SERMON BEGAN TO BE PUNCTUATED AT INTERVALS BY LONG DRAWN SOBS EVIDENTLY PROCEEDING FROM THE BOSOM OF TOAD WHO WAS A SOFT HEARTED AND AFFECTIONATE FELLOW VERY EASILY CONVERTED FOR THE TIME BEING TO ANY POINT OF VIEW
IN FACT THE MERCURY WHICH HAD RISEN IN THE INSTRUMENT AS FAST AS WE DESCENDED HAD STOPPED AT TWENTY NINE INCHES YOU SEE SAID THE PROFESSOR
YOU'VE OFTEN ASKED US THREE TO COME AND STAY WITH YOU TOAD IN THIS HANDSOME HOUSE OF YOURS WELL NOW WE'RE GOING TO WHEN WE'VE CONVERTED YOU TO A PROPER POINT OF VIEW WE MAY QUIT BUT NOT BEFORE TAKE HIM UPSTAIRS YOU TWO AND LOCK HIM UP IN HIS BEDROOM
GREENLAND SAID HE GREENLAND I CRIED YES
ARE CARRIED EVEN INTO ICELAND
WHEN LYING ON MY BACK I OPENED MY EYES AND SAW A BRIGHT SPARKLING POINT OF LIGHT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE GIGANTIC TUBE THREE THOUSAND FEET LONG NOW A VAST TELESCOPE IT WAS A STAR WHICH SEEN FROM THIS DEPTH
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE WONDERS OF TERRESTRIAL DEPTHS AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING A RAY OF DAYLIGHT CAME TO WAKE US UP THE THOUSAND SHINING SURFACES OF LAVA ON THE WALLS RECEIVED IT ON ITS PASSAGE AND SCATTERED IT LIKE A SHOWER OF SPARKS
AND DURING THAWS THE WHITE BEARS
LET US THEREFORE ASSUME THIS LAST HYPOTHESIS AS THE MOST SUITABLE TO OUR SITUATION AND CALCULATE
MY UNCLE TURNED TOO AND FOLLOWED IT AT NOON BEING AT ITS LEAST EXTENT IT CAME AND SOFTLY FELL UPON THE EDGE OF THE MIDDLE CHIMNEY THERE IT IS
HERE WE ARE AT THE TOP OF SNAEFELL AND HERE ARE TWO PEAKS
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAVE MADE NO GREAT PROGRESS VERTICALLY WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT
HAD LOST ALL SCINTILLATION AND WHICH BY MY COMPUTATION SHOULD BE FORTY SIX URSA MINOR
IN ORDER THAT ANY MAN WHO MISSED HIS FOOTING MIGHT BE HELD UP BY HIS COMPANIONS THIS SOLID FORMATION WAS PRUDENT BUT DID NOT REMOVE ALL DANGER YET NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE DESCENT DOWN STEEPS UNKNOWN TO THE GUIDE
BUT NO I SAW HIM WITH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED AND LEGS STRADDLING WIDE APART ERECT BEFORE A GRANITE ROCK THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE CRATER JUST LIKE A PEDESTAL MADE READY TO RECEIVE A STATUE OF PLUTO
HE MUST NEVER BE LEFT AN INSTANT UNGUARDED WE SHALL HAVE TO TAKE IT IN TURNS TO BE WITH HIM TILL THE POISON HAS WORKED ITSELF OUT OF HIS SYSTEM THEY ARRANGED WATCHES ACCORDINGLY
LIKE A MERE CONTINUATION OF THOSE FLOCK LIKE SUMMITS THE EYE COULD HARDLY TELL WHERE THE SNOWY RIDGES ENDED AND THE FOAMING WAVES BEGAN I WAS THUS STEEPED IN THE MARVELLOUS ECSTASY WHICH ALL HIGH SUMMITS DEVELOP IN THE MIND
AT THIS POINT A RUNIC TEXT APPEARS
I DEMAND AN INSTANT EXPLANATION TAKE THEM OFF HIM THEN YOU TWO ORDERED THE BADGER BRIEFLY THEY HAD TO LAY TOAD OUT ON THE FLOOR KICKING AND CALLING ALL SORTS OF NAMES BEFORE THEY COULD GET TO WORK PROPERLY
MY HAIR STOOD ON END WITH TERROR THE BEWILDERING FEELING OF VACUITY LAID HOLD UPON ME I FELT MY CENTRE OF GRAVITY SHIFTING ITS PLACE AND GIDDINESS MOUNTING INTO MY BRAIN LIKE DRUNKENNESS
I THEN REMEMBERED THAT WE HAD SEARCHED FOR IT IN VAIN THE EVENING BEFORE MY UNCLE QUESTIONED HANS WHO AFTER HAVING EXAMINED ATTENTIVELY WITH THE EYE OF A HUNTSMAN REPLIED
BUT I WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE REALITIES OF THINGS BY THE ARRIVAL OF HANS AND THE PROFESSOR WHO JOINED ME ON THE SUMMIT MY UNCLE POINTED OUT TO ME IN THE FAR WEST A LIGHT STEAM OR MIST A SEMBLANCE OF LAND WHICH BOUNDED THE DISTANT HORIZON OF WATERS
CARBONIFEROUS DEVONIAN SILURIAN OR PRIMITIVE WAS ALL ONE TO ME BUT THE PROFESSOR NO DOUBT WAS PURSUING HIS OBSERVATIONS OR TAKING NOTES FOR IN ONE OF OUR HALTS HE SAID TO ME THE FARTHER I GO THE MORE CONFIDENCE I FEEL
THEY SET OFF UP THE ROAD ON THEIR MISSION OF MERCY BADGER LEADING THE WAY ANIMALS WHEN IN COMPANY WALK IN A PROPER AND SENSIBLE MANNER IN SINGLE FILE INSTEAD OF SPRAWLING ALL ACROSS THE ROAD AND BEING OF NO USE OR SUPPORT TO EACH OTHER IN CASE OF SUDDEN TROUBLE OR DANGER
HE WAS LOOKING VERY HARD AT TOAD AS HE SAID THIS AND COULD NOT HELP THINKING HE PERCEIVED SOMETHING VAGUELY RESEMBLING A TWINKLE IN THAT ANIMAL'S STILL SORROWFUL EYE THERE'S ONLY ONE THING MORE TO BE DONE CONTINUED THE GRATIFIED BADGER TOAD
IT WAS A BRIGHT MORNING IN THE EARLY PART OF SUMMER THE RIVER HAD RESUMED ITS WONTED BANKS AND ITS ACCUSTOMED PACE AND A HOT SUN SEEMED TO BE PULLING EVERYTHING GREEN AND BUSHY AND SPIKY UP OUT OF THE EARTH TOWARDS HIM AS IF BY STRINGS
IS THAT POSSIBLE YES OR FIGURES ARE OF NO USE THE PROFESSOR'S CALCULATIONS WERE QUITE CORRECT
AND FOR PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK THERE WAS A SATISFACTION IN STORE PROPORTIONED TO HIS DESPERATE ANXIETIES
THIS CORD SEEMED A FRAGILE THING FOR THREE PERSONS TO BE SUSPENDED FROM I MADE AS LITTLE USE OF IT AS POSSIBLE PERFORMING WONDERFUL FEATS OF EQUILIBRIUM UPON THE LAVA PROJECTIONS WHICH MY FOOT SEEMED TO CATCH HOLD OF LIKE A HAND
BY AN OPTICAL LAW WHICH OBTAINS AT ALL GREAT HEIGHTS THE SHORES SEEMED RAISED AND THE CENTRE DEPRESSED IT SEEMED AS IF ONE OF HELBESMER'S RAISED MAPS LAY AT MY FEET
MORE THAN THAT I AM ANXIOUS ABOUT IT WE HAVE ONLY WATER ENOUGH FOR FIVE DAYS
THE SHADOW PROJECTED FROM WHICH ON A CERTAIN DAY WOULD POINT OUT THE ROAD TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH NOW NO SUN NO SHADOW AND THEREFORE NO GUIDE HERE WAS JUNE TWENTY FIFTH
WHAT ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WAS THE CAUSE OF THEM I COULD NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION AT THE MOMENT HUNGER AND FATIGUE MADE ME INCAPABLE OF REASONING A DESCENT OF SEVEN HOURS CONSECUTIVELY IS NOT MADE WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE EXPENDITURE OF STRENGTH I WAS EXHAUSTED
MY SILENCE WAS TAKEN FOR CONSENT AND THE DESCENT WENT ON ANOTHER THREE HOURS AND I SAW NO BOTTOM TO THE CHIMNEY YET WHEN I LIFTED MY HEAD I PERCEIVED THE GRADUAL CONTRACTION OF ITS APERTURE ITS WALLS BY A GENTLE INCLINE WERE DRAWING CLOSER TO EACH OTHER
I RAISED MY HEAD AND SAW FOR THE LAST TIME THROUGH THE LENGTH OF THAT VAST TUBE THE SKY OF ICELAND WHICH I WAS NEVER TO BEHOLD AGAIN THE LAVA IN THE LAST ERUPTION OF TWELVE TWENTY NINE HAD FORCED A PASSAGE THROUGH THIS TUNNEL
DO CALCULATE MY BOY NOTHING IS EASIER SAID I PUTTING DOWN FIGURES IN MY NOTE BOOK NINE TIMES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET GIVES A DEPTH OF ELEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET VERY ACCURATE INDEED WELL
I SOON FOUND OUT THE CAUSE AND HOPE DAWNED AGAIN IN MY HEART FOR THIS REASON OF THE THREE WAYS OPEN BEFORE US ONE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY SAKNUSSEMM THE INDICATIONS OF THE LEARNED ICELANDER HINTED AT IN THE CRYPTOGRAM
MY UNCLE RECKONED UPON A FRESH SUPPLY FROM SUBTERRANEAN SOURCES BUT HITHERTO WE HAD MET WITH NONE I COULD NOT HELP DRAWING HIS ATTENTION TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE
EACH OF US WILL STRAP ONE UPON HIS BACK I MEAN ONLY FRAGILE ARTICLES OF COURSE WE WERE NOT INCLUDED UNDER THAT HEAD HANS SAID HE
SUCH PERFECT DISREGARD OF ANY POSSIBLE DANGER THAT I BLUSHED AT THE IDEA OF BEING LESS BRAVE THAN HE
NOW IT IS OUR TURN NOW I ASK ANY SENSIBLE MAN IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HEAR THOSE WORDS WITHOUT A SHUDDER THE PROFESSOR FASTENED HIS PACKAGE OF INSTRUMENTS UPON HIS SHOULDERS HANS TOOK THE TOOLS I TOOK THE ARMS
I DON'T SUPPOSE THE MADDEST GEOLOGIST UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE STUDIED THE NATURE OF THE ROCKS THAT WE WERE PASSING I AM SURE I DID TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT THEM
YOU'VE GONE ON SQUANDERING THE MONEY YOUR FATHER LEFT YOU AND YOU'RE GETTING US ANIMALS A BAD NAME IN THE DISTRICT BY YOUR FURIOUS DRIVING AND YOUR SMASHES AND YOUR ROWS WITH THE POLICE
AND SENT THEM BODILY DOWN THE GULF BEFORE US I LISTENED TO THE DULL THUDS OF THE DESCENDING BALE MY UNCLE LEANING OVER THE ABYSS FOLLOWED THE DESCENT OF THE LUGGAGE WITH A SATISFIED NOD AND ONLY ROSE ERECT WHEN HE HAD QUITE LOST SIGHT OF IT
SO THAT THE GENTLE SLOPE ALLOWED ITS LOWER BRIM TO BE REACHED WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY INVOLUNTARILY I COMPARED THE WHOLE CRATER TO AN ENORMOUS ERECTED MORTAR AND THE COMPARISON PUT ME IN A TERRIBLE FRIGHT WHAT MADNESS I THOUGHT
AND THE DESCENT COMMENCED IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER HANS MY UNCLE AND MYSELF IT WAS EFFECTED IN PROFOUND SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE DESCENT OF LOOSENED STONES DOWN THE DARK GULF
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO DROP DOWN WHEN A HAND LAID HOLD OF ME IT WAS THAT OF HANS
INTENDED FOR SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS HE CONSULTED HIS INSTRUMENTS AND RECORDED
THEY REACHED THE CARRIAGE DRIVE OF TOAD HALL TO FIND AS THE BADGER HAD ANTICIPATED A SHINY NEW MOTOR CAR OF GREAT SIZE
ADDED THE MOLE TURNING THE KEY ON HIM THEY DESCENDED THE STAIR TOAD SHOUTING ABUSE AT THEM THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AND THE THREE FRIENDS THEN MET IN CONFERENCE ON THE SITUATION IT'S GOING TO BE A TEDIOUS BUSINESS SAID THE BADGER SIGHING
HANS BUILT A HUT OF PIECES OF LAVA I FELT A MALICIOUS PLEASURE IN WATCHING THE THOUSAND RILLS AND CASCADES THAT CAME TUMBLING DOWN THE SIDES OF THE CONE
I DROPPED AS IT WERE FRANTICALLY CLUTCHING THE DOUBLE CORD WITH ONE HAND AND BUTTRESSING MYSELF FROM THE WALL WITH THE OTHER BY MEANS OF MY STICK ONE IDEA OVERPOWERED ME ALMOST FEAR LEST THE ROCK SHOULD GIVE WAY FROM WHICH I WAS HANGING
I'VE NEVER SEEN TOAD SO DETERMINED
YOU KNEW IT MUST COME TO THIS SOONER OR LATER TOAD THE BADGER EXPLAINED SEVERELY YOU'VE DISREGARDED ALL THE WARNINGS WE'VE GIVEN YOU
SEATED UPON LOOSE LAVA ROCKS LOOKED AT HIM WITH AS MUCH WONDER AS THEY KNEW HOW TO EXPRESS AND PERHAPS TAKING HIM FOR AN ESCAPED LUNATIC SUDDENLY MY UNCLE UTTERED A CRY I THOUGHT HIS FOOT MUST HAVE SLIPPED AND THAT HE HAD FALLEN DOWN ONE OF THE HOLES
TO GO DOWN INTO A MORTAR PERHAPS A LOADED MORTAR TO BE SHOT UP INTO THE AIR AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
THERE IS SOMETHING ALARMING IN THE QUIETNESS ITSELF NOW COME MY UNCLE CRIED IF YOU ARE FRIGHTENED ALREADY
EACH SHOULDERED HIS PACKAGE HANS DROVE BEFORE HIM THE LOAD OF CORDS AND CLOTHES
I REPUDIATE THE NOTION OF CENTRAL HEAT ALTOGETHER
THE NEXT MORNING A GREY HEAVY CLOUDY SKY SEEMED TO DROOP OVER THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE I DID NOT KNOW THIS FIRST FROM THE APPEARANCES OF NATURE BUT I FOUND IT OUT BY MY UNCLE'S IMPETUOUS WRATH
TOAD LOOKED DESPERATELY THIS WAY AND THAT WHILE THE OTHER ANIMALS WAITED IN GRAVE SILENCE AT LAST HE SPOKE NO HE SAID A LITTLE SULLENLY BUT STOUTLY I'M NOT SORRY AND IT WASN'T FOLLY AT ALL IT WAS SIMPLY GLORIOUS
NO CRIES OF BASKET WOMEN NO BOATMEN SHOUTING
AND IT WAS BEGINNING TO GROW DARKER STILL WE KEPT DESCENDING IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE FALLING STONES WERE MEETING WITH AN EARLIER RESISTANCE AND THAT THE CONCUSSION GAVE A MORE ABRUPT AND DEADENED SOUND
ACCORDING TO YOUR SYSTEM SAID MY UNCLE
THIS IS MY CONCLUSION ACCORDING TO EXACT OBSERVATIONS THE INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE IN THE INTERIOR OF THE GLOBE ADVANCES AT THE RATE OF ONE DEGREE
OR ELSE HUNTED UP IN HIS OWN HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOOD WHICH WAS A SERIOUS UNDERTAKING THE BADGER STRODE HEAVILY INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD LOOKING AT THE TWO ANIMALS WITH AN EXPRESSION FULL OF SERIOUSNESS THE RAT LET HIS EGG SPOON FALL ON THE TABLE CLOTH AND SAT OPEN MOUTHED
ANOTHER NEW AND EXCEPTIONALLY POWERFUL MOTOR CAR WILL ARRIVE AT TOAD HALL ON APPROVAL OR RETURN AT THIS VERY MOMENT PERHAPS TOAD IS BUSY ARRAYING HIMSELF IN THOSE SINGULARLY HIDEOUS HABILIMENTS SO DEAR TO HIM
THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO DISTINGUISH SURROUNDING OBJECTS WELL AXEL WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT CRIED MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS DID YOU EVER SPEND A QUIETER NIGHT IN OUR LITTLE HOUSE AT KOENIGSBERG
IT STILL LINED THE WALLS WITH A THICK AND GLISTENING COAT THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WAS HERE INTENSIFIED A HUNDREDFOLD BY REFLECTION THE ONLY DIFFICULTY IN PROCEEDING LAY IN NOT SLIDING TOO FAST DOWN AN INCLINE OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE DEGREES
POINTED TO THIS FACT THAT THE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS CAME TO TOUCH THAT PARTICULAR WAY DURING THE LATTER DAYS OF THE MONTH OF JUNE THAT SHARP PEAK MIGHT HENCE BE CONSIDERED AS THE GNOMON OF A VAST SUN DIAL
IF THE SUN WAS CLOUDED FOR SIX DAYS WE MUST POSTPONE OUR VISIT TILL NEXT YEAR MY LIMITED POWERS OF DESCRIPTION WOULD FAIL WERE I TO ATTEMPT A PICTURE OF THE PROFESSOR'S ANGRY IMPATIENCE
WE WILL SEE ABOUT THAT TO MORROW LET US HAVE OUR SUPPER AND GO TO SLEEP THE DARKNESS WAS NOT YET COMPLETE THE PROVISION CASE WAS OPENED WE REFRESHED OURSELVES AND WENT TO SLEEP AS WELL AS WE COULD UPON A BED OF STONES AND LAVA FRAGMENTS
HANS AND THE ICELANDERS NEVER STIRRED
THE FANCIFUL CREATION OF SCANDINAVIAN SUPERSTITIONS I FELT INTOXICATED WITH THE SUBLIME PLEASURE OF LOFTY ELEVATIONS WITHOUT THINKING OF THE PROFOUND ABYSSES INTO WHICH I WAS SHORTLY TO BE PLUNGED
VERY WELL THEN SAID THE BADGER FIRMLY RISING TO HIS FEET SINCE YOU WON'T YIELD TO PERSUASION WE'LL TRY WHAT FORCE CAN DO I FEARED IT WOULD COME TO THIS ALL ALONG
YOU TWO ANIMALS WILL ACCOMPANY ME INSTANTLY TO TOAD HALL AND THE WORK OF RESCUE SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED RIGHT YOU ARE CRIED THE RAT STARTING UP WE'LL RESCUE THE POOR UNHAPPY ANIMAL WE'LL CONVERT HIM
HANS CARRIED THE OTHER APPARATUS WHICH WAS ALSO PUT INTO ACTION THIS INGENIOUS APPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY WOULD ENABLE US TO GO ON FOR A LONG TIME BY CREATING AN ARTIFICIAL LIGHT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INFLAMMABLE GASES NOW MARCH CRIED MY UNCLE
WE'LL TEACH HIM TO BE A SENSIBLE TOAD THIS VERY MORNING CONTINUED THE BADGER TAKING AN ARM CHAIR AS I LEARNT LAST NIGHT FROM A TRUSTWORTHY SOURCE
I'D HAVE SAID ANYTHING IN THERE YOU'RE SO ELOQUENT DEAR BADGER AND SO MOVING AND SO CONVINCING AND PUT ALL YOUR POINTS SO FRIGHTFULLY WELL YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH ME IN THERE AND YOU KNOW IT BUT I'VE BEEN SEARCHING MY MIND SINCE AND GOING OVER THINGS IN IT
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS THEY NEARED THE DOOR IT WAS FLUNG OPEN AND MISTER TOAD ARRAYED IN GOGGLES CAP GAITERS AND ENORMOUS OVERCOAT CAME SWAGGERING DOWN THE STEPS DRAWING ON HIS GAUNTLETED GLOVES HULLO
COME ON YOU FELLOWS HE CRIED CHEERFULLY ON CATCHING SIGHT OF THEM YOU'RE JUST IN TIME TO COME WITH ME FOR A JOLLY TO COME FOR A JOLLY FOR A ER JOLLY
MOREOVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO THROUGH GNEISS
I SAID I WOULD TAKE HIM IN HAND AS SOON AS THE WINTER WAS WELL OVER AND I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM IN HAND TO DAY TOAD'S HOUR OF COURSE CRIED THE MOLE DELIGHTEDLY HOORAY
PRECIPICES LIKE LOW WALLS LAKES REDUCED TO PONDS RIVERS ABBREVIATED INTO STREAMS ON MY RIGHT WERE NUMBERLESS GLACIERS AND INNUMERABLE PEAKS SOME PLUMED WITH FEATHERY CLOUDS OF SMOKE
THE BED WAS HARD THE SHELTER NOT VERY SUBSTANTIAL
ITS DEPTH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET IMAGINE THE ASPECT OF SUCH A RESERVOIR BRIM FULL AND RUNNING OVER WITH LIQUID FIRE AMID THE ROLLING THUNDER THE BOTTOM OF THE FUNNEL WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FEET IN CIRCUIT
WHEN ONE OF THESE SLIPPERY STEPS SHOOK UNDER THE HEAVIER FORM OF HANS HE SAID IN HIS TRANQUIL VOICE
WHAT CRIED THE BADGER GREATLY SCANDALISED YOU BACKSLIDING ANIMAL
THIS WAS A WONDERFUL THING INDEED THAT THE BADGER SHOULD PAY A FORMAL CALL ON THEM OR INDEED ON ANYBODY HE GENERALLY HAD TO BE CAUGHT IF YOU WANTED HIM BADLY AS HE SLIPPED QUIETLY ALONG A HEDGEROW OF AN EARLY MORNING OR A LATE EVENING
THAT ON RAISING MY HEAD AGAIN I SAW ONLY MY UNCLE AND HANS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER THE ICELANDERS HAD BEEN DISMISSED
SUCH AS THE MINES OF KITZ BAHL IN TYROL AND THOSE OF WUTTEMBOURG IN BOHEMIA
AND I FIND THAT I'M NOT A BIT SORRY OR REPENTANT REALLY SO IT'S NO EARTHLY GOOD SAYING I AM NOW IS IT THEN YOU DON'T PROMISE SAID THE BADGER NEVER TO TOUCH A MOTOR CAR AGAIN CERTAINLY NOT REPLIED TOAD EMPHATICALLY ON THE CONTRARY
HAPPILY CERTAIN ASPERITIES AND A FEW BLISTERINGS HERE AND THERE FORMED STEPS AND WE DESCENDED LETTING OUR BAGGAGE SLIP BEFORE US FROM THE END OF A LONG ROPE BUT THAT WHICH FORMED STEPS UNDER OUR FEET BECAME STALACTITES OVERHEAD
THE QUESTION BEING PUT HANS REPLIED SCARTARIS MY UNCLE SHOT A TRIUMPHANT GLANCE AT ME NOW FOR THE CRATER HE CRIED THE CRATER OF SNAEFELL RESEMBLED AN INVERTED CONE THE OPENING OF WHICH MIGHT BE HALF A LEAGUE IN DIAMETER
SOUNDING HIS WAY WITH HIS IRON POINTED POLE TO DISCOVER ANY CREVASSES IN IT
AND SO IT WAS THE BUNDLE HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY A PROJECTION A HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US IMMEDIATELY THE ICELANDER CLIMBED UP LIKE A CAT AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE PACKAGE WAS IN OUR POSSESSION NOW SAID MY UNCLE LET US BREAKFAST
IT IS MAGNIFICENT I CRIED SPONTANEOUSLY MY UNCLE WHAT A SIGHT DON'T YOU ADMIRE THOSE BLENDING HUES OF LAVA PASSING FROM REDDISH BROWN TO BRIGHT YELLOW BY IMPERCEPTIBLE SHADES AND THESE CRYSTALS ARE JUST LIKE GLOBES OF LIGHT
HE TOOK TOAD FIRMLY BY THE ARM LED HIM INTO THE SMOKING ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM THAT'S NO GOOD SAID THE RAT CONTEMPTUOUSLY
NOW THAT HE WAS MERELY TOAD AND NO LONGER THE TERROR OF THE HIGHWAY HE GIGGLED FEEBLY AND LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER APPEALINGLY
THEN AS TOAD WAS HUSTLED THROUGH THE DOOR STRUGGLING AND PROTESTING HE TURNED TO THE CHAUFFEUR IN CHARGE OF THE NEW MOTOR CAR I'M AFRAID YOU WON'T BE WANTED TO DAY HE SAID MISTER TOAD HAS CHANGED HIS MIND
I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO LOOK DOWN EITHER OF THEM BUT PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK HAD HASTILY SURVEYED ALL THREE HE WAS PANTING RUNNING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER GESTICULATING AND UTTERING INCOHERENT EXPRESSIONS HANS AND HIS COMRADES
HANS SLEPT PEACEABLY AT THE FOOT OF A ROCK IN A LAVA BED WHERE HE HAD FOUND A SUITABLE COUCH FOR HIMSELF BUT MY UNCLE WAS PACING AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE I HAD NEITHER THE WISH NOR THE STRENGTH TO RISE
RUSHED BOUNDING DOWN THE ABYSS AND IN THEIR FALL AWOKE ECHOES REMARKABLE FOR THEIR LOUD AND WELL DEFINED SHARPNESS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CONE THERE WERE GLACIERS HERE HANS ADVANCED ONLY WITH EXTREME PRECAUTION
WHILE WE ARRANGE MATTERS BETWEEN OURSELVES IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD TOADY YOU KNOW SAID THE RAT KINDLY AS TOAD KICKING AND STRUGGLING WAS HAULED UP THE STAIRS BY HIS TWO FAITHFUL FRIENDS
I ROSE FROM MY GRANITE BED AND WENT OUT TO ENJOY THE MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE THAT LAY UNROLLED BEFORE ME I STOOD ON THE VERY SUMMIT OF THE SOUTHERNMOST OF SNAEFELL'S PEAKS THE RANGE OF THE EYE EXTENDED OVER THE WHOLE ISLAND
HOW SO I ASKED YOU WILL SEE PRESENTLY MY UNCLE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO EMPLOY MAGNIFICENT RESOURCES OBEYING ORDERS HANS TIED ALL THE NON FRAGILE ARTICLES IN ONE BUNDLE CORDED THEM FIRMLY
THE ORDER TO HALT THEREFORE GAVE ME PLEASURE HANS LAID OUR PROVISIONS UPON A BLOCK OF LAVA AND WE ATE WITH A GOOD APPETITE BUT ONE THING TROUBLED ME OUR SUPPLY OF WATER WAS HALF CONSUMED
I RAISED MY HEAD AND SAW STRAIGHT ABOVE ME THE UPPER APERTURE OF THE CONE FRAMING A BIT OF SKY OF VERY SMALL CIRCUMFERENCE BUT ALMOST PERFECTLY ROUND
BUT WE MUST LAY IN A GOOD STOCK FOR WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE MAY HAVE TO GO ON THE BISCUIT AND EXTRACT OF MEAT WERE WASHED DOWN WITH A DRAUGHT OF WATER MINGLED WITH A LITTLE GIN BREAKFAST OVER MY UNCLE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A SMALL NOTEBOOK
HIS HEARTY ACCENTS FALTERED AND FELL AWAY AS HE NOTICED THE STERN UNBENDING LOOK ON THE COUNTENANCES OF HIS SILENT FRIENDS AND HIS INVITATION REMAINED UNFINISHED THE BADGER STRODE UP THE STEPS TAKE HIM INSIDE HE SAID STERNLY TO HIS COMPANIONS
A ROPE FASTENED TO THE EDGE OF THE APERTURE MIGHT HAVE HELPED US DOWN BUT HOW WERE WE TO UNFASTEN IT WHEN ARRIVED AT THE OTHER END MY UNCLE EMPLOYED A VERY SIMPLE EXPEDIENT TO OBVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY HE UNCOILED A CORD OF THE THICKNESS OF A FINGER
THE DAY WORE ON AND NO SHADOW CAME TO LAY ITSELF ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER HANS DID NOT MOVE FROM THE SPOT HE HAD SELECTED YET HE MUST BE ASKING HIMSELF WHAT WERE WE WAITING FOR IF HE ASKED HIMSELF ANYTHING AT ALL
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN VERTICAL DESCENT NOW BEGAN OUR REAL JOURNEY HITHERTO OUR TOIL HAD OVERCOME ALL DIFFICULTIES NOW DIFFICULTIES WOULD SPRING UP AT EVERY STEP
IN HALF AN HOUR WE WERE STANDING UPON THE SURFACE OF A ROCK JAMMED IN ACROSS THE CHIMNEY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER HANS PULLED THE ROPE BY ONE OF ITS ENDS THE OTHER ROSE IN THE AIR
THE UNDULATING SURFACE OF THESE ENDLESS MOUNTAINS CRESTED WITH SHEETS OF SNOW REMINDED ONE OF A STORMY SEA IF I LOOKED WESTWARD THERE THE OCEAN LAY SPREAD OUT IN ALL ITS MAGNIFICENCE
THE ORDER OF THESE VOLCANIC FORMATIONS AFFORDS THE STRONGEST CONFIRMATION TO THE THEORIES OF DAVY
BUT ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF JUNE THE LAST DAY BUT ONE OF THE MONTH WITH THE CHANGE OF THE MOON CAME A CHANGE OF WEATHER THE SUN POURED A FLOOD OF LIGHT DOWN THE CRATER EVERY HILLOCK
WE SHALL DESCEND AT A SLOW RATE AND OUR LUNGS WILL BECOME INURED TO A DENSER ATMOSPHERE AERONAUTS FIND THE WANT OF AIR AS THEY RISE TO HIGH ELEVATIONS BUT WE SHALL PERHAPS HAVE TOO MUCH
HE WILL NOT REQUIRE THE CAR PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS FINAL YOU NEEDN'T WAIT THEN HE FOLLOWED THE OTHERS INSIDE AND SHUT THE DOOR
SAID THE RAT AS THEY THRUST HIM INTO HIS BEDROOM
AND HE HAS UNDERTAKEN TO GIVE UP MOTOR CARS ENTIRELY AND FOR EVER I HAVE HIS SOLEMN PROMISE TO THAT EFFECT THAT IS VERY GOOD NEWS SAID THE MOLE GRAVELY VERY GOOD NEWS INDEED OBSERVED THE RAT DUBIOUSLY
AFTER SOME THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BADGER REAPPEARED SOLEMNLY LEADING BY THE PAW A VERY LIMP AND DEJECTED TOAD HIS SKIN HUNG BAGGILY ABOUT HIM
BESIDES ALL THIS HE DEARLY LOVED THE LONGBOW
THAT SPRINGING FROM THE DEWY GRASS HUNG ALOFT ON QUIVERING WINGS IN THE YELLOW SUNLIGHT POURING FORTH ITS SONG THAT FELL LIKE A FALLING STAR FROM THE SKY HIS LUCK LED HIM AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAY NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ARTHUR A BLAND WAS PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE THICKETS
BUT HE WAS UNWILLING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY AND WISHED TO HEAR THE END OF WHAT HE ALREADY ALL BUT KNEW SO HE MERELY SAID WHAT
I FEEL BOUND TO TELL WHAT I WOULD WILLINGLY KEEP SECRET IF I COULD ALL THIS SHE WHO WAS NOW SEEN TO BE A LOVELY WOMAN DELIVERED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION WITH SO MUCH EASE AND IN SO SWEET A VOICE THAT THEY WERE NOT LESS CHARMED BY HER INTELLIGENCE THAN BY HER BEAUTY
IT WAS SAID MOREOVER THAT DON FERNANDO WENT AWAY AT ONCE AND THAT LUSCINDA DID NOT RECOVER FROM HER PROSTRATION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE TOLD HER PARENTS HOW SHE WAS REALLY THE BRIDE OF THAT CARDENIO I HAVE MENTIONED I LEARNED BESIDES THAT CARDENIO
AND RECTITUDE ALONE AND BADE ME CONSIDER THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DON FERNANDO AND MYSELF FROM WHICH I MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT HIS INTENTIONS WHATEVER HE MIGHT SAY TO THE CONTRARY HAD FOR THEIR AIM HIS OWN PLEASURE RATHER THAN MY ADVANTAGE
WERE I TO SEE ANY OF THE THINGS I SPEAK OF IN HIM WHOM MY PARENTS GAVE ME AS A HUSBAND HIS WILL SHOULD BE MINE AND MINE SHOULD BE BOUNDED BY HIS AND MY HONOUR BEING PRESERVED EVEN THOUGH MY INCLINATIONS WERE NOT
CALLED DOWN UPON HIMSELF A THOUSAND CURSES HEREAFTER SHOULD HE FAIL TO KEEP HIS PROMISE SHED MORE TEARS REDOUBLED HIS SIGHS
AT THE SAME TIME I ARGUED THE MATTER BRIEFLY IN MY OWN MIND SAYING TO MYSELF I SHALL NOT BE THE FIRST WHO HAS RISEN THROUGH MARRIAGE FROM A LOWLY TO A LOFTY STATION NOR WILL DON FERNANDO BE THE FIRST WHOM BEAUTY OR AS IS MORE LIKELY A BLIND ATTACHMENT
THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
THEY ARE IN SHORT PEASANTS
ALL THEIR WISHES CENTRED AND MINE WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIRS FOR I KNEW THEIR WORTH AND AS I WAS MISTRESS OF THEIR HEARTS SO WAS I ALSO OF THEIR POSSESSIONS THROUGH ME THEY ENGAGED OR DISMISSED THEIR SERVANTS
WHO WAS INDEED THE ONE WHO HAD ADMITTED HIM GAINED THE STREET BEFORE DAYBREAK BUT ON TAKING LEAVE OF ME HE TOLD ME THOUGH NOT WITH AS MUCH EARNESTNESS AND FERVOUR AS WHEN HE CAME THAT I MIGHT REST ASSURED OF HIS FAITH AND OF THE SANCTITY AND SINCERITY OF HIS OATHS
WHILE I WEARIED MYSELF WITH WATCHING FOR ONE
I AND MY FRIENDS DO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR GOOD SOVEREIGN'S DEER I CARE NOT WHO THOU ART ANSWERED THE BOLD TANNER AND UNLESS THOU HAST MANY MORE OF THY KIND BY THEE THOU CANST NEVER MAKE ARTHUR A BLAND CRY A MERCY
AND DRIVE ME TO INVENT FALSEHOODS IN REPLY BUT ALL THIS WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO AN END FOR THE TIME CAME WHEN ALL SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE DISREGARDED AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER QUESTION OF HONOUR WHEN MY PATIENCE GAVE WAY AND THE SECRET OF MY HEART BECAME KNOWN ABROAD
DOROTHEA HOWEVER DID NOT INTERRUPT HER STORY BUT WENT ON IN THESE WORDS THIS SAD INTELLIGENCE REACHED MY EARS
AND NOW WHAT MAY BE THY NAME HA ARTHUR A BLAND QUOTH ROBIN I HAVE HEARD THY NAME BEFORE GOOD FELLOW THOU DIDST BREAK THE CROWN OF A FRIEND OF MINE AT THE FAIR AT ELY LAST OCTOBER THE FOLK THERE CALL HIM JOCK O NOTTINGHAM WE CALL HIM WILL SCATHELOCK
INDULGING IN FAINT AND DISTANT HOPES OF CHERISHING THAT LIFE THAT I NOW ABHOR BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE CITY UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO AS I COULD NOT FIND DON FERNANDO I HEARD NOTICE GIVEN BY THE PUBLIC CRIER OFFERING A GREAT REWARD TO ANYONE WHO SHOULD FIND ME
HIS CUDGEL FLYING FROM HIS HAND AS HE FELL THEN RAISING HIS STAFF STOUT ARTHUR DEALT HIM ANOTHER BLOW UPON THE RIBS HOLD ROARED LITTLE JOHN
BY THIS THEY KNEW THAT WHAT HAD SEEMED A PEASANT WAS A LOVELY WOMAN NAY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THE EYES OF TWO OF THEM HAD EVER BEHELD OR EVEN CARDENIO'S IF THEY HAD NOT SEEN AND KNOWN LUSCINDA
AND GIVING THE PARTICULARS OF MY AGE AND OF THE VERY DRESS I WORE AND I HEARD IT SAID THAT THE LAD WHO CAME WITH ME HAD TAKEN ME AWAY FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE A THING THAT CUT ME TO THE HEART SHOWING HOW LOW MY GOOD NAME HAD FALLEN SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT I SHOULD LOSE IT BY MY FLIGHT
OR AT LEAST TO SECURE ADDITIONAL PROTECTORS TO WATCH OVER ME AND THIS INTELLIGENCE OR SUSPICION MADE HIM ACT AS YOU SHALL HEAR ONE NIGHT AS I WAS IN MY CHAMBER WITH NO OTHER COMPANION THAN A DAMSEL WHO WAITED ON ME WITH
LITTLE JOHN TROD UPON A STICK WHICH SNAPPED UNDER HIS FOOT WHEREUPON HEARING THE NOISE THE TANNER TURNED QUICKLY AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE YEOMAN SEEING THAT THE TANNER HAD SPIED HIM OUT LITTLE JOHN PUT A BOLD FACE UPON THE MATTER
HAPPY AND FORTUNATE WERE THE TIMES WHEN THAT MOST DARING KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS SENT INTO THE WORLD
AFTER AN EFFORT TO RESTRAIN SOME TEARS THAT CAME TO HER EYES IN A CLEAR AND STEADY VOICE BEGAN HER STORY THUS
PASSED THROUGH MY MIND IN A MOMENT BUT THE OATHS OF DON FERNANDO THE WITNESSES HE APPEALED TO THE TEARS HE SHED AND LASTLY THE CHARMS OF HIS PERSON AND HIS HIGH BRED GRACE WHICH ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH SIGNS OF GENUINE LOVE
FOR IT MAY BE THAT MY ILL FORTUNE CAME OF THEIRS IN NOT HAVING BEEN NOBLY BORN IT IS TRUE THEY ARE NOT SO LOW THAT THEY HAVE ANY REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF THEIR CONDITION
AND WHOM I ENTREATED TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE CITY WHERE I HEARD MY ENEMY WAS
FOR HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT WHO SHE WAS SHE HOWEVER WITHOUT NOTICING THE EXCITEMENT OF CARDENIO CONTINUING HER STORY WENT ON TO SAY
FOR EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME THAT MUSIC SOOTHES THE TROUBLED MIND AND RELIEVES WEARINESS OF SPIRIT SUCH WAS THE LIFE I LED IN MY PARENTS HOUSE AND IF I HAVE DEPICTED IT THUS MINUTELY IT IS NOT OUT OF OSTENTATION OR TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM RICH BUT
I HAVE HEARD OF ANOTHER OF THE SAME NAME WHO CAN PERHAPS MATCH YOUR MISFORTUNES BUT PROCEED BY AND BY I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU AS MUCH AS IT WILL EXCITE YOUR COMPASSION DOROTHEA WAS STRUCK BY CARDENIO'S WORDS AS WELL AS BY HIS STRANGE AND MISERABLE ATTIRE
NAY I PASS NOT FOR LENGTH ANSWERED THE TANNER MY STAFF IS LONG ENOUGH TO KNOCK DOWN A CALF SO LOOK TO THYSELF FELLOW I SAY AGAIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO EACH GRIPPED HIS STAFF IN THE MIDDLE AND WITH FELL AND ANGRY LOOKS THEY CAME SLOWLY TOGETHER
HE LAID ASIDE THE ENTREATIES WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED AT FIRST AND BEGAN TO USE VIOLENCE BUT JUST HEAVEN THAT SELDOM FAILS TO WATCH OVER AND AID GOOD INTENTIONS SO AIDED MINE THAT WITH MY SLIGHT STRENGTH AND WITH LITTLE EXERTION
FOR I KNOW MY GOOD MASTER WOULD NOT HAVE ME WET TO THE SKIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO OFF HE STRODE DOWN THE PATH THAT LAY THE WAY OF HIS LIKINGS NOW THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY FOUL WEATHER BUT
AND ONE OF HIS VASSALS I TOLD HIM NOT TO LET MY BEAUTY SUCH AS IT WAS BLIND HIM
AND I HAD NOT THE SPIRIT OR ELSE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO CHIDE MY MAID FOR THE TREACHERY SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF IN CONCEALING DON FERNANDO IN MY CHAMBER FOR AS YET I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHETHER WHAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WAS FOR GOOD OR EVIL
THEN UP GOT LITTLE JOHN AND TAKING THE BAG OF GOLD WHICH HE THRUST INTO HIS BOSOM
MAYHAP I MAY CHANCE TO CATCH A SIGHT OF THE DAINTY BROWN DARLINGS THUS EARLY IN THE MORN FOR THERE WAS NOTHING HE LOVED BETTER THAN TO LOOK UPON A TRIPPING HERD OF DEER
IF NOT TO RELIEVE YOUR DISTRESS AT LEAST TO OFFER YOU COMFORT FOR NO DISTRESS SO LONG AS LIFE LASTS CAN BE SO OPPRESSIVE OR REACH SUCH A HEIGHT AS TO MAKE THE SUFFERER REFUSE TO LISTEN TO COMFORT OFFERED WITH GOOD INTENTION AND SO SENORA
HAND AND FOOT TO ANY MAN IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND I WAS SEEKING THEE TO CHIDE THEE FOR LEAVING MY BIDDING UNDONE BUT THOU HAST BEEN PAID ALL I OWED THEE
AND ON THE OTHER AS WELL LITTLE JOHN KNEW TO THE MERRY BLUE BOAR INN HERE LITTLE JOHN SUDDENLY CEASED WHISTLING AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH FIRST HE LOOKED UP AND THEN HE LOOKED DOWN AND THEN TILTING HIS CAP OVER ONE EYE HE SLOWLY SCRATCHED THE BACK PART OF HIS HEAD FOR THUS IT WAS
THIS POOR FELLOW WHOM THOU HAST SO BELABORED IS COUNTED THE BEST HAND AT THE QUARTERSTAFF IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND HIS NAME IS LITTLE JOHN AND MINE ROBIN HOOD
I DID THINK THERE WAS NEVER A MAN IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE COULD DO TO ME WHAT THOU HAST DONE THIS DAY AND SO THOUGHT I ALSO CRIED ROBIN HOOD BURSTING OUT OF THE THICKET AND SHOUTING WITH LAUGHTER TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
EACH WATCHING FOR A CHANCE TO TAKE THE OTHER UNAWARE AND SO GET IN THE FIRST BLOW AT LAST LITTLE JOHN STRUCK LIKE A FLASH AND RAP THE TANNER MET THE BLOW AND TURNED IT ASIDE AND THEN SMOTE BACK AT LITTLE JOHN WHO ALSO TURNED THE BLOW AND SO THIS MIGHTY BATTLE BEGAN
SAID LITTLE JOHN SITTING UP AND FEELING HIS RIBS WHERE THE TANNER HAD CUDGELED HIM I MAKE MY VOW MY RIBS FEEL AS THOUGH EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE BROKEN IN TWAIN
ACROSS THE TANNER'S SHOULDERS WAS SLUNG HIS STOUT QUARTERSTAFF EVER NEAR ENOUGH TO HIM TO BE GRIPPED QUICKLY AND ON HIS HEAD WAS A CAP OF DOUBLED COWHIDE SO TOUGH THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE CLOVEN EVEN BY A BROADSWORD NOW QUOTH ARTHUR A BLAND TO HIMSELF
PROFESSIONS TO ME THAT I KNOW NOT HOW FALSEHOOD COULD HAVE HAD THE POWER OF DRESSING THEM UP TO SEEM SO LIKE TRUTH AND THE TRAITOR CONTRIVED THAT HIS TEARS SHOULD VOUCH FOR HIS WORDS AND HIS SIGHS FOR HIS SINCERITY
AND UNSEEN AS I THOUGHT BY ANY EXCEPT THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE FOR WHEN I WENT TO MASS IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I WAS SO CLOSELY ATTENDED BY MY MOTHER AND THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND
THIS BEING SO I SAY I THANK YOU SIRS FOR THE OFFER YOU HAVE MADE ME WHICH PLACES ME UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST YOU HAVE MADE OF ME THOUGH I FEAR THE ACCOUNT I SHALL GIVE YOU OF MY MISFORTUNES WILL EXCITE IN YOU AS MUCH CONCERN AS COMPASSION
WHICH THEY DID OBSERVING CLOSELY WHAT THE YOUTH WAS ABOUT HE HAD ON A LOOSE DOUBLE SKIRTED DARK BROWN JACKET BOUND TIGHT TO HIS BODY WITH A WHITE CLOTH HE WORE BESIDES BREECHES AND GAITERS OF BROWN CLOTH AND ON HIS HEAD A BROWN MONTERA AND
BUT AN HONEST CRAFTSMAN AS FOR MY COUNTENANCE IT IS WHAT IT IS AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT THINE OWN IS NONE TOO PRETTY THOU SAUCY FELLOW HA QUOTH LITTLE JOHN IN A GREAT LOUD VOICE WOULDST THOU GIVE ME BACKTALK
THERE TO SELL A HALFSCORE OF TANNED COWHIDES AT THE DAWN OF THE SAME DAY THAT LITTLE JOHN LEFT THE INN HE STARTED FROM NOTTINGHAM HOMEWARD FOR BLYTH HIS WAY LED ALL IN THE DEWY MORN PAST THE VERGE OF SHERWOOD FOREST WHERE THE BIRDS WERE WELCOMING THE LOVELY DAY WITH A GREAT AND MERRY JUBILEE
SO THAT THE KING'S RANGERS KEPT A SHREWD EYE UPON HIM AND HIS DOINGS FOR ARTHUR A BLAND'S HOUSE WAS APT TO HAVE APLENTY OF MEAT IN IT THAT WAS MORE LIKE VENISON THAN THE LAW ALLOWED NOW ARTHUR HAD BEEN TO NOTTINGHAM TOWN THE DAY BEFORE LITTLE JOHN SET FORTH ON HIS ERRAND
I WOULD NOT LET THE OCCASION PASS SENORA REPLIED CARDENIO OF TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK
THE LONG AUBURN TRESSES NOT ONLY COVERED HER SHOULDERS BUT SUCH WAS THEIR LENGTH AND ABUNDANCE CONCEALED HER ALL ROUND BENEATH THEIR MASSES SO THAT EXCEPT THE FEET NOTHING OF HER FORM WAS VISIBLE SHE NOW USED HER HANDS AS A COMB
HEARING A RUSTLING OF THE BRANCHES LITTLE JOHN STOPPED AND PRESENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BROWN COWHIDE CAP OF THE TANNER MOVING AMONG THE BUSHES I DO MUCH WONDER
HAST THOU HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE TANNER GRIMLY HOLDING HIS STAFF ALOFT AY MARRY AND MORE THAN ENOUGH AND THOU DOST OWN THAT I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO YEA TRULY AND A MURRAIN SEIZE THEE
NEVER HAD I THOUGHT TO SEE LITTLE JOHN SO EVENLY MATCHED IN ALL MY LIFE BELIKE THOUGH
WHAT YOUR DRESS WOULD HIDE SENORA IS MADE KNOWN TO US BY YOUR HAIR A CLEAR PROOF THAT IT CAN BE NO TRIFLING CAUSE THAT HAS DISGUISED YOUR BEAUTY IN A GARB SO UNWORTHY OF IT AND SENT IT INTO SOLITUDES LIKE THESE WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND YOU
QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TO HIMSELF WHAT YON KNAVE IS AFTER THAT HE SHOULD GO THUS PEEPING AND PEERING ABOUT I VERILY BELIEVE THAT YON SCURVY VARLET IS NO BETTER THAN A THIEF AND COMETH HERE AFTER OUR OWN AND THE GOOD KING'S DUN DEER FOR
ACCORDINGLY QUITTING THE PATH HE WENT PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH SPYING NOW HERE AND NOW THERE WITH ALL THE WILES OF A MASTER OF WOODCRAFT AND OF ONE WHO HAD MORE THAN ONCE DONNED A DOUBLET OF LINCOLN GREEN
BE THE ONLY SCRUPLE YOU FEEL FAIREST DOROTHEA FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS UNHAPPY BEING SEE HERE I GIVE YOU MY HAND TO BE YOURS AND LET HEAVEN
NOW NEWS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO ROBIN HOOD HOW THAT LITTLE JOHN INSTEAD OF DOING HIS BIDDING HAD PASSED BY DUTY FOR PLEASURE AND SO HAD STOPPED OVERNIGHT WITH MERRY COMPANY AT THE BLUE BOAR INN INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT TO ANCASTER
I REMEMBER TOO HOW MY MAID HEARD THOSE WORDS IN REPROOF OF HER AUDACITY THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE AND HOW I WAS FORCED TO PUT A CONSTRAINT ON MY TEARS AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF MY COUNTENANCE NOT TO GIVE MY PARENTS CAUSE TO ASK ME WHY I WAS SO MELANCHOLY
I HAVE MY SELF RESPECT AS MUCH AS YOU A LORD AND GENTLEMAN WITH ME YOUR VIOLENCE WILL BE TO NO PURPOSE YOUR WEALTH WILL HAVE NO WEIGHT YOUR WORDS WILL HAVE NO POWER TO DECEIVE ME NOR YOUR SIGHS OR TEARS TO SOFTEN ME
ALL THIS WAS HEARD DISTINCTLY BY THE CURATE AND THOSE WITH HIM AND AS IT SEEMED TO THEM TO BE UTTERED CLOSE BY AS INDEED IT WAS THEY GOT UP TO LOOK FOR THE SPEAKER AND BEFORE THEY HAD GONE TWENTY PACES THEY DISCOVERED BEHIND A ROCK SEATED AT THE FOOT OF AN ASH TREE
REVIVED MY HOPES AND I WAS BETTER PLEASED NOT TO HAVE FOUND DON FERNANDO THAN TO FIND HIM MARRIED FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT YET ENTIRELY SHUT UPON RELIEF IN MY CASE AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HEAVEN HAD PUT THIS IMPEDIMENT IN THE WAY OF THE SECOND MARRIAGE
IT WOULD BE IDLE FOR ME NOW TO MAKE ANY FURTHER PRETENCE OF WHAT IF YOU WERE TO BELIEVE ME YOU WOULD BELIEVE MORE OUT OF COURTESY THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON
LOOKING UP INTO THE BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH BRIGHT CLOUDS WERE SAILING LIKE SILVER BOATS AND SWALLOWS SKIMMING IN CIRCLING FLIGHT QUOTH HE
FOR I WILL GIVE THEE SUCH A DRUBBING AS NE'ER HAST THOU HAD IN ALL THY LIFE BEFORE TAKE THY STAFF IN THY HAND FELLOW FOR I WILL NOT SMITE AN UNARMED MAN
I FEAR ME THOUGH THERE IS BUT POOR CHANCE OF MY SEEING SUCH A PLEASANT SIGHT SO SAYING HE STRETCHED HIMSELF AT LENGTH UPON THE GROUND THAT HE MIGHT NOT ONLY SEE THE SPORT THE BETTER BUT THAT HE MIGHT ENJOY THE MERRY SIGHT AT HIS EASE
THERE ARE OTHER INNS THAT THOU KNOWEST YET HEREABOUTS
MARRY A DID REACH OUT HIS ARM FULL LENGTH WHILE THOU STOOD GAPING AT HIM AND WITH A PRETTY RAP TUMBLED THEE OVER AS NEVER HAVE I SEEN ONE TUMBLED BEFORE SO SPOKE BOLD ROBIN
I WILL FOLLOW THEE TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH GOOD MASTER AND NOT A HERD OF DUN DEER IN ALL THE FOREST BUT SHALL KNOW THE SOUND OF THE TWANG OF MY BOWSTRING AS FOR THEE LITTLE JOHN SAID ROBIN TURNING TO HIM AND LAUGHING
BY MUCH ROVING IN THE FOREST LITTLE JOHN HAD COME TO LOOK UPON ALL THE DEER IN SHERWOOD AS BELONGING TO ROBIN HOOD AND HIS BAND AS MUCH AS TO GOOD KING HARRY NAY
FRESH CANS OF ALE WERE BROUGHT AND WITH JEST AND SONG AND MERRY TALES THE HOURS SLIPPED AWAY ON FLEETING WINGS NONE THOUGHT OF TIME OR TIDE TILL THE NIGHT WAS SO FAR GONE THAT LITTLE JOHN PUT BY THE THOUGHT OF SETTING FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND SO
CRUSH CLODS OR TO FOLLOW THE PLOUGH AND THE OXEN AS THEIR OWNER'S DRESS SUGGESTED AND SO FINDING THEY HAD NOT BEEN NOTICED THE CURATE WHO WAS IN FRONT MADE A SIGN TO THE OTHER TWO TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES BEHIND SOME FRAGMENTS OF ROCK THAT LAY THERE
HAS LED TO MATE HIMSELF BELOW HIS RANK THEN SINCE I AM INTRODUCING NO NEW USAGE OR PRACTICE
BUT ALSO OF THE TALES AND EPISODES CONTAINED IN IT WHICH ARE IN A MEASURE NO LESS PLEASING INGENIOUS AND TRUTHFUL THAN THE HISTORY ITSELF WHICH RESUMING ITS THREAD CARDED SPUN AND WOUND RELATES THAT JUST AS THE CURATE WAS GOING TO OFFER CONSOLATION TO CARDENIO
BIDED AT THE BLUE BOAR INN UNTIL THE MORROW NOW IT WAS AN ILL PIECE OF LUCK FOR LITTLE JOHN THAT HE LEFT HIS DUTY FOR HIS PLEASURE AND HE PAID A GREAT SCORE FOR IT AS WE ARE ALL APT TO DO IN THE SAME CASE AS YOU SHALL SEE
FOR MARRIAGES SO UNEQUAL NEVER BROUGHT HAPPINESS NOR DID THEY CONTINUE LONG TO AFFORD THE ENJOYMENT THEY BEGAN WITH ALL THIS THAT I HAVE NOW REPEATED I SAID TO HIM AND MUCH MORE WHICH I CANNOT RECOLLECT BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT IN INDUCING HIM TO FOREGO HIS PURPOSE
AND IF I WERE AT ALL DESIROUS OF OPPOSING AN OBSTACLE TO HIS UNREASONABLE SUIT THEY WERE READY THEY SAID TO MARRY ME AT ONCE TO ANYONE I PREFERRED EITHER AMONG THE LEADING PEOPLE OF OUR OWN TOWN OR
AT THIS ROBIN HOOD STOPPED AND LISTENED SURELY QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF THAT IS LITTLE JOHN'S VOICE AND HE IS TALKING IN ANGER ALSO METHINKS THE OTHER IS STRANGE TO MY EARS
AND TO CONFIRM HIS WORDS HE DREW A RICH RING OFF HIS FINGER AND PLACED IT UPON MINE HE THEN TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND I WAS LEFT I KNOW NOT WHETHER SORROWFUL OR HAPPY ALL I CAN SAY IS I WAS LEFT AGITATED AND TROUBLED IN MIND AND ALMOST BEWILDERED BY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
LOWLY IN ORIGIN BUT SO WEALTHY THAT IF BIRTH HAD CONFERRED AS MUCH ON THEM AS FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING LEFT TO DESIRE NOR SHOULD I HAVE HAD REASON TO FEAR TROUBLE LIKE THAT IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF NOW
AT THE SIGHT OF THESE TWO ROADS TWO VOICES BEGAN TO ALARUM WITHIN HIM THE ONE CRYING THERE LIES THE ROAD TO THE BLUE BOAR INN A CAN OF BROWN OCTOBER AND A MERRY NIGHT WITH SWEET COMPANIONS SUCH AS THOU MAYST FIND THERE THE OTHER
AS THUS HE STRODE ALONG IN ANGER PUTTING TOGETHER THE WORDS HE WOULD USE TO CHIDE LITTLE JOHN HE HEARD OF A SUDDEN LOUD AND ANGRY VOICES
FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER SON OF THE DUKE I TOLD OF THE MOMENT THE SPEAKER MENTIONED THE NAME OF DON FERNANDO
AND AS THE SAYING IS OLD RUSTY CHRISTIANS BUT SO RICH THAT BY THEIR WEALTH AND FREE HANDED WAY OF LIFE THEY ARE COMING BY DEGREES TO BE CONSIDERED GENTLEFOLK BY BIRTH AND EVEN BY POSITION
AND AS THEY AGAIN REPEATED THEIR OFFERS AND ENTREATIES TO HER TO FULFIL HER PROMISE SHE WITHOUT FURTHER PRESSING FIRST MODESTLY COVERING HER FEET AND GATHERING UP HER HAIR SEATED HERSELF ON A STONE WITH THE THREE PLACED AROUND HER AND
A YOUTH IN THE DRESS OF A PEASANT WHOSE FACE THEY WERE UNABLE AT THE MOMENT TO SEE AS HE WAS LEANING FORWARD BATHING HIS FEET IN THE BROOK THAT FLOWED PAST THEY APPROACHED SO SILENTLY THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THEM BEING FULLY OCCUPIED IN BATHING HIS FEET
AND THIS I SAY LEST YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE THAT ANY BUT MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SHALL EVER WIN ANYTHING OF ME IF THAT
AND TAKING HIS STOUT PIKESTAFF IN HIS HAND HE SET FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY ONCE MORE AS THOUGH HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN THE GOOD TOWN OF BLYTH THERE LIVED A STOUT TANNER CELEBRATED FAR AND NEAR FOR FEATS OF STRENGTH AND MANY TOUGH BOUTS AT WRESTLING AND THE QUARTERSTAFF
ALL THIS WAS A MATTER OF NOTORIETY IN THE CITY AND EVERYONE SPOKE OF IT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT LUSCINDA WAS MISSING FROM HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND FROM THE CITY FOR SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE TO THE DISTRACTION OF HER PARENTS WHO KNEW NOT WHAT STEPS TO TAKE TO RECOVER HER WHAT I LEARNED
AND BEGGED HIM IF HE KNEW ANYTHING CONCERNING HER TO TELL IT TO HER AT ONCE FOR IF FORTUNE HAD LEFT HER ANY BLESSING IT WAS COURAGE TO BEAR WHATEVER CALAMITY MIGHT FALL UPON HER AS SHE FELT SURE THAT NONE COULD REACH HER CAPABLE OF INCREASING IN ANY DEGREE WHAT SHE ENDURED ALREADY
AS WELL AS THE REPEATED ADVICE OF MY PARENTS WHO NOW VERY PLAINLY PERCEIVED DON FERNANDO'S PURPOSE FOR HE CARED VERY LITTLE IF ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT THEY TOLD ME THEY TRUSTED AND CONFIDED THEIR HONOUR AND GOOD NAME TO MY VIRTUE
ON SEEING THIS DON FERNANDO PERSUADED THAT LUSCINDA HAD BEFOOLED SLIGHTED AND TRIFLED WITH HIM ASSAILED HER BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON AND TRIED TO STAB HER WITH THE DAGGER THAT HAD BEEN FOUND AND WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD NOT HER PARENTS AND THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT PREVENTED HIM
AND I NEVER GAVE DON FERNANDO A WORD IN REPLY THAT COULD HOLD OUT TO HIM ANY HOPE OF SUCCESS HOWEVER REMOTE ALL THIS CAUTION OF MINE WHICH HE MUST HAVE TAKEN FOR COYNESS HAD APPARENTLY THE EFFECT OF INCREASING HIS WANTON APPETITE FOR
THROUGH MY HANDS PASSED THE ACCOUNTS AND RETURNS OF WHAT WAS SOWN AND REAPED THE OIL MILLS THE WINE PRESSES THE COUNT OF THE FLOCKS AND HERDS THE BEEHIVES ALL IN SHORT THAT A RICH FARMER LIKE MY FATHER HAS OR CAN HAVE I HAD UNDER MY CARE
IT WAS SAID TOO THAT HER NAME WAS LUSCINDA AND THAT AT THE BETROTHAL SOME STRANGE THINGS HAD HAPPENED
AS THIS IS NOT LUSCINDA IT IS NO HUMAN CREATURE BUT A DIVINE BEING THE YOUTH THEN TOOK OFF THE MONTERA AND SHAKING HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE THERE BROKE LOOSE AND SPREAD OUT A MASS OF HAIR THAT THE BEAMS OF THE SUN MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
AT THE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HIS TRUSTY RIGHT HAND MAN WAS IN SOME DANGER OF HIS LIFE SO CAUTIOUSLY
TO LEAD HIM TO RECOGNISE HIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORMER ONE AND REFLECT THAT AS A CHRISTIAN HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER HIS SOUL ABOVE ALL HUMAN OBJECTS ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND AND I STROVE TO COMFORT MYSELF WITHOUT COMFORT
I TOLD DON FERNANDO AT PARTING THAT AS I WAS NOW HIS HE MIGHT SEE ME ON OTHER NIGHTS IN THE SAME WAY UNTIL IT SHOULD BE HIS PLEASURE TO LET THE MATTER BECOME KNOWN BUT EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE CAME NO MORE NOR FOR MORE THAN A MONTH COULD I CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM IN THE STREET OR IN CHURCH
HA QUOTH ROBIN TO HIMSELF HERE IS MERRY SPORT AFOOT NOW I WOULD GIVE THREE GOLDEN ANGELS FROM MY OWN POCKET IF YON STOUT FELLOW WOULD GIVE LITTLE JOHN A RIGHT SOUND DRUBBING IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO SEE HIM WELL THUMPED FOR HAVING FAILED IN MY BIDDING
AND SO I WAS LEFT BY MY MAID AND CEASED TO BE ONE AND HE BECAME A TRAITOR AND A PERJURED MAN THE DAY WHICH FOLLOWED THE NIGHT OF MY MISFORTUNE DID NOT COME SO QUICKLY I IMAGINE AS DON FERNANDO WISHED
AND THOSE DESPATCHED IN SEARCH OF ME BY HIS ORDERS IT IS NOW I KNOW NOT HOW MANY MONTHS SINCE WITH THIS OBJECT I CAME HERE WHERE I MET A HERDSMAN WHO ENGAGED ME AS HIS SERVANT AT A PLACE IN THE HEART OF THIS SIERRA
HER DELICATE FEET BEING UNABLE TO BEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF THE STONES SEEING WHICH THE THREE HASTENED TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE ADDRESSING HER FIRST SAID STAY SENORA WHOEVER YOU MAY BE FOR THOSE WHOM YOU SEE HERE ONLY DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
BUT THEY MUST ADD WITH WHOM I HAD FLED AND THAT ONE SO MUCH BENEATH ME AND SO UNWORTHY OF MY CONSIDERATION THE INSTANT I HEARD THE NOTICE I QUITTED THE CITY WITH MY SERVANT WHO NOW BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF WAVERING IN HIS FIDELITY TO ME AND THE SAME NIGHT FOR FEAR OF DISCOVERY
BUT ALL MY CARE AND PAINS WERE UNAVAILING FOR MY MASTER MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT I WAS NOT A MAN AND HARBOURED THE SAME BASE DESIGNS AS MY SERVANT
FOR HE TOO HAD TALKED HIMSELF INTO A FUME BIG WORDS NE'ER KILLED SO MUCH AS A MOUSE WHO ART THOU THAT TALKEST SO FREELY OF CRACKING THE HEAD OF ARTHUR A BLAND IF I DO NOT TAN THY HIDE THIS DAY AS NE'ER I TANNED A CALF'S HIDE IN ALL MY LIFE BEFORE
ACCORDING TO REPORT HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BETROTHAL AND THAT UPON SEEING HER BETROTHED CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATION HE HAD QUITTED THE CITY IN DESPAIR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LETTER DECLARING THE WRONG LUSCINDA HAD DONE HIM AND HIS INTENTION OF GOING WHERE NO ONE SHOULD EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
YOU HAVE NO NEED TO ATTEMPT A FLIGHT SO HEEDLESS FOR NEITHER CAN YOUR FEET BEAR IT NOR WE ALLOW IT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND BEWILDERED SHE MADE NO REPLY TO THESE WORDS THEY HOWEVER CAME TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE TAKING HER HAND WENT ON TO SAY
I HAD NO POWER TO UTTER A CRY NOR I THINK DID HE GIVE ME TIME TO UTTER ONE AS HE IMMEDIATELY APPROACHED ME AND TAKING ME IN HIS ARMS FOR OVERWHELMED AS I WAS I WAS POWERLESS I SAY TO HELP MYSELF HE BEGAN TO MAKE SUCH
BUT ON THE CURATE ADDRESSING SOME FURTHER WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT TO HER SIGHING DEEPLY SHE BROKE SILENCE AND SAID SINCE THE SOLITUDE OF THESE MOUNTAINS HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL ME AND THE ESCAPE OF MY DISHEVELLED TRESSES WILL NOT ALLOW MY TONGUE TO DEAL IN FALSEHOODS
AN AFFAIR OF SUCH NOTORIETY IN THE CITY THAT IT WAS THE TALK OF EVERY KNOT OF IDLERS IN THE STREET HE SAID THAT ON THE NIGHT OF DON FERNANDO'S BETROTHAL WITH LUSCINDA AS SOON AS SHE HAD CONSENTED TO BE HIS BRIDE BY SAYING YES SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN FAINTING FIT
SO BEING VEXED TO HIS HEART BY THIS HE SET FORTH AT DAWN OF DAY TO SEEK LITTLE JOHN AT THE BLUE BOAR OR AT LEAST TO MEET THE YEOMAN ON THE WAY AND EASE HIS HEART OF WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE MATTER
NAY QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TESTILY AT THE SAME TIME RISING CAREFULLY AS THOUGH HIS BONES HAD BEEN MADE OF GLASS I CAN HELP MYSELF GOOD FELLOW WITHOUT THY AID AND LET ME TELL THEE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT VILE COWSKIN CAP OF THINE
I PUSHED HIM OVER A PRECIPICE WHERE I LEFT HIM WHETHER DEAD OR ALIVE I KNOW NOT AND THEN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN SEEMED POSSIBLE IN MY TERROR AND FATIGUE I MADE MY WAY INTO THE MOUNTAINS WITHOUT ANY OTHER THOUGHT OR PURPOSE SAVE THAT OF HIDING MYSELF AMONG THEM AND ESCAPING MY FATHER
AND IF HER FEET HAD SEEMED LIKE BITS OF CRYSTAL IN THE WATER HER HANDS LOOKED LIKE PIECES OF DRIVEN SNOW AMONG HER LOCKS ALL WHICH INCREASED NOT ONLY THE ADMIRATION OF THE THREE BEHOLDERS BUT THEIR ANXIETY TO LEARN WHO SHE WAS WITH THIS OBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO SHOW THEMSELVES
NOW HEAVEN FORFEND THAT MY GOOD TRUSTY LITTLE JOHN SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE KING'S RANGERS I MUST SEE TO THIS MATTER AND THAT QUICKLY THUS SPOKE ROBIN HOOD TO HIMSELF ALL HIS ANGER PASSING AWAY LIKE A BREATH FROM THE WINDOWPANE
FOR YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING TO REMEDY THEM OR ANY CONSOLATION TO ALLEVIATE THEM HOWEVER THAT MY HONOUR MAY NOT BE LEFT A MATTER OF DOUBT IN YOUR MINDS NOW THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED ME TO BE A WOMAN
AND I WAS NOT DISPLEASED AT SEEING MY PRAISES IN HIS LETTERS FOR HOWEVER UGLY WE WOMEN MAY BE IT SEEMS TO ME IT ALWAYS PLEASES US TO HEAR OURSELVES CALLED BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT MY OWN SENSE OF RIGHT WAS OPPOSED TO ALL THIS
AND THAT ON THE BRIDEGROOM APPROACHING TO UNLACE THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS TO GIVE HER AIR
AND AS THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHILD TO MAKE THEIR HEIR AND ARE AFFECTIONATE PARENTS I WAS ONE OF THE MOST INDULGED DAUGHTERS THAT EVER PARENTS INDULGED
BY THIS TIME MY EARS HAD GROWN SO ACCUSTOMED TO THE QUIET THAT I COULD HEAR THE TICKING OF THE CLOCK INSIDE AS IT SLOWLY COUNTED OUT THE SECONDS BUT WHOEVER WAS IN THAT HOUSE KEPT DEADLY STILL AND MUST HAVE HELD HIS BREATH
BUT HE'S DEAD YOU SEE AND PEOPLE WILL MAKE IT OUT AGAINST AN OFFICER OF HIS MAJESTY'S REVENUE IF MAKE IT OUT THEY CAN NOW I'LL TELL YOU HAWKINS IF YOU LIKE I'LL TAKE YOU ALONG I THANKED HIM HEARTILY FOR THE OFFER
BEN AS HE SCANNED THE BUILDINGS ON THE RAPENBURG CANAL WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY OF LEYDEN BUT WHEN HE RECALLED ITS HISTORY HOW ATTENDED WITH ALL THE POMP OF A GRAND CIVIC DISPLAY
SOME NEWS OF THE LUGGER IN KITT'S HOLE HAD FOUND ITS WAY TO SUPERVISOR DANCE AND SET HIM FORTH THAT NIGHT IN OUR DIRECTION AND TO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE MY MOTHER AND I OWED OUR PRESERVATION FROM DEATH PEW WAS DEAD
AND SLOW AS I BEGAN TO TRAVEL I STILL KEPT ASKING MY WAY AND STILL KEPT ADVANCING
THE BETTER TO SET THIS FEAR AT REST I CHANGED THE FORM OF MY INQUIRIES AND SPYING AN HONEST FELLOW COMING ALONG A LANE ON THE SHAFT OF HIS CART I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD EVER HEARD TELL OF A HOUSE THEY CALLED THE HOUSE OF SHAWS
THEN THERE FOLLOWED A GREAT TO DO THROUGH ALL OUR OLD INN HEAVY FEET POUNDING TO AND FRO FURNITURE THROWN OVER DOORS KICKED IN UNTIL THE VERY ROCKS RE ECHOED
FINE BROAD PROMENADES SHADED BY NOBLE TREES BORDER THE CANALS AND ADD TO THE RETIRED APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSES BEHIND HEIGHTENING THE EFFECT OF SCHOLASTIC SECLUSION THAT SEEMS TO PERVADE THE PLACE
WHAT SAY I NOT MISTER EBENEZER
SAID I FOR I WAS GROWING VERY WROTH WELL
I AM NOT ASHAMED OF MY NAME SAID I THEY CALL ME DAVID BALFOUR AT THAT I MADE SURE THE MAN STARTED
HE CRIED WE DON'T SEE IT HERE NOHOW RETURNED THE MAN HERE YOU BELOW THERE IS IT ON BILL CRIED THE BLIND MAN AGAIN
BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND OF SPEECH AND NOT A DOG BARKED
THEY RESTED AWHILE AND THEN TOOK ANOTHER WHICH FOR FORM'S SAKE THEY CALLED DINNER AFTER DINNER THE BOYS SAT WARMING THEMSELVES AT THE INN ALL BUT PETER WHO OCCUPIED THE TIME IN ANOTHER FRUITLESS SEARCH FOR DOCTOR BOEKMAN
HE STOPPED HIS CART AND LOOKED AT ME LIKE THE OTHERS AY SAID HE WHAT FOR IT'S A GREAT HOUSE I ASKED DOUBTLESS SAYS HE
AND POINTED TO A GREAT BULK OF BUILDING STANDING VERY BARE UPON A GREEN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NEXT VALLEY THE COUNTRY WAS PLEASANT ROUND ABOUT RUNNING IN LOW HILLS PLEASANTLY WATERED AND WOODED AND THE CROPS TO MY EYES WONDERFULLY GOOD
ANOTHER PAUSE AND THEN DEFIANTLY
OTHERS CROUCH BEFORE THE PUBLIC EDIFICES AND CHURCHES BEING CLEAN SPACIOUS WELL SHADED AND ADORNED WITH MANY ELEGANT MANSIONS
AND A RUSH WAS MADE UPON THE ADMIRAL BENBOW THE LANTERN BEARER FOLLOWING AND THEN I COULD SEE THEM PAUSE AND HEAR SPEECHES PASSED IN A LOWER KEY AS IF THEY WERE SURPRISED TO FIND THE DOOR OPEN
YE CAN PUT IT DOWN UPON THE DOORSTEP AND BE OFF WITH YE I WILL DO NO SUCH THING I CRIED I WILL DELIVER IT INTO MISTER BALFOUR'S HANDS AS IT WAS MEANT I SHOULD IT IS A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION A WHAT
I CAME BY A HOUSE WHERE A SHEPHERD LIVED AND GOT A ROUGH DIRECTION FOR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF CRAMOND AND SO FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WORKED MY WAY TO THE WESTWARD OF THE CAPITAL BY COLINTON TILL I CAME OUT UPON THE GLASGOW ROAD AND THERE TO MY GREAT PLEASURE AND WONDER
THE TOWER STOOD HIGHER WHEN MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES AGO THE INHABITANTS OF BELEAGUERED LEYDEN SHOUTED TO THE WATCHER ON ITS TOP THEIR WILD DESPAIRING CRIES IS THERE ANY HELP ARE THE WATERS RISING
AND I MADE OUT EVEN THROUGH THE MIST THAT THE MIDDLE MAN OF THIS TRIO WAS THE BLIND BEGGAR THE NEXT MOMENT HIS VOICE SHOWED ME THAT I WAS RIGHT DOWN WITH THE DOOR HE CRIED AYE AYE SIR ANSWERED TWO OR THREE
THE PRIDE OF LIFE SEEMED TO MOUNT INTO MY BRAIN AT THE SIGHT OF THE RED COATS AND THE HEARING OF THAT MERRY MUSIC A LITTLE FARTHER ON
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THAT KIND IN HIS ADVENTURES AND IF THERE WASN'T THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOK AT THEM HOW FRANTICALLY THEY WHIRL THEIR GREAT ARMS JUST THE THING TO EXCITE THE CRAZY KNIGHT TO MORTAL COMBAT
KNEW NO BETTER THAN TO BE VENTURESOME WHY LET HIM TUMBLE HORROR WHAT MEAN THAT HEAVY CRASHING SOUND BEN COULD NOT STIR HE COULD ONLY GASP JACOB JACOB CRIED ANOTHER STARTLED VOICE
THIS APPEAL SEEMED TO PRODUCE SOME EFFECT FOR TWO OF THE FELLOWS BEGAN TO LOOK HERE AND THERE AMONG THE LUMBER BUT HALF HEARTEDLY I THOUGHT AND WITH HALF AN EYE TO THEIR OWN DANGER ALL THE TIME WHILE THE REST STOOD IRRESOLUTE ON THE ROAD
AT THIS PEW SAW HIS ERROR TURNED WITH A SCREAM AND RAN STRAIGHT FOR THE DITCH INTO WHICH HE ROLLED BUT HE WAS ON HIS FEET AGAIN IN A SECOND AND MADE ANOTHER DASH NOW UTTERLY BEWILDERED RIGHT UNDER THE NEAREST OF THE COMING HORSES
FOUR OR FIVE OF THEM OBEYED AT ONCE TWO REMAINING ON THE ROAD WITH THE FORMIDABLE BEGGAR THERE WAS A PAUSE THEN A CRY OF SURPRISE AND THEN A VOICE SHOUTING FROM THE HOUSE BILL'S DEAD
THE SAME WORLD RENOWNED RIVER DEGRADED FROM THE BEAUTIFUL FREE FLOWING RHINE SERVES AS A MOAT FROM THE RAMPART THAT SURROUNDS LEYDEN AND IS CROSSED BY DRAWBRIDGES AT THE IMPOSING GATEWAYS THAT GIVE ACCESS TO THE CITY
I WAS SCARCELY IN POSITION ERE MY ENEMIES BEGAN TO ARRIVE SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THEM RUNNING HARD THEIR FEET BEATING OUT OF TIME ALONG THE ROAD AND THE MAN WITH THE LANTERN SOME PACES IN FRONT THREE MEN RAN TOGETHER HAND IN HAND
THIS OVER THE PARTY ONCE MORE PREPARED FOR SKATING
WELL THEN HAWKINS WHAT IN FORTUNE WERE THEY AFTER MORE MONEY I SUPPOSE NO SIR NOT MONEY I THINK REPLIED I
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM SOME OTHER BUILDING AND HASTILY CLAPPED ON AS A FINISHING TOUCH
LEYDEN THE BOYS MET AT THE MUSEUM AND WERE SOON ENGAGED IN EXAMINING ITS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF CURIOSITIES RECEIVING A NEW INSIGHT INTO
SCATTER LADS AND FIND EM SURE ENOUGH THEY LEFT THEIR GLIM HERE SAID THE FELLOW FROM THE WINDOW SCATTER AND FIND EM ROUT THE HOUSE OUT REITERATED PEW STRIKING WITH HIS STICK UPON THE ROAD
NO ROAD LED UP TO IT NO SMOKE AROSE FROM ANY OF THE CHIMNEYS NOR WAS THERE ANY SEMBLANCE OF A GARDEN MY HEART SANK THAT I CRIED THE WOMAN'S FACE LIT UP WITH A MALIGNANT ANGER
THE TRAMP OF HORSES GALLOPING ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME A PISTOL SHOT FLASH AND REPORT CAME FROM THE HEDGE SIDE AND THAT WAS PLAINLY THE LAST SIGNAL OF DANGER FOR THE BUCCANEERS TURNED AT ONCE AND RAN
FINALLY HE TOOK A WRONG TURN AND RAN A FEW STEPS PAST ME TOWARDS THE HAMLET CRYING
AND FROM ITS EFFECT UPON THE BUCCANEERS A SIGNAL TO WARN THEM OF APPROACHING DANGER THERE'S DIRK AGAIN SAID ONE TWICE WE'LL HAVE TO BUDGE MATES
AND THEN RIGHT UP AGAINST THE YELLOW SKY I SAW A SCROLL OF SMOKE GO MOUNTING NOT MUCH THICKER AS IT SEEMED TO ME THAN THE SMOKE OF A CANDLE BUT STILL THERE IT WAS AND MEANT A FIRE AND WARMTH AND COOKERY
AND WE WALKED BACK TO THE HAMLET WHERE THE HORSES WERE
YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON THOUSANDS YOU FOOLS AND YOU HANG A LEG YOU'D BE AS RICH AS KINGS IF YOU COULD FIND IT AND YOU KNOW IT'S HERE AND YOU STAND THERE SKULKING THERE WASN'T ONE OF YOU DARED FACE BILL
SAID HE NOTHIN LEFT IT'S THESE PEOPLE OF THE INN IT'S THAT BOY I WISH I HAD PUT HIS EYES OUT CRIED THE BLIND MAN PEW
THE NEXT PERSON I CAME ACROSS WAS A DAPPER LITTLE MAN IN A BEAUTIFUL WHITE WIG WHOM I SAW TO BE A BARBER ON HIS ROUNDS AND KNOWING WELL THAT BARBERS WERE GREAT GOSSIPS I ASKED HIM PLAINLY WHAT SORT OF A MAN WAS MISTER BALFOUR OF THE SHAWS
THE FIRE AND THE BRIGHT LIGHTS WOULD SHOW A MILE AWAY AND THE DOOR OPEN TO A BEGGAR'S KNOCK I CAME FORWARD CAUTIOUSLY
STONE DEAD AS FOR MY MOTHER WHEN WE HAD CARRIED HER UP TO THE HAMLET A LITTLE COLD WATER AND SALTS AND THAT SOON BROUGHT HER BACK AGAIN AND SHE WAS NONE THE WORSE FOR HER TERROR
YET I SAW NO OTHER PRESENTLY IT BROUGHT ME TO STONE UPRIGHTS WITH AN UNROOFED LODGE BESIDE THEM AND COATS OF ARMS UPON THE TOP A MAIN ENTRANCE IT WAS PLAINLY MEANT TO BE BUT NEVER FINISHED INSTEAD OF GATES OF WROUGHT IRON
THAN THEY WERE IN THE FACT OF ITS BEING A TRIPTYCH THAT IS PAINTED ON THREE DIVISIONS THE TWO OUTER ONES SWUNG ON HINGES SO AS TO CLOSE WHEN REQUIRED OVER THE MAIN PORTION
HIM THEY HAD DESERTED WHETHER IN SHEER PANIC OR OUT OF REVENGE FOR HIS ILL WORDS AND BLOWS I KNOW NOT BUT THERE HE REMAINED BEHIND TAPPING UP AND DOWN THE ROAD IN A FRENZY AND GROPING AND CALLING FOR HIS COMRADES
ONE TAILING OUT BEHIND THE REST WAS A LAD THAT HAD GONE FROM THE HAMLET TO DOCTOR LIVESEY'S THE REST WERE REVENUE OFFICERS WHOM HE HAD MET BY THE WAY AND WITH WHOM HE HAD HAD THE INTELLIGENCE TO RETURN AT ONCE
THERE WAS A FLAG UPON THE CASTLE AND SHIPS MOVING OR LYING ANCHORED IN THE FIRTH BOTH OF WHICH FOR AS FAR AWAY AS THEY WERE I COULD DISTINGUISH CLEARLY AND BOTH BROUGHT MY COUNTRY HEART INTO MY MOUTH PRESENTLY AFTER
IT BEWILDERS ONE TO LOOK AT THEM HELP ME TO COUNT ALL THOSE WE CAN SEE VAN MOUNEN I WANT A BIG ITEM FOR MY NOTEBOOK AND AFTER A CAREFUL RECKONING
AND BATS FLEW IN AND OUT LIKE DOVES OUT OF A DOVE COTE THE NIGHT HAD BEGUN TO FALL AS I GOT CLOSE AND IN THREE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS WHICH WERE VERY HIGH UP AND NARROW AND WELL BARRED THE CHANGING LIGHT OF A LITTLE FIRE BEGAN TO GLIMMER
IN THE MEANTIME THE SUPERVISOR RODE ON AS FAST AS HE COULD TO KITT'S HOLE BUT HIS MEN HAD TO DISMOUNT AND GROPE DOWN THE DINGLE LEADING AND SOMETIMES SUPPORTING THEIR HORSES AND IN CONTINUAL FEAR OF AMBUSHES
CRIED THE VOICE SHARPLY I REPEATED WHAT I HAD SAID WHO ARE YE YOURSELF
WHAT KIND OF A GREAT HOUSE WAS THIS THAT ALL THE PARISH SHOULD START AND STARE TO BE ASKED THE WAY TO IT OR WHAT SORT OF A GENTLEMAN THAT HIS ILL FAME SHOULD BE THUS CURRENT ON THE WAYSIDE IF AN HOUR'S WALKING WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME BACK TO ESSENDEAN
I WAS IN TWO MINDS WHETHER TO RUN AWAY BUT ANGER GOT THE UPPER HAND AND I BEGAN INSTEAD TO RAIN KICKS AND BUFFETS ON THE DOOR
CRIES THE CARTER IN SO SHARP A NOTE THAT HIS VERY HORSE STARTED AND THEN WELL MANNIE HE ADDED IT'S NANE OF MY AFFAIRS BUT YE SEEM A DECENT SPOKEN LAD AND IF YE'LL TAKE A WORD FROM ME YE'LL KEEP CLEAR OF THE SHAWS
AND THE MEN CAME OUT AGAIN ONE AFTER ANOTHER ON THE ROAD AND DECLARED THAT WE WERE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
JUST THEN THE NOISE OF HORSES TOPPED THE RISE AND FOUR OR FIVE RIDERS CAME IN SIGHT IN THE MOONLIGHT AND SWEPT AT FULL GALLOP DOWN THE SLOPE
SAID A VOICE I HAVE COME HERE WITH A LETTER I SAID TO MISTER EBENEZER BALFOUR OF SHAWS IS HE HERE FROM WHOM IS IT ASKED THE MAN WITH THE BLUNDERBUSS THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE
WAS THIS THE PALACE I HAD BEEN COMING TO WAS IT WITHIN THESE WALLS THAT I WAS TO SEEK NEW FRIENDS AND BEGIN GREAT FORTUNES WHY IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE ON ESSEN WATERSIDE
BUT THE BOYS SPENT A FEW PLEASANT MOMENTS IN THE STADHUIS OR TOWN HALL A LONG IRREGULAR STRUCTURE SOMEWHAT IN THE GOTHIC STYLE UNCOUTH IN ARCHITECTURE BUT PICTURESQUE FROM AGE ITS LITTLE STEEPLE TUNEFUL WITH BELLS
IF YE SEE THE LAIRD TELL HIM WHAT YE HEAR TELL HIM THIS MAKES THE TWELVE HUNNER AND NINETEEN TIME THAT JENNET CLOUSTON HAS CALLED DOWN THE CURSE ON HIM AND HIS HOUSE BYRE AND STABLE MAN GUEST AND MASTER WIFE MISS OR BAIRN
SEPARATING IN EVERY DIRECTION ONE SEAWARD ALONG THE COVE ONE SLANT ACROSS THE HILL AND SO ON SO THAT IN HALF A MINUTE NOT A SIGN OF THEM REMAINED BUT PEW
RELICS OF THE DAYS WHEN THE COUNTRYMEN OF JULIUS CAESAR HAD SETTLED THERE WHERE HAVE THEY NOT SETTLED I FOR ONE WOULD HARDLY BE ASTONISHED IF RELICS OF THE ANCIENT ROMANS SHOULD SOMEDAY BE FOUND DEEP UNDER THE GRASS GROWING AROUND THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT
BUT AS THEY WERE NOT LEARNED MEN THEY COULD ONLY WALK ABOUT AND STARE ENJOY THE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF NATURAL HISTORY THEY POSSESSED AND WISH WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS THEY HAD ACQUIRED MORE EVEN THE SKELETON OF THE MOUSE PUZZLED JACOB WHAT WONDER
ASCENDED TO A HIGH MOUND WHICH STOOD IN THE CENTER THIS WAS THE SITE OF A ROUND TOWER NOW IN RUINS SAID BY SOME TO HAVE BEEN BUILT BY HENGIST THE ANGLO SAXON KING
AND WITH A CURIOUS CHANGE OF VOICE THAT THE NEXT QUESTION FOLLOWED
DOWN WENT THE STONE ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM AND LEFT ME SITTING HERE ON TOP WITH BOTH MY FEET IN THE AIR IF I HAD NOT THROWN MYSELF BACK AT THAT MOMENT I CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE ROLLED OVER AFTER THE STONE WELL IT IS NO MATTER
IN THOSE DAYS FOLK STILL BELIEVED IN WITCHES AND TREMBLED AT A CURSE AND THIS ONE FALLING SO PAT LIKE A WAYSIDE OMEN TO ARREST ME ERE I CARRIED OUT MY PURPOSE TOOK THE PITH OUT OF MY LEGS
HE INTERRUPTED VERY CHEERILY PERFECTLY RIGHT A GENTLEMAN AND A MAGISTRATE AND NOW I COME TO THINK OF IT I MIGHT AS WELL RIDE ROUND THERE MYSELF AND REPORT TO HIM OR SQUIRE MASTER PEW'S DEAD WHEN ALL'S DONE
AND BY OTHERS TO HAVE BEEN THE CASTLE OF ONE OF THE ANCIENT COUNTS OF HOLLAND AS THE BOYS WALKED ABOUT ON THE TOP OF ITS STONE WALL THEY COULD GET BUT A POOR VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING CITY
FILLED IT IN IMAGINATION WITH GAY SUMMER GROUPS HE TRIED TO FORGET OLD BATTLE CLOUDS AND PICTURE ONLY CURLING WREATHS OF TOBACCO SMOKE RISING FROM AMONG MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN ENJOYING THEIR TEA AND COFFEE IN THE OPEN AIR
AT THAT ANOTHER FELLOW PROBABLY HIM WHO HAD REMAINED BELOW TO SEARCH THE CAPTAIN'S BODY CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE INN
THAT IS THE HOUSE OF SHAWS SHE CRIED BLOOD BUILT IT BLOOD STOPPED THE BUILDING OF IT BLOOD SHALL BRING IT DOWN SEE HERE SHE CRIED AGAIN I SPIT UPON THE GROUND AND CRACK MY THUMB AT IT BLACK BE ITS FALL
WELL I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT WAS THERE WAS A BIG STONE LYING ON THE WALL AND I PUT MY MY FOOT OUT JUST TO PUSH IT A LITTLE YOU SEE AND THE FIRST THING I KNEW
MY CURIOSITY IN A SENSE WAS STRONGER THAN MY FEAR FOR I COULD NOT REMAIN WHERE I WAS BUT CREPT BACK TO THE BANK AGAIN WHENCE SHELTERING MY HEAD BEHIND A BUSH OF BROOM I MIGHT COMMAND THE ROAD BEFORE OUR DOOR
PROMPTLY AFTERWARDS FRESH SOUNDS OF ASTONISHMENT AROSE THE WINDOW OF THE CAPTAIN'S ROOM WAS THROWN OPEN WITH A SLAM AND A JINGLE OF BROKEN GLASS AND A MAN LEANED OUT INTO THE MOONLIGHT HEAD AND SHOULDERS AND ADDRESSED THE BLIND BEGGAR ON THE ROAD BELOW HIM
BUT WHEN I HAD COME SO FAR A WAY ALREADY MERE SHAME WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO DESIST TILL I HAD PUT THE MATTER TO THE TOUCH OF PROOF I WAS BOUND OUT OF MERE SELF RESPECT TO CARRY IT THROUGH AND LITTLE AS I LIKED THE SOUND OF WHAT I HEARD
THE CITY IS INTERSECTED BY NUMEROUS WATER ROADS FORMED BY THE RIVER RHINE THERE GROWN SLUGGISH FATIGUED BY ITS LONG TRAVEL BUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY STONE BRIDGES REUNITE THE DISSEVERED STREETS
AND ANOTHER READY TO FAINT BEN MANAGED TO TURN HIS HEAD HE SAW A CROWD OF BOYS ON THE EDGE OF THE WALL OPPOSITE BUT JACOB WAS NOT THERE GOOD HEAVENS HE CRIED SPRINGING FORWARD WHERE IS MY COUSIN
AND SHE WHEN I HAD PUT MY USUAL QUESTION TURNED SHARP ABOUT
I WAS IN FULL CAREER WHEN I HEARD THE COUGH RIGHT OVERHEAD AND JUMPING BACK AND LOOKING UP BEHELD A MAN'S HEAD IN A TALL NIGHTCAP AND THE BELL MOUTH OF A BLUNDERBUSS AT ONE OF THE FIRST STOREY WINDOWS IT'S LOADED
THE HOUSE IS A BIG MUCKLE HOUSE AY SAID I BUT THE FOLK THAT ARE IN IT FOLK CRIED HE
IT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY THE PRINCE OF ORANGE AS A TRIBUTE TO THE CITIZENS FOR THE BRAVERY DISPLAYED DURING THE SIEGE WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE GREAT MEN IN RELIGION LEARNING AND SCIENCE WHO HAD ONCE STUDIED THERE
THREATENED HIM IN HORRID TERMS AND TRIED IN VAIN TO CATCH THE STICK AND WREST IT FROM HIS GRASP THIS QUARREL WAS THE SAVING OF US FOR WHILE IT WAS STILL RAGING ANOTHER SOUND CAME FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL ON THE SIDE OF THE HAMLET
AND CATS IBEXES AND OTHER CREATURES THEY SAW A MASSIVE GOLD ARMLET THAT HAD BEEN WORN BY AN EGYPTIAN KING AT A TIME WHEN SOME OF THESE SAME MUMMIES PERHAPS WERE NIMBLY TREADING THE STREETS OF THEBES
HOOT HOOT HOOT SAID THE BARBER NAE KIND OF A MAN NAE KIND OF A MAN AT ALL AND BEGAN TO ASK ME VERY SHREWDLY WHAT MY BUSINESS WAS BUT I WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR HIM AT THAT
PETER AND JACOB REGARDED THE BUILDING WITH AN EVEN DEEPER MORE PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR THEY WERE TO ENTER IT AS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MONTHS POOR DON QUIXOTE WOULD HAVE RUN A HOPELESS TILT IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
IT SEEMED LIKE THE ONE WING OF A HOUSE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN FINISHED WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE INNER END STOOD OPEN ON THE UPPER FLOORS AND SHOWED AGAINST THE SKY WITH STEPS AND STAIRS OF UNCOMPLETED MASONRY MANY OF THE WINDOWS WERE UNGLAZED
I WAS SO MUCH SURPRISED AT THIS THAT I COULD FIND NO VOICE TO ANSWER BUT STOOD STARING AY THE MAN RESUMED HE'LL BE DEAD NO DOUBT AND THAT'LL BE WHAT BRINGS YE CHAPPING TO MY DOOR
AND HE WENT ON TO HIS NEXT CUSTOMER NO WISER THAN HE CAME I CANNOT WELL DESCRIBE THE BLOW THIS DEALT TO MY ILLUSIONS THE MORE INDISTINCT THE ACCUSATIONS WERE THE LESS I LIKED THEM FOR THEY LEFT THE WIDER FIELD TO FANCY
INTERESTED THEM FOR A WHILE AND BEN HAD TO BE ALMOST PULLED AWAY FROM THE DINGY OLD PORTRAIT OF VAN DER WERF THE TOWN HALL AS WELL AS THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM IS ON THE BREEDSTRAAT THE LONGEST AND FINEST STREET IN LEYDEN
PEW HE CRIED THEY'VE BEEN BEFORE US SOMEONE'S TURNED THE CHEST OUT ALOW AND ALOFT IS IT THERE ROARED PEW THE MONEY'S THERE THE BLIND MAN CURSED THE MONEY
SAID BEN AFTER LAMBERT HAD BEEN POINTING OUT SOME OF THE ODDITIES AND BEAUTIES OF THE SUBURBS IT IS ALL WINDMILLS YOU REMEMBER HIS TERRIFIC CONTEST WITH ONE I SUPPOSE NO SAID LAMBERT BLUNTLY
HE WAS NOT USED TO SEEING THE CAT FEARING LITTLE CREATURES RUNNING ABOUT IN THEIR BONES AND HOW COULD HE EVER HAVE IMAGINED THEIR NECKS TO BE SO QUEER BESIDES THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY THERE WAS SAINT PETER'S CHURCH TO BE VISITED
AND I DID IT A BLIND MAN AND I'M TO LOSE MY CHANCE FOR YOU I'M TO BE A POOR CRAWLING BEGGAR SPONGING FOR RUM WHEN I MIGHT BE ROLLING IN A COACH
SQUALLING WAS THE WORD FOR IT PEW'S ANGER ROSE SO HIGH AT THESE OBJECTIONS TILL AT LAST HIS PASSION COMPLETELY TAKING THE UPPER HAND HE STRUCK AT THEM RIGHT AND LEFT IN HIS BLINDNESS AND HIS STICK SOUNDED HEAVILY ON MORE THAN ONE
IT HAS NO CANAL RUNNING THROUGH IT AND THE HOUSES PAINTED IN EVERY VARIETY OF COLOR HAVE A PICTURESQUE EFFECT AS THEY STAND WITH THEIR GABLE ENDS TO THE STREET SOME ARE VERY TALL WITH HALF THEIR HEIGHT IN THEIR STEP LIKE ROOFS
BUT THE PAUSE WAS BRIEF FOR THE BLIND MAN AGAIN ISSUED HIS COMMANDS HIS VOICE SOUNDED LOUDER AND HIGHER AS IF HE WERE AFIRE WITH EAGERNESS AND RAGE IN IN IN HE SHOUTED AND CURSED THEM FOR THEIR DELAY
THEY MUST BE CLOSE BY THEY CAN'T BE FAR YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON IT SCATTER AND LOOK FOR THEM DOGS OH SHIVER MY SOUL HE CRIED
THEN GENTLY COLLAPSED UPON HIS FACE AND MOVED NO MORE I LEAPED TO MY FEET AND HAILED THE RIDERS THEY WERE PULLING UP AT ANY RATE
BUT A TRAGEDY CAME IN SPITE OF HIM POOT WAS BENDING OVER THE EDGE OF THE HIGH WALL IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE HIM TO GROW DIZZY AND TUMBLE OFF BEN TURNED IMPATIENTLY AWAY IF THE FELLOW WITH HIS WEAK HEAD
BUT THE BLIND MAN SWORE AT THEM AGAIN FOR THEIR DELAY SEARCH HIM SOME OF YOU SHIRKING LUBBERS AND THE REST OF YOU ALOFT AND GET THE CHEST HE CRIED I COULD HEAR THEIR FEET RATTLING UP OUR OLD STAIRS SO THAT THE HOUSE MUST HAVE SHOOK WITH IT
SIMPLEX SIGILLUM VERI THEY ALSO OBTAINED ADMITTANCE TO A TEA GARDEN WHICH IN SUMMER WAS A FAVORITE RESORT OF THE CITIZENS AND PASSING NAKED OAKS AND FRUIT TREES
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE PLAINNESS OF MY APPEARANCE IN MY COUNTRY HABIT AND THAT ALL DUSTY FROM THE ROAD CONSORTED ILL WITH THE GREATNESS OF THE PLACE TO WHICH I WAS BOUND BUT AFTER TWO OR MAYBE THREE HAD GIVEN ME THE SAME LOOK AND THE SAME ANSWER
AND AT THE SAME TIME A BULLET WHISTLED CLOSE BY HIS ARM SOON AFTER THE LUGGER DOUBLED THE POINT AND DISAPPEARED MISTER DANCE STOOD THERE AS HE SAID LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER
BEN AND LAMBERT HAD OFTEN VISITED THE BRITISH MUSEUM BUT THAT DID NOT PREVENT THEM FROM BEING SURPRISED AT THE RICHNESS OF THE LEYDEN COLLECTION THERE WERE HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS WEARING APPAREL WEAPONS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
WHAT DO YOU SEE AND FOR MONTHS HE COULD ONLY ANSWER NO HELP I SEE AROUND US NOTHING BUT THE ENEMY BEN PUSHED THESE THOUGHTS AWAY AND RESOLUTELY LOOKING DOWN INTO THE BARE TEA GARDEN
AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I SHOULD LIKE TO GET IT PUT IN SAFETY TO BE SURE BOY QUITE RIGHT SAID HE I'LL TAKE IT IF YOU LIKE I THOUGHT PERHAPS DOCTOR LIVESEY I BEGAN PERFECTLY RIGHT
SO IT WAS NO GREAT MATTER FOR SURPRISE THAT WHEN THEY GOT DOWN TO THE HOLE THE LUGGER WAS ALREADY UNDER WAY THOUGH STILL CLOSE IN HE HAILED HER A VOICE REPLIED TELLING HIM TO KEEP OUT OF THE MOONLIGHT OR HE WOULD GET SOME LEAD IN HIM
AND THOUGH NOTHING HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TAKEN AWAY EXCEPT THE CAPTAIN'S MONEY BAG AND A LITTLE SILVER FROM THE TILL I COULD SEE AT ONCE THAT WE WERE RUINED MISTER DANCE COULD MAKE NOTHING OF THE SCENE THEY GOT THE MONEY YOU SAY
CONTAINING PROFESSOR LUZAC'S MEMORIAL AND BOERHAAVE'S MONUMENT OF WHITE AND BLACK MARBLE WITH ITS URN AND CARVED SYMBOLS OF THE FOUR AGES OF LIFE AND ITS MEDALLION OF BOERHAAVE ADORNED WITH HIS FAVORITE MOTTO
WHEN THE BOYS LEFT THIS MUSEUM THEY WENT TO ANOTHER AND SAW A WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF FOSSIL ANIMALS SKELETONS BIRDS MINERALS PRECIOUS STONES AND OTHER NATURAL SPECIMENS
SAYS THE MAN THERE'S THE LAIRD TO BE SURE IF IT'S HIM YOU'RE WANTING WHAT'LL LIKE BE YOUR BUSINESS MANNIE I WAS LED TO THINK THAT I WOULD GET A SITUATION I SAID LOOKING AS MODEST AS I COULD WHAT
WHITEHALL WAS THROWN INTO CONFUSION BY THE NEWS THAT DICK TALBOT AS HE WAS COMMONLY CALLED HAD LAID A PLAN TO MURDER THE DUKE OF ORMOND THE BRAVO WAS SENT TO THE TOWER BUT IN A FEW DAYS
TO THINK VERY LIGHTLY OF THE BLOODSHED AND DEVASTATION INSEPARABLE FROM GREAT MARTIAL EXPLOITS AND THE HEART OF WILLIAM WAS STEELED NOT ONLY BY PROFESSIONAL INSENSIBILITY BUT BY THAT STERNER INSENSIBILITY
THE BLOOD RAN DOWN IN RIVULETS FOR A TIME THE CRIMINAL SHOWED A STRANGE CONSTANCY BUT AT LAST HIS STUBBORN FORTITUDE GAVE WAY HIS BELLOWINGS WERE FRIGHTFUL TO HEAR HE SWOONED SEVERAL TIMES BUT THE SCOURGE STILL CONTINUED TO DESCEND
HE ALLIED HIMSELF CLOSELY WITH CASTELMAINE DOVER AND ALBEVILLE THESE MEN CALLED WITH ONE VOICE FOR WAR ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH AND THE STATE
AND TO CREATE ANOTHER HOLLAND IN COUNTRIES BEYOND THE REACH OF THE TYRANNY OF FRANCE NO OBSTACLE WOULD THEN REMAIN TO CHECK THE PROGRESS OF THE HOUSE OF BOURBON A FEW YEARS AND THAT HOUSE MIGHT ADD TO ITS DOMINIONS
THERE WAS THE STATELY TOMB WHERE SLEPT THE GREAT POLITICIAN WHOSE BLOOD WHOSE NAME WHOSE TEMPERAMENT AND WHOSE GENIUS HE HAD INHERITED
WAS A SPELL WHICH HAD THROUGH THREE GENERATIONS CALLED FORTH THE AFFECTIONATE ENTHUSIASM OF BOORS AND ARTISANS THE DUTCH LANGUAGE WAS THE LANGUAGE OF HIS NURSERY AMONG THE DUTCH GENTRY HE HAD CHOSEN HIS EARLY FRIENDS
WERE NOW AS ANXIOUS TO SUPPORT ROCHESTER AS THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN TO SUPPORT HALIFAX ALL THE INFLUENCE OF BARILLON WAS EMPLOYED ON THE OTHER SIDE AND BARILLON WAS ASSISTED BY ANOTHER FRENCH AGENT
BROUGHT HIM SAFE TO LAND AND THAT ON TWENTY FIELDS OF BATTLE THE CANNON BALLS PASSED HIM BY TO RIGHT AND LEFT THE ARDOUR AND PERSEVERANCE WITH WHICH HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO HIS MISSION
AND WHO HAD BEEN REWARDED FOR HIS SERVICES WITH THE TITLE
IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO TRACE THE PROGRESS OF THE SENTIMENT WHICH GRADUALLY POSSESSED ITSELF OF WILLIAM'S WHOLE SOUL WHEN HE WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A BOY HIS COUNTRY HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY LEWIS IN OSTENTATIOUS DEFIANCE OF JUSTICE AND PUBLIC LAW
GREAT JOY IN DISTANT COUNTRIES WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE DIVINE JUSTICE HAD OVERTAKEN HIM ENGRAVINGS OF HIM LOOKING OUT FROM THE PILLORY AND WRITHING AT THE CART'S TAIL WERE CIRCULATED ALL OVER EUROPE AND EPIGRAMMATISTS IN MANY LANGUAGES
YET EVEN HIS AFFECTION FOR THE LAND OF HIS BIRTH WAS SUBORDINATE TO ANOTHER FEELING WHICH EARLY BECAME SUPREME IN HIS SOUL WHICH MIXED ITSELF WITH ALL HIS PASSIONS WHICH IMPELLED HIM TO MARVELLOUS ENTERPRISES WHICH SUPPORTED HIM
A TIME HAD ARRIVED AT WHICH IT WAS IMPORTANT TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY THAT THERE SHOULD BE ENTIRE CONCORD BETWEEN THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS TILL AFTER THE SUPPRESSION OF THE WESTERN INSURRECTION GRAVE CAUSES OF DISSENSION HAD SEPARATED WILLIAM
CONCEIVED A GREAT CONTEMPT FOR THE KING'S ABILITIES AND CHARACTER THE WORLD HE SAID HAD MUCH OVERRATED HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY WHO HAD LESS CAPACITY THAN CHARLES
THAT OATES WAS A BAD MAN IS NOT A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR THE GUILTY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS THE FIRST TO SUFFER THOSE HARDSHIPS WHICH ARE AFTERWARDS USED AS PRECEDENTS AGAINST THE INNOCENT THUS IT WAS IN THE PRESENT CASE
IT WAS IN THE AGONY OF THAT CONFLICT WHEN PEASANTS WERE FLYING IN TERROR BEFORE THE INVADERS WHEN HUNDREDS OF FAIR GARDENS AND PLEASURE HOUSES WERE BURIED BENEATH THE WAVES WHEN THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE STATES WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE FAINTING
PRESENTED A REMARKABLE CONTRAST TO WILLIAM SIMPLE IN TASTES UNGRACIOUS IN DEMEANOUR INDEFATIGABLE AND INTREPID IN WAR REGARDLESS OF ALL THE ORNAMENTAL BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE
LORAINE AND FLANDERS
HAPPILY FOR HIM HE WAS NOT PUT TO THE BAR TILL THE FIRST BURST OF POPULAR RAGE HAD SPENT ITSELF AND TILL THE CREDIT OF THE FALSE WITNESSES HAD BEEN BLOWN UPON HE HAD THEREFORE ESCAPED
THAT IF THEY DESIRED PEACE THEY MUST RESIGN THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND DO ANNUAL HOMAGE TO THE HOUSE OF BOURBON THE INJURED NATION DRIVEN TO DESPAIR HAD OPENED ITS DYKES
HE LOOKED ROUND FOR SUCCOUR AND LOOKED IN VAIN SPAIN WAS UNNERVED GERMANY DISTRACTED ENGLAND CORRUPTED NOTHING SEEMED LEFT TO THE YOUNG STADTHOLDER BUT TO PERISH SWORD IN HAND
THOUGH HE WAS AS YET IN CONFINEMENT ONLY FOR DEBT HE WAS PUT INTO IRONS BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE KING'S BENCH PRISON AND EVEN SO HE WAS WITH DIFFICULTY KEPT IN SAFE CUSTODY THE MASTIFF THAT GUARDED HIS DOOR WAS POISONED
OCCUPIED ORANGE DISMANTLED THE FORTIFICATIONS AND CONFISCATED THE REVENUES WILLIAM DECLARED ALOUD AT HIS TABLE BEFORE MANY PERSONS THAT HE WOULD MAKE THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING REPENT THE OUTRAGE
INTO WHICH MAN CAN ENTER WITH HIS FELLOW MEN AND OF MAKING INSTITUTIONS TO WHICH IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD LOOK WITH RESPECT AND CONFIDENCE INSTRUMENTS OF FRIGHTFUL WRONG AND OBJECTS OF GENERAL DISTRUST
HE HAD A GREAT WORK TO DO AND TILL IT WAS DONE NOTHING COULD HARM HIM THEREFORE IT WAS THAT
WAS DESIROUS TO MAKE HIS PUNISHMENT MORE SEVERE THAN THAT OF FELONS OR TRAITORS AND NOT MERELY TO PUT HIM TO DEATH BUT TO PUT HIM TO DEATH BY FRIGHTFUL TORMENTS HE WAS SENTENCED TO BE STRIPPED OF HIS CLERICAL HABIT TO BE PILLORIED IN PALACE YARD
WHICH IS THE EFFECT OF A SENSE OF DUTY THREE GREAT COALITIONS THREE LONG AND BLOODY WARS IN WHICH ALL EUROPE FROM THE VISTULA TO THE WESTERN OCEAN WAS IN ARMS ARE TO BE ASCRIBED TO HIS UNCONQUERABLE ENERGY
NOT TO COUNTENANCE THIS BAD MAN WHO HAD NOTHING TO RECOMMEND HIM EXCEPT HIS FINE PERSON AND HIS TASTE IN DRESS TALBOT WAS NOT ONLY WELCOME AT THE PALACE WHEN THE BOTTLE OR THE DICEBOX WAS GOING ROUND
EVEN WHILE THE PRAYER FOR THE DEPARTING WAS READ AT HIS BEDSIDE THAT FEELING WAS ENMITY TO FRANCE AND TO THE MAGNIFICENT KING WHO IN MORE THAN ONE SENSE
HE HAD SEEN WITH STILL DEEPER DISPLEASURE THE COUNTENANCE GIVEN BY A LARGE SECTION OF THAT PARTY TO THE PRETENSIONS OF MONMOUTH THE OPPOSITION IT SEEMED WISHED FIRST TO MAKE THE CROWN OF ENGLAND NOT WORTH THE WEARING
A PERSON WHO COUNTED THE STRIPES ON THE SECOND DAY SAID THAT THEY WERE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED THE BAD MAN ESCAPED WITH LIFE BUT SO NARROWLY THAT HIS IGNORANT AND BIGOTED ADMIRERS THOUGHT HIS RECOVERY MIRACULOUS
THE AMUSEMENTS THE ARCHITECTURE THE LANDSCAPE OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HAD TAKEN HOLD ON HIS HEART TO HER HE TURNED WITH CONSTANT FONDNESS FROM A PROUDER AND FAIRER RIVAL IN THE GALLERY OF WHITEHALL
AND THAT THE ONLY EFFECT OF OPPOSITION WOULD BE TO MAKE HIM A HARD MASTER EACH OF THE TWO PARTIES INTO WHICH THE COURT WAS DIVIDED HAD ZEALOUS FOREIGN ALLIES THE MINISTERS OF SPAIN OF THE EMPIRE AND OF THE STATES GENERAL
MIGHT PLACE A PRINCE OF HIS FAMILY ON THE THRONE OF POLAND MIGHT BE SOLE MASTER OF EUROPE FROM THE SCYTHIAN DESERTS TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND OF AMERICA FROM REGIONS NORTH OF THE TROPIC OF CANCER
TO BE WELL PAID FOR HIS SERVICES AND SUCCEEDED IN ACQUIRING PARTLY BY THE SALE OF HIS INFLUENCE PARTLY BY GAMBLING AND PARTLY BY PIMPING AN ESTATE OF THREE THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR FOR UNDER AN OUTWARD SHOW OF LEVITY PROFUSION
THE WITNESSES OF THE PLOT HE MAY WELL BE EXCUSED FOR HATING THEM
SWORE AT THE COOKS AND POSTILIONS AND ALMOST RAISED MOBS BY HIS INSOLENT RODOMONTADES THE REFORMATION HE TOLD THE PEOPLE HAD RUINED EVERYTHING BUT FINE TIMES WERE COMING
HIS ARMS FOLDED AND HIS HAT PULLED OVER HIS EYES IT WAS NOT IN ENGLAND ALONE THAT THESE EVENTS EXCITED STRONG INTEREST MILLIONS OF ROMAN CATHOLICS WHO KNEW NOTHING OF OUR INSTITUTIONS OR OF OUR FACTIONS
INFERIOR TO HIM IN STATION BUT FAR SUPERIOR IN ABILITIES BONREPAUX BARILLON WAS NOT WITHOUT PARTS AND POSSESSED IN LARGE MEASURE THE GRACES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHICH THEN DISTINGUISHED THE FRENCH GENTRY
HE WAS SENT TO LONDON CHARGED WITH SEVERAL SPECIAL COMMISSIONS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE HE WAS TO LAY THE GROUND FOR A TREATY OF COMMERCE HE WAS TO ASCERTAIN AND REPORT THE STATE OF THE ENGLISH FLEETS
TALBOT WAS DESCENDED FROM AN OLD NORMAN FAMILY WHICH HAD BEEN LONG SETTLED IN LEINSTER WHICH HAD THERE SUNK INTO DEGENERACY WHICH HAD ADOPTED THE MANNERS OF THE CELTS WHICH HAD LIKE THE CELTS ADHERED TO THE OLD RELIGION
WHICH IT IS FOR HIS INTEREST TO HIDE TALBOT RAISED BY JAMES TO THE EARLDOM OF TYRCONNEL HAD COMMANDED THE TROOPS IN IRELAND DURING THE NINE MONTHS
AND HIS ACCENT WAS THAT OF HIS NATIVE GASCONY BUT HIS STRONG SENSE HIS KEEN PENETRATION AND HIS LIVELY WIT EMINENTLY QUALIFIED HIM FOR HIS POST
TO REGIONS SOUTH OF THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN SUCH WAS THE PROSPECT WHICH LAY BEFORE WILLIAM WHEN FIRST HE ENTERED ON PUBLIC LIFE AND WHICH NEVER CEASED TO HAUNT HIM TILL HIS LATEST DAY THE FRENCH MONARCHY
AND DOCKYARDS AND HE WAS TO MAKE SOME OVERTURES TO THE HUGUENOT REFUGEES WHO IT WAS SUPPOSED
WHEREVER HE HAD APPEARED MEN HAD UNCOVERED THEIR HEADS TO HIM THE LIVES AND ESTATES OF THE MAGNATES OF THE REALM HAD BEEN AT HIS MERCY TIMES HAD NOW CHANGED
TWO BILLS OF INDICTMENT AGAINST HIM FOR PERJURY HAD BEEN FOUND BY THE GRAND JURY OF MIDDLESEX A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE DEATH OF CHARLES SOON AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE ELECTIONS THE TRIAL CAME ON AMONG THE UPPER AND MIDDLE CLASSES
THEY LOOKED DOWN ON THE PROTESTANT CHURCHES OF THE CONTINENT AND REGARDED EVERY LINE OF THEIR OWN LITURGY AND RUBRIC AS SCARCELY LESS SACRED THAN THE GOSPELS HIS OPINIONS TOUCHING THE METAPHYSICS OF THEOLOGY WERE CALVINISTIC
WHEN HE WAS UNBOUND IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD BORNE AS MUCH AS THE HUMAN FRAME CAN BEAR WITHOUT DISSOLUTION JAMES WAS ENTREATED TO REMIT THE SECOND FLOGGING HIS ANSWER WAS SHORT AND CLEAR HE SHALL GO THROUGH WITH IT IF HE HAS BREATH IN HIS BODY
COULD REALLY BE A COLDHEARTED FARSIGHTED SCHEMING SYCOPHANT YET SUCH A MAN WAS TALBOT IN TRUTH HIS HYPOCRISY WAS OF A FAR HIGHER AND RARER SORT
WHICH MIGHT MOVE EVEN A PLACABLE NATURE TO FIERCE AND LASTING RESENTMENT ONE SET OF MEN IN PARTICULAR HAD WITH A BASENESS AND CRUELTY BEYOND ALL EXAMPLE AND ALL DESCRIPTION ATTACKED HIS HONOUR AND HIS LIFE
MERCILESS FLOGGING SOON BECAME AN ORDINARY PUNISHMENT FOR POLITICAL MISDEMEANOURS OF NO VERY AGGRAVATED KIND
BY LAYING THE BLAME OF THE ACCIDENT ON HER MONKEY THESE STORIES WHICH IF THEY HAD BEEN TRUE WOULD NEVER HAVE PASSED THE LIPS OF ANY BUT THE BASEST OF MANKIND WERE PURE INVENTIONS TALBOT WAS SOON FORCED TO OWN THAT THEY WERE SO
AND EVEN FOR REPRIMANDS FROM VERSAILLES
AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO OBTAIN THE QUEEN'S INTERCESSION BUT SHE INDIGNANTLY REFUSED TO SAY A WORD IN FAVOUR OF SUCH A WRETCH AFTER AN INTERVAL OF ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS OATES WAS AGAIN BROUGHT OUT OF HIS DUNGEON HE WAS UNABLE TO STAND
THAT THE FATHER OF A LARGE FAMILY WOULD RATHER BE BEREAVED OF ALL HIS CHILDREN BY ACCIDENT OR BY DISEASE THAN LOSE ONE OF THEM BY THE HANDS OF THE HANGMAN MURDER BY FALSE TESTIMONY IS THEREFORE THE MOST AGGRAVATED SPECIES OF MURDER
THE DOORS OF THE PRISON CLOSED UPON HIM DURING MANY MONTHS HE REMAINED IRONED IN THE DARKEST HOLE OF NEWGATE IT WAS SAID THAT IN HIS CELL HE GAVE HIMSELF UP TO MELANCHOLY AND SATE WHOLE DAYS UTTERING DEEP GROANS
THOUGH PURSUING ONE OBJECT VERY JUDICIOUSLY TOOK DIFFERENT PATHS THEY MADE A PARTITION OF THE COURT BONREPAUX LIVED CHIEFLY WITH ROCHESTER AND ROCHESTER'S ADHERENTS BARILLON'S CONNECTIONS
AND HE OWNED IT WITHOUT A BLUSH THE INJURED LADY BECAME DUCHESS OF YORK HAD HER HUSBAND BEEN A MAN REALLY UPRIGHT AND HONOURABLE HE WOULD HAVE DRIVEN FROM HIS PRESENCE WITH INDIGNATION AND CONTEMPT THE WRETCHES WHO HAD SLANDERED HER
HE RECOVERED FROM MALADIES WHICH SEEMED HOPELESS THAT BANDS OF ASSASSINS CONSPIRED IN VAIN AGAINST HIS LIFE THAT THE OPEN SKIFF TO WHICH HE TRUSTED HIMSELF ON A STARLESS NIGHT ON A RAGING OCEAN AND NEAR A TREACHEROUS SHORE
AND FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE THEOLOGY OF GENEVA THE ENEMIES DID NOT LONG OBSERVE THOSE COURTESIES WHICH MEN OF THEIR RANK EVEN WHEN OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER AT THE HEAD OF ARMIES SELDOM NEGLECT WILLIAM INDEED
FOR HE NEVER BECAME AN ENGLISHMAN HE SAVED ENGLAND IT IS TRUE BUT HE NEVER LOVED HER AND HE NEVER OBTAINED HER LOVE TO HIM SHE WAS ALWAYS A LAND OF EXILE VISITED WITH RELUCTANCE AND QUITTED WITH DELIGHT
TO PAINS SO EXCRUCIATING THAT THEY WITH UNFEIGNED EARNESTNESS BEGGED TO BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL ON CAPITAL CHARGES AND SENT TO THE GALLOWS HAPPILY THE PROGRESS OF THIS GREAT EVIL WAS SPEEDILY STOPPED BY THE REVOLUTION
AND OATES HAD BEEN GUILTY OF MANY SUCH MURDERS NEVERTHELESS THE PUNISHMENT WHICH WAS INFLICTED UPON HIM CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED IN SENTENCING HIM TO BE STRIPPED OF HIS ECCLESIASTICAL HABIT AND IMPRISONED FOR LIFE THE JUDGES EXCEEDED THEIR LEGAL POWER
AND THE LOUD WEEPING OF ANCIENT SENATORS WHO COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF SURVIVING THE FREEDOM AND GLORY OF THEIR NATIVE LAND THAT WILLIAM HAD BEEN CALLED TO THE HEAD OF AFFAIRS FOR A TIME IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT RESISTANCE WAS HOPELESS
WHO WAS THE SERVANT OF A CONFEDERACY OF TRADING TOWNS AND TO EVERY MARK OF CONTEMPT THE DAUNTLESS STADTHOLDER REPLIED BY A FRESH DEFIANCE WILLIAM TOOK HIS TITLE
HE PINED FOR THE FAMILIAR HOUSE IN THE WOOD AT THE HAGUE AND NEVER WAS SO HAPPY AS WHEN HE COULD QUIT THE MAGNIFICENCE OF WINDSOR FOR HIS FAR HUMBLER SEAT AT LOO DURING HIS SPLENDID BANISHMENT
BUT HIS CAPACITY WAS SCARCELY EQUAL TO WHAT HIS GREAT PLACE REQUIRED HE HAD BECOME SLUGGISH AND SELF INDULGENT LIKED THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY AND OF THE TABLE BETTER THAN BUSINESS AND ON GREAT EMERGENCIES
BUT WITHOUT FEELING A STRONG PREDILECTION FOR EITHER SIDE NOR IN TRUTH DID HE EVER TO THE END OF HIS LIFE BECOME EITHER A WHIG OR A TORY HE WANTED THAT WHICH IS THE COMMON GROUNDWORK OF BOTH CHARACTERS
EVEN IN THE MOST ATROCIOUS CASES ILL BECOMES THE JUDICIAL CHARACTER HE BETRAYED HOWEVER NO SIGN OF FEAR OR OF SHAME AND FACED THE STORM OF INVECTIVE WHICH BURST UPON HIM FROM BAR BENCH AND WITNESS BOX
TALBOT CONTINUED TO FREQUENT THE COURT APPEARED DAILY WITH BRAZEN FRONT BEFORE THE PRINCESS WHOSE RUIN HE HAD PLOTTED AND WAS INSTALLED INTO THE LUCRATIVE POST OF CHIEF PANDAR TO HER HUSBAND IN NO LONG TIME
HE FOUGHT ONE OF THE MOST BLOODY AND OBSTINATE BATTLES OF THAT AGE FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE TREATY OF NIMEGUEN WAS SIGNED
BUT WAS HEARD WITH ATTENTION ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS HE AFFECTED THE CHARACTER OF AN IRISH PATRIOT AND PLEADED WITH GREAT AUDACITY AND SOMETIMES WITH SUCCESS THE CAUSE OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WHOSE ESTATES HAD BEEN CONFISCATED HE TOOK CARE HOWEVER
HIS OPINIONS RESPECTING ECCLESIASTICAL POLITY AND MODES OF WORSHIP WERE LATITUDINARIAN HE OWNED THAT EPISCOPACY WAS A LAWFUL AND CONVENIENT FORM OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT BUT HE SPOKE WITH SHARPNESS AND SCORN OF THE BIGOTRY OF THOSE
HIS SKILL IN MARITIME AFFAIRS RECOMMENDED HIM TO JAMES WHO HAD DURING MANY YEARS PAID CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE BUSINESS OF THE ADMIRALTY AND UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS AS WELL AS HE WAS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING
HE WAS BROUGHT FORTH TO UNDERGO HIS FIRST FLOGGING AT AN EARLY HOUR AN INNUMERABLE MULTITUDE FILLED ALL THE STREETS FROM ALDGATE TO THE OLD BAILEY THE HANGMAN LAID ON THE LASH WITH SUCH UNUSUAL SEVERITY AS SHOWED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
NEWCASTLE WAS LIGHTED UP WITH GREAT PILES OF COAL
THOUGH INCLOSED ON EVERY SIDE BY THE FRENCH TERRITORY WAS PROPERLY A FIEF NOT OF THE FRENCH BUT OF THE IMPERIAL CROWN LEWIS WITH THAT OSTENTATIOUS CONTEMPT OF PUBLIC LAW WHICH WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM
IN SPITE OF EVERY DISADVANTAGE OF BIRTH AND FIGURE HE WAS SOON KNOWN AS A MOST PLEASING COMPANION AND AS A MOST SKILFUL DIPLOMATIST HE CONTRIVED WHILE FLIRTING WITH THE DUCHESS OF MAZARIN
HIS CONTEST WITH LEWIS TRANSFERRED FROM THE FIELD TO THE CABINET WAS SOON EXASPERATED BY A PRIVATE FEUD IN TALENTS TEMPER MANNERS AND OPINIONS THE RIVALS WERE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER
ONE OF THESE WAS ROGER PALMER EARL OF CASTELMAINE IN IRELAND AND HUSBAND OF THE DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND HIS TITLE HAD NOTORIOUSLY BEEN PURCHASED BY HIS WIFE'S DISHONOUR AND HIS OWN HIS FORTUNE WAS SMALL HIS TEMPER
THE WORST FELON COULD ONLY BE HANGED THE JUDGES AS THEY BELIEVED SENTENCED OATES TO BE SCOURGED TO DEATH THAT THE LAW WAS DEFECTIVE IS NOT A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR DEFECTIVE LAWS SHOULD BE ALTERED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND NOT STRAINED BY THE TRIBUNALS
TO BE LED ROUND WESTMINSTER HALL WITH AN INSCRIPTION DECLARING HIS INFAMY OVER HIS HEAD TO BE PILLORIED AGAIN IN FRONT OF THE ROYAL EXCHANGE TO BE WHIPPED FROM ALDGATE TO NEWGATE AND AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWO DAYS
IN NORTHUMBERLAND THE TRIUMPH OF SIR JOHN FENWICK A COURTIER WHOSE NAME AFTERWARDS OBTAINED A MELANCHOLY CELEBRITY WAS ATTENDED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EXCITED INTEREST IN LONDON
WAS TO WALLACE RELIGION GAVE HER SANCTION TO THAT INTENSE AND UNQUENCHABLE ANIMOSITY HUNDREDS OF CALVINISTIC PREACHERS PROCLAIMED THAT THE SAME POWER WHICH HAD SET APART SAMSON FROM THE WOMB
ONE OF THEM THE EARL OF HUNTINGDON BITTERLY REPROACHED HIM WITH HAVING DECEIVED THE HOUSES AND DRAWN ON THEM THE GUILT OF SHEDDING INNOCENT BLOOD THE JUDGES BROWBEAT AND REVILED THE PRISONER WITH AN INTEMPERANCE WHICH
WHEN SINKING UNDER MORTIFICATION PAIN SICKNESS AND SORROW WHICH TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF HIS CAREER SEEMED DURING A SHORT TIME TO LANGUISH BUT WHICH SOON BROKE FORTH AGAIN FIERCER THAN EVER AND CONTINUED TO ANIMATE HIM
HAD HEARD THAT A PERSECUTION OF SINGULAR BARBARITY HAD RAGED IN OUR ISLAND AGAINST THE PROFESSORS OF THE TRUE FAITH THAT MANY PIOUS MEN HAD SUFFERED MARTYRDOM AND THAT TITUS OATES HAD BEEN THE CHIEF MURDERER THERE WAS THEREFORE
AND ON THE VERY NIGHT PRECEDING THE TRIAL A LADDER OF ROPES WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE CELL
SET HIM DOWN FOR THE WILDEST OF LIBERTINES THE MULTITUDE WAS UNABLE TO CONCEIVE THAT A MAN WHO EVEN WHEN SOBER WAS MORE FURIOUS AND BOASTFUL THAN OTHERS WHEN THEY WERE DRUNK
HIS LEGS UNEVEN THE VULGAR SAID AS THOSE OF A BADGER HIS FOREHEAD LOW AS THAT OF A BABOON HIS PURPLE CHEEKS AND HIS MONSTROUS LENGTH OF CHIN HAD BEEN FAMILIAR TO ALL WHO FREQUENTED THE COURTS OF LAW HE HAD THEN BEEN THE IDOL OF THE NATION
THAT HE OWED IT TO HIS RELIGION AND TO THE DIGNITY OF HIS CROWN TO STAND FIRM AGAINST THE OUTCRY OF HERETICAL DEMAGOGUES AND TO LET THE PARLIAMENT SEE FROM THE FIRST THAT HE WOULD BE MASTER IN SPITE OF OPPOSITION
BUT AGE AND DISEASE HAD MADE NO ESSENTIAL CHANGE IN HIS CHARACTER AND MANNERS HE STILL WHENEVER HE OPENED HIS MOUTH
THE WORST OF MURDERERS TO THE GUILT OF SHEDDING INNOCENT BLOOD
WHO THOUGHT EPISCOPAL ORDINATION ESSENTIAL TO A CHRISTIAN SOCIETY HE HAD NO SCRUPLE ABOUT THE VESTMENTS AND GESTURES PRESCRIBED BY THE BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER BUT HE AVOWED THAT HE SHOULD LIKE THE RITES OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND BETTER
STILL REGARDED HIM AS A PUBLIC BENEFACTOR THESE PEOPLE WELL KNEW THAT IF HE WERE CONVICTED HIS SENTENCE WOULD BE ONE OF EXTREME SEVERITY AND WERE THEREFORE INDEFATIGABLE IN THEIR ENDEAVOURS TO MANAGE AN ESCAPE
AND THEN TO PLACE IT ON THE HEAD OF A BASTARD AND IMPOSTOR AT THE SAME TIME THE PRINCE'S RELIGIOUS SYSTEM DIFFERED WIDELY FROM THAT WHICH WAS THE BADGE OF THE TORIES THEY WERE ARMINIANS AND PRELATISTS
AND WAS EAGER TO RETRIEVE HIS FALLEN FORTUNES BY MEANS OF LUCRATIVE POSTS
THAT THEY WOULD THANKFULLY ACCEPT ALMOST ANY TERMS OF RECONCILIATION THE NEW ENVOY'S ORIGIN WAS PLEBEIAN HIS STATURE WAS DWARFISH HIS COUNTENANCE WAS LUDICROUSLY UGLY
EVEN WHEN HE RENDERED TO HER THOSE SERVICES OF WHICH AT THIS DAY WE FEEL THE HAPPY EFFECTS HER WELFARE WAS NOT HIS CHIEF OBJECT WHATEVER PATRIOTIC FEELING HE HAD WAS FOR HOLLAND
OATES HAD FEW FRIENDS LEFT THE MOST RESPECTABLE WHIGS WERE NOW CONVINCED THAT EVEN IF HIS NARRATIVE HAD SOME FOUNDATION IN FACT HE HAD ERECTED ON THAT FOUNDATION A VAST SUPERSTRUCTURE OF ROMANCE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF LOW FANATICS HOWEVER
SECURE OF PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT HE MIGHT NOW INDULGE IN THE LUXURY OF REVENGE HIS NATURE WAS NOT PLACABLE AND WHILE STILL A SUBJECT HE HAD SUFFERED SOME INJURIES AND INDIGNITIES
THEY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY COMPETENT TO INFLICT WHIPPING NOR HAD THE LAW ASSIGNED A LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF STRIPES BUT THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW CLEARLY WAS THAT NO MISDEMEANOUR SHOULD BE PUNISHED MORE SEVERELY THAN THE MOST ATROCIOUS FELONIES
A SPIRIT AS FIERCE AND DETERMINED AS HIS OWN AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT
THE PROLONGED MENTAL AGONY OF THE SUFFERER THE SHAME AND MISERY OF ALL CONNECTED WITH HIM THE STAIN ABIDING EVEN TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION ARE THINGS FAR MORE DREADFUL THAN DEATH ITSELF IN GENERAL IT MAY BE SAFELY AFFIRMED
BUT ONE OF THE PECULIARITIES OF JAMES'S CHARACTER WAS THAT NO ACT HOWEVER WICKED AND SHAMEFUL WHICH HAD BEEN PROMPTED BY A DESIRE TO GAIN HIS FAVOUR EVER SEEMED TO HIM DESERVING OF DISAPPROBATION
AND WHICH HAD TAKEN PART WITH THE CELTS IN THE REBELLION OF SIXTEEN FORTY ONE IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST NOTED SHARPERS AND BULLIES OF LONDON HE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO CHARLES AND JAMES WHEN THEY WERE EXILES IN FLANDERS
LEWIS POLITE AND DIGNIFIED PROFUSE AND VOLUPTUOUS FOND OF DISPLAY AND AVERSE FROM DANGER A MUNIFICENT PATRON OF ARTS AND LETTERS AND A CRUEL PERSECUTOR OF CALVINISTS
WAS TO HIM WHAT THE ROMAN REPUBLIC WAS TO HANNIBAL WHAT THE OTTOMAN POWER WAS TO SCANDERBEG
THE CATHOLICS WOULD SOON BE UPPERMOST THE HERETICS SHOULD PAY FOR ALL RAVING AND BLASPHEMING INCESSANTLY LIKE A DEMONIAC
AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO DRAG HIM TO TYBURN ON A SLEDGE
AND WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THESE WORDS BY THE COUNT OF AVAUX POSITIVELY REFUSED EITHER TO RETRACT THEM OR TO EXPLAIN THEM AWAY
IMPROVIDENCE AND ECCENTRIC IMPUDENCE HE WAS IN TRUTH ONE OF THE MOST MERCENARY AND CRAFTY OF MANKIND HE WAS NOW NO LONGER YOUNG AND WAS EXPIATING BY SEVERE SUFFERINGS THE DISSOLUTENESS OF HIS YOUTH
WERE CHIEFLY WITH THE OPPOSITE FACTION THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THEY SOMETIMES SAW THE SAME EVENT IN DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW
WESTMINSTER HALL WAS CROWDED WITH SPECTATORS AMONG WHOM WERE MANY ROMAN CATHOLICS
HENRY JERMYN WHOM JAMES HAD LATELY CREATED A PEER BY THE TITLE OF LORD DOVER JERMYN HAD BEEN DISTINGUISHED MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS BEFORE BY HIS VAGRANT AMOURS AND HIS DESPERATE DUELS HE WAS NOW RUINED BY PLAY
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN LAMP WICK STOPPED LAUGHING HE TOTTERED AND ALMOST FELL PALE AS A GHOST HE TURNED TO PINOCCHIO AND SAID
COME WITH US AND WE'LL ALWAYS BE HAPPY SHOUTED THE ONE HUNDRED AND MORE BOYS IN THE WAGON ALL TOGETHER AND IF I GO WITH YOU WHAT WILL MY GOOD FAIRY SAY ASKED
THAN DONE HE APPROACHED THE FIRST DONKEY AND TRIED TO MOUNT IT BUT THE LITTLE ANIMAL TURNED SUDDENLY AND GAVE HIM SUCH A TERRIBLE KICK IN THE STOMACH THAT PINOCCHIO WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND AND FELL WITH HIS LEGS IN THE AIR AT THIS UNLOOKED FOR ENTERTAINMENT
WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THAT MARVELOUS COUNTRY
SAID PINOCCHIO BUT FROM NOW ON I OBEY
LITTLE DORMOUSE VERY VERY SICK AND FROM AN ILLNESS WHICH FRIGHTENS ME DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO FEEL THE PULSE A LITTLE FEEL MINE THEN AND TELL ME IF I HAVE A FEVER
IN ORDER TO GIVE ALL THEIR TIME TO NONSENSE AND PLEASURE SOONER OR LATER COME TO GRIEF
IS COMPOSED OF SIX SATURDAYS AND ONE SUNDAY VERY SURE AND THAT
IN SUDDEN DETERMINATION HE SAID HURRIEDLY GOOD BY FOR THE LAST TIME AND GOOD LUCK GOOD BY HOW SOON WILL YOU GO WITHIN TWO HOURS
BLOWING OF TRUMPETS THAT IT WAS DEAFENING EVERYWHERE GROUPS OF BOYS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER SOME PLAYED AT MARBLES AT HOPSCOTCH AT BALL OTHERS RODE ON BICYCLES OR ON WOODEN HORSES SOME PLAYED AT
COTTON BAG ON HIS HEAD
AND WHO HAS BEEN SO KIND TO ME AND BY THIS TIME I
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD THE NEWS DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT GOOD LUCK IS MINE WHAT IS IT TOMORROW I END MY DAYS AS A MARIONETTE AND BECOME A BOY LIKE YOU AND ALL MY OTHER FRIENDS
I WONDER IF HE TOO HAS DONKEY FEVER BUT PRETENDING HE HAD SEEN NOTHING HE ASKED WITH A SMILE HOW ARE YOU MY DEAR LAMP WICK VERY WELL
I LEAVE YOU TO THINK OF THE TERRIBLE GRIEF THE SHAME THE DESPAIR OF THE POOR MARIONETTE HE BEGAN TO CRY TO SCREAM TO KNOCK HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL
THE SQUARES WERE FILLED WITH SMALL WOODEN THEATERS OVERFLOWING WITH BOYS FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND ON THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES
IN CASE YOU DO DISOBEY YOU WILL BE THE ONE TO SUFFER NOT ANYONE ELSE WHY BECAUSE BOYS WHO DO NOT LISTEN TO THEIR ELDERS ALWAYS COME TO GRIEF
SAID LAMP WICK ARE YOU GOING ALONE OR WITH OTHERS ALONE THERE WILL BE MORE THAN A HUNDRED OF US WILL YOU WALK AT MIDNIGHT THE WAGON PASSES HERE THAT IS TO TAKE US
I OH NO
THE WHOLE COMPANY OF RUNAWAYS LAUGHED UPROARIOUSLY THE LITTLE FAT MAN DID NOT LAUGH HE WENT UP TO THE REBELLIOUS ANIMAL AND STILL SMILING BENT OVER HIM LOVINGLY AND
INCHES YOU MUST KNOW
NEVER MIND ANSWERED LAMP WICK IF THERE'S NO ROOM INSIDE
AND STILL OTHERS A MIXTURE OF BROWN AND BLACK HERE AND THERE WERE A FEW WITH LARGE YELLOW AND BLUE STRIPES THE STRANGEST THING OF ALL WAS THAT
BUT THE MOST HORRIBLE MOMENT WAS THE ONE IN WHICH THE TWO POOR CREATURES FELT THEIR TAILS APPEAR OVERCOME WITH SHAME AND GRIEF THEY TRIED TO CRY AND BEMOAN THEIR FATE
WAS TO BE BUTTERED ON BOTH SIDES THEY ALL ENDED BY ACCEPTING THE INVITATION WITH THE WORDS
BUT STILL WITHOUT SUCCESS
THOSE TWENTY FOUR DONKEYS INSTEAD OF BEING IRON SHOD
SANG SLEEPILY BETWEEN HIS TEETH AFTER A MILE OR SO PINOCCHIO AGAIN HEARD THE SAME FAINT VOICE WHISPERING REMEMBER LITTLE SIMPLETON
AND FOUND A GREAT SURPRISE AWAITING HIM A SURPRISE WHICH MADE HIM FEEL VERY UNHAPPY
AND THIN AND HAD A WOEBEGONE LOOK ABOUT HIM LAMP WICK WAS THE LAZIEST BOY IN THE SCHOOL AND THE BIGGEST MISCHIEF MAKER BUT PINOCCHIO LOVED HIM DEARLY
AFTER A FULL HALF HOUR THE DOOR OPENED ANOTHER SURPRISE AWAITED PINOCCHIO THERE IN THE ROOM STOOD HIS FRIEND WITH A LARGE
HOW WELL I CAN PROVE IT TO YOU A DAY WILL COME
WHAT A GREAT LAND SAID PINOCCHIO FEELING HIS MOUTH WATER WHAT A BEAUTIFUL LAND I HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE BUT I CAN WELL IMAGINE IT WHY DON'T YOU COME TOO
WHICH IS COMING TO GET ME FOR THE LAST TIME ARE YOU COMING OR NOT BUT IS IT REALLY TRUE THAT IN THAT COUNTRY BOYS NEVER HAVE TO STUDY
TO A REAL COUNTRY THE BEST IN THE WORLD A WONDERFUL PLACE
AND REASONABLE PINOCCHIO MOUNTED AND THE WAGON STARTED ON ITS WAY WHILE THE DONKEYS GALLOPED ALONG THE STONY ROAD
PINOCCHIO WALKED TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM BUT WHEN HE REACHED IT REMEMBERING HIS DONKEY EARS
NEVER NEVER
IN DESPERATION HE RETURNED HOME AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR WHO IS IT ASKED LAMP WICK FROM WITHIN IT IS I
IN THE DISTANCE A SMALL LIGHT FLICKERED A QUEER SOUND COULD BE HEARD SOFT AS A LITTLE BELL AND FAINT AND MUFFLED LIKE THE
IN THE MEANTIME PINOCCHIO LIFTED HIMSELF UP FROM THE GROUND AND WITH ONE LEAP LANDED ON THE DONKEY'S BACK THE LEAP WAS SO WELL TAKEN THAT ALL THE BOYS SHOUTED HURRAH FOR PINOCCHIO
PINOCCHIO SEARCHED HERE AND THERE AND EVERYWHERE AND FINALLY DISCOVERED HIM HIDING
THE DORMOUSE TOOK PINOCCHIO'S WRIST BETWEEN HER PAWS AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES LOOKED UP AT HIM SORROWFULLY AND SAID MY FRIEND
THE BOYS SLEPT LAMP WICK SNORED LIKE A DORMOUSE
AT TAG HERE A GROUP
FATE HAS DECREED THAT
DURING WHICH TIME THE TWO FRIENDS
ENJOY OURSELVES AND BE HAPPY FROM MORN TILL NIGHT AND WHY DID YOU FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF THAT FALSE FRIEND WHY
I'LL WALK
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS STUDY HERE IT IS ONLY ON SATURDAYS THAT WE HAVE NO SCHOOL IN THE LAND OF TOYS EVERY DAY EXCEPT SUNDAY IS A SATURDAY
ASKED PINOCCHIO RUNNING UP TO HIM I AM WAITING FOR MIDNIGHT TO STRIKE TO GO WHERE FAR FAR AWAY AND I HAVE GONE TO YOUR HOUSE THREE TIMES TO LOOK FOR YOU
AND CLAPPED THEIR HANDS IN HEARTY APPLAUSE SUDDENLY THE LITTLE DONKEY GAVE A KICK WITH HIS TWO HIND FEET AND AT THIS UNEXPECTED MOVE
KNOW THEN THAT WITHIN TWO OR THREE HOURS YOU WILL NO LONGER BE A MARIONETTE NOR A BOY WHAT SHALL I BE

TURNING ONCE MORE TO HIS FRIEND
FONDLY EMBRACING HIS FRIEND FIVE MONTHS PASSED AND THE BOYS CONTINUED PLAYING

THAT IN A FEW HOURS THEY WOULD REACH A COUNTRY WHERE THERE WERE NO SCHOOLS NO BOOKS NO TEACHERS MADE THESE BOYS SO HAPPY THAT THEY FELT NEITHER HUNGER NOR THIRST
THEY BECAME EVERYBODY'S FRIEND WHO COULD BE HAPPIER THAN THEY WHAT WITH ENTERTAINMENTS AND PARTIES THE HOURS THE DAYS THE WEEKS PASSED LIKE LIGHTNING OH
LIKE A BOX OF SARDINES THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE THEY WERE PILED ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER THEY COULD HARDLY BREATHE YET NOT ONE WORD OF COMPLAINT WAS HEARD THE THOUGHT
VACATION BEGINS ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY AND ENDS ON THE LAST DAY OF DECEMBER
WE SHALL SEE IF YOU ARE TELLING THE TRUTH
LET HIM WEEP
IN A MOCKING WAY FINALLY
THEIR ARMS TURNED INTO LEGS THEIR FACES LENGTHENED INTO SNOUTS AND THEIR BACKS BECAME COVERED WITH LONG GRAY HAIRS THIS WAS HUMILIATION ENOUGH
NOR SLEEP NOR DISCOMFORT NO SOONER HAD THE WAGON STOPPED THAN THE LITTLE FAT MAN TURNED TO LAMP WICK WITH BOWS AND SMILES HE ASKED IN A WHEEDLING TONE
BECOME LIKE THOSE OF A DONKEY IN A LITTLE WHILE HE CHANGES INTO A REAL DONKEY AND BEGINS TO BRAY EVERYONE AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER

MAY THAT BRING YOU LUCK PINOCCHIO LAMP WICK CALLED OUT
TWICE A THIRD TIME FINALLY HE SAID
HE LOOKED FOR LAMP WICK EVERYWHERE ALONG THE STREETS IN THE SQUARES INSIDE THE THEATRES EVERYWHERE BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND HE ASKED EVERYONE

FOR ITS WHEELS WERE BOUND WITH STRAW AND RAGS IT WAS DRAWN BY TWELVE PAIR OF DONKEYS ALL OF THE SAME SIZE BUT ALL OF DIFFERENT COLOR SOME WERE GRAY OTHERS WHITE
YOURS FIRST THEN MINE WELL THEN
BEGINNING TO WAVER AND WEAKEN IN HIS GOOD RESOLUTIONS
THEY ENDED BY BURSTING OUT INTO HEARTY LAUGHTER THEY LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AND LAUGHED
AND WITH ONE LEAP HE PERCHED HIMSELF THERE
I AM THE LITTLE MAN
OH MY POOR PINOCCHIO OH MY POOR LAMP WICK AN EMBARRASSINGLY LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED THESE WORDS
THERE HE SAW WHAT HE NEVER COULD HAVE WISHED TO SEE HIS MANLY FIGURE WAS ADORNED AND ENRICHED BY A BEAUTIFUL PAIR OF DONKEY'S EARS
WE'LL COME TO PLEASE YOU NOW IT MUST BE KNOWN THAT AMONG ALL HIS FRIENDS PINOCCHIO HAD ONE WHOM HE LOVED MOST OF ALL
AND THEN A SCENE TOOK PLACE WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE BUT IT IS ALL TOO TRUE
BOTH OF THEM AND YOURS BOTH OF THEM TOO I WONDER IF IT COULD BE THE SAME SICKNESS I'M AFRAID IT IS WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR LAMP WICK
ROUND AND SHINY AS A BALL OF BUTTER WITH A FACE BEAMING LIKE AN APPLE A LITTLE MOUTH THAT ALWAYS SMILED AND A VOICE SMALL AND WHEEDLING LIKE THAT OF A CAT BEGGING FOR FOOD
BOYS GIVE PROMISES VERY EASILY BUT THEY AS EASILY FORGET THEM BUT I AM NOT LIKE THOSE OTHERS WHEN I GIVE MY WORD I KEEP IT
POOR BEAST COME COME SAID THE LITTLE MAN
AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF PLAY PINOCCHIO WAKES UP ONE FINE MORNING AND FINDS A GREAT SURPRISE AWAITING HIM FINALLY THE WAGON ARRIVED IT MADE NO NOISE
RUNS AWAY TO THE LAND OF TOYS WITH HIS FRIEND LAMP WICK
GOOD BY THEN AND REMEMBER ME TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS
YOU CAN MOUNT NOW MY BOY HE THEN SAID TO PINOCCHIO HAVE NO FEAR THAT DONKEY WAS WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING BUT I HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM AND NOW HE SEEMS QUIET
THE BOY'S REAL NAME WAS ROMEO BUT EVERYONE CALLED HIM LAMP WICK
AGAIN THE BOYS SHOUTED WITH LAUGHTER BUT THE LITTLE MAN INSTEAD OF LAUGHING BECAME SO LOVING TOWARD THE LITTLE ANIMAL THAT WITH ANOTHER KISS
OVER A DONKEY THAT CAN WEEP MOUNT QUICKLY AND LET US GO THE NIGHT IS COOL AND THE ROAD IS LONG PINOCCHIO OBEYED WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD THE WAGON STARTED AGAIN
A DORMOUSE CAME INTO THE ROOM A FAT LITTLE DORMOUSE WHO LIVED UPSTAIRS SEEING PINOCCHIO SO GRIEF STRICKEN SHE ASKED HIM ANXIOUSLY WHAT IS THE MATTER DEAR LITTLE NEIGHBOR
MUST SOONER OR LATER TURN INTO DONKEYS BUT IS IT REALLY SO
I CAN'T EITHER CRIED PINOCCHIO AND HIS LAUGHTER TURNED TO TEARS AS HE STUMBLED ABOUT HELPLESSLY THEY HAD HARDLY FINISHED SPEAKING WHEN BOTH OF THEM FELL ON ALL FOURS AND BEGAN RUNNING AND JUMPING AROUND THE ROOM
BUZZ OF A FAR AWAY MOSQUITO THERE IT IS CRIED LAMP WICK JUMPING TO HIS FEET WHAT
IN A LITTLE MORE THAN AN HOUR ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE INVITED SOME ACCEPTED QUICKLY AND GLADLY OTHERS HAD TO BE COAXED BUT WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THE TOAST
YOU OWE IT TO ME TO MY ADVICE TO MY CARE DO YOU ADMIT IT ONLY TRUE FRIENDS COUNT AFTER ALL IT'S TRUE LAMP WICK IT'S TRUE
BELIEVE ME IF YOU DON'T COME YOU'LL BE SORRY
I AM SORRY BUT I MUST GIVE YOU SOME VERY SAD NEWS WHAT IS IT YOU HAVE A VERY BAD FEVER
LARGE THOUGH IT WAS WAS COMPOSED WHOLLY OF BOYS THE OLDEST WERE ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE THE YOUNGEST EIGHT IN THE STREET THERE WAS SUCH A RACKET SUCH SHOUTING SUCH
IN THE MEANTIME THE NIGHT BECAME DARKER AND DARKER
CATCALLS HAND CLAPPING FOLLOWED THIS PARADE ONE BOY MADE A NOISE LIKE A HEN ANOTHER LIKE A ROOSTER AND A THIRD IMITATED A LION IN HIS DEN ALL TOGETHER THEY CREATED SUCH A PANDEMONIUM THAT IT
WEEPING WEEPING JUST LIKE A BOY HEY MISTER DRIVER
WHAT A PITY IF IT WERE ONLY ONE HOUR I MIGHT WAIT FOR YOU AND THE FAIRY
THINK HOW GREAT WAS HIS SURPRISE
LET US TAKE OFF OUR CAPS TOGETHER ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT READY THEN PINOCCHIO BEGAN TO COUNT ONE TWO THREE
TELL ME MY FINE BOY DO YOU ALSO WANT TO COME TO MY WONDERFUL COUNTRY
HAD ON THEIR FEET LACED SHOES MADE OF LEATHER JUST LIKE THE ONES BOYS WEAR AND THE DRIVER OF THE WAGON IMAGINE TO YOURSELVES A LITTLE FAT MAN
AND I GLADLY FORGIVE HIM
AND HIS FRIEND LAMP WICK WHEN THEY SAW EACH OTHER BOTH STRICKEN BY THE SAME MISFORTUNE INSTEAD OF FEELING SORROWFUL AND ASHAMED BEGAN TO POKE FUN AT EACH OTHER AND AFTER MUCH NONSENSE
THAT DAY HE WENT STRAIGHT TO HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE TO INVITE HIM TO THE PARTY BUT LAMP WICK WAS NOT AT HOME HE WENT A SECOND TIME AND AGAIN A THIRD
IT IS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU AND TO THINK THAT THE TEACHER WHEN SPEAKING OF YOU USED TO SAY DO NOT GO WITH THAT LAMP WICK
WORD JUST SEE THE SUN IS SETTING AND I MUST LEAVE YOU
DONKEY JUST LIKE THE ONES THAT PULL THE FRUIT CARTS TO MARKET OH WHAT HAVE I DONE
HE LEARNED TO MUMBLE A FEW WORDS WHEN HE LIVED FOR THREE YEARS WITH A
AT THAT MOMENT A LOUD KNOCKING WAS HEARD AT THE DOOR AND A VOICE CALLED TO THEM
INDEED I KNOW HOW MUCH HE DISLIKED ME AND HOW HE ENJOYED SPEAKING ILL OF ME BUT I AM OF
LIKE A MOUSE IN A PARMESAN CHEESE IS THAT REALLY TRUE WHY SHOULD I LIE TO YOU I BEG YOUR PARDON MY FRIEND BUT
AT THE SIGHT OF THAT BAG PINOCCHIO FELT SLIGHTLY HAPPIER AND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF MY FRIEND MUST BE SUFFERING FROM THE SAME SICKNESS THAT I AM
AND RECITED A FEW TURNED SOMERSAULTS OTHERS WALKED ON THEIR HANDS WITH THEIR FEET IN THE AIR GENERALS IN FULL UNIFORM LEADING REGIMENTS OF CARDBOARD SOLDIERS PASSED BY LAUGHTER SHRIEKS HOWLS
AT THE WORD THREE THE TWO BOYS PULLED OFF THEIR CAPS
IN THE LAND OF TOYS NOT EVEN THE SHADOW OF ONE NOT EVEN ONE TEACHER NOT ONE AND ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO STUDY
I WANTED TO RETURN HOME I WANTED TO BE OBEDIENT I WANTED TO STUDY AND TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL BUT LAMP WICK SAID TO ME
TO THINK THAT EVEN YESTERDAY THE IDEA CAME INTO YOUR HEAD TO RETURN HOME TO SEE YOUR FAIRY
I WANT TO SEE YOURS DEAR PINOCCHIO NO YOU MUST SHOW YOURS FIRST
I MUCH PREFER RIDING ONE OF THESE DONKEYS CRIED PINOCCHIO
BUT WHAT IS DONE CAN'T BE UNDONE INSTEAD OF MOANS AND CRIES THEY BURST FORTH INTO LOUD DONKEY BRAYS
THEY WERE STRINGING GROUND WIRES WE WERE AFRAID TO PUT UP POLES FOR THEY WOULD ATTRACT TOO MUCH INQUIRY GROUND WIRES WERE GOOD ENOUGH IN BOTH INSTANCES FOR MY WIRES WERE PROTECTED BY AN INSULATION OF MY OWN INVENTION WHICH WAS PERFECT
I DON'T DENY THAT I AM NOT BETTER THAN OTHERS WE COULDN'T SEEM TO MEET ANYBODY IN THIS LONESOME BRITAIN NOT EVEN AN OGRE AND IN THE MOOD I WAS IN THEN IT WAS WELL FOR THE OGRE THAT IS AN OGRE WITH A HANDKERCHIEF
MY WORKS SHOWED WHAT A DESPOT COULD DO WITH THE RESOURCES OF A KINGDOM AT HIS COMMAND UNSUSPECTED BY THIS DARK LAND
DRILLING THE KING ON THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH DAY WHEN IT WAS JUST SUNRISE AND WE HAD BEEN
AND RELIEVE ME OF IT THEN SHE EMPTIED THE CONVENIENCES OUT OF IT AND FETCHED IT FULL OF WATER AND I DRANK AND THEN STOOD UP AND SHE POURED THE REST DOWN INSIDE THE ARMOR ONE CANNOT THINK HOW REFRESHING IT WAS
IN FACT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THAT CAN RIGHT THE MATTER BUT PRACTICE THIS IS A GOOD PLACE FOR IT ROOTS AND STONY GROUND TO BREAK UP YOUR STATELY GAIT A REGION NOT LIABLE TO INTERRUPTION
MY MILITARY ACADEMY I KEPT THAT MOST JEALOUSLY OUT OF SIGHT AND I DID THE SAME WITH MY NAVAL ACADEMY WHICH I HAD ESTABLISHED AT A REMOTE SEAPORT BOTH WERE PROSPERING TO MY SATISFACTION
AND YOU HAD TO BE ALWAYS CHANGING HANDS AND PASSING YOUR SPEAR OVER TO THE OTHER FOOT IT GOT SO IRKSOME FOR ONE HAND TO HOLD IT LONG AT A TIME WELL
WE COULD IMAGINE NO EXPLANATION THAT WOULD BEGIN TO EXPLAIN HAD THERE BEEN AN INVASION
WAITING IN SILENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN AGREEABLE ENOUGH FOR I WAS FULL OF MATTER FOR REFLECTION AND WANTED TO GIVE IT A CHANCE TO WORK I WANTED TO TRY AND THINK OUT HOW IT WAS THAT RATIONAL OR EVEN HALF RATIONAL MEN
A FLY GOT IN THROUGH THE BARS AND SETTLED ON MY NOSE AND THE BARS WERE STUCK AND WOULDN'T WORK AND I COULDN'T GET THE VISOR UP AND I COULD ONLY SHAKE MY HEAD WHICH WAS
RICH GLOOM OF THE FOREST WHERE
JUST AS NEAR NOTHING AS YOU CAN CIPHER IT DOWN AND I WILL BE SATISFIED TOO INTELLECTUAL WORK IS MISNAMED IT IS A PLEASURE A DISSIPATION AND
BUT NOW EVERYTHING WAS IN GOOD HANDS AND SWIMMING RIGHT ALONG THE KING HAD REMINDED ME SEVERAL TIMES OF LATE THAT THE POSTPONEMENT I HAD ASKED FOR FOUR YEARS BEFORE HAD ABOUT RUN OUT NOW
I BECAME HER WORSHIPER AND OURS WAS THE DEAREST AND PERFECTEST COMRADESHIP THAT EVER WAS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIPS BETWEEN TWO PERSONS OF THE SAME SEX WHAT IS THE BEST OF THAT SORT
AND LEAVE HIS DESPOTISM IN THE HANDS OF AN IMPERFECT SUCCESSOR AN EARTHLY DESPOTISM IS NOT MERELY A BAD FORM OF GOVERNMENT IT IS THE WORST FORM THAT IS POSSIBLE
THEIR FACES SHOWED IT I CALLED AN ESCORT AND WE GALLOPED FIVE MILES TO A HILLTOP OVERLOOKING THE SEA WHERE WAS MY GREAT COMMERCE THAT
REALIZE NOTHING VIVIFY NOTHING TO YOU UNLESS YOU HAVE SUFFERED IN YOUR OWN PERSON THE THING WHICH THE WORDS TRY TO DESCRIBE THERE ARE WISE PEOPLE WHO TALK EVER SO KNOWINGLY AND COMPLACENTLY ABOUT
REVENUES WERE ALREADY QUADRUPLED AND YET THE BURDEN WAS SO MUCH MORE EQUABLY DISTRIBUTED THAN BEFORE THAT ALL THE KINGDOM FELT A SENSE OF RELIEF AND THE PRAISES OF MY ADMINISTRATION WERE HEARTY AND GENERAL
MIST OF GREEN LIGHT THAT GOT ITS TINT FROM THE SUN DRENCHED ROOF OF LEAVES OVERHEAD
OPPRESSION INSULT AND THE OTHER SEVERAL AND COMMON INHUMANITIES THAT SAP THE MANLINESS OUT OF A MAN AND MAKE HIM A LOYAL AND PROPER AND APPROVED SUBJECT AND A SATISFACTION TO HIS MASTERS
AND SEEN IT COME BACK TO LIFE AND SWEEP NIGHT OUT OF THE EARTH WITH ONE ALL ILLUMINATING SMILE THAT YOU COULD COVER WITH YOUR HAND WHY
PLEASE WALK THIRTY YARDS SO THAT I CAN GET A PERSPECTIVE ON THE THING NOW THEN YOUR HEAD'S RIGHT SPEED'S RIGHT SHOULDERS RIGHT EYES RIGHT CHIN RIGHT
IMAGINING THE HANDKERCHIEF PICTURING THE HANDKERCHIEF AND IT WAS BITTER AND AGGRAVATING TO HAVE THE SALT SWEAT KEEP TRICKLING DOWN INTO MY EYES AND I COULDN'T GET AT IT IT SEEMS LIKE A LITTLE THING ON PAPER
HERE MADE HOLY AND THE MUSIC OF IT WILL ABIDE ALWAY IN OUR EARS NOW THOU'LT KISS ME AS KNOWING THE NAME I HAVE GIVEN THE CHILD BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT ALL THE SAME I HADN'T AN IDEA IN THE WORLD
WE CROSSED BROAD NATURAL LAWNS SPARKLING WITH DEW AND WE MOVED LIKE SPIRITS THE CUSHIONED TURF GIVING OUT NO SOUND OF FOOTFALL WE DREAMED ALONG THROUGH GLADES IN A
AND EATEN UP BY RELENTLESS CREDITORS YOU ARE OUT OF WORK WHICH IS HORSE SHOEING LET US SAY AND CAN GET NONE
BEFORE YOU COULD EVEN GET YOUR EYE ON THE PLACE WHERE THE NOISE WAS AND WHERE ONLY THE EARLIEST BIRDS WERE TURNING OUT AND GETTING TO BUSINESS WITH A SONG HERE AND A QUARREL YONDER AND A MYSTERIOUS
THE VAST CASTLE LOOMED BLACK UPON THE HILLTOP NOT A SPARK VISIBLE ABOUT IT THE DRAWBRIDGE WAS DOWN THE GREAT GATE STOOD WIDE I ENTERED WITHOUT CHALLENGE MY OWN HEELS MAKING THE ONLY SOUND I HEARD
VARLETS NAY IS THAT TRUE YES ONLY THOSE ABOVE THEM CALL THEM SO THEN MUST I TRY AGAIN
GAIT CARRIAGE GENERAL STYLE RIGHT EVERYTHING'S RIGHT AND YET THE FACT REMAINS THE AGGREGATE'S WRONG
YOU SEE THE SUN WAS BEATING DOWN AND WARMING UP THE IRON MORE AND MORE ALL THE TIME WELL WHEN YOU ARE HOT THAT WAY EVERY LITTLE THING IRRITATES YOU WHEN I TROTTED I RATTLED LIKE A CRATE OF DISHES AND THAT ANNOYED ME
IN PERPETUAL HONOR AND REMEMBRANCE OF MY LOST FRIEND AND HER SMALL NAMESAKE THIS WAS NOT TRUE BUT IT ANSWERED WELL
AND HANG OUT THE SIGNS OF THEM IN SLOUCHING BODY AND UNSURE STEP IT IS THE SORDID CARES OF THE LOWLY BORN THAT DO THESE THINGS YOU MUST LEARN THE TRICK YOU MUST IMITATE THE TRADEMARKS OF POVERTY MISERY
SPIRITUAL WANTS AND INSTINCTS ARE AS VARIOUS IN THE HUMAN FAMILY AS ARE PHYSICAL APPETITES
DIDN'T MIND AT ALL AT FIRST I BEGAN TO MIND NOW AND MORE AND MORE TOO ALL THE TIME THE FIRST TEN OR FIFTEEN TIMES I WANTED MY HANDKERCHIEF I DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE I GOT ALONG AND
BUT THEY WERE NECESSARILY SLIGHT AND THEY WERE NOT NOTICEABLE THUS FAR I HAD NOT EVEN MEDDLED WITH TAXATION OUTSIDE OF THE TAXES WHICH PROVIDED THE ROYAL REVENUES I HAD SYSTEMATIZED THOSE AND PUT THE SERVICE ON AN EFFECTIVE AND RIGHTEOUS BASIS
IT WAS FENCED AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC VIEW BUT THERE IT WAS A GIGANTIC AND UNASSAILABLE FACT AND TO BE HEARD FROM YET IF I LIVED AND HAD LUCK THERE IT WAS
AND THERE HUNG THE BELL SHROUDED IN BLACK
AH YOUR GRACE THAT IS NOT WELL DONE IN WHAT LACKETH IT THESE PEOPLE DO NOT CALL EACH OTHER
TO DIRT LIKE THAT
YOU COULDN'T THINK WHERE SANDY WAS SHE WAS A QUITE BIDDABLE CREATURE AND GOOD HEARTED BUT SHE HAD A FLOW OF TALK THAT WAS AS STEADY AS A MILL AND MADE YOUR HEAD SORE LIKE THE DRAYS AND WAGONS IN A CITY
ANY MORE THAN A FOG HAS SHE WAS A PERFECT BLATHERSKITE I MEAN FOR JAW JAW JAW TALK TALK TALK JABBER JABBER JABBER BUT JUST AS GOOD AS SHE COULD BE
AND HAD STRAIGHTWAY RESUMED HER OLD PLACE AT MY SIDE IN THE PLACIDEST WAY AND AS OF RIGHT I WAS A NEW ENGLANDER AND IN MY OPINION THIS SORT OF PARTNERSHIP WOULD COMPROMISE HER
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CRUEL TO CONFESS IT AND SPOIL HER PRETTY GAME SO I NEVER LET ON BUT SAID YES I KNOW SWEETHEART
EVERY ONE HAS NOTICED THAT WELL IT TOOK MY MIND OFF FROM EVERYTHING ELSE TOOK IT CLEAR OFF AND CENTERED IT IN MY HELMET AND MILE AFTER MILE THERE IT STAYED
THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AND IT MADE FOOLS OF US FOR JOY THE DARLING MISPRONUNCIATIONS OF CHILDHOOD DEAR ME THERE'S NO MUSIC THAT CAN TOUCH IT
THE VERY CATS WOULD KNOW THIS MASQUERADER FOR A HUMBUG AND NO PEASANT SO I CALLED A HALT AND SAID SIRE AS BETWEEN CLOTHES AND COUNTENANCE YOU ARE ALL RIGHT THERE IS NO DISCREPANCY
FAIR GREEN VALLEYS LYING SPREAD OUT BELOW WITH STREAMS WINDING THROUGH THEM AND ISLAND GROVES OF TREES HERE AND THERE AND HUGE LONELY OAKS SCATTERED ABOUT AND CASTING BLACK BLOTS OF SHADE
BUT YOU CAN'T CORK THAT KIND THEY WOULD DIE HER CLACK WAS GOING ALL DAY AND YOU WOULD THINK SOMETHING WOULD SURELY HAPPEN TO HER WORKS BY AND BY BUT NO THEY NEVER GOT OUT OF ORDER AND SHE NEVER HAD TO SLACK UP FOR WORDS
VARIOUS RELIEF EXPEDITIONS AND
NOT THE WHOLE IDEA AT ONCE WOULD YOU HAVE A SEAT ALSO AND SIT IF I DID NOT SIT THE MAN WOULD PERCEIVE THAT WE WERE ONLY PRETENDING TO BE EQUALS AND PLAYING THE DECEPTION PRETTY POORLY TOO
CLARENCE WAS TWENTY TWO NOW AND WAS MY HEAD EXECUTIVE MY RIGHT HAND HE WAS A DARLING HE WAS EQUAL TO ANYTHING THERE WASN'T ANYTHING HE COULDN'T TURN HIS HAND TO
AS SURE A FACT AND AS SUBSTANTIAL A FACT AS ANY SERENE VOLCANO STANDING INNOCENT WITH ITS SMOKELESS SUMMIT IN THE BLUE SKY AND GIVING NO SIGN OF THE RISING HELL IN ITS BOWELS
BUT NOTHING IS QUITE PERFECT IN THIS LIFE AT ANY TIME I HAD MADE A PIPE A WHILE BACK AND ALSO SOME PRETTY FAIR TOBACCO NOT THE REAL THING BUT WHAT SOME OF THE INDIANS USE THE INSIDE BARK OF THE WILLOW
EXCEPT THAT BY THE CUSTOMS OF CHIVALRY SHE WAS MY PROPERTY UNTIL SOME KNIGHT SHOULD WIN HER FROM ME IN THE FIELD SHE HAD HUNTED BRITAIN OVER FOR ME HAD FOUND ME AT THE HANGING BOUT OUTSIDE OF LONDON
FROM BEING THE BEST ELECTRIC LIGHTED TOWN IN THE KINGDOM AND THE MOST LIKE A RECUMBENT SUN OF ANYTHING YOU EVER SAW IT WAS BECOME SIMPLY A BLOT A BLOT UPON DARKNESS
THE ONE IS EARTHLY THE OTHER DIVINE IN MY DREAMS ALONG AT FIRST I STILL WANDERED THIRTEEN CENTURIES AWAY
NOW TIS RIGHT NOT QUITE
REALLY THINK THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT THE ONE
OF LATE I HAD BEEN TRAINING HIM FOR JOURNALISM
IT WAS ALREADY UP TO THE BACK SETTLEMENT ALABAMA MARK AND COULDN'T BE TOLD FROM THE EDITORIAL OUTPUT OF THAT REGION EITHER BY MATTER OR FLAVOR WE HAD ANOTHER LARGE DEPARTURE ON HAND TOO
THEN I SHOULD BE READY ALL THE CHANCES WERE THAT AT THE END OF THAT TIME
SHE CONTINUED TO FETCH AND POUR UNTIL I WAS WELL SOAKED AND THOROUGHLY COMFORTABLE IT WAS GOOD TO HAVE A REST AND PEACE
BUT I TOLD HER I HAD GIVEN ORDER FOR IT THAT HENCEFORTH AND FOREVER THE TELEPHONE MUST ALWAYS BE INVOKED WITH THAT REVERENT FORMALITY
PLEASE YOU BETRAY TOO MUCH VIGOR TOO MUCH DECISION YOU WANT MORE OF A SHAMBLE LOOK AT ME PLEASE THIS IS WHAT I MEAN NOW YOU ARE GETTING IT
SO THERE YOU ARE NOTHING BUT IRON BETWEEN IT IS NOT A LIGHT THING LET IT SOUND AS IT MAY FIRST IT IS ONE PLACE THEN ANOTHER THEN SOME MORE
WHEN WE WERE SAFE BEYOND THE TOWN I PUT THEM ON AND FROM THAT TIME I TRAVELED ALONE I COULD NOT RISK THE EMBARRASSMENT OF COMPANY A MISERABLE JOURNEY A DESOLATE SILENCE EVERYWHERE
INVASION INVASION IS A TRIVIALITY TO IT
FAR OFF HAMMERING AND DRUMMING FOR WORMS ON A TREE TRUNK AWAY SOMEWHERE IN THE IMPENETRABLE REMOTENESSES OF THE WOODS AND BY AND BY OUT WE WOULD SWING AGAIN INTO THE GLARE ABOUT THE THIRD OR
HE TOOK TO IT LIKE A DUCK THERE WAS AN EDITOR CONCEALED IN HIM SURE ALREADY HE HAD DOUBLED HIMSELF IN ONE WAY HE TALKED SIXTH CENTURY AND WROTE NINETEENTH HIS JOURNALISTIC STYLE WAS CLIMBING STEADILY
OR THE VERY INFANTS WILL KNOW YOU FOR BETTER THAN YOUR DISGUISE AND WE SHALL GO TO PIECES AT THE FIRST HUT WE STOP AT PRAY TRY TO WALK LIKE THIS THE KING TOOK CAREFUL NOTE
WITH THE WIDE HIGHWAY OF SALT WATER ALL TO MYSELF THERE WERE SHIPS IN THE HARBOR AT DOVER BUT THEY WERE NAKED AS TO SAILS AND THERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE ABOUT THEM IT WAS SUNDAY YET AT CANTERBURY THE STREETS WERE EMPTY STRANGEST OF ALL
A SHIP NO BIGGER THAN A STEAM LAUNCH AND WAS SOON READY THE PARTING AH YES THAT WAS HARD AS I WAS DEVOURING THE CHILD WITH LAST KISSES IT BRISKED UP AND JABBERED OUT ITS VOCABULARY
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU PERSPIRE THAT WAY IN RIVERS THERE COMES A TIME WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WELL WHEN YOU ITCH YOU ARE INSIDE YOUR HANDS ARE OUTSIDE
SANDY WHAT A RIGHT HEART SHE HAD HOW SIMPLE AND GENUINE AND GOOD SHE WAS SHE WAS A FLAWLESS WIFE AND MOTHER AND YET I HAD MARRIED HER FOR NO OTHER PARTICULAR REASONS
NO VALUABLE TIME WOULD BE LOST BY THE POSTPONEMENT I SHOULD THEN HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AND I BELIEVED MY SYSTEM AND MACHINERY WOULD BE SO WELL DEVELOPED THAT I COULD TAKE A HOLIDAY WITHOUT ITS WORKING ANY HARM
PERSONALLY I STRUCK AN INTERRUPTION NOW BUT I DID NOT MIND IT IT COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED AT A BETTER TIME
BUT IT WAS NOT A LITTLE THING AT ALL IT WAS THE MOST REAL KIND OF MISERY I WOULD NOT SAY IT IF IT WAS NOT SO I MADE UP MY MIND THAT I WOULD CARRY ALONG A RETICULE NEXT TIME LET IT LOOK HOW IT MIGHT
BUT SO I GOT HIS BANDANNA HE COULD KEEP HIS HARDWARE FOR ALL OF ME MEANTIME
THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE TURNED THE CORNER AND BEGAN TO MEND GRATEFUL IT ISN'T THE TERM THERE ISN'T ANY TERM FOR IT YOU KNOW THAT YOURSELF IF YOU'VE WATCHED YOUR CHILD THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW
SO I GAVE IN
PERMITTING NOTHING OF IT IN MY OTHER EDUCATIONAL BUILDINGS I COULD HAVE GIVEN MY OWN SECT THE PREFERENCE AND MADE EVERYBODY A PRESBYTERIAN WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO AFFRONT A LAW OF HUMAN NATURE
IT WAS NOT MY POLICY THE PEOPLE COULD NOT HAVE STOOD IT AND MOREOVER I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE ESTABLISHED ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH ON MY BACK IN A MINUTE NO
THAT HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME WHEN I PUT IT THERE AND IN FACT I DIDN'T KNOW IT I SUPPOSED IT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY CONVENIENT THERE AND SO NOW THE THOUGHT OF ITS BEING THERE SO HANDY AND CLOSE BY AND YET
THAT IS TO SAY IT WAS DARKER AND SOLIDER THAN THE REST OF THE DARKNESS AND SO YOU COULD SEE IT A LITTLE BETTER IT MADE ME FEEL AS IF MAYBE IT WAS SYMBOLICAL A SORT OF SIGN THAT THE CHURCH WAS GOING TO KEEP THE UPPER HAND NOW
NOBODY COULD TELL YOU HOW TO FIND ANY PLACE IN THE KINGDOM FOR NOBODY EVER WENT INTENTIONALLY TO ANY PLACE BUT ONLY STRUCK IT BY ACCIDENT IN HIS WANDERINGS AND THEN GENERALLY LEFT IT WITHOUT THINKING TO INQUIRE WHAT ITS NAME WAS
YES I HAD MADE PRETTY HANDSOME PROGRESS WHEN SIR SAGRAMOR'S CHALLENGE STRUCK ME FOUR YEARS ROLLED BY AND THEN WELL
OUR FIRST VENTURE IN THIS LINE THESE WIRES WERE FOR PRIVATE SERVICE ONLY AS YET AND MUST BE KEPT PRIVATE UNTIL A RIPER DAY SHOULD COME WE HAD A GANG OF MEN ON THE ROAD WORKING MAINLY BY NIGHT
BROTHER BRING A SEAT AND
NO PRIEST A FUNERAL WITHOUT BELL BOOK OR CANDLE THERE WAS A CHURCH THERE CLOSE AT HAND BUT THEY PASSED IT BY WEEPING AND DID NOT ENTER IT I GLANCED UP AT THE BELFRY
AND NO NAPKIN WHETHER HE BE SERF OR FREE PLEASE WALK AGAIN MY LIEGE THERE IT IS BETTER IT IS THE BEST YET BUT NOT PERFECT THE SHOULDERS HAVE KNOWN
AND HOW ONE GRIEVES WHEN IT WASTES AWAY AND DISSOLVES INTO CORRECTNESS KNOWING IT WILL NEVER VISIT HIS BEREAVED EAR AGAIN WELL
JUST A DEAD AND EMPTY SOLITUDE IN PLACE OF ALL THAT BRISK AND BREEZY LIFE I WENT SWIFTLY BACK SAYING NOT A WORD TO ANYBODY I TOLD SANDY THIS GHASTLY NEWS
NO NO FOR HE MAY BE A FREEMAN AH SO THEN PERADVENTURE I SHOULD CALL HIM GOODMAN THAT WOULD ANSWER YOUR GRACE
AND PEOPLE SAY WHAT THEY WOULD OF COURSE THESE IRON DUDES OF THE ROUND TABLE WOULD THINK IT WAS SCANDALOUS AND MAYBE RAISE SHEOL ABOUT IT BUT AS FOR ME GIVE ME COMFORT FIRST AND STYLE AFTERWARDS
CLEAREST AND COLDEST OF RUNLETS WENT FRISKING AND GOSSIPING OVER ITS REEFS AND MAKING A SORT OF WHISPERING MUSIC COMFORTABLE TO HEAR AND AT TIMES WE LEFT THE WORLD BEHIND AND ENTERED INTO THE SOLEMN GREAT DEEPS AND
AND IT GOES ON SPREADING AND SPREADING AND AT LAST THE TERRITORY IS ALL OCCUPIED AND NOBODY CAN IMAGINE WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE NOR HOW UNPLEASANT IT IS AND WHEN IT HAD GOT TO THE WORST AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I COULD NOT STAND ANYTHING MORE
UNCONSCIOUSLY STRAIGHTENED UP LIKE A MONUMENT AND SAID WITH FROZEN AUSTERITY VARLET BRING A SEAT AND SERVE TO ME WHAT CHEER YE HAVE
THE IRON AND STEEL MISSIONARIES OF MY FUTURE CIVILIZATION IN THESE WERE GATHERED TOGETHER THE BRIGHTEST YOUNG MINDS I COULD FIND AND I KEPT AGENTS OUT RAKING THE COUNTRY FOR MORE ALL THE TIME I WAS TRAINING A CROWD OF
CONSTRUCTIVELY IN HEAVEN WHEN HE IS AT WORK AND AS FOR THE MUSICIAN WITH THE FIDDLE BOW IN HIS HAND WHO SITS IN THE MIDST OF A GREAT ORCHESTRA WITH THE EBBING AND FLOWING TIDES OF DIVINE SOUND WASHING OVER HIM WHY
AND MOREOVER I COULDN'T SEEM TO STAND THAT SHIELD SLATTING AND BANGING NOW ABOUT MY BREAST
EXCEPT THE MAN BE OF THE SERF CLASS AND FINALLY
AND PARALYSIS TO HUMAN THOUGHT ALL MINES WERE ROYAL PROPERTY AND THERE WERE A GOOD MANY OF THEM THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN WORKED AS SAVAGES ALWAYS WORK MINES
FOURTH OR FIFTH TIME THAT WE SWUNG OUT INTO THE GLARE IT WAS ALONG THERE SOMEWHERE A COUPLE OF HOURS OR SO AFTER SUN UP IT WASN'T AS PLEASANT AS IT HAD BEEN IT WAS BEGINNING TO GET HOT THIS WAS QUITE NOTICEABLE
HOW DEAR AND GOOD IT IS OF YOU TOO BUT I WANT TO HEAR THESE LIPS OF YOURS WHICH ARE ALSO MINE UTTER IT FIRST THEN ITS MUSIC WILL BE PERFECT PLEASED TO THE MARROW SHE MURMURED HELLO CENTRAL I DIDN'T LAUGH
HOLES GRUBBED IN THE EARTH AND THE MINERAL BROUGHT UP IN SACKS OF HIDE BY HAND AT THE RATE OF A TON A DAY BUT I HAD BEGUN TO PUT THE MINING ON A SCIENTIFIC BASIS AS EARLY AS I COULD
AND SNUFF OUT ALL MY BEAUTIFUL CIVILIZATION JUST LIKE THAT I FOUND NO LIFE STIRRING IN THE SOMBER STREETS I GROPED MY WAY WITH A HEAVY HEART
CONSIDERING ITS INCONVENIENCES AND HOW THEY HAD MANAGED TO KEEP UP SUCH A FASHION FOR GENERATIONS WHEN IT WAS PLAIN THAT WHAT I HAD SUFFERED TO DAY THEY HAD HAD TO SUFFER ALL THE DAYS OF THEIR LIVES
IF I DROPPED INTO A WALK MY JOINTS CREAKED AND SCREECHED IN THAT WEARISOME WAY THAT A WHEELBARROW DOES AND AS WE DIDN'T CREATE ANY BREEZE AT THAT GAIT I WAS LIKE TO GET FRIED IN THAT STOVE AND BESIDES THE QUIETER YOU WENT
PLEASE NOW I THINK I BEGIN TO SEE WHAT IT IS YES I'VE STRUCK IT YOU SEE THE GENUINE SPIRITLESSNESS IS WANTING THAT'S WHAT'S THE TROUBLE IT'S ALL AMATEUR
IT WAS THE INTERDICT I ASKED NO QUESTIONS I DIDN'T NEED TO ASK ANY THE CHURCH HAD STRUCK THE THING FOR ME TO DO WAS TO GET INTO A DISGUISE AND GO WARILY ONE OF MY SERVANTS GAVE ME A SUIT OF CLOTHES AND
CERTAINLY HE IS AT WORK IF YOU WISH TO CALL IT THAT BUT LORD IT'S A SARCASM JUST THE SAME THE LAW OF WORK DOES SEEM UTTERLY UNFAIR BUT THERE IT IS AND NOTHING CAN CHANGE IT
AND FOR WEEKS AFTERWARD I COULD HEAR MY BONES CLACK WHEN I WALKED SHE NEVER FOUND OUT HER MISTAKE THE FIRST TIME SHE HEARD THAT FORM OF SALUTE USED AT THE TELEPHONE SHE WAS SURPRISED AND NOT PLEASED
AT ONE TIME AND ANOTHER WE HAD SENT OUT TOPOGRAPHICAL EXPEDITIONS TO SURVEY AND MAP THE KINGDOM BUT THE PRIESTS HAD ALWAYS INTERFERED AND RAISED TROUBLE SO WE HAD GIVEN THE THING UP FOR THE PRESENT
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT AT LAST IN THE FURTHER EDGE OF THAT TOWN I SAW A SMALL FUNERAL PROCESSION JUST A FAMILY AND A FEW FRIENDS FOLLOWING A COFFIN
THERE VERY GOOD EYES TOO HIGH PRAY DON'T LOOK AT THE HORIZON LOOK AT THE GROUND TEN STEPS IN FRONT OF YOU AH THAT IS BETTER THAT IS VERY GOOD WAIT
THE HEAVIER THE IRON SETTLED DOWN ON YOU
TRAMPING AN HOUR IN THE CHILL DAWN I CAME TO A RESOLUTION THE KING MUST BE DRILLED THINGS COULD NOT GO ON SO HE MUST BE TAKEN IN HAND AND DELIBERATELY AND CONSCIENTIOUSLY DRILLED
FOR NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO COME INTO THEIR PRECINCTS WITHOUT A SPECIAL PERMIT FOR I WAS AFRAID OF THE CHURCH I HAD STARTED A TEACHER FACTORY
WHILE THE RELIEVED BRANCHES SPRING UP AND WAVE WITH STARTLING EFFECT IN THE GENERAL STILLNESS AS IF EACH TREE WAS MOVING OF ITS OWN VOLITION HUNDREDS OF BROAD CLOUD SHAPED MASSES MAY ALSO BE SEEN
THE GREAT CENTURY AVALANCHES AND THE KIND THAT MOW WIDE SWATHS THROUGH THE UPPER FORESTS OCCUR ON MOUNTAIN SIDES ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE THOUSAND FEET HIGH
THE GROWTH OF FIVE GENERATIONS DIFFUSED THROUGH ALL RANKS AND PARTIES AND INTERTWINED NOT LESS CLOSELY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE TORY THAN WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WHIG
AFTER ALL THE AVALANCHES ARE DOWN AND THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST THEN ALL THE YOSEMITE STREAMS FROM THEIR FOUNTAINS TO THEIR FALLS SING THEIR GRANDEST SONGS COUNTLESS RILLS MAKE HASTE TO THE RIVERS
OF OBTAINING AT ONCE GREATNESS AND REVENGE BUT NEITHER FANATICISM NOR AMBITION NEITHER RESENTMENT FOR PAST WRONGS NOR THE INTOXICATION PRODUCED BY SUDDEN GOOD FORTUNE
THE GOVERNMENT WAS BENT ON DESTROYING A VICTIM OF NO HIGH RANK A SURGEON IN THE CITY NAMED BATEMAN HE HAD ATTENDED SHAFTESBURY PROFESSIONALLY AND HAD BEEN A ZEALOUS EXCLUSIONIST
HE HAD SEEN THE PATH OF DUTY PLAIN BEFORE HIM THROUGH GOOD AND EVIL HE WAS TO BE TRUE TO CHURCH AND KING BUT IF THOSE TWO AUGUST AND VENERABLE POWERS
BEEN ONE CHARLES THE FIRST WAS REGARDED BY THE CHURCH AS HER MARTYR IF CHARLES THE SECOND HAD PLOTTED AGAINST HER HE HAD PLOTTED IN SECRET IN PUBLIC HE HAD EVER PROFESSED HIMSELF
IN THIS WAY THE VOLUME OF THE UPPER BRANCHES OF THE RIVER IS NEARLY DOUBLED DURING THE DAY RISING AND FALLING AS REGULARLY AS THE TIDES OF THE SEA
AND HIS ZEAL FOR THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION HAD GROWN UP TOGETHER AND HAD STRENGTHENED EACH OTHER IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE TWO SENTIMENTS WHICH SEEMED INSEPARABLE AND EVEN IDENTICAL
COMPELLING HUGE SLEEPING BOULDERS TO WAKE UP AND JOIN IN THEIR DANCE AND SONG TO SWELL THEIR EXULTING CHORUS IN EARLY SUMMER AFTER THE FLOOD SEASON THE YOSEMITE STREAMS ARE IN THEIR PRIME
THEN AWAY IN GRAND STYLE GO THE PONDEROUS ICY MASSES WITHOUT ANY FINE SNOW DUST THOSE OF CLOUDS REST DESCEND LIKE THUNDERBOLTS FOR MORE THAN A MILE
AND CONTAINED NOTHING WHICH HAD NOT IN THE OPINION OF ALL PROTESTANT DIVINES BEEN TEN THOUSAND TIMES REFUTED IN HIS IGNORANT EXULTATION
A DULL RUSHING RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD WHICH RAPIDLY INCREASES AND SEEMS TO DRAW NEARER WITH APPALLING INTENSITY OF TONE PRESENTLY THE WHITE FLOOD COMES BOUNDING INTO SIGHT OVER BOSSES AND SHEER PLACES
COULD PREVENT THE MOST EMINENT ROMAN CATHOLICS FROM PERCEIVING THAT THE PROSPERITY WHICH THEY AT LENGTH ENJOYED WAS ONLY TEMPORARY AND UNLESS WISELY USED MIGHT BE FATAL TO THEM
TO OBTAIN FROM THE PARLIAMENT A REPEAL OF THE ACTS WHICH IMPOSED CIVIL DISABILITIES ON THOSE WHO PROFESSED HIS RELIGION BUT IF HE ATTEMPTED TO SUBDUE THE PROTESTANT FEELING OF ENGLAND BY RUDE MEANS
AT LENGTH ALL THEIR PLANS PERFECTED TUFTED FLAKES AND SINGLE STARRY CRYSTALS COME IN SIGHT SOLEMNLY SWIRLING AND GLINTING TO THEIR BLESSED APPOINTED PLACES
THE OPPRESSED PURITANS RECKONED UP NOT WITHOUT A GLOOMY SATISFACTION THE HOUSES WHICH HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN AND THE SHIPS WHICH HAD BEEN CAST AWAY AND DERIVED SOME CONSOLATION FROM THINKING THAT HEAVEN WAS BEARING AWFUL TESTIMONY
LEAPING OVER THE BROWS OF THE CLIFFS FROM GREAT HEIGHTS DESCENDING AT FIRST WITH REGULAR AVALANCHE SPEED UNTIL WORN INTO DUST BY FRICTION THEY FLOAT IN FRONT OF THE PRECIPICES LIKE IRISED CLOUDS
SMOKE ET CETERA STILL ATTEND STEAM TRAVEL THIS FLIGHT IN WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A MILKY WAY OF SNOW STARS WAS THE MOST SPIRITUAL AND EXHILARATING OF ALL THE MODES OF MOTION I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED
LET ME HAVE A SOLID ANSWER AND IN A GENTLEMANLIKE STYLE AND IT MAY HAVE THE EFFECT WHICH YOU SO MUCH DESIRE OF BRINGING ME OVER TO YOUR CHURCH
WAS THE MOST UNPARDONABLE BURTON KNEW THIS HE DELIVERED HIMSELF UP TO THE GOVERNMENT AND HE GAVE INFORMATION AGAINST FERNLEY AND ELIZABETH GAUNT THEY WERE BROUGHT TO TRIAL THE VILLAIN WHOSE LIFE THEY HAD PRESERVED
OF WHICH THEY HAD READ IN FOX WILLIAM PENN FOR WHOM EXHIBITIONS WHICH HUMANE MEN GENERALLY AVOID SEEM TO HAVE HAD A STRONG ATTRACTION HASTENED FROM CHEAPSIDE
I FOUND MYSELF ON TOP OF THE CRUMPLED PILE WITHOUT BRUISE OR SCAR THIS WAS A FINE EXPERIENCE HAWTHORNE SAYS SOMEWHERE THAT STEAM HAS SPIRITUALIZED TRAVEL THOUGH UNSPIRITUAL SMELLS
AND TOOK REFUGE IN THE HOUSE OF JOHN FERNLEY A BARBER IN WHITECHAPEL FERNLEY WAS VERY POOR HE WAS BESIEGED BY CREDITORS
IT WAS INDEED IN THE POWER OF THE KING BY THE EXERCISE OF HIS PREROGATIVE OF MERCY TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF THE PENAL LAWS IT MIGHT HEREAFTER BE IN HIS POWER BY DISCREET MANAGEMENT
AND IN THE MAIN CANYONS FLOWING IN REGULAR CHANNELS AND BOOMING LIKE WATERFALLS WHILE COUNTLESS SMALLER ONES FALL EVERYWHERE FROM LADEN TREES AND ROCKS AND LOFTY CANYON WALLS
THOSE WHICH DESCEND FROM THE BROW OF EL CAPITAN ARE PARTICULARLY FINE BUT MOST OF THE GREAT YOSEMITE AVALANCHES FLOW IN REGULAR CHANNELS LIKE CASCADES AND WATERFALLS WHEN THE SNOW FIRST GIVES WAY ON THE UPPER SLOPES OF THEIR BASINS
ELIJAH'S FLIGHT IN A CHARIOT OF FIRE COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN MORE GLORIOUSLY EXCITING THE STREAMS IN OTHER SEASONS IN THE SPRING
AVALANCHES ARE SHORT LIVED FEW OF THEM LASTING MORE THAN A MINUTE OR TWO AND THE SHARP CLASHING SOUNDS SO COMMON IN FALLING WATER ARE MOSTLY WANTING
STOOD BY HIM AT THE BAR THEY READ AS WELL AS THEY COULD SOME NOTES WHICH HE HAD SET DOWN AND EXAMINED HIS WITNESSES IT WAS TO LITTLE PURPOSE
AND ALL THE LANDSCAPE IS GLOWING LIKE A BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE THEN THE STREAMS ARE AT THEIR LOWEST EBB WITH SCARCE A MEMORY LEFT OF THEIR WILD SPRING FLOODS
ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT IN SOME PLACES AFTER SPENDING THE WHOLE DAY TO WITHIN HALF AN HOUR OR SO OF SUNDOWN I WAS STILL SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE SUMMIT THEN MY HOPES WERE REDUCED
AND IT WAS REMARKED BY THOSE WHO WATCHED THEIR DEPORTMENT THAT THEY HAD COME BACK FROM THE CARNAGE OF TAUNTON IN A FIERCE AND EXCITED STATE IT IS INDEED BUT TOO TRUE THAT THE TASTE FOR BLOOD
VARYING GREATLY IN FORM SIZE BEHAVIOR AND IN THE SONGS THEY SING SOME ON THE SMOOTH SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE SHORT AND BROAD OTHERS LONG AND RIVER LIKE IN THE SIDE CANYONS OF YOSEMITES
THOUGH AT SUCH TIMES ONE THINKS FAST ONE FINE YOSEMITE MORNING AFTER A HEAVY SNOWFALL BEING EAGER TO SEE AS MANY AVALANCHES AS POSSIBLE AND WIDE VIEWS OF THE FOREST AND SUMMIT PEAKS IN THEIR NEW WHITE ROBES
CHAPTER THREE SNOW STORMS AS HAS BEEN ALREADY STATED THE FIRST OF THE GREAT SNOW STORMS THAT REPLENISH THE YOSEMITE FOUNTAINS
JAMES HIMSELF DISTRIBUTED THE WHOLE EDITION AMONG HIS COURTIERS AND AMONG THE PEOPLE OF HUMBLER RANK WHO CROWDED ROUND HIS COACH HE GAVE ONE COPY TO A YOUNG WOMAN OF MEAN CONDITION
HAD BEGUN TO FEEL PAINFUL MISGIVINGS AND OCCASIONALLY VENTURED TO HINT A SMALL PART OF WHAT THEY FELT DURING MANY YEARS THE ZEAL OF THE ENGLISH TORY FOR HEREDITARY MONARCHY
AND HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF RECEIVING THE EUCHARIST FROM THE BISHOPS OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH THOSE PROTESTANTS WHO HAD STOOD BY HIM IN HIS DIFFICULTIES AND WHO STILL CHERISHED AN AFFECTIONATE REMEMBRANCE OF HIM
THE PAPISTS CLAIMED THE DECEASED PRINCE AS THEIR PROSELYTE THE WHIGS EXECRATED HIM AS A HYPOCRITE AND A RENEGADE THE TORIES REGARDED THE REPORT OF HIS APOSTASY
BEGINNING TO RISE TOWARDS SUNDOWN JUST WHEN THE STREAMS ON THE FOUNTAINS ARE BEGINNING TO DIMINISH THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME OF THE DAILY RISE AND FALL BEING CAUSED BY THE DISTANCE THE UPPER FLOOD STREAMS HAVE TO TRAVEL BEFORE REACHING THE VALLEY
STORM SUCCEEDS STORM HEAPING SNOW ON SNOW UNTIL THIRTY TO FIFTY FEET HAS FALLEN BUT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS SETTLING AND COMPACTING AND WASTE FROM MELTING AND EVAPORATION
WAS A MAN NAMED JAMES BURTON BY HIS OWN CONFESSION HE HAD BEEN PRESENT WHEN THE DESIGN OF ASSASSINATION WAS DISCUSSED BY HIS ACCOMPLICES WHEN THE CONSPIRACY WAS DETECTED A REWARD WAS OFFERED FOR HIS APPREHENSION
PROTECTED BY ENTAIL AGAINST FORFEITURE IN THE CASE OF GREY AND OF MEN SITUATED LIKE HIM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GRATIFY CRUELTY AND RAPACITY AT ONCE BUT A RICH TRADER MIGHT BE BOTH HANGED AND PLUNDERED
READILY FOUND A VERDICT OF GUILTY AND IN SPITE OF THE INDIGNANT MURMURS OF THE PUBLIC CORNISH SUFFERED DEATH WITHIN TEN DAYS AFTER HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED THAT NO CIRCUMSTANCE OF DEGRADATION MIGHT BE WANTING
THEN THE DENSE MASSES ON THE ENDS OF THE LEAFY BRANCHES BEGIN TO SHIFT AND FALL THOSE FROM THE UPPER BRANCHES STRIKING THE LOWER ONES IN SUCCESSION ENVELOPING EACH TREE IN A HOLLOW CONICAL AVALANCHE OF FAIRY FINENESS
HE ORDERED THESE TRACTS TO BE PRINTED WITH THE UTMOST POMP OF TYPOGRAPHY AND APPENDED TO THEM A DECLARATION ATTESTED BY HIS SIGN MANUAL AND CERTIFYING THAT THE ORIGINALS WERE IN HIS BROTHER'S OWN HAND
HE MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN PRIVY TO THE WHIG PLOT BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ONE OF THE LEADING CONSPIRATORS FOR IN THE GREAT MASS OF DEPOSITIONS PUBLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT HIS NAME OCCURS ONLY ONCE AND THEN NOT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CRIME
AND BURROWING MARMOTS MOUNTAIN BEAVERS WOOD RATS AND OTHER SMALL MOUNTAIN PEOPLE GO INTO WINTER QUARTERS SOME OF THEM NOT AGAIN TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY UNTIL THE GENERAL AWAKENING AND RESURRECTION OF THE SPRING
BUT JAMES SUPPOSED THAT THE PRIMATE WAS STRUCK DUMB BY THE IRRESISTIBLE FORCE OF REASON AND EAGERLY CHALLENGED HIS GRACE TO PRODUCE WITH THE HELP OF THE WHOLE EPISCOPAL BENCH A SATISFACTORY REPLY
TWO PAPERS IN WHICH WERE SET FORTH VERY CONCISELY THE ARGUMENTS ORDINARILY USED BY ROMAN CATHOLICS IN CONTROVERSY WITH PROTESTANTS HAD BEEN FOUND IN CHARLES'S STRONG BOX
WITH THESE DISTINGUISHED LEADERS ALL THE NOBLEST AND MOST OPULENT MEMBERS OF THEIR CHURCH CONCURRED EXCEPT LORD ARUNDELL OF WARDOUR AN OLD MAN
THEY ARE NOW FED ONLY BY SMALL SPRINGS WHOSE WATERS ARE MOSTLY EVAPORATED IN PASSING OVER MILES OF WARM PAVEMENTS AND IN FEELING THEIR WAY SLOWLY FROM POOL TO POOL THROUGH THE MIDST OF BOULDERS AND SAND
A RIDE ON AN AVALANCHE FEW YOSEMITE VISITORS EVER SEE SNOW AVALANCHES AND FEWER STILL KNOW THE EXHILARATION OF RIDING ON THEM
IN THAT THEY WERE IMPLACABLE ENEMIES OF THAT GOOD CAUSE WHICH WOULD YET REVIVE AND FLOURISH SHE LEFT THEM TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE KING OF KINGS TO THE LAST SHE PRESERVED A TRANQUIL COURAGE WHICH REMINDED THE SPECTATORS OF THE MOST HEROIC DEATHS
RUNNING AND SINGING SOON AFTER SUNRISE LOUDER AND LOUDER WITH INCREASING VOLUME UNTIL SUNDOWN THEN THEY GRADUALLY FAIL THROUGH THE FROSTY HOURS OF THE NIGHT
SUSPECTED AND WHISPERED BUT NOT FORMALLY ANNOUNCED THE DISCLOSURE INDEED COULD NOT BE MADE WITHOUT GREAT SCANDAL CHARLES HAD TIMES WITHOUT NUMBER DECLARED HIMSELF A PROTESTANT
HAD THOUGHT THAT ON THIS POINT IT WAS ADVISABLE TO BE CAUTIOUS AND HAD NOT VENTURED TO INTER HIS BROTHER WITH THE RITES OF THE CHURCH OF ROME FOR A TIME THEREFORE EVERY MAN WAS AT LIBERTY TO BELIEVE WHAT HE WISHED
SUFFERED DEATH IN CHEAPSIDE SHE LEFT A PAPER WRITTEN INDEED IN NO GRACEFUL STYLE YET SUCH AS WAS READ BY MANY THOUSANDS WITH COMPASSION AND HORROR MY FAULT SHE SAID
WHERE UNDER ORDINARY WEATHER CONDITIONS THE SNOW ACCUMULATED FROM WINTER TO WINTER LIES AT REST FOR MANY YEARS ALLOWING TREES FIFTY TO A HUNDRED FEET HIGH TO GROW UNDISTURBED ON THE SLOPES BENEATH THEM
THE AVERAGE DEPTH ACTUALLY FOUND AT ANY TIME SELDOM EXCEEDS TEN FEET IN THE FOREST REGIONS OR FIFTEEN FEET ALONG THE SLOPES OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS AFTER SNOW STORMS COME AVALANCHES
AND I WAS SWISHED DOWN TO THE FOOT OF THE CANYON AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT THE WALLOWING ASCENT HAD TAKEN NEARLY ALL DAY THE DESCENT ONLY ABOUT A MINUTE WHEN THE AVALANCHE STARTED
AGAINST THE INIQUITY WHICH AFFLICTED THE EARTH SINCE THAT TERRIBLE DAY NO WOMAN HAS SUFFERED DEATH IN ENGLAND
BESIDES THESE COMMON AFTER STORM AVALANCHES THAT ARE TO BE FOUND NOT ONLY IN THE YOSEMITE BUT IN ALL THE DEEP SHEER WALLED CANYON OF THE RANGE THERE ARE TWO OTHER IMPORTANT KINDS
HAD A LARGE CHARITY HER LIFE WAS PASSED IN RELIEVING THE UNHAPPY OF ALL RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS AND SHE WAS WELL KNOWN
SUCH WERE THE SENTIMENTS OF THE KING'S TWO KINSMEN THE EARLS OF CLARENDON AND ROCHESTER THE POWER AND FAVOUR OF THESE NOBLEMEN SEEMED TO BE GREAT INDEED
LEAPING FROM BENCH TO BENCH SPREADING AND NARROWING AND THROWING OFF CLOUDS OF WHIRLING DUST LIKE THE SPRAY OF FOAMING CATARACTS COMPARED WITH WATERFALLS AND CASCADES
IN ALL MY MOUNTAINEERING I HAVE ENJOYED ONLY ONE AVALANCHE RIDE AND THE START WAS SO SUDDEN AND THE END CAME SO SOON I HAD BUT LITTLE TIME TO THINK OF THE DANGER THAT ATTENDS THIS SORT OF TRAVEL
AND HAD OF HIS OWN ACCORD
THE GIBBET WAS SET UP WHERE KING STREET MEETS CHEAPSIDE IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE WHERE HE HAD LONG LIVED IN GENERAL RESPECT OF THE EXCHANGE WHERE HIS CREDIT HAD ALWAYS STOOD HIGH AND OF THE GUILDHALL WHERE HE HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS A POPULAR LEADER
HAD THE HEART AND THE FOREHEAD TO APPEAR AS THE PRINCIPAL WITNESS AGAINST THEM THEY WERE CONVICTED FERNLEY WAS SENTENCED TO THE GALLOWS ELIZABETH GAUNT TO THE STAKE EVEN AFTER ALL THE HORRORS OF THAT YEAR
BY PREMATURELY ATTEMPTING TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE PRIVY COUNCIL AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS MIGHT LOSE THEIR MANSIONS AND THEIR AMPLE ESTATES AND MIGHT END THEIR LIVES AS TRAITORS ON TOWER HILL OR AS BEGGARS
MIGHT ONE DAY BE FOUND TO BE NOT ONLY DISTINCT BUT INCOMPATIBLE FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE STUARTS AND THE COMMONS THE CAUSE OF THE CROWN AND THE CAUSE OF THE HIERARCHY HAD TO ALL APPEARANCE
HE WAS SAVED FROM DEATH BY AN ANCIENT MATRON OF THE BAPTIST PERSUASION NAMED ELIZABETH GAUNT THIS WOMAN
BOTH WERE IMPELLED BY THE STRONGEST PRESSURE OF HOPE END FEAR TO CRIMINATE HIM EVIDENCE WAS PRODUCED
THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY A CRUEL EXPERIENCE THAT THE ANTIPATHY OF THE NATION TO THEIR RELIGION WAS NOT A FANCY WHICH WOULD YIELD TO THE MANDATE OF A PRINCE BUT A PROFOUND SENTIMENT
RUMSEY'S STORY WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE STORY WHICH HE HAD TOLD WHEN HE APPEARED AS A WITNESS AGAINST LORD RUSSELL BUT THESE THINGS WERE URGED IN VAIN ON THE BENCH SATE THREE JUDGES WHO HAD BEEN WITH JEFFREYS IN THE WEST
RUNNING CRYSTAL CLEAR DEEP AND FULL BUT NOT OVERFLOWING THEIR BANKS ABOUT AS DEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT AS THE DAY THE DIFFERENCE IN VOLUME SO MARKED IN SPRING BEING NOW TOO SLIGHT TO BE NOTICED
WHERE THE SLOPES ARE INCLINED AT AN ANGLE TOO LOW TO SHED OFF THE DRY WINTER SNOW AND WHICH ACCUMULATES UNTIL THE SPRING THAWS SAP THEIR FOUNDATIONS AND MAKE THEM SLIPPERY
BORDERING ON HIGH TREASON FROM HIS INDICTMENT AND FROM THE SCANTY ACCOUNT WHICH REMAINS OF HIS TRIAL IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT HE WAS NOT EVEN ACCUSED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE DESIGN OF MURDERING THE ROYAL BROTHERS THE MALIGNITY WITH WHICH SO OBSCURE A MAN
BUT HE HAD STILL TO LISTEN TO REMONSTRANCES SIMILAR IN EFFECT THOUGH UTTERED IN A TONE EVEN MORE CAUTIOUS AND SUBDUED SOME MEN WHO HAD HITHERTO SERVED HIM BUT TOO STRENUOUSLY FOR THEIR OWN FAME AND FOR THE PUBLIC WELFARE
NONE WHO FELT THUS COULD HAVE WATCHED WITHOUT DEEP CONCERN AND GLOOMY FOREBODINGS THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE KING AND THE PARLIAMENT ON THE SUBJECT OF THE TEST
MANY THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT THESE JUDGMENTS SHOULD BE CARRIED INTO EXECUTION BUT THE KING WAS WITHOUT PITY FERNLEY WAS HANGED ELIZABETH GAUNT WAS BURNED ALIVE AT TYBURN ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH CORNISH
WHOM HE SUPPOSED TO BE OF HIS OWN RELIGIOUS PERSUASION AND ASSURED HER THAT SHE WOULD BE GREATLY EDIFIED AND COMFORTED BY THE PERUSAL IN REQUITAL OF HIS KINDNESS SHE DELIVERED TO HIM A FEW DAYS LATER
IS A TASTE WHICH EVEN MEN NOT NATURALLY CRUEL MAY BY HABIT SPEEDILY ACQUIRE THE BAR AND THE BENCH UNITED TO BROWBEAT THE UNFORTUNATE WHIG THE JURY NAMED BY A COURTLY SHERIFF
HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE DOCUMENTS TO WHICH HE ATTACHED SO MUCH VALUE MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMPOSED BY ANY LAD OF FIFTEEN
NEARLY ALL THE WEATHER IS CLOUDLESS AND EVERYTHING IS AT ITS BRIGHTEST LAKE RIVER GARDEN AND FOREST WITH ALL THEIR LIFE MOST OF THE PLANTS ARE IN FULL FLOWER
THERE WAS SCARCELY ONE EMINENT PEER ATTACHED TO THE OLD FAITH WHOSE HONOUR WHOSE ESTATE WHOSE LIFE HAD NOT BEEN IN JEOPARDY WHO HAD NOT PASSED MONTHS IN THE TOWER
TO TYBURN IN ORDER TO SEE ELIZABETH GAUNT BURNED HE AFTERWARDS RELATED THAT WHEN SHE CALMLY DISPOSED THE STRAW ABOUT HER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO SHORTEN HER SUFFERINGS ALL THE BYSTANDERS BURST INTO TEARS
AT THE PORCHES OF ITALIAN CONVENTS SUCH WAS THE FEELING OF WILLIAM HERBERT EARL OF POWIS WHO WAS GENERALLY REGARDED AS THE CHIEF OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARISTOCRACY
THE COMMERCIAL GRANDEES HOWEVER THOUGH IN GENERAL HOSTILE TO POPERY AND TO ARBITRARY POWER HAD YET BEEN TOO SCRUPULOUS OR TOO TIMID TO INCUR THE GUILT OF HIGH TREASON ONE OF THE MOST CONSIDERABLE AMONG THEM
AND OF THE TYRANNY OF HIM THE GREAT ONE OF ALL TO WHOSE PLEASURE SHE AND SO MANY OTHER VICTIMS HAD BEEN SACRIFICED IN SO FAR AS THEY HAD INJURED HERSELF SHE FORGAVE THEM BUT
HE HAD INDEED WHEN SHERIFF BEEN VERY UNWILLING TO EMPLOY AS HIS DEPUTY A MAN SO VIOLENT AND UNPRINCIPLED AS GOODENOUGH WHEN THE RYE HOUSE PLOT WAS DISCOVERED GREAT HOPES WERE ENTERTAINED AT WHITEHALL THAT CORNISH WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CONCERNED
AND PILING THEIR UPROOTED TREES HEAD DOWNWARD IN ROWS ALONG THE SIDES OF THE GAPS LIKE LATERAL MORAINES SCARS AND BROKEN BRANCHES OF THE TREES STANDING ON THE SIDES OF THE GAPS RECORD THE DEPTH OF THE OVERWHELMING FLOOD
HE WAS DRUNK THEY SAID OR OUT OF HIS MIND WHEN HE WAS TURNED OFF
IT WAS MUCH NOTICED THAT WHILE THE FOULEST JUDICIAL MURDER WHICH HAD DISGRACED EVEN THOSE TIMES WAS PERPETRATING A TEMPEST BURST FORTH SUCH AS HAD NOT BEEN KNOWN SINCE THAT GREAT HURRICANE WHICH HAD RAGED ROUND THE DEATHBED OF OLIVER
BEFORE THE SUNSHINE HAD TIME TO CHANGE THEM I SET OUT EARLY TO CLIMB BY A SIDE CANYON TO THE TOP OF A COMMANDING RIDGE A LITTLE OVER THREE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE VALLEY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LOOSENESS OF THE SNOW THAT BLOCKED THE CANYON
I KNEW THE CLIMB WOULD REQUIRE A LONG TIME SOME THREE OR FOUR HOURS AS I ESTIMATED BUT IT PROVED FAR MORE DIFFICULT THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED MOST OF THE WAY I SANK WAIST DEEP
COULD NOT BE FALSE TO THE OTHER SHOULD BE DIVIDED BY A DEADLY ENMITY WHAT COURSE WAS THE ORTHODOX ROYALIST TO TAKE WHAT SITUATION COULD BE MORE TRYING THAN THAT IN WHICH HE WOULD BE PLACED
AND AS THE WHOLE MASS BENEATH AND ABOUT ME JOINED IN THE FLIGHT THERE WAS NO FRICTION THOUGH I WAS TOSSED HERE AND THERE AND LURCHED FROM SIDE TO SIDE WHEN THE AVALANCHE SWEDGED AND CAME TO REST
NOT TO BE FORGIVEN BATEMAN WAS ARRESTED AND INDICTED THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM WERE MEN OF INFAMOUS CHARACTER MEN TOO WHO WERE SWEARING FOR THEIR OWN LIVES NONE OF THEM HAD YET GOT HIS PARDON
AND IT WAS A POPULAR SAYING THAT THEY FISHED FOR PREY LIKE TAME CORMORANTS WITH ROPES ROUND THEIR NECKS THE PRISONER STUPEFIED BY ILLNESS WAS UNABLE TO ARTICULATE OR TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PASSED HIS SON AND DAUGHTER
MUST BE FILLED WITH SHAME AND INDIGNATION BY LEARNING THAT HIS WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN A LIE THAT WHILE HE PROFESSED TO BELONG TO THEIR COMMUNION HE HAD REALLY REGARDED THEM AS HERETICS
THESE STATESMEN AND THE GREAT PARTY WHICH THEY REPRESENTED HAD TO SUFFER A CRUEL MORTIFICATION THAT THE LATE KING HAD BEEN AT HEART A ROMAN CATHOLIC HAD BEEN DURING SOME MONTHS
GUILTY OF SO SLIGHT AN OFFENCE WAS HUNTED DOWN WHILE TRAITORS FAR MORE CRIMINAL AND FAR MORE EMINENT WERE ALLOWED TO RANSOM THEMSELVES BY GIVING EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM SEEMED TO REQUIRE EXPLANATION AND A DISGRACEFUL EXPLANATION WAS FOUND
ON THEIR WAY DOWN THROUGH THE WOODS THEY SELDOM FAIL TO MAKE A PERFECTLY CLEAN SWEEP STRIPPING OFF THE SOIL AS WELL AS THE TREES CLEARING PATHS TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS WIDE FROM THE TIMBER LINE
AND APPEARED TO BE IN HIS HANDWRITING THESE PAPERS JAMES SHOWED TRIUMPHANTLY TO SEVERAL PROTESTANTS AND DECLARED THAT TO HIS KNOWLEDGE HIS BROTHER HAD LIVED AND DIED
FOR THE MEMORY OF HIS DECEASED MASTER THIS PLEA THE KING CONSIDERED AS THE SUBTERFUGE
SHE REMAINED THOUGHTFUL AND BEGAN HER WORK AT THE EXPIRATION OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE LEFT HER SEWING
WHAT SPLENDID HAIR EXCLAIMED THE BARBER HOW MUCH WILL YOU GIVE ME FOR IT SAID SHE
SAID TO HER INCESSANTLY WHEN WILL YOU PAY ME YOU HUSSY WHAT DID THEY WANT OF HER GOOD GOD SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS BEING HUNTED AND SOMETHING OF THE WILD BEAST DEVELOPED IN HER ABOUT THE SAME TIME THENARDIER WROTE TO HER THAT HE HAD WAITED WITH DECIDEDLY TOO MUCH AMIABILITY
SAID EMERSON SPELT WITH A P I SUPPOSE SAID SHAKESPEARE P S H A W PSHAW M U T MUT PSHAWMUT SO CALLED BECAUSE THE INHABITANTS ARE ALWAYS MUTTERING PSHAW EH PRETTY GOOD SAID JOHNSON
TURN THE LIBRARY SOFAS INTO BENCHES AND GO PEGGING AWAY AT BOOT MAKING SO WHY SHOULD YOU LET THE POETS TURN THE PLACE INTO A VERSE FACTORY THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW I DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN SAID BLACKSTONE
ARE THE FRONT TEETH THE TWO UPPER ONES HOW HORRIBLE EXCLAIMED FANTINE TWO NAPOLEONS GRUMBLED A TOOTHLESS OLD WOMAN WHO WAS PRESENT
I THINK THE POETS CORNER ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY SAID CONFUCIUS THIS ISN'T A CLASS ORGANIZATION AND WE SHOULD RESIST ANY EFFORT TO MAKE IT OR ANY PORTION OF IT SO
PULL OUT MY TWO FRONT TEETH WHY I SHOULD BE HORRIBLE MY HAIR WILL GROW AGAIN BUT MY TEETH AH WHAT A MONSTER OF A MAN I SHOULD PREFER TO THROW MYSELF HEAD FIRST ON THE PAVEMENT FROM THE FIFTH STORY
THOUGH I CAN'T SAY I THINK YOUR PARALLELS ARE VERY PARALLEL A SHOEMAKER MY DEAR CONFUCIUS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM A POET CERTAINLY SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON VERY DIFFERENT IN FACT DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO MAKE A CONUNDRUM OF THE QUESTION
BUT I SUPPOSE COMPLAINT BOOKS ARE THE PLACES FOR COMPLAINTS YOU DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO WRITE SERIAL STORIES OR DIALECT POEMS IN THEM DO YOU THAT ISN'T THE POINT AS THE MAN SAID TO THE ASSASSIN WHO TRIED TO STAB HIM WITH THE HILT OF HIS DAGGER
AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE VINGT ET UN AND OTHER PLAYERS SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM THE WOOERS OF THE MUSE I'LL VOTE TO HAVE THE POETS CORNER AND IN IT I MOVE THAT CASSIUS'S SLATE IDEA BE CARRIED OUT IT WILL BE A GREAT SAVING
NOW I ASK YOU GENTLEMEN IF THESE THINGS ARE TO BE TOLERATED ARE THEY NOT RATHER TO BE REPREHENDED WHETHER I AM A CHINAMAN OR NOT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO THEN ASKED SIR WALTER RALEIGH A LITTLE NETTLED
IT SHOWED IN SHAKESPEARE'S ESTIMATION HIS ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE OF THOSE DULL PERSONS WHO SUPPOSED THAT IN THEM WAS CENTRED THE DESTINY OF ALL MANKIND THE FATES HOWEVER ONLY SMILED AT THESE LITTLE ACTS OF REBELLION
SHE PUT ON LITTLE ROUND CAPS WHICH CONCEALED HER SHORN HEAD AND IN WHICH SHE WAS STILL PRETTY DARK THOUGHTS HELD POSSESSION OF FANTINE'S HEART WHEN SHE SAW THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER DRESS HER HAIR
YES SAID FANTINE
LORD BACON ACCOMPANIED BY CHARON AND THE ICE FOR NERO AND THE ALE FOR DOCTOR JOHNSON APPEARED AS SHAKESPEARE SPOKE THE PHILOSOPHER BOWED STIFFLY AT DOCTOR JOHNSON AS THOUGH HE HARDLY APPROVED OF HIM EXTENDED HIS LEFT HAND TO SHAKESPEARE
GET SOME ICE FOR THE EMPEROR AND ASK LORD BACON TO STEP DOWN HERE A MINUTE I DON'T WANT ANY ICE SAID NERO NOT NOW RETORTED SHAKESPEARE BUT YOU WILL IN A FEW MINUTES WHEN WE HAVE FINISHED WITH YOU YOU'LL WANT AN ICEBERG
IT IS A MALADY THAT ONE GETS WITHOUT KNOWING HOW THEN IT ATTACKS CHILDREN CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR DO PEOPLE DIE OF IT THEY MAY SAID MARGUERITE
JUST TO SHOW THE FATES THAT HE DIDN'T CARE A TUPPENCE FOR THEIR VERDICT AS REGISTERED THROUGH THE OBOLUS IT WAS A PECULIAR CUSTOM OF SHAKESPEARE'S TO TOSS UP A COIN TO DECIDE QUESTIONS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE AND THEN DO THE THING THE COIN DECIDED HE SHOULD NOT DO
FANTINE RETURNED HOME SHE WAS FURIOUS AND RELATED THE OCCURRENCE TO HER GOOD NEIGHBOR MARGUERITE CAN YOU UNDERSTAND SUCH A THING IS HE NOT AN ABOMINABLE MAN HOW CAN THEY ALLOW SUCH PEOPLE TO GO ABOUT THE COUNTRY
CHAPTER TEN RESULT OF THE SUCCESS SHE HAD BEEN DISMISSED TOWARDS THE END OF THE WINTER THE SUMMER PASSED BUT WINTER CAME AGAIN SHORT DAYS LESS WORK WINTER NO WARMTH NO LIGHT
SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON HE'D HAVE MADE A SUPERB TRAGEDY NERO WOULD I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WAS ANY KIND OF A CRIME HE LEFT UNCOMMITTED WAS THERE EMPEROR YES I NEVER WROTE AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY RETURNED THE EMPEROR DRYLY
THE LITTLE ONE WILL BE DEAD SHE BURST OUT LAUGHING AND SAID TO HER OLD NEIGHBOR
CUT IT OFF SHE PURCHASED A KNITTED PETTICOAT
AND WHAT WAS THE FIRST SIGHT THAT GREETED OUR EYES I GIVE IT UP SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON IT MUST HAVE BEEN A CATACORNERED SIGHT WHATEVER IT WAS IF THE EMPEROR'S EYES SLANTED LIKE YOURS
A FRIGHTFUL SEASON WINTER CHANGES THE WATER OF HEAVEN AND THE HEART OF MAN INTO A STONE HER CREDITORS HARRASSED HER FANTINE EARNED TOO LITTLE HER DEBTS HAD INCREASED
COSETTE WAS NOT ILL FANTINE THREW HER MIRROR OUT OF THE WINDOW SHE HAD LONG SINCE QUITTED HER CELL ON THE SECOND FLOOR FOR AN ATTIC WITH ONLY A LATCH TO FASTEN IT
I GOT THEM REPLIED FANTINE AT THE SAME TIME SHE SMILED THE CANDLE ILLUMINATED HER COUNTENANCE IT WAS A BLOODY SMILE A REDDISH SALIVA SOILED THE CORNERS OF HER LIPS
FANTINE HAD GROWN TEN YEARS OLDER SINCE THE PRECEDING NIGHT JESUS SAID MARGUERITE WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU FANTINE NOTHING REPLIED FANTINE QUITE THE CONTRARY
THIS WAS EVIDENT FROM THE PERPENDICULAR WRINKLES SHE PATCHED HER BODICE WHICH WAS OLD AND WORN OUT WITH SCRAPS OF CALICO WHICH TORE AT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT THE PEOPLE TO WHOM SHE WAS INDEBTED MADE SCENES AND GAVE HER NO PEACE
I DO NOT KNOW THAT I APPROVE OF THE SUGGESTION MYSELF BUT IN ORDER TO BRING IT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR DEBATE I AM WILLING TO MAKE A MOTION THAT THE REQUEST BE GRANTED EXCUSE ME PUT IN DOCTOR JOHNSON
IF WE COULD HAVE HAD POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS IN MY DAY I MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD TO FALL ON MY SWORD TO GET OUT OF KEEPING AN ENGAGEMENT I HAD NO FANCY FOR CLASS CLUBS HAVE THEIR USES NO DOUBT SAID DEMOSTHENES
AND IN VIEW OF THE AGE OF THE COMPLAINANTS I THINK WE CANNOT WELL DECLINE TO GIVE THEM A SPECIFIC ANSWER RESPECT FOR AGE IS DE RIGUEUR AT ALL TIMES LIKE CLEAN HANDS I'LL SECOND THE MOTION
SAID CASSIUS I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT IF A DOZEN POETS GOT TO WORK ON THOSE SLATES AT ONCE A FIFE CORPS WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEM WELL IT ALL GOES TO PROVE WHAT I HAVE THOUGHT ALL ALONG SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON HOMER'S IDEA IS A GOOD ONE
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SHOEMAKER AND A POET ONE MAKES THE SHOES AND THE OTHER SHAKES THE MUSE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD STILL I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN EXCLUDE THE POETS IT IS THE VERY DEMOCRACY OF THIS CLUB THAT GIVES IT LIFE WE TAKE IN EVERYBODY
AND IT WAS COMMON GOSSIP IN EREBUS THAT ONE OF THE TRIO HAD TOLD THE FURIES THAT THEY HAD OBSERVED SHAKESPEARE'S TENDENCY TO KICK OVER THE TRACES AND ALWAYS ACTED ACCORDINGLY THEY NEVER LET THE COIN FALL SO AS TO DECIDE A QUESTION THE WAY THEY WANTED IT
SHAKESPEARE WAS MY STENOGRAPHER GENTLEMEN SAID LORD BACON IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH HE DID WRITE HAMLET LITERALLY BUT IT WAS AT MY DICTATION I DENY IT SAID SHAKESPEARE
THAT POETS MUST NOT BE INSPIRED BETWEEN THE HOURS OF ELEVEN A M AND FIVE P M OR IN THE EVENING AFTER EIGHT THAT ANY POET DISCOVERED USING MORE THAN FIVE ARM CHAIRS IN THE COMPOSITION OF A QUATRAIN WILL BE CHARGED TWO OBOLI AN HOUR FOR EACH CHAIR IN EXCESS OF THAT NUMBER
AND THAT THE BILLIARD MARKER SHALL BE REQUIRED TO CHARGE A PREMIUM OF THREE TIMES THE ORDINARY FEE FOR TABLES USED BY VERSIFIERS IN LIEU OF WRITING PADS THAT WOULDN'T BE A BAD IDEA SAID SIR WALTER RALEIGH
SHE BEGAN TO HATE EVERY ONE ABOUT HER SHE HAD LONG SHARED THE UNIVERSAL VENERATION FOR FATHER MADELEINE YET BY DINT OF REPEATING TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS HE WHO HAD DISCHARGED HER THAT HE WAS THE CAUSE OF HER UNHAPPINESS SHE CAME TO HATE HIM ALSO AND MOST OF ALL
FANTINE FLED AND STOPPED HER EARS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT HEAR THE HOARSE VOICE OF THE MAN SHOUTING TO HER REFLECT MY BEAUTY TWO NAPOLEONS THEY MAY PROVE OF SERVICE
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN MARGUERITE ENTERED FANTINE'S ROOM BEFORE DAYLIGHT FOR THEY ALWAYS WORKED TOGETHER AND IN THIS MANNER USED ONLY ONE CANDLE FOR THE TWO SHE FOUND FANTINE SEATED ON HER BED PALE AND FROZEN
I ADMIT YOU GAVE ME A SUGGESTION NOW AND THEN SO AS TO KEEP IT DULL AND HEAVY IN SPOTS SO THAT IT WOULD SEEM MORE LIKE A REAL TRAGEDY THAN A COMEDY PUNCTUATED WITH DEATHS BUT BEYOND THAT YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT I SIDE WITH SHAKESPEARE PUT IN EMERSON
I WISH I'D SAID THAT WELL TELL BOSWELL SAID SHAKESPEARE
WE DO NOT BIND OURSELVES TO YIELD TO DOCTORS AND LAWYERS AND SHOEMAKERS AND PLUMBERS IN CASE THEY SHOULD EACH WANT A CORNER TO THEMSELVES A VERY WISE IDEA SAID SIR WALTER WHEREUPON THE RESOLUTION WAS SUITABLY WORDED AND PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
WHICH REDUCED THE DAILY EARNINGS OF WORKING WOMEN TO NINE SOUS SEVENTEEN HOURS OF TOIL AND NINE SOUS A DAY HER CREDITORS WERE MORE PITILESS THAN EVER THE SECOND HAND DEALER
AND DOCTOR JOHNSON IS DOWN IN THE BILLIARD ROOM PLAYING POOL WITH NERO HA HA LAUGHED SHAKESPEARE POOL EH DOES NERO PLAY POOL NOT AS WELL AS HE DOES THE FIDDLE SIR SAID THE JANITOR WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE
AND SHAKESPEARE KNOWS IT OTHERS KNOW IT AH HERE COMES SIR WALTER RALEIGH WE'LL LEAVE IT TO HIM HE WAS COGNIZANT OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR I LEAVE IT TO NOBODY SAID SHAKESPEARE SULKILY WHAT'S THE TROUBLE ASKED RALEIGH
FOR THE ENRAGED ROMAN POISING HIS CUE ON HIGH AS THOUGH IT WERE A LANCE HURLED IT AT THE IMPERTINENT DRAMATIST WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH AND WITH SUCH ACCURACY OF AIM WITHAL THAT IT PIERCED THE SPOT BENEATH WHICH IN LIFE THE HEART OF SHAKESPEARE USED TO BEAT
FAVORABLE ASKED THE DOCTOR THEY ALL DISMISSED ME WITH A LINE SAID THE DRAMATIST SAID MY CONCEPTION OF THE PART WAS NOT SHAKESPEARIAN AND THAT'S CRITICISM
LORD THE CANDLE IS ALL BURNED OUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THEN SHE LOOKED AT FANTINE
WE ALL KNOW WILL AND HIS DROLL WAYS NO DOUBT PUT IN NERO BUT THE QUESTION OF HAMLET ALWAYS EXCITES HIM SO THAT WE'D LIKE TO HAVE IT SETTLED ONCE AND FOR ALL AS TO WHO WROTE IT BACON SAYS YOU KNOW
MOST POETS PREFER TO RUB OUT THE RIGHT WORD GROWLED CONFUCIUS BESIDES I SHALL NEVER CONSENT TO SLATES IN THIS HOUSE BOAT THE SQUEAKING OF THE PENCILS WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE POEMS THEMSELVES THAT'S TRUE
WE OUGHT TO DISCOURAGE RATHER THAN ENCOURAGE THESE POETS THEY ARE ALWAYS LITTERING THE CLUB UP WITH THEMSELVES ONLY LAST WEDNESDAY I CAME HERE WITH A GUEST NO LESS A PERSON THAN A RECENTLY DECEASED EMPEROR OF CHINA
THEY DEMAND FORTY FRANCS OF ME SO MUCH FOR YOU YOU PEASANTS
YOU PRESENT TO MY MIND A CLOSER RESEMBLANCE TO SIMPLE SIMON THAN TO SOCRATES FOR MY PART I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DID WRITE IT AND I DO BELIEVE THAT SHAKESPEARE DID I CAN TELL THAT BY THE SPELLING IN THE ORIGINAL EDITION
SHE HAD LOST HER SHAME SHE LOST HER COQUETRY A FINAL SIGN SHE WENT OUT WITH DIRTY CAPS WHETHER FROM LACK OF TIME OR FROM INDIFFERENCE SHE NO LONGER MENDED HER LINEN AS THE HEELS WORE OUT SHE DRAGGED HER STOCKINGS DOWN INTO HER SHOES
THE IDEA THAT MAKES TWO NAPOLEONS WHERE DO THEY THINK I AM TO GET THEM THESE PEASANTS ARE STUPID TRULY NEVERTHELESS SHE WENT TO A DORMER WINDOW IN THE STAIRCASE AND READ THE LETTER ONCE MORE
I FANCY WE HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT TO TAKE THE MATTER UP SAID BLACKSTONE WEARILY THOUGH I DON'T KNOW OF ANY PRECEDENT FOR SUCH ACTION
THERE'S ONE THING THIS HOUSE BOAT NEEDS WROTE HOMER IN THE COMPLAINT BOOK THAT ADORNED THE CENTRE TABLE IN THE READING ROOM AND THAT IS A POETS CORNER THERE ARE SMOKING ROOMS FOR THOSE WHO SMOKE BILLIARD ROOMS FOR THOSE WHO PLAY BILLIARDS AND A CARD ROOM FOR THOSE WHO PLAY CARDS
YOU CAN'T KILL ME SAID SHAKESPEARE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS I KNOW SEVEN DOZEN ACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES WHO ARE TRYING TO DO IT BUT THEY CAN'T
SHE FOUND THEM IN THE STREET SHE FOUND THEM AGAIN ON HER STAIRCASE SHE PASSED MANY A NIGHT WEEPING AND THINKING HER EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT AND SHE FELT A STEADY PAIN IN HER SHOULDER TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE LEFT SHOULDER BLADE SHE COUGHED A GREAT DEAL
NOW I DON'T THINK THE CLUB SHOULD FURNISH THE POETS WITH THE RAW MATERIAL FOR THEIR POEMS ANY MORE THAN TO GO BACK TO CONFUCIUS'S SHOEMAKER
THEN I ERRED THAT IS ALL SAID NERO AND I APOLOGIZE BUT REALLY MY LORD HE ADDED ADDRESSING BACON I FANCIED I DETECTED YOUR FINE ITALIAN HAND IN THAT NO I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OTHELLO SAID BACON
I WENT OVER TO BOSTON ONE NIGHT LAST WEEK AND UNKNOWN TO ANYBODY I WAYLAID A FELLOW WHO WAS TO PLAY HAMLET THAT NIGHT I DRUGGED HIM AND WENT TO THE THEATRE AND PLAYED THE PART MYSELF IT WAS THE COLDEST HOUSE YOU EVER SAW IN YOUR LIFE
GOOD SHOT SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON NONCHALANTLY
ONE OF THOSE ATTICS WHOSE EXTREMITY FORMS AN ANGLE WITH THE FLOOR AND KNOCKS YOU ON THE HEAD EVERY INSTANT THE POOR OCCUPANT CAN REACH THE END OF HIS CHAMBER AS HE CAN THE END OF HIS DESTINY ONLY BY BENDING OVER MORE AND MORE SHE HAD NO LONGER A BED
I BELIEVE IT WAS ONE OF HIS FIDDLINGS THAT SENT NATURE INTO CONVULSIONS AND CAUSED THE DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII SO THERE PUT THAT ON YOUR MUSIC RACK AND FIDDLE IT MY LITTLE EMPEROR NERO'S FACE GREW PURPLE WITH ANGER
HERE IS NOT VERY DEFINITE WHERE IS HERE IN THE COMPLAINT BOOK WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND RETURNED DEMOSTHENES PUTTING A PEBBLE IN HIS MOUTH SO THAT HE MIGHT ENUNCIATE MORE CLEARLY A FROWN RUFFLED THE SERENITY OF DOCTOR JOHNSON'S BROW
IT'S ALL RIGHT TO PULL THE WOOL OVER THE EYES OF THE MORTALS THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE THERE FOR BUT AS FOR US WE'RE ALL IN THE SECRET HERE WHAT'S THE USE OF PUTTING ON NONSENSE WITH US WE'LL SEE IN A MINUTE WHAT THE USE IS RETORTED THE AVONIAN WE'LL HAVE BACON DOWN HERE
HER COUGH DID NOT LEAVE HER AND SHE HAD SWEATS ON HER BACK
WROTE TO HER CONSTANTLY LETTERS WHOSE CONTENTS DROVE HER TO DESPAIR AND WHOSE CARRIAGE RUINED HER ONE DAY THEY WROTE TO HER THAT HER LITTLE COSETTE WAS ENTIRELY NAKED IN THAT COLD WEATHER THAT SHE NEEDED A WOOLLEN SKIRT

POETS CLUBS ARE A GOOD THING
I'VE MURDERED EVERYTHING BUT ENGLISH THOUGH I COULD HAVE MADE A FINE TRAGEDY OUT OF YOU SAID SHAKESPEARE JUST THINK WHAT A DREADFUL CLIMAX FOR A TRAGEDY IT WOULD BE JOHNSON TO HAVE NERO AS THE CURTAIN FELL PLAYING A VIOLIN SOLO

FANTINE MINGLED IN THE GROUP AND BEGAN TO LAUGH WITH THE REST AT THE HARANGUE WHICH CONTAINED SLANG FOR THE POPULACE AND JARGON FOR RESPECTABLE PEOPLE
COSETTE IS ILL WITH A MALADY WHICH IS GOING THE ROUNDS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD A MILIARY FEVER THEY CALL IT EXPENSIVE DRUGS ARE REQUIRED THIS IS RUINING US AND WE CAN NO LONGER PAY FOR THEM

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY RAW MATERIAL FOR POEMS ASKED SIR WALTER WITH A FROWN PEN INK AND PAPER WHAT ELSE SAID DEMOSTHENES DOESN'T IT TAKE BRAINS TO WRITE A POEM SAID RALEIGH
TO SAY THAT THIS MAN SHALL NOT ENTER BECAUSE HE IS THIS OR THAT OR THE OTHER THING WOULD RESULT IN OUR ULTIMATELY BECOMING A CLASS ORGANIZATION WHICH AS CONFUCIUS HIMSELF SAYS WE ARE NOT AND MUST NOT BE
AND STARED COLDLY AT NERO DID YOU SEND FOR ME WILLIAM HE ASKED LANGUIDLY I DID SAID SHAKESPEARE
AND SAMSON WAS WISE IN BACKING IT UP THE POETS NEED TO BE CONCENTRATED SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT BE A NUISANCE TO OTHER PEOPLE AND WHERE OTHER PEOPLE WILL NOT BE A NUISANCE TO THEM HOMER OUGHT TO HAVE A PLACE TO COMPOSE IN WHERE THE VINGT ET UN PLAYERS WILL NOT INTERRUPT HIS FRENZIES
HAVE ALL THE CLASS CLUBS YOU WANT BUT DO NOT MAKE ONE OF THIS AN AUTHORS CLUB WHERE NONE BUT AUTHORS ARE ADMITTED IS A GOOD THING

YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL TEETH YOU GIRL THERE WHO ARE LAUGHING IF YOU WANT TO SELL ME YOUR PALETTES I WILL GIVE YOU A GOLD NAPOLEON APIECE FOR THEM WHAT ARE MY PALETTES ASKED FANTINE THE PALETTES REPLIED THE DENTAL PROFESSOR
AND THERE STRETCHED AT FULL LENGTH ON THE POOL TABLE WAS ROBERT BURNS TRYING TO WRITE A SONNET ON THE CLOTH WITH CHALK IN LESS TIME THAN VILLON COULD TURN OUT ANOTHER WITH TWO LINES START ON THE BILLIARD TABLE WITH THE SAME WRITING MATERIALS
NO NOONDAY THE EVENING JOINING ON TO THE MORNING FOGS TWILIGHT THE WINDOW IS GRAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE CLEARLY AT IT THE SKY IS BUT A VENT HOLE THE WHOLE DAY IS A CAVERN THE SUN HAS THE AIR OF A BEGGAR
THAT'S IN THE MATTER OF STATIONERY THIS CLUB LIKE ALL OTHER WELL REGULATED CLUBS PROVIDES ITS MEMBERS WITH A SUITABLE SUPPLY OF WRITING MATERIALS
NO SAID THE SHADE OF EMERSON WHICH HAD STROLLED IN WHILE SHAKESPEARE WAS TALKING THAT ISN'T CRITICISM THAT'S BOSTON WHO DISCOVERED BOSTON ANYHOW ASKED DOCTOR JOHNSON IT WASN'T COLUMBUS WAS IT
AND WHAT DID HE OFFER ASKED MARGUERITE TWO NAPOLEONS
SO THAT UNWITTINGLY THE GREAT DRAMATIST DID THEIR WILL AFTER ALL IT WAS A PART OF THEIR PLAN THAT UPON THIS OCCASION SHAKESPEARE SHOULD PLAY POOL WITH DOCTOR JOHNSON AND THE EMPEROR NERO
THE FIDDLING EX EMPEROR NERO SAID BACON LOUDLY ENOUGH TO BE HEARD ALL ABOUT THE ROOM IS MISTAKEN WHEN HE ATTRIBUTES OTHELLO TO ME AHA MASTER NERO CRIED SHAKESPEARE TRIUMPHANTLY WHAT DID I TELL YOU
BACON SMILED AND NODDED APPROVINGLY AT THE BLUSHING AVONIAN

MY CHILD WILL NOT DIE OF THAT FRIGHTFUL MALADY FOR LACK OF SUCCOR I AM CONTENT SO SAYING SHE POINTED OUT TO THE SPINSTER TWO NAPOLEONS WHICH WERE GLITTERING ON THE TABLE AH JESUS GOD
IN ALL THE CLUBS I HAVE KNOWN THE HOUSE COMMITTEES HAVE INVARIABLY TAKEN THE GROUND THAT THE COMPLAINT BOOK WAS ESTABLISHED TO GUARD THEM AGAINST THE ANNOYANCE OF HEARING COMPLAINTS THIS ONE HOWEVER HAS BEEN FORCED UPON US BY OUR SECRETARY
THOUGHT FANTINE BUT IN WHAT TRADE CAN ONE EARN A HUNDRED SOUS A DAY COME SAID SHE LET US SELL WHAT IS LEFT
I'M GETTING TIRED OF THIS IDIOTIC TALK ABOUT NOT HAVING WRITTEN MY OWN WORKS THERE'S ONE THING ABOUT NERO'S MUSIC THAT I'VE NEVER SAID BECAUSE I HAVEN'T WANTED TO HURT HIS FEELINGS BUT SINCE HE HAS CHOSEN TO CAST ASPERSIONS UPON MY HONESTY I HAVEN'T ANY HESITATION IN SAYING IT NOW
THE LOWER SHE DESCENDED THE DARKER EVERYTHING GREW ABOUT HER THE MORE RADIANT SHONE THAT LITTLE ANGEL AT THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART SHE SAID WHEN I GET RICH I WILL HAVE MY COSETTE WITH ME AND SHE LAUGHED
OTHERWISE HE WOULD TURN LITTLE COSETTE OUT OF DOORS CONVALESCENT AS SHE WAS FROM HER HEAVY ILLNESS INTO THE COLD AND THE STREETS AND THAT SHE MIGHT DO WHAT SHE LIKED WITH HERSELF AND DIE IF SHE CHOSE
I AS A POET WOULD NOT OBJECT TO THAT I DO ALL MY WORK AT HOME ANYHOW THERE'S ANOTHER PHASE OF THIS BUSINESS THAT WE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED YET AND IT'S RATHER IMPORTANT SAID DEMOSTHENES
CHARON INFORMS ME THAT THE WASTE BASKETS LAST WEEK TURNED OUT FORTY TWO REAMS OF OUR BEST CORRESPONDENCE PAPER ON WHICH THESE POETS HAD SCRIBBLED THE FIRST DRAFT OF THEIR VERSES
A PLUMBERS CLUB FOR INSTANCE AND HOW ABSURD THAT WOULD BE IN HADES NO GENTLEMEN IT CAN'T BE DONE THE POETS MUST AND SHALL BE PRESERVED WHAT'S THE OBJECTION TO CLASS CLUBS ANYHOW ASKED CASSIUS I DON'T OBJECT TO THEM

A DISPUTED AUTHORSHIP HOW ARE YOU CHARON SAID SHAKESPEARE AS THE JANITOR ASSISTED HIM ON BOARD ANY ONE HERE TO NIGHT YES SIR SAID CHARON LORD BACON IS UP IN THE LIBRARY
I DO NOT SMOKE I CAN'T PLAY BILLIARDS AND I DO NOT KNOW A TREY OF DIAMONDS FROM A SILVER SALVER ALL I CAN DO IS WRITE POETRY WHY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ME BY ALL MEANS LET US HAVE A POETS CORNER WHERE A MAN CAN BE INSPIRED IN PEACE
WE MUST STICK TO OUR ORIGINAL IDEA THEN LET US DO SOMETHING TO ABATE THE NUISANCE OF WHICH I COMPLAIN SAID CONFUCIUS CAN'T WE ADOPT A HOUSE RULE
WITH THE PACKAGES WHILE NOAH HELD THE DOOR OPEN AND WATCHED HER OUT SHE'S KEPT TOLERABLY WELL UNDER AIN'T SHE HE ASKED AS HE RESUMED HIS SEAT IN THE TONE OF A KEEPER WHO HAD TAMED SOME WILD ANIMAL
HE GRADUALLY RELENTED AND SAID HE THOUGHT THAT WOULD SUIT HIM BUT YER SEE OBSERVED NOAH AS SHE WILL BE ABLE TO DO A GOOD DEAL I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE SOMETHING VERY LIGHT A LITTLE FANCY WORK
I'M IN THAT WAY MYSELF AND I LIKE YOU FOR IT IN WHAT WAY ASKED MISTER CLAYPOLE A LITTLE RECOVERING IN THAT WAY OF BUSINESS REJOINED FAGIN AND SO ARE THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE
NO SAID MISTER WEGG WHO WAS GROWING RESTIVE UNDER THIS EXAMINATION I NEVER DID HEAR OF THE NAME OF BOFFIN DO YOU LIKE IT WHY NO
HE CROSSED INTO SAINT JOHN'S ROAD AND WAS SOON DEEP IN THE OBSCURITY OF THE INTRICATE AND DIRTY WAYS WHICH LYING BETWEEN GRAY'S INN LANE AND SMITHFIELD RENDER THAT PART OF THE TOWN ONE OF THE LOWEST AND WORST THAT IMPROVEMENT HAS LEFT IN THE MIDST OF LONDON
IS IT MUCH FARTHER ASKED THE WOMAN
POCKETS WOMEN'S RIDICULES HOUSES MAIL COACHES BANKS SAID MISTER CLAYPOLE RISING WITH THE PORTER BUT YOU CAN'T DO ALL THAT DEAR SAID CHARLOTTE
IT IS EXPEDIENT THAT THIS HISTORY SHOULD BESTOW SOME ATTENTION THEY WERE A MAN AND WOMAN OR PERHAPS THEY WOULD BE BETTER DESCRIBED AS A MALE AND FEMALE
SAID NOAH DISENGAGING HIMSELF WITH GREAT GRAVITY I SHOULD LIKE TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF SOME BAND AND HAVE THE WHOPPING OF EM AND FOLLERING EM ABOUT UNBEKNOWN TO THEMSELVES THAT WOULD SUIT ME IF THERE WAS GOOD PROFIT
SAID NOAH GETTING HIS LEGS BY GRADUAL DEGREES ABROAD AGAIN
WHERE THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING ERRANDS AND YOU CAN UPSET AS MANY KINCHINS AS YOU WANT ANY HOUR IN THE DAY HA HA HA WITH THIS FAGIN POKED MISTER CLAYPOLE IN THE SIDE AND THEY JOINED IN A BURST OF LAUGHTER
SAID FAGIN MY FRIEND WANTS SOMEBODY WHO WOULD DO THAT WELL VERY MUCH WHY I DID MENTION THAT AND I SHOULDN'T MIND TURNING MY HAND TO IT SOMETIMES REJOINED MISTER CLAYPOLE SLOWLY
ON SIMILAR GROUNDS HE NEVER BEHELD AN INMATE AT ANY ONE OF ITS WINDOWS BUT HE TOUCHED HIS HAT YET HE KNEW SO LITTLE ABOUT THE INMATES THAT HE GAVE THEM NAMES OF HIS OWN INVENTION AS MISS ELIZABETH MASTER GEORGE
SAID NOAH BARNEY COMPLIED BY USHERING THEM INTO A SMALL BACK ROOM AND SETTING THE REQUIRED VIANDS BEFORE THEM HAVING DONE WHICH HE INFORMED THE TRAVELLERS THAT THEY COULD BE LODGED THAT NIGHT
WHICH HAD BEEN EXPOSED FOR THE DAY'S SALE HE HAD TAKEN A TIN BOX FROM UNDER HIS STOOL TO PRODUCE A RELAY OF THOSE DREADFUL SPECIMENS AND WAS GOING TO LOOK IN AT THE LID WHEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF PAUSING OH HERE YOU ARE AGAIN
IT WAS VERY LUCKY IT WAS ONLY ME I DIDN'T TAKE IT STAMMERED NOAH NO LONGER STRETCHING OUT HIS LEGS LIKE AN INDEPENDENT GENTLEMAN BUT COILING THEM UP AS WELL AS HE COULD UNDER HIS CHAIR IT WAS ALL HER DOING
MISTER CLAYPOLE LOOKED INTO THE PORTER POT WITH AN ASPECT OF DEEP WISDOM AND HAVING WELL SHAKEN ITS CONTENTS NODDED CONDESCENDINGLY TO CHARLOTTE AND TOOK A DRAUGHT WHEREWITH HE APPEARED GREATLY REFRESHED
FAGIN APPEARED TO RECEIVE THIS COMMUNICATION WITH GREAT INTEREST MOUNTING A STOOL HE CAUTIOUSLY APPLIED HIS EYE TO THE PANE OF GLASS FROM WHICH SECRET POST HE COULD SEE MISTER CLAYPOLE
YOU'VE HIT THE RIGHT NAIL UPON THE HEAD AND ARE AS SAFE HERE AS YOU COULD BE THERE IS NOT A SAFER PLACE IN ALL THIS TOWN THAN IS THE CRIPPLES THAT IS WHEN I LIKE TO MAKE IT SO AND I HAVE TAKEN A FANCY TO YOU AND THE YOUNG WOMAN
WITH ALL THAT HAUGHTINESS AND AIR OF SUPERIORITY BECOMING NOT ONLY A MEMBER OF THE STERNER SEX BUT A GENTLEMAN WHO APPRECIATED THE DIGNITY OF A SPECIAL APPOINTMENT ON THE KINCHIN LAY
AND SETTING HIMSELF DOWN AT THE NEAREST TABLE ORDERED SOMETHING TO DRINK OF THE GRINNING BARNEY A PLEASANT NIGHT SIR
SAID THE WOMAN DESPONDINGLY NEVER MIND WHETHER THEY'RE TWO MILE OFF OR TWENTY SAID NOAH CLAYPOLE FOR HE IT WAS BUT GET UP AND COME ON OR I'LL KICK YER AND SO I GIVE YER NOTICE
AND LEFT THE AMIABLE COUPLE TO THEIR REFRESHMENT NOW THIS BACK ROOM WAS IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE BAR AND SOME STEPS LOWER SO THAT ANY PERSON CONNECTED WITH THE HOUSE UNDRAWING A SMALL CURTAIN WHICH CONCEALED A SINGLE PANE OF GLASS
MISTER WEGG MADE ANSWER IN A SORT OF DESPERATION OCCASIONED BY THE SINGULARITY OF THE QUESTION HE HASN'T REPEATED THE OTHER TO HIS KNOTTED STICK AS HE GAVE IT A HUG HE HASN'T GOT HA HA TO KEEP IT WARM
HAVING REPLACED HIS TIN BOX ACCORDINGLY DID AS HE ROSE TO BAIT HIS GINGERBREAD TRAP FOR SOME OTHER DEVOTED INFANT THE SALUTE WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH MORNING SIR MORNING MORNING CALLS ME SIR SAID MISTER WEGG TO HIMSELF
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH FAGIN FOLLOWED UP THIS REMARK BY STRIKING THE SIDE OF HIS NOSE WITH HIS RIGHT FOREFINGER A GESTURE WHICH NOAH ATTEMPTED TO IMITATE
EYEING HIS NEW FRIEND MEANWHILE WITH MINGLED FEAR AND SUSPICION I'LL TELL YOU MORE SAID FAGIN AFTER HE HAD REASSURED THE GIRL BY DINT OF FRIENDLY NODS AND MUTTERED ENCOURAGEMENTS I HAVE GOT A FRIEND
RETORTED MISTER WEGG AGAIN APPROACHING DESPERATION I CAN'T SAY I DO WHY DON'T YOU LIKE IT I DON'T KNOW WHY I DON'T RETORTED MISTER WEGG APPROACHING FRENZY BUT I DON'T AT ALL
AND DON'T YER SPEAK
TAKING COLD BEEF FROM THE DISH AND PORTER FROM THE POT AND ADMINISTERING HOMEOPATHIC DOSES OF BOTH TO CHARLOTTE WHO SAT PATIENTLY BY EATING AND DRINKING AT HIS PLEASURE AHA HE WHISPERED
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY NOT WHEN IT'S IN A NOTE YOU CAN'T GET RID OF RETORTED FAGIN NUMBER AND DATE TAKEN I SUPPOSE PAYMENT STOPPED AT THE BANK AH IT'S NOT WORTH MUCH TO HIM IT'LL HAVE TO GO ABROAD
R THREE WHAT CRIPPLES SAID CHARLOTTE THREE CRIPPLES REPEATED NOAH AND A VERY GOOD SIGN TOO NOW THEN KEEP CLOSE AT MY HEELS AND COME ALONG
I SHALL LOOK OUT TO GET INTO COMPANY WITH THEM AS CAN REPLIED NOAH THEY'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE US USEFUL SOME WAY OR ANOTHER WHY YOU YOURSELF ARE WORTH FIFTY WOMEN
AS IT WAS NOT MISTER CLAYPOLE'S HABIT TO REPOSE A BLIND AND FOOLISH CONFIDENCE IN ANYBODY IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN JUSTICE TO THAT GENTLEMAN THAT HE HAD TRUSTED CHARLOTTE TO THIS EXTENT IN ORDER THAT IF THEY WERE PURSUED
WITH HIS REMAINING FOOT IN A BASKET IN COLD WEATHER PICKING UP A LIVING ON THIS WISE EVERY MORNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK HE STUMPED TO THE CORNER CARRYING A CHAIR A CLOTHES HORSE A PAIR OF TRESTLES A BOARD A BASKET AND AN UMBRELLA
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I REMAIN YOUR HUMBLE SERVT SILAS WEGG HE HAD NOT ONLY SETTLED IT WITH HIMSELF IN COURSE OF TIME THAT HE WAS ERRAND GOER BY APPOINTMENT TO THE HOUSE AT THE CORNER THOUGH HE RECEIVED SUCH COMMISSIONS NOT
STRANGERS REPEATED THE OLD MAN
ANXIOUSLY REGARDING HIM SOMETHING IN THE SNEAKING WAY
THIS IS TO BE ACCEPTED IN A DOUBLE SENSE FOR HE CONTRIVED A BACK TO HIS WOODEN STOOL BY PLACING IT AGAINST THE LAMP POST WHEN THE WEATHER WAS WET HE PUT UP HIS UMBRELLA OVER HIS STOCK IN TRADE NOT OVER HIMSELF
OR A HOUSE OR A MAIL COACH OR A BANK IF HE DRINKS IT REGULARLY MISTER CLAYPOLE NO SOONER HEARD THIS EXTRACT FROM HIS OWN REMARKS THAN HE FELL BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED FROM THE JEW TO CHARLOTTE
BUT THIS ONCE DONE WAS QUITE SATISFACTORY AND HE RESTED PERSUADED THAT HE KNEW HIS WAY ABOUT THE HOUSE BLINDFOLD FROM THE BARRED GARRETS IN THE HIGH ROOF TO THE TWO IRON EXTINGUISHERS BEFORE THE MAIN DOOR
THAT'S ENOUGH WITHOUT ANY WHY OR BECAUSE EITHER REPLIED MISTER CLAYPOLE WITH DIGNITY WELL YOU NEEDN'T BE SO CROSS SAID HIS COMPANION A PRETTY THING IT WOULD BE
SAVE WHEN THEY STEPPED ASIDE TO ALLOW A WIDER PASSAGE FOR THE MAIL COACHES WHICH WERE WHIRLING OUT OF TOWN UNTIL THEY PASSED THROUGH HIGHGATE ARCHWAY WHEN THE FOREMOST TRAVELLER STOPPED AND CALLED IMPATIENTLY TO HIS COMPANION COME ON CAN'T YER
MISTER MORRIS BOLTER THIS IS MISSUS BOLTER MISSUS BOLTER'S HUMBLE SERVANT SAID FAGIN BOWING WITH GROTESQUE POLITENESS I HOPE I SHALL KNOW HER BETTER VERY SHORTLY DO YOU HEAR THE GENTLEMAN CHARLOTTE
AS SOME FANCIED APPEARANCE INDUCED HIM TO BELIEVE IT TOO PUBLIC FOR HIS PURPOSE AT LENGTH HE STOPPED IN FRONT OF ONE MORE HUMBLE IN APPEARANCE AND MORE DIRTY THAN ANY HE HAD YET SEEN AND HAVING CROSSED OVER AND SURVEYED IT
YER'VE GOT IT NOW CHARLOTTE YER KNOW YER HAVE NO MATTER WHO'S GOT IT OR WHO DID IT MY DEAR REPLIED FAGIN GLANCING NEVERTHELESS WITH A HAWK'S EYE AT THE GIRL AND THE TWO BUNDLES
REPLIED FAGIN SHOULD I HAVE TO HAND OVER SAID NOAH SLAPPING HIS BREECHES POCKET IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE DONE WITHOUT REPLIED FAGIN IN A MOST DECIDED MANNER
WITH A COUNTENANCE OF ASHY PALENESS AND EXCESSIVE TERROR DON'T MIND ME MY DEAR SAID FAGIN DRAWING HIS CHAIR CLOSER HA HA
SHE ASKED AFTER THEY HAD WALKED A FEW HUNDRED YARDS HOW SHOULD I KNOW REPLIED NOAH WHOSE TEMPER HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY IMPAIRED BY WALKING NEAR I HOPE
THOUGHT SILAS QUALIFYING HIS FORMER GOOD OPINION AS THE OTHER AMBLED OFF BUT IN A MOMENT HE WAS BACK AGAIN WITH THE QUESTION HOW DID YOU GET YOUR WOODEN LEG
RETURNED SILAS DRILY AND WITH RETICENCE IT'S NOT YET BROUGHT TO AN EXACT ALLOWANCE OH IT'S NOT YET BROUGHT TO AN EXACT ALLOWANCE NO IT'S NOT YET BROUGHT TO AN EXACT ALLOWANCE OH MORNING MORNING MORNING
AND A LARGE UPRIGHT BEAM THE OBSERVER HAD TO THRUST HIMSELF BUT COULD BY APPLYING HIS EAR TO THE PARTITION
CHARLOTTE SEE TO THEM BUNDLES THIS MANDATE WHICH HAD BEEN DELIVERED WITH GREAT MAJESTY WAS OBEYED WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DEMUR
LOOKING ROUND TO BARNEY I LIKE THAT FELLOW'S LOOKS HE'D BE OF USE TO US HE KNOWS HOW TO TRAIN THE GIRL ALREADY
TO BE COMPLETELY SET UP WITH A PAIR OF WOODEN LEGS IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS MISTER WEGG WAS AN OBSERVANT PERSON OR AS HE HIMSELF SAID TOOK A POWERFUL SIGHT OF NOTICE
ASKED FAGIN THERE'S A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY MADE IN SNATCHING THEIR BAGS AND PARCELS AND RUNNING ROUND THE CORNER DON'T THEY HOLLER OUT A GOOD DEAL AND SCRATCH SOMETIMES ASKED NOAH SHAKING HIS HEAD
THE MONEY MIGHT BE FOUND ON HER WHICH WOULD LEAVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF ASSERTING HIS INNOCENCE OF ANY THEFT AND WOULD GREATLY FACILITATE HIS CHANCES OF ESCAPE OF COURSE HE ENTERED AT THIS JUNCTURE
AND AS HE CROSSED THE ROAD WHILE SPEAKING AS IF FULLY PREPARED TO PUT HIS THREAT INTO EXECUTION THE WOMAN ROSE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER REMARK AND TRUDGED ONWARD BY HIS SIDE
THE LANDLORD OF THE HOUSE HAD NOT WITHDRAWN HIS EYE
THROUGH THESE STREETS NOAH CLAYPOLE WALKED DRAGGING CHARLOTTE AFTER HIM NOW STEPPING INTO THE KENNEL TO EMBRACE AT A GLANCE THE WHOLE EXTERNAL CHARACTER OF SOME SMALL PUBLIC HOUSE NOW JOGGING ON AGAIN
BLACK WATER PIPE WHICH TRAILED ITSELF OVER THE AREA DOOR INTO A DAMP STONE PASSAGE AND HAD RATHER THE AIR OF A LEECH ON THE HOUSE THAT HAD TAKEN WONDERFULLY BUT THIS WAS NO IMPEDIMENT TO HIS ARRANGING IT ACCORDING TO A PLAN OF HIS OWN
ALL STRAPPED TOGETHER SEPARATING THESE THE BOARD AND TRESTLES BECAME A COUNTER THE BASKET SUPPLIED THE FEW SMALL LOTS OF FRUIT AND SWEETS THAT HE OFFERED FOR SALE UPON IT AND BECAME A FOOT WARMER
WHICH HAD NO DISCERNIBLE INSIDE AND WAS CONSIDERED TO REPRESENT THE PENN'ORTH APPOINTED BY MAGNA CHARTA WHETHER FROM TOO MUCH EAST WIND OR NO IT WAS AN EASTERLY CORNER THE STALL THE STOCK AND THE KEEPER
OH NOW WHAT PURSUED THE OLD FELLOW IN AN INQUISITIVE MANNER CARRYING HIS KNOTTED STICK IN HIS LEFT ARM AS IF IT WERE A BABY WHAT DO THEY ALLOW YOU NOW IT'S JOB WORK THAT I DO FOR OUR HOUSE
FROM A STICK WHICH HE CARRIED OVER HIS SHOULDER A SMALL PARCEL WRAPPED IN A COMMON HANDKERCHIEF AND APPARENTLY LIGHT ENOUGH THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ADDED TO THE LENGTH OF HIS LEGS WHICH WERE OF UNUSUAL EXTENT
AND BARNEY HAD ONLY JUST RETURNED FROM MAKING THE COMMUNICATION ABOVE RELATED WHEN FAGIN IN THE COURSE OF HIS EVENING'S BUSINESS CAME INTO THE BAR TO INQUIRE AFTER SOME OF HIS YOUNG PUPILS HUSH SAID BARNEY
LOR HOW NICE IT IS TO HEAR YER SAY SO EXCLAIMED CHARLOTTE IMPRINTING A KISS UPON HIS UGLY FACE THERE THAT'LL DO DON'T YER BE TOO AFFECTIONATE IN CASE I'M CROSS WITH YER
DO YOU REMEMBER ME THEN ASKED HIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE STOPPING IN HIS AMBLE ONE SIDED BEFORE THE STALL AND SPEAKING IN A POUNDING WAY THOUGH WITH GREAT GOOD HUMOUR
MISTER WEGG REPLIED TARTLY TO THIS PERSONAL INQUIRY IN AN ACCIDENT DO YOU LIKE IT WELL I HAVEN'T GOT TO KEEP IT WARM
SHELTERLESS FRAGMENTS OF STRAW AND PAPER GOT UP REVOLVING STORMS THERE WHEN THE MAIN STREET WAS AT PEACE AND THE WATER CART AS IF IT WERE DRUNK OR SHORT SIGHTED CAME BLUNDERING AND JOLTING ROUND IT
MUCH FARTHER YER AS GOOD AS THERE SAID THE LONG LEGGED TRAMPER POINTING OUT BEFORE HIM LOOK THERE THOSE ARE THE LIGHTS OF LONDON THEY'RE A GOOD TWO MILE OFF AT LEAST
IF I HAD BEEN ANY WAY YER TOOK THE MONEY FROM THE TILL YER KNOW YER DID SAID MISTER CLAYPOLE I TOOK IT FOR YOU NOAH DEAR REJOINED CHARLOTTE DID I KEEP IT
WHAT A LAZYBONES YER ARE CHARLOTTE IT'S A HEAVY LOAD I CAN TELL YOU SAID THE FEMALE COMING UP ALMOST BREATHLESS WITH FATIGUE HEAVY WHAT ARE YER TALKING ABOUT WHAT ARE YER MADE FOR
IT GAVE YOU THE FACE ACHE TO LOOK AT HIS APPLES THE STOMACH ACHE TO LOOK AT HIS ORANGES THE TOOTH ACHE TO LOOK AT HIS NUTS
TO BE ANYTHING ELSE INQUIRED FAGIN SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS HERE LET ME HAVE A WORD WITH YOU OUTSIDE
YOU UNDERSTAND OH YES I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY REPLIED FAGIN TELLING THE TRUTH FOR ONCE GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT
SUGGESTED FAGIN AH SOMETHING OF THAT SORT REPLIED NOAH WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD SUIT ME NOW SOMETHING NOT TOO TRYING FOR THE STRENGTH AND NOT VERY DANGEROUS YOU KNOW THAT'S THE SORT OF THING
NOW I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT'LL MAKE YOU SORRY FOR THAT SAID THE STRANGER SMILING MY NAME'S BOFFIN
BUT HAD IN THE BEGINNING DIFFIDENTLY TAKEN THE CORNER UPON WHICH THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE GAVE A HOWLING CORNER IN THE WINTER TIME A DUSTY CORNER IN THE SUMMER TIME AN UNDESIRABLE CORNER AT THE BEST OF TIMES
OVER THE HOUSE ITSELF HE EXERCISED THE SAME IMAGINARY POWER AS OVER ITS INHABITANTS AND THEIR AFFAIRS HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN IT THE LENGTH OF A PIECE OF FAT
UNSTRAPPING IT FROM THE WOMAN'S SHOULDERS
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD ANSWER MY PURPOSE AIN'T THERE ANY OTHER LINE OPEN STOP SAID FAGIN LAYING HIS HAND ON NOAH'S KNEE THE KINCHIN LAY WHAT'S THAT
WITH A SUBTLE AND EAGER LOOK UPON HIS FACE THAT MIGHT HAVE APPERTAINED TO SOME OLD GOBLIN SO I MEAN TO BE A GENTLEMAN SAID MISTER CLAYPOLE KICKING OUT HIS LEGS AND CONTINUING A CONVERSATION THE COMMENCEMENT OF WHICH
AND THE RATTLE SPRUNG SOOTH TO SAY HE WAS SO WOODEN A MAN THAT HE SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN HIS WOODEN LEG NATURALLY AND RATHER SUGGESTED TO THE FANCIFUL OBSERVER THAT HE MIGHT BE EXPECTED IF HIS DEVELOPMENT RECEIVED NO UNTIMELY CHECK
HE SALUTED ALL HIS REGULAR PASSERS BY EVERY DAY AS HE SAT ON HIS STOOL BACKED UP BY THE LAMP POST AND ON THE ADAPTABLE CHARACTER OF THESE SALUTES HE GREATLY PLUMED HIMSELF THUS TO THE RECTOR HE ADDRESSED A BOW COMPOUNDED OF LAY DEFERENCE
NOT NEAR REPLIED MISTER CLAYPOLE THERE NOT NEAR SO DON'T THINK IT WHY NOT
AND HALF OF ALL THE YOUNG WOMAN EARNS REPLIED MISTER FAGIN WHETHER NOAH CLAYPOLE WHOSE RAPACITY WAS NONE OF THE LEAST COMPREHENSIVE WOULD HAVE ACCEDED EVEN TO THESE GLOWING TERMS
BUT IT WOULDN'T PAY BY ITSELF YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE OBSERVED THE JEW RUMINATING OR PRETENDING TO RUMINATE NO IT MIGHT NOT WHAT DO YOU THINK THEN ASKED NOAH
DEMANDED MISTER CLAYPOLE THE KINCHINS MY DEAR SAID FAGIN IS THE YOUNG CHILDREN THAT'S SENT ON ERRANDS BY THEIR MOTHERS WITH SIXPENCES AND SHILLINGS AND THE LAY IS JUST TO TAKE THEIR MONEY AWAY
AND IF WE COULD ONLY GET IN WITH SOME GENTLEMAN OF THIS SORT I SAY IT WOULD BE CHEAP AT THAT TWENTY POUND NOTE YOU'VE GOT ESPECIALLY AS WE DON'T VERY WELL KNOW HOW TO GET RID OF IT OURSELVES AFTER EXPRESSING THIS OPINION
THE ONLY ARTICLE IN WHICH SILAS DEALT THAT WAS NOT HARD WAS GINGERBREAD ON A CERTAIN DAY SOME WRETCHED INFANT HAVING PURCHASED THE DAMP GINGERBREAD HORSE FEARFULLY OUT OF CONDITION AND THE ADHESIVE BIRD CAGE
WITH THESE INJUNCTIONS HE PUSHED THE RATTLING DOOR WITH HIS SHOULDER AND ENTERED THE HOUSE FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANION THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE BAR BUT A YOUNG JEW WHO WITH HIS TWO ELBOWS ON THE COUNTER
INTO NO EXPLANATION OF HIS MOTIVES AND THEY WALKED ON VERY LOVINGLY TOGETHER IN PURSUANCE OF THIS CAUTIOUS PLAN MISTER CLAYPOLE WENT ON WITHOUT HALTING UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE ANGEL
THE UNFOLDED CLOTHES HORSE DISPLAYED A CHOICE COLLECTION OF HALFPENNY BALLADS AND BECAME A SCREEN AND THE STOOL PLANTED WITHIN IT BECAME HIS POST FOR THE REST OF THE DAY ALL WEATHERS SAW THE MAN AT THE POST

AS IF REPROACHING HER TARDINESS AND URGING HER TO GREATER EXERTION THUS THEY HAD TOILED ALONG THE DUSTY ROAD TAKING LITTLE HEED OF ANY OBJECT WITHIN SIGHT
NOW
HALF A DOZEN TIMES IN A YEAR AND THEN ONLY AS SOME SERVANT'S DEPUTY BUT ALSO THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE HOUSE'S RETAINERS AND OWED VASSALAGE TO IT AND WAS BOUND TO LEAL AND LOYAL INTEREST IN IT FOR THIS REASON

AT LEAST SO HE HAD SETTLED IT HE PUT HIS OPEN HAND TO THE SIDE OF HIS HAT IN A MILITARY MANNER WHICH THAT ANGRY EYED BUTTONED UP INFLAMMATORY FACED OLD GENTLEMAN APPEARED BUT IMPERFECTLY TO APPRECIATE
TO THE DOCTOR A CONFIDENTIAL BOW AS TO A GENTLEMAN WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS INSIDE HE BEGGED RESPECTFULLY TO ACKNOWLEDGE BEFORE THE QUALITY HE DELIGHTED TO ABASE HIMSELF AND FOR UNCLE PARKER WHO WAS IN THE ARMY
WHAT'S THE WAGES LIVE LIKE A GENTLEMAN BOARD AND LODGING PIPES AND SPIRITS FREE

THE OPENING ABOVE US CLOSED AS MAGICALLY AS IT HAD OPENED AND WE SHOT DOWN UNHARMED INTO A DIMLY LIGHTED APARTMENT FAR BELOW THE ARENA AS I ROSE TO MY FEET THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS THE MALIGNANT COUNTENANCE OF ISSUS GLARING AT ME
THE FOLLOWING DAY WE CAME UPON A HERD OF SMALL THOATS AND THEREAFTER WE WERE MOUNTED AND MADE GOOD TIME WE TRAVELLED VERY FAST AND VERY FAR DUE SOUTH UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FIFTH DAY WE SIGHTED A GREAT FLEET OF BATTLESHIPS SAILING NORTH THEY SAW US BEFORE WE COULD SEEK SHELTER
THE FORMER AGREED TO TAKE SUCH VESSELS AS WE REQUIRED INTO DOCK AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE

YERSTED THAT WILL BE THE SIMPLER WAY TO RETURN I SAID SMILING AS I HANDED THE FORGED ORDER TO THE BOY COME WE SHALL SEE NOW HOW WELL IT WORKS BUT OUR SWORDS HE EXCLAIMED WHAT SHALL WE SAY TO EXPLAIN THEM
HE ALONE MAY REVIVE THE FLAGGING COURAGE OF OUR WARRIORS HE ALONE MAY SAVE THE DAY FOR OKAR WHERE IS SALENSUS OLL THE NOBLES STEPPED BACK FROM ABOUT THE DEAD BODY OF THEIR RULER AND ONE OF THEM POINTED TO THE GRINNING CORPSE
EVIDENTLY THIS SEEMED TO HIM THE EASIEST WAY OF RIDDING THE VESSEL OF MY PRESENCE AND KILLING ME AT THE SAME TIME BUT A KIND FATE INTERVENED AND BY A MIRACLE I ESCAPED WITH BUT SLIGHT BRUISES THE SHIP WAS MOVING SLOWLY AT THE TIME
I TURNED WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS TO SEIZE MY PRINCESS AND AS MY LIPS SMOTHERED HERS TO REAP THE REWARD THAT WOULD BE THRICE AMPLE PAYMENT FOR THE BLOODY ENCOUNTERS THROUGH WHICH I HAD PASSED FOR HER DEAR SAKE FROM THE SOUTH POLE TO THE NORTH
TAKING SEVERAL OF US ALONG TO DO WHATEVER WORK THERE MIGHT BE OCCASION FOR I KNOW THE ENTIRE SYSTEM PERFECTLY THERE ARE MILES OF CORRIDORS HONEYCOMBING THE GROUND BENEATH THE GARDENS AND THE TEMPLE ITSELF
CHAINED THOUGH SHE WAS STILL HAD SHE FOUGHT AGAINST THE THING THAT THEY WOULD DO TO HER AT SIGHT OF HER SALENSUS OLL ROSE AND DREW HIS SWORD
ONCE WITHIN THE PALACE I DREW SOLA TO THE DINING HALL AND WHEN SHE HAD GREETED HER FATHER AFTER THE FORMAL MANNER OF THE GREEN MEN SHE TOLD THE STORY OF THE PILGRIMAGE AND CAPTURE OF DEJAH THORIS SEVEN DAYS AGO AFTER HER AUDIENCE WITH ZAT ARRAS DEJAH THORIS ATTEMPTED TO SLIP FROM THE PALACE IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT
WITH A SNARL HE SPRANG TOWARD ME WITH NAKED SWORD BUT WHETHER SALENSUS OLL WAS A GOOD SWORDSMAN OR A POOR I NEVER LEARNED FOR WITH DEJAH THORIS AT MY BACK I WAS NO LONGER HUMAN I WAS A SUPERMAN AND NO MAN COULD HAVE WITHSTOOD ME THEN
AND MY HEART SANK WITHIN ME AS I CURSED MYSELF FOR A STUPID FOOL IN NOT HAVING SUNK THE SUBMARINE TO MAKE GOOD THE LIE THAT I MUST TELL HIS ORDERS WERE TO RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO THE TEMPLE LANDING I REPLIED
ANOTHER HELIUMETIC CITY FAR TO THE SOUTH WEST KANTOS KAN THOUGHT THAT THE DOCKS THERE IN ADDITION TO THEIR REGULAR WORK WOULD ACCOMMODATE AT LEAST SIX BATTLESHIPS AT A TIME AS HE WAS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE NAVY
BENEATH WHICH THE POOR BEAUTIFUL CREATURE WAS DRAGGED TOWARD HER DOOM A GRIM SMILE FORCED ITSELF TO MY LIPS AS I THOUGHT OF THE RUDE AWAKENING THAT LAY IN STORE FOR THE RULER OF OKAR AND MY ITCHING FINGERS FONDLED THE HILT OF MY BLOODY SWORD
FATHER OF THERNS AND PHAIDOR HIS DAUGHTER PEERING INTO THE ROOM A QUICK GLANCE ABOUT THEY TOOK THEIR EYES RESTED FOR A MOMENT WIDE IN HORROR UPON THE DEAD BODY OF SALENSUS OLL UPON THE BLOOD THAT CRIMSONED THE FLOOR UPON THE CORPSES OF THE NOBLES
HAVE I KNOWN SUCH COMPLETE ABSENCE OF LIGHT AS EXISTED IN THE PITS OF ISSUS FOR AN INSTANT I HUNG IN MID AIR THERE IS A STRANGE SENSATION CONNECTED WITH AN EXPERIENCE OF THAT NATURE WHICH IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE
BUT ANOTHER UPON ITS LEFT THEY MUST HAVE EITHER HEARD OR GUESSED WHICH WAY I WENT FOR I HAD PROCEEDED BUT A SHORT DISTANCE WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF PURSUIT I HAD NO MIND TO STOP AND FIGHT THESE MEN HERE WHEN THERE WAS FIGHTING APLENTY ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY OF KADABRA
THE PASSAGEWAY HAD RISEN RAPIDLY SINCE LEAVING THE APARTMENT OF THE SWITCH AND NOW RAN LEVEL AND WELL LIGHTED STRAIGHT INTO THE DISTANCE AS FAR AS I COULD SEE THE MOMENT THAT MY PURSUERS REACHED THIS STRAIGHT STRETCH I WOULD BE IN PLAIN SIGHT OF THEM
AND WE MAY RETURN TO THE BATTLE WHILE SHE WHO IS NOW THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM LOOKS DOWN FROM THE QUEEN'S TOWER UPON THE ANNIHILATION OF HER FORMER COUNTRYMEN AND WITNESSES THE GREATNESS
THE JEDDAK OF JEDDAKS WAS A GREAT MOUNTAIN OF A MAN A COARSE BRUTAL BEAST OF A MAN AND AS HE TOWERED ABOVE ME THERE HIS FIERCE BLACK WHISKERS AND MUSTACHE BRISTLING IN RAGE I CAN WELL IMAGINE THAT A LESS SEASONED WARRIOR MIGHT HAVE TREMBLED BEFORE HIM
ISSUS HERSELF DOES NOT DREAM
WHEN HOWEVER I SAW THE VILE HAND OF SALENSUS OLL REACH OUT FOR THE HAND OF MY BELOVED PRINCESS I COULD RESTRAIN MYSELF NO LONGER AND BEFORE THE NOBLES OF OKAR KNEW THAT AUGHT HAD HAPPENED
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY A FORCE OF YELLOW WARRIORS APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THROUGH WHICH THE MESSENGER HAD COME THEY WERE BACKING TOWARD THE APARTMENT STUBBORNLY RESISTING THE ADVANCE OF A HANDFUL OF RED MEN WHO FACED THEM AND FORCED THEM SLOWLY BUT INEVITABLY BACK
HE LAUGHED A LOW LAUGH OF PLEASURE AND RELIEF AND THEN REACHING OUT THROUGH THE INKY BLACKNESS HE SOUGHT MY SHOULDER AND PULLED MY EAR CLOSE TO HIS MOUTH NOTHING COULD BE BETTER HE WHISPERED THERE ARE SECRETS WITHIN THE SECRETS OF ISSUS OF WHICH
WHO WAS EMERGING FROM HIS OFFICE TO LEARN THE CAUSE OF THE COMMOTION THE BLACK READ THE ORDER AND FOR A MOMENT EYED US WITH EVIDENT SUSPICION
WHO HAD FALLEN THICK BEFORE THE THRONE UPON ME AND UPON THE BATTLING WARRIORS AT THE OTHER DOOR THEY DID NOT ESSAY TO ENTER THE APARTMENT BUT SCANNED ITS EVERY CORNER FROM WHERE THEY STOOD AND THEN WHEN THEIR EYES HAD SOUGHT ITS ENTIRE AREA
A GREAT SHOUT RANG THROUGH THE CORRIDOR AND FOR A MOMENT DROWNED THE NOISE OF BATTLE FOR THE PRINCE OF HELIUM THEY CRIED FOR THE PRINCE OF HELIUM AND LIKE HUNGRY LIONS UPON THEIR PREY THEY FELL ONCE MORE UPON THE WEAKENING WARRIORS OF THE NORTH
I WANTED THE MEN OF HELIUM TO SEE ME AND TO KNOW THAT THEIR BELOVED PRINCESS WAS HERE TOO FOR I KNEW THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE WOULD INSPIRE THEM TO EVEN GREATER DEEDS OF VALOR THAN THEY HAD PERFORMED IN THE PAST THOUGH GREAT INDEED MUST HAVE BEEN THOSE WHICH WON FOR THEM
AND NOTED THAT THE SOUND OF THE BATTLE ANTHEM HAD CEASED WAS DEJAH THORIS PREPARING TO TAKE HER PLACE BESIDE ME HEROIC DAUGHTER OF A HEROIC WORLD IT WOULD NOT BE UNLIKE HER TO HAVE SEIZED A SWORD AND FOUGHT AT MY SIDE
OF THE DEAD SEA BOTTOMS THAT HAD DRIVEN THEM STEP BY STEP TO THE UTTERMOST PINNACLE OF THE WORLD WHERE THEY WERE NOW INTRENCHED BEHIND AN IMPENETRABLE BARRIER OF SUPERSTITION IN ADDITION TO THE GREEN MEN THERE HAD BEEN THREE PRINCIPAL RACES UPON BARSOOM
FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME AT LEAST THEY WILL BE COMPARATIVELY SAFE HE SAID AND WE WILL AT LEAST KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR THEM
BUT SOLAN'S LAST LOUD CRY HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT EFFECT FOR A MOMENT LATER A DOZEN GUARDSMEN BURST INTO THE CHAMBER THOUGH NOT BEFORE I HAD SO BENT AND DEMOLISHED THE GREAT SWITCH THAT IT COULD NOT BE AGAIN USED TO TURN THE POWERFUL CURRENT
THE ALLOTTED HOUR HAS COME HE WAS SAYING AS I ENTERED THE APARTMENT AND THOUGH THE ENEMIES OF OKAR BE WITHIN HER GATES NAUGHT MAY STAY THE WILL OF SALENSUS OLL THE GREAT CEREMONY MUST BE OMITTED
I THANK GOD THAT YOU ARE NOT DEAD I SAID I FEARED FOR THAT NASTY CUT UPON YOUR HEAD IT BUT STUNNED ME HE REPLIED A MERE SCRATCH MAYBE IT WERE AS WELL HAD IT BEEN FINAL I SAID
AS I WATCHED THE PROCESSION THAT MOVED SLOWLY TOWARD THE THRONE A PROCESSION WHICH CONSISTED OF BUT A HANDFUL OF PRIESTS WHO FOLLOWED DEJAH THORIS AND THE TWO GUARDSMEN I CAUGHT A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF A BLACK FACE PEERING FROM BEHIND THE DRAPERIES
AS LAY WITHIN THE POWER OF MY SWORD ARM IT WAS A GLORIOUS BATTLE BUT THE END SEEMED INEVITABLE
AT SIGHT OF US THE MEMBERS OF THE GUARD SPRANG FORWARD IN SURPRISE AND WITH LEVELLED RIFLES HALTED US I HELD OUT THE MESSAGE TO ONE OF THEM HE TOOK IT AND SEEING TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED TURNED AND HANDED IT TO TORITH
AND LOOKING UP I BEHELD AT A LONG DISTANCE BEFORE US A DIM RADIANCE AS WE ADVANCED THE LIGHT INCREASED UNTIL PRESENTLY WE EMERGED INTO WELL LIGHTED PASSAGEWAYS FROM THEN ON OUR PROGRESS WAS RAPID UNTIL WE CAME SUDDENLY TO THE END OF A CORRIDOR
WHEN I REACHED IT I FOUND TO MY DELIGHT THAT IT BELONGED TO HELIUM HERE A THOAT WAS PROCURED FOR ME THE REST YOU KNOW FOR MANY MINUTES NONE SPOKE DEJAH THORIS IN THE CLUTCHES OF THE FIRST BORN I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT
WHOM IT WAS OUR PLAN TO SEND IN TRANSPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE VALLEY DOR AND THE TEMPLE OF ISSUS WHILE THE FLEET ENTERED OMEAN AND DESTROYED THE VESSELS OF THE FIRST BORN UPON HOR VASTUS DEVOLVED THE DELICATE MISSION OF ORGANISING A SECRET FORCE OF FIGHTING MEN SWORN TO FOLLOW JOHN CARTER
OF HELIUM ARE PERMITTED TO CHOOSE FAIRLY THEIR NEXT JEDDAK WHOM THEY CHOOSE MAY COUNT UPON THE LOYALTY OF MY SWORD NOR SHALL I SEEK THE HONOUR FOR MYSELF UNTIL THEN TARDOS MORS IS JEDDAK OF HELIUM
SO THAT TO ME WAS LEFT THE REMNANTS OF THE YELLOW MEN WITHIN THE THRONEROOM THEY KEPT ME BUSY TOO
A LOOK OF FIERCE RAGE OVERSPREAD THE FEATURES OF MATAI SHANG AND A COLD AND CUNNING SMILE TOUCHED THE LIPS OF PHAIDOR THEN THEY WERE GONE BUT NOT BEFORE A TAUNTING LAUGH WAS THROWN DIRECTLY IN MY FACE BY THE WOMAN
IN THE POWER OF THE FIRST BORN IT IS THE ONLY WAY I ANSWERED
UPON WHICH STOOD SALENSUS OLL AWAITING HIS BRIDE NOW THE GUARDSMEN WERE FORCING THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM UP THE FEW STEPS TO THE SIDE OF THE TYRANT OF OKAR AND I HAD NO EYES AND NO THOUGHTS FOR AUGHT ELSE A PRIEST OPENED A BOOK AND RAISING HIS HAND
TOGETHER WE RAN TO THE GARDENS BUT EVEN THOUGH WE SCOURED THE GROUNDS WITH THE ENTIRE GUARD FOR HOURS NO TRACE COULD WE FIND OF THE NIGHT MARAUDER WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT KANTOS KAN ASKED TARS TARKAS A SPY SENT BY ZAT ARRAS HE REPLIED IT WAS EVER HIS WAY
SILENTLY THEY LIFTED ME AND BORE ME TOWARD THE DOOR OF MY CHAMBER AS THEY PASSED THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH THE FARTHER MOON WAS CASTING ITS BRILLIANT BEAMS I SAW THAT EACH OF THE PARTY HAD HIS FACE SWATHED IN LAYERS OF SILK I COULD NOT RECOGNIZE ONE OF THEM
WHEN THEY HAD COME INTO THE CORRIDOR WITH ME THEY TURNED TOWARD A SECRET PANEL IN THE WALL WHICH LED TO THE PASSAGE THAT TERMINATED IN THE PITS BENEATH THE PALACE THAT ANY KNEW OF THIS PANEL OUTSIDE MY OWN HOUSEHOLD I WAS DOUBTFUL YET THE LEADER OF THE BAND DID NOT HESITATE A MOMENT
I SOON SAW THAT THEY WOULD OVERTAKE ME UNLESS I FOUND A PLACE TO CONCEAL MYSELF UNTIL THEY HAD PASSED WHICH WOULD THEN GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN THE WAY I HAD COME AND REGAIN THE TOWER OR POSSIBLY FIND A WAY TO REACH THE CITY STREETS
THROUGH THE HEAVY BARS OF A GRATED DOOR AT ONE SIDE OF THE CHAMBER RASH MORTAL SHE SHRILLED YOU SHALL PAY THE AWFUL PENALTY FOR YOUR BLASPHEMY IN THIS SECRET CELL HERE YOU SHALL LIE ALONE AND IN DARKNESS WITH THE CARCASS OF YOUR ACCOMPLICE
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT IN SOME FAR OFF CORNER OF THE PLANET THERE STILL EXISTED A REMNANT OF THE ANCIENT RACE OF YELLOW MEN MY REVERIES WERE BROKEN IN UPON BY A LOW EXCLAMATION FROM THE BOY AT LAST THE LIGHTED WAY HE CRIED
AND A MOMENT LATER MY ARMS AND LEGS SECURELY BOUND SO QUICKLY HAD THEY WORKED AND TO SUCH GOOD PURPOSE THAT I WAS UTTERLY BEYOND THE POWER TO RESIST THEM BY THE TIME I WAS FULLY AWAKE NEVER A WORD SPOKE THEY AND THE GAG EFFECTUALLY PREVENTED ME SPEAKING
THE GUARDS QUICKLY OVERCAME AND KILLED THE MAJORITY OF US HE SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY TAKE THEM TO SHADOR HE ORDERED TURNING TO ONE OF HIS SUBORDINATES
AND WHEN SHE HEARD SHE FELL UPON HER KNEES AND KISSED DEJAH THORIS FETTERED HANDS AND TOLD HER THAT THAT VERY MORNING SHE HAD BEEN WITH JOHN CARTER PRINCE OF HELIUM AND CARTHORIS HER SON DEJAH THORIS COULD NOT BELIEVE HER AT FIRST
TORITH TOOK A HALF STEP TOWARD THE ENTRANCE TO THE POOL AS THOUGH TO CORROBORATE MY STORY FOR THAT INSTANT EVERYTHING HUNG IN THE BALANCE FOR HAD HE DONE SO AND FOUND THE EMPTY SUBMARINE STILL LYING AT HER WHARF THE WHOLE WEAK FABRIC OF MY CONCOCTION
WHEREVER HE MIGHT LEAD AS WE ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE OVER A MILLION MEN TO MAN THE THOUSAND GREAT BATTLESHIPS WE INTENDED TO USE ON OMEAN AND THE TRANSPORTS FOR THE GREEN MEN AS WELL AS THE SHIPS THAT WERE TO CONVOY THE TRANSPORTS
OF THIS DYING WORLD AND SET THEM ONCE MORE TO THE LABOURS THE INTRIGUES THE MYSTERIES AND THE CRUELTIES
DEJAH THORIS KNEW THAT IT COULD BE NONE OTHER THAN THE PRINCE OF HELIUM FOR WHO SHE SAID UPON ALL BARSOOM OTHER THAN JOHN CARTER COULD HAVE DONE THE DEEDS YOU TELL OF AND WHEN THUVIA TOLD DEJAH THORIS OF HER LOVE FOR JOHN CARTER
WHERE THE BLACKS NEVER GO THERE WE MAY LIVE FOR A TIME AND WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY TRANSPIRE TO AID US TO ESCAPE HE HAD SPOKEN ALL IN A LOW WHISPER EVIDENTLY FEARING SPYING EARS EVEN HERE AND SO I ANSWERED HIM IN THE SAME SUBDUED TONE
THE YELLOW MEN CORNERED BETWEEN TWO ENEMIES FOUGHT WITH THE DESPERATION THAT UTTER HOPELESSNESS OFTEN INDUCES FOUGHT AS I SHOULD HAVE FOUGHT
ON A LEVEL FLOOR OF SOFT SAND VERY QUIETLY I LOWERED MYSELF FROM THE INKY CELL ABOVE INTO THE INKY PIT BELOW SO UTTERLY DARK WAS IT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE OUR HANDS AT AN INCH FROM OUR NOSES NEVER I THINK
AND AS ONE THEY ENLISTED WITH ME TO FOLLOW OUR BELOVED PRINCESS IN HER WANDERINGS EVEN TO THE SACRED ISS AND THE VALLEY DOR WE CAME UPON HER BUT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE PALACE WITH HER WAS FAITHFUL WOOLA THE HOUND BUT NONE OTHER
I EXPERIENCED THE SAME THRILLS AS THOUGH I WERE HANGING ABOVE A BOTTOMLESS PIT THEN I RELEASED MY HOLD AND DROPPED FOUR FEET TO A SOFT CUSHION OF SAND
IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE OUR PREPARATIONS IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE UTMOST SECRECY MUST BE MAINTAINED TO KEEP THE PROJECT FROM THE EARS OF ZAT ARRAS KANTOS KAN WAS CONFIDENT NOW THAT THE MAN'S AMBITIONS WERE FULLY AROUSED
IT WAS THE VERY BOLDNESS OF THE PLAN WHICH RENDERED IT SUCCESSFUL WERE YOU CONNECTED WITH THE RISING OF THE SLAVES ASKED TORITH WE HAVE JUST HAD MEAGRE REPORTS OF SOME SUCH EVENT ALL WERE INVOLVED I REPLIED BUT IT AMOUNTED TO LITTLE
WHERE SHE STOOD BEHIND ME BESIDE THE THRONE OF THE DEAD RULER I WONDERED WHY SHE NO LONGER URGED ME ON WITH THE STRAINS OF THE MARTIAL HYMN OF HELIUM BUT I DID NOT NEED MORE THAN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS BATTLING FOR HER TO BRING OUT THE BEST THAT IS IN ME
OF CATS WE DROPPED TOGETHER INTO THE MAIN CABIN OF THE SUBMARINE EVEN HERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE QUICKLY WE COVERED AND SECURED THE HATCH THEN THE BOY STEPPED INTO THE PILOT HOUSE TOUCHED A BUTTON AND THE BOAT SANK AMID SWIRLING WATERS TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
WITH YOU AND CARTHORIS OUT OF THE WAY THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO PREVENT HIM FROM ASSUMING THE TITLE OF JEDDAK AND YOU MAY REST ASSURED THAT SO LONG AS HE IS SUPREME HERE THERE IS NO SAFETY FOR EITHER OF YOU THERE IS A WAY CRIED HOR VASTUS TO THWART HIM EFFECTUALLY AND FOR EVER
AND IT GAVE THE RED MEN IN THE CORRIDOR BEYOND NO AVENUE OF ESCAPE SHOULD THEIR NEW ANTAGONISTS PRESS THEM TOO CLOSELY BUT I HAVE FACED HEAVIER ODDS MYSELF THAN WERE PITTED AGAINST ME THAT DAY
WE WERE NOW IN A QUANDARY AS TO HOW TO PASS THE GUARDS WHO PATROLLED THE ISLAND ABOUT THE POOL AT LAST I HIT UPON A PLAN
THE GUARDS BELOW THERE THE GUARDS WE WERE CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND ALL SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN RUN QUICKLY ACROSS A LITTLE PIECE OF SWARD AND DISAPPEAR IN THE SHRUBBERY BEYOND HE WAS ON THE BALCONY WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM CRIED HOR VASTUS QUICK LET US FOLLOW HIM
WHAT I ASKED HE SMILED I SHALL WHISPER IT HERE BUT SOME DAY I SHALL STAND UPON THE DOME OF THE TEMPLE OF REWARD AND SHOUT IT TO CHEERING MULTITUDES BELOW WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED KANTOS KAN JOHN CARTER JEDDAK OF HELIUM
FOR A MOMENT TENSE SILENCE REIGNED IN THE NUPTIAL ROOM THEN THE FIFTY NOBLES RUSHED UPON ME FURIOUSLY WE FOUGHT BUT THE ADVANTAGE WAS MINE FOR I STOOD UPON A RAISED PLATFORM ABOVE THEM AND I FOUGHT FOR THE MOST GLORIOUS WOMAN OF A GLORIOUS RACE
THERE WERE PLENTY OF BLACKS ON OMEAN TO THWART US WERE WE APPREHENDED HOWEVER MANY MORE MIGHT COME FROM THE TEMPLES AND GARDENS OF ISSUS WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY DECREASE OUR CHANCES
EVEN THEN THERE WAS NO SCURRYING OF FEET AS WE HAD EXPECTED AND WHILE THE BOY REMAINED TO DIRECT THE BOAT I SLID FROM CABIN TO CABIN IN FUTILE SEARCH FOR SOME MEMBER OF THE CREW
THAT THEY CONSIDERED THE CAPTURE OF THE YOUNG WOMAN IMPORTANT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE LONG AND EARNEST INTERVIEW THE COMMANDER OF THE FLEET HELD WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM LATER SHE WAS BOUND AND PLACED IN THE COMPARTMENT WITH DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF THE NEW CAPTIVE WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL
I WAS CLOSE AT HIS HEELS SILENTLY WE DROPPED TO THE DESERTED DECK AND ON HANDS AND KNEES CRAWLED TOWARD THE HATCHWAY A STEALTHY GLANCE BELOW REVEALED NO GUARD IN SIGHT AND SO WITH THE QUICKNESS AND THE SOUNDLESSNESS
FESTERING IN ITS ROTTENNESS BY YOUR SIDE UNTIL CRAZED BY LONELINESS AND HUNGER YOU FEED UPON THE CRAWLING MAGGOTS THAT WERE ONCE A MAN THAT WAS ALL IN ANOTHER INSTANT SHE WAS GONE AND THE DIM LIGHT WHICH HAD FILLED THE CELL
THE RESULT OF WHICH IS SHOWN IN THE PRESENT SPLENDID RACE OF RED MEN I HAD ALWAYS SUPPOSED THAT ALL TRACES OF THE ORIGINAL RACES HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE FACE OF MARS YET WITHIN THE PAST FOUR DAYS I HAD FOUND BOTH WHITES AND BLACKS IN GREAT MULTITUDES
BLACKNESS PLEASANT OLD LADY SAID A VOICE AT MY SIDE WHO SPEAKS I ASKED TIS I YOUR COMPANION WHO HAS HAD THE HONOUR THIS DAY OF FIGHTING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE GREATEST WARRIOR THAT EVER WORE METAL UPON BARSOOM
SHE TOLD DEJAH THORIS THAT MANY YEARS AGO SHE HAD TAKEN THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE FROM THE COURT OF HER FATHER THE JEDDAK OF PTARTH SHE WAS THUVIA THE PRINCESS OF PTARTH AND THEN SHE ASKED DEJAH THORIS WHO SHE MIGHT BE
HERE WE DISCUSSED THE DETAILS OF OUR EXPEDITION UNTIL LONG AFTER DARK
I HAD HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK FORWARD TO SINCE I HAD RETURNED TO BARSOOM BUT EVEN NOW I WAS TO BE DISAPPOINTED HOW LONG I SLEPT I DO NOT KNOW WHEN I AWOKE SUDDENLY IT WAS TO FIND A HALF DOZEN POWERFUL MEN UPON ME A GAG ALREADY IN MY MOUTH
THAT EVENING ONE OF THE SMALLER CRUISERS THAT HAD BEEN FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE FLEET RETURNED WITH A PRISONER A YOUNG RED WOMAN WHOM THEY HAD PICKED UP IN A RANGE OF HILLS UNDER THE VERY NOSES THEY SAID OF A FLEET OF THREE RED MARTIAN BATTLESHIPS
THAT ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO INSPIRE ME TO VICTORY OVER EVEN GREATER ODDS AND I VERILY BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BESTED THE ENTIRE ROOMFUL OF YELLOW WARRIORS THAT DAY IN THE NUPTIAL CHAMBER OF THE PALACE AT KADABRA HAD NOT INTERRUPTION COME TO MY AID
KANTOS KAN HE WAS LEADING THE LITTLE PARTY THAT HAD WON ITS WAY INTO THE VERY HEART OF THE PALACE OF SALENSUS OLL IN AN INSTANT I SAW THAT BY ATTACKING THE OKARIANS FROM THE REAR I COULD SO QUICKLY DISORGANIZE THEM THAT THEIR FURTHER RESISTANCE WOULD BE SHORT LIVED
AND I WILL REPLACE THE TRAP THIS DONE HE TOOK ME BY THE HAND LEADING ME VERY SLOWLY WITH MUCH FEELING ABOUT AND FREQUENT HALTS TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT STRAY INTO WRONG PASSAGEWAYS
WERE IT NECESSARY IF IT THROWS ALL HELIUM INTO A BLOODY CONFLICT I SHALL GO ON WITH THESE PLANS TO SAVE MY PRINCESS NOTHING SHALL STAY ME NOW SHORT OF DEATH AND SHOULD I DIE MY FRIENDS
ON THE UNGUESSABLE ANTIQUITY OF THESE LONG FORGOTTEN CORRIDORS THE THINGS WHICH THE STYGIAN DARKNESS HID FROM MY OBJECTIVE EYE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HALF SO WONDERFUL AS THE PICTURES WHICH MY IMAGINATION WROUGHT AS IT CONJURED TO LIFE AGAIN THE ANCIENT PEOPLES
PRESENTLY WE COMMENCED THE DESCENT OF A VERY STEEP INCLINE IT WILL NOT BE LONG HE SAID BEFORE WE SHALL HAVE LIGHT AT THE LOWER LEVELS WE MEET THE SAME STRATUM OF PHOSPHORESCENT ROCK THAT ILLUMINATES OMEAN
AND THE CLANK OF METAL AND THE CLANG OF SWORDS WITHOUT ANOTHER GLANCE TOWARD ME WHO HAD STOOD A SPECTATOR OF THE TRAGIC SCENE THE NOBLES WHEELED AND FLED FROM THE APARTMENT THROUGH ANOTHER EXIT
I LAY ALL NIGHT WHERE I HAD FALLEN AND THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT AN EXPLANATION OF THE FORTUNATE COINCIDENCE THAT HAD SAVED ME FROM A TERRIBLE DEATH AS THE SUN ROSE I SAW A VAST PANORAMA OF SEA BOTTOM AND DISTANT HILLS LYING FAR BELOW ME
WE SEEM TO BE IN A PRETTY FIX HERE WITH A SPLENDID CHANCE OF DYING OF STARVATION AND THIRST WHERE ARE WE BENEATH THE ARENA I REPLIED WE TUMBLED DOWN THE SHAFT THAT SWALLOWED ISSUS AS SHE WAS ALMOST AT OUR MERCY
IF SUCH A THING WERE POSSIBLE
FOR THOUGH THE WOMEN OF MARS ARE NOT TRAINED IN THE ARTS OF WAR THE SPIRIT IS THEIRS AND THEY HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO DO THAT VERY THING UPON COUNTLESS OCCASIONS BUT SHE DID NOT COME AND GLAD I WAS
AND THE DETAILS OF THE ENTIRE PLAN HAD BEEN MAPPED OUT
WHEN WE OVERTOOK HER SHE FEIGNED ANGER AND ORDERED US BACK TO THE PALACE BUT FOR ONCE WE DISOBEYED HER AND WHEN SHE FOUND THAT WE WOULD NOT LET HER GO UPON THE LAST LONG PILGRIMAGE ALONE SHE WEPT AND EMBRACED US AND TOGETHER WE WENT OUT INTO THE NIGHT TOWARD THE SOUTH
AND I KNEW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD BATTLED HIS WAY FROM A HUNDRED MORE DANGEROUS TRAPS THAN THAT IN WHICH HE NOW WAS SO IT WAS WITH NO FEELINGS OF DESPAIR THAT I TURNED MY ATTENTION TO THE BUSINESS OF THE MOMENT CONSTANTLY MY THOUGHTS REVERTED TO DEJAH THORIS
BUT OF A SUDDEN THE OLD FIRE OF UNCONQUERABLE SELF CONFIDENCE SURGED THROUGH ME I SPRANG TO MY FEET AND WITH BACK THROWN SHOULDERS AND UPRAISED SWORD TOOK A SOLEMN VOW TO REACH RESCUE AND REVENGE MY PRINCESS A HUNDRED SWORDS LEAPED FROM A HUNDRED SCABBARDS
WHEN THE FEET TREAD EMPTY AIR AND THE DISTANCE BELOW IS SHROUDED IN DARKNESS THERE IS A FEELING AKIN TO PANIC AT THE THOUGHT OF RELEASING THE HOLD AND TAKING THE PLUNGE INTO UNKNOWN DEPTHS ALTHOUGH THE BOY HAD TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BUT TEN FEET TO THE FLOOR BELOW
WILL YOU TAKE OATH TO PROSECUTE THE SEARCH FOR HER AND BRING HER BACK IN SAFETY TO HER GRANDFATHER'S COURT UPON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD EACH OF THEM SWORE TO DO AS I HAD ASKED IT WAS AGREED THAT THE BATTLESHIPS THAT WERE TO BE REMODELLED SHOULD BE ORDERED TO HASTOR
FOR MANY YEARS THE BLACK HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE REFITTING OF CAPTURED BATTLESHIPS THAT THEY MIGHT NAVIGATE OMEAN AND SO WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROPELLERS HOUSINGS AND THE AUXILIARY GEARING REQUIRED
A WAY INTO THE ALMOST IMPREGNABLE PALACE OF THE TYRANT OF THE NORTH AS I CROSSED THE CHAMBER TO ATTACK THE KADABRANS FROM THE REAR A SMALL DOORWAY AT MY LEFT OPENED AND TO MY SURPRISE REVEALED THE FIGURES OF MATAI SHANG
IT WOULD BE WEARISOME TO NARRATE THE DETAILS OF THAT BLOODY STRUGGLE OF HOW WE FOUGHT FROM THE DOORWAY THE FULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM TO THE VERY FOOT OF THE THRONE BEFORE THE LAST OF MY ANTAGONISTS FELL WITH MY BLADE PIERCING HIS HEART AND THEN WITH A GLAD CRY
IT WAS NO TRIFLING JOB THAT HOR VASTUS HAD BEFORE HIM AFTER THEY HAD LEFT I BID CARTHORIS GOOD NIGHT FOR I WAS VERY TIRED AND GOING TO MY OWN APARTMENTS BATHED AND LAY DOWN UPON MY SLEEPING SILKS AND FURS FOR THE FIRST GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
FROM THE CORRIDOR UNDETECTED PRESENTLY I SAW A SERIES OF DOORS OPENING FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE CORRIDOR AND AS THEY ALL LOOKED ALIKE TO ME I TRIED THE FIRST ONE THAT I REACHED IT OPENED INTO A SMALL CHAMBER LUXURIOUSLY FURNISHED
I COULD NOT FOLLOW ANOTHER LEADER WHO INSPIRED GREATER CONFIDENCE THAN YOU COME LET US PUT YOUR RUSE TO THE TEST BOLDLY WE EMERGED FROM THE HATCHWAY OF THE CRAFT LEAVING OUR SWORDS BEHIND US AND STRODE TO THE MAIN EXIT WHICH LED TO THE SENTRY'S POST
THE MESSENGER STAGGERED BACK IN HORROR AS THOUGH FROM A BLOW IN THE FACE THEN FLY NOBLES OF OKAR HE CRIED FOR NAUGHT CAN SAVE YOU HARK THEY COME AS HE SPOKE WE HEARD THE DEEP ROAR OF ANGRY MEN FROM THE CORRIDOR WITHOUT
AND I FOUGHT FOR A GREAT LOVE AND FOR THE MOTHER OF MY BOY AND FROM BEHIND MY SHOULDER IN THE SILVERY CADENCE OF THAT DEAR VOICE ROSE THE BRAVE BATTLE ANTHEM OF HELIUM WHICH THE NATION'S WOMEN SING AS THEIR MEN MARCH OUT TO VICTORY
ONLY OUR FIRST ANCESTOR KNOWS HE REPLIED WE REACHED THE SUBMARINE POOL IN OMEAN WITHOUT INCIDENT HERE WE DEBATED THE WISDOM OF SINKING THE CRAFT BEFORE LEAVING HER BUT FINALLY DECIDED THAT IT WOULD ADD NOTHING TO OUR CHANCES FOR ESCAPE
TARS TARKAS WAS TO GET INTO COMMUNICATION WITH THARK AND LEARN THE SENTIMENTS OF HIS PEOPLE TOWARD HIS RETURN FROM DOR IF FAVOURABLE HE WAS TO REPAIR IMMEDIATELY TO THARK AND DEVOTE HIS TIME TO THE ASSEMBLING OF A GREAT HORDE OF GREEN WARRIORS
AND I THINK ONCE OUT THAT WE SHALL FIND NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ARMING OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN A COUNTRY WHICH ABOUNDS SO PLENTIFULLY IN ARMED MEN AS YOU SAY HE REPLIED WITH A SMILE AND SHRUG
IMMEDIATELY TWO GUARDSMEN APPEARED DRAGGING THE UNWILLING BRIDE TOWARD THE ALTAR HER HANDS WERE STILL MANACLED BEHIND HER EVIDENTLY TO PREVENT SUICIDE HER DISHEVELED HAIR AND PANTING BOSOM BETOKENED THAT
WHAT I WAS MOST CONCERNED IN OF COURSE WAS THE RESCUING OF DEJAH THORIS
I HOPE HE HEARD ONLY OUR REFERENCES TO A NEW JEDDAK I SAID IF HE OVERHEARD OUR PLANS TO RESCUE DEJAH THORIS IT WILL MEAN CIVIL WAR FOR HE WILL ATTEMPT TO THWART US AND IN THAT I WILL NOT BE THWARTED THERE WOULD I TURN AGAINST TARDOS MORS HIMSELF
HOPE HE WON'T THEM CELLARS ARE TOO VALLYBLE HALLO WHAT NOW
I HAVE PICKED A FEW SAID THE TALL THIN GENTLEMAN COLOURING SLIGHTLY I BEG YOUR PARDON MASTER SHACKLE FOR DOING SO I OUGHT TO HAVE ASKED YOUR LEAVE
IT WAS ABOUT THAT MAN SAID THE OTHER DON'T SHY AT IT LIKE A HORSE AT A BLUE BOGEY IN A WINDY LANE BUT I TOLD YOU MAN LAST TIME THAT I WOULD HAVE NO MORE TO DO WITH THAT WRETCHED SMUGGLING DON'T CALL THINGS BY UGLY NAMES
WAS HURLING THE CHARGE OF DOCTRINAIRISM AGAINST THE CRAFTY CAPITALIST POLITICIANS WHO SEIZED UPON THE FIRST SUITABLE EXCUSE FOR COMPELLING THEIR POLITICAL CLERKS TO REPENT OF THE DECISIVE TURN THEY HAD GIVEN
AND THEN A STRANGE THING OCCURRED IT IS NO USE SAID A VOICE THE HOUSE IS DESERTED NO ONE HAS BEEN HERE THESE TEN DAYS DO NOT STAY HERE TO TORMENT YOURSELF NO ONE ESCAPED BUT YOU
AY TO BE SURE SAID SHACKLE
BUT BY POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE NINETEENTH OF JUNE THERE WAS A SO CALLED PATRIOTIC DEMONSTRATION IN THE STREETS OF PETROGRAD THE NEVSKY PROSPECT
FOR A TIME I STOOD REGARDING THESE VESTIGES THEN I RETURNED THROUGH THE PINE WOOD NECK HIGH WITH RED WEED HERE AND THERE TO FIND THE LANDLORD OF THE SPOTTED DOG HAD ALREADY FOUND BURIAL AND SO CAME HOME PAST THE COLLEGE ARMS
TO DRIVE THE BOURGEOISIE OUT OF POWER AND PROMOTE THE AIMS OF THE REVOLUTION OR TO ADOPT THE POLICY OF BRIDLING THE PEOPLE BY RESORTING TO REPRESSIVE MEASURES
AND I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO REPAY YOU TCHAH WHO WANTS REPAYING SIR RISDON WE HAVE PLENTY AT THE FARM
I DON BELIEVE SHE'D LIKE HER FATHER TO MISS GETTING A LOT OF THINGS THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR HIM AND YOUR MADAM THERE SIR RISDON DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT
THAT THOSE CONCESSIONS WHICH HE AND TERESHCHENKO HAD MADE TO THE KIEV RADA DID NOT BY ANY MEANS SIGNIFY A DISMEMBERMENT OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT THIS THEREFORE DID NOT GIVE THE CADETS ANY GOOD REASON FOR LEAVING THE MINISTRY
I LEARNED NOTHING FRESH EXCEPT THAT ALREADY IN ONE WEEK THE EXAMINATION OF THE MARTIAN MECHANISMS HAD YIELDED ASTONISHING RESULTS AMONG OTHER THINGS THE ARTICLE ASSURED ME WHAT I DID NOT BELIEVE AT THE TIME THAT THE SECRET OF FLYING WAS DISCOVERED
THE RATS TELL EM TO TAKE NO NOTICE SIR RISDON GOOD DAY SIR RISDON THAT'S SETTLED THEN
I YES MASTER SHACKLE SEE THE CUTTER I THINK I SAW A SMALL VESSEL LYING SOME DISTANCE OFF WITH WHITE SAILS THAT'S THE WHITE HAWK LUFF BROUGH
BUT SUFFICIENTLY AWAKE TO WHAT WAS AROUND TO MAKE HIM STOOP FROM TIME TO TIME TO PICK UP A GLISTENING WHITE TOPPED MUSHROOM
THE FOOD AND TRANSPORTATION SITUATIONS WERE BECOMING MORE AND MORE DISORGANIZED LOCAL CLASHES WERE GROWING MORE FREQUENT THE SOCIALISTIC MINISTERS WERE EXHORTING THE MASSES TO BE PATIENT ALL DECISIONS AND MEASURES
I REMEMBER HOW MOCKINGLY BRIGHT THE DAY SEEMED AS I WENT BACK ON MY MELANCHOLY PILGRIMAGE TO THE LITTLE HOUSE AT WOKING HOW BUSY THE STREETS AND VIVID THE MOVING LIFE ABOUT ME SO MANY PEOPLE WERE ABROAD EVERYWHERE BUSIED IN A THOUSAND ACTIVITIES
BUT THE SOLITARY COMPOSITOR WHO DID THE THING HAD AMUSED HIMSELF BY MAKING A GROTESQUE SCHEME OF ADVERTISEMENT STEREO ON THE BACK PAGE THE MATTER HE PRINTED WAS EMOTIONAL THE NEWS ORGANISATION HAD NOT AS YET FOUND ITS WAY BACK
AND HAD TO BE CHECKED NOT THE KING'S LAWS BUT THE LAWS OF THAT DUTCHMAN WHO HAS COME AND STUCK HIMSELF ON THE THRONE
IN A BROAD SKIRTED SHABBY BROWN VELVET COAT WHO WAS DAINTILY PICKING HIS WAY CANE IN HAND OVER THE SOFT TURF OF THE FIELD
IT SLAMMED AGAIN THE CURTAINS OF MY STUDY FLUTTERED OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW FROM WHICH I AND THE ARTILLERYMAN HAD WATCHED THE DAWN NO ONE HAD CLOSED IT SINCE THE SMASHED BUSHES WERE JUST AS I HAD LEFT THEM NEARLY FOUR WEEKS AGO
AND AN OPEN OFFER OF PEACE KERENSKY FLUNG THE REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS INTO BATTLE THIS WAS NO MERE COINCIDENCE TO BE SURE THE PROJECTORS HAD EVERYTHING PREPARED IN ADVANCE AND THE TIME OF ATTACK WAS DETERMINED NOT BY MILITARY
I I CANNOT MASTER SHACKLE IT IS AGAINST THE LAW
THE LADS COULD RUN IT UP THE VALLEY AND DOWN INTO YOUR CELLAR SIR RISDON WHISPERED THE MAN AS IF AFRAID THAT THE OLD GREY HORSE WOULD HEAR NOBODY WOULD BE A BIT THE WISER AND YOU'D BE DOING A NEIGHBOUR A GOOD TURN
ALL THAT TIME I FELT A VAGUE A GROWING CRAVING TO LOOK ONCE MORE ON WHATEVER REMAINED OF THE LITTLE LIFE THAT SEEMED SO HAPPY AND BRIGHT IN MY PAST IT WAS A MERE HOPELESS DESIRE TO FEAST UPON MY MISERY THEY DISSUADED ME
AND SAT WITH FOLDED ARMS LOOKING GREYLY AT THE SUNLIT DEVASTATION THAT FLOWED PAST THE WINDOWS AND JUST OUTSIDE THE TERMINUS THE TRAIN JOLTED OVER TEMPORARY RAILS AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RAILWAY THE HOUSES WERE BLACKENED RUINS
YOU WILL SIR RISDON NO NO I DARE NOT AND IT GIVES A NEIGHBOUR A CHANCE TO BEG YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF A LITTLE DROP O REAL COGNAC SIR RISDON SO GOOD IN CASE O SICKNESS
AS I WAS OUT IN MY LITTLE LUGGER AND WE'D TOOK A LOT O MACKREL RAM I SAYS TO MY BOY RAMILLIES THINK SIR RISDON WOULD MIND IF I SENT HIM A FEW FISH UP TO THE HOZE
AND THAT EVERY OTHER MAN STILL WORE HIS DIRTY RAGS THEIR FACES SEEMED ALL WITH ONE OF TWO EXPRESSIONS A LEAPING EXULTATION AND ENERGY OR A GRIM RESOLUTION SAVE FOR THE EXPRESSION OF THE FACES
DOCTRINAIRISM OF FAILING TO UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY FOR COMPROMISING WITH THE UKRAINIANS ET CETERA ET CETERA THE TOTAL IMPRESSION WAS PITIFUL IN THE EXTREME THE HOPELESS DOCTRINAIRE OF THE COALITION GOVERNMENT
AFTER ALL THE PRECEDING EXPERIENCE OF THE COALITION THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE BUT ONE WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY TO BREAK WITH THE CADETS AND SET UP A SOVIET GOVERNMENT THE RELATIVE FORCES WITHIN THE SOVIETS
AND ON BY THE SPOT WHERE THE MARTIAN HAD APPEARED TO ME IN THE THUNDERSTORM HERE MOVED BY CURIOSITY I TURNED ASIDE TO FIND AMONG A TANGLE OF RED FRONDS THE WARPED AND BROKEN DOG CART
THE SENTENCE ENDED ABRUPTLY I REMEMBERED MY INABILITY TO FIX MY MIND THAT MORNING SCARCELY A MONTH GONE BY AND HOW I HAD BROKEN OFF TO GET MY DAILY CHRONICLE FROM THE NEWSBOY I REMEMBERED HOW I WENT DOWN TO THE GARDEN GATE AS HE CAME ALONG
THEY DID ALL THEY COULD TO DIVERT ME FROM THIS MORBIDITY BUT AT LAST I COULD RESIST THE IMPULSE NO LONGER AND PROMISING FAITHFULLY TO RETURN TO THEM AND PARTING AS I WILL CONFESS FROM THESE FOUR DAY FRIENDS WITH TEARS
TRANSFIXED BY A STICK THAT KEPT IT IN PLACE IT WAS THE PLACARD OF THE FIRST NEWSPAPER TO RESUME PUBLICATION THE DAILY MAIL I BOUGHT A COPY FOR A BLACKENED SHILLING I FOUND IN MY POCKET
IN VIEW OF ITS GREAT HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE WE APPEND AN EXTRACT FROM THE DOCUMENT ISSUED BY OUR PARTY IN THE ALL RUSSIAN COUNCIL OF SOVIETS ON THE THIRD OF JUNE NINETEEN SEVENTEEN JUST TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE DRIVE
TO CLAPHAM JUNCTION THE FACE OF LONDON WAS GRIMY WITH POWDER OF THE BLACK SMOKE IN SPITE OF TWO DAYS OF THUNDERSTORMS AND RAIN AND AT CLAPHAM JUNCTION THE LINE HAD BEEN WRECKED AGAIN THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF OUT OF WORK CLERKS AND SHOPMEN
THERE'S A THREE MASTED LUGGER COMING OVER FROM USHANT AND SHE MAY BE IN TO NIGHT THERE'S SOME NICE THICK FOGS ABOUT NOW AND IT'S A QUIET SEA YOUR CELLARS ARE QUITE EMPTY I S'POSE
WHO HAD TAKEN TO FISHING OR LIKE A FISHERMAN WHO HAD TAKEN TO FARMING AND HIS NAUTICAL APPEARANCE SEEMED STRANGE TO A MAN WHO WAS LEADING A VERY MEDITATIVE GREY HORSE ATTACHED TO A HEAVY CART
WHY SIR YOU OUGHT TO TAKE A PLEASURE IN BREAKING HIS LAWS AFTER THE WAY HE HAS ROBBED YOU AND TURNED YOU FROM A REAL GENTLEMAN INTO A POOR HARD PRESSED COUNTRY SQUIRE WHO HUSH HUSH MASTER SHACKLE SAID THE TALL GENTLEMAN HUSKILY
I WENT OUT AGAIN INTO THE STREETS THAT HAD LATELY BEEN SO DARK AND STRANGE AND EMPTY ALREADY THEY WERE BUSY WITH RETURNING PEOPLE IN PLACES EVEN THERE WERE SHOPS OPEN AND I SAW A DRINKING FOUNTAIN RUNNING WATER
WHICH SEEMED TO US ALMOST INEVITABLE A SUCCESSFUL MILITARY ADVANCE WOULD HAVE UNITED THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THE BOURGEOISIE IN THEIR COMMON CHAUVINISTIC TENDENCIES THUS ISOLATING THE REVOLUTIONARY PROLETARIAT
APPARENTLY THEY HAD LEARNED SOMETHING OF MY STORY FROM ME DURING THE DAYS OF MY LAPSE VERY GENTLY WHEN MY MIND WAS ASSURED AGAIN DID THEY BREAK TO ME WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED OF THE FATE OF LEATHERHEAD
WHILE MASTER SHACKLE WENT ON CHUCKLING TO HIMSELF COULDN'T SAY ME NAY POOR FELLOW HALF STARVED THEY ARE SOMETIMES
I STUMBLED INTO THE HALL AND THE HOUSE FELT EMPTY THE STAIR CARPET WAS RUFFLED AND DISCOLOURED WHERE I HAD CROUCHED SOAKED TO THE SKIN FROM THE THUNDERSTORM THE NIGHT OF THE CATASTROPHE
AND VERY PAINFUL TO THE EYE
CHAPTER THREE HOW DO SIR RISDON THE SPEAKER WAS A CURIOUS LOOKING MAN OF FIFTY ROUGH SUNBURNED AND EVIDENTLY AS KEEN AS A WELL WORN KNIFE HE WAS DRESSED LIKE A FARMER
THEY HAVE TOLD ME SINCE THAT I WAS SINGING SOME INSANE DOGGEREL ABOUT THE LAST MAN LEFT ALIVE HURRAH THE LAST MAN LEFT ALIVE
WANT TO GROW INTO A JEMMY DADD NO FATHER THEN BE OFF
TWO DAYS AFTER I WAS IMPRISONED IT HAD BEEN DESTROYED WITH EVERY SOUL IN IT BY A MARTIAN HE HAD SWEPT IT OUT OF EXISTENCE AS IT SEEMED WITHOUT ANY PROVOCATION AS A BOY MIGHT CRUSH AN ANT HILL
AND A LENGTH OR TWO OF FRENCH SILK MASTER SHACKLE MASTER SHACKLE CRIED THE TALL THIN BARONET PITEOUSLY HOW CAN YOU TEMPT A POOR SUFFERING GENTLEMAN LIKE THIS
INCLUDING THE CALLING OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WERE BEING POSTPONED THE INSOLVENCY AND THE INSTABILITY OF THE COALITION REGIME WERE OBVIOUS THERE WERE TWO POSSIBLE WAYS OUT
THE NEWS OF VICTORY DID NOT LAST LONG IT WAS SOON REPLACED BY GLOOMY REPORTS OF THE REFUSAL OF MANY REGIMENTS TO SUPPORT THE ADVANCING COLUMNS OF THE GREAT LOSSES IN COMMANDING OFFICERS WHO SOMETIMES COMPOSED THE WHOLE OF THE ATTACKING UNITS ET CETERA
IN THE MERE WANTONNESS OF POWER I WAS A LONELY MAN AND THEY WERE VERY KIND TO ME I WAS A LONELY MAN AND A SAD ONE AND THEY BORE WITH ME I REMAINED WITH THEM FOUR DAYS AFTER MY RECOVERY
CONSIDERED THAT THE PRINCIPAL AIM HAD BEEN ATTAINED
YOU SEE THE REVENUE CUTTER'S HANGING ABOUT HERE A DEAL AND IT LOOKS BAD SURELY NO ONE WOULD BETRAY YOU MASTER SHACKLE HOPE NOT SIR RISDON
AND PRECIOUS GLAD TO GET THEM
THE LAST REMARK CAME SO QUICKLY THAT THE HEARER STARTED AND MADE NO REPLY YOU SEE SIR RISDON WE MIGHT RUN THE CARGO AND STOW IT ALL UP AT MY PLACE FOR WE'VE PLENTY O ROOM
UNDERSTOOD THAT THE UNSUCCESSFUL MILITARY ADVANCE OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH MIGHT DEAL A BLOW NOT ONLY TO THE REVOLUTION BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT TEMPORARILY THEY THREW THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF RESPONSIBILITY UPON THEIR ALLIES TO THE LEFT
CLUNG TO A MIDDLE COURSE AND ONLY MUDDLED MATTERS THE MORE
THIS ONCE ONLY MASTER SHACKLE THANK YE SIR RISDON SAID THE MAN JEE DUTCHMAN THE HORSE TUGGED AT THE TUMBRIL AND SIR RISDON WENT THOUGHTFULLY ALONG THE FIELD TOWARD A CLUMP OF TREES LYING IN A HOLLOW
AND I WANTED TO SPEAK TO YOU SIR RISDON THE GENTLEMAN STARTED NOT ABOUT
THOUGH ITS ONLY PRETENSIONS TO BEING A ROAD WAS THAT IT LED FROM SHACKLE'S FARM TO THE FIELDS WHICH BORDERED THE CLIFF AND CONSISTED OF TWO DEEP CHANNELS MADE BY THE FARM TUMBRIL WHEELS
IT'S A PITY TOO THE LATTER CONTINUED SPECIALLY AS WE OFTEN HAVE SO MUCH FISH WE PUTS IT ON THE LAND
LONDON SEEMED A CITY OF TRAMPS THE VESTRIES WERE INDISCRIMINATELY DISTRIBUTING BREAD SENT US BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT THE RIBS OF THE FEW HORSES SHOWED DISMALLY HAGGARD SPECIAL CONSTABLES WITH WHITE BADGES STOOD AT THE CORNERS OF EVERY STREET
AH MASTER SHACKLE HE SAID STARTING SLIGHTLY ON BEING ADDRESSED WELL THANK YOU A LOVELY MORNING INDEED
A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE DRIVE WE DECLARED THAT THE MILITARY ADVANCE WOULD INEVITABLY DESTROY ALL THE INTERNAL TIES WITHIN THE ARMY SET UP ITS VARIOUS PARTS ONE AGAINST THE OTHER AND TURN THE SCALES HEAVILY IN FAVOR OF THE COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY ELEMENTS
FOR A SPACE I STOOD READING OVER MY ABANDONED ARGUMENTS IT WAS A PAPER ON THE PROBABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MORAL IDEAS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CIVILISING PROCESS AND THE LAST SENTENCE WAS THE OPENING OF A PROPHECY
INDICATED TO THE BOURGEOISIE A DIFFERENT LINE OF FUTURE EVENTS
HAVING BROKEN WITH THE BOURGEOISIE THE MIDDLE CLASS DEMOCRACY WOULD ITSELF FALL UNDER THEIR BAN AND WOULD BE COMPELLED TO SEEK A CLOSER UNION WITH THE SOCIALISTIC PROLETARIAT IN THIS WAY
AT WATERLOO I FOUND THE FREE TRAINS THAT WERE TAKING PEOPLE TO THEIR HOMES THE FIRST RUSH WAS ALREADY OVER THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE IN THE TRAIN AND I WAS IN NO MOOD FOR CASUAL CONVERSATION I GOT A COMPARTMENT TO MYSELF
A MAN STANDING AT AN OPEN COTTAGE DOOR GREETED ME BY NAME AS I PASSED I LOOKED AT MY HOUSE WITH A QUICK FLASH OF HOPE THAT FADED IMMEDIATELY THE DOOR HAD BEEN FORCED IT WAS UNFAST AND WAS OPENING SLOWLY AS I APPROACHED
WERE SUCH AT THE TIME THAT THE SOVIET'S POWER AS A POLITICAL PARTY WOULD FALL NATURALLY INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOCIAL REVOLUTIONISTS AND THE MENSHEVIKI WE DELIBERATELY FACED THE SITUATION THANKS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF REELECTIONS AT ANY TIME
ALL THAT I DID THAT DAY UNTIL THE TIME THAT I STOOD WEEPING AND PRAISING GOD UPON THE SUMMIT OF PRIMROSE HILL AND THEN I FORGET OF THE NEXT THREE DAYS I KNOW NOTHING I HAVE LEARNED SINCE THAT SO FAR FROM MY BEING THE FIRST DISCOVERER OF THE MARTIAN OVERTHROW
BUT OF ALL THIS I HAVE NO MEMORY I DRIFTED A DEMENTED MAN I FOUND MYSELF IN A HOUSE OF KINDLY PEOPLE WHO HAD FOUND ME ON THE THIRD DAY WANDERING WEEPING AND RAVING THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAINT JOHN'S WOOD
REGARDLESS OF ITS ULTIMATE MILITARY RESULTS WOULD DEAL A MORTAL BLOW TO THE REVOLUTION RESTORE THE ARMY'S FORMER DISCIPLINE AND ASSURE THE LIBERAL BOURGEOISIE OF A COMMANDING POSITION IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT WE HOWEVER
AMAZED AND AFRAID EVEN AS I STOOD AMAZED AND AFRAID WERE MY COUSIN AND MY WIFE MY WIFE WHITE AND TEARLESS SHE GAVE A FAINT CRY I CAME SHE SAID
SINCE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE IN A DEMORALIZED ARMY AN ARMY DEVOID OF CONTROLLING IDEAS WITHOUT RECOURSE TO SEVERE REPRESSIVE MEASURES IN OTHER WORDS WE FORETOLD IN THIS DECLARATION
SHOUTING TO GAUNT STARING FIGURES OF DESPAIR AND FOR THE FOOD ACROSS THE CHANNEL ACROSS THE IRISH SEA ACROSS THE ATLANTIC CORN BREAD AND MEAT WERE TEARING TO OUR RELIEF ALL THE SHIPPING IN THE WORLD SEEMED GOING LONDONWARD IN THOSE DAYS
RECEIVE A GREATER FOLLOWING IN THE SOVIET ORGANIZATIONS UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE PROLETARIAT'S STRUGGLE FOR POWER WOULD NATURALLY MOVE IN THE CHANNEL OF SOVIET ORGANIZATIONS AND COULD TAKE A MORE NORMAL COURSE
OUR MUDDY FOOTSTEPS I SAW STILL WENT UP THE STAIRS I FOLLOWED THEM TO MY STUDY AND FOUND LYING ON MY WRITING TABLE STILL WITH THE SELENITE PAPER WEIGHT UPON IT THE SHEET OF WORK I HAD LEFT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE OPENING OF THE CYLINDER
I WAS STARTLED HAD I SPOKEN MY THOUGHT ALOUD I TURNED AND THE FRENCH WINDOW WAS OPEN BEHIND ME I MADE A STEP TO IT AND STOOD LOOKING OUT AND THERE
NEVER FEEL SHAMED TO LOOK MY BOY RAMILLIES IN THE FACE IF A BIT O SMUGGLING WAS WRONG SIR RISDON THINK I'D DO IT NO SIR I THINK O THEM AS WAS BEFORE ME MY FATHER WAS IN MARLBOROUGH'S WARS
AND A BIT OF PRIME TAY SUCH AS WOULD PLEASE HER LADYSHIP THEN THINK HOW PLEASANT A PIPE IS SIR RISDON
MADE MORE WEIGHTY BY THE GREATCOAT OF CAKED MUD THE VEHICLE WORE
DAN ALREADY ENTERTAINED HOPES OF A RADICAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO BE HASTILY BUILT UP AT THE TIME BY A FEW PRO DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS THE REPORT THAT THE COALITION GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN BROKEN UP
THOSE RESULTS WHICH LATER CAME TO BE KNOWN COLLECTIVELY UNDER THE NAME OF KORNILOVISM WE BELIEVED THAT THE GREATEST DANGER THREATENED THE REVOLUTION IN EITHER CASE WHETHER THE DRIVE PROVED SUCCESSFUL WHICH WE DID NOT EXPECT OR MET WITH FAILURE
THE NURSERY GROUNDS WERE EVERYWHERE CRIMSON WITH THE WEED
SUCH DEMANDS FREQUENTLY CAME FROM THE SO CALLED SOCIALISTIC PAPERS ALSO KERENSKY MORE AND MORE OPENLY WENT OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE CADETS AND THE CADET GENERALS WHO HAD MANIFESTED NOT ONLY THEIR HATRED OF REVOLUTION
I SAW LITTLE OF THE MISCHIEF WROUGHT BY THE MARTIANS UNTIL I REACHED WELLINGTON STREET AND THERE I SAW THE RED WEED CLAMBERING OVER THE BUTTRESSES OF WATERLOO BRIDGE AT THE CORNER OF THE BRIDGE TOO I SAW ONE OF THE COMMON CONTRASTS OF THAT GROTESQUE TIME
BUT ALSO THEIR BITTER ENMITY TOWARD REVOLUTIONARY PARTIES IN GENERAL THE ALLIED AMBASSADORS WERE PRESSING THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE DEMAND THAT ARMY DISCIPLINE BE RESTORED AND THE ADVANCE CONTINUED THE GREATEST PANIC PREVAILED IN GOVERNMENT CIRCLES
THE MILITARY EVENTS WERE DEVELOPING AMID EVER INCREASING DIFFICULTIES IN THE INTERNAL LIFE OF THE NATION WITH REGARD TO THE LAND QUESTION INDUSTRIAL LIFE AND NATIONAL RELATIONS THE COALITION GOVERNMENT DID NOT TAKE A SINGLE RESOLUTE STEP FORWARD
AN UNSUCCESSFUL DRIVE WAS LIKELY TO DEMORALIZE THE ARMY COMPLETELY TO INVOLVE A GENERAL RETREAT AND THE LOSS OF MUCH ADDITIONAL TERRITORY AND TO BRING DISGUST AND DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE PEOPLE EVENTS TOOK THE LATTER COURSE
WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE CUSTOMARY NAVVIES AND WE WERE JOLTED OVER A HASTY RELAYING ALL DOWN THE LINE FROM THERE THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY WAS GAUNT AND UNFAMILIAR WIMBLEDON PARTICULARLY HAD SUFFERED
TO THE BLUE GREEN SOFTNESS OF THE EASTWARD HILLS THE LINE ON THE LONDON SIDE OF WOKING STATION WAS STILL UNDERGOING REPAIR SO I DESCENDED AT BYFLEET STATION AND TOOK THE ROAD TO MAYBURY
AND A SHALLOW TRACK FORMED BY HORSES HOOFS THE SAID CHANNELS BEING MORE OFTEN FULL OF WATER THAN OF MUD AND BOASTING THE QUALITY OF NEVER EVEN IN THE HOTTEST WEATHER BEING DRY
WERE THE HEAPED MASSES OF EARTH ABOUT THE SIXTH CYLINDER A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE STANDING ABOUT IT AND SOME SAPPERS WERE BUSY IN THE MIDST OF IT
AND LET ME HAVE YOUR BILL BY AND BY I SHOULD BE GRATIFIED ON'Y TOO GLAD SIR RISDON I WILL THINK ANY ONE'S BEEN TELLING TALES TALES BOUT US SIR RISDON
THE PERSON BLENHEIM SHACKLE FARMER AND FISHER IN HIS CANVAS SAILOR'S BREECHES BIG BOOTS STRIPED SHIRT AND RED TASSEL CAP HAD ACCOSTED WAS A TALL THIN ARISTOCRATIC LOOKING GENTLEMAN
AH MASTER SHACKLE I'M LOSING HEART NAY DON'T DO THAT SIR RISDON AND AS TO A FEW MUSHROOMS WHY YOU'RE WELCOME ENOUGH AND I'D OFTEN BE SENDING A CHICKEN OR A FEW EGGS OR A KIT O BUTTER
THESE PEOPLE WHOSE NAME MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THEM I MAY NOT EVEN GIVE HERE NEVERTHELESS CUMBERED THEMSELVES WITH ME SHELTERED ME AND PROTECTED ME FROM MYSELF
WITH ALL ITS CONSEQUENCES THE COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY CIRCLES OF RUSSIA ARE COUNTING ON THE FACT THAT THIS DRIVE WILL NECESSITATE A CONCENTRATION OF POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE MILITARY DIPLOMATIC AND CAPITALISTIC GROUPS
THENCE THE JOYFUL NEWS HAD FLASHED ALL OVER THE WORLD A THOUSAND CITIES CHILLED BY GHASTLY APPREHENSIONS SUDDENLY FLASHED INTO FRANTIC ILLUMINATIONS THEY KNEW OF IT IN DUBLIN EDINBURGH MANCHESTER BIRMINGHAM
AND TAKE TWO ROLLS OF BUTTER A BIT OF HONEY AND A COUPLE OF CHICKENS UP TO THE HOZE YES FATHER
BUT IF THEY GOT AN IDEA OF IT ABOARD THE CUTTER SHE'D LAND SOME MEN SOMEHOW AND COME AND SEARCH ME BUT THEY WOULDN'T DARE TO COME AND SEARCH YOU I'VE GOT A BAD CHARACTER BUT YOU HAVEN'T
THE SOVIET MINISTERS CAME TO REPORT A NEW CRISIS IN THE GOVERNMENT WE WERE INTENSELY INTERESTED TO LEARN WHAT POSITION THEY WOULD TAKE NOW THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY GONE TO PIECES UNDER THE GREAT ORDEALS ARISING FROM COALITION POLICIES
THERE WERE STILL MANY BOURGEOIS ELEMENTS WHICH COULD STILL GO HAND IN HAND WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATS AND THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE OF THEIR CO OPERATION IT WAS NECESSARY TO ATTRACT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BOURGEOISIE INTO THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE NEW MINISTRY
ON THE SECOND OF JULY CAME A CRISIS IN THE MINISTRY THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF WHICH WAS THE UKRAINIAN QUESTION
THEY DON'T WANT US TO SEND THEM FISH MY LADY'S TOO PROUD
AFFILIATED WITH ENGLISH FRENCH AND AMERICAN IMPERIALISM AND THUS FREE THEM FROM THE NECESSITY OF RECKONING LATER WITH THE ORGANIZED WILL OF RUSSIAN DEMOCRACY THE SECRET COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY INSTIGATORS OF THE DRIVE
DON'T RAKE UP MY MISFORTUNES NOT I SIR RISDON I'M FULL O SORROW AND RESPECT FOR A NOBLE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS SUFFERED FOR THE CAUSE OF THE REAL KING WHO WHEN HE COMES WILL SET US ALL RIGHT
YES FATHER BUT WELL THINK THE LUGGER WILL COME TO NIGHT NO I DON'T THINK ANYTHING AND DON'T YOU WILL YOU KEEP THAT RATTLE TONGUE OF YOURS QUIET
THERE WERE THE MUTTON AND THE BREAD BOTH FAR GONE NOW IN DECAY AND A BEER BOTTLE OVERTURNED JUST AS I AND THE ARTILLERYMAN HAD LEFT THEM MY HOME WAS DESOLATE I PERCEIVED THE FOLLY OF THE FAINT HOPE I HAD CHERISHED SO LONG
ONLY TO BE REPLACED BY A NEW COALITION SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH PETROGRAD AND PROVOKED A STORM OF INDIGNATION AMONG THE WORKINGMEN AND SOLDIERS EVERYWHERE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE CONTINUED THE TALL THIN GENTLEMAN RAISING THE FLAP OF ONE OF HIS SALT BOX POCKETS I DON'T WANT TO SEE GROWLED THE OTHER AS HE STOOD PATTING THE NECK OF HIS OLD GREY HORSE BEEN TO THE CLIFF EDGE
ARE CONSCIOUSLY TRYING TO PLAY ON THE DEMORALIZATION IN THE ARMY BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE INTERNAL AND INTERNATIONAL SITUATION OF THE COUNTRY AND TO THIS END ARE INSPIRING THE DISCOURAGED ELEMENTS WITH THE FALLACIOUS IDEA THAT THE VERY FACT OF A DRIVE CAN REHABILITATE THE ARMY
BUT THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY THE DEMONSTRATION WAS LOST AS SOON AS IT WAS REPORTED FROM THE FRONT THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY HAD ADVANCED TO ATTACK THE ENEMY ON THE VERY DAY THAT THE WORKINGMEN AND THE PETROGRAD GARRISON DEMANDED THE PUBLICATION OF THE SECRET TREATIES
BEEN LOOKING AT THE CUTTER FATHER OH SHE DON'T WANT NO LOOKING AT WHO BROUGHT THOSE COWS DOWN HERE JEMMY DADD HE'S A FOOL WE SHALL BE HAVING SOME OF EM GOING OVER THE CLIFF
THAT IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE THAT ANY GREAT PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION COULD HAVE BEEN SLAIN BUT THEN I NOTICED HOW YELLOW WERE THE SKINS OF THE PEOPLE I MET HOW SHAGGY THE HAIR OF THE MEN HOW LARGE AND BRIGHT THEIR EYES
THE CHURCH BELLS THAT HAD CEASED A FORTNIGHT SINCE SUDDENLY CAUGHT THE NEWS UNTIL ALL ENGLAND WAS BELL RINGING MEN ON CYCLES LEAN FACED UNKEMPT SCORCHED ALONG EVERY COUNTRY LANE SHOUTING OF UNHOPED DELIVERANCE
AND TO DAY ONE SEETH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN EVER YEA MINE ANIMALS ANSWERED HE YE COUNSEL ADMIRABLY AND ACCORDING TO MY HEART I WILL TO DAY ASCEND A HIGH MOUNTAIN
AND ABOVE ME WHAT ROSY RED STILLNESS
PREFERS TO REMAIN OUTSIDE WHERE HE WILL NEITHER PRICK OTHER PEOPLE
AND FROM THIS THOU DIDST GO ON TO ADD AS BY THE WAY THE PROOF THAT NO ONE WOULD BE HAPPY UNLESS HE WERE LIKEWISE GOD AGAIN THOU DIDST SAY THAT THE VERY FORM OF GOOD WAS THE ESSENCE BOTH OF GOD
I FOUND AMONGST A NUMBER OF OTHER PLANTS OF SIMILAR HEIGHT ONE THAT WAS DARK IN COLOR WITH TIGHTLY CLOSED LEAVES
AS IT HAPPENETH WITH ME SO IS IT WITH ALL FRUITS THAT TURN RIPE IT IS THE HONEY IN MY VEINS THAT MAKETH MY BLOOD THICKER AND ALSO MY SOUL STILLER
A NUMBER OF PORCUPINES HUDDLED TOGETHER FOR WARMTH ON A COLD DAY IN WINTER BUT AS THEY BEGAN TO PRICK ONE ANOTHER WITH THEIR QUILLS
THE MAN WHO GOES UP IN A BALLOON DOES NOT FEEL AS THOUGH HE WERE ASCENDING HE ONLY SEES THE EARTH SINKING DEEPER UNDER HIM THERE IS A MYSTERY
OUT ON THE SEA AND AWAY BEYOND SINUOUS ABYSSES THEN WENT HIS ANIMALS THOUGHTFULLY ROUND ABOUT HIM AND AT LAST SET THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF HIM
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER WAS ALOFT ON THE SUMMIT HE SENT HIS ANIMALS HOME THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM AND FOUND THAT HE WAS NOW ALONE
AND WHEN IT HAD ONCE COME TOGETHER
THOU HUMAN ABYSS OPEN UP AND THROW UNTO ME THY FISH AND SHINING CRABS WITH MY BEST BAIT SHALL I ALLURE TO MYSELF TO DAY THE STRANGEST HUMAN FISH
BUT LET HIM ALONE HE WILL NOT DIE TIME WILL COME AND BRING THOSE WHO KNOW HOW TO VALUE HIM
THOU NOW BRINGEST TO THE SEARCH EYES QUICKER IN DISCERNING TRUTH BUT WHAT I SHALL SAY NEXT IS NO LESS PLAIN AND EASY TO SEE WHAT IS IT SAID I WHY SAID SHE
HE WILL NEED NO EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE RULING OF THE WORLD OTHERWISE IF HE STANDS IN NEED OF AUGHT HE WILL NOT POSSESS COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE THAT IS NECESSARILY SO SAID I THEN
ALTHOUGH I NOW ANTICIPATE WHAT THOU INTENDEST I HAVE A DESIRE TO HEAR THE ARGUMENT PLAINLY SET FORTH AWHILE AGO THOU DEEMEDST IT BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT GOD DOTH GOVERN THE WORLD
BY HIS OWN POWER ALONE HE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IT CANNOT BE DENIED NOW GOD WAS PROVED TO BE ABSOLUTE GOOD
BUT ON THAT ACCOUNT IT IS NONE THE LESS SURE UNTO ME WITH BOTH FEET STAND I SECURE ON THIS GROUND ON AN ETERNAL GROUND
BUT SEE THAT HONEY IS THERE READY TO HAND YELLOW WHITE GOOD ICE COOL GOLDEN COMB HONEY FOR KNOW THAT WHEN ALOFT I WILL MAKE THE HONEY SACRIFICE
WITHOUT DISMAY BESIDE THE LION LAY THE HOUND BY SONG SUBDUED NO MORE THE HARE PURSUED
YOU HAVE THE ASTRONOMER AND THE PHILOSOPHER WISDOM WHICH IS ONLY THEORETICAL AND NEVER PUT INTO PRACTICE IS LIKE A DOUBLE ROSE
NO ONE AT ALL CAN QUESTION IT WHO THINKS CONSISTENTLY NOW THERE IS NOTHING WHICH ONE WHO IS ALL POWERFUL CANNOT DO NOTHING BUT CAN GOD DO EVIL THEN
THAT IS TO SAY OUR GREAT REMOTE HUMAN KINGDOM THE ZARATHUSTRA KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS HOW REMOTE MAY SUCH REMOTENESS BE WHAT DOTH IT CONCERN ME
GREATER NATURE COVERS ALL HER WORKS WITH A VARNISH OF BEAUTY LIKE THE TENDER BLOOM THAT IS BREATHED AS IT WERE ON THE SURFACE OF A PEACH OR A PLUM
POETRY AND ART WHICH IN CIVIC LIFE SO SEVERE BUT STILL USEFUL AND NOT WITHOUT ITS FRUIT PLAY THE SAME PART AS FLOWERS IN THE CORN
FOR SUCH IS THE FORM OF THE DIVINE ESSENCE THAT NEITHER CAN IT PASS INTO THINGS EXTERNAL NOR TAKE UP ANYTHING EXTERNAL INTO ITSELF BUT AS PARMENIDES SAYS OF IT
SINCE GOD IS RIGHTLY BELIEVED TO GOVERN ALL THINGS WITH THE RUDDER OF GOODNESS AND SINCE ALL THINGS DO LIKEWISE AS I HAVE TAUGHT HASTE TOWARDS GOOD BY THE VERY AIM OF NATURE CAN IT BE DOUBTED THAT HIS GOVERNANCE IS WILLINGLY ACCEPTED
THERE ARE SOME REALLY BEAUTIFULLY LANDSCAPES IN THE WORLD BUT THE HUMAN FIGURES IN THEM ARE POOR AND YOU HAD NOT BETTER LOOK AT THEM
ONE OF THEM DID NOTHING BUT STUDY THE MACHINERY AND HE SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT HOW IT WAS WORKED THE OTHER TRIED TO GET AT THE MEANING OF THE PIECE IN SPITE OF HIS IGNORANCE OF THE LANGUAGE HERE
SO THAT I HAVE TO DAY ASCENDED THIS HIGH MOUNTAIN TO CATCH FISH DID EVER ANY ONE CATCH FISH UPON HIGH MOUNTAINS AND THOUGH IT BE A FOLLY WHAT I HERE SEEK AND DO
FOR IN A WORLD OF NEED AND IMPERFECTION EVERYTHING IS SEIZED UPON WHICH CAN BE USED TO SATISFY WANT NOTHING IS EXEMPT FROM THIS SERVICE NO
SO RICH IS THE WORLD IN WONDERFUL THINGS GREAT AND SMALL ESPECIALLY THE HUMAN WORLD THE HUMAN SEA TOWARDS IT DO I NOW THROW OUT MY GOLDEN ANGLE ROD AND SAY OPEN UP
YOU CAN'T MAKE US BELIEVE THAT FOXES AND WOLVES AND RAVENS ARE ABLE TO TALK WE'VE GOT BEYOND STORIES OF THAT KIND IN THESE YOUNG HOPEFULS YOU HAVE THE ENLIGHTENED RATIONALISTS OF THE FUTURE
AND THUS TO SATISFY CERTAIN COARSE AND BRUTAL INSTINCTS OF THEIR OWN THUS IT IS THAT WE COME TO HAVE SO MANY CHARLATANS IN EVERY BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE THE CHARLATAN
WHICH ARE ALWAYS SELFISH AND MATERIAL EVERY HERO IS A SAMSON THE STRONG MAN SUCCUMBS TO THE INTRIGUES OF THE WEAK
LOOK AT THE THOUSANDS OF GAY BLOSSOMS WHICH COVER ME EVERYWHERE SAID THE APPLE TREE WHAT HAVE YOU TO SHOW IN COMPARISON DARK GREEN NEEDLES THAT IS TRUE REPLIED THE FIR
AND THE MANY AND IF IN THE END HE LOSES ALL PATIENCE HE CRUSHES BOTH THEM AND HIMSELF OR HE IS LIKE GULLIVER AT LILLIPUT
LONG BEFORE WE ENTER UPON LIFE ITSELF AND WHEN AFTERWARDS WE COME TO SEE THE WORKS OF NATURE FOR OURSELVES THE VARNISH IS GONE THE ARTISTS HAVE USED IT UP AND WE HAVE ENJOYED IT IN ADVANCE
WHEN I TOUCHED IT IT SAID TO ME IN FIRM TONES LET ME ALONE I AM NOT FOR YOUR COLLECTION LIKE THESE PLANTS TO WHICH NATURE HAS GIVEN ONLY A SINGLE YEAR OF LIFE I AM A LITTLE OAK
THEN HE LAUGHED FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART LOOKED AROUND HIM AND SPAKE THUS THAT I SPAKE OF SACRIFICES AND HONEY SACRIFICES IT WAS MERELY A RUSE IN TALKING AND VERILY
AND OF HAPPINESS AND DIDST TEACH THAT THE ABSOLUTE ONE WAS THE ABSOLUTE GOOD WHICH WAS SOUGHT BY UNIVERSAL NATURE
ALLURE FOR ME WITH THY GLITTERING THE FINEST HUMAN FISH AND WHATEVER BELONGETH UNTO ME IN ALL SEAS MY IN AND FOR ME IN ALL THINGS FISH THAT OUT FOR ME
NO PATIENT ONE RATHER ONE WHO HATH EVEN UNLEARNT PATIENCE BECAUSE HE NO LONGER SUFFERETH FOR MY FATE GIVETH ME TIME IT HATH FORGOTTEN ME PERHAPS
RICH SEA A SEA FULL OF MANY HUED FISHES AND CRABS FOR WHICH EVEN THE GODS MIGHT LONG AND MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO BECOME FISHERS IN IT AND CASTERS OF NETS
IN HIS OWN BOSOM RAGED THE MUSIC THAT COULD CALM ALL ELSE BROUGHT HIM NO BALM CHIDING THE POWERS IMMORTAL HE CAME UNTO HELL'S PORTAL
IT IS CONSEQUENTLY FOR THAT REASON THAT THOU THYSELF ALWAYS BECOMETH YELLOWER AND DARKER ALTHOUGH THY HAIR LOOKETH WHITE AND FLAXEN
WEAVING A LABYRINTH OF TANGLED ARGUMENTS NOW SEEMING TO BEGIN WHERE THOU DIDST END AND NOW TO END WHERE THOU DIDST BEGIN OR DOST THOU BUILD UP SOME WONDROUS CIRCLE OF DIVINE SIMPLICITY FOR TRULY
AS YET DO I NOT MYSELF GO DOWN AS I MUST DO AMONGST MEN THEREFORE DO I HERE WAIT CRAFTY AND SCORNFUL UPON HIGH MOUNTAINS NO IMPATIENT ONE
BRIEF DOTH FEEL FOR LO THE WHEEL STANDS STILL AND WHILE THOSE SAD NOTES THRILL THIRST MADDENED TANTALUS LISTENS OBLIVIOUS OF THE STREAM'S MOCKERY AND HIS LONG AGONY
FOURTH AND LAST PART AH WHERE IN THE WORLD HAVE THERE BEEN GREATER FOLLIES THAN WITH THE PITIFUL AND WHAT IN THE WORLD HATH CAUSED MORE SUFFERING THAN THE FOLLIES OF THE PITIFUL
WERE THERE NOT ONE WHO KEEPS TOGETHER WHAT HE HAS JOINED NOR WOULD THE ORDER OF NATURE PROCEED SO REGULARLY NOR COULD ITS COURSE EXHIBIT MOTIONS SO FIXED IN RESPECT OF POSITION TIME RANGE EFFICACY
A WIDE SPREADING APPLE TREE STOOD IN FULL BLOOM AND BEHIND IT A STRAIGHT FIR RAISED ITS DARK AND TAPERING HEAD
MY HAPPINESS ITSELF DO I THROW OUT INTO ALL PLACES FAR AND WIDE TWIXT ORIENT NOONTIDE AND OCCIDENT
PEOPLE COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS WANTING TO FIND IN IT SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE FOR THEMSELVES THEY STAND IN THE WAY AND SPOIL ITS EFFECT TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING SURPRISING IN THIS
TO HEAR THE PLAINTIVE STRAIN THE WOODS MOVED IN HIS TRAIN AND THE STREAM CEASED TO FLOW HELD BY SO SOFT A
THEN AFTER THROUGH THE STRESS OF HEAVY GRIEF THEN SHE CONTINUED IF THOU WILT REFLECT UPON THY FORMER ADMISSIONS IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE THOU DOST ALSO RECOLLECT THAT OF WHICH
UNTO THE CLEARER DAY IF ON THE DARKNESS PAST ONE BACKWARD LOOK YE CAST YOUR WEAK AND WANDERING EYES
NOT THAT I WOULD HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST SUCH WRATHFUL ONES ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY ARE WELL ENOUGH FOR LAUGHTER TO ME IMPATIENT MUST THEY NOW BE THOSE BIG ALARM DRUMS WHICH FIND A VOICE NOW OR NEVER
A LITTLE BEFORE THOU DIDST BEGIN WITH HAPPINESS AND SAY IT WAS THE SUPREME GOOD AND DIDST DECLARE IT TO BE SEATED IN THE SUPREME GODHEAD GOD HIMSELF TOO
OVERWHELMED BY AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF LITTLE MEN A MOTHER GAVE HER CHILDREN AESOP'S FABLES TO READ IN THE HOPE OF EDUCATING AND IMPROVING THEIR MINDS
UNTIL BITING AT MY SHARP HIDDEN HOOKS THEY HAVE TO COME UP UNTO MY HEIGHT THE MOTLEYEST ABYSS GROUNDLINGS TO THE WICKEDEST OF ALL FISHERS OF MEN
IT IS HIS LOVE FOR MAN AND LATELY
BUT IN TWO ENTIRELY OPPOSITE WAYS ACCORDING AS IT IS HIS PHYSICAL OR HIS MENTAL STATURE THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING THE ONE WILL SEEM SMALLER THE FARTHER OFF YOU MOVE THE OTHER
OF HIS SONG ONE SOLE CONDITION YET UPON THE BOON IS SET LET HIM NOT TURN HIS EYES TO VIEW HIS HARD WON PRIZE TILL THEY SECURELY PASS THE GATES OF HELL ALAS WHAT LAW
ONCE ON A TIME BECOME WHAT THOU ART THUS MAY MEN NOW COME UP TO ME FOR AS YET DO I AWAIT THE SIGNS THAT IT IS TIME FOR MY DOWN GOING
THUS IT IS THAT THE WORLD SO OFTEN APPEARS HARSH AND DEVOID OF CHARM NAY ACTUALLY REPULSIVE IT WERE BETTER TO LEAVE US TO DISCOVER THE VARNISH FOR OURSELVES THIS WOULD MEAN
THE VULTURE TOO DOTH SPARE SOME LITTLE WHILE TO TEAR
AND WILL NOT LEAVE ME AND IS LIKE MOLTEN PITCH THEN WENT HIS ANIMALS AGAIN THOUGHTFULLY AROUND HIM AND PLACED THEMSELVES ONCE MORE IN FRONT OF HIM O ZARATHUSTRA SAID THEY
THOU DIDST UNFOLD WITHOUT THE HELP OF ASSUMPTIONS FROM WITHOUT BUT BY INHERENT AND PROPER PROOFS DRAWING CREDENCE ONE FROM THE OTHER THEN ANSWERED SHE FAR IS IT FROM ME TO MOCK THEE NAY
A FEW PARABLES IN A FIELD OF RIPENING CORN I CAME TO A PLACE WHICH HAD BEEN TRAMPLED DOWN BY SOME RUTHLESS FOOT
MYSELF HOWEVER AND MY FATE WE DO NOT TALK TO THE PRESENT NEITHER DO WE TALK TO THE NEVER FOR TALKING WE HAVE PATIENCE AND TIME AND MORE THAN TIME
SAID SHE IT IS THE SUPREME GOOD WHICH RULES IN STRENGTH AND GRACIOUSLY DISPOSES ALL THINGS THEN SAID I HOW DELIGHTED AM I AT THY REASONINGS AND THE CONCLUSION TO WHICH THOU HAST BROUGHT THEM
THOU DIDST MAINTAIN ALSO THAT GOD RULES THE UNIVERSE BY THE GOVERNANCE OF GOODNESS THAT ALL THINGS OBEY HIM WILLINGLY AND THAT EVIL HAS NO EXISTENCE IN NATURE AND ALL THIS
IS SO SHUT IN BY THE HOUSES THAT ARE BUILT ROUND ABOUT IT THAT THERE IS NO ONE SPOT FROM WHICH YOU CAN SEE IT AS A WHOLE THIS IS SYMBOLIC OF EVERYTHING GREAT OR BEAUTIFUL IN THE WORLD
AS THE ECHOES WAKEN ALL TAENARUS IS SHAKEN WHILST HE TO RUTH PERSUADES
OF MUTUAL COLLISION IT MAY BE FROM THE IMPACT SOME FAIR SPARK OF TRUTH MAY BE STRUCK OUT IF IT BE THY GOOD PLEASURE SAID I NO ONE CAN DOUBT THAT GOD IS ALL POWERFUL
THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DISPERSE HOWEVER THE COLD DROVE THEM TOGETHER AGAIN WHEN JUST THE SAME THING HAPPENED AT LAST AFTER MANY TURNS OF HUDDLING AND DISPERSING
SO WILL IT BE O ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED HIS ANIMALS AND PRESSED UP TO HIM BUT WILT THOU NOT TO DAY ASCEND A HIGH MOUNTAIN THE AIR IS PURE
FOR ONE DAY MUST IT YET COME AND MAY NOT PASS BY WHAT MUST ONE DAY COME AND MAY NOT PASS BY OUR GREAT HAZAR
IT IS NOT LONG BEFORE PEOPLE SNEAK UP TO THEM UNDER THE PRETENCE OF WISHING TO FURTHER THOSE SPECIAL ENDS WHILE THEY ARE REALLY LED ON BY THE DESIRE TO SECURE THE EMOLUMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN LEFT FOR THEIR FURTHERANCE
BESIDE THE FOUNT OF GOOD BLEST HE WHOSE WILL COULD BREAK EARTH'S CHAINS FOR WISDOM'S SAKE THE THRACIAN BARD TIS SAID MOURNED HIS DEAR CONSORT DEAD
THE MUTUAL NEED OF WARMTH IS ONLY VERY MODERATELY SATISFIED BUT THEN PEOPLE DO NOT GET PRICKED
EVEN BEFORE HE COMES NEAR THEM THE FLY LIGHTS UPON HIS VERY NOSE TWO CHINAMEN TRAVELING IN EUROPE WENT TO THE THEATRE FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN BODY LIKE TO A SPHERE ON ALL SIDES PERFECTLY ROUNDED IT ROLLS THE RESTLESS ORB OF THE UNIVERSE KEEPING ITSELF MOTIONLESS THE WHILE
THE FLY SHOULD BE USED AS THE SYMBOL OF IMPERTINENCE AND AUDACITY FOR WHILST ALL OTHER ANIMALS SHUN MAN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND RUN AWAY
A SQUANDERER WITH A THOUSAND HANDS HOW COULD I CALL THAT SACRIFICING AND WHEN I DESIRED HONEY I ONLY DESIRED BAIT AND SWEET MUCUS AND MUCILAGE
EVERY ONE OF THEM ALIKE STANDING THERE SO ERECT AND BEARING THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE EAR
IS THE CODE OF POLITENESS AND FINE MANNERS AND THOSE WHO TRANSGRESS IT ARE ROUGHLY TOLD IN THE ENGLISH PHRASE TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE BY THIS ARRANGEMENT
A POSTURING WRATH SNORTER WITH WAITING A HOLY HOWL STORM FROM THE MOUNTAINS AN IMPATIENT ONE THAT SHOUTETH DOWN INTO THE VALLEYS HEARKEN ELSE I WILL SCOURGE YOU WITH THE SCOURGE OF GOD
AND CHARACTER UNLESS THERE WERE ONE WHO HIMSELF ABIDING DISPOSED THESE VARIOUS VICISSITUDES OF CHANGE THIS POWER WHATSOEVER IT BE WHEREBY THEY REMAIN AS THEY WERE CREATED AND ARE KEPT IN MOTION
AS HUNTSMEN AND FISHERMEN REQUIRE IT FOR IF THE WORLD BE AS A GLOOMY FOREST OF ANIMALS AND A PLEASURE GROUND FOR ALL WILD HUNTSMEN IT SEEMETH TO ME RATHER AND PREFERABLY A FATHOMLESS
DAY'S THRESHOLD ALL BUT WON LOOKED LOST AND WAS UNDONE YE WHO THE LIGHT PURSUE THIS STORY IS FOR YOU WHO SEEK TO FIND A WAY
THEN SAID I WITH ALL MY HEART I AGREE WITH PLATO INDEED THIS IS NOW THE SECOND TIME THAT THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO MY MIND FIRST I LOST THEM THROUGH THE CLOGGING CONTACT OF THE BODY
FOR THAT DO I WAIT THE WICKEDEST OF ALL FISH CATCHERS OUT OUT MY FISHING HOOK IN AND DOWN THOU BAIT OF MY HAPPINESS DRIP THY SWEETEST DEW
BUT WHEN WINTER COMES YOU WILL BE BARED OF YOUR GLORY AND I SHALL BE AS I AM NOW ONCE AS I WAS BOTANIZING UNDER AN OAK
FALLS CROUCHING AT HIS FEET THE DREAD AVENGERS TOO THAT GUILTY MINDS PURSUE WITH EVER HAUNTING FEARS ARE ALL DISSOLVED IN TEARS IXION ON HIS WHEEL A RESPITE
AND GENERALLY TO AFFORD HELP TO THOSE INTELLECTUAL EFFORTS WHICH ENNOBLE THE RACE WHEREVER THESE INSTITUTIONS MAY BE
THIS IS ESPECIALLY ILLUSTRATED AND CORROBORATED IN THE CASE OF INSTITUTIONS WHETHER GREAT OR SMALL WEALTHY OR POOR FOUNDED NO MATTER IN WHAT CENTURY OR IN WHAT LAND TO MAINTAIN AND ADVANCE HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
LO THOU SITTEST IN THY PITCH WHAT DO YE SAY MINE ANIMALS SAID ZARATHUSTRA LAUGHING VERILY I REVILED WHEN I SPAKE OF PITCH
THOU HONEY OF MY HEART BITE MY FISHING HOOK INTO THE BELLY OF ALL BLACK AFFLICTION LOOK OUT LOOK OUT MINE EYE OH HOW MANY SEAS ROUND ABOUT ME WHAT DAWNING HUMAN FUTURES
BUT MOST OF ALL AT THESE VERY WORDS WHICH THOU USEST I AM NOW AT LAST ASHAMED OF THE FOLLY THAT SO SORELY VEXED ME THOU HAST HEARD THE STORY OF THE GIANTS ASSAILING HEAVEN
NOT EVEN THOSE VERY THINGS WHICH ARISE ONLY WHEN NEED AND WANT ARE FOR A MOMENT LOST SIGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE TRUE SOUGHT FOR THEIR OWN SAKES
THAT WE SHOULD NOT ENJOY IT ALL AT ONCE AND IN LARGE QUANTITIES WE SHOULD HAVE NO FINISHED PICTURES NO PERFECT POEMS BUT WE SHOULD LOOK AT ALL THINGS IN THAT GENIAL AND PLEASING LIGHT IN WHICH
ERSTWHILE THOU DIDST CONFESS THYSELF IGNORANT WHAT IS THAT SAID I THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WORLD'S GOVERNMENT SAID SHE YES I REMEMBER MY CONFESSION AND
HEARTILY DO I AGREE AND INDEED I ANTICIPATED WHAT THOU WOULDST SAY THOUGH IT MAY BE IN FEEBLE SURMISE ONLY I WELL BELIEVE IT SAID SHE FOR AS I THINK
EVEN NOW A CHILD OF NATURE SOMETIMES SEES THEM SOME ONE WHO HAS NOT ANTICIPATED HIS AESTHETIC PLEASURES BY THE HELP OF ART OR TAKEN THE CHARMS OF LIFE TOO EARLY
I DO NOT THINK IT DOUBTFUL NOW NOR SHALL I EVER AND BY WHAT REASONS I AM BROUGHT TO THIS ASSURANCE I WILL BRIEFLY SET FORTH
IN THE SAME WAY THE NEED OF SOCIETY DRIVES THE HUMAN PORCUPINES TOGETHER ONLY TO BE MUTUALLY REPELLED BY THE MANY PRICKLY AND DISAGREEABLE QUALITIES OF THEIR NATURE
UNTO WHICH ALL WINDS COME AS UNTO THE STORM PARTING ASKING WHERE AND WHENCE AND WHITHER HERE LAUGH LAUGH MY HEARTY HEALTHY WICKEDNESS FROM HIGH MOUNTAINS CAST DOWN THY GLITTERING SCORN LAUGHTER
TAKES VERY DIFFERENT SHAPES ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES BUT AT BOTTOM HE IS A MAN WHO CARES NOTHING ABOUT KNOWLEDGE FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND ONLY STRIVES TO GAIN THE SEMBLANCE OF IT THAT HE MAY USE IT FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL ENDS
BUT LET US GIVE OUR ATTENTION TO THE TASK THAT WE HAVE SET BEFORE OURSELVES HAVE WE NOT COUNTED INDEPENDENCE IN THE CATEGORY OF HAPPINESS AND AGREED THAT GOD IS ABSOLUTE HAPPINESS TRULY WE HAVE THEN
BY THE BLESSING OF GOD WHOM WE LATELY ADDRESSED IN PRAYER
SUFFERED TO REMAIN ONLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO GETTING RID OF THEM AND YET BUT FOR THESE FLOWERS THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO CHARM THE EYE IN THAT WILDERNESS OF STALKS THEY ARE EMBLEMATIC OF
FOR THIS AM I FROM THE HEART AND FROM THE BEGINNING DRAWING HITHER DRAWING UPWARD DRAWING UPBRINGING A DRAWER A TRAINER A TRAINING MASTER
THEN HE DISPOSES ALL THINGS BY THE AGENCY OF GOOD IF IT BE TRUE THAT HE RULES ALL THINGS BY HIS OWN POWER WHOM WE HAVE AGREED TO BE GOOD AND HE IS AS IT WERE THE RUDDER AND HELM BY WHICH THE WORLD'S MECHANISM IS KEPT STEADY AND IN ORDER
WHICH ONLY THOSE WILL UNDERSTAND WHO FEEL THE TRUTH OF IT YOUR ESTIMATION OF A MAN'S SIZE WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE DISTANCE AT WHICH YOU STAND FROM HIM
IT BEGAN TO BE THE IMPRESSION OF ALL THAT ARMS WOULD BE RESORTED TO AND ALL PRUDENT PERSONS APPREHENDED SOME APPROACHING EVIL
MANY OTHERS WHETHER ENVIOUS OF THOSE IN POWER OR FEARING A RUPTURE WITH THE DUKE CONSIDERED IT UNADVISABLE SO LIGHTLY TO ENTERTAIN SUSPICIONS OF AN ALLY
BUT RACHEL ONLY COLORED KEPT HER EYES FIXED ON HER WORK AND WAS MORE RESERVED THAN EVER THIS INTERESTED CHRISTIE
OR BE UNDER THE COMMAND OF SOME INDIVIDUAL WHO MIGHT MAKE HIMSELF PRINCE FOR THESE REASONS HE WAS OF OPINION THAT WHOEVER LOVED HIS COUNTRY AND HIS HONOR MUST AROUSE HIMSELF AND CALL TO MIND
AND OVERTURN THE GOVERNMENT WHICH FOR FORTY TWO YEARS HAD RULED THE CITY WITH SO MUCH GLORY THE CITIZENS WOULD THEN BE SUBJECT TO THE WILL OF THE MULTITUDE AND LIVE DISORDERLY AND DANGEROUS
SO FREELY OFFERED IT CHRISTIE WAS SURE OF THIS
HE THEN MODESTLY REMINDED THEM OF WHAT HE HAD SAID UPON A FORMER OCCASION AND OF THEIR RELUCTANCE TO REMEDY THE EVIL WHEN IT MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN DONE
AND LAPO NICCOLINI THE FACTIONS THAT AROSE FROM THE QUARRELS OF THE ALBIZZI AND THE RICCI AND WHICH WERE AFTERWARD SO UNHAPPILY REVIVED BY SALVESTRO DE MEDICI
WHO MAY BE REMOVED BY DEATH OR BECOME UNSERVICEABLE BY MISFORTUNE HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WHICH COMMENCED IN FLORENCE AT THE DEATH OF GIORGIO SCALI IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
MOST ASSUREDLY SHE WOULD HAVE GONE TO FIND THESE THINGS LED BY THE INSTINCTS OF A HEALTHFUL NATURE HAD NOT ONE SLENDER TIE HELD HER TILL IT GREW INTO A BOND SO STRONG SHE COULD NOT BREAK IT
FOR A WHILE IT DIVERTED CHRISTIE AS SHE HAD A FEMININE LOVE FOR PRETTY THINGS AND ENJOYED SEEING DELICATE SILKS COSTLY LACE AND ALL THE INDESCRIBABLE FANTASIES OF FASHION
THE GOOD SOUL HAD VENTURED SOUTH AND TRIED TO BUY HER MOTHER BUT OLE MISSIS WOULD NOT LET HER GO AT ANY PRICE AND THE FAITHFUL CHATTEL WOULD NOT RUN AWAY
AS THEY MIGHT DO IF ASSAILED AND THAT MEN ALWAYS DEFEND THEMSELVES MORE VIGOROUSLY WHEN THEY ATTACK OTHERS THE ADVOCATES OF WAR CONSIDERED IT IMPROPER TO AWAIT THE ENEMY IN THEIR HOUSES
WITH A MUTE ELOQUENCE SHE COULD NOT RESIST IN VAIN DID RACHEL ANSWER HER WITH QUIET COLDNESS NOD SILENTLY WHEN SHE WISHED HER A CHEERY GOOD MORNING AND KEEP RESOLUTELY IN HER OWN SOMEWHAT ISOLATED CORNER
BY MEANS OF WHOM HE MIGHT BE HUMBLED THIS WAS THE STATE OF FLORENCE IN WHICH OPPOSING FEELINGS BEGAN TO BE OBSERVABLE WHEN FILIPPO VISCONTI
HE REMINDED THEM OF THE INIQUITY OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS IN POWER FROM THIRTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE USED LIKE DOGS AND THE REST WERE DESIROUS THAT THE TAXATION SHOULD BE EQUALIZED
WHO BY THE RUIN OF THE ALBERTI RESCUED THE CITY FROM THE DANGERS THEN IMPENDING AND THAT THE CAUSE OF THE AUDACITY NOW ASSUMED BY THE MULTITUDE WAS THE EXTENSIVE SQUITTINI OR POLLINGS WHICH BY THEIR NEGLIGENCE
FOR HER OWN HEART WAS VERY SOLITARY SHE MISSED HELEN AND LONGED TO FILL THE EMPTY PLACE
AND MORE SOLITARY THAN HERSELF
FROM THE POWERFUL ENEMIES WHICH EACH CONDITION CREATES ITSELF THEY NEITHER HAVE NOR CAN POSSESS ANY STABILITY FOR TYRANNY CANNOT PLEASE THE GOOD AND LICENSE IS OFFENSIVE TO THE WISE
FILIPPO VISCONTI DUKE OF MILAN
BUT REMEMBER I DIDN'T ASK IT FIRST SAID RACHEL HALF DROPPING THE HAND SHE HAD HELD IN BOTH HER OWN YOU PROUD CREATURE I'LL REMEMBER
AND ALL BEING ANXIOUS THAT THE ENEMY SHOULD NOT OBTAIN THE EXPECTED ADVANTAGE THEY ENABLED HIM TO SECURE A GREATER FOR HAVING ABANDONED THE SIEGE OF FURLI TO GO TO THE RELIEF OF ZAGONARA
PREVAILED THE COUNCIL OF TEN WERE APPOINTED FORCES WERE HIRED AND NEW TAXES LEVIED WHICH AS THEY WERE MORE BURDENSOME UPON THE LOWER THAN THE UPPER RANKS FILLED THE CITY
MIGHT BE UNABLE TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF HIS GRANDSON AGNOLO APPROACHED IMOLA WHILE THE FORCES OF THE FLORENTINES WERE AT MODIGLIANA
AND HE HAD BESIDES ENTERED INTO ANOTHER TREATY WITH THE LEGATE OF BOLOGNA
SHE LIKED TO RETURN AT NIGHT TO HER OWN LITTLE HOME SOLITARY AND SIMPLE AS IT WAS AND FELT A GREAT REPUGNANCE TO ACCEPT ANY PLACE WHERE SHE WOULD BE MIXED UP WITH FAMILY AFFAIRS AGAIN
AND TRY IF HE COULD INDUCE HIM TO JOIN THEM HE UNDERTOOK THIS COMMISSION AND IN THE MOST PREVAILING WORDS HE COULD MAKE USE OF
THE FLORENTINES FINDING IMOLA IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY AND THE WAR PUBLICLY KNOWN SENT THEIR FORCES TO FURLI AND BESIEGED IT ON ALL SIDES THAT THE DUKE'S PEOPLE MIGHT NOT RELIEVE IT
AND ADVISED THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF RELIEF BUT THEIR ADVICE WAS REJECTED IN THE COUNCILS THEREFORE TO RENDER THE LAW AS OFFENSIVE AS POSSIBLE
AND AMONG THE REST GIOVANNI DE MEDICI WHO PUBLICLY ENDEAVORED TO SHOW
DESTROYED THAT VIGILANCE OVER THOSE WHO MIGHT INJURE THEM WHICH THEY OUGHT TO HAVE EXERCISED THUS DAILY RENEWING THE HATRED OF A MASS OF THE PEOPLE BY THEIR SINISTER PROCEEDINGS
THOUGH INVITED TO SHARE THE SUNNY WINDOW WHERE THE OTHER SAT HER EYES BELIED HER WORDS AND THOSE FUGITIVE GLANCES BETRAYED THE LONGING OF A LONELY HEART
REDUCED IT ALMOST TO NOTHING THE FIRST FAMILIES THAT SUFFERED IN THIS WAY WERE THE ALBERTI THE
WHO HAD HITHERTO BEEN MERELY THE LEADERS OF THE RABBLE HAVING REPEATEDLY DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO MEET AGAIN AT AN APPOINTED HOUR
MEASURES FOR THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR ATTEMPT OF THE HIGHER CLASSES TO DEPRIVE THE PLEBEIANS OF THEIR SHARE IN THE GOVERNMENT
WITH THE PERMISSION OF LORENZO RIDOLFI AND FRANCESCO GIANFIGLIAZZI
AND THAT GIOVANNI POSSESSED SEVERAL QUALITIES FAR SURPASSING THOSE OF SALVESTRO THE ASSOCIATES OF NICCOLO WERE UNINFLUENCED BY HIS REMARKS FOR THEY WERE JEALOUS OF HIS REPUTATION AND DESIRED TO EXALT SOME PERSON
SO A FAREWELL FESTIVAL WAS HELD AND CHRISTIE WENT TO IT FEELING MORE SOLITARY THAN EVER AS SHE BADE HER OLD FRIENDS A LONG GOOD BYE THE REST OF THE MONEY BURNED IN HER POCKET
BUT EVERYTHING TENDED TO EXCITE SUSPICION
TO WHOM WILL THEY FLEE FOR ASSISTANCE NOW TO POPE MARTIN WHOM THEY RIDICULED BEFORE THE FACE OF BRACCIO OR TO QUEEN GIOVANNA WHOM THEY ABANDONED
THESE OFT REPEATED ACTS OF OPPRESSION HUMILIATED THE FACTION AND ALMOST ANNIHILATED IT
SOME A FATHER OTHERS A GRANDFATHER PUT TO DEATH BY ITS TYRANNY HE ASSURED THEM THEY WERE NOW IN THE SAME DANGER AND THAT THE CITY WAS SINKING UNDER THE SAME DISORDERS
IN THE FORMER THE INSOLENT HAVE TOO MUCH AUTHORITY AND IN THE LATTER THE FOOLISH
THEY HIRED COUNT ALBERIGO WHO FROM ZAGONARA HIS OWN DOMAIN OVERRAN THE COUNTRY DAILY UP TO THE GATES OF IMOLA AGNOLO DELLA PERGOLA
THEIR JEALOUSY OF HIM
THEIR LOSS WOULD BE STILL GREATER IF THEY ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE DEJECTED BUT IF THEY SET A BOLD FRONT AGAINST ADVERSITY AND MADE GOOD USE OF THE MEANS WITHIN THEIR POWER
UPON CONDITION THAT IF HE WISHED TO ALIENATE THEM THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE GENOESE IT
OR KNOW WHAT A BLESSED THING IT IS TO FIND SUCH AN ONE AS YOU ARE THEN I MAY LOVE YOU AND NOT BE AFRAID OF OFFENDING CRIED CHRISTIE MUCH TOUCHED YES
HER EVENINGS AT HOME WERE DEVOTED TO BOOKS FOR SHE HAD THE TRUE NEW ENGLAND WOMAN'S DESIRE FOR EDUCATION AND READ OR STUDIED FOR THE LOVE OF IT THUS SHE HAD MUCH TO THINK OF AS HER NEEDLE FLEW
RINALDO DEGLI ALBIZZI ADDRESSES AN ASSEMBLY OF CITIZENS AND ADVISES THE RESTORATION OF THE GRANDI
DECLARING THAT TO GRATIFY THEMSELVES AND OPPRESS THE PEOPLE THEY WOULD GO TO WAR WITHOUT ANY JUSTIFIABLE MOTIVE THEY HAD NOT YET COME TO AN OPEN RUPTURE WITH THE DUKE
WHO AT THE CORNERS OF STREETS INSULTED THEM WITH SARCASTIC EXPRESSIONS COMPLAINING OF THE HEAVY TAXES AND THE UNNECESSARY WAR AND SAYING OH THEY APPOINTED THE TEN TO FRIGHTEN THE ENEMY HAVE THEY RELIEVED FURLI
WHICH HE OBTAINED ON CONDITION OF GIVING UP ZAGONARA IF THE FLORENTINES DID NOT RELIEVE HIM WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS THIS MISFORTUNE BEING KNOWN IN THE FLORENTINE CAMP AND IN THE CITY
HENCE FOLLOWED MANY LAMENTABLE COLLISIONS
WHO WAS IN FEAR OF ANTONIO BENTIVOGLI AN EMIGRANT OF BOLOGNA AT CASTEL BOLOGNESE SENT FORCES TO THAT CITY WHICH BEING CLOSE UPON THE FLORENTINE TERRITORY FILLED THE CITIZENS WITH APPREHENSION
BOB O' LINKS MAKING RAPTUROUS MUSIC BY THE RIVER AND THE SMELL OF NEW MOWN HAY
SO DAY AFTER DAY SHE WENT TO HER SEAT IN THE WORKROOM WHERE A DOZEN OTHER YOUNG WOMEN SAT SEWING BUSILY ON GAY GARMENTS WITH AS MUCH LIVELY GOSSIP TO BEGUILE THE TIME AS MISS COTTON THE FOREWOMAN WOULD ALLOW
THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF WAR WERE GREATLY STRENGTHENED BUT
WHICH IT HAD LACKED BEFORE NOW SOME ONE CARED FOR HER AND BETTER STILL SHE COULD MAKE SOME ONE HAPPY AND IN THE ACT OF LAVISHING THE AFFECTION OF HER GENEROUS NATURE ON A CREATURE SADDER
AND IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE WAS PUT DOWN STILL AS IT COMPREHENDED THE GREATEST NUMERICAL PROPORTION IT WAS NEVER ENTIRELY EXTINCT THOUGH THE FREQUENT BALIAS AND PERSECUTIONS OF ITS LEADERS FROM THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
WAR DECLARED THE FLORENTINES ARE ROUTED BY THE DUCAL FORCES REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENTS MORE ESPECIALLY THOSE IMPERFECTLY ORGANIZED FREQUENTLY CHANGE THEIR RULERS AND THE FORM OF THEIR INSTITUTIONS
THEY WOULD NOT BE SENSIBLE OF THEIR LOSS OR THE DUKE OF HIS VICTORY HE ASSURED THEM THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE ALARMED BY IMPENDING EXPENSES AND CONSEQUENT TAXATION BECAUSE THE LATTER MIGHT BE REDUCED
THE DISSATISFACTION OF THE FLORENTINES COMING TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF FILIPPO HE EITHER TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF OR TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR PREVAILING FEELINGS
THERE WAS NOTHING IN HER POSSESSION THAT SHE DID NOT OFFER RACHEL
BUT WHAT GAVE EVERY ONE GREATER ALARM AND OFFERED SUFFICIENT OCCASION FOR THE DECLARATION OF WAR WAS THE EXPEDITION MADE BY THE DUKE AGAINST FURLI
WHICH ENJOYED FREEDOM UNDER THE DOGIATE OF TOMMASO DA CAMPO FREGOSO HE DID NOT THINK IT ADVISABLE TO ATTEMPT THIS
BUT IF THEY WERE TO STRIKE THE FIRST BLOW AT THE DUKE PUBLIC OPINION WOULD BE AS FAVORABLE TO HIM AS TO THEMSELVES AND BESIDES THEY COULD NOT SO CONFIDENTLY DEMAND ASSISTANCE AS ASSAILANTS
THE DUKE TOOK POSSESSION OF BRESCIA AND SHORTLY AFTERWARD OF GENOA CONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATION OF THOSE WHO HAD ADVOCATED PEACE FOR THEY THOUGHT BRESCIA WOULD BE DEFENDED BY THE VENETIANS AND GENOA
TOOK COURAGE AND DRAINED THEM WITHOUT MERCY
LICENSE AND SLAVERY PECULIAR DEFECTS IN REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENTS APPLICATION OF THIS REFLECTION TO THE STATE OF FLORENCE GIOVANNI DI BICCI DI MEDICI RE ESTABLISHES THE AUTHORITY OF HIS FAMILY
AND THE FUTURE EXPENSE WOULD NOT BE SO GREAT AS THE FORMER HAD BEEN FOR LESS PREPARATION IS NECESSARY FOR THOSE ENGAGED IN SELF DEFENSE THAN FOR THOSE WHO DESIGN TO ATTACK OTHERS
AND THE VICINITY OF THE CHURCH OUGHT TO PREVENT ANY ATTEMPT AGAINST ROMAGNA ITSELF HOWEVER
AND BETTER TO GO AND SEEK HIM THAT FORTUNE IS ALWAYS MORE FAVORABLE TO ASSAILANTS THAN TO SUCH AS MERELY ACT ON THE DEFENSIVE AND THAT IT IS LESS INJURIOUS EVEN WHEN ATTENDED WITH GREATER IMMEDIATE EXPENSE
TO THESE REPROACHES WAS ADDED ALL THAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM AN ENRAGED MULTITUDE SEEING THE DISCONTENT SO PREVALENT
ITS INSTITUTIONS FIRM AND SECURE FOR HAVING GOOD LAWS FOR ITS BASIS AND GOOD REGULATIONS FOR CARRYING THEM INTO EFFECT IT NEEDS NOT LIKE OTHERS
TO SEND GUIDO TORELLO AS HIS AGENT WITH FORCES TO SEIZE THE GOVERNMENT OF FURLI AND THUS THE TERRITORY FELL INTO THE DUKE'S HANDS WHEN THIS WAS KNOWN AT FLORENCE
THAT NOW THE SAME REMEDY COULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED WITHOUT INCURRING THE DANGER OF GREATER EVILS AND THEREFORE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR THEM TO DO
AND THEN BY THOSE OF NICCOLO DA UZZANO THE CITY REMAINED TRANQUIL FROM FOURTEEN FOURTEEN TO FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO
THESE THINGS DISTURBED THE MINDS OF THE CITIZENS AND MADE THEM APPREHENSIVE OF NEW TROUBLES CONSIDER THE MEANS TO BE ADOPTED FOR THEIR DEFENSE
AND THE EYES WERE OLD WITH THAT INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION WHICH COMES TO THOSE WHO COUNT THEIR LIVES BY EMOTIONS NOT BY YEARS STRANGELY HAUNTING EYES TO CHRISTIE FOR THEY SEEMED TO APPEAL TO HER
AND OFTEN STOPPED TO ADMIRE THE WORK OF HER TASTEFUL FINGERS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST SUCH FRIENDLY OVERTURES
WHILE THE FORMER BRINGS ALIKE GRATIFICATION AND PROFIT THEN DIRECTING HIS DISCOURSE MORE PARTICULARLY TO RINALDO HE SAID
HE WOULD GAIN FEW FRIENDS AND MAKE MANY ENEMIES
AND THOUGHT HIS PROCEEDINGS NEED NOT HAVE EXCITED SO MUCH DISTRUST THAT APPOINTING THE TEN AND HIRING FORCES WAS IN ITSELF A MANIFEST DECLARATION OF WAR WHICH IF UNDERTAKEN AGAINST SO GREAT A PRINCE
SHE TOOK INFINITE SATISFACTION IN SENDING ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO UNCLE ENOS
THAT IF WE ARE TO APPLAUD EVIL COUNSELS BECAUSE THEY ARE SOMETIMES FOLLOWED BY FORTUNATE EVENTS WE SHOULD ONLY ENCOURAGE MEN IN ERROR WHICH WOULD BRING GREAT MISCHIEF UPON THE REPUBLIC
WHOSE BLACK DRESS PECULIAR FACE AND SILENT WAYS ATTRACTED CHRISTIE HER EVIDENT DESIRE TO BE LET ALONE AMUSED THE NEW COMER AT FIRST AND SHE MADE NO EFFORT TO KNOW HER BUT PRESENTLY SHE BECAME AWARE
BY REDUCING THE COMPANIES FROM FOURTEEN TO SEVEN
BUT NONE FELT IT SO SEVERELY AS THE NOBILITY WHO HAD BEEN IN FAVOR OF THE WAR FOR THEY PERCEIVED THEIR ENEMIES TO BE INSPIRITED AND THEMSELVES DISARMED WITHOUT FRIENDS AND OPPOSED BY THE PEOPLE
CHRISTIE KEPT HER WORD ASKED NO QUESTIONS VOLUNTEERED NO CONFIDENCES BUT HEARTILY ENJOYED THE NEW FRIENDSHIP
TO THESE THEY ADDED OTHER LEADERS AND REMOUNTED SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD LOST THEIR HORSES IN THE LATE DEFEAT THEY ALSO APPOINTED TWENTY CITIZENS TO LEVY NEW TAXES
AND MADE HIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING WITH THEM KNOWN BUT WITH THE AID OF THEIR REPUTATION HE TRUSTED HE SHOULD ATTAIN HIS WISHES HE THEREFORE SENT AMBASSADORS TO FLORENCE TO SIGNIFY HIS DESIRES
AND PLACE HIM IN THE HANDS OF THE DUKE UPON THIS FILIPPO
NOT BY THE INFLUENCE OF LIBERTY OR SUBJECTION AS MANY SUPPOSE BUT BY THAT OF SLAVERY AND LICENSE FOR WITH THE NOBILITY OR THE PEOPLE THE MINISTERS RESPECTIVELY OF SLAVERY OR LICENTIOUSNESS
HAVING BY THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER BECOME MASTER OF ALL LOMBARDY AND THINKING HE MIGHT UNDERTAKE ALMOST ANYTHING
AND AS IN THE TREATY WHICH FILIPPO MADE WITH THE DOGE OF GENOA
FOR I CAN HELP IN NO OTHER WAY AND IF I NEED MONEY I CAN ALWAYS EARN IT THANK GOD SAID CHRISTIE AS HEPSEY HESITATED TO TAKE SO MUCH FROM A FELLOW WORKER
AND WHEN WE QUARREL I'LL TAKE ALL THE BLAME UPON MYSELF THEN CHRISTIE KISSED HER WARMLY WHISKED AWAY THE TEAR
UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF FILIPPO THE BOY'S MOTHER SUSPICIOUS OF HIS GUARDIAN SENT HIM TO LODOVICO ALIDOSSI HER FATHER WHO WAS LORD OF IMOLA BUT SHE WAS COMPELLED
AND THEIR DULL LIFE FOSTERED
SO THAT THERE WAS NOTHING EITHER INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL TO OCCASION UNEASINESS NEXT TO NICCOLO DA UZZANO IN AUTHORITY WERE BARTOLOMEO VALORI
ENABLE THEM TO COMPLETE THE RUIN BOTH OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CITY TO THIS GIOVANNI REPLIED THAT HE CONSIDERED IT THE DUTY OF A GOOD AND WISE CITIZEN TO AVOID ALTERING THE INSTITUTIONS
AND TO MAKE ALL SENSIBLE OF ITS INJUSTICE THEY CONTRIVED THAT THE TAXES SHOULD BE LEVIED WITH THE UTMOST RIGOR AND MADE IT LAWFUL TO KILL ANY THAT MIGHT RESIST THE OFFICERS EMPLOYED TO COLLECT THEM
AND BY SHARING WITH OTHERS THE MONEY WHICH HARRY HAD SMUGGLED INTO HER POSSESSION AFTER SHE HAD STEADILY REFUSED TO TAKE ONE PENNY MORE THAN THE SUM AGREED UPON WHEN SHE FIRST WENT TO THEM
SHOWING THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT TO JUDGE OF ACTIONS MERELY BY THEIR EFFECTS FOR IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT WHAT HAS BEEN VERY MATURELY CONSIDERED IS ATTENDED WITH UNFAVORABLE RESULTS
ESTEEMED THEM THE LESS AND THEREFORE HAD THE LESS OCCASION TO GRIEVE FOR THEIR ABSENCE THE OTHER TAKING THEM FROM THOSE WHO BEING ACCUSTOMED TO THEIR POSSESSION
IT WOULD STILL BE BETTER TO WAIT AND LET HIM COMMENCE THE ATTACK THAN TO ASSAIL HIM FOR IN THE FORMER CASE THEY WOULD BE JUSTIFIED IN THE VIEW OF THE PRINCES OF ITALY AS WELL AS IN THEIR OWN
WERE ALLOWED TO BE MADE FOR THUS THE PALACE HAD BECOME FILLED WITH LOW MEN HE THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT THE ONLY MEANS OF REMEDYING THE EVIL WAS TO RESTORE THE GOVERNMENT TO THE NOBILITY
OR OTHERWISE FOR SOME OF THEM BELONGING TO THE COUNCIL OF TEN FORCES MIGHT BE LED INTO THE CITY WITHOUT EXCITING OBSERVATION RINALDO WAS MUCH APPLAUDED
BY THE PEOPLE OF FURLI TO OBEY THE WILL OF HER DECEASED HUSBAND
THE THOUGHT OF THAT INVESTMENT LAY WARM AT CHRISTIE'S HEART AND NEVER WOKE A REGRET FOR WELL SHE KNEW THAT EVERY DOLLAR OF IT WOULD BE BLESSED
MAY BE CONSTANTLY APPREHENDED HE SAID IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT THEIR RESOLUTION WOULD HAVE TWO EXCEEDINGLY PERNICIOUS EFFECTS THE ONE CONFERRING HONORS ON THOSE WHO HAVING NEVER POSSESSED THEM
POSTPONED ALL PERSONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND SENT AGNOLO DELLA PERGOLA WITH A STRONG FORCE AGAINST IMOLA
THE ELDEST SON OF MASO WHO BY HIS OWN TALENTS AND THE RESPECT HE DERIVED FROM THE MEMORY OF HIS FATHER ASPIRED TO THE FIRST OFFICES IN THE GOVERNMENT
ALL THAT RINALDO HAD ADVANCED WAS CORRECT AND THE REMEDIES HE PROPOSED GOOD AND CERTAIN IF THEY COULD BE ADOPTED WITHOUT AN ABSOLUTE DIVISION OF THE CITY AND THIS HE HAD NO DOUBT
BUT TO AGGRANDIZE THEIR OWN POWER WHICH GOD HAS VERY JUSTLY ABATED THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ENTERPRISE BY MANY A ONE WITH WHICH THEY HAVE OPPRESSED THE CITY
BOTH BY THE REDUCTION IN THEIR NUMBER AND BY INCREASING THE AUTHORITY OF THE GREAT WHO ON ACCOUNT OF FORMER ENMITIES WOULD BE DISINCLINED TO FAVOR THEM HE ADDED THAT IT IS A GOOD THING
BUT THAT IF HE DID NOT CONCUR WITH THEM THEY COULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT ARMS AND THAT WITH THEM THEY WOULD INCUR THE RISK OF BEING VANQUISHED OR OF NOT BEING ABLE TO REAP THE FRUIT OF VICTORY
DESCRIBING THE CONDITION OF THE CITY AND SHOWING HOW BY THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE IT HAD AGAIN FALLEN UNDER THE POWER OF THE PLEBEIANS FROM WHOM IT HAD BEEN WRESTED BY THEIR FATHERS IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
ON ENCOUNTERING THE ENEMY THEY WERE SOON ROUTED NOT SO MUCH BY THE BRAVERY OF THEIR ADVERSARIES AS BY THE SEVERITY OF THE SEASON FOR HAVING MARCHED MANY HOURS THROUGH DEEP MUD AND HEAVY RAIN
NEITHER OF THEM CHOOSING TO BE SUBJECT EITHER TO MAGISTRATES OR LAWS WHEN HOWEVER A GOOD WISE AND POWERFUL CITIZEN APPEARS WHICH IS BUT SELDOM
GIORGIO ORDELAFFI WAS LORD OF FURLI
AND DISTRACTING LEGS AND HAVING GAINED HER POINT MARRIED HIM WITH DRAMATIC CELERITY AND WENT WEST TO FOLLOW THE FORTUNES OF HER LORD THE OLD THEATRE WAS TO BE DEMOLISHED AND THE COMPANY SCATTERED
AS PATIENTLY AND AS GENTLY AS A LOVER MIGHT DETERMINED TO WIN HER CONFIDENCE BECAUSE ALL THE OTHERS HAD FAILED TO DO IT SOMETIMES SHE LEFT A FLOWER IN RACHEL'S BASKET ALWAYS SMILED AND NODDED AS SHE ENTERED
THAT NOW THE GREAT HAVING BEEN HUMBLED AND THE PLEBEIANS BECOME INSOLENT IT WAS WELL TO RESTRAIN THE INSOLENCE OF THE LATTER BY THE ASSISTANCE OF THE FORMER TO EFFECT THIS THEY MIGHT PROCEED EITHER OPENLY
AND WAGES WERE THE THREE TOPICS WHICH ABSORBED THEM CHRISTIE SOON TIRED OF THE INNUMERABLE CHANGES RUNG UPON THESE THEMES
AND HIS ADVICE WAS APPROVED OF BY THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY
AND PREPARE TO FRUSTRATE THE ENEMY'S DESIGNS AND IF HE WERE TO REMAIN QUIET IT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY TO GO TO WAR WITH HIM
IT WOULD THUS BE EVIDENT THAT THE INJURY DONE TO ONE PARTY
FINDING THE STRONG POSITION WHICH THE FLORENTINES HAD TAKEN PREVENTED HIM FROM RELIEVING FURLI DETERMINED TO ATTEMPT THE CAPTURE OF ZAGONARA THINKING THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT PLACE TO BE LOST
THE FIRST TO DO SO WAS GIOVANNI DI BICCI DE MEDICI WHO HAVING BECOME ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN AND BEING OF A HUMANE AND BENEVOLENT DISPOSITION
WITHOUT HEART OR CONSCIENCE PREYING ON THE BODIES AND THE SOULS OF THOSE WE LOVE BEST TO US FOR EVER ARE THE GATES OF HEAVEN SHUT FOR WHO SHALL OPEN THEM TO US AGAIN WE GO ON FOR ALL TIME ABHORRED BY ALL A BLOT ON THE FACE OF GOD'S SUNSHINE
I DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT IF YOU DON'T SEE HIM SOON HE WILL HAVE ONE OF HIS VIOLENT FITS
YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERSTAND MISSUS HARKER THAT WHEN A MAN IS SO LOVED AND HONOURED AS OUR HOST IS EVERYTHING REGARDING HIM IS OF INTEREST IN OUR LITTLE COMMUNITY
HAS VULGARISED THE TRUISM TO THE VERY POINT OF CONTEMPT ISN'T THAT TRUE DOCTOR I NODDED ASSENT FOR I WAS SO AMAZED THAT I HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO EITHER THINK OR SAY IT WAS HARD TO IMAGINE THAT I HAD SEEN HIM EAT UP HIS SPIDERS AND FLIES NOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE
STRENGTH BEING THE BEST SAFETY THROUGH CARE OF ME BUT THEIR MINDS WERE MADE UP AND THOUGH IT WAS A BITTER PILL FOR ME TO SWALLOW I COULD SAY NOTHING SAVE TO ACCEPT THEIR CHIVALROUS CARE OF ME MISTER MORRIS RESUMED THE DISCUSSION AS THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE
THOUGH NOW AND AGAIN WERE SCIONS WHO WERE HELD BY THEIR COEVALS TO HAVE HAD DEALINGS WITH THE EVIL ONE
THE MILK THAT IS SPILT CRIES NOT OUT AFTERWARDS AS YOU SAY WE SHALL NOT THINK OF THAT BUT GO ON OUR WAY TO THE END
BUT IT WAS LIFE TO ME TO FEEL ITS TOUCH SO STRONG SO SELF RELIANT SO RESOLUTE A BRAVE MAN'S HAND CAN SPEAK FOR ITSELF IT DOES NOT EVEN NEED A WOMAN'S LOVE TO HEAR ITS MUSIC WHEN THE PROFESSOR HAD DONE SPEAKING
AND AN END TO ACHIEVE WHICH IS NOT A SELFISH ONE THESE THINGS ARE MUCH NOW LET US SEE HOW FAR THE GENERAL POWERS ARRAYED AGAINST US ARE RESTRICT AND HOW THE INDIVIDUAL CANNOT IN FINE LET US CONSIDER THE LIMITATIONS OF THE VAMPIRE IN GENERAL
ARE WE NOT PLEDGED TO DESTROY THIS MONSTER
IT CAN BUT MAKE YOUR HUSBAND LOVE YOU THE MORE AND ALL US YOUR FRIENDS MORE HONOUR YOU AS WELL AS MORE ESTEEM AND LOVE SHE TOOK IT BACK WITH ANOTHER BLUSH AND A BRIGHT SMILE AND SO NOW UP TO THIS VERY HOUR ALL THE RECORDS WE HAVE ARE COMPLETE AND IN ORDER
UNDER AUSPICES PLEASANTER TO YOURSELF TO WHICH TO MY ASTONISHMENT HE REPLIED GOOD BYE MY DEAR I PRAY GOD I MAY NEVER SEE YOUR SWEET FACE AGAIN MAY HE BLESS AND KEEP YOU
AND HER SO FINE HUSBAND AND ARTHUR AND MY FRIEND QUINCEY THEY ARE WITH YOU TOO GOOD AS I DROVE TO THE HOUSE I TOLD HIM OF WHAT HAD PASSED AND OF HOW MY OWN DIARY HAD COME TO BE OF SOME USE THROUGH MISSUS HARKER'S SUGGESTION AT WHICH THE PROFESSOR INTERRUPTED ME
THE PROFESSOR READ IT OVER GRAVELY AND HANDED IT BACK SAYING IT NEED NOT GO IN IF YOU DO NOT WISH IT
ON THIS OCCASION MY EXPECTATION WAS NOT REALISED FOR WHEN HE FOUND THAT HIS APPEAL WOULD NOT BE SUCCESSFUL HE GOT INTO QUITE A FRANTIC CONDITION
NO MATTER HOW LOW IN THE SCALE OF CREATION ONE MIGHT INDEFINITELY PROLONG LIFE
I WANT TO SEE YOUR PATIENT MISTER RENFIELD DO LET ME SEE HIM WHAT YOU HAVE SAID OF HIM IN YOUR DIARY INTERESTS ME SO MUCH SHE LOOKED SO APPEALING AND SO PRETTY THAT I COULD NOT REFUSE HER AND THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE REASON WHY I SHOULD SO I TOOK HER WITH ME
ONLY AT CERTAIN TIMES CAN HE HAVE LIMITED FREEDOM IF HE BE NOT AT THE PLACE WHITHER HE IS BOUND HE CAN ONLY CHANGE HIMSELF AT NOON
WE KNOW FROM THE INQUIRY OF JONATHAN THAT FROM THE CASTLE TO WHITBY CAME FIFTY BOXES OF EARTH ALL OF WHICH WERE DELIVERED AT CARFAX WE ALSO KNOW
OR IN ANY WAY DUE TO HER UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCE SHE MUST HAVE SOME RARE GIFT OR POWER WE CONTINUED TO TALK FOR SOME TIME AND SEEING THAT HE WAS SEEMINGLY QUITE REASONABLE SHE VENTURED
AS IF A WOMAN CAN SLEEP WHEN THOSE SHE LOVES ARE IN DANGER I SHALL LIE DOWN AND PRETEND TO SLEEP LEST JONATHAN HAVE ADDED ANXIETY ABOUT ME WHEN HE RETURNS DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY
OR WAS JEALOUS OF SOME INTERFERENCE
MY FEARS HOWEVER WERE GROUNDLESS FOR HE HELD UP HIS TWO HANDS IMPLORINGLY
AN ARROW IN THE SIDE OF HIM WHO DIED FOR MAN BUT WE ARE FACE TO FACE WITH DUTY
I THINK WE WERE ALL STAGGERED FOR MY OWN PART I WAS UNDER THE CONVICTION DESPITE MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAN'S CHARACTER AND HISTORY THAT HIS REASON HAD BEEN RESTORED
SO AS WE ALL TOOK HANDS OUR SOLEMN COMPACT WAS MADE I FELT MY HEART ICY COLD
HE IS ONLY STRONGER AND BEING STRONGER HAVE YET MORE POWER TO WORK EVIL
DOCTOR VAN HELSING WILL YOU READ THIS AND TELL ME IF IT MUST GO IN IT IS MY RECORD OF TO DAY I TOO HAVE SEEN THE NEED OF PUTTING DOWN AT PRESENT EVERYTHING HOWEVER TRIVIAL BUT THERE IS LITTLE IN THIS EXCEPT WHAT IS PERSONAL MUST IT GO IN
HE SAW ME AT ONCE AND RUSHED UP TO ME SAYING AH FRIEND JOHN HOW GOES ALL WELL SO I HAVE BEEN BUSY FOR I COME HERE TO STAY IF NEED BE ALL AFFAIRS ARE SETTLED WITH ME AND I HAVE MUCH TO TELL MADAM MINA IS WITH YOU YES
HE SAID CHEERFULLY LET THE LADY COME IN AND SAT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED WITH HIS HEAD DOWN
WHY WE KNOW NOT HE MAY NOT ENTER ANYWHERE AT THE FIRST UNLESS THERE BE SOME ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHO BID HIM TO COME THOUGH AFTERWARDS HE CAN COME AS HE PLEASE HIS POWER CEASES AS DOES THAT OF ALL EVIL THINGS AT THE COMING OF THE DAY
COME OUT FROM ANYTHING OR INTO ANYTHING NO MATTER HOW CLOSE IT BE BOUND OR EVEN FUSED UP WITH FIRE SOLDER YOU CALL IT HE CAN SEE IN THE DARK NO SMALL POWER THIS IN A WORLD WHICH IS ONE HALF SHUT FROM THE LIGHT AH
AND ALL THE DEAD THAT HE CAN COME NIGH TO ARE FOR HIM AT COMMAND HE IS BRUTE AND MORE THAN BRUTE
AND WOULD SEE ABOUT THE NECESSARY FORMALITIES FOR HIS RELEASE IN THE MORNING I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO WAIT HOWEVER BEFORE MAKING SO GRAVE A STATEMENT FOR OF OLD I KNEW THE SUDDEN CHANGES TO WHICH THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT WAS LIABLE SO I CONTENTED MYSELF WITH MAKING A GENERAL STATEMENT
AND ESPECIAL WHEN HIS MIND IS DISTURBED
SO FAR FROM US IN ALL WAYS THERE EVEN IS HE AND THE PEOPLES FEAR HIM AT THIS DAY HE HAVE FOLLOW THE WAKE OF THE BERSERKER ICELANDER THE DEVIL BEGOTTEN HUN THE SLAV THE SAXON THE MAGYAR SO FAR THEN
BUT EVEN BY HIS PATIENTS WHO BEING SOME OF THEM HARDLY IN MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM
WHICH WE ALL UNDERSTAND TOO WELL THERE HAVE BEEN FROM THE LOINS OF THIS VERY ONE GREAT MEN AND GOOD WOMEN AND THEIR GRAVES MAKE SACRED THE EARTH WHERE ALONE THIS FOULNESS CAN DWELL
BUT THE FACT IS THAT WHILST THE PROFESSOR WAS TALKING THERE CAME A BIG BAT AND SAT ON THE WINDOW SILL I HAVE GOT SUCH A HORROR OF THE DAMNED BRUTES FROM RECENT EVENTS THAT I CANNOT STAND THEM AND I WENT OUT TO HAVE A SHOT
INDEED IT WAS NO WONDER THAT MY FRIENDS WERE ALARMED AND INSISTED ON MY BEING PUT UNDER CONTROL I USED TO FANCY THAT LIFE WAS A POSITIVE AND PERPETUAL ENTITY
HE CAN FLOURISH WHEN THAT HE CAN FATTEN ON THE BLOOD OF THE LIVING EVEN MORE
OH NO I HAVE A HUSBAND OF MY OWN
WITCH ORDOG AND POKOL' SATAN AND HELL AND IN ONE MANUSCRIPT THIS VERY DRACULA IS SPOKEN OF AS
EVEN IF SHE BE NOT HARMED HER HEART MAY FAIL HER IN SO MUCH AND SO MANY HORRORS AND HEREAFTER SHE MAY SUFFER
WE HAVE TOLD OUR SECRETS AND YET NO ONE WHO HAS TOLD IS THE WORSE FOR IT MISSUS HARKER BEGAN TO BLUSH
NAY HAD I EVEN GUESS AT HIM ONE SO PRECIOUS LIFE HAD BEEN SPARED TO MANY OF US WHO DID LOVE HER BUT THAT IS GONE AND WE MUST SO WORK THAT OTHER POOR SOULS PERISH NOT WHILST WE CAN SAVE THE NOSFERATU DO NOT DIE LIKE THE BEE WHEN HE STING ONCE
AS AGAIN JONATHAN SAW THOSE SISTERS IN THE CASTLE OF DRACULA HE BECOME SO SMALL WE OURSELVES SAW MISS LUCY ERE SHE WAS AT PEACE SLIP THROUGH A HAIRBREADTH SPACE AT THE TOMB DOOR HE CAN WHEN ONCE HE FIND HIS WAY
SINCE I MYSELF HAVE BEEN AN INMATE OF A LUNATIC ASYLUM I CANNOT BUT NOTICE THAT THE SOPHISTIC TENDENCIES OF SOME OF ITS INMATES LEAN TOWARDS THE ERRORS OF NON CAUSA AND IGNORATIO ELENCHI I POSITIVELY OPENED MY EYES AT THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT
AND I TOOK CARE TO STAND WHERE I COULD SEIZE HIM AT ONCE IF HE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A SPRING AT HER SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM WITH AN EASY GRACEFULNESS WHICH WOULD AT ONCE COMMAND THE RESPECT OF ANY LUNATIC FOR EASINESS IS ONE OF THE QUALITIES MAD PEOPLE MOST RESPECT
TO KNOW IF I WOULD SEE HIM AT ONCE AS HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO SAY TO ME I TOLD THE MESSENGER TO SAY THAT I WOULD ATTEND TO HIS WISHES IN THE MORNING I WAS BUSY JUST AT THE MOMENT THE ATTENDANT ADDED HE SEEMS VERY IMPORTUNATE SIR I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM SO EAGER
AND LIFE WITH HIS SUNSHINE HIS FAIR PLACES
AGAIN HE LOOKED AT US ALL KEENLY I HAD A GROWING CONVICTION THAT THIS SUDDEN CHANGE OF HIS ENTIRE INTELLECTUAL METHOD
TO THEM HE IS NOTHING BUT IN THEIR PRESENCE HE TAKE HIS PLACE FAR OFF AND SILENT WITH RESPECT THERE ARE OTHERS TOO WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU OF LEST IN OUR SEEKING WE MAY NEED THEM THE BRANCH OF WILD ROSE ON HIS COFFIN KEEP HIM
DID YOU HIT IT ASKED DOCTOR VAN HELSING I DON'T KNOW I FANCY NOT FOR IT FLEW AWAY INTO THE WOOD WITHOUT SAYING ANY MORE HE TOOK HIS SEAT AND THE PROFESSOR
HIS REPLY WAS SIMPLY CONTEMPTUOUS GIVEN IN A PAUSE IN WHICH HE TURNED HIS EYES FROM MISSUS HARKER TO ME INSTANTLY TURNING THEM BACK AGAIN WHAT AN ASININE QUESTION I DON'T SEE THAT AT ALL MISTER RENFIELD SAID MISSUS HARKER AT ONCE CHAMPIONING ME
AND CAN TAKE OUR MEASURE ACCORDING THERE ARE SUCH BEINGS AS VAMPIRES SOME OF US HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THEY EXIST EVEN HAD WE NOT THE PROOF OF OUR OWN UNHAPPY EXPERIENCE THE TEACHINGS AND THE RECORDS OF THE PAST GIVE PROOF ENOUGH FOR SANE PEOPLES I ADMIT
HE SAID TO MISSUS HARKER I AM TOLD MADAM MINA BY MY FRIEND JOHN THAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND HAVE PUT UP IN EXACT ORDER ALL THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN UP TO THIS MOMENT NOT UP TO THIS MOMENT PROFESSOR SHE SAID IMPULSIVELY BUT UP TO THIS MORNING BUT WHY NOT UP TO NOW
AT OTHER TIME HE CAN ONLY CHANGE WHEN THE TIME COME IT IS SAID TOO THAT HE CAN ONLY PASS RUNNING WATER AT THE SLACK OR THE FLOOD OF THE TIDE THEN THERE ARE THINGS WHICH SO AFFLICT HIM THAT HE HAS NO POWER AS THE GARLIC THAT WE KNOW OF AND AS FOR THINGS SACRED AS THIS SYMBOL MY CRUCIFIX
OH VERY WELL HE SAID LET HER COME IN BY ALL MEANS BUT JUST WAIT A MINUTE TILL I TIDY UP THE PLACE HIS METHOD OF TIDYING WAS PECULIAR HE SIMPLY SWALLOWED ALL THE FLIES AND SPIDERS IN THE BOXES BEFORE I COULD STOP HIM IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT HE FEARED
WHICH IS AS HIS ETYMOLOGY IMPLY
THAT HE APPEARED TO BE IMPROVING VERY RAPIDLY THAT I WOULD HAVE A LONGER CHAT WITH HIM IN THE MORNING
WHAT SAY YOU WHILST HE WAS SPEAKING JONATHAN HAD TAKEN MY HAND I FEARED OH SO MUCH THAT THE APPALLING NATURE OF OUR DANGER WAS OVERCOMING HIM
WE HAVE ALL WE MAY ACT UPON AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT VERY MUCH OF THE BELIEFS ARE JUSTIFIED BY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR OWN SO UNHAPPY EXPERIENCE THE VAMPIRE LIVE ON AND CANNOT DIE BY MERE PASSING OF THE TIME
ALL WE HAVE TO GO UPON ARE TRADITIONS AND SUPERSTITIONS THESE DO NOT AT THE FIRST APPEAR MUCH WHEN THE MATTER IS ONE OF LIFE AND DEATH
AS WELL AS THE BRAVEST OF THE SONS OF THE LAND BEYOND THE FOREST THAT MIGHTY BRAIN AND THAT IRON RESOLUTION WENT WITH HIM TO HIS GRAVE AND ARE EVEN NOW ARRAYED AGAINST US THE DRACULAS WERE SAYS ARMINIUS A GREAT AND NOBLE RACE
BUT ONLY WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AFTERWARDS FOR IT WAS AS OF ONE ADDRESSING AN EQUAL CAN YOU NOT TELL FRANKLY YOUR REAL REASON FOR WISHING TO BE FREE TO NIGHT I WILL UNDERTAKE THAT IF YOU WILL SATISFY EVEN ME A STRANGER WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND WITH THE HABIT OF KEEPING AN OPEN MIND DOCTOR SEWARD WILL GIVE YOU
I VOTE WE HAVE A LOOK AT HIS HOUSE RIGHT NOW TIME IS EVERYTHING WITH HIM AND SWIFT ACTION ON OUR PART MAY SAVE ANOTHER VICTIM I OWN THAT MY HEART BEGAN TO FAIL ME WHEN THE TIME FOR ACTION CAME SO CLOSE BUT I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING
HUMANITARIAN AND MEDICO JURIST AS WELL AS SCIENTIST WILL DEEM IT A MORAL DUTY TO DEAL WITH ME AS ONE TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNDER EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES HE MADE THIS LAST APPEAL WITH A COURTLY AIR OF CONVICTION WHICH WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS OWN CHARM
YET MUST WE BE SATISFIED IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE NO OTHER MEANS IS AT OUR CONTROL AND SECONDLY BECAUSE AFTER ALL THESE THINGS TRADITION AND SUPERSTITION
JUST AS I HAD EXPECTED WHEN I WAS LEAVING THE ROOM LAST OF OUR PARTY HE SAID TO ME IN A QUIET WELL BRED VOICE
WHICH HAD BEEN AT SIX O'CLOCK WE UNCONSCIOUSLY FORMED A SORT OF BOARD OR COMMITTEE PROFESSOR VAN HELSING TOOK THE HEAD OF THE TABLE TO WHICH DOCTOR SEWARD MOTIONED HIM AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM HE MADE ME SIT NEXT TO HIM ON HIS RIGHT AND ASKED ME TO ACT AS SECRETARY JONATHAN SAT NEXT TO ME
WHEN HE MADE THAT SO GOOD COMBINATION FRIEND JOHN UP TO NOW FORTUNE HAS MADE THAT WOMAN OF HELP TO US AFTER TO NIGHT SHE MUST NOT HAVE TO DO WITH THIS SO TERRIBLE AFFAIR IT IS NOT GOOD THAT SHE RUN A RISK SO GREAT WE MEN ARE DETERMINED NAY
I APPEAL TO YOUR FRIENDS HE SAID THEY WILL PERHAPS NOT MIND SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON MY CASE BY THE WAY YOU HAVE NOT INTRODUCED ME I WAS SO MUCH ASTONISHED THAT THE ODDNESS OF INTRODUCING A MADMAN IN AN ASYLUM DID NOT STRIKE ME AT THE MOMENT AND BESIDES
HE CAN TRANSFORM HIMSELF TO WOLF AS WE GATHER FROM THE SHIP ARRIVAL IN WHITBY WHEN HE TEAR OPEN THE DOG
WHICH YOU YOURSELF PUT UPON US BE WISE AND HELP US AND IF WE CAN WE SHALL AID YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR WISH HE STILL SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE SAID DOCTOR VAN HELSING I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY YOUR ARGUMENT IS COMPLETE AND IF I WERE FREE TO SPEAK I SHOULD NOT HESITATE A MOMENT
FOR HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE QUESTION WITH THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE COMPLETEST SANITY HE EVEN TOOK HIMSELF AS AN EXAMPLE WHEN HE MENTIONED CERTAIN THINGS WHY I MYSELF AM AN INSTANCE OF A MAN WHO HAD A STRANGE BELIEF
OH HEAR ME HEAR ME LET ME GO LET ME GO LET ME GO I THOUGHT THAT THE LONGER THIS WENT ON THE WILDER HE WOULD GET AND SO WOULD BRING ON A FIT
WE EVEN SCOUTED A BELIEF THAT WE SAW JUSTIFIED UNDER OUR VERY EYES TAKE IT THEN THAT THE VAMPIRE
THAT HIS VITAL FACULTIES GROW STRENUOUS AND SEEM AS THOUGH THEY REFRESH THEMSELVES WHEN HIS SPECIAL PABULUM IS PLENTY BUT HE CANNOT FLOURISH WITHOUT THIS DIET HE EAT NOT AS OTHERS EVEN FRIEND JONATHAN WHO LIVED WITH HIM FOR WEEKS
HE BECAME STILL MORE DEMONSTRATIVE I GLANCED AT VAN HELSING AND SAW MY CONVICTION REFLECTED IN HIS EYES
AND TRY TO BEHAVE MORE DISCREETLY HE SUDDENLY STOPPED AND LOOKED AT ME INTENTLY FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS THEN WITHOUT A WORD HE ROSE AND MOVING OVER SAT DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE BED THE COLLAPSE HAD COME
AND FROM ALL THE MEANS THAT ARE HE TELL ME OF WHAT HE HAS BEEN
NEVER HE THROWS NO SHADOW HE MAKE IN THE MIRROR NO REFLECT AS AGAIN JONATHAN OBSERVE HE HAS THE STRENGTH OF MANY OF HIS HAND WITNESS AGAIN JONATHAN WHEN HE SHUT THE DOOR AGAINST THE WOLFS AND WHEN HE HELP HIM FROM THE DILIGENCE TOO
THE PRIVILEGE YOU SEEK HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY AND WITH A LOOK OF POIGNANT REGRET ON HIS FACE THE PROFESSOR WENT ON COME SIR BETHINK YOURSELF YOU CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE OF REASON IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE
I AM CONTENT TO IMPLORE IN SUCH A CASE NOT ON PERSONAL GROUNDS
A POWER DENIED TO THE VAMPIRE KIND WE HAVE SOURCES OF SCIENCE WE ARE FREE TO ACT AND THINK AND THE HOURS OF THE DAY AND THE NIGHT ARE OURS EQUALLY IN FACT SO FAR AS OUR POWERS EXTEND THEY ARE UNFETTERED AND WE ARE FREE TO USE THEM WE HAVE SELF DEVOTION IN A CAUSE
MISTER MORRIS WAS LOOKING STEADILY AT THE WINDOW AND HE NOW GOT UP QUIETLY AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE AND THEN THE PROFESSOR WENT ON AND NOW WE MUST SETTLE WHAT WE DO WE HAVE HERE MUCH DATA AND WE MUST PROCEED TO LAY OUT OUR CAMPAIGN
AND SO DETERMINED TO LET HIM GO ON A LITTLE LONGER KNOWING FROM EXPERIENCE THAT HE WOULD LIKE ALL LUNATICS GIVE HIMSELF AWAY IN THE END VAN HELSING WAS GAZING AT HIM WITH A LOOK OF UTMOST INTENSITY HIS BUSHY EYEBROWS ALMOST MEETING WITH THE FIXED CONCENTRATION OF HIS LOOK
HERE WAS MY OWN PET LUNATIC THE MOST PRONOUNCED OF HIS TYPE THAT I HAD EVER MET WITH TALKING ELEMENTAL PHILOSOPHY AND WITH THE MANNER OF A POLISHED GENTLEMAN I WONDER IF IT WAS MISSUS HARKER'S PRESENCE WHICH HAD TOUCHED SOME CHORD IN HIS MEMORY IF THIS NEW PHASE WAS SPONTANEOUS
I LEFT THE BOYS BEHIND ME POOR ART SEEMED MORE CHEERFUL THAN HE HAS BEEN SINCE LUCY FIRST TOOK ILL AND QUINCEY IS MORE LIKE HIS OWN BRIGHT SELF THAN HE HAS BEEN FOR MANY A LONG DAY
COME I SAID STERNLY NO MORE OF THIS WE HAVE HAD QUITE ENOUGH ALREADY
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT OUR FIRST STEP SHOULD BE TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER ALL THE REST REMAIN IN THE HOUSE BEYOND THAT WALL WHERE WE LOOK TO DAY OR WHETHER ANY MORE HAVE BEEN REMOVED IF THE LATTER WE MUST TRACE HERE
AND IN SLEEP FROM HER DREAMS AND BESIDES SHE IS YOUNG WOMAN AND NOT SO LONG MARRIED THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS TO THINK OF SOME TIME IF NOT NOW YOU TELL ME SHE HAS WROTE ALL THEN SHE MUST CONSULT WITH US
THAT THE HOUSE WHICH DRACULA HAD BOUGHT WAS THE VERY NEXT ONE TO MY OWN HE WAS AMAZED AND A GREAT CONCERN SEEMED TO COME ON HIM OH THAT WE HAD KNOWN IT BEFORE HE SAID FOR THEN WE MIGHT HAVE REACHED HIM IN TIME TO SAVE POOR LUCY HOWEVER
THAT AT THE FIRST I WAS SCEPTIC WERE IT NOT THAT THROUGH LONG YEARS I HAVE TRAIN MYSELF TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THAT FACT THUNDER ON MY EAR SEE SEE I PROVE I PROVE ALAS
AMONGST THE MOUNTAINS OVER LAKE HERMANSTADT WHERE THE DEVIL CLAIMS THE TENTH SCHOLAR AS HIS DUE IN THE RECORDS ARE SUCH WORDS AS
OH LET ME IMPLORE YOU TO LET ME OUT OF THIS HOUSE AT ONCE SEND ME AWAY HOW YOU WILL AND WHERE YOU WILL SEND KEEPERS WITH ME WITH WHIPS AND CHAINS
AND WE GO ALONE I AGREED HEARTILY WITH HIM
THE PROFESSOR TOOK AWAY ONE COPY TO STUDY AFTER DINNER AND BEFORE OUR MEETING WHICH IS FIXED FOR NINE O'CLOCK THE REST OF US HAVE ALREADY READ EVERYTHING SO WHEN WE MEET IN THE STUDY WE SHALL ALL BE INFORMED AS TO FACTS AND CAN ARRANGE OUR PLAN OF BATTLE
THE DOCTOR HERE WILL BEAR ME OUT THAT ON ONE OCCASION I TRIED TO KILL HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF STRENGTHENING MY VITAL POWERS BY THE ASSIMILATION WITH MY OWN BODY OF HIS LIFE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF HIS BLOOD RELYING OF COURSE UPON THE SCRIPTURAL PHRASE FOR THE BLOOD IS THE LIFE THOUGH INDEED THE VENDOR OF A CERTAIN NOSTRUM
HE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS YET HE IS NOT FREE NAY HE IS EVEN MORE PRISONER THAN THE SLAVE OF THE GALLEY THAN THE MADMAN IN HIS CELL HE CANNOT GO WHERE HE LISTS HE WHO IS NOT OF NATURE
I AM SURE IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO PUT BEFORE SO ADMIRABLE A PRACTITIONER
HE CAN COME IN MIST WHICH HE CREATE THAT NOBLE SHIP'S CAPTAIN PROVED HIM OF THIS BUT FROM WHAT WE KNOW THE DISTANCE HE CAN MAKE THIS MIST IS LIMITED AND IT CAN ONLY BE ROUND HIMSELF HE COME ON MOONLIGHT RAYS AS ELEMENTAL DUST
YET SO MOMENTOUS A WISH TO ENSURE ITS FULFILMENT HE LOOKED AT ME KEENLY AND SEEING THE NEGATIVE IN MY FACE TURNED TO THE OTHERS AND SCRUTINISED THEM CLOSELY NOT MEETING ANY SUFFICIENT RESPONSE HE WENT ON
THAT YOU HARDLY APPREHEND MY WISH I DESIRE TO GO AT ONCE HERE NOW THIS VERY HOUR THIS VERY MOMENT IF I MAY TIME PRESSES
YOU DON'T KNOW WHOM YOU WRONG OR HOW AND I MAY NOT TELL WOE IS ME I MAY NOT TELL BY ALL YOU HOLD SACRED BY ALL YOU HOLD DEAR BY YOUR LOVE THAT IS LOST BY YOUR HOPE THAT LIVES
THUS WHEN WE FIND THE HABITATION OF THIS MAN THAT WAS WE CAN CONFINE HIM TO HIS COFFIN AND DESTROY HIM IF WE OBEY WHAT WE KNOW BUT HE IS CLEVER I HAVE ASKED MY FRIEND ARMINIUS OF BUDA PESTH UNIVERSITY TO MAKE HIS RECORD
SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS WHEN HE WANTED A CAT
HE MUST SURELY WIN AND THEN WHERE END WE LIFE IS NOTHINGS I HEED HIM NOT BUT TO FAIL HERE IS NOT MERE LIFE OR DEATH IT IS THAT WE BECOME AS HIM THAT WE HENCEFORWARD BECOME FOUL THINGS OF THE NIGHT LIKE HIM
AS AT LEAST THE MAJORITY OF MEN WHO ARE IN FULL POSSESSION OF THEIR LIBERTIES
WE WERE INTERRUPTED IN A VERY STARTLING WAY OUTSIDE THE HOUSE CAME THE SOUND OF A PISTOL SHOT THE GLASS OF THE WINDOW WAS SHATTERED WITH A BULLET WHICH RICOCHETTING FROM THE TOP OF THE EMBRASURE STRUCK THE FAR WALL OF THE ROOM I AM AFRAID I AM AT HEART A COWARD FOR I SHRIEKED OUT
I THOUGHT IT WAS NOW TIME TO END THE SCENE WHICH WAS BECOMING TOO COMICALLY GRAVE SO I WENT TOWARDS THE DOOR SIMPLY SAYING COME MY FRIENDS WE HAVE WORK TO DO GOOD NIGHT AS HOWEVER I GOT NEAR THE DOOR A NEW CHANGE CAME OVER THE PATIENT
BUT NONE OF THE OTHERS AT FIRST SAID ANYTHING HIS REQUEST WAS THAT I WOULD AT ONCE RELEASE HIM FROM THE ASYLUM AND SEND HIM HOME THIS HE BACKED UP WITH ARGUMENTS REGARDING HIS COMPLETE RECOVERY
IF NOT MORE STERN AND MOTIONED TO HIM THAT HIS EFFORTS WERE UNAVAILING I HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEN SOMETHING OF THE SAME CONSTANTLY GROWING EXCITEMENT IN HIM WHEN HE HAD TO MAKE SOME REQUEST OF WHICH AT THE TIME
HIS MUSIC AND HIS LOVE LIE FAR BEHIND YOU OTHERS ARE YOUNG SOME HAVE SEEN SORROW
MISTER MORRIS YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOUR GREAT STATE ITS RECEPTION INTO THE UNION WAS A PRECEDENT WHICH MAY HAVE FAR REACHING EFFECTS HEREAFTER WHEN THE POLE AND THE TROPICS MAY HOLD ALLIANCE TO THE STARS AND STRIPES THE POWER OF TREATY MAY YET PROVE A VAST ENGINE OF ENLARGEMENT
AND HELD UP HIS HANDS WRINGING THEM IN PLAINTIVE SUPPLICATION AND POURED FORTH A TORRENT OF ENTREATY
ALL RIGHT I'LL GO NOW AND I ASKED THE OTHERS TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES FOR ME AS I HAD TO GO AND SEE MY PATIENT TAKE ME WITH YOU FRIEND JOHN SAID THE PROFESSOR HIS CASE IN YOUR DIARY INTEREST ME MUCH AND IT HAD BEARING TOO NOW AND AGAIN ON OUR CASE
THERE WAS A CERTAIN DIGNITY IN THE MAN'S MANNER SO MUCH OF THE HABIT OF EQUALITY THAT I AT ONCE MADE THE INTRODUCTION LORD GODALMING PROFESSOR VAN HELSING MISTER QUINCEY MORRIS OF TEXAS
WE HAVE PROOF BY INFERENCE THUS WHEREAS HE CAN DO AS HE WILL WITHIN HIS LIMIT WHEN HE HAVE HIS EARTH HOME HIS COFFIN HOME HIS HELL HOME THE PLACE UNHALLOWED AS WE SAW WHEN HE WENT TO THE GRAVE OF THE SUICIDE AT WHITBY STILL
OR HE ME I AM MISSUS HARKER
OPPOSITE US WERE LORD GODALMING DOCTOR SEWARD AND MISTER MORRIS LORD GODALMING BEING NEXT THE PROFESSOR AND DOCTOR SEWARD IN THE CENTRE THE PROFESSOR SAID I MAY I SUPPOSE TAKE IT THAT WE ARE ALL ACQUAINTED WITH THE FACTS THAT ARE IN THESE PAPERS
AND UNSELFISH AND SPRING FROM THE HIGHEST SENSE OF DUTY COULD YOU LOOK SIR INTO MY HEART YOU WOULD APPROVE TO THE FULL THE SENTIMENTS WHICH ANIMATE ME NAY MORE YOU WOULD COUNT ME AMONGST THE BEST AND TRUEST OF YOUR FRIENDS
AH THAT WONDERFUL MADAM MINA
WHEN I WENT INTO THE ROOM I TOLD THE MAN THAT A LADY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM TO WHICH HE SIMPLY ANSWERED WHY SHE IS GOING THROUGH THE HOUSE
FOR THE SAKE OF THE ALMIGHTY TAKE ME OUT OF THIS AND SAVE MY SOUL FROM GUILT CAN'T YOU HEAR ME MAN CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND WILL YOU NEVER LEARN DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I AM SANE AND EARNEST NOW THAT I AM NO LUNATIC IN A MAD FIT BUT A SANE MAN FIGHTING FOR HIS SOUL
SHE WALKED OVER TO HIM SMILING PLEASANTLY AND HELD OUT HER HAND GOOD EVENING MISTER RENFIELD SAID SHE YOU SEE I KNOW YOU FOR DOCTOR SEWARD HAS TOLD ME OF YOU HE MADE NO IMMEDIATE REPLY BUT EYED HER ALL OVER INTENTLY WITH A SET FROWN ON HIS FACE
YOU HAVE I SAID FRANKLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS I FELT BRUTALLY THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE AND THEN HE SAID SLOWLY THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST ONLY SHIFT MY GROUND OF REQUEST LET ME ASK FOR THIS CONCESSION BOON
WHO WON HIS NAME AGAINST THE TURK OVER THE GREAT RIVER ON THE VERY FRONTIER OF TURKEY LAND IF IT BE SO THEN WAS HE NO COMMON MAN FOR IN THAT TIME AND FOR CENTURIES AFTER HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE CLEVEREST AND THE MOST CUNNING
AS MADAM MINA SAW HIM ON THE WINDOW AT WHITBY AND AS FRIEND JOHN SAW HIM FLY FROM THIS SO NEAR HOUSE AND AS MY FRIEND QUINCEY SAW HIM
YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO CONTEND AGAINST BUT WE TOO ARE NOT WITHOUT STRENGTH
WITH THIS TERRIBLE AND MYSTERIOUS ENEMY MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL THIRTY SEPTEMBER
A SACRED BULLET FIRED INTO THE COFFIN KILL HIM SO THAT HE BE TRUE DEAD AND AS FOR THE STAKE THROUGH HIM WE KNOW ALREADY OF ITS PEACE OR THE CUT OFF HEAD THAT GIVETH REST WE HAVE SEEN IT
YOU GENTLEMEN WHO BY NATIONALITY BY HEREDITY
A BRAIN THAT A MAN SHOULD HAVE WERE HE MUCH GIFTED AND A WOMAN'S HEART
THAT THIS EVIL THING IS ROOTED DEEP IN ALL GOOD IN SOIL BARREN OF HOLY MEMORIES IT CANNOT REST
FOR I HAD A GREATER FEAR THAT IF I APPEARED AS A DRAG OR A HINDRANCE TO THEIR WORK THEY MIGHT EVEN LEAVE ME OUT OF THEIR COUNSELS ALTOGETHER THEY HAVE NOW GONE OFF TO CARFAX WITH MEANS TO GET INTO THE HOUSE MANLIKE THEY HAD TOLD ME TO GO TO BED AND SLEEP
THE MEN ALL JUMPED TO THEIR FEET LORD GODALMING FLEW OVER TO THE WINDOW AND THREW UP THE SASH AS HE DID SO WE HEARD MISTER MORRIS'S VOICE WITHOUT SORRY
SINCE YOU SEEK TO IMPRESS US WITH YOUR COMPLETE REASONABLENESS YOU DO THIS WHOSE SANITY WE HAVE REASON TO DOUBT
SIR I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR DROPPING ALL FORMS OF CONVENTIONAL PREFIX WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL HAS REVOLUTIONISED THERAPEUTICS BY HIS DISCOVERY OF THE CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION OF BRAIN MATTER CONVENTIONAL FORMS ARE UNFITTING SINCE THEY WOULD SEEM TO LIMIT HIM TO ONE OF A CLASS
WE ALL EXPRESSED ASSENT AND HE WENT ON THEN IT WERE I THINK GOOD THAT I TELL YOU SOMETHING OF THE KIND OF ENEMY WITH WHICH WE HAVE TO DEAL I SHALL THEN MAKE KNOWN TO YOU SOMETHING OF THE HISTORY OF THIS MAN WHICH HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED FOR ME
CLAIRE TOOK THE ENVELOPE FROM HIM EXTRACTED THE LETTER AND HANDED BACK THE ENVELOPE PERCY VANISHED INTO THE DINING ROOM WITH A SHATTERING SQUEAL OF PLEASURE A VOICE SPOKE FROM BEHIND A HALF OPENED DOOR
BUT FOR THE CERTAINTY THAT UGLY PERSONS ARE JUST AS IRRATIONAL IN THE MATTER OF UNDIVIDED LOVE AS THE BEAUTIFUL IT SEEMS THAT POLYGAMY WAS A BLESSED INSTITUTION FOR THE WOMEN AND THAT ONLY THE DREAD THREATS OF THE SPIRITUAL POWER
AND WE WAS VERY POOR NOW WE'RE BETTER OFF MY FATHER AN MOTHER AN ME THEN YOU LIKE THE STATE SHE MISUNDERSTOOD AT FIRST OH I AIN'T LIVIN IN THE STATE OF POLYGAMY NOT ME YET I AIN'T MARRIED I LIKE WHERE I AM
UNLESS YOU TIP THE HEAD WAITER A SMALL FORTUNE AND PROMISE TO MAIL HIM YOUR CLOTHES WHEN YOU GET HOME I DANCE DURING SUPPER WITH NOTHING ON MY FEET AND NOT MUCH ANYWHERE ELSE AND IT TAKES THREE VANS TO CARRY MY SALARY TO THE BANK
THIRD BATTALION SKELETON FOURTH ON PAPER EIGHT REGIMENTS CAVALRY AT FOUR BATTALIONS FOUR TROOPS EACH THIRD BATTALION SKELETON FOURTH ON PAPER FIVE REGIMENTS ARTILLERY AT FOUR BATTALIONS FOUR COMPANIES EACH THIRD BATTALION SKELETON FOURTH ON PAPER
HE KNEADED THE RECUMBENT FORM OF HIS GODSON WITH A LARGE HAND UNTIL HE HAD MASSAGED OUT OF HIM THE LAST REMAINS OF HIS GREAT SLEEP IT TOOK SOME TIME BUT IT WAS EFFECTIVE THE WHITE HOPE SAT UP FULL OF LIFE AND ENERGY
DARLING CLAIRE DO COME OR I KNOW I SHALL WEAKEN AND YIELD TO ALGIE'S OUTRAGEOUS DEMANDS FOR
I'VE GOT THINGS O MY OWN AND SOME LAND BUT I SUPPOSE YOU WILL NOT ME
WOULD BE CAPABLE OF HEAVING A SHOVELFUL OF MUD INTO THE ATLANTIC IN THE HOPE OF FILLING IT UP CONSEQUENTLY THE AUTHORITIES ARE FASCINATED WITH THE IDEA OF THE SLIDING SCALE OR CONCERTINA ARMY THIS IS AN HEREDITARY INSTINCT FOR YOU KNOW THAT WHEN WE ENGLISH HAVE GOT TOGETHER TWO COMPANIES ONE MACHINE GUN A SICK BULLOCK
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT ALGIE WALKED STRAIGHT OUT OF THE HOUSE STILL HOLDING THE TEASPOON AND HAS NOT RETURNED LATER IN THE DAY HE CALLED ME UP ON THE PHONE AND SAID THAT
JIM SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD TO ME ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS THIS ONE FOR THE LORD'S SAKE
HIS EARNEST CONCENTRATION ON THE MAIN PLANK OF HIS PLATFORM THE SPIRITING AWAY OF WILLIAM BANNISTER HAD CAUSED HIM TO OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT NO PREPARATIONS HAD BEEN MADE TO WELCOME HIM ON HIS ARRIVAL AT HIS DESTINATION
AND IN THE TABERNACLE ON A SUNDAY THE PREACHERS FOLLOW SUIT WHEN I WENT THERE
OF ALL THE THINGS WHICH WOULD HAVE CHIMED IN WITH HER DISCONTENTED MOOD AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN FLIGHT TO AMERICA WAS THE MOST ALLURING ONLY ONE CONSIDERATION HELD HER BACK SHE HAD NOT THE MONEY FOR HER FARE
THERE'S THAT TOM WHITING BUT HE'S A BAD BOY HE AIN'T BEEN RAISED RIGHT WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM
WHAT I AM REALLY WRITING ABOUT IS TO TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE GOT TO COME OVER HERE I'VE TAKEN A HOUSE AT BROOKPORT ON LONG ISLAND FOR THE SUMMER YOU CAN STAY WITH ME TILL THE FALL AND THEN I CAN EASILY GET YOU A GOOD JOB IN NEW YORK
IN HIS HEART HE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT HE COULD NEVER BE HAPPY FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME OUT OF SIGHT AND HEARING OF BROADWAY CARS BUT AT THAT MOMENT SUCH WAS THE MAGIC OF THE DAWN HE FELT A LONGING TO SETTLE DOWN IN THE COUNTRY AND PASS THE REST OF HIS DAYS A SIMPLE FARMER
WHICH IS A DEAR LITTLE ARMY SHOULD BE KEPT TO ITSELF BLOODED ON DETACHMENT DUTY TURNED INTO THE PATHS OF SCIENCE AND NOW AND AGAIN ASSEMBLED AT FEASTS OF FREE MASONS AND SO FORTH IT IS TOO TINY TO BE A POLITICAL POWER
ROUND WHICH THE MILITIA OF THE COUNTRY WILL RALLY AND FROM WHICH THEY WILL GET A STIFFENING IN TIME OF DANGER YET OTHER PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT THE ARMY SHOULD BE BUILT LIKE A PAIR OF LAZY TONGS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF ELASTICITY AND EXTENSION
AND WITH ALL THE RACIAL DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE TO BACK HIM THROUGH ANY DEMI SEMI PROFESSIONAL GENERALSHIP
IT AIN'T AS IF WE WAS A VAUDEVILLE TEAM THAT HAD GOT TO REHEARSE WHAT'S REHEARSE STEVE CHANGED THE SUBJECT SAY KID AIN'T YOU FEELING LIKE YOU COULD BITE INTO SOMETHING
AND THIS WAS HER FIRST LETTER POLLY HAD A WARM HEART AND DID NOT FORGET HER FRIENDS BUT SHE WAS NOT A GOOD CORRESPONDENT THE NEED OF GETTING HER THINGS READY AT ONCE DROVE THE LETTER FROM CLAIRE'S MIND SHE WAS IN THE TRAIN ON HER WAY TO SOUTHAMPTON
COME IN TO TRADE WITH THE ZION MERCANTILE CO OPERATIVE INSTITUTE THE CHURCH I FANCY LOOKS AFTER THE FINANCES OF THIS THING AND IT CONSEQUENTLY PAYS GOOD DIVIDENDS THE FACES OF THE WOMEN WERE NOT LOVELY IN DEED
THEY CAN LEGISLATE LYNCH HUNT NEGROES THROUGH SWAMPS DIVORCE RAILROAD AND RAMPAGE AS MUCH AS EVER THEY CHOOSE THEY DO NOT NEED KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR OWN MILITARY STRENGTH TO BACK THEIR GENIAL LAWLESSNESS THAT REGULAR ARMY
WHEN SHE ASKED HIM A QUESTION AS IF SHE HAD SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD COMMIT SOME CRIME
THE WHITE HOPE GURGLED DROWSILY BUT DID NOT WAKE STEVE CARRIED HIM ON TO THE PORCH AND LAID HIM DOWN THEN HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM OF EFFECTING AN ENTRY ONCE AN HONEST MAN HAS TAKEN TO AMATEUR BURGLING HE SOON PICKS UP THE TRICKS OF IT
STEVE HAVING DISPOSED OF TWO EGGS IN QUICK SUCCESSION
A GIRL HAS TO BE IN A SUNNIER MOOD THAN SHE WAS TO BEAR UP WITHOUT WINCING UNDER THE INFLICTION OF A DUET CONSISTING OF THE ROCK OF AGES AND WAITING FOR THE ROBERT E LEE ASSUREDLY CLAIRE PROPOSED TO HURRY
TEN REGIMENTS CAVALRY TWELVE COMPANIES EACH FIVE REGIMENTS ARTILLERY TWELVE COMPANIES EACH NOW THERE IS A NOTION IN THE AIR TO REORGANIZE THE SERVICE ON THESE LINES EIGHTEEN REGIMENTS INFANTRY AT FOUR BATTALIONS FOUR COMPANIES EACH
THE SUN WAS HIGH WHEN STEVE WOKE HE ROSE STIFFLY AND WENT INTO THE OTHER ROOM WILLIAM BANNISTER STILL SLEPT STEVE REGARDED HIM ADMIRINGLY FOR THE DORMOUSE ACT HE MUSED
I LOVE HIM DEARLY YOUR AFFECTIONATE POLLY WETHERBY CLAIRE SANK BACK AGAINST THE CUSHIONED SEAT
THEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER HOTEL TO WRITE A LETTER HOME NOTIFYING HER MOTHER OF HER PLANS SHE LOOKED AT HER WATCH IT WAS SIX O'CLOCK BACK IN WEST KENSINGTON A RICH SMELL OF DINNER WOULD BE FLOATING THROUGH THE FLAT THE COOK
AND NOW IT'S PICTURES I DON'T MIND HIS PAINTING IT GIVES HIM SOMETHING TO DO AND KEEPS HIM OUT OF MISCHIEF HE HAS A STUDIO DOWN IN WASHINGTON SQUARE AND IS PERFECTLY HAPPY MESSING ABOUT THERE ALL DAY EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE IF HE DIDN'T THINK IT NECESSARY
YOU DO WHAT I TELL YOU AND YOU CAN'T GO WRONG IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A REGULAR GERM
THE DROPPED H BETRAYED HER AND WHEN DID YOU LEAVE ENGLAND I SAID SUMMER OF EIGHTY FOUR
THAT'S ONE THING GERMS NEVER DO EAT BREAD OUT OF CRINKLY PAPER
TO OPEN HIS KNIFE AND SHOOT BACK THE CATCH OF THE NEAREST WINDOW
I WAS BORN IN CARBONDALE ILLINOIS BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER I'M AN ENGLISH COUNTESS DOING BAREFOOT DANCING TO WORK OFF THE MORTGAGE ON THE ANCESTRAL CASTLE AND THEY EAT ME TAKE IT FROM ME CLAIRE I'M A RIOT WELL THAT'S THAT
HE CLIMBED IN AND UNLOCKED THE FRONT DOOR THEN HE CARRIED HIS YOUNG CHARGE INTO THE SITTING ROOM AND LAID HIM DOWN ON A CHAIR
I SAY CLAIRE IT'S GOT AN AMERICAN STAMP ON IT CAN I HAVE IT CLAIRE I HAVEN'T GOT ONE IN MY COLLECTION HIS SISTER REGARDED HIM BROODINGLY FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T BELLOW LIKE THAT SHE SAID OF COURSE YOU CAN HAVE THE STAMP I DON'T WANT IT
FOR THE LAST PERSON ROSCOE SHERRIFF HANDLED AN EMOTIONAL ACTRESS NAMED DEVENISH HAD TO KEEP A YOUNG PUMA BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE END OF IT WAS THAT HE RANG OFF
HE WENT ON QUICKLY AS HIS GODSON OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK
IT IS NOT SEEMLY FOR A FREE AND INDEPENDENT CITIZEN TO DUB HIMSELF A GENTILE BUT THE MAYOR OF OGDEN WHICH IS THE GENTILE CITY OF THE VALLEY TOLD ME THAT THERE MUST BE SOME DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO FLOCKS LONG BEFORE THE FRUIT ORCHARDS OF LOGAN
NO PAPER REPEATED THE WHITE HOPE FIRMLY STEVE REGARDED HIM THOUGHTFULLY I DIDN'T HAVE THIS TRIP PLANNED OUT RIGHT HE SAID REGRETFULLY I OUGHT TO HAVE GOT MAMIE TO COME ALONG
CONFIDED TO ME THAT SHE HATED THE IDEA OF SALT LAKE CITY BEING TURNED INTO A SHOW PLACE FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE GENTILES
AND WE'LL SCARE UP SOME BREAKFAST STEVE'S IGNORANCE OF THE LOCALITY IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF WAS COMPLETE BUT HE HAD A GENERAL IMPRESSION THAT FARMERS AS A CLASS WERE PEOPLE WHO DELIGHTED IN PROVIDING BREAKFASTS FOR THE NEEDY IF THE NEEDY POSSESSED THE NECESSARY PRICE
THEN I WENT ABOUT THE STREETS AND PEEPED INTO PEOPLE'S FRONT WINDOWS AND THE DECORATIONS UPON THE TABLES WERE AFTER THE MANNER OF THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FIFTY MAIN STREET WAS FULL OF COUNTRY FOLK FROM THE DESERT
A MAN ROSE UP AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE THE CHOSEN OF GOD THE ELECT OF ISRAEL THAT THEY WERE TO OBEY THEIR PRIESTS AND THAT THERE WAS A GOOD TIME COMING I FANCY THAT THEY HAD
WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT PAPER AUNTY LORA SAYS NOT TO EAT BREAD THAT DOESN'T COME WRAPPED UP IN PAPER SAID THE WHITE HOPE BECOMING SURPRISINGLY LUCID MAMIE UNDOES IT OUT OF CRINKLY PAPER I GET YOU
IT'S THE ELDERS BUSINESS AN BETWEEN YOU AN ME I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING ON MUCH LONGER
SEEMED SUDDENLY LESS ATTRACTIVE BED WAS WHAT HE WANTED NOW NOT NATURE
THERE ARE THE MAKINGS OF A VERY FINE CREED ABOUT MORMONISM TO BEGIN WITH THE CHURCH IS RATHER MORE ABSOLUTE THAN THAT OF ROME DROP THE POLYGAMY PLANK IN THE PLATFORM
I SHOWED ONE OF THEM THAT PHOTOGRAPH YOU GAVE ME AND HE WENT UP IN THE AIR THEY PAY TWICE AS BIG SALARIES OVER HERE YOU KNOW AS IN ENGLAND SO COME BY THE NEXT BOAT CLAIRE DARLING YOU MUST COME I'M WRETCHED ALGIE HAS GOT MY GOAT THE WORST WAY
I'M GOING TO HURRY SAID CLAIRE CLENCHING HER FISTS AS TWO SIMULTANEOUS BURSTS OF SONG IN DIFFERENT KEYS AND VARYING TEMPOS
THE ROBINS WHICH THOUGH NOT SO WELL ADVERTISED RISE JUST AS PUNCTUALLY AS THE LARK WERE BEGINNING TO SING AS THEY MADE THEIR SIMPLE TOILETS BEFORE SETTING OUT TO ATTEND TO THE EARLY WORM
BEFORE SHE REMEMBERED ITS EXISTENCE IT WAS DATED FROM NEW YORK MY DEAR OLD CLAIRE IS THIS REALLY MY FIRST LETTER TO YOU ISN'T THAT AWFUL GEE A LOT'S HAPPENED SINCE I SAW YOU LAST I MUST TELL YOU
AND FOUND HIM EYEING A BOWL OF BREAD AND MILK IN A SORT OF FROZEN HORROR
WATCHING THE BOILING CABBAGE WOULD BE SINGING A FEW MORE YEARS SHALL ROLL HER MOTHER WOULD BE SIGHING AND HER LITTLE BROTHER PERCY WOULD BE EMPLOYED UPON SOME
FROM WHICH THE STOPPING OF THE CAR DID NOT AWAKEN HIM STEVE JUMPED DOWN AND STRETCHED HIMSELF THERE WAS A WONDERFUL FRESHNESS IN THE AIR WHICH MADE HIM FORGET FOR A MOMENT HIS DESIRE FOR REPOSE HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM BREATHING DEEP DRAUGHTS OF ITS COOLNESS
BY GREAT GOOD LUCK THE EVIL MINDED TRAIN ALREADY DELAYED TWELVE HOURS BY A BURNED BRIDGE BROUGHT ME TO THE CITY ON A SATURDAY
SO WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF LOOKING SHOCKED AND SAYING
COULD DRIVE THE HULKING BOARD FACED MEN INTO IT THE WOMEN WORE HIDEOUS GARMENTS AND THE MEN APPEARED TO BE TIED UP WITH STRINGS
FIRST ABOUT MY HIT SOME HIT CLAIRE OLD GIRL I OWN NEW YORK
SHARK MOUTHED PIG EARED HEAVY BONED FARMERS SOMETIMES TAKE TO THEIR CREED WITH WILDEST FANATICISM AND IN PAST YEARS HAVE MADE LIFE EXCESSIVELY UNPLEASANT FOR THE GENTILE WHEN HE WAS FEW IN THE LAND
HE SAID AND WHILE I'M THERE MAYBE I'D BETTER SEND KIRK A WIRE AND I RECKON I'LL HAVE TO TAKE THE KID IF HE WAKES UP AND FINDS ME GONE HE'LL THROW FITS UP YOU GET SQUIRE
AND WENT SO BIG THAT MY AGENT SHIFTED ME TO THE RESTAURANTS AND THEY HAVE TO CALL OUT THE POLICE RESERVES TO HANDLE THE CROWD YOU CAN'T GET A TABLE AT REIGELHEIMER'S WHICH IS MY PITCH
IS THAT YOU CLAIRE YES MOTHER I'VE COME BACK TO PACK THEY WANT ME TO GO TO SOUTHAMPTON TO NIGHT TO TAKE UP CLAUDIA WINSLOW'S PART WHAT TRAIN ARE YOU CATCHING
WHILE MAKING A NERVE RACKING NOISE IN ANOTHER IT WAS PERCY WHO GREETED HER TO DAY AS SHE ENTERED THE FLAT HALLOA CLAIRE I SAY CLAIRE THERE'S A LETTER FOR YOU IT CAME BY THE SECOND POST
HEARD ALL THIS BEFORE SO MANY TIMES IT PRODUCED NO IMPRESSION WHATEVER EVEN AS THE SUBLIMEST MYSTERIES OF ANOTHER FAITH LOSE SALT THROUGH CONSTANT ITERATION
I THOUGHT FROM THE WAY YOU SPOKE HE WAS A REGULAR KID KNOW ANY ONE IN THESE PARTS WHO'S GOT SOMETHING ABOUT THE SAME WEIGHT AS THIS ONE THE FARMER'S WIFE REFLECTED KIDS IS PRETTY SCARCE ROUND HERE SHE SAID I RECKON YOU WON'T GET ONE THAT I KNOWS OF
HIS SURMISE AS TO THE HOSPITALITY OF FARMERS PROVED CORRECT AND PRESENTLY THEY WERE SITTING DOWN TO A BREAKFAST WHICH IT DID HIS FAMISHED SOUL GOOD TO CONTEMPLATE WILLIAM BANNISTER SEEMED LESS ENTHUSIASTIC
I HAVE SOME PULL THESE DAYS BELIEVE ME NOT THAT YOU'LL NEED MY HELP
THE AUTOMOBILE THE CAR THE CHUG CHUG WAGON THE THING WE CAME HERE IN
AND ON SUNDAY GO TO THE PRAYING PLACE I TRIED TO TALK TO A FEW OF THEM BUT THEY SPOKE STRANGE TONGUES AND STARED AND BEHAVED LIKE COWS YET ONE WOMAN AND NOT AN ALTOGETHER UGLY ONE
TO TACK ON THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT TO HIS PAINTING HE'S DEVELOPED THE IDEA THAT HE HAS NERVES AND EVERYTHING UPSETS THEM THINGS CAME TO A HEAD THIS MORNING AT BREAKFAST CLARENCE MY SNAKE
BECAUSE HE IS A HIDEOUSLY VERSATILE AMERICAN TO BEGIN WITH
HE'S A BAD BOY WELL
SO THAT IN TIME OF NEED IT MAY FILL UP ITS SKELETON BATTALIONS AND EMPTY SADDLE TROOPS THIS IS REAL WISDOM BE CAUSE THE AMERICAN ARMY AS AT PRESENT CONSTITUTED IS MADE UP OF TWENTY FIVE REGIMENTS INFANTRY TEN COMPANIES EACH
IT WAS A LONG LETTER TOO LONG TO BE READ UNTIL SHE WAS AT LEISURE AND WRITTEN IN A STRAGGLING HAND THAT MADE READING DIFFICULT SHE WAS MILDLY SURPRISED THAT POLLY SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN HER FOR SHE HAD BEEN BACK IN AMERICA A YEAR OR MORE NOW
BUT IF THINGS ARE THE SAME WITH YOU AS IN THE OLD DAYS YOU CAN'T BE ROLLING
WITH A DEEP SIGH OF REPLETION STEVE MEANWHILE HAD ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SAY
BY WAY OF THAT VALLEY WHICH THE MORMONS OVER THEIR EFFORTS HAD CAUSED TO BLOSSOM LIKE THE ROSE TWELVE HOURS PREVIOUSLY I HAD ENTERED INTO A NEW WORLD WHERE IN CONVERSATION EVERY ONE WAS EITHER A MORMON OR A GENTILE
HE'S ONE OF THEM RICH NEW YAWKERS HE HAS HIS SUMMER PLACE HERE
HE REALIZED WITH THE ABRUPTNESS WHICH COMES TO A MAN WHO STANDS ALONE WITH NATURE IN THE SMALL HOURS THAT HE WAS VERY SLEEPY THE EXCITEMENT WHICH HAD SUSTAINED HIM TILL NOW HAD BEGUN TO EBB THE FREE LIFE OF THE BEARDED FARMER
I'M DOING BAREFOOT DANCING
A HAZY NOTION THAT BLANKETS WERE ALWAYS SAFE RESTORED HIS SPIRITS AND HE BECAME CHEERFUL ON REFLECTING THAT A CHILD WITH WILLIAM BANNISTER'S GIFT FOR SLEEP WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO NOTICE THE ABSENCE OF LINEN IN HIS BED THE COUCH WHICH HE FINALLY PASSED ADEQUATE
IT'S ONE WAY OF FIXING EM WHAT'S FIXING INQUIRED WILLIAM BANNISTER BRIGHTLY STEVE SIGHED WHEN HE SPOKE HE WAS CALM BUT DETERMINED THAT'LL BE ALL THE DIALOGUE FOR THE PRESENT HE SAID WE'LL PLAY THE REST OF OUR ACT IN DUMB SHOW GET A MOVE ON YOU
FLAT AS A TABLE AGAINST THE FLANKS OF THE RINGING HILLS MARKS WHERE THE SALT LAKE RESTED FOR AWHILE IN ITS COLLAPSE
SHE MEANT TO GET HER PACKING DONE IN RECORD TIME AND ESCAPE FROM THIS PLACE SHE WENT INTO HER BEDROOM AND BEGAN TO THROW THINGS UNTIDILY INTO HER TRUNK
BED STEVE'S FACULTIES WERE RAPIDLY BECOMING NUMB WITH APPROACHING SLEEP BUT HE ROUSED HIMSELF TO FACE CERTAIN DETAILS OF THE COUNTRY LIFE WHICH TILL NOW HAD ESCAPED HIM
AS IF HE WERE A SUPERIOR BEING OF SOME KIND GOVERNED BY CODES WHICH SHE COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT RIGHT HAD LORD DAWLISH TO LOOK DOWN HIS NOSE AND MURMUR
A GLANCE HAD TOLD HER THAT IT WAS FROM HER FRIEND POLLY COUNTESS OF WETHERBY
BUT HIS FATHER USED TO BE A LOW PRIZE FIGHTER AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE STEVE NODDED SYMPATHETICALLY
HE DECLINED TO CROSS THE THRESHOLD AGAIN UNTIL I HAD GOT RID OF EUSTACE AND CLARENCE I TRIED TO REASON WITH HIM
THE OMNIBUS ROLLED ON TOWARDS WEST KENSINGTON CLAIRE HATED THE PLACE WITH THE BITTER HATE OF ONE WHO HAD READ SOCIETY NOVELS AND YEARNED FOR GROSVENOR SQUARE AND BUTLERS AND A GENERAL ATMOSPHERE OF SOFT CUSHIONS AND PINK SHADED LIGHTS
YOU HAVE A FIRST CLASS ENGINE FOR PIONEER WORK THE TAWDRY MYSTICISM AND THE BORROWING FROM FREEMASONRY SERVE THE LOW CASTE SWEDE AND DANE THE WELSHMAN AND THE CORNISH COTTER JUST AS WELL AS A HIGHLY ORGANIZED HEAVEN
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND DEAL LIGHTLY WITH CERTAIN FORMS OF EXCESS KEEP THE QUALITY OF THE RECRUIT DOWN TO THE LOW MENTAL LEVEL AND SEE THAT THE BEST OF ALL THE AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AVAILABLE IS IN THE HANDS OF THE ELDERS AND THERE
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IT MEANS THAT HE'S BEHAVING LIKE A PERFECT PIG I HARDLY KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN WELL IT WAS THIS WAY DIRECTLY I MADE MY HIT MY PRESS AGENT A REAL BRIGHT MAN NAMED SHERRIFF GOT BUSY OF COURSE INTERVIEWS YOU KNOW
WOULD HAVE CAUSED LORA DELANE PORTER'S HAIR TO STAND ERECT BUT IT SATISFIED STEVE HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND RETURNING WITH WILLIAM BANNISTER PLACED HIM CAREFULLY ON IT AND TUCKED HIM IN THE WHITE HOPE SLEPT ON HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF THAT ALL WAS WELL
SURE I HAVE SAID THE HOSTESS PROUDLY
THE SKY TO THE EAST WAS A DELICATE BLEND OF PINKS AND GREENS AND YELLOWS WITH A HINT OF BLUE BEHIND THE GREY WHICH WAS STILL THE PREVAILING NOTE A VAGUELY SENTIMENTAL MOOD CAME UPON STEVE
OBSERVE THE BEAUTY OF THIS BUSINESS THE THIRD BATTALION WILL HAVE ITS OFFICERS BUT NO MEN THE FOURTH WILL PROBABLY HAVE A RENDEZVOUS AND SOME EQUIPMENT IT IS NOT CONTEMPLATED TO GIVE IT ANYTHING MORE DEFINITE AT PRESENT
BUT TO DAY SO FAR FROM KILLING OPENLY OR SECRETLY OR BURNING GENTILE FARMS IT IS ALL THE MORMON DARE DO TO FEEBLY TRY TO BOYCOTT THE INTERLOPER
HE INSPECTED STEVE GRAVELY FOR A MOMENT ENDEAVOURING TO PLACE HIM HELLO STEVE HE SAID AT LENGTH HELLO KID WHERE AM I IN THE COUNTRY IN CONNECTICUT WHAT'S NECTICUT
THEY FEED YOU ROLLS AT HOME WRAPPED UP IN TISSUE PAPER IS THAT IT WHAT'S TISSUE SAME AS CRINKLY WELL SEE HERE YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE WAS TALKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT ABOUT GERMS YES WELL
TO THE HUGE DELIGHT OF THE OFFICERS THE MILITARY NEEDS OF THE STATES BE THREE A FRONTIER WARFARE
AND MAIDS TO DO ONE'S HAIR SHE HATED THE CHEAP FURNITURE OF THE LITTLE PARLOUR THE PENETRATING CONTRALTO OF THE COOK SINGING HYMNS IN THE KITCHEN AND THE UBIQUITOUSNESS OF HER SMALL BROTHER HE WAS ONLY TEN AND SMALL FOR HIS AGE
LEAVING SOUTHAMPTON ON THE TWENTY FOURTH OF THIS MONTH
OR THE SHINING LEVELS OF THE SALT LAKE HAD BEEN REACHED THAT MAYOR HIMSELF A GENTILE AND ONE RENOWNED FOR HIS DEALINGS WITH THE MORMONS TOLD ME THAT THE GREAT QUESTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE POWER WITHIN THE POWER
AND GET HEAVILY SHOT IN A SORT OF CHEAP HALF CONSTRUCTED WARFARE INSTEAD OF BEING DECENTLY SCARED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE MILITARY THIS SORT OF ARRANGEMENT DOES NOT SEEM WISE
PAINTING FOOTLING LITTLE PICTURES AND HAS GOT THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT BADLY
GOT NEXT TO YOUR MEANINGS IN A SECOND I PASS
THOUGH ONE COULD BE CERTAIN THAT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING INVOLVING A DEAFENING NOISE CLAIRE
THE SWEDES THEY THINK IT HIS I KNOW IT HISN'T BUT YOU'VE GOT YOUR LAND ALL RIGHT OH YES WE'VE GOT OUR LAND AN WE NEVER SAY AUGHT AGAINST POLYGAMY O COURSE
HAD KEPT HER ALOOF FROM THE REST OF HER FELLOW WORKERS BUT IT TOOK MORE THAN A SHIVERING GENTILITY TO STAVE OFF POLLY CLAIRE HAD PASSED THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES OF INTIMACY WITH HER
STRUCK HIM A VIOLENT BLOW ON THE NOSE WITH A TEASPOON THEN HE TURNED TO ME VERY PALE AND SAID PAULINE THIS MUST END THE TIME HAS COME TO SPEAK UP A NERVOUS HIGHLY STRUNG MAN LIKE MYSELF SHOULD NOT AND MUST NOT BE CALLED UPON TO LIVE IN A HOUSE
FORTY GENERALS AND A MASS OF W O FORMS WE SAY WE POSSESS AN ARMY CORPS CAPABLE OF INDEFINITE EXTENSION THE AMERICAN ARMY IS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ARMY SOME DAY WHEN ALL THE INDIANS ARE HAPPILY DEAD OR DRUNK
AND THE DEAR PEOPLE DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO WITH IT
THAT KID CERTAINLY STANDS ALONE YOU GOT TO HAND IT TO HIM
WE GET AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND MEN WHICH
HAS THE CUTEST WAY OF CLIMBING UP THE LEG OF THE TABLE
AND TALKING ABOUT A LADY WETHERBY TEN MINUTES LATER HER PASSAGE SECURED CLAIRE WAS WALKING TO THE LOCAL THEATRE TO INFORM THOSE IN CHARGE OF THE DESTINIES OF THE GIRL AND THE ARTIST NUMBER ONE COMPANY THAT THEY MUST LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR A SUBSTITUTE FOR MISS CLAUDIA WINSLOW
ON A TABLE LAND OVERLOOKING ALL THE CITY
WHILE MAMIE IN A COTTON FROCK CALLED CHEERFULLY TO HIM TO COME IN BECAUSE BREAKFAST WAS READY AND GETTING COLD MAMIE AH HIS SIGH TURNED INTO A YAWN
AND IN THE NATURE OF THINGS GROWING LESS ARDUOUS YEAR BY YEAR B INTERNAL RIOTS AND COMMOTIONS WHICH RISE UP LIKE A DUST DEVIL WHIRL FURIOUSLY AND DIE OUT LONG BEFORE THE AUTHORITIES AT WASHINGTON COULD BEGIN TO FILL UP EVEN THE THIRD SKELETON BATTALIONS
THIS IS WHERE WE ARE WHERE ARE WE HERE IN CONNECTICUT WHY STEVE RAISED A PROTESTING HAND NOT SO EARLY IN THE DAY KID NOT BEFORE BREAKFAST HE PLEADED HONEST I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH
ALGIE KICKED FROM THE FIRST I OUGHT TO TELL YOU THAT SINCE WE LEFT ENGLAND
COME RIGHT OVER AN HOUR LATER THE MANAGER OF THE SOUTHAMPTON BRANCH OF THE WHITE STAR LINE WAS DAZZLED BY AN APPARITION A BEAUTIFUL GIRL WHO BURST IN UPON HIM WITH FLUSHED FACE AND SHINING EYES DEMANDING A BERTH ON THE STEAMSHIP ATLANTIC
YAWNING WEARILY HE SET OUT ON HIS SEARCH HE FOUND SHEETS BUT MISTRUSTED THEM THEY MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE PERFECTLY DRY HE DID NOT CARE TO RISK HIS GODSON'S VALUABLE HEALTH IN THE EXPERIMENT
THE IMMORTAL WRECK OF THE GRAND ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC IS A POLITICAL POWER OF THE LARGEST AND MOST UNBLUSHING DESCRIPTION IT OUGHT NOT TO HELP TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF AN AMATEUR MILITARY POWER THAT IS BLIND AND IRRESPONSIBLE
A BOY GOES UP TO THAT INSTITUTION GETS HIS PASS AND RETURNS TO CIVIL LIFE SO THEY TELL ME WITH A DANGEROUS KNOWLEDGE THAT HE IS A SUCKLING VON MOLTKE AND MAY APPLY HIS LEARNING WHEN OCCASION OFFERS GIVEN TROUBLE THAT MAN WILL BE A NUISANCE
STEVE MADE UP A SIMILAR NEST FOR HIMSELF AND REMOVING HIS COAT AND SHOES CRAWLED UNDER THE BLANKETS FIVE MINUTES LATER RHYTHMICAL SNORES PROCLAIMED THE FACT THAT NATURE HAD TRIUMPHED OVER ALL THE DISCOMFORTS OF ONE OF THE WORST MADE BEDS IN CONNECTICUT
HE ASKED GET BUSY NO PAPER SAID WILLIAM BANNISTER FOR THE LOVE OF PETE
POLLY MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SHE REFLECTED BITTERLY SHE TOOK THE LETTER UP AGAIN AND SAW THAT ON THE LAST PAGE THERE WAS A POSTSCRIPT P S I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU ARE FIXED FOR MONEY OLD GIRL
WHERE HE IS CONSTANTLY MEETING SNAKES AND MONKEYS WITHOUT WARNING CHOOSE BETWEEN ME AND
THAT HE HAD NOT PLANNED OUT THIS EXPEDITION WITH THAT THOROUGHNESS WHICH MARKS THE GREAT GENERAL
IN WHICH AS THE CASE IN THE AFFAIR OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH THE REGULAR ARMY WOULD BE SWAMPED IN THE MASS OF MILITIA AND ARMED VOLUNTEERS WOULD TURN THE LAND INTO A HELL YET THE AUTHORITIES PERSIST IN REGARDING AN EXTERNAL WAR
OF COURSE IT'S THE TITLE THAT DOES IT LADY PAULINE WETHERBY ALGIE SAYS IT OUGHTN'T TO BE THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT THE DAUGHTER OF A DUKE
HIT THE HAY THERE WAS THE WHITE HOPE'S BED TO BE MADE AND BY THE WAY OF A PRELIMINARY TO THAT SHEETS MUST BE FOUND AND BLANKETS
HE'S NOT USED TO COUNTRY LIFE COME ALONG
WAS BEING GRADUALLY SOLVED BY THE BALLOT AND BY EDUCATION ALL THE BEAUTY OF THE VALLEY COULD NOT MAKE ME FORGET IT AND THE VALLEY IS VERY FAIR BENCH AFTER BENCH OF LAND
WILLIAM BANNISTER MADE NO MORE OBJECTIONS HE ATTACKED HIS MEAL WITH AN EASY CONSCIENCE
THE SHOP WALKER BRINGS UP PARALLEL TO THE COUNTER ANY PARTICULAR TIME WHEN YOU WANT YOUR HOLIDAYS HE ASKS HOOPDRIVER PULLS AT HIS SKIMPY MOUSTACHE NO DON'T WANT THEM TOO LATE SIR OF COURSE
THE WRETCHED CREATURE HAS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY SULLIED OUR MODEST BUT TRUTHFUL PAGES WE LEAVE THE EAGER LITTLE GROUP IN THE BAR OF THE VICUNA HOTEL WE LEAVE ALL BOGNOR AS WE HAVE LEFT ALL CHICHESTER
SAVE PERHAPS FOR A CURSE OR SO AT HIS PIPE AND THEN BREAK OUT WITH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF TIPS AVOID RUNNING OVER DOGS HOOPDRIVER WHATEVER YOU DO
SAID HOOPDRIVER AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE PULLING AT THE INSUFFICIENT MOUSTACHE
LET US ASSUME SOMETHING OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT THE HARD ALMOST PROFESSORIAL TONE OF THE CONSCIENTIOUS REALIST LET US TREAT THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS AS A MERE DIAGRAM AND INDICATE THE POINTS OF INTEREST WITH THE UNEMOTIONAL
THE THING THAT MUST BE TOLD IF THE BOOK IS TO BE WRITTEN WAS LET US FACE IT BRAVELY THE REMARKABLE CONDITION OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS LET US APPROACH THE BUSINESS WITH DISPASSIONATE EXPLICITNESS
BUT ENOUGH OF THESE REVELATIONS THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY IS NOW GOING ALONG BEHIND THE COUNTER A DRAPER INDEED WITH YOUR PURCHASES IN HIS ARMS TO THE WAREHOUSE WHERE THE VARIOUS ARTICLES YOU HAVE SELECTED WILL PRESENTLY BE PACKED BY THE SENIOR PORTER AND SENT TO YOU
THEN AMIDST VILLAS AGAIN SOME WARM AND LAMPLIT SOME WHITE AND SLEEPING IN THE MOONLIGHT THEN BETWEEN HEDGES OVER WHICH THEY SAW BROAD WAN MEADOWS SHROUDED IN A LOW LYING MIST
WE COULD SHOW YOU SOMETHING BETTER OF COURSE NO TROUBLE MADAM I ASSURE YOU SUCH WERE THE SIMPLE COUNTERS OF HIS INTERCOURSE SO I SAY
THE MUTE EMOTION OF HIS FACE AFFECTED HER STRANGELY SHE HAD TO SPEAK
ON ITS EXTERNAL ASPECT A LARGE YELLOWISH BRUISE ON HIS LEFT SHIN THERE WERE TWO BRUISES ONE A LEADEN YELLOW GRADUATING HERE AND THERE INTO PURPLE AND ANOTHER OBVIOUSLY OF MORE RECENT DATE OF A BLOTCHY RED
THE MOONLIGHT RIDE AND SO THE TWENTY MINUTES LAW PASSED INTO AN INFINITY
HULLO SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER SOTTO VOCE THEY DISMOUNTED ABRUPTLY STUNTED OAKS AND THORNS ROSE OUT OF THE HAZE OF MOONLIGHT THAT WAS TANGLED IN THE HEDGE ON EITHER SIDE
YOU WOULD MAKE ME YOUR BROTHER MISS BEAUMONT YES WE COULD STOP THERE TOGETHER SHE TOOK A MINUTE TO ANSWER I AM GOING TO LIGHT THESE LAMPS SAID HOOPDRIVER HE BENT DOWN TO HIS OWN AND STRUCK A MATCH ON HIS SHOE
TUMID AND THREATENING PROCEEDING UP THE LEFT LEG IN A SPIRAL MANNER AN UNNATURAL HARDNESS AND REDNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ON THE UPPER ASPECT OF THE CALF
THEY'RE GOING FAIRLY WELL SIR
THE LEFT AS ONE WHO KNEW SO IT WAS THAT IN THE SPACE OF AN HOUR THEY CAME ABRUPTLY DOWN A LITTLE LANE FULL TILT UPON THE SEA
HE WOULD HAVE DANCED ABOUT BEHIND THE COUNTER HAVE NEATLY REFOLDED THE GOODS HE HAD SHOWN YOU HAVE PUT ON ONE SIDE THOSE YOU SELECTED EXTRACTED A LITTLE BOOK WITH A CARBON LEAF AND A TINFOIL SHEET FROM A FIXTURE
WOULD HAVE FANCIED NOTHING OF THE KIND
HAIR OF A KIND OF DIRTY FAIRNESS GREYISH EYES AND A SKIMPY IMMATURE MOUSTACHE UNDER HIS PEAKED INDETERMINATE NOSE HIS FEATURES WERE ALL SMALL BUT NONE ILL SHAPED A ROSETTE OF PINS DECORATED THE LAPPEL OF HIS COAT
HUCKABACK BLANKETS DIMITY CRETONNE LINEN CALICO ARE CASES IN POINT
THROUGH THE CHAMBERS OF HIS BRAIN SEEKING SOME KNIGHTLY QUEST IN HONOUR OF THAT FAIR LADY THE LAST BUT ONE OF THE GIRL APPRENTICES TO THE DRESS MAKING UPSTAIRS
AND HIS ONLY RAY OF HOPE WAS THAT IT SEEMED MORE PROBABLE AFTER ALL THAT THE GIRL HAD ESCAPED THROUGH HER STEPMOTHER IN WHICH CASE THE BUSINESS MIGHT BE HUSHED UP YET AND THE EVIL HOUR OF EXPLANATION WITH HIS WIFE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED
SHE WHO HAS SPIRITUALISED THE WORLD ALONE SAVE FOR TWO ATTENDANT STEADY SHINING STARS AND IN SILENCE UNDER HER BENIGN INFLUENCE UNDER THE BENEDICTION OF HER LIGHT RODE OUR TWO WANDERERS SIDE BY SIDE THROUGH THE TRANSFIGURED AND TRANSFIGURING NIGHT
FOR UPON EVERY ONE OF THEM WAITS THE JEST OF THE UNEXPECTED TREADLE YOU TRY AT LEAST TO WALK YOUR MACHINE IN AN EASY MANNER AND WHACK YOU ARE RUBBING YOUR SHIN SO OUT OF INNOCENCE WE RIPEN
BUT AS YET HE SEEMED MERELY STUNNED BROWN CLOTHES HE SAID AND FAIRISH A LITTLE LIKE YOURSELF SIR IN THE DARK THE OSTLER SIR JIM DUKE
IT WASN'T THAT ONE AT ALL MISS SAID THE OSTLER I'D SWEAR WELL THAT'S MISTER BEAUMONT SAID THE BARMAID ANYHOW THEIR CONVERSATION HUNG COMATOSE IN THE AIR SWITCHED UP BY BECHAMEL
SAYN THEN A PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE COME INTO VIEW
SHE SAID WITH A LAUGH TO BREAK THE INTENSITY HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SHUT IT AGAIN AND WITH A SUDDEN WINCING OF HIS FEATURES ABRUPTLY TURNED AND BENT DOWN TO OPEN THE LANTERN IN FRONT OF HER MACHINE SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HIM
HE INCLINES RATHER TO STREET FIGHTING AGAINST REVOLUTIONARIES BECAUSE THEN SHE COULD SEE HIM FROM THE WINDOW JERKING THEM BACK TO THE PRESENT COMES THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WITH A PAPER IN HIS HAND THE APPRENTICE BECOMES EXTREMELY ACTIVE
QUITE A MISUNDERSTANDING SAID HOOPDRIVER WITH SPLENDID READINESS MY SISTER HAD GONE TO BOGNOR BUT I BROUGHT HER BACK HERE I'VE TOOK A FANCY TO THIS PLACE AND THE MOONLIGHT'S SIMPLY DEE VINE WE'VE HAD SUPPER THENKS AND WE'RE TIRED SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER
A VOICE THAT CAME FROM ROUND A FITFUL GLOW OF LIGHT WAS SAYING AND CLEAN THE CHAIN DAILY WITH BLACK LEAD YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT
GRAVE AND INTENT HOW COULD SHE EVER HAVE THOUGHT HIM COMMON OR ABSURD BUT YOU MUST TELL ME YOUR NAME BROTHER SHE SAID ER CARRINGTON SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER AFTER A MOMENTARY PAUSE
WHAT WE HAD BEST BE DOING YOU ARE TIRED YOU KNOW AND WE CAN'T WANDER ALL NIGHT AFTER THE DAY WE'VE HAD THAT WAS CHICHESTER WE WERE NEAR SHE ASKED IF HE MEDITATED WITH A TREMBLE IN HIS VOICE
I BECHAMEL WHEN WITH AN ABRUPT TAP AND PROMPT OPENING OF THE DOOR STEPHEN ENTERED WITH THE BOURBON
MADE YOU OUT A LITTLE BILL IN THAT WEAK FLOURISHING HAND PECULIAR TO DRAPERS
FIRED BY THESE DISCOVERIES AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES FURTHER TO BRUISES ON THE SHOULDERS ELBOWS AND EVEN THE FINGER JOINTS OF THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY
YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERVED BY THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY THAT IS NOW BEGINNING HE WOULD HAVE COME FORWARD BOWING AND SWAYING
TWO BRUISES ON THAT PLACE MARK A CERTAIN WANT OF APTITUDE IN LEARNING SUCH AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN A PERSON UNUSED TO MUSCULAR EXERCISE BLISTERS ON THE HANDS ARE ELOQUENT OF THE NERVOUS CLUTCH OF THE WAVERING RIDER AND SO FORTH
TO SEEK THE WHOLESOME DELIGHTS OF EXERTION AND DANGER AND PAIN AND OUR FIRST EXAMINATION OF THE DRAPER REVEALS BENEATH HIS DRAPERIES THE MAN TO WHICH INITIAL FACT AMONG OTHERS WE SHALL COME AGAIN IN THE END
HE HAD INDEED BEEN BUMPED AND BATTERED AT AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF POINTS BUT ENOUGH OF REALISTIC DESCRIPTION IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST
BUT REAL LITERATURE AS DISTINGUISHED FROM ANECDOTE DOES NOT CONCERN ITSELF WITH SUPERFICIAL APPEARANCES ALONE LITERATURE IS REVELATION MODERN LITERATURE IS INDECOROUS REVELATION
CARRY ONE OR TWO LEMONS WITH YOU DON'T TEAR YOURSELF TO DEATH THE FIRST DAY AND SIT UPRIGHT NEVER LOSE CONTROL OF THE MACHINE AND ALWAYS SOUND THE BELL ON EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY YOU MIND THOSE THINGS AND NOTHING VERY MUCH CAN'T HAPPEN TO YOU HOOPDRIVER YOU TAKE MY WORD
AT SUPPER THAT NIGHT HOLIDAY TALK HELD UNDISPUTED SWAY MISTER PRITCHARD SPOKE OF SCOTLAND MISS ISAACS CLAMOURED OF BETTWS
NEVER LET THE MACHINE BUCKLE THERE WAS A MAN KILLED ONLY THE OTHER DAY THROUGH HIS WHEEL BUCKLING DON'T SCORCH DON'T RIDE ON THE FOOT PATH KEEP YOUR OWN SIDE OF THE ROAD AND IF YOU SEE A TRAMLINE GO ROUND THE CORNER AT ONCE AND HURRY OFF INTO THE NEXT COUNTY
CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OTHER ABRASIONS AND CONTUSIONS POINTED UNMISTAKABLY TO THE VIOLENT IMPACT OF THE MOUNTING BEGINNER UPON THE BICYCLING SADDLE AND THAT THE RUINOUS STATE OF THE RIGHT KNEE WAS EQUALLY ELOQUENT
THUS EVEN IN A SHOP ASSISTANT DOES THE WARMTH OF MANHOOD ASSERT ITSELF AND DRIVE HIM AGAINST ALL THE CONDITIONS OF HIS CALLING AGAINST THE COUNSELS OF PRUDENCE AND THE RESTRICTIONS OF HIS MEANS
ARE YOU TIRED HE ASKED I WILL DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE THE TWO BLACK FIGURES IN THE BROKEN LIGHT WERE SILENT FOR A SPACE DO YOU KNOW SHE SAID I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOU I AM SURE YOU ARE HONEST TO ME
HOOPDRIVER RODE OFF INTO DREAMLAND ON HIS MACHINE AND WAS SCARCELY THERE BEFORE HE WAS PITCHED BACK INTO THE WORLD OF SENSE AGAIN SOMETHING WHAT WAS IT NEVER OIL THE STEERING IT'S FATAL
IT IS THE DUTY OF THE EARNEST AUTHOR TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN EVEN AT THE COST OF SOME BLUSHES AND THE THING THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN AND THE THING OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THIS STORY
NOWHERE WAS THE MOON SHINING QUITE SO BRIGHTLY AS IN MISTER HOOPDRIVER'S SKULL AT THE TURNINGS OF THE ROAD HE MADE HIS DECISIONS WITH AN AIR OF PROFOUND PROMPTITUDE AND QUITE HAPHAZARD THE RIGHT HE WOULD SAY OR AGAIN
HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT HER AS SHE SAT BESIDE HIM WITH HER ANKLES GRACEFULLY RULING THE TREADLES NOW THE ROAD TURNED WESTWARD AND SHE WAS A DARK GREY OUTLINE AGAINST THE SHIMMER OF THE MOON
PROMISED TO HELP AND PROTECT ME I WAS UNHAPPY AT HOME NEVER MIND WHY A STEPMOTHER IDLE UNOCCUPIED HINDERED CRAMPED THAT IS ENOUGH PERHAPS THEN HE CAME INTO MY LIFE AND TALKED TO ME OF ART AND LITERATURE AND SET MY BRAIN ON FIRE
AN OTHER GENTLEMEN WHO ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN BROWN SIR WENT INTO THE YARD SIR GOT OUT THE TWO BICYCLES SIR AND WENT OFF SIR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AGO BECHAMEL STOOD WITH HIS EYES ROUND AND HIS KNUCKLE ON HIS HIPS
HOW THEIR HEARTS BEAT TOGETHER AND THEIR BREATH CAME FAST AND HOW EVERY SHADOW WAS ANTICIPATION AND EVERY NOISE PURSUIT FOR ALL THAT FLIGHT MISTER HOOPDRIVER WAS IN THE WORLD OF ROMANCE HAD A POLICEMAN INTERVENED BECAUSE THEIR LAMPS WERE NOT LIT
I'LL CHUCK THIS INFERNAL BUSINESS THEY'VE GONE EIGH YESSIR
AND MIDHURST AND HASLEMERE AND GUILDFORD AND RIPLEY AND PUTNEY AND FOLLOW THIS DEAR FOOL OF A HOOPDRIVER OF OURS AND HIS YOUNG LADY IN GREY OUT UPON THE MOONLIGHT ROAD HOW THEY RODE
HE BANGED THE ARMS OF THE CHAIR WITH HIS FIST AND SWORE AGAIN
OTHERWISE BRIGGS WILL GET NEXT WEEK AND HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER WHEN THE WEATHER IS OFTEN UNCERTAIN HE IS NATURALLY OF A SANGUINE DISPOSITION
AT A FOOTFALL AT A ROUGHNESS IN THE ROAD SHE SEEMED TO BE TOO INTENT UPON ESCAPE TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HIM
NOW IF YOU HAD NOTICED ANYTHING ABOUT HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHIEFLY TO NOTICE HOW LITTLE HE WAS NOTICEABLE HE WORE THE BLACK MORNING COAT THE BLACK TIE AND THE SPECKLED GREY NETHER PARTS DESCENDING INTO SHADOW AND MYSTERY BELOW THE COUNTER OF HIS CRAFT
A GASPING AND GRUNTING A SHOUTING OF STEER MAN STEER A WAVERING UNSTEADY FLIGHT A SPASMODIC TURNING OF THE MISSILE EDIFICE OF MAN AND MACHINE AND A COLLAPSE THEN YOU DESCRY DIMLY THROUGH THE DUSK
AND NOW THEY FACED NORTHWARDS AND THE SOFT COLD LIGHT PASSED CARESSINGLY OVER HER HAIR AND TOUCHED HER BROW AND CHEEK THERE IS A MAGIC QUALITY IN MOONSHINE IT TOUCHES ALL THAT IS SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE REST OF THE NIGHT IS HIDDEN
WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING YOU UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS FOR INSTANCE HATS BABY LINEN GLOVES SILKS LACE OR CURTAINS
AND ABOVE THE KNEE AND ON THE INNER SIDE AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPANSE OF BRUISED SURFACE A KIND OF CLOSELY STIPPLED SHADING OF CONTUSED POINTS
AND ALWAYS LIGHT UP BEFORE DARK YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT HOOPDRIVER AND NOTHING MUCH CAN'T HAPPEN TO YOU YOU TAKE MY WORD RIGHT YOU ARE SAID HOOPDRIVER GOOD NIGHT OLD MAN GOOD NIGHT SAID BRIGGS
WHITE DUST HOT UNDERFOOT BLINDING TO THE EYE IS NOW A SOFT GREY SILENCE WITH THE GLITTER OF A CRYSTAL GRAIN SET STARLIKE IN ITS SILVER HERE AND THERE OVERHEAD RIDING SERENELY THROUGH THE SPACIOUS BLUE IS THE MOTHER OF THE SILENCE
THEY SCARCELY HEEDED WHITHER THEY RODE AT FIRST BEING ONLY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY TURNING ONCE WESTWARD WHEN THE SPIRE OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL ROSE SUDDENLY NEAR THEM OUT OF THE DEWY NIGHT PALE AND INTRICATE AND HIGH
SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE OFF WITH HIM AND THAT LITTLE BUSINESS WAS OVER AND HE WAS HERE STRANDED AND SOLD
BUT THIS WAS LIVING INDEED HE TOLD HIMSELF
INCREDULOUS EYES STARED INTO ONE ANOTHER'S IN THE BAR AS HIS PACES MUFFLED BY THE STAIR CARPET WENT UP TO THE LANDING TURNED REACHED THE PASSAGE AND WALKED INTO THE DINING ROOM OVERHEAD
HOW ABOUT THIS DAY WEEK HOOPDRIVER BECOMES RIGIDLY MEDITATIVE GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE GINGHAM FOLDS IN HIS HANDS HIS FACE IS ELOQUENT OF CONFLICTING CONSIDERATIONS CAN HE LEARN IT IN A WEEK THAT'S THE QUESTION
THE ASSISTANT IS DREAMING OF THE DELICIOUS TIME ONLY FOUR HOURS OFF NOW WHEN HE WILL RESUME THE TALE OF HIS BRUISES AND ABRASIONS THE APPRENTICE IS NEARER THE LONG LONG THOUGHTS OF BOYHOOD AND HIS IMAGINATION RIDES CAP A PIE
AND MAKING A KIND OF CIRCULAR SWEEP INVITED YOU TO STEP THIS WAY AND SO LED YOU BEYOND HIS KEN
HIS MIND BECAME AN ENORMOUS APPRECIATION OF THE POSITION THE NIGHT WAS A WARM WHITE SILENCE SAVE FOR THE SUBTILE RUNNING OF THEIR CHAINS
BUT THAT NIGHT HE WAS IN THE MOOD TO DARE ANYTHING SO YOU FOUND YOUR YOUNG LADY AT LAST SAID THE OSTLER OF THE RED HOTEL
EVEN IN LITERATURE ONE MUST KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE NOW THE READER MAY BE INCLINED TO WONDER HOW A RESPECTABLE YOUNG SHOPMAN
I AM ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE I WILL HELP YOU WITH ALL MY POWER I HAVE LOST AN ILLUSION AND FOUND A KNIGHT ERRANT SHE SPOKE OF BECHAMEL AS THE ILLUSION MISTER HOOPDRIVER FELT FLATTERED BUT HE HAD NO ADEQUATE ANSWER
I'M GETTING FAIRLY SAFE UPON IT NOW HE TOLD MISS HOWE AT OTHER TIMES HOOPDRIVER MIGHT HAVE FURTHER RESENTED THE SATIRICAL EFFORTS OF THE APPRENTICE BUT HIS MIND WAS TOO FULL OF THE PROJECTED TOUR TO ADMIT ANY PETTY DELICACIES OF DIGNITY
UNTIL SHERLOCK IS PRESENTLY EXPLAINING BY THE HELP OF THE MINOR INJURIES THAT THE MACHINE RIDDEN IS AN OLD FASHIONED AFFAIR WITH A FORK INSTEAD OF THE DIAMOND FRAME A CUSHIONED TIRE WELL WORN ON THE HIND WHEEL
OF THE CONCUSSIONS ATTENDANT ON THAT PERSON'S HASTY FREQUENTLY CAUSELESS AND INVARIABLY ILL CONCEIVED DESCENTS ONE LARGE BRUISE ON THE SHIN IS EVEN MORE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRENTICE CYCLIST
THE RIGHT LEG WOULD BE FOUND TO BE BRUISED IN A MARVELLOUS MANNER ALL ABOUT AND UNDER THE KNEE AND PARTICULARLY ON THE INTERIOR ASPECT OF THE KNEE SO FAR WE MAY PROCEED WITH OUR DETAILS
THEY LISTENED TOGETHER HIS FEET STOPPED TURNED WENT OUT OF THE DININGROOM DOWN THE PASSAGE TO THE BEDROOM STOPPED AGAIN POOR CHAP SAID THE BARMAID SHE'S A WICKED WOMAN SSSH SAID STEPHEN
AS WITHOUT KNOCKING STEPHEN ENTERED BECHAMEL'S FACE SUGGESTED A DIFFERENT EXPECTATION BEG PARDON SIR SAID STEPHEN WITH A DIPLOMATIC COUGH WELL SAID BECHAMEL WONDERING SUDDENLY IF JESSIE HAD KEPT SOME OF HER THREATS
I SUPPOSE YOU WON'T TAKE ANYTHING JESSIE THE GLORY OF HAVING HER EVEN AS A SISTER AND TO CALL HER JESSIE LIKE THAT BUT HE CARRIED IT OFF SPLENDIDLY AS HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO ADMIT GOOD NIGHT SIS HE SAID AND PLEASANT DREAMS
KNICKERBOCKERS WENT FRISKING ACROSS HIS MIND AGAIN AND HE REVERTED TO HIS BLASPHEMIES HE STARTED UP IN A GUSTY FRENZY WITH A VAGUE IDEA OF PURSUIT AND INCONTINENTLY SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH A CONCUSSION THAT STIRRED THE BAR BELOW TO ITS DEPTHS
YOU ARE SAFE SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER SWEEPING OFF HIS CAP WITH AN AIR AND BOWING COURTLY WHERE ARE WE SAFE BUT WHERE CHICHESTER HARBOUR HE WAVED HIS ARM SEAWARD AS THOUGH IT WAS A GOAL DO YOU THINK THEY WILL FOLLOW US
HAVE SCRIBBLED A STILL MORE FLOURISHING J M ALL OVER THE DOCUMENT HAVE ASKED YOU IF THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HAVE STOOD BY YOU SUPPOSING THAT YOU WERE PAYING CASH UNTIL THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY REAPPEARED WITH THE CHANGE
THAT GAVE THE FUGITIVES FIVE MINUTES THEN PUSHING BREATHLESSLY INTO THE BAR HE HAD TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE BARMAID WHAT THE MATTER WAS AND THE GOV'NOR BEING OUT THEY SPENT SOME MORE PRECIOUS TIME WONDERING WHAT EVER WAS TO BE DONE
WAS SITTING UP IN BED AND TRYING TO SMOKE IN THE DARK BRIGGS HAD NEVER BEEN ON A CYCLE IN HIS LIFE BUT HE FELT HOOPDRIVER'S INEXPERIENCE AND OFFERED SUCH ADVICE AS OCCURRED TO HIM HAVE THE MACHINE THOROUGHLY WELL OILED SAID BRIGGS
THEN STEPHEN THE WAITER WHO HAD SHOWN HOOPDRIVER UP CAME DOWN AND LIT WONDERFUL LIGHTS AND STARTED QUITE A FRESH DISCUSSION BY THE SIMPLE QUESTION WHICH THAT TURNED TEN MINUTES INTO A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS DISCUSSION
HE ROSE WITH A FINE SURPRISE GONE HE SAID WITH A HALF LAUGH GONE SIR ON HER BICYCLE ON HER BICYCLE WHY SHE WENT SIR WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN THIS TIME BECHAMEL WAS REALLY STARTLED
A PERFECTLY FICTITIOUS CO BY THE BYE OF PUTNEY ON THE FOURTEENTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE HAD TURNED TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE THE BLOCKS OF WHITE LINEN AND PILES OF BLANKETS RISE UP TO THE RAIL FROM WHICH THE PINK AND BLUE PRINTS DEPEND
UNDER WHICH HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MIGHT IF OF AN OBSERVING TURN OF MIND AND NOT TOO MUCH OF A HOUSEWIFE TO BE INHUMAN HAVE GIVEN THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY LESS CURSORY ATTENTION
MAKING A SUDDEN AND AWESTRICKEN SILENCE APPEARED BECHAMEL IN THE HALL BEYOND THE BAR WALKED WITH A RESOLUTE AIR TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND PASSED OUT OF SIGHT YOU CONCEIVE THE BACKWARD PITCH OF THAT EXCEPTIONALLY SHAPED CRANIUM
AFTER A PAUSE BECHAMEL WENT BACK TO THE DINING ROOM THEY HEARD A CHAIR CREAK UNDER HIM INTERLUDE OF CONVERSATIONAL EYEBROWS I'M GOING UP SAID STEPHEN TO BREAK THE MELANCHOLY NEWS TO HIM BECHAMEL LOOKED UP FROM A WEEK OLD NEWSPAPER
HE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHAME OF HIS HOMELY PATRONYMIC IT'S AN UGLY NAME HE SAID BUT YOU ARE RIGHT IN TRUSTING ME I WOULD I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU THIS
ONE MIGHT FANCY THAT HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS NETHER EXTREMITIES IN SOME COMPLICATED MACHINERY A THRESHING MACHINE SAY OR ONE OF THOSE HAY MAKING FURIES BUT SHERLOCK HOLMES
ALMOST KNEELING IN FRONT OF HER WITH AN UNREASONABLE APPROBATION IN HER EYES IT WAS AS I HAVE INDICATED THE HOUR AND SEASON OF THE FULL MOON
ONE GLANCE MORE AT HIM AND THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE BEEN BOWING YOU OUT WITH FOUNTAINS OF CIVILITIES AT WORK ALL ABOUT YOU
RISES A VISION OF A NIGHTLY STRUGGLE OF TWO DARK FIGURES AND A MACHINE IN A DARK ROAD THE ROAD TO BE EXPLICIT FROM ROEHAMPTON TO PUTNEY HILL AND WITH THIS VISION IS THE SOUND OF A HEEL SPURNING THE GRAVEL
IF SO HE WAS IN FOR AN EXPLANATION BUT HE HAD IT READY SHE WAS A MONOMANIAC LEAVE ME ALONE WITH HER HE WOULD SAY I KNOW HOW TO CALM HER MISSUS BEAUMONT SAID STEPHEN WELL HAS GONE
WHEN THE GAS WAS TURNED OFF FOR THE NIGHT HE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED RUBBING ARNICA INTO HIS KNEE A NEW AND VERY BIG PLACE AND STUDYING A ROAD MAP OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
THE OSTLER BEING A FOOL RUSHED VIOLENTLY DOWN THE ROAD VOCIFERATING AFTER THEM THEN HE RETURNED PANTING TO THE VICUNA HOTEL AND FINDING A GROUP OF MEN OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS UP STOPPED TO GIVE THEM THE CREAM OF THE ADVENTURE
THE NEXT IN THE STRICT SCALE OF PRECEDENCE OF THE DRAPERY EMPORIUM MISTER HOOPDRIVER IN ALTERNATING SPASMS ANON STRAIGHTENS HIS GINGHAM AND ANON BECOMES MEDITATIVE WITH HIS TONGUE IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS DECAYING WISDOM TOOTH
WHO WOULD BE HOOPDRIVER ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS BUT THE CHRISTIAN NAME CHRISTIAN NAME MY CHRISTIAN NAME WELL CHRIS HE SNAPPED HIS LAMP AND STOOD UP IF YOU WILL HOLD MY MACHINE I WILL LIGHT YOURS HE SAID
THERE WERE ALSO MORAL REMARKS AND OTHER IRRELEVANT CONTRIBUTIONS THERE WERE CONFLICTING IDEAS OF TELLING THE POLICE AND PURSUING THE FLYING COUPLE ON A HORSE THAT MADE TEN MINUTES
A RUDDY RED HAIRED LAD IN A VERY SHORT TAILLESS BLACK COAT AND A VERY HIGH COLLAR WHO IS DELIBERATELY UNFOLDING AND REFOLDING SOME PATTERNS OF CRETONNE
I SAID HOOPDRIVER WHEN THE QUESTION CAME TO HIM WHY CYCLING OF COURSE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO RIDE THAT DREADFUL MACHINE OF YOURS DAY AFTER DAY SAID MISS HOWE OF THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT I AM
YOU STOW IT SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER LOOKING HARD AND THREATENINGLY AT THE JUNIOR APPRENTICE AND SUDDENLY ADDING IN A TONE OF BITTER CONTEMPT
AND GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE FOLDS IN HIS HANDS BEGINS TO STRAIGHTEN THEM PUNCTILIOUSLY NEAR HIM IS AN APPRENTICE APPRENTICED TO THE SAME HIGH CALLING OF DRAPER'S ASSISTANT
HE HAD SEEN HER TROUBLED AND HER EYES BRIGHT WITH TEARS BUT WHAT LIGHT IS THERE LIGHTING A FACE LIKE HERS TO COMPARE WITH THE SOFT GLAMOUR OF THE MIDSUMMER MOON THE ROAD TURNED NORTHWARD GOING ROUND THROUGH THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGNOR
WE HAVE TURNED AND TURNED AGAIN IT SEEMED TO HOOPDRIVER THAT HE HEARD HER SOB SHE STOOD DIMLY THERE HOLDING HER MACHINE AND HE HOLDING HIS COULD GO NO NEARER TO HER TO SEE IF SHE SOBBED FOR WEEPING OR FOR WANT OF BREATH
ALL DRAPERS HAVE TO BE OR ELSE THEY COULD NEVER HAVE THE FAITH THEY SHOW IN THE BEAUTY WASHABILITY AND UNFADING EXCELLENCE OF THE GOODS THEY SELL YOU THE DECISION COMES AT LAST
IT HAS CREATED THE FAIRIES WHOM THE SUNLIGHT KILLS AND FAIRYLAND RISES AGAIN IN OUR HEARTS AT THE SIGHT OF IT THE VOICES OF THE FILMY ROUTE
THEN WITH INFINITE FERVOUR HE SAID BUT LET US PUT IN BLANK CARTRIDGE HE SAID I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HE FLUNG HIMSELF INTO THE ARMCHAIR DAMN HER SAID BECHAMEL FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A COMMON MAN
AND SO TO OUR REVELATION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE RIGHT ANKLE OF THIS YOUNG MAN YOU WOULD HAVE OBSERVED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN A CONTUSION AND AN ABRASION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE LEFT ANKLE A CONTUSION ALSO
TO BE A HUMAN BEING NOT A THING IN A HUTCH AND HE I KNOW SAID HOOPDRIVER AND NOW HERE I AM I WILL DO ANYTHING SAID HOOPDRIVER SHE THOUGHT YOU CANNOT IMAGINE MY STEPMOTHER NO I COULD NOT DESCRIBE HER
THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTER IN THE STORY IF YOU PRESUMING YOU ARE OF THE SEX THAT DOES SUCH THINGS IF YOU HAD GONE INTO THE DRAPERY EMPORIUM WHICH IS REALLY ONLY MAGNIFICENT FOR SHOP
STEPHEN WAS TOO SURPRISED TO SAY ANYTHING BUT BOURBON SIR GO ON SAID BECHAMEL DAMN YOU STEPHEN'S SYMPATHIES CHANGED AT ONCE YESSIR HE MURMURED FUMBLING FOR THE DOOR HANDLE AND LEFT THE ROOM MARVELLING
HOOPDRIVER HAD CUT HIM DOWN AND RIDDEN ON AFTER THE FASHION OF A HERO BORN HAD BECHAMEL ARISEN IN THE WAY WITH RAPIERS FOR A DUEL HOOPDRIVER HAD FOUGHT AS ONE TO WHOM AGINCOURT WAS A REALITY AND DRAPERY A DREAM
MAKING A MEMORABLE SAYING LET EM GO WHO CARES AND I WISH HIM LUCK AND BRING ME SOME BOURBON AS FAST AS YOU CAN THERE'S A GOOD CHAP
AND IT WAS CHIEFLY BY GOOD LUCK AND THE FACT THAT MOST ROADS ABOUT A TOWN CONVERGE THEREUPON THAT CHICHESTER WAS AT LAST ATTAINED IT SEEMED AT FIRST AS THOUGH EVERYONE HAD GONE TO BED BUT THE RED HOTEL STILL GLOWED YELLOW AND WARM
I HELD MY HEAD IN BOTH HANDS TO KEEP IT FROM BURSTING I CLOSED MY EYES I NO LONGER WANTED TO THINK A HALF HOUR STILL TO WAIT A HALF HOUR OF NIGHTMARES THAT COULD DRIVE ME INSANE
WE'LL ESCAPE TONIGHT EVEN IF THE SEA SWALLOWS US UP THE SEA'S ROUGH THE WIND'S BLOWING HARD BUT A TWENTY MILE RUN IN THE NAUTILUS'S NIMBLE LONGBOAT DOESN'T SCARE ME UNKNOWN TO THE CREW I'VE STOWED SOME FOOD AND FLASKS OF WATER INSIDE
FOUND HE HAD NO ARMS AND CURVING HIS MUTILATED BODY JUMPED INTO THE SEA WHAT HAD BEEN HIS LEGS BECAME THE TWO ENDS OF A CRESCENT SHAPED TAIL THE WHOLE CREW BECAME DOLPHINS AND SWAM ABOUT THE SHIP
WE WERE RACING NORTH NORTHEAST WITH FRIGHTFUL SPEED FIFTY METERS DOWN I TOOK ONE LAST LOOK AT THE NATURAL WONDERS AND ARTISTIC TREASURES AMASSED IN THE MUSEUM THIS UNRIVALED COLLECTION DOOMED TO PERISH SOMEDAY IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEAS
THEY PROMISED SO TO DO AND TOLD ME TO PILOT THE SHIP TO NAXOS NAXOS LAY TO THE RIGHT AND I WAS TRIMMING THE SAILS TO CARRY US THERE WHEN SOME BY SIGNS AND OTHERS BY WHISPERS SIGNIFIED TO ME THEIR WILL
THERE HE CLOTHED HIMSELF IN HIS SPLENDORS NOT PUTTING ON ALL HIS TERRORS AS WHEN HE OVERTHREW THE GIANTS BUT WHAT IS KNOWN AMONG THE GODS AS HIS LESSER PANOPLY ARRAYED IN THIS HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER OF SEMELE
THIS SHIP SHALL NOT BE PROFANED BY SUCH IMPIETY SAID I I HAVE A GREATER SHARE IN HER THAN ANY OF YOU BUT LYCABAS A TURBULENT FELLOW SEIZED ME BY THE THROAT AND ATTEMPTED TO THROW ME OVERBOARD
WHOSE CHARMED CUP WHOEVER TASTED LOST HIS UPRIGHT SHAPE AND DOWNWARD FELL INTO A GROVELLING SWINE ARIADNE
WHATEVER HE HAD ONCE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF HUMANITY HE HAD NO RIGHT TO METE OUT SUCH PUNISHMENT HE HAD MADE ME IF NOT AN ACCOMPLICE AT LEAST AN EYEWITNESS TO HIS VENGEANCE EVEN THIS WAS INTOLERABLE
BUT PERHAPS I'M MISTAKEN THAT THE NAUTILUS'S HAPHAZARD COURSE CONTINUED FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY DAYS AND I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG THIS WOULD HAVE GONE ON WITHOUT THE CATASTROPHE THAT ENDED OUR VOYAGE AS FOR CAPTAIN NEMO HE WAS NO LONGER IN THE PICTURE
I WAS SLUMBERING NEAR THE FIRST HOURS OF DAYLIGHT A PAINFUL SICKLY SLUMBER WAKING UP I SAW NED LAND LEANING OVER ME AND I HEARD HIM TELL ME IN A LOW VOICE WE'RE GOING TO ESCAPE I SAT UP
TEACHING THE PEOPLE THE CULTIVATION OF THE VINE THE MOST FAMOUS PART OF HIS WANDERINGS IS HIS EXPEDITION TO INDIA WHICH IS SAID TO HAVE LASTED SEVERAL YEARS RETURNING IN TRIUMPH HE UNDERTOOK TO INTRODUCE HIS WORSHIP INTO GREECE
AT SIX THIRTY NED LAND ENTERED MY STATEROOM HE TOLD ME WE WON'T SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN BEFORE WE GO AT TEN O'CLOCK THE MOON WON'T BE UP YET WE'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DARKNESS
ITS STEEL MUSCLES WERE CRACKING SOMETIMES IT STOOD ON END THE THREE OF US ALONG WITH IT WE'VE GOT TO HOLD ON TIGHT NED SAID AND SCREW THE NUTS DOWN AGAIN IF WE CAN STAY ATTACHED TO THE NAUTILUS WE CAN STILL MAKE IT
WHAT WAS IT HAD THEY SPOTTED OUR ESCAPE I FELT NED LAND SLIDING A DAGGER INTO MY HAND YES I MUTTERED WE KNOW HOW TO DIE THE CANADIAN PAUSED IN HIS WORK
THE GOD WOULD HAVE STOPPED HER AS SHE SPAKE BUT SHE WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM THE WORDS ESCAPED AND HE COULD NEITHER UNSAY HIS PROMISE NOR HER REQUEST IN DEEP DISTRESS HE LEFT HER AND RETURNED TO THE UPPER REGIONS
THAT OUR HEADING WOULD TAKE US TO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS WITH INCOMPARABLE SPEED I COULD BARELY GLIMPSE THE SWIFT PASSING OF LONGNOSE SHARKS HAMMERHEAD SHARKS SPOTTED DOGFISH THAT FREQUENT THESE WATERS
I LEARNED THE PILOT'S ART AND HOW TO GUIDE MY COURSE BY THE STARS IT HAPPENED AS I WAS SAILING FOR DELOS WE TOUCHED AT THE ISLAND OF DIA AND WENT ASHORE NEXT MORNING I SENT THE MEN FOR FRESH WATER
SOME LEAPED OVERBOARD OTHERS PREPARING TO DO THE SAME BEHELD THEIR COMPANIONS IN THE WATER UNDERGOING A CHANGE THEIR BODIES BECOMING FLATTENED AND ENDING IN A CROOKED TAIL ONE EXCLAIMED WHAT MIRACLE IS THIS
WHERE TREE TRUNKS ARE WORN DOWN AND WORKED INTO A SHAGGY FUR AS NORWEGIANS EXPRESS IT WHAT A PREDICAMENT WE WERE ROCKING FRIGHTFULLY THE NAUTILUS DEFENDED ITSELF LIKE A HUMAN BEING
AND I SCARCELY SAVED MYSELF BY CLINGING TO THE ROPES THE REST APPROVED THE DEED THEN BACCHUS FOR IT WAS INDEED HE AS IF SHAKING OFF HIS DROWSINESS EXCLAIMED WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH ME WHAT IS THIS FIGHTING ABOUT WHO BROUGHT ME HERE
AND BETWEEN THEM HE WAS TORN TO PIECES WHILE HIS MOTHER SHOUTED VICTORY VICTORY WE HAVE DONE IT THE GLORY IS OURS SO THE WORSHIP OF BACCHUS WAS ESTABLISHED IN GREECE
I LISTENED WITH ALL MY SENSES AT ONCE
TOGETHER WITH ITS CURATOR I WANTED TO ESTABLISH ONE SUPREME IMPRESSION IN MY MIND I STAYED THERE AN HOUR BASKING IN THE AURA OF THE CEILING LIGHTS PASSING IN REVIEW THE TREASURES SHINING IN THEIR GLASS CASES
FORTUNATELY I CONTROLLED MYSELF AND STRETCHED OUT ON THE BED TO SOOTHE MY BODILY AGITATION MY NERVES CALMED A LITTLE BUT WITH MY BRAIN SO AROUSED I DID A SWIFT REVIEW OF MY WHOLE EXISTENCE ABOARD THE NAUTILUS
HER MORTAL FRAME COULD NOT ENDURE THE SPLENDORS OF THE IMMORTAL RADIANCE SHE WAS CONSUMED TO ASHES JOVE TOOK THE INFANT BACCHUS AND GAVE HIM IN CHARGE
OUR IMPRISONMENT IN THE ICE THE BATTLE WITH THE DEVILFISH THE STORM IN THE GULF STREAM THE AVENGER AND THAT HORRIBLE SCENE OF THE VESSEL SINKING WITH ITS CREW
BETWEEN THE KNEELING HERCULES AND THE MAN WHO HOLDS THE SERPENT SPENSER ALLUDES TO ARIADNE'S CROWN THOUGH HE HAS MADE SOME MISTAKES IN HIS MYTHOLOGY IT WAS AT THE WEDDING OF PIRITHOUS AND NOT THESEUS
BEARING CYMBALS FLUTES AND THYRSES WILD FROM NAXIAN GROVES OF ZANTE'S VINEYARDS SING DELIRIOUS VERSES IT WAS IN VAIN PENTHEUS REMONSTRATED COMMANDED AND THREATENED
THEY FORM A WHIRLPOOL APTLY CALLED THE OCEAN'S NAVEL WHOSE ATTRACTING POWER EXTENDS A DISTANCE OF FIFTEEN KILOMETERS IT CAN SUCK DOWN NOT ONLY SHIPS BUT WHALES AND EVEN POLAR BEARS FROM THE NORTHERNMOST REGIONS
WITH HIS EVERY MOVEMENT I IMAGINED HE WOULD APPEAR AND ASK ME WHY I WANTED TO ESCAPE I FELT IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF ALARM MY IMAGINATION MAGNIFIED THIS SENSATION THE FEELING BECAME SO ACUTE
ALL THESE EVENTS PASSED BEFORE MY EYES LIKE BACKDROPS UNROLLING UPSTAGE IN A THEATER
THE GULF OF OB THE LYAKHOV ISLANDS OR THOSE UNKNOWN BEACHES ON THE SIBERIAN COAST I'M UNABLE TO SAY I LOST TRACK OF THE PASSING HOURS TIME WAS IN ABEYANCE ON THE SHIP'S CLOCKS
THAT THE CENTAURS AND LAPITHAE QUARRELLED LOOK HOW THE CROWN WHICH ARIADNE WORE UPON HER IVORY FOREHEAD THAT SAME DAY THAT THESEUS HER UNTO HIS BRIDAL BORE
CONSEIL COULDN'T COAX A SINGLE WORD OUT OF HIM AND FEARED THAT IN A FIT OF DELIRIUM WHILE UNDER THE SWAY OF A GHASTLY HOMESICKNESS NED WOULD KILL HIMSELF SO HE KEPT A DEVOTED WATCH ON HIS FRIEND EVERY INSTANT
THERE IS AN ALLUSION TO THE STORY OF BACCHUS AND THE MARINERS IN MILTON'S COMUS AT LINE FORTY SIX
BLINDED BY THE GOD CRIED OUT SEE THERE THE WILD BOAR THE HUGEST MONSTER THAT PROWLS IN THESE WOODS COME ON SISTERS I WILL BE THE FIRST TO STRIKE THE WILD BOAR THE WHOLE BAND RUSHED UPON HIM AND WHILE HE NOW TALKS LESS ARROGANTLY
SOMETIMES ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA SOMETIMES THIRTY FEET BENEATH IT AFTER OUR POSITION HAD BEEN MARKED ON THE CHART I SAW THAT WE WERE PASSING INTO THE MOUTH OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
AND AS HE SPOKE HIS MOUTH WIDENED HIS NOSTRILS EXPANDED AND SCALES COVERED ALL HIS BODY ANOTHER ENDEAVORING TO PULL THE OAR FELT HIS HANDS SHRINK UP AND PRESENTLY TO BE NO LONGER HANDS BUT FINS
IT WAS BEST NOT TO MEET HIM FACE TO FACE BEST TO TRY AND FORGET HIM AND YET HOW LONG THAT DAY SEEMED THE LAST I WOULD SPEND ABOARD THE NAUTILUS I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF
NOW UPON THE SURFACE NOW UNDER IT SCATTERING THE SPRAY AND SPOUTING THE WATER FROM THEIR BROAD NOSTRILS OF TWENTY MEN I ALONE WAS LEFT TREMBLING WITH FEAR THE GOD CHEERED ME FEAR NOT SAID HE STEER TOWARDS NAXOS
IT WAS IN VAIN HIS NEAREST FRIENDS AND WISEST COUNSELLORS REMONSTRATED AND BEGGED HIM NOT TO OPPOSE THE GOD THEIR REMONSTRANCES ONLY MADE HIM MORE VIOLENT
YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS OUR SITUATION HAD BECOME UNTENABLE ONE MORNING WHOSE DATE I'M UNABLE TO SPECIFY
HIS FEATURES WERE ACCENTUATED TAKING ON SUPERHUMAN PROPORTIONS HE WAS NO LONGER MY EQUAL HE WAS THE MAN OF THE WATERS THE SPIRIT OF THE SEAS BY THEN IT WAS NINE THIRTY
AS FOR HIS CHIEF OFFICER THE SAME APPLIED NOT ONE CREWMAN WAS VISIBLE FOR A SINGLE INSTANT THE NAUTILUS CRUISED BENEATH THE WATERS ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY WHEN IT ROSE BRIEFLY TO THE SURFACE TO RENEW OUR AIR
THE HATCHES OPENED AND CLOSED AS IF AUTOMATED NO MORE POSITIONS WERE REPORTED ON THE WORLD MAP I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WERE I'LL ALSO MENTION THAT THE CANADIAN AT THE END OF HIS STRENGTH AND PATIENCE MADE NO FURTHER APPEARANCES
THE PRISONER UNTERRIFIED RESPONDED
JUST THEN I HEARD INDISTINCT CHORDS FROM THE ORGAN MELANCHOLY HARMONIES FROM SOME UNDEFINABLE HYMN ACTUAL PLEADINGS FROM A SOUL TRYING TO SEVER ITS EARTHLY TIES
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS CAME BACK ON I WENT INTO THE LOUNGE IT WAS DESERTED I CONSULTED THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS THE NAUTILUS WAS FLEEING NORTHWARD AT A SPEED OF TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR
BUT NOW THE ATTENDANTS RETURNED WHOM HE HAD DESPATCHED TO SEIZE BACCHUS THEY HAD BEEN DRIVEN AWAY BY THE BACCHANALS BUT HAD SUCCEEDED IN TAKING ONE OF THEM PRISONER WHOM WITH HIS HANDS TIED BEHIND HIM
THE GOD HIMSELF HAD A CHAPLET OF VINE LEAVES AND BORE IN HIS HAND A SPEAR WREATHED WITH IVY TIGERS CROUCHED AT HIS FEET AND FORMS OF LYNXES AND SPOTTED PANTHERS PLAYED AROUND HIM THE MEN WERE SEIZED WITH TERROR OR MADNESS
WHEN I ASKED TONIGHT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY SUPERVISION LEFT ON THE NAUTILUS YOU'D THINK A TOTAL DAZE WAS REIGNING ON BOARD WILL YOU BE READY SIR YES WHERE ARE WE
THAT I SHOULD SAIL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND TAKE THE BOY TO EGYPT TO SELL HIM FOR A SLAVE I WAS CONFOUNDED AND SAID LET SOME ONE ELSE PILOT THE SHIP WITHDRAWING MYSELF FROM ANY FURTHER AGENCY IN THEIR WICKEDNESS THEY CURSED ME AND ONE OF THEM EXCLAIMING
WHERE WOULD THE MAN FLEE AFTER THIS HORRIBLE ACT OF REVENGE I REENTERED MY STATEROOM WHERE NED AND CONSEIL WERE WAITING SILENTLY
AND MELANTHUS MY STEERSMAN AND EPOPEUS THE LEADER OF THE SAILOR'S CRY ONE AND ALL EXCLAIMED SPARE YOUR PRAYERS FOR US SO BLIND IS THE LUST OF GAIN WHEN THEY PROCEEDED TO PUT HIM ON BOARD I RESISTED THEM
HE PENETRATED THROUGH THE WOOD AND REACHED AN OPEN SPACE WHERE THE CHIEF SCENE OF THE ORGIES MET HIS EYES AT THE SAME MOMENT THE WOMEN SAW HIM
WHO NOURISHED HIS INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD AND FOR THEIR CARE WERE REWARDED BY JUPITER BY BEING PLACED AS THE HYADES AMONG THE STARS WHEN BACCHUS GREW UP HE DISCOVERED THE CULTURE OF THE VINE AND THE MODE OF EXTRACTING ITS PRECIOUS JUICE
I OBEYED AND WHEN WE ARRIVED THERE I KINDLED THE ALTARS AND CELEBRATED THE SACRED RITES OF BACCHUS PENTHEUS HERE EXCLAIMED WE HAVE WASTED TIME ENOUGH ON THIS SILLY STORY TAKE HIM AWAY AND HAVE HIM EXECUTED WITHOUT DELAY
THE ISLAND WHERE ARIADNE WAS LEFT WAS THE FAVORITE ISLAND OF BACCHUS THE SAME THAT HE WISHED
INSIDE THE NAUTILUS ALL WAS GLOOM AND SILENCE IT LEFT THIS PLACE OF DEVASTATION WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED ONE HUNDRED FEET BENEATH THE WATERS WHERE WAS IT GOING NORTH OR SOUTH
ENOUGH ENOUGH WAS IT A VOW OF REPENTANCE THAT HAD JUST ESCAPED FROM THIS MAN'S CONSCIENCE FRANTIC I RUSHED INTO THE LIBRARY
THE CORAL CEMETERY THE SUEZ PASSAGEWAY THE ISLAND OF SANTORINI THE CRETAN DIVER THE BAY OF VIGO ATLANTIS THE ICE BANK THE SOUTH POLE
MY COUNTRY IS MAEONIA MY PARENTS WERE POOR PEOPLE WHO HAD NO FIELDS OR FLOCKS TO LEAVE ME BUT THEY LEFT ME THEIR FISHING RODS AND NETS AND THEIR FISHERMAN'S TRADE THIS I FOLLOWED FOR SOME TIME TILL GROWING WEARY OF REMAINING IN ONE PLACE
AFTER LIKEWISE CLOSING THE OPENING IN THE SKIFF THE CANADIAN BEGAN TO UNSCREW THE NUTS STILL BOLTING US TO THE UNDERWATER BOAT SUDDENLY A NOISE FROM THE SHIP'S INTERIOR BECAME AUDIBLE VOICES WERE ANSWERING EACH OTHER HURRIEDLY
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE BACCHUS ARIADNE BACCHUS BACCHUS WAS THE SON OF JUPITER AND SEMELE
PERHAPS SPEAK TO ME ONE GESTURE FROM HIM COULD OBLITERATE ME A SINGLE WORD SHACKLE ME TO HIS VESSEL EVEN SO TEN O'CLOCK WAS ABOUT TO STRIKE IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE MY STATEROOM AND REJOIN MY COMPANIONS
I EXPECTED ANY MOMENT TO SEE THAT SHROUDED HUMAN FIGURE VERY FAR LARGER IN ITS PROPORTIONS THAN ANY DWELLER AMONG MEN THROWN ACROSS THE CATARACT THAT PROTECTS THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE POLE I ESTIMATE
AND WHAT A NOISE AROUND OUR FRAIL SKIFF WHAT ROARS ECHOING FROM SEVERAL MILES AWAY WHAT CRASHES FROM THE WATERS BREAKING AGAINST SHARP ROCKS ON THE SEAFLOOR WHERE THE HARDEST OBJECTS ARE SMASHED
EVERY PLEASANT OR UNPLEASANT INCIDENT THAT HAD CROSSED MY PATH SINCE I WENT OVERBOARD FROM THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN THE UNDERWATER HUNTING TRIP THE TORRES STRAIT OUR RUNNING AGROUND THE SAVAGES OF PAPUA
THE LOUNGE WAS PLUNGED IN PROFOUND DARKNESS CHORDS FROM THE ORGAN WERE REVERBERATING FAINTLY CAPTAIN NEMO WAS THERE HE DIDN'T SEE ME
FROM THAT DAY FORWARD WHO KNOWS WHERE THE NAUTILUS TOOK US IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC BASIN ALWAYS AT INCALCULABLE SPEED ALWAYS AMID THE HIGH ARCTIC MISTS
WE HAVE SEEN IN THE STORY OF THESEUS HOW ARIADNE THE DAUGHTER OF KING MINOS AFTER HELPING THESEUS TO ESCAPE FROM THE LABYRINTH WAS CARRIED BY HIM TO THE ISLAND OF NAXOS
BUT ONE WORD TWENTY TIMES REPEATED ONE DREADFUL WORD TOLD ME THE REASON FOR THE AGITATION SPREADING ABOARD THE NAUTILUS WE WEREN'T THE CAUSE OF THE CREW'S CONCERN MAELSTROM MAELSTROM
THE SKIFF STILL ATTACHED TO THE SHIP'S PLATING WAS LIKEWISE CARRIED AROUND AT DIZZYING SPEED I COULD FEEL US WHIRLING I WAS EXPERIENCING THAT ACCOMPANYING NAUSEA
THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT TERRIFIED ME CAPTAIN NEMO HAD LEFT HIS STATEROOM HE WAS IN THE SAME LOUNGE I HAD TO CROSS IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THERE I WOULD ENCOUNTER HIM ONE LAST TIME HE WOULD SEE ME
THAT FOLLOWS SUCH CONTINUOUS SPINNING MOTIONS WE WERE IN DREAD IN THE LAST STAGES OF SHEER HORROR
BACCHUS THAT FIRST FROM OUT THE PURPLE GRAPES CRUSHED THE SWEET POISON OF MISUSED WINE AFTER THE TUSCAN MANNERS TRANSFORMED COASTING THE TYRRHENE SHORE AS THE WINDS LISTED ON CIRCE'S ISLAND FELL
JUNO TO GRATIFY HER RESENTMENT AGAINST SEMELE CONTRIVED A PLAN FOR HER DESTRUCTION ASSUMING THE FORM OF BEROE HER AGED NURSE SHE INSINUATED DOUBTS WHETHER IT WAS INDEED JOVE HIMSELF WHO CAME AS A LOVER
LOOKED OUT OVER THE SEA AND SAID IN A VOICE OF WEEPING SAILORS THESE ARE NOT THE SHORES YOU PROMISED TO TAKE ME TO YONDER ISLAND IS NOT MY HOME WHAT HAVE I DONE THAT YOU SHOULD TREAT ME SO
AND MYSELF MOUNTED THE HILL TO OBSERVE THE WIND WHEN MY MEN RETURNED BRINGING WITH THEM A PRIZE AS THEY THOUGHT A BOY OF DELICATE APPEARANCE WHOM THEY HAD FOUND ASLEEP THEY JUDGED HE WAS A NOBLE YOUTH PERHAPS A KING'S SON
NOT WALKING BUT GLIDING LIKE A GHOST HIS CHEST WAS HEAVING SWELLING WITH SOBS AND I HEARD HIM MURMUR THESE WORDS THE LAST OF HIS TO REACH MY EARS O ALMIGHTY GOD
THIS WAS WHERE THE NAUTILUS HAD BEEN SENT ACCIDENTALLY OR PERHAPS DELIBERATELY BY ITS CAPTAIN IT WAS SWEEPING AROUND IN A SPIRAL WHOSE RADIUS KEPT GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
WHO HAD NO RESPECT FOR THE NEW WORSHIP FORBADE ITS RITES TO BE PERFORMED BUT WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT BACCHUS WAS ADVANCING MEN AND WOMEN BUT CHIEFLY THE LATTER YOUNG AND OLD POURED FORTH TO MEET HIM AND TO JOIN HIS TRIUMPHAL MARCH
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO CARRY ME ONE OF THEM REPLIED FEAR NOTHING TELL US WHERE YOU WISH TO GO AND WE WILL TAKE YOU THERE NAXOS IS MY HOME SAID BACCHUS TAKE ME THERE AND YOU SHALL BE WELL REWARDED
EVEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HAVE NOTICED ME SO COMPLETELY WAS HE IMMERSED IN HIS TRANCE I INCHED OVER THE CARPET AVOIDING THE TINIEST BUMP WHOSE NOISE MIGHT GIVE ME AWAY
WAS THE NAUTILUS BEING DRAGGED INTO THIS WHIRLPOOL JUST AS THE SKIFF WAS ABOUT TO DETACH FROM ITS PLATING AS YOU KNOW AT THE TURN OF THE TIDE THE WATERS CONFINED BETWEEN THE FAROE AND LOFOTEN ISLANDS
BUT WAS OPPOSED BY SOME PRINCES WHO DREADED ITS INTRODUCTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE DISORDERS AND MADNESS IT BROUGHT WITH IT AS HE APPROACHED HIS NATIVE CITY THEBES PENTHEUS THE KING
THEY WERE SHOUTING THE MAELSTROM COULD A MORE FRIGHTENING NAME HAVE RUNG IN OUR EARS UNDER MORE FRIGHTENING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE WE LYING IN THE DANGEROUS WATERWAYS OFF THE NORWEGIAN COAST
RIGHT AWAY THE CANADIAN REPLIED FIRST NED LAND CLOSED AND BOLTED THE OPENING CUT INTO THE NAUTILUS'S SHEET IRON USING THE MONKEY WRENCH HE HAD WITH HIM
THE MEN ASTONISHED PULLED AT THEIR OARS AND SPREAD MORE SAIL TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS BY THE AID OF BOTH BUT ALL IN VAIN IVY TWINED ROUND THE OARS AND HINDERED THEIR MOTION AND CLUNG TO THE SAILS WITH HEAVY CLUSTERS OF BERRIES
RUSH OUT WITH IRRESISTIBLE VIOLENCE THEY FORM A VORTEX FROM WHICH NO SHIP HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE MONSTROUS WAVES RACE TOGETHER FROM EVERY POINT OF THE HORIZON
SHADOWS GATHERED AND GLOOM OVERRAN THE SEA UNTIL THE MOON CAME UP I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM I COULDN'T SLEEP I WAS ASSAULTED BY NIGHTMARES THAT HORRIBLE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION KEPT REPEATING IN MY MIND'S EYE
NOW EXCUSES HIMSELF AND NOW CONFESSES HIS CRIME AND IMPLORES PARDON THEY PRESS UPON HIM AND WOUND HIM IN VAIN HE CRIES TO HIS AUNTS TO PROTECT HIM FROM HIS MOTHER AUTONOE SEIZED ONE ARM INO THE OTHER
AND THEY MIGHT GET A LIBERAL RANSOM FOR HIM I OBSERVED HIS DRESS HIS WALK HIS FACE THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THEM WHICH I FELT SURE WAS MORE THAN MORTAL I SAID TO MY MEN WHAT GOD THERE IS CONCEALED IN THAT FORM I KNOW NOT
THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE KING PENTHEUS BEHOLDING HIM WITH WRATHFUL COUNTENANCE SAID FELLOW YOU SHALL SPEEDILY BE PUT TO DEATH THAT YOUR FATE MAY BE A WARNING TO OTHERS BUT THOUGH I GRUDGE THE DELAY OF YOUR PUNISHMENT SPEAK
I CLIMBED THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY AND GOING ALONG THE UPPER GANGWAY I ARRIVED AT THE SKIFF I WENT THROUGH THE OPENING THAT HAD ALREADY GIVEN ACCESS TO MY TWO COMPANIONS LET'S GO LET'S GO I EXCLAIMED
I WENT OUT ON THE PLATFORM WHERE I COULD BARELY STAND UPRIGHT AGAINST THE JOLTS OF THE BILLOWS THE SKIES WERE THREATENING BUT LAND LAY INSIDE THOSE DENSE MISTS AND WE HAD TO ESCAPE NOT A SINGLE DAY OR EVEN A SINGLE HOUR COULD WE AFFORD TO LOSE
HEAVING A SIGH SHE SAID I HOPE IT WILL TURN OUT SO BUT I CAN'T HELP BEING AFRAID PEOPLE ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY PRETEND TO BE IF HE IS INDEED JOVE MAKE HIM GIVE SOME PROOF OF IT
I'M WITH YOU WHAT'S MORE THE CANADIAN ADDED IF THEY CATCH ME I'LL DEFEND MYSELF I'LL FIGHT TO THE DEATH THEN WE'LL DIE TOGETHER NED MY FRIEND MY MIND WAS MADE UP THE CANADIAN LEFT ME
WHEN THEY SO TREACHEROUSLY ATTEMPTED TO MAKE PRIZE OF HIM AS ARIADNE SAT LAMENTING HER FATE BACCHUS FOUND HER CONSOLED HER AND MADE HER HIS WIFE AS A MARRIAGE PRESENT HE GAVE HER A GOLDEN CROWN ENRICHED WITH GEMS
IT TOOK ME FIVE MINUTES TO REACH THE DOOR AT THE FAR END WHICH LED INTO THE LIBRARY
BUT WHILE THEY WERE GETTING READY THE INSTRUMENTS OF EXECUTION THE PRISON DOORS CAME OPEN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND THE CHAINS FELL FROM HIS LIMBS AND WHEN THEY LOOKED FOR HIM HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND PENTHEUS WOULD TAKE NO WARNING
HE HADN'T FINISHED SPEAKING WHEN A CRACKING SOUND OCCURRED THE NUTS GAVE WAY AND RIPPED OUT OF ITS SOCKET THE SKIFF WAS HURLED LIKE A STONE FROM A SLING INTO THE MIDST OF THE VORTEX
FINALLY SCHOOLS OF PORPOISE THAT HELD CONTESTS OF SPEED WITH THE NAUTILUS BUT BY THIS POINT OBSERVING STUDYING AND CLASSIFYING WERE OUT OF THE QUESTION BY EVENING WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED LEAGUES UP THE ATLANTIC
COME TO THE SKIFF CONSEIL AND I WILL BE INSIDE WAITING FOR YOU THE CANADIAN LEFT WITHOUT GIVING ME TIME TO ANSWER HIM I WANTED TO VERIFY THE NAUTILUS'S HEADING I MADE MY WAY TO THE LOUNGE
AND WAS LEFT THERE ASLEEP WHILE THE UNGRATEFUL THESEUS PURSUED HIS WAY HOME WITHOUT HER ARIADNE ON WAKING AND FINDING HERSELF DESERTED ABANDONED HERSELF TO GRIEF BUT VENUS TOOK PITY ON HER AND CONSOLED HER WITH THE PROMISE
WHAT WAS HE DOING JUST THEN I LISTENED AT THE DOOR TO HIS STATEROOM I HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS CAPTAIN NEMO WAS INSIDE HE HADN'T GONE TO BED
I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE DREADING YET DESIRING AN ENCOUNTER WITH CAPTAIN NEMO WANTING YET NOT WANTING TO SEE HIM WHAT WOULD I SAY TO HIM HOW COULD I HIDE THE INVOLUNTARY HORROR HE INSPIRED IN ME NO
ASK HIM TO COME ARRAYED IN ALL HIS SPLENDORS SUCH AS HE WEARS IN HEAVEN THAT WILL PUT THE MATTER BEYOND A DOUBT SEMELE WAS PERSUADED TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT
THE BUSINESS OF CORRUPTION WHEN IT IS TO EMBRACE SO CONSIDERABLE A NUMBER OF MEN REQUIRES TIME AS WELL AS MEANS NOR WOULD IT BE FOUND EASY SUDDENLY TO EMBARK THEM DISPERSED AS THEY WOULD BE OVER THIRTEEN STATES
BUT WITH THE PROSPECT BEFORE HIM OF APPROACHING AN INEVITABLE ANNIHILATION HIS AVARICE WOULD BE LIKELY TO GET THE VICTORY OVER HIS CAUTION HIS VANITY OR HIS AMBITION AN AMBITIOUS MAN TOO
AND SIGHING FOR A PLACE WHICH THEY WERE DESTINED NEVER MORE TO POSSESS A THIRD ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE
WHAT IS TO BE DONE BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN RESPECT TO THE LATTER THE APPOINTMENT OF AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON AS VICE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OBJECTED TO AS SUPERFLUOUS IF NOT MISCHIEVOUS
THE TENDENCY OF THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO ABSORB EVERY OTHER HAS BEEN FULLY DISPLAYED AND ILLUSTRATED BY EXAMPLES IN SOME PRECEDING NUMBERS IN GOVERNMENTS PURELY REPUBLICAN THIS TENDENCY IS ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE
OF MEN WHO POSSESS THEIR CONFIDENCE MORE THAN THEY DESERVE IT AND OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO POSSESS RATHER THAN TO DESERVE IT WHEN OCCASIONS PRESENT THEMSELVES IN WHICH THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THEIR INCLINATIONS
EITHER IN THE COMMUNITY OR IN THE LEGISLATURE AS ITS BEST RECOMMENDATION BUT SUCH MEN ENTERTAIN VERY CRUDE NOTIONS AS WELL OF THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH GOVERNMENT WAS INSTITUTED AS OF THE TRUE MEANS BY WHICH THE PUBLIC HAPPINESS MAY BE PROMOTED
IT IS LIMITED TO EXECUTIVE DETAILS AND FALLS PECULIARLY WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT THE ACTUAL CONDUCT OF FOREIGN NEGOTIATIONS THE PREPARATORY PLANS OF FINANCE
WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SEATED ON THE SUMMIT OF HIS COUNTRY'S HONORS WHEN HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TIME AT WHICH HE MUST DESCEND FROM THE EXALTED EMINENCE FOR EVER AND REFLECTED THAT NO EXERTION OF MERIT ON HIS PART COULD SAVE HIM FROM THE UNWELCOME REVERSE
THE DURATION IN OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE FROM THE NEW YORK PACKET
THIS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT WILL AT ONCE SUGGEST TO US THE INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF THE EXECUTIVE MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE AND THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION TO REVERSE AND UNDO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY A PREDECESSOR
THE OTHER CONSIDERATION IS THAT AS THE VICE PRESIDENT MAY OCCASIONALLY BECOME A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE PRESIDENT IN THE SUPREME EXECUTIVE MAGISTRACY ALL THE REASONS WHICH RECOMMEND THE MODE OF ELECTION PRESCRIBED FOR THE ONE
THIS OFTEN APPLIES TO THEIR VERY ERRORS BUT THEIR GOOD SENSE WOULD DESPISE THE ADULATOR WHO SHOULD PRETEND THAT THEY ALWAYS REASON RIGHT ABOUT THE MEANS OF PROMOTING IT THEY KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THEY SOMETIMES ERR AND THE WONDER IS
THE SAME RULE WHICH TEACHES THE PROPRIETY OF A PARTITION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF POWER TEACHES US LIKEWISE THAT THIS PARTITION OUGHT TO BE SO CONTRIVED AS TO RENDER THE ONE INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER
THE LAST IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE REASON TO APPROVE OF HIS CONDUCT TO CONTINUE HIM IN HIS STATION IN ORDER TO PROLONG THE UTILITY OF HIS TALENTS AND VIRTUES AND TO SECURE TO THE GOVERNMENT THE ADVANTAGE OF PERMANENCY
OR TO EVERY TRANSIENT IMPULSE WHICH THE PEOPLE MAY RECEIVE FROM THE ARTS OF MEN WHO FLATTER THEIR PREJUDICES TO BETRAY THEIR INTERESTS IT IS A JUST OBSERVATION THAT THE PEOPLE COMMONLY INTEND THE PUBLIC GOOD
THE FIRST IS NECESSARY TO GIVE TO THE OFFICER HIMSELF THE INCLINATION AND THE RESOLUTION TO ACT HIS PART WELL AND TO THE COMMUNITY TIME AND LEISURE TO OBSERVE THE TENDENCY OF HIS MEASURES AND THENCE TO FORM AN EXPERIMENTAL ESTIMATE OF THEIR MERITS
IN ANY COMBINATIONS FOUNDED UPON MOTIVES WHICH THOUGH THEY COULD NOT PROPERLY BE DENOMINATED CORRUPT MIGHT YET BE OF A NATURE TO MISLEAD THEM FROM THEIR DUTY
BY THE VOLUNTARY SUFFRAGES OF THE COMMUNITY EXERCISING A CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE THERE IS AN EXCESS OF REFINEMENT IN THE IDEA OF DISABLING THE PEOPLE TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE MEN WHO HAD ENTITLED THEMSELVES IN THEIR OPINION
TO WHAT PURPOSE SEPARATE THE EXECUTIVE OR THE JUDICIARY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE IF BOTH THE EXECUTIVE AND THE JUDICIARY ARE SO CONSTITUTED AS TO BE AT THE ABSOLUTE DEVOTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE SUCH A SEPARATION MUST BE MERELY NOMINAL
THESE AND OTHER MATTERS OF A LIKE NATURE CONSTITUTE WHAT SEEMS TO BE MOST PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT THE PERSONS THEREFORE TO WHOSE IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT THESE DIFFERENT MATTERS ARE COMMITTED
THEY HAVE NOT MADE THE APPOINTMENT OF THE PRESIDENT TO DEPEND ON ANY PREEXISTING BODIES OF MEN WHO MIGHT BE TAMPERED WITH BEFOREHAND TO PROSTITUTE THEIR VOTES BUT THEY HAVE REFERRED IT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO AN IMMEDIATE ACT OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA
WHAT BUT THAT HE MIGHT BE UNEQUAL TO THE TASK WHICH THE CONSTITUTION ASSIGNS HIM I SHALL ONLY ADD THAT IF HIS DURATION BE SUCH AS TO LEAVE A DOUBT OF HIS FIRMNESS THAT DOUBT IS INCONSISTENT WITH A JEALOUSY OF HIS ENCROACHMENTS
IN WHICH A CONDUCT OF THIS KIND HAS SAVED THE PEOPLE FROM VERY FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR OWN MISTAKES AND HAS PROCURED LASTING MONUMENTS OF THEIR GRATITUDE TO THE MEN WHO HAD COURAGE AND MAGNANIMITY ENOUGH TO SERVE THEM AT THE PERIL OF THEIR DISPLEASURE
THE PERSON SUBSTITUTED IS WARRANTED IN SUPPOSING THAT THE DISMISSION OF HIS PREDECESSOR HAS PROCEEDED FROM A DISLIKE TO HIS MEASURES AND THAT THE LESS HE RESEMBLES HIM THE MORE HE WILL RECOMMEND HIMSELF TO THE FAVOR OF HIS CONSTITUENTS
PRE EMINENT FOR ABILITY AND VIRTUE AND THIS WILL BE THOUGHT NO INCONSIDERABLE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CONSTITUTION BY THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE SHARE WHICH THE EXECUTIVE IN EVERY GOVERNMENT MUST NECESSARILY HAVE IN ITS GOOD OR ILL ADMINISTRATION
WILL AT LEAST ENTER UPON THE TASK FREE FROM ANY SINISTER BIAS THEIR TRANSIENT EXISTENCE AND THEIR DETACHED SITUATION ALREADY TAKEN NOTICE OF AFFORD A SATISFACTORY PROSPECT OF THEIR CONTINUING SO TO THE CONCLUSION OF IT
OBNOXIOUS TO ITS RESENTMENT IT MAY BE ASKED ALSO WHETHER A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS WOULD ANSWER THE END PROPOSED AND IF IT WOULD NOT WHETHER A LESS PERIOD WHICH WOULD AT LEAST BE RECOMMENDED BY GREATER SECURITY AGAINST AMBITIOUS DESIGNS
AS ON THE ONE HAND A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIRMNESS OF THE EXECUTIVE IN A SUFFICIENT DEGREE TO RENDER IT A VERY VALUABLE INGREDIENT IN THE COMPOSITION SO ON THE OTHER IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ANY ALARM FOR THE PUBLIC LIBERTY
WOULD WITH INFINITE RELUCTANCE YIELD TO THE NECESSITY OF TAKING HIS LEAVE FOREVER OF A POST IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR POWER AND PRE EMINENCE HAD ACQUIRED THE FORCE OF HABIT AND IF HE HAD BEEN FORTUNATE OR ADROIT ENOUGH TO CONCILIATE THE GOOD WILL OF THE PEOPLE
TO BE EXERTED IN THE CHOICE OF PERSONS FOR THE TEMPORARY AND SOLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE APPOINTMENT AND THEY HAVE EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY TO THIS TRUST ALL THOSE WHO FROM SITUATION MIGHT BE SUSPECTED OF TOO GREAT DEVOTION TO THE PRESIDENT IN OFFICE
IF THE CASE SHOULD ONLY BE THAT HE MIGHT LAY IT DOWN UNLESS CONTINUED BY A NEW CHOICE AND IF HE SHOULD BE DESIROUS OF BEING CONTINUED HIS WISHES CONSPIRING WITH HIS FEARS WOULD TEND STILL MORE POWERFULLY TO CORRUPT HIS INTEGRITY
THE REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLE DEMANDS THAT THE DELIBERATE SENSE OF THE COMMUNITY SHOULD GOVERN THE CONDUCT OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY INTRUST THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR AFFAIRS BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN UNQUALIFIED COMPLAISANCE TO EVERY SUDDEN BREEZE OF PASSION
AT ONE TIME IN ONE PLACE NOTHING WAS MORE TO BE DESIRED THAN THAT EVERY PRACTICABLE OBSTACLE SHOULD BE OPPOSED TO CABAL INTRIGUE AND CORRUPTION
THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT IN ITS LARGEST SENSE COMPREHENDS ALL THE OPERATIONS OF THE BODY POLITIC WHETHER LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE OR JUDICIARY BUT IN ITS MOST USUAL AND PERHAPS ITS MOST PRECISE SIGNIFICATION
THIS ADVANTAGE WILL ALSO BE SECURED BY MAKING HIS RE ELECTION TO DEPEND ON A SPECIAL BODY OF REPRESENTATIVES DEPUTED BY THE SOCIETY FOR THE SINGLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE IMPORTANT CHOICE ALL THESE ADVANTAGES WILL HAPPILY COMBINE IN THE PLAN DEVISED BY THE CONVENTION
IT WOULD NECESSITATE A MUTABILITY OF MEASURES IT IS NOT GENERALLY TO BE EXPECTED THAT MEN WILL VARY AND MEASURES REMAIN UNIFORM THE CONTRARY IS THE USUAL COURSE OF THINGS
THE LATTER MAY SOMETIMES STAND IN OPPOSITION TO THE FORMER AND AT OTHER TIMES THE PEOPLE MAY BE ENTIRELY NEUTRAL IN EITHER SUPPOSITION IT IS CERTAINLY DESIRABLE THAT THE EXECUTIVE SHOULD BE IN A SITUATION TO DARE TO ACT HIS OWN OPINION WITH VIGOR AND DECISION
THOUGH NOT MORE CONCLUSIVE WILL RESULT FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OVER THE PEOPLE WHICH MIGHT BE EMPLOYED TO PREVENT THE RE ELECTION OF A MAN WHO BY AN UPRIGHT RESISTANCE TO ANY SINISTER PROJECT OF THAT BODY SHOULD HAVE MADE HIMSELF
ON ALL BUT THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES
AND OF COURSE WILL BE WILLING TO RISK MORE FOR THE SAKE OF THE ONE THAN FOR THE SAKE OF THE OTHER THIS REMARK IS NOT LESS APPLICABLE TO A POLITICAL PRIVILEGE OR HONOR OR TRUST THAN TO ANY ARTICLE OF ORDINARY PROPERTY
BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT EVEN A PARTIAL EXCLUSION WOULD ALWAYS RENDER THE READMISSION OF THE PERSON A REMOTE AND PRECARIOUS OBJECT THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE WILL APPLY NEARLY AS FULLY TO ONE CASE AS TO THE OTHER
IN THE MANNER BEST SUITED TO ITS EXIGENCIES AND CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT SUPPOSING THE PERSONAL ESSENTIALITY OF THE MAN IT IS EVIDENT THAT A CHANGE OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF A WAR OR AT ANY SIMILAR CRISIS FOR ANOTHER
OF ESTABLISHING HIMSELF IN THE ESTEEM AND GOOD WILL OF HIS CONSTITUENTS HE MIGHT THEN HAZARD WITH SAFETY IN PROPORTION TO THE PROOFS HE HAD GIVEN OF HIS WISDOM AND INTEGRITY AND TO THE TITLE HE HAD ACQUIRED TO THE RESPECT AND ATTACHMENT OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS
AND ANOTHER TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE LEGISLATIVE BODY THE FIRST COMPORTS WITH THE LAST VIOLATES THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND WHATEVER MAY BE THE FORMS OF THE CONSTITUTION UNITES ALL POWER IN THE SAME HANDS
NO SENATOR REPRESENTATIVE OR OTHER PERSON HOLDING A PLACE OF TRUST OR PROFIT UNDER THE UNITED STATES CAN BE OF THE NUMBERS OF THE ELECTORS THUS WITHOUT CORRUPTING THE BODY OF THE PEOPLE THE IMMEDIATE AGENTS IN THE ELECTION
ALL THE ANCIENT ESTABLISHMENTS AS WELL IN THE CHURCH AS STATE IF THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE ON A RECENT OCCASION TO MAKE THE MONARCH TREMBLE AT THE PROSPECT
AND THE LITTLE ARTS OF POPULARITY MAY ALONE SUFFICE TO ELEVATE A MAN TO THE FIRST HONORS IN A SINGLE STATE BUT IT WILL REQUIRE OTHER TALENTS AND A DIFFERENT KIND OF MERIT TO ESTABLISH HIM IN THE ESTEEM AND CONFIDENCE OF THE WHOLE UNION
BUT THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO HAPPILY CONCERTED IN THE SYSTEM UNDER CONSIDERATION PROMISE AN EFFECTUAL SECURITY AGAINST THIS MISCHIEF THE CHOICE OF SEVERAL TO FORM AN INTERMEDIATE BODY OF ELECTORS
IN A WISE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION NOTHING APPEARS MORE PLAUSIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT NOR MORE ILL FOUNDED UPON CLOSE INSPECTION THAN A SCHEME WHICH IN RELATION TO THE PRESENT POINT HAS HAD SOME RESPECTABLE ADVOCATES I MEAN
WILL BE MUCH LESS APT TO CONVULSE THE COMMUNITY WITH ANY EXTRAORDINARY OR VIOLENT MOVEMENTS THAN THE CHOICE OF ONE WHO WAS HIMSELF TO BE THE FINAL OBJECT OF THE PUBLIC WISHES AND AS THE ELECTORS CHOSEN IN EACH STATE
THEY OFTEN APPEAR DISPOSED TO EXERT AN IMPERIOUS CONTROL OVER THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND AS THEY COMMONLY HAVE THE PEOPLE ON THEIR SIDE
AND IN WHICH HE MIGHT REASONABLY PROMISE HIMSELF THAT THERE WOULD BE TIME ENOUGH BEFORE IT ARRIVED TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY SENSIBLE OF THE PROPRIETY OF THE MEASURES HE MIGHT INCLINE TO PURSUE THOUGH IT BE PROBABLE THAT AS HE APPROACHED THE MOMENT
THE APPLICATION AND DISBURSEMENT OF THE PUBLIC MONEYS IN CONFORMITY TO THE GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ARMY AND NAVY THE DIRECTIONS OF THE OPERATIONS OF WAR
THAT OF CONTINUING THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE FOR A CERTAIN TIME AND THEN EXCLUDING HIM FROM IT EITHER FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OR FOREVER AFTER THIS EXCLUSION WHETHER TEMPORARY OR PERPETUAL WOULD HAVE NEARLY THE SAME EFFECTS
EVEN OF EQUAL MERIT WOULD AT ALL TIMES BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE COMMUNITY INASMUCH AS IT WOULD SUBSTITUTE INEXPERIENCE TO EXPERIENCE AND WOULD TEND TO UNHINGE AND SET AFLOAT THE ALREADY SETTLED TRAIN OF THE ADMINISTRATION
IN CERTAIN EMERGENCIES OF THE STATE THEIR PRESENCE MIGHT BE OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST OR SAFETY THERE IS NO NATION WHICH HAS NOT AT ONE PERIOD OR ANOTHER EXPERIENCED AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF THE SERVICES OF PARTICULAR MEN
TO ABANDON THE STATION IN WHICH IT WAS ACQUIRED AND TO WHICH IT IS ADAPTED THIS NEVERTHELESS IS THE PRECISE IMPORT OF ALL THOSE REGULATIONS WHICH EXCLUDE MEN FROM SERVING THEIR COUNTRY
WHEN THEY WERE CONSCIOUS THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF THE STATION WITH WHICH IT WAS CONNECTED MUST BE RELINQUISHED AT A DETERMINATE PERIOD THAN WHEN THEY WERE PERMITTED TO ENTERTAIN A HOPE OF OBTAINING
AND TO THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED UNDER HIS AUSPICES WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST IT MUST BE EVIDENT THAT THE LONGER THE DURATION IN OFFICE THE GREATER WILL BE THE PROBABILITY OF OBTAINING SO IMPORTANT AN ADVANTAGE
UNLESS THE EXCLUSION BE PERPETUAL THERE WILL BE NO PRETENSE TO INFER THE FIRST ADVANTAGE BUT EVEN IN THAT CASE MAY HE HAVE NO OBJECT BEYOND HIS PRESENT STATION TO WHICH HE MAY SACRIFICE HIS INDEPENDENCE
THAT THE TRUE TEST OF A GOOD GOVERNMENT IS ITS APTITUDE AND TENDENCY TO PRODUCE A GOOD ADMINISTRATION THE VICE PRESIDENT IS TO BE CHOSEN IN THE SAME MANNER WITH THE PRESIDENT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT THE SENATE IS TO DO IN RESPECT TO THE FORMER
THERE MAY BE CONCEIVED CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THIS DISGUST OF THE PEOPLE SECONDING THE THWARTED AMBITION OF SUCH A FAVORITE MIGHT OCCASION GREATER DANGER TO LIBERTY THAN COULD EVER REASONABLY BE DREADED FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF A PERPETUATION IN OFFICE
CAN AFFECT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE ON THE LEGISLATURE UNLESS THE ONE WERE POSSESSED OF THE POWER OF APPOINTING OR DISPLACING THE OTHER ONE ANSWER TO THIS INQUIRY MAY BE DRAWN FROM THE PRINCIPLE ALREADY REMARKED
MIGHT CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE REGULAR PERQUISITES OF HIS SITUATION AND MIGHT EVEN BE UNWILLING TO RISK THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ABUSE OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES HIS AVARICE MIGHT BE A GUARD UPON HIS AVARICE
AN AVARICIOUS MAN WHO MIGHT HAPPEN TO FILL THE OFFICE LOOKING FORWARD TO A TIME WHEN HE MUST AT ALL EVENTS YIELD UP THE EMOLUMENTS HE ENJOYED WOULD FEEL A PROPENSITY NOT EASY TO BE RESISTED BY SUCH A MAN
THE MODE OF APPOINTMENT OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE OF THE UNITED STATES IS ALMOST THE ONLY PART OF THE SYSTEM OF ANY CONSEQUENCE WHICH HAS ESCAPED WITHOUT SEVERE CENSURE OR WHICH HAS RECEIVED THE SLIGHTEST MARK OF APPROBATION FROM ITS OPPONENTS
AS TO THE SECOND SUPPOSED ADVANTAGE THERE IS STILL GREATER REASON TO ENTERTAIN DOUBTS CONCERNING IT IF THE EXCLUSION WERE TO BE PERPETUAL A MAN OF IRREGULAR AMBITION OF WHOM ALONE THERE COULD BE REASON IN ANY CASE TO ENTERTAIN APPREHENSION
THE PROCESS OF ELECTION AFFORDS A MORAL CERTAINTY THAT THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT WILL NEVER FALL TO THE LOT OF ANY MAN WHO IS NOT IN AN EMINENT DEGREE ENDOWED WITH THE REQUISITE QUALIFICATIONS TALENTS FOR LOW INTRIGUE
THEY ALWAYS ACT WITH SUCH MOMENTUM AS TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION IT MAY PERHAPS BE ASKED HOW THE SHORTNESS OF THE DURATION IN OFFICE
AND ACTING UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES FAVORABLE TO DELIBERATION AND TO A JUDICIOUS COMBINATION OF ALL THE REASONS AND INDUCEMENTS WHICH WERE PROPER TO GOVERN THEIR CHOICE A SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS
IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS OFFICE THAT EXPERIENCE IS THE PARENT OF WISDOM IS AN ADAGE THE TRUTH OF WHICH IS RECOGNIZED BY THE WISEST AS WELL AS THE SIMPLEST OF MANKIND WHAT MORE DESIRABLE OR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN THIS QUALITY IN THE GOVERNORS OF NATIONS
THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONAL CONFIDENCES AND ATTACHMENTS WOULD BE LIKELY TO INDUCE EVERY NEW PRESIDENT TO PROMOTE A CHANGE OF MEN TO FILL THE SUBORDINATE STATIONS
WHERE MORE DESIRABLE OR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN IN THE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF A NATION CAN IT BE WISE TO PUT THIS DESIRABLE AND ESSENTIAL QUALITY UNDER THE BAN OF THE CONSTITUTION AND TO DECLARE THAT THE MOMENT IT IS ACQUIRED ITS POSSESSOR SHALL BE COMPELLED
OR OF SO CONSIDERABLE A PORTION OF IT AS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAKE HIM A SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE FOR THE DISTINGUISHED OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IT WILL NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY THAT THERE WILL BE A CONSTANT PROBABILITY OF SEEING THE STATION FILLED BY CHARACTERS
THEY MAY OBVIATE THE FATAL INCONVENIENCES OF FLUCTUATING COUNCILS AND A VARIABLE POLICY THESE ARE SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH WOULD FLOW FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EXCLUSION THEY APPLY MOST FORCIBLY TO THE SCHEME OF A PERPETUAL EXCLUSION
THE MOST PLAUSIBLE OF THESE WHO HAS APPEARED IN PRINT
ARE TO ASSEMBLE AND VOTE IN THE STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE CHOSEN THIS DETACHED AND DIVIDED SITUATION WILL EXPOSE THEM MUCH LESS TO HEATS AND FERMENTS WHICH MIGHT BE COMMUNICATED FROM THEM TO THE PEOPLE THAN IF THEY WERE ALL TO BE CONVENED
THOUGH WE CANNOT ACQUIESCE IN THE POLITICAL HERESY OF THE POET WHO SAYS FOR FORMS OF GOVERNMENT LET FOOLS CONTEST THAT WHICH IS BEST ADMINISTERED IS BEST YET WE MAY SAFELY PRONOUNCE
ON THE ARRIVAL OF WHICH HE NOT ONLY MAY BUT MUST BE EXPOSED TO THEIR RESENTMENTS UPON AN EQUAL PERHAPS UPON AN INFERIOR FOOTING IT IS NOT AN EASY POINT TO DETERMINE WHETHER HIS INDEPENDENCE WOULD BE MOST PROMOTED OR IMPAIRED BY SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT
HAVE BY RAPID STRIDES REDUCED THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN AND THE PRIVILEGES OF THE NOBILITY WITHIN THE LIMITS THEY CONCEIVED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF A FREE GOVERNMENT WHILE THEY RAISED THEMSELVES TO THE RANK AND CONSEQUENCE OF A COEQUAL BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE
AND THE PERSON WHO MAY HAPPEN TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE WHOLE NUMBER OF VOTES WILL BE THE PRESIDENT BUT AS A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES MIGHT NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN TO CENTRE IN ONE MAN AND AS IT MIGHT BE UNSAFE TO PERMIT LESS THAN A MAJORITY TO BE CONCLUSIVE
BUT HOWEVER INCLINED WE MIGHT BE TO INSIST UPON AN UNBOUNDED COMPLAISANCE IN THE EXECUTIVE TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THE PEOPLE WE CAN WITH NO PROPRIETY CONTEND FOR A LIKE COMPLAISANCE TO THE HUMORS OF THE LEGISLATURE
IT IS PROVIDED THAT IN SUCH A CONTINGENCY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SHALL SELECT OUT OF THE CANDIDATES WHO SHALL HAVE THE FIVE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES THE MAN WHO IN THEIR OPINION MAY BE BEST QUALIFIED FOR THE OFFICE
IN PARTICULAR SITUATIONS PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY TO THE PRESERVATION OF ITS POLITICAL EXISTENCE HOW UNWISE THEREFORE MUST BE EVERY SUCH SELF DENYING ORDINANCE AS SERVES TO PROHIBIT A NATION FROM MAKING USE OF ITS OWN CITIZENS
A FIFTH ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD OPERATE AS A CONSTITUTIONAL INTERDICTION OF STABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION BY NECESSITATING A CHANGE OF MEN IN THE FIRST OFFICE OF THE NATION
WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES PROMISED TO COUNTERBALANCE THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY ARE REPRESENTED TO BE FIRST GREATER INDEPENDENCE IN THE MAGISTRATE
FROM THE INDEPENDENT EXERTION OF HIS POWERS OR FROM ENCOUNTERING THE ILL HUMORS HOWEVER TRANSIENT WHICH MAY HAPPEN TO PREVAIL EITHER IN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE SOCIETY ITSELF OR EVEN IN A PREDOMINANT FACTION IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY
HOW COULD THEY BETTER GRATIFY THIS THAN BY RAISING A CREATURE OF THEIR OWN TO THE CHIEF MAGISTRACY OF THE UNION BUT THE CONVENTION HAVE GUARDED AGAINST ALL DANGER OF THIS SORT WITH THE MOST PROVIDENT AND JUDICIOUS ATTENTION
THE INFERENCE FROM IT IS THAT A MAN ACTING IN THE CAPACITY OF CHIEF MAGISTRATE UNDER A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME HE MUST LAY DOWN HIS OFFICE WILL BE APT TO FEEL HIMSELF TOO LITTLE INTERESTED IN IT TO HAZARD ANY MATERIAL CENSURE OR PERPLEXITY
TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE OPPORTUNITY HE ENJOYED WHILE IT LASTED AND MIGHT NOT SCRUPLE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE MOST CORRUPT EXPEDIENTS TO MAKE THE HARVEST AS ABUNDANT AS IT WAS TRANSITORY THOUGH THE SAME MAN PROBABLY WITH A DIFFERENT PROSPECT BEFORE HIM
ADD TO THIS THAT THE SAME MAN MIGHT BE VAIN OR AMBITIOUS AS WELL AS AVARICIOUS AND IF HE COULD EXPECT TO PROLONG HIS HONORS BY HIS GOOD CONDUCT HE MIGHT HESITATE TO SACRIFICE HIS APPETITE FOR THEM TO HIS APPETITE FOR GAIN
WHICH IS THAT THE PEOPLE OF EACH STATE SHALL CHOOSE A NUMBER OF PERSONS AS ELECTORS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF SUCH STATE IN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WHO SHALL ASSEMBLE WITHIN THE STATE AND VOTE FOR SOME FIT PERSON AS PRESIDENT
THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL IN WHICH THE PROSPECT OF ANNIHILATION WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY REMOTE NOT TO HAVE AN IMPROPER EFFECT UPON THE CONDUCT OF A MAN INDUED WITH A TOLERABLE PORTION OF FORTITUDE
THESE MOST DEADLY ADVERSARIES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT NATURALLY HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MAKE THEIR APPROACHES FROM MORE THAN ONE QUARTER BUT CHIEFLY FROM THE DESIRE IN FOREIGN POWERS TO GAIN AN IMPROPER ASCENDANT IN OUR COUNCILS
WOULD NOT FOR THAT REASON BE PREFERABLE TO A LONGER PERIOD WHICH WAS AT THE SAME TIME TOO SHORT FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPIRING THE DESIRED FIRMNESS AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE MAGISTRATE IT CANNOT BE AFFIRMED THAT A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS OR ANY OTHER LIMITED DURATION
IS TO MAKE THEIR INTERESTS COINCIDE WITH THEIR DUTY EVEN THE LOVE OF FAME THE RULING PASSION OF THE NOBLEST MINDS WHICH WOULD PROMPT A MAN TO PLAN AND UNDERTAKE EXTENSIVE AND ARDUOUS ENTERPRISES FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT
THAT THEY SO SELDOM ERR AS THEY DO BESET AS THEY CONTINUALLY ARE BY THE WILES OF PARASITES AND SYCOPHANTS BY THE SNARES OF THE AMBITIOUS THE AVARICIOUS THE DESPERATE BY THE ARTIFICES
AND WE NEED NOT BE APPREHENSIVE THAT THERE WILL BE TOO MUCH STABILITY WHILE THERE IS EVEN THE OPTION OF CHANGING NOR NEED WE DESIRE TO PROHIBIT THE PEOPLE FROM CONTINUING THEIR CONFIDENCE WHERE THEY THINK IT MAY BE SAFELY PLACED AND WHERE BY CONSTANCY ON THEIR PART
OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE ASSISTANTS OR DEPUTIES OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND ON THIS ACCOUNT THEY OUGHT TO DERIVE THEIR OFFICES FROM HIS APPOINTMENT AT LEAST FROM HIS NOMINATION AND OUGHT TO BE SUBJECT TO HIS SUPERINTENDENCE
SELECTED BY THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS FROM THE GENERAL MASS WILL BE MOST LIKELY TO POSSESS THE INFORMATION AND DISCERNMENT REQUISITE TO SUCH COMPLICATED INVESTIGATIONS
AND MUST COMMIT THAT TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN REPUTATION TO HANDS WHICH MIGHT BE UNEQUAL OR UNFRIENDLY TO THE TASK THE MOST TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE GENERALITY OF MEN IN SUCH A SITUATION IS THE NEGATIVE MERIT OF NOT DOING HARM
BY THE CHOICE OF THEIR FELLOWCITIZENS AFTER THEY HAVE BY A COURSE OF SERVICE FITTED THEMSELVES FOR DOING IT WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF UTILITY A FOURTH ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE BANISHING MEN FROM STATIONS IN WHICH
INSTEAD OF THE POSITIVE MERIT OF DOING GOOD ANOTHER ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE TEMPTATION TO SORDID VIEWS TO PECULATION AND IN SOME INSTANCES TO USURPATION
AND THESE CAUSES TOGETHER COULD NOT FAIL TO OCCASION A DISGRACEFUL AND RUINOUS MUTABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH A POSITIVE DURATION OF CONSIDERABLE EXTENT I CONNECT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF RE ELIGIBILITY
IT IS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN NATURE THAT A MAN WILL BE INTERESTED IN WHATEVER HE POSSESSES IN PROPORTION TO THE FIRMNESS OR PRECARIOUSNESS OF THE TENURE BY WHICH HE HOLDS IT
IF A BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS FROM THE MOST FEEBLE BEGINNINGS FROM THE MERE POWER OF ASSENTING OR DISAGREEING TO THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW TAX
BUT TO MEN CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE SPECIAL PURPOSE AND AT THE PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE IT WAS EQUALLY DESIRABLE THAT THE IMMEDIATE ELECTION SHOULD BE MADE BY MEN MOST CAPABLE OF ANALYZING THE QUALITIES ADAPTED TO THE STATION
AND HESITATE NOT TO AFFIRM THAT IF THE MANNER OF IT BE NOT PERFECT IT IS AT LEAST EXCELLENT
APPLY WITH GREAT IF NOT WITH EQUAL FORCE TO THE MANNER OF APPOINTING THE OTHER IT IS REMARKABLE THAT IN THIS AS IN MOST OTHER INSTANCES THE OBJECTION WHICH IS MADE WOULD LIE AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION OF THIS STATE WE HAVE A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
IT'S UP TO YOU DAN SHE TOLD HIM AND THERE WAS ALL THE SINCERITY IN THE WORLD IN HER BLUE EYES I'M ON YOUR SIDE NOW HE BEGAN COUNTING ON HIS FINGERS LET'S SEE THE SPARE BATTERY
HE WAS GAINING SOME PROFICIENCY HOWEVER HE FELT BUT NOW HE HAD TO WASTE FUEL AND RUIN HIS ORBIT AGAIN THERE WAS NO WAY TO PRACTICE MANEUVERING WITHOUT ACTUALLY DOING SO IN THE END HE COMPROMISED
THEY WANTED AN EQUALITY WITH THE GREATEST MEN WITHOUT GIVING UP THEIR DRIVE TOWARD MEDIOCRITY AND THEY MEANT TO HAVE IT IN A WAY THEY GOT IT THEY GOT THE VOTE EXTENDED TO EVERYONE THE MAN ON SUBSIDY OR PUBLIC DOLE COULD VOTE TO DEMAND MORE
CONSIDERING THE DISTANCE HE WAS GOING BRING ME TWO COMPLETE DINNERS ONE EARTH NORMAL AND ONE MARS NORMAL OKAY FELDMAN
HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT THE INFLATED SUIT HELD ENOUGH OXYGEN FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HIS BODY STRUCK THE EDGE OF THE AIRLOCK AND A HAND JERKED HIM INSIDE THE OUTER SEAL WAS SLAMMED SHUT AND LOCKED AND THERE WAS A HISS OF AIR ENTERING
IT WAS WITHIN FIVE FEET NOW AGAIN HE WAITED UNTIL HE SEEMED TO BE IN POSITION THIS TIME HE THREW THE BOTTLE AWAY FROM IT IT ADDED SPIN TO HIS VERTICAL AXIS BUT THE ROPE CAME INTO VIEW WITHIN ARM'S REACH HE GRASPED IT
HE SQUEEZED SOME OF THE GRAVY AND BITS OF MEAT INTO ONE OF HIS BOTTLES STICKING TO HIS PURPOSE THEN HE FELL TO ON THE REST BUT AFTER A FEW BITES IT WAS QUEERLY UNSATISFACTORY THE SEEMINGLY UNAPPEALING MARS NORMAL RAGOUT SUITED HIS CURRENT TASTES BETTER AFTER ALL
AND IT STILL LACKED FIVE MINUTES OF THE DEADLINE THEY MARCHED HIM DOWN THE HALLWAY TO MEET EVERTS COMING TOWARD THEM THERE WERE STILL THREE MINUTES LEFT WHEN THEY REACHED THE AIRLOCK WITH ITS INNER DOOR ALREADY OPEN THE SPACESUITED MAN CLIMBED INTO IT
AND ONLY ANODYNE TABLETS IN PLACE OF ANESTHESIA HE GOT THE BULLET OUT AND SEWED UP THE WOUND WITH A BIT OF SURGICAL THREAD HE'D BEEN USING TO TIE UP A TORN GOOD LUCK EMBLEM THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND WRITER RECORDED THE WHOLE THING
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT GREW UP SO FAST IT NEVER EVEN KNEW IT WASN'T A REAL PART OF THE GOVERNMENT IT DEVELOPED DURING A PERIOD OF CHAOS WHEN ANOTHER COUNTRY CALLED RUSSIA GOT THE FIRST HUNK OF METAL ABOVE THE ATMOSPHERE
AND THE MEDICAL LOBBY WAS UNTOUCHABLE RYAN MADE A DEAL WITH SPACE LOBBY AND THE TWO EFFECTIVELY RAN THE WORLD NONE OF THE SMALLER LOBBIES COULD BUCK THEM AND NEITHER COULD THE GOVERNMENT THERE WAS STILL A PRESIDENT AND A CONGRESS
SIR FOR A MOMENT AS THE SMELL OF REAL STEAK REACHED HIM DOC REGRETTED THE FACT THAT HIS METABOLISM HAD BEEN SWITCHED THEN HE SHRUGGED A LITTLE WOULDN'T HURT HIM THOUGH THERE WAS NO PROPER NOURISHMENT IN IT
WE WENT THROUGH IT TOGETHER SHORTLY AFTER HAVING OUR METABOLISM SWITCHED DURING THE FOOD SHORTAGE OF EIGHTY EIGHT
CHRIS MADE FURTHER PLANS AND HARNETT GATHERED MATERIAL THERE WAS ALSO A PHOTOGRAPHER AND WRITER BUT THEY HADN'T BEEN INTRODUCED BY NAME FELDMAN REACHED BAXTER FIRST THE MAN WAS MOANING AND SCARED AND HE WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY
WHEN I'M CONVINCED I'M SAFE WITH YOU I MAY TELL YOU ABOUT IT OH HER VOICE WAS LOW THEN SHE SIGHED I SUPPOSE I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HATE ME DAN I DON'T HATE YOU I'M TOO MIXED UP TOMORROW MAYBE BUT NOT NOW
THEY WERE HALFWAY TO THE VILLAGE WHEN A DOZEN TRACTORS CAME RACING UP AND JAKE PILED OUT OF THE LEAD ONE TO DRAG THE TWO IN WITH HIM HEARD ABOUT IT FROM THE BROADCASTS AND FIGURED YOU MIGHT LAND AROUND HERE GOOD TO SEE YOU DOC
HE THREW BACK HIS HELMET JUST AS CHRIS RYAN JERKED HERS OFF HER VOICE SHOOK ALMOST HYSTERICALLY THANK GOD DAN I ALMOST GAVE UP I LIKED THE AIR OUT THERE BETTER HE TOLD HER BITTERLY IF YOU'LL OPEN THE LOCK AGAIN I'LL LEAVE
AN OBSCURE SCIENTIST IN ONE OF THE LABORATORIES RUN BY THE MEDICAL LOBBY FOUND A CURE BEFORE THE FIRST WAVES OF THE EPIDEMIC HIT AMERICA RUTHERFORD RYAN THEN HEAD OF THE LOBBY MADE SURE THAT MEDICAL LOBBY GOT ALL THE CREDIT BY THE TIME THE WORLD RECOVERED AMERICA RAN IT
AND YOU'VE DECIDED YOUR PRECIOUS LOBBY WON'T SAVE YOU SHE DROPPED HER EYES THEN RAISED THEM TO MEET HIS DEFIANTLY I'M NOT JUST SCARED AND SELFISH DAD CAUGHT IT TOO AND IT MUST BE CLOSE TO THE TIME FOR HIM
AND PILED INTO HIS BUNK SWALLOWING ONE OF THE TABLETS OF MORPHETAL THE SHIP FURNISHED ACCELERATION HAD ENDED
BUT THE WILL TO BE HIMSELF WAS STRONGER THAN LOGIC AND BIT BY BIT HE FORCED THE FEAR AND HORROR AWAY FROM HIM UNTIL HE COULD EXAMINE HIS SITUATION HE WAS SPINNING SLOWLY SO THAT STARS AHEAD OF HIM SEEMED TO CRAWL ACROSS HIS VIEW
MANAGED TO OVERCOME ITS SAFETY DEVICES AND THEN PULLED THE TRIGGER WITH THE GUN POINTED THE WRONG WAY CHRIS FELDMAN AND HARNETT FROM PUBLIC RELATIONS HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM ON THE TRIP THEY WERE SITTING IN A NEARBY CAR WHILE FELDMAN ENJOYED THE SCENERY
THERE WAS NEITHER FRIENDLINESS NOR HOSTILITY IN HIS GLANCE HIS WORDS WERE COURTEOUS AS DOC MOTIONED TOWARD THE TRAY OF BREAKFAST I'VE ALREADY EATEN THANK YOU HE ACCEPTED A CHAIR HIS VOICE WAS APOLOGETIC WHEN HE BEGAN
THE MAN WHO READ OF NOTHING BEYOND SEX CRIMES COULD VOTE ON THE GREAT POLITICAL ISSUES OF THE WORLD NO ABILITY WAS NEEDED FOR HIS VOTE IN FACT HE WAS ASSURED THAT VOTING ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM A FINE AND NOBLE CITIZEN HE LOVED THAT
EVERY FILM HE HAD SEEN ON SPACE SEEMED TO FORM A MAD JUMBLE IN HIS MIND BUT HE SEIZED ON THE FIRST IDEA HE COULD REMEMBER HE INHALED DEEPLY AND YANKED THE OXYGEN TANK FREE AN AUTOMATIC SEAL ON THE SUIT CUT OFF THE CONNECTION
A SPACESUITED FIGURE SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE TINY AIRLOCK HOLDING A COIL OF ROPE THE ROPE SHOT OUT WELL THROWN BUT IT WAS TOO SHORT IT WOULD PASS WITHIN TEN FEET AND MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN TEN MILES FOR ALL THE GOOD IT WOULD DO HIM
HE BEGAN CRANKING THE LITTLE GYROSCOPE TO SWING THE SHIP IT SAVED FUEL TO TURN WITHOUT POWER
THE SWELLING WAS THERE HE ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS BUT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT BOTH OF YOU MUST HAVE IT CAPTAIN THOUGH IT WON'T MATURE FOR ANOTHER YEAR I'M SORRY THERE'S NO HOPE THEN
A LITTLE SHIP WAS LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY HE RECOGNIZED IT AS A LIFE RAFT NOW HIS SPIN BROUGHT HIM AROUND TO FACE IT AND HE SAW IT WAS PARALLELLING HIS COURSE
AT TIMES THE FEAR GREW IN HIM BUT HE MASTERED IT THERE WAS HALF AN HOUR LEFT WHEN HE BEGAN OPENING THE LITTLE BOTTLES AND MAKING HIS FILMS HE WAS STILL NOT FINISHED WHEN STEPS ECHOED DOWN THE HALL BUT HE WAS REASONABLY SURE OF HIS RESULTS
HE STARTED THE TRACTOR OFF AT FULL SPEED BACK TO THE WASTELANDS WHILE DOC STARED AT THE ARMED MEN WHO WERE RIDING THE TRACTORS JAKE CAUGHT HIS LOOK AND NODDED YOU'RE IN ENEMY TERRITORY DOC
ACCORDING TO THE BOOKLET THE SHIP WAS SIMPLE TO OPERATE IT WAS SELF LEVELING IN AN ATMOSPHERE AND AUTOMATIC FLARE COMPUTERS WERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR AN AMATEUR TO JUDGE THE RATE OF DESCENT NEAR THE SURFACE IT LOOKED REASSURING AND WAS PROBABLY WRITTEN WITH THAT IN MIND
THEY WORKED OUT A SYSTEM OF SUBCONTRACTS THAT SPREAD THE PROFITS SO WIDE THAT HARDLY A COMPANY OF ANY SIZE IN THE COUNTRY WASN'T GETTING A SHARE THUS A LOT OF PATRIOTIC NOBLE VOTERS GOT THEIR PAY FROM COMPANIES IN THE LOBBY BLOCK
SHE POINTED TO THE MESSAGE UNDERLINING WORDS WITH HER FINGER FOURTEEN YEARS YOU COULDN'T HAVE CAUSED IT HIGHLY FATAL AND PEOPLE ARE BEING TOLD IT'S ONLY A SKIN DISEASE RESEARCH BEGINNING BUT YOU'VE ALREADY DONE MOST OF THE RESEARCH I CAN SEE THAT NOW
WHILE THE BLAST LASHED OUT THEN THEY WERE IN THE OUTER FRINGES OF THE SKY AND THE BLAST WAS BEGINNING TO SHOW A CORONA THAT RUINED VISIBILITY HE TURNED TO THE FLARE COMPUTER AND BACK TO WHAT HE COULD SEE THROUGH THE QUARTZ VIEWPORT
LEAVING A SMALL MARGIN FOR A BAD LANDING THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SECOND ATTEMPT BUT WITH LESS PRACTICE THAN HE WANTED HE HAD LOCATED JAKE'S VILLAGE THROUGH THE LITTLE TELESCOPE WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED FOR THE MAIN BLAST CONTROL
OR WHO LOOKED MOST LIKE WHAT HIS LIMITED DREAMS FELT TO BE A FATHER IMAGE OR SON IMAGE OR HERO IMAGE HE NEVER BOTHERED LATER TO SEE HOW THE MEN HE'D ELECTED HAD HANDLED THE JOBS HE HAD GIVEN THEM SOMEONE HAD TO LOOK OF COURSE AND SOMEONE DID
AS NEARLY AS HE COULD JUDGE THE COMPUTER SEEMED TO WORK AS IT SHOULD THE SPEED WAS WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LIMITS
IT WAS TO BE A GALA WEEKEND IT WAS THEN THAT BAXTER SHOT HIMSELF BAXTER HAD BEEN FELDMAN'S CLOSEST FRIEND IN THE LOBBY HE'D COME ALONG TO HANDLE PRESS RELATIONS AND HAD GOTTEN ROMANTIC ABOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE
CHRIS SWORE HARSHLY AND BEAT HER FISTS AGAINST THE BOLE OF A TREE BUT BAXTER LIVED HE RECOVERED COMPLETELY AND WAS SHOCKED AT THE HEINOUS THING THAT HAD BEEN DONE TO HIM
AND WHEN THE REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAD BEEN PICKED FOR EVERYTHING BUT THEIR GRASP OF SCIENCE AND GOVERNMENT WENT INTO PANIC OVER A MYTH OF NATIONAL PRESTIGE THE SPACE EFFORT WAS TURNED OVER TO THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY
THE FLARE BLOOMED AND HE YANKED DOWN ON THE LITTLE LEVER IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE THEY HIT THE GROUND BOUNCED TWICE AND TURNED OVER THE SHIP WAS A MESS WHEN FELDMAN FREED HIMSELF FROM THE ELASTIC STRAPS OF THE SEAT
AND BEGAN STRAPPING DOWN SO THAT THE RUSH OF AIR WOULD NOT SWEEP HIM OUTWARD WHEN THE OTHER SEAL WAS RELEASED DOC HAD SAVED ONE BRACKY WEED NOW HE RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS FUMBLING FOR A LIGHT
AS THERE HAD BEEN A SENATE UNDER THE ROMAN CAESARS BUT THE TWO LOBBIES RAN THEMSELVES AS THEY CHOSE THE REAL GOVERNMENT HAD BECOME A KIND OF OLIGARCHY AS IT ALWAYS DID AFTER TOO MUCH FALSE DEMOCRACY RUINED THE IDEALS OF REAL AND PRACTICAL SELF RULE
THE RULE WAS NOW AN ABSOLUTE ETHIC OF MEDICINE IT ALSO MADE FOR BETTER FEES FELDMAN'S FATHER HAD STUCK BY THE RULE BUT HAD QUESTIONED IT FELDMAN LEARNED NOT TO QUESTION IN MEDICAL SCHOOL HE SCORED SECOND IN MEDICAL ETHICS ONLY
JUST AS HIS LUNGS SEEMED ABOUT TO BURST HE COULDN'T HOLD ON LONG ENOUGH TO TIE THE ROPE HIS LUNGS GAVE UP SUDDENLY COLLAPSING AND THEN SUCKING IN GREEDILY CLEAN AIR RUSHED IN LETTING HIS HEAD CLEAR
CHRIS HAD SHRIEKED AS THEY HIT BUT SHE WAS UNBUCKLING HERSELF NOW HE THREW HER HER SPACESUIT AND ONE OF THE EMERGENCY BOTTLES OF OXYGEN FROM THE RACK HURRY UP WITH THAT
THE MAN CAUGHT DOC AND HELD HIM AGAINST THE OUTER SEAL THE RED LIGHT BLINKED FOUR SECONDS THREE TWO THERE WAS A SUDDEN HEAVY THUDDING SOUND AND THE IROQUOIS SEEMED TO JERK SIDEWAYS SLIGHTLY
THEY HAD VERY LITTLE TO WORRY ABOUT FOR THAT FOR SECURITY AND THE RIGHT NOT TO THINK MOST PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE SOME RULES SEEMED HARSH OF COURSE
THE SHIP PHYSICIAN BELIEVES MISSUS EVERTS MAY HAVE THE PLAGUE BUT ISN'T SURE OF THE SYMPTOMS I
HE FLIPPED THE SWITCH WHILE REACHING FOR THE COFFEE CAPTAIN EVERTS THE SPEAKER SAID MAY I JOIN YOU IN YOUR CABIN COME AHEAD FELDMAN INVITED HE CUT OFF THE SWITCH AND GLANCED AT THE CLOCK ON THE WALL THERE WERE LESS THAN ELEVEN HOURS LEFT TO HIM
AND COULD BE PANICKED BY THE LOBBY AT THE FIRST MENTION OF RECESSION SO SPACE LOBBY TOOK OVER COMPLETELY IN ITS OWN FIELD IT DEVELOPED ENOUGH PRESSURE TO GET WHATEVER APPROPRIATIONS IT WANTED EVEN OVER PRESIDENTIAL VETO IT CREATED THE ONLY SPACE EXPERTS
I CAN'T PROVE MY MOTIVES YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO BELIEVE ME BUT IT WASN'T HARD TO DO WHAT I'VE DONE THAT SHUTTLE PILOT WAS FOUND IN A ROUTINE CHECK STOWED AWAY ON THE LIFE RAFT I WAS WITH CAPTAIN EVERTS WHEN HE WAS FOUND SO I DISCOVERED HOW TO GET INTO THE RAFT
THE SHUTTLE LIFTED SLUGGISHLY BUT THERE WAS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY DOC COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS EVEN SOME FUEL REMAINING WHEN THEY SLIPPED INTO THE TUBE AT THE ORBITAL STATION CHRIS WENT OUT AND OTHER GUARDS CAME IN TO FREE HIM
AND I'LL SPREAD IT IN EVERY ONE OF OUR MEDIA I'LL HAVE TO IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO RETAIN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE THERE'D BE A LEAK WITH ALL THE GUIDES AND OTHERS HERE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT I LIKE YOU YOU HAVE COLOR BUT TOUCH THAT WOUND
THAT KIND OF TALK DIDN'T GET FAR PEOPLE WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT RIGHTS NOT ABOUT DUTIES THEY TOOK THE PHRASE THAT ALL MEN WERE CREATED EQUAL AND LEFT OUT THE IMPLIED KICKER THAT EQUALITY WAS IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND BEFORE THE LAW
BUT THANK YOU HE GOT TO HIS FEET AND LEFT AS QUIETLY AND ERECTLY AS HE HAD ENTERED DOC TORE UP HIS NOTES BITTERLY HE PACED HIS CABIN SLOWLY READING OUT THE HOURS WHILE HIS EYES LINGERED ON THE LITTLE BOTTLE OF CULTURES
IF HE BOTHERED TO VOTE AT ALL THAT YEAR HE BECAME A GREAT MAN BY LISTING HIS UNTHOUGHT HUNGRY DESIRE FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY SO HE WENT OUT AND VOTED FOR THE MAN WHO PROMISED HIM MOST
CONVERT FELDMAN FOUGHT FOR CONTROL OF HIMSELF FORCED HIMSELF TO THINK TO HOLD ONTO HIS SANITY
ORGANIZED SPECIAL INTERESTS STEPPED IN WHERE THE MOB HAD FAILED LOBBIES GREW UP THERE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PRESSURE GROUPS BUT NOW THEY DEVELOPED INTO A THIRD ARM OF THE GOVERNMENT THE OLD FARM LOBBY WAS UNBEATABLE
DOC WONDERED ABOUT THE PHYSICIAN APPARENTLY THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN WHO PLACED HIS PATIENTS ABOVE ANYTHING ELSE THOUGH HE WAS PROBABLY METICULOUS ABOUT OBEYING ALL ACTUAL RULES THERE WAS NO LAW AGAINST LISTENING TO A PARIAH AT LEAST
IN RETURN HE AGREED TO FOLLOW THAT PERIOD BY BECOMING AN ADMINISTRATOR A DOCTOR'S DOCTOR AS THEY PUT IT THEY WERE MARRIED IN APRIL AND HIS OFFICE WAS READY IN MAY COMPLETE WITH A STAFF OF EIGHTY THE PUBLICITY RELEASES HAD GONE OUT
HE AIMED THE HISSING BOTTLE FUMBLING FOR THE MANUAL VALVE IT ALMOST WORKED IT KICKED HIM TOWARD THE ROPE SLIGHTLY BUT MOST OF THE ENERGY WAS WASTED IN SETTING HIM INTO A WILDER SPIN HE BLINKED TRYING TO SPOT THE ROPE
FINALLY HE REACHED FOR THE CONTROL HOPING HE'D FIGURED HIS LANDING ORBIT REASONABLY WELL BY SIMPLE LOGIC HE SMOOTHED IT OUT IN THE FOLLOWING HOURS AS HE WATCHED THE MARKINGS ON MARS WHEN THEY WERE NEAR TURNOVER POINT
I CAME ALONG TO SEE YOU KILLED AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL SAVING YOU WASN'T IN MY ORDERS HE GRUNTED AND REACHED FOR THE HANDLE THAT WOULD RELEASE THE OUTER LOCK
BUT FINALLY HE RECEIVED A SURLY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT STEWARD WHATCHA WANT HOW'S THE CHANCE OF GETTING SOME FOOD YOU'RE ON FIRST CLASS THEY COULD AFFORD IT DOC DECIDED HE WOULDN'T COST THEM MUCH
ONLY A MIRACLE HAD SAVED HIM FROM INSTANT DEATH THE BULLET HAD STRUCK A RIB BEEN DEFLECTED AND ROBBED OF SOME OF ITS ENERGY AND HAD BARELY REACHED THE HEART BUT IT HAD PIERCED THE PERICARDIUM AS BEST FELDMAN COULD GUESS AND IT COULD BE FATAL
THEN THERE WAS A LONG WAIT BEFORE A THIRD TRY WAS MADE HE ESTIMATED THE COURSE IT WOULD MISS HIM BY A GOOD HUNDRED FEET BUT IT WAS PROBABLY THE BEST THE AMATEUR PILOT COULD DO THE SHIP DRIFTED CLOSER BUT TO ONE SIDE IT WOULD SOON PASS HIM COMPLETELY
IT WIPED OUT TWO BILLION PEOPLE DEPOPULATED AFRICA AND MOST OF ASIA AND WRECKED EUROPE LEAVING ONLY AMERICA COMPARATIVELY SAFE TO TAKE OVER
BETTER CHANGE YOUR METABOLISM BACK TO EARTH NORMAL CAPTAIN EVERTS HE SAID AND HIS VOICE WAS SO NORMAL THAT HE HARDLY RECOGNIZED IT EVERTS EYES WIDENED BRIEFLY THE MAN BOWED FAINTLY THANK YOU
AND I'LL CRUCIFY YOU CHRIS ADDED HER OWN THREATS SHE'D SPENT YEARS MAKING HIM THE OUTLET FOR ALL HER AMBITIONS DENIED BECAUSE WOMEN WERE STILL ONLY SECOND RATE MEMBERS OF MEDICAL LOBBY SHE COULDN'T LET IT GO NOW
RESEARCH BEGINNING IMMEDIATELY PENALTY VIOLATION TOPSECRET DEATH ALL CONCERNED MISSUS EVERTS RATES A TOPSECRET BREAK DOC COMMENTED DRYLY COME OFF IT CHRIS SHE'S THE DAUGHTER OF ELMERS OF SPACE LOBBY CHRIS ANSWERED
THERE WAS A MANUAL LEVER WHICH CHRIS MUST HAVE USED BEFORE IT MIGHT WORK OUT HERE WHERE THERE WAS ROOM TO MANEUVER AND NOTHING TO HIT BUT TRYING TO MAKE A LANDING WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT DAN SHE REPEATED HE SHRUGGED I DON'T KNOW
THEY'VE STARTED RESEARCH TOO LATE AND THEY'LL BE UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE THAT THE REAL BRAINS WON'T HAVE A CHANCE THE TOPSECRET STUFF LOOKS BAD FOR RESEARCH MAYBE THERE'S A CURE IT WORKS IN CULTURE BOTTLES BUT IT MAY FAIL IN PERSON
BOTH PASTS HAD IN COMMON THE GROWTH AND SUDDEN RUIN OF IDEALISM IDEALISM THROUGHOUT HISTORY SOME MEN HAD SOUGHT THE IDEAL AND MOST HAD CALLED IT FREEDOM ONLY FOOLS EXPECTED ABSOLUTE FREEDOM
A SHARP CLICK INTERRUPTED HIM THAT'S ENOUGH STEWARD CAPTAIN EVERTS SPEAKING DOCTOR FELDMAN YOU HAVE MY APOLOGIES UNTIL YOU REACH YOUR DESTINATION YOU ARE MY PASSENGER AND ENTITLED TO EVERY CONSIDERATION OF ANY OTHER PASSENGER EXCEPT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THROUGH THE SHIP
THERE WERE ALSO TIMES WHEN IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER AND WHEN HIS ONLY THOUGHTS WERE FOR THE VILLAGES AND THE PLAGUE THEY BROUGHT HIM THE PAPERS WHERE HE WAS PAINTED AS A MONSTER BESIDE WHOM JACK THE RIPPER AND ALBRECHT DELIER WERE GENTLE AMATEURS
BUT WISE MEN DREAMED UP MANY SYSTEMS OF RELATIVE FREEDOM INCLUDING DEMOCRACY THEY HAD TRIED THAT IN AMERICA AS THE LAST FLING OF THE DREAM IT HAD BEEN A GOOD ATTEMPT TOO THE MEN WHO DREW THE CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN PRETTY PRACTICAL DREAMERS
BUT THE PEOPLE WANTED THEIR TROUBLES HANDLED FREE WHICH MEANT BY GOVERNMENT SPENDING SINCE THAT COULD BE ADDED TO THE NATIONAL DEBT AND THUS DIDN'T SEEM TO COST ANYTHING IT LOST AND EVENTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT PAID MOST MEDICAL COSTS
IT WAS BETTER THAN WASTING HIS TIME IN DREAD HE MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO LEAVE SOME NOTES BEHIND A GONG SOUNDED AND A RED LIGHT WARNED HIM THAT ACCELERATION WAS DUE HE FINISHED WITH HIS BOTTLES PUT THEM INTO THE INCUBATOR
AND THE LITTLE SHIP LEAPED FORWARD WHOEVER WAS HANDLING IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT PILOTING IT PICKED UP TOO MUCH SPEED AT TOO GREAT AN ANGLE AGAIN BLUE SPURTS CAME BUT THIS TIME MATTERS WERE EVEN WORSE
THEY CAME TO THEIR TASK AFTER A BITTER WAR AND A WORSE PERIOD OF WILD CHAOS AND THEY HAD LEARNED WHERE IDEALISM STOPPED AND IDIOCY BEGAN THEY SET UP A REPUBLIC WITH ALL THE ELEMENTS OF DEMOCRACY THAT THEY CONSIDERED SAFE
THE PILOT'S FAREWELL ADDRESSING HIM AS DOCTOR FELDMAN HAD BEEN TOO LOW FOR HER TO HEAR BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT FITTED HER STORY IT WAS PROBABLY A DELIBERATE CLUE TO GIVE HIM HOPE TO ASSURE HIM THE VILLAGES WERE STILL TRYING IT SHOOK HIS CONFIDENCE
DOC DROPPED HIS BRACKY WEED AND FELT THE HELMET SNAP DOWN A HISS OF OXYGEN REACHED HIM AND THE SUIT BALLOONED OUT THERE WAS NO GRAVITY THE TWO MEN HANDED HIM UP EASILY TO THE ONE IN THE AIRLOCK WHILE THE INNER SEAL BEGAN TO CLOSE
ADDRESSED TO MISSUS D E EVERTS AND SIGNED BY ONE OF THE BEST DOCTORS ON THE LOBBY BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGRET CONFIRM DIAGNOSIS TOPSECRET REPEAT TOPSECRET MARTIAN FEVER INCUBATES FOURTEEN YEARS BELIEVED HIGHLY FATAL NO CURE
THIS IS A PERSONAL MATTER WHICH I PERHAPS HAVE NO RIGHT TO BRING UP BUT MY WIFE IS GREATLY WORRIED ABOUT THIS PLAGUE
THE DELAY IN ARRESTING ME THE CHOICE OF MATTHEWS IT WAS ALL TRUE ANGER BEGAN TO GROW IN HER EYES DAN FELDMAN YOU GET INSIDE THIS RAFT IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THE PEOPLE DYING OF THE PLAGUE WHO NEED YOU
SO LONG DOCTOR FELDMAN THE PILOT CALLED SOFTLY AS THEY LED HIM OUT THEN THE GUARDS SHOVED HIM THROUGH THE AIRLOCK INTO THE STATION FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER HE WAS LOCKED INTO ONE OF THE CABINS OF THE IROQUOIS WITH ALL HIS POSSESSIONS STACKED BESIDE HIM
THE SHIP WAS RETREATING FROM HIM ALREADY HUNDREDS OF YARDS AWAY MARS WAS A SHRUNKEN PILL FAR AWAY THEN SOMETHING BLINKED TO ONE SIDE HE TURNED HIS HEAD TO STARE
SHUT UP AND LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO LAND THIS THING HE FOUND THAT THE FUEL TANKS WERE NEARLY FULL BUT THAT STILL DIDN'T LEAVE MUCH MARGIN
DOCTOR FELDMAN IT WAS RIDICULOUS IMPOSSIBLE AND YET THERE WAS A CURIOUS RELIEF AT THE FORMALITY OF IT IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING FROM A PLAY TOO UNREAL TO AFFECT HIS LIFE EVERTS NODDED TO THE MAN HOLDING THE HELMET
NEVER HAVING BEEN OUT OF A CITY BEFORE HE HIRED A GUIDE AND WENT HUNTING EIGHTY MILES BEYOND THE LAST OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION SOMEHOW HE GOT HIS HAND ON A GUN THOUGH ONLY GUIDES WERE SUPPOSED TO TOUCH THEM
THEY HAD NO ASPIRATORS HOWEVER AND THEY COULDN'T COVER MUCH TERRITORY IN THE SPACESUITS THEY WOULD HAVE TO USE IT MEANT HE'D HAVE TO LAND CLOSE TO A VILLAGE WHERE HE WAS KNOWN HE JOCKEYED THE SHIP AROUND BY TRIAL AND ERROR STUDYING THE MANUAL THAT WAS LYING PROMINENTLY ON THE CONTROL PANEL
AND THE PUBLIC RELATIONS LOBBY THAT HANDLED NEWS AND EDUCATION WAS PAID TO BEGIN THE GREATEST BUILD UP ANY YOUNG GENIUS EVER HAD THEY CELEBRATED THAT WITH A LITTLE PARTY OF SOME FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE AND REPORTERS AT RYAN'S LODGE IN CANADA
THEN QUANTITY OF TREATMENT PAID RATHER THAN QUALITY COMPETENCE NO LONGER MATTERED SO MUCH THE LOBBY LOST BUT DIDN'T KNOW IT BECAUSE THE LOWERED STANDARDS OF COMPETENCE IN THE PROFESSION LOWERED THE CALIBER OF MEN RUNNING THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THAT PROFESSION AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE LOBBY
WHICH MEANT THAT THE MEN PLACED IN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO REGULATE IT CAME FROM ITS OWN RANKS THE OTHER LOBBIES LEARNED A LOT FROM SPACE THERE HAD BEEN A MEDICAL LOBBY LONG BEFORE BUT IT HAD BEEN A CONSERVATIVE GROUP MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH PROTECTING MEDICAL AUTONOMY AND ETHICS
THE EJECTION OF THE LIFE RAFT MUST HAVE CAUSED THE THUMP HE'D HEARD BEFORE HE WAS CAST ADRIFT IT MEANT SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO SAVE HIM IT MEANT LIFE HE FLAILED HIS ARMS AND BEAT HIS LEGS TOGETHER
BUT THERE WERE ALSO SIGNS THAT THE LOBBY WAS WORRIED AS IF AFRAID THAT SOME ATTEMPT MIGHT STILL BE MADE TO RESCUE HIM HE'D LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TRIP TO THE AIRPORT AS A WAY OF JUDGING PUBLIC REACTION
TO CHRISTINA RYAN HE HAD NEVER FIGURED WHY SHE SINGLED HIM OUT FOR HER ATTENTIONS BUT HE GLORIED IN BOTH THOSE ATTENTIONS AND THE RESULTS HE BECAME AUTOMATICALLY A RISING YOUNG MAN THE FAVORITE OF THE DAUGHTER OF THE LOBBY PRESIDENT
FELDMAN HAD SET HIS LEGS THE PROBLEM OF HEADING FOR THE GREAT SPACEPORT AND ESCAPE FROM EARTH AND HE LET THEM TAKE HIM WITHOUT FURTHER GUIDANCE HIS MIND WAS WRAPPED UP IN A WHIRL OF THE PAST HIS PAST AND THAT OF THE WHOLE PLANET
AFTER WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A DIFFICULT SET DOWN THE GUARDS TESTED DOC'S MANACLES AND FORCED HIM INTO THE SHUTTLE INSIDE CHRIS WAS WAITING CARRYING AN OFFICIAL AUTOMATIC
DOC FORCED HIS HANDS TO STEADINESS WITH FOOLISH PRIDE AND BEGAN CLIMBING INTO THE SUIT HE REACHED FOR THE HELMET BUT THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD POINTING TO THE OXYGEN GAUGE THERE WOULD BE EXACTLY ONE HOUR'S SUPPLY OF OXYGEN WHEN HE WAS THROWN OUT
WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE ITSELF SUCCESSFULLY EXCEPT UNDER THE STIMULUS OF WAR OR A THREAT OF WAR THE FAILING AIRPLANE INDUSTRY BECAME THE SPACE COMBINE OVERNIGHT AND NOBODY KEPT TRACK OF HOW BIG IT WAS EXCEPT A FEW SHARP OPERATORS
I AM ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS FELDMAN SHOOK HIS HEAD HE'D HEARD OF SUCH MEN BUT HE'D THOUGHT THE SPECIES EXTINCT THE STEWARD BROUGHT HIS FOOD IN A THOROUGHLY CHASTENED MANNER HE MANAGED TO FIND SPACE FOR IT
SUCH AS THE LAW THAT ALL OPERATIONS HAD TO BE PERFORMED IN LOBBY HOSPITALS BUT THAT COULD BE JUSTIFIED IT WAS THE ONLY SAFE KIND OF SURGERY AND THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NO UNSUPERVISED EXPERIMENTATION SUCH AS THAT WHICH SUPPOSEDLY CAUSED THE PLAGUE
IT ALSO TRIED TO PREVENT GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF TREATMENT AND PAYMENT FEELING THAT IT COULDN'T TRUST THE PEOPLE TO KNOW WHERE TO STOP BUT ITS HISTORY WAS A LONG SERIES OF RETREATS IT FOUGHT WHAT IT CALLED SOCIALIZED MEDICINE
THERE WAS STILL TEN SECONDS TO GO ACCORDING TO THE BIG CHRONOMETER THAT HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN THE LOCK THE SPACEMAN USED IT IN TYING THE SACK OF POSSESSIONS FIRMLY TO DOC'S SUIT A RED LIGHT WENT ON
BUT APPARENTLY THE LOBBY HAD NO DESIRE TO TEST THAT THE GUARDS LED HIM UP TO THE ROOF OF THE JAIL WHERE A ROCKET WAS WAITING THE LANDING SPACE WAS TOO SMALL FOR ONE OF THE STATION SHUTTLES BUT A LITTLE NORTHPORT SOUTHPORT SHUTTLE WAS PARKED THERE
AND FURTHER PERSISTING IN SENDING THE SERVANT GIRL FOR A COACH FOR FEAR HE SHOULD BRING ON ANOTHER ATTACK OF HIS DISORDER TO BOTH CONDITIONS NEWMAN WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD PRESENTLY THE COACH CAME
IN WHICH BY THE BYE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DILAPIDATED STATE OF HIS POCKETS HE DEPOSITED EVERYTHING AND WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE CARRIED HIS MONEY IF HE HAD HAD ANY AND THE COACH BEING DISCHARGED HE LED THE WAY INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE MANSION
FROM MISTER RALPH NICKLEBY SAID NEWMAN ANNOUNCING HIS ERRAND WHEN HE GOT UPSTAIRS WITH ALL POSSIBLE BREVITY WE SHALL BE READY DIRECTLY SAID KATE WE HAVE NOT MUCH TO CARRY BUT I FEAR WE MUST HAVE A COACH I'LL GET ONE REPLIED NEWMAN
SAID MISS LA CREEVY I RECOLLECT GETTING THREE YOUNG MILLINERS TO SIT TO ME WHEN I FIRST BEGAN TO PAINT AND I REMEMBER THAT THEY WERE ALL VERY PALE AND SICKLY
MAY PERHAPS SUGGEST IN THIS PLACE THAT THE GOOD COUPLE WOULD BE BETTER LIKENED TO TWO PRINCIPALS IN A SPARRING MATCH WHO WHEN FORTUNE IS LOW AND BACKERS SCARCE WILL CHIVALROUSLY SET TO FOR THE MERE PLEASURE OF THE BUFFETING
THAT THEIR LIBERAL CHARITY THEIR SINGLENESS OF HEART THEIR NOBLE NATURE AND THEIR UNBOUNDED BENEVOLENCE ARE NO CREATIONS OF THE AUTHOR'S BRAIN BUT ARE PROMPTING EVERY DAY AND OFTENEST BY STEALTH
INDEED YOU SHALL NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY I WILL SAID NEWMAN I CAN'T SUFFER YOU TO THINK OF SUCH A THING SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY YOU CAN'T HELP IT SAID NEWMAN NOT HELP IT NO I THOUGHT OF IT AS I CAME ALONG
AND WHAT NO MAN WITH A FAMILY OUGHT TO DO ADDED THE NEIGHBOURS MISTER NICKLEBY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND MOTIONING THEM ALL OUT OF THE ROOM EMBRACED HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND HAVING PRESSED THEM BY TURNS TO HIS LANGUIDLY BEATING HEART
CHARACTERISTICALLY REMARKING THAT ON THE FINE EVENINGS IT WOULD BE A PLEASANT AMUSEMENT FOR HER TO WALK TO THE WEST END TO FETCH HER DAUGHTER HOME AND NO LESS CHARACTERISTICALLY FORGETTING THAT THERE WERE SUCH THINGS AS WET NIGHTS AND BAD WEATHER TO BE ENCOUNTERED
I RECOLLECT HE WAS A JOVIAL RUDDY BROAD FACED MAN THAT WE GOT ACQUAINTED DIRECTLY AND THAT WE TALKED ON ALL KINDS OF SUBJECTS EXCEPT THE SCHOOL WHICH HE SHOWED A GREAT ANXIETY TO AVOID
AND GRADUALLY EXTENDING HIS OPERATIONS UNTIL THEY ASPIRED TO THE COPPER COINAGE OF THIS REALM IN WHICH HE SPECULATED TO CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE NOR DID HE TROUBLE HIS BORROWERS WITH ABSTRACT CALCULATIONS OF FIGURES
WHO ASSISTED TO BRING A BOY INTO THE WORLD OR MIGHT ONE DAY ASSIST PERHAPS TO SEND HIM OUT OF IT IN THE CHEMIST THE ATTORNEY THE BUTCHER THE BAKER THE CANDLESTICK MAKER THE WHOLE ROUND OF CRAFTS AND TRADES THE SCHOOLMASTER EXCEPTED
BUT IT ALWAYS WAS THE WAY AND WAS JUST THE SAME WITH YOUR POOR DEAR FATHER UNLESS I THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING THIS WAS MISSUS NICKLEBY'S USUAL COMMENCEMENT OF A GENERAL LAMENTATION RUNNING THROUGH A DOZEN OR SO OF COMPLICATED SENTENCES ADDRESSED TO NOBODY IN PARTICULAR
AND WOULD HAVE BROKEN THE REST OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE BROTHERS ARE NOW DEAD THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER POINT ON WHICH I WOULD DESIRE TO OFFER A REMARK IF NICHOLAS BE NOT ALWAYS FOUND TO BE BLAMELESS OR AGREEABLE
AND SEEMS AS IF SOME BLIGHT HAD FALLEN ON IT IF I WERE SUPERSTITIOUS I SHOULD BE ALMOST INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT SOME DREADFUL CRIME HAD BEEN PERPETRATED WITHIN THESE OLD WALLS AND THAT THE PLACE HAD NEVER PROSPERED SINCE HOW FROWNING AND HOW DARK IT LOOKS
HAVING BEEN UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH A FEW MONTHS BEFORE TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A POOR RELATION TO WHOM HE PAID A WEEKLY ALLOWANCE OF THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE HE HAD IN A FIT OF VERY NATURAL EXASPERATION
AND LEFT IT ALL TO MISTER GODFREY NICKLEBY WITH A SPECIAL MENTION OF HIS INDIGNATION NOT ONLY AGAINST THE SOCIETY FOR SAVING THE POOR RELATION'S LIFE BUT AGAINST THE POOR RELATION ALSO FOR ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE SAVED
LORD MY DEAR REPLIED MISSUS NICKLEBY DON'T TALK IN THAT WAY OR YOU'LL FRIGHTEN ME TO DEATH IT IS ONLY MY FOOLISH FANCY MAMA SAID KATE FORCING A SMILE WELL THEN MY LOVE I WISH YOU WOULD KEEP YOUR FOOLISH FANCY TO YOURSELF
FOR GOLD CONJURES UP A MIST ABOUT A MAN MORE DESTRUCTIVE OF ALL HIS OLD SENSES AND LULLING TO HIS FEELINGS THAN THE FUMES OF CHARCOAL IT BROUGHT ALONG WITH IT A COMPANION THOUGHT THAT IF THEY WERE INTIMATE HE WOULD WANT TO BORROW MONEY OF HIM
NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABRUPTNESS OF HIS SPEECH LOOKED AT HIM MORE CLOSELY SHE RECOLLECTED HAVING CAUGHT A PASSING GLIMPSE OF THAT STRANGE FIGURE BEFORE EXCUSE MY CURIOSITY SHE SAID BUT DID I NOT SEE YOU IN THE COACHYARD ON THE MORNING MY BROTHER WENT AWAY TO YORKSHIRE
AND THAT IT IS LAWFUL AND JUST TO COMPASS THEIR ACQUISITION BY ALL MEANS SHORT OF FELONY AND REASONED RALPH WITH HIMSELF IF NO GOOD CAME OF MY UNCLE'S MONEY WHEN HE WAS ALIVE
AS HE HAD NOT TOO MUCH TO EAT WITH IT SEEMED A KIND OF SATIRE UPON HIS HAVING BEEN BORN WITHOUT THAT USEFUL ARTICLE OF PLATE IN HIS MOUTH MISTER GODFREY NICKLEBY COULD AT FIRST SCARCELY BELIEVE THE TIDINGS THUS CONVEYED TO HIM ON EXAMINATION HOWEVER
WAS THERE ANY LARGE SCHOOL NEAR I ASKED HIM IN REFERENCE TO THE LETTER OH YES HE SAID THERE WAS A PRATTY BIG UN WAS IT A GOOD ONE I ASKED
AND THE PUBLISHED SKETCH DOES NOT RESEMBLE HIM WHOEVER HE MAY BE IN ANY OTHER RESPECT STILL HE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS KNOW AT ONCE FOR WHOM IT IS MEANT BECAUSE THE CHARACTER IS SO LIKE HIM
THERE'S NICHOLAS PURSUED THE LADY QUITE A YOUNG MAN IT'S TIME HE WAS IN THE WAY OF DOING SOMETHING FOR HIMSELF AND KATE TOO POOR GIRL WITHOUT A PENNY IN THE WORLD THINK OF YOUR BROTHER
AND FELL TO LOOKING AT THE FIRE STARING ROUND THE ROOM AND WHISTLING A LITTLE ON MY REVERTING TO SOME OTHER TOPIC THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCUSSING HE RECOVERED IMMEDIATELY BUT THOUGH I TRIED HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN I NEVER APPROACHED THE QUESTION OF THE SCHOOL
WOULD HE BE WHAT HE IS IF HE HADN'T SPECULATED THAT'S TRUE REPLIED MISTER NICKLEBY VERY GOOD MY DEAR YES I WILL SPECULATE MY DEAR SPECULATION IS A ROUND GAME
OR FILLED THE RUSTY KETTLE ON THE HOB OR COLLECTED THE WOODCHIPS FROM THE WHARF OR BEGGED THE COALS BUT THE NOTION OF RALPH NICKLEBY HAVING DIRECTED IT TO BE DONE TICKLED HIS FANCY SO MUCH
AS THE DECEASED HAD TAKEN NO FURTHER NOTICE OF HIS NEPHEW IN HIS LIFETIME THAN SENDING TO HIS ELDEST BOY WHO HAD BEEN CHRISTENED AFTER HIM ON DESPERATE SPECULATION A SILVER SPOON IN A MOROCCO CASE WHICH
ALTHOUGH ANY MAN WHO HAD PROVED HIS UNFITNESS FOR ANY OTHER OCCUPATION IN LIFE WAS FREE WITHOUT EXAMINATION OR QUALIFICATION TO OPEN A SCHOOL ANYWHERE ALTHOUGH PREPARATION FOR THE FUNCTIONS HE UNDERTOOK WAS REQUIRED IN THE SURGEON
AS THE JARRING ECHOES OF THE HEAVY HOUSE DOOR CLOSING ON ITS LATCH REVERBERATED DISMALLY THROUGH THE BUILDING KATE FELT HALF TEMPTED TO CALL HIM BACK AND BEG HIM TO REMAIN A LITTLE WHILE BUT SHE WAS ASHAMED TO OWN HER FEARS
IN VERY SEVERE WINTER TIME WHICH IS PRETTY FAITHFULLY DESCRIBED HEREIN AS I WANTED TO SEE A SCHOOLMASTER OR TWO AND WAS FOREWARNED THAT THOSE GENTLEMEN MIGHT IN THEIR MODESTY BE SHY OF RECEIVING A VISIT FROM THE AUTHOR OF THE PICKWICK PAPERS
REFRESHES HIS DAZZLED SIGHT BY LOOKING UPON A DARKER AND MORE SOMBRE TINT BUT EVERYTHING THAT MET MISTER NICKLEBY'S GAZE WORE SO BLACK AND GLOOMY A HUE THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BEYOND DESCRIPTION REFRESHED BY THE VERY REVERSE OF THE CONTRAST
IN ONE WERE A FEW CHAIRS A TABLE AN OLD HEARTH RUG AND SOME FADED BAIZE AND A FIRE WAS READY LAID IN THE GRATE IN THE OTHER STOOD AN OLD TENT BEDSTEAD AND A FEW SCANTY ARTICLES OF CHAMBER FURNITURE
OH THAT'S NOT A GENERAL RULE BY ANY MEANS OBSERVED MISSUS NICKLEBY FOR I REMEMBER AS WELL AS IF IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY EMPLOYING ONE THAT I WAS PARTICULARLY RECOMMENDED TO TO MAKE ME A SCARLET CLOAK AT THE TIME WHEN SCARLET CLOAKS WERE FASHIONABLE
SO YOUR ARGUMENT GOES FOR NOTHING IN THIS MANNER AND WITH LIKE POWERFUL REASONING DID THE WORTHY MATRON MEET EVERY LITTLE OBJECTION THAT PRESENTED ITSELF TO THE NEW SCHEME OF THE MORNING HAPPY MISSUS NICKLEBY
A THIRD PERFECTLY REMEMBERS BEING WAITED ON LAST JANUARY TWELVE MONTH BY TWO GENTLEMEN ONE OF WHOM HELD HIM IN CONVERSATION WHILE THE OTHER TOOK HIS LIKENESS AND ALTHOUGH MISTER SQUEERS HAS BUT ONE EYE AND HE HAS TWO
WHO TAKING IT INTO HIS HEAD RATHER LATE IN LIFE THAT HE MUST GET MARRIED AND NOT BEING YOUNG ENOUGH OR RICH ENOUGH TO ASPIRE TO THE HAND OF A LADY OF FORTUNE HAD WEDDED AN OLD FLAME OUT OF MERE ATTACHMENT WHO IN HER TURN
INASMUCH AS MY FATHER HAS GOT IT NOW AND IS SAVING IT UP FOR ME WHICH IS A HIGHLY VIRTUOUS PURPOSE AND GOING BACK TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN GOOD DID COME OF IT TO HIM TOO FOR HE HAD THE PLEASURE OF THINKING OF IT ALL HIS LIFE LONG
AND SHE HAD A VERY RED FACE A VERY RED FACE INDEED PERHAPS SHE DRANK SUGGESTED MISS LA CREEVY I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT MAY HAVE BEEN RETURNED MISSUS NICKLEBY BUT I KNOW SHE HAD A VERY RED FACE
IS MOST INCREDULOUS IN WHAT PROFESSES TO BE IMAGINARY AND THAT WHILE EVERY DAY IN REAL LIFE IT WILL ALLOW IN ONE MAN NO BLEMISHES AND IN ANOTHER NO VIRTUES
SOME BONES OF ANIMALS FRAGMENTS OF IRON HOOPS AND STAVES OF OLD CASKS LAY STREWN ABOUT BUT NO LIFE WAS STIRRING THERE IT WAS A PICTURE OF COLD SILENT DECAY THIS HOUSE DEPRESSES AND CHILLS ONE SAID KATE
HE WAS ENABLED TO LEAVE TO HIS ELDEST SON RALPH THREE THOUSAND POUNDS IN CASH AND TO HIS YOUNGEST SON NICHOLAS ONE THOUSAND AND THE FARM WHICH WAS AS SMALL A LANDED ESTATE AS ONE WOULD DESIRE TO SEE
I'VE HAD THE GOUT NEWMAN WAS VERY VERY FAR FROM HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF A GOUTY SUBJECT AND SO KATE COULD NOT HELP THINKING BUT THE CONFERENCE WAS CUT SHORT BY MISSUS NICKLEBY'S INSISTING ON HAVING THE DOOR SHUT LEST MISTER NOGGS SHOULD TAKE COLD
CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCES ALL THE REST THERE ONCE LIVED IN A SEQUESTERED PART OF THE COUNTY OF DEVONSHIRE ONE MISTER GODFREY NICKLEBY A WORTHY GENTLEMAN
AND IN ONE RESPECT INDEED THIS COMPARISON WOULD HOLD GOOD FOR AS THE ADVENTUROUS PAIR OF THE FIVES COURT WILL AFTERWARDS SEND ROUND A HAT AND TRUST TO THE BOUNTY OF THE LOOKERS ON FOR THE MEANS OF REGALING THEMSELVES
THEY FORMED THE WORTHY CORNERSTONE OF A STRUCTURE WHICH FOR ABSURDITY AND A MAGNIFICENT HIGH MINDED LAISSEZ ALLER NEGLECT HAS RARELY BEEN EXCEEDED IN THE WORLD WE HEAR SOMETIMES OF AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES AGAINST THE UNQUALIFIED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER
THIS FIT OF WANDERING PAST HE SOLEMNLY COMMENDED THEM TO ONE WHO NEVER DESERTED THE WIDOW OR HER FATHERLESS CHILDREN AND SMILING GENTLY ON THEM TURNED UPON HIS FACE AND OBSERVED
SO MISTER GODFREY NICKLEBY AND HIS PARTNER THE HONEYMOON BEING OVER LOOKED OUT WISTFULLY INTO THE WORLD RELYING IN NO INCONSIDERABLE DEGREE UPON CHANCE FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR MEANS
OR PERMITTING HIS FACULTIES TO RUST EVEN AT THAT EARLY AGE IN MERE ABSTRACT SPECULATIONS THIS PROMISING LAD COMMENCED USURER ON A LIMITED SCALE AT SCHOOL PUTTING OUT AT GOOD INTEREST A SMALL CAPITAL OF SLATE PENCIL AND MARBLES
WHICH NOBODY WHO HAS WORKED SUMS IN SIMPLE INTEREST CAN FAIL TO HAVE FOUND MOST EMBARRASSING BY ESTABLISHING THE ONE GENERAL RULE THAT ALL SUMS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST SHOULD BE PAID ON POCKET MONEY DAY THAT IS TO SAY ON SATURDAY
THAT HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM CRACKING ALL HIS TEN FINGERS IN SUCCESSION AT WHICH PERFORMANCE MISSUS NICKLEBY WAS RATHER STARTLED AT FIRST BUT SUPPOSING IT TO BE IN SOME REMOTE MANNER CONNECTED WITH THE GOUT DID NOT REMARK UPON
FROM WHAT WE HAVE SAID OF THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND THE NATURAL ADMIRATION THE READER WILL IMMEDIATELY CONCEIVE OF HIS CHARACTER IT MAY PERHAPS BE INFERRED THAT HE IS TO BE THE HERO OF THE WORK WHICH WE SHALL PRESENTLY BEGIN TO SET THIS POINT AT REST
AND THAT WHETHER A LOAN WERE CONTRACTED ON THE MONDAY OR ON THE FRIDAY THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST SHOULD BE IN BOTH CASES THE SAME INDEED HE ARGUED AND WITH GREAT SHOW OF REASON THAT IT OUGHT TO BE RATHER MORE FOR ONE DAY THAN FOR FIVE
TO KEEP THE LATTLE BOY FROM A SIKE SCOONDRELS WHILE THERE'S A HARSE TO HOOLD IN A LUNNUN OR A GOOTTHER TO LIE ASLEEP IN REPEATING THESE WORDS WITH GREAT HEARTINESS AND WITH A SOLEMNITY ON HIS JOLLY FACE THAT MADE IT LOOK TWICE AS LARGE AS BEFORE
I MAKE MENTION OF THE RACE AS OF THE YORKSHIRE SCHOOLMASTERS IN THE PAST TENSE THOUGH IT HAS NOT YET FINALLY DISAPPEARED IT IS DWINDLING DAILY A LONG DAY'S WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE ABOUT US IN THE WAY OF EDUCATION HEAVEN KNOWS
SO MISTER RALPH NICKLEBY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID THINGS WERE BETTER AS THEY WERE AS FOR NICHOLAS HE LIVED A SINGLE MAN ON THE PATRIMONIAL ESTATE UNTIL HE GREW TIRED OF LIVING ALONE
VERY SAID NEWMAN I'LL TELL HIM SO IT WAS NO VERY EASY MATTER TO MISTAKE NEWMAN NOGGS AFTER HAVING ONCE SEEN HIM AND AS KATE ATTRACTED BY THE SINGULARITY OF HIS MANNER IN WHICH ON THIS OCCASION HOWEVER THERE WAS SOMETHING RESPECTFUL AND EVEN DELICATE
WHERE IMPOSTURE IGNORANCE AND BRUTAL CUPIDITY ARE THE STOCK IN TRADE OF A SMALL BODY OF MEN AND ONE IS DESCRIBED BY THESE CHARACTERISTICS ALL HIS FELLOWS WILL RECOGNISE SOMETHING BELONGING TO THEMSELVES
WHO WAS A SLOW AND TIME TAKING SPEAKER IF WE SHOULD LOSE IT WE SHALL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO LIVE MY DEAR FIDDLE SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY I AM NOT ALTOGETHER SURE OF THAT MY DEAR SAID MISTER NICKLEBY
OF MILLINERS WHO HAD BEEN POSSESSED OF CONSIDERABLE PROPERTY THOUGH WHETHER THEY HAD ACQUIRED IT ALL IN BUSINESS OR HAD HAD A CAPITAL TO START WITH OR HAD BEEN LUCKY AND MARRIED TO ADVANTAGE SHE COULD NOT EXACTLY REMEMBER HOWEVER
MORE EASILY ACQUIRED AND RETAINED IN THE MEMORY THAN ANY KNOWN RULE OF ARITHMETIC CANNOT BE TOO STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO THE NOTICE OF CAPITALISTS BOTH LARGE AND SMALL AND MORE ESPECIALLY OF MONEY BROKERS AND BILL DISCOUNTERS INDEED
AND AFTER MANY SORROWFUL FAREWELLS AND A GREAT DEAL OF RUNNING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ACROSS THE PAVEMENT ON THE PART OF MISS LA CREEVY IN THE COURSE OF WHICH THE YELLOW TURBAN CAME INTO VIOLENT CONTACT WITH SUNDRY FOOT PASSENGERS IT
PERPETRATION OF WHICH UPON NEGLECTED OR REPUDIATED CHILDREN THESE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN THE MAIN INSTRUMENTS VERY FAR EXCEEDING ANY THAT APPEAR IN THESE PAGES THIS COMPRISES ALL I NEED SAY ON THE SUBJECT
MISTER NICKLEBY'S INCOME AT THE PERIOD OF HIS MARRIAGE FLUCTUATED BETWEEN SIXTY AND EIGHTY POUNDS PER ANNUM THERE ARE PEOPLE ENOUGH IN THE WORLD HEAVEN KNOWS AND EVEN IN LONDON WHERE MISTER NICKLEBY DWELT IN THOSE DAYS
NEWMAN DARTED A MEANING GLANCE AT KATE AND REPLIED WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON THE LAST WORD OF HIS ANSWER THAT MISTER RALPH NICKLEBY WAS WELL AND SENT HIS LOVE I AM SURE WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM OBSERVED MISSUS NICKLEBY
THE DOOR AND WINDOWS OF WHICH WERE SO BESPATTERED WITH MUD THAT IT WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN UNINHABITED FOR YEARS THE DOOR OF THIS DESERTED MANSION NEWMAN OPENED WITH A KEY WHICH HE TOOK OUT OF HIS HAT
AS TO HIS HAVING GOOD GROUNDS ON WHICH TO REST AN ACTION FOR LIBEL ANOTHER HAS MEDITATED A JOURNEY TO LONDON
WITH A HEAD FULL OF PARTRIDGE STRAP TOM PIPES AND SANCHO PANZA BUT I KNOW THAT MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THEM WERE PICKED UP AT THAT TIME
AND ATTACH HIMSELF TO THE QUIET ROUTINE OF A COUNTRY LIFE RALPH THE ELDER DEDUCED FROM THE OFTEN REPEATED TALE THE TWO GREAT MORALS THAT RICHES ARE THE ONLY TRUE SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND POWER
IT WILL SELDOM ADMIT A VERY STRONGLY MARKED CHARACTER EITHER GOOD OR BAD IN A FICTITIOUS NARRATIVE TO BE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF PROBABILITY BUT THOSE WHO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THIS TALE WILL BE GLAD TO LEARN THAT THE BROTHERS CHEERYBLE LIVE
I WAS THE POOR LADY'S FRIEND TRAVELLING THAT WAY AND IF THE RECIPIENT OF THE LETTER COULD INFORM ME OF A SCHOOL IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THE WRITER WOULD BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED I WENT TO SEVERAL PLACES IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY
BUT HE CAME DOWN AT NIGHT THROUGH THE SNOW TO THE INN WHERE I WAS STAYING IT WAS AFTER DINNER AND HE NEEDED LITTLE PERSUASION TO SIT DOWN BY THE FIRE IN A WARM CORNER
NOWHERE PRESERVED IN THE REGISTRIES OF THIS COUNTRY MISTER NICKLEBY LOOKED ABOUT HIM FOR THE MEANS OF REPAIRING HIS CAPITAL NOW SADLY REDUCED BY THIS INCREASE IN HIS FAMILY AND THE EXPENSES OF THEIR EDUCATION
THE PLAYERS SEE LITTLE OR NOTHING OF THEIR CARDS AT FIRST STARTING GAINS MAY BE GREAT AND SO MAY LOSSES THE RUN OF LUCK WENT AGAINST MISTER NICKLEBY A MANIA PREVAILED A BUBBLE BURST
VERY KIND INDEED REPLIED KATE LOOKING ROUND NEWMAN NOGGS DID NOT SAY THAT HE HAD HUNTED UP THE OLD FURNITURE THEY SAW FROM ATTIC AND CELLAR OR THAT HE HAD TAKEN IN THE HALFPENNYWORTH OF MILK FOR TEA THAT STOOD UPON A SHELF
TO TURN TO A MORE PLEASANT SUBJECT IT MAY BE RIGHT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE TWO CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK WHICH ARE DRAWN FROM LIFE IT IS REMARKABLE THAT WHAT WE CALL THE WORLD WHICH IS SO VERY CREDULOUS IN WHAT PROFESSES TO BE TRUE
NEWMAN NOGGS BOWING TO THE YOUNG LADY MORE LIKE A GENTLEMAN THAN THE MISERABLE WRETCH HE SEEMED PLACED HIS HAND UPON HIS BREAST AND PAUSING FOR A MOMENT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO STRUGGLES TO SPEAK BUT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT TO SAY QUITTED THE ROOM
TRADERS IN THE AVARICE INDIFFERENCE OR IMBECILITY OF PARENTS AND THE HELPLESSNESS OF CHILDREN IGNORANT SORDID BRUTAL MEN TO WHOM FEW CONSIDERATE PERSONS WOULD HAVE ENTRUSTED THE BOARD AND LODGING OF A HORSE OR A DOG
THIS GOOD LADY BORE HIM TWO CHILDREN A SON AND A DAUGHTER AND WHEN THE SON WAS ABOUT NINETEEN AND THE DAUGHTER FOURTEEN AS NEAR AS WE CAN GUESS IMPARTIAL RECORDS OF YOUNG LADIES AGES BEING BEFORE THE PASSING OF THE NEW ACT
AS SHE VERY LOGICALLY REMARKED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME YOUNG PERSON IN THAT WAY OF BUSINESS WHO HAD MADE A FORTUNE WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING TO BEGIN WITH AND THAT BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED WHY SHOULD NOT KATE DO THE SAME MISS LA CREEVY
I CONSULTED WITH A PROFESSIONAL FRIEND WHO HAD A YORKSHIRE CONNEXION AND WITH WHOM I CONCERTED A PIOUS FRAUD HE GAVE ME SOME LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION IN THE NAME I THINK OF MY TRAVELLING COMPANION
SAID THE APOTHECARY YOU MUSTN'T LET YOURSELF BE CAST DOWN SIR SAID THE NURSE SUCH THINGS HAPPEN EVERY DAY REMARKED THE LAWYER AND IT IS VERY SINFUL TO REBEL AGAINST THEM WHISPERED THE CLERGYMAN
HE SUDDENLY TOOK UP HIS HAT AND LEANING OVER THE TABLE AND LOOKING ME FULL IN THE FACE SAID IN A LOW VOICE WEEL MISTHER WE'VE BEEN VARA PLEASANT TOOGATHER
OR REFERENCES TO READY RECKONERS HIS SIMPLE RULE OF INTEREST BEING ALL COMPRISED IN THE ONE GOLDEN SENTENCE TWO PENCE FOR EVERY HALF PENNY WHICH GREATLY SIMPLIFIED THE ACCOUNTS AND WHICH AS A FAMILIAR PRECEPT
AS ILLUSTRATING THE SECRET CONNECTION AND SYMPATHY WHICH ALWAYS EXIST BETWEEN GREAT MINDS THOUGH MASTER RALPH NICKLEBY WAS NOT AT THAT TIME AWARE OF IT THE CLASS OF GENTLEMEN BEFORE ALLUDED TO PROCEED ON JUST THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN ALL THEIR TRANSACTIONS
TURNING DOWN BY THE RIVER SIDE AND AFTER A LONG AND VERY SLOW DRIVE THE STREETS BEING CROWDED AT THAT HOUR WITH VEHICLES OF EVERY KIND STOPPED IN FRONT OF A LARGE OLD DINGY HOUSE IN THAMES STREET
THERE ARE VERY FEW NOW OF THE MONSTROUS NEGLECT OF EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND THE DISREGARD OF IT BY THE STATE AS A MEANS OF FORMING GOOD OR BAD CITIZENS AND MISERABLE OR HAPPY MEN PRIVATE SCHOOLS LONG AFFORDED A NOTABLE EXAMPLE
A PROJECT HAD BUT TO BE NEW AND IT CAME HOME TO HER MIND BRIGHTLY VARNISHED AND GILDED AS A GLITTERING TOY THIS QUESTION DISPOSED OF KATE COMMUNICATED HER UNCLE'S DESIRE ABOUT THE EMPTY HOUSE
BUT FEW COMPLAINTS PREVAIL OF THE POPULATION BEING SCANTY IT IS EXTRAORDINARY HOW LONG A MAN MAY LOOK AMONG THE CROWD WITHOUT DISCOVERING THE FACE OF A FRIEND BUT IT IS NO LESS TRUE MISTER NICKLEBY LOOKED AND LOOKED
AS NO WRITER OF FICTION WOULD HAVE THE BOLDNESS TO IMAGINE AND THAT SINCE HE HAS BEEN ENGAGED UPON THESE ADVENTURES HE HAS RECEIVED FROM PRIVATE QUARTERS FAR BEYOND THE REACH OF SUSPICION OR DISTRUST ACCOUNTS OF ATROCITIES IN THE
WHICH THIS UNLUCKY PARAGRAPH BROUGHT DOWN UPON ME I SHOULD GET INTO AN ARITHMETICAL DIFFICULTY FROM WHICH I COULD NOT EASILY EXTRICATE MYSELF SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE THE APPLICATIONS FOR LOANS GIFTS
THE AMIABLE OLD GENTLEMAN IT SEEMED HAD INTENDED TO LEAVE THE WHOLE TO THE ROYAL HUMANE SOCIETY AND HAD INDEED EXECUTED A WILL TO THAT EFFECT BUT THE INSTITUTION
HE IS NOT ALWAYS INTENDED TO APPEAR SO HE IS A YOUNG MAN OF AN IMPETUOUS TEMPER AND OF LITTLE OR NO EXPERIENCE
FOUR STOCK BROKERS TOOK VILLA RESIDENCES AT FLORENCE FOUR HUNDRED NOBODIES WERE RUINED AND AMONG THEM MISTER NICKLEBY THE VERY HOUSE I LIVE IN SIGHED THE POOR GENTLEMAN MAY BE TAKEN FROM ME TOMORROW
THAT MISTER SQUEERS AND HIS SCHOOL ARE FAINT AND FEEBLE PICTURES OF AN EXISTING REALITY PURPOSELY SUBDUED AND KEPT DOWN LEST THEY SHOULD BE DEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE UPON RECORD TRIALS AT LAW
AND NOT WAKE UP MY FOOLISH FANCY TO KEEP IT COMPANY RETORTED MISSUS NICKLEBY WHY DIDN'T YOU THINK OF ALL THIS BEFORE YOU ARE SO CARELESS WE MIGHT HAVE ASKED MISS LA CREEVY TO KEEP US COMPANY OR BORROWED A DOG OR A THOUSAND THINGS
HAD TAKEN HIM FOR THE SAME REASON THUS TWO PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PLAY CARDS FOR MONEY SOMETIMES SIT DOWN TO A QUIET GAME FOR LOVE SOME ILL CONDITIONED PERSONS WHO SNEER AT THE LIFE MATRIMONIAL
EVEN IF HE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LAUGH WITHOUT OBSERVING THAT HIS COUNTENANCE FELL AND THAT HE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE
WHILE THE AUTHOR CANNOT BUT FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF THE COMPLIMENT THUS CONVEYED TO HIM HE VENTURES TO SUGGEST THAT THESE CONTENTIONS MAY ARISE FROM THE FACT THAT MISTER SQUEERS IS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A CLASS AND NOT OF AN INDIVIDUAL
FOR ONCE AND FOR EVER WE HASTEN TO UNDECEIVE THEM AND STRIDE TO ITS COMMENCEMENT ON THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER RALPH NICKLEBY WHO HAD BEEN SOME TIME BEFORE PLACED IN A MERCANTILE HOUSE IN LONDON
OR ALL THE WIDE WORLD BESIDES THERE IS NO OTHER HEART THAT TAKES AN INTEREST IN YOUR WELFARE
WE NEED DETAIN YOU NO LONGER I THINK SAID KATE IS THERE NOTHING I CAN DO ASKED NEWMAN NOTHING THANK YOU REJOINED MISS NICKLEBY PERHAPS MY DEAR
OR A GOOTTHER TO LIE ASLEEP IN AR WOULDN'T MAK ILL WORDS AMANG MY NEEBURS AND AR SPEAK TIV'EE QUIET LOIKE
YOU SHALL NOT SHAKE ME OFF FOR ALL THAT REPLIED MISS LA CREEVY WITH AS MUCH SPRIGHTLINESS AS SHE COULD ASSUME I SHALL SEE YOU VERY OFTEN AND COME AND HEAR HOW YOU GET ON
AND EACH WILL HAVE A MISGIVING THAT THE PORTRAIT IS HIS OWN THE AUTHOR'S OBJECT IN CALLING PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE SYSTEM WOULD BE VERY IMPERFECTLY FULFILLED IF HE DID NOT STATE NOW IN HIS OWN PERSON EMPHATICALLY AND EARNESTLY
WERE OF THAT DESPONDING NATURE WHICH THE OCCURRENCES OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CALCULATED TO AWAKEN HER UNCLE'S WAS NOT A MANNER LIKELY TO DISPEL ANY DOUBTS OR APPREHENSIONS SHE MIGHT HAVE FORMED IN THE OUTSET
THAT IS TO SAY THE COACH NOT THE TURBAN WENT AWAY AGAIN WITH THE TWO LADIES AND THEIR LUGGAGE INSIDE AND NEWMAN DESPITE ALL MISSUS NICKLEBY'S ASSURANCES THAT IT WOULD BE HIS DEATH ON THE BOX BESIDE THE DRIVER THEY WENT INTO THE CITY
MISTER NOGGS WOULD LIKE TO DRINK OUR HEALTHS SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY FUMBLING IN HER RETICULE FOR SOME SMALL COIN I THINK MAMA SAID KATE HESITATING AND REMARKING NEWMAN'S AVERTED FACE YOU WOULD HURT HIS FEELINGS IF YOU OFFERED IT
