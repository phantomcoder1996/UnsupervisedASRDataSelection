AND A GUSH OF TEARS SOMEWHAT SOOTHED ME BUT AGAIN WHEN I REFLECTED THAT THEY HAD SPURNED AND DESERTED ME ANGER RETURNED A RAGE OF ANGER
IT WAS A PORTRAIT OF A MOST LOVELY WOMAN IN SPITE OF MY MALIGNITY IT SOFTENED AND ATTRACTED ME FOR A FEW MOMENTS I GAZED WITH DELIGHT ON HER DARK EYES
I WAS LIKE A WILD BEAST THAT HAD BROKEN THE TOILS DESTROYING THE OBJECTS THAT OBSTRUCTED ME AND RANGING THROUGH THE WOOD WITH A STAG LIKE SWIFTNESS OH WHAT A MISERABLE NIGHT I PASSED
BUT IT IS ALL THAT I CAN RECEIVE AND IT SHALL CONTENT ME IT IS TRUE WE SHALL BE MONSTERS CUT OFF FROM ALL THE WORLD BUT ON THAT ACCOUNT WE SHALL BE MORE ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER
SHALL I RESPECT MAN WHEN HE CONDEMNS ME LET HIM LIVE WITH ME IN THE INTERCHANGE OF KINDNESS AND INSTEAD OF INJURY I WOULD BESTOW EVERY BENEFIT UPON HIM WITH TEARS OF GRATITUDE AT HIS ACCEPTANCE
HE CONTINUED YOU MUST CREATE A FEMALE FOR ME WITH WHOM I CAN LIVE IN THE INTERCHANGE OF THOSE SYMPATHIES NECESSARY FOR MY BEING THIS YOU ALONE CAN DO AND I DEMAND IT OF YOU AS A RIGHT
THE CHILD STILL STRUGGLED AND LOADED ME WITH EPITHETS WHICH CARRIED DESPAIR TO MY HEART I GRASPED HIS THROAT TO SILENCE HIM AND IN A MOMENT HE LAY DEAD AT MY FEET
INSTEAD OF VENTING MY SENSATIONS IN EXCLAMATIONS AND AGONY I DID NOT RUSH AMONG MANKIND AND PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THEM WHILE I WAS OVERCOME BY THESE FEELINGS I LEFT THE SPOT WHERE I HAD COMMITTED THE MURDER AND SEEKING A MORE SECLUDED HIDING PLACE
REMEMBER THAT AND TELL ME WHY I SHOULD PITY MAN MORE THAN HE PITIES ME YOU WOULD NOT CALL IT MURDER IF YOU COULD PRECIPITATE ME INTO ONE OF THOSE ICE RIFTS AND DESTROY MY FRAME THE WORK OF YOUR OWN HANDS
I TOOK NO REST BUT RETURNED IMMEDIATELY TO GENEVA EVEN IN MY OWN HEART I COULD GIVE NO EXPRESSION TO MY SENSATIONS THEY WEIGHED ON ME WITH A MOUNTAIN'S WEIGHT AND THEIR EXCESS DESTROYED MY AGONY BENEATH THEM
AND WAITED ANXIOUSLY TO DISCOVER FROM HIS DISCOURSE THE MEANING OF THESE UNUSUAL APPEARANCES DO YOU CONSIDER SAID HIS COMPANION TO HIM THAT YOU WILL BE OBLIGED TO PAY THREE MONTHS RENT AND TO LOSE THE PRODUCE OF YOUR GARDEN
WHICH DIFFERED FROM THAT OF MY PROTECTORS SOON AFTER HOWEVER FELIX APPROACHED WITH ANOTHER MAN I WAS SURPRISED AS I KNEW THAT HE HAD NOT QUITTED THE COTTAGE THAT MORNING
AND WHEN I CONSIDERED WHAT HAD PASSED AT THE COTTAGE I COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING THAT I HAD BEEN TOO HASTY IN MY CONCLUSIONS I HAD CERTAINLY ACTED IMPRUDENTLY
I TREMBLED VIOLENTLY APPREHENDING SOME DREADFUL MISFORTUNE THE INSIDE OF THE COTTAGE WAS DARK AND I HEARD NO MOTION I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE AGONY OF THIS SUSPENSE
WAS QUICKLY ENVELOPED BY THE FLAMES WHICH CLUNG TO IT AND LICKED IT WITH THEIR FORKED AND DESTROYING TONGUES AS SOON AS I WAS CONVINCED THAT NO ASSISTANCE COULD SAVE ANY PART OF THE HABITATION I QUITTED THE SCENE
I KNEW THAT I OUGHT TO HASTEN MY DESCENT TOWARDS THE VALLEY AS I SHOULD SOON BE ENCOMPASSED IN DARKNESS BUT MY HEART WAS HEAVY AND MY STEPS SLOW THE LABOUR OF WINDING AMONG THE LITTLE PATHS OF THE MOUNTAIN
IMMENSE RECESSES CONSUMED BY A BURNING PASSION WHICH YOU ALONE CAN GRATIFY WE MAY NOT PART UNTIL YOU HAVE PROMISED TO COMPLY WITH MY REQUISITION I AM ALONE AND MISERABLE
THE COLD STARS SHONE IN MOCKERY AND THE BARE TREES WAVED THEIR BRANCHES ABOVE ME NOW AND THEN THE SWEET VOICE OF A BIRD BURST FORTH AMIDST THE UNIVERSAL STILLNESS ALL
BUT OF AN AGREEABLE ASPECT AND BLOOMING IN THE LOVELINESS OF YOUTH AND HEALTH HERE I THOUGHT IS ONE OF THOSE WHOSE JOY IMPARTING SMILES ARE BESTOWED ON ALL BUT ME AND THEN I BENT OVER HER AND WHISPERED
I GENERALLY RESTED DURING THE DAY AND TRAVELLED ONLY WHEN I WAS SECURED BY NIGHT FROM THE VIEW OF MAN ONE MORNING HOWEVER FINDING THAT MY PATH LAY THROUGH A DEEP WOOD I VENTURED TO CONTINUE MY JOURNEY AFTER THE SUN HAD RISEN
BUT HOW WAS I TO DIRECT MYSELF I KNEW THAT I MUST TRAVEL IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION TO REACH MY DESTINATION BUT THE SUN WAS MY ONLY GUIDE I DID NOT KNOW THE NAMES OF THE TOWNS THAT I WAS TO PASS THROUGH NOR COULD I ASK
I GAZED ON MY VICTIM AND MY HEART SWELLED WITH EXULTATION AND HELLISH TRIUMPH CLAPPING MY HANDS I EXCLAIMED I TOO CAN CREATE DESOLATION MY ENEMY IS NOT INVULNERABLE
THAT YOU WERE MY FATHER MY CREATOR AND TO WHOM COULD I APPLY WITH MORE FITNESS THAN TO HIM WHO HAD GIVEN ME LIFE AMONG THE LESSONS THAT FELIX HAD BESTOWED UPON SAFIE GEOGRAPHY HAD NOT BEEN OMITTED
SHALL I CREATE ANOTHER LIKE YOURSELF WHOSE JOINT WICKEDNESS MIGHT DESOLATE THE WORLD BEGONE I HAVE ANSWERED YOU YOU MAY TORTURE ME BUT I WILL NEVER CONSENT YOU ARE IN THE WRONG REPLIED THE FIEND
MAN WILL NOT ASSOCIATE WITH ME BUT ONE AS DEFORMED AND HORRIBLE AS MYSELF WOULD NOT DENY HERSELF TO ME MY COMPANION MUST BE OF THE SAME SPECIES AND HAVE THE SAME DEFECTS
SOMETIMES WISHING TO SEE YOU SOMETIMES RESOLVED TO QUIT THE WORLD AND ITS MISERIES FOREVER AT LENGTH I WANDERED TOWARDS THESE MOUNTAINS AND HAVE RANGED THROUGH THEIR
WHICH YOU MUST NOT REFUSE TO CONCEDE THE LATTER PART OF HIS TALE HAD KINDLED ANEW IN ME THE ANGER THAT HAD DIED AWAY WHILE HE NARRATED HIS PEACEFUL LIFE AMONG THE COTTAGERS AND AS HE SAID THIS
SUCH AS WOULD ALONE COMPENSATE FOR THE OUTRAGES AND ANGUISH I HAD ENDURED AFTER SOME WEEKS MY WOUND HEALED AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY
IF THEREFORE I COULD SEIZE HIM AND EDUCATE HIM AS MY COMPANION AND FRIEND I SHOULD NOT BE SO DESOLATE IN THIS PEOPLED EARTH URGED BY THIS IMPULSE I SEIZED ON THE BOY AS HE PASSED AND DREW HIM TOWARDS ME
AND DID I NOT AS HIS MAKER OWE HIM ALL THE PORTION OF HAPPINESS THAT IT WAS IN MY POWER TO BESTOW
I MUST NOT BE TRIFLED WITH AND I DEMAND AN ANSWER IF I HAVE NO TIES AND NO AFFECTIONS HATRED AND VICE MUST BE MY PORTION THE LOVE OF ANOTHER WILL DESTROY THE CAUSE OF MY CRIMES
AND SENT ME FORTH TO THIS INSUPPORTABLE MISERY THE SUN ROSE I HEARD THE VOICES OF MEN AND KNEW THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN TO MY RETREAT DURING THAT DAY
AND CONTINUED IF YOU CONSENT NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING SHALL EVER SEE US AGAIN I WILL GO TO THE VAST WILDS OF SOUTH AMERICA MY FOOD IS NOT THAT OF MAN
SOFT TEARS AGAIN BEDEWED MY CHEEKS AND I EVEN RAISED MY HUMID EYES WITH THANKFULNESS TOWARDS THE BLESSED SUN WHICH BESTOWED SUCH JOY UPON ME
NOT I BUT SHE SHALL SUFFER THE MURDER I HAVE COMMITTED BECAUSE I AM FOREVER ROBBED OF ALL THAT SHE COULD GIVE ME SHE SHALL ATONE THE CRIME HAD ITS SOURCE IN HER
I DO NOT WISH TO TAKE ANY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AND I BEG THEREFORE THAT YOU WILL TAKE SOME DAYS TO CONSIDER OF YOUR DETERMINATION IT IS UTTERLY USELESS REPLIED FELIX WE CAN NEVER AGAIN INHABIT YOUR COTTAGE THE LIFE OF MY FATHER IS IN THE GREATEST DANGER
THESE THOUGHTS CALMED ME AND IN THE AFTERNOON I SANK INTO A PROFOUND SLEEP BUT THE FEVER OF MY BLOOD DID NOT ALLOW ME TO BE VISITED BY PEACEFUL DREAMS THE HORRIBLE SCENE OF THE PRECEDING DAY WAS
FOREVER ACTING BEFORE MY EYES THE FEMALES WERE FLYING AND THE ENRAGED FELIX TEARING ME FROM HIS FATHER'S FEET I AWOKE EXHAUSTED
IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF PLACES MY EVIL PASSIONS WILL HAVE FLED FOR I SHALL MEET WITH SYMPATHY MY LIFE WILL FLOW QUIETLY AWAY AND IN MY DYING MOMENTS I SHALL NOT CURSE MY MAKER
I WAS SCARCELY HID WHEN A YOUNG GIRL CAME RUNNING TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE I WAS CONCEALED LAUGHING AS IF SHE RAN FROM SOMEONE IN SPORT
HATED AND DESPISED EVERY COUNTRY MUST BE EQUALLY HORRIBLE AT LENGTH THE THOUGHT OF YOU CROSSED MY MIND I LEARNED FROM YOUR PAPERS
NATURE DECAYED AROUND ME AND THE SUN BECAME HEATLESS RAIN AND SNOW POURED AROUND ME MIGHTY RIVERS WERE FROZEN THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WAS HARD AND CHILL AND BARE
AND FIXING MY FEET FIRMLY AS I ADVANCED PERPLEXED ME OCCUPIED AS I WAS BY THE EMOTIONS WHICH THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY HAD PRODUCED NIGHT WAS FAR ADVANCED WHEN I CAME TO THE HALFWAY RESTING PLACE AND SEATED MYSELF BESIDE THE FOUNTAIN
ON YOUR SOLEMN OATH TO QUIT EUROPE FOREVER AND EVERY OTHER PLACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AS SOON AS I SHALL DELIVER INTO YOUR HANDS A FEMALE WHO WILL ACCOMPANY YOU IN YOUR EXILE I SWEAR HE CRIED BY THE SUN
AND SHOULD I FEEL KINDNESS TOWARDS MY ENEMIES NO FROM THAT MOMENT I DECLARED EVERLASTING WAR AGAINST THE SPECIES AND MORE THAN ALL AGAINST HIM WHO HAD FORMED ME
AND TO SAVE THEM I RESOLVED TO DEDICATE MYSELF TO MY MOST ABHORRED TASK THE PROSPECT OF SUCH AN OCCUPATION MADE EVERY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF EXISTENCE PASS BEFORE ME LIKE A DREAM
WHY DID I LIVE WHY IN THAT INSTANT DID I NOT EXTINGUISH THE SPARK OF EXISTENCE WHICH YOU HAD SO WANTONLY BESTOWED I KNOW NOT
WHEN NIGHT CAME I QUITTED MY RETREAT AND WANDERED IN THE WOOD AND NOW NO LONGER RESTRAINED BY THE FEAR OF DISCOVERY I GAVE VENT TO MY ANGUISH IN FEARFUL HOWLINGS
AND THE SUFFERINGS I ENDURED INTENSE IT WAS LATE IN AUTUMN WHEN I QUITTED THE DISTRICT WHERE I HAD SO LONG RESIDED I TRAVELLED ONLY AT NIGHT FEARFUL OF ENCOUNTERING THE VISAGE OF A HUMAN BEING
THE DAY WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OF SPRING CHEERED EVEN ME BY THE LOVELINESS OF ITS SUNSHINE AND THE BALMINESS OF THE AIR I FELT EMOTIONS OF GENTLENESS AND PLEASURE THAT HAD LONG APPEARED DEAD
HERE I PAUSED NOT EXACTLY KNOWING WHAT PATH TO PURSUE WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES
INFORMATION FROM A SINGLE HUMAN BEING BUT I DID NOT DESPAIR FROM YOU ONLY COULD I HOPE FOR SUCCOUR ALTHOUGH TOWARDS YOU I FELT NO SENTIMENT BUT THAT OF HATRED
I COULD NO LONGER SUPPRESS THE RAGE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME I DO REFUSE IT I REPLIED AND NO TORTURE SHALL EVER EXTORT A CONSENT FROM ME YOU MAY RENDER ME THE MOST MISERABLE OF MEN BUT YOU SHALL NEVER MAKE ME BASE IN MY OWN EYES
I SHUDDERED WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF MY CONSENT BUT I FELT THAT THERE WAS SOME JUSTICE IN HIS ARGUMENT HIS TALE AND THE FEELINGS HE NOW EXPRESSED PROVED HIM TO BE A CREATURE OF FINE SENSATIONS
WHAT I ASK OF YOU IS REASONABLE AND MODERATE I DEMAND A CREATURE OF ANOTHER SEX BUT AS HIDEOUS AS MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION IS SMALL
PRESENTLY TWO COUNTRYMEN PASSED BY BUT PAUSING NEAR THE COTTAGE THEY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION USING VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS BUT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY SAID AS THEY SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY
AND WHY DO YOU AGAIN HARDEN YOURSELF TO MY COMPLAINTS I SWEAR TO YOU BY THE EARTH WHICH I INHABIT AND BY YOU THAT MADE ME THAT WITH THE COMPANION YOU BESTOW I WILL QUIT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AND DWELL AS IT MAY CHANCE
I DO NOT INTEND TO HURT YOU LISTEN TO ME
MY BELOVED AWAKE THE SLEEPER STIRRED A THRILL OF TERROR RAN THROUGH ME SHOULD SHE INDEED AWAKE AND SEE ME AND CURSE ME AND DENOUNCE THE MURDERER THUS
MY WIFE AND MY SISTER WILL NEVER RECOVER FROM THEIR HORROR I ENTREAT YOU NOT TO REASON WITH ME ANY MORE TAKE POSSESSION OF YOUR TENEMENT AND LET ME FLY FROM THIS PLACE FELIX TREMBLED VIOLENTLY AS HE SAID THIS
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FEELINGS OF REVENGE AND HATRED FILLED MY BOSOM AND I DID NOT STRIVE TO CONTROL THEM BUT ALLOWING MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THE STREAM I BENT MY MIND TOWARDS INJURY AND DEATH
OF PLEASURE BUT MY TOILS NOW DREW NEAR A CLOSE AND IN TWO MONTHS FROM THIS TIME I REACHED THE ENVIRONS OF GENEVA IT WAS EVENING WHEN I ARRIVED AND I RETIRED TO A HIDING PLACE AMONG THE FIELDS THAT SURROUND IT
AND HER LOVELY LIPS BUT PRESENTLY MY RAGE RETURNED I REMEMBERED THAT I WAS FOREVER DEPRIVED OF THE DELIGHTS THAT SUCH BEAUTIFUL CREATURES COULD BESTOW AND THAT SHE WHOSE RESEMBLANCE I CONTEMPLATED WOULD IN REGARDING ME
ACCORDINGLY I HID MYSELF IN SOME THICK UNDERWOOD DETERMINING TO DEVOTE THE ENSUING HOURS TO REFLECTION ON MY SITUATION THE PLEASANT SUNSHINE AND THE PURE AIR OF DAY RESTORED ME TO SOME DEGREE OF TRANQUILLITY
THIS DEATH WILL CARRY DESPAIR TO HIM AND A THOUSAND OTHER MISERIES SHALL TORMENT AND DESTROY HIM AS I FIXED MY EYES ON THE CHILD I SAW SOMETHING GLITTERING ON HIS BREAST I TOOK IT
UNFEELING HEARTLESS CREATOR YOU HAD ENDOWED ME WITH PERCEPTIONS AND PASSIONS AND THEN CAST ME ABROAD AN OBJECT FOR THE SCORN AND HORROR OF MANKIND BUT ON YOU ONLY
I SANK TO THE GROUND AND MY INJURER WITH INCREASED SWIFTNESS ESCAPED INTO THE WOOD THIS
SUDDENLY AS I GAZED ON HIM AN IDEA SEIZED ME THAT THIS LITTLE CREATURE WAS UNPREJUDICED AND HAD LIVED TOO SHORT A TIME TO HAVE IMBIBED A HORROR OF DEFORMITY
SPREAD HAVOC AND DESTRUCTION AROUND ME AND THEN TO HAVE SAT DOWN AND ENJOYED THE RUIN BUT THIS WAS A LUXURY OF SENSATION THAT COULD NOT ENDURE
AND I SHALL BECOME A THING OF WHOSE EXISTENCE EVERYONE WILL BE IGNORANT MY VICES ARE THE CHILDREN OF A FORCED SOLITUDE THAT I ABHOR AND MY VIRTUES WILL
IT WAS APPARENT THAT MY CONVERSATION HAD INTERESTED THE FATHER IN MY BEHALF AND I WAS A FOOL IN HAVING EXPOSED MY PERSON TO THE HORROR OF HIS CHILDREN I OUGHT TO HAVE FAMILIARIZED THE OLD DE LACEY TO ME AND BY DEGREES
I BECAME FATIGUED WITH EXCESS OF BODILY EXERTION AND SANK ON THE DAMP GRASS IN THE SICK IMPOTENCE OF DESPAIR THERE WAS NONE AMONG THE MYRIADS OF MEN
BE HERS THE PUNISHMENT THANKS TO THE LESSONS OF FELIX AND THE SANGUINARY LAWS OF MAN I HAD LEARNED NOW TO WORK MISCHIEF I BENT OVER HER
I HAD NO RIGHT TO WITHHOLD FROM HIM THE SMALL PORTION OF HAPPINESS WHICH WAS YET IN MY POWER TO BESTOW YOU SWEAR I SAID TO BE HARMLESS BUT HAVE YOU NOT
BUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE READY I SHALL APPEAR SAYING THIS HE SUDDENLY QUITTED ME FEARFUL PERHAPS OF ANY CHANGE IN MY SENTIMENTS I SAW HIM DESCEND THE MOUNTAIN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN THE FLIGHT OF AN EAGLE
THE STARS SHONE AT INTERVALS AS THE CLOUDS PASSED FROM OVER THEM THE DARK PINES ROSE BEFORE ME AND EVERY HERE AND THERE A BROKEN TREE LAY ON THE GROUND IT WAS A SCENE OF WONDERFUL SOLEMNITY
TO ONE EXPRESSIVE OF DISGUST AND AFFRIGHT CAN YOU WONDER THAT SUCH THOUGHTS TRANSPORTED ME WITH RAGE I ONLY WONDER THAT AT THAT MOMENT
PERSEVERE IN THIS EXILE YOU WILL RETURN AND AGAIN SEEK THEIR KINDNESS AND YOU WILL MEET WITH THEIR DETESTATION YOUR EVIL PASSIONS WILL BE RENEWED AND YOU WILL THEN HAVE A COMPANION TO AID YOU IN THE TASK OF DESTRUCTION
AND BY THE BLUE SKY OF HEAVEN AND BY THE FIRE OF LOVE THAT BURNS MY HEART THAT IF YOU GRANT MY PRAYER WHILE THEY EXIST YOU SHALL NEVER BEHOLD ME AGAIN DEPART TO YOUR HOME AND COMMENCE YOUR LABOURS
BUT I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW THE ETERNAL TWINKLING OF THE STARS WEIGHED UPON ME AND HOW I LISTENED TO EVERY BLAST OF WIND AS IF IT WERE A DULL UGLY SIROC ON ITS WAY TO CONSUME ME MORNING DAWNED BEFORE I ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE OF
AND QUICKLY LOST AMONG THE UNDULATIONS OF THE SEA OF ICE
LET ME FEEL GRATITUDE TOWARDS YOU FOR ONE BENEFIT LET ME SEE THAT I EXCITE THE SYMPATHY OF SOME EXISTING THING DO NOT DENY ME MY REQUEST I WAS MOVED
AND ALL WITHIN ME WAS TURNED TO GALL AND BITTERNESS
UGLY WRETCH YOU WISH TO EAT ME AND TEAR ME TO PIECES YOU ARE AN OGRE LET ME GO OR I WILL TELL MY PAPA BOY YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOUR FATHER AGAIN YOU MUST COME WITH ME HIDEOUS MONSTER LET ME GO
THE MORE DEEPLY DID I FEEL THE SPIRIT OF REVENGE ENKINDLED IN MY HEART SNOW FELL AND THE WATERS WERE HARDENED BUT I RESTED NOT
I CONTINUED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY IN MY HOVEL IN A STATE OF UTTER AND STUPID DESPAIR MY PROTECTORS HAD DEPARTED AND HAD BROKEN THE ONLY LINK THAT HELD ME TO THE WORLD
NECESSARILY ARISE WHEN I LIVE IN COMMUNION WITH AN EQUAL I SHALL FEEL THE AFFECTIONS OF A SENSITIVE BEING AND BECOME LINKED TO THE CHAIN OF EXISTENCE AND EVENTS FROM WHICH I AM NOW EXCLUDED
INFLAMED BY PAIN I VOWED ETERNAL HATRED AND VENGEANCE TO ALL MANKIND BUT THE AGONY OF MY WOUND OVERCAME ME MY PULSES PAUSED AND I FAINTED
WOULD SHE ASSUREDLY ACT IF HER DARKENED EYES OPENED AND SHE BEHELD ME THE THOUGHT WAS MADNESS
ALREADY SHOWN A DEGREE OF MALICE THAT SHOULD REASONABLY MAKE ME DISTRUST YOU MAY NOT EVEN THIS BE A FEINT THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR TRIUMPH BY AFFORDING A WIDER SCOPE FOR YOUR REVENGE HOW IS THIS
I WILL WORK AT YOUR DESTRUCTION NOR FINISH UNTIL I DESOLATE YOUR HEART SO THAT YOU SHALL CURSE THE HOUR OF YOUR BIRTH A FIENDISH RAGE ANIMATED HIM AS HE SAID THIS
I HAD NO MEANS OF EXTRACTING IT MY SUFFERINGS WERE AUGMENTED ALSO BY THE OPPRESSIVE SENSE OF THE INJUSTICE AND INGRATITUDE OF THEIR INFLICTION MY DAILY VOWS ROSE FOR REVENGE A DEEP AND DEADLY REVENGE
AND STIRRED STRANGE THOUGHTS WITHIN ME I WEPT BITTERLY AND CLASPING MY HANDS IN AGONY I EXCLAIMED OH STARS AND CLOUDS AND WINDS YE ARE ALL ABOUT TO MOCK ME
NO INCIDENT OCCURRED FROM WHICH MY RAGE AND MISERY COULD NOT EXTRACT ITS FOOD BUT A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAPPENED WHEN I ARRIVED ON THE CONFINES OF SWITZERLAND
THUS I RETURNED HOME AND ENTERING THE HOUSE PRESENTED MYSELF TO THE FAMILY MY HAGGARD AND WILD APPEARANCE AWOKE INTENSE ALARM BUT I ANSWERED NO QUESTION SCARCELY DID I SPEAK
I ENTERED A BARN WHICH HAD APPEARED TO ME TO BE EMPTY A WOMAN WAS SLEEPING ON SOME STRAW SHE WAS YOUNG NOT INDEED SO BEAUTIFUL AS HER WHOSE PORTRAIT I HELD
HE WILL PUNISH YOU YOU DARE NOT KEEP ME FRANKENSTEIN YOU BELONG THEN TO MY ENEMY TO HIM TOWARDS WHOM I HAVE SWORN ETERNAL REVENGE YOU SHALL BE MY FIRST VICTIM
REPLIED I TO FLY FROM THE HABITATIONS OF MAN TO DWELL IN THOSE WILDS WHERE THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD WILL BE YOUR ONLY COMPANIONS HOW CAN YOU WHO LONG FOR THE LOVE AND SYMPATHY OF MAN
I DO NOT DESTROY THE LAMB AND THE KID TO GLUT MY APPETITE ACORNS AND BERRIES AFFORD ME SUFFICIENT NOURISHMENT MY COMPANION WILL BE OF THE SAME NATURE AS MYSELF AND WILL BE CONTENT WITH THE SAME FARE WE SHALL MAKE OUR BED OF DRIED LEAVES
TO MEDITATE IN WHAT MANNER I SHOULD APPLY TO YOU I WAS OPPRESSED BY FATIGUE AND HUNGER AND FAR TOO UNHAPPY TO ENJOY THE GENTLE BREEZES OF EVENING OR THE PROSPECT OF THE SUN SETTING BEHIND THE STUPENDOUS MOUNTAINS OF JURA
REVIVE WITHIN ME HALF SURPRISED BY THE NOVELTY OF THESE SENSATIONS I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THEM AND FORGETTING MY SOLITUDE AND DEFORMITY DARED TO BE HAPPY
IF I CANNOT INSPIRE LOVE I WILL CAUSE FEAR AND CHIEFLY TOWARDS YOU MY ARCH ENEMY BECAUSE MY CREATOR DO I SWEAR INEXTINGUISHABLE HATRED HAVE A CARE
AND INSTEAD OF THREATENING I AM CONTENT TO REASON WITH YOU I AM MALICIOUS BECAUSE I AM MISERABLE AM I NOT SHUNNED AND HATED BY ALL MANKIND
TO HAVE DISCOVERED MYSELF TO THE REST OF HIS FAMILY WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR MY APPROACH
AND PLACED THE PORTRAIT SECURELY IN ONE OF THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS SHE MOVED AGAIN AND I FLED FOR SOME DAYS I HAUNTED THE SPOT WHERE THESE SCENES HAD TAKEN PLACE
AND I FOUND NO SHELTER OH EARTH HOW OFTEN DID I IMPRECATE CURSES ON THE CAUSE OF MY BEING
I CREPT FORTH FROM MY HIDING PLACE AND WENT IN SEARCH OF FOOD WHEN MY HUNGER WAS APPEASED I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE WELL KNOWN PATH THAT CONDUCTED TO THE COTTAGE ALL THERE WAS AT PEACE
AND AFTER HAVING DESTROYED EVERY VESTIGE OF CULTIVATION IN THE GARDEN I WAITED WITH FORCED IMPATIENCE UNTIL THE MOON HAD SUNK TO COMMENCE MY OPERATIONS AS THE NIGHT ADVANCED A FIERCE WIND
BUT THAT CANNOT BE THE HUMAN SENSES ARE INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS TO OUR UNION YET MINE SHALL NOT BE THE SUBMISSION OF ABJECT SLAVERY I WILL REVENGE MY INJURIES
I THOUGHT OF THE PROMISE OF VIRTUES WHICH HE HAD DISPLAYED ON THE OPENING OF HIS EXISTENCE AND THE SUBSEQUENT BLIGHT OF ALL KINDLY FEELING BY THE LOATHING AND SCORN WHICH HIS PROTECTORS HAD MANIFESTED TOWARDS HIM HIS POWER AND THREATS
THE SUN WILL SHINE ON US AS ON MAN AND WILL RIPEN OUR FOOD THE PICTURE I PRESENT TO YOU IS PEACEFUL AND HUMAN AND YOU MUST FEEL THAT YOU COULD DENY IT ONLY IN THE WANTONNESS OF POWER AND CRUELTY
FOR SURELY HE IS THE GREATEST OF MEN AND THE GRAND GORILLA WHO HAD THE STRENGTH OF SEVEN HORSES IN HIS HAIRY ARMS ROLLED A GREAT ROCK UP TO THE HEAD OF THE TABLE AND SAID THIS STONE
FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF THEM SINCE I SHOULD NOT HAVE ATTACHED MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THAT ALIBI MYSELF BIGGS'S BOY AS I HAVE SAID CAME ROUND THE CORNER HE WAS EVIDENTLY IN A GREAT HURRY WHEN HE FIRST DAWNED UPON THE VISION
I WILL ATTEND TO THE HOOF AND I WILL DIRECT YOUR MAN HOW TO APPLY THE LINIMENT WHICH I WILL GIVE HIM THE NEXT DAY I HAD MY FEET THOROUGHLY CLEANSED AND STUFFED WITH TOW SOAKED IN SOME STRONG LOTION
BUT BIGGS'S BOYS ARE NOT AS A RULE TOUCHY HE CAME TO A DEAD STOP A YARD FROM OUR STEP
NINE O WHAT I CRIED STARTING UP NINE O'CLOCK SHE REPLIED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE I THOUGHT YOU WAS A OVERSLEEPING YOURSELVES I WOKE HARRIS AND TOLD HIM HE SAID
SAID HIS MASTER YES SIR I WILL THE BRICKLAYER CAME AND PULLED UP A GREAT MANY BRICKS BUT FOUND NOTHING AMISS SO HE PUT DOWN SOME LIME AND CHARGED THE MASTER FIVE SHILLINGS
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GET UP AT SIX SO I DID I ANSWERED
AND AFTER ROBERT HAD WRAPPED UP MY KNEES IN WET CLOTHS HE TIED UP MY FOOT IN A BRAN POULTICE TO DRAW OUT THE HEAT AND CLEANSE IT BEFORE THE HORSE DOCTOR SAW IT IN THE MORNING AND I MANAGED TO GET MYSELF DOWN ON THE STRAW
THEY ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD GO WITH DOCTOR DOLITTLE AND BE PUT ON SHOW IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN BUT HE SHOOK BOTH HIS HEADS HARD AND SAID CERTAINLY NOT
BUT FOR ALL THAT SHE BEGGED ME TO GO AND MEET HIM BUT WHAT MUST WE DO THERE'S THE HORSE TO GET HOME AS WELL AS THE BODY AND THAT WILL BE NO EASY MATTER
I'M AFRAID IT HAS BEEN THE OLD THING OVER AGAIN POOR SUSAN SHE LOOKED AWFULLY PALE WHEN SHE CAME TO MY HOUSE TO ASK IF HE HAD NOT COME HOME SHE MADE BELIEVE SHE WAS NOT A BIT ANXIOUS
UNUSED HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN UP STUFFING HIMSELF WITH EGGS AND BACON IRRITATING THE DOG OR FLIRTING WITH THE SLAVEY INSTEAD OF SPRAWLING THERE SUNK IN SOUL CLOGGING OBLIVION IT WAS A TERRIBLE THOUGHT
TILL MY FEET WERE WELL AGAIN WITH THIS TREATMENT I SOON REGAINED MY SPIRITS BUT MISTER BARRY WAS SO MUCH DISGUSTED AT BEING TWICE DECEIVED BY HIS GROOMS THAT HE DETERMINED TO GIVE UP KEEPING A HORSE
HARRIS AND I APPEARED TO BE STRUCK BY IT AT THE SAME INSTANT WE DETERMINED TO SAVE HIM AND IN THIS NOBLE RESOLVE OUR OWN DISPUTE WAS FORGOTTEN WE FLEW ACROSS AND SLUNG THE CLOTHES OFF HIM
OR THE TEN A M EXPRESS FOR THE ISLE OF WIGHT OR SOMEWHERE IN THAT DIRECTION AND WE SHOULD ALL KNOW WHEN WE GOT THERE WE SLIPPED HALF A CROWN INTO HIS HAND
WELL NO SIR I'M AFRAID IT'S SETTLED DOWN FOR THE DAY HE REPLIES SHAKING HIS HEAD STUPID OLD FOOL WE MUTTER WHAT'S HE KNOW ABOUT IT AND IF HIS PORTENT PROVES CORRECT
AND MY SHOE WAS PICKED UP AMONG THE STONES SO THAT THE CASE WAS QUITE PLAIN TO THEM AND I WAS CLEARED OF ALL BLAME EVERYBODY PITIED SUSAN SHE WAS NEARLY OUT OF HER MIND
SO SHE WENT ON TILL AFTER HE WAS BURIED AND THEN AS SHE HAD NO HOME OR RELATIONS
THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS STARTED OUT TO GO BACK TO THE SEASHORE
AS THE BEEF COULD WAIT GEORGE GOT HOLD OF THE PAPER AND READ US OUT THE BOATING FATALITIES
WITH GREAT PAIN I AM SURE HE WAS SORRY FOR ME FOR HE OFTEN PATTED AND ENCOURAGED ME TALKING TO ME IN A PLEASANT VOICE AT LAST I REACHED MY OWN BOX AND HAD SOME CORN
NOBODY AT WATERLOO EVER DOES KNOW WHERE A TRAIN IS GOING TO START FROM OR WHERE A TRAIN WHEN IT DOES START IS GOING TO OR ANYTHING ABOUT IT THE PORTER WHO TOOK OUR THINGS THOUGHT IT WOULD GO FROM NUMBER TWO PLATFORM
I THINK THE DRAIN DOES SOMETIMES SEND BACK A SMELL THERE MAY BE SOMETHING WRONG SIR
BUT ON CATCHING SIGHT OF HARRIS AND ME AND MONTMORENCY AND THE THINGS HE EASED UP AND STARED HARRIS AND I FROWNED AT HIM THIS MIGHT HAVE WOUNDED A MORE SENSITIVE NATURE
BUT SHE KNEW AS WELL AS I DID WHAT WAS GOING ON AND STOOD AS STILL AS A STONE I NOTICED THAT BECAUSE IF SHE HAD A FAULT IT WAS THAT SHE WAS IMPATIENT IN STANDING
WELL SIR HE SAID TOUCHING HIS CAP I'LL DO SO IF YOU PLEASE SIR BUT IT IS RATHER DANGEROUS SIR THROWING DOWN WATER IN A HORSE'S BOX THEY ARE VERY APT TO TAKE COLD SIR I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO HIM AN INJURY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THIS HORSE HE GOES VERY FUMBLE FOOTED I AM SOMETIMES AFRAID HE WILL STUMBLE YES SIR SAID ALFRED I HAVE NOTICED THE SAME MYSELF WHEN I HAVE EXERCISED HIM
WHEN THE PACKING WAS FINISHED AND EVERYTHING WAS READY TO START THE MONKEYS GAVE A GRAND PARTY FOR THE DOCTOR AND ALL THE ANIMALS OF THE JUNGLE CAME AND THEY HAD PINEAPPLES AND MANGOES AND HONEY
WE CALMED THEM WITH AN UMBRELLA AND SAT DOWN TO CHOPS AND COLD BEEF HARRIS SAID THE GREAT THING IS TO MAKE A GOOD BREAKFAST AND HE STARTED WITH A COUPLE OF CHOPS SAYING THAT HE WOULD TAKE THESE WHILE THEY WERE HOT
AND ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT AND DRINK AFTER THEY HAD ALL FINISHED EATING THE DOCTOR GOT UP AND SAID MY FRIENDS I AM NOT CLEVER AT SPEAKING LONG WORDS AFTER DINNER LIKE SOME MEN
CONSIDERED HIMSELF VERY HANDSOME HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ABOUT HIS HAIR WHISKERS AND NECKTIE BEFORE A LITTLE LOOKING GLASS IN THE HARNESS ROOM WHEN HIS MASTER WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IT WAS ALWAYS YES SIR
WHILE THE STRONG VAPORS THAT ROSE MADE MY EYES SMART AND INFLAME AND I DID NOT FEEL THE SAME APPETITE FOR MY FOOD ONE DAY HIS MASTER CAME IN AND SAID ALFRED THE STABLE SMELLS RATHER STRONG
HOW IT ENDED IT MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY MIDNIGHT WHEN I HEARD AT A GREAT DISTANCE THE SOUND OF A HORSE'S FEET SOMETIMES THE SOUND DIED AWAY THEN IT GREW CLEARER AGAIN
WE TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT SHAVING THAT MORNING AS WE WEREN'T GOING TO UNPACK THAT BAG AGAIN FOR HIM NOR FOR ANYONE LIKE HIM HE SAID DON'T BE ABSURD HOW CAN I GO INTO THE CITY LIKE THIS
IN FACT HE DID A GREAT DEAL OF STROKING AND PATTING
AND WHEN AT LAST IT WAS HEALED THEY PUT A BLISTERING FLUID OVER THE FRONT OF BOTH KNEES TO BRING ALL THE HAIR OFF THEY HAD SOME REASON FOR THIS AND I SUPPOSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AS SMITH'S DEATH HAD BEEN SO SUDDEN
MUCH HEAT UNTIL IT WAS STOPPED BY THE PEG AND COULDN'T GO ANY FURTHER IT TRIED ITS BEST
IT WAS PROMPTLY CONCLUDED BY OUR STREET THAT BIGGS'S BOY FOR THAT PERIOD WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT AND HAD HE NOT BEEN ABLE
CAN'T THE OTHER HEAD TALK AS WELL OH YES SAID THE PUSHMI PULLYU BUT I KEEP THE OTHER MOUTH FOR EATING MOSTLY IN THAT WAY I CAN TALK WHILE I AM EATING WITHOUT BEING RUDE OUR PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY POLITE
THE FARRIER ORDERED ALL THE LITTER TO BE TAKEN OUT OF MY BOX DAY BY DAY AND THE FLOOR KEPT VERY CLEAN THEN I WAS TO HAVE BRAN MASHES A LITTLE GREEN FOOD AND NOT SO MUCH CORN
NOONDAY SPLENDOR NORMAL CHARACTERISTICS NOTABLE CIRCUMSTANCE NOTEWORTHY FRIENDSHIP NOTICEABLY BEGRIMED
AND AFTER THEY HAD GONE A GOOD MANY MILES ONE OF THEM FOUND PECULIAR FOOTPRINTS NEAR THE EDGE OF A RIVER AND THEY KNEW THAT A PUSHMI PULLYU MUST BE VERY NEAR THAT SPOT THEN
IN ALL WEATHERS FOR PUSHMI PULLYUS NOT A SINGLE ONE HAD EVER BEEN CAUGHT EVEN THEN YEARS AGO HE WAS THE ONLY ANIMAL IN THE WORLD WITH TWO HEADS WELL
AND PEOPLE WOULD PASS THE HOUSE GOING OFF IN WAGONETTES AND COACHES AS JOLLY AND MERRY AS COULD BE THE SUN SHINING OUT AND NOT A CLOUD TO BE SEEN AH WE SAID AS WE STOOD LOOKING OUT AT THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW WON'T THEY COME HOME SOAKED
IT WOULD COMMENCE TO RAIN HARD AND A BITTERLY COLD WIND WOULD SPRING UP AND BOTH WOULD KEEP ON STEADILY FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND WE WOULD COME HOME WITH COLDS AND RHEUMATISM ALL OVER US AND GO TO BED
BUT I SHOULD NEVER LOSE THE BLEMISH I BELIEVE THEY DID THE BEST TO MAKE A GOOD CURE BUT IT WAS A LONG AND PAINFUL ONE PROUD FLESH AS THEY CALLED IT CAME UP IN MY KNEES AND WAS BURNED OUT WITH CAUSTIC
OUTSTRETCHING SYMPATHIES OUTWARD POMP OUTWORN CREED OVERBEARING STYLE OVERESTIMATED IMPORTANCE
AND TO HIRE WHEN HE WANTED ONE I WAS THEREFORE KEPT TILL MY FEET WERE QUITE SOUND
AND EVEN TO THIS DAY IN THE HEART OF THE JUNGLE THAT STONE STILL IS THERE AND MONKEY MOTHERS PASSING THROUGH THE FOREST WITH THEIR FAMILIES STILL POINT DOWN AT IT FROM THE BRANCHES
AND PACKING OURSELVES AND OUR BELONGINGS INTO IT AND SHOOTING OUT A COUPLE OF MONTMORENCY'S FRIENDS WHO HAD EVIDENTLY SWORN NEVER TO FORSAKE HIM WE DROVE AWAY AMIDST THE CHEERS OF THE CROWD BIGGS'S BOY SHYING A CARROT AFTER US FOR LUCK
WHAT HE SHRIEKED JUMPING OUT OF BED INTO THE BATH WHO THE THUNDER PUT THIS THING HERE WE TOLD HIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN A FOOL NOT TO SEE THE BATH WE FINISHED DRESSING
IS ABOUT THE MOST AGGRAVATING IT FORECASTS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE AND PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO DAY I REMEMBER A HOLIDAY OF MINE BEING COMPLETELY RUINED ONE LATE AUTUMN
OMINOUS RUMORS OMNIPOTENT DECREE OMNISCIENT AFFIRMATION ONCOMING HORDE
THEY EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SHUT UP IN A MENAGERIE BUT WOULD JUST BE LOOKED AT THEY TOLD HIM THAT THE DOCTOR WAS A VERY KIND MAN BUT HADN'T ANY MONEY AND PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO SEE A TWO HEADED ANIMAL AND THE DOCTOR WOULD GET RICH
AND SELECTING A STRAW TO CHEW FIXED US WITH HIS EYE HE EVIDENTLY MEANT TO SEE THIS THING OUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE GROCER'S BOY PASSED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET BIGGS'S BOY HAILED HIM
WITHOUT OUR HAVING THE MISERY OF KNOWING ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND THE PROPHET WE LIKE IS THE OLD MAN WHO ON THE PARTICULARLY GLOOMY LOOKING MORNING OF SOME DAY WHEN WE PARTICULARLY WANT IT TO BE FINE LOOKS ROUND THE HORIZON WITH A PARTICULARLY KNOWING EYE
AND A COUPLE OF POUNDS OF GRAPES IN ANOTHER BAG AND A JAPANESE PAPER UMBRELLA AND A FRYING PAN WHICH BEING TOO LONG TO PACK WE HAD WRAPPED ROUND WITH BROWN PAPER IT DID LOOK A LOT
WHAT'S ELY GOT TO DO WITH IT AND IF YOU TAP IT
BEING WASTED IN MERE BRUTISH SLEEP THERE WAS GEORGE THROWING AWAY IN HIDEOUS SLOTH THE INESTIMABLE GIFT OF TIME HIS VALUABLE LIFE EVERY SECOND OF WHICH HE WOULD HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR HEREAFTER PASSING AWAY FROM HIM
WHEN THE DOCTOR STOPPED SPEAKING AND SAT DOWN ALL THE MONKEYS CLAPPED THEIR HANDS A LONG TIME AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER LET IT BE REMEMBERED ALWAYS AMONG OUR PEOPLE THAT HE SAT AND ATE WITH US HERE UNDER THE TREES
ORGANIC ASSIMILATION ORIENTAL SPICERY ORIGINALLY PROMULGATED OSCILLATORY MOVEMENT OSTENSIBLE OCCUPATION
WE COME BACK FEELING STILL MORE ANGRY AGAINST HIM AND WITH A VAGUE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE HAS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT IT WAS TOO BRIGHT AND SUNNY ON THIS ESPECIAL MORNING FOR GEORGE'S BLOOD CURDLING READINGS ABOUT
AND IT JUMPED UP AND POINTED TO VERY DRY THE BOOTS STOPPED AS HE WAS PASSING AND SAID HE EXPECTED IT MEANT TO MORROW I FANCIED THAT MAYBE IT WAS THINKING OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST BUT BOOTS SAID NO HE THOUGHT NOT
AND THAT I WAS PROBABLY THE CORPSE'S BROTHER AT LAST AN EMPTY CAB TURNED UP IT IS A STREET WHERE AS A RULE AND WHEN THEY ARE NOT WANTED EMPTY CABS PASS AT THE RATE OF THREE A MINUTE AND HANG ABOUT AND GET IN YOUR WAY
THE PUSHMI PULLYU HEARD THEM COMING AND HE TRIED HARD TO BREAK THROUGH THE RING OF MONKEYS BUT HE COULDN'T DO IT WHEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS NO USE TRYING TO ESCAPE HE SAT DOWN AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT THEY WANTED
BIGGS'S BOY WAS THE FIRST TO COME ROUND BIGGS IS OUR GREENGROCER AND HIS CHIEF TALENT LIES IN SECURING THE SERVICES
OR GROOMING ME THOROUGHLY HE THOUGHT NO MORE OF THAT THAN IF I HAD BEEN A COW HE LEFT MY BIT RUSTY MY SADDLE DAMP AND MY CRUPPER STIFF ALFRED SMIRK
SAID THE MAN RIGHT IT IS WE ANSWERED AND WITH HARRIS AT THE SCULLS AND I AT THE TILLER LINES AND MONTMORENCY UNHAPPY AND DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS IN THE PROW
EXCUSE ME SURELY YOU ARE RELATED TO THE DEER FAMILY ARE YOU NOT YES

NOTORIOUSLY PROFLIGATE NOVEL
AND A LOVELY NIGHT AFTER IT THE NEXT MORNING WE WOULD READ THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A WARM FINE TO SET FAIR DAY MUCH HEAT AND WE WOULD DRESS OURSELVES IN FLIMSY THINGS
AND THE MONKEYS TELL ME THAT I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL DO BUT YOU MUST PROMISE ME THAT IF I DO NOT LIKE IT IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN YOU WILL SEND ME BACK WHY CERTAINLY OF COURSE OF COURSE SAID THE DOCTOR
AND COULD PAY FOR THE BOAT HE HAD BORROWED TO COME TO AFRICA IN BUT HE ANSWERED NO YOU KNOW HOW SHY I AM I HATE BEING STARED AT AND HE ALMOST BEGAN TO CRY
TOOK UP AN INDEPENDENT POSITION ON THE CURB THEY AIN'T A GOING TO STARVE ARE THEY SAID THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE BOOT SHOP AH YOU'D WANT TO TAKE A THING OR TWO WITH YOU RETORTED THE BLUE POSTS
AND WE CHUCKLED TO THINK HOW WET THEY WERE GOING TO GET AND CAME BACK AND STIRRED THE FIRE AND GOT OUR BOOKS AND ARRANGED OUR SPECIMENS OF SEAWEED AND COCKLE SHELLS BY TWELVE O'CLOCK WITH THE SUN POURING INTO THE ROOM THE HEAT BECAME QUITE OPPRESSIVE

BUT I'LL DO IT IF YOU PLEASE SIR WELL SAID HIS MASTER I SHOULD NOT LIKE HIM TO TAKE COLD BUT I DON'T LIKE THE SMELL OF THIS STABLE DO YOU THINK THE DRAINS ARE ALL RIGHT WELL SIR NOW YOU MENTION IT
THE GROCER'S BOY CAME ACROSS AND TOOK UP A POSITION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STEP THEN THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN FROM THE BOOT SHOP STOPPED AND JOINED BIGGS'S BOY WHILE THE EMPTY CAN SUPERINTENDENT FROM THE BLUE POSTS
AND SAYS OH NO SIR
I MADE TWO SUCH SERIOUS STUMBLES THAT AS HE CAME DOWN LANSDOWN INTO THE CITY HE STOPPED AT THE FARRIER'S AND ASKED HIM TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH ME
AND NEARER THE ROAD TO EARLSHALL LED THROUGH WOODS THAT BELONGED TO THE EARL THE SOUND CAME IN THAT DIRECTION AND I HOPED IT MIGHT BE SOME ONE COMING IN SEARCH OF US AS THE SOUND CAME NEARER AND NEARER
THERE WAS ONE HANGING UP IN A HOTEL AT OXFORD AT WHICH I WAS STAYING LAST SPRING AND WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS POINTING TO SET FAIR IT WAS SIMPLY POURING WITH RAIN OUTSIDE AND HAD BEEN ALL DAY AND I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE MATTERS OUT
NOW THE FACT WAS THAT HE HARDLY EVER DID EXERCISE ME AND WHEN THE MASTER WAS BUSY I OFTEN STOOD FOR DAYS TOGETHER WITHOUT STRETCHING MY LEGS AT ALL AND YET BEING FED JUST AS HIGH AS IF I WERE AT HARD WORK
HE ALWAYS BRUSHED MY MANE AND TAIL WITH WATER AND MY HOOFS WITH OIL BEFORE HE BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR TO MAKE ME LOOK SMART
NERVELESS HAND NERVOUS SOLICITUDE NETTLED OPPONENT NEUTRAL EYE NEW PERPLEXITIES
REALLY WANT TO GO ABROAD YES I'LL GO SAID THE PUSHMI PULLYU WHO SAW AT ONCE FROM THE DOCTOR'S FACE THAT HE WAS A MAN TO BE TRUSTED YOU HAVE BEEN SO KIND TO THE ANIMALS HERE
HE SNEAKED THE CIGARETTE THAT I HAD CAREFULLY ROLLED UP FOR MYSELF AND WENT THEN HARRIS AND I HAVING FINISHED UP THE FEW THINGS LEFT ON THE TABLE
THIS DOCTOR SAID CHEE CHEE IS THE PUSHMI PULLYU THE RAREST ANIMAL OF THE AFRICAN JUNGLES THE ONLY TWO HEADED BEAST IN THE WORLD TAKE HIM HOME WITH YOU
OSTENTATIOUS DISPLAY OUTLANDISH FASHION OUTRAGEOUSLY VEHEMENT OUTSPOKEN ENCOURAGEMENT OUTSTANDING FEATURE
BOOTS SAID IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A PROLONGED SPELL OF GRAND WEATHER SOME TIME AND READ OUT A POEM WHICH WAS PRINTED OVER THE TOP OF THE ORACLE ABOUT LONG FORETOLD LONG LAST
OVERFLOWING SYMPATHY OVERHANGING DARKNESS OVERMASTERING POTENCY OVERPOWERING ARGUMENT
WHO WAS PACKING THE TRUNK SAID COME IN AND CHEE CHEE VERY PROUDLY TOOK THE ANIMAL INSIDE AND SHOWED HIM TO THE DOCTOR WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT ASKED JOHN DOLITTLE GAZING AT THE STRANGE CREATURE
WITHOUT BREAKING ITSELF IT EVIDENTLY WANTED TO GO ON AND PROGNOSTICATE DROUGHT AND WATER FAMINE AND SUNSTROKE AND SIMOOMS AND SUCH THINGS BUT THE PEG PREVENTED IT
I WAS ALMOST SURE I COULD DISTINGUISH GINGER'S STEP
AND YOUR FORTUNE'S MADE PEOPLE WILL PAY ANY MONEY TO SEE HIM BUT I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY SAID THE DOCTOR YES YOU DO SAID DAB DAB THE DUCK
THE TENTH CHAPTER THE RAREST ANIMAL OF ALL PUSHMI PULLYUS ARE NOW EXTINCT THAT MEANS THERE AREN'T ANY MORE
TAKE THE FUNNY LOOKING THING ALONG DO WELL PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY MURMURED THE DOCTOR IT CERTAINLY WOULD MAKE A NICE NEW KIND OF PET BUT DOES THE ER
BUT YOU COULD NOT DO THIS WITH THE PUSHMI PULLYU BECAUSE NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU CAME TOWARDS HIM HE WAS ALWAYS FACING YOU AND BESIDES ONLY ONE HALF OF HIM SLEPT AT A TIME THE OTHER HEAD WAS ALWAYS AWAKE
THIS OFTEN DISORDERED MY HEALTH AND MADE ME SOMETIMES HEAVY AND DULL BUT MORE OFTEN RESTLESS AND FEVERISH HE NEVER EVEN GAVE ME A MEAL OF GREEN FOOD OR A BRAN MASH WHICH WOULD HAVE COOLED ME
HE SAID HE WOULD COME WITH THEM AND SEE WHAT KIND OF A MAN THE DOCTOR WAS FIRST SO THE MONKEYS TRAVELED BACK WITH THE PUSHMI PULLYU AND WHEN THEY CAME TO WHERE THE DOCTOR'S LITTLE HOUSE OF GRASS WAS THEY KNOCKED ON THE DOOR THE DUCK
THEY SOON SAW MY CUT KNEES WHY THE HORSE HAS BEEN DOWN AND THROWN HIM
TO THE ABYSSINIAN GAZELLES AND THE ASIATIC CHAMOIS ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE MY FATHER'S GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS THE LAST OF THE UNICORNS MOST INTERESTING MURMURED THE DOCTOR
THE LANDLADY WOULD COME IN TO ASK IF WE WEREN'T GOING OUT AS IT SEEMED SUCH A LOVELY DAY NO NO WE REPLIED WITH A KNOWING CHUCKLE NOT WE WE DON'T MEAN TO GET WET NO NO AND WHEN THE AFTERNOON WAS NEARLY GONE AND STILL THERE WAS NO SIGN OF RAIN
HIS FEET ARE VERY TENDER IT IS FORTUNATE THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN DOWN I WONDER YOUR GROOM HAS NOT SEEN TO IT BEFORE THIS IS THE SORT OF THING WE FIND IN FOUL STABLES WHERE THE LITTER IS NEVER PROPERLY CLEANED OUT IF YOU WILL SEND HIM HERE TO MORROW
WHEN HE CALLED THERE FOR ORDERS THE MORNING AFTER THE CRIME ASSISTED BY NO TWENTY ONE WHO HAPPENED TO BE ON THE STEP AT THE TIME TO PROVE A COMPLETE ALIBI IT WOULD HAVE GONE HARD WITH HIM I DIDN'T KNOW BIGGS'S BOY AT THAT TIME BUT
AND NOBODY KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF IT OUR BOAT WAS WAITING FOR US AT KINGSTON JUST BELOW BRIDGE AND TO IT WE WENDED OUR WAY AND ROUND IT WE STORED OUR LUGGAGE AND INTO IT WE STEPPED ARE YOU ALL RIGHT SIR
NOMINAL ALLEGIANCE NONCHALANT MANNER NON COMMITTAL WAY NONDESCRIPT GARB NONSENSE RHYMES
AND I HAVE JUST EATEN MANY FRUITS AND MUCH HONEY BUT I WISH TO TELL YOU THAT I AM VERY SAD AT LEAVING YOUR BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY BECAUSE I HAVE THINGS TO DO IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN I MUST GO
BUT A HEAD AT EACH END AND SHARP HORNS ON EACH HEAD THEY WERE VERY SHY AND TERRIBLY HARD TO CATCH THE BLACK MEN GET MOST OF THEIR ANIMALS BY SNEAKING UP BEHIND THEM WHILE THEY ARE NOT LOOKING
USED TO MAKE ME FEEL ILL AND UNCOMFORTABLE ONE DAY MY FEET WERE SO TENDER
THE MAN TOOK UP MY FEET ONE BY ONE AND EXAMINED THEM THEN STANDING UP AND DUSTING HIS HANDS ONE AGAINST THE OTHER HE SAID YOUR HORSE HAS GOT THE THRUSH AND BADLY TOO
NICE DISCRIMINATION NIGGARDLY ALLOWANCE NIGHTMARE FANTASY NIMBLE FACULTY NOBLE CONDESCENSION
NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW ON THIS LINE WE SAID WHAT YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU'RE GOING YOU KNOW THE WAY YOU SLIP OFF QUIETLY AND GO TO KINGSTON WELL I DON'T KNOW GENTS REPLIED THE NOBLE FELLOW
OR ELSE THE WINDSOR LOOP BUT THEY WERE SURE IT WASN'T THE KINGSTON TRAIN THOUGH WHY THEY WERE SURE IT WASN'T THEY COULDN'T SAY THEN OUR PORTER SAID HE THOUGHT THAT MUST BE IT ON THE HIGH LEVEL PLATFORM SAID HE THOUGHT HE KNEW THE TRAIN
A HUMBUG MY MASTER WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY SUITED BUT IN A FEW DAYS
OH DO BE SENSIBLE CRIED DAB DAB WHERE WOULD YOU GET ALL THE WOOD AND THE NAILS TO MAKE ONE WITH AND BESIDES WHAT ARE WE GOING TO LIVE ON WE SHALL BE POORER THAN EVER WHEN WE GET BACK CHEE CHEE'S PERFECTLY RIGHT
SICK WITH APPREHENSION WAS USHERED INTO AN AIRLESS ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS CELEBRATED PERSON AFTER THAT ONE AND THE KIND WORDS THEY SAID ABOUT MY BOOK MADE ME EXCESSIVELY UNCOMFORTABLE
I COULD NOT THINK OF ANY RETORT TO THIS SO I ASKED IF MISSUS STRICKLAND HAD CHILDREN YES SHE HAS A BOY AND A GIRL THEY'RE BOTH AT SCHOOL THE SUBJECT WAS EXHAUSTED AND WE BEGAN TO TALK OF OTHER THINGS
WHEN AT LAST WE WERE ALL ASSEMBLED WAITING FOR DINNER TO BE ANNOUNCED I REFLECTED WHILE I CHATTED WITH THE WOMAN I HAD BEEN ASKED TO TAKE IN THAT CIVILISED MAN PRACTISES A STRANGE INGENUITY
DID YOU THINK THE FOOD WAS GOOD I TOLD HER THAT IF SHE WANTED WRITERS SHE MUST FEED THEM WELL ADMIRABLE ADVICE I ANSWERED BUT WHY DOES SHE WANT THEM MISS WATERFORD SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS SHE FINDS THEM AMUSING
WHEN WE HAD DONE DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF THE LATEST BOOK IT WAS NATURAL TO WONDER HOW MANY COPIES HAD BEEN SOLD WHAT ADVANCE THE AUTHOR HAD RECEIVED AND HOW MUCH HE WAS LIKELY TO MAKE OUT OF IT
BUT THERE WAS NO GENERAL CONVERSATION EACH ONE TALKED TO HIS NEIGHBOUR TO HIS NEIGHBOUR ON THE RIGHT DURING THE SOUP FISH AND ENTREE TO HIS NEIGHBOUR ON THE LEFT DURING THE ROAST SWEET AND SAVOURY
MISSUS STRICKLAND HAD THE GIFT OF SYMPATHY IT IS A CHARMING FACULTY BUT ONE OFTEN ABUSED BY THOSE WHO ARE CONSCIOUS OF ITS POSSESSION FOR THERE IS SOMETHING GHOULISH IN THE AVIDITY WITH WHICH THEY WILL POUNCE UPON THE MISFORTUNE OF THEIR FRIENDS
WITH JUST SUCH SCORN AND THEY FORESEE THAT THESE BRAVE TORCH BEARERS WILL PRESENTLY YIELD THEIR PLACE ALSO THERE IS NO LAST WORD
IT WAS BECAUSE THE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THAT I HAD BEEN INVITED THE RESPECTABILITY OF THE PARTY WAS PORTENTOUS THE WOMEN WERE TOO NICE TO BE WELL DRESSED AND TOO SURE OF THEIR POSITION TO BE AMUSING
THE DINING ROOM WAS INCONVENIENTLY CROWDED THERE WAS A K C AND HIS WIFE A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND HIS WIFE MISSUS STRICKLAND'S SISTER AND HER HUSBAND COLONEL MAC ANDREW AND THE WIFE OF A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
STRICKLAND GAVE THE POLITE LITTLE LAUGH WITH WHICH PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE A FACETIOUSNESS IN WHICH THEY SEE NOTHING FUNNY BUT DID NOT SPEAK NEW ARRIVALS CLAIMED MY HOST'S ATTENTION AND I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SEE THAT MISSUS STRICKLAND WAS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER AND YOU FELT SURE THAT SHE WAS AN ADMIRABLE MOTHER THERE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE DRAWING ROOM OF HER SON AND DAUGHTER THE SON HIS NAME WAS ROBERT
THE DINING ROOM WAS IN THE GOOD TASTE OF THE PERIOD IT WAS VERY SEVERE
IF YOU WILL COME I SHALL BE UNCOMMONLY GRATEFUL AND YOU AND I CAN HAVE A LITTLE CHAT BY OURSELVES IT WAS ONLY NEIGHBOURLY TO ACCEPT WHEN MISSUS STRICKLAND INTRODUCED ME TO HER HUSBAND HE GAVE ME A RATHER INDIFFERENT HAND TO SHAKE
I LIVED NEAR VICTORIA STATION AND I RECALL LONG EXCURSIONS BY BUS TO THE HOSPITABLE HOUSES OF THE LITERARY IN MY TIMIDITY I WANDERED UP AND DOWN THE STREET WHILE I SCREWED UP MY COURAGE TO RING THE BELL AND THEN
IN POINT OF FACT HE WAS BROAD AND HEAVY WITH LARGE HANDS AND FEET AND HE WORE HIS EVENING CLOTHES CLUMSILY HE GAVE YOU SOMEWHAT THE IDEA OF A COACHMAN DRESSED UP FOR THE OCCASION HE WAS A MAN OF FORTY
AND THE EFFECT WAS UNGAINLY HE WAS CLEAN SHAVEN AND HIS LARGE FACE LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLY NAKED HIS HAIR WAS REDDISH CUT VERY SHORT AND HIS EYES WERE SMALL BLUE OR GREY HE LOOKED COMMONPLACE
THE EPIGRAM NOT YET A MECHANICAL APPLIANCE BY WHICH THE DULL MAY ACHIEVE A SEMBLANCE OF WIT GAVE SPRIGHTLINESS TO THE SMALL TALK OF THE URBANE IT IS SAD THAT I CAN REMEMBER NOTHING OF ALL THIS SCINTILLATION
OR TO ANOTHER WHO PUSHED A BOOK FOR ALL IT WAS WORTH SOME ADVERTISED BADLY AND SOME WELL SOME WERE MODERN AND SOME WERE OLD FASHIONED THEN WE WOULD TALK OF AGENTS AND THE OFFERS THEY HAD OBTAINED FOR US
ROSE WATERFORD CAST DOWN HER EYES DEMURELY TO GIVE GREATER EFFECT TO HER REPLY SHE GIVES LUNCHEON PARTIES
SHE WANTS TO BE IN THE MOVEMENT I FANCY SHE'S RATHER SIMPLE POOR DEAR AND SHE THINKS WE'RE ALL WONDERFUL AFTER ALL IT PLEASES HER TO ASK US TO LUNCHEON AND IT DOESN'T HURT US I LIKE HER FOR IT
THE MORE OBVIOUS FORMS OF PRETENTIOUSNESS
SHE MANAGED HER SURROUNDINGS WITH ELEGANCE HER FLAT WAS ALWAYS NEAT AND CHEERFUL GAY WITH FLOWERS AND THE CHINTZES IN THE DRAWING ROOM NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR SEVERE DESIGN WERE BRIGHT AND PRETTY THE MEALS IN THE ARTISTIC LITTLE DINING ROOM WERE PLEASANT
THESE A MAN CAN DO WITHOUT HE HAD NO ECCENTRICITY EVEN
MISSUS STRICKLAND USED HER ADVANTAGE WITH TACT YOU FELT THAT YOU OBLIGED HER BY ACCEPTING HER SYMPATHY WHEN IN THE ENTHUSIASM OF MY YOUTH I REMARKED ON THIS TO ROSE WATERFORD SHE SAID
WE TALKED ABOUT A HUNDRED THINGS MISS WATERFORD TORN BETWEEN THE AESTHETICISM OF HER EARLY YOUTH WHEN SHE USED TO GO TO PARTIES IN SAGE GREEN HOLDING A DAFFODIL AND THE FLIPPANCY OF HER MATURER YEARS
I'M VERY FOND OF HIM SHE SMILED TO COVER HER SHYNESS AND I FANCIED SHE HAD A FEAR THAT I WOULD MAKE THE SORT OF GIBE THAT SUCH A CONFESSION COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO ELICIT FROM ROSE WATERFORD
WAS A BOY OF SIXTEEN AT RUGBY
THOSE WHO COME AFTER US WILL MOVE THE YOUNGER GENERATION CONSCIOUS OF STRENGTH AND TUMULTUOUS HAVE DONE WITH KNOCKING AT THE DOOR THEY HAVE BURST IN AND SEATED THEMSELVES IN OUR SEATS
MISSUS JAY AWARE THAT IMPROPRIETY IS THE SOUL OF WIT MADE OBSERVATIONS IN TONES HARDLY ABOVE A WHISPER THAT
ONCE OR TWICE MISSUS STRICKLAND'S EYES RESTED ON HIM SOMEWHAT ANXIOUSLY AT LAST SHE ROSE AND SHEPHERDED THE LADIES OUT OF ONE ROOM
DURING THE SUMMER I MET MISSUS STRICKLAND NOT INFREQUENTLY I WENT NOW AND THEN TO PLEASANT LITTLE LUNCHEONS AT HER FLAT AND TO RATHER MORE FORMIDABLE TEA PARTIES WE TOOK A FANCY TO ONE ANOTHER
I HAVE A RECOLLECTION OF LARGE UNBENDING WOMEN WITH GREAT NOSES AND RAPACIOUS EYES WHO WORE THEIR CLOTHES AS THOUGH THEY WERE ARMOUR AND OF LITTLE MOUSE LIKE SPINSTERS WITH SOFT VOICES AND A SHREWD GLANCE
BUT I DO NOT REMEMBER SO CRUDE A PROMISCUITY AS SEEMS TO BE PRACTISED IN THE PRESENT DAY WE DID NOT THINK IT HYPOCRITICAL TO DRAW OVER OUR VAGARIES THE CURTAIN OF A DECENT SILENCE
ROSE WATERFORD HAD A BLISTERING TONGUE NO ONE COULD SAY SUCH BITTER THINGS ON THE OTHER HAND NO ONE COULD DO MORE CHARMING ONES THERE WAS ANOTHER THING I LIKED IN MISSUS STRICKLAND
BECAUSE WE LIVED IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD WE FELT FRIENDLY DISPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER THE ARMY AND NAVY STORES ARE A BOND OF UNION BETWEEN ALL WHO DWELL BETWEEN THE RIVER AND SAINT JAMES'S PARK
BUT NOW TO BE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE IS ABSURD
I FELT THEY EXPECTED ME TO SAY CLEVER THINGS AND I NEVER COULD THINK OF ANY TILL AFTER THE PARTY WAS OVER I TRIED TO CONCEAL MY EMBARRASSMENT BY HANDING ROUND CUPS OF TEA AND RATHER ILL CUT BREAD AND BUTTER
IT IS NOT WITHOUT MELANCHOLY THAT I WANDER AMONG MY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE WORLD OF LETTERS IN LONDON WHEN FIRST BASHFUL BUT EAGER I WAS INTRODUCED TO IT IT IS LONG SINCE I FREQUENTED IT AND
THEY EVER SEEMED TO ME QUITE REAL I REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT THEIR CONVERSATION BRILLIANT AND I USED TO LISTEN WITH ASTONISHMENT TO
AND I SAW HIM NOT INFREQUENTLY DURING THE DIFFICULT YEARS HE SPENT IN PARIS BUT I DO NOT SUPPOSE I SHOULD EVER HAVE SET DOWN MY RECOLLECTIONS IF THE HAZARDS OF THE WAR HAD NOT TAKEN ME TO TAHITI
THE AIR IS NOISY WITH THEIR SHOUTS OF THEIR ELDERS SOME BY IMITATING THE ANTICS OF YOUTH STRIVE TO PERSUADE THEMSELVES THAT THEIR DAY IS NOT YET OVER
SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE ASPERSIONS OF HER FRIENDS HE'S ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE AND HE'S A TYPICAL BROKER I THINK HE'D BORE YOU TO DEATH DOES HE BORE YOU I ASKED YOU SEE I HAPPEN TO BE HIS WIFE
LEAFY TREES SUGGESTED THE INFLUENCE OF WILLIAM MORRIS THERE WAS BLUE DELFT ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE AT THAT TIME THERE MUST HAVE BEEN FIVE HUNDRED DINING ROOMS IN LONDON DECORATED IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER IT WAS CHASTE ARTISTIC
THESE PERSONS HAD ACCEPTED WHY TO AVOID THE TEDIUM OF DINING TETE A TETE TO GIVE THEIR SERVANTS A REST BECAUSE THERE WAS NO REASON TO REFUSE BECAUSE THEY WERE OWED A DINNER
TURNING TO HIM GAILY SHE ATTEMPTED A SMALL JEST I ASKED HIM TO SHOW HIM THAT I REALLY HAD A HUSBAND I THINK HE WAS BEGINNING TO DOUBT IT
TO MY MIND THEY KNOW TOO MUCH AND FEEL TOO OBVIOUSLY I CANNOT STOMACH THE HEARTINESS WITH WHICH THEY SLAP ME ON THE BACK OR THE EMOTION WITH WHICH THEY HURL THEMSELVES ON MY BOSOM
WHEN I ARRIVED A LITTLE LATE BECAUSE IN MY FEAR OF BEING TOO EARLY I HAD WALKED THREE TIMES ROUND THE CATHEDRAL I FOUND THE PARTY ALREADY COMPLETE MISS WATERFORD WAS THERE AND MISSUS JAY RICHARD TWINING AND GEORGE ROAD WE WERE ALL WRITERS
THE WAR CRY SOUNDS HOLLOW IN THEIR MOUTH THEY ARE LIKE POOR WANTONS ATTEMPTING WITH PENCIL PAINT AND POWDER WITH SHRILL GAIETY TO RECOVER THE ILLUSION OF THEIR SPRING
CAN HARDLY BE SUPERFLUOUS WHAT WOULD WE NOT GIVE FOR THE REMINISCENCES OF SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN AS INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH EL GRECO AS I WAS WITH STRICKLAND
I NEVER CEASED TO BE FASCINATED BY THEIR PERSISTENCE IN EATING BUTTERED TOAST WITH THEIR GLOVES ON AND I OBSERVED WITH ADMIRATION THE UNCONCERN WITH WHICH THEY WIPED THEIR FINGERS ON THEIR CHAIR WHEN THEY THOUGHT NO ONE WAS LOOKING
SO THAT THEY MAY EXERCISE THEIR DEXTERITY IT GUSHES FORTH LIKE AN OIL WELL AND THE SYMPATHETIC POUR OUT THEIR SYMPATHY WITH AN ABANDON THAT IS SOMETIMES EMBARRASSING TO THEIR VICTIMS
I DESPAIRED OF EVER EXPRESSING MYSELF WITH SUCH APTNESS OR WITH SUCH FLUENCY IN THOSE DAYS CONVERSATION WAS STILL CULTIVATED AS AN ART
THEY'RE BOTH OF THEM THE IMAGE OF YOU I SAID YES I THINK THEY ARE MORE LIKE ME THAN THEIR FATHER WHY HAVE YOU NEVER LET ME MEET HIM I ASKED WOULD YOU LIKE TO
MISTER CRABBE CONTINUED TO WRITE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS I HAVE READ DESULTORILY THE WRITINGS OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION IT MAY BE THAT AMONG THEM A MORE FERVID KEATS A MORE ETHEREAL SHELLEY
BUT THE ODES OF KEATS AND OF WORDSWORTH A POEM OR TWO BY COLERIDGE A FEW MORE BY SHELLEY DISCOVERED VAST REALMS OF THE SPIRIT THAT NONE HAD EXPLORED BEFORE MISTER CRABBE WAS AS DEAD AS MUTTON BUT
WHEN SHE CAME TO KNOW WRITERS IT WAS LIKE ADVENTURING UPON A STAGE WHICH TILL THEN
CHAPTER TWO WHEN SO MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT CHARLES STRICKLAND IT MAY SEEM UNNECESSARY THAT I SHOULD WRITE MORE A PAINTER'S MONUMENT IS HIS WORK
SHE WAS A WOMAN OF THIRTY SEVEN RATHER TALL AND PLUMP WITHOUT BEING FAT
HE WROTE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS THEN CAME THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE NAPOLEONIC WARS AND THE POETS SANG NEW SONGS
OF EDITORS AND THE SORT OF CONTRIBUTIONS THEY WELCOMED HOW MUCH THEY PAID A THOUSAND AND WHETHER THEY PAID PROMPTLY OR OTHERWISE
OR TO WHILE AWAY THE TEDIUM OF A JOURNEY AND IF I MAY JUDGE FROM THE REVIEWS MANY OF THESE BOOKS ARE WELL AND CAREFULLY WRITTEN
MISTER CRABBE CONTINUED TO WRITE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS I THINK HE MUST HAVE READ THE VERSE OF THESE YOUNG MEN WHO WERE MAKING SO GREAT A STIR IN THE WORLD AND I FANCY HE FOUND IT POOR STUFF OF COURSE MUCH OF IT WAS
NEVER PREVENTED AN EDITOR FROM TAKING YOUR STUFF
I WAS LED UP TO MISSUS STRICKLAND AND FOR TEN MINUTES WE TALKED TOGETHER I NOTICED NOTHING ABOUT HER EXCEPT THAT SHE HAD A PLEASANT VOICE SHE HAD A FLAT IN WESTMINSTER OVERLOOKING THE UNFINISHED CATHEDRAL AND
THEN WE WOULD SPEAK OF THIS PUBLISHER AND OF THAT COMPARING THE GENEROSITY OF ONE WITH THE MEANNESS OF ANOTHER WE WOULD ARGUE WHETHER IT WAS BETTER TO GO TO ONE WHO GAVE HANDSOME ROYALTIES
AND ENTERTAINED WITH PROPER LAVISHNESS SHE HELD THEIR WEAKNESS FOR LIONS IN GOOD HUMOURED CONTEMPT BUT PLAYED TO THEM HER PART OF THE DISTINGUISHED WOMAN OF LETTERS WITH DECORUM
BUT I SEEK REFUGE IN NO SUCH EXCUSES I FORGET WHO IT WAS THAT RECOMMENDED MEN FOR THEIR SOUL'S GOOD TO DO EACH DAY TWO THINGS THEY DISLIKED
AND DULL WHEN WE LEFT I WALKED AWAY WITH MISS WATERFORD AND THE FINE DAY AND HER NEW HAT PERSUADED US TO SAUNTER THROUGH THE PARK
THE MORAL I DRAW IS THAT THE WRITER SHOULD SEEK HIS REWARD IN THE PLEASURE OF HIS WORK AND IN RELEASE FROM THE BURDEN OF HIS THOUGHT AND INDIFFERENT TO AUGHT ELSE CARE NOTHING FOR PRAISE OR CENSURE
THERE WERE TEN PEOPLE THEY MET WITH INDIFFERENCE AND WOULD PART WITH RELIEF IT WAS OF COURSE A PURELY SOCIAL FUNCTION THE STRICKLANDS OWED DINNERS TO A NUMBER OF PERSONS WHOM THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN AND SO HAD ASKED THEM
IF THE NOVELS THAT DESCRIBE ITS PRESENT SINGULARITIES ARE ACCURATE
I WANTED NO ONE TO TAKE NOTICE OF ME SO THAT I COULD OBSERVE THESE FAMOUS CREATURES AT MY EASE AND LISTEN TO THE CLEVER THINGS THEY SAID
FROM AN ERA IN WHICH HE HAD HIS PLACE INTO ONE WHICH IS STRANGE TO HIM AND THEN THE CURIOUS ARE OFFERED ONE OF THE MOST SINGULAR SPECTACLES IN THE HUMAN COMEDY WHO NOW FOR EXAMPLE THINKS OF GEORGE CRABBE
HER SKIN WAS RATHER SALLOW HER DARK HAIR WAS ELABORATELY DRESSED SHE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN OF THE THREE WHOSE FACE WAS FREE OF MAKE UP AND BY CONTRAST WITH THE OTHERS SHE SEEMED SIMPLE AND UNAFFECTED
SHE HAD LED A VERY QUIET YOUTH IN THE COUNTRY AND THE BOOKS THAT CAME DOWN FROM MUDIE'S LIBRARY BROUGHT WITH THEM NOT ONLY THEIR OWN ROMANCE BUT THE ROMANCE OF LONDON SHE HAD A REAL PASSION FOR READING RARE IN HER KIND
FOR EVERY DAY I HAVE GOT UP AND I HAVE GONE TO BED
FAILURE OR SUCCESS NOW THE WAR HAS COME
MISSUS STRICKLAND DID NOT TALK MUCH BUT SHE HAD A PLEASANT GIFT FOR KEEPING THE CONVERSATION GENERAL AND WHEN THERE WAS A PAUSE
IN WASTING ON TEDIOUS EXERCISES THE BRIEF SPAN OF HIS LIFE IT WAS THE KIND OF PARTY WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER WHY THE HOSTESS HAS TROUBLED TO BID HER GUESTS AND WHY THE GUESTS HAVE TROUBLED TO COME
THE GREEN CURTAINS WITH THEIR PEACOCK DESIGN HUNG IN STRAIGHT LINES AND THE GREEN CARPET
THE SPADE WAS NOT INVARIABLY CALLED A BLOODY SHOVEL WOMAN HAD NOT YET ALTOGETHER COME INTO HER OWN
WHICH TENDED TO HIGH HEELS AND PARIS FROCKS WORE A NEW HAT
HAS ALREADY PUBLISHED NUMBERS THE WORLD WILL WILLINGLY REMEMBER I CANNOT TELL I ADMIRE THEIR POLISH THEIR YOUTH IS ALREADY SO ACCOMPLISHED THAT IT SEEMS ABSURD TO SPEAK OF PROMISE
THE MEN WERE SELDOM ECCENTRIC IN APPEARANCE THEY TRIED TO LOOK AS LITTLE LIKE AUTHORS AS POSSIBLE
AND ONE OF HER GUESTS HAD FAILED HER SHE ASKED ME TO STOP THE GAP SHE WROTE IT'S ONLY DECENT TO WARN YOU THAT YOU WILL BE BORED TO EXTINCTION IT WAS A THOROUGHLY DULL PARTY FROM THE BEGINNING BUT
PERHAPS HE DID NOT TALK VERY MUCH AND I FANCIED THERE WAS TOWARDS THE END A LOOK OF FATIGUE IN THE FACES OF THE WOMEN ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THEY WERE FINDING HIM HEAVY
MISSUS STRICKLAND ASKED ME FOR MY ADDRESS AND A FEW DAYS LATER I RECEIVED AN INVITATION TO LUNCHEON MY ENGAGEMENTS WERE FEW AND I WAS GLAD TO ACCEPT
I NO LONGER WONDERED THAT MISSUS STRICKLAND FELT A CERTAIN EMBARRASSMENT ABOUT HIM HE WAS SCARCELY A CREDIT TO A WOMAN WHO WANTED TO MAKE HERSELF A POSITION IN THE WORLD OF ART AND LETTERS IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE HAD NO SOCIAL GIFTS BUT
SHE HESITATED A LITTLE HER EYES GREW TENDER HE DOESN'T PRETEND TO BE A GENIUS HE DOESN'T EVEN MAKE MUCH MONEY ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE BUT HE'S AWFULLY GOOD AND KIND
AND BECAUSE I THOUGHT NO ONE WAS IN THE LEAST CONCERNED WITH ME EXAMINED STRICKLAND AT MY EASE HE WAS BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED I DO NOT KNOW WHY I HAD IMAGINED HIM SLENDER AND OF INSIGNIFICANT APPEARANCE
I WAS VERY YOUNG AND PERHAPS SHE LIKED THE IDEA OF GUIDING MY VIRGIN STEPS ON THE HARD ROAD OF LETTERS WHILE FOR ME IT WAS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMEONE I COULD GO TO WITH MY SMALL TROUBLES CERTAIN OF AN ATTENTIVE EAR AND REASONABLE COUNSEL
THE FATE WHICH AWAITS THEM WHAT CHANCE IS THERE THAT ANY BOOK WILL MAKE ITS WAY AMONG THAT MULTITUDE AND THE SUCCESSFUL BOOKS ARE BUT THE SUCCESSES OF A SEASON HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT PAINS THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN AT
BUT SHE DOESN'T OFTEN HAVE PEOPLE TO DINNER HE'S VERY QUIET HE'S NOT IN THE LEAST INTERESTED IN LITERATURE OR THE ARTS WHY DO NICE WOMEN MARRY DULL MEN BECAUSE INTELLIGENT MEN WON'T MARRY NICE WOMEN
THERE AS IS NOTORIOUS HE SPENT THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE AND THERE I CAME ACROSS PERSONS WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH HIM I FIND MYSELF IN A POSITION TO THROW LIGHT ON JUST THAT PART OF HIS TRAGIC CAREER
THE WISER GO THEIR WAY WITH A DECENT GRACE IN THEIR CHASTENED SMILE IS AN INDULGENT MOCKERY THEY REMEMBER THAT THEY TOO TROD DOWN A SATED GENERATION WITH JUST SUCH CLAMOR AND
BUT HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INFLUENCE ON HER CONVICTIONS IS THERE A MISTER STRICKLAND I ASKED OH YES HE'S SOMETHING IN THE CITY I BELIEVE HE'S A STOCKBROKER HE'S VERY DULL ARE THEY GOOD FRIENDS
WHICH HAS REMAINED MOST OBSCURE IF THEY WHO BELIEVE IN STRICKLAND'S GREATNESS ARE RIGHT THE PERSONAL NARRATIVES OF SUCH AS KNEW HIM IN THE FLESH
WHO FOR THE MOST PART ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THE AUTHOR THAN IN HIS BOOK IN THE PAINTER THAN IN HIS PICTURES AND SHE INVENTED A WORLD OF THE IMAGINATION IN WHICH SHE LIVED WITH A FREEDOM SHE NEVER ACQUIRED IN THE WORLD OF EVERY DAY
AND THEIR DREAMS A TRIFLE DULL I DO NOT LIKE THEM I AM ON THE SHELF I WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS BUT
ROSE WATERFORD WAS A CYNIC SHE LOOKED UPON LIFE AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WRITING NOVELS AND THE PUBLIC AS HER RAW MATERIAL NOW AND THEN SHE INVITED MEMBERS OF IT TO HER HOUSE IF THEY SHOWED AN APPRECIATION OF HER TALENT
BUT ALL THIS IS BY THE WAY I WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN I WROTE MY FIRST BOOK BY A LUCKY CHANCE IT EXCITED ATTENTION AND VARIOUS PERSONS SOUGHT MY ACQUAINTANCE
THE NEW EVANGEL WAS OLD WHEN NINEVEH REARED HER GREATNESS TO THE SKY
THE VENUE IS DIFFERENT CHELSEA AND BLOOMSBURY HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF HAMPSTEAD NOTTING HILL GATE AND HIGH STREET KENSINGTON
IT WAS AT HER HOUSE ONE DAY THAT I MET CHARLES STRICKLAND'S WIFE MISS WATERFORD WAS GIVING A TEA PARTY AND HER SMALL ROOM WAS MORE THAN USUALLY FULL EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE TALKING AND I SITTING IN SILENCE FELT AWKWARD BUT
HE HAD HIS MOTHER'S CANDID BROW AND FINE REFLECTIVE EYES HE LOOKED CLEAN HEALTHY AND NORMAL I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S VERY CLEVER SHE SAID ONE DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE PHOTOGRAPH BUT I KNOW HE'S GOOD HE HAS A CHARMING CHARACTER
SHE SAW THEM DRAMATICALLY AND REALLY SEEMED HERSELF TO LIVE A LARGER LIFE BECAUSE SHE ENTERTAINED THEM
THE DAUGHTER WAS FOURTEEN HER HAIR THICK AND DARK LIKE HER MOTHER'S FELL OVER HER SHOULDERS IN FINE PROFUSION AND SHE HAD THE SAME KINDLY EXPRESSION AND SEDATE UNTROUBLED EYES
I SHOULD BE THRICE A FOOL IF I DID IT FOR AUGHT BUT MY OWN ENTERTAINMENT
IT MUST HAVE BEEN BAD FOR THE FURNITURE BUT I SUPPOSE THE HOSTESS TOOK HER REVENGE ON THE FURNITURE OF HER FRIENDS WHEN IN TURN SHE VISITED THEM SOME OF THEM WERE DRESSED FASHIONABLY
THE PENDULUM SWINGS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS THE CIRCLE IS EVER TRAVELLED ANEW SOMETIMES A MAN SURVIVES A CONSIDERABLE TIME
WE BEGAN TO CHAT ABOUT VINTAGES AND TOBACCO THE K C TOLD US OF A CASE HE WAS ENGAGED IN AND THE COLONEL TALKED ABOUT POLO I HAD NOTHING TO SAY AND SO SAT SILENT TRYING POLITELY TO SHOW INTEREST IN THE CONVERSATION
NOT GOOD LOOKING AND YET NOT UGLY FOR HIS FEATURES WERE RATHER GOOD
THE MEN WERE SOLID THERE WAS ABOUT ALL OF THEM AN AIR OF WELL SATISFIED PROSPERITY EVERYONE TALKED A LITTLE LOUDER THAN NATURAL IN AN INSTINCTIVE DESIRE TO MAKE THE PARTY GO AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE IN THE ROOM
I MARVEL AT THE FELICITY OF THEIR STYLE BUT WITH ALL THEIR COPIOUSNESS THEIR VOCABULARY SUGGESTS THAT THEY FINGERED ROGET'S THESAURUS IN THEIR CRADLES THEY SAY NOTHING TO ME
RICHARD TWINING BUBBLED OVER WITH QUAINT ABSURDITIES AND GEORGE ROAD CONSCIOUS THAT HE NEED NOT EXHIBIT A BRILLIANCY WHICH WAS ALMOST A BY WORD OPENED HIS MOUTH ONLY TO PUT FOOD INTO IT
I THINK I SHOULD LIKE HIM VERY MUCH I'LL ASK YOU TO DINE WITH US QUIETLY SOME TIME BUT MIND YOU COME AT YOUR OWN RISK DON'T BLAME ME IF YOU HAVE A VERY DULL EVENING
THEY TALKED OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND OF GOLF OF THEIR CHILDREN AND THE LATEST PLAY OF THE PICTURES AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF THE WEATHER AND THEIR PLANS FOR THE HOLIDAYS
CHAPTER FOUR NO ONE WAS KINDER TO ME AT THAT TIME THAN ROSE WATERFORD SHE COMBINED A MASCULINE INTELLIGENCE WITH A FEMININE PERVERSITY AND THE NOVELS SHE WROTE WERE ORIGINAL AND DISCONCERTING
HE WAS A FAMOUS POET IN HIS DAY AND THE WORLD RECOGNISED HIS GENIUS WITH A UNANIMITY WHICH THE GREATER COMPLEXITY OF MODERN LIFE HAS RENDERED INFREQUENT HE HAD LEARNT HIS CRAFT AT THE SCHOOL OF ALEXANDER POPE AND
THE ARTIST HAS THIS ADVANTAGE OVER THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT HIS FRIENDS OFFER NOT ONLY THEIR APPEARANCE AND THEIR CHARACTER TO HIS SATIRE BUT ALSO THEIR WORK
I HAVE NEVER FAILED TO READ THE LITERARY SUPPLEMENT OF THE TIMES IT IS A SALUTARY DISCIPLINE TO CONSIDER THE VAST NUMBER OF BOOKS THAT ARE WRITTEN THE FAIR HOPES WITH WHICH THEIR AUTHORS SEE THEM PUBLISHED AND
STRICKLAND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND MOVING TO THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE TOOK HIS PLACE BETWEEN THE K C AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL HE PASSED ROUND THE PORT AGAIN AND HANDED US CIGARS THE K C REMARKED ON THE EXCELLENCE OF THE WINE AND STRICKLAND TOLD US WHERE HE GOT IT
TO GO INSTANTLY TO GENEVA COME WITH ME HENRY TO ORDER THE HORSES DURING OUR WALK CLERVAL ENDEAVOURED TO SAY A FEW WORDS OF CONSOLATION HE COULD ONLY EXPRESS HIS HEARTFELT SYMPATHY POOR WILLIAM SAID HE DEAR LOVELY CHILD
THAT REPORT YOU SAY IS FALSE AND BE ASSURED DEAR JUSTINE THAT NOTHING CAN SHAKE MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU FOR A MOMENT BUT YOUR OWN CONFESSION I DID CONFESS BUT I CONFESSED A LIE
BUT WORDS CANNOT CONVEY AN IDEA OF THE HEART SICKENING DESPAIR THAT I THEN ENDURED THE PERSON TO WHOM I ADDRESSED MYSELF ADDED THAT JUSTINE HAD ALREADY CONFESSED HER GUILT THAT EVIDENCE HE OBSERVED
MY COUSIN REPLIED I IT IS DECIDED AS YOU MAY HAVE EXPECTED ALL JUDGES HAD RATHER THAT TEN INNOCENT SHOULD SUFFER THAN THAT ONE GUILTY SHOULD ESCAPE BUT SHE HAS CONFESSED
I AM SAID SHE THE COUSIN OF THE UNHAPPY CHILD WHO WAS MURDERED OR RATHER HIS SISTER FOR I WAS EDUCATED BY AND HAVE LIVED WITH HIS PARENTS EVER SINCE AND EVEN LONG BEFORE HIS BIRTH IT MAY THEREFORE BE
SHE NURSED MADAME FRANKENSTEIN MY AUNT IN HER LAST ILLNESS WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION AND CARE AND AFTERWARDS ATTENDED HER OWN MOTHER DURING A TEDIOUS ILLNESS IN A MANNER THAT EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF ALL WHO KNEW HER
YOUR DISASTER IS IRREPARABLE
MY OWN SPIRIT LET LOOSE FROM THE GRAVE AND FORCED TO DESTROY ALL THAT WAS DEAR TO ME DAY DAWNED AND I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE TOWN THE GATES WERE OPEN AND I HASTENED TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE
NOTHING IN HUMAN SHAPE COULD HAVE DESTROYED THE FAIR CHILD HE WAS THE MURDERER I COULD NOT DOUBT IT THE MERE PRESENCE OF THE IDEA WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF THE FACT I THOUGHT OF PURSUING THE DEVIL
RISE MY POOR GIRL SAID ELIZABETH WHY DO YOU KNEEL IF YOU ARE INNOCENT I AM NOT ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES I BELIEVED YOU GUILTLESS NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY EVIDENCE UNTIL I HEARD THAT YOU HAD YOURSELF DECLARED YOUR GUILT
WE HAVE NOT ONLY LOST THAT LOVELY DARLING BOY BUT THIS POOR GIRL WHOM I SINCERELY LOVE IS TO BE TORN AWAY BY EVEN A WORSE FATE IF SHE IS CONDEMNED I NEVER SHALL KNOW JOY MORE BUT SHE WILL NOT I AM SURE SHE WILL NOT
AND THE OFFICER GUESSED THE CAUSE OF MY VISIT THE BALLOTS HAD BEEN THROWN THEY WERE ALL BLACK AND JUSTINE WAS CONDEMNED I CANNOT PRETEND TO DESCRIBE WHAT I THEN FELT I HAD BEFORE EXPERIENCED SENSATIONS OF HORROR
BUT THE RAIN STILL CONTINUED AND THE SCENE WAS ENVELOPED IN AN IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS I REVOLVED IN MY MIND THE EVENTS WHICH I HAD UNTIL NOW SOUGHT TO FORGET THE WHOLE TRAIN OF MY PROGRESS TOWARD THE CREATION THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORKS OF MY OWN HANDS AT MY BEDSIDE
AND INDEED EVERY HUMAN BEING WAS GUILTLESS OF THIS MURDER I HAD NO FEAR THEREFORE THAT ANY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE COULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD STRONG ENOUGH TO CONVICT HER MY TALE WAS NOT ONE TO ANNOUNCE PUBLICLY ITS ASTOUNDING HORROR WOULD BE LOOKED UPON AS MADNESS BY THE VULGAR
ITS DEPARTURE TWO YEARS HAD NOW NEARLY ELAPSED SINCE THE NIGHT ON WHICH HE FIRST RECEIVED LIFE AND WAS THIS HIS FIRST CRIME ALAS I HAD TURNED LOOSE INTO THE WORLD A DEPRAVED WRETCH WHOSE DELIGHT WAS IN CARNAGE AND MISERY
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO DISCOVER WHAT I KNEW OF THE MURDERER AND CAUSE INSTANT PURSUIT TO BE MADE BUT I PAUSED WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE STORY THAT I HAD TO TELL A BEING WHOM I MYSELF HAD FORMED AND ENDUED WITH LIFE
I COULD NOT ANSWER NO JUSTINE SAID ELIZABETH HE IS MORE CONVINCED OF YOUR INNOCENCE THAN I WAS FOR EVEN WHEN HE HEARD THAT YOU HAD CONFESSED HE DID NOT CREDIT IT I TRULY THANK HIM
JUDGED INDECENT IN ME TO COME FORWARD ON THIS OCCASION BUT WHEN I SEE A FELLOW CREATURE ABOUT TO PERISH THROUGH THE COWARDICE OF HER PRETENDED FRIENDS I WISH TO BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK THAT I MAY SAY WHAT I KNOW OF HER CHARACTER
I KNOW THE MURDERER JUSTINE POOR GOOD JUSTINE IS INNOCENT AT THAT INSTANT MY FATHER ENTERED I SAW UNHAPPINESS DEEPLY IMPRESSED ON HIS COUNTENANCE BUT HE ENDEAVOURED TO WELCOME ME CHEERFULLY
AND HEARD THE HARSH UNFEELING REASONING OF THESE MEN MY PURPOSED AVOWAL DIED AWAY ON MY LIPS THUS I MIGHT PROCLAIM MYSELF A MADMAN BUT NOT REVOKE THE SENTENCE PASSED UPON MY WRETCHED VICTIM SHE PERISHED ON THE SCAFFOLD
BUT THAT HE DID NOT RETURN THIS ACCOUNT
UNTIL THE EYE RECOVERED ITSELF FROM THE PRECEDING FLASH THE STORM AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN SWITZERLAND APPEARED AT ONCE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE HEAVENS THE MOST VIOLENT STORM HUNG EXACTLY NORTH OF THE TOWN OVER THE PART OF THE LAKE WHICH LIES BETWEEN THE PROMONTORY OF BELRIVE
THE ROAD RAN BY THE SIDE OF THE LAKE WHICH BECAME NARROWER AS I APPROACHED MY NATIVE TOWN I DISCOVERED MORE DISTINCTLY THE BLACK SIDES OF JURA AND THE
HAD HE NOT MURDERED MY BROTHER NO ONE CAN CONCEIVE THE ANGUISH I SUFFERED DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT WHICH I SPENT COLD AND WET IN THE OPEN AIR BUT I DID NOT FEEL THE INCONVENIENCE OF THE WEATHER
THE APPEARANCE OF JUSTINE WAS CALM SHE WAS DRESSED IN MOURNING AND HER COUNTENANCE ALWAYS ENGAGING WAS RENDERED BY THE SOLEMNITY OF HER FEELINGS EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL
I ATTEMPTED TO PREVENT HER BUT SHE PERSISTED AND ENTERING THE ROOM WHERE IT LAY HASTILY EXAMINED THE NECK OF THE VICTIM AND CLASPING HER HANDS EXCLAIMED O GOD I HAVE MURDERED MY DARLING CHILD SHE FAINTED AND WAS RESTORED WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY
ELIZABETH ALSO SUFFERED EXTREME ANGUISH ABOUT FIVE IN THE MORNING I DISCOVERED MY LOVELY BOY WHOM THE NIGHT BEFORE I HAD SEEN BLOOMING AND ACTIVE IN HEALTH STRETCHED ON THE GRASS LIVID AND MOTIONLESS
GOD KNOWS SHE SAID HOW ENTIRELY I AM INNOCENT BUT I DO NOT PRETEND THAT MY PROTESTATIONS SHOULD ACQUIT ME
A SENSE OF MORTAL AGONY CREPT OVER MY FRAME BEFORE I HAD ONLY IMAGINED THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MY DESOLATED HOME THE REALITY CAME ON ME AS A NEW AND A NOT LESS TERRIBLE DISASTER I TRIED TO CALM ERNEST
ITS GIGANTIC STATURE AND THE DEFORMITY OF ITS ASPECT MORE HIDEOUS THAN BELONGS TO HUMANITY INSTANTLY INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS THE WRETCH THE FILTHY DAEMON TO WHOM I HAD GIVEN LIFE WHAT DID HE THERE
WHAT COULD IT MEAN HAD MY EYES DECEIVED ME AND WAS I REALLY AS MAD AS THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD BELIEVE ME TO BE IF I DISCLOSED THE OBJECT OF MY SUSPICIONS I HASTENED TO RETURN HOME AND ELIZABETH EAGERLY DEMANDED THE RESULT
AND WHICH WOULD GIVE AN AIR OF DELIRIUM TO A TALE OTHERWISE SO UTTERLY IMPROBABLE I WELL KNEW THAT IF ANY OTHER HAD COMMUNICATED SUCH A RELATION TO ME
BUT WITH FEELINGS OF PEACE AND GENTLENESS THAT WILL HEAL INSTEAD OF FESTERING THE WOUNDS OF OUR MINDS ENTER THE HOUSE OF MOURNING MY FRIEND BUT WITH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION FOR THOSE WHO LOVE YOU AND NOT WITH HATRED FOR YOUR ENEMIES
I AM WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ACCUSED I HAVE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HER AT ONE TIME FOR FIVE AND AT ANOTHER FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS DURING ALL THAT PERIOD SHE APPEARED TO ME THE MOST AMIABLE AND BENEVOLENT OF HUMAN CREATURES
NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE BODY OF THE MURDERED CHILD HAD BEEN AFTERWARDS FOUND THE WOMAN ASKED HER WHAT SHE DID THERE BUT SHE LOOKED VERY STRANGELY AND ONLY RETURNED A CONFUSED AND UNINTELLIGIBLE ANSWER SHE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK
VICTOR HE IS MURDERED I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE YOU BUT WILL SIMPLY RELATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TRANSACTION LAST THURSDAY MAY SEVENTH I MY NIECE AND YOUR TWO BROTHERS WENT TO WALK IN PLAINPALAIS
YOU PERHAPS WILL FIND SOME MEANS TO JUSTIFY MY POOR GUILTLESS JUSTINE ALAS WHO IS SAFE IF SHE BE CONVICTED OF CRIME I RELY ON HER INNOCENCE AS CERTAINLY AS I DO UPON MY OWN OUR MISFORTUNE IS DOUBLY HARD TO US
THAT WILLIAM HAD RUN AWAY TO HIDE HIMSELF AND THAT HE VAINLY SOUGHT FOR HIM
I PASSED A NIGHT OF UNMINGLED WRETCHEDNESS IN THE MORNING I WENT TO THE COURT MY LIPS AND THROAT WERE PARCHED I DARED NOT ASK THE FATAL QUESTION BUT I WAS KNOWN
A VILLAGE AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF A LEAGUE FROM THE CITY THE SKY WAS SERENE AND AS I WAS UNABLE TO REST I RESOLVED TO VISIT THE SPOT WHERE MY POOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN MURDERED AS I COULD NOT PASS THROUGH THE TOWN I WAS OBLIGED TO CROSS THE LAKE IN A BOAT TO ARRIVE AT PLAINPALAIS
HOW HEAVILY AND FATALLY THIS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WEIGHS AGAINST ME BUT I HAVE NO POWER OF EXPLAINING IT AND WHEN I HAVE EXPRESSED MY UTTER IGNORANCE I AM ONLY LEFT TO CONJECTURE CONCERNING THE PROBABILITIES BY WHICH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLACED IN MY POCKET
WHO BUT A NATIVE CAN TELL THE DELIGHT I TOOK IN AGAIN BEHOLDING THY STREAMS THY MOUNTAINS AND MORE THAN ALL THY LOVELY LAKE YET AS I DREW NEARER HOME GRIEF AND FEAR AGAIN OVERCAME ME
SHE INDEED GAINED THE RESIGNATION SHE DESIRED BUT I THE TRUE MURDERER FELT THE NEVER DYING WORM ALIVE IN MY BOSOM WHICH ALLOWED OF NO HOPE OR CONSOLATION ELIZABETH ALSO WEPT AND WAS UNHAPPY
THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE PRODUCED AGAINST HER I BELIEVE AND RELY ON HER PERFECT INNOCENCE SHE HAD NO TEMPTATION FOR SUCH AN ACTION AS TO THE BAUBLE ON WHICH THE CHIEF PROOF RESTS
WHICH STOOD OVER THE MANTEL PIECE IT WAS AN HISTORICAL SUBJECT
WAS HARDLY REQUIRED IN SO GLARING A CASE BUT I AM GLAD OF IT AND INDEED NONE OF OUR JUDGES LIKE TO CONDEMN A CRIMINAL UPON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE BE IT EVER SO DECISIVE THIS WAS STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED INTELLIGENCE
WE DO ALSO UNFORTUNATELY REPLIED MY FATHER FOR INDEED I HAD RATHER HAVE BEEN FOR EVER IGNORANT THAN HAVE DISCOVERED SO MUCH DEPRAVITY AND UNGRATITUDE IN ONE I VALUED SO HIGHLY MY DEAR FATHER YOU ARE MISTAKEN JUSTINE IS INNOCENT
ALL LOOKED ON ME AS A WRETCH DOOMED TO IGNOMINY AND PERDITION WHAT COULD I DO IN AN EVIL HOUR I SUBSCRIBED TO A LIE AND NOW ONLY AM I TRULY MISERABLE SHE PAUSED WEEPING
HE NOW SLEEPS WITH HIS ANGEL MOTHER WHO THAT HAD SEEN HIM BRIGHT AND JOYOUS IN HIS YOUNG BEAUTY BUT MUST WEEP OVER HIS UNTIMELY LOSS TO DIE SO MISERABLY TO FEEL THE MURDERER'S GRASP HOW MUCH MORE A MURDERED THAT COULD DESTROY RADIANT INNOCENCE POOR LITTLE FELLOW
ELIZABETH SAW EVEN THIS LAST RESOURCE HER EXCELLENT DISPOSITIONS AND IRREPROACHABLE CONDUCT ABOUT TO FAIL THE ACCUSED WHEN ALTHOUGH VIOLENTLY AGITATED SHE DESIRED PERMISSION TO ADDRESS THE COURT
ONE ONLY CONSOLATION HAVE WE HIS FRIENDS MOURN AND WEEP BUT HE IS AT REST THE PANG IS OVER HIS SUFFERINGS ARE AT AN END FOR EVER A SOD COVERS HIS GENTLE FORM AND HE KNOWS NO PAIN HE CAN NO LONGER BE A SUBJECT FOR PITY
DURING THIS CONVERSATION I HAD RETIRED TO A CORNER OF THE PRISON ROOM WHERE I COULD CONCEAL THE HORRID ANGUISH THAT POSSESSED ME DESPAIR WHO DARED TALK OF THAT
I SHOULD HAVE WILLINGLY GIVEN IT TO HER SO MUCH DO I ESTEEM AND VALUE HER A MURMUR OF APPROBATION FOLLOWED ELIZABETH'S SIMPLE AND POWERFUL APPEAL BUT IT WAS EXCITED BY HER GENEROUS INTERFERENCE AND NOT IN FAVOUR OF POOR JUSTINE
BY MY TEARS AND PRAYERS YOU SHALL NOT DIE YOU MY PLAYFELLOW MY COMPANION
SHE WORKED UP HER MIND TO AN APPEARANCE OF COURAGE WHEN SHE ENTERED THE COURT SHE THREW HER EYES ROUND IT AND QUICKLY DISCOVERED WHERE WE WERE SEATED A TEAR SEEMED TO DIM HER EYE WHEN SHE SAW US BUT SHE QUICKLY RECOVERED HERSELF
WE MUST RESERVE THAT FOR HIS MISERABLE SURVIVORS CLERVAL SPOKE THUS AS WE HURRIED THROUGH THE STREETS THE WORDS IMPRESSED THEMSELVES ON MY MIND AND I REMEMBERED THEM AFTERWARDS IN SOLITUDE BUT NOW AS SOON AS THE HORSES ARRIVED
AND THEN CONTINUED I THOUGHT WITH HORROR MY SWEET LADY
SHE THREW HERSELF AT THE FEET OF ELIZABETH WEEPING BITTERLY MY COUSIN WEPT ALSO OH JUSTINE SAID SHE WHY DID YOU ROB ME OF MY LAST CONSOLATION I RELIED ON YOUR INNOCENCE AND ALTHOUGH I WAS THEN VERY WRETCHED
HAD MET ME AT MIDNIGHT AMONG THE PRECIPICES OF AN INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAIN
BELONGING TO A COTTAGE BEING UNWILLING TO CALL UP THE INHABITANTS TO WHOM SHE WAS WELL KNOWN MOST OF THE NIGHT SHE SPENT HERE WATCHING TOWARDS MORNING SHE BELIEVED THAT SHE SLEPT FOR A FEW MINUTES SOME STEPS DISTURBED HER AND SHE AWOKE
I BELIEVED IN HER INNOCENCE I KNEW IT COULD THE DEMON WHO HAD
AND REPRESENTED CAROLINE BEAUFORT IN AN AGONY OF DESPAIR KNEELING BY THE COFFIN OF HER DEAD FATHER HER GARB WAS RUSTIC AND HER CHEEK PALE BUT THERE WAS AN AIR OF DIGNITY AND BEAUTY THAT HARDLY PERMITTED THE SENTIMENT OF PITY
WHO HAD GONE ON BEFORE WERE NOT TO BE FOUND WE ACCORDINGLY RESTED ON A SEAT UNTIL THEY SHOULD RETURN PRESENTLY ERNEST CAME AND ENQUIRED IF WE HAD SEEN HIS BROTHER HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN PLAYING WITH HIM
I QUITTED MY SEAT AND WALKED ON ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS AND STORM INCREASED EVERY MINUTE AND THE THUNDER BURST WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH OVER MY HEAD IT WAS ECHOED FROM SALEVE THE JURAS AND THE ALPS OF SAVOY
THERE WAS THE SAME CANDOUR THE SAME VIVACITY BUT IT WAS ALLIED TO AN EXPRESSION MORE FULL OF SENSIBILITY AND INTELLECT SHE WELCOMED ME WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION YOUR ARRIVAL MY DEAR COUSIN SAID SHE FILLS ME WITH HOPE
JUSTINE SHOOK HER HEAD MOURNFULLY I DO NOT FEAR TO DIE SHE SAID THAT PANG IS PAST GOD RAISES MY WEAKNESS AND GIVES ME COURAGE TO ENDURE THE WORST
BELOW THIS PICTURE WAS A MINIATURE OF WILLIAM AND MY TEARS FLOWED WHEN I LOOKED UPON IT WHILE I WAS THUS ENGAGED ERNEST ENTERED
MY DEAR VICTOR YOU HAVE PROBABLY WAITED IMPATIENTLY FOR A LETTER TO FIX THE DATE OF YOUR RETURN TO US AND I WAS AT FIRST TEMPTED TO WRITE ONLY A FEW LINES MERELY MENTIONING THE DAY ON WHICH I SHOULD EXPECT YOU
YOUR AFFECTIONATE AND AFFLICTED FATHER ALPHONSE FRANKENSTEIN GENEVA MAY TWELFTH
IN AN IGNOMINIOUS GRAVE AND I THE CAUSE A THOUSAND TIMES RATHER WOULD I HAVE CONFESSED MYSELF GUILTY OF THE CRIME ASCRIBED TO JUSTINE BUT I WAS ABSENT WHEN IT WAS COMMITTED AND SUCH A DECLARATION WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS THE RAVINGS OF A MADMAN
HE THREATENED AND MENACED UNTIL I ALMOST BEGAN TO THINK THAT I WAS THE MONSTER THAT HE SAID I WAS HE THREATENED EXCOMMUNICATION AND HELL FIRE IN MY LAST MOMENTS IF I CONTINUED OBDURATE
HOW KIND AND GENEROUS YOU ARE EVERY ONE ELSE BELIEVES IN HER GUILT
WHICH MIGHT HAVE STAGGERED ANYONE WHO HAD NOT SUCH PROOF OF HER INNOCENCE AS I HAD SHE HAD BEEN OUT THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND TOWARDS MORNING HAD BEEN PERCEIVED BY A MARKET WOMAN
I CANNOT LIVE IN THIS WORLD OF MISERY JUSTINE ASSUMED AN AIR OF CHEERFULNESS WHILE SHE WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSED HER BITTER TEARS SHE EMBRACED ELIZABETH AND SAID IN A VOICE OF HALF SUPPRESSED EMOTION
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN REPLIED MY BROTHER IN ACCENTS OF WONDER BUT TO US THE DISCOVERY WE HAVE MADE COMPLETES OUR MISERY NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE IT AT FIRST AND EVEN NOW ELIZABETH WILL NOT BE CONVINCED
AND THEN I SHALL BE HAPPY AGAIN EVEN AFTER THE SAD DEATH OF MY LITTLE WILLIAM SHE IS INNOCENT MY ELIZABETH SAID I AND THAT SHALL BE PROVED FEAR NOTHING BUT LET YOUR SPIRITS BE CHEERED BY THE ASSURANCE OF HER ACQUITTAL
I REMAINED TWO DAYS AT LAUSANNE
SHE MOST OF ALL SAID ERNEST REQUIRES CONSOLATION SHE ACCUSED HERSELF OF HAVING CAUSED THE DEATH OF MY BROTHER AND THAT MADE HER VERY WRETCHED BUT SINCE THE MURDERER HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THE MURDERER DISCOVERED GOOD GOD HOW CAN THAT BE
AND YET SHE HAS COMMITTED A MURDER SOON AFTER WE HEARD THAT THE POOR VICTIM HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE MY COUSIN MY FATHER WISHED HER NOT TO GO BUT SAID THAT HE LEFT IT TO HER OWN JUDGMENT AND FEELINGS TO DECIDE
AND A LOOK OF SORROWFUL AFFECTION SEEMED TO ATTEST HER UTTER GUILTLESSNESS THE TRIAL BEGAN AND AFTER THE ADVOCATE AGAINST HER HAD STATED THE CHARGE SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED SEVERAL STRANGE FACTS COMBINED AGAINST HER
I WEPT LIKE A CHILD DEAR MOUNTAINS MY OWN BEAUTIFUL LAKE HOW DO YOU WELCOME YOUR WANDERER YOUR SUMMITS ARE CLEAR THE SKY AND LAKE ARE BLUE AND PLACID IS THIS TO PROGNOSTICATE PEACE OR TO MOCK AT MY UNHAPPINESS
I SLACKENED MY PROGRESS I COULD HARDLY SUSTAIN THE MULTITUDE OF FEELINGS THAT CROWDED INTO MY MIND I PASSED THROUGH SCENES FAMILIAR TO MY YOUTH BUT WHICH I HAD NOT SEEN FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS HOW ALTERED EVERY THING MIGHT BE DURING THAT TIME
I BEG PERMISSION TO HAVE A FEW WITNESSES EXAMINED CONCERNING MY CHARACTER AND IF THEIR TESTIMONY SHALL NOT OVERWEIGH MY SUPPOSED GUILT I MUST BE CONDEMNED ALTHOUGH I WOULD PLEDGE MY SALVATION ON MY INNOCENCE
HE WHO WOULD SPEND EACH VITAL DROP OF BLOOD FOR YOUR SAKES WHO HAS NO THOUGHT NOR SENSE OF JOY EXCEPT AS IT IS MIRRORED ALSO IN YOUR DEAR COUNTENANCES WHO WOULD FILL THE AIR WITH BLESSINGS AND SPEND HIS LIFE IN SERVING YOU HE BIDS YOU WEEP
BUT HERE ALSO I AM CHECKED I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NO ENEMY ON EARTH AND NONE SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO WICKED AS TO DESTROY ME WANTONLY DID THE MURDERER PLACE IT THERE I KNOW OF NO OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED HIM FOR SO DOING
AND WHEN ONE INQUIRED WHERE SHE HAD PASSED THE NIGHT SHE REPLIED THAT SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THE CHILD AND DEMANDED EARNESTLY IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN HEARD CONCERNING HIM WHEN SHOWN THE BODY SHE FELL INTO VIOLENT HYSTERICS AND KEPT HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS
NIGHT ALSO CLOSED AROUND AND WHEN I COULD HARDLY SEE THE DARK MOUNTAINS I FELT STILL MORE GLOOMILY THE PICTURE APPEARED A VAST AND DIM SCENE OF EVIL AND I FORESAW OBSCURELY THAT I WAS DESTINED TO BECOME THE MOST WRETCHED OF HUMAN BEINGS
SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED WHO HAD KNOWN HER FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY SPOKE WELL OF HER BUT FEAR AND HATRED OF THE CRIME OF WHICH THEY SUPPOSED HER GUILTY RENDERED THEM TIMOROUS AND UNWILLING TO COME FORWARD
HORROR AND MISERY WERE STRONGLY EXPRESSED SOMETIMES SHE STRUGGLED WITH HER TEARS BUT WHEN SHE WAS DESIRED TO PLEAD SHE COLLECTED HER POWERS AND SPOKE IN AN AUDIBLE
SHE THEN RELATED THAT BY THE PERMISSION OF ELIZABETH SHE HAD PASSED THE EVENING OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AT THE HOUSE OF AN AUNT AT CHENE
AND MAKE OTHERS SO AND ON THE MORROW JUSTINE DIED ELIZABETH'S HEART RENDING ELOQUENCE FAILED TO MOVE THE JUDGES FROM THEIR SETTLED CONVICTION IN THE CRIMINALITY OF THE SAINTLY SUFFERER
WHEN ELIZABETH CONJECTURED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE HE WAS NOT THERE WE RETURNED AGAIN WITH TORCHES FOR I COULD NOT REST WHEN I THOUGHT THAT MY SWEET BOY HAD LOST HIMSELF AND WAS EXPOSED TO ALL THE DAMPS AND DEWS OF NIGHT
WHO COULD ATTEMPT TO PURSUE HIM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE ONE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO OVERTAKE THE WINDS OR CONFINE A MOUNTAIN STREAM WITH A STRAW
I REST MY INNOCENCE ON A PLAIN AND SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF THE FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDUCED AGAINST ME AND I HOPE THE CHARACTER I HAVE ALWAYS BORNE WILL INCLINE MY JUDGES TO A FAVOURABLE INTERPRETATION WHERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE APPEARS DOUBTFUL OR SUSPICIOUS
THE MORNING ON WHICH THE MURDER OF POOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN DISCOVERED JUSTINE HAD BEEN TAKEN ILL AND CONFINED TO HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS DURING THIS INTERVAL ONE OF THE SERVANTS HAPPENING TO EXAMINE THE APPAREL SHE HAD WORN ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER
BESIDES THE STRANGE NATURE OF THE ANIMAL WOULD ELUDE ALL PURSUIT EVEN IF I WERE SO FAR CREDITED AS TO PERSUADE MY RELATIVES TO COMMENCE IT AND THEN OF WHAT USE WOULD BE PURSUIT WHO COULD ARREST A CREATURE CAPABLE OF SCALING THE OVERHANGING SIDES OF MONT SALEVE
CHAPTER EIGHT WE PASSED A FEW SAD HOURS UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TO COMMENCE MY FATHER AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY BEING OBLIGED TO ATTEND AS WITNESSES I ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE COURT
CLERVAL WHO HAD WATCHED MY COUNTENANCE AS I READ THIS LETTER WAS SURPRISED TO OBSERVE THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEEDED THE JOY I AT FIRST EXPRESSED ON RECEIVING NEW FROM MY FRIENDS
TO SHED COUNTLESS TEARS HAPPY BEYOND HIS HOPES IF THUS INEXORABLE FATE BE SATISFIED AND IF THE DESTRUCTION PAUSE BEFORE THE PEACE OF THE GRAVE HAVE SUCCEEDED TO YOUR SAD TORMENTS
ALAS SAID SHE HOW SHALL I EVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN HUMAN GOODNESS JUSTINE WHOM I LOVED AND ESTEEMED AS MY SISTER HOW COULD SHE PUT ON THOSE SMILES OF INNOCENCE ONLY TO BETRAY HER MILD EYES SEEMED INCAPABLE OF ANY SEVERITY OR GUILE
THE PICTURE WAS THEN PRODUCED WHICH THE SERVANT HAD FOUND IN HER POCKET AND WHEN ELIZABETH IN A FALTERING VOICE PROVED THAT IT WAS THE SAME WHICH AN HOUR BEFORE THE CHILD HAD BEEN MISSED SHE HAD PLACED ROUND HIS NECK
YES SAID ELIZABETH I WILL GO ALTHOUGH SHE IS GUILTY AND YOU VICTOR SHALL ACCOMPANY ME I CANNOT GO ALONE THE IDEA OF THIS VISIT WAS TORTURE TO ME YET I COULD NOT REFUSE
AND AFTER WE HAD EXCHANGED OUR MOURNFUL GREETING WOULD HAVE INTRODUCED SOME OTHER TOPIC THAN THAT OF OUR DISASTER HAD NOT ERNEST EXCLAIMED GOOD GOD PAPA
ALL WAS THE WORK OF MY THRICE ACCURSED HANDS YE WEEP UNHAPPY ONES BUT THESE ARE NOT YOUR LAST TEARS AGAIN SHALL YOU RAISE THE FUNERAL WAIL AND THE SOUND OF YOUR LAMENTATIONS SHALL AGAIN AND AGAIN BE HEARD FRANKENSTEIN
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN FOR ANOTHER FLASH DISCOVERED HIM TO ME HANGING AMONG THE ROCKS OF THE NEARLY PERPENDICULAR ASCENT
SIX YEARS HAD ELAPSED PASSED IN A DREAM BUT FOR ONE INDELIBLE TRACE AND I STOOD IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE I HAD LAST EMBRACED MY FATHER BEFORE MY DEPARTURE FOR INGOLSTADT BELOVED AND VENERABLE PARENT
I HURRIED INTO A CABRIOLET AND BADE FAREWELL TO MY FRIEND MY JOURNEY WAS VERY MELANCHOLY AT FIRST I WISHED TO HURRY ON FOR I LONGED TO CONSOLE AND SYMPATHISE WITH MY LOVED AND SORROWING FRIENDS BUT WHEN I DREW NEAR MY NATIVE TOWN
FORGIVE ME FOR HAVING FOR ONE MOMENT DISTRUSTED YOU WHY DID YOU CONFESS BUT DO NOT MOURN DEAR GIRL DO NOT FEAR I WILL PROCLAIM I WILL PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE I WILL MELT THE STONY HEARTS OF YOUR ENEMIES
THE OTHER FAR MORE DREADFULLY MURDERED WITH EVERY AGGRAVATION OF INFAMY THAT COULD MAKE THE MURDER MEMORABLE IN HORROR JUSTINE ALSO WAS A GIRL OF MERIT AND POSSESSED QUALITIES WHICH PROMISED TO RENDER HER LIFE HAPPY NOW
I WAS NOT SO MISERABLE AS I AM NOW AND DO YOU ALSO BELIEVE THAT I AM SO VERY VERY WICKED DO YOU ALSO JOIN WITH MY ENEMIES TO CRUSH ME TO CONDEMN ME AS A MURDERER HER VOICE WAS SUFFOCATED WITH SOBS
AS A MURDERESS FROM THE TORTURES OF MY OWN HEART I TURNED TO CONTEMPLATE THE DEEP AND VOICELESS GRIEF OF MY ELIZABETH THIS ALSO WAS MY DOING AND MY FATHER'S WOE AND THE DESOLATION OF THAT LATE SO SMILING HOME
THE MURDERER OF MY BROTHER NO SOONER DID THAT IDEA CROSS MY IMAGINATION THAN I BECAME CONVINCED OF ITS TRUTH MY TEETH CHATTERED AND I WAS FORCED TO LEAN AGAINST A TREE FOR SUPPORT THE FIGURE PASSED ME QUICKLY AND I LOST IT IN THE GLOOM
I ENQUIRED MORE MINUTELY CONCERNING MY FATHER
IN THESE LAST MOMENTS I FEEL THE SINCEREST GRATITUDE TOWARDS THOSE WHO THINK OF ME WITH KINDNESS HOW SWEET IS THE AFFECTION OF OTHERS TO SUCH A WRETCH AS I AM IT REMOVES MORE THAN HALF MY MISFORTUNE
I BORE A HELL WITHIN ME WHICH NOTHING COULD EXTINGUISH WE STAYED SEVERAL HOURS WITH JUSTINE AND IT WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT ELIZABETH COULD TEAR HERSELF AWAY I WISH CRIED SHE THAT I WERE TO DIE WITH YOU
I FEAR MY FRIEND THAT I SHALL RENDER MYSELF TEDIOUS BY DWELLING ON THESE PRELIMINARY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY WERE DAYS OF COMPARATIVE HAPPINESS AND I THINK OF THEM WITH PLEASURE MY COUNTRY MY BELOVED COUNTRY
HENCE A FIXED UP JOSH CONDUCTOR
OF THESE LITTLE FACTS AND FELT JUSTLY PROUD WHEN THE DESPATCHES OF A BATTLE RETURNED THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS AT TEN FOLD THE QUANTITY OF PROJECTILES EXPENDED ONE DAY HOWEVER SAD AND MELANCHOLY DAY PEACE WAS SIGNED BETWEEN THE SURVIVORS OF THE WAR
BUT THAT THEY EXHIBITED UNHEARD OF DIMENSIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY ATTAINED HITHERTO UNHEARD OF RANGES IN POINT OF GRAZING PLUNGING OBLIQUE OR ENFILADING OR POINT BLANK FIRING THE ENGLISH

FRENCH AND PRUSSIANS HAVE NOTHING TO LEARN BUT THEIR CANNON HOWITZERS AND MORTARS ARE MERE POCKET PISTOLS
TO ATTEND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRESENT INVITATION VERY CORDIALLY IMPEY BARBICANE
IT WOULD BE BUT JUST AND FAIR RETURNED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY
IT IS BUT FAIR TO ADD THAT THESE YANKEES BRAVE AS THEY HAVE EVER PROVED THEMSELVES TO BE DID NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THEORIES AND FORMULAE BUT THAT THEY PAID HEAVILY IN PROPRIA PERSONA FOR THEIR INVENTIONS AMONG THEM
CONTRACTED IN A PENNSYLVANIA BLAST FURNACE
CIVILIZATION AN UPWARD GROWTH OR TENDENCY THAT HAS ENABLED MANKIND TO DEVELOP THE COLLEGE YELL FROM WHAT WAS ONCE ONLY A FEEBLE WAR WHOOP COLLECTOR A MAN WHOM FEW CARE TO SEE BUT MANY ASK TO CALL AGAIN COLLEGE
HANG A FEW OF OUR COUNTRYMEN NO SUCH LUCK REPLIED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY NOTHING OF THE KIND IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN AND EVEN IF IT DID WE SHOULD NOT PROFIT BY IT AMERICAN SUSCEPTIBILITY IS FAST DECLINING AND WE ARE ALL GOING TO THE DOGS
AFTER A PERIOD OF YEARS FULL OF INCIDENTS WE HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON OUR LABORS AND TO STOP SHORT ON THE ROAD OF PROGRESS I DO NOT HESITATE TO STATE BALDLY THAT ANY WAR WHICH WOULD RECALL US TO ARMS WOULD BE WELCOME TREMENDOUS APPLAUSE

ANTECEDENTS OF THE GUN CLUB AND IT CANNOT FAIL TO MAKE SOME NOISE IN THE WORLD A THRILL OF EXCITEMENT RAN THROUGH THE MEETING BARBICANE HAVING BY A RAPID MOVEMENT FIRMLY FIXED HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD CALMLY CONTINUED HIS HARANGUE
IT WAS DELIGHTFUL ONCE UPON A TIME ONE INVENTED A GUN AND HARDLY WAS IT CAST WHEN ONE HASTENED TO TRY IT IN THE FACE OF THE ENEMY THEN ONE RETURNED TO CAMP WITH A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT FROM SHERMAN OR A FRIENDLY SHAKE OF THE HAND FROM MC CLELLAN BUT NOW THE GENERALS ARE GONE BACK TO THEIR COUNTERS

WERE REDUCED TO SILENCE BY THIS DISASTROUS PEACE AND GAVE THEMSELVES UP WHOLLY TO DREAMS OF A PLATONIC KIND OF ARTILLERY THIS IS HORRIBLE SAID TOM HUNTER ONE EVENING WHILE RAPIDLY CARBONIZING HIS WOODEN LEGS IN THE FIREPLACE OF THE SMOKING ROOM
AND SHUN TO AVOID TO AVOID DIFFICULTY BUY IT OF THE DRUGGIST COMMENDATION
THERE ON THOSE VAST PLAINS THEY WERE TO DESCRIBE ENORMOUS GEOMETRIC FIGURES DRAWN IN CHARACTERS OF REFLECTING LUMINOSITY AMONG WHICH WAS THE PROPOSITION REGARDING THE SQUARE OF THE HYPOTHENUSE COMMONLY CALLED THE ASS'S BRIDGE BY THE FRENCH
THERE IS NO BOND IN EXISTENCE BETWEEN THE EARTH AND HER SATELLITE IT IS RESERVED FOR THE PRACTICAL GENIUS OF AMERICANS TO ESTABLISH A COMMUNICATION
BAH GROWLED BILSBY BETWEEN THE FOUR TEETH WHICH THE WAR HAD LEFT HIM THAT WILL NEVER DO BY JOVE CRIED J T MASTON HE MUSTN'T COUNT ON MY VOTE AT THE NEXT ELECTION NOR ON OURS REPLIED UNANIMOUSLY ALL THE BELLICOSE INVALIDS
AUDACITY AND SANG FROID AT THIS MOMENT HE WAS SITTING IN HIS ARMCHAIR SILENT ABSORBED LOST IN REFLECTION SHELTERED UNDER HIS HIGH CROWNED HAT A KIND OF BLACK CYLINDER WHICH ALWAYS SEEMS FIRMLY SCREWED UPON THE HEAD OF AN AMERICAN
THE FUTURE OF GUNNERY IN AMERICA IS LOST AY AND NO WAR IN PROSPECT CONTINUED THE FAMOUS JAMES T MASTON SCRATCHING WITH HIS STEEL HOOK HIS GUTTA PERCHA CRANIUM NOT A CLOUD ON THE HORIZON AND THAT TOO
ONE WHO COMMANDS THE COIN CONSCIENCE THE FEAR OF BEING FOUND OUT COOK A CHARITABLE INSTITUTION PROVIDING FOOD AND SHELTER FOR POLICEMEN CORPS
EVERY INTELLIGENT BEING SAID THE GEOMETRICIAN MUST UNDERSTAND THE SCIENTIFIC MEANING OF THAT FIGURE THE SELENITES DO THEY EXIST
WERE TO BE COUNTED OFFICERS OF ALL RANKS FROM LIEUTENANTS TO GENERALS MILITARY MEN OF EVERY AGE FROM THOSE WHO WERE JUST MAKING THEIR DEBUT IN THE PROFESSION OF ARMS UP TO THOSE WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN THE GUN CARRIAGE MANY HAD FOUND
AND THEIR PROJECTILES EXCEEDING THE PRESCRIBED LIMITS UNFORTUNATELY OCCASIONALLY CUT IN TWO SOME UNOFFENDING PEDESTRIANS THESE INVENTIONS IN FACT LEFT FAR IN THE REAR THE TIMID INSTRUMENTS OF EUROPEAN ARTILLERY
ALL EAGER TO LEARN THE NATURE OF THE IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION OF PRESIDENT BARBICANE ALL PUSHING SQUEEZING CRUSHING WITH THAT PERFECT FREEDOM OF ACTION WHICH IS SO PECULIAR TO THE MASSES WHEN EDUCATED IN IDEAS OF SELF GOVERNMENT
CYRANO DE BERGERAC PUBLISHED THAT CELEBRATED
AT THE FURTHER END OF THE SALOON THE PRESIDENT ASSISTED BY FOUR SECRETARIES OCCUPIED A LARGE PLATFORM HIS CHAIR SUPPORTED BY A CARVED GUN CARRIAGE WAS MODELED UPON THE PONDEROUS PROPORTIONS OF A THIRTY TWO INCH MORTAR
CROW A BIRD THAT NEVER COMPLAINS WITHOUT CAWS CULTURE A DEGREE OF MENTAL DEVELOPMENT THAT PRODUCES TAILOR MADE WOMEN FANTASTICALLY SHEARED POODLES AND DOCK TAILED HORSES CUPID A DRIVER OF SHARP DARTS CUPIDITY
A FEMININE VIRTUE AND A MASCULINE VICE CREMATION A MEANS OF DISPOSING OF THE DEAD LIKELY TO BECOME VERY POPULAR ESPECIALLY WITH WOMEN WHO ARE SO FOND OF HAVING THE LAST RETORT CRITIC A WET BLANKET THAT SOAKS EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES CROOK
THIS FACT NEED SURPRISE NO ONE THE YANKEES THE FIRST MECHANICIANS IN THE WORLD ARE ENGINEERS JUST AS THE ITALIANS ARE MUSICIANS AND THE GERMANS METAPHYSICIANS BY RIGHT OF BIRTH NOTHING IS MORE NATURAL
BARBICANE HAD MADE A LARGE FORTUNE AS A TIMBER MERCHANT BEING NOMINATED DIRECTOR OF ARTILLERY DURING THE WAR
ALL HIS LIMBS COMPLETE HIS STRONGLY MARKED FEATURES SEEMED DRAWN BY SQUARE AND RULE AND IF IT BE TRUE THAT IN ORDER TO JUDGE A MAN'S CHARACTER ONE MUST LOOK AT HIS PROFILE BARBICANE SO EXAMINED EXHIBITED THE MOST CERTAIN INDICATIONS OF ENERGY
NOTHING TO DO NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT A LOATHSOME EXISTENCE WHEN AGAIN SHALL THE GUNS AROUSE US IN THE MORNING WITH THEIR DELIGHTFUL REPORTS
GUNS WERE COMPELLED TO BOW BEFORE THEIR TRANSATLANTIC RIVALS NOW WHEN AN AMERICAN HAS AN IDEA HE DIRECTLY SEEKS A SECOND AMERICAN TO SHARE IT
THE NEWSPAPERS GREW MOULDY ON THE TABLES SOUNDS OF SNORING CAME FROM DARK CORNERS AND THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB
FROM THAT DAY FORWARD IMPEY BARBICANE BECAME ONE OF THE GREATEST CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES A KIND OF WASHINGTON OF SCIENCE A SINGLE TRAIT OF FEELING TAKEN FROM MANY OTHERS WILL SERVE TO SHOW THE POINT WHICH THIS HOMAGE OF A WHOLE PEOPLE
AND CORPS FOUND IN ARMS CORSET
IT SPREAD EQUALLY AMONG ALL CLASSES OF CITIZENS MEN OF SCIENCE SHOPKEEPERS MERCHANTS PORTERS CHAIR MEN AS WELL AS GREENHORNS WERE STIRRED IN THEIR INNERMOST FIBRES A NATIONAL ENTERPRISE WAS AT STAKE THE WHOLE CITY
CADDIE A SMALL BOY EMPLOYED AT A LIBERAL STIPEND TO LOSE BALLS FOR OTHERS AND FIND THEM FOR HIMSELF CAFE
ONE MIGHT SAY ALL THE WORLD WAS ON THE RAMPARTS THE PRESIDENT WAS SUFFICIENTLY WELL KNOWN HOWEVER FOR ALL TO BE ASSURED THAT HE WOULD NOT PUT HIS COLLEAGUES TO DISCOMFORT WITHOUT SOME VERY STRONG MOTIVE IMPEY BARBICANE WAS A MAN OF FORTY YEARS OF AGE
OF THAT MYSTERIOUS ORB AND SOME EVEN SEEMED TO FEAR LEST ITS CONQUEST SHOULD NOT SENSIBLY DERANGE THE EQUILIBRIUM OF EUROPE THE PROJECT ONCE UNDER DISCUSSION NOT A SINGLE PARAGRAPH SUGGESTED A DOUBT OF ITS REALIZATION
WHICH THE AMERICAN LANGUAGE IS CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING IT WAS A SCENE OF INDESCRIBABLE CONFUSION AND UPROAR THEY SHOUTED THEY CLAPPED THEY STAMPED ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL ALL THE WEAPONS IN THE MUSEUM DISCHARGED AT ONCE
SAID BARBICANE THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I CALL PURELY PAPER ONES
EVERY ONE MUST SEE THAT THAT INVOLVED THE COMMENCEMENT OF A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS ALL MUST HOPE THAT SOME DAY AMERICA
SHOPKEEPERS AND MECHANICS SIMPLE TRADESMEN JUMPED THEIR COUNTERS TO BECOME EXTEMPORIZED CAPTAINS COLONELS AND GENERALS WITHOUT HAVING EVER PASSED THE SCHOOL OF INSTRUCTION AT WEST POINT NEVERTHELESS
THE INVENTOR OF A NEW CANNON ASSOCIATED HIMSELF WITH THE CASTER AND THE BORER THUS WAS FORMED THE NUCLEUS OF THE GUN CLUB IN A SINGLE MONTH AFTER ITS FORMATION IT NUMBERED ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THREE EFFECTIVE MEMBERS
CHAPTER THREE EFFECT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMUNICATION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY THE LAST WORDS OF THE HONORABLE PRESIDENT THE CRIES THE SHOUTS THE SUCCESSION OF ROARS HURRAHS AND ALL THE VARIED VOCIFERATIONS
THE CITY MAGNATES MUNICIPAL COUNCILORS AND SELECT MEN
CALLED HER BY ALL KINDS OF ENDEARING NAMES BETWEEN EIGHT O'CLOCK AND MIDNIGHT ONE OPTICIAN IN JONES' FALL STREET MADE HIS FORTUNE BY THE SALE OF OPERA GLASSES MIDNIGHT ARRIVED AND THE ENTHUSIASM SHOWED NO SIGNS OF DIMINUTION
ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION RESIDENT IN BALTIMORE ATTENDED THE INVITATION OF THEIR PRESIDENT AS REGARDS THE CORRESPONDING MEMBERS NOTICES WERE DELIVERED BY HUNDREDS THROUGHOUT THE STREETS OF THE CITY AND LARGE AS WAS THE GREAT HALL
THE ONE PLACE WHERE PRINCES AND PAUPERS PORTERS AND PRESIDENTS ARE FINALLY ON THE DEAD LEVEL CHAMPAGNE THE STUFF THAT MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND CHAIR FOUR LEGGED AID TO THE INJURED CHARITY FOREHANDED AID TO THE INDIGENT
AFTER THIS CONVERSATION EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION RECEIVED A SEALED CIRCULAR COUCHED IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS BALTIMORE OCTOBER THIRD THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB HAS THE HONOR TO INFORM HIS COLLEAGUES
THEY ELECT A PRESIDENT AND TWO SECRETARIES GIVEN FOUR THEY NAME A KEEPER OF RECORDS AND THE OFFICE IS READY FOR WORK FIVE THEY CONVENE A GENERAL MEETING AND THE CLUB IS FULLY CONSTITUTED SO THINGS WERE MANAGED IN BALTIMORE
PERHAPS HE WAS DESIROUS OF ADDRESSING A FEW MORE WORDS TO HIS COLLEAGUES FOR BY HIS GESTURES HE DEMANDED SILENCE AND HIS POWERFUL ALARUM WAS WORN OUT BY ITS VIOLENT REPORTS NO ATTENTION HOWEVER WAS PAID TO HIS REQUEST
BY WHICH AT ITS FIRST TRIAL HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN KILLING THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE FACT REPLIED HE STILL WHAT IS THE USE OF SO MANY STUDIES WORKED OUT SO MANY DIFFICULTIES VANQUISHED IT'S MERE WASTE OF TIME
NO TRUE YANKEE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED EVEN THE SEMBLANCE OF A DIFFICULTY TO BE POSSIBLE A THING WITH THEM IS NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE THE TRIUMPHAL PROGRESS OF THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE EVENING IT WAS A REGULAR TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION
NEVERTHELESS THE VAST HALL PRESENTED A CURIOUS SPECTACLE ITS IMMENSE AREA WAS SINGULARLY ADAPTED TO THE PURPOSE LOFTY PILLARS FORMED OF CANNON SUPERPOSED UPON HUGE MORTARS AS A BASE SUPPORTED THE FINE IRONWORK OF THE ARCHES
THE EXCITEMENT BEGAN TO SUBSIDE PRESIDENT BARBICANE REACHED HIS HOUSE BRUISED CRUSHED AND SQUEEZED ALMOST TO A MUMMY HERCULES COULD NOT HAVE RESISTED A SIMILAR OUTBREAK OF ENTHUSIASM THE CROWD GRADUALLY DESERTED THE SQUARES AND STREETS
MEANWHILE REPLIED J T MASTON ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT IF I CANNOT GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY MY NEW MORTARS ON A REAL FIELD OF BATTLE I SHALL SAY GOOD BY TO THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB AND GO AND BURY MYSELF IN THE PRAIRIES OF ARKANSAS
THE MEANS OF ARRIVING THITHER ARE SIMPLE EASY CERTAIN INFALLIBLE AND THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF MY PRESENT PROPOSAL A STORM OF ACCLAMATIONS GREETED THESE WORDS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE WHOLE AUDIENCE WHO WAS NOT OVERCOME CARRIED AWAY
LIFTED OUT OF HIMSELF BY THE SPEAKER'S WORDS LONG CONTINUED APPLAUSE RESOUNDED FROM ALL SIDES AS SOON AS THE EXCITEMENT HAD PARTIALLY SUBSIDED BARBICANE RESUMED HIS SPEECH IN A SOMEWHAT GRAVER VOICE YOU KNOW SAID HE
WHAT PROGRESS ARTILLERY SCIENCE HAS MADE DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WHAT A DEGREE OF PERFECTION FIREARMS OF EVERY KIND HAVE REACHED MOREOVER YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT IN GENERAL TERMS
A MAN WHO IS SMART ENOUGH TO OPERATE AN AUTOMOBILE BUT CLEVER ENOUGH NOT TO OWN ONE CHRISTIAN A MEMBER OF ANY ORTHODOX CHURCH CHRISTMAS A WIDELY OBSERVED HOLIDAY ON WHICH THE PAST NOR THE FUTURE IS OF SO MUCH INTEREST AS THE PRESENT
THEY DEBATED WHETHER THE MOON WAS A FINISHED WORLD OR WHETHER IT WAS DESTINED TO UNDERGO ANY FURTHER TRANSFORMATION DID IT RESEMBLE THE EARTH AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE LATTER WAS DESTITUTE AS YET OF AN ATMOSPHERE WHAT KIND OF SPECTACLE WOULD ITS HIDDEN HEMISPHERE PRESENT TO OUR TERRESTRIAL SPHEROID
SELENOGRAPHIC CHARTS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH A PERFECTION WHICH EQUALS IF IT DOES NOT EVEN SURPASS THAT OF OUR TERRESTRIAL MAPS PHOTOGRAPHY HAS GIVEN US PROOFS OF THE INCOMPARABLE BEAUTY OF OUR SATELLITE ALL IS KNOWN REGARDING THE MOON
SEE KERNEL COMPLIMENT
BUT THE POINT IN WHICH THE AMERICANS SINGULARLY DISTANCED THE EUROPEANS WAS IN THE SCIENCE OF GUNNERY NOT INDEED THAT THEIR WEAPONS RETAINED A HIGHER DEGREE OF PERFECTION THAN THEIRS
THE NEW WORLD SEEMS TO HAVE MADE UP ITS MIND TO LIVE IN PEACE AND OUR BELLICOSE TRIBUNE PREDICTS SOME APPROACHING CATASTROPHES ARISING OUT OF THIS SCANDALOUS INCREASE OF POPULATION NEVERTHELESS REPLIED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY
TOGETHER WITH GRIEF AND THE GUN CLUB WAS RELEGATED TO PROFOUND INACTIVITY SOME FEW OF THE MORE ADVANCED AND INVETERATE THEORISTS SET THEMSELVES AGAIN TO WORK UPON CALCULATIONS REGARDING THE LAWS OF PROJECTILES THEY REVERTED INVARIABLY
THEIR REST ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE WHOSE NAMES FIGURED IN THE BOOK OF HONOR OF THE GUN CLUB AND OF THOSE WHO MADE GOOD THEIR RETURN THE GREATER PROPORTION BORE THE MARKS OF THEIR INDISPUTABLE VALOR CRUTCHES WOODEN LEGS ARTIFICIAL ARMS
AS THOUGH SHE COMPREHENDED ALL THIS AGITATION REGARDING HERSELF THE MOON SHONE FORTH WITH SERENE SPLENDOR ECLIPSING BY HER INTENSE ILLUMINATION ALL THE SURROUNDING LIGHTS THE YANKEES ALL TURNED THEIR GAZE TOWARD HER RESPLENDENT ORB KISSED THEIR HANDS
AND THE IMPLACABLE ENEMY OF THE GENTLEMEN OF THE SOUTH THOSE ANCIENT CAVALIERS OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY
TO TAKE OFF CARTOON THE TAKE OFF CAULIFLOWER A CABBAGE WITH A COLLEGE EDUCATION CAVALRY THAT ARM OF THE MILITARY SERVICE THAT ENGAGES IN THE REAL HOSS TILITIES CEMETERY
NO IS IT POSSIBLE REPLIED TOM HUNTER
HIGH AND LOW THE QUAYS BORDERING THE PATAPSCO THE SHIPS LYING IN THE BASINS DISGORGED A CROWD DRUNK WITH JOY GIN AND WHISKY EVERY ONE CHATTERED ARGUED DISCUSSED DISPUTED APPLAUDED
DON'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET TRY AN INCUBATOR CAB AFFAIR FOR A DRIVE CABBY DRIVER FOR A FARE
HE EMBRACED THE LITTLE PRINCE OF WALES AND MADE THE QUEEN SEAT HERSELF IN THE ROYAL STATE COACH ON THE RIGHT HAND THE CAVALCADE THEN TURNED TOWARDS SAINT GERMAINS
IT WOULD DIE ON THE DOORSTEP OF APPARENT BEREAVEMENT NEVER MORE TO APPEAR WITHIN DILWORTH CASTLE UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES THEY KNEW WELL THAT THE GNAWING JAWS OF POVERTY WHICH FOR YEARS HAD FAILED TO EXPOSE THEIR GRINDING POWER
ONLY SEVEN DAYS AND THIS BEAUTIFUL BOUDOIR SHALL OWN ME NO MORE WITH ITS WALLS OF PUREST WHITE AND GILDED BORDERS JUST SEVEN DAYS AND I SHALL BE FETTERED WITH CHAINS OF DRAGGING DISLIKE AND DISAPPOINTMENT
THERE LEAVES A SCAR OF INDELIBLE INTOLERANCE UNTIL WIPED OUT FOR EVER WITH THE CURATIVE BALSAM OF BATTLED FREEDOM SIR JOHN AND IRENE MET IN DILWORTH CASTLE FOR THE LAST TIME ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY OF AUGUST
THEIR OPINION OF MARY WAS FAVOURABLE THEY FOUND HER PERSON AGREEABLE AND HER DEPORTMENT DIGNIFIED THEY RESPECTED HER COURAGE AND HER MATERNAL AFFECTION AND THEY PITIED HER ILL FORTUNE
BUT YET AGAIN HE FOUND HIMSELF SNUG IN BED TWENTY TIMES HE TRIED AND TWENTY TIMES HE FAILED FOR IN FACT HE WAS NOT AWAKE ONLY DREAMING THAT HE WAS AT LENGTH IN AN AGONY OF DESPAIR
AND SITTING DOWN TO THE RIGHT OF HER UPON WHOM SHE HAD THAT DAY FLUNG IN THE FACE OF DEVOTION THE LAST DREGS OF DEFIANCE BEGGED TO OFFER AN APOLOGY FOR SUCH UNRULY CONDUCT AND ADDED
WILLIAM TALKED TO THEM WITH A FRANKNESS AND AN EFFUSION OF HEART WHICH SELDOM APPEARED IN HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH ENGLISHMEN HIS FIRST WORDS WERE WELL AND WHAT DO OUR FRIENDS AT HOME SAY NOW IN TRUTH
THE COBS'LL BE CARRYING OFF THE PRINCESS FROM UNDER THEIR STUPID NOSES BUT THEY SHAN'T THAT THEY SHAN'T HE JUMPED UP AS HE THOUGHT AND BEGAN TO DRESS BUT TO HIS DISMAY FOUND THAT HE WAS STILL LYING IN BED NOW THEN I WILL
CURDIE WITH THE POINT OF HIS HUNTING KNIFE KEEPING HER FROM CLASPING HER MIGHTY ARMS ABOUT HIM AS HE WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING ONCE MORE A GOOD STAMP AT HER SKIN SHOD FOOT BUT THE QUEEN WAS MORE WARY AS WELL AS MORE AGILE THAN HITHERTO
THE BISHOP OF BARELEGS AND CANON FOOT WITH HIGHLY IMPRESSED AND OPEN FALSEHOOD AS THAT PRACTISED BY HER IN THE ABSENCE OF LABOURING UNDER SUCH A SOLEMN VOW WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE BREATHLESS SURPRISE
HE CAME DOWN WITH ALL THE WEIGHT OF HIS IRON SHOD SHOE UPON HER SKIN SHOD FOOT AND WITH A HIDEOUS HOWL SHE DROPPED HIM SQUATTED ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK HER FOOT IN BOTH HER HANDS MEANWHILE THE REST RUSHED ON THE KING AND THE BODYGUARD SENT THEM FLYING
WAS THE WHISPERED ECHO THROUGHOUT THE DISTINGUISHED GUESTS WHO SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST AFTER THE JUNCTION OF OPPOSITES YEA THIS WAS A REMARK OF TRUTH VISIBLY
FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE EXPEDITION SAILED THE ANXIETY OF THE WHOLE DUTCH NATION HAD BEEN INTENSE NEVER HAD THERE BEEN SUCH CROWDS IN THE CHURCHES NEVER HAD THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PREACHERS BEEN SO ARDENT
AND NOW CURDIE APPROACHED THE GROUP WHICH IN TRUSTING IN THE QUEEN AND HER SHOE KEPT THEIR GUARD OVER THE PROSTRATE CAPTAIN
BUT SPARINGLY DURING THE CEREMONY ALL OF WHICH WERE MOSTLY ACCEPTED COSTLY MULTIPLYING AND VARIED WERE THE GIFTS RECEIVED BY IRENE ENOUGH TO MAKE A PRINCESS STARE WITH STARTLING BEWILDERMENT
THE INHABITANTS OF THE HAGUE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM INSULTING ALBEVILLE HIS HOUSE WAS SO CLOSELY BESET BY THE POPULACE DAY AND NIGHT
IRENE WAS AROUSED BY THE RINGING OF THE BREAKFAST BELL BEFORE SHE GOT TIME TO FINISH THE SENTENCE THAT TROUBLED HER WEARY BRAIN FOR MONTHS BEFORE DRESSING HERSELF WITH FRANTIC EXPERTNESS SHE DASHED DOWN THE WINDING STAIRCASE
AND SAW IN THE FARTHEST CORNER A TERRIFIED GROUP OF THE DOMESTICS UNWATCHED BUT COWERING WITHOUT COURAGE TO ATTEMPT THEIR ESCAPE AMONGST THEM WAS THE TERROR STRICKEN FACE OF LOOTIE BUT NOWHERE COULD HE SEE THE PRINCESS
IT WAS A MORNING NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN BY LORD AND LADY DILWORTH WHO ON THAT DAY WOULD BE ROBBED OF THE TREASURE HELD FIRM AND FAST BY THEM FOR THE LENGTHENED PERIOD OF NINE YEARS AND WHICH THEY YIELDED UP WITH HEARTS OF SORROW
WAS NOW PUNCTILIOUS INDEED BUT PUNCTILIOUS FOR HIS UNFORTUNATE FRIENDS AGAINST HIMSELF HE GAVE ORDERS THAT MARY SHOULD RECEIVE ALL THE MARKS OF RESPECT THAT HAD EVER BEEN PAID TO HIS OWN DECEASED WIFE
THE ONLY APPLAUSE BY WHICH HIS STOICAL NATURE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN STRONGLY MOVED WAS THE APPLAUSE OF HIS DEAR NATIVE COUNTRY OF HIS IMMENSE POPULARITY IN ENGLAND HE SPOKE WITH COLD DISDAIN
TAKEN ON HIMSELF THE EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATION A GENERAL CRY OF PRIDE AND JOY ROSE FROM ALL THE DUTCH FACTIONS AN EXTRAORDINARY MISSION WAS WITH GREAT SPEED DESPATCHED TO CONGRATULATE HIM
AWAY SCATTERED THE GOBLINS IN EVERY DIRECTION INTO CLOSETS UP STAIRS INTO CHIMNEYS UP ON RAFTERS AND DOWN TO THE CELLARS CURDIE WENT ON STAMPING AND SLASHING AND SINGING BUT SAW NOTHING OF THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE
OR HER MADDENED DESIRE TO BECOME THE WIFE OF A POOR TUTOR HAD SHE ONLY TAKEN INTO HER CONFIDENCE HER WHOSE WISE COUNSEL AND MOTHERLY EXAMPLE WERE AT ALL TIMES A PROMPT STEP TO DECISION
BEFORE HIS GORGEOUS COACH WENT THE SWISS HALBERDIERS ON EACH SIDE OF IT AND BEHIND IT RODE THE BODY GUARDS WITH CYMBALS CLASHING AND TRUMPETS PEALING
AFTER THE IMPORTANT CEREMONY WAS PERFORMED AND THE REGISTER SIGNED SIR JOHN AND LADY DUNFERN WHEN THE USUAL CONGRATULATIONS WERE ENDED
HE FOUND THE BEDCLOTHES TOSSED ABOUT AND MOST OF THEM ON THE FLOOR WHILE THE PRINCESS'S GARMENTS WERE SCATTERED ALL OVER THE ROOM WHICH WAS IN THE GREATEST CONFUSION IT WAS ONLY TOO EVIDENT THAT THE GOBLINS HAD BEEN THERE
SUMPTUOUS FURNITURE HAD BEEN HASTILY SENT IN THE NURSERY OF THE PRINCE OF WALES HAD BEEN CAREFULLY FURNISHED WITH EVERYTHING THAT AN INFANT COULD REQUIRE ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS PRESENTED TO THE QUEEN THE KEY OF A SUPERB CASKET WHICH STOOD IN HER APARTMENT
OR HAD SHE ONLY HINTED TO LADY DILWORTH HER MANIFEST INABILITY TO RETURN SIR JOHN'S GREAT AFFECTION MATTERS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE REACHED ANOTHER CLIMAX BUT OWING TO THE PRESENT PRECARIOUS POSITION IN WHICH LORD AND LADY DILWORTH STOOD
BUT THE SAME MOMENT IN RUSHED THE CAPTAIN AND HIS MEN AND RAN AT THEM STAMPING FURIOUSLY THEY DARED NOT ENCOUNTER SUCH AN ONSET AWAY THEY SCURRIED THE QUEEN FOREMOST OF COURSE
HERE IS A GENTLEMAN SAID LEWIS TO MARY WHOM YOU WILL BE GLAD TO SEE THEN AFTER ENTREATING HIS GUESTS TO VISIT HIM NEXT DAY AT VERSAILLES AND TO LET HIM HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING THEM HIS BUILDINGS PICTURES AND PLANTATIONS
CURDIE MADE ONE STAB AT HIM AS HE DISAPPEARED CAUGHT HOLD OF THE SENSELESS LOOTIE AND HAVING DRAGGED HER BACK TO THE CORNER THERE MOUNTED GUARD OVER HER PREPARING ONCE MORE TO ENCOUNTER THE QUEEN
WOULD THERE BE ANY MEANS OF FLIGHT FROM THE DANGEROUS DRAGON THAT HAUNTS ME NIGHT AND DAY COULD ANYTHING POSSIBLE BE DONE TO SAVE MYSELF FROM FALSE ALLIANCE TOO LATE TOO LATE
HARELIP RUSHED AT THEM CAUGHT UP LOOTIE AND SPED WITH HER TO THE HOLE SHE GAVE A GREAT SHRIEK AND CURDIE HEARD HER AND SAW THE PLIGHT SHE WAS IN GATHERING ALL HIS STRENGTH HE GAVE THE QUEEN A SUDDEN CUT ACROSS THE FACE WITH HIS WEAPON
WHICH SOUNDED VICTORIOUS THE COBS WERE IN THE HOUSE HE SPRANG FROM HIS BED HURRIED ON SOME OF HIS CLOTHES NOT FORGETTING HIS SHOES WHICH WERE ARMED WITH NAILS THEN SPYING AN OLD HUNTING KNIFE OR SHORT SWORD HANGING ON THE WALL HE CAUGHT IT
AS SOON AS THE NEWS THAT THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND WAS ON THE FRENCH COAST HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO VERSAILLES A PALACE WAS PREPARED FOR HER RECEPTION CARRIAGES AND TROOPS OF GUARDS WERE DESPATCHED TO AWAIT HER ORDERS
JAMES WAS AT HER RIGHT HAND LEWIS MODESTLY PLACED HIMSELF ON THE LEFT NAY HE WAS WELL PLEASED THAT IN HIS OWN PALACE AN OUTCAST LIVING ON HIS BOUNTY SHOULD ASSUME THE TITLE OF KING OF FRANCE
OF LADY DILWORTH CHIEFLY AND THOSE PRESENT ALSO WHO ONLY THE EVENING PREVIOUS HAD BEEN POURING SUCH PRAISES OVER THE MAGNIFICENT DUCHESSE SATIN GOWN
THE RIGHT THING WOULD HAVE BEEN TO TAKE THE KING AND QUEEN PRISONERS AND HOLD THEM HOSTAGES FOR THE PRINCESS BUT THEY WERE SO ANXIOUS TO FIND HER THAT NO ONE THOUGHT OF DETAINING THEM UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE HAVING THUS RESCUED THE SERVANTS THEY SET ABOUT SEARCHING THE HOUSE ONCE MORE
THE SETTING MOON WAS THROWING A FEEBLE LIGHT THROUGH THE CASEMENT AND THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF UPROAR THERE WAS SOFT HEAVY MULTITUDINOUS STAMPING A CLASHING AND CLANGING OF WEAPONS THE VOICES OF MEN AND THE CRIES OF WOMEN MIXED WITH A HIDEOUS BELLOWING
AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE HALL WAS NEARLY EMPTY THE GOBLINS RUNNING FROM IT AS FAST AS THEY COULD HOWLING AND SHRIEKING AND LIMPING AND COWERING EVERY NOW AND THEN AS THEY RAN TO CUDDLE THEIR WOUNDED FEET IN THEIR HARD HANDS OR TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE FRIGHTFUL STAMP STAMP OF THE ARMED MEN
AND LIFTED THE PROSTRATE CAPTAIN WHO WAS ALL BUT PRESSED TO DEATH IT WAS SOME MOMENTS BEFORE HE RECOVERED BREATH AND CONSCIOUSNESS WHERE'S THE PRINCESS CRIED CURDIE AGAIN AND AGAIN NO ONE KNEW AND OFF THEY ALL RUSHED IN SEARCH OF HER
AND NEVER BETTER EXEMPLIFIED THAN IN THE PRESENT EXISTING STATE OF AFFAIRS
AT SAINT GERMAINS ON THE VERGE OF A FOREST SWARMING WITH BEASTS OF CHASE AND ON THE BROW OF A HILL WHICH LOOKS DOWN ON THE WINDINGS OF THE SEINE FRANCIS THE FIRST HAD BUILT A CASTLE AND HENRY THE FOURTH HAD CONSTRUCTED A NOBLE TERRACE
CURDIE BURST IN DANCING AND GYRATING AND STAMPING AND SINGING LIKE A SMALL INCARNATE WHIRLWIND
AND STILL MORE OUT OF HUMOUR WITH ITS NATURAL CHIEF
THE GOBLINS IN THE KING'S HOUSE WHEN CURDIE FELL ASLEEP HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO DREAM HE THOUGHT HE WAS ASCENDING THE MOUNTAINSIDE FROM THE MOUTH OF THE MINE
THROUGH EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE THEY WENT BUT NOWHERE WAS SHE TO BE FOUND NEITHER WAS ONE OF THE SERVANTS TO BE SEEN BUT CURDIE WHO HAD KEPT TO THE LOWER PART OF THE HOUSE WHICH WAS NOW QUIET ENOUGH BEGAN TO HEAR A CONFUSED SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUBBUB
HAD REACHED THE LAST AND ONLY BITE OF SUDDEN TERMINATION AND THEREBY STAMPED THEIR MARKS OF MELANCHOLY SO IMPRESSIVELY UPON THE NOBLE BROWS OF THE WORTHY OWNERS OF DILWORTH CASTLE THAT TIME COULD NEVER BLOT THEM FROM OBSERVATION
EMBLEMS OF THE APPROACHING FESTIVITY DID NOT FAIL TO APPEAR ON THE HOUSETOPS OF THE HUMBLEST VILLAGE PEASANT GLADNESS REIGNED THROUGHOUT THE HOUSEHOLD AND ALL HEARTS SAVE TWO REJOICED WITH UNABATED ACTIVITY
SHE OPENED THE CASKET AND FOUND IN IT SIX THOUSAND PISTOLES ON THE FOLLOWING DAY JAMES ARRIVED AT SAINT GERMAINS LEWIS WAS ALREADY THERE TO WELCOME HIM
SUCH TRIFLES WERE SERIOUS MATTERS AT THE OLD COURT OF FRANCE THERE WERE PRECEDENTS ON BOTH SIDES BUT LEWIS DECIDED THE POINT AGAINST HIS OWN BLOOD SOME LADIES OF ILLUSTRIOUS RANK OMITTED THE CEREMONY OF KISSING THE HEM OF MARY'S ROBE
HE WHO HAD HITHERTO ON ALL QUESTIONS OF PRECEDENCE BEEN SENSITIVE LITIGIOUS INSOLENT WHO HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONCE READY TO PLUNGE EUROPE INTO WAR RATHER THAN CONCEDE THE MOST FRIVOLOUS POINT OF ETIQUETTE
BUT JAMES THEY REGARDED WITH EXTREME CONTEMPT THEY WERE DISGUSTED BY HIS INSENSIBILITY BY THE COOL WAY IN WHICH HE TALKED TO EVERY BODY OF HIS RUIN AND BY THE CHILDISH PLEASURE WHICH HE TOOK IN THE POMP AND LUXURY OF VERSAILLES
SOON HOWEVER THE MAGNIFICENT KING CONCEIVED AN INEXPLICABLE DISGUST FOR HIS BIRTHPLACE HE QUITTED SAINT GERMAINS FOR VERSAILLES AND EXPENDED SUMS ALMOST FABULOUS IN THE VAIN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A PARADISE
BETTER LEAVE HER TO THE FREEDOM OF A WILL THAT ERE LONG WOULD SINK THE SHIP OF OPULENCE IN THE SEA OF PENURY AND WRING FROM HER THE WORDS LEAVE ME NOW DECEPTIVE DEMON OF DELUDED MOCKERY
THE GOBLINS WOULD HAVE TORN THEM ALL TO PIECES BUT THE KING HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO CARRY THEM AWAY ALIVE AND OVER EACH OF THEM IN TWELVE GROUPS WAS STANDING A KNOT OF GOBLINS WHILE AS MANY AS COULD FIND ROOM WERE SITTING UPON THEIR PROSTRATE BODIES
DID SHE IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT SHE TO WHOM SHE OWED ANYTHING BUT DISOBEDIENCE EVEN IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM SHOULD BE WRESTED FROM HER ARMS OF COMPANIONSHIP ERE HER RETURN TO DUNFERN MANSION
HE RUSHED AMONGST THEM SHOUTING ONE TWO HIT AND HEW THREE FOUR BLAST AND BORE AND WITH EVERY RHYME HE CAME DOWN A GREAT STAMP UPON A FOOT CUTTING AT THE SAME TIME THEIR FACES EXECUTING INDEED A SWORD DANCE OF THE WILDEST DESCRIPTION
CAME THE MOST SPLENDID ARISTOCRACY OF EUROPE ALL FEATHERS RIBANDS JEWELS AND EMBROIDERY BEFORE THE PROCESSION HAD GONE FAR IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT MARY WAS APPROACHING LEWIS ALIGHTED AND ADVANCED ON FOOT TO MEET HER
AND ASKING WHY IT APPEARED AT THIS GAY TIME WAS ANSWERED EVASIVELY INDEED LORD AND LADY DILWORTH WERE WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS
HARELIP WITH ANOTHER COMPANY HAD GONE OFF TO SEARCH THE HOUSE THEY CAPTURED EVERY ONE THEY MET AND WHEN THEY COULD FIND NO MORE THEY HURRIED AWAY TO CARRY THEM SAFE TO THE CAVERNS BELOW BUT WHEN THE BUTLER WHO WAS AMONGST THEM FOUND THAT THEIR PATH LAY THROUGH THE WINE CELLAR
THE INTENSE EXCITEMENT THAT FOR WEEKS BEFORE HAD FOUND SUCH REFUGE WITHIN THEIR CHERISHED AND MUCH LOVED HOME
SHOULD AS KING OF FRANCE QUARTER THE LILIES WITH THE ENGLISH LIONS AND SHOULD AS KING OF FRANCE DRESS IN VIOLET ON DAYS OF COURT MOURNING THE DEMEANOUR OF THE FRENCH NOBILITY ON PUBLIC OCCASIONS
WHEN HE CAME UPON A WOMAN AND CHILD WHO HAD LOST THEIR WAY AND FROM THAT POINT HE WENT ON DREAMING EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM SINCE HE THUS MET THE PRINCESS AND LOOTIE HOW HE HAD WATCHED THE GOBLINS HOW HE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THEM
HER BELOVED BENEFACTORS WHO HAD BEEN THE PRIME MOVERS IN THE MATTER OF MATRIMONY SAW PLAINLY A SADDENED LOOK ABOUT THE LOVELY FACE
ARRAYED IN AN IRISH POPLIN OF THE DARKEST VISIBLE SHADE OF GREEN WITHOUT EITHER TRAIN OR FLOWER OF DISTINCTION NOT EVEN A SPECK OF RIBBON OR BORDER OF LACE AND NO ORNAMENT ONLY THE VALUED NECKLET WHICH GRACED HER PEARLY THROAT
HAD NOT THE TUITIONAL CLICK OF BYGONE ATTACHMENT KEPT MOVING WITH MEASURED PACE UNTIL STOPPED AFTER MONTHS OR IT MAY BE SMALL YEARS OF CONSTANT SWINGING
BUT THAT MANY MORE GOBLIN FEET HAD TO GO LIMPING BACK OVER THE UNDERGROUND WAYS OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT MORNING PRESENTLY HOWEVER THEY WERE REINFORCED FROM ABOVE BY THE KING AND HIS PARTY WITH THE REDOUBTABLE QUEEN AT THEIR HEAD
EITHER IN TIME OF REJOICING OR SORROWING PREPARATIONS WERE AT LAST ALMOST COMPLETED FOR SUCH AN AUSPICIOUS EVENT INVITATIONS WERE ISSUED NUMEROUSLY FOR THE RECEPTION TO BE HELD AT DILWORTH CASTLE AFTER IRENE'S MARRIAGE
BUT THE QUEEN STOOD IN FRONT LIKE AN INFURIATED CAT WITH HER PERPENDICULAR EYES GLEAMING GREEN AND HER HAIR STANDING HALF UP FROM HER HORRID HEAD HER HEART WAS QUAKING HOWEVER AND SHE KEPT MOVING ABOUT HER SKIN SHOD FOOT WITH NERVOUS APPREHENSION
DID LADY DUNFERN EVER DREAM THAT HER APOLOGY FOR DISOBEDIENCE TO LADY DILWORTH'S ORDERS IN NOT ARRAYING HERSELF IN THE GARB OF GLISTENING GLORY COULD EVER BE ACCEPTED EVEN BY THE KIND AND LOVING LADY DILWORTH
FOR HE HAD SOON FOUND THEIR HEADS ALL BUT INVULNERABLE THE QUEEN HAD ATTACKED HIS LEGS AND FEET WITH HER HORRIBLE GRANITE SHOE AND HE WAS SOON DOWN BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD GOT HIS BACK TO THE WALL AND STOOD OUT LONGER
ON A SPOT SINGULARLY STERILE AND UNWHOLESOME ALL SAND OR MUD WITHOUT WOOD WITHOUT WATER AND WITHOUT GAME SAINT GERMAINS HAD NOW BEEN SELECTED TO BE THE ABODE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY OF ENGLAND
WHO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVING TO ALL EUROPE
AS BEFORE STATED FEW WERE THOSE INVITED TO BE PRESENT AT THE WEDDING CEREMONY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK NOON SIR JOHN ARRIVED AT THE CASTLE SHORTLY BEFORE THAT TIME LOOKING CHARMING INDEED
AND MASTERED THOROUGHLY THE EXPOSURE OF THE PAINFUL AGONY THROUGH WHICH SHE WAS PASSING KNOWING AS SHE DID AND FULLY BELIEVED THAT ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS
HER FACE STREAMING WITH BLOOD AND HER EYES FLASHING GREEN LIGHTNING THROUGH IT SHE CAME ON WITH HER MOUTH OPEN AND HER TEETH GRINNING LIKE A TIGER'S FOLLOWED BY THE KING AND HER BODYGUARD OF THE THICKEST GOBLINS
LEWIS REMARKED THE OMISSION AND NOTICED IT IN SUCH A VOICE AND WITH SUCH A LOOK THAT THE WHOLE PEERAGE WAS EVER AFTER READY TO KISS HER SHOE WHEN ESTHER JUST WRITTEN BY RACINE WAS ACTED AT SAINT CYR MARY HAD THE SEAT OF HONOUR
YEA ACUTELY FROM THE BLOW STRUCK HIM ON THE EVE OF ASPIRATION AND ACHIEVEMENT LOVE ALAS WHEN SMITTEN WITH THE SWORD OF INDIFFERENCE DIETH SOON BUT ONCE STRUCK ON THE TUNNELLED CHEEK OF SECRECY WITH THE HAND OF PITY
WAS MUCH LESS RARE AND ADMIRABLE THAN THE EXQUISITE DELICACY WITH WHICH HE LABOURED TO SOOTHE THE FEELINGS OF HIS GUESTS AND TO LIGHTEN THE ALMOST INTOLERABLE WEIGHT OF THE OBLIGATIONS WHICH HE LAID UPON THEM
THE UNFORTUNATE EXILE BOWED SO LOW THAT IT SEEMED AS IF HE WAS ABOUT TO EMBRACE THE KNEES OF HIS PROTECTOR LEWIS RAISED HIM AND EMBRACED HIM WITH BROTHERLY TENDERNESS THE TWO KINGS THEN ENTERED THE QUEEN'S ROOM
THE NOISE GREW AS HIS SHARP EARS GUIDED HIM TO A STAIR AND SO TO THE WINE CELLAR IT WAS FULL OF GOBLINS WHOM THE BUTLER WAS SUPPLYING WITH WINE AS FAST AS HE COULD DRAW IT WHILE THE QUEEN AND HER PARTY HAD ENCOUNTERED THE MEN AT ARMS
CAME DOWN AS SHE STARTED BACK WITH ALL HIS WEIGHT ON THE PROPER FOOT AND SPRUNG TO LOOTIE'S RESCUE THE PRINCE HAD TWO DEFENCELESS FEET AND ON BOTH OF THEM CURDIE STAMPED JUST AS HE REACHED THE HOLE HE DROPPED HIS BURDEN AND ROLLED SHRIEKING INTO THE EARTH
AND ELECTED WITHOUT ANY CONTEST FOUR GREAT MERCHANTS WHO WERE ZEALOUS WHIGS THE KING AND HIS ADHERENTS HAD HOPED THAT MANY RETURNING OFFICERS WOULD TREAT THE PRINCE'S LETTER AS A NULLITY BUT THE HOPE WAS DISAPPOINTED
THE IMPOSTURY OF POSITION IS PETTY AND ENDS AS IT SHOULD COMMENCE WITH STIRRING STRIFE
TOOK THE DRESSING FROM HIS LEG RUBBED IT WITH SOMETHING THAT SMELT LIKE ROSES AND THEN WAVED HER HANDS OVER HIM THREE TIMES AT THE LAST WAVE OF HER HANDS EVERYTHING VANISHED HE FELT HIMSELF SINKING INTO THE PROFOUNDEST SLUMBER
SHE WAS RECONCILED THAT NEITHER THE MARRIAGE ROBE OF PURITY
AND TOO SELDOM TERMINATES VICTORIOUSLY GREAT MERCY ONLY ANOTHER WEEK AND I SHALL ALMOST CEASE TO BE A FREE THINKER JUST SEVEN DAYS MORE AND WHAT I SHALL OPENLY HAVE TO CONFESS TO THE WORLD AN UNTRUTH
WHERE EXCEPT A DISMAYED GOBLIN LURKING HERE AND THERE THEY FOUND NO ONE WHILE HE REQUESTED LOOTIE TO TAKE HIM TO THE PRINCESS'S ROOM
GOOD PROTESTANTS WHOM NO EXERTIONS MUST BE SPARED TO CARRY IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING AND OF THE LORD LIEUTENANT AND THESE CANDIDATES WERE NOW GENERALLY RETURNED WITHOUT OPPOSITION THE PRINCE GAVE STRICT ORDERS
IN WHICH WERE VESSELS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION FROM SAUCE PAN TO SILVER CUP PRESSING AROUND THE BUTLER WHO SAT AT THE TAP OF A HUGE CASK FILLING AND FILLING CURDIE CAST ONE GLANCE AROUND THE PLACE BEFORE COMMENCING HIS ATTACK
OF THE RESIDENCES OF THE FRENCH KINGS NONE STOOD IN A MORE SALUBRIOUS AIR OR COMMANDED A FAIRER PROSPECT THE HUGE SIZE AND VENERABLE AGE OF THE TREES THE BEAUTY OF THE GARDENS THE ABUNDANCE OF THE SPRINGS WERE WIDELY FAMED
SHE BROKE FORTH INTO PASSIONATE EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE MADAM SAID HER HOST IT IS BUT A MELANCHOLY SERVICE THAT I AM RENDERING YOU TO DAY I HOPE THAT I MAY BE ABLE HEREAFTER TO RENDER YOU SERVICES GREATER AND MORE PLEASING
WAS ABSOLUTELY REGULATED BY THEIR SOVEREIGN BUT IT WAS BEYOND EVEN HIS POWER TO PREVENT THEM FROM THINKING FREELY AND FROM EXPRESSING WHAT THEY THOUGHT IN PRIVATE CIRCLES WITH THE KEEN AND DELICATE WIT CHARACTERISTIC OF THEIR NATION AND OF THEIR ORDER
NONE OF THEM COULD GIVE THE LEAST INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PRINCESS LOOTIE WAS ALMOST SILLY WITH TERROR AND ALTHOUGH SCARCELY ABLE TO WALK WOULD NOT LEAVE CURDIE'S SIDE FOR A SINGLE MOMENT AGAIN HE ALLOWED THE OTHERS TO SEARCH THE REST OF THE HOUSE
FANCYING HE HEARD THE GOBLINS ALL OVER THE HOUSE HE GAVE A GREAT CRY THEN THERE CAME AS HE THOUGHT A HAND UPON THE LOCK OF HIS DOOR IT OPENED AND LOOKING UP HE SAW A LADY WITH WHITE HAIR CARRYING A SILVER BOX IN HER HAND ENTER THE ROOM
TO BESTOW UPON HER HIS CHOICE COLLECTION OF LOVE'S PUREST FRAGRANCE WHICH SHOULD CAST THE SWEETEST SCENT OF MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP THROUGHOUT THE DAZZLING APARTMENTS OF THE MANSION SHE WAS ABOUT TO GRACE
THIS STRANGE APATHY THEY ATTRIBUTED NOT TO PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION BUT TO STUPIDITY AND MEANNESS OF SPIRIT
SOME CONSTITUENT BODIES HAD UNDER THOSE WRITS ACTUALLY PROCEEDED TO THE CHOICE OF REPRESENTATIVES THERE WAS SCARCELY A COUNTY IN WHICH THE GENTRY AND YEOMANRY HAD NOT MANY MONTHS BEFORE FIXED UPON CANDIDATES
STAMP ON THEIR FEET STAMP ON THEIR FEET HE SHOUTED AND IN A MOMENT THE GOBLINS WERE DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FLOOR LIKE RATS AND MICE THEY COULD NOT VANISH SO FAST HOWEVER
LURK NO MORE AROUND THE VALE OF VANITY LIKE A VINDICTIVE VIPER STRIKE THE LYRE OF LIVING DECEPTION TO THE STRAINS OF DULL DEADNESS DESPAIR AND DOUBT
THUS WERE JOINED TWO HEARTS OF WIDELY DIFFERENT BEAT ONE OF INTENSE LOVE WHICH HEARSAY NEVER COULD SHAKE THE OTHER OF DIRE DISLIKE WHICH REASON COULD NEVER ALTER BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR
WHEN CURDIE WAS WITHIN A FEW PACES SHE RUSHED AT HIM MADE ONE TREMENDOUS STAMP AT HIS OPPOSING FOOT WHICH HAPPILY HE WITHDREW IN TIME AND CAUGHT HIM ROUND THE WAIST TO DASH HIM ON THE MARBLE FLOOR BUT JUST AS SHE CAUGHT HIM
FINDING CURDIE AGAIN BUSY AMONGST HER UNFORTUNATE SUBJECTS SHE RUSHED AT HIM ONCE MORE WITH THE RAGE OF DESPAIR AND THIS TIME GAVE HIM A BAD BRUISE ON THE FOOT THEN A REGULAR STAMPING FIGHT GOT UP BETWEEN THEM
THE REST MEANTIME FINDING THEIR ADVERSARY THUS MATCHED FOR THE MOMENT PAUSED IN THEIR HEADLONG HURRY AND TURNED TO THE SHIVERING GROUP OF WOMEN IN THE CORNER AS IF DETERMINED TO EMULATE HIS FATHER AND HAVE A SUN WOMAN OF SOME SORT TO SHARE HIS FUTURE THRONE
PERSONS OF HIGH RANK WERE INSTANTLY DESPATCHED FROM VERSAILLES TO GREET AND ESCORT HIM MEANWHILE LEWIS ATTENDED BY HIS FAMILY AND HIS NOBILITY WENT FORTH IN STATE TO RECEIVE THE EXILED QUEEN
CHAPTER SIX THE SILVERY TOUCH OF FORTUNE IS TOO OFTEN GILT WITH BETRAYAL THE MEDDLING MOUTH OF EXTRAVAGANCE SWALLOWS EVERY DESIRE AND EATS THE HEART OF HONESTY WITH PICKLED PRIDE
ONLY SEVEN DAYS AND THUS SHALL END MY CHERISHED HOPES MY GIRLISH PRIDE MY MOST ARDENT WISH BUT ALAS NOT MY LOVE SEVEN DAYS MORE SHALL SEE MY OWN DARLING OS SUDDENLY
BEING THE DAY SET APART FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THEIR MARRIAGE IT COMMENCED WITH THE RINGING OF THE VILLAGE BELLS THE SUN SHONE FORTH IN ALL HIS UNIVERSAL GLORY
HOW HE HAD BEEN RESCUED BY THE PRINCESS EVERYTHING INDEED UNTIL HE WAS WOUNDED CAPTURED AND IMPRISONED BY THE MEN AT ARMS AND NOW HE THOUGHT HE WAS LYING WIDE AWAKE WHERE THEY HAD LAID HIM WHEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD A GREAT THUNDERING SOUND THE COBS ARE COMING
LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH HAD BEEN BORN THERE HAD WHEN A YOUNG MAN HELD HIS COURT THERE HAD ADDED SEVERAL STATELY PAVILIONS TO THE MANSION OF FRANCIS AND HAD COMPLETED THE TERRACE OF HENRY
AND RUSHED DOWN THE STAIRS GUIDED BY THE SOUNDS OF STRIFE WHICH GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER WHEN HE REACHED THE GROUND FLOOR HE FOUND THE WHOLE PLACE SWARMING
AS IT OFTEN APPEARS ON A FINE WINTER DAY IN DISTINCT PLANES OF ILLUMINATION INDEPENDENTLY TONED THE RAYS WHICH LIT THE NEARER TRACTS OF LANDSCAPE
THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HAPPY MEETING IS THERE ANY USE IN SAYING WHAT CAN DO NO GOOD AUNT YES SAID HER AUNT WITH SOME WARMTH TO THOROUGHLY FILL THE AIR WITH THE PAST MISFORTUNE
IN CONFORMITY WITH HER WORDS TO THE REDDLEMAN SHE HAD HOPED TO BE WELL ADVANCED IN HER WALK BEFORE THE HEAT OF THE DAY WAS AT ITS HIGHEST BUT AFTER SETTING OUT SHE FOUND THAT THIS WAS NOT TO BE DONE
AND EVEN STIFF CABBAGES WERE LIMP BY NOON IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ON THIS DAY THAT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT STARTED ACROSS THE HEATH TOWARDS HER SON'S HOUSE TO DO HER BEST IN GETTING RECONCILED WITH HIM AND EUSTACIA
HE'S GOING TO THE SAME PLACE MA'AM SHE FOLLOWED THE FIGURE INDICATED HE APPEARED OF A RUSSET HUE NOT MORE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SCENE AROUND HIM THAN THE GREEN CATERPILLAR FROM THE LEAF IT FEEDS ON
IN THAT DAMNED SURGERY OF THE TRIUMPH SEEING MEN BROUGHT DOWN TO THE COCKPIT WITH THEIR LEGS AND ARMS BLOWN TO JERICHO AND SO THE YOUNG MAN HAS SETTLED IN PARIS MANAGER TO A DIAMOND MERCHANT OR SOME SUCH THING IS HE NOT
TILL THEY WERE DIMINISHED TO AN ISOLATED ONE HERE AND THERE BY THE INCREASING FERTILITY OF THE SOIL
IT IS THE ONLY WAY OUT OF A FALSE POSITION AND A VERY GALLING ONE WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM THAT HE WAS STANDING IN THE WAY OF ANOTHER LOVER OF YOURS AUNT
THEIR FATHERS COULDN'T DO IT AND THE COUNTRY WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR IT NOW I SHOULD THINK CAP'N THAT MISS EUSTACIA HAD ABOUT AS MUCH IN HER HEAD THAT COMES FROM BOOKS AS ANYBODY ABOUT HERE
BUT A MOMENT'S THOUGHT SHOWED HER THAT THE PRESENCE OF AN ACQUAINTANCE WOULD TAKE OFF THE AWKWARDNESS OF HER FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE HOUSE BY CONFINING THE TALK TO GENERAL MATTERS UNTIL SHE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THEM
A SMALL APPLE TREE OF THE SORT CALLED RATHERIPE GREW JUST INSIDE THE GATE THE ONLY ONE WHICH THROVE IN THE GARDEN BY REASON OF THE LIGHTNESS OF THE SOIL AND AMONG THE FALLEN APPLES ON THE GROUND BENEATH
BLOWN DOWN IN THE GALES OF PAST YEARS THE PLACE WAS CALLED THE DEVIL'S BELLOWS AND IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY TO COME THERE ON A MARCH OR NOVEMBER NIGHT TO DISCOVER THE FORCIBLE REASONS FOR THAT NAME
AS TO GET HOME AGAIN SO SHE WENT ON THE AIR AROUND HER PULSATING SILENTLY AND OPPRESSING THE EARTH WITH LASSITUDE SHE LOOKED AT THE SKY OVERHEAD
THE FURZE STACK WAS NOT FAR FROM THE CHIMNEY AND THE VOICES WERE THOSE OF THE WORKERS HER GRANDFATHER JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION
NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER THAN TO SEE THEM TWO MAN AND WIFE THEY'D LOOK VERY NATTY ARM IN CROOK TOGETHER AND THEIR BEST CLOTHES ON WHETHER OR NO
EVEN STRONGER AND MORE ACTIVE THAN HER OWN THE TREES BENEATH WHICH SHE SAT WERE SINGULARLY BATTERED RUDE AND WILD AND FOR A FEW MINUTES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT DISMISSED THOUGHTS OF HER OWN STORM BROKEN
ON ANY INFINITESIMAL MATTER WHICH CAUGHT HER EYES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN TO HER SON'S HOUSE AND ITS EXACT POSITION WAS UNKNOWN TO HER
THUS QUIETLY SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IN THE MORNING THAT HER COLOURLESS INNER WORLD WOULD BEFORE NIGHT BECOME AS ANIMATED AS WATER UNDER A MICROSCOPE AND THAT WITHOUT THE ARRIVAL OF A SINGLE VISITOR
HOW BEST TO MAKE HER VISIT APPEAR TO EUSTACIA NOT ABJECT BUT WISE FROM HER ELEVATED POSITION THE EXHAUSTED WOMAN COULD PERCEIVE THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE BELOW AND THE GARDEN
STRANGERS DON'T SEE YOU AS I DO SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT THEY JUDGE FROM FALSE REPORT WELL IT IS A SILLY JOB AND I AM PARTLY TO BLAME HOW QUICKLY A RASH THING CAN BE DONE
OF A MILE AND A HALF THIS BROUGHT HER TO A SPOT IN WHICH THE GREEN BOTTOM OF THE DALE BEGAN TO WIDEN
TO SEARCH OUT THE BEST AND LARGEST OF THEM FOR THE COMING HOLIDAY TIME THE LOFT WAS LIGHTED BY A SEMICIRCULAR HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE PIGEONS CREPT TO THEIR LODGINGS IN THE SAME HIGH QUARTERS OF THE PREMISES
SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM AND INQUIRED THE WAY THE LABOURER POINTED OUT THE DIRECTION AND ADDED
AT WHICH MYRIADS OF IMPRISONED SHAPES AROSE WHERE HAD PREVIOUSLY APPEARED THE STILLNESS OF A VOID
A STRATUM OF ENSAFFRONED LIGHT WAS IMPOSED ON A STRATUM OF DEEP BLUE AND BEHIND THESE LAY STILL REMOTER SCENES WRAPPED IN FRIGID GREY
EUSTACIA WAS INDOORS IN THE DINING ROOM WHICH WAS REALLY MORE LIKE A KITCHEN HAVING A STONE FLOOR AND A GAPING CHIMNEY CORNER THE AIR WAS STILL AND WHILE SHE LINGERED A MOMENT HERE ALONE
AND NOT THAT OF A PERSON COME ON BUSINESS OR BY INVITATION HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE WITH INTEREST AND THEN WALKED ROUND AND SCANNED THE OUTER BOUNDARY OF THE GARDEN AS ONE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD IT BEEN THE BIRTHPLACE OF SHAKESPEARE
ENTER HIS OWN DOOR AT ONE SIDE OF CLYM'S HOUSE WAS A KNOLL AND ON THE TOP OF THE KNOLL A CLUMP OF FIR TREES SO HIGHLY THRUST UP INTO THE SKY THAT THEIR FOLIAGE FROM A DISTANCE APPEARED
ON THE PRESENT HEATED AFTERNOON WHEN NO PERCEPTIBLE WIND WAS BLOWING THE TREES KEPT UP A PERPETUAL MOAN WHICH ONE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE TO BE CAUSED BY THE AIR
THAT FIVE MINUTES OF OVERHEARING FURNISHED EUSTACIA WITH VISIONS ENOUGH TO FILL THE WHOLE BLANK AFTERNOON SUCH SUDDEN ALTERNATIONS FROM MENTAL VACUITY DO SOMETIMES OCCUR
THEY WERE EVIDENTLY INTENDED FOR FURZE FAGGOT BONDS WHICH HE MEANT TO COLLECT ON HIS RETURN THE SILENT BEING WHO THUS OCCUPIED HIMSELF SEEMED TO BE OF NO MORE ACCOUNT IN LIFE
ONLY AT ODD TIMES BY WAY OF USEFUL PASTIME YET SHE NOW BEHELD HIM AS A FURZE CUTTER AND NOTHING MORE WEARING THE REGULATION DRESS OF THE CRAFT
YOU HAVE TIS NEWS TO ME WHILE THE FURZE GATHERERS HAD DESULTORILY CONVERSED THUS EUSTACIA'S FACE GRADUALLY BENT TO THE HEARTH
WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CHAP TERRIBLE MUCH AFTER SO MANY YEARS
HAD UNDERGONE A SPECIES OF INCINERATION SINCE THE DROUGHT HAD SET IN
WHICH HUMPHREY HAD BEEN CUTTING FOR THE CAPTAIN'S USE DURING THE FOREGOING FINE DAYS THE STACK WAS AT THE END OF THE DWELLING AND THE MEN ENGAGED IN BUILDING IT WERE HUMPHREY AND SAM THE OLD MAN LOOKING ON
BUT THE PRESENT TORRID ATTACK MADE THE JOURNEY A HEAVY UNDERTAKING FOR A WOMAN PAST MIDDLE AGE AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD MILE SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD HIRED FAIRWAY TO DRIVE HER A PORTION AT LEAST OF THE DISTANCE
AT THE TIME THAT EUSTACIA WAS LISTENING TO THE RICK MAKERS CONVERSATION ON CLYM'S RETURN THOMASIN WAS CLIMBING INTO A LOFT OVER HER AUNT'S FUELHOUSE WHERE THE STORE APPLES WERE KEPT
I THINK HE MAY DO IT NOW THAT HE KNOWS SOMETHING I TOLD HIM I DON'T FOR A MOMENT DISPUTE THAT IT IS THE MOST PROPER THING FOR YOU TO MARRY HIM MUCH AS I HAVE OBJECTED TO HIM IN BYGONE DAYS I AGREE WITH YOU NOW YOU MAY BE SURE
AND SAT DOWN UNDER THEIR SHADE TO RECOVER HERSELF AND TO CONSIDER HOW BEST TO BREAK THE GROUND WITH EUSTACIA SO AS NOT TO IRRITATE A WOMAN UNDERNEATH WHOSE APPARENT INDOLENCE LURKED PASSIONS
WERE WASPS ROLLING DRUNK WITH THE JUICE OR CREEPING ABOUT THE LITTLE CAVES IN EACH FRUIT WHICH THEY HAD EATEN OUT BEFORE STUPEFIED BY ITS SWEETNESS BY THE DOOR LAY CLYM'S FURZE HOOK
ALL THAT AFTERNOON THE EXPECTED ARRIVAL OF THE SUBJECT OF EUSTACIA'S RUMINATIONS CREATED A BUSTLE OF PREPARATION AT BLOOMS END THOMASIN HAD BEEN PERSUADED BY HER AUNT
AND HELP CARRY ANYTHING FOR'N THOUGH I SUPPOSE HE'S ALTERED FROM THE BOY HE WAS THEY SAY HE CAN TALK FRENCH AS FAST AS A MAID CAN EAT BLACKBERRIES AND IF SO DEPEND UPON IT WE WHO HAVE STAYED AT HOME
AND THEY TELL ME TIS WHERE THE KING'S HEAD WAS CUT OFF YEARS AGO MY POOR MOTHER USED TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT BUSINESS HUMMY SHE USED TO SAY I WAS A YOUNG MAID THEN
WILL YOU WALK WITH ME TO MEET HIM THIS EVENING I SHOULD LIKE TO ELSE IT WOULD SEEM AS IF I HAD FORGOTTEN HIM SAID THOMASIN TOSSING OUT A BOUGH NOT THAT THAT WOULD MATTER MUCH
IN A PROFOUND REVERIE HER TOE UNCONSCIOUSLY TAPPING THE DRY TURF WHICH LAY BURNING AT HER FEET
SHE SOMETIMES SAT DOWN UNDER HER UMBRELLA TO REST AND TO WATCH THEIR HAPPINESS FOR A CERTAIN HOPEFULNESS AS TO THE RESULT OF HER VISIT GAVE EASE TO HER MIND AND BETWEEN IMPORTANT THOUGHTS LEFT IT FREE TO DWELL
LIT BY A FEW STRAY MOTES OF LIGHT AS SHE STOOD HALFWAY UP THE LADDER LOOKING AT A SPOT INTO WHICH SHE WAS NOT CLIMBER ENOUGH TO VENTURE NOW A FEW RUSSETS TAMSIN
IT WAS A FINE AND QUIET AFTERNOON ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK BUT THE WINTER SOLSTICE HAVING STEALTHILY COME ON THE LOWNESS OF THE SUN CAUSED THE HOUR TO SEEM LATER THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS
HAD BEEN PASSED IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL THE CENTRE AND VORTEX
WHY DON'T PEOPLE JUDGE ME BY MY ACTS NOW LOOK AT ME AS I KNEEL HERE PICKING UP THESE APPLES DO I LOOK LIKE A LOST WOMAN I WISH ALL GOOD WOMEN WERE AS GOOD AS I SHE
YES POOR MAID HER HEART HAS ACHED ENOUGH ABOUT IT HER HEALTH IS SUFFERING FROM IT I HEAR FOR SHE WILL BIDE ENTIRELY INDOORS WE NEVER SEE HER OUT NOW SCAMPERING OVER THE FURZE WITH A FACE AS RED AS A ROSE AS SHE USED TO DO
CERTAIN EPHEMERAL OPERATIONS WERE APT TO DISTURB IN THEIR TRIFLING WAY THE MAJESTIC CALM OF EGDON HEATH THEY WERE ACTIVITIES WHICH BESIDE THOSE OF A TOWN A VILLAGE OR EVEN A FARM
MISSUS YEOBRIGHT STRAINED HER EYES AND AT LAST SAID THAT SHE DID PERCEIVE HIM
SHE TRIED ONE ASCENDING PATH AND ANOTHER AND FOUND THAT THEY LED HER ASTRAY RETRACING HER STEPS SHE CAME AGAIN TO AN OPEN LEVEL WHERE SHE PERCEIVED AT A DISTANCE A MAN AT WORK
THEY'VE CUT THE KING'S HEAD OFF JANE AND WHAT TWILL BE NEXT GOD KNOWS A GOOD MANY OF US KNEW AS WELL AS HE BEFORE LONG SAID THE CAPTAIN CHUCKLING I LIVED SEVEN YEARS UNDER WATER ON ACCOUNT OF IT IN MY BOYHOOD
SAID HER AUNT WHO STOOD AT THE EDGE OF THE PIT
THEY REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE HOLLIES GREW WHICH WAS IN A CONICAL PIT SO THAT THE TOPS OF THE TREES WERE NOT MUCH ABOVE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF THE GROUND THOMASIN STEPPED UP INTO A FORK OF ONE OF THE BUSHES
A WOMAN CAN HARDLY PASS FOR SHAME SOMETIMES
SHE AND CLYM YEOBRIGHT WOULD MAKE A VERY PRETTY PIGEON PAIR HEY IF THEY WOULDN'T I'LL BE DAZED BOTH OF ONE MIND ABOUT NICETIES FOR CERTAIN AND LEARNED IN PRINT
THOMASIN CAME DOWN WHEN THE APPLES WERE COLLECTED AND TOGETHER THEY WENT THROUGH THE WHITE PALINGS TO THE HEATH BEYOND THE OPEN HILLS WERE AIRY AND CLEAR AND THE REMOTE ATMOSPHERE APPEARED
AND SHE DETERMINED THAT HER WALK SHOULD BE IN THE DIRECTION OF BLOOMS END THE BIRTHPLACE OF YOUNG YEOBRIGHT AND THE PRESENT HOME OF HIS MOTHER SHE HAD NO REASON FOR WALKING ELSEWHERE AND
HIS PROGRESS WHEN ACTUALLY WALKING WAS MORE RAPID THAN MISSUS YEOBRIGHT'S BUT SHE WAS ENABLED TO KEEP AT AN EQUABLE DISTANCE FROM HIM BY HIS HABIT OF STOPPING WHENEVER HE CAME TO A BRAKE OF BRAMBLES
TO ANY OTHER PERSON THAN A MOTHER IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED A LITTLE HUMILIATING THAT SHE THE ELDER OF THE TWO WOMEN SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO MAKE ADVANCES BUT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD WELL CONSIDERED ALL THAT AND SHE ONLY THOUGHT
AND EXHAUSTED STATE TO CONTEMPLATE THEIRS NOT A BOUGH IN THE NINE TREES WHICH COMPOSED THE GROUP BUT WAS SPLINTERED LOPPED AND DISTORTED BY THE FIERCE WEATHER THAT THERE HELD THEM AT ITS MERCY
SHE WAS SCARCELY ABLE TO FAMILIARIZE HERSELF WITH THIS STRANGE REALITY SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT CLYM WAS IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING FURZE BUT SHE HAD SUPPOSED THAT HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH THE LABOUR
NOW HEARKEN TO ME SHE SAID HER DELICATE VOICE EXPANDING INTO FIRMNESS BY A FORCE WHICH WAS OTHER THAN PHYSICAL TELL HIM NOTHING
WOULD HAVE APPEARED AS THE FERMENT OF STAGNATION MERELY A CREEPING OF THE FLESH OF SOMNOLENCE BUT HERE AWAY FROM COMPARISONS SHUT IN BY THE STABLE HILLS AMONG WHICH MERE WALKING
AND BE NEITHER DRUNKARD NOR GLUTTON THEY SAY TOO THAT CLYM YEOBRIGHT IS BECOME A REAL PERUSING MAN WITH THE STRANGEST NOTIONS ABOUT THINGS THERE THAT'S BECAUSE HE WENT TO SCHOOL EARLY SUCH AS THE SCHOOL WAS
WHENEVER IT PREVAILED SOME WERE BLASTED AND SPLIT AS IF BY LIGHTNING BLACK STAINS AS FROM FIRE MARKING THEIR SIDES WHILE THE GROUND AT THEIR FEET WAS STREWN WITH DEAD FIR NEEDLES AND HEAPS OF CONES
AND THAT I DID NOT EXPECT HIM HOME SO SOON AND YOU MUST NOT LET ME STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR CHRISTMAS PARTY PUTTING IT OFF WOULD ONLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE OF COURSE I SHALL NOT I DO NOT WISH TO SHOW MYSELF BEATEN BEFORE ALL EGDON
WHICH ADMITTED THE SUNLIGHT SO DIRECTLY UPON HER BROWN HAIR AND TRANSPARENT TISSUES THAT IT ALMOST SEEMED TO SHINE THROUGH HER IF HE COULD HAVE BEEN DEAR TO YOU IN ANOTHER WAY SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FROM THE LADDER
THE EARTH AND EVERY DROP OF WATER THAT WAS TO BE FOUND IN MISSUS YEOBRIGHT'S GARDEN LARGE LEAVED PLANTS OF A TENDER KIND FLAGGED BY TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING RHUBARB BENT DOWNWARD AT ELEVEN
HE USED TO LIKE THEM ALMOST AS WELL AS RIBSTONES THOMASIN TURNED AND ROLLED ASIDE THE FERN FROM ANOTHER NOOK WHERE MORE MELLOW FRUIT GREETED HER WITH ITS RIPE SMELL BEFORE PICKING THEM OUT
THE LEAVES OF THE HOLLYHOCKS HUNG LIKE HALF CLOSED UMBRELLAS THE SAP ALMOST SIMMERED IN THE STEMS AND FOLIAGE WITH A SMOOTH SURFACE GLARED LIKE METALLIC MIRRORS
IT WAS NOW NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE SUNLIGHT WAS LEAVING THE VALES WHEN THE WEST GREW RED THE TWO RELATIVES CAME AGAIN FROM THE HOUSE AND PLUNGED INTO THE HEATH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM THE FIRST
AND THAT YOU ACT A PART TO ME HE WISHED TO MARRY ME
WHEN SHE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF EXTERNALS IT WAS DUSK THE FURZE RICK WAS FINISHED THE MEN HAD GONE HOME EUSTACIA WENT UPSTAIRS THINKING THAT SHE WOULD TAKE A WALK AT THIS HER USUAL TIME
WHICH MARKED THE VERGE OF THE HEATH IN THIS LATITUDE THEY SHOWED UPON THE DUSKY SCENE THAT THEY BORDERED AS DISTINCTLY AS WHITE LACE ON VELVET BEHIND THE WHITE PALINGS WAS A LITTLE GARDEN BEHIND THE GARDEN
AND BY AN INSTINCTIVE IMPULSE OF LOYALTY TOWARDS HER COUSIN CLYM TO BESTIR HERSELF ON HIS ACCOUNT WITH AN ALACRITY UNUSUAL IN HER DURING THESE MOST SORROWFUL DAYS OF HER LIFE
YOU MAY THINK WHAT YOU CHOOSE I HAVE NEVER IMPLIED TO YOU BY WORD OR DEED THAT I HAVE GROWN TO THINK OTHERWISE OF HIM AND I NEVER WILL AND I SHALL MARRY HIM WELL WAIT TILL HE REPEATS HIS OFFER
ON ITS WAY TO THE SQUARE BIT OF SKY AT THE TOP FROM WHICH THE DAYLIGHT STRUCK DOWN WITH A PALLID GLARE UPON THE TATTERS OF SOOT DRAPING THE FLUE AS SEAWEED DRAPES A ROCKY FISSURE SHE REMEMBERED
THERE BEING LITTLE HERE TO REMIND AN INHABITANT THAT HE MUST UNLEARN HIS SUMMER EXPERIENCE OF THE SKY AS A DIAL IN THE COURSE OF MANY DAYS AND WEEKS
REPLIED THE GIRL HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING AND TEARS SO CROWDED THEMSELVES INTO HER EYES THAT SHE COULD HARDLY DISTINGUISH APPLES FROM FERN AS SHE CONTINUED INDUSTRIOUSLY SEARCHING TO HIDE HER WEAKNESS
WHY SHOULD SHE NOT GO THAT WAY THE SCENE OF THE DAYDREAM IS SUFFICIENT FOR A PILGRIMAGE AT NINETEEN TO LOOK AT THE PALINGS BEFORE THE YEOBRIGHTS HOUSE HAD THE DIGNITY OF A NECESSARY PERFORMANCE
SOUNDS OF VOICES IN CONVERSATION CAME TO HER EARS DIRECTLY DOWN THE CHIMNEY SHE ENTERED THE RECESS AND LISTENING LOOKED UP THE OLD IRREGULAR SHAFT WITH ITS CAVERNOUS HOLLOWS WHERE THE SMOKE BLUNDERED ABOUT
SHE CAME DOWN THE HILL TO THE GATE AND LOOKED INTO THE HOT GARDEN THERE LAY THE CAT ASLEEP ON THE BARE GRAVEL OF THE PATH AS IF BEDS RUGS AND CARPETS WERE UNENDURABLE
AND SET THE SURROUNDING RABBITS CURIOUSLY WATCHING FROM HILLOCKS AT A SAFE DISTANCE THE PERFORMANCE WAS THAT OF BRINGING TOGETHER AND BUILDING INTO A STACK THE FURZE FAGGOTS
HAD THE NOVELTY OF PAGEANTRY AND WHERE ANY MAN COULD IMAGINE HIMSELF TO BE ADAM WITHOUT THE LEAST DIFFICULTY THEY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF EVERY BIRD WITHIN EYESHOT EVERY REPTILE NOT YET ASLEEP
A YOUNG AND CLEVER MAN WAS COMING INTO THAT LONELY HEATH FROM OF ALL CONTRASTING PLACES IN THE WORLD PARIS
SAID THOMASIN WITH ROUND EYES WHAT DO YOU MEAN DON'T BE ALARMED IT WAS MY DUTY
IS THE VERY THING THAT WILL HINDER THE TALE FROM REACHING HIM EARLY IF I AM NOT MADE SAFE FROM SNEERS IN A WEEK OR TWO I WILL TELL HIM MYSELF THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH THOMASIN SPOKE PREVENTED FURTHER OBJECTIONS
SUDDENLY SHE WAS ATTRACTED TO HIS INDIVIDUALITY BY OBSERVING PECULIARITIES IN HIS WALK IT WAS A GAIT SHE HAD SEEN SOMEWHERE BEFORE AND THE GAIT REVEALED THE MAN TO HER AS THE GAIT OF AHIMAAZ IN THE DISTANT PLAIN
AN OLD IRREGULAR THATCHED HOUSE FACING THE HEATH AND COMMANDING A FULL VIEW OF THE VALLEY THIS WAS THE OBSCURE REMOVED SPOT TO WHICH WAS ABOUT TO RETURN A MAN WHOSE LATTER LIFE
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THESE NEW MOVES IN FAMILIES MY FATHER WAS A SAILOR SO WAS I AND SO SHOULD MY SON HAVE BEEN IF I HAD HAD ONE THE PLACE HE'S BEEN LIVING AT IS PARIS SAID HUMPHREY
BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF IT HE MUST SOON KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED A MERE LOOK AT YOUR FACE WILL SHOW HIM THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG THOMASIN TURNED AND REGARDED HER AUNT FROM THE TREE
SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE WHAT A CLASS TO BELONG TO DO I REALLY BELONG TO THEM TIS ABSURD YET WHY AUNT DOES EVERYBODY KEEP ON MAKING ME THINK THAT I DO BY THE WAY THEY BEHAVE TOWARDS ME
ONE TIDINGS OF THE COMER
WAS USED ON EGDON IN PACKING AWAY STORES OF ALL KINDS THE PIGEONS WERE FLYING ABOUT HER HEAD WITH THE GREATEST UNCONCERN AND THE FACE OF HER AUNT WAS JUST VISIBLE ABOVE THE FLOOR OF THE LOFT
AND THE WHOLE ENCLOSURE OF THE LITTLE DOMICILE AND NOW AT THE MOMENT OF RISING SHE SAW A SECOND MAN APPROACHING THE GATE HIS MANNER WAS PECULIAR HESITATING
SUNRISE HAD ADVANCED ITS QUARTERS FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHEAST SUNSET HAD RECEDED FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHWEST BUT EGDON HAD HARDLY HEEDED THE CHANGE
WHEN CRACKS APPEARED IN CLAYEY GARDENS AND WERE CALLED EARTHQUAKES BY APPREHENSIVE CHILDREN WHEN LOOSE SPOKES WERE DISCOVERED IN THE WHEELS OF CARTS AND CARRIAGES AND WHEN STINGING INSECTS HAUNTED THE AIR
EVEN THE PURPLE HEATH FLOWERS HAVING PUT ON A BROWNNESS UNDER THE DRY BLAZES OF THE FEW PRECEDING DAYS EVERY VALLEY WAS FILLED WITH AIR LIKE THAT OF A KILN
THE PRISON OF MARY STUART OR THE CHATEAU OF HOUGOMONT AFTER PASSING ROUND AND AGAIN REACHING THE GATE HE WENT IN
CLYM'S FAMILY IS AS GOOD AS HERS
HER AUNT SIMPLY SAID VERY WELL HE SHOULD BY RIGHTS HAVE BEEN TOLD AT THE TIME THAT THE WEDDING WAS GOING TO BE HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR YOUR SECRECY YES HE WILL WHEN HE KNOWS IT WAS BECAUSE I WISHED TO SPARE HIM
AS A MOTH FRETS A GARMENT ENTIRELY ENGROSSED WITH ITS PRODUCTS HAVING NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BUT FERN FURZE HEATH LICHENS AND MOSS
SHALL SEEM NO MORE THAN SCROFF IN HIS EYES
HERE SHE SAT FOR TWENTY MINUTES OR MORE ERE SHE COULD SUMMON RESOLUTION TO GO DOWN TO THE DOOR HER COURAGE BEING LOWERED TO ZERO BY HER PHYSICAL LASSITUDE
SHE STOPPED A MOMENT DEAR CLYM I WONDER HOW YOUR FACE LOOKS NOW SHE SAID GAZING ABSTRACTEDLY AT THE PIGEON HOLE
YES SIR THAT'S IT TIS A BLAZING GREAT BUSINESS THAT HE BELONGS TO SO I'VE HEARD HIS MOTHER SAY
THAT WEAK GIRL HOW IS SHE GOING TO GET A MAN TO MARRY HER WHEN SHE CHOOSES BUT LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING AUNT
AUNT SHE SAID PRESENTLY I HAVE I THINK A RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION YES YOU HAVE
AS A BLACK SPOT IN THE AIR ABOVE THE CROWN OF THE HILL ON REACHING THIS PLACE MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FELT DISTRESSINGLY AGITATED WEARY AND UNWELL SHE ASCENDED

TO SO PRACTISED AND INDEFATIGABLE A HORSEMAN AS MISTER ROCHESTER IT WOULD BE BUT A MORNING'S RIDE I BEGAN TO CHERISH HOPES I HAD NO RIGHT TO CONCEIVE
IT WOULD BE PAST THE POWER OF MAGIC SIR AND IN THOUGHT I ADDED A LOVING EYE IS ALL THE CHARM NEEDED TO SUCH YOU ARE HANDSOME ENOUGH
AND WHETHER SHE WON'T LOOK LIKE QUEEN BOADICEA LEANING BACK AGAINST THOSE PURPLE CUSHIONS I WISH JANE I WERE A TRIFLE BETTER ADAPTED TO MATCH WITH HER EXTERNALLY
THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE PARTED FAR OR SOON BUT WHEN AS WE THUS SAT MISTER ROCHESTER ENTERED UNANNOUNCED AND LOOKING AT US
BITTERNUTT LODGE CONNAUGHT IRELAND YOU'LL LIKE IRELAND I THINK THEY'RE SUCH WARM HEARTED PEOPLE THERE THEY SAY IT IS A LONG WAY OFF SIR
EVEN SINGLY OUR WAVE GIRT LAND
HANDBREADTH I KNEW I MIGHT BE WATCHED THENCE SO I WENT APART INTO THE ORCHARD
ITS SOLE SEPARATION FROM LONELY FIELDS A WINDING WALK BORDERED WITH LAURELS AND TERMINATING IN A GIANT HORSE CHESTNUT CIRCLED AT THE BASE BY A SEAT LED DOWN TO THE FENCE HERE ONE COULD WANDER UNSEEN
MISSUS FAIRFAX SURMISED
HILLO HE CRIES AND HE PUTS UP HIS BOOK AND HIS PENCIL THERE YOU ARE COME ON IF YOU PLEASE I SUPPOSE I DO COME ON
YET A MONTH ELAPSED BEFORE I QUITTED GATESHEAD I WISHED TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FUNERAL BUT GEORGIANA ENTREATED ME TO STAY TILL SHE COULD GET OFF TO LONDON WHITHER
AS HE HAD TALKED OF PURCHASING A NEW CARRIAGE SHE SAID THE IDEA OF HIS MARRYING MISS INGRAM STILL SEEMED STRANGE TO HER BUT FROM WHAT EVERYBODY SAID
OH YES SIR EVERYBODY KNEW YOUR ERRAND YOU MUST SEE THE CARRIAGE JANE AND TELL ME IF YOU DON'T THINK IT WILL SUIT MISSUS ROCHESTER EXACTLY
THE WEST TOO WAS WARM NO WATERY GLEAM CHILLED IT IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WAS A FIRE LIT AN ALTAR BURNING BEHIND ITS SCREEN OF MARBLED VAPOUR
AND ADDED THAT HE SAW ADELE WAS PRETE A
AND SHE ADDED I AM OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR VALUABLE SERVICES AND DISCREET CONDUCT THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIVING WITH SUCH AN ONE AS YOU AND WITH GEORGIANA
IN LISTENING I SOBBED CONVULSIVELY FOR I COULD REPRESS WHAT I ENDURED NO LONGER I WAS OBLIGED TO YIELD AND I WAS SHAKEN FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH ACUTE DISTRESS
PERHAPS IF I WALK SOFTLY I CAN SLIP AWAY UNNOTICED I TRODE ON AN EDGING OF TURF THAT THE CRACKLE OF THE PEBBLY GRAVEL MIGHT NOT BETRAY ME
THE VEHEMENCE OF EMOTION STIRRED BY GRIEF AND LOVE WITHIN ME WAS CLAIMING MASTERY AND STRUGGLING FOR FULL SWAY AND ASSERTING A RIGHT TO PREDOMINATE TO OVERCOME
THE GAPING VAULT THE SILENT CHURCH THE SOLEMN SERVICE
DECENTLY AND IN ORDER I SHALL EMBRACE THE TENETS OF ROME AND PROBABLY TAKE THE VEIL I NEITHER EXPRESSED SURPRISE AT THIS RESOLUTION
I AVOIDED SOBBING THE THOUGHT OF MISSUS O'GALL AND BITTERNUTT LODGE STRUCK
THE SWEETEST HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR DAY ITS FERVID FIRES HAD WASTED AND DEW FELL COOL ON PANTING PLAIN AND SCORCHED SUMMIT
DEAD AND TELLS ME SO WHEN SHE MEETS ME ALONE HERE IN THE GLOAMING IF I DARED I'D TOUCH YOU TO SEE IF YOU ARE SUBSTANCE OR SHADOW YOU ELF
IT IS TO BE SURE AND WHEN YOU GET TO BITTERNUTT LODGE CONNAUGHT IRELAND I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN JANE
THAT THE MATCH WAS BROKEN OFF THAT RUMOUR HAD BEEN MISTAKEN THAT ONE OR BOTH PARTIES HAD CHANGED THEIR MINDS I USED TO LOOK AT MY MASTER'S FACE TO SEE IF IT WERE SAD OR FIERCE
SEEMED TO TAKE PLEASURE IN THE SPECTACLE OF A GROUP SO AMICABLE WHEN HE SAID HE SUPPOSED THE OLD LADY WAS ALL RIGHT NOW THAT SHE HAD GOT HER ADOPTED DAUGHTER BACK AGAIN
NOW LIFTING THE GOOSEBERRY TREE BRANCHES TO LOOK AT THE FRUIT LARGE AS PLUMS WITH WHICH THEY ARE LADEN NOW TAKING A RIPE CHERRY FROM THE WALL
WHAT BRIDE I HAVE NO BRIDE BUT YOU WILL HAVE YES I WILL I WILL HE SET HIS TEETH
THEY ARE MAKING HAY TOO IN THORNFIELD MEADOWS OR RATHER THE LABOURERS ARE JUST QUITTING THEIR WORK AND RETURNING HOME WITH THEIR RAKES ON THEIR SHOULDERS
WHAT THE DEUCE HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOURSELF THIS LAST MONTH I HAVE BEEN WITH MY AUNT SIR WHO IS DEAD
I BELIEVE YOU MUST JANE I AM SORRY JANET BUT I BELIEVE INDEED YOU MUST THIS WAS A BLOW BUT I DID NOT LET IT PROSTRATE ME
SHE STAYED IN HER OWN ROOM HER DOOR BOLTED WITHIN FILLING TRUNKS EMPTYING DRAWERS BURNING PAPERS AND HOLDING NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANY ONE
AND FURNACE FLAME AT ONE POINT ON ONE HILL PEAK AND EXTENDING HIGH AND WIDE SOFT AND STILL
ANOTHER EFFORT SET ME AT LIBERTY AND I STOOD
DURING THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS I THOUGHT OF MISSUS REED IN HER LAST MOMENTS I SAW HER DISFIGURED AND DISCOLOURED FACE AND HEARD HER
AND THOUGHTS BUSILY BENT ON DISCOVERING A MEANS OF EXTRICATION BUT HE HIMSELF LOOKED SO COMPOSED AND SO GRAVE ALSO I BECAME ASHAMED OF FEELING ANY CONFUSION
NOR ATTEMPTED TO DISSUADE HER FROM IT THE VOCATION WILL FIT YOU TO A HAIR I THOUGHT MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO YOU WHEN WE PARTED SHE SAID GOOD BYE COUSIN JANE EYRE I WISH YOU WELL
I STEP ASIDE INTO THE IVY RECESS HE WILL NOT STAY LONG HE WILL SOON RETURN WHENCE HE CAME AND IF I SIT STILL HE WILL NEVER SEE ME BUT NO
WITH REGARD TO YOU ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE NEAR ME AS NOW IT IS AS IF I HAD A STRING SOMEWHERE UNDER MY LEFT RIBS TIGHTLY AND INEXTRICABLY KNOTTED
BUT IN THREADING THE FLOWER AND FRUIT PARTERRES AT THE UPPER PART OF THE ENCLOSURE ENTICED THERE BY THE LIGHT THE NOW RISING MOON CAST ON THIS MORE OPEN QUARTER MY STEP
YOU'RE NOT TURNING YOUR HEAD TO LOOK AFTER MORE MOTHS ARE YOU THAT WAS ONLY A LADY CLOCK CHILD FLYING AWAY HOME
NO VISITS TO INGRAM PARK TO BE SURE IT WAS TWENTY MILES OFF ON THE BORDERS OF ANOTHER COUNTY BUT WHAT WAS THAT DISTANCE TO AN ARDENT LOVER
TO ONE WITH WHOM YOU HAVE NO SYMPATHY WHOM I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU TRULY LOVE FOR I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD YOU SNEER AT HER I WOULD SCORN SUCH A UNION THEREFORE I AM BETTER THAN YOU LET ME GO
KNEELING ON THE CARPET HAD NESTLED CLOSE UP TO ME AND A SENSE OF MUTUAL AFFECTION SEEMED TO SURROUND US WITH A RING OF GOLDEN PEACE I UTTERED A SILENT PRAYER
FOR THE HOUR OF REPOSE IS EXPIRED MUST I MOVE ON SIR I ASKED MUST I LEAVE THORNFIELD
IT IS TRUE THAT WHILE I WORKED SHE WOULD IDLE AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IF YOU AND I WERE DESTINED
ABSENT FROM ME A WHOLE MONTH AND FORGETTING ME QUITE I'LL BE SWORN I KNEW THERE WOULD BE PLEASURE IN MEETING MY MASTER AGAIN
TO LONG FOR A PLENTEOUS MEAL AND A GOOD FIRE AND TO BE UNABLE TO GET EITHER NEITHER OF THESE RETURNINGS WAS VERY PLEASANT OR DESIRABLE
WARBLING IN A WOOD HALF A MILE OFF NO MOVING FORM IS VISIBLE NO COMING STEP
GEORGIANA SAID SHE DREADED BEING LEFT ALONE WITH ELIZA FROM HER SHE GOT NEITHER SYMPATHY IN HER DEJECTION SUPPORT IN HER FEARS NOR AID IN HER PREPARATIONS
YOU HAVE SOME SENSE I THEN RETURNED YOU ARE NOT WITHOUT SENSE COUSIN ELIZA BUT WHAT YOU HAVE I SUPPOSE IN ANOTHER YEAR WILL BE WALLED UP ALIVE IN A FRENCH CONVENT
MY ONLY HOME I WALKED ON SO FAST THAT EVEN HE COULD HARDLY HAVE OVERTAKEN ME HAD HE TRIED LITTLE ADELE WAS HALF WILD WITH DELIGHT WHEN SHE SAW ME
I LEFT REMINISCENCE FOR ANTICIPATION I WAS GOING BACK TO THORNFIELD BUT HOW LONG WAS I TO STAY THERE NOT LONG OF THAT I WAS SURE
I DID NOT THINK I SHOULD TREMBLE IN THIS WAY WHEN I SAW HIM OR LOSE MY VOICE OR THE POWER OF MOTION IN HIS PRESENCE I WILL GO BACK AS SOON AS I CAN STIR
HOWEVER IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS AND SO IT SUITS YOU I DON'T MUCH CARE YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT SAID SHE AND WITH THESE WORDS WE EACH WENT OUR SEPARATE WAY
I SEE THE NARROW STILE WITH STONE STEPS AND I SEE MISTER ROCHESTER SITTING THERE A BOOK AND A PENCIL IN HIS HAND HE IS WRITING
I'VE A NERVOUS NOTION I SHOULD TAKE TO BLEEDING INWARDLY AS FOR YOU YOU'D FORGET ME THAT I NEVER SHOULD SIR YOU KNOW IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED JANE
I SHOULD ASSIGN YOU YOUR SHARE OF LABOUR AND COMPEL YOU TO ACCOMPLISH IT OR ELSE IT SHOULD BE LEFT UNDONE
THEN I MUST GO YOU HAVE SAID IT YOURSELF NO YOU MUST STAY I SWEAR IT AND THE OATH SHALL BE KEPT
WHILE SUCH HONEY DEW FELL SUCH SILENCE REIGNED SUCH GLOAMING GATHERED I FELT AS IF I COULD HAUNT SUCH SHADE FOR EVER
JUST AS IF BOTH HAD PASSED THROUGH THE GRAVE AND WE STOOD AT GOD'S FEET EQUAL AS WE ARE AS WE ARE
STRANGELY ALTERED VOICE I MUSED ON THE FUNERAL DAY THE COFFIN THE HEARSE THE BLACK TRAIN OF TENANTS AND SERVANTS FEW WAS THE NUMBER OF RELATIVES
WELL HE IS NOT A GHOST YET EVERY NERVE I HAVE IS UNSTRUNG FOR A MOMENT I AM BEYOND MY OWN MASTERY WHAT DOES IT MEAN
JANET SAID HE MAKING ROOM FOR ME TO CROSS THE STILE GO UP HOME AND STAY YOUR WEARY LITTLE WANDERING FEET AT A FRIEND'S THRESHOLD
DO YOU THINK BECAUSE I AM POOR OBSCURE PLAIN AND LITTLE I AM SOULLESS AND HEARTLESS YOU THINK WRONG I HAVE AS MUCH SOUL AS YOU
A DEPENDENT DOES HER DUTY AS WELL AS YOU HAVE DONE YOURS
I DID NOT LIKE TO WALK AT THIS HOUR ALONE WITH MISTER ROCHESTER IN THE SHADOWY ORCHARD BUT I COULD NOT FIND A REASON TO ALLEGE FOR LEAVING HIM I FOLLOWED WITH LAGGING STEP
A NUNNERY YOU WOULD CALL IT THERE I SHALL BE QUIET AND UNMOLESTED
MISSUS FAIRFAX RECEIVED ME WITH HER USUAL PLAIN FRIENDLINESS LEAH SMILED AND EVEN SOPHIE BID ME BON SOIR WITH GLEE
WAS SUCH AS PROMISED WELL FOR THE FUTURE ITS BLUE WHERE BLUE WAS VISIBLE WAS MILD AND SETTLED AND ITS CLOUD STRATA HIGH AND THIN
WELL SIR I SHALL BE READY WHEN THE ORDER TO MARCH COMES IT IS COME NOW I MUST GIVE IT TO NIGHT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO BE MARRIED SIR
NOTHING TO YOU DO YOU THINK I AM AN AUTOMATON
AND FULL AS MUCH HEART AND IF GOD HAD GIFTED ME WITH SOME BEAUTY AND MUCH WEALTH I SHOULD HAVE MADE IT AS HARD FOR YOU TO LEAVE ME AS IT IS NOW FOR ME TO LEAVE YOU
THE HAY WAS ALL GOT IN THE FIELDS ROUND THORNFIELD WERE GREEN AND SHORN THE ROADS WHITE AND BAKED THE TREES WERE IN THEIR DARK PRIME HEDGE AND WOOD
HE WAS STANDING AMONG THE BEDS AT A YARD OR TWO DISTANT FROM WHERE I HAD TO PASS THE MOTH APPARENTLY ENGAGED HIM I SHALL GET BY VERY WELL I MEDITATED
I REJOINED AND YET NOT SO FOR YOU ARE A MARRIED MAN OR AS GOOD AS A MARRIED MAN AND WED TO ONE INFERIOR TO YOU
AND MISTER ROCHESTER LOOKED ON WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED SMILING SARDONICALLY AS IT SEEMED AT BOTH HER AND ME I HAD NOT NOTIFIED TO MISSUS FAIRFAX THE EXACT
ONCE SHE SAID SHE HAD ACTUALLY PUT THE QUESTION TO MISTER ROCHESTER AS TO WHEN HE WAS GOING TO BRING HIS BRIDE HOME BUT HE HAD ANSWERED HER
MISSUS FAIRFAX WILL SMILE YOU A CALM WELCOME TO BE SURE SAID I AND LITTLE ADELE WILL CLAP HER HANDS AND JUMP TO SEE YOU
AND IN SPITE OF ME THANK YOU MISTER ROCHESTER FOR YOUR GREAT KINDNESS I AM STRANGELY GLAD TO GET BACK AGAIN TO YOU AND WHEREVER YOU ARE IS MY HOME
SHONE A GOLDEN REDNESS I FELT GLAD AS THE ROAD SHORTENED BEFORE ME SO GLAD THAT I STOPPED ONCE TO ASK MYSELF
AND HIMSELF IT IS A LONG WAY TO IRELAND JANET AND I AM SORRY TO SEND MY LITTLE FRIEND ON SUCH WEARY TRAVELS BUT IF I CAN'T DO BETTER
IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF MY ABRUPT VOCAL RESPONSE BUT HE SMILED AT ME WITH A CERTAIN SMILE HE HAD OF HIS OWN
AND MORE EDEN LIKE IT WAS FULL OF TREES IT BLOOMED WITH FLOWERS A VERY HIGH WALL SHUT IT OUT FROM THE COURT ON ONE SIDE ON THE OTHER A BEECH AVENUE SCREENED IT FROM THE LAWN
FULL LEAVED AND DEEPLY TINTED CONTRASTED WELL WITH THE SUNNY HUE OF THE CLEARED MEADOWS BETWEEN ON MIDSUMMER EVE ADELE
IN ABOUT A MONTH I HOPE TO BE A BRIDEGROOM CONTINUED MISTER ROCHESTER AND IN THE INTERIM I SHALL
HEARD OF A PLACE THAT I THINK WILL SUIT IT IS TO UNDERTAKE THE EDUCATION
THAT HE WAS SO SOON TO CEASE TO BE MY MASTER
IT ALIGHTS ON A PLANT AT MISTER ROCHESTER'S FOOT HE SEES IT AND BENDS TO EXAMINE IT NOW HE HAS HIS BACK TOWARDS ME THOUGHT I AND HE IS OCCUPIED TOO
CUSTOM INTERVENED BETWEEN ME AND WHAT I NATURALLY AND INEVITABLY LOVED IT IS A LONG WAY I AGAIN SAID
HE IS FLOWN THE MOTH ROAMED AWAY I WAS SHEEPISHLY RETREATING ALSO BUT MISTER ROCHESTER FOLLOWED ME AND WHEN WE REACHED THE WICKET HE SAID TURN BACK
BECAUSE I HAVE LIVED IN IT A FULL AND DELIGHTFUL LIFE MOMENTARILY AT LEAST I HAVE NOT BEEN TRAMPLED ON I HAVE NOT BEEN PETRIFIED
FOR I DID NOT WISH EITHER CAR OR CARRIAGE TO MEET ME AT MILLCOTE I PROPOSED TO WALK THE DISTANCE QUIETLY BY MYSELF AND VERY QUIETLY AFTER LEAVING MY BOX IN THE OSTLER'S CARE
MY JOURNEY SEEMED TEDIOUS VERY TEDIOUS FIFTY MILES ONE DAY A NIGHT SPENT AT AN INN FIFTY MILES THE NEXT DAY
IN SHORT SHE'S AN EXTENSIVE ARMFUL BUT THAT'S NOT TO THE POINT
THAT I CONSENT THUS TO RENDER IT SO PATIENT AND COMPLIANT ON MY PART AT LAST I SAW GEORGIANA OFF
AND IF THAT BOISTEROUS CHANNEL AND TWO HUNDRED MILES OR SO OF LAND COME BROAD BETWEEN US I AM AFRAID THAT CORD OF COMMUNION WILL BE SNAPT AND THEN
NOW AT THE HOUR I ARRIVE I HAVE BUT A FIELD OR TWO TO TRAVERSE AND THEN I SHALL CROSS THE ROAD AND REACH THE GATES
WHERE YOU SIR HAVE PLACED IT BEFORE ME IN WHAT SHAPE IN THE SHAPE OF MISS INGRAM A NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN YOUR BRIDE MY BRIDE
DID I SLIP AWAY FROM THE GEORGE INN ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK OF A JUNE EVENING AND TAKE THE OLD ROAD TO THORNFIELD A ROAD WHICH LAY CHIEFLY THROUGH FIELDS AND WAS NOW LITTLE FREQUENTED
IT WAS NOT A BRIGHT OR SPLENDID SUMMER EVENING THOUGH FAIR AND SOFT THE HAYMAKERS WERE AT WORK ALL ALONG THE ROAD AND THE SKY THOUGH FAR FROM CLOUDLESS
AGAINST THE VOICE THAT KEPT WARNING ME OF NEAR SEPARATION AND COMING GRIEF
WE'LL TALK OVER THE VOYAGE AND THE PARTING QUIETLY HALF AN HOUR OR SO WHILE THE STARS ENTER INTO THEIR SHINING LIFE UP IN HEAVEN YONDER HERE IS THE CHESTNUT TREE
AND YOU ARE PARTED FROM HIM FOR EVER AND THEN I STRANGLED A NEW BORN AGONY A DEFORMED THING WHICH I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF TO OWN AND REAR AND RAN ON
YES SIR IN DIFFERENT WAYS I HAVE AN AFFECTION FOR BOTH
AND MEANT TO LEAVE HIM CALMLY AN IMPULSE HELD ME FAST A FORCE TURNED ME ROUND I SAID OR SOMETHING IN ME SAID FOR ME
TO A SIMILAR STRING SITUATED IN THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF YOUR LITTLE FRAME
NOT TO SEND FOR A CARRIAGE AND COME CLATTERING OVER STREET AND ROAD LIKE A COMMON MORTAL BUT TO STEAL INTO THE VICINAGE OF YOUR HOME ALONG WITH TWILIGHT
ALL I HAD NOW TO DO WAS TO OBEY HIM IN SILENCE NO NEED FOR ME TO COLLOQUISE FURTHER I GOT OVER THE STILE WITHOUT A WORD
HOW FULL THE HEDGES ARE OF ROSES BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO GATHER ANY I WANT TO BE AT THE HOUSE I PASSED A TALL BRIAR SHOOTING LEAFY AND FLOWERY BRANCHES ACROSS THE PATH
WHEN I DID SPEAK IT WAS ONLY TO EXPRESS AN IMPETUOUS WISH THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN BORN OR NEVER COME TO THORNFIELD BECAUSE YOU ARE SORRY TO LEAVE IT
OF A BALL ROOM THE OTHER THE INMATE OF A CONVENT CELL AND I DWELT ON AND ANALYSED THEIR SEPARATE PECULIARITIES OF PERSON AND CHARACTER
SHE WAS NOW AT LAST INVITED BY HER UNCLE MISTER GIBSON
WHERE JANE TO IRELAND YES TO IRELAND I HAVE SPOKEN MY MIND AND CAN GO ANYWHERE NOW JANE BE STILL DON'T STRUGGLE SO LIKE A WILD FRANTIC
WITH WHAT I REVERENCE WITH WHAT I DELIGHT IN WITH AN ORIGINAL A VIGOROUS AN EXPANDED MIND I HAVE KNOWN YOU MISTER ROCHESTER AND IT STRIKES ME WITH TERROR
BUT THAT PERFUME INCREASES I MUST FLEE I MAKE FOR THE WICKET LEADING TO THE SHRUBBERY AND I SEE MISTER ROCHESTER ENTERING
I NEED NOT MAKE AN ABSOLUTE FOOL OF MYSELF I KNOW ANOTHER WAY TO THE HOUSE IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY IF I KNEW TWENTY WAYS FOR HE HAS SEEN ME
HERE IS THE BENCH AT ITS OLD ROOTS COME WE WILL SIT THERE IN PEACE TO NIGHT THOUGH WE SHOULD NEVER MORE BE DESTINED TO SIT THERE TOGETHER HE SEATED ME
BUT I'D AS SOON OFFER TO TAKE HOLD OF A BLUE IGNIS FATUUS LIGHT IN A MARSH TRUANT TRUANT HE ADDED WHEN HE HAD PAUSED AN INSTANT
LOOK AT HIS WINGS SAID HE HE REMINDS ME RATHER OF A WEST INDIAN INSECT ONE DOES NOT OFTEN SEE SO LARGE AND GAY A NIGHT ROVER IN ENGLAND THERE
AT THIS MOMENT THE BOW
BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO STRING THE BOW AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON
THERE IS NOT A MAN OF US ALL WHO IS SUCH ANOTHER AS ULYSSES FOR I HAVE SEEN HIM AND REMEMBER HIM THOUGH I WAS THEN ONLY A CHILD
IF SOME GOD WERE BUT TO BRING ULYSSES BACK YOU SHOULD SEE WITH WHAT MIGHT AND MAIN I WOULD FIGHT FOR HIM IN LIKE WORDS EUMAEUS PRAYED TO ALL THE GODS THAT ULYSSES MIGHT RETURN WHEN THEREFORE
HE SHED THE ARROWS ON TO THE GROUND AT HIS FEET AND SAID THE MIGHTY CONTEST IS AT AN END I WILL NOW SEE WHETHER APOLLO WILL VOUCHSAFE IT TO ME TO HIT ANOTHER MARK WHICH NO MAN HAS YET HIT
TO TELL THE WOMEN AND MAKE THEM COME TO ULYSSES IN THE MEANTIME HE CALLED TELEMACHUS THE STOCKMAN AND THE SWINEHERD BEGIN SAID HE TO REMOVE THE DEAD AND MAKE THE WOMEN HELP YOU THEN
AND TELL THOSE WHO ARE WITHIN WHEN YOU GO IN DO SO SEPARATELY NOT BOTH TOGETHER I WILL GO FIRST AND DO YOU FOLLOW AFTERWARDS LET THIS MOREOVER BE THE TOKEN BETWEEN US THE SUITORS
AND PUT IT OUT OF DOORS THEN WHEN THEY HAD MADE THE WHOLE PLACE QUITE CLEAN AND ORDERLY
IN THE NARROW SPACE BETWEEN THE WALL OF THE DOMED ROOM AND THAT OF THE YARD SO THAT THEY COULD NOT GET AWAY AND TELEMACHUS SAID TO THE OTHER TWO I SHALL NOT LET THESE WOMEN DIE A CLEAN DEATH
FOR THE FOOT WHICH YOU GAVE ULYSSES WHEN HE WAS BEGGING ABOUT IN HIS OWN HOUSE THUS SPOKE THE STOCKMAN AND ULYSSES STRUCK THE SON OF DAMASTOR WITH A SPEAR IN CLOSE FIGHT
I GRIEVE THAT I SHALL HAVE TO FORGO THE MARRIAGE BUT I DO NOT CARE NEARLY SO MUCH ABOUT THIS FOR THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WOMEN IN ITHACA AND ELSEWHERE WHAT I FEEL MOST IS THE FACT OF OUR BEING SO INFERIOR TO ULYSSES IN STRENGTH
ALONG WITH FRAGRANT HERBS REACHING THENCE SHE TOOK DOWN THE BOW WITH ITS BOW CASE FROM THE PEG ON WHICH IT HUNG SHE SAT DOWN WITH IT ON HER KNEES WEEPING BITTERLY AS SHE TOOK THE BOW OUT OF ITS CASE
FOR SHE SAW THAT A GREAT DEED HAD BEEN DONE BUT ULYSSES CHECKED HER OLD WOMAN SAID HE REJOICE IN SILENCE RESTRAIN YOURSELF AND DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISE ABOUT IT IT IS AN UNHOLY THING
BY AND BY MELANTHIUS CAME OUT WITH A HELMET IN ONE HAND AND AN OLD DRY ROTTED SHIELD IN THE OTHER
ANTINOUS SAID SHE IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD ILL TREAT ANY GUEST OF TELEMACHUS WHO COMES TO THIS HOUSE IF THE STRANGER SHOULD PROVE STRONG ENOUGH TO STRING THE MIGHTY BOW OF ULYSSES
OR WITH ULYSSES FATHER JOVE ANSWERED THE STOCKMAN WOULD INDEED
I APPEAL MORE ESPECIALLY TO EURYMACHUS AND TO ANTINOUS WHO HAS JUST SPOKEN WITH SO MUCH REASON CEASE SHOOTING FOR THE PRESENT AND LEAVE THE MATTER TO THE GODS BUT IN THE MORNING
BUT HE BROUGHT IT UPON HIMSELF THROUGH HIS OWN DRUNKENNESS IN LIKE MANNER I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WILL GO HARDLY WITH YOU IF YOU STRING THE BOW YOU WILL FIND NO MERCY FROM ANY ONE HERE
AS HE HAD BIDDEN HER AND ULYSSES THOROUGHLY PURIFIED THE CLOISTERS AND BOTH THE INNER AND OUTER COURTS THEN SHE WENT INSIDE TO CALL THE WOMEN AND TELL THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEREON THEY CAME FROM THEIR APARTMENT
THIS IS WHAT WILL BE SAID AND IT WILL BE A SCANDAL AGAINST US EURYMACHUS PENELOPE ANSWERED PEOPLE WHO PERSIST IN EATING UP THE ESTATE OF A GREAT CHIEFTAIN
SO THAT HE FELL HEAVILY TO THE GROUND AND STRUCK THE EARTH WITH HIS FOREHEAD THEN TELEMACHUS SPRANG AWAY FROM HIM LEAVING HIS SPEAR STILL IN THE BODY FOR HE FEARED THAT IF HE STAYED TO DRAW IT OUT
EVEN SO DID ULYSSES AND HIS MEN FALL UPON THE SUITORS AND SMITE THEM ON EVERY SIDE THEY MADE A HORRIBLE GROANING AS THEIR BRAINS WERE BEING BATTERED IN AND THE GROUND SEETHED WITH THEIR BLOOD
SO THEY MADE ME TELEMACHUS HEARD HIM
YOU SHALL SEE NO OTHER CONTEST YOU ARE A DOOMED MAN HE WHOM YOU HAVE SLAIN WAS THE FOREMOST YOUTH IN ITHACA AND THE VULTURES SHALL DEVOUR YOU FOR HAVING KILLED HIM
AND DISHONOURING HIS HOUSE MUST NOT EXPECT OTHERS TO THINK WELL OF THEM WHY THEN SHOULD YOU MIND IF MEN TALK AS YOU THINK THEY WILL THIS STRANGER IS STRONG AND WELL BUILT HE SAYS MOREOVER
THIS DONE HE WENT ON TO THE PAVEMENT TO MAKE TRIAL OF THE BOW THRICE DID HE TUG AT IT TRYING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO DRAW THE STRING AND THRICE HE HAD TO LEAVE OFF
STRUNG IT AS EASILY AS A SKILLED BARD STRINGS A NEW PEG OF HIS LYRE AND MAKES THE TWISTED GUT FAST AT BOTH ENDS THEN HE TOOK IT IN HIS RIGHT HAND TO PROVE THE STRING AND IT SANG SWEETLY UNDER HIS TOUCH
IN BEING ALLOWED TO DINE UNHARMED AMONG YOUR BETTERS WITHOUT HAVING ANY SMALLER PORTION SERVED YOU THAN WE OTHERS HAVE HAD AND IN BEING ALLOWED TO HEAR OUR CONVERSATION
YOU COUNTRY LOUTS SAID HE SILLY SIMPLETONS WHY SHOULD YOU ADD TO THE SORROWS OF YOUR MISTRESS BY CRYING IN THIS WAY SHE HAS ENOUGH TO GRIEVE HER IN THE LOSS OF HER HUSBAND SIT STILL THEREFORE
AND SEND HIS ARROW THROUGH EACH ONE OF TWELVE AXES HIM WILL I FOLLOW AND QUIT THIS HOUSE OF MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SO GOODLY AND SO ABOUNDING IN WEALTH BUT EVEN SO I DOUBT NOT THAT I SHALL REMEMBER IT IN MY DREAMS
I WILL NOW GIVE YOU CONVINCING PROOFS THAT YOU MAY KNOW ME AND BE ASSURED SEE HERE IS THE SCAR FROM THE BOAR'S TOOTH THAT RIPPED ME WHEN I WAS OUT HUNTING ON MT PARNASSUS
THAT WAS OWING FROM THE WHOLE PEOPLE FOR THE MESSENIANS HAD CARRIED OFF THREE HUNDRED SHEEP FROM ITHACA AND HAD SAILED AWAY WITH THEM AND WITH THEIR SHEPHERDS IN QUEST OF THESE ULYSSES TOOK A LONG JOURNEY WHILE STILL QUITE YOUNG
WHEN HE HAD TAKEN AIM HE LET FLY AND HIS ARROW PIERCED EVERY ONE OF THE HANDLE HOLES OF THE AXES FROM THE FIRST ONWARDS TILL IT HAD GONE RIGHT THROUGH THEM AND INTO THE OUTER COURTYARD THEN HE SAID TO TELEMACHUS
YET I AM LAUGHING AND ENJOYING MYSELF AS THOUGH THERE WERE NOTHING HAPPENING BUT SUITORS AS THE CONTEST HAS BEEN AGREED UPON LET IT GO FORWARD IT IS FOR A WOMAN WHOSE PEER IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN PYLOS
THAT THE SON OF SCHEMING SATURN HAD SENT HIM
THAT YOU ARE SO LAMENTABLY LESS VALIANT NOW THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN GROUND FACE TO FACE WITH THE SUITORS IN YOUR OWN HOUSE COME ON MY GOOD FELLOW STAND BY MY SIDE AND SEE HOW MENTOR
AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HIS RAGS ASIDE FROM THE GREAT SCAR AND WHEN THEY HAD EXAMINED IT THOROUGHLY THEY BOTH OF THEM WEPT ABOUT ULYSSES THREW THEIR ARMS ROUND HIM AND KISSED HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS
FOR THEY FEARED HE MIGHT STRING THE BOW ANTINOUS THEREFORE REBUKED HIM FIERCELY SAYING WRETCHED CREATURE YOU HAVE NOT SO MUCH AS A GRAIN OF SENSE IN YOUR WHOLE BODY YOU OUGHT TO THINK YOURSELF LUCKY
NOT IF I CAN WIN THE PRIZES WHICH MY FATHER WON BEFORE ME AS HE SPOKE HE SPRANG FROM HIS SEAT THREW HIS CRIMSON CLOAK FROM HIM
TILL THE HEAT OF THE SUN MAKES AN END OF THEM EVEN SO WERE THE SUITORS LYING ALL HUDDLED UP ONE AGAINST THE OTHER THEN ULYSSES SAID TO TELEMACHUS
O SWINEHERD EUMAEUS SAYING MELANTHIUS YOU WILL PASS THE NIGHT ON A SOFT BED AS YOU DESERVE
OR YOUNG AS I AM I WILL PELT YOU WITH STONES BACK TO THE COUNTRY FOR I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO I WISH I WAS AS MUCH STRONGER THAN ALL THE OTHER SUITORS IN THE HOUSE AS I AM THAN YOU
ABOVE HIS SHIELD BUT THE SPEAR WENT ON AND FELL TO THE GROUND THEN ULYSSES AND HIS MEN LET DRIVE INTO THE CROWD OF SUITORS
KILLED IPHITUS ERE THEY COULD DO SO THIS BOW THEN
GET SPONGES AND CLEAN WATER TO SWILL DOWN THE TABLES AND SEATS WHEN YOU HAVE THOROUGHLY CLEANSED THE WHOLE CLOISTERS TAKE THE WOMEN INTO THE SPACE BETWEEN THE DOMED ROOM AND THE WALL OF THE OUTER COURT AND RUN THEM THROUGH WITH YOUR SWORDS
IT IS TIME FOR THE ACHAEANS TO PREPARE SUPPER WHILE THERE IS STILL DAYLIGHT AND THEN OTHERWISE TO DISPORT THEMSELVES WITH SONG AND DANCE WHICH ARE THE CROWNING ORNAMENTS OF A BANQUET
THE WINE MUST HAVE BEEN DOING YOU A MISCHIEF
NOT A MAN OF YOU SHALL THEIR HEARTS SANK AS THEY HEARD HIM
AND REQUITE YOUR KINDNESSES CONFERRED UPON HIM BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE HIM FULL VICTORY AS YET FOR SHE WISHED STILL FURTHER TO PROVE HIS OWN PROWESS AND THAT OF HIS BRAVE SON
COME ON EACH OF YOU IN HIS TURN
BEARING A CHEST THAT CONTAINED MUCH IRON AND BRONZE WHICH HER HUSBAND HAD WON AS PRIZES WHEN SHE REACHED THE SUITORS SHE STOOD BY ONE OF THE BEARING POSTS SUPPORTING THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER
SHE WENT WONDERING BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND LAID HER SON'S SAYING IN HER HEART THEN GOING UPSTAIRS WITH HER HANDMAIDS INTO HER ROOM SHE MOURNED HER DEAR HUSBAND TILL MINERVA SENT SWEET SLEEP OVER HER EYELIDS
CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD TAKE ME HOME WITH HIM
THOUGH HE HAD HOPED TO STRING THE BOW AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON HE WAS TRYING FOR THE FOURTH TIME AND WOULD HAVE STRUNG IT HAD NOT ULYSSES MADE A SIGN TO CHECK HIM IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EAGERNESS SO HE SAID ALAS
LIKE THE TWITTERING OF A SWALLOW THE SUITORS WERE DISMAYED AND TURNED COLOUR AS THEY HEARD IT AT THAT MOMENT MOREOVER JOVE THUNDERED LOUDLY AS A SIGN AND THE HEART OF ULYSSES REJOICED AS HE HEARD THE OMEN
HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN WITH HIM BY ULYSSES WHEN HE SAILED FOR TROY HE HAD USED IT SO LONG AS HE HAD BEEN AT HOME BUT HAD LEFT IT BEHIND AS HAVING BEEN A KEEPSAKE FROM A VALUED FRIEND
AND ALSO ALL THE MAIDSERVANTS THAT ARE IN THE HOUSE ALL THAT YOU HAVE SAID IS TRUE
YOUR GUEST HAS NOT DISGRACED YOU TELEMACHUS I DID NOT MISS WHAT I AIMED AT AND I WAS NOT LONG IN STRINGING MY BOW I AM STILL STRONG AND NOT AS THE SUITORS TWIT ME WITH BEING NOW HOWEVER
BUT THE SWINEHERD SAW HIM AND SAID TO ULYSSES WHO WAS BESIDE HIM ULYSSES
WHO WAS WARMING IT BY THE FIRE BUT EVEN SO HE COULD NOT STRING IT AND HE WAS GREATLY GRIEVED HE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH AND SAID
FOR HIS FATHER AND THE OTHER CHIEFTAINS SENT HIM ON A MISSION TO RECOVER THEM
I THINK I WILL SAY IT WHAT MANNER OF MEN WOULD YOU BE TO STAND BY ULYSSES IF SOME GOD SHOULD BRING HIM BACK HERE ALL OF A SUDDEN SAY WHICH YOU ARE DISPOSED TO DO TO SIDE WITH THE SUITORS
THERE WAS A SHIP'S CABLE OF BYBLUS FIBRE LYING IN THE GATEHOUSE SO HE MADE THE GATES FAST WITH IT AND THEN CAME IN AGAIN RESUMING THE SEAT THAT HE HAD LEFT AND KEEPING AN EYE ON ULYSSES WHO HAD NOW GOT THE BOW IN HIS HANDS
BUT MINERVA MADE THEM ALL OF NO EFFECT ONE HIT THE DOOR POST ANOTHER WENT AGAINST THE DOOR THE POINTED SHAFT OF ANOTHER STRUCK THE WALL AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD AVOIDED ALL THE SPEARS OF THE SUITORS
WHILE THE POINTED SHAFT OF ANOTHER STRUCK THE WALL STILL AMPHIMEDON JUST TOOK A PIECE OF THE TOP SKIN FROM OFF TELEMACHUS'S WRIST
WHILE ULYSSES KISSED THEIR HANDS AND FACES IN RETURN THE SUN WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN UPON THEIR MOURNING IF ULYSSES HAD NOT CHECKED THEM AND SAID CEASE YOUR WEEPING LEST SOME ONE SHOULD COME OUTSIDE AND SEE US
WERE SO SHORTLY ABOUT TO TASTE WERE ALL INSIDE THE QUIVER HE LAID IT ON THE CENTRE PIECE OF THE BOW AND DREW THE NOTCH OF THE ARROW
THE REST APPROVED HIS WORDS AND THEREON MEN SERVANTS POURED WATER OVER THE HANDS OF THE GUESTS WHILE PAGES FILLED THE MIXING BOWLS WITH WINE AND WATER AND HANDED IT ROUND AFTER GIVING EVERY MAN HIS DRINK OFFERING
AND ARMED HIMSELF FIRST WHILE THE STOCKMAN AND THE SWINEHERD ALSO PUT ON THEIR ARMOUR AND TOOK THEIR PLACES NEAR ULYSSES MEANWHILE ULYSSES AS LONG AS HIS ARROWS LASTED HAD BEEN SHOOTING THE SUITORS ONE BY ONE
BUT LET US SEE WHETHER YOU CAN STRING THE BOW OR NO I TOO WILL MAKE TRIAL OF IT FOR IF I CAN STRING IT AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON I SHALL NOT SUFFER MY MOTHER TO QUIT THIS HOUSE WITH A STRANGER
AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HIS KEEN BLADE OF BRONZE SHARPENED ON BOTH SIDES AND WITH A LOUD CRY SPRANG TOWARDS ULYSSES BUT ULYSSES INSTANTLY SHOT AN ARROW INTO HIS BREAST THAT CAUGHT HIM BY THE NIPPLE AND FIXED ITSELF IN HIS LIVER
OR EUMAEUS HAS ALREADY KILLED HIM OR HE HAS FALLEN IN YOUR WAY WHEN YOU WERE RAGING ABOUT THE COURT MEDON CAUGHT THESE WORDS OF TELEMACHUS FOR HE WAS CROUCHING UNDER A SEAT
HIM THE GLORY OF STRINGING IT I WILL GIVE HIM A CLOAK AND SHIRT OF GOOD WEAR WITH A JAVELIN TO KEEP OFF DOGS AND ROBBERS AND A SHARP SWORD I WILL ALSO GIVE HIM SANDALS AND WILL SEE HIM SENT SAFELY WHEREVER HE WANTS TO GO
TILL THEY ARE QUITE DEAD AND HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT LOVE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY USED TO LIE IN SECRET WITH THE SUITORS ON THIS THE WOMEN CAME DOWN IN A BODY WEEPING AND WAILING BITTERLY FIRST
STAY YOUR HAND THEREFORE AND TELL YOUR FATHER OR HE WILL KILL ME IN HIS RAGE AGAINST THE SUITORS FOR HAVING WASTED HIS SUBSTANCE AND BEEN SO FOOLISHLY DISRESPECTFUL TO YOURSELF ULYSSES SMILED AT HIM AND ANSWERED
THEN TELEMACHUS SPOKE GREAT HEAVENS HE EXCLAIMED JOVE MUST HAVE ROBBED ME OF MY SENSES HERE IS MY DEAR AND EXCELLENT MOTHER SAYING SHE WILL QUIT THIS HOUSE AND MARRY AGAIN
SO SHE FLEW UP TO ONE OF THE RAFTERS IN THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER AND SAT UPON IT IN THE FORM OF A SWALLOW MEANWHILE
EITHER IN WORD OR DEED AND I TRIED TO STOP THE OTHERS I SAW THEM BUT THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN AND NOW THEY ARE PAYING FOR THEIR FOLLY I WAS THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST IF YOU KILL ME
THEY BENT HIS HANDS AND FEET WELL BEHIND HIS BACK
THE TWO FELL IN WITH ONE ANOTHER IN MESSENE AT THE HOUSE OF ORTILOCHUS
FOLLOWING TELEMACHUS SHE FOUND ULYSSES AMONG THE CORPSES BESPATTERED WITH BLOOD AND FILTH LIKE A LION THAT HAS JUST BEEN DEVOURING AN OX AND HIS BREAST AND BOTH HIS CHEEKS ARE ALL BLOODY
THEN THEY DRAGGED HIM THROUGH THE DOORWAY OUT OF THE HOUSE SO HE WENT AWAY CRAZED AND BORE THE BURDEN OF HIS CRIME BEREFT OF UNDERSTANDING HENCEFORTH THEREFORE THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN MANKIND AND THE CENTAURS
I SHALL DIE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT AND SHALL HAVE GOT NO THANKS FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT I DID ULYSSES LOOKED STERNLY AT HIM AND ANSWERED IF YOU WERE THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST YOU MUST HAVE PRAYED MANY A TIME
LOOKING FEARFULLY ROUND AND STILL EXPECTING THAT THEY WOULD BE KILLED THEN ULYSSES SEARCHED THE WHOLE COURT CAREFULLY OVER TO SEE IF ANYONE HAD MANAGED TO HIDE HIMSELF AND WAS STILL LIVING
THEY WASHED THEIR HANDS AND FEET AND WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE FOR ALL WAS NOW OVER
BUT KILLED HIM IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING AND KEPT THE MARES HIMSELF IT WAS WHEN CLAIMING THESE
WE WILL NOT LET YOUR SONS LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE NOR YOUR DAUGHTERS NOR SHALL YOUR WIDOW
HAS NOT VOUCHSAFED IT TO HIM HE WANTED TO KILL YOUR SON AND TO BE CHIEF MAN IN ITHACA NOW THEREFORE THAT HE HAS MET THE DEATH WHICH WAS HIS DUE SPARE THE LIVES OF YOUR PEOPLE
AND THE DART WENT CLEAN THROUGH HIM SO THAT HE FELL FORWARD FULL ON HIS FACE UPON THE GROUND THEN MINERVA FROM HER SEAT ON THE RAFTER
IF YOU ARE ULYSSES SAID HE THEN WHAT YOU HAVE SAID IS JUST WE HAVE DONE MUCH WRONG ON YOUR LANDS AND IN YOUR HOUSE
THEY CARRIED THE DEAD BODIES OUT AND PROPPED THEM UP AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN THE GATEHOUSE ULYSSES ORDERED THEM ABOUT AND MADE THEM DO THEIR WORK QUICKLY SO THEY HAD TO CARRY THE BODIES OUT
WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY CLEANED ALL THE TABLES AND SEATS WITH SPONGES AND WATER WHILE TELEMACHUS AND THE TWO OTHERS SHOVELLED UP THE BLOOD AND DIRT FROM THE GROUND AND THE WOMEN CARRIED IT ALL AWAY
TO MAKE THE SUITORS TRY THEIR SKILL WITH THE BOW AND WITH THE IRON AXES IN CONTEST AMONG THEMSELVES AS A MEANS OF BRINGING ABOUT THEIR DESTRUCTION SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND GOT THE STORE ROOM KEY WHICH WAS MADE OF BRONZE AND HAD A HANDLE OF IVORY
ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK SO THAT HIS HEAD FELL ROLLING IN THE DUST WHILE HE WAS YET SPEAKING
WHO KILLS EVERY ONE THAT COMES NEAR HIM YOU WILL NEVER GET AWAY ALIVE SO DRINK AND KEEP QUIET WITHOUT GETTING INTO A QUARREL WITH MEN YOUNGER THAN YOURSELF PENELOPE THEN SPOKE TO HIM
AS SHE SPOKE SHE TOLD EUMAEUS TO SET THE BOW AND THE PIECES OF IRON BEFORE THE SUITORS AND EUMAEUS WEPT AS HE TOOK THEM TO DO AS SHE HAD BIDDEN HIM HARD BY THE STOCKMAN WEPT ALSO
HE SAW FOR CERTAIN WHAT MIND THEY WERE OF ULYSSES SAID IT IS I ULYSSES WHO AM HERE I HAVE SUFFERED MUCH BUT AT LAST IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR I AM COME BACK TO MY OWN COUNTRY
SO EUMAEUS BROUGHT THE BOW ON AND PLACED IT IN THE HANDS OF ULYSSES WHEN HE HAD DONE THIS HE CALLED EURYCLEA APART AND SAID TO HER
OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE STILL FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES THEY WERE BY FAR THE MOST VALIANT FOR THE OTHERS HAD ALREADY FALLEN UNDER THE ARROWS OF ULYSSES
FROM HIS ARROWS LET US HAVE AT HIM WITH A RUSH TO DRIVE HIM FROM THE PAVEMENT AND DOORWAY WE CAN THEN GET THROUGH INTO THE TOWN AND RAISE SUCH AN ALARM AS SHALL SOON STAY HIS SHOOTING
THEN CAUGHT THE KNEES OF ULYSSES AND SAID ULYSSES I BESEECH YOU HAVE MERCY UPON ME AND SPARE ME
GO THEN WITHIN THE HOUSE AND BUSY YOURSELF WITH YOUR DAILY DUTIES YOUR LOOM YOUR DISTAFF AND THE ORDERING OF YOUR SERVANTS THIS BOW IS A MAN'S MATTER AND MINE ABOVE ALL OTHERS FOR IT IS I WHO AM MASTER HERE
FOR THE SWINEHERD AND THE STOCKMAN FOR WE HAD BETTER BE ARMED RUN AND FETCH THEM ANSWERED ULYSSES WHILE MY ARROWS HOLD OUT OR WHEN I AM ALONE THEY MAY GET ME AWAY FROM THE DOOR
MY FRIENDS THIS MAN WILL GIVE US NO QUARTER
THAT HE IS OF NOBLE BIRTH GIVE HIM THE BOW AND LET US SEE WHETHER HE CAN STRING IT OR NO I SAY AND IT SHALL SURELY BE THAT IF APOLLO
TELEMACHUS DID AS HIS FATHER SAID AND WENT OFF TO THE STORE ROOM WHERE THE ARMOUR WAS KEPT HE CHOSE FOUR SHIELDS EIGHT SPEARS AND FOUR BRASS HELMETS WITH HORSE HAIR PLUMES HE BROUGHT THEM WITH ALL SPEED TO HIS FATHER
FIERCE AND FULL OF FURY NEVERTHELESS THOSE WHO WERE IN THE BODY OF THE COURT WERE STILL BOTH BRAVE AND MANY THEN
LET ANOTHER HAVE IT THIS BOW SHALL TAKE THE LIFE AND SOUL OUT OF MANY A CHIEF AMONG US FOR IT IS BETTER TO DIE THAN TO LIVE AFTER HAVING MISSED THE PRIZE THAT WE HAVE SO LONG STRIVEN FOR AND WHICH HAS BROUGHT US SO LONG TOGETHER
FOR SOME GOD HAS BEEN SENDING HER TO SLEEP DO NOT WAKE HER YET ANSWERED ULYSSES BUT TELL THE WOMEN WHO HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES TO COME TO ME
LET US THEN SHOW FIGHT
SON OF DAMASTOR EURYNOMUS AMPHIMEDON DEMOPTOLEMUS PISANDER AND POLYBUS SON OF POLYCTOR BORE THE BRUNT OF THE FIGHT UPON THE SUITORS SIDE
DO NOT THEREFORE BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO CUT MY HEAD OFF YOUR OWN SON TELEMACHUS WILL TELL YOU THAT I DID NOT WANT TO FREQUENT YOUR HOUSE AND SING TO THE SUITORS AFTER THEIR MEALS BUT THEY WERE TOO MANY AND TOO STRONG FOR ME
MY FRIENDS HE WILL SOON HAVE TO LEAVE OFF FOR MENTOR HAS GONE AWAY AFTER HAVING DONE NOTHING FOR HIM BUT BRAG THEY ARE STANDING AT THE DOORS UNSUPPORTED DO NOT AIM AT HIM ALL AT ONCE
BENEATH WHICH HE HAD HIDDEN BY COVERING HIMSELF UP WITH A FRESHLY FLAYED HEIFER'S HIDE SO HE THREW OFF THE HIDE WENT UP TO TELEMACHUS AND LAID HOLD OF HIS KNEES HERE I AM MY DEAR SIR SAID HE
BUT HE FOUND THEM ALL LYING IN THE DUST AND WELTERING IN THEIR BLOOD THEY WERE LIKE FISHES WHICH FISHERMEN HAVE NETTED OUT OF THE SEA AND THROWN UPON THE BEACH TO LIE GASPING FOR WATER
OR KNOCK HIM DOWN SO HE SET OFF AT A RUN AND IMMEDIATELY WAS AT HIS FATHER'S SIDE THEN HE SAID FATHER LET ME BRING YOU A SHIELD TWO SPEARS AND A BRASS HELMET FOR YOUR TEMPLES
SOME ONE OF US IS EVEN NOW HOPING AND PRAYING THAT HE MAY MARRY PENELOPE BUT WHEN HE HAS SEEN THIS BOW AND TRIED IT LET HIM WOO AND MAKE BRIDAL OFFERINGS TO SOME OTHER WOMAN AND LET PENELOPE
I SHALL EITHER BE ALWAYS FEEBLE AND OF NO PROWESS OR I AM TOO YOUNG AND HAVE NOT YET REACHED MY FULL STRENGTH SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HOLD MY OWN IF ANY ONE ATTACKS ME YOU OTHERS THEREFORE WHO ARE STRONGER THAN I
BY KILLING US OUTRIGHT THEY THEREFORE AIMED STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM AND THREW THEIR SPEARS ULYSSES KILLED DEMOPTOLEMUS TELEMACHUS EURYADES EUMAEUS ELATUS
HELP WOULD COME AT ONCE AND WE SHOULD SOON MAKE AN END OF THIS MAN AND HIS SHOOTING THIS MAY NOT BE AGELAUS ANSWERED MELANTHIUS THE MOUTH OF THE NARROW PASSAGE IS DANGEROUSLY NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE OUTER COURT
WE WILL KILL YOU TOO YOU SHALL PAY FOR IT WITH YOUR HEAD AND WHEN WE HAVE KILLED YOU WE WILL TAKE ALL YOU HAVE IN DOORS OR OUT AND BRING IT INTO HOTCH POT WITH ULYSSES PROPERTY
THOUGH YOU SHOULD GIVE ME ALL THAT YOU HAVE IN THE WORLD BOTH NOW AND ALL THAT YOU EVER SHALL HAVE I WILL NOT STAY MY HAND TILL I HAVE PAID ALL OF YOU IN FULL YOU MUST FIGHT OR FLY FOR YOUR LIVES AND FLY
IF HEAVEN SHALL DELIVER THE SUITORS INTO MY HANDS I WILL FIND WIVES FOR BOTH OF YOU WILL GIVE YOU HOUSE AND HOLDING CLOSE TO MY OWN AND YOU SHALL BE TO ME AS THOUGH YOU WERE BROTHERS AND FRIENDS OF TELEMACHUS
IF APOLLO AND THE OTHER GODS WILL GRANT OUR PRAYER YOUR OWN BOARHOUNDS SHALL GET YOU INTO SOME QUIET LITTLE PLACE AND WORRY YOU TO DEATH EUMAEUS WAS FRIGHTENED AT THE OUTCRY THEY ALL RAISED
THERE IS NONE THAT IS MORE POWERFUL IN LEADING FEEBLE MINDS ASTRAY FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH OF VIRTUE
IT MAY BE BELIEVED WITHOUT DISCREDIT TO THE MIRACLE OF CREATION THAT IN THIS WAY ALONE THINGS PURELY MATERIAL MIGHT IN COURSE OF TIME
I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO REFRAIN FROM THIS EXPOSITION AND ONLY MENTION IN GENERAL WHAT THESE TRUTHS ARE THAT THE MORE JUDICIOUS MAY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MORE SPECIAL ACCOUNT OF THEM WOULD CONDUCE TO THE PUBLIC ADVANTAGE
BY THE FANTASY WHICH CAN CHANGE THEM IN VARIOUS WAYS AND OUT OF THEM COMPOSE NEW IDEAS AND WHICH BY THE SAME MEANS DISTRIBUTING THE ANIMAL SPIRITS THROUGH THE MUSCLES CAN CAUSE THE MEMBERS OF SUCH A BODY TO MOVE IN AS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN WERE IT NOT THAT THE BLOOD OF THE VENOUS ARTERY HAVING ONLY BEEN IN THE LUNGS AFTER IT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE HEART IS THINNER AND RAREFIES MORE READILY AND IN A HIGHER DEGREE
AND OF HAVING BEEN THE FIRST TO TEACH THAT THERE ARE MANY SMALL PASSAGES AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES THROUGH WHICH THE BLOOD RECEIVED BY THEM FROM THE HEART PASSES INTO THE SMALL BRANCHES OF THE VEINS
WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF THE BLOOD BE WITHDRAWN FROM ANY PART THE HEAT IS LIKEWISE WITHDRAWN BY THE SAME MEANS AND ALTHOUGH THE HEART WERE AS HOT AS GLOWING IRON IT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF WARMING THE FEET AND HANDS
I CAME NEXT TO SPEAK OF THE EARTH IN PARTICULAR AND TO SHOW HOW EVEN THOUGH I HAD EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT GOD HAD GIVEN NO WEIGHT TO THE MATTER OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THIS SHOULD NOT PREVENT ALL ITS PARTS FROM TENDING EXACTLY
SHOULD NOT IN THIS BE EQUAL TO THE MOST STUPID INFANT OF ITS KIND OR AT LEAST TO ONE THAT WAS CRACK BRAINED UNLESS THE SOUL OF BRUTES
AND FINALLY HOW FROM THESE ASHES
SO THAT ITS COURSE AMOUNTS PRECISELY TO A PERPETUAL CIRCULATION OF THIS WE HAVE ABUNDANT PROOF IN THE ORDINARY EXPERIENCE OF SURGEONS WHO BY BINDING THE ARM WITH A TIE OF MODERATE STRAITNESS ABOVE THE PART WHERE THEY OPEN THE VEIN
AND THERE FORM AS IT WERE TWO POUCHES DENOMINATED THE AURICLES OF THE HEART WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF A SUBSTANCE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE HEART ITSELF AND THAT THERE IS ALWAYS MORE WARMTH IN THE HEART THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE BODY
THE OPENING VERY TIGHT FOR IT IS MANIFEST THAT THE TIE MODERATELY STRAIGHTENED WHILE ADEQUATE TO HINDER THE BLOOD ALREADY IN THE ARM FROM RETURNING TOWARDS THE HEART BY THE VEINS CANNOT ON THAT ACCOUNT PREVENT NEW BLOOD
WAKING SLEEP AND DREAMS HOW LIGHT SOUNDS ODORS TASTES HEAT AND ALL THE OTHER QUALITIES OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS IMPRESS IT WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS BY MEANS OF THE SENSES HOW HUNGER
CAUSING IN THIS WAY ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND OF THE GRAND ARTERY TO EXPAND ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE HEART WHICH IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER BEGINS TO CONTRACT AS DO ALSO THE ARTERIES
TO SATISFY MYSELF IN A SHORT TIME ON ALL THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ARE USUALLY TREATED OF IN PHILOSOPHY BUT I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED CERTAIN LAWS ESTABLISHED IN NATURE BY GOD IN SUCH A MANNER
BUT LIKE THE PAINTERS WHO FINDING THEMSELVES UNABLE TO REPRESENT EQUALLY WELL ON A PLAIN SURFACE ALL THE DIFFERENT FACES OF A SOLID BODY SELECT ONE OF THE CHIEF ON WHICH ALONE THEY MAKE THE LIGHT FALL AND THROWING THE REST INTO THE SHADE
I WOULD HERE WILLINGLY HAVE PROCEEDED TO EXHIBIT THE WHOLE CHAIN OF TRUTHS WHICH I DEDUCED FROM THESE PRIMARY BUT AS WITH A VIEW TO THIS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY NOW TO TREAT OF MANY QUESTIONS
OF THE TWO VESSELS FROM WHICH THEY FLOW AND THUS PREVENT ANY MORE BLOOD FROM COMING DOWN INTO THE HEART AND BECOMING MORE AND MORE RAREFIED THEY PUSH OPEN THE SIX SMALL VALVES THAT ARE IN THE ORIFICES OF THE OTHER TWO VESSELS THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS OUT
FOR AFTER THESE THINGS IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING MORE WITH A VIEW TO EXPLAIN THE MOTION OF THE HEART EXCEPT THAT WHEN ITS CAVITIES ARE NOT FULL OF BLOOD
WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND I DID AFTERWARDS DISCOVER THESE AS SOON AS I SUPPOSED GOD TO HAVE CREATED A RATIONAL SOUL AND TO HAVE ANNEXED IT TO THIS BODY IN A PARTICULAR MANNER WHICH I DESCRIBED
ON ALL THE BODIES THAT ARE UPON THE EARTH SINCE THEY ARE EITHER COLORED OR TRANSPARENT OR LUMINOUS AND FINALLY ON MAN SINCE HE IS THE SPECTATOR OF THESE OBJECTS
WE COULD HAVE NO MEANS OF KNOWING THAT THEY WERE IN ANY RESPECT OF A DIFFERENT NATURE FROM THESE ANIMALS BUT IF THERE WERE MACHINES BEARING THE IMAGE OF OUR BODIES AND CAPABLE OF IMITATING OUR ACTIONS AS FAR AS IT IS MORALLY POSSIBLE
CAN NUMBER THE HOURS AND MEASURE TIME MORE EXACTLY THAN WE WITH ALL OUR SKIN I HAD AFTER THIS DESCRIBED THE REASONABLE SOUL AND SHOWN THAT IT COULD BY NO MEANS BE EDUCED FROM THE POWER OF MATTER
AND WE OUGHT NOT TO CONFOUND SPEECH WITH THE NATURAL MOVEMENTS WHICH INDICATE THE PASSIONS AND CAN BE IMITATED BY MACHINES AS WELL AS MANIFESTED BY ANIMALS NOR MUST IT BE THOUGHT WITH CERTAIN OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE BRUTES SPEAK ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE
AND IF ATTENTION BE GIVEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HEART
TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS WORLD HAD BEEN CREATED IN THE MANNER I DESCRIBED
MATTER SUFFICIENT TO COMPOSE ONE AND WERE TO AGITATE VARIOUSLY AND CONFUSEDLY THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS MATTER SO THAT THERE RESULTED A CHAOS AS DISORDERED AS THE POETS EVER FEIGNED
DESTITUTE OF THE ORGANS WHICH OTHERS USE IN SPEAKING ARE IN THE HABIT OF SPONTANEOUSLY INVENTING CERTAIN SIGNS BY WHICH THEY DISCOVER THEIR THOUGHTS TO THOSE WHO BEING USUALLY IN THEIR COMPANY HAVE LEISURE TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE
VENOUS ARTERY OPEN ANEW AND ALLOW A PASSAGE
AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT AFTER THIS LIFE WE HAVE NOTHING TO HOPE FOR OR FEAR MORE THAN FLIES AND ANTS IN PLACE OF WHICH WHEN WE KNOW HOW FAR THEY DIFFER WE MUCH BETTER COMPREHEND THE REASONS WHICH ESTABLISH
AND TO ACCEPT AS TRUE NOTHING THAT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME MORE CLEAR AND CERTAIN THAN THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE GEOMETERS HAD FORMERLY APPEARED AND YET I VENTURE TO STATE THAT NOT ONLY HAVE I FOUND MEANS
AND THERE OCCUPY THE PLACE OF SOME OTHERS EXPELLED BY THEM AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION SHAPE OR SMALLNESS OF THE PORES WITH WHICH THEY MEET SOME RATHER THAN OTHERS FLOW INTO CERTAIN PARTS
AND HOW THENCE IN AN INSTANT OF TIME IT TRAVERSES THE IMMENSE SPACES OF THE HEAVENS AND HOW FROM THE PLANETS AND COMETS IT IS REFLECTED TOWARDS THE EARTH TO THIS I LIKEWISE ADDED MUCH RESPECTING THE SUBSTANCE THE SITUATION THE MOTIONS
SO AS TO PREVENT THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE BLOOD FLOWING OUT OF IT COULD COME FROM ANY OTHER QUARTER THAN THE HEART BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EVINCE THAT WHAT I HAVE ALLEGED
WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IT IS DISTILLED BY PASSING AND REPASSING THROUGH THE HEART PERHAPS MORE THAN ONE OR TWO HUNDRED TIMES IN A DAY
IT THENCE HAPPENS THAT THEIR MOTION IS THE CONTRARY OF THAT OF THE HEART AND THAT WHEN IT EXPANDS THEY CONTRACT BUT LEST THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT OF THE FORCE OF MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATIONS AND WHO ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DISTINGUISH
FEARING LEST I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPENSE IN MY DISCOURSE ALL THAT WAS IN MY MIND I RESOLVED TO EXPOUND SINGLY THOUGH AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH MY OPINIONS REGARDING LIGHT THEN
TO THAT OBSERVED IN OUR SEAS AS ALSO A CERTAIN CURRENT BOTH OF WATER AND AIR FROM EAST TO WEST SUCH AS IS LIKEWISE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TROPICS HOW THE MOUNTAINS SEAS FOUNTAINS AND RIVERS MIGHT NATURALLY BE FORMED IN IT
AS CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SUPPOSITION EXIST IN THIS BODY I FOUND PRECISELY ALL THOSE WHICH MAY EXIST IN US INDEPENDENTLY
TO THE HAND WITH GREATER FORCE THAN IT DOES TO RETURN FROM THE HAND TO THE HEART THROUGH THE VEINS AND SINCE THE LATTER CURRENT ESCAPES FROM THE ARM BY THE OPENING MADE IN ONE OF THE VEINS THERE MUST OF NECESSITY
FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF INANIMATE BODIES AND PLANTS I PASSED TO ANIMALS AND PARTICULARLY TO MAN
TWO OTHERS AT THE MOUTH OF THE VENOUS ARTERY WHICH ALLOW THE BLOOD FROM THE LUNGS TO FLOW INTO THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART BUT PRECLUDE ITS RETURN AND THREE AT THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH SUFFER THE BLOOD TO FLOW FROM THE HEART
OF THE SAME MATTER WITH THAT I HAD DESCRIBED AND AT FIRST PLACED IN IT NO RATIONAL SOUL NOR ANY OTHER PRINCIPLE IN ROOM OF THE VEGETATIVE OR SENSITIVE SOUL BEYOND KINDLING IN THE HEART ONE OF THOSE FIRES WITHOUT LIGHT
FROM COMING FORWARD THROUGH THE ARTERIES BECAUSE THESE ARE SITUATED BELOW THE VEINS AND THEIR COVERINGS FROM THEIR GREATER CONSISTENCY ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO COMPRESS AND ALSO THAT THE BLOOD WHICH COMES FROM THE HEART TENDS TO PASS THROUGH THEM
AND ADEQUATE TO MOVEMENTS MORE ADMIRABLE THAN IS ANY MACHINE OF HUMAN INVENTION AND HERE I SPECIALLY STAYED TO SHOW THAT WERE THERE SUCH MACHINES EXACTLY RESEMBLING ORGANS AND OUTWARD FORM AN APE OR ANY OTHER IRRATIONAL ANIMAL
CAUSE THE BLOOD TO FLOW MORE COPIOUSLY THAN IT WOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT ANY LIGATURE WHEREAS QUITE THE CONTRARY WOULD HAPPEN WERE THEY TO BIND IT BELOW THAT IS BETWEEN THE HAND AND THE OPENING OR WERE TO MAKE THE LIGATURE ABOVE
WHICH BY BEING VARIOUSLY PERFORATED SERVE TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF GRAIN AND IN THE LAST PLACE WHAT ABOVE ALL IS HERE WORTHY OF OBSERVATION
I SHOULD WISH ALSO THAT SUCH PERSONS WERE CAREFULLY SHOWN THE ELEVEN PELLICLES WHICH LIKE SO MANY SMALL VALVES OPEN AND SHUT THE FOUR ORIFICES THAT ARE IN THESE TWO CAVITIES VIZ
I HAVE EVER REMAINED FIRM IN MY ORIGINAL RESOLUTION TO SUPPOSE NO OTHER PRINCIPLE THAN THAT OF WHICH I HAVE RECENTLY AVAILED MYSELF IN DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND OF THE SOUL
I EXPOUNDED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH WHAT THE NATURE OF THAT LIGHT MUST BE
SO THAT EVEN ALTHOUGH HE HAD FROM THE BEGINNING GIVEN IT NO OTHER FORM THAN THAT OF CHAOS PROVIDED ONLY HE HAD ESTABLISHED CERTAIN LAWS OF NATURE AND HAD LENT IT HIS CONCURRENCE TO ENABLE IT TO ACT AS IT IS WONT TO DO
AND COULD SURPASS US IN ALL THINGS ON THE CONTRARY IT RATHER PROVES THAT THEY ARE DESTITUTE OF REASON AND THAT IT IS NATURE WHICH ACTS IN THEM ACCORDING TO THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR ORGANS THUS IT IS SEEN THAT A CLOCK COMPOSED ONLY OF WHEELS AND WEIGHTS
FROM THE VERY ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WHICH MAY BE OBSERVED IN THE HEART BY THE EYE ALONE AND FROM THE HEAT WHICH MAY BE FELT WITH THE FINGERS AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE BLOOD AS LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE AS DOES THE MOTION OF A CLOCK FROM THE POWER
THIRST AND THE OTHER INTERNAL AFFECTIONS CAN LIKEWISE IMPRESS UPON IT DIVERS IDEAS WHAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE COMMON SENSE SENSUS COMMUNIS IN WHICH THESE IDEAS ARE RECEIVED BY THE MEMORY WHICH RETAINS THEM
AND THE SIX SMALL VALVES CLOSE AND THE FIVE OF THE HOLLOW
CONSISTS IN THINKING FUNCTIONS IN WHICH THE ANIMALS VOID OF REASON MAY BE SAID WHOLLY TO RESEMBLE US BUT AMONG WHICH I COULD NOT DISCOVER ANY OF THOSE THAT AS DEPENDENT ON THOUGHT ALONE BELONG TO US AS MEN
IS THE GENERATION OF THE ANIMAL SPIRITS WHICH ARE LIKE A VERY SUBTLE WIND OR RATHER A VERY PURE AND VIVID FLAME WHICH
AND TO HAVE SHOWN TO THEM ITS TWO VENTRICLES OR CAVITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WITH WHICH CORRESPOND TWO VERY AMPLE TUBES VIZ THE HOLLOW VEIN VENA CAVA
INTO THESE THE BLOOD OF NECESSITY FLOWS FROM THE HOLLOW VEIN INTO THE RIGHT AND FROM THE VENOUS ARTERY INTO THE LEFT BECAUSE THESE TWO VESSELS ARE ALWAYS FULL OF BLOOD AND THEIR ORIFICES WHICH ARE TURNED TOWARDS THE HEART CANNOT THEN BE CLOSED
PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BRAIN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN SIMPLY THAT THE ARTERIES WHICH CARRY THEM THITHER PROCEED FROM THE HEART
AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE DIFFERENT HUMORS OF THE BODY BEYOND SAYING THAT THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE BLOOD IN BEING RAREFIED PASSES FROM THE HEART TOWARDS THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES CAUSES CERTAIN OF ITS PARTS TO REMAIN IN THE MEMBERS AT WHICH THEY ARRIVE
TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDING SOMETHING ON THE SUN AND THE FIXED STARS SINCE LIGHT ALMOST WHOLLY PROCEEDS FROM THEM ON THE HEAVENS SINCE THEY TRANSMIT IT ON THE PLANETS COMETS AND EARTH SINCE THEY REFLECT IT AND PARTICULARLY
THE SITUATION AND SHAPE OF ITS COUNTERWEIGHTS AND WHEELS BUT IF IT BE ASKED HOW IT HAPPENS THAT THE BLOOD IN THE VEINS FLOWING IN THIS WAY CONTINUALLY INTO THE HEART IS NOT EXHAUSTED
BECAUSE NO OTHER CAUSES ARE OBSERVED CAPABLE OF DESTROYING IT
WILL AFFORD THE MEANS OF READILY DETERMINING WHAT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF ALL THE REST
BUT THIS IS CERTAIN AND AN OPINION COMMONLY RECEIVED AMONG THEOLOGIANS THAT THE ACTION BY WHICH HE NOW SUSTAINS IT IS THE SAME WITH THAT BY WHICH HE ORIGINALLY CREATED IT
FOR EXAMPLE IF TOUCHED IN A PARTICULAR PLACE IT MAY DEMAND WHAT WE WISH TO SAY TO IT IF IN ANOTHER IT MAY CRY OUT THAT IT IS HURT AND SUCH LIKE
OUR THOUGHTS TO OTHERS FOR WE MAY EASILY CONCEIVE A MACHINE TO BE SO CONSTRUCTED THAT IT EMITS VOCABLES AND EVEN THAT IT EMITS SOME CORRESPONDENT TO THE ACTION UPON IT OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS WHICH CAUSE A CHANGE IN ITS ORGANS
WHICH ARRANGED IN A MANNER EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE FORMER READILY PERMIT THE BLOOD CONTAINED IN THIS CAVITY TO PASS INTO THE LUNGS BUT HINDER THAT CONTAINED IN THE LUNGS FROM RETURNING TO THIS CAVITY AND IN LIKE MANNER
TWO CANALS IN SIZE EQUAL TO OR LARGER THAN THE PRECEDING VIZ THE VENOUS ARTERY ARTERIA VENOSA LIKEWISE INAPPROPRIATELY THUS DESIGNATED BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY A VEIN WHICH COMES FROM THE LUNGS
ASCENDING IN GREAT ABUNDANCE FROM THE HEART TO THE BRAIN THENCE PENETRATES THROUGH THE NERVES INTO THE MUSCLES AND GIVES MOTION TO ALL THE MEMBERS SO THAT TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE BLOOD WHICH AS MOST AGITATED AND PENETRATING
NATURE MUST PRODUCE THEM I REMAINED SATISFIED WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT GOD FORMED THE BODY OF MAN WHOLLY LIKE TO ONE OF OURS AS WELL IN THE EXTERNAL SHAPE OF THE MEMBERS AS IN THE INTERNAL CONFORMATION OF THE ORGANS
IN PARTS MORE REMOTE FROM IT IN THE NEXT PLACE
SUFFICIENTLY SHOWS THAT THE BLOOD IS IMPELLED AGAINST THEM WITH MORE FORCE THAN AGAINST THE VEINS AND WHY SHOULD THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART
AND ALL THE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF THESE HEAVENS AND STARS SO THAT I THOUGHT I HAD SAID ENOUGH RESPECTING THEM TO SHOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING OBSERVABLE IN THE HEAVENS OR STARS OF OUR SYSTEM THAT MUST NOT OR AT LEAST MAY NOT APPEAR PRECISELY ALIKE IN THOSE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH I DESCRIBED
THESE ORGANS ON THE CONTRARY NEED A PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR ACTION WHENCE IT MUST BE MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD EXIST IN ANY MACHINE A DIVERSITY OF ORGANS SUFFICIENT
IN THE MOST DIRECT LINES AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MECHANICS WHICH ARE THE SAME WITH THOSE OF NATURE WHEN MANY OBJECTS TEND AT ONCE TO THE SAME POINT
I ENDEAVORED TO DEMONSTRATE ALL THOSE ABOUT WHICH THERE COULD BE ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT
TO GIVE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS CONTAINED IN IT THE POWER TO MOVE THE MEMBERS AS WHEN WE SEE HEADS SHORTLY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK OFF STILL MOVE AND BITE THE EARTH ALTHOUGH NO LONGER ANIMATED WHAT CHANGES MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE BRAIN TO PRODUCE
WHICH FLOW FORTH FROM THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART AND TEND TOWARDS THE BRAIN THE WEAKER AND LESS AGITATED PARTS MUST NECESSARILY BE DRIVEN ASIDE FROM THAT POINT BY THE STRONGER WHICH ALONE IN THIS WAY REACH IT
THREE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE HOLLOW VEINS WHERE THEY ARE DISPOSED IN SUCH A MANNER AS BY NO MEANS TO PREVENT THE BLOOD WHICH IT CONTAINS FROM FLOWING INTO THE RIGHT VENTRICLE OF THE HEART AND YET EXACTLY TO PREVENT ITS FLOWING OUT THREE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE ARTERIAL VEIN
THAT THERE ARE NO MEN SO DULL AND STUPID NOT EVEN IDIOTS AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF JOINING TOGETHER DIFFERENT WORDS AND THEREBY CONSTRUCTING A DECLARATION BY WHICH TO MAKE THEIR THOUGHTS UNDERSTOOD
BUT PREVENT ITS REFLUX NOR DO WE NEED TO SEEK ANY OTHER REASON FOR THE NUMBER OF THESE PELLICLES BEYOND THIS THAT THE ORIFICE OF THE VENOUS ARTERY BEING OF AN OVAL SHAPE FROM THE NATURE OF ITS SITUATION CAN BE ADEQUATELY CLOSED WITH TWO
AND AFTER THAT DID NOTHING MORE THAN LEND HIS ORDINARY CONCURRENCE TO NATURE AND ALLOW HER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED ON THIS SUPPOSITION I IN THE FIRST PLACE DESCRIBED THIS MATTER
AS TO PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF HEAVENS HOW IN THE MEANTIME SOME OF ITS PARTS MUST COMPOSE AN EARTH AND SOME PLANETS AND COMETS AND OTHERS A SUN AND FIXED STARS AND MAKING A DIGRESSION AT THIS STAGE ON THE SUBJECT OF LIGHT
I HAD EXPOUNDED ALL THESE MATTERS WITH SUFFICIENT MINUTENESS IN THE TREATISE WHICH I FORMERLY THOUGHT OF PUBLISHING AND AFTER THESE I HAD SHOWN WHAT MUST BE THE FABRIC OF THE NERVES AND MUSCLES OF THE HUMAN BODY
TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF GETTING DISSECTED IN THEIR PRESENCE THE HEART OF SOME LARGE ANIMAL POSSESSED OF LUNGS
BUT SINCE I HAD NOT AS YET SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE TO ENABLE ME TO TREAT OF THESE IN THE SAME MANNER AS OF THE REST THAT IS TO SAY BY DEDUCING EFFECTS FROM THEIR CAUSES AND BY SHOWING
TO THOSE WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE VARIETY OF MOVEMENTS PERFORMED BY THE DIFFERENT AUTOMATA OR MOVING MACHINES FABRICATED BY HUMAN INDUSTRY AND THAT WITH HELP OF BUT FEW PIECES COMPARED WITH THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF BONES
WHICH IS IN THE BODY MAY FLOW OUT OF IT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THROUGH A SINGLE ARTERY THAT HAS BEEN CUT
WHERE IT IS DIVIDED INTO MANY BRANCHES INTERLACED WITH THOSE OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND THOSE OF THE TUBE CALLED THE WINDPIPE THROUGH WHICH THE AIR WE BREATHE ENTERS AND THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH ISSUING FROM THE HEART SENDS ITS BRANCHES ALL OVER THE BODY
ARE IMMEDIATELY RAREFIED AND DILATED BY THE HEAT THEY MEET WITH IN THIS WAY THEY CAUSE THE WHOLE HEART TO EXPAND AND AT THE SAME TIME PRESS HOME AND SHUT THE FIVE SMALL VALVES THAT ARE AT THE ENTRANCES
AND THE METALS PRODUCED IN THE MINES AND THE PLANTS GROW IN THE FIELDS AND IN GENERAL HOW ALL THE BODIES WHICH ARE COMMONLY DENOMINATED MIXED OR COMPOSITE MIGHT BE GENERATED AND AMONG OTHER THINGS IN THE DISCOVERIES ALLUDED TO
APPOSITELY TO REPLY TO WHAT IS SAID IN ITS PRESENCE AS MEN OF THE LOWEST GRADE OF INTELLECT CAN DO THE SECOND TEST IS THAT ALTHOUGH SUCH MACHINES MIGHT EXECUTE MANY THINGS WITH EQUAL OR PERHAPS GREATER PERFECTION THAN ANY OF US
FOR I EVEN EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT IT POSSESSED NONE OF THOSE FORMS OR QUALITIES WHICH ARE SO DEBATED IN THE SCHOOLS NOR IN GENERAL ANYTHING THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH IS NOT SO NATURAL TO OUR MINDS
PRESENTLY DISPERSE THEMSELVES ALL OVER THE LUNGS IN THE SECOND PLACE THE CAVITY IN THE LEFT SIDE
AS THE OTHER THINGS OF WHICH I HAD SPOKEN BUT THAT IT MUST BE EXPRESSLY CREATED AND THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT IT BE LODGED IN THE HUMAN BODY EXACTLY LIKE A PILOT IN A SHIP UNLESS PERHAPS TO MOVE ITS MEMBERS
AND WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAT IN HAY THAT HAS BEEN HEAPED TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS DRY OR THAT WHICH CAUSES FERMENTATION IN NEW WINES BEFORE THEY ARE RUN CLEAR OF THE FRUIT FOR WHEN I EXAMINED THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS WHICH MIGHT
THAT THOUGH THERE ARE MANY ANIMALS WHICH MANIFEST MORE INDUSTRY THAN WE IN CERTAIN OF THEIR ACTIONS THE SAME ANIMALS ARE YET OBSERVED TO SHOW NONE AT ALL IN MANY OTHERS SO THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY DO BETTER
AND SINCE A CERTAIN INEQUALITY OF CAPACITY IS OBSERVABLE AMONG ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS WELL AS AMONG MEN AND SINCE SOME ARE MORE CAPABLE OF BEING INSTRUCTED THAN OTHERS IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE MOST PERFECT APE OR PARROT OF ITS SPECIES
IS THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE MOTION OF THE BLOOD THUS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE BLOOD WHICH FLOWS FROM THE VEINS AND THAT FROM THE ARTERIES CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THIS
FOR AS THIS TRANSMUTATION OF ASHES INTO GLASS APPEARED TO ME AS WONDERFUL AS ANY OTHER IN NATURE I TOOK A SPECIAL PLEASURE IN DESCRIBING IT I WAS NOT HOWEVER DISPOSED FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL RECEPTACLE OF THE BLOOD AND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AS IT WERE OF WHICH ALL THE OTHER VEINS IN THE BODY ARE BRANCHES AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN VENA ARTERIOSA INAPPROPRIATELY SO DENOMINATED
TRUE REASONS FROM MERE VERISIMILITUDES SHOULD VENTURE WITHOUT EXAMINATION TO DENY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID I WISH IT TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THE MOTION WHICH I HAVE NOW EXPLAINED FOLLOWS AS NECESSARILY
THAT EVEN IF GOD HAD CREATED MORE WORLDS THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NONE IN WHICH THESE LAWS WERE NOT OBSERVED THEREAFTER I SHOWED HOW THE GREATEST PART OF THE MATTER OF THIS CHAOS MUST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE LAWS DISPOSE AND ARRANGE ITSELF IN SUCH A WAY
WHEREAS THE OTHERS BEING ROUND ARE MORE CONVENIENTLY CLOSED WITH THREE BESIDES I WISH SUCH PERSONS TO OBSERVE THAT THE GRAND ARTERY AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN ARE OF MUCH HARDER AND FIRMER TEXTURE
I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT FIRE WHICH PRODUCES LIGHT I SPARED NO PAINS TO SET FORTH ALL THAT PERTAINS TO ITS NATURE THE MANNER OF ITS PRODUCTION AND SUPPORT AND TO EXPLAIN HOW HEAT IS SOMETIMES FOUND WITHOUT LIGHT AND LIGHT WITHOUT HEAT
AND THIS PROVES NOT ONLY THAT THE BRUTES HAVE LESS REASON THAN MAN BUT THAT THEY HAVE NONE AT ALL FOR WE SEE THAT VERY LITTLE IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE A PERSON TO SPEAK
AND OF WHICH HE HAS IMPRESSED ON OUR MINDS SUCH NOTIONS THAT AFTER WE HAVE REFLECTED SUFFICIENTLY UPON THESE WE CANNOT DOUBT THAT THEY ARE ACCURATELY OBSERVED IN ALL THAT EXISTS OR TAKES PLACE IN THE WORLD AND FARTHER BY CONSIDERING
BUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE JOINED AND UNITED MORE CLOSELY TO THE BODY IN ORDER TO HAVE SENSATIONS AND APPETITES SIMILAR TO OURS AND THUS CONSTITUTE A REAL MAN
WHICH CAUSE THE HEART AND THE ARTERIES AGAIN TO EXPAND AS BEFORE AND BECAUSE THE BLOOD WHICH THUS ENTERS INTO THE HEART PASSES
MUSCLES NERVES ARTERIES VEINS AND OTHER PARTS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE BODY OF EACH ANIMAL SUCH PERSONS WILL LOOK UPON THIS BODY AS A MACHINE MADE BY THE HANDS OF GOD WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER ARRANGED
AND MORE VIVID AND WARMER IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE HEART IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IN THE ARTERIES THAN IT WAS A SHORT TIME BEFORE PASSING INTO EITHER IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IT WAS IN THE VEINS
FURTHER TO ENABLE ME TO CAST THIS VARIETY OF SUBJECTS SOMEWHAT INTO THE SHADE AND TO EXPRESS MY JUDGMENT REGARDING THEM WITH GREATER FREEDOM WITHOUT BEING NECESSITATED TO ADOPT OR REFUTE THE OPINIONS OF THE LEARNED
TO SHOW HOW IT CAN INDUCE VARIOUS COLORS UPON DIFFERENT BODIES AND OTHER DIVERSE QUALITIES HOW IT REDUCES SOME TO A LIQUID STATE AND HARDENS OTHERS HOW IT CAN CONSUME ALMOST ALL BODIES OR CONVERT THEM INTO ASHES AND SMOKE
AND ESSAYED TO REPRESENT IT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT TO MY MIND THERE CAN BE NOTHING CLEARER AND MORE INTELLIGIBLE EXCEPT WHAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY SAID REGARDING GOD AND THE SOUL
AND THAT IN CHILDREN WHO CANNOT USE THEM WHILE IN THE WOMB
AND FINALLY THAT THIS HEAT IS CAPABLE OF CAUSING ANY DROP OF BLOOD THAT PASSES INTO THE CAVITIES RAPIDLY TO EXPAND AND DILATE JUST AS ALL LIQUORS DO WHEN ALLOWED TO FALL DROP BY DROP INTO A HIGHLY HEATED VESSEL
SINCE THEY ARE ENDOWED WITH MANY ORGANS ANALOGOUS TO OURS THEY COULD AS EASILY COMMUNICATE THEIR THOUGHTS TO US AS TO THEIR FELLOWS
BECAUSE THE ORIFICES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS ARE WIDE
THEN I AM REALLY IN DANGER DECLARED HIS MAJESTY POSITIVELY AND IT WILL BE WISE FOR ME TO CONSIDER A MEANS TO ESCAPE
DOCTOR NIKIDIK'S FAMOUS WISHING PILLS THE TIN WOODMAN WAS USUALLY A PEACEFUL MAN BUT WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED HE COULD FIGHT AS FIERCELY AS A ROMAN GLADIATOR
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU ARE HERE THAT TERRIBLE SAW HORSE RAN AWAY WITH ME I SUSPECTED IT SAID TIP DID YOU GET HURT ARE YOU CRACKED AT ALL
AND THE PAINTED SACK THAT SERVED HIM FOR A HEAD WAS CAREFULLY LAUNDERED AND RESTUFFED WITH THE BRAINS ORIGINALLY GIVEN HIM BY THE GREAT WIZARD HIS CLOTHES WERE ALSO CLEANED AND PRESSED BY THE IMPERIAL TAILORS AND HIS CROWN POLISHED AND AGAIN SEWED UPON HIS HEAD
AND WE WILL MAKE A DASH TO LIBERTY OR TO DEATH THE COURTYARD IN WHICH THEY WERE STANDING WAS LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PALACE WHICH SURROUNDED IT ON ALL SIDES BUT IN ONE PLACE A PASSAGE LED TO AN OUTER GATEWAY
THE CHILL NIGHTS RENDERED ME STIFF AND MOTIONLESS FOR I WORE NO CLOTHING BUT EACH MORNING THE WARM RAYS OF THE SUN GAVE ME NEW LIFE AND RESTORED ME TO ACTIVITY
AND THE ENGRAVED OIL CAN I BEGIN TO THINK
THE SOLDIER HASTENED TO DO THIS WHILE TIP WHO HAD ARRIVED AT HIS HEELS REMAINED IN THE COURTYARD TO LOOK AT THE SCARECROW WITH WONDERING EYES HIS MAJESTY CONTINUED TO THROW THE QUOITS
COVERING TIP AND THE WOGGLE BUG AND JACK'S PUMPKIN HEAD AND BEGAN TEARING IT AWAY AND FLYING OFF WITH IT ONLY TO LET IT DROP STRAW BY STRAW INTO THE GREAT GULF BENEATH THE SCARECROW'S HEAD NOTING WITH DISMAY THIS WANTON DESTRUCTION OF HIS INTERIOR
DON'T MENTION THAT TO THE TIN WOODMAN EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW EARNESTLY YOU WOULD HURT HIS FEELINGS TERRIBLY HE IS A PROUD MAN AS HE HAS EVERY REASON TO BE AND IT PLEASES HIM TO BE TERMED EMPEROR RATHER THAN KING
YES SAID TIP
THE COWARDLY LION AND THE SCARECROW THE LINES OF THE ENGRAVING BEING TRACED UPON THE SILVER IN YELLOW GOLD ON THE WALLS HUNG SEVERAL PORTRAITS
NOR WAS THE SAW HORSE ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THE OPERATION EITHER FOR HE GROWLED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT BEING BUTCHERED AS HE CALLED IT AND AFTERWARD DECLARED THAT THE NEW LEG WAS A DISGRACE TO A RESPECTABLE SAW HORSE
HOW ABOUT THESE WISHING PILLS ENQUIRED THE SCARECROW TAKING THE BOX FROM HIS JACKET POCKET CAN'T WE USE THEM TO ESCAPE NOT UNLESS WE CAN COUNT SEVENTEEN BY TWOS ANSWERED THE TIN WOODMAN
BUT TELL ME HOW CAME YOUR MAJESTY HERE AND WHO ARE YOUR COMPANIONS THE SCARECROW WITH GREAT POLITENESS INTRODUCED TIP AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND THE LATTER PERSONAGE SEEMED TO INTEREST THE TIN WOODMAN GREATLY
REPLIED THE SOLDIER STILL PALE WITH FEAR BUT WHERE WAS MY STANDING ARMY AT THE TIME INQUIRED HIS MAJESTY LOOKING AT THE SOLDIER GRAVELY YOUR STANDING ARMY WAS RUNNING ANSWERED THE FELLOW HONESTLY
BUT IN A KINDLY SYMPATHETIC TONE DO NOT I BEG OF YOU DAMPEN TODAY'S SUN WITH THE SHOWERS OF TOMORROW FOR BEFORE YOUR HEAD HAS TIME TO SPOIL YOU CAN HAVE IT CANNED AND IN THAT WAY IT MAY BE PRESERVED INDEFINITELY
YES ANSWERED THE TIN WOODMAN BUT OUR FRIEND'S CLOTHES ARE USELESS WITHOUT STUFFING WHY NOT STUFF HIM WITH MONEY
AH THEN YOU WOULD NOT BE FIT TO ASSOCIATE WITH RETURNED THE SCARECROW THE MATTER IS MORE SERIOUS THAN I SUSPECTED YOU SAID THE PUMPKINHEAD GLOOMILY
SO HE BEGGED HIS FRIENDS TO EXCUSE HIM WHILE HE RETIRED TO HIS PRIVATE APARTMENT AND ALLOWED HIS SERVANTS TO POLISH HIM THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN A SHORT TIME AND WHEN THE EMPEROR RETURNED HIS NICKEL PLATED BODY SHONE SO MAGNIFICENTLY
THE INVADING ARMY ENTERED THE CITY MORE SLOWLY FOR THEY STOPPED TO DIG EMERALDS OUT OF THE WALLS AND PAVING STONES WITH THE POINTS OF THEIR KNITTING NEEDLES SO THE SOLDIER AND THE BOY REACHED THE PALACE BEFORE THE NEWS HAD SPREAD THAT THE CITY WAS CONQUERED
YOUR MAJESTY THE CITY IS CONQUERED GASPED THE ROYAL ARMY WHO WAS ALL OUT OF BREATH THIS IS QUITE SUDDEN SAID THE SCARECROW BUT PLEASE GO AND BAR ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS OF THE PALACE WHILE I SHOW THIS PUMPKINHEAD HOW TO THROW A QUOIT
I MUST HAVE LIVED FULLY THREE YEARS IN THAT SECLUDED SCHOOL HOUSE HEARTH SAID HE DRINKING THIRSTILY OF THE EVER FLOWING FOUNT OF LIMPID KNOWLEDGE BEFORE ME QUITE POETICAL
I HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN HIS POWERS STILL HE CAN RUN
BUT OUR FRIEND THE WOGGLE BUG CLAIMS TO BE HIGHLY EDUCATED SO HE OUGHT EASILY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT CAN BE DONE IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF EDUCATION
I RESOLVED TO ESTABLISH MY FUTURE HOME BESIDE IT SO I FOUND A CHARMING NEST BETWEEN TWO BRICKS AND HID MYSELF THEREIN FOR MANY MANY MONTHS
AND THEY FLED SCREAMING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WHEN THE LAST FOE HAD DISAPPEARED TIP CRAWLED FROM UNDER THE SOFAS AND ASSISTED THE WOGGLE BUG TO FOLLOW HIM
NONSENSE EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW THEY'RE TOO BUSY TO COOK EVEN IF THEY KNOW HOW BUT SHOULD I REMAIN HERE A PRISONER FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME PROTESTED JACK I'M LIABLE TO SPOIL
GET TO WORK MY DEAR NICK AND FIT THE PUMPKINHEAD'S LEG TO THE SAW HORSE JACK WAS NOT ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THIS IDEA BUT HE SUBMITTED TO HAVING HIS LEFT LEG AMPUTATED BY THE TIN WOODMAN AND WHITTLED DOWN TO FIT THE LEFT LEG OF THE SAW HORSE
AND ARE RUNNING THINGS TO SUIT THEMSELVES DEAR ME WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY IDEA CRIED THE EMPEROR WHO WAS BOTH SHOCKED
THE SCARECROW PLANS AN ESCAPE TIP SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE GIRLS AND FOLLOWED SWIFTLY AFTER THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS
THEY SURELY DO NOT COMPLAIN OF YOUR WISE AND GRACIOUS RULE NO BUT THEY SAY IT IS A POOR RULE THAT DON'T WORK BOTH WAYS ANSWERED THE SCARECROW AND THESE FEMALES ARE ALSO OF THE OPINION THAT MEN HAVE RULED THE LAND LONG ENOUGH
RETURNED NICK WELL PLEASED MY HEART IS QUITE THE BEST PART OF ME BUT NOW LET US START UPON OUR JOURNEY THEY PERCHED THE ONE LEGGED PUMPKINHEAD UPON THE SAW HORSE AND TIED HIM TO HIS SEAT WITH CORDS
WHICH SMARTED FOR AN HOUR AFTERWARD BUT THE NEEDLES HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE SCARECROW OR JACK PUMPKINHEAD WHO NEVER EVEN SUSPECTED THEY WERE BEING PRODDED AS FOR THE SAW HORSE HE MADE A WONDERFUL RECORD UPSETTING A FRUIT CART
I'M SURE THE EMPEROR WILL RECEIVE US EVEN IN HIS PRESENT STATE THE EMPEROR'S STATE IS ALWAYS MAGNIFICENT SAID THE MAN
SCARECROW BECAME GREATLY ANIMATED AT THIS SIGHT AND EXCLAIMED HOW DELIGHTED I SHALL BE TO SEE MY OLD FRIEND THE TIN WOODMAN AGAIN
OBJECTED TIP NO BUT HE MAY BE INDUCED TO CARRY THREE SAID HIS MAJESTY I SHALL THEREFORE LEAVE MY ROYAL ARMY BEHIND FOR FROM THE EASE WITH WHICH HE WAS CONQUERED
TO THAT OF HIS COMRADE DEAR ME SAID THE SCARECROW DOLEFULLY WHAT A MESS I'M IN NEVER MIND MY FRIEND RETURNED THE TIN WOODMAN I'LL SEND YOU TO MY IMPERIAL LAUNDRY AND YOU'LL COME OUT AS GOOD AS NEW
IF YOU'LL KEEP QUIET LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO THINK I'LL TRY TO FIND SOME WAY FOR US ALL TO ESCAPE
WHY THE THREE PILLS ARE IN THE BOX AGAIN SAID THE SCARECROW OF COURSE THEY ARE THE WOGGLE BUG DECLARED
UNTIL THEY DREW UP BESIDE THE PALACE STEPS AN AGED WINKIE DRESSED IN A UNIFORM OF SILVER CLOTH CAME FORWARD TO ASSIST THEM TO ALIGHT SAID THE SCARECROW TO HIS PERSONAGE SHOW US AT ONCE TO YOUR MASTER THE EMPEROR
THAT THE SCARECROW HEARTILY CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS IMPROVED APPEARANCE THAT NICKEL PLATE WAS I CONFESS A HAPPY THOUGHT SAID NICK
WHO WERE MORE FRIGHTENED THAN HURT OFF THE GROUND AND THE PUPILS CLUSTERED AROUND HIM CLOSELY GROUPED I CALMLY WALKED OUT OF THE SCHOOL HOUSE TURNED A CORNER AND ESCAPED UNNOTICED
ARE YOUR SUBJECTS HAPPY AND CONTENTED MY DEAR FRIEND I CANNOT SAY WAS THE REPLY FOR THE GIRLS OF OZ HAVE RISEN IN REVOLT AND DRIVEN ME OUT OF THE EMERALD CITY GREAT GOODNESS CRIED THE TIN WOODMAN WHAT A CALAMITY
THERE REMAINED SO LITTLE SPACE FOR THE KING THAT HE WAS LIABLE TO FALL OFF AS SOON AS THE HORSE STARTED FETCH A CLOTHESLINE SAID THE KING TO HIS ARMY AND TIE US ALL TOGETHER
TO ME SAID THE SAW HORSE A GOOD LEG IS MORE DESIRABLE THAN EITHER
A NICKEL PLATED EMPEROR TIP AWOKE SOON AFTER DAWN BUT THE SCARECROW HAD ALREADY RISEN AND PLUCKED WITH HIS CLUMSY FINGERS A DOUBLE HANDFUL OF RIPE BERRIES FROM SOME BUSHES NEAR BY
PROFESSOR NOWITALL IS DOUBTLESS THE MOST FAMOUS SCHOLAR IN THE LAND OF OZ AND AFTER A FEW DAYS I BEGAN TO LISTEN TO THE LECTURES AND DISCOURSES HE GAVE HIS PUPILS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS MORE ATTENTIVE THAN THE HUMBLE UNNOTICED WOGGLE BUG
LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER CRITICALLY I BELIEVE THE BOY AND THE WOGGLE BUG ARE THE ONLY ONES IN OUR PARTY THAT ARE ABLE TO SWALLOW OBSERVING THE TRUTH OF THIS REMARK TIP SAID THEN I WILL UNDERTAKE TO MAKE THE FIRST WISH
AS COOLLY AS IF NO DANGER THREATENED HIS THRONE BUT THE PUMPKINHEAD HAVING CAUGHT SIGHT OF TIP AMBLED TOWARD THE BOY AS FAST AS HIS WOODEN LEGS WOULD GO GOOD AFTERNOON NOBLE PARENT HE CRIED DELIGHTEDLY
IT WAS THROUGH THIS GATEWAY HIS MAJESTY PROPOSED TO ESCAPE AND THE ROYAL ARMY NOW LED THE SAW HORSE ALONG THE PASSAGE
THE TIN WOODMAN LOOKED AROUND HIM IN A PUZZLED WAY FOR THE SAW HORSE HAD UNTIL NOW REMAINED QUIETLY STANDING IN A CORNER WHERE THE EMPEROR HAD NOT NOTICED HIM TIP IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE ODD LOOKING CREATURE TO THEM
AND I SUPPOSE HE IS NOW MORE PROUD THAN EVER OF HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HE IS INDEED SAID THE MAN WITH A POLITE BOW
OVERTURNING SEVERAL MEEK LOOKING MEN AND FINALLY BOWLING OVER THE NEW GUARDIAN OF THE GATE A FUSSY LITTLE FAT WOMAN APPOINTED BY GENERAL JINJUR NOR DID THE IMPETUOUS CHARGER STOP THEN
HE RATTLED AND CLANKED A LITTLE AS HE MOVED BUT IN THE MAIN HE SEEMED TO BE MOST CLEVERLY CONSTRUCTED AND HIS APPEARANCE WAS ONLY MARRED BY THE THICK COATING OF POLISHING PASTE THAT COVERED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT
THE FACE OF THE SCARECROW AND MANY PORTIONS OF HIS BODY BORE GREAT BLOTCHES OF PUTZ POMADE FOR THE TIN WOODMAN IN HIS EAGERNESS TO WELCOME HIS FRIEND HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE CONDITION OF HIS TOILET AND HAD RUBBED THE THICK COATING OF PASTE FROM HIS OWN BODY
HOW LARGE AN ARMY CAN YOU ASSEMBLE WE DO NOT NEED AN ARMY REPLIED THE WOODMAN WE FOUR WITH THE AID OF MY GLEAMING AXE ARE ENOUGH TO STRIKE TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE REBELS WE FIVE CORRECTED THE PUMPKINHEAD FIVE
IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE EVEN AS YOU NOW BEHOLD ME THE STUDENTS STOOD UP ON THEIR STOOLS AND CRANED THEIR HEADS FORWARD TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF ME AND TWO LITTLE GIRLS JUMPED UPON THE SILL OF AN OPEN WINDOW WHERE THEY COULD SEE MORE PLAINLY BEHOLD
AND THIS CROWN IS SO HEAVY THAT IT MAKES MY HEAD ACHE BUT I HOPE THE CONQUERORS HAVE NO INTENTION OF INJURING ME JUST BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE THE KING I HEARD THEM SAY REMARKED TIP WITH SOME HESITATION THAT THEY
YOU MUST REMEMBER IT IS THE REGULAR ORDAINED EXISTENCE OF WOGGLE BUGS
CAUGHT UP INTO KNOTS AND FASTENED WITH TINY SILVER AXES UPON A HANDSOME CENTER TABLE STOOD A LARGE SILVER OIL CAN RICHLY ENGRAVED WITH SCENES FROM THE PAST ADVENTURES OF THE TIN WOODMAN DOROTHY
I WILL GET OUT MY FAMOUS MAGNIFYING GLASS AND THROW THE INSECT UPON A SCREEN IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED CONDITION THAT YOU MAY ALL STUDY CAREFULLY ITS PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
FOR ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS PERCHED UPON THE WINDOW SILL GAVE A SCREAM AND FELL BACKWARD OUT THE WINDOW DRAWING HER COMPANION WITH HER AS SHE DISAPPEARED THE PROFESSOR UTTERED A CRY OF HORROR AND RUSHED AWAY THROUGH THE DOOR TO SEE IF THE POOR CHILDREN WERE INJURED BY THE FALL
THEY COULD USE YOU FOR SEED THE SOLDIER NOW RETURNED WITH A LONG LINE AND TIED ALL THREE FIRMLY TOGETHER ALSO LASHING THEM TO THE BODY OF THE SAW HORSE SO THERE SEEMED LITTLE DANGER OF THEIR TUMBLING OFF NOW THROW OPEN THE GATES COMMANDED THE SCARECROW
I'M SURE IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME REPLIED THE BOY THE SAW HORSE NOW AMBLED FORWARD AT A PACE SO FAST THAT ITS RIDERS HAD HARD WORK TO STICK UPON ITS BACK SO THERE WAS LITTLE FURTHER CONVERSATION
I WAS PROUD OF MY GREAT SIZE AND REALIZED THAT NOW I COULD SAFELY TRAVEL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHILE MY SUPERIOR CULTURE WOULD MAKE ME A FIT ASSOCIATE FOR THE MOST LEARNED PERSON I MIGHT CHANCE TO MEET SO WHILE THE PROFESSOR PICKED THE LITTLE GIRLS
THEN BRIGHT AND EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THEY SET OUT UPON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO THE EMERALD CITY
AS A MATTER OF FACT WE ARE NONE OF US ABOVE CRITICISM SO LET US BEAR WITH EACH OTHERS FAULTS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION SAID THE WOGGLE BUG APPROVINGLY YOU MUST HAVE AN EXCELLENT HEART MY METALLIC FRIEND I HAVE
ASKED THE WOGGLE BUG LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WITH UNCONCEALED INTEREST NOT MORE SO THAN YOURSELF ANSWERED THE SCARECROW EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS UNUSUAL UNTIL YOU GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT WHAT RARE PHILOSOPHY
AND AFTERWARD THE LITTLE PARTY RESUMED ITS JOURNEY
SAID THE TIN WOODMAN TAKING UP THE SCARECROW'S HEAD AND CARESSING IT TENDERLY
AND HIS MAJESTY HAS BEEN VERY KIND INDEED TO ME
SO THE SAW HORSE CONTINUED HIS WILD CAREER UNCHECKED AND WITH UNABATED SPEED PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO THE BANKS OF A WIDE RIVER
TAILORS HAVING LIKE CATS NINE LIVES AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE FELLOW WAS EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL FOR HAD HE LOST THAT NINTH LIFE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIM SO HE BEGGED PERMISSION TO FURNISH ME WITH THE STYLISH COSTUME I NOW WEAR
AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE FACED THEM WITH A MORE CHEERFUL EXPRESSION UPON HIS PAINTED FACE WHERE IS THE SAW HORSE YOU RODE HERE HE ASKED THE PUMPKINHEAD
HAS LATELY CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE NICKEL PLATED GOOD GRACIOUS THE SCARECROW EXCLAIMED AT HEARING THIS IF HIS WIT BEARS THE SAME POLISH HOW SPARKLING IT MUST BE BUT SHOW US IN
NOW MY BOY YOU MUST MOUNT FIRST AND PLEASE SIT AS CLOSE TO THE HORSE'S NECK AS POSSIBLE TIP CLIMBED QUICKLY TO HIS PLACE AND THE SOLDIER AND THE SCARECROW MANAGED TO HOIST THE PUMPKINHEAD TO A SEAT JUST BEHIND HIM
IT IS TOO LATE TO ESCAPE THEY WOULD SOON TEAR YOU TO PIECES THE SCARECROW SIGHED IN AN EMERGENCY HE ANNOUNCED IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO PAUSE AND REFLECT
I BEG YOU TO BE MORE CAREFUL IN YOUR SPEECH SAID THE PUMPKINHEAD SHARPLY REMEMBER IF YOU PLEASE THAT IT IS MY LEG YOU ARE ABUSING I CANNOT FORGET IT RETORTED THE SAW HORSE
THAT MAY BE BUT THE PILL GAVE ME A DREADFUL PAIN JUST THE SAME
IN ACT OF PRESENTING THE TIN WOODMAN WITH A HEART COVERED ALMOST ONE ENTIRE END OF THE ROOM WHILE THE VISITORS GAZED AT THESE THINGS IN SILENT ADMIRATION THEY SUDDENLY HEARD A LOUD VOICE IN THE NEXT ROOM EXCLAIM
SO WHEN THE JACKDAWS NEARLY KNOCKED HIM DOWN IN THEIR RUSH OF WINGS AND THEIR SHARP BEAKS AND CLAWS THREATENED TO DAMAGE HIS BRILLIANT PLATING THE WOODMAN PICKED UP HIS AXE AND MADE IT WHIRL SWIFTLY AROUND HIS HEAD
KNOWING NO BETTER I USED MY ARMS AS WELL AS MY LEGS FOR WALKING AND CRAWLED UNDER THE EDGES OF STONES OR HID AMONG THE ROOTS OF GRASSES WITH NO THOUGHT BEYOND FINDING A FEW INSECTS SMALLER THAN MYSELF TO FEED UPON
WHY NOT USE ONE OF HIS LEGS TO MAKE A LEG FOR THE HORSE THAT CARRIES HIM I JUDGE THAT BOTH ARE MADE OF WOOD NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL REAL CLEVERNESS SAID THE SCARECROW APPROVINGLY I WONDER MY BRAINS DID NOT THINK OF THAT LONG AGO
BUT THAT ANIMAL BEING STILL UPON HIS BACK KICKED OUT SO VICIOUSLY WITH HIS WOODEN LEGS
I DID IT TO SAVE MY FRIENDS RETURNED THE HEAD AND I AM GLAD THAT I PERISHED IN SO NOBLE AND UNSELFISH A MANNER BUT WHY ARE YOU ALL SO DESPONDENT INQUIRED THE WOGGLE BUG THE SCARECROW'S CLOTHING IS STILL SAFE
THE SAW HORSE ANSWERED FOR HIMSELF BUT I SEEM TO LEARN VERY QUICKLY AND OFTEN IT OCCURS TO ME THAT I KNOW MORE THAN ANY OF THOSE AROUND ME PERHAPS YOU DO SAID THE EMPEROR FOR EXPERIENCE DOES NOT ALWAYS MEAN WISDOM
AT THIS THEY ALL TURNED IN SURPRISE TO LOOK AT THE SCARECROW'S HEAD WHICH LAY AT THE BACK OF THE NEST I AM COMPLETELY RUINED DECLARED THE SCARECROW AS HE NOTED THEIR ASTONISHMENT
EXCLAIMED THE WOGGLE BUG ADMIRINGLY YES MY BRAINS ARE WORKING WELL TODAY ADMITTED THE SCARECROW AN ACCENT OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE THEN
AND TIP'S SUGGESTION WAS WITH THE SCARECROW'S CONSENT QUICKLY ACTED UPON THEY SELECTED ALL THE NEWEST AND CLEANEST BILLS AND ASSORTED THEM INTO VARIOUS PILES THE SCARECROW'S LEFT LEG AND BOOT WERE STUFFED WITH FIVE DOLLAR BILLS
ADDED THE SCARECROW YOUR MATHEMATICS SEEM TO ME VERY LIKE A BOTTLE OF MIXED PICKLES THE MORE YOU FISH FOR WHAT YOU WANT THE LESS CHANCE YOU HAVE OF GETTING IT I AM CERTAIN THAT IF THE THING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AT ALL IT IS IN A VERY SIMPLE MANNER
BUT ALTHOUGH MANY WERE BEATEN OFF IN THIS WAY THE BIRDS WERE SO NUMEROUS AND SO BRAVE THAT THEY CONTINUED THE ATTACK AS FURIOUSLY AS BEFORE SOME OF THEM PECKED AT THE EYES OF THE GUMP WHICH HUNG OVER THE NEST IN A HELPLESS CONDITION
I EXPECTED THIS BLOW SAID THE SOLDIER SULKILY BUT I CAN BEAR IT I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF BY CUTTING OFF MY LOVELY GREEN WHISKERS AND AFTER ALL
IT FITS VERY NICELY DOES IT NOT AND THE WOGGLE BUG STOOD UP AND TURNED HIMSELF AROUND SLOWLY
KEEP QUIET COMMANDED TIP STERNLY VERY WELL DEAR FATHER ANSWERED THE OBEDIENT JACK THE WOGGLE BUG LISTENED PATIENTLY EVEN RESPECTFULLY TO THESE REMARKS AND THEN RESUMED HIS STORY
AND IT WAS THE MORE NECESSARY BECAUSE I HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT SCRATCHED DURING MY ADVENTUROUS EXPERIENCES YOU WILL OBSERVE THIS ENGRAVED STAR UPON MY LEFT BREAST IT NOT ONLY INDICATES WHERE MY EXCELLENT HEART LIES BUT
WE OWE YOU MANY THANKS FOR THE GALLANT FIGHT YOU MADE I REALLY THINK WE HAVE ESCAPED VERY NICELY REMARKED THE TIN WOODMAN IN A TONE OF PRIDE NOT SO EXCLAIMED A HOLLOW VOICE
THE SCARECROW AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD WERE STILL PLAYING AT QUOITS IN THE COURTYARD WHEN THE GAME WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE ABRUPT ENTRANCE OF THE ROYAL ARMY OF OZ WHO CAME FLYING IN WITHOUT HIS HAT OR GUN
BUT PARDON ME IF I SEEM INQUISITIVE
CRIED TO THE TIN WOODMAN TO SAVE HIM AND THAT GOOD FRIEND RESPONDED WITH RENEWED ENERGY HIS AXE FAIRLY FLASHED AMONG THE JACKDAWS AND FORTUNATELY THE GUMP BEGAN WILDLY WAVING THE TWO WINGS REMAINING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF ITS BODY
AND WITHOUT A PAUSE THE WOODEN STEED GAVE ONE FINAL LEAP AND LAUNCHED THEM ALL IN MID AIR A SECOND LATER THEY WERE ROLLING SPLASHING AND BOBBING ABOUT IN THE WATER
TIP DURING THIS CONVERSATION WAS LOOKING AT THE WOODMAN WITH UNDISGUISED AMAZEMENT AND NOTICED THAT THE CELEBRATED EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES WAS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF PIECES OF TIN
THE FLUTTER OF THESE GREAT WINGS FILLED THE JACKDAWS WITH TERROR AND WHEN THE GUMP
THIS THE SCARECROW TRIED TO DO BUT HIS PADDED GLOVES WERE TOO CLUMSY TO CLUTCH SO SMALL AN OBJECT AND HE HELD THE BOX TOWARD THE BOY WHILE TIP SELECTED ONE OF THE PILLS AND SWALLOWED IT COUNT CRIED THE SCARECROW
AND I ACQUIRED IN THIS WAY A FUND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL MYSELF CONFESS IS SIMPLY MARVELOUS THAT IS WHY I PLACE T E THOROUGHLY EDUCATED UPON MY CARDS
NOT EXACTLY REPLIED THE SCARECROW FOR IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO ME
THEN AT ONCE THE PAIN STOPPED AND THE BOY ROSE TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND FOUND THE SCARECROW LOOKING WITH AMAZEMENT AT THE END OF THE PEPPER BOX WHAT'S HAPPENED ASKED THE BOY A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HIS RECENT EXHIBITION
FOR NO MAN COULD FACE THE TERRIBLE WEAPONS OF THE INVADERS WELL SAID THE SCARECROW AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT
IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE I COULD THINK OF YOUR MAJESTY ADDED THE SOLDIER FEARING HE HAD MADE A BLUNDER IT PLEASES ME VERY MUCH SAID THE SCARECROW HAS THE ANIMAL BEEN FED
THE SCHOLARS FOLLOWED AFTER HIM IN A WILD MOB AND I WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE SCHOOL ROOM STILL IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE AND FREE TO DO AS I PLEASED IT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO ME
CRIED THE PROFESSOR IN A LOUD VOICE THIS HIGHLY MAGNIFIED WOGGLE BUG
THAT INSECTS WORE CLOTHES NOR DO THEY IN THEIR NATURAL STATE RETURNED THE STRANGER BUT IN THE COURSE OF MY WANDERINGS I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SAVE THE NINTH LIFE OF A TAILOR
FOR SHE NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL WHY NOT START COUNTING AT A HALF OF ONE ASKED THE SAW HORSE ABRUPTLY THEN ANYONE CAN COUNT UP TO SEVENTEEN BY TWOS VERY EASILY THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN SURPRISE FOR THE SAW HORSE WAS CONSIDERED
NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR WAS THE REPLY ALTHOUGH IT IS MY INTENTION SOON TO VISIT THE EMERALD CITY
THEN IF ONE FALLS OFF WE WILL ALL FALL OFF AND WHILE THE SOLDIER WAS GONE FOR THE CLOTHESLINE HIS MAJESTY CONTINUED
REPEATED THE TIN WOODMAN YES
SUGGESTED TIP I CAN'T SAID THE SCARECROW WHY NOT YOU'VE A MOUTH HAVEN'T YOU ASKED THE BOY YES BUT MY MOUTH IS PAINTED ON AND THERE'S NO SWALLOW CONNECTED WITH IT ANSWERED THE SCARECROW IN FACT HE CONTINUED
EXCELLENT CRIED THE SCARECROW BRING THE HORSE HERE AT ONCE THE SOLDIER HASTENED AWAY AND PRESENTLY THEY HEARD THE CLATTERING OF THE HORSE'S WOODEN LEGS UPON THE PAVEMENT AS HE WAS LED INTO THE COURTYARD HIS MAJESTY REGARDED THE STEED CRITICALLY
IT IS NO MORE DANGEROUS TO FACE THOSE RECKLESS GIRLS THAN TO RIDE THIS FIERY UNTAMED WOODEN HORSE PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT OBSERVED HIS MAJESTY BUT FOR MY PART NOT BEING A SOLDIER I AM FOND OF DANGER
LET US BEND OUR STEPS TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY
HE DOESN'T SEEM ESPECIALLY GRACEFUL HE REMARKED MUSINGLY BUT I SUPPOSE HE CAN RUN HE CAN INDEED SAID TIP GAZING UPON THE SAW HORSE ADMIRINGLY
ENTREATED THE TIN WOODMAN TEARS OF SYMPATHY RUNNING DOWN HIS NICKEL CHEEKS I I DON'T KNOW
BUT TIME IS PRECIOUS JUST NOW SO LET US QUICKLY MAKE PREPARATIONS TO START UPON OUR JOURNEY THE EMPEROR CALLED HIS LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR AND INSTRUCTED HIM HOW TO RUN THE KINGDOM DURING HIS ABSENCE MEANWHILE THE SCARECROW WAS TAKEN APART
THE MOST STUPID OF THE ENTIRE PARTY YOU MAKE ME QUITE ASHAMED OF MYSELF SAID THE SCARECROW BOWING LOW TO THE SAW HORSE NEVERTHELESS THE CREATURE IS RIGHT DECLARED THE WOGGLE BUG
BUT THE GUMP'S EYES WERE OF GLASS AND COULD NOT BE INJURED
SAID HE I HAVE CAPTURED A WOGGLE BUG A VERY RARE AND INTERESTING SPECIMEN DO ANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT A WOGGLE BUG IS NO YELLED THE SCHOLARS IN CHORUS THEN SAID THE PROFESSOR
ARE LIABLE TO LIVE FOR MANY YEARS MY LIFE IS NECESSARILY SHORT SO I MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FEW DAYS THAT REMAIN TO ME THERE THERE DON'T WORRY ANSWERED THE SCARECROW SOOTHINGLY
BUT I WON'T TAKE ANOTHER PILL I PROMISE YOU AND WITH THIS REMARK HE RETIRED SULKILY TO THE BACK OF THE NEST WELL SAID THE WOGGLE BUG IT REMAINS FOR ME TO SAVE US IN MY MOST HIGHLY MAGNIFIED AND THOROUGHLY EDUCATED MANNER FOR I SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE AND WILLING TO MAKE A WISH
TO ACCEPT YOUR KIND INVITATION FOR NOWHERE IN THE LAND OF OZ COULD I HOPE TO MEET WITH SO CONGENIAL A COMPANY THAT IS TRUE ACKNOWLEDGED THE PUMPKINHEAD WE ARE QUITE AS CONGENIAL AS FLIES AND HONEY
OTHERS RAN SCREAMING OUT OF THE WAY AND ONLY ONE OR TWO JABBED THEIR KNITTING NEEDLES FRANTICALLY AT THE ESCAPING PRISONERS
WE LISTENED WE FORGOT OUR SUFFERINGS WE HOPED ONCE MORE WE HAD STAKED OUR SALVATION ON THIS ONE LAST GAMBLE DESPITE THE BUZZING IN MY HEAD I SOON COULD HEAR VIBRATIONS UNDER THE NAUTILUS'S HULL WE TILTED
HE SAID IN A CALM VOICE THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DYING UNDER THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE'RE PLACED THIS INEXPLICABLE INDIVIDUAL ACTED LIKE A MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR WORKING OUT A PROBLEM FOR HIS PUPILS THE FIRST WAY HE WENT ON
THEN HIS MEN SIMULTANEOUSLY STAKED IT OFF AT SEVERAL POINTS AROUND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE SOON THEIR PICKS WERE VIGOROUSLY ATTACKING THIS COMPACT MATTER AND HUGE CHUNKS WERE LOOSENED FROM ITS MASS
BUT IF WE RETURNED TO THE PACIFIC FAR FROM EVERY POPULATED SHORE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO NED LAND'S PLANS WE WOULD SOON SETTLE THIS IMPORTANT POINT THE NAUTILUS TRAVELED SWIFTLY
WITHOUT THIS PRECAUTION WE WOULDN'T HAVE AWAKENED THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE NEXT DAY MARCH TWENTY SIXTH I RETURNED TO MY MINER'S TRADE WORKING TO REMOVE THE FIFTH METER THE ICE BANK'S SIDE WALLS AND UNDERBELLY HAD VISIBLY THICKENED
IT WAS NOW THE TWENTY SIXTH WE HAD LIVED OFF THE SHIP'S STORES FOR FIVE DAYS AND ALL REMAINING BREATHABLE AIR HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN EVEN TODAY AS I WRITE THESE LINES MY SENSATIONS ARE SO INTENSE
MY FRIENDS I SAID WE'RE IN A SERIOUS PREDICAMENT BUT I'M COUNTING ON YOUR COURAGE AND ENERGY SIR THE CANADIAN REPLIED THIS IS NO TIME TO BORE YOU WITH MY COMPLAINTS
IN THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP FINE SAMPLES OF ALGAE IN PARTICULAR CERTAIN FUCUS PLANTS WHOSE ROOTS WERE LADEN WITH THE WORLD'S BEST MUSSELS
YES I REPLIED BECAUSE WE'RE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN AND HERE THE SUN IS DUE NORTH SURE NED LAND WENT ON BUT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER WE'LL MAKE FOR THE ATLANTIC OR THE PACIFIC
WE COULD SUCK THE ATOMS FROM THE AIR BY THE LUNGFUL AND IT WAS THE BREEZE THE BREEZE ITSELF THAT POURED INTO US THIS LUXURIOUS INTOXICATION AHHH CONSEIL WAS PUTTING IN
THE BOAT SANK AND WAS FITTED INTO ITS SOCKET JUST THEN THE WHOLE CREW RETURNED ON BOARD AND THE DOUBLE OUTSIDE DOOR WAS CLOSED BY THIS POINT THE NAUTILUS WAS RESTING ON A BED OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK
I'M GOING TO GROUND THE NAUTILUS ON THE LOWER SHELF THEN MY MEN WILL PUT ON THEIR DIVING SUITS AND ATTACK THE THINNEST OF THESE ICE WALLS CAN THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE BE LEFT OPEN WITHOUT ILL EFFECT WE'RE NO LONGER IN MOTION
THE NAUTILUS'S CHIEF OFFICER SUPERVISED US THE WATER STRUCK ME AS UNUSUALLY COLD BUT I WARMED UP PROMPTLY WHILE WIELDING MY PICK MY MOVEMENTS WERE QUITE FREE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE EXECUTED UNDER A PRESSURE OF THIRTY ATMOSPHERES
THESE CHUNKS WEIGHED LESS THAN THE WATER AND BY AN UNUSUAL EFFECT OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY EACH CHUNK TOOK WING AS IT WERE TO THE ROOF OF THE TUNNEL
SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CUBIC METERS TO DIG A HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE SHIP COULD DESCEND BELOW THIS TRACT OF ICE WORK BEGAN IMMEDIATELY AND WAS CARRIED ON WITH TIRELESS TENACITY INSTEAD OF DIGGING ALL AROUND THE NAUTILUS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENTAILED EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTIES
IT'S WORTH TRYING I SAID RESOLUTELY SO LET'S TRY IT PROFESSOR
BEFORE DIGGING INTO THE ICE THE CAPTAIN HAD TO OBTAIN BORINGS TO INSURE WORKING IN THE BEST DIRECTION LONG BORES WERE DRIVEN INTO THE SIDE WALLS BUT AFTER FIFTEEN METERS THE INSTRUMENTS WERE STILL IMPEDED BY THE THICKNESS OF THOSE WALLS
THEREFORE LET'S CONCENTRATE ON OUR CHANCES OF BEING CRUSHED OR ASPHYXIATED AS FOR ASPHYXIATION CAPTAIN I REPLIED THAT ISN'T A CAUSE FOR ALARM BECAUSE THE AIR TANKS ARE FULL TRUE
IN A FEW MINUTES THE WATER REACHED ONE HUNDRED DEGREES CENTIGRADE IT WAS SENT TO THE PUMPS WHILE NEW WATER REPLACED IT IN THE PROCESS THE HEAT GENERATED BY OUR BATTERIES WAS SO INTENSE THAT AFTER SIMPLY GOING THROUGH THE MECHANISM WATER DRAWN COLD FROM THE SEA ARRIVED
THERE WE WERE SEPARATED FROM THE SEA BY A TEN METER BARRIER THAT'S HOW THICK THE ICEBERG WAS FROM THIS POINT ON IT WAS AN ISSUE OF CUTTING OUT A PIECE EQUAL IN SURFACE AREA TO THE NAUTILUS'S WATERLINE THIS MEANT DETACHING ABOUT
CAPTAIN NEMO LED ME TO THE GALLEY WHERE A HUGE DISTILLING MECHANISM WAS AT WORK SUPPLYING DRINKING WATER VIA EVAPORATION THE MECHANISM WAS LOADED WITH WATER AND THE FULL ELECTRIC HEAT OF OUR BATTERIES WAS THROWN INTO COILS AWASH IN LIQUID
OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE AREA ONLY TWO METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED ONLY TWO METERS SEPARATED US FROM THE OPEN SEA BUT THE SHIP'S AIR TANKS WERE NEARLY EMPTY THE LITTLE AIR THAT REMAINED HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN NOT AN
I LIKEWISE MARVELED AT THE NUMEROUS MEDUSAS INCLUDING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEIR BREED THE COMPASS JELLYFISH UNIQUE TO THE FALKLAND SEAS
WITH VEGETABLES FROM THE SEA LIKE THE ENGLISH WITH THEIR IRISH STEWS THE NAUTILUS PASSED OVER THESE LUSH LUXURIANT DEPTHS WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED
BUT THIS HARDLY MATTERED SO LONG AS THE LOWER SURFACE KEPT GROWING THINNER AFTER TWO HOURS OF ENERGETIC WORK NED LAND REENTERED EXHAUSTED HE AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE REPLACED BY NEW WORKMEN INCLUDING CONSEIL AND ME
KEEPING TO ITS NORTHERLY HEADING IT FOLLOWED THE LONG WINDINGS OF SOUTH AMERICA BY THEN WE HAD FARED SIXTEEN THOUSAND LEAGUES SINCE COMING ON BOARD IN THE SEAS OF JAPAN
TO LEAVE MORE AIR FOR MASTER IT BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES TO HEAR HIM SAY THESE WORDS SINCE CONDITIONS INSIDE WERE UNIVERSALLY UNBEARABLE
DIDN'T PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
AND SHAKE THEM CONTINUALLY BUT THIS SUBSTANCE WAS MISSING ON BOARD AND NOTHING ELSE COULD REPLACE IT
WHEN HIS TIME WAS UP HE YIELDED HIS EQUIPMENT TO ANOTHER AND REENTERED THE FOUL AIR ON BOARD ALWAYS CALM UNFLINCHING AND UNCOMPLAINING THAT DAY THE USUAL WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH EVEN GREATER ENERGY
THE LAND OF FIRE A NAME GIVEN IT BY EARLY NAVIGATORS AFTER THEY SAW NUMEROUS CURLS OF SMOKE RISING FROM THE NATIVES HUTS THIS LAND OF FIRE FORMS A HUGE CLUSTER OF ISLANDS OVER THIRTY LEAGUES LONG AND EIGHTY LEAGUES WIDE
MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED METERS HIGH
HEADACHES AND STAGGERING FITS OF DIZZINESS MADE ME REEL LIKE A DRUNK MY COMPANIONS WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME SYMPTOMS SOME CREWMEN WERE AT THEIR LAST GASP
NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS MY GALLANT CONSEIL FELT THE SAME SYMPTOMS SUFFERED THE SAME SUFFERINGS YET NEVER LEFT MY SIDE HE HELD MY HAND HE KEPT ENCOURAGING ME AND I EVEN HEARD HIM MUTTER
THAT WAS ONE DEGREE GAINED
YAWNS DISLOCATED MY JAWS MY LUNGS WERE GASPING IN THEIR QUEST FOR THAT ENKINDLING ELASTIC FLUID REQUIRED FOR BREATHING NOW GROWING SCARCER AND SCARCER MY MIND WAS IN A DAZE I LAY OUTSTRETCHED STRENGTH GONE
I WAS FINALLY ASSURED THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF IT SOLIDIFYING BY THE NEXT DAY MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH SIX METERS OF ICE HAD BEEN TORN FROM THE SOCKET ONLY FOUR METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED THAT STILL MEANT FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF WORK
OR WE'LL BE SEALED UP IN THIS SOLIDIFIED WATER AS IF IT WERE CEMENT YES I SAID BUT WHAT CAN WE DO OH HE EXCLAIMED
THAT AN INVOLUNTARY TERROR SWEEPS OVER ME AND MY LUNGS STILL SEEM SHORT OF AIR MEANWHILE
CAPTAIN NEMO HAD NO LIKING FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BRAZIL'S POPULOUS SHORES BECAUSE HE SHOT BY WITH DIZZYING SPEED
CONSEIL KEPT STILL I STARED AT THE CAPTAIN HIS FACE HAD RESUMED ITS USUAL EMOTIONLESSNESS HE CROSSED HIS ARMS HE PONDERED THE NAUTILUS DID NOT STIR THE CAPTAIN THEN BROKE INTO SPEECH GENTLEMEN
BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES COULDN'T WE ALL DIE OF ASPHYXIATION WERE THIS SHIP AND EVERYONE ON BOARD DOOMED TO PERISH IN THIS TOMB OF ICE IT WAS A DREADFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS BUT WE FACED IT HEAD ON
BOILING WATER I EXCLAIMED YES SIR WE'RE SHUT UP IN A RELATIVELY CONFINED AREA IF THE NAUTILUS'S PUMPS CONTINUALLY INJECTED STREAMS OF BOILING WATER INTO THIS SPACE WOULDN'T THAT RAISE ITS TEMPERATURE AND DELAY ITS FREEZING
NEAR EVENING ONE MORE METER HAD BEEN DUG FROM THE TRENCH WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I WAS WELLNIGH ASPHYXIATED BY THE CARBON DIOXIDE SATURATING THE AIR OH IF ONLY WE HAD THE CHEMICAL METHODS THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO DRIVE OUT THIS NOXIOUS GAS
A PYRAMID SHAPED BLOCK OF SHALE WITH A VERY SHARP SUMMIT WHICH DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT'S CLEAR OR VEILED IN VAPOR PREDICTS FAIR WEATHER OR FOUL AS NED LAND TOLD ME A FIRST CLASS BAROMETER MY FRIEND
THE CAPTAIN UNDERSTOOD AND GAVE ME A SIGNAL TO FOLLOW HIM WE RETURNED ON BOARD MY DIVING SUIT REMOVED I WENT WITH HIM TO THE LOUNGE PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE TOLD ME THIS CALLS FOR HEROIC MEASURES
AND GRATITUDE TO MY TWO COMPANIONS NED AND CONSEIL HAD KEPT ME ALIVE DURING THE FINAL HOURS OF OUR LONG DEATH THROES BUT NO EXPRESSION OF THANKS COULD REPAY THEM FULLY FOR SUCH DEVOTION
SOME OF THESE JELLYFISH WERE SHAPED LIKE VERY SMOOTH SEMISPHERIC PARASOLS WITH RUSSET STRIPES AND FRINGES OF TWELVE NEAT FESTOONS OTHERS LOOKED LIKE
THE WORK KEPT ME GOING BESIDES WORKING MEANT LEAVING THE NAUTILUS WHICH MEANT BREATHING THE CLEAN OXYGEN DRAWN FROM THE AIR TANKS AND SUPPLIED BY OUR EQUIPMENT WHICH MEANT LEAVING THE THIN FOUL AIR BEHIND
OUR FULL ELECTRIC POWER WAS THEN PUT ON THE PUMPS WHICH INSTANTLY BEGAN TO EXPEL WATER FROM THE BALLAST TANKS AFTER A FEW MINUTES WE HAD CHECKED OUR FALL THE PRESSURE GAUGE SOON INDICATED AN ASCENDING MOVEMENT
WORKING HIMSELF CAPTAIN NEMO PASSED NEAR ME JUST THEN I TOUCHED HIM WITH MY HAND AND POINTED TO THE WALLS OF OUR PRISON THE STARBOARD WALL HAD MOVED FORWARD TO A POINT LESS THAN FOUR METERS FROM THE NAUTILUS'S HULL
OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD COME TOGETHER BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD BREAK FREE FOR AN INSTANT I WAS GRIPPED BY DESPAIR MY PICK NEARLY SLIPPED FROM MY HANDS WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS DIGGING IF I WAS TO DIE SMOTHERED AND CRUSHED BY THIS WATER TURNING TO STONE
HISSING SOUNDS SOON TOLD ME THAT WATER WAS BEING ADMITTED INTO THE BALLAST TANKS THE NAUTILUS SLOWLY SETTLED AND RESTED ON THE ICY BOTTOM AT A DEPTH OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY METERS THE DEPTH AT WHICH THE LOWER SHELF OF ICE LAY SUBMERGED
NEXT TO ME MY TWO COMPANIONS WERE GETTING TIPSY ON THE FRESH OXYGEN PARTICLES POOR SOULS WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM LONG STARVATION MUSTN'T POUNCE HEEDLESSLY ON THE FIRST FOOD GIVEN THEM WE ON THE OTHER HAND DIDN'T HAVE TO PRACTICE SUCH MODERATION
BUT THERE AREN'T TEN FEET OF WATER AHEAD OR ASTERN OF THE NAUTILUS ALL AROUND US THIS FREEZE IS GAINING FAST HOW LONG I ASKED WILL THE OXYGEN IN THE AIR TANKS ENABLE US TO BREATHE ON BOARD THE CAPTAIN LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
I SQUEEZED IT IN AN INVOLUNTARY CONVULSION ALL AT ONCE CARRIED AWAY BY ITS FRIGHTFUL EXCESS LOAD THE NAUTILUS SANK INTO THE WATERS LIKE A CANNONBALL IN OTHER WORDS DROPPING AS IF IN A VACUUM
WHEN I NOTED THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SIDE WALLS WERE CLOSING IN ON EACH OTHER THE LIQUID STRATA FARTHEST FROM THE TRENCH NOT WARMED BY THE MOVEMENTS OF WORKMEN AND TOOLS WERE SHOWING A TENDENCY TO SOLIDIFY IN THE FACE OF THIS IMMINENT NEW DANGER
AS FOR FISH I SPECIFICALLY OBSERVED SOME BONY FISH BELONGING TO THE GOBY GENUS ESPECIALLY SOME GUDGEON TWO DECIMETERS LONG SPRINKLED WITH WHITISH AND YELLOW SPOTS
WELL THEN CAPTAIN LET'S FREE OURSELVES WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS WE'LL TRY TO AT LEAST BY CUTTING THROUGH ONE OF THESE WALLS SURROUNDING US WHICH ONE I ASKED BORINGS WILL TELL US THAT
A FEW WHIFFS OF AIR HAD ENTERED MY LUNGS HAD WE RISEN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES HAD WE CLEARED THE ICE BANK NO NED AND CONSEIL MY TWO GALLANT FRIENDS WERE SACRIFICING THEMSELVES TO SAVE ME
MY MUSCLES HAD NO POWER TO CONTRACT I'M UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE HOURS THAT PASSED IN THIS WAY BUT I WAS AWARE THAT MY DEATH THROES HAD BEGUN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE SUDDENLY I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
THERE WAS NO LACK OF OXYGEN ALL THIS WATER CONTAINED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT
THAT'S GOOD NEWS THE CANADIAN REPLIED BUT WHERE'S THE NAUTILUS GOING I'M UNABLE TO SAY NED AFTER THE SOUTH POLE
YES SIR A NATURAL BAROMETER THAT DIDN'T LET ME DOWN WHEN I NAVIGATED THE NARROWS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN JUST THEN ITS PEAK APPEARED BEFORE US STANDING OUT DISTINCTLY AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE SKIES THIS FORECAST FAIR WEATHER
CHAPTER SIXTEEN SHORTAGE OF AIR CONSEQUENTLY ABOVE BELOW AND AROUND THE NAUTILUS THERE WERE IMPENETRABLE FROZEN WALLS WE WERE THE ICE BANK'S PRISONERS THE CANADIAN BANGED A TABLE WITH HIS FEARSOME FIST
AFTER NED WAS DRESSED I REENTERED THE LOUNGE WHOSE WINDOWS HAD BEEN UNCOVERED STATIONED NEXT TO CONSEIL I EXAMINED THE STRATA SURROUNDING AND SUPPORTING THE NAUTILUS SOME MOMENTS LATER WE SAW A DOZEN CREWMEN SET FOOT ON THE SHELF OF ICE
INSTEAD OF BREATHING IT THEMSELVES THEY HAD SAVED IT FOR ME AND WHILE THEY WERE SUFFOCATING THEY POURED LIFE INTO ME DROP BY DROP I TRIED TO PUSH THE DEVICE AWAY THEY HELD MY HANDS AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS I COULD BREATHE LUXURIOUSLY
WE'LL NEVER REGRET HAVING KNOWN HIM ESPECIALLY ONCE WE'VE LEFT HIM NED LAND SHOT BACK THE NEXT DAY
BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY FIVE METERS AND WENT ALONG THE SOUTH AMERICAN COAST
IT SERVED AS BOTH NEST AND NOURISHMENT FOR MYRIADS OF CRUSTACEANS AND MOLLUSKS FOR CRABS AND CUTTLEFISH HERE SEALS AND OTTERS COULD INDULGE IN A SUMPTUOUS MEAL MIXING MEAT FROM FISH
SHADOWS ILLUSIONS MELTING AND EVAPORATING OUTSIDE THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT WHEN THE LAST TIPS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS HAD DISAPPEARED BELOW THE HORIZON
HAD HE PERISHED HAD HIS COMPANIONS DIED WITH HIM
HE CAN USE ME ANY WAY HE WANTS HE WON'T TURN DOWN YOUR ASSISTANCE COME ALONG NED I LED THE CANADIAN TO THE ROOM WHERE THE NAUTILUS'S MEN WERE PUTTING ON THEIR DIVING SUITS I INFORMED THE CAPTAIN OF NED'S PROPOSITION
SOON WE HAD CLEARED THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE PLUS THE PROMONTORY OF CAPE HORN
I KNOW IT SIR SO WE CAN'T RELY ON NATURE TO RESCUE US ONLY OUR OWN EFFORTS WE MUST COUNTERACT THIS SOLIDIFICATION WE MUST HOLD IT IN CHECK NOT ONLY ARE THE SIDE WALLS CLOSING IN
AND WHAT POWERFUL INHALATIONS THE CANADIAN DREW LIKE A FURNACE GOING FULL BLAST OUR STRENGTH RETURNED PROMPTLY AND WHEN I LOOKED AROUND I SAW THAT WE WERE ALONE ON THE PLATFORM NO CREWMEN
THE INJECTIONS COULDN'T GET IT TO GO A SINGLE DEGREE HIGHER
A TORTURE UNDREAMED OF BY EVEN THE WILDEST SAVAGES I FELT LIKE I WAS LYING IN THE JAWS OF A FEARSOME MONSTER JAWS IRRESISTIBLY CLOSING SUPERVISING OUR WORK
AND YOU MY GALLANT CONSEIL YOU SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL NOT TOO MUCH TO BE CANDID WITH MASTER I WAS LACKING A FEW THROATFULS OF AIR BUT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BY
FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON HOW I GOT ONTO THE PLATFORM I'M UNABLE TO SAY PERHAPS THE CANADIAN TRANSFERRED ME THERE BUT I COULD BREATHE I COULD INHALE THE LIFE GIVING SEA AIR
THE ICE CRACKED WITH AN ODD RIPPING SOUND LIKE PAPER TEARING AND THE NAUTILUS BEGAN SETTLING DOWNWARD WE'RE GOING THROUGH CONSEIL MUTTERED IN MY EAR I COULDN'T ANSWER HIM I CLUTCHED HIS HAND
WHEN THE NAUTILUS ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES BEFORE NOON WE RAISED LAND TO THE WEST
NOW THEN THAT EVENING IT BECAME OBVIOUS MUCH TO MY SATISFACTION THAT WE WERE RETURNING NORTH BY THE ATLANTIC ROUTE I SHARED THE RESULTS OF MY OBSERVATIONS WITH THE CANADIAN AND CONSEIL
WHICH WAS PROMPTLY ACCEPTED THE CANADIAN GOT INTO HIS UNDERWATER COSTUME AND WAS READY AS SOON AS HIS FELLOW WORKERS
BULB BEARING SEAWEED OF WHICH THE OPEN SEA AT THE POLE HAD REVEALED A FEW SPECIMENS WITH THEIR SMOOTH VISCOUS FILAMENTS THEY MEASURED AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED METERS LONG GENUINE CABLES MORE THAN AN INCH THICK AND VERY TOUGH
WE'RE BOUND TO EACH OTHER FOREVER AND I'M DEEPLY INDEBTED TO YOU WHICH I'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CANADIAN SHOT BACK
IS DEATH BY CRUSHING THE SECOND IS DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION I DON'T MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH BY STARVATION BECAUSE THE NAUTILUS'S PROVISIONS WILL CERTAINLY LAST LONGER THAN WE WILL
NEAR ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WE CUT THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN ON THE THIRTY SEVENTH MERIDIAN PASSING WELL OUT FROM CAPE FRIO MUCH TO NED LAND'S DISPLEASURE
UPSIDE DOWN BASKETS FROM WHICH WIDE LEAVES AND LONG RED TWIGS WERE GRACEFULLY TRAILING THEY SWAM WITH QUIVERINGS OF THEIR FOUR LEAFLIKE ARMS LETTING THE OPULENT TRESSES OF THEIR TENTACLES DANGLE IN THE DRIFT
EACH ONE OF US DETERMINED TO DO HIS DUTY TO THE END DURING THE NIGHT IN LINE WITH MY FORECASTS A NEW ONE METER SLICE WAS REMOVED FROM THIS IMMENSE SOCKET BUT IN THE MORNING WEARING MY DIVING SUIT
BY THEN ALL OUR PAST SUFFERINGS WERE FORGOTTEN THE MEMORY OF THAT IMPRISONMENT UNDER THE ICE FADED FROM OUR MINDS WE HAD THOUGHTS ONLY OF THE FUTURE
AFTER I MONITORED THE OPERATION'S PROGRESS DOUBLE CHECKING IT WITH MANY INSPECTIONS I TOLD THE CAPTAIN IT'S WORKING I THINK SO HE ANSWERED ME WE'VE ESCAPED BEING CRUSHED NOW WE HAVE ONLY ASPHYXIATION TO FEAR
AND HE DECIDED TO CRUSH THIS LAYER THE MAN HAD KEPT HIS ENERGY AND COMPOSURE HE HAD SUBDUED PHYSICAL PAIN WITH MORAL STRENGTH HE COULD STILL THINK PLAN AND ACT AT HIS ORDERS THE CRAFT WAS EASED OFF
PICKS RANG OUT ON THAT BED OF ICE ARMS GREW WEARY HANDS WERE RUBBED RAW BUT WHO CARED ABOUT EXHAUSTION WHAT DIFFERENCE WERE WOUNDS LIFE SUSTAINING AIR REACHED OUR LUNGS WE COULD BREATHE WE COULD BREATHE
ATOM FOR THE NAUTILUS WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I FELT HALF SUFFOCATED WHAT A NIGHT I'M UNABLE TO DEPICT IT SUCH SUFFERINGS ARE INDESCRIBABLE THE NEXT DAY I WAS SHORT WINDED
IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS RAISED FROM ITS ICY BED BY A CHANGE IN ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY WHEN IT WAS AFLOAT THE CREW TOWED IT LEADING IT RIGHT ABOVE THE IMMENSE TRENCH OUTLINED TO MATCH THE SHIP'S WATERLINE NEXT THE BALLAST TANKS FILLED WITH WATER
THERE WAS NO POINT IN DAMPENING THE ENERGY THEY WERE PUTTING INTO OUR ARDUOUS RESCUE WORK BUT WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD
AND YET NOBODY PROLONGED HIS UNDERWATER WORK BEYOND THE TIME ALLOTTED HIM HIS SHIFT OVER EACH MAN SURRENDERED TO A GASPING COMPANION THE AIR TANK THAT WOULD REVIVE HIM
IS TO WORK FASTER THAN THE WATER SOLIDIFIES WE'VE GOT TO GET THERE FIRST THAT'S ALL GET THERE FIRST BY THEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO THIS TYPE OF TALK FOR SEVERAL HOURS THAT DAY I WIELDED MY PICK DOGGEDLY
BUT THEY'LL SUPPLY AIR FOR ONLY TWO DAYS NOW THEN WE'VE BEEN BURIED BENEATH THE WATERS FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS AND THE NAUTILUS'S HEAVY ATMOSPHERE ALREADY NEEDS RENEWING IN ANOTHER FORTY EIGHT HOURS OUR RESERVE AIR WILL BE USED UP
I KNOW HE TOLD ME IN THAT CALM TONE THE MOST DREADFUL OUTLOOK COULDN'T CHANGE IT'S ONE MORE DANGER BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY WAY OF WARDING IT OFF OUR SOLE CHANCE FOR SALVATION
THOSE STRANGE SEAMEN ON THE NAUTILUS WERE CONTENT WITH THE OXYGEN CIRCULATING INSIDE NOT ONE OF THEM HAD COME UP TO ENJOY THE OPEN AIR THE FIRST WORDS I PRONOUNCED WERE WORDS OF APPRECIATION
AFTER TWELVE HOURS HAD GONE BY WE HAD REMOVED FROM THE OUTLINED SURFACE AREA A SLICE OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK HENCE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED CUBIC METERS ASSUMING THE SAME WORK WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED EVERY TWELVE HOURS
BROUGHT TO FULL SPEED THE PROPELLER MADE THE SHEET IRON HULL TREMBLE DOWN TO ITS RIVETS AND WE SPED NORTHWARD BUT HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO NAVIGATE UNDER THE ICE BANK TO THE OPEN SEA ANOTHER DAY I WOULD BE DEAD FIRST
BOILING HOT AT THE BODY OF THE PUMP THE STEAMING WATER WAS INJECTED INTO THE ICY WATER OUTSIDE AND AFTER THREE HOURS HAD PASSED
IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY IN A MANNER OF CONFOUNDED BY THIS LAPSE INTO BANALITY CONSEIL LEFT HIS SENTENCE HANGING MY FRIENDS I REPLIED VERY MOVED
THIS LIFE GIVING ELASTIC FLUID COULD HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO US I HAD THOUGHT IT ALL OUT BUT TO NO AVAIL BECAUSE THE CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCED BY OUR BREATHING PERMEATED EVERY PART OF THE SHIP TO ABSORB IT WE WOULD NEED TO FILL CONTAINERS WITH POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE
GOOD LORD PROFESSOR NED LAND ANSWERED ME DON'T MENTION IT WHAT DID WE DO THAT'S SO PRAISEWORTHY NOT A THING IT WAS A QUESTION OF SIMPLE ARITHMETIC YOUR LIFE IS WORTH MORE THAN OURS SO WE HAD TO SAVE IT
WHAT FINE OXYGEN LET MASTER HAVE NO FEARS ABOUT BREATHING THERE'S ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE AS FOR NED LAND HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD BUT HIS WIDE OPEN JAWS WOULD HAVE SCARED OFF A SHARK
COULD COME TO OUR RESCUE DON'T YOU SEE THAT BY SOLIDIFYING IT COULD BURST THESE TRACTS OF ICE IMPRISONING US JUST AS ITS FREEZING CAN BURST THE HARDEST STONES AREN'T YOU AWARE THAT THIS FORCE COULD BE THE INSTRUMENT OF OUR SALVATION RATHER THAN OUR DESTRUCTION
MY EYES FLEW TOWARD THE CLOCK IT WAS ELEVEN IN THE MORNING IT HAD TO BE MARCH TWENTY EIGHTH THE NAUTILUS WAS TRAVELING AT THE FRIGHTFUL SPEED OF FORTY MILES PER HOUR IT WAS WRITHING IN THE WATERS
CONSEIL PUT IN YES NED LAND WENT ON YOU CAN REPAY YOUR DEBT BY COMING WITH ME WHEN I LEAVE THIS INFERNAL NAUTILUS BY THE WAY CONSEIL SAID ARE WE GOING IN A FAVORABLE DIRECTION
ITS COASTLINE LOOKED FLAT BUT HIGH MOUNTAINS ROSE IN THE DISTANCE I EVEN THOUGHT I GLIMPSED MT SARMIENTO
AND THE NAUTILUS'S ATMOSPHERE WHICH WAS ALREADY CHARGED WITH CARBON DIOXIDE THE AIR HADN'T BEEN RENEWED IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND ITS LIFE GIVING QUALITIES WERE CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED MEANWHILE
THE AIR COULDN'T BE RENEWED IN THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR ACCORDINGLY THAT DAY IT KEPT GETTING WORSE AN UNBEARABLE HEAVINESS WEIGHED ME DOWN NEAR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THIS AGONIZING SENSATION AFFECTED ME TO AN INTENSE DEGREE
IF ONLY MY NAUTILUS WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO STAND THAT MUCH PRESSURE WITHOUT BEING CRUSHED WELL I ASKED NOT CATCHING THE CAPTAIN'S MEANING DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND HE WENT ON THAT THE CONGEALING OF THIS WATER
SEPARATING US FROM THE OPEN AIR WAS A MERE TRACT OF ICE COULD WE BREAK THROUGH IT
HOW IT MAY BE ASKED CAN ANY PART OF THE CONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF SOCIETY BE A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO THE OTHER MEMBERS
WHETHER HE DISPLEASES US IN THINGS IN WHICH WE THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CONTROL HIM OR IN THINGS IN WHICH WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE NOT IF HE DISPLEASES US WE MAY EXPRESS OUR DISTASTE AND WE MAY STAND ALOOF FROM A PERSON AS WELL AS FROM A THING THAT DISPLEASES US
INFLICTION ON THEM OF ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE NOT JUSTIFIED BY HIS OWN RIGHTS FALSEHOOD OR DUPLICITY IN DEALING WITH THEM UNFAIR OR UNGENEROUS USE OF ADVANTAGES OVER THEM
AND MUST TAKE CARE THAT IT BE SUFFICIENTLY SEVERE IN THE ONE CASE HE IS AN OFFENDER AT OUR BAR
IT MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE ESTABLISHMENT BY CUSTOM OF A HOLIDAY ON SOME OTHER DAY OF THE WEEK FOR THOSE PARTICULAR CLASSES OF PERSONS THE ONLY GROUND THEREFORE ON WHICH RESTRICTIONS ON SUNDAY AMUSEMENTS CAN BE DEFENDED MUST BE THAT THEY ARE RELIGIOUSLY WRONG
IT IS A DIRECT INFRACTION OF THAT PRINCIPLE BEING A MERE RIVETING OF THE CHAINS OF ONE HALF OF THE COMMUNITY AND AN EMANCIPATION OF THE OTHER FROM RECIPROCITY OF OBLIGATION TOWARDS THEM
GROSS DISGUSTING WHAT DO PROTESTANTS THINK OF THESE PERFECTLY SINCERE FEELINGS AND OF THE ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE THEM AGAINST NON CATHOLICS
THE PEOPLE OF ONE ENGLISH COLONY AND OF NEARLY HALF THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN INTERDICTED BY LAW FROM MAKING ANY USE WHATEVER OF FERMENTED DRINKS
IF PROTECTION AGAINST THEMSELVES IS CONFESSEDLY DUE TO CHILDREN AND PERSONS UNDER AGE
BUT WITHOUT DWELLING UPON SUPPOSITITIOUS CASES THERE ARE IN OUR OWN DAY GROSS USURPATIONS UPON THE LIBERTY OF PRIVATE LIFE ACTUALLY PRACTISED AND STILL GREATER ONES THREATENED WITH SOME EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS
THIS IS NEITHER POSSIBLE NOR DESIRABLE IF HE IS EMINENT IN ANY OF THE QUALITIES WHICH CONDUCE TO HIS OWN GOOD HE IS SO FAR A PROPER OBJECT OF ADMIRATION HE IS SO MUCH THE NEARER TO THE IDEAL PERFECTION OF HUMAN NATURE
AS SOON AS ANY PART OF A PERSON'S CONDUCT AFFECTS PREJUDICIALLY THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS SOCIETY HAS JURISDICTION OVER IT AND THE QUESTION WHETHER THE GENERAL WELFARE WILL OR WILL NOT BE PROMOTED BY INTERFERING WITH IT BECOMES OPEN TO DISCUSSION
NOR OCCASIONS PERCEPTIBLE HURT TO ANY ASSIGNABLE INDIVIDUAL EXCEPT HIMSELF THE INCONVENIENCE IS ONE WHICH SOCIETY CAN AFFORD TO BEAR FOR THE SAKE OF THE GREATER GOOD OF HUMAN FREEDOM IF GROWN PERSONS ARE TO BE PUNISHED FOR NOT TAKING PROPER CARE OF THEMSELVES
TO SEND AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THEM AND COMPEL THEM BY FORCE TO CONFORM TO THE OPINIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE THE ARTICLE OF THE MORMONITE DOCTRINE WHICH IS THE CHIEF PROVOCATIVE TO THE ANTIPATHY WHICH THUS BREAKS THROUGH THE ORDINARY RESTRAINTS OF RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE IS ITS SANCTION OF POLYGAMY
THAT EVERY OTHER INDIVIDUAL SHALL ACT IN EVERY RESPECT EXACTLY AS HE OUGHT THAT WHOSOEVER FAILS THEREOF IN THE SMALLEST PARTICULAR VIOLATES MY SOCIAL RIGHT AND ENTITLES ME TO DEMAND FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE REMOVAL OF THE GRIEVANCE
THOUGH NOT REQUIRED BY THEIR RELIGION
THERE ARE FEW ACTS WHICH CHRISTIANS AND EUROPEANS REGARD WITH MORE UNAFFECTED DISGUST THAN MUSSULMANS REGARD THIS PARTICULAR MODE OF SATISFYING HUNGER IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE AN OFFENCE AGAINST THEIR RELIGION
AND OPINIONS PROPOSED WHICH ASSERT AN UNLIMITED RIGHT IN THE PUBLIC NOT ONLY TO PROHIBIT BY LAW EVERYTHING WHICH IT THINKS WRONG BUT IN ORDER TO GET AT WHAT IT THINKS WRONG TO PROHIBIT ANY NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH IT ADMITS TO BE INNOCENT
THE NOTION THAT IT IS ONE MAN'S DUTY THAT ANOTHER SHOULD BE RELIGIOUS
WITHOUT DOUBT ABSTINENCE ON ONE DAY IN THE WEEK SO FAR AS THE EXIGENCIES OF LIFE PERMIT FROM THE USUAL DAILY OCCUPATION THOUGH IN NO RESPECT RELIGIOUSLY BINDING ON ANY EXCEPT JEWS IS A HIGHLY BENEFICIAL CUSTOM
IF ANYTHING INVADES MY SOCIAL RIGHTS CERTAINLY THE TRAFFIC IN STRONG DRINK DOES IT DESTROYS MY PRIMARY RIGHT OF SECURITY BY CONSTANTLY CREATING AND STIMULATING SOCIAL DISORDER IT INVADES MY RIGHT OF EQUALITY
AND SINCE THIS JUDGMENT AND FEELING ARE A FACT WHICH HE WOULD PREFER TO AVOID IT IS DOING HIM A SERVICE TO WARN HIM OF IT BEFOREHAND AS OF ANY OTHER DISAGREEABLE CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HE EXPOSES HIMSELF
OBLIGATORY ON ALL THE WORLD THE EVIL HERE POINTED OUT IS NOT ONE WHICH EXISTS ONLY IN THEORY AND IT MAY PERHAPS BE EXPECTED THAT I SHOULD SPECIFY THE INSTANCES IN WHICH THE PUBLIC OF THIS AGE AND COUNTRY IMPROPERLY INVESTS ITS OWN PREFERENCES
TO PUT AN END TO WHAT SEEMS TO HIM A RETROGRADE STEP IN CIVILISATION IT ALSO APPEARS SO TO ME BUT I AM NOT AWARE THAT ANY COMMUNITY HAS A RIGHT TO FORCE ANOTHER TO BE CIVILISED
IN ORDER THAT PEOPLE MAY KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO EXPECT BUT IN EACH PERSON'S OWN CONCERNS HIS INDIVIDUAL SPONTANEITY IS ENTITLED TO FREE EXERCISE CONSIDERATIONS TO AID HIS JUDGMENT EXHORTATIONS TO STRENGTHEN HIS WILL MAY BE OFFERED TO HIM
THE MORAL CULPABILITY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME GEORGE BARNWELL MURDERED HIS UNCLE TO GET MONEY FOR HIS MISTRESS BUT IF HE HAD DONE IT TO SET HIMSELF UP IN BUSINESS HE WOULD EQUALLY HAVE BEEN HANGED
IT HAS HAD THE WHOLE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD
AND PROFESS TO BE A KIND OF CHRISTIANS NO ONE HAS A DEEPER DISAPPROBATION THAN I HAVE OF THIS MORMON INSTITUTION
IF THIS BE SO THE SOONER SUCH A CIVILISATION RECEIVES NOTICE TO QUIT THE BETTER IT CAN ONLY GO ON FROM BAD TO WORSE UNTIL DESTROYED AND REGENERATED LIKE THE WESTERN EMPIRE BY ENERGETIC BARBARIANS
DISSIMULATION AND INSINCERITY IRASCIBILITY ON INSUFFICIENT CAUSE AND RESENTMENT DISPROPORTIONED TO THE PROVOCATION THE LOVE OF DOMINEERING OVER OTHERS THE DESIRE TO ENGROSS MORE THAN ONE'S SHARE OF ADVANTAGES
AND HAS BEEN MADE THE FOUNDATION OF A SOCIETY IN THE AGE OF NEWSPAPERS RAILWAYS AND THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH WHAT HERE CONCERNS US IS
OR OTHER PREPONDERATING POWER IN THE COUNTRY AND ALL PERSONS MUST BE READY TO CONFORM TO THE IDEA OF A CHRISTIAN COMMONWEALTH AS UNDERSTOOD BY THE EARLY SETTLERS IN NEW ENGLAND IF A RELIGIOUS PROFESSION SIMILAR TO THEIRS
AND IF ADMITTED WOULD FULLY JUSTIFY THEM
THAT IS OF AN OVERRULING MAJORITY THOUGH OFTEN WRONG IS LIKELY TO BE STILL OFTENER RIGHT BECAUSE ON SUCH QUESTIONS THEY ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO JUDGE OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH SOME MODE OF CONDUCT IF ALLOWED TO BE PRACTISED WOULD AFFECT THEMSELVES
THEIR AVERSION TO THE FLESH OF THE UNCLEAN BEAST IS ON THE CONTRARY OF THAT PECULIAR CHARACTER RESEMBLING AN INSTINCTIVE ANTIPATHY WHICH THE IDEA OF UNCLEANNESS
WHO HAVE NO PART OR CONCERN IN IT LET THEM SEND MISSIONARIES IF THEY PLEASE TO PREACH AGAINST IT AND LET THEM BY ANY FAIR MEANS OF WHICH SILENCING THE TEACHERS IS NOT ONE OPPOSE THE PROGRESS OF SIMILAR DOCTRINES AMONG THEIR OWN PEOPLE
THERE MUST BE SOME LENGTH OF TIME AND AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE AFTER WHICH A MORAL OR PRUDENTIAL TRUTH MAY BE REGARDED AS ESTABLISHED AND IT IS MERELY DESIRED TO PREVENT GENERATION AFTER GENERATION FROM FALLING OVER THE SAME PRECIPICE
I AM NOT WRITING AN ESSAY ON THE ABERRATIONS OF EXISTING MORAL FEELING THAT IS TOO WEIGHTY A SUBJECT TO BE DISCUSSED PARENTHETICALLY
EXCEPT PERHAPS TO THAT OF HOLDING OPINIONS IN SECRET WITHOUT EVER DISCLOSING THEM FOR
THE SMALL NUMBER WHO FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF OTHERS MUST STILL WORK OBTAIN A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE OF EARNINGS AND THEY ARE NOT OBLIGED TO FOLLOW THOSE OCCUPATIONS IF THEY PREFER LEISURE TO EMOLUMENT IF A FURTHER REMEDY IS SOUGHT
OR WHO CAN BLAME PEOPLE FOR DESIRING TO SUPPRESS WHAT THEY REGARD AS A SCANDAL IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND MAN NO STRONGER CASE CAN BE SHOWN FOR PROHIBITING ANYTHING WHICH IS REGARDED AS A PERSONAL IMMORALITY
BUT WHEN THE DISSENTIENTS HAVE CONCEDED TO THE HOSTILE SENTIMENTS OF OTHERS FAR MORE THAN COULD JUSTLY BE DEMANDED WHEN THEY HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRIES TO WHICH THEIR DOCTRINES WERE UNACCEPTABLE AND ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN A REMOTE CORNER OF THE EARTH
WHO ARE THE ASCENDANT POWER IN THE PRESENT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITION OF THE KINGDOM IT IS BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE THAT PERSONS OF THESE SENTIMENTS MAY AT SOME TIME OR OTHER COMMAND A MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT HOW WILL THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY
THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTS DO NOT THEN FALL ON HIMSELF BUT ON OTHERS AND SOCIETY AS THE PROTECTOR OF ALL ITS MEMBERS MUST RETALIATE ON HIM MUST INFLICT PAIN ON HIM FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF PUNISHMENT
WHICH ARE NOT SOCIAL BUT INDIVIDUAL ALTHOUGH IT IS TO THIS CLASS SURELY THAT THE ACT OF DRINKING FERMENTED LIQUORS BELONGS SELLING FERMENTED LIQUORS HOWEVER IS TRADING AND TRADING IS A SOCIAL ACT BUT THE INFRINGEMENT COMPLAINED OF
OR JUSTIFIED BY ALLOWABLE SELF PREFERENCE IS A SUBJECT OF MORAL DISAPPROBATION FOR THAT FAILURE BUT NOT FOR THE CAUSE OF IT NOR FOR THE ERRORS MERELY PERSONAL TO HIMSELF WHICH MAY HAVE REMOTELY LED TO IT
WE HAVE A RIGHT AND IT MAY BE OUR DUTY TO CAUTION OTHERS AGAINST HIM IF WE THINK HIS EXAMPLE OR CONVERSATION LIKELY TO HAVE A PERNICIOUS EFFECT ON THOSE WITH WHOM HE ASSOCIATES
AND ITS BEST EFFORTS ARE NOT ALWAYS IN INDIVIDUAL CASES ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL ONES BUT IT IS PERFECTLY WELL ABLE TO MAKE THE RISING GENERATION AS A WHOLE AS GOOD AS AND A LITTLE BETTER THAN ITSELF
THESE ARE MORAL VICES AND CONSTITUTE A BAD AND ODIOUS MORAL CHARACTER UNLIKE THE SELF REGARDING FAULTS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WHICH ARE NOT PROPERLY IMMORALITIES AND TO WHATEVER PITCH THEY MAY BE CARRIED DO NOT CONSTITUTE WICKEDNESS
BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE BY NO MEANS EXPLAINS EITHER THE DEGREE OR THE KIND OF THEIR REPUGNANCE FOR WINE ALSO IS FORBIDDEN BY THEIR RELIGION AND TO PARTAKE OF IT IS BY ALL MUSSULMANS ACCOUNTED WRONG BUT NOT DISGUSTING
HARDLY ANY OFFENCE THAT IS COMMITTED WOULD DETRACT MORE FROM THE GENERAL SUM OF GOOD FINALLY IF BY HIS VICES OR FOLLIES A PERSON DOES NO DIRECT HARM TO OTHERS HE IS NEVERTHELESS IT MAY BE SAID INJURIOUS BY HIS EXAMPLE
THE OPERATIVES ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT IN THINKING THAT IF ALL WORKED ON SUNDAY SEVEN DAYS WORK WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN FOR SIX DAYS WAGES BUT SO LONG AS THE GREAT MASS OF EMPLOYMENTS ARE SUSPENDED
AND EVEN IF RIGHT ARE AS LIKELY AS NOT TO BE MISAPPLIED TO INDIVIDUAL CASES
NOR IS THERE ANYTHING WHICH TENDS MORE TO DISCREDIT AND FRUSTRATE THE BETTER MEANS OF INFLUENCING CONDUCT THAN A RESORT TO THE WORSE IF THERE BE AMONG THOSE WHOM IT IS ATTEMPTED TO COERCE INTO PRUDENCE OR TEMPERANCE ANY OF THE MATERIAL
BUT ON THAT OF THE BUYER AND CONSUMER SINCE THE STATE MIGHT JUST AS WELL FORBID HIM TO DRINK WINE AS PURPOSELY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OBTAIN IT THE SECRETARY HOWEVER SAYS
BINDING ON OURSELVES AND ON ALL OTHERS WHAT CAN THE POOR PUBLIC DO BUT APPLY THESE INSTRUCTIONS AND MAKE THEIR OWN PERSONAL FEELINGS OF GOOD AND EVIL IF THEY ARE TOLERABLY
EFFECTUAL SUMPTUARY LAW AND THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE UNION IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR A PERSON POSSESSING A VERY LARGE INCOME TO FIND ANY MODE OF SPENDING IT WHICH WILL NOT INCUR POPULAR DISAPPROBATION
FLYING FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY BEFORE THE CALIPHS ARRIVED IN WESTERN INDIA THEY WERE ADMITTED TO TOLERATION BY THE HINDOO SOVEREIGNS ON CONDITION OF NOT EATING BEEF
THE NEXT EXAMPLE HOWEVER SHALL BE TAKEN FROM AN INTERFERENCE WITH LIBERTY WHICH WE HAVE BY NO MEANS PASSED ALL DANGER OF WHEREVER THE PURITANS HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL AS IN NEW ENGLAND AND IN GREAT BRITAIN AT THE TIME OF THE COMMONWEALTH
A CIVILISATION THAT CAN THUS SUCCUMB TO ITS VANQUISHED ENEMY MUST FIRST HAVE BECOME SO DEGENERATE THAT NEITHER ITS APPOINTED PRIESTS AND TEACHERS NOR ANYBODY ELSE HAS THE CAPACITY OR WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO STAND UP FOR IT
EVERY ONE WHO RECEIVES THE PROTECTION OF SOCIETY OWES A RETURN FOR THE BENEFIT AND THE FACT OF LIVING IN SOCIETY RENDERS IT INDISPENSABLE THAT EACH SHOULD BE BOUND TO OBSERVE A CERTAIN LINE OF CONDUCT TOWARDS THE REST THIS CONDUCT CONSISTS FIRST
SHOULD EVER SUCCEED IN REGAINING ITS LOST GROUND AS RELIGIONS SUPPOSED TO BE DECLINING HAVE SO OFTEN BEEN KNOWN TO DO TO IMAGINE ANOTHER CONTINGENCY PERHAPS MORE LIKELY TO BE REALISED THAN THE ONE LAST MENTIONED
WHEN ONCE IT THOROUGHLY SINKS INTO THE FEELINGS SEEMS ALWAYS TO EXCITE EVEN IN THOSE WHOSE PERSONAL HABITS ARE ANYTHING BUT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEANLY AND OF WHICH THE SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS IMPURITY SO INTENSE IN THE HINDOOS IS A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE
HOW MUCH OF HUMAN LIFE SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO INDIVIDUALITY AND HOW MUCH TO SOCIETY EACH WILL RECEIVE ITS PROPER SHARE IF EACH HAS THAT WHICH MORE PARTICULARLY CONCERNS IT
THERE ARE STILL IN THIS COUNTRY LARGE BODIES OF PERSONS BY WHOSE NOTIONS OF MORALITY AND RELIGION THESE RECREATIONS ARE CONDEMNED AND THOSE PERSONS BELONGING CHIEFLY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS
I CLAIM AS A CITIZEN A RIGHT TO LEGISLATE WHENEVER MY SOCIAL RIGHTS ARE INVADED BY THE SOCIAL ACT OF ANOTHER
SOME PEOPLE'S OPINION OF WHAT IS GOOD OR BAD FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHILE VERY OFTEN IT DOES NOT EVEN MEAN THAT THE PUBLIC WITH THE MOST PERFECT INDIFFERENCE PASSING OVER THE PLEASURE OR CONVENIENCE OF THOSE WHOSE CONDUCT THEY CENSURE AND CONSIDERING ONLY THEIR OWN PREFERENCE
WHICH SOCIETY DOES NOT PRETEND IT HAS A RIGHT TO EXACT BUT I CANNOT CONSENT TO ARGUE THE POINT AS IF SOCIETY HAD NO MEANS OF BRINGING ITS WEAKER MEMBERS UP TO ITS ORDINARY STANDARD OF RATIONAL CONDUCT EXCEPT WAITING TILL THEY DO SOMETHING IRRATIONAL
AS DRAWN FROM CONTINGENCIES IMPOSSIBLE AMONG US OPINION IN THIS COUNTRY NOT BEING LIKELY TO ENFORCE ABSTINENCE FROM MEATS OR TO INTERFERE WITH PEOPLE FOR WORSHIPPING AND FOR EITHER MARRYING OR NOT MARRYING ACCORDING TO THEIR CREED OR INCLINATION
AND EVEN IT WILL BE ADDED IF THE CONSEQUENCES OF MISCONDUCT COULD BE CONFINED TO THE VICIOUS OR THOUGHTLESS INDIVIDUAL OUGHT SOCIETY TO ABANDON TO THEIR OWN GUIDANCE THOSE WHO ARE MANIFESTLY UNFIT FOR IT
THEY SHOULD BE FOR EVER STIMULATING EACH OTHER TO INCREASED EXERCISE OF THEIR HIGHER FACULTIES AND INCREASED DIRECTION OF THEIR FEELINGS AND AIMS TOWARDS WISE INSTEAD OF FOOLISH ELEVATING INSTEAD OF DEGRADING OBJECTS AND CONTEMPLATIONS
WE ARE NOT BOUND FOR EXAMPLE TO SEEK HIS SOCIETY WE HAVE A RIGHT TO AVOID IT THOUGH NOT TO PARADE THE AVOIDANCE FOR WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE SOCIETY MOST ACCEPTABLE TO US
WE MUST BEWARE OF ADMITTING A PRINCIPLE OF WHICH WE SHOULD RESENT AS A GROSS INJUSTICE THE APPLICATION TO OURSELVES THE PRECEDING INSTANCES MAY BE OBJECTED TO ALTHOUGH UNREASONABLY
WHEN THE PERIOD OF EDUCATION IS PAST THE SELF REGARDING VIRTUES SHOULD BE INCULCATED HUMAN BEINGS OWE TO EACH OTHER HELP TO DISTINGUISH THE BETTER FROM THE WORSE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO CHOOSE THE FORMER AND AVOID THE LATTER
A RECENT WRITER IN SOME RESPECTS OF CONSIDERABLE MERIT PROPOSES TO USE HIS OWN WORDS NOT A CRUSADE BUT A CIVILIZADE AGAINST THIS POLYGAMOUS COMMUNITY
IF WE DO NOT INTERFERE BENEVOLENTLY BY SHOWING INTEREST OR CONCERN FOR HIM IT IS FAR OTHERWISE IF HE HAS INFRINGED THE RULES NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY
AND I DO NOT SEE HOW THOSE WHO BELIEVE THIS CAN THINK OTHERWISE THAN THAT THE EXAMPLE ON THE WHOLE MUST BE MORE SALUTARY THAN HURTFUL SINCE IF IT DISPLAYS THE MISCONDUCT
NO MORE THAN BETWEEN THE DESIRE OF A THIEF TO TAKE A PURSE AND THE DESIRE OF THE RIGHT OWNER TO KEEP IT AND A PERSON'S TASTE IS AS MUCH HIS OWN PECULIAR CONCERN AS HIS OPINION OR HIS PURSE
WHY IT MAY BE ASKED SHOULD NOT LAW SO FAR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH PRACTICABILITY AND SOCIAL CONVENIENCE ENDEAVOUR TO REPRESS THESE ALSO AND AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE UNAVOIDABLE IMPERFECTIONS OF LAW
TO AGITATE FOR A SIMILAR LAW IN THIS COUNTRY THE ASSOCIATION OR ALLIANCE AS IT TERMS ITSELF WHICH HAS BEEN FORMED FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS ACQUIRED SOME NOTORIETY
IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL OF ALL HUMAN PROPENSITIES AS A FIRST INSTANCE CONSIDER THE ANTIPATHIES WHICH MEN CHERISH ON NO BETTER GROUNDS THAN THAT PERSONS WHOSE RELIGIOUS OPINIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THEIRS DO NOT PRACTISE THEIR RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
WE HAVE A RIGHT ALSO IN VARIOUS WAYS TO ACT UPON OUR UNFAVOURABLE OPINION OF ANY ONE NOT TO THE OPPRESSION OF HIS INDIVIDUALITY BUT IN THE EXERCISE OF OURS
AND HOWEVER SURPRISING THIS FACT MAY APPEAR IT HAS ITS EXPLANATION IN THE COMMON IDEAS AND CUSTOMS OF THE WORLD WHICH TEACHING WOMEN TO THINK MARRIAGE THE ONE THING NEEDFUL MAKE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT MANY A WOMAN SHOULD PREFER BEING ONE OF SEVERAL WIVES
BY SUSPENDING THE GREATER OPERATIONS OF INDUSTRY ON A PARTICULAR DAY BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION GROUNDED ON THE DIRECT INTEREST WHICH OTHERS HAVE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL'S OBSERVANCE OF THE PRACTICE
AND THE REPROBATION WHICH IS DUE TO HIM FOR AN OFFENCE AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS IS NOT A MERELY NOMINAL DISTINCTION IT MAKES A VAST DIFFERENCE BOTH IN OUR FEELINGS AND IN OUR CONDUCT TOWARDS HIM
BUT WHERE HAS THERE BEEN SEEN A PUBLIC WHICH SET ANY SUCH LIMIT TO ITS CENSORSHIP OR WHEN DOES THE PUBLIC TROUBLE ITSELF ABOUT UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE IN ITS INTERFERENCES WITH PERSONAL CONDUCT IT IS SELDOM THINKING OF ANYTHING
UNDERTAKES TO POINT OUT THE BROAD AND IMPASSABLE BARRIER WHICH DIVIDES SUCH PRINCIPLES FROM THOSE OF THE ASSOCIATION ALL MATTERS RELATING TO THOUGHT OPINION CONSCIENCE APPEAR TO ME HE SAYS TO BE WITHOUT THE SPHERE OF LEGISLATION
DIIS CURAE IT REMAINS TO BE PROVED THAT SOCIETY OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS HOLDS A COMMISSION FROM ON HIGH TO AVENGE ANY SUPPOSED OFFENCE TO OMNIPOTENCE WHICH IS NOT ALSO A WRONG TO OUR FELLOW CREATURES
BUT WHICH DOES NOT AFFECT THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH HIM ACTS INJURIOUS TO OTHERS REQUIRE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TREATMENT ENCROACHMENT ON THEIR RIGHTS
THAT THEY WERE FORCIBLY EXPELLED IN A BODY FROM THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY FIRST GREW UP WHILE NOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CHASED INTO A SOLITARY RECESS IN THE MIDST OF A DESERT MANY IN THIS COUNTRY OPENLY DECLARE THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT ONLY THAT IT IS NOT CONVENIENT
THAT THIS RELIGION LIKE OTHER AND BETTER RELIGIONS HAS ITS MARTYRS THAT ITS PROPHET AND FOUNDER WAS FOR HIS TEACHING PUT TO DEATH BY A MOB THAT OTHERS OF ITS ADHERENTS LOST THEIR LIVES BY THE SAME LAWLESS VIOLENCE
BY DERIVING A PROFIT FROM THE CREATION OF A MISERY I AM TAXED TO SUPPORT IT IMPEDES MY RIGHT TO FREE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT BY SURROUNDING MY PATH WITH DANGERS AND BY WEAKENING AND DEMORALISING SOCIETY
THERE ARE MANY WHO CONSIDER AS AN INJURY TO THEMSELVES ANY CONDUCT WHICH THEY HAVE A DISTASTE FOR AND RESENT IT AS AN OUTRAGE TO THEIR FEELINGS AS A RELIGIOUS BIGOT WHEN CHARGED WITH DISREGARDING THE RELIGIOUS FEELINGS OF OTHERS
MERELY FROM WITHOUT IN THIS DEPARTMENT THEREFORE OF HUMAN AFFAIRS INDIVIDUALITY HAS ITS PROPER FIELD OF ACTION IN THE CONDUCT OF HUMAN BEINGS TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER IT IS NECESSARY THAT GENERAL RULES SHOULD FOR THE MOST PART BE OBSERVED
IN SOME OF HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCES UNHAPPILY ARE AMONG THOSE WHO FIGURE IN POLITICAL LIFE THE ORGAN OF THE ALLIANCE WHO WOULD DEEPLY DEPLORE THE RECOGNITION OF ANY PRINCIPLE WHICH COULD BE WRESTED TO JUSTIFY BIGOTRY AND PERSECUTION
BUT THE OPINION OF A SIMILAR MAJORITY IMPOSED AS A LAW ON THE MINORITY ON QUESTIONS OF SELF REGARDING CONDUCT IS QUITE AS LIKELY TO BE WRONG AS RIGHT FOR IN THESE CASES PUBLIC OPINION MEANS AT THE BEST
NOT SIMPLY THREATENED BUT LONG SINCE CARRIED INTO TRIUMPHANT EFFECT
A THEORY OF SOCIAL RIGHTS THE LIKE OF WHICH PROBABLY NEVER BEFORE FOUND ITS WAY INTO DISTINCT LANGUAGE BEING NOTHING SHORT OF THIS THAT IT IS THE ABSOLUTE SOCIAL RIGHT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL
WHICH HAS BEEN FATAL TO THEIR PREDECESSORS I FULLY ADMIT THAT THE MISCHIEF WHICH A PERSON DOES TO HIMSELF MAY SERIOUSLY AFFECT BOTH THROUGH THEIR SYMPATHIES AND THEIR INTERESTS THOSE NEARLY CONNECTED WITH HIM
TO INDIVIDUALITY SHOULD BELONG THE PART OF LIFE IN WHICH IT IS CHIEFLY THE INDIVIDUAL THAT IS INTERESTED TO SOCIETY THE PART WHICH CHIEFLY INTERESTS SOCIETY THOUGH SOCIETY IS NOT FOUNDED ON A CONTRACT
AND THAT NO ONE OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED THROUGH PIECEWORK OR OTHERWISE TO EARN BY SUPERIOR SKILL OR INDUSTRY MORE THAN OTHERS CAN WITHOUT IT AND THEY EMPLOY A MORAL POLICE WHICH OCCASIONALLY BECOMES A PHYSICAL ONE TO DETER SKILFUL WORKMEN FROM RECEIVING
THOUGH THE PHRASE IS NOT UNOBJECTIONABLE LOWNESS OR DEPRAVATION OF TASTE
IT IS EASY FOR ANY ONE TO IMAGINE AN IDEAL PUBLIC WHICH LEAVES THE FREEDOM AND CHOICE OF INDIVIDUALS IN ALL UNCERTAIN MATTERS UNDISTURBED AND ONLY REQUIRES THEM TO ABSTAIN FROM MODES OF CONDUCT WHICH UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE HAS CONDEMNED
HE MAY BE TO US AN OBJECT OF PITY PERHAPS OF DISLIKE BUT NOT OF ANGER OR RESENTMENT WE SHALL NOT TREAT HIM LIKE AN ENEMY OF SOCIETY THE WORST WE SHALL THINK OURSELVES JUSTIFIED IN DOING IS LEAVING HIM TO HIMSELF
BUT NEITHER ONE PERSON NOR ANY NUMBER OF PERSONS IS WARRANTED IN SAYING TO ANOTHER HUMAN CREATURE OF RIPE YEARS THAT HE SHALL NOT DO WITH HIS LIFE FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT WHAT HE CHOOSES TO DO WITH IT HE IS THE PERSON MOST INTERESTED IN HIS OWN WELL BEING
FOR PROHIBITION OF THEIR SALE IS IN FACT AS IT IS INTENDED TO BE PROHIBITION OF THEIR USE AND THOUGH THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF EXECUTING THE LAW HAS CAUSED ITS REPEAL IN SEVERAL OF THE STATES WHICH HAD ADOPTED IT
AND IT EASILY COMES TO BE CONSIDERED A MARK OF SPIRIT AND COURAGE TO FLY IN THE FACE OF SUCH USURPED AUTHORITY AND DO WITH OSTENTATION THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT ENJOINS AS IN THE FASHION OF GROSSNESS WHICH SUCCEEDED IN THE TIME OF CHARLES TWO
BUT THERE IS NO ROOM FOR ENTERTAINING ANY SUCH QUESTION WHEN A PERSON'S CONDUCT AFFECTS THE INTERESTS OF NO PERSONS BESIDES HIMSELF OR NEEDS NOT AFFECT THEM UNLESS THEY LIKE
VESTED IN THE STATE ITSELF AND NOT IN THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE WITHIN IT NO MENTION IS MADE OF A THIRD CLASS DIFFERENT FROM EITHER OF THESE
CHAPTER FOUR OF THE LIMITS TO THE AUTHORITY OF SOCIETY OVER THE INDIVIDUAL WHAT THEN IS THE RIGHTFUL LIMIT TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL OVER HIMSELF
WHO ARE EQUALLY INCAPABLE OF SELF GOVERNMENT IF GAMBLING OR DRUNKENNESS OR INCONTINENCE OR IDLENESS OR UNCLEANLINESS ARE AS INJURIOUS TO HAPPINESS AND AS GREAT A HINDRANCE TO IMPROVEMENT AS MANY OR MOST OF THE ACTS PROHIBITED BY LAW
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE PURPOSELY INFLICTED ON HIM FOR THE SAKE OF PUNISHMENT A PERSON WHO SHOWS RASHNESS OBSTINACY SELF CONCEIT WHO CANNOT LIVE WITHIN MODERATE MEANS WHO CANNOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF FROM HURTFUL INDULGENCES
THAT THE INCONVENIENCES WHICH ARE STRICTLY INSEPARABLE FROM THE UNFAVOURABLE JUDGMENT OF OTHERS ARE THE ONLY ONES TO WHICH A PERSON SHOULD EVER BE SUBJECTED FOR THAT PORTION OF HIS CONDUCT AND CHARACTER WHICH CONCERNS HIS OWN GOOD
AND USUALLY DIMINISHES BY A GREATER OR LESS AMOUNT THE GENERAL RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY IF HE DETERIORATES HIS BODILY OR MENTAL FACULTIES HE NOT ONLY BRINGS EVIL UPON ALL WHO DEPENDED ON HIM FOR ANY PORTION OF THEIR HAPPINESS
TO THE FANATICAL MORAL INTOLERANCE OF THE PURITANS WITH RESPECT TO WHAT IS SAID OF THE NECESSITY OF PROTECTING SOCIETY FROM THE BAD EXAMPLE SET TO OTHERS BY THE VICIOUS OR THE SELF INDULGENT IT IS TRUE THAT BAD EXAMPLE MAY HAVE A PERNICIOUS EFFECT
BUT THE ENORMITY OF ACTING OR FEELING DIFFERENTLY FROM ITSELF AND THIS STANDARD OF JUDGMENT THINLY DISGUISED IS HELD UP TO MANKIND AS THE DICTATE OF RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY BY NINE TENTHS OF ALL MORALISTS AND SPECULATIVE WRITERS
COMBINED WITH THE NOTION THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO A VETO ON THE MANNER IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS SHALL SPEND THEIR INCOMES WE HAVE ONLY FURTHER TO SUPPOSE A CONSIDERABLE DIFFUSION OF SOCIALIST OPINIONS
AND WITH STOCKINGLESS FEET SHE FOLLOWED THE POOR STRAW COFFIN IN THEM SUDDENLY A LARGE OLD CARRIAGE DROVE UP AND A LARGE OLD LADY SAT IN IT SHE LOOKED AT THE LITTLE GIRL FELT COMPASSION FOR HER
BUT KAREN HERSELF WAS CLEANLY AND NICELY DRESSED SHE MUST LEARN TO READ AND SEW AND PEOPLE SAID SHE WAS A NICE LITTLE THING BUT THE LOOKING GLASS SAID THOU ART MORE THAN NICE THOU ART BEAUTIFUL
AND HAD HE NOT COME INTO A WARM ROOM HE WOULD MOST CERTAINLY HAVE PERISHED IN THE FRIGHTFUL TEMPEST POOR CHILD SAID THE OLD POET AS HE TOOK THE BOY BY THE HAND COME IN COME IN AND I WILL SOON RESTORE THEE
AND STRAIGHT BEFORE HER STOOD THE ANGEL OF GOD IN WHITE GARMENTS THE SAME SHE HAD SEEN THAT NIGHT AT THE CHURCH DOOR BUT HE NO LONGER CARRIED THE SHARP SWORD BUT IN ITS STEAD A SPLENDID GREEN SPRAY FULL OF ROSES
AND WHO HAD GIVEN HIM WARM WINE AND THE VERY BEST APPLES THE POOR POET LAY ON THE EARTH AND WEPT FOR THE ARROW HAD REALLY FLOWN INTO HIS HEART
HERE SHE KNEW DWELT THE EXECUTIONER AND SHE TAPPED WITH HER FINGERS AT THE WINDOW AND SAID COME OUT COME OUT I CANNOT COME IN FOR I AM FORCED TO DANCE AND THE EXECUTIONER SAID
AND SHE WAS FORCED TO DANCE THROUGH THE GLOOMY NIGHT THE SHOES CARRIED HER OVER STACK AND STONE SHE WAS TORN TILL SHE BLED SHE DANCED OVER THE HEATH TILL SHE CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE
EVERYBODY LOOKED AT HER FEET AND WHEN SHE STEPPED THROUGH THE CHANCEL DOOR ON THE CHURCH PAVEMENT IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF THE OLD FIGURES ON THE TOMBS THOSE PORTRAITS OF OLD PREACHERS AND PREACHERS WIVES
BEFORE MAN'S MYSTERY OVERWROUGHT YET NOT UNFAITHFUL NOR UNKIND WITH WORK DAY VIRTUES SURELY STAID THEIRS IS THE SANE AND HUMBLE MIND AND DULL AFFECTIONS UNDISMAYED
WITH HOLLOW SOUNDS OF WINTRY FEAR AND THROUGH THE WATERS WASTE AND GREY THICK STROWN FOR MANY A LEAGUE AWAY OUT OF THE TOILING SEA AROSE MANY A FACE AND FORM OF THOSE
WARMED HIS HANDS BETWEEN HIS OWN AND BOILED FOR HIM SOME SWEET WINE THEN THE BOY RECOVERED HIS CHEEKS AGAIN GREW ROSY HE JUMPED DOWN FROM THE LAP WHERE HE WAS SITTING
THEN SUDDENLY AGAIN THE ROOM FAMILIAR BOOKS ABOUT ME PILED AND I ALONE AMID THE GLOOM BY ONE MORE MOCKING DREAM BEGUILED AND STILL NO NEARED TO THE LIGHT
AND WHILST SHE READ WITH A PIOUS MIND THE WIND BORE THE STRAINS OF THE ORGAN TOWARDS HER AND SHE RAISED HER TEARFUL COUNTENANCE AND SAID O GOD HELP ME AND THE SUN SHONE SO CLEARLY
REJOICING IN EACH OTHER'S PRAISE RESPECTABLE AND INNOCENT WHO FEEL THE THINGS THAT ALL MEN FEEL AND THINK IN WELL WORN GROOVES OF THOUGHT WHOSE HONEST SPIRITS NEVER REEL
IN A WINDOW AND LET HERSELF BE STARED AT SHE HAD NEITHER A TRAIN NOR A GOLDEN CROWN BUT SPLENDID RED MOROCCO SHOES THEY WERE CERTAINLY FAR HANDSOMER
IN BLOODY FIELDS SAD SEAS AND COUNTRIES DESOLATE YET MOST I FEAR THAT EMPTY HOUSE WHERE THE GRASSES GREEN GROW IN THE SILENT COURT THE GAPING FLAGS BETWEEN
OR ELSE SHE HAD COME INTO THE CHURCH SHE SAT IN THE PEW WITH THE CLERGYMAN'S FAMILY AND WHEN THEY HAD ENDED THE PSALM AND LOOKED UP THEY NODDED AND SAID IT IS RIGHT THAT THOU ART COME IT WAS THROUGH MERCY SHE SAID
HE HAD WINGS WHICH REACHED FROM HIS SHOULDERS TO THE EARTH HIS COUNTENANCE WAS SEVERE AND GRAVE AND IN HIS HAND HE HELD A SWORD BROAD AND GLITTERING DANCE SHALT THOU SAID HE
THE FAMILY WENT TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD BUT SHE WENT ALONE INTO HER LITTLE CHAMBER THERE WAS ONLY ROOM FOR A BED AND CHAIR TO STAND IN IT AND HERE SHE SAT DOWN WITH HER PRAYER BOOK
SHE DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE WAGES ONLY SHE WISHED TO HAVE A HOME AND BE WITH GOOD PEOPLE
AND HOMELESS LONGING VEXES ME FOR LORE THAT I SHALL NEVER KNOW AND VISIONS NONE CAN HOPE TO SEE TILL BROODING WORKS UPON ME SO A CHILDISH FEAR STEALS OVER ME I LOOK AROUND THE EMPTY ROOM
AND THEY WALK ALONG WITH HIM ARM IN ARM AS IF HE TOO WERE A STUDENT LIKE THEMSELVES AND THEN UNPERCEIVED HE THRUSTS AN ARROW TO THEIR BOSOM WHEN THE YOUNG MAIDENS COME FROM BEING EXAMINED BY THE CLERGYMAN
LEAP IN LEAP IN AND TAKE THY FILL OF ALL THE COSMIC GOOD AND ILL BE AS THE LIVING ONES THAT KNOW ENORMOUS JOY ENORMOUS WOE PAIN BEYOND THOUGHT AND FIERY BLISS
BUT THE OLD POET SAT WARM AND COMFORTABLE IN HIS CHIMNEY CORNER WHERE THE FIRE BLAZED AND THE ROASTING APPLE HISSED THOSE WHO HAVE NOT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS WILL BE WETTED TO THE SKIN SAID THE GOOD OLD POET
WITH STIFF RUFFS AND LONG BLACK DRESSES FIXED THEIR EYES ON HER RED SHOES AND SHE THOUGHT ONLY OF THEM AS THE CLERGYMAN LAID HIS HAND UPON HER HEAD AND SPOKE OF THE HOLY BAPTISM OF THE COVENANT WITH GOD
WHEN THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS COME FROM THE LECTURES HE RUNS BESIDE THEM IN A BLACK COAT AND WITH A BOOK UNDER HIS ARM IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO KNOW HIM
SHE DANCED OVER THE CHURCHYARD BUT THE DEAD DID NOT DANCE THEY HAD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO DANCE
ALL THIS LOOKED CHARMING BUT THE OLD LADY COULD NOT SEE WELL AND SO HAD NO PLEASURE IN THEM IN THE MIDST OF THE SHOES STOOD A PAIR OF RED ONES JUST LIKE THOSE THE PRINCESS HAD WORN HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY WERE
AND THE ORGAN PEALED AND THE CHILDREN'S VOICES IN THE CHOIR SOUNDED SO SWEET AND SOFT THE CLEAR SUNSHINE STREAMED SO WARMLY THROUGH THE WINDOW INTO THE PEW WHERE KAREN SAT HER HEART WAS SO FULL OF SUNSHINE PEACE
THE FIERCE COLD EYES OF GODHEAD GLEAM REVOLVING HATE AND MISERY AND WARS AND FAMINES YET TO BE AND IN MY DREAMS I STOOD ALONE UPON A SHELF OF WEEDY STONE
ALEXANDRINES THERE IS A HOUSE THAT MOST OF ALL ON EARTH I HATE THOUGH I HAVE PASSED THROUGH MANY SORROWS AND HAVE BEEN
AND HE CARVED OUT LITTLE WOODEN FEET FOR HER AND CRUTCHES TAUGHT HER THE PSALM CRIMINALS ALWAYS SING AND SHE KISSED THE HAND WHICH HAD WIELDED THE AXE AND WENT OVER THE HEATH
AND THEN SAID TO THE CLERGYMAN HERE GIVE ME THE LITTLE GIRL I WILL ADOPT HER AND KAREN BELIEVED ALL THIS HAPPENED ON ACCOUNT OF THE RED SHOES BUT THE OLD LADY THOUGHT THEY WERE HORRIBLE AND THEY WERE BURNT
SHE SAW THE OLD PICTURES OF THE PREACHERS AND THE PREACHERS WIVES THE CONGREGATION SAT IN CUSHIONED SEATS AND SANG OUT OF THEIR PRAYER BOOKS FOR THE CHURCH ITSELF HAD COME TO THE POOR GIRL IN HER NARROW CHAMBER
AND THE TINTS OF HIS MANY COLORED ARROWS RAN ONE INTO THE OTHER THE OLD POET SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HIS HEARTH AND TOOK THE LITTLE FELLOW ON HIS LAP HE SQUEEZED THE WATER OUT OF HIS DRIPPING HAIR
SHE MUST BE NURSED AND WAITED UPON AND THERE WAS NO ONE WHOSE DUTY IT WAS SO MUCH AS KAREN'S BUT THERE WAS A GREAT BALL IN THE CITY TO WHICH KAREN WAS INVITED SHE LOOKED AT THE OLD LADY WHO COULD NOT RECOVER
THOU DOST NOT KNOW WHO I AM I FANCY I STRIKE BAD PEOPLE'S HEADS OFF AND I HEAR THAT MY AXE RINGS DON'T STRIKE MY HEAD OFF SAID KAREN THEN I CAN'T REPENT OF MY SINS
IN PRAISE OF SOLID PEOPLE THANK
AND SHE PULLED DOWN HER STOCKINGS BUT THE SHOES SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN TO HER FEET AND SHE DANCED AND MUST DANCE OVER FIELDS AND MEADOWS IN RAIN AND SUNSHINE BY NIGHT AND DAY BUT AT NIGHT IT WAS THE MOST FEARFUL
THAT WERE SAD INDEED SAID THE BOY AND HE TOOK THE BOW IN HIS HAND AND EXAMINED IT ON EVERY SIDE OH IT IS DRY AGAIN AND IS NOT HURT AT ALL THE STRING IS QUITE TIGHT
BE BOLD AND DARE THE GLORIOUS LEAP OR TO THY SHAME GO SLINK AGAIN BACK TO THE NARROW WAYS OF MEN SO ALL THESE MOCKED ME AS I STOOD STRIVING TO WAKE BECAUSE I FEARED THE FLOOD
SHE LOOKED AT THE RED SHOES AND SHE THOUGHT THERE COULD BE NO SIN IN IT SHE PUT ON THE RED SHOES SHE MIGHT DO THAT ALSO SHE THOUGHT BUT THEN SHE WENT TO THE BALL AND BEGAN TO DANCE
OH LET ME IN LET ME IN I AM COLD AND I'M SO WET EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY A CHILD THAT STOOD CRYING AT THE DOOR AND KNOCKING FOR ADMITTANCE WHILE THE RAIN POURED DOWN AND THE WIND MADE ALL THE WINDOWS RATTLE
AND WENT INTO THE CHURCH WITH KAREN AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH LOOKED AT KAREN'S RED SHOES AND ALL THE PICTURES AND AS KAREN KNELT BEFORE THE ALTAR AND RAISED THE CUP TO HER LIPS
THOU SHALT HAVE WINE AND ROASTED APPLES FOR THOU ART VERILY A CHARMING CHILD AND THE BOY WAS SO REALLY HIS EYES WERE LIKE TWO BRIGHT STARS AND ALTHOUGH THE WATER TRICKLED DOWN HIS HAIR
AND SOON ANOTHER PHANTOM TIDE OF SHIFTING DREAMS BEGINS TO PLAY AND DUSKY GALLEYS PAST ME SAIL FULL FREIGHTED ON A FAERIE SEA I HEAR THE SILKEN MERCHANTS HAIL ACROSS THE RINGING WAVES TO ME
AND WHERE PROUD VAIN CHILDREN DWELL THOU SHALT KNOCK THAT THEY MAY HEAR THEE AND TREMBLE DANCE SHALT THOU MERCY CRIED KAREN BUT SHE DID NOT HEAR THE ANGEL'S REPLY
SAID THE SOLDIER SIT FIRM WHEN YOU DANCE AND HE PUT HIS HAND OUT TOWARDS THE SOLES
AND HOLDS HER HEAD SO HIGH AND AWAY SHE WENT BOLDLY BUT SHE HAD NOT GOT FARTHER THAN THE CHURCHYARD GATE BEFORE SHE SAW THE RED SHOES DANCING BEFORE HER AND SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AND TURNED BACK
IT WAVED IN BEAUTIFUL CURLS HE LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE A LITTLE ANGEL BUT HE WAS SO PALE AND HIS WHOLE BODY TREMBLED WITH COLD HE HAD A NICE LITTLE BOW IN HIS HAND BUT IT WAS QUITE SPOILED BY THE RAIN
AND DANCED ROUND THE KIND OLD POET YOU ARE A MERRY FELLOW SAID THE OLD MAN WHAT'S YOUR NAME MY NAME IS CUPID ANSWERED THE BOY DON'T YOU KNOW ME
AND REPENTED OF HER SIN FROM HER HEART AND SHE WENT TO THE PARSONAGE AND BEGGED THAT THEY WOULD TAKE HER INTO SERVICE SHE WOULD BE VERY INDUSTRIOUS SHE SAID AND WOULD DO EVERYTHING SHE COULD
WHERE SOMEONE'S ALWAYS WAITING WAITING IN THE GLOOM TO DRAW ME WITH AN EVIL EYE AND HOLD ME FAST YET THITHER DOOM WILL DRIVE ME AND HE WILL WIN AT LAST
THE RED SHOES THERE WAS ONCE A LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS VERY PRETTY AND DELICATE BUT IN SUMMER SHE WAS FORCED TO RUN ABOUT WITH BARE FEET
L'APPRENTI SORCIER SUDDENLY THERE CAME TO ME THE MUSIC OF A MIGHTY SEA THAT ON A BARE AND IRON SHORE THUNDERED WITH A DEEPER ROAR THAN ALL THE TIDES THAT LEAP AND RUN
BUT STRIKE OFF MY FEET IN THE RED SHOES AND THEN SHE CONFESSED HER ENTIRE SIN AND THE EXECUTIONER STRUCK OFF HER FEET WITH THE RED SHOES BUT THE SHOES DANCED AWAY WITH THE LITTLE FEET ACROSS THE FIELD INTO THE DEEP WOOD
I WILL TRY IT DIRECTLY AND HE BENT HIS BOW TOOK AIM AND SHOT AN ARROW AT THE OLD POET RIGHT INTO HIS HEART YOU SEE NOW THAT MY BOW WAS NOT SPOILED SAID HE LAUGHING
NOW I HAVE SUFFERED ENOUGH FOR THE RED SHOES SAID SHE NOW I WILL GO INTO THE CHURCH THAT PEOPLE MAY SEE ME AND SHE HASTENED TOWARDS THE CHURCH DOOR BUT WHEN SHE WAS NEAR IT THE RED SHOES DANCED BEFORE HER
AND THE OLD LADY GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE KAREN RAISED HER FOOT TO GET IN AFTER HER WHEN THE OLD SOLDIER SAID LOOK WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES AND KAREN COULD NOT HELP DANCING A STEP OR TWO
WHICH WAS MORE RED THAN WHITE AND HE BOWED TO THE GROUND AND ASKED THE OLD LADY WHETHER HE MIGHT DUST HER SHOES AND KAREN STRETCHED OUT HER LITTLE FOOT SEE WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES
FOR THE SHOES CARRIED HER THROUGH THE GATE INTO THE FIELDS ACROSS ROADS AND BRIDGES AND SHE MUST KEEP EVER DANCING ONE MORNING SHE DANCED PAST A DOOR WHICH SHE WELL KNEW WITHIN SOUNDED A PSALM
THIN ELEMENTAL PEOPLE DEAR WHO LIVE BEYOND OUR HEAVY SPHERE AND ALL AT ONCE FROM FAR AND NEAR THEY ALL HELD OUT THEIR ARMS TO ME CRYING IN THEIR MELODY
AND AWAY HE RAN THE NAUGHTY BOY TO SHOOT THE OLD POET IN THAT WAY HE WHO HAD TAKEN HIM INTO HIS WARM ROOM WHO HAD TREATED HIM SO KINDLY
NOW THE QUEEN ONCE TRAVELLED THROUGH THE LAND AND SHE HAD HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WITH HER AND THIS LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS A PRINCESS AND PEOPLE STREAMED TO THE CASTLE AND KAREN WAS THERE ALSO AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS STOOD IN HER FINE WHITE DRESS
AND HE LIFTED HER IN THE CARRIAGE BUT HER FEET CONTINUED TO DANCE SO THAT SHE TROD ON THE OLD LADY DREADFULLY AT LENGTH SHE TOOK THE SHOES OFF AND THEN HER LEGS HAD PEACE
WHERE THE BITTER TANSY GREW BUT FOR HER THERE WAS NEITHER PEACE NOR REST AND WHEN SHE DANCED TOWARDS THE OPEN CHURCH DOOR SHE SAW AN ANGEL STANDING THERE HE WORE LONG WHITE GARMENTS
AND HE TOUCHED THE CEILING WITH THE SPRAY AND THE CEILING ROSE SO HIGH AND WHERE HE HAD TOUCHED IT THERE GLEAMED A GOLDEN STAR AND HE TOUCHED THE WALLS AND THEY WIDENED OUT AND SHE SAW THE ORGAN WHICH WAS PLAYING
AND THE ORGAN PEALED SO SOLEMNLY THE SWEET CHILDREN'S VOICES SANG AND THE OLD MUSIC DIRECTORS SANG BUT KAREN ONLY THOUGHT OF HER RED SHOES
DANCE IN THY RED SHOES TILL THOU ART PALE AND COLD TILL THY SKIN SHRIVELS UP AND THOU ART A SKELETON DANCE SHALT THOU FROM DOOR TO DOOR
HE SHOT AN ARROW ONCE AT YOUR OLD GRANDMOTHER BUT THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO AND IT IS ALL PAST NOW HOWEVER A THING OF THAT SORT SHE NEVER FORGETS
THE RICH SHOEMAKER IN THE CITY TOOK THE MEASURE OF HER LITTLE FOOT THIS TOOK PLACE AT HIS HOUSE IN HIS ROOM WHERE STOOD LARGE GLASS CASES FILLED WITH ELEGANT SHOES AND BRILLIANT BOOTS
WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE TO THE RIGHT THE SHOES WOULD DANCE TO THE LEFT AND WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE UP THE ROOM THE SHOES DANCED BACK AGAIN DOWN THE STEPS INTO THE STREET AND OUT OF THE CITY GATE SHE DANCED
ON THE VERY DAY HER MOTHER WAS BURIED KAREN RECEIVED THE RED SHOES AND WORE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY WERE CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED FOR MOURNING BUT SHE HAD NO OTHERS
HE SAT THERE NODDED HIS HEAD AND SAID LOOK WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES THEN SHE WAS TERRIFIED AND WANTED TO FLING OFF THE RED SHOES BUT THEY CLUNG FAST
AND STILL NO FURTHER FROM MYSELF ALONE AND LOST IN CLINGING NIGHT THE CLOCK'S STILL TICKING ON THE SHELF THEN DO I ENVY SOLID FOLK WHO SIT OF EVENINGS BY THE FIRE
A COFFIN DECKED WITH FLOWERS WAS BORNE FORTH THEN SHE KNEW THAT THE OLD LADY WAS DEAD AND FELT THAT SHE WAS ABANDONED BY ALL AND CONDEMNED BY THE ANGEL OF GOD SHE DANCED
POOR THING SAID THE OLD POET AS HE WENT TO OPEN THE DOOR THERE STOOD A LITTLE BOY QUITE NAKED AND THE WATER RAN DOWN FROM HIS LONG GOLDEN HAIR HE TREMBLED WITH COLD
WITH US BELOW THE REAL SUN BECAUSE THE PLACE WAS FAR AWAY ABOVE BEYOND OUR HOMELY DAY NEIGHBOURING CLOSE THE FROZEN CLIME WHERE OUT OF ALL THE WOODS OF TIME AMID THE FRIGHTFUL SERAPHIM
ALONG TIME AGO THERE LIVED AN OLD POET A THOROUGHLY KIND OLD POET AS HE WAS SITTING ONE EVENING IN HIS ROOM A DREADFUL STORM AROSE WITHOUT AND THE RAIN STREAMED DOWN FROM HEAVEN
SHE WAS SO POOR AND IN WINTER WEAR VERY LARGE WOODEN SHOES WHICH MADE HER LITTLE INSTEPS QUITE RED AND THAT LOOKED SO DANGEROUS
LIKE EYES OF ONE LONG DEAD THE EMPTY WINDOWS STARE AND I FEAR TO CROSS THE GARDEN I FEAR TO LINGER THERE FOR IN THAT HOUSE I KNOW A LITTLE SILENT ROOM
THE SUN SHONE GLORIOUSLY KAREN AND THE OLD LADY WALKED ALONG THE PATH THROUGH THE CORN IT WAS RATHER DUSTY THERE AT THE CHURCH DOOR STOOD AN OLD SOLDIER WITH A CRUTCH AND WITH A WONDERFULLY LONG BEARD
I WILL TELL ALL CHILDREN ABOUT HIM THAT THEY MAY TAKE CARE AND NOT PLAY WITH HIM FOR HE WILL ONLY CAUSE THEM SORROW AND MANY A HEARTACHE
IN THE AFTERNOON THE OLD LADY HEARD FROM EVERYONE THAT THE SHOES HAD BEEN RED AND SHE SAID THAT IT WAS VERY WRONG OF KAREN THAT IT WAS NOT AT ALL BECOMING AND THAT IN FUTURE KAREN SHOULD ONLY GO IN BLACK SHOES TO CHURCH
AND JOY THAT IT BROKE
WHO WATER FLOWERS AND ROLL THE LAWN AND SIT AN SEW AND TALK AND SMOKE AND SNORE ALL THROUGH THE SUMMER DAWN WHO PASS UNTROUBLED NIGHTS AND DAYS FULL FED AND SLEEPILY CONTENT
A LITTLE PAIR OF SHOES OUT OF OLD RED STRIPS OF CLOTH THEY WERE VERY CLUMSY BUT IT WAS A KIND THOUGHT THEY WERE MEANT FOR THE LITTLE GIRL THE LITTLE GIRL WAS CALLED KAREN
EVEN WHEN SHE SHOULD BE OLDER THE NEXT SUNDAY THERE WAS THE SACRAMENT AND KAREN LOOKED AT THE BLACK SHOES LOOKED AT THE RED ONES LOOKED AT THEM AGAIN AND PUT ON THE RED SHOES
ASK THEM ONLY AND YOU WILL HEAR WHAT THEY'LL TELL YOU OH HE IS A NAUGHTY BOY THAT CUPID YOU MUST NEVER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM HE IS FOREVER RUNNING AFTER EVERYBODY ONLY THINK
THE CLOCK STILL TICKING IN ITS PLACE AND ALL ELSE SILENT AS THE TOMB TILL SUDDENLY I THINK A FACE GROWS FROM THE DARKNESS JUST BESIDE I TURN AND LO IT FADES AWAY
AND WHEN SHE BEGAN HER FEET CONTINUED TO DANCE IT WAS JUST AS THOUGH THE SHOES HAD POWER OVER THEM SHE DANCED ROUND THE CHURCH CORNER SHE COULD NOT LEAVE OFF THE COACHMAN WAS OBLIGED TO RUN AFTER AND CATCH HOLD OF HER
O HAPPY PEOPLE I HAVE SEEN NO VERSE YET WRITTEN IN YOUR PRAISE AND TRUTH TO TELL THE TIME HAS BEEN I WOULD HAVE SCORNED YOUR EASY WAYS BUT NOW THRO WEARINESS AND STRIFE
I LEARN YOUR WORTHINESS INDEED THE WORLD IS BETTER FOR SUCH LIFE AS STOUT SUBURBAN PEOPLE LEAD TOO OFTEN HAVE I SAT ALONE WHEN THE WET NIGHT FALLS HEAVILY AND FRETTING WINDS AROUND ME MOAN
NOTHING IN THE WORLD CAN BE COMPARED WITH RED SHOES NOW KAREN WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BE CONFIRMED SHE HAD NEW CLOTHES AND WAS TO HAVE NEW SHOES ALSO
AND SAW BEFORE MY SHRINKING EYES THE DARK ENORMOUS BREAKERS RISE AND HOVER AND FALL WITH DEAFENING THUNDER OF THWARTED FOAM THAT ECHOED UNDER THE LEDGE THROUGH MANY A CAVERN DREAR
AND ALL GOOD CHILDREN TO WHOM HE RELATED THIS STORY TOOK GREAT HEED OF THIS NAUGHTY CUPID BUT HE MADE FOOLS OF THEM STILL FOR HE IS ASTONISHINGLY CUNNING
AND THEY FITTED AND WERE BOUGHT BUT THE OLD LADY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THEIR BEING RED ELSE SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED KAREN TO HAVE GONE IN RED SHOES TO BE CONFIRMED YET SUCH WAS THE CASE
FOR ALL THY STUDY HUNTED THIS ON WINGS OF MAGIC TO ARISE AND WASH FROM OFF THY FILMED EYES THE CLOUD OF COLD MORTALITY TO FIND THE REAL LIFE AND BE AS ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE DEEP
AND WAS FORCED TO DANCE STRAIGHT OUT INTO THE GLOOMY WOOD THEN IT WAS SUDDENLY LIGHT UP AMONG THE TREES AND SHE FANCIED IT MUST BE THE MOON FOR THERE WAS A FACE
SO THAT PEOPLE THINK IT IS REALLY A FLAME BUT THEY SOON DISCOVER IT IS SOMETHING ELSE HE ROVES ABOUT IN THE GARDEN OF THE PALACE AND UPON THE RAMPARTS YES ONCE HE EVEN SHOT YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER RIGHT IN THE HEART
AND SHE WAS INDUSTRIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL SHE SAT STILL AND LISTENED WHEN THE CLERGYMAN READ THE BIBLE IN THE EVENINGS ALL THE CHILDREN THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF HER BUT WHEN THEY SPOKE OF DRESS AND GRANDEUR AND BEAUTY
THE SHOEMAKER SAID ALSO THEY HAD BEEN MADE FOR THE CHILD OF A COUNT BUT HAD NOT FITTED THAT MUST BE PATENT LEATHER SAID THE OLD LADY THEY SHINE SO YES THEY SHINE SAID KAREN
OR GO TO CHURCH TO BE CONFIRMED THERE HE IS AGAIN CLOSE BEHIND THEM YES HE IS FOREVER FOLLOWING PEOPLE AT THE PLAY HE SITS IN THE GREAT CHANDELIER AND BURNS IN BRIGHT FLAMES
AND DOWN THE MOSS GROWN PATHS AND TERRACE NO MAN TREADS WHERE THE OLD OLD WEEDS RISE DEEP ON THE WASTE GARDEN BEDS
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY WHEN THE FAMILY WAS GOING TO CHURCH THEY ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD NOT GO WITH THEM BUT SHE GLANCED SORROWFULLY WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AT HER CRUTCHES
SHE ONLY THOUGHT OF THE RED SHOES AND THEY SEEMED TO SWIM IN IT AND SHE FORGOT TO SING HER PSALM AND SHE FORGOT TO PRAY OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN NOW ALL THE PEOPLE WENT OUT OF CHURCH
THE SHOES WERE PLACED IN A CLOSET AT HOME BUT KAREN COULD NOT AVOID LOOKING AT THEM NOW THE OLD LADY WAS SICK
FOR NOT ONLY DID THEY CEASE TO DRAW ANY NEARER BUT THE BIRDS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO GROW MORE QUIET AND TO SETTLE AGAIN TO THEIR PLACES IN THE SWAMP AND NOW I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT I WAS NEGLECTING MY BUSINESS
ALICE WAS MORE AND MORE PUZZLED BUT SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO USE IN SAYING ANYTHING MORE TILL THE PIGEON HAD FINISHED AS IF IT WASN'T TROUBLE ENOUGH HATCHING THE EGGS SAID THE PIGEON BUT I MUST BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR SERPENTS NIGHT AND DAY
BUT I DO KNOW THAT FOR THE NEXT LITTLE WHILE THE WHOLE WORLD SWAM AWAY FROM BEFORE ME IN A WHIRLING MIST SILVER AND THE BIRDS AND THE TALL SPY GLASS HILLTOP GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND TOPSY TURVY BEFORE MY EYES
HOWEVER I'VE GOT BACK TO MY RIGHT SIZE THE NEXT THING IS TO GET INTO THAT BEAUTIFUL GARDEN HOW IS THAT TO BE DONE I WONDER AS SHE SAID THIS SHE CAME SUDDENLY UPON AN OPEN PLACE WITH A LITTLE HOUSE IN IT ABOUT FOUR FEET HIGH
THE CATERPILLAR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK WHAT SIZE DO YOU WANT TO BE IT ASKED OH I'M NOT PARTICULAR AS TO SIZE ALICE HASTILY REPLIED ONLY ONE DOESN'T LIKE CHANGING SO OFTEN YOU KNOW
BUT NOW JOHN PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET BROUGHT OUT A WHISTLE AND BLEW UPON IT SEVERAL MODULATED BLASTS THAT RANG FAR ACROSS THE HEATED AIR I COULD NOT TELL OF COURSE THE MEANING OF THE SIGNAL
THE ROCKS OF THE SPY GLASS RE ECHOED IT A SCORE OF TIMES THE WHOLE TROOP OF MARSH BIRDS ROSE AGAIN DARKENING HEAVEN WITH A SIMULTANEOUS WHIRR AND LONG AFTER THAT DEATH YELL WAS STILL RINGING IN MY BRAIN
THAT THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM TO OPEN HER MOUTH BUT SHE DID IT AT LAST AND MANAGED TO SWALLOW A MORSEL OF THE LEFTHAND BIT COME MY HEAD'S FREE AT LAST SAID ALICE IN A TONE OF DELIGHT WHICH CHANGED INTO ALARM IN ANOTHER MOMENT
YET YOU FINISHED THE GOOSE WITH THE BONES AND THE BEAK PRAY HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO DO IT IN MY YOUTH SAID HIS FATHER I TOOK TO THE LAW AND ARGUED EACH CASE WITH MY WIFE AND THE MUSCULAR STRENGTH WHICH IT GAVE TO MY JAW HAS LASTED THE REST OF MY LIFE
WELL IF I SPEAK BACK PIKES WILL BE GOING IN TWO SHAKES IF I DON'T SILVER WILL SEE THERE'S SOMETHING UNDER THAT AND THE GAME'S UP NOW WE'VE ONLY ONE MAN TO RELY ON AND WHO IS THAT ASKED THE SQUIRE SILVER SIR RETURNED THE CAPTAIN
LEAPING BACK A YARD AS IT SEEMED TO ME WITH THE SPEED AND SECURITY OF A TRAINED GYMNAST HANDS OFF IF YOU LIKE JOHN SILVER SAID THE OTHER IT'S A BLACK CONSCIENCE THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEARED OF ME BUT IN HEAVEN'S NAME TELL ME WHAT WAS THAT
THE THICKET STRETCHED DOWN FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THE SANDY KNOLLS SPREADING AND GROWING TALLER AS IT WENT UNTIL IT REACHED THE MARGIN OF THE BROAD REEDY FEN THROUGH WHICH THE NEAREST OF THE LITTLE RIVERS SOAKED ITS WAY INTO THE ANCHORAGE
SO LONG AS IT LED ME FROM THE MURDERERS AND AS I RAN FEAR GREW AND GREW UPON ME UNTIL IT TURNED INTO A KIND OF FRENZY INDEED COULD ANYONE BE MORE ENTIRELY LOST THAN I
THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT THOUGHT ALICE TO HERSELF OF THE MUSHROOM SAID THE CATERPILLAR JUST AS IF SHE HAD ASKED IT ALOUD AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT ALICE REMAINED LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MUSHROOM FOR A MINUTE
I HARDLY KNOW SIR JUST AT PRESENT AT LEAST I KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I GOT UP THIS MORNING BUT I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT SAID THE CATERPILLAR STERNLY EXPLAIN YOURSELF
AND NOW WHICH IS WHICH SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND NIBBLED A LITTLE OF THE RIGHT HAND BIT TO TRY THE EFFECT THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FELT A VIOLENT BLOW UNDERNEATH HER CHIN IT HAD STRUCK HER FOOT
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE TO TURN INTO A CHRYSALIS YOU WILL SOME DAY YOU KNOW AND THEN AFTER THAT INTO A BUTTERFLY I SHOULD THINK YOU'LL FEEL IT A LITTLE QUEER WON'T YOU NOT A BIT SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL PERHAPS YOUR FEELINGS MAY BE DIFFERENT
NIBBLING FIRST AT ONE AND THEN AT THE OTHER AND GROWING SOMETIMES TALLER AND SOMETIMES SHORTER UNTIL SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING HERSELF DOWN TO HER USUAL HEIGHT IT WAS SO LONG SINCE SHE HAD BEEN ANYTHING NEAR THE RIGHT SIZE
COME BACK THE CATERPILLAR CALLED AFTER HER I'VE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS SOUNDED PROMISING CERTAINLY ALICE TURNED AND CAME BACK AGAIN KEEP YOUR TEMPER SAID THE CATERPILLAR
IF SIX MEN WERE LEFT BY SILVER IT WAS PLAIN OUR PARTY COULD NOT TAKE AND FIGHT THE SHIP AND SINCE ONLY SIX WERE LEFT IT WAS EQUALLY PLAIN THAT THE CABIN PARTY HAD NO PRESENT NEED OF MY ASSISTANCE IT OCCURRED TO ME AT ONCE TO GO ASHORE
NOT QUITE RIGHT I'M AFRAID SAID ALICE TIMIDLY SOME OF THE WORDS HAVE GOT ALTERED IT IS WRONG FROM BEGINNING TO END SAID THE CATERPILLAR DECIDEDLY AND THERE WAS SILENCE FOR SOME MINUTES
BUT I'LL STAKE MY WIG THERE'S FEVER HERE IF THE CONDUCT OF THE MEN HAD BEEN ALARMING IN THE BOAT IT BECAME TRULY THREATENING WHEN THEY HAD COME ABOARD THEY LAY ABOUT THE DECK GROWLING TOGETHER IN TALK
BUT HE WAS NOT DESTINED TO GO FAR WITH A CRY JOHN SEIZED THE BRANCH OF A TREE WHIPPED THE CRUTCH OUT OF HIS ARMPIT AND SENT THAT UNCOUTH MISSILE HURTLING THROUGH THE AIR IT STRUCK POOR TOM POINT FOREMOST
MINGLED WITH THESE WERE A FEW SCATTERED PINES SOME FIFTY SOME NEARER SEVENTY FEET HIGH THE AIR TOO SMELT MORE FRESHLY THAN DOWN BESIDE THE MARSH
APPEARED THE WORST WE HELD A COUNCIL IN THE CABIN SIR SAID THE CAPTAIN IF I RISK ANOTHER ORDER THE WHOLE SHIP'LL COME ABOUT OUR EARS BY THE RUN YOU SEE SIR HERE IT IS I GET A ROUGH ANSWER DO I NOT
FOR HER NECK KEPT GETTING ENTANGLED AMONG THE BRANCHES AND EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE HAD TO STOP AND UNTWIST IT AFTER A WHILE SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE STILL HELD THE PIECES OF MUSHROOM IN HER HANDS AND SHE SET TO WORK VERY CAREFULLY
AND ANOTHER OF THE CREW STOOD FACE TO FACE IN CONVERSATION THE SUN BEAT FULL UPON THEM SILVER HAD THROWN HIS HAT BESIDE HIM ON THE GROUND AND HIS GREAT SMOOTH BLOND FACE
HUNG OVER US LIKE A THUNDER CLOUD AND IT WAS NOT ONLY WE OF THE CABIN PARTY WHO PERCEIVED THE DANGER LONG JOHN WAS HARD AT WORK GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP SPENDING HIMSELF IN GOOD ADVICE AND AS FOR EXAMPLE NO MAN COULD HAVE SHOWN A BETTER
ALL'S UP YOU CAN'T MAKE NOR MEND IT'S TO SAVE YOUR NECK THAT I'M A SPEAKING AND IF ONE OF THE WILD UNS KNEW IT WHERE'D I BE TOM NOW TELL ME WHERE'D I BE SILVER SAID THE OTHER MAN
ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE OPEN STOOD ONE OF THE HILLS WITH TWO QUAINT CRAGGY PEAKS SHINING VIVIDLY IN THE SUN I NOW FELT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE JOY OF EXPLORATION THE ISLE WAS UNINHABITED
I CAN SEE YOU'RE TRYING TO INVENT SOMETHING I I'M A LITTLE GIRL SAID ALICE RATHER DOUBTFULLY AS SHE REMEMBERED THE NUMBER OF CHANGES SHE HAD GONE THROUGH THAT DAY A LIKELY STORY INDEED SAID THE PIGEON IN A TONE OF THE DEEPEST CONTEMPT
I HAVE ANSWERED THREE QUESTIONS AND THAT IS ENOUGH SAID HIS FATHER DON'T GIVE YOURSELF AIRS DO YOU THINK I CAN LISTEN ALL DAY TO SUCH STUFF BE OFF OR I'LL KICK YOU DOWN STAIRS THAT IS NOT SAID RIGHT SAID THE CATERPILLAR
BUT SILVER FROM THE OTHER BOAT LOOKED SHARPLY OVER AND CALLED OUT TO KNOW IF THAT WERE ME AND FROM THAT MOMENT I BEGAN TO REGRET WHAT I HAD DONE THE CREWS RACED FOR THE BEACH BUT THE BOAT I WAS IN HAVING SOME START AND BEING AT ONCE THE LIGHTER AND THE BETTER MANNED
YOU ARE OLD SAID THE YOUTH ONE WOULD HARDLY SUPPOSE THAT YOUR EYE WAS AS STEADY AS EVER YET YOU BALANCED AN EEL ON THE END OF YOUR NOSE WHAT MADE YOU SO AWFULLY CLEVER
WHY I HAVEN'T HAD A WINK OF SLEEP THESE THREE WEEKS I'M VERY SORRY YOU'VE BEEN ANNOYED SAID ALICE WHO WAS BEGINNING TO SEE ITS MEANING AND JUST AS I'D TAKEN THE HIGHEST TREE IN THE WOOD CONTINUED THE PIGEON RAISING ITS VOICE TO A SHRIEK
I CAN'T EXPLAIN MYSELF I'M AFRAID SIR SAID ALICE BECAUSE I'M NOT MYSELF YOU SEE I DON'T SEE SAID THE CATERPILLAR I'M AFRAID I CAN'T PUT IT MORE CLEARLY ALICE REPLIED VERY POLITELY
I HAVEN'T THE LEAST IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SAID ALICE I'VE TRIED THE ROOTS OF TREES AND I'VE TRIED BANKS AND I'VE TRIED HEDGES THE PIGEON WENT ON WITHOUT ATTENDING TO HER BUT THOSE SERPENTS THERE'S NO PLEASING THEM
THEN IT GOT DOWN OFF THE MUSHROOM AND CRAWLED AWAY IN THE GRASS MERELY REMARKING AS IT WENT ONE SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW TALLER AND THE OTHER SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW SHORTER ONE SIDE OF WHAT
I'M AFRAID I AM SIR SAID ALICE I CAN'T REMEMBER THINGS AS I USED AND I DON'T KEEP THE SAME SIZE FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THINGS SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL
WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO BE A LITTLE LARGER SIR IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND SAID ALICE THREE INCHES IS SUCH A WRETCHED HEIGHT TO BE IT IS A VERY GOOD HEIGHT INDEED SAID THE CATERPILLAR ANGRILY REARING ITSELF UPRIGHT AS IT SPOKE
PART THREE MY SHORE ADVENTURE
IT WAS EXACTLY THREE INCHES HIGH BUT I'M NOT USED TO IT PLEADED POOR ALICE IN A PITEOUS TONE AND SHE THOUGHT OF HERSELF I WISH THE CREATURES WOULDN'T BE SO EASILY OFFENDED YOU'LL GET USED TO IT IN TIME SAID THE CATERPILLAR
LIKE ENOUGH TO JUDGE FROM THE SOUND HIS BACK WAS BROKEN ON THE SPOT BUT HE HAD NO TIME GIVEN HIM TO RECOVER SILVER AGILE AS A MONKEY EVEN WITHOUT LEG OR CRUTCH WAS ON THE TOP OF HIM NEXT MOMENT
WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FIRST THAT HAD EVER ANCHORED THERE SINCE THE ISLAND AROSE OUT OF THE SEAS THERE WAS NOT A BREATH OF AIR MOVING NOR A SOUND BUT THAT OF THE SURF BOOMING HALF A MILE AWAY ALONG THE BEACHES AND AGAINST THE ROCKS OUTSIDE
IF THEY NONE OF THEM GO WELL THEN WE HOLD THE CABIN AND GOD DEFEND THE RIGHT IF SOME GO YOU MARK MY WORDS SIR SILVER'LL BRING EM ABOARD AGAIN AS MILD AS LAMBS IT WAS SO DECIDED
MY LADS SAID HE WE'VE HAD A HOT DAY AND ARE ALL TIRED AND OUT OF SORTS A TURN ASHORE'LL HURT NOBODY THE BOATS ARE STILL IN THE WATER YOU CAN TAKE THE GIGS AND AS MANY AS PLEASE MAY GO ASHORE FOR THE AFTERNOON
WAS A THING I NEVER LEARNED TO STAND WITHOUT A QUALM OR SO ABOVE ALL IN THE MORNING ON AN EMPTY STOMACH PERHAPS IT WAS THIS PERHAPS IT WAS THE LOOK OF THE ISLAND WITH ITS GREY MELANCHOLY WOODS AND WILD STONE SPIRES
AND A FEW BEING GOOD FELLOWS IN THE MAIN COULD NEITHER BE LED NOR DRIVEN ANY FURTHER IT IS ONE THING TO BE IDLE AND SKULK AND QUITE ANOTHER TO TAKE A SHIP AND MURDER A NUMBER OF INNOCENT MEN AT LAST HOWEVER THE PARTY WAS MADE UP
HERE AT THAT SAME MOMENT CAME NEWS OF ANOTHER FAR AWAY OUT IN THE MARSH THERE AROSE ALL OF A SUDDEN A SOUND LIKE THE CRY OF ANGER THEN ANOTHER ON THE BACK OF IT AND THEN ONE HORRID LONG DRAWN SCREAM
HAD HE BEEN ON DECK HE COULD NO LONGER SO MUCH AS HAVE PRETENDED NOT TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION IT WAS AS PLAIN AS DAY
AND IT PUT THE HOOKAH INTO ITS MOUTH AND BEGAN SMOKING AGAIN THIS TIME ALICE WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL IT CHOSE TO SPEAK AGAIN IN A MINUTE OR TWO THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH AND YAWNED ONCE OR TWICE AND SHOOK ITSELF
AND AT THIS POINT TOM FLASHED OUT LIKE A HERO ALAN HE CRIED THEN REST HIS SOUL FOR A TRUE SEAMAN AND AS FOR YOU JOHN SILVER LONG YOU'VE BEEN A MATE OF MINE BUT YOU'RE MATE OF MINE NO MORE
IN MY YOUTH SAID THE SAGE AS HE SHOOK HIS GREY LOCKS I KEPT ALL MY LIMBS VERY SUPPLE BY THE USE OF THIS OINTMENT ONE SHILLING THE BOX ALLOW ME TO SELL YOU A COUPLE YOU ARE OLD SAID THE YOUTH AND YOUR JAWS ARE TOO WEAK FOR ANYTHING TOUGHER THAN SUET
HE KNEW THE PASSAGE LIKE THE PALM OF HIS HAND AND THOUGH THE MAN IN THE CHAINS GOT EVERYWHERE MORE WATER THAN WAS DOWN IN THE CHART JOHN NEVER HESITATED ONCE THERE'S A STRONG SCOUR WITH THE EBB HE SAID
I COULD HEAR HAILS COMING AND GOING BETWEEN THE OLD BUCCANEER AND HIS COMRADES AND THIS SOUND OF DANGER LENT ME WINGS AS SOON AS I WAS CLEAR OF THE THICKET I RAN AS I NEVER RAN BEFORE SCARCE MINDING THE DIRECTION OF MY FLIGHT
GOOD BYE TO THE SQUIRE THE DOCTOR AND THE CAPTAIN THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR ME BUT DEATH BY STARVATION OR DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THE MUTINEERS ALL THIS WHILE AS I SAY I WAS STILL RUNNING
TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHICH WERE THE TWO SIDES OF IT AND AS IT WAS PERFECTLY ROUND SHE FOUND THIS A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION HOWEVER AT LAST SHE STRETCHED HER ARMS ROUND IT AS FAR AS THEY WOULD GO AND BROKE OFF A BIT OF THE EDGE WITH EACH HAND
SHOT FAR AHEAD OF HER CONSORT AND THE BOW HAD STRUCK AMONG THE SHORE SIDE TREES AND I HAD CAUGHT A BRANCH AND SWUNG MYSELF OUT AND PLUNGED INTO THE NEAREST THICKET WHILE SILVER AND THE REST WERE STILL A HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND
IN A JIFFY I HAD SLIPPED OVER THE SIDE AND CURLED UP IN THE FORE SHEETS OF THE NEAREST BOAT AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT SHE SHOVED OFF NO ONE TOOK NOTICE OF ME ONLY THE BOW OAR SAYING IS THAT YOU JIM KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN
HERE AND THERE I SAW SNAKES AND ONE RAISED HIS HEAD FROM A LEDGE OF ROCK AND HISSED AT ME WITH A NOISE NOT UNLIKE THE SPINNING OF A TOP LITTLE DID I SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS A DEADLY ENEMY AND THAT THE NOISE WAS THE FAMOUS RATTLE
THE BOOMS WERE TEARING AT THE BLOCKS THE RUDDER WAS BANGING TO AND FRO AND THE WHOLE SHIP CREAKING GROANING AND JUMPING LIKE A MANUFACTORY
WOULD NOT MY ABSENCE ITSELF BE AN EVIDENCE TO THEM OF MY ALARM AND THEREFORE OF MY FATAL KNOWLEDGE IT WAS ALL OVER I THOUGHT
FOR I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF TO BEGIN WITH AND BEING SO MANY DIFFERENT SIZES IN A DAY IS VERY CONFUSING IT ISN'T SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT SO YET SAID ALICE
THE SUN STILL SHINING MERCILESSLY ON THE STEAMING MARSH AND THE TALL PINNACLE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND I COULD SCARCE PERSUADE MYSELF THAT MURDER HAD BEEN ACTUALLY DONE AND A HUMAN LIFE CRUELLY CUT SHORT A MOMENT SINCE BEFORE MY EYES
FOR SOON I HEARD THE VERY DISTANT AND LOW TONES OF A HUMAN VOICE WHICH AS I CONTINUED TO GIVE EAR GREW STEADILY LOUDER AND NEARER THIS PUT ME IN A GREAT FEAR AND I CRAWLED UNDER COVER OF THE NEAREST LIVE OAK AND SQUATTED THERE
THE PLUNGE OF OUR ANCHOR SENT UP CLOUDS OF BIRDS WHEELING AND CRYING OVER THE WOODS BUT IN LESS THAN A MINUTE THEY WERE DOWN AGAIN AND ALL WAS ONCE MORE SILENT THE PLACE WAS ENTIRELY LAND LOCKED BURIED IN WOODS
THE HILLS RAN UP CLEAR ABOVE THE VEGETATION IN SPIRES OF NAKED ROCK ALL WERE STRANGELY SHAPED AND THE SPY GLASS WHICH WAS BY THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED FEET THE TALLEST ON THE ISLAND WAS LIKEWISE THE STRANGEST IN CONFIGURATION
AND YOU'VE MONEY TOO WHICH LOTS OF POOR SAILORS HASN'T AND YOU'RE BRAVE OR I'M MISTOOK
THAT IT FELT QUITE STRANGE AT FIRST BUT SHE GOT USED TO IT IN A FEW MINUTES AND BEGAN TALKING TO HERSELF AS USUAL COME THERE'S HALF MY PLAN DONE NOW HOW PUZZLING ALL THESE CHANGES ARE I'M NEVER SURE WHAT I'M GOING TO BE FROM ONE MINUTE TO ANOTHER
CHAPTER FIVE ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR THE CATERPILLAR AND ALICE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE AT LAST THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH
THAT SINCE I HAD BEEN SO FOOLHARDY AS TO COME ASHORE WITH THESE DESPERADOES THE LEAST I COULD DO WAS TO OVERHEAR THEM AT THEIR COUNCILS AND THAT MY PLAIN AND OBVIOUS DUTY WAS TO DRAW AS CLOSE AS I COULD MANAGE UNDER THE FAVOURABLE AMBUSH OF THE CROUCHING TREES
HIS EYE A MERE PIN POINT IN HIS BIG FACE BUT GLEAMING LIKE A CRUMB OF GLASS THAT
SIX FELLOWS WERE TO STAY ON BOARD AND THE REMAINING THIRTEEN INCLUDING SILVER BEGAN TO EMBARK THEN IT WAS THAT THERE CAME INTO MY HEAD THE FIRST OF THE MAD NOTIONS THAT CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH TO SAVE OUR LIVES
SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL FRIGHTENED BY THIS VERY SUDDEN CHANGE BUT SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST AS SHE WAS SHRINKING RAPIDLY SO SHE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO EAT SOME OF THE OTHER BIT HER CHIN WAS PRESSED SO CLOSELY AGAINST HER FOOT
A PECULIAR STAGNANT SMELL HUNG OVER THE ANCHORAGE A SMELL OF SODDEN LEAVES AND ROTTING TREE TRUNKS I OBSERVED THE DOCTOR SNIFFING AND SNIFFING LIKE SOMEONE TASTING A BAD EGG I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TREASURE HE SAID
LOADED PISTOLS WERE SERVED OUT TO ALL THE SURE MEN HUNTER JOYCE AND REDRUTH WERE TAKEN INTO OUR CONFIDENCE AND RECEIVED THE NEWS WITH LESS SURPRISE AND A BETTER SPIRIT THAN WE HAD LOOKED FOR AND THEN THE CAPTAIN WENT ON DECK AND ADDRESSED THE CREW
ANOTHER FOLLOWED AND SOON OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE MARSH A GREAT CLOUD OF BIRDS HUNG SCREAMING AND CIRCLING IN THE AIR I JUDGED AT ONCE THAT SOME OF MY SHIPMATES MUST BE DRAWING NEAR ALONG THE BORDERS OF THE FEN NOR WAS I DECEIVED
AND ADDRESSED HER IN A LANGUID SLEEPY VOICE WHO ARE YOU SAID THE CATERPILLAR THIS WAS NOT AN ENCOURAGING OPENING FOR A CONVERSATION ALICE REPLIED RATHER SHYLY I
AND JUST AS I WAS THINKING I SHOULD BE FREE OF THEM AT LAST THEY MUST NEEDS COME WRIGGLING DOWN FROM THE SKY UGH SERPENT BUT I'M NOT A SERPENT I TELL YOU SAID ALICE I'M A I'M A WELL WHAT ARE YOU SAID THE PIGEON
I DON'T KNOW SAID THE CATERPILLAR ALICE SAID NOTHING SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO MUCH CONTRADICTED IN HER LIFE BEFORE AND SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS LOSING HER TEMPER
I'VE TRIED TO SAY HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE BUT IT ALL CAME DIFFERENT ALICE REPLIED IN A VERY MELANCHOLY VOICE REPEAT YOU ARE OLD FATHER WILLIAM SAID THE CATERPILLAR ALICE FOLDED HER HANDS AND BEGAN
IF I DIE LIKE A DOG I'LL DIE IN MY DOOTY YOU'VE KILLED ALAN HAVE YOU KILL ME TOO IF YOU CAN BUT I DEFIES YOU AND WITH THAT THIS BRAVE FELLOW TURNED HIS BACK DIRECTLY ON THE COOK AND SET OFF WALKING FOR THE BEACH
AND THE BOATS HAD TO BE GOT OUT AND MANNED AND THE SHIP WARPED THREE OR FOUR MILES ROUND THE CORNER OF THE ISLAND AND UP THE NARROW PASSAGE TO THE HAVEN BEHIND SKELETON ISLAND I VOLUNTEERED FOR ONE OF THE BOATS WHERE I HAD OF COURSE NO BUSINESS
WHY SAID THE CATERPILLAR HERE WAS ANOTHER PUZZLING QUESTION AND AS ALICE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY GOOD REASON AND AS THE CATERPILLAR SEEMED TO BE IN A VERY UNPLEASANT STATE OF MIND SHE TURNED AWAY
THE SLIGHTEST ORDER WAS RECEIVED WITH A BLACK LOOK AND GRUDGINGLY AND CARELESSLY OBEYED EVEN THE HONEST HANDS MUST HAVE CAUGHT THE INFECTION FOR THERE WAS NOT ONE MAN ABOARD TO MEND ANOTHER MUTINY IT WAS PLAIN
ONLY NOW AND AGAIN INTERRUPTED BY THE OTHER BY THE SOUND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TALKING EARNESTLY AND ALMOST FIERCELY BUT NO DISTINCT WORD CAME TO MY HEARING AT LAST THE SPEAKERS SEEMED TO HAVE PAUSED AND PERHAPS TO HAVE SAT DOWN
JUST BEFORE HIM TOM LAY MOTIONLESS UPON THE SWARD BUT THE MURDERER MINDED HIM NOT A WHIT CLEANSING HIS BLOOD STAINED KNIFE THE WHILE UPON A WISP OF GRASS EVERYTHING ELSE WAS UNCHANGED
WHEN THE GUN FIRED HOW SHOULD I DARE TO GO DOWN TO THE BOATS AMONG THOSE FIENDS STILL SMOKING FROM THEIR CRIME WOULD NOT THE FIRST OF THEM WHO SAW ME WRING MY NECK LIKE A SNIPE'S
WHICH BROUGHT THEM BACK AGAIN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION ALICE FELT A LITTLE IRRITATED AT THE CATERPILLAR'S MAKING SUCH VERY SHORT REMARKS AND SHE DREW HERSELF UP AND SAID VERY GRAVELY I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME WHO YOU ARE FIRST
HOW MY SHORE ADVENTURE BEGAN THE APPEARANCE OF THE ISLAND WHEN I CAME ON DECK NEXT MORNING WAS ALTOGETHER CHANGED ALTHOUGH THE BREEZE HAD NOW UTTERLY CEASED
AND THE SURF THAT WE COULD BOTH SEE AND HEAR FOAMING AND THUNDERING ON THE STEEP BEACH AT LEAST ALTHOUGH THE SUN SHONE BRIGHT AND HOT AND THE SHORE BIRDS WERE FISHING AND CRYING ALL AROUND US
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A VERY BAD SIGN FOR UP TO THAT DAY THE MEN HAD GONE BRISKLY AND WILLINGLY ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS BUT THE VERY SIGHT OF THE ISLAND HAD RELAXED THE CORDS OF DISCIPLINE ALL THE WAY IN LONG JOHN STOOD BY THE STEERSMAN AND CONNED THE SHIP
THE HEAT WAS SWELTERING AND THE MEN GRUMBLED FIERCELY OVER THEIR WORK ANDERSON WAS IN COMMAND OF MY BOAT AND INSTEAD OF KEEPING THE CREW IN ORDER HE GRUMBLED AS LOUD AS THE WORST WELL HE SAID WITH AN OATH IT'S NOT FOREVER
SILENCE HAD RE ESTABLISHED ITS EMPIRE AND ONLY THE RUSTLE OF THE REDESCENDING BIRDS AND THE BOOM OF THE DISTANT SURGES DISTURBED THE LANGUOR OF THE AFTERNOON TOM HAD LEAPED AT THE SOUND LIKE A HORSE AT THE SPUR
SAID ALICE ALL I KNOW IS IT WOULD FEEL VERY QUEER TO ME YOU SAID THE CATERPILLAR CONTEMPTUOUSLY
NOT YOU AS SURE AS GOD SEES ME I'D SOONER LOSE MY HAND IF I TURN AGIN MY DOOTY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A NOISE I HAD FOUND ONE OF THE HONEST HANDS WELL
ALL SHINING WITH HEAT WAS LIFTED TO THE OTHER MAN'S IN A KIND OF APPEAL MATE HE WAS SAYING IT'S BECAUSE I THINKS GOLD DUST OF YOU GOLD DUST AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT IF I HADN'T TOOK TO YOU LIKE PITCH
AND WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE I HAD DRAWN NEAR TO THE FOOT OF THE LITTLE HILL WITH THE TWO PEAKS AND HAD GOT INTO A PART OF THE ISLAND WHERE THE LIVE OAKS GREW MORE WIDELY APART AND SEEMED MORE LIKE FOREST TREES IN THEIR BEARING AND DIMENSIONS
THIS EVEN TINT WAS INDEED BROKEN UP BY STREAKS OF YELLOW SAND BREAK IN THE LOWER LANDS AND BY MANY TALL TREES OF THE PINE FAMILY OUT TOPPING THE OTHERS SOME SINGLY SOME IN CLUMPS BUT THE GENERAL COLOURING WAS UNIFORM AND SAD
WHICH SHE FOUND TO BE NOTHING BUT THE TOPS OF THE TREES UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN WANDERING WHEN A SHARP HISS MADE HER DRAW BACK IN A HURRY A LARGE PIGEON HAD FLOWN INTO HER FACE AND WAS BEATING HER VIOLENTLY WITH ITS WINGS SERPENT SCREAMED THE PIGEON
AND WITH STUNNING VIOLENCE RIGHT BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK HIS HANDS FLEW UP HE GAVE A SORT OF GASP AND FELL WHETHER HE WERE INJURED MUCH OR LITTLE NONE COULD EVER TELL
I MADE STEADILY BUT SLOWLY TOWARDS THEM TILL AT LAST RAISING MY HEAD TO AN APERTURE AMONG THE LEAVES I COULD SEE CLEAR DOWN INTO A LITTLE GREEN DELL BESIDE THE MARSH AND CLOSELY SET ABOUT WITH TREES WHERE LONG JOHN SILVER
AND WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT HER NECK WOULD BEND ABOUT EASILY IN ANY DIRECTION LIKE A SERPENT SHE HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN CURVING IT DOWN INTO A GRACEFUL ZIGZAG AND WAS GOING TO DIVE IN AMONG THE LEAVES
THE HONEST HANDS AND I WAS SOON TO SEE IT PROVED THAT THERE WERE SUCH ON BOARD MUST HAVE BEEN VERY STUPID FELLOWS OR RATHER I SUPPOSE THE TRUTH WAS THIS THAT ALL HANDS WERE DISAFFECTED BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE RINGLEADERS ONLY SOME MORE SOME LESS
HE FAIRLY OUTSTRIPPED HIMSELF IN WILLINGNESS AND CIVILITY HE WAS ALL SMILES TO EVERYONE IF AN ORDER WERE GIVEN
HEARKENING AS SILENT AS A MOUSE ANOTHER VOICE ANSWERED AND THEN THE FIRST VOICE WHICH I NOW RECOGNIZED TO BE SILVER'S ONCE MORE TOOK UP THE STORY AND RAN ON FOR A LONG WHILE IN A STREAM
I'M NOT A SERPENT SAID ALICE INDIGNANTLY LET ME ALONE SERPENT I SAY AGAIN REPEATED THE PIGEON BUT IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE AND ADDED WITH A KIND OF SOB I'VE TRIED EVERY WAY AND NOTHING SEEMS TO SUIT THEM
BUT YOU MAY SUPPOSE I PAID NO HEED
HUNTER WAS STEADY THAT WE KNEW JOYCE WAS A DOUBTFUL CASE A PLEASANT POLITE MAN FOR A VALET
AND THE DUCK SEEMED MUCH TIRED AND WADDLED ABOUT A GOOD DEAL FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
AS STANDING IN THE TIN POT SPOILS THE FLAVOR PUT TWO TEA SPOONSFUL OF GROUND COFFEE IN A SMALL MUG AND POUR BOILING WATER ON IT LET IT SET BY THE FIRE TO SETTLE AND POUR IT OFF IN A CUP WITH SUGAR AND CREAM
IF THE ROOM IS KEPT PERFECTLY STILL BOILED CUSTARD BEAT AN EGG WITH A HEAPED TEA SPOONFUL OF SUGAR STIR IT INTO A TEA CUPFUL OF BOILING MILK AND STIR TILL IT IS THICK
WAS IN CONSEQUENCE THE MOST EXPOSED HOWEVER WE HAD NO LUCK FOR JUST AS TRELAWNEY FIRED DOWN HE STOOPED THE BALL WHISTLED OVER HIM
IF YOU HAVE A SMALL CHICKEN IT WILL TAKE HALF OF IT TO MAKE A PINT OF CHICKEN WATER
AND PUT IN A SPOONFUL OF BUTTER TOAST A SLICE OF BREAD AND MOISTEN IT WITH WATER THEN POUR ON THE BOILING MILK THIS IS VERY GOOD FOR SICK PERSONS AND CAN BE EATEN WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE OTHER FOUR WHO FELL THE CRY HE GAVE WAS ECHOED NOT ONLY BY HIS COMPANIONS ON BOARD BUT BY A GREAT NUMBER OF VOICES FROM THE SHORE
HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF
ALL ON A SUDDEN AS SHE WAS GOING OUT IN CAME THE KING'S SON IN GOLDEN CLOTHES
AND IF NICELY WARMED OVER IS AS GOOD AS WHEN FRESH CORN GRUEL
AND POUR IT OUT ON A SLICE OF BREAD TOASTED AND CUT UP OR SOME DRIED RUSK IF THE PATIENT SHOULD LIKE THEM YOU CAN PUT IN A FEW RAISINS STONED AND CUT UP
AND TO BRUSH ONE'S CLOTHES BUT NOT ENTIRELY FITTED FOR A MAN OF WAR WITH ALL THIS IN OUR MINDS WE WADED ASHORE AS FAST AS WE COULD LEAVING BEHIND US
BUT ON THE STEPS KING GRISLY BEARD OVERTOOK HER AND BROUGHT HER BACK AND SAID
PAT A TEA SPOONFUL IN A POT THAT WILL HOLD ABOUT TWO CUPS AND POUR BOILING WATER ON IT LET IT SET BY THE FIRE TO DRAW FIVE OR TEN MINUTES RYE MUSH THIS IS A NOURISHING AND LIGHT DIET FOR THE SICK
BUT THE BRIDE SAID RUN FIRST AND BRING ME MY GARLAND THAT IS HANGING ON A WILLOW IN THE GARDEN
AH UNLUCKY WRETCH THAT I AM SIGHED SHE WOULD THAT I HAD MARRIED KING GRISLY BEARD NEXT THEY CAME TO SOME FINE MEADOWS WHOSE ARE THESE BEAUTIFUL GREEN MEADOWS SAID SHE
AND THIS TIME HE GOT SAFELY TO THE OTHER SIDE WITH THE HEARSE
CHANTICLEER RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD TO THE RIVER AND SAID RIVER GIVE ME SOME WATER FOR PARTLET LIES IN THE MOUNTAIN
BELOW THE CLUSTERING TREES THE GIG WAS NO LONGER TO BE FEARED THE LITTLE POINT HAD ALREADY CONCEALED IT FROM OUR EYES THE EBB TIDE WHICH HAD SO CRUELLY DELAYED US
ALAS SIGHED SHE
SO SHE RAN HOME AND TOLD HIM ALL
WHEN YOU SEE THE MATCH AND WE'LL HOLD WATER IN THE MEANWHILE WE HAD BEEN MAKING HEADWAY AT A GOOD PACE FOR A BOAT SO OVERLOADED AND WE HAD SHIPPED
AND BROKE ALL HER GOODS INTO A THOUSAND PIECES THEN SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO AH WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME SAID SHE WHAT WILL MY HUSBAND SAY
CRYING NOW DUCK GET ON AS FAST AS YOU CAN AND AWAY THEY WENT AT A PRETTY GOOD PACE AFTER THEY HAD TRAVELLED ALONG A LITTLE WAY
AND THE NEEDLE CRIED OUT STOP STOP
SO WORDS AND TEARS WERE OF NO AVAIL THE PARSON WAS SENT FOR AND SHE WAS MARRIED TO THE FIDDLER WHEN THIS WAS OVER THE KING SAID NOW GET READY TO GO YOU MUST NOT STAY HERE
SO THAT THE MEATS IN IT FELL ABOUT THEN EVERYBODY LAUGHED AND JEERED AT HER AND SHE WAS SO ABASHED THAT SHE WISHED HERSELF A THOUSAND FEET DEEP IN THE EARTH SHE SPRANG TO THE DOOR TO RUN AWAY
ANOTHER DAY
THEN SAID A STRAW I WILL LAY MYSELF ACROSS
AND OFFERED A TARGET LIKE A BARN DOOR I COULD HEAR AS WELL AS SEE THAT BRANDY FACED RASCAL ISRAEL
TAMARINDS CURRANT OR GRAPE JELLY CRANBERRIES OR DRIED FRUIT OF ANY KIND MAKE A GOOD DRINK COFFEE SICK PERSONS SHOULD HAVE THEIR COFFEE MADE SEPARATE FROM THE FAMILY
CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN THAT THERE ARE NO BURNT GRAINS CHOCOLATE TO MAKE A CUP OF CHOCOLATE GRATE A LARGE TEA SPOONFUL IN A MUG
AND WE GOT HER TO LIE A LITTLE MORE EVENLY ALL THE SAME WE WERE AFRAID TO BREATHE IN THE SECOND PLACE THE EBB WAS NOW MAKING A STRONG RIPPLING CURRENT
AND SIX MICE BUILT A LITTLE HEARSE TO CARRY HER TO HER GRAVE AND WHEN IT WAS READY THEY HARNESSED THEMSELVES BEFORE IT AND CHANTICLEER DROVE THEM ON THE WAY THEY MET THE FOX
WINE WHEY
HAD BEEN AT A PUBLIC HOUSE A FEW MILES OFF AND HAD SAT DRINKING TILL THEY HAD FORGOTTEN HOW LATE IT WAS HE BEGGED THEREFORE THAT THE TRAVELLERS WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO GIVE THEM A LIFT IN THEIR CARRIAGE
BEFORE THE SQUIRREL TAKES THEM ALL AWAY WITH ALL MY HEART SAID PARTLET LET US GO AND MAKE A HOLIDAY OF IT TOGETHER SO THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS AND AS IT WAS A LOVELY DAY THEY STAYED THERE TILL THE EVENING
AND STIR IN WHEN IT BOILS KEEP STIRRING IT FIVE MINUTES WHEN POUR IT IN A BOWL AND SEASON WITH SALT BARLEY WATER
WHEN IT TURNS TAKE OUT THE RENNET
YOU HAVE SUNG SO WELL THAT I WILL GIVE YOU MY DAUGHTER FOR YOUR WIFE
AND ASKED THITHER ALL HER SUITORS AND THEY ALL SAT IN A ROW RANGED ACCORDING TO THEIR RANK KINGS AND PRINCES AND DUKES AND EARLS AND COUNTS AND BARONS AND KNIGHTS
I'LL TRY AND SET UP A TRADE IN POTS AND PANS
LET IT SOAK A FEW MINUTES TO EXTRACT THE SALT AND STEW IT IN A LITTLE WATER JUST BEFORE IT IS DONE PUT IN SOME CREAM AND PARSLEY IF YOU BROIL HAM THAT IS UNCOOKED IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE SOAKED IN WATER A FEW MINUTES
MOISTEN TWO TEA SPOONSFUL OF POWDERED ARROW ROOT WITH WATER AND RUB IT SMOOTH WITH A SPOON THEN POUR ON HALF A PINT OF BOILING WATER SEASON IT WITH LEMON JUICE OR WINE AND NUTMEG IN COOKING ARROW ROOT FOR CHILDREN
SAID SHE THE NEXT WAS TOO TALL WHAT A MAYPOLE SAID SHE THE NEXT WAS TOO SHORT WHAT A DUMPLING SAID SHE THE FOURTH WAS TOO PALE
WHAT A PALTRY PLACE SAID SHE TO WHOM DOES THAT LITTLE DIRTY HOLE BELONG THEN THE FIDDLER SAID THAT IS YOUR AND MY HOUSE WHERE WE ARE TO LIVE
AND WHEN NOBODY WAS STIRRING IN THE INN CHANTICLEER AWAKENED HIS WIFE AND FETCHING THE EGG THEY PECKED A HOLE IN IT ATE IT UP AND THREW THE SHELLS INTO THE FIREPLACE
SEASON TO YOUR TASTE WITH WINE NUTMEG AND BUTTER OAT MEAL GRUEL
RUNNING WESTWARD THROUGH THE BASIN AND THEN SOUTH'ARD AND SEAWARD DOWN THE STRAITS BY WHICH WE HAD ENTERED IN THE MORNING EVEN THE RIPPLES WERE A DANGER TO OUR OVERLOADED CRAFT
PARTLET AND HAVING DUG A GRAVE FOR HER HE LAID HER IN IT AND MADE A LITTLE HILLOCK OVER HER THEN HE SAT DOWN BY THE GRAVE AND WEPT AND MOURNED TILL AT LAST HE DIED TOO
NOT HAVING REACHED HIM WHERE THE BALL PASSED NOT ONE OF US PRECISELY KNEW BUT I FANCY IT MUST HAVE BEEN OVER OUR HEADS AND THAT THE WIND OF IT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR DISASTER
I AM THE FIDDLER WHO HAS LIVED WITH YOU IN THE HUT I BROUGHT YOU THERE BECAUSE I REALLY LOVED YOU I AM ALSO THE SOLDIER THAT OVERSET YOUR STALL
PUT A PINT OF WATER IN A CLEAN SKILLET WITH A LITTLE BUTTER AND SALT WHEN IT BOILS BREAK TWO EGGS IN A PLATE AND PUT THEM IN
MIXED SMOOTH IN A LITTLE WATER AND STIRRED IN A PINT OF BOILING WATER LET IT BOIL TWENTY MINUTES STIRRING FREQUENTLY
WHEN IT HAS BOILED DOWN TO A PINT TAKE IT UP AND PUT IN A LITTLE SALT AND SLICE OF TOASTED BREAD THIS IS VALUABLE IN CASES OF DYSENTERY AND CHOLERA MORBUS PARTICULARLY WHEN MADE OF OLD FOWLS
SEVERAL TIMES WE SHIPPED A LITTLE WATER AND MY BREECHES AND THE TAILS OF MY COAT WERE ALL SOAKING WET BEFORE WE HAD GONE A HUNDRED YARDS THE CAPTAIN MADE US TRIM THE BOAT
AND SEASON IT WITH WINE OR LEMON JUICE TAPIOCA JELLY WASH THE TAPIOCA WELL AND LET IT SOAK FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN COLD WATER PUT IT IN A SAUCE PAN WITH THE SAME WATER AND LET IT BOIL SLOWLY TILL IT IS CLEAR AND THICK
AS FOR THE CAPTAIN HE HAD CARRIED HIS OVER HIS SHOULDER BY A BANDOLEER AND LIKE A WISE MAN LOCK UPPERMOST THE OTHER THREE HAD GONE DOWN WITH THE BOAT
BUT IT WAS PLAIN THAT THEY MEANT NOTHING SHOULD DELAY THEIR SHOT THEY HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS LOOKED AT THEIR FALLEN COMRADE THOUGH HE WAS NOT DEAD
AND CHANTICLEER REPLIED ALL ON OUR WAY A VISIT TO PAY TO MISTER KORBES THE FOX TODAY THEN THE CAT SAID TAKE ME WITH YOU CHANTICLEER SAID
TWO FRESH MEN WERE AT THE OARS THE TIDE KEEPS WASHING HER DOWN COULD YOU PULL A LITTLE STRONGER NOT WITHOUT SWAMPING THE BOAT SAID HE YOU MUST BEAR UP SIR
YOU HAVE LEARNT WISDOM AND IT IS TIME TO HOLD OUR MARRIAGE FEAST THEN THE CHAMBERLAINS CAME AND BROUGHT HER THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ROBES AND HER FATHER AND HIS WHOLE COURT WERE THERE ALREADY
HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS THE NUTS ARE QUITE RIPE NOW SAID CHANTICLEER TO HIS WIFE PARTLET SUPPOSE WE GO TOGETHER TO THE MOUNTAINS AND EAT AS MANY AS WE CAN
PUT IT IN A SAUCE PAN WITH A QUART OF NEW MILK
OR JUST ABOUT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE WAY WE OUGHT TO GO WE'LL NEVER GET ASHORE AT THIS RATE SAID I IF IT'S THE ONLY COURSE THAT WE CAN LIE SIR WE MUST EVEN LIE IT
LET IT BOIL TEN MINUTES AND STRAIN IT
THEY HAD ALL BEEN THINE AH UNLUCKY WRETCH THAT I AM SAID SHE WOULD THAT I HAD MARRIED KING GRISLY BEARD THEN THEY CAME TO A GREAT CITY
FOOD FOR THE SICK REMARKS ON PREPARING FOOD FOR THE SICK FEW YOUNG PERSONS UNDERSTAND COOKING FOR THE SICK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW TO PREPARE THEIR FOOD IN AN INVITING MANNER
CALF'S FOOT BLANCMANGE PUT A SET OF NICELY CLEANED FEET IN FOUR QUARTS OF WATER AND LET IT BOIL MORE THAN HALF AWAY STRAIN THROUGH A COLANDER AND WHEN IT IS COLD SCRAPE OFF ALL THE FAT
SO CHANTICLEER BUILT A HANDSOME CARRIAGE WITH FOUR RED WHEELS AND HARNESSED SIX MICE TO IT AND THEN HE AND PARTLET GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE AND AWAY THEY DROVE SOON AFTERWARDS A CAT MET THEM AND SAID WHERE ARE YOU GOING
THEN WARM IT AND PUT IN A LITTLE SALT
THE LITTLE GALLIPOT OF A BOAT THAT WE WERE IN WAS GRAVELY OVERLOADED FIVE GROWN MEN AND THREE OF THEM TRELAWNEY REDRUTH AND THE CAPTAIN OVER SIX FEET HIGH
WHILE THIS WAS PASSING A DUCK CAME QUACKING UP AND CRIED OUT YOU THIEVING VAGABONDS WHAT BUSINESS HAVE YOU IN MY GROUNDS I'LL GIVE IT YOU WELL FOR YOUR INSOLENCE
BESIDES THE CHANCE OF BEING BOARDED BY THE GIGS WHEREAS THE WAY WE GO THE CURRENT MUST SLACKEN AND THEN WE CAN DODGE BACK ALONG THE SHORE
AND HAVING DONE THIS THEY CREPT AWAY AS SOFTLY AS POSSIBLE HOWEVER THE DUCK WHO SLEPT IN THE OPEN AIR IN THE YARD HEARD THEM COMING AND JUMPING INTO THE BROOK WHICH RAN CLOSE BY THE INN SOON SWAM OUT OF THEIR REACH
NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR THE JOLLY BOAT'S LAST TRIP THIS FIFTH TRIP WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE OTHERS IN THE FIRST PLACE
THAT HAD BEEN LAID TO DRY OVER A BAKER'S OVEN AND THUS SHE HAD SOME JOKE TO CRACK UPON EVERY ONE BUT SHE LAUGHED MORE THAN ALL AT A GOOD KING WHO WAS THERE LOOK AT HIM SAID SHE
HAVE A CLEAN SKILLET WITH A PINT OF BOILING WATER IN IT STIR IT IN AND WHEN DONE SEASON IT WITH SALT TO YOUR TASTE
FOR WE HAD ALL QUIETLY MADE UP OUR MINDS TO TREAT HIM LIKE ONE OF OURSELVES SUDDENLY THE CAPTAIN SPOKE UP AGAIN AND I THOUGHT HIS VOICE WAS A LITTLE CHANGED
NOW PARTLET FOUND A VERY LARGE NUT BUT SHE SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT TO CHANTICLEER AND KEPT IT ALL TO HERSELF
BACKED WITH A GREAT HEAVE THAT SENT HER STERN BODILY UNDER WATER THE REPORT FELL IN AT THE SAME INSTANT OF TIME THIS WAS THE FIRST THAT JIM HEARD THE SOUND OF THE SQUIRE'S SHOT
EVERY THING SHOULD BE PERFECTLY CLEAN AND NICE
WITH ALL MY HEART GET UP BEHIND AND BE SURE YOU DO NOT FALL OFF TAKE CARE OF THIS HANDSOME COACH OF MINE NOR DIRTY MY PRETTY RED WHEELS SO FINE NOW MICE BE READY AND WHEELS RUN STEADY FOR WE ARE GOING A VISIT TO PAY
LET IT STAND COVERED BY THE FIRE A FEW MINUTES WHEN YOU CAN PUT IN SUGAR AND CREAM BLACK TEA BLACK TEA IS MUCH MORE SUITABLE THAN GREEN FOR SICK PERSONS AS IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE NERVES
JACK ASHORE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THEM I MIND IT'S THE ROUND SHOT CARPET BOWLS MY LADY'S MAID COULDN'T MISS TELL US SQUIRE
IF YOU HAVE RENNET IN A BOTTLE OF WINE TWO TEA SPOONSFUL OF IT WILL MAKE A QUART OF WHEY
WHERE ARE YOUR SERVANTS CRIED SHE
AND WELCOMED HER HOME ON HER MARRIAGE JOY WAS IN EVERY FACE AND EVERY HEART THE FEAST WAS GRAND THEY DANCED AND SANG ALL WERE MERRY
IF YOU PLEASE BEAR UP UNTIL YOU SEE YOU'RE GAINING I TRIED AND FOUND BY EXPERIMENT THAT THE TIDE KEPT SWEEPING US WESTWARD UNTIL I HAD LAID HER HEAD DUE EAST
MISTER TRELAWNEY WILL YOU PLEASE PICK ME OFF ONE OF THESE MEN SIR HANDS IF POSSIBLE SAID THE CAPTAIN
IS VERY USEFUL TO STRAIN LEMONADE PANADA OR HERB TEA IF YOU WANT ANY THING TO USE THROUGH THE NIGHT YOU SHOULD PREPARE IT IF POSSIBLE BEFOREHAND AS A PERSON THAT IS SICK CAN SOMETIMES FALL ASLEEP WITHOUT KNOWING IT
THEN SHE WAS IN A GREAT FRIGHT AND CRIED OUT TO CHANTICLEER
ALL HANDS STAND BY TO TRIM HER WHEN HE AIMS THE SQUIRE RAISED HIS GUN THE ROWING CEASED
SET IT OVER THE FIRE TILL IT JUST BOILS AGAIN THEN SET IT OFF TILL THE CURD HAS SETTLED
ON OUR FEET THE OTHER THREE TOOK COMPLETE HEADERS AND CAME UP AGAIN DRENCHED AND BUBBLING SO FAR THERE WAS NO GREAT HARM NO LIVES WERE LOST
TOASTED AND BUTTERED THIS IS A VERY DELICATE WAY OF COOKING EGGS BARLEY PANADA BOIL A SMALL TEA CUP OF BARLEY IN WATER TILL IT IS SOFT WITH A TEA CUP OF RAISINS
AND LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION I SAW THE OTHER PIRATES TROOPING OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES AND TUMBLING INTO THEIR PLACES IN THE BOATS
TRELAWNEY WAS AS COOL AS STEEL HE LOOKED TO THE PRIMING OF HIS GUN NOW CRIED THE CAPTAIN EASY WITH THAT GUN SIR OR YOU'LL SWAMP THE BOAT
TO MISTER KORBES THE FOX TODAY SOON AFTER CAME UP A MILLSTONE AN EGG A DUCK AND A PIN AND CHANTICLEER GAVE THEM ALL LEAVE TO GET INTO THE CARRIAGE AND GO WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT MISTER KORBES'S HOUSE
THAT THE LOG OF WOOD FELL IN AND WAS CARRIED AWAY BY THE STREAM THEN A STONE WHO SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED CAME UP AND KINDLY OFFERED TO HELP POOR CHANTICLEER BY LAYING HIMSELF ACROSS THE STREAM
THE BEAR THE GOAT AND ALL THE BEASTS OF THE WOOD CAME AND CLIMBED UPON THE HEARSE SO ON THEY WENT TILL THEY CAME TO A RAPID STREAM HOW SHALL WE GET OVER SAID CHANTICLEER
THE PIN STUCK HIMSELF INTO THE BED PILLOW THE MILLSTONE LAID HIMSELF OVER THE HOUSE DOOR AND THE EGG ROLLED HIMSELF UP IN THE TOWEL WHEN MISTER KORBES CAME HOME HE WENT TO THE FIREPLACE TO MAKE A FIRE
KING GRISLY BEARD A GREAT KING OF A LAND FAR AWAY IN THE EAST HAD A DAUGHTER WHO WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT SO PROUD AND HAUGHTY AND CONCEITED
LET HIM COME IN SO THEY BROUGHT IN A DIRTY LOOKING FELLOW AND WHEN HE HAD SUNG BEFORE THE KING AND THE PRINCESS HE BEGGED A BOON THEN THE KING SAID
MUTTON MAY BE DONE IN THE SAME WAY MUTTON AND VEAL BROTH BOIL A PIECE OF MUTTON TILL IT COMES TO PIECES THEN STRAIN THE BROTH AND LET IT GET COLD
CREAM TOAST CUT A SLICE OF STALE BREAD AND WET IT WITH CREAM TOAST IT SLOWLY AND BUTTER IT THIS IS VERY NICE FOR AN INVALID AND AN AGREEABLE CHANGE
AND DELAYING OUR ASSAILANTS THE ONE SOURCE OF DANGER WAS THE GUN IF I DURST SAID THE CAPTAIN I'D STOP AND PICK OFF ANOTHER MAN
IT IS A VERY GOOD WAY TO MAKE IT VERY THICK AND THIN IT AFTERWARDS WITH MILK SAGO WASH THE SAGO ALLOWING TWO TABLE SPOONSFUL TO A QUART OF WATER AND SOAK IT AN HOUR
AND CONVEYS NUTRIMENT IN A FORM THAT WILL HARDLY DISAGREE WITH THE MOST DELICATE STOMACH AND HAS BEEN TAKEN WHEN NEARLY ALL OTHER FOOD WAS REJECTED A FEW DROPS OF VINEGAR AND A LITTLE SALT RENDERS IT MORE PALATABLE
RETURNED THE CAPTAIN WE MUST KEEP UPSTREAM YOU SEE SIR HE WENT ON IF ONCE WE DROPPED TO LEEWARD OF THE LANDING PLACE IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE WE SHOULD GET ASHORE
WAS ALREADY MORE THAN SHE WAS MEANT TO CARRY ADD TO THAT THE POWDER PORK AND BREAD BAGS THE GUNWALE WAS LIPPING ASTERN
YOU MUST DO FOR YOURSELF WHATEVER IS TO BE DONE NOW
HOWEVER HE KEPT FAST HOLD AND LED HER IN
BUT IT MADE HER FINGERS VERY SORE I SEE THIS WORK WON'T DO SAID HE TRY AND SPIN PERHAPS YOU WILL DO THAT BETTER SO SHE SAT DOWN AND TRIED TO SPIN
GIVE WAY THEN CRIED THE CAPTAIN WE MUSTN'T MIND IF WE SWAMP HER NOW IF WE CAN'T GET ASHORE ALL'S UP ONLY ONE OF THE GIGS IS BEING MANNED SIR
THEY BELONG TO KING GRISLY BEARD
OR WHETHER THEY WERE LAZY AND WOULD NOT I DO NOT KNOW HOWEVER THEY TOOK IT INTO THEIR HEADS THAT IT DID NOT BECOME THEM TO GO HOME ON FOOT SO CHANTICLEER BEGAN TO BUILD A LITTLE CARRIAGE OF NUTSHELLS AND WHEN IT WAS FINISHED
TO ADD TO OUR CONCERN
I ADDED THE CREW OF THE OTHER MOST LIKELY GOING ROUND BY SHORE TO CUT US OFF THEY'LL HAVE A HOT RUN SIR RETURNED THE CAPTAIN
AND STEW IT IN A SKILLET WITH A LITTLE CREAM AND BUTTER IF IT IS PREFERRED DRY IT MAY BE FRIED IN BUTTER ALONE
POUR IT IN A BOWL ON A SLICE OF TOAST CUT UP AND GRATE A LITTLE NUTMEG OVER PANADA PUT SOME CRACKERS CRUSTS OF DRY BREAD OR DRIED RUSK IN A SAUCE PAN WITH COLD WATER AND A FEW RAISINS
BUT WHEN HE STIRRED IT UP THE EGGSHELLS FLEW INTO HIS EYES AND ALMOST BLINDED HIM BLESS ME SAID HE ALL THE WORLD SEEMS TO HAVE A DESIGN AGAINST MY HEAD THIS MORNING
YOU MUST TRAVEL ON WITH YOUR HUSBAND
CUT IT IN SMALL PIECES BRUISE IT TILL TENDER PUT IT IN A WIDE MOUTHED BOTTLE AND CORK IT TIGHT
BUT DO NOT LET IT BURN PUT IT IN A PITCHER AND POUR BOILING WATER ON IT TOAST WATER WILL ALLAY THIRST BETTER THAN ALMOST ANY THING ELSE IF IT IS WANTED TO DRINK THROUGH THE NIGHT IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE MADE EARLY IN THE EVENING
IT IS A COOLING DRINK IN FEVERS IF THE WEATHER IS COLD YOU CAN MAKE A LARGER QUANTITY SOME BOIL WHOLE RAISINS WITH BARLEY TAKE IT WITH OR WITHOUT SEASONING TO POACH EGGS
WE PUT THE BOAT'S HEAD DIRECT FOR THE LANDING PLACE BY THIS TIME WE HAD GOT SO FAR OUT OF THE RUN OF THE CURRENT THAT WE KEPT STEERAGE WAY EVEN AT OUR NECESSARILY GENTLE RATE OF ROWING
I WILL LAY MYSELF ACROSS THE STREAM AND YOU SHALL PASS OVER UPON ME
BEEF FEET SOAK THE FEET AND HAVE THEM NICELY CLEANED BOIL THEM SLOWLY AND TAKE OFF THE SCUM AS IT RISES WHEN THEY ARE SOFT AND TENDER TAKE THEM UP AND SEPARATE THE BONES FROM THE GLUTINOUS PART
THE GUN SAID HE I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID I FOR I MADE SURE HE WAS THINKING OF A BOMBARDMENT OF THE FORT THEY COULD NEVER GET THE GUN ASHORE
THEN HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND WENT WITHOUT HIS SUPPER TO BED BUT WHEN HE LAID HIS HEAD ON THE PILLOW THE PIN RAN INTO HIS CHEEK AT THIS HE BECAME QUITE FURIOUS AND JUMPING UP WOULD HAVE RUN OUT OF THE HOUSE
UNVARYING AS THE SHIP'S CHRONOMETERS AND SELDOM HAVING THE CURIOSITY EVEN TO GO UPON THE DECK HE PASSED
AND IF MISTER FOGG WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS LATE ON REACHING YOKOHAMA THIS TIME WOULD NO DOUBT
STROKE CAPTURED ALL THIRTEEN OF THE TRICKS CONCLUDED THIS FINE CAMPAIGN WITH A BRILLIANT VICTORY THE MONGOLIA WAS DUE AT BOMBAY ON THE TWENTY SECOND SHE ARRIVED ON THE TWENTIETH
THE STEAMER WAS FORCED TO PROCEED SLOWLY AND THE CAPTAIN ESTIMATED THAT SHE WOULD REACH HONG KONG
IT IS THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND TEN MILES FROM SUEZ TO ADEN AT THE OTHER END OF THE RED SEA AND SHE HAS TO TAKE IN A FRESH COAL SUPPLY AND DOES SHE GO FROM SUEZ DIRECTLY TO BOMBAY
NOW THAT A RAILWAY CROSSES THE INDIAN PENINSULA AMONG THE PASSENGERS WAS A NUMBER OF OFFICIALS AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF VARIOUS GRADES
A MAGNIFICENT ROBBERY CONSUL FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS WE DON'T OFTEN HAVE SUCH WINDFALLS BURGLARS ARE GETTING TO BE SO CONTEMPTIBLE NOWADAYS A FELLOW GETS HUNG
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG
WHEREUPON HE WAS REFERRED TO THE

AH SAID MISTER FOGG WITHOUT BETRAYING ANY ASTONISHMENT
A SORT OF TEMPEST AROSE ON THE THIRD OF NOVEMBER
TO A PALANQUIN
WAS NO LONGER AT HONG KONG BUT PROBABLY IN HOLLAND
HAD BROUGHT HIM SHAVING WATER AT EIGHTY FOUR DEGREES FAHRENHEIT INSTEAD OF EIGHTY SIX AND HE WAS AWAITING HIS SUCCESSOR WHO WAS DUE AT THE HOUSE BETWEEN ELEVEN
SHE PASSED HER HAND ACROSS HER FOREHEAD AND REFLECTED A FEW MOMENTS
AND A DOZEN BOATS PUSHED OFF FROM THE SHORE TO GO AND MEET THE STEAMER SOON HER GIGANTIC HULL APPEARED PASSING ALONG BETWEEN THE BANKS AND ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK AS SHE ANCHORED IN THE ROAD
AND ON THE FINEST LINEN CLUB DECANTERS OF A LOST MOULD CONTAINED HIS SHERRY HIS PORT AND HIS CINNAMON SPICED CLARET WHILE HIS BEVERAGES WERE
THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THIS TELEGRAPHIC DISPATCH ABOUT PHILEAS FOGG WAS SENT WERE AS FOLLOWS
HE MADE HIS FOUR HEARTY MEALS EVERY DAY REGARDLESS OF THE MOST PERSISTENT ROLLING AND PITCHING ON THE PART OF THE STEAMER
OR DINED ALL THE RESOURCES OF THE CLUB ITS KITCHENS
EITHER IN SLEEPING OR MAKING HIS TOILET WHEN HE CHOSE TO TAKE A WALK IT WAS WITH A REGULAR STEP IN THE ENTRANCE HALL WITH ITS MOSAIC FLOORING OR IN THE CIRCULAR GALLERY
THE DETECTIVE WAS EVIDENTLY INSPIRED BY THE HOPE OF OBTAINING THE SPLENDID REWARD WHICH WOULD BE THE PRIZE OF SUCCESS AND AWAITED WITH A FEVERISH IMPATIENCE
BRINDISI AND BOMBAY
BETTER ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM THAN THE REST DECLARED THAT NOBODY COULD
SOME RETAINING THE FANTASTIC FASHION OF ANCIENT GALLEYS WERE
HE WAS NEVER SEEN ON
AND SO HER DEPARTURE WAS POSTPONED TILL TO MORROW THANK YOU RETURNED MISTER FOGG DESCENDING MATHEMATICALLY
NEVER TAKING HIS MEALS WITH OTHER MEMBERS MUCH LESS BRINGING A GUEST WITH HIM AND WENT HOME AT EXACTLY MIDNIGHT ONLY TO RETIRE AT ONCE TO BED HE NEVER USED THE COSY CHAMBERS
IN THE WORLD QUITE WELL AND I TOO
TWENTY NINE MINUTES AFTER ELEVEN A M THIS WEDNESDAY SECOND OCTOBER YOU ARE IN MY SERVICE PHILEAS FOGG GOT UP TOOK HIS HAT IN HIS LEFT HAND PUT IT ON HIS HEAD
RIGGING PROVED TOO MUCH
AND GENERALS OF DIVISIONS FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS WHAT WITH THE MILITARY MEN A NUMBER OF RICH YOUNG ENGLISHMEN ON THEIR TRAVELS AND THE HOSPITABLE EFFORTS OF THE PURSER
ITS BUTTERY AND DAIRY AIDED TO CROWD HIS TABLE WITH THEIR MOST SUCCULENT STORES HE WAS SERVED BY THE GRAVEST WAITERS IN DRESS COATS AND SHOES WITH SWAN SKIN SOLES
INTO OBEDIENCE POOR FELLOW FIX CAREFULLY CONCEALED FROM HIM HIS OWN SATISFACTION FOR HAD HE BETRAYED IT
CHAPTER NINE IN WHICH THE RED SEA AND THE INDIAN OCEAN PROVE PROPITIOUS TO THE
INSECTS PHILEAS FOGG WAS A MEMBER OF THE REFORM AND THAT WAS ALL THE WAY IN WHICH HE GOT ADMISSION TO THIS EXCLUSIVE CLUB WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH HE WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE BARINGS WITH WHOM HE HAD AN OPEN CREDIT
A JETTY PIER SOME TWO THOUSAND YARDS ALONG EXTENDED INTO THE ROADSTEAD A NUMBER OF FISHING SMACKS AND COASTING BOATS
INDEFATIGABLY FOR HE HAD FOUND PARTNERS AS ENTHUSIASTIC IN THE GAME AS HIMSELF
THE LATTER BEING EITHER ATTACHED TO THE REGULAR BRITISH FORCES OR
HE IS EXCEPTIONALLY SHREWD AN ENGLISH CRIMINAL YOU KNOW
WHO HEARD WHAT PASSED WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE EMBRACED THE PILOT WHILE FIX WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO TWIST HIS NECK WHAT IS THE STEAMER'S NAME ASKED MISTER FOGG THE CARNATIC
ASKED HE NO IT'S MY MASTER'S AND YOUR MASTER IS HE STAYED ON BOARD
SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT ON THE SIXTH OF NOVEMBER AND THE PASSENGERS FOR JAPAN WOULD HAVE
AS THE PORT CLOCK STRUCK SHE CAN'T BE FAR OFF NOW RETURNED HIS COMPANION HOW LONG WILL SHE STOP AT SUEZ FOUR HOURS LONG ENOUGH TO GET IN HER COAL
HE MUST HAVE TRAVELLED EVERYWHERE AT LEAST IN THE SPIRIT IT WAS AT LEAST CERTAIN THAT PHILEAS FOGG HAD NOT ABSENTED HIMSELF FROM LONDON FOR MANY YEARS THOSE WHO WERE HONOURED BY A
IT WAS HIS NEW MASTER GOING OUT HE HEARD IT SHUT AGAIN IT WAS HIS PREDECESSOR
WHICH CROSSED THE PACIFIC FROM YOKOHAMA TO SAN FRANCISCO MADE A DIRECT CONNECTION WITH THAT FROM HONG KONG AND IT COULD NOT SAIL UNTIL THE LATTER REACHED YOKOHAMA
AT SIGHT FROM HIS ACCOUNT CURRENT WHICH WAS ALWAYS FLUSH WAS PHILEAS FOGG RICH UNDOUBTEDLY BUT THOSE WHO KNEW HIM BEST COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE AND MISTER FOGG
RAVISHED TO BEHOLD THIS CELEBRATED PLACE AND THOUGHT THAT WITH ITS CIRCULAR WALLS AND DISMANTLED FORT IT LOOKED LIKE AN IMMENSE COFFEE CUP AND SAUCER THE FOLLOWING NIGHT
ABOUT WITH FURY AND THE WAVES RUNNING HIGH THE RANGOON REEFED ALL HER SAILS
NEVER FAILED TO ACCEPT WITH GRACEFUL ALACRITY MENTALLY PRONOUNCING FIX THE BEST OF GOOD FELLOWS MEANWHILE THE MONGOLIA WAS PUSHING FORWARD RAPIDLY ON THE THIRTEENTH
A SURNAME WHICH HAS CLUNG TO ME BECAUSE I HAVE A NATURAL APTNESS FOR GOING OUT OF ONE BUSINESS INTO ANOTHER I BELIEVE I'M HONEST MONSIEUR BUT TO BE OUTSPOKEN I'VE HAD SEVERAL TRADES
AND ORIENTAL COMPANY BUILT OF IRON OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TONS BURDEN AND FIVE HUNDRED HORSE POWER WAS DUE AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK A M
FINDING MYSELF OUT OF PLACE AND HEARING THAT MONSIEUR PHILEAS FOGG WAS THE MOST EXACT
I HAVE COME TO MONSIEUR IN THE HOPE OF LIVING WITH HIM A TRANQUIL LIFE AND FORGETTING EVEN THE NAME OF
WHO ARRIVED AT SUEZ AND TO FOLLOW UP ALL WHO SEEMED TO BE SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS OR BORE A RESEMBLANCE TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CRIMINAL WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED TWO DAYS BEFORE FROM THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS AT LONDON
IN HIS DELIGHT EXCLAIMING PILOT YOU ARE THE BEST OF GOOD FELLOWS THE PILOT PROBABLY DOES NOT KNOW TO THIS DAY WHY HIS RESPONSES WON HIM THIS ENTHUSIASTIC GREETING
WHISTLES WHICH ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF THE MONGOLIA
OF GYMNASTICS SO AS TO MAKE BETTER USE OF MY TALENTS AND THEN I WAS A SERGEANT FIREMAN AT PARIS
WEATHER EVERYTHING HAD GONE SO WELL TILL NOW EARTH AND SEA HAD SEEMED TO BE AT HIS MASTER'S SERVICE STEAMERS AND RAILWAYS OBEYED HIM
TO REMAIN AT THE HOTEL UNTIL HIS RETURN THAT AOUDA MIGHT NOT BE LEFT ENTIRELY ALONE MISTER FOGG REPAIRED TO THE EXCHANGE WHERE HE DID NOT DOUBT EVERY ONE
AND RECEIVING HIGH SALARIES EVER SINCE THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS ASSUMED THE POWERS OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY FOR THE SUB LIEUTENANTS
ONE WAS THE BRITISH CONSUL AT SUEZ WHO DESPITE THE PROPHECIES OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT AND THE UNFAVOURABLE
ASKED PHILEAS FOGG AND YOUR NAME IS JOHN JEAN IF MONSIEUR PLEASES REPLIED THE NEWCOMER
HE MADE NO ACCOUNT OF THIS INCONVENIENCE AND WHILST HIS BODY WAS WRITHING UNDER THEIR EFFECTS HIS SPIRIT BOUNDED WITH HOPEFUL EXULTATION
MISTER FOGG BOLDER THAN HIS SERVANT DID NOT HESITATE TO APPROACH THE PILOT AND TRANQUILLY ASK HIM IF HE KNEW WHEN A STEAMER WOULD LEAVE HONG KONG FOR YOKOHAMA AT HIGH TIDE TO MORROW MORNING ANSWERED THE PILOT
HE WOULD NATURALLY TAKE THE ROUTE VIA INDIA WHICH WAS LESS WATCHED AND MORE DIFFICULT TO WATCH THAN THAT OF THE ATLANTIC BUT FIX'S REFLECTIONS WERE SOON INTERRUPTED BY A SUCCESSION OF SHARP
HE REMOUNTED THE BRIDGE AND GUIDED THE STEAMER THROUGH THE FLOTILLA OF JUNKS
OF THE NEXT STEAMER MISTER FOGG WAS IT IS TRUE TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEHIND HIS TIME BUT THIS COULD NOT SERIOUSLY IMPERIL THE REMAINDER OF HIS TOUR THE STEAMER
OR THE LONDON INSTITUTION THE ARTISAN'S ASSOCIATION OR THE INSTITUTION OF ARTS AND SCIENCES HE BELONGED IN FACT TO NONE OF THE NUMEROUS SOCIETIES
TO TAKE IN COAL THIS MATTER OF FUELLING STEAMERS IS A SERIOUS ONE AT SUCH DISTANCES FROM THE COAL MINES IT
HIS NAME WAS STRANGE TO THE SCIENTIFIC AND LEARNED SOCIETIES AND HE NEVER WAS KNOWN TO TAKE PART IN THE SAGE DELIBERATIONS OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTION
IMPORTUNATE CROWD OF PORTERS CAME UP TO HIM AND POLITELY ASKED IF HE COULD POINT OUT THE ENGLISH CONSULATE AT THE SAME TIME SHOWING A PASSPORT
CONSULATE THERE ON THE CORNER OF THE SQUARE SAID FIX POINTING TO A HOUSE TWO HUNDRED STEPS OFF I'LL GO AND FETCH MY MASTER WHO WON'T BE MUCH PLEASED HOWEVER TO BE DISTURBED
FAITH MONSIEUR FIX I ASSURE YOU I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT NOR WOULD I GIVE HALF A CROWN TO FIND OUT
THEN YOU KNOW INDIA WHY YES REPLIED FIX WHO SPOKE CAUTIOUSLY A CURIOUS PLACE THIS INDIA
THE NEXT MORNING MISTER FOGG HAD SIXTEEN HOURS IN WHICH TO ATTEND TO HIS BUSINESS THERE WHICH WAS
AND TOOK HIS MEALS CONSCIENTIOUSLY
BUT A REAL ART MISTER FIX EVIDENTLY WAS NOT WANTING
ON RETURNING TO THE STEAMER I SEE THAT IT IS BY NO MEANS USELESS TO TRAVEL IF A MAN WANTS TO SEE SOMETHING NEW AT SIX P M THE MONGOLIA SLOWLY MOVED OUT OF THE ROADSTEAD AND WAS SOON ONCE MORE ON THE INDIAN OCEAN
YOU MUST HAVE A SCENT FOR THEM AND A SCENT IS LIKE A SIXTH SENSE WHICH COMBINES HEARING SEEING AND SMELLING I'VE ARRESTED MORE THAN ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN IN MY TIME AND IF MY THIEF IS ON BOARD
IN THE VOYAGE OF TWENTY TWO DAYS ACROSS THE PACIFIC HE FOUND HIMSELF THEN ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEHIND HAND THIRTY FIVE DAYS AFTER LEAVING LONDON THE
SIGNALLED UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THE SIXTH THE STEAMER WAS DUE ON THE FIFTH PHILEAS FOGG WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEHIND HAND AND THE YOKOHAMA STEAMER WOULD OF COURSE BE MISSED
AND THE PASSENGERS WERE GOING ASHORE CHANCE HAD STRANGELY FAVOURED PHILEAS FOGG
AS LONG AS THE TEMPEST LASTED BEING UNABLE TO REMAIN QUIET BELOW AND TAKING IT
MISTER FOGG WOULD ACCORDING TO HIS DAILY HABIT
HE WAS PLEASED ON THE DAY AFTER LEAVING SUEZ TO FIND ON DECK
AND VILLAGES WHICH ALONG ITS BORDERS RAISED THEIR
IN ASIA BY SOME OTHER ROUTE HE OUGHT TO KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SAFE AN HOUR IN INDIA WHICH IS ENGLISH SOIL
THE PILOT WENT ON BOARD AT SIX AND TOOK HIS PLACE ON THE BRIDGE TO GUIDE THE RANGOON THROUGH THE CHANNELS TO THE PORT OF HONG KONG
CONGENIAL TO HIS TASTES PHILEAS FOGG WAS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE EITHER WIFE OR CHILDREN WHICH MAY HAPPEN TO THE MOST HONEST PEOPLE EITHER RELATIVES
MAN'S CONFIDENCE HE FREQUENTLY OFFERED HIM A GLASS OF WHISKEY OR PALE ALE IN THE STEAMER BAR ROOM
HE WAS STEADILY WATCHING A COMPLICATED CLOCK WHICH INDICATED THE HOURS THE MINUTES THE SECONDS THE DAYS THE MONTHS AND THE YEARS
ABOUT WHOM LITTLE WAS KNOWN EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A POLISHED MAN OF THE WORLD PEOPLE SAID THAT HE RESEMBLED BYRON
SOME DAYS AT HONG KONG AND NOW THE HEAVENS THEMSELVES BECAME HIS ALLIES WITH THE GUSTS AND SQUALLS IT MATTERED NOT THAT THEY MADE HIM SEA SICK
FIX DID NOT LOOK AT THE STATE OF THINGS IN THE SAME LIGHT THE STORM GREATLY PLEASED HIM HIS SATISFACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETE HAD THE RANGOON BEEN FORCED TO RETREAT
THIS WAS A GAIN TO PHILEAS FOGG OF TWO DAYS SINCE HIS DEPARTURE FROM LONDON AND HE CALMLY ENTERED THE FACT IN THE
ON THE RED SEA AS HE PASSED AMONG THE BUSY CROWD FIX ACCORDING TO HABIT SCRUTINISED
MAY CONCEAL SOME SECRET ERRAND
MINARETS TEMPLES FAKIRS PAGODAS TIGERS SNAKES ELEPHANTS I HOPE YOU WILL HAVE AMPLE TIME TO SEE THE SIGHTS I HOPE SO MONSIEUR FIX YOU SEE
SO AS TO ESTABLISH HIS IDENTITY
THEY PASSED THROUGH THE STRAIT OF
BY AT LEAST A HALF THE OTHER WAS A SMALL SLIGHT BUILT PERSONAGE WITH A NERVOUS INTELLIGENT FACE AND BRIGHT EYES PEERING OUT FROM UNDER EYEBROWS WHICH
BEING RESERVED AS A FUND FOR HIS CHARITIES MISTER FOGG PLAYED NOT TO WIN BUT FOR THE SAKE OF PLAYING THE GAME WAS IN HIS EYES A CONTEST
NOT SUMPTUOUS WAS EXCEEDINGLY COMFORTABLE
ALWAYS MAKING MORE THAN TEN KNOTS AN HOUR BETWEEN BRINDISI AND SUEZ AND NINE AND A HALF BETWEEN SUEZ AND BOMBAY TWO MEN
KNOW MY CONDITIONS YES MONSIEUR GOOD WHAT TIME IS IT TWENTY TWO MINUTES AFTER ELEVEN
OF THE CURIOUS WERE FAIRLY PUZZLED HAD HE TRAVELLED IT WAS LIKELY FOR NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW THE WORLD MORE FAMILIARLY
OUGHT NOT TO SPEND HIS LIFE JUMPING FROM A STEAMER UPON A RAILWAY TRAIN AND FROM A RAILWAY TRAIN UPON A STEAMER AGAIN
TO HAVE THE PASSPORT AGAIN VISAED FIX UNOBSERVED FOLLOWED THEM THE VISA PROCURED MISTER FOGG RETURNED ON BOARD TO RESUME HIS FORMER HABITS
COSTS THE PENINSULAR COMPANY SOME EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR IN THESE DISTANT SEAS COAL IS WORTH THREE OR FOUR POUNDS STERLING A TON THE MONGOLIA HAD STILL SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES TO TRAVERSE
HIS ANXIETY TO FIX WHO THE SLY RASCAL TRIED TO CONSOLE HIM BY SAYING THAT MISTER FOGG
THAT HE DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE AN INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH IT HE OFTEN CORRECTED WITH A FEW CLEAR WORDS THE THOUSAND CONJECTURES ADVANCED BY MEMBERS OF THE CLUB AS TO LOST
AND UNHEARD OF TRAVELLERS POINTING OUT THE TRUE PROBABILITIES AND SEEMING AS IF
CHAPTER SIX IN WHICH FIX THE DETECTIVE
HE TALKED VERY LITTLE AND SEEMED ALL THE MORE MYSTERIOUS FOR HIS TACITURN MANNER HIS DAILY HABITS WERE QUITE OPEN TO OBSERVATION
GREAT ROBBERS ALWAYS RESEMBLE HONEST FOLKS FELLOWS WHO HAVE RASCALLY FACES HAVE ONLY ONE COURSE TO TAKE AND THAT IS TO REMAIN HONEST OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE ARRESTED OFF HAND
I'LL ANSWER FOR IT HE'LL NOT SLIP THROUGH MY FINGERS I HOPE SO MISTER FIX
AND THE STORM LESSENED ITS VIOLENCE THE WIND VEERED SOUTHWARD AND WAS ONCE MORE FAVOURABLE
DRAWING AN ENORMOUS SILVER WATCH FROM THE DEPTHS OF HIS POCKET YOU ARE TOO SLOW SAID MISTER FOGG PARDON ME MONSIEUR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE YOU ARE FOUR MINUTES TOO SLOW NO MATTER IT'S ENOUGH TO MENTION THE ERROR
FIX LEFT ALONE WAS MORE IMPATIENT THAN EVER HAVING A PRESENTIMENT THAT THE ROBBER WAS ON BOARD THE MONGOLIA IF HE HAD INDEED LEFT LONDON INTENDING TO REACH THE NEW WORLD
WHICH SWARM IN THE ENGLISH CAPITAL FROM THE HARMONIC TO THAT OF THE ENTOMOLOGISTS FOUNDED MAINLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ABOLISHING
ENRAGED BEYOND EXPRESSION BY THE
BLEW A GALE AND RETARDED THE STEAMER THE RANGOON ROLLED HEAVILY AND THE PASSENGERS BECAME IMPATIENT OF THE LONG MONSTROUS WAVES WHICH THE WIND RAISED BEFORE THEIR PATH
AFTER THE ENGINEERS OF SOLOMON
OR NEAR FRIENDS WHICH IS CERTAINLY MORE UNUSUAL HE LIVED ALONE IN HIS HOUSE
WAS ENCHANTED WITH THE CONGENIAL
THEN THE LADIES SPEEDILY DISAPPEARED BELOW THE PIANOS WERE SILENT SINGING AND DANCING SUDDENLY CEASED YET THE GOOD SHIP PLOUGHED STRAIGHT ON UNRETARDED
BUT HE WAS A BEARDED TRANQUIL BYRON WHO MIGHT LIVE ON A THOUSAND YEARS WITHOUT GROWING OLD CERTAINLY AN ENGLISHMAN IT WAS MORE DOUBTFUL WHETHER PHILEAS FOGG WAS A LONDONER
THAT HE HAD ALWAYS DONE BEFORE
IT'S THE SEA AIR BUT I NEVER SEE YOUR MASTER ON DECK NEVER
WAS THE LAST PERSON TO WHOM TO APPLY FOR THE INFORMATION HE WAS NOT LAVISH NOR ON THE CONTRARY
THE TIME PASSED QUICKLY ON THE MONGOLIA THE BEST OF FARE WAS SPREAD UPON THE CABIN TABLES AT BREAKFAST LUNCH DINNER AND THE EIGHT O'CLOCK SUPPER AND THE LADIES
WITH AN AUTOMATIC MOTION AND WENT OFF WITHOUT A WORD
IF THE STEAMER HAD LEFT FOR YOKOHAMA BUT HE DARED NOT FOR HE WISHED TO PRESERVE THE SPARK OF HOPE WHICH STILL REMAINED TILL THE LAST MOMENT HE HAD CONFIDED
SEEING FROM HIS OFFICE WINDOW ENGLISH SHIPS DAILY PASSING TO AND FRO ON THE GREAT CANAL BY WHICH THE OLD ROUNDABOUT ROUTE FROM ENGLAND TO INDIA BY THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE WAS ABRIDGED
BUT PHILEAS FOGG REQUIRED HIM TO BE ALMOST SUPERHUMANLY PROMPT AND REGULAR ON THIS VERY SECOND OF OCTOBER HE HAD DISMISSED JAMES FORSTER
BUT WITH NO PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT FOR NEITHER SHAKING NOR MALEDICTIONS COULD PREVAIL UPON IT TO CHANGE ITS MIND ON THE FOURTH HOWEVER THE SEA BECAME MORE CALM
NERVOUSLY PACING UP AND DOWN AND UNABLE TO STAND STILL FOR A MOMENT THIS WAS FIX ONE OF THE DETECTIVES WHO HAD BEEN DISPATCHED FROM ENGLAND IN SEARCH OF THE BANK ROBBER IT WAS HIS TASK TO NARROWLY WATCH EVERY PASSENGER
AMONG THE CROWD OF NATIVES AND STRANGERS WHO WERE SOJOURNING AT THIS ONCE STRAGGLING VILLAGE NOW THANKS TO THE ENTERPRISE OF M LESSEPS A FAST GROWING TOWN
WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE NO INTENTION OF RISING
JUST SO MONSIEUR FIX
AND HALF PAST PHILEAS FOGG WAS SEATED SQUARELY IN HIS ARMCHAIR HIS FEET CLOSE TOGETHER LIKE THOSE OF A GRENADIER ON PARADE HIS HANDS RESTING ON HIS KNEES HIS BODY STRAIGHT HIS HEAD ERECT
WITH A SORT OF SECOND SIGHT SO OFTEN DID EVENTS JUSTIFY HIS
THE PERSON OF THE DELIGHTFUL FIX ON SUNDAY OCTOBER TWENTIETH TOWARDS NOON THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE INDIAN COAST TWO HOURS LATER THE PILOT CAME ON BOARD
A ROOM WAS ENGAGED FOR THE YOUNG WOMAN AND MISTER FOGG AFTER SEEING THAT SHE WANTED FOR NOTHING
A GONDOLIER AN ABBE TO BE EXPOSED TO ABUSE AND INSULTS TO BE OFTEN REDUCED TO BORROWING A PETTICOAT ONLY TO GO AND HAVE IT RAISED BY A DISAGREEABLE MAN
WELL SAID HE HAVE I NOT WON THE WHOLE WAGER
WHICH WAS AS FOLLOWS MY FRIENDS I AM GOING TO DO THAT WHICH THE DEAD OFTEN PROMISED HE WOULD DO FOR ME THE LOVED AND LOVING BROTHER HUSBAND FATHER FRIEND
I SAY WHAT I THINK AND I CARE VERY LITTLE WHETHER OTHERS THINK AS I DO
AND A FRIEND OF THE OPPRESSED A THOUSAND TIMES I HAVE HEARD HIM QUOTE THE WORDS FOR JUSTICE ALL PLACE A TEMPLE AND ALL SEASON SUMMER HE BELIEVED THAT HAPPINESS WAS THE ONLY GOOD
ANOTHER LIFE IS NAUGHT UNLESS WE KNOW AND LOVE AGAIN THE ONES WHO LOVE US HERE THEY WHO STAND WITH BREAKING HEARTS AROUND THIS LITTLE GRAVE NEED HAVE NO FEAR
MY PARENTS FORCED ME AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN TO PUT ON THIS DETESTABLE HABIT TO INCREASE THE FORTUNE OF A CURSED ELDER BROTHER WHOM GOD CONFOUND JEALOUSY DISCORD AND FURY DWELL IN THE CONVENT
BRIGHTENING AND SOBS BECOMING HUSHED THE COLONEL SAID MY FRIENDS I KNOW HOW VAIN IT IS TO GILD A GRIEF WITH WORDS AND YET I WISH TO TAKE FROM EVERY GRAVE ITS FEAR
THE UNDERTAKER GAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE NOD MISTER MILLER LOOKED APPEALINGLY TOWARD THE DISTINGUISHED ORATOR AND THEN COLONEL INGERSOLL ADVANCED TO THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE MADE A MOTION DENOTING A DESIRE FOR SILENCE
YOU SANG AND YOU BEHAVED SO LOVINGLY TO THE THEATIN THAT YOU SEEMED TO ME AS HAPPY AS YOU PRETEND TO BE NOW THE REVERSE AH SIR ANSWERED PAQUETTE
WHICH APPEARS SO PLEASANT TO YOU MEN WHILE TO US WOMEN IT IS THE UTMOST ABYSS OF MISERY I HAVE COME TO EXERCISE THE PROFESSION AT VENICE
I MAKE THEM LIE WITH ME SOMETIMES FOR I AM VERY TIRED OF THE LADIES OF THE TOWN OF THEIR COQUETRIES OF THEIR JEALOUSIES OF THEIR QUARRELS OF THEIR HUMOURS OF THEIR PETTINESSES
IF HE FIND HER HE WILL KEEP HER TO HIMSELF IF HE DO NOT FIND HER HE WILL GET ANOTHER I ADVISE YOU TO FORGET YOUR VALET CACAMBO AND YOUR MISTRESS CUNEGONDE MARTIN WAS NOT CONSOLING
THAT TROY SO LONG BESIEGED WITHOUT BEING TAKEN ALL THESE TOGETHER CAUSED ME GREAT WEARINESS I HAVE SOMETIMES ASKED LEARNED MEN WHETHER THEY WERE NOT AS WEARY AS I OF THAT WORK
THIS CATASTROPHE MADE A GREAT NOISE FOR SOME HOURS
IT MAY BE THAT DEATH GIVES ALL THERE IS OF WORTH TO LIFE IF THOSE WHO PRESS AND STRAIN AGAINST OUR HEARTS COULD NEVER DIE PERHAPS THAT LOVE WOULD WITHER FROM THE EARTH
HE CLIMBED THE HEIGHTS AND LEFT ALL SUPERSTITIONS FAR BELOW WHILE ON HIS FOREHEAD FELL THE GOLDEN DAWNING OF A GRANDER DAY HE LOVED THE BEAUTIFUL
OR HE WHO JOURNEYS ALL THE LENGTH OF LIFE'S UNEVEN ROAD PAINFULLY TAKING THE LAST SLOW STEPS WITH STAFF AND CRUTCH EVERY CRADLE ASKS US WHENCE AND EVERY COFFIN WHITHER
THIS IS THE PRIVILEGE OF HUMANITY IN ALL OUR ITALY WE WRITE ONLY WHAT WE DO NOT THINK THOSE WHO INHABIT THE COUNTRY OF THE CAESARS AND THE ANTONINUSES DARE NOT ACQUIRE A SINGLE IDEA WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF A DOMINICAN FRIAR
IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER
I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY
MAYBE A COMMON FAITH TREADS FROM OUT THE PATHS BETWEEN OUR HEARTS THE WEEDS OF SELFISHNESS AND I SHOULD RATHER LIVE AND LOVE WHERE DEATH IS KING THAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE WHERE LOVE IS NOT
IT IS TRUE I HAVE PREACHED A FEW BAD SERMONS THAT HAVE BROUGHT ME IN A LITTLE MONEY OF WHICH THE PRIOR STOLE HALF WHILE THE REST SERVES TO MAINTAIN MY GIRLS
AND THERE IS NOTHING FOR ME BUT TO DIE
WE CANNOT SAY THAT DEATH IS NOT GOOD WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE GRAVE IS THE END OF THIS LIFE OR THE DOOR OF ANOTHER OR WHETHER THE NIGHT HERE IS NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE A DAWN
AT LEAST YOU WILL ALLOW ME SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN THAT THESE TWO ARE HAPPY HITHERTO I HAVE MET WITH NONE BUT UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE HABITABLE GLOBE EXCEPT IN EL DORADO BUT AS TO THIS PAIR I WOULD VENTURE TO LAY A WAGER THAT THEY ARE VERY HAPPY I LAY YOU THEY ARE NOT SAID MARTIN
TO BE DISSECTED TO ROW IN THE GALLEYS IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE
IN EXTREME MISERY THEY HAD SOON SQUANDERED THEIR THREE THOUSAND PIASTRES PARTED WERE RECONCILED QUARRELLED AGAIN
YOU SEE THAT ALREADY I HAVE WON HALF THE WAGER FRIAR GIROFLEE STAYED IN THE DINING ROOM AND DRANK A GLASS OR TWO OF WINE WHILE HE WAS WAITING FOR DINNER BUT SAID CANDIDE TO PAQUETTE YOU LOOKED SO GAY AND CONTENT WHEN I MET YOU
THE LARGEST AND THE NOBLER FAITH IN ALL THAT IS AND IS TO BE TELLS US THAT DEATH EVEN AT ITS WORST IS ONLY PERFECT REST
THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT THEY SAID NOT A WORD TO HIS SISTER THE THING WAS EXECUTED FOR A LITTLE MONEY AND THEY HAD THE DOUBLE PLEASURE OF ENTRAPPING A JESUIT AND PUNISHING THE PRIDE OF A GERMAN BARON
CANDIDE'S MELANCHOLY INCREASED AND MARTIN CONTINUED TO PROVE TO HIM THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE VIRTUE OR HAPPINESS UPON EARTH EXCEPT PERHAPS IN EL DORADO WHERE NOBODY COULD GAIN ADMITTANCE WHILE THEY WERE DISPUTING ON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT
COLONEL INGERSOLL WAS UNPROTECTED BY EITHER HAT OR UMBRELLA
I HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE FRIGHTFUL DISASTERS THAT BEFELL THE FAMILY OF MY LADY BARONESS AND THE FAIR CUNEGONDE I SWEAR TO YOU THAT MY FATE HAS BEEN SCARCELY LESS SAD
I THINK THERE CAN BE NOTHING MORE FLAT AND DISAGREEABLE I PREFER TASSO A GOOD DEAL OR EVEN THE SOPORIFIC TALES OF ARIOSTO
HE CONSULTED PANGLOSS MARTIN AND THE FAITHFUL CACAMBO
IMMEDIATELY HE ACCOSTED THEM
AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
HE ONE DAY GAVE HER SO EFFECTUAL A REMEDY TO CURE HER OF A SLIGHT COLD THAT SHE DIED TWO HOURS AFTER IN MOST HORRID CONVULSIONS THE WIFE'S RELATIONS PROSECUTED THE HUSBAND HE TOOK FLIGHT AND I WAS THROWN INTO JAIL
CANDIDE HAD NOT VIEWED HER AS YET WITH ATTENTION HIS THOUGHTS BEING ENTIRELY TAKEN UP WITH CUNEGONDE BUT RECOLLECTING HER AS SHE SPOKE
YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT MY DEAR MARTIN ALL IS MISERY AND ILLUSION HE FELL INTO A DEEP MELANCHOLY AND NEITHER WENT TO SEE THE OPERA NOR ANY OF THE OTHER DIVERSIONS OF THE CARNIVAL
ALMOST OF JOY THERE IS FOR THEM THIS CONSOLATION THE DEAD DO NOT SUFFER IF THEY LIVE AGAIN THEIR LIVES WILL SURELY BE AS GOOD AS OURS WE HAVE NO FEAR
THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
FOR MARTIN HE WAS FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT HE WOULD BE AS BADLY OFF ELSEWHERE AND THEREFORE BORE THINGS PATIENTLY
BUT IN ALL THESE VOLUMES THERE IS NOTHING BUT CHIMERICAL SYSTEMS AND NOT A SINGLE USEFUL THING AND WHAT DRAMATIC WORKS I SEE HERE SAID CANDIDE IN ITALIAN SPANISH AND FRENCH YES
YOU KNOW SIR WHAT A DANGEROUS THING IT IS FOR AN ILL NATURED WOMAN TO BE MARRIED TO A DOCTOR INCENSED AT THE BEHAVIOUR OF HIS WIFE
THE FLOWER OF HEALTH SHINES IN YOUR FACE YOUR EXPRESSION MAKES PLAIN YOUR HAPPINESS YOU HAVE A VERY PRETTY GIRL FOR YOUR RECREATION AND YOU SEEM WELL SATISFIED WITH YOUR STATE AS A THEATIN MY FAITH SIR SAID FRIAR GIROFLEE
ARE TRUE OF ALL THE COUNTLESS DEAD AND NOW TO YOU WHO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FROM AMONG THE MANY MEN HE LOVED TO DO THE LAST SAD OFFICE FOR THE DEAD WE GIVE HIS SACRED DUST
THEY INCLUDED DETECTIVE AND MISSUS GEORGE O MILLER AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO HAD GATHERED TO WITNESS THE BURIAL OF THE FORMER'S BRIGHT LITTLE SON HARRY AS THE CASKET RESTED UPON THE TRESTLES THERE WAS A PAINFUL PAUSE
AND IN A VOICE OF EXQUISITE CADENCE DELIVERED ONE OF HIS CHARACTERISTIC EULOGIES FOR THE DEAD
AND THE SAME FATE AWAITS US ALL WE TOO HAVE OUR RELIGION AND IT IS THIS HELP FOR THE LIVING HOPE FOR THE DEAD
FOR WHETHER IN MID SEA OR AMONG THE BREAKERS OF THE FARTHER SHORE A WRECK MUST MARK AT LAST THE END OF EACH AND ALL AND EVERY LIFE NO MATTER IF ITS EVERY HOUR IS RICH WITH LOVE
THE SCENE WAS INTENSELY DRAMATIC A FINE DRIZZLING RAIN WAS FALLING AND EVERY HEAD WAS BENT AND EVERY EAR TURNED TO CATCH THE IMPASSIONED WORDS OF ELOQUENCE AND HOPE THAT FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE FAMED ORATOR
THOSE GODS THAT ARE ALWAYS ACTIVE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING DECISIVE THAT HELEN WHO IS THE CAUSE OF THE WAR AND WHO YET SCARCELY APPEARS IN THE PIECE
AND HIS ACCOUNT OF A BAD DINNER OR OF HIS LOW QUARREL BETWEEN ONE RUPILIUS WHOSE WORDS HE SAYS WERE FULL OF POISONOUS FILTH AND ANOTHER WHOSE LANGUAGE WAS IMBUED WITH VINEGAR I HAVE READ WITH MUCH DISTASTE HIS INDELICATE VERSES AGAINST OLD WOMEN AND WITCHES
BUT HE COULD NOT DO IT AND FINALLY HE BOWED HIS HEAD UPON THE DEAD MAN'S COFFIN IN UNCONTROLLABLE GRIEF IT WAS AFTER SOME DELAY AND THE GREATEST EFFORTS OF SELF MASTERY THAT COLONEL INGERSOLL WAS ABLE TO FINISH READING HIS ADDRESS
SPEECH CAN NOT CONTAIN OUR LOVE THERE WAS THERE IS NO GENTLER STRONGER
HERE IN THIS WORLD WHERE LIFE AND DEATH ARE EQUAL KINGS ALL SHOULD BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO MEET WHAT ALL HAVE MET THE FUTURE HAS BEEN FILLED WITH FEAR STAINED AND POLLUTED BY THE HEARTLESS PAST
JUST IN THE HAPPIEST SUNNIEST HOUR OF ALL THE VOYAGE WHILE EAGER WINDS ARE KISSING EVERY SAIL TO DASH AGAINST THE UNSEEN ROCK AND IN AN INSTANT HEAR THE BILLOWS ROAR OVER A SUNKEN SHIP
I GRANT SAID THE SENATOR THAT THE SECOND FOURTH AND SIXTH BOOKS OF HIS A ENEID ARE EXCELLENT
BUT IN THE NIGHT OF DEATH HOPE SEES A STAR AND LISTENING LOVE CAN HEAR THE RUSTLE OF A WING HE WHO SLEEPS HERE WHEN DYING MISTAKING THE APPROACH OF DEATH FOR THE RETURN OF HEALTH
I KNOW OF NOTHING IN SO BAD A TASTE SAID THE MASTER ALL YOU SEE HERE IS MERELY TRIFLING AFTER TO MORROW I WILL HAVE IT PLANTED WITH A NOBLER DESIGN
THERE ARE MAXIMS IN THIS WRITER ANSWERED POCOCURANTE FROM WHICH A MAN OF THE WORLD MAY REAP GREAT BENEFIT AND BEING WRITTEN IN ENERGETIC VERSE THEY ARE MORE EASILY IMPRESSED UPON THE MEMORY
NEITHER CAN WE TELL WHICH IS THE MORE FORTUNATE THE CHILD DYING IN ITS MOTHER'S ARMS BEFORE ITS LIPS HAVE LEARNED TO FORM A WORD
BUT THERE WAS NO NEWS OF CACAMBO
TO BE RAVISHED A HUNDRED TIMES BY NEGRO PIRATES TO HAVE A BUTTOCK CUT OFF TO RUN THE GAUNTLET AMONG THE BULGARIANS TO BE WHIPPED AND HANGED AT AN AUTO DA FE
YOU MAY WELL IMAGINE THAT NEITHER I NOR ANY ONE ELSE EVER OPENS THEM MARTIN SAW SOME SHELVES FILLED WITH ENGLISH BOOKS
LET THAT BE AS IT MAY SAID CANDIDE BUT ONE THING CONSOLES ME I SEE THAT WE OFTEN MEET WITH THOSE WHOM WE EXPECTED NEVER TO SEE MORE SO THAT PERHAPS AS I HAVE FOUND MY RED SHEEP AND PAQUETTE
ALAS SAID HE SOFTLY TO MARTIN I AM AFRAID THAT THIS MAN HOLDS OUR GERMAN POETS IN VERY GREAT CONTEMPT THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH HARM IN THAT SAID MARTIN
FIRST TWO PRETTY GIRLS VERY NEATLY DRESSED SERVED THEM WITH CHOCOLATE WHICH WAS FROTHED EXCEEDINGLY WELL CANDIDE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM COMMENDING THEIR BEAUTY GRACE AND ADDRESS THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH CREATURES SAID THE SENATOR
ARE ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST TASTE AND HIS LONG DESCRIPTION OF A PEST HOUSE IS GOOD ONLY FOR A GRAVE DIGGER
TO BE ROBBED BY ONE OF WHAT ONE HAS EARNED FROM ANOTHER TO BE SUBJECT TO THE EXTORTIONS OF THE OFFICERS OF JUSTICE AND TO HAVE IN PROSPECT ONLY A FRIGHTFUL OLD AGE A HOSPITAL AND A DUNG HILL
REASON THE ONLY TORCH JUSTICE THE ONLY WORSHIPER HUMANITY THE ONLY RELIGION AND LOVE THE PRIEST HE ADDED TO THE SUM OF HUMAN JOY
SHE LOOKED AMOROUSLY AT HER THEATIN AND FROM TIME TO TIME PINCHED HIS FAT CHEEKS
IN POINTING OUT FAULTS WHERE OTHERS SEE NOTHING BUT BEAUTIES THAT IS TO SAY REPLIED MARTIN THAT THERE IS SOME PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE WELL
BUT BEING WEARY FOR A MOMENT HE LAY DOWN BY THE WAYSIDE AND USING HIS BURDEN FOR A PILLOW FELL INTO THAT DREAMLESS SLEEP THAT KISSES DOWN HIS EYELIDS STILL
MARTIN WAS FOR THROWING THE BARON INTO THE SEA CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP
ALAS IT WAS I SIR INDEED ANSWERED PAQUETTE I SEE THAT YOU HAVE HEARD ALL
HA HERE ARE FOUR SCORE VOLUMES OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CRIED MARTIN PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING VALUABLE IN THIS COLLECTION
PAQUETTE CONTINUED HER TRADE WHEREVER SHE WENT BUT MADE NOTHING OF IT
PAQUETTE WORKED AT EMBROIDERY THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
THIS GENTLEMAN WAS COLONEL ROBERT G INGERSOLL A FRIEND OF THE MILLERS WHO HAD ATTENDED THE FUNERAL AT THEIR REQUEST HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WHEN THE UNDERTAKER FIRST ADDRESSED HIM AND THEN SAID SUDDENLY DOES MISSUS MILLER DESIRE IT
HE SIDED WITH THE WEAK AND WITH A WILLING HAND GAVE ALMS WITH LOYAL HEART AND WITH THE PUREST HAND HE FAITHFUL DISCHARGED ALL PUBLIC TRUSTS HE WAS A WORSHIPER OF LIBERTY
OH WHAT A SUPERIOR MAN SAID CANDIDE BELOW HIS BREATH WHAT A GREAT GENIUS IS THIS POCOCURANTE NOTHING CAN PLEASE HIM
THIS OBSCURE WHIMSICAL AND DISAGREEABLE POEM WAS DESPISED UPON ITS FIRST PUBLICATION AND I ONLY TREAT IT NOW AS IT WAS TREATED IN ITS OWN COUNTRY BY CONTEMPORARIES FOR THE MATTER OF THAT
SUCH SPECTACLES AS THESE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF THEIR DISSERTATIONS AND WHEN THEY DID NOT DISPUTE TIME HUNG SO HEAVILY UPON THEIR HANDS THAT ONE DAY THE OLD WOMAN VENTURED TO SAY TO THEM I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS WORSE
OF THEIR PRIDES OF THEIR FOLLIES AND OF THE SONNETS WHICH ONE MUST MAKE OR HAVE MADE FOR THEM
THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS A MAN OF SIXTY AND VERY RICH HE RECEIVED THE TWO TRAVELLERS WITH POLITE INDIFFERENCE WHICH PUT CANDIDE A LITTLE OUT OF COUNTENANCE BUT WAS NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO MARTIN
BROTHER OF THE DECEASED A LARGE NUMBER OF DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN WERE PRESENT INCLUDING SECRETARY SHERMAN ASSISTANT SECRETARY HAWLEY SENATORS BLAINE VORHEES PADDOCK ALLISON LOGAN
AND ALL MY FELLOWS ARE IN THE SAME CASE
TOOK PLACE AT HIS RESIDENCE IN WASHINGTON D C JUNE SECOND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE CEREMONIES WERE EXTREMELY SIMPLE CONSISTING MERELY OF VIEWING THE REMAINS BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS AND A FUNERAL ORATION BY COLONEL ROBERT G INGERSOLL
WELL SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR LEAVE YOU WILL AGREE THAT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS FOR HE IS ABOVE EVERYTHING HE POSSESSES BUT DO YOU NOT SEE ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE IS DISGUSTED WITH ALL HE POSSESSES
THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
MOST EXQUISITE YET ONE OF THE MOST SAD AND MOURNFUL SERMONS THE FUNERAL OF
FOOLS ADMIRE EVERYTHING IN AN AUTHOR OF REPUTATION FOR MY PART I READ ONLY TO PLEASE MYSELF I LIKE ONLY THAT WHICH SERVES MY PURPOSE
AND EVERY MOMENT JEWELED WITH A JOY WILL AT ITS CLOSE BECOME A TRAGEDY
THE TEARFUL IGNORANCE OF THE ONE IS JUST AS CONSOLING AS THE LEARNED AND UNMEANING WORDS OF THE OTHER
CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE WAS FATIGUED WITH HARD WORK AND CURSED HIS DESTINY PANGLOSS WAS IN DESPAIR AT NOT SHINING IN SOME GERMAN UNIVERSITY
THIS BRAVE AND TENDER MAN IN EVERY STORM OF LIFE WAS OAK AND ROCK BUT IN THE SUNSHINE HE WAS VINE AND FLOWER HE WAS THE FRIEND OF ALL HEROIC SOULS
MASTER SAID HE WE COME TO BEG YOU TO TELL WHY SO STRANGE AN ANIMAL AS MAN WAS MADE
WHILE YET IN LOVE WITH LIFE AND RAPTURED WITH THE WORLD HE PASSED TO SILENCE AND PATHETIC DUST YET AFTER ALL IT MAY BE BEST
BROKEN ONLY BY THE MOTHER'S SOBS UNTIL THE UNDERTAKER ADVANCED TOWARD A STOUT FLORID COMPLEXIONED GENTLEMAN IN THE PARTY AND WHISPERED TO HIM THE WORDS BEING INAUDIBLE TO THE LOOKERS ON
FROM THE WONDROUS TREE OF LIFE THE BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FALL WITH RIPENED FRUIT AND IN THE COMMON BED OF EARTH PATRIARCHS AND BABES SLEEP SIDE BY SIDE
AND ONE THOUSAND TO FRIAR GIROFLEE I'LL ANSWER FOR IT SAID HE THAT WITH THIS THEY WILL BE HAPPY I DO NOT BELIEVE IT AT ALL SAID MARTIN YOU WILL PERHAPS WITH THESE PIASTRES ONLY RENDER THEM THE MORE UNHAPPY
THE PALL BEARERS WERE SENATORS BLAINE VORHEES DAVID DAVIS PADDOCK AND ALLISON COLONEL WARD H LAMON HON JEREMIAH WILSON OF INDIANA AND HON THOMAS A BOYD OF ILLINOIS
AND YET THE BEAUTIFUL CUNEGONDE HAS NOT ARRIVED
WHISPERED WITH HIS LATEST BREATH I AM BETTER NOW LET US BELIEVE IN SPITE OF DOUBTS AND DOGMAS AND TEARS AND FEARS THAT THESE DEAR WORDS
I WISH THAT ALL THE THEATINS WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED A HUNDRED TIMES TO SET FIRE TO THE CONVENT AND GO AND BECOME A TURK
AND WHO WHILE MOSES REPRESENTS THE ETERNAL PRODUCING THE WORLD BY A WORD MAKES THE MESSIAH TAKE A GREAT PAIR OF COMPASSES FROM THE ARMOURY OF HEAVEN TO CIRCUMSCRIBE HIS WORK HOW CAN I HAVE ANY ESTEEM
THE GIRL BLUSHED THE THEATIN ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND SHE FOLLOWED HIM
COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
DIED WHERE MANHOOD'S MORNING ALMOST TOUCHES NOON AND WHILE THE SHADOWS STILL WERE FALLING TOWARD THE WEST HE HAD NOT PASSED ON LIFE'S HIGHWAY THE STONE THAT MARKS THE HIGHEST POINT
BUT I CARE LITTLE FOR HIS JOURNEY TO BRUNDUSIUM
MY INNOCENCE WOULD NOT HAVE SAVED ME IF I HAD NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING THE JUDGE SET ME FREE ON CONDITION THAT HE SUCCEEDED THE SURGEON
REPLIED THE SENATOR THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND AND NOT THREE DOZEN OF THEM GOOD FOR ANYTHING AS TO THOSE COLLECTIONS OF SERMONS WHICH ALTOGETHER ARE NOT WORTH A SINGLE PAGE OF SENECA AND THOSE HUGE VOLUMES OF THEOLOGY
THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE AND AFTER AN EXCELLENT DINNER THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
WHY SHOULD WE FEAR THAT WHICH WILL COME TO ALL THAT IS WE CANNOT TELL WE DO NOT KNOW WHICH IS THE GREATEST BLESSING LIFE OR DEATH
I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
THIS IS ONE OF THE MISERIES OF THE TRADE YESTERDAY I WAS ROBBED AND BEATEN BY AN OFFICER YET TO DAY I MUST PUT ON GOOD HUMOUR TO PLEASE A FRIAR CANDIDE WANTED NO MORE CONVINCING HE OWNED THAT MARTIN WAS IN THE RIGHT
FOR MY PART I HAVE LONG SINCE RENOUNCED THOSE PALTRY ENTERTAINMENTS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE GLORY OF MODERN ITALY AND ARE PURCHASED SO DEARLY BY SOVEREIGNS
NEITHER I NOR ANY MAN IN ITALY COULD TAKE PLEASURE IN THOSE MELANCHOLY EXTRAVAGANCES AND THE MARRIAGE OF SIN AND DEATH AND THE SNAKES BROUGHT FORTH BY SIN
THE GARDENS LAID OUT WITH TASTE WERE ADORNED WITH FINE MARBLE STATUES THE PALACE WAS BEAUTIFULLY BUILT
IF A FAMOUS SURGEON HAD NOT TAKEN COMPASSION ON ME I SHOULD HAVE DIED
THE POOR BARBARIAN WEEPING ABOVE HIS DEAD CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION AS INTELLIGENTLY AND SATISFACTORILY AS THE ROBED PRIEST OF THE MOST AUTHENTIC CREED
THOSE WHO WERE SINCERE HAVE OWNED TO ME THAT THE POEM MADE THEM FALL ASLEEP YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE IT IN THEIR LIBRARY AS A MONUMENT OF ANTIQUITY OR LIKE THOSE RUSTY MEDALS WHICH ARE NO LONGER OF USE IN COMMERCE
THERE SAID HE IS A BOOK THAT WAS ONCE THE DELIGHT OF THE GREAT PANGLOSS THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN GERMANY IT IS NOT MINE ANSWERED POCOCURANTE COOLLY
I WAS SOON SUPPLANTED BY A RIVAL TURNED OUT OF DOORS QUITE DESTITUTE AND OBLIGED TO CONTINUE THIS ABOMINABLE TRADE
AND DROPPING A FEW TEARS NO SOONER HAD SHE SET FOOT IN CANDIDE'S APARTMENT THAN SHE CRIED OUT
SOON AFTER MISTER INGERSOLL BEGAN TO READ HIS ELOQUENT CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DEAD HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS HE TRIED TO HIDE THEM BEHIND HIS EYE GLASSES
MARTIN FOUND THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF REASON IN POCOCURANTE'S REMARKS
I WISH SAID MARTIN SHE MAY ONE DAY MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY BUT I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH
I SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH THE LIBERTY WHICH INSPIRES THE ENGLISH GENIUS IF PASSION AND PARTY SPIRIT DID NOT CORRUPT ALL THAT IS ESTIMABLE IN THIS PRECIOUS LIBERTY
FOR A GOOD STRONG MOONBEAM AT LAST HE FOUND ONE THAT SEEMED RATHER SUBSTANTIAL AND REACHED RIGHT DOWN TO A PLEASANT LOOKING SPOT ON THE EARTH AND SO HE SWUNG HIMSELF OVER THE EDGE OF THE MOON
THERE WAS A CAPE TO WHICH THEY CAME THEY CRUISED ALONG THE LAND LEAVING IT ON THE STARBOARD SIDE THERE WAS A HARBOURLESS COAST LAND AND LONG SANDY STRANDS THEY WENT TO THE LAND IN BOATS AND FOUND THE KEEL OF A SHIP
FOR BY THIS TIME HE WAS VERY HUNGRY INDEED A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN ANSWERED HIS KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND HE ASKED POLITELY IS THIS THE TOWN OF NORWICH MADAM
IN THAT SPOT THERE WAS LITTLE HOWEVER TO BE GOT FOR FOOD BUT THEIR CATTLE FOUND GOOD SUSTENANCE AFTER THAT THEY CALLED UPON GOD PRAYING THAT HE WOULD SEND THEM SOME LITTLE STORE OF MEAT BUT THEIR PRAYER WAS NOT SO SOON GRANTED AS THEY WERE EAGER THAT IT SHOULD BE
COME COME NO NONSENSE SAID THE MAGISTRATE YOU MUST HAVE SOME NAME WHO ARE YOU WHY I M THE MAN IN THE MOON THAT S RUBBISH SAID THE MAGISTRATE EYEING THE PRISONER SEVERELY YOU MAY BE A MAN
AND PUT A FEW LUMPS OF ICE IN THE STOVE TO KEEP HIM WARM AND SAT DOWN TO THINK HOW HE SHOULD MANAGE THE TRIP YOU SEE EVERYTHING WENT BY CONTRARIES IN THE MOON AND WHEN THE MAN WISHED TO KEEP WARM
I WAS AWAKENED EARLY IN THE MORNING BY A WILD STORM WIND AND OF COURSE I HAD TO MAKE HASTE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY TO ENJOY IT RUGGED TORRENTS AND AVALANCHES
THAT IT WILL SEEM TO ME AN ILL THING IF IT IS HEARD THAT YOU NEVER SPENT A WORSE YULE THAN THIS JUST NOW BEGINNING WHEN EIRIK THE RED ENTERTAINED YOU AT BRATTAHLID IN GREENLAND KARLSEFNI ANSWERED IT MUST NOT COME TO SUCH A PASS
SURELY THIS IS THE TOWN OF NORWICH RETURNED THE WOMAN I CAME HERE TO SEE IF I COULD GET SOME PEASE PORRIDGE CONTINUED THE MAN
SOUTHERN SLOPES FROM PEAK TO PEAK LIKE WHITE PEARLY FOG IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT SHADOWS IN GREAT PART DETERMINE NOT ONLY THE FORMS OF LOFTY ICE MOUNTAINS
SHAKING THE WHOLE VALLEY INTO ONE HUGE SONG YET INCONCEIVABLE AS IT MUST SEEM EVEN TO THOSE WHO LOVE ALL NATURE'S WILDNESS THE STORM WAS TELLING ITS STORY ON THE MOUNTAINS
AS IF IT WERE MADE OF SILK SO RARE AND SPLENDID A PICTURE OF COURSE SMOTHERED EVERYTHING ELSE AND I AT ONCE BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE AND WALLOW UP THE SNOW CHOKED INDIAN CANYON
BUT IT WAS N'T AT ALL QUEER TO THE MAN IN THE MOON FOR HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO IT WELL HE SAT BY HIS ICE COOL FIRE AND THOUGHT ABOUT HIS JOURNEY TO THE EARTH AND FINALLY HE DECIDED THE ONLY WAY HE COULD GET THERE
CAME IN SIGHT OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE SOUTH DOME EACH WAVING A WHITE GLOWING BANNER AGAINST THE DARK BLUE SKY AS REGULAR IN FORM AND FIRM AND FINE IN TEXTURE
NOR WAS I IN THE LEAST DISAPPOINTED I REACHED THE TOP OF THE RIDGE IN FOUR OR FIVE HOURS AND THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE WOODS THE MOST IMPOSING WIND STORM EFFECT I EVER BEHELD
THE NIGHTS ARE TOO HOT WHY
BUT AFTER THIS I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT BOTH THESE SHIPS CAME TO EIRIKSFJORDR ABOUT AUTUMN EIRIK RODE DOWN TO THE SHIPS WITH OTHER MEN OF THE LAND AND A MARKET FAIR WAS PROMPTLY INSTITUTED
IF I M NOT THE MAN IN THE MOON I MUST BE THE MAN OUT OF THE MOON SO CALL ME THAT VERY GOOD REPLIED THE JUDGE NOW THEN WHERE DID YOU COME FROM THE MOON OH YOU DID EH
THEY HAD WITH THEM CATTLE OF ALL KINDS AND FOR THEMSELVES THEY SOUGHT OUT THE PRODUCE OF THE LAND THEREABOUT THERE WERE MOUNTAINS AND THE PLACE WAS FAIR TO LOOK UPON THEY GAVE NO HEED TO ANYTHING EXCEPT TO EXPLORE THE LAND AND THEY FOUND LARGE PASTURES
SCREAMED THE MAN WHY YOUR PORRIDGE IS SO HOT IT HAS BURNED ME FIDDLESTICKS SHE REPLIED THE PORRIDGE IS QUITE COLD TRY IT YOURSELF HE CRIED SO SHE TRIED IT
FOR OF COURSE AS HE WAS THE ONLY MAN IN THE MOON
WHAT HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THE STORY OF THE MAN IN THE MOON THEN I MUST SURELY TELL IT FOR IT IS VERY AMUSING AND THERE IS NOT A WORD OF TRUTH IN IT
AND THE MAN WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE TOOK A BIG SPOONFUL AT ONCE BUT NO SOONER HAD HE PUT IT INTO HIS MOUTH THAN HE UTTERED A GREAT YELL AND BEGAN DANCING FRANTICALLY ABOUT THE ROOM FOR OF COURSE
THEY REMAINED THERE DURING THE WINTER WHICH HAPPENED TO BE A HARD ONE WITH NO WORK DOING AND THEY WERE BADLY OFF FOR FOOD AND THE FISHING FAILED THEN THEY WENT OUT TO THE ISLAND HOPING THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE GOT THERE FROM FISHING OR FROM WHAT WAS DRIFTED ASHORE
EIRIK AND LEIF HAD GOT THESE PEOPLE TO GO WITH KARLSEFNI NOW WHEN THEY HAD SAILED BY FURDUSTRANDIR THEY PUT THE SCOTCH PEOPLE ON LAND AND REQUESTED THEM TO RUN INTO THE SOUTHERN REGIONS SEEK FOR CHOICE LAND
WE FIND THAT THE MAIN CAUSES OF THE WONDROUS BEAUTY AND PERFECTION OF THOSE WE ARE LOOKING AT ARE THE FAVORABLE DIRECTION AND FORCE OF THE WIND THE ABUNDANCE OF SNOW DUST AND THE FORM OF THE NORTH SIDES OF THE PEAKS
BUT YOU FEEL NOTHING OF ITS VIOLENCE FOR YOU ARE LOOKING OUT THROUGH A SHELTERED OPENING IN THE WOODS AS THROUGH A WINDOW IN THE IMMEDIATE FOREGROUND THERE IS A FOREST OF SILVER FIR
OVERBEARING IN TEMPER OF MELANCHOLY MOOD SILENT AT ALL TIMES UNDERHAND IN HIS DEALINGS AND WITHAL GIVEN TO ABUSE AND ALWAYS INCLINED TOWARDS THE WORST HE HAD KEPT HIMSELF ALOOF FROM THE TRUE FAITH WHEN IT CAME TO GREENLAND
WHICH BELONGS TO THE CIRCUS THAT CAME HERE LAST SUMMER AND WAS PAWNED FOR A BOARD BILL WE CAN INFLATE THIS BALLOON AND SEND THE MAN OUT OF THE MOON HOME IN IT
AND THEN HE SAILED OUT OF SIGHT AND LEFT THE MAN IN THE MOON TO REFLECT UPON WHAT HE HAD SAID THE WORDS OF THE ALDERMAN MADE HIM MORE ANXIOUS THAN EVER TO VISIT THE EARTH AND SO HE WALKED THOUGHTFULLY HOME
HE LOOKED DOWN AND SAW AN ALDERMAN SAILING UP THROUGH THE AIR TOWARDS HIM THIS ALDERMAN WAS BEING TRANSLATED INSTEAD OF BEING TRANSPORTED OWING TO A MISPRINT IN THE LAW AND AS HE CAME NEAR
THE MERCHANTS ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND WENT HOME WITH EIRIK AFTERWARDS THEIR MERCHANDISE WAS REMOVED TO BRATTAHLID WHERE A GOOD AND LARGE OUTHOUSE WAS NOT LACKING IN WHICH TO STORE THE GOODS THE MERCHANTS WERE WELL PLEASED
AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO DO NEXT I D LIKE TO GET BACK TO THE MOON SAID THE MAN
THE PEAKS ALONG THE AXIS OF THE RANGE ARE THEN DECORATED WITH RESPLENDENT BANNERS SOME OF THEM MORE THAN A MILE LONG SHINING STREAMING WAVING WITH SOLEMN EXUBERANT ENTHUSIASM
SO AS IT WAS NOW NIGHT HE FETCHED HIS TELESCOPE AND LOOKED AT THE MOON AND FOUND THERE WAS NO MAN IN IT AT ALL IT SEEMS TO BE TRUE SAID THE ASTRONOMER THAT THE MAN HAS GOT OUT OF THE MOON SOMEHOW OR OTHER
THORHALL DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT AND THEY WENT TO SEEK HIM AND SOUGHT FOR THREE HALF DAYS CONTINUOUSLY ON THE FOURTH HALF DAY KARLSEFNI AND BJARNI FOUND HIM ON THE PEAK OF A CRAG HE LAY WITH HIS FACE TO THE SKY
THERE WERE SO MANY BIRDS ON IT THAT SCARCELY WAS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT ONE'S FEET DOWN FOR THE EGGS THEY CONTINUED THEIR COURSE UP THE FIRTH WHICH THEY CALLED STRAUMSFJORDR AND CARRIED THEIR CARGO ASHORE FROM THE SHIPS AND THERE THEY PREPARED TO STAY
INTERFERING CLOUDY DRIFTS WOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED FOR THE SNOW INSTEAD OF BEING SPOUTED STRAIGHT UP AND OVER THE TOPS OF THE PEAKS IN CONDENSED CURRENTS TO BE DRAWN OUT AS STREAMERS WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OVER THE CONVEX
AND FOUND IT VERY COLD AND PLEASANT BUT THE MAN WAS SO ASTONISHED TO SEE HER EAT THE PORRIDGE THAT HAD BLISTERED HIS OWN MOUTH THAT HE BECAME FRIGHTENED AND RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND DOWN THE STREET AS FAST AS HE COULD GO
FASTER AND FASTER SO THAT JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE EARTH HE LOST HIS HOLD AND CAME TUMBLING DOWN HEAD OVER HEELS AND FELL PLUMP INTO A RIVER THE COOL WATER
AND THERE WERE THIRTY MEN IN THE COMPANY THERE WAS A MAN NAMED BJARNI GRIMOLF'S SON
NEARLY SCALDED HIM BEFORE HE COULD SWIM OUT BUT FORTUNATELY HE WAS NEAR THE BANK AND HE QUICKLY SCRAMBLED UPON THE LAND AND SAT DOWN TO CATCH HIS BREATH BY THAT TIME IT WAS MORNING AND AS THE SUN ROSE
HE WAS BUT LITTLE ENCOMPASSED WITH THE LOVE OF FRIENDS BUT YET EIRIK HAD LONG HELD CONVERSATION WITH HIM HE WENT IN THE SHIP WITH THORVALD AND HIS MAN BECAUSE HE WAS WIDELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE UNPEOPLED DISTRICTS THEY HAD THE SHIP WHICH THORBJORN HAD BROUGHT TO GREENLAND
THANK YOU SAID THE MAN IN THE MOON BUT STOP I MUST NOT CALL HIM THE MAN IN THE MOON ANY LONGER FOR OF COURSE HE WAS NOW OUT OF THE MOON SO I LL SIMPLY CALL HIM THE MAN AND YOU LL KNOW BY THAT WHICH MAN I MEAN
IN GENERAL THE NORTH SIDES ARE CONCAVE IN BOTH THEIR HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SECTIONS HAVING BEEN SCULPTURED INTO THIS SHAPE BY THE RESIDUAL GLACIERS
THEN WAS PREPARATION MADE FOR THE YULE FEAST AND SO MAGNIFICENT WAS IT THAT THE MEN THOUGHT THEY HAD SCARCELY EVER SEEN SO GRAND A FEAST AND AFTER YULE KARLSEFNI BROACHED TO EIRIK THE SUBJECT OF A MARRIAGE WITH GUDRID
I LL TELL YOU WHAT WE CAN DO REMARKED THE ASTRONOMER
FIND THIS SNOW DUST IN A LOOSE CONDITION ON THE SLOPES ABOVE THE TIMBER LINE
AND WHAT WAS COLD HERE WAS HOT THERE SO HE BEGAN TO THINK THE MAN HAD TOLD THE TRUTH THEREFORE HE BEGGED THE MAGISTRATE TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES WHILE HE LOOKED THROUGH HIS TELESCOPE TO SEE IF THE MAN IN THE MOON WAS THERE
WITH NOTHING TO BLUR THE SUBLIME PICTURE THEY MADE FANCY YOURSELF STANDING BESIDE ME ON THIS YOSEMITE RIDGE THERE IS A STRANGE GARISH GLITTER IN THE AIR AND THE GALE DRIVES WILDLY OVERHEAD
AND PUT BOTH ARMS TIGHT AROUND THE MOONBEAM AND STARTED TO SLIDE DOWN BUT HE FOUND IT RATHER SLIPPERY AND IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EFFORTS TO HOLD ON HE FOUND HIMSELF GOING
AND NOW AFTER THIS GENERAL VIEW MARK HOW SHARPLY THE RIBS AND BUTTRESSES AND SUMMITS OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE DEFINED EXCEPTING THE PORTIONS VEILED BY THE BANNERS
ITS HOT RAYS COOLED HIM OFF SOMEWHAT SO THAT HE BEGAN LOOKING ABOUT CURIOUSLY AT ALL THE STRANGE SIGHTS AND WONDERING WHERE ON EARTH HE WAS BY AND BY A FARMER CAME ALONG THE ROAD BY THE RIVER
WHILE THUS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR A SMALL PORTION ESCAPES FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SKY AS VAPOR BUT FAR THE GREATER PART IS AT LENGTH LOCKED FAST IN BOSSY OVERCURLING CORNICES ALONG THE RIDGES
THE PORRIDGE THAT WAS COLD TO EARTH FOLK WAS HOT TO HIM AND THE BIG SPOONFUL OF COLD PEASE PORRIDGE HAD BURNED HIS MOUTH TO A BLISTER WHAT S THE MATTER ASKED THE WOMAN MATTER
IS PREPARED FOR THE GRAND BANNER WAVING CELEBRATIONS BY THE ACTION OF THE WIND INSTEAD OF AT ONCE FINDING REST LIKE THAT WHICH FALLS INTO THE TRANQUIL DEPTHS OF THE FOREST IT IS SHOVED
IN STILL GRANDER CHARACTERS A WONDERFUL WINTER SCENE I HAD LONG BEEN ANXIOUS TO STUDY SOME POINTS IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE ICE HILL AT THE FOOT OF THE UPPER YOSEMITE FALL
DURING THE FIVE WINTERS THAT I SPENT IN YOSEMITE I MADE MANY EXCURSIONS TO HIGH POINTS ABOVE THE WALLS IN ALL KINDS OF WEATHER TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE FROM ALL MY LOFTY OUTLOOKS
THE MAN IN THE MOON
DURING THIS TIME MUCH TALK TOOK PLACE IN BRATTAHLID ABOUT MAKING READY TO GO TO VINLAND THE GOOD AND IT WAS ASSERTED
TO THE SEA BUT THOUGH SNOW DUST AND STORM WINDS ABOUND ON THE MOUNTAINS REGULAR SHAPELY BANNERS ARE FOR CAUSES WE SHALL PRESENTLY SEE SELDOM PRODUCED
THEN BEGAN THORHALL AND SAID HAS IT NOT BEEN THAT THE REDBEARD HAS PROVED A BETTER FRIEND THAN YOUR CHRIST THIS WAS MY GIFT FOR THE POETRY WHICH I COMPOSED ABOUT THOR MY PATRON SELDOM HAS HE FAILED ME
THE MAN IN THE MOON WAS RATHER LONESOME AND OFTEN HE PEEKED OVER THE EDGE OF THE MOON AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE EARTH AND ENVIED ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED TOGETHER FOR HE THOUGHT
TO A RIDGE ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND FEET HIGH COMMANDING A GENERAL VIEW OF THE MAIN SUMMITS ALONG THE AXIS OF THE RANGE FEELING ASSURED I SHOULD FIND THEM BANNERED STILL MORE GLORIOUSLY
FROM WHENCE THEY LOOKED A GOOD DEAL SMALLER BUT HE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND SAID TO THE FARMER CAN YOU TELL ME THE WAY TO NORWICH SIR NORWICH REPEATED THE FARMER MUSINGLY
AND CALLED THE ISLAND BJARNEY BEAR ISLAND BUT THE MAINLAND WHERE THE FOREST WAS THEY CALLED MARKLAND FOREST LAND THEN WHEN TWO HALF DAYS WERE PASSED THEY SAW LAND AND SAILED UNDER IT
THEY WERE DRESSED IN SUCH WISE THAT THEY HAD ON THE GARMENT WHICH THEY CALLED BIAFAL IT WAS MADE WITH A HOOD AT THE TOP OPEN AT THE SIDES WITHOUT SLEEVES AND WAS FASTENED BETWEEN THE LEGS A BUTTON AND A LOOP HELD IT TOGETHER THERE
THERE WAS A MAN NAMED THORFINN KARLSEFNI SON OF THORD HORSEHEAD WHO DWELT IN THE NORTH OF ICELAND AT REYNINES IN SKAGAFJORDR AS IT IS NOW CALLED
AND TRANSLUCENT TOWARD THE END SO THAT THE PARTS OF THE PEAKS PAST WHICH THEY ARE STREAMING LOOK DIM AS IF SEEN THROUGH A VEIL OF GROUND GLASS AND SEE HOW SOME OF THE LONGEST OF THE BANNERS
BECAUSE IT WAS TEDIOUS TO SAIL BY THEM THEN THE COAST BECAME INDENTED WITH CREEKS AND THEY DIRECTED THEIR SHIPS ALONG THE CREEKS NOW BEFORE THIS WHEN LEIF WAS WITH KING OLAF TRYGGVASON AND THE KING HAD REQUESTED HIM TO PREACH CHRISTIANITY IN GREENLAND
HOW BRIGHT AND GLOWING WHITE THEY ARE AND HOW FINELY THEIR FADING FRINGES ARE PENCILED ON THE SKY SEE HOW SOLID WHITE AND OPAQUE THEY ARE AT THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT AND HOW FILMY
CAME FULL IN SIGHT UNNUMBERED MOUNTAINS RISING SHARPLY INTO THE CLOUDLESS SKY THEIR BASES SOLID WHITE THEIR SIDES PLASHED WITH SNOW LIKE OCEAN ROCKS WITH FOAM
YOU RE IN NORWICH THAT IS TRUE ANSWERED THE MAN WHO WAS QUITE BEWILDERED BY THIS IDEA AND OF COURSE YOU MUST BE CALLED SOMETHING CONTINUED THE MAGISTRATE WELL THEN SAID THE PRISONER
IT MUST BE VASTLY MORE PLEASANT TO HAVE COMPANIONS TO TALK TO THAN TO BE SHUT UP IN A BIG PLANET ALL BY HIMSELF WHERE HE HAD TO WHISTLE TO KEEP HIMSELF COMPANY ONE DAY
SOME OF THE FAMOUS PEASE PORRIDGE THAT WAS MADE THERE AND FINALLY AFTER A LONG AND TIRESOME JOURNEY HE REACHED THE TOWN AND STOPPED AT ONE OF THE FIRST HOUSES HE CAME TO
WITH BOTH EYES AND MOUTH AND NOSTRILS WIDE OPEN CLAWING AND PINCHING HIMSELF AND RECITING SOMETHING THEY ASKED WHY HE HAD COME THERE HE REPLIED THAT IT WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE BEGGED THEM NOT TO WONDER THEREAT
FROM THE MAIN WIND FLOOD OVERHEAD WERE ROARING DOWN THE SIDE CANYONS AND OVER THE CLIFFS AROUSING THE ROCKS AND THE TREES AND THE STREAMS ALIKE INTO GLORIOUS HURRAHING ENTHUSIASM
AS IF CELEBRATING SOME SURPASSINGLY GLORIOUS EVENT THE SNOW OF WHICH THESE BANNERS ARE MADE FALLS ON THE HIGH SIERRA IN MOST EXTRAVAGANT ABUNDANCE SOMETIMES TO A DEPTH OF FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FEET
AND SWEEP IT ONWARD FROM PEAK TO PEAK IN THE FORM OF SMOOTH REGULAR BANNERS OR IN CLOUDY DRIFTS ACCORDING TO THE VELOCITY AND DIRECTION OF THE WIND AND THE CONFORMATION OF THE SLOPES OVER WHICH IT IS DRIVEN
THE MAN IN THE MOON CALLED TO HIM AND SAID HOW IS EVERYTHING DOWN ON THE EARTH EVERYTHING IS LOVELY REPLIED THE ALDERMAN AND I WOULD N'T LEAVE IT IF I WAS NOT OBLIGED TO
KARLSEFNI PREPARED HIS SHIP INTENDING TO GO TO GREENLAND SNORRI THORBRAND'S SON FROM ALPTAFJORDR
SO THE BALLOON WAS BROUGHT AND INFLATED AND THE MAN GOT INTO THE BASKET AND GAVE THE WORD TO LET GO AND THEN THE BALLOON MOUNTED UP INTO THE SKY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MOON THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NORWICH STOOD ON THE EARTH
THE POLICEMAN ON THE FIRST CORNER SAW HIM RUNNING AND PROMPTLY ARRESTED HIM AND HE WAS MARCHED OFF TO THE MAGISTRATE FOR TRIAL WHAT IS YOUR NAME ASKED THE MAGISTRATE I HAVE N'T ANY REPLIED THE MAN
WHAT S A GOOD PLACE TO VISIT DOWN THERE ENQUIRED THE MAN IN THE MOON OH NORWICH IS A MIGHTY FINE PLACE RETURNED THE ALDERMAN
THEY ARE TWENTY MILES AWAY BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH THEM NEARER FOR EVERY FEATURE IS DISTINCT AND THE WHOLE WONDERFUL SHOW IS SEEN IN ITS RIGHT PROPORTIONS LIKE A PAINTING ON THE SKY
THEN THEY SAILED WITH NORTHERLY WINDS TWO HALF DAYS AND THERE WAS THEN LAND BEFORE THEM AND ON IT A GREAT FOREST AND MANY WILD BEASTS AN ISLAND LAY IN THE SOUTH EAST OFF THE LAND AND THEY FOUND BEARS THEREON
AND BLOWN HORIZONTALLY ALONG THE FACE OF THE CLIFF LEAVING THE ICE HILL DRY AND WHILE MAKING MY WAY TO THE TOP OF FERN LEDGE TO SEIZE SO FAVORABLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK DOWN ITS THROAT
AND ON EVERY SUMMIT A MAGNIFICENT SILVERY BANNER FROM TWO THOUSAND TO SIX THOUSAND FEET IN LENGTH SLENDER AT THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT AND WIDENING GRADUALLY UNTIL ABOUT A THOUSAND
I SAW ONLY ONE BANNER STORM THAT SEEMED IN EVERY WAY PERFECT THIS WAS IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE WHEN THE SNOW LADEN PEAKS WERE SWEPT BY A POWERFUL NORTHER
WELL THE MAN IN THE I MEAN THE MAN
TO STAY WITH EIRIK DURING THE WINTER WHEN NOW YULE WAS DRAWING NIGH EIRIK BEGAN TO LOOK MORE GLOOMY THAN HE WAS WONT TO BE PRESENTLY KARLSEFNI ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM AND SAID ART THOU IN TROUBLE EIRIK
IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THOU ART SOMEWHAT MORE TACITURN THAN THOU HAST BEEN STILL THOU HELPEST US WITH MUCH LIBERALITY
THE MAGISTRATE LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT IN SURPRISE AND THEN HE SAID THIS PERSON IS EVIDENTLY CRAZY SO TAKE HIM TO THE LUNATIC ASYLUM AND KEEP HIM THERE
THE TWO SHIPS LAUNCHED OUT INTO THE OPEN SEA AS SOON AS THEY WERE READY IT IS NOT RECORDED
HOW DID YOU GET HERE I SLID DOWN A MOONBEAM INDEED WELL WHAT WERE YOU RUNNING FOR A WOMAN GAVE ME SOME COLD PEASE PORRIDGE AND IT BURNED MY MOUTH
LET ME LOOK AT YOUR MOUTH SIR AND SEE IF IT IS REALLY BURNED THEN THE MAN OPENED HIS MOUTH AND EVERYONE SAW PLAINLY IT WAS BURNED TO A BLISTER THEREUPON THE MAGISTRATE BEGGED HIS PARDON FOR DOUBTING HIS WORD
ON THE HIGHEST PEAKS ARE STREAMING PERFECTLY FREE FROM PEAK TO PEAK ACROSS INTERVENING NOTCHES OR PASSES WHILE OTHERS OVERLAP AND PARTLY HIDE ONE ANOTHER AS TO THEIR FORMATION
OR FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET IN BREADTH AND AS SHAPELY AND AS SUBSTANTIAL LOOKING IN TEXTURE AS THE BANNERS OF THE FINEST SILK ALL STREAMING AND WAVING FREE AND CLEAR IN THE SUN GLOW
AND CUT IT UP AND STILL THEY KNEW NOT WHAT KIND OF WHALE IT WAS EVEN KARLSEFNI RECOGNISED IT NOT THOUGH HE HAD GREAT KNOWLEDGE OF WHALES IT WAS COOKED BY THE COOK BOYS AND THEY ATE THEREOF THOUGH BAD EFFECTS CAME UPON ALL FROM IT AFTERWARDS
WILL YOU HAVE IT HOT OR COLD SIR OH COLD BY ALL MEANS REPLIED THE MAN FOR I DETEST ANYTHING HOT TO EAT SHE SOON BROUGHT HIM A BOWL OF COLD PEASE PORRIDGE
HE HAD FOR A LONG TIME BEEN EIRIK'S COMPANION IN HUNTING AND FISHING EXPEDITIONS DURING THE SUMMERS AND MANY THINGS HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO HIS KEEPING THORHALL WAS A BIG MAN DARK AND OF GAUNT APPEARANCE RATHER ADVANCED IN YEARS
AND TIPPED BACK THEIR HEADS AND WATCHED THE BALLOON GO HIGHER AND HIGHER UNTIL FINALLY THE MAN REACHED OUT AND CAUGHT HOLD OF THE EDGE OF THE MOON AND BEHOLD THE NEXT MINUTE HE WAS THE MAN IN THE MOON AGAIN
HE KNOCKED OFF A FEW CHUNKS OF ICE AND PUT THEM IN HIS STOVE AND HE COOLED HIS DRINKING WATER BY THROWING RED HOT COALS OF FIRE INTO THE PITCHER LIKEWISE WHEN HE BECAME CHILLY
NOW WHEN THE MEN KNEW THAT NONE OF THEM WOULD EAT OF IT AND THEY THREW IT DOWN FROM THE ROCKS AND TURNED WITH THEIR SUPPLICATIONS TO GOD'S MERCY THEN WAS GRANTED TO THEM OPPORTUNITY OF FISHING AND AFTER THAT THERE WAS NO LACK OF FOOD THAT SPRING
OR IN STRATIFIED SHEETS IN THE GLACIER CIRQUES SOME OF IT TO REPLENISH THE SMALL RESIDUAL GLACIERS AND REMAIN SILENT AND RIGID FOR CENTURIES BEFORE IT IS FINALLY MELTED AND SENT SINGING DOWN HOME
KARLSEFNI WAS A MAN OF GOOD FAMILY AND VERY RICH HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS THORUN HE ENGAGED IN TRADING JOURNEYS AND SEEMED A GOODLY BOLD AND GALLANT TRAVELLER ONE SUMMER
WITH A TEAM OF HORSES DRAWING A LOAD OF HAY AND THE HORSES LOOKED SO ODD TO THE MAN IN THE MOON THAT AT FIRST HE WAS GREATLY FRIGHTENED NEVER BEFORE HAVING SEEN HORSES EXCEPT FROM HIS HOME IN THE MOON
MANY AND SO GREAT THAT TWO MEN MIGHT WELL LIE ON THEM STRETCHED ON THEIR BACKS WITH HEEL TO HEEL POLAR FOXES WERE THERE IN ABUNDANCE THIS LAND THEY GAVE NAME TO AND CALLED IT HELLULAND
WE HAVE IN OUR SHIPS MALT MEAL AND CORN AND YOU HAVE RIGHT AND TITLE TO TAKE THEREFROM WHATEVER YOU WISH AND TO MAKE YOUR ENTERTAINMENT SUCH AS CONSORTS WITH YOUR MUNIFICENCE AND EIRIK ACCEPTED THE OFFER
I WAS PERHAPS A DOZEN SECONDS COLLECTING MYSELF THEN CRIED I SALUTE BOW DOWN HIS TEETH FLASHED UPON ME IN A SNARL WHO ARE YOU THAT I SHOULD
AND THERE I SAT CHIN ON KNEES THE SUN BEATING DOWN UPON MY HEAD AND UNSPEAKABLE DREAD IN MY MIND PLOTTING HOW I COULD LIVE ON AGAINST THE HOUR OF MY RESCUE IF EVER RESCUE CAME
I TALKED NOW WITHOUT THE CATCHING IN MY BREATH DUE TO THE INTENSITY OF MY EXCITEMENT THAT HAD TROUBLED ME AT FIRST IN THE COURSE OF ABOUT AN HOUR I HAD REALLY CONVINCED SEVERAL OF THE BEAST FOLK OF THE TRUTH OF MY ASSERTIONS AND TALKED MOST OF THE OTHERS INTO A DUBIOUS STATE
AND FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER RETIRED TOWARDS THE DENS IN THE RAVINE AND I DREADING THE SILENCE AND DARKNESS WENT WITH THEM KNOWING I WAS SAFER WITH SEVERAL OF THEM THAN WITH ONE ALONE IN THIS MANNER BEGAN THE LONGER PART OF MY SOJOURN UPON THIS ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU
THE TRADITION OF THE LAW WAS CLEARLY LOSING ITS FORCE I CANNOT PURSUE THIS DISAGREEABLE SUBJECT MY DOG MAN IMPERCEPTIBLY SLIPPED BACK TO THE DOG AGAIN DAY BY DAY HE BECAME DUMB QUADRUPEDAL HAIRY
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WAS AT THE ROOT OF THE BRUTE'S ATTACHMENT TO ME IT WAS SOON EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE FORMER MONSTER HAD TASTED BLOOD AND GONE THE WAY OF THE LEOPARD MAN
ALTOGETHER PERHAPS TWENTY OF THE BEAST FOLK SQUATTED STARING INTO THE FIRE OR TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER HE IS DEAD HE IS DEAD THE MASTER IS DEAD SAID THE VOICE OF THE APE MAN TO THE RIGHT OF ME
IN THE AFTERNOON THE TIDE STRANDED THE BOAT AND LEFT IT A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO TO THE WESTWARD OF THE RUINS OF THE ENCLOSURE THE MEN IN IT WERE DEAD HAD BEEN DEAD SO LONG THAT THEY FELL TO PIECES WHEN I TILTED THE BOAT ON ITS SIDE AND DRAGGED THEM OUT
NO GO AWAY I INSISTED AND SNAPPED MY WHIP
FOR A MOMENT THE OPENING OF THE HUT WAS BLACKENED BY THE EXIT OF THE DOG MAN THEN I FOLLOWED AND STOOD UP ALMOST IN THE EXACT SPOT WHERE I HAD BEEN WHEN I HAD HEARD MOREAU AND HIS STAGHOUND PURSUING ME
I SPENT MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT GRUBBING AMONG THE BLACK RUINS OF THE ENCLOSURE AND ON THE BEACH WHERE THE BOATS HAD BEEN BURNT LOOKING FOR NAILS AND OTHER STRAY PIECES OF METAL THAT MIGHT PROVE OF SERVICE
I SCARCELY NOTICED THE TRANSITION FROM THE COMPANION ON MY RIGHT HAND TO THE LURCHING DOG AT MY SIDE AS THE CARELESSNESS AND DISORGANISATION INCREASED FROM DAY TO DAY THE LANE OF DWELLING PLACES AT NO TIME VERY SWEET BECAME SO LOATHSOME THAT I LEFT IT
BUT THEY DO NOT HELP THE TELLING OF THE STORY
THE BEAST PEOPLE BY THAT TIME HAD WITH ONE OR TWO EXCEPTIONS LEFT THE RAVINE AND MADE THEMSELVES LAIRS ACCORDING TO THEIR TASTE AMONG THE THICKETS OF THE ISLAND FEW PROWLED BY DAY MOST OF THEM SLEPT AND THE ISLAND MIGHT HAVE SEEMED DESERTED TO A NEW COMER
FOR THEM AND FOR ME IT CAME WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE SHOCK I STILL WENT AMONG THEM IN SAFETY BECAUSE NO JOLT IN THE DOWNWARD GLIDE HAD RELEASED THE INCREASING CHARGE OF EXPLOSIVE ANIMALISM THAT OUSTED THE HUMAN DAY BY DAY BUT I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT SOON NOW THAT SHOCK MUST COME
MADE EVERY FOREST PATHWAY DANGEROUS TO ME AND MY ALLY WITH HIS LURKING AMBUSCADES
MONTGOMERY ALMOST STAGGERED INTO HIM AND THEN STOPPED TOO THEN LISTENING INTENTLY WE HEARD COMING THROUGH THE TREES THE SOUND OF VOICES AND FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING US HE IS DEAD SAID A DEEP VIBRATING VOICE
HE IS NOT DEAD SAID I IN A LOUD VOICE EVEN NOW HE WATCHES US THIS STARTLED THEM TWENTY PAIRS OF EYES REGARDED ME THE HOUSE OF PAIN IS GONE SAID I IT WILL COME AGAIN
I KEPT A SHARP EYE FOR MY ENEMY THE HYENA SWINE BUT HE NEVER APPEARED EVERY NOW AND THEN A SUSPICIOUS MOVEMENT WOULD STARTLE ME BUT MY CONFIDENCE GREW RAPIDLY THEN AS THE MOON CREPT DOWN FROM THE ZENITH ONE BY ONE THE LISTENERS BEGAN TO YAWN
MY THOUGHTS WERE DISTURBED BY A CRYING OF SEA BIRDS HURRYING TOWARDS SOME BLACK OBJECT THAT HAD BEEN STRANDED BY THE WAVES ON THE BEACH NEAR THE ENCLOSURE I KNEW WHAT THAT OBJECT WAS BUT I HAD NOT THE HEART TO GO BACK AND DRIVE THEM OFF
HE STOPPED IN THIS CROUCHING ATTITUDE WHEN I TURNED HIS EYES A LITTLE AVERTED FOR A MOMENT WE STOOD EYE TO EYE
EVERY NOW AND THEN HE LOOKED BACK AT ME OVER HIS SHOULDER HE WENT SLANTING ALONG THE BEACH AND VANISHED BENEATH THE DRIVING MASSES OF DENSE SMOKE THAT WERE STILL POURING OUT FROM THE BURNING ENCLOSURE FOR SOME TIME I STOOD STARING AFTER HIM
I USED TO GO MOPING ABOUT THE ISLAND TRYING WITH ALL MY MIGHT TO SOLVE THIS ONE LAST DIFFICULTY SOMETIMES I WOULD GIVE WAY TO WILD OUTBURSTS OF RAGE AND HACK AND SPLINTER SOME UNLUCKY TREE IN MY INTOLERABLE VEXATION BUT I COULD THINK OF NOTHING
AS I APPROACHED THE MONSTER LIFTED ITS GLARING EYES TO MINE ITS LIPS WENT TREMBLING BACK FROM ITS RED STAINED TEETH AND IT GROWLED MENACINGLY IT WAS NOT AFRAID AND NOT ASHAMED THE LAST VESTIGE OF THE HUMAN TAINT HAD VANISHED
IN THIS WAY I BECAME ONE AMONG THE BEAST PEOPLE IN THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU WHEN I AWOKE IT WAS DARK ABOUT ME MY ARM ACHED IN ITS BANDAGES I SAT UP WONDERING AT FIRST WHERE I MIGHT BE I HEARD COARSE VOICES TALKING OUTSIDE
ONCE I TRIED TO INDUCE THE BEAST FOLK TO HUNT HIM BUT I LACKED THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THEM CO OPERATE FOR ONE END AGAIN AND AGAIN I TRIED TO APPROACH HIS DEN AND COME UPON HIM UNAWARE BUT ALWAYS HE WAS TOO ACUTE FOR ME AND SAW OR WINDED ME AND GOT AWAY HE TOO
SLOWLY SLOWLY THE BOAT DROVE PAST TOWARDS THE WEST
IT WAS ABOUT MAY WHEN I FIRST DISTINCTLY PERCEIVED A GROWING DIFFERENCE IN THEIR SPEECH AND CARRIAGE A GROWING COARSENESS OF ARTICULATION A GROWING DISINCLINATION TO TALK
AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HOUSE OF PAIN HAD AFFECTED THEM I KNOW NOW THE FOLLY OF MY COWARDICE
ITS SPRING CARRIED IT OVER ME I FELL UNDER THE HIND PART OF ITS BODY BUT LUCKILY I HAD HIT AS I MEANT AND IT HAD DIED EVEN AS IT LEAPT
HE HESITATED AS HE APPROACHED GO AWAY CRIED I
AMONG THE CHIPS SCATTERED ABOUT THE BEACH LAY THE TWO AXES THAT HAD BEEN USED TO CHOP UP THE BOATS THE TIDE WAS CREEPING IN BEHIND ME THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT COURAGE I LOOKED SQUARELY INTO THE FACES OF THE ADVANCING MONSTERS
I TURNED MY BACK UPON THEM STRUCK THE LUG AND BEGAN PADDLING OUT TO SEA I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO LOOK BEHIND ME
HE HAS CHANGED HIS SHAPE HE HAS CHANGED HIS BODY I WENT ON FOR A TIME YOU WILL NOT SEE HIM HE IS THERE I POINTED UPWARD WHERE HE CAN WATCH YOU YOU CANNOT SEE HIM BUT HE CAN SEE YOU FEAR THE LAW
HE WAS ALREADY MORE THAN HALF FUDDLED I TOLD HIM THAT SOME SERIOUS THING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO MOREAU BY THIS TIME OR HE WOULD HAVE RETURNED BEFORE THIS AND THAT IT BEHOVED US TO ASCERTAIN WHAT THAT CATASTROPHE WAS MONTGOMERY RAISED SOME FEEBLE OBJECTIONS AND AT LAST AGREED
THERE WAS A SILENCE THEN A CRASHING AMONG THE INTERLACING VEGETATION FIRST HERE THEN THERE AND THEN HALF A DOZEN FACES APPEARED STRANGE FACES LIT BY A STRANGE LIGHT
HE IS DEAD SAID THIS MONSTER THEY SAW THERE WAS NOTHING THREATENING ABOUT THIS DETACHMENT AT ANY RATE
DURING THAT TIME THEY RESPECTED THE USAGE ESTABLISHED BY THE LAW AND BEHAVED WITH GENERAL DECORUM ONCE I FOUND ANOTHER RABBIT TORN TO PIECES BY THE HYENA SWINE I AM ASSURED BUT THAT WAS ALL
TAKING LITTLE HEED OF THE DIM THINGS THAT PEERED AT US OUT OF THE HUTS NONE ABOUT THE FIRE ATTEMPTED TO SALUTE ME MOST OF THEM DISREGARDED ME OSTENTATIOUSLY I LOOKED ROUND FOR THE HYENA SWINE BUT HE WAS NOT THERE
THE EXHAUSTION OF THE LAST THIRTY HOURS CLAIMED ITS OWN AND I FELL INTO A LIGHT SLUMBER
THAT DANGER AT LEAST WAS OVER BUT THIS I KNEW WAS ONLY THE FIRST OF THE SERIES OF RELAPSES THAT MUST COME I BURNT BOTH OF THE BODIES ON A PYRE OF BRUSHWOOD BUT AFTER THAT I SAW THAT UNLESS I LEFT THE ISLAND MY DEATH WAS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME
THE THING THAT BLED AND RAN SCREAMING AND SOBBING THAT IS DEAD TOO SAID THE GREY THING STILL REGARDING ME THAT'S WELL GRUNTED MONTGOMERY THE OTHER WITH THE WHIP BEGAN THE GREY THING WELL SAID I
BUT STILL MORE AFRAID OF MY CRACKING RED WHIP LASH AND AFTER SOME FUMBLING AND HESITATION SOME WHIP CRACKING AND SHOUTING THEY LIFTED HIM GINGERLY CARRIED HIM DOWN TO THE BEACH AND WENT SPLASHING INTO THE DAZZLING WELTER OF THE SEA ON SAID I
ONE OF MY SPASMS OF DISGUST CAME UPON ME I THRUST THE LITTLE BOAT DOWN THE BEACH AND CLAMBERED ON BOARD HER
I ADVANCED A STEP FARTHER STOPPED AND PULLED OUT MY REVOLVER AT LAST I HAD HIM FACE TO FACE THE BRUTE MADE NO SIGN OF RETREAT BUT ITS EARS WENT BACK ITS HAIR BRISTLED AND ITS BODY CROUCHED TOGETHER I AIMED BETWEEN THE EYES AND FIRED
HIS REVOLVER WE COULD NOT FIND MONTGOMERY TURNED HIM OVER RESTING AT INTERVALS AND WITH THE HELP OF THE SEVEN BEAST PEOPLE FOR HE WAS A HEAVY MAN WE CARRIED MOREAU BACK TO THE ENCLOSURE THE NIGHT WAS DARKLING
THOUGH THEY EVIDENTLY FELT ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES EVERY NOW AND THEN I WOULD COME UPON ONE OR ANOTHER RUNNING ON TOES AND FINGER TIPS AND QUITE UNABLE TO RECOVER THE VERTICAL ATTITUDE THEY HELD THINGS MORE CLUMSILY DRINKING BY SUCTION FEEDING BY GNAWING GREW COMMONER EVERY DAY
IMMEDIATELY AFTER APPEARED A MONSTER IN HEADLONG PURSUIT BLOOD BEDABBLED
I HEARD A LIGHT FOOTFALL BEHIND ME AND TURNING QUICKLY SAW THE BIG HYENA SWINE PERHAPS A DOZEN YARDS AWAY HIS HEAD WAS BENT DOWN HIS BRIGHT EYES WERE FIXED UPON ME HIS STUMPY HANDS CLENCHED AND HELD CLOSE BY HIS SIDE
IN THE DAWN THE SAIL WAS NEARER AND I SAW IT WAS THE DIRTY LUG SAIL OF A SMALL BOAT BUT IT SAILED STRANGELY MY EYES WERE WEARY WITH WATCHING AND I PEERED AND COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM TWO MEN WERE IN THE BOAT SITTING LOW DOWN ONE BY THE BOWS THE OTHER AT THE RUDDER
BORE ME A GRUDGE BUT IT VENTED ITSELF CHIEFLY BEHIND MY BACK AND AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM MY MISSILES IN GRIMACES THE HYENA SWINE AVOIDED ME AND I WAS ALWAYS ON THE ALERT FOR HIM MY INSEPARABLE DOG MAN HATED AND DREADED HIM INTENSELY
AND THEY CAME BACK HURRYING AND FEARFUL TO THE MARGIN OF THE WATER LEAVING LONG WAKES OF BLACK IN THE SILVER AT THE WATER'S EDGE THEY STOPPED TURNING AND GLARING INTO THE SEA AS THOUGH THEY PRESENTLY EXPECTED MONTGOMERY TO ARISE THEREFROM AND EXACT VENGEANCE
IS THE LAW NOT ALIVE THIS CAME OF BREAKING THE LAW HE PEERED AT THE BODY HE SENDS THE FIRE THAT KILLS SAID HE IN HIS DEEP VOICE REPEATING PART OF THE RITUAL
THEY HAVE BEEN SLAIN EVEN THE SAYER OF THE LAW EVEN THE OTHER WITH THE WHIP GREAT IS THE LAW COME AND SEE NONE ESCAPE SAID ONE OF THEM ADVANCING AND PEERING NONE ESCAPE SAID I THEREFORE HEAR AND DO AS I COMMAND
PERHAPS HALF A MILE ALONG THE BEACH I BECAME AWARE OF ONE OF MY THREE BEAST FOLK ADVANCING OUT OF THE LANDWARD BUSHES TOWARDS ME I WAS NOW SO NERVOUS WITH MY OWN IMAGININGS THAT I IMMEDIATELY DREW MY REVOLVER
THE GREY THING LEAPT ASIDE M'LING WITH A SNARL FLEW AT IT AND WAS STRUCK ASIDE MONTGOMERY FIRED
THEY LOOKED I NOTICED AT THE DEEP CUTS I MADE IN THE TURF THEN THE SATYR RAISED A DOUBT I ANSWERED HIM THEN ONE OF THE DAPPLED THINGS OBJECTED AND AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION SPRANG UP ROUND THE FIRE EVERY MOMENT I BEGAN TO FEEL MORE CONVINCED OF MY PRESENT SECURITY
I TURNED ONCE MORE ALMOST PASSIONATELY NOW TO HAMMERING TOGETHER STAKES AND BRANCHES TO FORM A RAFT FOR MY ESCAPE I FOUND A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES I AM AN EXTREMELY UNHANDY MAN
AT THE FIRST EXCUSE IT MAY SEEM TREACHEROUS BUT SO I WAS RESOLVED I WAS FAR MORE AFRAID OF HIM THAN OF ANY OTHER TWO OF THE BEAST FOLK HIS CONTINUED LIFE WAS I KNEW A THREAT AGAINST MINE
WE WERE IN JUST THE STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM THAT WOULD REMAIN IN ONE OF THOSE HAPPY FAMILY CAGES WHICH ANIMAL TAMERS EXHIBIT IF THE TAMER WERE TO LEAVE IT FOR EVER OF COURSE THESE CREATURES DID NOT DECLINE INTO SUCH BEASTS AS THE READER HAS SEEN IN ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
THE MONKEY MAN BORED ME HOWEVER HE ASSUMED ON THE STRENGTH OF HIS FIVE DIGITS THAT HE WAS MY EQUAL AND WAS FOR EVER JABBERING AT ME JABBERING THE MOST ARRANT NONSENSE
TWICE WE HEARD UNSEEN CREATURES HOWLING AND SHRIEKING PAST OUR LITTLE BAND AND ONCE THE LITTLE PINK SLOTH CREATURE APPEARED AND STARED AT US AND VANISHED AGAIN BUT WE WERE NOT ATTACKED AGAIN AT THE GATES OF THE ENCLOSURE OUR COMPANY OF BEAST PEOPLE LEFT US M'LING GOING WITH THE REST
MOREAU LAY FACE DOWNWARD IN A TRAMPLED SPACE IN A CANEBRAKE ONE HAND WAS ALMOST SEVERED AT THE WRIST AND HIS SILVERY HAIR WAS DABBLED IN BLOOD HIS HEAD HAD BEEN BATTERED IN BY THE FETTERS OF THE PUMA THE BROKEN CANES BENEATH HIM WERE SMEARED WITH BLOOD
THE MASTER YOU CANNOT SEE YET EVEN NOW HE LISTENS AMONG YOU TRUE TRUE SAID THE DOG MAN THEY WERE STAGGERED AT MY ASSURANCE AN ANIMAL MAY BE FEROCIOUS AND CUNNING ENOUGH BUT IT TAKES A REAL MAN TO TELL A LIE
ON CARRY HIM FAR THEY WENT IN UP TO THEIR ARMPITS AND STOOD REGARDING ME LET GO SAID I AND THE BODY OF MONTGOMERY VANISHED WITH A SPLASH SOMETHING SEEMED TO TIGHTEN ACROSS MY CHEST GOOD SAID I WITH A BREAK IN MY VOICE
WHAT THE MASTER WISHES TO KILL THE MASTER KILLS SAID THE DOG MAN WITH A CERTAIN SATISFACTION IN HIS VOICE AND THAT THEIR SINS MAY GROW I SAID LET THEM LIVE IN THEIR FOLLY UNTIL THEIR TIME IS RIPE LET THEM NOT KNOW THAT I AM THE MASTER
SAID HE WAS DEAD BUT MONTGOMERY WAS STILL SOBER ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND MY MOTIVE IN DENYING MOREAU'S DEATH HE IS NOT DEAD HE SAID SLOWLY NOT DEAD AT ALL NO MORE DEAD THAN I AM SOME
AT FIRST I DID NOT UNDERSTAND BUT PRESENTLY IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT HE WISHED ME TO FOLLOW HIM AND THIS I DID AT LAST SLOWLY FOR THE DAY WAS HOT WHEN WE REACHED THE TREES HE CLAMBERED INTO THEM FOR HE COULD TRAVEL BETTER AMONG THEIR SWINGING CREEPERS THAN ON THE GROUND
MONTGOMERY RAISED HIMSELF SLOWLY AND STARED IN A MUDDLED WAY AT THE SHATTERED BEAST MAN BESIDE HIM IT MORE THAN HALF SOBERED HIM HE SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET THEN I SAW THE GREY THING RETURNING CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE TREES SEE SAID I POINTING TO THE DEAD BRUTE
I HEARD SOMETHING BREATHING SAW SOMETHING CROUCHED TOGETHER CLOSE BESIDE ME I HELD MY BREATH TRYING TO SEE WHAT IT WAS IT BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY INTERMINABLY THEN SOMETHING SOFT AND WARM AND MOIST PASSED ACROSS MY HAND ALL MY MUSCLES CONTRACTED
BUT WITH A CERTAIN LACK OF PRACTICAL SENSE WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY BANE I HAD MADE IT A MILE OR MORE FROM THE SEA AND BEFORE I HAD DRAGGED IT DOWN TO THE BEACH THE THING HAD FALLEN TO PIECES PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL THAT I WAS SAVED FROM LAUNCHING IT
BUT FROM THAT NIGHT UNTIL THE END CAME THERE WAS BUT ONE THING HAPPENED TO TELL SAVE A SERIES OF INNUMERABLE SMALL UNPLEASANT DETAILS AND THE FRETTING OF AN INCESSANT UNEASINESS
A DREADFUL THING THAT I WAS ONLY BEGINNING TO REALISE WAS THAT OVER ALL THIS ISLAND THERE WAS NOW NO SAFE PLACE WHERE I COULD BE ALONE AND SECURE TO REST OR SLEEP I HAD RECOVERED STRENGTH AMAZINGLY SINCE MY LANDING BUT I WAS STILL INCLINED TO BE NERVOUS AND TO BREAK DOWN UNDER ANY GREAT STRESS
I REALISED MORE KEENLY THAN EVER WHAT MOREAU HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE STUBBORN BEAST FLESH THEY WERE REVERTING AND REVERTING VERY RAPIDLY SOME OF THEM THE PIONEERS IN THIS I NOTICED WITH SOME SURPRISE WERE ALL FEMALES
ONE HAD A SHOCK OF RED HAIR LIKE THE CAPTAIN OF THE IPECACUANHA AND A DIRTY WHITE CAP LAY IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT AS I STOOD BESIDE THE BOAT THREE OF THE BEASTS CAME SLINKING OUT OF THE BUSHES AND SNIFFING TOWARDS ME
HE IS NOT DEAD HE IS NOT DEAD JABBERED ANOTHER WE SAW WE SAW SAID SEVERAL VOICES HULLO SUDDENLY SHOUTED MONTGOMERY HULLO THERE CONFOUND YOU SAID I AND GRIPPED MY PISTOL
IS HE DEAD INDEED IS THERE A LAW REPEATED THE MAN IN WHITE IS THERE A LAW THOU OTHER WITH THE WHIP HE IS DEAD SAID THE HAIRY GREY THING AND THEY ALL STOOD WATCHING US
I HEARD HIM YELP SAW HIM RUN SIDEWAYS AND TURN KNEW I HAD MISSED AND CLICKED BACK THE COCK WITH MY THUMB FOR THE NEXT SHOT BUT HE WAS ALREADY RUNNING HEADLONG JUMPING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND I DARED NOT RISK ANOTHER MISS
NOW AND THEN SOME BEAST CREATURE WOULD WATCH ME AND GO LEAPING OFF WHEN I CALLED TO IT THERE CAME A SEASON OF THUNDER STORMS AND HEAVY RAIN WHICH GREATLY RETARDED MY WORK BUT AT LAST THE RAFT WAS COMPLETED I WAS DELIGHTED WITH IT
THERE COULD NOW BE SCARCELY A SCORE LEFT OF THE DANGEROUS CARNIVORES THE BRAVER OF THESE WERE ALREADY DEAD AFTER THE DEATH OF THIS POOR DOG OF MINE MY LAST FRIEND I TOO ADOPTED TO SOME EXTENT THE PRACTICE OF SLUMBERING IN THE DAYTIME IN ORDER TO BE ON MY GUARD AT NIGHT
AT FIRST I SPENT THE DAYLIGHT HOURS ON THE SOUTHWARD BEACH WATCHING FOR A SHIP HOPING AND PRAYING FOR A SHIP I COUNTED ON THE IPECACUANHA RETURNING AS THE YEAR WORE ON BUT SHE NEVER CAME FIVE TIMES I SAW SAILS AND THRICE SMOKE BUT NOTHING EVER TOUCHED THE ISLAND
HE HAD LONG SINCE LOST SPEECH AND ACTIVE MOVEMENT AND THE LANK HAIR OF THE LITTLE BRUTE GREW THICKER EVERY DAY AND HIS STUMPY CLAWS MORE ASKEW
I BEGAN WALKING ALONG THE BEACH IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION DESIGNING TO COME ROUND THE EASTWARD CORNER OF THE ISLAND AND SO APPROACH THE RAVINE OF THE HUTS WITHOUT TRAVERSING THE POSSIBLE AMBUSCADES OF THE THICKETS
IN THE FIRST MONTH OR SO THE BEAST FOLK COMPARED WITH THEIR LATTER CONDITION WERE HUMAN ENOUGH AND FOR ONE OR TWO BESIDES MY CANINE FRIEND I EVEN CONCEIVED A FRIENDLY TOLERANCE THE LITTLE PINK SLOTH CREATURE DISPLAYED AN ODD AFFECTION FOR ME AND TOOK TO FOLLOWING ME ABOUT
HOW THE HAIR BEGAN TO SPREAD OVER THE EXPOSED LIMBS HOW THEIR FOREHEADS FELL AWAY AND THEIR FACES PROJECTED HOW THE QUASI HUMAN INTIMACY I HAD PERMITTED MYSELF WITH SOME OF THEM IN THE FIRST MONTH OF MY LONELINESS BECAME A SHUDDERING HORROR TO RECALL THE CHANGE WAS SLOW AND INEVITABLE
I RECOGNISED THE APE MAN I HAD INDEED ALREADY IDENTIFIED HIS VOICE AND TWO OF THE WHITE SWATHED BROWN FEATURED CREATURES I HAD SEEN IN MONTGOMERY'S BOAT
IT IS WELL I SAID EXTENDING MY HAND FOR ANOTHER LICKING KISS I BEGAN TO REALISE WHAT ITS PRESENCE MEANT AND THE TIDE OF MY COURAGE FLOWED WHERE ARE THE OTHERS I ASKED THEY ARE MAD THEY ARE FOOLS SAID THE DOG MAN
POINTED IS THERE A LAW NOW ASKED THE MONKEY MAN
EVEN NOW THEY TALK TOGETHER BEYOND THERE THEY SAY THE MASTER IS DEAD THE OTHER WITH THE WHIP IS DEAD THAT OTHER WHO WALKED IN THE SEA IS AS WE ARE WE HAVE NO MASTER NO WHIPS NO HOUSE OF PAIN ANY MORE THERE IS AN END
AND SUDDENLY IN A TRAMPLED SPACE I CAME UPON A GHASTLY GROUP MY SAINT BERNARD CREATURE LAY ON THE GROUND DEAD AND NEAR HIS BODY CROUCHED THE HYENA SWINE GRIPPING THE QUIVERING FLESH WITH ITS MISSHAPEN CLAWS GNAWING AT IT AND SNARLING WITH DELIGHT
I MASTER WHO ARE YOU THEY SAY THERE IS NO MASTER NOW BUT I KNOW I KNOW
AND THIS TIME I TOOK CARE OF THE STRENGTH THE ONLY INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE WAS THAT I HAD NO VESSEL TO CONTAIN THE WATER I SHOULD NEED IF I FLOATED FORTH UPON THESE UNTRAVELLED SEAS I WOULD HAVE EVEN TRIED POTTERY BUT THE ISLAND CONTAINED NO CLAY
I ALWAYS HAD A BONFIRE READY BUT NO DOUBT THE VOLCANIC REPUTATION OF THE ISLAND WAS TAKEN TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER THAT I BEGAN TO THINK OF MAKING A RAFT BY THAT TIME MY ARM HAD HEALED AND BOTH MY HANDS WERE AT MY SERVICE AGAIN
I SAW ITS FEATURES VANISH IN A FLASH ITS FACE WAS DRIVEN IN YET IT PASSED ME GRIPPED MONTGOMERY AND HOLDING HIM FELL HEADLONG BESIDE HIM AND PULLED HIM SPRAWLING UPON ITSELF IN ITS DEATH AGONY I FOUND MYSELF ALONE WITH M'LING THE DEAD BRUTE AND THE PROSTRATE MAN
I SNATCHED MY HAND AWAY A CRY OF ALARM BEGAN AND WAS STIFLED IN MY THROAT
A HEAVY FACELESS THING WITH STRANGE RED EYES LOOKING AT US CURIOUSLY FROM AMIDST THE GREEN FOR A SPACE NO ONE SPOKE THEN MONTGOMERY HICCOUGHED WHO SAID HE WAS DEAD
CHILDREN OF THE LAW I SAID HE IS NOT DEAD
AND THE DWINDLING SHREDS OF THE HUMANITY STILL STARTLED ME EVERY NOW AND THEN A MOMENTARY RECRUDESCENCE OF SPEECH PERHAPS AN UNEXPECTED DEXTERITY OF THE FORE FEET A PITIFUL ATTEMPT TO WALK ERECT I TOO MUST HAVE UNDERGONE STRANGE CHANGES
WE LOVE THE LAW AND WILL KEEP IT BUT THERE IS NO PAIN NO MASTER NO WHIPS FOR EVER AGAIN SO THEY SAY BUT I KNOW MASTER I KNOW I FELT IN THE DARKNESS AND PATTED THE DOG MAN'S HEAD IT IS WELL I SAID AGAIN
THE OTHERS GATHERED ROUND AND STARED FOR A SPACE AT LAST WE DREW NEAR THE WESTWARD EXTREMITY OF THE ISLAND WE CAME UPON THE GNAWED AND MUTILATED BODY OF THE PUMA ITS SHOULDER BONE SMASHED BY A BULLET AND PERHAPS TWENTY YARDS FARTHER FOUND AT LAST WHAT WE SOUGHT
DROWSILY AND LOOKING AWAY FROM ME I PASSED THEM AND WENT DOWN INTO THE SHADOW AND ODOURS OF THE ALMOST DESERTED RAVINE IN AN EMPTY HUT I FEASTED ON SOME SPECKED AND HALF DECAYED FRUIT AND THEN AFTER I HAD PROPPED SOME BRANCHES AND STICKS ABOUT THE OPENING
HE HAD AN IDEA I BELIEVE THAT TO GABBLE ABOUT NAMES THAT MEANT NOTHING WAS THE PROPER USE OF SPEECH HE CALLED IT BIG THINKS TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM LITTLE THINKS THE SANE EVERY DAY INTERESTS OF LIFE IF EVER I MADE A REMARK HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HE WOULD PRAISE IT VERY MUCH
THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGED ARM SPEAKS A STRANGE THING SAID ONE OF THE BEAST FOLK I TELL YOU IT IS SO I SAID THE MASTER AND THE HOUSE OF PAIN WILL COME AGAIN WOE BE TO HIM WHO BREAKS THE LAW THEY LOOKED CURIOUSLY AT ONE ANOTHER
SAID I HAVE BROKEN THE LAW THEY WILL DIE SOME HAVE DIED SHOW US NOW WHERE HIS OLD BODY LIES THE BODY HE CAST AWAY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MORE NEED OF IT IT IS THIS WAY MAN WHO WALKED IN THE SEA
I AM YOUR SLAVE MASTER ARE YOU THE ONE I MET ON THE BEACH I ASKED THE SAME MASTER THE THING WAS EVIDENTLY FAITHFUL ENOUGH FOR IT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN UPON ME AS I SLEPT
THEY STOOD UP LOOKING QUESTIONINGLY AT ONE ANOTHER STAND THERE SAID I I PICKED UP THE HATCHETS AND SWUNG THEM BY THEIR HEADS FROM THE SLING OF MY ARM TURNED MONTGOMERY OVER PICKED UP HIS REVOLVER STILL LOADED IN TWO CHAMBERS
AND THEN CAME A DAY A WONDERFUL DAY WHICH I SPENT IN ECSTASY I SAW A SAIL TO THE SOUTHWEST A SMALL SAIL LIKE THAT OF A LITTLE SCHOONER AND FORTHWITH
I THINK NOW THAT HE WAS THE SILLIEST CREATURE I EVER MET HE HAD DEVELOPED IN THE MOST WONDERFUL WAY THE DISTINCTIVE SILLINESS OF MAN WITHOUT LOSING ONE JOT OF THE NATURAL FOLLY OF A MONKEY
PRESENTLY YOU WILL SLAY THEM ALL SAID THE DOG MAN PRESENTLY I ANSWERED I WILL SLAY THEM ALL AFTER CERTAIN DAYS AND CERTAIN THINGS HAVE COME TO PASS EVERY ONE OF THEM SAVE THOSE YOU SPARE EVERY ONE OF THEM SHALL BE SLAIN
M'LING WENT FIRST HIS SHOULDER HUNCHED HIS STRANGE BLACK HEAD MOVING WITH QUICK STARTS AS HE PEERED FIRST ON THIS SIDE OF THE WAY AND THEN ON THAT HE WAS UNARMED HIS AXE HE HAD DROPPED WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED THE SWINE MAN TEETH WERE HIS WEAPONS WHEN IT CAME TO FIGHTING
AND THEN THE OTHERS NONE ATTEMPTED TO RISE OR SALUTE ME I FELT TOO FAINT AND WEARY TO INSIST AND I LET THE MOMENT PASS I WANT FOOD SAID I ALMOST APOLOGETICALLY AND DRAWING NEAR THERE IS FOOD IN THE HUTS SAID AN OX BOAR MAN
WE HAD SOME FOOD AND THEN ALL THREE OF US STARTED IT IS POSSIBLY DUE TO THE TENSION OF MY MIND AT THE TIME BUT EVEN NOW THAT START INTO THE HOT STILLNESS OF THE TROPICAL AFTERNOON IS A SINGULARLY VIVID IMPRESSION
IT RETREATED A LITTLE WAY VERY LIKE A DOG BEING SENT HOME AND STOPPED LOOKING AT ME IMPLORINGLY WITH CANINE BROWN EYES
SO THAT I PREFER TO MAKE NO CHRONICLE FOR THAT GAP OF TIME TO TELL ONLY ONE CARDINAL INCIDENT OF THE TEN MONTHS I SPENT AS AN INTIMATE OF THESE HALF HUMANISED BRUTES THERE IS MUCH THAT STICKS IN MY MEMORY THAT I COULD WRITE THINGS THAT I WOULD CHEERFULLY GIVE MY RIGHT HAND TO FORGET
I FOUND THEIR SIMPLE SCALE OF HONOUR WAS BASED MAINLY ON THE CAPACITY FOR INFLICTING TRENCHANT WOUNDS INDEED I MAY SAY WITHOUT VANITY I HOPE THAT I HELD SOMETHING LIKE PRE EMINENCE AMONG THEM ONE OR TWO WHOM IN A RARE ACCESS OF HIGH SPIRITS I HAD SCARRED RATHER BADLY
BUT AT NIGHT THE AIR WAS HIDEOUS WITH THEIR CALLS AND HOWLING I HAD HALF A MIND TO MAKE A MASSACRE OF THEM TO BUILD TRAPS OR FIGHT THEM WITH MY KNIFE HAD I POSSESSED SUFFICIENT CARTRIDGES I SHOULD NOT HAVE HESITATED TO BEGIN THE KILLING
SUDDENLY A GREAT WHITE BIRD FLEW UP OUT OF THE BOAT AND NEITHER OF THE MEN STIRRED NOR NOTICED IT IT CIRCLED ROUND AND THEN CAME SWEEPING OVERHEAD WITH ITS STRONG WINGS OUTSPREAD THEN I STOPPED SHOUTING AND SAT DOWN ON THE HEADLAND AND RESTED MY CHIN ON MY HANDS AND STARED
ASK ME TO SAY IT AGAIN LEARN IT BY HEART AND GO OFF REPEATING IT WITH A WORD WRONG HERE OR THERE TO ALL THE MILDER OF THE BEAST PEOPLE HE THOUGHT NOTHING OF WHAT WAS PLAIN AND COMPREHENSIBLE I INVENTED SOME VERY CURIOUS BIG THINKS FOR HIS ESPECIAL USE
NONE OF THE ABUNDANT CREEPERS SEEMED LIMBER OR STRONG ENOUGH AND WITH ALL MY LITTER OF SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION I COULD NOT DEVISE ANY WAY OF MAKING THEM SO
BUT MY HEART FAILED ME I WENT BACK TO THE BEACH AND TURNING EASTWARD PAST THE BURNING ENCLOSURE MADE FOR A POINT WHERE A SHALLOW SPIT OF CORAL SAND RAN OUT TOWARDS THE REEF HERE I COULD SIT DOWN AND THINK
TOWARDS NOON CERTAIN OF THEM CAME AND SQUATTED BASKING IN THE HOT SAND THE IMPERIOUS VOICES OF HUNGER AND THIRST PREVAILED OVER MY DREAD I CAME OUT OF THE BUSHES AND REVOLVER IN HAND WALKED DOWN TOWARDS THESE SEATED FIGURES ONE A WOLF WOMAN TURNED HER HEAD AND STARED AT ME
THE MASTER'S WILL IS SWEET SAID THE DOG MAN WITH THE READY TACT OF HIS CANINE BLOOD BUT ONE HAS SINNED SAID I HIM I WILL KILL WHENEVER I MAY MEET HIM WHEN I SAY TO YOU THAT IS HE SEE THAT YOU FALL UPON HIM
ONE KNELT THEN THE OTHER TWO I TURNED AND WALKED TOWARDS THE DEAD BODIES KEEPING MY FACE TOWARDS THE THREE KNEELING BEAST MEN VERY MUCH AS AN ACTOR PASSING UP THE STAGE FACES THE AUDIENCE THEY BROKE THE LAW SAID I PUTTING MY FOOT ON THE SAYER OF THE LAW
JUDE TOUCHED THEM IN HIS HUMBLE WAY AND COULD NOT HELP MODULATING INTO THE HYMN WHICH HAD SO AFFECTED HIM IN THE PREVIOUS WEEK A FIGURE MOVED BEHIND HIM AND THINKING IT WAS STILL THE GIRL WITH THE BROOM JUDE TOOK NO NOTICE
WITHIN THE MULLIONED AND TRANSOMED WINDOWS HE COULD SEE THE BLACK BROWN AND FLAXEN CROWNS OF THE SCHOLARS OVER THE SILLS AND TO PASS THE TIME AWAY HE WALKED DOWN TO THE LEVEL TERRACE WHERE THE ABBEY GARDENS ONCE HAD SPREAD HIS HEART THROBBING IN SPITE OF HIM
AND PUT IT AGAIN IN ITS PLACE THEN BECOMING AWARE THAT SHE HAD NOT OBSCURED THE WINDOWS SHE CAME FORWARD TO DO SO CANDLE IN HAND IT WAS TOO DARK FOR HER TO SEE JUDE WITHOUT
BUT I HAVE NOBODY AND I MUST TELL SOMEBODY JUDE BEFORE I MARRIED HIM I HAD NEVER THOUGHT OUT FULLY WHAT MARRIAGE MEANT EVEN THOUGH I KNEW IT WAS IDIOTIC OF ME THERE IS NO EXCUSE
I WAS OLD ENOUGH AND I THOUGHT I WAS VERY EXPERIENCED SO I RUSHED ON WHEN I HAD GOT INTO THAT TRAINING SCHOOL SCRAPE WITH ALL THE COCK SURENESS OF THE FOOL THAT I WAS
A FASTIDIOUSNESS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE CALLED ALTHOUGH SHE MIGHT RESPECT AND BE GRATEFUL TO HIM I AM MERELY PUTTING A CASE OUGHT SHE TO TRY TO OVERCOME HER PRUDERIES JUDE THREW A TROUBLED LOOK AT HER
BUT WHATEVER HER MOOD HE COULD NOT SAY SHE WAS WRONG IN HER VIEW HE REPLIED I ACQUIESCE YOU ARE RIGHT IT IS A LESSON IN RENUNCIATION WHICH I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO LEARN AT THIS SEASON JUDE
WHOSO PREFERS EITHER MATRIMONY OR OTHER ORDINANCE BEFORE THE GOOD OF MAN AND THE PLAIN EXIGENCE OF CHARITY LET HIM PROFESS PAPIST OR PROTESTANT OR WHAT HE WILL HE IS NO BETTER THAN A PHARISEE J MILTON
I WISH YOU WERE HAPPY WHATEVER I MAY BE I CAN'T BE SO FEW COULD ENTER INTO MY FEELING THEY WOULD SAY TWAS MY FANCIFUL FASTIDIOUSNESS OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND CONDEMN ME
THE FAINT CLICK OF THE TRAP AS DRAGGED ABOUT BY THE WRITHING ANIMAL GUIDED HIM NOW AND REACHING THE SPOT HE STRUCK THE RABBIT ON THE BACK OF THE NECK WITH THE SIDE OF HIS PALM AND IT STRETCHED ITSELF OUT DEAD
THE LAST TO MELCHESTER THAT NIGHT
IT IS QUITE LIKE THE GENUINE ARTICLE ALL CUT UP INTO VERSES TOO SO THAT IT IS LIKE ONE OF THE OTHER EVANGELISTS READ IN A DREAM WHEN THINGS ARE THE SAME YET NOT THE SAME
BUT IF IT IS ONLY A SORDID CONTRACT BASED ON MATERIAL CONVENIENCE IN HOUSEHOLDING RATING AND TAXING AND THE INHERITANCE OF LAND AND MONEY BY CHILDREN MAKING IT NECESSARY THAT THE MALE PARENT SHOULD BE KNOWN WHICH IT SEEMS TO BE
THERE WAS EVER A SECOND SILENT CONVERSATION PASSING BETWEEN THEIR EMOTIONS
AND AGAIN QUESTIONED HIS DEVOTIONAL MOTTO THAT ALL WAS FOR THE BEST HE RETIRED TO REST EARLY BUT HIS SLEEP WAS FITFUL FROM THE SENSE THAT SUE WAS SO NEAR AT HAND
AND WONDERED IF SUE WOULD COME SHE HAD NOT WRITTEN AND THAT SEEMED TO SIGNIFY RATHER THAT SHE WOULD COME THAN THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVING TIMED HER BY HER ONLY POSSIBLE TRAIN HE LOCKED THE DOOR ABOUT MID DAY
BUT I AM SO GLAD YOU GOT THERE FIRST THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO SET THESE STEEL TRAPS OUGHT THEY JUDE HAD REACHED THE WINDOW WHICH WAS QUITE A LOW ONE SO THAT SHE WAS VISIBLE DOWN TO HER WAIST
SUBPRIORESS AND FIFTY NUNS HAD DEMURELY PACED THREE CENTURIES EARLIER RETRACING HIS STEPS HE FOUND THAT HE HAD WAITED TOO LONG AND THAT SUE HAD GONE OUT INTO THE TOWN AT THE HEELS OF THE LAST SCHOLAR
WHAT YOU KNOW HIM I WENT TO SEE HIM
BEARING NAMES NOT LOCAL AS IF SURPRISED BY A CHANGE IN THE LANDSCAPE SO VIOLENT AS TO HINDER THEIR FURTHER PROGRESS AND HERE THEY USUALLY REMAINED ALL THE WINTER TILL THEY TURNED TO SEEK AGAIN THEIR OLD TRACKS IN THE FOLLOWING SPRING
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ALIKE HE SAID DRILY NOW WE'LL HAVE SOME TEA SAID SUE SHALL WE HAVE IT HERE INSTEAD OF IN MY HOUSE IT IS NO TROUBLE TO GET THE KETTLE AND THINGS BROUGHT IN
A NECESSITY WHICH THEY BEMOANED OVER THEIR CUPS IN THE SETTLES OF THEIR INNS ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS IN THOSE DAYS THE SHASTONIANS WERE APPARENTLY NOT WITHOUT A SENSE OF HUMOUR
WOULDN'T THE WOMAN FOR EXAMPLE BE VERY BAD NATURED IF SHE DIDN'T LIKE TO LIVE WITH HER HUSBAND MERELY HER VOICE UNDULATED AND HE GUESSED THINGS MERELY BECAUSE SHE HAD A PERSONAL FEELING AGAINST IT A PHYSICAL OBJECTION
SUE WAS SILENT IS IT WRONG JUDE SHE SAID WITH A TENTATIVE TREMOR FOR A HUSBAND OR WIFE TO TELL A THIRD PERSON THAT THEY ARE UNHAPPY IN THEIR MARRIAGE IF A MARRIAGE CEREMONY IS A RELIGIOUS THING IT IS POSSIBLY WRONG
MISSUS EDLIN HAS PLENTY OF ROOM IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO STAY HERE VERY WELL SHE SAID DUBIOUSLY I DIDN'T TELL HIM I WOULD COME FOR CERTAIN
THEIR PROGRESS TO THE CHURCH BEING ALMOST AT A TROT THE BUSTLING UNDERTAKER HAVING A MORE IMPORTANT FUNERAL AN HOUR LATER THREE MILES OFF
I WISH HE WOULD BEAT ME OR BE FAITHLESS TO ME OR DO SOME OPEN THING THAT I COULD TALK ABOUT AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR FEELING AS I DO BUT HE DOES NOTHING EXCEPT THAT HE HAS GROWN A LITTLE COLD SINCE HE HAS FOUND OUT HOW I FEEL
ALL NOW RUTHLESSLY SWEPT AWAY THROW THE VISITOR EVEN AGAINST HIS WILL INTO A PENSIVE MELANCHOLY WHICH THE STIMULATING ATMOSPHERE AND LIMITLESS LANDSCAPE AROUND HIM CAN SCARCELY DISPEL THE SPOT WAS THE BURIAL PLACE OF A KING AND A QUEEN
YES THERE IS ONE I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT NOW THOUGH I WAS INTERESTED IN IT WHEN MY FORMER FRIEND WAS ALIVE COWPER'S APOCRYPHAL GOSPELS THAT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT I WANT
AS THE MEDICINAL AIR IS TO HIS LUNGS
SHE LOOKED AT THE WINDOW POTS WITH THE GERANIUMS AND CACTUSES WITHERED FOR WANT OF ATTENTION AND THROUGH THEM AT THE OUTER DISTANCE TILL HER EYES BEGAN TO GROW MOIST WHAT IS IT SAID JUDE IN A SOFTENED TONE
SUE AND JUDE HAD GONE SIDE BY SIDE TO THE GRAVE AND NOW SAT DOWN TO TEA IN THE FAMILIAR HOUSE
I PERCEIVE I HAVE SAID THAT IN MERE CONVENTION HONESTLY I DON'T THINK I AM SORRY IT DOES NOT MATTER EITHER WAY SAD TO SAY AS THEY HAD OVERDONE THE GRASP OF HANDS SOME TIME SOONER SHE TOUCHED HIS FINGERS BUT LIGHTLY WHEN HE WENT OUT NOW
HE WONDERED IF SHE TALKED OF HIM TO PHILLOTSON THE GOSPEL OF NICODEMUS IS VERY NICE SHE WENT ON TO KEEP HIM FROM HIS JEALOUS THOUGHTS WHICH SHE READ CLEARLY AS SHE ALWAYS DID INDEED WHEN THEY TALKED ON AN INDIFFERENT SUBJECT AS NOW
AND DREW TOWARDS THE SCHOOL HOUSE THE HOUR WAS TOO EARLY THE PUPILS WERE STILL IN SCHOOL HUMMING SMALL LIKE A SWARM OF GNATS
SHE SHAKES DOWN TO WITH COMFORTABLE INDIFFERENCE IN HALF A DOZEN YEARS BUT THAT IS MUCH LIKE SAYING THAT THE AMPUTATION OF A LIMB IS NO AFFLICTION SINCE A PERSON GETS COMFORTABLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE USE OF A WOODEN LEG OR ARM IN THE COURSE OF TIME
I SAW IT BEFORE YOU HAD DONE IT BUT I THOUGHT I MUSTN'T INTERFERE I WAS WRONG I OUGHT TO HAVE BUT WHAT MAKES YOU ASSUME ALL THIS DEAR BECAUSE
IF I WERE UNHAPPY IT WOULD BE MY FAULT MY WICKEDNESS NOT THAT I SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO DISLIKE HIM HE IS CONSIDERATE TO ME IN EVERYTHING AND HE IS VERY INTERESTING FROM THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL KNOWLEDGE HE HAS ACQUIRED BY READING EVERYTHING THAT COMES IN HIS WAY
ARE PASSED OVER IN THIS AND ONE OF THE QUEEREST AND QUAINTEST SPOTS IN ENGLAND STANDS VIRTUALLY UNVISITED TO DAY IT HAS A UNIQUE POSITION ON THE SUMMIT OF A STEEP AND IMPOSING SCARP RISING ON THE NORTH SOUTH AND WEST SIDES OF THE BOROUGH
WHEN DID YOU SEE HER WHEN I WAS AT CHRISTMINSTER
WHY SURELY A PERSON MAY SAY EVEN PROCLAIM UPON THE HOUSETOPS THAT IT HURTS AND GRIEVES HIM OR HER I HAVE SAID SO ANYHOW TO YOU PRESENTLY SHE WENT ON
THINK NO MORE THAN YOU CAN HELP OF SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY THE DISAPPOINTMENT WAS KEEN HE KNEW HER MOOD THE LOOK OF HER FACE WHEN SHE SUBSCRIBED HERSELF AT LENGTH THUS
NO I AM NOT WHAT HAVE I DONE THEN I AM SURE I THOUGHT WE TWO
AS STRANGE WILD BIRDS ARE SEEN ASSEMBLED ON SOME LOFTY PROMONTORY MEDITATIVELY PAUSING FOR LONGER FLIGHTS OR TO RETURN BY THE COURSE THEY FOLLOWED THITHER SO HERE IN THIS CLIFF TOWN STOOD IN STULTIFIED SILENCE THE YELLOW AND GREEN CARAVANS
YES PARTICULARLY FOR MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY
AND HE KNEW THAT SHE HAD AT THAT MOMENT RECOGNIZED HIM HER FACE SOON BEGAN A PENSIVE SMILE WHICH LASTED TILL HAVING DESCENDED A LITTLE WAY HE MET HER I THOUGHT SHE BEGAN WITH NERVOUS QUICKNESS
I DARESAY IT HAPPENS TO LOTS OF WOMEN ONLY THEY SUBMIT AND I KICK
UNWILLING TO ENTER TILL THE CHILDREN WERE DISMISSED HE REMAINED HERE TILL YOUNG VOICES COULD BE HEARD IN THE OPEN AIR AND GIRLS IN WHITE PINAFORES OVER RED AND BLUE FROCKS APPEARED DANCING ALONG THE PATHS
LET ME HELP YOU EVEN IF I DO LOVE YOU AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T SAY IT I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT I CAN'T ADMIT SO MUCH AS THAT THERE GUESS WHAT YOU LIKE BUT DON'T PRESS ME TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
I KNOW YOU WITH YOUR RELIGIOUS DOCTRINES THINK THAT A MARRIED WOMAN IN TROUBLE OF A KIND LIKE MINE COMMITS A MORTAL SIN IN MAKING A MAN THE CONFIDANT OF IT AS I DID YOU I WISH I HADN'T NOW DON'T WISH IT DEAR HE SAID
WOULD HAVE SHUNNED SUCH ENCOUNTERS IF THEY DOUBTED THEIR OWN STRENGTH BUT HE COULD NOT
THAT IT WOULD BE SO SAD TO LET YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL ALONE AND SO AT THE LAST MOMENT I CAME DEAR FAITHFUL SUE MURMURED JUDE
AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED AND HE MOVED HIS HAND TOWARDS HERS IT MET HIS OWN HALF WAY JUDE GRASPED IT JUST AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE HER MARRIAGE IT IS ODD SHE SAID IN A VOICE QUITE CHANGED THAT I SHOULD CARE ABOUT THAT AIR BECAUSE
JUDE COULD REST NO LONGER TILL HE HAD PUT IT OUT OF ITS PAIN SO DRESSING HIMSELF QUICKLY HE DESCENDED AND BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON WENT ACROSS THE GREEN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUND HE REACHED THE HEDGE BORDERING THE WIDOW'S GARDEN WHEN HE STOOD STILL
LADEN WITH TUBS AND BARRELS FILLED FROM THE WELLS BENEATH THE MOUNTAIN AND HAWKERS RETAILING THEIR CONTENTS AT THE PRICE OF A HALFPENNY A BUCKETFUL THIS DIFFICULTY IN THE WATER SUPPLY TOGETHER WITH TWO OTHER ODD FACTS
THE CENTURIES DID INDEED PONDEROUSLY OVERHANG A YOUNG WIFE WHO PASSED HER TIME HERE SHE HAD OPENED A ROSEWOOD WORK BOX AND WAS LOOKING AT A PHOTOGRAPH HAVING CONTEMPLATED IT A LITTLE WHILE SHE PRESSED IT AGAINST HER BOSOM
OUT OF THE DEEP ALLUVIAL VALE OF BLACKMOOR THE VIEW FROM THE CASTLE GREEN OVER THREE COUNTIES OF VERDANT PASTURE SOUTH MID AND NETHER WESSEX BEING AS SUDDEN A SURPRISE TO THE UNEXPECTANT TRAVELLER'S EYES
VAGUE IMAGININGS OF ITS CASTLE ITS THREE MINTS ITS MAGNIFICENT APSIDAL ABBEY THE CHIEF GLORY OF SOUTH WESSEX ITS TWELVE CHURCHES ITS SHRINES CHANTRIES HOSPITALS ITS GABLED FREESTONE MANSIONS
IT WAS THE RESTING PLACE AND HEADQUARTERS OF THE PROPRIETORS OF WANDERING VANS SHOWS SHOOTING GALLERIES AND OTHER ITINERANT CONCERNS
A PIANO STOOD NEAR ACTUALLY THE OLD PIANO THAT PHILLOTSON HAD POSSESSED AT MARYGREEN AND THOUGH THE DARK AFTERNOON ALMOST PREVENTED HIM SEEING THE NOTES
HIS FEET INVOLUNTARILY TOOK HIM THROUGH THE VENERABLE GRAVEYARD OF TRINITY CHURCH WITH ITS AVENUES OF LIMES IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SCHOOLS AGAIN THEY WERE ENTIRELY IN DARKNESS SHE HAD SAID SHE LIVED OVER THE WAY AT OLD GROVE PLACE
HOWEVER IF GOD DISPOSED NOT WOMAN DID THE NEXT MORNING BUT ONE BROUGHT HIM THIS NOTE FROM HER DON'T COME NEXT WEEK ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT DON'T WE WERE TOO FREE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THAT MORBID HYMN AND THE TWILIGHT
WITH THE ELUSIVENESS OF HER CURIOUS DOUBLE NATURE HOWEVER SUE DID NOT STAND STILL FOR ANY FURTHER GREETING THOUGH IT WANTED SOME TIME TO THE BURIAL
SUCH IS AND SUCH WAS THE NOW WORLD FORGOTTEN SHASTON OR PALLADOUR ITS SITUATION RENDERED WATER THE GREAT WANT OF THE TOWN AND WITHIN LIVING MEMORY HORSES DONKEYS AND MEN MAY HAVE BEEN SEEN TOILING UP THE WINDING WAYS TO THE TOP OF THE HEIGHT
BUT I MUST TELL HIM WHO RICHARD OH
AT SOME TIME NEAR TWO O'CLOCK WHEN HE WAS BEGINNING TO SLEEP MORE SOUNDLY HE WAS AROUSED BY A SHRILL SQUEAK THAT HAD BEEN FAMILIAR ENOUGH TO HIM WHEN HE LIVED REGULARLY AT MARYGREEN IT WAS THE CRY OF A RABBIT CAUGHT IN A GIN
OH I AM VERY MISERABLE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO DON'T COME NEAR ME JUDE BECAUSE YOU MUSTN'T DON'T DON'T BUT HE HAD JUMPED UP AND PUT HIS FACE AGAINST HERS OR RATHER AGAINST HER EAR HER FACE BEING INACCESSIBLE
I HAVE BEEN THINKING SHE CONTINUED
TWO MILES BEHIND IT A JET OF WHITE STEAM WAS TRAVELLING FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT OF THE PICTURE THERE WAS A LONG TIME TO WAIT EVEN NOW TILL HE WOULD KNOW IF SHE HAD ARRIVED
A HOUSE WHICH HE SOON DISCOVERED FROM HER DESCRIPTION OF ITS ANTIQUITY A GLIMMERING CANDLELIGHT SHONE FROM A FRONT WINDOW THE SHUTTERS BEING YET UNCLOSED HE COULD SEE THE INTERIOR CLEARLY THE FLOOR SINKING A COUPLE OF STEPS BELOW THE ROAD WITHOUT
THE NATURAL PICTURESQUENESS AND SINGULARITY OF THE TOWN STILL REMAIN BUT STRANGE TO SAY THESE QUALITIES
WE WON'T GET ON TO THAT NOW SHE COAXED WILL YOU BE CARVING OUT AT THAT CHURCH AGAIN NEXT WEEK WHERE YOU LEARNT THE PRETTY HYMN YES PERHAPS THAT WILL BE VERY NICE SHALL I COME AND SEE YOU THERE
WHICH SHE DID IN A VANQUISHED TONE VERGING ON TEARS I I THINK I MUST BE EQUALLY HONEST WITH YOU AS YOU HAVE BEEN WITH ME PERHAPS YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT IT IS I WANT TO SAY
WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ENORMOUS ABBEY THE WHOLE PLACE COLLAPSED IN A GENERAL RUIN THE MARTYR'S BONES MET WITH THE FATE OF THE SACRED PILE THAT HELD THEM AND NOT A STONE IS NOW LEFT TO TELL WHERE THEY LIE
ARE THERE MANY COUPLES DO YOU THINK WHERE ONE DISLIKES THE OTHER FOR NO DEFINITE FAULT YES I SUPPOSE IF EITHER CARES FOR ANOTHER PERSON FOR INSTANCE BUT EVEN APART FROM THAT
DO YOU THINK JUDE THAT A MAN OUGHT TO MARRY A WOMAN HIS OWN AGE OR ONE YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF EIGHTEEN YEARS AS I AM THAN HE IT DEPENDS UPON WHAT THEY FEEL FOR EACH OTHER
IT WAS TO THIS BREEZY AND WHIMSICAL SPOT THAT JUDE ASCENDED FROM THE NEAREST STATION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK ONE AFTERNOON AND ENTERING ON THE SUMMIT OF THE PEAK AFTER A TOILSOME CLIMB PASSED THE FIRST HOUSES OF THE AERIAL TOWN
THAT THOUGH I LIKE MISTER PHILLOTSON AS A FRIEND I DON'T LIKE HIM IT IS A TORTURE TO ME TO LIVE WITH HIM AS A HUSBAND THERE NOW I HAVE LET IT OUT I COULDN'T HELP IT ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN PRETENDING I AM HAPPY
HAVE TO THE REAL STAR PATTERNS I AM CALLED MISSUS RICHARD PHILLOTSON LIVING A CALM WEDDED LIFE WITH MY COUNTERPART OF THAT NAME BUT I AM NOT REALLY MISSUS RICHARD PHILLOTSON BUT A WOMAN TOSSED ABOUT
SUE I SOMETIMES THINK YOU ARE A FLIRT SAID HE ABRUPTLY THERE WAS A MOMENTARY PAUSE TILL SHE SUDDENLY JUMPED UP AND TO HIS SURPRISE HE SAW BY THE KETTLE FLAME THAT HER FACE WAS FLUSHED
MISTER PHILLOTSON HAVING BEEN ABSENT ALL THE AFTERNOON AT A TEACHERS MEETING AT SHOTTSFORD JUDE WENT INTO THE EMPTY SCHOOLROOM AND SAT DOWN THE GIRL WHO WAS SWEEPING THE FLOOR HAVING INFORMED HIM THAT MISSUS PHILLOTSON WOULD BE BACK AGAIN IN A FEW MINUTES
WHAT TORTURES ME SO MUCH IS THE NECESSITY OF BEING RESPONSIVE TO THIS MAN WHENEVER HE WISHES GOOD AS HE IS MORALLY THE DREADFUL CONTRACT TO FEEL IN A PARTICULAR WAY IN A MATTER WHOSE ESSENCE IS ITS VOLUNTARINESS
KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES THE BONES OF KING EDWARD THE MARTYR CAREFULLY REMOVED HITHER FOR HOLY PRESERVATION BROUGHT SHASTON A RENOWN WHICH MADE IT THE RESORT OF PILGRIMS FROM EVERY PART OF EUROPE
PLAY IT FOR ME OH WELL I DON'T MIND SUE SAT DOWN AND HER RENDERING OF THE PIECE THOUGH NOT REMARKABLE SEEMED DIVINE AS COMPARED WITH HIS OWN SHE LIKE HIM WAS EVIDENTLY TOUCHED TO HER OWN SURPRISE BY THE RECALLED AIR
WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO GLAD TO GO BACK TO HER IF IF WHAT YOU USED TO SAY TO ME IS STILL TRUE I MEAN IF IT WERE TRUE THEN OF COURSE IT IS NOT NOW
HE DID WAIT HOWEVER AND AT LAST A SMALL HIRED VEHICLE PULLED UP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL AND A PERSON ALIGHTED THE CONVEYANCE GOING BACK WHILE THE PASSENGER BEGAN ASCENDING THE HILL HE KNEW HER
I WONDER WHAT WE BOTH DID THAT FOR I SUPPOSE BECAUSE WE ARE BOTH ALIKE AS I SAID BEFORE NOT IN OUR THOUGHTS PERHAPS A LITTLE IN OUR FEELINGS AND THEY RULE THOUGHTS
POOR AUNT DRUSILLA IT WAS AS HE HAD SUPPOSED AND MISSUS EDLIN HAD SENT OUT THE MAN TO BREAK THE NEWS TO HIM
SUE DREW HERS AWAY THAT'S ABSURD SUE CRIED HE AFTER WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
TILL THE PERSON CAME CLOSE AND LAID HER FINGERS LIGHTLY UPON HIS BASS HAND THE IMPOSED HAND WAS A LITTLE ONE HE SEEMED TO KNOW AND HE TURNED DON'T STOP SAID SUE I LIKE IT I LEARNT IT BEFORE I LEFT MELCHESTER THEY USED TO PLAY IT IN THE TRAINING SCHOOL
AS WAS THE LITTLE CREATURE'S HABIT IT DID NOT SOON REPEAT ITS CRY AND PROBABLY WOULD NOT DO SO MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE BUT WOULD REMAIN BEARING ITS TORTURE TILL THE MORROW WHEN THE TRAPPER WOULD COME AND KNOCK IT ON THE HEAD
AND CROSSED THE HOLLOW FIELD TO THE VERGE OF THE UPLAND BY THE BROWN HOUSE WHERE HE STOOD AND LOOKED OVER THE VAST PROSPECT NORTHWARDS AND OVER THE NEARER LANDSCAPE IN WHICH ALFREDSTON STOOD
WHENCE HE REGARDED THE SPOT WHICH FATE HAD MADE THE HOME OF ALL HE LOVED BEST IN THE WORLD IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOLS WHICH WERE EXTENSIVE AND STONE BUILT GREW TWO ENORMOUS BEECHES WITH SMOOTH MOUSE COLOURED TRUNKS AS SUCH TREES WILL ONLY GROW ON CHALK UPLANDS
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU ANY LONGER JUDE SHE SAID THE TRAGIC CONTRALTO NOTE HAVING COME BACK AS OF OLD IT IS GETTING TOO DARK TO STAY TOGETHER LIKE THIS AFTER PLAYING MORBID GOOD FRIDAY TUNES THAT MAKE ONE FEEL WHAT ONE SHOULDN'T WE MUSTN'T SIT AND TALK IN THIS WAY ANY MORE
AND WHEN SHE RETURNED FOLLOWED BY THE MAIDEN WITH TEA THEY SAT DOWN BY THE SAME LIGHT ASSISTED BY THE BLUE RAYS OF A SPIRIT LAMP UNDER THE BRASS KETTLE ON THE STAND THIS IS ONE OF YOUR WEDDING PRESENTS TO ME SHE SAID SIGNIFYING THE LATTER YES
NO I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SAID JUDE THE KETTLE OF HIS GIFT SANG WITH SOME SATIRE IN ITS NOTE TO HIS MIND AND TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT HE SAID DO YOU KNOW OF ANY GOOD READABLE EDITION OF THE UNCANONICAL BOOKS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT YOU DON'T READ THEM IN THE SCHOOL I SUPPOSE OH DEAR NO
THE SHORT CUT WAS MADE TO THE VILLAGE AS HE ASCENDED ON THE OTHER SIDE A LABOURING MAN WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING HIS APPROACH FROM A GATE ACROSS THE PATH MOVED UNEASILY AND PREPARED TO SPEAK I CAN SEE IN HIS FACE THAT SHE IS DEAD SAID JUDE
I FEEL CRUSHED INTO THE EARTH BY THE WEIGHT OF SO MANY PREVIOUS LIVES THERE SPENT IN A NEW PLACE LIKE THESE SCHOOLS THERE IS ONLY YOUR OWN LIFE TO SUPPORT
JUDE SAID A VOICE TIMIDLY SUE'S VOICE IT IS YOU IS IT NOT YES DEAR I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AT ALL AND THEN I HEARD THE RABBIT AND COULDN'T HELP THINKING OF WHAT IT SUFFERED TILL I FELT I MUST COME DOWN AND KILL IT
AS IT MEANS NOTHING IT MAY BE BOTHERING HIM NEEDLESSLY
SHE PLAYED ON AND SUDDENLY TURNED ROUND AND BY AN UNPREMEDITATED INSTINCT EACH CLASPED THE OTHER'S HAND AGAIN SHE UTTERED A FORCED LITTLE LAUGH AS SHE RELINQUISHED HIS QUICKLY HOW FUNNY SHE SAID
I TOLD YOU NOT TO JUDE I KNOW YOU DID I ONLY WISH TO CONSOLE YOU IT ALL AROSE THROUGH MY BEING MARRIED BEFORE WE MET DIDN'T IT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN MY WIFE SUE WOULDN'T YOU IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THAT
HE SAID LOOKING AWAY IT WOULD BE JUST ONE OF THOSE CASES IN WHICH MY EXPERIENCES GO CONTRARY TO MY DOGMAS SPEAKING AS AN ORDER LOVING MAN WHICH I HOPE I AM THOUGH I FEAR I AM NOT I SHOULD SAY YES
HE THOUGHT HE HEARD THE WHEELS OF THE COACH DEPARTING AND TRULY ENOUGH WHEN HE REACHED THE DUKE'S ARMS IN THE MARKET PLACE THE COACH HAD GONE
ALL ALONE WITH ABERRANT PASSIONS AND UNACCOUNTABLE ANTIPATHIES NOW YOU MUSTN'T WAIT LONGER OR YOU WILL LOSE THE COACH COME AND SEE ME AGAIN YOU MUST COME TO THE HOUSE THEN YES SAID JUDE WHEN SHALL IT BE
HE WHO IN HIS CHILDHOOD HAD SAVED THE LIVES OF THE EARTHWORMS NOW BEGAN TO PICTURE THE AGONIES OF THE RABBIT FROM ITS LACERATED LEG IF IT WERE A BAD CATCH BY THE HIND LEG
AND WHERE THERE WERE MORE WANTON WOMEN THAN HONEST WIVES AND MAIDS IT IS ALSO SAID THAT AFTER THE MIDDLE AGES THE INHABITANTS WERE TOO POOR TO PAY THEIR PRIESTS AND HENCE WERE COMPELLED TO PULL DOWN THEIR CHURCHES AND REFRAIN ALTOGETHER FROM THE PUBLIC WORSHIP OF GOD
IT IS NONE OF THE NATURAL TRAGEDIES OF LOVE THAT'S LOVE'S USUAL TRAGEDY IN CIVILIZED LIFE BUT A TRAGEDY ARTIFICIALLY MANUFACTURED FOR PEOPLE WHO IN A NATURAL STATE WOULD FIND RELIEF IN PARTING
I SUPPOSE YOU WILL LIVE WITH HER NOW OF COURSE JUST AS YOU LIVE WITH YOUR HUSBAND
BUT JUDE DO YOU TAKE AN INTEREST IN THOSE QUESTIONS STILL ARE YOU GETTING UP APOLOGETICA YES I AM READING DIVINITY HARDER THAN EVER SHE REGARDED HIM CURIOUSLY WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT SAID JUDE
THE LATTER BEING CROSSED BY HUGE MOULDED BEAMS ONLY A LITTLE WAY ABOVE HER HEAD THE MANTELPIECE WAS OF THE SAME HEAVY DESCRIPTION CARVED WITH JACOBEAN PILASTERS AND SCROLL WORK
SHOULD A WEAK SPRINGED INSTRUMENT ENABLE IT TO ESCAPE IT WOULD DIE IN THE FIELDS FROM THE MORTIFICATION OF THE LIMB IF IT WERE A GOOD CATCH NAMELY BY THE FORE LEG THE BONE WOULD BE BROKEN AND THE LIMB NEARLY TORN IN TWO IN ATTEMPTS AT AN IMPOSSIBLE ESCAPE
AND HOW MUCH I FEEL THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH ATTRACTIVENESS UNLESS IT WERE MEANT TO BE EXERCISED SOME WOMEN'S LOVE OF BEING LOVED IS INSATIABLE AND SO OFTEN IS THEIR LOVE OF LOVING
BUT SHE HAD OTHERS HE KNEW YET IT WAS HIS SURELY HE KNEW HE SHOULD GO TO SEE HER AGAIN ACCORDING TO HER INVITATION
NOW THE LAST TIE BETWEEN US AUNT DRUSILLA IS DEAD JUDE SEIZED HER HAND AND KISSED IT THERE IS A STRONGER ONE LEFT HE SAID I'LL NEVER CARE ABOUT MY DOCTRINES OR MY RELIGION ANY MORE LET THEM GO
NAMELY THAT THE CHIEF GRAVEYARD SLOPES UP AS STEEPLY AS A ROOF BEHIND THE CHURCH AND THAT IN FORMER TIMES THE TOWN PASSED THROUGH A CURIOUS PERIOD OF CORRUPTION CONVENTUAL AND DOMESTIC
IT IS HORRIBLE HOW WE ARE CIRCUMSTANCED SUE HORRIBLE HE SAID ABRUPTLY WITH HIS EYES BENT TO THE FLOOR NO WHY I CAN'T TELL YOU ALL MY PART OF THE GLOOM YOUR PART IS THAT YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE MARRIED HIM
ABSOLUTELY SURE I HAVE NO FEELINGS OF LOVE LEFT IN ME THAT'S NEWS HOW HAS IT COME TO BE I'VE SEEN ARABELLA SHE WINCED AT THE HIT THEN SAID CURIOUSLY
AND SHE LOOKED SO SLENDER TO DAY THAT IT SEEMED AS IF SHE MIGHT BE CRUSHED IN THE INTENSITY OF A TOO PASSIONATE EMBRACE SUCH AS IT WAS NOT FOR HIM TO GIVE
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MY VIEW BUT MY DOCTRINES AND I BEGIN TO PART COMPANY I KNEW IT I KNEW IT AND THAT'S WHY I VOWED I WOULDN'T DISTURB YOUR BELIEF BUT I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU AND OH I DIDN'T MEAN TO SEE YOU AGAIN
HE DESPATCHED THE NOTE ON EASTER EVE AND THERE SEEMED A FINALITY IN THEIR DECISIONS BUT OTHER FORCES AND LAWS THAN THEIRS WERE IN OPERATION ON EASTER MONDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE WIDOW EDLIN
TO MORROW WEEK GOOD BYE GOOD BYE SHE STRETCHED OUT HER HAND AND STROKED HIS FOREHEAD PITIFULLY JUST ONCE JUDE SAID GOOD BYE AND WENT AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS PASSING ALONG BIMPORT STREET
FLASHED AS IT WERE BY CHANCE
HE THOUGHT RECKONING IT UP FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON BUT HE SOON FORGOT WITH WHAT OBJECT HE HAD TAKEN THE MONEY OUT OF HIS POCKET HE RECALLED IT
HE WAS BY NOW LOOKING CHEERFUL AS THOUGH HE WERE SUDDENLY SET FREE FROM A TERRIBLE BURDEN AND HE GAZED ROUND IN A FRIENDLY WAY AT THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM BUT EVEN AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD A DIM FOREBODING
THE FLOOR AND THE FURNITURE WERE BRIGHTLY POLISHED
HAD OVERTAKEN HIM I KNEW IT HE MUTTERED IN CONFUSION I THOUGHT SO
THAT ANY LANDLADY COULD DO
THAT'S WORTH KNOWING STRONG BOXES ALWAYS HAVE KEYS LIKE THAT
WHEN WITH A START HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AGAIN
HE GAZED THROUGH THE FENCE HE SAW IN THE DISTANCE SMARTLY DRESSED WOMEN ON THE VERANDAHS AND BALCONIES
THREE TIMES AS BIG AS ALL THE OTHERS
YOU COME WITH SUCH TRIFLES MY GOOD SIR IT'S SCARCELY WORTH ANYTHING I GAVE YOU TWO ROUBLES LAST TIME
THE OLD WOMAN COUGHED AND GROANED AT EVERY INSTANT THE YOUNG MAN MUST HAVE LOOKED AT HER WITH A RATHER PECULIAR EXPRESSION FOR A GLEAM OF MISTRUST CAME INTO HER EYES AGAIN
BUT ANYONE AT ALL HE WAS CRUSHED BY POVERTY
ALL TORN AND BESPATTERED BRIMLESS AND BENT ON ONE SIDE IN A MOST UNSEEMLY FASHION
NEAR THE TAVERN THE ROAD BECAME A DUSTY TRACK THE DUST OF WHICH WAS ALWAYS BLACK
IN WHICH STOOD THE OLD WOMAN'S BED AND CHEST OF DRAWERS
THAT MAKES IT NOTICEABLE WITH MY RAGS I OUGHT TO WEAR A CAP ANY SORT OF OLD PANCAKE BUT NOT THIS GROTESQUE THING
AND WHENEVER HE VISITED THE GRAVEYARD HE USED RELIGIOUSLY AND REVERENTLY TO CROSS HIMSELF AND TO BOW DOWN
GIVE ME FOUR ROUBLES FOR IT I SHALL REDEEM IT IT WAS MY FATHER'S I SHALL BE GETTING SOME MONEY SOON
ORDINARY ACTION COULD I HAVE EXPECTED TO SET IT ALL STRAIGHT AND TO FIND A WAY OUT BY MEANS OF RAZUMIHIN ALONE
AN OVAL TABLE IN FRONT OF THE SOFA A DRESSING TABLE WITH A LOOKING GLASS FIXED ON IT BETWEEN THE WINDOWS CHAIRS ALONG THE WALLS
ON THE WAY TO THE GRAVEYARD
OF THE OLD WOMAN'S FLAT THE BELL GAVE A FAINT TINKLE AS THOUGH IT WERE MADE OF TIN AND NOT OF COPPER THE LITTLE FLATS IN SUCH HOUSES ALWAYS HAVE BELLS
LOOKING ROUND HE NOTICED THAT HE WAS STANDING CLOSE TO A TAVERN WHICH WAS ENTERED BY STEPS LEADING FROM THE PAVEMENT TO THE BASEMENT AT THAT INSTANT TWO DRUNKEN MEN
IT WOULD BE NOTICED A MILE OFF IT WOULD BE REMEMBERED WHAT MATTERS IS THAT PEOPLE WOULD REMEMBER IT
HE HAD SUCCESSFULLY AVOIDED MEETING HIS LANDLADY ON THE STAIRCASE HIS GARRET WAS UNDER THE ROOF OF A HIGH FIVE STORIED HOUSE AND WAS MORE
AIRLESSNESS THE BUSTLE AND THE PLASTER SCAFFOLDING BRICKS AND DUST ALL ABOUT HIM AND THAT SPECIAL PETERSBURG STENCH
HIS NERVOUS SHUDDER HAD PASSED INTO A FEVER THAT MADE HIM FEEL SHIVERING
HE WALKED ALONG THE PAVEMENT LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN REGARDLESS OF THE PASSERS BY AND JOSTLING AGAINST THEM AND ONLY CAME TO HIS SENSES WHEN HE WAS IN THE NEXT STREET
HE USED TO CLING CLOSE TO HIS FATHER TREMBLING ALL OVER
FOR THIS BUSINESS ONE SHOULD BE AS LITTLE CONSPICUOUS AS POSSIBLE TRIFLES TRIFLES ARE WHAT MATTER WHY IT'S JUST SUCH TRIFLES
PARTITIONED OFF FROM THE TINY KITCHEN THE OLD WOMAN STOOD FACING HIM IN SILENCE
AND A HALF FOR THE MONTH IN ADVANCE BUT FOR THE TWO ROUBLES I LENT YOU BEFORE YOU OWE ME NOW TWENTY COPECKS ON THE SAME RECKONING IN ADVANCE
WITH EVIDENT DISTRUST THROUGH THE CRACK AND NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT HER LITTLE EYES
AND ABUSING AND SUPPORTING ONE ANOTHER
ON COMING OUT INTO THE STREET HE BECAME
I SHALL GO TO RAZUMIHIN'S OF COURSE BUT NOT NOW I SHALL GO TO HIM ON THE NEXT DAY AFTER IT WHEN IT WILL BE OVER AND EVERYTHING
BUT CHECKED HIMSELF AT ONCE REMEMBERING THAT THERE WAS NOWHERE ELSE HE COULD GO
BAWLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE AND POINTING AT HIM THE YOUNG MAN STOPPED SUDDENLY AND CLUTCHED TREMULOUSLY AT HIS HAT
LAUGHTER AND ABUSE HIDEOUS HOARSE SINGING AND OFTEN FIGHTING
THE LITTLE ROOM INTO WHICH THE YOUNG MAN WALKED WITH YELLOW PAPER ON THE WALLS GERANIUMS AND MUSLIN CURTAINS IN THE WINDOWS WAS BRIGHTLY LIGHTED UP AT THAT MOMENT BY THE SETTING SUN
BUT TO BE STOPPED ON THE STAIRS TO BE FORCED TO LISTEN TO HER TRIVIAL IRRELEVANT GOSSIP TO PESTERING DEMANDS FOR PAYMENT THREATS AND COMPLAINTS
NEAR THE ENTRANCE OF THE TAVERN STOOD A CART
REMEMBERING THAT HE OUGHT TO BE MORE POLITE
DRUNK BUT NOT EXTREMELY SO SITTING BEFORE A POT OF BEER AND HIS COMPANION A HUGE STOUT MAN
AS IF IT WERE SPONTANEOUSLY AND BY CHANCE
AM I CAPABLE OF THAT IS THAT SERIOUS IT IS NOT SERIOUS AT ALL IT'S SIMPLY A FANTASY TO AMUSE MYSELF A PLAYTHING YES
RASKOLNIKOV THOUGHT BUT WHAT HELP CAN HE BE TO ME NOW SUPPOSE HE GETS ME LESSONS
ON AN EXCEPTIONALLY HOT EVENING EARLY IN JULY A YOUNG MAN CAME OUT OF THE GARRET IN WHICH HE LODGED IN S PLACE AND WALKED SLOWLY AS THOUGH IN HESITATION TOWARDS K BRIDGE
HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE NOTE OF THAT BELL AND NOW ITS PECULIAR TINKLE SEEMED TO REMIND HIM OF SOMETHING
AS AN EXPLOIT TO BE ATTEMPTED ALTHOUGH HE STILL DID NOT REALISE THIS HIMSELF
IN THE STREETS THAT NO FIGURE HOWEVER QUEER WOULD HAVE CAUSED SURPRISE BUT THERE WAS SUCH ACCUMULATED BITTERNESS AND CONTEMPT IN THE YOUNG MAN'S HEART
HE ADDED RESOLUTELY
HE WAS HOPELESSLY IN DEBT TO HIS LANDLADY AND WAS AFRAID OF MEETING HER THIS WAS NOT BECAUSE HE WAS COWARDLY AND ABJECT
WAS BEING TAKEN SOMEWHERE IN A HUGE WAGGON DRAGGED BY A HEAVY DRAY HORSE SUDDENLY SHOUTED AT HIM AS HE DROVE PAST
AND TO RACK HIS BRAINS FOR EXCUSES TO PREVARICATE
FROM TIME TO TIME HE WOULD MUTTER SOMETHING FROM THE HABIT OF TALKING TO HIMSELF TO WHICH HE HAD JUST CONFESSED AT THESE MOMENTS HE WOULD BECOME CONSCIOUS
INVARIABLY STOOD OPEN AND EACH TIME HE PASSED THE YOUNG MAN HAD A SICK FRIGHTENED FEELING WHICH MADE HIM SCOWL AND FEEL ASHAMED
TO RAZUMIHIN'S HE SAID ALL AT ONCE CALMLY
AND AT EVERY STEP HIS EXCITEMENT GREW MORE AND MORE VIOLENT
IT MUST BE THE TOP DRAWER HE REFLECTED SO SHE CARRIES THE KEYS IN A POCKET ON THE RIGHT
I CHATTER BECAUSE I DO NOTHING
THEIR HUSBANDS AND RIFF RAFF OF ALL SORTS
BUT COMPLETELY WORN OUT
IN A SHORT FULL SKIRTED COAT HE WAS VERY DRUNK AND HAD DROPPED ASLEEP ON THE BENCH EVERY NOW AND THEN HE BEGAN AS THOUGH IN HIS SLEEP
MAYBE IT IS A PLAYTHING THE HEAT IN THE STREET WAS TERRIBLE
NO STIFLING CLOSENESS NO STENCH BUT SOON THESE NEW PLEASANT SENSATIONS PASSED INTO MORBID IRRITABILITY SOMETIMES HE STOOD STILL BEFORE A BRIGHTLY
MIND WAS ALSO NOT NORMAL
REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN IS IT POSSIBLE IT REALLY WILL HAPPEN HE LEFT THE SEAT AND WENT OFF ALMOST AT A RUN HE MEANT TO TURN BACK HOMEWARDS
AS HE WALKED AWAY IT WAS A LONG WHILE SINCE HE HAD TAKEN VODKA AND IT HAD AN EFFECT UPON HIM AT ONCE THOUGH HE ONLY DRANK A WINEGLASSFUL HIS LEGS FELT SUDDENLY HEAVY
BUT SEEING A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE LANDING SHE GREW BOLDER AND OPENED THE DOOR WIDE THE YOUNG MAN STEPPED INTO THE DARK ENTRY WHICH WAS
EXCEPTIONALLY HANDSOME ABOVE THE AVERAGE IN HEIGHT SLIM WELL BUILT WITH BEAUTIFUL DARK EYES AND DARK BROWN HAIR
TO WAIT OR TO SELL YOUR PLEDGE AT ONCE HOW MUCH WILL YOU GIVE ME FOR THE WATCH
HE WOULD CREEP DOWN THE STAIRS LIKE A CAT AND SLIP OUT UNSEEN THIS EVENING
AND CAN I CAN I POSSIBLY
ON THE RIGHT AND UP THE STAIRCASE IT WAS A BACK STAIRCASE DARK
YES MY HAT IS TOO NOTICEABLE
ONLY A ROUBLE AND FIFTEEN COPECKS NOW JUST SO THE YOUNG MAN DID NOT DISPUTE IT AND TOOK THE MONEY
SOON HE SANK INTO DEEP THOUGHT OR MORE ACCURATELY SPEAKING INTO A COMPLETE BLANKNESS OF MIND
IN PERPLEXITY HE PONDERED
WHEN HE HAD BEEN LOST IN DREAMS AT THE TIME HE HAD PUT NO FAITH
THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN IN THE ROOM
WITH A GREEN CUPOLA WHERE HE USED TO GO TO MASS TWO OR THREE TIMES A YEAR WITH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WHEN A SERVICE WAS HELD IN MEMORY OF HIS GRANDMOTHER
ROOM THE LANDLADY WHO PROVIDED HIM WITH GARRET DINNERS AND ATTENDANCE LIVED ON THE FLOOR BELOW AND EVERY TIME HE WENT OUT
WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK RASKOLNIKOV WENT DOWN THE STEPS AT ONCE
NOW A MONTH LATER HE HAD BEGUN TO LOOK UPON THEM DIFFERENTLY AND IN SPITE OF THE MONOLOGUES IN WHICH HE JEERED AT HIS OWN IMPOTENCE AND INDECISION
AND A GREAT DROWSINESS CAME UPON HIM HE TURNED HOMEWARDS BUT REACHING PETROVSKY OSTROV HE STOPPED COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED TURNED OFF THE ROAD INTO THE BUSHES SANK DOWN UPON THE GRASS
WHO HAD LONG BEEN DEAD AND WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN ON THESE OCCASIONS
TRYING AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO NOTICE AND REMEMBER ITS ARRANGEMENT BUT THERE WAS NOTHING SPECIAL IN THE ROOM
ALL IS IN A MAN'S HANDS AND HE LETS IT ALL SLIP FROM COWARDICE THAT'S AN AXIOM IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW WHAT IT IS MEN ARE MOST AFRAID OF
AND WORKING CLASS POPULATION CROWDED IN THESE STREETS AND ALLEYS IN THE HEART OF PETERSBURG
BUT NO WORDS NO EXCLAMATIONS COULD EXPRESS HIS AGITATION THE FEELING OF INTENSE REPULSION
HAND IT OVER HE SAID ROUGHLY THE OLD WOMAN FUMBLED IN HER POCKET FOR HER KEYS AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE CURTAIN INTO THE OTHER ROOM
TO HIS WEARY EYES AFTER THE DUST OF THE TOWN AND THE HUGE HOUSES THAT HEMMED HIM IN
WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO BE SEEN IN THE STREET IN SUCH RAGS IN THAT QUARTER OF THE TOWN HOWEVER
BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED
THE OLD FASHIONED UNADORNED IKONS AND THE OLD PRIEST WITH THE SHAKING HEAD
THE MONTH WAS UP THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
CAME OUT ON TO THE LESSER NEVA CROSSED THE BRIDGE AND TURNED TOWARDS THE ISLANDS THE GREENNESS AND FRESHNESS WERE AT FIRST RESTFUL
HE WATCHED THEM WITH CURIOUS EYES AND FORGOT ABOUT THEM BEFORE THEY HAD VANISHED FROM HIS SIGHT ONCE HE STOOD STILL AND COUNTED HIS MONEY
HE ASKED HER AS CASUALLY AS POSSIBLE
THAT MAKES THIRTY FIVE COPECKS ALTOGETHER SO I MUST GIVE YOU A ROUBLE AND FIFTEEN COPECKS
HE SAT DOWN AT A STICKY LITTLE TABLE IN A DARK AND DIRTY CORNER
HE FORGOT AT ONCE WHAT HE HAD JUST BEEN THINKING ABOUT AND EVEN WHERE HE WAS GOING IN THIS WAY
SO FAMILIAR TO ALL WHO ARE UNABLE TO GET OUT OF TOWN IN SUMMER
HE STARTED HIS NERVES WERE TERRIBLY OVERSTRAINED BY NOW IN A LITTLE WHILE THE DOOR WAS OPENED A TINY CRACK THE OLD WOMAN EYED HER VISITOR
RASKOLNIKOV HAD A FEARFUL DREAM HE DREAMT HE WAS BACK IN HIS CHILDHOOD IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF HIS BIRTH HE WAS A CHILD ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD
THE FLOWERS ESPECIALLY CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION HE GAZED AT THEM LONGER THAN AT ANYTHING HE WAS MET TOO BY LUXURIOUS CARRIAGES AND BY MEN AND WOMEN ON HORSEBACK
AND INSTANTLY FELL ASLEEP IN A MORBID CONDITION OF THE BRAIN DREAMS OFTEN HAVE A SINGULAR ACTUALITY VIVIDNESS AND EXTRAORDINARY SEMBLANCE OF REALITY
ON THE EVENING OF A HOLIDAY IT WAS A GREY AND HEAVY DAY THE COUNTRY WAS EXACTLY AS HE REMEMBERED IT INDEED HE RECALLED IT FAR MORE VIVIDLY IN HIS DREAM
DEGRADING IT ALL IS THE OLD WOMAN CAME BACK HERE SIR AS WE SAY TEN COPECKS THE ROUBLE A MONTH
AND THE DRUNKEN MEN WHOM HE MET CONTINUALLY
HE HAD GIVEN UP ATTENDING TO MATTERS OF PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE HE HAD LOST ALL DESIRE TO DO SO
HE HAD NOT FAR TO GO HE KNEW INDEED HOW MANY STEPS IT WAS FROM THE GATE OF HIS LODGING HOUSE EXACTLY SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY HE HAD COUNTED THEM ONCE
THE MOST TRIVIAL DETAIL
UTTERING A NEW WORD IS WHAT THEY FEAR MOST BUT I AM TALKING TOO MUCH
WITH A KIND OF EFFORT HE BEGAN ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM SOME INNER CRAVING TO STARE AT ALL THE OBJECTS BEFORE HIM AS THOUGH LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO DISTRACT HIS ATTENTION
AND IN SPITE OF THE HEAT
WHAT FILTHY THINGS MY HEART IS CAPABLE OF YES FILTHY ABOVE ALL DISGUSTING LOATHSOME LOATHSOME
WHILE HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE OLD WOMAN HAD BY NOW REACHED SUCH A PITCH AND HAD TAKEN SUCH A DEFINITE FORM THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF TO ESCAPE FROM HIS WRETCHEDNESS
BESIDES THE TWO DRUNKEN MEN HE HAD MET ON THE STEPS A GROUP CONSISTING OF ABOUT FIVE MEN AND A GIRL
HAD GONE OUT AT THE SAME TIME THEIR DEPARTURE LEFT THE ROOM QUIET AND RATHER EMPTY THE PERSONS STILL IN THE TAVERN WERE A MAN WHO APPEARED TO BE AN
HE HAD BECOME SO COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HIMSELF AND ISOLATED FROM HIS FELLOWS
QUITE THE CONTRARY BUT FOR SOME TIME PAST HE HAD BEEN IN AN OVERSTRAINED IRRITABLE CONDITION
BUT THE THOUGHT OF GOING HOME SUDDENLY FILLED HIM WITH INTENSE LOATHING IN THAT HOLE IN THAT AWFUL LITTLE CUPBOARD OF HIS ALL THIS HAD FOR A MONTH PAST BEEN GROWING UP IN HIM
WHILE HE HUMMED SOME MEANINGLESS REFRAIN
I AM AGAIN ON THE SAME ERRAND RASKOLNIKOV CONTINUED A LITTLE DISCONCERTED AND SURPRISED AT THE OLD WOMAN'S MISTRUST PERHAPS SHE IS ALWAYS LIKE THAT THOUGH
THAT HIS IDEAS WERE SOMETIMES IN A TANGLE AND THAT HE WAS VERY WEAK FOR TWO DAYS HE HAD SCARCELY TASTED FOOD
THE MIND IS CLEARER AND THE WILL IS FIRM PHEW
WHOM INDEED HE DISLIKED MEETING AT ANY TIME AND YET
THE YOUNG MAN LEFT STANDING ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM LISTENED INQUISITIVELY THINKING HE COULD HEAR HER UNLOCKING THE CHEST OF DRAWERS
A PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCE ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME KIND OF FESTIVITY GOING ON THERE WERE CROWDS OF GAILY DRESSED TOWNSPEOPLE PEASANT WOMEN
BUT NOW HE FELT GIDDY AND WAS TORMENTED BY A BURNING THIRST HE LONGED FOR A DRINK OF COLD BEER AND ATTRIBUTED HIS SUDDEN WEAKNESS TO THE WANT OF FOOD
REPRESENTING GERMAN DAMSELS WITH BIRDS IN THEIR HANDS THAT WAS ALL IN THE CORNER A LIGHT WAS BURNING BEFORE A SMALL IKON
AND FILLED WITH DETAILS SO DELICATE SO UNEXPECTEDLY BUT SO ARTISTICALLY CONSISTENT THAT THE DREAMER WERE HE AN ARTIST LIKE PUSHKIN OR TURGENEV EVEN
A BIG TAVERN WHICH HAD ALWAYS AROUSED IN HIM A FEELING OF AVERSION EVEN OF FEAR WHEN HE WALKED BY IT WITH HIS FATHER THERE WAS ALWAYS A CROWD THERE
THERE WAS NOT A SPECK OF DUST TO BE SEEN IN THE WHOLE FLAT
AT TIMES MONSTROUS IMAGES ARE CREATED
IF HE HAS ANY FARTHINGS
COULD NEVER HAVE INVENTED THEM IN THE WAKING STATE SUCH SICK DREAMS ALWAYS REMAIN LONG IN THE MEMORY AND MAKE A POWERFUL IMPRESSION ON THE OVERWROUGHT AND DERANGED NERVOUS SYSTEM
ON PASSING AN EATING HOUSE OR TAVERN AND FELT THAT HE WAS HUNGRY
AND EAGERLY DRANK OFF THE FIRST GLASSFUL AT ONCE HE FELT EASIER AND HIS THOUGHTS BECAME CLEAR ALL THAT'S NONSENSE HE SAID HOPEFULLY
THAN HE HAD DONE IN MEMORY THE LITTLE TOWN STOOD ON A LEVEL FLAT AS BARE AS THE HAND
AND WAS IN NO HURRY TO GET AWAY AS THOUGH THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING HE WANTED TO SAY OR TO DO
RECALL SOME SUCH LINES AS THESE
AS THOUGH HESITATING THEN STEPPED ON ONE SIDE AND POINTING TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM SHE SAID LETTING HER VISITOR PASS IN FRONT OF HER STEP IN MY GOOD SIR
THESE TWO ROOMS MADE UP THE WHOLE FLAT
WILL BEGIN AFRESH AND SUDDENLY HE REALISED WHAT HE WAS THINKING AFTER IT HE SHOUTED JUMPING UP FROM THE SEAT BUT
HE BROKE OFF IN CONFUSION WELL WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT THEN SIR GOOD BYE ARE YOU ALWAYS AT HOME ALONE YOUR SISTER IS NOT HERE WITH YOU
TWO OR THREE TIMES AS THOUGH SUDDENLY STRUCK BY SOME THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS IN THE STREET HE CRIED OUT OH GOD
THAT ONE FINDS SUCH CLEANLINESS RASKOLNIKOV THOUGHT AGAIN AND HE STOLE A CURIOUS GLANCE AT THE COTTON CURTAIN
WAS THE LITTLE GRAVE OF HIS YOUNGER BROTHER WHO HAD DIED AT SIX MONTHS OLD HE DID NOT REMEMBER HIM AT ALL BUT HE HAD BEEN TOLD ABOUT HIS LITTLE BROTHER
THE OLD WOMAN SAID DISTINCTLY STILL KEEPING HER INQUIRING EYES ON HIS FACE AND HERE
WITH HIS ARMS WIDE APART
AND HE DREW OUT OF HIS POCKET AN OLD FASHIONED FLAT SILVER WATCH ON THE BACK OF WHICH WAS ENGRAVED A GLOBE THE CHAIN WAS OF STEEL BUT THE TIME IS UP FOR YOUR LAST PLEDGE
IF YOU LIKE A ROUBLE AND A HALF CRIED THE YOUNG MAN PLEASE YOURSELF AND THE OLD WOMAN HANDED HIM BACK THE WATCH THE YOUNG MAN TOOK IT
SO I MUST HAVE GIVEN FORTY SEVEN
IN A MOMENT ANOTHER MAN APPEARED AND HE TOO DROPPED INSIDE THE WALL SO MANNING HAD ALREADY SENT THE MEN IN THE MOB WAS UNLEASHED RYNASON HESITATED FOR A MOMENT
IT WAS IN ONE OF THESE MOMENTS OF OBSCURITY THAT SHE OBSERVED A SMALL AND LAMBENT FLAME MOVING AT SOME DISTANCE ON THE TERRACE WHILE SHE GAZED IT DISAPPEARED AND THE MOON AGAIN EMERGING FROM THE LURID AND HEAVY THUNDER CLOUDS
BUT SHE WAS EQUALLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID THE DISPLEASURE OF MADAME CHERON THOUGH HER AFFECTION WOULD NOT SUFFER HER TO QUESTION EVEN A MOMENT THE PROPRIETY OF SAINT AUBERT'S CONDUCT IN APPOINTING MADAME CHERON
THEY AWAKENED SO FORCIBLY THE MEMORY OF FORMER TIMES THAT HER RESOLUTION YIELDED FOR A MOMENT TO EXCESS OF GRIEF SHE STOPPED LEANED FOR SUPPORT AGAINST A TREE AND WEPT FOR SOME MINUTES BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED HERSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO PROCEED
HE DISCONNECTED THIS HIS TORN FINGERS WORKING AWKWARDLY ON THE DELICATE LINKAGES READY MARA WAS JUST INSIDE THE NARROW PASSAGE BEHIND THE ALTAR
IT LASTED FOR LONG SECONDS THEN IT'S YOUR FUNERAL THERE WAS A FAINT CLICK AS MANNING SWITCHED OFF RYNASON STARED ANGRILY AT THE RADIOSET FOR A MOMENT
LET'S GO OUT RYNASON SAID AND THE TWO OF THEM BROKE FROM BEHIND THE ALTAR THE HIRLAJI STOOD COMPLETELY STILL SEVERAL OF THOSE THAT RYNASON HAD DROPPED WITH HIS STUNNER HAD RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS BUT THEY MADE NO MOVE EITHER
A NICE PARABLE MARA SAID WE COULD USE HIM AGAINST THE HIRLAJI THOUGH RYNASON WAS SILENT THINKING IF THEY COULD ONLY CATCH THE ALIENS OFF GUARD
THIS WAS A SCENE THAT EXHIBITED ON HIS PART HIS USUAL INHUMANITY AND ON THAT OF MADAME MONTONI A PERSEVERING SPIRIT CONTENDING WITH A FEEBLE FRAME
THE HIRLAJI STOOD MOTIONLESSLY IN DIMNESS IT TOOK AWHILE FOR RYNASON'S EYES TO ADJUST TO IT HE FOUND THE INTERPRETER THAT MARA HAD LEFT AND QUICKLY HOOKED IT UP TO HORNG
THE ANTIENT ARCH LEADING TO THE EAST RAMPART THE TURRET ABOVE OR THE FORTIFICATIONS BEYOND AND THEN PERHAPS THE WHOLE EDIFICE WITH ALL ITS TOWERS ITS DARK MASSY WALLS AND POINTED CASEMENTS WOULD APPEAR
NOR EVEN FOR SPECIALIZED COMPUTATIONS
AND EMILY WITH A STRENGTH OF MIND THAT REFUSED TO YIELD TO GRIEF WHILE ANY DUTY REQUIRED HER ACTIVITY APPLIED EVERY MEANS THAT SEEMED LIKELY TO RESTORE HER BUT THE LAST STRUGGLE WAS OVER SHE WAS GONE FOR EVER
IN WHICH AFTER SOME COMMON PLACE CONDOLEMENT AND ADVICE SHE INVITED HER TO THOLOUSE AND ADDED THAT AS HER LATE BROTHER HAD ENTRUSTED EMILY'S EDUCATION TO HER
DAMN IT THERE'S NO NEED FOR ANY FIGHTING MANNING'S VOICE SOUNDED COLD EVEN IN THE FAINT RECEPTION OF THE HAND RADIO THAT'S FOR ME TO DECIDE I'M RUNNING THIS SHOW REMEMBER YOU'RE RUNNING A MASSACRE RYNASON SHOUTED
TOO MUCH DISTRESSED TO CONVERSE AFTER SOME TIME HOWEVER SHE ACQUIRED FORTITUDE ENOUGH TO SPEAK OF HER FATHER AND TO GIVE A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH DURING WHICH RECITAL VALANCOURT'S COUNTENANCE BETRAYED STRONG EMOTION
WHEN AMIDST THE UPROAR OF THE STORM SHE THOUGHT SHE HEARD A VOICE AND RAISING HERSELF TO LISTEN SAW THE CHAMBER DOOR OPEN AND ANNETTE ENTER WITH A COUNTENANCE OF WILD AFFRIGHT SHE IS DYING MA'AMSELLE MY LADY IS DYING SAID SHE
SHE HESITATED ONLY A MOMENT THEN HURRIED DOWN THE BROAD LEVELS OF THE TEMPLE STEPS RYNASON WATCHED HER TO THE BOTTOM THEN TURNED AND RE ENTERED THE ALTAR ROOM
SOMEHOW THEY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DEVELOP MORE RAPIDLY THAN WE DID PROBABLY BEFORE THE DARK AGES RYNASON SAID MAYBE THEY DIDN'T SEE THAT THOUSAND YEAR SETBACK COMING HE STOPPED AND STOOD UP IN THE LOW PASSAGEWAY AMONG
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SAID RYNASON
THE LEATHERY GREY WRINKLES WHICH SURROUNDED THOSE EYES QUIVERED SLIGHTLY BUT OTHERWISE HE MADE NO MOVEMENT RYNASON DROPPED HIS GAZE FROM THAT CONTACT AND WRESTED THE WEAPON AWAY
DARTING FROM WALL TO WALL IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS OF EVENING
BUT OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T NOW HE LET HIS EYES WANDER AIMLESSLY ALONG THE CIRCUITRY SURROUNDING THEM TELL ME OLD KOR WHAT DO WE DO NOW AFTER A MOMENT HIS EYES NARROWED
CAN MUSIC'S VOICE CAN BEAUTY'S EYE CAN PAINTING'S GLOWING HAND SUPPLY A CHARM SO SUITED TO MY MIND AS BLOWS THIS HOLLOW GUST OF WIND AS DROPS THIS LITTLE WEEPING RILL
WHEN SHE BEGGED IN A FEEBLE VOICE THAT SHE WOULD NOT LEAVE HER THE VISIT OF MONTONI WAS NOT TO SOOTH HIS WIFE WHOM HE KNEW TO BE DYING OR TO CONSOLE OR TO ASK HER FORGIVENESS
EMILY FOUND MADAME MONTONI NEARLY IN THE SAME CONDITION AS ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT SHE HAD SLEPT LITTLE AND THAT LITTLE HAD NOT REFRESHED HER SHE SMILED ON HER NIECE AND SEEMED CHEERED BY HER PRESENCE BUT SPOKE ONLY A FEW WORDS
ABOUT THE OTHER RACE THAT THEY WOULD MEET SOMEDAY THAT WAS BASED ON OUTSIDERS OBSERVATIONS I WONDER WHEN THE OUTSIDERS WERE ON EARTH RYNASON SAID SOMETIME AFTER WE'D STARTED OUR OWN RISE CERTAINLY
MAKE IT FAST MANNING SAID HIS VOICE SOUNDED UNINTERESTED IF ANY OF YOUR BOYS TRY TO COME IN I'LL STOP THEM MYSELF I'VE GOT THE DISINTEGRATORS AND I'LL USE THEM THERE WAS SILENCE FROM THE RADIO SAVE FOR THE STATIC
FOR HER GUARDIAN SHE WAS SENSIBLE THAT THIS STEP HAD MADE HER HAPPINESS DEPEND IN A GREAT DEGREE ON THE HUMOUR OF HER AUNT IN HER REPLY SHE BEGGED PERMISSION TO REMAIN AT PRESENT AT LA VALLEE
IT HAD MEANT SOMETHING ELSE THEN BUT THE PROTO LANGUAGE OF THE HIRLAJI HAD NO PRECISE MEANINGS GIVEN BY ITSELF
TO WATCH THE FLOWERS HIS HAND HAD PLANTED TO AWAKEN THE TONES OF THAT INSTRUMENT HIS FINGERS HAD PRESSED AND SOMETIMES EVEN TO PLAY HIS FAVOURITE AIR WHEN HER MIND HAD RECOVERED FROM THE FIRST SHOCK OF AFFLICTION
EMILY AT THIS TIME
RYNASON AND THE GIRL RAN RIGHT THROUGH THE QUIET ALIENS ONLY A FEW OF THEM TURNED SHADOWED EYES TO LOOK AT THEM AS THEY PASSED THEY MADE THE OUTSIDE COLONNADE IN SAFETY AND PAUSED THERE
THE ANCIENT CIRCUITRY SO HERE WE ARE SECOND GUESSING THE OUTSIDERS AND OUTSIDE THEIR PROTEGES HAVE DISINTEGRATORS PROBABLY LEFT BY THE OUTSIDERS
THAT IT MIGHT BE HE WHO HAD OCCASIONED SO MUCH ALARM ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT THERE WERE HOWEVER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES THAT STILL REQUIRED EXPLANATION AS FAR AS SHE COULD JUDGE BY THE FAINT MOON LIGHT THAT HAD ASSISTED HER OBSERVATION
LIGHTED UP WITH STILL MORE THAN ITS USUAL ANIMATION A THOUSAND PAINFUL RECOLLECTIONS CROWDED TO HER MIND AND THE EFFORT WHICH SHE MADE TO SUPPORT HERSELF ONLY SERVED TO INCREASE HER AGITATION
AND RYNASON KNEW THAT THESE MEN WOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO ATTACK IN THE DARK HE WARMED THE RADIO AND OPENED THE TRANSMITTER MANNING CALL OFF YOUR DOGS I'VE DISARMED THE HIRLAJI THE RADIO SPAT STATIC AT HIM
FOR I SHALL NEVER MEET WITH HIS RESEMBLANCE IF I COULD HAVE FOUND SUCH A MAN IN WHAT IS CALLED SOCIETY I SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT IT
AND IT WAS NOW THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE FULL VALUE OF THE EDUCATION SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM SAINT AUBERT FOR IN CULTIVATING HER UNDERSTANDING HE HAD SECURED HER AN ASYLUM FROM INDOLENCE WITHOUT RECOURSE TO DISSIPATION
EMILY REMAINED AT HER CASEMENT TILL THE VIVID LIGHTNING THAT NOW EVERY INSTANT REVEALED THE WIDE HORIZON AND THE LANDSCAPE BELOW MADE IT NO LONGER SAFE TO DO SO
TILL IT WAS WET WITH THE TEARS WHICH GRIEF FOR SAINT AUBERT AND SYMPATHY FOR HERSELF HAD CALLED FORTH I FEEL SAID HE AT LENGTH
LEAVING HER LAMP IN A REMOTE PART OF THE CHAMBER THAT SHE MIGHT ESCAPE NOTICE FROM WITHOUT THE MOON GAVE A FAINT AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT FOR HEAVY VAPOURS SURROUNDED IT AND OFTEN ROLLING OVER THE DISK LEFT THE SCENE BELOW IN TOTAL DARKNESS
THE HIRLAJI ARE APPARENTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING IT PROTECTED SINCE THEN BUT WHY SHOULD THE HIRLAJI BE ABLE TO USE IT
MONTONI HOWEVER DID NOT LEAVE THE ROOM TILL HIS WIFE EXHAUSTED BY THE OBSTINATE DISPUTE HAD FAINTED AND SHE LAY SO LONG INSENSIBLE THAT EMILY BEGAN TO FEAR THAT THE SPARK OF LIFE WAS EXTINGUISHED AT LENGTH SHE REVIVED
WELL I'M NOT SO SURE YOU EVER CAME OUT OF IT YOU'RE STILL ONE OF THEM IS THAT THE ONLY REASON YOU CAN THINK OF THAT I MIGHT HAVE FOR WANTING TO PREVENT A MASSACRE RYNASON SAID ICILY
BUT IN THE NEXT MOMENT RECOLLECTED HIMSELF FOR HE IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE MENTION OF HER FATHER TILL PERCEIVING THAT HER SPIRITS WERE EXHAUSTED HE GRADUALLY CHANGED THE SUBJECT AND SPOKE OF HIMSELF
IT MOVED AWAY AND THEN BY A GLEAM OF LIGHTNING SHE PERCEIVED SOME PERSON ON THE TERRACE ALL THE ANXIETIES OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT RETURNED THIS PERSON ADVANCED
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LEE MY BOY YOU'RE SOUNDING LIKE AN OLD HORSEFACED NURSEMAID YOU LINKED MINDS WITH THEM AND YOU SAY YOU WERE PRACTICALLY A HIRLAJI YOURSELF WHEN YOU WENT INTO THAT LINKAGE
I AM BUT LATELY COME TO THE CASTLE FOR I HAVE NOT BEEN LONG A SOLDIER HOW DOES YOUR COMRADE ACCOUNT FOR IT SAID EMILY HE SAYS IT IS AN OMEN LADY AND BODES NO GOOD AND WHAT HARM CAN IT BODE REJOINED EMILY
UNCONSCIOUS OF THE GLOOM OF EVENING AND THAT THE SUN'S LAST LIGHT TREMBLED ON THE HEIGHTS ABOVE AND WOULD PROBABLY HAVE REMAINED SO MUCH LONGER IF A SUDDEN FOOTSTEP WITHOUT THE BUILDING HAD NOT ALARMED HER ATTENTION
LEFT THE MACHINE WHEN THEY PULLED OUT BUT THEY SET IT TO RESPOND TO THE HIRLAJI LANGUAGE BECAUSE OUR HORSEFACED FRIENDS WERE BEGINNING TO BUILD A CIVILIZATION OF THEIR OWN AND THE OUTSIDERS THOUGHT THEY'D LEAVE THEM SOME GUIDANCE
I WONDERED MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE WHAT WAS THE REASON MY LADY DID NOT SEEM FRIGHTENED AT THE THUNDER WHEN I WAS SO TERRIFIED AND I WENT OFTEN TO THE BED TO SPEAK TO HER BUT SHE APPEARED TO BE ASLEEP TILL PRESENTLY I HEARD A STRANGE NOISE AND ON GOING TO HER
AND HER MIND HAD NOW SO FAR RECOVERED ITS STRENGTH THAT SHE VENTURED TO VIEW THE SCENES WHICH MOST POWERFULLY RECALLED THE IMAGES OF PAST TIMES AMONG THESE WAS THE FISHING HOUSE AND TO INDULGE STILL MORE THE AFFECTIONATE MELANCHOLY OF THE VISIT
RYNASON WENT QUICKLY AMONG THEM TAKING THEIR WEAPONS MOST OF THEM MADE NO EFFORT TO STOP HIM BUT A FEW TIGHTENED THEIR GRIPS ON THE DISINTEGRATORS AND HE HAD TO PRY THOSE THICK FINGERS FROM THE WEAPONS CURSING TO HIMSELF
HE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT REMEMBERING THAT FIRST LINKAGE WITH HORNG AND TEBRON'S MEMORIES THE HIRLAJI CALLED THEM THE OLD ONES HE SAID AND THAT ORDER TO TEBRON
I COMMEND YOUR PRUDENCE SAID EMILY GOOD NIGHT AND ACCEPT THIS FROM ME SHE ADDED THROWING HIM A SMALL PIECE OF COIN AND THEN CLOSING THE CASEMENT TO PUT AN END TO THE DISCOURSE WHEN HE WAS GONE
AND FOR SEVERAL SECONDS HE THOUGHT HIS SIGNAL HADN'T EVEN BEEN PICKED UP BUT AT LAST THERE WAS A REPLY THEN GET OUT OF THE TEMPLE IT'S TOO LATE TO STOP THIS MANNING I SAID GET CLEAR
EMILY THUS LEARNED THAT AFTER THEY HAD PARTED HE HAD WANDERED FOR SOME TIME ALONG THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND HAD THEN RETURNED THROUGH LANGUEDOC INTO GASCONY
A BENEVOLENCE THAT TAUGHT HER TO FEEL FOR ALL THAT COULD SUFFER MADAME CHERON RETURNED NO ANSWER TO EMILY'S LETTER WHO BEGAN TO HOPE THAT SHE SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO REMAIN SOME TIME LONGER IN HER RETIREMENT
SHE TURNED HER ATTENTION TO THE HEAVENS WHERE THE VIVID LIGHTNINGS DARTED FROM CLOUD TO CLOUD AND FLASHED SILENTLY ON THE WOODS BELOW SHE LOVED TO CATCH IN THE MOMENTARY GLEAM THE GLOOMY LANDSCAPE
SHE TOOK THITHER HER LUTE THAT SHE MIGHT AGAIN HEAR THERE THE TONES TO WHICH SAINT AUBERT AND HER MOTHER HAD SO OFTEN DELIGHTED TO LISTEN SHE WENT ALONE AND AT THAT STILL HOUR OF THE EVENING WHICH IS SO SOOTHING TO FANCY AND TO GRIEF
AND NEVER NAMED MONTONI WHO HOWEVER SOON AFTER ENTERED THE ROOM HIS WIFE WHEN SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS THERE APPEARED MUCH AGITATED BUT WAS ENTIRELY SILENT TILL EMILY ROSE FROM A CHAIR AT THE BED SIDE
HOW LONG WOULD THEY WAIT THERE WERE FOURTEEN OF THE DISINTEGRATORS THEY WERE LARGE AND HEAVY
I FEEL HOW INSUFFICIENT ALL ATTEMPT AT CONSOLATION MUST BE ON THIS SUBJECT I CAN ONLY MOURN WITH YOU FOR I CANNOT DOUBT THE SOURCE OF YOUR TEARS WOULD TO GOD I WERE MISTAKEN
WHEN HE STOPPED AS IF HE HAD KNOWN THIS TO BE THE LIMIT OF HIS WALK HERE SAYING THAT IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO ESTUVIERE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD PERMIT HIM TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER IN THE MORNING
SHE REMEMBERED PARTICULARLY THE EARNEST AND SOLEMN MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD REQUIRED HER TO DESTROY THE MANUSCRIPT PAPERS AND AWAKENING FROM THE LETHARGY IN WHICH SORROW HAD HELD HER SHE WAS SHOCKED TO THINK SHE HAD NOT YET OBEYED HIM
WHILE EMILY REPEATEDLY DECLARED TO HIM HER WILLINGNESS TO RESIGN ALL CLAIM TO THOSE ESTATES RATHER THAN THAT THE LAST HOURS OF HER AUNT SHOULD BE DISTURBED BY CONTENTION
EMILY COULD STILL ANSWER ONLY BY TEARS TILL SHE ROSE AND BEGGED THEY MIGHT LEAVE THE MELANCHOLY SPOT WHEN VALANCOURT THOUGH HE SAW HER FEEBLENESS COULD NOT OFFER TO DETAIN HER
LEARNED FROM THE FLOOD OF TEARS WHICH SHE COULD NO LONGER REPRESS THE FATAL TRUTH HE LED HER TO A SEAT AND SAT DOWN BY HER WHILE EMILY CONTINUED TO WEEP AND VALANCOURT TO HOLD THE HAND WHICH SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS HE HAD TAKEN
THAT BOWED UPON THE BANKS BELOW WAS A KIND OF MUSIC MORE IN UNISON WITH HER FEELINGS IT DID NOT VIBRATE ON THE CHORDS OF UNHAPPY MEMORY BUT WAS SOOTHING TO THE HEART AS THE VOICE OF PITY SHE CONTINUED TO MUSE
SEVERAL WEEKS PASSED AWAY IN QUIET RETIREMENT AND EMILY'S AFFLICTION BEGAN TO SOFTEN INTO MELANCHOLY SHE COULD BEAR TO READ THE BOOKS SHE HAD BEFORE READ WITH HER FATHER TO SIT IN HIS CHAIR IN THE LIBRARY
THAT'S ONLY A MACHINE I SPOKE THROUGH IT MYSELF MINUTES AGO DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT AFTER A MOMENT HORNG'S EYES SLOWLY CLOSED AND OPENED IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT KOR WAS GOD KNOWLEDGE
I WANT TO HELP YOU FIGHT THEM OFF THERE WAS NO REACTION FROM THE ALIEN ONLY THOSE QUIET EYES RESTING ON HIM LIKE THE SHADOWS OF THE ENTIRE PAST CAN YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT KOR IS A GOD
SAINT AUBERT HAVING NOURISHED EVERY AMIABLE QUALIFY OF HER HEART IT NOW EXPANDED IN BENEVOLENCE TO ALL AROUND HER AND TAUGHT HER WHEN SHE COULD NOT REMOVE THE MISFORTUNES OF OTHERS AT LEAST TO SOFTEN THEM BY SYMPATHY AND TENDERNESS
MANNING I'M SWITCHING OFF NOT QUITE YET
HE KNOWS NOT SO MUCH AS THAT LADY WHETHER EMILY WAS ALARMED BY THIS OMEN OR NOT SHE CERTAINLY WAS RELIEVED FROM MUCH TERROR BY DISCOVERING THIS MAN TO BE ONLY A SOLDIER ON DUTY
HOW WELL COULD THEY COMMUNICATE IN SUCH A LANGUAGE NOT VERY WELL RYNASON SAID WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THE MACHINE SEEMED TO MAKE MISTAKES CLUMSINESS OF LANGUAGE SO THE OUTSIDERS MAYBE
SHE FELT SOMEWHAT MORE AT EASE IN THE FIRST DAYS OF HER AFFLICTION SHE WAS VISITED BY MONSIEUR BARREAUX A SINCERE MOURNER FOR SAINT AUBERT I MAY WELL LAMENT MY FRIEND SAID HE
PERCEIVING THE DANGER OF YIELDING TO INDOLENCE AND THAT ACTIVITY ALONE COULD RESTORE ITS TONE SHE SCRUPULOUSLY ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ALL HER HOURS IN EMPLOYMENT
DURING WHICH THE RETROSPECT OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE SHE HAD SEEN VALANCOURT WOULD RISE TO HER IMAGINATION AND THE SCENE OF HER FATHER'S DEATH APPEARED IN TINTS AS FRESH AS IF IT HAD PASSED ON THE PRECEDING DAY
THAT RAISED ANOTHER PROBLEM RYNASON MUSED THE OUTSIDERS BUILT IT AND MUST HAVE LEFT IT HERE WHEN THEY PULLED BACK TO WHEREVER THEY WERE GOING IF THEY EVER LEFT THE PLANET BUT THE HIRLAJI USE IT AND THEY COMMUNICATE WITH IT VERBALLY
THERE IS ONE WITHIN BESIDES THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD AND SEEN RECOUNTS MOST HORRID SIGHTS SEEN BY THE WATCH JULIUS CAESAR IN THE MORNING
OUR NEW FOUND KNOWLEDGE ISN'T DOING US MUCH GOOD IS IT SHE SAID HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SLOWLY WHEN I WAS STILL ON THE SECONDARY SENSETEACH UNITS I MET RENE MALHOMME FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND EMILY PERCEIVING THAT SHE COULD NOT REJECT AN ORDINARY CIVILITY WITHOUT EXPRESSING BY HER REFUSAL AN EXPECTATION OF SOMETHING MORE WAS COMPELLED TO ANSWER THAT SHE SHOULD BE AT HOME SHE PASSED A MELANCHOLY EVENING
THE OLD ONES DIED BEFORE TIME AND PASSED INTO KOR NOW KOR IS DEAD AND ALL OF YOU WILL BE DEAD TOO RYNASON SAID THE HUGE ALIEN SAT UNMOVING
WERE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MYSTERIOUS IMPORT THAT DID NOT APPLY WITH PROBABILITY TO A SOLDIER ENGAGED IN THE DUTY OF HIS GUARD SHE NOW ENQUIRED OF THE SENTINEL WHETHER HE HAD SEEN ANY PERSON BESIDES HIS FELLOW WATCH
THESE SHE KNEW WERE NOT TO BE FOUND AT MADAME CHERON'S WHOSE INCLINATIONS LED HER INTO A LIFE OF DISSIPATION WHICH HER AMPLE FORTUNE ENCOURAGED AND HAVING GIVEN HER ANSWER
BUT RYNASON HAD SEEN THIS PART OF SUCH MACHINES BEFORE HE FOUND THE PENULTIMATE POINT AT WHICH THE IMPULSES FROM THE BRAIN WERE TRANSLATED INTO SOUND AND BROADCAST THROUGH THE SPEAKER
AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT SAINT AUBERT HAD DIED ON THE ROAD AND THAT EMILY HAD BEEN LEFT AMONG STRANGERS HE PRESSED HER HAND BETWEEN HIS AND INVOLUNTARILY EXCLAIMED WHY WAS I NOT THERE
AND BEING SOMEWHAT RESTORED BY A CORDIAL CONVERSED FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME ON THE SUBJECT OF HER ESTATES IN FRANCE WITH CLEARNESS AND PRECISION SHE DIRECTED HER NIECE WHERE TO FIND SOME PAPERS RELATIVE TO THEM WHICH SHE HAD HITHERTO CONCEALED FROM THE SEARCH OF MONTONI
SURELY I AM NOT MISTAKEN MA'AMSELLE SAINT AUBERT IS IT NOT IT IS INDEED SAID EMILY WHO WAS CONFIRMED IN HER FIRST CONJECTURE FOR SHE NOW DISTINGUISHED THE COUNTENANCE OF VALANCOURT
HE TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE'D BEEN YOUNGER HE'D WORKED HIS WAY ALL THE WAY IN TO EARTH AND STUDIED SOME OF THE CULTURES THERE HE'D LEARNED KARATE WHICH WAS AN ANCIENT JAPANESE WAY OF FIGHTING
I'VE GOT THESE MEN FOLLOWING ME AND I'LL LISTEN TO WHAT THEY WANT RYNASON STARED AT THE MICROPHONE FOR A MOMENT ARE YOU SURE YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF YOUR OWN MOB HE SAID WE'RE COMING IN LEE
RYNASON TOOK A DEEP BREATH HE SAID EVERYTHING A PERSON LEARNS WILL BE USEFUL SOMEDAY AND I BELIEVED HIM
REVERBED BY THE MOUNTAINS OTHER THUNDER SEEMED TO ANSWER FROM THE OPPOSITE HORIZON WHILE THE ACCUMULATING CLOUDS ENTIRELY CONCEALING THE MOON ASSUMED A RED SULPHUREOUS TINGE THAT FORETOLD A VIOLENT STORM
BY THE BODY OF HER DECEASED AUNT DURING THIS SOLEMN PERIOD RENDERED MORE AWFUL BY THE TREMENDOUS STORM THAT SHOOK THE AIR SHE FREQUENTLY ADDRESSED HERSELF TO HEAVEN FOR SUPPORT AND PROTECTION
BUT WHAT IT MEANS I CANNOT TELL THIS IS VERY STRANGE SAID EMILY MY FELLOW GUARD CONTINUED THE MAN HAS THE SAME FLAME ON HIS ARMS HE SAYS HE HAS SOMETIMES SEEN IT BEFORE I NEVER DID
THERE ARE AMONGST US WHO BELIEVE STRANGE THINGS STRANGE STORIES TOO HAVE LONG BEEN TOLD OF THIS CASTLE BUT IT IS NO BUSINESS OF MINE TO REPEAT THEM AND FOR MY PART I HAVE NO REASON TO COMPLAIN OUR CHIEF DOES NOBLY BY US
BUT IT WASN'T HALF THE SIZE OF THIS AND NAVIGATION BETWEEN STARS EVEN WITH THE KIND OF DRIVE THEY MUST HAVE HAD IS NO SIMPLE PROBLEM THE HIRLAJI THINK IT'S A GOD SHE SAID
TILL LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT AND EVEN THEN WOULD NOT HAVE QUITTED THE ROOM HAD NOT HER AUNT ENTREATED THAT SHE WOULD RETIRE TO REST SHE THEN OBEYED THE MORE WILLINGLY BECAUSE HER PATIENT APPEARED SOMEWHAT RECRUITED BY SLEEP AND GIVING ANNETTE THE SAME INJUNCTION AS ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT
MY FATHER WORKED THE SPACERS SO I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT PLANET THIS WAS ON BUT I REMEMBER THE NIGHT I FIRST SAW RENE
THEN TURNED AND WENT QUICKLY BACK INTO THE ALTAR ROOM MARA'S RADIO WAS THERE HE LIFTED IT BY ITS STRAP AND TOOK IT WITH HIM OUT TO THE COLONNADE HE COULD SEE THE EARTHMEN MOVING THROUGH THE STREETS NOW
AS HE STARTED TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT HORNG SILENTLY DIPPED HIS MASSIVE HEAD TO ONE SIDE RYNASON FELT A CHILL GO DOWN HIS BACK IN A FEW MORE MINUTES HE HAD DISARMED THEM ALL
BUT TOOK HER ARM WITHIN HIS AND LED HER FROM THE FISHING HOUSE THEY WALKED SILENTLY THROUGH THE WOODS VALANCOURT ANXIOUS TO KNOW YET FEARING TO ASK ANY PARTICULARS CONCERNING SAINT AUBERT AND EMILY
AND SHE FAINTLY DEMANDED WHO PASSED A FRIEND REPLIED A VOICE WHAT FRIEND SAID EMILY SOMEWHAT ENCOURAGED WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IS THAT LIGHT YOU CARRY I AM ANTHONIO
AND WHAT IS THAT TAPERING LIGHT YOU BEAR SAID EMILY SEE HOW IT DARTS UPWARDS AND NOW IT VANISHES THIS LIGHT LADY SAID THE SOLDIER HAS APPEARED TO NIGHT AS YOU SEE IT ON THE POINT OF MY LANCE EVER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON WATCH
AFTER SOME DELIBERATION SHE DETERMINED THAT MONTONI SHOULD NOT BE INFORMED OF THIS EVENT TILL THE MORNING FOR SHE CONSIDERED THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS UTTER SOME INHUMAN EXPRESSIONS
THE LITTLE PATH THAT LED TO THE BUILDING WAS OVERGROWN WITH GRASS AND THE FLOWERS WHICH SAINT AUBERT HAD SCATTERED CARELESSLY ALONG THE BORDER WERE ALMOST CHOKED WITH WEEDS THE TALL THISTLE THE FOX GLOVE AND THE NETTLE
AT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE LOST HER FEAR IN A STRONGER EMOTION ITS TONES WERE FAMILIAR TO HER EAR AND THOUGH SHE COULD NOT READILY DISTINGUISH THROUGH THE DUSK THE FEATURES OF THE PERSON WHO SPOKE
AS THE LATE RESIDENCE OF THOSE WHOM SHE HAD LOST FOR EVER WHERE SHE COULD WEEP UNOBSERVED RETRACE THEIR STEPS AND REMEMBER EACH MINUTE PARTICULAR OF THEIR MANNERS
HIS EYES TURNED AWAY FROM RYNASON YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT THEM RYNASON SAID
CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE MARA SAYS THEY WEREN'T SO DOCILE WHEN YOU BROKE IN RYNASON'S MIND RACED HE HAD TO STALL FOR TIME IF HE COULD GET MANNING TO STOP THOSE MEN UNTIL THEY COOLED DOWN
EMILY STARTED UP AND RAN TO MADAME MONTONI'S ROOM WHEN SHE ENTERED HER AUNT APPEARED TO HAVE FAINTED FOR SHE WAS QUITE STILL AND INSENSIBLE
WHICH WAS HIS NATIVE PROVINCE AND WHERE HE USUALLY RESIDED WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED HIS LITTLE NARRATIVE HE SUNK INTO A SILENCE WHICH EMILY WAS NOT DISPOSED TO INTERRUPT AND IT CONTINUED TILL THEY REACHED THE GATE OF THE CHATEAU
IT WAS NOW THE SECOND WATCH OF THE NIGHT AND ABOUT THE TIME WHEN THE FIGURE HAD BEFORE APPEARED EMILY HEARD THE PASSING STEPS OF THE SENTINELS ON THE RAMPART AS THEY CHANGED GUARD AND WHEN ALL WAS AGAIN SILENT
