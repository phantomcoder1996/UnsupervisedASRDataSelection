SHE BEGAN TO CURL HER HAIR AND LONG FOR BALLS HER COMPLEXION IMPROVED HER FEATURES WERE SOFTENED BY PLUMPNESS AND COLOUR HER EYES GAINED MORE ANIMATION AND HER FIGURE MORE CONSEQUENCE
HAD ACCIDENTALLY INQUIRED OF THORPE IF HE KNEW MORE OF HER THAN HER NAME THORPE MOST HAPPY TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A MAN OF GENERAL TILNEY'S IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN JOYFULLY AND PROUDLY COMMUNICATIVE
JOHN THORPE HAD FIRST MISLED HIM THE GENERAL PERCEIVING HIS SON ONE NIGHT AT THE THEATRE TO BE PAYING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO MISS MORLAND
THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM AT NORTHANGER HAD BEEN OF THE MOST UNFRIENDLY KIND HENRY'S INDIGNATION ON HEARING HOW CATHERINE HAD BEEN TREATED ON COMPREHENDING HIS FATHER'S VIEWS AND BEING ORDERED TO ACQUIESCE IN THEM
AND HIS OWN VIEWS ON ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH HE BOASTED WITH ALMOST EQUAL OPENNESS SEEMED SUFFICIENT VOUCHERS FOR HIS TRUTH AND TO THESE WERE ADDED THE ABSOLUTE FACTS OF THE ALLENS BEING WEALTHY AND CHILDLESS
NOTHING TO LAY TO HER CHARGE BUT HER BEING THE INVOLUNTARY UNCONSCIOUS OBJECT OF A DECEPTION WHICH HIS PRIDE COULD NOT PARDON AND WHICH A BETTER PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO OWN
HER ABILITIES WERE QUITE AS EXTRAORDINARY SHE NEVER COULD LEARN OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BEFORE SHE WAS TAUGHT AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THEN FOR SHE WAS OFTEN INATTENTIVE AND OCCASIONALLY STUPID
OF MISS MORLAND'S BEING UNDER THEIR CARE AND AS SOON AS HIS ACQUAINTANCE ALLOWED HIM TO JUDGE OF THEIR TREATING HER WITH PARENTAL KINDNESS HIS RESOLUTION WAS SOON FORMED
THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACK
CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
IN WHAT POINTS HIS OWN CONJECTURES MIGHT ASSIST HIM AND WHAT PORTION MUST YET REMAIN TO BE TOLD IN A LETTER FROM JAMES
SHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEM
I LEAVE IT TO MY READER'S SAGACITY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF ALL THIS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HENRY TO COMMUNICATE AT THIS TIME TO CATHERINE HOW MUCH OF IT HE COULD HAVE LEARNT FROM HIS FATHER
AND RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO BOOKS OR AT LEAST BOOKS OF INFORMATION FOR PROVIDED THAT NOTHING LIKE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE COULD BE GAINED FROM THEM PROVIDED THEY WERE ALL STORY AND NO REFLECTION
THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY WHO WAS SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND
ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOILT FOR HOME BY GREAT ACQUAINTANCE THE MIRROR I THINK I WILL LOOK IT OUT FOR YOU SOME DAY OR OTHER BECAUSE I AM SURE IT WILL DO YOU GOOD CATHERINE SAID NO MORE AND WITH AN ENDEAVOUR TO DO RIGHT
FOR AFTER COMING EAGERLY FORWARD ON THE FIRST OVERTURE OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WITH THE MOST LIBERAL PROPOSALS HE HAD ON BEING BROUGHT TO THE POINT BY THE SHREWDNESS OF THE RELATOR
UPON SUCH INTELLIGENCE THE GENERAL HAD PROCEEDED FOR NEVER HAD IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO DOUBT ITS AUTHORITY THORPE'S INTEREST IN THE FAMILY BY HIS SISTER'S APPROACHING CONNECTION WITH ONE OF ITS MEMBERS
MISSUS MORLAND HAD VERY EARLY DISPATCHED ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO SUMMON HIM BUT MISTER MORLAND WAS FROM HOME AND BEING THUS WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
THAN A BEAUTY FROM HER CRADLE CAN EVER RECEIVE MISSUS MORLAND WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN AND WISHED TO SEE HER CHILDREN EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE BUT HER TIME WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED IN LYING IN AND TEACHING THE LITTLE ONES
CATHERINE AT ANY RATE HEARD ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT IN SUSPECTING GENERAL TILNEY OF EITHER MURDERING OR SHUTTING UP HIS WIFE SHE HAD SCARCELY SINNED AGAINST HIS CHARACTER OR MAGNIFIED HIS CRUELTY
HIS VANITY INDUCED HIM TO REPRESENT THE FAMILY AS YET MORE WEALTHY THAN HIS VANITY AND AVARICE HAD MADE HIM BELIEVE THEM WITH WHOMSOEVER HE WAS OR WAS LIKELY TO BE CONNECTED
THE CREDIT OF A WILD IMAGINATION WILL AT LEAST BE ALL MY OWN A VERY SHORT VISIT TO MISSUS ALLEN IN WHICH HENRY TALKED AT RANDOM WITHOUT SENSE OR CONNECTION AND CATHERINE
WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER AS MISTER HENRY TILNEY WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY
BEEN CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF GIVING THE YOUNG PEOPLE EVEN A DECENT SUPPORT THEY WERE IN FACT A NECESSITOUS FAMILY NUMEROUS TOO ALMOST BEYOND EXAMPLE BY NO MEANS RESPECTED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
THAT THEY WERE FALSE THE GENERAL HAD LEARNT FROM THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD SUGGESTED THEM FROM THORPE HIMSELF WHOM HE HAD CHANCED TO MEET AGAIN IN TOWN AND WHO UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXACTLY OPPOSITE FEELINGS
WITHOUT HAVING SEEN ONE AMIABLE YOUTH WHO COULD CALL FORTH HER SENSIBILITY WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED ONE REAL PASSION AND WITHOUT HAVING EXCITED EVEN ANY ADMIRATION BUT WHAT WAS VERY MODERATE AND VERY TRANSIENT
CHAPTER THIRTY CATHERINE'S DISPOSITION WAS NOT NATURALLY SEDENTARY NOR HAD HER HABITS BEEN EVER VERY INDUSTRIOUS BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HITHERTO HAVE BEEN HER DEFECTS OF THAT SORT
JUDITH CHAPTER FIVE
AND TO THE HOUSE OF NASSAU THE NAVAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED PROVINCES WAS CONDUCTED BY FIVE DISTINCT BOARDS OF ADMIRALTY ONE OF THOSE BOARDS SATE AT AMSTERDAM WAS PARTLY NOMINATED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THAT CITY
WHEN GREY REPEATED WITH APPROBATION WHAT WILDMAN HAD SAID ABOUT RICHMOND AND RICHARD THE WELL READ AND THOUGHTFUL SCOT JUSTLY REMARKED THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND THE SEVENTEENTH
ENCOURAGING MESSAGES REACHED HIM IN QUICK SUCCESSION FROM LONDON HE WAS ASSURED THAT THE VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH THE ELECTIONS HAD BEEN CARRIED ON HAD DRIVEN THE NATION MAD
RICHMOND WAS ASSURED OF THE SUPPORT OF BARONS EACH OF WHOM COULD BRING AN ARMY OF FEUDAL RETAINERS INTO THE FIELD
WITH THE CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN AND ARCHERS
A CHIEF OBJECT OF THE EXPEDITION WAS DECLARED TO BE THE ENTIRE SUPPRESSION
LET US GO UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND WHEN THE BRAVEST OF THEM SHALL BE TAKEN
DEPARTED FROM THE COURSE WHICH THEY ORDINARILY OBSERVED IN THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH HE MADE HIS APPLICATION TO THEM AN ORDER DRAWN IN EXACT CONFORMITY WITH HIS REQUEST
AND THEY CAME BY THE HILLSIDE TO THE TOP WHICH LOOKETH TOWARD DOTHAIN FROM THE PLACE WHICH IS CALLED BELMA UNTO CHELMON
BUT THE CASE WAS ONE WHICH REQUIRED RAPID AND VIGOROUS ACTION AND THE NATURE OF THE BATAVIAN INSTITUTIONS MADE SUCH ACTION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THE UNION OF UTRECHT
FROM THE DIFFERENT PLACES WHEREIN THEY WERE SCATTERED THEY ARE COME TOGETHER
THE HERDSMEN AND FISHERMEN WERE INDEED READY TO RALLY ROUND MAC CALLUM MORE BUT OF THE HEADS OF THE CLAN SOME WERE IN CONFINEMENT AND OTHERS HAD FLED THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO REMAINED AT THEIR HOMES WERE EITHER WELL AFFECTED TO THE GOVERNMENT
WHICH THAT UNION HAD BOUND TOGETHER RETAINED ALMOST ALL THE RIGHTS OF SOVEREIGNTY AND ASSERTED THOSE RIGHTS PUNCTILIOUSLY AGAINST THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
THERE WAS THEREFORE AT THE HAGUE AN EXTREME ANXIETY TO AVOID ALL THAT COULD GIVE HIM OFFENCE THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF WILLIAM WAS ALSO ON THIS OCCASION IDENTICAL WITH THE INTEREST OF HIS FATHER IN LAW
IN THIS PAPER WERE SET FORTH WITH A STRENGTH OF LANGUAGE SOMETIMES APPROACHING TO SCURRILITY MANY REAL AND SOME IMAGINARY GRIEVANCES IT WAS HINTED THAT THE LATE KING HAD DIED BY POISON
NABUCHODONOSOR THE KING CALLED HOLOFERNES
LOCKE WAS TRAVELLING ON THE CONTINENT FOR HIS HEALTH WHEN HE LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF HIS HOME AND OF HIS BREAD WITHOUT A TRIAL OR EVEN A NOTICE
AND STRIPPED THEM OF ALL THEIR RICHES AND ALL THAT RESISTED HIM
WE CANNOT RESIST THEM BECAUSE THEIR GOD WILL DEFEND THEM
AND BESIDES HIM THERE IS NO OTHER JUDITH CHAPTER SIX
AND HE WENT UP TO ALL THEIR CASTLES
OR AFRAID OF MOVING AND REFUSED EVEN TO SEE THE SON OF THEIR CHIEF FROM DUNSTAFFNAGE THE SMALL ARMAMENT PROCEEDED TO CAMPBELLTOWN NEAR THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE PENINSULA OF KINTYRE
AND STAYED THERE FOR THIRTY DAYS
AND ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE SECOND OF MAY HE STOOD OUT TO SEA BEFORE A FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VOYAGE WAS PROSPEROUS ON THE SIXTH THE ORKNEYS WERE IN SIGHT ARGYLE VERY UNWISELY ANCHORED OFF KIRKWALL
AND THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY REAL WISH AT THE STADTHOUSE OF AMSTERDAM TO PREVENT ARGYLE FROM SAILING NO DIFFICULTIES WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE SKELTON NOW ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE STATES GENERAL THEY SHOWED EVERY DISPOSITION TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMAND
SOME OF THE SCOTTISH EMIGRANTS HEATED WITH REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM AND UTTERLY DESTITUTE OF THE SKILL NECESSARY TO THE CONDUCT OF GREAT AFFAIRS EMPLOYED ALL THEIR INDUSTRY AND INGENUITY
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEING ASKED BY HOLOFERNES
BUT HE WAS PLACED UNDER THE CONTROL OF A COMMITTEE
LET GOD BE WITH THEE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF US THAT AS IT SHALL PLEASE THEE SO THOU WITH ALL THINE
WERE AT THIS TIME MOST DESIROUS THAT THE HOSPITALITY OF THEIR COUNTRY
THAT THE PRUDENCE OF THE LEADING WHIGS HAD WITH DIFFICULTY PREVENTED A SANGUINARY OUTBREAK ON THE DAY OF THE CORONATION AND THAT ALL THE GREAT LORDS WHO HAD SUPPORTED THE EXCLUSION BILL WERE IMPATIENT TO RALLY ROUND HIM
SHOULD ACCOMPANY ARGYLE TO SCOTLAND AND THAT FLETCHER SHOULD GO WITH MONMOUTH TO ENGLAND FLETCHER FROM THE BEGINNING HAD AUGURED ILL OF THE ENTERPRISE BUT HIS CHIVALROUS SPIRIT WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM TO DECLINE A RISK WHICH HIS FRIENDS SEEMED EAGER TO ENCOUNTER
TO THE EXCLUSION BILL AND TO THE CHARACTER OF THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY BUT IN VAIN LOCKE NEITHER BROKE OUT NOR DISSEMBLED BUT MAINTAINED SUCH STEADY SILENCE AND COMPOSURE AS FORCED THE TOOLS OF POWER TO OWN WITH VEXATION
THE KING SAID THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM UNQUESTIONABLE SOURCES INTELLIGENCE OF DESIGNS WHICH WERE FORMING AGAINST THE THRONE BY HIS BANISHED SUBJECTS IN HOLLAND SOME OF THE EXILES WERE CUTTHROATS
WHOM NOTHING BUT THE SPECIAL PROVIDENCE OF GOD HAD PREVENTED FROM COMMITTING A FOUL MURDER AND AMONG THEM WAS THE OWNER OF THE SPOT WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED FOR THE BUTCHERY
WENT THROUGH THE PLAINS BUT WHEN THEY CAME NEAR THE MOUNTAINS
O LORD GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH BEHOLD THEIR PRIDE AND LOOK ON OUR LOW CONDITION AND HAVE REGARD TO THE FACE OF THY SAINTS AND SHEW THAT THOU FORSAKEST NOT THEM THAT TRUST ON THEE
HAD COMMANDED HIM TO BE DELIVERED FOR THIS CAUSE TO THE ISRAELITES THAT WHEN HE SHOULD OVERCOME THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THEN HE MIGHT COMMAND ACHIOR ALSO HIMSELF TO BE PUT TO DEATH BY DIVERSE TORMENTS FOR HAVING SAID
AND TO LEAD HIM TO BETHULIA
THOUGH AS FAR AS SHE WAS HERSELF CONCERNED IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON
DIRTY SIR LOOK AT MY SHOES NOT A SPECK ON THEM WELL THAT IS QUITE SURPRISING FOR WE HAVE HAD A VAST DEAL OF RAIN HERE IT RAINED DREADFULLY HARD FOR HALF AN HOUR WHILE WE WERE AT BREAKFAST I WANTED THEM TO PUT OFF THE WEDDING
EMMA NEVER THINKS OF HERSELF IF SHE CAN DO GOOD TO OTHERS REJOINED MISTER WOODHOUSE UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART
WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN
THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM AND THE SMILES OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING THROWN AWAY AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET
BUT I MEANT NO REFLECTION ON ANY BODY MISS TAYLOR HAS BEEN USED TO HAVE TWO PERSONS TO PLEASE SHE WILL NOW HAVE BUT ONE THE CHANCES ARE THAT SHE MUST BE A GAINER WELL SAID EMMA WILLING TO LET IT PASS
AH POOR MISS TAYLOR TIS A SAD BUSINESS POOR MISTER AND MISS WOODHOUSE IF YOU PLEASE BUT I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY POOR MISS TAYLOR I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND EMMA
WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE SAID MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN MAY COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED AH MY DEAR I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS
EVERY BODY SAID THAT MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN OH DEAR NO MISTER WESTON WHO HAD BEEN A WIDOWER SO LONG
WITH AN URGENCY WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MISTER WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS YOUTH
FOR MISS SMITH WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHOM EMMA KNEW VERY WELL BY SIGHT AND HAD LONG FELT AN INTEREST IN ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEAUTY A VERY GRACIOUS INVITATION WAS RETURNED AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION
AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE ONE THAT I MADE THE MATCH MYSELF I MADE THE MATCH YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO
THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS
SUCCESS SUPPOSES ENDEAVOUR YOUR TIME HAS BEEN PROPERLY AND DELICATELY SPENT IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND
EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
SHE HAD MANY ACQUAINTANCE IN THE PLACE FOR HER FATHER WAS UNIVERSALLY CIVIL BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING WITH WHAT SELF DENYING GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND PROMOTED THE MATCH BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY
EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO THAT MISS TAYLOR AND I MET WITH HIM IN BROADWAY LANE WHEN BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO DRIZZLE HE DARTED AWAY WITH SO MUCH GALLANTRY AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT
AND I AM SURE SHE WILL MISS HER MORE THAN SHE THINKS FOR EMMA TURNED AWAY HER HEAD DIVIDED BETWEEN TEARS AND SMILES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND WHERE GIRLS MIGHT BE SENT TO BE OUT OF THE WAY AND SCRAMBLE THEMSELVES INTO A LITTLE EDUCATION
THE BACKGAMMON TABLE WAS PLACED BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WALKED IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY MISTER KNIGHTLEY A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT AND THIRTY WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY
FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS
WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY HE WAS A MUCH OLDER MAN IN WAYS THAN IN YEARS AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER
THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS
I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA YOU CANNOT THINK THAT I SHALL LEAVE OFF MATCH MAKING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY SUCCESS SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF
WE TALKED IT ALL OVER WITH MISTER WESTON LAST NIGHT AND AS FOR JAMES YOU MAY BE VERY SURE HE WILL ALWAYS LIKE GOING TO RANDALLS BECAUSE OF HIS DAUGHTER'S BEING HOUSEMAID THERE I ONLY DOUBT WHETHER HE WILL EVER TAKE US ANYWHERE ELSE THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA
LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER AND IN WINTER DRESSED THEIR CHILBLAINS WITH HER OWN HANDS IT WAS NO WONDER THAT A TRAIN OF TWENTY YOUNG COUPLE NOW WALKED AFTER HER TO CHURCH SHE WAS A PLAIN MOTHERLY KIND OF WOMAN WHO HAD WORKED HARD IN HER YOUTH
PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW THAT JACK THIS MORNING KNOCKED HIS SHUTTLECOCK THROUGH HIS BEDROOM WINDOW I WAS GOING TO SEND FOR THE GLAZIER TO MEND IT BUT AFTER YOU LENT THAT FIVE POUNDS I WAS SURE WE COULDN'T AFFORD IT OH NO
BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT MISTER CAUDLE I'LL NOT HAVE MY PEACE OF MIND DESTROYED BY THE BEST MAN THAT EVER TROD OH YES I KNOW YOU DON'T CARE SO LONG AS YOU CAN APPEAR WELL TO ALL THE WORLD BUT THE WORLD LITTLE THINKS HOW YOU BEHAVE TO ME
AND AFTER WE'VE INSURED FOR SO MANY YEARS BUT HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW ARE PEOPLE TO INSURE WHO MAKE DUCKS AND DRAKES OF THEIR FIVE POUNDS I DID THINK WE MIGHT GO TO MARGATE THIS SUMMER
AND IT MAY BE ARABIA PETREA A LEMON HEARTED CYNIC MIGHT LIKEN THE WEDDING RING TO AN ANCIENT CIRCUS IN WHICH WILD ANIMALS CLAWED ONE ANOTHER FOR THE SPORT OF LOOKERS ON
HOWEVER WHAT'S YOUR FAMILY TO YOU SO YOU CAN PLAY THE LIBERAL CREATURE WITH FIVE POUNDS DO YOU HEAR THAT SHUTTER HOW IT'S BANGING TO AND FRO YES I KNOW WHAT IT WANTS AS WELL AS YOU IT WANTS A NEW FASTENING
BUT HOW ARE PEOPLE TO AFFORD MOUSE TRAPS WHEN EVERY DAY THEY LOSE FIVE POUNDS HARK I'M SURE THERE'S A NOISE DOWNSTAIRS IT WOULDN'T AT ALL SURPRISE ME IF THERE WERE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WELL
EVEN SWINE ARE TAMED BY THEM YOU WILL SEE A VAGRANT HILARIOUS DEVASTATING PORKER A FULL BLOODED FELLOW THAT WOULD BLEED INTO MANY MANY FATHOMS OF BLACK PUDDING YOU WILL SEE HIM ESCAPED FROM HIS PROPER HOME STRAYING IN A NEIGHBOUR'S GARDEN
YES YOU'D DO EXACTLY LIKE THAT PRETTYMAN AND WHAT DID HE DO ONLY LAST WEDNESDAY WHY HE LET HIMSELF IN ABOUT FOUR IN THE MORNING AND BROUGHT HOME WITH HIM HIS POT COMPANION PUFFY HIS DEAR WIFE WOKE AT SIX
IF THEY WERE TO DRAG ONLY YOU OUT OF BED IT WOULD BE NO MATTER SET A TRAP FOR THEM YES
AND WAS THEREFORE MADE THE RECIPIENT OF A WIFE'S WISDOM MISSUS CAUDLE LIKE MAHOMET'S DOVE CONTINUALLY PECKED AT THE GOOD MAN'S EARS AND IT IS A HAPPINESS TO LEARN FROM WHAT HE LEFT BEHIND
PHILOSOPHERS HAVE DEBATED WHETHER MORNING OR NIGHT IS MOST CONDUCIVE TO THE STRONGEST AND CLEAREST MORAL IMPRESSIONS THE GRECIAN SAGE CONFESSED THAT HIS LABOURS SMELT OF THE LAMP
TO HAVE ADVICE COMMANDS REMONSTRANCE ALL SORTS OF SAWS AND ADAGES STILL POURED UPON HIM AND NO VISIBLE WIFE NOW DID THE VOICE SPEAK FROM THE CURTAINS NOW FROM THE TESTER AND NOW DID IT WHISPER TO JOB FROM THE VERY PILLOW THAT HE PRESSED
NICE COMPANIONS HE PICKS UP THERE YES PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT A BOAST TO TREAT THEIR WIVES LIKE SLAVES AND RUIN THEIR FAMILIES THERE'S THAT WRETCH HARRY PRETTYMAN SEE WHAT HE'S COME TO HE DOESN'T GET HOME NOW TILL TWO IN THE MORNING
HE WAS IN THE RIPE FULNESS OF FIFTY SEVEN FOR THREE HOURS AT LEAST AFTER HE WENT TO BED SUCH SLAVES ARE WE TO HABIT HE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE HIS WIFE STILL TALKED AT HIS SIDE
AS WAS THE TIN FUNNEL THROUGH WHICH MISSUS CAUDLE IN VINTAGE TIME BOTTLED HER ELDER WINE THERE WAS HOWEVER THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WISDOM AND THE WINE THE WINE WAS ALWAYS SUGARED
FOR THEY SHALL LIE UNDER MY PILLOW UNDER MY OWN HEAD MISTER CAUDLE
HOW HE TRAMPLES UPON THE HEART'S EASE HOW WITH QUIVERING SNOUT HE ROOTS UP LILIES ODORIFEROUS BULBS HERE HE GIVES A RECKLESS SNATCH AT THYME AND MARJORAM AND HERE HE MUNCHES VIOLETS AND GILLY FLOWERS
YES MISTER CAUDLE YOU'LL BE NICE AND ILL IN THE MORNING BUT DON'T YOU THINK I'M GOING TO LET YOU HAVE YOUR BREAKFAST IN BED LIKE MISSUS PRETTYMAN I'LL NOT BE SUCH A FOOL NO NOR I WON'T HAVE DISCREDIT BROUGHT UPON THE HOUSE BY SENDING FOR SODA WATER EARLY
JOB FAITHFULLY CHRONICLED ALL HIS LATE WIFE'S LECTURES THE GHOST OF HER TONGUE WAS THENCEFORTH SILENT AND JOB SLEPT ALL HIS AFTER NIGHTS IN PEACE WHEN JOB DIED A SMALL PACKET OF PAPERS WAS FOUND INSCRIBED AS FOLLOWS
THE GHOST OF HER TONGUE STILL TALKED AS IN THE LIFE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN DID JOB CAUDLE HEAR THE MONITIONS OF BYGONE YEARS AT TIMES SO LOUD SO LIVELY SO REAL WERE THE SOUNDS THAT JOB WITH A COLD CHILL
SO WAS MISSUS CAUDLE LIKE THE OWL SHE HOOTED ONLY AT NIGHT MISTER CAUDLE WAS BLESSED WITH AN INDOMITABLE CONSTITUTION ONE FACT WILL PROVE THE TRUTH OF THIS
YOU DON'T SEE IT'S RED NO I DARESAY NOT BUT I SEE IT I SEE A GREAT MANY THINGS YOU DON'T AND SO YOU'LL GO ON IN A LITTLE TIME WITH YOUR BRANDY AND WATER DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU ONLY TAKE TWO SMALL GLASSES
IT'S NOW HALF PAST TWELVE AND EXPECT I'M TO HOLD MY TONGUE AND LET YOU GO TO SLEEP WHAT NEXT I WONDER A WOMAN HAD BETTER BE SOLD FOR A SLAVE AT ONCE AND SO YOU'VE GONE AND JOINED A CLUB THE SKYLARKS INDEED
THE WINDOW MUST GO AS IT IS AND PRETTY WEATHER FOR A DEAR CHILD TO SLEEP WITH A BROKEN WINDOW HE'S GOT A COLD ALREADY ON HIS LUNGS AND I SHOULDN'T AT ALL WONDER IF THAT BROKEN WINDOW SETTLED HIM
THERE'S JOSKINS HE WAS A DECENT CREATURE ONCE AND NOW I'M TOLD HE HAS MORE THAN ONCE BOXED HIS WIFE'S EARS HE'S A SKYLARK TOO AND I SUPPOSE SOME DAY YOU'LL BE TRYING TO BOX MY EARS DON'T ATTEMPT IT MISTER CAUDLE I SAY DON'T ATTEMPT IT
OH DEAR DEAR AT LEAST YOU MIGHT GO WHERE THEY SMOKE GOOD TOBACCO BUT I CAN'T FORGET THAT I'M THEIR MOTHER AT LEAST THEY SHALL HAVE ONE PARENT TAVERNS NEVER DID A MAN GO TO A TAVERN WHO DIDN'T DIE A BEGGAR
THE SKYLARKS INDEED I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE BUYING A LITTLE WARBLER AND AT YOUR TIME OF LIFE BE TRYING TO SING THE PEACOCKS WILL SING NEXT A PRETTY NAME YOU'LL GET IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND
NEXT TUESDAY THE FIRE INSURANCE IS DUE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW IT'S TO BE PAID WHY IT CAN'T BE PAID AT ALL THAT FIVE POUNDS WOULD HAVE MORE THAN DONE IT AND NOW INSURANCE IS OUT OF THE QUESTION
MADE BUT A SMALL PART OF CATHERINE'S SPECULATION ONCE OR TWICE INDEED SINCE JAMES'S ENGAGEMENT HAD TAUGHT HER WHAT COULD BE DONE SHE HAD GOT SO FAR AS TO INDULGE IN A SECRET PERHAPS
AND HUNG OVER HER WITH AFFECTIONATE SOLICITUDE MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU MUST NOT YOU MUST NOT INDEED WERE ELEANOR'S FIRST CONNECTED WORDS I AM QUITE WELL THIS KINDNESS DISTRACTS ME
STRIKING AT THAT INSTANT ON HER MIND WITH PECULIAR FORCE
AND A STILL GREATER TO SPEAK WHEN THERE CATHERINE SUPPOSING SOME UNEASINESS ON CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ACCOUNT COULD ONLY EXPRESS HER CONCERN BY SILENT ATTENTION OBLIGED HER TO BE SEATED RUBBED HER TEMPLES WITH LAVENDER WATER
BUT CATHERINE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY INJURY OR ANY MISFORTUNE COULD PROVOKE SUCH ILL WILL AGAINST A PERSON NOT CONNECTED OR AT LEAST
ELEANOR BROUGHT NO MESSAGE VERY LITTLE PASSED BETWEEN THEM ON MEETING
WE CAN OFFER YOU NOTHING LIKE THE GAIETIES OF THIS LIVELY PLACE WE CAN TEMPT YOU NEITHER BY AMUSEMENT NOR SPLENDOUR FOR OUR MODE OF LIVING AS YOU SEE IS PLAIN AND UNPRETENDING
SHE WISHED ISABELLA HAD TALKED MORE LIKE HER USUAL SELF AND NOT SO MUCH ABOUT MONEY AND HAD NOT LOOKED SO WELL PLEASED AT THE SIGHT OF CAPTAIN TILNEY HOW STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT PERCEIVE HIS ADMIRATION
HIS DEPARTURE GAVE CATHERINE THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL CONVICTION THAT A LOSS MAY BE SOMETIMES A GAIN THE HAPPINESS WITH WHICH THEIR TIME NOW PASSED EVERY EMPLOYMENT VOLUNTARY EVERY LAUGH INDULGED
WITH A MIND THUS FULL OF HAPPINESS CATHERINE WAS HARDLY AWARE THAT TWO OR THREE DAYS HAD PASSED AWAY WITHOUT HER SEEING ISABELLA FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES TOGETHER SHE BEGAN FIRST TO BE SENSIBLE OF THIS AND TO SIGH FOR HER CONVERSATION
THOUGH EVIDENTLY INTENDING TO COME IN
IN A GOOD HEAVEN WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER IT WAS QUICKLY DECIDED BY ELEANOR TO BE HER ELDEST BROTHER WHOSE ARRIVAL WAS OFTEN AS SUDDEN IF NOT QUITE SO UNSEASONABLE AND ACCORDINGLY SHE HURRIED DOWN TO WELCOME HIM
I WILL TRUST TO YOUR OWN KINDNESS OF HEART WHEN I AM AT A DISTANCE FROM YOU BUT THIS WITH THE LOOK OF SORROW ACCOMPANYING IT WAS ENOUGH TO MELT CATHERINE'S PRIDE IN A MOMENT AND SHE INSTANTLY SAID OH ELEANOR I WILL WRITE TO YOU INDEED
AND STRENGTHENED HER DISTASTE FOR EVERYTHING BEFORE HER
SHE WAS EXPECTING HER SISTERS EVERY MOMENT SO THAT HER DEAREST CATHERINE MUST EXCUSE HER AND MUST SIT QUIETLY DOWN AGAIN BUT CATHERINE COULD BE STUBBORN TOO AND MISSUS ALLEN JUST THEN COMING UP TO PROPOSE THEIR RETURNING HOME
PSHA NONSENSE WAS ISABELLA'S ANSWER IN THE SAME HALF WHISPER WHY DO YOU PUT SUCH THINGS INTO MY HEAD IF I COULD BELIEVE IT MY SPIRIT YOU KNOW IS PRETTY INDEPENDENT
WITH ALL THE CHANCES AGAINST HER OF HOUSE HALL PLACE PARK COURT AND COTTAGE NORTHANGER TURNED UP AN ABBEY AND SHE WAS TO BE ITS INHABITANT ITS LONG DAMP PASSAGES ITS NARROW CELLS
THOUGH SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED IN SPEAKING OF IT HAD OCCURRED TO HER THAT AFTER SO LONG AN ABSENCE FROM HOME CATHERINE MIGHT NOT BE PROVIDED WITH MONEY ENOUGH FOR THE EXPENSES OF HER JOURNEY AND UPON SUGGESTING IT TO HER WITH MOST AFFECTIONATE OFFERS OF ACCOMMODATION
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THAT IF YOU ARE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY YOU WILL CERTAINLY LIVE TO REPENT IT
TO THINK THE WORSE OF ME FOR THE PART I AM OBLIGED TO PERFORM I AM INDEED A MOST UNWILLING MESSENGER AFTER WHAT HAS SO LATELY PASSED SO LATELY BEEN SETTLED BETWEEN US HOW JOYFULLY HOW THANKFULLY ON MY SIDE
I COULD NOT HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD A THING OF THAT KIND YOU KNOW
MY POOR HEAD I HAD QUITE FORGOT IT WELL THE THING IS THIS I HAVE JUST HAD A LETTER FROM JOHN YOU CAN GUESS THE CONTENTS NO INDEED I CANNOT MY SWEET LOVE
YET NO ENDEAVOURS SHALL BE WANTING ON OUR SIDE TO MAKE NORTHANGER ABBEY NOT WHOLLY DISAGREEABLE NORTHANGER ABBEY THESE WERE THRILLING WORDS AND WOUND UP CATHERINE'S FEELINGS TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF ECSTASY
THEY BY WHOM ABOVE ALL SHE DESIRED TO BE FAVOURABLY THOUGHT OF OUTSTRIPPED EVEN HER WISHES IN THE FLATTERING MEASURES BY WHICH THEIR INTIMACY WAS TO BE CONTINUED SHE WAS TO BE THEIR CHOSEN VISITOR
AND THEN TILL I CAN ASK FOR YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AS I OUGHT TO DO I WILL NOT EXPECT MORE DIRECT TO ME AT LORD LONGTOWN'S AND I MUST ASK IT UNDER COVER TO ALICE NO ELEANOR
WERE FELT AND CONSIDERED WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EMOTION AND THOUGH THE WIND WAS HIGH AND OFTEN PRODUCED STRANGE AND SUDDEN NOISES THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE SHE HEARD IT ALL AS SHE LAY AWAKE HOUR AFTER HOUR WITHOUT CURIOSITY OR TERROR
SHE PAUSED A MOMENT AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS JUST MADE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT SHE LEFT HER KIND REMEMBRANCE FOR HER ABSENT FRIEND
WELL IF YOU SAY IT IT WAS SO I DARE SAY BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CANNOT RECOLLECT IT I DO REMEMBER NOW BEING WITH YOU AND SEEING HIM AS WELL AS THE REST BUT THAT WE WERE
AT THAT MOMENT CATHERINE THOUGHT SHE HEARD HER STEP IN THE GALLERY AND LISTENED FOR ITS CONTINUANCE BUT ALL WAS SILENT SCARCELY HOWEVER HAD SHE CONVICTED HER FANCY OF ERROR WHEN THE NOISE OF SOMETHING MOVING CLOSE TO HER DOOR MADE HER START
THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT SHOULD BE SO MEEKLY BORNE THE POWER OF EARLY HABIT ONLY COULD ACCOUNT FOR IT A DISTINCTION TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BORN GAVE NO PRIDE THEIR SUPERIORITY OF ABODE WAS NO MORE TO THEM THAN THEIR SUPERIORITY OF PERSON
GENERAL TILNEY WAS NOT LESS SANGUINE HAVING ALREADY WAITED ON HER EXCELLENT FRIENDS IN PULTENEY STREET AND OBTAINED THEIR SANCTION OF HIS WISHES SINCE THEY CAN CONSENT TO PART WITH YOU SAID HE
AND TURNING AS PALE AS HER FRIEND SHE EXCLAIMED TIS A MESSENGER FROM WOODSTON YOU ARE MISTAKEN INDEED RETURNED ELEANOR LOOKING AT HER MOST COMPASSIONATELY IT IS NO ONE FROM WOODSTON IT IS MY FATHER HIMSELF
FOR THE EMPEROR'S RETURN THE EMPEROR IS NO LONGER ON THE THRONE THEN HE ABDICATED AT FONTAINEBLEAU IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN AND WAS SENT TO THE ISLAND OF ELBA BUT HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE THAT YOU ARE IGNORANT OF ALL THIS
BECAUSE AFTER TORTURE CAME DEATH AND AFTER DEATH IF NOT REPOSE AT LEAST THE BOON OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY DINT OF CONSTANTLY DWELLING ON THE IDEA THAT TRANQUILLITY WAS DEATH
DANTES UTTERED BLASPHEMIES THAT MADE HIS JAILER RECOIL WITH HORROR DASHED HIMSELF FURIOUSLY AGAINST THE WALLS OF HIS PRISON WREAKED HIS ANGER UPON EVERYTHING AND CHIEFLY UPON HIMSELF
AND WEARYING THE PATIENCE OF HIS JAILER WHO OUT OF KINDNESS OF HEART HAD BROUGHT BROTH AND WHITE BREAD FOR HIS PRISONER FORTUNATELY HE FANCIED THAT DANTES WAS DELIRIOUS AND PLACING THE FOOD ON THE RICKETY TABLE HE WITHDREW
AND STRIVING TO DIMINISH THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATED THEM NO NO DOUBTLESS HE WAS DECEIVED AND IT WAS BUT ONE OF THOSE DREAMS THAT FORERUN DEATH
IN THREE DAYS HE HAD SUCCEEDED WITH THE UTMOST PRECAUTION IN REMOVING THE CEMENT AND EXPOSING THE STONE WORK THE WALL WAS BUILT OF ROUGH STONES AMONG WHICH TO GIVE STRENGTH TO THE STRUCTURE BLOCKS OF HEWN STONE WERE AT INTERVALS IMBEDDED
AND IF PUNISHMENT WERE THE END IN VIEW OTHER TORTURES THAN DEATH MUST BE INVENTED HE BEGAN TO REFLECT ON SUICIDE UNHAPPY HE WHO ON THE BRINK OF MISFORTUNE BROODS OVER IDEAS LIKE THESE
HE LISTENED ALL WAS SILENT AS IT HAD BEEN FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS DANTES SIGHED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS NEIGHBOR DISTRUSTED HIM HOWEVER HE TOILED ON ALL THE NIGHT WITHOUT BEING DISCOURAGED
DANTES RAISED HIMSELF UP AND BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BAD QUALITY OF THE FOOD ABOUT THE COLDNESS OF HIS DUNGEON GRUMBLING AND COMPLAINING IN ORDER TO HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR SPEAKING LOUDER
DEVOURED IT SO TO SPEAK AS THE IMPLACABLE UGOLINO DEVOURS THE SKULL OF ARCHBISHOP ROGER IN THE INFERNO OF DANTE RAGE SUPPLANTED RELIGIOUS FERVOR
SOME HOURS AFTERWARDS IT BEGAN AGAIN NEARER AND MORE DISTINCT EDMOND WAS INTENSELY INTERESTED SUDDENLY THE JAILER ENTERED
AS HE KNELT WITH HIS HEAD IN THE OPENING SUDDENLY GAVE WAY HE DREW BACK SMARTLY WHILE A MASS OF STONES AND EARTH DISAPPEARED IN A HOLE THAT OPENED BENEATH THE APERTURE HE HIMSELF HAD FORMED
WAS HE TO BE THUS STOPPED AT THE BEGINNING AND WAS HE TO WAIT INACTIVE UNTIL HIS FELLOW WORKMAN HAD COMPLETED HIS TASK SUDDENLY AN IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM HE SMILED AND THE PERSPIRATION DRIED ON HIS FOREHEAD
IN THE MORNING THE JAILER BROUGHT HIM FRESH PROVISIONS HE HAD ALREADY DEVOURED THOSE OF THE PREVIOUS DAY HE ATE THESE LISTENING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE SOUND WALKING ROUND AND ROUND HIS CELL
YOU CAN TAKE IT AWAY WHEN YOU BRING ME MY BREAKFAST THIS ADVICE WAS TO THE JAILER'S TASTE AS IT SPARED HIM THE NECESSITY OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIP HE LEFT THE SAUCEPAN
SOON THE FURY OF THE WAVES AND THE SIGHT OF THE SHARP ROCKS ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF DEATH AND DEATH THEN TERRIFIED ME AND I USED ALL MY SKILL AND INTELLIGENCE AS A MAN AND A SAILOR TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE WRATH OF GOD BUT I DID SO BECAUSE I WAS HAPPY
ON A LEVEL WITH THE FLOOR HOW IS IT CONCEALED BEHIND MY BED HAS YOUR BED BEEN MOVED SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN A PRISONER NO WHAT DOES YOUR CHAMBER OPEN ON A CORRIDOR AND THE CORRIDOR ON A COURT
HIS PROSPECTS LESS DESPERATE HE WAS STILL YOUNG HE WAS ONLY FOUR OR FIVE AND TWENTY HE HAD NEARLY FIFTY YEARS TO LIVE WHAT UNFORSEEN EVENTS MIGHT NOT OPEN HIS PRISON DOOR AND RESTORE HIM TO LIBERTY
HE HAD NOT SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO RISE AND CAST HIS SUPPER OUT OF THE LOOPHOLE THE NEXT MORNING HE COULD NOT SEE OR HEAR THE JAILER FEARED HE WAS DANGEROUSLY ILL EDMOND HOPED HE WAS DYING THUS THE DAY PASSED AWAY
HE WENT TO A CORNER OF HIS DUNGEON DETACHED A STONE AND WITH IT KNOCKED AGAINST THE WALL WHERE THE SOUND CAME HE STRUCK THRICE AT THE FIRST BLOW THE SOUND CEASED AS IF BY MAGIC EDMOND LISTENED INTENTLY AN HOUR PASSED
EDMOND FANCIED HE HEARD A BITTER LAUGH RESOUNDING FROM THE DEPTHS
AT FIRST GAYLY THEN WITH DELIBERATION AND AT LAST WITH REGRET NOTHING BUT THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS OATH GAVE HIM STRENGTH TO PROCEED
PUSHED HIS BED AGAINST THE WALL AND LAY DOWN THE BREAKFAST CONSISTED OF A PIECE OF BREAD THE JAILER ENTERED AND PLACED THE BREAD ON THE TABLE WELL DON'T YOU INTEND TO BRING ME ANOTHER PLATE SAID DANTES NO REPLIED THE TURNKEY
WHO DID NOT GUESS HE HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY A CAPTIVE AS ANXIOUS FOR LIBERTY AS HIMSELF THREE DAYS PASSED SEVENTY TWO LONG TEDIOUS HOURS WHICH HE COUNTED OFF BY MINUTES AT LENGTH ONE EVENING
ALL HIS SORROWS ALL HIS SUFFERINGS WITH THEIR TRAIN OF GLOOMY SPECTRES FLED FROM HIS CELL WHEN THE ANGEL OF DEATH SEEMED ABOUT TO ENTER DANTES REVIEWED HIS PAST LIFE WITH COMPOSURE
THE PRISONER HAD DISCOVERED THE DANGER AND HAD SUBSTITUTED A LEVER FOR A CHISEL ENCOURAGED BY THIS DISCOVERY EDMOND DETERMINED TO ASSIST THE INDEFATIGABLE LABORER
ALL I DO KNOW IS THAT I WAS JUST NINETEEN WHEN I WAS ARRESTED THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN NOT QUITE TWENTY SIX MURMURED THE VOICE AT THAT AGE HE CANNOT BE A TRAITOR
A FRENCHMAN YOUR NAME
WHO ARE HUNG UP TO THE YARD ARM HE WOULD NOT DIE BY WHAT SEEMED AN INFAMOUS DEATH HE RESOLVED TO ADOPT THE SECOND AND BEGAN THAT DAY TO CARRY OUT HIS RESOLVE NEARLY FOUR YEARS HAD PASSED AWAY
WHEN MY MORNING AND EVENING MEALS ARE BROUGHT THOUGHT HE I WILL CAST THEM OUT OF THE WINDOW AND THEY WILL THINK THAT I HAVE EATEN THEM HE KEPT HIS WORD TWICE A DAY HE CAST OUT THROUGH THE BARRED APERTURE THE PROVISIONS HIS JAILER BROUGHT HIM
OF HAVING CONSPIRED TO AID THE EMPEROR'S RETURN
MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL WAS ONE OF THE BOASTS OF HIGHBURY AND A LIVELY CURIOSITY TO SEE HIM PREVAILED
BUT NEVER ACHIEVED NOW UPON HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE IT WAS VERY GENERALLY PROPOSED AS A MOST PROPER ATTENTION
AND TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE WISHES OF HIS OWN FRIENDLY AND SOCIAL DISPOSITION IT WAS NOW SOME TIME SINCE MISS TAYLOR HAD BEGUN TO INFLUENCE HIS SCHEMES BUT AS IT WAS NOT THE TYRANNIC INFLUENCE OF YOUTH ON YOUTH
AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS AND HOPED BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY THROUGH THE EVENING
SHE LOVED EVERY BODY WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER
ENOUGH TO SECURE THE PURCHASE OF A LITTLE ESTATE ADJOINING HIGHBURY WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS LONGED FOR ENOUGH TO MARRY A WOMAN AS PORTIONLESS EVEN AS MISS TAYLOR
NOT UNWILLING TO TALK AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD
WHERE MOST OF HIS LEISURE DAYS WERE SPENT AND BETWEEN USEFUL OCCUPATION AND THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY THE NEXT EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY HE HAD BY THAT TIME REALISED AN EASY COMPETENCE
AND HAD SENSE AND ENERGY AND SPIRITS THAT MIGHT BE HOPED WOULD BEAR HER WELL AND HAPPILY THROUGH ITS LITTLE DIFFICULTIES AND PRIVATIONS AND THEN THERE WAS SUCH COMFORT IN THE VERY EASY DISTANCE OF RANDALLS FROM HARTFIELD
AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO
WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY BUT PARTICULARLY CONNECTED WITH IT AS THE ELDER BROTHER OF ISABELLA'S HUSBAND HE LIVED ABOUT A MILE FROM HIGHBURY
HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY WORK WHENEVER SHE COULD AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU
IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE HER FATHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE
ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY
HE COULD COMMAND THE VISITS OF HIS OWN LITTLE CIRCLE IN A GREAT MEASURE AS HE LIKED HE HAD NOT MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE HIS HORROR OF LATE HOURS AND LARGE DINNER PARTIES
NOR FROM MISSING THE LUXURIES OF HER FORMER HOME
WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE
AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING
BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER
AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY
AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
AND SO APPARENT THAT EMMA WELL AS SHE KNEW HER FATHER WAS SOMETIMES TAKEN BY SURPRIZE
BUT ON SUCCEEDING EARLY IN LIFE TO A SMALL INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME INDISPOSED FOR ANY OF THE MORE HOMELY PURSUITS IN WHICH HIS BROTHERS WERE ENGAGED AND HAD SATISFIED AN ACTIVE CHEERFUL MIND
AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY
MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT OH NO MISTER WESTON CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN SOME PEOPLE EVEN TALKED OF A PROMISE TO HIS WIFE ON HER DEATHBED
WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT
AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS WHICH EXACTLY SUITED MISTER WOODHOUSE FULL OF TRIVIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND HARMLESS GOSSIP MISSUS GODDARD WAS THE MISTRESS OF A SCHOOL
NOT MERELY AS A PLACE OF ARMS AND AS A KEY TO THE LOW COUNTRIES BUT ALSO AS A TROPHY OF ENGLISH VALOUR IT WAS TO THE SUBJECTS OF CHARLES WHAT CALAIS HAD BEEN TO AN EARLIER GENERATION AND WHAT THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR
WHEN IT WAS NOISED ABROAD THAT THE COURT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO TREAT PAPISTS WITH THE SAME RIGOUR WHICH HAD BEEN SHOWN TO PRESBYTERIANS A VAGUE SUSPICION THAT THE KING AND THE DUKE WERE NOT SINCERE PROTESTANTS
AND OF THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL SENTIMENT OF THE NATION THE KING SHOULD EXPIATE HIS CRIMES WITH HIS BLOOD HE FOR A TIME EXPECTED A DEATH LIKE THAT OF HIS UNHAPPY PREDECESSORS EDWARD THE SECOND AND RICHARD THE SECOND
HE HAD AN OBVIOUS MOTIVE FOR WISHING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A BARREN QUEEN AND HE WAS THEREFORE SUSPECTED OF HAVING PURPOSELY RECOMMENDED ONE THE SALE OF DUNKIRK WAS JUSTLY IMPUTED TO HIM
AND WERE DISPOSED TO DOUBT WHETHER THE SULLEN PRECISENESS OF PRAISE GOD BAREBONE MIGHT NOT BE PREFERABLE TO THE OUTRAGEOUS PROFANENESS AND LICENTIOUSNESS OF THE BUCKINGHAMS AND SEDLEYS EVEN IMMORAL MEN
HE MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HIS SCORN OF THE MIMICS
UNHAPPILY FOR HIM HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF DISPLAYING HIS ADMIRABLE MILITARY TALENTS EXCEPT AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES WHILE HE LIVED HIS POWER STOOD FIRM AN OBJECT OF MINGLED AVERSION ADMIRATION
AND DREAD TO HIS SUBJECTS FEW INDEED LOVED HIS GOVERNMENT BUT THOSE WHO HATED IT MOST HATED IT LESS THAN THEY FEARED IT HAD IT BEEN A WORSE GOVERNMENT IT MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS STRENGTH HAD IT BEEN A WEAKER GOVERNMENT
HAD THERE BEEN SO LITTLE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION THE UNFORTUNATE ROMAN CATHOLICS INDEED WERE HELD TO BE SCARCELY WITHIN THE PALE OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY BUT THE CLERGY OF THE FALLEN ANGLICAN CHURCH
HIS WISH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN TO GOVERN CONSTITUTIONALLY AND TO SUBSTITUTE THE EMPIRE OF THE LAWS FOR THAT OF THE SWORD BUT HE SOON FOUND THAT HATED AS HE WAS BOTH BY ROYALISTS AND PRESBYTERIANS
HE HAD AT LEAST GIVEN HER GLORY IN EXCHANGE
THE PRESBYTERIANS OF SCOTLAND ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THE DOWNFALL OF THEIR CHURCH THE PAPISTS OF IRELAND ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THE LOSS OF THEIR LANDS AS FATHER OF THE DUCHESS OF YORK
AND THAT THE RESTORATION OF THE MONARCHY WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THE RESTORATION OF HIS OWN DILAPIDATED FORTUNES NONE OF THESE EXPECTANTS COULD RESTRAIN HIS INDIGNATION WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS AS POOR UNDER THE KING
YET WERE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS STILL IMPOSED ON HIM BY THE VERY ARMY TO WHICH HE OWED HIS IMMENSE AUTHORITY THAT SINGULAR BODY OF MEN WAS FOR THE MOST PART COMPOSED OF ZEALOUS REPUBLICANS
IF THE ENEMY ADVANCED THE TOWER SHOULD BE ABANDONED GREAT MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED IN THE STREETS CRYING OUT THAT ENGLAND WAS BOUGHT AND SOLD THE HOUSES AND CARRIAGES OF THE MINISTERS WERE ATTACKED BY THE POPULACE
HOW OLIVER'S PARLIAMENTS WERE CONSTITUTED HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY OF LITTLE MOMENT FOR HE POSSESSED THE MEANS OF CONDUCTING THE ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT THEIR SUPPORT AND IN DEFIANCE OF THEIR OPPOSITION
IT COULD IN NO WAY PROMOTE THE NATIONAL INTERESTS IT INVOLVED US IN INGLORIOUS UNPROFITABLE
THAT HE WAS ABLE TO OVERPOWER AND CRUSH EVERYTHING THAT CROSSED HIS PATH TO MAKE HIMSELF MORE ABSOLUTE MASTER OF HIS COUNTRY THAN ANY OF HER LEGITIMATE KINGS HAD BEEN AND TO MAKE HIS COUNTRY MORE DREADED AND RESPECTED THAN SHE HAD BEEN DURING MANY GENERATIONS
BUT CONSTANT TROUBLES WHICH MUST BE SUPPRESSED BY THE CONSTANT USE OF THE SWORD HE THEREFORE WISHED TO RESTORE IN ALL ESSENTIALS THAT ANCIENT CONSTITUTION WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE HAD ALWAYS LOVED AND FOR WHICH THEY NOW PINED
TO TAKE A STEP WHICH HAS NO PARALLEL IN THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE OF STUART
DREW ON HIM MUCH DESERVED AND SOME UNDESERVED CENSURE
THE PLACE WHERE ELIZABETH HAD WITH MANLY SPIRIT HURLED FOUL SCORN AT PARMA AND SPAIN WAS INSULTED BY THE INVADERS THE ROAR OF FOREIGN GUNS WAS HEARD
GIRT WITH A SWORD OF STATE CLAD IN A ROBE OF PURPLE AND PRESENTED WITH A RICH BIBLE IN WESTMINSTER HALL HIS OFFICE WAS NOT DECLARED HEREDITARY BUT HE WAS PERMITTED TO NAME HIS SUCCESSOR AND NONE COULD DOUBT THAT HE WOULD NAME HIS SON
SAW WITH INDIGNATION THE INCREASING SPLENDOUR AND PROFUSION OF WHITEHALL AND WERE IMMOVABLY FIXED IN THE BELIEF THAT THE MONEY WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE SUPPORTED THEIR HOUSEHOLDS HAD BY SOME INEXPLICABLE PROCESS
BY MAKING THE ENGLISH AND PROTESTANT POPULATION DECIDEDLY PREDOMINANT FOR THIS END HE GAVE THE REIN TO THE FIERCE ENTHUSIASM OF HIS FOLLOWERS WAGED WAR RESEMBLING THAT WHICH ISRAEL WAGED ON THE CANAANITES SMOTE THE IDOLATERS WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD
BUT IN A FEW YEARS HE THOUGHT IT SAFE TO PROCEED FURTHER AND TO RESTORE ALMOST EVERY PART OF THE ANCIENT SYSTEM UNDER HEW NAMES AND FORMS THE TITLE OF KING WAS NOT REVIVED
AND WHICH WERE SUBJECT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN ALONE THE COUNTRY HE MAINTAINED WOULD NEVER BE WELL GOVERNED TILL THE KNIGHTS OF SHIRES AND THE BURGESSES WERE CONTENT TO BE WHAT THEIR PREDECESSORS HAD BEEN IN THE DAYS OF ELIZABETH
BEFORE THE RESTORER OF ARISTOCRACY A SENTIMENT OF LOYALTY WOULD GRADUALLY BIND THE PEOPLE TO THE NEW DYNASTY AND
AT THE HEAD OF THEIR SERVING MEN AND TENANTS ON THE PIKES OF BRIGADES VICTORIOUS IN A HUNDRED BATTLES AND SIEGES WOULD BE A FRANTIC WASTE OF INNOCENT AND HONOURABLE BLOOD BOTH ROYALISTS AND REPUBLICANS
SEIZED ONE OF THE FINEST WEST INDIAN ISLANDS AND ACQUIRED ON THE FLEMISH COAST A FORTRESS WHICH CONSOLED THE NATIONAL PRIDE FOR THE LOSS OF CALAIS SHE WAS SUPREME ON THE OCEAN SHE WAS THE HEAD OF THE PROTESTANT INTEREST
AND SUDDENLY RETREAT INTO THE DARKNESS ON A SIGNAL FROM PEPPINO A SHORT TIME BEFORE THEY REACHED THE BATHS OF CARACALLA THE CARRIAGE STOPPED PEPPINO OPENED THE DOOR AND THE COUNT AND FRANZ ALIGHTED IN TEN MINUTES SAID THE COUNT TO HIS COMPANION
THE COUNT SAID A WORD IN ARABIC TO ALI AND THE HORSES WENT ON AT GREAT SPEED IT WAS JUST TWO O'CLOCK BY ALBERT'S WATCH
BUT HE WILL NOT MAKE ANY DIFFICULTY AT ENTERING MINE
THAT HE DID NOT HEAR THE NOISE OF HIS FOOTSTEPS WHO COMES THERE CRIED THE SENTINEL WHO WAS LESS ABSTRACTED AND WHO SAW BY THE LAMP LIGHT A SHADOW APPROACHING HIS CHIEF AT THIS CHALLENGE VAMPA ROSE QUICKLY DRAWING AT THE SAME MOMENT A PISTOL FROM HIS GIRDLE
WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED AND WAS LEANING ON THE ARM OF SIGNOR TORLONIA THE DUKE'S BROTHER I THINK ON THE CONTRARY
NO EXCELLENCY AND NEVER SHALL I FORGET IT RETURNED PEPPINO WITH AN ACCENT OF PROFOUND GRATITUDE NEVER THAT IS A LONG TIME
RISE AND ANSWER PEPPINO GLANCED ANXIOUSLY AT FRANZ
THE STREET WAS SAFER FOR HIM ALBERT THEN HAD FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE FAMOUS BANDIT CHIEF IN WHOSE EXISTENCE HE HAD FOR SO LONG A TIME REFUSED TO BELIEVE THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE HE HASTENED TO OPEN THE SECRETARY
AND TO WHOM I DESIRED TO PROVE THAT LUIGI VAMPA WAS A MAN OF HIS WORD COME YOUR EXCELLENCY THE COUNT ADDED
THE FRENCHMAN ASKED FOR A RENDEZVOUS
HAVE WHAT YOU WILL AND HE MADE A SIGN TO FRANZ TO TAKE WHAT HE PLEASED IS IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THEN TO SEND THE MONEY TO LUIGI VAMPA ASKED THE YOUNG MAN LOOKING FIXEDLY IN HIS TURN AT THE COUNT
WHO WERE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE CATACOMBS OF SAINT SEBASTIAN
REPLIED THE DUKE HERE I THINK IS ONE OF MY SERVANTS WHO IS SEEKING YOU THE DUKE WAS NOT MISTAKEN WHEN HE SAW FRANZ THE SERVANT CAME UP TO HIM YOUR EXCELLENCY HE SAID THE MASTER OF THE HOTEL DE LONDRES
AND FRANZ AND THE COUNT WERE IN UTTER DARKNESS EXCEPT THAT FIFTY PACES IN ADVANCE OF THEM A REDDISH GLARE MORE EVIDENT SINCE PEPPINO HAD PUT OUT HIS TORCH WAS VISIBLE ALONG THE WALL THEY ADVANCED SILENTLY THE COUNT GUIDING FRANZ
AT THE MISTAKE HE HAS COMMITTED FRANZ APPROACHED THE CHIEF ADVANCING SEVERAL STEPS TO MEET HIM WELCOME AMONG US YOUR EXCELLENCY HE SAID TO HIM YOU HEARD WHAT THE COUNT JUST SAID AND ALSO MY REPLY LET ME ADD THAT I WOULD NOT FOR THE FOUR THOUSAND PIASTRES
WELL WELL SAID HE DID YOU SEE THE POSTSCRIPT I DID INDEED SE ALLE SEI DELLA MATTINA LE QUATTRO MILE PIASTRE NON SONO NELLE MIE MANI
DID NOT RISE UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK
HERE WAS ONE WHOSE GAY TEMPERAMENT WAS NOT FOR A MOMENT ALTERED AS FOR FRANZ HE WAS ENCHANTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH ALBERT HAD SUSTAINED THE NATIONAL HONOR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BANDIT MY DEAR ALBERT HE SAID IF YOU WILL MAKE HASTE
FIVE CORRIDORS DIVERGED LIKE THE RAYS OF A STAR AND THE WALLS DUG INTO NICHES WHICH WERE ARRANGED ONE ABOVE THE OTHER IN THE SHAPE OF COFFINS SHOWED THAT THEY WERE AT LAST IN THE CATACOMBS DOWN ONE OF THE CORRIDORS WHOSE EXTENT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE
HAS SENT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT A MAN IS WAITING FOR YOU WITH A LETTER
THEN IT IS TO YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT THIS LETTER IS ADDRESSED IS THERE ANY ANSWER INQUIRED FRANZ TAKING THE LETTER FROM HIM YES YOUR FRIEND AT LEAST HOPES SO COME UP STAIRS WITH ME AND I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU
AND THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE DOOR THE COUNT TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HALF PAST TWELVE HE SAID
WHO WERE CONCEALED ON THE BANKS OF THE ALMO SURROUNDED THE CARRIAGE THE FRENCHMAN MADE SOME RESISTANCE AND NEARLY STRANGLED BEPPO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST FIVE ARMED MEN AND WAS FORCED TO YIELD THEY MADE HIM GET OUT WALK ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER
SIGNOR PASTRINI DID AS HE WAS DESIRED AND RETURNING FIVE MINUTES AFTER HE SAID THE COUNT AWAITS YOUR EXCELLENCY FRANZ WENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR AND A SERVANT INTRODUCED HIM TO THE COUNT HE WAS IN A SMALL ROOM WHICH FRANZ HAD NOT YET SEEN
AND WHISTLED IN A PECULIAR MANNER THE MAN IN THE MANTLE QUITTED THE WALL
I AM SURE HE WOULD NOT REFUSE YOU ALBERT'S FREEDOM WHAT INFLUENCE CAN I POSSIBLY HAVE OVER A BANDIT HAVE YOU NOT JUST RENDERED HIM A SERVICE THAT CAN NEVER BE FORGOTTEN WHAT IS THAT HAVE YOU NOT SAVED PEPPINO'S LIFE WELL WELL SAID THE COUNT WHO TOLD YOU THAT
AS HE LIVED AT FLORENCE AND HAD ONLY COME TO ROME TO PASS SEVEN OR EIGHT DAYS HE HAD BROUGHT BUT A HUNDRED LOUIS AND OF THESE HE HAD NOT MORE THAN FIFTY LEFT THUS SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED PIASTRES WERE WANTING
THE FRENCHMAN ASSURED HIM HE WOULD
NON SONO NELLE MIE MANI ALLA SETTE
AT WHICH I HAD FIXED YOUR FRIEND'S RANSOM THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED BUT SAID FRANZ LOOKING ROUND HIM UNEASILY
WHICH THE YOUNG MAN TRAVERSED WERE PLUNGED IN THE DEEPEST OBSCURITY THE DISTANCE WAS SHORT AND AT THE END OF TEN MINUTES HIS CARRIAGE OR RATHER THE COUNT'S STOPPED BEFORE THE HOTEL DE LONDRES
WERE TO BE SEEN TWENTY BRIGANDS OR MORE EACH HAVING HIS CARBINE WITHIN REACH
TO THEM BOTH TO MAKE UP THE SUM THAT ALBERT REQUIRED TRUE HE MIGHT IN SUCH A CASE RELY ON THE KINDNESS OF SIGNOR TORLONIA HE WAS THEREFORE ABOUT TO RETURN TO THE PALAZZO BRACCIANO WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME WHEN SUDDENLY A LUMINOUS IDEA CROSSED HIS MIND
HE WENT UP TO HIM BUT TO HIS EXTREME ASTONISHMENT THE STRANGER FIRST ADDRESSED HIM WHAT WANTS YOUR EXCELLENCY OF ME INQUIRED THE MAN RETREATING A STEP OR TWO AS IF TO KEEP ON HIS GUARD
FRANZ AND THE COUNT GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE PEPPINO PLACED HIMSELF BESIDE ALI AND THEY SET OFF AT A RAPID PACE ALI HAD RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND WENT DOWN THE CORSO CROSSED THE CAMPO VACCINO
PEPPINO GLIDED FIRST INTO THIS CREVICE AFTER THEY GOT ALONG A FEW PACES THE PASSAGE WIDENED PEPPINO PASSED LIGHTED HIS TORCH AND TURNED TO SEE IF THEY CAME AFTER HIM THE COUNT FIRST REACHED AN OPEN SPACE AND FRANZ FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY
SAID THE SERVANT ANNOUNCING TWO FRESH GUESTS NOW THEN TO BREAKFAST SAID BEAUCHAMP FOR IF I REMEMBER YOU TOLD ME YOU ONLY EXPECTED TWO PERSONS ALBERT MORREL MUTTERED ALBERT MORREL WHO IS HE
BUT I CANNOT ACCEPT THE OFFER OF ANY ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN SINCE MY HABITATION IS ALREADY PREPARED WHAT CRIED MORCERF
I CANNOT IN CONSCIENCE THEREFORE LET YOU RUN DOWN THE SPEECHES OF A MAN WHO WILL ONE DAY SAY TO ME

HOWEVER THE SIGHT OF THE EMERALD MADE THEM NATURALLY INCLINE TO THE FORMER BELIEF
THERE IS HALF PAST TEN STRIKING ALBERT CONFESS YOU HAVE DREAMED THIS AND LET US SIT DOWN TO BREAKFAST CONTINUED BEAUCHAMP BUT THE SOUND OF THE CLOCK HAD NOT DIED AWAY WHEN GERMAIN ANNOUNCED HIS EXCELLENCY THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

THE FIRST DAY YOU SET FOOT IN PARIS
UNDECEIVE YOURSELF MONSIEUR REPLIED MONTE CRISTO I AM QUITE SURE THAT ON THE CONTRARY

WHO DID THE PLATE IN MY PRESENCE THE FIRST CARD STRUCK OFF WAS TAKEN ACCORDING TO YOUR ORDERS
AND DIANA SUPPOSING THAT ANNE HEARD FROM HIM VOLUNTEERED NO INFORMATION GILBERT'S MOTHER WHO WAS A GAY FRANK LIGHT HEARTED LADY BUT NOT OVERBURDENED WITH TACT HAD A VERY EMBARRASSING HABIT OF ASKING ANNE

BUT I CALL HER MOTHER LAVENDAR AND I LOVE HER NEXT BEST TO FATHER I I EVEN LOVE HER A LITTLE BETTER THAN YOU TEACHER
HOWEVER IN AN HOUR I SHALL KNOW ALL BERTUCCIO CRIED HE STRIKING A LIGHT HAMMER WITH A PLIANT HANDLE ON A SMALL GONG BERTUCCIO THE STEWARD APPEARED AT THE DOOR MONSIEUR BERTUCCIO SAID THE COUNT DID YOU NEVER TELL ME THAT YOU HAD TRAVELLED IN FRANCE
MEANWHILE THE COUNT HAD ARRIVED AT HIS HOUSE
ALWAYS IN A PAINFULLY DISTINCT VOICE AND ALWAYS IN THE PRESENCE OF A CROWD IF SHE HAD HEARD FROM GILBERT LATELY POOR ANNE COULD ONLY BLUSH HORRIBLY AND MURMUR NOT VERY LATELY WHICH WAS TAKEN BY ALL MISSUS BLYTHE INCLUDED TO BE MERELY A MAIDENLY EVASION
AT THESE WORDS BERTUCCIO TURNED PALE
PAUL WAS THIRTEEN NOW AND VERY TALL FOR HIS YEARS HIS FACE AND EYES WERE AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER AND HIS FANCY WAS STILL LIKE A PRISM SEPARATING EVERYTHING THAT FELL UPON IT INTO RAINBOWS HE AND ANNE HAD DELIGHTFUL RAMBLES TO WOOD AND FIELD AND SHORE
I HAVE BEEN ALMOST OBLIGED TO WAIT BERTUCCIO MADE BUT ONE BOUND TO THE ANTE CHAMBER AND CRIED IN A HOARSE VOICE HIS EXCELLENCY'S HORSES MONTE CRISTO WROTE TWO OR THREE NOTES AND AS HE SEALED THE LAST THE STEWARD APPEARED

I CRIED THE STEWARD WITH A STRANGE EXPRESSION HIS EXCELLENCY DID NOT CHARGE ME TO PURCHASE THIS HOUSE IF HIS EXCELLENCY WILL RECOLLECT IF HE WILL THINK AH TRUE OBSERVED MONTE CRISTO
AND OPENED IT WITH A KEY WHICH HE WORE ROUND HIS NECK AND WHICH NEVER LEFT HIM AFTER HAVING SOUGHT FOR A FEW MINUTES HE STOPPED AT A LEAF WHICH HAD SEVERAL NOTES AND COMPARED THEM WITH THE DEED OF SALE WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE
THE HOUSE ALI HAD CHOSEN AND WHICH WAS TO SERVE AS A TOWN RESIDENCE TO MONTE CRISTO
AND RETURNED WITH A BUNDLE OF BANK NOTES WHICH THE NOTARY COUNTED LIKE A MAN WHO NEVER GIVES A RECEIPT FOR MONEY UNTIL AFTER HE IS SURE IT IS ALL THERE AND NOW DEMANDED THE COUNT ARE ALL THE FORMS COMPLIED WITH ALL SIR HAVE YOU THE KEYS
HAVE YOU BROUGHT IT HERE IT IS VERY WELL AND WHERE IS THIS HOUSE THAT I PURCHASE ASKED THE COUNT CARELESSLY ADDRESSING HIMSELF HALF TO BERTUCCIO HALF TO THE NOTARY THE STEWARD MADE A GESTURE THAT SIGNIFIED
IT DOESN'T SEEM A DAY SINCE I CAME HOME THAT SPRING EVENING WITH THE MAYFLOWERS WHEN I WAS LITTLE I COULDN'T SEE FROM ONE END OF THE SUMMER TO THE OTHER IT STRETCHED BEFORE ME LIKE AN UNENDING SEASON NOW TIS A HANDBREADTH TIS A TALE
PAUL ADORED HER AND THE COMPANIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM WAS BEAUTIFUL TO SEE BUT I DON'T CALL HER MOTHER JUST BY ITSELF HE EXPLAINED TO ANNE YOU SEE THAT NAME BELONGS JUST TO MY OWN LITTLE MOTHER AND I CAN'T GIVE IT TO ANY ONE ELSE YOU KNOW TEACHER
PAUL SHOOK HIS CHESTNUT CURLS SORROWFULLY THE TWIN SAILORS AND THE GOLDEN LADY NEVER CAME AT ALL HE SAID NORA WAS THERE BUT NORA IS NOT THE SAME TEACHER SHE IS CHANGED OH PAUL IT IS YOU WHO ARE CHANGED SAID ANNE
BESIDES THE MAIN ENTRANCE ANOTHER IN THE RUE PONTHIEU EVEN BEFORE THE COACHMAN HAD HAILED THE CONCIERGE THE MASSY GATES ROLLED ON THEIR HINGES THEY HAD SEEN THE COUNT COMING AND AT PARIS AS EVERYWHERE ELSE HE WAS SERVED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING
THE COACHMAN ENTERED AND TRAVERSED THE HALF CIRCLE WITHOUT SLACKENING HIS SPEED AND THE GATES WERE CLOSED ERE THE WHEELS HAD CEASED TO SOUND ON THE GRAVEL
AROUND THIS SHRUBBERY TWO ALLEYS LIKE TWO ARMS EXTENDED RIGHT AND LEFT AND FORMED A CARRIAGE DRIVE FROM THE IRON GATES TO A DOUBLE PORTICO ON EVERY STEP OF WHICH STOOD A PORCELAIN VASE FILLED WITH FLOWERS THIS HOUSE ISOLATED FROM THE REST HAD
AND NOW DON'T I LOVE HIM DON'T I LOVE HIM MORE THAN BEFORE THE MOST HORRIBLE THING IS SHE BEGAN BUT DID NOT FINISH HER THOUGHT
WOKE UP AT HIS USUAL HOUR THAT IS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING NOT IN HIS WIFE'S BEDROOM BUT ON THE LEATHER COVERED SOFA IN HIS STUDY HE TURNED OVER HIS STOUT WELL CARED FOR PERSON ON THE SPRINGY SOFA AS THOUGH HE WOULD SINK INTO A LONG SLEEP AGAIN
AND HE LIKED HIS NEWSPAPER AS HE DID HIS CIGAR AFTER DINNER FOR THE SLIGHT FOG IT DIFFUSED IN HIS BRAIN HE READ THE LEADING ARTICLE IN WHICH IT WAS MAINTAINED THAT IT WAS QUITE SENSELESS IN OUR DAY TO RAISE AN OUTCRY THAT RADICALISM WAS THREATENING TO SWALLOW UP ALL CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS
HOW WELL WE GOT ON SHE WAS CONTENTED AND HAPPY IN HER CHILDREN I NEVER INTERFERED WITH HER IN ANYTHING I LET HER MANAGE THE CHILDREN AND THE HOUSE JUST AS SHE LIKED IT'S TRUE IT'S BAD HER HAVING BEEN A GOVERNESS IN OUR HOUSE THAT'S BAD THERE'S SOMETHING COMMON
AS HE REMEMBERED THE ACUTELY PAINFUL SENSATIONS CAUSED HIM BY THIS QUARREL MOST UNPLEASANT OF ALL WAS THE FIRST MINUTE WHEN ON COMING HAPPY AND GOOD HUMORED FROM THE THEATER WITH A HUGE PEAR IN HIS HAND FOR HIS WIFE HE HAD NOT FOUND HIS WIFE IN THE DRAWING ROOM
EH MATVEY HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD IT'S ALL RIGHT SIR SHE WILL COME ROUND SAID MATVEY COME ROUND YES SIR DO YOU THINK SO WHO'S THERE ASKED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HEARING THE RUSTLE OF A WOMAN'S DRESS AT THE DOOR IT'S I
RECALLING EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED AND AGAIN EVERY DETAIL OF HIS QUARREL WITH HIS WIFE WAS PRESENT TO HIS IMAGINATION ALL THE HOPELESSNESS OF HIS POSITION AND WORST OF ALL HIS OWN FAULT YES SHE WON'T FORGIVE ME AND SHE CAN'T FORGIVE ME
STILL HOLDING HER AND STROKING HER SOFT LITTLE HAND HE TOOK OFF THE MANTELPIECE WHERE HE HAD PUT IT YESTERDAY A LITTLE BOX OF SWEETS AND GAVE HER TWO PICKING OUT HER FAVORITES A CHOCOLATE AND A FONDANT FOR GRISHA
THAT NOTHING COULD COME OF IT BUT FALSITY THAT TO AMEND TO SET RIGHT THEIR RELATIONS WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HER ATTRACTIVE AGAIN AND ABLE TO INSPIRE LOVE OR TO MAKE HIM AN OLD MAN NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOVE EXCEPT DECEIT AND LYING NOTHING COULD COME OF IT NOW
AND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH COULD NOT GET THROUGH EVEN A SHORT SERVICE WITHOUT HIS LEGS ACHING FROM STANDING UP AND COULD NEVER MAKE OUT WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF ALL THE TERRIBLE AND HIGH FLOWN LANGUAGE ABOUT ANOTHER WORLD WHEN LIFE MIGHT BE SO VERY AMUSING IN THIS WORLD AND WITH ALL THIS
HE FIRMLY HELD THOSE VIEWS ON ALL THESE SUBJECTS WHICH WERE HELD BY THE MAJORITY AND BY HIS PAPER AND HE ONLY CHANGED THEM WHEN THE MAJORITY CHANGED THEM OR MORE STRICTLY SPEAKING HE DID NOT CHANGE THEM BUT THEY IMPERCEPTIBLY CHANGED OF THEMSELVES WITHIN HIM
HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN ADAPTING HIS FACE TO THE POSITION IN WHICH HE WAS PLACED TOWARDS HIS WIFE BY THE DISCOVERY OF HIS FAULT INSTEAD OF BEING HURT DENYING DEFENDING HIMSELF BEGGING FORGIVENESS INSTEAD OF REMAINING INDIFFERENT EVEN ANYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN WHAT HE DID DO
SHE COULD NOT GET OUT OF THE HABIT OF REGARDING HIM AS HER HUSBAND AND LOVING HIM BESIDES THIS SHE REALIZED THAT IF EVEN HERE IN HER OWN HOUSE SHE COULD HARDLY MANAGE TO LOOK AFTER HER FIVE CHILDREN PROPERLY THEY WOULD BE STILL WORSE OFF WHERE SHE WAS GOING WITH THEM ALL
IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN NOTHING EXCEPT WHAT HE WANTED TO FORGET HIS WIFE AH YES HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND HIS HANDSOME FACE ASSUMED A HARASSED EXPRESSION TO GO OR NOT TO GO HE SAID TO HIMSELF
AND HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO BE DONE
HIS LIPS SWELLED HIS EYES WERE SWIMMING WITH TEARS DOLLY HE SAID SOBBING NOW FOR MERCY'S SAKE THINK OF THE CHILDREN THEY ARE NOT TO BLAME I AM TO BLAME AND PUNISH ME MAKE ME EXPIATE MY FAULT ANYTHING I CAN DO I AM READY TO DO ANYTHING
BUT TODAY THAT SATISFACTION WAS EMBITTERED BY MATRONA PHILIMONOVNA'S ADVICE AND THE UNSATISFACTORY STATE OF THE HOUSEHOLD
FEELING HIMSELF CLEAN FRAGRANT HEALTHY AND PHYSICALLY AT EASE IN SPITE OF HIS UNHAPPINESS HE WALKED WITH A SLIGHT SWING ON EACH LEG INTO THE DINING ROOM WHERE COFFEE WAS ALREADY WAITING FOR HIM AND BESIDE THE COFFEE LETTERS AND PAPERS FROM THE OFFICE
AND SAW HER AT LAST IN HER BEDROOM WITH THE UNLUCKY LETTER THAT REVEALED EVERYTHING IN HER HAND SHE HIS DOLLY FOREVER FUSSING AND WORRYING OVER HOUSEHOLD DETAILS AND LIMITED IN HER IDEAS AS HE CONSIDERED
AND HOW VULGARLY SHE SHOUTED HE SAID TO HIMSELF REMEMBERING HER SHRIEK AND THE WORDS SCOUNDREL AND MISTRESS AND VERY LIKELY THE MAIDS WERE LISTENING HORRIBLY VULGAR HORRIBLE STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH STOOD A FEW SECONDS ALONE
WITH PAIN AND WRATH SHE UTTERED THE WORD SO TERRIBLE TO HERSELF STRANGER HE LOOKED AT HER AND THE FURY EXPRESSED IN HER FACE ALARMED AND AMAZED HIM
REALIZED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS ARRIVAL THAT IS THAT ANNA ARKADYEVNA THE SISTER HE WAS SO FOND OF MIGHT BRING ABOUT A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE ALONE OR WITH HER HUSBAND INQUIRED MATVEY
HOW IS MAMMA HE ASKED PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS DAUGHTER'S SMOOTH SOFT LITTLE NECK GOOD MORNING HE SAID SMILING TO THE BOY WHO HAD COME UP TO GREET HIM HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE LOVED THE BOY LESS AND ALWAYS TRIED TO BE FAIR BUT THE BOY FELT IT
THE WIDOW OF A STAFF CAPTAIN KALININ CAME WITH A REQUEST IMPOSSIBLE AND UNREASONABLE BUT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AS HE GENERALLY DID MADE HER SIT DOWN HEARD HER TO THE END ATTENTIVELY WITHOUT INTERRUPTING HER AND GAVE HER DETAILED ADVICE AS TO HOW AND TO WHOM TO APPLY
MATVEY MY SISTER ANNA ARKADYEVNA WILL BE HERE TOMORROW HE SAID CHECKING FOR A MINUTE THE SLEEK PLUMP HAND OF THE BARBER CUTTING A PINK PATH THROUGH HIS LONG CURLY WHISKERS THANK GOD SAID MATVEY SHOWING BY THIS RESPONSE THAT HE LIKE HIS MASTER
BUT AFTER ALL WHILE SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE I KEPT MYSELF IN HAND AND THE WORST OF IT ALL IS THAT SHE'S ALREADY IT SEEMS AS IF ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT SO
WERE HEARD OUTSIDE THE DOOR THEY WERE CARRYING SOMETHING AND DROPPED IT I TOLD YOU NOT TO SIT PASSENGERS ON THE ROOF SAID THE LITTLE GIRL IN ENGLISH THERE PICK THEM UP EVERYTHING'S IN CONFUSION THOUGHT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH THERE ARE THE CHILDREN RUNNING ABOUT BY THEMSELVES
THAT THE GERMAN WAS WOUND UP FOR A WHOLE LIFETIME HIMSELF TO WIND UP WATCHES AND HE SMILED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS FOND OF A JOKE AND MAYBE SHE WILL COME ROUND THAT'S A GOOD EXPRESSION COME ROUND HE THOUGHT I MUST REPEAT THAT MATVEY HE SHOUTED
AND THAT I WAS GOING TO LEAVE BEHIND IT WAS VERY BITTER ESPECIALLY AS I HAD EXPECTED TO GO WITH MY ELDER BROTHER TO SPEND THE DAY AT A NEIGHBOURING FARM MISSUS MITCHELL OPENED THE DOOR AND LED ME IN IT WAS AN AWFUL EXPERIENCE DAME SHAND STOOD AT HER TABLE IRONING
SO LONG AS I DO REMAIN IN PARIS AND NOTHING FORCES ME TO QUIT IT DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT I MAY RELY ON RECEIVING THE SUM YOU JUST NOW MENTIONED TO ME
IN THE FARTHER CORNER TWO WERE KICKING AT EACH OTHER AS OPPORTUNITY OFFERED LOOKING VERY ANGRY BUT NOT DARING TO CRY MY NEXT DISCOVERY WAS TERRIBLY DISCONCERTING SOME MOVEMENT DREW MY EYES TO THE FLOOR THERE I SAW A BOY OF MY OWN AGE ON ALL FOURS
SAID ANDREA TAKING THE MAJOR BY THE ARM IN A CONFIDENTIAL MANNER HOW MUCH ARE YOU PAID FOR BEING MY FATHER THE MAJOR WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WHEN ANDREA CONTINUED IN A LOW VOICE NONSENSE I AM GOING TO SET YOU AN EXAMPLE OF CONFIDENCE
YOUR MISFORTUNES ENGAGED HIS SYMPATHIES SO YOU SEE YOU MUST HAVE BEEN INTERESTING HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO RESTORE YOU TO THE POSITION WHICH YOU HAD LOST AND THAT HE WOULD SEEK YOUR FATHER UNTIL HE FOUND HIM HE DID SEEK AND HAS FOUND HIM APPARENTLY SINCE HE IS HERE NOW
WELL MONSIEUR I AM AT YOUR SERVICE
WILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN YOUR MEANING SAID THE MAJOR ENDEAVORING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO ASSUME AN AIR OF THE GREATEST MAJESTY
FASTENED BY A STRING TO A LEG OF THE TABLE AT WHICH THE DAME WAS IRONING WHILE HORRIBLE TO RELATE A DOG NOT VERY BIG BUT VERY UGLY AND BIG ENOUGH TO BE FRIGHTENED AT LAY UNDER THE TABLE WATCHING HIM I GAZED IN UTTER DISMAY
HE IS A MILLIONAIRE HIS INCOME IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THEN SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH ANXIETY I SHALL BE SURE TO BE PLACED IN AN AGREEABLE POSITION ONE OF THE MOST AGREEABLE POSSIBLE MY DEAR SIR
I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM FOR IT WILL BE NECESSARY HE SHOULD KNOW YOU AS HE IS TO PAY YOUR MONEY FULL DRESS SAID THE MAJOR HALF ALOUD OH YES CERTAINLY SAID THE COUNT UNIFORM CROSS KNEE BREECHES AND HOW SHALL I BE DRESSED DEMANDED ANDREA
AND THE SUBJECT OF UNPLEASANT REMARK I AGREE WITH YOU MONSIEUR SAID THE YOUNG MAN TURNING PALE AND IN SPITE OF HIMSELF TREMBLING BENEATH THE SCRUTINIZING LOOK OF HIS COMPANION SUCH CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT
SAID THE DAME IN A DUBIOUS TONE I HOPE HE'S A GOOD BOY FOR HE MUST BE GOOD IF HE COMES HERE WELL HE'S JUST MIDDLING HIS FATHER SPARES THE ROD MISSUS SHAND AND WE KNOW WHAT COMES OF THAT THEY WENT ON WITH THEIR TALK WHICH AS FAR AS I CAN RECALL IT
WE WILL BE WITH YOU AT THAT TIME SAID THE MAJOR
AND I AS A DUTIFUL SON AS THEY CHOOSE THAT I SHALL BE DESCENDED FROM YOU WHOM DO YOU MEAN BY THEY MA FOI I CAN HARDLY TELL BUT I WAS ALLUDING TO THOSE WHO WROTE THE LETTER YOU RECEIVED ONE DID YOU NOT YES FROM WHOM
THEN READ FOR YOURSELF AND THE MAJOR GAVE A LETTER INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S HAND ANDREA READ IN A LOW VOICE
FROM A CERTAIN ABBE BUSONI HAVE YOU ANY KNOWLEDGE OF HIM NO I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM WHAT DID HE SAY IN THE LETTER YOU WILL PROMISE NOT TO BETRAY ME REST ASSURED OF THAT YOU WELL KNOW THAT OUR INTERESTS ARE THE SAME
AS FOR ME YOU MUST KNOW I CANNOT POSSIBLY LIVE OUT OF LUCCA THEREFORE I SHALL RETURN TO ITALY AS SOON AS I CAN BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE FRANCE MY DEAR FATHER I HOPE YOU WILL PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF THE DOCUMENTS WHICH WILL BE NECESSARY TO PROVE MY DESCENT
CERTAINLY I WILL DO SO SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH A QUICKNESS WHICH GAVE PROOF OF HIS READY INVENTION I AM AS YOU HAVE SAID THE COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI SON OF MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI
EXCLAIMED ANDREA EVIDENTLY CHARMED WITH THE IDEA OF HIS SPEEDY DEPARTURE THEREFORE SAID MONTE CRISTO FEIGNING TO MISTAKE HIS MEANING THEREFORE I WILL NOT FOR ANOTHER INSTANT RETARD THE PLEASURE OF YOUR MEETING ARE YOU PREPARED TO EMBRACE YOUR WORTHY FATHER
I HOPE YOU DO NOT DOUBT IT GO THEN INTO THE DRAWING ROOM MY YOUNG FRIEND WHERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR FATHER AWAITING YOU ANDREA MADE A LOW BOW TO THE COUNT AND ENTERED THE ADJOINING ROOM MONTE CRISTO WATCHED HIM TILL HE DISAPPEARED
NOT KNOWING WITH CERTAINTY WHAT SHE MEANT I WAS SILENT NO SULKING SAID THE DAME AND OPENING A DRAWER IN THE TABLE SHE TOOK OUT A CATECHISM TURNING BACK THE COVER SHE PUT IT IN MY HAND AND TOLD ME TO LEARN THE FIRST QUESTION
FROM AN ENGLISHMAN CALLED LORD WILMORE WHO TAKES THE NAME OF SINBAD THE SAILOR AND OF WHOM YOU HAVE NO MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN I OF THE ABBE BUSONI YOU ARE MISTAKEN THERE I AM AHEAD OF YOU YOU HAVE SEEN HIM THEN YES ONCE WHERE
A MISERABLE OLD AGE AWAITS YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO BECOME RICH OR AT LEAST INDEPENDENT SET OUT IMMEDIATELY FOR PARIS AND DEMAND OF THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
SAID THE MAJOR I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT I RECEIVED A LETTER ALMOST TO THE SAME EFFECT YOU YES FROM THE ABBE BUSONI NO FROM WHOM THEN
ASKED CAVALCANTI AH SAID ANDREA WHEN MAY WE HOPE FOR THAT PLEASURE ON SATURDAY IF YOU WILL YES LET ME SEE SATURDAY
I WOULD WISH TO KNOW IF THEY HAVE NOT IN SOME MEASURE CONTRIBUTED TO RENDER YOU A STRANGER TO THE WORLD IN WHICH YOUR FORTUNE AND YOUR NAME ENTITLE YOU TO MAKE A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE SIR RETURNED THE YOUNG MAN WITH A REASSURANCE OF MANNER
INDEED HIS GRIEFS HOPES AND FEARS ON THAT SUBJECT MIGHT FURNISH MATERIAL FOR A MOST TOUCHING AND PATHETIC POEM AT LENGTH HE ONE DAY RECEIVED A LETTER STATING THAT THE ABDUCTORS OF HIS SON NOW OFFERED TO RESTORE HIM OR AT LEAST TO GIVE NOTICE WHERE HE MIGHT BE FOUND
BY THE MARCHESA CORSINARI AND WHO WAS TAKEN FROM YOU AT FIVE YEARS OF AGE THIS SON IS NAMED ANDREA CAVALCANTI IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY NOT DOUBT THE KIND INTENTION OF THE WRITER OF THIS LETTER YOU WILL FIND ENCLOSED AN ORDER FOR TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FRANCS
AH THAT IS JUST WHAT I CANNOT TELL YOU IF I DID I SHOULD MAKE YOU AS WISE AS MYSELF WHICH IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO DO AND WHAT DID THE LETTER CONTAIN READ IT YOU ARE POOR AND YOUR FUTURE PROSPECTS ARE DARK AND GLOOMY DO YOU WISH FOR A NAME
NOT DRAWING MORE THAN ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THE WHOLE FORMING A CAPITAL OF ABOUT FIFTY MILLIONS FINALLY I CALL THOSE THIRD RATE FORTUNES WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF A FLUCTUATING CAPITAL
AND DISAPPEARED A MINUTE AFTER THE DOOR BY WHICH THE PRIEST HAD ENTERED REOPENED AND MONTE CRISTO APPEARED
YOU HAVE NOTHING BUT YOUR REAL PRINCIPAL OF ABOUT FIVE OR SIX MILLIONS AT THE MOST FOR THIRD RATE FORTUNES ARE NEVER MORE THAN A FOURTH OF WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE
SEVEN SUCH MONTHS CONTINUED MONTE CRISTO IN THE SAME TONE TELL ME HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SEVEN TIMES
AND RETURNED BY YOU TO ME WITH YOUR INDORSEMENT OF COURSE I IMMEDIATELY COUNTED HIM OVER THE FORTY BANK NOTES MONTE CRISTO NODDED HIS HEAD IN TOKEN OF ASSENT BUT THAT IS NOT ALL CONTINUED DANGLARS
ONE OF THE NOBLEST FAMILIES IN TUSCANY WHO WHEN HIS SONS MARRIED ACCORDING TO HIS WISH GAVE THEM MILLIONS AND WHEN THEY MARRIED AGAINST HIS CONSENT MERELY ALLOWED THEM THIRTY CROWNS A MONTH SHOULD ANDREA
HE WAS TELLING ME THIS MORNING THAT TIRED OF LETTING HIS PROPERTY LIE DORMANT IN ITALY WHICH IS A DEAD NATION HE WISHED TO FIND A METHOD EITHER IN FRANCE OR ENGLAND OF MULTIPLYING HIS MILLIONS
WAS BROUGHT BY TELEGRAPH SO THAT SAID MONTE CRISTO YOU HAVE LOST NEARLY ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THIS MONTH NOT NEARLY INDEED THAT IS EXACTLY MY LOSS
HE WILL PERHAPS GIVE HIM ONE TWO OR THREE MILLIONS FOR EXAMPLE SUPPOSING IT WERE THE DAUGHTER OF A BANKER HE MIGHT TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE HOUSE OF THE FATHER IN LAW OF HIS SON THEN AGAIN IF HE DISLIKED HIS CHOICE
WHILE THE BANKER WAS WAITING IN THE ANTEROOM THE DOOR OPENED AND A MAN DRESSED AS AN ABBE AND DOUBTLESS MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE HOUSE THAN HE WAS CAME IN AND INSTEAD OF WAITING MERELY BOWED PASSED ON TO THE FARTHER APARTMENTS
BUT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVE NOT HEARD OF THIS
WHY HOW COULD YOU MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE SUCH AN OLD STAGER
WE HAVE OUR CLOTHES SOME MORE SPLENDID THAN OTHERS THIS IS OUR CREDIT BUT WHEN A MAN DIES HE HAS ONLY HIS SKIN IN THE SAME WAY ON RETIRING FROM BUSINESS
AH WELL HE WOULD CARE VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT I THINK BUT HE IS BETROTHED TO YOUR DAUGHTER I BELIEVE WELL
YOU DO NOT KNOW THESE ULTRAMONTANE MILLIONAIRES THEY ARE REGULAR MISERS AND BY WHOM WERE THEY RECOMMENDED TO YOU OH BY THE HOUSE OF FENZI ONE OF THE BEST IN FLORENCE
HAVE BECOME REFLECTED IN THEM CERTAINLY SAID DANGLARS AND THIS IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY THE FACT OF THEIR NOT POSSESSING AN INCH OF LAND VERY LITTLE AT LEAST I KNOW OF NONE WHICH CAVALCANTI POSSESSES
DOUBLE LOCKS HIS COFFER AND MASTER ANDREA WOULD BE OBLIGED TO LIVE LIKE THE SONS OF A PARISIAN FAMILY BY SHUFFLING CARDS OR RATTLING THE DICE AH THAT BOY WILL FIND OUT SOME BAVARIAN OR PERUVIAN PRINCESS
DO YOU THINK SO I AM SURE OF IT AND YOU HAVE HEARD HIS FORTUNE MENTIONED NOTHING ELSE WAS TALKED OF ONLY SOME SAID HE WAS WORTH MILLIONS AND OTHERS THAT HE DID NOT POSSESS A FARTHING
WATCHED THE DEPARTURE HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR
HE WILL WANT A CROWN AND AN IMMENSE FORTUNE NO THESE GRAND LORDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ALPS FREQUENTLY MARRY INTO PLAIN FAMILIES LIKE JUPITER THEY LIKE TO CROSS THE RACE
COME THAT IS SOMETHING YES AND MORE THAN THAT HE LETS IT TO THE MINISTER OF FINANCE WHILE HE LIVES IN A SIMPLE HOUSE OH AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE I THINK THE OLD FELLOW IS VERY CLOSE
SHE SPECULATED AND LOST IT IS TRUE SHE SPECULATES WITH HER OWN MONEY NOT MINE NEVERTHELESS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS LEAVE THE WIFE'S POCKET THE HUSBAND ALWAYS FINDS IT OUT
WHOM YOU PERHAPS SAW PASS BY HAS JUST ARRIVED IN PARIS NOT HAVING SEEN HIM FOR A LONG TIME I COULD NOT MAKE UP MY MIND TO LEAVE HIM SOONER SO I HOPE THIS WILL BE SUFFICIENT REASON FOR MY HAVING MADE YOU WAIT
COME YOU DO NOT FLATTER HIM I SCARCELY KNOW HIM I THINK I HAVE SEEN HIM THREE TIMES IN MY LIFE ALL I KNOW RELATING TO HIM IS THROUGH BUSONI AND HIMSELF
THAT DEPENDS UPON CIRCUMSTANCES
IT IS A HARD BLOW FOR A THIRD RATE FORTUNE
I HAVE BEEN DEFEATED IN TRIESTE BUT MY NAVAL ARMY IN INDIA WILL HAVE TAKEN SOME GALLEONS AND MY MEXICAN PIONEERS WILL HAVE DISCOVERED SOME MINE VERY GOOD VERY GOOD
WELL WHAT THEN WHILE HIS NAME IS NOT MORCERF HOW NOT MORCERF NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD GO ON I HAVE BEEN MADE A BARON
AT THIS TIME THAT IS ABOUT HALF PAST TWELVE
BOTH HAVING BECOME NOBLE BOTH RICH ARE ABOUT EQUAL IN WORTH EXCEPTING THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CERTAIN THINGS MENTIONED OF HIM THAT WERE NEVER SAID OF ME
HOW CAN A YOUNG MAN LIVE UPON FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH BUT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE YOUNG MAN SHOULD WANT A FEW THOUSANDS MORE DO NOT ADVANCE IT THE FATHER WILL NEVER REPAY IT
AND MY CASHIER WAS QUITE PROUD OF IT WHEN I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHO THE CAVALCANTI WERE BY THE WAY THIS IS MERELY A SIMPLE QUESTION WHEN THIS SORT OF PEOPLE MARRY THEIR SONS DO THEY GIVE THEM ANY FORTUNE
AND I HAVE HEARD NOTHING BUT BAD NEWS AH INDEED SAID MONTE CRISTO HAVE YOU HAD ANOTHER FALL AT THE BOURSE
OH NOTHING AH YES
THE CHAMPS ELYSEES COME LET US TALK A LITTLE ABOUT MY FATHER WHO THEN AM I YOU SIR YOU ARE MY ADOPTED FATHER
GENTLEMEN I KNOW I AM IN THE HANDS OF AN AVENGING GOD WE NEED NO PROOFS EVERYTHING RELATING TO THIS YOUNG MAN IS TRUE A DULL GLOOMY SILENCE LIKE THAT WHICH PRECEDES SOME AWFUL PHENOMENON OF NATURE PERVADED THE ASSEMBLY WHO SHUDDERED IN DISMAY
AND THE JURY MANIFESTED TOKENS OF DISGUST FOR CYNICISM SO UNEXPECTED IN A MAN OF FASHION
IF I HAVE COMMITTED AN ADDITIONAL CRIME PUNISH ME BUT IF YOU WILL ALLOW THAT EVER SINCE THE DAY OF MY BIRTH MY FATE HAS BEEN SAD BITTER AND LAMENTABLE THEN PITY ME BUT YOUR MOTHER ASKED THE PRESIDENT MY MOTHER THOUGHT ME DEAD SHE IS NOT GUILTY
YOUR AGE REPEATED THE PRESIDENT
THIS SUDDEN FORTUNE THE FACILITY WITH WHICH I HAVE OVERCOME ALL OBSTACLES AN UNEXPECTED FAMILY AND AN ILLUSTRIOUS NAME AWARDED TO ME GOLD SHOWERED DOWN UPON ME
WELL BE IT SO YOU HAVE CONTINUED YOUR COURSE OF VILLANY YOU HAVE ROBBED YOU HAVE ASSASSINATED WELL I SHOULD SAY IF YOU HAD ME TAKEN TO A PRIVATE ROOM ONLY TO TELL ME THIS YOU MIGHT HAVE SAVED YOURSELF THE TROUBLE I KNOW ALL THESE THINGS
WHO WAS ALSO GAZING WITH SAD ASTONISHMENT UPON THE IRON BARS THE BOLTED DOORS AND THE SHADOW WHICH MOVED BEHIND THE OTHER GRATING AH SAID ANDREA DEEPLY AFFECTED GOOD MORNING BENEDETTO SAID BERTUCCIO WITH HIS DEEP HOLLOW VOICE
LET US TALK OF THOSE IF YOU PLEASE WHO SENT YOU COME COME YOU ARE GOING ON QUICKLY M
AND AS HE SPOKE THESE WORDS WITH A HOARSE CHOKING VOICE HE STAGGERED TOWARDS THE DOOR WHICH WAS MECHANICALLY OPENED BY A DOOR KEEPER THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY WERE DUMB WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THE REVELATION AND CONFESSION WHICH HAD PRODUCED A CATASTROPHE SO DIFFERENT
ANDREA EXTENDED HIS HAND BERTUCCIO KEPT HIS OWN IN HIS POCKET AND MERELY JINGLED A FEW PIECES OF MONEY THAT'S WHAT I MEAN SAID ANDREA ENDEAVORING TO SMILE QUITE OVERCOME BY THE STRANGE TRANQUILLITY OF BERTUCCIO CAN I BE DECEIVED HE MURMURED
KING'S ATTORNEY YES AND IF YOU WISH TO KNOW HIS NAME I WILL TELL IT
THEN I BECAME A THIEF AND LATELY HAVE BECOME AN ASSASSIN A MURMUR OR RATHER STORM OF INDIGNATION BURST FROM ALL PARTS OF THE ASSEMBLY
I DID NOT EVEN WISH TO KNOW HER NAME NOR DO I KNOW IT JUST THEN A PIERCING CRY ENDING IN A SOB BURST FROM THE CENTRE OF THE CROWD WHO ENCIRCLED THE LADY WHO HAD BEFORE FAINTED AND WHO NOW FELL INTO A VIOLENT FIT OF HYSTERICS SHE WAS CARRIED OUT OF THE HALL THE THICK VEIL WHICH CONCEALED HER FACE DROPPED OFF
AND WHO NO DOUBT PRACTICED UPON HIM ALL THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO USE IN VAIN ENDEAVORED TO MAKE HIM LOWER HIS EYES NOTWITHSTANDING THE DEPTH AND PROFUNDITY OF HIS GAZE AT LENGTH THE READING OF THE INDICTMENT WAS ENDED ACCUSED SAID THE PRESIDENT
PROBABLY BECAUSE THE CAPTIVES POSSESS TEETH WHICH FREQUENTLY GNAW THE BARS AND SOMETIMES THE KEEPERS ALSO IT IS A PRISON WITHIN A PRISON THE WALLS ARE DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE REST THE GRATINGS ARE EVERY DAY CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY JAILERS WHOSE HERCULEAN PROPORTIONS AND
AS HE STEPPED INTO THE OBLONG AND GRATED VEHICLE WHICH THEY CALL THE SALAD BASKET NEVER MIND WE SHALL SEE TO MORROW THEN HE ADDED TURNING TOWARDS BERTUCCIO
THE KEEPER TURNED HIS BACK AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE DID NOT EVEN LAUGH AT WHAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED ANY ONE ELSE TO DO SO HE HAD HEARD SO MANY UTTER THE SAME THINGS INDEED HE HEARD NOTHING ELSE COME SAID ANDREA YOU ARE A MAN VOID OF COMPASSION
YOUR NAME AND SURNAME ANDREA AROSE EXCUSE ME MISTER PRESIDENT HE SAID IN A CLEAR VOICE BUT I SEE YOU ARE GOING TO ADOPT A COURSE OF QUESTIONS THROUGH WHICH I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU I HAVE AN IDEA
AND WITH SO STEADFAST A LOOK THAT ANDREA WAS MOVED TO THE VERY SOUL DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO DO WITH GALLEY SLAVES OR NOVICES IN THE WORLD BENEDETTO YOU ARE FALLEN INTO TERRIBLE HANDS THEY ARE READY TO OPEN FOR YOU MAKE USE OF THEM
FRIGHTFUL THOUGH THIS SPOT MAY BE IT IS LOOKED UPON AS A KIND OF PARADISE BY THE MEN WHOSE DAYS ARE NUMBERED IT IS SO RARE FOR THEM TO LEAVE THE LIONS DEN FOR ANY OTHER PLACE
AND HE POLISHED HIS VARNISHED BOOTS WITH THE CORNER OF A HANDKERCHIEF EMBROIDERED WITH INITIALS SURMOUNTED BY A CORONET SOME OF THE INMATES OF THE LIONS DEN WERE WATCHING THE OPERATIONS OF THE PRISONER'S TOILET WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST
I'LL HAVE YOU TURNED OUT THIS MADE THE KEEPER TURN AROUND AND HE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH THE PRISONERS THEN APPROACHED AND FORMED A CIRCLE I TELL YOU THAT WITH THAT WRETCHED SUM CONTINUED ANDREA I COULD OBTAIN A COAT AND A ROOM IN WHICH TO RECEIVE THE ILLUSTRIOUS VISITOR I AM DAILY EXPECTING
OR TO THROW IN ANOTHER OUTCAST FROM SOCIETY THE COURT OF SAINT BERNARD HAS ITS OWN PARTICULAR APARTMENT FOR THE RECEPTION OF GUESTS IT IS A LONG RECTANGLE DIVIDED BY TWO UPRIGHT GRATINGS PLACED AT A DISTANCE OF THREE FEET FROM ONE ANOTHER
WHAT ARE YOU NO LONGER IN POSSESSION OF YOUR SENSES THIS STRANGE UNEXPECTED TERRIBLE ACCUSATION HAS DISORDERED YOUR REASON COME RECOVER THE PROCUREUR DROPPED HIS HEAD HIS TEETH CHATTERED LIKE THOSE OF A MAN UNDER A VIOLENT ATTACK OF FEVER AND YET HE WAS DEADLY PALE
HIS TRANSFORMATION A REVIEW OF HIS LIFE FROM THE EARLIEST PERIOD WERE SET FORTH WITH ALL THE TALENT THAT A KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN LIFE COULD FURNISH TO A MIND LIKE THAT OF THE PROCUREUR BENEDETTO WAS THUS FOREVER CONDEMNED IN PUBLIC OPINION BEFORE THE SENTENCE OF THE LAW COULD BE PRONOUNCED
THE CUT OF HIS CLOTHES WOULD HAVE MADE HIM PASS FOR AN ELEGANT MAN IF THOSE CLOTHES HAD NOT BEEN TORN TO SHREDS STILL THEY DID NOT SHOW SIGNS OF WEAR AND THE FINE CLOTH BENEATH THE CAREFUL HANDS OF THE PRISONER SOON RECOVERED ITS GLOSS IN THE PARTS WHICH WERE STILL PERFECT
OF COURSE OF COURSE SAID THE PRISONERS ANY ONE CAN SEE HE'S A GENTLEMAN
WHICH I WILL EXPLAIN BY AND BY OF MAKING AN EXCEPTION TO THE USUAL FORM OF ACCUSATION ALLOW ME THEN IF YOU PLEASE TO ANSWER IN DIFFERENT ORDER OR I WILL NOT DO SO AT ALL THE ASTONISHED PRESIDENT LOOKED AT THE JURY WHO IN TURN LOOKED AT VILLEFORT
STILL BY DEGREES NATURE OR RATHER CUSTOM HAD PREVAILED AND HE SUFFERED FROM BEING NAKED DIRTY AND HUNGRY IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT OF DISCOMFORT THAT THE INSPECTOR'S VOICE CALLED HIM TO THE VISITING ROOM ANDREA FELT HIS HEART LEAP WITH JOY
THE JUDGES TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE THE JURY TOOK THEIR SEATS
BUT WHICH THEY CAN TAKE UP AGAIN INSTANTLY IF YOU ATTEMPT TO INTERCEPT THEIR MOVEMENTS MY FATHER I WILL KNOW WHO MY FATHER IS SAID THE OBSTINATE YOUTH I WILL PERISH IF I MUST BUT I WILL KNOW IT WHAT DOES SCANDAL SIGNIFY TO ME WHAT POSSESSIONS WHAT REPUTATION
THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH
MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
I ALWAYS PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HAD PROVIDED ME WITH FIRE AND UTENSILS FOR COOKING MY LIFE AS IT PASSED THUS WAS INDEED HATEFUL TO ME AND IT WAS DURING SLEEP ALONE THAT I COULD TASTE JOY O BLESSED SLEEP
AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
SWEAR TO ME WALTON THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THAT YOU WILL SEEK HIM AND SATISFY MY VENGEANCE IN HIS DEATH AND DO I DARE TO ASK OF YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY PILGRIMAGE TO ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE NO
I TREMBLED WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION AS I SAID THIS THERE WAS A FRENZY IN MY MANNER AND SOMETHING I DOUBT NOT OF THAT HAUGHTY FIERCENESS WHICH THE MARTYRS OF OLD ARE SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED
BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE
AND PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DARED NOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR
AND JOINED MY SAD TEARS TO THEIRS ALL THIS TIME NO DISTINCT IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND
AND NEVER DEVIATING INTO INVECTIVE OR EXCLAMATION THE MAGISTRATE APPEARED AT FIRST PERFECTLY INCREDULOUS BUT AS I CONTINUED HE BECAME MORE ATTENTIVE AND INTERESTED
THE CLOUDS SWEPT ACROSS IT SWIFTER THAN THE FLIGHT OF THE VULTURE AND DIMMED HER RAYS WHILE THE LAKE REFLECTED THE SCENE OF THE BUSY HEAVENS RENDERED STILL BUSIER BY THE RESTLESS WAVES
IT RANG ON MY EARS LONG AND HEAVILY THE MOUNTAINS RE ECHOED IT AND I FELT AS IF ALL HELL SURROUNDED ME WITH MOCKERY AND LAUGHTER
AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE
MY HEART BOUNDED WITHIN ME BUT NOW WHEN I APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN GRASP OF MY FOE MY HOPES WERE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED AND I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM MORE UTTERLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAEMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN
SCARED BY THIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELF WHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIE LEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME
ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS
MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
MY RAGE AND VENGEANCE RETURNED AND LIKE A MIGHTY TIDE OVERWHELMED EVERY OTHER FEELING AFTER A SLIGHT REPOSE DURING WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD HOVERED ROUND AND INSTIGATED ME TO TOIL AND REVENGE
I SHOULD GUESS THAT I HAD PASSED THREE WEEKS IN THIS JOURNEY AND THE CONTINUAL PROTRACTION OF HOPE RETURNING BACK UPON THE HEART OFTEN WRUNG BITTER DROPS OF DESPONDENCY AND GRIEF FROM MY EYES
BUT THE DEADLY LANGUOR AND COLDNESS OF THE LIMBS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NOW HELD IN MY ARMS HAD CEASED TO BE THE ELIZABETH WHOM I HAD LOVED AND CHERISHED THE MURDEROUS MARK OF THE FIEND'S GRASP WAS ON HER NECK
WOULD SUDDENLY EXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES WHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPAST WAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT
OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE
THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAW THE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN TO YOU FIRST ENTERING ON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN
BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE
THROUGH FEAR OF HIS TERRIFIC APPEARANCE HE HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR STORE OF WINTER FOOD AND PLACING IT IN A SLEDGE TO DRAW WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON A NUMEROUS DROVE OF TRAINED DOGS
AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD AN ACCUSATION TO MAKE THAT I KNEW THE DESTROYER OF MY FAMILY AND THAT I REQUIRED HIM TO EXERT HIS WHOLE AUTHORITY FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE MURDERER
HERE LET US LEAVE HIM AND NOT SPEAK IN VAIN FOR EVEN SUCH TO HIM IS EVERY LANGUAGE AS HIS TO OTHERS WHICH TO NONE IS KNOWN THEREFORE A LONGER JOURNEY DID WE MAKE
AND THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE DIANA AND ME TO THE CONCERT IF YOU'LL LET ME GO THAT IS YOU WILL WON'T YOU MARILLA OH I FEEL SO EXCITED YOU CAN CALM DOWN THEN BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING
SHOWED SO MUCH OF HIM ABOVE IT THAT TO REACH UP TO HIS HAIR
AND WHEN THE WINGS WERE OPENED WIDE APART HE LAID FAST HOLD UPON THE SHAGGY SIDES FROM FELL TO FELL DESCENDED DOWNWARD THEN BETWEEN THE THICK HAIR AND THE FROZEN CRUST
WHO CAN SPEAK AND IS UNBOUND WHO AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL CRIME SHALL PLACE US
LOOKING AT PRISSY ANDREWS AT THE END OF EVERY SENTENCE ANNE FELT THAT SHE COULD RISE AND MUTINY ON THE SPOT IF BUT ONE ROMAN CITIZEN LED THE WAY ONLY ONE NUMBER ON THE PROGRAM FAILED TO INTEREST HER WHEN GILBERT BLYTHE RECITED
OTHERS STAND ERECT THIS WITH THE HEAD AND THAT ONE WITH THE SOLES ANOTHER BOW LIKE FACE TO FEET INVERTS WHEN IN ADVANCE SO FAR WE HAD PROCEEDED
LOOK HOW THOU STEPPEST TAKE HEED THOU DO NOT TRAMPLE WITH THY FEET THE HEADS OF THE TIRED MISERABLE BROTHERS WHEREAT I TURNED ME ROUND AND SAW BEFORE ME AND UNDERFOOT A LAKE
SUCH DID ANTAEUS SEEM TO ME WHO STOOD WATCHING TO SEE HIM STOOP AND THEN IT WAS I COULD HAVE WISHED TO GO SOME OTHER WAY BUT LIGHTLY IN THE ABYSS WHICH SWALLOWS UP JUDAS WITH LUCIFER
FOR A MOMENT MARILLA LOOKED THINGS NOT LAWFUL TO BE UTTERED THEN SHE YIELDED TO THE INEVITABLE AND SAID TARTLY VERY WELL SHE CAN GO SINCE NOTHING ELSE'LL PLEASE YOU ANNE FLEW OUT OF THE PANTRY DRIPPING DISHCLOTH IN HAND
AND IF OF ELEPHANTS AND WHALES SHE DOTH NOT REPENT HER
AT LAST THEY WERE READY CHEEKS SCARLET AND EYES GLOWING WITH EXCITEMENT TRUE ANNE COULD NOT HELP A LITTLE PANG WHEN SHE CONTRASTED HER PLAIN BLACK TAM AND SHAPELESS TIGHT SLEEVED HOMEMADE GRAY CLOTH COAT
PLACE US BELOW NOR BE DISDAINFUL OF IT
AND NOW BENEATH THE HEMISPHERE ART COME
DRAW NIGH THAT I MAY TAKE THEE THEN OF HIMSELF AND ME ONE BUNDLE MADE AS SEEMS THE CARISENDA TO BEHOLD BENEATH THE LEANING SIDE WHEN GOES A CLOUD ABOVE IT SO THAT OPPOSITE IT HANGS
OF A SMALL RIVULET THAT THERE DESCENDETH
WAS AND WAIT CARLINO TO EXONERATE ME THEN I BEHELD A THOUSAND FACES MADE PURPLE WITH COLD
WHEN WE WERE COME TO WHERE THE THIGH REVOLVES EXACTLY ON THE THICKNESS OF THE HAUNCH THE GUIDE WITH LABOUR AND WITH HARD DRAWN BREATH
IT MUST NEEDS BE THOU NAME THYSELF OR NOT A HAIR REMAIN UPON THEE HERE WHENCE HE TO ME THOUGH THOU STRIP OFF MY HAIR I WILL NOT TELL THEE WHO I AM NOR SHOW THEE

THAT WILL BE JUST ABOUT THE SAME THING AS A SERMON PLEASE MAYN'T I GO MARILLA YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID ANNE DIDN'T YOU TAKE OFF YOUR BOOTS NOW AND GO TO BED IT'S PAST EIGHT THERE'S JUST ONE MORE THING MARILLA
AND EVEN AS BREAD THROUGH HUNGER IS DEVOURED THE UPPERMOST ON THE OTHER SET HIS TEETH THERE WHERE THE BRAIN IS TO THE NAPE UNITED NOT IN ANOTHER FASHION TYDEUS GNAWED THE TEMPLES OF MENALIPPUS IN DISDAIN

MUCH LESS PAIN TWILL GIVE US IF THOU DO EAT OF US THYSELF DIDST CLOTHE US WITH THIS POOR FLESH AND DO THOU STRIP IT OFF I CALMED ME THEN NOT TO MAKE THEM MORE SAD
I'M SURE THE DEBATING CLUB IS A MOST RESPECTABLE AFFAIR PLEADED ANNE I'M NOT SAYING IT ISN'T
ANNE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE BORNE IT IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN GOING TO THE CONCERT FOR NOTHING ELSE WAS DISCUSSED THAT DAY IN SCHOOL THE AVONLEA DEBATING CLUB WHICH MET FORTNIGHTLY ALL WINTER HAD HAD SEVERAL SMALLER FREE ENTERTAINMENTS
CLAMP NEVER BOUND TOGETHER WOOD WITH WOOD SO STRONGLY WHEREAT THEY LIKE TWO HE GOATS BUTTED TOGETHER SO MUCH WRATH O'ERCAME THEM
THOU STILL IMAGINEST THOU ART BEYOND THE CENTRE WHERE I GRASPED THE HAIR OF THE FELL WORM WHO MINES THE WORLD THAT SIDE THOU WAST SO LONG AS I DESCENDED
IF I HAD NOT BEHELD THE MANACLES THEN WE PROCEEDED FARTHER IN ADVANCE
THEREFORE STOOP DOWN AND DO NOT CURL THY LIP STILL IN THE WORLD CAN HE RESTORE THY FAME BECAUSE HE LIVES AND STILL EXPECTS LONG LIFE IF TO ITSELF GRACE CALL HIM NOT UNTIMELY
WHO ART THOU THAT THUS REPREHENDEST OTHERS NOW WHO ART THOU
FOR FEAR OF HIM MADE OF THE SEA A VEIL AND CAME TO OUR HEMISPHERE AND PERADVENTURE TO FLEE FROM HIM
TRUSTING IN HIM I WAS MADE PRISONER AND AFTER PUT TO DEATH I NEED NOT SAY BUT NE'ERTHELESS WHAT THOU CANST NOT HAVE HEARD THAT IS TO SAY HOW CRUEL WAS MY DEATH
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO GAIN BY THAT TO GAIN TIME CRIED THE PRISONER IN A THUNDERING VOICE AND AT THE SAME INSTANT HE SHOOK OFF HIS BONDS THEY WERE CUT
THE PRISONER DID NOT STIR STILL MARIUS FANCIED THAT AT INTERVALS AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HE HAD HEARD A FAINT DULL NOISE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISONER ALL AT ONCE THENARDIER ADDRESSED THE PRISONER
STARED AT HIM IN STUPEFACTION AS ALMOST FREE AND IN A FORMIDABLE ATTITUDE HE BRANDISHED ABOVE HIS HEAD THE RED HOT CHISEL WHICH EMITTED A THREATENING GLOW
THIS WAS WHAT MARIUS PERCEIVED MOST CLEARLY OF ALL A SORT OF HORRIBLE FASCINATION HELD HIM NAILED TO HIS POST FROM WHICH HE WAS OBSERVING AND COMMANDING THIS WHOLE SCENE THERE HE STOOD
AND LET HER MAKE THE IMPRESSION OF HER FINGERS UPON THE WAVES RATHER THAN HIS FACE HE WAS NOT MUCH OUT IN HIS IDEAS OF THE CONSEQUENCE FOR MEETING NO OPPOSITION SHE WENT DIRECTLY OVERBOARD
AT THE SAME MOMENT HE EXTENDED HIS ARM AND LAID THE GLOWING CHISEL WHICH HE HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND BY ITS WOODEN HANDLE
REPLIED THENARDIER SINCE PONINE HAS THROWN THE STONE THROUGH THE WINDOW IT INDICATES THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT WATCHED ON THAT SIDE THE MASK WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE DEPOSITED HIS HUGE KEY ON THE FLOOR
WHEN I CAME CLOSE I PERCEIVED HER HAND MOVE I TOOK IT INTO MINE AND BROUGHT HER ON SHORE AS A CORPSE AN APOTHECARY WHO HAD JUST BEEN INSTRUCTED BY DOCTOR HAWES
THAN A REMEMBRANCE OF UDO'S APPEARANCE STARTED HIM OFF AGAIN I COULDN'T HAVE STAYED WITH HIM A MOMENT LONGER HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BURST
SO POPULAR TO ARABY WHERE HE RODE DAILY AMONG HIS FATHER'S SUBJECTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CHEERING HIM HOW AWKWARD FOR EVERYBODY ON TO EURALIA THEN
AS SHE SANK SHE FELL UPON HER SIDE AND FORCED A VERY LARGE LOBSTER TREE OUT OF ITS PLACE IT WAS IN THE SPRING WHEN THE LOBSTERS WERE VERY YOUNG
IN THIS BOX HE HIDES A WATCH SPRING AND THIS WATCH SPRING PROPERLY HANDLED CUTS GOOD SIZED CHAINS AND BARS OF IRON THE UNFORTUNATE CONVICT IS SUPPOSED TO POSSESS MERELY A SOU NOT AT ALL
CARRYING THEIR HEADS AT THE EXTREMITY OF THEIR TAILS I CROSSED CONTINUED HE ONE PRODIGIOUS RANGE OF ROCKS EQUAL IN HEIGHT TO THE ALPS THE TOPS OR HIGHEST PARTS OF THESE MARINE MOUNTAINS
THE HORRIBLE GLOWING TOOL DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT WHIRLING AS IT FLEW AND FELL FAR AWAY ON THE SNOW THE PRISONER RESUMED DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH ME HE WAS DISARMED
THEREFORE I HAD NO INCLINATION TO PROLONG THE TIME ADD TO THIS MY SITUATION WAS IN OTHER RESPECTS VERY UNPLEASANT I MET MANY LARGE FISH WHO WERE IF I COULD JUDGE BY THEIR OPEN MOUTHS
WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK THAT AFTERNOON AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN CORONEL POINTED OUT THAT AS SHE HAD TURNED PRINCE UDO INTO INTO A A QUITE SO SAID UDO
OF LONDON TREATED HER PROPERLY AND SHE RECOVERED SHE WAS THE RIB OF A MAN WHO COMMANDED A VESSEL BELONGING TO HELVOETSLUYS HE WAS JUST GOING OUT OF PORT ON A VOYAGE WHEN SHE HEARING HE HAD GOT A MISTRESS WITH HIM
ALMOST INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT OR REFLECTION AS THOUGH ANNIHILATED BY THE ABOMINABLE THINGS VIEWED AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS HE WAITED IN THE HOPE OF SOME INCIDENT NO MATTER OF WHAT NATURE
HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE THENARDIER WOMAN DID IN FACT RUSH HASTILY INTO THE ROOM RED PANTING BREATHLESS WITH FLAMING EYES AND CRIED AS SHE SMOTE HER HUGE HANDS ON HER THIGHS SIMULTANEOUSLY
THINK THAT THE LARK REALLY IS YOUR DAUGHTER
HE FOUND THIS GENTLE CREATURE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL AND LEARNED THE MEANS BY WHICH SHE CAME INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
HE WAVED AN EXPLANATORY PAW EVEN IN THE MOST HIDEOUS OF BEASTS THERE MIGHT BE A DIGNITY HE MEDITATED FOR A MOMENT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A YAK CORONEL HE ASKED NEVER
HE MIGHT GO BACK TO ARABY
HE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND BEGAN TO THINK IT OUT LEFT TO HIMSELF UDO VERY SOON MADE UP HIS MIND THERE WERE THREE COURSES OPEN TO HIM HE MIGHT STAY WHERE HE WAS TILL HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
SEIZE HIM SAID THENARDIER TWO OF THE RUFFIANS LAID THEIR HANDS ON HIS SHOULDER AND THE MASKED MAN WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE TOOK UP HIS STATION IN FRONT OF HIM
THE PRISONER UTTERED NOT A SYLLABLE AFTER A PAUSE THENARDIER CONTINUED IT'S VERY SIMPLE AS YOU SEE THERE'LL BE NO HARM DONE UNLESS YOU WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE HARM DONE
ARE TO JEWELLERS WORK WHAT THE METAPHORS OF SLANG ARE TO POETRY THERE ARE BENVENUTO CELLINIS IN THE GALLEYS
THEY ALSO FOUND A TINY SAW OF BLUE STEEL WHICH WOULD FIT THE SOU IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRISONER HAD THIS SOU PIECE ON HIS PERSON AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE RUFFIANS SEARCHED HIM THAT HE CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IT IN HIS HAND
STRIKING I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU SEE TO ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
MUST BE PERFORCE THE FRUITS OF FORMAL PRINCIPLES AND THESE SAVE ONE OF COURSE WOULD BY THY REASONING BE DESTROYED BESIDES IF RARITY WERE OF THIS DIMNESS THE CAUSE THOU ASKEST
SINCE IT MUST BE SO NOR DO I COMMEND I HELD MY PEACE BUT MY DESIRE WAS PAINTED UPON MY FACE AND QUESTIONING WITH THAT MORE FERVENT FAR THAN BY ARTICULATE SPEECH
THE HAVING HEARD WITHOUT RETAINING IT IN THE ESSENCE OF THIS SACRIFICE TWO THINGS CONVENE TOGETHER AND THE ONE IS THAT OF WHICH TIS MADE THE OTHER IS THE AGREEMENT THIS LAST FOR EVERMORE IS CANCELLED NOT
GRATEFUL TWILL BE TO ME IF THOU CONTENT ME BOTH WITH THY NAME
TO ALL THE REALM TIS PLEASING AS TO THE KING WHO MAKES HIS WILL OUR WILL AND HIS WILL IS OUR PEACE THIS IS THE SEA TO WHICH IS MOVING ONWARD WHATSOEVER IT DOTH CREATE
WHICH IS WONT TO BE THE FOUNTAIN TO THE RIVERS OF YOUR ARTS THREE MIRRORS SHALT THOU TAKE AND TWO REMOVE ALIKE FROM THEE THE OTHER MORE REMOTE BETWEEN THE FORMER TWO SHALL MEET THINE EYES
CONTINUED THUS HER HOLY ARGUMENT THE GREATEST GIFT THAT IN HIS LARGESS GOD CREATING MADE AND UNTO HIS OWN GOODNESS NEAREST CONFORMED AND THAT WHICH HE DOTH PRIZE MOST HIGHLY IS THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL
YE OTHER FEW WHO HAVE THE NECK UPLIFTED
DOTH NOT RESEMBLE THAT WHICH HERE IS SEEN BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT AS HE SPEAKS HE THINKS HE SAYS THE SOUL UNTO ITS STAR RETURNS BELIEVING IT TO HAVE BEEN SEVERED THENCE WHENEVER NATURE GAVE IT AS A FORM
THAT MY CONFESSION I REMEMBERED NOT SUCH AS THROUGH POLISHED AND TRANSPARENT GLASS OR WATERS CRYSTALLINE AND UNDISTURBED BUT NOT SO DEEP AS THAT THEIR BED BE LOST COME BACK AGAIN THE OUTLINES OF OUR FACES SO FEEBLE
UNLESS COMPLIED WITH AND CONCERNING THIS WITH SUCH PRECISION HAS ABOVE BEEN SPOKEN THEREFORE IT WAS ENJOINED UPON THE HEBREWS TO OFFER STILL THOUGH SOMETIMES WHAT WAS OFFERED MIGHT BE COMMUTED AS THOU OUGHT'ST TO KNOW THE OTHER
BEATRICE DID AS DANIEL HAD DONE RELIEVING NEBUCHADNEZZAR FROM THE WRATH WHICH RENDERED HIM UNJUSTLY MERCILESS AND SAID WELL SEE I HOW ATTRACTETH THEE ONE AND THE OTHER WISH
WELL I PERCEIVE THAT NEVER SATED IS OUR INTELLECT UNLESS THE TRUTH ILLUME IT BEYOND WHICH NOTHING TRUE EXPANDS ITSELF IT RESTS THEREIN AS WILD BEAST IN HIS LAIR WHEN IT ATTAINS IT
SHE HEAVENWARD TURNED AGAIN HER FACE PARADISO CANTO TWO
IF IN THE HEAT OF LOVE I FLAME UPON THEE BEYOND THE MEASURE THAT ON EARTH IS SEEN SO THAT THE VALOUR OF THINE EYES I VANQUISH MARVEL THOU NOT THEREAT FOR THIS PROCEEDS FROM PERFECT SIGHT
BROUGHT FORTH THE THIRD AND LATEST PUISSANCE THUS UNTO ME SHE SPAKE AND THEN BEGAN AVE MARIA SINGING AND IN SINGING VANISHED AS THROUGH DEEP WATER SOMETHING HEAVY
WHO FROM ABOVE DESCENDS BECAUSE IN DRAWING NEAR TO ITS DESIRE OUR INTELLECT INGULPHS ITSELF SO FAR THAT AFTER IT THE MEMORY CANNOT GO TRULY
IF THIS WERE CAUSED BY RARE AND DENSE ALONE ONE ONLY VIRTUE WOULD THERE BE IN ALL OR MORE OR LESS DIFFUSED OR EQUALLY VIRTUES DIVERSE
WHATEVER OF THE HOLY REALM I HAD THE POWER TO TREASURE IN MY MIND SHALL NOW BECOME THE SUBJECT OF MY SONG O GOOD APOLLO FOR THIS LAST EMPRISE MAKE OF ME SUCH A VESSEL OF THY POWER
THERE MUCH IS LAWFUL WHICH IS HERE UNLAWFUL UNTO OUR POWERS BY VIRTUE OF THE PLACE MADE FOR THE HUMAN SPECIES AS ITS OWN NOT LONG I BORE IT NOR SO LITTLE WHILE BUT
SUFFICE HIM FOR WHOM GRACE THE EXPERIENCE RESERVES IF I WAS MERELY WHAT OF ME THOU NEWLY CREATEDST LOVE WHO GOVERNEST THE HEAVEN THOU KNOWEST WHO DIDST LIFT ME WITH THY LIGHT
BUT BY THAT ONE WHICH CIRCLES FOUR UNITETH WITH THREE CROSSES WITH BETTER COURSE AND WITH A BETTER STAR CONJOINED IT ISSUES AND THE MUNDANE WAX TEMPERS AND STAMPS MORE AFTER ITS OWN FASHION
MY SIGHT THAT FOLLOWED HER
THEREAFTER ANSWERED ME SO FULL OF GLADNESS SHE SEEMED TO BURN IN THE FIRST FIRE OF LOVE BROTHER OUR WILL IS QUIETED BY VIRTUE OF CHARITY
AND UNITES THE EARTH NOR ONLY THE CREATED THINGS THAT ARE WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE THIS BOW SHOOTS FORTH BUT THOSE THAT HAVE BOTH INTELLECT AND LOVE THE PROVIDENCE THAT REGULATES ALL THIS
TOWARDS ME TURNING BLITHE AS BEAUTIFUL SAID UNTO ME FIX GRATEFULLY THY MIND ON GOD WHO UNTO THE FIRST STAR HAS BROUGHT US
BECAUSE THEY CORUSCATE WHEN THOU DOST SMILE BUT KNOW NOT WHO THOU ART NOR WHY THOU HAST SPIRIT AUGUST THY STATION IN THE SPHERE THAT VEILS ITSELF TO MEN IN ALIEN RAYS
MAKES WITH ITS LIGHT THE HEAVEN FOREVER QUIET WHEREIN THAT TURNS WHICH HAS THE GREATEST HASTE AND THITHER NOW AS TO A SITE DECREED BEARS US AWAY THE VIRTUE OF THAT CORD
SINCE FROM ABOVE THEY TAKE AND ACT BENEATH OBSERVE ME WELL HOW THROUGH THIS PLACE I COME UNTO THE TRUTH THOU WISHEST THAT HEREAFTER THOU MAYST ALONE KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE FORD
EVERYBODY LOVED HER AND SHE LOVED EVERYBODY ESPECIALLY KATY WHOM SHE LOOKED UP TO AS ONE OF THE WISEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD PRETTY LITTLE PHIL SAT NEXT ON THE ROOF TO CLOVER AND SHE HELD HIM TIGHT WITH HER ARM
TO BE GUIDED IN SELECTING REBELS FOR PUNISHMENT IS PERFECTLY OBVIOUS THE RINGLEADERS THE MEN OF RANK FORTUNE AND EDUCATION WHOSE POWER AND WHOSE ARTIFICES HAVE LED THE MULTITUDE INTO ERROR ARE THE PROPER OBJECTS OF SEVERITY THE DELUDED POPULACE
AND HE COULD FORFEIT NO MORE INTEREST THAN HE HAD IF HE DIED HIS LANDS AT ONCE DEVOLVED ON THE NEXT HEIR IF HE WERE PARDONED
YES I SAID WITH ASSURANCE I COULD EAT SOME MUTTON BUT SAID HE WITH A MOMENTARY HESITATION YOU KNOW I'M DYING TO HEAR OF HOW YOU CAME TO BE ALONE IN THAT BOAT DAMN THAT HOWLING
NARROW WINDING PATHS RAN HERE AND THERE MADE BY THE CATTLE AS THEY WANDERED TO AND FRO THIS PLACE THE CHILDREN CALLED PARADISE AND TO THEM
WHICH ALWAYS LOOKED READY TO LAUGH THESE TWO WERE GREAT FRIENDS THOUGH DORRY SEEMED LIKE A GIRL WHO HAD GOT INTO BOY'S CLOTHES BY MISTAKE AND JOHNNIE LIKE A BOY WHO IN A FIT OF FUN HAD BORROWED HIS SISTER'S FROCK
WAVED A WILD ROSE BUSH BUDDED OVER WITH FRESH GREEN EAVES THIS ROSARY WAS A FASCINATING THING TO THEIR MINDS THEY WERE ALWAYS INVENTING STORIES ABOUT IT AND WERE IN CONSTANT TERROR
ALWAYS NEVER AUNTY BOYS AND GIRLS WILL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE LITTLE CARRS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD EVER HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
AND BATTER PUDDINGS NOT BOILED ONES YOU KNOW BUT LITTLE BAKED ONES WITH BROWN SHINY TOPS AND A GREAT DEAL OF PUDDING SAUCE TO EAT ON THEM
THEIR EYES SEEMED TO BE WEAK FOR THEY BOTH WORE BLACK GOGGLES THEY HAD SIX LEGS APIECE TWO SHORT ONES TWO NOT SO SHORT AND TWO VERY LONG
SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO BELONG EXACTLY TO EITHER THE OLDER OR THE YOUNGER CHILDREN THE GREAT DESIRE AND AMBITION OF HER HEART
WHEN KATE AND AUNT IZZIE WERE WILLING THEY HAD ONLY TO CLIMB A PAIR OF BARS VERY EASY ONES AND WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF AN ANGEL WITH FLAMING SWORD TO STOP THE WAY
TWO RED ONES A YELLOW ONE WITH SHARP HORNS TIPPED WITH TIN AND A DEAR LITTLE WHITE ONE NAMED DAISY THERE WERE SIX OF THE CARR CHILDREN FOUR GIRLS AND TWO BOYS KATY THE OLDEST WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER THE LONG WINTER WHO KNEW WHAT THE FAIRIES MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE SINCE ANY OF THEM HAD BEEN THERE TO SEE WHICH PATH SHALL WE GO IN BY ASKED CLOVER AT LAST SUPPOSE WE VOTE SAID KATY
HE HAD INSTIGATED MONMOUTH FIRST TO INVADE THE KINGDOM AND THEN TO USURP THE CROWN IT WAS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT A STRICT SEARCH WOULD BE MADE FOR THE ARCHTRAITOR AS HE WAS OFTEN CALLED
AND THERE WERE SPOTS OF BLOOD ON THE GUNWALE AT THE SAME TIME MY EYE CAUGHT MY HAND SO THIN THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A DIRTY SKIN PURSE FULL OF LOOSE BONES AND ALL THE BUSINESS OF THE BOAT CAME BACK TO ME
LEFT IT ALL HE SAID TEN YEARS AGO HOW JOLLY IT ALL USED TO BE BUT I MADE A YOUNG ASS OF MYSELF
THE RANK WHICH HE HAD INHERITED IN THE STATE AND THE HIGH COMMAND WHICH HE HAD BORNE IN THE REBEL ARMY
LIKE A SATISFIED KITTEN CLOVER WAS SUNNY AND SWEET TEMPERED A LITTLE INDOLENT AND VERY MODEST ABOUT HERSELF THOUGH IN FACT SHE WAS PARTICULARLY CLEVER IN ALL SORTS OF GAMES
WHEN ONCE THE SLAUGHTER ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE IS OVER CAN SCARCELY BE TREATED TOO LENIENTLY THIS RULE SO EVIDENTLY AGREEABLE TO JUSTICE AND HUMANITY WAS NOT ONLY NOT OBSERVED IT WAS INVERTED
BUT JOHNNIE HAD NO CLEAR IDEAS AS TO HER FUTURE SHE LAUGHED A GREAT DEAL AND SQUEEZED DORRY'S ARM VERY TIGHT BUT THAT WAS ALL DORRY WAS MORE EXPLICIT I MEAN TO HAVE TURKEY EVERY DAY HE DECLARED
I AM SORRY TO SAY THEY RAN AWAY FROM HER WHICH AS THEIR LEGS WERE LONGEST IT WAS EASY TO DO
RABBIT HOLLOW AND THE REST THE SUN WAS JUST OVER THEIR HEADS AND IT WAS NOON I'M GETTING HUNGRY SAID DORRY OH NO DORRY YOU MUSTN'T BE HUNGRY TILL THE BOWER IS READY CRIED THE LITTLE GIRLS ALARMED FOR DORRY WAS APT TO BE DISCONSOLATE
AND OPENING HIS BIG MOUTH
BY AND BY JOHN AND DORRY TROTTED AWAY ON MYSTERIOUS ERRANDS OF THEIR OWN WASN'T DORRY FUNNY WITH HIS TURKEY REMARKED CECY AND THEY ALL LAUGHED AGAIN IF YOU WON'T TELL SAID KATY I'LL LET YOU SEE DORRY'S JOURNAL
WHICH WERE TIED TO THE VERY POPLAR TREE
THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING SO LONG AS I WAS THERE BUT THE MOMENT MY BACK WAS TURNED THEY BEGAN TO QUARREL AGAIN AND IN THE SAME OLD WORDS KATY DID KATY DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T
IN PLACE OF THIS MAMMA WHOM THEY RECOLLECTED SO DIMLY THERE WAS AUNT IZZIE PAPA'S SISTER WHO CAME TO TAKE CARE OF THEM WHEN MAMMA WENT AWAY ON THAT LONG JOURNEY FROM WHICH FOR SO MANY MONTHS
HE HAD WATERY GREY EYES ODDLY VOID OF EXPRESSION THEN JUST OVERHEAD
OR PERHAPS ON THE VERY TOP STEP OF THE SCUTTLE LADDER SHE SPIED THE LITTLE PAPER BOX WITH ITS LOAD OF NOTES ALL ENDING WITH BE SURE AND NOT LET ELSIE KNOW THEN SHE WOULD SEIZE THE BOX AND MARCHING UP TO WHEREVER THE OTHERS WERE
I THINK I SAID I FELT ALL RIGHT
SPOKEN ON SUNDAY AND AT PRAYER TIMES
AS IF TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE EATEN I DON'T KNOW REPLIED KATY DREAMILY SHE HAD LEFT HER SEAT
THEN SANTA CLAUS WAKED UP THE FAIRY AND TOLD HER THAT IF SHE DIDN'T TAKE BETTER CARE OF ROSY POSY HE SHOULD PUT SOME OTHER FAIRY INTO HER PLACE AND SET HER TO KEEP GUARD OVER A PRICKLY SCRATCHY BLACKBERRY BUSH
AND ROSE IN HIS TURN WITH A NERVOUS MOVEMENT HE COULD NOT REPRESS THE DAY HOWEVER PASSED AWAY AND THE EVENING CAME ON SLOWLY BUT FINALLY IT CAME THE BARS WERE FILLED WITH DRINKERS
ARAMIS MUMBLED VERSES TO HIMSELF AND PORTHOS FROM TIME TO TIME PULLED A HAIR OR TWO FROM HIS MUSTACHE IN SIGN OF DESPAIR BUT ALL AT ONCE A SHADOW APPEARED IN THE DARKNESS THE OUTLINE OF WHICH WAS FAMILIAR TO D'ARTAGNAN AND A WELL KNOWN VOICE SAID
YOU WILL FURTHER SAY TO HIM WATCH OVER HIS GRACE LORD BUCKINGHAM FOR THEY WISH TO ASSASSINATE HIM BUT THIS PLANCHET IS SO SERIOUS AND IMPORTANT THAT I HAVE NOT INFORMED MY FRIENDS THAT I WOULD ENTRUST THIS SECRET TO YOU AND FOR A CAPTAIN'S COMMISSION I WOULD NOT WRITE IT
HERE AGAIN ARE THE TUFTED HAT THE BEARDED FACE AND THE FEATURES OF THE PICTURE OF SAINT MALO ON THE BACK OF THE WOOD THE DEEPLY GRAVEN INITIALS J C SEEMED TO PROVE
STILL FURTHER HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE WORTHY PICARD AT ONE TIME SO GREAT DIMINISHED DAY BY DAY
WHOSE NAME IS ASSOCIATED FOR ALL TIME WITH THE PROUD TITLE OF DISCOVERER OF CANADA THE PICTURE IS THAT OF A BEARDED MAN IN THE PRIME OF LIFE STANDING ON THE DECK OF A SHIP HIS BENT ELBOW RESTING UPON THE GUNWALE
WHO WAS AN OPTIMIST WHEN THINGS WERE CONCERNED AND A PESSIMIST WHEN MEN WERE IN QUESTION THEY WILL PROMISE EVERYTHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE MONEY AND ON THE ROAD FEAR WILL PREVENT THEM FROM ACTING ONCE TAKEN THEY WILL BE PRESSED WHEN PRESSED THEY WILL CONFESS EVERYTHING
IN THE MORNING AS HE WAS MOUNTING HIS HORSE D'ARTAGNAN WHO FELT AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART A PARTIALITY FOR THE DUKE TOOK PLANCHET ASIDE
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN A WOMAN OF MARK SAID PORTHOS WITH HIS LOUD LAUGH
YOU SHALL SEE IF CONFIDENCE CAN BE PLACED IN ME MOUNTED ON AN EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS TO LEAVE AT THE END OF TWENTY LEAGUES IN ORDER TO TAKE THE POST
WITH PRECISELY THE FACE AND BEARING WHICH THE HERO WORSHIPPER WOULD READ INTO THE CHARACTER OF SUCH A DISCOVERER THE PORT OF SAINT MALO THE BIRTHPLACE AND THE HOME OF CARTIER IS SITUATED IN THE OLD PROVINCE OF BRITTANY
IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE CONTENT WITH THE PICTURE WHICH HANGS IN THE TOWN HALL OF THE SEAPORT OF SAINT MALO IF IT DOES NOT SHOW US CARTIER AS HE WAS AND WE HAVE NO ABSOLUTE PROOF IN THE ONE OR THE OTHER DIRECTION
AND ME TOO SAID D'ARTAGNAN AND ME TOO SAID PORTHOS AND ME TOO SAID ARAMIS
MY DEAR ARAMIS YOU HAVE THE PEN OF A SECRETARY OF STATE LORD DE WINTER WILL NOW BE UPON HIS GUARD IF THE LETTER SHOULD REACH HIM AND EVEN IF IT SHOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE CARDINAL WE SHALL NOT BE COMPROMISED
MY COUSIN MY SISTER AND I ARE SKILLFUL IN INTERPRETING DREAMS AND EVEN ENTERTAIN GREAT FEAR OF THEM BUT OF YOURS IT MAY BE SAID I HOPE EVERY DREAM IS AN ILLUSION ADIEU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
D'ARTAGNAN PASSED THE DAY IN EXHIBITING HIS MUSKETEER'S UNIFORM IN EVERY STREET OF THE CAMP IN THE EVENING AT THE APPOINTED HOUR THE FOUR FRIENDS MET THERE ONLY REMAINED THREE THINGS TO DECIDE
REPUDIATED BY HER HUSBAND SAID ATHOS BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN BRANDED CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN BAH CRIED PORTHOS IMPOSSIBLE WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT SHE WANTED TO HAVE HER BROTHER IN LAW KILLED YES
NEFFER NEFFER
AS IT MUST HAVE BEEN MADE LONG BEFORE THE SAINT MALO PORTRAIT WAS PAINTED THE RESEMBLANCE OF THE TWO FACES PERHAPS INDICATES THE EXISTENCE OF SOME DEFINITE AND GENUINE PORTRAIT OF JACQUES CARTIER OF WHICH THE RECORD HAS BEEN LOST
D'ARTAGNAN ALREADY WORE HIS UNIFORM FOR BEING NEARLY OF THE SAME SIZE AS ARAMIS AND AS ARAMIS WAS SO LIBERALLY PAID BY THE PUBLISHER WHO PURCHASED HIS POEM AS TO ALLOW HIM TO BUY EVERYTHING DOUBLE HE SOLD HIS FRIEND A COMPLETE OUTFIT
THIS IS THE PICTURE THAT APPEARS IN THE FORM OF A MEDALLION OR RING SHAPED ILLUSTRATION IN MORE THAN ONE OF THE MODERN WORKS UPON THE GREAT ADVENTURER BUT HERE AGAIN WE HAVE NO PROOFS OF IDENTITY
MILADY HAD HIM ONE DAY TURNED OUT OF DOORS WITH SUNDRY BLOWS OF A GOOD STICK TO ACCELERATE HIS MOTIONS NOW PLANCHET HAS AN EXCELLENT MEMORY AND I WILL BE BOUND THAT SOONER THAN RELINQUISH ANY POSSIBLE MEANS OF VENGEANCE HE WILL ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE BEATEN TO DEATH
ADORNED HIS HEAD WITH A CARDINAL'S HAT BUT AS WE HAVE SAID BAZIN HAD NOT BY HIS FORTUNATE RETURN REMOVED MORE THAN A PART OF THE UNEASINESS WHICH WEIGHED UPON THE FOUR FRIENDS THE DAYS OF EXPECTATION ARE LONG
AND SMILING ACCORDING TO CUSTOM ENTERED THE CABARET OF THE PARPAILLOT AS THE FOUR FRIENDS WERE SITTING DOWN TO BREAKFAST SAYING AS HAD BEEN AGREED UPON
AND BE A GOOD LAD REMEMBER IF YOU TALK IF YOU BABBLE IF YOU GET DRUNK YOU RISK YOUR MASTER'S HEAD WHO HAS SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN YOUR FIDELITY AND WHO ANSWERS FOR YOU
SAINT MALO BECAME FAMOUS AS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CORSAIRS OF THE NORTHERN COAST THESE HAD SUCCEEDED THE VIKINGS OF AN EARLIER DAY AND THEY SHOWED A HARDIHOOD AND A RECKLESS DARING EQUAL TO THAT OF THEIR PREDECESSORS LATER ON
HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO MY WAYS AND I AM PARTICULAR YESTERDAY'S AFFAIR MUST HAVE SHAKEN HIM A LITTLE HIS VOYAGE WOULD UPSET HIM QUITE PLANCHET WAS SENT FOR AND INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN HIM THE MATTER HAD BEEN NAMED TO HIM BY D'ARTAGNAN WHO IN THE FIRST PLACE POINTED OUT THE MONEY TO HIM
LET US GIVE HIM ONLY HALF THE SUM PROMISED HIM WITH THE LETTER WITH AN AGREEMENT THAT HE SHALL HAVE THE OTHER HALF IN EXCHANGE FOR THE REPLY
IN A BAPTISMAL REGISTER OF SAINT MALO IS RECORDED THE CHRISTENING IN FIFTEEN TWENTY EIGHT OF A CERTAIN CATHERINE OF BREZIL TO WHOM CARTIER'S WIFE STOOD GODMOTHER WE MAY
THE SON OF HIS SISTER JEHANNE STRANGELY ENOUGH THIS PROVED TO BE ONLY THE FIRST OF A GREAT MANY SACRED CEREMONIES OF THIS SORT IN WHICH HE TOOK PART THERE IS A RECORD OF MORE THAN FIFTY BAPTISMS AT SAINT MALO
THEN THE GLORY AND THEN THE DANGER
OTHERWISE IF THERE IS NO SUCH UNIVERSAL NECESSITY NEITHER CAN ANY PRECONCEPTION BE A SIGN OF A NECESSITY WHICH EXISTS NOT
MY DEAR SIR THE FACTS DETAILED IN MY LAST LETTER WILL SATISFY YOU AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE INCREASE OF MASS IN AN ANIMAL THAT IS ITS GROWTH IS ACCOMPLISHED
IF IT BUT REFLECT AGAIN LIKE A GLASS THINGS FALSE AND VAIN
OF THE NERVES AND BRAIN AND OF THE ORGANIC PART OF CARTILAGES AND BONES BUT THE BLOOD MUST BE SUPPLIED TO IT PERFECT IN EVERYTHING BUT ITS FORM THAT IS IN ITS CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
IN ANOTHER BY PURE INTELLIGENCE SENSE JUDGES FIGURE CLOTHED IN MATERIAL SUBSTANCE IMAGINATION FIGURE ALONE WITHOUT MATTER THOUGHT TRANSCENDS THIS AGAIN
BUT ALONG WITH THIS NITROGEN
I INQUIRE INTO THE REASONS WHY THOU ART DISSATISFIED WITH THE SOLUTION PROPOSED WHICH IS TO THE EFFECT THAT
BUT SURVEYING ALL THINGS SO TO SPEAK UNDER THE ASPECT OF PURE FORM BY A SINGLE FLASH OF INTUITION THOUGHT ALSO
YET NO ONE HAS HAD DILIGENCE AND PERSEVERANCE ENOUGH TO FIND A SOLUTION AND THE REASON OF THIS OBSCURITY IS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF HUMAN REASONING CANNOT COPE
WHEREAS IF THERE IS NO NECESSITY THEY CAN BY NO MEANS BE FOREKNOWN AND THOU THINKEST THAT NOTHING CAN BE GRASPED AS KNOWN UNLESS IT IS CERTAIN BUT IF THINGS WHOSE OCCURRENCE IS UNCERTAIN ARE FOREKNOWN AS CERTAIN
AND TO SEE WHAT FOLLOWS WE ASSUME THAT THERE IS NO FOREKNOWLEDGE ARE WILLED ACTIONS THEN TIED DOWN TO ANY NECESSITY IN THIS CASE CERTAINLY NOT
THE EYE OF INTELLIGENCE IS YET MORE EXALTED
WHILE IN THE BODY OF A STARVING OR SICK INDIVIDUAL THE FAT DISAPPEARS AND THE MUSCULAR TISSUE TAKES ONCE MORE THE FORM OF BLOOD WE FIND THAT THE TENDONS AND MEMBRANES RETAIN THEIR NATURAL CONDITION
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS IN WHICH VITALITY RESIDES IS IN THE CARNIVOROUS ANIMAL DEPENDENT ON THE SUPPLY OF A SUBSTANCE
THE HORSE RECEIVES RATHER LESS THAN THE FIFTH PART OF THE CARBON WHICH HIS ORGANISM REQUIRES FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS AND WE SEE THAT THE WISDOM OF THE CREATOR HAS ADDED TO HIS FOOD THE FOUR FIFTHS WHICH ARE WANTING
WHICH CANNOT POSSIBLY BE EMPLOYED IN THE PRODUCTION OF BLOOD
AS THOU WERT READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE JUST NOW THE FACT OF FOREKNOWLEDGE IMPOSES NO NECESSITY ON THINGS FUTURE WHAT REASON IS THERE FOR SUPPOSING THE RESULTS OF VOLUNTARY ACTION CONSTRAINED TO A FIXED ISSUE SUPPOSE FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT
THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN CONSUMED AND AS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE THE AMOUNT OF CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OUT BY THE ANIMAL ARE MUCH GREATER THAN IN THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN MAN BUT AN ADULT MAN CONSUMES DAILY ABUT FOURTEEN OZ OF CARBON
THIS FACT PRESUPPOSES
A PROGRESSIVE ALTERATION A PART OF THESE TISSUES IS SEPARATED AND MUST BE RESTORED FROM THE BLOOD BUT THIS ALTERATION AND RESTORATION ARE OBVIOUSLY CONFINED WITHIN VERY NARROW LIMITS
WHILE ONLY THE BONE EARTH IS FOUND IN HIS EXCREMENTS THE SAME IS TRUE OF MAN WHEN FED ON FOOD RICH IN GELATINE AS FOR EXAMPLE STRONG SOUP THE GELATINE IS NOT TO BE FOUND EITHER IN THE URINE OR IN THE FAECES AND CONSEQUENTLY
MUST GO ON FAR LESS RAPIDLY THAN IN THE CARNIVORA WERE THIS NOT THE CASE A VEGETATION A THOUSAND TIMES MORE LUXURIANT THAN THE ACTUAL ONE WOULD NOT SUFFICE FOR THEIR NOURISHMENT SUGAR GUM AND STARCH WOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT LIFE IN THESE ANIMALS
HOW CLOSE THE CONNECTION IS BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN SPECIES THE CULTIVATION OF OUR CROPS HAS ULTIMATELY NO OTHER OBJECT THAN THE PRODUCTION OF A MAXIMUM OF THOSE SUBSTANCES
IS FORCED TO MAKE THE MOST LABORIOUS EXERTIONS AND GO THROUGH A VAST AMOUNT OF MUSCULAR EXERCISE HE IS COMPELLED TO CONSUME FORCE MERELY IN ORDER TO SUPPLY MATTER FOR RESPIRATION CULTIVATION IS THE ECONOMY OF FORCE
THE ELEMENTS OF THESE SUBSTANCES UNITE WITH THE OXYGEN THE ORGANS THEMSELVES COULD NOT DO SO WITHOUT BEING CONSUMED THAT IS GROWTH OR INCREASE OF MASS IN THE BODY THE CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN REMAINING THE SAME WOULD BE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE
AND WITH GIVEN MEANS TO PRODUCE A MAXIMUM OF FORCE THE UNPROFITABLE EXERTION OF POWER THE WASTE OF FORCE IN AGRICULTURE IN OTHER BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY IN SCIENCE OR IN SOCIAL ECONOMY
ON THE SMOOTH UNSULLIED WHITE OF THE PAPER'S FACE SO DO OUTER THINGS IMPRESS IMAGES ON CONSCIOUSNESS BUT IF VERILY THE MIND THUS ALL PASSIVE LIES IF NO LIVING POWER WITHIN ITS OWN FORCE SUPPLIES
WHEN WE CONSIDER THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ALBUMEN OF THE BLOOD INTO A PART OF AN ORGAN COMPOSED OF FIBRINE THE IDENTITY IN COMPOSITION OF THE TWO SUBSTANCES RENDERS THE CHANGE EASILY CONCEIVABLE INDEED
THEY AGAIN RECEIVE THIS FOOD UNACCOMPANIED BY THOSE COMPOUNDS DESTITUTE OF NITROGEN WHICH DURING THE LIFE OF THE ANIMALS SERVED TO SUPPORT THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN SUCH MEN
NOW THE CIRCULATION IN THE YOUNG ANIMAL IS NOT WEAKER BUT ON THE CONTRARY MORE RAPID THE RESPIRATIONS ARE MORE FREQUENT AND FOR EQUAL BULKS THE CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN MUST BE GREATER RATHER THAN SMALLER IN THE YOUNG THAN IN THE ADULT ANIMAL
WERE NOT ABOUT TO HAPPEN INSTEAD OF OUR SUPPOSING THAT ALTHOUGH THEY SHOULD COME TO PASS YET THERE WAS NO NECESSITY INVOLVED IN THEIR OWN NATURE COMPELLING THEIR OCCURRENCE
THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG ANIMAL ITS MUSCULAR FIBRE CELLULAR TISSUE NERVOUS MATTER AND BONES MUST HAVE DERIVED THEIR ORIGIN FROM THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENT OF MILK THE CASEINE FOR BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK CONTAIN NO NITROGEN
MUST BE DIMINISHED AS WELL IN THE STOMACH AS IN ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY IN THIS CONDITION THE UNIFORM EXPERIENCE OF PRACTICAL PHYSICIANS SHOWS THAT GELATINOUS MATTERS IN A DISSOLVED STATE EXERCISE A MOST DECIDED INFLUENCE ON THE STATE OF THE HEALTH
HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE BLACKY THE CROW THAT I SUPPOSE THIS IS WHY THEY CALL HIM CROW BLACKBIRD
AS HE DREW NEARER TO IT IT SOUNDED LOUDER AND LOUDER PRESENTLY PETER STOPPED TO TRY TO LOCATE EXACTLY THE PLACE WHERE THAT SOUND WHICH NOW WAS MORE THAN EVER LIKE THUNDER WAS COMING FROM
A HEAD WITH A PAIR OF THE BRIGHTEST EYES WAS RAISED A LITTLE
WHY WHY EE EXCLAIMED PETER RUBBING HIS EYES WITH ASTONISHMENT HE ISN'T JUST BLACK HE'S BEAUTIFUL SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL AND I'VE ALWAYS SUPPOSED HE WAS JUST PLAIN HOMELY BLACK
LIKE THE BLACK AGAINST BULLETS WHICH HE SAID CAME TOO MUCH FASTER FASTER TO TOP AND AS THE SAVAGE MADE THE BLOW AT ME I FOLLOWED OUT JIMMY'S TACTICS THREW MYSELF FORWARD
AND TO MY GREAT JOY I FELT MORE MYSELF AT LAST AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF INCOMPREHENSIBLE CHATTER IT SEEMED THAT A DECISION HAD BEEN COME TO ABOUT ME
ON HIS WAY HE PASSED A CERTAIN BIG TREE ALL AROUND THE GROUND WAS CARPETED WITH BROWN DEAD LEAVES THERE WERE NO BUSHES OR YOUNG TREES THERE
CASTING GLANCES BEHIND ME FROM TIME TO TIME AND SEEING THAT
AND SPREAD IT UNTIL IT WAS LIKE AN OPEN FAN ABOVE HIS BACK THE OUTER EDGE WAS GRAY THEN CAME A BROAD BAND OF BLACK FOLLOWED BY BANDS OF GRAY BROWN AND BLACK
HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY THAT IT WASN'T BLACKY BECAUSE IT WAS SO MUCH SMALLER BEING NOT MORE THAN HALF AS BIG IT'S CREAKER THE GRACKLE
I WAS PANTING HEAVILY AND A CHOKING SENSATION CAME UPON ME BUT I RACED ON SINCE IT WAS FOR LIFE HOW LONG THE PURSUIT LASTED I CANNOT TELL PERHAPS A MINUTE
IT WAS A SOUND VERY LIKE DISTANT THUNDER IT BEGAN SLOWLY AT FIRST AND THEN WENT FASTER AND FASTER BOOM BOOM BOOM
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN SAMMY JAY AND BLACKY THE CROW CREAKER CHUCKLED BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE AT ALL OFFENDED JUST THEN HE HEARD MISSUS CREAKER CALLING HIM AND WITH A HASTY
IF THEY DO I CERTAINLY WILL HAVE A FAMILY TO BE PROUD OF MEANWHILE PETER HURRIED ON IN HIS USUAL HAPPY GO LUCKY FASHION UNTIL HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST
IT WAS TRUE CREAKER THE GRACKLE WITH THE SUN SHINING ON HIM WAS TRULY BEAUTIFUL HIS HEAD AND NECK HIS THROAT AND UPPER BREAST WERE A SHINING BLUE BLACK WHILE HIS BACK WAS A RICH SHINING BRASSY GREEN
LAY THE SEA WITH OUR SCHOONER BUT THE OTHER WAS GONE
AND I REMEMBER THAT MISSUS GROUSE ONCE TOLD ME THAT THAT IS STRUTTER'S THUNDER LOG VERY VERY CAREFULLY PETER STOLE FORWARD MAKING NO SOUND AT ALL
IT IS ENOUGH TO SCARE ANYBODY BUT I'LL TRY AND LET THEM SEE THAT I BELONG TO A SUPERIOR RACE AND WILL NOT SHOW WHAT I FEEL MY EYES KEPT WANDERING ABOUT EAGERLY FIRST TO LOOK WHERE MY COMPANIONS
HIS WINGS AND TAIL WERE MUCH LIKE HIS HEAD AND NECK
IN ONE OF THOSE PINE TREES ON THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST AND I EXPECT ANY DAY NOW WE WILL HAVE FOUR HUNGRY BABIES TO FEED I SHALL HAVE TO GET BUSY THEN YOU KNOW I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT EVERY FATHER
STRETCHED HIMSELF TO HIS FULL HEIGHT AND HIS WINGS BEGAN TO BEAT FIRST SLOWLY THEN FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL THEY WERE JUST A BLUR THEY SEEMED TO TOUCH ABOVE HIS BACK BUT WHEN THEY CAME DOWN THEY DIDN'T QUITE STRIKE HIS SIDES
GOBBLER THE BIG TURKEY COCK
AND TAUGHT ME HOW TO CATCH THE SPEAR ON A SHIELD AND TO AVOID BLOWS MADE WITH WADDIES JIMMY'S LESSONS WERE NOT THROWN AWAY I COULD AVOID A THROWN SPEAR THOUGH HELPLESS
PETER RATHER TIMIDLY CREAKER SHOOK HIS HEAD NOT QUITE SAID HE SHE LIKES PLAIN BLACK BETTER
SHOULD DO HIS FULL SHARE IN TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY IT DECLARED PETER NODDING HIS HEAD WITH APPROVAL
AT MY HEAD IF THAT BLOW HAD TAKEN EFFECT I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL
THERE WERE FOUR WHO WERE PRETTY CLOSE UPON MY HEELS ONE OF WHOM HURLED
HENYARD IN THE MOST STATELY WAY YOU CAN IMAGINE STRUTTER WALKED THE LENGTH OF THAT MOSSY LOG
BIRDS I WOULD CHANGE COATS WITH
TO GOSSIP BUT FINDING STRUTTER MORE INTERESTED IN THUNDERING THAN IN TALKING HE ONCE MORE STARTED FOR HOME
ASKED PETER EAGERLY ATTENDING TO HER HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS AS A GOOD HOUSEWIFE SHOULD RETORTED STRUTTER PROMPTLY DO YOU MEAN SHE HAS A NEST AND EGGS ASKED PETER
I KNEW THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN BURNED TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND THEN SUNK I BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FATE OF THE OTHER SCHOONER'S CREW
THEN I BEGAN TO THINK OF MY MOTHER AND FATHER HOW I SHOULD HAVE FAILED IN HELPING THEM AND I REMEMBER THINKING WHAT A GOOD JOB IT WAS THAT MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME
IT MAY OR IT MAY NOT BE NEAR HERE DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ME THUNDER AGAIN OF COURSE PETER SAID HE DID AND THAT WAS SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR STRUTTER TO SHOW OFF PETER STAYED A WHILE LONGER
IF I DO SAY IT MYSELF
IN WHICH WERE VESSELS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION FROM SAUCE PAN TO SILVER CUP PRESSING AROUND THE BUTLER WHO SAT AT THE TAP OF A HUGE CASK FILLING AND FILLING CURDIE CAST ONE GLANCE AROUND THE PLACE BEFORE COMMENCING HIS ATTACK
BUT THAT MANY MORE GOBLIN FEET HAD TO GO LIMPING BACK OVER THE UNDERGROUND WAYS OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT MORNING PRESENTLY HOWEVER THEY WERE REINFORCED FROM ABOVE BY THE KING AND HIS PARTY WITH THE REDOUBTABLE QUEEN AT THEIR HEAD
THE IMPOSTURY OF POSITION IS PETTY AND ENDS AS IT SHOULD COMMENCE WITH STIRRING STRIFE
WAS ABSOLUTELY REGULATED BY THEIR SOVEREIGN BUT IT WAS BEYOND EVEN HIS POWER TO PREVENT THEM FROM THINKING FREELY AND FROM EXPRESSING WHAT THEY THOUGHT IN PRIVATE CIRCLES WITH THE KEEN AND DELICATE WIT CHARACTERISTIC OF THEIR NATION AND OF THEIR ORDER
CURDIE BURST IN DANCING AND GYRATING AND STAMPING AND SINGING LIKE A SMALL INCARNATE WHIRLWIND
ARRAYED IN AN IRISH POPLIN OF THE DARKEST VISIBLE SHADE OF GREEN WITHOUT EITHER TRAIN OR FLOWER OF DISTINCTION NOT EVEN A SPECK OF RIBBON OR BORDER OF LACE AND NO ORNAMENT ONLY THE VALUED NECKLET WHICH GRACED HER PEARLY THROAT
SOON HOWEVER THE MAGNIFICENT KING CONCEIVED AN INEXPLICABLE DISGUST FOR HIS BIRTHPLACE HE QUITTED SAINT GERMAINS FOR VERSAILLES AND EXPENDED SUMS ALMOST FABULOUS IN THE VAIN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A PARADISE
THE INHABITANTS OF THE HAGUE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM INSULTING ALBEVILLE HIS HOUSE WAS SO CLOSELY BESET BY THE POPULACE DAY AND NIGHT
AND MASTERED THOROUGHLY THE EXPOSURE OF THE PAINFUL AGONY THROUGH WHICH SHE WAS PASSING KNOWING AS SHE DID AND FULLY BELIEVED THAT ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS
THE ELECTIONS WENT ON RAPIDLY AND SMOOTHLY THERE WERE SCARCELY ANY CONTESTS FOR THE NATION HAD DURING MORE THAN A YEAR BEEN KEPT IN CONSTANT EXPECTATION OF A PARLIAMENT WRITS INDEED HAD BEEN TWICE ISSUED AND TWICE RECALLED
AND STILL MORE OUT OF HUMOUR WITH ITS NATURAL CHIEF
WILLIAM TALKED TO THEM WITH A FRANKNESS AND AN EFFUSION OF HEART WHICH SELDOM APPEARED IN HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH ENGLISHMEN HIS FIRST WORDS WERE WELL AND WHAT DO OUR FRIENDS AT HOME SAY NOW IN TRUTH
FOR HE HAD SOON FOUND THEIR HEADS ALL BUT INVULNERABLE THE QUEEN HAD ATTACKED HIS LEGS AND FEET WITH HER HORRIBLE GRANITE SHOE AND HE WAS SOON DOWN BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD GOT HIS BACK TO THE WALL AND STOOD OUT LONGER
WHO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVING TO ALL EUROPE
BUT THE QUEEN STOOD IN FRONT LIKE AN INFURIATED CAT WITH HER PERPENDICULAR EYES GLEAMING GREEN AND HER HAIR STANDING HALF UP FROM HER HORRID HEAD HER HEART WAS QUAKING HOWEVER AND SHE KEPT MOVING ABOUT HER SKIN SHOD FOOT WITH NERVOUS APPREHENSION
WITH AN ALACRITY BETTER IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED AND RUSHING INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE LORD AND LADY DILWORTH EAGERLY AWAITED HER PRESENTED THE OUTWARD MOCKING APPEARANCE OF BEING THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS
THAT SHE DARE NOT TRUST HERSELF TO OFFER HER THE FIRST MOTHERLY EMBRACE IRENE PERCEIVING THE GREAT EMBARRASSMENT OF HER BELOVED LADY DILWORTH GLIDED ACROSS THE ROOM
BETTER LEAVE HER TO THE FREEDOM OF A WILL THAT ERE LONG WOULD SINK THE SHIP OF OPULENCE IN THE SEA OF PENURY AND WRING FROM HER THE WORDS LEAVE ME NOW DECEPTIVE DEMON OF DELUDED MOCKERY
DID LADY DUNFERN EVER DREAM THAT HER APOLOGY FOR DISOBEDIENCE TO LADY DILWORTH'S ORDERS IN NOT ARRAYING HERSELF IN THE GARB OF GLISTENING GLORY COULD EVER BE ACCEPTED EVEN BY THE KIND AND LOVING LADY DILWORTH
BEFORE HIS GORGEOUS COACH WENT THE SWISS HALBERDIERS ON EACH SIDE OF IT AND BEHIND IT RODE THE BODY GUARDS WITH CYMBALS CLASHING AND TRUMPETS PEALING
THE PARTY WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO HIM WAS TRIUMPHANT ENTHUSIASTIC FULL OF LIFE AND ENERGY THE PARTY FROM WHICH ALONE HE COULD EXPECT SERIOUS OPPOSITION WAS DISUNITED AND DISHEARTENED OUT OF HUMOUR WITH ITSELF
WAS DEADLY SO TO OSCAR BUT FUTURE FACTS HAD TO BE SOLVED WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY WOULD BE TREATED WITH MORE COMPARATIVE REVERENCE THAN HERETOFORE BY HIM WHO SUFFERED SEVERELY
CAME THE MOST SPLENDID ARISTOCRACY OF EUROPE ALL FEATHERS RIBANDS JEWELS AND EMBROIDERY BEFORE THE PROCESSION HAD GONE FAR IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT MARY WAS APPROACHING LEWIS ALIGHTED AND ADVANCED ON FOOT TO MEET HER
HE WHO HAD HITHERTO ON ALL QUESTIONS OF PRECEDENCE BEEN SENSITIVE LITIGIOUS INSOLENT WHO HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONCE READY TO PLUNGE EUROPE INTO WAR RATHER THAN CONCEDE THE MOST FRIVOLOUS POINT OF ETIQUETTE
THIS STRANGE APATHY THEY ATTRIBUTED NOT TO PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION BUT TO STUPIDITY AND MEANNESS OF SPIRIT
SUCH TRIFLES WERE SERIOUS MATTERS AT THE OLD COURT OF FRANCE THERE WERE PRECEDENTS ON BOTH SIDES BUT LEWIS DECIDED THE POINT AGAINST HIS OWN BLOOD SOME LADIES OF ILLUSTRIOUS RANK OMITTED THE CEREMONY OF KISSING THE HEM OF MARY'S ROBE
THERE LEAVES A SCAR OF INDELIBLE INTOLERANCE UNTIL WIPED OUT FOR EVER WITH THE CURATIVE BALSAM OF BATTLED FREEDOM SIR JOHN AND IRENE MET IN DILWORTH CASTLE FOR THE LAST TIME ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY OF AUGUST
AND NEVER BETTER EXEMPLIFIED THAN IN THE PRESENT EXISTING STATE OF AFFAIRS
HE FOUND THE BEDCLOTHES TOSSED ABOUT AND MOST OF THEM ON THE FLOOR WHILE THE PRINCESS'S GARMENTS WERE SCATTERED ALL OVER THE ROOM WHICH WAS IN THE GREATEST CONFUSION IT WAS ONLY TOO EVIDENT THAT THE GOBLINS HAD BEEN THERE
FANCYING HE HEARD THE GOBLINS ALL OVER THE HOUSE HE GAVE A GREAT CRY THEN THERE CAME AS HE THOUGHT A HAND UPON THE LOCK OF HIS DOOR IT OPENED AND LOOKING UP HE SAW A LADY WITH WHITE HAIR CARRYING A SILVER BOX IN HER HAND ENTER THE ROOM
ONLY SEVEN DAYS AND THIS BEAUTIFUL BOUDOIR SHALL OWN ME NO MORE WITH ITS WALLS OF PUREST WHITE AND GILDED BORDERS JUST SEVEN DAYS AND I SHALL BE FETTERED WITH CHAINS OF DRAGGING DISLIKE AND DISAPPOINTMENT
SHALL SEEM NO MORE THAN SCROFF IN HIS EYES
ENTER HIS OWN DOOR AT ONE SIDE OF CLYM'S HOUSE WAS A KNOLL AND ON THE TOP OF THE KNOLL A CLUMP OF FIR TREES SO HIGHLY THRUST UP INTO THE SKY THAT THEIR FOLIAGE FROM A DISTANCE APPEARED
SO THAT OTHER GIRLS MAY TAKE WARNING AND KEEP CLEAR OF IT THOMASIN LOWERED HER FACE TO THE APPLES AGAIN I AM A WARNING TO OTHERS JUST AS THIEVES AND DRUNKARDS AND GAMBLERS ARE
AND THEY TELL ME TIS WHERE THE KING'S HEAD WAS CUT OFF YEARS AGO MY POOR MOTHER USED TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT BUSINESS HUMMY SHE USED TO SAY I WAS A YOUNG MAID THEN
SHE TRIED ONE ASCENDING PATH AND ANOTHER AND FOUND THAT THEY LED HER ASTRAY RETRACING HER STEPS SHE CAME AGAIN TO AN OPEN LEVEL WHERE SHE PERCEIVED AT A DISTANCE A MAN AT WORK
YOU MAY THINK WHAT YOU CHOOSE I HAVE NEVER IMPLIED TO YOU BY WORD OR DEED THAT I HAVE GROWN TO THINK OTHERWISE OF HIM AND I NEVER WILL AND I SHALL MARRY HIM WELL WAIT TILL HE REPEATS HIS OFFER
HAD BEEN PASSED IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL THE CENTRE AND VORTEX
STRANGERS DON'T SEE YOU AS I DO SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT THEY JUDGE FROM FALSE REPORT WELL IT IS A SILLY JOB AND I AM PARTLY TO BLAME HOW QUICKLY A RASH THING CAN BE DONE
IT IS THE ONLY WAY OUT OF A FALSE POSITION AND A VERY GALLING ONE WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM THAT HE WAS STANDING IN THE WAY OF ANOTHER LOVER OF YOURS AUNT
SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT QUIETLY FIXING HER EYE UPON HER NIECE
SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM AND INQUIRED THE WAY THE LABOURER POINTED OUT THE DIRECTION AND ADDED
SAID THE CAPTAIN SHORTLY AFTER WHICH HE WALKED AWAY I SAY SAM OBSERVED HUMPHREY WHEN THE OLD MAN WAS GONE
IN A PROFOUND REVERIE HER TOE UNCONSCIOUSLY TAPPING THE DRY TURF WHICH LAY BURNING AT HER FEET
THAN AN INSECT HE APPEARED AS A MERE PARASITE OF THE HEATH
THE FURZE CUTTER WAS SO ABSORBED IN THE BUSINESS OF HIS JOURNEY THAT HE NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD AND HIS LEATHER LEGGED AND GAUNTLETED FORM AT LENGTH BECAME TO HER AS NOTHING MORE THAN A MOVING HANDPOST TO SHOW HER THE WAY
STRANGE THAT SUCH A PIECE OF IDLING SHOULD HAVE SEEMED AN IMPORTANT ERRAND SHE PUT ON HER BONNET AND LEAVING THE HOUSE DESCENDED THE HILL ON THE SIDE TOWARDS BLOOMS END
WHICH HUMPHREY HAD BEEN CUTTING FOR THE CAPTAIN'S USE DURING THE FOREGOING FINE DAYS THE STACK WAS AT THE END OF THE DWELLING AND THE MEN ENGAGED IN BUILDING IT WERE HUMPHREY AND SAM THE OLD MAN LOOKING ON
I BELONG TO ONE MAN NOTHING CAN ALTER THAT
AUNT SHE SAID PRESENTLY I HAVE I THINK A RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION YES YOU HAVE
IS THE VERY THING THAT WILL HINDER THE TALE FROM REACHING HIM EARLY IF I AM NOT MADE SAFE FROM SNEERS IN A WEEK OR TWO I WILL TELL HIM MYSELF THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH THOMASIN SPOKE PREVENTED FURTHER OBJECTIONS
SUDDENLY SHE WAS ATTRACTED TO HIS INDIVIDUALITY BY OBSERVING PECULIARITIES IN HIS WALK IT WAS A GAIT SHE HAD SEEN SOMEWHERE BEFORE AND THE GAIT REVEALED THE MAN TO HER AS THE GAIT OF AHIMAAZ IN THE DISTANT PLAIN
IT WAS NOW NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE SUNLIGHT WAS LEAVING THE VALES WHEN THE WEST GREW RED THE TWO RELATIVES CAME AGAIN FROM THE HOUSE AND PLUNGED INTO THE HEATH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM THE FIRST
IT WAS A FINE AND QUIET AFTERNOON ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK BUT THE WINTER SOLSTICE HAVING STEALTHILY COME ON THE LOWNESS OF THE SUN CAUSED THE HOUR TO SEEM LATER THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS
HOW BEST TO MAKE HER VISIT APPEAR TO EUSTACIA NOT ABJECT BUT WISE FROM HER ELEVATED POSITION THE EXHAUSTED WOMAN COULD PERCEIVE THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE BELOW AND THE GARDEN
AND BY AN INSTINCTIVE IMPULSE OF LOYALTY TOWARDS HER COUSIN CLYM TO BESTIR HERSELF ON HIS ACCOUNT WITH AN ALACRITY UNUSUAL IN HER DURING THESE MOST SORROWFUL DAYS OF HER LIFE
ANY MORE THAN I AM AN IMPROPER WOMAN HE HAS AN UNFORTUNATE MANNER AND DOESN'T TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE HIM IF THEY DON'T WISH TO DO IT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THOMASIN
CLYM'S FAMILY IS AS GOOD AS HERS
AND HELP CARRY ANYTHING FOR'N THOUGH I SUPPOSE HE'S ALTERED FROM THE BOY HE WAS THEY SAY HE CAN TALK FRENCH AS FAST AS A MAID CAN EAT BLACKBERRIES AND IF SO DEPEND UPON IT WE WHO HAVE STAYED AT HOME
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THESE NEW MOVES IN FAMILIES MY FATHER WAS A SAILOR SO WAS I AND SO SHOULD MY SON HAVE BEEN IF I HAD HAD ONE THE PLACE HE'S BEEN LIVING AT IS PARIS SAID HUMPHREY
WHY DON'T PEOPLE JUDGE ME BY MY ACTS NOW LOOK AT ME AS I KNEEL HERE PICKING UP THESE APPLES DO I LOOK LIKE A LOST WOMAN I WISH ALL GOOD WOMEN WERE AS GOOD AS I SHE
YES POOR MAID HER HEART HAS ACHED ENOUGH ABOUT IT HER HEALTH IS SUFFERING FROM IT I HEAR FOR SHE WILL BIDE ENTIRELY INDOORS WE NEVER SEE HER OUT NOW SCAMPERING OVER THE FURZE WITH A FACE AS RED AS A ROSE AS SHE USED TO DO
AN END IS THAT WHICH IS NATURALLY AFTER SOMETHING ITSELF EITHER AS ITS NECESSARY OR USUAL CONSEQUENT AND WITH NOTHING ELSE AFTER IT AND A MIDDLE THAT WHICH IS BY NATURE AFTER ONE THING
D TO THE THIRD C FOR ONE MAY THEN METAPHORICALLY PUT B IN LIEU OF D AND D IN LIEU OF B NOW AND THEN TOO THEY QUALIFY
IT IS TO BE REMEMBERED THAT IN A COMPOUND WE DO NOT THINK OF THE PARTS AS HAVING A SIGNIFICANCE ALSO BY THEMSELVES IN THE NAME THEODORUS FOR INSTANCE THE DORON MEANS NOTHING TO US
AND HAS ALSO ANOTHER AFTER IT A WELL CONSTRUCTED PLOT THEREFORE CANNOT EITHER BEGIN OR END AT ANY POINT ONE LIKES BEGINNING AND END IN IT MUST BE OF THE FORMS JUST DESCRIBED
SHOULD HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH SUCH A MEAN LOW STUPID FELLOW AS SO AND SO WHEN IN THIS HOUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MASTERS GRADUATES AND DIVINITY STUDENTS FROM AMONG WHOM YOU MIGHT CHOOSE AS IF THEY WERE A LOT OF PEARS SAYING THIS ONE I'LL TAKE
AGAIN TO BE BEAUTIFUL A LIVING CREATURE AND EVERY WHOLE MADE UP OF PARTS MUST NOT ONLY PRESENT A CERTAIN ORDER IN ITS ARRANGEMENT OF PARTS BUT ALSO BE OF A CERTAIN DEFINITE MAGNITUDE
WITH ITS SEVERAL INCIDENTS SO CLOSELY CONNECTED THAT THE TRANSPOSAL OR WITHDRAWAL
AND IN THE SECOND MELODY AND DICTION THESE TWO BEING THE MEANS OF THEIR IMITATION HERE BY DICTION I MEAN MERELY THIS THE COMPOSITION OF THE VERSES AND BY MELODY WHAT IS TOO COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD TO REQUIRE EXPLANATION
THE POET'S AIM THEN SHOULD BE TO COMBINE EVERY ELEMENT OF INTEREST IF POSSIBLE OR ELSE THE MORE IMPORTANT AND THE MAJOR PART OF THEM THIS IS NOW ESPECIALLY NECESSARY OWING TO THE UNFAIR CRITICISM TO WHICH THE POET IS SUBJECTED IN THESE DAYS
BEFORE PROCEEDING TO LENGTHEN IT OUT BY THE INSERTION OF EPISODES THE FOLLOWING WILL SHOW HOW THE UNIVERSAL ELEMENT IN IPHIGENIA FOR INSTANCE MAY BE VIEWED A CERTAIN MAIDEN
NOT A FEW OF THE DRAMATISTS HAVE MADE DUE USE AS EVERY PLAY ONE MAY SAY ADMITS OF SPECTACLE CHARACTER FABLE DICTION MELODY AND THOUGHT
IN THIS WAY SEEING EVERYTHING WITH THE VIVIDNESS OF AN EYE WITNESS AS IT WERE HE WILL DEVISE WHAT IS APPROPRIATE AND BE LEAST LIKELY TO OVERLOOK INCONGRUITIES THIS IS SHOWN BY WHAT WAS CENSURED IN
END IN I AND FIVE IN T
BY ATTEMPTING TO DRAMATIZE FOR INSTANCE THE ENTIRE STORY OF THE ILIAD IN THE EPIC OWING TO ITS SCALE EVERY PART IS TREATED AT PROPER LENGTH WITH A DRAMA HOWEVER ON THE SAME STORY THE RESULT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING
SINCE IT IS FROM THESE THAT WE ASCRIBE CERTAIN QUALITIES TO THEIR ACTIONS THERE ARE IN THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS THEREFORE TWO CAUSES CHARACTER AND THOUGHT
A VOWEL IS A LETTER HAVING AN AUDIBLE SOUND WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF ANOTHER LETTER
BEAUTY IS A MATTER OF SIZE AND ORDER AND THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE EITHER ONE IN A VERY MINUTE CREATURE SINCE OUR PERCEPTION BECOMES INDISTINCT AS IT APPROACHES INSTANTANEITY OR TWO
THAT I WON'T TAKE BUT SHE REPLIED TO HIM WITH GREAT SPRIGHTLINESS AND CANDOUR MY DEAR SIR YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN AND YOUR IDEAS ARE VERY OLD FASHIONED IF YOU THINK THAT I HAVE MADE A BAD CHOICE IN SO AND SO
A LENGTH WHICH ALLOWS OF THE HERO PASSING BY A SERIES OF PROBABLE OR NECESSARY STAGES FROM MISFORTUNE TO HAPPINESS OR FROM HAPPINESS TO MISFORTUNE MAY SUFFICE AS A LIMIT FOR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORY
AND BY THE KINDS SEPARATELY I MEAN THAT SOME PORTIONS ARE WORKED OUT WITH VERSE ONLY AND OTHERS IN
THOU MUST KNOW THAT A CERTAIN WIDOW FAIR YOUNG INDEPENDENT AND RICH AND ABOVE ALL FREE AND EASY FELL IN LOVE WITH A STURDY STRAPPING YOUNG LAY BROTHER HIS SUPERIOR CAME TO KNOW OF IT
A CERTAIN MAN HAS BEEN ABROAD MANY YEARS POSEIDON IS EVER ON THE WATCH FOR HIM AND HE IS ALL ALONE MATTERS AT HOME TOO HAVE COME TO THIS THAT HIS SUBSTANCE IS BEING WASTED
HAVE AS MUCH CARE AS OF HIS OWN PERSON HE SET OUT FOR THE PLAIN STREWING AT INTERVALS THE BRANCHES OF BROOM AS HIS MASTER HAD RECOMMENDED HIM AND SO HE WENT HIS WAY THOUGH DON QUIXOTE STILL ENTREATED HIM TO SEE HIM
ALL THAT THEY WILL BE METAPHORICALLY DESCRIBED IN JUST THE SAME WAY THUS TO CAST FORTH SEED
COSTUMIER THAN THE POET
WITH AN A THE VARIOUS FORMS OF THE SYLLABLE ALSO BELONG TO THE THEORY OF METRE THREE A CONJUNCTION IS A
OR OF TWO SIGNIFICANT PARTS IT IS POSSIBLE ALSO TO HAVE TRIPLE QUADRUPLE OR HIGHER COMPOUNDS LIKE MOST OF OUR AMPLIFIED NAMES
THE TURNS GIVEN TO THE LANGUAGE WHEN SPOKEN
THE LIMIT HOWEVER SET BY THE ACTUAL NATURE OF THE THING IS THIS THE LONGER THE STORY CONSISTENTLY WITH ITS BEING COMPREHENSIBLE AS A WHOLE THE FINER IT IS BY REASON OF ITS MAGNITUDE AS A ROUGH GENERAL FORMULA
NEITHER MORE NOR LESS AND I PICTURE HER IN MY IMAGINATION AS I WOULD HAVE HER TO BE AS WELL IN BEAUTY AS IN CONDITION HELEN APPROACHES HER NOT NOR DOES LUCRETIA COME UP TO HER
THAT FROM SPECIES TO GENUS IN TRULY TEN THOUSAND GOOD DEEDS HAS ULYSSES WROUGHT WHERE TEN THOUSAND WHICH IS A PARTICULAR LARGE NUMBER IS PUT IN PLACE OF THE GENERIC A LARGE NUMBER
DOST THOU THEN SEE THE CONSEQUENCE OF ALL THAT WE HAVE SAID NAY WHAT CONSEQUENCE THAT ABSOLUTELY EVERY FORTUNE IS GOOD FORTUNE AND HOW CAN THAT BE SAID I ATTEND SAID SHE SINCE EVERY FORTUNE WELCOME AND UNWELCOME ALIKE HAS FOR ITS OBJECT THE REWARD
EVEN AS IT IS DESTROYED BY THINGS INIMICAL THINGS SOLID LIKE STONES RESIST DISINTEGRATION BY THE CLOSE ADHESION OF THEIR PARTS THINGS FLUID LIKE AIR AND WATER YIELD EASILY TO WHAT DIVIDES THEM
OR TURN FROM VICE AND LAY HOLD ON THE PATH OF VIRTUE I CANNOT DENY IT WHAT OF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH IS GIVEN AS REWARD OF THE GOOD DO THE VULGAR ADJUDGE IT BAD ANYTHING BUT THAT THEY DEEM IT TO BE THE BEST AS INDEED IT IS
FOR THE ONE TO WIN GLORY FOR THE OTHER TO PERFECT HIS WISDOM HENCE INDEED VIRTUE GETS ITS NAME BECAUSE RELYING ON ITS OWN EFFICACY IT YIELDETH NOT TO ADVERSITY AND YE WHO HAVE TAKEN YOUR STAND ON VIRTUE'S STEEP ASCENT
HOLD THE MEAN WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH WHATEVER FALLS SHORT OF THIS OR GOES BEYOND IS FRAUGHT WITH SCORN OF HAPPINESS AND MISSES THE REWARD OF TOIL IT RESTS WITH YOU TO MAKE YOUR FORTUNE WHAT YOU WILL VERILY EVERY HARSH SEEMING FORTUNE UNLESS IT EITHER DISCIPLINES OR AMENDS IS PUNISHMENT
A MAN HUNG UP LIKE A DOG THEN YOU MIGHT SAVE ME FROM THIS IGNOMINIOUS DEATH SAID BIRCH SPRINGING TO HIS FEET AND CATCHING THE DRAGOON BY THE ARM AND OH WHAT WILL I NOT GIVE YOU IN REWARD
HE WILL PUNISH YE ALL FOR IMPOSING ON A DACENT WIDOWED BODY YOU MARAUDER WITH THESE WORDS WHICH ONLY EXTORTED A LAUGH FROM THE SENTINEL BETTY STAGGERED ROUND THE END OF THE BUILDING AND MADE THE BEST OF HER WAY TOWARDS THE QUARTERS
AND FROM THE LION REFT HIS SKIN THE FOUL BIRDS WITH SURE DARTS HE SLEW THE GOLDEN FRUIT HE STOLE IN VAIN THE DRAGON'S WATCH WITH TRIPLE CHAIN FROM HELL'S DEPTHS CERBERUS HE DREW
FOR MANY OF THE LESSER IMPLEMENTS OF HUSBANDRY THE LAWLESS TIMES HAD HOWEVER OCCASIONED ITS BEING STRIPPED OF EVERYTHING OF VALUE AND THE SEARCHING EYES OF BETTY FLANAGAN SELECTED THIS SPOT ON HER ARRIVAL
CAN'T YOU HEAR THE RASCAL SNORING IN MY ROOM YOU DIRTY BLACKGUARD SPUTTERED BETTY HER WHOLE FRAME SHAKING WITH RAGE AND IS IT SO YE WOULD SARVE A
AND I FIND IT A GREAT STRENGTHENER IN TIME OF NEED WHILE SPEAKING HE TOOK A BIBLE FROM HIS POCKET AND OFFERED IT TO THE PEDDLER BIRCH RECEIVED THE VOLUME WITH HABITUAL REVERENCE BUT THERE WAS AN ABSTRACTED AIR ABOUT HIM AND A WANDERING OF THE EYE
OF AN INTELLIGENT SOUL BUT OF THE DRIFT OF NATURE
HIS MEDITATIONS WERE HOWEVER SOON INTERRUPTED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE WASHERWOMAN
WHAT THEN OF THAT WHICH REMAINS WHICH THOUGH IT IS HARSH PUTS THE RESTRAINT OF JUST PUNISHMENT ON THE BAD DOES POPULAR OPINION DEEM IT GOOD
THAT PROCEEDED FROM HER OWN NOSE FOR THE BUGLES OF THE VIRGINIANS SOUNDING THE CHARGE ANOTHER WAS THE PECULIAR OPINIONS THAT THE VETERAN ENTERTAINED OF LIFE AND DEATH AND BY WHICH HE WAS DISTINGUISHED IN THE CORPS
TEN YEARS A TEDIOUS WARFARE RAGED ERE ILIUM'S SMOKING RUINS PAID
THESE HANDS SAID THE PEDDLER STRETCHING FORTH HIS MEAGER BONY FINGERS
I PROMISE YOU ON THE WORD OF AN HONEST DRAGOON TO LEND YOU A HELPING HAND TO SEE THEM RIGHTED
AS IF NO INTERRUPTION HAD OCCURRED THE RELIEF ARRIVED AT THIS MOMENT THE SENTINEL WHO FELT NETTLED AT THE CONTEMPT OF THE PEDDLER AFTER COMMUNICATING HIS ORDERS WHILE HE WAS RETIRING EXCLAIMED TO HIS SUCCESSOR
THAT INDUCED HIS COMPANION TO THINK THAT ALARM WAS GETTING THE MASTERY OF THE PEDDLER'S FEELINGS ACCORDINGLY
UNTIL THE DRAGOON AT HIS DOOR HEARD HIS LOUD BREATHINGS
BUT WE HAVE PROVED THAT ONE IS THE VERY SAME THING AS GOOD WE HAVE ALL THINGS THEN SEEK THE GOOD INDEED YOU MAY EXPRESS THE FACT BY DEFINING GOOD AS THAT WHICH ALL DESIRE
AND A SANCTUARY FOR HER PERSON THE SPARE ARMS AND BAGGAGE OF THE CORPS HAD ALSO BEEN DEPOSITED HERE AND THE UNITED TREASURES WERE PLACED UNDER THE EYE OF THE SENTINEL WHO PARADED THE SHED AS A GUARDIAN OF THE REAR OF THE HEADQUARTERS
THIS IS WE SAY A LIVING CREATURE BUT WHEN THIS UNITY IS BROKEN BY THE SEPARATION OF THESE TWO THE CREATURE DIES AND IS CLEARLY NO LONGER LIVING
WELL LET HER THEN BUT BE CAREFUL THAT THIS WILY PEDDLER DOES NOT GET OUT IN THE FOLDS OF HER PETTICOATS
AND NO DOUBT YOU NOW FEEL IT A GREAT CONSOLATION THERE ARE THREE GREAT SINS THAT IF A MAN CAN KEEP HIS CONSCIENCE CLEAR OF WHY BY THE MERCY OF GOD HE MAY HOPE TO PASS MUSTER WITH THE SAINTS IN HEAVEN
OR TRIAL OF THE GOOD AND THE PUNISHING OR AMENDING OF THE BAD EVERY FORTUNE MUST BE GOOD SINCE IT IS EITHER JUST OR USEFUL THE REASONING IS EXCEEDING TRUE SAID I THE CONCLUSION SO LONG AS I REFLECT UPON THE PROVIDENCE AND FATE OF WHICH THOU HAST TAUGHT ME
THEIR ESSENCE IS ONE AND THE SAME THERE IS NO DENYING IT NOW DOST THOU KNOW SAID SHE THAT ALL WHICH IS ABIDES AND SUBSISTS SO LONG AS IT CONTINUES ONE BUT SO SOON AS IT CEASES TO BE ONE IT PERISHES
I QUITE AGREE SAID I TRULY ALL THY REASONINGS HOLD ADMIRABLY TOGETHER THEN SAID SHE WHAT VALUE WOULDST THOU PUT UPON THE BOON SHOULDST THOU COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ABSOLUTE GOOD OH AN INFINITE SAID I
HAD PRODUCED AN EFFECT ON HIM DIFFERING GREATLY FROM THAT WHICH WAS THE USUAL MORAL CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH SCENES
THOROUGHLY EXAMINED THE PLACE IN WHICH HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT AND SAW NO MEANS OF ESCAPE
BUT DOST NOT THOU ALLOW THAT ALL WHICH IS GOOD IS GOOD BY PARTICIPATION IN GOODNESS IT IS THEN THOU MUST ON SIMILAR GROUNDS ADMIT THAT UNITY AND GOODNESS ARE THE SAME
TO SUFFER ANY FEELINGS OF COMMISERATION TO MINGLE WITH THESE REFLECTIONS OF THE SENTINEL
GENERATION AFTER GENERATION FOR EVER AND DO NOT ALSO THE THINGS BELIEVED INANIMATE ON LIKE GROUNDS OF REASON SEEK EACH WHAT IS PROPER TO ITSELF WHY DO THE FLAMES SHOOT LIGHTLY UPWARD
I HAD SOON DRAWN THE STOPPER OF STRAW INTO THE MOUTH OF THE HOLE WHERE HEARING NO ONE APPROACH I BEGAN TO EAT MY OATCAKE AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN BEFORE I HAD FINISHED
ON AN AXIS AND THE MOON THEREUPON SHOOK HERSELF IN RESPONSE THEN THEY NODDED TO EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT IS ENTIRELY MY OWN OPINION AT LAST THEY BEGAN TO TALK
NAY BY NO MEANS SAID I THEN HAPPINESS MUST CERTAINLY NOT BE SOUGHT IN THESE THINGS WHICH SEVERALLY ARE BELIEVED TO AFFORD SOME ONE OF THE BLESSINGS MOST TO BE DESIRED THEY MUST NOT I ADMIT
I CLIMBED UP ON THE BED I FELT ALL ACROSS IT UTTER DESERTION SEIZED MY SOUL MY FATHER WAS NOT THERE WAS IT A HORRIBLE DREAM SHOULD I EVER AWAKE
SHE STARTS WITH WHAT IS WHOLE AND PERFECT AND FALLS AWAY LATER TO THESE FEEBLE AND INFERIOR PRODUCTIONS SO IF THERE IS AS WE SHOWED BEFORE A HAPPINESS OF A FRAIL AND IMPERFECT KIND
AND FORTHWITH LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND SANG
I THOUGHT I HAD LOST YOU AND I THOUGHT I HAD LOST YOU MY BOY TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT BETWEEN MY NARRATIVE AND MY REPLIES TO HIS QUESTIONINGS HE HAD SOON GATHERED THE WHOLE STORY
DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT FOR IF THOU DEEMEST IT RECEIVED FROM WITHOUT THOU MAYST ESTEEM THAT WHICH GIVES MORE EXCELLENT THAN THAT WHICH HAS RECEIVED
AND HAVING NO FACES YET BUT BEING A SORT OF CELESTIAL TADPOLES INDICATED BY THEIR MOTIONS ALONE THAT THEY TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE QUESTIONS AGITATING THEIR PARENTS SOME OF THEM KEPT DARTING UP AND DOWN THE LADDER OF RAYS
CANNOT BE IDENTICAL THEREFORE THAT WHICH OF ITS OWN NATURE IS DISTINCT FROM THE HIGHEST GOOD IS NOT ITSELF THE HIGHEST GOOD AN IMPIOUS THOUGHT OF HIM THAN WHOM TIS PLAIN NOTHING CAN BE MORE EXCELLENT
TO WHICH THEY GIVE THE NAME DEDUCTIONS SO WILL I ADD HERE A SORT OF COROLLARY FOR SINCE MEN BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF HAPPINESS WHILE HAPPINESS IS VERY GODSHIP
DOES NOT EVEN LAY HOLD OF THAT ONE WHICH HE MAKES HIS AIM WELL SAID I WHAT THEN SUPPOSE ANYONE DESIRE TO OBTAIN THEM TOGETHER
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT SAID I BUT I AM IMPATIENT TO HEAR WHAT REMAINS WHY IT IS MANIFEST THAT ALL THE OTHERS ARE RELATIVE TO THE GOOD
I SEEM TO HAVE SOME INKLING BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE AT LARGE FROM THEE WHY TRULY THE REASON IS HARD AT HAND
THE WARM TIDE OF COURAGE BEGAN AGAIN TO FLOW FROM MY HEART I OPENED THIS DOOR TOO VERY QUIETLY FOR WAS NOT THE DRAGON ASLEEP DOWN BELOW PAPA PAPA I CRIED IN AN EAGER WHISPER
NOT AS MEN CONVERSE BUT BOTH AT ONCE YET EACH LISTENING WHILE EACH SPOKE I HEARD NO WORD BUT THEIR LIPS MOVED MOST BUSILY THEIR EYEBROWS WENT UP
IS ONE AND THE SAME I CANNOT SEE HOW ANYONE CAN DISSENT FROM THESE CONCLUSIONS
I TUMBLED AT ONE OF THE DOORS RATHER THAN RAN TO IT I FOUND IT FAST
SINCE NOW THOU HAST SEEN WHAT IS THE FORM OF THE IMPERFECT GOOD AND WHAT THE FORM OF THE PERFECT ALSO
SO IT COMES TO PASS THAT WHENEVER IMPERFECTION IS FOUND IN ANY PARTICULAR THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE A PERFECTION IN RESPECT OF THAT PARTICULAR ALSO FOR WERE THERE NO SUCH PERFECTION
THIS CLEFT IN TWAIN AND IN TWO CIRCLES GATHERED SPEEDS IN A PATH THAT ON ITSELF RETURNS ENCOMPASSING MIND'S LIMITS AND CONFORMS THE HEAVENS TO HER TRUE SEMBLANCE
AND DOWN THEIR EYELIDS WINKED AND WINKED AND THEIR CHEEKS PUCKERED AND RELAXED INCESSANTLY THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE STORM OF EXPRESSION UPON THEIR FACES THEIR VERY NOSES TWISTED AND CURLED
I CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND ME AND ALMOST SICK WITH THE MISERY OF A BEING WHERE NO OTHER BEING WAS TO COMFORT IT I GROPED MY WAY TO MY FATHER'S ROOM WHEN I ONCE HAD MY HAND ON HIS DOOR
THE AWFUL VAULT OF HEAVEN OVER MY HEAD AND THOSE SHADOWY RICKS AROUND ME IT WAS A RELIEF TO LAY MY HAND ON ONE OF THEM AND FEEL THAT IT WAS SOLID I HALF GROPED MY WAY THROUGH THEM
AND GOT OUT INTO THE OPEN FIELD
AND THE UNIVERSE CONTROLS
THEY CANNOT IN ANY WISE BE DISPUTED BUT COME SEE HOW STRICTLY AND INCONTROVERTIBLY THOU MAYST PROVE THIS OUR ASSERTION
NOT THE TAGUS PRECIOUS SANDS
HOW ANY SADNESS CAN FIND ENTRANCE INTO SUCH A STATE WHEREFORE I MUST NEEDS ACKNOWLEDGE IT FULL OF JOY AT LEAST IF OUR FORMER CONCLUSIONS ARE TO HOLD THEN FOR THE SAME REASONS
EVEN TO GO OUT AT THE OPPOSITE DOOR I FORGOT HOW SOUNDLY AND PEACEFULLY I HAD SLEPT IN IT I STEPPED OUT INTO THE NIGHT WITH THE GRASS OF THE CORN YARD UNDER MY FEET
AND SO COMES TO APPEAR SOMEWHAT POOR IN ESTEEM I CANNOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEING WHAT IT IS THIS UNION OF QUALITIES IS ALSO RIGHT FAMOUS IT FOLLOWS THEN
EVEN THINGS WHICH BY NATURE ARE NOT GOOD ARE DESIRED AS IF THEY WERE TRULY GOOD IF THEY SEEM TO BE SO
TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THE PRACTICE OF JUDGING AND CONDEMNING MORALLY IS THE FAVOURITE REVENGE OF THE INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW ON THOSE WHO ARE LESS SO
OUR STUPIDITY EVERY VIRTUE INCLINES TO STUPIDITY EVERY STUPIDITY TO VIRTUE STUPID TO THE POINT OF SANCTITY THEY SAY IN RUSSIA LET US BE CAREFUL LEST
IS PRECISELY THE PERFECTION AND ULTIMATE MATURITY IN EVERY CULTURE AND ART THE ESSENTIALLY NOBLE IN WORKS AND MEN THEIR MOMENT OF SMOOTH SEA AND HALCYON SELF SUFFICIENCY
MORAL SERMONS AND GOODY GOODNESS WON'T CHIME
FOR INSTANCE IF A MAN IS DIGGING THE EARTH FOR TILLAGE AND FINDS A MASS OF BURIED GOLD NOW SUCH A FIND IS REGARDED AS ACCIDENTAL YET IT IS NOT
FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
HISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FOREIGN IS TESTED PUT ON TAKEN OFF PACKED UP AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED
I MEAN AFTER COMFORT AND FASHION
THE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMES
IS OPPOSED TO OUR TASTE NOWADAYS THIS IS ALSO AN ADVANCE AS IT WAS AN ADVANCE IN OUR FATHERS THAT RELIGION AS AN ATTITUDE FINALLY BECAME OPPOSED TO THEIR TASTE INCLUDING THE ENMITY
DID HE PERHAPS DESERVE TO BE LAUGHED AT WHEN HE THUS EXHORTED SYSTEMS OF MORALS TO PRACTISE MORALITY BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH IN THE RIGHT
OR THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER NO THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND WILL BE BEST SERVED THEREBY THEY WOULD LIKE BY ALL MEANS TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING AFTER ENGLISH HAPPINESS
AND TO EVERY FORM OF SEMI BARBARITY THAT HAS AT ANY TIME EXISTED ON EARTH AND IN SO FAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS JUST BEEN SEMI BARBARITY
THE CASE IS NOT DIFFERENT WITH SHAKESPEARE THAT MARVELOUS SPANISH MOORISH SAXON SYNTHESIS OF TASTE OVER WHOM AN ANCIENT ATHENIAN
FOR THEY GET THE BETTER EVEN OF THEIR BLUNDERS
BY MEANS OF OUR SEMI BARBARITY IN BODY AND IN DESIRE WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS EVERYWHERE SUCH AS A NOBLE AGE NEVER HAD WE HAVE ACCESS ABOVE ALL TO THE LABYRINTH OF IMPERFECT CIVILIZATIONS
HONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVE
IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
OR FLORENTINE OR BAROCCO OR NATIONAL IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS IT DOES NOT CLOTHE US BUT THE SPIRIT ESPECIALLY THE
THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
NOT FROM ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE DISCOVERER SINCE NEITHER HE WHO BURIED THE GOLD NOR HE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD INTENDED THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE FOUND BUT AS I SAID IT HAPPENED
THE TENSION OF SOUL IN MISFORTUNE WHICH COMMUNICATES TO IT ITS ENERGY ITS SHUDDERING IN VIEW OF RACK AND RUIN ITS INVENTIVENESS AND BRAVERY IN UNDERGOING ENDURING
TO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLE
THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF WHICH ARE ALREADY SPECIFIED DOCUMENTARILY IN A THOUGHTFUL LETTER OF GALIANI TO MADAME D'EPINAY IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF THE MAN OF MODERN IDEAS
IN WHICH WE HAVE TO FEAR AND LOVE THIS ALMOST INVISIBLE INAUDIBLE WORLD OF DELICATE COMMAND AND DELICATE OBEDIENCE A WORLD OF ALMOST IN EVERY RESPECT CAPTIOUS INSIDIOUS SHARP
BUT THE MEETING AND CONCURRENCE OF THESE CAUSES ARISES FROM THAT INEVITABLE CHAIN OF ORDER WHICH FLOWING FROM THE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF PROVIDENCE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IN THEIR DUE TIME AND PLACE
CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATOR
WITH OUR MOST ARDENT REQUIREMENTS WELL THEN LET US LOOK FOR THEM IN OUR LABYRINTHS WHERE AS WE KNOW SO MANY THINGS LOSE THEMSELVES SO MANY THINGS GET QUITE LOST
A DISSATISFACTION WITH ITS OWN CONDITION OR AN ADMIRATION OF WHAT IS STRANGE ALL THIS DETERMINES AND DISPOSES THEM UNFAVOURABLY EVEN TOWARDS THE BEST THINGS OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE NOT THEIR PROPERTY
THE FORM OF THE MONSTER ON WHOM I HAD BESTOWED EXISTENCE WAS FOREVER BEFORE MY EYES AND I RAVED INCESSANTLY CONCERNING HIM DOUBTLESS MY WORDS SURPRISED HENRY
DO NOT ASK ME CRIED I PUTTING MY HANDS BEFORE MY EYES FOR I THOUGHT I SAW THE DREADED SPECTRE GLIDE INTO THE ROOM HE CAN TELL OH SAVE ME SAVE ME
A MUMMY AGAIN ENDUED WITH ANIMATION COULD NOT BE SO HIDEOUS AS THAT WRETCH I HAD GAZED ON HIM WHILE UNFINISHED HE WAS UGLY THEN BUT WHEN THOSE MUSCLES AND JOINTS WERE RENDERED CAPABLE OF MOTION
HOW FORTUNATE THAT YOU SHOULD BE HERE AT THE VERY MOMENT OF MY ALIGHTING NOTHING COULD EQUAL MY DELIGHT ON SEEING CLERVAL HIS PRESENCE BROUGHT BACK TO MY THOUGHTS MY FATHER ELIZABETH
HIS HAIR WAS OF A LUSTROUS BLACK AND FLOWING HIS TEETH OF A PEARLY WHITENESS BUT THESE LUXURIANCES ONLY FORMED A MORE HORRID CONTRAST WITH HIS WATERY EYES
ROUND WENT THE WHEEL AGAIN TO THE OLD SONG AND THE MANIKIN ONCE MORE SPUN THE HEAP INTO GOLD THE KING CAME IN THE MORNING AND FINDING ALL HE WANTED WAS FORCED TO KEEP HIS WORD
IN THE COURSE OF LONG ISLAND RIDES WITH A SLOW RETURN IN THE GLOWING TWILIGHT ON THE DEEP VERANDA LATE IN THE EVENING LORD LAMBETH WHO HAD STAYED AT MANY HOUSES
BUT I HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS A REASONABLE YOUNG MAN AND I CAN GIVE NO BETTER PROOF OF IT THAN THE FACT THAT HE REMARKED TO HIS COMPANION AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT AFTER ALL I AM VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HER
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INFUSING LIFE INTO AN INANIMATE BODY FOR THIS I HAD DEPRIVED MYSELF OF REST AND HEALTH I HAD DESIRED IT WITH AN ARDOUR THAT FAR EXCEEDED MODERATION
ONLY TO BE FAIR HE ADDED YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD MY MOTHER ALSO THAT SHE IS NOT SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN ME PERCY BEAUMONT GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH THERE IS NOTHING SO CHARMING AS MODESTY IN A YOUNG MAN IN YOUR POSITION
AND WHAT ARE THEY CALLED ONE OF THEM IS MARRIED SHE IS THE COUNTESS OF PIMLICO AND THE OTHER THE OTHER IS UNMARRIED SHE IS PLAIN LADY JULIA
HIS LIMBS WERE IN PROPORTION AND I HAD SELECTED HIS FEATURES AS BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL GREAT GOD HIS YELLOW SKIN SCARCELY COVERED THE WORK OF MUSCLES AND ARTERIES BENEATH
I PERCEIVED THAT THE FALLEN LEAVES HAD DISAPPEARED AND THAT THE YOUNG BUDS WERE SHOOTING FORTH FROM THE TREES THAT SHADED MY WINDOW IT WAS A DIVINE SPRING AND THE SEASON CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO MY CONVALESCENCE
ENTERTAINED BY EVERYBODY INTIMATE WITH EVERYBODY AT THE END OF THREE DAYS THEY HAD REMOVED THEIR LUGGAGE FROM THE HOTEL AND HAD GONE TO STAY WITH MISSUS WESTGATE
OF UNIVERSAL FRIENDLINESS AND FRANKNESS OF OCCASIONS ON WHICH THEY KNEW EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING AND HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF EASE
THEN HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY OFF WHILE THE NURSE LAUGHED AND THE BABY CROWED AND ALL THE COURT JEERED AT HIM FOR HAVING HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE FOR NOTHING AND SAID
LISTENING ATTENTIVELY CATCHING AND FEARING EACH SOUND AS IF IT WERE TO ANNOUNCE THE APPROACH OF THE DEMONIACAL CORPSE TO WHICH I HAD SO MISERABLY GIVEN LIFE OH NO MORTAL COULD SUPPORT THE HORROR OF THAT COUNTENANCE
YOU PREFER A BLUESTOCKING IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL MISS ALDEN HER SISTER TELLS ME SAID PERCY BEAUMONT THAT SHE IS TREMENDOUSLY LITERARY I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
BESSIE ALDEN APPEARED TO BE LOOKING AT HIM WITH INTEREST HE IS THE SON OF THE DUKE OF BAYSWATER HE ADDED PRESENTLY THE ELDEST SON THE ONLY SON
THE CHAMBER DOOR WAS LOCKED AND SHE WAS LEFT ALONE SHE SAT DOWN IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO BEWAIL HER HARD FATE WHEN ON A SUDDEN THE DOOR OPENED AND A DROLL LOOKING LITTLE MAN HOBBLED IN AND SAID
AND HE DISCOVERED FOR HIMSELF THAT THE YOUNG LADY WAS CLEVER AND APPEARED TO HAVE READ A GREAT DEAL SHE SEEMED VERY NICE THOUGH HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT AS MISSUS WESTGATE HAD SAID SHE WAS SHY
BUT HE WAS ABSENT ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS DURING WHICH WITH MISTER WESTGATE'S ASSISTANCE HE COMPLETELY SETTLED THIS PIECE OF BUSINESS THEY CERTAINLY DO THINGS QUICKLY IN NEW YORK HE OBSERVED TO HIS COUSIN
AND A CONVULSIVE MOTION AGITATED ITS LIMBS HOW CAN I DESCRIBE MY EMOTIONS AT THIS CATASTROPHE OR HOW DELINEATE THE WRETCH WHOM WITH SUCH INFINITE PAINS AND CARE I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO FORM
BUT I REMAINED SOME MINUTES WITH MY EYES FIXED ON A COACH THAT WAS COMING TOWARDS ME FROM THE OTHER END OF THE STREET AS IT DREW NEARER I OBSERVED THAT IT WAS THE SWISS DILIGENCE
WE ASCENDED INTO MY ROOM AND THE SERVANT PRESENTLY BROUGHT BREAKFAST BUT I WAS UNABLE TO CONTAIN MYSELF IT WAS NOT JOY ONLY THAT POSSESSED ME
PERCY BEAUMONT RETURNED WITH HIS COUSIN AND HIS SENSE OF DUTY COMPELLED HIM ONE WINDLESS AFTERNOON IN MID ATLANTIC
I BELIEVE I LEFT HIM INCREDULOUS TO THE LAST FOR HIS CONSTANT ANSWER TO MY UNWEARIED ENTREATIES WAS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE DUTCH SCHOOLMASTER IN THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD I HAVE TEN THOUSAND FLORINS A YEAR WITHOUT GREEK
AND HE MUTTERED SOME INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHILE A GRIN WRINKLED HIS CHEEKS HE MIGHT HAVE SPOKEN BUT I DID NOT HEAR ONE HAND WAS STRETCHED OUT SEEMINGLY TO DETAIN ME
WHENEVER THESE TALES ARE HEARD OF THE FEASIBLE DOG OR THE GUFFER BIRD THEN LAUGH AND LAUGH TILL THE FAT TEARS ROLL TO THE ROOTS OF THE JOY BUSH DEEP IN YOUR SOUL WHEN YOU SEE THEM SQUAT ON THE TREE TOPS HIGH SCANNING FOR EVER THAT HEEDLESS SKY
AND KNOW WHAT THEY PROFIT WHO TRADE WITH HATE SAID HE WHENEVER THE GREAT SKIES SPREAD IN THE BECKONING VASTNESS OVERHEAD A TENT FOR THE BLUE WREN BUILDING A NEST THEN DOWN IN THE HEART OF YOU LEARN WHAT'S BEST
HE UNFOLDED THE PAPER AS HE SPOKE AND ADDED IT ISN'T A LETTER AFTER ALL IT'S A SET OF VERSES ARE THEY IN THE PRISONER'S HANDWRITING ASKED ANOTHER OF THE JURYMEN NO THEY'RE NOT SAID THE WHITE RABBIT
SHOUTS OF ANGER AND WORDS OF SHAME AS GLUG BLAMED GLUG FOR HIS WOEFUL STATE THIS BLAME SAID SYM IS IT MORTAL'S RIGHT TO BLAME HIS FELLOW FOR AUGHT HE BE
LET'S STAY ON THE GROUND AND KILL KING SPLOSH BUT SPLOSH THE KING
OR OUR INDUSTRIES SOON WILL BE GONE TO THE DOGS AND THE KING SAID BOSH YOU'RE UN GLUGGISH AND RUDE AND THE QUEEN SAID WHAT AN ABSURD ATTITUDE THEN THE GLUGS CRIED DOWN WITH POLITICAL QUACKS HOW DID OUR GRANDPAS LOOK AT A TAX SO THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE
WHEN THE GREEN MOSS COVERS THOSE STONES YOU TREAD WHEN THE GREEN GRASS WHISPERS ABOVE MY HEAD MARK WELL WHEREVER YOUR PATH MAY TURN THEY HAVE REACHED THE VALLEY OF PEACE WHO LEARN THAT WISE HEARTS CHERISH WHAT FOOLS MAY SPURN
AS SOON AS THE JURY HAD A LITTLE RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK OF BEING UPSET AND THEIR SLATES AND PENCILS HAD BEEN FOUND AND HANDED BACK TO THEM THEY SET TO WORK VERY DILIGENTLY TO WRITE OUT A HISTORY OF THE ACCIDENT ALL EXCEPT THE LIZARD
SO ALICE GOT UP AND RAN OFF THINKING WHILE SHE RAN AS WELL SHE MIGHT WHAT A WONDERFUL DREAM IT HAD BEEN BUT HER SISTER SAT STILL JUST AS SHE LEFT HER LEANING HER HEAD ON HER HAND
WHO SEEMED TOO MUCH OVERCOME TO DO ANYTHING BUT SIT WITH ITS MOUTH OPEN GAZING UP INTO THE ROOF OF THE COURT
WHY IT WAS SCREAMINGLY LAUGHABLE SEEMINGLY ASKING FOR NOTHING BUT STONES AND THE KING SAID HAW AND THE QUEEN SAID OH OUR DRAWING ROOM NOW IS A HEAVENLY SHOW OF LARGE OVERMANTELS AND WHATNOTS AND CHAIRS
ALICE COULD SEE THIS AS SHE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO LOOK OVER THEIR SLATES BUT
FOR THEY FEAR TO TEAR THE VERY EXPENSIVE CLOTHES THEY WEAR BUT JOI WAS A GLUG WITH A TWISTED MIND OF THE NASTY MEDITATIVE KIND
THIS CLIMBING HABIT WAS OLD SO OLD THAT EVEN THE CHEESES COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHEN THE PAST GLUG PEOPLE FIRST BEGAN TO GIVE THEIR LIVES TO THE CLIMBING PLAN AND THE LEGEND RAN THAT THE ART WAS OLD AS THE MIND OF MAN AND EVEN THE MOUNTAINS OLD AND HOAR
I SEEM TO SEE SOME MEANING IN THEM AFTER ALL
SAID HE IF THE MIND OF A GLUG COULD WAKE THEN OH WHAT A WONDERFUL GLUG HE'D MAKE WE SHALL TEACH THIS LADDIE TO PLAY LIFE'S GAME WITH A DIFFERENT MIND AND A DEFINITE AIM A GLUG IN APPEARANCE YET NOT THE SAME
NOR YET DID THE GLUGS IN THEIR DREAMIEST DREAMS
UNLESS IT WAS WRITTEN TO NOBODY WHICH ISN'T USUAL YOU KNOW WHO IS IT DIRECTED TO SAID ONE OF THE JURYMEN IT ISN'T DIRECTED AT ALL SAID THE WHITE RABBIT IN FACT THERE'S NOTHING WRITTEN ON THE OUTSIDE
IF ANY ONE OF THEM CAN EXPLAIN IT SAID ALICE
HE KNOWS THE GLUGS QUITE WELL BY SIGHT YOU CAN NEVER MISTAKE THEM HE WILL SAY FOR THEY ALWAYS ACT IN A GLUGLIKE WAY AND THEY CLIMB THE TREES WHEN THE GLASS POINTS FAIR WITH CIRCUMSPECTION AND PROPER CARE
THERE'S NO NAME SIGNED AT THE END IF YOU DIDN'T SIGN IT SAID THE KING THAT ONLY MAKES THE MATTER WORSE YOU MUST HAVE MEANT SOME MISCHIEF
IF THERE'S NO MEANING IN IT SAID THE KING THAT SAVES A WORLD OF TROUBLE YOU KNOW AS WE NEEDN'T TRY TO FIND ANY AND YET I DON'T KNOW HE WENT ON SPREADING OUT THE VERSES ON HIS KNEE
RODS POLES OR PERCHES DERIVED FROM GREEK OH THE HAWTHORN BUDS CAME OUT THIS WEEK AND ROBINS ARE NESTING DOWN BY THE CREEK SO SYM WAS HEAD OF HIS CLASS NOT ONCE AND HIS AUNT REPEATEDLY DUBBED HIM DUNCE BUT
SO THE GLUGS CONTINUED WITH GREED AND GLEE TO BUY CHEAP CLOTHING AND PILLS AND TEA TILL EVERY GLUG IN THE LAND OF GOSH OWNED THREE CLEAN SHIRTS AND A FOURTH IN THE WASH BUT THEY ALL GREW IDLE AND FOND OF EASE AND EASY TO SWINDLE AND HARD TO PLEASE
SAID ALICE THE KING TURNED PALE AND SHUT HIS NOTE BOOK HASTILY CONSIDER YOUR VERDICT HE SAID TO THE JURY IN A LOW TREMBLING VOICE THERE'S MORE EVIDENCE TO COME YET PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE WHITE RABBIT JUMPING UP IN A GREAT HURRY
NOBODY MOVED WHO CARES FOR YOU SAID ALICE SHE HAD GROWN TO HER FULL SIZE BY THIS TIME YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A PACK OF CARDS AT THIS THE WHOLE PACK ROSE UP INTO THE AIR AND CAME FLYING DOWN UPON HER SHE GAVE A LITTLE SCREAM
PARENTAL BLITHER SHE SAID QUITE FLAT HE'S AN AVERAGE GLUG AND HE'S RED AND FAT AND EXCEEDINGLY FAT AND RED AT THAT BUT THE FATHER JOI WHEN HE GAZED ON SYM DREAMED GREAT AND WONDERFUL THINGS FOR HIM
HER SISTER KISSED HER AND SAID IT WAS A CURIOUS DREAM DEAR CERTAINLY
DO WE BLAME THE NIGHT WHEN DARKNESS GATHERS AND NONE CAN SEE SAID HE WHENEVER THERE SPRINGS FROM EARTH A PLANT ALL CROOKED AND MARRED AT BIRTH SHALL WE UNLEARNED IN THE GARDENER'S SCHEME BLAME PLANT OR EARTH FOR THE FAULTS THAT SEEM
AND ALL WOULD CHANGE TO DULL REALITY THE GRASS WOULD BE ONLY RUSTLING IN THE WIND AND THE POOL RIPPLING TO THE WAVING OF THE REEDS THE RATTLING TEACUPS WOULD CHANGE TO TINKLING SHEEP BELLS AND THE QUEEN'S SHRILL CRIES TO THE VOICE OF THE SHEPHERD BOY
BUT ALL OF THE TALE THAT IS SO FAR TOLD HAS NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH THE OGS OF PODGE AND THEIR CRAFTY DODGE AND THE TRADE IN PICKLES AND GLUE TO TRADE WITH THE GLUGS CAME THE OGS TO GOSH AND THEY SAID IN SEDUCTIVE TONES
SAID HE WHENEVER THE WEST WIND STIRS AND BIRDS IN FEATHERS AND BEASTS IN FURS STEAL OUT TO DANCE IN THE GLADE LIE STILL
AND THERE CAME TO SYM AS HE WALKED AFIELD DEEP THOUGHTS OF THE WORLD AND THE FOLK OF GOSH
WAS RATHER TALL HAD A PLEASING COUNTENANCE A VERY INTELLIGENT AND LIVELY EYE AND IF NOT QUITE HANDSOME WAS VERY NEAR IT HIS ADDRESS WAS GOOD
EXCELLENCE IS PRETTY FAIRLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE SEXES THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY MISSUS ALLEN
IF YOU PLEASE I DANCED WITH A VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN INTRODUCED BY MISTER KING HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONVERSATION WITH HIM SEEMS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY GENIUS
EVERY MORNING NOW BROUGHT ITS REGULAR DUTIES SHOPS WERE TO BE VISITED SOME NEW PART OF THE TOWN TO BE LOOKED AT AND THE PUMP ROOM TO BE ATTENDED WHERE THEY PARADED UP AND DOWN FOR AN HOUR
OR A CAP OR A CLOAK MUSLIN CAN NEVER BE SAID TO BE WASTED I HAVE HEARD MY SISTER SAY SO FORTY TIMES WHEN SHE HAS BEEN EXTRAVAGANT IN BUYING MORE THAN SHE WANTED OR CARELESS IN CUTTING IT TO PIECES
A TOTAL INATTENTION TO STOPS AND A VERY FREQUENT IGNORANCE OF GRAMMAR UPON MY WORD I NEED NOT HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF DISCLAIMING THE COMPLIMENT YOU DO NOT THINK TOO HIGHLY OF US IN THAT WAY
AND SHE REPEATED IT AFTER EVERY FRESH PROOF WHICH EVERY MORNING BROUGHT OF HER KNOWING NOBODY AT ALL THEY MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE LOWER ROOMS AND HERE FORTUNE WAS MORE FAVOURABLE TO OUR HEROINE
NOT KEEP A JOURNAL HOW ARE YOUR ABSENT COUSINS TO UNDERSTAND THE TENOUR OF YOUR LIFE IN BATH WITHOUT ONE HOW ARE THE CIVILITIES AND COMPLIMENTS
BUT WAS STRANGELY HARASSED BY A QUEER HALF WITTED MAN WHO WOULD MAKE ME DANCE WITH HIM AND DISTRESSED ME BY HIS NONSENSE INDEED I SHALL SAY NO SUCH THING
YES I LIKE IT VERY WELL NOW I MUST GIVE ONE SMIRK AND THEN WE MAY BE RATIONAL AGAIN CATHERINE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD NOT KNOWING WHETHER SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO LAUGH
SAID HE AS THEY WALKED BACK TO THE BALLROOM NOT OF YOUR PARTNER I HOPE FOR BY THAT SHAKE OF THE HEAD YOUR MEDITATIONS ARE NOT SATISFACTORY CATHERINE COLOURED AND SAID
AFTER CHATTING SOME TIME ON SUCH MATTERS AS NATURALLY AROSE FROM THE OBJECTS AROUND THEM HE SUDDENLY ADDRESSED HER WITH I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN VERY REMISS MADAM
I SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF ME SAID HE GRAVELY I SHALL MAKE BUT A POOR FIGURE IN YOUR JOURNAL TOMORROW MY JOURNAL YES I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL SAY
EVERYBODY ALLOWS THAT THE TALENT OF WRITING AGREEABLE LETTERS IS PECULIARLY FEMALE NATURE MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING BUT I AM SURE IT MUST BE ESSENTIALLY ASSISTED BY THE PRACTICE OF KEEPING A JOURNAL
ABOUT A WEEK SIR REPLIED CATHERINE TRYING NOT TO LAUGH REALLY WITH AFFECTED ASTONISHMENT WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED SIR
I AM AFRAID IT HAS TORN A HOLE ALREADY I SHALL BE QUITE SORRY IF IT HAS FOR THIS IS A FAVOURITE GOWN THOUGH IT COST BUT NINE SHILLINGS A YARD THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED IT MADAM
IN THE PROPER ATTENTIONS OF A PARTNER HERE I HAVE NOT YET ASKED YOU HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN IN BATH WHETHER YOU WERE EVER HERE BEFORE WHETHER YOU HAVE BEEN AT THE UPPER ROOMS THE THEATRE AND THE CONCERT
CATHERINE FEARED AS SHE LISTENED TO THEIR DISCOURSE THAT HE INDULGED HIMSELF A LITTLE TOO MUCH WITH THE FOIBLES OF OTHERS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF SO EARNESTLY
SAID CATHERINE DOUBTINGLY WHETHER LADIES DO WRITE SO MUCH BETTER LETTERS THAN GENTLEMEN THAT IS I SHOULD NOT THINK THE SUPERIORITY WAS ALWAYS ON OUR SIDE
YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF THAT TROUBLE SIR NO TROUBLE I ASSURE YOU MADAM THEN FORMING HIS FEATURES INTO A SET SMILE AND AFFECTEDLY SOFTENING HIS VOICE HE ADDED WITH A SIMPERING AIR
OF EVERY DAY TO BE RELATED AS THEY OUGHT TO BE UNLESS NOTED DOWN EVERY EVENING IN A JOURNAL HOW ARE YOUR VARIOUS DRESSES TO BE REMEMBERED AND THE PARTICULAR STATE OF YOUR COMPLEXION
NOW HERE ONE CAN STEP OUT OF DOORS AND GET A THING IN FIVE MINUTES MISTER TILNEY WAS POLITE ENOUGH TO SEEM INTERESTED IN WHAT SHE SAID AND SHE KEPT HIM ON THE SUBJECT OF MUSLINS TILL THE DANCING RECOMMENCED
AND CATHERINE FELT HERSELF IN HIGH LUCK THERE WAS LITTLE LEISURE FOR SPEAKING WHILE THEY DANCED BUT WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TEA SHE FOUND HIM AS AGREEABLE AS SHE HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIM CREDIT FOR BEING
BATH IS A CHARMING PLACE SIR THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD SHOPS HERE WE ARE SADLY OFF IN THE COUNTRY NOT BUT WHAT WE HAVE VERY GOOD SHOPS IN SALISBURY
AND CURL OF YOUR HAIR TO BE DESCRIBED IN ALL THEIR DIVERSITIES WITHOUT HAVING CONSTANT RECOURSE TO A JOURNAL MY DEAR MADAM I AM NOT SO IGNORANT OF YOUNG LADIES WAYS AS YOU WISH TO BELIEVE ME
REPLIED MISSUS ALLEN AND SO I TOLD MISS MORLAND WHEN SHE BOUGHT IT BUT THEN YOU KNOW MADAM MUSLIN ALWAYS TURNS TO SOME ACCOUNT OR OTHER MISS MORLAND WILL GET ENOUGH OUT OF IT FOR A HANDKERCHIEF
PRECIPICES LIKE LOW WALLS LAKES REDUCED TO PONDS RIVERS ABBREVIATED INTO STREAMS ON MY RIGHT WERE NUMBERLESS GLACIERS AND INNUMERABLE PEAKS SOME PLUMED WITH FEATHERY CLOUDS OF SMOKE
I RAISED MY HEAD AND SAW FOR THE LAST TIME THROUGH THE LENGTH OF THAT VAST TUBE THE SKY OF ICELAND WHICH I WAS NEVER TO BEHOLD AGAIN THE LAVA IN THE LAST ERUPTION OF TWELVE TWENTY NINE HAD FORCED A PASSAGE THROUGH THIS TUNNEL
THE SHADOW PROJECTED FROM WHICH ON A CERTAIN DAY WOULD POINT OUT THE ROAD TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH NOW NO SUN NO SHADOW AND THEREFORE NO GUIDE HERE WAS JUNE TWENTY FIFTH
ARE CARRIED EVEN INTO ICELAND
I ROSE FROM MY GRANITE BED AND WENT OUT TO ENJOY THE MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE THAT LAY UNROLLED BEFORE ME I STOOD ON THE VERY SUMMIT OF THE SOUTHERNMOST OF SNAEFELL'S PEAKS THE RANGE OF THE EYE EXTENDED OVER THE WHOLE ISLAND
AND SO IT WAS THE BUNDLE HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY A PROJECTION A HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US IMMEDIATELY THE ICELANDER CLIMBED UP LIKE A CAT AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE PACKAGE WAS IN OUR POSSESSION NOW SAID MY UNCLE LET US BREAKFAST
IT WAS A BRIGHT MORNING IN THE EARLY PART OF SUMMER THE RIVER HAD RESUMED ITS WONTED BANKS AND ITS ACCUSTOMED PACE AND A HOT SUN SEEMED TO BE PULLING EVERYTHING GREEN AND BUSHY AND SPIKY UP OUT OF THE EARTH TOWARDS HIM AS IF BY STRINGS
DO CALCULATE MY BOY NOTHING IS EASIER SAID I PUTTING DOWN FIGURES IN MY NOTE BOOK NINE TIMES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET GIVES A DEPTH OF ELEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET VERY ACCURATE INDEED WELL
THIS GAVE REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT OUR DESCENT WAS MORE HORIZONTAL THAN VERTICAL AS FOR THE EXACT DEPTH REACHED IT WAS VERY EASY TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE PROFESSOR MEASURED ACCURATELY THE ANGLES OF DEVIATION AND INCLINATION ON THE ROAD BUT HE KEPT THE RESULTS TO HIMSELF
SUCH PERFECT DISREGARD OF ANY POSSIBLE DANGER THAT I BLUSHED AT THE IDEA OF BEING LESS BRAVE THAN HE
HANS AND THE ICELANDERS NEVER STIRRED
RUSHED BOUNDING DOWN THE ABYSS AND IN THEIR FALL AWOKE ECHOES REMARKABLE FOR THEIR LOUD AND WELL DEFINED SHARPNESS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CONE THERE WERE GLACIERS HERE HANS ADVANCED ONLY WITH EXTREME PRECAUTION
THE FANCIFUL CREATION OF SCANDINAVIAN SUPERSTITIONS I FELT INTOXICATED WITH THE SUBLIME PLEASURE OF LOFTY ELEVATIONS WITHOUT THINKING OF THE PROFOUND ABYSSES INTO WHICH I WAS SHORTLY TO BE PLUNGED
HERE WE ARE AT THE TOP OF SNAEFELL AND HERE ARE TWO PEAKS
ANOTHER NEW AND EXCEPTIONALLY POWERFUL MOTOR CAR WILL ARRIVE AT TOAD HALL ON APPROVAL OR RETURN AT THIS VERY MOMENT PERHAPS TOAD IS BUSY ARRAYING HIMSELF IN THOSE SINGULARLY HIDEOUS HABILIMENTS SO DEAR TO HIM
ABOUT EIGHT IN THE EVENING HE SIGNALLED TO STOP HANS SAT DOWN AT ONCE THE LAMPS WERE HUNG UPON A PROJECTION IN THE LAVA WE WERE IN A SORT OF CAVERN WHERE THERE WAS PLENTY OF AIR CERTAIN PUFFS OF AIR REACHED US
SOUNDING HIS WAY WITH HIS IRON POINTED POLE TO DISCOVER ANY CREVASSES IN IT
AND DURING THAWS THE WHITE BEARS
BUT NO I SAW HIM WITH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED AND LEGS STRADDLING WIDE APART ERECT BEFORE A GRANITE ROCK THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE CRATER JUST LIKE A PEDESTAL MADE READY TO RECEIVE A STATUE OF PLUTO
HE MUST NEVER BE LEFT AN INSTANT UNGUARDED WE SHALL HAVE TO TAKE IT IN TURNS TO BE WITH HIM TILL THE POISON HAS WORKED ITSELF OUT OF HIS SYSTEM THEY ARRANGED WATCHES ACCORDINGLY
THE ORDER TO HALT THEREFORE GAVE ME PLEASURE HANS LAID OUR PROVISIONS UPON A BLOCK OF LAVA AND WE ATE WITH A GOOD APPETITE BUT ONE THING TROUBLED ME OUR SUPPLY OF WATER WAS HALF CONSUMED
THE SUPREME HOUR HAD COME I MIGHT NOW EITHER SHARE IN THE ENTERPRISE OR REFUSE TO MOVE FORWARD BUT I WAS ASHAMED TO RECOIL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HUNTER HANS ACCEPTED THE ENTERPRISE WITH SUCH CALMNESS SUCH INDIFFERENCE
THIS WAS A WONDERFUL THING INDEED THAT THE BADGER SHOULD PAY A FORMAL CALL ON THEM OR INDEED ON ANYBODY HE GENERALLY HAD TO BE CAUGHT IF YOU WANTED HIM BADLY AS HE SLIPPED QUIETLY ALONG A HEDGEROW OF AN EARLY MORNING OR A LATE EVENING
HE WAS LOOKING VERY HARD AT TOAD AS HE SAID THIS AND COULD NOT HELP THINKING HE PERCEIVED SOMETHING VAGUELY RESEMBLING A TWINKLE IN THAT ANIMAL'S STILL SORROWFUL EYE THERE'S ONLY ONE THING MORE TO BE DONE CONTINUED THE GRATIFIED BADGER TOAD
AND FOUR HUNDRED FEET LONG FIRST HE DROPPED HALF OF IT DOWN THEN HE PASSED IT ROUND A LAVA BLOCK THAT PROJECTED CONVENIENTLY AND THREW THE OTHER HALF DOWN THE CHIMNEY EACH OF US COULD THEN DESCEND BY HOLDING WITH THE HAND BOTH HALVES OF THE ROPE
AND SENT THEM BODILY DOWN THE GULF BEFORE US I LISTENED TO THE DULL THUDS OF THE DESCENDING BALE MY UNCLE LEANING OVER THE ABYSS FOLLOWED THE DESCENT OF THE LUGGAGE WITH A SATISFIED NOD AND ONLY ROSE ERECT WHEN HE HAD QUITE LOST SIGHT OF IT
POINTED TO THIS FACT THAT THE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS CAME TO TOUCH THAT PARTICULAR WAY DURING THE LATTER DAYS OF THE MONTH OF JUNE THAT SHARP PEAK MIGHT HENCE BE CONSIDERED AS THE GNOMON OF A VAST SUN DIAL
BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GUIDE I HELD MY PEACE MY HEART FLEW BACK TO MY SWEET VIRLANDAISE AND I APPROACHED THE CENTRAL CHIMNEY I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT IT WAS A HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER AND THREE HUNDRED FEET ROUND
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAVE MADE NO GREAT PROGRESS VERTICALLY WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT
AFTER SOME THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BADGER REAPPEARED SOLEMNLY LEADING BY THE PAW A VERY LIMP AND DEJECTED TOAD HIS SKIN HUNG BAGGILY ABOUT HIM
HIS HEARTY ACCENTS FALTERED AND FELL AWAY AS HE NOTICED THE STERN UNBENDING LOOK ON THE COUNTENANCES OF HIS SILENT FRIENDS AND HIS INVITATION REMAINED UNFINISHED THE BADGER STRODE UP THE STEPS TAKE HIM INSIDE HE SAID STERNLY TO HIS COMPANIONS
HE TOOK TOAD FIRMLY BY THE ARM LED HIM INTO THE SMOKING ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM THAT'S NO GOOD SAID THE RAT CONTEMPTUOUSLY
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS THEY NEARED THE DOOR IT WAS FLUNG OPEN AND MISTER TOAD ARRAYED IN GOGGLES CAP GAITERS AND ENORMOUS OVERCOAT CAME SWAGGERING DOWN THE STEPS DRAWING ON HIS GAUNTLETED GLOVES HULLO
MARILLA FELT THAT IN SOME STRANGE WAY HIS MARRIAGE WITH ANNE WOULD PUT RIGHT THAT OLD MISTAKE GOOD HAD COME OUT OF THE EVIL OF THE ANCIENT BITTERNESS AS FOR ANNE HERSELF SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE ALMOST FELT FRIGHTENED
IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT JIMMY SAID MUCH OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PAST LIFE OF HIS BEFORE SHE HAD KNOWN HIM AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SHE PROMPTED POLLYANNA HAD FOR THE MOMENT FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT OF THE CONTROVERSY
SO GILBERT DIDN'T GO BACK ON YOU AFTER ALL SAID MISSUS HARMON ANDREWS CONTRIVING TO CONVEY AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE IN HER TONE
FORE MISS POLLYANNA COME SAY MISTER TOM WHO WAS HER A LOVER I HAIN'T FOUND THAT OUT YET I HAIN'T I HAIN'T HAIN'T YE ASKED THE OLD MAN WITH AN ODD LOOK ON HIS FACE
BUT THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO LACK OF JOYFUL GREETINGS ON THE PART OF EVERYBODY FROM THE MOMENT SHE STEPPED FROM THE RAILWAY TRAIN WITH HER AUNT POLLY AND DOCTOR CHILTON NOR DID POLLYANNA LOSE ANY TIME
CAUSE I WAS ALREADY BENT PART WAY OVER NANCY GAVE A WISTFUL LAUGH WELL I AIN'T SURPRISED AFTER ALL YOU MIGHT KNOW SHE'D FIND SOMETHIN WE'VE BEEN PLAYIN IT THAT GAME SINCE ALMOST THE FIRST
IF YOU KNEW HALF AS MUCH AS HE DOES YOU'D KNOW THAT TOO SHE FINISHED WITH FLASHING EYES JIMMY PENDLETON FLUSHED MISERABLY AND LOOKED UTTERLY WRETCHED
WELL I GUESS YE WON'T THEN FROM ME OH MISTER TOM COME ON NOW WHEEDLED THE GIRL YE SEE THERE AIN'T MANY FOLKS HERE THAT I CAN ASK MAYBE NOT BUT THERE'S ONE ANYHOW THAT AIN'T ANSWERIN
IT SEEMS REAL STRANGE
I CAN'T REALIZE THAT SHE'S GROWN UP I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT I FELT WHEN I SAW MATTHEW BRINGING IN A GIRL
ON MOST OCCASIONS SHE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THE INTEREST SHOWN BUT ONE DAY SHE MET WITH A SURPRISE IT CAME THROUGH JIMMY PENDLETON SAY LOOK A HERE HE DEMANDED ONE AFTERNOON IRRITABLY
IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS PRAYED FOR SAID MISSUS RACHEL IN THE TONE OF ONE WHO IS COMFORTABLY SURE THAT HER PRAYERS HAVE AVAILED MUCH IT WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO FIND OUT THAT SHE REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE THE KINGSPORT MAN
AND I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE CUT DOWN AND THIS LAST SPRING THEY WERE WHITE AND SUCH A CROP OF PLUMS I NEVER REMEMBER AT GREEN GABLES
IF IF YOU DON'T MIND VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DOCTOR CHILTON TRULY I WOULD A DISTRESSED COLOR SUFFUSED MISS POLLY'S FACE FOR A MOMENT SHE DID NOT SPEAK AT ALL
SHE WA'N'T THERE AND ALWAYS EVERYWHERE SHE WENT POLLYANNA MET THE QUESTION WELL HOW DID YOU LIKE BOSTON PERHAPS TO NO ONE DID SHE ANSWER THIS MORE FULLY THAN SHE DID TO MISTER PENDLETON
I COULDN'T GUESS I WOULDN'T THINK SHE COULD FIND ANYTHIN ABOUT THAT TER BE GLAD ABOUT SHE DID SHE SAID I COULD BE GLAD ANYHOW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TER STOOP SO FAR TER DO MY WEEDIN
THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T CARE TO KNOW EACH OTHER HE ASKED QUIZZICALLY OH BUT SOME OF THEM DO MAINTAINED POLLYANNA IN EAGER DEFENSE
WE STOPPED MOST A WEEK WITH A FARMER DAD HELPED ABOUT THE HAYIN' AND I DID TOO SOME THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS AWFUL GOOD TO ME AND PRETTY QUICK SHE WAS CALLIN ME JAMIE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT SHE JUST DID
AN MISS POLLYANNA LOOKIN ON AN BOSSIN FROM THE BED
AND YOU'VE KNOWN ME EVER SINCE REPEATED JIMMY BUT IN A FAR DIFFERENT VOICE JIMMY HAD SUDDENLY COME BACK TO THE PRESENT AND TO HIS GRIEVANCE BUT THEN I AIN'T JAMIE YOU KNOW HE FINISHED WITH SCORNFUL EMPHASIS
IT WAS SURELY THEIR DUTY TO PUT THE MATTER BEFORE HER IN ANOTHER LIGHT YET THESE TWO WORTHY LADIES WERE NOT ENEMIES OF ANNE ON THE CONTRARY THEY WERE REALLY QUITE FOND OF HER
THERE AIN'T NO SPECIAL DIFF'RENCE AS I CAN SEE OR ANYBODY I GUESS SHE JEST LAYS THERE AN SLEEPS AN TALKS SOME AN TRIES TER SMILE AN BE GLAD CAUSE THE SUN SETS OR THE MOON RISES OR SOME OTHER SUCH THING
I HOPE YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY YOU HAVE MY BEST WISHES I'M SURE A LONG ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T OFTEN TURN OUT WELL BUT OF COURSE IN YOUR CASE IT COULDN'T BE HELPED
I NEVER SUPPOSED SHE'D WANT THEM THEY'RE SO OLD FASHIONED AND NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT ANYTHING BUT HOOKED MATS NOW BUT SHE ASKED ME FOR THEM SAID SHE'D RATHER HAVE THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR HER FLOORS THEY ARE PRETTY
WELL SHE DIDN'T TELL MISS POLLY REJOINED NANCY MISS POLLYANNA TOLD ME LONG AGO THAT SHE COULDN'T TELL HER CAUSE HER AUNT DIDN'T LIKE TER HAVE HER TALK ABOUT HER FATHER AN TWAS HER FATHER'S GAME
HER CHEEKS WERE VERY RED TOO I SAY IF YOU LOVED DOCTOR CHILTON AND DIDN'T LOVE THE OTHER ONE SIGHED POLLYANNA SEEMS TO ME THAT WOULD MAKE SOME DIFFERENCE IN THE GOOD HE WOULD DO AND I LOVE DOCTOR CHILTON
THAT WOULD BE EXPECTING TOO MUCH BUT THERE IS A BROOK AND IT ACTUALLY CUTS ACROSS ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN THEN SAID ANNE WITH A LONG SIGH OF SUPREME SATISFACTION
I'D BELIEVE ANYTHIN O THE MISTRESS NOW EVEN THAT SHE'D TAKE TER PLAYIN IT HERSELF BUT HAIN'T THE LITTLE GAL TOLD HER EVER SHE'S TOLD EV'RY ONE ELSE I GUESS I'M HEARIN OF IT EV'RYWHERE NOW SINCE SHE WAS HURTED SAID TOM
BUT THE DEEPS OF HAPPINESS BELOW COULD NOT THUS BE DISTURBED AND THE LITTLE STINGS OF MESDAMES BELL AND ANDREWS WERE FORGOTTEN WHEN GILBERT CAME LATER AND THEY WANDERED DOWN TO THE BIRCHES OF THE BROOK WHICH HAD BEEN SAPLINGS WHEN ANNE HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES
SHE WAS OWNED BY A CHINAMAN CHARTERED BY AN ARAB AND COMMANDED BY A SORT OF RENEGADE NEW SOUTH WALES GERMAN VERY ANXIOUS TO CURSE PUBLICLY HIS NATIVE COUNTRY BUT WHO APPARENTLY ON THE STRENGTH OF BISMARCK'S VICTORIOUS POLICY
LIKE WATER FLOWING INTO CREVICES AND CRANNIES LIKE WATER RISING SILENTLY EVEN WITH THE RIM EIGHT HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN WITH FAITH AND HOPES WITH AFFECTIONS AND MEMORIES THEY HAD COLLECTED THERE
THE FACTS THOSE MEN WERE SO EAGER TO KNOW HAD BEEN VISIBLE TANGIBLE OPEN TO THE SENSES OCCUPYING THEIR PLACE IN SPACE AND TIME REQUIRING FOR THEIR EXISTENCE A FOURTEEN HUNDRED TON STEAMER
THE MISTS WERE CLOSING AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD I APPEARED TO HIM AND HOW MUCH WISE NOT HALF AS OLD AS I FELT JUST THEN NOT HALF AS USELESSLY WISE AS I KNEW MYSELF TO BE
HE HAD COME ACROSS THAT MAN BEFORE IN THE STREET PERHAPS HE WAS POSITIVE HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM FOR DAYS FOR MANY DAYS HE HAD SPOKEN TO NO ONE BUT HAD HELD SILENT INCOHERENT AND ENDLESS CONVERSE WITH HIMSELF
AND WAS PLACATED BY THE SOUND OF A FAINT SIGH THAT PASSED BETWEEN US LIKE THE FLIGHT OF A BIRD IN THE NIGHT WELL I WASN'T HE SAID COURAGEOUSLY IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRETCHED STORY THEY MADE UP IT WAS NOT A LIE
AND IN DRILL SUITS THAT SEEMED TO FIT THEM AS CLOSE AS THEIR SKINS AND HOLDING THEIR ROUND PITH HATS ON THEIR KNEES WHILE GLIDING ALONG THE WALLS THE COURT PEONS BUTTONED TIGHT IN LONG WHITE COATS FLITTED RAPIDLY TO AND FRO
RESTED UPON A WHITE MAN WHO SAT APART FROM THE OTHERS WITH HIS FACE WORN AND CLOUDED BUT WITH QUIET EYES THAT GLANCED STRAIGHT INTERESTED AND CLEAR JIM ANSWERED ANOTHER QUESTION AND WAS TEMPTED TO CRY OUT
AND THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY WAS BEING HELD IN THE POLICE COURT OF AN EASTERN PORT HE STOOD ELEVATED IN THE WITNESS BOX WITH BURNING CHEEKS IN A COOL LOFTY ROOM
THE BIG FRAMEWORK OF PUNKAHS MOVED GENTLY TO AND FRO HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND FROM BELOW MANY EYES WERE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF DARK FACES OUT OF WHITE FACES OUT OF RED FACES OUT OF FACES ATTENTIVE SPELLBOUND
AS IF FACTS COULD EXPLAIN ANYTHING AFTER YOU HAD CONCLUDED YOU HAD COLLIDED WITH SOMETHING FLOATING AWASH SAY A WATER LOGGED WRECK YOU WERE ORDERED BY YOUR CAPTAIN TO GO FORWARD AND ASCERTAIN IF THERE WAS ANY DAMAGE DONE
AND AUDIBLY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AFTER DINNER ON A VERANDAH DRAPED IN MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS IN THE DEEP DUSK SPECKLED BY FIERY CIGAR ENDS THE ELONGATED BULK OF EACH CANE CHAIR
BUT I KNEW THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LIVE IT DOWN ALONE WITH MYSELF I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IN TO SUCH A BEASTLY UNFAIR THING WHAT DID IT PROVE AFTER ALL I WAS CONFOUNDEDLY CUT UP SICK OF LIFE
TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HIS LEFT ARM WAS BROKEN HE HAD SLIPPED ON THE TOP STEP WHEN GETTING DOWN WHILE I WAS FORWARD HE EXCLAIMED MY GOD THAT ROTTEN BULKHEAD'LL GIVE WAY IN A MINUTE
HOW THIS ONE HAD AN EASY BILLET IN JAPAN SOMEWHERE AND THAT ONE WAS DOING WELL IN THE SIAMESE NAVY AND IN ALL THEY SAID IN THEIR ACTIONS IN THEIR LOOKS IN THEIR PERSONS COULD BE DETECTED THE SOFT SPOT THE PLACE OF DECAY
LIGHTED BY FESTAL SUNSHINE ITS SHIPS LIKE TOYS ITS BRILLIANT ACTIVITY RESEMBLING A HOLIDAY PAGEANT WITH THE ETERNAL SERENITY OF THE EASTERN SKY OVERHEAD AND THE SMILING PEACE OF THE EASTERN SEAS
DISABLED BY A FALLING SPAR AT THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK OF WHICH HIS SCOTTISH CAPTAIN USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS MAN IT'S A PAIRFECT MEERACLE TO ME HOW SHE LIVED THROUGH IT SPENT MANY DAYS STRETCHED ON HIS BACK DAZED BATTERED HOPELESS
AS IF ALL THESE PEOPLE SITTING IN ORDERLY ROWS UPON NARROW BENCHES HAD BEEN ENSLAVED BY THE FASCINATION OF HIS VOICE IT WAS VERY LOUD IT RANG STARTLING IN HIS OWN EARS IT WAS THE ONLY SOUND AUDIBLE IN THE WORLD
LIKE THIS HE SAID IT DOES ME GOOD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME YOU DON'T WORDS SEEMED TO FAIL HIM IT WAS A DISTINCT GLIMPSE HE WAS A YOUNGSTER OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO SEE ABOUT YOU
CHAPTER TWO AFTER TWO YEARS OF TRAINING HE WENT TO SEA AND ENTERING THE REGIONS SO WELL KNOWN TO HIS IMAGINATION FOUND THEM STRANGELY BARREN OF ADVENTURE HE MADE MANY VOYAGES
HE PRONOUNCED WITH A CONVULSIVE EFFORT WHOSE STRESS AS IF PROPAGATED BY THE WAVES OF THE AIR MADE MY BODY STIR A LITTLE IN THE CHAIR HE FIXED ME WITH LOWERING EYES DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME HE CRIED I SWEAR
AND ON THE SECRET PURPOSES OF THEIR HEARTS THE STEAMER POUNDED IN THE DUSK THE CALM WATER OF THE STRAIT AND FAR ASTERN OF THE PILGRIM SHIP A SCREW PILE LIGHTHOUSE PLANTED BY UNBELIEVERS ON A TREACHEROUS SHOAL SEEMED TO WINK AT HER
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THIS WHAT'S THE GOOD HE TAPPED WITH HIS FOOT SLIGHTLY BIT HIS LIP AND LOOKED AWAY OVER THE HEADS HE MET THE EYES OF THE WHITE MAN THE GLANCE DIRECTED AT HIM WAS NOT THE FASCINATED STARE OF THE OTHERS
THAT THIS COMPLICATION OF ACCIDENTS OR THESE ELEMENTAL FURIES ARE COMING AT HIM WITH A PURPOSE OF MALICE WITH A STRENGTH BEYOND CONTROL WITH AN UNBRIDLED CRUELTY THAT MEANS TO TEAR OUT OF HIM HIS HOPE AND HIS FEAR
SAID THE GERMAN SKIPPER TO HIS NEW CHIEF MATE AN ARAB THE LEADER OF THAT PIOUS VOYAGE CAME LAST HE WALKED SLOWLY ABOARD HANDSOME AND GRAVE IN HIS WHITE GOWN AND LARGE TURBAN A STRING OF SERVANTS FOLLOWED LOADED WITH HIS LUGGAGE
HELD ON HER STEADFAST WAY BLACK AND SMOULDERING IN A LUMINOUS IMMENSITY AS IF SCORCHED BY A FLAME FLICKED AT HER FROM A HEAVEN WITHOUT PITY
THEY AND ONLY THEY CAN BRING US TIDINGS FROM THAT DEAR COUNTRY WHERE WE ONCE SOJOURNED AND FROM WHICH WE MUST EVERMORE BE EXILES THE WORLD CALLS THEM ITS SINGERS AND POETS AND ARTISTS AND STORY TELLERS
MISSUS ALLEN SAID CATHERINE THE NEXT MORNING WILL THERE BE ANY HARM IN MY CALLING ON MISS TILNEY TODAY I SHALL NOT BE EASY TILL I HAVE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING GO BY ALL MEANS MY DEAR ONLY PUT ON A WHITE GOWN MISS TILNEY ALWAYS WEARS WHITE
I THINK THERE IS SUCH A PLACE IN SPITE OF UNCLE EDWARD SAID THE STORY GIRL DREAMILY AND I THINK THERE IS A WAY OF GETTING THERE TOO IF WE COULD ONLY FIND IT
SHE WAS UPON THE WHOLE LEFT ONE OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD WHILE TALKING TO EACH OTHER
EDWARD SAW ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND NOT ONLY THE MEANING OF OTHERS BUT SUCH OF MARIANNE'S EXPRESSIONS AS HAD PUZZLED HIM BEFORE AND WHEN THEIR VISITORS LEFT THEM HE WENT IMMEDIATELY ROUND HER AND SAID IN A WHISPER I HAVE BEEN GUESSING SHALL I TELL YOU MY GUESS
I SHALL TELL IT TOO I DON'T CARE IF THE JOKE IS AS MUCH ON MYSELF AS ANY ONE A STORY IS A STORY NO MATTER WHO IT'S ON BUT IT IS HATEFUL TO BE LAUGHED AT AND GROWN UPS ALWAYS DO IT I NEVER WILL WHEN I'M GROWN UP I'LL REMEMBER BETTER
BUT AS IT WAS SHE ONLY LEARNED FROM SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT LOOKS HOW FAR THEIR PENETRATION FOUNDED ON MARGARET'S INSTRUCTIONS EXTENDED SIR JOHN NEVER CAME TO THE DASHWOODS WITHOUT EITHER INVITING THEM TO DINE AT THE PARK THE NEXT DAY OR TO DRINK TEA WITH THEM THAT EVENING
MARIANNE LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AT EDWARD WITH COMPASSION AT HER SISTER
I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
EVERY OTHER LOOK UPON AN AVERAGE WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE BOX AND FOR THE SPACE OF TWO ENTIRE SCENES DID SHE THUS WATCH HENRY TILNEY WITHOUT BEING ONCE ABLE TO CATCH HIS EYE NO LONGER COULD HE BE SUSPECTED OF INDIFFERENCE FOR A PLAY
CATHERINE IN DEEP MORTIFICATION PROCEEDED ON HER WAY SHE COULD ALMOST BE ANGRY HERSELF AT SUCH ANGRY INCIVILITY BUT SHE CHECKED THE RESENTFUL SENSATION SHE REMEMBERED HER OWN IGNORANCE SHE KNEW NOT HOW SUCH AN OFFENCE AS HERS MIGHT BE CLASSED BY THE LAWS OF WORLDLY POLITENESS
AND MISSUS ALLEN'S WAVERING CONVICTIONS ONLY MADE IT MORE DOUBTFUL TO MILSOM STREET SHE WAS DIRECTED AND HAVING MADE HERSELF PERFECT IN THE NUMBER HASTENED AWAY WITH EAGER STEPS AND A BEATING HEART TO PAY HER VISIT EXPLAIN HER CONDUCT AND BE FORGIVEN
CECILY AND SARA RAY FOUND A SWEET NEW KNITTED LACE PATTERN IN AN OLD MAGAZINE
WHO PLEDGED ALL COMERS IN A GOLDEN CUP WITH JEWELS BRIGHT AND IF YOU DRANK OF THE CUP WITH HER SAID THE STORY GIRL HER EYES GLOWING THROUGH THE EMERALD DUSK ABOUT US YOU WERE NEVER SEEN IN THE WORLD AGAIN YOU WERE WHISKED STRAIGHTWAY TO FAIRYLAND AND LIVED THERE WITH A FAIRY BRIDE
WHY WERE YOU LESS GENEROUS THAN YOUR SISTER IF SHE FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE IN MY GOOD INTENTIONS AND COULD SUPPOSE IT TO BE ONLY A MISTAKE WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO READY TO TAKE OFFENCE ME I TAKE OFFENCE
YOU'D UNDERSTAND WHY IF YOU EVER SAW HIM AT A PARTY OR A PICNIC SAID FELICITY TRYING TO PASS PLATES AND DROPPING THEM WHENEVER A WOMAN LOOKED AT HIM THEY SAY IT'S PITIFUL TO SEE HIM I MUST GET WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THAT MAN NEXT SUMMER SAID THE STORY GIRL
AND THAT IS THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE ON THAT DAY THE GATES OF EDEN ARE SHUT BEHIND THEM AND THE AGE OF GOLD IS OVER HENCEFORTH THEY MUST DWELL IN THE COMMON LIGHT OF COMMON DAY ONLY A FEW WHO REMAIN CHILDREN AT HEART CAN EVER FIND THAT FAIR LOST PATH AGAIN
AND WAS ONLY TOO AGREEABLE FOR CATHERINE TO BE CONTENTED WHEN HE WENT AWAY BEFORE THEY PARTED HOWEVER IT WAS AGREED THAT THE PROJECTED WALK SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SETTING ASIDE THE MISERY OF HIS QUITTING THEIR BOX
MY DEAR YOU TUMBLE MY GOWN WAS MISSUS ALLEN'S REPLY HER ASSURANCE HOWEVER STANDING SOLE AS IT DID WAS NOT THROWN AWAY IT BROUGHT A MORE CORDIAL MORE NATURAL SMILE INTO HIS COUNTENANCE
CATHERINE CHEERFULLY COMPLIED AND BEING PROPERLY EQUIPPED WAS MORE IMPATIENT THAN EVER TO BE AT THE PUMP ROOM THAT SHE MIGHT INFORM HERSELF OF GENERAL TILNEY'S LODGINGS FOR THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE HOUSE
IT DON'T SOUND A BIT LIKE OTHER CLOCKS
SOMEBODY KILLED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING LIKE THAT EVER HAPPENED IN OUR FAMILY THE KINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RESPECTABLE PERHAPS IT IS EMILY
TO THE THEATRE ACCORDINGLY THEY ALL WENT NO TILNEYS APPEARED TO PLAGUE OR PLEASE HER SHE FEARED THAT AMONGST THE MANY PERFECTIONS OF THE FAMILY A FONDNESS FOR PLAYS WAS NOT TO BE RANKED BUT PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE HABITUATED TO THE FINER PERFORMANCES OF THE LONDON STAGE
BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER HAIR HAD BEEN DARKER MARIANNE SPOKE INCONSIDERATELY WHAT SHE REALLY FELT BUT WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH SHE HAD PAINED EDWARD HER OWN VEXATION AT HER WANT OF THOUGHT COULD NOT BE SURPASSED BY HIS
AND IS DISGUSTED WITH SUCH PRETENSIONS HE AFFECTS GREATER INDIFFERENCE AND LESS DISCRIMINATION IN VIEWING THEM HIMSELF THAN HE POSSESSES HE IS FASTIDIOUS AND WILL HAVE AN AFFECTATION OF HIS OWN IT IS VERY TRUE SAID MARIANNE THAT ADMIRATION OF LANDSCAPE SCENERY
WAS WHITE AND CLEAR AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF SPRUCES WE WERE WOEFULLY TIRED BUT WE COULD NOT SIT DOWN BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS REEKING WITH DEW THE FAMILY GHOST ONLY APPEARS IN DAYLIGHT SAID THE STORY GIRL
ON THE PRESENT OCCASION FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR TOWARDS WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT SAID HE
AS SHE POINTED THEM OUT TO HER COMPANION HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT HIS FATHER LIKE EVERY MILITARY MAN
WHILE HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN IT APPEARED SO IMPERFECT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY SHE WISHED IT WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT HE STILL DISTINGUISHED HER BY THE SAME AFFECTION WHICH ONCE SHE HAD FELT NO DOUBT OF INSPIRING
BUT INDEED I DID NOT WISH YOU A PLEASANT WALK I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING BUT I BEGGED MISTER THORPE SO EARNESTLY TO STOP I CALLED OUT TO HIM AS SOON AS EVER I SAW YOU NOW MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT OH YOU WERE NOT THERE BUT INDEED I DID AND IF MISTER THORPE WOULD ONLY HAVE STOPPED
SHOULD SUCH EMERGENCIES AT ANY TIME HAPPEN UNDER THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THERE COULD BE NO REMEDY BUT FORCE THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED MUST BE PROPORTIONED TO THE EXTENT OF THE MISCHIEF IF IT SHOULD BE A SLIGHT COMMOTION IN A SMALL PART OF A STATE
THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE BETRAY THEIR CONSTITUENTS THERE IS THEN NO RESOURCE LEFT BUT IN THE EXERTION OF THAT ORIGINAL RIGHT OF SELF DEFENSE WHICH IS PARAMOUNT TO ALL POSITIVE FORMS OF GOVERNMENT
AN INSURRECTION WHATEVER MAY BE ITS IMMEDIATE CAUSE EVENTUALLY ENDANGERS ALL GOVERNMENT REGARD TO THE PUBLIC PEACE IF NOT TO THE RIGHTS OF THE UNION WOULD ENGAGE THE CITIZENS TO WHOM THE CONTAGION HAD NOT COMMUNICATED ITSELF TO OPPOSE THE INSURGENTS
IF THE FEDERAL ARMY SHOULD BE ABLE TO QUELL THE RESISTANCE OF ONE STATE THE DISTANT STATES WOULD HAVE IT IN THEIR POWER TO MAKE HEAD WITH FRESH FORCES THE ADVANTAGES OBTAINED IN ONE PLACE MUST BE ABANDONED TO SUBDUE THE OPPOSITION IN OTHERS
COULD SHE HAVE HOPED FOR SUCCESS IN SUCH AN ENTERPRISE FROM THE EFFORTS OF THE MILITIA ALONE
THE DIFFERENT PARCELS SUBDIVISIONS OR DISTRICTS OF WHICH IT CONSISTS
WHICH CAN NEVER BE TOO HIGHLY PRIZED IT MAY SAFELY BE RECEIVED AS AN AXIOM IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT THE STATE GOVERNMENTS WILL IN ALL POSSIBLE CONTINGENCIES AFFORD COMPLETE SECURITY AGAINST INVASIONS OF THE PUBLIC LIBERTY BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY
TO ESTABLISH A TYRANNY BUT IN A CONFEDERACY THE PEOPLE WITHOUT EXAGGERATION MAY BE SAID TO BE ENTIRELY THE MASTERS OF THEIR OWN FATE POWER BEING ALMOST ALWAYS THE RIVAL OF POWER
OUR OWN EXPERIENCE HAS CORROBORATED THE LESSONS TAUGHT BY THE EXAMPLES OF OTHER NATIONS THAT EMERGENCIES OF THIS SORT WILL SOMETIMES ARISE IN ALL SOCIETIES HOWEVER CONSTITUTED
PROJECTS OF USURPATION CANNOT BE MASKED UNDER PRETENSES SO LIKELY TO ESCAPE THE PENETRATION OF SELECT BODIES OF MEN AS OF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE THE LEGISLATURES WILL HAVE BETTER MEANS OF INFORMATION THEY CAN DISCOVER THE DANGER AT A DISTANCE
THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED THE IDEA OF RESTRAINING THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY IN REGARD TO THE COMMON DEFENSE CONSIDERED FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THE GREAT EXTENT OF THE COUNTRY IS A FURTHER SECURITY WE HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED ITS UTILITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF A FOREIGN POWER AND IT WOULD HAVE PRECISELY THE SAME EFFECT AGAINST THE ENTERPRISES OF AMBITIOUS RULERS IN THE NATIONAL COUNCILS
IT WERE IRRATIONAL TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE DISINCLINED TO ITS SUPPORT IF ON THE CONTRARY THE INSURRECTION SHOULD PERVADE A WHOLE STATE OR A PRINCIPAL PART OF IT THE EMPLOYMENT OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF FORCE MIGHT BECOME UNAVOIDABLE
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN TOLD IS THE ONLY ADMISSIBLE PRINCIPLE OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT HAS NO PLACE BUT IN THE REVERIES OF THOSE POLITICAL DOCTORS WHOSE SAGACITY DISDAINS THE ADMONITIONS OF EXPERIMENTAL INSTRUCTION
WOULD NOT THE SAME DIFFICULTY OPPOSE ITSELF TO THE OPERATIONS OF EITHER OF THESE CONFEDERACIES WOULD NOT EACH OF THEM BE EXPOSED TO THE SAME CASUALTIES
THE PEOPLE BY THROWING THEMSELVES INTO EITHER SCALE WILL INFALLIBLY MAKE IT PREPONDERATE IF THEIR RIGHTS ARE INVADED BY EITHER
THAT SEDITIONS AND INSURRECTIONS ARE UNHAPPILY MALADIES AS INSEPARABLE FROM THE BODY POLITIC AS TUMORS AND ERUPTIONS FROM THE NATURAL BODY THAT THE IDEA OF GOVERNING AT ALL TIMES BY THE SIMPLE FORCE OF LAW
AND WHICH AGAINST THE USURPATIONS OF THE NATIONAL RULERS MAY BE EXERTED WITH INFINITELY BETTER PROSPECT OF SUCCESS THAN AGAINST THOSE OF THE RULERS OF AN INDIVIDUAL STATE IN A SINGLE STATE IF THE PERSONS INTRUSTED WITH SUPREME POWER BECOME USURPERS
THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE UNDER A LIKE NECESSITY IN SIMILAR EXTREMITIES BE MADE AN OBJECTION TO ITS EXISTENCE IS IT NOT SURPRISING THAT MEN WHO DECLARE AN ATTACHMENT TO THE UNION IN THE ABSTRACT SHOULD URGE AS AN OBJECTION TO THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION
WHO WOULD NOT PREFER THAT POSSIBILITY TO THE UNCEASING AGITATIONS AND FREQUENT REVOLUTIONS WHICH ARE THE CONTINUAL SCOURGES OF PETTY REPUBLICS LET US PURSUE THIS EXAMINATION IN ANOTHER LIGHT SUPPOSE IN LIEU OF ONE GENERAL SYSTEM
WITHOUT CONCERT WITHOUT SYSTEM WITHOUT RESOURCE EXCEPT IN THEIR COURAGE AND DESPAIR THE USURPERS CLOTHED WITH THE FORMS OF LEGAL AUTHORITY CAN TOO OFTEN CRUSH THE OPPOSITION IN EMBRYO THE SMALLER THE EXTENT OF THE TERRITORY
TO SAY THAT THE WHOLE POWER OF THE PROPOSED GOVERNMENT IS TO BE IN THE HANDS OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE THIS IS THE ESSENTIAL AND AFTER ALL ONLY EFFICACIOUS SECURITY FOR THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE WHICH IS ATTAINABLE IN CIVIL SOCIETY
WHICH AMOUNT TO INSURRECTIONS AND REBELLIONS INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER REASONINGS UPON THE SUBJECT
THE MORE DIFFICULT WILL IT BE FOR THE PEOPLE TO FORM A REGULAR OR SYSTEMATIC PLAN OF OPPOSITION
INTELLIGENCE CAN BE MORE SPEEDILY OBTAINED OF THEIR PREPARATIONS AND MOVEMENTS AND THE MILITARY FORCE IN THE POSSESSION OF THE USURPERS CAN BE MORE RAPIDLY DIRECTED AGAINST THE PART WHERE THE OPPOSITION HAS BEGUN
PROVIDED THE CITIZENS UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS AND ARE DISPOSED TO DEFEND THEM THE NATURAL STRENGTH OF THE PEOPLE IN A LARGE COMMUNITY
IT APPEARS THAT MASSACHUSETTS FOUND IT NECESSARY TO RAISE TROOPS FOR REPRESSING THE DISORDERS WITHIN THAT STATE THAT PENNSYLVANIA FROM THE MERE APPREHENSION OF COMMOTIONS AMONG A PART OF HER CITIZENS HAS THOUGHT PROPER TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE SAME MEASURE
IF IT MUST THEN BE ADMITTED THAT THE NECESSITY OF RECURRING TO A FORCE DIFFERENT FROM THE MILITIA IN CASES OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY NATURE IS APPLICABLE TO THE STATE GOVERNMENTS THEMSELVES WHY SHOULD THE POSSIBILITY
THAT THE EXTENT OF THE MILITARY FORCE MUST AT ALL EVENTS BE REGULATED BY THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME TO COME IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN A LARGE ARMY
AND THE MOMENT THE PART WHICH HAD BEEN REDUCED TO SUBMISSION WAS LEFT TO ITSELF ITS EFFORTS WOULD BE RENEWED AND ITS RESISTANCE REVIVE WE SHOULD RECOLLECT
WHAT APPLIES WITH TENFOLD WEIGHT TO THE PLAN FOR WHICH THEY CONTEND AND WHAT AS FAR AS IT HAS ANY FOUNDATION IN TRUTH IS AN INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF CIVIL SOCIETY UPON AN ENLARGED SCALE
BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS
I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED
CHAPTER FIVE THROUGH SOLWAY SANDS THROUGH TAROSS MOSS BLINDFOLD HE KNEW THE PATHS TO CROSS BY WILY TURNS BY DESPERATE BOUNDS HAD BAFFLED PERCY'S BEST BLOODHOUNDS
IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEM ONE JOT LESS AGREEABLE BUT IT MUST VERY MATERIALLY LESSEN THEIR CHANCE OF MARRYING MEN OF ANY CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD REPLIED DARCY TO THIS SPEECH BINGLEY MADE NO ANSWER
NOT THAT I THINK CHARLOTTE SO VERY PLAIN BUT THEN SHE IS OUR PARTICULAR FRIEND
WALTER SCOTT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE WHARTON FAMILY LAID THEIR HEADS ON THEIR PILLOWS THAT NIGHT WITH A FOREBODING OF SOME INTERRUPTION TO THEIR ORDINARY QUIET UNEASINESS KEPT THE SISTERS FROM ENJOYING THEIR USUAL REPOSE
MISTER HARPER ECHOED THE OTHER FEELING A LOAD REMOVED FROM HIS HEART YES I HAD FORGOTTEN BUT HE IS GONE AND IF THERE BE ANYTHING WRONG IN HIS CHARACTER WE ARE IN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF IT
INDEED I HAVE SIR WAS HER ANSWER SHE IS A GREAT DEAL TOO ILL TO BE MOVED MISTER JONES SAYS WE MUST NOT THINK OF MOVING HER WE MUST TRESPASS A LITTLE LONGER ON YOUR KINDNESS
INDEED MAMMA YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID ELIZABETH BLUSHING FOR HER MOTHER YOU QUITE MISTOOK MISTER DARCY HE ONLY MEANT THAT THERE WAS NOT SUCH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE TO BE MET WITH IN THE COUNTRY AS IN THE TOWN
I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE CONTINUED BINGLEY IMMEDIATELY THAT YOU WERE A STUDIER OF CHARACTER IT MUST BE AN AMUSING STUDY
THE SISTERS DESCENDED TO THE PARLOR WITH A RETURNING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR BROTHER'S SECURITY AND THEIR OWN HAPPINESS THE FAMILY WERE EARLY IN ASSEMBLING AROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND MISS PEYTON WITH A LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE
HE APPROACHED THE YOUTH WITH AN AIR OF COMIC GRAVITY AND WITH A LOW BOW CONTINUED I AM SORRY FOR THE SEVERE COLD YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD SIR I EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN IN SURPRISE
THERE HAS BEEN MANY A ONE I FANCY OVERCOME IN THE SAME WAY I WONDER WHO FIRST DISCOVERED THE EFFICACY OF POETRY IN DRIVING AWAY LOVE I HAVE BEEN USED TO CONSIDER POETRY AS THE FOOD OF LOVE SAID DARCY
WHERE THE FAMILY WERE ALREADY COLLECTED IN THE GREATEST CONSTERNATION
SO MUCH THE MAN OF FASHION SO GENTEEL AND EASY HE HAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO SAY TO EVERYBODY THAT IS MY IDEA OF GOOD BREEDING AND THOSE PERSONS WHO FANCY THEMSELVES VERY IMPORTANT
ADDED DARCY AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
WHICH WAS SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY OPENED FOR HIS ADMISSION BY CAESAR THE HEAVY TREAD OF THE TROOPER AS HE FOLLOWED THE BLACK TO THE DOOR OF THE PARLOR RANG IN THE EARS OF THE FEMALES AS IT APPROACHED NEARER AND NEARER
OFFENDED BY HIS MANNER OF MENTIONING A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD I ASSURE YOU THERE IS QUITE AS MUCH OF THAT GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AS IN TOWN EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AND DARCY AFTER LOOKING AT HER FOR A MOMENT
YOU WILL NOT THINK OF QUITTING IT IN A HURRY I HOPE THOUGH YOU HAVE BUT A SHORT LEASE WHATEVER I DO IS DONE IN A HURRY REPLIED HE AND THEREFORE IF I SHOULD RESOLVE TO QUIT NETHERFIELD I SHOULD PROBABLY BE OFF IN FIVE MINUTES
HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND LEFT THE APARTMENT THE WHARTONS JUDGING FROM HIS MANNER THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED IN QUEST OF THE OBJECT OF HIS INQUIRIES THEY OBSERVED THE DRAGOON ON
HIS COUNTENANCE GRADUALLY LIGHTING INTO A SMILE OF PLEASURE
AT LENGTH HIS SISTERS WITH TREMBLING HANDS REPLACED HIS ORIGINAL DISGUISE THE INSTRUMENTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY KEPT AT HAND BY CAESAR IN EXPECTATION OF SOME SUDDEN EMERGENCY
WITH ANYBODY WHO DELIGHTED ME SO MUCH SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY
SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN AND THE GOWN WHICH HAD BEEN LET DOWN TO HIDE IT NOT DOING ITS OFFICE YOUR PICTURE MAY BE VERY EXACT LOUISA SAID BINGLEY BUT THIS WAS ALL LOST UPON ME
IN ESKE OR LIDDEL FORDS WERE NONE BUT HE WOULD RIDE THEM ONE BY ONE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIME OR TIDE DECEMBER'S SNOW OR JULY'S PRIDE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIDE OR TIME MOONLESS MIDNIGHT OR MATIN PRIME
THE SISTERS ON HEARING THIS REPEATED THREE OR FOUR TIMES HOW MUCH THEY WERE GRIEVED HOW SHOCKING IT WAS TO HAVE A BAD COLD AND HOW EXCESSIVELY THEY DISLIKED BEING ILL THEMSELVES AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER
AND SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FROM THE TWO ELEGANT LADIES WHO WAITED ON HIS SISTERS IN SPITE OF THIS AMENDMENT HOWEVER SHE REQUESTED TO HAVE A NOTE SENT TO LONGBOURN DESIRING HER MOTHER TO VISIT JANE AND FORM HER OWN JUDGEMENT OF HER SITUATION
TURNED SILENTLY AWAY MISSUS BENNET WHO FANCIED SHE HAD GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY OVER HIM CONTINUED HER TRIUMPH I CANNOT SEE THAT LONDON HAS ANY GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER THE COUNTRY FOR MY PART
I WILL BUY PEMBERLEY ITSELF IF DARCY WILL SELL IT I AM TALKING OF POSSIBILITIES CHARLES UPON MY WORD CAROLINE I SHOULD THINK IT MORE POSSIBLE TO GET PEMBERLEY BY PURCHASE THAN BY IMITATION
BUT PEOPLE THEMSELVES ALTER SO MUCH
HAPPY AND FORTUNATE WERE THE TIMES WHEN THAT MOST DARING KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS SENT INTO THE WORLD
THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
BUT ON THE CURATE ADDRESSING SOME FURTHER WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT TO HER SIGHING DEEPLY SHE BROKE SILENCE AND SAID SINCE THE SOLITUDE OF THESE MOUNTAINS HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL ME AND THE ESCAPE OF MY DISHEVELLED TRESSES WILL NOT ALLOW MY TONGUE TO DEAL IN FALSEHOODS
BE THE ONLY SCRUPLE YOU FEEL FAIREST DOROTHEA FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS UNHAPPY BEING SEE HERE I GIVE YOU MY HAND TO BE YOURS AND LET HEAVEN
AFTER AN EFFORT TO RESTRAIN SOME TEARS THAT CAME TO HER EYES IN A CLEAR AND STEADY VOICE BEGAN HER STORY THUS
HER DELICATE FEET BEING UNABLE TO BEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF THE STONES SEEING WHICH THE THREE HASTENED TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE ADDRESSING HER FIRST SAID STAY SENORA WHOEVER YOU MAY BE FOR THOSE WHOM YOU SEE HERE ONLY DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
HAST THOU HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE TANNER GRIMLY HOLDING HIS STAFF ALOFT AY MARRY AND MORE THAN ENOUGH AND THOU DOST OWN THAT I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO YEA TRULY AND A MURRAIN SEIZE THEE
WHILE I WEARIED MYSELF WITH WATCHING FOR ONE
AND UNSEEN AS I THOUGHT BY ANY EXCEPT THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE FOR WHEN I WENT TO MASS IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I WAS SO CLOSELY ATTENDED BY MY MOTHER AND THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND
I HAVE MY SELF RESPECT AS MUCH AS YOU A LORD AND GENTLEMAN WITH ME YOUR VIOLENCE WILL BE TO NO PURPOSE YOUR WEALTH WILL HAVE NO WEIGHT YOUR WORDS WILL HAVE NO POWER TO DECEIVE ME NOR YOUR SIGHS OR TEARS TO SOFTEN ME
WHO WAS INDEED THE ONE WHO HAD ADMITTED HIM GAINED THE STREET BEFORE DAYBREAK BUT ON TAKING LEAVE OF ME HE TOLD ME THOUGH NOT WITH AS MUCH EARNESTNESS AND FERVOUR AS WHEN HE CAME THAT I MIGHT REST ASSURED OF HIS FAITH AND OF THE SANCTITY AND SINCERITY OF HIS OATHS
AND TAKING HIS STOUT PIKESTAFF IN HIS HAND HE SET FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY ONCE MORE AS THOUGH HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN THE GOOD TOWN OF BLYTH THERE LIVED A STOUT TANNER CELEBRATED FAR AND NEAR FOR FEATS OF STRENGTH AND MANY TOUGH BOUTS AT WRESTLING AND THE QUARTERSTAFF
PASSED THROUGH MY MIND IN A MOMENT BUT THE OATHS OF DON FERNANDO THE WITNESSES HE APPEALED TO THE TEARS HE SHED AND LASTLY THE CHARMS OF HIS PERSON AND HIS HIGH BRED GRACE WHICH ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH SIGNS OF GENUINE LOVE
AND THAT ON THE BRIDEGROOM APPROACHING TO UNLACE THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS TO GIVE HER AIR
I AND MY FRIENDS DO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR GOOD SOVEREIGN'S DEER I CARE NOT WHO THOU ART ANSWERED THE BOLD TANNER AND UNLESS THOU HAST MANY MORE OF THY KIND BY THEE THOU CANST NEVER MAKE ARTHUR A BLAND CRY A MERCY
BUT ALSO OF THE TALES AND EPISODES CONTAINED IN IT WHICH ARE IN A MEASURE NO LESS PLEASING INGENIOUS AND TRUTHFUL THAN THE HISTORY ITSELF WHICH RESUMING ITS THREAD CARDED SPUN AND WOUND RELATES THAT JUST AS THE CURATE WAS GOING TO OFFER CONSOLATION TO CARDENIO
AND IF HER FEET HAD SEEMED LIKE BITS OF CRYSTAL IN THE WATER HER HANDS LOOKED LIKE PIECES OF DRIVEN SNOW AMONG HER LOCKS ALL WHICH INCREASED NOT ONLY THE ADMIRATION OF THE THREE BEHOLDERS BUT THEIR ANXIETY TO LEARN WHO SHE WAS WITH THIS OBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO SHOW THEMSELVES
THERE ARE OTHER INNS THAT THOU KNOWEST YET HEREABOUTS
AND NOW WHAT MAY BE THY NAME HA ARTHUR A BLAND QUOTH ROBIN I HAVE HEARD THY NAME BEFORE GOOD FELLOW THOU DIDST BREAK THE CROWN OF A FRIEND OF MINE AT THE FAIR AT ELY LAST OCTOBER THE FOLK THERE CALL HIM JOCK O NOTTINGHAM WE CALL HIM WILL SCATHELOCK
AND DRIVE ME TO INVENT FALSEHOODS IN REPLY BUT ALL THIS WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO AN END FOR THE TIME CAME WHEN ALL SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE DISREGARDED AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER QUESTION OF HONOUR WHEN MY PATIENCE GAVE WAY AND THE SECRET OF MY HEART BECAME KNOWN ABROAD
AN AFFAIR OF SUCH NOTORIETY IN THE CITY THAT IT WAS THE TALK OF EVERY KNOT OF IDLERS IN THE STREET HE SAID THAT ON THE NIGHT OF DON FERNANDO'S BETROTHAL WITH LUSCINDA AS SOON AS SHE HAD CONSENTED TO BE HIS BRIDE BY SAYING YES SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN FAINTING FIT
YOU HAVE NO NEED TO ATTEMPT A FLIGHT SO HEEDLESS FOR NEITHER CAN YOUR FEET BEAR IT NOR WE ALLOW IT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND BEWILDERED SHE MADE NO REPLY TO THESE WORDS THEY HOWEVER CAME TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE TAKING HER HAND WENT ON TO SAY
THIS BEING SO I SAY I THANK YOU SIRS FOR THE OFFER YOU HAVE MADE ME WHICH PLACES ME UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST YOU HAVE MADE OF ME THOUGH I FEAR THE ACCOUNT I SHALL GIVE YOU OF MY MISFORTUNES WILL EXCITE IN YOU AS MUCH CONCERN AS COMPASSION
TO LEAD HIM TO RECOGNISE HIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORMER ONE AND REFLECT THAT AS A CHRISTIAN HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER HIS SOUL ABOVE ALL HUMAN OBJECTS ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND AND I STROVE TO COMFORT MYSELF WITHOUT COMFORT
FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER SON OF THE DUKE I TOLD OF THE MOMENT THE SPEAKER MENTIONED THE NAME OF DON FERNANDO
AND ONE OF HIS VASSALS I TOLD HIM NOT TO LET MY BEAUTY SUCH AS IT WAS BLIND HIM
AND AS THE SAYING IS OLD RUSTY CHRISTIANS BUT SO RICH THAT BY THEIR WEALTH AND FREE HANDED WAY OF LIFE THEY ARE COMING BY DEGREES TO BE CONSIDERED GENTLEFOLK BY BIRTH AND EVEN BY POSITION
LOOKING UP INTO THE BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH BRIGHT CLOUDS WERE SAILING LIKE SILVER BOATS AND SWALLOWS SKIMMING IN CIRCLING FLIGHT QUOTH HE
IF NOT TO RELIEVE YOUR DISTRESS AT LEAST TO OFFER YOU COMFORT FOR NO DISTRESS SO LONG AS LIFE LASTS CAN BE SO OPPRESSIVE OR REACH SUCH A HEIGHT AS TO MAKE THE SUFFERER REFUSE TO LISTEN TO COMFORT OFFERED WITH GOOD INTENTION AND SO SENORA
THE LONG AUBURN TRESSES NOT ONLY COVERED HER SHOULDERS BUT SUCH WAS THEIR LENGTH AND ABUNDANCE CONCEALED HER ALL ROUND BENEATH THEIR MASSES SO THAT EXCEPT THE FEET NOTHING OF HER FORM WAS VISIBLE SHE NOW USED HER HANDS AS A COMB
THERE TO SELL A HALFSCORE OF TANNED COWHIDES AT THE DAWN OF THE SAME DAY THAT LITTLE JOHN LEFT THE INN HE STARTED FROM NOTTINGHAM HOMEWARD FOR BLYTH HIS WAY LED ALL IN THE DEWY MORN PAST THE VERGE OF SHERWOOD FOREST WHERE THE BIRDS WERE WELCOMING THE LOVELY DAY WITH A GREAT AND MERRY JUBILEE
HA QUOTH ROBIN TO HIMSELF HERE IS MERRY SPORT AFOOT NOW I WOULD GIVE THREE GOLDEN ANGELS FROM MY OWN POCKET IF YON STOUT FELLOW WOULD GIVE LITTLE JOHN A RIGHT SOUND DRUBBING IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO SEE HIM WELL THUMPED FOR HAVING FAILED IN MY BIDDING
BY ACIDITY OR ACERBITY AND SOMETIMES BY WISDOM FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE MORE NOTABLE EPIGRAMS OF THE LEARNED AND INGENIOUS DOCTOR JAMRACH HOLOBOM WE KNOW BETTER THE NEEDS OF OURSELVES THAN OF OTHERS
TERRESTRIAN THERE IS NO PRECEDENT FOR ANY SUCH COURSE LUNARIAN PRECEDENT WHAT IS THAT TERRESTRIAN
AND HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH ME IT WAS MY LIVER THAT WAS OUT OF ORDER I KNEW IT WAS MY LIVER THAT WAS OUT OF ORDER BECAUSE I HAD JUST BEEN READING A PATENT LIVER PILL CIRCULAR
AND EVEN IF I HAD IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME SOMEHOW LITTLE DREAM GIRLS ARE NOT SATISFYING AFTER A REAL FRIEND DIANA AND I HAD SUCH AN AFFECTING FAREWELL DOWN BY THE SPRING IT WILL BE SACRED IN MY MEMORY FOREVER
AND DETERMINED TO DO WITHOUT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE GOUT IN ITS MOST MALIGNANT STAGE IT WOULD APPEAR HAD SEIZED ME WITHOUT MY BEING AWARE OF IT AND ZYMOSIS I HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN SUFFERING WITH FROM BOYHOOD
AND I PUT IT IN MY POCKET AND WENT OUT I DID NOT OPEN IT
ASTONISHMENT AND HOPE STRUGGLING IN HER EXPRESSIVE EYES BUT THE HOPE FADED WHEN SHE SAW DIANA'S DEJECTED COUNTENANCE YOUR MOTHER HASN'T RELENTED SHE GASPED DIANA SHOOK HER HEAD MOURNFULLY NO AND OH ANNE
AND AT INTERVALS FROM BEHIND THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE IS HEARD THE VOICE OF THE FOREMAN DEMANDING THREE INCHES OF WIT
AND AFTER THAT TAKE THEIR DIPLOMA THEN I WONDERED HOW LONG I HAD TO LIVE
AND FORBIDDING CHRIST TO SAVE HIM
USEFUL PRESCRIPTIONS CURE FOR LIVER COMPLAINT IN CHILDREN
THAT MY LIFE WAS PRESERVED AND IS STILL GOING ON IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE GOING BACK TO THE LIVER PILL CIRCULAR I HAD THE SYMPTOMS BEYOND ALL MISTAKE THE CHIEF AMONG THEM BEING A GENERAL DISINCLINATION TO WORK OF ANY KIND
BUT AS THE CAESAR'S PAGEANT SHORN OF BRUTUS BUST DID BUT OF ROME'S BEST SON REMIND HER MORE SO THE MARKED ABSENCE OF ANY TRIBUTE OR RECOGNITION FROM DIANA BARRY WHO WAS SITTING WITH GERTIE PYE EMBITTERED
WHY THIS INVIDIOUS RESERVATION AFTER A WHILE HOWEVER LESS GRASPING FEELINGS PREVAILED I REFLECTED THAT I HAD EVERY OTHER KNOWN MALADY IN THE PHARMACOLOGY AND I GREW LESS SELFISH
KISSED THE BOOKMARK AND DISPATCHED A PROMPT REPLY BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCHOOL MY OWN DARLING DIANA OF COURSE I AM NOT CROSS AT YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO OBEY YOUR MOTHER OUR SPIRITS CAN COMMUNE
EXPOSTULATION
AND HER LIPS PRIMMED UP INTO A LINE OF DETERMINATION I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IS ALL THERE IS LEFT IN LIFE FOR ME NOW THAT MY FRIEND HAS BEEN RUTHLESSLY TORN FROM ME IN SCHOOL I CAN LOOK AT HER AND MUSE OVER DAYS DEPARTED
PETULANTLY UTTERING HIS MIND AT THE TAIL OF A DOG THEN STRAIGHTWAY MURMURS A MILD MELODIOUS LAY SOFT AS THE COOING OF A DONKEY INTONING ITS PRAYER TO THE EVENING STAR MASTER OF MYSTERIES AND LORD OF LAW
WISE PIOUS HUMBLE AND ALL THAT WHO SHOWED US LIFE AS ALL SHOULD LIVE IT LET THAT BE SAID AND GOD FORGIVE IT
THERE WERE NO MORE DISEASES AFTER ZYMOSIS SO I CONCLUDED THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THE MATTER WITH ME I SAT AND PONDERED
BUT IS PLACABLE WITH AN OBOLUS A SEVERELY VIRTUOUS CENSOR BUT SO CHARITABLE WITHAL
AND A SMALL PARCEL WERE PASSED ACROSS TO ANNE DEAR ANNE RAN THE FORMER MOTHER SAYS I'M NOT TO PLAY WITH YOU OR TALK TO YOU EVEN IN SCHOOL IT ISN'T MY FAULT AND DON'T BE CROSS AT ME BECAUSE I LOVE YOU AS MUCH AS EVER
WOMEN IN LOVE ARE LESS ASHAMED THAN MEN THEY HAVE LESS TO BE ASHAMED OF WHILE YOUR FRIEND HOLDS YOU AFFECTIONATELY BY BOTH YOUR HANDS YOU ARE SAFE FOR YOU CAN WATCH BOTH HIS EPITAPH
THOSE SIMPLE OLD FASHIONED REMEDIES ARE SOMETIMES MORE EFFICACIOUS THAN ALL THE DISPENSARY STUFF WE SAT THERE FOR HALF AN HOUR DESCRIBING TO EACH OTHER OUR MALADIES I EXPLAINED TO GEORGE AND WILLIAM HARRIS HOW I FELT WHEN I GOT UP IN THE MORNING
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN A NEW INTEREST IN LIFE THE NEXT AFTERNOON ANNE BENDING OVER HER PATCHWORK AT THE KITCHEN WINDOW HAPPENED TO GLANCE OUT AND BEHELD DIANA DOWN BY THE DRYAD'S BUBBLE BECKONING MYSTERIOUSLY
HUCKLE EXECUTIVE
A PARTIAL DEFINITION OF THE WORD EVERLASTING
OH DIANA WILL YOU PROMISE FAITHFULLY NEVER TO FORGET ME THE FRIEND OF YOUR YOUTH NO MATTER WHAT DEARER FRIENDS MAY CARESS THEE INDEED I WILL SOBBED DIANA AND I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER BOSOM FRIEND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
THEN HE OPENED ME AND LOOKED DOWN ME AND CLUTCHED HOLD OF MY WRIST AND THEN HE HIT ME OVER THE CHEST WHEN I WASN'T EXPECTING IT A COWARDLY THING TO DO I CALL IT AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS BUTTED ME WITH THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AFTER THAT
THAN A WHOLE BOX OF PILLS DOES NOW
ANNE BEAT HIM BY FIVE BUT HER TRIUMPH WAS MARRED BY THE FACT THAT GILBERT CONGRATULATED HER HEARTILY BEFORE THE WHOLE SCHOOL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO MUCH SWEETER TO HER IF HE HAD FELT THE STING OF HIS DEFEAT
SHE IS JUST DULL AND POKY AND NEVER SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD TIME BUT I FEEL SO DEPRESSED THAT PERHAPS IT WILL COME EASY TO ME NOW I'M GOING ROUND BY THE ROAD I COULDN'T BEAR TO GO BY THE BIRCH PATH ALL ALONE I SHOULD WEEP
FOUND AS I EXPECTED THAT I HAD THAT TOO BEGAN TO GET INTERESTED IN MY CASE AND DETERMINED TO SIFT IT TO THE BOTTOM AND SO STARTED ALPHABETICALLY
WHAT A DOCTOR WANTS I SAID IS PRACTICE HE SHALL HAVE ME HE WILL GET MORE PRACTICE OUT OF ME THAN OUT OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED OF YOUR ORDINARY COMMONPLACE PATIENTS WITH ONLY ONE OR TWO DISEASES EACH SO I WENT STRAIGHT UP AND SAW HIM AND HE SAID WELL
AND THE QUESTION IS STILL UNSETTLED EULOGY
YOU EXPECTED TO SEE HER COLOSSAL FIGURE LOOM THROUGH THAT REEKING BLUE CLOUD OF SMOKE FROM FRYING FAT JUST AS YOU EXPECT THE PALISADES TO APPEAR THROUGH A DRIFTING HUDSON RIVER FOG
BUT THESE TWO WERE OF NO CONSEQUENCE EXCEPT PERHAPS FOR THE GUIDING OF THE MACHINE AND THE PAYING FOR IT AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S SIDE SAT A YOUNG LADY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS
I'D LIKE TO BE ONE OF THOSE BOBBIES ON HORSEBACK THAT WOULD BE ABOUT THE TICKET BESIDES IT'S THE ONLY THING I COULD DO I CAN RIDE A LITTLE AND THE FRESH AIR SUITS ME THINK YOU COULD LAND THAT FOR ME
LOOMED UP BIG AND WHITE AND PINK AND AWFUL AS MOUNT SAINT ELIAS WITH A SMILE LIKE DAY BREAKING IN A GULCH AND THE KLONDIKER THREW DOWN HIS PELTS AND NUGGETS AS DROSS AND LET HIS JAW FALL HALF WAY AND STARED AT HER
THE PAINTER WAS A YOUNG SCRUB OUT OF THE WEST NAMED KRAFT WHO HAD A FAVOURITE FOOD AND A PET THEORY HIS PABULUM WAS AN UNQUENCHABLE BELIEF IN THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE
READY TO MELT IN THE CRUCIBLE OF HER IRE A LITTLE MORE GOLD PLATING FROM THE WROUGHT STEEL CHAINS OF MATRIMONY FOR THESE THINGS CUPID WILL HAVE TO ANSWER WHEN HE STANDS AT THE BAR OF JUSTICE WITH HIS VICTIMS FROM THE FROGMORE FLATS
HIS HOME WAS DISMANTLED
THAT WOULD HAVE DRAWN SAINT PYRITES FROM HIS IRON PILLAR OR WHATEVER THE ALLUSION IS AND OF THE LADY'S SMILE AND LOOK A LITTLE FRIGHTENED BUT A LOOK THAT WITH THE EVER COWARD HEART OF A TRUE LOVER HE COULD NOT YET CONSTRUE
HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR ALL HIS NEGLECT WHAT WAS LIFE WITHOUT HER THE DOOR OPENED KATY WALKED IN CARRYING A LITTLE HAND SATCHEL JOHN STARED AT HER STUPIDLY MY I'M GLAD TO GET BACK SAID KATY
BEARING THE CHALICE THAT HELD THE DREGS OF HIS JOY HE MIGHT PLAY POOL AT MC CLOSKEY'S WITH HIS ROISTERING FRIENDS UNTIL AURORA DIMMED THE ELECTRIC BULBS IF HE CHOSE
AND YET SOMEHOW I COULD NEVER THINK OF HER AS EXISTING OUTSIDE OF CYPHER'S THERE NATURE HAD PLACED HER AND SHE HAD TAKEN ROOT AND GROWN MIGHTILY
NO TROUBLE AT ALL SAID REMSEN I KNOW A LOT OF MEN WHO HAVE BANKS AND STORES AND THINGS DOWNTOWN ANY PARTICULAR LINE YOU FANCY YES SAID O'ROON WITH A LOOK OF INTEREST I TOOK A WALK IN YOUR CENTRAL PARK THIS MORNING
SLOWLY BECAUSE IN THE LEXICON OF HIS DAILY LIFE THERE WAS NO SUCH WORD AS PERHAPS THERE ARE NO SURPRISES AWAITING A MAN WHO HAS BEEN MARRIED TWO YEARS AND LIVES IN A FLAT AS HE WALKED
O'ROON LOOKED SEEDY AND OUT OF LUCK AND PERFECTLY CONTENTED BUT IT SEEMED THAT HIS CONTENT WAS ONLY APPARENT GET ME A JOB REMSEN HE SAID I'VE JUST HANDED A BARBER MY LAST SHILLING
AND MANY WOMEN WHO AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE APPEAR TO RESEMBLE POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS YET HE HOPED TO SEE HER AGAIN FOR EACH ONE FANCIES THAT HIS ROMANCE HAS ITS OWN TUTELARY GUARDIAN AND DIVINITY
SPEAK I INTERRUPTED MUCH PERTURBED YOU DO NOT THINK THAT MILLY WILL BEGIN TO LACE ONE DAY CONCLUDED KRAFT SOLEMNLY THERE WILL COME TO CYPHER'S FOR A PLATE OF BEANS A MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN FROM WISCONSIN
ONE OF THE TROOPERS WAS A WELL SET UP AFFABLE COOL YOUNG MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF O'ROON TO THIS YOUNG MAN REMSEN TOOK AN ESPECIAL LIKING
THERE AMID THE STEAM OF VEGETABLES AND THE VAPOURS OF ACRES OF HAM AND THE CRASH OF CROCKERY THE CLATTER OF STEEL THE SCREAMING OF SHORT ORDERS THE CRIES OF THE HUNGERING AND ALL THE HORRID TUMULT OF FEEDING MAN
OF RUSSIANS AND JAPS SLAUGHTERED BY THE DEADLY LINOTYPE FOR DINNER THERE WOULD BE POT ROAST A SALAD FLAVORED WITH A DRESSING WARRANTED NOT TO CRACK OR INJURE THE LEATHER STEWED RHUBARB
YES THERE WAS THE CITY ROARING OUTSIDE FOR JOHN PERKINS TO COME DANCE IN THE TRAIN OF MOMUS AND AT MC CLOSKEY'S THE BOYS WERE KNOCKING THE BALLS IDLY INTO THE POCKETS AGAINST THE HOUR FOR THE NIGHTLY GAME BUT NO PRIMROSE WAY
THE COTTON HAS ITS BOLLWORM THE CHORUS GIRL HAS HER PITTSBURGER THE SUMMER BOARDER HAS HIS POISON IVY THE HERO HAS HIS CARNEGIE MEDAL ART HAS ITS MORGAN THE ROSE HAS ITS
AND SPEECHES AND THE SPANIARD WAS BEARDED AGAIN IN RECAPITULATION AND WHEN DAYLIGHT THREATENED THEM THE SURVIVORS PREPARED TO DEPART BUT SOME REMAINED UPON THE BATTLEFIELD ONE OF THESE WAS TROOPER O'ROON WHO WAS NOT SEASONED TO POTENT LIQUIDS
BUT HE KNEW THAT WOULD BE THE LAST MEANS OF ATTRACTING THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO RIDE IN MOTOR CARS SLOWLY THE AUTO PASSED AND IF WE PLACE THE POETS ABOVE THE AUTOISTS CARRIED THE HEART OF REMSEN WITH IT
JOHN PERKINS YOU'RE THE WORST KIND OF A SHINE I'M GOING TO MAKE IT UP FOR THE LITTLE GIRL I'LL TAKE HER OUT AND LET HER SEE SOME AMUSEMENT AND I'LL CUT OUT THE MC CLOSKEY GANG RIGHT FROM THIS MINUTE
BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF THE VERY HAND OF DEATH HAD POINTED A FINGER AT HIS SECURE AND UNEVENTFUL HOME JOHN DRAGGED THE COLD MUTTON FROM THE ICE BOX
WITH A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR A WEEK CONTRACT THEN THE GENT AT THE WINDOW ACROSS THE AIR SHAFT WOULD GET OUT HIS FLUTE THE NIGHTLY GAS LEAK WOULD STEAL FORTH TO FROLIC IN THE HIGHWAYS THE DUMBWAITER WOULD SLIP OFF ITS TROLLEY
DON'T MENTION IT HE SAID STOLIDLY WE POLICEMEN ARE PAID TO DO THESE THINGS IT'S OUR DUTY AND HE RODE AWAY
WITH THE FREEDOM OF THE CAMPS HE ASSAULTED OUR EARS AND CLAIMED THE FELLOWSHIP OF MEN LOST IN THE WILDS OF A HASH HOUSE WE EMBRACED HIM AS A SPECIMEN AND IN THREE MINUTES WE HAD ALL BUT DIED FOR ONE ANOTHER AS FRIENDS
ONE DAY A WELL SET UP AFFABLE COOL YOUNG MAN DISTURBED HIM AT HIS CLUB AND HE AND O'ROON WERE SOON POUNDING EACH OTHER AND EXCHANGING OPPROBRIOUS EPITHETS AFTER THE MANNER OF LONG LOST FRIENDS
J WOLFE TO MISSUS WOLFE AT HER HOUSE IN GREENWICH KENT WOLFE'S VERY GOOD STATE OF HEALTH WAS NOT LIKELY TO CONTINUE SO EITHER IN CAMP OR ON BOARD SHIP
AND THAT THERE ISN'T ONE OF THEM THAT DOESN'T SOMETIMES DREAM IN THE DULL QUIET OF THE LONG EVENING HERE IN THE CLUB THAT SOME DAY HE WILL GO BACK AND SEE THE PLACE THEY ALL DO ONLY THEY'RE HALF ASHAMED TO OWN IT
HOME MEANS THAT BIG RED SANDSTONE HOUSE OF YOURS IN THE COSTLIER PART OF THE CITY HOME MEANS IN A WAY THIS MAUSOLEUM CLUB WHERE YOU SOMETIMES TALK WITH ME
ARE OF AN OLD AND HONOURABLE LINE MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO THEIR FOREFATHERS LIVED IN ENGLAND AND LATER ON IN WALES LATER STILL IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY BEFORE AMERICA WAS DISCOVERED THEY WERE LIVING IN IRELAND WOLFE'S FATHER HOWEVER
AND SMILED GRIMLY INTO OLAF'S BEARDED FACE THEN WE CAN COUNT ON THAT THING COMING ACROSS THE NECK OF SEA FROM THE GULF OF ANADYR HE FINISHED AND IF IT EVER DOES COME THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES WILL AT LAST
TWO OTHER HOUSES IN THE LITTLE COUNTRY TOWN OF WESTERHAM ARE FULL OF MEMORIES OF WOLFE ONE OF THESE WAS HIS FATHER'S A HOUSE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS BORN
THUNDERING AND POUNDING TOWARDS THE NORTH WITH HEMLOCK SPARKS POURING OUT INTO THE DARKNESS FROM THE FUNNEL OF IT OF COURSE YOU CAN'T TELL IT JUST AT FIRST ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE CROWDING INTO IT WITH GOLF CLUBS AND WEARING KNICKERBOCKERS AND FLAT CAPS WOULD DECEIVE ANYBODY
TWICE HE HAD TRIED IT SINCE HIS OLD COMRADE HAD DIED AND TWICE HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN OUT THE NEXT TIME HE WOULD KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT AND HE INVITED ALAN TO GO WITH HIM THERE WAS A THRILL IN THIS TALK OF A LAND SO NEAR
THE LANKY RED HAIRED BOY OF THIRTEEN AND A HALF TOOK HIS SEAT ON THE PORTSMOUTH COACH BESIDE HIS FATHER THE VETERAN SOLDIER OF FIFTY FIVE HIS MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF MUCH TOO FINE A SPIRIT TO GRUDGE ANYTHING FOR THE SERVICE OF HER COUNTRY
WHERE HE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AT SWINDEN'S HERE HE WORKED QUIETLY ENOUGH TILL JUST BEFORE HE ENTERED ON HIS TEENS THEN THE LONG PENT RAGE OF ENGLAND SUDDENLY BURST IN WAR WITH SPAIN THE PEOPLE WENT WILD WHEN THE BRITISH FLEET TOOK PORTO BELLO
NOR HAS THE MARTIAL SPIRIT DESERTED THE DESCENDANTS OF THE WOLFES IN THE GENERATION NOW ALIVE THEY ARE SOLDIERS STILL THE PRESENT HEAD OF THE FAMILY WHO REPRESENTED IT AT THE CELEBRATION OF THE TERCENTENARY OF THE FOUNDING OF QUEBEC
BY REASON I WAS AT CAMP TO SEE THE REGIMENTS OFF TO GO ON BOARD AND WAS TOO LATE FOR THE POST BUT AM VERY SORRY DEAR MAMMA THAT YOU DOUBT MY LOVE WHICH I'M SURE IS AS SINCERE AS EVER ANY SON'S WAS TO HIS MOTHER
DON'T TELL ME THAT THE SPEED IS ONLY TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS
BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING EXCEPTIONALLY ANXIOUS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF DISEASE FOR A SICKLY BOY IN A FAR OFF LAND OF PESTILENCE AND FEVER SHE HAD WRITTEN TO HIM THE VERY DAY HE LEFT
THAT NIGHT IN OLAF'S CABIN ALAN PUT HIMSELF BACK ON THE OLD TRACK AGAIN HE MADE NO EFFORT TO MINIMIZE THE TRAGEDY THAT HAD COME INTO HIS LIFE AND HE KNEW ITS EFFECT UPON HIM WOULD NEVER BE WIPED AWAY
IT'S GOD'S OWN COUNTRY WE HAVE NORTH OF FIFTY EIGHT OLAF AND WE HAVE TEN TIMES THE WEALTH OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN CARE FOR A MILLION PEOPLE EASILY BUT BAD POLITICS AND BAD JUDGMENT BOTH HERE IN ALASKA AND AT WASHINGTON
MARIPOSA PEOPLE OH YES THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF THEM ON THE TRAIN EVERY DAY BUT OF COURSE YOU HARDLY RECOGNIZE THEM WHILE THE TRAIN IS STILL PASSING THROUGH THE SUBURBS
FACE THE TRAGIC REALIZATION OF WHAT ALASKA COULD HAVE MEANT TO THE NATION
A LONG PEACE HAD MADE THE COUNTRY INDIFFERENT TO THE WELFARE OF THE ARMY AND NAVY NOW MEN WERE SUDDENLY BEING MASSED TOGETHER IN CAMPS AND FLEETS AS IF ON PURPOSE TO BREED DISEASE SANITATION ON A LARGE SCALE NEVER HAVING BEEN PRACTISED IN PEACE
AND ARE RISING UP TO THE HIGHER GROUND OF THE COUNTRY OF THE PINES AND THE LAKES LOOK FROM THE WINDOW AS YOU GO THE CITY IS FAR BEHIND NOW
BUT NO WONDER THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE FIVE O'CLOCK TRAIN FOR MARIPOSA VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT HUNDREDS OF THEM KNOW THAT THERE IS A TRAIN THAT GOES OUT AT FIVE O'CLOCK BUT THEY MISTAKE IT EVER SO MANY OF THEM THINK IT'S JUST A SUBURBAN TRAIN
AND THE DUKE OF CUMBERLAND CAME DOWN TO REVIEW THEM
THAT THE TRAIN WAS THERE EVERY AFTERNOON PUFFING UP STEAM IN THE CITY STATION AND THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BOARDED IT ANY DAY AND GONE HOME NO NOT HOME OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T CALL IT HOME NOW
IT MAY BE A GENERATION FROM NOW MAYBE A CENTURY BUT IT'S COMING SURE AS GOD MAKES LIGHT IF WE LET ALASKA GO DOWN AND OUT AND MY WAY OF PREVENTING IT IS DIFFERENT FROM YOURS HE STARED INTO THE FIRE
ASK YOUR NEIGHBOUR THERE AT THE NEXT TABLE WHETHER THE PARTRIDGE THAT THEY SOMETIMES SERVE TO YOU HERE CAN BE COMPARED FOR A MOMENT TO THE BIRDS THAT HE AND YOU OR HE AND SOME ONE ELSE USED TO SHOOT AS BOYS IN THE SPRUCE THICKETS ALONG THE LAKE
A SPANISH PORT IN CENTRAL AMERICA THE NEWS WAS CRIED THROUGH THE STREETS ALL NIGHT THE NOISE OF BATTLE SEEMED TO BE SOUNDING ALL ROUND SWINDEN'S SCHOOL WHERE MOST OF THE BOYS BELONGED TO NAVAL AND MILITARY FAMILIES
BUT SINCE SUCH TREATMENT GIVES A TOTALLY FALSE IDEA OF HIS ACHIEVEMENT THIS LITTLE SKETCH DRAWN STRAIGHT FROM ORIGINAL SOURCES TRIES TO SHOW HIM AS HE REALLY WAS A CO WORKER WITH THE BRITISH FLEET IN A WAR BASED ENTIRELY ON NAVAL STRATEGY
AND BUSINESSLIKE INTENTION OF SIFTING THE MATTER TO THE BOTTOM THAT HE MIGHT DISPROVE HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY AND SET HIMSELF RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES IN SELF DEFENSE HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ROSSLAND AN OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK DOWN WITH COLD FACTS
THE SOLDIER WHO WON CANADA FOR ENGLAND IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY NINE SAT UNDER THE ARMS OF THE KING IN WHOSE SERVICE THE SAILOR CABOT HOISTED THE FLAG OF ENGLAND OVER CANADIAN SOIL IN FOURTEEN NINETY SEVEN
BUT OF COURSE HOME WOULD HARDLY BE THE WORD YOU WOULD APPLY TO THE LITTLE TOWN UNLESS PERHAPS LATE AT NIGHT WHEN YOU'D BEEN SITTING READING IN A QUIET CORNER SOMEWHERE SUCH A BOOK AS THE PRESENT ONE NATURALLY YOU DON'T KNOW OF THE MARIPOSA TRAIN NOW
ALWAYS MESSES WITH HER FOOD ALWAYS PLAYS WITH HER POTATOES MEAT AND GRAVY AND TOMATOES
OF A GOOP WHOSE NAME WAS EZRA HECHT OF COURSE HE WOULD REFUSE TO HEED OR MIND HIS MOTHER YES INDEED OF COURSE HE WOULD OF COURSE HE DID BUT YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU ARE BID
BUT THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM THAT IF HE DIDN'T GO AWAY HE WOULD PUNCH HIM ON THE NOSE JOHN DOLITTLE WAS A STRONG MAN THOUGH HE WASN'T VERY TALL
AND GRAVELY FROM HIS PRAYER BOOK READS
WHEN THEY PERCEIVE THE ROC GIGANTIC WE NEED BUT WATCH THEI R OC UPATION AND SEEK NO OTHER EXPLANATION THE LARK
SWEEPING HIS TAIL OVER THE FLOOR WITH A RAG TIED ONTO IT FOR A BROOM AFTER A LITTLE THEY GOT TO DO THE WORK SO WELL THAT THE DOCTOR SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER HAD HIS HOUSE KEPT SO TIDY OR SO CLEAN BEFORE IN THIS WAY
IT ISN'T AN ALLIGATOR SAID THE DOCTOR IT'S A CROCODILE I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL IT SAID HIS SISTER IT'S A NASTY THING TO FIND UNDER THE BED I WON'T HAVE IT IN THE HOUSE
OF COURSE AT FIRST THEY ALL FOUND THEIR NEW JOBS VERY HARD TO DO ALL EXCEPT CHEE CHEE WHO HAD HANDS AND COULD DO THINGS LIKE A MAN BUT THEY SOON GOT USED TO IT AND THEY USED TO THINK IT GREAT FUN TO WATCH JIP THE DOG
THE OLD LADIES GREW AFRAID TO SEND THEIR LAP DOGS TO DOCTOR DOLITTLE BECAUSE OF THE CROCODILE AND THE FARMERS WOULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD NOT EAT THE LAMBS AND SICK CALVES THEY BROUGHT TO BE CURED
SO THEY COULD HAVE A BIG FIRE IN THE KITCHEN MOST OF THE VEGETABLES IN THE GARDEN WERE GONE AND THE REST WERE COVERED WITH SNOW
A THING WHICH EVERYONE SHOULD LEARN OBSERVE THE TERN UP IN THE AIR SEE HOW HE TURNS AND NOW COMPARE HIM WITH THIS INERT VEGETABLE WHO THUS TO TURN IS QUITE UNABLE FOR HE IS ROOTED TO THE SPOT WHILE AS WE SEE THE TERN IS NOT
FREDDIE FISHER FAIRLY FUSSED WHEN HE CAME TO EAT HIS CRUST OFTEN ON THE FLOOR HE'D THROW IT HOPING MOTHER WOULDN'T KNOW IT GOOPS ALL HATE TO EAT THE CRUST IF YOU'RE TOLD TO THEN YOU MUST
AND SO IT SHOULD DIRECT YOUR WAY TO GOOD BEHAVIOR EVERY DAY THE CHILDREN OF WHOSE FAULTS I TELL
THOUGH CORALIE WAS SMALL AND SWEET
THE OWL TOO TOO WAS TO KEEP THE ACCOUNTS AND THE PIG WAS TO DO THE GARDENING THEY MADE POLYNESIA THE PARROT HOUSEKEEPER AND LAUNDRESS BECAUSE SHE WAS THE OLDEST
IS CLASSIFIED A BIRD OF PREY IBISCUS WE HAVE HEARD RELATED THE CRIMSON EYE IS DESIGNATED THEIR DIFFERENCE IS PLAIN INDEED THE FLOWER IS RED THE BIRD CAN READ THE BUTTER BALL
BUT HE HAS PROMISED ME THE DOCTOR ANSWERED THAT HE WILL NOT BITE ANY ONE HE DOESN'T LIKE THE CIRCUS AND I HAVEN'T THE MONEY TO SEND HIM BACK TO AFRICA WHERE HE COMES FROM HE MINDS HIS OWN BUSINESS AND ON THE WHOLE IS VERY WELL BEHAVED
NOW THE FARMERS AND THE OLD LADIES ARE AFRAID TO SEND THEIR ANIMALS TO YOU JUST AS WE WERE BEGINNING TO BE WELL OFF AGAIN NOW WE SHALL BE RUINED ENTIRELY THIS IS THE LAST STRAW I WILL NO LONGER BE HOUSEKEEPER FOR YOU IF YOU DON'T SEND AWAY THAT ALLIGATOR
THE COWSLIP HAS BEEN MUCH ADMIRED ALTHO ITS PROPER NAME WE'RE TOLD IS REALLY THE MARSH MARIGOLD THE COW BIRD PICTURE I SUSPECT IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT WE MAKE SUCH ERRORS NOW AND THEN A SORT OF COW SLIP OF THE PEN A SPARRER
MONEY IS A NUISANCE HE USED TO SAY WE'D ALL BE MUCH BETTER OFF IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN INVENTED WHAT DOES MONEY MATTER SO LONG AS WE ARE HAPPY BUT SOON THE ANIMALS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO GET WORRIED
I ALWAYS THINK OF SUSIE KLEIN I THINK OF HOW SHE HANGS HER HEAD SHE DOESN'T SPEAK SHE WHINES INSTEAD DON'T WHINE IF YOU DON'T SPEAK RIGHT OUT
WHILE ORCHIDS CAN BE FOUND IN LEGIONS WITHIN THE EQUATORIAL REGIONS THE GRACEFUL ORCHID ON ITS STALK
WHEN JOHN D PELL WANTS SOMETHING DONE D'YOU THINK HE ASKS OF ANYONE OH NO HE ORDERS SOMEONE TO WITH GET MY HAT OR TIE MY SHOE THE GOOPS ALL SAY RUDE THINGS LIKE THESE BUT YOU OF COURSE SAY
LETTING WATER FLOOD THE SINK ANDREW WAS A GOOP I THINK
SHE OFTEN SAID WHAT WASN'T TRUE WHICH IS AN AWFUL THING TO DO BUT WE ARE HONEST YOU AND I WE THINK IT'S WRONG TO TELL A LIE
SO LONG AS THE HENS LAY EGGS AND THE COW GIVES MILK WE CAN HAVE OMELETTES AND JUNKET AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF VEGETABLES LEFT IN THE GARDEN THE WINTER IS STILL A LONG WAY OFF DON'T FUSS THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH SARAH SHE WOULD FUSS
HE IS NOT ALWAYS DOOMED TO BE
FROM MORN TILL NIGHT LIKE ANYTHING THE QUACKING OF THE BUTTER BALL CANNOT BE CALLED A SONG AT ALL
HE WAS POORER THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE WITH ALL THESE MOUTHS TO FILL AND THE HOUSE TO LOOK AFTER AND NO ONE TO DO THE MENDING AND NO MONEY COMING IN TO PAY THE BUTCHER'S BILL THINGS BEGAN TO LOOK VERY DIFFICULT BUT THE DOCTOR DIDN'T WORRY AT ALL
THE OTHER ANIMALS IN THE HOUSE CALLED HIM CHEE CHEE WHICH IS A COMMON WORD IN MONKEY LANGUAGE MEANING GINGER AND ANOTHER TIME
YOU CAN EASILY TELL THEM APART WITHOUT FAIL BY MERELY OBSERVING THE RUE LACKS DE TAIL THE PARROT
MISS GWENDOLYN DE VERE DE WITT
THE CROCODILE WHO HAD A BAD TOOTH ACHE ESCAPED AT NIGHT AND CAME INTO THE DOCTOR'S GARDEN THE DOCTOR TALKED TO HIM IN CROCODILE LANGUAGE AND TOOK HIM INTO THE HOUSE AND MADE HIS TOOTH BETTER BUT WHEN THE CROCODILE SAW WHAT A NICE HOUSE IT WAS
NOT EVERY ONE IS ALWAYS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE A VEGETABLE FOR SOME ARE GUIDED BY TRADITION WHILE OTHERS USE THEIR INTUITION AND EVEN I MAKE NO PRETENSE OF HAVING MORE THAN COMMON SENSE
YOUNG ALEXANDER B MC GIFF
SHE CALLED HER SISTER HORRID NAMES SHE CALLED HER BROTHER NAMES AS WELL SO BAD I WOULDN'T DARE TO TELL IT'S SHOCKING HOW A GOOP WILL ACT
THE WOLVES HOWLED THE SNOW CRACKLED ABOVE THEM FLEW LARGE SCREAMING CROWS BUT HIGHER UP APPEARED THE MOON QUITE LARGE AND BRIGHT
AND NOW IT WORKED MUCH MORE EVIL THAN BEFORE FOR SOME OF THESE PIECES WERE HARDLY SO LARGE AS A GRAIN OF SAND AND THEY FLEW ABOUT IN THE WIDE WORLD AND WHEN THEY GOT INTO PEOPLE'S EYES THERE THEY STAYED
ALICE ASKED VERY MUCH SURPRISED AT HIS TAKING IT SO QUIETLY
AND OUT OF EACH PEEPED A GENTLE FRIENDLY EYE IT WAS THE LITTLE BOY
SAID SHE ONE MORNING KAY HAS NEVER SEEN THEM AND THEN I'LL GO DOWN TO THE RIVER AND ASK THERE IT WAS QUITE EARLY SHE KISSED HER OLD GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS STILL ASLEEP PUT ON HER RED SHOES AND WENT ALONE TO THE RIVER
AND THE GUTTER RAN ALONG THE EXTREME END OF IT THERE WAS TO EACH HOUSE A SMALL WINDOW ONE NEEDED ONLY TO STEP OVER THE GUTTER TO GET FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER THE CHILDREN'S PARENTS HAD LARGE WOODEN BOXES THERE
WHAT A FIGHT WE MIGHT HAVE FOR THE CROWN NOW THE UNICORN SAID
STILL THE LITTLE VEHICLE RUSHED ON WITH THE QUICKNESS OF THE WIND
SAID THE GRANDMOTHER SHE FLIES WHERE THE SWARM HANGS IN THE THICKEST CLUSTERS SHE IS THE LARGEST OF ALL AND SHE CAN NEVER REMAIN QUIETLY ON THE EARTH BUT GOES UP AGAIN INTO THE BLACK CLOUDS
SHE ONLY PRACTISED WITCHCRAFT A LITTLE FOR HER OWN PRIVATE AMUSEMENT AND NOW SHE WANTED VERY MUCH TO KEEP LITTLE GERDA SHE THEREFORE WENT OUT
SAID THE KING HE'S AN ANGLO SAXON MESSENGER AND THOSE ARE ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDES
AND RUN AWAY FROM HER SHE NOW LED GERDA INTO THE FLOWER GARDEN OH WHAT ODOUR AND WHAT LOVELINESS WAS THERE EVERY FLOWER THAT ONE COULD THINK OF AND OF EVERY SEASON STOOD THERE IN FULLEST BLOOM
AND THEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER OWN FLOWERS AND SHE SANG THE VERSE TO THE LITTLE BOY WHO THEN SANG IT WITH HER THE ROSE IN THE VALLEY IS BLOOMING SO SWEET
SAID KAY THAT'S MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN REAL FLOWERS
SHE'S A DEAR GOOD CREATURE HE REPEATED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF
THEN SHE TOOK OFF HER RED SHOES THE MOST PRECIOUS THINGS SHE POSSESSED
HE WENT ON PUTTING HIS ARM AFFECTIONATELY ROUND HATTA'S NECK HATTA LOOKED ROUND AND NODDED AND WENT ON WITH HIS BREAD AND BUTTER WERE YOU HAPPY IN PRISON DEAR CHILD SAID HAIGHA HATTA LOOKED ROUND ONCE MORE
SO THEY TROTTED ON IN SILENCE TILL THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF A GREAT CROWD IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH THE LION AND UNICORN WERE FIGHTING THEY WERE IN SUCH A CLOUD OF DUST THAT AT FIRST ALICE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHICH WAS WHICH
THAT HE KNEW THE NUMBER OF SQUARE MILES THERE WERE IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND HOW MANY INHABITANTS THEY CONTAINED AND SHE SMILED WHILE HE SPOKE IT THEN SEEMED TO HIM AS IF WHAT HE KNEW WAS NOT ENOUGH AND HE LOOKED UPWARDS
THE KING REMARKED IN A FRETFUL TONE
THE LION HAD JOINED THEM WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON HE LOOKED VERY TIRED AND SLEEPY AND HIS EYES WERE HALF SHUT
PAINTED WITH THE MOST SPLENDID FLOWERS POOR LITTLE CHILD SAID THE OLD WOMAN HOW DID YOU GET UPON THE LARGE RAPID RIVER TO BE DRIVEN ABOUT SO IN THE WIDE WORLD AND THEN THE OLD WOMAN WENT INTO THE WATER
IS THAT A BARGAIN YES IF YOU LIKE SAID ALICE
CHAPTER SEVEN THE LION AND THE UNICORN THE NEXT MOMENT SOLDIERS CAME RUNNING THROUGH THE WOOD AT FIRST IN TWOS AND THREES THEN TEN OR TWENTY TOGETHER AND AT LAST IN SUCH CROWDS
IT WAS THATCHED AND BEFORE IT TWO WOODEN SOLDIERS STOOD SENTRY AND PRESENTED ARMS WHEN ANYONE WENT PAST GERDA CALLED TO THEM FOR SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE ALIVE BUT THEY OF COURSE DID NOT ANSWER SHE CAME CLOSE TO THEM
HOWEVER NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR BREATH YOU MAY TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE TOWN I'LL WHISPER IT SAID THE MESSENGER PUTTING HIS HANDS TO HIS MOUTH IN THE SHAPE OF A TRUMPET AND STOOPING
THERE WAS AN END OF THIS PLEASURE THE WINDOWS WERE OFTEN FROZEN OVER BUT THEN THEY HEATED COPPER FARTHINGS ON THE STOVE AND LAID THE HOT FARTHING ON THE WINDOWPANE AND THEN THEY HAD A CAPITAL PEEP HOLE QUITE NICELY ROUNDED
AND THEN IT MADE ONE SHUDDER FOR THEIR HEART BECAME LIKE A LUMP OF ICE SOME OF THE BROKEN PIECES WERE SO LARGE THAT THEY WERE USED FOR WINDOWPANES THROUGH WHICH ONE COULD NOT SEE ONE'S FRIENDS OTHER PIECES WERE PUT IN SPECTACLES
MY SLEDGE DO NOT FORGET MY SLEDGE IT WAS THE FIRST THING HE THOUGHT OF IT WAS THERE TIED TO ONE OF THE WHITE CHICKENS WHO FLEW ALONG WITH IT ON HIS BACK BEHIND THE LARGE SLEDGE
NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WAS MANY SAD TEARS WERE SHED AND LITTLE GERDA WEPT LONG AND BITTERLY AT LAST SHE SAID HE MUST BE DEAD
WITH A ROUGH WHITE FUR CAP ON HIS HEAD
ALICE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THE BANK OF A LITTLE BROOK WITH THE GREAT DISH ON HER KNEES
ALICE TOOK A PIECE TO TASTE BUT IT WAS VERY DRY I DON'T THINK THEY'LL FIGHT ANY MORE TO DAY THE KING SAID TO HATTA GO AND ORDER THE DRUMS TO BEGIN AND HATTA WENT BOUNDING AWAY LIKE A GRASSHOPPER
THAT'S FULL OF HAY HAIGHA TOOK A LARGE CAKE OUT OF THE BAG AND GAVE IT TO ALICE TO HOLD WHILE HE GOT OUT A DISH AND CARVING KNIFE
HE PRONOUNCED IT SO AS TO RHYME WITH MAYOR I LOVE MY LOVE WITH AN H ALICE COULDN'T HELP BEGINNING BECAUSE HE IS HAPPY I HATE HIM WITH AN H BECAUSE HE IS HIDEOUS
SO SHE CLAMBERED INTO A BOAT WHICH LAY AMONG THE RUSHES WENT TO THE FARTHEST END AND THREW OUT THE SHOES BUT THE BOAT WAS NOT FASTENED AND THE MOTION WHICH SHE OCCASIONED MADE IT DRIFT FROM THE SHORE SHE OBSERVED THIS AND HASTENED TO GET BACK
I SEE NOBODY ON THE ROAD
WITH FROM FOUR TO SIX YOUNG IN A BROOD ASSUMING THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PRODUCT OF A PAIR TO BE TWENTY FOUR YOUNG OF WHICH HALF ARE FEMALES AND HALF MALES
A LUMP ENLARGED PAPILLA ON THE TONGUE IS A SIGN ONE HAS TOLD A LIE
BUT IS THAT NECESSARY HE ASKED WITHOUT APPARENT PERTURBATION CAPTAIN BLOOD'S BLUE EYES APPROVED HIS BEARING ASK YOURSELF SAID HE
CLASP YOUR FINGERS AND IF THE RIGHT THUMB LAP OVER THE LEFT YOU WERE BORN IN THE DAYTIME IF THE LEFT OVERLAP YOU WERE BORN AT NIGHT
ACCEPT THE TRUTHS OF RECORDED REVELATION AS IMMUTABLE BUT AS SUBJECT TO MODIFICATION BY LATER AND PERSONAL REVELATIONS THE THEOSOPHICAL IDEA HAS HAD FOLLOWERS FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES
BUT ONE GLASS IS ALL THAT I CAN GIVE YOU
I REALIZE THAT EVEN A PIRATE HAS HIS HONOUR AND FORTHWITH HE PROPOUNDED HIS OFFER
HUNDRED SIXTEEN A WHITE SPOT IN THE NAIL WHEN IT COMES MEANS A PRESENT YOU GET THE PRESENT WHEN IT GROWS TO THE END AND IS CUT
ONE HUNDRED TWO DIMPLE IN CHIN DEVIL WITHIN CHESTERTOWN MARYLAND ONE HUNDRED THREE A DIMPLE IN THE CHIN IS LUCKY SOME SAY IT SHOWS YOU'RE NO FOOL ONE HUNDRED FOUR
HIS MIND WENT BACK OVER THE ADVENTURE OF YESTERDAY IF OF YESTERDAY IT WAS HE WAS CLEAR ON THE MATTER OF THE EASILY SUCCESSFUL RAID UPON THE ISLAND OF BARBADOS EVERY DETAIL STOOD VIVIDLY IN HIS MEMORY UP TO THE MOMENT AT WHICH
DO NOT TRUST PEOPLE WITH POINTED TEETH CHESTERTOWN MARYLAND
A VEIN ACROSS THE NOSE IS AN OMEN OF SHORT LIFE
THE SPANIARD SIGHED AND SAT UPRIGHT TO FACE THE RETURNING CAPTAIN BLOOD WITH THE ANSWER FOR WHICH HE CAME I HAVE THOUGHT OF AN ALTERNATIVE SIR CAPTAIN BUT IT DEPENDS UPON YOUR CHARITY
AND THERE ARE ONE OR TWO MEN ABOARD WHO CAN ASSIST ME BUT OF THE HIGHER MYSTERIES OF SEAMANSHIP AND OF THE ART OF FINDING A WAY OVER THE TRACKLESS WASTES OF OCEAN WE KNOW NOTHING
DON DIEGO STROKED HIS POINTED BLACK BEARD CAN YOU GIVE ME UNTIL MORNING FOR REFLECTION MY HEAD ACHES SO DAMNABLY THAT I AM INCAPABLE OF THOUGHT AND THIS YOU WILL ADMIT
THE FIRST ENGLISH SPARROW WAS BROUGHT TO THE UNITED STATES IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THAT THE SPECIES CAN BE SAID TO HAVE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED ITSELF
HE TOOK DON DIEGO'S WRIST BETWEEN THUMB AND SECOND FINGER AND THEN AT LAST THE INTRIGUED SPANIARD SPOKE ARE YOU A DOCTOR AMONG OTHER THINGS
WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND TO DON DIEGO'S INCREASING MYSTIFICATION HE BEHELD HIS BEST SUIT OF CLOTHES STEP INTO THE CABIN IT WAS A SINGULARLY ELEGANT AND CHARACTERISTICALLY SPANISH SUIT OF BLACK TAFFETAS
HEAVY EYEBROWS ARE A SIGN OF LONG LIFE
THEN ADVANCED TOWARDS THE COUCH ON WHICH DON DIEGO WAS EXTENDED AND INSIDE THE SUIT CAME A TALL SLENDER GENTLEMAN OF ABOUT DON DIEGO'S OWN HEIGHT AND SHAPE SEEING THE WIDE STARTLED EYES OF THE SPANIARD UPON HIM
WHEN A MAN BECOMES OF AGE THE QUESTION SOMETIMES ARISES WHETHER IT MAN IS ENTITLED TO VOTE AT AN ELECTION HELD ON THE DAY PRECEDING THE TWENTY FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH
ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN ANOTHER FORMULA FIRST FINGER A FRIEND SECOND FINGER A FOE THIRD FINGER A GIFT FOURTH FINGER A BEAU FIFTH FINGER A JOURNEY TO GO
BUT THE FOLLOWING TABLE GIVES A FAIR INDICATION OF PROPER PROPORTIONS
LASTLY HE STARED WILD EYED AT THE SARDONIC CAPTAIN BLOOD AND MY SON
A BROAD SPACE BETWEEN THE TEETH INDICATES A LIAR
WERE CHARLES DARWIN AND HERBERT SPENCER THE LATTER BEGAN HIS GREAT WORK THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT A SINGLE WHITE HAIR MEANS GENIUS IT MUST NOT BE PULLED OUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE IF YOU PULL OUT A WHITE HAIR TWO WILL COME IN ITS PLACE SOMEWHAT GENERAL IN THE UNITED STATES
THE DICE HAD FALLEN AGAINST HIM IN THIS VENTURE THE TABLES HAD BEEN TURNED UPON HIM IN THE VERY MOMENT OF SUCCESS HE ACCEPTED THE SITUATION WITH THE FORTITUDE OF A FATALIST
DON DIEGO STRUGGLED UP INTO A SITTING POSITION ON THE RED VELVET COUCH
BROAD FRONT TEETH MEAN THAT ONE IS GENEROUS BIDDEFORD ME
BUT AS A THEORY EVOLUTION BELONGS TO THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEIBNITZ IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY FIRST UTTERED THE OPINION THAT THE EARTH WAS ONCE IN A FLUID CONDITION
THAT IS THE ISLAND OF BARBADOS WELL ASTERN ALL DAY WE HAVE BEEN SAILING EAST BEFORE THE WIND WITH BUT ONE INTENT TO SET AS GREAT A DISTANCE BETWEEN BARBADOS AND OURSELVES AS POSSIBLE BUT NOW ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND WE ARE IN A DIFFICULTY
IF THE ENDS OF THE FINGERS ARE CAPABLE OF BEING BENT FAR BACK IT INDICATES A THIEF MOLES
ONE HUNDRED SEVEN LONG SLIM EARS ARE A SIGN THAT YOU WILL STEAL CHESTERTOWN MARYLAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHT IF THE PROTUBERANCE BEHIND THE EAR IS LARGE IT INDICATES GENEROSITY
AND ASSUMING FURTHER FOR THE SAKE OF COMPUTATION THAT ALL LIVE TOGETHER WITH THEIR OFFSPRING IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN TEN YEARS THE PROGENY OF A SINGLE PAIR
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN WHITE SPOTS ON THE NAILS OF THE LEFT HAND DENOTE THE NUMBER OF LIES ONE HAS TOLD MAINE AND CENTRAL ILLINOIS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN COUNT ON FINGER NAIL SPOTS
IN THE OTHER WERE THE LIVES OF SIXTEEN MEN FOURTEEN OF THEM MATTERED LITTLE TO HIM BUT THE REMAINING TWO WERE HIS OWN AND HIS SON'S
BUT HOW FAR LIFE WILL BE WORTH LIVING LARGELY DEPENDS UPON WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR HIM POOR CHAP DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HE IS MORE SHATTERED MENTALLY THAN PHYSICALLY
YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS AND JANE SEATED IN A COMFORTABLE CORNER CHOKED BACK THE TEARS OF RELIEF WHICH THREATENED TO FALL DRANK HER COFFEE AND WAS THEREBY MORE REVIVED THAN SHE COULD HAVE THOUGHT POSSIBLE
THAT JANE'S HALF CROWN WAS NOT A PENNY HE HAD A SICK YOUNG WIFE AT HOME WHO HAD BEEN ORDERED EXTRA NOURISHMENT AND JUST AS THE RUSH ON BOARD BEGAN HE HAD PUT UP A SIMPLE PRAYER TO THE HEAVENLY FATHER
A GREAT CALM TOOK ITS PLACE AND JANE DROPPED QUIETLY OFF TO SLEEP YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS WASHED AND BRUSHED AND GREATLY REFRESHED
BUT THE INJURED PARTS WERE PROGRESSING FAVOURABLY AND ALL FEAR OF BRAIN COMPLICATIONS SEEMED OVER DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HOWEVER A SERIOUS REACTION FROM SHOCK HAS SET IN AND IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO SUMMON SIR DERYCK BRAND
AND I SAW A FLASH OF ECSTATIC BRILLIANCE IN HER EYE A GLOW OF GLAD EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE I THOUGHT MY HOUR OF VICTORY WAS COME BUT INSTANTLY A PAINFUL RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO FLASH UPON HER
AT LENGTH I CONCLUDED THAT THE SEPARATION COULD BE ENDURED NO LONGER BY THIS TIME YOU WILL SEE I WAS PRETTY FAR GONE AND TAKING FROM THE BOOK CASE AN OLD VOLUME THAT I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN
AND NEVER GILBERT PUT ME TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW SAID TO YOU SHE EARNESTLY ADDED GIVING ME HER HAND IN SERIOUS KINDNESS HOW SWEET HOW MUSICAL MY OWN NAME SOUNDED IN HER MOUTH
AN HOUR AFTER SHE HAD READ IT SHE WAS DRIVING DOWN THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD TO CAIRO EMBARKED AT ALEXANDRIA THE NEXT DAY LANDED AT BRINDISI
WELL SAID THE DOCTOR NIAGARA IS A BIG THING ISN'T IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO ME WERE YOU NOT DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA WE WERE I FEEL TEMPTED TO WISH FOR ONE HOMICIDAL MOMENT THAT THE EARTH WOULD OPEN HER MOUTH AND SWALLOW THEM UP
AND I OFTEN FELT MYSELF A MOST CONFOUNDED HYPOCRITE WITH IT ALL I SAW TOO OR RATHER I FELT THAT IN SPITE OF HERSELF I WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO HER AS THE NOVEL HEROES MODESTLY EXPRESS IT
MERE CHANCE AND YET TO JANE IT SEEMED SO LIKE HIM TO HAVE TAKEN UP HIS POSITION PRECISELY AT THE RIGHT SPOT ON THAT LONG PLATFORM AN ENTHUSIASTIC LADY PATIENT HAD ONCE SAID OF DERYCK BRAND WITH MORE ACCURACY OF DEFINITION THAN OF GRAMMAR
AND THE SCANDAL MONGERS HAVE GREEDILY SEIZED THE RUMOUR TO MAKE IT THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN INFERNAL STRUCTURE WELL BUT GILBERT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN HER MANNER TO COUNTENANCE SUCH REPORTS DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN HER MANNER
ALL WANTING TO BREAK EVERY POSSIBLE RULE AND REGULATION AND EACH TRYING TO BE THE FIRST PERSON IN THE FRONT ROW REALLY THE PATIENCE AND GOOD TEMPER OF RAILWAY OFFICIALS SHOULD TEACH THE REST OF MANKIND A LESSON THE DOCTOR TALKING ALL THE TIME
WITH A LOOK THAT PLAINLY SAID WHAT THIS TO ME
BUT THEY DON'T SPEAK OPENLY TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS IT IS ONLY BY HINTS AND INNUENDOES AND BY WHAT I HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THEY THINK WELL THEN I WON'T GO TO DAY AS IT'S GETTING LATISH
WITH PLEASURE CRIED MY MOTHER PROCEEDING WITH ALACRITY TO PULL THE BELL AND ORDER THE FAVOURED BEVERAGE I THOUGHT CONTINUED HE I'D JUST LOOK IN UPON YOU AS I PASSED AND TASTE YOUR HOME BREWED ALE
WHICH WAS UPWARDS OF A WEEK AGO I HAD BEEN MAKING DAILY EFFORTS TO MEET ITS MISTRESS IN HER WALKS AND ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED SHE MUST HAVE MANAGED IT SO ON PURPOSE HAD NIGHTLY KEPT REVOLVING IN MY MIND SOME PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER CALL
AFTER HIS CUSTOMARY CHEERFUL AND FATHERLY GREETING OF ROSE WHO WAS RATHER A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE TURNED SOMEWHAT STERNLY TO ME WELL SIR SAID HE YOU'RE QUITE A STRANGER IT IS
JANE NEVER DOUBTED HER ULTIMATE DESTINATION THE ROOM WHERE PAIN AND DARKNESS AND DESPAIR MUST BE WAGING SO TERRIBLE A CONFLICT AGAINST THE MORAL COURAGE THE MENTAL SANITY AND THE INSTINCTIVE HOLD ON LIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED
AND JUST AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO MOVE HANDED A CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE AND A PLATE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN AT THE WINDOW OH THANK YOU MY GOOD FELLOW SAID JANE PUTTING THE PLATE ON THE SEAT WHILE SHE DIVED INTO HER POCKET
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN AND HOW YOUR SISTER'S ROOTS HAVE PROSPERED IN MY CHARGE ADDED SHE AS SHE OPENED THE GATE AND WE SAUNTERED THROUGH THE GARDEN AND TALKED OF THE FLOWERS THE TREES AND THE BOOK
MISSUS GRAHAM HERSELF WAS NOT TO BE SEEN BUT THERE WAS ARTHUR PLAYING WITH HIS FROLICSOME LITTLE DOG IN THE GARDEN I LOOKED OVER THE GATE AND CALLED HIM TO ME HE WANTED ME TO COME IN BUT I TOLD HIM I COULD NOT WITHOUT HIS MOTHER'S LEAVE
AND SEEMED INCLINED TO TURN BACK BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT APPARENTLY JUDGED IT BETTER TO CONTINUE HIS COURSE AS BEFORE HE ACCOSTED ME WITH A SLIGHT BOW AND EDGING CLOSE TO THE WALL ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ON BUT I WAS NOT SO MINDED
THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HIM JANE KNEW BUT SHE FELT UTTERLY UNABLE TO ARRANGE HOW OR IN WHAT WAY HER GOING COULD BE MANAGED THAT IT WAS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM HER COMMON SENSE TOLD HER
AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN MY MOTHER SAT OPPOSITE AN AWE STRUCK BUT ADMIRING AUDITOR MISSUS GRAHAM SAID I HE CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD AS HE SPOKE
AS TO GENERAL ATTENTION TO THE INTEREST AND COMFORT OF HIS FAMILY MUCH EXERTION AND MANY SACRIFICES TO GLANCE AT IN THE FORM OF HURRIED WALKS AND SUDDEN REMOVALS FROM HER OWN FIRESIDE AND MANY EXCELLENT HINTS OF DISTRUST AND ECONOMY
HER SENSATIONS WERE INDEFINABLE AND SO WERE THEY A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS UPON HEARING HENRY CRAWFORD WHO HAD A CHAIR BETWEEN HERSELF AND TOM ASK THE LATTER IN AN UNDERVOICE WHETHER THERE WERE ANY PLANS FOR RESUMING THE PLAY
HE LEFT THE HOUSE IN ALL THE SOBERNESS OF ITS GENERAL CHARACTER AND SIR THOMAS HOPED IN SEEING HIM OUT OF IT TO BE RID OF THE WORST OBJECT CONNECTED WITH THE SCHEME AND THE LAST THAT MUST BE INEVITABLY REMINDING HIM OF ITS EXISTENCE
ARE YOU GOING THIS MORNING ALMOST THIS MOMENT THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE
AND HER MOTHER WHO CONCLUDED THAT A PROMISE HAD BEEN MADE BY WILLOUGHBY THE NIGHT BEFORE OF CALLING ON HER
ENTIRELY AT AN END LOOKING SIGNIFICANTLY AT HIS FATHER THE PAINTER WAS SENT OFF YESTERDAY AND VERY LITTLE WILL REMAIN OF THE THEATRE TO MORROW I KNEW HOW THAT WOULD BE FROM THE FIRST IT IS EARLY FOR BATH YOU WILL FIND NOBODY THERE
TO BE A SECOND TIME DISAPPOINTED IN THE SAME WAY WAS AN INSTANCE OF VERY SEVERE ILL LUCK AND HIS INDIGNATION WAS SUCH THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR DELICACY TOWARDS HIS FRIEND AND HIS FRIEND'S YOUNGEST SISTER
AND MADE A POINT OF BEING INTRODUCED TO HIS MOTHER AND THEN PREVAILED ON MY SISTER TO PAY THE FIRST VISIT I AM AS CERTAIN AS I SIT HERE THAT NOTHING WOULD HAVE COME OF IT FOR MISTER RUSHWORTH IS THE SORT OF AMIABLE MODEST YOUNG MAN WHO WANTS A GREAT DEAL OF ENCOURAGEMENT
MISSUS DASHWOOD'S VISIT TO LADY MIDDLETON TOOK PLACE THE NEXT DAY AND TWO OF HER DAUGHTERS WENT WITH HER BUT MARIANNE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM BEING OF THE PARTY UNDER SOME TRIFLING PRETEXT OF EMPLOYMENT
THE HAND WHICH HAD SO PRESSED HERS TO HIS HEART THE HAND AND THE HEART WERE ALIKE MOTIONLESS AND PASSIVE NOW HER SPIRIT SUPPORTED HER BUT THE AGONY OF HER MIND WAS SEVERE SHE HAD NOT LONG TO ENDURE WHAT AROSE FROM LISTENING TO LANGUAGE
YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THEY WERE GOING TO BE MARRIED UNGRACIOUS GIRL BUT I REQUIRE NO SUCH PROOF NOTHING IN MY OPINION HAS EVER PASSED TO JUSTIFY DOUBT NO SECRECY HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED ALL HAS BEEN UNIFORMLY OPEN AND UNRESERVED
IF MISTER RUSHWORTH WERE A SON OF YOUR OWN HE COULD NOT HOLD SIR THOMAS IN GREATER RESPECT SIR THOMAS GAVE UP THE POINT FOILED BY HER EVASIONS DISARMED BY HER FLATTERY AND WAS OBLIGED TO REST SATISFIED WITH THE CONVICTION
TO LADY BERTRAM AND EDMUND TO DETAIL WHEREBY A MOST CONSIDERABLE SAVING HAD ALWAYS ARISEN AND MORE THAN ONE BAD SERVANT BEEN DETECTED BUT HER CHIEF STRENGTH LAY IN SOTHERTON HER GREATEST SUPPORT AND GLORY
HE WAS GOING AWAY IMMEDIATELY BEING TO MEET HIS UNCLE AT BATH WITHOUT DELAY BUT IF THERE WERE ANY PROSPECT OF A RENEWAL OF LOVERS VOWS HE SHOULD HOLD HIMSELF POSITIVELY ENGAGED HE SHOULD BREAK THROUGH EVERY OTHER CLAIM
AFTER THE PRESENT HAPPY INTERRUPTION WITH A COURTEOUS GLANCE AT SIR THOMAS
AND IS NO ALLOWANCE TO BE MADE FOR INADVERTENCE OR FOR SPIRITS DEPRESSED BY RECENT DISAPPOINTMENT
THAT WHERE THE PRESENT PLEASURE OF THOSE SHE LOVED WAS AT STAKE HER KINDNESS DID SOMETIMES OVERPOWER HER JUDGMENT IT WAS A BUSY MORNING WITH HIM CONVERSATION WITH ANY OF THEM OCCUPIED BUT A SMALL PART OF IT
AND THAT HE FELT FOR US THE ATTACHMENT OF THE NEAREST RELATION HAVE WE NOT PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER HAS NOT MY CONSENT BEEN DAILY ASKED BY HIS LOOKS HIS MANNER HIS ATTENTIVE AND AFFECTIONATE RESPECT
BUT MY HEART QUITE ACHED FOR HIM AT EVERY JOLT AND WHEN WE GOT INTO THE ROUGH LANES ABOUT STOKE WHERE WHAT WITH FROST AND SNOW UPON BEDS OF STONES IT WAS WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE I WAS QUITE IN AN AGONY ABOUT HIM
MISSUS NORRIS BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT HER AND WONDER THAT HIS FALLING IN LOVE WITH JULIA HAD COME TO NOTHING AND COULD ALMOST FEAR THAT SHE HAD BEEN REMISS HERSELF IN FORWARDING IT BUT WITH SO MANY TO CARE FOR
EVERY ONE WAS SILENT MISSUS DASHWOOD FIRST SPOKE I HAVE ONLY TO ADD MY DEAR WILLOUGHBY
IT WAS NOT INCLINATION THAT HE WANTED ELINOR I COULD PLAINLY SEE THAT HE HAD NOT THE POWER OF ACCEPTING IT I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER I ASSURE YOU
MY ENGAGEMENTS AT PRESENT REPLIED WILLOUGHBY CONFUSEDLY ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT I DARE NOT FLATTER MYSELF HE STOPT MISSUS DASHWOOD WAS TOO MUCH ASTONISHED TO SPEAK
AS A DIFFERENCE IN JUDGMENT FROM MYSELF OR A DEVIATION FROM WHAT I MAY THINK RIGHT AND CONSISTENT YOU SPEAK VERY PROPERLY WILLOUGHBY CERTAINLY DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE SUSPECTED
BUT THERE WAS A SOMETHING IN SIR THOMAS WHEN THEY SAT ROUND THE SAME TABLE WHICH MADE MISTER YATES THINK IT WISER TO LET HIM PURSUE HIS OWN WAY AND FEEL THE FOLLY OF IT WITHOUT OPPOSITION HE HAD KNOWN MANY DISAGREEABLE FATHERS BEFORE
AND IS MISSUS SMITH YOUR ONLY FRIEND IS ALLENHAM THE ONLY HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO WHICH YOU WILL BE WELCOME FOR SHAME WILLOUGHBY CAN YOU WAIT FOR AN INVITATION HERE
HE COULD NOT HELP GIVING MISSUS NORRIS A HINT OF HIS HAVING HOPED THAT HER ADVICE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTERPOSED TO PREVENT WHAT HER JUDGMENT MUST CERTAINLY HAVE DISAPPROVED THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN VERY INCONSIDERATE IN FORMING THE PLAN
HE BELIEVED HE SHOULD CERTAINLY ATTACK THE BARONET ON THE ABSURDITY OF HIS PROCEEDINGS AND ARGUE HIM INTO A LITTLE MORE RATIONALITY HE BELIEVED THIS VERY STOUTLY WHILE HE WAS IN MANSFIELD WOOD AND ALL THE WAY HOME
WHAT HAD BEEN SO LATELY PUT UP IN THE BILLIARD ROOM AND GIVEN THE SCENE PAINTER HIS DISMISSAL LONG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE PLEASING BELIEF OF HIS BEING THEN AT LEAST AS FAR OFF AS NORTHAMPTON THE SCENE PAINTER WAS GONE HAVING SPOILT ONLY THE FLOOR OF ONE ROOM
WHILE VINDICATING HIMSELF TO SAY NOTHING UNKIND OF THE OTHERS BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE AMONGST THEM WHOSE CONDUCT HE COULD MENTION WITHOUT SOME NECESSITY OF DEFENCE OR PALLIATION WE HAVE ALL BEEN MORE OR LESS TO BLAME SAID HE
AND PEEPING ROUND SAW THAT MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CORRECT IT WAS THE KELPIE SHE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER VERY SOFTLY AFRAID OF BEING LOCKED OUT A DANGER WHICH HAD SCARCELY OCCURRED TO ME BEFORE
BUT I RODE QUIETLY UP TO THE BACK OF THE YARD WHERE THE RICKS STOOD GOT OFF MISSY AND FASTENED THE BRIDLE TO THE GATE AND WALKED ACROSS TO THE CART SHED WHERE THE MOON WAS SHINING UPON THE LADDER LEADING UP TO THE LOFT
AND HE'D BETTER GO HOME AGAIN AS FAST AS HE CAN IF JOHN ADAM SHOULD COME OUT I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN OR PERHAPS HE'D LIKE TO STOP AND KEEP YOU COMPANY NO THANK YOU MISS ADAM
THEN TURNED TO THE CAB AND SAID BEFORE MISTER EVANS HAD QUITE BEGUN TO THINK SOMETHING MUST BE AMISS PLEASE SIR MY HARNESS HAS GIVEN AWAY WOULD YOU MIND STEPPING IN HERE FOR A FEW MINUTES THEY'RE FRIENDS OF MINE I'LL TAKE YOU WHERE YOU LIKE AFTER I'VE GOT IT MENDED
AND MISTER EVANS HAD GONE OUT WITH IT IN THE HOPE OF TURNING ITS CARGO TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE HE WAS ONE OF THE SINGLE BOAT LOAD WHICH MANAGED TO REACH A DESERT ISLAND
YOUNGER THAN WE ARE O CHILDREN AND FRAILER SOON IN THE BLUE AIR THEY'LL BE SINGER AND SAILOR WE SO MUCH OLDER TALLER AND STRONGER
THAT STORY WAS NOW FAR OFF IN THE PAST
JUST AS IT WAS SHUT AWAY TOY LIKE IN THE EVEN HERE I SEE IT GLOW WITH DAY UNDER GLOWING HEAVEN EVERY PATH AND EVERY PLOT
THE NEXT MORNING DIAMOND WAS UP ALMOST AS EARLY AS BEFORE HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR FROM HIS MOTHER NOW AND MADE NO SECRET OF WHAT HE WAS ABOUT BY THE TIME HE REACHED THE STABLE SEVERAL OF THE MEN WERE THERE
FOR THEY HARDLY KNOW LIGHT FROM DARKNESS WELL AT FIRST THE MOON FRIGHTENED ME A LITTLE SHE LOOKED SO KNOWING AND YET ALL SHE SAID ROUND ABOUT ME WAS SO STRANGE
NOTWITHSTANDING IN FACT I OWED THE GREATER PART OF THE COURAGE I POSSESSED
SPRING AND DAISIES CAME APACE GRASSES HIDE MY HIDING PLACE
FAIR ARE GROWN UP PEOPLE'S TREES
IN THE DARKNESS HOUSES SHINE PARENTS MOVE THE CANDLES TILL ON ALL THE NIGHT DIVINE TURNS THE BEDROOM HANDLES TILL AT LAST THE DAY BEGINS
ROUND THE BRIGHT AIR WITH FOOTING TRUE
SENSIBLE TALKING WE ON OUR FEET MUST GO
AND DID WORK WORTH DOING FOR A FORTNIGHT DIAMOND WENT ON DRIVING HIS CAB AND KEEPING HIS FAMILY HE HAD BEGUN TO BE KNOWN ABOUT SOME PARTS OF LONDON
THE OTHER END HAD BEEN TIED TO HER WRIST THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENED HE MIGHT PULL HER
BUT HE WAS NOT PAST BEING TAUGHT AND HIS TROUBLES HAD DONE HIM NO END OF GOOD FOR THEY HAD MADE HIM DOUBT HIMSELF
WHICH HE COULD NOT REFUSE BECAUSE HIS MOTHER WANTED THEM SO MUCH AT HOME FOR HIS FATHER HE LEFT THEM NEARLY AS HAPPY AS THEY WERE THEMSELVES THE REST OF THE DAY HE DID BETTER AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT SO MUCH TO TAKE HOME AS THE DAY BEFORE
WITH ONLY THE WIDE SILENT FIELDS ABOUT ME AND THE WIDER AND MORE SILENT SKY OVER MY HEAD THE FEAR BEGAN TO RETURN I FANCIED SOMETHING STRANGE CREEPING ALONG EVERY DITCH
HE WAS JUST CLAMBERING UP AGAIN WHEN THE GENTLEMAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAID IT'S THE WILDERNESS MISTER COLEMAN'S PLACE BUT I'LL DIRECT YOU WHEN WE COME INTO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT FLASHED UPON DIAMOND WHO HE WAS
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
LOOKING AFTER YOU OF COURSE THAT'S WHY YOU LOCKED THE DOOR I SUPPOSE TO KEEP ME OUT SHE HAD NO ANSWER READY BUT LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE STRUCK ME
SO DIAMOND RAN IN AND HAD ANOTHER MOUTHFUL OF TEA AND BREAD AND BUTTER AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO TIRED AS HE WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE HE STARTED QUITE FRESH THIS MORNING IT WAS A CLOUDY DAY AND THE WIND BLEW HARD FROM THE NORTH
AWAY BEHIND THE CURRANT ROW WHERE NO ONE ELSE BUT COOK MAY GO FAR IN THE PLOTS
GARDEN DARKENED DAISY SHUT CHILD IN BED THEY SLUMBER GLOW WORM IN THE HALLWAY RUT MICE AMONG THE LUMBER
WHEN THE GRASS IS RIPE LIKE GRAIN
I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE HER APPEARANCE IT WAS PECULIAR ENOUGH FOR SHE HAD JUST GOT OUT OF BED AND THROWN AN OLD SHAWL ABOUT HER SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT TO LOOK AT
THE DUSTY ATTIC SPIDER CLAD HE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE MAKETH GLAD AND THROUGH THE BROKEN EDGE OF TILES INTO THE LADDERED HAY LOFT SMILES
I WENT HOME AT A GOOD GALLOP TOOK OFF THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE AND LAID THEM IN A CART IN THE SHED TURNED MISSY LOOSE INTO THE STABLE SHUT THE DOOR AND RAN ACROSS THE FIELD TO THE MANSE
HERE WE HAD BEST ON TIP TOE TREAD WHILE I FOR SAFETY MARCH AHEAD FOR THIS IS THAT ENCHANTED GROUND WHERE ALL WHO LOITER SLUMBER SOUND
YOUNG DIAMOND JUMPED OFF HIS BOX
FOR HIS WORK WAS NOT TO DIG STARS BUT TO DRIVE OLD DIAMOND AND PICK UP FARES THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN THINK ABOUT BEAUTIFUL THINGS AND DO COMMON WORK AT THE SAME TIME BUT THEN THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
SHE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT STRUCK ONCE MORE THE ROSARY'S OPENING CHORD AND DID AS GARTH HAD BIDDEN HER TO DO THE HOURS I SPENT WITH THEE DEAR HEART ARE AS A STRING OF PEARLS TO ME I COUNT THEM OVER EV'RY ONE APART
MY ROSARY SOFTLY THOUGHTFULLY TENDERLY THE LAST TWO WORDS WERE BREATHED INTO THE SILENCE HOLDING A WORLD OF REMINISCENCE A LARGE HEARTED WOMAN'S FAITHFUL REMEMBRANCE OF TENDER MOMENTS IN THE PAST
HAD SOUGHT JANE CHAMPION ON THE TERRACE AND STOOD BEFORE HER IN THE SOFT LIGHT OF THE HANGING CHINESE LANTERNS THE CRIMSON RAMBLER IN HIS BUTTON HOLE AND HIS RED SILK SOCKS WHICH MATCHED IT LENT AN ARTISTIC TOUCH OF COLOUR TO THE CONVENTIONAL BLACK AND WHITE OF HIS EVENING CLOTHES
MY NIECE JANE CHAMPION HAS KINDLY CONSENTED TO STEP INTO THE BREACH WHICH MEANS THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO STEP UP ON TO THAT PLATFORM IN ANOTHER HALF MINUTE
BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE QUIET VOICE FELL SOOTHINGLY EXPRESSING A STRENGTH OF ENDURANCE WHICH WOULD FAIL IN NO CRISIS NOR FEAR TO FACE ANY DEPTHS OF PAIN YET GATHERING TO ITSELF A POIGNANCY OF SWEETNESS
AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE STOOD GARTH DALMAIN HIS FACE WAS ABSOLUTELY COLOURLESS AND HIS EYES SHONE OUT FROM IT LIKE BURNING STARS HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS UNTIL SHE STEPPED FROM THE LAST STAIR AND STOOD CLOSE TO HIM THEN WITH A SUDDEN MOVEMENT
WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS MOVEMENT OF GRACIOUS FRIENDLINESS GARTH STEPPED CLOSE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE AND TOOK THEM IN HIS WHILE SHE WAS STILL ON THE STEP ABOVE HIM FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT SPEAK THEN IN A LOW VOICE VIBRANT WITH EMOTION
WITHOUT A WORD SHE QUIETLY MOUNTED THE STEPS AND WALKED ACROSS THE PLATFORM TO THE PIANO PEOPLE WERE STILL APPLAUDING AND REDOUBLED THEIR DEMONSTRATIONS OF DELIGHT AS SHE APPEARED BUT JANE TOOK HER SEAT AT THE INSTRUMENT WITHOUT GIVING THEM A THOUGHT
O BARREN GAIN AND BITTER LOSS I KISS EACH BEAD AND STRIVE AT LAST TO LEARN TO KISS THE CROSS TO KISS THE CROSS WHEN JANE LEFT THE PLATFORM GARTH WAS STILL STANDING MOTIONLESS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
HE CAUGHT HER BY THE SHOULDERS AND TURNED HER ROUND GO BACK HE SAID AND THE OVERMASTERING NEED QUIVERING IN HIS VOICE DREW JANE'S EYES TO HIS IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT GO BACK AT ONCE AND SING IT ALL OVER AGAIN NOTE FOR NOTE WORD FOR WORD
THE LAST FOUR WORDS WERE GIVEN WITH A SUDDEN POWER AND PASSION
RENDERED RICHER BY THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING O MEMORIES THAT BLESS AND BURN O BARREN GAIN AND BITTER LOSS I KISS EACH BEAD AND STRIVE AT LAST TO LEARN TO KISS THE CROSS TO KISS THE CROSS
BECAUSE SAID GARTH VERY LOW YOU LIFTED THE VEIL AND I I PASSED WITHIN
WHILE SHE PLAYED THE HANDEL THEME
REPEATED GARTH A SHADE OF PERPLEXITY CROSSING HIS FACE I DO
AS SHE TOOK HER SEAT JANE SUDDENLY MADE UP HER MIND NOT TO SING THE ROSARY AGAIN SHE HAD MANY FINER SONGS IN HER REPERTOIRE THE AUDIENCE EXPECTED ANOTHER WHY SHOULD SHE DISAPPOINT THOSE EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE OF THE IMPERIOUS DEMANDS OF
AN UNREASONABLE ORDER OR A REASONABLE ONE UNEXPLAINED PROMPTLY MET WITH A POINT BLANK REFUSAL AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC STILL OBTAINED THOUGH MODIFIED BY TIME AND EVEN THE DUCHESS AS A RULE SAID PLEASE TO JANE
BUT NOW A YOUNG MAN WITH A WHITE FACE AND BLAZING EYES HAD UNCEREMONIOUSLY SWUNG HER ROUND ORDERED HER UP THE STAIRS AND COMMANDED HER TO SING A SONG OVER AGAIN NOTE FOR NOTE WORD FOR WORD AND SHE WAS MEEKLY GOING TO OBEY
LEFT THE PLATFORM BY THE SIDE STAIRCASE BUT THERE BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE SEMI DARKNESS OF SCREENS AND CURTAINS A FRESH SURPRISE AWAITED JANE MORE STARTLING THAN THE ENTHUSIASTIC TUMULT OF HER AUDIENCE
ROSE IN A RAPID CRESCENDO OF QUIVERING PAIN EACH HOUR A PEARL EACH PEARL A PRAYER TO STILL A HEART IN ABSENCE WRUNG I TELL EACH BEAD UNTO THE END AND THERE A CROSS IS HUNG
VOLUNTEERING TO SING VELMA'S SONG
JANE LOOKED UP FROM THE COMFORTABLE DEPTHS OF HER WICKER CHAIR THEN SMILED AT HIS ANXIOUS FACE I AM READY SHE SAID AND RISING WALKED BESIDE HIM HAS IT GONE WELL SHE ASKED IS IT A GOOD AUDIENCE PACKED REPLIED GARTH
SHE SMILED AS SHE CAME SLOWLY DOWN THE STEPS
A BECHSTEIN GRAND GLANCED AT THE FESTOONS OF WHITE ROSES AND THE CROSS OF CRIMSON RAMBLERS THEN WITHOUT FURTHER PRELIMINARIES STRUCK THE OPENING CHORD AND COMMENCED TO SING THE DEEP PERFECT VOICE THRILLED THROUGH THE ROOM
SO YOU LIKED MY SONG SHE SAID LIKED
AFTER WHICH THE DUCHESS EXPLAINS VELMA'S LARYNGITIS LET US HOPE SHE WILL NOT CALL IT APPENDICITIS' AND THEN I USHER YOU UP ARE YOU READY
NOW THE DUCHESS HAS DONE COME ON MIND THE BOTTOM STEP HANG IT ALL HOW DARK IT IS BEHIND THIS CURTAIN GARTH GAVE HER HIS HAND AND JANE MOUNTED THE STEPS AND PASSED INTO VIEW OF THE LARGE AUDIENCE ASSEMBLED IN THE OVERDENE CONCERT ROOM
IT OBVIATES THE BOTHER OF TURNING OVER THEY PASSED INTO THE CONCERT ROOM AND STOOD BEHIND SCREENS AND A CURTAIN CLOSE TO THE HALF DOZEN STEPS LEADING FROM THE SIDE UP ON TO THE PLATFORM OH HARK TO THE DUCHESS WHISPERED GARTH
WITH OLD LACE AT HER BOSOM AND ONE STRING OF PEARLS ROUND HER NECK WHEN SHE APPEARED THE AUDIENCE GAZED AT HER AND APPLAUDED DOUBTFULLY VELMA'S NAME ON THE PROGRAMME HAD RAISED GREAT EXPECTATIONS AND HERE WAS MISS CHAMPION WHO CERTAINLY PLAYED VERY NICELY
CAN POSSIBLY REALISE HOW SHE SANG I KISS EACH BEAD THE LINGERING RETROSPECTION IN EACH WORD BREATHED OUT A LOVE SO WOMANLY SO BEAUTIFUL SO TENDER THAT HER IDENTITY WAS FORGOTTEN EVEN BY THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO KNEW HER BEST
THE LISTENING CROWD HELD ITS BREATH THIS WAS NOT A SONG THIS WAS THE THROBBING OF A HEART AND IT THROBBED IN TONES OF SUCH SWEETNESS THAT TEARS STARTED UNBIDDEN THEN THE VOICE WHICH HAD RENDERED THE OPENING LINES SO QUIETLY
LOOK AT HIS WINGS SAID HE HE REMINDS ME RATHER OF A WEST INDIAN INSECT ONE DOES NOT OFTEN SEE SO LARGE AND GAY A NIGHT ROVER IN ENGLAND THERE
IN SHORT SHE'S AN EXTENSIVE ARMFUL BUT THAT'S NOT TO THE POINT
AND IF THAT BOISTEROUS CHANNEL AND TWO HUNDRED MILES OR SO OF LAND COME BROAD BETWEEN US I AM AFRAID THAT CORD OF COMMUNION WILL BE SNAPT AND THEN
IT WOULD BE PAST THE POWER OF MAGIC SIR AND IN THOUGHT I ADDED A LOVING EYE IS ALL THE CHARM NEEDED TO SUCH YOU ARE HANDSOME ENOUGH
AND FURNACE FLAME AT ONE POINT ON ONE HILL PEAK AND EXTENDING HIGH AND WIDE SOFT AND STILL
YES SIR IN DIFFERENT WAYS I HAVE AN AFFECTION FOR BOTH
I STEP ASIDE INTO THE IVY RECESS HE WILL NOT STAY LONG HE WILL SOON RETURN WHENCE HE CAME AND IF I SIT STILL HE WILL NEVER SEE ME BUT NO
THEY ARE MAKING HAY TOO IN THORNFIELD MEADOWS OR RATHER THE LABOURERS ARE JUST QUITTING THEIR WORK AND RETURNING HOME WITH THEIR RAKES ON THEIR SHOULDERS
I BELIEVE YOU MUST JANE I AM SORRY JANET BUT I BELIEVE INDEED YOU MUST THIS WAS A BLOW BUT I DID NOT LET IT PROSTRATE ME
HILLO HE CRIES AND HE PUTS UP HIS BOOK AND HIS PENCIL THERE YOU ARE COME ON IF YOU PLEASE I SUPPOSE I DO COME ON
YET A MONTH ELAPSED BEFORE I QUITTED GATESHEAD I WISHED TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FUNERAL BUT GEORGIANA ENTREATED ME TO STAY TILL SHE COULD GET OFF TO LONDON WHITHER
IT IS TO BE SURE AND WHEN YOU GET TO BITTERNUTT LODGE CONNAUGHT IRELAND I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN JANE
HOW IS IT TO BE HELPED ARE YOU ANYTHING AKIN TO ME DO YOU THINK JANE I COULD RISK NO SORT OF ANSWER BY THIS TIME MY HEART WAS STILL BECAUSE HE SAID
WHERE YOU SIR HAVE PLACED IT BEFORE ME IN WHAT SHAPE IN THE SHAPE OF MISS INGRAM A NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN YOUR BRIDE MY BRIDE
IN ABOUT A MONTH I HOPE TO BE A BRIDEGROOM CONTINUED MISTER ROCHESTER AND IN THE INTERIM I SHALL
OF A BALL ROOM THE OTHER THE INMATE OF A CONVENT CELL AND I DWELT ON AND ANALYSED THEIR SEPARATE PECULIARITIES OF PERSON AND CHARACTER
FULL LEAVED AND DEEPLY TINTED CONTRASTED WELL WITH THE SUNNY HUE OF THE CLEARED MEADOWS BETWEEN ON MIDSUMMER EVE ADELE
HEARD OF A PLACE THAT I THINK WILL SUIT IT IS TO UNDERTAKE THE EDUCATION
NO VISITS TO INGRAM PARK TO BE SURE IT WAS TWENTY MILES OFF ON THE BORDERS OF ANOTHER COUNTY BUT WHAT WAS THAT DISTANCE TO AN ARDENT LOVER
DEAD AND TELLS ME SO WHEN SHE MEETS ME ALONE HERE IN THE GLOAMING IF I DARED I'D TOUCH YOU TO SEE IF YOU ARE SUBSTANCE OR SHADOW YOU ELF
MISSUS FAIRFAX RECEIVED ME WITH HER USUAL PLAIN FRIENDLINESS LEAH SMILED AND EVEN SOPHIE BID ME BON SOIR WITH GLEE
THE SWEETEST HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR DAY ITS FERVID FIRES HAD WASTED AND DEW FELL COOL ON PANTING PLAIN AND SCORCHED SUMMIT
THAT I CONSENT THUS TO RENDER IT SO PATIENT AND COMPLIANT ON MY PART AT LAST I SAW GEORGIANA OFF
AT THE BOTTOM WAS A SUNK FENCE
YOU HAVE SOME SENSE I THEN RETURNED YOU ARE NOT WITHOUT SENSE COUSIN ELIZA BUT WHAT YOU HAVE I SUPPOSE IN ANOTHER YEAR WILL BE WALLED UP ALIVE IN A FRENCH CONVENT
AND WHICH HE USED BUT ON RARE OCCASIONS HE SEEMED TO THINK IT TOO GOOD FOR COMMON PURPOSES IT WAS THE REAL SUNSHINE OF FEELING HE SHED IT OVER ME NOW PASS
SHE STAYED IN HER OWN ROOM HER DOOR BOLTED WITHIN FILLING TRUNKS EMPTYING DRAWERS BURNING PAPERS AND HOLDING NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANY ONE
I THAT EVENING SHUT MY EYES RESOLUTELY AGAINST THE FUTURE
AGAINST THE VOICE THAT KEPT WARNING ME OF NEAR SEPARATION AND COMING GRIEF
TO SO PRACTISED AND INDEFATIGABLE A HORSEMAN AS MISTER ROCHESTER IT WOULD BE BUT A MORNING'S RIDE I BEGAN TO CHERISH HOPES I HAD NO RIGHT TO CONCEIVE
FOR I DID NOT WISH EITHER CAR OR CARRIAGE TO MEET ME AT MILLCOTE I PROPOSED TO WALK THE DISTANCE QUIETLY BY MYSELF AND VERY QUIETLY AFTER LEAVING MY BOX IN THE OSTLER'S CARE
WELL SIR I SHALL BE READY WHEN THE ORDER TO MARCH COMES IT IS COME NOW I MUST GIVE IT TO NIGHT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO BE MARRIED SIR
FOR YOU OUGHT TO SEE THE SHOULDERS HE HAS BUT SOMETIMES CONCLUDED PAUL WITH A SIGH AND A MEDITATIVE AIR I REALLY THINK PORRIDGE WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME ANNE PERMITTED HERSELF A SMILE SINCE PAUL WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER
FOR YOU ARE DEARER TO ME THAN ANYBODY CAN CONCEIVE I AM QUITE UNEASY ABOUT YOUR DEAR BROTHER NOT HAVING HEARD FROM HIM SINCE HE WENT TO OXFORD AND AM FEARFUL OF SOME MISUNDERSTANDING YOUR KIND OFFICES WILL SET ALL RIGHT
PRAY EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO HIS SATISFACTION OR IF HE STILL HARBOURS ANY DOUBT A LINE FROM HIMSELF TO ME OR A CALL AT PUTNEY WHEN NEXT IN TOWN MIGHT SET ALL TO RIGHTS I HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE ROOMS THIS AGE
SPLENDID ANNE AGREED GRAY SHINING EYES LOOKING DOWN INTO BLUE SHINING ONES ANNE AND PAUL BOTH KNEW HOW FAIR THE REALM IMAGINATION OPENS TO THE VIEW
YOUR KINDNESS WON HIS LOVE AFTER THE IDEA THAT A GIRL WAS NO GOOD WAS ROOTED OUT OF HIS STUBBORN MIND HE MAY HAVE DESERVED IT BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT IF I HAD CALMLY AND DELIBERATELY DECIDED TO WHIP HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT A JUST PUNISHMENT FOR HIM
DO YOU KNOW MISSUS ALLAN I'M SO THANKFUL FOR FRIENDSHIP IT BEAUTIFIES LIFE SO MUCH TRUE FRIENDSHIP IS A VERY HELPFUL THING INDEED SAID MISSUS ALLAN AND WE SHOULD HAVE A VERY HIGH IDEAL OF IT
AND TWO DELIGHTFUL MONTHS OF A WELL EARNED VACATION BECKONED HER INVITINGLY ANNE FELT AT PEACE WITH THE WORLD AND HERSELF AS SHE WALKED DOWN THE HILL WITH HER BASKET OF FLOWERS IN HER HAND
THEY ARE VERY INTIMATE AND GO EVERYWHERE TOGETHER BUT GERTIE IS ALWAYS SAYING NASTY THINGS OF JULIA BEHIND HER BACK AND EVERYBODY THINKS SHE IS JEALOUS OF HER BECAUSE SHE IS ALWAYS SO PLEASED WHEN ANYBODY CRITICIZES JULIA I THINK IT IS DESECRATION TO CALL THAT FRIENDSHIP
AND HER DEMANDS IMPUDENT WRITE TO JAMES ON HER BEHALF NO JAMES SHOULD NEVER HEAR ISABELLA'S NAME MENTIONED BY HER AGAIN ON HENRY'S ARRIVAL FROM WOODSTON
AND BOTH KNEW THE WAY TO THAT HAPPY LAND THERE THE ROSE OF JOY BLOOMED IMMORTAL BY DALE AND STREAM CLOUDS NEVER DARKENED THE SUNNY SKY SWEET BELLS NEVER JANGLED OUT OF TUNE AND KINDRED SPIRITS ABOUNDED
NOBODY ELSE UNDERSTANDS SO WELL NOT EVEN GRANDMA ALTHOUGH SHE'S SO GOOD TO ME FATHER UNDERSTOOD PRETTY WELL BUT STILL I COULDN'T TALK MUCH TO HIM ABOUT MOTHER BECAUSE IT MADE HIM FEEL SO BAD
I'M THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN SEE THEM BUT YOU COULD SEE ROCK PEOPLE OF YOUR OWN YOU'RE ONE OF THE KIND THAT CAN WE'RE BOTH THAT KIND YOU KNOW TEACHER HE ADDED SQUEEZING HER HAND CHUMMILY ISN'T IT SPLENDID TO BE THAT KIND TEACHER
ANNE WAS STILL SITTING THERE WHEN A SHADOW FELL OVER THE GRASS AND SHE LOOKED UP TO SEE MISSUS ALLAN THEY WALKED HOME TOGETHER MISSUS ALLAN'S FACE WAS NOT THE FACE OF THE GIRLBRIDE WHOM THE MINISTER HAD BROUGHT TO AVONLEA FIVE YEARS BEFORE
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR VACATION ANNE SHE SAID AS THEY LEFT THE GRAVEYARD ANNE NODDED YES I COULD ROLL THE WORD AS A SWEET MORSEL UNDER MY TONGUE I THINK THE SUMMER IS GOING TO BE LOVELY
BUT AM AFRAID YOU NEVER THINK OF ME I WILL NOT SAY ALL THAT I COULD OF THE FAMILY YOU ARE WITH BECAUSE I WOULD NOT BE UNGENEROUS OR SET YOU AGAINST THOSE YOU ESTEEM BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHOM TO TRUST
THANK GOD WE LEAVE THIS VILE PLACE TOMORROW SINCE YOU WENT AWAY I HAVE HAD NO PLEASURE IN IT THE DUST IS BEYOND ANYTHING AND EVERYBODY ONE CARES FOR IS GONE I BELIEVE IF I COULD SEE YOU I SHOULD NOT MIND THE REST
I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN SAID ANNE THOUGHTFULLY AND I KNOW I HAVE SO MUCH TO FEEL THANKFUL FOR OH SO MUCH MY WORK AND PAUL IRVING AND THE DEAR TWINS AND ALL MY FRIENDS
BUT WE MUST FIRST SUPPOSE ISABELLA TO HAVE HAD A HEART TO LOSE CONSEQUENTLY TO HAVE BEEN A VERY DIFFERENT CREATURE AND IN THAT CASE SHE WOULD HAVE MET WITH VERY DIFFERENT TREATMENT IT IS VERY RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD STAND BY YOUR BROTHER
SHE MADE KNOWN TO HIM AND ELEANOR THEIR BROTHER'S SAFETY CONGRATULATING THEM WITH SINCERITY ON IT AND READING ALOUD THE MOST MATERIAL PASSAGES OF HER LETTER WITH STRONG INDIGNATION WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED IT SO MUCH FOR ISABELLA
I AM PERSUADED THAT HE NEVER DID AND ONLY MADE BELIEVE TO DO SO FOR MISCHIEF'S SAKE HENRY BOWED HIS ASSENT WELL THEN I MUST SAY THAT I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL
I WOULD NOT EVEN LOOK AT HIM HE WENT INTO THE PUMP ROOM AFTERWARDS BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE FOLLOWED HIM FOR ALL THE WORLD SUCH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HIM AND YOUR BROTHER PRAY SEND ME SOME NEWS OF THE LATTER I AM QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT HIM
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING VERY UNEXPECTED LETTER FROM ISABELLA BATH APRIL MY DEAREST CATHERINE
ANNE PUT ON MATTHEW'S GRAVE THE FLOWERS SHE HAD BROUGHT FOR IT AND THEN WENT OVER TO THE LITTLE POPLAR SHADED CORNER WHERE HESTER GRAY SLEPT EVER SINCE THE DAY OF THE SPRING PICNIC ANNE HAD PUT FLOWERS ON HESTER'S GRAVE WHEN SHE VISITED MATTHEW'S
WHO AS YOU MAY REMEMBER WAS AMAZINGLY DISPOSED TO FOLLOW AND TEASE ME BEFORE YOU WENT AWAY AFTERWARDS HE GOT WORSE AND BECAME QUITE MY SHADOW MANY GIRLS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN FOR NEVER WERE SUCH ATTENTIONS
I BELIEVE IT HAS COME ALREADY FOR GRANDMA IS KEEPING THE BOOKCASE DRAWER LOCKED AND THAT IS SOMETHING NEW AND WHEN I ASKED HER WHY SHE JUST LOOKED MYSTERIOUS AND SAID LITTLE BOYS MUSTN'T BE TOO CURIOUS IT'S VERY EXCITING TO HAVE A BIRTHDAY ISN'T IT
AND YOUNG MEN NEVER KNOW THEIR MINDS TWO DAYS TOGETHER I REJOICE TO SAY THAT THE YOUNG MAN WHOM OF ALL OTHERS I PARTICULARLY ABHOR HAS LEFT BATH YOU WILL KNOW FROM THIS DESCRIPTION I MUST MEAN CAPTAIN TILNEY
THE OPPRESSION OF WHICH COULD NOT BE RELIEVED BY ANY DAILY ACTION SUCH AS COMFORTING THE SURVIVORS OR TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL IN HOPE OF LESSENING THE EVILS IN THE GENERATION TO COME MISTER HALE DID NOT GO OUT AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS AS MUCH AS USUAL
THE SUCCEEDING SECTIONS OF THE BOOK TREAT IN SOME DETAIL THE LIGHT CAST ON SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS BY MENTAL ANALYSIS A PROCESS WHICH NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE CONDUCTED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A DEGRADED MATERIALISM
MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN SOME COTTAGE IN THE GREEN SHADE OF THE FOREST HER OUT OF DOORS LIFE WAS PERFECT HER IN DOORS LIFE HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY
TOO PLAINLY FOR BEAUTY IF HIS FEATURES HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT AS IT WAS THEY HAD A GRACE IF NOT A COMELINESS OF THEIR OWN THE FACE WAS IN REPOSE BUT IT WAS RATHER REST AFTER WEARINESS
BUT SURELY IT IS A VERY EASY JOURNEY TO LONDON YES BUT SOMEHOW SAID FANNY LOWERING HER VOICE MAMMA HAS NEVER BEEN TO LONDON HERSELF AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY LONGING
THIS BOOK OWES ITS ORIGIN TO THE FACT THAT IN THE AUTUMN OF NINETEEN TWENTY ONE THE AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE OXFORD INVITED ME TO DELIVER THE INAUGURAL COURSE OF A LECTURESHIP IN RELIGION NEWLY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE WILL OF THE LATE PROFESSOR UPTON
HER MOTHER HAD BEEN DETAINED AT HOME BY A MULTITUDE OF HALF REASONS NONE OF WHICH ANYBODY FULLY UNDERSTOOD EXCEPT MISTER HALE WHO WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT ALL HIS ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF A GREY SATIN GOWN
SHE HAD LEARNT DRAWING WITH EDITH AND SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY REGRETTED DURING THE GLOOM OF THE BAD WEATHER HER IDLE REVELLING IN THE BEAUTY OF THE WOODLANDS WHILE IT HAD YET BEEN FINE TO MAKE HER DETERMINED TO SKETCH WHAT SHE COULD
BY HER CONSCIOUS PRIDE IN BEING ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEM ALL IF NEED WERE BUT THE CLOUD NEVER COMES IN THAT QUARTER OF THE HORIZON FROM WHICH WE WATCH FOR IT THERE HAD BEEN SLIGHT COMPLAINTS AND PASSING REGRETS ON HER MOTHER'S PART
EVERY IMPROVEMENT OF MACHINERY IS I BELIEVE TO BE SEEN THERE IN ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T LIKE MILLS AND MANUFACTORIES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS SAID FANNY IN A HALF WHISPER
BUT THE EVENINGS WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO FILL UP AGREEABLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER TEA HER FATHER WITHDREW INTO HIS SMALL LIBRARY AND SHE AND HER MOTHER WERE LEFT ALONE MISSUS HALE HAD NEVER CARED MUCH FOR BOOKS
WERE BY FAR THE LIGHTEST NEWEST AND MOST AMUSING THE BOOK SHELVES DID NOT AFFORD MUCH RESOURCE MARGARET TOLD HER MOTHER EVERY PARTICULAR OF HER LONDON LIFE TO ALL OF WHICH MISSUS HALE LISTENED WITH INTEREST
BUT ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY LADY BERESFORD AS LADIES MAID TO SIR JOHN'S WARDS THE PRETTY MISS BERESFORDS THE BELLES OF RUTLANDSHIRE
AND HAD DISCOURAGED HER HUSBAND VERY EARLY IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE IN HIS DESIRE OF READING ALOUD TO HER WHILE SHE WORKED AT ONE TIME THEY HAD TRIED BACKGAMMON AS A RESOURCE BUT AS MISTER HALE GREW TO TAKE AN INCREASING INTEREST IN HIS SCHOOL AND HIS PARISHIONERS
MISSUS THORNTON WAS SHY IT WAS ONLY OF LATE YEARS THAT SHE HAD HAD LEISURE ENOUGH IN HER LIFE TO GO INTO SOCIETY AND AS SOCIETY SHE DID NOT ENJOY IT
AS SHE FELT IT YIELD UNDER HER LIGHT FOOT AND SEND UP THE FRAGRANCE PECULIAR TO IT OUT ON THE BROAD COMMONS INTO THE WARM SCENTED LIGHT SEEING MULTITUDES OF WILD FREE LIVING CREATURES REVELLING IN THE SUNSHINE
BUT THE LITTLE ALTERCATION BETWEEN HER SON AND HER DAUGHTER DID NOT INCLINE MISSUS THORNTON MORE FAVOURABLY TOWARDS THESE HALES HER JEALOUS HEART REPEATED HER DAUGHTER'S QUESTION
ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
WARM GRATITUDE FIRST TO THE PRINCIPAL AND AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE WHO GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY OF DELIVERING THESE CHAPTERS IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND WHOSE UNFAILING SYMPATHY AND KINDNESS SO GREATLY HELPED ME
AND SHE REPINED EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY THAT HER HUSBAND WHO WAS MORE LEARNED THAN MISTER HUME A BETTER PARISH PRIEST THAN MISTER HOULDSWORTH SHOULD NOT HAVE MET WITH THE PREFERMENT THAT THESE TWO FORMER NEIGHBOURS OF THEIRS HAD DONE
NO CONDITIONS BEING ATTACHED TO THIS APPOINTMENT IT SEEMED A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SO FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MOMENT SOME OF THE IMPLICITS WHICH I BELIEVE TO UNDERLIE HUMAN EFFORT
MISSUS THORNTON WAS NOT A WOMAN MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING HER QUICK JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION SERVED HER IN GOOD STEAD OF ANY LONG ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH HERSELF SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT NOTHING COULD STRENGTHEN FANNY TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS PATIENTLY
IT WILL DO YOU GOOD INSTEAD OF HARM
SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY
A SIGNAL WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD OFTEN TO BE REPEATED BEFORE ANY ONE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO THE HOUR OF THE DAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS AND ATTEND TO HIM NOW MISTER HALE LOITERED ABOUT THE GARDEN IF THE MORNING WAS FINE AND IF NOT
FANNY DON'T SPEAK SO OF YOUR BROTHER HE HAS GOOD REASONS OF SOME KIND OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NOT WISH US TO GO MAKE HASTE AND PUT YOUR THINGS ON
I KNOW A LITTLE PERSON WHO IS VERY UNHAPPY WITH HER FATHER SHE IS A RELATION OF YOURS PRINCESS MARY BOLKONSKAYA PRINCE VASILI DID NOT REPLY THOUGH WITH THE QUICKNESS OF MEMORY
THEN THE FREE WILL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO APPEAR TO US TO HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT MODE OF GOVERNMENT OR OCCASIONED THE MIGRATIONS CAN NO LONGER BE REGARDED AS THE CAUSE AND YET THE FORMER HISTORY CONTINUES TO BE STUDIED
LISTEN DEAR ANNETTE SAID THE PRINCE SUDDENLY TAKING ANNA PAVLOVNA'S HAND AND FOR SOME REASON DRAWING IT DOWNWARDS ARRANGE THAT AFFAIR FOR ME AND I SHALL ALWAYS BE YOUR MOST DEVOTED SLAVE
AND RESPECT MINGLED WITH SADNESS AND THIS OCCURRED EVERY TIME SHE MENTIONED HER ILLUSTRIOUS PATRONESS
THE SUBDUED SMILE WHICH THOUGH IT DID NOT SUIT HER FADED FEATURES ALWAYS PLAYED ROUND HER LIPS EXPRESSED AS IN A SPOILED CHILD A CONTINUAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER CHARMING DEFECT WHICH SHE NEITHER WISHED
AND TO YOU ALONE I CAN CONFESS THAT MY CHILDREN ARE THE BANE OF MY LIFE
AND ONE DAY I SURPRISED THE KEEPER OF IT WITH MY GERMAN I SPOKE ENTIRELY IN THAT LANGUAGE HE WAS GREATLY INTERESTED
THAT THE BIRD IS WAITING IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP ON ACCOUNT OF THE RAIN OF COURSE NO BIRD WOULD DO THAT BUT THEN YOU MUST STICK TO THE BOOK VERY WELL
I BEGIN TO CIPHER OUT THE GERMAN FOR THAT ANSWER I BEGIN AT THE WRONG END NECESSARILY FOR THAT IS THE GERMAN IDEA I SAY TO MYSELF
SIE MEANS YOU AND IT MEANS SHE AND IT MEANS HER AND IT MEANS IT AND IT MEANS THEY AND IT MEANS THEM
OF THE TEN PARTS OF SPEECH HE TURNS OVER THE PAGE AND READS LET THE PUPIL MAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS HE RUNS HIS EYE DOWN
WITH THE GERMANS IT IS DOUBTLESS THE MARK AND SIGN OF A PRACTICED PEN AND OF THE PRESENCE OF THAT SORT OF LUMINOUS INTELLECTUAL FOG WHICH STANDS FOR CLEARNESS AMONG THESE PEOPLE FOR SURELY IT IS NOT
VERY RARE POSSIBLY A UNIQUE AND WANTED TO ADD IT TO HIS MUSEUM IF HE HAD KNOWN WHAT IT HAD COST ME TO ACQUIRE MY ART
BUT AUSTRIA NEVER HAS WISHED AND DOES NOT WISH FOR WAR SHE IS BETRAYING US RUSSIA ALONE MUST SAVE EUROPE OUR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN RECOGNIZES HIS HIGH VOCATION AND WILL BE TRUE TO IT THAT IS THE ONE THING I HAVE FAITH IN
IN A KIND OF A GENERAL WAY ON THE GROUND IT IS THEN DEFINITELY LOCATED IT IS DOING SOMETHING THAT IS RESTING WHICH IS ONE OF THE GERMAN GRAMMAR'S IDEAS
BRUCE SURPRISED THE CAVALRY WITH DEEP PITS AND BEFORE THE ENGLISH COULD RECOVER FROM THIS
INTRUDES ITSELF INTO MY SENTENCE CLOTHED WITH AN AWFUL AND UNSUSPECTED POWER AND CRUMBLES THE GROUND FROM UNDER ME FOR INSTANCE MY BOOK INQUIRES AFTER A CERTAIN BIRD
I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO MEET THEM SAID THE PRINCE BUT TELL ME HE ADDED WITH STUDIED CARELESSNESS AS IF IT HAD ONLY JUST OCCURRED TO HIM THOUGH THE QUESTION HE WAS ABOUT TO ASK WAS THE CHIEF MOTIVE OF HIS VISIT
THOUGH THEY ARE USUALLY SO MILD AS TO COVER ONLY A FEW LINES AND THEREFORE WHEN YOU AT LAST GET DOWN TO THE VERB IT CARRIES SOME MEANING TO YOUR MIND
IT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTY AND ANNOYANCE FOR THREE OF OUR TEACHERS HAD DIED IN THE MEAN TIME A PERSON WHO HAS NOT STUDIED GERMAN CAN FORM NO IDEA
SHE WAS AS SHE SAID SUFFERING FROM
AND DELIVERED BY A SCARLET LIVERIED FOOTMAN THAT MORNING RAN AS FOLLOWS IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO COUNT OR PRINCE AND IF THE PROSPECT OF SPENDING AN EVENING WITH A POOR INVALID IS NOT TOO TERRIBLE
THE TEACHER LETS ME SOFTLY DOWN WITH THE REMARK THAT WHENEVER THE WORD
BUT LONGING TO LAY HER POOR ACHING HEAD YET ONCE AGAIN UPON THE BREAST OF HIM WHOM SHE LOVED MORE DEARLY THAN LIFE ITSELF PARTED HOWEVER IT IS NOT WELL
PHILIP THEN SUBPOENAED EDWARD AS DUKE OF GUIENNE TO SHOW CAUSE WHY HE SHOULD NOT PAY DAMAGES FOR THE LOSS OF THE NAVY WHICH COULD NOT BE REPLACED FOR LESS THAN TWENTY POUNDS AND FINALLY WHEEDLED EDWARD OUT OF THE DUCHY
WHEN HE STARTS OUT TO SAY THAT A MAN MET A COUNSELOR'S WIFE IN THE STREET AND THEN RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THIS SO SIMPLE UNDERTAKING HALTS THESE APPROACHING PEOPLE AND MAKES THEM STAND STILL
THEY ORGANIZED A SCHEME TO THROW OFF THE SPENCERS AND DETHRONE EDWARD THE THINKLESS
BUT THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS NOT EXTENDED TO ANYTHING BUT RAIN THERE ARE TEN PARTS OF SPEECH AND THEY ARE ALL TROUBLESOME AN AVERAGE SENTENCE IN A GERMAN NEWSPAPER
WITH THE FORCEPS AND THEN STAND THERE AND DRAWL THROUGH A TEDIOUS ANECDOTE BEFORE THEY GIVE THE DREADED JERK
SO FAR AS THE STEAMER IS CONCERNED BUT THE STATEMENT CAN DO NO HARM
WHERE HE DIED IN BOUNDLESS OBSCURITY IN TWELVE NINETY SEVEN BALIOL WAS SUCCEEDED BY THE BRAVE WILLIAM WALLACE WHO WON A GREAT BATTLE AT STIRLING BUT WAS AFTERWARDS DEFEATED ENTIRELY AT FALKIRK
AND THAT'S SOMETHING PERHAPS WE CAN FIND HIM FOR YOU FIRST WE'LL GO AND HAVE TEA WITH STRAWBERRY JAM
FROM MY CHILDHOOD I HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH LETTERS AND AS I WAS GIVEN TO BELIEVE THAT BY THEIR HELP A CLEAR AND CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THAT IS USEFUL IN LIFE MIGHT BE ACQUIRED I WAS ARDENTLY DESIROUS OF INSTRUCTION
AND IF THEY ERR IN THE SLIGHTEST PARTICULAR THEY SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO CENSURE BUT AS THIS TRACT IS PUT FORTH MERELY AS A HISTORY OR IF YOU WILL AS A TALE IN WHICH AMID SOME EXAMPLES WORTHY OF IMITATION
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD CRYING BITTERLY
AND I THOUGHT THAT IN ORDER COMPETENTLY TO UNDERTAKE THEIR EXAMINATION THERE WAS NEED OF SOME SPECIAL HELP FROM HEAVEN AND OF BEING MORE THAN MAN
PREFATORY NOTE BY THE AUTHOR IF THIS DISCOURSE APPEAR TOO LONG TO BE READ AT ONCE IT MAY BE DIVIDED INTO SIX PARTS
A SET OF BIG CHESS MEN CARVED OUT OF CORAL AND AMBER A WALKING STICK WHICH HAD A SWORD INSIDE
THAN THEY ALREADY POSSESS AND IN THIS IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT ALL ARE MISTAKEN THE CONVICTION IS RATHER TO BE HELD AS TESTIFYING THAT THE POWER OF JUDGING ARIGHT AND OF DISTINGUISHING TRUTH FROM ERROR
SH THE DOCTOR WHISPERED THAT IS THE PUSHMI PULLYU DON'T LET HIM SEE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM HE GETS SO DREADFULLY EMBARRASSED TELL ME HOW DID YOU COME TO BE LOCKED UP IN THAT LITTLE ROOM
I WAS THUS LED TO TAKE THE LIBERTY OF JUDGING OF ALL OTHER MEN BY MYSELF AND OF CONCLUDING THAT THERE WAS NO SCIENCE IN EXISTENCE THAT WAS OF SUCH A NATURE AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN GIVEN TO BELIEVE I STILL CONTINUED HOWEVER
AND BE PREVENTED FROM THINKING THAT EVERYTHING CONTRARY TO OUR CUSTOMS IS RIDICULOUS AND IRRATIONAL A CONCLUSION USUALLY COME TO BY THOSE WHOSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN TOO MUCH TIME IS OCCUPIED IN TRAVELING
THAT IT IS USEFUL TO BESTOW SOME ATTENTION UPON ALL EVEN UPON THOSE ABOUNDING THE MOST IN SUPERSTITION AND ERROR THAT WE MAY BE IN A POSITION TO DETERMINE THEIR REAL VALUE AND GUARD AGAINST BEING DECEIVED
OF PHILOSOPHY I WILL SAY NOTHING EXCEPT THAT WHEN I SAW THAT IT HAD BEEN CULTIVATED FOR MANY AGES BY THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN AND THAT YET THERE IS NOT A SINGLE MATTER WITHIN ITS SPHERE WHICH IS NOT STILL IN DISPUTE
AND CANNOT HELP ENTERTAINING SUCH EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE AS TO BELIEVE THAT IF AMONG THE OCCUPATIONS OF MEN AS MEN THERE IS ANY ONE REALLY EXCELLENT AND IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WHICH I HAVE CHOSEN AFTER ALL IT IS POSSIBLE I MAY BE MISTAKEN
I GRADUALLY EXTRICATED MYSELF FROM MANY ERRORS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DARKEN OUR NATURAL INTELLIGENCE AND INCAPACITATE US IN GREAT MEASURE FROM LISTENING TO REASON BUT AFTER I HAD BEEN OCCUPIED SEVERAL YEARS IN THUS STUDYING THE BOOK OF THE WORLD
ALTHOUGH THERE WERE AMONG THEM SOME WHO WERE ALREADY MARKED OUT TO FILL THE PLACES OF OUR INSTRUCTORS AND IN FINE OUR AGE APPEARED TO ME AS FLOURISHING AND AS FERTILE IN POWERFUL MINDS AS ANY PRECEDING ONE
THAN THAT THEY FOSTER HIS VANITY THE BETTER THE MORE REMOTE THEY ARE FROM COMMON SENSE REQUIRING AS THEY MUST IN THIS CASE THE EXERCISE OF GREATER INGENUITY AND ART TO RENDER THEM PROBABLE IN ADDITION
THE ROOM WAS QUITE SMALL NO WINDOW THE CEILING LOW FOR FURNITURE THERE WAS ONLY ONE LITTLE STOOL
TAKING A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AND JAM WHAT ARE THOSE FUNNY CLICKING NOISES YOU ARE MAKING WITH YOUR TONGUE ASKED THE BOY OH I JUST SAID A COUPLE OF WORDS IN DUCK LANGUAGE THE DOCTOR ANSWERED
SO THEY ALL CAME BACK TO THE DOOR AND JIP PEERED THROUGH THE KEY HOLE BUT SOMETHING HAD BEEN STOOD AGAINST THE WALL ON THE INSIDE AND HE COULD SEE NOTHING WHILE THEY WERE STANDING AROUND WONDERING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO THE OWL
HE ISN'T DROWNED SAID THE PORPOISES IF HE WERE WE WOULD BE SURE TO HAVE HEARD OF IT FROM THE DEEP SEA DECAPODS WE HEAR ALL THE SALT WATER NEWS THE SHELL FISH CALL US THE OCEAN GOSSIPS NO TELL THE LITTLE BOY WE ARE SORRY WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE HIS UNCLE IS
WHILE BUSIED ONLY IN CONSIDERING THE MANNERS OF OTHER MEN I FOUND HERE TOO SCARCE ANY GROUND FOR SETTLED CONVICTION AND REMARKED HARDLY LESS CONTRADICTION AMONG THEM THAN IN THE OPINIONS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND IN ESSAYING TO GATHER SOME EXPERIENCE I AT LENGTH RESOLVED TO MAKE MYSELF AN OBJECT OF STUDY AND TO EMPLOY ALL THE POWERS OF MY MIND IN CHOOSING THE PATHS I OUGHT TO FOLLOW
I ENTIRELY ABANDONED THE STUDY OF LETTERS AND RESOLVED NO LONGER TO SEEK ANY OTHER SCIENCE THAN THE KNOWLEDGE OF MYSELF OR OF THE GREAT BOOK OF THE WORLD I SPENT THE REMAINDER OF MY YOUTH IN TRAVELING IN VISITING COURTS AND ARMIES
EVERYTHING MAKES SOME NOISE IF YOUR EARS ARE ONLY SHARP ENOUGH TO CATCH IT BATS CAN HEAR A MOLE WALKING IN HIS TUNNEL UNDER THE EARTH
HE SAID NOT LIKE A PIRATE COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE MY UNCLE IS I AM AFRAID I CAN'T SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM LAST IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY SAID THE BOY
LIFT ME UP AND LET ME LISTEN AT THE KEY HOLE AND I'LL SOON TELL YOU
THERE WILL BE FOUND PERHAPS AS MANY MORE WHICH IT WERE ADVISABLE NOT TO FOLLOW I HOPE IT WILL PROVE USEFUL TO SOME WITHOUT BEING HURTFUL TO ANY AND THAT MY OPENNESS WILL FIND SOME FAVOR WITH ALL
IF READ WITH DISCRETION AID IN FORMING THE JUDGMENT THAT THE PERUSAL OF ALL EXCELLENT BOOKS IS AS IT WERE TO INTERVIEW WITH THE NOBLEST MEN OF PAST AGES WHO HAVE WRITTEN THEM AND EVEN A STUDIED INTERVIEW IN WHICH ARE DISCOVERED TO US
SIX WINE GLASSES WITH TURQUOISE AND SILVER ROUND THE RIMS AND A LOVELY GREAT SUGAR BOWL MADE OF MOTHER O PEARL BUT NOWHERE IN THE WHOLE BOAT COULD THEY FIND A KEY TO FIT THAT LOCK
BUT THAT YOUNG AND STRONG MEN CAN FIND PLENTY IN THE MOUNTAINS THEREFORE WHY SHOULD THEY GO TO THE HOT PLAINS TO BE PENNED UP LIKE HORSES AND CATTLE MY HEART HAS BEEN SORE SINCE THAT TALK
WITHOUT BEING DISTRACTED OR DIVERTED BY HIS CARNAL AFFECTIONS AND DEPRAVED NATURE THE MONK THEN SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK IN YOUR CONSCIENCE IS MEANT AND SIGNIFIED BY THIS RIDDLE WHAT
THIS LED TO ANOTHER YOSEMITE EXPEDITION A DETACHMENT OF REGULAR SOLDIERS FROM FORT MILLER UNDER LIEUTENANT MOORE U S A WAS AT ONCE DISPATCHED TO CAPTURE OR PUNISH THE MURDERERS
DESCRIBED IT IN ARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY A GOOD ARTIST WHO WAS TAKEN INTO THE VALLEY BY HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
BUSIED HERSELF MOST ABOUT IT WHEN LITTLE VANKA'S MOTHER PELAGUEYA WAS STILL ALIVE AND WAS SERVANT WOMAN IN THE HOUSE OLGA IGNATYEVNA USED TO STUFF HIM WITH SUGAR CANDY AND HAVING NOTHING TO DO
HE ASKS HOLDING OUT HIS SNUFF BOX TO THE WOMEN THE WOMEN TAKE A PINCH OF SNUFF AND SNEEZE THE OLD MAN GOES INTO INDESCRIBABLE ECSTASIES BREAKS INTO LOUD LAUGHTER AND CRIES
BUT I HAVE NO BOOTS AND I WAS AFRAID OF THE FROST AND WHEN I GROW UP I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU
IN DARK AND OBSCURE TERMS THE SUBORNERS OF MEN ARE THE MAKERS OF MATCHES WHICH ARE COMMONLY FRIENDS AFTER THE TWO CHASES ARE MADE HE THAT WAS IN THE UPPER END OF THE TENNIS COURT GOETH OUT
HOME TO OUR VILLAGE I CAN'T BEAR THIS ANY MORE I BOW TO THE GROUND TO YOU AND WILL PRAY TO GOD FOR EVER AND EVER TAKE ME FROM HERE OR I SHALL DIE
HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS GRANDFATHER ALWAYS WENT TO THE FOREST FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND TOOK HIS GRANDSON WITH HIM WHAT HAPPY TIMES THE FROST CRACKLED HIS GRANDFATHER CRACKLED AND AS THEY BOTH DID
POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
TAKE A GOLDEN WALNUT AND HIDE IT IN MY GREEN BOX ASK THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA FOR IT SAY IT'S FOR VANKA VANKA SIGHED CONVULSIVELY AND AGAIN STARED AT THE WINDOW
AND TO THE SOUND OF BELLS VANKA RAN TO THE FIRST POST BOX AND SLIPPED HIS PRECIOUS LETTER INTO THE SLIT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LULLED BY HOPE HE WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY
THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS ERECTED IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AND WAS KEPT AS A HOTEL THE NEXT YEAR BY G A HITE AND LATER BY J H NEAL AND S M CUNNINGHAM
O HE IS WORTHY PRAISE THAT SHRINKETH NOT NO SOONER WAS THIS ENIGMATICAL MONUMENT READ OVER BUT GARGANTUA FETCHING A VERY DEEP SIGH SAID UNTO THOSE THAT STOOD BY
ALL FOR SALE AND FOR EVERY KIND OF FISH AWFULLY CONVENIENT AND THERE WAS ONE HOOK WHICH WOULD CATCH A SHEAT FISH WEIGHING A POUND AND THERE ARE SHOPS WITH GUNS LIKE THE MASTER'S AND I AM SURE THEY MUST COST ONE HUNDRED RUBLES EACH
TENAYA INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF TAKING ALL THE INDIANS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN PLAIN MY PEOPLE
ALWAYS SMILING AND BLEAR EYED ALL DAY HE SLEPT IN THE SERVANTS KITCHEN OR TRIFLED WITH THE COOKS
A SECOND EXPEDITION WAS MADE IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR BOLING WHEN THE VALLEY WAS ENTERED NO INDIANS WERE SEEN BUT THE MANY WIGWAMS WITH SMOLDERING FIRES
THROUGH AN INTERPRETER EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY LATER
AFTER WAITING STILL ANOTHER DAY THE EXPEDITION STARTED FOR THE VALLEY WHEN TENAYA WAS QUESTIONED AS TO THE ROUTE AND DISTANCE HE SAID THAT THE SNOW WAS SO DEEP THAT THE HORSES COULD NOT GO THROUGH IT
THE CHILDREN DON'T COME ROUND AT CHRISTMAS WITH A STAR NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO SING IN THE CHOIR
AND VIVIDLY PICTURED TO HIMSELF HIS GRANDFATHER
WHEN THE CAPTIVES WERE ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF THE TWO WHITE MEN THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD KILLED THEM TO PREVENT WHITE MEN FROM COMING TO THEIR VALLEY DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
HIS CUDGEL WILL BE HANGING FROM HIS BELT HE WILL BE HUGGING HIMSELF WITH COLD GIVING A LITTLE DRY OLD MAN'S COUGH AND AT TIMES PINCHING A SERVANT GIRL OR A COOK WON'T WE TAKE SOME SNUFF
INSISTING THAT SHE SHALL SHARE OUR DELIGHT IN THEM AND THERE ARE BOOKS EQUALLY DEAR TO US OF WHICH WE SAY NOTHING FEARING LEST THE PRAISE OF OTHERS
WHICH SOME HAVE CLAIMED FOR HIM
THEY STOLE A NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES FROM THEIR ENTERTAINERS AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
TO THE MAJOR SAVAGE FIRMLY SAID YOUR PEOPLE MUST GO TO THE COMMISSIONERS IF THEY DO NOT YOUR YOUNG MEN WILL AGAIN STEAL HORSES AND KILL AND PLUNDER THE WHITES
ALMOST AS SOON AS HE WAS DISCOVERABLE LET US SPARE A MOMENT AND A TEAR FOR THOSE GOLDEN DAYS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WHEN THERE WERE FIVE LEISURELY PAPERS OF AN EVENING
THEN SPREADING A CRUMPLED SHEET OF PAPER IN FRONT OF HIM HE BEGAN TO WRITE BEFORE HOWEVER DECIDING TO MAKE THE FIRST LETTER HE LOOKED FURTIVELY AT THE DOOR AND AT THE WINDOW GLANCED SEVERAL TIMES AT THE SOMBRE IKON
AS SHE SPOKE SHE TOLD EUMAEUS TO SET THE BOW AND THE PIECES OF IRON BEFORE THE SUITORS AND EUMAEUS WEPT AS HE TOOK THEM TO DO AS SHE HAD BIDDEN HIM HARD BY THE STOCKMAN WEPT ALSO
OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE STILL FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES THEY WERE BY FAR THE MOST VALIANT FOR THE OTHERS HAD ALREADY FALLEN UNDER THE ARROWS OF ULYSSES
WERE SO SHORTLY ABOUT TO TASTE WERE ALL INSIDE THE QUIVER HE LAID IT ON THE CENTRE PIECE OF THE BOW AND DREW THE NOTCH OF THE ARROW
MY FRIENDS THIS MAN WILL GIVE US NO QUARTER
TELEMACHUS DID AS HIS FATHER SAID AND WENT OFF TO THE STORE ROOM WHERE THE ARMOUR WAS KEPT HE CHOSE FOUR SHIELDS EIGHT SPEARS AND FOUR BRASS HELMETS WITH HORSE HAIR PLUMES HE BROUGHT THEM WITH ALL SPEED TO HIS FATHER
THEN THEY DRAGGED HIM THROUGH THE DOORWAY OUT OF THE HOUSE SO HE WENT AWAY CRAZED AND BORE THE BURDEN OF HIS CRIME BEREFT OF UNDERSTANDING HENCEFORTH THEREFORE THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN MANKIND AND THE CENTAURS
BUT THE SWINEHERD SAW HIM AND SAID TO ULYSSES WHO WAS BESIDE HIM ULYSSES
FOR HIS FATHER AND THE OTHER CHIEFTAINS SENT HIM ON A MISSION TO RECOVER THEM
STAY YOUR HAND THEREFORE AND TELL YOUR FATHER OR HE WILL KILL ME IN HIS RAGE AGAINST THE SUITORS FOR HAVING WASTED HIS SUBSTANCE AND BEEN SO FOOLISHLY DISRESPECTFUL TO YOURSELF ULYSSES SMILED AT HIM AND ANSWERED
NOT IF I CAN WIN THE PRIZES WHICH MY FATHER WON BEFORE ME AS HE SPOKE HE SPRANG FROM HIS SEAT THREW HIS CRIMSON CLOAK FROM HIM
SO SHE FLEW UP TO ONE OF THE RAFTERS IN THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER AND SAT UPON IT IN THE FORM OF A SWALLOW MEANWHILE
FOLLOWING TELEMACHUS SHE FOUND ULYSSES AMONG THE CORPSES BESPATTERED WITH BLOOD AND FILTH LIKE A LION THAT HAS JUST BEEN DEVOURING AN OX AND HIS BREAST AND BOTH HIS CHEEKS ARE ALL BLOODY
AND WAS TURNING IT EVERY WAY ABOUT AND PROVING IT ALL OVER TO SEE WHETHER THE WORMS HAD BEEN EATING INTO ITS TWO HORNS DURING HIS ABSENCE THEN WOULD ONE TURN TOWARDS HIS NEIGHBOUR SAYING
FOR THE SWINEHERD AND THE STOCKMAN FOR WE HAD BETTER BE ARMED RUN AND FETCH THEM ANSWERED ULYSSES WHILE MY ARROWS HOLD OUT OR WHEN I AM ALONE THEY MAY GET ME AWAY FROM THE DOOR
STRUNG IT AS EASILY AS A SKILLED BARD STRINGS A NEW PEG OF HIS LYRE AND MAKES THE TWISTED GUT FAST AT BOTH ENDS THEN HE TOOK IT IN HIS RIGHT HAND TO PROVE THE STRING AND IT SANG SWEETLY UNDER HIS TOUCH
AND REQUITE YOUR KINDNESSES CONFERRED UPON HIM BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE HIM FULL VICTORY AS YET FOR SHE WISHED STILL FURTHER TO PROVE HIS OWN PROWESS AND THAT OF HIS BRAVE SON
FOR SHE SAW THAT A GREAT DEED HAD BEEN DONE BUT ULYSSES CHECKED HER OLD WOMAN SAID HE REJOICE IN SILENCE RESTRAIN YOURSELF AND DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISE ABOUT IT IT IS AN UNHOLY THING
GO THEN WITHIN THE HOUSE AND BUSY YOURSELF WITH YOUR DAILY DUTIES YOUR LOOM YOUR DISTAFF AND THE ORDERING OF YOUR SERVANTS THIS BOW IS A MAN'S MATTER AND MINE ABOVE ALL OTHERS FOR IT IS I WHO AM MASTER HERE
WHO KILLS EVERY ONE THAT COMES NEAR HIM YOU WILL NEVER GET AWAY ALIVE SO DRINK AND KEEP QUIET WITHOUT GETTING INTO A QUARREL WITH MEN YOUNGER THAN YOURSELF PENELOPE THEN SPOKE TO HIM
THIS IS WHAT WILL BE SAID AND IT WILL BE A SCANDAL AGAINST US EURYMACHUS PENELOPE ANSWERED PEOPLE WHO PERSIST IN EATING UP THE ESTATE OF A GREAT CHIEFTAIN
BEARING A CHEST THAT CONTAINED MUCH IRON AND BRONZE WHICH HER HUSBAND HAD WON AS PRIZES WHEN SHE REACHED THE SUITORS SHE STOOD BY ONE OF THE BEARING POSTS SUPPORTING THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER
HE SAW FOR CERTAIN WHAT MIND THEY WERE OF ULYSSES SAID IT IS I ULYSSES WHO AM HERE I HAVE SUFFERED MUCH BUT AT LAST IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR I AM COME BACK TO MY OWN COUNTRY
HAS NOT VOUCHSAFED IT TO HIM HE WANTED TO KILL YOUR SON AND TO BE CHIEF MAN IN ITHACA NOW THEREFORE THAT HE HAS MET THE DEATH WHICH WAS HIS DUE SPARE THE LIVES OF YOUR PEOPLE
CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD TAKE ME HOME WITH HIM
AND PUT IT OUT OF DOORS THEN WHEN THEY HAD MADE THE WHOLE PLACE QUITE CLEAN AND ORDERLY
EITHER IN WORD OR DEED AND I TRIED TO STOP THE OTHERS I SAW THEM BUT THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN AND NOW THEY ARE PAYING FOR THEIR FOLLY I WAS THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST IF YOU KILL ME
NOT A MAN OF YOU SHALL THEIR HEARTS SANK AS THEY HEARD HIM
WHO WAS WARMING IT BY THE FIRE BUT EVEN SO HE COULD NOT STRING IT AND HE WAS GREATLY GRIEVED HE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH AND SAID
AND SEND HIS ARROW THROUGH EACH ONE OF TWELVE AXES HIM WILL I FOLLOW AND QUIT THIS HOUSE OF MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SO GOODLY AND SO ABOUNDING IN WEALTH BUT EVEN SO I DOUBT NOT THAT I SHALL REMEMBER IT IN MY DREAMS
SON OF DAMASTOR EURYNOMUS AMPHIMEDON DEMOPTOLEMUS PISANDER AND POLYBUS SON OF POLYCTOR BORE THE BRUNT OF THE FIGHT UPON THE SUITORS SIDE
HELP WOULD COME AT ONCE AND WE SHOULD SOON MAKE AN END OF THIS MAN AND HIS SHOOTING THIS MAY NOT BE AGELAUS ANSWERED MELANTHIUS THE MOUTH OF THE NARROW PASSAGE IS DANGEROUSLY NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE OUTER COURT
WITH LIGHT AND LANGUOR AND LITTLE SIGHS JUST SO SUBTLY HE SCARCELY KNOWS LAUGHING LIGHTNING COLOR OF ROSE DO YOU LIKE ME
QUAINT AND MEDITATIVE CHARM METAMORPHOSED THE STRAY TELEGRAPH BOY INTO A PUCK LIKE CREATURE OF DELIGHTFUL ORIGINALITY AT FIRST THIS QUALITY OF HERS SOMEHOW IRRITATED AMORY HE CONSIDERED HIS OWN UNIQUENESS SUFFICIENT AND IT
WAS IN A MISERABLE LANE OF HOVELS
DO YOU KNOW IT RAN THAT YOUR THIRD COUSIN CLARA PAGE WIDOWED SIX MONTHS AND VERY POOR IS LIVING IN PHILADELPHIA I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER MET HER BUT I WISH AS A FAVOR TO ME YOU'D GO TO SEE HER
AND ONE OF THE FEW GOOD PEOPLE WHO EVER INTERESTED HIM SHE MADE HER GOODNESS SUCH AN ASSET AMORY HAD DECIDED THAT MOST GOOD PEOPLE EITHER DRAGGED THEIRS AFTER THEM AS A LIABILITY OR ELSE DISTORTED IT TO
SMILING A REPERTOIRE WHILE THE POOR PLAY REACHED ME AS A FAINT RIPPLE REACHES SHORE YAWNING AND WONDERING AN EVENING THROUGH I WATCH ALONE AND CHATTERINGS OF COURSE SPOIL THE ONE SCENE WHICH
BEEN IN HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY FOR YEARS AN ELDERLY AUNT WHO OBJECTED TO HAVING IT SOLD HAD PUT TEN YEARS TAXES WITH A LAWYER AND PRANCED OFF TO HONOLULU LEAVING CLARA TO STRUGGLE WITH THE HEATING PROBLEM AS BEST SHE COULD
SOMEHOW DID HAVE CHARMS YOU WEPT A BIT AND I GREW SAD FOR YOU RIGHT HERE WHERE MISTER X DEFENDS DIVORCE AND WHAT'S HER NAME FALLS FAINTING IN HIS ARMS STILL CALM
AND I LOVE YOU ANY LATENT GREATNESS THAT I'VE GOT IS OH I CAN'T TALK BUT CLARA IF I COME BACK IN TWO YEARS IN A POSITION TO MARRY YOU SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NO SHE SAID I'D NEVER MARRY AGAIN
FORGETTING HOW DIFFERENT SHE WAS FROM HIM AT ANY RATE CLARA TOLD AMORY MUCH ABOUT HERSELF THAT EVENING SHE HAD HAD A HARRIED LIFE FROM SIXTEEN ON AND HER EDUCATION HAD STOPPED SHARPLY WITH HER LEISURE
YOU ARE REMARKABLE AREN'T YOU
THROUGH EARLY MARCH HE TOOK TO GOING TO PHILADELPHIA FOR WEEK ENDS ALMOST ALWAYS THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE THERE AND SHE SEEMED NOT ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM ALONE
OH DON'T TRY TO ACT BURNE THE MYSTIC TO ME AMORY LOOKED UP INNOCENTLY WHAT WHAT MIMICKED ALEC ARE YOU TRYING TO READ YOURSELF INTO A RHAPSODY WITH LET'S SEE THE BOOK
INTO THE QUIET FACES AT ITS EDGE SO SHE CAST HER LIGHTS AND SHADOWS AROUND THE ROOMS THAT HELD HER
QUITE INVOLUNTARILY AND THE PEOPLE TURNED AND PEERED AND THE PRIEST PAUSED IN HIS SERMON AND CLARA AND AMORY TURNED TO FIERY RED THAT WAS THE LAST SUNDAY THEY HAD FOR HE SPOILED IT ALL THAT NIGHT
DON'T MAKE ME OUT SUCH A LIGHT WEIGHT CLARA YOU ARE DEPRESSING SOMETIMES YOU'RE NOT A LIGHT WEIGHT OF ALL THINGS SHE SAID INTENTLY TAKING HIS ARM AND OPENING WIDE HER EYES
AMORY SIGHED AND DECIDED TO GO AS A FAVOR CLARA SHE WAS IMMEMORIAL
TAKE A STICK ANSWERED ALEC WITH PONDEROUS REVERENCE ONE ABOUT THE LENGTH OF A BROOM HANDLE
THEY WALKED ALONG AND HE REALIZED SLOWLY HOW MUCH SHE HAD TOLD HIM NEVER IN LOVE SHE SEEMED SUDDENLY A DAUGHTER OF LIGHT ALONE
AMORY BEGAN ALEC WAVED HIM INTO SILENCE OF COURSE YOU NEVER LOOK YOU STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR AND BEFORE HE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO MAKE A SUDDEN LEAP FOR THE BED NEVER WALK NEAR THE BED
SHE WAS VERY DEVOUT ALWAYS HAD BEEN AND GOD KNOWS WHAT HEIGHTS SHE ATTAINED AND WHAT STRENGTH SHE DREW DOWN TO HERSELF WHEN SHE KNELT AND BENT HER GOLDEN HAIR INTO THE STAINED GLASS LIGHT
DEEPEST OF ALL IN HER PERSONALITY WAS THE GOLDEN RADIANCE THAT SHE DIFFUSED AROUND HER
BROWSING IN HER LIBRARY AMORY FOUND A TATTERED GRAY BOOK OUT OF WHICH FELL A YELLOW SHEET
A GHOST CAN NEVER GET YOU IN A BEDROOM GO ON S'POSE YOU THINK THERE'S MAYBE A GHOST IN YOUR BEDROOM WHAT MEASURES DO YOU TAKE ON GETTING HOME AT NIGHT DEMANDED AMORY INTERESTED
OFTEN AMORY MET WIVES WHOM HE HAD KNOWN AS DEBUTANTES AND LOOKING INTENTLY AT THEM IMAGINED THAT HE FOUND SOMETHING IN THEIR FACES WHICH SAID OH IF I COULD ONLY HAVE GOTTEN YOU OH THE ENORMOUS CONCEIT OF THE MAN
HE SNATCHED IT REGARDED IT DERISIVELY WELL SAID AMORY A LITTLE STIFFLY THE LIFE OF SAINT TERESA READ ALEC ALOUD
IT'S UNFORTUNATE IF I HAPPEN TO LOOK LIKE WHAT PLEASED SOME SOPPY OLD GREEK SCULPTOR BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY FACE I'D BE A QUIET NUN IN THE CONVENT WITHOUT
THOUGH SHE WAS WISE ENOUGH NEVER TO STULTIFY HERSELF WITH SUCH HOUSEHOLD ARTS AS KNITTING AND EMBROIDERY YET IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD PICK UP A BOOK AND LET HER IMAGINATION ROVE AS A FORMLESS CLOUD WITH THE WIND
GEE GIRLS AIN'T SHE SOME KID AND CLARA BEAMED ON ALL ALIKE AMORY BELIEVED THAT TRADESPEOPLE GAVE HER DISCOUNTS SOMETIMES TO HER KNOWLEDGE AND SOMETIMES WITHOUT IT HE KNEW SHE DRESSED VERY WELL
THAT'S THE ANCIENT CELTIC SCHOOL SAID TOM GRAVELY YES BUT THEY USUALLY PRAY FIRST
SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH SUCH A STARTLED FACE THAT HE ASKED HER THE MATTER NOTHING SHE SAID SLOWLY ONLY THIS FIVE MEN HAVE SAID THAT TO ME BEFORE AND IT FRIGHTENS ME
WHERE WITH AMAZING CHEMISTRY TOM TOWERS COMPOUNDED THUNDERBOLTS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL THAT IS EVIL AND FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THIS AND OTHER HEMISPHERES WHO HAS NOT HEARD OF MOUNT OLYMPUS
IT WAS HERE THAT TOM TOWERS LIVED AND CULTIVATED WITH EMINENT SUCCESS THE TENTH MUSE WHO NOW GOVERNS THE PERIODICAL PRESS BUT LET IT NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT HIS CHAMBERS WERE SUCH
LOOK AT OUR GENERALS WHAT FAULTS THEY MAKE AT OUR ADMIRALS HOW INACTIVE THEY ARE WHAT MONEY HONESTY AND SCIENCE CAN DO IS DONE AND YET HOW BADLY ARE OUR TROOPS BROUGHT TOGETHER FED CONVEYED
OUR MODERN ARTISTS WHOM WE STYLE PRE RAPHAELITES HAVE DELIGHTED TO GO BACK NOT ONLY TO THE FINISH AND PECULIAR MANNER BUT ALSO TO THE SUBJECTS OF THE EARLY PAINTERS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE THEM TOO MUCH PRAISE
CLOSE TO THE DENSEST THRONG OF MEN BUT PARTAKING NEITHER OF THE NOISE NOR THE CROWD A SMALL SECLUDED DREARY SPOT TENANTED ONE WOULD SAY BY QUITE UNAMBITIOUS PEOPLE AT THE EASIEST RENTS
NO ONE COULD INSULT HIM NO ONE COULD INQUIRE INTO HIM HE COULD SPEAK OUT WITHERING WORDS AND NO ONE COULD ANSWER HIM MINISTERS COURTED HIM THOUGH PERHAPS THEY KNEW NOT HIS NAME BISHOPS FEARED HIM
HERE ON THE CHOICEST SPOT OF THIS CHOICE GROUND STANDS A LOFTY ROW OF CHAMBERS LOOKING OBLIQUELY UPON THE SULLIED THAMES
BUT WHEN ALL IS DONE THE JUPITER DECLARES THAT ALL IS NAUGHT WHY SHOULD WE LOOK TO LORD JOHN RUSSELL WHY SHOULD WE REGARD PALMERSTON AND GLADSTONE WHEN TOM TOWERS WITHOUT A STRUGGLE CAN PUT US RIGHT
HE WOULD HARDLY HAVE LEFT HIS PRESENT CAREER IT IS TRUE HE WORE NO ERMINE BORE NO OUTWARD MARKS OF A WORLD'S RESPECT BUT WITH WHAT A LOAD OF INWARD IMPORTANCE WAS HE CHARGED
WERE IT NOT WELL FOR US IN OUR IGNORANCE THAT WE CONFIDED ALL THINGS TO THE JUPITER WOULD IT NOT BE WISE IN US TO ABANDON USELESS TALKING IDLE THINKING AND PROFITLESS LABOUR
WHERE THE WILDEST WORSHIPPER OF BACCHUS NEVER FORGOT THE DIGNITY OF THE GOD WHOM HE ADORED WHERE CAN RETIREMENT BE SO COMPLETE AS HERE WHERE CAN YOU BE SO SURE OF ALL THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY
NO VALETUDINARIAN NEIGHBOUR WILL COMPLAIN OF LATE HOURS IF YOU LOVE BOOKS TO WHAT PLACE ARE BOOKS SO SUITABLE THE WHOLE SPOT IS REDOLENT OF TYPOGRAPHY
JUDGES DOUBTED THEIR OWN VERDICTS UNLESS HE CONFIRMED THEM AND GENERALS IN THEIR COUNCILS OF WAR DID NOT CONSIDER MORE DEEPLY WHAT THE ENEMY WOULD DO THAN WHAT THE JUPITER WOULD SAY TOM TOWERS NEVER BOASTED OF THE JUPITER
WITH VERDICTS FROM JUDICIAL BENCH GIVEN AFTER MUCH DELAY WITH DOUBTFUL LAWS AND THE FALLIBLE ATTEMPTS OF HUMANITY
RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS WITH SURPRISE AND EVIDENT MISGIVING HOWEVER THEY COULD ONLY OBEY AND MUTTER SOMETHING OF THEIR SORROW THAT SUCH HEAVY COSTS SHOULD ONLY FALL UPON THEIR OWN EMPLOYER
BUT HE HAD NEVER YET BY WORD OR SIGN ATTEMPTED TO INFLUENCE THE SLIGHTEST WORD OF HIS UNERRING FRIEND ON SUCH A COURSE WAS HE NOW INTENT AND NOT WITHOUT MUCH INWARD PALPITATION
AN OLD OFFICE TABLE COVERED WITH DUSTY PAPERS WHICH ARE NOT MOVED ONCE IN SIX MONTHS AND AN OLDER PEMBROKE BROTHER WITH RICKETY LEGS FOR ALL DAILY USES A DESPATCHER FOR THE PREPARATION OF LOBSTERS AND COFFEE
CHAPTER FOURTEEN MOUNT OLYMPUS WRETCHED IN SPIRIT GROANING UNDER THE FEELING OF INSULT SELF CONDEMNING AND ILL SATISFIED IN EVERY WAY BOLD RETURNED TO HIS LONDON LODGINGS
TO WHOM WE LOOK FOR GUIDANCE IN OUR DIFFICULTIES BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO THE WRITERS OF THE JUPITER THEY HOLD COUNCIL TOGETHER AND WITH ANXIOUS THOUGHT PAINFULLY ELABORATE THEIR COUNTRY'S GOOD
AND IS STILL LOOKING FROM HOUR TO HOUR GIVES US AN IDEA OF PAIN WITHOUT GRACE AND ABSTRACTION WITHOUT A CAUSE IT WAS EASY FROM HIS ROOMS TO SEE THAT TOM TOWERS WAS A SYBARITE THOUGH BY NO MEANS AN IDLE ONE
THOUGH SCORNED MEN BORN OF BRITISH MOTHERS AND NURSED ON ENGLISH MILK WHO SCRUPLE NOT TO SAY THAT MOUNT OLYMPUS HAS ITS PRICE THAT TOM TOWERS CAN BE BOUGHT FOR GOLD SUCH IS MOUNT OLYMPUS
FROM HERE ISSUE THE ONLY KNOWN INFALLIBLE BULLS FOR THE GUIDANCE OF BRITISH SOULS AND BODIES THIS LITTLE COURT IS THE VATICAN OF ENGLAND HERE REIGNS A POPE SELF NOMINATED SELF CONSECRATED
HOW HE COULD SMITE THE LOUDEST OF THEM WERE IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO RAISE HIS PEN FOR SUCH A PURPOSE HE LOVED TO WATCH THE GREAT MEN OF WHOM HE DAILY WROTE AND FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE WAS GREATER THAN ANY OF THEM
ALAS ALAS TOM TOWERS AND HE ALONE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT WHY OH WHY YE EARTHLY MINISTERS WHY HAVE YE NOT FOLLOWED MORE CLOSELY THIS HEAVEN SENT MESSENGER THAT IS AMONG US
EACH OF WHICH WAS FURNISHED IF NOT WITH THE SPLENDOUR WITH PROBABLY MORE THAN THE COMFORT OF STAFFORD HOUSE EVERY ADDITION THAT SCIENCE AND ART HAVE LATELY MADE TO THE LUXURIES OF MODERN LIFE WAS TO BE FOUND THERE
THEN TOM TOWERS WAS STRUGGLING HARD TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF AS A BRIEFLESS BARRISTER BY SHORTHAND REPORTING FOR ANY OF THE PAPERS THAT WOULD ENGAGE HIM THEN HE HAD NOT DARED TO DREAM OF WRITING LEADERS FOR THE JUPITER
DOES HE NOT KNOW WATCH AND CHRONICLE THE DOINGS OF EVERYONE FROM A BISHOPRIC IN NEW ZEALAND TO AN UNFORTUNATE DIRECTOR OF A NORTH WEST PASSAGE IS HE NOT THE ONLY FIT JUDGE OF CAPABILITY
INDEED AS MISTER WILLIAM H WHITMORE POINTS OUT IN HIS CLEVER MONOGRAPH UPON MOTHER GOOSE ALBANY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER IN SEVENTEEN NINETEEN
SO YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR SHEEP DEARIE SHE SAID IN HER CRACKED VOICE YES REPLIED LITTLE BO PEEP WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING A SOB BUT LOOK MOTHER THEY VE ALL LEFT THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM WHY SO THEY HAVE EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN
NOR ARE THEY EVER RECALLED WITHOUT BRINGING BACK WITH THEM MYRIADS OF SLUMBERING FEELINGS AND HALF FORGOTTEN IMAGES WE HEAR THE SWEET LOW VOICE OF THE MOTHER SINGING SOFT LULLABIES TO HER DARLING
L FRANK BAUM CHICAGO ILLINOIS
AND IN DUE TIME GAVE BIRTH TO A SON LIKE MOST MOTHERS IN LAW IN OUR DAY THE IMPORTANCE OF MISSUS GOOSE INCREASED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF HER GRANDCHILD AND POOR MISTER FLEET HALF DISTRACTED WITH HER ENDLESS NURSERY DITTIES FINDING ALL OTHER MEANS FAIL
IS OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS BOSTON'S THERE LIVED IN A TOWN IN SUSSEX ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN O FOUR AN OLD WOMAN NAMED MARTHA GOOCH SHE WAS A CAPITAL NURSE AND IN GREAT DEMAND TO CARE FOR NEWLY BORN BABIES THEREFORE
SO NOW LITTLE ONE RUN AWAY HOME AND TRY TO BE MORE THOUGHTFUL IN THE FUTURE YOUR SHEEP WILL NEVER MISS THE TAILS
AND A WRITER IN THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT OF JUNE SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR SAYS FLEET'S BOOK WAS PARTLY A REPRINT OF AN ENGLISH COLLECTION OF SONGS BARCLAY'S AND THE NEW TITLE WAS DOUBTLESS A COMPLIMENT BY THE PRINTER TO HIS MOTHER IN LAW GOOSE FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS
BUT THE VERY FIRST SHEEP SHE CAME TO REFUSED TO ALLOW HER TO SEW ON THE TAIL AND RAN AWAY FROM HER AND THE OTHERS DID THE SAME SO THAT FINALLY SHE WAS UTTERLY DISCOURAGED SHE WAS BEGINNING TO CRY AGAIN WHEN THE SAME OLD WOMAN SHE HAD BEFORE MET
AND EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE APPEALS MORE TO THE CHILDISH MIND THAN DOES MOTHER GOOSE HERSELF MANY OF THESE NURSERY RHYMES ARE COMPLETE TALES IN THEMSELVES TELLING THEIR STORY TERSELY BUT COMPLETELY THERE ARE OTHERS WHICH ARE BUT BARE SUGGESTIONS
BOSTON CHILDREN AT THAT DATE SAYS MISTER WHITMORE WERE FED UPON GOSPEL FOOD AND IT SEEMS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT AN EDITION COULD HAVE BEEN SOLD
BUT WHERE IS YOUR CROOK ON THE GRASS BESIDE ME AND WHERE ARE YOUR SHEEP BO PEEP LOOKED UP AND COULD NOT SEE THEM THEY MUST HAVE STRAYED OVER THE TOP OF THE HILL SHE SAID AND I WILL GO AND SEEK THEM
WRITTEN ALSO VERGOOSE AND VERTIGOOSE WHO BELONGED TO A WEALTHY FAMILY HER ELDEST DAUGHTER ELIZABETH GOOSE OR VERTIGOOSE
AND THERE WERE MANY WILLING HANDS TO AID HER IF WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN SHE NEEDED THEIR ASSISTANCE BO PEEP USUALLY TOOK HER SHEEP TO THE SIDE OF A HIGH HILL ABOVE THE COTTAGE AND ALLOWED THEM TO EAT THE RICH GRASS WHILE SHE HERSELF SAT UPON A MOUND AND
AT ONE TIME MISTRESS GOOCH WAS NURSING A CHILD OF MISTER RONALD BARCLAY A PHYSICIAN RESIDING IN THE TOWN AND HE NOTICED THE RHYMES SHE SANG AND BECAME INTERESTED IN THEM IN TIME HE WROTE THEM ALL DOWN AND MADE A BOOK OF THEM
NO ONE IN THIS WORLD KNOWS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING SHEEP DO NOT HAVE LONG TAILS THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE STUMP TO ANSWER FOR A TAIL NEITHER DO RABBITS HAVE TAILS NOR BEARS NOR MANY OTHER ANIMALS
DO NOT BE IN A HURRY CROAKED THE OLD WOMAN THEY WILL RETURN PRESENTLY WITHOUT YOUR TROUBLING TO FIND THEM DO YOU THINK SO ASKED BO PEEP OF COURSE DO NOT THE SHEEP KNOW YOU
CAME HOBBLING TO HER SIDE AND ASKED WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY CAT TAILS YOUR CAT TAILS REPLIED BO PEEP IN SURPRISE WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY THESE TAILS ARE ALL CUT FROM WHITE PUSSYCATS AND I PUT THEM ON THE TREE TO DRY
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THEM I THOUGHT THEY BELONGED TO MY SHEEP ANSWERED BO PEEP SORROWFULLY
SAID THE OLD WOMAN I AM GOING OVER THE HILL TOP MYSELF AND I WILL SEND THE SHEEP BACK TO YOU SO SHE GOT UPON HER FEET AND BEGAN CLIMBING THE HILL AND THE GIRL HEARD HER SAYING AS SHE WALKED AWAY LITTLE BO PEEP HAS LOST HER SHEEP
THROUGH LONG YEARS OF SERVICE AS NURSE SHE CAME TO BE CALLED MOTHER GOOCH THIS GOOD WOMAN HAD ONE PECULIARITY SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO CROON QUEER RHYMES AND JINGLES OVER THE CRADLES OF HER CHARGES AND THESE RHYMES
LITTLE BO PEEP FELL FAST ASLEEP AND DREAMT SHE HEARD THEM BLEATING BUT WHEN SHE AWOKE SHE FOUND IT A JOKE FOR STILL THEY WERE A FLEETING THE GIRL NOW BECAME QUITE ANXIOUS AND WONDERED WHY THE OLD WOMAN HAD NOT DRIVEN HER FLOCK OVER THE HILL
GAZED BELOW HER QUIETLY FEEDING UPON THE RICH GRASS WAS HER TRUANT FLOCK LOOKING AS PEACEFUL AND INNOCENT AS IF IT HAD NEVER STRAYED AWAY FROM ITS GENTLE SHEPHERDESS BO PEEP UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AND HURRIED TOWARD THEM
AND THOSE WHO MET HER WONDERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MAKE THE SWEET LITTLE MAID SO ANXIOUS BUT THERE IS AN END TO ALL TROUBLES NO MATTER HOW SEVERE THEY MAY SEEM TO BE AND IT HAPPENED ONE DAY AS BO PEEP DID STRAY UNTO A MEADOW HARD BY
NONE OF US WHETHER CHILDREN OR ADULTS NEEDS AN INTRODUCTION TO MOTHER GOOSE THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE EARLIEST IMPRESSED UPON OUR MINDS CLING TO THEM MOST TENACIOUSLY THE SNATCHES SUNG IN THE NURSERY ARE NEVER FORGOTTEN
LEAVING THE IMAGINATION TO WEAVE IN THE DETAILS OF THE STORY PERHAPS THEREIN MAY LIE PART OF THEIR CHARM BUT HOWEVER THAT MAY BE I HAVE THOUGHT THE CHILDREN MIGHT LIKE THE STORIES TOLD AT GREATER LENGTH THAT THEY MAY DWELL THE LONGER UPON THEIR FAVORITE HEROES AND HEROINES
AND SEE THE KINDLY WRINKLED FACE OF THE GRANDMOTHER AS SHE CROONS THE OLD DITTIES TO QUIET OUR RESTLESS SPIRITS ONE GENERATION IS LINKED TO ANOTHER BY THE EVERLASTING SPIRIT OF SONG
AND DOES N'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND EM BUT LEAVE EM ALONE AND THEY LL COME HOME ALL WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND EM LITTLE BO PEEP SAT STILL AND WATCHED THE OLD WOMAN TOIL SLOWLY UP THE HILL SIDE AND DISAPPEAR OVER THE TOP BY AND BY SHE THOUGHT
HE'S SEEN HIS SLICE OF LUCK HAS DICK AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT BUT HERE THE LONG MAN WITH THE YELLOW EYES STRUCK IN
KILL THAT BOY NOT ME MATES AND NUMBER THREE AH WELL THERE'S A DEAL TO SAY TO NUMBER THREE MAYBE YOU DON'T COUNT IT NOTHING TO HAVE A REAL COLLEGE DOCTOR TO SEE YOU EVERY DAY YOU JOHN WITH YOUR HEAD BROKE
AH IT'S A FINE DANCE I'M WITH YOU THERE AND LOOKS MIGHTY LIKE A HORNPIPE IN A ROPE'S END AT EXECUTION DOCK BY LONDON TOWN IT DOES BUT WHO DONE IT WHY IT WAS ANDERSON AND HANDS AND YOU GEORGE MERRY
THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGE SPUN ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM AND FELL ALL HIS LENGTH UPON HIS SIDE WHERE HE LAY DEAD BUT STILL TWITCHING AND THE OTHER THREE TURNED AND RAN FOR IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
DARTING FURIOUS GLANCES BEHIND THEM ONE THING I OBSERVED WHICH LOOKED WELL FOR US THEY ALL GOT OUT UPON THE OPPOSITE SIDE FROM SILVER WELL THERE WE STOOD TWO ON ONE SIDE FIVE ON THE OTHER THE PIT BETWEEN US
NOW THAT'S ABOUT WHERE WE ARE EVERY MOTHER'S SON OF US THANKS TO HIM AND HANDS AND ANDERSON AND OTHER RUINATION FOOLS OF YOU
EVERY THOUGHT OF HIS SOUL HAD BEEN SET FULL STRETCH LIKE A RACER ON THAT MONEY WELL HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A SINGLE SECOND DEAD AND HE KEPT HIS HEAD FOUND HIS TEMPER AND CHANGED HIS PLAN BEFORE THE OTHERS HAD HAD TIME TO REALIZE THE DISAPPOINTMENT
I BEHELD GREAT HEAPS OF COIN AND QUADRILATERALS BUILT OF BARS OF GOLD THAT WAS FLINT'S TREASURE THAT WE HAD COME SO FAR TO SEEK AND THAT HAD COST ALREADY THE LIVES OF SEVENTEEN MEN FROM THE HISPANIOLA
CAPTAIN SMOLLETT IS NOW RETIRED FROM THE SEA GRAY NOT ONLY SAVED HIS MONEY BUT BEING SUDDENLY SMIT WITH THE DESIRE TO RISE ALSO STUDIED HIS PROFESSION AND HE IS NOW MATE AND PART OWNER OF A FINE FULL RIGGED SHIP
I'M BEN GUNN I AM REPLIED THE MAROON WRIGGLING LIKE AN EEL IN HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND HE ADDED AFTER A LONG PAUSE HOW DO MISTER SILVER PRETTY WELL I THANK YE SAYS YOU
BUT THIS TOPS THE STIFFEST YARN TO NOTHING SILVER PAUSED AND I COULD SEE BY THE FACES OF GEORGE AND HIS LATE COMRADES THAT THESE WORDS HAD NOT BEEN SAID IN VAIN THAT'S FOR NUMBER ONE
TO ME HE WAS CORDIAL AND KIND SAYING NOTHING OF MY ESCAPADE EITHER IN THE WAY OF BLAME OR PRAISE AT SILVER'S POLITE SALUTE HE SOMEWHAT FLUSHED JOHN SILVER
THAT MAN WITH THE ONE LEG HAD STAYED ABOARD BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL THE SEA COOK HAD NOT GONE EMPTY HANDED HE HAD CUT THROUGH A BULKHEAD UNOBSERVED AND HAD REMOVED ONE OF THE SACKS OF COIN
CRIED THE ACCUSED WIPING THE SWEAT FROM HIS BROW FOR HE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH A VEHEMENCE THAT SHOOK THE HOUSE
INDEED IT WAS REMARKABLE HOW WELL HE BORE THESE SLIGHTS AND WITH WHAT UNWEARYING POLITENESS HE KEPT ON TRYING TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH ALL YET I THINK NONE TREATED HIM BETTER THAN A DOG UNLESS IT WAS BEN GUNN
THE EMBERS OF THE GREAT FIRE HAD SO FAR BURNED THEMSELVES OUT AND NOW GLOWED SO LOW AND DUSKILY THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHY THESE CONSPIRATORS DESIRED A TORCH ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE SLOPE TO THE STOCKADE THEY WERE COLLECTED IN A GROUP
AH MERRY REMARKED SILVER STANDING FOR CAP'N AGAIN YOU'RE A PUSHING LAD TO BE SURE BUT THIS TIME EVERYONE WAS ENTIRELY IN MERRY'S FAVOUR THEY BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE EXCAVATION
BUT WERE AT SEA WITH IT BESIDES IN SAFETY YES SAID ONE THAT'S FLINT SURE ENOUGH J F AND A SCORE BELOW WITH A CLOVE HITCH TO IT SO HE DONE EVER
WORTH PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED GUINEAS TO HELP HIM ON HIS FURTHER WANDERINGS I THINK WE WERE ALL PLEASED TO BE SO CHEAPLY QUIT OF HIM
GIVEN HIM THE STORES FOR BEN GUNN'S CAVE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH GOATS MEAT SALTED BY HIMSELF GIVEN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO GET A CHANCE OF MOVING IN SAFETY FROM THE STOCKADE TO THE TWO POINTED HILL THERE TO BE CLEAR OF MALARIA
YOU'LL ALL SWING NOW I RECKON WHAT SOFT HEADED LUBBER HAD A BIBLE IT WAS DICK SAID ONE DICK WAS IT THEN DICK CAN GET TO PRAYERS SAID SILVER
SOMETIMES PLUNGING THROUGH THE BUSHES TO THE CHEST I TELL YOU BUT SILVER WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP UP WITH US THE WORK THAT MAN WENT THROUGH
NO HURRY SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS NO HURRY IN A MORE OPEN PART OF THE PLATEAU WE COULD SEE THE THREE SURVIVORS STILL RUNNING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THEY HAD STARTED
AND THE ARMS STILL LIE FOR ALL THAT I KNOW WHERE FLINT BURIED THEM AND CERTAINLY THEY SHALL LIE THERE FOR ME
AND KEEP A GUARD UPON THE MONEY AS FOR YOU JIM HE SAID IT WENT AGAINST MY HEART
AND AS IT WAS WHAT WITH BAFFLING WINDS AND A COUPLE OF FRESH GALES WE WERE ALL WORN OUT BEFORE WE REACHED IT IT WAS JUST AT SUNDOWN WHEN WE CAST ANCHOR IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL LAND LOCKED GULF
BUT IF I WERE SURE THEY WERE RAVING AS I AM MORALLY CERTAIN ONE AT LEAST OF THEM IS DOWN WITH FEVER I SHOULD LEAVE THIS CAMP AND AT WHATEVER RISK TO MY OWN CARCASS TAKE THEM THE ASSISTANCE OF MY SKILL
MIGHTY PRETTY SAID GEORGE BUT HOW ARE WE TO GET AWAY WITH IT AND US NO SHIP SILVER SUDDENLY SPRANG UP AND SUPPORTING HIMSELF WITH A HAND AGAINST THE WALL
REPLIED LONG JOHN AGAIN SALUTING I DARE YOU TO THANK ME CRIED THE SQUIRE IT IS A GROSS DERELICTION OF MY DUTY STAND BACK AND THEREUPON WE ALL ENTERED THE CAVE
A BIBLE WITH A BIT CUT OUT RETURNED SILVER DERISIVELY NOT IT
TWO OF THE BARS SLUNG IN A ROPE'S END MADE A GOOD LOAD FOR A GROWN MAN ONE THAT HE WAS GLAD TO WALK SLOWLY WITH FOR MY PART
HOW SOON AT THE APPEARANCE OF THESE GRAND COURT CARDS DID THOSE POOR LITTLE NEGLECTED DEUCES SINK DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK STEYNE BAREACRES JOHNES OF HELVELLYN AND CAERYLON OF CAMELOT
AND THAT MADAME BOBINOT IS WRITING DUNNING LETTERS EVERY WEEK FOR THE MONEY THUS RAWDON KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE BRILLIANT DIAMOND EAR RINGS OR THE SUPERB BRILLIANT ORNAMENT WHICH DECORATED THE FAIR BOSOM OF HIS LADY BUT LORD STEYNE WHO WAS IN HIS PLACE AT COURT
AND PRESENTLY SIR PITT ISSUED FORTH FROM THE HOUSE AGAIN LEADING FORTH A LADY WITH GRAND FEATHERS COVERED IN A WHITE SHAWL AND HOLDING UP DAINTILY A TRAIN OF MAGNIFICENT BROCADE SHE STEPPED INTO THE VEHICLE
ABOUT THE AIRS WHICH THAT WOMAN WAS GIVING HERSELF MISSUS BUTE CRAWLEY AND HER YOUNG LADIES IN THE COUNTRY HAD A COPY OF THE MORNING POST FROM TOWN
I COULDN'T COME BEFORE I WAS IN THE KITCHEN MAKING A PUDDING I KNOW YOU WERE I SAW YOU THROUGH THE AREA RAILINGS AS I DROVE UP REPLIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
WHICH HAD GROWN WOEFULLY SHABBY AND WAS MUCH TOO TIGHT HE WAS TO HAVE FOLLOWED THE PROCESSION AND WAITED UPON HIS SOVEREIGN IN A CAB BUT THAT HIS GOOD NATURED SISTER IN LAW INSISTED THAT THEY SHOULD BE A FAMILY PARTY THE COACH WAS LARGE
THERE CAME TWO NOTES FROM GAUNT HOUSE FOR THE LITTLE WOMAN THE ONE CONTAINING A CARD OF INVITATION FROM LORD AND LADY STEYNE TO A DINNER AT GAUNT HOUSE NEXT FRIDAY WHILE THE OTHER ENCLOSED A SLIP OF GRAY PAPER BEARING LORD STEYNE'S SIGNATURE AND THE ADDRESS OF MESSRS JONES
I DAREN'T SLEEP IN WHAT THEY CALL MY BEDROOM THE BED IS LIKE THE BALDAQUIN OF SAINT PETER'S AND THE PICTURES FRIGHTEN ME I HAVE A LITTLE BRASS BED IN A DRESSING ROOM AND A LITTLE HAIR MATTRESS LIKE AN ANCHORITE I AM AN ANCHORITE
TO DOUBT ANY MORE ABOUT HER VIRTUE I FOR MY PART LOOK BACK WITH LOVE AND AWE TO THAT GREAT CHARACTER IN HISTORY AH WHAT A HIGH AND NOBLE APPRECIATION OF GENTLEWOMANHOOD
SAID THE PEER WITH AN OATH AND BECKY REFLECTING ON THE LARGENESS OF HIS MEANS MENTIONED NOT ONLY THE SUM WHICH SHE HAD BORROWED FROM MISS BRIGGS BUT ONE OF NEARLY DOUBLE THE AMOUNT THIS CAUSED THE LORD STEYNE TO BREAK OUT IN ANOTHER BRIEF AND ENERGETIC EXPRESSION OF ANGER
YES WE SAW HIM FATE CANNOT DEPRIVE US OF THAT OTHERS HAVE SEEN NAPOLEON SOME FEW STILL EXIST WHO HAVE BEHELD FREDERICK THE GREAT DOCTOR JOHNSON
IF YOU HAD BEEN SANDY HAIRED GREEN EYED AND A FRENCH ROPE DANCER'S DAUGHTER MISSUS BUTE SAID TO HER ELDEST GIRL WHO ON THE CONTRARY WAS A VERY SWARTHY SHORT AND SNUB NOSED YOUNG LADY
YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD SUPERB DIAMONDS FORSOOTH AND HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AT COURT BY YOUR COUSIN THE LADY JANE
BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT IT WAS THE FIRST GENTLEMAN IN EUROPE IN WHOSE HIGH PRESENCE MISSUS RAWDON PASSED HER EXAMINATION AND AS IT WERE TOOK HER DEGREE IN REPUTATION IT SURELY MUST BE FLAT DISLOYALTY
RELENTED AND ONLY DELIVERED IN A COUPLE OF CARDS ON WHICH WERE ENGRAVEN THE NAMES OF THE MARCHIONESS OF STEYNE AND THE COUNTESS OF GAUNT IF THESE BITS OF PASTEBOARD
AS THE LACED JACKETED BAND OF THE LIFE GUARDS ARE BLOWING TRIUMPHAL MARCHES SEATED ON THOSE PRANCING MUSIC STOOLS THEIR CREAM COLOURED CHARGERS WHO ARE BY NO MEANS LOVELY AND ENTICING OBJECTS
YOU POOR LITTLE EARTHENWARE PIPKIN YOU WANT TO SWIM DOWN THE STREAM ALONG WITH THE GREAT COPPER KETTLES
AH WHAT SHALL I DO LORD STEYNE FOR I AM VERY VERY UNHAPPY LORD STEYNE MADE NO REPLY EXCEPT BY BEATING THE DEVIL'S TATTOO AND BITING HIS NAILS AT LAST HE CLAPPED HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD AND FLUNG OUT OF THE ROOM
TO KNOW NOTHING OR LITTLE IS IN THE NATURE OF SOME HUSBANDS TO HIDE IN THE NATURE OF HOW MANY WOMEN OH LADIES HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE SURREPTITIOUS MILLINERS BILLS HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE GOWNS AND BRACELETS WHICH YOU DAREN'T SHOW OR WHICH YOU WEAR TREMBLING
WORSE THAN THAT SAID BECKY STILL CASTING DOWN HER EYES I HAVE RUINED HER RUINED HER
HER COMPLEXION COULD BEAR ANY SUNSHINE AS YET AND HER DRESS THOUGH IF YOU WERE TO SEE IT NOW ANY PRESENT LADY OF VANITY FAIR WOULD PRONOUNCE IT TO BE THE MOST FOOLISH AND PREPOSTEROUS ATTIRE EVER WORN WAS AS HANDSOME IN HER EYES AND THOSE OF THE PUBLIC
WHY YOU SILLY MAN SHE CONTINUED WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE I GOT THEM ALL EXCEPT THE LITTLE CLASP WHICH A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE GAVE ME LONG AGO I HIRED THEM TO BE SURE I HIRED THEM AT MISTER POLONIUS'S IN COVENTRY STREET
AND SAINT JAMES'S STREET TOWARDS THE OLD BRICK PALACE WHERE THE STAR OF BRUNSWICK WAS IN WAITING TO RECEIVE HIS NOBLES AND GENTLEFOLKS BECKY FELT AS IF SHE COULD BLESS THE PEOPLE OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOWS
AND OTHER GREAT OFFICERS OF STATE WERE BEHIND THE CHAIR ON WHICH HE SAT HE SAT FLORID OF FACE PORTLY OF PERSON COVERED WITH ORDERS AND IN A RICH CURLING HEAD OF HAIR HOW WE SANG GOD SAVE HIM
THE BROCADE WAS AN OLD REMNANT BECKY SAID AND AS FOR THE LACE IT WAS A GREAT BARGAIN SHE HAD HAD IT THESE HUNDRED YEARS MY DEAR MISSUS CRAWLEY
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN IN VANITY FAIR WHEN THAT REVERED AND AUGUST BEING WAS INVESTED BY THE UNIVERSAL ACCLAIM OF THE REFINED AND EDUCATED PORTION OF THIS EMPIRE WITH THE TITLE OF PREMIER GENTILHOMME
AS ONE UNCHARITABLE TO HER KINSWOMAN AND YET IF LADY JANE HAD KNOWN ALL I THINK EVEN HER KINDLY TEMPER WOULD HAVE FAILED HER THE FACT IS WHEN SHE WAS PUTTING SIR PITT'S HOUSE IN ORDER
WHERE THE DOOSE DID YOU GET THE DIAMONDS BECKY SAID HER HUSBAND ADMIRING SOME JEWELS
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD YOUR OWN THERE YOU SILLY LITTLE FOOL YOU'VE GOT NO MONEY YOU WILL GET US A PLACE INTERPOSED BECKY AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE YOU'VE GOT NO MONEY AND YOU WANT TO COMPETE WITH THOSE WHO HAVE
OF THE TWO VESSELS FROM WHICH THEY FLOW AND THUS PREVENT ANY MORE BLOOD FROM COMING DOWN INTO THE HEART AND BECOMING MORE AND MORE RAREFIED THEY PUSH OPEN THE SIX SMALL VALVES THAT ARE IN THE ORIFICES OF THE OTHER TWO VESSELS THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS OUT
I SHOULD WISH ALSO THAT SUCH PERSONS WERE CAREFULLY SHOWN THE ELEVEN PELLICLES WHICH LIKE SO MANY SMALL VALVES OPEN AND SHUT THE FOUR ORIFICES THAT ARE IN THESE TWO CAVITIES VIZ
ARE IMMEDIATELY RAREFIED AND DILATED BY THE HEAT THEY MEET WITH IN THIS WAY THEY CAUSE THE WHOLE HEART TO EXPAND AND AT THE SAME TIME PRESS HOME AND SHUT THE FIVE SMALL VALVES THAT ARE AT THE ENTRANCES
AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT AFTER THIS LIFE WE HAVE NOTHING TO HOPE FOR OR FEAR MORE THAN FLIES AND ANTS IN PLACE OF WHICH WHEN WE KNOW HOW FAR THEY DIFFER WE MUCH BETTER COMPREHEND THE REASONS WHICH ESTABLISH
PRESENTLY DISPERSE THEMSELVES ALL OVER THE LUNGS IN THE SECOND PLACE THE CAVITY IN THE LEFT SIDE
IS THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE MOTION OF THE BLOOD THUS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE BLOOD WHICH FLOWS FROM THE VEINS AND THAT FROM THE ARTERIES CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THIS
AND THERE FORM AS IT WERE TWO POUCHES DENOMINATED THE AURICLES OF THE HEART WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF A SUBSTANCE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE HEART ITSELF AND THAT THERE IS ALWAYS MORE WARMTH IN THE HEART THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE BODY
AND WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAT IN HAY THAT HAS BEEN HEAPED TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS DRY OR THAT WHICH CAUSES FERMENTATION IN NEW WINES BEFORE THEY ARE RUN CLEAR OF THE FRUIT FOR WHEN I EXAMINED THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS WHICH MIGHT
WHICH ARRANGED IN A MANNER EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE FORMER READILY PERMIT THE BLOOD CONTAINED IN THIS CAVITY TO PASS INTO THE LUNGS BUT HINDER THAT CONTAINED IN THE LUNGS FROM RETURNING TO THIS CAVITY AND IN LIKE MANNER
FROM COMING FORWARD THROUGH THE ARTERIES BECAUSE THESE ARE SITUATED BELOW THE VEINS AND THEIR COVERINGS FROM THEIR GREATER CONSISTENCY ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO COMPRESS AND ALSO THAT THE BLOOD WHICH COMES FROM THE HEART TENDS TO PASS THROUGH THEM
IN THE MOST DIRECT LINES AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MECHANICS WHICH ARE THE SAME WITH THOSE OF NATURE WHEN MANY OBJECTS TEND AT ONCE TO THE SAME POINT
AND THIS PROVES NOT ONLY THAT THE BRUTES HAVE LESS REASON THAN MAN BUT THAT THEY HAVE NONE AT ALL FOR WE SEE THAT VERY LITTLE IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE A PERSON TO SPEAK
AND AFTER THAT DID NOTHING MORE THAN LEND HIS ORDINARY CONCURRENCE TO NATURE AND ALLOW HER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED ON THIS SUPPOSITION I IN THE FIRST PLACE DESCRIBED THIS MATTER
FOR AS THIS TRANSMUTATION OF ASHES INTO GLASS APPEARED TO ME AS WONDERFUL AS ANY OTHER IN NATURE I TOOK A SPECIAL PLEASURE IN DESCRIBING IT I WAS NOT HOWEVER DISPOSED FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
AS TO PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF HEAVENS HOW IN THE MEANTIME SOME OF ITS PARTS MUST COMPOSE AN EARTH AND SOME PLANETS AND COMETS AND OTHERS A SUN AND FIXED STARS AND MAKING A DIGRESSION AT THIS STAGE ON THE SUBJECT OF LIGHT
THE SITUATION AND SHAPE OF ITS COUNTERWEIGHTS AND WHEELS BUT IF IT BE ASKED HOW IT HAPPENS THAT THE BLOOD IN THE VEINS FLOWING IN THIS WAY CONTINUALLY INTO THE HEART IS NOT EXHAUSTED
FROM THE VERY ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WHICH MAY BE OBSERVED IN THE HEART BY THE EYE ALONE AND FROM THE HEAT WHICH MAY BE FELT WITH THE FINGERS AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE BLOOD AS LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE AS DOES THE MOTION OF A CLOCK FROM THE POWER
TO THOSE WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE VARIETY OF MOVEMENTS PERFORMED BY THE DIFFERENT AUTOMATA OR MOVING MACHINES FABRICATED BY HUMAN INDUSTRY AND THAT WITH HELP OF BUT FEW PIECES COMPARED WITH THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF BONES
TO GIVE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS CONTAINED IN IT THE POWER TO MOVE THE MEMBERS AS WHEN WE SEE HEADS SHORTLY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK OFF STILL MOVE AND BITE THE EARTH ALTHOUGH NO LONGER ANIMATED WHAT CHANGES MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE BRAIN TO PRODUCE
WHEREAS THE OTHERS BEING ROUND ARE MORE CONVENIENTLY CLOSED WITH THREE BESIDES I WISH SUCH PERSONS TO OBSERVE THAT THE GRAND ARTERY AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN ARE OF MUCH HARDER AND FIRMER TEXTURE
TO THAT OBSERVED IN OUR SEAS AS ALSO A CERTAIN CURRENT BOTH OF WATER AND AIR FROM EAST TO WEST SUCH AS IS LIKEWISE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TROPICS HOW THE MOUNTAINS SEAS FOUNTAINS AND RIVERS MIGHT NATURALLY BE FORMED IN IT
FURTHER TO ENABLE ME TO CAST THIS VARIETY OF SUBJECTS SOMEWHAT INTO THE SHADE AND TO EXPRESS MY JUDGMENT REGARDING THEM WITH GREATER FREEDOM WITHOUT BEING NECESSITATED TO ADOPT OR REFUTE THE OPINIONS OF THE LEARNED
WILL AFFORD THE MEANS OF READILY DETERMINING WHAT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF ALL THE REST
I HAD EXPOUNDED ALL THESE MATTERS WITH SUFFICIENT MINUTENESS IN THE TREATISE WHICH I FORMERLY THOUGHT OF PUBLISHING AND AFTER THESE I HAD SHOWN WHAT MUST BE THE FABRIC OF THE NERVES AND MUSCLES OF THE HUMAN BODY
WHICH BY BEING VARIOUSLY PERFORATED SERVE TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF GRAIN AND IN THE LAST PLACE WHAT ABOVE ALL IS HERE WORTHY OF OBSERVATION
THAT THOUGH THERE ARE MANY ANIMALS WHICH MANIFEST MORE INDUSTRY THAN WE IN CERTAIN OF THEIR ACTIONS THE SAME ANIMALS ARE YET OBSERVED TO SHOW NONE AT ALL IN MANY OTHERS SO THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY DO BETTER
IN PARTS MORE REMOTE FROM IT IN THE NEXT PLACE
VENOUS ARTERY OPEN ANEW AND ALLOW A PASSAGE
SINCE THEY ARE ENDOWED WITH MANY ORGANS ANALOGOUS TO OURS THEY COULD AS EASILY COMMUNICATE THEIR THOUGHTS TO US AS TO THEIR FELLOWS
APPOSITELY TO REPLY TO WHAT IS SAID IN ITS PRESENCE AS MEN OF THE LOWEST GRADE OF INTELLECT CAN DO THE SECOND TEST IS THAT ALTHOUGH SUCH MACHINES MIGHT EXECUTE MANY THINGS WITH EQUAL OR PERHAPS GREATER PERFECTION THAN ANY OF US
MISTER GARDINER SOON WROTE AGAIN TO HIS BROTHER TO MISTER BENNET'S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS HE BRIEFLY REPLIED WITH ASSURANCE OF HIS EAGERNESS TO PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF ANY OF HIS FAMILY
THAN TO ANY SENSE OF SHAME AT HER ELOPING AND LIVING WITH WICKHAM A FORTNIGHT BEFORE THEY TOOK PLACE
MISTER WICKHAM HAD RECEIVED HIS COMMISSION BEFORE HE LEFT LONDON AND HE WAS TO JOIN HIS REGIMENT AT THE END OF A FORTNIGHT NO ONE BUT MISSUS BENNET REGRETTED THAT THEIR STAY WOULD BE SO SHORT AND SHE MADE THE MOST OF THE TIME BY VISITING ABOUT WITH HER DAUGHTER AND HAVING VERY FREQUENT PARTIES AT HOME
MOST OF THE GOALS TOWARDS WHICH THE AVERAGE MAN STRIVES STRUCK HIM AS TOO UNAMBITIOUS FOR THE PRODIGY
WICKHAM WAS NOT AT ALL MORE DISTRESSED THAN HERSELF BUT HIS MANNERS WERE ALWAYS SO PLEASING THAT HAD HIS CHARACTER AND HIS MARRIAGE BEEN EXACTLY WHAT THEY OUGHT HIS SMILES AND HIS EASY ADDRESS
COMRADE B HAD TO LAY IT ON REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE IN AMERICA AS POSSIBLY YOU ARE AWARE THERE IS A REGULAR POST OF MISTAKE CLERK WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO RECEIVE IN THE NECK ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO BE COMING ALONG WHEN CUSTOMERS MAKE COMPLAINTS HE IS HAULED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE FOAMING CUSTOMER
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG MEN TOO THAT SHE LIKES VERY MUCH THE OFFICERS MAY NOT BE SO PLEASANT IN GENERAL REGIMENT HIS DAUGHTER'S REQUEST FOR SUCH IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED OF BEING ADMITTED INTO HER FAMILY AGAIN BEFORE SHE SET OFF FOR THE NORTH
HE GREETED CUSTOMERS WITH BRIGHT REMARKS ON THE WEATHER AND SNAPPY VIEWS ON THE LEADING EVENTS OF THE DAY THE FORMER TINGED WITH OPTIMISM THE LATTER FULL OF A GENTLE SPIRIT OF TOLERATION
THE THING MUST STOP YOUR SECRETARIAL DUTIES MUST BE PARAMOUNT NOTHING MUST BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH THEM YES THE THING MUST STOP BEFORE IT GOES TOO FAR IT SEEMS TO ME SAID MIKE THAT IT HAS GONE TOO FAR I'VE GOT THE SACK
BLOOMING HURRICANE MORE LIKE IT I WAS IN BICK'S ROOM JUST NOW WITH A LETTER TO SIGN AND I TELL YOU THE FUR WAS FLYING ALL OVER THE BALLY SHOP
FOR WHICH I HAVE PLEDGED MYSELF AND WILL YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE OF CARRYING SIMILAR ASSURANCES TO HIS CREDITORS IN MERYTON OF WHOM I SHALL SUBJOIN A LIST ACCORDING TO HIS INFORMATION HE HAS GIVEN IN ALL HIS DEBTS I HOPE AT LEAST HE HAS NOT DECEIVED US
THOUGH I WAS THERE A FORTNIGHT NOT ONE PARTY OR SCHEME OR ANYTHING
MY UNCLE AND AUNT AND I WERE TO GO TOGETHER AND THE OTHERS WERE TO MEET US AT THE CHURCH WELL MONDAY MORNING CAME AND I WAS IN SUCH A FUSS I WAS SO AFRAID YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO PUT IT OFF
AND MY DEAR AUNT IF YOU DO NOT TELL ME IN AN HONOURABLE MANNER I SHALL CERTAINLY BE REDUCED TO TRICKS AND STRATAGEMS TO FIND IT OUT JANE'S DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO SPEAK TO ELIZABETH PRIVATELY OF WHAT LYDIA HAD LET FALL ELIZABETH WAS GLAD OF IT
I HAVE WRITTEN TO COLONEL FORSTER TO INFORM HIM OF OUR PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS AND TO REQUEST THAT HE WILL SATISFY THE VARIOUS CREDITORS OF MISTER WICKHAM IN AND NEAR BRIGHTON
LOOK HERE SMITH HE SAID I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU I'M IN A BIT OF A HOLE
GAVE HER HAND WITH AN AFFECTIONATE SMILE TO WICKHAM WHO FOLLOWED HIS LADY AND WISHED THEM BOTH JOY WITH AN ALACRITY WHICH SHEWED NO DOUBT OF THEIR HAPPINESS THEIR RECEPTION FROM MISTER BENNET TO WHOM THEY THEN TURNED WAS NOT QUITE SO CORDIAL HIS COUNTENANCE RATHER GAINED IN AUSTERITY
COULD BE SPUN OUT FROM HALF PAST TWELVE TO TWO MORE WORK FROM TWO TILL HALF PAST THREE FROM HALF PAST THREE TILL HALF PAST FOUR TEA IN THE TEAROOM WITH A NOVEL
BOTH ON HIS ACCOUNT AND MY NIECE'S IT IS MISTER WICKHAM'S INTENTION TO GO INTO THE REGULARS AND AMONG HIS FORMER FRIENDS THERE ARE STILL SOME WHO ARE ABLE AND WILLING TO ASSIST HIM IN THE ARMY HE HAS THE PROMISE OF AN ENSIGNCY IN GENERAL REGIMENT
HOW DO THESE IDEAS GET ABOUT I YIELD TO NOBODY IN MY RESPECT FOR OUR MANAGER I MAY HAVE HAD OCCASION FROM TIME TO TIME TO CORRECT HIM IN SOME TRIFLING MATTER
THAT WAS AT TEN O'CLOCK FROM TEN TO ELEVEN HE WOULD POTTER THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON AT THAT TIME IN HIS DEPARTMENT
BUT HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THE FACT ROUND WHICH IT REVOLVED
SHE HAD NO FEAR OF ITS SPREADING FARTHER THROUGH HIS MEANS
WHICH I JOLLY WELL DID HE HAD STARTED JAWING JACKSON AGAIN BEFORE I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM WHILE APPLAUDING HIS HUSTLE SAID PSMITH I FEAR THAT I MUST TAKE OFFICIAL NOTICE OF THIS COMRADE JACKSON IS ESSENTIALLY A SENSITIVE PLANT HIGHLY STRUNG
HE RECOLLECTED THE MAN WHO HAD PRESENTED IT A TALLISH MAN WITH A BEARD
MISTER WALLER STILL CHIRPY HAD NOTHING BUT GOOD NEWS OF EDWARD MIKE WENT FOR HIS MORNING STROLL ROUND THE OFFICE FEELING THAT THINGS HAD SETTLED DOWN AND HAD MADE UP THEIR MIND TO RUN SMOOTHLY WHEN HE GOT BACK BARELY HALF AN HOUR LATER THE STORM HAD BURST
IS REASSURING I MAY NOW THINK OF MY OWN TROUBLES COMRADE BRISTOW HAS BLOWN INTO THE OFFICE TODAY IN PATENT LEATHER BOOTS WITH WHITE KID UPPERS AS I BELIEVE THE TECHNICAL TERM IS ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT HE IS STILL WEARING THE SATIN TIE THE WAISTCOAT AND THE RING
AND THERE WAS MY AUNT
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT THEY WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS AT HOME UP TILL NOW THE MATTER HAD SEEMED ENTIRELY A PERSONAL ONE
YOU MUST DROP IT COMRADE JACKSON WHEN YOU WERE FREE AND WITHOUT TIES IT DID NOT SO MUCH MATTER
MIKE FOUND HIMSELF BY DEGREES GROWING QUITE ATTACHED TO THE NEW ASIATIC BANK ONE MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY
WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TURMOIL I COULDN'T WAIT TO HEAR I WAS TOO JOLLY GLAD TO GET AWAY OLD BICK LOOKED AT ME AS IF HE COULD EAT ME
OR RATHER BEING APPARENTLY CERTAIN TO END SATISFACTORILY FOR THE INVALID THOUGH OUT OF DANGER WAS STILL IN BED
SHE REPENTED THOUGH SHE HARDLY KNEW OF WHAT SHE BECAME JEALOUS OF HIS ESTEEM WHEN SHE COULD NO LONGER HOPE TO BE BENEFITED BY IT SHE WANTED TO HEAR OF HIM WHEN THERE SEEMED THE LEAST CHANCE OF GAINING INTELLIGENCE
AND HER HUSBAND'S LOVE OF INDEPENDENCE HAD ALONE PREVENTED THEIR EXCEEDING THEIR INCOME FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS WAS SETTLED BY MARRIAGE ARTICLES ON MISSUS BENNET AND THE CHILDREN BUT IN WHAT PROPORTIONS IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED AMONGST THE LATTER DEPENDED ON THE WILL OF THE PARENTS
IT EMBRACES A HUNDRED DEGREES OF MEANING MIKE HAD EXPECTED SENTENCE OF DISMISSAL AND HE HAD GOT IT SO FAR HE HAD NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF
AGAIN WHAT COULD HE DO BY WAY OF EARNING A LIVING HE DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE CITY AND ITS WAYS BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUMMARY DISMISSAL FROM A BANK IS NOT THE BEST RECOMMENDATION ONE CAN PUT FORWARD IN APPLYING FOR ANOTHER JOB
AND THE TRAMP OF ARMED MEN UP QUICK CRIED ROBERT LET'S DROP THINGS ON THEM EVEN THE GIRLS WERE FEELING ALMOST BRAVE NOW THEY FOLLOWED ROBERT QUICKLY AND UNDER HIS DIRECTIONS
WHY SHOULD IT ASKED ROBERT WATER'S WATER ALL THE WORLD OVER
HE PEEPED INTO THE UPPER ROOM THE MAN WAS THERE AND IT WAS JAKIN ALL DRIPPING WITH MOAT WATER AND HE WAS FIDDLING ABOUT WITH THE MACHINERY WHICH ROBERT FELT SURE WORKED THE DRAWBRIDGE ROBERT BANGED THE DOOR SUDDENLY
THE SAME AS OURS IN THE STABLE YARD SAID JANE
THEN IF WE HAD THE MUTTON IT WOULD BE REAL SAID ROBERT OH DON'T I WISH WE COULD FIND IT BUT WE CAN'T FIND IT I SUPPOSE IT ISN'T OURS TILL WE'VE GOT IT IN OUR MOUTHS
WITH A SINGLE GROWN UP THE DOOR WAS OPENED SUDDENLY AND FIERCELY YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES SAID THE VOICE OF MARTHA
I THOUGHT WE COULDN'T GET THROUGH A WISH DAY WITHOUT A ROW SAID CYRIL IT WAS MUCH TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE COME ON BOBS MY MILITARY HERO IF WE LICK INTO BED SHARP SHE WON'T BE SO FRUMIOUS AND PERHAPS SHE'LL BONG US UP SOME SUPPER
THE MAN ANSWERED BACK
THEY KNEW BUT TOO WELL THAT FOR THEM THERE WAS NOTHING THERE BUT TABLE SUDDENLY CYRIL FELT IN HIS POCKET
SHE ADDED HASTILY AND JANE AS WELL AND WE HAVEN'T GOT INTO
AND TURNED THE GREAT KEY IN THE LOCK JUST AS JAKIN SPRANG TO THE INSIDE OF THE DOOR
AND COULD SEE TOO THAT BEYOND THE MOAT ON EVERY SIDE THE TENTS OF THE BESIEGING PARTY WERE PITCHED
BUT JANE HOPED THAT THE BESIEGERS WOULD NOT COME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR DAGGERS TO BE OF ANY USE NEVER MIND WE CAN HURL THEM LIKE JAVELINS SAID CYRIL OR DROP THEM ON PEOPLE'S HEADS
HULLO THERE ROBERT BELLOWED BACK AT ONCE IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD THE KING AND OF OUR GOOD LORD AND TRUSTY LEADER SIR WULFRIC DE TALBOT WE SUMMON THIS CASTLE TO SURRENDER ON PAIN OF FIRE AND SWORD AND NO QUARTER
IT ISN'T ROBERT WAS BEGINNING STERNLY BUT ANTHEA INTERRUPTED OH YES YOU DO SHE SAID COAXINGLY IT'S A VERY NICE GAME REALLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY GET IN AND IF THEY DO
THIS IS THE VERY FIRST THING WE'VE WISHED FOR THAT HASN'T GOT US INTO A ROW AND THERE HASN'T BEEN THE LEAST LITTLE SCRAP OF A ROW ABOUT THIS NOBODY'S RAGING DOWNSTAIRS WE'RE SAFE AND SOUND
DEFENDING TO THE DEATH I MEAN ASKED ANTHEA WE OUGHT TO BE HEAVILY ARMED AND THEN SHOOT AT THEM WHEN THEY ADVANCE TO THE ATTACK
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY AT BESIEGED CASTLES
IT IS REAL SAID ROBERT AND THEY ARE GOING TO ATTACK ALL RUSHED TO THE NARROW WINDOWS YES SAID ROBERT
THINKING OF THE BISCUITS WHO PUTS MUTTON IN THEIR POCKETS GOOSE GIRL SAID CYRIL BUT I KNOW AT ANY RATE I'LL TRY IT HE LEANED OVER THE TABLE WITH HIS FACE ABOUT AN
THAT'S THAT BEAST JAKIN SAID ROBERT THERE'S STILL THE PORTCULLIS I'M ALMOST CERTAIN THAT'S WORKED FROM LOWER DOWN AND NOW THE DRAWBRIDGE RANG AND ECHOED HOLLOWLY TO THE HOOFS OF HORSES
SO ANTHEA TILTED THE POT OVER THE NEAREST LEAD HOLE AND POURED THEY HEARD A SPLASH BELOW
TO THE OTHERS WHO HAD ONLY SEEN THE CAMP AND THE BESIEGERS FROM A DISTANCE THE WHOLE THING SEEMED HALF A GAME OF MAKE BELIEVE AND HALF A SPLENDIDLY DISTINCT AND PERFECTLY SAFE DREAM
I DON'T KNOW SAID CYRIL AFTER A PAUSE UNLESS IT'S BECAUSE WE HAD THEM
BECAUSE HE KNEW THIS WAS FOR A BATTERING RAM WHAT A GOOD THING WE'VE GOT A MOAT HE SAID AND WHAT A GOOD THING THE DRAWBRIDGE IS UP I SHOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN HOW TO WORK IT OF COURSE IT WOULD BE UP IN A BESIEGED CASTLE
IT IS TRUE THAT DIRECTLY HE BIT A PIECE OFF THE REST VANISHED
YES BUT LOOK HERE SQUIRREL SAID ROBERT YOU'RE SO CLEVER AT EXPLAINING ABOUT INVISIBLENESS AND ALL THAT HOW IS IT THE BISCUITS ARE HERE AND ALL THE BREAD AND MEAT AND THINGS HAVE DISAPPEARED
AND HIS FINGERS WERE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE ROBERT NEVER KNEW HOW THE MAN HAD MANAGED TO CLIMB UP OUT OF THE WATER BUT HE SAW THE CLINGING FINGERS AND HIT THEM AS HARD AS HE COULD WITH AN IRON BAR THAT HE CAUGHT UP FROM THE FLOOR THE MAN FELL
THEY WERE EATEN IN A HAPPY SILENCE THOUGH THEY TASTED A LITTLE ODDLY
I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T LAST THROUGH THE DAY WITHOUT GETTING UP TO SOME DOGGERY A PERSON CAN'T TAKE A BREATH OF AIR ON THE FRONT DOORSTEP BUT YOU MUST BE EMPTYING THE WASH HAND JUG ON TO THEIR HEADS OFF YOU GO TO BED THE LOT OF YOU
AND DE TALBOT FOR EVER ALL SUDDENLY STOPPED AND WENT OUT LIKE THE SNUFF OF A CANDLE THE LITTLE DARK ROOM SEEMED TO WHIRL ROUND AND TURN TOPSY TURVY AND WHEN THE CHILDREN CAME TO THEMSELVES
FOR NOBODY LOOKS NICE PICKING UP SLICES OF SUET PUDDING FROM THE TABLE IN ITS MOUTH LIKE A DOG THE GREAT THING AFTER ALL
A SIEGE AND BED THE CHILDREN WERE SITTING IN THE GLOOMY BANQUETING HALL AT THE END OF ONE OF THE LONG BARE WOODEN TABLES THERE WAS NOW NO HOPE
AND NOW EVERYONE FELT MORE COURAGE TO PREPARE FOR THE ATTACK THAT WAS TO BE DELIVERED BEFORE SUNSET ROBERT AS CAPTAIN INSISTED ON CLIMBING TO THE TOP OF ONE OF THE TOWERS TO RECONNOITRE SO UP THEY ALL WENT
THEY LOOKED AT ROBERT WITH SURPRISED RESPECT ANTHEA SAID YOU REALLY ARE BRAVE ROBERT ROT CYRIL'S PALLOR TURNED TO REDNESS NOW ALL IN A MINUTE
IT'S NO GOOD SAID ROBERT IN DEEP DEJECTION YOU'LL ONLY HULLO CYRIL STOOD UP WITH A GRIN OF TRIUMPH HOLDING A SQUARE PIECE OF BREAD IN HIS MOUTH IT WAS QUITE REAL EVERYONE SAW IT
BUT HAD THE DISCOURAGEMENT TO FIND THIS WAY OF LIVING SUNK ME EXCEEDINGLY AND THAT AS I HAD NO SETTLED INCOME SO SPENDING UPON THE MAIN STOCK WAS BUT A CERTAIN KIND OF BLEEDING TO DEATH AND THIS GAVE ME MANY SAD REFLECTIONS IN THE INTERVAL OF MY OTHER THOUGHTS
WHICH HE WAS SORRY FOR ASSURING ME THAT HE INQUIRED INTO IT WITH NO DESIGN TO SATISFY HIS OWN CURIOSITY BUT MERELY TO ASSIST ME IF THERE WAS ANY OCCASION BUT SINCE I
WHEN I HAD DONE SO HE MADE ME PUT THEM INTO MY LAP AND TOOK MY LITTLE DRAWER
NOT BY A GREAT DEAL WELL THEN HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE ME PROMISE TO GO AND FETCH HIM ALL THE MONEY I HAD EVERY FARTHING I TOLD HIM I WOULD AND I WENT INTO MY CHAMBER AND FETCHED HIM A LITTLE PRIVATE DRAWER
AND IN A WORD PRESSED ME TO BUY BETTER
BUT I MUST DO MYSELF JUSTICE AS TO PROTEST I KNEW NOTHING AMISS I MEANT NOTHING BUT IN AN HONEST WAY NOR HAD I ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT ME AT FIRST THAT LOOKED THE WAY WHICH AFTERWARDS I SUFFERED THEM TO BE GUIDED
I TOOK THE DIVERSION OF GOING TO THE BATH FOR AS I WAS STILL FAR FROM BEING OLD SO MY HUMOUR WHICH WAS ALWAYS GAY CONTINUED SO TO AN EXTREME AND BEING NOW AS IT WERE A WOMAN OF FORTUNE THOUGH I WAS A WOMAN WITHOUT A FORTUNE
WHERE THOUGH IT WAS REMOTE FROM OUR PORT
THE BREAKING OF HER MAINMAST SHE HAD GREAT DAMAGE ON BOARD AND THAT A GREAT PART OF HER CARGO WAS SPOILED I HAD NOW A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UPON MY HANDS AND A DREADFUL APPEARANCE IT HAD I WAS COME AWAY WITH A KIND OF FINAL FAREWELL
HE WAS IN A MIGHT GOOD HUMOUR WHEN HE HEARD ME SAY I HAD PAID HER AND IT WENT OFF INTO SOME OTHER DISCOURSE AT THAT TIME BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE HAVING HEARD ME UP ABOUT MY ROOM BEFORE HIM HE CALLED TO ME AND I ANSWERING HE ASKED ME TO COME INTO HIS CHAMBER
HE STARTS OUT OF HIS BED AND NOW MY DEAR SAYS HE YOU SHALL SEE HOW JUST I WILL BE TO YOU AND THAT I CAN KEEP MY WORD AND AWAY HE COMES TO MY BED I RESISTED A LITTLE BUT I MUST CONFESS I SHOULD NOT HAVE RESISTED HIM MUCH
HE HAD LEFT ALL HIS MONEY AND OTHER THINGS OF VALUE WITH ME AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM I DID NOT KNOW BUT I SECURED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD AND LOCKED UP THE LODGINGS AND WENT TO HIM WHERE I FOUND HIM VERY ILL INDEED HOWEVER I PERSUADED HIM TO BE CARRIED
AND FOR RECRUITS OF MONEY YET I CHOSE TO COME BACK TO BATH FOR MY RESIDENCE BECAUSE BEING ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED IN THE SUMMER I FOUND THAT DURING THE WINTER I LIVED RATHER CHEAPER THERE
AND HE HAD SUCH AN OPINION OF MY VIRTUE THAT AS HE OFTEN PROFESSED HE BELIEVED IF HE SHOULD OFFER ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD REJECT HIM WITH CONTEMPT HE SOON UNDERSTOOD FROM ME THAT I WAS A WIDOW THAT I HAD ARRIVED AT BRISTOL FROM VIRGINIA BY THE LAST SHIPS
I CONTRACTED AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH A WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED WHO THOUGH SHE DID NOT KEEP AN ILL HOUSE AS WE CALL IT YET HAD NONE OF THE BEST PRINCIPLES IN HERSELF I HAD ON ALL OCCASIONS BEHAVED MYSELF SO WELL
FROM THE DISTURBANCE OF SUCH A MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE AS THAT WAS MY LANDLADY WHO OF HER OWN ACCORD ENCOURAGED THE CORRESPONDENCE ON ALL OCCASIONS GAVE ME AN ADVANTAGEOUS CHARACTER OF HIM
AND SO I PUT OFF ALL ROOM FOR ANY OFFER FOR THE PRESENT HOWEVER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ATTACKED ME AGAIN
THE COMPANY BEGINNING TO WEAR AWAY AT THE BATH HE TALKED OF GOING AWAY
AS YOU SHALL HEAR IN ITS TIME I CAME AWAY FOR ENGLAND IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST AFTER I HAD BEEN EIGHT YEARS IN THAT COUNTRY AND NOW A NEW SCENE OF MISFORTUNES ATTENDED ME WHICH PERHAPS FEW WOMEN HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LIFE OF
WAS A GREAT WHILE AFTER THIS THAT I HAD OCCASION ON MY OWN BUSINESS TO GO TO BRISTOL UPON WHICH HE HIRED ME A COACH AND WOULD GO WITH ME AND DID SO AND NOW INDEED OUR INTIMACY INCREASED
AND INDEED FROM THAT TIME I DID NOT APPEAR SO MUCH RESERVED TO HIM AS I HAD DONE BEFORE THOUGH STILL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE STRICTEST VIRTUE ON BOTH SIDES BUT HOW FREE SOEVER OUR CONVERSATION WAS I COULD NOT ARRIVE TO THAT SORT OF FREEDOM
TO HAVE NO LODGING IN THE INN BUT IN ONE LARGE CHAMBER WITH TWO BEDS IN IT
AND INDEED WAS SO VERY KIND AS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF MY LIVING WITH HER TO SO LOW A PRICE DURING THE WINTER THAT SHE CONVINCED ME SHE GOT NOTHING BY ME AND AS FOR LODGING DURING THE WINTER I PAID NOTHING AT ALL
WHICH DREW QUITE ACROSS THE ROOM AND EFFECTUALLY DIVIDED THE BEDS WELL SAYS MY FRIEND VERY READILY THESE BEDS WILL DO AND AS FOR THE REST WE ARE TOO NEAR AKIN TO LIE TOGETHER THOUGH WE MAY LODGE NEAR ONE ANOTHER
AND CARRY IT ALL HOME INTO MY OWN CHAMBER I RELATE THIS STORY THE MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE GOOD HUMOUR THERE WAS IN IT AND TO SHOW THE TEMPER WITH WHICH WE CONVERSED
FOR A WICKED CORRESPONDENCE IF THEY HAD ANY OF THEM OFFERED IT YET THERE WAS ONE GENTLEMAN AS ABOVE WHO ALWAYS SINGLED ME OUT FOR THE DIVERSION OF MY COMPANY AS HE CALLED IT WHICH AS HE WAS PLEASED TO SAY WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO HIM BUT AT THAT TIME
AND SHE AGAIN USED TO TELL ME SHE BELIEVED IT WAS SO FROM THE BEGINNING HOWEVER SHE USED TO TELL ME THAT SHE THOUGHT I OUGHT TO EXPECT SOME GRATIFICATION FROM HIM FOR MY COMPANY FOR INDEED HE DID AS IT WERE ENGROSS ME AND I WAS SELDOM FROM HIM
CALLED SHEPTON WHERE HE HAD SOME BUSINESS AND WAS THERE TAKEN VERY ILL AND SO ILL THAT HE COULD NOT TRAVEL SO HE SENT HIS MAN BACK TO BATH TO BEG ME THAT I WOULD HIRE A COACH AND COME OVER TO HIM BEFORE HE WENT
LETTING HIM KNOW THAT I WAS STILL WITH HER BUT SHE DENIED IT AND PROTESTED TO ME THAT SHE DID NOT AND HE SAID THE SAME IN A WORD THIS GENTLEMAN CAME DOWN AND CONTINUED TO SINGLE ME OUT FOR HIS PECULIAR CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS CONVERSATION
TILL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO DO OTHERWISE SHE HAD SOME PERSONS OF CHARACTER THAT FREQUENTLY LODGED IN HER HOUSE AND IN PARTICULAR THE GENTLEMAN WHO AS I SAID SINGLED ME OUT FOR HIS COMPANION
CUT DOWN ALL WHO OPPOSED THEM AND SETTING FIRE TO THE HUTS RETIRED TOWARDS THE CITY BY THIS TIME THE FRENCH WERE THOROUGHLY ALARMED AND NUMBERS OF KNIGHTS AND MEN AT ARMS DASHED AFTER THE LITTLE BODY OF ENGLISH CAVALRY
AND THE REST OF THE PROVINCE IN THE VICINITY OF VANNES AND THEN LAID SIEGE TO THAT TOWN AS HIS FORCE WAS FAR MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR THE SIEGE THE EARLS OF NORFOLK AND WARWICK WERE DESPATCHED IN THE DIRECTION OF NANTES
WHO WERE FAST APPROACHING THEIR SHIPS IMPELLED BY A STRONG AND FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VESSELS OF THE FRENCH HASTILY DREW OFF AND THE ENGLISH FLEET SAILED INTO THE PORT HAILED BY THE CHEERS OF THE INHABITANTS THE COUNTESS HERSELF RECEIVED SIR WALTER MANNY
AND SIR JOHN POWIS THAT IT WAS AT HIS SUGGESTION THAT SHE HAD MADE THE SUDDEN ATTACK UPON THE FRENCH CAMP AND HE HAD GAINED GREAT CREDIT THEREBY THE EFFECT OF THE NEW MACHINES WAS SPEEDILY VISIBLE
EVERYONE IS INTENT ON HIS OWN PLEASURE AND WE SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN SLIPPING OUT OF THE CASTLE UNNOTICED
TO THE MAIN BODY OF THEIR FORCES THEY HAD PLACED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEIR BEST TROOPS ON THE WALLS GIVING THEM A HANDSOME LARGESS TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR LOSS OF THE FESTIVITIES
AND GROUPS OF MEN SAT ROUND THEM DRINKING AND SHOUTING MANY LAY ABOUT IN DRUNKEN SLEEP
THEN TURNING OFF FROM THE PRINCIPAL STREETS THEY MADE THEIR WAY BY QUIET LANES DOWN TO ONE OF THE GATES TO THEIR DISMAY THEY FOUND THAT THIS WAS CLOSED THE FRENCH COMMANDERS KNEW THAT SIR WALTER MANNY OR SALISBURY
IF HE WOULD BRING OVER THE OTHER COMMANDERS AND NOBLES THE WILY BISHOP SET TO WORK AND THE CONSEQUENCES WERE SOON VISIBLE OPEN GRUMBLING BROKE FORTH AT THE HARDSHIPS WHICH WERE ENDURED
AS THEY SAW THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME GREAT BREACHES WOULD BE MADE IN THE WALLS AND THAT ALL THE HORRORS AND DISASTERS OF A CITY TAKEN BY ASSAULT AWAITED THEM THE BISHOP OF QUIMPER WHO WAS WITHIN THE WALLS ENTERED INTO SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIS NEPHEW
BY WHICH IT WOULD NOT SLIP DOWN THE ROPE THEY MADE MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS
AND SWIM TO THE SIDE WITHOUT MAKING THE LEAST NOISE THEY MAY GIVE A FEW TURNS OF THE WINDLASS TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS HOLD OF THE ROPE BELOW BE SURE YOU DO NOT MAKE THE SLIGHTEST SPLASHING OR NOISE FOR THE SOUND WOULD BE HEARD ABOVE
WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY YOU KNOW WE WILL TAKE IT BY TURNS TO WATCH THAT LITTLE PATCH OF LIGHT OVERHEAD
CHAPTER NINE THE SIEGE OF HENNEBON THE BESIEGERS OF HENNEBON WERE GREATLY DISCOURAGED AT THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE OF THE COUNTESS THEY HAD ALREADY ATTEMPTED SEVERAL DESPERATE ASSAULTS
YOU HAD BEST LIE DOWN BY THE FOOT OF THE WALL ANYONE WHO PASSES WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE IN A DRUNKEN SLEEP
THE ENGLISH FLEET IS IN SIGHT MANY OTHERS HEARD THE SHOUT AND THE TIDINGS RAN LIKE LIGHTNING THROUGH THE TOWN IN WILD EXCITEMENT THE PEOPLE RAN TO THE BATTLEMENTS AND ROOFS AND WITH CHEERING
MANNED THE BREACHES AND REPULSED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ALL ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE FRENCH TO CARRY THEM WHILE THE STRUGGLE WAS STILL GOING ON THE COUNTESS AIDED BY THE WIVES OF THE BURGHERS BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARING A SUMPTUOUS FEAST IN HONOUR OF HER DELIVERERS
AND THEIR ENCAMPMENT WAS FLOODED THEIR FORCES WERE THEREFORE OBLIGATED TO SPREAD THEMSELVES OVER THE NEIGHBOURING FIELDS AND A SUDDEN ATTACK BY THE ENGLISH MIGHT HAVE BEEN FATAL THUS DISTRESS PRESSED UPON BOTH COMMANDERS
THEY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THEIR ASSAILANTS AND DASHED IN AT THE CASTLE GATE A CROWD OF THEIR ASSAILANTS WERE CLOSE UPON THEIR HEELS WALTER GLANCED ROUND DASHING ACROSS THE COURTYARD HE RAN THROUGH SOME PASSAGES INTO AN INNER YARD IN WHICH AS HE KNEW WAS THE WELL
WERE LEFT TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF HER PARTISANS WITH A SMALL BUT CHOICE BODY OF ENGLISH TROOPS THE TOWNS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO THEIR HANDS AND STILL REMAINED WERE BREST QUIMPER CORENTIN QUIMPERLE REDON
FOR WE MUST DIE HERE IF WE ARE NOT HAULED OUT I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T INTEND TO TRY AND CLIMB THAT ROPE I MIGHT DO TWENTY FEET OR SO ON A PINCH BUT I COULD NO MORE GET UP TO THE TOP THERE THAN I COULD FLY WE
WHO SUMMONED THE TOWN TO SURRENDER MANY STANDING ON THE WALLS SHOUTED THAT THE GATES SHOULD BE THROWN OPEN BUT SIR JOHN RETURNED FOR ANSWER THAT HE MUST CONSULT THE COUNTESS AND THAT UPON HER ANSWER MUST DEPEND WHETHER HE AND HIS MEN WOULD DEFEND THE BREACH UNTIL THE LAST
I HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU AND YOUR KNIGHTS SUCH A BANQUET OF WELCOME AS OUR POOR MEANS WILL ALLOW AND MY TOWNSPEOPLE WILL SEE THAT GOOD FARE IS SET BEFORE YOUR SOLDIERS
THERE WERE SIX STRANDS AND EACH HAS MADE SIX PIECES SO WE HAVE THIRTY SIX I KNOW THE WELL IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET DEEP
WHICH CRUISED OFF THE COAST AND CAPTURED ALL VESSELS ARRIVING WITH STORES AT THIS MOMENT TWO LEGATES
I WILL GO FIRST AT ANY RATE FOR A TIME I MUST PUT ONE LEG THROUGH THE LOOP AND SIT AS IT WERE WHILE I FASTEN THE ONE ABOVE AS I SHALL WANT BOTH HANDS FOR THE WORK YOU WILL FIND IT A GOOD DEAL EASIER TO STAND WITH YOUR FOOT IN THE LOOP
TO GET AT THE WINE BUTTS TO TROUBLE THEIR HEADS ABOUT THE MATTER BESIDES IT MUST BE A HEAVY JOB TO WIND UP THIS BUCKET AND IT IS NOT LIKELY THERE WILL BE SUCH URGENT NEED OF WATER THAT ANYONE WILL UNDERTAKE THE TASK
THAT SOME FOOD BE PLACED BEFORE US OR WE SHALL HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE FRENCH ONLY TO DIE OF HUNGER HERE WE HAVE TASTED NOUGHT SINCE THE ATTACK ON VANNES BEGAN HAVE ANY BESIDE US ESCAPED
AND HAVE SINCE DONE OUR BEST TO AID THE COUNTESS HERE AND THEIR BEST HAS BEEN MUCH THE COUNTESS SAID NOT TO SAY HOW BRAVELY THEY HAVE FOUGHT UPON THE WALLS IT IS TO SIR JOHN AND HIS LITTLE BAND THAT I OWE IT THAT THE TOWN WAS NOT SURRENDERED DAYS AGO
AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TIE THESE TO THE ROPE IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO SLIP DOWN WITH OUR WEIGHT IF WE TIE THEM FOUR FEET APART
HE HAD TO KEEP HIM FOR INSTANCE OUT OF POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS
UNLESS THE PERSON HAS HAPPENED TO OBSERVE IN PICTURES HOW IT IS THAT ARTISTS PRODUCE THESE EFFECTS HE WILL BE UTTERLY UNABLE TO MAKE THE SMALLEST APPROXIMATION TO IT YET WHY
JUMPED ONTO THE WINDOW SILL LISTEN CRIED HE STANDING THERE AND ADDRESSING THOSE IN THE ROOM ALL WERE SILENT
AND SO GUARDED AGAINST HIS HEART AND HAVING HIS NIECE WITH HIM HE WENT ROUND THE WORLD HE WASN'T OBTRUSIVE ABOUT HIS HEART YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN HE HAD ONE HE ONLY LEFT IT TO THE PHYSICAL LABORATORY AT WATERBURY FOR THE BENEFIT OF SCIENCE
WAS DRINKING ON THE SLY WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE GLASSES FROM THE THIRD ROOM CAME SOUNDS OF LAUGHTER THE SHOUTING OF FAMILIAR VOICES THE GROWLING OF A BEAR AND GENERAL COMMOTION
HE DESIRED SO PASSIONATELY ONCE MORE TO ENJOY THAT DISSIPATION HE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THAT HE DECIDED TO GO THE THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HIS PROMISE TO PRINCE ANDREW WAS OF NO ACCOUNT
AND I SHALL GO ON TALKING IN A LOW VOICE WHILE THE SEA SOUNDS IN THE DISTANCE AND OVERHEAD THE GREAT BLACK FLOOD OF WIND POLISHES THE BRIGHT STARS FROM TIME TO TIME WE SHALL GET UP AND GO TO THE DOOR AND LOOK OUT AT THE GREAT MOON AND SAY
HIS UNDERSTANDING WHICH INCLUDES NO INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAWS OF VISION CAN FURNISH HIM WITH NO REASON WHY A LINE WHICH IS KNOWN AND CAN BE PROVED TO BE A HORIZONTAL LINE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A HORIZONTAL LINE
DID ACTUALLY OCCUR WHICH THE GENIUS OF SHAKSPEARE HAS INVENTED AND ALL GOOD JUDGES AND THE MOST EMINENT DILETTANTI ACKNOWLEDGED THE FELICITY OF SHAKSPEARE'S SUGGESTION
FIFTY REPLIED THE LATTER ALL RIGHT FIFTY IMPERIALS THAT I WILL DRINK A WHOLE BOTTLE OF RUM WITHOUT TAKING IT FROM MY MOUTH SITTING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW ON THIS SPOT
TO REPRESENT THE EFFECT OF TWO WALLS STANDING AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER OR THE APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSES ON EACH SIDE OF A STREET AS SEEN BY A PERSON LOOKING DOWN THE STREET FROM ONE EXTREMITY NOW IN ALL CASES
I'LL DRINK IT LET'S HAVE A BOTTLE OF RUM SHOUTED PIERRE BANGING THE TABLE WITH A DETERMINED AND DRUNKEN GESTURE AND PREPARING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE WINDOW
AND IT STRUCK HIM THAT THE THINGS TO TAKE FOR THAT PURPOSE WERE ORANGES BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS THE ORANGE COUNTRY AND COMFORTABLE FOLDING CHAIRS SO HE BOUGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CASES OF ORANGES THE GREAT COOL CALIFORNIA ORANGES
FOR THE SAKE OF GRATIFYING HIS OWN ENORMOUS AND TEEMING FACULTY OF CREATION SHAKSPEARE HAS INTRODUCED TWO MURDERERS AND AS USUAL IN HIS HANDS THEY ARE REMARKABLY DISCRIMINATED
I KNOW I WAS FOR DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY WHOLE ATTENTIONS MY WHOLE ENDEAVOURS WERE TO KEEP POOR DEAR FLORENCE ON TO TOPICS LIKE THE FINDS AT CNOSSOS AND THE MENTAL SPIRITUALITY OF WALTER PATER
THE ANIMAL'S ACTION ITS HIGH STEPPING ITS SKIN THAT WAS LIKE SATIN AND THE PEACE AND THE RED CHEEKS AND THE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL OLD HOUSE JUST NEAR BRANSHAW TELERAGH IT WAS
THEY POLISHED HIM UP AND HER HUSBAND REMONSTRATED SERIOUSLY WITH HER VIDAL WAS YOU SEE A GREAT POET AND IT WAS NOT PROPER TO TREAT A GREAT POET WITH INDIFFERENCE SO PEIRE VIDAL DECLARED HIMSELF EMPEROR OF JERUSALEM OR SOMEWHERE
FOR HE HAS ACTUALLY SEEN THE EFFECT EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE THE REASON IS THAT HE ALLOWS HIS UNDERSTANDING TO OVERRULE HIS EYES
THAT IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THAT ANYTHING ESSENTIALLY CALAMITOUS COULD HAPPEN TO THAT PLACE AND THOSE PEOPLE I TELL YOU IT WAS THE VERY SPIRIT OF PEACE AND LEONORA BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING WITH HER COILS OF YELLOW HAIR
AND I HAD TO APPOINT TRUSTEES I DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF THEIR NOT BEING PROPERLY HANDLED YES IT WAS A GREAT WORRY AND JUST AS I HAD GOT THINGS ROUGHLY SETTLED I RECEIVED THE EXTRAORDINARY CABLE FROM ASHBURNHAM BEGGING ME TO COME BACK AND
AND I AGAIN SET MYSELF TO STUDY THE PROBLEM AT LENGTH I SOLVED IT TO MY OWN SATISFACTION AND MY SOLUTION IS THIS MURDER
STOOD ON THE TOP DOORSTEP WITH A BUTLER AND FOOTMAN AND A MAID OR SO BEHIND HER AND SHE JUST SAID SO GLAD YOU'VE COME AS IF I'D RUN DOWN TO LUNCH FROM A TOWN TEN MILES AWAY INSTEAD OF HAVING COME HALF THE WORLD OVER AT THE CALL OF TWO URGENT TELEGRAMS
A THIN YOUNG LAD AN HUSSAR OF THE LIFE GUARDS WHO HAD BEEN LOSING THAT EVENING CLIMBED ON THE WINDOW SILL LEANED OVER AND LOOKED DOWN OH OH OH HE MUTTERED
AND MADE APPREHENSIBLE BY REACTION NOW APPLY THIS TO THE CASE IN MACBETH HERE AS I HAVE SAID
THERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DOING SINCE HIS TIME OR NOTHING THAT'S WORTH SPEAKING OF BUT THIS IS WRONG FOR IT IS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT ALL MEN TO BE GREAT ARTISTS AND BORN WITH THE GENIUS OF MISTER WILLIAMS
IT HAD CERTAINLY JUMPED OR SQUEAKED OR SOMETHING JUST SUFFICIENTLY TO TAKE IN THE DOCTORS BUT IT APPEARS THAT THAT WAS BECAUSE OF AN ODD FORMATION OF THE LUNGS I DON'T MUCH UNDERSTAND ABOUT THESE MATTERS
THESE FELLOWS MUST BE VERY LONELY LET'S TAKE THEM SOME ORANGES SO HE HAD A BOATLOAD OF HIS FRUIT OUT AND HAD HIMSELF ROWED TO THE LIGHTHOUSE ON THE HORIZON THE FOLDING CHAIRS HE LENT TO ANY LADY THAT HE CAME ACROSS AND LIKED OR WHO SEEMED TIRED AND INVALIDISH ON THE SHIP
THE FACT IS THAT THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN WITH HIS WEAK AND FLUTTERING HEART DIDN'T WANT HIS FACTORY TO MANUFACTURE ANYTHING AT ALL HE WANTED TO RETIRE AND HE DID RETIRE WHEN HE WAS SEVENTY BUT HE WAS SO WORRIED AT HAVING ALL THE STREET BOYS IN THE TOWN POINT AFTER HIM AND EXCLAIM
IF THE READER HAS EVER WITNESSED A WIFE DAUGHTER OR SISTER IN A FAINTING FIT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT WAIT A BIT HE IS NOT DRUNK YET A BOTTLE HERE SAID ANATOLE TAKING A GLASS FROM THE TABLE HE WENT UP TO PIERRE FIRST OF ALL YOU MUST DRINK PIERRE DRANK ONE GLASS AFTER ANOTHER
MACUMAZAHN HE HALLOED DON'T YOU KNOW ME BAAS I'M JIM THE HUNTER I LOST THE NOTE YOU GAVE ME TO GIVE TO THE BAAS
AND SO GEORGE CURTIS ENDED WE HAVE LIVED FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS LIKE A SECOND ROBINSON CRUSOE AND HIS MAN FRIDAY HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT SOME NATIVES MIGHT COME HERE TO HELP US AWAY BUT NONE HAVE COME
AND HAVING SPOKEN TO GOOD I TOLD SIR HENRY THAT IT WAS OUR JOINT WISH THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A THIRD PORTION OF THE DIAMONDS OR IF HE WOULD NOT THAT HIS SHARE SHOULD BE HANDED TO HIS BROTHER WHO HAD SUFFERED EVEN MORE THAN OURSELVES ON THE CHANCE OF GETTING THEM
A KAFIR CAME UP MY AVENUE OF ORANGE TREES CARRYING A LETTER IN A CLEFT STICK WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT FROM THE POST IT TURNED OUT TO BE FROM SIR HENRY AND AS IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF I GIVE IT IN FULL
IF IT IS ONLY TO SEE YOU HARRY MY BOY AND TO LOOK AFTER THE PRINTING OF THIS HISTORY WHICH IS A TASK THAT I DO NOT LIKE TO TRUST TO ANYBODY ELSE
LET SOME MAN COME AND STRIKE YOU IN THE FACE WHILST YOU ARE ENJOYING THAT MARVELLOUS LOOKING DISH AND WE SHALL SOON SEE HOW MUCH OF THE SAVAGE THERE IS IN YOU
FROM THAT DAY HE HAD BEEN SO LAME THAT HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GO EITHER FORWARD OR BACK
ITS STIFF FORMAL MANNERS AND ITS WELL DRESSED CROWDS HE BEGINS TO LONG AH HOW HE LONGS FOR THE KEEN BREATH OF THE DESERT AIR
THERE I MIGHT GO ON FOR EVER BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD CIVILIZATION IS ONLY SAVAGERY SILVER GILT A VAINGLORY IS IT
I LONGED ONCE MORE TO THROW MYSELF INTO THE ARMS OF NATURE NOT THE NATURE WHICH YOU KNOW THE NATURE THAT WAVES IN WELL KEPT WOODS AND SMILES OUT IN CORN FIELDS BUT NATURE
UP AND DOWN THE OAK PANELLED VESTIBULE FOR THERE IS A VESTIBULE IN MY HOUSE IN ENGLAND ON ALL THE FOUR WALLS OF THIS VESTIBULE WERE PLACED PAIRS OF HORNS ABOUT A HUNDRED PAIRS ALTOGETHER
I TRIED TO CROSS SOLOMON'S MOUNTAINS NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO WAS THE ANSWER SPOKEN IN THE HESITATING VOICE OF A MAN WHO HAS HAD LITTLE RECENT OPPORTUNITY OF USING HIS TONGUE BUT WHEN I REACHED HERE
EVEN AS I SAID IT THE DOOR OF THE HUT OPENED AND THERE LIMPED OUT OF IT A WHITE MAN CLOTHED IN SKINS AND WITH AN ENORMOUS BLACK BEARD I THOUGHT THAT I MUST HAVE GOT A TOUCH OF THE SUN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
AND MANY OTHER BOYS WHOM I SHALL NEVER KNOW MAY IN THE ACTS AND THOUGHTS OF ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS
WHEREBY YOU WILL MAKE IT BULGE OUT THE OTHER BUT YOU WILL NEVER WHILE THE WORLD ENDURES AND MAN IS MAN INCREASE ITS TOTAL CIRCUMFERENCE IT IS THE ONE FIXED UNCHANGEABLE THING
HE TOLD ME THAT SINCE HE HAD BEEN HOME HE HADN'T SEEN A WOMAN TO TOUCH HER EITHER AS REGARDS HER FIGURE OR THE SWEETNESS OF HER EXPRESSION I WANT YOU TO COME HOME MY DEAR OLD COMRADE
AND REALLY I AM AFRAID TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY PUT THEM AT IT SEEMS SO ENORMOUS
AND ONE WHICH SHOWS HOW WONDERFULLY THINGS ARE BROUGHT ABOUT I WAS WALKING ALONG QUIETLY SOME WAY IN FRONT OF THE OTHER TWO DOWN THE BANKS OF THE STREAM WHICH RUNS FROM THE OASIS TILL IT IS SWALLOWED UP IN THE HUNGRY DESERT SANDS
FOR FEAR LEST WE SHOULD FLOOD THE MARKET THEY OFFER HOWEVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FOR A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THEM YOU MUST COME HOME QUATERMAIN AND SEE ABOUT THESE THINGS
APPLIED FOR THE GOOD OF ALL OF COURSE THEY HAVE GREAT ADVANTAGES HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE BUT THEN REMEMBER WE BREED THE SICKLY PEOPLE WHO FILL THEM IN A SAVAGE LAND THEY DO NOT EXIST
AND KICKED LIKE THE VERY DEUCE WELL UP AND DOWN I WALKED STARING AT THE GUNS AND THE HORNS WHICH THE GUNS HAD BROUGHT LOW AND AS I DID SO THERE ROSE UP IN ME A GREAT CRAVING
SAW US ALL ONCE MORE SAFE AND SOUND AT MY LITTLE PLACE ON THE BEREA NEAR DURBAN WHERE I AM NOW WRITING
YOUR FONDNESS FOR PIGMENTS AND POWDERS THE WAY IN WHICH YOU LOVE TO SUBJUGATE YOURSELF TO THE RICH WARRIOR WHO HAS CAPTURED YOU IN MARRIAGE AND THE QUICKNESS WITH WHICH YOUR TASTE IN FEATHERED HEAD DRESSES VARIES
NINETEEN SAVAGE AND ONE CIVILIZED WE MUST LOOK TO THE NINETEEN SAVAGE PORTIONS OF OUR NATURE IF WE WOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND OURSELVES AND NOT TO THE TWENTIETH
AND WANTED TO GAIN THE EXPERIENCE AND NOW THE DISEASE HAS KILLED HIM AND I OLD AND GREY AND WITHERED AM LEFT TO MOURN OVER HIM WITHOUT A CHICK OR CHILD TO COMFORT ME
I MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIM TOO I HAVE MONEY ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US AND MUCH MORE THAN ENOUGH KING SOLOMON'S MINES PROVIDED ME WITH THAT BUT I SAID NO LET THE BOY EARN HIS LIVING LET HIM LABOUR
WHEN SUDDENLY I STOPPED AND RUBBED MY EYES AS WELL I MIGHT THERE NOT TWENTY YARDS IN FRONT OF ME PLACED IN A CHARMING SITUATION UNDER THE SHADE OF A SPECIES OF FIG TREE
AND SO MANY THINGS GOOD BAD AND INDIFFERENT HAD HAPPENED TO ME THE THIRST FOR THE WILDERNESS WAS ON ME I COULD TOLERATE THIS PLACE NO MORE I WOULD GO AND DIE AS I HAD LIVED
GOOD FEED AND FAIR REST WILL KEEP UP ONE'S STRENGTH UNDER FULL WORK BUT NO HORSE CAN STAND AGAINST OVERLOADING AND I WAS GETTING SO THOROUGHLY PULLED DOWN FROM THIS CAUSE
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG SIR SAID JOHN AND HE SPRANG OUT OF THE DOG CART AND CAME TO MY HEAD AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HE TRIED TO LEAD ME FORWARD COME ON BEAUTY WHAT'S THE MATTER
I HEARD NO MORE AS THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND JOHN TOOK ME TO THE STABLE OH WHAT A GOOD SUPPER HE GAVE ME THAT NIGHT A GOOD BRAN MASH AND SOME CRUSHED BEANS WITH MY OATS AND SUCH A THICK BED OF STRAW
AT THIS SALE OF COURSE I FOUND MYSELF IN COMPANY WITH THE OLD BROKEN DOWN HORSES SOME LAME SOME BROKEN WINDED SOME OLD AND SOME THAT I AM SURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERCIFUL TO SHOOT
A THIRD TIME HE WAS FLOGGING ME CRUELLY WHEN A LADY STEPPED QUICKLY UP TO HIM AND SAID IN A SWEET EARNEST VOICE
I BELIEVE HAD I STAYED THERE VERY LONG I SHOULD HAVE BECOME PURBLIND AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR I HAVE HEARD MEN SAY THAT A STONE BLIND HORSE WAS SAFER TO DRIVE THAN ONE WHICH HAD IMPERFECT SIGHT
AND BOX AFTER BOX WAS DRAGGED UP AND LODGED ON THE TOP OF THE CAB OR SETTLED BY THE SIDE OF THE DRIVER AT LAST ALL WAS READY AND WITH HIS USUAL JERK AT THE REIN AND SLASH OF THE WHIP
SOME OF THEM LOOKED AS IF POVERTY AND HARD TIMES HAD HARDENED THEM ALL OVER BUT THERE WERE OTHERS THAT I WOULD HAVE WILLINGLY USED THE LAST OF MY STRENGTH IN SERVING POOR AND SHABBY BUT KIND AND HUMAN
POOR OLD FELLOW SAID THE BOY DO YOU THINK GRANDPAPA HE WAS EVER A CARRIAGE HORSE OH YES MY BOY SAID THE FARMER COMING CLOSER HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANYTHING WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
THERE WAS A PARTY OF FOUR A NOISY BLUSTERING MAN WITH A LADY
I FOUND THE WORK TELLING VERY MUCH ON MY STRENGTH ONE DAY I WAS LOADED MORE THAN USUAL AND PART OF THE ROAD WAS A STEEP UPHILL I USED ALL MY STRENGTH
BLESS THE BOY HE IS AS HORSEY AS HIS OLD GRANDFATHER BUT DO LOOK AT HIS MOUTH GRANDPAPA AND ASK THE PRICE I AM SURE HE WOULD GROW YOUNG IN OUR MEADOWS
THANK GOD SAID MY MASTER YOU BEAUTY SAID JOHN AND TOOK THE BRIDLE AND GENTLY TURNED ME ROUND TO THE RIGHT HAND ROAD BY THE RIVER SIDE THE SUN HAD SET SOME TIME
HE CALLED ME OLD CRONY AS I USED TO COME TO HIM IN THE FIELD AND FOLLOW HIM ABOUT SOMETIMES HE BROUGHT HIS GRANDFATHER WHO ALWAYS LOOKED CLOSELY AT MY LEGS THIS IS OUR POINT WILLIE
LOOK AT HIS MANE AND TAIL I WISH YOU WOULD LOOK INTO HIS MOUTH AND THEN YOU COULD TELL THOUGH HE IS SO VERY THIN HIS EYES ARE NOT SUNK LIKE SOME OLD HORSES THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED
I GIVE HIM IN CHARGE TO YOU THE BOY WAS PROUD OF HIS CHARGE AND UNDERTOOK IT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THERE WAS NOT A DAY WHEN HE DID NOT PAY ME A VISIT SOMETIMES PICKING ME OUT FROM AMONG THE OTHER HORSES
DO SO I AM NOW GOING THERE THEY WALKED FORWARD AND I WAS LED BEHIND THE BOY COULD HARDLY CONTROL HIS DELIGHT AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEEMED TO ENJOY HIS PLEASURE I HAD A GOOD FEED AT THE INN
I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MUCH OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT I FOUND THEY THOUGHT IF I HAD GONE ON AS THE MASTER WANTED ME MOST LIKELY THE BRIDGE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WAY UNDER US AND HORSE CHAISE MASTER
THE LADY HAD WALKED ALONG THE FOOTPATH AND NOW CAME ACROSS INTO THE ROAD SHE STROKED AND PATTED MY NECK AS I HAD NOT BEEN PATTED FOR MANY A LONG DAY YOU SEE HE
I PUT OUT MY NOSE IN ANSWER TO HIS KINDNESS THE BOY STROKED MY FACE POOR OLD FELLOW SEE GRANDPAPA HOW WELL HE UNDERSTANDS KINDNESS
I WILL NEVER SAY I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED FOR I WAS I STOPPED STILL AND I BELIEVE I TREMBLED OF COURSE I DID NOT TURN ROUND OR RUN AWAY I WAS NOT BROUGHT UP TO THAT JOHN JUMPED OUT
I COULD HEAR A POLICEMAN GIVING ORDERS BUT I DID NOT EVEN OPEN MY EYES I COULD ONLY DRAW A GASPING BREATH NOW AND THEN SOME COLD WATER WAS THROWN OVER MY HEAD
I HAD STILL A GOOD MANE AND TAIL WHICH DID SOMETHING FOR MY APPEARANCE I PRICKED MY EARS AND LOOKED AT HIM THERE'S A HORSE WILLIE THAT HAS KNOWN BETTER DAYS
WERE HARD ON THE HORSES IN THIS PLACE WE HAD NO SUNDAY REST
HE WAS RAISING THE WHIP AGAIN WHEN THE LADY SAID
BESIDES SHE ADDED IN A VERY SERIOUS VOICE WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO DISTRESS ANY OF GOD'S CREATURES
THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF RAIN AND NOW THE WIND WAS VERY HIGH AND BLEW THE DRY LEAVES ACROSS THE ROAD IN A SHOWER WE WENT ALONG MERRILY TILL WE CAME TO THE TOLL BAR AND THE LOW WOODEN BRIDGE
AND ENCOURAGING ME TO RISE AFTER SOME MORE CORDIAL HAD BEEN GIVEN ME AND AFTER ONE OR TWO ATTEMPTS I STAGGERED TO MY FEET AND WAS GENTLY LED TO SOME STABLES WHICH WERE CLOSE BY
WHICH HE ALSO TOOK FURTHER ON
ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED TO APPEAR BEFORE MY EYES I WILL SEND YOU TO A THIRD MASTER BUT IF YOU LEARN NOTHING THIS TIME ALSO I WILL NO LONGER BE YOUR FATHER THE YOUTH REMAINED A WHOLE YEAR WITH THE THIRD MASTER ALSO
INTO THE COURT BELOW A HEIGHT OF THIRTY FEET HE BROKE HIS LEG IN THE FALL AND FAINTED THE INSURGENTS SPEEDILY FOUND HIM DRAGGED HIM MID CURSES AND BLOWS INTO THE PALACE
NOT ONLY DID VOLDEMAR'S RELATIVES THE DUKE OF SAXONY AND THE PRINCES OF ANHALT AND THAT APPARENTLY CONTRARY TO THEIR INTEREST ACKNOWLEDGE THE WANDERER BUT THEY EVEN
AFTER LYING EXPOSED FOR SOME DAYS WAS UNCEREMONIOUSLY BURIED WITHOUT THE WALLS THEN DISINTERRED AND BURNT THE ASHES COLLECTED AND TO MAKE SURE OF NO FURTHER RESUSCITATION
THE STATEMENT AS TO HIS DECEASE IN THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO IS THEY POINT OUT CONTRADICTORY WHILST HAD THE ELECTOR LOUIS KNOWN OF HIS PREDECESSOR'S DEATH WHY DID HE NOT PROCURE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF THE SAME
DEMETRIUS NOW SET TO WORK TO GOVERN WITH HUMANITY AND JUSTICE BOTH QUALITIES QUITE UNSUITED TO RUSSIAN TASTES WHO SOON GREW AS TIRED OF THEIR NEW CZAR AS THEY HAD BEEN OF HIS PREDECESSORS
THE WATER OF LIFE LONG BEFORE YOU OR I WERE BORN THERE REIGNED IN A COUNTRY A GREAT WAY OFF A KING WHO HAD THREE SONS THIS KING
THE PRINCE BEGGED SO HARD FOR HIS BROTHERS THAT THE DWARF AT LAST SET THEM FREE THOUGH UNWILLINGLY SAYING BEWARE OF THEM FOR THEY HAVE BAD HEARTS THEIR BROTHER HOWEVER
THE KING OF DENMARK WHO SINGULARLY ENOUGH WAS ALSO NAMED VOLDEMAR AND BY SOME OTHER POTENTATES EQUALLY DESIROUS OF HAVING A HAND IN THEIR NEIGHBOUR'S AFFAIRS HE SOON FOUND HIMSELF ABLE TO PLACE A GOOD ARMY IN THE FIELD
SLAY WHOLE ARMIES AND THE BREAD WILL NEVER FAIL YOU THEN THE PRINCE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I CANNOT GO HOME TO MY FATHER WITHOUT MY BROTHERS SO HE SAID MY DEAR FRIEND CANNOT YOU TELL ME WHERE MY TWO BROTHERS ARE
AND A VALUABLE JEWELLED CROSS THIS WAS IN THE SUMMER OF SIXTEEN O THREE WHEN DEMETRIUS IF LIVING WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT TWENTY TWO AN AGE APPARENTLY CORRESPONDING WITH THAT OF THE CLAIMANT TO HIS NAME
AND I AM GLAD THAT I HAD PITY ON HIM BUT LET HIM GO IN PEACE AND BROUGHT HOME HIS ROYAL COAT AT THIS THE KING WAS OVERWHELMED WITH JOY AND MADE IT KNOWN THROUGHOUT ALL HIS KINGDOM
LET ME LIVE AND I WILL CHANGE DRESSES WITH YOU YOU SHALL TAKE MY ROYAL COAT TO SHOW TO MY FATHER AND DO YOU GIVE ME YOUR SHABBY ONE WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE HUNTSMAN I AM SURE I SHALL BE GLAD TO SAVE YOU
BOUNTIFULLY WITH GOODS AND MONEY AND RENDERED HIM EVERY ASSISTANCE TOWARDS DRIVING OUT LOUIS ALMOST ALL THE TOWNS AND CITIES ACKNOWLEDGED HIS AUTHORITY AND PROMISED OBEDIENCE TO HIS RULE
AND HE FOUND HIMSELF UNABLE TO MOVE A STEP AND THUS HE WAS FORCED TO ABIDE SPELLBOUND MEANTIME
YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR LIFE INTO THE BARGAIN BUT BE QUIET AND WE WILL LET YOU OFF
AND BLAMED THE YOUNGEST FOR WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND SAID THAT HE WANTED TO POISON THEIR FATHER BUT THAT THEY HAD FOUND THE WATER OF LIFE AND HAD BROUGHT IT WITH THEM HE NO SOONER BEGAN TO DRINK OF WHAT THEY BROUGHT HIM THAN HE FELT HIS SICKNESS LEAVE HIM
THE HISTORY OF THIS ADVENTURER IS RENDERED MORE THAN USUALLY INTERESTING FROM THE FACT THAT SEVERAL AUTHORS HAVE TAKEN UP CUDGELS ON HIS BEHALF AND VEHEMENTLY ASSERT THAT HE WAS TRULY
AND WHEN THE LIONS WERE QUIETED HE WENT ON THROUGH THE CASTLE AND CAME AT LENGTH TO A BEAUTIFUL HALL AROUND IT HE SAW SEVERAL KNIGHTS SITTING IN A TRANCE THEN HE PULLED OFF THEIR RINGS
THEY RECEIVED HIM BACK WITH TRANSPORTS OF JOY SUCH WAS THEIR ENTHUSIASM
THE PRINCE THANKED HIS LITTLE FRIEND WITH THE SCARLET CLOAK FOR HIS FRIENDLY AID
SHUISKI THEN PRETENDED TO HAVE DISCOVERED THE BODY OF YOUNG DEMETRIUS IN THE RUINS OF UGLITCH AND HIS CLERICAL FRIENDS CONTRIVED A MIRACLE FOR THE OCCASION WHEN THE BODY WAS BROUGHT TO MOSCOW
THAT THEY MIGHT CARRY THEM TO THE OLD MAN AS A TOKEN THE YOUTH WANDERED ON AND AFTER SOME TIME CAME TO A FORTRESS WHERE HE BEGGED FOR A NIGHT'S LODGING YES SAID THE LORD OF THE CASTLE IF YOU WILL PASS THE NIGHT
THE MAN HE ASSERTED HIMSELF TO BE NOT ONLY AUTHORS INK BUT UNFORTUNATELY A GREAT QUANTITY OF HUMAN BLOOD WAS WASTED IN THE DISPUTE AND THAT TOO
SAID HE BUT THE PRINCE BEGGED VERY HARD AND SAID ONLY TELL ME WHAT IT IS AND DO NOT THINK I SHALL BE ANGRY FOR I WILL FORGIVE YOU ALAS SAID THE HUNTSMAN THE KING HAS ORDERED ME TO SHOOT YOU
SO THAT HE DID NOT WAKE UP TILL THE CLOCK WAS STRIKING A QUARTER TO TWELVE THEN HE SPRANG FROM THE COUCH DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED RAN TO THE WELL FILLED A CUP THAT WAS STANDING BY HIM FULL OF WATER AND HASTENED TO GET AWAY IN TIME
LORD HAVE MERCY ON US CRIED THE FATHER IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE LEARNT I WILL SEND YOU INTO ANOTHER TOWN TO ANOTHER MASTER THE YOUTH WAS TAKEN THITHER AND STAYED A YEAR WITH THIS MASTER LIKEWISE
THE SLOVENLY WAY IN WHICH THE INQUIRY HAD BEEN MADE THE FACT THAT IT HAD BEEN CONDUCTED BY CREATURES OF BORIS THAT THE BODY WAS NEVER EXAMINED NOR THE KNIFE COMPARED WITH THE WOUND TOGETHER WITH THE ATTEMPTED OBLITERATION OF ALL SURROUNDING DWELLINGS
AND LEAVING THE LITTLE PROPERTY OF WHICH HE WAS POSSESSED TO THOSE WHOM HE MOST DESIRED TO BENEFIT THE FRIEND IN WHOSE HOUSE HE WAS LOCATED WITNESSED HIS TESTAMENT HE DESIRED TO BE BURIED WITH A LITTLE
PITY SOME PEOPLE ARE SO KNOWING ALL THESE TWOPENNY DOCUMENTS ARRANGED ON A SIDE TABLE OLD SEDLEY COVERED THEM CAREFULLY OVER WITH A CLEAN BANDANNA HANDKERCHIEF ONE OUT OF MAJOR DOBBIN'S LOT
SHE SLEPT THEREFORE VERY SOUNDLY THAT EVENING AFTER THE CONVERSATION WITH MISS POLLY AND WAS MORE THAN ORDINARILY HAPPY IN SPITE OF JOS'S DELAYING
BETTER DAYS AS FAR AS WORLDLY PROSPERITY WENT WERE IN STORE FOR BOTH PERHAPS THE INGENIOUS READER HAS GUESSED WHO WAS THE STOUT GENTLEMAN WHO CALLED UPON GEORGY AT HIS SCHOOL IN COMPANY WITH OUR OLD FRIEND MAJOR DOBBIN
THAT GEORGE'S MATERNAL GRANDFATHER WAS BUT A WRETCHED OLD BANKRUPT AND DEPENDANT AND THAT JOHN SEDLEY MIGHT THANK THE MAN TO WHOM HE ALREADY OWED EVER SO MUCH MONEY
WE COULD NOT BE SO AFFECTED AND SO IF YOU PROPERLY TYRANNIZE OVER A WOMAN
OR A MOUSE TO COME OUT AND PLAY ABOUT LATUDE'S
AND RENDERED HIMSELF SO GAY
THOUGH I WISHED AND PRAYED FOR YOU TO COME AND THEY TOOK HIM TOO AWAY FROM ME ISN'T HE A NOBLE BOY WILLIAM BE HIS FRIEND STILL AND MINE AND HERE HER VOICE BROKE AND SHE HID HER FACE ON HIS SHOULDER
HOW ELEGANT HOW GENTLE SHE WAS AND OF WHAT REFINED GOOD MANNERS
IS PLEASED SO TO HUMILIATE AND CAST DOWN THE TENDER GOOD AND WISE AND TO SET UP THE SELFISH THE FOOLISH OR THE WICKED OH BE HUMBLE MY BROTHER IN YOUR PROSPERITY BE GENTLE WITH THOSE WHO ARE LESS LUCKY IF NOT MORE DESERVING THINK WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO BE SCORNFUL
TO LAY BY A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY HE WAS FREE TO COME HOME AND STAY WITH A GOOD PENSION OR TO RETURN AND RESUME THAT RANK IN THE SERVICE TO WHICH HIS SENIORITY AND HIS VAST TALENTS ENTITLED HIM
AND THE REFRESHMENT OF BRANDY PAWNEE WHICH HE WAS FORCED TO TAKE THERE
O YOU POOR SECRET MARTYRS AND VICTIMS WHOSE LIFE IS A TORTURE WHO ARE STRETCHED ON RACKS IN YOUR BEDROOMS AND WHO LAY YOUR HEADS DOWN ON THE BLOCK DAILY AT THE DRAWING ROOM TABLE
IT WAS CHIEFLY FROM A DREAD LEST THEY SHOULD MAKE LOVE TO HIM THAT HE AVOIDED THEM BEING AVERSE TO MARRIAGE ALTOGETHER BUT THERE WAS NO SUCH SWELL IN CALCUTTA AS WATERLOO SEDLEY I HAVE HEARD SAY AND HE HAD THE HANDSOMEST TURN OUT GAVE THE BEST BACHELOR DINNERS
AMELIA AS SHE READ OUT THE LETTER TO HER FATHER PAUSED OVER THE LATTER WORD HER BROTHER IT WAS CLEAR DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE FAMILY NOR COULD HE FOR THE FACT IS
THE NEXT TIME THAT OLD SEDLEY ASKED HER TO PLAY SHE SAID IT WAS SHOCKINGLY OUT OF TUNE THAT SHE HAD A HEADACHE THAT SHE COULDN'T PLAY THEN ACCORDING TO HER CUSTOM SHE REBUKED HERSELF
BUT WHICH SHE LOVED FOR REASONS OF HER OWN SHE WAS A CHILD WHEN FIRST SHE PLAYED ON IT AND HER PARENTS GAVE IT HER IT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HER AGAIN SINCE AS THE READER MAY REMEMBER WHEN HER FATHER'S HOUSE WAS GONE TO RUIN AND THE INSTRUMENT WAS RECOVERED OUT OF THE WRECK
I LOVED YOU THEN AS I DO NOW I MUST TELL YOU I THINK I LOVED YOU FROM THE FIRST MINUTE THAT I SAW YOU WHEN GEORGE BROUGHT ME TO YOUR HOUSE TO SHOW ME THE AMELIA WHOM HE WAS ENGAGED TO YOU WERE BUT A GIRL IN WHITE WITH LARGE RINGLETS YOU CAME DOWN SINGING DO YOU REMEMBER
HAVING PARTAKEN OF A COPIOUS BREAKFAST WITH FISH AND RICE AND HARD EGGS AT SOUTHAMPTON HE HAD SO FAR RALLIED AT WINCHESTER AS TO THINK
IT WAS A MATTER OF GREAT DELIGHT AND OCCUPATION TO JOS TO SUPERINTEND THE BUILDING OF A SMART CHARIOT WHICH HE AND THE MAJOR ORDERED IN THE NEIGHBOURING LONG ACRE AND A PAIR OF HANDSOME HORSES WERE JOBBED WITH WHICH JOS DROVE ABOUT IN STATE IN THE PARK
OR YOU AND I HOWEVER OLD SCOLDING AND BANKRUPT MAY WE HAVE IN OUR LAST DAYS A KIND SOFT SHOULDER ON WHICH TO LEAN AND A GENTLE HAND TO SOOTHE OUR GOUTY OLD PILLOWS
CRIED HOORAY AND MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MUST BE A GOVERNOR GENERAL HE I PROMISE DID NOT DECLINE THE OBSEQUIOUS INVITATION OF THE LANDLORDS TO ALIGHT AND REFRESH HIMSELF IN THE NEAT COUNTRY TOWNS
I AM HIS NOW AS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME DEAR WILLIAM IT WAS HE WHO TOLD ME HOW GOOD AND GENEROUS YOU WERE AND WHO TAUGHT ME TO LOVE YOU AS A BROTHER HAVE YOU NOT BEEN EVERYTHING TO ME AND MY BOY OUR DEAREST TRUEST KINDEST FRIEND AND PROTECTOR
LISTENED TO HIS STORIES WITH UNTIRING SMILES AND AFFECTIONATE HYPOCRISY OR SAT MUSING BY HIS SIDE AND COMMUNING WITH HER OWN THOUGHTS AND REMINISCENCES AS THE OLD MAN FEEBLE AND QUERULOUS SUNNED HIMSELF ON THE GARDEN BENCHES AND PRATTLED ABOUT HIS WRONGS OR HIS SORROWS
HIS CHESTS OF MANGOES CHUTNEY AND CURRY POWDERS HIS SHAWLS FOR PRESENTS TO PEOPLE WHOM HE DIDN'T KNOW AS YET AND THE REST OF HIS PERSICOS APPARATUS AT LENGTH HE DROVE LEISURELY TO LONDON ON THE THIRD DAY AND IN THE NEW WAISTCOAT
OF STEWED EELS VEAL CUTLETS AND FRENCH BEANS WITH A BOTTLE OF CLARET HE WAS COLD OVER BAGSHOT HEATH WHERE THE NATIVE CHATTERED MORE AND MORE
WHO TOLD YOU THOSE LIES OH M'AM POLLY SAID
THOUGHT HE COULD NOT GO TO TOWN UNTIL HE WAS SUPPLIED WITH ONE OR TWO OF THESE GARMENTS AND SELECTED A CRIMSON SATIN EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD BUTTERFLIES AND A BLACK AND RED VELVET TARTAN WITH WHITE STRIPES AND A ROLLING COLLAR
AND IN LONDON WHERE SHE WAS MUCH ADMIRED BY PEOPLE OF VERY GREAT FASHION AND HE THEN HINTED HOW BECOMING IT WOULD BE FOR JOS TO SEND GEORGY TO A GOOD SCHOOL AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM FOR HIS MOTHER AND HER PARENTS WOULD BE SURE TO SPOIL HIM
LITTLE POLLY WAS TOO YOUNG MISSUS OSBORNE COULD NOT FIND ANYBODY TO SUIT THE MAJOR BEFORE SHE WENT TO SLEEP THE SAME MORNING
THE CIVILIAN WAS THEREFORE AN EASY VICTIM TO THE GUILELESS ARTS OF THIS GOOD NATURED DIPLOMATIST AND WAS READY TO DO TO PURCHASE HIRE OR RELINQUISH WHATEVER HIS FRIEND THOUGHT FIT LOLL JEWAB
HER LITTLE BOY SAT BY HER SIDE IN POMPOUS NEW SABLES SHE REMEMBERED THE OLD PEW WOMAN AND CLERK HER THOUGHTS WERE AWAY IN OTHER TIMES AS THE PARSON READ BUT THAT SHE HELD GEORGE'S HAND IN HER OWN PERHAPS SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO CHANGE PLACES WITH
IF ABLE TO SUGGEST A HINT ISABELLA COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT IN THIS DISTRESS THE INTENDED DEPARTURE OF THE TILNEY FAMILY BECAME HER CHIEF CONSOLATION THEIR JOURNEY INTO GLOUCESTERSHIRE WAS TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN A FEW DAYS
CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE IT THEY EVEN GOT THE DOCTOR SOME TOBACCO ONE DAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED WHAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND WANTED TO SMOKE
AND SO DID ALL OF THEM JOHN DOLITTLE WAS THE LAST TO CROSS AND JUST AS HE WAS GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUSHING UP TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THEN THEY SHOOK THEIR FISTS AND YELLED WITH RAGE
WHEN THE COMMON ROOMS AND CORRIDORS WOULD BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE GREAT DOGS WHO KEPT WATCH THERE THROUGH THE NIGHT THE PRISONERS WERE FAR FROM INSENSIBLE OR UNFEELING THEIR WAYS AROSE OUT OF THE CONDITION OF THE TIME SIMILARLY
WAS A BRIDGE ALL READY FOR HIM MADE OF LIVING MONKEYS FOR WHILE HIS BACK WAS TURNED THE MONKEYS QUICK AS A FLASH HAD MADE THEMSELVES INTO A BRIDGE
ON THESE FEW STEPS OF HIS DANGEROUS WAY CHARLES DARNAY HAD SET HIS FOOT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR MANETTE'S REITERATED INSTRUCTIONS THE SAME CAUTIOUS COUNSEL DIRECTED EVERY STEP THAT LAY BEFORE HIM
AND HAD PREPARED EVERY INCH OF HIS ROAD THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHY HAD HE RETURNED TO FRANCE WHEN HE DID AND NOT SOONER HE HAD NOT RETURNED SOONER HE REPLIED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS OF LIVING IN FRANCE SAVE THOSE HE HAD RESIGNED
HE CALLED EVERYBODY A FOOL HE THREW HIS TOOTH BRUSH AT THE PALACE CAT HE RUSHED ROUND IN HIS NIGHT SHIRT AND WOKE UP ALL HIS ARMY AND SENT THEM INTO THE JUNGLE TO CATCH THE DOCTOR
OF THE DAYS WHEN MEN DRESSED IN BEAR SKINS AND LIVED IN HOLES IN THE ROCK AND ATE THEIR MUTTON RAW BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT COOKING WAS HAVING NEVER SEEN A FIRE
WITH HIS SHORT LEGS SOON GOT TIRED AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO CARRY HIM WHICH MADE IT PRETTY HARD WHEN THEY HAD THE TRUNK AND THE HAND BAG WITH THEM AS WELL THE KING OF THE JOLLIGINKI
BY THE SURRENDER OF THE CITIZEN EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY DOCTOR MANETTE WAS NEXT QUESTIONED HIS HIGH PERSONAL POPULARITY AND THE CLEARNESS OF HIS ANSWERS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION
MY BROTHER DOES KNOW IT WAS HENRY'S ANSWER DOES HE THEN WHY DOES HE STAY HERE HE MADE NO REPLY AND WAS BEGINNING TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT SHE EAGERLY CONTINUED
AND A LITTLE CONCERT FOR THAT EVENING THEY CROWDED TO THE GRATES AND SHED TEARS THERE BUT TWENTY PLACES IN THE PROJECTED ENTERTAINMENTS HAD TO BE REFILLED AND THE TIME WAS AT BEST SHORT TO THE LOCK UP HOUR
WHEN CATHERINE KNEW THIS HER RESOLUTION WAS DIRECTLY MADE SHE SPOKE TO HENRY TILNEY ON THE SUBJECT REGRETTING HIS BROTHER'S EVIDENT PARTIALITY FOR MISS THORPE AND ENTREATING HIM TO MAKE KNOWN HER PRIOR ENGAGEMENT
WHO WORE THEIR USUAL CLOTHES AND HAD NOT ASSUMED THE COARSE GARB
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND DETERMINED JURY SAT EVERY DAY THEIR LISTS WENT FORTH EVERY EVENING
WELL NAY IF IT IS TO BE GUESSWORK LET US ALL GUESS FOR OURSELVES TO BE GUIDED BY SECOND HAND CONJECTURE IS PITIFUL THE PREMISES ARE BEFORE YOU
ISABELLA IS WRONG BUT I AM SURE SHE CANNOT MEAN TO TORMENT FOR SHE IS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER SHE HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM EVER SINCE THEY FIRST MET AND WHILE MY FATHER'S CONSENT WAS UNCERTAIN SHE FRETTED HERSELF ALMOST INTO A FEVER
CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY HAD REASON TO KNOW THE USAGE HE HAD SEEN HUNDREDS PASS AWAY SO
THE NIGHT IN ITS VERMIN HAUNTED CELLS WAS LONG AND COLD NEXT DAY FIFTEEN PRISONERS WERE PUT TO THE BAR BEFORE CHARLES DARNAY'S NAME WAS CALLED ALL THE FIFTEEN WERE CONDEMNED
IN WHICH THERE SEEMED TO BE EVERY FACE HE HAD SEEN IN COURT EXCEPT TWO FOR WHICH HE LOOKED IN VAIN ON HIS COMING OUT THE CONCOURSE MADE AT HIM ANEW WEEPING EMBRACING AND SHOUTING ALL BY TURNS AND ALL TOGETHER
TO LIVE BY HIS OWN INDUSTRY IN ENGLAND RATHER THAN ON THE INDUSTRY OF THE OVERLADEN PEOPLE OF FRANCE WHAT PROOF HAD HE OF THIS HE HANDED IN THE NAMES OF TWO WITNESSES THEOPHILE GABELLE AND ALEXANDRE MANETTE
THE SEVENTH CHAPTER
UNTIL THE VERY TIDE OF THE RIVER ON THE BANK OF WHICH THE MAD SCENE WAS ACTED SEEMED TO RUN MAD LIKE THE PEOPLE ON THE SHORE THEY PUT HIM INTO A GREAT CHAIR THEY HAD AMONG THEM
AND THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE ACROSS THE RIVER AND JIP THE DOG LOOKED DOWN OVER THE EDGE OF THE STEEP STEEP CLIFF AND SAID GOLLY HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET ACROSS
OH DEAR SAID GUB GUB THE KING'S MEN ARE QUITE CLOSE NOW LOOK AT THEM I AM AFRAID WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN BACK TO PRISON AGAIN AND HE BEGAN TO WEEP
THEN BEGAN ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WITH WHICH THE POPULACE SOMETIMES GRATIFIED THEIR FICKLENESS OR THEIR BETTER IMPULSES TOWARDS GENEROSITY AND MERCY
AND TWO HAD ALREADY BEEN GUILLOTINED AND FORGOTTEN THE LIST WAS READ IN THE VAULTED CHAMBER WHERE DARNAY HAD SEEN THE ASSOCIATED PRISONERS ON THE NIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL EVERY ONE OF THOSE HAD PERISHED IN THE MASSACRE
AND WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD UPON HIS FEET SHE DROPPED INSENSIBLE IN HIS ARMS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS HEART AND TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD BETWEEN HIS FACE AND THE BRAWLING CROWD
WHICH WAS PROMPTLY ACCEPTED THE CANADIAN GOT INTO HIS UNDERWATER COSTUME AND WAS READY AS SOON AS HIS FELLOW WORKERS
BOILING HOT AT THE BODY OF THE PUMP THE STEAMING WATER WAS INJECTED INTO THE ICY WATER OUTSIDE AND AFTER THREE HOURS HAD PASSED
SHADOWS ILLUSIONS MELTING AND EVAPORATING OUTSIDE THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT WHEN THE LAST TIPS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS HAD DISAPPEARED BELOW THE HORIZON
BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY FIVE METERS AND WENT ALONG THE SOUTH AMERICAN COAST
NEXT TO ME MY TWO COMPANIONS WERE GETTING TIPSY ON THE FRESH OXYGEN PARTICLES POOR SOULS WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM LONG STARVATION MUSTN'T POUNCE HEEDLESSLY ON THE FIRST FOOD GIVEN THEM WE ON THE OTHER HAND DIDN'T HAVE TO PRACTICE SUCH MODERATION
IT SERVED AS BOTH NEST AND NOURISHMENT FOR MYRIADS OF CRUSTACEANS AND MOLLUSKS FOR CRABS AND CUTTLEFISH HERE SEALS AND OTTERS COULD INDULGE IN A SUMPTUOUS MEAL MIXING MEAT FROM FISH
WE'LL NEVER REGRET HAVING KNOWN HIM ESPECIALLY ONCE WE'VE LEFT HIM NED LAND SHOT BACK THE NEXT DAY
IN THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP FINE SAMPLES OF ALGAE IN PARTICULAR CERTAIN FUCUS PLANTS WHOSE ROOTS WERE LADEN WITH THE WORLD'S BEST MUSSELS
THEN HIS MEN SIMULTANEOUSLY STAKED IT OFF AT SEVERAL POINTS AROUND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE SOON THEIR PICKS WERE VIGOROUSLY ATTACKING THIS COMPACT MATTER AND HUGE CHUNKS WERE LOOSENED FROM ITS MASS
YAWNS DISLOCATED MY JAWS MY LUNGS WERE GASPING IN THEIR QUEST FOR THAT ENKINDLING ELASTIC FLUID REQUIRED FOR BREATHING NOW GROWING SCARCER AND SCARCER MY MIND WAS IN A DAZE I LAY OUTSTRETCHED STRENGTH GONE
THAT AN INVOLUNTARY TERROR SWEEPS OVER ME AND MY LUNGS STILL SEEM SHORT OF AIR MEANWHILE
AND SHAKE THEM CONTINUALLY BUT THIS SUBSTANCE WAS MISSING ON BOARD AND NOTHING ELSE COULD REPLACE IT
BUT THEY'LL SUPPLY AIR FOR ONLY TWO DAYS NOW THEN WE'VE BEEN BURIED BENEATH THE WATERS FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS AND THE NAUTILUS'S HEAVY ATMOSPHERE ALREADY NEEDS RENEWING IN ANOTHER FORTY EIGHT HOURS OUR RESERVE AIR WILL BE USED UP
IF ONLY MY NAUTILUS WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO STAND THAT MUCH PRESSURE WITHOUT BEING CRUSHED WELL I ASKED NOT CATCHING THE CAPTAIN'S MEANING DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND HE WENT ON THAT THE CONGEALING OF THIS WATER
WE COULD SUCK THE ATOMS FROM THE AIR BY THE LUNGFUL AND IT WAS THE BREEZE THE BREEZE ITSELF THAT POURED INTO US THIS LUXURIOUS INTOXICATION AHHH CONSEIL WAS PUTTING IN
AND WHAT POWERFUL INHALATIONS THE CANADIAN DREW LIKE A FURNACE GOING FULL BLAST OUR STRENGTH RETURNED PROMPTLY AND WHEN I LOOKED AROUND I SAW THAT WE WERE ALONE ON THE PLATFORM NO CREWMEN
A PYRAMID SHAPED BLOCK OF SHALE WITH A VERY SHARP SUMMIT WHICH DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT'S CLEAR OR VEILED IN VAPOR PREDICTS FAIR WEATHER OR FOUL AS NED LAND TOLD ME A FIRST CLASS BAROMETER MY FRIEND
THE LAND OF FIRE A NAME GIVEN IT BY EARLY NAVIGATORS AFTER THEY SAW NUMEROUS CURLS OF SMOKE RISING FROM THE NATIVES HUTS THIS LAND OF FIRE FORMS A HUGE CLUSTER OF ISLANDS OVER THIRTY LEAGUES LONG AND EIGHTY LEAGUES WIDE
WE LISTENED WE FORGOT OUR SUFFERINGS WE HOPED ONCE MORE WE HAD STAKED OUR SALVATION ON THIS ONE LAST GAMBLE DESPITE THE BUZZING IN MY HEAD I SOON COULD HEAR VIBRATIONS UNDER THE NAUTILUS'S HULL WE TILTED
I SQUEEZED IT IN AN INVOLUNTARY CONVULSION ALL AT ONCE CARRIED AWAY BY ITS FRIGHTFUL EXCESS LOAD THE NAUTILUS SANK INTO THE WATERS LIKE A CANNONBALL IN OTHER WORDS DROPPING AS IF IN A VACUUM
WORKING HIMSELF CAPTAIN NEMO PASSED NEAR ME JUST THEN I TOUCHED HIM WITH MY HAND AND POINTED TO THE WALLS OF OUR PRISON THE STARBOARD WALL HAD MOVED FORWARD TO A POINT LESS THAN FOUR METERS FROM THE NAUTILUS'S HULL
HAD HE PERISHED HAD HIS COMPANIONS DIED WITH HIM
THAT WAS ONE DEGREE GAINED
IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY IN A MANNER OF CONFOUNDED BY THIS LAPSE INTO BANALITY CONSEIL LEFT HIS SENTENCE HANGING MY FRIENDS I REPLIED VERY MOVED
THE INJECTIONS COULDN'T GET IT TO GO A SINGLE DEGREE HIGHER
THAT'S GOOD NEWS THE CANADIAN REPLIED BUT WHERE'S THE NAUTILUS GOING I'M UNABLE TO SAY NED AFTER THE SOUTH POLE
THERE WE WERE SEPARATED FROM THE SEA BY A TEN METER BARRIER THAT'S HOW THICK THE ICEBERG WAS FROM THIS POINT ON IT WAS AN ISSUE OF CUTTING OUT A PIECE EQUAL IN SURFACE AREA TO THE NAUTILUS'S WATERLINE THIS MEANT DETACHING ABOUT
BULB BEARING SEAWEED OF WHICH THE OPEN SEA AT THE POLE HAD REVEALED A FEW SPECIMENS WITH THEIR SMOOTH VISCOUS FILAMENTS THEY MEASURED AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED METERS LONG GENUINE CABLES MORE THAN AN INCH THICK AND VERY TOUGH
IT WAS NOW THE TWENTY SIXTH WE HAD LIVED OFF THE SHIP'S STORES FOR FIVE DAYS AND ALL REMAINING BREATHABLE AIR HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN EVEN TODAY AS I WRITE THESE LINES MY SENSATIONS ARE SO INTENSE
KEEPING TO ITS NORTHERLY HEADING IT FOLLOWED THE LONG WINDINGS OF SOUTH AMERICA BY THEN WE HAD FARED SIXTEEN THOUSAND LEAGUES SINCE COMING ON BOARD IN THE SEAS OF JAPAN
AND YOU MY GALLANT CONSEIL YOU SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL NOT TOO MUCH TO BE CANDID WITH MASTER I WAS LACKING A FEW THROATFULS OF AIR BUT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BY
THE ICE CRACKED WITH AN ODD RIPPING SOUND LIKE PAPER TEARING AND THE NAUTILUS BEGAN SETTLING DOWNWARD WE'RE GOING THROUGH CONSEIL MUTTERED IN MY EAR I COULDN'T ANSWER HIM I CLUTCHED HIS HAND
IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GREAT BROWN CLUB OR WALKING STICK AND STRIKING THIS UPON THE FLOOR IT FELL ASUNDER AND BECAME A CHAIR ON WHICH HE SAT DOWN QUITE COMPOSEDLY THERE SAID THE CARRIER TURNING TO HIS WIFE
CLIPPED WORDS FORMLESS SENTENCES POTTED EXPRESSIONS OF APPROVAL OR DISGUST MONTH BY MONTH THINGS WERE STEPPING LIVELIER BUT TO WHAT GOAL THE POPULATION STILL ROSE BUT WHAT WAS THE QUALITY OF THE MEN BORN
GOOD EVENING TILLY GOOD EVENING UNBEKNOWN HOW'S BABY MUM BOXER'S PRETTY WELL I HOPE ALL THRIVING CALEB REPLIED DOT
I DECLARE I'VE CLEAN FORGOTTEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE CART SAID JOHN HE WAS ASLEEP AMONG THE STRAW THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM I'VE
WAS SHE PRETTY HER FIGURE MAY HAVE BEEN GOOD ONCE THE FLATS THEIR ONLY OUTLOOK HUNG LIKE AN ORNATE CURTAIN BETWEEN MARGARET AND THE WELTER OF LONDON HER THOUGHTS TURNED SADLY TO HOUSE HUNTING
THREE MONTHS MIGHT HAVE DONE IT IN GENERAL BUT REGINALD'S FEELINGS WERE NO LESS LASTING THAN LIVELY WHETHER LADY SUSAN WAS OR WAS NOT HAPPY IN HER SECOND CHOICE I DO NOT SEE HOW IT CAN EVER BE ASCERTAINED
THAT SHE CERTAINLY DID NOT FEEL SHE HAD KEPT HOUSE FOR OVER TEN YEARS SHE HAD ENTERTAINED ALMOST WITH DISTINCTION SHE HAD BROUGHT UP A CHARMING SISTER AND WAS BRINGING UP A BROTHER SURELY IF EXPERIENCE IS ATTAINABLE SHE HAD ATTAINED IT
WHAT IT IS HE SNEERED WHAT IT IS WORSE LUCK I WANT ACTIVITY WITHOUT CIVILIZATION HOW PARADOXICAL YET I EXPECT THAT IS WHAT WE SHALL FIND IN HEAVEN AND I SAID TIBBY
AS WELL AS SHE HAD DONE AT CHURCHHILL AS SHE MUST CONFESS HERSELF TO HAVE SOMETIMES AN ANXIOUS DOUBT OF LONDON'S PERFECTLY AGREEING WITH HER MISSUS VERNON ENCOURAGING THE DOUBT DIRECTLY PROPOSED HER NIECE'S RETURNING WITH THEM INTO THE COUNTRY
THE CARRIER PUT HIS HAND INTO A POCKET OF THE COAT HE HAD TAKEN OFF AND BROUGHT OUT CAREFULLY PRESERVED IN MOSS AND PAPER A TINY FLOWER POT THERE IT IS HE SAID ADJUSTING IT WITH GREAT CARE
WORK WORK WORK IF YOU'D SAVE YOUR SOUL AND YOUR BODY IT IS HONESTLY A NECESSITY DEAR BOY LOOK AT THE WILCOXES LOOK AT MISTER PEMBROKE WITH ALL THEIR DEFECTS OF TEMPER AND UNDERSTANDING
SHE WAS NOT INTELLECTUAL NOR EVEN ALERT AND IT WAS ODD THAT ALL THE SAME SHE SHOULD GIVE THE IDEA OF GREATNESS MARGARET ZIGZAGGING WITH HER FRIENDS OVER THOUGHT AND ART WAS CONSCIOUS OF A PERSONALITY THAT TRANSCENDED THEIR OWN
VERY LITTLE ASSISTANCE TO THE STATE COULD BE DERIVED FROM THE EPISTOLARY INTERCOURSE OF MISSUS VERNON AND HER NIECE
OH YES OR ILFRACOMBE AND SWANAGE AND TUNBRIDGE WELLS AND SURBITON AND BEDFORD THERE ON NO ACCOUNT LONDON THEN
AND A CHILL FELL ON THE CONVERSATION OH MISSUS WILCOX SAY SOMETHING NICER THAN THAT IT'S SUCH A SNUB TO BE TOLD YOU PUT THINGS SPLENDIDLY I DO NOT MEAN IT AS A SNUB
SHE HAD A FACE LIKE A SILKWORM AND THE DINING ROOM REEKS OF ORRIS ROOT WE CHATTED PLEASANTLY A LITTLE ABOUT HUSBANDS AND I WONDERED WHERE HERS WAS TOO AND ADVISED HER TO GO TO THE POLICE SHE THANKED ME
I HAVE LONG WANTED TO HEAR WHAT IS SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE THE OTHER SIDE THEN YOU DO DISAGREE OH GOOD GIVE US YOUR SIDE I HAVE NO SIDE BUT MY HUSBAND HER VOICE SOFTENED THE CHILL INCREASED
WANT CIVILIZATION WITHOUT ACTIVITY WHICH I EXPECT IS WHAT WE SHALL FIND IN THE OTHER PLACE
CONCLUDED BY DECLINING ENTIRELY TO PROFIT BY SUCH UNEXAMPLED ATTENTION MISSUS VERNON PERSEVERED HOWEVER IN THE OFFER OF IT AND THOUGH LADY SUSAN CONTINUED TO RESIST HER RESISTANCE IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS SEEMED
OR OFTEN HAVING LEARNT ENOUGH IN THE MEANWHILE FROM HER OPEN HEARTED BROTHER OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND LADY SUSAN TO SINK THE LATTER LOWER THAN EVER IN HER OPINION
I AM NOT SURE THAT I AGREE DO YOU SAID HE TURNING TO MISSUS WILCOX SHE REPLIED I THINK MISS SCHLEGEL PUTS EVERYTHING SPLENDIDLY
NO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR NINNIES THEN THEY WERE MEN WHO HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO SAID HIS SISTER FEELING THAT SHE WAS ENTITLED TO SCORE THIS POINT SO TAKE WARNING YOU MUST WORK OR ELSE YOU MUST PRETEND TO WORK WHICH IS WHAT I DO
AND NOT TILL THE MEAL WAS HALF OVER DID THEY REALIZE THAT THE PRINCIPAL GUEST HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE CHASE THERE WAS NO COMMON TOPIC MISSUS WILCOX WHOSE LIFE HAD BEEN SPENT IN THE SERVICE OF HUSBAND AND SONS
NOT TO BE MARRIED WAS A HUNDRED YEARS AGO I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE OF THIS PROFOUND DESIRE TO WHICH YOU ALLUDE ENUNCIATED TIBBY
IT'S A BOX OF DOLLS EYES FOR MY DAUGHTERS WORK
I KNOW WHAT I KNOW SHE KEPT REPEATING NOT UNCIVILLY BUT WITH EXTREME GLOOM
FLATTERED AND FINESSED INTO AN AFFECTION FOR HER WHICH ALLOWING LEISURE FOR THE CONQUEST OF HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER MOTHER FOR HIS ABJURING ALL FUTURE ATTACHMENTS AND DETESTING THE SEX MIGHT BE REASONABLY LOOKED FOR IN THE COURSE OF A TWELVEMONTH
THEN THERE'S GUY THAT WAS A PITIFUL BUSINESS BESIDES SHIFTING TO THE GENERAL EVERY ONE IS THE BETTER FOR SOME REGULAR WORK GROANS I SHALL STICK TO IT SHE CONTINUED SMILING
SUCH MEN GIVE ME MORE PLEASURE THAN MANY WHO ARE BETTER EQUIPPED AND I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE WORKED REGULARLY AND HONESTLY SPARE ME THE WILCOXES HE MOANED
WHAT I THINK THE TRUTH YOU SEE
DID HE AT ALL KNOW WHERE HE WANTED TO LIVE TIBBY DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE DID KNOW DID HE AT ALL KNOW WHAT HE WANTED TO DO HE WAS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN BUT WHEN PRESSED REMARKED THAT HE SHOULD PREFER TO BE QUITE FREE OF ANY PROFESSION
SHE BANGED THINGS ABOUT AND RATTLED THE STOVE COVERS UNTIL EVEN CECILY PROTESTED FROM HER SOFA DAN SAT ON THE FLOOR AND WHITTLED
BUT AT FELICITY'S PROHIBITION THE REBELLION WHICH HAD SMOULDERED IN HIM ALL DAY BROKE INTO SUDDEN FLAME HE WOULD SHOW HER I'LL EAT THEM IF I PLEASE FELICITY KING HE SAID IN A FURY I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE POISON LOOK HERE
THE YOUNG MINISTER TURNED PALE AS THE DEAD
THEY MADE VERY LONG PRAYERS IN THOSE DAYS YOU KNOW AND AT THE END OF HIS PRAYER HE SAID
IF I LEAN BACK THE LEAST BIT AND I'M GOING TO WORK BUTTONHOLES ALL OVER THIS COTTON I HATE WORKING BUTTONHOLES WORSE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD SO I'M GOING TO WORK THEM ALL DAY WHAT'S THE GOOD OF WORKING BUTTONHOLES ON AN OLD RAG ASKED FELICITY IT ISN'T ANY GOOD
CAROUSING WITHOUT STINT ON RAISIN PIES AND UNCLE EDWARD'S CHERRIES BUT SHE WORKED ON AT HER BUTTONHOLES SHE WOULD NOT LOOK AT THE EXCITING SERIAL IN THE NEW MAGAZINE DAN BROUGHT HOME FROM THE POST OFFICE NEITHER WOULD SHE OPEN A LETTER FROM HER FATHER
WHEN YOUR FATHER'S RUN AWAY AND YOUR MOTHER GOES OUT WASHING AND YOU'RE ONLY OLD ENOUGH TO GET FIFTY CENTS A WEEK YOU CAN'T GIVE MUCH TO THE HEATHEN BUT I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN MY AUNT JANE WAS FOND OF MISSIONS
TO SIT DOWN TO ONE OF AUNT JANET'S MEALS IN ORDINARY HEALTH AND APPETITE AND EAT NOTHING BUT BREAD AND WATER THAT WOULD BE PENANCE WITH A VENGEANCE WE FELT WE COULD NEVER DO IT BUT THE STORY GIRL DID IT WE ADMIRED AND PITIED HER
ALL THE DEFIANCE AND BRAVADO GONE OUT OF HIM WE ALL WENT TO PIECES EXCEPT CECILY WHO ALONE RETAINED HER PRESENCE OF MIND HAVE YOU GOT A PAIN IN YOUR STOMACH SHE DEMANDED I'VE GOT AN AWFUL PAIN HERE
MISSUS RAY SAYS IF SHE ISN'T BETTER BY THE MORNING
NOBODY EVER KNEW THEY SUPPOSED HE HAD SEEN HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW BEFORE HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE
TOLD HER SHE WAS A LITTLE BRICK AND HAD DONE JUST THE RIGHT THING EXAMINED SOME OF THE FATAL BERRIES AND GAVE IT AS HIS OPINION THAT THEY WERE PROBABLY POISONOUS ADMINISTERED SOME POWDERS TO DAN
BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE UP FOR IT TO MORROW SAID THE STORY GIRL ENERGETICALLY IN FACT I'LL BEGIN TO NIGHT I'M GOING TO THE PANTRY AS SOON AS I GET HOME AND I'LL READ FATHER'S LETTER BEFORE I GO TO BED WASN'T THE MISSIONARY SPLENDID THAT CANNIBAL STORY WAS SIMPLY GRAND
WILLIAM IS A MAN'S NAME AND MEN ARE NEVER SWEET
DEMANDED THE STORY GIRL AGGRIEVED I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING RETORTED AUNT JANET
IT JUST MEANS QUEER SAID CECILY NUDGING HIM WITH HER ELBOW A COMMON MAN WOULD BE QUEER BUT WHEN IT'S A MINISTER IT'S ECCENTRIC WHEN HE GETS VERY OLD CONTINUED THE STORY GIRL THE PRESBYTERY THOUGHT IT WAS TIME HE WAS RETIRED
PAT CAME OVER BUT HIS MOST SEDUCTIVE PURRS WON NO NOTICE FROM HIS MISTRESS WHO REFUSED HERSELF THE PLEASURE OF EVEN PATTING HIM AUNT JANET COULD NOT GO DOWN THE HILL IN THE AFTERNOON TO FIND OUT HOW SARA WAS BECAUSE COMPANY CAME TO TEA
DETERMINED TO START ONE I DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO FEEL AS INT'RESTED IN MISSIONARIES AS YOU FOLKS DO HE SAID BUT MAYBE IF I BEGIN TO GIVE SOMETHING I'LL GET INT'RESTED I'LL WANT TO KNOW HOW MY MONEY'S BEING SPENT I WON'T BE ABLE TO GIVE MUCH
WITHOUT YOUR DOING ANYTHING SAID CECILY WELL MY CONSCIENCE WILL FEEL BETTER I DON'T BELIEVE PRESBYTERIANS EVER DO PENANCE SAID FELICITY DUBIOUSLY I NEVER HEARD OF ONE DOING IT BUT THE REST OF US RATHER LOOKED WITH FAVOUR ON THE STORY GIRL'S IDEA
A WISHING FAIRY MIGHT HAVE HAD THE TIME OF HER LIFE IN THE KING KITCHEN THAT MORNING PARTICULARLY IF SHE WERE A CYNICALLY INCLINED FAIRY
BUT THEY ARE NOT SWEET AND SHOULDN'T BE THAT IS FOR WOMEN OH LOOK AT THE MOONSHINE ON THE ROAD IN THAT GAP BETWEEN THE SPRUCES I'D LIKE A DRESS OF MOONSHINE WITH STARS FOR BUTTONS IT WOULDN'T DO SAID FELICITY DECIDEDLY YOU COULD SEE THROUGH IT
AND I MUSTN'T DO THAT I SHA'N'T SLEEP A WINK TO NIGHT I DON'T THINK SHE DID SHE LOOKED VERY PALE AND WOEBEGONE WHEN SHE CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST BUT FOR ALL THAT THERE WAS A CERTAIN EXHILARATION ABOUT HER
NOW YOU SEE ALL YOUR PENANCE WAS WASTED SAID FELICITY AS WE WALKED HOME KEEPING CLOSE TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE RUMOUR THAT PEG BOWEN WAS ABROAD OH I DON'T KNOW I FEEL BETTER SINCE I PUNISHED MYSELF
I WANT TO MORTIFY THE FLESH I'LL MORTIFY YOU IF I CATCH YOU SHOWING YOURSELF TO THE MILLWARDS LIKE THAT MY GIRL GO RIGHT HOME AND DRESS YOURSELF DECENTLY OR EAT YOUR SUPPER IN THE KITCHEN THE STORY GIRL CHOSE THE LATTER ALTERNATIVE
SHE SAYS NONE OF US MUST GO NEAR THE PLACE TILL WE KNOW WHETHER IT IS THE MEASLES OR NOT I'VE THOUGHT OF A GREAT PENANCE SAID CECILY EAGERLY DON'T GO TO THE MISSIONARY MEETING TO NIGHT THE STORY GIRL LOOKED PITEOUS
SHE MADE HIM SWALLOW EVERY AVAILABLE ANTIDOTE WHICH WAS RECOMMENDED IN THE DOCTOR'S BOOK AND SHE APPLIED HOT CLOTHS TO HIM UNTIL HER FAITHFUL LITTLE HANDS WERE HALF SCALDED OFF THERE WAS NO DOUBT DAN WAS SUFFERING INTENSE PAIN
YOU CAN GIVE IT TO THE METHODIST MINISTER AT MARKDALE I GUESS THE PRESBYTERIANS CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT IT AND LOOK AFTER THEIR OWN HEATHEN JUST SMELL MISSUS SAMPSON'S FLOWERS SAID CECILY AS WE PASSED A TRIM WHITE PALING CLOSE TO THE ROAD
I NOTICED THAT DAN WAS RATHER PALE AND QUIET HE LAY DOWN ON THE KITCHEN SOFA
MISTER SCOTT PLANTED THE YELLOW PLUM TREE IN GRANDFATHER'S TIME SAID CECILY PEELING ONE OF THE PLUMS AND WHEN HE DID IT HE SAID IT WAS AS CHRISTIAN AN ACT AS HE EVER DID I WONDER WHAT HE MEANT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING VERY CHRISTIAN ABOUT PLANTING A TREE
FOR A SIN I COMMITTED I CAN'T CONFESS IT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BRING TROUBLE ON ANOTHER PERSON SO I'M GOING TO DO PENANCE ALL DAY YOU DON'T MIND DO YOU AUNT JANET WAS IN A VERY GOOD HUMOUR THAT MORNING SO SHE MERELY LAUGHED
AND ATE EARLY AUGUST APPLES TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE STORY GIRL SAID WE MADE HER THINK OF THE IRISHMAN'S PIG AN IRISHMAN WHO LIVED AT MARKDALE HAD A LITTLE PIG SHE SAID AND HE GAVE IT A PAILFUL OF MUSH
AND EATING ONLY BREAD AND WATER BEFORE THE CRITICAL MILLWARDS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSITIVE BLISS TO HER WHEN WE WENT TO THE MISSIONARY MEETING THAT EVENING
ABOUT HIS LOSSES MAYBE
WAS UNABLE TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE OF SUCH A VIOLENT ROAR THAT THE ABUSED MISTER CHITLING WITHOUT ANY PRELIMINARY CEREMONIES RUSHED ACROSS THE ROOM AND AIMED A BLOW AT THE OFFENDER WHO BEING SKILFUL IN EVADING PURSUIT DUCKED TO AVOID IT AND CHOSE HIS TIME SO WELL
BUT BETWEEN BOTH I EXPRESSED IN REPEATED CONVERSATIONS A STRONG DESIRE OF SEEING THE WORLD FROM WHICH I WAS DISCOURAGED BY MY PARENTS THOUGH MY FATHER HAD BEEN NO INCONSIDERABLE TRAVELLER HIMSELF
ALL OF WHICH REMONSTRANCES MASTER BATES RECEIVED IN EXTREMELY GOOD PART MERELY REQUESTING HIS FRIEND TO BE BLOWED OR TO INSERT HIS HEAD IN A SACK OR REPLYING WITH SOME OTHER NEATLY TURNED WITTICISM OF A SIMILAR KIND THE HAPPY APPLICATION OF WHICH
IT BLOWS MA'AM REPLIED MISTER BUMBLE TURNING UP HIS COAT COLLAR ENOUGH TO CUT ONE'S EARS OFF THE MATRON LOOKED FROM THE LITTLE KETTLE TO THE BEADLE WHO WAS MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR AND AS THE BEADLE COUGHED PREPARATORY TO BIDDING HER GOOD NIGHT BASHFULLY INQUIRED WHETHER
TOBY CONTINUED TO EAT WITH THE UTMOST OUTWARD INDIFFERENCE UNTIL HE COULD EAT NO MORE THEN
PROCEEDED TO MAKE THE TEA HOW SLIGHT A THING WILL DISTURB THE EQUANIMITY OF OUR FRAIL MINDS THE BLACK TEAPOT BEING VERY SMALL AND EASILY FILLED RAN OVER WHILE MISSUS CORNEY WAS MORALISING AND THE WATER SLIGHTLY SCALDED MISSUS CORNEY'S HAND DRAT THE POT
IF YOU PLEASE MISTRESS SAID A WITHERED OLD FEMALE PAUPER HIDEOUSLY UGLY
EXCITED CONSIDERABLE ADMIRATION IN THE MIND OF MISTER CHITLING IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT THE LATTER GENTLEMAN AND HIS PARTNER INVARIABLY LOST AND THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE SO FAR FROM ANGERING MASTER BATES
APPEARED TO AFFORD HIM THE HIGHEST AMUSEMENT INASMUCH AS HE LAUGHED MOST UPROARIOUSLY AT THE END OF EVERY DEAL AND PROTESTED THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A JOLLY GAME IN ALL HIS BORN DAYS
ABOUT I FOUND A LARGE CROCODILE WITH HIS MOUTH EXTENDED ALMOST READY TO RECEIVE ME ON MY RIGHT HAND WAS THE PIECE OF WATER BEFORE MENTIONED AND ON MY LEFT A DEEP PRECIPICE SAID TO HAVE
YOU HAVE A CAT MA'AM I SEE SAID MISTER BUMBLE GLANCING AT ONE WHO IN THE CENTRE OF HER FAMILY WAS BASKING BEFORE THE FIRE AND KITTENS TOO I DECLARE I AM SO FOND OF THEM MISTER BUMBLE YOU CAN'T THINK REPLIED THE MATRON
PACING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM MEANWHILE IN IRREPRESSIBLE EXCITEMENT
AT FIRST THE JEW CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH PATIENTLY WATCHING HIS COUNTENANCE AS IF TO GAIN FROM ITS EXPRESSION SOME CLUE TO THE INTELLIGENCE HE BROUGHT BUT IN VAIN
BLEAK DARK AND PIERCING COLD IT WAS A NIGHT FOR THE WELL HOUSED AND FED TO DRAW ROUND THE BRIGHT FIRE AND THANK GOD THEY WERE AT HOME AND FOR THE HOMELESS STARVING WRETCH TO LAY HIM DOWN AND DIE
SO LIKE MISTER GRANNETT WASN'T IT INTERPOSED THE MATRON WELL MISTER BUMBLE WELL MA'AM REJOINED THE BEADLE HE WENT AWAY AND HE DID DIE IN THE STREETS THERE'S A OBSTINATE PAUPER FOR YOU
IT WAS A ROUND TABLE AND AS MISSUS CORNEY AND MISTER BUMBLE HAD BEEN SITTING OPPOSITE EACH OTHER WITH NO GREAT SPACE BETWEEN THEM AND FRONTING THE FIRE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT MISTER BUMBLE
MISTER DAWKINS RECEIVED THESE HANDSOME COMPLIMENTS WITH MUCH PHILOSOPHY AND OFFERED TO CUT ANY GENTLEMAN IN COMPANY FOR THE FIRST PICTURE CARD AT A SHILLING AT A TIME NOBODY ACCEPTING THE CHALLENGE AND HIS PIPE BEING BY THIS TIME SMOKED OUT
THAT THE BOARD ORDERED FOR THE INFIRMARY REAL FRESH GENUINE PORT WINE

WE STOPPED TO TAKE HIM BETWEEN US HIS HEAD HUNG DOWN AND HE WAS COLD THEY WERE CLOSE UPON OUR HEELS EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF AND EACH FROM THE GALLOWS
ANGRILY PURSUED THE POOR HALF WITTED DUPE

THANK'EE SAID SCROOGE I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU I THANK YOU FIFTY TIMES BLESS YOU HE WENT TO CHURCH AND WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS AND WATCHED THE PEOPLE HURRYING TO AND FRO AND PATTED CHILDREN ON THE HEAD AND QUESTIONED BEGGARS
OF COURSE NOT WHEN WOULD THEY BE MISTER BUMBLE SAID THE MATRON SIPPING HER TEA WHEN INDEED MA'AM REJOINED MISTER BUMBLE
HE WAS A STRONG ATHLETIC MAN AND BEING USED TO THAT CLIMATE FOR HE HAD RESIDED THERE SOME YEARS HE BORE THE VIOLENT HEAT OF THE SUN MUCH BETTER THAN I COULD IN OUR EXCURSION HE HAD MADE A CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS THROUGH A THICK WOOD WHEN I WAS ONLY AT THE ENTRANCE
MINISTERS OF STATE LORD MAYORS AND OTHER GREAT PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES BUT MORE PARTICULARLY BENEATH THE STATELINESS AND GRAVITY OF A BEADLE WHO AS IS WELL KNOWN SHOULD BE THE STERNEST AND MOST INFLEXIBLE AMONG THEM ALL

THE BRAVEST SOLDIERS BRAVE BRAVE WERE THE SOLDIERS HIGH NAMED TO DAY WHO LIVED THROUGH THE FIGHT BUT THE BRAVEST PRESS'D TO THE FRONT AND FELL UNNAMED UNKNOWN
WHEN OATES AFTER HIS SCOURGING WAS CARRIED INTO NEWGATE INSENSIBLE AND AS ALL THOUGHT IN THE LAST AGONY HE HAD BEEN BLED AND HIS WOUNDS HAD BEEN DRESSED BY BATEMAN THIS WAS AN OFFENCE
THERE WAS SCARCELY ONE EMINENT PEER ATTACHED TO THE OLD FAITH WHOSE HONOUR WHOSE ESTATE WHOSE LIFE HAD NOT BEEN IN JEOPARDY WHO HAD NOT PASSED MONTHS IN THE TOWER
PROTECTED BY ENTAIL AGAINST FORFEITURE IN THE CASE OF GREY AND OF MEN SITUATED LIKE HIM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GRATIFY CRUELTY AND RAPACITY AT ONCE BUT A RICH TRADER MIGHT BE BOTH HANGED AND PLUNDERED
AND HIS ZEAL FOR THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION HAD GROWN UP TOGETHER AND HAD STRENGTHENED EACH OTHER IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE TWO SENTIMENTS WHICH SEEMED INSEPARABLE AND EVEN IDENTICAL
DISTRACTED BETWEEN TWO DUTIES EQUALLY SACRED BETWEEN TWO AFFECTIONS EQUALLY ARDENT HOW WAS HE TO GIVE TO CAESAR ALL THAT WAS CAESAR'S AND YET TO WITHHOLD FROM GOD NO PART OF WHAT WAS GOD'S
HAD A LARGE CHARITY HER LIFE WAS PASSED IN RELIEVING THE UNHAPPY OF ALL RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS AND SHE WAS WELL KNOWN
SUCH WERE THE SENTIMENTS OF THE KING'S TWO KINSMEN THE EARLS OF CLARENDON AND ROCHESTER THE POWER AND FAVOUR OF THESE NOBLEMEN SEEMED TO BE GREAT INDEED
THOSE WHICH DESCEND FROM THE BROW OF EL CAPITAN ARE PARTICULARLY FINE BUT MOST OF THE GREAT YOSEMITE AVALANCHES FLOW IN REGULAR CHANNELS LIKE CASCADES AND WATERFALLS WHEN THE SNOW FIRST GIVES WAY ON THE UPPER SLOPES OF THEIR BASINS
THE AVERAGE DEPTH ACTUALLY FOUND AT ANY TIME SELDOM EXCEEDS TEN FEET IN THE FOREST REGIONS OR FIFTEEN FEET ALONG THE SLOPES OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS AFTER SNOW STORMS COME AVALANCHES
HE WAS DRUNK THEY SAID OR OUT OF HIS MIND WHEN HE WAS TURNED OFF
THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY A CRUEL EXPERIENCE THAT THE ANTIPATHY OF THE NATION TO THEIR RELIGION WAS NOT A FANCY WHICH WOULD YIELD TO THE MANDATE OF A PRINCE BUT A PROFOUND SENTIMENT
BORDERING ON HIGH TREASON FROM HIS INDICTMENT AND FROM THE SCANTY ACCOUNT WHICH REMAINS OF HIS TRIAL IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT HE WAS NOT EVEN ACCUSED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE DESIGN OF MURDERING THE ROYAL BROTHERS THE MALIGNITY WITH WHICH SO OBSCURE A MAN
IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT THE VIOLENT COMPRESSION OF SO POWERFUL AND ELASTIC A SPRING WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AS VIOLENT A RECOIL THE ROMAN CATHOLIC PEERS
HE DIED WITH COURAGE AND WITH MANY PIOUS EXPRESSIONS BUT SHOWED BY LOOK AND GESTURE SUCH STRONG RESENTMENT AT THE BARBARITY AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED THAT HIS ENEMIES SPREAD A CALUMNIOUS REPORT CONCERNING HIM
THOUGH AT SUCH TIMES ONE THINKS FAST ONE FINE YOSEMITE MORNING AFTER A HEAVY SNOWFALL BEING EAGER TO SEE AS MANY AVALANCHES AS POSSIBLE AND WIDE VIEWS OF THE FOREST AND SUMMIT PEAKS IN THEIR NEW WHITE ROBES
BEEN ONE CHARLES THE FIRST WAS REGARDED BY THE CHURCH AS HER MARTYR IF CHARLES THE SECOND HAD PLOTTED AGAINST HER HE HAD PLOTTED IN SECRET IN PUBLIC HE HAD EVER PROFESSED HIMSELF
AT THE PORCHES OF ITALIAN CONVENTS SUCH WAS THE FEELING OF WILLIAM HERBERT EARL OF POWIS WHO WAS GENERALLY REGARDED AS THE CHIEF OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARISTOCRACY
IS A TASTE WHICH EVEN MEN NOT NATURALLY CRUEL MAY BY HABIT SPEEDILY ACQUIRE THE BAR AND THE BENCH UNITED TO BROWBEAT THE UNFORTUNATE WHIG THE JURY NAMED BY A COURTLY SHERIFF
VARYING GREATLY IN FORM SIZE BEHAVIOR AND IN THE SONGS THEY SING SOME ON THE SMOOTH SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE SHORT AND BROAD OTHERS LONG AND RIVER LIKE IN THE SIDE CANYONS OF YOSEMITES
AND ALL THE LANDSCAPE IS GLOWING LIKE A BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE THEN THE STREAMS ARE AT THEIR LOWEST EBB WITH SCARCE A MEMORY LEFT OF THEIR WILD SPRING FLOODS
SUFFERED DEATH IN CHEAPSIDE SHE LEFT A PAPER WRITTEN INDEED IN NO GRACEFUL STYLE YET SUCH AS WAS READ BY MANY THOUSANDS WITH COMPASSION AND HORROR MY FAULT SHE SAID
AND ARE NOW SINGING THEIR BEST SONGS WITH THE STREAMS IN TRANQUIL MELLOW AUTUMN WHEN THE YEAR'S WORK IS ABOUT DONE AND THE FRUITS ARE RIPE BIRDS AND SEEDS OUT OF THEIR NESTS
BUT HE HAD STILL TO LISTEN TO REMONSTRANCES SIMILAR IN EFFECT THOUGH UTTERED IN A TONE EVEN MORE CAUTIOUS AND SUBDUED SOME MEN WHO HAD HITHERTO SERVED HIM BUT TOO STRENUOUSLY FOR THEIR OWN FAME AND FOR THE PUBLIC WELFARE
BESIDES THESE COMMON AFTER STORM AVALANCHES THAT ARE TO BE FOUND NOT ONLY IN THE YOSEMITE BUT IN ALL THE DEEP SHEER WALLED CANYON OF THE RANGE THERE ARE TWO OTHER IMPORTANT KINDS
IN ALL MY MOUNTAINEERING I HAVE ENJOYED ONLY ONE AVALANCHE RIDE AND THE START WAS SO SUDDEN AND THE END CAME SO SOON I HAD BUT LITTLE TIME TO THINK OF THE DANGER THAT ATTENDS THIS SORT OF TRAVEL
LEAPING FROM BENCH TO BENCH SPREADING AND NARROWING AND THROWING OFF CLOUDS OF WHIRLING DUST LIKE THE SPRAY OF FOAMING CATARACTS COMPARED WITH WATERFALLS AND CASCADES
THE COMMERCIAL GRANDEES HOWEVER THOUGH IN GENERAL HOSTILE TO POPERY AND TO ARBITRARY POWER HAD YET BEEN TOO SCRUPULOUS OR TOO TIMID TO INCUR THE GUILT OF HIGH TREASON ONE OF THE MOST CONSIDERABLE AMONG THEM
VENEERING WITH GREAT CONTEMPT AND WHAT DOES VENEERING KNOW ABOUT ME WAS HE NOT YOUR TRUSTEE NO I HAVE NO TRUSTEE BUT THE ONE YOU SAW ON THE DAY WHEN YOU FRAUDULENTLY MARRIED ME
FOR THE POOR LITTLE HARMLESS GENTLEMAN ONCE HAD HIS FANCY LIKE THE REST OF US AND SHE DIDN'T ANSWER AS SHE OFTEN DOES NOT AND HE THINKS THE ADORABLE BRIDESMAID IS LIKE THE FANCY AS SHE WAS THEN WHICH SHE IS NOT AT ALL
AND THAT IF THE FANCY HAD NOT MARRIED SOME ONE ELSE FOR MONEY BUT HAD MARRIED HIM FOR LOVE HE AND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY WHICH THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AND THAT SHE HAS A TENDERNESS FOR HIM STILL WHEREAS HER TOUGHNESS IS A PROVERB
THAT THE POKEY UNKNOWNS SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN BEING UNIMPRESSIBLE THEY PERSIST IN NOT BEING FRIGHTENED BY THE GOLD AND SILVER CAMELS AND THEY ARE BANDED TOGETHER TO DEFY THE ELABORATELY CHASED ICE PAILS THEY EVEN SEEM TO UNITE IN SOME VAGUE UTTERANCE OF THE SENTIMENT
IN A NUT SHELL THERE'S THE STATE OF THE CASE YOU SOUGHT ME OUT TUT
BUT MY DEAR PODSNAP QUOTH VENEERING THERE IS A TRIED FRIEND OF OUR FAMILY WHO I THINK AND HOPE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME PODSNAP IS THE FRIEND ON WHOM THIS AGREEABLE DUTY ALMOST NATURALLY DEVOLVES THAT FRIEND
AND AFTER HER APPEARS ALFRED WHOM TWEMLOW HAS SEEN ONCE IN HIS LIFETIME TO DO THE SAME AND TO MAKE A PASTY SORT OF GLITTER AS IF HE WERE CONSTRUCTED FOR CANDLE LIGHT ONLY AND HAD BEEN LET OUT INTO DAYLIGHT BY SOME GRAND MISTAKE AND AFTER THAT COMES MISSUS VENEERING
AWARE OF HER ENEMY LADY TIPPINS TRIES A YOUTHFUL SALLY OR TWO AND TRIES THE EYE GLASS BUT FROM THE IMPENETRABLE CAP AND SNORTING ARMOUR OF THE STONEY AUNT ALL WEAPONS REBOUND POWERLESS ANOTHER OBJECTIONABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IS
WHICH MAKES SEVEN TWEMLOW THOUGHT AND CONFIDENTIALLY RETIRING WITH HIM INTO THE CONSERVATORY IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT VENEERING IS HIS CO TRUSTEE AND THAT THEY ARE ARRANGING ABOUT THE FORTUNE BUFFERS ARE EVEN OVERHEARD TO WHISPER
TO SET THOSE BLARING IMAGES SO HIGH AND TO CAUSE US SMALLER VERMIN AS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HENBANE OR OPIUM TO CRY OUT NIGHT AND DAY RELIEVE US OF OUR MONEY SCATTER IT FOR US BUY US AND SELL US RUIN US ONLY WE BESEECH YE TAKE RANK AMONG THE POWERS OF THE EARTH AND FATTEN ON US
FOLLOWS EVERY LIVELY REMARK MADE BY THAT DEAR CREATURE WITH AN AUDIBLE SNORT WHICH MAY BE REFERABLE TO A CHRONIC COLD IN THE HEAD BUT MAY ALSO BE REFERABLE TO INDIGNATION AND CONTEMPT
THE MATURE YOUNG LADY IN THE LIGHT OF A SISTER AND ALFRED LAMMLE THE MATURE YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN THE LIGHT OF A BROTHER TWEMLOW HAS ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WENT TO SCHOOL AS A JUNIOR WITH ALFRED HE HAS ANSWERED NOT EXACTLY WHETHER SOPHRONIA WAS ADOPTED BY HIS MOTHER
AND A LOOK AT THE MARRIAGE SERVICE IN ORDER THAT HE MAY CUT IN AT THE RIGHT PLACE TO MORROW AND HE IS LOW AND FEELS IT DULL OVER THE LIVERY STABLE YARD AND IS DISTINCTLY AWARE OF A DINT IN HIS HEART MADE BY THE MOST ADORABLE OF THE ADORABLE BRIDESMAIDS
HAS BUT AN INDIGESTIBLE APPEARANCE HOWEVER ALL THE THINGS INDISPENSABLE TO BE SAID ARE SAID
BROODING OVER THE FIRE WITH HIS DRIED LITTLE HEAD IN HIS DRIED LITTLE HANDS AND HIS DRIED LITTLE ELBOWS ON HIS DRIED LITTLE KNEES TWEMLOW IS MELANCHOLY NO ADORABLE TO BEAR ME COMPANY HERE THINKS HE NO ADORABLE AT THE CLUB
POKEY UNKNOWNS AMAZED TO FIND HOW INTIMATELY THEY KNOW VENEERING PLUCK UP SPIRIT FOLD THEIR ARMS AND BEGIN TO CONTRADICT HIM BEFORE BREAKFAST WHAT TIME MISSUS VENEERING CARRYING BABY DRESSED AS A BRIDESMAID FLITS ABOUT AMONG THE COMPANY
TO GIVE HIS MIND TO THE CARVING AND GILDING OF THE PILGRIMS GOING TO CANTERBURY IN ORDER TO SHOW TWEMLOW THE LITTLE FLOURISH HE HAS PREPARED FOR THE TRUMPETS OF FASHION DESCRIBING HOW THAT ON THE SEVENTEENTH INSTANT AT SAINT JAMES'S CHURCH THE REVEREND BLANK BLANK ASSISTED BY THE REVEREND DASH DASH
ON THE SANDS AT SHANKLIN IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT MISTER AND MISSUS LAMMLE HAVE WALKED FOR SOME TIME ON THE SHANKLIN SANDS AND ONE MAY SEE BY THEIR FOOTPRINTS THAT THEY HAVE NOT WALKED ARM IN ARM AND THAT THEY HAVE NOT WALKED IN A STRAIGHT TRACK
I HAVE ORIGINATED NOTHING THE DOUBLE EDGED QUESTION WAS YOURS WAS MINE THE BRIDE REPEATS AND HER PARASOL BREAKS IN HER ANGRY HAND
TO SO GREAT AN EXTENT UPON TRUST BUT THE FOLLY IS COMMITTED ON BOTH SIDES I CANNOT GET RID OF YOU YOU CANNOT GET RID OF ME WHAT FOLLOWS SHAME AND MISERY THE BRIDE BITTERLY REPLIES I DON'T KNOW A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING FOLLOWS
BUT YOU ASKED SOMEBODY TOO COME MISSUS LAMMLE ADMISSION FOR ADMISSION YOU ASKED SOMEBODY
SHE HAS A LARGE GOLD EYE GLASS HAS LADY TIPPINS TO SURVEY THE PROCEEDINGS WITH IF SHE HAD ONE IN EACH EYE IT MIGHT KEEP THAT OTHER DROOPING LID UP AND LOOK MORE UNIFORM BUT PERENNIAL YOUTH IS IN HER ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS AND HER LIST OF LOVERS IS FULL
WHAT OF IT SAYS MISTER LAMMLE HAVE YOU THE FACE TO UTTER THE WORD TO ME THE FACE TOO REPLIED MISSUS LAMMLE STARING AT HIM WITH COLD SCORN PRAY HOW DARE YOU SIR UTTER THE WORD TO ME I NEVER DID
AND A LITTLE MORE SILENCE MISTER LAMMLE BREAKS THE LATTER YOU SHALL PROCEED IN YOUR OWN WAY
MISERABLE IS THAT THE WAY YOU DO YOUR DUTY BEYOND AN IMPRESSION THAT HE IS TO SIT UPON MY KNEE AND BE SECONDED AT SOME POINT OF THE SOLEMNITIES
YOU TELL ME TELL ME FORSOOTH SHE AFFECTS NOT TO KNOW THAT HIS EYES ARE FASTENED ON HER AS SHE DROOPS HER HEAD AGAIN BUT HER WHOLE FIGURE REVEALS THAT SHE KNOWS IT UNEASILY ENOUGH OF THIS COME DO YOU HEAR GET UP
VENEERING'S FLOWERS SNUB NOSED ONE RATHER PRETTY BUT TOO CONSCIOUS OF HER STOCKINGS BONNETS THREE POUND TEN
SO WE AGREE TO KEEP THE FACT TO OURSELVES YOU AGREE IF IT IS POSSIBLE I DO POSSIBLE
AND HE SAYS HE DOES KNOW HIM AND PODSNAP RECIPROCATES APPARENTLY PODSNAP HAS BEEN SO WROUGHT UPON IN A SHORT TIME AS TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS BEEN INTIMATE IN THE HOUSE MANY MANY MANY YEARS
OF BATH HIS DESCRIPTION IS OF MINUTE WORMS IN FILMY ENVELOPES HE TRIES TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR SEGREGATION THE MYSTERY OF IT IS WHAT COULD HAVE BROUGHT SO MANY OF THEM TOGETHER
THE WRITER ABANDONS THE FIRST OR ABSOLUTE EXCLUSION AND MODIFIES IT WITH THE EXPLANATION THAT THE DAY BEFORE A REPORTED FALL OF STONES IN TUSCANY JUNE SIXTEENTH SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR THERE HAD BEEN AN ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS
IS PROFESSOR GRAVES ACCOUNT COMMUNICATED BY PROFESSOR DEWEY THAT UPON THE EVENING OF AUGUST THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN A LIGHT WAS SEEN IN AMHERST A FALLING OBJECT SOUND
UPON REMOVING THIS COVERING A BUFF COLORED PULPY SUBSTANCE OF THE CONSISTENCY OF SOFT SOAP WAS FOUND OF AN OFFENSIVE SUFFOCATING SMELL
IT IS SAID THAT THESE PHENOMENA WERE CAUSED BY PARTICLES OF VOLCANIC DUST THAT WERE CAST HIGH IN THE AIR BY KRAKATOA THIS IS THE EXPLANATION THAT WAS AGREED UPON IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE BUT FOR SEVEN YEARS THE ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA CONTINUED
IN A WHIRLWIND NOW I CAN'T SAY THAT NOSTOC IS ALWAYS GREENISH ANY MORE THAN I CAN SAY THAT BLACKBIRDS ARE ALWAYS BLACK HAVING SEEN A WHITE ONE WE SHALL QUOTE A SCIENTIST WHO KNEW OF FLESH COLORED NOSTOC WHEN
BUT THE COMMON IMPRESSION OF THEM IS ONLY A RETREAT OF ATTEMPTED EXCLUSION THAT ONLY TWO KINDS OF SUBSTANCE FALL FROM THE SKY METALLIC AND STONY
OR DATA OF THEM BOMBARDED THE WALLS RAISED AGAINST THEM MONTHLY REVIEW
THE EXCLUSIONISTS EXPLANATION AT THAT TIME WAS THAT STONES DO NOT FALL FROM THE SKY
THESE DATA ARE SO IMPROPER THEY'RE OBSCENE TO THE SCIENCE OF TODAY BUT WE SHALL SEE THAT SCIENCE
A BUFF COLORED PULPY SUBSTANCE WAS FOUND
THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BELONG HERE LONDON TIMES APRIL NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX FALL OF FISH THAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THEY HAD DISGORGED PROFESSOR FASSIG LISTS THE SUBSTANCE IN HIS BIBLIOGRAPHY AS FISH SPAWN MC ATEE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
AS MUCH AS IT CAN EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THIS EARTH THIS BOOK IS AN ASSEMBLAGE OF DATA OF EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THIS EARTH WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT OUR DATA HAVE BEEN DAMNED UPON NO CONSIDERATION FOR INDIVIDUAL MERITS OR DEMERITS
LEAVING A JELLY LIKE MASS ON THE GROUND WE ARE TOLD THAT THIS SUBSTANCE FELL ONLY THREE FEET AWAY FROM AN OBSERVER IN THE REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE NINETY FOUR ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM GREG TO PROFESSOR BADEN POWELL
IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE COMMON SENSE TO SAY THAT THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STATIONARY OVER THE TOWN OF BATH SEVERAL DAYS THE SEVEN BLACK RAINS OF SLAINS THE FOUR RED RAINS OF SIENA
SO TO KNOW WAS CONVENIENT WHEN WE COME TO REPORTED FALLS OF GELATINOUS SUBSTANCES I'D LIKE IT TO BE NOTICED HOW OFTEN THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS WHITISH OR GRAYISH IN LOOKING UP THE SUBJECT MYSELF I HAVE READ ONLY
UPON MARCH THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AT OLYMPIAN SPRINGS BATH COUNTY KENTUCKY FLAKES OF A SUBSTANCE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF FELL FROM THE SKY FROM A CLEAR SKY WE'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT WAS SAID
WRITES OF THE SUBSTANCE THAT HAD SO COMPLETELY OR BEAUTIFULLY IF BEAUTY IS COMPLETENESS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOSTOC IT TURNED OUT TO BE LUNG TISSUE ALSO
VISCOUS AND PUTRID
LUMPS OF JELLY WERE FOUND ON THE GROUND AT RAHWAY NEW JERSEY THE SUBSTANCE WAS WHITISH OR RESEMBLED THE COAGULATED WHITE OF AN EGG THAT MISTER H H GARLAND OF NELSON COUNTY VIRGINIA HAD FOUND A JELLY LIKE SUBSTANCE
HAD BLOWN UP TERRIFIC WE'RE TOLD THAT THE SOUND WAS HEARD TWO THOUSAND MILES AND THAT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY PERSONS WERE KILLED SEEMS JUST A LITTLE UNSCIENTIFIC OR IMPOSITIVE TO ME
BEFORE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE WROTE A GREAT DEAL UPON HIS THEORY OF COSMIC DUST AND PROFESSOR CLEVELAND ABBE CONTENDED AGAINST THE KRAKATOAN EXPLANATION BUT THAT THIS IS THE ORTHODOXY OF THE MAIN BODY OF SCIENTISTS
FOR INSTANCE THE TURTLE OF VICKSBURG
HAD BEEN FOUND AT NEARLY THE SAME PLACE PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK WAS INVITED BY PROFESSOR GRAVES TO EXAMINE IT EXACTLY LIKE THE FIRST ONE CORRESPONDED IN SIZE AND COLOR AND CONSISTENCY THE CHEMIC REACTIONS WERE THE SAME PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK
AFTER A HEAVY RAINFALL WE ARE NOT TOLD OF NOSTOC THIS TIME IT IS SAID THAT THE OBJECT CONTAINED NUMEROUS EGGS
MY OWN CHIEF REASON FOR INDIGNATION HERE THAT THIS PREPOSTEROUS EXPLANATION INTERFERES WITH SOME OF MY OWN ENORMITIES IT WOULD COST ME TOO MUCH EXPLAINING IF I SHOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE
NEVER BOTHER TO FIGHT A THING SET ITS OWN PARTS FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER WE ARE MERGING AWAY FROM CARNAL TO GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE AND HERE THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF INSTANCES OR REPORTS OF INSTANCES
SMALL FROGS FELL AT WIGAN ENGLAND NATURE EIGHTY SEVEN TEN THAT JUNE TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN ELEVEN AT ETON BUCKS ENGLAND THE GROUND WAS FOUND COVERED WITH MASSES OF JELLY THE SIZE OF PEAS
RECOGNIZED IT IN A MOMENT IT WAS A GELATINOUS FUNGUS HE DID NOT SATISFY HIMSELF AS TO JUST THE EXACT SPECIES IT BELONGED TO BUT HE PREDICTED THAT SIMILAR FUNGI MIGHT SPRING UP WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
SAYS THAT ALL OUR DATA IN THIS RESPECT MUST BE
DOCTOR A MEAD EDWARDS PRESIDENT OF THE NEWARK SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION
I CRIED SHE STOPPED THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT AND BOUNCED OUT OF THE ROOM BUT I HEARD HER TURN THE KEY OF THE DOOR I PROCEEDED WITH MY DRESSING AS FAST AS I COULD THEN AND THE MOMENT I WAS READY OPENED THE WINDOW
BUT MINE AND THOSE OF TWO OF MY BROTHERS WAS FIXED UPON HIM I THINK HOWEVER THAT IT WAS IN PART THE FAULT OF CERTAIN TEACHING OF HIS OWN BETTER FITTED FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE PAID SO LITTLE HEED EVEN TOM WITH ALL HIS STARING
AND GENERALLY LOOKED AS IF HE WERE PONDERING NEXT SUNDAY'S SERMON HIS HEAD WAS GREY AND A LITTLE BENT AS IF HE WERE GATHERING TRUTH FROM THE GROUND ONCE I CAME UPON HIM IN THE GARDEN STANDING WITH HIS FACE UP TO HEAVEN
MEANTIME I OBSERVED A CURIOUS MOTION IN THE HEAVENLY HOST THEY KEPT LOOKING AT ME AND THEN AT THE CORNER WHERE THE LADDER STOOD AND TALKING ON FOR I SAW THEIR LIPS MOVING VERY FAST AND I THOUGHT BY THE MOTION OF THEM THAT THEY WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THE LADDER
AND SEEING ALL HIS OWN BROTHERS COMING RIDING TOWARDS HIM OR THE GRAND RUSH OF THE SEA WAVES OVER THE BEWILDERED HOSTS OF THE EGYPTIANS WE LAY AND LISTENED WITH ALL THE MORE ENJOYMENT THAT WHILE THE FIRE WAS BURNING SO BRIGHTLY
WHEN I OFFERED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS TO BRING HER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE
YOU WILL AND YOU WON'T SHE REPEATED STANDING STARING AT ME AS I LEISURELY BUT WITH HANDS TREMBLING PARTLY WITH FEAR PARTLY WITH RAGE WAS FASTENING MY NETHER GARMENTS TO MY WAISTCOAT
AND SHE NODDING BACK TO HIM WITH A KNOWING LOOK AND THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH DRAWN DOWN I HAVE VAGUE MEMORIES OF HAVING HEARD THEM TALK AT TIMES I FEEL AS IF I COULD YET RECALL SOMETHING OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT IT VANISHES THE MOMENT I TRY TO CATCH IT
FOR I NEVER SAW ONE OF HIS PARISHIONERS SALUTE HIM IN THE ROAD WITHOUT A LOOK OF MY FATHER HIMSELF PASSING LIKE A SOLEMN CLOUD OVER THE FACE OF THE MAN OR WOMAN FOR US WE FEARED AND LOVED HIM BOTH AT ONCE I DO NOT REMEMBER EVER BEING PUNISHED BY HIM
OF COURSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND A BETTER SERMON THAN ANY OTHER CLERGYMAN WHATEVER COULD HAVE PREACHED BUT WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ME I MAY AS WELL CONFESS AT ONCE THAT I NEVER HAD THE LEAST DOUBT THAT MY FATHER WAS THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD
THERE SHE SET MY PORRIDGE BEFORE ME WHICH I DECLINED TO EAT WELL IF YOU WON'T EAT GOOD FOOD YOU SHALL GO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT IT I TELL YOU I WON'T GO TO SCHOOL SHE CAUGHT ME UP IN HER ARMS
THAT IS THE NEAREST I CAN COME TO THE SPELLING OF THE NAME THEY GAVE HIM THE TOMB WAS CLOSE BY THE SIDE OF THE PEW WITH ONLY A FLAGGED PASSAGE BETWEEN IT STOOD IN A HOLLOW IN THE WALL AND THE KNIGHT LAY UNDER THE ARCH OF THE RECESS SO SILENT SO PATIENT
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT I TELL YOU I WON'T GO AND I TELL YOU WE'LL SEE ABOUT IT I WON'T GO TILL I'VE SEEN PAPA IF HE SAYS I'M TO GO I WILL OF COURSE BUT I WON'T GO FOR YOU
THESE GAVE ENTIRE SATISFACTION TO THOSE OF HIS PARISHIONERS WHOM I HAPPENED TO HEAR SPEAK OF THEM BUT ALTHOUGH I LOVED THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE AND LIKED TO LOOK AT HIS FACE AS HE STOOD UP THERE IN THE ANCIENT PULPIT CLAD IN HIS GOWN AND BANDS I NEVER CARED MUCH ABOUT WHAT HE SAID
CHAPTER SEVEN MISSUS MITCHELL IS DEFEATED AFTER THIS TALK WITH MY FATHER I FELL INTO A SLEEP OF PERFECT CONTENTMENT AND NEVER THOUGHT OF WHAT MIGHT BE ON THE MORROW TILL THE MORROW CAME
PAPA PAPA I SOBBED DON'T SEND ME TO THAT HORRID SCHOOL I CAN LEARN TO READ WITHOUT THAT OLD WOMAN TO TEACH ME REALLY MISSUS MITCHELL SAID MY FATHER TAKING ME BY THE HAND AND LEADING ME TOWARDS HER WHERE SHE STOOD VISIBLY FLAMING WITH RAGE AND ANNOYANCE
THE RAIN POURING SO THICK THAT I PUT OUT MY HAND IN FRONT OF ME TO TRY WHETHER I COULD SEE IT THROUGH THE VEIL OF THE FALLING WATER THE RIVER WHICH IN GENERAL WAS TO BE SEEN ONLY IN GLIMPSES FROM THE HOUSE FOR IT RAN AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLLOW
AND GET UP ABOVE THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE STARS BY THE LADDER OF SUN RAYS BUT THIS I SAY I THOUGHT AFTERWARDS
AND HIS ONE GLASS OF WINE SET ON THE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE HE WOULD SIT FOR AN HOUR TALKING AWAY TO US IN HIS GENTLE SLOW DEEP VOICE TELLING US STORY AFTER STORY OUT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
AND WERE TALKING VERY EARNESTLY AND ALL THE STARS HAD GATHERED ROUND THEM I COULD NOT HEAR A WORD THEY SAID BUT I CONCLUDED THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT MY LITTLE BROTHER I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE SORRY I SAID TO MYSELF AND I TRIED HARD BUT I COULD NOT FEEL SORRY
IT WAS VERY QUEER TALK INDEED ABOUT ME I FANCIED BUT A THREAD OF STRONG SENSE RAN THROUGH IT ALL WHEN THE DREAM HAD BEEN VERY VIVID I WOULD SOMETIMES THINK OF IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NEXT DAY AND LOOK UP TO THE SUN SAYING TO MYSELF
CHAPTER THREE MY FATHER MY FATHER WAS A TALL STAID SOLEMN MAN WHO WALKED SLOWLY WITH LONG STRIDES HE SPOKE VERY LITTLE
AND DON'T KEEP ME WAITING ALL DAY YOU NEEDN'T WAIT MISSUS MITCHELL I AM DRESSING AS FAST AS I CAN IS PAPA IN HIS STUDY YET NO AND YOU NEEDN'T THINK TO SEE HIM HE'S ANGRY ENOUGH WITH YOU I'LL WARRANT
HE LOOKED SO SAD I HAVE SAID THAT AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER SHE WAS AN INVALID HENCE SHE WAS UNABLE TO BE MUCH WITH US SHE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL IN MY MEMORY BUT DURING THE LAST MONTHS OF HER LIFE WE SELDOM SAW HER
AND THE MOON WAS JUST SUCH A ONE AS YOU MAY SEE THE COW JUMPING OVER IN THE PICTURED NURSERY RHYME SHE WAS A CRESCENT OF COURSE THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE A FACE DRAWN IN THE HOLLOW
THEN I GREW AWARE OF THE DANGER I WAS IN OF BEING CARRIED OFF ONCE MORE TO SCHOOL INDEED EXCEPT MY FATHER INTERFERED THE THING WAS ALMOST INEVITABLE I THOUGHT HE WOULD PROTECT ME BUT I HAD NO ASSURANCE HE WAS GONE AGAIN
I CANNOT TELL ANY BETTER THAN MOST OF MY READERS HOW AND WHEN I BEGAN TO COME AWAKE OR WHAT IT WAS THAT WAKENED ME I MEAN I CANNOT REMEMBER WHEN I BEGAN TO REMEMBER OR WHAT FIRST GOT SET DOWN IN MY MEMORY AS WORTH REMEMBERING
THAT IS TO SAY THE HEAVY INFANTRY THAT
BUT ARE COMPELLED TO DEPEND BOTH FOR SUPPLYING THE CREWS IN SERVICE
THE SICYONIANS ALSO SENT OFF TWO HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY AT SAME TIME AS THE CORINTHIANS UNDER THE COMMAND OF SARGEUS A SICYONIAN
SOME THOUGHT MIGHT HOLD OUT ONE YEAR SOME TWO NONE MORE THAN THREE IF THE PELOPONNESIANS INVADED THEIR COUNTRY NOW SEVENTEEN YEARS AFTER THE FIRST INVASION AFTER HAVING ALREADY SUFFERED FROM ALL THE EVILS OF WAR
BOEOTARCHS THE MYCALESSIANS LOST A LARGE PROPORTION OF THEIR POPULATION WHILE MYCALESSUS THUS EXPERIENCED A CALAMITY FOR ITS EXTENT AS LAMENTABLE AS ANY THAT HAPPENED IN THE WAR
HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT ITS USE WERE NOW PREPARING TO DISPATCH A FORCE OF HEAVY INFANTRY
A LITTLE THE FIRST AND BROUGHT THEM UP TO THE WALL OF THE ATHENIANS
SUDDENLY THE SYRACUSANS HAD MANNED THEIR SHIPS AND AGAIN SAILED AGAINST THEM AND THE ATHENIANS IN GREAT CONFUSION AND MOST OF THEM FASTING GOT ON BOARD AND WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PUT OUT TO MEET THEM FOR SOME TIME BOTH PARTIES REMAINED ON THE DEFENSIVE WITHOUT ENGAGING
TO MAKE USE OF THEM IF POSSIBLE IN THE VOYAGE ALONGSHORE TO INJURE THE ENEMY
IN ADDITION TO OTHER IMPROVEMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE FORMER SEA FIGHT WHICH THEY NOW ADOPTED IN THE EQUIPMENT OF THEIR NAVY THEY CUT DOWN THEIR PROWS TO A SMALLER COMPASS TO MAKE THEM MORE SOLID AND MADE THEIR CHEEKS STOUTER AND FROM THESE LET STAYS INTO THE VESSELS SIDES
FOR OUR PRESENT CONFEDERATES NAXOS AND CATANA ARE INCAPABLE OF SUPPLYING US THERE IS ONLY ONE THING MORE WANTING TO OUR OPPONENTS I MEAN THE DEFECTION OF OUR ITALIAN MARKETS IF THEY WERE TO SEE YOU NEGLECT TO RELIEVE US FROM OUR PRESENT CONDITION
THE ATHENIANS TREATED THIS PROPOSITION WITH CONTEMPT AND DISMISSED THE HERALD WITHOUT AN ANSWER AFTER THIS BOTH SIDES BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR ACTION GYLIPPUS OBSERVING THAT THE SYRACUSANS WERE IN DISORDER AND DID NOT EASILY FALL INTO LINE
WITH MORE EASE THE SYRACUSAN SHIPS FIGHTING OFF THE MOUTH OF THE HARBOUR FORCED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE ATHENIAN VESSELS AND SAILING IN WITHOUT ANY ORDER FELL FOUL OF ONE ANOTHER AND TRANSFERRED THE VICTORY TO THE ATHENIANS
AS THE ENEMY WILL OBTAIN HIS SICILIAN REINFORCEMENTS SHORTLY THOSE FROM PELOPONNESE AFTER A LONGER INTERVAL AND UNLESS YOU ATTEND TO THE MATTER THE FORMER WILL BE HERE BEFORE YOU WHILE THE LATTER WILL ELUDE YOU AS THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE SUCH WERE THE
TO BE TOLD THE BEST SIDE OF THINGS AND THEN TO BLAME THE TELLER IF THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH HE HAS RAISED IN YOUR MINDS ARE NOT ANSWERED BY THE RESULT AND I THEREFORE THOUGHT IT SAFEST TO DECLARE TO YOU THE TRUTH
WHO ESCAPED WERE CONDUCTED TO SYRACUSE ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE CAMARINAEANS ALSO CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF SYRACUSE WITH FIVE HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY THREE HUNDRED DARTERS AND AS MANY ARCHERS WHILE THE GELOANS SENT CREWS FOR FIVE SHIPS FOUR HUNDRED DARTERS AND TWO HUNDRED HORSE
OF GYLIPPUS AND THE SYRACUSANS FORMED IN ORDER OF BATTLE GYLIPPUS HALTED AT A SHORT DISTANCE OFF AND SENT ON A HERALD TO TELL THEM THAT IF THEY WOULD EVACUATE SICILY WITH BAG AND BAGGAGE WITHIN FIVE DAYS TIME HE WAS WILLING TO MAKE A TRUCE ACCORDINGLY
AS THE ATHENIANS WERE EXPECTED WITH A FRESH ARMY AND IF THE ONE ALREADY THERE COULD BE DESTROYED BEFORE THE OTHER ARRIVED THE WAR WOULD BE AT AN END WHILE THE CONTENDING PARTIES IN SICILY WERE THUS ENGAGED DEMOSTHENES HAVING NOW GOT TOGETHER
HIS ARRIVAL CHANCED AT A CRITICAL MOMENT THE ATHENIANS HAD ALREADY FINISHED A DOUBLE WALL OF SIX OR SEVEN FURLONGS TO THE GREAT HARBOUR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL PORTION
AND SAILED AGAINST THEIR SIDES AND DISCHARGED FROM THENCE THEIR DARTS UPON THE SAILORS
THE ATHENIANS NOW SAILED BACK TO NAUPACTUS AND THE CORINTHIANS IMMEDIATELY SET UP A TROPHY AS VICTORS BECAUSE THEY HAD DISABLED A GREATER NUMBER OF THE ENEMY'S SHIPS
WITH A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND SOMEONE TO SUCCEED ME AS A DISEASE IN THE KIDNEYS UNFITS ME FOR RETAINING MY POST I HAVE I THINK SOME CLAIM ON YOUR INDULGENCE
SHOULD PUT AN END TO THE WAR THIS HE PREVENTED AND REASSURED THEM BY TELLING THEM THAT MORE VESSELS WERE STILL TO ARRIVE AND THAT GYLIPPUS SON OF CLEANDRIDAS HAD BEEN DISPATCHED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS TO TAKE THE COMMAND
LED THEM AGAINST MYCALESSUS THE NIGHT HE PASSED UNOBSERVED NEAR THE TEMPLE OF HERMES NOT QUITE TWO MILES FROM MYCALESSUS AND AT DAYBREAK ASSAULTED AND TOOK THE TOWN WHICH IS NOT A LARGE ONE THE INHABITANTS BEING OFF THEIR GUARD AND NOT EXPECTING THAT ANY ONE WOULD EVER COME UP
TAKE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF DEPARTING TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CITIES
AND ISLANDERS WITH THE MOTLEY RABBLE THAT ACCOMPANIED THEM AND OF DRIVING THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY AFTER THIS HE EMBRACED THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT OFFERED OF AGAIN LEADING THEM AGAINST THE ENEMY
PUT OFF ANY IMMEDIATE ATTACK UPON THE ATHENIANS DEMOSTHENES AND EURYMEDON
IF IT IS DESIRABLE FOR YOU TO KNOW THE REAL STATE OF THINGS HERE BEFORE TAKING YOUR MEASURES
NOW NICIAS AND THE ATHENIANS HELD THE OPINION THAT EVEN IF THE SYRACUSANS SHOULD NOT WISH TO OFFER BATTLE IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO PREVENT THE BUILDING OF THE CROSS WALL AS IT ALREADY
AND A VIGOROUS PROSECUTION OF THE WAR BUT THE LACEDAEMONIANS DERIVED MOST ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE BELIEF THAT ATHENS WITH TWO WARS ON HER HANDS
AND UNAPPROACHED BY ANY IN SUDDENNESS AND IN HORROR
MAKING IT HIS AIM NOW TO KEEP ON THE DEFENSIVE AND TO AVOID ANY UNNECESSARY DANGER
FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER THAT ANY SHIP THAT WAS HARD PRESSED MIGHT BE ABLE TO RETREAT IN SAFETY AND SAIL OUT AGAIN AT LEISURE THESE PREPARATIONS OCCUPIED THE ATHENIANS ALL DAY UNTIL NIGHTFALL
WE HAVE NOW THEREFORE BEEN FORCED BY THE NUMBERS OF THOSE OPPOSED TO US TO DISCONTINUE THE WORK OF CIRCUMVALLATION AND TO REMAIN INACTIVE BEING UNABLE TO MAKE USE EVEN OF ALL THE FORCE WE HAVE SINCE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR HEAVY INFANTRY
GUARD AT THIS POINT THEMSELVES DISPOSING THEIR CONFEDERATES ALONG THE REMAINDER OF THE WORKS
A GOOD NUMBER WHO WERE AFTER PLUNDER WERE ACTUALLY CAUGHT IN THE TOWN AND PUT TO DEATH ALTOGETHER THE THRACIANS HAD TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY KILLED OUT OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED
TO EFFECT AN ENTRANCE AND THEY CONSULTED ACCORDINGLY WHETHER THEY SHOULD KEEP SICILY ON THEIR RIGHT AND RISK SAILING IN BY SEA
WHERE THEY TOOK ON BOARD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
WE CANNOT SAY THAT DEATH IS NOT GOOD WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE GRAVE IS THE END OF THIS LIFE OR THE DOOR OF ANOTHER OR WHETHER THE NIGHT HERE IS NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE A DAWN
IMMEDIATELY HE ACCOSTED THEM
BUT THERE WAS NO NEWS OF CACAMBO
BUT I CARE LITTLE FOR HIS JOURNEY TO BRUNDUSIUM
JUST IN THE HAPPIEST SUNNIEST HOUR OF ALL THE VOYAGE WHILE EAGER WINDS ARE KISSING EVERY SAIL TO DASH AGAINST THE UNSEEN ROCK AND IN AN INSTANT HEAR THE BILLOWS ROAR OVER A SUNKEN SHIP
IN POINTING OUT FAULTS WHERE OTHERS SEE NOTHING BUT BEAUTIES THAT IS TO SAY REPLIED MARTIN THAT THERE IS SOME PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE WELL
MARTIN FOUND THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF REASON IN POCOCURANTE'S REMARKS
MARTIN WAS FOR THROWING THE BARON INTO THE SEA CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP
ARE ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST TASTE AND HIS LONG DESCRIPTION OF A PEST HOUSE IS GOOD ONLY FOR A GRAVE DIGGER
ALAS IT WAS I SIR INDEED ANSWERED PAQUETTE I SEE THAT YOU HAVE HEARD ALL
I GRANT SAID THE SENATOR THAT THE SECOND FOURTH AND SIXTH BOOKS OF HIS A ENEID ARE EXCELLENT
AND YET THE BEAUTIFUL CUNEGONDE HAS NOT ARRIVED
THAT TROY SO LONG BESIEGED WITHOUT BEING TAKEN ALL THESE TOGETHER CAUSED ME GREAT WEARINESS I HAVE SOMETIMES ASKED LEARNED MEN WHETHER THEY WERE NOT AS WEARY AS I OF THAT WORK
THE FLOWER OF HEALTH SHINES IN YOUR FACE YOUR EXPRESSION MAKES PLAIN YOUR HAPPINESS YOU HAVE A VERY PRETTY GIRL FOR YOUR RECREATION AND YOU SEEM WELL SATISFIED WITH YOUR STATE AS A THEATIN MY FAITH SIR SAID FRIAR GIROFLEE
THIS CATASTROPHE MADE A GREAT NOISE FOR SOME HOURS
THIS BRAVE AND TENDER MAN IN EVERY STORM OF LIFE WAS OAK AND ROCK BUT IN THE SUNSHINE HE WAS VINE AND FLOWER HE WAS THE FRIEND OF ALL HEROIC SOULS
WHICH WAS AS FOLLOWS MY FRIENDS I AM GOING TO DO THAT WHICH THE DEAD OFTEN PROMISED HE WOULD DO FOR ME THE LOVED AND LOVING BROTHER HUSBAND FATHER FRIEND
TO BE DISSECTED TO ROW IN THE GALLEYS IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE
OF THEIR PRIDES OF THEIR FOLLIES AND OF THE SONNETS WHICH ONE MUST MAKE OR HAVE MADE FOR THEM
MY PARENTS FORCED ME AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN TO PUT ON THIS DETESTABLE HABIT TO INCREASE THE FORTUNE OF A CURSED ELDER BROTHER WHOM GOD CONFOUND JEALOUSY DISCORD AND FURY DWELL IN THE CONVENT
OH WHAT A SUPERIOR MAN SAID CANDIDE BELOW HIS BREATH WHAT A GREAT GENIUS IS THIS POCOCURANTE NOTHING CAN PLEASE HIM
AND ONE THOUSAND TO FRIAR GIROFLEE I'LL ANSWER FOR IT SAID HE THAT WITH THIS THEY WILL BE HAPPY I DO NOT BELIEVE IT AT ALL SAID MARTIN YOU WILL PERHAPS WITH THESE PIASTRES ONLY RENDER THEM THE MORE UNHAPPY
I KNOW OF NOTHING IN SO BAD A TASTE SAID THE MASTER ALL YOU SEE HERE IS MERELY TRIFLING AFTER TO MORROW I WILL HAVE IT PLANTED WITH A NOBLER DESIGN
FOR MARTIN HE WAS FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT HE WOULD BE AS BADLY OFF ELSEWHERE AND THEREFORE BORE THINGS PATIENTLY
REPLIED THE SENATOR THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND AND NOT THREE DOZEN OF THEM GOOD FOR ANYTHING AS TO THOSE COLLECTIONS OF SERMONS WHICH ALTOGETHER ARE NOT WORTH A SINGLE PAGE OF SENECA AND THOSE HUGE VOLUMES OF THEOLOGY
I MAKE THEM LIE WITH ME SOMETIMES FOR I AM VERY TIRED OF THE LADIES OF THE TOWN OF THEIR COQUETRIES OF THEIR JEALOUSIES OF THEIR QUARRELS OF THEIR HUMOURS OF THEIR PETTINESSES
THE SCENE WAS INTENSELY DRAMATIC A FINE DRIZZLING RAIN WAS FALLING AND EVERY HEAD WAS BENT AND EVERY EAR TURNED TO CATCH THE IMPASSIONED WORDS OF ELOQUENCE AND HOPE THAT FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE FAMED ORATOR
PAQUETTE CONTINUED HER TRADE WHEREVER SHE WENT BUT MADE NOTHING OF IT
AND WHO WHILE MOSES REPRESENTS THE ETERNAL PRODUCING THE WORLD BY A WORD MAKES THE MESSIAH TAKE A GREAT PAIR OF COMPASSES FROM THE ARMOURY OF HEAVEN TO CIRCUMSCRIBE HIS WORK HOW CAN I HAVE ANY ESTEEM
THOSE GODS THAT ARE ALWAYS ACTIVE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING DECISIVE THAT HELEN WHO IS THE CAUSE OF THE WAR AND WHO YET SCARCELY APPEARS IN THE PIECE
THIS IS THE PRIVILEGE OF HUMANITY IN ALL OUR ITALY WE WRITE ONLY WHAT WE DO NOT THINK THOSE WHO INHABIT THE COUNTRY OF THE CAESARS AND THE ANTONINUSES DARE NOT ACQUIRE A SINGLE IDEA WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF A DOMINICAN FRIAR
AND IN A VOICE OF EXQUISITE CADENCE DELIVERED ONE OF HIS CHARACTERISTIC EULOGIES FOR THE DEAD
AND THE SAME FATE AWAITS US ALL WE TOO HAVE OUR RELIGION AND IT IS THIS HELP FOR THE LIVING HOPE FOR THE DEAD
WHISPERED WITH HIS LATEST BREATH I AM BETTER NOW LET US BELIEVE IN SPITE OF DOUBTS AND DOGMAS AND TEARS AND FEARS THAT THESE DEAR WORDS
AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
WITHERED HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH A GLANCE AND THEN SAID TO THE LADY WITH WHOM HE SEEMED TO BE QUITE FRIENDLY IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL RIDE WITH YOU AS FAR AS THE CROSS ROADS IT IS GETTING LATE AND THERE ARE TRAMPS ABOUT
AND LEFT HIM WITH HIS LITTLE MOUSTACHE AND HIS FLANNEL SUIT TO MEET ALONE THE YOUNG LADY WHO NOW CAME UP THE FRONT GARDEN WHEELING A BICYCLE THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE CAME OUT AND THE YOUNG LADY SPOKE TO HER
A TWO YEAR OLD BABY IN A LINEN SMOCK AND WHITE OPEN WORK SOCKS OH I WISH IT WOULDN'T OH I WISH IT WOULDN'T YOU BOYS MIGHT WISH AS WELL THEY ALL WISHED HARD FOR THE SIGHT WAS ENOUGH TO DISMAY THE MOST HEARTLESS
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW WHAT ANSWER THE YOUNG LADY INTENDED TO GIVE TO THIS GALLANT OFFER FOR DIRECTLY ANTHEA HEARD IT MADE SHE RUSHED OUT KNOCKING AGAINST THE PIG PAIL
WHO OF COURSE AFTER SUNSET WOULD BE A BABY AGAIN THE MAN TO MAN TONE SUCCEEDED I SHALL JUST RUN OVER TO MAIDSTONE ON MY BIKE SAID THE NEW LAMB AIRILY FINGERING THE LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE I CAN LUNCH AT THE CROWN AND PERHAPS I'LL HAVE A PULL ON THE RIVER
AND COME AND HAVE HIS NICE BREMMILK FORTUNATELY THE SUN SET AS THEY REACHED THE DOORSTEP THE BICYCLE DISAPPEARED AND MARTHA WAS SEEN TO CARRY INTO THE HOUSE THE REAL LIVE DARLING SLEEPY TWO YEAR OLD LAMB THE GROWN UP LAMB NAMELESS HENCE FORTH
YOU TRUST TO ME OLD CHAP AND COME HOME NOW AND IF YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF IN THE MORNING WE'LL ASK THE MILKMAN TO ASK THE DOCTOR TO COME THE POOR GROWN UP LAMB SAINT MAUR WAS REALLY ONE OF HIS CHRISTIAN NAMES SEEMED NOW TOO BEWILDERED TO RESIST
BECAUSE IT SEEMED SO UNFAIR THAT THE BABY WHO HAD ONLY THAT MORNING DESTROYED TWO CHEAP BUT HONEST WATCHES SHOULD NOW IN THE GROWN UPNESS CYRIL'S FOLLY HAD RAISED HIM TO HAVE A REAL GOLD WATCH WITH A CHAIN AND SEALS HILARY AS I WILL NOW TERM HIM
AND THIS THOUGHT FILLED HIS MIND WHEN HE HAPPENED TO WAKE EARLY ON THE MORNING AFTER THE MORNING AFTER ROBERT HAD WISHED TO BE BIGGER THAN THE BAKER'S BOY AND HAD BEEN IT THE DAY THAT LAY BETWEEN THESE TWO DAYS HAD BEEN OCCUPIED ENTIRELY BY GETTING THE GOVERNESS CART HOME FROM BENENHURST
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN CYRIL WENT ON IMPATIENTLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS
IT FELL TO JANE'S LOT TO WAKEN THE GROWN UP LAMB SHE DID IT GENTLY BY TICKLING HIS NOSE WITH A TWIG OF WILD HONEYSUCKLE HE SAID
LOOK HERE JANE SAID THE GROWN UP LAMB
RUN ALONG HOME LIKE GOOD CHILDREN THE POSITION WAS DESPERATE
OR HAD HIS MIND GROWN UP TOGETHER WITH HIS BODY THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH THE OTHERS IN A HURRIED COUNCIL HELD AMONG THE YELLOWING BRACKEN A FEW YARDS FROM THE SLEEPER DEBATED EAGERLY WHICHEVER IT IS IT'LL BE JUST AS AWFUL SAID ANTHEA IF HIS INSIDE SENSES ARE GROWN UP TOO
I WISH TO GOODNESS HE WOULD OH TAKE CARE CRIED ANTHEA IN AN AGONY OF APPREHENSION BUT IT WAS TOO LATE LIKE MUSIC TO A SONG HER WORDS AND CYRIL'S CAME OUT TOGETHER ANTHEA OH TAKE CARE CYRIL GROW UP NOW
THEIR BEDS SPEAKING GLANCES FLASHED BETWEEN THE WRETCHED FOUR MUCH BED THERE WOULD BE FOR THEM IF THEY WENT HOME WITHOUT THE LAMB WE PROMISED MOTHER NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF YOU IF WE TOOK YOU OUT
CHAPTER NINE GROWN UP CYRIL HAD ONCE POINTED OUT THAT ORDINARY LIFE IS FULL OF OCCASIONS ON WHICH A WISH WOULD BE MOST USEFUL
THEY ALL WISHED SO HARD INDEED THAT THEY FELT QUITE GIDDY AND ALMOST LOST CONSCIOUSNESS BUT THE WISHING WAS QUITE VAIN FOR WHEN THE WOOD CEASED TO WHIRL ROUND THEIR DAZZLED EYES WERE RIVETED AT ONCE BY THE SPECTACLE OF A VERY PROPER LOOKING YOUNG MAN IN FLANNELS AND A STRAW HAT
A PUNCTURE HE WAS SAYING CAN I NOT BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU COULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A STIFLED EXPLOSION OF LAUGHTER BEHIND THE PIG PAIL THE GROWN UP LAMB OTHERWISE DEVEREUX TURNED THE TAIL OF AN ANGRY EYE IN ITS DIRECTION
BLANK MISERY FELL LIKE A PALL ON THE FOUR OTHERS THE LAMB
JANE DOUBTFULLY SUPPOSED SO NOW THE LAMB WHOM I MUST TRY TO REMEMBER TO CALL SAINT MAUR WAS EXAMINING THE LADY'S BICYCLE AND TALKING TO HER WITH A VERY GROWN UP MANNER INDEED NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE SUPPOSED TO SEE AND HEAR HIM
NOW DO BE PERSUADED FOR YOUR OWN GOOD ASK FOR A GOOD FAT MEGATHERIUM AND HAVE DONE WITH IT THANK YOU NOT TO DAY I THINK SAID CYRIL CAUTIOUSLY WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SAY WAS YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS WISHING FOR THINGS WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AT ANYTHING
YOU KNOW FATHER DIDN'T WISH YOU TO GO TO LONDON HE WOULDN'T LIKE US TO BE LEFT ALONE WITHOUT YOU TO TAKE CARE OF US OH DECEITFUL BEAST THAT I AM SHE ADDED TO HERSELF LOOK HERE SAID CYRIL IF YOU'RE OUR ELDER BROTHER
I SELDOM PLAY
ONE OF WHOSE NAMES WAS DEVEREUX SAYING ME LOVE PANTY WANTS TO COME TO OWN PANTY OH LET'S GET HOME FOR GOODNESS SAKE SHE SAID YOU SHALL SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE IN THE MORNING IF YOU CAN SHE ADDED IN A WHISPER
AND WHEN EVEN IMMERSION IN A WASH HAND BASIN HAD FAILED TO WASH THE MOULD FROM THE WORKS AND MAKE THE WATCH GO AGAIN CYRIL HAD SAID SEVERAL THINGS IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT BUT NOW HE WAS CALMER AND HAD EVEN CONSENTED TO CARRY THE LAMB PART OF THE WAY TO THE WOODS
SO THE MACHINE WAS WHEELED THE SUN WAS JUST ON THE POINT OF SETTING WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE WHITE HOUSE THE FOUR ELDER CHILDREN WOULD HAVE LIKED TO LINGER IN THE LANE TILL THE COMPLETE SUNSETTING TURNED THE GROWN UP LAMB WHOSE CHRISTIAN NAMES I WILL NOT FURTHER WEARY YOU BY REPEATING
SOMETIMES CALLED SAINT MAUR IN THESE PAGES I DON'T KNOW HE LIED MISERABLY
WHICH WARNED HIM OF THE APPROACH OF THE OTHERS
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUDDENLY SEE A POOR LITTLE HELPLESS BABY SPINNING ALONG DOWNHILL BESIDE YOU WITH ITS FEET UP ON A BICYCLE IT HAD LOST CONTROL OF THE LADY HAD TURNED RATHER PALE WHO ARE THESE VERY DIRTY CHILDREN SHE ASKED THE GROWN UP LAMB
THE AWFUL THING TO DAY WAS HIS GROWING UP SO SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO TIME TO IMPROVE HIM AT ALL HE DOESN'T WANT ANY IMPROVING SAID ANTHEA AS THE VOICE OF THE LAMB CAME COOING THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR JUST AS SHE HAD HEARD IT IN HER HEART THAT AFTERNOON
WHAT'S THE GIDDY HOUR YOU'LL BE LATE FOR YOUR GRUB I KNOW WE SHALL SAID ROBERT BITTERLY THEN CUT ALONG HOME SAID THE GROWN UP LAMB WHAT ABOUT YOUR GRUB THOUGH ASKED JANE
THERE ARE GENTLEMEN OF VERY GOOD BLOOD AND FASHION IN THIS CITY WHO NEVER HAVE ENTERED A LADY'S DRAWING ROOM SO THAT THOUGH RAWDON CRAWLEY'S MARRIAGE MIGHT BE TALKED ABOUT IN HIS COUNTY WHERE OF COURSE MISSUS BUTE HAD SPREAD THE NEWS IN LONDON IT WAS DOUBTED OR NOT HEEDED
AS I MAY SAY WORDSWORTH WAS POET ONE AND DAVY WAS POET TWO THAT WAS TRUE IN EVERY SENSE YOU KNOW DOROTHEA FELT A LITTLE MORE UNEASY THAN USUAL
THE AROMA IS MIXED WITH THE GROSSER AIR WE MUST KEEP THE GERMINATING GRAIN AWAY FROM THE LIGHT DOROTHEA COLORED WITH PLEASURE AND LOOKED UP GRATEFULLY TO THE SPEAKER
WAS EVIDENTLY AND QUICKLY SMITTEN BY MISSUS CRAWLEY BUT HER OWN CIRCUMSPECTION AND MODESTY NEVER FORSOOK HER FOR A MOMENT AND CRAWLEY'S REPUTATION AS A FIRE EATING AND JEALOUS WARRIOR WAS A FURTHER AND COMPLETE DEFENCE TO HIS LITTLE WIFE
I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME SEND OVER A CHESTNUT HORSE FOR YOU TO TRY IT HAS BEEN TRAINED FOR A LADY I SAW YOU ON SATURDAY CANTERING OVER THE HILL ON A NAG NOT WORTHY OF YOU MY GROOM SHALL BRING CORYDON FOR YOU EVERY DAY
IT IS NOT OUR PURPOSE TO MAKE MENTION
WHEN HE STAYED AT HOME SHE PLAYED AND SANG FOR HIM MADE HIM GOOD DRINKS SUPERINTENDED HIS DINNER WARMED HIS SLIPPERS AND STEEPED HIS SOUL IN COMFORT THE BEST OF WOMEN I HAVE HEARD MY GRANDMOTHER SAY ARE HYPOCRITES
RECOLLECTING IT IN OLD DAYS WHEN SHE USED TO PLAY UPON IT IN THE LITTLE SITTING ROOM OF OUR DEAR AMELIA SEDLEY THE SALE WAS AT THE OLD HOUSE IN RUSSELL SQUARE
WHO REWARDED HIM WITH A KISS BY WAY OF REPLY AND WAS INDEED NOT A LITTLE GRATIFIED BY THE GENEROUS CONFIDENCE OF HER HUSBAND
THE AUCTIONEER SAID MISTER LEWIS TWENTY FIVE AND MISTER LEWIS'S CHIEF THUS BECAME THE PROPRIETOR OF THE LITTLE SQUARE PIANO HAVING EFFECTED THE PURCHASE HE SATE UP AS IF HE WAS GREATLY RELIEVED AND THE UNSUCCESSFUL COMPETITORS CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF HIM AT THIS MOMENT
RANSACKED BY BROKERS AND BARGAINERS AND ITS QUIET FAMILY TREASURES GIVEN UP TO PUBLIC DESECRATION AND PLUNDER A MONTH AFTER HER FLIGHT
MISTER CASAUBON HAD COME UP TO THE TABLE TEACUP IN HAND AND WAS LISTENING WE MUST NOT INQUIRE TOO CURIOUSLY INTO MOTIVES HE INTERPOSED IN HIS MEASURED WAY
I THINK IT WOULD DO CELIA GOOD
OLD WOMEN AND AMATEURS HAVE INVADED THE UPPER APARTMENTS PINCHING THE BED CURTAINS POKING INTO THE FEATHERS SHAMPOOING THE MATTRESSES AND CLAPPING THE WARDROBE DRAWERS TO AND FRO
SENT THIS LITTLE SPAR OUT OF THE WRECK WITH THEIR LOVE TO GOOD MISSUS SEDLEY AND WITH RESPECT TO THE PIANO AS IT HAD BEEN AMELIA'S AND AS SHE MIGHT MISS IT AND WANT ONE NOW AND AS CAPTAIN WILLIAM DOBBIN COULD NO MORE PLAY UPON IT THAN HE COULD DANCE ON THE TIGHT ROPE
AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE BLOOMING ENGLISHMAN OF THE RED WHISKERED TYPE REPRESENTED BY SIR JAMES CHETTAM I AM READING THE AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY SAID THIS EXCELLENT BARONET
AS POTIPHAR WAS ONLY IN A DIFFERENT WAY BY THESE ATTENTIONS THAT VETERAN RAKE
HERE WAS A MAN WHO COULD UNDERSTAND THE HIGHER INWARD LIFE AND WITH WHOM THERE COULD BE SOME SPIRITUAL COMMUNION NAY
NO INDEED NOT EXACTLY
PRETTY THING IS IT NOT SWEET MINIATURE
THAT NEVER EXPLAINED SCIENCE WHICH WAS THRUST AS AN EXTINGUISHER OVER ALL HER LIGHTS BUT YOU ARE FOND OF RIDING MISS BROOKE SIR JAMES PRESENTLY TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD ENTER A LITTLE INTO THE PLEASURES OF HUNTING
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY HIDE FROM US HOW WATCHFUL THEY ARE WHEN THEY SEEM MOST ARTLESS AND CONFIDENTIAL HOW OFTEN THOSE FRANK SMILES WHICH THEY WEAR SO EASILY ARE TRAPS TO CAJOLE OR ELUDE OR DISARM
MISTER CASAUBON TURNED HIS EYES VERY MARKEDLY ON DOROTHEA WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING AND SEEMED TO OBSERVE HER NEWLY
WAS THE MORE CONSPICUOUS FROM ITS CONTRAST WITH GOOD MISTER BROOKE'S SCRAPPY SLOVENLINESS
BUT NOT TOO HARD I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN FAVOR OF A LITTLE THEORY WE MUST HAVE THOUGHT ELSE WE SHALL BE LANDED BACK IN THE DARK AGES BUT TALKING OF BOOKS THERE IS SOUTHEY'S PENINSULAR WAR
AND THE IRISH WIDOW CONSOLED AND FLATTERED HIM AS USUAL HIS PRESENT OF MONEY NEEDFUL AS IT WAS MADE LITTLE IMPRESSION ON HIS PARENTS
WHEN SHE WANTED TO GIVE IT ALL TO MISTER CASAUBON NO THAT IS TOO HARD SAID SIR JAMES IN A TONE OF REPROACH THAT SHOWED STRONG INTEREST YOUR SISTER IS GIVEN TO SELF MORTIFICATION IS SHE NOT HE CONTINUED
AFTER THE FAILURE WAS ON THE RECEIPT OF THE PACKET OF FORKS AND SPOONS WITH THE YOUNG STOCKBROKERS LOVE OVER WHICH HE BURST OUT CRYING LIKE A CHILD BEING GREATLY MORE AFFECTED THAN EVEN HIS WIFE TO WHOM THE PRESENT WAS ADDRESSED EDWARD DALE
AND ONE DOZEN DESSERT DITTO DITTO THERE WERE THREE YOUNG STOCKBROKERS MESSRS DALE SPIGGOT AND DALE OF THREADNEEDLE STREET INDEED WHO HAVING HAD DEALINGS WITH THE OLD MAN
MY LORD DIVES'S REMAINS ARE IN THE FAMILY VAULT THE STATUARIES ARE CUTTING AN INSCRIPTION VERACIOUSLY COMMEMORATING HIS VIRTUES AND THE SORROWS OF HIS HEIR WHO IS DISPOSING OF HIS GOODS
LET ME HOPE THAT YOU WILL RESCIND THAT RESOLUTION ABOUT THE HORSE MISS BROOKE SAID THE PERSEVERING ADMIRER I ASSURE YOU RIDING IS THE MOST HEALTHY OF EXERCISES I AM AWARE OF IT SAID DOROTHEA COLDLY
WHAT AN ARTFUL LITTLE WOMAN EJACULATED REBECCA WELL I DON'T REGRET IT IF YOU DON'T THE CAPTAIN CRIED
WHO COULD ILLUMINATE PRINCIPLE WITH THE WIDEST KNOWLEDGE A MAN WHOSE LEARNING ALMOST AMOUNTED TO A PROOF OF WHATEVER HE BELIEVED DOROTHEA'S INFERENCES MAY SEEM LARGE
IS NOTHING BUT A MAN ON A GRAY ASS LIKE MY OWN WHO CARRIES SOMETHING SHINY ON HIS HEAD JUST SO ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE AND THAT RESPLENDENT OBJECT IS THE HELMET OF MAMBRINO
BLOOD HAD SAILED IN TO OPEN FIRE UPON THE SALVADOR FIRST ATHWART HER HAWSE HE HAD LOOSED A BROADSIDE THAT HAD SWEPT HER DECKS WITH TERRIFIC EFFECT THEN GOING ON AND ABOUT
RESTING LIGHTLY ON THE PUMMEL CORRECTED THE IMPRESSION THAT AND THOSE STEELY EYES OF HIS ANNOUNCED THE ADVENTURER YOU FIND ME RIDICULOUS EH CAHUSAC SAID HE AS HE CAME TO A HALT
TROUBLE ME NO MORE HE SNAPPED AT CAHUSAC WHO CAME GROWLING TO HIM AGAIN SEND WORD TO DON MIGUEL
SO THAT THEY MIGHT LISTEN TO WHAT PASSED AMONG THEIR LEADERS CAHUSAC APPEARED TO BE HAVING IT ALL HIS OWN WAY AND HE RAISED HIS HARSH QUERULOUS VOICE SO THAT ALL MIGHT HEAR HIS TRUCULENT DENUNCIATION HE SPOKE
OF REDUCING YOUR FORT AT THE COST OF SOME LIVES I WARN YOU THAT YOU MAY EXPECT NO QUARTER FROM US AND THAT I SHALL BEGIN BY LEAVING A HEAP OF ASHES WHERE THIS PLEASANT CITY OF MARACAYBO NOW STANDS THE LETTER WRITTEN
WITH A SKILL OF WHICH HE MIGHT JUSTLY BE PROUD HAVING DESTROYED A FORCE SO SUPERIOR IN SHIPS AND GUNS AND MEN THAT DON MIGUEL DE ESPINOSA HAD JUSTIFIABLY DEEMED IT OVERWHELMING
IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THEY USED A VIGILANCE KEENER THAN THEIR CARELESS HABIT CERTAIN IT IS THAT THEY DID NOT SIGHT BLOOD'S FLEET IN THAT DIM LIGHT
THAT WAS THE MESSAGE HE RECEIVED FROM THEM THAT SAME EVENING BY THE SULLEN MOUTH OF CAHUSAC HIMSELF HE WELCOMED IT AND INVITED THE BRETON TO SIT DOWN AND JOIN THE COUNCIL WHICH WAS EVEN THEN DELIBERATING UPON THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED
SAILED INTO THE GREAT LAKE OF MARACAYBO AND EFFECTED ITS RAID UPON THAT OPULENT CITY OF THE MAIN THE AFFAIR DID NOT PROCEED EXACTLY AS WAS HOPED AND BLOOD'S FORCE CAME TO FIND ITSELF IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION
BY ANY BUT THE SHALLOWEST CRAFT SAVE AT ITS EASTERN END WHERE COMPLETELY COMMANDING THE NARROW PASSAGE OUT TO SEA STANDS THE MASSIVE FORT WHICH THE BUCCANEERS HAD FOUND DESERTED UPON THEIR COMING IN THE BROADER WATER BETWEEN THIS PASSAGE AND THE BAR
BUT SINCE YE'RE SO DESPERATELY CONCERNED TO SAVE YOUR SKIN YOU AND THOSE THAT THINK LIKE YOU ARE WELCOME TO LEAVE US I'VE NO DOUBT AT ALL THE SPANISH ADMIRAL WILL WELCOME THE ABATEMENT OF OUR NUMBERS
TURBAN WISE ABOUT HIS HEAD IS IT THAT I HAVE NOT WARNED YOU FROM THE BEGINNING THAT ALL WAS TOO EASY HE DEMANDED BETWEEN PLAINTIVENESS AND FURY I AM NO FOOL MY FRIENDS
THUS LIGHTENED AND LISTING NOW TO STARBOARD HE FETCHED HER ABOUT
WHAT DO WE FIND A CITY ABANDONED LIKE THE FORT A CITY OUT OF WHICH
LEAVING THE OTHERS TO DELIBERATE IN PEACE NEXT MORNING EARLY HE SOUGHT CAPTAIN BLOOD AGAIN HE FOUND HIM ALONE IN THE PATIO PACING TO AND FRO HIS HEAD SUNK ON HIS BREAST CAHUSAC
THE NEAREST GAPING SCUTTLE INTO THE HOLD AND THEREUPON DIVED OVERBOARD IN HIS TURN TO BE PICKED UP PRESENTLY BY THE LONGBOAT FROM THE ARABELLA BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENED THE SLOOP WAS A THING OF FIRE FROM WHICH EXPLOSIONS WERE HURLING BLAZING COMBUSTIBLES
THE STERN CHASERS OF THE SALVADOR DESULTORILY
HIS SIX MEN STOOD AT THEIR POSTS ON THE LARBOARD SIDE STARK NAKED EACH ARMED WITH A GRAPNEL FOUR OF THEM ON THE GUNWALE TWO OF THEM ALOFT AT THE MOMENT OF IMPACT THESE GRAPNELS WERE SLUNG TO BIND THE SPANIARD TO THEM
THIS IS BEST EXPLAINED IN THE WORDS EMPLOYED BY CAHUSAC WHICH PITT HAS CAREFULLY RECORDED IN THE COURSE OF AN ALTERCATION THAT BROKE OUT
WHO THOUGH STILL YOUNG HAD ALREADY WON FAME AS A PRIVATEER COMMANDER BEFORE THE LOSS OF HIS OWN SHIP HAD DRIVEN HIM TO TAKE SERVICE UNDER BLOOD THE CAPTAIN ADVANCED TOWARDS THAT DISPUTING GROUP
THAT STIRRED THROUGH THE PURPLE DARKNESS OF THE TROPICAL NIGHT
IN A SPACIOUS AND LUXURIANT GARDEN TO THE EAST OF CAYONA THE CAPTAIN BECAME A VERY WELCOME GUEST
I AM LOOKING AT IT SAID CAHUSAC PISH
AND TWO SLOOPS CAPTURED AT GIBRALTAR WHICH THEY HAD INDIFFERENTLY ARMED WITH FOUR CULVERINS EACH
AND SO SWIFT AND PARALYZING HAD BEEN BLOOD'S STROKE BOARDED NOW AND FACED BY THE COLD STEEL OF THE BUCCANEERS
EMOTIONS WHICH WILL RENDER UNREASONABLE THE MOST REASONABLE OF MEN WITH RETURNING CALM HE SURVEYED THE SITUATION
AGAIN I WARN CAPTAIN BLOOD IT IS A TRAP I SAY WE ARE TO COME ON ALWAYS TO COME ON WITHOUT OPPOSITION UNTIL WE FIND THAT IT IS TOO LATE TO GO TO SEA AGAIN THAT WE CANNOT GO BACK AT ALL
HIS VICTORY WAS RENDERED BARREN BY THREE LUCKY SHOTS FROM AN UNSUSPECTED BATTERY BY WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND BARREN MUST THEIR VICTORY REMAIN UNTIL THEY COULD REDUCE THE FORT THAT STILL REMAINED TO DEFEND THE PASSAGE
THE BUCCANEERS LABOURED AND SWEATED TO COMPLETE THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE ACTION THAT WAS TO PROCURE THEM THEIR DELIVERANCE TIME PRESSED THEY MUST STRIKE BEFORE DON MIGUEL DE ESPINOSA
THE ADMIRAL GOT HIS CREW ASHORE ON PALOMAS AS BEST HE COULD AND THEN JUST AS CAPTAIN BLOOD ACCOUNTED THE VICTORY WON AND THAT HIS WAY OUT OF THAT TRAP TO THE OPEN SEA BEYOND LAY CLEAR THE FORT SUDDENLY REVEALED ITS FORMIDABLE
THE LATTER RATHER SINCE HIS ELEGANT SUIT OF VIOLET TAFFETAS WITH GOLD EMBROIDERED BUTTON HOLES WAS IN THE SPANISH FASHION BUT THE LONG STOUT SERVICEABLE RAPIER THRUST UP BEHIND BY THE LEFT HAND
THE FOUR SPANISH SHIPS WERE AT ANCHOR IN MID CHANNEL THE ADMIRAL'S ENCARNACION WHICH WE ALREADY KNOW WAS A MIGHTY GALLEON OF FORTY EIGHT GREAT GUNS AND EIGHT SMALL NEXT IN IMPORTANCE WAS THE SALVADOR WITH THIRTY SIX GUNS
WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD HAD APPROPRIATED TO HIS OWN USES A CLOISTERED STONE QUADRANGLE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH A FOUNTAIN PLAYED COOLLY UNDER A TRELLIS OF VINE ORANGE TREES GREW ON TWO SIDES OF IT
IN UPON THE DEAD HE WATCHED ALL THAT WAS DONE THE MEN EMPLOYED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES INSTRUCTED OVER NIGHT HAD FENCED IN THE GRAVE WITH CANVAS THE PROCEEDINGS WERE ACCORDINGLY CONDUCTED IN STRICT PRIVACY A MAN WAS POSTED TO KEEP AWAY
IT WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ANY SURPRISE TO ME TO HEAR DEFINITELY I MEAN YOUNG GENTLEMEN THAT ALL THIS MONEY THAT WAS IN QUESTION WENT INTO CHAMBERLAYNE'S POCKETS
EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS QUIET AS THE DEAD FOLK WHO LAY BENEATH THEIR FEET
A QUANTITY OF PAPERS RELATING TO CLOUDHAMPTON AND THE HEARTH AND HOME MUTUAL BENEFIT SOCIETY WERE REVEALED HE GAVE A HASTY GLANCE AT THESE AND DREW BRETON ASIDE
THE MEN GATHERED ROUND CRANED THEIR NECKS WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT SAWDUST THE COFFIN WAS PACKED TO THE BRIM WITH SAWDUST TIGHTLY PRESSED DOWN THE SURFACE LAY SMOOTH UNDISTURBED LEVELLED AS SOME HAND HAD LEVELLED IT LONG YEARS BEFORE
LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE COFFIN
AND THE ISSUES WERE TREMENDOUS NOW FOR IT SAID THE WATCHMAN'S SOLICITOR IN AN UNDERTONE
BE ABLE TO PUT OUR HANDS ON THE MAN WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN IT YOU THINK MY FATHER WAS WORKED UPON BY THIS MAN CHAMBERLAYNE SIR OBSERVED BRETON A FEW MINUTES LATER WHEN THEY HAD ALL SAT DOWN ROUND MISTER QUARTERPAGE'S HOSPITABLE HEARTH
A DREADFUL THING IF THERE IS A DEAD MAN THERE SAID SPARGO
NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM BUT THAT THE TWO SHOULD GO IN HIS FAMILY HE SAID HAD JUST RETIRED BUT HE HIMSELF WAS GOING TO TAKE A FINAL NIGHTCAP AND A CIGAR AND THEY MUST SHARE IT FOR A FEW MINUTES ONLY THEN MISTER QUARTERPAGE SAID SPARGO AS THEY FOLLOWED THE OLD MAN INTO HIS DINING ROOM
BUT WELL TO YOUR POOR FATHER HE WAS LED AWAY SIR LED AWAY BY CHAMBERLAYNE GOD BLESS ME WHAT A NIGHT OF SURPRISES WHY MISTER SPARGO SUPPOSING THAT COFFIN IS FOUND EMPTY WHAT THEN THEN ANSWERED SPARGO THEN I THINK WE SHALL
IT STRIKES ME WE'VE FOUND A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN WE EVER BARGAINED FOR HE EXCLAIMED DIDN'T AYLMORE SAY THAT THE REAL CULPRIT AT CLOUDHAMPTON WAS ANOTHER MAN HIS CLERK OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT HE DID AGREED BRETON HE INSISTS ON IT THEN THIS FELLOW CHAMBERLAYNE MUST HAVE BEEN THE MAN SAID SPARGO HE CAME TO MARKET MILCASTER FROM THE NORTH
WORKED THEM OUT IT SEEMED TO SPARGO THAT EACH MAN GREW SLOWER AND SLOWER IN HIS MOVEMENTS HE FELT THAT HE HIMSELF WAS GETTING FIDGETY THEN HE HEARD A VOICE OF AUTHORITY LIFT THE LID OFF A MAN AT THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN A MAN AT THE FOOT SUDDENLY AND SWIFTLY RAISED THE LID
WHAT IS IT WE SHALL KNOW IF IF WHAT SAID BRETON IF WHAT BUT SPARGO SHOOK HIS HEAD
THE OFFICIALS IN CHARGE OF IT HAVE COME DOWN IN THE SAME TRAIN WITH US WE'RE ALL STAYING ACROSS THERE AT THE DRAGON THE OFFICIALS HAVE GONE TO MAKE THE PROPER ARRANGEMENTS WITH YOUR AUTHORITIES
A GREAT DEAL YOU SAID IF WE FOUND THAT COFFIN EMPTY IT IS EMPTY COME ON QUICK ALL RIGHT I BELIEVE I KNOW WHERE ELPHICK AND CARDLESTONE CAN BE FOUND THAT'S ALL ALL IT'S ENOUGH
SPARGO CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF NAMES THAT WERE FAMILIAR TO HIM MISTER QUARTERPAGE'S AMONGST THEM
HIM WITH A SMILE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE GOOD GROUNDS FOR SUSPICION HE REMARKED HERE IS NO DEAD BODY GENTLEMEN SEE IF ANYTHING LIES BENEATH THE SAWDUST HE ADDED TURNING TO THE WORKMEN TURN IT OUT THE WORKMEN BEGAN TO SCOOP OUT THE SAWDUST WITH THEIR HANDS
WHAT THEY MAY REVEAL YOU DON'T INDEED SAID SPARGO BUT I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU THAT I HAVE A STRONG BELIEF THAT THEY'LL REVEAL A GOOD DEAL THAT NOBODY DREAMS OF SO TAKE THE GREATEST CARE OF THEM THEN WITHOUT WAITING FOR FURTHER TALK WITH ANY ONE SPARGO HURRIED BRETON OUT OF THE CEMETERY AT THE GATE HE SEIZED HIM BY THE ARM
DONE IT CLEVERLY HE REMARKED LOOKING ROUND YOU SEE HOW THESE WEIGHTS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED WHEN A BODY'S LAID OUT IN A COFFIN YOU KNOW ALL THE WEIGHT'S IN THE END WHERE THE HEAD AND TRUNK REST HERE YOU SEE THE HEAVIEST BAR OF LEAD IS IN THE MIDDLE THE LIGHTEST AT THE FEET CLEVER
MARKET MILCASTER AND THE SEA WAS WHITE WITH FOG
IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN THEY REACHED THE LITTLE TOWN BUT SPARGO HAVING LOOKED IN AT THE PARLOUR OF THE YELLOW DRAGON AND ASCERTAINED THAT MISTER QUARTERPAGE HAD ONLY JUST GONE HOME TOOK BRETON ACROSS THE STREET
WE HAVE TO BE UP AT DAYBREAK AND POSSIBLY YOU TOO WOULD LIKE TO BE UP JUST AS EARLY MISTER QUARTERPAGE LOOKED AN ENQUIRY OVER THE TOP OF A DECANTER WHICH HE WAS HANDLING AT DAYBREAK HE EXCLAIMED THE FACT IS SAID SPARGO THAT GRAVE OF CHAMBERLAYNE'S IS GOING TO BE OPENED AT DAYBREAK
ONE OF THEM EVIDENTLY DESIROUS OF MAKING SURE THAT NO BODY WAS IN THE COFFIN THRUST DOWN HIS FINGERS AT VARIOUS PLACES ALONG ITS LENGTH HE TOO LAUGHED THE COFFIN'S WEIGHTED WITH LEAD HE REMARKED SEE AND TEARING THE SAWDUST ASIDE HE SHOWED THOSE AROUND HIM THAT
AT FIRST THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT AND SPARGO OCCUPIED HIMSELF BY REFLECTING THAT EVERY SPADEFUL OF EARTH THROWN OUT OF THAT GRAVE WAS BRINGING HIM NEARER TO THE TRUTH HE HAD AN UNCONQUERABLE INTUITION THAT THE TRUTH
CHAMBERLAYNE MY DEAR YOUNG SIR HE ANSWERED
AND YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT CHAMBERLAYNE IS ACTUALLY ALIVE MISTER SPARGO SPARGO PULLED OUT HIS WATCH WE SHALL ALL KNOW WHETHER HE WAS BURIED IN THAT GRAVE BEFORE ANOTHER SIX HOURS ARE OVER MISTER QUARTERPAGE HE SAID HE MIGHT WELL HAVE SPOKEN OF FOUR HOURS INSTEAD OF SIX FOR IT WAS
RIGHT AWAY UP IN ONE OF THE WILDEST PARTS OF THE YORKSHIRE MOORS I EXPECT THEY'VE GONE THERE NOBODY KNOWS EVEN THEIR NAMES THERE
AND THAT THE BODY OF THE STOCKBROKER CHAMBERLAYNE THEN A GOOD DEAL OF HIS SPARGO'S LATEST THEORY WOULD BE DISSOLVED TO NOTHINGNESS BUT IF THAT COFFIN CONTAINED NO BODY AT ALL THEN THEY'RE DOWN TO IT WHISPERED BRETON PRESENTLY THEY ALL WENT AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE GRAVE
THEY COULD ALL READ THE LETTERING ON IT JAMES CARTWRIGHT CHAMBERLAYNE BORN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO DIED EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE SPARGO TURNED AWAY AS THE MEN BEGAN TO LIFT THE COFFIN OUT OF THE GRAVE WE SHALL KNOW NOW HE WHISPERED TO BRETON AND YET
NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM UNTIL HE CAME TO THIS TOWN AND YET BEFORE HE HAD BEEN HERE VERY LONG HE HAD CONTRIVED TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH EVERYBODY OF COURSE TO HIS OWN ADVANTAGE
ONE OF THEM WAS BRUSHING THE EARTH AWAY FROM THE NAME PLATE
AND I SUPPOSE NOW THAT YOU KNOW OF IT YOU'LL BE THERE GOD BLESS ME EXCLAIMED MISTER QUARTERPAGE YOU'VE REALLY DONE THAT WELL WELL SO WE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AT LAST AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
FORCED HIS WAY TO WHERE THE OFFICIALS FROM THE HOME OFFICE AND THE SOLICITOR SENT BY THE WATCHMAN WERE HASTILY EXAMINING THEIR DISCOVERIES THE FIRST BUNDLE OF PAPERS OPENED EVIDENTLY RELATED TO TRANSACTIONS AT MARKET MILCASTER
DECANTER AND GLASS AND HASTENED TO GIVE BRETON HIS HAND MY DEAR YOUNG SIR HE EXCLAIMED THAT I WILL INDEED AND AS TO WISHING YOU WELL
ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE CONTESTANTS
PRESENTLY WE COMMENCED THE DESCENT OF A VERY STEEP INCLINE IT WILL NOT BE LONG HE SAID BEFORE WE SHALL HAVE LIGHT AT THE LOWER LEVELS WE MEET THE SAME STRATUM OF PHOSPHORESCENT ROCK THAT ILLUMINATES OMEAN
I SOON SAW THAT THEY WOULD OVERTAKE ME UNLESS I FOUND A PLACE TO CONCEAL MYSELF UNTIL THEY HAD PASSED WHICH WOULD THEN GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN THE WAY I HAD COME AND REGAIN THE TOWER OR POSSIBLY FIND A WAY TO REACH THE CITY STREETS
AND A MOMENT LATER MY ARMS AND LEGS SECURELY BOUND SO QUICKLY HAD THEY WORKED AND TO SUCH GOOD PURPOSE THAT I WAS UTTERLY BEYOND THE POWER TO RESIST THEM BY THE TIME I WAS FULLY AWAKE NEVER A WORD SPOKE THEY AND THE GAG EFFECTUALLY PREVENTED ME SPEAKING
IT WOULD BE WEARISOME TO NARRATE THE DETAILS OF THAT BLOODY STRUGGLE OF HOW WE FOUGHT FROM THE DOORWAY THE FULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM TO THE VERY FOOT OF THE THRONE BEFORE THE LAST OF MY ANTAGONISTS FELL WITH MY BLADE PIERCING HIS HEART AND THEN WITH A GLAD CRY
WHEN HOWEVER I SAW THE VILE HAND OF SALENSUS OLL REACH OUT FOR THE HAND OF MY BELOVED PRINCESS I COULD RESTRAIN MYSELF NO LONGER AND BEFORE THE NOBLES OF OKAR KNEW THAT AUGHT HAD HAPPENED
AND NOTED THAT THE SOUND OF THE BATTLE ANTHEM HAD CEASED WAS DEJAH THORIS PREPARING TO TAKE HER PLACE BESIDE ME HEROIC DAUGHTER OF A HEROIC WORLD IT WOULD NOT BE UNLIKE HER TO HAVE SEIZED A SWORD AND FOUGHT AT MY SIDE
OF HELIUM ARE PERMITTED TO CHOOSE FAIRLY THEIR NEXT JEDDAK WHOM THEY CHOOSE MAY COUNT UPON THE LOYALTY OF MY SWORD NOR SHALL I SEEK THE HONOUR FOR MYSELF UNTIL THEN TARDOS MORS IS JEDDAK OF HELIUM
THE FORMER AGREED TO TAKE SUCH VESSELS AS WE REQUIRED INTO DOCK AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE
OF THE DEAD SEA BOTTOMS THAT HAD DRIVEN THEM STEP BY STEP TO THE UTTERMOST PINNACLE OF THE WORLD WHERE THEY WERE NOW INTRENCHED BEHIND AN IMPENETRABLE BARRIER OF SUPERSTITION IN ADDITION TO THE GREEN MEN THERE HAD BEEN THREE PRINCIPAL RACES UPON BARSOOM
NEVER SHALL I FORGET THAT TRIP THROUGH THE PITS OF ISSUS WHILE IT WAS DEVOID OF IMPORTANT INCIDENTS YET IT WAS FILLED FOR ME WITH A STRANGE CHARM OF EXCITEMENT AND ADVENTURE
I TURNED WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS TO SEIZE MY PRINCESS AND AS MY LIPS SMOTHERED HERS TO REAP THE REWARD THAT WOULD BE THRICE AMPLE PAYMENT FOR THE BLOODY ENCOUNTERS THROUGH WHICH I HAD PASSED FOR HER DEAR SAKE FROM THE SOUTH POLE TO THE NORTH
IF SUCH A THING WERE POSSIBLE
WILL YOU TAKE OATH TO PROSECUTE THE SEARCH FOR HER AND BRING HER BACK IN SAFETY TO HER GRANDFATHER'S COURT UPON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD EACH OF THEM SWORE TO DO AS I HAD ASKED IT WAS AGREED THAT THE BATTLESHIPS THAT WERE TO BE REMODELLED SHOULD BE ORDERED TO HASTOR
KANTOS KAN HE WAS LEADING THE LITTLE PARTY THAT HAD WON ITS WAY INTO THE VERY HEART OF THE PALACE OF SALENSUS OLL IN AN INSTANT I SAW THAT BY ATTACKING THE OKARIANS FROM THE REAR I COULD SO QUICKLY DISORGANIZE THEM THAT THEIR FURTHER RESISTANCE WOULD BE SHORT LIVED
THE VARIOUS RACES HAD MADE WAR UPON ONE ANOTHER FOR AGES AND THE THREE HIGHER TYPES HAD EASILY BESTED THE GREEN SAVAGES OF THE WATER PLACES OF THE WORLD BUT NOW THAT THE RECEDING SEAS NECESSITATED CONSTANT ABANDONMENT OF THEIR FORTIFIED CITIES
FESTERING IN ITS ROTTENNESS BY YOUR SIDE UNTIL CRAZED BY LONELINESS AND HUNGER YOU FEED UPON THE CRAWLING MAGGOTS THAT WERE ONCE A MAN THAT WAS ALL IN ANOTHER INSTANT SHE WAS GONE AND THE DIM LIGHT WHICH HAD FILLED THE CELL
AND I THINK ONCE OUT THAT WE SHALL FIND NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ARMING OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN A COUNTRY WHICH ABOUNDS SO PLENTIFULLY IN ARMED MEN AS YOU SAY HE REPLIED WITH A SMILE AND SHRUG
FROM SCRAPS OF CONVERSATION WHICH WE OVERHEARD IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BLACK PIRATES WERE SEARCHING FOR A PARTY OF FUGITIVES THAT HAD ESCAPED THEM SEVERAL DAYS PRIOR
THROUGH THE HEAVY BARS OF A GRATED DOOR AT ONE SIDE OF THE CHAMBER RASH MORTAL SHE SHRILLED YOU SHALL PAY THE AWFUL PENALTY FOR YOUR BLASPHEMY IN THIS SECRET CELL HERE YOU SHALL LIE ALONE AND IN DARKNESS WITH THE CARCASS OF YOUR ACCOMPLICE
WE WERE NOW IN A QUANDARY AS TO HOW TO PASS THE GUARDS WHO PATROLLED THE ISLAND ABOUT THE POOL AT LAST I HIT UPON A PLAN
CHAINED THOUGH SHE WAS STILL HAD SHE FOUGHT AGAINST THE THING THAT THEY WOULD DO TO HER AT SIGHT OF HER SALENSUS OLL ROSE AND DREW HIS SWORD
IT WAS THE VERY BOLDNESS OF THE PLAN WHICH RENDERED IT SUCCESSFUL WERE YOU CONNECTED WITH THE RISING OF THE SLAVES ASKED TORITH WE HAVE JUST HAD MEAGRE REPORTS OF SOME SUCH EVENT ALL WERE INVOLVED I REPLIED BUT IT AMOUNTED TO LITTLE
UPON WHICH STOOD SALENSUS OLL AWAITING HIS BRIDE NOW THE GUARDSMEN WERE FORCING THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM UP THE FEW STEPS TO THE SIDE OF THE TYRANT OF OKAR AND I HAD NO EYES AND NO THOUGHTS FOR AUGHT ELSE A PRIEST OPENED A BOOK AND RAISING HIS HAND
THAT ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO INSPIRE ME TO VICTORY OVER EVEN GREATER ODDS AND I VERILY BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BESTED THE ENTIRE ROOMFUL OF YELLOW WARRIORS THAT DAY IN THE NUPTIAL CHAMBER OF THE PALACE AT KADABRA HAD NOT INTERRUPTION COME TO MY AID
I WANTED THE MEN OF HELIUM TO SEE ME AND TO KNOW THAT THEIR BELOVED PRINCESS WAS HERE TOO FOR I KNEW THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE WOULD INSPIRE THEM TO EVEN GREATER DEEDS OF VALOR THAN THEY HAD PERFORMED IN THE PAST THOUGH GREAT INDEED MUST HAVE BEEN THOSE WHICH WON FOR THEM
BLACKNESS PLEASANT OLD LADY SAID A VOICE AT MY SIDE WHO SPEAKS I ASKED TIS I YOUR COMPANION WHO HAS HAD THE HONOUR THIS DAY OF FIGHTING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE GREATEST WARRIOR THAT EVER WORE METAL UPON BARSOOM
A LOOK OF FIERCE RAGE OVERSPREAD THE FEATURES OF MATAI SHANG AND A COLD AND CUNNING SMILE TOUCHED THE LIPS OF PHAIDOR THEN THEY WERE GONE BUT NOT BEFORE A TAUNTING LAUGH WAS THROWN DIRECTLY IN MY FACE BY THE WOMAN
AND I LONGED FOR THE MOMENT WHEN THE FIGHTING DONE I COULD FOLD HER IN MY ARMS AND HEAR ONCE MORE THE WORDS OF LOVE WHICH HAD BEEN DENIED ME FOR SO MANY YEARS DURING THE FIGHTING IN THE CHAMBER I HAD NOT EVEN A SINGLE CHANCE TO SO MUCH AS STEAL A GLANCE AT HER
AS EDNA SEATED HERSELF AT TABLE WITH THEM SHE THOUGHT
MISSUS ELEANOR BOLTONS HE PUSHED THE CARDS ASIDE MERCY EXCLAIMED EDNA WHO HAD BEEN FUMING
WHY HAD SHE NOT BEEN THERE BEFORE HOW WAS THAT DEAR MISTER PONTELLIER
A FRUIT VENDER WAS CRYING HIS WARES IN THE STREET
WHOM VICTOR CONSIDERED THAT HE HAD SOME SORT OF CLAIM UPON
SHE WENT UP IN THE MORNINGS TO MADAME LEBRUN'S ROOM
SHE WAS STILL UNDER THE SPELL OF HER INFATUATION SHE HAD TRIED TO FORGET HIM REALIZING THE INUTILITY OF REMEMBERING BUT THE THOUGHT OF HIM WAS LIKE AN OBSESSION EVER PRESSING ITSELF UPON HER
WHILE OTHERS ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE NATURAL AVERSION FOR WATER SOMETIMES BELIEVED TO ACCOMPANY THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT MADEMOISELLE OFFERED EDNA SOME CHOCOLATES IN A PAPER BAG WHICH SHE TOOK FROM HER POCKET BY WAY OF SHOWING THAT SHE BORE NO ILL FEELING
SHE FELT NO INTEREST IN ANYTHING ABOUT HER THE STREET THE CHILDREN THE FRUIT VENDER
EDNA TAPPED HER FOOT IMPATIENTLY AND WONDERED WHY THE CHILDREN PERSISTED IN PLAYING IN THE SUN WHEN THEY MIGHT BE UNDER THE TREES
RICH AND TASTEFUL DRAPERIES HUNG AT DOORS AND WINDOWS THERE WERE PAINTINGS SELECTED WITH JUDGMENT AND DISCRIMINATION UPON THE WALLS THE CUT GLASS THE SILVER THE HEAVY DAMASK
MISTER PONTELLIER WAS VERY FOND OF WALKING ABOUT HIS HOUSE EXAMINING ITS VARIOUS APPOINTMENTS AND DETAILS TO SEE THAT NOTHING WAS AMISS HE GREATLY VALUED HIS POSSESSIONS CHIEFLY BECAUSE THEY WERE HIS AND DERIVED GENUINE PLEASURE FROM CONTEMPLATING A PAINTING
DO YOU THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO TAKE IT UP AGAIN AND STUDY SOME MORE I MIGHT STUDY FOR A WHILE WITH LAIDPORE
WHERE HAD THEY MET ON CARONDELET STREET IN THE MORNING THEY HAD GONE IN AND HAD A DRINK AND A CIGAR TOGETHER
SIMPLE CHOICE AND IN EVERY WAY SATISFYING
MISTER PONTELLIER SCANNED THE NAMES OF HIS WIFE'S CALLERS READING SOME OF THEM ALOUD WITH COMMENTS AS HE READ
EXPRESSED REGRET THAT HE HAD GONE
MISTER PONTELLIER'S ARGUMENTS WERE USUALLY CONVINCING WITH THOSE
THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE WAS VERY HAPPY WITHOUT KNOWING WHY SHE WAS HAPPY TO BE ALIVE AND BREATHING WHEN HER WHOLE BEING SEEMED TO BE ONE WITH THE SUNLIGHT THE COLOR THE ODORS THE LUXURIANT WARMTH OF SOME PERFECT SOUTHERN DAY
ANTAGONISTIC SHE WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE SHE HAD THOUGHT OF SPEAKING TO THE COOK CONCERNING HER BLUNDERS OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
HIS MOTHER WOULD FIND IT IN HIS ROOM AMONG OTHER BOOKS THERE ON THE TABLE EDNA EXPERIENCED A PANG OF JEALOUSY BECAUSE HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS MOTHER RATHER THAN TO HER EVERY ONE SEEMED TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT SHE MISSED HIM
AND SHE'S MORE OF A MUSICIAN THAN YOU ARE A PAINTER SHE ISN'T A MUSICIAN AND I'M NOT A PAINTER
THAT HE HAD PACKED HIS TRUNK IN GOOD SHAPE THAT HE WAS WELL
WHICH SHE DISCOVERED BETWEEN ITS PAGES
AND KEEP THE BAREST PITTANCE FOR HIMSELF FAVORITE SON INDEED I MISS THE POOR FELLOW MYSELF MY DEAR
OWING TO ITS RAPIDITY AND INCOHERENCE WAS ALL BUT INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO EDNA WHATEVER IT WAS THE REBUKE WAS CONVINCING FOR THE WOMAN DROPPED HER HOE AND WENT MUMBLING INTO THE HOUSE
THAT WAS ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TWO LETTERS EDNA FELT THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN A MESSAGE FOR HER SHE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IT THE DESPONDENT FRAME OF MIND IN WHICH SHE HAD LEFT HOME BEGAN AGAIN TO OVERTAKE HER
THAT WERE SCATTERED UPON THE CARPET AND HERE'S YOUR RING MA'AM UNDER THE CHAIR EDNA HELD OUT HER HAND AND TAKING THE RING SLIPPED IT UPON HER FINGER
AND DISCOVERED IN SOME CORNER AN OLD FAMILY ALBUM
FINALLY SHE GATHERED TOGETHER A FEW OF THE SKETCHES
VALUELESS THAT SHE HERSELF HAD NOT ALONE DECIDED BUT DETERMINED BUT SHE SOUGHT THE WORDS OF PRAISE AND ENCOURAGEMENT THAT WOULD HELP HER TO PUT HEART INTO HER VENTURE YOUR TALENT IS IMMENSE DEAR NONSENSE PROTESTED EDNA WELL PLEASED
SHE MUST FEEL VERY LONELY WITHOUT HER SON SAID EDNA DESIRING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT HER FAVORITE SON TOO IT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE HARD TO LET HIM GO
ON A FEW PREVIOUS OCCASIONS SHE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY DEPRIVED OF ANY DESIRE TO FINISH HER DINNER SOMETIMES SHE HAD GONE INTO THE KITCHEN TO ADMINISTER A TARDY REBUKE TO THE COOK
WHEN MADAME LEBRUN COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS SO DULL COMING BACK TO THE CITY
HE WOULDN'T WANT HIS MOTHER TO KNOW AND HE BEGAN TO TALK IN A WHISPER HE WAS SCINTILLANT WITH RECOLLECTIONS OF COURSE HE COULDN'T THINK OF TELLING MISSUS PONTELLIER ALL ABOUT IT SHE BEING A WOMAN AND NOT COMPREHENDING SUCH THINGS
OR FOR ANY ONE THEN HAD FOLLOWED A RATHER HEATED ARGUMENT THE TWO WOMEN DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER OR TO BE TALKING THE SAME LANGUAGE
WHEN MISTER PONTELLIER BECAME RUDE EDNA GREW INSOLENT SHE HAD RESOLVED NEVER TO TAKE ANOTHER STEP BACKWARD
DID NOT GREATLY MISS HER YOUNG FRIEND OH GOOD MORNING MADEMOISELLE IS IT YOU
BUT OF COURSE THE PROSPECTS WERE VASTLY BETTER
I'M GOING TO GET MY DINNER AT THE CLUB GOOD NIGHT HE WENT INTO THE HALL TOOK HIS HAT AND STICK FROM THE STAND AND LEFT THE HOUSE SHE WAS SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH SUCH SCENES THEY HAD OFTEN MADE HER VERY UNHAPPY
THE WAY TO BECOME RICH IS TO MAKE MONEY MY DEAR EDNA NOT TO SAVE IT HE SAID
ALL THE MYSTERY AND WITCHERY OF THE NIGHT SEEMED TO HAVE GATHERED THERE AMID THE PERFUMES AND THE DUSKY AND TORTUOUS OUTLINES OF FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE SHE WAS SEEKING HERSELF AND FINDING HERSELF IN JUST SUCH SWEET HALF DARKNESS WHICH MET HER MOODS
SHE WAS UNUSUALLY PALE AND VERY QUIET
MISSUS PONTELLIER DID NOT KNOW HIM IF SHE SUPPOSED HE WAS ONE TO LET AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THAT ESCAPE HIM DESPITE HERSELF THE YOUNGSTER AMUSED HER SHE MUST HAVE BETRAYED IN HER LOOK SOME DEGREE OF INTEREST OR ENTERTAINMENT THE BOY GREW MORE DARING
SHE WORSHIPS HIM AND THE GROUND HE WALKS ON
THE LETTER WAS ON THE BOOKSHELF IT POSSESSED THE GREATEST INTEREST AND ATTRACTION FOR EDNA THE ENVELOPE ITS SIZE AND SHAPE THE POST MARK THE HANDWRITING SHE EXAMINED EVERY DETAIL OF THE OUTSIDE BEFORE OPENING IT
IN WHICH SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE THE TASTE OF LIFE'S DELIRIUM EDNA VAGUELY WONDERED WHAT SHE MEANT BY LIFE'S DELIRIUM
A MAID IN WHITE FLUTED CAP OFFERED THE CALLERS LIQUEUR COFFEE OR CHOCOLATE AS THEY MIGHT DESIRE
AND EVEN AT THE PRESENT DAY MANY OF HELLAS STILL FOLLOW THE OLD FASHION THE OZOLIAN
AGAIN THE EARLIEST SEA FIGHT IN HISTORY WAS BETWEEN THE CORINTHIANS AND CORCYRAEANS
BUT THE OLD TOWNS ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT PREVALENCE OF PIRACY WERE BUILT AWAY FROM THE SEA WHETHER ON THE ISLANDS OR THE CONTINENT AND STILL REMAIN IN THEIR OLD SITES FOR THE PIRATES USED TO PLUNDER ONE ANOTHER
EITHER IN WAR OR IN OTHER MATTERS FOR INSTANCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE COUNTRY NOW CALLED HELLAS HAD IN ANCIENT TIMES NO SETTLED POPULATION ON THE CONTRARY MIGRATIONS WERE OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE
OR OF ANY VIGOROUS ACTION OF THEIR OWN BUT AT LAST A TIME CAME WHEN THE TYRANTS OF ATHENS AND THE FAR OLDER TYRANNIES OF THE REST OF HELLAS WERE
AND THE FIRST PERSON KNOWN TO US BY TRADITION AS HAVING ESTABLISHED A NAVY IS MINOS HE MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF WHAT IS NOW CALLED THE HELLENIC SEA AND RULED OVER THE CYCLADES INTO MOST OF WHICH
THEY SEEM TO HAVE TURNED TO CULTIVATION OF THE CHERSONESE AND TO PIRACY FROM WANT OF SUPPLIES THIS WAS WHAT REALLY ENABLED THE TROJANS TO KEEP THE FIELD FOR TEN YEARS AGAINST THEM THE DISPERSION OF THE ENEMY MAKING THEM ALWAYS A MATCH FOR THE DETACHMENT LEFT BEHIND
AND INDEED ALL COAST POPULATIONS WHETHER SEAFARING OR NOT THE ISLANDERS TOO WERE GREAT PIRATES THESE ISLANDERS WERE CARIANS AND PHOENICIANS BY WHOM MOST OF THE ISLANDS WERE COLONIZED AS WAS PROVED BY THE FOLLOWING FACT
AGAINST ATHENS YOU PREFER TO ACT ON THE DEFENSIVE INSTEAD OF ON THE OFFENSIVE
AND TO THE HANDS OF HIS RELATION WHO HAD LEFT HIS FATHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF CHRYSIPPUS
A DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE SHE MAY FEEL FROM THE IDEA THAT YOUR BLUNTNESS OF PERCEPTION PREVENTS YOUR NOTICING HER BUT IT IS NOTHING TO THE IMPULSE WHICH HER ADVANCE WILL RECEIVE FROM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SEE BUT DO NOT CARE TO INTERFERE
AND IT WAS AT A SOMEWHAT LATER STAGE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT
AND THE CORINTHIAN TERRITORY WAS THE HIGHWAY THROUGH WHICH IT TRAVELLED SHE HAD CONSEQUENTLY GREAT MONEY RESOURCES AS IS SHOWN BY THE EPITHET WEALTHY BESTOWED BY THE OLD POETS ON THE PLACE AND THIS ENABLED HER WHEN TRAFFIC BY SEA BECAME MORE COMMON
HAVING NOW GIVEN THE RESULT OF MY INQUIRIES INTO EARLY TIMES I GRANT THAT THERE WILL BE A DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING EVERY PARTICULAR DETAIL THE WAY THAT MOST MEN DEAL WITH TRADITIONS EVEN TRADITIONS OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY
AND ENJOYED A FREEDOM FROM TYRANTS WHICH WAS UNBROKEN IT HAS POSSESSED THE SAME FORM OF GOVERNMENT FOR MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS RECKONING TO THE END OF THE LATE WAR AND HAS THUS BEEN IN A POSITION TO ARRANGE THE AFFAIRS OF THE OTHER STATES
AND THE MARKET OF ATHENS IN DEFIANCE OF THE TREATY LAST OF ALL THE CORINTHIANS CAME FORWARD AND HAVING LET THOSE WHO PRECEDED THEM INFLAME THE LACEDAEMONIANS NOW FOLLOWED WITH A SPEECH TO THIS EFFECT
OR WITH ITS OWN REVOLTED ALLIES AND CONSEQUENTLY AFFORDED THEM CONSTANT PRACTICE IN MILITARY MATTERS AND THAT EXPERIENCE WHICH IS LEARNT IN THE SCHOOL OF DANGER
THE ACARNANIANS AND THAT REGION OF THE CONTINENT AND THE CUSTOM OF CARRYING ARMS IS STILL KEPT UP AMONG THESE CONTINENTALS FROM THE OLD PIRATICAL HABITS THE WHOLE OF HELLAS USED ONCE TO CARRY ARMS THEIR HABITATIONS BEING UNPROTECTED
IN THE LAST STATE OF PERFECTION AND HE COULD SEE THE REST OF THE HELLENIC RACE TAKING SIDES IN THE QUARREL THOSE WHO DELAYED DOING SO AT ONCE HAVING IT IN CONTEMPLATION INDEED THIS WAS THE GREATEST MOVEMENT YET KNOWN IN HISTORY
THE REVENUES OF THE STATES INCREASING TYRANNIES WERE BY THEIR MEANS ESTABLISHED ALMOST EVERYWHERE THE OLD FORM OF GOVERNMENT BEING HEREDITARY MONARCHY WITH DEFINITE PREROGATIVES
ONCE AND FOR ALL PUT DOWN BY LACEDAEMON FOR THIS CITY THOUGH AFTER THE SETTLEMENT OF THE DORIANS ITS PRESENT INHABITANTS IT SUFFERED FROM FACTIONS FOR AN UNPARALLELED LENGTH OF TIME STILL AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD OBTAINED GOOD LAWS
FAR FROM PERMITTING MYSELF TO DERIVE IT FROM THE FIRST SOURCE THAT CAME TO HAND I DID NOT EVEN TRUST MY OWN IMPRESSIONS BUT IT RESTS PARTLY ON WHAT I SAW MYSELF PARTLY ON WHAT OTHERS SAW FOR ME THE ACCURACY OF THE REPORT BEING ALWAYS TRIED BY THE MOST SEVERE AND DETAILED TESTS POSSIBLE
FOR THEY HOPE BY THEIR ABSENCE TO EXTEND THEIR ACQUISITIONS YOU FEAR BY YOUR ADVANCE TO ENDANGER WHAT YOU HAVE LEFT BEHIND THEY ARE SWIFT TO FOLLOW UP A SUCCESS AND SLOW TO RECOIL FROM A REVERSE THEIR BODIES THEY SPEND UNGRUDGINGLY IN THEIR COUNTRY'S CAUSE
FROM THE REST OF HELLAS TOOK REFUGE WITH THE ATHENIANS AS A SAFE RETREAT AND AT AN EARLY PERIOD BECOMING NATURALIZED SWELLED THE ALREADY LARGE POPULATION OF THE CITY TO SUCH A HEIGHT THAT ATTICA BECAME AT LAST TOO SMALL TO HOLD THEM
AND SO THE POWER OF THE DESCENDANTS OF PELOPS CAME TO BE GREATER THAN THAT OF THE DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS
BUT NO EXACT OBSERVER WOULD THEREFORE FEEL JUSTIFIED IN REJECTING THE ESTIMATE GIVEN BY THE POETS AND BY TRADITION OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ARMAMENT FOR I SUPPOSE IF LACEDAEMON WERE TO BECOME DESOLATE
VARIOUS TOO WERE THE OBSTACLES WHICH THE NATIONAL GROWTH ENCOUNTERED IN VARIOUS LOCALITIES THE POWER OF THE IONIANS WAS ADVANCING WITH RAPID STRIDES WHEN IT CAME INTO COLLISION WITH PERSIA UNDER KING CYRUS WHO AFTER HAVING DETHRONED CROESUS
WHEREAS IF ATHENS WERE TO SUFFER THE SAME MISFORTUNE I SUPPOSE THAT ANY INFERENCE FROM THE APPEARANCE PRESENTED TO THE EYE
AND LEAD THE WHOLE NOT TO SPEAK OF THEIR NUMEROUS ALLIES WITHOUT STILL AS THE CITY IS NEITHER BUILT IN A COMPACT FORM NOR ADORNED WITH MAGNIFICENT TEMPLES AND PUBLIC EDIFICES BUT COMPOSED OF VILLAGES AFTER THE OLD FASHION OF HELLAS
SHE CAME AND LOUDLY ACCUSED ATHENS OF BREACH OF THE TREATY AND AGGRESSION ON THE RIGHTS OF PELOPONNESE WITH HER THE AEGINETANS FORMALLY UNREPRESENTED FROM FEAR OF ATHENS IN SECRET PROVED NOT THE LEAST URGENT OF THE ADVOCATES FOR WAR
SO THAT MUCH HAD TO BE DONE AND MANY YEARS HAD TO ELAPSE BEFORE HELLAS COULD ATTAIN TO A DURABLE TRANQUILLITY UNDISTURBED BY REMOVALS AND COULD BEGIN TO SEND OUT COLONIES AS ATHENS DID TO IONIA AND MOST OF THE ISLANDS
SON OF CAPATON UPON THE RIVER CAICINUS TOOK SOME ARMS AND DEPARTED
AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT THE PROPOSED TOWN WOULD LIE CONVENIENTLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE WAR AGAINST THE ATHENIANS
TELL ME NOT I GO OUT FROM YOUR HEARTS AND IF IN AFTER HOURS SOME OTHER WANDERER IN THIS WORLD OF OURS TOUCH AT YOUR SHORES AND ASK YOUR MAIDENS HERE WHO SINGS THE SONGS THE SWEETEST TO YOUR EAR THINK OF ME THEN AND ANSWER WITH A SMILE A BLIND OLD MAN OF SCIO'S ROCKY ISLE
THAN BY THOSE OF THE BARBAROUS AND DETESTED AMPHILOCHIANS OF THE LARGE AMBRACIOT FORCE DESTROYED IN THIS MANNER A FEW ONLY REACHED THE CITY IN SAFETY WHILE THE ACARNANIANS AFTER STRIPPING THE DEAD AND SETTING UP A TROPHY RETURNED TO ARGOS
AND WITH THE REST ENCAMPED IN AMPHILOCHIA AT THE PLACE CALLED CRENAE OR THE WELLS TO WATCH FOR EURYLOCHUS AND HIS PELOPONNESIANS AND TO PREVENT THEIR PASSING THROUGH AND EFFECTING THEIR JUNCTION WITH THE AMBRACIOTS
BUT WE FOUGHT WITH NO ONE YESTERDAY BUT THE DAY BEFORE IN THE RETREAT
THAT IT WAS A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM HAVING SO LARGE AN ARMY ASSEMBLED TO ATTACK THE AETOLIANS WHO WERE NOT ONLY THE ENEMIES OF NAUPACTUS BUT WHOSE REDUCTION WOULD FURTHER MAKE IT EASY TO GAIN THE REST OF THAT PART OF THE CONTINENT FOR THE ATHENIANS THE AETOLIAN NATION ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS AND WARLIKE
AT LAST HOWEVER SOMEONE OPENED THEIR EYES TO THE TRUTH UPON WHICH THEY CALLED UPON THE ATHENIANS TO KILL THEM THEMSELVES IF SUCH WAS THEIR PLEASURE AND REFUSED ANY LONGER TO GO OUT OF THE BUILDING AND SAID THEY WOULD DO ALL THEY COULD TO PREVENT ANY ONE COMING IN
THE DEAD THEY GAVE BACK TO HIM AND SETTING UP A TROPHY TOOK UP THEIR OWN ALSO TO THE NUMBER OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THE RETREAT DEMANDED THEY REFUSED PUBLICLY TO THE ARMY BUT PERMISSION TO DEPART WITHOUT DELAY WAS SECRETLY GRANTED TO THE MANTINEANS AND TO MENEDAIUS
FINDING THAT THIS FORCE HAD ENTERED AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STORM THE TOWN WITHDREW NOT TO PELOPONNESE BUT TO THE COUNTRY ONCE CALLED AEOLIS AND NOW CALYDON AND PLEURON AND TO THE PLACES IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND PROSCHIUM IN AETOLIA
SET OUT FROM PROSCHIUM WITH ALL HASTE TO JOIN THEM AND CROSSING THE ACHELOUS ADVANCED THROUGH ACARNANIA WHICH THEY FOUND DESERTED BY ITS POPULATION WHO HAD GONE TO THE RELIEF OF ARGOS
WHEN BOTH SIDES WERE READY THEY JOINED BATTLE DEMOSTHENES BEING ON THE RIGHT WING WITH THE MESSENIANS AND A FEW ATHENIANS WHILE THE REST OF THE LINE WAS MADE UP OF THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS OF THE ACARNANIANS
WITH THEIR HELLENIC ALLIES AND SUCH OF THE SICEL SUBJECTS OR ALLIES OF SYRACUSE AS HAD REVOLTED FROM HER AND JOINED THEIR ARMY MARCHED AGAINST THE SICEL TOWN INESSA THE ACROPOLIS OF WHICH WAS HELD BY THE SYRACUSANS AND AFTER ATTACKING IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE IT RETIRED
HIS PREPARATIONS COMPLETED EURYLOCHUS LODGED THE HOSTAGES IN KYTINIUM IN DORIS AND ADVANCED UPON NAUPACTUS THROUGH THE COUNTRY OF THE LOCRIANS
THEY ACCORDINGLY SENT WITH HIM ON BOARD HIS SHIPS A THOUSAND HEAVY INFANTRY WHO THREW THEMSELVES INTO THE PLACE AND SAVED IT THE EXTENT OF ITS WALL AND THE SMALL NUMBER OF ITS DEFENDERS OTHERWISE PLACING IT IN THE GREATEST DANGER MEANWHILE EURYLOCHUS AND HIS COMPANIONS
FIRST THEIR NEIGHBOURS THE MYONIANS WHO HELD THE MOST DIFFICULT OF THE PASSES
INDEED THE ATHENIAN ARMY FELL VICTIMS TO DEATH IN EVERY FORM AND SUFFERED ALL THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT
KNOWING NOTHING OF THE DISASTER AND FANCYING THAT THEY WERE THOSE OF THEIR OWN PARTY SOME ONE ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS SO ASTONISHED AT AND HOW MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN KILLED FANCYING IN HIS TURN THAT THIS WAS THE HERALD FROM THE TROOPS AT IDOMENE HE REPLIED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED
ALL THE WOMEN TAKEN IN THE STRONGHOLD WERE SOLD AS SLAVES IN THIS WAY THE CORCYRAEANS OF THE MOUNTAIN WERE DESTROYED BY THE COMMONS AND SO AFTER TERRIBLE EXCESSES THE PARTY STRIFE CAME TO AN END
WERE AFRAID THAT IT MIGHT PROVE A VERY POWERFUL NEIGHBOUR AND ACCORDINGLY CONTINUALLY HARASSED AND MADE WAR UPON THE NEW SETTLERS UNTIL THEY AT LAST WORE THEM OUT IN SPITE OF THEIR ORIGINALLY CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS PEOPLE FLOCKING FROM ALL QUARTERS TO A PLACE FOUNDED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS
AND DESCENDED INTO THE ARGIVE TERRITORY AFTER NIGHTFALL AND PASSING BETWEEN THE CITY OF ARGOS AND THE ACARNANIAN POSTS AT CRENAE
THE AMBRACIOTS HAVING COME AND URGED THEM TO COMBINE WITH THEM IN ATTACKING AMPHILOCHIAN ARGOS AND THE REST OF AMPHILOCHIA AND ACARNANIA AFFIRMING THAT THE CONQUEST OF THESE COUNTRIES WOULD BRING ALL THE CONTINENT INTO ALLIANCE WITH LACEDAEMON
PARTICULARLY AT ORCHOMENUS IN THE LAST NAMED COUNTRY
A GARRISON OF HEAVY INFANTRY WAS ALSO REGULARLY SENT THERE AND GREAT ATTENTION PAID TO THE ISLAND AS IT WAS THE LANDING PLACE FOR THE MERCHANTMEN FROM EGYPT AND LIBYA AND AT THE SAME TIME SECURED LACONIA FROM THE ATTACKS OF PRIVATEERS FROM THE SEA
THE FIRST DAY HE TOOK POTIDANIA THE NEXT KROKYLE AND THE THIRD TICHIUM WHERE HE HALTED AND SENT BACK THE BOOTY TO EUPALIUM IN LOCRIS HAVING DETERMINED TO PURSUE HIS CONQUESTS AS FAR AS THE OPHIONIANS AND IN THE EVENT OF THEIR REFUSING TO SUBMIT
IN THE RETREAT THE ALLIES RETREATING AFTER THE ATHENIANS WERE ATTACKED BY THE SYRACUSANS FROM THE FORT AND A LARGE PART OF THEIR ARMY ROUTED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER AFTER THIS LACHES AND THE ATHENIANS FROM THE SHIPS MADE SOME DESCENTS IN LOCRIS AND DEFEATING THE LOCRIANS WHO CAME AGAINST THEM WITH PROXENUS
NOT INDEED THE WHOLE ISLAND BUT AS MUCH OF IT AS COULD BE SEEN FROM THE TEMPLE ALL OF IT WAS HOWEVER NOW PURIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING WAY
OBTAINED THAT AN ARMY SHOULD BE SENT THEM AGAINST NAUPACTUS WHICH HAD INVITED THE ATHENIAN INVASION THE LACEDAEMONIANS ACCORDINGLY SENT OFF TOWARDS AUTUMN THREE THOUSAND HEAVY INFANTRY OF THE ALLIES FIVE HUNDRED OF WHOM WERE FROM HERACLEA
AND PLENTY OF OTHER SUPPLIES AND MIGHT FROM THIS BASE EASILY RAVAGE LESBOS WHICH WAS NOT FAR OFF AND MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE AEOLIAN TOWNS ON THE CONTINENT
THESE REPRESENTATIONS SUCCEEDING IT WAS SO ARRANGED THAT THE MEN WERE CAUGHT SAILING OUT IN THE BOAT THAT WAS PROVIDED AND THE TREATY BECAME VOID ACCORDINGLY
INVOKE THY FAVOUR ON EACH MANLY GAME AND DANCE AND SING IN HONOUR OF THY NAME THAT THERE WAS ALSO A POETICAL CONTEST IN WHICH THE IONIANS WENT TO CONTEND AGAIN IS SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING TAKEN FROM THE SAME HYMN
IN LATER TIMES ALTHOUGH THE ISLANDERS AND THE ATHENIANS CONTINUED TO SEND THE CHOIRS OF DANCERS WITH SACRIFICES THE CONTESTS AND MOST OF THE CEREMONIES WERE ABOLISHED PROBABLY THROUGH ADVERSITY UNTIL THE ATHENIANS CELEBRATED THE GAMES UPON THIS OCCASION WITH THE NOVELTY OF HORSE RACES
THREW DOWN THE TILES AND LET FLY ARROWS AT THEM FROM WHICH THE PRISONERS SHELTERED THEMSELVES AS WELL AS THEY COULD MOST OF THEIR NUMBER MEANWHILE WERE ENGAGED IN DISPATCHING THEMSELVES BY THRUSTING INTO THEIR THROATS THE ARROWS SHOT BY THE ENEMY AND HANGING THEMSELVES WITH THE CORDS TAKEN FROM SOME BEDS THAT HAPPENED TO BE THERE
THE ACARNANIANS AND A FEW OF THE AMPHILOCHIANS MOST OF WHOM WERE KEPT BACK BY FORCE BY THE AMBRACIOTS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT ARGOS AND WERE PREPARING TO GIVE BATTLE TO THE ENEMY HAVING CHOSEN DEMOSTHENES TO COMMAND THE WHOLE OF THE ALLIED ARMY IN CONCERT WITH THEIR OWN GENERALS
HAVE GONE WITHOUT HIS DINNER ONCE OR BEEN SOAKED TO THE SKIN IN A SHOWER CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR HAD SAILED OVER THE SURFACE OF THE OCEANS AS SOME MEN GO SKIMMING OVER THE YEARS OF EXISTENCE TO SINK GENTLY INTO A PLACID GRAVE IGNORANT OF LIFE TO THE LAST
AND THERE WAS A QUEER WHITE MISTY PATCH IN THE SKY LIKE A HALO OF THE SUN THE FORE DECK PACKED WITH CHINAMEN WAS FULL OF SOMBRE CLOTHING YELLOW FACES AND PIGTAILS
A CROSS SWELL HAD SET IN FROM THE DIRECTION OF FORMOSA CHANNEL ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK WITHOUT DISTURBING THESE PASSENGERS MUCH BECAUSE THE NAN SHAN WITH HER FLAT BOTTOM ROLLING CHOCKS ON BILGES AND GREAT BREADTH OF BEAM
BREATHE FRESH AIR GOOD EH WASHEE HIM PIECIE PANTS CHOW CHOW TOP SIDE SEE JOHN WITH HIS MOUTH AND HANDS HE MADE EXUBERANT MOTIONS OF EATING RICE AND WASHING CLOTHES AND THE CHINAMAN WHO CONCEALED HIS DISTRUST OF THIS PANTOMIME
OLD MISTER SIGG LIKED A MAN OF FEW WORDS AND ONE THAT YOU COULD BE SURE WOULD NOT TRY TO IMPROVE UPON HIS INSTRUCTIONS
WHICH TO THE END OF HIS LIFE HE EXERCISED IN HIS INTERCOURSE WITH HIS SON A LITTLE PITYINGLY AS IF UPON A HALF WITTED PERSON
TO WHOM THE VIEW OF A DISTANT EVENTUALITY COULD APPEAL NO MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF A WIDE LANDSCAPE TO A PURBLIND TOURIST AND HIS EYES HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT TO BE AT REST UPON THE LOCK OF THE CABIN DOOR HE WALKED UP TO IT
THE CHIEF ENGINEER ONLY CLEARED HIS THROAT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO KNOWS THE VALUE OF A GOOD BILLET THE FIRST MORNING THE NEW FLAG FLOATED OVER THE STERN OF THE NAN SHAN JUKES STOOD LOOKING AT IT BITTERLY FROM THE BRIDGE
WHEN SHE LAY AFLOAT FINISHED IN EVERY DETAIL AND READY TO TAKE UP THE WORK OF HER LIFE THE BUILDERS CONTEMPLATED HER WITH PRIDE SIGG HAS ASKED US FOR A RELIABLE SKIPPER TO TAKE HER OUT REMARKED ONE OF THE PARTNERS AND THE OTHER AFTER REFLECTING FOR A WHILE SAID
BUT IT IS DULL TOO TO BE WITH A MAN LIKE THIS IN THE LONG RUN OLD SOL SAYS HE HASN'T MUCH CONVERSATION CONVERSATION O LORD HE NEVER TALKS THE OTHER DAY I HAD BEEN YARNING UNDER THE BRIDGE WITH ONE OF THE ENGINEERS AND HE MUST HAVE HEARD US
BECAUSE THE CHIEF ENGINEER HAD ENOUGH IMAGINATION TO KEEP HIS DESK LOCKED HIS WIFE RELISHED HIS STYLE GREATLY THEY WERE A CHILDLESS COUPLE AND MISSUS ROUT A BIG HIGH BOSOMED JOLLY WOMAN OF FORTY
HE WENT ABOUT GRUMBLING TO HIMSELF AND UTTERING SHORT SCORNFUL LAUGHS FANCY HAVING A RIDICULOUS NOAH'S ARK ELEPHANT IN THE ENSIGN OF ONE'S SHIP HE SAID ONCE AT THE ENGINE ROOM DOOR DASH ME IF I CAN STAND IT I'LL THROW UP THE BILLET DON'T IT MAKE YOU SICK MISTER ROUT
THERE WERE MATTERS OF DUTY OF COURSE
THAT'S HIS REGULAR PERFORMANCE BY AND BY HE SAYS
RATTLED OVER THE SIDE AND THE WHOLE SHIP QUIVERED WITH HER LONG GRAY FLANKS SMOKING IN WREATHS OF STEAM NO CRIED JUKES I DIDN'T WHAT'S THE GOOD I MIGHT JUST AS WELL FLING MY RESIGNATION AT THIS BULKHEAD I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN MAKE A MAN LIKE THAT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
OH AYE THE BLESSED GAMP THANK EE JUKES THANK EE WOULD MUTTER CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR HEARTILY WITHOUT LOOKING UP HAVING JUST ENOUGH IMAGINATION TO CARRY HIM THROUGH EACH SUCCESSIVE DAY AND NO MORE HE WAS TRANQUILLY SURE OF HIMSELF
HE WORE A BROWN BOWLER HAT A COMPLETE SUIT OF A BROWNISH HUE AND CLUMSY BLACK BOOTS THESE HARBOUR TOGS GAVE TO HIS THICK FIGURE AN AIR OF STIFF AND UNCOUTH SMARTNESS A THIN SILVER WATCH CHAIN LOOPED HIS WAISTCOAT
AND FROM HIS INEXPERIENCE OF JOLLY WOMEN FULLY PERSUADED THAT SHE MUST BE DEPLORABLY INSANE THEY WERE EXCELLENT FRIENDS AFTERWARDS
HE STRUGGLED WITH HIS FEELINGS FOR A WHILE AND THEN REMARKED QUEER FLAG FOR A MAN TO SAIL UNDER SIR WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE FLAG INQUIRED CAPTAIN MAC WHIRR SEEMS ALL RIGHT TO ME AND HE WALKED ACROSS TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE TO HAVE A GOOD LOOK
HOW IS IT THAT YOU LET TAIT'S PEOPLE PUT US OFF WITH A DEFECTIVE LOCK ON THE CABIN DOOR THE CAPTAIN COULD SEE DIRECTLY HE SET EYE ON IT HAVE IT REPLACED AT ONCE THE LITTLE STRAWS BATES THE LITTLE STRAWS THE LOCK WAS REPLACED ACCORDINGLY
JUKES FLUNG THE NEW LEAD LINE OVER ON THE FORE DECK WITH A LOUD
HAD THE HEAVY OBVIOUSNESS OF A LUMP OF CLAY ON THE OTHER HAND MISTER JUKES UNABLE TO GENERALIZE UNMARRIED AND UNENGAGED WAS IN THE HABIT OF OPENING HIS HEART AFTER ANOTHER FASHION TO AN OLD CHUM AND FORMER SHIPMATE
STUTTERED THE YOUNG MAN VERY RED IN THE FACE I MUST SAY I DON'T HE'S MY HUSBAND SHE ANNOUNCED IN A GREAT SHOUT THROWING HERSELF BACK IN THE CHAIR PERCEIVING THE JOKE SHE LAUGHED IMMODERATELY WITH A HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES
GIVE ME THE DULLEST ASS FOR A SKIPPER BEFORE A ROGUE
HE WAS NOT ALONE IN HIS OPINION THE SEA ITSELF AS IF SHARING MISTER JUKES GOOD NATURED FORBEARANCE HAD NEVER PUT ITSELF OUT TO STARTLE THE SILENT MAN WHO SELDOM LOOKED UP AND WANDERED INNOCENTLY OVER THE WATERS WITH THE ONLY VISIBLE PURPOSE OF GETTING FOOD
A BRAND NEW LOCK AND IT WON'T ACT AT ALL STUCK FAST SEE SEE AS SOON AS THEY FOUND THEMSELVES ALONE IN THEIR OFFICE ACROSS THE YARD YOU PRAISED THAT FELLOW UP TO SIGG
WHICH HE HUNG ON THE END OF A STEAM WINDLESS EMBODYING ALL THE LATEST IMPROVEMENTS MY UNCLE WROTE OF YOU FAVOURABLY BY YESTERDAY'S MAIL TO OUR GOOD FRIENDS MESSRS SIGG YOU KNOW
AND IN THE COURSE OF YEARS HE DESPATCHED OTHER LETTERS TO HIS PARENTS INFORMING THEM OF HIS SUCCESSIVE PROMOTIONS AND OF HIS MOVEMENTS UPON THE VAST EARTH IN THESE MISSIVES COULD BE FOUND SENTENCES LIKE THIS THE HEAT HERE IS VERY GREAT OR
THEY INTERESTED HIM MUCH MORE THAN THEY POSSIBLY COULD THE WOMAN FOR WHOSE EYE THEY WERE INTENDED AND THIS FOR THE REASON THAT THEY RELATED IN MINUTE DETAIL EACH SUCCESSIVE TRIP OF THE NAN SHAN HER MASTER FAITHFUL TO FACTS WHICH ALONE HIS CONSCIOUSNESS REFLECTED
WHAT UNDER HEAVEN COULD HAVE INDUCED THAT PERFECTLY SATISFACTORY SON OF A PETTY GROCER IN BELFAST TO RUN AWAY TO SEA AND YET HE HAD DONE THAT VERY THING AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN IT WAS ENOUGH WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT OVER
AND THE HEAT WAS CLOSE THE COOLIES LOUNGED TALKED SMOKED OR STARED OVER THE RAIL SOME DRAWING WATER OVER THE SIDE SLUICED EACH OTHER A FEW SLEPT ON HATCHES WHILE SEVERAL SMALL PARTIES OF SIX SAT ON THEIR HEELS
WHILE HE OBSERVED IN HIS LOW EARNEST VOICE
AND HAD AS LIKE AS NOT BEEN TRAMPING IT OVER PLODDEN FIELD AND THAT HISTORIC CORNER OF THE COUNTRY AND HAD BECOME BENIGHTED ERE HE COULD REACH WHEREVER HIS HEADQUARTERS WERE AND I WAS NOT GOING TO BRING SUSPICION
AND HE'S AT PRESENT IN HIS BED WITH A CHILL OR SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE TO KEEP HIM THERE AND TONIGHT HE GOT ME TO RIDE OUT HERE TO MEET A MAN WHOM HE OUGHT TO HAVE MET HIMSELF AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE AND ALL THAT I HAVE TO DO WITH IT
UNTIL THE MOMENT YOU'RE MY WIFE MEANTIME I'LL TRY TO GROW A BIT MORE LIKE WHAT YOUR LOVER OUGHT TO BE AND LATER I SHALL KISS YOU ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IF FIVE HOURS AGO ANY ONE HAD TOLD ANNESLEY GRAYLE
AND AGAIN THE GIRL HAD A FEW MOMENTS OF SUSPENSE THINKING OF THE DANGER WHICH MIGHT NOT AFTER ALL BE OVER JUST AS SHE HAD BEGUN TO BE ANXIOUS HOWEVER SHE SAW HIM COMING WITH A WONDERFUL WOMAN ANNESLEY COULD HAVE LAUGHED
I HEAR FROM MISS GRAYLE THAT WE ARE NAMESAKES MISTER RUTHVEN SMITH SAID AS NELSON SMITH SPRANG IN AND TOOK THE GIRL'S BAG FROM HER ICE COLD HAND I HE ASKED ME I TOLD HIM
THERE ARE EVEN REASONS WHY I'M PLEASED THAT YOU'VE MADE ME A PRESENT OF THE NAME I THANK YOU FOR IT AND FOR ALL THE REST OH BUT IF IT ISN'T REALLY YOUR NAME WE SHA'N'T BE LEGALLY MARRIED SHALL WE ANNESLEY PROTESTED
MISS GRAYLE AND I WILL GO TOGETHER TWO WOMEN ALONE AND INDEPENDENT LUCKY IT'S NOT THE SEASON OR WE MIGHT FIND NOTHING FREE AT SHORT NOTICE BUT DON I MEAN NELSON ALWAYS DID HAVE LUCK I HOPE HE ALWAYS WILL
THAT I SAW HIM IN A STRONGER LIGHT I FOUND THAT HE WAS A STRONGLY BUILT WELL MADE MAN OF ABOUT MISTER GILVERTHWAITE'S AGE SAY JUST OVER SIXTY YEARS OR SO DRESSED IN A GENTLEMANLIKE FASHION AND WEARING GOOD BOOTS
SHE FLASHED HIM A MEANING LOOK THOUGH WHAT THE MEANING WAS ANNESLEY COULD NOT GUESS SHE KNEW ONLY THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE THE COUNTESS AS SHE HAD WISHED TO LIKE HER LOVER'S FRIEND
AND IT'S NO CONCERN OF MINE TO KEEP IT BACK AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT NOT ME THE TRUTH IS WE'VE A LODGER AT OUR HOUSE ONE MISTER JAMES GILVERTHWAITE THAT'S A MYSTERIOUS SORT OF MAN
BUT IF I CAN GIVE YOU A HAPPY LIFE AND A FEW OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS YOU DESERVE WHY IT'S SOMETHING BESIDES I'M GOING TO WORSHIP MY PRINCESS I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO SHOW YOU HOW I BUT NO
YET AGAIN WAS THIS SOME MAN WHO HAD COME UPON MISTER GILVERTHWAITE'S CORRESPONDENT AND FOR SOME REASON BEEN MURDERED BY HIM IT WAS HOWEVER ALL BEYOND ME JUST THEN AND PRESENTLY THE SERGEANT AND I WERE ON OUR MACHINES
ON WHAT WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY AN INNOCENT STRANGER SO I ANSWERED CHISHOLM'S QUESTION AS I MEANT TO ANSWER ANY SIMILAR ONE UNLESS INDEED I HAD REASON TO ALTER MY MIND
WELL YOU CAN TRUST ME WITH MISSUS ELLSWORTH IF SHE GOES ON AS SHE BEGAN TO NIGHT I'M AFRAID I SHALL HAVE TO FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLE FOLD MY TENT LIKE AN ARAB AND SILENTLY STEAL AWAY HA HA
STILL ANNESLEY HOPED THAT HER LOVER HAD NOT ASKED THE LADY TO MOTHER HIS FIANCEE SHE HAD NOT THE AIR OF ONE WHO WOULD BE COMPLIMENTED BY SUCH A REQUEST AS ANNESLEY PUT HER HAND INTO THAT OF THE COUNTESS
THEN THEY WERE OFF THEY TWO ALONE TOGETHER AND ANNESLEY GUESSED THAT THE CHAUFFEUR MUST HAVE HAD HIS INSTRUCTIONS WHERE TO DRIVE AS SHE HEARD NONE GIVEN PERHAPS IT WAS BEST THAT THEIR DESTINATION SHOULD NOT BE PUBLISHED ALOUD FOR THERE ARE WALLS WHICH HAVE EARS
BUT SHE SAT STILL IN HER CORNER OF THE TAXI AND GAVE HIM NO ANSWER LEST SHE SHOULD BETRAY HERSELF HER SILENCE AFTER THE WARMTH OF HIS WORDS SEEMED COLD PERHAPS HE FELT IT SO
THAT'S JUST WHERE I'M COMING WITH YOU HE ANSWERED I'VE MY BICYCLE CLOSE BY AND WE'LL RIDE INTO THE TOWN TOGETHER AT ONCE FOR DO YOU SEE MISTER HUGH
SHE COULD NOT PARRY THE MAN'S QUESTIONS SHE COULD NOT BEAR HIS GRIEVED OR OFFENDED REPROACHES IF HE PERSISTED THROUGH THESE MOMENTS OF SUSPENSE SHE WOULD SCREAM OR BURST OUT CRYING TREMBLING WITH TEARS IN HER VOICE SHE HEARD HERSELF ANSWER
NOT CARING TO STAY LONGER FOR I HAD HEARD WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE SPOT BY A SINGLE BLOW FROM A KNIFE OR DAGGER WHICH HAD BEEN THRUST INTO HIS HEART FROM BEHIND WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE AND THE THOUGHT OF IT
BUT IT HAD BEEN BORNE IN ON MY MIND PRETTY STRONGLY THAT THE MAN I HAD SEEN LOOKING AT HIS MAP WAS SOME GENTLEMAN TOURIST WHO WAS WALKING THE DISTRICT
I TELL YOU MEETING YOU AND WINNING YOU IN THIS WAY IS WORTH THE BEST TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE BUT YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION I'LL ANSWER IT NOW CRIED THE GIRL MEETING YOU IS WORTH ALL THE YEARS OF MY LIFE
YOU COULDN'T HELP YOURSELF DESTINY AND ALL'S FOR THE BEST YOU WERE AN ANGEL TO SACRIFICE YOURSELF TO SAVE ME AND YOUR DOING IT THE WAY YOU DID HAS MADE ME A HAPPY MAN AT ONE STROKE AS FOR THE NAME
AFTERWARD YOU'LL BE NICE TO HER AND THAT WILL BE DOING HER A GOOD TURN BECAUSE SHE'S APT TO BE LONESOME IN LONDON
AND HAS LIVED IN THE ARGENTINE BUT I MET HER IN NEW YORK SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT ME OR ENOUGH AND IF SHE'D BEEN IN THE RESTAURANT AT DINNER THIS EVENING SHE COULD HAVE DONE FOR ME WHAT YOU DID I HAD REASON TO THINK SHE WOULD BE THERE WHEN I BOLTED IN TO GET OUT OF A FIX
WAS THIS THE MAN MISTER GILVERTHWAITE MEANT ME TO MEET WOULD MISTER GILVERTHWAITE HAVE BEEN MURDERED TOO IF HE HAD COME THERE IN PERSON AND HAD THE MAN BEEN MURDERED FOR THE SAKE OF ROBBERY
TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT HER HUGHIE WAS ALIVE AND SAFE WOULD HAVE TO LIE QUAKING AND SPECULATING THROUGH THE DARK HOURS OF THAT NIGHT
THEY WERE NOT LIKE TO HAVE LEFT THAT THEN I WONDERED IF I HAD DISTURBED THE MURDERERS IT WAS FIXED IN ME FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ONE IN AT THIS DREADFUL GAME
THE BRIDAL VEIL SHOOTS FREE FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF THE CLIFF BY THE VELOCITY THE STREAM HAS ACQUIRED IN DESCENDING A LONG SLOPE ABOVE THE HEAD OF THE FALL LOOKING FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCK AVALANCHE TALUS ON THE WEST SIDE
IT WILL AMUSE ME TO LOOK ON SO THE RETAINERS WENT OUT AND BROUGHT IN THE IMPOSTOR BEFORE THEIR LORD
BUT TO MOST PEOPLE INACCESSIBLE AS YET ON ACCOUNT OF ITS ROUGH STEEP BOULDER CHOKED CANYON
IN TRANQUIL RICHLY EMBOWERED REACHES BEYOND THIS LITTLE YOSEMITE IN THE MAIN CANYON THERE ARE THREE OTHER LITTLE YOSEMITES THE HIGHEST SITUATED A FEW MILES BELOW THE BASE OF MOUNT LYELL
WOULD TAKE WHAT HE HAD SAVED FROM THE MEAL OUT TO THE LITTLE VERANDA THAT RAN ROUND THE COTTAGE SURE ENOUGH SHIRO WAS WAITING FOR HIS MASTER AND THE EVENING TIT BIT THEN THE OLD MAN SAID CHIN CHIN AND SHIRO SAT UP AND BEGGED
ALL THE WIDE FAN SHAPED UPPER PORTION OF THE BASIN IS COVERED WITH A NETWORK OF SMALL RILLS THAT GO CHEERILY ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR GRAND FALL IN THE VALLEY NOW FLOWING ON SMOOTH PAVEMENTS IN SHEETS THIN AS GLASS
BUT THAT HE NEVER LOST AN OPPORTUNITY OF STRIKING AND TORMENTING HIM WHENEVER THE DOG CROSSED HIS PATH BUT THE GOOD OLD MAN WAS TOO KIND HEARTED TO REFUSE HIS NEIGHBOR SO HE CONSENTED TO LEND THE DOG
BUT SHIRO WENT ON BARKING AND DIGGING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THE THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE HIDDEN BENEATH THE TREE AND THAT THE DOG HAD SCENTED IT AT LAST STRUCK THE OLD MAN HE RAN BACK TO THE HOUSE
DAY AFTER DAY WENT BY AND THE GOOD OLD MAN WAITED IN VAIN THEN HE WENT TO HIS NEIGHBOR AND ASKED HIM TO GIVE HIM BACK HIS DOG WITHOUT ANY SHAME OR HESITATION
NEXT TO THE CATHEDRAL ROCKS ON THE SOUTH SIDE TOWERS THE SENTINEL ROCK TO A HEIGHT OF MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND FEET A TELLING MONUMENT OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD
WHOSE INFLUENCE IS SO MYSTERIOUS ON EVERY ONE WHO SEES IT OF THE SMALL GLACIER LAKES SO CHARACTERISTIC OF THESE UPPER REGIONS THERE ARE NO FEWER THAN SIXTY SEVEN IN THE BASIN OF THE MAIN MIDDLE BRANCH BESIDES COUNTLESS SMALLER POOLS
ACROSS THE VALLEY FROM HERE NEXT TO THE BRIDAL VEIL ARE THE PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL ROCKS NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH MAKING A NOBLE DISPLAY OF FINE YET MASSIVE SCULPTURE
THE STORY OF THE OLD MAN'S GARDEN SPREAD FAR AND WIDE AND PEOPLE FROM FAR AND NEAR CAME TO SEE THE WONDERFUL SIGHT ONE DAY SOON AFTER THIS THE OLD MAN HEARD SOME ONE KNOCKING AT HIS DOOR
MAKING A VERTICAL DESCENT IN ALL OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FEET JUST BEYOND THE DOME CASCADES ON THE SHOULDER OF MOUNT WATKINS THERE IS AN OLD TRAIL ONCE USED BY INDIANS ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RANGE TO MONO BUT IN THE CANYON ABOVE THIS POINT
CLAD IN GAUZY SUN SIFTED SPRAY HALF FALLING HALF FLOATING IT SEEMS INFINITELY GENTLE AND FINE BUT THE HYMNS IT SINGS
OF THE ANCIENT YOSEMITE GLACIER ABOUT TEN MILES ABOVE THE VALLEY WE COME TO THE BEAUTIFUL TENAYA LAKE AND HERE THE CANYON TERMINATES A MILE OR TWO ABOVE THE LAKE STANDS THE GRAND SIERRA CATHEDRAL
ENTERING THE VALLEY GAZING OVERWHELMED WITH THE MULTITUDE OF GRAND OBJECTS ABOUT US PERHAPS THE FIRST TO FIX OUR ATTENTION WILL BE THE BRIDAL VEIL A BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL ON OUR RIGHT ITS BROW
AND HIS MASTER GAVE HIM THE FOOD NEXT DOOR TO THIS GOOD OLD COUPLE THERE LIVED ANOTHER OLD MAN AND HIS WIFE WHO WERE BOTH WICKED AND CRUEL AND WHO HATED THEIR GOOD NEIGHBORS AND THE DOG SHIRO WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
WE COME WITHIN A FEW MILES TO THE VERNAL AND NEVADA FALLS FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED FEET HIGH
WITH THE SENTIMENTAL ONLOOKER FRESH FROM A VISIT TO THE BRIDAL VEIL JUST BEYOND THIS GLORIOUS FLOOD THE EL CAPITAN ROCK REGARDED BY MANY AS THE MOST SUBLIME FEATURE OF THE VALLEY
AND OF ALL THAT HAD SO AUSPICIOUSLY BEFALLEN HIM AND HE COULD NOT SUPPRESS ALL THE ENVY AND JEALOUSY THAT FILLED HIS HEART HE CALLED TO MIND HOW HE HAD FAILED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO FIND THE GOLD COINS AND THEN IN MAKING THE MAGIC CAKES
ON THE GROUND LAY WHAT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE PIECES OF A BROKEN MORTAR IN ANSWER TO THE OLD MAN'S INQUIRY THE WICKED NEIGHBOR ANSWERED HAUGHTILY HAVE YOU COME TO ASK ME FOR YOUR MORTAR
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE THE BRIDAL VEIL THERE IS ANOTHER FINE FALL CONSIDERABLY WIDER THAN THE VEIL WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST AND MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND FEET IN HEIGHT MEASURED FROM THE BROW OF THE CLIFF
WHERE IT FIRST SPRINGS OUT INTO THE AIR TO THE HEAD OF THE ROCKY TALUS ON WHICH IT STRIKES AND IS BROKEN UP INTO RAGGED CASCADES IT IS CALLED THE RIBBON FALL OR VIRGIN'S TEARS DURING THE SPRING FLOODS IT IS A MAGNIFICENT OBJECT
ON THE SOUTH SIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF THE BRIDAL VEIL CREEK THE BASIN OF WHICH IS NOTED FOR THE BEAUTY OF ITS MEADOWS AND ITS SUPERB FORESTS OF SILVER FIR ON THE NORTH SIDE
THE STREAM IS NEARLY FORTY FEET WIDE AND WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING RAPIDLY IN THE SPRING IT IS ABOUT FOUR FEET DEEP WITH A CURRENT OF TWO AND A HALF MILES AN HOUR THIS IS ABOUT THE VOLUME OF WATER THAT FORMS THE FALL IN MAY AND JUNE
INTO ANOTHER WORLD WHERE CLIMATE VEGETATION
TO ATTEMPT TO PASS THROUGH IT BEYOND THE CASCADES NO GREAT DIFFICULTY WILL BE ENCOUNTERED A SUCCESSION OF CHARMING LILY GARDENS AND MEADOWS OCCURS IN FILLED UP LAKE BASINS AMONG THE ROCK WAVES IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CANYON
IS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND FEET WHILE THE DISTANCE IS ONLY ABOUT TEN MILES AN AVERAGE FALL OF SIX HUNDRED FEET PER MILE THE LAST MILE OF ITS COURSE
A SHORT DISTANCE EAST OF PORCUPINE FLAT FROM THAT POINT PUSH STRAIGHT UP TO THE SUMMIT MOUNT HOFFMAN IS A MASS OF GRAY GRANITE THAT RISES ALMOST IN THE CENTER OF THE YOSEMITE PARK
GILIAS PHLOXES MIMULUS ET CETERA MANY OF THEM WITH MORE PETALS THAN LEAVES ON THE BORDERS OF LITTLE STREAMS LARGER PLANTS FLOURISH LUPINES DAISIES ASTERS GOLDENRODS
TO THE EASTWARD YOU GAZE FAR OUT OVER THE DESERT PLAINS AND MOUNTAINS OF THE GREAT BASIN RANGE BEYOND RANGE EXTENDING WITH SOFT OUTLINES BLUE AND PURPLE IN THE DISTANCE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND FEET BELOW YOU LIES LAKE MONO
CROSSING OF BUDD CREEK WHERE YOU WILL FIND THE SUNRISE TRAIL BRANCHING OFF UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THROUGH THE FOREST IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION PAST THE WEST SIDE OF CATHEDRAL PEAK
AND MANY A MEADOW ALONG THE CANYON STREAM THAT LINKS THEM TOGETHER THE MAIN LATERAL MORAINES THAT BOUND THE VIEW BELOW THE CANYON ARE FROM A HUNDRED TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND WONDERFULLY REGULAR
THENCE PUSH ON PAST TENAYA LAKE INTO THE TUOLUMNE MEADOWS AND ESTABLISH A CENTRAL CAMP NEAR THE SODA SPRINGS FROM WHICH GLORIOUS EXCURSIONS CAN BE MADE AT YOUR LEISURE
FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN SHUTS IT IN ON THE EAST MY CAMP WAS ON THE BRINK OF ONE OF THE LAKES IN A THICKET OF MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK PARTLY SHELTERED FROM THE WIND
THAT ONE MAY RIDE A MULE TO THE VERY SUMMIT ACROSS MANY A BUSY STREAM FROM MEADOW TO MEADOW LIES YOUR FLOWERY WAY MOUNTAINS ALL ABOUT YOU FEW OF THEM HIDDEN BY IRREGULAR FOREGROUNDS
SOUTHEASTWARD THE STARR KING
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE MOUNTAIN GO FAR ENOUGH DOWN THE NORTH SIDE FOR A VIEW OF THE DANA GLACIER
THREE BROTHERS AND EL CAPITAN WITH THE DOME PAVED BASIN OF YOSEMITE CREEK AND MOUNT HOFFMAN IN THE BACKGROUND
BACK TO THE WIDE TRANQUIL VALLEY
HAIRBELL MOUNTAIN COLUMBINE POTENTILLA ASTRAGALUS AND A FEW GENTIANS WITH CHARMING HEATHWORTS BRYANTHUS CASSIOPE KALMIA VACCINIUM IN BOULDER FRINGING RINGS OR BANK COVERS
ALL YOUR BODY AGLOW NERVE CURRENTS FLASHING THROUGH YOU NEVER BEFORE FELT GO TO THE TOP OF THE LIBERTY CAP ONLY A GLAD SAUNTER NOW THAT YOUR LEGS AS WELL AS HEAD AND HEART ARE AWAKE
BESIDE THE ENTHUSIASTIC THRONG OF STARRY COMET LIKE WATERS TO LEARN SOMETHING OF THEIR STRENGTH THEIR MARVELOUS VARIETY OF FORMS AND ABOVE ALL THEIR GLORIOUS MUSIC
AND BEYOND ALL MARSHALED ALONG THE EASTERN HORIZON THE ICY SUMMITS ON THE AXIS OF THE RANGE AND BROAD SWATHS OF FORESTS GROWING ON ANCIENT MORAINES WHILE THE NEVADA VERNAL
AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE FOOT OF THE WONDERFUL SERIES OF RIVER CATARACTS ALL OF THESE EXCURSIONS ARE SURE TO BE MADE MEMORABLE WITH JOYFUL HEALTH GIVING EXPERIENCES
NO MOUNTAIN TOP COULD BE BETTER PLACED FOR THIS MOST GLORIOUS OF MOUNTAIN VIEWS TO WATCH AND SEE THE DEEPENING COLORS OF THE DAWN AND THE SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE SNOWY HIGH SIERRA PASSES
STORM THEN FOLLOWS STORM IN QUICK SUCCESSION BURYING THE MEADOWS TO A DEPTH OF FROM TEN TO TWENTY FEET WHILE MAGNIFICENT AVALANCHES DESCEND THROUGH THE FORESTS FROM THE LADEN HEIGHTS
FROM WHICH A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME AGO ASHES AND CINDERS WERE SHOWERED OVER THE SURROUNDING SAGE PLAINS AND GLACIER LADEN MOUNTAINS
WHERE FROM AN OUTJUTTING ROCK AT ITS HEAD YOU WILL GET A FINE VIEW OF ITS REJOICING WATERS AND WILD CANYON AND THE HALF DOME THENCE RETURNING TO THE TRAIL FOLLOW IT TO THE HEAD OF THE NEVADA FALL
ALL ALONG THE MEADOWS AND ONE MAY MOVE FROM GROVE TO GROVE EVERY DAY ALL SUMMER ENJOYING NEW HOMES AND NEW BEAUTY TO SATISFY EVERY ROVING DESIRE FOR CHANGE
THE TOP OF LIBERTY CAP VERNAL FALL AND THE WILD BOULDER CHOKED RIVER CANYON THE TRAIL LEAVES THE VALLEY AT THE BASE OF THE SENTINEL ROCK
ANOTHER GRAND ONE DAY EXCURSION IS TO THE UPPER YOSEMITE FALL THE TOP OF THE HIGHEST OF THE THREE BROTHERS CALLED EAGLE PEAK ON THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MAPS THE BROW OF EL CAPITAN
AND IF CURIOUS ABOUT SUCH THINGS YOU MAY DISCOVER SPECIMENS OF THIS HARDY TREE MOUNTAINEER NOT MORE THAN FOUR FEET HIGH AND ABOUT AS MANY INCHES IN DIAMETER AT THE GROUND
STRANGE TO SAY AMID ALL THIS ARCTIC REPRESSION THE MOUNTAIN PINE ON LEDGES AND BUTTRESSES OF RED MOUNTAIN SEEMS TO FIND THE CLIMATE BEST SUITED TO IT
EARLY NEXT MORNING I SET OUT TO TRACE THE ANCIENT GLACIER TO ITS HEAD PASSING AROUND THE NORTH SHORE OF MY CAMP LAKE I FOLLOWED THE MAIN STREAM FROM ONE LAKELET TO ANOTHER
WHICH BROAD DEEP AND FAR REACHING EXERTED VAST INFLUENCE ON THE SCENERY OF THIS PORTION OF THE SIERRA BUT THERE ARE FINE CAMPING GROUNDS
THE SOD IN MOST PLACES IS EXCEEDINGLY FINE AND SILKY AND FREE FROM WEEDS AND BUSHES WHILE CHARMING FLOWERS ABOUND ESPECIALLY GENTIANS DWARF DAISIES POTENTILLAS
WERE THE MOST INTERESTING OF THEM ALL THE PATH OF THE VANISHED GLACIER SHONE IN MANY PLACES AS IF WASHED WITH SILVER AND PUSHING UP THE CANYON ON THIS BRIGHT ROAD I PASSED LAKE AFTER LAKE IN SOLID BASINS OF GRANITE
I SHOULD START AT DAYBREAK SAY AT THREE O'CLOCK IN MIDSUMMER WITH A POCKETFUL OF ANY SORT OF DRY BREAKFAST STUFF FOR GLACIER POINT SENTINEL DOME THE HEAD OF ILLILOUETTE FALL NEVADA FALL
THE TALL LEADER WITH THE RED FEATHER THE RAKISH HAT AND THE BLACK PATCH ALONE WAS MISSING FROM THE PICTURE IT'S THE STRANGEST LOOKING CREW I'VE EVER SEEN SAID ANGUISH THEY LOOK LIKE PIRATES OR GYPSIES SUGGESTED YETIVE WHO ARE THEY COLONEL QUINNOX WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE
SUPPOSE THERE IS NO ONE THERE SHE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN RAN ON FASTER THAN BEFORE I SHALL FIND HELP OVER THERE I KNOW I SHALL SHE THOUGHT AS SHE HURRIED OVER THE FROZEN GROUND AND MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE ICE HOUSE THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST
HURRIED AFTER HIM BUT SHE WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE AND COULD NOT RUN BY THE TIME SHE REACHED THE BANK HE HAD ROUNDED THE CORNER OF THE ICE HOUSE AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT
FOYLE PULLED OUT THE DOSSIER OF THE CASE AND AGAIN WENT OVER THE EVIDENCE THAT HAD BEEN COLLECTED HE KNEW IT PRACTICALLY BY HEART BUT ONE COULD NEVER BE TOO CERTAIN THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED HE WAS SO ENGAGED WHEN MISTER FRED TREVELYAN WAS ANNOUNCED
WHO HAD CERTAINLY BEEN BRAVE AND PATIENT DURING THE ORDEAL ALTHOUGH HE HAD UTTERED THE MOST FEARFUL SOUNDS AS SOON AS HIS FEET TOUCHED THE SOLID ICE HE SEIZED HIS WAGON AND MADE FOR THE BANK
I SAW HIM TO DAY FOYLE BEAT A TATTOO ON HIS DESK WITH HIS FINGERS THAT SO HE SAID LISTLESSLY OUT ON THE PORTSMOUTH ROAD I SUPPOSE DUTCH FRED SAT UP WITH A START YES HE AGREED JUST OUTSIDE KINGSTON HOW DID YOU KNOW JUST A GUESS LAUGHED THE SUPERINTENDENT
I DON'T THINK I CAN KEEP UP MUCH LONGER EXCLAIMED JULIA BEGINNING TO CRY AGAIN KEEP ON CRYING REPLIED TOM EXASPERATED IT WILL WARM YOU AND REMEMBER THAT I AM DOING THE KEEPING UP I DON'T SEE THAT YOU ARE MAKING ANY SPECIAL EFFORT IN THAT DIRECTION
GRACE SOON SAW HOWEVER THAT THE IDEA WAS NOT ENTIRELY IDIOTIC LATER SHE WAS TO OFFER UP A PRAYER OF THANKS FOR THAT SAME CHILD'S WAGON THE DEAF AND DUMB MAN WAS WEARING HEAVY ARCTIC RUBBERS WHICH KEPT HIM FROM SLIPPING WHILE GRACE WHOSE SOLES WERE AS SMOOTH AS GLASS
TOM TOM GRAY SHE CALLED WHERE ARE YOU RUN FOR HELP CAME THE ANSWER IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE SAW THEM CLINGING TO A BROKEN LEDGE OF ICE TOM SUPPORTING JULIA CROSBY AS FOR THE JUNIOR CAPTAIN SHE WAS WEEPING BITTERLY AND MAKING NO ATTEMPT TO HELP HERSELF
CHARGED WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF PRINCE LORENZ THEN BETROTHED TO THE PRINCESS LAY HIDDEN IN THE MONASTERY WHILE YETIVE'S OWN SOLDIERS HUNTED HIGH AND LOW FOR HIM THE NARRATOR DWELT GLOWINGLY UPON THE TRIP FROM THE MONASTERY TO THE CITY WALLS ONE DARK NIGHT
POINTING TO HIS WET CLOTHES I BELIEVE SHE WILL BE SAID GRACE SOFTLY AFTER ALL IT'S AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NO ONE GOOD
QUICKLY UNTWISTING A LONG MUFFLER OF RED SILK FROM ABOUT HER NECK GRACE TIED IT SECURELY IN THE MIDDLE AROUND THE CROSS PIECE OF THE TONGUE OF THE STOUT LITTLE VEHICLE THEN SHE PUSHED IT GENTLY UNTIL IT STOOD ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLE GIVING ONE END OF THE MUFFLER TO JULIA GRACE TOOK THE OTHER HERSELF
I AM A HIGHNESS ONCE IN A WHILE DON'T YOU KNOW I IMPLORE YOUR HIGHNESS'S PARDON SAID HE GAILY THE RIDERS AHEAD HAD COME TO A STANDSTILL AND WERE POINTING OFF INTO THE PASS TO THEIR RIGHT THEY WERE EIGHT OR TEN MILES FROM THE CITY GATES AND MORE THAN HALF WAY UP THE WINDING ROAD THAT ENDED AT THE MONASTERY GATES
BEVERLY AND QUINNOX CAME UP WITH THEM AND FOUND ALL EYES CENTERED ON A SMALL COMPANY OF MEN
TOM AND JULIA WERE LIABLE TO BE SUCKED UNDER AND DROWNED WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING FOR HELP GRACE PUSHED RESOLUTELY ON IN THE MEANTIME HARDLY FOUR MINUTES HAD REALLY ELAPSED SINCE THE SKATERS HAD TUMBLED INTO THE WATER
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK IN OUR TRADE I REMEMBER A CASE OF FORGERY ONCE
I THOUGHT IT WAS A QUEER GO BUT IT WASN'T NONE OF MY BUSINESS AND LADIES TAKE QUEER FANCIES AT TIMES SHE DIDN'T SAY NOTHING TO HIM THAT I COULD HEAR BUT JUST LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND BECKONED HE JUMPED IN AND OFF WE WENT WE STOPPED AT A TAILOR'S SHOP IN KINGSTON AND THE MAN WENT IN WHILE THE LADY STAYED IN THE CAB WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE SHOP
HE COULD RIDE LIKE A COSSACK OR LIKE AN AMERICAN COWBOY OF THEM ALL HIS WARMEST ADMIRER WAS HADDAN THE MAN SET TO WATCH HIM FOR THE SECRET SERVICE IT MAY BE TIMELY TO STATE THAT HADDAN WATCHED IN VAIN THE PRINCESS HUMORING HER OWN FANCY AS WELL AS BEVERLY'S FOIBLES
HOW CAN YOU EXPECT THE PARAGON TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU DEAR IF HE THINKS YOU ARE ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE YETIVE ASKED HER BLUE EYES BEAMING WITH THE FUN OF IT ALL POOH SNIFFED BEVERLY YOU HAVE ONLY TO CONSULT HISTORY TO FIND THE EXCUSE IT'S THE DEAR OLD HABIT OF MEN TO MAKE LOVE TO QUEENS AND GET BEHEADED FOR IT
ANYWAY I'LL SEND IT OUT TO THE COUNTY POLICE AND ASK THEM TO KEEP THEIR EYES OPEN
REVEALING A WIDE AND THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE AND EXTENSIVE INSPECTION HE HAD SEEN AMERICAN AS WELL AS EUROPEAN FORTIFICATIONS THE GRAUSTARK ENGINEERS WENT TO WORK AT ONCE TO PERFECT THE SIMPLE CHANGES HE ADVISED LEAVING NO STONE UNTURNED TO STRENGTHEN THE PLACE BEFORE AN ATTACK COULD BE MADE
DO QUINNOX I AM MOST CURIOUS BEVERLY SAT VERY STILL AND TENSE
AND PUFFING A RING OF SMOKE INTO THE AIR HE TOLD IN BARE UNADORNED FASHION THE EVENTS OF THE DAY IT HAS BEEN A NARROW THING FOR GRELL HE CONCLUDED EVEN NOW I FANCY WE SHALL GET HIM GREEN'S AS TENACIOUS AS A BULL DOG WHEN HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO TAKE HOLD OF
WHEN GREEN HAD GONE FOYLE GAVE A FEW INSTRUCTIONS TO COVER THE POINTS THAT HAD ARISEN AND WALKED TO SIR HILARY THORNTON'S ROOM THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LOOKED UP AND PROFFERED A CIGAR THINK OF THE ANGELS HE SAID I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW THINGS WERE GOING
MISS CALHOUN'S HORSE IN THE MEANTIME HAD CAUGHT THE FEVER HE PRANCED OFF TO THE ROADSIDE BEFORE SHE COULD GET HIM UNDER CONTROL SHE WAS THUS IN A POSITION TO OBSERVE THE TWO MEN ON THE GROUND SHIELDED FROM VIEW BY THE BODY OF THE HORSE THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO THE TRICK BALDOS HAD CLEVERLY WORKED
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I COULD HAVE SAVED IT SAID THE DETECTIVE REGRETFULLY AS IT IS IT'S OF NO USE AS EVIDENCE IN A COURT FOR IT ONLY RESTS ON MY WORD
BALDOS REFUSED TO BE PROPERLY DEPRESSED BY HIS MISFORTUNE HE RETIRED TO THE OBLIVION SHE PROVIDED AND SEEMED DISAGREEABLY CONTENT APPARENTLY IT MADE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO HIM WHETHER HE WAS IN OR OUT OF FAVOR BEVERLY WAS IN HIGH DUDGEON AND LOW SPIRITS
IN THE BARRACKS HE WAS ACQUIRING FAME REPORTS WENT FORTH WITH UNBIASED FREEDOM HE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS THE BEST SWORDSMAN IN THE SERVICE AS WELL AS THE MOST EFFICIENT MARKSMAN WITH THE FOILS AND SABERS HE EASILY VANQUISHED THE FOREMOST FENCERS IN HIGH AND LOW CIRCLES
I DON'T THINK IT LIKELY IT WOULD DOUBLE THE DANGER OF IDENTIFICATION BUT WE CAN SOON FIND IF SHE'S GONE BACK TO HER HOME I TOLD TAYLOR WHO IS WATCHING IN BERKELEY SQUARE TO REPORT WHEN SHE RETURNED HE TOUCHED A BELL AND PUT A QUESTION TO THE MAN WHO ENTERED YES SIR WAS THE REPLY HE RANG UP HALF AN HOUR AGO
AND ALSO SMASHED THREE BEFORE MY FATHER HAD THIS ONE MADE TO ORDER
THAT HE HAD BECOME IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO PROVE EMBARRASSING WHILE CONFESSING TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS A BIT TREACHEROUS AND WEAK SHE PROCEEDED TO IGNORE BALDOS WITH ASTONISHING PERSISTENCY APART FROM THE TEASING IT SEEMED TO HER OF LATE THAT HE WAS GROWING A SHADE TOO CONFIDENT
GRACE ANXIOUSLY SCANNED THE EXPANSE OF THE ICE IT WAS NEARLY A MILE TO THE OTHER END OF THE POND AND THE LAST GROUP OF SKATERS HAD DISAPPEARED OVER THE BROW OF THE HILL
