NOT I BUT SHE SHALL SUFFER THE MURDER I HAVE COMMITTED BECAUSE I AM FOREVER ROBBED OF ALL THAT SHE COULD GIVE ME SHE SHALL ATONE THE CRIME HAD ITS SOURCE IN HER
IF THEREFORE I COULD SEIZE HIM AND EDUCATE HIM AS MY COMPANION AND FRIEND I SHOULD NOT BE SO DESOLATE IN THIS PEOPLED EARTH URGED BY THIS IMPULSE I SEIZED ON THE BOY AS HE PASSED AND DREW HIM TOWARDS ME
WHICH YOU MUST NOT REFUSE TO CONCEDE THE LATTER PART OF HIS TALE HAD KINDLED ANEW IN ME THE ANGER THAT HAD DIED AWAY WHILE HE NARRATED HIS PEACEFUL LIFE AMONG THE COTTAGERS AND AS HE SAID THIS
HERE I PAUSED NOT EXACTLY KNOWING WHAT PATH TO PURSUE WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES
THAT YOU WERE MY FATHER MY CREATOR AND TO WHOM COULD I APPLY WITH MORE FITNESS THAN TO HIM WHO HAD GIVEN ME LIFE AMONG THE LESSONS THAT FELIX HAD BESTOWED UPON SAFIE GEOGRAPHY HAD NOT BEEN OMITTED
MY BELOVED AWAKE THE SLEEPER STIRRED A THRILL OF TERROR RAN THROUGH ME SHOULD SHE INDEED AWAKE AND SEE ME AND CURSE ME AND DENOUNCE THE MURDERER THUS
SUCH AS WOULD ALONE COMPENSATE FOR THE OUTRAGES AND ANGUISH I HAD ENDURED AFTER SOME WEEKS MY WOUND HEALED AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY
TO MEDITATE IN WHAT MANNER I SHOULD APPLY TO YOU I WAS OPPRESSED BY FATIGUE AND HUNGER AND FAR TOO UNHAPPY TO ENJOY THE GENTLE BREEZES OF EVENING OR THE PROSPECT OF THE SUN SETTING BEHIND THE STUPENDOUS MOUNTAINS OF JURA
BUT OF AN AGREEABLE ASPECT AND BLOOMING IN THE LOVELINESS OF YOUTH AND HEALTH HERE I THOUGHT IS ONE OF THOSE WHOSE JOY IMPARTING SMILES ARE BESTOWED ON ALL BUT ME AND THEN I BENT OVER HER AND WHISPERED
IT WAS APPARENT THAT MY CONVERSATION HAD INTERESTED THE FATHER IN MY BEHALF AND I WAS A FOOL IN HAVING EXPOSED MY PERSON TO THE HORROR OF HIS CHILDREN I OUGHT TO HAVE FAMILIARIZED THE OLD DE LACEY TO ME AND BY DEGREES
ALREADY SHOWN A DEGREE OF MALICE THAT SHOULD REASONABLY MAKE ME DISTRUST YOU MAY NOT EVEN THIS BE A FEINT THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR TRIUMPH BY AFFORDING A WIDER SCOPE FOR YOUR REVENGE HOW IS THIS
I COULD NO LONGER SUPPRESS THE RAGE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME I DO REFUSE IT I REPLIED AND NO TORTURE SHALL EVER EXTORT A CONSENT FROM ME YOU MAY RENDER ME THE MOST MISERABLE OF MEN BUT YOU SHALL NEVER MAKE ME BASE IN MY OWN EYES
AND ALL WITHIN ME WAS TURNED TO GALL AND BITTERNESS
AND A GUSH OF TEARS SOMEWHAT SOOTHED ME BUT AGAIN WHEN I REFLECTED THAT THEY HAD SPURNED AND DESERTED ME ANGER RETURNED A RAGE OF ANGER
ON YOUR SOLEMN OATH TO QUIT EUROPE FOREVER AND EVERY OTHER PLACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AS SOON AS I SHALL DELIVER INTO YOUR HANDS A FEMALE WHO WILL ACCOMPANY YOU IN YOUR EXILE I SWEAR HE CRIED BY THE SUN
OF PLEASURE BUT MY TOILS NOW DREW NEAR A CLOSE AND IN TWO MONTHS FROM THIS TIME I REACHED THE ENVIRONS OF GENEVA IT WAS EVENING WHEN I ARRIVED AND I RETIRED TO A HIDING PLACE AMONG THE FIELDS THAT SURROUND IT
AND PLACED THE PORTRAIT SECURELY IN ONE OF THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS SHE MOVED AGAIN AND I FLED FOR SOME DAYS I HAUNTED THE SPOT WHERE THESE SCENES HAD TAKEN PLACE
I GAZED ON MY VICTIM AND MY HEART SWELLED WITH EXULTATION AND HELLISH TRIUMPH CLAPPING MY HANDS I EXCLAIMED I TOO CAN CREATE DESOLATION MY ENEMY IS NOT INVULNERABLE
HE WILL PUNISH YOU YOU DARE NOT KEEP ME FRANKENSTEIN YOU BELONG THEN TO MY ENEMY TO HIM TOWARDS WHOM I HAVE SWORN ETERNAL REVENGE YOU SHALL BE MY FIRST VICTIM
TO HAVE DISCOVERED MYSELF TO THE REST OF HIS FAMILY WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR MY APPROACH
AND DID I NOT AS HIS MAKER OWE HIM ALL THE PORTION OF HAPPINESS THAT IT WAS IN MY POWER TO BESTOW
I HAD NO MEANS OF EXTRACTING IT MY SUFFERINGS WERE AUGMENTED ALSO BY THE OPPRESSIVE SENSE OF THE INJUSTICE AND INGRATITUDE OF THEIR INFLICTION MY DAILY VOWS ROSE FOR REVENGE A DEEP AND DEADLY REVENGE
IMMENSE RECESSES CONSUMED BY A BURNING PASSION WHICH YOU ALONE CAN GRATIFY WE MAY NOT PART UNTIL YOU HAVE PROMISED TO COMPLY WITH MY REQUISITION I AM ALONE AND MISERABLE
WHAT I ASK OF YOU IS REASONABLE AND MODERATE I DEMAND A CREATURE OF ANOTHER SEX BUT AS HIDEOUS AS MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION IS SMALL
AND TO SAVE THEM I RESOLVED TO DEDICATE MYSELF TO MY MOST ABHORRED TASK THE PROSPECT OF SUCH AN OCCUPATION MADE EVERY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF EXISTENCE PASS BEFORE ME LIKE A DREAM
AND CONTINUED IF YOU CONSENT NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING SHALL EVER SEE US AGAIN I WILL GO TO THE VAST WILDS OF SOUTH AMERICA MY FOOD IS NOT THAT OF MAN
THIS DEATH WILL CARRY DESPAIR TO HIM AND A THOUSAND OTHER MISERIES SHALL TORMENT AND DESTROY HIM AS I FIXED MY EYES ON THE CHILD I SAW SOMETHING GLITTERING ON HIS BREAST I TOOK IT
I WAS LIKE A WILD BEAST THAT HAD BROKEN THE TOILS DESTROYING THE OBJECTS THAT OBSTRUCTED ME AND RANGING THROUGH THE WOOD WITH A STAG LIKE SWIFTNESS OH WHAT A MISERABLE NIGHT I PASSED
WHY DID I LIVE WHY IN THAT INSTANT DID I NOT EXTINGUISH THE SPARK OF EXISTENCE WHICH YOU HAD SO WANTONLY BESTOWED I KNOW NOT
IF I CANNOT INSPIRE LOVE I WILL CAUSE FEAR AND CHIEFLY TOWARDS YOU MY ARCH ENEMY BECAUSE MY CREATOR DO I SWEAR INEXTINGUISHABLE HATRED HAVE A CARE
NATURE DECAYED AROUND ME AND THE SUN BECAME HEATLESS RAIN AND SNOW POURED AROUND ME MIGHTY RIVERS WERE FROZEN THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WAS HARD AND CHILL AND BARE
BE HERS THE PUNISHMENT THANKS TO THE LESSONS OF FELIX AND THE SANGUINARY LAWS OF MAN I HAD LEARNED NOW TO WORK MISCHIEF I BENT OVER HER
THE STARS SHONE AT INTERVALS AS THE CLOUDS PASSED FROM OVER THEM THE DARK PINES ROSE BEFORE ME AND EVERY HERE AND THERE A BROKEN TREE LAY ON THE GROUND IT WAS A SCENE OF WONDERFUL SOLEMNITY
I HAD NO RIGHT TO WITHHOLD FROM HIM THE SMALL PORTION OF HAPPINESS WHICH WAS YET IN MY POWER TO BESTOW YOU SWEAR I SAID TO BE HARMLESS BUT HAVE YOU NOT
AND THE SUFFERINGS I ENDURED INTENSE IT WAS LATE IN AUTUMN WHEN I QUITTED THE DISTRICT WHERE I HAD SO LONG RESIDED I TRAVELLED ONLY AT NIGHT FEARFUL OF ENCOUNTERING THE VISAGE OF A HUMAN BEING
SOMETIMES WISHING TO SEE YOU SOMETIMES RESOLVED TO QUIT THE WORLD AND ITS MISERIES FOREVER AT LENGTH I WANDERED TOWARDS THESE MOUNTAINS AND HAVE RANGED THROUGH THEIR
I CREPT FORTH FROM MY HIDING PLACE AND WENT IN SEARCH OF FOOD WHEN MY HUNGER WAS APPEASED I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE WELL KNOWN PATH THAT CONDUCTED TO THE COTTAGE ALL THERE WAS AT PEACE
INFLAMED BY PAIN I VOWED ETERNAL HATRED AND VENGEANCE TO ALL MANKIND BUT THE AGONY OF MY WOUND OVERCAME ME MY PULSES PAUSED AND I FAINTED
REVIVE WITHIN ME HALF SURPRISED BY THE NOVELTY OF THESE SENSATIONS I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THEM AND FORGETTING MY SOLITUDE AND DEFORMITY DARED TO BE HAPPY
I GENERALLY RESTED DURING THE DAY AND TRAVELLED ONLY WHEN I WAS SECURED BY NIGHT FROM THE VIEW OF MAN ONE MORNING HOWEVER FINDING THAT MY PATH LAY THROUGH A DEEP WOOD I VENTURED TO CONTINUE MY JOURNEY AFTER THE SUN HAD RISEN
THE COLD STARS SHONE IN MOCKERY AND THE BARE TREES WAVED THEIR BRANCHES ABOVE ME NOW AND THEN THE SWEET VOICE OF A BIRD BURST FORTH AMIDST THE UNIVERSAL STILLNESS ALL
AND HER LOVELY LIPS BUT PRESENTLY MY RAGE RETURNED I REMEMBERED THAT I WAS FOREVER DEPRIVED OF THE DELIGHTS THAT SUCH BEAUTIFUL CREATURES COULD BESTOW AND THAT SHE WHOSE RESEMBLANCE I CONTEMPLATED WOULD IN REGARDING ME
NECESSARILY ARISE WHEN I LIVE IN COMMUNION WITH AN EQUAL I SHALL FEEL THE AFFECTIONS OF A SENSITIVE BEING AND BECOME LINKED TO THE CHAIN OF EXISTENCE AND EVENTS FROM WHICH I AM NOW EXCLUDED
THESE THOUGHTS CALMED ME AND IN THE AFTERNOON I SANK INTO A PROFOUND SLEEP BUT THE FEVER OF MY BLOOD DID NOT ALLOW ME TO BE VISITED BY PEACEFUL DREAMS THE HORRIBLE SCENE OF THE PRECEDING DAY WAS
BUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE READY I SHALL APPEAR SAYING THIS HE SUDDENLY QUITTED ME FEARFUL PERHAPS OF ANY CHANGE IN MY SENTIMENTS I SAW HIM DESCEND THE MOUNTAIN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN THE FLIGHT OF AN EAGLE
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FEELINGS OF REVENGE AND HATRED FILLED MY BOSOM AND I DID NOT STRIVE TO CONTROL THEM BUT ALLOWING MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THE STREAM I BENT MY MIND TOWARDS INJURY AND DEATH
AND I FOUND NO SHELTER OH EARTH HOW OFTEN DID I IMPRECATE CURSES ON THE CAUSE OF MY BEING
SUDDENLY AS I GAZED ON HIM AN IDEA SEIZED ME THAT THIS LITTLE CREATURE WAS UNPREJUDICED AND HAD LIVED TOO SHORT A TIME TO HAVE IMBIBED A HORROR OF DEFORMITY
ACCORDINGLY I HID MYSELF IN SOME THICK UNDERWOOD DETERMINING TO DEVOTE THE ENSUING HOURS TO REFLECTION ON MY SITUATION THE PLEASANT SUNSHINE AND THE PURE AIR OF DAY RESTORED ME TO SOME DEGREE OF TRANQUILLITY
BUT I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW THE ETERNAL TWINKLING OF THE STARS WEIGHED UPON ME AND HOW I LISTENED TO EVERY BLAST OF WIND AS IF IT WERE A DULL UGLY SIROC ON ITS WAY TO CONSUME ME MORNING DAWNED BEFORE I ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE OF
I TOOK NO REST BUT RETURNED IMMEDIATELY TO GENEVA EVEN IN MY OWN HEART I COULD GIVE NO EXPRESSION TO MY SENSATIONS THEY WEIGHED ON ME WITH A MOUNTAIN'S WEIGHT AND THEIR EXCESS DESTROYED MY AGONY BENEATH THEM
IT WAS A PORTRAIT OF A MOST LOVELY WOMAN IN SPITE OF MY MALIGNITY IT SOFTENED AND ATTRACTED ME FOR A FEW MOMENTS I GAZED WITH DELIGHT ON HER DARK EYES
I SANK TO THE GROUND AND MY INJURER WITH INCREASED SWIFTNESS ESCAPED INTO THE WOOD THIS
THE SUN WILL SHINE ON US AS ON MAN AND WILL RIPEN OUR FOOD THE PICTURE I PRESENT TO YOU IS PEACEFUL AND HUMAN AND YOU MUST FEEL THAT YOU COULD DENY IT ONLY IN THE WANTONNESS OF POWER AND CRUELTY
AND FIXING MY FEET FIRMLY AS I ADVANCED PERPLEXED ME OCCUPIED AS I WAS BY THE EMOTIONS WHICH THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY HAD PRODUCED NIGHT WAS FAR ADVANCED WHEN I CAME TO THE HALFWAY RESTING PLACE AND SEATED MYSELF BESIDE THE FOUNTAIN
WHISPERED CATHERINE DETACHING HER FRIEND FROM JAMES IT IS MISTER TILNEY'S SISTER
THE TONES STRUCK FAMILIARLY ON MISTER CARLYLE'S EAR HE DREW BACK MECHANICALLY A THOUSAND PERPLEXING SENSATIONS OVERWHELMING HIM AND THE MAN FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE ROOM A WHITE MAN AS LUCY CALLED HER FATHER
NOW THAT I HAVE GOT OVER MY PASSION FOR AFY I CAN SEE HER FAULTS MISTER CARLYLE SHE'D NO MORE TELL AN UNTRUTH THAN I SHOULD STICK A MOST AWFUL THUNDERING AT THE ROOM DOOR
I TELL MISTER ALLEN WHEN HE TALKS OF BEING SICK OF IT THAT I AM SURE HE SHOULD NOT COMPLAIN FOR IT IS SO VERY AGREEABLE A PLACE THAT IT IS MUCH BETTER TO BE HERE THAN AT HOME AT THIS DULL TIME OF YEAR
HE IS A VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN INDEED HE IS MISSUS ALLEN SAID MISSUS THORPE SMILING COMPLACENTLY I MUST SAY IT THOUGH I AM HIS MOTHER THAT THERE IS NOT A MORE AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD
I SHALL FIX MYSELF IN SOME OTHER BIG TOWN FAR AWAY FROM LONDON LIVERPOOL OR MANCHESTER PERHAPS AND SEE WHAT EMPLOYMENT I CAN GET INTO
BUT SHE HAD NOT LOOKED ROUND LONG BEFORE SHE SAW HIM LEADING A YOUNG LADY TO THE DANCE AH HE HAS GOT A PARTNER I WISH HE HAD ASKED YOU SAID MISSUS ALLEN AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE SHE ADDED
I WANT TO KNOW YOUR NAME I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME AT PRESENT HE FLEW INTO A PASSION AND SWORE THAT IF EVER HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ME NEAR HIM AGAIN HE WOULD HAND ME OVER INTO CUSTODY
TALKING TO A CAB DRIVER WHEN SOME DROPS OF RAIN CAME DOWN A GENTLEMAN AND LADY WERE PASSING AT THE TIME BUT I HAD NOT PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THEM BY JOVE I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM TO HER I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEPPER
THIS INAPPLICABLE ANSWER MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH FOR THE COMPREHENSION OF MANY BUT IT DID NOT PUZZLE MISSUS ALLEN FOR AFTER ONLY A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION SHE SAID IN A WHISPER TO CATHERINE
THE EXCEEDINGLY COMFORTABLE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER AND THE LIGHT OF THE CHANDELIER WHICH FELL ON ALL PRESENTED A PICTURE OF HOME PEACE THOUGH IT MAY NOT HAVE DESERVED THE NAME OF LUXURY WITHOUT
FIRED RICHARD IT WAS THORN RICHARD YOU CANNOT TELL
HE HAD NOT BEHAVED HE HAD NOT TALKED LIKE THE MARRIED MEN TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN USED HE HAD NEVER MENTIONED A WIFE AND HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED A SISTER FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SPRANG THE INSTANT CONCLUSION OF HIS SISTER'S NOW BEING BY HIS SIDE
RICHARD UTTERED MISTER CARLYLE I AM THUNDERSTRUCK
WERE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BY A LADY AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS THORPE
AFY WAS HERE HERSELF TWO OR THREE MONTHS AGO WAS SHE THOUGH UTTERED RICHARD BEGUILED FOR AN INSTANT FROM THE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN DANGER WHAT IS SHE DOING SHE IS IN SERVICE AS A LADY'S MAID
WE HAD BETTER TAKE A CAB MY DEAR WITH THAT THE MAN I WAS TALKING TO SWUNG OPEN THE DOOR OF HIS CAB AND SHE GOT IN SUCH A FAIR YOUNG LADY SHE WAS I TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM
WAS VERY IMPORTUNATE WITH ISABELLA TO STAND UP BUT JOHN WAS GONE INTO THE CARD ROOM TO SPEAK TO A FRIEND AND NOTHING SHE DECLARED
MADE HER WAY TO MISSUS ALLEN AND MISSUS THORPE AS FAST AS SHE COULD
THAT YOU HAVE NEVER DROPPED UPON HIM PREVIOUSLY INTERRUPTED MISTER CARLYLE NO SIR AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO SHOW MYSELF IN THOSE LATTER PARTS OF THE TOWN FEARING I MIGHT MEET WITH SOME ONE I USED TO KNOW AT HOME
I DIE TO SEE HIM MISTER MORLAND YOU ARE NOT TO LISTEN WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS WHISPERING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE NOW I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE
LET ME LOOK AT HER THIS MOMENT WHAT A DELIGHTFUL GIRL I NEVER SAW ANYTHING HALF SO BEAUTIFUL BUT WHERE IS HER ALL CONQUERING BROTHER IS HE IN THE ROOM
COME ALONG MY DEAREST CATHERINE FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE AND STAND BY ME AND OFF THEY WENT TO REGAIN THEIR FORMER PLACE JOHN THORPE IN THE MEANWHILE HAD WALKED AWAY AND CATHERINE EVER WILLING TO GIVE MISTER TILNEY AN OPPORTUNITY
WE DIDN'T GO MUCH MORE THAN THE LENGTH OF A STREET I WAS ON THE PAVEMENT BEFORE THORN WAS AND LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN HE WENT WHITE I MARKED THE HOUSE THINKING IT WAS WHERE HE LIVED AND
SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS I HAD NO MONEY TO PAY FOR A LODGING
I DARE SAY SHE THOUGHT I WAS SPEAKING OF HER SON CATHERINE WAS DISAPPOINTED AND VEXED SHE SEEMED TO HAVE MISSED BY SO LITTLE THE VERY OBJECT SHE HAD HAD IN VIEW
CATHERINE HAD FORTITUDE TOO SHE SUFFERED BUT NO MURMUR PASSED HER LIPS FROM THIS STATE OF HUMILIATION SHE WAS ROUSED AT THE END OF TEN MINUTES
AGAIN I SAW HIM STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE BETTING ROOMS TALKING TO THE SAME GENTLEMAN AND HIS FACE TURNED SAVAGE I BELIEVE WITH FEAR AS MUCH AS ANGER WHEN HE DISCERNED ME HE SEEMED TO HESITATE AND THEN AS IF HE ACTED IN A PASSION
HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HER SUFFERINGS RATHER TOO ACUTE THE VERY EASY MANNER IN WHICH HE THEN TOLD HER THAT HE HAD KEPT HER WAITING DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RECONCILE HER MORE TO HER LOT NOR DID THE PARTICULARS WHICH HE ENTERED INTO WHILE THEY WERE STANDING UP
VERY AGREEABLE MADAM I AM GLAD OF IT JOHN HAS CHARMING SPIRITS HAS NOT HE DID YOU MEET MISTER TILNEY MY DEAR SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WHERE IS HE
BY WHOM HE WAS VERY CIVILLY ACKNOWLEDGED I AM VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN SIR INDEED I WAS AFRAID YOU HAD LEFT BATH HE THANKED HER FOR HER FEARS
AND HIS OWN LIGHT HAIR BRISTLING UP WITH HORROR STRUGGLED INTO HIS WET SMOCK FROCK AFTER A FASHION THE TAILS UP ABOUT HIS EARS AND THE SLEEVES HANGING FORCED ON HIS HAT AND HIS FALSE WHISKERS LOOKED ROUND IN A BEWILDERED MANNER
SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING VEXED AT THE NON APPEARANCE OF MISTER THORPE FOR SHE NOT ONLY LONGED TO BE DANCING BUT WAS LIKEWISE AWARE THAT AS THE REAL DIGNITY OF HER SITUATION COULD NOT BE KNOWN
HE MAY HAVE BROUGHT HALF A DOZEN MORE WITH HIM GASPED THE UNHAPPY RICHARD I SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE DODGED ME ALL THE WAY HERE NONSENSE SIT YOU DOWN AND BE AT REST IT IS ONLY CORNELIA
MY SWEET CATHERINE DO SUPPORT ME PERSUADE YOUR BROTHER HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS TELL HIM THAT IT WOULD QUITE SHOCK YOU TO SEE ME DO SUCH A THING NOW WOULD NOT IT NO NOT AT ALL
FOR SOME CUPBOARD OR MOUSE HOLE INTO WHICH HE MIGHT CREEP AND SEEING NONE RUSHED TO THE FIREPLACE AND PLACED HIS FOOT ON THE FENDER THAT HE PURPOSED AN ATTEMPT AT CHIMNEY CLIMBING WAS EVIDENT THOUGH HOW THE FIRE WOULD HAVE AGREED WITH HIS PANTALOONS
BUT HAPPENING TO GLANCE INTO THE STREET THERE I SAW THE MAN AGAIN STANDING OPPOSITE AND RECONNOITERING THE HOUSE I HAD GONE HOME HUNGRY BUT THIS TOOK ALL MY HUNGER AWAY FROM ME I OPENED THE BOX WHERE I KEPT MY DISGUISE
I DON'T POSSESS A PENNY PIECE HE ADDED DRAWING OUT HIS TROUSERS POCKETS FOR THE INSPECTION OF MISTER CARLYLE THE LAST COPPERS I HAD THREE PENCE I SPENT IN BREAD AND CHEESE AND HALF A PINT OF BEER AT MIDDAY
MISS TILNEY EXPRESSING A PROPER SENSE OF SUCH GOODNESS MISS MORLAND WITH THE REAL DELICACY OF A GENEROUS MIND MAKING LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION
MY DEAREST CREATURE I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU THIS HOUR WHAT COULD INDUCE YOU TO COME INTO THIS SET
OUR TWO DANCES ARE OVER AND BESIDES I AM TIRED AND DO NOT MEAN TO DANCE ANY MORE DO NOT YOU THEN LET US WALK ABOUT AND QUIZ PEOPLE COME ALONG WITH ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU THE FOUR GREATEST QUIZZERS IN THE ROOM
WELL I COULD NOT REST I WAS HALF MAD I SAY AND WENT ABOUT STILL TRYING IF I COULD NOT DISCOVER HIS NAME AND WHO HE WAS I DID COME UPON HIM BUT HE WAS WALKING QUICKLY ARM IN ARM WITH WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN
AND TURNING ROUND PERCEIVED MISSUS HUGHES DIRECTLY BEHIND HER ATTENDED BY MISS TILNEY AND A GENTLEMAN I BEG YOUR PARDON MISS MORLAND SAID SHE FOR THIS LIBERTY BUT I CANNOT ANYHOW GET TO MISS THORPE
PRODUCED SEVERE MORTIFICATION TO THE LADY AND IN GIVING HER DENIAL SHE EXPRESSED HER SORROW ON THE OCCASION SO VERY MUCH AS IF SHE REALLY FELT IT THAT HAD THORPE WHO JOINED HER JUST AFTERWARDS BEEN HALF A MINUTE EARLIER
DROP UPON YOU THERE WAS A LITTLE PARTITION IN THE WINDOW CURTAIN IT HAD NOT BEEN DRAWN CLOSE AND THROUGH IT I COULD SEE YOU AND MISS CARLYLE I SAW HER LEAVE THE ROOM I SAW YOU COME TO THE WINDOW AND OPEN IT AND THEN I SPOKE
AND YOU MIGHT JUST HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH ASTONISHMENT MISTER CARLYLE IT WAS THE MAN THORN INDEED YOU THOUGHT I MIGHT BE MISTAKEN IN HIM THAT MOONLIGHT NIGHT
BUT ALL IN VAIN HE WOULD NOT STIR AN INCH WAS NOT IT SO MISTER MORLAND BUT YOU MEN ARE ALL SO IMMODERATELY LAZY
I'M SURE I HAVE BEEN FREE ENOUGH ALL MY LIFE FROM REQUIRING SUCH SICK DISHES DO SO SAID MISTER CARLYLE IT MAY DO YOU GOOD
AND THIS PERSUASION DID NOT INCLINE HER TO A VERY GRACIOUS REPLY WHEN JOHN THORPE CAME UP TO HER SOON AFTERWARDS AND SAID WELL MISS MORLAND I SUPPOSE YOU AND I ARE TO STAND UP AND JIG IT TOGETHER AGAIN OH NO I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
HAD TOO MUCH GOOD NATURE TO MAKE ANY OPPOSITION AND THE OTHERS RISING UP ISABELLA HAD ONLY TIME TO PRESS HER FRIEND'S HAND AND SAY GOOD BYE MY DEAR LOVE BEFORE THEY HURRIED OFF
BUT IF YOU THINK IT WRONG YOU HAD MUCH BETTER CHANGE THERE CRIED ISABELLA YOU HEAR WHAT YOUR SISTER SAYS AND YET YOU WILL NOT MIND HER
OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO POINT OUT THE DISCREPANCY AND TO INQUIRE HOW SHE COULD RECONCILE IT YET HER ASSERTION TO HIM HAD BEEN MOST POSITIVE AND SOLEMN THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE MATTER WHICH HE COULD NOT RECONCILE
HEAVY FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FALLING THICKLY FLAKES AS LARGE AND NEARLY AS HEAVY AS A CROWN PIECE RENDERING THE ATMOSPHERE SO DENSE AND OBSCURE THAT A MAN COULD NOT SEE A YARD BEFORE HIM MISTER CARLYLE HAD DRIVEN HOME IN THE PONY CARRIAGE
AS THEY HAD AGREED TO JOIN THEIR PARTY THIS WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE MISTER TILNEY STILL CONTINUING STANDING BEFORE THEM AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES CONSIDERATION HE ASKED CATHERINE TO DANCE WITH HIM THIS COMPLIMENT DELIGHTFUL AS IT WAS
OR ANY OTHER LARGE PIECE OF FLANNEL YOU MAY CONVENIENTLY HAVE AT HAND AND PUT IT ON OVER YOUR NIGHT CAP I'LL TRY IT I WOULD SAID MISTER CARLYLE SMOTHERING AN IRREVERENT LAUGH
ALL I WISH IT HAD BEEN ALL I KEPT LOOKING ABOUT FOR HIM IN ALL THE BEST STREETS I WAS HALF MAD DO YOU NOT WONDER IF HE IS IN THIS POSITION OF LIFE AND RESIDES IN LONDON
YES SIR AND DOCTOR SKINNER AND HIS FAMILY WERE HERE THREE MONTHS SO I TELL MISTER ALLEN HE MUST NOT BE IN A HURRY TO GET AWAY
AND IT LIES SO DEEP IN PLACES THAT YOU HAVE TO COME ALONG AT A SNAIL'S PACE BUT I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THIS BUSINESS
AND THE SNOW HAD SO SETTLED UPON HIM THAT LUCY WHO HAPPENED TO SEE HIM AS HE ENTERED THE HALL SCREAMED OUT LAUGHINGLY
SUDDENLY BECKONED TO A POLICEMAN POINTED ME OUT AND SAID SOMETHING TO HIM IN A FAST TONE THAT FRIGHTENED ME AND I SLIPPED AWAY TWO HOURS AFTER WHEN I WAS IN QUITE A DIFFERENT PART OF THE TOWN IN TURNING MY HEAD I SAW THE SAME POLICEMAN FOLLOWING ME
SET ON BY THAT WRETCH THORN MISTER CARLYLE TURNED TO THE SIDEBOARD AND POURED OUT A WINEGLASS OF BRANDY DRINK IT RICHARD IT WILL WARM YOU I'D RATHER HAVE IT IN SOME HOT WATER SIR
THAT IS TRUE INDIRECTLY BUT NOT DIRECTLY HOW DO YOU MEAN PROFESSOR I ASKED I WAS A LITTLE INCLINED TO TAKE HIS SERIOUSNESS LIGHTLY FOR AFTER ALL
AND WHEN WE HAD SUPPED SHE TOLD ME OF VAN HELSING'S VISIT AND OF HER HAVING GIVEN HIM THE TWO DIARIES COPIED OUT AND OF HOW ANXIOUS SHE HAS BEEN ABOUT ME SHE SHOWED ME IN THE DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT ALL I WROTE DOWN WAS TRUE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A NEW MAN OF ME
AND THAT LET ME TELL YOU IS MUCH IN THIS AGE SO SCEPTICAL AND SELFISH AND YOU SIR I HAVE READ ALL THE LETTERS TO POOR MISS LUCY AND SOME OF THEM SPEAK OF YOU SO I KNOW YOU SINCE SOME DAYS FROM THE KNOWING OF OTHERS

AND SO NOW WE SHALL NOT SPEAK OF IT LEST IT DISTRESS I SHALL STAY IN EXETER TO NIGHT FOR I WANT TO THINK MUCH OVER WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME AND WHEN I HAVE THOUGHT I WILL ASK YOU QUESTIONS IF I MAY AND THEN TOO
THAT AWFUL JOURNAL GETS HOLD OF MY IMAGINATION AND TINGES EVERYTHING WITH SOMETHING OF ITS OWN COLOUR OF COURSE IT IS ABOUT LUCY THAT HABIT CAME BACK TO THE POOR DEAR AND THAT AWFUL NIGHT ON THE CLIFF MUST HAVE MADE HER ILL
I ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED TO SEE ME ABOUT SO HE AT ONCE BEGAN I HAVE READ YOUR LETTERS TO MISS LUCY FORGIVE ME BUT I HAD TO BEGIN TO INQUIRE SOMEWHERE AND THERE WAS NONE TO ASK I KNOW THAT YOU WERE WITH HER AT WHITBY
THAT YOU MUST BE ABLE TO PUT DOWN EXACTLY ALMOST EVERY WORD SPOKEN EVEN IF YOU HAD TO REFINE SOME OF IT AFTERWARDS HERE WAS A RARE INTERVIEW I SHALL TRY TO RECORD IT VERBATIM
AND I HAVE READ YOUR DIARY THAT YOU HAVE SO GOODLY WRITTEN FOR ME AND WHICH BREATHES OUT TRUTH IN EVERY LINE I WHO HAVE READ YOUR SO SWEET LETTER TO POOR LUCY OF YOUR MARRIAGE AND YOUR TRUST NOT KNOW YOU

IT WAS SO FUNNY TO HEAR MY WIFE CALLED MADAM MINA BY THIS KINDLY STRONG FACED OLD MAN I SMILED AND SAID I WAS ILL I HAVE HAD A SHOCK BUT YOU HAVE CURED ME ALREADY AND HOW
AND REJECT THE THOUGHT READING LET ME TELL YOU MY FRIEND THAT THERE ARE THINGS DONE TO DAY IN ELECTRICAL SCIENCE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED UNHOLY BY THE VERY MEN WHO DISCOVERED ELECTRICITY
AND THRUST LAST NIGHT'S WESTMINSTER GAZETTE INTO MY HAND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT HE ASKED AS HE STOOD BACK AND FOLDED HIS ARMS I LOOKED OVER THE PAPER FOR I REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
I FEEL LIKE A NOVICE LUMBERING THROUGH A BOG IN A MIST JUMPING FROM ONE TUSSOCK TO ANOTHER IN THE MERE BLIND EFFORT TO MOVE ON WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE I AM GOING
I HAD A LETTER FROM ARTHUR WRITTEN ON SUNDAY AND FROM IT I GATHER
MADAM MINA IT IS ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEAD I COME SIR I SAID YOU COULD HAVE NO BETTER CLAIM ON ME THAN THAT YOU WERE A FRIEND AND HELPER OF LUCY WESTENRA AND I HELD OUT MY HAND
BY THIS TIME MY LITTLE JOKE WAS OVER AND I WAS ALMOST ASHAMED SO I TOOK THE TYPEWRITTEN COPY FROM MY WORKBASKET AND HANDED IT TO HIM FORGIVE ME I SAID I COULD NOT HELP IT BUT

AND THE FEAR THAT HAS BEEN BROODING OVER ME EVER SINCE ALL CAME IN A TUMULT I SUPPOSE I WAS HYSTERICAL FOR I THREW MYSELF ON MY KNEES AND HELD UP MY HANDS TO HIM AND IMPLORED HIM TO MAKE MY HUSBAND WELL AGAIN
AND OH I AM REJOICED THAT HE IS NOT NOW WEIGHED DOWN WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HIS NEW POSITION I KNEW HE WOULD BE TRUE TO HIMSELF AND NOW HOW PROUD I AM TO SEE MY JONATHAN RISING TO THE HEIGHT OF HIS ADVANCEMENT
SO SOON I DO NOT THINK HE REMEMBERED ME AT THE MOMENT JUST THEN THE WHISTLE BLEW AND THE TRAIN MOVED OFF THIS RECALLED HIM TO HIMSELF AND HE LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND WAVED HIS HAND CALLING OUT LOVE TO MADAM MINA
TELL ME I SAID I CAN HAZARD NO OPINION I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK AND I HAVE NO DATA ON WHICH TO FOUND A CONJECTURE
TILL ON DESCENDING HE COULD DRINK THE OIL OF ALL THE CHURCH LAMPS CAN YOU TELL ME WHY IN THE PAMPAS AY AND ELSEWHERE

WE SHALL BOTH COME WHEN YOU WILL I SAID I HAD GOT HIM THE MORNING PAPERS AND THE LONDON PAPERS OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND WHILE WE WERE TALKING AT THE CARRIAGE WINDOW WAITING FOR THE TRAIN TO START HE WAS TURNING THEM OVER HIS EYES SUDDENLY SEEMED TO CATCH SOMETHING IN ONE OF THEM THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE

JONATHAN WILL BE HERE AT HALF PAST ELEVEN AND YOU MUST COME TO LUNCH WITH US AND SEE HIM THEN YOU COULD CATCH THE QUICK THREE THIRTY FOUR TRAIN WHICH WILL LEAVE YOU AT PADDINGTON BEFORE EIGHT HE WAS SURPRISED AT MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRAINS OFF HAND
IS ALL THAT FEVER GONE AND IS HE STRONG AND HEARTY I SAW HERE AN OPENING TO ASK HIM ABOUT JONATHAN SO I SAID HE WAS ALMOST RECOVERED BUT HE HAS BEEN GREATLY UPSET
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CRIED HE THREW HIMSELF WITH A DESPAIRING GESTURE INTO A CHAIR AND PLACED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS AS HE SPOKE
WELL I SHALL TELL YOU MY THESIS IS THIS I WANT YOU TO BELIEVE TO BELIEVE WHAT TO BELIEVE IN THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT
THAT IS THE REASON OF HIS COMING IT IS CONCERNING LUCY AND HER SLEEP WALKING AND NOT ABOUT JONATHAN THEN I SHALL NEVER KNOW THE REAL TRUTH NOW HOW SILLY I AM

DOUBTED IF HE WERE REALLY WIDOWED AND THEN WITH THE MOVEMENT OF AN ARM A FOOT HE WOULD ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS ALONE IN HIS HOLLAND NEVERTHELESS THE TALK CONTINUED IT WAS TERRIBLE TO BE THUS HAUNTED BY A VOICE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT FIFTY TWO EIGHTEENPENCES COME TO IN A YEAR
YOU'LL BE COMING HOME TIPSY EVERY NIGHT AND TUMBLING DOWN AND BREAKING YOUR LEG AND PUTTING OUT YOUR SHOULDER AND BRINGING ALL SORTS OF DISGRACE AND EXPENSE UPON US

THAT HE HAD HIVED ALL HER SAYINGS IN HIS BRAIN AND FURTHER THAT HE EMPLOYED THE MELLOW EVENING OF HIS LIFE TO PUT SUCH SAYINGS DOWN THAT IN DUE SEASON THEY MIGHT BE ENSHRINED IN IMPERISHABLE TYPE
IN A LITTLE TIME YOU'LL HAVE A FACE ALL OVER AS IF IT WAS MADE OF RED CURRANT JAM AND I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO'S TO ENDURE YOU THEN I WON'T AND SO DON'T THINK IT DON'T COME TO ME NICE HABITS MEN LEARN AT CLUBS
YOU WON'T WANT SODA AND YOU WON'T WANT BROTH ALL THE BETTER YOU WOULDN'T GET EM IF YOU DID I CAN ASSURE YOU DEAR DEAR DEAR THAT FILTHY TOBACCO I'M SURE IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE ME AS BAD AS YOU ARE
HE LIVED THIRTY YEARS WITH MISSUS CAUDLE SURVIVING HER YES IT TOOK THIRTY YEARS FOR MISSUS CAUDLE TO LECTURE AND DILATE UPON THE JOYS GRIEFS DUTIES AND VICISSITUDES COMPRISED WITHIN THAT SEEMINGLY SMALL CIRCLE
FROM ELEVEN AT NIGHT UNTIL SEVEN IN THE MORNING THERE WAS NO RETREAT FOR HIM HE WAS COMPELLED TO LIE AND LISTEN PERHAPS THERE WAS LITTLE MAGNANIMITY IN THIS ON THE PART OF MISSUS CAUDLE
YOU DON'T SEE IT'S RED NO I DARESAY NOT BUT I SEE IT I SEE A GREAT MANY THINGS YOU DON'T AND SO YOU'LL GO ON IN A LITTLE TIME WITH YOUR BRANDY AND WATER DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU ONLY TAKE TWO SMALL GLASSES
HE WAS PERHAPS IN MORE RESPECTS THAN ONE ALL EARS AND THESE EARS MISSUS CAUDLE HIS LAWFUL WEDDED WIFE AS SHE WOULD EVER AND ANON IMPRESS UPON HIM FOR SHE WAS NOT A WOMAN TO WEAR CHAINS WITHOUT SHAKING THEM
YOU'RE NOT A DRUNKARD NO BUT YOU WILL BE IT'S ALL THE SAME YOU'VE BEGUN BY STAYING OUT TILL MIDNIGHT BY AND BY TWILL BE ALL NIGHT BUT DON'T YOU THINK MISTER CAUDLE YOU SHALL EVER HAVE A KEY I KNOW YOU
NO I WON'T GO TO SLEEP AND I'M NOT TALKING OF WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE I KNOW IT WILL ALL HAPPEN EVERY BIT OF IT IF IT WASN'T FOR THE DEAR CHILDREN YOU MIGHT BE RUINED AND I WOULDN'T SO MUCH AS SPEAK ABOUT IT BUT
TOOK WHOLE AND SOLE POSSESSION OF THEY WERE HER ENTIRE PROPERTY AS EXPRESSLY MADE TO CONVEY TO CAUDLE'S BRAIN THE STREAM OF WISDOM THAT CONTINUALLY FLOWED FROM THE LIPS OF HIS WIFE
FOR THEY SHALL LIE UNDER MY PILLOW UNDER MY OWN HEAD MISTER CAUDLE
THE DOG WOULD COME HOME AND BITE US ALL MAD THE SHUTTER WOULD GO BANGING FOR EVER THE SOOT WOULD ALWAYS FALL THE MICE NEVER LET US HAVE A WINK OF SLEEP THIEVES BE ALWAYS BREAKING IN THE HOUSE OUR DEAR MARY ANNE BE FOR EVER LEFT AN UNPROTECTED MAID
AND AFTER WE'VE INSURED FOR SO MANY YEARS BUT HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW ARE PEOPLE TO INSURE WHO MAKE DUCKS AND DRAKES OF THEIR FIVE POUNDS I DID THINK WE MIGHT GO TO MARGATE THIS SUMMER
YES YOU'D DO EXACTLY LIKE THAT PRETTYMAN AND WHAT DID HE DO ONLY LAST WEDNESDAY WHY HE LET HIMSELF IN ABOUT FOUR IN THE MORNING AND BROUGHT HOME WITH HIM HIS POT COMPANION PUFFY HIS DEAR WIFE WOKE AT SIX
TO DIGEST HER LESSONS IN THE BROAD DAY BESIDES SHE COULD NEVER MAKE SURE OF HIM HE WAS ALWAYS LIABLE TO BE SUMMONED TO THE SHOP NOW
THE MORE SHAME FOR EM SKYLARKS INDEED THEY SHOULD CALL THEMSELVES VULTURES FOR THEY CAN ONLY DO AS THEY DO BY EATING UP THEIR INNOCENT WIVES AND CHILDREN EIGHTEENPENCE A WEEK AND IF IT WAS ONLY THAT
BUT I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO I KNOW IT'S NO USE MISTER CAUDLE YOUR CALLING ME A GOOD CREATURE I'M NOT SUCH A FOOL AS TO BE COAXED IN THAT WAY NO IF YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP YOU SHOULD COME HOME IN CHRISTIAN TIME NOT AT HALF PAST TWELVE
AT LENGTH THE MARAUDER IS DETECTED SEIZED BY HIS OWNER AND DRIVEN BEATEN HOME TO MAKE THE PORKER LESS DANGEROUS IT IS DETERMINED THAT HE SHALL BE RINGED THE SENTENCE IS PRONOUNCED EXECUTION ORDERED
PERISH THE HYPERBOLE WE WOULD RATHER COMPARE IT TO AN ELFIN RING IN WHICH DANCING FAIRIES MADE THE SWEETEST MUSIC FOR INFIRM HUMANITY MANIFOLD ARE THE USES OF RINGS
IT MAY BE THE CAT BUT THIEVES ARE PRETTY SURE TO COME IN SOME NIGHT THERE'S A WRETCHED FASTENING TO THE BACK DOOR BUT THESE ARE NOT TIMES TO AFFORD BOLTS AND BARS WHEN PEOPLE WON'T TAKE CARE OF THEIR FIVE POUNDS
OR WORSE THAN A FOOLISH MAN YOU'RE A WICKED ONE IF YOU WERE TO DIE TO MORROW AND PEOPLE WHO GO TO PUBLIC HOUSES DO ALL THEY CAN TO SHORTEN THEIR LIVES I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO WOULD WRITE UPON YOUR TOMBSTONE
NEXT TUESDAY THE FIRE INSURANCE IS DUE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW IT'S TO BE PAID WHY IT CAN'T BE PAID AT ALL THAT FIVE POUNDS WOULD HAVE MORE THAN DONE IT AND NOW INSURANCE IS OUT OF THE QUESTION
BUT YOU ALWAYS WERE A FOOL MISTER CAUDLE I'VE WANTED A BLACK SATIN GOWN THESE THREE YEARS AND THAT FIVE POUNDS WOULD HAVE ENTIRELY BOUGHT IT BUT IT'S NO MATTER HOW I GO NOT AT ALL EVERYBODY SAYS I DON'T DRESS AS BECOMES YOUR WIFE
AND BE KNOCKING DOWN SOME OF THE POLICE AND THEN I KNOW WHAT WILL FOLLOW IT MUST FOLLOW YES YOU'LL BE SENT FOR A MONTH OR SIX WEEKS TO THE TREADMILL PRETTY THING THAT FOR A RESPECTABLE TRADESMAN MISTER CAUDLE TO BE PUT UPON THE TREADMILL WITH
NOW IF I WAS TO GO AND LEAVE YOU AND THE CHILDREN A PRETTY NOISE THERE'D BE YOU HOWEVER CAN GO AND SMOKE NO END OF PIPES AND YOU DIDN'T SMOKE IT'S ALL THE SAME MISTER CAUDLE IF YOU GO AMONG SMOKING PEOPLE FOLKS ARE KNOWN BY THEIR COMPANY
SO WAS MISSUS CAUDLE LIKE THE OWL SHE HOOTED ONLY AT NIGHT MISTER CAUDLE WAS BLESSED WITH AN INDOMITABLE CONSTITUTION ONE FACT WILL PROVE THE TRUTH OF THIS
FOR A PARCEL OF POT COMPANIONS OH IT'S DISGRACEFUL MISTER CAUDLE IT'S UNFEELING NO MAN WHO HAD THE LEAST LOVE FOR HIS WIFE COULD DO IT AND I SUPPOSE THIS IS TO BE THE CASE EVERY SATURDAY
A TENDER HUSBAND AND AN AFFECTIONATE FATHER I I'D HAVE NO SUCH FALSEHOODS TOLD OF YOU I CAN ASSURE YOU GOING AND SPENDING YOUR MONEY AND NONSENSE DON'T TELL ME NO IF YOU WERE TEN TIMES TO SWEAR IT
IT'S VERY WELL FOR YOU TO SAY SO BUT I KNOW YOU WILL AND THEN YOU MAY NURSE YOURSELF FOR ME HA THAT FILTHY TOBACCO AGAIN NO I SHALL NOT GO TO SLEEP LIKE A GOOD SOUL
THERE'S POOR LITTLE CAROLINE I'M SURE SHE WANTS THE SEA BUT NO DEAR CREATURE SHE MUST STOP AT HOME ALL OF US MUST STOP AT HOME SHE'LL GO INTO A CONSUMPTION THERE'S NO DOUBT OF THAT YES SWEET LITTLE ANGEL
AND THEN IN WHAT A STATE HE BEGINS QUARRELLING WITH THE DOOR MAT THAT HIS POOR WIFE MAY BE AFRAID TO SPEAK TO HIM A MEAN WRETCH BUT DON'T YOU THINK I'LL BE LIKE MISSUS PRETTYMAN NO I WOULDN'T PUT UP WITH IT FROM THE BEST MAN THAT EVER TROD
THE WINDOW MUST GO AS IT IS AND PRETTY WEATHER FOR A DEAR CHILD TO SLEEP WITH A BROKEN WINDOW HE'S GOT A COLD ALREADY ON HIS LUNGS AND I SHOULDN'T AT ALL WONDER IF THAT BROKEN WINDOW SETTLED HIM
WHETHER JOB FOLLOWED HIS OWN BRAIN OR THE WISE DIRECTION OF ANOTHER WE KNOW NOT BUT HE RESOLVED EVERY NIGHT TO COMMIT TO PAPER ONE CURTAIN LECTURE OF HIS LATE WIFE
AND NOW I SUPPOSE IT WILL BE THE TAVERN EVERY NIGHT IF YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SIT UP FOR YOU MISTER CAUDLE YOU'RE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN NO AND I'M NOT GOING TO GET OUT OF MY WARM BED TO LET YOU IN EITHER
TRUE IT WAS SHE WAS DEAD AND DECENTLY INTERRED HIS MIND IT WAS A COMFORT TO KNOW IT COULD NOT WANDER ON THIS POINT THIS HE KNEW NEVERTHELESS HIS WIFE WAS WITH HIM
AND WAS THEREFORE MADE THE RECIPIENT OF A WIFE'S WISDOM MISSUS CAUDLE LIKE MAHOMET'S DOVE CONTINUALLY PECKED AT THE GOOD MAN'S EARS AND IT IS A HAPPINESS TO LEARN FROM WHAT HE LEFT BEHIND
AS WAS THE TIN FUNNEL THROUGH WHICH MISSUS CAUDLE IN VINTAGE TIME BOTTLED HER ELDER WINE THERE WAS HOWEVER THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WISDOM AND THE WINE THE WINE WAS ALWAYS SUGARED
HE WAS IN THE RIPE FULNESS OF FIFTY SEVEN FOR THREE HOURS AT LEAST AFTER HE WENT TO BED SUCH SLAVES ARE WE TO HABIT HE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE HIS WIFE STILL TALKED AT HIS SIDE
IT'S ENOUGH FOR A WIFE TO SIT LIKE CINDERELLA BY THE ASHES WHILST HER HUSBAND CAN GO DRINKING AND SINGING AT A TAVERN YOU NEVER SING HOW DO I KNOW YOU NEVER SING
BUY MYSELF A PIN CUSHION THOUGH I'VE WANTED ONE THESE SIX MONTHS
THEY NEVER THINK OF THEIR POOR WIVES WHO ARE GRIEVING AND WEARING THEMSELVES OUT AT HOME A NICE HEADACHE YOU'LL HAVE TO MORROW MORNING OR RATHER THIS MORNING FOR IT MUST BE PAST TWELVE YOU WON'T HAVE A HEADACHE
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND TO LOSE HER NOW THE CHILD MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAVED BUT PEOPLE CAN'T SAVE THEIR CHILDREN AND THROW AWAY THEIR FIVE POUNDS TOO I WONDER WHERE POOR LITTLE MOPSY IS
BY THE FACT THAT IN MOST PLACES HE HAD AFFIXED THE TEXT
AND THEN REPORTED TO HIS MASTER THAT THE OLD BOYS WERE ALL RIGHT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY THE LIGHTS OF ANOTHER STEAMER WERE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE AND APPARENTLY COMING UP VERY FAST THIS WAS A SIGNAL FOR A GENERAL COMMOTION ON THE PATRIOT
AND MORE DIFFICULT TO GNAW WHILE OTHERS COMPLAINED THAT THE BARK OF THEIR TREES TASTED VERY BITTER AND OF COURSE THAT MADE THEIR TASK UNPLEASANT THOSE SIX TREES FALLING ONE AFTER ANOTHER MADE SUCH A RACKET
THE SIGN DOESN'T MEAN THAT HUNTING AND FISHING ARE TO BE STOPPED IT MEANS THAT NO ONE BUT JOHNNIE GREEN IS GOING TO HUNT AND FISH IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE BOAT AT BATON ROUGE AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF PASSENGERS WERE TAKEN ON BOARD AND AMONGST THEM SEVERAL PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN ATTENDING THE RACES GAMBLING AND DRINKING WERE NOW THE ORDER OF THE DAY
YOU IS NOW TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AN NO MORE DUS YOU HEAR DAT YES RESPONDED TOBY
WHERE HE COULD GET AIR WITHOUT BEING SEEN BUT NO ONE COULD PROVE IT SO HE WON THE RACE JUST THE SAME NEXT CAME THE TREE FELLING CONTEST THERE WERE SIX INCLUDING BROWNIE BEAVER THAT TOOK PART IN IT
AND AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED ONE OF THE BOILERS IMMEDIATELY EXPLODED ONE DENSE FOG OF STEAM FILLED EVERY PART OF THE VESSEL WHILE SHRIEKS GROANS AND CRIES WERE HEARD ON EVERY HAND THE SALOONS AND CABINS SOON HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A HOSPITAL
THAT HE APPEARED PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT TO THE HEARTRENDING SCENES WHICH DAILY OCCURRED IN HIS PRESENCE IT WAS ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE STEAMER'S VOYAGE THAT POMPEY SELECTED FIVE OF THE OLD SLAVES TOOK THEM IN A ROOM BY THEMSELVES AND COMMENCED PREPARING THEM FOR THE MARKET
ALL WENT ON WELL THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY AT TEN O'CLOCK THE BOAT ARRIVED AT NEW ORLEANS
AND IF HE DID NOT TAKE DELIGHT IN DISCHARGING HIS DUTY HE DID IT WITH A DEGREE OF ALACRITY SO THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE THE APPROBATION OF HIS MASTER POMP AS WALKER USUALLY CALLED HIM WAS OF REAL NEGRO BLOOD AND WOULD OFTEN SAY WHEN ALLUDING TO HIMSELF
BROWNIE BEAVER HIMSELF PASSED HIS HAT AROUND TO TAKE UP THE VOTES AND IT WAS QUICKLY FOUND THAT EVERY VOTE WAS FOR BROWNIE BEAVER HE HAD EVEN VOTED FOR HIMSELF BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO CARE ABOUT THAT
DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF A POND AND SLIP INSIDE A DOOR WHICH LED TO A WINDING HALL
AND EACH EXERTING ITSELF TO KEEP THE ASCENDANCY IN POINT OF SPEED THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR THE MOON SHINING BRIGHTLY AND THE BOATS SO NEAR TO EACH OTHER THAT THE PASSENGERS WERE CALLING OUT FROM ONE BOAT TO THE OTHER
WHICH CAUSED GREAT UNEASINESS TO THE LADIES AND TOOK THE GENTLEMEN TO THAT PART OF THE CABIN HOWEVER NOTHING SERIOUS HAD OCCURRED A MAN AT ONE OF THE TABLES WHERE THEY WERE GAMBLING HAD BEEN SEEN ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL A CARD IN HIS SLEEVE
OLD DOG SPOT CHASED HIM MISTER CROW REPLIED BUT YOU MUSTN'T ASK QUESTIONS HE COMPLAINED YOU CAN'T ASK QUESTIONS OF A NEWSPAPER YOU KNOW WELL WHAT HAPPENED ON SATURDAY
WELL SAID POMPEY ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY I IS DE GENTMAN DAT IS TO GET YOU READY SO DAT YOU WILL BRING MARSER A GOOD PRICE IN DE ORLEANS MARKET HOW OLD IS YOU
HE LIGHTED RIGHT ON TOP OF BROWNIE BEAVER'S HOUSE AND CALLED PAPER DOWN THE CHIMNEY JUST LIKE THAT BROWNIE HAPPENED TO BE INSIDE HIS HOUSE AND IN A WONDERFULLY SHORT TIME HIS HEAD APPEARED
IN ORDER TO HAVE PLENTY TO EAT WHEN COLD WEATHER CAME AND THE ICE CLOSED THEIR POND SOME OF THEIR FOOD THEY CARRIED INTO THEIR HOUSES THROUGH A STRAIGHT HALL WHICH WAS MADE FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE
THAT OLD MISTER CROW HEARD THE NOISE MILES AWAY AND FLEW OVER TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AFTER EVERYBODY CREPT OUT OF HIS HIDING PLACE SOME TIME AFTERWARD EVERYONE HAD TO HIDE FOR A WHILE YOU KNOW
AND HE WENT RIGHT ON TALKING ON THURSDAY MISTER WOODCHUCK WENT TO VISIT HIS COUSINS IN THE WEST MISSUS WOODCHUCK IS WORRIED WHAT'S SHE WORRIED ABOUT BROWNIE INQUIRED SHE'S AFRAID HE'S COMING BACK AGAIN
THERE WAS GREAT REJOICING IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE IN THE POND WHEN BROWNIE BEAVER RETURNED WITH THE GOOD NEWS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE HUNTING AND FISHING AND WHEN OLD GRANDADDY BEAVER SAID THAT EVERYBODY OUGHT TO TAKE A HOLIDAY TO CELEBRATE THE OCCASION
AND HE LEFT FASTER THAN HE CAME BROWNIE BEAVER WANTED TO KNOW WHERE TOMMY FOX MADE HIS VISIT AT FARMER GREEN'S HEN HOUSE MISTER CROW EXPLAINED WHY DID HE HURRY AWAY BROWNIE ASKED
AND HE BUILT IT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAID HE WOULD RATHER HAVE A NEAT NEW HOUSE THAN ONE OF THE BIG OLD DWELLINGS THAT HAD BEEN BUILT MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD HELPED THROW THE DAM ACROSS THE STREAM THE DAM WAS THERE STILL
SO I SHALL NOT TELL YOU THE REST UNTIL NEXT SATURDAY YOU SEE YOU HAVE A FEW THINGS TO LEARN ABOUT TAKING A NEWSPAPER
I WAS TWENTY NINE LAST POTATO DIGGING TIME SAID THE MAN WHAT'S YOUR NAME MY NAME IS TOBIAS BUT DEY CALL ME TOBY WELL TOBY OR MISTER TOBIAS IF DAT WILL SUIT YOU BETTER
AND INSTRUCTED HIM AS TO GETTING THE NEGROES READY FOR MARKET AMONGST THE FORTY NEGROES WERE SEVERAL WHOSE APPEARANCE INDICATED THAT THEY HAD SEEN SOME YEARS AND HAD GONE THROUGH SOME SERVICES
FEW PERSONS CAN ARRIVE AT ANYTHING LIKE THE AGE OF A NEGRO BY MERE OBSERVATION UNLESS THEY ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RACE THEREFORE THE SLAVE TRADER VERY FREQUENTLY CARRIED OUT THIS DECEPTION WITH PERFECT IMPUNITY AFTER THE STEAMER HAD LEFT THE WHARF
FROM THE ONE WHERE FARMER GREEN WENT EACH WEEK OVER BEYOND BLUE MOUNTAIN ALL THE HOUSES WERE BUILT IN A POND AND ALL THEIR DOORS WERE UNDER WATER BUT NOBODY MINDED THAT BECAUSE LIKE BROWNIE BEAVER
BUT WHEN YOU GET IN DE MARKET AN ANYBODY AXE YOU HOW OLD YOU IS AN YOU TELL EM FORTY FIVE MARSER WILL TIE YOU UP AN GIB YOU DE WHIP LIKE SMOKE
THE MANTLED TREACHERY OF HIS SOUL O WHERE IS HE WHO HATH SURVEYED THE HORRORS OF OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE THERE IS AN EYE THAT WAKES IN LIGHT THERE IS A HAND OF PEERLESS MIGHT WHICH SOON OR LATE
THEIR GREY HAIR AND WHISKERS AT ONCE PRONOUNCED THEM TO BE ABOVE THE AGES SET DOWN IN THE TRADER'S ADVERTISEMENT
I ONLY WANT ONE FOR MY OWN USE AND WOULD NOT NEED ANOTHER SAID THE MAN IN BLACK AS HE AND THE TRADER LEFT THE ROOM WALKER AND THE PARSON WENT INTO THE SALOON TALKED OVER THE MATTER THE BILL OF SALE WAS MADE OUT THE MONEY PAID OVER
BROWNIE WAS IN A GREAT HURRY FOR SATURDAY TO ARRIVE IN ORDER TO MAKE NO MISTAKE HE PUT ASIDE A STICK IN WHICH HE GNAWED A NOTCH EACH DAY AND IN THAT WAY HE KNEW EXACTLY WHEN SATURDAY CAME
AT THIS MOMENT THE ENGINEER OF THE PATRIOT WAS SEEN TO FASTEN DOWN THE SAFETY VALVE SO THAT NO STEAM SHOULD ESCAPE THIS WAS INDEED A DANGEROUS RESORT
ON BOARD THE PATRIOT THE FIREMEN WERE USING OIL LARD BUTTER AND EVEN BACON WITH THE WOOD FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING THE STEAM TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH THE BLAZE MINGLED WITH THE BLACK SMOKE SHOWED PLAINLY THAT THE OTHER BOAT WAS BURNING MORE THAN WOOD
HE GOES TO BED AT NIGHT THE PROPERTY OF THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAS LIVED FOR YEARS AND GETS UP IN THE MORNING THE SLAVE OF SOME ONE WHOM HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
SHALL YET ASSAIL AND REND DISSIMULATION'S VEIL
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS CHANGE HANDS DURING A PASSAGE FROM LOUISVILLE OR SAINT LOUIS TO NEW ORLEANS ON A MISSISSIPPI STEAMER AND MANY MEN AND EVEN LADIES ARE COMPLETELY RUINED GO CALL MY BOY STEWARD
I CLAIM THE RIGHT OF REDEEMING THAT BOY MISTER JOHNSON MY FATHER GAVE HIM TO ME WHEN I CAME OF AGE AND I PROMISED NOT TO PART WITH HIM MOST CERTAINLY SIR THE BOY SHALL BE YOURS WHENEVER YOU HAND ME OVER A COOL THOUSAND REPLIED JOHNSON
ANOTHER QUESTION I DECLARE I DON'T BELIEVE YOU EVER TOOK A NEWSPAPER BEFORE DID YOU BROWNIE BEAVER ADMITTED THAT HE NEVER HAD THEN SAID MISTER CROW THEN DON'T INTERRUPT ME AGAIN PLEASE
ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO A MAN WHO FROM APPEARANCE WAS NOT LESS THAN FORTY IF I LIVE TO SEE NEXT CORN PLANTING TIME I WILL EITHER BE FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW WHICH
YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT SIGN IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS NOT FARMER GREEN BUT HIS SON JOHNNIE WHO NAILED IT TO THE TREE
OUR EYES ARE YET ON AFRIC'S SHORES HER THOUSAND WRONGS WE STILL DEPLORE WE SEE THE GRIM SLAVE TRADER THERE WE HEAR HIS FETTERED VICTIM'S PRAYER AND HASTEN TO THE SUFFERER'S AID
OF COURSE YOUR ENEMY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SWIM AS WELL AS YOU BUT MAYBE HE WOULD THINK TWICE OR EVEN THREE TIMES BEFORE HE WENT PROWLING THROUGH YOUR CROOKED HALL FOR IF YOU HAD ENORMOUS STRONG SHARP TEETH
AND SOME OF THE BRANCHES THEY FASTENED UNDER WATER NEAR THE DAM IT WAS JUST LIKE PUTTING GREEN THINGS INTO A REFRIGERATOR SO THEY WILL KEEP NOW YOU SEE WHY BROWNIE BEAVER WOULD NO MORE HAVE THOUGHT OF BUILDING HIS HOUSE ON DRY LAND
AND BROWNIE BEAVER SAID THAT AFTER THE HOLIDAY WAS OVER HE WOULD SUGGEST THAT SOMEONE BE CHOSEN TO GO DOWN AND THANK FARMER GREEN FOR PUTTING THE NOTICE ON THE TREE THE WHOLE VILLAGE AGREED TO BROWNIE'S PROPOSAL
AND INSTEAD OF HUNTING AND FISHING BEING STOPPED
SHOULD BE FAR BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT THAT MADE A HOUSE SAFER TOO TO YOU SUCH AN IDEA MAY SEEM VERY STRANGE BUT IF YOU WERE CHASED BY AN ENEMY YOU MIGHT BE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SWIM UNDER WATER
AND THEN WITH HIS FORTY SLAVES STARTED FOR THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET AS MANY OF THE SLAVES HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN RICHMOND AND HAD RELATIONS RESIDING THERE THE SLAVE TRADER DETERMINED TO LEAVE THE CITY EARLY IN THE MORNING
WELL DEN I GUESS I WILL ONLY BE THIRTY WHEN DEY AXE ME REPLIED THE CHATTEL
THOSE THAT LIVED THERE THOUGHT THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO STAY THERE AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED IT WAS IN THIS VILLAGE THAT BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS NEIGHBORS LIVED IT WAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF TOWN TOO
WITH WHICH YOU COULD GNAW RIGHT THROUGH A TREE HE WOULD NOT CARE TO HAVE YOU SEIZE HIM AS HE POKED HIS HEAD AROUND A CORNER IN A DARK PASSAGE OF A STRANGE HOUSE IT WAS IN A HOUSE OF THAT KIND THAT BROWNIE BEAVER LIVED
FOR A FEW MOMENTS BROWNIE WAITED TO HEAR THE REST BUT A FEW MOMENTS WAS MORE THAN HE COULD ENDURE WHY DIDN'T JIMMY CUT OFF HIS TAIL BROWNIE ASKED EAGERLY THERE SAID MISTER CROW YOU'VE DONE JUST AS I TOLD YOU NOT TO
THOUGH YOU PERHAPS MIGHT NOT CARE FOR THEM AT ALL THEY WANTED THEIR HOUSES TO BE SURROUNDED BY WATER BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFER WHEN BUILT IN THAT MANNER AND THEY ALWAYS INSISTED THAT A DOOR LEADING INTO A HOUSE
AND BY DAMMING IT THOSE OLD SETTLERS MADE A POND IN WHICH THEY COULD BUILD THEIR HOUSES THEY HAD IDEAS OF THEIR OWN AS TO WHAT A HOUSE SHOULD BE LIKE
BUT NOBODY CARED TO GO AND THE WHOLE VILLAGE SEEMED GREATLY DISAPPOINTED UNTIL GRANDADDY BEAVER MADE A SHORT SPEECH
HE WAS AFRAID THAT IF HE SAID ANOTHER WORD MISTER CROW WOULD GROW ANGRY AND FLY AWAY WITHOUT TELLING HIM ANY MORE NEWS
ABOVE THE WATER AND HE SOON CRAWLED UP BESIDE MISTER CROW WELL I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU HE TOLD MISTER CROW PETER MINK CAUGHT A MONSTROUS EEL IN THE DUCK POND ON MONDAY MISTER CROW SAID
TO BEHOLD FIVE OR SIX TABLES IN A STEAMBOAT'S CABIN WITH HALF A DOZEN MEN PLAYING AT CARDS AND MONEY PISTOLS BOWIE KNIVES ALL IN CONFUSION ON THE TABLES IS WHAT MAY BE SEEN AT ALMOST ANY TIME ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ON THE FOURTH DAY WHILE AT NATCHEZ
WALKER HAD ALREADY ADVERTISED IN THE NEW ORLEANS PAPERS THAT HE WOULD BE THERE AT A STATED TIME WITH A PRIME LOT OF ABLE BODIED SLAVES READY FOR FIELD SERVICE TOGETHER WITH A FEW EXTRA ONES BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE
I WILL SEE YOU AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BETTER SAID SMITH AS HIS SERVANT JERRY APPROACHED THE TABLE
IT WAS SO OLD THAT TREES WERE GROWING ON IT AND THERE WAS AN ODD THING ABOUT IT IT WAS NEVER FINISHED THOUGH BROWNIE BEAVER WAS A YOUNG CHAP HE WORKED ON THE DAM SOMETIMES LIKE ALL HIS NEIGHBORS
WHEN IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW MOTHER ON THE OCCASION FOR A FEW DAYS EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY INCLUDED SOME MENTION OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISSUS WESTON HAD RECEIVED
AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN A HOUSE OF HER OWN BUT WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSE OF HER OWN THIS IS THREE TIMES AS LARGE AND YOU HAVE NEVER ANY ODD HUMOURS MY DEAR
THE REAL EVILS INDEED OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO WELL OF HERSELF
MISSUS WESTON OUGHT TO HAVE FOUND MORE IN IT FOR SHE HAD A HUSBAND WHOSE WARM HEART AND SWEET TEMPER MADE HIM THINK EVERY THING DUE TO HER IN RETURN FOR THE GREAT GOODNESS OF BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM BUT THOUGH SHE HAD ONE SORT OF SPIRIT
HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS AND HOPED BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY THROUGH THE EVENING
TAYLOR WHEN THEY LEFT HER AT RANDALLS IN THE CENTRE OF EVERY DOMESTIC COMFORT OR SAW HER GO AWAY IN THE EVENING ATTENDED BY HER PLEASANT HUSBAND TO A CARRIAGE OF HER OWN
SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS
ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE WITH AN ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE OF A SPIRIT
SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY
ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER
THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY SHE RECALLED HER PAST KINDNESS THE KINDNESS THE AFFECTION OF SIXTEEN YEARS HOW SHE HAD TAUGHT AND HOW SHE HAD PLAYED WITH HER FROM FIVE YEARS OLD
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL HAS WRITTEN TO MISSUS WESTON
MISS CHURCHILL HOWEVER BEING OF AGE AND WITH THE FULL COMMAND OF HER FORTUNE THOUGH HER FORTUNE BORE NO PROPORTION TO THE FAMILY ESTATE
SHE DID NOT CEASE TO LOVE HER HUSBAND BUT SHE WANTED AT ONCE TO BE THE WIFE OF CAPTAIN WESTON AND MISS CHURCHILL OF ENSCOMBE CAPTAIN WESTON WHO HAD BEEN CONSIDERED
AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO
AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER THOUGH COMPARATIVELY BUT LITTLE REMOVED BY MATRIMONY
HER SITUATION WAS ALTOGETHER THE SUBJECT OF HOURS OF GRATITUDE TO MISSUS WESTON AND OF MOMENTS ONLY OF REGRET AND HER SATISFACTION HER MORE THAN SATISFACTION HER CHEERFUL ENJOYMENT WAS SO JUST
WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY BUT PARTICULARLY CONNECTED WITH IT AS THE ELDER BROTHER OF ISABELLA'S HUSBAND HE LIVED ABOUT A MILE FROM HIGHBURY
ON COMING OF AGE IT WAS MOST UNLIKELY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD EVER WANT HIS FATHER'S ASSISTANCE HIS FATHER HAD NO APPREHENSION OF IT THE AUNT WAS A CAPRICIOUS WOMAN AND GOVERNED HER HUSBAND ENTIRELY
IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND
YOUR MAKING THE MATCH AS YOU CALL IT MEANS ONLY YOUR PLANNING IT YOUR SAYING TO YOURSELF ONE IDLE DAY I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FOR MISS TAYLOR IF MISTER WESTON WERE TO MARRY HER
WHERE MOST OF HIS LEISURE DAYS WERE SPENT AND BETWEEN USEFUL OCCUPATION AND THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY THE NEXT EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY HE HAD BY THAT TIME REALISED AN EASY COMPETENCE
I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD DIRTY SIR LOOK AT MY SHOES NOT A SPECK ON THEM
BUT DEAR EMMA WAS OF NO FEEBLE CHARACTER
MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF
BUT NEVER DID SHE GO WITHOUT MISTER WOODHOUSE'S GIVING A GENTLE SIGH AND SAYING AH POOR MISS TAYLOR SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO STAY
AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE ONE THAT I MADE THE MATCH MYSELF I MADE THE MATCH YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO AND TO HAVE IT TAKE PLACE AND BE PROVED IN THE RIGHT
AND HE HAD ONLY HIS OWN COMFORT TO SEEK AND HIS OWN SITUATION TO IMPROVE AS HE COULD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE BECAME DESIRABLE HE QUITTED THE MILITIA AND ENGAGED IN TRADE
AND SO APPARENT THAT EMMA WELL AS SHE KNEW HER FATHER WAS SOMETIMES TAKEN BY SURPRIZE
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE
THROUGH AT HARTFIELD BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND
RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES AND MISTER WOODHOUSE HAD NOT MARRIED EARLY WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS
AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING
WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA OH NO I MEANT ONLY MYSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME YOU KNOW IN A JOKE IT IS ALL A JOKE
IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE
TO BE ALLOWED TO BRING MISS SMITH WITH HER A MOST WELCOME REQUEST FOR MISS SMITH WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHOM EMMA KNEW VERY WELL BY SIGHT AND HAD LONG FELT AN INTEREST IN ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEAUTY
SHE LOVED EVERY BODY WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER
WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID
SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF
ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY
IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL
AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU
HAVING BROTHERS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN A GOOD WAY IN LONDON WHICH AFFORDED HIM A FAVOURABLE OPENING IT WAS A CONCERN WHICH BROUGHT JUST EMPLOYMENT ENOUGH HE HAD STILL A SMALL HOUSE IN HIGHBURY
IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE HER FATHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER
POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY
WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT
AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DONE HARM TO YOURSELF THAN GOOD TO THEM BY INTERFERENCE
THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER
BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS TILL HER FATHER AWOKE
AND IT TOOK PLACE TO THE INFINITE MORTIFICATION OF MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL
AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
MISTER WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD AND HIS GOOD NATURE FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER
A VERY GRACIOUS INVITATION WAS RETURNED AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL
AND MISS CHURCHILL FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM NOBODY WAS SURPRIZED EXCEPT HER BROTHER AND HIS WIFE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN HIM AND WHO WERE FULL OF PRIDE AND IMPORTANCE WHICH THE CONNEXION WOULD OFFEND
BEING SETTLED IN LONDON ONLY SIXTEEN MILES OFF WAS MUCH BEYOND HER DAILY REACH
BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER
YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN AND HOW IMPORTANT TO HER TO BE SECURE OF A COMFORTABLE PROVISION
AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM
HAVE WHAT YOU WILL AND HE MADE A SIGN TO FRANZ TO TAKE WHAT HE PLEASED IS IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THEN TO SEND THE MONEY TO LUIGI VAMPA ASKED THE YOUNG MAN LOOKING FIXEDLY IN HIS TURN AT THE COUNT

HAVE A EUROPEAN CELEBRITY FRANZ AND ALBERT HAD BROUGHT TO ROME LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION TO THEM AND THEIR FIRST QUESTION ON HIS ARRIVAL WAS TO INQUIRE THE WHEREABOUTS OF HIS TRAVELLING COMPANION FRANZ REPLIED THAT HE HAD LEFT HIM AT THE MOMENT
IT BE TO GO TO A BALL OUR FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF COUNTESS WHOM I LEFT IN PURSUIT OF HIS UNKNOWN ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK THIS EVENING SAID FRANZ AND WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE AND DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS NOT AT ALL
THE STREET WAS SAFER FOR HIM ALBERT THEN HAD FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE FAMOUS BANDIT CHIEF IN WHOSE EXISTENCE HE HAD FOR SO LONG A TIME REFUSED TO BELIEVE THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE HE HASTENED TO OPEN THE SECRETARY
AND THEREFORE WE HAD BETTER GO WITH ALL SPEED TO EXTRICATE HIM FROM THE HANDS OF THE INFIDELS ARE YOU STILL RESOLVED TO ACCOMPANY ME MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER WELL THEN COME ALONG FRANZ AND THE COUNT WENT DOWNSTAIRS ACCOMPANIED BY PEPPINO
AND FRANZ AND THE COUNT WERE IN UTTER DARKNESS EXCEPT THAT FIFTY PACES IN ADVANCE OF THEM A REDDISH GLARE MORE EVIDENT SINCE PEPPINO HAD PUT OUT HIS TORCH WAS VISIBLE ALONG THE WALL THEY ADVANCED SILENTLY THE COUNT GUIDING FRANZ
SAID THE CAPTAIN THAT IS THE LEAST HONOR THAT I CAN RENDER TO YOUR EXCELLENCY AND TAKING THE LIGHTED TORCH FROM THE HANDS OF THE HERDSMAN HE PRECEDED HIS GUESTS NOT AS A SERVANT WHO PERFORMS AN ACT OF CIVILITY BUT LIKE A KING WHO PRECEDES AMBASSADORS ON REACHING THE DOOR
AND ALBERT FOLLOWED BY FRANZ AND THE COUNT DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE CROSSED THE SQUARE CHAMBER WHERE STOOD ALL THE BANDITS HAT IN HAND PEPPINO SAID THE BRIGAND CHIEF GIVE ME THE TORCH WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO INQUIRED THE COUNT I WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY BACK MYSELF
REPLIED FRANZ I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT WORK YOU WERE PERUSING WITH SO MUCH ATTENTION AS WE ENTERED CAESAR'S COMMENTARIES SAID THE BANDIT
TO GO BEFORE FRANZ WITH A LIGHT THE YOUNG MAN HAD FOUND SIGNOR PASTRINI LOOKING VERY MUCH ALARMED AND THIS HAD ONLY MADE HIM THE MORE ANXIOUS TO READ ALBERT'S LETTER AND SO HE WENT INSTANTLY TOWARDS THE WAXLIGHT AND UNFOLDED IT IT WAS WRITTEN
TO THEM BOTH TO MAKE UP THE SUM THAT ALBERT REQUIRED TRUE HE MIGHT IN SUCH A CASE RELY ON THE KINDNESS OF SIGNOR TORLONIA HE WAS THEREFORE ABOUT TO RETURN TO THE PALAZZO BRACCIANO WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME WHEN SUDDENLY A LUMINOUS IDEA CROSSED HIS MIND
DINNER WAS WAITING BUT AS ALBERT HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULD NOT RETURN SO SOON FRANZ SAT DOWN WITHOUT HIM SIGNOR PASTRINI
YOU ARE DECIDEDLY RIGHT AND WE MAY REACH THE PALAZZO BY TWO O'CLOCK SIGNOR LUIGI CONTINUED ALBERT
YES YOUR EXCELLENCY HE HAS THIS MOMENT RETURNED IS HE IN BED I SHOULD SAY NO THEN RING AT HIS DOOR
AND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONTRIVE A BETTER HAVE YOU A CARRIAGE NO THAT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE I ALWAYS HAVE ONE READY DAY AND NIGHT ALWAYS READY YES
AT WHICH I HAD FIXED YOUR FRIEND'S RANSOM THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED BUT SAID FRANZ LOOKING ROUND HIM UNEASILY
HE REMEMBERED THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO FRANZ WAS ABOUT TO RING FOR SIGNOR PASTRINI
THE COACHMAN WENT UP THE VIA DI RIPETTA AND THE PORTA SAN PAOLA AND WHEN THEY WERE TWO HUNDRED YARDS OUTSIDE AS THE FRENCHMAN BECAME SOMEWHAT TOO FORWARD BEPPO PUT A BRACE OF PISTOLS TO HIS HEAD THE COACHMAN PULLED UP
BE PRUDENT IN ANY EVENT SAID THE COUNTESS OH PRAY BE ASSURED OF THAT FRANZ TOOK HIS HAT AND WENT AWAY IN HASTE HE HAD SENT AWAY HIS CARRIAGE WITH ORDERS FOR IT TO FETCH HIM AT TWO O'CLOCK FORTUNATELY
AND YET I REPEAT TO YOU YOU HAVE CARRIED HIM OFF AND CONVEYED HIM HITHER AND ADDED THE COUNT TAKING THE LETTER FROM HIS POCKET YOU HAVE SET A RANSOM ON HIM AS IF HE WERE AN UTTER STRANGER WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME ALL THIS
RISE AND ANSWER PEPPINO GLANCED ANXIOUSLY AT FRANZ
AT TORLONIA'S WITH THE COUNTESS G THEN HE DREW HIS WATCH FROM HIS POCKET THAT HE MIGHT SEE HOW TIME SPED HALF PAST ONE ONLY SAID HE WHY THE DEVIL DO YOU ROUSE ME AT THIS HOUR TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE FREE YOUR EXCELLENCY MY DEAR FELLOW
WELL CONTINUED THE COUNT IN A TONE THAT MADE FRANZ SHUDDER THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN IS ONE OF MY FRIENDS THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN LODGES IN THE SAME HOTEL AS MYSELF THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN HAS BEEN UP AND DOWN THE CORSO FOR EIGHT HOURS IN MY PRIVATE CARRIAGE

HE BOWED AND NOW YOUR EXCELLENCY ADDED HE ALLOW ME TO REPEAT MY APOLOGIES AND I HOPE YOU WILL NOT ENTERTAIN ANY RESENTMENT AT WHAT HAS OCCURRED NO MY DEAR VAMPA REPLIED THE COUNT BESIDES YOU COMPENSATE FOR YOUR MISTAKES IN SO
WHO WERE CONCEALED ON THE BANKS OF THE ALMO SURROUNDED THE CARRIAGE THE FRENCHMAN MADE SOME RESISTANCE AND NEARLY STRANGLED BEPPO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST FIVE ARMED MEN AND WAS FORCED TO YIELD THEY MADE HIM GET OUT WALK ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER
GOING ALONG A NARROW PATH THAT LED OVER THE IRREGULAR AND BROKEN SURFACE OF THE CAMPAGNA AND FINALLY HE DISAPPEARED IN THE MIDST OF THE TALL RED HERBAGE WHICH SEEMED LIKE THE BRISTLING MANE OF AN ENORMOUS LION NOW SAID THE COUNT
WHO WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN BEFORE A GROTTO WHICH WAS ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE BECAUSE IN THAT SPOT THE DARKNESS SEEMED MORE DENSE THAN ELSEWHERE WHEN THE COUNT THOUGHT FRANZ HAD GAZED SUFFICIENTLY ON THIS PICTURESQUE TABLEAU HE RAISED HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS
WHO WERE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE CATACOMBS OF SAINT SEBASTIAN
HE ORDERED THE CARRIAGE THEREFORE FOR ELEVEN O'CLOCK DESIRING SIGNOR PASTRINI TO INFORM HIM THE MOMENT THAT ALBERT RETURNED TO THE HOTEL AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ALBERT HAD NOT COME BACK FRANZ DRESSED HIMSELF AND WENT OUT TELLING HIS HOST
BY HEAVENS IF I THOUGHT ONE OF YOU KNEW THAT THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS THE FRIEND OF HIS EXCELLENCY I WOULD BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT WITH MY OWN HAND WELL SAID THE COUNT TURNING TOWARDS FRANZ I TOLD YOU THERE WAS SOME MISTAKE IN THIS ARE YOU NOT ALONE
NO MATTER I KNOW IT THE COUNT KNIT HIS BROWS AND REMAINED SILENT AN INSTANT AND IF I WENT TO SEEK VAMPA WOULD YOU ACCOMPANY ME IF MY SOCIETY WOULD NOT BE DISAGREEABLE BE IT SO
NON SONO NELLE MIE MANI ALLA SETTE
FIVE CORRIDORS DIVERGED LIKE THE RAYS OF A STAR AND THE WALLS DUG INTO NICHES WHICH WERE ARRANGED ONE ABOVE THE OTHER IN THE SHAPE OF COFFINS SHOWED THAT THEY WERE AT LAST IN THE CATACOMBS DOWN ONE OF THE CORRIDORS WHOSE EXTENT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE
YOU ARE RIGHT YOUR EXCELLENCY HE SAID THIS MUST BE ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS
AND I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER ME AS UNDER ETERNAL OBLIGATIONS TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR THE CARRIAGE
NO EXCELLENCY AND NEVER SHALL I FORGET IT RETURNED PEPPINO WITH AN ACCENT OF PROFOUND GRATITUDE NEVER THAT IS A LONG TIME
AND WHISTLED IN A PECULIAR MANNER THE MAN IN THE MANTLE QUITTED THE WALL
IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME THE OPENING OF THE CATACOMBS IS CLOSE AT HAND GO ON THEN REPLIED THE COUNT THEY CAME TO AN OPENING BEHIND A CLUMP OF BUSHES AND IN THE MIDST OF A PILE OF ROCKS BY WHICH A MAN COULD SCARCELY PASS
ALBERT LOOKED AROUND AND PERCEIVED FRANZ WHAT SAID HE IS IT YOU MY DEAR FRANZ WHOSE DEVOTION AND FRIENDSHIP ARE THUS DISPLAYED NO NOT I REPLIED FRANZ BUT OUR NEIGHBOR THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO OH MY DEAR COUNT
WHICH ONE OF THE BANDITS HAD LENT HIM LYING IN A CORNER IN PROFOUND SLUMBER COME SAID THE COUNT SMILING WITH HIS OWN PECULIAR SMILE NOT SO BAD FOR A MAN WHO IS TO BE SHOT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK TO MORROW MORNING VAMPA LOOKED AT ALBERT WITH A KIND OF ADMIRATION
AS IN THIS MOMENT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ROME UNDER THE MAGIC BREATH OF SOME DEMON OF THE NIGHT HAD SUDDENLY CHANGED INTO A VAST TOMB BY A CHANCE WHICH ADDED YET MORE TO THE INTENSITY OF THE DARKNESS THE MOON WHICH WAS ON THE WANE
IS ONE OF MY FRIENDS YOU ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU THIS TITLE CONTINUED THE COUNT IN FRENCH IT IS NECESSARY TO EXCITE THIS MAN'S CONFIDENCE YOU CAN SPEAK BEFORE ME SAID FRANZ I AM A FRIEND OF THE COUNT'S GOOD RETURNED PEPPINO I

IN WHICH HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN AN ORDER TO HIS SERVANT THE MESSENGER OBEYED WITHOUT THE LEAST HESITATION BUT RATHER WITH ALACRITY AND MOUNTING THE STEPS AT A BOUND ENTERED THE HOTEL FIVE SECONDS AFTERWARDS HE WAS AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM AH IT IS YOU PEPPINO
HERE WAS ONE WHOSE GAY TEMPERAMENT WAS NOT FOR A MOMENT ALTERED AS FOR FRANZ HE WAS ENCHANTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH ALBERT HAD SUSTAINED THE NATIONAL HONOR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BANDIT MY DEAR ALBERT HE SAID IF YOU WILL MAKE HASTE
LET US FOLLOW HIM FRANZ AND THE COUNT IN THEIR TURN THEN ADVANCED ALONG THE SAME PATH WHICH AT THE DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED PACES LED THEM OVER A DECLIVITY TO THE BOTTOM OF A SMALL VALLEY THEY THEN PERCEIVED TWO MEN CONVERSING IN THE OBSCURITY
DID NOT RISE UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK
THEN IT IS TO YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT THIS LETTER IS ADDRESSED IS THERE ANY ANSWER INQUIRED FRANZ TAKING THE LETTER FROM HIM YES YOUR FRIEND AT LEAST HOPES SO COME UP STAIRS WITH ME AND I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO GO SAID THE DUKE TO FRANZ YOU WHO KNOW ROME BETTER THAN HE DOES
AND THOSE WHO ARE HERE WILL COMPLAIN OF BUT ONE THING ITS TOO RAPID FLIGHT I AM NOT SPEAKING SAID THE DUKE WITH A SMILE OF THE PERSONS WHO ARE HERE
HAVE YOU THE MONEY HE DEMANDS YES ALL BUT EIGHT HUNDRED PIASTRES THE COUNT WENT TO HIS SECRETARY OPENED IT AND PULLING OUT A DRAWER FILLED WITH GOLD SAID TO FRANZ
HAS SENT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT A MAN IS WAITING FOR YOU WITH A LETTER
THE ROAD WHICH THE CARRIAGE NOW TRAVERSED WAS THE ANCIENT APPIAN WAY AND BORDERED WITH TOMBS FROM TIME TO TIME
THAN THAT OF FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU AND THE WOMEN OF FALLING ILL OF JEALOUSY AT SEEING YOU SO LOVELY I MEANT PERSONS WHO WERE OUT IN THE STREETS OF ROME AH ASKED THE COUNTESS WHO IS OUT IN THE STREETS OF ROME AT THIS HOUR UNLESS
BUT ALSO THE CONDITIONS YOU MAKE WITH THEM WHAT CONDITIONS HAVE I FORGOTTEN YOUR EXCELLENCY INQUIRED THE BANDIT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO HAVING COMMITTED AN ERROR IS ANXIOUS TO REPAIR IT WAS IT NOT AGREED ASKED THE COUNT THAT NOT ONLY MY PERSON BUT ALSO THAT OF MY FRIENDS
LUIGI'S HANDS EXCELLENCY THE FRENCHMAN'S CARRIAGE PASSED SEVERAL TIMES THE ONE IN WHICH WAS TERESA THE CHIEF'S MISTRESS YES THE FRENCHMAN THREW HER A BOUQUET TERESA RETURNED IT ALL THIS WITH THE CONSENT OF THE CHIEF WHO WAS IN THE CARRIAGE
NO NOT PRECISELY HOWEVER I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING VERY LIKE A RENDEZVOUS DIAVOLO SAID THE DUKE THIS IS A BAD DAY OR RATHER A BAD NIGHT TO BE OUT LATE IS IT NOT COUNTESS THESE WORDS WERE ADDRESSED TO THE COUNTESS G
THE FRENCHMAN ASKED FOR A RENDEZVOUS
FRANZ FELT A SHUDDER RUN THROUGH HIS VEINS
LET US GO ON PEPPINO WILL HAVE WARNED THE SENTRY OF OUR COMING ONE OF THE TWO MEN WAS PEPPINO AND THE OTHER A BANDIT ON THE LOOKOUT FRANZ AND THE COUNT ADVANCED AND THE BANDIT SALUTED THEM YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID PEPPINO ADDRESSING THE COUNT
WHO WAS ON THE STEPS OF THE CHURCH OF SAN GIACOMO WHAT EXCLAIMED FRANZ THE PEASANT GIRL WHO SNATCHED HIS MOCOLETTO FROM HIM WAS A LAD OF FIFTEEN REPLIED PEPPINO BUT IT WAS NO DISGRACE TO YOUR FRIEND TO HAVE BEEN DECEIVED
FRANZ IMAGINED THAT HE SAW SOMETHING LIKE A SENTINEL
SEVEN MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI EIGHT EIGHT REPEATED BERTUCCIO STOP YOU ARE IN A SHOCKING HURRY TO BE OFF YOU FORGET ONE OF MY GUESTS LEAN A LITTLE TO THE LEFT
SAID THE COUNT SEVERELY I ORDERED DINNER AT THAT HOUR AND I DO NOT LIKE TO WAIT AND HE RETURNED TO HIS GUESTS WHILE BERTUCCIO LEANING AGAINST THE WALL SUCCEEDED IN REACHING THE DINING ROOM
I THINK I CAN EFFECTUALLY FORCE YOU AND MONTE CRISTO DREW ANOTHER PACKET FROM HIS POCKET HERE ARE TEN THOUSAND MORE FRANCS HE SAID WITH THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND ALREADY IN YOUR POCKET THEY WILL MAKE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
GLIDING DOWN THE STAIRS RESTORED BUT THE PREVIOUS DAY AS IF THEY HAD ALWAYS INHABITED THE HOUSE OTHERS FILLING THE COACH HOUSES WHERE THE EQUIPAGES ENCASED AND NUMBERED APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN INSTALLED FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS
THIS IS THE REASON THAT INSTEAD OF THE SIXTEEN I HAD LAST YEAR I HAVE THIS YEAR YOU SEE ELEVEN ALREADY PLUCKED TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AH I MISS THREE
THE TOWER CONTAINED IMPLEMENTS SUCH AS SPADES RAKES WATERING POTS HUNG AGAINST THE WALL THIS WAS ALL THE FURNITURE THE SECOND WAS THE MAN'S CONVENTIONAL ABODE OR RATHER SLEEPING PLACE
NO AND YET THEY REFUSED TO BUY IT WHY SAID CHATEAU RENAUD YOU PRETEND NOT TO KNOW
YOU LIVE BADLY ON YOUR THOUSAND FRANCS BADLY ENOUGH BUT YET I DO LIVE YES BUT YOU HAVE A WRETCHEDLY SMALL GARDEN TRUE THE GARDEN IS NOT LARGE
BY LOADING THE ANTE CHAMBERS STAIRCASES AND MANTLE PIECES WITH FLOWERS WHAT ABOVE ALL MANIFESTED THE SHREWDNESS OF THE STEWARD AND THE PROFOUND SCIENCE OF THE MASTER THE ONE IN CARRYING OUT THE IDEAS OF THE OTHER
NOTWITHSTANDING HIS SELF CONTROL WAS VISIBLY AFFECTED AND WHEN MONTE CRISTO TOUCHED HIS HAND HE FELT IT TREMBLE CERTAINLY WOMEN ALONE KNOW HOW TO DISSIMULATE SAID MONTE CRISTO TO HIMSELF GLANCING AT MADAME DANGLARS
WHOM WE ALSO KNOW THE THREE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE TALKING TOGETHER ON THE ENTRANCE OF THE NEW COMERS THEIR EYES GLANCED FROM FATHER TO SON AND THEN NATURALLY ENOUGH RESTED ON THE LATTER WHOM THEY BEGAN CRITICISING
AT THE SAME TIME TELLS MY RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT THAT I AM READY WHILE IT GIVES NOTICE TO MY LEFT HAND CORRESPONDENT TO PREPARE IN HIS TURN IT IS VERY INGENIOUS SAID THE COUNT
THE GARDEN WAS CROSSED BY A PATH OF RED GRAVEL EDGED BY A BORDER OF THICK BOX OF MANY YEARS GROWTH AND OF A TONE AND COLOR THAT WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED THE HEART OF DELACROIX OUR MODERN RUBENS
CAVALCANTI SAID DEBRAY A FINE NAME SAID MORREL YES SAID CHATEAU RENAUD THESE ITALIANS ARE WELL NAMED AND BADLY DRESSED YOU ARE FASTIDIOUS CHATEAU RENAUD REPLIED DEBRAY
WITH CORAL AND ENCRUSTED THEM WITH SHELLS THE WHOLE WAS CEMENTED BY TWO HUNDRED YEARS BENEATH THESE ALMOST IMPERVIOUS DEPTHS FOR A REVOLUTION CARRIED AWAY THE EMPEROR WHO WISHED TO MAKE THE TRIAL
THE MAN EXECUTED ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE THREE SIGNS GIVEN BY THE COUNT IN SPITE OF THE FRIGHTFUL CONTORTIONS OF THE RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT WHO NOT UNDERSTANDING THE CHANGE BEGAN TO THINK THE GARDENER HAD GONE MAD
MARVELLOUS ALIKE TO SIGHT AND SMELL WAS A BILLIARD TABLE WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN ABANDONED DURING THE PAST HOUR BY PLAYERS WHO HAD LEFT THE BALLS ON THE CLOTH ONE CHAMBER ALONE HAD BEEN RESPECTED BY THE MAGNIFICENT BERTUCCIO
TAKE THESE AND THE COUNT PLACED THE PACKET IN THE MAN'S HANDS NOW THIS IS NOT ALL HE SAID YOU CANNOT LIVE UPON YOUR FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS I SHALL STILL HAVE MY PLACE NO
AND THE SHAPE AND EXTENT OF THE LAWN WHICH WAS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE PAVING STONES THUS THE HOUSE HAD BECOME UNRECOGNIZABLE AND BERTUCCIO HIMSELF DECLARED THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW IT ENCIRCLED AS IT WAS BY A FRAMEWORK OF TREES
THAT IS TRUE SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I LIKE BEST SAID THE MAN SMILING WHY DO YOU LIKE THAT BEST BECAUSE THEN I HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY I AM A MACHINE THEN AND NOTHING ELSE AND SO LONG AS I WORK
ARE THEY GOING TO PUT HIM IN THE MINISTRY NOT YET I THINK MORE LIKELY HE HAS BEEN SPECULATING ON THE BOURSE AND HAS LOST MONEY
YOU WILL LOSE IT FOR YOU ARE GOING TO ALTER YOUR CORRESPONDENT'S MESSAGE OH SIR WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING A JEST SIR UNLESS YOU FORCE ME
BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI THAT TENDER FATHER WITH WHOM WE ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED CLOSE TO HIM DRESSED IN ENTIRELY NEW CLOTHES ADVANCED SMILINGLY COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI THE DUTIFUL SON
NOT ONE BORE THE MARK OF THE SLUG NOR WERE THERE EVIDENCES ANYWHERE OF THE CLUSTERING APHIS WHICH IS SO DESTRUCTIVE TO PLANTS GROWING IN A DAMP SOIL AND YET IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THE DAMP HAD BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE GARDEN THE EARTH
JUST SO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS DO YOU UNDERSTAND SIR LET ME SEE MY RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT ON THE CONTRARY DO NOT LOOK AT HIM BUT AT THIS WHAT IS IT WHAT
AND WON THE HEART OF THE GARDENER DID YOU COME HERE SIR TO SEE THE TELEGRAPH HE SAID YES IF IT ISN'T CONTRARY TO THE RULES OH NO SAID THE GARDENER NOT IN THE LEAST
STAY LOOK AT
WAS THAT THIS HOUSE WHICH APPEARED ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE SO SAD AND GLOOMY IMPREGNATED WITH THAT SICKLY SMELL ONE CAN ALMOST FANCY TO BE THE SMELL OF TIME HAD IN A SINGLE DAY ACQUIRED THE ASPECT OF LIFE
AND THEN SUCH AS IT IS IT IS FILLED WITH DORMICE WHO EAT EVERYTHING AH THEY ARE MY SCOURGES TELL ME SHOULD YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE TO TURN YOUR HEAD
MAKE FIFTEEN YOU ARE FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD HOW LONG MUST YOU HAVE SERVED TO CLAIM THE PENSION OH SIR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND HOW MUCH IS THE PENSION A HUNDRED CROWNS
TAKING THE ROAD TO ORLEANS LEAVING THE VILLAGE OF LINAS WITHOUT STOPPING AT THE TELEGRAPH WHICH FLOURISHED ITS GREAT BONY ARMS AS HE PASSED THE COUNT REACHED THE TOWER OF MONTLHERY
AND AT THE SAME MINUTE A CARRIAGE WITH SMOKING HORSES ACCOMPANIED BY TWO MOUNTED GENTLEMEN ARRIVED AT THE GATE WHICH OPENED BEFORE THEM THE CARRIAGE DROVE ROUND AND STOPPED AT THE STEPS FOLLOWED BY THE HORSEMEN
AND FASTENED WITH A NAIL AND STRING THE COUNT SOON MASTERED THE MECHANISM THE GATE OPENED AND HE THEN FOUND HIMSELF IN A LITTLE GARDEN ABOUT TWENTY FEET LONG BY TWELVE WIDE BOUNDED ON ONE SIDE BY PART OF THE HEDGE
I HAVE TEN LEFT SAID THE MAN FOR HERE ARE ELEVEN AND I HAD TWENTY ONE FIVE MORE THAN LAST YEAR BUT I AM NOT SURPRISED THE SPRING HAS BEEN WARM THIS YEAR AND STRAWBERRIES REQUIRE HEAT SIR
I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO THEM BUT THEY APPEAR TO SPEAK FRENCH WITH A VERY PURE ACCENT SAID DANGLARS THE SON HAS BEEN EDUCATED IN A COLLEGE IN THE SOUTH I BELIEVE NEAR MARSEILLES YOU WILL FIND HIM QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC
AT A BIRTHDAY FEAST THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF TELLING STRANGE THINGS IF IN ADDITION TO THE MENACING EARS WHICH THE PROVERB SAYS ALL WALLS ARE PROVIDED WITH IT HAD ALSO A VOICE
A PAUL POTTER
OR RATHER THERE IS NO TRUTH IN ANYTHING YOU HAVE TOLD ME IT WAS A FRIGHT OF THE IMAGINATION A DREAM OF YOUR FANCY YOU WENT TO SLEEP FULL OF THOUGHTS OF VENGEANCE THEY WEIGHED HEAVILY UPON YOUR STOMACH YOU HAD THE NIGHTMARE
A HUNDRED CROWNS YES SIR SO YOU SEE THAT I AM NOT LIKELY TO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS NOT EVEN FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WAGES COME IT IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT FOR FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
NOTHING VERY DIFFICULT BUT WHAT IS IT TO REPEAT THESE SIGNS MONTE CRISTO TOOK A PAPER FROM HIS POCKET UPON WHICH WERE DRAWN THREE SIGNS WITH NUMBERS TO INDICATE THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE TO BE WORKED
BUT OF TEN THREE ONLY REMAINED THE REST HAVING BEEN BROKEN BY THE WAVES I AM FOND OF THESE JARS UPON WHICH PERHAPS MISSHAPEN FRIGHTFUL MONSTERS HAVE FIXED THEIR COLD DULL EYES
PRICKED HIM DREADFULLY HE SHUDDERED AND RUBBED HIS EYES AS THOUGH AWAKING FROM A DREAM SIR SAID MONTE CRISTO TO HIM I DO NOT RECOMMEND MY PICTURES TO YOU WHO POSSESS SUCH SPLENDID PAINTINGS BUT NEVERTHELESS
PRESERVING THE SEEDS HE HAD LABELLED THEM WITH AS MUCH CARE AS IF HE HAD BEEN MASTER BOTANIST
YOU ARE FOND OF GARDENING PASSIONATELY AND YOU WOULD BE PLEASED TO HAVE INSTEAD OF THIS TERRACE OF TWENTY FEET AN ENCLOSURE OF TWO ACRES SIR I SHOULD MAKE A TERRESTRIAL PARADISE OF IT
A RAPHAEL A VANDYKE A ZURBARAN
DORMICE ARE BAD NEIGHBORS FOR US WHO DO NOT EAT THEM PRESERVED AS THE ROMANS DID WHAT DID THE ROMANS EAT THEM SAID THE GARDENER ATE DORMICE
NOTHING MORE IS REQUIRED OF ME IS IT POSSIBLE SAID MONTE CRISTO TO HIMSELF THAT I CAN HAVE MET WITH A MAN THAT HAS NO AMBITION THAT WOULD SPOIL MY PLANS SIR SAID THE GARDENER
AND HE GLANCED TIMIDLY AT THE COUNT'S BLUE COAT CALM YOURSELF MY FRIEND SAID THE COUNT WITH THE SMILE WHICH HE MADE AT WILL EITHER TERRIBLE OR BENEVOLENT AND WHICH NOW EXPRESSED ONLY THE KINDLIEST FEELING I AM NOT AN INSPECTOR
AND ACROSS THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE THEN REPRESSING A SLIGHT EMOTION WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN SEEN ON HER COUNTENANCE IF SHE HAD NOT KEPT HER COLOR SHE ASCENDED THE STEPS SAYING TO MORREL SIR
AND FASTENED THE STRING TO THE NAIL AND CAST A LOOK AROUND THE MAN AT THE TELEGRAPH SAID HE MUST EITHER ENGAGE A GARDENER OR DEVOTE HIMSELF PASSIONATELY TO AGRICULTURE
HOW A GARDENER MAY GET RID OF THE DORMICE THAT EAT HIS PEACHES NOT ON THE SAME NIGHT AS HE HAD INTENDED BUT THE NEXT MORNING THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO WENT OUT BY THE BARRIER D'ENFER
WHICH HE WAS PLACING UPON GRAPE LEAVES HE HAD TWELVE LEAVES AND ABOUT AS MANY STRAWBERRIES WHICH ON RISING SUDDENLY HE LET FALL FROM HIS HAND YOU ARE GATHERING YOUR CROP SIR SAID MONTE CRISTO SMILING
AND EMBRACING HIS WIFE AFTER A SHORT TIME THE COUNT SAW BERTUCCIO WHO UNTIL THEN HAD BEEN OCCUPIED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE GLIDE INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM HE WENT TO HIM
WHAT DID YOU SAY SIR ASKED THE MAN I WAS SAYING IT WAS VERY INTERESTING WHAT WAS ALL YOU WERE SHOWING ME AND YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND NONE OF THESE SIGNALS NONE AT ALL
WITH HIS EYES STARTING AND HIS HAIR ON END WAITING FOR WHOM BERTUCCIO WITHOUT ANSWERING
IF YOU HAD SEEN AT WHAT A PACE HE CAME LIKE THE WIND I SHOULD THINK SO A HORSE THAT COST FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS SAID MONTE CRISTO IN THE TONE WHICH A FATHER WOULD USE TOWARDS A SON
SHE GOT ME SOME MILK HALF CREAM I DO BELIEVE IT WAS SO NICE AND SOME OATCAKE AND WENT ON WITH HER WORK WHILE I ATE I REFLECTED THAT ANY MOMENT MISSUS MITCHELL MIGHT APPEAR TO DRAG ME BACK IN DISGRACE TO THAT HORRIBLE DEN
AT LENGTH I RECEIVED THIS LETTER FROM YOUR FRIEND WHICH STATES THAT MY FATHER IS IN PARIS AND AUTHORIZES ME TO ADDRESS MYSELF TO YOU FOR INFORMATION RESPECTING HIM
ASKED ANDREA WITH SOME UNEASINESS YES YOU WILL RECEIVE IT FROM YOUR FATHER PERSONALLY BUT LORD WILMORE WILL BE THE SECURITY FOR THE MONEY HE HAS AT THE REQUEST OF YOUR FATHER OPENED AN ACCOUNT OF SIX THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH
BY THE TIME I HAD BURROWED AS FAR AS I THOUGHT NECESSARY I WAS TIRED AND LAY DOWN AT FULL LENGTH IN MY HOLE DELIGHTING IN SUCH A SENSE OF SAFETY AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED
EXCLAIMED ANDREA EVIDENTLY CHARMED WITH THE IDEA OF HIS SPEEDY DEPARTURE THEREFORE SAID MONTE CRISTO FEIGNING TO MISTAKE HIS MEANING THEREFORE I WILL NOT FOR ANOTHER INSTANT RETARD THE PLEASURE OF YOUR MEETING ARE YOU PREPARED TO EMBRACE YOUR WORTHY FATHER
SHE ASKED NOW ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT READ I COULD REPEAT THE ALPHABET HOW I HAD LEARNED IT I DO NOT KNOW I DID REPEAT IT HOW MANY QUESTIONS OF YOUR CATECHISM CAN YOU SAY SHE ASKED NEXT
YOU SHOULD FURNISH HIM WITH SOME OF COURSE REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
MA FOI MONSIEUR YOU HAVE TOUCHED UPON A TENDER CHORD DO YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAYS MAJOR CERTAINLY I DO BUT DO YOU UNDERSTAND I DO YOUR SON SAYS HE REQUIRES MONEY WELL WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO SAID THE MAJOR
HE DEPUTES ME TO GIVE YOU THIS AM I TO CONSIDER THIS AS PART OF MY INCOME ON ACCOUNT NO IT IS FOR THE FIRST EXPENSES OF YOUR SETTLING IN PARIS AH HOW GOOD MY DEAR FATHER IS SILENCE SAID MONTE CRISTO
SHE WAS AS TALL AS MISSUS MITCHELL AND THAT WAS ENOUGH TO PREJUDICE ME AGAINST HER AT ONCE SHE WORE A CLOSE FITTING WIDOW'S CAP WITH A BLACK RIBBON ROUND IT HER HAIR WAS GREY AND HER FACE WAS AS GREY AS HER HAIR
AND THERE I BURST OUT SOBBING AND CRYING IT WAS ALL THE UTTERANCE I HAD LEFT AS SOON AS KIRSTY HAD SUCCEEDED IN CALMING ME I TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY SHE SAID VERY LITTLE BUT I COULD SEE SHE WAS VERY ANGRY NO DOUBT SHE WAS PONDERING WHAT COULD BE DONE
WHY AS TO THAT I THINK MY DEAR SON YOU MUST BE BY THIS TIME SO ACCUSTOMED TO FRANCE AS TO LOOK UPON IT ALMOST AS A SECOND COUNTRY THE FACT IS SAID THE YOUNG MAN THAT I SHOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY GRIEVED TO LEAVE IT
A MISERABLE OLD AGE AWAITS YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO BECOME RICH OR AT LEAST INDEPENDENT SET OUT IMMEDIATELY FOR PARIS AND DEMAND OF THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
BY THE MARCHESA CORSINARI AND WHO WAS TAKEN FROM YOU AT FIVE YEARS OF AGE THIS SON IS NAMED ANDREA CAVALCANTI IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY NOT DOUBT THE KIND INTENTION OF THE WRITER OF THIS LETTER YOU WILL FIND ENCLOSED AN ORDER FOR TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FRANCS
THE YOUNG MAN CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE MAJOR WHO HAD RISEN WHEN HE HEARD STEPS APPROACHING HIM AH MY DEAR FATHER SAID ANDREA IN A LOUD VOICE IN ORDER THAT THE COUNT MIGHT HEAR HIM IN THE NEXT ROOM IS IT REALLY YOU
WILL YOU NOT EMBRACE ME SIR SAID ANDREA IF YOU WISH IT MY SON SAID THE MAJOR AND THE TWO MEN EMBRACED EACH OTHER AFTER THE FASHION OF ACTORS ON THE STAGE THAT IS TO SAY EACH RESTED HIS HEAD ON THE OTHER'S SHOULDER
BUT IN DESPERATION I THREW MYSELF UPON HIM AND DUG MY NAILS INTO HIM THEY HAD FORTUNATELY FOUND THEIR WAY TO HIS EYES HE WAS THE VERIEST COWARD OF HIS SPECIES HE YELPED AND HOWLED AND STRUGGLING FROM MY GRASP RAN WITH HIS TAIL MERGED IN HIS PERSON BACK TO HIS MISTRESS
WELL MARQUIS SAID MONTE CRISTO YOU APPEAR TO BE IN NO WAY DISAPPOINTED IN THE SON WHOM YOUR GOOD FORTUNE HAS RESTORED TO YOU AH YOUR EXCELLENCY I AM OVERWHELMED WITH DELIGHT AND WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS SAID MONTE CRISTO TURNING TO THE YOUNG MAN
NOW REPLIED MONTE CRISTO THERE IS ONLY ONE SOURCE OF UNEASINESS LEFT IN YOUR FATHER'S MIND WHICH IS THIS HE IS ANXIOUS TO KNOW HOW YOU HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED DURING YOUR LONG ABSENCE FROM HIM HOW YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED BY YOUR PERSECUTORS
AND HAS HE CONFORMED TO ALL THAT THE LETTER SPECIFIED HE HAS DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT NOT IN THE LEAST THERE IS A DUPE SOMEWHERE AT ALL EVENTS IT IS NEITHER YOU NOR I CERTAINLY NOT WELL THEN
BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULD NOT DIVULGE A WORD OF THESE ADVENTURES YOUR HISTORY IS QUITE A ROMANCE AND THE WORLD WHICH DELIGHTS IN ROMANCES IN YELLOW COVERS STRANGELY MISTRUSTS THOSE WHICH ARE BOUND IN LIVING PARCHMENT EVEN THOUGH THEY BE GILDED LIKE YOURSELF
BUT SAID ANDREA IF MY FATHER HAD MET ME I DOUBT IF HE WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED ME I MUST BE SOMEWHAT ALTERED SINCE HE LAST SAW ME OH THE VOICE OF NATURE SAID MONTE CRISTO TRUE INTERRUPTED THE YOUNG MAN I HAD NOT LOOKED UPON IT IN THAT LIGHT
FROM A CERTAIN ABBE BUSONI HAVE YOU ANY KNOWLEDGE OF HIM NO I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM WHAT DID HE SAY IN THE LETTER YOU WILL PROMISE NOT TO BETRAY ME REST ASSURED OF THAT YOU WELL KNOW THAT OUR INTERESTS ARE THE SAME
YOU THINK THEN THAT I MAY RELY ON THE COUNT'S PROMISES CERTAINLY I DO YOU ARE SURE HE WILL KEEP HIS WORD WITH ME TO THE LETTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME REMEMBER WE MUST CONTINUE TO PLAY OUR RESPECTIVE PARTS I AS A TENDER FATHER
HE IS THEN THE SAME ENGLISHMAN WHOM I MET
BUT A DREARY LITTLE HOUSE WITH NOTHING GREEN TO COVER THE BROWN STONES OF WHICH IT WAS BUILT AND HAVING AN OPEN DITCH IN FRONT OF IT WITH A STONE SLAB OVER IT FOR A BRIDGE DID I SAY THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE WALLS THIS MORNING THERE WAS THE LOVELIEST SUNSHINE
THE LESS PRETENSION THERE IS IN YOUR ATTIRE THE BETTER WILL BE THE EFFECT AS YOU ARE A RICH MAN IF YOU MEAN TO BUY ANY HORSES GET THEM OF DEVEDEUX AND IF YOU PURCHASE A PHAETON GO TO BAPTISTE FOR IT AT WHAT HOUR SHALL WE COME ASKED THE YOUNG MAN ABOUT HALF PAST SIX
TAKEN AWAY BY THE TREACHERY OF MY TUTOR SO THAT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I HAVE NOT SEEN THE AUTHOR OF MY EXISTENCE SINCE I HAVE ARRIVED AT YEARS OF DISCRETION AND BECOME MY OWN MASTER I HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY SEEKING HIM BUT ALL IN VAIN
THEN THERE IS NO LONGER ANY SUCH THING IN ITALY AS BEING CONDEMNED TO THE GALLEYS THE MAJOR DREW HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT
A DESCENDANT OF THE CAVALCANTI WHOSE NAMES ARE INSCRIBED IN THE GOLDEN BOOK AT FLORENCE OUR FAMILY ALTHOUGH STILL RICH FOR MY FATHER'S INCOME AMOUNTS TO HALF A MILLION HAS EXPERIENCED MANY MISFORTUNES AND I MYSELF WAS AT THE AGE OF FIVE YEARS
WITH WHICH SHE PROCEEDED TO CHASTISE HIM AS HIS FIRST CRY REACHED MY EARS I WAS HALFWAY TO THE DOOR ON THE THRESHOLD I STUMBLED AND FELL
PAYABLE IN FLORENCE AT SIGNOR GOZZI'S ALSO A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO ON WHOM I GIVE YOU A DRAFT OF FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS
AND WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH PLAINLY DENOTED AN UNUSUAL INTEREST IN THE CONTENTS WHEN HE HAD PERUSED THE DOCUMENTS AN INDEFINABLE EXPRESSION OF PLEASURE LIGHTED UP HIS COUNTENANCE AND LOOKING AT THE MAJOR WITH A MOST PECULIAR SMILE HE SAID IN VERY EXCELLENT TUSCAN
HE IS A MILLIONAIRE HIS INCOME IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THEN SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH ANXIETY I SHALL BE SURE TO BE PLACED IN AN AGREEABLE POSITION ONE OF THE MOST AGREEABLE POSSIBLE MY DEAR SIR
I MEAN THAT IF THERE WERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAW UP WITH IMPUNITY TWO SUCH DEEDS AS THESE IN FRANCE MY DEAR SIR HALF SUCH A PIECE OF EFFRONTERY AS THAT WOULD CAUSE YOU TO BE QUICKLY DESPATCHED TO TOULON FOR FIVE YEARS FOR CHANGE OF AIR
THEN IN THAT CASE I SHALL ALWAYS CHOOSE TO REMAIN THERE YOU CANNOT CONTROL CIRCUMSTANCES MY DEAR SIR MAN PROPOSES AND GOD DISPOSES ANDREA SIGHED BUT SAID HE
WHO WAS HOBBLING AFTER ME BUT WITH THE RENEWED STRENGTH OF TRIUMPH I TURNED AGAIN FOR HOME AND RAN AS I HAD NEVER RUN BEFORE WHEN OR WHERE THE DAME GAVE IN I DO NOT KNOW
WELL IT IS ONE OF HIS DESCENDANTS AND A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE HE IS A VERY RICH ENGLISHMAN ECCENTRIC ALMOST TO INSANITY AND HIS REAL NAME IS LORD WILMORE AH INDEED THEN THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY SAID ANDREA
AS STANDING ON ONE LEG THE OTHER WAS SO MUCH SHORTER SHE MOVED IT TO AND FRO OVER THE GARMENT ON THE TABLE THEN SHE CALLED ME TO HER BY NAME IN A WOULD BE POMPOUS MANNER I OBEYED TREMBLING CAN YOU SAY YOUR LETTERS
WHEN I HAD FINISHED AND KIRSTY HAD LEFT THE KITCHEN FOR A MOMENT I SPED NOISELESSLY TO THE DOOR AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE FARMYARD THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN DARK AND BROWN AND COOL THE DOOR OF THE BARN STOOD OPEN AS IF INVITING ME TO SHELTER AND SAFETY

AND HEREDITARY WORTH AND EVEN TO INCREASE THE VALUE IF POSSIBLE I HAVE THEREFORE RECEIVED A VERY GOOD EDUCATION AND HAVE BEEN TREATED BY THESE KIDNAPPERS VERY MUCH AS THE SLAVES WERE TREATED IN ASIA MINOR WHOSE MASTERS MADE THEM GRAMMARIANS DOCTORS AND PHILOSOPHERS
SHOULD YOU LIKE TO BE RICH AND YOUR OWN MASTER MA FOI SAID THE YOUNG MAN WAS IT POSSIBLE THERE COULD BE TWO ANSWERS TO SUCH A QUESTION TAKE THE POST CHAISE WHICH YOU WILL FIND WAITING AT THE PORTE DE GENES AS YOU ENTER NICE
I KNEW THAT KIRSTY'S AUTHORITY WAS NOT EQUAL TO HERS AND THAT SHE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO GIVE ME UP SO I WATCHED AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE ONCE MORE AND HIDE MYSELF SO THAT KIRSTY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE I WAS
AND FROM PONT DE BEAUVOISIN TO PARIS INDEED THEN YOUR FATHER OUGHT TO HAVE MET WITH YOU ON THE ROAD FOR IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME ROUTE WHICH HE HIMSELF TOOK AND THAT IS HOW WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRACE YOUR JOURNEY TO THIS PLACE

UPON BEING PRESENTED TO THEIR GUESTS RUTH BRAYTON WAS IN A SUNNY MOOD LAUGHING GAYLY AS SHE CHATTED WITH THE BOYS TAD GLANCED AT HER INQUIRINGLY SHE WAS NOT THE SAME GIRL THAT HE HAD MET THE DAY BEFORE THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN THE EYES TOO
THE PONY STRUCK THE GROUND ON ITS LEFT SIDE WITH A BUMP THAT MADE THE ANIMAL GRUNT TAD HOWEVER FOREWARNED HAD FREED HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIRRUP AND WAS STANDING EASILY OVER HIS FALLEN MOUNT EYES FIXED ON THE BEAST'S EARS
DOWN CAME THE QUIRT AGAIN THE BRONCHO'S HEAD STRAIGHTENED OUT BEFORE HIM WITH AMAZING QUICKNESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEAR AS WELL AS HATE THE HUMAN BEING WHO SO PERSISTENTLY SAT HIS BACK AND TORTURED HIM THE PONY SPRANG INTO THE AIR THEY'RE OFF SHOUTED THE COWBOYS
FORTUNATELY THE LAD GRIPPED THE POMMEL WITH HIS RIGHT HAND AS HE FELT HIMSELF GOING AND LITTLE BY LITTLE HE PULLED HIMSELF ONCE MORE TO AN UPRIGHT POSTURE ALL AT ONCE THE ANIMAL TOOK A LEAP INTO THE AIR COMING DOWN HEADED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION

THE PORTLY SERVING MAN HAD ADVANCED AND TAKING HIS LITTLE MISTRESS IN HIS ARMS AS HE WOULD A CHILD HAD PLANTED HER ON THE STEPS AND THEN HER LADYSHIP'S CLEAR SHRILL AND NOW RATHER FRETFUL VOICE WAS HEARD HERE WHERE'S THE BUTLER
SHAKING THE GOLDEN RIBAND OF HER EMERALD BONNET AND ADJUSTING THE GLITTERING PELERINE OF POINT DEVICE THAT SHADED THE FALL OF HER BROAD BUT WELL FORMED SHOULDERS IN ONE HAND THE STATELY DAME LIGHTLY SWUNG A BAG THAT WAS WORTHY OF HOLDING THE GREAT SEAL ITSELF

THAT SURELY WOULD NOT BE WRONG UNDER THE CHARM OF THE EVENING HIS MIND SOON DRIFTED INTO OTHER CHANNELS AFTER SUPPER GAMES WERE BROUGHT OUT AND A HAPPY EVENING FOLLOWED TEN O'CLOCK CAME AND PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH WAS ABOUT TO PROPOSE A RETURN TO CAMP
AND LEAST OF ALL A MERE BOY ALL AT ONCE THE ANIMAL CAME UP ON ITS HIND LEGS TAD KNEW INSTINCTIVELY WHAT IT MEANT
IN THEIR MINDS THEY COULD SEE THE HARDY COWBOYS RIDING IN FRONT OF THE UNREASONING ANIMALS SHOOTING INTO THE GROUND IN FRONT OF THEM SEEKING TO CHECK THE RUSH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS BUSINESS ASKED TAD BUTLER DRAWING UP BESIDE NED RECTOR I THINK THERE IS MORE IN THIS SPOOK STORY THAN COLONEL MC CLURE KNOWS OF
THE JOLT MIGHT HAVE UNHORSED TAD BUTLER HAD HE NOT BEEN EXPECTING IT FROM SOME INDICATIONS THAT HE READ IN THE ANIMAL'S ACTIONS SUDDENLY SETTLING BACK ON ITS HAUNCHES THE BRONCHO ROLLED OVER ON ITS SIDE TAD WITH A GRIN STEPPED OFF A FEW PACES
THE PONY RIDER BOYS CAUGHT THE HIDDEN MEANING IN HIS WORDS BUT THEY TRIED NOT TO LET THEIR HOSTS OBSERVE THAT IT WAS A JOKE AT THE EXPENSE OF ONE OF THEM STALLINGS MURMURED MISS BRAYTON HER EYES STARING VACANTLY AT TAD BUTLER
READY TO RESUME HIS POSITION AT THE FIRST SIGN OF A QUIVER OF THOSE EARS LIKE A FLASH THE ANIMAL WAS ON ITS FEET AGAIN BUT WITH TAD RIDING IN THE SADDLE A SATISFIED SMILE ON HIS FACE ONCE MORE THE AWFUL NERVE RACKING BUCKING BEGAN

ESPECIALLY WERE THEIR HOSTS INTERESTED IN THE STORY OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE LOST CLAIM WHICH THE BOYS HAD FOUND ON THEIR TRIP IN THE ROCKIES I HAVE WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE OLD CHURCH BETWEEN HERE AND CAMP MISTER MC CLURE
I WONDER IF SHE KNOWS MISTER STALLINGS MUSED TAD I'M GOING TO FIND OUT NO I WON'T IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS STILL IT WILL DO NO HARM TO ASK HIM OR TO MENTION THE NAME TO HIM
BUT THIS TIME TAD PRESSED IN THE SPURS ON THE RIGHT SIDE THE PONY TRIED TO BITE THAT WAY WHEREAT ITS RIDER SPURRED IT ON THE LEFT SIDE THIS WAS CONTINUED UNTIL AT LEAST IN SHEER DESPERATION THE ANIMAL STARTED AGAIN TO RUN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS NOT INTERFERED WITH IN THIS EFFORT

SOON AS THE WATER DOTH BEGIN TO RUN NO MORE BENACO IS IT CALLED BUT MINCIO FAR AS GOVERNO WHERE IT FALLS IN PO NOT FAR IT RUNS BEFORE IT FINDS A PLAIN IN WHICH IT SPREADS ITSELF AND MAKES IT MARSHY
FOR ALL UPON ONE SIDE TOWARDS THE CASTLE THEIR FACES HAVE AND GO UNTO SAINT PETER'S ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY GO TOWARDS THE MOUNTAIN THIS SIDE AND THAT ALONG THE LIVID STONE BEHELD I HORNED DEMONS WITH GREAT SCOURGES
WHO BY HIS HEART AND CUNNING THE COLCHIANS OF THE RAM MADE DESTITUTE HE BY THE ISLE OF LEMNOS PASSED ALONG AFTER THE DARING WOMEN PITILESS HAD UNTO DEATH DEVOTED ALL THEIR MALES THERE WITH HIS TOKENS AND WITH ORNATE WORDS DID HE DECEIVE HYPSIPYLE

BUT ON THE BORDER DID NOT DRAG ITS TAIL THE FACE WAS AS THE FACE OF A JUST MAN ITS SEMBLANCE OUTWARDLY WAS SO BENIGN AND OF A SERPENT ALL THE TRUNK BESIDE TWO PAWS IT HAD HAIRY UNTO THE ARMPITS
WE THEREFORE ON THE RIGHT SIDE DESCENDED AND MADE TEN STEPS UPON THE OUTER VERGE COMPLETELY TO AVOID THE SAND AND FLAME AND AFTER WE ARE COME TO HIM I SEE A LITTLE FARTHER OFF UPON THE SAND A PEOPLE SITTING NEAR THE HOLLOW PLACE
AND THE CITY OF BACCHUS HAD BECOME ENSLAVED SHE A LONG SEASON WANDERED THROUGH THE WORLD ABOVE IN BEAUTEOUS ITALY LIES A LAKE AT THE ALP'S FOOT THAT SHUTS IN GERMANY OVER TYROL AND HAS THE NAME BENACO

AFTER I THIS HAD ALL FROM ME UNLOOSED AS MY CONDUCTOR HAD COMMANDED ME I REACHED IT TO HIM GATHERED UP AND COILED WHEREAT HE TURNED HIMSELF TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE VERGE HE CAST IT DOWN INTO THAT DEEP ABYSS
HIS TAIL WAS WHOLLY QUIVERING IN THE VOID CONTORTING UPWARDS THE ENVENOMED FORK THAT IN THE GUISE OF SCORPION ARMED ITS POINT THE GUIDE SAID NOW PERFORCE MUST TURN ASIDE OUR WAY A LITTLE

MUCH LESS PAIN TWILL GIVE US IF THOU DO EAT OF US THYSELF DIDST CLOTHE US WITH THIS POOR FLESH AND DO THOU STRIP IT OFF I CALMED ME THEN NOT TO MAKE THEM MORE SAD
IS NOT BELOW HERE EVERY VAPOUR QUENCHED
SO LOUD IT WOULD HAVE MADE EACH THUNDER FAINT WHICH COUNTER TO IT FOLLOWING ITS WAY MINE EYES DIRECTED WHOLLY TO ONE PLACE AFTER THE DOLOROUS DISCOMFITURE
SAVE THAT HE SEEMS IN ASPECT MORE FEROCIOUS THERE NEVER WAS AN EARTHQUAKE OF SUCH MIGHT THAT IT COULD SHAKE A TOWER SO VIOLENTLY
WHEN CHARLEMAGNE THE HOLY EMPRISE LOST SO TERRIBLY ORLANDO SOUNDED NOT SHORT WHILE MY HEAD TURNED THITHERWARD I HELD WHEN MANY LOFTY TOWERS I SEEMED TO SEE WHEREAT I
WHEN IS DREAMING OF GLEANING OFTENTIMES THE PEASANT GIRL LIVID AS FAR DOWN AS WHERE SHAME APPEARS WERE THE DISCONSOLATE SHADES WITHIN THE ICE SETTING THEIR TEETH UNTO THE NOTE OF STORKS
THAT FROM THE FROST THE SEMBLANCE HAD OF GLASS AND NOT OF WATER SO THICK A VEIL NE'ER MADE UPON ITS CURRENT IN WINTER TIME DANUBE IN AUSTRIA NOR THERE BENEATH THE FRIGID SKY THE DON
OF A SMALL RIVULET THAT THERE DESCENDETH
WELL SHALT THOU SEE IF THOU ARRIVEST THERE HOW MUCH THE SENSE DECEIVES ITSELF BY DISTANCE THEREFORE A LITTLE FASTER SPUR THEE ON
SUCH DID ANTAEUS SEEM TO ME WHO STOOD WATCHING TO SEE HIM STOOP AND THEN IT WAS I COULD HAVE WISHED TO GO SOME OTHER WAY BUT LIGHTLY IN THE ABYSS WHICH SWALLOWS UP JUDAS WITH LUCIFER

ITSELF DOWN RUSHES INTO SUCH A CISTERN AND STILL PERCHANCE ABOVE APPEARS THE BODY OF YONDER SHADE THAT WINTERS HERE BEHIND ME THIS THOU SHOULDST KNOW IF THOU HAST JUST COME DOWN
SAID THIS WITH HIS EYES DISTORTED THE WRETCHED SKULL RESUMED HE WITH HIS TEETH WHICH AS A DOG'S UPON THE BONE WERE STRONG AH PISA
SHOWED SO MUCH OF HIM ABOVE IT THAT TO REACH UP TO HIS HAIR
TILL I BEHELD THROUGH A ROUND APERTURE SOME OF THE BEAUTEOUS THINGS THAT HEAVEN DOTH BEAR
TURNED TO THE LEFT AND A CROSSBOW SHOT OFT WE FOUND ANOTHER FAR MORE FIERCE AND LARGE IN BINDING HIM WHO MIGHT THE MASTER BE I CANNOT SAY BUT HE HAD PINIONED CLOSE BEHIND THE RIGHT ARM AND IN FRONT THE OTHER
THE WAY IS LONG AND DIFFICULT THE ROAD AND NOW THE SUN TO MIDDLE TIERCE RETURNS IT WAS NOT ANY PALACE CORRIDOR THERE WHERE WE WERE BUT DUNGEON NATURAL
AND AS ANNE ASSURED DIANA EVERY SUCCEEDING THRILL WAS THRILLIER THAN THE LAST WHEN PRISSY ANDREWS ATTIRED IN A NEW PINK SILK WAIST WITH A STRING OF PEARLS ABOUT HER SMOOTH WHITE THROAT AND REAL CARNATIONS IN HER HAIR
HERE LET US LEAVE HIM AND NOT SPEAK IN VAIN FOR EVEN SUCH TO HIM IS EVERY LANGUAGE AS HIS TO OTHERS WHICH TO NONE IS KNOWN THEREFORE A LONGER JOURNEY DID WE MAKE
OH MARILLA WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW TOMORROW IS DIANA'S BIRTHDAY WELL HER MOTHER TOLD HER SHE COULD ASK ME TO GO HOME WITH HER FROM SCHOOL AND STAY ALL NIGHT WITH HER
TO WHICH WERE NOT BEFITTING SWEETER PSALMS
AND BORE THE NAME OF SASSOL MASCHERONI WELL KNOWEST THOU WHO HE WAS IF THOU ART TUSCAN AND THAT THOU PUT ME NOT TO FURTHER SPEECH KNOW THAT I
WHEN WE WERE COME TO WHERE THE THIGH REVOLVES EXACTLY ON THE THICKNESS OF THE HAUNCH THE GUIDE WITH LABOUR AND WITH HARD DRAWN BREATH

THEY WEPT AND DARLING LITTLE ANSELM MINE SAID THOU DOST GAZE SO FATHER WHAT DOTH AIL THEE STILL NOT A TEAR I SHED NOR ANSWER MADE ALL OF THAT DAY
WITH CHAINS THAT HELD HIM SO BEGIRT ABOUT FROM THE NECK DOWN THAT ON THE PART UNCOVERED IT WOUND ITSELF AS FAR AS THE FIFTH GYRE THIS PROUD ONE WISHED TO MAKE EXPERIMENT OF HIS OWN POWER AGAINST THE SUPREME JOVE
SOUL IDIOTIC KEEP TO THY HORN AND VENT THYSELF WITH THAT WHEN WRATH OR OTHER PASSION TOUCHES THEE SEARCH ROUND THY NECK
NOW WAS I AND WITH FEAR IN VERSE I PUT IT THERE WHERE THE SHADES WERE WHOLLY COVERED UP
PANTING AS ONE FATIGUED MUST WE PERFORCE DEPART FROM SO MUCH EVIL THEN THROUGH THE OPENING OF A ROCK HE ISSUED AND DOWN UPON THE MARGIN SEATED ME
THEY ALL CROWDED INTO THE BIG PUNG SLEIGH AMONG STRAW AND FURRY ROBES
DRAW NIGH THAT I MAY TAKE THEE THEN OF HIMSELF AND ME ONE BUNDLE MADE AS SEEMS THE CARISENDA TO BEHOLD BENEATH THE LEANING SIDE WHEN GOES A CLOUD ABOVE IT SO THAT OPPOSITE IT HANGS
BUT A FLORENTINE THOU SEEMEST TO ME TRULY WHEN I HEAR THEE THOU HAST TO KNOW I WAS COUNT UGOLINO AND THIS ONE WAS RUGGIERI THE ARCHBISHOP NOW I WILL TELL THEE WHY I AM SUCH A NEIGHBOUR
BEING OF BOTH DEPRIVED THE EMPEROR OF THE KINGDOM DOLOROUS FROM HIS MID BREAST FORTH ISSUED FROM THE ICE AND BETTER WITH A GIANT I COMPARE THAN DO THE GIANTS WITH THOSE ARMS OF HIS
BECAUSE THE EARLIEST TEARS A CLUSTER FORM AND IN THE MANNER OF A CRYSTAL VISOR FILL ALL THE CUP BENEATH THE EYEBROW FULL AND NOTWITHSTANDING THAT AS IN A CALLUS
STILL FIXED REMAINETH AS HE WAS BEFORE UPON THIS SIDE HE FELL DOWN OUT OF HEAVEN
E'EN THUS THE MARGIN WHICH SURROUNDS THE WELL WITH ONE HALF OF THEIR BODIES TURRETED THE HORRIBLE GIANTS WHOM JOVE MENACES E'EN NOW FROM OUT THE HEAVENS WHEN HE THUNDERS
I WOULD PRESS OUT THE JUICE OF MY CONCEPTION MORE FULLY BUT BECAUSE I HAVE THEM NOT NOT WITHOUT FEAR I BRING MYSELF TO SPEAK
THEREBY
MASTER SAY WHAT TOWN IS THIS AND HE TO ME BECAUSE THOU PEEREST FORTH ATHWART THE DARKNESS AT TOO GREAT A DISTANCE
AND ONE WHO HAD BY REASON OF THE COLD LOST BOTH HIS EARS STILL WITH HIS VISAGE DOWNWARD SAID WHY DOST THOU SO MIRROR THYSELF IN US IF THOU DESIRE TO KNOW WHO THESE TWO ARE
THAN THAT ONE DID THE SKULL AND THE OTHER THINGS
OTHER PEOPLE'S CHEEKS SO THAT IF THOU WERT LIVING TWERE TOO MUCH LIVING I AM AND DEAR TO THEE IT MAY BE WAS MY RESPONSE IF THOU DEMANDEST FAME THAT MID THE OTHER NOTES THY NAME I PLACE
I GUESS ONCE IS ENOUGH TO SAY THEM
HE WEEPETH HERE THE SILVER OF THE FRENCH I SAW
NOR YET THE NIGHT THEREAFTER UNTIL ANOTHER SUN ROSE ON THE WORLD AS NOW A LITTLE GLIMMER MADE ITS WAY INTO THE DOLOROUS PRISON
SIGHED ANNE RAPTUROUSLY IT MUST BE SPLENDID TO GET UP AND RECITE THERE DO YOU SUPPOSE WE WILL EVER BE ASKED TO DO IT DIANA YES OF COURSE SOMEDAY THEY'RE ALWAYS WANTING THE BIG SCHOLARS TO RECITE
LOOKING AT PRISSY ANDREWS AT THE END OF EVERY SENTENCE ANNE FELT THAT SHE COULD RISE AND MUTINY ON THE SPOT IF BUT ONE ROMAN CITIZEN LED THE WAY ONLY ONE NUMBER ON THE PROGRAM FAILED TO INTEREST HER WHEN GILBERT BLYTHE RECITED
SHE AND DIANA TALKED SO CONSTANTLY ABOUT IT ALL DAY THAT WITH A STRICTER TEACHER THAN MISTER PHILLIPS DIRE DISGRACE
AND THE FLOWER BEDS TRAMPLED INTO SHAPELESS MASSES BY THIRTY TWO LITTLE FEET THAT RAN ABOUT FROM MORN TILL NIGHT BUT THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT COMPLAIN AT THIS
AND ALINE WOULD NEVER LIKE HER THOUGH MISSUS GARDNER MIGHT BE WON ALTOGETHER ANNE SIGHED WITH RELIEF WHEN THE ORDEAL WAS OVER OF ALL SAD WORDS OF TONGUE OR PEN THE SADDEST ARE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUOTED PRISCILLA TRAGICALLY LIFTING THE CUSHION
IT SEEMS JUST YESTERDAY THAT PRIS AND I WERE ALONE IN THAT CROWD OF FRESHMEN AT REDMOND AND NOW WE ARE SENIORS IN OUR FINAL EXAMINATIONS POTENT WISE AND REVEREND SENIORS QUOTED PHIL DO YOU SUPPOSE WE REALLY ARE ANY WISER THAN WHEN WE CAME TO REDMOND
SO LIKE A MAN THOUGHT ANNE SCORNFULLY SHALL YOU BE HOME SATURDAY AFTERNOON ASKED ROY YES MY MOTHER AND SISTERS ARE COMING TO CALL ON YOU SAID ROY QUIETLY SOMETHING WENT OVER ANNE WHICH MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS A THRILL
SOLUS ALONE ALONE IN THE COLD AFTER DINNER SIT A WHILE AFTER SUPPER WALK A MILE AND EVERY MEAL'S A SUPPER TO THE HOBO J
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT OUT OF YOUR REDMOND COURSE ANNE MURMURED PRISCILLA ASIDE I THINK SAID ANNE SLOWLY THAT I REALLY HAVE LEARNED TO LOOK UPON EACH LITTLE HINDRANCE AS A JEST AND EACH GREAT ONE AS THE FORESHADOWING OF VICTORY
THEN A FLIGHT OF ARROWS CAME FROM THE BUSHES AND ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BLUNT AND COULD DO HIM NO HARM THEY RATTLED ALL OVER HIS BODY AND ONE HIT HIS NOSE AND ANOTHER HIS CHIN WHILE SEVERAL STUCK FAST IN THE LOAVES OF BREAD ALTOGETHER THE BAKER MAN WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
SHE HAD NEVER MET ANY OF ROY'S FAMILY SHE REALIZED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIS STATEMENT AND IT HAD SOMEHOW AN IRREVOCABLENESS ABOUT IT THAT CHILLED HER I SHALL BE GLAD TO SEE THEM SHE SAID FLATLY AND THEN WONDERED IF SHE REALLY WOULD BE GLAD SHE OUGHT TO BE OF COURSE
RUSTY AND JOSEPH LEFT TO THEMSELVES BEGAN A GAME OF CHASE AND SPRANG MADLY INTO MISSUS GARDNER'S SILKEN LAP AND OUT OF IT IN THEIR WILD CAREER MISSUS GARDNER LIFTED HER LORGNETTE
THIS CAKE IS NOW WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A FLAT FAILURE AND THE CUSHION IS LIKEWISE RUINED NEVER TELL ME THAT FRIDAY ISN'T UNLUCKY PEOPLE WHO SEND WORD THEY ARE COMING ON SATURDAY SHOULDN'T COME ON FRIDAY SAID AUNT JAMESINA
BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THEM SETTLED IN THEIR NEW HOME WHEN MARGARET ANOTHER OF HER DAUGHTERS DIED AND SENT FOUR MORE CHILDREN TO HER MOTHER TO BE TAKEN CARE OF THE OLD WOMAN SCARCELY KNEW WHERE TO KEEP THIS NEW FLOCK THAT HAD COME TO HER FOLD
YOU WILL REALIZE WHAT A LARGE FAMILY THE OLD WOMAN HAD AND HOW FULLY HER TIME WAS OCCUPIED IN CARING FOR THEM ALL AND NOW TO MAKE THE MATTER WORSE HER FOURTH DAUGHTER WHO HAD BEEN NAMED ABIGAIL SUDDENLY TOOK SICK AND DIED AND SHE
THE HOUSE PRESENTED A VERY QUEER APPEARANCE NOW BUT SHE DID NOT MIND THAT SO LONG AS THE BABIES WERE COMFORTABLE I SHALL NOT HAVE TO BUILD AGAIN SHE SAID AND THAT IS ONE SATISFACTION I HAVE NOW NO MORE DAUGHTERS TO DIE AND LEAVE ME THEIR CHILDREN
THERE ARE SO MANY CHILDREN SHE SAID ONE DAY TO THE BAKER MAN THAT I OFTEN REALLY DO N'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
LET'S ALL GO UP TOWN AND GET DRUNK SUGGESTED PHIL I AM GOING TO SQUANDER IT IN A WILD SOULLESS REVEL OF SOME SORT DECLARED ANNE GAILY AT ALL EVENTS IT ISN'T TAINTED MONEY LIKE THE CHECK I GOT FOR THAT HORRIBLE RELIABLE BAKING POWDER STORY
AND THEN ALL SIXTEEN WENT OUT AND HID IN THE BUSHES NEAR THE TOP OF THE HILL BY AND BY THE BAKER MAN CAME SLOWLY UP THE PATH WITH A BASKET OF BREAD ON EITHER ARM AND JUST AS HE REACHED THE BUSHES THERE SOUNDED IN HIS EARS A MOST UNEARTHLY WAR WHOOP
PRISCILLA CAME DOWN APRONLESS AND SMUDGELESS STELLA REDUCED HER CORNER TO DECENCY AND PHIL SAVED THE SITUATION BY A STREAM OF READY SMALL TALK MISSUS GARDNER WAS TALL AND THIN AND HANDSOME EXQUISITELY GOWNED CORDIAL WITH A CORDIALITY THAT SEEMED
AND ANY ONE WHO HASN'T CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT IT IS SO THERE IS NO NEED OF DEFINING IT THE BUSY DAYS FLEW BY AND EXAMINATIONS WERE OVER ANNE TOOK HIGH HONORS IN ENGLISH PRISCILLA TOOK HONORS IN CLASSICS AND PHIL IN MATHEMATICS
OF COURSE IT WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE NINE SMALL CHILDREN THAN FIVE AND THEY OFTEN LED EACH OTHER INTO MISCHIEF SO THAT THE FLOWER BEDS BEGAN TO BE TRAMPLED UPON AND THE GREEN GRASS TO BE WORN UNDER THE CONSTANT TREAD OF LITTLE FEET
STELLA OBTAINED A GOOD ALL ROUND SHOWING THEN CAME CONVOCATION THIS IS WHAT I WOULD ONCE HAVE CALLED AN EPOCH IN MY LIFE SAID ANNE AS SHE TOOK ROY'S VIOLETS OUT OF THEIR BOX AND GAZED AT THEM THOUGHTFULLY SHE MEANT TO CARRY THEM OF COURSE
THE CHILDREN LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN SURPRISE FOR THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE BREAD AND THEN ONE OF THEM CONFESSED AND TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY OF HOW THEY HAD FRIGHTENED THE BAKER MAN FOR SAYING HE WOULD SEND THEM TO THE POOR HOUSE
WE'VE LEARNED THE TRUTH OF WHAT PROFESSOR WOODLEIGH TOLD US LAST PHILOMATHIC SAID PHIL HE SAID HUMOR IS THE SPICIEST CONDIMENT IN THE FEAST OF EXISTENCE LAUGH AT YOUR MISTAKES BUT LEARN FROM THEM JOKE OVER YOUR TROUBLES BUT GATHER STRENGTH FROM THEM
ALSO HAD FOUR SMALL CHILDREN THAT MUST BE CARED FOR IN SOME WAY THE OLD WOMAN HAVING TAKEN THE OTHER TWELVE COULD NOT WELL REFUSE TO ADOPT THESE LITTLE ORPHANS ALSO I MAY AS WELL HAVE SIXTEEN AS A DOZEN SHE SAID WITH A SIGH
MEANING MONEY AN INVENTION FOR BURNING MONEY INCOME THE RELIABLE OFFSPRING OF A WISE INVESTMENT FROM LAT IN
AND HAS MARRIED THEM ALL HAPPILY SHE IS SURELY ENTITLED TO PASS HER REMAINING DAYS IN PEACE AND COMFORT SHE LIVED IN A PECULIAR LITTLE HOUSE THAT LOOKED SOMETHING LIKE THIS PICTURE
FROM JOG TO MOVE SLOWLY AND KEY SOMETHING THAT MAKES FAST HENCE ONE WHO MAKES THE PACE FAST OR SLOW ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS JOINT EITHER A LOW LIMB
OR FALLING DOWN AND HURTING THEMSELVES AND THESE HAD TO BE COMFORTED AND SOME WERE NAUGHTY AND HAD TO BE WHIPPED AND SOME WERE DIRTY AND HAD TO BE WASHED AND SOME WERE GOOD AND HAD TO BE KISSED IT WAS GRAN'MA DO THIS AND GRAN'MA DO THAT FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
FROM THE BUTCHER OR A LOW QUARTER IN TOWN IN EITHER CASE THE LOWER THE TOUGHER JOKE A FORM OF HUMOR ENJOYED BY SOME AND MISUNDERSTOOD BY MOST IN ENGLAND REQUIRING A DIAGRAM
WELL I SUPPOSE THE LORD DOESN'T REGARD THE EARS OF A MAN SAID AUNT JAMESINA GRAVELY DROPPING ALL FURTHER CRITICISM OF MOODY SPURGEON
COLLEGE CIRCLES EXPECTED THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HER ENGAGEMENT TO ROY ANY DAY ANNE EXPECTED IT HERSELF YET JUST BEFORE SHE LEFT PATTY'S PLACE FOR CONVOCATION SHE FLUNG ROY'S VIOLETS ASIDE AND PUT GILBERT'S LILIES OF THE VALLEY IN THEIR PLACE
A WARM PLUMMY ODOR FILLED THE WHOLE HOUSE FOR PRISCILLA WAS COOKING IN THE KITCHEN PRESENTLY SHE CAME IN ENSHROUDED IN A HUGE WORK APRON WITH A SMUDGE OF FLOUR ON HER NOSE
MY DAUGHTER USED TO WRITE STORIES BEFORE SHE WENT TO THE FOREIGN FIELD BUT NOW SHE HAS TURNED HER ATTENTION TO HIGHER THINGS SHE USED TO SAY HER MOTTO WAS NEVER WRITE A LINE YOU WOULD BE ASHAMED TO READ AT YOUR OWN FUNERAL YOU'D BETTER TAKE THAT FOR YOURS ANNE
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX THE GARDNERS'CALL HERE IS A LETTER WITH AN INDIAN STAMP FOR YOU AUNT JIMSIE SAID PHIL HERE ARE THREE FOR STELLA AND TWO FOR PRIS AND A GLORIOUS FAT ONE FOR ME FROM JO
YOU WON'T FAIL HOW DID YOU GET ON IN GREEK TODAY I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WAS A GOOD PAPER AND PERHAPS IT WAS BAD ENOUGH TO MAKE HOMER TURN OVER IN HIS GRAVE I'VE STUDIED AND MULLED OVER NOTEBOOKS UNTIL I'M INCAPABLE OF FORMING AN OPINION OF ANYTHING
MEANING A LOAD PACKED ON THE OUTSIDE OF A VAN IN AMERICA THE LOAD IS PACKED ON THE INSIDE OF A MAN
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO BE THE ICEMAN IDIOT
THAT OF THE BREATHLESS MOMENT WHEN THE STATELY PRESIDENT OF REDMOND GAVE HER CAP AND DIPLOMA AND HAILED HER B A IT WAS NOT OF THE FLASH IN GILBERT'S EYES WHEN HE SAW HER LILIES NOR THE PUZZLED PAINED GLANCE ROY GAVE HER AS HE PASSED HER ON THE PLATFORM
ONE ENERGETIC TWIST AND IT GAVE WAY ANNE THRUST THE BROKEN TRINKET INTO HER POCKET HER HANDS WERE TREMBLING AND HER EYES WERE SMARTING BUT SHE WAS THE GAYEST OF ALL THE GAY REVELLERS THAT NIGHT AND TOLD GILBERT UNREGRETFULLY
OR DOROTHY'S ARDENT IMPULSIVE GOOD WISHES IT WAS OF ONE STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE PANG THAT SPOILED THIS LONG EXPECTED DAY FOR HER AND LEFT IN IT A CERTAIN FAINT BUT ENDURING FLAVOR OF BITTERNESS
JACK POT AN INSTRUMENT REQUIRING A STRONG HAND AND USED FOR RAISING HEAVY BETS OR FOR PULLING OFF THE STAKES JAG FROM THE SPANISH WORD ZAGA
THE WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE SHE HAD SO MANY CHILDREN
AN IMPLEMENT EMPLOYED BY MEN OF ACQUISITIVE NATURES WHO CANNOT AFFORD SEATS IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE JOB AN UNCERTAIN COMMODITY REGULATED BY A UNION CARD JOCKEY
YOU DON'T ACT AS IF YOU WERE BY TIMES SAID AUNT JAMESINA SEVERELY OH AUNT JIMSIE HAVEN'T WE BEEN PRETTY GOOD GIRLS TAKE US BY AND LARGE THESE THREE WINTERS YOU'VE MOTHERED US PLEADED PHIL
AND WHEN ALL THE SIXTEEN SMALL INDIANS RUSHED FROM THE BUSHES AND FLOURISHED THEIR TOMAHAWKS HE TOOK TO HIS HEELS AND RAN DOWN THE HILL AS FAST AS HE COULD GO WHEN THE GRANDMOTHER RETURNED SHE ASKED WHERE IS THE BREAD FOR YOUR SUPPER
BUT IT WAS A GOOD AND WHOLESOME DIET AND THE CHILDREN THRIVED AND GREW FAT UPON IT ONE DAY A STRANGER CAME ALONG THE ROAD AND WHEN HE SAW THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE HE BEGAN TO LAUGH WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT SIR
BUT HER EYES WANDERED TO ANOTHER BOX ON HER TABLE IT WAS FILLED WITH LILIES OF THE VALLEY AS FRESH AND FRAGRANT AS THOSE WHICH BLOOMED IN THE GREEN GABLES YARD WHEN JUNE CAME TO AVONLEA
IF YOU ARE GOING TO EMBARK IN LITERATURE THOUGH TO BE SURE ADDED
AND SOON PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO LOOK AT THE QUEER HOUSE AND THEY USUALLY WENT AWAY LAUGHING THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT MIND THIS AT ALL SHE WAS TOO BUSY TO BE ANGRY
YOU ARE SIXTEEN VERY NAUGHTY CHILDREN EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN AND FOR PUNISHMENT YOU MUST EAT YOUR BROTH WITHOUT ANY BREAD AND AFTERWARDS EACH ONE SHALL HAVE A SOUND WHIPPING AND BE SENT TO BED THEN ALL THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO CRY AT ONCE
TO SHOW AUNT JAMESINA THE CHOCOLATE CAKE SHE HAD JUST ICED AT THIS AUSPICIOUS MOMENT THE KNOCKER SOUNDED NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO IT SAVE PHIL WHO SPRANG UP AND OPENED IT EXPECTING A BOY WITH THE HAT SHE HAD BOUGHT THAT MORNING
SO THAT THE POOR GRANDMOTHER WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED THE ONLY PEACE SHE EVER GOT WAS WHEN THEY WERE ALL SAFELY TUCKED IN THEIR LITTLE COTS AND WERE SOUND ASLEEP FOR THEN AT LEAST SHE WAS FREE FROM WORRY AND HAD A CHANCE TO GATHER HER SCATTERED WITS
NO SAID ANNE I THINK IT'S TRUE SAID PHIL LIGHTLY ANNE DID NOT SPEAK IN THE DARKNESS SHE FELT HER FACE BURNING SHE SLIPPED HER HAND INSIDE HER COLLAR AND CAUGHT AT THE GOLD CHAIN
THERE IS SO MUCH IN THE WORLD FOR US ALL IF WE ONLY HAVE THE EYES TO SEE IT AND THE HEART TO LOVE IT AND THE HAND TO GATHER IT TO OURSELVES SO MUCH IN MEN AND WOMEN SO MUCH IN ART AND LITERATURE SO MUCH EVERYWHERE IN WHICH TO DELIGHT
ANNE SCRAMBLED TO HER FEET SOMEHOW EMPTYING TWO INDIGNANT CATS OUT OF HER LAP AS SHE DID SO AND MECHANICALLY SHIFTING HER WISHBONE FROM HER RIGHT HAND TO HER LEFT PRISCILLA WHO WOULD HAVE HAD TO CROSS THE ROOM TO REACH THE KITCHEN DOOR LOST HER HEAD
I HAVE NEVER LIKED CATS SAID MISSUS GARDNER REMOTELY I LOVE THEM SAID DOROTHY THEY ARE SO NICE AND SELFISH DOGS ARE TOO GOOD AND UNSELFISH THEY MAKE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE BUT CATS ARE GLORIOUSLY HUMAN
GILBERT HAD CALLED HER CARROTS AND VAINLY TRIED TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH A PINK CANDY HEART HAD WRITTEN HIM A NICE LITTLE NOTE OF THANKS BUT SHE HAD NEVER WORN THE TRINKET TONIGHT SHE FASTENED IT ABOUT HER WHITE THROAT WITH A DREAMY SMILE SHE AND PHIL WALKED TO REDMOND TOGETHER

GRIEF DOES NOT STUN ME I HAVE NOT BEEN IN BED FOR TWO NIGHTS BUT THEN LOOK AT MY DESK SEE WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN DURING THESE TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS I HAVE FILLED THOSE PAPERS AND HAVE MADE OUT THE ACCUSATION AGAINST THE ASSASSIN BENEDETTO
SHALL YOU BE PRESENT IN THE RECEPTION ROOM NO I HAVE A COUSIN WHO HAS UNDERTAKEN THIS SAD OFFICE I SHALL WORK DOCTOR
HE THOUGHT CYNICALLY HOW COMPLETELY HE WAS LACKING IN ALL HUMAN SYMPATHY O HENRY HAD FOUND IN THESE PEOPLE ROMANCE PATHOS LOVE HATE AMORY SAW ONLY COARSENESS PHYSICAL FILTH AND STUPIDITY HE MADE NO SELF ACCUSATIONS
WE NEED NOT SAY THAT A SMILE OF CONDESCENSION WAS STAMPED UPON HIS LIPS GOOD MORNING CREDITOR SAID HE FOR I WAGER ANYTHING IT IS THE CREDITOR WHO VISITS ME
THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE DURING WHICH THE NOISE OF THE BANKER'S PEN WAS ALONE HEARD WHILE MONTE CRISTO EXAMINED THE GILT MOULDINGS ON THE CEILING ARE THEY SPANISH HAITIAN
THE CHARITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES TO YOU THROUGH ME THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS DEPUTE ME TO RECEIVE ALMS TO THE AMOUNT OF FIVE MILLIONS FROM YOU
WANT TO GO DOWN THERE AND SEE IF IT'S DIRTY FRENCH RIVERS ALL BROWN OR BLACK SO WERE SOUTHERN RIVERS TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS MEANT FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOUGHNUTS HE COULD LIVE ON IT THREE MONTHS AND SLEEP IN THE PARK WONDER WHERE JILL WAS JILL BAYNE FAYNE
AND ADVANCED TO MEET HIM WITH A SAD THOUGH AFFABLE SMILE WELL SAID HE EXTENDING HIS HAND TO MONTE CRISTO
HOW SO THE COUNT HAS AN UNLIMITED CREDIT UPON ME A CREDIT OPENED BY THOMSON AND FRENCH OF ROME HE CAME TO DEMAND FIVE MILLIONS AT ONCE WHICH I PAID HIM WITH CHECKS ON THE BANK MY FUNDS ARE DEPOSITED THERE AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
ARE YOU THEN PRESSED FOR THIS MONEY YES FOR THE EXAMINATION OF OUR CASH TAKES PLACE TO MORROW TO MORROW WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME SO BEFORE WHY IT IS AS GOOD AS A CENTURY AT WHAT HOUR DOES THE EXAMINATION TAKE PLACE AT TWO O'CLOCK
AFTER EXPRESSING ACUTE SYMPATHY WITH THE FATHER
FOOL THEN ENCLOSING MONTE CRISTO'S RECEIPT IN A LITTLE POCKET BOOK HE ADDED YES COME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK I SHALL THEN BE FAR AWAY THEN HE DOUBLE LOCKED HIS DOOR EMPTIED ALL HIS DRAWERS COLLECTED ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS IN BANK NOTES
CERTAINLY IT WILL ONLY COST YOU A DISCOUNT OF FIVE THOUSAND OR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS THE RECEIVER STARTED BACK MA FOI HE SAID I PREFER WAITING TILL TO MORROW WHAT A PROPOSITION
JUST PASSIVELY AFRAID QUESTION
AND WHO DID NOT EXACT A MOURNFUL FACE OR FORCE TEARS AS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE WITH A FATHER A BROTHER OR A LOVER
NEVER ANY MORE DID HE REPROACH HIMSELF FOR FEELINGS THAT WERE NATURAL AND SINCERE HE ACCEPTED ALL HIS REACTIONS AS A PART OF HIM UNCHANGEABLE UNMORAL THIS PROBLEM OF POVERTY TRANSFORMED MAGNIFIED ATTACHED TO SOME GRANDER
IF IT WASN'T APPENDICITIS INFLUENZA MAYBE WHAT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTIETH STREET
IF A THUNDERBOLT HAD FALLEN AT THE BANKER'S FEET
THAT I HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS TO MY NAME QUESTION
MORE DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE MIGHT SOME DAY EVEN BE HIS PROBLEM AT PRESENT IT ROUSED ONLY HIS PROFOUND DISTASTE HE WALKED OVER TO FIFTH AVENUE DODGING THE BLIND BLACK MENACE OF UMBRELLAS AND STANDING IN FRONT OF DELMONICO'S HAILED AN AUTO BUS
TAKE IT TO ROTHSCHILD'S OR LAFITTE'S AND THEY WILL TAKE IT OFF YOUR HANDS AT ONCE
YOU THEREFORE STILL OWE ME FIVE MILLIONS AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS I WILL TAKE THE FIVE SCRAPS OF PAPER THAT I NOW HOLD AS BONDS WITH YOUR SIGNATURE ALONE AND HERE IS A RECEIPT IN FULL FOR THE SIX MILLIONS BETWEEN US
IF YOU WISHED TO DEMOLISH THEM YOU COULD NOT AND IF IT WERE POSSIBLE YOU WOULD NOT DARE
FOR WHAT REASON BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT SPEND MONEY SO GUILTILY ACQUIRED
HE STOOD ASIDE EDGED A LITTLE INTO THE RAIN TO LET THE THRONG PASS A SMALL BOY RUSHED OUT SNIFFED IN THE DAMP FRESH AIR AND TURNED UP THE COLLAR OF HIS COAT CAME THREE OR FOUR COUPLES IN A GREAT HURRY
EVERYTHING AND INDEED NO SOONER HAD THE DOCTOR LEFT THE ROOM THAN HE WAS AGAIN ABSORBED IN STUDY
NONE I'VE NO MORE VIRTUE TO LOSE JUST AS A COOLING POT GIVES OFF HEAT SO ALL THROUGH YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE WE GIVE OFF CALORIES OF VIRTUE THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED INGENUOUSNESS QUESTION AN INTERESTING IDEA
CAME A FURTHER SCATTERING OF PEOPLE WHOSE EYES AS THEY EMERGED GLANCED INVARIABLY FIRST AT THE WET STREET THEN AT THE RAIN FILLED AIR FINALLY AT THE DISMAL SKY LAST A DENSE STROLLING MASS
I THINK I ARRIVED JUST IN TIME TO OBTAIN YOUR SIGNATURES OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DISPUTED WITH ME
AND THE NUMEROUS UNPLEASANT ASPECTS OF CITY LIFE WITHOUT MONEY OCCURRED TO HIM IN THREATENING PROCESSION THERE WAS THE GHASTLY STINKING CRUSH OF THE SUBWAY THE CAR CARDS THRUSTING THEMSELVES AT ONE LEERING OUT LIKE DULL BORES WHO GRAB YOUR ARM WITH ANOTHER STORY
THEY ARE GONE TO SEEK A VERY STRICT CONVENT IN ITALY OR SPAIN
IT IS ONE OF THE BEST HOUSES IN EUROPE SAID DANGLARS CARELESSLY THROWING DOWN THE RECEIPT ON HIS DESK AND HE HAD FIVE MILLIONS IN YOUR HANDS ALONE WHY THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO MUST BE A NABOB INDEED I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS
THEY'RE WARMING THEMSELVES AT HER VIRTUE BUT SARAH SEES THE SIMPER AND NEVER MAKES THAT REMARK AGAIN ONLY SHE FEELS A LITTLE COLDER AFTER THAT QUESTION ALL YOUR CALORIES GONE
LEAVING HARD BROWN DEPOSITS IN THE BOWL IT WAS NOT SO BAD WHERE THERE WERE ONLY MEN OR ELSE ONLY WOMEN IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE VILELY HERDED THAT IT ALL SEEMED SO ROTTEN IT WAS SOME SHAME THAT WOMEN GAVE OFF AT HAVING MEN SEE THEM TIRED AND POOR
THERE IS STILL A SUM OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS OH A MERE NOTHING SAID MONTE CRISTO THE BALANCE WOULD COME TO ABOUT THAT SUM BUT KEEP IT AND WE SHALL BE QUITS COUNT SAID DANGLARS ARE YOU SPEAKING SERIOUSLY
SO YOUNG SO RICH SO BEAUTIFUL COULD YOU HAVE IMAGINED THIS SCENE CHATEAU RENAUD WHEN WE SAW HER AT THE MOST THREE WEEKS AGO ABOUT TO SIGN THAT CONTRACT INDEED NO SAID CHATEAU RENAUD DID YOU KNOW HER
DANGLARS SIGNATURE THE NEXT MORNING DAWNED DULL AND CLOUDY DURING THE NIGHT THE UNDERTAKERS HAD EXECUTED THEIR MELANCHOLY OFFICE AND WRAPPED THE CORPSE IN THE WINDING SHEET
OWN TASTE THE BEST ISABELLE CLARA ROSALIND ELEANOR WERE ALL AMERICAN ELEANOR WOULD PITCH PROBABLY SOUTHPAW ROSALIND WAS OUTFIELD WONDERFUL HITTER CLARA FIRST BASE MAYBE
FROM TWELVE TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS BUT TO RETURN TO OUR MILLIONS
SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE INSULT OFFERED TO US BY THAT WRETCH SO SHE ASKED PERMISSION TO TRAVEL AND IS SHE GONE THE OTHER NIGHT SHE LEFT
AND WHO BOWED TO ME AS THOUGH HE KNEW ME
NO SAID MONTE CRISTO FOLDING THE FIVE NOTES MOST DECIDEDLY NOT THE THING IS SO CURIOUS I WILL MAKE THE EXPERIMENT MYSELF I AM CREDITED ON YOU FOR SIX MILLIONS I HAVE DRAWN NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
HE SLEEPS INDEED AND THIS IS THE MORE STRANGE SINCE THE LEAST CONTRADICTION KEEPS HIM AWAKE ALL NIGHT
TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK PLEASE PAY TO MY ORDER FROM THE FUND DEPOSITED BY ME THE SUM OF A MILLION AND CHARGE THE SAME TO MY ACCOUNT BARON DANGLARS
AH YOU ARE LAUGHING AT ME SEND TO MORROW AT TWELVE AND THE BANK SHALL BE NOTIFIED I WILL COME MYSELF BETTER STILL SINCE IT WILL AFFORD ME THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU THEY SHOOK HANDS
AND THEY BOTH RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY TO THE PROCUREUR'S STUDY
AND SAYING SOMETHING TO HIS COMPANION WITH A LOOK OF UTTER DISGUST PROBABLY THOUGHT AMORY WHAT HE SAID WAS MY GOD AREN'T PEOPLE HORRIBLE NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD AMORY CONSIDERED POOR PEOPLE
WONDER WHAT HUMBIRD'S BODY LOOKED LIKE NOW IF HE HIMSELF HADN'T BEEN BAYONET INSTRUCTOR HE'D HAVE GONE UP TO LINE THREE MONTHS SOONER PROBABLY BEEN KILLED WHERE'S THE DARNED BELL
ONE O TWO INSTEAD OF ONE TWO SEVEN ROSALIND NOT LIKE BEATRICE ELEANOR LIKE BEATRICE ONLY WILDER AND BRAINIER APARTMENTS ALONG HERE EXPENSIVE PROBABLY HUNDRED AND FIFTY A MONTH MAYBE TWO HUNDRED
HOW THE SMELL OF IT HAD SUDDENLY CLEARED THE AIR AND GIVEN EVERY ONE IN THE CAR A MOMENTARY GLOW I DETEST POOR PEOPLE THOUGHT AMORY SUDDENLY I HATE THEM FOR BEING POOR POVERTY MAY HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL ONCE BUT IT'S ROTTEN NOW
FIVE MILLIONS HERE IS HIS RECEIPT BELIEVE YOUR OWN EYES
AS THOUGH TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER HE SPOKE SERIOUSLY YES HE ANSWERED IF A FORTUNE BRINGS CONSOLATION I OUGHT TO BE CONSOLED I AM RICH
I WAS DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED AT FIRST AND FELT AS IF I WERE BEING SLOWLY STIFLED
AND SHINE IN THINE OWN SPLENDOUR
IN ITS OWN ESSENCE THE HIGHEST GOOD AND MOST JUSTLY SAID I BUT THE HIGHEST GOOD HAS BEEN ADMITTED TO BE HAPPINESS YES THEN SAID SHE
WHICH ON ANOTHER SIDE BOUNDED THE CORN YARD THERE WAS THE MOON CRESCENT AS I SAW HER IN MY DREAM BUT LOW DOWN TOWARDS THE HORIZON AND LYING ALMOST UPON HER ROUNDED BACK SHE LOOKED VERY DISCONSOLATE AND DIM
THE STARS WERE HIGH UP AWAY IN THE HEAVENS THEY DID NOT LOOK LIKE THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN AND MOON AT ALL AND THEY TOOK NO HEED OF ME YET THERE WAS A GRANDEUR IN MY DESOLATION THAT WOULD HAVE ELEVATED MY HEART BUT FOR THE FEAR
HOW CAN WE DOUBT HIM TO BE GOOD THAN WHOM THERE IS NOTHING BETTER NOW REASON SHOWS GOD TO BE GOOD IN SUCH WISE AS TO PROVE THAT IN HIM IS PERFECT GOOD FOR WERE IT NOT SO
ALONE THERE LAY THE AWFULNESS OF IT I HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN WHAT THE NIGHT WAS THE REAL STING OF ITS FEAR LAY IN THIS THAT THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE IN IT
MY HEART SANK TOTALLY WITHIN ME I COULD BEAR NO MORE I FELL DOWN ON THE BED WEEPING BITTERLY AND WEPT MYSELF ASLEEP
WHAT IS THAT SAID I IS THERE AUGHT THINKEST THOU AMID THESE MORTAL AND PERISHABLE THINGS WHICH CAN PRODUCE A STATE SUCH AS THIS NAY SURELY NOT
MY IDEA OF HIM WAS NOT LIKE HIM IT WAS MERELY A CONFUSED MIXTURE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FANCIES ABOUT HIM AND MY OWN I HAD NOT LEARNED HOW BEAUTIFUL GOD IS
SINCE WE ARE SPEAKING OF GOD WHO IS SUPREME OF ALL THINGS WHO WAS THERE TO JOIN THESE DISTINCT ESSENCES FINALLY WHEN ONE THING IS DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER THE THINGS SO CONCEIVED AS DISTINCT
WE OUGHT EVEN IN THE MOST TRIVIAL MATTERS TO IMPLORE THE DIVINE PROTECTION WHAT THINKEST THOU SHOULD WE NOW DO IN ORDER TO DESERVE TO FIND THE SEAT OF THAT HIGHEST GOOD
AND MUST PUNISH THEM TO MAKE THEM GOOD WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM NOW IN THE SILENT STARRY NIGHT A YET GREATER TERROR SEIZED ME AND I RAN STUMBLING OVER THE UNEVEN FIELD DOES MY READER
OVER WHOSE DEFEAT HOWEVER I REJOICED WITH THE PRIDE OF A DRAGON SLAYER
HITHER COME ALL YE WHOSE MINDS LUST WITH ROSY FETTERS BINDS LUST TO BONDAGE HARD COMPELLING
FOUND ME FAST ASLEEP ON HIS SO FAST THAT HE UNDRESSED ME AND LAID ME IN THE BED WITHOUT MY ONCE OPENING MY EYES THE MORE STRANGE AS I HAD ALREADY SLEPT SO LONG BUT SORROW IS VERY SLEEPY
WONDER WHITHER I FLED WHITHER SHOULD I FLY BUT HOME TRUE MISSUS MITCHELL WAS THERE BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER THERE AS WELL EVEN KIRSTY WOULD NOT DO IN THIS TERROR HOME WAS THE ONLY REFUGE
SINCE NOW THOU HAST SEEN WHAT IS THE FORM OF THE IMPERFECT GOOD AND WHAT THE FORM OF THE PERFECT ALSO
OF GLORY OR OF PLEASURE FOR SINCE EACH ONE OF THESE SEVERALLY IS IDENTICAL WITH THE REST WHOSOEVER SEEKS ANY ONE OF THEM WITHOUT THE OTHERS
HE DOES INDEED WISH FOR HAPPINESS AS A WHOLE BUT WILL HE FIND IT IN THESE THINGS WHICH AS WE HAVE PROVED
EACH TO ITS STARRY CAR AFFIXING
IT IS MANIFEST THAT THEY BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF GODSHIP BUT AS BY THE ACQUISITION OF JUSTICE MEN BECOME JUST AND WISE BY THE ACQUISITION OF WISDOM
AND SO COMES TO APPEAR SOMEWHAT POOR IN ESTEEM I CANNOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEING WHAT IT IS THIS UNION OF QUALITIES IS ALSO RIGHT FAMOUS IT FOLLOWS THEN
SINCE THERE ARE NO PORTIONS BUT ALSO THE WHOLE TO WHICH IT DOES NOT DREAM OF ASPIRING HOW SO SAID I HE WHO TO ESCAPE WANT SEEKS RICHES GIVES HIMSELF NO CONCERN ABOUT POWER
BUT HAD IN THE COURSE OF A HUNDRED YEARS GROWN INTO THE GRIMMEST LARGEST MOST GROTESQUE TREES I HAVE EVER SEEN OF THE KIND I HAD ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE AFRAID OF THEM EVEN IN THE DAYTIME BUT THEY DID ME NO HURT
TO WHICH THEY GIVE THE NAME DEDUCTIONS SO WILL I ADD HERE A SORT OF COROLLARY FOR SINCE MEN BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF HAPPINESS WHILE HAPPINESS IS VERY GODSHIP
I DREW NEARER THE PLACE OF POSSIBLE REFUGE ROSE BEFORE ME I STOOD ON THE GRASS PLOT IN FRONT OF IT THERE WAS NO LIGHT IN ITS EYES ITS MOUTH WAS CLOSED IT WAS SILENT AS ONE OF THE RICKS
THE NATURE OF INDEPENDENCE AND POWER IS ONE AND THE SAME IT SEEMS SO WELL BUT DOST THINK THAT ANYTHING OF SUCH A NATURE AS THIS CAN BE LOOKED UPON WITH CONTEMPT
BUT THE TRUE AND PERFECT GOOD THEY CANNOT BESTOW EVEN SO SAID I SINCE THEN THOU HAST LEARNT WHAT THAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS AND WHAT MEN FALSELY CALL HAPPINESS
THIS CLEFT IN TWAIN AND IN TWO CIRCLES GATHERED SPEEDS IN A PATH THAT ON ITSELF RETURNS ENCOMPASSING MIND'S LIMITS AND CONFORMS THE HEAVENS TO HER TRUE SEMBLANCE
EVEN THINGS WHICH BY NATURE ARE NOT GOOD ARE DESIRED AS IF THEY WERE TRULY GOOD IF THEY SEEM TO BE SO
THIS ALSO IS NECESSARY THAT INDEPENDENCE POWER RENOWN REVERENCE AND SWEETNESS OF DELIGHT ARE DIFFERENT ONLY IN NAME BUT IN SUBSTANCE DIFFER NO WISE ONE FROM THE OTHER
DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT FOR IF THOU DEEMEST IT RECEIVED FROM WITHOUT THOU MAYST ESTEEM THAT WHICH GIVES MORE EXCELLENT THAN THAT WHICH HAS RECEIVED
AND THE DESOLATION OF THIS NIGHT WAS MY KEY TO THAT DREAM ONCE MORE I AWOKE TO A SENSE OF MISERY AND STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS CRYING PAPA PAPA THE SAME MOMENT I FOUND MY FATHER'S ARMS AROUND ME
OR HATH IT AS A NATURAL ENDOWMENT IN SUCH SORT THAT THOU MIGHTEST CONSIDER THE ESSENCE OF THE HAPPINESS POSSESSED
OR RATHER FAMOUS IN ALL RENOWN JUST CONSIDER CAN THAT WANT RENOWN WHICH HAS BEEN AGREED TO BE LACKING IN NOTHING TO BE SUPREME IN POWER
BUT HIM WE MOST WORTHILY ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE THE MOST SUPREMELY EXCELLENT OF ALL THINGS IF HOWEVER IT IS IN HIM BY NATURE YET IS LOGICALLY DISTINCT THE THOUGHT IS INCONCEIVABLE
IT IS UTTERLY INCONCEIVABLE HOW THAT SO CALLED IM PERFECTION SHOULD COME INTO EXISTENCE NATURE DOES NOT MAKE A BEGINNING WITH THINGS MUTILATED AND IMPERFECT
IT SEEMED AS IF IN THE AGONY OF THEIR TALK THEIR COUNTENANCES WOULD GO TO PIECES FOR THE STARS THEY DARTED ABOUT HITHER AND THITHER GATHERED INTO GROUPS DISPERSED AND FORMED NEW GROUPS
BEING THYSELF MOST BEAUTIFUL SO THOU THE WORK DIDST FASHION IN THAT FAIR LIKENESS BIDDING IT PUT ON PERFECTION THROUGH THE EXQUISITE PERFECTNESS OF EVERY PART'S CONTRIVANCE
HE PREFERS A MEAN AND LOW ESTATE AND ALSO DENIES HIMSELF MANY PLEASURES DEAR TO NATURE TO AVOID LOSING THE MONEY WHICH HE HAS GAINED BUT AT THIS RATE HE DOES NOT EVEN ATTAIN TO INDEPENDENCE
BETWEEN THEIR TOPS I SAW ONLY STARS AND DARKNESS I TURNED AND LOOKED BACK INTO THE BARN IT APPEARED A HORRIBLE CAVE FILLED WITH DARKNESS I REMEMBERED THERE WERE RATS IN IT
AND CONCLUDE THESE THREE TO BE ONE WE MUST IF WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH THINKEST THOU THEN THIS COMBINATION OF QUALITIES TO BE OBSCURE AND WITHOUT DISTINCTION
I POSSESSED MY WITS SUFFICIENTLY TO RUN FIRST TO KIRSTY'S PRESS AND SECURE A GOOD SUPPLY OF OATCAKE WITH WHICH I THEN SPED LIKE A HUNTED HARE TO HER FORM
HOW ANY SADNESS CAN FIND ENTRANCE INTO SUCH A STATE WHEREFORE I MUST NEEDS ACKNOWLEDGE IT FULL OF JOY AT LEAST IF OUR FORMER CONCLUSIONS ARE TO HOLD THEN FOR THE SAME REASONS
BUT DEEP SET WITHIN THY INMOST BEING THE FORM OF PERFECT GOOD FROM ENVY FREE AND THOU DIDST MOULD THE WHOLE TO THAT SUPERNAL PATTERN BEAUTEOUS THE WORLD IN THEE THUS IMAGED
SO IT COMES TO PASS THAT WHENEVER IMPERFECTION IS FOUND IN ANY PARTICULAR THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE A PERFECTION IN RESPECT OF THAT PARTICULAR ALSO FOR WERE THERE NO SUCH PERFECTION
THESE BY A LAW BENIGN THOU BIDDEST TURN AGAIN
NOW THAT FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH ANYTHING IS DESIRED ITSELF SEEMS TO BE MOST WISHED FOR FOR INSTANCE IF ANYONE WISHES TO RIDE FOR THE SAKE OF HEALTH HE DOES NOT SO MUCH WISH FOR THE EXERCISE OF RIDING
IS ONE AND THE SAME I CANNOT SEE HOW ANYONE CAN DISSENT FROM THESE CONCLUSIONS
BUT WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS THE PERFECT GOOD THEREFORE TRUE HAPPINESS MUST DWELL IN THE SUPREME DEITY I ACCEPT THY REASONINGS SAID I
EVERYBODY BESIDES ME WAS ASLEEP ALL OVER THE WORLD AND HAD ABANDONED ME TO MY FATE WHATEVER MIGHT COME OUT OF THE DARKNESS TO SEIZE ME WHEN I GOT ROUND THE EDGE OF THE STONE WALL
THAT WHICH IS SIMPLE AND INDIVISIBLE BY NATURE HUMAN ERROR SEPARATES AND TRANSFORMS FROM THE TRUE AND PERFECT TO THE FALSE AND IMPERFECT DOST THOU IMAGINE THAT WHICH LACKETH NOTHING CAN WANT POWER
OR IS THERE SOME ONE OF THEM WHICH FORMS THE FULL ESSENCE OF HAPPINESS WHILE ALL THE REST ARE RELATIVE TO THIS I WOULD THOU WOULDST UNFOLD THE WHOLE MATTER TO ME AT LARGE
WE MUST INVOKE THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS SAID I FOR WITHOUT THIS NO ENTERPRISE SETS OUT FROM A RIGHT BEGINNING
AND DOWN THEIR EYELIDS WINKED AND WINKED AND THEIR CHEEKS PUCKERED AND RELAXED INCESSANTLY THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE STORM OF EXPRESSION UPON THEIR FACES THEIR VERY NOSES TWISTED AND CURLED
NO VOICE CAME IN REPLY AND THE PLACE WAS YET MORE SILENT THAN THE NIGHT OR THE HALL HE MUST BE ASLEEP I WAS AFRAID TO CALL LOUDER
THAT IS TRUE AND PERFECT HAPPINESS WHICH CROWNS ONE WITH THE UNION OF INDEPENDENCE POWER REVERENCE RENOWN AND JOY AND TO PROVE TO THEE WITH HOW DEEP AN INSIGHT I HAVE LISTENED SINCE ALL THESE ARE THE SAME
CANNOT BE IDENTICAL THEREFORE THAT WHICH OF ITS OWN NATURE IS DISTINCT FROM THE HIGHEST GOOD IS NOT ITSELF THE HIGHEST GOOD AN IMPIOUS THOUGHT OF HIM THAN WHOM TIS PLAIN NOTHING CAN BE MORE EXCELLENT
I RECALLED THE HORRIBLE SCHOOL
IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
AND TO EVERY FORM OF SEMI BARBARITY THAT HAS AT ANY TIME EXISTED ON EARTH AND IN SO FAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS JUST BEEN SEMI BARBARITY
BUT THE MEETING AND CONCURRENCE OF THESE CAUSES ARISES FROM THAT INEVITABLE CHAIN OF ORDER WHICH FLOWING FROM THE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF PROVIDENCE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IN THEIR DUE TIME AND PLACE
AS ITS SIXTH SENSE OWING TO THIS MINGLING THE PAST OF EVERY FORM AND MODE OF LIFE AND OF CULTURES WHICH WERE FORMERLY CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS AND SUPERIMPOSED ON ONE ANOTHER FLOWS FORTH INTO US
ESPRIT VASTE AND EVEN VOLTAIRE THE LAST ECHO OF THE CENTURY CANNOT AND COULD NOT SO EASILY APPROPRIATE WHOM THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE VERY DECIDED YEA
WHAT PLACE CAN BE LEFT FOR RANDOM ACTION WHEN GOD CONSTRAINETH ALL THINGS TO ORDER FOR EX NIHILO NIHIL IS SOUND DOCTRINE WHICH NONE OF THE ANCIENTS GAINSAID
CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATOR
HONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVE
LET US BE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BEING CREDITED WITH MORAL TACT AND SUBTLETY IN MORAL DISCERNMENT THEY NEVER FORGIVE US IF THEY HAVE ONCE MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE US
THE DIVINING INSTINCT FOR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THESE VALUATIONS FOR THE RELATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE VALUATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE OPERATING FORCES THIS HISTORICAL SENSE
BUT IS ALSO AN INCENTIVE TO SINS OF OMISSION AN ADDITIONAL SEDUCTION UNDER THE MASK OF PHILANTHROPY AND PRECISELY A SEDUCTION AND INJURY TO THE HIGHER RARER AND MORE PRIVILEGED TYPES OF MEN
WE ENJOY HOMER ONCE MORE IT IS PERHAPS OUR HAPPIEST ACQUISITION THAT WE KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE HOMER WHOM MEN OF DISTINGUISHED CULTURE
OUR VIRTUES IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE TOO HAVE STILL OUR VIRTUES ALTHOUGH NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT THOSE SINCERE AND MASSIVE VIRTUES ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH WE HOLD OUR GRANDFATHERS IN ESTEEM
JUST AS THOUGH IN SHORT THEY BETRAY SOMETHING THEREBY FLAUBERT FOR INSTANCE
AND ALL SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH DEAL ONLY WITH THESE ARE NAIVETES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX
MALICE SPIRITUALISES THEY ARE GLAD IN THEIR INMOST HEART THAT THERE IS A STANDARD ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE OVER ENDOWED WITH INTELLECTUAL GOODS AND PRIVILEGES ARE EQUAL TO THEM
SOON TO DRAW APART AND PLAINWARD EACH ITS SEPARATE WAY TO WEND WHEN ONCE MORE THEIR WATERS MINGLE IN A CHANNEL
BY MEANS OF OUR SEMI BARBARITY IN BODY AND IN DESIRE WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS EVERYWHERE SUCH AS A NOBLE AGE NEVER HAD WE HAVE ACCESS ABOVE ALL TO THE LABYRINTH OF IMPERFECT CIVILIZATIONS
THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME
AS THEY SHINE HERE AND THERE THOSE MOMENTS AND MARVELOUS EXPERIENCES WHEN A GREAT POWER HAS VOLUNTARILY COME TO A HALT BEFORE THE BOUNDLESS AND INFINITE WHEN A SUPER ABUNDANCE OF REFINED DELIGHT HAS BEEN ENJOYED
A DISSATISFACTION WITH ITS OWN CONDITION OR AN ADMIRATION OF WHAT IS STRANGE ALL THIS DETERMINES AND DISPOSES THEM UNFAVOURABLY EVEN TOWARDS THE BEST THINGS OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE NOT THEIR PROPERTY
AT ALL AND IF SO WHAT IT IS THEN SHE MADE ANSWER I AM ANXIOUS TO FULFIL MY PROMISE COMPLETELY AND OPEN TO THEE A WAY OF RETURN TO THY NATIVE LAND
NO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE
EVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWS
HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
I MEAN AFTER COMFORT AND FASHION
IT IS DESIRABLE THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD REFLECT UPON MORALS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT MORALS SHOULD NOT SOME DAY BECOME INTERESTING
CHAPTER SEVEN OUR VIRTUES
AND MAKES HIS DESTRUCTION DESIRABLE THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING OF GREAT SUFFERING KNOW YE NOT THAT IT IS ONLY THIS DISCIPLINE THAT HAS PRODUCED ALL THE ELEVATIONS OF HUMANITY HITHERTO
AT LEAST TO THE VERY BAD TASTE AND WE CAN ONLY EVOKE IN OURSELVES IMPERFECTLY HESITATINGLY AND WITH COMPULSION THE SMALL SHORT AND HAPPY GODSENDS AND GLORIFICATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
TO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLE
THAT I HONOUR AND RESPECT AN UNSELFISH MAN NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS UNSELFISH BUT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE USEFUL TO ANOTHER MAN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE IN SHORT THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS
THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF WHICH ARE ALREADY SPECIFIED DOCUMENTARILY IN A THOUGHTFUL LETTER OF GALIANI TO MADAME D'EPINAY IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF THE MAN OF MODERN IDEAS
GRADATIONS OF RANK IN THE WORLD EVEN AMONG THINGS AND NOT ONLY AMONG MEN
OUR STUPIDITY EVERY VIRTUE INCLINES TO STUPIDITY EVERY STUPIDITY TO VIRTUE STUPID TO THE POINT OF SANCTITY THEY SAY IN RUSSIA LET US BE CAREFUL LEST
EX NIHILO FOR IT HAS ITS PROPER CAUSES THE UNFORESEEN AND UNEXPECTED CONCURRENCE OF WHICH HAS BROUGHT THE CHANCE ABOUT FOR HAD NOT THE CULTIVATOR BEEN DIGGING
THAT IS ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE MODES OF THOUGHT AND NAIVETES WHICH EVERY ONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTIST'S CONSCIENCE
IS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM
WE ARE PREPARED AS NO OTHER AGE HAS EVER BEEN FOR A CARNIVAL IN THE GRAND STYLE FOR THE MOST SPIRITUAL FESTIVAL LAUGHTER AND ARROGANCE FOR THE TRANSCENDENTAL HEIGHT OF SUPREME FOLLY
I SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES
AND ARE SELDOM UNEQUIVOCAL AND THERE ARE OFTEN CASES ALSO IN WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE MOTLEY COLOURED
AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
I WOULD NOW RECOMMEND FOR A CHANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR A PLEASURE NAMELY THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTUTENESS WITH WHICH GOOD FAT HONEST MEDIOCRITY ALWAYS BEHAVES TOWARDS LOFTIER SPIRITS
THE HISTORICAL SENSE IMPLIES ALMOST THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING WHEREBY IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES ITSELF TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE FOR INSTANCE
MORAL SERMONS AND GOODY GOODNESS WON'T CHIME
MORAL SYSTEMS MUST BE COMPELLED FIRST OF ALL TO BOW BEFORE THE GRADATIONS OF RANK THEIR PRESUMPTION MUST BE DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR CONSCIENCE UNTIL THEY THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AT LAST
BUT LET US NOT BE AFRAID THINGS STILL REMAIN TODAY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN I SEE NO ONE IN EUROPE WHO HAS OR DISCLOSES AN IDEA OF THE FACT THAT PHILOSOPHIZING CONCERNING MORALS
THEY WILL SAY THEIR HONESTY' THAT IS THEIR DEVILRY AND NOTHING ELSE WHAT DOES IT MATTER AND EVEN IF THEY WERE RIGHT HAVE NOT ALL GODS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH SANCTIFIED
OUR ITCHING IS REALLY THE ITCHING FOR THE INFINITE THE IMMEASURABLE LIKE THE RIDER ON HIS FORWARD PANTING HORSE WE LET THE REINS FALL BEFORE THE INFINITE WE MODERN MEN WE SEMI BARBARIANS
LET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE
NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
FOR INSTANCE IF A MAN IS DIGGING THE EARTH FOR TILLAGE AND FINDS A MASS OF BURIED GOLD NOW SUCH A FIND IS REGARDED AS ACCIDENTAL YET IT IS NOT
AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS GENERALLY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERN ORDINARY MEN INCLUDING THE CULTURED EVEN THE LEARNED AND PERHAPS PHILOSOPHERS ALSO IF APPEARANCES DO NOT DECEIVE
NOT FROM ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE DISCOVERER SINCE NEITHER HE WHO BURIED THE GOLD NOR HE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD INTENDED THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE FOUND BUT AS I SAID IT HAPPENED
IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILY
THERE WAS MORE EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR OF GREEN GABLES THAN THERE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE IN ALL ITS HISTORY EVEN MARILLA WAS SO EXCITED THAT SHE COULDN'T HELP SHOWING IT WHICH WAS LITTLE SHORT OF BEING PHENOMENAL
OH NO DEAR IT WASN'T DOCTOR CHILTON AT ALL THAT I MEANT IT IS A NEW DOCTOR A VERY FAMOUS DOCTOR FROM NEW YORK WHO WHO KNOWS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ABOUT HURTS LIKE YOURS
WASN'T THERE ANYBODY ELSE DOWN TO BOSTON BUT JUST THAT EVERLASTING JAMIE WHY JIMMY BEAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED POLLYANNA THE BOY LIFTED HIS CHIN A LITTLE
OLD TOM STIFFENED I WAS ONLY THINKIN TWOULD BE SOME OF A SURPRISE TO HER HE EXPLAINED WITH DIGNITY
AND YOU'VE KNOWN ME EVER SINCE REPEATED JIMMY BUT IN A FAR DIFFERENT VOICE JIMMY HAD SUDDENLY COME BACK TO THE PRESENT AND TO HIS GRIEVANCE BUT THEN I AIN'T JAMIE YOU KNOW HE FINISHED WITH SCORNFUL EMPHASIS
I WONDER WHAT HIS FATE WAS WELL IT WAS A FORTUNATE MISTAKE SAID MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE THOUGH MIND YOU THERE WAS A TIME I DIDN'T THINK SO THAT EVENING I CAME UP TO SEE ANNE AND SHE TREATED US TO SUCH A SCENE
AS HE TURNED LOFTILY AWAY LEAVING A DISTRESSED BEWILDERED POLLYANNA BEHIND HIM WELL ANYWAY I CAN BE GLAD HE DOESN'T ALWAYS ACT LIKE THIS SIGHED THE LITTLE GIRL
SURRENDERED AND LAUGHED WITH HIM WELL ANYWAY SHE REITERATED WHEN SHE HAD CAUGHT HER BREATH I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ALL THE SAME NO DEAR I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T AGREED THE MAN
GRINNED OLD TOM THEN ABRUPTLY THE LIGHT DIED FROM HIS EYES HOW IS SHE TER DAY THE LITTLE GAL NANCY SHOOK HER HEAD HER FACE TOO HAD SOBERED JUST THE SAME MISTER TOM
IF IF YOU DON'T MIND VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DOCTOR CHILTON TRULY I WOULD A DISTRESSED COLOR SUFFUSED MISS POLLY'S FACE FOR A MOMENT SHE DID NOT SPEAK AT ALL
THAT HAD TO DEAL WITH BIG FEARSOME SOUNDING WORDS BESIDES IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE WOULD NOT MISTER PENDLETON BE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN MISSUS CAREW'S TAKING THE BOY INTO HER HOME
I CAN'T REALIZE THAT SHE'S GROWN UP I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT I FELT WHEN I SAW MATTHEW BRINGING IN A GIRL
HER MARRIAGE HAD BEEN HAPPY WEALTH HAD NOT SPOILED HER SHE WAS STILL THE PLACID AMIABLE PINK CHEEKED JANE OF THE OLD QUARTETTE SYMPATHISING WITH HER OLD CHUM'S HAPPINESS AND AS KEENLY INTERESTED IN ALL THE DAINTY DETAILS OF ANNE'S TROUSSEAU
IT WAS SURELY THEIR DUTY TO PUT THE MATTER BEFORE HER IN ANOTHER LIGHT YET THESE TWO WORTHY LADIES WERE NOT ENEMIES OF ANNE ON THE CONTRARY THEY WERE REALLY QUITE FOND OF HER
SHE WA'N'T THERE AND ALWAYS EVERYWHERE SHE WENT POLLYANNA MET THE QUESTION WELL HOW DID YOU LIKE BOSTON PERHAPS TO NO ONE DID SHE ANSWER THIS MORE FULLY THAN SHE DID TO MISTER PENDLETON
DOCTOR CHILTON OH AUNT POLLY I'D SO LOVE TO HAVE DOCTOR CHILTON I'VE WANTED HIM ALL THE TIME BUT I WAS AFRAID YOU DIDN'T ON ACCOUNT OF HIS SEEING YOU IN THE SUN PARLOR THAT DAY YOU KNOW SO I DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING BUT
WELL SHE DIDN'T TELL MISS POLLY REJOINED NANCY MISS POLLYANNA TOLD ME LONG AGO THAT SHE COULDN'T TELL HER CAUSE HER AUNT DIDN'T LIKE TER HAVE HER TALK ABOUT HER FATHER AN TWAS HER FATHER'S GAME
IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT JIMMY SAID MUCH OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PAST LIFE OF HIS BEFORE SHE HAD KNOWN HIM AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SHE PROMPTED POLLYANNA HAD FOR THE MOMENT FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT OF THE CONTROVERSY
I'M NOT JIMMY BEAN I'M JIMMY PENDLETON AND I MEAN THAT I SHOULD THINK FROM YOUR TALK THAT THERE WASN'T ANYBODY DOWN TO BOSTON BUT JUST THAT LOONY BOY WHO CALLS THEM BIRDS AND SQUIRRELS LADY LANCELOT
THAT SHE WOULD DO ANYTHING ANYTHING BUT THAT TO PLEASE HER DEAR POLLYANNA AS THE DAYS OF WAITING PASSED ONE BY ONE IT DID INDEED SEEM THAT AUNT POLLY WAS DOING EVERYTHING BUT THAT
ON MOST OCCASIONS SHE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THE INTEREST SHOWN BUT ONE DAY SHE MET WITH A SURPRISE IT CAME THROUGH JIMMY PENDLETON SAY LOOK A HERE HE DEMANDED ONE AFTERNOON IRRITABLY
GROWING MORE AND MORE JEALOUS MOMENT BY MOMENT STILL DOGGEDLY HE HELD HIS GROUND WELL ANYHOW HE SCOFFED I DON'T THINK MUCH OF HIS NAME JAMIE HUMPH SOUNDS SISSY
AND HIS WIFE HAD A BABY HERE BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WEDDING BEFORE IT DOES SEEM SO STRANGE TO THINK OF ANNE BEING MARRIED IN A WAY SHE JUST SEEMS TO ME THE LITTLE GIRL MATTHEW BROUGHT HOME HERE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO
THAT WOULD BE EXPECTING TOO MUCH BUT THERE IS A BROOK AND IT ACTUALLY CUTS ACROSS ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN THEN SAID ANNE WITH A LONG SIGH OF SUPREME SATISFACTION
JANE WAS NOT BRILLIANT AND HAD PROBABLY NEVER MADE A REMARK WORTH LISTENING TO IN HER LIFE BUT SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING THAT WOULD HURT ANYONE'S FEELINGS WHICH MAY BE A NEGATIVE TALENT BUT IS LIKEWISE A RARE AND ENVIABLE ONE
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED FOLKS COMMENTED THE MAN I DO POLLYANNA FROWNED AGAIN AND PONDERED BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF SUCH A LOT OF THEM IF YOU DON'T KNOW EM AND MISSUS CAREW WOULDN'T LET ME
THERE IS A BIG GROVE OF FIR TREES BEHIND IT TWO ROWS OF LOMBARDY POPLARS DOWN THE LANE AND A RING OF WHITE BIRCHES AROUND A VERY DELIGHTFUL GARDEN OUR FRONT DOOR OPENS RIGHT INTO THE GARDEN
THE HINGES ARE ON ONE TRUNK AND THE CATCH ON THE OTHER THEIR BOUGHS FORM AN ARCH OVERHEAD OH I'M SO GLAD I COULDN'T LIVE WHERE THERE WERE NO TREES SOMETHING VITAL IN ME WOULD STARVE
I NEVER SUPPOSED SHE'D WANT THEM THEY'RE SO OLD FASHIONED AND NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT ANYTHING BUT HOOKED MATS NOW BUT SHE ASKED ME FOR THEM SAID SHE'D RATHER HAVE THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR HER FLOORS THEY ARE PRETTY
SO GILBERT DIDN'T GO BACK ON YOU AFTER ALL SAID MISSUS HARMON ANDREWS CONTRIVING TO CONVEY AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE IN HER TONE
WELL I GUESS YE WON'T THEN FROM ME OH MISTER TOM COME ON NOW WHEEDLED THE GIRL YE SEE THERE AIN'T MANY FOLKS HERE THAT I CAN ASK MAYBE NOT BUT THERE'S ONE ANYHOW THAT AIN'T ANSWERIN
THIS TIME BELDINGSVILLE DID NOT LITERALLY WELCOME POLLYANNA HOME WITH BRASS BANDS AND BUNTING PERHAPS BECAUSE THE HOUR OF HER EXPECTED ARRIVAL WAS KNOWN TO BUT FEW OF THE TOWNSPEOPLE
BUT HER EYES WERE TROUBLED THE DOCTOR WAS OPENLY NERVOUS AND IMPATIENT MISS POLLY SAID LITTLE BUT EVEN THE SOFTENING WAVES OF HAIR ABOUT HER FACE AND THE BECOMING LACES AT HER THROAT COULD NOT HIDE THE FACT
TWO OF THAT ILK DESCENDED UPON ANNE ONE VIOLET DUSK AND PROCEEDED TO DO WHAT IN THEM LAY TO PRICK THE RAINBOW BUBBLE OF HER SATISFACTION IF SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GETTING ANY PARTICULAR PRIZE IN YOUNG DOCTOR BLYTHE
I'M SO GLAD YOU DO WANT HIM AUNT POLLY'S FACE HAD TURNED WHITE THEN RED THEN BACK TO WHITE AGAIN BUT WHEN SHE ANSWERED SHE SHOWED VERY PLAINLY THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO SPEAK LIGHTLY AND CHEERFULLY
YES TWAS ALL ROUND ALL ROUND SIGHED NANCY IN HER TURN AS SHE WENT BACK TO HER KITCHEN FOR NO ONE WERE THOSE DAYS OF WAITING EASY THE NURSE TRIED TO LOOK CHEERFUL
I COULDN'T GUESS I WOULDN'T THINK SHE COULD FIND ANYTHIN ABOUT THAT TER BE GLAD ABOUT SHE DID SHE SAID I COULD BE GLAD ANYHOW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TER STOOP SO FAR TER DO MY WEEDIN
LIKE EATING DINNER AT NIGHT INSTEAD OF NOONS WHEN YOU OUGHT TO EAT IT BUT EVERYBODY WAS SO GOOD TO ME AND I SAW SUCH A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS BUNKER HILL AND THE PUBLIC GARDEN AND THE SEEING BOSTON AUTOS
GLEN SAINT MARY FOLKS PREFER PLUSH BROCADE AND SIDEBOARDS WITH MIRRORS AND ORNAMENTATIONS I FANCY BUT MISS RUSSELL'S FURNITURE IS VERY GOOD AND I FEEL SURE YOU'LL LIKE IT ANNE SO FAR GOOD SAID ANNE
SHE LOOKS LIKE FOLKS NOW SHE'S ACTUALLY ALMOST KEERFUL NOW NANCY INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN WITH A SLOW GRIN
I HOPE YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY YOU HAVE MY BEST WISHES I'M SURE A LONG ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T OFTEN TURN OUT WELL BUT OF COURSE IN YOUR CASE IT COULDN'T BE HELPED
IN STARTING ON A ROUND OF FLY AWAY MINUTE CALLS ON ALL HER OLD FRIENDS INDEED FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS ACCORDING TO NANCY THERE WASN'T NO PUTTING OF YOUR FINGER ON HER ANYWHERES
THAT SHE COULD DO TO PLEASE HER NIECE I WOULDN'T A BELIEVED IT YOU COULDN'T A MADE ME BELIEVE IT NANCY SAID TO OLD TOM ONE MORNING
SHE SELLS BOWS LOVELY BOWS IN A BIG STORE SHE WANTS TO KNOW PEOPLE AND I INTRODUCED HER TO MISSUS CAREW AND WE HAD HER UP TO THE HOUSE AND WE HAD JAMIE AND LOTS OF OTHERS THERE TOO AND SHE WAS SO GLAD TO KNOW THEM
AN MISS POLLYANNA LOOKIN ON AN BOSSIN FROM THE BED
GILBERT LOOKS VERY YOUNG FOR A DOCTOR I'M AFRAID PEOPLE WON'T HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM SAID MISSUS JASPER BELL GLOOMILY THEN SHE SHUT HER MOUTH TIGHTLY AS IF SHE HAD SAID WHAT SHE CONSIDERED IT HER DUTY TO SAY AND HELD HER CONSCIENCE CLEAR
AND ONE DAY FATHER HEARD HER HE GOT AWFUL MAD SO MAD THAT I REMEMBERED IT ALWAYS WHAT HE SAID HE SAID JAMIE WASN'T NO SORT OF A NAME FOR A BOY
OH YES SHE TOLD ME LONG AGO THE OLD MAN HESITATED THEN WENT ON HIS LIPS TWITCHING A LITTLE I WAS GROWLIN ONE DAY CAUSE I WAS SO BENT UP AND CROOKED AN WHAT DO YE S'POSE THE LITTLE THING SAID
BUT WHEN WE GET A PHONE IN THAT WON'T MATTER SO MUCH THE SITUATION IS BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKS TO THE SUNSET AND HAS THE GREAT BLUE HARBOR BEFORE IT THE SAND DUNES AREN'T VERY FAR AWAY THE SEA WINDS BLOW OVER THEM AND THE SEA SPRAY DRENCHES THEM
THAT SHE WAS GROWING THIN AND PALE AS TO POLLYANNA POLLYANNA PETTED THE DOG SMOOTHED THE CAT'S SLEEK HEAD ADMIRED THE FLOWERS AND ATE THE FRUITS AND JELLIES THAT WERE SENT IN TO HER
CAUSE I WAS ALREADY BENT PART WAY OVER NANCY GAVE A WISTFUL LAUGH WELL I AIN'T SURPRISED AFTER ALL YOU MIGHT KNOW SHE'D FIND SOMETHIN WE'VE BEEN PLAYIN IT THAT GAME SINCE ALMOST THE FIRST
HER CHEEKS WERE VERY RED TOO I SAY IF YOU LOVED DOCTOR CHILTON AND DIDN'T LOVE THE OTHER ONE SIGHED POLLYANNA SEEMS TO ME THAT WOULD MAKE SOME DIFFERENCE IN THE GOOD HE WOULD DO AND I LOVE DOCTOR CHILTON
NANCY SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS OH SHE AIN'T HANDSOME OF COURSE BUT I WILL OWN UP SHE DON'T LOOK LIKE THE SAME WOMAN WHAT WITH THE RIBBONS AN LACE JIGGERS MISS POLLYANNA MAKES HER WEAR ROUND HER NECK
I'D BELIEVE ANYTHIN O THE MISTRESS NOW EVEN THAT SHE'D TAKE TER PLAYIN IT HERSELF BUT HAIN'T THE LITTLE GAL TOLD HER EVER SHE'S TOLD EV'RY ONE ELSE I GUESS I'M HEARIN OF IT EV'RYWHERE NOW SINCE SHE WAS HURTED SAID TOM
MARILLA FELT THAT IN SOME STRANGE WAY HIS MARRIAGE WITH ANNE WOULD PUT RIGHT THAT OLD MISTAKE GOOD HAD COME OUT OF THE EVIL OF THE ANCIENT BITTERNESS AS FOR ANNE HERSELF SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE ALMOST FELT FRIGHTENED
AND MEANT TO MAKE HER APOLOGY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE CATHERINE'S MIND WAS GREATLY EASED BY THIS INFORMATION YET A SOMETHING OF SOLICITUDE REMAINED FROM WHICH SPRANG THE FOLLOWING QUESTION THOROUGHLY ARTLESS IN ITSELF THOUGH RATHER DISTRESSING TO THE GENTLEMAN BUT MISTER TILNEY
AND PERHAPS HE MIGHT BE NOW COMING ROUND TO THEIR BOX SHE WAS RIGHT IN A FEW MINUTES HE APPEARED
AND HE BEING HURRIED FOR TIME AND NOT CARING TO HAVE IT PUT OFF MADE A POINT OF HER BEING DENIED THAT WAS ALL I DO ASSURE YOU
BUT INDEED I DID NOT WISH YOU A PLEASANT WALK I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING BUT I BEGGED MISTER THORPE SO EARNESTLY TO STOP I CALLED OUT TO HIM AS SOON AS EVER I SAW YOU NOW MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT OH YOU WERE NOT THERE BUT INDEED I DID AND IF MISTER THORPE WOULD ONLY HAVE STOPPED
TRIPPING LIGHTLY THROUGH THE CHURCH YARD AND RESOLUTELY TURNING AWAY HER EYES THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO SEE HER BELOVED ISABELLA AND HER DEAR FAMILY WHO SHE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE WERE IN A SHOP HARD BY SHE REACHED THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT LOOKED AT THE NUMBER
TO THE THEATRE ACCORDINGLY THEY ALL WENT NO TILNEYS APPEARED TO PLAGUE OR PLEASE HER SHE FEARED THAT AMONGST THE MANY PERFECTIONS OF THE FAMILY A FONDNESS FOR PLAYS WAS NOT TO BE RANKED BUT PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE HABITUATED TO THE FINER PERFORMANCES OF THE LONDON STAGE
HE JOINED HER AND MARIANNE IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE OTHERS WERE DOWN AND MARIANNE WHO WAS ALWAYS EAGER TO PROMOTE THEIR HAPPINESS AS FAR AS SHE COULD SOON LEFT THEM TO THEMSELVES BUT BEFORE SHE WAS HALF WAY UPSTAIRS SHE HEARD THE PARLOUR DOOR OPEN
AND BEING INTOLERABLY CONCEITED ABOUT IT UNTIL SARA RAY CURED HIM BY CALLING HIM A DEAR SWEET CAT AND KISSING HIM BETWEEN THE EARS THEN PAT SNEAKED ABJECTLY OFF HIS TAIL DROOPING
I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THE STORY GIRL HONESTLY I THOUGHT IT WAS A BELL WHEN I HEARD IT AND THE DOOR OPEN TOO LET US BE FAIR FELICITY
WHAT COULD THEY HAVE TO SAY OF HER SHE FEARED GENERAL TILNEY DID NOT LIKE HER APPEARANCE SHE FOUND IT WAS IMPLIED IN HIS PREVENTING HER ADMITTANCE TO HIS DAUGHTER RATHER THAN POSTPONE HIS OWN WALK A FEW MINUTES HOW CAME MISTER THORPE TO KNOW YOUR FATHER WAS HER ANXIOUS INQUIRY
THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE SHADE OF HER OWN EDWARD'S EMBARRASSMENT LASTED SOME TIME AND IT ENDED IN AN ABSENCE OF MIND STILL MORE SETTLED HE WAS PARTICULARLY GRAVE THE WHOLE MORNING MARIANNE SEVERELY CENSURED HERSELF FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID
PAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN MORE THAN ANY HUMAN BEING EVER KNEW AND I VOW PADDY WOULD LICK HIS CHOPS WITH DELIGHT BUT TO BE CALLED A SWEET CAT OH SARA SARA
FRIDAY WAS A COMFORTABLE DAY IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF KING EVERYBODY WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR THE STORY GIRL SPARKLED THROUGH SEVERAL TALES THAT RANGED FROM THE AFRITES AND JINNS OF EASTERN MYTH THROUGH THE PIPING DAYS OF CHIVALRY DOWN TO THE HOMELY ANECDOTES OF CARLISLE WORKADAY FOLKS
WELL HERE'S THE KEY GO AND SEE FOR YOURSELF SAID PETER FELICITY HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING AND SEEING I THINK YOU BOYS OUGHT TO GO SHE SAID RETREATING BEHIND THE DEFENCE OF SEX YOU OUGHT TO BE BRAVER THAN GIRLS
WE RAN TO THE ORCHARD GATE AND SWARMED ACROSS THE YARD JUST AS UNCLE ROGER ALIGHTED AT THE FRONT DOOR HE STARED AT US IN THE MOONLIGHT
BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEM IN BUT WHAT WAS WORN AND HACKNEYED OUT OF ALL SENSE AND MEANING I AM CONVINCED SAID EDWARD THAT YOU REALLY FEEL ALL THE DELIGHT IN A FINE PROSPECT WHICH YOU PROFESS TO FEEL
ONE BITTER DAY WHEN THEY SEEK IT
I HAVE AN IDEA THAT A RASPBERRY PIE FOR TO MORROW NIGHT WHEN THE FOLKS COME HOME WOULD HIT THE RIGHT SPOT ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA WE ALL SET OFF ARMED WITH JUGS AND CUPS FELICITY THOUGHTFUL CREATURE ALSO TOOK A SMALL BASKETFUL OF JELLY COOKIES ALONG WITH HER
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STREET HOWEVER SHE LOOKED BACK AGAIN AND THEN NOT AT A WINDOW BUT ISSUING FROM THE DOOR SHE SAW MISS TILNEY HERSELF SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY A GENTLEMAN WHOM CATHERINE BELIEVED TO BE HER FATHER AND THEY TURNED UP TOWARDS EDGAR'S BUILDINGS
I THINK THERE IS SUCH A PLACE IN SPITE OF UNCLE EDWARD SAID THE STORY GIRL DREAMILY AND I THINK THERE IS A WAY OF GETTING THERE TOO IF WE COULD ONLY FIND IT
MISSUS ALLEN SAID CATHERINE THE NEXT MORNING WILL THERE BE ANY HARM IN MY CALLING ON MISS TILNEY TODAY I SHALL NOT BE EASY TILL I HAVE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING GO BY ALL MEANS MY DEAR ONLY PUT ON A WHITE GOWN MISS TILNEY ALWAYS WEARS WHITE
AND WHO IS WILLOUGHBY SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE TO MISS DASHWOOD BY WHOM HE WAS SITTING SHE GAVE HIM A BRIEF REPLY
A PRETTY WALK THROUGH A WORLD OF GREEN WHISPERING BOUGHS AND SPICE SWEET FERNS AND SHIFTING PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT THE RASPBERRIES WERE PLENTIFUL
AND DEPENDENCE ON CATHERINE'S HONOUR OH DO NOT SAY MISS TILNEY WAS NOT ANGRY CRIED CATHERINE BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WAS FOR SHE WOULD NOT SEE ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CALLED I SAW HER WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE THE NEXT MINUTE AFTER MY LEAVING IT I WAS HURT BUT I WAS NOT AFFRONTED
TILL A NEW OBJECT SUDDENLY ENGAGED HER ATTENTION SHE WAS SITTING BY EDWARD AND IN TAKING HIS TEA FROM MISSUS DASHWOOD HIS HAND PASSED SO DIRECTLY BEFORE HER AS TO MAKE A RING WITH A PLAIT OF HAIR IN THE CENTRE VERY CONSPICUOUS ON ONE OF HIS FINGERS
HE STRUGGLED OUT OF MY CLASP AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE LONG GRASSES WITH SOUNDLESS LEAPS
PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW I HAD BEEN THERE I WAS NOT WITHIN AT THE TIME BUT I HEARD OF IT FROM ELEANOR AND SHE HAS BEEN WISHING EVER SINCE TO SEE YOU TO EXPLAIN THE REASON OF SUCH INCIVILITY BUT PERHAPS I CAN DO IT AS WELL IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT MY FATHER
AND THAT IS THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE ON THAT DAY THE GATES OF EDEN ARE SHUT BEHIND THEM AND THE AGE OF GOLD IS OVER HENCEFORTH THEY MUST DWELL IN THE COMMON LIGHT OF COMMON DAY ONLY A FEW WHO REMAIN CHILDREN AT HEART CAN EVER FIND THAT FAIR LOST PATH AGAIN
EDWARD SAW ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND NOT ONLY THE MEANING OF OTHERS BUT SUCH OF MARIANNE'S EXPRESSIONS AS HAD PUZZLED HIM BEFORE AND WHEN THEIR VISITORS LEFT THEM HE WENT IMMEDIATELY ROUND HER AND SAID IN A WHISPER I HAVE BEEN GUESSING SHALL I TELL YOU MY GUESS
CATHERINE CHEERFULLY COMPLIED AND BEING PROPERLY EQUIPPED WAS MORE IMPATIENT THAN EVER TO BE AT THE PUMP ROOM THAT SHE MIGHT INFORM HERSELF OF GENERAL TILNEY'S LODGINGS FOR THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE HOUSE
I SHALL TELL IT TOO I DON'T CARE IF THE JOKE IS AS MUCH ON MYSELF AS ANY ONE A STORY IS A STORY NO MATTER WHO IT'S ON BUT IT IS HATEFUL TO BE LAUGHED AT AND GROWN UPS ALWAYS DO IT I NEVER WILL WHEN I'M GROWN UP I'LL REMEMBER BETTER
CHANCING ACCIDENTALLY I VOW TO OVERHEAR CERTAIN OF THESE SECRETS I LEARNED THAT SARA RAY HAD NAMED AN APPLE FOR JOHNNY PRICE AND CECILY TRUE'S YOU LIVE THERE WAS EIGHT SEEDS IN IT AND YOU KNOW EIGHT MEANS THEY BOTH LOVE
IF I PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER IT WILL BE TOO LATE I'M GROWING SO FAST AUNT OLIVIA SAYS I'LL HAVE TO WEAR ANKLE SKIRTS NEXT SUMMER IF I BEGIN TO LOOK GROWN UP HE'LL GET FRIGHTENED OF ME AND THEN I'LL NEVER FIND OUT THE GOLDEN MILESTONE MYSTERY
THAT THE NAME OF FERRARS BEGAN WITH AN F AND THIS PREPARED A FUTURE MINE OF RAILLERY AGAINST THE DEVOTED ELINOR WHICH NOTHING BUT THE NEWNESS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH EDWARD COULD HAVE PREVENTED FROM BEING IMMEDIATELY SPRUNG
ALL AT ONCE SOMETHING LEAPED FROM THE BOUGH OF A TREE AND ALIGHTED BEFORE US WE SPLIT THE AIR WITH A SIMULTANEOUS SHRIEK
SHE WAS UPON THE WHOLE LEFT ONE OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD WHILE TALKING TO EACH OTHER
TO WHAT A DEGREE OF UNFORGIVINGNESS IT MIGHT WITH PROPRIETY LEAD NOR TO WHAT RIGOURS OF RUDENESS IN RETURN IT MIGHT JUSTLY MAKE HER AMENABLE DEJECTED AND HUMBLED SHE HAD EVEN SOME THOUGHTS OF NOT GOING WITH THE OTHERS TO THE THEATRE THAT NIGHT
AND NOW IT HAS ALMOST FRIGHTENED YOU POOR LITTLE MONKEYS TO DEATH WE HEARD UNCLE ROGER CHUCKLING ALL THE WAY TO THE BARN
AND HE REPLIED IN A TONE WHICH RETAINED ONLY A LITTLE AFFECTED RESERVE WE WERE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU AT ANY RATE FOR WISHING US A PLEASANT WALK AFTER OUR PASSING YOU IN ARGYLE STREET YOU WERE SO KIND AS TO LOOK BACK ON PURPOSE
VERY FEW CATS HAVE AND MOST OF THEM HAVE SUCH AN INORDINATE APPETITE FOR FLATTERY THAT THEY WILL SWALLOW ANY AMOUNT OF IT AND THRIVE THEREON PADDY HAD A FINER TASTE THE STORY GIRL AND I WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD PAY HIM COMPLIMENTS TO HIS LIKING
KING'S GHOST WHISPERED FELIX SHE NEVER APPEARED ANYWHERE BUT IN THE ORCHARD SAID THE STORY GIRL OH OH CHILDREN ISN'T THERE SOMETHING UNDER UNCLE ALEC'S TREE WE PEERED FEARFULLY THROUGH THE GLOOM THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT WAVERED AND FLUTTERED ADVANCED RETREATED
THERE WE STOOD IN A HUDDLED DEMORALIZED GROUP OH WHAT AN EERIE PLACE THAT ORCHARD WAS WHAT SHADOWS WHAT NOISES
THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF COMFORT IN THIS WE WERE ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF PEG BOWEN AS WE WOULD BE OF ANY SPECTRAL VISITANT PETER SCOFFED AT THE IDEA PEG BOWEN WASN'T IN THE HOUSE BEFORE YOUR UNCLE ROGER LOCKED IT UP AND HOW COULD SHE GET IN AFTERWARDS HE SAID
CATHERINE IN DEEP MORTIFICATION PROCEEDED ON HER WAY SHE COULD ALMOST BE ANGRY HERSELF AT SUCH ANGRY INCIVILITY BUT SHE CHECKED THE RESENTFUL SENSATION SHE REMEMBERED HER OWN IGNORANCE SHE KNEW NOT HOW SUCH AN OFFENCE AS HERS MIGHT BE CLASSED BY THE LAWS OF WORLDLY POLITENESS
IT DON'T SOUND A BIT LIKE OTHER CLOCKS
THE POOR MAN MEANT IT AS A COMPLIMENT BUT FELICITY WHO KNEW UNCLE BLAIR WAS AN ARTIST AND HAD A POOR OPINION OF SUCH FRY LOOKED INDIGNANT AND RETORTED INDEED SHE WASN'T
I DO NOT LIKE RUINED TATTERED COTTAGES I AM NOT FOND OF NETTLES OR THISTLES OR HEATH BLOSSOMS I HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN A SNUG FARM HOUSE THAN A WATCH TOWER
AND FORCED HIM TO HEAR HER EXPLANATION FEELINGS RATHER NATURAL THAN HEROIC POSSESSED HER INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING HER OWN DIGNITY INJURED BY THIS READY CONDEMNATION INSTEAD OF PROUDLY RESOLVING IN CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE
WHEN EDWARD INTERRUPTED HER BY SAYING YOU MUST NOT ENQUIRE TOO FAR MARIANNE REMEMBER I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE IN THE PICTURESQUE AND I SHALL OFFEND YOU BY MY IGNORANCE AND WANT OF TASTE IF WE COME TO PARTICULARS
ON THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH HOWEVER THE SUDDEN VIEW OF MISTER HENRY TILNEY AND HIS FATHER JOINING A PARTY IN THE OPPOSITE BOX RECALLED HER TO ANXIETY AND DISTRESS THE STAGE COULD NO LONGER EXCITE GENUINE MERRIMENT NO LONGER KEEP HER WHOLE ATTENTION
NAY I AM SURE BY YOUR LOOK WHEN YOU CAME INTO THE BOX YOU WERE ANGRY I ANGRY I COULD HAVE NO RIGHT WELL NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU HAD NO RIGHT WHO SAW YOUR FACE HE REPLIED BY ASKING HER TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIM AND TALKING OF THE PLAY HE REMAINED WITH THEM SOME TIME
TO SHOW HER RESENTMENT TOWARDS HIM WHO COULD HARBOUR A DOUBT OF IT TO LEAVE TO HIM ALL THE TROUBLE OF SEEKING AN EXPLANATION AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIM ON THE PAST ONLY BY AVOIDING HIS SIGHT OR FLIRTING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE SHAME OF MISCONDUCT
WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL UNCLE ROGER STOPPED LAUGHING BEFORE WE HEARD THE EXPLANATION WE THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD STOP
UNCLE ROGER UNLOCKED AND FLUNG OPEN THE FRONT DOOR AS HE DID SO CLEAR AND SWEET RANG OUT TEN BELL LIKE CHIMES
OR AT LEAST OF ITS APPEARANCE AND WAS ONLY EAGER FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING ITS CAUSE THE PLAY CONCLUDED THE CURTAIN FELL HENRY TILNEY WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN WHERE HE HAD HITHERTO SAT BUT HIS FATHER REMAINED
BUT IT WAS OVER TWO HOURS SINCE WE HAD EATEN THE COOKIES AND FELICITY SUGGESTED THAT A SAUCERFUL APIECE
I CAN EASILY BELIEVE IT TO BE FULL OF ROCKS AND PROMONTORIES GREY MOSS AND BRUSH WOOD BUT THESE ARE ALL LOST ON ME I KNOW NOTHING OF THE PICTURESQUE
FOR SHE SOON RECOLLECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY EXCUSE FOR STAYING AT HOME AND IN THE SECOND
HE STRODE ALONG RIGHT MASTERFULLY AND LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO WAS MONARCH OF ALL HE SURVEYED THE STORY GIRL KISSED HER FINGERTIPS TO HIM WITH THE DELIGHTFUL AUDACITY WHICH WAS A PART OF HER
I WOULD HAVE JUMPED OUT AND RUN AFTER YOU IS THERE A HENRY IN THE WORLD WHO COULD BE INSENSIBLE TO SUCH A DECLARATION HENRY TILNEY AT LEAST WAS NOT WITH A YET SWEETER SMILE HE SAID EVERYTHING THAT NEED BE SAID OF HIS SISTER'S CONCERN REGRET
THAT THE HAIR WAS HER OWN SHE INSTANTANEOUSLY FELT AS WELL SATISFIED AS MARIANNE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT WHAT MARIANNE CONSIDERED AS A FREE GIFT FROM HER SISTER ELINOR WAS CONSCIOUS MUST HAVE BEEN PROCURED BY SOME THEFT OR CONTRIVANCE UNKNOWN TO HERSELF
YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT ME SO RUDE BUT INDEED IT WAS NOT MY OWN FAULT WAS IT MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT THEY TELL ME THAT MISTER TILNEY AND HIS SISTER WERE GONE OUT IN A PHAETON TOGETHER AND THEN WHAT COULD I DO BUT I HAD TEN THOUSAND TIMES RATHER HAVE BEEN WITH YOU
ASK HIM IF HE EVER TASTED DUCK THAT COULD FOR A MOMENT BE COMPARED TO THE BLACK DUCKS IN THE RICE MARSH ALONG THE OSSAWIPPI AND AS FOR FISH AND FISHING
COULD NOT BE IMPROVISED IN THIS HURRIED THOUGH DISASTROUSLY SLOW PREPARATION FOR A WAR THE SHIP IN WHICH WOLFE WAS TO SAIL HAD BEEN LYING IDLE FOR YEARS AND HER PESTILENTIAL BILGE WATER SOON BEGAN TO MAKE THE SAILORS AND SOLDIERS SICKEN AND DIE
BUT SINCE SUCH TREATMENT GIVES A TOTALLY FALSE IDEA OF HIS ACHIEVEMENT THIS LITTLE SKETCH DRAWN STRAIGHT FROM ORIGINAL SOURCES TRIES TO SHOW HIM AS HE REALLY WAS A CO WORKER WITH THE BRITISH FLEET IN A WAR BASED ENTIRELY ON NAVAL STRATEGY
BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT WHEN THE CITY IS WELL BEHIND YOU BIT BY BIT THE TRAIN CHANGES ITS CHARACTER THE ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE THAT TOOK YOU THROUGH THE CITY TUNNELS IS OFF NOW
WHERE HE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AT SWINDEN'S HERE HE WORKED QUIETLY ENOUGH TILL JUST BEFORE HE ENTERED ON HIS TEENS THEN THE LONG PENT RAGE OF ENGLAND SUDDENLY BURST IN WAR WITH SPAIN THE PEOPLE WENT WILD WHEN THE BRITISH FLEET TOOK PORTO BELLO
AND THAT NOT ONLY MEN BUT NATIONS WOULD PLAY THEIR PART IN THE BREAKING OF IT HE SAW THE RED GLEAM OF FIRELIGHT IN OLAF'S EYES AND IF WE DON'T GO IN FIRST FROM THIS SIDE ALAN
AMONG HIS ANGLO IRISH KINSMEN WERE THE GOLDSMITHS AND THE SEYMOURS OLIVER GOLDSMITH HIMSELF
THE LANKY RED HAIRED BOY OF THIRTEEN AND A HALF TOOK HIS SEAT ON THE PORTSMOUTH COACH BESIDE HIS FATHER THE VETERAN SOLDIER OF FIFTY FIVE HIS MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF MUCH TOO FINE A SPIRIT TO GRUDGE ANYTHING FOR THE SERVICE OF HER COUNTRY
DON'T TELL ME THAT THE SPEED IS ONLY TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SALMON SHOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO US IF THE BARS ARE LET DOWN ALL AT ONCE TO THE FINANCIAL BANDITTI UNDERSTANDING AND COMMON SENSE MUST GUARD THE GATES
THE YELLOW FELLOWS WILL COME OUT SOME DAY FROM THAT RUMBLED THE OLD SOUR DOUGH STRIKING HIS PIPE IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND AND WHEN THEY DO THEY WON'T COME OVER TO US IN ONES AN TWOS AN THREES BUT IN MILLIONS THAT'S WHAT THE YELLOW FELLOWS WILL DO
AND AFTER THAT FOR AN HOUR OR MORE SOMETHING LIVED FOR HIM IN THE GLOW OF THE FIRE WHICH OLAF KEPT BURNING IT WAS THE MEMORY OF MARY STANDISH HER QUIET BEAUTIFUL EYES GAZING AT HIM HER PALE FACE
WOLFE'S MOTHER TO WHOM HE OWED A GREAT DEAL OF HIS GENIUS WAS A DESCENDANT OF TWO GOOD FAMILIES IN YORKSHIRE SHE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIS FATHER AND WAS VERY TALL AND HANDSOME WOLFE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO ONE LIKE HER
OLAF FELT RESTING UPON HIM SOMETHING OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A DOCTOR AND AFTER SUPPER HE SAT WITH HIS BACK TO A TREE AND TALKED OF THE OLD DAYS AS IF THEY WERE YESTERDAY AND THE DAY BEFORE
AND THAT THERE ISN'T ONE OF THEM THAT DOESN'T SOMETIMES DREAM IN THE DULL QUIET OF THE LONG EVENING HERE IN THE CLUB THAT SOME DAY HE WILL GO BACK AND SEE THE PLACE THEY ALL DO ONLY THEY'RE HALF ASHAMED TO OWN IT
PAPA AND I ARE JUST GOING ON BOARD BUT I BELIEVE SHALL NOT SAIL THIS FORTNIGHT IN WHICH TIME IF I CAN GET ASHORE AT PORTSMOUTH OR ANY OTHER TOWN I WILL CERTAINLY WRITE TO YOU AND WHEN WE ARE GONE BY EVERY SHIP WE MEET BECAUSE I KNOW IT IS MY DUTY
WHEN HE WAS A COLONEL AND HAD BEEN THROUGH THE WARS AND AT COURT HE STILL BELIEVED SHE WAS A MATCH FOR ALL THE BEAUTIES HE WAS NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO TAKE AFTER HER IN LOOKS EXCEPT IN HER ONE WEAK FEATURE A CUTAWAY CHIN HIS BODY INDEED
SHIPS WERE FITTING OUT IN ENGLISH HARBOURS SOLDIERS WERE MARCHING INTO EVERY ENGLISH CAMP CROWDS WERE SINGING AND CHEERING FIRST ONE BOY'S FATHER AND THEN ANOTHER'S WAS UNDER ORDERS FOR THE FRONT AMONG THEM WAS WOLFE'S FATHER
IT'S GOD'S OWN COUNTRY WE HAVE NORTH OF FIFTY EIGHT OLAF AND WE HAVE TEN TIMES THE WEALTH OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN CARE FOR A MILLION PEOPLE EASILY BUT BAD POLITICS AND BAD JUDGMENT BOTH HERE IN ALASKA AND AT WASHINGTON
INSIDE WAS A COMMISSION AS SECOND LIEUTENANT IN THE MARINES
MANY OF HIS ANCESTORS HAD STOOD READY TO FIGHT FOR KING AND COUNTRY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE HIS FATHER FOUGHT UNDER THE GREAT DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH IN THE WAR AGAINST FRANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HIS GRANDFATHER HIS GREAT GRANDFATHER HIS ONLY UNCLE
AND THAT MARY STANDISH WOULD ALWAYS LIVE IN HIS THOUGHTS NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED IN THE YEARS TO COME BUT HE WAS NOT THE SORT TO LET ANY PART OF HIMSELF WITHER UP AND DIE BECAUSE OF A BLOW THAT HAD DARKENED HIS MENTAL VISIONS OF THINGS HIS PLANS LAY AHEAD OF HIM
I SUPPOSE VERY PROBABLY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ONE OF THESE WOOD ENGINES SINCE YOU WERE A BOY FORTY YEARS AGO THE OLD ENGINE WITH A WIDE TOP LIKE A HAT ON ITS FUNNEL AND WITH SPARKS ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP A SUIT FOR DAMAGES ONCE IN EVERY MILE
WON'T LET THEM COME WITH COAL ENOUGH UNDER OUR FEET TO LAST A THOUSAND YEARS WE ARE BUYING FUEL FROM THE STATES WE'VE GOT BILLIONS IN COPPER AND OIL BUT CAN'T TOUCH THEM WE SHOULD HAVE SOME OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST MANUFACTURING PLANTS
AND IT PLEASED HIM TO THINK SHE WOULD HAVE MADE THIS SAME FIGHT FOR ALASKA IF SHE HAD LIVED IT WAS A THOUGHT WHICH BROUGHT A PAINFUL THICKENING IN HIS BREATH FOR ALWAYS THESE VISIONS WHICH OLAF COULD NOT SEE ENDED WITH MARY STANDISH
AND THE DUKE OF CUMBERLAND CAME DOWN TO REVIEW THEM
AND ARE RISING UP TO THE HIGHER GROUND OF THE COUNTRY OF THE PINES AND THE LAKES LOOK FROM THE WINDOW AS YOU GO THE CITY IS FAR BEHIND NOW
BUT OF COURSE HOME WOULD HARDLY BE THE WORD YOU WOULD APPLY TO THE LITTLE TOWN UNLESS PERHAPS LATE AT NIGHT WHEN YOU'D BEEN SITTING READING IN A QUIET CORNER SOMEWHERE SUCH A BOOK AS THE PRESENT ONE NATURALLY YOU DON'T KNOW OF THE MARIPOSA TRAIN NOW
TO THE FORCES ASSEMBLING IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT
AND SAT WATCHING OLAF AS HE MOTHERED THE HALF BAKED BANNOCK LOAF IT MADE HIM THINK OF HIS FATHER A THOUSAND TIMES THE TWO MUST HAVE CAMPED LIKE THIS IN THE DAYS WHEN ALASKA WAS NEW AND THERE WERE NO MAPS TO TELL THEM WHAT LAY BEYOND THE NEXT RANGE
YOU USED TO WANDER DOWN TO THE STATION ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AFTER YOUR WORK AND WATCH THE MARIPOSA PEOPLE GETTING ON THE TRAIN AND WISH THAT YOU COULD GO WHY YOU KNEW THAT TRAIN AT ONE TIME BETTER I SUPPOSE THAN ANY OTHER SINGLE THING IN THE CITY
LIKE A SMOLDERING CLOUD BUT YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE DANGER HE SAID IT WON'T COME FROM JAPAN TO CALIFORNIA IT WILL POUR LIKE A FLOOD THROUGH SIBERIA AND JUMP TO ALASKA IN A NIGHT IT ISN'T THE DANGER OF THE YELLOW MAN ALONE OLAF
MOST FORTUNATELY WOLFE WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO TAKE ILL AND SO HE WAS SENT HOME IN TIME TO SAVE HIM FROM THE FEVERS OF SPANISH AMERICA WOLFE WAS HAPPY TO SEE HIS MOTHER AGAIN TO HAVE HIS PONY TO RIDE AND HIS DOGS TO PLAY WITH
ONE TWO THREE
WHEN THE SQUIRE HANDED HIM HIS FIRST COMMISSION AND THERE IT IS TO DAY AND ON IT ARE THE VERSES ENDING THIS SPOT SO SACRED WILL FOREVER CLAIM A PROUD ALLIANCE WITH ITS HERO'S NAME WOLFE WAS AT LAST AN OFFICER
TWICE HE HAD TRIED IT SINCE HIS OLD COMRADE HAD DIED AND TWICE HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN OUT THE NEXT TIME HE WOULD KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT AND HE INVITED ALAN TO GO WITH HIM THERE WAS A THRILL IN THIS TALK OF A LAND SO NEAR
YOU WOULD TAKE THE TRAIN AND GO BACK TO THE LITTLE TOWN TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE NOW AND IF THINGS HAD CHANGED MUCH SINCE YOUR DAY BUT EACH TIME WHEN YOUR HOLIDAYS CAME SOMEHOW YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND AND WENT DOWN TO
AND SMILED GRIMLY INTO OLAF'S BEARDED FACE THEN WE CAN COUNT ON THAT THING COMING ACROSS THE NECK OF SEA FROM THE GULF OF ANADYR HE FINISHED AND IF IT EVER DOES COME THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES WILL AT LAST
THIS IS LAKE OSSAWIPPI SURELY ENOUGH YOU WOULD KNOW IT ANYWHERE BY THE BROAD STILL BLACK WATER WITH HARDLY A RIPPLE AND WITH THE GRIP OF THE COMING FROST ALREADY ON IT SUCH A GREAT SHEET OF BLACKNESS IT LOOKS AS THE TRAIN THUNDERS ALONG THE SIDE
A LONG PEACE HAD MADE THE COUNTRY INDIFFERENT TO THE WELFARE OF THE ARMY AND NAVY NOW MEN WERE SUDDENLY BEING MASSED TOGETHER IN CAMPS AND FLEETS AS IF ON PURPOSE TO BREED DISEASE SANITATION ON A LARGE SCALE NEVER HAVING BEEN PRACTISED IN PEACE
ANY LIFE OF WOLFE CAN BE ARTIFICIALLY SIMPLIFIED BY TREATING HIS PURELY MILITARY WORK AS SOMETHING COMPLETE IN ITSELF
THE OLD FLASH WAS IN HIS EYES AND HE WAS SEEING THE FIGHT AHEAD OF HIM AGAIN THE FIGHT TO DO HIS BIT IN STRIKING THE SHACKLES OF MISGOVERNMENT FROM ALASKA AND ROUSING THE WORLD TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MENACE WHICH HUNG OVER HER
AND BUSINESSLIKE INTENTION OF SIFTING THE MATTER TO THE BOTTOM THAT HE MIGHT DISPROVE HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY AND SET HIMSELF RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES IN SELF DEFENSE HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ROSSLAND AN OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK DOWN WITH COLD FACTS
YES AND THE BEST TOO THE MOST COMFORTABLE THE MOST RELIABLE THE MOST LUXURIOUS AND THE SPEEDIEST TRAIN THAT EVER TURNED A WHEEL AND THE MOST GENIAL
J WOLFE TO MISSUS WOLFE AT HER HOUSE IN GREENWICH KENT WOLFE'S VERY GOOD STATE OF HEALTH WAS NOT LIKELY TO CONTINUE SO EITHER IN CAMP OR ON BOARD SHIP
AND HAD CHOSEN IT FOR REASONS OF HIS OWN IT WAS PRIMITIVE AND ALIVE WITH BIRDS OLAF LOVED THE BIRDS AND THE CHEER OF THEIR VESPER SONG AND BEDTIME TWITTER COMFORTED ALAN HE SEIZED AN AX
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVEN MONTHS HIS MUSCLES RESPONDED TO THE SWING OF IT AND ERICKSEN OLD AS HIS YEARS IN THE WAY OF THE NORTH WHISTLED LOUDLY AND RUMBLED A BIT OF CRUDE SONG THROUGH HIS BEARD AS HE LIGHTED A FIRE
IT WAS TO BE ONE OF THE GRANDEST AND FINEST HOUSES THAT THOUGHT COULD CONCEIVE MUCH FINER IN TRUE REALITY THAN THAT VAST PALACE OF SANDSTONE WITH THE PORTE COCHERE AND THE SWEEPING CONSERVATORIES THAT YOU AFTERWARDS BUILT IN THE COSTLIER PART OF THE CITY
IT MAY BE A GENERATION FROM NOW MAYBE A CENTURY BUT IT'S COMING SURE AS GOD MAKES LIGHT IF WE LET ALASKA GO DOWN AND OUT AND MY WAY OF PREVENTING IT IS DIFFERENT FROM YOURS HE STARED INTO THE FIRE
YOU'VE GOT TO COMBINE THAT WITH BOLSHEVISM THE MENACE OF BLACKEST RUSSIA A DISEASE WHICH IF IT CROSSES THE LITTLE NECK OF WATER AND GETS HOLD OF ALASKA WILL SHAKE THE AMERICAN CONTINENT TO BED ROCK
SIBERIA WAS DRAGGING HIM THAT FORBIDDEN WORLD OF ADVENTURE AND MYSTERY AND MONUMENTAL OPPORTUNITY WHICH LAY ONLY A FEW MILES ACROSS THE STRAIT FROM THE SEWARD PENINSULA IN HIS ENTHUSIASM HE FORGOT ALAN'S TRAGEDY
IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY NINE THE OTHER HOUSE IS SQUERRYES COURT BELONGING THEN AND NOW TO THE WARDE FAMILY THE WOLFES CLOSEST FRIENDS WOLFE AND GEORGE WARDE WERE CHUMS FROM THE FIRST DAY THEY MET
MARIPOSA PEOPLE OH YES THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF THEM ON THE TRAIN EVERY DAY BUT OF COURSE YOU HARDLY RECOGNIZE THEM WHILE THE TRAIN IS STILL PASSING THROUGH THE SUBURBS
AND HE HEARD THE GIRL'S VOICE ANSWERING THEM IN HER HAPPINESS AND TURNING THAT HAPPINESS FROM THE RADIANCE OF HER EYES UPON HIM
WHILE HE WAS ATTENDING TO HIS AFFAIRS AT THE BANK OLAF SECURED INFORMATION THAT ROSSLAND WAS RESTING COMFORTABLY IN THE HOSPITAL AND HAD NOT ONE CHANCE IN TEN OF DYING IT WAS NOT ALAN'S INTENTION TO SEE HIM
HIS OLD AMBITIONS AND HIS DREAMS OF ACHIEVEMENT THEY SEEMED PULSELESS AND DEAD NOW BUT HE KNEW IT WAS BECAUSE HIS OWN FIRE HAD TEMPORARILY BURNED OUT AND HE REALIZED THE VITAL NECESSITY OF BUILDING IT UP AGAIN
BUT HE FULL OF THE STIR AND EXCITEMENT OF A BIG CAMP HAD CARRIED THE LETTER IN HIS POCKET FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE ANSWERING IT THEN HE WROTE HER THE FIRST OF MANY LETTERS FROM DIFFERENT SEATS OF WAR THE LAST ONE OF ALL BEING WRITTEN JUST BEFORE HE WON THE VICTORY
BESIDES IF IT IS NOT I WOULD DO IT OUT OF LOVE WITH PLEASURE I AM SORRY TO HEAR THAT YOUR HEAD IS SO BAD WHICH I FEAR IS CAUSED BY YOUR BEING SO MELANCHOLY BUT PRAY DEAR MAMMA IF YOU LOVE ME DON'T GIVE YOURSELF UP TO FEARS FOR US
THAT THE TRAIN WAS THERE EVERY AFTERNOON PUFFING UP STEAM IN THE CITY STATION AND THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BOARDED IT ANY DAY AND GONE HOME NO NOT HOME OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T CALL IT HOME NOW
THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT AND HAPPY WAS SHE FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE IN THE POWER THOUGH AS FAR AS SHE WAS HERSELF CONCERNED IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON
BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL
THIS WILL CERTAINLY BE THE BEGINNING OF ONE OF OUR QUARRELS ABOUT EMMA MISTER KNIGHTLEY
FROM THE OPPOSITION OF TWO LEADING PRINCIPLES SHE WAS OF STRICT INTEGRITY HERSELF WITH A DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR BUT SHE WAS AS DESIROUS OF SAVING SIR WALTER'S FEELINGS AS SOLICITOUS FOR THE CREDIT OF THE FAMILY
AS TO HAVE BEEN ALREADY STAYING THERE MORE THAN ONCE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT LADY RUSSELL WHO THOUGHT IT A FRIENDSHIP QUITE OUT OF PLACE COULD HINT OF CAUTION AND RESERVE LADY RUSSELL INDEED HAD SCARCELY ANY INFLUENCE WITH ELIZABETH
WHICH HAD BEEN HAPPILY ENGRAFTED ON THE BEGINNING HE WAS NOT ONLY TO QUIT HIS HOME BUT TO SEE IT IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS A TRIAL OF FORTITUDE WHICH STRONGER HEADS THAN SIR WALTER'S HAVE FOUND TOO MUCH KELLYNCH HALL WAS TO BE LET
AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO
A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUSTICE AND EQUITY IF WE CAN PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO ALL THIS SAID LADY RUSSELL LOOKING OVER HER PAPER MUCH MAY BE DONE IF HE WILL ADOPT THESE REGULATIONS IN SEVEN YEARS HE WILL BE CLEAR
AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY THE HAPPINESS OF MISS SMITH WAS QUITE EQUAL TO HER INTENTIONS MISS WOODHOUSE WAS SO GREAT A PERSONAGE IN HIGHBURY
IN WHATEVER WAY HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE OF DOUBT AND INDECISION THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT
AND PERHAPS NO MAN CAN BE A GOOD JUDGE OF THE COMFORT A WOMAN FEELS IN THE SOCIETY OF ONE OF HER OWN SEX AFTER BEING USED TO IT ALL HER LIFE I CAN IMAGINE YOUR OBJECTION TO HARRIET SMITH SHE IS NOT THE SUPERIOR YOUNG WOMAN WHICH EMMA'S FRIEND OUGHT TO BE
EMMA MUST DO HARRIET GOOD AND BY SUPPLYING HER WITH A NEW OBJECT OF INTEREST HARRIET MAY BE SAID TO DO EMMA GOOD I HAVE BEEN SEEING THEIR INTIMACY WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE HOW VERY DIFFERENTLY WE FEEL NOT THINK THEY WILL DO EACH OTHER ANY GOOD
THAT THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE AND THE SUPPER TABLE WHICH ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE
THE LIST SHE DREW UP WHEN ONLY FOURTEEN I REMEMBER THINKING IT DID HER JUDGMENT SO MUCH CREDIT THAT I PRESERVED IT SOME TIME AND I DARE SAY SHE MAY HAVE MADE OUT A VERY GOOD LIST NOW BUT I HAVE DONE WITH EXPECTING ANY COURSE OF STEADY READING FROM EMMA
THAT THE PROSPECT OF THE INTRODUCTION HAD GIVEN AS MUCH PANIC AS PLEASURE BUT THE HUMBLE GRATEFUL LITTLE GIRL WENT OFF WITH HIGHLY GRATIFIED FEELINGS
I HOPE NOT THAT IT IS NOT LIKELY NO MISTER KNIGHTLEY DO NOT FORETELL VEXATION FROM THAT QUARTER NOT I INDEED I ONLY NAME POSSIBILITIES I DO NOT PRETEND TO EMMA'S GENIUS FOR FORETELLING AND GUESSING
THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS
ELIZABETH HAD BEEN LATELY FORMING AN INTIMACY WHICH SHE WISHED TO SEE INTERRUPTED IT WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER SHEPHERD WHO HAD RETURNED AFTER AN UNPROSPEROUS MARRIAGE TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE WITH THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF TWO CHILDREN
BY PASSING ALL THE WARM MONTHS WITH HER AT KELLYNCH LODGE EVERY DANGER WOULD BE AVOIDED AND IT WAS IN FACT A CHANGE WHICH MUST DO BOTH HEALTH AND SPIRITS GOOD ANNE HAD BEEN TOO LITTLE FROM HOME TOO LITTLE SEEN HER SPIRITS WERE NOT HIGH
SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING SHE CONSULTED ANNE WHO NEVER SEEMED CONSIDERED BY THE OTHERS AS HAVING ANY INTEREST IN THE QUESTION SHE CONSULTED AND IN A DEGREE WAS INFLUENCED BY HER
THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS
THERE IS AN ANXIETY A CURIOSITY IN WHAT ONE FEELS FOR EMMA I WONDER WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER SO DO I SAID MISSUS WESTON GENTLY VERY MUCH
OR A KINDER SISTER OR A TRUER FRIEND NO NO SHE HAS QUALITIES WHICH MAY BE TRUSTED SHE WILL NEVER LEAD ANY ONE REALLY WRONG SHE WILL MAKE NO LASTING BLUNDER WHERE EMMA ERRS ONCE SHE IS IN THE RIGHT A HUNDRED TIMES
IT HAS BEEN SO MANY YEARS MY PROVINCE TO GIVE ADVICE THAT YOU CANNOT BE SURPRIZED MISTER KNIGHTLEY AT THIS LITTLE REMAINS OF OFFICE NOT AT ALL CRIED HE I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR IT
PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
AND YET SHE WAS A HAPPY WOMAN AND A WOMAN WHOM NO ONE NAMED WITHOUT GOOD WILL IT WAS HER OWN UNIVERSAL GOOD WILL AND CONTENTED TEMPER WHICH WORKED SUCH WONDERS SHE LOVED EVERY BODY
HE WOULD SOONER QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AT ONCE THAN REMAIN IN IT ON SUCH DISGRACEFUL TERMS QUIT KELLYNCH HALL THE HINT WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN UP BY MISTER SHEPHERD WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S RETRENCHING
HIS CARE FOR THEIR HEALTH MADE HIM GRIEVE THAT THEY WOULD EAT SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND
I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF EMMA'S DOCTRINES GIVE ANY STRENGTH OF MIND OR TEND AT ALL TO MAKE A GIRL ADAPT HERSELF RATIONALLY
HARTFIELD WILL ONLY PUT HER OUT OF CONCEIT WITH ALL THE OTHER PLACES SHE BELONGS TO SHE WILL GROW JUST REFINED ENOUGH TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THOSE AMONG WHOM BIRTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE PLACED HER HOME
AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL
MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT
I CONSIDER MYSELF YOU KNOW AS HAVING SOMEWHAT OF THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEECH THAT EMMA'S MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD THE LIBERTY OF HINTING THAT I DO NOT THINK ANY POSSIBLE GOOD CAN ARISE FROM HARRIET SMITH'S INTIMACY BEING MADE A MATTER OF MUCH DISCUSSION AMONG YOU PRAY EXCUSE ME
AND STILL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES SEEING THE LAWNS AND GROVES OF KELLYNCH WAS THE OBJECT OF HER AMBITION BUT THE USUAL FATE OF ANNE ATTENDED HER IN HAVING SOMETHING VERY OPPOSITE FROM HER INCLINATION FIXED ON SHE DISLIKED BATH AND DID NOT THINK IT AGREED WITH HER
WHAT EVERY COMFORT OF LIFE KNOCKED OFF JOURNEYS LONDON SERVANTS HORSES TABLE CONTRACTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS EVERY WHERE TO LIVE NO LONGER WITH THE DECENCIES EVEN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN NO
SHE ALWAYS DECLARES SHE WILL NEVER MARRY WHICH OF COURSE MEANS JUST NOTHING AT ALL BUT I HAVE NO IDEA THAT SHE HAS YET EVER SEEN A MAN SHE CARED FOR IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD THING FOR HER TO BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH A PROPER OBJECT
LADY RUSSELL WAS MOST ANXIOUSLY ZEALOUS ON THE SUBJECT AND GAVE IT MUCH SERIOUS CONSIDERATION SHE WAS A WOMAN RATHER OF SOUND THAN OF QUICK ABILITIES WHOSE DIFFICULTIES IN COMING TO ANY DECISION IN THIS INSTANCE WERE GREAT
THERE IS HARDLY ANY DESIRING TO REFRESH SUCH A MEMORY AS THAT SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY FEELINGLY AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE HAD DONE BUT I HE SOON ADDED WHO HAVE HAD NO SUCH CHARM THROWN OVER MY SENSES
THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM AND THE SMILES OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING THROWN AWAY
SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT
IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT SIR WALTER COULD MATERIALLY ALTER HIS STYLE OF LIVING IN A HOUSE WHICH HAD SUCH A CHARACTER OF HOSPITALITY AND ANCIENT DIGNITY TO SUPPORT IN ANY OTHER PLACE SIR WALTER MIGHT JUDGE FOR HIMSELF AND WOULD BE LOOKED UP TO AS REGULATING THE MODES OF LIFE
SHE HAD A VALUE FOR RANK AND CONSEQUENCE WHICH BLINDED HER A LITTLE TO THE FAULTS OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED THEM HERSELF THE WIDOW OF ONLY A KNIGHT SHE GAVE THE DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE AND SIR WALTER
MUST STILL SEE HEAR AND REMEMBER EMMA IS SPOILED BY BEING THE CLEVEREST OF HER FAMILY AT TEN YEARS OLD SHE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHICH PUZZLED HER SISTER AT SEVENTEEN SHE WAS ALWAYS QUICK AND ASSURED
AND WHO WAS PERFECTLY PERSUADED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE WITHOUT A CHANGE OF ABODE SINCE THE IDEA HAD BEEN STARTED IN THE VERY QUARTER WHICH OUGHT TO DICTATE HE HAD NO SCRUPLE HE SAID IN CONFESSING HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE
AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET AMONG THE MOST COME AT ABLE OF WHOM WERE MISSUS AND MISS BATES AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD
AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER THAN BECAUSE ELIZABETH DESERVED IT SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION
TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MISTER WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS YOUTH
SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS HER YOUTH HAD PASSED WITHOUT DISTINCTION AND HER MIDDLE OF LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE CARE OF A FAILING MOTHER AND THE ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE A SMALL INCOME GO AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
KNOWING WESTON TO BE OUT AND THAT YOU MUST STILL FIGHT YOUR OWN BATTLE MISTER WESTON WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORT ME IF HE WERE HERE FOR HE THINKS EXACTLY AS I DO ON THE SUBJECT WE WERE SPEAKING OF IT ONLY YESTERDAY AND AGREEING HOW FORTUNATE IT WAS FOR EMMA
BUT YOU WERE PREPARING YOURSELF TO BE AN EXCELLENT WIFE ALL THE TIME YOU WERE AT HARTFIELD YOU MIGHT NOT GIVE EMMA SUCH A COMPLETE EDUCATION AS YOUR POWERS WOULD SEEM TO PROMISE BUT YOU WERE RECEIVING A VERY GOOD EDUCATION FROM HER
STRICT IN HER NOTIONS OF DECORUM AND WITH MANNERS THAT WERE HELD A STANDARD OF GOOD BREEDING SHE HAD A CULTIVATED MIND AND WAS GENERALLY SPEAKING RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT BUT SHE HAD PREJUDICES ON THE SIDE OF ANCESTRY
MADE HIM UNFIT FOR ANY ACQUAINTANCE BUT SUCH AS WOULD VISIT HIM ON HIS OWN TERMS FORTUNATELY FOR HIM HIGHBURY INCLUDING RANDALLS IN THE SAME PARISH AND DONWELL ABBEY IN THE PARISH ADJOINING THE SEAT OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY
IN MARKING OUT THE SCHEME OF RETRENCHMENT WHICH WAS AT LAST SUBMITTED TO SIR WALTER EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT
I WILL NOT RAISE ANY OUTCRY I WILL KEEP MY ILL HUMOUR TO MYSELF I HAVE A VERY SINCERE INTEREST IN EMMA ISABELLA DOES NOT SEEM MORE MY SISTER HAS NEVER EXCITED A GREATER INTEREST PERHAPS HARDLY SO GREAT
SHE CONSIDERED IT AS AN ACT OF INDISPENSABLE DUTY TO CLEAR AWAY THE CLAIMS OF CREDITORS WITH ALL THE EXPEDITION WHICH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RETRENCHMENTS COULD SECURE AND SAW NO DIGNITY IN ANYTHING SHORT OF IT SHE WANTED IT TO BE PRESCRIBED
YOU MIGHT BE SURE THAT IT WOULD BE MAGNIFIED AND SPREAD OVER BOTH NOSE AND MOUTH
SHE THEN SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT HER HOT TEARS FELL JUST WHERE A ROSE BUSH HAD SUNK AND WHEN HER WARM TEARS WATERED THE GROUND THE TREE SHOT UP SUDDENLY AS FRESH AND BLOOMING AS WHEN IT HAD BEEN SWALLOWED UP GERDA KISSED THE ROSES
AND KAY TIED ON HIS SLEDGE AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD AND OFF HE DROVE WITH IT ON THEY WENT QUICKER AND QUICKER INTO THE NEXT STREET AND THE PERSON WHO DROVE TURNED ROUND TO KAY AND NODDED TO HIM IN A FRIENDLY MANNER JUST AS IF THEY KNEW EACH OTHER
WHERE COULD HE BE NOBODY KNEW NOBODY COULD GIVE ANY INTELLIGENCE ALL THE BOYS KNEW WAS THAT THEY HAD SEEN HIM TIE HIS SLEDGE TO ANOTHER LARGE AND SPLENDID ONE WHICH DROVE DOWN THE STREET AND OUT OF THE TOWN
FOR A MINUTE OR TWO ALICE STOOD SILENT WATCHING HIM SUDDENLY SHE BRIGHTENED UP
AND AT THAT DISTANCE TOO WHY IT'S AS MUCH AS I CAN DO TO SEE REAL PEOPLE BY THIS LIGHT ALL THIS WAS LOST ON ALICE WHO WAS STILL LOOKING INTENTLY ALONG THE ROAD SHADING HER EYES WITH ONE HAND
AND SHE RAN ABOUT AMONGST THE FLOWERBEDS AND LOOKED AND LOOKED
THE KING SAID WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING ROUND THAT WOOD'S FULL OF THEM
THE LION SAID LYING DOWN AND PUTTING HIS CHIN ON THIS PAWS AND SIT DOWN BOTH OF YOU TO THE KING AND THE UNICORN
AND SLOPES WITH SHEEP AND COWS BUT NOT A HUMAN BEING WAS TO BE SEEN PERHAPS THE RIVER WILL CARRY ME TO LITTLE KAY
AND THE GUTTER RAN ALONG THE EXTREME END OF IT THERE WAS TO EACH HOUSE A SMALL WINDOW ONE NEEDED ONLY TO STEP OVER THE GUTTER TO GET FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER THE CHILDREN'S PARENTS HAD LARGE WOODEN BOXES THERE
THE KING WAS EVIDENTLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AT HAVING TO SIT DOWN BETWEEN THE TWO GREAT CREATURES
AND THE CHILDREN HELD EACH OTHER BY THE HAND KISSED THE ROSES LOOKED UP AT THE CLEAR SUNSHINE AND SPOKE AS THOUGH THEY REALLY SAW ANGELS THERE WHAT LOVELY SUMMER DAYS THOSE WERE HOW DELIGHTFUL TO BE OUT IN THE AIR NEAR THE FRESH ROSE BUSHES
AND THEN IT MADE ONE SHUDDER FOR THEIR HEART BECAME LIKE A LUMP OF ICE SOME OF THE BROKEN PIECES WERE SO LARGE THAT THEY WERE USED FOR WINDOWPANES THROUGH WHICH ONE COULD NOT SEE ONE'S FRIENDS OTHER PIECES WERE PUT IN SPECTACLES
AND AS HE PERCEIVED HER FRIGHT HE PULLED UP ANOTHER ROSE GOT IN AT THE WINDOW AND HASTENED OFF FROM DEAR LITTLE GERDA AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE BROUGHT HER PICTURE BOOK HE ASKED WHAT HORRID BEASTS HAVE YOU THERE
THE TENDRILS OF THE PEAS HUNG DOWN OVER THE BOXES AND THE ROSE TREES SHOT UP LONG BRANCHES TWINED ROUND THE WINDOWS AND THEN BENT TOWARDS EACH OTHER IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A TRIUMPHANT ARCH OF FOLIAGE AND FLOWERS
AND THIS TIME A TEAR OR TWO TRICKLED DOWN HIS CHEEK BUT NOT A WORD WOULD HE SAY SPEAK CAN'T YOU HAIGHA CRIED IMPATIENTLY
AND STOOD FOR SOME TIME LOOKING AT HER WITH AN AIR OF THE DEEPEST DISGUST
SHE ROSE AND LOOKED FOR MANY HOURS AT THE BEAUTIFUL GREEN BANKS PRESENTLY SHE SAILED BY A LARGE CHERRY ORCHARD
CHAPTER SEVEN THE LION AND THE UNICORN THE NEXT MOMENT SOLDIERS CAME RUNNING THROUGH THE WOOD AT FIRST IN TWOS AND THREES THEN TEN OR TWENTY TOGETHER AND AT LAST IN SUCH CROWDS
IN THE LARGE HUGE EMPTY SPACE ABOVE HIM AND ON SHE FLEW WITH HIM FLEW HIGH OVER THE BLACK CLOUDS WHILE THE STORM MOANED AND WHISTLED AS THOUGH IT WERE SINGING SOME OLD TUNE
ASKED THE LITTLE BOY FOR HE KNEW THAT THE HONEY BEES ALWAYS HAVE ONE
I SAID THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE IT WHICH ALICE DID NOT VENTURE TO DENY WHO DID YOU PASS ON THE ROAD THE KING WENT ON HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO THE MESSENGER FOR SOME MORE HAY
SO SHE CLAMBERED INTO A BOAT WHICH LAY AMONG THE RUSHES WENT TO THE FARTHEST END AND THREW OUT THE SHOES BUT THE BOAT WAS NOT FASTENED AND THE MOTION WHICH SHE OCCASIONED MADE IT DRIFT FROM THE SHORE SHE OBSERVED THIS AND HASTENED TO GET BACK
WHICH THE POOR KING WAS NEARLY SHAKING OFF HIS HEAD HE TREMBLED SO MUCH
THERE WAS AN END OF THIS PLEASURE THE WINDOWS WERE OFTEN FROZEN OVER BUT THEN THEY HEATED COPPER FARTHINGS ON THE STOVE AND LAID THE HOT FARTHING ON THE WINDOWPANE AND THEN THEY HAD A CAPITAL PEEP HOLE QUITE NICELY ROUNDED
ALICE TOOK A PIECE TO TASTE BUT IT WAS VERY DRY I DON'T THINK THEY'LL FIGHT ANY MORE TO DAY THE KING SAID TO HATTA GO AND ORDER THE DRUMS TO BEGIN AND HATTA WENT BOUNDING AWAY LIKE A GRASSHOPPER
THE GLASS THAT WAS STICKING IN HIS HEART WHICH MADE HIM TEASE EVEN LITTLE GERDA WHOSE WHOLE SOUL WAS DEVOTED TO HIM HIS GAMES NOW WERE QUITE DIFFERENT TO WHAT THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN THEY WERE SO VERY KNOWING ONE WINTER'S DAY WHEN THE FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FLYING ABOUT
THE LITTLE GIRL PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK HE WINKED HIS EYES NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN
THEY WERE NOT BROTHER AND SISTER BUT THEY CARED FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS IF THEY WERE THEIR PARENTS LIVED EXACTLY OPPOSITE THEY INHABITED TWO GARRETS AND WHERE THE ROOF OF THE ONE HOUSE JOINED THAT OF THE OTHER
THE UNICORN WENT ON TURNING FROM HER TO THE KING NONE OF YOUR BROWN BREAD FOR ME CERTAINLY CERTAINLY THE KING MUTTERED AND BECKONED TO HAIGHA OPEN THE BAG HE WHISPERED QUICK NOT THAT ONE
DRESSED IN THE FINEST WHITE GAUZE MADE OF A MILLION LITTLE FLAKES LIKE STARS SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
THE UNICORN LOOKED DREAMILY AT ALICE AND SAID TALK CHILD
SAID KAY THAT'S MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN REAL FLOWERS
STILL SEEMED TO GERDA THAT ONE WAS WANTING THOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW WHICH ONE DAY WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING AT THE HAT OF THE OLD WOMAN PAINTED WITH FLOWERS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEM ALL SEEMED TO HER TO BE A ROSE
SHE'S A DEAR GOOD CREATURE HE REPEATED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF
DOUBLE E AT THIS MOMENT THE UNICORN SAUNTERED BY THEM WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS I HAD THE BEST OF IT THIS TIME HE SAID TO THE KING JUST GLANCING AT HIM AS HE PASSED
THE LION BEAT THE UNICORN ALL ROUND THE TOWN SOME GAVE THEM WHITE BREAD SOME GAVE THEM BROWN SOME GAVE THEM PLUM CAKE AND DRUMMED THEM OUT OF TOWN DOES THE ONE THAT WINS GET THE CROWN
SAID THE MESSENGER QUITE RIGHT SAID THE KING THIS YOUNG LADY SAW HIM TOO SO OF COURSE NOBODY WALKS SLOWER THAN YOU
SO THEY TROTTED ON IN SILENCE TILL THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF A GREAT CROWD IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH THE LION AND UNICORN WERE FIGHTING THEY WERE IN SUCH A CLOUD OF DUST THAT AT FIRST ALICE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHICH WAS WHICH
THEY WERE ALWAYS TRIPPING OVER SOMETHING OR OTHER AND WHENEVER ONE WENT DOWN SEVERAL MORE ALWAYS FELL OVER HIM SO THAT THE GROUND WAS SOON COVERED WITH LITTLE HEAPS OF MEN THEN CAME THE HORSES HAVING FOUR FEET
SAID BOTH THE CHILDREN AND SO THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS TRUE CAN THE SNOW QUEEN COME IN
SHE STARTED TO HER FEET AND SPRANG ACROSS THE LITTLE BROOK IN HER TERROR
AND NOW WE SHALL HEAR WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SECOND STORY A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL IN A LARGE TOWN WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY HOUSES AND SO MANY PEOPLE
OVER SEAS AND MANY LANDS AND BENEATH THEM
IT WAS SO CAPITAL JUST AS THEY WERE IN THE VERY HEIGHT OF THEIR AMUSEMENT A LARGE SLEDGE PASSED BY
FOR THE MESSENGER KEPT SKIPPING UP AND DOWN AND WRIGGLING LIKE AN EEL AS HE CAME ALONG
AND POOR KAY HAD GOT ANOTHER PIECE RIGHT IN HIS HEART
KAY IS DEAD AND GONE
PAINTED WITH THE MOST SPLENDID FLOWERS POOR LITTLE CHILD SAID THE OLD WOMAN HOW DID YOU GET UPON THE LARGE RAPID RIVER TO BE DRIVEN ABOUT SO IN THE WIDE WORLD AND THEN THE OLD WOMAN WENT INTO THE WATER
STILL THE LITTLE VEHICLE RUSHED ON WITH THE QUICKNESS OF THE WIND
BUT HE NO DOUBT WOULD COME AND SHE TOLD HER NOT TO BE CAST DOWN BUT TASTE HER CHERRIES AND LOOK AT HER FLOWERS WHICH WERE FINER THAN ANY IN A PICTURE BOOK EACH OF WHICH COULD TELL A WHOLE STORY SHE THEN TOOK GERDA BY THE HAND
AND THAT NOW ONLY AS THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW THE WORLD REALLY LOOKED THEY RAN ABOUT WITH THE MIRROR
THE ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDES ONLY GOT MORE EXTRAORDINARY EVERY MOMENT WHILE THE GREAT EYES ROLLED WILDLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
AND ONE THE LARGEST OF ALL REMAINED LYING ON THE EDGE OF A FLOWER POT THE FLAKE OF SNOW GREW LARGER AND LARGER
IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF HE WERE ABOUT TO DIE BUT A MOMENT MORE
THE NEXT DAY IT WAS A SHARP FROST AND THEN THE SPRING CAME THE SUN SHONE THE GREEN LEAVES APPEARED THE SWALLOWS BUILT THEIR NESTS THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED AND THE LITTLE CHILDREN AGAIN SAT IN THEIR PRETTY GARDEN
YET SHE LIVED HER EYES GAZED FIXEDLY LIKE TWO STARS BUT THERE WAS NEITHER QUIET NOR REPOSE IN THEM SHE NODDED TOWARDS THE WINDOW AND BECKONED WITH HER HAND THE LITTLE BOY WAS FRIGHTENED
NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WAS MANY SAD TEARS WERE SHED AND LITTLE GERDA WEPT LONG AND BITTERLY AT LAST SHE SAID HE MUST BE DEAD
ALICE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THE BANK OF A LITTLE BROOK WITH THE GREAT DISH ON HER KNEES
AND TWICE AS NATURAL I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY WERE FABULOUS MONSTERS SAID THE UNICORN IS IT ALIVE IT CAN TALK SAID HAIGHA SOLEMNLY
I SEE NOBODY ON THE ROAD
THAT HE KNEW THE NUMBER OF SQUARE MILES THERE WERE IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND HOW MANY INHABITANTS THEY CONTAINED AND SHE SMILED WHILE HE SPOKE IT THEN SEEMED TO HIM AS IF WHAT HE KNEW WAS NOT ENOUGH AND HE LOOKED UPWARDS
IF THEY DID NOT MELT IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER THIS THAT KAY CAME ONE DAY WITH LARGE GLOVES ON AND HIS LITTLE SLEDGE AT HIS BACK AND BAWLED RIGHT INTO GERDA'S EARS I HAVE PERMISSION TO GO OUT INTO THE SQUARE
WE SHALL KNOW MORE THAN WE KNOW NOW BUT TO BEGIN ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A WICKED SPRITE INDEED HE WAS THE MOST MISCHIEVOUS OF ALL SPRITES ONE DAY HE WAS IN A VERY GOOD HUMOR FOR HE HAD MADE A MIRROR
THE SNOW QUEEN FIRST STORY WHICH TREATS OF A MIRROR AND OF THE SPLINTERS NOW THEN LET US BEGIN
SAID THE KING HE'S AN ANGLO SAXON MESSENGER AND THOSE ARE ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDES
BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM THE SNOW DRIFTED AND THE SLEDGE FLEW ON AND SOMETIMES IT GAVE A JERK AS THOUGH THEY WERE DRIVING OVER HEDGES AND DITCHES HE WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED AND HE TRIED TO REPEAT THE LORD'S PRAYER BUT ALL HE COULD DO HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO REMEMBER THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE
IT WAS THE SNOW QUEEN WE HAVE TRAVELLED FAST SAID SHE BUT IT IS FREEZINGLY COLD COME UNDER MY BEARSKIN AND SHE PUT HIM IN THE SLEDGE BESIDE HER WRAPPED THE FUR ROUND HIM AND HE FELT AS THOUGH HE WERE SINKING IN A SNOW WREATH
AND HAD AS PLEASANT DREAMS AS EVER A QUEEN ON HER WEDDING DAY THE NEXT MORNING SHE WENT TO PLAY WITH THE FLOWERS IN THE WARM SUNSHINE AND THUS PASSED AWAY A DAY GERDA KNEW EVERY FLOWER AND NUMEROUS AS THEY WERE IT
THIS HE SAID AT LAST
IT WAS THATCHED AND BEFORE IT TWO WOODEN SOLDIERS STOOD SENTRY AND PRESENTED ARMS WHEN ANYONE WENT PAST GERDA CALLED TO THEM FOR SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE ALIVE BUT THEY OF COURSE DID NOT ANSWER SHE CAME CLOSE TO THEM
THE LION HAD JOINED THEM WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON HE LOOKED VERY TIRED AND SLEEPY AND HIS EYES WERE HALF SHUT
HOW DOES HE KNOW YOUR GRANDMOTHER THEN HE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE ONE OF HER SORT
THEY'RE GOING TO TEACH ME SOME DAY SOON
BUT LITTLE BOY BLUE WAS NOT CONTENT CALLING FOR FOLLOWERS STILL AS HE WENT BLOWING HIS HORN AND BEATING HIS DRUM AND CRYING ALOUD COME ALL OF YOU COME HE SAID TO THE SHADOWS COME AFTER ME
SAID THE SACK BACKED SQUIRREL AND HE TURNED HIS SACK WITH A SWING AND A SWIRL SAID THE COCK OF THE SPIRE
LITTLE BOY BLUE LITTLE BOY BLUE LOST HIS WAY IN A WOOD SING APPLES AND CHERRIES ROSES AND HONEY HE SAID I WOULD NOT GO BACK IF I COULD IT'S ALL SO JOLLY AND FUNNY
CHAPTER TWENTY DIAMOND LEARNS TO READ THE QUESTION OF THE TALL GENTLEMAN AS TO WHETHER DIAMOND COULD READ OR NOT SET HIS FATHER THINKING IT WAS HIGH TIME HE COULD
HE CAME WHERE THE APPLES GREW RED AND SWEET TREE DROP ME AN APPLE DOWN AT MY FEET HE CAME WHERE THE CHERRIES HUNG PLUMP AND RED COME TO MY MOUTH SWEET KISSES HE SAID
NEVER LOOKS AT YOU AND WHEN DIAMOND'S OUT OF THE SHAFTS IT'S NOBODY THEN THERE'S THE MAN THAT DRINKS NEXT DOOR AND HIS WIFE AND HIS BABY THEY'RE NO FRIENDS OF MINE SAID HIS FATHER WELL THEY'RE FRIENDS OF MINE SAID DIAMOND
HE WAS PLEASED TO FIND IT SO CLEAN FOR THE STREETS WERE MUDDY AND HE HAD NICE BOOTS ON
MISSUS CRUMP AND THEN THERE'S THE CLERGYMAN THAT SPOKE TO ME IN THE GARDEN THAT DAY THE TREE WAS BLOWN DOWN WHAT'S HIS NAME I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME WHERE DOES HE LIVE I DON'T KNOW
AND THE SHADOWS BEGAN TO FLICKER AND FLEE AND THEY FLEW THROUGH THE WOOD ALL FLATTERING AND FLUTTERING OVER THE DEAD LEAVES FLICKERING AND MUTTERING AND HE SAID TO THE WIND COME FOLLOW COME FOLLOW
LEAPED FROM ITS BED AND AFTER HIM TOOK
THE MOLE OPENED HIS VERY EYES AND GLARED AND FOR RATS AND BATS AND THE WORLD AND HIS WIFE LITTLE BOY BLUE WAS AFRAID OF HIS LIFE THEN BIRDIE BROWN BEGAN TO SING AND WHAT HE SANG WAS THE VERY THING
SAID THE GENTLEMAN WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO NOT MUCH THAT I KNOW OF SAID DIAMOND
AND YOU'VE GOT NOTHING BUT A WICKED OLD GRANNIE YOU MAY HAVE MY PENNY
AS HE PUT HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET AND BROUGHT OUT A CARD THERE HE SAID YOUR FATHER WILL BE ABLE TO READ THAT AND TELL YOU WHERE TO GO YES SIR THANK YOU SIR SAID DIAMOND AND PUT THE CARD IN HIS POCKET
AND AS SOON AS OLD DIAMOND WAS SUPPERED AND BEDDED HE BEGAN THE TASK THAT VERY NIGHT BUT IT WAS NOT MUCH OF A TASK TO DIAMOND FOR HIS FATHER TOOK
AS A SIGN OF SILLINESS AND WISHED TO BE KIND TO THE POOR LITTLE FELLOW NURSE A BABY SAID DIAMOND WELL AND WHAT ELSE CLEAN FATHER'S BOOTS AND MAKE HIM A BIT OF TOAST FOR HIS TEA
BUT HAD ALWAYS FAILED TO FIND ONE MORE LIKE IT THAN ANOTHER SO HE WISELY GAVE UP THE SEARCH TILL HE COULD REALLY READ THEN HE RESOLVED TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING AND READ THEM ALL STRAIGHT THROUGH
GOD'S BABY SHE WHISPERED HE'S NOT RIGHT IN THE HEAD YOU KNOW A TILE LOOSE STILL DIAMOND THOUGH HE HEARD EVERY WORD AND UNDERSTOOD IT TOO KEPT ON SMILING WHAT COULD IT MATTER WHAT PEOPLE CALLED HIM SO LONG AS HE DID NOTHING
HIS FATHER LAUGHED AGAIN WHY CHILD YOU'RE JUST COUNTING EVERYBODY YOU KNOW THAT DON'T MAKE EM FRIENDS DON'T IT I THOUGHT IT DID WELL BUT

RETURNED DIAMOND WELL GO ON SAID HIS FATHER THEN THERE'S JACK AND MISTER STONECROP AND

THEN LITTLE BOY BLUE BEGAN TO PONDER WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH THEM ALL I WONDER THEN LITTLE BOY BLUE HE SAID QUITE LOW WHAT TO DO WITH YOU ALL I AM SURE I DON'T KNOW
EACH ON HIS OWN LITTLE HUMPY BROWN BACK HOUSEHOLDER SNAILS AND SLUGS ALL TAILS AND BUTTERFLIES FLUTTERBIES SHIPS ALL SAILS AND WEASELS AND OUSELS AND MICE AND LARKS
EXCEPT SOMEBODY PUTS ME ON HIS BACK
A LITTLE SNAKE CREPT OUT OF THE TREE APPLES AND CHERRIES ROSES AND HONEY LIE DOWN AT MY FEET LITTLE SNAKE SAID HE ALL SO JOLLY AND FUNNY A LITTLE BIRD SANG IN THE TREE OVERHEAD
SAID THE BROOK AS IT SANK AND TURNED AND RAN
CHAPTER NINETEEN DIAMOND'S FRIENDS ONE DAY WHEN OLD DIAMOND WAS STANDING WITH HIS NOSE IN HIS BAG BETWEEN PALL MALL AND COCKSPUR STREET
HE INSISTED SHOULDN'T I EVERYBODY CALLS HER WICKED OLD GRANNIE
HE'S A GOOD BOY QUITE HERE SHE TAPPED HER FOREHEAD WITH HER FINGER IN A SIGNIFICANT MANNER
WHOM DO YOU LIVE WITH HE ASKED MY WICKED OLD GRANNIE SHE REPLIED YOU SHOULDN'T CALL YOUR GRANNIE WICKED SAID THE GENTLEMAN
BUT HE HAD NEVER COME UPON THE POEM HE THOUGHT HE HAD HEARD HIS MOTHER READ FROM IT THAT DAY HE HAD LOOKED THROUGH AND THROUGH THE BOOK SEVERAL TIMES AFTER HE KNEW THE LETTERS AND A FEW WORDS FANCYING HE COULD TELL THE LOOK OF IT
WITH WHISTLE AND PIPE AND RUSTLE AND HOLLO AND THE WIND WOUND ROUND AT HIS DESIRE AS IF HE HAD BEEN THE GOLD COCK ON THE SPIRE AND THE COCK ITSELF FLEW DOWN FROM THE CHURCH
I BEGIN TO DOUBT YOU HE ROSE AND UP ROSE THE SNAKE ON ITS TAIL AND HISSED THREE TIMES HALF A HISS HALF A WAIL LITTLE BOY BLUE HE TRIED TO GO PAST HIM BUT WHEREVER HE TURNED
THE GENTLEMAN LOOKED VERY GRAVE TO HEAR HER FOR HE WAS SORRY THAT SUCH A NICE LITTLE GIRL SHOULD BE IN SUCH BAD KEEPING BUT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY NEXT
PARADISE ROW SHE ANSWERED
US SOME WORK OR ELSE WE STAY OH
APPLES AND CHERRIES ROSES AND HONEY COME AND SING YOUR SONG ON MY FINGER INSTEAD ALL SO JOLLY AND FUNNY THE SNAKE COILED UP AND THE BIRD FLEW DOWN
AND FIRST OF ALL HE STROLLED WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS UP TO THE CROSSING WHERE THE GIRL AND HER BROOM WERE TO BE FOUND IN ALL WEATHERS JUST AS HE WAS GOING TO SPEAK TO HER A TALL GENTLEMAN STEPPED UPON THE CROSSING
THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES THEN IF THEY WOULD IF I CHOOSE TO BE THEIR FRIEND YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T PREVENT ME THEN THERE'S THAT GIRL AT THE CROSSING A FINE SET OF FRIENDS YOU DO HAVE TO BE SURE DIAMOND SURELY SHE'S A FRIEND ANYHOW FATHER
THIS TOOK HIM NEARLY A FORTNIGHT WHEN HE HAD ALMOST REACHED THE END HE CAME UPON THE FOLLOWING VERSES WHICH TOOK HIS FANCY MUCH ALTHOUGH THEY WERE CERTAINLY NOT VERY LIKE THOSE HE WAS IN SEARCH OF
THE MORE THE BETTER YOU KNOW JUST LET ME COUNT SAID DIAMOND AND HE TOOK HIS HANDS FROM HIS POCKETS AND SPREADING OUT THE FINGERS OF HIS LEFT HAND BEGAN TO COUNT BEGINNING AT THE THUMB
AND EVERY CREATURE LOW DOWN BELOW HE CALLED AND THE CREATURES OBEYED THE CALL TOOK THEIR LEGS AND THEIR WINGS AND FOLLOWED HIM ALL SQUIRRELS THAT CARRIED THEIR TAILS LIKE A SACK
AND THE BOUGHS BOW DOWN AND THE APPLES THEY DAPPLE THE GRASS TOO MANY FOR HIM TO GRAPPLE AND THE CHEERIEST CHERRIES WITH NEVER A MISS FALL TO HIS MOUTH EACH A FULL GROWN KISS
AND WAVES OF SNAKE O'ER THE DAMP LEAVES PASSED AND THE SNAKE WENT FIRST AND BIRDIE BROWN LAST BY BOY BLUE'S HEAD WITH FLUTTER AND DART FLEW BIRDIE BROWN WITH ITS SONG IN ITS HEART
I KNOW BEST AND THE SUNSET CAME AND STOOD UP ON THE WOLD
AND THEN THEY ROSE UP WITH A LEAFY HISS AND STOOD AS IF NOTHING HAD BEEN AMISS LITTLE BOY BLUE SAT DOWN ON A STONE AND THE CREATURES CAME ROUND HIM EVERY ONE
SAT THE SNAKE AND FACED HIM IF YOU DON'T GET OUT OF MY WAY HE SAID I TELL YOU SNAKE I WILL BREAK YOUR HEAD
BUT WHEN SHE GAVE HIM A SWEET SMILE IN RETURN AND MADE HIM A PRETTY COURTESY HE LOOKED AT HER AGAIN AND SAID
SAID THE BROOK RUNNING FASTER I RUN THROUGH HIS GARDEN SAID THE MOLE TWO HUNDRED WORMS THERE I CAUGHT EM LAST YEAR AND I'M GOING AGAIN NEXT AUTUMN SAID THEY ALL IF THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT US TO STEER FOR
AND BECAME STILL MORE INTERESTED IN HER STILL YOU
THE GENTLEMAN WALKED AWAY BUT TURNING ROUND A FEW PACES OFF SAW DIAMOND GIVE HIS PENNY TO THE GIRL AND WALKING SLOWER HEARD HIM SAY
FLED THE SHADOWS LIKE GHOSTS IF WE STAY WE SHALL ALL BE MISSED FROM OUR POSTS SAID THE WIND WITH A VOICE THAT HAD CHANGED ITS CHEER I WAS JUST GOING THERE WHEN YOU BROUGHT ME HERE
THE DRAGON FLIES MELTED TO MIST WITH THEIR HURRYING THE MOLE IN HIS MOLESKINS LEFT HIS BARROWING BURROWING
SAID THE GIRL LOOKING UP CONFIDENTLY IN HIS FACE IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME YOU CAN COME AND TAKE A LOOK AT HER THE WORDS SOUNDED RUDE BUT THE GIRL'S FACE LOOKED SO SIMPLE THAT THE GENTLEMAN SAW SHE DID NOT MEAN TO BE RUDE
AND HE SAID TO THE CLOUDS I WANT YOU THERE AND DOWN THEY SANK THROUGH THE THIN BLUE AIR AND HE SAID TO THE SUNSET FAR IN THE WEST COME HERE I WANT YOU
WERE TOO FAST IN THEIR BOOTS AFTER HIM LEANING AND STRAINING AND BENDING AS ON THROUGH THEIR BOLES HE KEPT WALKING AND WENDING TILL OUT OF THE WOOD HE BURST ON A LEA
PLEASE SIR SAID DIAMOND HER GRANNIE'S VERY CRUEL TO HER SOMETIMES AND SHUTS HER OUT IN THE STREETS AT NIGHT IF SHE HAPPENS TO BE LATE IS THIS YOUR BROTHER ASKED THE GENTLEMAN OF THE GIRL NO SIR
THE SNAKE SNEAKED CLOSE ROUND BIRDIE BROWN FLEW THE BROOK SAT UP LIKE A SNAKE ON ITS TAIL AND THE WIND CAME UP WITH A WHAT WILL YOU WAIL
HIS FATHER LAUGHED MUCH GOOD THEY'LL DO YOU HE SAID
AND SANG HIM THE SONG OF BIRDIE BROWN LITTLE BOY BLUE FOUND IT TIRESOME TO SIT AND HE THOUGHT HE HAD BETTER WALK ON A BIT SO UP HE GOT HIS WAY TO TAKE AND HE SAID COME ALONG LITTLE BIRD AND SNAKE
FOR HIS LESSON BOOK THOSE VERY RHYMES HIS MOTHER HAD PICKED UP ON THE SEA SHORE AND AS DIAMOND WAS NOT BEGINNING TOO SOON HE LEARNED VERY FAST INDEED WITHIN A MONTH HE WAS ABLE TO SPELL OUT MOST OF THE VERSES FOR HIMSELF

THAN THEY ARE AT PRESENT IN THIS FREE COUNTRY HOW DOES THIS MOST ANCIENT APOLOGUE APPLY TO THE SUBJECT IN HAND THE DINNER GIVING SNOB THE IMITATION OF THE GREAT IS UNIVERSAL IN THIS CITY FROM THE PALACES OF KENSINGTONIA
THE DOCTOR'S WIFE IS SULKY BECAUSE SHE HAS NOT BEEN LED OUT BEFORE THE BARRISTER'S LADY OLD DOCTOR CORK IS GRUMBLING AT THE WINE AND GUTTLETON SNEERING AT THE COOKERY AND TO THINK THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE MIGHT BE SO HAPPY
MUCH ENDURING YOUTHFUL HUMAN SOULS SHOULD BE THE SPORT OF WHAT SEEMS TO HIM
AND OH OH GRANNIE CRIED THE CHILD IN A SAD FRIGHT
BUT IF THEN YOU FAIL TO ANSWER ME YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR HEAD AND ALL YOUR LANDS SHALL BE MINE THE ABBOT WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND IN GREAT FEAR HE FIRST RODE TO OXFORD HERE WAS A GREAT SCHOOL
IF YOU FAIL TO ANSWER MY THREE QUESTIONS YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR HEAD I AM READY TO ANSWER THEM O KING SAID THE SHEPHERD INDEED INDEED SAID THE KING AND HE LAUGHED TO HIMSELF WELL THEN
SECRETLY IT MAY BE FOR OFTEN THE GIRL NEVERTHELESS DEVOTEDLY AND ONLY UNDER COMPULSION WILL HE LISTEN TO THE DETRACTOR HE MAY DESERT HER OR IF HE STICKS TO HER HE MAY BEAT HER NO MATTER HE HOLDS HER HEART

LITTLE INSCRIPTION TO MY WIFE MISSUS SNOB AND A HALF SCORE OF SILVER TANKARDS FOR THE LITTLE SNOBLINGS TO GLITTER ON THE HOMELY TABLE WHERE THEY PARTAKE OF THEIR QUOTIDIAN MUTTON IF I HAD MY WAY
AND SET OFF DOWN THE SUNNY GREEN SLOPE WITH HER BASKET IN HER HAND AT A BRISK PACE BUT AS SHE GOT DEEPER INTO THE FOREST SHE WALKED MORE SLOWLY EVERYTHING WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THE GREAT TREES WAVED THEIR HUGE ARMS OVER HER
FLIRTATIONS LIKE CLANDESTINE ENGAGEMENTS ARE AN AFFRONT TO LOVE
DINNER GIVING SNOBS FURTHER CONSIDERED IF MY FRIENDS WOULD BUT FOLLOW THE PRESENT PREVAILING FASHION I THINK THEY OUGHT TO GIVE ME A TESTIMONIAL FOR THE PAPER ON DINNER GIVING SNOBS WHICH I AM NOW WRITING
AND SEE THE MYRIADS WHO ARE NOT SO FORTUNATE TO WEAR HONEST LINEN WHILE MAGNIFICOS OF THE WORLD ARE ADORNED WITH CAMBRIC AND POINT LACE SURELY WE OUGHT TO HOLD AS MISERABLE ENVIOUS FOOLS
ALWAYS THE GIRL KNOWS WHETHER THE PLAY IS LEADING SHE PROBABLY CHOOSES THE GAME VERY LATE IN LIFE DOES A MAN LEARN THE TRUTH AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT ANCIENT PROVERB THAT KISSING GOES BY FAVOUR FOR
WAS AT THE TIME WHEN ALL THE BIRDS AND BEASTS OR VERY NEARLY ALL COULD SPEAK JUST AS WELL AS YOU OR I AND NOBODY WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THEM TALK AS I SUPPOSE ONE WOULD BE NOWADAYS WELL
THEN THE WOLF STRETCHED OUT HIS LARGE HAIRY PAWS AND BEGAN TO UNFASTEN THE BASKET OH SAID RED RIDING HOOD WHAT GREAT ARMS YOU HAVE GRANNIE
THE TURN COMES AT THE VERY END BUT IN BOTH CASES THE TIME TAKEN BY THE EMBELLISHMENT IS TAKEN FROM THE TIME VALUE OF THE PRINCIPAL NOTE FOR FURTHER DETAILS
LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD IN A GREAT WIDE FOREST FULL OF BEAUTIFUL TREES AND GREEN GLADES AND THORNY THICKETS THERE LIVED A LONG TIME AGO A WOOD CUTTER AND HIS WIFE
FATE HAS COMFORTABLY APPOINTED GOLD PLATE FOR SOME AND HAS BIDDEN OTHERS CONTENTEDLY TO WEAR THE WILLOW PATTERN AND BEING PERFECTLY CONTENTED INDEED HUMBLY THANKFUL FOR LOOK AROUND O JONES
THROUGH THE COPSE AND DOWN THE HOLLOW AND OVER THE BRIDGE AND THREE MEADOWS AFTER THE MILL
SHE IS A THIRD SORT OF THING WHEN SHE IS WITH A MAN BUT THIS BAFFLED EVEN AGUR THE SON OF JAKEH AS A RULE A MAN PREFERS A GIRL BY HERSELF THIS IS NATURAL
FOR WHERE TWO CROSS PATHS DIVIDED THERE SAT A BIG GRAY WOLF LICKING HIS LONG PAWS AND LOOKING SHARPLY ABOUT HIM AND GOOD MORNING RED RIDING HOOD SAID HE GOOD MORNING MISTER WOLF SHE ANSWERED
CHAPTER SIX EMBELLISHMENTS SIXTY FOUR EMBELLISHMENTS OR GRACES
ICES SWEETS CHAMPAGNE DRIVES CHURCH GOINGS AND SOMETIMES SPOT CASH MEN ARE ALWAYS WISHING THEY KNEW ALL ABOUT GIRLS IT IS A PRECIOUS GOOD THING THAT THEY DON'T
AGREMENTS ARE ORNAMENTAL TONES EITHER REPRESENTED IN FULL IN THE SCORE OR INDICATED BY CERTAIN SIGNS THE FOLLOWING ARE THE EMBELLISHMENTS MOST COMMONLY FOUND TRILL OR SHAKE MORDENT
AND ENTERTAIN EACH OTHER TO THE RUIN OF FRIENDSHIP LET ALONE HEALTH AND THE DESTRUCTION OF HOSPITALITY AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP YOU WHO BUT FOR THE PEACOCK'S TAIL MIGHT CHATTER AWAY SO MUCH AT YOUR EASE AND BE SO JOVIAL AND HAPPY
AS SOME ONE OUGHT TO HAVE SAID ARE EXCELLENT THINGS IN WOMAN OTHER MEN EQUALLY FOOLISH HAVE REGARDED GIRLS AS PLAYTHINGS I WISH THESE MEN HAD TRIED TO PLAY WITH THEM THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT THEY WERE PLAYING WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE
WITH ITALIAN COLORATURA SINGING
WHO REFLECTS THAT SHE HAS NEVER BEEN THERE THE WIDOW IS VEXED OUT OF PATIENCE BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER MARIA HAS GOT A PLACE BESIDE YOUNG CAMBRIC THE PENNILESS CURATE AND NOT BY COLONEL GOLDMORE THE RICH WIDOWER FROM INDIA
THE SERVANTS ARE NOT SERVANTS BUT THE BEFORE MENTIONED RETAIL TRADESMEN THE PLATE IS NOT PLATE BUT A MERE SHINY BIRMINGHAM LACQUER AND SO IS THE HOSPITALITY AND EVERYTHING ELSE THE TALK IS BIRMINGHAM TALK THE WAG OF THE PARTY
WHY THEN I DO BELIEVE SHE IS A VERY DEAR OLD FRIEND OF MINE WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN FOR YEARS AND YEARS NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO YOU AND I I WILL GO BY THIS WAY AND YOU SHALL TAKE THAT AND WHOEVER GETS THERE FIRST
A WOMAN THINKS SHE DETECTS SERIOUSNESS IN FLIPPANCY WHAT WOULD BE CONDUCT DECIDEDLY RISQUE IN A CITY MISS IS OFTEN INNOCENT PLAYFULNESS IN A COUNTRY MAID
IS SHE ABUNDANTLY ENDOWED WITH THE VERY ATTRIBUTES THAT MAKE FOR WIFE AND MOTHER HOOD A STRONG AND SWAYING PASSION AND AN AFFECTION UNBOUNDED SHE MUST HOLD THEM IN LEASH WITH EXEMPLARY PATIENCE FOR ALAS
WHEN THEY ASK US TO DINE IF IT BE PLEASANT TO DINE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AS ALL PERSONS WITH GOOD STOMACHS AND KINDLY HEARTS WILL I PRESUME ALLOW IT TO BE IT IS BETTER TO DINE TWICE THAN TO DINE ONCE
THAN THEY ARE OF ONE ANOTHER WHICH IS VERY LUCKY FOR THE MEN GIRLS DIFFER AND THE SAME GIRL IS DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN SHE IS BY HERSELF SHE IS ONE THING WHEN SHE IS WITH OTHER GIRLS SHE IS ANOTHER THING WHEN SHE IS WITH A LOT OF MEN
THE MASCULINE MIND IS THE SLAVE OF LAW AND JUSTICE APHRODITE NEVER HEARD OF LAW OR JUSTICE SHE WAS BORN AT SEA THAT IS TO SAY FEW ARE THE MEN WHO AT SOME TIME IN THEIR LIVES HAVE NOT WONDERED AT THE VAGARIES
THAT A FOOL MAY TEACH A WISE MAN WIT I THINK I CAN HELP YOU OUT OF YOUR TROUBLE YOU HELP ME CRIED THE ABBOT HOW HOW WELL ANSWERED THE SHEPHERD YOU KNOW THAT EVERYBODY SAYS
SINCE EVEN IF A CLANDESTINE ENGAGEMENT AS IS USUALLY THE CASE IS MERELY A FLIRTATION WITH THE EMOLUMENTS
AND TO FLAUNT HIS MAGNIFICENT FAN TAIL IN THE SUNSHINE THE JAYS WITH PEACOCKS FEATHERS ARE THE SNOBS OF THIS WORLD AND NEVER SINCE THE DAYS OF AESOP WERE THEY MORE NUMEROUS IN ANY LAND
AND THE BIRDS WOULD SEEM TO SING MORE SWEETLY WHEN SHE WAS PASSING BY HER REAL NAME WAS MAISIE BUT THE NEIGHBORS ROUND ABOUT ALL CALLED HER LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
WOULD GO INTO HER WORK BOX THE LITTLEST GIRL IS A LITTLE WOMEN NO BOY KNOWS THIS AND PRECIOUS FEW GROWN UP MEN THUS MANY A GROWN UP MAN PLAYS WITH A GIRL THEN FINDS HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER AS TO THE GIRL
AND I AM TO SEE HOW SHE IS AND TELL MOTHER WHEN I GET BACK SAID THE CHILD WITH A SMILE AND SAID THE WOLF
SHE MAKES BELIEVE TO BE CAPTURED
HATEFUL AS DISSEMBLANCE IN MEN T'IS A HARD ROAD INDEED THAT A GIRL HAS TO TRAVEL TO WIN HER A FELLOW FARER FOR LIFE SHE MUST GO OUT OF HER WAY TO ACCOMMODATE SO MANY TRAVELERS AND THIS ONE IS LURED BY THIS AND THAT ONE BY THAT
ARE NOT NICE THINGS FOR A SUBSEQUENT AND AVOWED LOVER WHETHER MASCULINE OR FEMININE TO THINK UPON LASTLY A LAXITY WITH REGARD TO THE CLAIMS OF COURTSHIP IS APT TO BREED A LAXITY WITH REGARD TO THE CLAIMS OF WEDLOCK IN SHORT
WHICH MAKES THEM MORE SOMETHING OR OTHERISH STILL THERE IS NO OTHER WORD FOR IT A GIRL IS A COMPLICATED THING IT IS MADE UP OF CLOTHES SMILES A POMPADOUR THINGS OF WHICH SPACE AND PRUDENCE FORBID THE ENUMERATION HERE
TO PROVE HERSELF WHOLE HEARTED FOR OF COURSE ALWAYS EVERY SUITOR EXPECTS WHOLE HEARTEDNESS AND THIS EVERY GIRL INSTINCTIVELY KNOWS INDEED IS NOT A HALF HEARTED LOVE OR A HALF HEARTED ACCEPTRESS OF LOVE A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS
ANSWER MY FIRST QUESTION HOW LONG SHALL I LIVE COME YOU MUST TELL ME TO THE VERY DAY YOU SHALL LIVE SAID THE SHEPHERD UNTIL THE DAY THAT YOU DIE AND NOT ONE DAY LONGER AND YOU SHALL DIE WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR LAST BREATH
AND BELGRAVIA EVEN TO THE REMOTEST CORNER OF BRUNSWICK SQUARE PEACOCKS FEATHERS ARE STUCK IN THE TAILS OF MOST FAMILIES SCARCE ONE OF US DOMESTIC BIRDS BUT IMITATES THE LANKY
IS ALWAYS ACCENTED BUT THE ACCIACCATURA NEVER IS THE STRESS ALWAYS FALLING ON THE MELODY TONE SEE GROVE
BUT THIS IS A THORNY SUBJECT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT ALL MEN LOVE ALL GIRLS THE MAID OF SWEET SIXTEEN EQUALLY WITH THE MAID OF UNTOLD AGE THERE IS SOMETHING EXASPERATINGLY SOMETHING OR OTHERISH ABOUT GIRLS AND THEY KNOW IT
AND MY PLANS COULD BE CARRIED OUT DINNER GIVING WOULD INCREASE AS MUCH ON THE ONE HAND AS DINNER GIVING SNOBBISHNESS WOULD DIMINISH TO MY MIND THE MOST AMIABLE PART OF THE WORK LATELY PUBLISHED BY MY ESTEEMED FRIEND
ALL WHITE WITH BLOSSOM AND THE CHILD BEGAN SINGING AS SHE WENT SHE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHY BUT I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD MADE HER FEEL GLAD THE PATH WOUND ALONG THROUGH THE TREES AND AS IT GREW WIDER AFTER TURNING A CORNER
WHOM YOU HAVE THE HONOUR OF KNOWING IF SUCH BE NOT THE CASE I AM FAR FROM WISHING THAT THEIR GRACES SHOULD TREAT ME IN A SIMILAR FASHION SPLENDOUR IS A PART OF THEIR STATION AS DECENT COMFORT LET US TRUST OF YOURS AND MINE
SO LEND ME YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR HORSE AND YOUR GOWN AND I WILL GO UP TO LONDON AND SEE THE KING IF NOTHING ELSE CAN BE DONE I CAN AT LEAST DIE IN YOUR PLACE
WAITED UPON HIM AT HIS TABLE WHEN KING JOHN HEARD OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE ABBOT LIVED HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO PUT A STOP TO IT SO HE SENT FOR THE OLD MAN TO COME AND SEE HIM HOW NOW MY GOOD ABBOT
AS I WAS SAYING LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD LIVED WITH HER PARENTS IN A LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE WITH A GREEN DOOR AND A THATCHED ROOF AND RED AND WHITE ROSES CLIMBING ALL OVER THE WALLS
AND TO INDICATE SOME OF THE RESULTS WHICH MIGHT FOLLOW UPON ITS HEALTHY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO POINT OUT THAT EACH OF THESE SUBJECTS NEEDS AT LEAST A VOLUME TO ITSELF
I WISH I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT FROM AUNT SHAW I ONLY KNEW HE COULD NOT COME BACK TO ENGLAND BECAUSE OF THAT TERRIBLE AFFAIR POOR DEAR PAPA HOW SAD HE LOOKS
NO CONDITIONS BEING ATTACHED TO THIS APPOINTMENT IT SEEMED A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SO FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MOMENT SOME OF THE IMPLICITS WHICH I BELIEVE TO UNDERLIE HUMAN EFFORT
TOO CROWDED THAT IS THE WORST
OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY
CHAPTER TWO ROSES AND THORNS BY THE SOFT GREEN LIGHT IN THE WOODY GLADE ON THE BANKS OF MOSS WHERE THY CHILDHOOD PLAYED BY THE HOUSEHOLD TREE
ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
A SIGNAL WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD OFTEN TO BE REPEATED BEFORE ANY ONE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO THE HOUR OF THE DAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS AND ATTEND TO HIM NOW MISTER HALE LOITERED ABOUT THE GARDEN IF THE MORNING WAS FINE AND IF NOT
LEARNED AND DELIGHTED IN USING THEIR PECULIAR WORDS TOOK UP HER FREEDOM AMONGST THEM NURSED THEIR BABIES TALKED OR READ WITH SLOW DISTINCTNESS TO THEIR OLD PEOPLE
THE RELATION IN WHICH INSTITUTIONAL RELIGION DOES OR SHOULD STAND TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE IS ALSO IN PART A MATTER FOR PSYCHOLOGY WHICH IS HERE CALLED UPON TO DEAL WITH THE RELIGIOUS ASPECT OF THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
WERE BY FAR THE LIGHTEST NEWEST AND MOST AMUSING THE BOOK SHELVES DID NOT AFFORD MUCH RESOURCE MARGARET TOLD HER MOTHER EVERY PARTICULAR OF HER LONDON LIFE TO ALL OF WHICH MISSUS HALE LISTENED WITH INTEREST
I CALL MINE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE TASTE I LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHOSE OCCUPATIONS HAVE TO DO WITH LAND I LIKE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND THE THREE LEARNED PROFESSIONS AS THEY CALL THEM
EVERY IMPROVEMENT OF MACHINERY IS I BELIEVE TO BE SEEN THERE IN ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T LIKE MILLS AND MANUFACTORIES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS SAID FANNY IN A HALF WHISPER
MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN SOME COTTAGE IN THE GREEN SHADE OF THE FOREST HER OUT OF DOORS LIFE WAS PERFECT HER IN DOORS LIFE HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
A WHITE CHIP BONNET OH DOZENS OF THINGS FOR THE WEDDING AND HUNDREDS OF THINGS FOR THE HOUSE MARGARET ONLY KNEW THAT HER MOTHER HAD NOT FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO COME
MISSUS THORNTON DID NOT SPEAK BUT SHE LAID HER WORK ON THE TABLE AND SEEMED TO THINK IT WILL BE A LONG WAY FOR HER TO WALK BACK AT NIGHT
NO ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOSE ABNORMAL EXPERIENCES AND STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH TOO OFTEN REGARDED AS SPECIALLY MYSTICAL ARE NOW RECOGNIZED BY ALL COMPETENT STUDENTS AS REPRESENTING THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS
HE WENT ABRUPTLY OUT OF THE ROOM AFTER SAYING THIS IF HE HAD STAID A MINUTE LONGER FANNY WOULD HAVE CRIED AT HIS TONE OF COMMAND EVEN WHEN HE USED THE WORDS YOU WILL OBLIGE ME
IF MISSUS SHAW HAD GUESSED AT THE REAL REASON WHY MISSUS HALE DID NOT ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWERED DOWN GOWNS UPON HER BUT IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE MISSUS SHAW HAD BEEN THE POOR PRETTY MISS BERESFORD
MARGARET'S MANNER HAD AN EXTRA TINGE OF COLDNESS IN IT WHEN SHE NEXT SPOKE YOU HAVE GOOD CONCERTS HERE I BELIEVE
WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
MISSUS THORNTON WAS NOT A WOMAN MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING HER QUICK JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION SERVED HER IN GOOD STEAD OF ANY LONG ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH HERSELF SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT NOTHING COULD STRENGTHEN FANNY TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS PATIENTLY
NOT ABSOLUTELY BASED ON A KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS IS EASILY BANISHED FOR A TIME BY A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY OR SOME HAPPY OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHEN THE BRILLIANT FOURTEEN FINE DAYS OF OCTOBER CAME ON
BUT EVERY DAY HE WAS MORE OVERPOWERED THE WORLD BECAME MORE BEWILDERING AT EACH REPEATED URGENCY OF HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD PUT HIMSELF IN THE WAY OF SEEKING SOME PREFERMENT
AND HAD DISCOURAGED HER HUSBAND VERY EARLY IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE IN HIS DESIRE OF READING ALOUD TO HER WHILE SHE WORKED AT ONE TIME THEY HAD TRIED BACKGAMMON AS A RESOURCE BUT AS MISTER HALE GREW TO TAKE AN INCREASING INTEREST IN HIS SCHOOL AND HIS PARISHIONERS
ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES MISTER HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
BUT HER HEART GAVE THANKS FOR HIM DAY AND NIGHT AND SHE WALKED PROUDLY AMONG WOMEN FOR HIS SAKE FANNY DEAR I SHALL HAVE HORSES TO THE CARRIAGE TO DAY TO GO AND CALL ON THESE HALES
HIS ROOM WAS KEPT EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT IT AND WAS REGULARLY DUSTED AND PUT INTO ORDER BY DIXON MISSUS HALE'S MAID WHO TOUCHED NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK
THE FULL ACCOUNT OF WHICH MARGARET HAD NEVER HEARD AND WHICH NOW SEEMED DOOMED TO BE BURIED IN SAD OBLIVION
BUT ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY LADY BERESFORD AS LADIES MAID TO SIR JOHN'S WARDS THE PRETTY MISS BERESFORDS THE BELLES OF RUTLANDSHIRE
THE SCHOOL AND THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES THIS DID GOOD FOR A TIME BUT WHEN THE AUTUMN DREW ON AND THE WEATHER BECAME MORE CHANGEABLE HER MOTHER'S IDEA OF THE UNHEALTHINESS OF THE PLACE INCREASED
THAN THE SERENE CALM OF THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE WHO LED A PLACID CONTENTED LIFE MARGARET WAS PAINFULLY STRUCK BY THE WORN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION AND SHE WENT BACK OVER THE OPEN AND AVOWED CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER FATHER'S LIFE
SHE HAD LEARNT DRAWING WITH EDITH AND SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY REGRETTED DURING THE GLOOM OF THE BAD WEATHER HER IDLE REVELLING IN THE BEAUTY OF THE WOODLANDS WHILE IT HAD YET BEEN FINE TO MAKE HER DETERMINED TO SKETCH WHAT SHE COULD
AT THIS POINT MISTER THORNTON CAME IN JUST BEFORE GOING TO THE MILL MOTHER I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT IF THERE IS ANY LITTLE THING THAT COULD SERVE MISSUS HALE AS AN INVALID YOU WILL OFFER IT I'M SURE IF I CAN FIND IT OUT I WILL
BUT SO MUCH THE MORE I HAVE TO WATCH OVER YOU NOW AS FOR FANNY THERE A LITTLE HARDSHIP WOULD DO HER GOOD SHE IS NOT MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AS YOU ARE JOHN SHE COULD NOT BEAR IT
TOO PLAINLY FOR BEAUTY IF HIS FEATURES HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT AS IT WAS THEY HAD A GRACE IF NOT A COMELINESS OF THEIR OWN THE FACE WAS IN REPOSE BUT IT WAS RATHER REST AFTER WEARINESS
WAS OF AN IVORY SMOOTHNESS AND DELICACY IF THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS IN GENERAL TOO DIGNIFIED AND RESERVED FOR ONE SO YOUNG NOW TALKING TO HER FATHER IT WAS BRIGHT AS THE MORNING
THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP MANY LUXURIES WHICH HAD ONLY BEEN TROUBLES AND TRAMMELS TO HER FREEDOM IN HARLEY STREET HER KEEN ENJOYMENT OF EVERY SENSUOUS PLEASURE WAS BALANCED FINELY IF NOT OVERBALANCED
FULL OF DIMPLES AND GLANCES THAT SPOKE OF CHILDISH GLADNESS AND BOUNDLESS HOPE IN THE FUTURE IT WAS THE LATTER PART OF JULY WHEN MARGARET RETURNED HOME THE FOREST TREES WERE ALL ONE DARK FULL DUSKY GREEN
TO FIND THE CAUSE FOR THE LINES THAT SPOKE SO PLAINLY OF HABITUAL DISTRESS AND DEPRESSION POOR FREDERICK THOUGHT SHE SIGHING OH IF FREDERICK HAD BUT BEEN A CLERGYMAN INSTEAD OF GOING INTO THE NAVY AND BEING LOST TO US ALL
HER MOTHER HAD BEEN DETAINED AT HOME BY A MULTITUDE OF HALF REASONS NONE OF WHICH ANYBODY FULLY UNDERSTOOD EXCEPT MISTER HALE WHO WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT ALL HIS ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF A GREY SATIN GOWN
MISSUS HALE WAS MAKING RATHER MORE EXERTION IN HER ANSWERS CAPTIVATED BY SOME REAL OLD LACE WHICH MISSUS THORNTON WORE LACE AS SHE AFTERWARDS OBSERVED TO DIXON OF THAT OLD ENGLISH POINT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MADE FOR THIS SEVENTY YEARS AND
WHO MIGHT NOW PUT THEMSELVES TO TROUBLE AND EXPENSE IN THEIR TURN YET CRAMPTON WAS TOO FAR OFF FOR HER TO WALK AND SHE HAD REPEATEDLY QUESTIONED HER SON AS TO WHETHER HIS WISH THAT SHE SHOULD CALL ON THE HALES WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR THE EXPENSE OF CAB HIRE
SO HE WITHDREW WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE YET YOUNG INTO HIS LIBRARY TO SPEND HIS EVENINGS IF HE WERE AT HOME IN READING THE SPECULATIVE AND METAPHYSICAL BOOKS WHICH WERE HIS DELIGHT
WHICH CANNOT BE BOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN HEIR LOOM AND SHOWS THAT SHE HAD ANCESTORS SO THE OWNER OF THE ANCESTRAL LACE BECAME WORTHY OF SOMETHING MORE THAN THE LANGUID EXERTION TO BE AGREEABLE TO A VISITOR
THIS BOOK OWES ITS ORIGIN TO THE FACT THAT IN THE AUTUMN OF NINETEEN TWENTY ONE THE AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE OXFORD INVITED ME TO DELIVER THE INAUGURAL COURSE OF A LECTURESHIP IN RELIGION NEWLY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE WILL OF THE LATE PROFESSOR UPTON
MISSUS HALE IF SHE SPOKE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED WITH A READY MADE LIST
BUT THE LITTLE ALTERCATION BETWEEN HER SON AND HER DAUGHTER DID NOT INCLINE MISSUS THORNTON MORE FAVOURABLY TOWARDS THESE HALES HER JEALOUS HEART REPEATED HER DAUGHTER'S QUESTION
THE OPPRESSION OF WHICH COULD NOT BE RELIEVED BY ANY DAILY ACTION SUCH AS COMFORTING THE SURVIVORS OR TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL IN HOPE OF LESSENING THE EVILS IN THE GENERATION TO COME MISTER HALE DID NOT GO OUT AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS AS MUCH AS USUAL
MISSUS THORNTON WAS SHY IT WAS ONLY OF LATE YEARS THAT SHE HAD HAD LEISURE ENOUGH IN HER LIFE TO GO INTO SOCIETY AND AS SOCIETY SHE DID NOT ENJOY IT
HER DEAR FATHER LEANING BACK ASLEEP IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE HIS BLUE BLACK HAIR WAS GREY NOW AND LAY THINLY OVER HIS BROWS THE BONES OF HIS FACE WERE PLAINLY TO BE SEEN
NOW THERE WERE ONLY THE WELL BOUND LITTLE READ ENGLISH CLASSICS WHICH WERE WEEDED OUT OF HER FATHER'S LIBRARY TO FILL UP THE SMALL BOOK SHELVES IN THE DRAWING ROOM THOMSON'S SEASONS HAYLEY'S COWPER MIDDLETON'S CICERO
BUT SURELY IT IS A VERY EASY JOURNEY TO LONDON YES BUT SOMEHOW SAID FANNY LOWERING HER VOICE MAMMA HAS NEVER BEEN TO LONDON HERSELF AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY LONGING
WHICH THE UNEASY TENDERNESS OF MISSUS THORNTON'S MANNER TO HER DAUGHTER THE SHAME WITH WHICH SHE THOUGHT TO HIDE THE POVERTY OF HER CHILD IN ALL THE GRAND QUALITIES WHICH SHE HERSELF POSSESSED UNCONSCIOUSLY AND WHICH SHE SET SO HIGH A VALUE UPON IN OTHERS
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE OUT IN A CAB YOU CAME HOME WITH A HEADACHE FROM THE JOLTING I NEVER COMPLAINED OF IT I'M SURE NO
WITH WHAT ASKED MISSUS THORNTON HER BROW SLIGHTLY CONTRACTING
AND SHE HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN ALL GRIEVANCES EXCEPT THAT OF THE UNHAPPINESS ARISING FROM DISPARITY OF AGE IN MARRIED LIFE ON WHICH SHE COULD DESCANT BY THE HALF HOUR DEAREST MARIA HAD MARRIED THE MAN OF HER HEART
THEY CARRIED THE DEAD BODIES OUT AND PROPPED THEM UP AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN THE GATEHOUSE ULYSSES ORDERED THEM ABOUT AND MADE THEM DO THEIR WORK QUICKLY SO THEY HAD TO CARRY THE BODIES OUT
THERE IS NOT A MAN OF US ALL WHO IS SUCH ANOTHER AS ULYSSES FOR I HAVE SEEN HIM AND REMEMBER HIM THOUGH I WAS THEN ONLY A CHILD
EVEN SO DID ULYSSES AND HIS MEN FALL UPON THE SUITORS AND SMITE THEM ON EVERY SIDE THEY MADE A HORRIBLE GROANING AS THEIR BRAINS WERE BEING BATTERED IN AND THE GROUND SEETHED WITH THEIR BLOOD
BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO STRING THE BOW AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON
WHEN HE HAD TAKEN AIM HE LET FLY AND HIS ARROW PIERCED EVERY ONE OF THE HANDLE HOLES OF THE AXES FROM THE FIRST ONWARDS TILL IT HAD GONE RIGHT THROUGH THEM AND INTO THE OUTER COURTYARD THEN HE SAID TO TELEMACHUS
THIS IS WHAT WILL BE SAID AND IT WILL BE A SCANDAL AGAINST US EURYMACHUS PENELOPE ANSWERED PEOPLE WHO PERSIST IN EATING UP THE ESTATE OF A GREAT CHIEFTAIN
AND ALSO ALL THE MAIDSERVANTS THAT ARE IN THE HOUSE ALL THAT YOU HAVE SAID IS TRUE
MAKE TRIAL OF THE BOW AND GET THIS CONTEST SETTLED ON THIS HE PUT THE BOW DOWN LETTING IT LEAN AGAINST THE DOOR THAT LED INTO THE HOUSE WITH THE ARROW STANDING AGAINST THE TOP OF THE BOW
BUT LET US SEE WHETHER YOU CAN STRING THE BOW OR NO I TOO WILL MAKE TRIAL OF IT FOR IF I CAN STRING IT AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON I SHALL NOT SUFFER MY MOTHER TO QUIT THIS HOUSE WITH A STRANGER
WHILE THE POINTED SHAFT OF ANOTHER STRUCK THE WALL STILL AMPHIMEDON JUST TOOK A PIECE OF THE TOP SKIN FROM OFF TELEMACHUS'S WRIST
BUT HE FOUND THEM ALL LYING IN THE DUST AND WELTERING IN THEIR BLOOD THEY WERE LIKE FISHES WHICH FISHERMEN HAVE NETTED OUT OF THE SEA AND THROWN UPON THE BEACH TO LIE GASPING FOR WATER
MY FRIENDS HE WILL SOON HAVE TO LEAVE OFF FOR MENTOR HAS GONE AWAY AFTER HAVING DONE NOTHING FOR HIM BUT BRAG THEY ARE STANDING AT THE DOORS UNSUPPORTED DO NOT AIM AT HIM ALL AT ONCE
THAT ARE OVER AGAINST ELIS WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO LET ANY ONE HAVE THE BOW OR TO REFUSE IT NO ONE SHALL FORCE ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER NOT EVEN THOUGH I CHOOSE TO MAKE THE STRANGER A PRESENT OF THE BOW OUTRIGHT AND LET HIM TAKE IT AWAY WITH HIM
I SHALL DIE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT AND SHALL HAVE GOT NO THANKS FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT I DID ULYSSES LOOKED STERNLY AT HIM AND ANSWERED IF YOU WERE THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST YOU MUST HAVE PRAYED MANY A TIME
YOUR GUEST HAS NOT DISGRACED YOU TELEMACHUS I DID NOT MISS WHAT I AIMED AT AND I WAS NOT LONG IN STRINGING MY BOW I AM STILL STRONG AND NOT AS THE SUITORS TWIT ME WITH BEING NOW HOWEVER
THEN TELEMACHUS SPOKE GREAT HEAVENS HE EXCLAIMED JOVE MUST HAVE ROBBED ME OF MY SENSES HERE IS MY DEAR AND EXCELLENT MOTHER SAYING SHE WILL QUIT THIS HOUSE AND MARRY AGAIN
TILL THE HEAT OF THE SUN MAKES AN END OF THEM EVEN SO WERE THE SUITORS LYING ALL HUDDLED UP ONE AGAINST THE OTHER THEN ULYSSES SAID TO TELEMACHUS
YOU SHALL SEE NO OTHER CONTEST YOU ARE A DOOMED MAN HE WHOM YOU HAVE SLAIN WAS THE FOREMOST YOUTH IN ITHACA AND THE VULTURES SHALL DEVOUR YOU FOR HAVING KILLED HIM
STAY YOUR HAND THEREFORE AND TELL YOUR FATHER OR HE WILL KILL ME IN HIS RAGE AGAINST THE SUITORS FOR HAVING WASTED HIS SUBSTANCE AND BEEN SO FOOLISHLY DISRESPECTFUL TO YOURSELF ULYSSES SMILED AT HIM AND ANSWERED
I THINK I WILL SAY IT WHAT MANNER OF MEN WOULD YOU BE TO STAND BY ULYSSES IF SOME GOD SHOULD BRING HIM BACK HERE ALL OF A SUDDEN SAY WHICH YOU ARE DISPOSED TO DO TO SIDE WITH THE SUITORS
TO MAKE THE SUITORS TRY THEIR SKILL WITH THE BOW AND WITH THE IRON AXES IN CONTEST AMONG THEMSELVES AS A MEANS OF BRINGING ABOUT THEIR DESTRUCTION SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND GOT THE STORE ROOM KEY WHICH WAS MADE OF BRONZE AND HAD A HANDLE OF IVORY
OR YOUNG AS I AM I WILL PELT YOU WITH STONES BACK TO THE COUNTRY FOR I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO I WISH I WAS AS MUCH STRONGER THAN ALL THE OTHER SUITORS IN THE HOUSE AS I AM THAN YOU
IF SOME GOD WERE BUT TO BRING ULYSSES BACK YOU SHOULD SEE WITH WHAT MIGHT AND MAIN I WOULD FIGHT FOR HIM IN LIKE WORDS EUMAEUS PRAYED TO ALL THE GODS THAT ULYSSES MIGHT RETURN WHEN THEREFORE
HE SAW FOR CERTAIN WHAT MIND THEY WERE OF ULYSSES SAID IT IS I ULYSSES WHO AM HERE I HAVE SUFFERED MUCH BUT AT LAST IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR I AM COME BACK TO MY OWN COUNTRY
THAN THAT YOU WANT TO MARRY ME THIS THEN BEING THE PRIZE THAT YOU ARE CONTENDING FOR I WILL BRING OUT THE MIGHTY BOW OF ULYSSES AND WHOMSOEVER OF YOU SHALL STRING IT MOST EASILY
THOUGH HE HAD HOPED TO STRING THE BOW AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON HE WAS TRYING FOR THE FOURTH TIME AND WOULD HAVE STRUNG IT HAD NOT ULYSSES MADE A SIGN TO CHECK HIM IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EAGERNESS SO HE SAID ALAS
BENEATH WHICH HE HAD HIDDEN BY COVERING HIMSELF UP WITH A FRESHLY FLAYED HEIFER'S HIDE SO HE THREW OFF THE HIDE WENT UP TO TELEMACHUS AND LAID HOLD OF HIS KNEES HERE I AM MY DEAR SIR SAID HE
HELP WOULD COME AT ONCE AND WE SHOULD SOON MAKE AN END OF THIS MAN AND HIS SHOOTING THIS MAY NOT BE AGELAUS ANSWERED MELANTHIUS THE MOUTH OF THE NARROW PASSAGE IS DANGEROUSLY NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE OUTER COURT
EITHER IN WORD OR DEED AND I TRIED TO STOP THE OTHERS I SAW THEM BUT THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN AND NOW THEY ARE PAYING FOR THEIR FOLLY I WAS THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST IF YOU KILL ME
SO THAT HE FELL HEAVILY TO THE GROUND AND STRUCK THE EARTH WITH HIS FOREHEAD THEN TELEMACHUS SPRANG AWAY FROM HIM LEAVING HIS SPEAR STILL IN THE BODY FOR HE FEARED THAT IF HE STAYED TO DRAW IT OUT
THAT WE CANNOT STRING HIS BOW THIS WILL DISGRACE US IN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO ARE YET UNBORN IT SHALL NOT BE SO EURYMACHUS SAID ANTINOUS AND YOU KNOW IT YOURSELF
WHO WAS THE HEAD AND FRONT OF THE OFFENDING LIES LOW ALREADY IT WAS ALL HIS DOING IT WAS NOT THAT HE WANTED TO MARRY PENELOPE HE DID NOT SO MUCH CARE ABOUT THAT WHAT HE WANTED WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT AND JOVE
THAT THE SON OF SCHEMING SATURN HAD SENT HIM
FOR SHE SAW THAT A GREAT DEED HAD BEEN DONE BUT ULYSSES CHECKED HER OLD WOMAN SAID HE REJOICE IN SILENCE RESTRAIN YOURSELF AND DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISE ABOUT IT IT IS AN UNHOLY THING
IF YOU ARE ULYSSES SAID HE THEN WHAT YOU HAVE SAID IS JUST WE HAVE DONE MUCH WRONG ON YOUR LANDS AND IN YOUR HOUSE
AND WHEN HER TEARS HAD RELIEVED HER SHE WENT TO THE CLOISTER WHERE THE SUITORS WERE CARRYING THE BOW AND THE QUIVER WITH THE MANY DEADLY ARROWS THAT WERE INSIDE IT ALONG WITH HER CAME HER MAIDENS
WHO KILLS EVERY ONE THAT COMES NEAR HIM YOU WILL NEVER GET AWAY ALIVE SO DRINK AND KEEP QUIET WITHOUT GETTING INTO A QUARREL WITH MEN YOUNGER THAN YOURSELF PENELOPE THEN SPOKE TO HIM
HIM THE GLORY OF STRINGING IT I WILL GIVE HIM A CLOAK AND SHIRT OF GOOD WEAR WITH A JAVELIN TO KEEP OFF DOGS AND ROBBERS AND A SHARP SWORD I WILL ALSO GIVE HIM SANDALS AND WILL SEE HIM SENT SAFELY WHEREVER HE WANTS TO GO
DO NOT THEREFORE BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO CUT MY HEAD OFF YOUR OWN SON TELEMACHUS WILL TELL YOU THAT I DID NOT WANT TO FREQUENT YOUR HOUSE AND SING TO THE SUITORS AFTER THEIR MEALS BUT THEY WERE TOO MANY AND TOO STRONG FOR ME
ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK SO THAT HIS HEAD FELL ROLLING IN THE DUST WHILE HE WAS YET SPEAKING
BUT KILLED HIM IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING AND KEPT THE MARES HIMSELF IT WAS WHEN CLAIMING THESE
WE WILL NOT LET YOUR SONS LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE NOR YOUR DAUGHTERS NOR SHALL YOUR WIDOW
THAT HE HAS DONE IN YOUR HOUSE ULYSSES ANSWERED TELEMACHUS AND I WILL HOLD THESE SUITORS IN CHECK NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO
YOU COUNTRY LOUTS SAID HE SILLY SIMPLETONS WHY SHOULD YOU ADD TO THE SORROWS OF YOUR MISTRESS BY CRYING IN THIS WAY SHE HAS ENOUGH TO GRIEVE HER IN THE LOSS OF HER HUSBAND SIT STILL THEREFORE
AND SEND HIS ARROW THROUGH EACH ONE OF TWELVE AXES HIM WILL I FOLLOW AND QUIT THIS HOUSE OF MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SO GOODLY AND SO ABOUNDING IN WEALTH BUT EVEN SO I DOUBT NOT THAT I SHALL REMEMBER IT IN MY DREAMS
FOR THE FOOT WHICH YOU GAVE ULYSSES WHEN HE WAS BEGGING ABOUT IN HIS OWN HOUSE THUS SPOKE THE STOCKMAN AND ULYSSES STRUCK THE SON OF DAMASTOR WITH A SPEAR IN CLOSE FIGHT
THAT YOU ARE SO LAMENTABLY LESS VALIANT NOW THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN GROUND FACE TO FACE WITH THE SUITORS IN YOUR OWN HOUSE COME ON MY GOOD FELLOW STAND BY MY SIDE AND SEE HOW MENTOR
ALONG WITH FRAGRANT HERBS REACHING THENCE SHE TOOK DOWN THE BOW WITH ITS BOW CASE FROM THE PEG ON WHICH IT HUNG SHE SAT DOWN WITH IT ON HER KNEES WEEPING BITTERLY AS SHE TOOK THE BOW OUT OF ITS CASE
THE REST APPROVED HIS WORDS AND THEREON MEN SERVANTS POURED WATER OVER THE HANDS OF THE GUESTS WHILE PAGES FILLED THE MIXING BOWLS WITH WINE AND WATER AND HANDED IT ROUND AFTER GIVING EVERY MAN HIS DRINK OFFERING
THAT WAS OWING FROM THE WHOLE PEOPLE FOR THE MESSENIANS HAD CARRIED OFF THREE HUNDRED SHEEP FROM ITHACA AND HAD SAILED AWAY WITH THEM AND WITH THEIR SHEPHERDS IN QUEST OF THESE ULYSSES TOOK A LONG JOURNEY WHILE STILL QUITE YOUNG
KILLED IPHITUS ERE THEY COULD DO SO THIS BOW THEN
THEY SHOWED NO DISRESPECT TO TELEMACHUS FOR HE HAS ONLY LATELY GROWN AND HIS MOTHER NEVER PERMITTED HIM TO GIVE ORDERS TO THE FEMALE SERVANTS BUT LET ME GO UPSTAIRS AND TELL YOUR WIFE ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED
THEY WASHED THEIR HANDS AND FEET AND WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE FOR ALL WAS NOW OVER
BUT HE BROUGHT IT UPON HIMSELF THROUGH HIS OWN DRUNKENNESS IN LIKE MANNER I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WILL GO HARDLY WITH YOU IF YOU STRING THE BOW YOU WILL FIND NO MERCY FROM ANY ONE HERE
AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HIS RAGS ASIDE FROM THE GREAT SCAR AND WHEN THEY HAD EXAMINED IT THOROUGHLY THEY BOTH OF THEM WEPT ABOUT ULYSSES THREW THEIR ARMS ROUND HIM AND KISSED HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS
AS SHE SPOKE SHE TOLD EUMAEUS TO SET THE BOW AND THE PIECES OF IRON BEFORE THE SUITORS AND EUMAEUS WEPT AS HE TOOK THEM TO DO AS SHE HAD BIDDEN HIM HARD BY THE STOCKMAN WEPT ALSO
CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD TAKE ME HOME WITH HIM
TO TELL THE WOMEN AND MAKE THEM COME TO ULYSSES IN THE MEANTIME HE CALLED TELEMACHUS THE STOCKMAN AND THE SWINEHERD BEGIN SAID HE TO REMOVE THE DEAD AND MAKE THE WOMEN HELP YOU THEN
HAS TREATED MARGARITONE'S WORKS WITH PROFOUND DISDAIN THEY ARE HE SAYS MERELY CRUDE DAUBS IN THOSE UNFORTUNATE TIMES PEOPLE COULD NEITHER DRAW NOR PAINT SUCH WAS THE COMMON OPINION OF THE CONNOISSEURS OF THE DAYS OF POWDERED WIGS
LIKE THE IDOLS OF THE ROMANS THERE WILL BE A SACRED ART AND A PROFANE ART AND THE SACRED ART WILL NOT BE LESS PROFANE THAN THE OTHER
FOR THE SEEDS OF THESE PLANTS GERMINATE IN THE PERICARP THE SELF IMPORTANCE WHICH THE PENGUIN LADIES GIVE THEMSELVES DOES NOT GO SO FAR BACK AS THAT
AND WHEN THE MAID IN MY BOARDING HOUSE HAD SERVED MY MEAL I KEPT POURING SPOONFULS OF SOUP INTO MY EAR WITH ALL THE ARTLESSNESS OF CHILDHOOD IT IS BY SUCH RESULTS ADDS MAC SILLY THAT THE EXCELLENCE OF A WORK OF ART IS PROVED
AND HOLDING THE INFANT JESUS IN HER ARMS WHAT STRIKES ONE FIRST WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THIS FIGURE IS THE PROPORTION THE BODY FROM THE NECK TO THE FEET IS ONLY TWICE AS LONG AS THE HEAD SO THAT IT APPEARS EXTREMELY SHORT AND PODGY
THIS BUSY MAN TAXED HIS INGENUITY TO PLEASE THEM AND HE SOMETIMES SUCCEEDED HE GOT THEM CARDS FOR FASHIONABLE FUNCTIONS AND BOXES AT THE OPERA HE FURNISHED MADEMOISELLE CLARENCE WITH SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES OF APPEARING TO GREAT ADVANTAGE
AND WE SHOULD ESTABLISH GARAGES UPON THEM AND FOOT BRIDGES OVER THEM AND SO CREATE ORDER AND HARMONY AMONG THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION OF THE FUTURE THAT IS THE WISH OF EVERY GOOD CITIZEN
OF MEMLING OF ROGER VAN DER WEYDEN OF THE PAINTER OF THE DEATH OF MARY OF AMBROGIO LORENZETTI AND OF THE OLD UMBRIAN MASTERS
WE CAN FORM A NOTION OF THE PENGUIN PRIMITIVES FROM THE ITALIAN FLEMISH AND DUTCH PRIMITIVES AND FROM THE FRENCH PRIMITIVES WHO ARE SUPERIOR TO ALL THE REST
LOGIC BEING A PECULIARLY FRENCH QUALITY EVEN IF THIS IS DENIED IT MUST AT LEAST BE ADMITTED THAT TO FRANCE BELONGS THE CREDIT OF HAVING KEPT PRIMITIVES WHEN THE OTHER NATIONS KNEW THEM NO LONGER
BEING NOW ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH MINISTERS AND WITH THE PRESIDENT EVELINE CONTINUED TO WEAR HER ARISTOCRATIC AND PIOUS AFFECTATIONS AND THESE WON FOR HER THE SYMPATHY OF THE CHIEF PERSONAGES IN THE ANTI CLERICAL AND DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
MARGARITONE'S VISION
AND IN IT I DISCOVERED A PAINTING BY MARGARITONE A SAINT FRANCIS THE PIOUS SADNESS OF WHICH MOVED ME TO TEARS I WAS DEEPLY TOUCHED
YOUR CONSTITUENCY IS ONE OF THE FINEST IN ALCA AND THERE ARE FRESH IMPROVEMENTS MADE IN IT EVERY DAY MADAME UNFORTUNATELY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A STROLL THROUGH IT ANY LONGER
AND HE USED THEM IN ALL THEIR PURITY WITHOUT EVER MODIFYING THE TONES FROM THIS IT FOLLOWS THAT HIS COLOURING HAS MORE VIVACITY THAN HARMONY THE CHEEKS OF THE VIRGIN AND THOSE OF THE CHILD ARE OF A BRIGHT VERMILION
AND PUTTING ITS STRENGTH AT THE SERVICE OF THE ENTIRE PEOPLE WILL BEHAVE LIKE A DOCILE TOILING MONSTER BUT IN ORDER THAT THE MOTOR MAY CEASE TO BE INJURIOUS AND BECOME BENEFICENT WE MUST BUILD ROADS SUITED TO ITS SPEED
BUT THEY HAVE COMMON CHARACTERS THAT ARE FOUND IN ALL SCHOOLS I MEAN FORMULAS FROM WHICH THEY NEVER DEPART AND THERE IS BESIDES SOMETHING FINISHED IN THEIR WORK FOR WHAT THEY KNOW THEY KNOW WELL LUCKILY
THE SCRUPLES OF RESPECTABLE YOUNG GIRLS COULD BE MORE EASILY OVERCOME THAN THOSE OF MARRIED WOMEN IF THE SAME PRESSURE WERE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THEM AND FOR THIS THERE ARE TWO REASONS THEY HAVE MORE ILLUSIONS AND THEIR CURIOSITY HAS NOT BEEN SATISFIED
SEEING THAT SHE WAS SUCCEEDING AND DOING HIM CREDIT LIKED HER STILL MORE HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO FALL MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER HENCEFORTH IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING SHE BEGAN TO OBSERVE HIM WITH INTEREST BEING CURIOUS TO SEE IF HIS PASSION WOULD INCREASE
AND AT THREE O'CLOCK ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS ONE SUNDAY AS HE CALLED ON THE CLARENCES HE FOUND EVELINE ALONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM HE HAD BEEN CHATTING FOR ABOUT TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE MINUTES WHEN TAKING OUT HIS WATCH HE SAW THAT IT WAS A QUARTER TO THREE
BUT THE PORPOISES CLAIM THAT THEIR ARTISTS WERE UNDOUBTEDLY THE INSTRUCTORS AND MASTERS OF THE PENGUINS IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORM AN OPINION ON THE MATTER BECAUSE THE PENGUINS BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO ADMIRE THEIR PRIMITIVE PAINTERS DESTROYED ALL THEIR WORKS
RESPECTABLE YOUNG GIRLS SAID HE ARE GUARDED AND WATCHED OVER BESIDES MEN DO NOT AS A RULE PURSUE THEM MUCH
AMIDST PATRICIANS FAIR LADIES MUSICIANS PAGES NEGROES DOGS AND PARROTS HE SAW IN AN INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION OF HUMAN LIMBS OUTSPREAD WINGS AND FLYING DRAPERIES
BUT PROFESSOR HADDOCK SOON DISPLAYED HIS FASTIDIOUS INSOLENCE IT SEEMS TO ME SAID HE THAT THE PENGUIN LADIES HAVE MADE A GREAT FUSS SINCE THROUGH SAINT MAEL'S AGENCY THEY BECAME VIVIPAROUS
IN WHICH THE AUTHOR COMPLAINED THAT AN IRRATIONAL CUSTOM WENT ON PROFESSOR HADDOCK PREVENTS RESPECTABLE YOUNG LADIES FROM MAKING LOVE A THING THEY WOULD ENJOY DOING
WE HAVE ONE BAD HABIT
THE ANGELS WILL AFFECT AN EQUIVOCAL AMBIGUOUS MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY WHICH WILL TROUBLE HEARTS WHAT DESIRE FOR HEAVEN WILL THESE REPRESENTATIONS IMPART NONE
EXCLAIMED THE OLD MASTER FOR IN PROPHETIC VISION HE SAW THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE SAINTS ASSUMING THE APPEARANCE OF MELANCHOLY ATHLETES
EVEN THEN WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT REALLY TAKES PLACE FOR THE REASON THAT WHAT IS HIDDEN IS NOT SEEN THIS IS A CONDITION NECESSARY TO THE EXISTENCE OF ALL SOCIETY
WITH HIS BROW CLASPED IN HIS HANDS HE EXCLAIMED
WHO ABOUT EIGHTEEN FORTY AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY BECAME SPECTACLED PROFESSORS AND FOUNDED THE CULT OF THE PRIMITIVES
DO NOT GIVE THEM A BAD NAME ANSWERED THE DEPUTY THEY ARE OUR GREAT NATIONAL INDUSTRY I KNOW THE PENGUINS OF TO DAY MAKE ME THINK OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS
IT WAS DURING THE ELECTIONS WHEN MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WERE AS THE PHRASE RUNS REQUESTING A RENEWAL OF THEIR MANDATES HE HAD AN OPPONENT WHO THOUGH NOT DANGEROUS AT FIRST AND NOT MUCH OF AN ORATOR WAS RICH AND WAS REPORTED TO BE GAINING VOTES EVERY DAY
BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE PARTICULARLY PROUD OF IN THAT FOR IT IS A STATE THEY SHARE IN COMMON WITH COWS AND PIGS
WHICH THE FRENZIED CUPIDITY OF MANUFACTURERS HURLS LIKE A JUGGERNAUT'S CAR UPON THE BEWILDERED PEOPLE AND OF WHICH THE IDLE AND FASHIONABLE MAKE A FOOLISH THOUGH FATAL ELEGANCE WILL SOON BEGIN TO PERFORM ITS TRUE FUNCTION
AND SHE PRAISED THE INNOCENCE OF YOUNG GIRLS IN TERMS FULL OF MODESTY AND GRACE IT WAS CHARMING TO HEAR HER PROFESSOR HADDOCK'S VIEWS ON THE SAME SUBJECT WERE ON THE CONTRARY PAINFUL TO LISTEN TO
WHICH THE OLD MASTER FROM A NAIVE PREFERENCE FOR CLEAR DEFINITIONS HAS PLACED ON EACH FACE IN TWO CIRCUMFERENCES AS EXACT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN TRACED OUT BY A PAIR OF COMPASSES A LEARNED CRITIC OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE ABBE LANZI
AND MANY CHARMING THINGS WERE SAID ABOUT IT LOVE IS A SACRIFICE
AND IN PARTICULAR AT A GARDEN PARTY WHICH ALTHOUGH GIVEN BY A MINISTER WAS REGARDED AS REALLY FASHIONABLE AND GAINED ITS FIRST SUCCESS IN SOCIETY CIRCLES FOR THE REPUBLIC
WHILST MERCENARY GIRLS DO IT TOO MUCH AND WITHOUT GETTING ANY ENJOYMENT OUT OF IT IT IS INDEED DEPLORABLE
THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO OR EVEN LONGER AT THAT PERIOD OF INDIGENCE AND SIMPLICITY THE MUNICIPAL MUSEUMS THOUGH USUALLY KEPT SHUT WERE ALWAYS OPENED TO FOREIGNERS ONE EVENING AN OLD WOMAN WITH A CANDLE SHOWED ME FOR HALF A LIRA
AT THAT PARTY EVELINE HAD BEEN MUCH NOTICED AND HAD ATTRACTED THE SPECIAL ATTENTION OF A YOUNG DIPLOMAT CALLED ROGER LAMBILLY WHO IMAGINING THAT SHE BELONGED TO A RATHER FAST SET INVITED HER TO HIS BACHELOR'S FLAT SHE THOUGHT HIM HANDSOME AND BELIEVED HIM RICH
AND SHE ACCEPTED A LITTLE MOVED ALMOST DISQUIETED SHE VERY NEARLY BECAME THE VICTIM OF HER DARING AND ONLY AVOIDED DEFEAT BY AN OFFENSIVE MEASURE AUDACIOUSLY CARRIED OUT THIS WAS THE MOST FOOLISH ESCAPADE IN HER UNMARRIED LIFE
DOES NOT SHRINK FROM PLACING THE MADONNA OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY ON A LEVEL WITH THE MASTERPIECES OF CHRISTIAN ART BY GIVING TO THE VIRGIN'S HEAD SAYS SIR JAMES TUCKETT A THIRD OF THE TOTAL HEIGHT OF THE FIGURE
WAS EVER ANYTHING AS FINE AS OUR ARCADED BRIDGES AND OUR DOMED HOTELS YOU ARE FORGETTING THAT BIG PALACE SURMOUNTED AN IMMENSE MELON SHAPED DOME
THE OLD MASTER ATTRACTS THE SPECTATOR'S ATTENTION AND KEEPS IT DIRECTED TOWARDS THE MORE SUBLIME PARTS OF THE HUMAN FIGURE AND IN PARTICULAR THE EYES WHICH WE ORDINARILY DESCRIBE AS THE SPIRITUAL ORGANS IN THIS PICTURE
SAINT MARTHA A BELLY SAINT BARBARA HIPS
THE YOUNG GIRL SHOWED HERSELF AMIABLE ENGAGING ATTRACTIVE AND FULL OF PROMISES
RECONSTRUCTIONS AND ALL OTHER FRUITFUL OPERATIONS WE BUILD TO DAY IN AN ADMIRABLE STYLE SAID HE EVERYWHERE MAJESTIC AVENUES ARE BEING REARED
AND SAINT GEORGE WILL DISPLAY BENEATH HIS ARMOUR THE MUSCULAR WEALTH OF A ROBUST VIRILITY
COLOURING AND DESIGN CONSPIRE TO PRODUCE AN IDEAL AND MYSTICAL IMPRESSION THE VERMILION OF THE CHEEKS DOES NOT RECALL THE NATURAL APPEARANCE OF THE SKIN IT RATHER SEEMS AS IF THE OLD MASTER HAS APPLIED THE ROSES OF PARADISE TO THE FACES OF THE MOTHER
CROWDS OF TUMULTUOUS NATIVITIES OPULENT HOLY FAMILIES EMPHATIC CRUCIFIXIONS
HE NOTICED IN THE STUDIO A FRESHLY PAINTED MADONNA WHICH ALTHOUGH SEVERE AND RIGID NEVERTHELESS BY A CERTAIN EXACTNESS IN THE PROPORTIONS AND A DEVILISH MINGLING OF LIGHT AND SHADE ASSUMED AN APPEARANCE OF RELIEF AND LIFE
BUT THIS SELF IMPORTANCE WAS LONG KEPT IN RESTRAINT AND DISPLAYED ITSELF FULLY ONLY WITH INCREASED LUXURY OF DRESS AND IN A SMALL SECTION OF SOCIETY FOR GO ONLY TWO LEAGUES FROM ALCA INTO THE COUNTRY AT HARVEST TIME AND YOU WILL SEE WHETHER WOMEN ARE OVER PRECISE OR SELF IMPORTANT
NOR PERUGIA THAT COMPLETED MY INITIATION
HE WAS A DEPUTY OF ALCA AND ONE OF THE YOUNGEST MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE HIS FATHER WAS SAID TO HAVE KEPT A DRAM SHOP BUT HE HIMSELF WAS A LAWYER OF ROBUST PHYSIQUE A GOOD THOUGH PROLIX SPEAKER WITH A SELF IMPORTANT AIR AND A REPUTATION FOR ABILITY
I PICTURE TO MYSELF THE PENGUIN PRIMITIVES IN CONFORMITY WITH THE WORKS OF THAT MASTER IT WILL NOT THEREFORE BE THOUGHT SUPERFLUOUS IF IN THIS PLACE I CONSIDER HIS WORKS WITH SOME ATTENTION IF NOT IN DETAIL AT LEAST UNDER THEIR MORE GENERAL AND
AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES WERE SOON TO BE AVENGED FOR THIS CRUEL CONTEMPT THERE WAS BORN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN THE BIBLICAL VILLAGES AND REFORMED COTTAGES OF PIOUS ENGLAND A MULTITUDE OF LITTLE SAMUELS AND LITTLE SAINT JOHNS WITH HAIR CURLING LIKE LAMBS
STAY A LITTLE LONGER SAID SHE IN A PRESSING AND AGREEABLE VOICE WHICH MADE HIM PROMPTLY SIT DOWN AGAIN SHE WAS FULL OF INTEREST OF ABANDON CURIOSITY AND WEAKNESS HE BLUSHED TURNED PALE AND AGAIN GOT UP
AND THE CHILD WE SEE IN SUCH A CRITICISM AS THIS A SHINING REFLECTION SO TO SPEAK OF THE WORK WHICH IT EXALTS YET MAC SILLY THE SERAPHIC AESTHETE OF EDINBURGH HAS EXPRESSED IN A STILL MORE MOVING AND PENETRATING FASHION
GIRLS DO NOT DENY THEMSELVES THAT PLEASURE IT IS DEPRAVITY
MADAME CLARENCE WHO NOW LIKED ATTENTION THOUGHT HIM AGREEABLE
I DECLARE MYSELF THE YOUNG LADIES CHAMPION HE MUST BE A FOOL
THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED UPON HIS MIND BY THE SIGHT OF THIS PRIMITIVE PAINTING
IF THE EVIL EXISTS AS HE SAYS IT DOES IN OUR MIDDLE CLASS SOCIETY I CAN ASSURE HIM THAT EVERYWHERE ELSE HE WOULD SEE A CONSOLING SPECTACLE AMONG THE PEOPLE
THE EXHIBITION OF FRENCH PRIMITIVES AT THE PAVILION MARSAN IN NINETEEN O FOUR CONTAINED SEVERAL LITTLE PANELS CONTEMPORARY WITH THE LATER VALOIS KINGS
REGRETTING THAT HE HAD LIVED TO SEE A NEW FORM OF ART ARISING AND THE NEW ARTISTS CROWNED WITH FAME THESE LINES WHICH I TRANSLATE LITERALLY HAVE INSPIRED SIR JAMES TUCKETT WITH WHAT ARE PERHAPS THE FINEST PAGES IN HIS WORK
A CATAFALQUE RESTING ON TRESTLES OF OAK THE YOUNG MAN PREPARED FOR THIS SCENE BY THE STATE OF HIS OWN FEELINGS WHICH WERE MOURNFUL AND BY THE MAJESTY OF THE CATHEDRAL WHICH HE HAD PASSED THROUGH DESCENDED IN A SLOW AND SOLEMN MANNER
THEY SET OUT PASSING OVER THE PONT NEUF
IN RECALLING ALL HE HAD BEEN THROUGH HE FORESAW ALL THAT RAOUL MIGHT SUFFER AND THE EXPRESSION OF THE DEEP AND TENDER COMPASSION WHICH THROBBED IN HIS HEART WAS PICTURED IN THE MOIST EYE WITH WHICH HE GAZED ON THE YOUNG MAN
BUT HE DID HIS BEST TO KEEP UP WITH HIS HOST MEANWHILE HIS MISGIVINGS IN REGARD TO MOUSQUETON RECURRED TO HIS MIND AND WITH GREATER FORCE BECAUSE MOUSQUETON THOUGH HE DID NOT HIMSELF WAIT ON THE TABLE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN BENEATH HIM IN HIS NEW POSITION APPEARED AT THE DOOR FROM TIME TO TIME
TIS ONLY BECAUSE MONSIEUR DE LA FERE HAS SPOKEN OF FRIENDSHIP THAT I QUESTION YOUR CONDUCT
BECAUSE I BENT MY ARM AND RESTED MY HAND ON MY ELBOW SO DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN YES SIR I HAVE FIRED SINCE IN THAT MANNER AND HAVE BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL WHAT A COLD WIND RESUMED ATHOS A WINTRY BLAST
YOURS IS A NOBLE NATURE HE SAID HERE IS YOUR SWORD RAOUL BENT HIS KNEE TO THE GROUND IT WAS WORN BY MY FATHER A LOYAL GENTLEMAN
AT THIS MOMENT RAOUL AWOKE WITHOUT A CLOUD ON HIS FACE WITHOUT WEARINESS OR LASSITUDE
THERE WAS A SOLEMN THOUGH MOMENTARY SILENCE WHICH WAS BROKEN BY ARAMIS I SWEAR HE SAID WITH A CALM BROW AND KINDLY GLANCE BUT IN A VOICE STILL TREMBLING WITH RECENT EMOTION I SWEAR THAT I NO LONGER BEAR ANIMOSITY TO THOSE WHO WERE ONCE MY FRIENDS
THAT DEVIL PORTHOS IS A MAN OF PRODIGIOUS STRENGTH STILL IF ATHOS JOINS US
WHO HAS SO WARMLY WELCOMED ME WILL MONSIEUR REMAIN LONG WITH US ASKED MOUSQUETON WITH A SERENE AND GLOWING COUNTENANCE I GO TO MORROW MY FRIEND REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN AH MONSIEUR SAID MOUSQUETON THEN YOU HAVE COME HERE ONLY TO AWAKEN OUR REGRETS
AND POINTING TO THE COFFIN THIS TEMPORARY SEPULTURE IS HE SAID THAT OF A MAN WHO WAS OF FEEBLE MIND YET ONE WHOSE REIGN WAS FULL OF GREAT EVENTS
TAKE CARE RAOUL I HAVE ALREADY OFTEN TOLD YOU OF THIS YOU MUST NOT FORGET IT FOR IT IS A GREAT DEFECT IN A RIDER SEE YOUR HORSE IS TIRED ALREADY HE FROTHS AT THE MOUTH WHILST MINE LOOKS AS IF HE HAD ONLY JUST LEFT THE STABLE
LET US PUT OUR SWORDS INTO OUR LEFT HANDS AND SHAKE HANDS WITH THE RIGHT
GENTLEMEN HE SAID OUR PRESENCE HERE IS THE BEST PROOF OF FORMER FRIENDSHIP NOT ONE OF US HAS FAILED THE OTHERS AT THIS RENDEZVOUS NOT ONE HAS THEREFORE TO REPROACH HIMSELF HEAR ME COUNT REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN
AND I EVEN I OPPOSED THE DESIGNS OF THE GREAT MAN WHO HELD THE DESTINIES OF FRANCE WITHIN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND RAOUL LEARN HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE KING FROM ROYALTY THE KING IS BUT A MAN
NO INDEED SIR ANSWERED RAOUL
OH CRIED MOUSQUETON REDDENING WITH JOY IF YOU DO ME SIR SUCH HONOR I SHALL BE GRATEFUL ALL MY LIFE IT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK ALAS THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN IT IS VERY LITTLE TO OFFSET THE UNEXPECTED TRIBULATIONS I AM BRINGING TO THIS POOR DEVIL
SAY IT THEN IF I AM IN FAULT I WILL AVOW THE ERROR THE GRAVE AND HARMONIOUS TONES OF THAT BELOVED VOICE SEEMED TO HAVE STILL ITS ANCIENT INFLUENCE WHILST THAT OF ARAMIS WHICH HAD BECOME HARSH AND TUNELESS IN HIS MOMENTS OF ILL HUMOR
RAOUL AROSE AND THREW HIMSELF WITH EMOTION INTO THE COUNT'S ARMS ADIEU FALTERED THE COUNT WHO FELT HIS HEART DIE AWAY WITHIN HIM ADIEU AND THINK OF ME
WHICH IS THAT IN FIRING OFF YOUR PISTOL YOU HOLD YOUR ARM TOO FAR OUTSTRETCHED THIS TENSION LESSENS THE ACCURACY OF THE AIM SO IN TWELVE TIMES YOU THRICE MISSED THE MARK WHICH YOU SIR STRUCK TWELVE TIMES ANSWERED RAOUL SMILING
WE LIVED TOGETHER WE LOVED WE HATED TOGETHER WE SHED WE MINGLED OUR BLOOD TOGETHER AND TOO PROBABLY I MAY STILL ADD THAT THERE MAY BE YET A BOND BETWEEN US CLOSER EVEN THAN THAT OF FRIENDSHIP
HE LOOKED LONG ON THIS YOUNG MAN WHOSE SMILING MOUTH AND HALF CLOSED EYES BESPOKE SOFT DREAMS AND LIGHTEST SLUMBER AS IF HIS GUARDIAN ANGEL WATCHED OVER HIM WITH SOLICITUDE AND AFFECTION
AND AS FOR ME SAID PORTHOS I SWEAR NOTHING BUT I'M CHOKED FORSOOTH IF I WERE OBLIGED TO FIGHT AGAINST YOU
GENTLEMEN NEVERTHELESS OF RANK AND CONDITION ARE AS NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THE COLD CORPSE THERE EXTENDED I SHALL ADORE GOD SIR SAID RAOUL RESPECT ROYALTY AND EVER SERVE THE KING AND IF DEATH BE MY LOT
AND PERHAPS HE COMPREHENDED ALL THAT PASSED IN THE HEART OF THE MAN WHO WAS AWAITING HIS AWAKENING AS A LOVER AWAITS THE AWAKENING OF HIS MISTRESS FOR HIS GLANCE IN RETURN HAD ALL THE TENDERNESS OF LOVE YOU ARE THERE SIR
FOR I NEVER LOVED ANY ONE BUT YOU IN THE WIDE WORLD AND HONEST PORTHOS BURST INTO TEARS AS HE EMBRACED ATHOS MY FRIENDS SAID ATHOS THIS IS WHAT I EXPECTED FROM SUCH HEARTS AS YOURS YES I HAVE SAID IT AND I NOW REPEAT IT
PLANCHET YES I HAVE FOUND HIM AGAIN
JOY SHONE IN RAOUL'S EYES AND HE LEAPED LIGHTLY TO HIS SADDLE
SO FRESH HIS OWN YOUTH SEEMED TO REAPPEAR BRINGING WITH IT ALL THOSE SAVOURY REMEMBRANCES WHICH ARE LIKE PERFUMES MORE THAN THOUGHTS BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE PRESENT WAS AN INEFFABLE ABYSS
POLISH UP OR MAKE SOME ONE ELSE POLISH MY ARMS THEN TAKE PISTOLS WITH THEE AND A HUNTING KNIFE ARE WE THEN GOING TO TRAVEL MY LORD ASKED MOUSQUETON RATHER UNEASY SOMETHING BETTER STILL MOUSTON AN EXPEDITION SIR ASKED THE STEWARD WHOSE ROSES BEGAN TO CHANGE INTO LILIES
HE HAS SET UP A LITTLE SHOP IN THE RUE DES LOMBARDS AND IS NOW A CONFECTIONER AH HE IS A CONFECTIONER IN THE RUE DES LOMBARDS
AND JUST BELOW THIS LAMP THERE WAS LAID WRAPPED IN A FLOWING MANTLE OF VIOLET VELVET
WHY REPLIED PORTHOS MOUSTON OF COURSE THIS WAS A BLOW TO D'ARTAGNAN HE COULD ALREADY SEE THE INTENDANT'S BEAMING SMILE CHANGE TO A CONTORTION OF GRIEF BUT HE SAID MOUSTON IS NOT SO YOUNG AS HE WAS MY DEAR FELLOW BESIDES HE HAS GROWN FAT
SO SURE TO BE EXALTED BY THE GLORIES OF A THRONE DUST OF THE EARTH HERE I AWAIT THEE THERE WAS PROFOUND SILENCE
AND HE WIPED HIS EYES STILL MOIST HAS NOT ONE OF YOU A CROSS ASKED ATHOS ARAMIS SMILED AND DREW FROM HIS VEST A CROSS OF DIAMONDS WHICH WAS HUNG AROUND HIS NECK BY A CHAIN OF PEARLS HERE IS ONE HE SAID
SHOWED TO PORTHOS A BLUE RIBBON AND A DUCAL MANTLE THEY WERE IN FACT ASLEEP ON THE TABLE WHEN THE SERVANTS CAME TO LIGHT THEM TO THEIR BED MOUSQUETON WAS HOWEVER SOMEWHAT CONSOLED BY D'ARTAGNAN WHO THE NEXT DAY TOLD HIM THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY
HOWEVER BECAUSE I WAS PRUDENT YOU MUST NOT TAKE ME FOR A FOOL
AFTER SPEAKING IN A LOW VOICE TO THE LACKEY WHO INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THEM IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THEIR ROOMS RAOUL DELIGHTED AT THE COUNT'S COMPANIONSHIP PERCEIVED OR AFFECTED TO PERCEIVE NOTHING OF THIS BYPLAY
BEFORE THESE MORTAL SPOILS OF THE LAST KING WHO WAS NOT TO BE PLACED BY THE SIDE OF HIS FOREFATHERS UNTIL HIS SUCCESSOR SHOULD TAKE HIS PLACE THERE AND WHO APPEARED TO ABIDE ON THAT SPOT THAT HE MIGHT THUS ADDRESS HUMAN PRIDE
BUT IMAGINATION HAS THE WINGS OF AN ANGEL OF LIGHT AND TRAVELS SAFELY THROUGH OR OVER THE SEAS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ALMOST SHIPWRECKED THE DARKNESS IN WHICH OUR ILLUSIONS ARE LOST THE PRECIPICE WHENCE OUR HAPPINESS HAS BEEN HURLED AND SWALLOWED UP
ARE WE NOT PRETTY GOOD CHRISTIANS
HE REMEMBERED THAT ALL THE FIRST PART OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN EMBITTERED BY A WOMAN AND HE THOUGHT WITH ALARM OF THE INFLUENCE LOVE MIGHT ASSUME OVER SO FINE AND AT THE SAME TIME SO VIGOROUS AN ORGANIZATION AS THAT OF RAOUL
HE SAID RESPECTFULLY YES RAOUL REPLIED THE COUNT AND YOU DID NOT AWAKEN ME I WISHED TO LEAVE YOU STILL TO ENJOY SOME MOMENTS OF SLEEP MY CHILD YOU MUST BE FATIGUED FROM YESTERDAY OH SIR HOW GOOD YOU ARE
IF RICHELIEU MADE THE KING BY COMPARISON SEEM SMALL HE MADE ROYALTY GREAT THE PALACE OF THE LOUVRE CONTAINS TWO THINGS THE KING WHO MUST DIE AND ROYALTY WHICH NEVER DIES
A LOVE AS TENDER AS THAT OF A LOVER FOR HIS MISTRESS DWELLS UNDOUBTEDLY IN SOME PATERNAL HEARTS TOWARD A SON
I SHALL PASS ALL MY LIFE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN IN SEEKING FOR A MAN WHO IS REALLY CONTENTED WITH HIS LOT WHILST MAKING THIS REFLECTION CHANCE SEEMED AS IT WERE TO GIVE HIM THE LIE DIRECT WHEN PORTHOS HAD LEFT HIM TO GIVE SOME ORDERS
BUT ALAS THE POOR FELLOW DOES NOT KNOW THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH I AM HERE HE THEN MADE A SIGN FOR MOUSQUETON TO COME TO HIM SIR SAID THE SERVANT I HAVE A FAVOUR TO ASK YOU SPEAK OUT MY FRIEND I AM AFRAID TO DO SO
HE WHO FIRES THE FIRST SHOT RARELY HITS HIS MAN FOR HE FIRES WITH THE APPREHENSION OF BEING DISARMED BEFORE AN ARMED FOE THEN WHILST HE FIRES MAKE YOUR HORSE REAR
THEN ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING RAOUL SHOULD YOU BE WOUNDED IN A BATTLE AND FALL FROM YOUR HORSE IF YOU HAVE ANY STRENGTH LEFT DISENTANGLE YOURSELF FROM THE LINE THAT YOUR REGIMENT HAS FORMED OTHERWISE IT MAY BE DRIVEN BACK
HE SAW MOUSQUETON APPROACHING THE FACE OF THE STEWARD DESPITE ONE SLIGHT SHADE OF CARE LIGHT AS A SUMMER CLOUD SEEMED A PHYSIOGNOMY OF ABSOLUTE FELICITY HERE IS WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN
THE HORSES ARE WAITING AND I WAS ASLEEP CRIED RAOUL WHILST YOU SIR YOU HAD THE KINDNESS TO ATTEND TO ALL THESE DETAILS TRULY SIR YOU OVERWHELM ME WITH BENEFITS
SWEAR ON THIS CROSS WHICH IN SPITE OF ITS MAGNIFICENT MATERIAL IS STILL A CROSS
SHOULD ANY HARM BEFALL ME YOUR NAME WILL BE THE LAST NAME THAT I SHALL UTTER THE REMEMBRANCE OF YOU MY LAST THOUGHT
HE DARED NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK AND RAOUL WENT AWAY HIS HEAD UNCOVERED ATHOS REMAINED MOTIONLESS LOOKING AFTER HIM UNTIL HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE STREET THEN THE COUNT THREW THE BRIDLE OF HIS HORSE INTO THE HANDS OF A PEASANT
PENETRATED INTO THE ROOM THROUGH THE WINDOW THE CURTAINS OF WHICH RAOUL HAD NEGLECTED TO CLOSE ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HE WAS STILL SLEEPING HIS HEAD GRACEFULLY REPOSING ON HIS ARM
WHEN THE HILT WAS IN MY HAND AND THE SHEATH AT MY SIDE SHOULD YOUR HAND STILL BE TOO WEAK TO USE THIS SWORD RAOUL SO MUCH THE BETTER YOU WILL HAVE THE MORE TIME TO LEARN TO DRAW IT ONLY WHEN IT OUGHT TO BE USED SIR REPLIED RAOUL
D'ARTAGNAN WHO AS A GASCON WAS INCLINED TO SOBRIETY
ASHAMED OF SO MUCH ATTENTION IN AN INSTANT I SHALL BE DRESSED ATHOS THEN CALLED OLIVAIN
BE IT SO CRIED ARAMIS CARDINALISTS OR FRONDEURS WHAT MATTERS IT LET US MEET AGAIN AS CAPITAL SECONDS IN A DUEL DEVOTED FRIENDS IN BUSINESS MERRY COMPANIONS IN OUR ANCIENT PLEASURES
HOW DO YOU FEEL THIS MORNING HE INQUIRED PERFECTLY WELL QUITE RESTED SIR YOU ARE STILL GROWING ATHOS CONTINUED WITH THAT CHARMING AND PATERNAL INTEREST FELT BY A GROWN MAN FOR A YOUTH OH SIR I BEG YOUR PARDON EXCLAIMED RAOUL
AND WHO IN THE DARKNESS OF THIS NIGHT HEARETH US NEVER SHALL MY SWORD CROSS YOURS NEVER MY EYE EXPRESS A GLANCE OF ANGER
AND HE ADDED TURNING TO PORTHOS HERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO'S OF THE SAME OPINION AS MYSELF PORTHOS WHO HAD NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD ANSWERED MERELY BY A WORD AND A GESTURE
THERE WAS THIS MORNING IN HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE SOMETHING TARDY AND IRRESOLUTE HE WAS OCCUPIED WITH THE PREPARATIONS FOR RAOUL'S DEPARTURE AND WAS SEEKING TO GAIN TIME IN THE FIRST PLACE
REMOUNTED THE STEPS WENT INTO THE CATHEDRAL THERE TO KNEEL DOWN IN THE DARKEST CORNER
THE ROOM IN WHICH HE USUALLY SAT WAS SURROUNDED BY BOOK SHELVES CAREFULLY FILLED NOR WAS THERE A VOLUME THERE WHICH WAS NOT ENTITLED TO ITS PLACE IN SUCH A COLLECTION BOTH BY ITS INTRINSIC WORTH AND EXTERIOR SPLENDOUR
FROM THE SEWERS OF LONDON TO THE CENTRAL RAILWAY OF INDIA FROM THE PALACES OF SAINT PETERSBURG TO THE CABINS OF CONNAUGHT NOTHING CAN ESCAPE HIM BRITONS HAVE BUT TO READ TO OBEY AND BE BLESSED
WHAT A WORLD WITHIN A WORLD IS THE TEMPLE HOW QUIET ARE ITS ENTANGLED WALKS AS SOMEONE LATELY HAS CALLED THEM AND YET HOW CLOSE TO THE DENSEST CONCOURSE OF HUMANITY HOW GRAVELY RESPECTABLE ITS SOBER ALLEYS
HE WAS LINGERING OVER HIS LAST CUP OF TEA SURROUNDED BY AN OCEAN OF NEWSPAPERS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD BEEN SWIMMING WHEN JOHN BOLD'S CARD WAS BROUGHT IN BY HIS TIGER THIS TIGER NEVER KNEW THAT HIS MASTER WAS AT HOME
LORDS AND COMMONS CONTROLLED JUDGES INSTRUCTED IN LAW GENERALS IN STRATEGY ADMIRALS IN NAVAL TACTICS AND ORANGE WOMEN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR BARROWS YES MY FRIEND FROM THESE WALLS
THE GROVES OF CYPRUS ARE NOT MORE TACITURN THAN THOSE OF THE TEMPLE WIT AND WINE ARE ALWAYS HERE AND ALWAYS TOGETHER THE REVELS OF THE TEMPLE ARE AS THOSE OF POLISHED GREECE
AND A SCEPTRE BECAUSE THE MOST MIGHTY ONE WIELDS IT SO IT IS WITH MOUNT OLYMPUS SHOULD A STRANGER MAKE HIS WAY THITHER AT DULL NOONDAY OR DURING THE SLEEPY HOURS OF THE SILENT AFTERNOON
HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW AS A FACT THAT THEY HAD BEEN WRITTEN BY HIS FRIEND TOM TOWERS HAD NEVER SAID THAT SUCH A VIEW OF THE CASE OR SUCH A SIDE IN THE DISPUTE WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE PAPER WITH WHICH HE WAS CONNECTED
THE MOUTHPIECE OF ALL THE WISDOM OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY IT MAY PROBABLY BE SAID THAT NO PLACE IN THIS NINETEENTH CENTURY IS MORE WORTHY OF NOTICE NO TREASURY MANDATE ARMED WITH THE SIGNATURES OF ALL THE GOVERNMENT
NO ONE COULD INSULT HIM NO ONE COULD INQUIRE INTO HIM HE COULD SPEAK OUT WITHERING WORDS AND NO ONE COULD ANSWER HIM MINISTERS COURTED HIM THOUGH PERHAPS THEY KNEW NOT HIS NAME BISHOPS FEARED HIM
RETIRES TO REST FEARED AND HONOURED BY ALL HIS COUNTRYMEN FEARLESS HIMSELF IF NOT A GOOD MAN AT ANY RATE A MIGHTY MAN TOO MIGHTY TO CARE MUCH WHAT MEN MAY SAY ABOUT HIS WANT OF VIRTUE
DOES NOT THE JUPITER COMING FORTH DAILY WITH FIFTY THOUSAND IMPRESSIONS FULL OF UNERRING DECISION ON EVERY MORTAL SUBJECT SET ALL MATTERS SUFFICIENTLY AT REST IS NOT TOM TOWERS HERE ABLE TO GUIDE US AND WILLING
WITH VERDICTS FROM JUDICIAL BENCH GIVEN AFTER MUCH DELAY WITH DOUBTFUL LAWS AND THE FALLIBLE ATTEMPTS OF HUMANITY
IT IS TRUE THAT IN FAR OFF PROVINCES MEN DID NOT TALK DAILY OF TOM TOWERS BUT THEY READ THE JUPITER AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WITHOUT THE JUPITER
THIS KIND OF HIDDEN BUT STILL CONSCIOUS GLORY SUITED THE NATURE OF THE MAN HE LOVED TO SIT SILENT IN A CORNER OF HIS CLUB AND LISTEN TO THE LOUD CHATTERING OF POLITICIANS
A PRETTY PORTABLE SET OF STEPS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM SHOWED THAT THOSE EVEN ON THE HIGHER SHELVES WERE INTENDED FOR USE THE CHAMBER CONTAINED BUT TWO WORKS OF ART
THE MEN MOST FITTING TO COMPOSE IT AND HOW WE FAIL PARLIAMENT IS ALWAYS WRONG LOOK AT THE JUPITER AND SEE HOW FUTILE ARE THEIR MEETINGS HOW VAIN THEIR COUNCIL
BEFORE THE WINDOWS THE LAWN OF THE TEMPLE GARDENS STRETCHES WITH THAT DIM YET DELICIOUS VERDURE SO REFRESHING TO THE EYES OF LONDONERS IF DOOMED TO LIVE WITHIN THE THICKEST OF LONDON SMOKE
CLOTHED ARMED AND MANAGED THE MOST EXCELLENT OF OUR GOOD MEN DO THEIR BEST TO MAN OUR SHIPS WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ALL POSSIBLE EXTERNAL APPLIANCES BUT IN VAIN ALL ALL IS WRONG
ILL AS HE HAD FARED IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE ARCHDEACON HE WAS NOT THE LESS UNDER THE NECESSITY OF CARRYING OUT HIS PLEDGE TO ELEANOR AND HE WENT ABOUT HIS UNGRACIOUS TASK WITH A HEAVY HEART THE ATTORNEYS WHOM HE HAD EMPLOYED IN LONDON
OUR MODERN ARTISTS WHOM WE STYLE PRE RAPHAELITES HAVE DELIGHTED TO GO BACK NOT ONLY TO THE FINISH AND PECULIAR MANNER BUT ALSO TO THE SUBJECTS OF THE EARLY PAINTERS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE THEM TOO MUCH PRAISE
AN OLD OFFICE TABLE COVERED WITH DUSTY PAPERS WHICH ARE NOT MOVED ONCE IN SIX MONTHS AND AN OLDER PEMBROKE BROTHER WITH RICKETY LEGS FOR ALL DAILY USES A DESPATCHER FOR THE PREPARATION OF LOBSTERS AND COFFEE
RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS WITH SURPRISE AND EVIDENT MISGIVING HOWEVER THEY COULD ONLY OBEY AND MUTTER SOMETHING OF THEIR SORROW THAT SUCH HEAVY COSTS SHOULD ONLY FALL UPON THEIR OWN EMPLOYER
EACH OF WHICH WAS FURNISHED IF NOT WITH THE SPLENDOUR WITH PROBABLY MORE THAN THE COMFORT OF STAFFORD HOUSE EVERY ADDITION THAT SCIENCE AND ART HAVE LATELY MADE TO THE LUXURIES OF MODERN LIFE WAS TO BE FOUND THERE
BUT THEY ARE ANYTHING BUT HAPPY IN THEIR CHANGE AS A RULE NO FIGURE SHOULD BE DRAWN IN A POSITION WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPOSE ANY FIGURE SHOULD MAINTAIN THE PATIENT ENDURANCE OF SAINT SEBASTIAN
WHAT HAS MADE THIS AWFUL CHANGE WHAT HAS SO AFFLICTED HIM AN ARTICLE HAS APPEARED IN THE JUPITER SOME FIFTY LINES OF A NARROW COLUMN HAVE DESTROYED ALL HIS GRACE'S EQUANIMITY AND BANISHED HIM FOR EVER FROM THE WORLD
HOW HE COULD SMITE THE LOUDEST OF THEM WERE IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO RAISE HIS PEN FOR SUCH A PURPOSE HE LOVED TO WATCH THE GREAT MEN OF WHOM HE DAILY WROTE AND FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE WAS GREATER THAN ANY OF THEM
AND WHEN BOLD HAD BEEN ATTENDING THE LONDON HOSPITALS TOWERS WHO WAS NOT THEN THE GREAT MAN THAT HE HAD SINCE BECOME HAD BEEN MUCH WITH HIM THEN THEY HAD OFTEN DISCUSSED TOGETHER THE OBJECTS OF THEIR AMBITION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
VERY DISCREET IN SUCH MATTERS WAS TOM TOWERS AND ALTOGETHER INDISPOSED TO TALK LOOSELY OF THE CONCERNS
ALL LISTEN AND OBEY AND ALL WILL BE MADE PERFECT HAS NOT TOM TOWERS AN ALL SEEING EYE FROM THE DIGGINGS OF AUSTRALIA TO THOSE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT ROUND THE HABITABLE GLOBE
IT IS A FACT AMAZING TO ORDINARY MORTALS THAT THE JUPITER IS NEVER WRONG WITH WHAT ENDLESS CARE WITH WHAT UNSPARING LABOUR DO WE NOT STRIVE TO GET TOGETHER FOR OUR GREAT NATIONAL COUNCIL
ONLY LET NOT UNGRATEFUL MINISTERS SEEK OTHER COLLEAGUES THAN THOSE WHOM TOM TOWERS MAY APPROVE LET CHURCH AND STATE LAW AND PHYSIC COMMERCE AND AGRICULTURE THE ARTS OF WAR AND THE ARTS OF PEACE
DID HE BETAKE HIMSELF TO THE QUIET ABODE OF WISDOM WHERE TOM TOWERS WAS TO BE FOUND O MORNINGS INHALING AMBROSIA AND SIPPING NECTAR IN THE SHAPE OF TOAST AND TEA NOT FAR REMOVED FROM MOUNT OLYMPUS
WERE IT NOT WELL FOR US IN OUR IGNORANCE THAT WE CONFIDED ALL THINGS TO THE JUPITER WOULD IT NOT BE WISE IN US TO ABANDON USELESS TALKING IDLE THINKING AND PROFITLESS LABOUR
OR CANVASSING THE CONDUCT OF CABINET MINISTERS THINGS HAD ALTERED SINCE THAT TIME THE BRIEFLESS BARRISTER WAS STILL BRIEFLESS BUT HE NOW DESPISED BRIEFS COULD HE HAVE BEEN SURE OF A JUDGE'S SEAT
IS THIS MOUNT OLYMPUS ASKS THE UNBELIEVING STRANGER IS IT FROM THESE SMALL DARK DINGY BUILDINGS THAT THOSE INFALLIBLE LAWS PROCEED WHICH CABINETS ARE CALLED UPON TO OBEY BY WHICH BISHOPS ARE TO BE GUIDED
HE WOULD HARDLY HAVE LEFT HIS PRESENT CAREER IT IS TRUE HE WORE NO ERMINE BORE NO OUTWARD MARKS OF A WORLD'S RESPECT BUT WITH WHAT A LOAD OF INWARD IMPORTANCE WAS HE CHARGED
SUBVERSIVE OF THE COURTS OF WESTMINSTER AND ANTAGONISTIC TO THE ROLLS AND LINCOLN'S INN BUT NOTHING YET THREATENS THE SILENT BEAUTY OF THE TEMPLE IT IS THE MEDIAEVAL COURT OF THE METROPOLIS
HE RISES IN THE MORNING DEGRADED MEAN AND MISERABLE AN OBJECT OF MEN'S SCORN ANXIOUS ONLY TO RETIRE AS QUICKLY AS MAY BE TO SOME GERMAN OBSCURITY SOME UNSEEN ITALIAN PRIVACY OR INDEED ANYWHERE OUT OF SIGHT
THAT HIGH ABODE OF ALL THE POWERS OF TYPE THAT FAVOURED SEAT OF THE GREAT GODDESS PICA THAT WONDROUS HABITATION OF GODS AND DEVILS FROM WHENCE WITH CEASELESS HUM OF STEAM AND NEVER ENDING FLOW OF CASTALIAN INK
THOUGH HE OFTEN KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT AND THUS TOM TOWERS WAS NEVER INVADED BUT BY HIS OWN CONSENT ON THIS OCCASION AFTER TWISTING THE CARD TWICE IN HIS FINGERS HE SIGNIFIED TO HIS ATTENDANT IMP THAT HE WAS VISIBLE
NO MAN KNOWS WHO WROTE THE BITTER WORDS THE CLUBS TALK CONFUSEDLY OF THE MATTER WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER THIS AND THAT NAME WHILE TOM TOWERS WALKS QUIETLY ALONG PALL MALL WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED CLOSE AGAINST THE EAST WIND
IT HAD A STAND OR DESK ERECTED FOR ITS OWN ACCOMMODATION AND THERE ON HER PEDESTAL FRAMED AND GLAZED STOOD THE DEVOTIONAL LADY LOOKING INTENTLY AT A LILY AS NO LADY EVER LOOKED BEFORE
YES INDEED ABLE AND WILLING TO GUIDE ALL MEN IN ALL THINGS SO LONG AS HE IS OBEYED AS AUTOCRAT SHOULD BE OBEYED WITH UNDOUBTING SUBMISSION
A POPE WHO MANAGES HIS OWN INQUISITION WHO PUNISHES UNBELIEVERS AS NO MOST SKILFUL INQUISITOR OF SPAIN EVER DREAMT OF DOING ONE WHO CAN EXCOMMUNICATE THOROUGHLY FEARFULLY RADICALLY
NO ONE HERE WILL ASK WHETHER YOU ARE OUT OR AT HOME ALONE OR WITH FRIENDS HERE NO SABBATARIAN WILL INVESTIGATE YOUR SUNDAYS NO CENSORIOUS LANDLADY WILL SCRUTINISE YOUR EMPTY BOTTLE
NEVERTHELESS BOLD BELIEVED THAT TO HIM WERE OWING THOSE DREADFUL WORDS WHICH HAD CAUSED SUCH PANIC AT BARCHESTER AND HE CONCEIVED HIMSELF BOUND TO PREVENT THEIR REPETITION WITH THIS VIEW HE BETOOK HIMSELF FROM THE ATTORNEYS OFFICE
THOUGH SCORNED MEN BORN OF BRITISH MOTHERS AND NURSED ON ENGLISH MILK WHO SCRUPLE NOT TO SAY THAT MOUNT OLYMPUS HAS ITS PRICE THAT TOM TOWERS CAN BE BOUGHT FOR GOLD SUCH IS MOUNT OLYMPUS
WASHED BY THE RICH TIDE WHICH NOW PASSES FROM THE TOWERS OF CAESAR TO BARRY'S HALLS OF ELOQUENCE
OR SO COMFORTLESS AS ARE FREQUENTLY THE GAUNT ABODES OF LEGAL ASPIRANTS FOUR CHAIRS
TO WHOM WE LOOK FOR GUIDANCE IN OUR DIFFICULTIES BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO THE WRITERS OF THE JUPITER THEY HOLD COUNCIL TOGETHER AND WITH ANXIOUS THOUGHT PAINFULLY ELABORATE THEIR COUNTRY'S GOOD
AND IS STILL LOOKING FROM HOUR TO HOUR GIVES US AN IDEA OF PAIN WITHOUT GRACE AND ABSTRACTION WITHOUT A CAUSE IT WAS EASY FROM HIS ROOMS TO SEE THAT TOM TOWERS WAS A SYBARITE THOUGH BY NO MEANS AN IDLE ONE
THEN TOM TOWERS WAS STRUGGLING HARD TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF AS A BRIEFLESS BARRISTER BY SHORTHAND REPORTING FOR ANY OF THE PAPERS THAT WOULD ENGAGE HIM THEN HE HAD NOT DARED TO DREAM OF WRITING LEADERS FOR THE JUPITER
CHAPTER FOURTEEN MOUNT OLYMPUS WRETCHED IN SPIRIT GROANING UNDER THE FEELING OF INSULT SELF CONDEMNING AND ILL SATISFIED IN EVERY WAY BOLD RETURNED TO HIS LONDON LODGINGS
AND HAVE SINCE DONE OUR BEST TO AID THE COUNTESS HERE AND THEIR BEST HAS BEEN MUCH THE COUNTESS SAID NOT TO SAY HOW BRAVELY THEY HAVE FOUGHT UPON THE WALLS IT IS TO SIR JOHN AND HIS LITTLE BAND THAT I OWE IT THAT THE TOWN WAS NOT SURRENDERED DAYS AGO
AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TIE THESE TO THE ROPE IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO SLIP DOWN WITH OUR WEIGHT IF WE TIE THEM FOUR FEET APART
AND I CANNOT KEEP OPENING AND CLOSING THE GATE
THAT EVENING THERE WAS HIGH FEASTING IN THE TOWN ALTHOUGH THE CRASH OF THE HEAVY STONES CAST BY THE FRENCH MACHINES AGAINST THE WALLS NEVER CEASED EARLY THE NEXT MORNING SIR WALTER MANNY MADE A SURVEY OF THE PLACE AND OF THE DISPOSITION OF THE ENEMY
ON HIS LANDING AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN OFFERING HOSPITALITY TO THE MEN AT ARMS AND ARCHERS AH SIR JOHN POWIS SIR WALTER EXCLAIMED WHAT
IN OCTOBER KING EDWARD HIMSELF SET SAIL WITH A GREAT ARMY AND LANDING IN BRITTANY EARLY IN NOVEMBER MARCHED FORWARD THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND SOON REDUCED PLOERMEL MALESTRAIL REDON
ON THE NINETEENTH OF JANUARY THIRTEEN FORTY THREE THE KING OF FRANCE DISMISSED HIS ARMY AND EDWARD SAILED FOR ENGLAND WITH THE GREATER PART OF HIS TROOPS THE COUNTESS OF MONTFORD AND HER SON ACCOMPANIED HIM AND THE POSSESSIONS OF HER HUSBAND IN BRITTANY
NOW DOES NOTHING BUT WEEP FOR SHE KNOWS THAT WITH HER AND HER CHILD IN THE HANDS OF THE FRENCH THE CAUSE OF THE COUNT IS LOST IF SHE COULD CARRY OFF THE CHILD BY SEA SHE WOULD NOT SO MUCH CARE FOR THE FALL OF THE TOWN BUT THE FRENCH SHIPS LIE THICK ROUND THE PORT
THEY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THEIR ASSAILANTS AND DASHED IN AT THE CASTLE GATE A CROWD OF THEIR ASSAILANTS WERE CLOSE UPON THEIR HEELS WALTER GLANCED ROUND DASHING ACROSS THE COURTYARD HE RAN THROUGH SOME PASSAGES INTO AN INNER YARD IN WHICH AS HE KNEW WAS THE WELL
GAZING AS USUAL SEAWARD SUDDENLY THEY SAW HER THROW UP HER ARMS AND THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE CITY SHE CRIED AS SHE PERCEIVED THE ENGLISH KNIGHT I SEE THEM I SEE THEM THE ENGLISH FLEET ARE COMING RUN UP WALTER
AND MANY ON BOTH SIDES WERE OVERTHROWN THEN AS LARGE REINFORCEMENTS WERE CONTINUALLY ARRIVING TO THE FRENCH SIR WALTER CALLED OFF HIS MEN AND RETIRED SLOWLY ON REACHING THE MOAT HE HALTED HIS FORCES
AND PROPOSED TO HIS KNIGHTS TO SALLY FORTH AT ONCE AND DESTROY THE LARGEST OF THE ENEMY'S MACHINES WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP CLOSE TO THE WALLS IN A FEW MINUTES THE KNIGHTS WERE ARMED AND MOUNTED THREE HUNDRED KNIGHTS AND ESQUIRES WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE SORTIE
EVERY HOUSE WAS CLOSED AND BARRED AND FROM THE UPPER WINDOWS THE BURGHERS HURLED DOWN STONES AND BRICKS UPON THE FUGITIVES WHILE PARTIES OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERS FELL UPON THEM FIERCELY MANY THREW DOWN THEIR ARMS AND CRIED FOR QUARTER BUT WERE INSTANTLY SLAIN
NEARLY NINETY DAYS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE WE SAILED AND ALL HOPE OF HIS COMING IS GONE I POINT OUT TO THEM THAT CONTRARY WINDS HAVE BEEN BLOWING AND THAT AT ANY MOMENT HE MAY ARRIVE BUT THEY WILL NOT HEAR ME
THEY ALONE REMAINED STEADFAST WHEN ALL OTHERS FELL AWAY AND IT IS DUE TO THEM THAT I AM STILL ABLE AS MISTRESS OF THIS TOWN TO GREET YOU ON YOUR ARRIVAL NEXT TO SIR JOHN HIMSELF
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS WELL TO HAVE BEEN KILLED AT ONCE THEY ARE SURE TO FIND US HERE AND IF THEY DON'T WE SHALL DIE OF COLD BEFORE TOMORROW MORNING I DON'T THINK THEY WILL FIND US WALTER SAID CHEERFULLY
AND HENNEBON OF COURSE REMAINED IN THEIR POSSESSION
NO RALPH SAID MUCH MORE CHEERFULLY
AND WALKING ALL NIGHT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IT DOES NOT SUIT ME AT ALL I FEEL RAVENOUS TOO RALPH
WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIS HUNGER THE YOUNG ESQUIRE RELATED HIS ADVENTURES TO SIR WALTER AND SEVERAL OTHER KNIGHTS AND NOBLES WHO HAD BY THIS TIME GATHERED IN THE ROOM IN FAITH MASTER SOMERS
AND THEIR ENCAMPMENT WAS FLOODED THEIR FORCES WERE THEREFORE OBLIGATED TO SPREAD THEMSELVES OVER THE NEIGHBOURING FIELDS AND A SUDDEN ATTACK BY THE ENGLISH MIGHT HAVE BEEN FATAL THUS DISTRESS PRESSED UPON BOTH COMMANDERS
I HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU AND YOUR KNIGHTS SUCH A BANQUET OF WELCOME AS OUR POOR MEANS WILL ALLOW AND MY TOWNSPEOPLE WILL SEE THAT GOOD FARE IS SET BEFORE YOUR SOLDIERS
IT SLID DOWN THE ROPE WHEN THEIR WEIGHT WAS APPLIED TO IT AT LAST THEY SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT A KNOT WHICH WOULD HOLD THIS WAS DONE BY TYING A KNOT CLOSE TO ONE END OF A PIECE OF THE STRAND THEN SUFFICIENT WAS LEFT TO FORM THE LOOP
WERE LEFT TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF HER PARTISANS WITH A SMALL BUT CHOICE BODY OF ENGLISH TROOPS THE TOWNS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO THEIR HANDS AND STILL REMAINED WERE BREST QUIMPER CORENTIN QUIMPERLE REDON
BEFORE THAT TIME ELAPSED SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY PEOPLE ANXIOUS TO RETURN TO THEIR VILLAGES GATHERED ROUND THE GATE BEST LAY ASIDE YOUR STEEL CAP RALPH BEFORE WE JOIN THEM WALTER SAID IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THAT LAMP
WHEN THE TIME COMES TO BESTOW UPON YOU MYSELF THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD IF OUR KING DOES NOT TAKE THE MATTER OFF MY HANDS A LITTLE LATER ROBERT OF ARTOIS DIED OF HIS WOUNDS AND DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE FAILURE OF HIS HOPES
AND BY DINT OF UNBUCKLING THE CLOAKS AND ROLLING THEIR WEARERS GENTLY OVER WALTER SUCCEEDED AT LAST IN OBTAINING TWO OF THEM HE ALSO PICKED UP A SWORD FOR RALPH HIS OWN STILL HUNG IN ITS SHEATH AND THEN HE JOINED HIS COMPANION
TO GET AT THE WINE BUTTS TO TROUBLE THEIR HEADS ABOUT THE MATTER BESIDES IT MUST BE A HEAVY JOB TO WIND UP THIS BUCKET AND IT IS NOT LIKELY THERE WILL BE SUCH URGENT NEED OF WATER THAT ANYONE WILL UNDERTAKE THE TASK
WHO WERE FAST APPROACHING THEIR SHIPS IMPELLED BY A STRONG AND FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VESSELS OF THE FRENCH HASTILY DREW OFF AND THE ENGLISH FLEET SAILED INTO THE PORT HAILED BY THE CHEERS OF THE INHABITANTS THE COUNTESS HERSELF RECEIVED SIR WALTER MANNY
WITH HOLDING ON TO THIS ROPE THE SOONER THE BETTER SAY I IN ANOTHER MINUTE BOTH STOOD IN THE COURTYARD IT WAS A RETIRED SPOT AND NONE WERE PASSING GOING ALONG THE PASSAGE THEY ISSUED INTO THE MAIN YARD HERE GREAT FIRES WERE BLAZING
PRESENTLY THE OFFICER CAME OUT FROM THE GUARD ROOM AGAIN THERE WAS A FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE LITTLE CROWD AND WALTER AND RALPH CLOSED IN TO THEIR MIDST THE GATES WERE OPENED AND WITHOUT ANY QUESTION THE VILLAGERS PASSED OUT
AND IT WILL NOT DO FOR US TO GET TO THE TOP UNTIL THE PLACE BECOMES A LITTLE QUIET TONIGHT THEY ARE SURE TO BE DRINKING AND FEASTING OVER THEIR VICTORY UNTIL LATE THEY NOW SET TO WORK AND STEP BY STEP MOUNTED THE ROPE
AND WAS NOW WITH THE BESIEGING ARMY THE BESIEGERS DELIGHTED TO FIND AN ALLY WITHIN THE WALLS WHO MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM THE HEAVY LOSSES WHICH AN ASSAULT WOULD ENTAIL UPON THEM AT ONCE EMBRACED HIS OFFERS AND PROMISED HIM A LARGE RECOMPENSE
BESIDES THE GATES OF THE TOWN WILL STAND OPEN LATE FOR PEOPLE FROM THE VILLAGES ROUND WILL HAVE COME IN TO JOIN IN THE REVELS I AM READY TO TRY IT MASTER WALTER RALPH REPLIED FOR I ACHE FROM HEAD TO FOOT
IF I GET TIRED I WILL FASTEN ANOTHER LOOP BY THE SIDE OF THAT ON WHICH I AM RESTING SO YOU CAN COME UP AND PASS ME THERE IS NO HURRY IT OUGHT NOT TO TAKE UP ABOVE AN HOUR
THE KNIGHTS WHEELED AND PRESENTED A FIRM FACE TO THE ENEMY COVERING THE ENTRANCE OF THEIR FOLLOWERS INTO THE GATE THE FRENCH CHIVALRY THUNDERED DOWN UPON THE LITTLE BODY
AS THEY SAW THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME GREAT BREACHES WOULD BE MADE IN THE WALLS AND THAT ALL THE HORRORS AND DISASTERS OF A CITY TAKEN BY ASSAULT AWAITED THEM THE BISHOP OF QUIMPER WHO WAS WITHIN THE WALLS ENTERED INTO SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIS NEPHEW
KING EDWARD HOWEVER FELT THAT HIS POSITION WAS GROWING DESPERATE FOR STARVATION WAS STARING HIM IN THE FACE AND ONLY BY A VICTORY OVER AN IMMENSELY SUPERIOR FORCE IN A STRONGLY ENTRENCHED POSITION COULD HE EXTRICATE HIMSELF
WHO SUMMONED THE TOWN TO SURRENDER MANY STANDING ON THE WALLS SHOUTED THAT THE GATES SHOULD BE THROWN OPEN BUT SIR JOHN RETURNED FOR ANSWER THAT HE MUST CONSULT THE COUNTESS AND THAT UPON HER ANSWER MUST DEPEND WHETHER HE AND HIS MEN WOULD DEFEND THE BREACH UNTIL THE LAST
AND THE CARDINAL BISHOP OF TUSCULUM ARRIVED FROM THE POPE AND STROVE TO MEDIATE BETWEEN THE TWO SOVEREIGNS AND TO BRING ABOUT A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES POINTING OUT TO THEM
AND THE TWO PUTTING ON THE STEEL CAPS AND CLOAKS WALKED QUIETLY TO THE GATE THERE WERE NONE ON GUARD AND THEY ISSUED UNMOLESTED INTO THE TOWN
THERE WERE SIX STRANDS AND EACH HAS MADE SIX PIECES SO WE HAVE THIRTY SIX I KNOW THE WELL IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET DEEP
WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY YOU KNOW WE WILL TAKE IT BY TURNS TO WATCH THAT LITTLE PATCH OF LIGHT OVERHEAD
CHAPTER NINE THE SIEGE OF HENNEBON THE BESIEGERS OF HENNEBON WERE GREATLY DISCOURAGED AT THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE OF THE COUNTESS THEY HAD ALREADY ATTEMPTED SEVERAL DESPERATE ASSAULTS
AND THE GATES WERE SHUT INSTANTLY BEHIND THEM WALTER AND HIS COMRADE AT ONCE STARTED AT A BRISK PACE
IN A FEW DAYS THESE ARRIVED AND WERE SPEEDILY SET TO WORK AND IMMENSE MASSES OF STONE WERE HURLED AT THE WALLS WALTER CONTINUED TO ACT AS THE COUNTESS'S ESPECIAL SQUIRE SHE HAD INFORMED SIR WILLIAM CADDOUDAL
AND STOOD BY ME AND TO WHOSE SUGGESTIONS I OWE IT THAT I WAS ABLE AT THE FIRST TO SALLY OUT AND DESTROY THE FRENCH CAMP WHILE THEY WERE ATTACKING THE WALLS AND SO GREATLY HINDERED THEIR MEASURES AGAINST THE TOWN AND NOW SIR WILL YOU FOLLOW ME
THEN TURNING OFF FROM THE PRINCIPAL STREETS THEY MADE THEIR WAY BY QUIET LANES DOWN TO ONE OF THE GATES TO THEIR DISMAY THEY FOUND THAT THIS WAS CLOSED THE FRENCH COMMANDERS KNEW THAT SIR WALTER MANNY OR SALISBURY
WHO COMMANDED THE GARRISON OF VANNES SUPPORTED THE SIEGE WITH GREAT COURAGE AND FORTITUDE KNOWING THAT CHARLES OF BLOIS AND THE KING OF FRANCE WERE COLLECTING A GREAT ARMY FOR HIS RELIEF UNITING THEIR FORCES THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS THE TOWN
BY WHICH IT WOULD NOT SLIP DOWN THE ROPE THEY MADE MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS
AND FORMED A LARGE ENTRENCHED CAMP NEAR THAT OF THE ENGLISH WHO THUS WHILE STILL BESIEGING VANNES WERE THEMSELVES ENCLOSED BY A VASTLY SUPERIOR FORCE THE KING OF FRANCE HIMSELF ARRIVED AT THE FRENCH CAMP THE FRENCH ALTHOUGH SO GREATLY SUPERIOR
WE SHALL EAT NOTHING TILL WE ARE WITHIN THE WALLS OF HENNEBON AND THAT WILL BE BY DAYLIGHT TOMORROW IF ALL GOES WELL DRAW YOUR BELT AN INCH OR TWO TIGHTER IT WILL HELP TO KEEP OUT THE WOLF
SLAYING ALL WHOM THEY ENCOUNTERED ALL IS LOST SIR JOHN EXCLAIMED LET US FALL BACK TO THE CASTLE AND DIE FIGHTING THERE DESCENDING FROM THE WALL THE PARTY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE STREETS THE FRENCH WERE ALREADY IN THE TOWN
THE BISHOP HAS GAINED OVER THE WHOLE OF THEM BY HIS PROMISES THAT NONE SHALL BE MOLESTED IN PROPERTY OR ESTATE SHOULD THEY SURRENDER IT IS SAD TO SEE THE COUNTESS WALTER REPLIED SHE WHO HAS SHOWN SUCH HIGH SPIRIT THROUGHOUT THE SIEGE
YOU ARE DOING WELL YOUNG SIR THE ENGLISH LEADER WENT ON AND HAVE DISTINGUISHED YOURSELF ON EACH OCCASION ON WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED I SHALL BE PROUD
SOME TRIED IN VAIN TO GAIN SHELTER IN THE HOUSES SIR JOHN POWIS'S BAND WAS SOON BROKEN AND SCATTERED AND THEIR LEADER SLAIN BY A HEAVY STONE FROM A HOUSETOP WALTER FOUGHT HIS WAY BLINDLY FORWARD TOWARDS THE CASTLE
TO RECONNOITRE THE COUNTRY AND CLEAR IT OF ANY SMALL BODIES OF THE ENEMY THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER IN THE MEANTIME EDWARD OPENED NEGOTIATIONS WITH MANY OF THE BRETON LORDS
THAT SOME FOOD BE PLACED BEFORE US OR WE SHALL HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE FRENCH ONLY TO DIE OF HUNGER HERE WE HAVE TASTED NOUGHT SINCE THE ATTACK ON VANNES BEGAN HAVE ANY BESIDE US ESCAPED
THEN THOUGH IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING THEY HEARD THE BUCKET LIFTED FROM THE WATER A MINUTE LATER IT FELL BACK AGAIN WITH A SPLASH
ORDERED HIS HEAD TO BE CUT OFF AFTER HIM CAME SEVERAL OTHERS
BUT GINGER WHO KNEW MORE OF HER THAN I DID TOLD ME SHE WAS RATHER NERVOUS
AND SHE CRIED OUT TO HER SISTERS ALL IS NOT RIGHT
I AM NOT VERY YOUNG SO I WILL HAVE THE ELDEST AND THEY WERE MARRIED THAT VERY DAY
SOMETIMES WITH GINGER SOMETIMES WITH LIZZIE THIS LIZZIE WAS A BRIGHT BAY MARE ALMOST THOROUGHBRED AND A GREAT FAVORITE WITH THE GENTLEMEN ON ACCOUNT OF HER FINE ACTION AND LIVELY SPIRIT
THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES THERE WAS A KING WHO HAD TWELVE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS THEY SLEPT IN TWELVE BEDS ALL IN ONE ROOM AND WHEN THEY WENT TO BED THE DOORS WERE SHUT
JUST AS WE WERE MOVING OFF A FOOTMAN CAME OUT WITH A SLIP OF PAPER
AGAIN AND AGAIN I NEIGHED PAWING THE GROUND IMPATIENTLY AND TOSSING MY HEAD TO GET THE REIN LOOSE I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BLANTYRE CAME RUNNING TO THE GATE HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY ABOUT
AND LEANING A LITTLE FORWARD WE DASHED AFTER THEM FOR ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF THE ROAD RAN STRAIGHT AND THEN BENT TO THE RIGHT AFTER WHICH IT DIVIDED INTO TWO ROADS
SHE WAS UNCOMMON GOOD TO MY WIFE IN THE WINTER THEN MOUNT THIS HORSE MY FRIEND YOUR NECK WILL BE QUITE SAFE AND RIDE TO THE DOCTOR'S AND ASK HIM TO COME INSTANTLY
AT ONCE THE LITTLE HAND WAS PATTING ABOUT ALL OVER MY SHOULDER WITHOUT FEAR HOW GOOD IT FELT LET ME GET HIM A BRAN MASH WHILE YOU RUB HIM DOWN SAID THE MOTHER DO POLLY IT'S JUST WHAT HE WANTS
YOU SILLY CREATURE SAID THE ELDEST IT IS NOTHING BUT A NAIL IN THE WALL THEN DOWN THEY ALL WENT AND AT THE BOTTOM THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A MOST DELIGHTFUL GROVE OF TREES AND THE LEAVES WERE ALL OF SILVER
HUMMING A LITTLE SONG I LISTENED TO MY RIDER'S FOOTSTEPS UNTIL THEY REACHED THE HOUSE AND HEARD HIM KNOCK AT THE DOOR THERE WAS A MEADOW ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE GATE OF WHICH STOOD OPEN
SHE WAS A PERFECT HORSEWOMAN AND AS GAY AND GENTLE AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL SHE CHOSE ME FOR HER HORSE AND NAMED ME BLACK AUSTER I ENJOYED THESE RIDES VERY MUCH IN THE CLEAR COLD AIR
HE DETERMINED TO TRY HIS LUCK SO HE WENT TO THE KING AND SAID HE WAS WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THE TASK HE WAS AS WELL RECEIVED AS THE OTHERS HAD BEEN AND THE KING ORDERED FINE ROYAL ROBES TO BE GIVEN HIM
NO NO HE SAID I'LL BE BACK TO EM AGAIN BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE FIELDS
THE LADY ANNE OR A RUNAWAY HORSE EARLY IN THE SPRING LORD W AND PART OF HIS FAMILY WENT UP TO LONDON AND TOOK YORK WITH THEM
AND WITH ONE DETERMINED LEAP CLEARED BOTH DIKE AND BANK MOTIONLESS AMONG THE HEATHER WITH HER FACE TO THE EARTH
TALKING TO HIMSELF AND TALKING TO ME HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO LONDON THROUGH PLEASANT LANES AND COUNTRY ROADS UNTIL WE CAME INTO THE GREAT LONDON THOROUGHFARE ON WHICH WE TRAVELED STEADILY
I HARDLY KNOW WHERE I AM GOING OR WHAT I HAD BETTER DO SAID THE SOLDIER BUT I THINK I SHOULD LIKE VERY WELL TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS THAT THE PRINCESSES DANCE AND THEN IN TIME I MIGHT BE A KING WELL SAID THE OLD DAME
AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE COACH HOUSES AND STABLES ON THE OTHER MY OWNER PULLED UP AT ONE OF THE HOUSES AND WHISTLED THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A YOUNG WOMAN FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE GIRL AND BOY RAN OUT
TO THE COMMON TO THE COMMON SIR SHE HAS TURNED OFF THERE I KNEW THIS COMMON VERY WELL IT WAS FOR THE MOST PART VERY UNEVEN GROUND COVERED WITH HEATHER AND DARK GREEN FURZE BUSHES
AND NOT ANOTHER SIXPENCE YES OR NO DONE SAID THE SALESMAN AND YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THERE'S A MONSTROUS DEAL OF QUALITY IN THAT HORSE AND IF YOU WANT HIM FOR CAB WORK HE'S A BARGAIN
HIS SHOVEL DROPPED AND HIS HANDS RAISED AS WE CAME NEAR HE MADE A SIGN TO SPEAK
THEN FEEL ALL THE WAY DOWN MY LEGS AND GIVE ME A HARD FEEL OF THE SKIN AND FLESH AND THEN TRY MY PACES IT WAS WONDERFUL WHAT A DIFFERENCE THERE WAS IN THE WAY THESE THINGS WERE DONE SOME DID IT IN A ROUGH OFFHAND WAY AS IF
ANOTHER BEND AND SHE WAS HIDDEN AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES WE CAUGHT GLIMPSES AND THEN LOST THEM WE SCARCELY SEEMED TO GAIN GROUND UPON THEM AT ALL AN OLD ROAD MENDER WAS STANDING NEAR A HEAP OF STONES
TWO DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT BLANTYRE PAID ME A VISIT HE PATTED ME AND PRAISED ME VERY MUCH HE TOLD LORD GEORGE THAT HE WAS SURE THE HORSE KNEW OF ANNIE'S DANGER AS WELL AS HE DID
AT LAST IN PASSING THROUGH ONE WE CAME TO A LONG CAB STAND WHEN MY RIDER CALLED OUT IN A CHEERY VOICE GOOD NIGHT GOVERNOR HALLOO CRIED A VOICE HAVE YOU GOT A GOOD ONE I THINK SO REPLIED MY OWNER
LOOSENED HER COLLAR FELT HER HANDS AND WRIST THEN STARTED UP AND LOOKED WILDLY ROUND HIM FOR HELP AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE WERE TWO MEN CUTTING TURF WHO SEEING LIZZIE RUNNING WILD WITHOUT A RIDER
BEGAN TO THINK HE SHOULD NOT GET ALL HE ASKED AND MUST COME DOWN BUT JUST THEN THE GRAY EYED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN I COULD NOT HELP REACHING OUT MY HEAD TOWARD HIM HE STROKED MY FACE KINDLY
AND A GOOD MANY LIKE MYSELF HANDSOME AND HIGH BRED
WITH LADY ANNE'S MAID AND HELP I SHALL STAY HERE ALL RIGHT SIR
BUT MY PACE SOON CURED THAT DIFFICULTY AND HE FOUND THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO STICK TO THE SADDLE AND HOLD ME IN WHICH HE DID MANFULLY I SHOOK HIM AS LITTLE AS I COULD HELP BUT ONCE OR TWICE
TILL WE CAME TO HIS GATE THERE WAS A SHORT DRIVE UP TO THE HOUSE BETWEEN TALL EVERGREENS BLANTYRE ALIGHTED AT THE GATE AND WAS GOING TO OPEN IT FOR LADY ANNE BUT SHE SAID I WILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE
AND I HAVE FOLLOWED THE HOUNDS A GREAT MANY TIMES THOUGH I KNOW YOU DO NOT APPROVE OF LADIES HUNTING BUT STILL THAT IS THE FACT AND I INTEND TO TRY THIS LIZZIE
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN HOW MANY KINGS SONS HAVE ALREADY WATCHED IN VAIN AND AS FOR THIS SOLDIER EVEN IF I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM HIS SLEEPING DRAUGHT
NO SMELL OF OLD BEER AND TOBACCO WHICH I HATED BUT A FRESH SMELL AS IF HE HAD COME OUT OF A HAYLOFT HE OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS FOR ME BUT THAT WAS REFUSED AND HE WALKED AWAY
THEN HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN ON HIS BED AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE GINGER CAME BACK AND BEFORE WE WERE LEFT ALONE AND THEN SHE TOLD ME ALL THAT SHE HAD SEEN I CAN'T TELL MUCH SHE SAID WE WENT A GALLOP NEARLY ALL THE WAY
THE ELDEST LEADING THE WAY AND THINKING HE HAD NO TIME TO LOSE HE JUMPED UP PUT ON THE CLOAK WHICH THE OLD WOMAN HAD GIVEN HIM AND FOLLOWED THEM BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAIRS HE TROD ON THE GOWN OF THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
I WISH YOU LUCK WITH HIM THANK YOU GOVERNOR AND HE RODE ON WE SOON TURNED UP ONE OF THE SIDE STREETS AND ABOUT HALFWAY UP THAT WE TURNED INTO A VERY NARROW STREET WITH RATHER POOR LOOKING HOUSES ON ONE SIDE
AND IF A HORSE MAY SPEAK HIS MIND SO FAR AS HE UNDERSTANDS I SHOULD SAY THERE WERE MORE LIES TOLD AND MORE TRICKERY AT THAT HORSE FAIR
LONG BEFORE WE CAME TO THE BEND SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH WAY HAD SHE TURNED A WOMAN WAS STANDING AT HER GARDEN GATE SHADING HER EYES WITH HER HAND AND LOOKING EAGERLY UP THE ROAD
THERE HAD BEEN A WIDE DIKE RECENTLY CUT AND THE EARTH FROM THE CUTTING WAS CAST UP ROUGHLY ON THE OTHER SIDE SURELY THIS WOULD STOP THEM BUT NO WITH SCARCELY A PAUSE LIZZIE TOOK THE LEAP
TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AFTER AWHILE SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE CARRIAGE AND WE CAME HOME TOGETHER I HEARD MY MASTER SAY TO A GENTLEMAN WHO STOPPED HIM TO INQUIRE THAT HE HOPED NO BONES WERE BROKEN BUT THAT SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN YET
BUT THE YOUNGEST SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS WHILE YOU ARE SO HAPPY I FEEL VERY UNEASY I AM SURE SOME MISCHANCE WILL BEFALL US YOU SIMPLETON SAID THE ELDEST YOU ARE ALWAYS AFRAID
WAS TAKEN TO THE CHAMBER NEXT TO THE ONE WHERE THE PRINCESSES LAY IN THEIR TWELVE BEDS THERE HE WAS TO SIT AND WATCH WHERE THEY WENT TO DANCE AND IN ORDER THAT NOTHING MIGHT PASS WITHOUT HIS HEARING IT THE DOOR OF HIS CHAMBER WAS LEFT OPEN
AND THE SOLDIER BROKE A BRANCH FROM EACH AND EVERY TIME THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE WHICH MADE THE YOUNGEST SISTER TREMBLE WITH FEAR BUT THE ELDEST STILL SAID IT WAS ONLY THE PRINCES WHO WERE CRYING FOR JOY
THERE WERE ALSO OPEN SPACES OF FINE SHORT GRASS WITH ANT HILLS AND MOLE TURNS EVERYWHERE
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE STAIRS THE SOLDIER RAN ON BEFORE THE PRINCESSES AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND AS THE TWELVE SISTERS SLOWLY CAME UP VERY MUCH TIRED THEY HEARD HIM SNORING IN HIS BED SO THEY SAID
STAYING AT THE HALL HE ALWAYS RODE LIZZIE AND PRAISED HER SO MUCH THAT ONE DAY LADY ANNE ORDERED THE SIDE SADDLE TO BE PUT ON HER AND THE OTHER SADDLE ON ME WHEN WE CAME TO THE DOOR THE GENTLEMAN SEEMED VERY UNEASY
THAT IF ANY PERSON COULD DISCOVER THE SECRET AND FIND OUT WHERE IT WAS THAT THE PRINCESSES DANCED IN THE NIGHT HE SHOULD HAVE THE ONE HE LIKED BEST FOR HIS WIFE AND SHOULD BE KING AFTER HIS DEATH
AND WAS SOON HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES LIZZIE WAS STANDING QUIETLY BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A FEW PACES OFF WITH HER BACK TO ME MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS SITTING EASILY WITH A LOOSE REIN
BUT THE KING'S SON SOON FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE IN THE MORNING HE FOUND THAT THE PRINCESSES HAD ALL BEEN DANCING FOR THE SOLES OF THEIR SHOES WERE FULL OF HOLES THE SAME THING HAPPENED THE SECOND AND THIRD NIGHT SO THE KING
BUT NOW WITH A LIGHT HAND AND A PRACTICED EYE HE GUIDED ME OVER THE GROUND IN SUCH A MASTERLY MANNER THAT MY PACE WAS SCARCELY SLACKENED AND WE WERE DECIDEDLY GAINING ON THEM
HOW IS THIS HE SAID ARE YOU TIRED OF YOUR GOOD BLACK AUSTER OH NO NOT AT ALL SHE REPLIED BUT I AM AMIABLE ENOUGH TO LET YOU RIDE HIM FOR ONCE
WE HAD HARDLY TURNED ON THE COMMON WHEN WE CAUGHT SIGHT AGAIN OF THE GREEN HABIT FLYING ON BEFORE US MY LADY'S HAT WAS GONE AND HER LONG BROWN HAIR WAS STREAMING BEHIND HER HER HEAD AND BODY WERE THROWN BACK
THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE WERE TAKEN OFF AND A CLOTH THROWN OVER ME GINGER WAS SADDLED AND SENT OFF IN GREAT HASTE FOR LORD GEORGE AND I SOON HEARD THE CARRIAGE ROLL OUT OF THE YARD
THE SOLDIER PLACED HIMSELF IN THE BOAT WITH THE ELDEST PRINCESS AND ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE THEY TOOK LEAVE OF EACH OTHER THE PRINCESSES PROMISING TO COME AGAIN THE NEXT NIGHT
AND GLITTERED AND SPARKLED BEAUTIFULLY THE SOLDIER WISHED TO TAKE AWAY SOME TOKEN OF THE PLACE SO HE BROKE OFF A LITTLE BRANCH AND THERE CAME A LOUD NOISE FROM THE TREE THEN THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SAID AGAIN
HIS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE STOOD HIM IN GOOD STEAD THERE IT WAS A VERY COMPLETE LITTLE OUTFIT
SAVAGE DIALECTS STUDIED AND ALL MANNER OF STRANGE FLORA AND FAUNA EXPECTED BUT THIS STORY IS NOT ABOUT THAT EXPEDITION THAT WAS ONLY THE MEREST STARTER FOR OURS
A SORT OF WEDDING CALL THIS IS A CONDITION KNOWN TO HAVE EXISTED HERE'S JUST A SURVIVAL
BUT TERRY STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS LOOK HERE FELLOWS HE SAID THIS IS OUR FIND LET'S NOT TELL THOSE COCKY OLD PROFESSORS LET'S GO ON HOME WITH EM AND THEN COME BACK JUST US HAVE A LITTLE EXPEDITION OF OUR OWN WE LOOKED AT HIM MUCH IMPRESSED
THE REST OF THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT THAT COUNTRY I HAVEN'T SAID WHERE IT WAS FOR FEAR SOME SELF APPOINTED MISSIONARIES OR TRADERS OR LAND GREEDY EXPANSIONISTS WILL TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO PUSH IN THEY WILL NOT BE WANTED I CAN TELL THEM THAT
AND WE HAD TO GET BACK TO OUR PARTY BEFORE NIGHT
THOSE NATIVES CAN'T GET INTO IT OR HURT IT OR MOVE IT TERRY EXPLAINED PROUDLY WE'LL START OUR FLIER FROM THE LAKE AND LEAVE THE BOAT AS A BASE TO COME BACK TO IF WE COME BACK I SUGGESTED CHEERFULLY FRAID THE LADIES WILL EAT YOU HE SCOFFED
IT WAS REALLY UNPLEASANT SOMETIMES TO SEE THE NOTIONS HE HAD BUT I GOT OUT OF PATIENCE WITH JEFF TOO HE HAD SUCH ROSE COLORED HALOS ON HIS WOMENFOLKS
I COULD SEE TERRY'S JAW SET AT THAT NO PLACE FOR MEN DANGEROUS HE LOOKED AS IF HE MIGHT SHIN UP THE WATERFALL ON THE SPOT BUT THE GUIDE WOULD NOT HEAR OF GOING UP EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY POSSIBLE METHOD OF SCALING THAT SHEER CLIFF
WE CAME AFTER A WHILE TO A SORT OF MARSHY LAKE VERY BIG SO THAT THE CIRCLING FOREST LOOKED QUITE LOW AND DIM ACROSS IT OUR GUIDE TOLD US THAT BOATS COULD GO FROM THERE TO OUR CAMP BUT LONG WAY ALL DAY
HE REFUSED TO LISTEN TO JEFF'S SUGGESTION THAT WE EXAMINE THE COUNTRY FURTHER BEFORE WE RISKED LEAVING OUR MACHINE
HE BROKE OFF YOU'RE RIGHT TERRY ONCE THE STORY GETS OUT THE RIVER WILL CRAWL WITH EXPEDITIONS AND THE AIRSHIPS RISE LIKE A SWARM OF MOSQUITOES I LAUGHED AS I THOUGHT OF IT WE'VE MADE A GREAT MISTAKE NOT TO LET MISTER YELLOW PRESS IN ON THIS SAVE US
THEY HEARD OUR WHIRRING SCREW THEY RAN OUT OF THE HOUSES THEY GATHERED IN FROM THE FIELDS SWIFT RUNNING LIGHT FIGURES CROWDS OF THEM WE STARED AND STARED UNTIL IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE TO CATCH THE LEVERS SWEEP OFF AND RISE AGAIN
FIRST TIE YOUR CAMEL AND THEN TRUST IN THE LORD JEFF MURMURED SO WE ALL HAD OUR WEAPONS IN HAND AND STOLE CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE FOREST TERRY STUDIED IT AS WE PROGRESSED TALK OF CIVILIZATION
BUT T O NICHOLSON COULD FIX UP HIS BIG STEAM YACHT LOAD HIS SPECIALLY MADE BIG MOTORBOAT ABOARD AND TUCK IN A DISSEMBLED BIPLANE WITHOUT ANY MORE NOTICE THAN A SNIP IN THE SOCIETY COLUMN WE HAD PROVISIONS AND PREVENTIVES AND ALL MANNER OF SUPPLIES
BUT WE COULD NOT HELP SEEING THIS MUCH EVEN ON THAT EXCITED DAY A LAND IN A STATE OF PERFECT CULTIVATION WHERE EVEN THE FORESTS LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE CARED FOR A LAND THAT LOOKED LIKE AN ENORMOUS PARK
WE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY FOR OVER A YEAR HARDLY BELIEVING THAT THERE WAS SUCH A PLACE AND NOW WE WERE IN IT
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US IN COLLEGE DAYS WAS QUITE PLEASED TO HAVE HIM WITH OUR SISTERS WE WEREN'T VERY STRINGENT HEAVENS NO BUT TERRY WAS THE LIMIT LATER ON WHY OF COURSE A MAN'S LIFE IS HIS OWN
NO YOU'LL HAVE TO BE BEHEADED OR BOWSTRUNG OR WHATEVER THE POPULAR METHOD OF EXECUTION IS YOU'D HAVE TO DO IT YOURSELF REMEMBER GRINNED JEFF NO HUSKY BLACK SLAVES AND MAMELUKES
HE SUGGESTED BY SIGNS THAT WE ALL GO DOWN TOGETHER BUT AGAIN THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS STILL MERRILY THEN ELLADOR CLEARLY INDICATED THAT WE SHOULD GO DOWN POINTING TO EACH AND ALL OF US WITH UNMISTAKABLE FIRMNESS AND FURTHER
AND IT WAS NAVIGABLE AS FAR AS THE LAKE WHEN WE REACHED THAT AND SLID OUT ON ITS BROAD GLISTENING BOSOM WITH THAT HIGH GRAY PROMONTORY RUNNING OUT TOWARD US AND THE STRAIGHT WHITE FALL CLEARLY VISIBLE IT BEGAN TO BE REALLY EXCITING
AND FROM WHAT WE COULD SEE OF THE SIDES AND THAT ICY RIDGE AT THE BACK END
AND SEE THE BROAD FAIR LAND AT OUR PLEASURE SEMITROPICAL
A LITTLE HAPPY SOUND INSTANTLY SMOTHERED WE STOOD LIKE SO MANY POINTERS AND THEN USED OUR GLASSES SWIFTLY CAREFULLY
DIDN'T HAPPEN SHE MADE A TIMID REACH WITH HER RIGHT HAND FOR THE GAY SWINGING THING HE HELD IT A LITTLE NEARER THEN SWIFT AS LIGHT SHE SEIZED IT FROM HIM WITH HER LEFT AND DROPPED ON THE INSTANT TO THE BOUGH BELOW HE MADE HIS SNATCH QUITE VAINLY
OH CLOTH WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SPINSTERS BUT THERE THEY STOP YOU'LL SEE WE JOKED TERRY ABOUT HIS MODEST IMPRESSION THAT HE WOULD BE WARMLY RECEIVED BUT HE HELD HIS GROUND YOU'LL SEE HE INSISTED
LET'S GO URGED TERRY JUST US THREE MAYBE WE CAN REALLY FIND SOMETHING MAY BE CINNABAR IN IT MAY BE INDIGO JEFF SUGGESTED WITH HIS LAZY SMILE IT WAS EARLY YET WE HAD JUST BREAKFASTED
THEY NEEDED A DOCTOR AND THAT GAVE JEFF AN EXCUSE FOR DROPPING HIS JUST OPENING PRACTICE THEY NEEDED TERRY'S EXPERIENCE HIS MACHINE AND HIS MONEY AND AS FOR ME I GOT IN THROUGH TERRY'S INFLUENCE
LOOKING AT THE LONG BLUE ROLLERS SLIPPING BY AND FINGERING THAT IMPRESSIVE MUSTACHE OF HIS BUT I THOUGHT THEN THAT I COULD FORM A FAR CLEARER IDEA OF WHAT WAS BEFORE US THAN EITHER OF THEM YOU'RE ALL OFF BOYS I INSISTED
WE HAD OUR GLASSES OUT EVEN TERRY
THE EXPEDITION WAS UP AMONG THE THOUSAND TRIBUTARIES AND ENORMOUS HINTERLAND OF A GREAT RIVER
WITH YOUR TREMENDOUS SPEED WE CAN REACH THAT RANGE AND BACK ALL RIGHT THEN WE CAN LEAVE A SORT OF
BUT THERE WERE TALES OF LONG AGO WHEN SOME BRAVE INVESTIGATOR HAD SEEN IT A BIG COUNTRY BIG HOUSES PLENTY PEOPLE ALL WOMEN HAD NO ONE ELSE GONE
OFFERED IT FIRST TO ONE THEN TO ANOTHER HOLDING IT OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH TOWARD THE GIRL NEAREST HIM HE STOOD BRACED IN THE FORK HELD FIRMLY BY ONE HAND THE OTHER SWINGING HIS BRIGHT TEMPTATION REACHED FAR OUT ALONG THE BOUGH
WE SCRAMBLED ALONG THE STEEP BANKS AND GOT CLOSE TO THE POOL THAT FOAMED AND BOILED BENEATH THE FALLING WATER HERE WE SEARCHED THE BORDER AND FOUND TRACES OF COLOR BEYOND DISPUTE MORE JEFF SUDDENLY HELD UP AN UNLOOKED FOR TROPHY
THERE IS NO SUCH CLOTH MADE BY ANY OF THESE LOCAL TRIBES I ANNOUNCED EXAMINING THOSE RAGS WITH GREAT CARE SOMEWHERE UP YONDER THEY SPIN AND WEAVE AND DYE AS WELL AS WE DO THAT WOULD MEAN A CONSIDERABLE CIVILIZATION VAN
WITH CIRCLING SEATS BENEATH LOOK HE PURSUED THERE ARE SHORT STUMPS OF BRANCHES LEFT TO CLIMB ON THERE'S SOMEONE UP THAT TREE I BELIEVE WE STOLE NEAR CAUTIOUSLY
CHAPTER ONE A NOT UNNATURAL ENTERPRISE THIS IS WRITTEN FROM MEMORY UNFORTUNATELY IF I COULD HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME THE MATERIAL I SO CAREFULLY PREPARED THIS WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT STORY
THE SAME TASTE I HAPPENED TO SPEAK OF THAT RIVER TO OUR LAST GUIDE A RATHER SUPERIOR FELLOW WITH QUICK BRIGHT EYES HE TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER RIVER OVER THERE SHORT RIVER SWEET WATER RED AND BLUE
IT WAS ONLY A RAG A LONG RAVELED FRAGMENT OF CLOTH BUT IT WAS A WELL WOVEN FABRIC WITH A PATTERN AND OF A CLEAR SCARLET THAT THE WATER HAD NOT FADED
WE'LL LEAVE PAPERS WITH OUR CONSUL WHERE THE YACHT STAYS TERRY PLANNED
AND WILL FARE WORSE THAN WE DID IF THEY DO FIND IT IT BEGAN THIS WAY THERE WERE THREE OF US CLASSMATES AND FRIENDS TERRY O NICHOLSON
BUT AS TO BEING RED AND BLUE IT WAS GREENISH IN TINT THE GUIDE SEEMED NOT AT ALL SURPRISED HE HUNTED ABOUT A LITTLE AND SHOWED US A QUIET MARGINAL POOL WHERE THERE WERE SMEARS OF RED ALONG THE BORDER YES AND OF BLUE
ONLY IT WAS EVEN MORE EVIDENTLY AN ENORMOUS GARDEN
HIS GREAT AIM WAS EXPLORATION HE USED TO MAKE ALL KINDS OF A ROW BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO EXPLORE NOW ONLY PATCHWORK AND FILLING IN HE SAID HE FILLED IN WELL ENOUGH HE HAD A LOT OF TALENTS GREAT ON MECHANICS AND ELECTRICITY
AND PUMPED THE MAN FOR FURTHER INFORMATION HE COULD TELL US ONLY WHAT THE OTHERS HAD A LAND OF WOMEN NO MEN BABIES BUT ALL GIRLS NO PLACE FOR MEN DANGEROUS SOME HAD GONE TO SEE NONE HAD COME BACK
OF COURSE WE DIDN'T BELIEVE THE STORY
WELL TERRY WAS POPULAR AMONG WOMEN EVEN WHEN THERE WERE OTHER MEN AROUND AND IT'S NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT HE HAD PLEASANT DREAMS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN I COULD SEE IT IN HIS EYES AS HE LAY THERE
THERE AMONG THE BOUGHS OVERHEAD WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN ONE SOMETHING THAT CLUNG MOTIONLESS CLOSE TO THE GREAT TRUNK AT FIRST AND THEN AS ONE AND ALL WE STARTED UP THE TREE
AND IT WAS AN EXCELLENT ONE A WIDE FLAT TOPPED ROCK OVERLOOKING THE LAKE AND QUITE OUT OF SIGHT FROM THE INTERIOR THEY WON'T FIND THIS IN A HURRY HE ASSERTED AS WE SCRAMBLED WITH THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY DOWN TO SAFER FOOTING COME ON BOYS THERE WERE SOME GOOD LOOKERS IN THAT BUNCH OF COURSE
AND FRUIT GATHERERS BUT AN AIRSHIP IS A CONSPICUOUS OBJECT AND BY NO MEANS QUIET AND WOMEN ARE CAUTIOUS
THAT THERE WAS THIS STRANGE COUNTRY WHERE NO MEN LIVED ONLY WOMEN AND GIRL CHILDREN NONE OF THEM HAD EVER SEEN IT IT WAS DANGEROUS DEADLY THEY SAID FOR ANY MAN TO GO THERE
IT WAS QUITE EASY TO SEE AFTERWARD THAT OUR BEST PLAN WAS TO HAVE STUDIED THE COUNTRY MORE FULLY BEFORE WE LEFT OUR SWOOPING AIRSHIP AND TRUSTED OURSELVES TO MERE FOOT SERVICE BUT WE WERE THREE YOUNG MEN
SO WE JOKED AND DISPUTED AND SPECULATED AND AFTER AN INTERMINABLE JOURNEY WE GOT TO OUR OLD CAMPING PLACE AT LAST
ON THE OCEAN VOYAGE AND THE RIVER VOYAGE TOO ADMITTING THE IMPROBABILITY WE'D BEGIN SOLEMNLY AND THEN LAUNCH OUT AGAIN THEY WOULD FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES TERRY INSISTED WOMEN ALWAYS DO
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TERRY REMARKED DRILY GO YOU'LL HAVE TO GET AN INJUNCTION TO STOP ME BOTH JEFF AND I WERE SURE ABOUT THAT BUT
I TOLD HIM TERRY BLAZED UP AT ONCE ASK HIM HOW FAR IT IS THE MAN INDICATED A SHORT JOURNEY I JUDGED ABOUT TWO HOURS MAYBE THREE
WHAT HEADLINES NOT MUCH SAID TERRY GRIMLY THIS IS OUR PARTY WE'RE GOING TO FIND THAT PLACE ALONE
WHOLE BOOKS FULL OF NOTES CAREFULLY COPIED RECORDS FIRSTHAND DESCRIPTIONS AND THE PICTURES THAT'S THE WORST LOSS WE HAD SOME BIRD'S EYES OF THE CITIES AND PARKS
I SUGGESTED BUT TERRY WAS SILENT WE WERE APPROACHING A VILLAGE I CONFESS THAT WE PAID SMALL ATTENTION TO THE CLEAN WELL BUILT ROADS TO THE ATTRACTIVE ARCHITECTURE TO THE ORDERED BEAUTY OF THE LITTLE TOWN
AND AS WE GOT FARTHER AND FARTHER UPSTREAM IN A DARK TANGLE OF RIVERS LAKES MORASSES AND DENSE FORESTS WITH HERE AND THERE AN UNEXPECTED LONG SPUR RUNNING OUT FROM THE BIG MOUNTAINS BEYOND I NOTICED THAT MORE AND MORE OF THESE SAVAGES HAD A STORY
THEN SOFTLY AND SLOWLY SHE DREW NEARER THIS WAS ALIMA A TALL LONG LIMBED LASS WELL KNIT AND EVIDENTLY BOTH STRONG AND AGILE HER EYES WERE SPLENDID WIDE FEARLESS
AS BRIGHT AND SMOOTH AS PARROTS AND AS UNAWARE OF DANGER THEY SWUNG THERE BEFORE US WHOLLY AT EASE STARING AS WE STARED TILL FIRST ONE AND THEN ALL OF THEM BURST INTO PEALS OF DELIGHTED LAUGHTER
A FINE CHEST HE HAD TOO AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF HE WAS BRACED CAREFULLY FOR THE OCCASION AND ACHIEVED AN EXCELLENT OBEISANCE AGAIN THEY LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY AND THE ONE NEAREST ME FOLLOWED HIS TACTICS
UNTIL THE VERY TIDE OF THE RIVER ON THE BANK OF WHICH THE MAD SCENE WAS ACTED SEEMED TO RUN MAD LIKE THE PEOPLE ON THE SHORE THEY PUT HIM INTO A GREAT CHAIR THEY HAD AMONG THEM
LET ME THANK GOD FOR THIS ON MY KNEES AS I HAVE PRAYED TO HIM THEY ALL REVERENTLY BOWED THEIR HEADS AND HEARTS WHEN SHE WAS AGAIN IN HIS ARMS HE SAID TO HER
EVERY HUMAN CREATURE HE HAD SINCE CARED FOR AND PARTED WITH HAD DIED ON THE SCAFFOLD THERE WERE HURRIED WORDS OF FAREWELL AND KINDNESS BUT THE PARTING WAS SOON OVER IT WAS THE INCIDENT OF EVERY DAY
THEN BEGAN ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WITH WHICH THE POPULACE SOMETIMES GRATIFIED THEIR FICKLENESS OR THEIR BETTER IMPULSES TOWARDS GENEROSITY AND MERCY
BY THIS TIME THE DOCTOR HAD PICKED HIMSELF UP AND ON THEY WENT AGAIN RUNNING AND RUNNING AND CHEE CHEE SHOUTED IT'S ALL RIGHT WE HAVEN'T FAR TO GO NOW
AND WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD UPON HIS FEET SHE DROPPED INSENSIBLE IN HIS ARMS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS HEART AND TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD BETWEEN HIS FACE AND THE BRAWLING CROWD
ARE YOU NOT CARRIED A LITTLE TOO FAR WOULD HE THANK YOU EITHER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT OR MISS THORPE'S FOR SUPPOSING THAT HER AFFECTION OR AT LEAST HER GOOD BEHAVIOUR IS ONLY TO BE SECURED BY HER SEEING NOTHING OF CAPTAIN TILNEY
OR WHICH THEY REGARDED AS SOME SET OFF AGAINST THEIR SWOLLEN ACCOUNT OF CRUEL RAGE NO MAN CAN DECIDE NOW TO WHICH OF THESE MOTIVES SUCH EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WERE REFERABLE IT IS PROBABLE TO A BLENDING OF ALL THE THREE
BUT WHAT HE MOST NOTICED IN THE TWO FIGURES WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE POSTED AS CLOSE TO HIMSELF AS THEY COULD BE THEY NEVER LOOKED TOWARDS HIM THEY SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR SOMETHING WITH A DOGGED DETERMINATION
HE HAD COME BACK TO SAVE A CITIZEN'S LIFE AND TO BEAR HIS TESTIMONY AT WHATEVER PERSONAL HAZARD TO THE TRUTH WAS THAT CRIMINAL IN THE EYES OF THE REPUBLIC THE POPULACE CRIED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
AND HE LED THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS TO THE VERY THICKEST PART OF THE FOREST A PLACE WHERE NO MAN HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE AND HID THEM ALL IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE BETWEEN HIGH ROCKS
AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD FORCE OF TRUTH AND EARNESTNESS THE JURY AND THE POPULACE BECAME ONE AT LAST WHEN HE APPEALED BY NAME TO MONSIEUR LORRY AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN THEN AND THERE PRESENT WHO LIKE HIMSELF
BY THE SURRENDER OF THE CITIZEN EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY DOCTOR MANETTE WAS NEXT QUESTIONED HIS HIGH PERSONAL POPULARITY AND THE CLEARNESS OF HIS ANSWERS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION
YOU KNOW SHE MUST BE ATTACHED TO HIM I UNDERSTAND
AND TWO HAD ALREADY BEEN GUILLOTINED AND FORGOTTEN THE LIST WAS READ IN THE VAULTED CHAMBER WHERE DARNAY HAD SEEN THE ASSOCIATED PRISONERS ON THE NIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL EVERY ONE OF THOSE HAD PERISHED IN THE MASSACRE
THAT MIGHT ONLY HAVE SPREAD A NEW GRACE AND INSPIRED A WARMER INTEREST BUT WHEN CATHERINE SAW HER IN PUBLIC ADMITTING CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ATTENTIONS AS READILY AS THEY WERE OFFERED
HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE WILL SOON EXPIRE AND HE MUST RETURN TO HIS REGIMENT AND WHAT WILL THEN BE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
TO REND HIM TO PIECES AND STREW HIM OVER THE STREETS HIS REMOVAL TO MAKE WAY FOR OTHER ACCUSED PERSONS WHO WERE TO BE TRIED RESCUED HIM FROM THESE CARESSES FOR THE MOMENT
SO THAT HIS TEARS AND HER LIPS MIGHT COME TOGETHER UNSEEN A FEW OF THE PEOPLE FELL TO DANCING
THE PRESIDENT REMINDED HIM TRUE BUT NOT AN ENGLISH WOMAN A CITIZENESS OF FRANCE YES BY BIRTH HER NAME AND FAMILY
THE MESS ROOM WILL DRINK ISABELLA THORPE FOR A FORTNIGHT AND SHE WILL LAUGH WITH YOUR BROTHER OVER POOR TILNEY'S PASSION FOR A MONTH CATHERINE WOULD CONTEND NO LONGER AGAINST COMFORT
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE MONKEYS HAD NO HISTORY BOOKS OF THEIR OWN BEFORE DOCTOR DOLITTLE CAME TO WRITE THEM FOR THEM THEY REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS BY TELLING STORIES TO THEIR CHILDREN
WHOSE LIFE WAS FORFEIT TO THE REPUBLIC UNDER THE DECREE WHICH BANISHED ALL EMIGRANTS ON PAIN OF DEATH IT WAS NOTHING THAT THE DECREE BORE DATE SINCE HIS RETURN TO FRANCE THERE HE WAS AND THERE WAS THE DECREE
WAS A BRIDGE ALL READY FOR HIM MADE OF LIVING MONKEYS FOR WHILE HIS BACK WAS TURNED THE MONKEYS QUICK AS A FLASH HAD MADE THEMSELVES INTO A BRIDGE
WITH THE SECOND PREDOMINATING NO SOONER WAS THE ACQUITTAL PRONOUNCED THAN TEARS WERE SHED AS FREELY AS BLOOD AT ANOTHER TIME AND SUCH FRATERNAL EMBRACES WERE BESTOWED UPON THE PRISONER BY AS MANY OF BOTH SEXES AS COULD RUSH AT HIM
WITH HIS SHORT LEGS SOON GOT TIRED AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO CARRY HIM WHICH MADE IT PRETTY HARD WHEN THEY HAD THE TRUNK AND THE HAND BAG WITH THEM AS WELL THE KING OF THE JOLLIGINKI
MANY GREAT EXPLORERS AND GRAY BEARDED NATURALISTS HAVE LAIN LONG WEEKS HIDDEN IN THE JUNGLE WAITING TO SEE THE MONKEYS DO THAT TRICK BUT WE NEVER LET A WHITE MAN GET A GLIMPSE OF IT BEFORE YOU ARE THE FIRST TO SEE THE FAMOUS BRIDGE OF APES
BUT A WILD INFECTION OF THE WILDLY SHAKEN PUBLIC MIND IN SEASONS OF PESTILENCE SOME OF US WILL HAVE A SECRET ATTRACTION TO THE DISEASE A TERRIBLE PASSING INCLINATION TO DIE OF IT
FIVE WERE TO BE TRIED TOGETHER NEXT AS ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC FORASMUCH AS THEY HAD NOT ASSISTED IT BY WORD OR DEED SO QUICK WAS THE TRIBUNAL TO COMPENSATE ITSELF AND THE NATION FOR A CHANCE LOST
THE NIGHT IN ITS VERMIN HAUNTED CELLS WAS LONG AND COLD NEXT DAY FIFTEEN PRISONERS WERE PUT TO THE BAR BEFORE CHARLES DARNAY'S NAME WAS CALLED ALL THE FIFTEEN WERE CONDEMNED
BUT BEFORE THEY COULD GET INTO THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS THEY CAME TO A STEEP CLIFF WITH A RIVER FLOWING BELOW THIS WAS THE END OF THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI
WAS PACKED OFF TO HELP THE SOLDIERS IN THEIR SEARCH ALL THIS TIME THE DOCTOR AND HIS ANIMALS WERE RUNNING THROUGH THE FOREST TOWARDS THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO GUB GUB
BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD VERY LONG EARS THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS VERY SHORT AND AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HOLD OF THE DOCTOR ONE OF HIS EARS CAUGHT FAST IN A TREE
AT LAST WHEN DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO COME THROUGH THE THICK LEAVES OVERHEAD THEY HEARD QUEEN ERMINTRUDE SAYING IN A VERY TIRED VOICE THAT IT WAS NO USE LOOKING ANY MORE THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK AND GET SOME SLEEP
AND SHE THOUGHT WITH SINCERE COMPASSION OF HIS APPROACHING DISAPPOINTMENT FOR IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD BELIEVED HERSELF TO OVERHEAR IN THE PUMP ROOM HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS SO INCOMPATIBLE WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF ISABELLA'S ENGAGEMENT
BUT IT WAS A DEGREE OF WILFUL THOUGHTLESSNESS WHICH CATHERINE COULD NOT BUT RESENT JAMES WAS THE SUFFERER SHE SAW HIM GRAVE AND UNEASY AND HOWEVER CARELESS OF HIS PRESENT COMFORT
LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THE FIVE HAD HAD IT IS TRUE NO AUDIENCE TO LENGTHEN THEIR PROCEEDINGS FOR WHEN HE AND DOCTOR MANETTE EMERGED FROM THE GATE THERE WAS A GREAT CROWD ABOUT IT
CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE IT THEY EVEN GOT THE DOCTOR SOME TOBACCO ONE DAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED WHAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND WANTED TO SMOKE
AND SO DID ALL OF THEM JOHN DOLITTLE WAS THE LAST TO CROSS AND JUST AS HE WAS GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUSHING UP TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THEN THEY SHOOK THEIR FISTS AND YELLED WITH RAGE
THE SEVENTH CHAPTER
ISABELLA IS WRONG BUT I AM SURE SHE CANNOT MEAN TO TORMENT FOR SHE IS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER SHE HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM EVER SINCE THEY FIRST MET AND WHILE MY FATHER'S CONSENT WAS UNCERTAIN SHE FRETTED HERSELF ALMOST INTO A FEVER
THESE MONKEYS MADE A TREMENDOUS NOISE CHEERING AND WAVING LEAVES AND SWINGING OUT OF THE BRANCHES TO GREET HIM THEY WANTED TO CARRY HIS BAG AND HIS TRUNK AND EVERYTHING HE HAD AND ONE OF THE BIGGER ONES EVEN CARRIED GUB GUB
I THINK MISTER MORLAND WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE A DIFFERENCE NO MAN IS OFFENDED BY ANOTHER MAN'S ADMIRATION OF THE WOMAN HE LOVES IT IS THE WOMAN ONLY WHO CAN MAKE IT A TORMENT CATHERINE BLUSHED FOR HER FRIEND AND SAID
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR HIS ARMY TO FIND THEM BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WAS IN A STRANGE LAND AND WOULD NOT KNOW HIS WAY BUT HE WAS WRONG BECAUSE THE MONKEY CHEE CHEE KNEW ALL THE PATHS THROUGH THE JUNGLE BETTER EVEN THAN THE KING'S MEN DID
IN WINDING AND TRAMPING THROUGH THEM AS THEY HAD REDDENED THEM BELOW THE SNOW WITH A DEEPER DYE THEY CARRIED HIM THUS INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE BUILDING WHERE HE LIVED HER FATHER HAD GONE ON BEFORE TO PREPARE HER
WHO WORE THEIR USUAL CLOTHES AND HAD NOT ASSUMED THE COARSE GARB
THE BRIDGE OF APES QUEEN ERMINTRUDE HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE SEEN HER HUSBAND SO TERRIBLE AS HE GOT THAT NIGHT HE GNASHED HIS TEETH WITH RAGE
THE JURYMEN VOTED ALOUD AND INDIVIDUALLY THE POPULACE SET UP A SHOUT OF APPLAUSE ALL THE VOICES WERE IN THE PRISONER'S FAVOUR AND THE PRESIDENT DECLARED HIM FREE
IS HE SAFE ONLY IN SOLITUDE OR IS HER HEART CONSTANT TO HIM ONLY WHEN UNSOLICITED BY ANYONE ELSE HE CANNOT THINK THIS AND YOU MAY BE SURE
HENRY SMILED AND SAID I AM SURE MY BROTHER WOULD NOT WISH TO DO THAT THEN YOU WILL PERSUADE HIM TO GO AWAY PERSUASION IS NOT AT COMMAND BUT PARDON ME
THEY'VE GOT THE CAPTAIN LOOSE AND HE'S COMING ON LIKE A DEER GET LIVELY
I HAVE MYSELF TOLD HIM THAT MISS THORPE IS ENGAGED HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT AND MUST BE HIS OWN MASTER NO HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT CRIED CATHERINE HE DOES NOT KNOW THE PAIN HE IS GIVING MY BROTHER
IN WHICH THERE SEEMED TO BE EVERY FACE HE HAD SEEN IN COURT EXCEPT TWO FOR WHICH HE LOOKED IN VAIN ON HIS COMING OUT THE CONCOURSE MADE AT HIM ANEW WEEPING EMBRACING AND SHOUTING ALL BY TURNS AND ALL TOGETHER
SO FAR FROM BEING IN FAVOUR WITH THE ARISTOCRAT GOVERNMENT THERE HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TRIED FOR HIS LIFE BY IT AS THE FOE OF ENGLAND AND FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES AS HE BROUGHT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INTO VIEW WITH THE GREATEST DISCRETION
YES I THINK SO FOR YOU MUST KNOW YOUR BROTHER'S HEART MY BROTHER'S HEART AS YOU TERM IT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION I ASSURE YOU I CAN ONLY GUESS AT WELL
AND THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE ACROSS THE RIVER AND JIP THE DOG LOOKED DOWN OVER THE EDGE OF THE STEEP STEEP CLIFF AND SAID GOLLY HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET ACROSS
HE WAS PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH
WHEN CATHERINE KNEW THIS HER RESOLUTION WAS DIRECTLY MADE SHE SPOKE TO HENRY TILNEY ON THE SUBJECT REGRETTING HIS BROTHER'S EVIDENT PARTIALITY FOR MISS THORPE AND ENTREATING HIM TO MAKE KNOWN HER PRIOR ENGAGEMENT
DO YOU KNOW DUNWOODIE HAVE YOU SEEN HIM OFTEN ONCE MORE FRANCES VENTURED TO LOOK HER GUEST IN THE FACE AND AGAIN SHE MET THE PIERCING EYES BENT ON HER AS IF TO SEARCH HER INMOST HEART SPEAK MISS WHARTON IS MAJOR DUNWOODIE KNOWN TO YOU
HER LAST NIGHT'S JOURNEYING HAD ROBBED HER THE APARTMENT OF MISS SINGLETON COMMUNICATED WITH THE ROOM OCCUPIED BY THE SISTERS THROUGH A PRIVATE DOOR AS WELL AS THROUGH THE ORDINARY PASSAGE OF THE HOUSE THIS DOOR WAS PARTLY OPEN
THAT COLONEL WELLMERE WAS LEFT TO THE HOSPITALITY OF SARAH WHARTON ALL THE ORDINARY TOPICS OF CONVERSATION WERE EXHAUSTED WHEN THE COLONEL WITH A LITTLE OF THE UNEASINESS THAT IS IN SOME DEGREE INSEPARABLE FROM CONSCIOUS ERROR
BUT NOBODY HAS TO EAT IT ALL AT ONCE RETORTED UNCLE ROGER WITH ANOTHER GROAN OH SARA STANLEY IT'S A THANKFUL MAN I AM THAT YOUR AUNT OLIVIA IS TO BE HOME TO NIGHT YOU'D HAVE ME KILT ENTIRELY BY ANOTHER DAY
BEFORE IT WAS SUCCEEDED BY ANOTHER EQUALLY POWERFUL AND EQUALLY ATTRACTIVE ADMIRATION AND SORROW WERE HOWEVER THE PREPONDERATING PASSIONS THE LATTER WAS INDICATED BY LARGE DROPS THAT FELL FROM HER EYES ON THE PICTURE
TRIFLING INDEED COMPARED TO THE FORMER RETURNED THE COLONEL IN THE SAME MANNER AH MISS WHARTON IT IS IN SUCH MOMENTS THAT WE FEEL THE FULL VALUE OF FRIENDSHIP AND SYMPATHY THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER TRIED IT CANNOT EASILY IMAGINE WHAT A RAPID PROGRESS
HE TORMENTED HER FOR THE REST OF THE SUMMER NEVER A BREAKFAST DID HE SIT DOWN TO WITHOUT GRAVELY INQUIRING IF THEY WERE SURE THERE WAS NO SAWDUST IN THE PORRIDGE
AS THE STORY GIRL PROUDLY INFORMED US WHEN WE CAME TO THE DINNER TABLE ALL ON HER OWN HOOK SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF IT AND CERTAINLY AS FAR AS APPEARANCE WENT IT JUSTIFIED HER TRIUMPH THE SLICES WERE SMOOTH AND GOLDEN
FELICITY HAVING USED UP ALL THE AVAILABLE COOKING MATERIALS IN THE HOUSE HAD TO STOP PERFORCE AND SHE NOW DETERMINED TO STUFF TWO NEW PINCUSHIONS SHE HAD BEEN MAKING FOR HER ROOM
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR A HORRIBLE FEAR WHICH FLASHED INTO HER MIND THAT POSSIBLY SAWDUST PUDDINGS WERE NOT HEALTHY FOR PEOPLE TO EAT
SIXTY YEAR OLD SAWDUST CAN'T BE GOOD FOR MY TUMMY I DARESAY IT WASN'T EVEN CLEAN WELL YOU KNOW EVERY ONE HAS TO EAT A PECK OF DIRT IN HIS LIFE GIGGLED FELICITY
ISABELLA MOVED FROM THE WINDOW AS HER LAST TONES MELTED ON THE EAR OF HER ADMIRING LISTENER AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HER EYE RESTED ON THE PALLID FACE OF THE INTRUDER A GLOW OF FIRE LIGHTED THE COUNTENANCE OF BOTH AT THE SAME INSTANT
YET BLIGHTED AFFECTION REPRESSES MY SMILE ABROAD THE WILD FURY OF WINTER IS LOWERING AND LEAFLESS AND DREAR IS THE TREE BUT THE VERTICAL SUN OF THE SOUTH APPEARS POURING ITS FIERCE KILLING HEATS UPON ME
AND FRANCES MOVED TOWARDS IT WITH THE BENEVOLENT INTENTION OF ASCERTAINING THE SITUATION OF HER GUEST WHEN THE SURPRISED GIRL SAW HER WHOM SHE HAD THOUGHT TO BE SLEEPING NOT ONLY AWAKE BUT EMPLOYED IN A MANNER
FRANCES WITNESSED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE WOODEN TENEMENT OF THE DECEASED
TOMMY AND ADAM COWAN OVER AT MARKDALE ARE TWINS AND THEY'RE BOTH CROSS EYED SO I S'POSED THAT WAS WHAT BEING TWINS MEANT IT'S ALL VERY FINE FOR YOU FELLOWS TO LAUGH I NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL HALF AS MUCH AS YOU DID AND YOU WAS BROUGHT UP IN TORONTO TOO
FELICITY IF I DIE FROM THE EFFECTS OF EATING SAWDUST PUDDING FLAVOURED WITH NEEDLES YOU'LL BE SORRY YOU EVER SAID SUCH A THING TO YOUR POOR OLD UNCLE SAID UNCLE ROGER REPROACHFULLY EVEN IF THERE WERE NO NEEDLES IN IT
A SEASON WHOSE TEMPERATURE VARIES FROM THE HEATS OF SUMMER TO THE COLD OF WINTER FRANCES HAD STOOD AT THE WINDOW OF HER OWN APARTMENT WATCHING THE SLOW PROGRESS OF THE FUNERAL PROCESSION WITH A MELANCHOLY THAT WAS TOO DEEP TO BE EXCITED BY THE SPECTACLE
FELICITY WAS CUMBERED WITH MANY CARES THE NEXT MORNING FOR ONE THING THE WHOLE HOUSE MUST BE PUT IN APPLE PIE ORDER AND FOR ANOTHER AN ELABORATE SUPPER MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN OF THE TRAVELLERS THAT NIGHT FELICITY DEVOTED HER WHOLE ATTENTION TO THIS
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE SAD OFFICE THAT WAS IN UNISON WITH HER FEELINGS AS SHE GAZED AROUND SHE SAW THE TREES BENDING TO THE FORCE OF THE WIND THAT SWEPT THROUGH THE VALLEY WITH AN IMPETUOSITY THAT SHOOK EVEN THE BUILDINGS
I BELIEVE YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE TO HAVE A STORY TO TELL UNCLE ROGER HOBBLED OFF TO THE BARN STILL HOLDING ON TO HIS STOMACH DO YOU THINK HE REALLY FEELS SICK ASKED THE STORY GIRL ANXIOUSLY NO I DON'T SAID FELICITY
AND LACKED THE RICHNESS OF FLAVOUR WHICH WAS CUSTOMARY IN AUNT JANET'S CORNMEAL PUDDINGS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF SAUCE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DRY EATING INDEED EATEN IT WAS HOWEVER TO THE LAST CRUMB
AND LEFT THE SECONDARY PREPARATION OF THE REGULAR MEALS TO CECILY AND THE STORY GIRL IT WAS AGREED THAT THE LATTER WAS TO MAKE A CORNMEAL PUDDING FOR DINNER IN SPITE OF HER DISASTER WITH THE BREAD
WAS SAID BY THE GENTLEMAN HE UTTERED A THOUSAND THINGS THAT DELIGHTED HIS COMPANION
AND THE FOREST THAT HAD SO LATELY GLITTERED IN THE SUN WITH ITS VARIEGATED HUES WAS FAST LOSING ITS LOVELINESS AS THE LEAVES WERE TORN FROM THE BRANCHES AND WERE DRIVING IRREGULARLY BEFORE THE EDDIES OF THE BLAST
THE CHILLING WHITE OF HER COMPLEXION WAS STRONGLY CONTRASTED WITH EYES OF THE DEEPEST BLACK THAT WERE FIXED IN ROOTED ATTENTION ON A PICTURE SHE HELD IN HER HAND FRANCES HARDLY BREATHED AS SHE WAS ENABLED BY A MOVEMENT OF ISABELLA
LONG HAS THE STORM POURED ITS WEIGHT ON MY NATION AND LONG HAVE HER BRAVES STOOD THE SHOCK LONG HAS HER CHIEFTAIN ENNOBLED HIS STATION A BULWARK ON LIBERTY'S ROCK UNLICENSED AMBITION RELAXES ITS TOIL
THE POOR STORY GIRL WENT VERY WHITE OH UNCLE ROGER COULD IT BE POSSIBLE YOU COULDN'T HAVE SWALLOWED A NEEDLE WITHOUT KNOWING IT IT WOULD HAVE STUCK IN YOUR TONGUE OR TEETH I DIDN'T CHEW THE PUDDING GROANED UNCLE ROGER IT WAS TOO TOUGH I JUST SWALLOWED THE CHUNKS WHOLE
TOUCHED LIGHTLY ON THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE PRECEDING DAY WE LITTLE THOUGHT MISS WHARTON WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MISTER DUNWOODIE IN YOUR HOUSE IN QUEEN STREET THAT HE WAS TO BE THE RENOWNED WARRIOR HE HAS PROVED HIMSELF SAID WELLMERE ENDEAVORING TO SMILE AWAY HIS CHAGRIN
AND SHE DREW BACK TO A CHAIR WHERE SHE STILL RETAINED A VIEW OF THE STRANGER FROM WHOSE COUNTENANCE SHE FELT IT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO WITHDRAW HER EYES ISABELLA WAS TOO MUCH ENGROSSED BY HER OWN FEELINGS TO DISCOVER THE TREMBLING FIGURE OF THE WITNESS TO HER ACTIONS AND SHE PRESSED
IF IT WERE NOT JUST WHAT A CORNMEAL PUDDING MIGHT BE THE REST OF THE BILL OF FARE HAD BEEN EXTRA GOOD AND OUR APPETITES MATCHED IT I WISH I WAS TWINS SO'S I COULD EAT MORE SAID DAN WHEN HE SIMPLY HAD TO STOP
HE IS MY RELATIVE SAID FRANCES APPALLED AT THE MANNER OF THE OTHER A RELATIVE ECHOED MISS SINGLETON IN WHAT DEGREE SPEAK MISS WHARTON I CONJURE YOU TO SPEAK OUR PARENTS WERE COUSINS FAINTLY REPLIED FRANCES
TIS THOUGHT YOU HAVE LITTLE TO APPREHEND FOR YOUR BROTHER SAID FRANCES IN THE SAME EMBARRASSED MANNER HAD YOU SEEN HIM WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT IN BY MAJOR DUNWOODIE FRANCES PAUSED WITH A FEELING OF CONSCIOUS SHAME
AND WHICH FOLLOWED EACH OTHER OVER HER CHEEK AT SUCH INTERVALS AS SEEMED TO PRONOUNCE THE GRIEF TOO HEAVY TO ADMIT OF
THAT BANISHED ALL PROBABILITY OF PRESENT REPOSE THE BLACK TRESSES THAT DURING THE DINNER HAD BEEN DRAWN IN CLOSE FOLDS OVER THE CROWN OF THE HEAD WERE NOW LOOSENED AND FELL IN PROFUSION OVER HER SHOULDERS AND BOSOM IMPARTING A SLIGHT DEGREE OF WILDNESS TO HER COUNTENANCE
AND IN RAISING HER EYES SHE SAW ISABELLA STUDYING HER COUNTENANCE WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT AGAIN DROVE THE BLOOD TUMULTUOUSLY TO HER TEMPLES YOU WERE SPEAKING OF MAJOR DUNWOODIE SAID ISABELLA FAINTLY HE WAS WITH CAPTAIN SINGLETON
AND BARE IS THE OAK ON THE HILL SLOWLY THE VAPORS EXHALE FROM THE FOUNTAIN AND BRIGHT GLEAMS THE ICE BORDERED RILL ALL NATURE IS SEEKING ITS ANNUAL REST BUT THE SLUMBERS OF PEACE HAVE DESERTED MY BREAST
FRANCES FELT SHE WAS IMPROPERLY PRYING INTO THE SACRED PRIVACY OF ANOTHER BUT HER EMOTIONS WERE TOO POWERFUL TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK
WE HEARD HER RUMMAGING IN THE PANTRY AS WE SAT ON THE COOL SPRUCE SHADOWED CELLAR DOOR OUTSIDE WHERE UNCLE ROGER WAS SHOWING US HOW TO MAKE ELDERBERRY POP GUNS PRESENTLY SHE CAME OUT FROWNING CECILY
AND HE IS TO BE YOUR HUSBAND SAID THE STRANGER IMPETUOUSLY FRANCES FELT SHOCKED AND ALL HER PRIDE AWAKENED BY THIS DIRECT ATTACK UPON HER FEELINGS AND SHE RAISED HER EYES FROM THE FLOOR TO HER INTERROGATOR A LITTLE PROUDLY
THE WEATHER WHICH HAD BEEN MILD AND CLEAR SINCE THE STORM NOW CHANGED WITH THE SUDDENNESS OF THE AMERICAN CLIMATE TOWARDS EVENING THE COLD BLASTS POURED DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND FLURRIES OF SNOW PLAINLY INDICATED THAT THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER HAD ARRIVED
IF SHE WERE BEING LED TO THE STAKE AND HE RAN AND WAKENED UP A VERY TIRED DOCTOR JUST AS HE HAD GOT TO SLEEP OH DOCTOR MY SON HAS SWALLOWED A MOUSE HE CRIED WHAT SHALL I DO
THERE WAS A PLAINTIVE EARNESTNESS IN THE VOICE OF MISS SINGLETON THAT DISARMED FRANCES OF ALL RESENTMENT AND THE ONLY ANSWER SHE COULD MAKE WAS TO HIDE HER BURNING FACE BETWEEN HER HANDS AS SHE SANK BACK IN A CHAIR TO CONCEAL HER CONFUSION
WERE VERY FAIR TO VIEW NEVERTHELESS ALTHOUGH NONE OF US NOT EVEN UNCLE ROGER OR FELICITY SAID A WORD AT THE TIME FOR FEAR OF HURTING THE STORY GIRL'S FEELINGS THE PUDDING DID NOT TASTE EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD IT WAS TOUGH DECIDEDLY TOUGH
A WARM HEARTED FEMALE CAN MAKE IN LOVE IN THE SHORT SPACE OF HALF AN HOUR PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE IS A PREDISPOSITION TO THE DISTEMPER SARAH FOUND THE CONVERSATION WHEN IT BEGAN TO TOUCH ON FRIENDSHIP AND SYMPATHY TOO INTERESTING TO VENTURE HER VOICE WITH A REPLY
AND LET THOSE STUCK UP TORONTO BOYS GRIN LIKE CHESSY CATS BUT WHEN FELICITY LAUGHED AT HIM THE IRON ENTERED INTO PETER'S SOUL IF THE STORY GIRL LAUGHED AT PETER THE MILLS OF THE GODS GROUND OUT HIS REVENGE FOR HIM IN MID AFTERNOON
THIS SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE WEATHER AND PERHAPS THE SITUATION OF MY BROTHER HAVE UNITED TO MAKE ME MELANCHOLY MISS WHARTON SAID ISABELLA IN A LOW TONE AND IN A VOICE THAT TREMBLED AS SHE SPOKE
AND THE SIGHT ADDED TO THE CHILLING DREARINESS OF THE VIEW CAPTAIN SINGLETON WAS SLEEPING UNDER THE CARE OF HIS OWN MAN WHILE HIS SISTER HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO TAKE POSSESSION OF HER ROOM
WHEN THE PALE CHEEK AND QUIVERING LIP OF ISABELLA REMOVED HER RESENTMENT IN A MOMENT IT IS TRUE MY CONJECTURE IS TRUE SPEAK TO ME MISS WHARTON I CONJURE YOU IN MERCY TO MY FEELINGS TO TELL ME DO YOU LOVE DUNWOODIE
WHAT GOOD WOULD BEING TWINS DO YOU ASKED PETER PEOPLE WHO SQUINT CAN'T EAT ANY MORE THAN PEOPLE WHO DON'T SQUINT CAN THEY WE COULD NOT SEE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN PETER'S TWO QUESTIONS WHAT HAS SQUINTING GOT TO DO WITH TWINS ASKED DAN
TWAS UNFORTUNATE INDEED IN EVERY RESPECT THAT YOU MET WITH THE ACCIDENT OR DOUBTLESS THE ROYAL ARMS WOULD HAVE TRIUMPHED IN THEIR USUAL MANNER AND YET THE PLEASURE OF SUCH SOCIETY AS THIS ACCIDENT HAS INTRODUCED ME TO
WHILE THIS EXTRAORDINARY SCENE WAS ACTING IN THE ROOM OF MISS SINGLETON MATTERS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE WERE AGITATED IN THE DRAWING ROOM THE DISPOSITION OF THE FRAGMENTS OF SUCH A
HOW ON EARTH DID YOU MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE IT LOOKED JUST LIKE CORNMEAL SAID THE STORY GIRL GOING FROM WHITE TO RED IN HER SHAME WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE UP TRYING TO COOK AND STICK TO THINGS I CAN DO
IF YOU'D WORKED OUT EVER SINCE YOU WAS SEVEN AND JUST GOT TO SCHOOL IN THE WINTER THERE'D BE LOTS OF THINGS YOU WOULDN'T KNOW EITHER
YOU KNOW LOTS OF THINGS THEY DON'T BUT PETER WAS NOT TO BE CONCILIATED AND TOOK HIMSELF OFF IN HIGH DUDGEON TO BE LAUGHED AT BEFORE FELICITY TO BE LAUGHED AT BY FELICITY WAS SOMETHING HE COULD NOT ENDURE LET CECILY AND THE STORY GIRL CACKLE ALL THEY WANTED TO
EVERY MOVEMENT OF ISABELLA WAS MARKED BY AN ENTHUSIASM THAT WAS PECULIAR TO HER NATURE AND EVERY PASSION IN ITS TURN TRIUMPHED IN HER BREAST THE FURY OF THE WIND AS IT WHISTLED ROUND THE ANGLES OF THE BUILDING WAS IN CONSONANCE WITH THOSE FEELINGS
I'VE DISCOVERED A GREAT DEAL MORE MUCH MORE THAN'S KNOWN TO ANYBODY FOLLIOT THREW ONE LEG OVER THE OTHER AND BEGAN TO JOG HIS FOOT OH HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE DEAR ME AND WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW DOCTOR AUGHT YOU CAN TELL ME EH
AND BY THAT TIME THEY WILL PICK US UP HIS VOICE WAS HIGH AND HARSH IN THE ALMOST PAINFUL SILENCE WHICH FOLLOWED THE STOPPAGE OF THE ENGINES IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE BOAT HAD COME ALONGSIDE MANNED
WHICH DISTINGUISHED THE MAJORITY OF THE INHABITANTS AT DARTMOOR THEY WAITED UNTIL THEY HEARD THE WARDER'S STEP CLEAR THE PASSAGE AND UNTIL HIS IRON SHOD BOOTS WERE TRAMPING OVER THE COBBLED PATH WHICH LED FROM THE DOOR THROUGH THE TINY GARDEN TO THE ROAD
HE HEARD HIS WARDER'S VOICE BEHIND HIM RIGHT TURN FORTY THREE QUICK MARCH HE WALKED AHEAD OF THE ARMED GUARD THROUGH THE GREAT AND GLOOMY GATES OF THE PRISON TURNED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT AND WALKED UP THE VILLAGE STREET
HE TURNED AT THE SOUND OF A VOICE HE WAS STANDING ON THE SLOPE OF A SMALL TOR AT THE FOOT THERE WAS A SMOOTH STRETCH OF GREEN SWARD IT WAS ON THIS STRETCH THAT THE PEOPLE OF DARTMOOR HELD THEIR PONY RACES IN THE SUMMER MONTHS
I WAS HERE WHEN I WAS A KID CONFESSED THE PAPER HANGER I AM GOING OUT NEXT WEEK JOHN LEXMAN LOOKED AT HIM ENVIOUSLY HAD THE MAN TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD INHERITED A GREAT FORTUNE AND A GREATER TITLE
IT WAS A SQUARE BUILDING OF OLD STONE ITS WALLS UNLINED UNPLASTERED ITS FLOOR PAVED WITH MUCH WORN FLAGS OF LIMESTONE EVIDENTLY SET DOWN IN A LONG DEAD AGE
AND NOW POLISHED TO MARBLE LIKE SMOOTHNESS IN ITS MIDST SET FLUSH WITH THE FLOOR WAS WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY A TRAP DOOR FURNISHED WITH A HEAVY IRON RING TO THIS FOLLIOT POINTED
HAD THAT PUT IN HE CONTINUED AND TURNED THE TOP OF THE BUILDING INTO A LITTLE SNUGGERY COME UP HE LED THE WAY TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS IN ONE CORNER OF THE LOWER ROOM PUSHED OPEN A DOOR AT THEIR HEAD
HE'S UPSTAIRS IN THE BACK ROOM THE WARDER STEPPED OUT OF THE DOOR AND LOOKED LEFT AND RIGHT COMING UP FROM PRINCETOWN WAS A BIG GREY CAR PUT DOWN YOUR PAINT POT HE SAID HIS VOICE WAS SHAKING WITH EXCITEMENT I AM GOING UPSTAIRS
AND AS THE AEROPLANE FELL HE HAD TIME TO OBSERVE THAT A BOAT HAD BEEN PUT OFF THEN WITH A JERK THE MONOPLANE FLATTENED OUT AND CAME LIKE A SKIMMING BIRD TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER HER ENGINES STOPPED
WHICH SHOWED THAT HE KNEW HE HAD THE WHIP HAND SHALL I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT FALKINER WRAYE HE ASKED I WILL IT'S DEEPLY INTERESTING MISTER FALKINER WRAYE AFTER CHEATING AND DECEIVING BRAKE
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE OLD WELL HOUSE WHEN BRYCE CAME HURRYING UP TO HIM FOLLIOT WAS STANDING AT HIS GARDEN DOOR WITH HIS HANDS THRUST UNDER HIS COAT TAILS THE VERY PICTURE OF A BENEVOLENT LEISURED GENTLEMAN
BRYCE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION POINTED OUT BEHIND THE PERGOLA OF RAMBLER ROSES THE FIGURES OF MEN WERE COMING TOWARDS THE OLD WELL HOUSE LED BY ONE OF FOLLIOT'S GARDENERS SUDDENLY THEY EMERGED INTO FULL VIEW
BUT AS WHO HE REALLY WAS JOHN BRAKE THAT WAS AT A PLACE CALLED BRADEN MEDWORTH NEAR BARTHORPE IN LEICESTERSHIRE HE PAUSED THERE WATCHING FOLLIOT BUT FOLLIOT SHOWED NO MORE THAN CLOSE ATTENTION AND BRYCE WENT ON
WATER GAVE OUT SOME YEARS AGO SOME PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PULLED THIS OLD WELL HOUSE DOWN BUT NOT ME I DID BETTER I TURNED IT TO GOOD ACCOUNT HE RAISED A HAND AND POINTED UPWARD TO AN OBVIOUSLY MODERN CEILING OF STRONG OAK TIMBERS
TO THE DANGEROUS SEAT BEHIND HE WAS DEADLY COLD
VIEWED FROM THE HEIGHT AT WHICH THEY FLEW IT LOOKED NO MORE THAN A WHITE SPECK IN A GREAT BLUE SAUCER BUT PRESENTLY THE MACHINE BEGAN TO DIP FALLING AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED WHICH TOOK AWAY THE BREATH OF THE MAN WHO WAS HANGING ON WITH BOTH HANDS
WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ASKED FOLLIOT
IT WAS ALL SO INCREDIBLE SO IMPOSSIBLE HE EXPECTED TO WAKE UP
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO
AND ABOUT WHO KILLED HIM AND WHY THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OF DOING ALL THAT SORT OF THING YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK A LONG WAY BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNINGS I WENT BACK TO THE TIME WHEN BRADEN WAS MARRIED NOT AS BRADEN OF COURSE
NOT MUCH IN THAT FOR THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY HE CONTINUED BUT BRAKE HAD OTHER ASSOCIATIONS WITH BARTHORPE A BIT LATER HE GOT TO KNOW GOT INTO CLOSE TOUCH WITH A BARTHORPE MAN WHO ABOUT THE TIME OF BRAKE'S MARRIAGE
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SEE IT
REPLIED BRYCE PROMPTLY OF THE OTHER THE MAN OF LESSER IMPORTANCE FLOOD
WHICH MARKS THE CONVICT HIS HEAD WAS CLIPPED SHORT
IF BRYCE HAD BUT KNOWN IT WHILE HE REMAINED SILENT HE WATCHED BRYCE NARROWLY AND WHEN HE SPOKE HIS VOICE WAS CALM AS EVER
THEN HE'S SAFE CONCLUDED FOLLIOT YOU'LL GET NOTHING FROM ME ABOUT HIM AND NOBODY CAN GET AT YOU EXCEPT THROUGH HIM ASKED BRYCE THAT'S ABOUT IT ASSENTED FOLLIOT LACONICALLY BRYCE LAUGHED CYNICALLY
WHICH TOLD JOHN AS CLEARLY AS THOUGH THE MAN HAD CONFESSED AS MUCH THAT HE HAD NEVER OCCUPIED ANY SOCIAL POSITION IN LIFE THE WARDER'S STEP ON THE STONES OUTSIDE REDUCED THEM TO SILENCE SUDDENLY HIS VOICE CAME UP THE STAIRS
WITHOUT REPLYING IN WORDS TO THIS SUGGESTION FOLLIOT LED THE WAY THROUGH HIS ROSE TREES TO A FAR CORNER OF HIS GROUNDS WHERE AN OLD BUILDING OF GREY STONE COVERED WITH IVY STOOD AMONGST HIGH TREES
WITHIN A VERY BRIEF SPACE BUT HE WENT TO THE FIRE TOO OFTEN AND GOT HIS FINGERS BURNED IN THE END THE TWO MEN DID HIM ONE OF THEM IN PARTICULAR AND CLEARED OUT HE HAD TO STAND THE RACKET
AND THEN TO HIS LEFT HAND FALKINER WRAYE HE SAID HAD AN UNFORTUNATE GUN ACCIDENT IN HIS YOUTH WHICH MARKED HIM FOR LIFE HE LOST THE MIDDLE FINGER OF HIS LEFT HAND AND HE GOT A BAD SCAR ON HIS LEFT JAW THERE THEY ARE THOSE MARKS
BRAKE HAD EVIDENTLY A BELIEF IN THESE MEN AND HE TRUSTED THEM UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIMSELF HE SOMETIMES TRUSTED THE BANK'S MONEY TO THEM I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HE USED TO LET THEM HAVE MONEY FOR SHORT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TO BE REFUNDED
AS HE DID SO HE FELT THE CAR LEAP FORWARD UNDERNEATH HIM NOW IT WAS GOING FAST NOW FASTER NOW IT ROCKED AND SWAYED AS IT GATHERED SPEED HE FELT IT SWEEPING DOWN HILL AND UP HILL
I SHOULDN'T WONDER REMARKED BRYCE REFLECTIVELY AND ALMOST AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF I SHOULDN'T AT ALL WONDER IF GLASSDALE'S THE SORT OF MAN WHO CAN BE BOUGHT HE NO DOUBT HAS HIS PRICE BUT ALL THAT GLASSDALE KNOWS IS NOTHING
AND MOTIONED BRYCE TO ENTER QUIET ENOUGH IN HERE DOCTOR HE OBSERVED YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS PLACE BIT OF A FANCY OF MINE BRYCE ABSORBED AS HE WAS IN THE THOUGHTS OF THE MOMENT
YOU SAID JUST NOW THAT YOU'D NO DOUBT THAT MAN GLASSDALE COULD BE BOUGHT AND I'M INCLINING TO THINK THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE MEN THAT HAVE THEIR PRICE WHAT IS IT WE'VE NOT COME TO THAT RETORTED BRYCE YOU'RE A BIT MISTAKEN
WHOM HE WAS ABOUT TO CONDUCT TO THE SCAFFOLD LIFTED HIS GLASS AND DRANK A GOOD DEAL HE ANSWERED
WITH A CERTAIN KINDNESS AND A CERTAIN RESPECT WHICH WAS UNUSUAL FACE THE WALL GROWLED A VOICE AND MECHANICALLY HE TURNED HIS HANDS STILL BEHIND HIM AND STOOD STARING AT THE GREY WALL OF THE PRISON STOREHOUSE
HE NODDED AT A BOX OF CIGARS WHICH LAY OPEN ON A TABLE AT BRYCE'S ELBOW AS HE BEGAN TO MIX A COUPLE OF DRINKS HELP YOURSELF HE SAID GOOD STUFF THOSE NOT UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN BRYCE A DRINK
ONE NATURALLY ADOPTS THEIR POINT OF VIEW AND SEES LIFE THROUGH THEIR DISTORTED VISION I BET I'M NOT GIVEN AWAY WITH THE NEXT LOT THE PRISONER WENT ON I'VE GOT ONE OF THE BIGGEST IDEAS I'VE EVER HAD AND I'VE GOT A REAL GOOD MAN TO HELP ME
I WAS PUT AWAY BY A WOMAN AFTER THREE OF US HAD GOT CLEAR WITH TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS DAMN ROUGH LUCK WASN'T IT JOHN NODDED IT WAS CURIOUS HE THOUGHT HOW SYMPATHETIC ONE GROWS WITH THESE EXPONENTS OF CRIMES
AND EVENTUALLY HE CAME BACK AND MARRIED A RICH WIDOW AND SETTLED HIMSELF DOWN IN AN OUT OF THE WORLD ENGLISH TOWN TO GROW ROSES YOU'RE FALKINER WRAYE YOU KNOW MISTER FOLLIOT BRYCE LAUGHED AS HE MADE THIS DIRECT ACCUSATION
TO WHAT I KNOW FOLLIOT HAD ALLOWED HIS CIGAR TO GO OUT HE THREW IT AWAY TOOK A FRESH ONE FROM THE BOX AND SLOWLY STRUCK A MATCH AND LIGHTED IT WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW HE ASKED AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE
LEFT BARTHORPE END SETTLED IN LONDON BRAKE AND THIS MAN BEGAN TO HAVE SOME SECRET DEALINGS TOGETHER THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN IN WITH THEM TOO
HOW ASKED JOHN IN SURPRISE THE MAN JERKED HIS HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISON LARRY GREEN HE SAID BRIEFLY HE'S COMING OUT NEXT MONTH TOO AND WE ARE ALL FIXED UP PROPER WE ARE GOING TO GET THE PILE
LEAVING THE OTHER IN CHARGE OF BOTH MEN FOR AN HOUR THEY WORKED IN SILENCE UNDER THE EYES OF THE GUARD PRESENTLY THE WARDER WENT OUTSIDE AND JOHN LEXMAN HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING HIS FELLOW SUFFERER
MY WIFE SHE IS WAITING FOR YOU SAID THE OTHER HE TURNED HIS HEAD LISTENING
NOW HE SAW THE POINT FOR WHICH KARA WAS MAKING A WHITE STEAM YACHT LONG AND NARROW OF BEAM WAS STEAMING SLOWLY WESTWARD HE COULD SEE THE FEATHERY WAKE IN HER REAR
BRYCE IN HIS EAGERNESS AND SURPRISE GRASPED FOLLIOT'S ARM AND SHOOK IT GOOD HEAVENS MAN HE SAID THOSE TWO WARDS OF RANSFORD'S ARE BRAKE'S GIRL AND BOY DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT DIDN'T YOU NEVER ANSWERED FOLLIOT NEVER
NOW THEN WHO IS HE FOLLIOT REPLIED WITH A SHREWD GLANCE A MAN WHO BY GIVING AWAY ANOTHER MAN GAVE HIMSELF AWAY WOULD BE A DAMNED FOOL HE ANSWERED IF THERE IS ANOTHER MAN AS IF THERE MUST BE INTERRUPTED BRYCE
WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY TAKEN BY THE PRISON STAFF AND IT WAS TO THE DECORATION OF ONE OF THESE THAT A O FORTY THREE HAD BEEN SENT THE HOUSE WAS AS YET WITHOUT A TENANT A PAPER HANGER UNDER THE CHARGE OF ANOTHER WARDER
A WIDE TERM REMARKED FOLLIOT
YOU'RE NO DOUBT AS YOU SAY A GOOD HAND AT FINDING THINGS OUT AND YOU'VE DOUBTLESS DONE A GOOD BIT OF FERRETING AND DONE IT WELL ENOUGH IN YOUR OWN OPINION BUT THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN'T FIND OUT AND THE POLICE CAN'T FIND OUT EITHER
FOR THE DAY HE WAS TO PAINT SOME DOORS AND WINDOWS OF AN OUTLYING COTTAGE A COTTAGE OCCUPIED BY A WARDER WHO FOR SOME REASON ON THE DAY PREVIOUS HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
AT THE SIDE OF THE SEAT HE PASSED IT BACK JOHN LEXMAN READ IF YOU CANNOT SWIM THERE IS A LIFE BELT UNDER YOUR SEAT JOHN NODDED KARA WAS SEARCHING THE SEA FOR SOMETHING AND PRESENTLY HE FOUND IT
TO CHOOSE HIS OWN DINNER TO ANSWER NO CALL SAVE THE CALL OF HIS CONSCIENCE TO SEE HE CHECKED HIMSELF WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR HE ASKED IN SELF DEFENCE CONSPIRACY AND FRAUD SAID THE OTHER CHEERFULLY
BUT BRYCE SAW THAT HIS COOL ALMOST INDIFFERENT MANNER WAS CHANGING HE WAS BEGINNING UNDER THE SURFACE TO GET ANXIOUS WHEN I LEFT GLASSDALE AT NOON CONTINUED BRYCE I'D NO IDEA AND I DON'T THINK HE HAD
VEXED THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THAT DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN PAY TOMORROW AFTER THE DINNER I SIMPLY WANTED TO KNOW PLEASE DON'T HE BROKE OFF AND BEGAN PACING THE ROOM STILL MORE VEXED AS HE WALKED HE BEGAN TO STAMP WITH HIS HEELS
A TALL YOUNG FELLOW IN THE ARMY WITH A COLD FACE FAIRLY HONEST THOUGH HE WORSHIPPED SUCCESS OF EVERY SORT AND WAS ONLY CAPABLE OF THINKING OF PROMOTION HE WAS SOME SORT OF DISTANT RELATION OF ZVERKOV'S AND THIS
ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
OF DOMINATING THEM CARRYING THEM AWAY MAKING THEM LIKE ME IF ONLY FOR MY ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND UNMISTAKABLE WIT THEY WOULD ABANDON ZVERKOV HE WOULD SIT ON ONE SIDE SILENT AND ASHAMED WHILE I SHOULD CRUSH HIM THEN PERHAPS
I HATED THE ABRUPT SELF CONFIDENT TONE OF HIS VOICE HIS ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN WITTICISMS
I GREW USED TO EVERYTHING OR RATHER I VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED MYSELF TO ENDURING IT BUT I HAD A MEANS OF ESCAPE THAT RECONCILED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO FIND REFUGE IN THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL IN DREAMS OF COURSE
AND EVEN MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN THAT IS MY MAKING THIS REMARK NOW BUT THAT'S ENOUGH
I HAD NO MONEY ALL I HAD WAS NINE ROUBLES I HAD TO GIVE SEVEN OF THAT TO MY SERVANT APOLLON FOR HIS MONTHLY WAGES THAT WAS ALL I PAID HIM HE HAD TO KEEP HIMSELF
ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FAVOURED BY THE GIFTS OF NATURE MOREOVER IT WAS AS IT WERE AN ACCEPTED IDEA AMONG US THAT ZVERKOV WAS A SPECIALIST IN REGARD TO TACT AND THE SOCIAL GRACES THIS LAST FACT PARTICULARLY INFURIATED ME
I KNEW TOO PERFECTLY WELL EVEN THEN THAT I WAS MONSTROUSLY EXAGGERATING THE FACTS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT
WHO HAD IN NO WAY BEEN DISTINGUISHED AT SCHOOL WAS OF A QUIET AND EQUABLE DISPOSITION BUT I DISCOVERED IN HIM A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER AND EVEN HONESTY I DON'T EVEN SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY STUPID
OPENED THE MOVABLE PANE AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE TROUBLED DARKNESS OF THE THICKLY FALLING WET SNOW AT LAST MY WRETCHED LITTLE CLOCK HISSED OUT FIVE I SEIZED MY HAT AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT APOLLON
A LITTLE FELLOW WITH THE FACE OF A MONKEY A BLOCKHEAD WHO WAS ALWAYS DERIDING EVERYONE A VERY BITTER ENEMY OF MINE FROM OUR DAYS IN THE LOWER FORMS A VULGAR IMPUDENT SWAGGERING FELLOW WHO AFFECTED A MOST SENSITIVE FEELING
I STOLE THE BRUSHES TO CLEAN THEM FROM THE PASSAGE BEING CAREFUL HE SHOULD NOT DETECT IT FOR FEAR OF HIS CONTEMPT
THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SUCH POSITIVE INTOXICATION OF SUCH HAPPINESS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF IRONY WITHIN ME ON MY HONOUR I HAD FAITH HOPE LOVE I BELIEVED BLINDLY AT SUCH TIMES THAT BY SOME MIRACLE
DO YOU WANT TO JOIN TOO SIMONOV OBSERVED WITH NO APPEARANCE OF PLEASURE SEEMING TO AVOID LOOKING AT ME HE KNEW ME THROUGH AND THROUGH IT INFURIATED ME THAT HE KNEW ME SO THOROUGHLY WHY NOT
AND AS ALMOST ALL OF US WERE POOR HE TOOK UP A SWAGGERING TONE AMONG US HE WAS VULGAR IN THE EXTREME BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A GOOD NATURED FELLOW EVEN IN HIS SWAGGERING
AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHY AFTER ALL THAT I SHOULD GO TRUDGING OFF TO SIMONOV'S EARLY NEXT MORNING I ROUSED MYSELF AND JUMPED OUT OF BED WITH EXCITEMENT AS THOUGH IT WERE ALL ABOUT TO HAPPEN AT ONCE
AND WERE ONLY SUFFICIENTLY PRESENT TO SERVE AS AN APPETISING SAUCE THAT SAUCE WAS MADE UP OF CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS OF AGONISING INWARD ANALYSIS AND ALL THESE PANGS AND PIN PRICKS GAVE A CERTAIN PIQUANCY
I COULD NOT GIVE IN TO THEM WITH THE IGNOBLE READINESS WITH WHICH THEY GAVE IN TO ONE ANOTHER I HATED THEM FROM THE FIRST AND SHUT MYSELF AWAY FROM EVERYONE IN TIMID WOUNDED AND DISPROPORTIONATE PRIDE
WE WOULD BE RECONCILED AND DRINK TO OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP BUT WHAT WAS MOST BITTER AND HUMILIATING FOR ME WAS THAT I KNEW EVEN THEN KNEW FULLY AND FOR CERTAIN THAT I NEEDED NOTHING OF ALL THIS REALLY THAT I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO CRUSH
WITH DESPAIR I PICTURED TO MYSELF HOW COLDLY AND DISDAINFULLY THAT SCOUNDREL ZVERKOV WOULD MEET ME
AND YET YOU ARE RIGHT IT REALLY IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE
BUT I DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND HAD EVEN GIVEN UP NODDING TO THEM IN THE STREET I BELIEVE I HAD TRANSFERRED INTO THE DEPARTMENT I WAS IN SIMPLY TO AVOID THEIR COMPANY AND TO CUT OFF ALL CONNECTION WITH MY HATEFUL CHILDHOOD
MOREOVER THEY ALL BEGAN BY DEGREES TO GRASP THAT I HAD ALREADY READ BOOKS NONE OF THEM COULD READ AND UNDERSTOOD THINGS NOT FORMING PART OF OUR SCHOOL CURRICULUM OF WHICH THEY HAD NOT EVEN HEARD THEY TOOK A SAVAGE AND SARCASTIC VIEW OF IT
MY GOODNESS WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO I CRIED
SO THE THREE OF US WITH ZVERKOV FOR THE FOURTH
TWENTY EIGHT ROUBLES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT TO INVITE MYSELF SO SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY WOULD BE POSITIVELY GRACEFUL AND THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE CONQUERED AT ONCE
I WAS A TERRIBLE DREAMER I WOULD DREAM FOR THREE MONTHS ON END TUCKED AWAY IN MY CORNER AND YOU MAY BELIEVE ME THAT AT THOSE MOMENTS I HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE PERTURBATION OF HIS CHICKEN HEART
AND THEY ALL AGITATED AND OVERWHELMED ME I POLISHED MY BOOTS A SECOND TIME WITH MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE INDUCED APOLLON TO CLEAN THEM TWICE A DAY AS HE CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN HIS DUTIES REQUIRED OF HIM
CURSES ON THAT SCHOOL AND ALL THOSE TERRIBLE YEARS OF PENAL SERVITUDE IN SHORT I PARTED FROM MY SCHOOLFELLOWS AS SOON AS I GOT OUT INTO THE WORLD THERE WERE TWO OR THREE LEFT TO WHOM I NODDED IN THE STREET ONE OF THEM WAS SIMONOV
BUT DID NOT BANISH THE DISSIPATION BY THEIR APPEARANCE ON THE CONTRARY
MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
AM I KEEPING YOU I ASKED AFTER TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE
BUT IT'S A PRIVATE THING BETWEEN US FRIENDS FERFITCHKIN SAID CROSSLY AS HE TOO PICKED UP HIS HAT IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL GATHERING WE DO NOT WANT AT ALL PERHAPS THEY WENT AWAY FERFITCHKIN DID NOT GREET ME IN ANY WAY AS HE WENT OUT
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE APPLAUDING SUCH AN INSECT I GOT THE BETTER OF HIM ON THAT OCCASION BUT THOUGH ZVERKOV WAS STUPID HE WAS LIVELY AND IMPUDENT AND SO LAUGHED IT OFF AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT MY VICTORY WAS NOT REALLY COMPLETE
LIKE SOME INSOLENT FLUNKEY BOASTING OF HIS MASTER THE GENERAL'S DECORATIONS CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ZVERKOV WILL LET US PAY ALONE HE WILL ACCEPT FROM DELICACY
BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
JUST BECAUSE HE WAS A PRETTY AND PLAYFUL BOY HE WAS ALWAYS BAD AT HIS LESSONS AND GOT WORSE AND WORSE AS HE WENT ON HOWEVER HE LEFT WITH A GOOD CERTIFICATE AS HE HAD POWERFUL INTERESTS DURING HIS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE CAME IN FOR AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS
OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
THEY BOTH HAD SNUB NOSES AND I WAS AWFULLY SHY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE ALWAYS WHISPERING AND GIGGLING TOGETHER THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE USUALLY SAT IN HIS STUDY ON A LEATHER COUCH IN FRONT OF THE TABLE WITH SOME GREY HEADED GENTLEMAN
THE FIRST THING I DID ON LEAVING SCHOOL WAS TO GIVE UP THE SPECIAL JOB FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN DESTINED SO AS TO BREAK ALL TIES
BUT I HAD ALREADY CLUTCHED AT THE IDEA AND WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO FORM AN OPINION UPON THAT I RETORTED IN A SHAKING VOICE AS THOUGH SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT IS JUST MY REASON FOR WISHING IT NOW
THOUGH HE WAS BOLD IN HIS LANGUAGE I HATED HIS HANDSOME BUT STUPID FACE FOR WHICH I WOULD HOWEVER HAVE GLADLY EXCHANGED MY INTELLIGENT ONE AND THE FREE AND EASY MILITARY MANNERS IN FASHION IN THE FORTIES
I HAD BETTER NOT GO OF COURSE I MUST JUST SNAP MY FINGERS AT THEM
THEIR COARSENESS REVOLTED ME THEY LAUGHED CYNICALLY AT MY FACE AT MY CLUMSY FIGURE AND YET WHAT STUPID FACES THEY HAD THEMSELVES IN OUR SCHOOL THE BOYS FACES SEEMED IN A SPECIAL WAY TO DEGENERATE AND GROW STUPIDER
IN SPITE OF SUPERFICIAL FANTASTIC AND SHAM NOTIONS OF HONOUR AND DIGNITY ALL BUT VERY FEW OF US POSITIVELY GROVELLED BEFORE ZVERKOV AND THE MORE SO THE MORE HE SWAGGERED AND IT WAS NOT FROM ANY INTERESTED MOTIVE
THOUGH INDEED EVEN NOW I AM TO SOME EXTENT SATISFIED WITH THEM DREAMS WERE PARTICULARLY SWEET AND VIVID AFTER A SPELL OF DISSIPATION
INTO THE STREET NO I HAD A LOFTY WAY OF GETTING OUT OF IT ALL
EVEN A SIGNIFICANCE TO MY DISSIPATION IN FACT COMPLETELY ANSWERED THE PURPOSE OF AN APPETISING SAUCE THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEPTH OF MEANING IN IT AND I COULD HARDLY HAVE RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE SIMPLE VULGAR DIRECT DEBAUCHERY OF A CLERK
AND SHOWED ITSELF IN A CERTAIN RAKISHNESS I HATED THEM HORRIBLY THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM THEY REPAID ME IN THE SAME WAY AND DID NOT CONCEAL THEIR AVERSION FOR ME BUT BY THEN I DID NOT DESIRE THEIR AFFECTION
ALL OF THEM TOOK SCARCELY ANY NOTICE OF MY ENTRANCE WHICH WAS STRANGE FOR I HAD NOT MET THEM FOR YEARS EVIDENTLY THEY LOOKED UPON ME AS SOMETHING ON THE LEVEL OF A COMMON FLY I HAD NOT BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT EVEN AT SCHOOL THOUGH THEY ALL HATED ME
AND WORST OF ALL HOW PALTRY UNLITERARY COMMONPLACE IT WOULD ALL BE
I WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL BY DISTANT RELATIONS UPON WHOM I WAS DEPENDENT AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE THEY SENT ME THERE A FORLORN SILENT BOY ALREADY CRUSHED BY THEIR REPROACHES ALREADY TROUBLED BY DOUBT
BY THEN HE HAD TAKEN TO CUTTING ME IN THE STREET AND I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF COMPROMISING HIMSELF BY GREETING A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS ME I SAW HIM ONCE IN THE THEATRE IN THE THIRD TIER OF BOXES
HE WAS VERY GLAD TO GET RID OF ME I WAS IN A FURY WHAT POSSESSED ME WHAT POSSESSED ME TO FORCE MYSELF UPON THEM I WONDERED GRINDING MY TEETH AS I STRODE ALONG THE STREET FOR A SCOUNDREL A PIG LIKE THAT ZVERKOV OF COURSE
IT WAS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THAT DROVE ME TO IT AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT THRUST UPON ME YOUR HACKNEYED REMARKS REPEATED TO NAUSEA THAT I WAS ONLY A DREAMER WHILE THEY EVEN THEN HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE
BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
HOW MANY FINE LOOKING BOYS CAME TO US IN A FEW YEARS THEY BECAME REPULSIVE EVEN AT SIXTEEN I WONDERED AT THEM MOROSELY EVEN THEN I WAS STRUCK BY THE PETTINESS OF THEIR THOUGHTS THE STUPIDITY OF THEIR PURSUITS
IT'S CLOSE BY NOT TWO PACES AWAY SIMONOV REPEATED ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE FRONT DOOR WITH A FUSSY AIR WHICH DID NOT SUIT HIM AT ALL
AND LOOKING WITH SAVAGE DISTRUST AT EVERYONE MY SCHOOLFELLOWS MET ME WITH SPITEFUL AND MERCILESS JIBES BECAUSE I WAS NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR TAUNTS
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE ATTACKS OF THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL VISITED ME EVEN DURING THE PERIOD OF DISSIPATION AND JUST AT THE TIMES WHEN I WAS TOUCHING THE BOTTOM THEY CAME IN SEPARATE SPURTS AS THOUGH REMINDING ME OF THEMSELVES
AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE FILTHINESS OF IT
BUT WHAT MADE ME FURIOUS WAS THAT I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD GO THAT I SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF GOING AND THE MORE TACTLESS THE MORE UNSEEMLY MY GOING WOULD BE THE MORE CERTAINLY I WOULD GO AND THERE WAS A POSITIVE OBSTACLE TO MY GOING
WHICH I HAD INDEED NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH I HAD NOT PAID IT
I HAVE HAD NO SCRAP OF BUSINESS BUT THIS ROMANTIC BUSINESS AND I SAID EUGENE
BOB GLIDDERY RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS FROM MISTER INSPECTOR AND DEPARTED IN A BECOMING STATE OF ALACRITY ENGENDERED BY REVERENCE FOR THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW IT'S A CERTAIN FACT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR THAT THIS MAN WE HAVE RECEIVED OUR INFORMATION FROM
SHE STARTED UP HE HAD BEEN SO VERY STILL THAT HE FELT SURE IT WAS NOT HE WHO HAD DISTURBED HER SO MERELY WITHDREW FROM THE WINDOW AND STOOD NEAR IT IN THE SHADOW OF THE WALL SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SAID IN AN ALARMED TONE FATHER WAS THAT YOU CALLING ME

NO TIME AIN'T BEEN LOST ON ANY HAND THE POLICE HAVE PUT INTO PRINT ALREADY AND HERE'S WHAT THE PRINT SAYS OF IT TAKING UP THE BOTTLE WITH THE LAMP IN IT HE HELD IT NEAR A PAPER ON THE WALL WITH THE POLICE HEADING BODY FOUND
YOU MIGHTN'T BE MUCH GIVEN TO SUPPOSING AM I TO SHOW THE WAY AS HE OPENED THE DOOR IN PURSUANCE OF A NOD FROM LIGHTWOOD AN EXTREMELY PALE AND DISTURBED FACE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THE FACE OF A MAN MUCH AGITATED A BODY MISSING

FOR THE JOLLY FELLOWSHIP PORTERS ARE NOT THE JOLLIEST DOGS I HAVE KNOWN BUT I SUPPOSE WE ARE BEST HERE UNTIL THEY TURN US OUT WITH THE OTHER SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS AT MIDNIGHT
THERE WAS A CURIOUS MIXTURE IN THE BOY OF UNCOMPLETED SAVAGERY AND UNCOMPLETED CIVILIZATION HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE AND COARSE AND HIS FACE WAS COARSE AND HIS STUNTED FIGURE WAS COARSE BUT HE WAS CLEANER THAN OTHER BOYS OF HIS TYPE AND HIS WRITING THOUGH LARGE AND ROUND WAS GOOD
I DON'T LIKE THIS NOR I SAID LIGHTWOOD SHALL WE GO BEING HERE LET US STAY YOU OUGHT TO SEE IT OUT AND I WON'T LEAVE YOU BESIDES THAT LONELY GIRL WITH THE DARK HAIR RUNS IN MY HEAD

I HAD IT FIRST FROM ONE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX OF MY ACQUAINTANCE VAGUELY INDICATING MISS ABBEY WITH HIS THUMB OVER HIS SHOULDER DOWN AWAY AT A DISTANCE OVER YONDER THEN PROBABLY MISTER INSPECTOR WAS NOT QUITE UNPREPARED FOR THEIR VISIT THAT EVENING
THE FIRE WAS IN A RUSTY BRAZIER NOT FITTED TO THE HEARTH AND A COMMON LAMP SHAPED LIKE A HYACINTH ROOT SMOKED AND FLARED IN THE NECK OF A STONE BOTTLE ON THE TABLE THERE WAS A WOODEN BUNK OR BERTH IN A CORNER
I CAN HAVE NO HESITATION IN REPLYING IT NOT BEING INCONSISTENT WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICE THAT THOSE ACCENTS WERE THE ACCENTS OF THE T'OTHER GOVERNOR YOU'VE TOLERABLE GOOD EYES AIN'T YOU GOVERNOR YOU'VE ALL TOLERABLE GOOD EYES AIN'T YOU

TWO OR THREE OLD SCULLS AND OARS STOOD AGAINST THE WALL AND AGAINST ANOTHER PART OF THE WALL WAS A SMALL DRESSER MAKING A SPARE SHOW OF THE COMMONEST ARTICLES OF CROCKERY AND COOKING VESSELS THE ROOF OF THE ROOM WAS NOT PLASTERED BUT WAS FORMED OF THE FLOORING OF THE ROOM ABOVE
THE GENTLEMAN FATHER THE FIGURE AT THE RED FIRE TURNED RAISED ITS RUFFLED HEAD AND LOOKED LIKE A BIRD OF PREY YOU'RE MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD ESQUIRE ARE YOU SIR MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD IS MY NAME WHAT YOU FOUND

THAT PART OF THE BANK HAVING RANK GRASS GROWING ON IT THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING CLOSE WITHOUT ANY NOISE OF FOOTSTEPS IT WAS BUT TO SCRAMBLE UP A RAGGED FACE OF PRETTY HARD MUD SOME THREE OR FOUR FEET HIGH AND COME UPON THE GRASS AND TO THE WINDOW HE CAME TO THE WINDOW BY THAT MEANS
THEY BURN SHERRY VERY WELL HERE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AS A PIECE OF LOCAL INTELLIGENCE PERHAPS YOU GENTLEMEN MIGHT LIKE A BOTTLE THE ANSWER BEING BY ALL MEANS
BUT HE GLANCED SLIGHTLY AT THEM THOUGH HE LOOKED LONG AND STEADILY AT HER

THIS ONE WAS A SAILOR WITH TWO ANCHORS AND A FLAG AND G F T ON HIS ARM LOOK AND SEE IF HE WARN'T QUITE RIGHT THIS ONE WAS THE YOUNG WOMAN IN GREY BOOTS AND HER LINEN MARKED WITH A CROSS LOOK AND SEE IF SHE WARN'T QUITE RIGHT
IF I MIGHT SO FAR PRESUME AS TO OFFER A SUGGESTION TO MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND WHOSE KNOWLEDGE OF NAVAL MATTERS FAR BE IT FROM ME TO IMPEACH EUGENE STRUCK IN WITH GREAT DELIBERATION
HERE I AM SIR AND OUR FRIEND OF THE PERSPIRING BROW IS AT THE FAR CORNER THERE GOOD ANYTHING HAPPENED HIS DAUGHTER HAS BEEN OUT THINKING SHE HEARD HIM CALLING UNLESS IT WAS A SIGN TO HIM TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
IT WAS A LITTLE WINDOW OF BUT FOUR PIECES OF GLASS AND WAS NOT CURTAINED HE CHOSE IT BECAUSE THE LARGER WINDOW NEAR IT WAS IT SHOWED HIM THE ROOM AND THE BILLS UPON THE WALL RESPECTING THE DROWNED PEOPLE STARTING OUT AND RECEDING BY TURNS
IT IS SUCH A CONVENTIONAL SUPERSTITION SUCH PARROT GABBLE WHAT THE DEUCE AM I TO RUSH OUT INTO THE STREET COLLAR THE FIRST MAN OF A WEALTHY APPEARANCE THAT I MEET SHAKE HIM AND SAY GO TO LAW UPON THE SPOT YOU DOG AND RETAIN ME OR I'LL BE THE DEATH OF YOU YET THAT WOULD BE ENERGY
LIGHTWOOD HINTED WELL YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR IT WAS A QUESTION OF MAKING A MOVE IT'S OF NO USE MOVING IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR MOVE IS YOU HAD BETTER BY FAR KEEP STILL

BUT THERE WERE BELLS TO WINDWARD THAT TOLD THEM OF ITS BEING ONE TWO THREE WITHOUT THAT AID THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN HOW THE NIGHT WORE BY THE FALLING OF THE TIDE RECORDED IN THE APPEARANCE OF AN EVER WIDENING BLACK WET STRIP OF SHORE
THE WHEELS ROLLED ON AND ROLLED DOWN BY THE MONUMENT AND BY THE TOWER AND BY THE DOCKS DOWN BY RATCLIFFE AND BY ROTHERHITHE
ALWAYS WELL DISPOSED TO ASSIST THE CONSTITUTED AUTHORITIES MISS ABBEY BADE BOB GLIDDERY ATTEND THE GENTLEMEN TO THAT RETREAT AND PROMPTLY ENLIVEN IT WITH FIRE AND GASLIGHT
OF THIS COMMISSION THE BARE ARMED BOB LEADING THE WAY WITH A FLAMING WISP OF PAPER SO SPEEDILY ACQUITTED HIMSELF THAT COSY SEEMED TO LEAP OUT OF A DARK SLEEP AND EMBRACE THEM WARMLY THE MOMENT THEY PASSED THE LINTELS OF ITS HOSPITABLE DOOR
AT THIS TIME OF THEIR WATCH THE WATER CLOSE TO THEM WOULD BE OFTEN AGITATED BY SOME IMPULSION GIVEN IT FROM A DISTANCE
THOROUGHLY USED TO HIM AS HE WAS HE FOUND SOMETHING NEW AND STRAINED IN HIM THAT WAS FOR THE MOMENT PERPLEXING THIS PASSED INTO HIS MIND AND PASSED OUT AGAIN BUT HE REMEMBERED IT AFTERWARDS
IT PASSED INTO MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD'S MIND THAT A CHANGE OF SOME SORT BEST EXPRESSED PERHAPS AS AN INTENSIFICATION OF ALL THAT WAS WILDEST AND MOST NEGLIGENT AND RECKLESS IN HIS FRIEND HAD COME UPON HIM IN THE LAST HALF HOUR OR SO
MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND WILL I TRUST EXCUSE ME AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER FOR THROWING OUT A REMARK WHICH I FEEL TO BE DUE TO THIS HOUSE AND THE COUNTRY WAS THAT THE T'OTHER GOVERNOR OR LAWYER LIGHTWOOD ASKED RIDERHOOD
NEXT TIME WITH A VIEW TO OUR PEACE OF MIND WE'LL COMMIT THE CRIME INSTEAD OF TAKING THE CRIMINAL YOU SWEAR IT CERTAINLY SWORN LET TIPPINS LOOK TO IT HER LIFE'S IN DANGER
THE NIGHT WAS NOT SO DARK BUT THAT BESIDES THE LIGHTS AT BOWS AND MASTHEADS GLIDING TO AND FRO THEY COULD DISCERN SOME SHADOWY BULK ATTACHED AND NOW AND THEN A GHOSTLY LIGHTER WITH A LARGE DARK SAIL LIKE A WARNING ARM WOULD START UP VERY NEAR THEM PASS ON AND VANISH

WHEN THE BOY SPOKE THESE WORDS SLIGHTINGLY OF HIS SISTER HE TOOK HIM ROUGHLY ENOUGH BY THE CHIN AND TURNED UP HIS FACE TO LOOK AT IT WELL I'M SURE SIR SAID THE BOY RESISTING I HOPE YOU'LL KNOW ME AGAIN
HE COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE SHINING THROUGH THE WINDOW PERHAPS IT DREW HIM ON TO LOOK IN PERHAPS HE HAD COME OUT WITH THE EXPRESS INTENTION
IF THE REAL MAN FEELS AS GUILTY AS I DO SAID EUGENE HE IS REMARKABLY UNCOMFORTABLE INFLUENCE OF SECRECY SUGGESTED LIGHTWOOD
THE LOW BUILDING HAD THE LOOK OF HAVING ONCE BEEN A MILL
HE SPOKE IN THE SINGULAR NUMBER TO THE EXPRESS EXCLUSION OF EUGENE THIS IS A CONFOUNDEDLY OUT OF THE WAY PLACE SAID MORTIMER SLIPPING OVER THE STONES AND REFUSE ON THE SHORE AS THE BOY TURNED THE CORNER SHARP HERE'S MY FATHER'S SIR WHERE THE LIGHT IS
SHE HAD NO OTHER LIGHT THAN THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE THE UNKINDLED LAMP STOOD ON THE TABLE SHE SAT ON THE GROUND LOOKING AT THE BRAZIER WITH HER FACE LEANING ON HER HAND
BEGAN EUGENE WHICH NO MAN HAS A BETTER RIGHT TO DO THAN YOURSELF YOU KNOW SAID MISTER INSPECTOR I HOPE NOT SAID EUGENE MY FATHER HAVING BEEN A SHIPPER OF LIME BEFORE ME AND MY GRANDFATHER BEFORE HIM

AND AS THE AFTERNOON SHADOWS DEEPENED THE OWNER OF THAT NAME HIMSELF APPEARED FROM OVERLOOKING A PAINTER WHOM DOCTOR MANETTE HAD EMPLOYED TO ADD TO THE LIST THE NAME OF CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY IN THE UNIVERSAL FEAR AND DISTRUST THAT DARKENED THE TIME

LEANT FROM TIME TO TIME VERY LOVINGLY TOWARDS HIS INTERLOCUTRIX WHO WE MUST SAY DID NOT ALWAYS DRAW BACK SO RAPIDLY AS STRICT PROPRIETY HAD A RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE YOUNG GIRL
AND WHAT DO YOU DESIRE MONSIEUR DEMON THAT I SHOULD LOSE MY SOUL FROM ANGER MALICORNE WAS ROLLING HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY BETWEEN HIS FINGERS BUT ALL AT ONCE HE LET FALL HIS HAT SEIZED THE YOUNG GIRL BY THE SHOULDERS PULLED HER TOWARDS HIM AND SEALED HER MOUTH WITH TWO LIPS THAT WERE VERY WARM

A RUDE CLATTERING OF FEET OVER THE FLOOR AND FOUR ROUGH MEN IN RED CAPS ARMED WITH SABRES AND PISTOLS ENTERED THE ROOM THE CITIZEN EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY SAID THE FIRST WHO SEEKS HIM

HUMPH YOU ARE VERY POLITE SAID MALICORNE AY BUT LOOK YOU I WAS EXPECTING MONEY AND INSTEAD OF MONEY I SEE YOU
I DOUBT IT AND I SWEAR IT COXCOMB AND THEN THAT IS NOT THE TRUE REASON
WHO HAD OPENED A PRISON WALL AND LET OUT A CAPTIVE WHO HAD ONCE DONE THE FAIRY A SERVICE ALL WAS SUBDUED AND QUIET AND LUCIE WAS MORE AT EASE THAN SHE HAD BEEN WHAT IS THAT SHE CRIED ALL AT ONCE MY DEAR
HER MIND PURSUED THEM LOOKING FOR HIM AMONG THE CONDEMNED AND THEN SHE CLUNG CLOSER TO HIS REAL PRESENCE AND TREMBLED MORE HER FATHER CHEERING HER SHOWED A COMPASSIONATE SUPERIORITY TO THIS WOMAN'S WEAKNESS WHICH WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE
AND WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH TWENTY PISTOLES MON DIEU WELL SAID MALICORNE A LITTLE ANGRY SUPPOSE I WERE TO ADD THEM TO THE FIVE HUNDRED YOU ALREADY OWE ME YOU ARE RIGHT REPLIED MANICAMP STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND AGAIN AND FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW I CAN ACCEPT THEM GIVE THEM TO ME
YOU MISTOOK ME MY FRIEND YOU DID NOT HEAR PLAINLY WHAT DID YOU SAY THEN I SAID FIVE HUNDRED AND THE FIVE HUNDRED HERE THEY ARE MANICAMP DEVOURED THE ROULEAU WITH HIS EYES
THE SOCIALIST PARTY UNDER THE ABLE LEADERSHIP OF TROELSTRA HAD WON SEVERAL SEATS AT THE ELECTION AND IN NINETEEN O THREE A GENERAL STRIKE WAS THREATENED UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT CONCEDED THE DEMANDS OF THE SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY
CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE THE REIGN OF QUEEN WILHELMINA
HE TOOK MY LETTER FROM HIS DESK AND LAID IT OUT BEFORE HIM OH YOU ARE THE YOUNG PERSON WHO CANNOT UNDERSTAND PLAIN ENGLISH ARE YOU MY GENERAL CONCLUSIONS YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO APPROVE AS I UNDERSTAND ENTIRELY SIR ENTIRELY
WITH THE SETTLED DETERMINATION THAT VERY NIGHT IF POSSIBLE TO FIND THE QUEST WHICH SHOULD BE WORTHY OF MY GLADYS
IN A CONFLICT WHICH PLACED THEM IN A MOST DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS POSITION ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS ON WHICH THEY HAD TO TAKE A CRITICAL DECISION WAS THE CLOSING OF THE SCHELDT AS SOON AS GREAT BRITAIN DECLARED WAR ON GERMANY AUGUST FOURTH
WHAT IS IT THAT HE DOES THAT I DON'T DO JUST SAY THE WORD TEETOTAL VEGETARIAN AERONAUT THEOSOPHIST SUPERMAN I'LL HAVE A TRY AT IT GLADYS IF YOU WILL ONLY GIVE ME AN IDEA WHAT WOULD PLEASE YOU
BUT FORTUNATELY I WAS RESCUED FROM AN ODIOUS SITUATION A POLICEMAN WAS BESIDE US HIS NOTEBOOK IN HIS HAND WHAT'S ALL THIS YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED SAID THE POLICEMAN IT WAS THE MOST RATIONAL REMARK WHICH I HAD HEARD IN ENMORE PARK
IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS TEACHING IN THE SCHOOLS THE VICTORY LAY WITH THE COALITION
I COULD HAVE BOLTED FOR THE HALL DOOR BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO IGNOMINIOUS BESIDES A LITTLE GLOW OF RIGHTEOUS ANGER WAS SPRINGING UP WITHIN ME I HAD BEEN HOPELESSLY IN THE WRONG BEFORE BUT THIS MAN'S MENACES WERE PUTTING ME IN THE RIGHT
WHAT A PITY TO SPOIL IT DON'T YOU FEEL HOW SPLENDID IT IS THAT A YOUNG MAN AND A YOUNG WOMAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALK FACE TO FACE AS WE HAVE TALKED I DON'T KNOW GLADYS YOU SEE I CAN TALK FACE TO FACE WITH WITH THE STATION MASTER
WHICH WAS REJECTED BY THE FIRST CHAMBER A DISSOLUTION OF THIS CHAMBER LED TO THE MAJORITY BEING REVERSED AND THE MEASURE WAS PASSED ANOTHER MEASURE REVISED THE MACKAY LAW AND CONFERRED A LARGER SUBSIDY ON PRIVATE SCHOOLS
I RELENTED NO SAID I I DO NOT WHAT'S THAT SAID THE POLICEMAN I WAS TO BLAME MYSELF I INTRUDED UPON HIM HE GAVE ME FAIR WARNING THE POLICEMAN SNAPPED UP HIS NOTEBOOK
TO INCREASE CONSIDERABLY THE EXISTING DUTIES AND TO EXTEND LARGELY THE LIST OF DUTIABLE IMPORTS THIS BILL LED TO A WIDESPREAD AGITATION IN THE COUNTRY AND MANY PETITIONS WERE PRESENTED AGAINST IT
BETWEEN THE TWO BOER REPUBLICS OF SOUTH AFRICA AND GREAT BRITAIN BITTER FEELINGS WERE AROUSED AND THE QUEEN DID BUT REFLECT THE NATIONAL SENTIMENT WHEN SHE PERSONALLY RECEIVED IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER PRESIDENT KRUEGER
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW THAT OFFICIAL CAME INTO THE MATTER BUT IN HE TROTTED AND SET US BOTH LAUGHING THAT DOES NOT SATISFY ME IN THE LEAST I WANT MY ARMS ROUND YOU AND YOUR HEAD ON MY BREAST AND OH GLADYS I WANT
WHATEVER YOUR MOTIVE I AM GLAD THAT YOU WENT DOWN THAT MINE SHE GAVE ME HER HAND BUT WITH SUCH SWEETNESS AND DIGNITY THAT I COULD ONLY STOOP AND KISS IT I DARE SAY
WHY SHOULD YOU NOT I CRIED IT IS WOMEN LIKE YOU WHO BRACE MEN UP GIVE ME A CHANCE AND SEE IF I WILL TAKE IT BESIDES AS YOU SAY MEN OUGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHANCES AND NOT WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE GIVEN LOOK AT CLIVE
HE HAD THE FACE AND BEARD WHICH I ASSOCIATE WITH AN ASSYRIAN BULL THE FORMER FLORID
THE THREAT WAS MET WITH FIRMNESS AN ANTI STRIKE LAW WAS QUICKLY PASSED THE MILITARY WAS CALLED OUT AND THE STRIKE COLLAPSED
I AM SURE THAT HIS TOP HAT
ALMOST ORIENTAL IN ITS COLORING THAT RAVEN HAIR THE LARGE LIQUID EYES THE FULL BUT EXQUISITE LIPS ALL THE STIGMATA OF PASSION WERE THERE
IT HAD SEEMED SIMPLE ENOUGH AT A DISTANCE OH MY IRISH WITS COULD THEY NOT HELP ME NOW WHEN I NEEDED HELP SO SORELY HE TRANSFIXED ME WITH TWO SHARP STEELY EYES COME COME HE RUMBLED
SPADE SHAPED AND RIPPLING DOWN OVER HIS CHEST THE HAIR WAS PECULIAR PLASTERED DOWN IN FRONT IN A LONG CURVING WISP OVER HIS MASSIVE FOREHEAD THE EYES WERE BLUE GRAY UNDER GREAT BLACK TUFTS VERY CLEAR
HAD SUCCEEDED IN UNITING THE THREE CHURCH GROUPS THE DEMOCRATIC ANTI REVOLUTIONARIES THE ARISTOCRATIC HISTORICAL CHRISTIANS BOTH ORTHODOX CALVINISTS AND THE CATHOLICS OF ALL SECTIONS INTO A CHRISTIAN COALITION
BUT I WAS SADLY CONSCIOUS THAT UP TO NOW I HAD NEVER FOUND THE SECRET OF DRAWING IT FORTH HOWEVER COME WHAT MIGHT I SHOULD HAVE DONE WITH SUSPENSE AND BRING MATTERS TO A HEAD TO NIGHT SHE COULD BUT REFUSE ME
UPON WHICH HE JUMPED FROM HIS CHAIR REPROVED ME FOR MY HABITUAL LEVITY WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DISCUSS ANY REASONABLE SUBJECT IN MY PRESENCE AND BOUNCED OFF OUT OF THE ROOM TO DRESS FOR A MASONIC MEETING
ONE MUST WAIT TILL IT COMES BUT WHY CAN'T YOU LOVE ME GLADYS IS IT MY APPEARANCE OR WHAT SHE DID UNBEND A LITTLE SHE PUT FORWARD A HAND SUCH A GRACIOUS STOOPING ATTITUDE IT WAS
WHY SURELY I CRIED AND GLORIED IN MY OWN AUDACITY BUT WHAT DOES THAT PROVE
I AM OF COURSE A MERE STUDENT SAID I WITH A FATUOUS SMILE HARDLY MORE I MIGHT SAY THAN AN EARNEST INQUIRER AT THE SAME TIME IT SEEMED TO ME THAT YOU WERE A LITTLE SEVERE UPON WEISSMANN IN THIS MATTER
BEFORE I SHOULD FIND SOME DEED WHICH WAS WORTHY OF MY LADY BUT WHO WHO IN ALL THIS WIDE WORLD COULD EVER HAVE IMAGINED THE INCREDIBLE SHAPE WHICH THAT DEED WAS TO TAKE OR THE STRANGE STEPS BY WHICH I WAS LED TO THE DOING OF IT
AT LAST I WAS ALONE WITH GLADYS AND THE MOMENT OF FATE HAD COME ALL THAT EVENING I HAD FELT LIKE THE SOLDIER WHO AWAITS THE SIGNAL WHICH WILL SEND HIM ON A FORLORN HOPE HOPE OF VICTORY
THE DEPRECIATION OF THE RUPEE AND THE TRUE STANDARDS OF EXCHANGE SUPPOSE HE CRIED WITH FEEBLE VIOLENCE THAT ALL THE DEBTS IN THE WORLD WERE CALLED UP SIMULTANEOUSLY
A SUBJECT UPON WHICH HE WAS BY WAY OF BEING AN AUTHORITY FOR AN HOUR OR MORE THAT EVENING I LISTENED TO HIS MONOTONOUS CHIRRUP ABOUT BAD MONEY DRIVING OUT GOOD THE TOKEN VALUE OF SILVER
WE DID A CATHARINE WHEEL TOGETHER DOWN THE PASSAGE SOMEHOW WE GATHERED UP A CHAIR UPON OUR WAY AND BOUNDED ON WITH IT TOWARDS THE STREET
I AM MERELY A FOOLISH WOMAN WITH A YOUNG GIRL'S FANCIES AND YET IT IS SO REAL WITH ME SO ENTIRELY PART OF MY VERY SELF THAT I CANNOT HELP ACTING UPON IT IF I MARRY I DO WANT TO MARRY A FAMOUS MAN
HE GLARED AT ME AS THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BEAST THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEHAVED ABOMINABLY SAID I I ASSURE YOU THAT I CAN FIGHT MY OWN BATTLES AND THAT I HAVE NO POSSIBLE NEED OF YOUR SYMPATHY
SHE HAD SPRUNG FROM HER CHAIR AS SHE SAW SIGNS THAT I PROPOSED TO DEMONSTRATE SOME OF MY WANTS YOU'VE SPOILED EVERYTHING NED SHE SAID IT'S ALL SO BEAUTIFUL AND NATURAL UNTIL THIS KIND OF THING COMES IN
AND AFTER ALL THIS OPENING CHAPTER WILL SEEM TO THE READER TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MY NARRATIVE AND YET THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO NARRATIVE WITHOUT IT
WHO HAD WAITED LIKE A BRONZE STATUE OF DISCRETION DURING OUR SHORT INTERVIEW AND I WAS CONDUCTED TO THE END OF THE PASSAGE THERE WAS A TAP AT A DOOR A BULL'S BELLOW FROM WITHIN AND I WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE PROFESSOR
HE SAT IN A ROTATING CHAIR BEHIND A BROAD TABLE WHICH WAS COVERED WITH BOOKS MAPS AND DIAGRAMS AS I ENTERED HIS SEAT SPUN ROUND TO FACE ME HIS APPEARANCE MADE ME GASP
BUT HE STOPPED NOW AND PUT HIS BIG HANDS INTO THE SIDE POCKETS OF A RATHER BOYISH SHORT JACKET WHICH HE WORE I HAVE THROWN SEVERAL OF YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE YOU WILL BE THE FOURTH OR FIFTH
THERE ARE HEROISMS ALL ROUND US MISTER HUNGERTON HER FATHER REALLY WAS THE MOST TACTLESS PERSON UPON EARTH A FLUFFY
WHO ARRIVED IN HOLLAND AS A FUGITIVE
JUST A CLERK AND HE CONQUERED INDIA BY GEORGE I'LL DO SOMETHING IN THE WORLD YET SHE LAUGHED AT MY SUDDEN IRISH EFFERVESCENCE WHY NOT SHE SAID YOU HAVE EVERYTHING A MAN COULD HAVE
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT MERELY TO PLEASE ME YOU SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF BECAUSE IT'S NATURAL TO YOU BECAUSE THE MAN IN YOU IS CRYING OUT FOR HEROIC EXPRESSION NOW WHEN YOU DESCRIBED THE WIGAN COAL EXPLOSION LAST MONTH
BUT DON'T TELL HIM SO FOR IT MAKES HIM VERY VIOLENT PRETEND TO BELIEVE HIM AND YOU MAY GET THROUGH ALL RIGHT REMEMBER HE BELIEVES IT HIMSELF OF THAT YOU MAY BE ASSURED A MORE HONEST MAN NEVER LIVED
WHO STEPPED OUT FROM WHAT PROVED TO BE THE DINING ROOM DOOR SHE WAS A BRIGHT VIVACIOUS DARK EYED LADY MORE FRENCH THAN ENGLISH IN HER TYPE ONE MOMENT SHE SAID YOU CAN WAIT AUSTIN STEP IN HERE SIR MAY I ASK IF YOU HAVE MET MY HUSBAND BEFORE
HIS HEAD NOT HIGHER THAN MY SHOULDER A STUNTED HERCULES WHOSE TREMENDOUS VITALITY HAD ALL RUN TO DEPTH BREADTH AND BRAIN GIBBERISH HE CRIED LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS FINGERS ON THE TABLE AND HIS FACE PROJECTING
I HAVE SEEN THE TWO MACS ATTEMPT SOMETHING OF THE KIND AT THE HALLS BUT IT APPEARS TO TAKE SOME PRACTISE TO DO IT WITHOUT HURTING ONESELF THE CHAIR WENT TO MATCHWOOD AT THE BOTTOM AND WE ROLLED APART INTO THE GUTTER
FOR THINGS ARE SO MUCH NICER AS THEY ARE I DREW MY CHAIR A LITTLE NEARER NOW
THE OBJECT BEING TO PREVENT THE BRITISH FLEET FROM SEIZING FLUSHING IN THE EVENT OF THE OUTBREAK OF AN ANGLO GERMAN WAR THE PRESS AGITATION MET HOWEVER WITH NO COUNTENANCE ON THE PART OF RESPONSIBLE STATESMEN IN ANY OF THE COUNTRIES NAMED
WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE I DON'T THINK MY IDEAL WOULD SPEAK LIKE THAT SAID SHE HE WOULD BE A HARDER STERNER MAN NOT SO READY TO ADAPT HIMSELF TO A SILLY GIRL'S WHIM BUT ABOVE ALL
LOOK AT THAT YOUNG FRENCHMAN WHO WENT UP LAST WEEK IN A BALLOON IT WAS BLOWING A GALE OF WIND BUT BECAUSE HE WAS ANNOUNCED TO GO HE INSISTED ON STARTING

NO MADAM I HAVE NOT HAD THE HONOR THEN I APOLOGIZE TO YOU IN ADVANCE I MUST TELL YOU THAT HE IS A PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE PERSON ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU ARE FOREWARNED YOU WILL BE THE MORE READY TO MAKE ALLOWANCES
NEITHER I NOR ANY MAN IN ITALY COULD TAKE PLEASURE IN THOSE MELANCHOLY EXTRAVAGANCES AND THE MARRIAGE OF SIN AND DEATH AND THE SNAKES BROUGHT FORTH BY SIN
I SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH THE LIBERTY WHICH INSPIRES THE ENGLISH GENIUS IF PASSION AND PARTY SPIRIT DID NOT CORRUPT ALL THAT IS ESTIMABLE IN THIS PRECIOUS LIBERTY
IT IS TRUE I HAVE PREACHED A FEW BAD SERMONS THAT HAVE BROUGHT ME IN A LITTLE MONEY OF WHICH THE PRIOR STOLE HALF WHILE THE REST SERVES TO MAINTAIN MY GIRLS
I WISH THAT ALL THE THEATINS WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED A HUNDRED TIMES TO SET FIRE TO THE CONVENT AND GO AND BECOME A TURK
FOR WHETHER IN MID SEA OR AMONG THE BREAKERS OF THE FARTHER SHORE A WRECK MUST MARK AT LAST THE END OF EACH AND ALL AND EVERY LIFE NO MATTER IF ITS EVERY HOUR IS RICH WITH LOVE
WHY SHOULD WE FEAR THAT WHICH WILL COME TO ALL THAT IS WE CANNOT TELL WE DO NOT KNOW WHICH IS THE GREATEST BLESSING LIFE OR DEATH

THIS CATASTROPHE MADE A GREAT NOISE FOR SOME HOURS
THE POOR BARBARIAN WEEPING ABOVE HIS DEAD CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION AS INTELLIGENTLY AND SATISFACTORILY AS THE ROBED PRIEST OF THE MOST AUTHENTIC CREED
FOR MY PART I HAVE LONG SINCE RENOUNCED THOSE PALTRY ENTERTAINMENTS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE GLORY OF MODERN ITALY AND ARE PURCHASED SO DEARLY BY SOVEREIGNS
OH WHAT A SUPERIOR MAN SAID CANDIDE BELOW HIS BREATH WHAT A GREAT GENIUS IS THIS POCOCURANTE NOTHING CAN PLEASE HIM
PAQUETTE CONTINUED HER TRADE WHEREVER SHE WENT BUT MADE NOTHING OF IT
THEY INCLUDED DETECTIVE AND MISSUS GEORGE O MILLER AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO HAD GATHERED TO WITNESS THE BURIAL OF THE FORMER'S BRIGHT LITTLE SON HARRY AS THE CASKET RESTED UPON THE TRESTLES THERE WAS A PAINFUL PAUSE
AND WHO WHILE MOSES REPRESENTS THE ETERNAL PRODUCING THE WORLD BY A WORD MAKES THE MESSIAH TAKE A GREAT PAIR OF COMPASSES FROM THE ARMOURY OF HEAVEN TO CIRCUMSCRIBE HIS WORK HOW CAN I HAVE ANY ESTEEM
MARTIN WAS FOR THROWING THE BARON INTO THE SEA CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP
ANOTHER LIFE IS NAUGHT UNLESS WE KNOW AND LOVE AGAIN THE ONES WHO LOVE US HERE THEY WHO STAND WITH BREAKING HEARTS AROUND THIS LITTLE GRAVE NEED HAVE NO FEAR
MARTIN FOUND THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF REASON IN POCOCURANTE'S REMARKS
YOU MAY WELL IMAGINE THAT NEITHER I NOR ANY ONE ELSE EVER OPENS THEM MARTIN SAW SOME SHELVES FILLED WITH ENGLISH BOOKS
FROM THE WONDROUS TREE OF LIFE THE BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FALL WITH RIPENED FRUIT AND IN THE COMMON BED OF EARTH PATRIARCHS AND BABES SLEEP SIDE BY SIDE
AND A FRIEND OF THE OPPRESSED A THOUSAND TIMES I HAVE HEARD HIM QUOTE THE WORDS FOR JUSTICE ALL PLACE A TEMPLE AND ALL SEASON SUMMER HE BELIEVED THAT HAPPINESS WAS THE ONLY GOOD
AND ONE THOUSAND TO FRIAR GIROFLEE I'LL ANSWER FOR IT SAID HE THAT WITH THIS THEY WILL BE HAPPY I DO NOT BELIEVE IT AT ALL SAID MARTIN YOU WILL PERHAPS WITH THESE PIASTRES ONLY RENDER THEM THE MORE UNHAPPY
I SAY WHAT I THINK AND I CARE VERY LITTLE WHETHER OTHERS THINK AS I DO
BUT THERE WAS NO NEWS OF CACAMBO
I MAKE THEM LIE WITH ME SOMETIMES FOR I AM VERY TIRED OF THE LADIES OF THE TOWN OF THEIR COQUETRIES OF THEIR JEALOUSIES OF THEIR QUARRELS OF THEIR HUMOURS OF THEIR PETTINESSES
HE CLIMBED THE HEIGHTS AND LEFT ALL SUPERSTITIONS FAR BELOW WHILE ON HIS FOREHEAD FELL THE GOLDEN DAWNING OF A GRANDER DAY HE LOVED THE BEAUTIFUL
COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
A GONDOLIER AN ABBE TO BE EXPOSED TO ABUSE AND INSULTS TO BE OFTEN REDUCED TO BORROWING A PETTICOAT ONLY TO GO AND HAVE IT RAISED BY A DISAGREEABLE MAN
I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY
AND EVERY MOMENT JEWELED WITH A JOY WILL AT ITS CLOSE BECOME A TRAGEDY
BUT IN THE NIGHT OF DEATH HOPE SEES A STAR AND LISTENING LOVE CAN HEAR THE RUSTLE OF A WING HE WHO SLEEPS HERE WHEN DYING MISTAKING THE APPROACH OF DEATH FOR THE RETURN OF HEALTH
IMMEDIATELY HE ACCOSTED THEM
OF THEIR PRIDES OF THEIR FOLLIES AND OF THE SONNETS WHICH ONE MUST MAKE OR HAVE MADE FOR THEM
TO BE ROBBED BY ONE OF WHAT ONE HAS EARNED FROM ANOTHER TO BE SUBJECT TO THE EXTORTIONS OF THE OFFICERS OF JUSTICE AND TO HAVE IN PROSPECT ONLY A FRIGHTFUL OLD AGE A HOSPITAL AND A DUNG HILL
OR HE WHO JOURNEYS ALL THE LENGTH OF LIFE'S UNEVEN ROAD PAINFULLY TAKING THE LAST SLOW STEPS WITH STAFF AND CRUTCH EVERY CRADLE ASKS US WHENCE AND EVERY COFFIN WHITHER
REPLIED THE SENATOR THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND AND NOT THREE DOZEN OF THEM GOOD FOR ANYTHING AS TO THOSE COLLECTIONS OF SERMONS WHICH ALTOGETHER ARE NOT WORTH A SINGLE PAGE OF SENECA AND THOSE HUGE VOLUMES OF THEOLOGY
ALAS SAID HE SOFTLY TO MARTIN I AM AFRAID THAT THIS MAN HOLDS OUR GERMAN POETS IN VERY GREAT CONTEMPT THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH HARM IN THAT SAID MARTIN
MOST EXQUISITE YET ONE OF THE MOST SAD AND MOURNFUL SERMONS THE FUNERAL OF
YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT MY DEAR MARTIN ALL IS MISERY AND ILLUSION HE FELL INTO A DEEP MELANCHOLY AND NEITHER WENT TO SEE THE OPERA NOR ANY OF THE OTHER DIVERSIONS OF THE CARNIVAL
FIRST TWO PRETTY GIRLS VERY NEATLY DRESSED SERVED THEM WITH CHOCOLATE WHICH WAS FROTHED EXCEEDINGLY WELL CANDIDE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM COMMENDING THEIR BEAUTY GRACE AND ADDRESS THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH CREATURES SAID THE SENATOR
REASON THE ONLY TORCH JUSTICE THE ONLY WORSHIPER HUMANITY THE ONLY RELIGION AND LOVE THE PRIEST HE ADDED TO THE SUM OF HUMAN JOY
DIED WHERE MANHOOD'S MORNING ALMOST TOUCHES NOON AND WHILE THE SHADOWS STILL WERE FALLING TOWARD THE WEST HE HAD NOT PASSED ON LIFE'S HIGHWAY THE STONE THAT MARKS THE HIGHEST POINT
I KNOW OF NOTHING IN SO BAD A TASTE SAID THE MASTER ALL YOU SEE HERE IS MERELY TRIFLING AFTER TO MORROW I WILL HAVE IT PLANTED WITH A NOBLER DESIGN
IN POINTING OUT FAULTS WHERE OTHERS SEE NOTHING BUT BEAUTIES THAT IS TO SAY REPLIED MARTIN THAT THERE IS SOME PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE WELL
THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
MASTER SAID HE WE COME TO BEG YOU TO TELL WHY SO STRANGE AN ANIMAL AS MAN WAS MADE
CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE WAS FATIGUED WITH HARD WORK AND CURSED HIS DESTINY PANGLOSS WAS IN DESPAIR AT NOT SHINING IN SOME GERMAN UNIVERSITY
BROKEN ONLY BY THE MOTHER'S SOBS UNTIL THE UNDERTAKER ADVANCED TOWARD A STOUT FLORID COMPLEXIONED GENTLEMAN IN THE PARTY AND WHISPERED TO HIM THE WORDS BEING INAUDIBLE TO THE LOOKERS ON
I GRANT SAID THE SENATOR THAT THE SECOND FOURTH AND SIXTH BOOKS OF HIS A ENEID ARE EXCELLENT
THOSE WHO WERE SINCERE HAVE OWNED TO ME THAT THE POEM MADE THEM FALL ASLEEP YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE IT IN THEIR LIBRARY AS A MONUMENT OF ANTIQUITY OR LIKE THOSE RUSTY MEDALS WHICH ARE NO LONGER OF USE IN COMMERCE
LET THAT BE AS IT MAY SAID CANDIDE BUT ONE THING CONSOLES ME I SEE THAT WE OFTEN MEET WITH THOSE WHOM WE EXPECTED NEVER TO SEE MORE SO THAT PERHAPS AS I HAVE FOUND MY RED SHEEP AND PAQUETTE
IN EXTREME MISERY THEY HAD SOON SQUANDERED THEIR THREE THOUSAND PIASTRES PARTED WERE RECONCILED QUARRELLED AGAIN
NEITHER CAN WE TELL WHICH IS THE MORE FORTUNATE THE CHILD DYING IN ITS MOTHER'S ARMS BEFORE ITS LIPS HAVE LEARNED TO FORM A WORD
FOR MARTIN HE WAS FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT HE WOULD BE AS BADLY OFF ELSEWHERE AND THEREFORE BORE THINGS PATIENTLY
CANDIDE HAD NOT VIEWED HER AS YET WITH ATTENTION HIS THOUGHTS BEING ENTIRELY TAKEN UP WITH CUNEGONDE BUT RECOLLECTING HER AS SHE SPOKE
THE TEARFUL IGNORANCE OF THE ONE IS JUST AS CONSOLING AS THE LEARNED AND UNMEANING WORDS OF THE OTHER
YOU SEE THAT ALREADY I HAVE WON HALF THE WAGER FRIAR GIROFLEE STAYED IN THE DINING ROOM AND DRANK A GLASS OR TWO OF WINE WHILE HE WAS WAITING FOR DINNER BUT SAID CANDIDE TO PAQUETTE YOU LOOKED SO GAY AND CONTENT WHEN I MET YOU
TOOK PLACE AT HIS RESIDENCE IN WASHINGTON D C JUNE SECOND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE CEREMONIES WERE EXTREMELY SIMPLE CONSISTING MERELY OF VIEWING THE REMAINS BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS AND A FUNERAL ORATION BY COLONEL ROBERT G INGERSOLL
I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
MAYBE A COMMON FAITH TREADS FROM OUT THE PATHS BETWEEN OUR HEARTS THE WEEDS OF SELFISHNESS AND I SHOULD RATHER LIVE AND LOVE WHERE DEATH IS KING THAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE WHERE LOVE IS NOT
ARE ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST TASTE AND HIS LONG DESCRIPTION OF A PEST HOUSE IS GOOD ONLY FOR A GRAVE DIGGER
THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS A MAN OF SIXTY AND VERY RICH HE RECEIVED THE TWO TRAVELLERS WITH POLITE INDIFFERENCE WHICH PUT CANDIDE A LITTLE OUT OF COUNTENANCE BUT WAS NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO MARTIN
WHO COULD ILLUMINATE PRINCIPLE WITH THE WIDEST KNOWLEDGE A MAN WHOSE LEARNING ALMOST AMOUNTED TO A PROOF OF WHATEVER HE BELIEVED DOROTHEA'S INFERENCES MAY SEEM LARGE
THE AUCTIONEER SAID MISTER LEWIS TWENTY FIVE AND MISTER LEWIS'S CHIEF THUS BECAME THE PROPRIETOR OF THE LITTLE SQUARE PIANO HAVING EFFECTED THE PURCHASE HE SATE UP AS IF HE WAS GREATLY RELIEVED AND THE UNSUCCESSFUL COMPETITORS CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF HIM AT THIS MOMENT
I HAVE LITTLE LEISURE FOR SUCH LITERATURE JUST NOW I HAVE BEEN USING UP MY EYESIGHT ON OLD CHARACTERS LATELY THE FACT IS I WANT A READER FOR MY EVENINGS BUT I AM FASTIDIOUS IN VOICES
THE HALL SWARMS WITH DINGY GUESTS OF ORIENTAL COUNTENANCE
IF THAT LEARNED MAN WOULD ONLY TALK INSTEAD OF ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE TALKED TO BY MISTER BROOKE WHO WAS JUST THEN INFORMING HIM THAT THE REFORMATION EITHER MEANT SOMETHING OR IT DID NOT THAT HE HIMSELF WAS A PROTESTANT TO THE CORE
SHOW TEMPER DOROTHEA IT IS SO PAINFUL IN YOU CELIA THAT YOU WILL LOOK AT HUMAN BEINGS AS IF THEY WERE MERELY ANIMALS WITH A TOILET AND NEVER SEE THE GREAT SOUL IN A MAN'S FACE
AND LIVING ON WHO KNOWS WHAT WE SEE JACK THRIFTLESS PRANCING IN THE PARK OR DARTING IN HIS BROUGHAM DOWN PALL MALL WE EAT HIS DINNERS SERVED ON HIS MIRACULOUS PLATE HOW DID THIS BEGIN WE SAY OR WHERE WILL IT END
AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE BLOOMING ENGLISHMAN OF THE RED WHISKERED TYPE REPRESENTED BY SIR JAMES CHETTAM I AM READING THE AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY SAID THIS EXCELLENT BARONET
RANSACKED BY BROKERS AND BARGAINERS AND ITS QUIET FAMILY TREASURES GIVEN UP TO PUBLIC DESECRATION AND PLUNDER A MONTH AFTER HER FLIGHT
I DINED WITH HIM YEARS AGO AT CARTWRIGHT'S AND WORDSWORTH WAS THERE TOO THE POET WORDSWORTH YOU KNOW NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SINGULAR
ANSWERED DOROTHEA REDDENING UNLIKE CELIA SHE RARELY BLUSHED AND ONLY FROM HIGH DELIGHT OR ANGER AT THIS MOMENT SHE FELT ANGRY WITH THE PERVERSE SIR JAMES WHY DID HE NOT PAY ATTENTION TO CELIA
WHEREAS THE REMARK LAY IN HIS MIND AS LIGHTLY AS THE BROKEN WING OF AN INSECT AMONG ALL THE OTHER FRAGMENTS THERE AND A CHANCE CURRENT HAD SENT IT ALIGHTING ON HER WHEN THE TWO GIRLS WERE IN THE DRAWING ROOM ALONE CELIA SAID
THE WIFE CONTINUED SENTIMENTALLY FIVE AND TWENTY GUINEAS WAS MONSTROUSLY DEAR FOR THAT LITTLE PIANO
A LITTLE SQUARE PIANO WHICH CAME DOWN FROM THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE HOUSE THE STATE GRAND PIANO HAVING BEEN DISPOSED OF PREVIOUSLY THIS THE YOUNG LADY TRIED WITH A RAPID AND SKILFUL HAND MAKING THE OFFICER BLUSH AND START AGAIN
HOWEVER SINCE MISS BROOKE HAD BECOME ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER CASAUBON ABOUT THE VAUDOIS CLERGY SIR JAMES BETOOK HIMSELF TO CELIA
AND FOR IT WHEN ITS TURN CAME HER AGENT BEGAN TO BID BUT THERE WAS AN OPPOSITION HERE
AND HOW COURTEOUS AND FRIENDLY MEN WHO SLANDERED AND HATED EACH OTHER EVERYWHERE ELSE
EXACTLY SAID SIR JAMES
IT IS NOT OUR PURPOSE TO MAKE MENTION
SPOKE OF A HOUSE IN TOWN AND ASKED WHETHER MISS BROOKE DISLIKED LONDON AWAY FROM HER SISTER CELIA TALKED QUITE EASILY
AS YOU PASSED UP THE COMFORTABLE STAIR SOUNDED YOUR NAME FROM LANDING TO LANDING UNTIL IT REACHED THE APARTMENT WHERE JOLLY OLD DIVES WELCOMED HIS FRIENDS WHAT A NUMBER OF THEM HE HAD AND WHAT A NOBLE WAY OF ENTERTAINING THEM
HE DELIVERED HIMSELF WITH PRECISION AS IF HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND THE BALANCED SING SONG NEATNESS OF HIS SPEECH OCCASIONALLY CORRESPONDED TO BY A MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD
NOT EXCEPTING EVEN MONSIEUR LIRET THE VAUDOIS CLERGYMAN WHO HAD GIVEN CONFERENCES ON THE HISTORY OF THE WALDENSES TO RECONSTRUCT A PAST WORLD DOUBTLESS WITH A VIEW TO THE HIGHEST PURPOSES OF TRUTH
ROARED MISTER HAMMERDOWN PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN ON AN ELEPHANT WHO'LL BID FOR THE GENTLEMAN ON THE ELEPHANT LIFT UP THE PICTURE BLOWMAN AND LET THE COMPANY EXAMINE THIS LOT A LONG PALE MILITARY LOOKING GENTLEMAN
THE JUNIOR OF THE HOUSE WHO PURCHASED THE SPOONS FOR THE FIRM WAS IN FACT VERY SWEET UPON AMELIA AND OFFERED FOR HER IN SPITE OF ALL HE MARRIED MISS LOUISA CUTTS DAUGHTER OF HIGHAM AND CUTTS THE EMINENT CORNFACTORS
MY LORD DIVES'S REMAINS ARE IN THE FAMILY VAULT THE STATUARIES ARE CUTTING AN INSCRIPTION VERACIOUSLY COMMEMORATING HIS VIRTUES AND THE SORROWS OF HIS HEIR WHO IS DISPOSING OF HIS GOODS
WANDERING ABOUT THE WORLD AND TRYING MENTALLY TO CONSTRUCT IT AS IT USED TO BE IN SPITE OF RUIN AND CONFUSING CHANGES BUT I FIND IT NECESSARY TO USE THE UTMOST CAUTION ABOUT MY EYESIGHT
WHY SHOULD I MAKE IT BEFORE THE OCCASION CAME IT IS A GOOD COMPARISON THE MATCH IS PERFECT MISS BROOKE WAS CLEARLY FORGETTING HERSELF AND CELIA THOUGHT SO I WONDER YOU
THE HEBREW AIDE DE CAMP IN THE SERVICE OF THE OFFICER AT THE TABLE BID AGAINST THE HEBREW GENTLEMAN EMPLOYED BY THE ELEPHANT PURCHASERS AND A BRISK BATTLE ENSUED OVER THIS LITTLE PIANO THE COMBATANTS BEING GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY MISTER HAMMERDOWN AT LAST
HE AT THE TABLE LOOKED MORE SURPRISED AND DISCOMPOSED THAN EVER WHEN HE SPIED THIS PAIR AND HIS HEAD SANK INTO HIS MILITARY COLLAR AND HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON THEM SO AS TO AVOID THEM ALTOGETHER
OF EFFORT AH PIGEON HOLES WILL NOT DO I HAVE TRIED PIGEON HOLES BUT EVERYTHING GETS MIXED IN PIGEON HOLES
THESE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HER THE LITTLE DINNERS THE LAUGHING AND CHATTING THE MUSIC AFTERWARDS DELIGHTED ALL WHO PARTICIPATED IN THESE ENJOYMENTS
WAS THE MORE CONSPICUOUS FROM ITS CONTRAST WITH GOOD MISTER BROOKE'S SCRAPPY SLOVENLINESS
AND OVER WHICH THE LATE MISTER GEORGE ROBINS USED TO PRESIDE WITH SO MUCH DIGNITY THERE ARE VERY FEW LONDON PEOPLE AS I FANCY WHO HAVE NOT ATTENDED AT THESE MEETINGS AND ALL WITH A TASTE FOR MORALIZING MUST HAVE THOUGHT
THE FACT IS HUMAN REASON MAY CARRY YOU A LITTLE TOO FAR OVER THE HEDGE IN FACT IT CARRIED ME A GOOD WAY AT ONE TIME BUT I SAW IT WOULD NOT DO I PULLED UP I PULLED UP IN TIME
HE WAS RATHER DULL PERHAPS BUT WOULD NOT SUCH WINE MAKE ANY CONVERSATION PLEASANT WE MUST GET SOME OF HIS BURGUNDY AT ANY PRICE THE MOURNERS CRY AT HIS CLUB
SENT THIS LITTLE SPAR OUT OF THE WRECK WITH THEIR LOVE TO GOOD MISSUS SEDLEY AND WITH RESPECT TO THE PIANO AS IT HAD BEEN AMELIA'S AND AS SHE MIGHT MISS IT AND WANT ONE NOW AND AS CAPTAIN WILLIAM DOBBIN COULD NO MORE PLAY UPON IT THAN HE COULD DANCE ON THE TIGHT ROPE
IT IS NOT A SIN TO MAKE YOURSELF POOR IN PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS FOR THE GOOD OF ALL SHE SPOKE WITH MORE ENERGY THAN IS EXPECTED OF SO YOUNG A LADY BUT SIR JAMES HAD APPEALED TO HER HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO SO
HIS MANNERS SHE THOUGHT WERE VERY DIGNIFIED THE SET OF HIS IRON GRAY HAIR AND HIS DEEP EYE SOCKETS MADE HIM RESEMBLE THE PORTRAIT OF LOCKE HE HAD THE SPARE FORM AND THE PALE COMPLEXION WHICH BECAME A STUDENT
AND GIVE THEM DRAINING TILES YOU KNOW BUT YOUR FANCY FARMING WILL NOT DO THE MOST EXPENSIVE SORT OF WHISTLE YOU CAN BUY YOU MAY AS WELL KEEP A PACK OF HOUNDS
AS POTIPHAR WAS ONLY IN A DIFFERENT WAY BY THESE ATTENTIONS THAT VETERAN RAKE
HIS FORMER HAUNTS KNEW HIM NOT THEY ASKED ABOUT HIM ONCE OR TWICE AT HIS CLUBS BUT DID NOT MISS HIM MUCH
ABOUT THIS OR THAT WHO COULD HELP HER HUSBAND OUT WITH REASONS
THIS DONE JOS WENT ON AT THE BOARDING HOUSE AT CHELTENHAM PRETTY MUCH AS BEFORE HE DROVE HIS CURRICLE HE DRANK HIS CLARET HE PLAYED HIS RUBBER HE TOLD HIS INDIAN STORIES
I AM SURE HER REASONS WOULD DO HER HONOR HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST JEALOUS OF THE INTEREST WITH WHICH DOROTHEA HAD LOOKED UP AT MISTER CASAUBON IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT A GIRL TO WHOM HE WAS MEDITATING AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE
LAUGHABLE AND TEARFUL WHERE YOU MAY BE GENTLE AND PATHETIC OR SAVAGE AND CYNICAL WITH PERFECT PROPRIETY IT IS AT ONE OF THOSE PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES A CROWD OF WHICH ARE ADVERTISED EVERY DAY IN THE LAST PAGE OF THE TIMES NEWSPAPER
PRETTY THING IS IT NOT SWEET MINIATURE
IF YOU WILL ONLY MENTION THE TIME THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY GOOD I MEAN TO GIVE UP RIDING I SHALL NOT RIDE ANY MORE SAID DOROTHEA URGED TO THIS BRUSQUE RESOLUTION BY A LITTLE ANNOYANCE THAT SIR JAMES WOULD BE SOLICITING HER ATTENTION
BUT NOT TOO HARD I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN FAVOR OF A LITTLE THEORY WE MUST HAVE THOUGHT ELSE WE SHALL BE LANDED BACK IN THE DARK AGES BUT TALKING OF BOOKS THERE IS SOUTHEY'S PENINSULAR WAR
THAT NEVER EXPLAINED SCIENCE WHICH WAS THRUST AS AN EXTINGUISHER OVER ALL HER LIGHTS BUT YOU ARE FOND OF RIDING MISS BROOKE SIR JAMES PRESENTLY TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD ENTER A LITTLE INTO THE PLEASURES OF HUNTING
I MIGHT MAKE SOMETHING OF HIM BUT SHE NEVER LET HIM PERCEIVE THE OPINION SHE HAD OF HIM
GOOD OLD JOHN SEDLEY WAS A RUINED MAN HIS NAME HAD BEEN PROCLAIMED AS A DEFAULTER ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE
AND THERE SAW ANOTHER OFFICER WITH A YOUNG LADY ON HIS ARM WHO BOTH APPEARED TO BE HIGHLY AMUSED WITH THE SCENE AND TO WHOM FINALLY
MISTER CASAUBON HAD COME UP TO THE TABLE TEACUP IN HAND AND WAS LISTENING WE MUST NOT INQUIRE TOO CURIOUSLY INTO MOTIVES HE INTERPOSED IN HIS MEASURED WAY
IN THE BEGINNING OF DINNER THE PARTY BEING SMALL AND THE ROOM STILL THESE MOTES FROM THE MASS OF A MAGISTRATE'S MIND FELL TOO NOTICEABLY SHE WONDERED HOW A MAN LIKE MISTER CASAUBON WOULD SUPPORT SUCH TRIVIALITY
NO INDEED NOT EXACTLY
AND MISTER HAMMERDOWN IS SITTING ON THE GREAT MAHOGANY DINING TABLES IN THE DINING ROOM BELOW WAVING THE IVORY HAMMER AND EMPLOYING ALL THE ARTIFICES OF ELOQUENCE ENTHUSIASM ENTREATY REASON DESPAIR
ANNA MARIA ROAD WEST WHERE THE HOUSES LOOK LIKE BABY HOUSES WHERE THE PEOPLE LOOKING OUT OF THE FIRST FLOOR WINDOWS MUST INFALLIBLY AS YOU THINK SIT WITH THEIR FEET IN THE PARLOURS
AND ONE DOZEN DESSERT DITTO DITTO THERE WERE THREE YOUNG STOCKBROKERS MESSRS DALE SPIGGOT AND DALE OF THREADNEEDLE STREET INDEED WHO HAVING HAD DEALINGS WITH THE OLD MAN
BECAUSE I AM GOING TO TAKE ONE OF THE FARMS INTO MY OWN HANDS AND SEE IF SOMETHING CANNOT BE DONE IN SETTING A GOOD PATTERN OF FARMING AMONG MY TENANTS DO YOU APPROVE OF THAT MISS BROOKE A
AS TO THE EXCESSIVE RELIGIOUSNESS ALLEGED AGAINST MISS BROOKE HE HAD A VERY INDEFINITE NOTION OF WHAT IT CONSISTED IN AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD DIE OUT WITH MARRIAGE IN SHORT
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE DID NOT PURCHASE THE INSTRUMENT FOR HIS OWN USE IN A WORD IT ARRIVED THAT EVENING AT A WONDERFUL SMALL COTTAGE IN A STREET LEADING FROM THE FULHAM ROAD ONE OF THOSE STREETS WHICH HAVE THE FINEST ROMANTIC NAMES THIS WAS CALLED SAINT ADELAIDE VILLAS
NEVER WAS IN ACTION MY DEAR ASK MARTINGALE HE WAS IN SPAIN AIDE DE CAMP TO GENERAL BLAZES HE WAS A VERY KIND OLD MAN MISTER SEDLEY REBECCA SAID I'M REALLY SORRY HE'S GONE WRONG
THE LADY SAID TO HER FRIEND WHY RAWDON IT'S CAPTAIN DOBBIN I SUPPOSE BECKY WAS DISCONTENTED WITH THE NEW PIANO HER HUSBAND HAD HIRED FOR HER OR PERHAPS THE PROPRIETORS OF THAT INSTRUMENT HAD FETCHED IT AWAY DECLINING FARTHER CREDIT
OR WILL BE INSTRUCTED BY THE EXECUTORS TO OFFER TO PUBLIC COMPETITION THE LIBRARY FURNITURE PLATE WARDROBE
ITS HOT RAYS COOLED HIM OFF SOMEWHAT SO THAT HE BEGAN LOOKING ABOUT CURIOUSLY AT ALL THE STRANGE SIGHTS AND WONDERING WHERE ON EARTH HE WAS BY AND BY A FARMER CAME ALONG THE ROAD BY THE RIVER
AND TIPPED BACK THEIR HEADS AND WATCHED THE BALLOON GO HIGHER AND HIGHER UNTIL FINALLY THE MAN REACHED OUT AND CAUGHT HOLD OF THE EDGE OF THE MOON AND BEHOLD THE NEXT MINUTE HE WAS THE MAN IN THE MOON AGAIN
THEY REMAINED THERE DURING THE WINTER WHICH HAPPENED TO BE A HARD ONE WITH NO WORK DOING AND THEY WERE BADLY OFF FOR FOOD AND THE FISHING FAILED THEN THEY WENT OUT TO THE ISLAND HOPING THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE GOT THERE FROM FISHING OR FROM WHAT WAS DRIFTED ASHORE
WHAT S A GOOD PLACE TO VISIT DOWN THERE ENQUIRED THE MAN IN THE MOON OH NORWICH IS A MIGHTY FINE PLACE RETURNED THE ALDERMAN
WITH BOTH EYES AND MOUTH AND NOSTRILS WIDE OPEN CLAWING AND PINCHING HIMSELF AND RECITING SOMETHING THEY ASKED WHY HE HAD COME THERE HE REPLIED THAT IT WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE BEGGED THEM NOT TO WONDER THEREAT
TO A RIDGE ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND FEET HIGH COMMANDING A GENERAL VIEW OF THE MAIN SUMMITS ALONG THE AXIS OF THE RANGE FEELING ASSURED I SHOULD FIND THEM BANNERED STILL MORE GLORIOUSLY
THE MAGISTRATE LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT IN SURPRISE AND THEN HE SAID THIS PERSON IS EVIDENTLY CRAZY SO TAKE HIM TO THE LUNATIC ASYLUM AND KEEP HIM THERE
WITH NOTHING TO BLUR THE SUBLIME PICTURE THEY MADE FANCY YOURSELF STANDING BESIDE ME ON THIS YOSEMITE RIDGE THERE IS A STRANGE GARISH GLITTER IN THE AIR AND THE GALE DRIVES WILDLY OVERHEAD
TO THE SEA BUT THOUGH SNOW DUST AND STORM WINDS ABOUND ON THE MOUNTAINS REGULAR SHAPELY BANNERS ARE FOR CAUSES WE SHALL PRESENTLY SEE SELDOM PRODUCED
AND CUT IT UP AND STILL THEY KNEW NOT WHAT KIND OF WHALE IT WAS EVEN KARLSEFNI RECOGNISED IT NOT THOUGH HE HAD GREAT KNOWLEDGE OF WHALES IT WAS COOKED BY THE COOK BOYS AND THEY ATE THEREOF THOUGH BAD EFFECTS CAME UPON ALL FROM IT AFTERWARDS
WHILE THUS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR A SMALL PORTION ESCAPES FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SKY AS VAPOR BUT FAR THE GREATER PART IS AT LENGTH LOCKED FAST IN BOSSY OVERCURLING CORNICES ALONG THE RIDGES
WILL YOU HAVE IT HOT OR COLD SIR OH COLD BY ALL MEANS REPLIED THE MAN FOR I DETEST ANYTHING HOT TO EAT SHE SOON BROUGHT HIM A BOWL OF COLD PEASE PORRIDGE
THE NIGHTS ARE TOO HOT WHY
THORHALL DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT AND THEY WENT TO SEEK HIM AND SOUGHT FOR THREE HALF DAYS CONTINUOUSLY ON THE FOURTH HALF DAY KARLSEFNI AND BJARNI FOUND HIM ON THE PEAK OF A CRAG HE LAY WITH HIS FACE TO THE SKY
THEN BEGAN THORHALL AND SAID HAS IT NOT BEEN THAT THE REDBEARD HAS PROVED A BETTER FRIEND THAN YOUR CHRIST THIS WAS MY GIFT FOR THE POETRY WHICH I COMPOSED ABOUT THOR MY PATRON SELDOM HAS HE FAILED ME
IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THOU ART SOMEWHAT MORE TACITURN THAN THOU HAST BEEN STILL THOU HELPEST US WITH MUCH LIBERALITY
IN THAT SPOT THERE WAS LITTLE HOWEVER TO BE GOT FOR FOOD BUT THEIR CATTLE FOUND GOOD SUSTENANCE AFTER THAT THEY CALLED UPON GOD PRAYING THAT HE WOULD SEND THEM SOME LITTLE STORE OF MEAT BUT THEIR PRAYER WAS NOT SO SOON GRANTED AS THEY WERE EAGER THAT IT SHOULD BE
NOR WAS I IN THE LEAST DISAPPOINTED I REACHED THE TOP OF THE RIDGE IN FOUR OR FIVE HOURS AND THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE WOODS THE MOST IMPOSING WIND STORM EFFECT I EVER BEHELD
AND PUT A FEW LUMPS OF ICE IN THE STOVE TO KEEP HIM WARM AND SAT DOWN TO THINK HOW HE SHOULD MANAGE THE TRIP YOU SEE EVERYTHING WENT BY CONTRARIES IN THE MOON AND WHEN THE MAN WISHED TO KEEP WARM
WELL THE MAN IN THE I MEAN THE MAN
SOUTHERN SLOPES FROM PEAK TO PEAK LIKE WHITE PEARLY FOG IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT SHADOWS IN GREAT PART DETERMINE NOT ONLY THE FORMS OF LOFTY ICE MOUNTAINS
THEN THEY SAILED WITH NORTHERLY WINDS TWO HALF DAYS AND THERE WAS THEN LAND BEFORE THEM AND ON IT A GREAT FOREST AND MANY WILD BEASTS AN ISLAND LAY IN THE SOUTH EAST OFF THE LAND AND THEY FOUND BEARS THEREON
BECAUSE IT WAS TEDIOUS TO SAIL BY THEM THEN THE COAST BECAME INDENTED WITH CREEKS AND THEY DIRECTED THEIR SHIPS ALONG THE CREEKS NOW BEFORE THIS WHEN LEIF WAS WITH KING OLAF TRYGGVASON AND THE KING HAD REQUESTED HIM TO PREACH CHRISTIANITY IN GREENLAND
AS IF CELEBRATING SOME SURPASSINGLY GLORIOUS EVENT THE SNOW OF WHICH THESE BANNERS ARE MADE FALLS ON THE HIGH SIERRA IN MOST EXTRAVAGANT ABUNDANCE SOMETIMES TO A DEPTH OF FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FEET
IT MUST BE VASTLY MORE PLEASANT TO HAVE COMPANIONS TO TALK TO THAN TO BE SHUT UP IN A BIG PLANET ALL BY HIMSELF WHERE HE HAD TO WHISTLE TO KEEP HIMSELF COMPANY ONE DAY
AND THE MAN WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE TOOK A BIG SPOONFUL AT ONCE BUT NO SOONER HAD HE PUT IT INTO HIS MOUTH THAN HE UTTERED A GREAT YELL AND BEGAN DANCING FRANTICALLY ABOUT THE ROOM FOR OF COURSE
CAME IN SIGHT OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE SOUTH DOME EACH WAVING A WHITE GLOWING BANNER AGAINST THE DARK BLUE SKY AS REGULAR IN FORM AND FIRM AND FINE IN TEXTURE
TO STAY WITH EIRIK DURING THE WINTER WHEN NOW YULE WAS DRAWING NIGH EIRIK BEGAN TO LOOK MORE GLOOMY THAN HE WAS WONT TO BE PRESENTLY KARLSEFNI ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM AND SAID ART THOU IN TROUBLE EIRIK
SURELY THIS IS THE TOWN OF NORWICH RETURNED THE WOMAN I CAME HERE TO SEE IF I COULD GET SOME PEASE PORRIDGE CONTINUED THE MAN
AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO DO NEXT I D LIKE TO GET BACK TO THE MOON SAID THE MAN
FOR BY THIS TIME HE WAS VERY HUNGRY INDEED A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN ANSWERED HIS KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND HE ASKED POLITELY IS THIS THE TOWN OF NORWICH MADAM
THAT IT WILL SEEM TO ME AN ILL THING IF IT IS HEARD THAT YOU NEVER SPENT A WORSE YULE THAN THIS JUST NOW BEGINNING WHEN EIRIK THE RED ENTERTAINED YOU AT BRATTAHLID IN GREENLAND KARLSEFNI ANSWERED IT MUST NOT COME TO SUCH A PASS
THE MERCHANTS ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND WENT HOME WITH EIRIK AFTERWARDS THEIR MERCHANDISE WAS REMOVED TO BRATTAHLID WHERE A GOOD AND LARGE OUTHOUSE WAS NOT LACKING IN WHICH TO STORE THE GOODS THE MERCHANTS WERE WELL PLEASED
WHAT HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THE STORY OF THE MAN IN THE MOON THEN I MUST SURELY TELL IT FOR IT IS VERY AMUSING AND THERE IS NOT A WORD OF TRUTH IN IT
I SAW ONLY ONE BANNER STORM THAT SEEMED IN EVERY WAY PERFECT THIS WAS IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE WHEN THE SNOW LADEN PEAKS WERE SWEPT BY A POWERFUL NORTHER
AND WHAT WAS COLD HERE WAS HOT THERE SO HE BEGAN TO THINK THE MAN HAD TOLD THE TRUTH THEREFORE HE BEGGED THE MAGISTRATE TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES WHILE HE LOOKED THROUGH HIS TELESCOPE TO SEE IF THE MAN IN THE MOON WAS THERE
AND TRANSLUCENT TOWARD THE END SO THAT THE PARTS OF THE PEAKS PAST WHICH THEY ARE STREAMING LOOK DIM AS IF SEEN THROUGH A VEIL OF GROUND GLASS AND SEE HOW SOME OF THE LONGEST OF THE BANNERS
LET ME LOOK AT YOUR MOUTH SIR AND SEE IF IT IS REALLY BURNED THEN THE MAN OPENED HIS MOUTH AND EVERYONE SAW PLAINLY IT WAS BURNED TO A BLISTER THEREUPON THE MAGISTRATE BEGGED HIS PARDON FOR DOUBTING HIS WORD
MANY AND SO GREAT THAT TWO MEN MIGHT WELL LIE ON THEM STRETCHED ON THEIR BACKS WITH HEEL TO HEEL POLAR FOXES WERE THERE IN ABUNDANCE THIS LAND THEY GAVE NAME TO AND CALLED IT HELLULAND
WHICH BELONGS TO THE CIRCUS THAT CAME HERE LAST SUMMER AND WAS PAWNED FOR A BOARD BILL WE CAN INFLATE THIS BALLOON AND SEND THE MAN OUT OF THE MOON HOME IN IT
THANK YOU SAID THE MAN IN THE MOON BUT STOP I MUST NOT CALL HIM THE MAN IN THE MOON ANY LONGER FOR OF COURSE HE WAS NOW OUT OF THE MOON SO I LL SIMPLY CALL HIM THE MAN AND YOU LL KNOW BY THAT WHICH MAN I MEAN
I WAS AWAKENED EARLY IN THE MORNING BY A WILD STORM WIND AND OF COURSE I HAD TO MAKE HASTE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY TO ENJOY IT RUGGED TORRENTS AND AVALANCHES
DURING THIS TIME MUCH TALK TOOK PLACE IN BRATTAHLID ABOUT MAKING READY TO GO TO VINLAND THE GOOD AND IT WAS ASSERTED
IS PREPARED FOR THE GRAND BANNER WAVING CELEBRATIONS BY THE ACTION OF THE WIND INSTEAD OF AT ONCE FINDING REST LIKE THAT WHICH FALLS INTO THE TRANQUIL DEPTHS OF THE FOREST IT IS SHOVED
I LL TELL YOU WHAT WE CAN DO REMARKED THE ASTRONOMER
OVERBEARING IN TEMPER OF MELANCHOLY MOOD SILENT AT ALL TIMES UNDERHAND IN HIS DEALINGS AND WITHAL GIVEN TO ABUSE AND ALWAYS INCLINED TOWARDS THE WORST HE HAD KEPT HIMSELF ALOOF FROM THE TRUE FAITH WHEN IT CAME TO GREENLAND
THE MAN IN THE MOON
FROM THE MAIN WIND FLOOD OVERHEAD WERE ROARING DOWN THE SIDE CANYONS AND OVER THE CLIFFS AROUSING THE ROCKS AND THE TREES AND THE STREAMS ALIKE INTO GLORIOUS HURRAHING ENTHUSIASM
BUT IT WAS N'T AT ALL QUEER TO THE MAN IN THE MOON FOR HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO IT WELL HE SAT BY HIS ICE COOL FIRE AND THOUGHT ABOUT HIS JOURNEY TO THE EARTH AND FINALLY HE DECIDED THE ONLY WAY HE COULD GET THERE
FOR A GOOD STRONG MOONBEAM AT LAST HE FOUND ONE THAT SEEMED RATHER SUBSTANTIAL AND REACHED RIGHT DOWN TO A PLEASANT LOOKING SPOT ON THE EARTH AND SO HE SWUNG HIMSELF OVER THE EDGE OF THE MOON
COME COME NO NONSENSE SAID THE MAGISTRATE YOU MUST HAVE SOME NAME WHO ARE YOU WHY I M THE MAN IN THE MOON THAT S RUBBISH SAID THE MAGISTRATE EYEING THE PRISONER SEVERELY YOU MAY BE A MAN
THEY ARE TWENTY MILES AWAY BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH THEM NEARER FOR EVERY FEATURE IS DISTINCT AND THE WHOLE WONDERFUL SHOW IS SEEN IN ITS RIGHT PROPORTIONS LIKE A PAINTING ON THE SKY
BUT YOU FEEL NOTHING OF ITS VIOLENCE FOR YOU ARE LOOKING OUT THROUGH A SHELTERED OPENING IN THE WOODS AS THROUGH A WINDOW IN THE IMMEDIATE FOREGROUND THERE IS A FOREST OF SILVER FIR
THERE WERE SO MANY BIRDS ON IT THAT SCARCELY WAS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT ONE'S FEET DOWN FOR THE EGGS THEY CONTINUED THEIR COURSE UP THE FIRTH WHICH THEY CALLED STRAUMSFJORDR AND CARRIED THEIR CARGO ASHORE FROM THE SHIPS AND THERE THEY PREPARED TO STAY
THEY HAD WITH THEM CATTLE OF ALL KINDS AND FOR THEMSELVES THEY SOUGHT OUT THE PRODUCE OF THE LAND THEREABOUT THERE WERE MOUNTAINS AND THE PLACE WAS FAIR TO LOOK UPON THEY GAVE NO HEED TO ANYTHING EXCEPT TO EXPLORE THE LAND AND THEY FOUND LARGE PASTURES
AND JOSEPH SEDLEY WAS ACTUALLY POLITE ENOUGH TO CARRY THE CANDLES TO THE PIANO OSBORNE HINTED THAT HE SHOULD LIKE QUITE AS WELL TO SIT IN THE DARK BUT MISS SEDLEY LAUGHING DECLINED TO BEAR HIM COMPANY ANY FARTHER
IN A WORD GEORGE WAS AS FAMILIAR WITH THE FAMILY AS SUCH DAILY ACTS OF KINDNESS AND INTERCOURSE COULD MAKE HIM DO YOU REMEMBER SEDLEY WHAT A FURY YOU WERE IN WHEN I CUT OFF THE TASSELS OF YOUR HESSIAN BOOTS AND HOW MISS HEM
AND AT THIS MOMENT MISTER SAMBO MADE HIS APPEARANCE WITH A TRAY CONTAINING SANDWICHES JELLIES AND SOME GLITTERING GLASSES AND DECANTERS ON WHICH JOSEPH SEDLEY'S ATTENTION WAS IMMEDIATELY FIXED
SIR AND MISTER SAMBO TO THE DELIGHT OF THAT ATTENDANT
AND SMELT THEM DELICATELY AND HELD THEM TO HER BOSOM AND CAST UP HER EYES TO THE CEILING IN AN ECSTASY OF ADMIRATION PERHAPS SHE JUST LOOKED FIRST INTO THE BOUQUET TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS A BILLET DOUX HIDDEN AMONG THE FLOWERS
AND HE WAS VERY WITTY REGARDING THE NUMBER OF SCOTCHMEN WHOM LORD MINTO THE GOVERNOR GENERAL PATRONISED AND THEN HE DESCRIBED A TIGER HUNT AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE MAHOUT OF HIS ELEPHANT HAD BEEN PULLED OFF HIS SEAT BY ONE OF THE INFURIATED ANIMALS
THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE WAS TELLING A FIB HAD YOU HEARD REBECCA FIRST I GIVE MISS SHARP WARNING THOUGH SAID OSBORNE THAT RIGHT OR WRONG I CONSIDER MISS AMELIA SEDLEY THE FIRST SINGER IN THE WORLD YOU SHALL HEAR SAID AMELIA
BUT VOWED THAT HE HAD TOTALLY FORGOTTEN IT WELL DO YOU REMEMBER COMING DOWN IN A GIG TO DOCTOR SWISHTAIL'S TO SEE ME BEFORE YOU WENT TO INDIA AND GIVING ME HALF A GUINEA AND A PAT ON THE HEAD I ALWAYS HAD AN IDEA THAT YOU WERE AT LEAST SEVEN FEET HIGH
A WOMAN WITH FAIR OPPORTUNITIES AND WITHOUT AN ABSOLUTE HUMP MAY MARRY WHOM SHE LIKES ONLY LET US BE THANKFUL THAT THE DARLINGS ARE LIKE THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD AND DON'T KNOW THEIR OWN POWER THEY WOULD OVERCOME US ENTIRELY IF THEY DID
AND WHAT A SENSATION SHE WOULD MAKE AT THE CALCUTTA BALLS IT'S EVIDENT THE POOR DEVIL'S IN LOVE WITH ME THOUGHT HE SHE IS JUST AS RICH AS MOST OF THE GIRLS WHO COME OUT TO INDIA
AND THAT NIGHT IN A CONVERSATION WHICH TOOK PLACE IN A FRONT ROOM IN THE SECOND FLOOR IN A SORT OF TENT HUNG ROUND WITH CHINTZ OF A RICH AND FANTASTIC INDIA PATTERN AND DOUBLE WITH CALICO OF A TENDER ROSE COLOUR
JOSEPH PUFFING FROM THE STAIRCASE IN SHINING CREAKING BOOTS JOSEPH IN A NEW WAISTCOAT RED WITH HEAT AND NERVOUSNESS AND BLUSHING BEHIND HIS WADDED NECKCLOTH IT WAS A NERVOUS MOMENT FOR ALL
WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED AT THIS REMARK THOUGH HE DREW HIS LEGS UNDER HIS CHAIR AS IT WAS MADE MISS SHARP SAID GEORGE OSBORNE YOU WHO ARE SO CLEVER AN ARTIST YOU MUST MAKE A GRAND HISTORICAL PICTURE OF THE SCENE OF THE BOOTS
KNOWING GLANCES WERE TELEGRAPHED BETWEEN OSBORNE AND MISS SEDLEY AND THE PAIR SMILING ARCHLY LOOKED AT REBECCA WHO ACTUALLY BLUSHED AS SHE BENT HER FAIR RINGLETS OVER HER KNITTING HOW HER HEART BEAT AS JOSEPH APPEARED
AND THAT A WOMAN OF YOUR YEARS AND SIZE IS TO CATCH COLD IN SUCH AN ABOMINABLE DAMP PLACE THE CHILDREN MUST HAVE SOMEONE WITH THEM CRIED MISSUS SEDLEY LET JOE GO SAID HIS FATHER LAUGHING HE'S BIG ENOUGH
WHO FELT AT THAT MOMENT AN EXTRAORDINARY ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TO SEIZE THE ABOVE MENTIONED YOUNG WOMAN IN HIS ARMS AND TO KISS HER IN THE FACE OF THE COMPANY AND SHE LOOKED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT
WHEN MORNING CAME THE GOOD NATURED MISSUS SEDLEY NO LONGER THOUGHT OF EXECUTING HER THREATS WITH REGARD TO MISS SHARP FOR THOUGH NOTHING IS MORE KEEN NOR MORE COMMON NOR MORE JUSTIFIABLE THAN MATERNAL JEALOUSY
SAID THE COLLECTOR IT MADE ME CRY ALMOST PON MY HONOUR IT DID BECAUSE YOU HAVE A KIND HEART MISTER JOSEPH ALL THE SEDLEYS HAVE I THINK IT KEPT ME AWAKE LAST NIGHT AND I WAS TRYING TO HUM IT THIS MORNING IN BED
BUT THERE WAS NO LETTER DO THEY TALK THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS AT BOGGLEY WOLLAH SEDLEY ASKED OSBORNE LAUGHING POOH NONSENSE REPLIED THE SENTIMENTAL YOUTH BOUGHT EM AT NATHAN'S VERY GLAD YOU LIKE EM
AND IF I SHOULD SAY THAT THEY FELL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER AT THAT SINGLE INSTANT OF TIME I SHOULD PERHAPS BE TELLING AN UNTRUTH FOR THE FACT IS THAT THESE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN BRED UP BY THEIR PARENTS FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE
THAT EVERYBODY FELT HOW CRUEL HER LOT WAS AND HOW SORRY THEY WOULD BE TO PART WITH HER O THAT YOU COULD STAY LONGER DEAR REBECCA SAID AMELIA WHY ANSWERED THE OTHER STILL MORE SADLY
HOW DELIGHTED MISS REBECCA WAS AT THE GOVERNMENT BALLS AND HOW SHE LAUGHED AT THE STORIES OF THE SCOTCH AIDES DE CAMP AND CALLED MISTER SEDLEY A SAD WICKED SATIRICAL CREATURE AND HOW FRIGHTENED SHE WAS AT THE STORY OF THE ELEPHANT
HE DESCRIBED THE BALLS AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY KEPT THEMSELVES COOL IN THE HOT WEATHER WITH PUNKAHS TATTIES AND OTHER CONTRIVANCES
AND AS IT WAS RATHER DARK MISS AMELIA IN THE MOST UNAFFECTED WAY IN THE WORLD PUT HER HAND INTO MISTER OSBORNE'S WHO OF COURSE COULD SEE THE WAY AMONG THE CHAIRS AND OTTOMANS A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN SHE COULD
WAS A MATCH MAKER IN HER HEART AND WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED THAT JOSEPH SHOULD CARRY BACK A WIFE TO INDIA SHE HAD TOO IN THE COURSE OF THIS FEW DAYS CONSTANT INTERCOURSE WARMED INTO A MOST TENDER FRIENDSHIP FOR REBECCA
HERE IS EMMY'S LITTLE FRIEND MAKING LOVE TO HIM AS HARD AS SHE CAN THAT'S QUITE CLEAR AND IF SHE DOES NOT CATCH HIM SOME OTHER WILL THAT MAN IS DESTINED TO BE A PREY TO WOMAN AS I AM TO GO ON CHANGE EVERY DAY
OR WERE REPLACED BY THE GENTLE BUT UNROMANTIC MUSIC OF THE NOSE AND SAVE WHEN THE CHURCH BELLS TOLLED THE HOUR AND THE WATCHMAN CALLED IT ALL WAS SILENT AT THE HOUSE OF JOHN SEDLEY ESQUIRE OF RUSSELL SQUARE AND THE STOCK EXCHANGE
AMELIA HAD BETTER WRITE A NOTE SAID HER FATHER AND LET GEORGE OSBORNE SEE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HANDWRITING WE HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM MISS PINKERTON'S
WITHOUT THE LEAST TIMIDITY OR HESITATION TO A PERSON OF THE OTHER SEX MISS REBECCA ASKED HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT INDIA WHICH GAVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF NARRATING MANY INTERESTING ANECDOTES ABOUT THAT COUNTRY AND HIMSELF
AND BEARING TWO HANDSOME NOSEGAYS OF FLOWERS WHICH THE MONSTER HAD ACTUALLY HAD THE GALLANTRY TO PURCHASE IN COVENT GARDEN MARKET THAT MORNING THEY WERE NOT AS BIG AS THE HAYSTACKS WHICH LADIES CARRY ABOUT WITH THEM NOW A DAYS IN CONES OF FILIGREE PAPER
AND IN WHICH BRITISH TARS OUR KING POOR SUSAN BLUE EYED MARY AND THE LIKE WERE THE PRINCIPAL THEMES THEY ARE NOT IT IS SAID VERY BRILLIANT IN A MUSICAL POINT OF VIEW BUT CONTAIN NUMBERLESS GOOD NATURED SIMPLE APPEALS TO THE AFFECTIONS
JOS INSTANTLY RELAPSED INTO AN ALARMED SILENCE AND QUICKLY TOOK HIS DEPARTURE HE DID NOT LIE AWAKE ALL NIGHT THINKING WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH MISS SHARP THE PASSION OF LOVE NEVER INTERFERED WITH THE APPETITE OR THE SLUMBER OF MISTER JOSEPH SEDLEY
DURING THE DRINKING OF WHICH SEDLEY TOLD A NUMBER OF HIS BEST INDIAN STORIES FOR HE WAS EXTREMELY TALKATIVE IN MAN'S SOCIETY AND AFTERWARDS MISS AMELIA SEDLEY DID THE HONOURS OF THE DRAWING ROOM AND THESE FOUR YOUNG PERSONS PASSED SUCH A COMFORTABLE EVENING TOGETHER
AND DISCOVERED A MILLION OF VIRTUES AND AMIABLE QUALITIES IN HER WHICH SHE HAD NOT PERCEIVED WHEN THEY WERE AT CHISWICK TOGETHER FOR THE AFFECTION OF YOUNG LADIES IS OF AS RAPID GROWTH AS JACK'S BEAN STALK AND REACHES UP TO THE SKY IN A NIGHT
MISSUS SEDLEY TOOK HER HUSBAND TO TASK FOR HIS CRUEL CONDUCT TO POOR JOE IT WAS QUITE WICKED OF YOU MISTER SEDLEY SAID SHE TO TORMENT THE POOR BOY SO MY DEAR SAID THE COTTON TASSEL IN DEFENCE OF HIS CONDUCT
BONEY HIMSELF HASN'T GOT SUCH IN HIS CELLAR MY BOY A GOBLET OF CHAMPAGNE RESTORED JOSEPH'S EQUANIMITY AND BEFORE THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTIED OF WHICH AS AN INVALID HE TOOK TWO THIRDS HE HAD AGREED TO TAKE THE YOUNG LADIES TO VAUXHALL
THE DAWN IS UP THE GUEST IS GONE THE COTTAGE HEARTH IS BLAZING STILL HEAVEN PITY ALL POOR WANDERERS LONE HARK TO THE WIND UPON THE HILL IT WAS THE SENTIMENT OF THE BEFORE MENTIONED WORDS WHEN I'M GONE
BUT I'VE NO PATIENCE WITH JOS AND HIS DANDIFIED MODESTY IT IS OUT JOSEPHING JOSEPH MY DEAR AND ALL THE WHILE THE BOY IS ONLY THINKING OF HIMSELF AND WHAT A FINE FELLOW HE IS I DOUBT MA'AM WE SHALL HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH HIM YET
QUITE READY TO KISS HER BROTHER IF HE WERE SO MINDED AND I THINK FOR A KISS FROM SUCH A DEAR CREATURE AS AMELIA I WOULD PURCHASE ALL MISTER LEE'S CONSERVATORIES OUT OF HAND O HEAVENLY HEAVENLY FLOWERS EXCLAIMED MISS SHARP
AH LOUD AND PIERCING WAS THE STORM THE COTTAGE ROOF WAS SHELTER'D SURE
FOR ON THE EVENING APPOINTED FOR THE VAUXHALL PARTY GEORGE OSBORNE HAVING COME TO DINNER AND THE ELDERS OF THE HOUSE HAVING DEPARTED ACCORDING TO INVITATION TO DINE WITH ALDERMAN BALLS AT HIGHBURY BARN THERE CAME ON SUCH A THUNDER STORM AS ONLY HAPPENS ON VAUXHALL NIGHTS
A PROMISE THAT HE JOSEPH WOULD TAKE HER TO VAUXHALL NOW SHE SAID THAT REBECCA IS WITH US WILL BE THE VERY TIME O DELIGHTFUL SAID REBECCA GOING TO CLAP HER HANDS BUT SHE RECOLLECTED HERSELF AND PAUSED LIKE A MODEST CREATURE AS SHE WAS
JOSEPH SEDLEY'S BACHELORHOOD WOULD HAVE BEEN AT AN END AND THIS WORK WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BUT AT THE CLOSE OF THE DITTY REBECCA QUITTED THE PIANO AND GIVING HER HAND TO AMELIA WALKED AWAY INTO THE FRONT DRAWING ROOM TWILIGHT
AT WHICH SPEECH EVEN MISTER SAMBO AT THE SIDEBOARD BURST OUT LAUGHING AND POOR FAT JOE FELT INCLINED TO BECOME A PARRICIDE ALMOST UNDO HIS STAYS CONTINUED THE PITILESS OLD GENTLEMAN
YES AND AFTER I HAD CUT THE TASSELS OF HIS BOOTS TOO BOYS NEVER FORGET THOSE TIPS AT SCHOOL NOR THE GIVERS I DELIGHT IN HESSIAN BOOTS SAID REBECCA JOS SEDLEY WHO ADMIRED HIS OWN LEGS PRODIGIOUSLY
AMELIA HASTENED AFTER HER FRIEND TO KNOW THE CAUSE OF THIS DISPLAY OF FEELING AND THE GOOD NATURED GIRL CAME BACK WITHOUT HER COMPANION RATHER AFFECTED TOO YOU KNOW HER FATHER WAS OUR DRAWING MASTER MAMMA AT CHISWICK AND USED TO DO ALL THE BEST PARTS OF OUR DRAWINGS
SADLY PUTTING OUT AMELIA WHO WAS WRITING TO HER TWELVE DEAREST FRIENDS AT CHISWICK MALL AND REBECCA WAS EMPLOYED UPON HER YESTERDAY'S WORK AS JOE'S BUGGY DROVE UP AND WHILE AFTER HIS USUAL THUNDERING KNOCK AND POMPOUS BUSTLE AT THE DOOR
IT'S A MERCY HE DID NOT BRING US OVER A BLACK DAUGHTER IN LAW MY DEAR BUT MARK MY WORDS THE FIRST WOMAN WHO FISHES FOR HIM HOOKS HIM SHE SHALL GO OFF TO MORROW THE LITTLE ARTFUL CREATURE SAID MISSUS SEDLEY WITH GREAT ENERGY
AS THE FRONTISPIECES HAVE IN THE MEDULLA AND THE SPELLING BOOK I SHAN'T HAVE TIME TO DO IT HERE SAID REBECCA I'LL DO IT WHEN WHEN I'M GONE AND SHE DROPPED HER VOICE AND LOOKED SO SAD AND PITEOUS
WHEN THE PARENTS OF THE HOUSE OF SEDLEY RETURNED FROM THEIR DINNER PARTY THEY FOUND THE YOUNG PEOPLE SO BUSY IN TALKING THAT THEY HAD NOT HEARD THE ARRIVAL OF THE CARRIAGE AND MISTER JOSEPH WAS IN THE ACT OF SAYING
MY LOVE I'M SURE I ALWAYS HEARD MISS PINKERTON SAY THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH THEM HE ONLY MOUNTED THEM IT WAS CALLED MOUNTING MAMMA REBECCA REMEMBERS THE DRAWING AND HER FATHER WORKING AT IT AND THE THOUGHT OF IT CAME UPON HER RATHER SUDDENLY AND
NOTHING COULD INDUCE HER FRIEND TO GO WITHOUT HER WHAT YOU WHO HAVE SHOWN THE POOR ORPHAN WHAT HAPPINESS AND LOVE ARE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE QUIT YOU NEVER AND THE GREEN EYES LOOKED UP TO HEAVEN AND FILLED WITH TEARS
THOSE TWO HAVE TOLD THEIRS AS SOON AS HE GETS HIS COMPANY SAID JOSEPH I BELIEVE THE AFFAIR IS SETTLED GEORGE OSBORNE IS A CAPITAL FELLOW AND YOUR SISTER THE DEAREST CREATURE IN THE WORLD SAID REBECCA
THE HOUSE WAS AN OLD ONE FACING THE BOARD OF TRADE AND THE INSCRIPTION ON THE ANCIENT DOOR TOLD PASSERS BY THAT THIS WAS THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SPECIAL BRANCH THE DUTIES OF T X WERE MULTIFARIOUS
BUT I REMEMBER THE MACEDONIAN SHOOTING CASE IN SOUTH LONDON
HE IS VERY RICH HAS NO RELATIONS AND HAS A PASSION FOR POWER THEN HE'LL BE HUNG SAID THE CHIEF RISING I DOUBT IT SAID THE OTHER PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF MONEY SELDOM GET HUNG YOU ONLY GET HUNG FOR WANTING MONEY
CAMPANY LIFTED HIS QUILL PEN AND POINTED TO A CASE OF BIG LEATHER BOUND VOLUMES IN A FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM THIRD SHELF FROM THE BOTTOM DOCTOR HE REPLIED YOU'LL SEE TWO BOOKS THERE ONE'S THE REGISTER OF ALL BURIALS WITHIN THE CATHEDRAL ITSELF UP TO DATE
ALTOGETHER IT WAS MORE THAN MERE CURIOSITY THAT WAS INDICATED ON HIS FEATURES AND BRYCE SATISFIED AND SECRETLY ELATED TURNED TO HEAR WHAT MISTER ALEXANDER CHILSTONE HAD TO TELL
ALL THE SAME RETORTED CAMPANY I SHOULD MAKE INQUIRY AT BARTHORPE YOU'VE GOT TO GO ON PROBABILITIES THE PROBABILITIES IN THIS CASE ARE THAT THE MAN WAS INTERESTED IN THE BOOK BECAUSE IT DEALT WITH HIS OWN TOWN
THE ROOM IN WHICH HE LIVES IS PRACTICALLY A SAFE SIR GEORGE RAISED HIS EYEBROWS A SAFE HE REPEATED
TO DREAM OF CATS MEANS ENEMIES
IF BY CHANCE YOU LOST THE KEYS OF YOUR SAFE
THAT THE THEORY WHICH ARCHDALE HAD PUT FORWARD AT THE CLUB IN BRYCE'S HEARING THE PREVIOUS DAY HAD GAINED FAVOUR WITH THE AUTHORITIES AND THAT THE VISIT OF THE JURYMEN TO THE SCENE OF THE DISASTER HAD BEEN INTENDED BY THE CORONER TO PREDISPOSE THEM IN BEHALF OF IT
AGAINST EACH NAME WAS A NUMBER CORRESPONDING WITH THE SAME NUMBER MARKED ON THE VARIOUS DIVISIONS OF THE CHART
AFTER HIM CAME THE MASTER MASON EXPRESSING THE SAME DECIDED CONVICTION THAT THE REAL TRUTH WAS THAT THE PAVEMENT OF THE GALLERY HAD AT THAT PARTICULAR PLACE BECOME SO SMOOTH AND WAS INCLINED TOWARDS THE OPEN DOORWAY AT SUCH A SHARP ANGLE
AND TURNED TO THE WALL ON WHICH THE CHARTS AND MAPS WERE HUNG THERE WAS ONE THERE OF PARADISE WHEREON WAS MARKED THE SITE AND NAMES OF ALL THE TOMBS AND GRAVES IN THAT ANCIENT ENCLOSURE
AND HE HAD HAD THE DISTINCTION OF HAVING PROVOKED BY CERTAIN CORRESPONDENCE WHICH HAD SEEN THE LIGHT THE COMMENT OF A FORMER HOME SECRETARY THAT IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT MISTER MEREDITH DID NOT TAKE HIS POSITION WITH THE SERIOUSNESS WHICH WAS EXPECTED FROM A PUBLIC OFFICIAL
IT WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR HIS REFERENCES FROM OUR AGENTS IN AUSTRALIA WERE QUITE SATISFACTORY BUT HE DID MENTION THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT THERE FOR SOME YEARS AND HAD SPECULATED IN LANDED PROPERTY HE ALSO SAID THAT HE WAS NOW GOING TO SETTLE IN ENGLAND FOR GOOD
THAT CONCLUDED MISTER CHILSTONE IS ALL I CAN TELL OF MY OWN KNOWLEDGE BUT HE ADDED DRAWING A NEWSPAPER FROM HIS POCKET HERE IS AN ADVERTISEMENT WHICH I NOTICED IN THIS MORNING'S TIMES AS I CAME DOWN YOU WILL OBSERVE HE SAID AS HE PASSED IT TO THE CORONER
BUT HERE BRYCE MET HIS FIRST CHECK DOWN EACH SIDE OF THE OLD CHART DATED EIGHTEEN FIFTY THERE WAS A TABULATED LIST OF THE TOMBS IN PARADISE THE NAMES OF FAMILIES AND PERSONS WERE GIVEN IN THIS LIST
MANSUS HAS DONE HIS BEST THE OTHER WENT ON EASILY
OH I DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED CARELESSLY I DON'T SEE THAT THAT FOLLOWS I SAW THE BOOK A CURIOUS OLD BINDING AND QUEER OLD COPPER PLATES THE MAN MAY HAVE PICKED IT UP FOR THAT REASON I'VE BOUGHT OLD BOOKS MYSELF FOR LESS
AND BRYCE TURNED AGAIN TO CORONER AND WITNESS BUT THE WITNESS HAD NO MORE TO SAY EXCEPT TO SUGGEST THAT THE BANK'S MELBOURNE AGENTS SHOULD BE CABLED TO FOR INFORMATION SINCE IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT MUCH MORE COULD BE GOT IN ENGLAND
THE OTHER'S THE REGISTER OF THOSE IN PARADISE AND THE CLOISTERS WHAT NAMES ARE YOU WANTING TO TRACE BUT BRYCE AFFECTED NOT TO HEAR THE LAST QUESTION HE WALKED OVER TO THE PLACE WHICH CAMPANY HAD INDICATED
IN APPEARANCE T X CONVEYED THE IMPRESSION OF EXTREME YOUTH FOR HIS FACE WAS ALMOST BOYISH AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN YOU LOOKED AT HIM CLOSELY AND SAW THE LITTLE CREASES ABOUT HIS EYES THE SETTING OF HIS STRAIGHT MOUTH THAT YOU GUESSED HE WAS ON THE WAY TO FORTY
ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF POLICE T X MEREDITH DID NOT OCCUPY OFFICES IN NEW SCOTLAND YARD IT IS THE PECULIARITY OF PUBLIC OFFICES THAT THEY ARE PLANNED WITH THE IDEA OF SUPPLYING THE MARGIN OF SPACE ABOVE ALL REQUIREMENTS
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SORROWFULLY AT THE SMILING MANSUS WHO HAD BEEN IN THE POLICE FORCE WHEN T X WAS A SMALL BOY AT SCHOOL YOU ARE NEITHER WISE NOR WILY YOU COMBINE THE INNOCENCE OF A BABY WITH THE GRUBBINESS OF A COUNTY PARSON YOU OUGHT TO BE IN THE CHOIR
JOURNEYING FROM LONDON TO WRYCHESTER MISSUS PARTINGLEY TOLD HOW HE HAD ARRIVED AT THE MITRE REGISTERED IN HER BOOK AS MISTER JOHN BRADEN AND HAD NEXT MORNING ASKED IF HE COULD GET A CONVEYANCE FOR SAXONSTEADE IN THE AFTERNOON AS HE WISHED TO SEE THE DUKE
BUT T X PROTESTED THE INSPECTOR THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE FOUND IT WAS THE OUTRAGEOUS PRACTICE OF MISTER MEREDITH TO INSIST UPON HIS ASSOCIATES CALLING HIM BY HIS INITIALS A PRACTICE WHICH HAD EARNT DISAPPROVAL IN THE HIGHEST QUARTERS
WHO FOR ANYTHING THAT MISSUS PARTINGLEY OR ANYBODY ELSE COULD SAY TO THE CONTRARY MIGHT HAVE HAD AN APPOINTMENT AND BUSINESS WITH HIM BUT HIS GRACE KNEW NOTHING
IN CONSEQUENCE OF FINDING THE BOOK ABOUT BARTHORPE IN THE SUIT CASE SAID MITCHINGTON WE SENT A LONG TELEGRAM YESTERDAY TO THE POLICE THERE TELLING THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED
WHO CONDUCTED TO THE CORONER A MIDDLE AGED WELL DRESSED MAN WHOM BRYCE AT ONCE SET DOWN AS A LONDON COMMERCIAL MAGNATE OF SOME QUALITY BETWEEN THE NEW ARRIVAL AND THE CORONER AN INTERCHANGE OF REMARKS WAS AT ONCE MADE
A POLICEMAN EXCLAIMED THE EXASPERATED T X YOU'RE WORSE THAN A PIE YOU'RE A SLUD
SHARED IN PRESENTLY BY SOME OF THE OFFICIALS AT THE TABLE AND WHEN THE JURY CAME BACK THE STRANGER WAS AT ONCE USHERED INTO THE WITNESS BOX AND THE CORONER TURNED TO THE JURY AND THE COURT
OUR COLLECTION IS A BIT FAMOUS YOU KNOW PERHAPS HE WAS A BOOKMAN WE HAVE SOME RARE EDITIONS
AND WHO BROUGHT TO BOOK SIR JULIUS WAGLITE THOUGH HE HAD COVERED HIS TRAIL OF DEFALCATION THROUGH THE BALANCE SHEETS OF THIRTY FOUR COMPANIES
NOTHING WHATEVER IS KNOWN AT BARTHORPE WHICH IS A VERY SMALL TOWN OF ANY PERSON OF THAT NAME SO MUCH FOR THAT THOUGHT BRYCE HE TURNED WITH MORE INTEREST TO THE NEXT WITNESS THE DUKE OF SAXONSTEADE THE GREAT LOCAL MAGNATE
BEGAN THE CHIEF FUNNY BUSINESS INTERRUPTED T X NOT A BIT HOUSE AND MAN ARE QUITE NORMAL SAVE FOR THESE ECCENTRICITIES HE HAS ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF SPENDING THREE MONTHS OF THE YEAR IN ENGLAND AND NINE MONTHS ABROAD
ANY MORE HE ASKED LET ME THINK SAID T X LOOKING UP AT THE CEILING
IT MAY BE SOMETHING INTERESTING A LITTLE PAUSE THEN A HOARSE VOICE SPOKE TO HIM IS THAT YOU T X THAT'S ME SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER COMMONLY IT'S JOHN LEXMAN SPEAKING
WHO HAS NO PARTICULAR POSITION IN LONDON SOCIETY AND THEREFORE HAS NO REASON FOR COMING HERE WHO OPENLY EXPRESSES HIS DETESTATION OF THE CLIMATE WHO HAS A MAGNIFICENT ESTATE IN SOME WILD PLACE IN THE BALKANS WHO IS AN EXCELLENT HORSEMAN A MAGNIFICENT SHOT AND A PASSABLE AVIATOR
SAYING THAT HE WOULD CALL FOR IT LATER HE DID NOT GIVE US ANY ADDRESS IN LONDON NOR IN ENGLAND CONTINUED THE WITNESS HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD ONLY ARRIVED AT CHARING CROSS THAT VERY MORNING HAVING TRAVELLED FROM PARIS DURING THE NIGHT
HE SAID THAT HE SHOULD SETTLE DOWN FOR A TIME AT SOME RESIDENTIAL HOTEL IN LONDON AND IN THE MEANTIME HE HAD ONE OR TWO CALLS OR VISITS TO MAKE IN THE COUNTRY WHEN HE RETURNED FROM THEM HE SAID HE WOULD CALL ON ME AGAIN HE GAVE ME VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT HIMSELF
I'VE BEEN FED ON IT MAN AND BOY FOR FIVE AND FORTY YEARS BRYCE MADE SOME FITTING REMARK AND WENT OUT AND HOME TO HIS ROOMS THERE TO SPEND MOST OF THE ENSUING EVENING IN TRYING TO PUZZLE OUT THE VARIOUS MYSTERIES OF THE DAY
AND IF I MAY SAY SO RIGHTLY BUT I DON'T REMEMBER THIS MAN AT ALL IN FACT I'D GO AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT I'M POSITIVE I'VE NEVER KNOWINGLY SET EYES ON HIM IN MY LIFE
AND NOW ARCHDALE HIMSELF AS REPRESENTING THE ARCHITECTS WHO HELD A RETAINING FEE IN CONNECTION WITH THE CATHEDRAL WAS CALLED TO GIVE HIS OPINION
HE TURNED AWAY AT LAST FROM THE CHART AT A LOSS AND CAMPANY GLANCED AT HIM FOUND WHAT YOU WANTED HE ASKED OH YES REPLIED BRYCE PRIMED WITH A READY ANSWER I JUST WANTED TO SEE WHERE THE SPELBANKS WERE BURIED QUITE A LOT OF THEM I SEE
NONE BUT THEN REPLIED THE DUKE THERE MIGHT BE MANY REASONS UNKNOWN TO ME BUT AT WHICH I CAN MAKE A GUESS IF HE WAS AN ANTIQUARY THERE ARE LOTS OF OLD THINGS AT SAXONSTEADE WHICH HE MIGHT WISH TO SEE OR HE MIGHT BE A LOVER OF PICTURES
AND WANTS TO KNOW IF HE CAN HAVE A PRIVATE TELEPHONE CONNECTION BETWEEN HIS HOUSE AND THE CENTRAL OFFICE WE TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD ALWAYS GET THE NEAREST POLICE STATION ON THE PHONE BUT THAT DOESN'T SATISFY HIM HE HAS MADE BAD FRIENDS WITH SOME GENTLEMAN OF HIS OWN COUNTRY WHO SOONER OR LATER HE THINKS WILL CUT HIS THROAT
SOUTHEAST CORNER OF PARADISE SAID CAMPANY SEVERAL TOMBS I COULD HAVE SPARED YOU THE TROUBLE OF LOOKING YOU'RE A REGULAR ENCYCLOPAEDIA ABOUT THE PLACE LAUGHED BRYCE I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW EVERY SPOUT AND GARGOYLE OUGHT TO ANSWERED THE LIBRARIAN
SIR GEORGE DROPPED HEAVILY INTO THE ARM CHAIR AND STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG THIN LEGS WHAT I WANT HE SAID LOOKING UP AT THE CEILING AND PUTTING HIS HANDS TOGETHER
SIR GEORGE SMILED GRIMLY I HAVE THE INTEREST WHICH IS THE INTEREST OF MY DEPARTMENT HE SAID THAT IS TO SAY I WANT TO KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ABNORMAL PEOPLE WE HAVE HAD AN APPLICATION FROM HIM HE WENT ON WHICH IS RATHER UNUSUAL
ALL THIS I KNOW HE SAID PATIENTLY IF YOU WILL FURTHER UNFOLD THE SECRET DOSSIER SIR GEORGE I AM PREPARED TO BE THRILLED
HE TURNED FROM T X TO THE DISCOMFORTED INSPECTOR VERY LITTLE SAID T X I'VE HAD MANSUS ON THE JOB
THEN YOU'RE IN SOME DANGER T X SMILED THE CHIEF FOR ACCORDING TO MY ACCOUNT YOU'RE ALWAYS MORE OR LESS BROKE A GENIAL LIBEL SAID T X BUT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE BEING BROKE I SAW JOHN LEXMAN TO DAY YOU KNOW HIM THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER NODDED
MISTER FOLLIOT TESTIFIED TO HAVING SEEN HIM IN THE CATHEDRAL GOING TOWARDS ONE OF THE STAIRWAYS LEADING TO THE GALLERY VARNER MOST IMPORTANT WITNESS OF ALL UP TO THAT POINT TOLD OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN
BEYOND THE TABLE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM HE SAW AT ONCE THAT RANSFORD HOWEVER STRENUOUSLY HE MIGHT BE FIGHTING TO KEEP HIS FACE UNDER CONTROL
PEOPLE SAID OF HIM AND LIKE MOST PUBLIC GOSSIP THIS WAS PROBABLY UNTRUE
THE CHIEF OF THE POLICE IN THESE DAYS WAS A GREY MAN RATHER TIRED WITH A HAWK NOSE AND DEEP EYES THAT GLARED UNDER SHAGGY EYEBROWS
COULD NOT THINK OF ANY REASON AT ALL WHY THIS MISTER JOHN BRADEN SHOULD WISH TO SEE HIM
NOTHING IS TO BE FOUND HE REPEATED WRATHFULLY
HE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE MIGHT TELL IF HE TOLD ALL THE TRUTH HE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE MIGHT GET OUT OF RANSFORD IF HE BRYCE WERE CORONER OR SOLICITOR AND HAD RANSFORD IN THAT WITNESS BOX HE WOULD ASK HIM ON HIS OATH IF HE KNEW THAT DEAD MAN
MISTER CHILSTONE SAW PARTICULARS OF THIS MATTER IN THE NEWSPAPERS THIS MORNING AND HE AT ONCE SET OFF TO WRYCHESTER TO TELL US WHAT HE KNOWS OF THE DEAD MAN WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO MISTER CHILSTONE
HE GOT NO MORE LIGHT ON THEM THEN AND HE WAS STILL EXERCISING HIS BRAINS ON THEM WHEN HE WENT TO THE INQUEST NEXT MORNING TO FIND THE CORONER'S COURT PACKED TO THE DOORS WITH AN ASSEMBLAGE OF TOWNSFOLK JUST AS CURIOUS AS HE WAS
THE ACCOUNT BEING OPENED HE PAID INTO IT A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS IN A DRAFT AT SIGHT DRAWN BY ONE OF THOSE AGENTS HE DREW NOTHING AGAINST THIS REMARKING CASUALLY THAT HE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY IN HIS POCKET FOR THE PRESENT HE DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE CHEQUE BOOK WHICH WAS OFFERED HIM
THE FACT IS YOUR GRACE DOESN'T KNOW HIM AND KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT HIM OBSERVED THE CORONER
OBVIOUSLY IF THE TOMB OF RICHARD JENKINS WHO WAS BURIED IN PARADISE IN SEVENTEEN FIFTEEN
BRYCE TURNED AWAY TOWARDS A WALL ON WHICH HUNG A NUMBER OF CHARTS AND PLANS OF WRYCHESTER CATHEDRAL AND ITS PRECINCTS IT WAS TO INSPECT ONE OF THESE THAT HE HAD COME TO THE LIBRARY
AND ILLUSTRATING HIS INSTRUCTION OR HIS ADMONITION WITH THE QUAINTEST PHRASEOLOGY NOW HE WAS TILTED BACK IN HIS OFFICE CHAIR AT AN ALARMING ANGLE SCOWLING AT HIS DISTRESSED SUBORDINATE WHO SAT ON THE EDGE OF A CHAIR AT THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS DESK
A TELEPHONE BELL IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM RANG SHARPLY AND T X PICKED UP THE RECEIVER HE LISTENED INTENTLY
WAS HE MISTAKEN IN BELIEVING THAT HE SAW HIM START

THIS MORNING THE MAN ON DUTY REPORTED TO ME THAT A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT HE WAS RESTLESS AND KEPT SAYING HIS PRAYERS SOMEWHAT LOUDLY I ASKED HIM IF THAT WAS ALL HE REPLIED THAT IT WAS ALL HE HEARD
HE WAS SULKY AND SO I CAME AWAY LATER IN THE DAY HE SENT FOR ME ORDINARILY I WOULD NOT HAVE COME WITHOUT SPECIAL REASON BUT JUST AT PRESENT I AM SO INTERESTED IN HIM THAT I WOULD GLADLY MAKE AN EFFORT
THE WHOLE NINE I ASKED
I THINK THAT THROUGH THE CLOUDINESS OF HIS INSANITY HE SAW SOME ANTAGONISM IN ME FOR HE AT ONCE FELL BACK ON THE LAST REFUGE OF SUCH AS HE A DOGGED SILENCE
AS IT WOULD PERHAPS HAVE GIVEN SOME CLUE TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE HOUSE I REMEMBERED MY EXPERIENCE OF THE INVESTIGATION AND PURCHASE OF CARFAX
FOR AN INSTANT HE UNCONSCIOUSLY RELAPSED INTO HIS OLD SERVILE MANNER BENT LOW BEFORE ME AND ACTUALLY FAWNED UPON ME AS HE REPLIED I DON'T WANT ANY SOULS INDEED INDEED I DON'T I COULDN'T USE THEM IF I HAD THEM THEY WOULD BE NO MANNER OF USE TO ME
THE FIRST STEP WAS TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE SO I ASKED HIM SPEAKING PRETTY LOUD SO THAT HE WOULD HEAR ME THROUGH HIS CLOSED EARS
IF WE COULD ONLY GET SOME HINT AS TO WHAT PASSED IN HIS MIND BETWEEN THE TIME OF MY ARGUMENT WITH HIM TO DAY AND HIS RESUMPTION OF FLY CATCHING IT MIGHT AFFORD US A VALUABLE CLUE HE IS NOW SEEMINGLY QUIET FOR A SPELL IS HE
OR SOMETHINK OF THE KIND NOT LONG BUILT IT WAS A DUSTY OLD OUSE TOO THOUGH NOTHIN TO THE DUSTINESS OF THE OUSE WE TOOKED THE BLOOMIN BOXES FROM
HE DOES NOT WISH TO BE DISTURBED IN THE WORK WITHOUT CAUSE I WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM WITH ME TO SEE THE PATIENT ONLY I THOUGHT THAT AFTER HIS LAST REPULSE HE MIGHT NOT CARE TO GO AGAIN THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER REASON
THE MEWS WERE ACTIVE THE PICCADILLY HOUSES BEING MOSTLY IN OCCUPATION I ASKED ONE OR TWO OF THE GROOMS AND HELPERS WHOM I SAW AROUND IF THEY COULD TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT THE EMPTY HOUSE ONE OF THEM SAID THAT HE HEARD IT HAD LATELY BEEN TAKEN
THANK GOD THIS WILL BE THE LAST NIGHT OF HER LOOKING ON AT OUR CONFERENCES AND FEELING THE STING OF OUR NOT SHOWING OUR CONFIDENCE IT TOOK ALL MY COURAGE TO HOLD TO THE WISE RESOLUTION OF KEEPING HER OUT OF OUR GRIM TASK
THE ORIGINAL VENDORS ARE THE EXECUTORS OF THE LATE MISTER ARCHIBALD WINTER SUFFIELD THE PURCHASER IS A FOREIGN NOBLEMAN COUNT DE VILLE WHO EFFECTED THE PURCHASE HIMSELF PAYING THE PURCHASE MONEY IN NOTES OVER THE COUNTER
BUT UNCOMMUNICATIVE IN EQUAL PROPORTION HAVING ONCE TOLD ME THAT THE PICCADILLY HOUSE WHICH THROUGHOUT OUR INTERVIEW HE CALLED A MANSION WAS SOLD HE CONSIDERED MY BUSINESS AS CONCLUDED WHEN I ASKED WHO HAD PURCHASED IT
THOUGH I FELT THAT BY SO DOING I WAS LOWERING MYSELF IN THE EYES OF THE LUNATIC AND WHY WITH ENOCH BECAUSE HE WALKED WITH GOD I COULD NOT SEE THE ANALOGY BUT DID NOT LIKE TO ADMIT IT
I WONDER I SAID REFLECTIVELY WHAT AN ELEPHANT'S SOUL IS LIKE THE EFFECT I DESIRED WAS OBTAINED FOR HE AT ONCE FELL FROM HIS HIGH HORSE AND BECAME A CHILD AGAIN I DON'T WANT AN ELEPHANT'S SOUL OR ANY SOUL AT ALL HE SAID
IT WAS EVIDENT THEN THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT UNCONSCIOUS CEREBRATION WAS DOING ITS WORK EVEN WITH THE LUNATIC I DETERMINED TO HAVE THE MATTER OUT WHAT ABOUT THEM YOURSELF I ASKED
WITH A LAUGH HE REPLIED NOT MUCH FLIES ARE POOR THINGS AFTER ALL AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED BUT I DON'T WANT THEIR SOULS BUZZING ROUND ME ALL THE SAME OR SPIDERS I WENT ON BLOW SPIDERS WHAT'S THE USE OF SPIDERS
LIFE IS ALL RIGHT I HAVE ALL I WANT YOU MUST GET A NEW PATIENT DOCTOR
DESPISES THE MEANER FORMS OF LIFE ALTOGETHER THOUGH HE DREADS BEING HAUNTED BY THEIR SOULS LOGICALLY ALL THESE THINGS POINT ONE WAY HE HAS ASSURANCE OF SOME KIND THAT HE WILL ACQUIRE SOME HIGHER LIFE
WHO HAD SLEPT OFF THE REMAINS OF HIS BEER ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AT CORCORAN'S HAD LEFT FOR HIS WORK AT POPLAR AT FIVE O'CLOCK THAT MORNING HE COULD NOT TELL ME WHERE THE PLACE OF WORK WAS SITUATED BUT HE HAD A VAGUE IDEA THAT IT WAS SOME KIND OF A NEW FANGLED WARE'US
IF ONE COULD ONLY GET THEM IN PROPER ORDER HERE THEY ARE WILL NOT MENTION DRINKING FEARS THE THOUGHT OF BEING BURDENED WITH THE SOUL OF ANYTHING HAS NO DREAD OF WANTING LIFE IN THE FUTURE
KORKRANS FOUR POTERS CORT BARTEL STREET WALWORTH ARSK FOR THE DEPITE I GOT THE LETTER IN BED AND ROSE WITHOUT WAKING MINA SHE LOOKED HEAVY AND SLEEPY AND PALE AND FAR FROM WELL
I NEVER EARD OF IM IN ALL MY BLOOMIN DAYS DON'T BELIEVE THERE AIN'T NOBODY OF THAT KIND LIVIN ERE OR ANYWHERES I TOOK OUT SMOLLET'S LETTER AND AS I READ IT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE LESSON OF THE SPELLING OF THE NAME OF THE COURT MIGHT GUIDE ME WHAT ARE YOU
HE GAVE ME THE DESTINATIONS OF THE BOXES
FAR BE IT FROM ME TO ARROGATE TO MYSELF THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE DEITY I AM NOT EVEN CONCERNED IN HIS ESPECIALLY SPIRITUAL DOINGS IF I MAY STATE MY INTELLECTUAL POSITION I AM SO FAR AS CONCERNS THINGS PURELY TERRESTRIAL
HE WAS IN THE CLOUDS AND LOOKED DOWN ON ALL THE WEAKNESSES AND WANTS OF US POOR MORTALS I THOUGHT I WOULD IMPROVE THE OCCASION AND LEARN SOMETHING SO I ASKED HIM WHAT ABOUT THE FLIES THESE TIMES
AND ANOTHER SIX WHICH HE DEPOSITED AT JAMAICA LANE BERMONDSEY IF THEN THE COUNT MEANT TO SCATTER THESE GHASTLY REFUGES OF HIS OVER LONDON THESE PLACES WERE CHOSEN AS THE FIRST OF DELIVERY
THE VERY PROSPECT OF BEER WHICH MY EXPECTED COMING HAD OPENED TO HIM HAD PROVED TOO MUCH
AFTER DINNER WHEN WE HAD ALL GATHERED ROUND THE FIRE IN THE STUDY MISSUS HARKER HAVING GONE TO BED WE DISCUSSED THE ATTEMPTS AND DISCOVERIES OF THE DAY HARKER WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD ANY RESULT
RENFIELD SEEMED HIMSELF AWARE OF HAVING MADE A LAPSE FOR HE HURRIED ON AS THOUGH TO DISTRACT MY ATTENTION FROM IT I DON'T TAKE ANY STOCK AT ALL IN SUCH MATTERS RATS AND MICE AND SUCH SMALL DEER AS SHAKESPEARE HAS IT
I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF BRINGING THIS DIARY RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT I AM VERY SLEEPY AND SHALL GO TO BED JUST A LINE MINA SLEEPS SOUNDLY AND HER BREATHING IS REGULAR HER FOREHEAD IS PUCKERED UP INTO LITTLE WRINKLES
WHEN SHE CAME BACK I ADDRESSED THE ENVELOPE AND STAMPED IT AND WHEN SMOLLET HAD AGAIN FAITHFULLY PROMISED TO POST THE ADDRESS WHEN FOUND I TOOK MY WAY TO HOME WE'RE ON THE TRACK ANYHOW I AM TIRED TO NIGHT
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNDERGOING SOME PROCESS OF MENTAL DISTURBANCE AND KNOWING HOW HIS PAST MOODS HAD INTERPRETED THINGS SEEMINGLY FOREIGN TO HIMSELF I THOUGHT I WOULD ENTER INTO HIS MIND AS WELL AS I COULD AND GO WITH HIM
THAT WILD YELL SEEMED TO COME FROM HIS ROOM THE ATTENDANT CAME BURSTING INTO MY ROOM AND TOLD ME THAT RENFIELD HAD SOMEHOW MET WITH SOME ACCIDENT HE HAD HEARD HIM YELL AND WHEN HE WENT TO HIM FOUND HIM LYING ON HIS FACE ON THE FLOOR ALL COVERED WITH BLOOD
I THOUGHT I WOULD PUSH HIS ANALOGY TO ITS UTMOST LOGICALLY SO I SAID QUICKLY OH IT IS A SOUL YOU ARE AFTER NOW IS IT HIS MADNESS FOILED HIS REASON AND A PUZZLED LOOK SPREAD OVER HIS FACE AS
IN THIS INSTANCE I AM NOT PROMPTED BY CURIOSITY I ACT ON THE PART OF LORD GODALMING WHO WISHES TO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE PROPERTY WHICH WAS HE UNDERSTOOD LATELY FOR SALE THESE WORDS PUT A DIFFERENT COMPLEXION ON AFFAIRS
BUT I DO MIND HE ANSWERED THE AFFAIRS OF THEIR CLIENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY SAFE IN THE HANDS OF MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY THIS WAS MANIFESTLY A PRIG OF THE FIRST WATER AND THERE WAS NO USE ARGUING WITH HIM
HE SAID I WOULD LIKE TO OBLIGE YOU IF I COULD MISTER HARKER AND ESPECIALLY WOULD I LIKE TO OBLIGE HIS LORDSHIP WE ONCE CARRIED OUT A SMALL MATTER OF RENTING SOME CHAMBERS FOR HIM WHEN HE WAS THE HONOURABLE ARTHUR HOLMWOOD
IF WE FIND THEM ALL IN THAT HOUSE THEN OUR WORK IS NEAR THE END BUT IF THERE BE SOME MISSING WE MUST SEARCH UNTIL WE FIND THEM THEN SHALL WE MAKE OUR FINAL COUP AND HUNT THE WRETCH TO HIS REAL DEATH
I SEE I SAID YOU WANT BIG THINGS THAT YOU CAN MAKE YOUR TEETH MEET IN HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BREAKFAST ON ELEPHANT WHAT RIDICULOUS NONSENSE YOU ARE TALKING HE WAS GETTING TOO WIDE AWAKE SO I THOUGHT I WOULD PRESS HIM HARD
A POSE WHICH IS GENERALLY INDICATIVE OF SOME MENTAL ENERGY ON HIS PART WHEN I CAME IN HE SAID AT ONCE AS THOUGH THE QUESTION HAD BEEN WAITING ON HIS LIPS WHAT ABOUT SOULS
AS HE ANSWERED ME THE FLY MY DEAR SIR HAS ONE STRIKING FEATURE ITS WINGS ARE TYPICAL OF THE AERIAL POWERS OF THE PSYCHIC FACULTIES THE ANCIENTS DID WELL WHEN THEY TYPIFIED THE SOUL AS A BUTTERFLY
SHE SEEMS SOMEHOW MORE RECONCILED OR ELSE THE VERY SUBJECT SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME REPUGNANT TO HER FOR WHEN ANY ACCIDENTAL ALLUSION IS MADE SHE ACTUALLY SHUDDERS I AM GLAD WE MADE OUR RESOLUTION IN TIME
HE DREADS THE CONSEQUENCE THE BURDEN OF A SOUL THEN IT IS A HUMAN LIFE HE LOOKS TO AND THE ASSURANCE MERCIFUL GOD THE COUNT HAS BEEN TO HIM AND THERE IS SOME NEW SCHEME OF TERROR AFOOT
OH BUT I AM SLEEPY DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY
THAN IN BEING HERE AMONGST US AND IN IGNORANCE I ONLY SAW DOCTOR SEWARD FOR A MOMENT AND TOLD HIM WHERE I WAS OFF TO PROMISING TO COME BACK AND TELL THE REST SO SOON AS I SHOULD HAVE FOUND OUT ANYTHING
AS THOUGH SHE THINKS EVEN IN HER SLEEP SHE IS STILL TOO PALE BUT DOES NOT LOOK SO HAGGARD AS SHE DID THIS MORNING TO MORROW WILL I HOPE MEND ALL THIS SHE WILL BE HERSELF AT HOME IN EXETER
I PLACED A MAN IN THE CORRIDOR LAST NIGHT AND TOLD HIM TO MAKE AN ACCURATE NOTE OF ANY SOUND HE MIGHT HEAR FROM RENFIELD'S ROOM AND GAVE HIM INSTRUCTIONS THAT IF THERE SHOULD BE ANYTHING STRANGE HE WAS TO CALL ME
HE GREW VERY GRAVE AND AFTER THINKING THE MATTER OVER FOR A WHILE ASKED ME TO TAKE HIM TO RENFIELD I DID SO AS WE CAME TO THE DOOR WE HEARD THE LUNATIC WITHIN SINGING GAILY AS HE USED TO DO IN THE TIME WHICH NOW SEEMS SO LONG AGO
THANK GOD THE CEASING OF TELLING THINGS HAS MADE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US WHEN I CAME DOWN AGAIN I FOUND THE OTHERS ALL GATHERED ROUND THE FIRE IN THE STUDY IN THE TRAIN I HAD WRITTEN MY DIARY SO FAR
FOR SHE HERSELF HAS BECOME RETICENT ON THE SUBJECT AND HAS NOT SPOKEN OF THE COUNT OR HIS DOINGS EVER SINCE WE TOLD HER OF OUR DECISION
MY LORD WE ARE AT ALL TIMES ONLY TOO HAPPY TO MEET YOUR WISHES WE BEG WITH REGARD TO THE DESIRE OF YOUR LORDSHIP EXPRESSED BY MISTER HARKER ON YOUR BEHALF
BUT ANYHOW HE AIN'T LIKE TO BE IN A WAY TO TELL YE MUCH TO NIGHT SAM IS A RARE ONE WHEN HE STARTS ON THE BOOZE IF YOU CAN GIVE ME A ENVELOPE WITH A STAMP ON IT
I DROVE TO WALWORTH AND FOUND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY POTTER'S COURT MISTER SMOLLET'S SPELLING MISLED ME AS I ASKED FOR POTER'S COURT INSTEAD OF POTTER'S COURT HOWEVER
VEGETABLES AND BREAD WHEN THEY INDULGED IN SUCH LUXURIES AND EVEN FRESH WATER WAS TO BE PROCURED FROM THE MAINLAND WHICH WAS ABOUT FIVE MILES DISTANT ON THE WHOLE ISLAND THERE WERE BUT THREE MISERABLE HUTS
AS WE ENTERED THIS CITY OUR MINDS WERE FILLED WITH THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE EVENTS THAT HAD BEEN TRANSACTED THERE MORE THAN A CENTURY AND A HALF BEFORE
NAY A WISH THAT SUCH SHOULD PROVE THE FACT STOLE ACROSS ME I DESIRED THAT I MIGHT PASS MY LIFE ON THAT BARREN ROCK WEARILY IT IS TRUE
THE LAKES AND THE DASHING OF THE ROCKY STREAMS WERE ALL FAMILIAR AND DEAR SIGHTS TO ME HERE ALSO WE MADE SOME ACQUAINTANCES WHO ALMOST CONTRIVED TO CHEAT ME INTO HAPPINESS
THE DELIGHT OF CLERVAL WAS PROPORTIONABLY GREATER THAN MINE HIS MIND EXPANDED IN THE COMPANY OF MEN OF TALENT AND HE FOUND IN HIS OWN NATURE GREATER CAPACITIES AND RESOURCES
AS IT WAS I LIVED UNGAZED AT AND UNMOLESTED HARDLY THANKED FOR THE PITTANCE OF FOOD AND CLOTHES WHICH I GAVE SO MUCH DOES SUFFERING BLUNT EVEN THE COARSEST SENSATIONS OF MEN IN THIS RETREAT I DEVOTED THE MORNING TO LABOUR
EVERY MOMENT I FEARED TO MEET MY PERSECUTOR SOMETIMES I SAT WITH MY EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND FEARING TO RAISE THEM LEST THEY SHOULD ENCOUNTER THE OBJECT WHICH I SO MUCH DREADED TO BEHOLD
BUT I PRESENTLY RECOVERED MYSELF I WAS INNOCENT THAT COULD EASILY BE PROVED ACCORDINGLY I FOLLOWED MY CONDUCTOR IN SILENCE AND WAS LED TO ONE OF THE BEST HOUSES IN THE TOWN
BUT AS HIS JOURNEY TO LONDON MIGHT BE FOLLOWED EVEN SOONER THAN HE NOW CONJECTURED BY HIS LONGER VOYAGE HE ENTREATED ME TO BESTOW AS MUCH OF MY SOCIETY ON HIM AS I COULD SPARE HE BESOUGHT ME THEREFORE
THAT EVEN NOW WHEN THE SCENE IS ON THE POINT OF CLOSING BEFORE ME FOREVER I SHUDDER TO REFLECT ON IT SOME HOURS PASSED THUS BUT BY DEGREES AS THE SUN DECLINED TOWARDS THE HORIZON
MAN YOU MAY HATE BUT BEWARE YOUR HOURS WILL PASS IN DREAD AND MISERY
TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID COME SIR YOU MUST FOLLOW ME TO MISTER KIRWIN'S TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF YOURSELF WHO IS MISTER KIRWIN WHY AM I TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF
THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE HIS COMPANION WITH THIS RESOLUTION I TRAVERSED THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS AND FIXED ON ONE OF THE REMOTEST OF THE ORKNEYS AS THE SCENE OF MY LABOURS IT WAS A PLACE FITTED FOR SUCH A WORK
AND THE SUN ROSE FROM THE OCEAN MY FEELINGS BECAME CALMER IF IT MAY BE CALLED CALMNESS WHEN THE VIOLENCE OF RAGE SINKS INTO THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR
AND WHEN HE BEGINS TO SINK INTO REPOSE HE FINDS HIMSELF OBLIGED TO QUIT THAT ON WHICH HE RESTS IN PLEASURE FOR SOMETHING NEW WHICH AGAIN ENGAGES HIS ATTENTION
AY SIR FREE ENOUGH FOR HONEST FOLKS MISTER KIRWIN IS A MAGISTRATE AND YOU ARE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS FOUND MURDERED HERE LAST NIGHT THIS ANSWER STARTLED ME
WHILE THIS STRANGE DIALOGUE CONTINUED I PERCEIVED THE CROWD RAPIDLY INCREASE THEIR FACES EXPRESSED A MIXTURE OF CURIOSITY AND ANGER WHICH ANNOYED AND IN SOME DEGREE ALARMED ME
HAVING PARTED FROM MY FRIEND I DETERMINED TO VISIT SOME REMOTE SPOT OF SCOTLAND AND FINISH MY WORK IN SOLITUDE I DID NOT DOUBT BUT THAT THE MONSTER FOLLOWED ME AND WOULD DISCOVER HIMSELF TO ME WHEN I SHOULD HAVE FINISHED
THE MONSTER SAW MY DETERMINATION IN MY FACE AND GNASHED HIS TEETH IN THE IMPOTENCE OF ANGER SHALL EACH MAN CRIED HE FIND A WIFE FOR HIS BOSOM
I FEARED TO WANDER FROM THE SIGHT OF MY FELLOW CREATURES LEST WHEN ALONE HE SHOULD COME TO CLAIM HIS COMPANION IN THE MEAN TIME I WORKED ON AND MY LABOUR WAS ALREADY CONSIDERABLY ADVANCED
BUT I DID NOT REFLECT THAT A VOLUNTARY ACT OF MINE COULD AVERT IT I HAD RESOLVED IN MY OWN MIND THAT TO CREATE ANOTHER LIKE THE FIEND I HAD FIRST MADE WOULD BE AN ACT OF THE BASEST AND MOST ATROCIOUS SELFISHNESS
WE HAD SCARCELY VISITED THE VARIOUS LAKES OF CUMBERLAND AND WESTMORLAND AND CONCEIVED AN AFFECTION FOR SOME OF THE INHABITANTS WHEN THE PERIOD OF OUR APPOINTMENT WITH OUR SCOTCH FRIEND APPROACHED AND WE LEFT THEM TO TRAVEL ON FOR MY OWN PART
BUT IN CLERVAL I SAW THE IMAGE OF MY FORMER SELF HE WAS INQUISITIVE AND ANXIOUS TO GAIN EXPERIENCE AND INSTRUCTION THE DIFFERENCE OF MANNERS WHICH HE OBSERVED WAS TO HIM AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF INSTRUCTION AND AMUSEMENT
LITTLE DID I THEN EXPECT THE CALAMITY THAT WAS IN A FEW MOMENTS TO OVERWHELM ME AND EXTINGUISH IN HORROR AND DESPAIR ALL FEAR OF IGNOMINY OR DEATH
FOR A MOMENT MY SOUL WAS ELEVATED FROM ITS DEBASING AND MISERABLE FEARS TO CONTEMPLATE THE DIVINE IDEAS OF LIBERTY AND SELF SACRIFICE OF WHICH THESE SIGHTS WERE THE MONUMENTS AND THE REMEMBRANCERS
AS MORTAL AS THAT OF CRIME I VISITED EDINBURGH WITH LANGUID EYES AND MIND AND YET THAT CITY MIGHT HAVE INTERESTED THE MOST UNFORTUNATE BEING CLERVAL DID NOT LIKE IT SO WELL AS OXFORD
AND ASKED US IF THOSE WERE NOT SUFFICIENT ALLUREMENTS TO INDUCE US TO PROLONG OUR JOURNEY AS FAR NORTH AS PERTH WHERE HE RESIDED CLERVAL EAGERLY DESIRED TO ACCEPT THIS INVITATION AND I ALTHOUGH I ABHORRED SOCIETY
ARE YOU TO BE HAPPY WHILE I GROVEL IN THE INTENSITY OF MY WRETCHEDNESS YOU CAN BLAST MY OTHER PASSIONS BUT REVENGE REMAINS REVENGE HENCEFORTH DEARER THAN LIGHT OR FOOD
WOULD BE CHILDREN AND A RACE OF DEVILS WOULD BE PROPAGATED UPON THE EARTH WHO MIGHT MAKE THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE SPECIES OF MAN A CONDITION PRECARIOUS AND FULL OF TERROR HAD I RIGHT FOR MY OWN BENEFIT
THE WIND WAS HIGH AND THE WAVES CONTINUALLY THREATENED THE SAFETY OF MY LITTLE SKIFF
AND THE GREEN HILLS WANT THE CROWN OF DISTANT WHITE ALPS WHICH ALWAYS ATTEND ON THE PINY MOUNTAINS OF MY NATIVE COUNTRY WE VISITED THE WONDROUS CAVE AND THE LITTLE CABINETS OF NATURAL HISTORY
AND LAYING THEM UP DETERMINED TO THROW THEM INTO THE SEA THAT VERY NIGHT AND IN THE MEANTIME I SAT UPON THE BEACH EMPLOYED IN CLEANING AND ARRANGING MY CHEMICAL APPARATUS
AND I REMAINED IDLE IN A PAUSE OF CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER I SHOULD LEAVE MY LABOUR FOR THE NIGHT OR HASTEN ITS CONCLUSION BY AN UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO IT AS I SAT A TRAIN OF REFLECTION OCCURRED TO ME WHICH LED ME TO CONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF
I EASILY PERCEIVED THE TRACES OF CULTIVATION I SAW VESSELS NEAR THE SHORE AND FOUND MYSELF SUDDENLY TRANSPORTED BACK TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF CIVILIZED MAN I CAREFULLY TRACED THE WINDINGS OF THE LAND
AND THE ONLY CHECK TO HIS ENJOYMENTS WAS MY SORROWFUL AND DEJECTED MIND I TRIED TO CONCEAL THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT NOT DEBAR HIM FROM THE PLEASURES NATURAL TO ONE WHO WAS ENTERING ON A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UNDISTURBED BY
THAT I RESOLVED TO PROLONG MY STAY ON THE WATER AND FIXING THE RUDDER IN A DIRECT POSITION STRETCHED MYSELF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT CLOUDS HID THE MOON EVERYTHING WAS OBSCURE
IN YOUR SOLITARY RAMBLES THAN WITH THESE SCOTCH PEOPLE WHOM I DO NOT KNOW
THE REMAINS OF THE HALF FINISHED CREATURE WHOM I HAD DESTROYED
THIS WAS A NEW SCENE TO US MOUNTAINEERS THE MAJESTIC OAKS THE QUANTITY OF GAME AND THE HERDS OF STATELY DEER WERE ALL NOVELTIES TO US FROM THENCE WE PROCEEDED TO OXFORD
THE STREETS ARE ALMOST MAGNIFICENT AND THE LOVELY ISIS WHICH FLOWS BESIDE IT THROUGH MEADOWS OF EXQUISITE VERDURE IS SPREAD FORTH INTO A PLACID EXPANSE OF WATERS WHICH REFLECTS ITS MAJESTIC ASSEMBLAGE OF TOWERS AND SPIRES AND DOMES
AFTER PASSING SOME MONTHS IN LONDON WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A PERSON IN SCOTLAND WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN OUR VISITOR AT GENEVA HE MENTIONED THE BEAUTIES OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
AND QUICKLY AVAILED MYSELF OF THE LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION THAT I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME ADDRESSED TO THE MOST DISTINGUISHED NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS IF THIS JOURNEY HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING MY DAYS OF STUDY AND HAPPINESS IT WOULD HAVE AFFORDED ME INEXPRESSIBLE PLEASURE
YET STILL THE WORDS OF THE FIEND RANG IN MY EARS LIKE A DEATH KNELL THEY APPEARED LIKE A DREAM YET DISTINCT AND OPPRESSIVE AS A REALITY THE SUN HAD FAR DESCENDED
THE PROSPECT DID NOT MOVE ME TO FEAR YET WHEN I THOUGHT OF MY BELOVED ELIZABETH OF HER TEARS AND ENDLESS SORROW WHEN SHE SHOULD FIND HER LOVER SO BARBAROUSLY SNATCHED FROM HER TEARS
MY MIND WAS INTENTLY FIXED ON THE CONSUMMATION OF MY LABOUR AND MY EYES WERE SHUT TO THE HORROR OF MY PROCEEDINGS
WE HAD ARRIVED IN ENGLAND AT THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER AND IT WAS NOW FEBRUARY WE ACCORDINGLY DETERMINED TO COMMENCE OUR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE NORTH AT THE EXPIRATION OF ANOTHER MONTH IN THIS EXPEDITION
AND FILLED IT FOREVER WITH THE BITTEREST REMORSE I WAS NOW ABOUT TO FORM ANOTHER BEING OF WHOSE DISPOSITIONS I WAS ALIKE IGNORANT SHE MIGHT BECOME TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE MALIGNANT THAN HER MATE AND DELIGHT FOR ITS OWN SAKE
THUS SITUATED MY ONLY RESOURCE WAS TO DRIVE BEFORE THE WIND I CONFESS THAT I FELT A FEW SENSATIONS OF TERROR I HAD NO COMPASS WITH ME
I TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT I FELT A PRESENTIMENT OF WHO IT WAS
THE SIGHT OF WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL IN NATURE OR THE STUDY OF WHAT IS EXCELLENT AND SUBLIME IN THE PRODUCTIONS OF MAN COULD ALWAYS INTEREST MY HEART AND COMMUNICATE ELASTICITY TO MY SPIRITS BUT I AM A BLASTED TREE
AND THIS WAS TO ME LIKE THE TORTURE OF SINGLE DROPS OF WATER CONTINUALLY FALLING ON THE HEAD EVERY THOUGHT THAT WAS DEVOTED TO IT WAS AN EXTREME ANGUISH AND EVERY WORD THAT I SPOKE IN ALLUSION TO IT CAUSED MY LIPS TO QUIVER AND MY HEART TO PALPITATE
BUT I WAS IN NO MOOD TO LAUGH AND TALK WITH STRANGERS OR ENTER INTO THEIR FEELINGS OR PLANS WITH THE GOOD HUMOUR EXPECTED FROM A GUEST AND ACCORDINGLY I TOLD CLERVAL THAT I WISHED TO MAKE THE TOUR OF SCOTLAND ALONE
TO LEAVE MY SOLITARY ISLE AND TO MEET HIM AT PERTH THAT WE MIGHT PROCEED SOUTHWARDS TOGETHER THIS LETTER IN A DEGREE RECALLED ME TO LIFE AND I DETERMINED TO QUIT MY ISLAND AT THE EXPIRATION OF TWO DAYS
I WAS NOT SORRY I HAD NOW NEGLECTED MY PROMISE FOR SOME TIME AND I FEARED THE EFFECTS OF THE DAEMON'S DISAPPOINTMENT HE MIGHT REMAIN IN SWITZERLAND AND WREAK HIS VENGEANCE ON MY RELATIVES
THE FIRST I HAD SHED FOR MANY MONTHS STREAMED FROM MY EYES AND I RESOLVED NOT TO FALL BEFORE MY ENEMY WITHOUT A BITTER STRUGGLE THE NIGHT PASSED AWAY
AND MY HEART FAILED WITHIN ME WHEN ON LOOKING UP I SAW BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON THE DAEMON AT THE CASEMENT A GHASTLY GRIN WRINKLED HIS LIPS AS HE GAZED ON ME
AND ONE OF THESE WAS VACANT WHEN I ARRIVED THIS I HIRED IT CONTAINED BUT TWO ROOMS AND THESE EXHIBITED ALL THE SQUALIDNESS OF THE MOST MISERABLE PENURY THE THATCH HAD FALLEN IN THE WALLS WERE UNPLASTERED
SEVERAL HOURS PASSED AND I REMAINED NEAR MY WINDOW GAZING ON THE SEA IT WAS ALMOST MOTIONLESS FOR THE WINDS WERE HUSHED AND ALL NATURE REPOSED UNDER THE EYE OF THE QUIET MOON
