BELIEVE IT TO BE MOST FERVENT MOST UNDEVIATING IN F W I MUST GO UNCERTAIN OF MY FATE BUT I SHALL RETURN HITHER OR FOLLOW YOUR PARTY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE A WORD
SHE HOPED TO BE WISE AND REASONABLE IN TIME BUT ALAS ALAS SHE MUST CONFESS TO HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT WISE YET
BUT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HIS GLOVES AND INSTANTLY CROSSING THE ROOM TO THE WRITING TABLE HE DREW OUT A LETTER FROM UNDER THE SCATTERED PAPER PLACED IT BEFORE ANNE WITH EYES OF GLOWING ENTREATY FIXED ON HER FOR A TIME
THE SERVANT CAME IN TO ANNOUNCE IT IT WAS BEGINNING TO RAIN AGAIN AND ALTOGETHER THERE WAS A DELAY AND A BUSTLE AND A TALKING WHICH MUST MAKE ALL THE LITTLE CROWD IN THE SHOP UNDERSTAND THAT LADY DALRYMPLE WAS CALLING TO CONVEY MISS ELLIOT
KELLYNCH HALL AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE OF DOUBT AND INDECISION THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT THERE HAD BEEN THREE ALTERNATIVES LONDON BATH
TO THEIR PROTECTION SHE MUST TRUST AND SINKING INTO THE CHAIR WHICH HE HAD OCCUPIED SUCCEEDING TO THE VERY SPOT WHERE HE HAD LEANED AND WRITTEN
WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S RETRENCHING AND WHO WAS PERFECTLY PERSUADED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE WITHOUT A CHANGE OF ABODE
I HAVE GREAT HOPE OF PREVAILING WE MUST BE SERIOUS AND DECIDED FOR AFTER ALL
AND THOUGH A GREAT DEAL IS DUE TO THE FEELINGS OF THE GENTLEMAN AND THE HEAD OF A HOUSE LIKE YOUR FATHER THERE IS STILL MORE DUE TO THE CHARACTER OF AN HONEST MAN THIS WAS THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH ANNE WANTED HER FATHER TO BE PROCEEDING HIS FRIENDS TO BE URGING HIM
FROM HER HAPPENING TO BE NOT IN PERFECTLY GOOD SPIRITS THE ONLY WINTER WHICH SHE HAD AFTERWARDS SPENT THERE WITH HERSELF LADY RUSSELL WAS FOND OF BATH IN SHORT AND DISPOSED TO THINK IT MUST SUIT THEM ALL
SHE WAS OF STRICT INTEGRITY HERSELF WITH A DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR BUT SHE WAS AS DESIROUS OF SAVING SIR WALTER'S FEELINGS AS SOLICITOUS FOR THE CREDIT OF THE FAMILY AS ARISTOCRATIC IN HER IDEAS OF WHAT WAS DUE TO THEM AS ANYBODY OF SENSE AND HONESTY COULD WELL BE
AT LAST LADY RUSSELL DREW BACK HER HEAD NOW HOW WOULD SHE SPEAK OF HIM YOU WILL WONDER SAID SHE WHAT HAS BEEN FIXING MY EYE SO LONG BUT I WAS LOOKING AFTER SOME WINDOW CURTAINS WHICH LADY ALICIA AND MISSUS FRANKLAND WERE TELLING ME OF LAST NIGHT
HE WOULD SOONER QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AT ONCE THAN REMAIN IN IT ON SUCH DISGRACEFUL TERMS QUIT KELLYNCH HALL THE HINT WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN UP BY MISTER SHEPHERD WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S RETRENCHING
AND I DO NOT THINK I EVER OPENED A BOOK IN MY LIFE WHICH HAD NOT SOMETHING TO SAY UPON WOMAN'S INCONSTANCY SONGS AND PROVERBS ALL TALK OF WOMAN'S FICKLENESS BUT PERHAPS YOU WILL SAY THESE WERE ALL WRITTEN BY MEN
WHEN ANNE COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT UPPERCROSS WAS ALREADY QUITE ALIVE AGAIN THOUGH NEITHER HENRIETTA NOR LOUISA NOR CHARLES HAYTER NOR CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WERE THERE
AND WHEN THEY DINED WITH THE HARVILLES THERE HAD BEEN ONLY A MAID SERVANT TO WAIT AND AT FIRST MISSUS HARVILLE HAD ALWAYS GIVEN MISSUS MUSGROVE PRECEDENCE BUT THEN SHE HAD RECEIVED SO VERY HANDSOME AN APOLOGY FROM HER ON FINDING OUT WHOSE DAUGHTER SHE WAS
YOUR FEELINGS MAY BE THE STRONGEST REPLIED ANNE BUT THE SAME SPIRIT OF ANALOGY WILL AUTHORISE ME TO ASSERT THAT OURS ARE THE MOST TENDER MAN IS MORE ROBUST THAN WOMAN
AND NOW IF SHE WERE BY ANY CHANCE TO BE THROWN INTO COMPANY WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HER IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE MATTER MIGHT ADD ANOTHER SHADE OF PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM THE FOLLOWING MORNING ANNE WAS OUT WITH HER FRIEND AND FOR THE FIRST HOUR IN AN INCESSANT AND FEARFUL SORT OF WATCH FOR HIM IN VAIN
UNABLE TO LET HER FINISH HER SPEECH
THAT IT IS NOT PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD PRAY BE SO GOOD AS TO MENTION TO THE OTHER GENTLEMEN THAT WE HOPE TO SEE YOUR WHOLE PARTY THIS EVENING I AM AFRAID THERE HAD BEEN SOME MISTAKE AND I WISH YOU PARTICULARLY TO ASSURE CAPTAIN HARVILLE AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THAT WE HOPE TO SEE THEM BOTH
HE CAME IN WITH EAGERNESS APPEARED TO SEE AND THINK ONLY OF HER
GIVE HIM A BOOK AND HE WILL READ ALL DAY LONG YES THAT HE WILL EXCLAIMED MARY TAUNTINGLY HE WILL SIT PORING OVER HIS BOOK AND NOT KNOW WHEN A PERSON SPEAKS TO HIM OR WHEN ONE DROP'S ONE'S SCISSORS OR
LADY RUSSELL WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD SEE HIM SOMEWHERE WOULD SHE RECOLLECT HIM HOW WOULD IT ALL BE SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN OBLIGED TO TELL LADY RUSSELL THAT LOUISA MUSGROVE WAS TO MARRY CAPTAIN BENWICK IT HAD COST HER SOMETHING TO ENCOUNTER LADY RUSSELL'S SURPRISE
DO YOU THINK LADY RUSSELL WOULD LIKE THAT LADY RUSSELL COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING UPON MY WORD SAID SHE I SHOULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT MY OPINION OF ANY ONE COULD HAVE ADMITTED OF SUCH DIFFERENCE OF CONJECTURE
SIR WALTER SPURNED THE IDEA OF ITS BEING OFFERED IN ANY MANNER FORBAD THE SLIGHTEST HINT BEING DROPPED OF HIS HAVING SUCH AN INTENTION AND IT WAS ONLY ON THE SUPPOSITION OF HIS BEING SPONTANEOUSLY SOLICITED BY SOME MOST UNEXCEPTIONABLE APPLICANT ON HIS OWN TERMS
I SUPPOSE HE WAS AFRAID OF FINDING IT DULL BUT UPON MY WORD I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WERE LIVELY ENOUGH AT THE COTTAGE FOR SUCH A HEART BROKEN MAN AS CAPTAIN BENWICK CHARLES LAUGHED AGAIN AND SAID NOW MARY YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW IT REALLY WAS IT WAS ALL YOUR DOING TURNING TO ANNE
AND ANXIOUS TO GET HER AWAY WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS OF TIME AND BEFORE THE RAIN INCREASED AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT THEY WALKED OFF TOGETHER HER ARM UNDER HIS A GENTLE AND EMBARRASSED GLANCE AND A GOOD MORNING TO YOU BEING ALL THAT SHE HAD TIME FOR AS SHE PASSED AWAY
SHE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF HIM IN THE PREPARATION OF THE LAST FEW MOMENTS ALL THE OVERPOWERING BLINDING BEWILDERING FIRST EFFECTS OF STRONG SURPRISE WERE OVER WITH HER STILL HOWEVER SHE HAD ENOUGH TO FEEL IT WAS AGITATION PAIN PLEASURE
GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD UNDERVALUE THE WARM AND FAITHFUL FEELINGS OF ANY OF MY FELLOW CREATURES I SHOULD DESERVE UTTER CONTEMPT IF I DARED TO SUPPOSE THAT TRUE ATTACHMENT AND CONSTANCY WERE KNOWN ONLY BY WOMAN NO
THE UNDESIRABLENESS OF ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR SIR WALTER WAS CERTAINLY MUCH STRENGTHENED BY ONE PART AND A VERY MATERIAL PART OF THE SCHEME WHICH HAD BEEN HAPPILY ENGRAFTED ON THE BEGINNING HE WAS NOT ONLY TO QUIT HIS HOME
I MUST SEE CAPTAIN BENWICK BEFORE I DECIDE SAID LADY RUSSELL SMILING
AS BEING THE HANDSOMEST AND BEST HUNG OF ANY IN BATH BUT COULD NOT RECOLLECT THE EXACT NUMBER AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH IT COULD BE BUT I CONFESS I CAN SEE NO CURTAINS HEREABOUTS THAT ANSWER THEIR DESCRIPTION ANNE SIGHED
OR HE WAS TOO SHY AND AFTER GIVING HIM A WEEK'S INDULGENCE LADY RUSSELL DETERMINED HIM TO BE UNWORTHY OF THE INTEREST WHICH HE HAD BEEN BEGINNING TO EXCITE THE MUSGROVES CAME BACK TO RECEIVE THEIR HAPPY BOYS AND GIRLS FROM SCHOOL
IF WE CAN PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO ALL THIS SAID LADY RUSSELL LOOKING OVER HER PAPER MUCH MAY BE DONE IF HE WILL ADOPT THESE REGULATIONS IN SEVEN YEARS HE WILL BE CLEAR AND I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM AND ELIZABETH
SHE RATED LADY RUSSELL'S INFLUENCE HIGHLY AND AS TO THE SEVERE DEGREE OF SELF DENIAL WHICH HER OWN CONSCIENCE PROMPTED SHE BELIEVED THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE MORE DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING THEM TO A COMPLETE THAN TO HALF A REFORMATION
AND CAPTAIN HARVILLE TO CAPTAIN WENTWORTH AND SHE IMMEDIATELY HEARD THAT MARY AND HENRIETTA TOO IMPATIENT TO WAIT HAD GONE OUT THE MOMENT IT HAD CLEARED BUT WOULD BE BACK AGAIN SOON AND THAT THE STRICTEST INJUNCTIONS HAD BEEN LEFT WITH MISSUS MUSGROVE
TRUE SAID ANNE VERY TRUE I DID NOT RECOLLECT BUT WHAT SHALL WE SAY NOW CAPTAIN HARVILLE IF THE CHANGE BE NOT FROM OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCES
WHOM I HAVE NO WISH TO SEE HIS DECLINING TO BE ON CORDIAL TERMS WITH THE HEAD OF HIS FAMILY HAS LEFT A VERY STRONG IMPRESSION IN HIS DISFAVOUR WITH ME
WELL MISS ELLIOT LOWERING HIS VOICE
SHE CONSIDERED IT AS AN ACT OF INDISPENSABLE DUTY TO CLEAR AWAY THE CLAIMS OF CREDITORS WITH ALL THE EXPEDITION WHICH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RETRENCHMENTS COULD SECURE AND SAW NO DIGNITY IN ANYTHING SHORT OF IT SHE WANTED IT TO BE PRESCRIBED AND FELT AS A DUTY
THERE IS STILL MORE DUE TO THE CHARACTER OF AN HONEST MAN
BUT NOT FROM ANY MAD IDEA OF HER RECOGNISING HIM SO SOON AS SHE DID HERSELF NO IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT LADY RUSSELL WOULD PERCEIVE HIM TILL THEY WERE NEARLY OPPOSITE SHE LOOKED AT HER HOWEVER FROM TIME TO TIME ANXIOUSLY AND WHEN THE MOMENT APPROACHED WHICH MUST POINT HIM OUT
NO MAN AND WOMAN WOULD PROBABLY BUT LET ME OBSERVE THAT ALL HISTORIES ARE AGAINST YOU ALL STORIES PROSE AND VERSE IF I HAD SUCH A MEMORY AS BENWICK I COULD BRING YOU FIFTY QUOTATIONS IN A MOMENT ON MY SIDE THE ARGUMENT
AND ON MANY LESSER OCCASIONS HAD ENDEAVOURED TO GIVE ELIZABETH THE ADVANTAGE OF HER OWN BETTER JUDGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE BUT ALWAYS IN VAIN ELIZABETH WOULD GO HER OWN WAY AND NEVER HAD SHE PURSUED IT IN MORE DECIDED OPPOSITION TO LADY RUSSELL THAN IN THIS SELECTION OF MISSUS CLAY
WHICH SEEMED ITS NATURAL CHARACTER LOOK HERE SAID HE UNFOLDING A PARCEL IN HIS HAND AND DISPLAYING A SMALL MINIATURE PAINTING DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS CERTAINLY CAPTAIN BENWICK
SHE HAD ONLY TIME HOWEVER TO MOVE CLOSER TO THE TABLE WHERE HE HAD BEEN WRITING WHEN FOOTSTEPS WERE HEARD RETURNING THE DOOR OPENED IT WAS HIMSELF HE BEGGED THEIR PARDON
IT IS WHAT I ALWAYS PROTESTED AGAINST FOR MY CHILDREN IT IS ALL VERY WELL I USED TO SAY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ENGAGED IF THERE IS A CERTAINTY OF THEIR BEING ABLE TO MARRY IN SIX MONTHS OR EVEN IN TWELVE BUT A LONG ENGAGEMENT
SHE WAS A BENEVOLENT CHARITABLE GOOD WOMAN AND CAPABLE OF STRONG ATTACHMENTS MOST CORRECT IN HER CONDUCT STRICT IN HER NOTIONS OF DECORUM AND WITH MANNERS THAT WERE HELD A STANDARD OF GOOD BREEDING
IN WHATEVER WAY HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE OF DOUBT AND INDECISION THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT
HE UNDERTAKES IT LOOKING TOWARDS CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HE IS WRITING ABOUT IT NOW AND WITH A QUIVERING LIP HE WOUND UP THE WHOLE BY ADDING POOR FANNY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN HIM SO SOON
THAT DID NOT ADMIT OF A DOUBT BUT SHE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT DONE WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE PAIN TO HIM AND ELIZABETH SHE DREW UP PLANS OF ECONOMY SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING SHE CONSULTED ANNE
CAPTAIN HARVILLE HOLDS HIMSELF QUITE ENGAGED I'LL ANSWER FOR IT AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH THE SAME I DARE SAY ANNE COULD DO NO MORE BUT HER HEART PROPHESIED SOME MISCHANCE TO DAMP THE PERFECTION OF HER FELICITY IT COULD NOT BE VERY LASTING HOWEVER
AND THEN IF I COULD CONVEY TO YOU THE GLOW OF HIS SOUL WHEN HE DOES SEE THEM AGAIN WHEN
SHE HAD A CULTIVATED MIND AND WAS GENERALLY SPEAKING RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT BUT SHE HAD PREJUDICES ON THE SIDE OF ANCESTRY SHE HAD A VALUE FOR RANK AND CONSEQUENCE WHICH BLINDED HER A LITTLE TO THE FAULTS OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED THEM
TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT ITS MORE CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM KELLYNCH ONLY FIFTY MILES AND LADY RUSSELL'S SPENDING SOME PART OF EVERY WINTER THERE AND TO THE VERY GREAT SATISFACTION OF LADY RUSSELL
SHE HAD ONLY TO SUBMIT SIT DOWN BE OUTWARDLY COMPOSED AND FEEL HERSELF PLUNGED AT ONCE IN ALL THE AGITATIONS WHICH SHE HAD MERELY LAID HER ACCOUNT OF TASTING A LITTLE BEFORE THE MORNING CLOSED
AND HASTILY COLLECTING HIS GLOVES WAS AGAIN OUT OF THE ROOM ALMOST BEFORE MISSUS MUSGROVE WAS AWARE OF HIS BEING IN IT THE WORK OF AN INSTANT THE REVOLUTION WHICH ONE INSTANT HAD MADE IN ANNE WAS ALMOST BEYOND EXPRESSION THE LETTER
SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION SHE HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY VERY EARNEST IN TRYING TO GET ANNE INCLUDED IN THE VISIT TO LONDON
BUT HE IS NOT LONGER LIVED WHICH EXACTLY EXPLAINS MY VIEW OF THE NATURE OF THEIR ATTACHMENTS NAY IT WOULD BE TOO HARD UPON YOU IF IT WERE OTHERWISE
SHE WOULD HARDLY ALLOW IT EVEN TO DROP AT ALL AND HER BOOTS WERE SO THICK MUCH THICKER THAN MISS ANNE'S AND IN SHORT HER CIVILITY RENDERED HER QUITE AS ANXIOUS TO BE LEFT TO WALK WITH MISTER ELLIOT AS ANNE COULD BE AND IT WAS DISCUSSED BETWEEN THEM WITH A GENEROSITY SO POLITE AND SO DETERMINED
I LITTLE THOUGHT THEN BUT NO MATTER THIS WAS DRAWN AT THE CAPE HE MET WITH A CLEVER YOUNG GERMAN ARTIST AT THE CAPE AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH A PROMISE TO MY POOR SISTER SAT TO HIM AND WAS BRINGING IT HOME FOR HER
SHE WAS LOST AND WHEN SHE HAD SCOLDED BACK HER SENSES SHE FOUND THE OTHERS STILL WAITING FOR THE CARRIAGE AND MISTER ELLIOT ALWAYS OBLIGING JUST SETTING OFF FOR UNION STREET ON A COMMISSION OF MISSUS CLAY'S SHE NOW FELT A GREAT INCLINATION TO GO TO THE OUTER DOOR SHE WANTED TO SEE IF IT RAINED
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR TASTE IN NOISES AS WELL AS IN OTHER MATTERS AND SOUNDS ARE QUITE INNOXIOUS OR MOST DISTRESSING BY THEIR SORT RATHER THAN THEIR QUANTITY WHEN LADY RUSSELL NOT LONG AFTERWARDS WAS ENTERING BATH ON A WET AFTERNOON
WE ASKED HIM TO COME HOME WITH US FOR A DAY OR TWO CHARLES UNDERTOOK TO GIVE HIM SOME SHOOTING AND HE
MUTUAL ENQUIRIES ON COMMON SUBJECTS PASSED NEITHER OF THEM PROBABLY MUCH THE WISER FOR WHAT THEY HEARD AND ANNE CONTINUING FULLY SENSIBLE OF HIS BEING LESS AT EASE THAN FORMERLY
I BELIEVE THE REVERSE I BELIEVE IN A TRUE ANALOGY BETWEEN OUR BODILY FRAMES AND OUR MENTAL AND THAT AS OUR BODIES ARE THE STRONGEST SO ARE OUR FEELINGS CAPABLE OF BEARING MOST ROUGH USAGE AND RIDING OUT THE HEAVIEST WEATHER
IF I COULD BUT MAKE YOU COMPREHEND WHAT A MAN SUFFERS WHEN HE TAKES A LAST LOOK AT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND WATCHES THE BOAT THAT HE HAS SENT THEM OFF IN AS LONG AS IT IS IN SIGHT AND THEN TURNS AWAY AND SAYS GOD KNOWS WHETHER WE EVER MEET AGAIN
BECAME GRADUALLY SENSIBLE THAT HE WAS INVITING HER TO JOIN HIM WHERE HE STOOD HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A SMILE AND A LITTLE MOTION OF THE HEAD WHICH EXPRESSED COME TO ME I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
ELIZABETH HAD BEEN LATELY FORMING AN INTIMACY WHICH SHE WISHED TO SEE INTERRUPTED IT WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER SHEPHERD WHO HAD RETURNED AFTER AN UNPROSPEROUS MARRIAGE TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE WITH THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF TWO CHILDREN
SHE DREW UP PLANS OF ECONOMY SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING SHE CONSULTED ANNE WHO NEVER SEEMED CONSIDERED BY THE OTHERS AS HAVING ANY INTEREST IN THE QUESTION
IT IS NOT THE FASHION TO SAY SO BUT I CONFESS I ADMIRE HER MORE THAN HER SISTER
AS IF HEAVEN HAD GIVEN THEM WINGS BY MANY HOURS SOONER STILL IF I COULD EXPLAIN TO YOU ALL THIS AND ALL THAT A MAN CAN BEAR AND DO AND GLORIES TO DO FOR THE SAKE OF THESE TREASURES OF HIS EXISTENCE I SPEAK YOU KNOW
SAID CHARLES THOUGH HE HAD NOT NERVES FOR COMING AWAY WITH US AND SETTING OFF AGAIN AFTERWARDS TO PAY A FORMAL VISIT HERE HE WILL MAKE HIS WAY OVER TO KELLYNCH ONE DAY BY HIMSELF YOU MAY DEPEND ON IT I TOLD HIM THE DISTANCE AND THE ROAD AND I TOLD HIM OF THE CHURCH'S BEING SO VERY WELL WORTH SEEING
ELIZABETH HAD BEEN LATELY FORMING AN INTIMACY WHICH SHE WISHED TO SEE INTERRUPTED IT WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER SHEPHERD WHO HAD RETURNED AFTER AN UNPROSPEROUS MARRIAGE TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE WITH THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF TWO CHILDREN
AND SO DO I NO COMPARISON BUT THE MEN ARE ALL WILD AFTER MISS ELLIOT ANNE IS TOO DELICATE FOR THEM
SHE WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM BUT DECLINED IT ALL REPEATING HER CONVICTION THAT THE RAIN WOULD COME TO NOTHING AT PRESENT AND ADDING I AM ONLY WAITING FOR MISTER ELLIOT
UNDER HIS PRESENT DIFFICULTIES THEY MUST RETRENCH THAT DID NOT ADMIT OF A DOUBT BUT SHE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT DONE WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE PAIN TO HIM AND ELIZABETH SHE DREW UP PLANS OF ECONOMY
HE MIGHT THERE BE IMPORTANT AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EXPENSE TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT ITS MORE CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM KELLYNCH ONLY FIFTY MILES AND LADY RUSSELL'S SPENDING SOME PART OF EVERY WINTER THERE
SHE DISLIKED BATH AND DID NOT THINK IT AGREED WITH HER AND BATH WAS TO BE HER HOME SIR WALTER HAD AT FIRST THOUGHT MORE OF LONDON
ANNE FELT THAT SHE DID NOT BELONG TO THE CONVERSATION AND YET AS CAPTAIN HARVILLE SEEMED THOUGHTFUL AND NOT DISPOSED TO TALK SHE COULD NOT AVOID HEARING MANY UNDESIRABLE PARTICULARS SUCH AS
YES AND YOU MAY GUESS WHO IT IS FOR BUT IN A DEEP TONE IT WAS NOT DONE FOR HER MISS ELLIOT DO YOU REMEMBER OUR WALKING TOGETHER AT LYME AND GRIEVING FOR HIM
WHERE THEY MIGHT STILL HAVE LADY RUSSELL'S SOCIETY STILL BE NEAR MARY AND STILL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES SEEING THE LAWNS AND GROVES OF KELLYNCH WAS THE OBJECT OF HER AMBITION BUT THE USUAL FATE OF ANNE ATTENDED HER IN HAVING SOMETHING VERY OPPOSITE FROM HER INCLINATION FIXED ON
LADY RUSSELL WAS MOST ANXIOUSLY ZEALOUS ON THE SUBJECT AND GAVE IT MUCH SERIOUS CONSIDERATION SHE WAS A WOMAN RATHER OF SOUND THAN OF QUICK ABILITIES WHOSE DIFFICULTIES IN COMING TO ANY DECISION IN THIS INSTANCE WERE GREAT
THERE IS NO HURRY ON MY SIDE I AM ONLY READY WHENEVER YOU ARE I AM IN VERY GOOD ANCHORAGE HERE SMILING AT ANNE WELL SUPPLIED AND WANT FOR NOTHING NO HURRY FOR A SIGNAL AT ALL
SHE HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY VERY EARNEST IN TRYING TO GET ANNE INCLUDED IN THE VISIT TO LONDON SENSIBLY OPEN TO ALL THE INJUSTICE
UNJUST I MAY HAVE BEEN WEAK AND RESENTFUL I HAVE BEEN BUT NEVER INCONSTANT YOU ALONE HAVE BROUGHT ME TO BATH FOR YOU ALONE I THINK AND PLAN HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THIS CAN YOU FAIL TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD MY WISHES
CONCLUDED A SHORT RECAPITULATION OF WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED HERSELF BY OBSERVING WITH A HAPPY GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM THAT AFTER ALL SHE HAD GONE THROUGH NOTHING WAS SO LIKELY TO DO HER GOOD AS A LITTLE QUIET CHEERFULNESS AT HOME LOUISA WAS NOW RECOVERING APACE
HOW MISTER MUSGROVE AND MY BROTHER HAYTER HAD MET AGAIN AND AGAIN TO TALK IT OVER WHAT MY BROTHER HAYTER HAD SAID ONE DAY AND WHAT MISTER MUSGROVE HAD PROPOSED THE NEXT AND WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO MY SISTER HAYTER AND WHAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD WISHED
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE ONE DAY ONLY HAD PASSED SINCE ANNE'S CONVERSATION WITH MISSUS SMITH BUT A KEENER INTEREST HAD SUCCEEDED AND SHE WAS NOW SO LITTLE TOUCHED BY MISTER ELLIOT'S CONDUCT EXCEPT BY ITS EFFECTS IN ONE QUARTER
WOULD HAVE DEEMED SUCH A DOMESTIC HURRICANE A BAD RESTORATIVE OF THE NERVES WHICH LOUISA'S ILLNESS MUST HAVE SO GREATLY SHAKEN BUT MISSUS MUSGROVE WHO GOT ANNE NEAR HER ON PURPOSE TO THANK HER MOST CORDIALLY AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR ALL HER ATTENTIONS TO THEM
BUT MARY DID NOT GIVE INTO IT VERY GRACIOUSLY WHETHER FROM NOT CONSIDERING CAPTAIN BENWICK ENTITLED BY BIRTH AND SITUATION TO BE IN LOVE WITH AN ELLIOT OR FROM NOT WANTING TO BELIEVE ANNE A GREATER ATTRACTION TO UPPERCROSS THAN HERSELF MUST BE LEFT TO BE GUESSED
AND BEFORE SHE WAS BEYOND THE FIRST STAGE OF FULL SENSATION CHARLES MARY AND HENRIETTA ALL CAME IN THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF SEEMING LIKE HERSELF PRODUCED THEN AN IMMEDIATE STRUGGLE BUT AFTER A WHILE SHE COULD DO NO MORE
MEN HAVE HAD EVERY ADVANTAGE OF US IN TELLING THEIR OWN STORY EDUCATION HAS BEEN THEIRS IN SO MUCH HIGHER A DEGREE THE PEN HAS BEEN IN THEIR HANDS I WILL NOT ALLOW BOOKS TO PROVE ANYTHING BUT HOW SHALL WE PROVE ANYTHING
WERE WALKING OFF AND CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WATCHING THEM TURNED AGAIN TO ANNE AND BY MANNER RATHER THAN WORDS WAS OFFERING HIS SERVICES TO HER I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU WAS HER ANSWER BUT I AM NOT GOING WITH THEM THE CARRIAGE WOULD NOT ACCOMMODATE SO MANY I WALK
AND YOU ARE DISENGAGED FREDERICK ARE YOU NOT AS WELL AS OURSELVES CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WAS FOLDING UP A LETTER IN GREAT HASTE AND EITHER COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT ANSWER FULLY YES SAID HE VERY TRUE
NOT EASY NOT ABLE TO FEIGN THAT HE WAS IT DID NOT SURPRISE BUT IT GRIEVED ANNE TO OBSERVE THAT ELIZABETH WOULD NOT KNOW HIM SHE SAW THAT HE SAW ELIZABETH THAT ELIZABETH SAW HIM THAT THERE WAS COMPLETE INTERNAL RECOGNITION ON EACH SIDE
FOR I HAVE BEEN SEEING HIM EVERY DAY THIS LAST FORTNIGHT WELL AS YOUR JOINT ACQUAINTANCE THEN I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE CAPTAIN BENWICK
SIR WALTER COULD NOT HAVE BORNE THE DEGRADATION OF BEING KNOWN TO DESIGN LETTING HIS HOUSE MISTER SHEPHERD HAD ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD ADVERTISE BUT NEVER DARED APPROACH IT AGAIN SIR WALTER SPURNED THE IDEA OF ITS BEING OFFERED IN ANY MANNER
IT WAS A MUCH SAFER PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN IN HIS PREDICAMENT HE MIGHT THERE BE IMPORTANT AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EXPENSE TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT
IT IS PERHAPS OUR FATE RATHER THAN OUR MERIT WE CANNOT HELP OURSELVES WE LIVE AT HOME QUIET CONFINED AND OUR FEELINGS PREY UPON US YOU ARE FORCED ON EXERTION
HE HAD TALKED OF GOING DOWN TO PLYMOUTH FOR A WEEK AND WANTED TO PERSUADE CAPTAIN BENWICK TO GO WITH HIM BUT AS CHARLES MAINTAINED TO THE LAST CAPTAIN BENWICK SEEMED MUCH MORE DISPOSED TO RIDE OVER TO KELLYNCH
BUT I CAN DISTINGUISH THE TONES OF THAT VOICE WHEN THEY WOULD BE LOST ON OTHERS TOO GOOD TOO EXCELLENT CREATURE YOU DO US JUSTICE INDEED YOU DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS TRUE ATTACHMENT AND CONSTANCY AMONG MEN
MARY'S FACE WAS CLOUDED DIRECTLY CHARLES LAUGHED OH CAPTAIN BENWICK IS VERY WELL I BELIEVE
WHY WAS SHE TO SUSPECT HERSELF OF ANOTHER MOTIVE CAPTAIN WENTWORTH MUST BE OUT OF SIGHT SHE LEFT HER SEAT SHE WOULD GO
IS THAT OF LOVING LONGEST WHEN EXISTENCE OR WHEN HOPE IS GONE SHE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY HAVE UTTERED ANOTHER SENTENCE HER HEART WAS TOO FULL HER BREATH TOO MUCH OPPRESSED
SHE HAD A VALUE FOR RANK AND CONSEQUENCE WHICH BLINDED HER A LITTLE TO THE FAULTS OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED THEM HERSELF THE WIDOW OF ONLY A KNIGHT SHE GAVE THE DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE AND SIR WALTER
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT LADY RUSSELL AND ANNE WERE BOTH OCCASIONALLY THINKING OF CAPTAIN BENWICK FROM THIS TIME LADY RUSSELL COULD NOT HEAR THE DOOR BELL WITHOUT FEELING THAT IT MIGHT BE HIS HERALD NOR COULD ANNE RETURN FROM ANY STROLL OF SOLITARY INDULGENCE IN HER FATHER'S GROUNDS
I MEAN WHILE THE WOMAN YOU LOVE LIVES AND LIVES FOR YOU ALL THE PRIVILEGE I CLAIM FOR MY OWN SEX
WHOEVER SUFFERED INCONVENIENCE SHE MUST SUFFER NONE BUT IT OCCUPIED A LITTLE TIME TO SETTLE THE POINT OF CIVILITY BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO THE RAIN WAS A MERE TRIFLE AND ANNE WAS MOST SINCERE IN PREFERRING A WALK WITH MISTER ELLIOT
MAY BE PRECISELY SUCH AS CANNOT BE BROUGHT FORWARD WITHOUT BETRAYING A CONFIDENCE OR IN SOME RESPECT SAYING WHAT SHOULD NOT BE SAID AH CRIED CAPTAIN HARVILLE IN A TONE OF STRONG FEELING
THEY HAD BY DINT OF BEING SO VERY MUCH TOGETHER GOT TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER WITH A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF APPARENT INDIFFERENCE AND CALMNESS BUT HE COULD NOT DO IT NOW TIME HAD CHANGED HIM OR LOUISA HAD CHANGED HIM THERE WAS CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME SORT OR OTHER
THE CHAIR WAS EARNESTLY PROTESTED AGAINST AND MISSUS MUSGROVE WHO THOUGHT ONLY OF ONE SORT OF ILLNESS HAVING ASSURED HERSELF WITH SOME ANXIETY THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO FALL IN THE CASE
WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S RETRENCHING
THAT THE OTHERS WERE OBLIGED TO SETTLE IT FOR THEM MISS ELLIOT MAINTAINING THAT MISSUS CLAY HAD A LITTLE COLD ALREADY AND MISTER ELLIOT DECIDING ON APPEAL THAT HIS COUSIN ANNE'S BOOTS WERE RATHER THE THICKEST IT WAS FIXED ACCORDINGLY
WAS AS BEING SIR WALTER IN HER APPREHENSION ENTITLED TO A GREAT DEAL OF COMPASSION AND CONSIDERATION UNDER HIS PRESENT DIFFICULTIES THEY MUST RETRENCH THAT DID NOT ADMIT OF A DOUBT BUT SHE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT DONE WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE PAIN TO HIM AND ELIZABETH
WHICH WAS AT LAST SUBMITTED TO SIR WALTER EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE
THAT KELLYNCH HALL HAS A RESPECTABILITY IN ITSELF WHICH CANNOT BE AFFECTED BY THESE REDUCTIONS AND THAT THE TRUE DIGNITY OF SIR WALTER ELLIOT WILL BE VERY FAR FROM LESSENED IN THE EYES OF SENSIBLE PEOPLE
IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT HIS PEN HAD FALLEN DOWN BUT ANNE WAS STARTLED AT FINDING HIM NEARER THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED AND HALF INCLINED TO SUSPECT THAT THE PEN HAD ONLY FALLEN BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY THEM
BY PASSING ALL THE WARM MONTHS WITH HER AT KELLYNCH LODGE EVERY DANGER WOULD BE AVOIDED AND IT WAS IN FACT A CHANGE WHICH MUST DO BOTH HEALTH AND SPIRITS GOOD ANNE HAD BEEN TOO LITTLE FROM HOME TOO LITTLE SEEN HER SPIRITS WERE NOT HIGH
AND HE TURNED ROUND THE NEXT INSTANT TO GIVE A LOOK ONE QUICK CONSCIOUS LOOK AT HER THE TWO LADIES CONTINUED TO TALK TO RE URGE THE SAME ADMITTED TRUTHS
WHAT EVERY COMFORT OF LIFE KNOCKED OFF JOURNEYS LONDON SERVANTS HORSES TABLE CONTRACTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS EVERY WHERE TO LIVE NO LONGER WITH THE DECENCIES EVEN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN NO
AS ARISTOCRATIC IN HER IDEAS OF WHAT WAS DUE TO THEM AS ANYBODY OF SENSE AND HONESTY COULD WELL BE SHE WAS A BENEVOLENT CHARITABLE GOOD WOMAN AND CAPABLE OF STRONG ATTACHMENTS MOST CORRECT IN HER CONDUCT
HE IS ONE OF THE DULLEST YOUNG MEN THAT EVER LIVED
AND WHAT I SAID AT FIRST I NEVER COULD CONSENT TO BUT WAS AFTERWARDS PERSUADED TO THINK MIGHT DO VERY WELL AND A GREAT DEAL IN THE SAME STYLE OF OPEN HEARTED COMMUNICATION MINUTIAE WHICH
HER SPIRITS WERE NOT HIGH A LARGER SOCIETY WOULD IMPROVE THEM SHE WANTED HER TO BE MORE KNOWN THE UNDESIRABLENESS OF ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR SIR WALTER WAS CERTAINLY MUCH STRENGTHENED BY ONE PART AND A VERY MATERIAL PART OF THE SCHEME
EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUSTICE AND EQUITY
THERE WAS NO DELAY NO WASTE OF TIME SHE WAS DEEP IN THE HAPPINESS OF SUCH MISERY OR THE MISERY OF SUCH HAPPINESS INSTANTLY TWO MINUTES AFTER HER ENTERING THE ROOM CAPTAIN WENTWORTH SAID
THAT THEY SHOULD LOSE NEITHER CONSEQUENCE NOR ENJOYMENT BY SETTLING THERE LADY RUSSELL FELT OBLIGED TO OPPOSE HER DEAR ANNE'S KNOWN WISHES
IT WAS A MUCH SAFER PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN IN HIS PREDICAMENT
WE MUST BE SERIOUS AND DECIDED
AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER THAN BECAUSE ELIZABETH DESERVED IT SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION
WHILE MISTER ELLIOT STEPPED TO LADY DALRYMPLE TO REQUEST HER ASSISTANCE HE SOON JOINED THEM AGAIN SUCCESSFUL OF COURSE LADY DALRYMPLE WOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO TAKE THEM HOME AND WOULD CALL FOR THEM IN A FEW MINUTES
HAD BEEN TAKING MUCH PAINS TO SEEK THE ACQUAINTANCE AND PROCLAIM THE VALUE OF THE CONNECTION AS HE HAD FORMERLY TAKEN PAINS TO SHEW NEGLECT THIS WAS VERY WONDERFUL IF IT WERE TRUE AND LADY RUSSELL WAS IN A STATE OF VERY AGREEABLE CURIOSITY AND PERPLEXITY ABOUT MISTER ELLIOT
SAID MISSUS MUSGROVE IN HER POWERFUL WHISPER THOUGH WE COULD HAVE WISHED IT DIFFERENT YET ALTOGETHER WE DID NOT THINK IT FAIR TO STAND OUT ANY LONGER FOR CHARLES HAYTER WAS QUITE WILD ABOUT IT AND HENRIETTA WAS PRETTY NEAR AS BAD
AND HE WAS NOW QUITE A DIFFERENT CREATURE FROM WHAT HE HAD BEEN THE FIRST WEEK HE HAD NOT SEEN LOUISA AND WAS SO EXTREMELY FEARFUL OF ANY ILL CONSEQUENCE TO HER FROM AN INTERVIEW THAT HE DID NOT PRESS FOR IT AT ALL
OF HIS BEING A MAN WHOM SHE HAD NO WISH TO SEE SHE HAD A GREAT WISH TO SEE HIM
LONDON BATH OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY ALL ANNE'S WISHES HAD BEEN FOR THE LATTER A SMALL HOUSE IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE THEY MIGHT STILL HAVE LADY RUSSELL'S SOCIETY STILL BE NEAR MARY
BRINGING WITH THEM MISSUS HARVILLE'S LITTLE CHILDREN TO IMPROVE THE NOISE OF UPPERCROSS AND LESSEN THAT OF LYME HENRIETTA REMAINED WITH LOUISA BUT ALL THE REST OF THE FAMILY WERE AGAIN IN THEIR USUAL QUARTERS LADY RUSSELL AND ANNE PAID THEIR COMPLIMENTS TO THEM ONCE
AND THEY HAD JUST REACHED THIS POINT WHEN ANNE AS SHE SAT NEAR THE WINDOW DESCRIED MOST DECIDEDLY AND DISTINCTLY CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WALKING DOWN THE STREET HER START WAS PERCEPTIBLE ONLY TO HERSELF
A SOMETHING BETWEEN DELIGHT AND MISERY HE SPOKE TO HER AND THEN TURNED AWAY THE CHARACTER OF HIS MANNER WAS EMBARRASSMENT SHE COULD NOT HAVE CALLED IT EITHER COLD OR FRIENDLY OR ANYTHING SO CERTAINLY AS EMBARRASSED
THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HAVING HAD NO FALL COULD PART WITH HER CHEERFULLY AND DEPEND ON FINDING HER BETTER AT NIGHT ANXIOUS TO OMIT NO POSSIBLE PRECAUTION ANNE STRUGGLED AND SAID I AM AFRAID MA'AM
AND WHO WAS PERFECTLY PERSUADED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE WITHOUT A CHANGE OF ABODE SINCE THE IDEA HAD BEEN STARTED IN THE VERY QUARTER WHICH OUGHT TO DICTATE HE HAD NO SCRUPLE HE SAID IN CONFESSING HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE
AND SO WE THOUGHT THEY HAD BETTER MARRY AT ONCE AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT AS MANY OTHERS HAVE DONE BEFORE THEM AT ANY RATE SAID I IT WILL BE BETTER THAN A LONG ENGAGEMENT THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I WAS GOING TO OBSERVE CRIED MISSUS CROFT
AND ANCIENT DIGNITY TO SUPPORT IN ANY OTHER PLACE SIR WALTER MIGHT JUDGE FOR HIMSELF AND WOULD BE LOOKED UP TO AS REGULATING THE MODES OF LIFE IN WHATEVER WAY HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT
WOULD BE HARDLY LESS PAINFUL THAN OF BOTH AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST OF LADY RUSSELL'S TOO GENTLE REDUCTIONS HOW ANNE'S MORE RIGID REQUISITIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE LADY RUSSELL'S HAD NO SUCCESS AT ALL
OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY
HER KNOWLEDGE OF HER FATHER AND ELIZABETH INCLINED HER TO THINK THAT THE SACRIFICE OF ONE PAIR OF HORSES WOULD BE HARDLY LESS PAINFUL THAN OF BOTH AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST OF LADY RUSSELL'S TOO GENTLE REDUCTIONS
AND IT WAS ONLY ON THE SUPPOSITION OF HIS BEING SPONTANEOUSLY SOLICITED BY SOME MOST UNEXCEPTIONABLE APPLICANT ON HIS OWN TERMS AND AS A GREAT FAVOUR THAT HE WOULD LET IT AT ALL HOW QUICK COME THE REASONS FOR APPROVING WHAT WE LIKE
ONLY OF SUCH MEN AS HAVE HEARTS PRESSING HIS OWN WITH EMOTION OH CRIED ANNE EAGERLY I HOPE I DO JUSTICE TO ALL THAT IS FELT BY YOU AND BY THOSE WHO RESEMBLE YOU
I CAN LISTEN NO LONGER IN SILENCE I MUST SPEAK TO YOU BY SUCH MEANS AS ARE WITHIN MY REACH YOU PIERCE MY SOUL I AM HALF AGONY HALF HOPE TELL ME NOT THAT I AM TOO LATE THAT SUCH PRECIOUS FEELINGS ARE GONE FOR EVER
RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER THAN BECAUSE ELIZABETH DESERVED IT SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION
AND SHE HAD BATHED AND SHE HAD GONE TO CHURCH AND THERE WERE A GREAT MANY MORE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT IN THE CHURCH AT LYME THAN AT UPPERCROSS AND ALL THIS JOINED TO THE SENSE OF BEING SO VERY USEFUL HAD MADE REALLY AN AGREEABLE FORTNIGHT ANNE ENQUIRED AFTER CAPTAIN BENWICK
AND I HAVE NOW THE CHARGE OF GETTING IT PROPERLY SET FOR ANOTHER IT WAS A COMMISSION TO ME BUT WHO ELSE WAS THERE TO EMPLOY I HOPE I CAN ALLOW FOR HIM I AM NOT SORRY INDEED TO MAKE IT OVER TO ANOTHER
AND STILL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES SEEING THE LAWNS AND GROVES OF KELLYNCH WAS THE OBJECT OF HER AMBITION BUT THE USUAL FATE OF ANNE ATTENDED HER IN HAVING SOMETHING VERY OPPOSITE FROM HER INCLINATION FIXED ON SHE DISLIKED BATH AND DID NOT THINK IT AGREED WITH HER
AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT THE LADIES OF CAPTAIN WENTWORTH'S PARTY BEGAN TALKING OF THEM MISTER ELLIOT DOES NOT DISLIKE HIS COUSIN I FANCY OH NO THAT IS CLEAR ENOUGH ONE CAN GUESS WHAT WILL HAPPEN THERE HE IS ALWAYS WITH THEM HALF LIVES IN THE FAMILY I BELIEVE
AND THE UNAFFECTED EASY KINDNESS OF MANNER WHICH DENOTED THE FEELINGS OF AN OLDER ACQUAINTANCE THAN HE REALLY WAS STRONGLY ENFORCED THE INVITATION SHE ROUSED HERSELF AND WENT TO HIM THE WINDOW AT WHICH HE STOOD
FELT THEIR PROGRESS THROUGH THE STREETS TO BE HOWEVER DISAGREEABLE YET TOO RAPID FOR WHO WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER WHEN SHE ARRIVED AND LOOKED BACK WITH FOND REGRET TO THE BUSTLES OF UPPERCROSS AND THE SECLUSION OF KELLYNCH
HERSELF THE WIDOW OF ONLY A KNIGHT SHE GAVE THE DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE AND SIR WALTER INDEPENDENT OF HIS CLAIMS AS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AN ATTENTIVE NEIGHBOUR AN OBLIGING LANDLORD THE HUSBAND OF HER VERY DEAR FRIEND THE FATHER OF ANNE AND HER SISTERS
SHE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN THE WORDS WHEN MISTER ELLIOT WALKED IN CAPTAIN WENTWORTH RECOLLECTED HIM PERFECTLY THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND THE MAN WHO HAD STOOD ON THE STEPS AT LYME ADMIRING ANNE AS SHE PASSED EXCEPT IN THE AIR AND LOOK AND MANNER OF THE PRIVILEGED RELATION AND FRIEND
THERE WAS NO PREVENTING HIM THIS WAS ALMOST CRUEL BUT SHE COULD NOT BE LONG UNGRATEFUL HE WAS SACRIFICING AN ENGAGEMENT AT A GUNSMITH'S TO BE OF USE TO HER AND SHE SET OFF WITH HIM WITH NO FEELING BUT GRATITUDE APPARENT
MUST LIVE ANOTHER DAY SHE COULD NOT KEEP HER APPOINTMENT PUNCTUALLY HOWEVER THE WEATHER WAS UNFAVOURABLE AND SHE HAD GRIEVED OVER THE RAIN ON HER FRIENDS ACCOUNT AND FELT IT VERY MUCH ON HER OWN BEFORE SHE WAS ABLE TO ATTEMPT THE WALK
SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING SHE CONSULTED ANNE WHO NEVER SEEMED CONSIDERED BY THE OTHERS AS HAVING ANY INTEREST IN THE QUESTION SHE CONSULTED AND IN A DEGREE WAS INFLUENCED BY HER
BUT ENOUGH TO MAKE SHELTER DESIRABLE FOR WOMEN AND QUITE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT VERY DESIRABLE FOR MISS ELLIOT TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING CONVEYED HOME IN LADY DALRYMPLE'S CARRIAGE WHICH WAS SEEN WAITING AT A LITTLE DISTANCE SHE ANNE AND MISSUS CLAY THEREFORE TURNED INTO MOLLAND'S
SHE WAS YET PERFECTLY CONSCIOUS OF LADY RUSSELL'S EYES BEING TURNED EXACTLY IN THE DIRECTION FOR HIM OF HER BEING IN SHORT INTENTLY OBSERVING HIM SHE COULD THOROUGHLY COMPREHEND THE SORT OF FASCINATION HE MUST POSSESS OVER LADY RUSSELL'S MIND
HE HAD BEEN ALSO ADDRESSING HER ON THE CONTENTS OF THAT LETTER DEPENDED ALL WHICH THIS WORLD COULD DO FOR HER ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE ANYTHING MIGHT BE DEFIED RATHER THAN SUSPENSE MISSUS MUSGROVE HAD LITTLE ARRANGEMENTS OF HER OWN AT HER OWN TABLE
ELIZABETH'S LAST LETTER HAD COMMUNICATED A PIECE OF NEWS OF SOME INTEREST MISTER ELLIOT WAS IN BATH HE HAD CALLED IN CAMDEN PLACE HAD CALLED A SECOND TIME A THIRD HAD BEEN POINTEDLY ATTENTIVE IF ELIZABETH AND HER FATHER DID NOT DECEIVE THEMSELVES
AND ENFORCE THEM WITH SUCH EXAMPLES OF THE ILL EFFECT OF A CONTRARY PRACTICE AS HAD FALLEN WITHIN THEIR OBSERVATION BUT ANNE HEARD NOTHING DISTINCTLY IT WAS ONLY A BUZZ OF WORDS IN HER EAR HER MIND WAS IN CONFUSION
WHICH HAD BEEN HAPPILY ENGRAFTED ON THE BEGINNING HE WAS NOT ONLY TO QUIT HIS HOME BUT TO SEE IT IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS A TRIAL OF FORTITUDE WHICH STRONGER HEADS THAN SIR WALTER'S HAVE FOUND TOO MUCH KELLYNCH HALL WAS TO BE LET THIS HOWEVER
THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT THERE HAD BEEN THREE ALTERNATIVES LONDON BATH OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY ALL ANNE'S WISHES HAD BEEN FOR THE LATTER A SMALL HOUSE IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
HE LOOKED VERY WELL NOT AS IF HE HAD BEEN SUFFERING IN HEALTH OR SPIRITS AND HE TALKED OF UPPERCROSS OF THE MUSGROVES NAY EVEN OF LOUISA AND HAD EVEN A MOMENTARY LOOK OF HIS OWN ARCH SIGNIFICANCE AS HE NAMED HER BUT YET IT WAS CAPTAIN WENTWORTH NOT COMFORTABLE
MISSUS MUSGROVE WAS GIVING MISSUS CROFT THE HISTORY OF HER ELDEST DAUGHTER'S ENGAGEMENT AND JUST IN THAT INCONVENIENT TONE OF VOICE WHICH WAS PERFECTLY AUDIBLE
HE HAD NO SCRUPLE HE SAID IN CONFESSING HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT SIR WALTER COULD MATERIALLY ALTER HIS STYLE OF LIVING IN A HOUSE WHICH HAD SUCH A CHARACTER OF HOSPITALITY AND ANCIENT DIGNITY TO SUPPORT
BUT THE OBJECT OF DISTANT CIVILITY FROM SITUATION MISSUS CLAY WAS IN LADY RUSSELL'S ESTIMATE
WAS A PROFOUND SECRET NOT TO BE BREATHED BEYOND THEIR OWN CIRCLE SIR WALTER COULD NOT HAVE BORNE THE DEGRADATION OF BEING KNOWN TO DESIGN LETTING HIS HOUSE MISTER SHEPHERD HAD ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD ADVERTISE BUT NEVER DARED APPROACH IT AGAIN
FLOWS DEEP AND LONG OAK BELONGED TO THE EVEN TEMPERED ORDER OF HUMANITY AND FELT THE SECRET FUSION OF HIMSELF IN BATHSHEBA TO BE BURNING WITH A FINER FLAME NOW THAT SHE WAS GONE THAT WAS ALL
HAD THEY BEEN EXHIBITED WITH DUE CONSIDERATION BUT THERE IS A WAY SOME MEN HAVE RURAL AND URBAN ALIKE FOR WHICH THE MIND IS MORE RESPONSIBLE THAN FLESH AND SINEW IT IS A WAY OF CURTAILING THEIR DIMENSIONS BY THEIR MANNER OF SHOWING THEM
AS IF YOU WERE HEDGING SO THREE AS IF YOU WERE REAPING SO FOUR AS IF YOU WERE THRESHING IN THAT WAY THEN THE SAME ON THE LEFT THE THRUSTS ARE THESE ONE TWO THREE FOUR RIGHT
EXTENDED ITSELF AND JUMPED HIGH INTO THE AIR THE LEAP WAS AN ASTONISHING ONE THE EWE FELL HEAVILY AND LAY STILL BATHSHEBA WENT UP TO IT THE SHEEP WAS DEAD OH WHAT SHALL I DO WHAT SHALL I DO SHE AGAIN EXCLAIMED WRINGING HER HANDS
AND THE WEARISOME SERIES HAD TO BE REPEATED IN REVERSE ORDER WHITEPITS SPRINGMEAD CAPPEL'S PIECE THE FLATS MIDDLE FIELD SHEEPLANDS SIXTEEN ACRES
AFTER WELL NIGH EXHAUSTING HIMSELF IN ATTEMPTS TO GET BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE COVE IN HIS WEAKNESS SWIMMING SEVERAL INCHES DEEPER THAN WAS HIS WONT
TILL HE COULD DISCERN THE HOUR MARKED BY THE GREEN FACED TIMEKEEPERS WITHIN IT MAY BE MENTIONED THAT OAK'S FOB BEING DIFFICULT OF ACCESS BY REASON OF ITS SOMEWHAT HIGH SITUATION IN THE WAISTBAND OF HIS TROUSERS WHICH ALSO LAY AT A REMOTE HEIGHT UNDER HIS WAISTCOAT
IS A CHRONIC SOUND THAT ONLY MAKES ITSELF NOTICED BY CEASING OR ALTERING IN SOME UNUSUAL MANNER FROM THE WELL KNOWN IDLE TWINKLE WHICH SIGNIFIES TO THE ACCUSTOMED EAR HOWEVER DISTANT THAT ALL IS WELL IN THE FOLD
THAT HE WATCHED BOLDWOOD'S MANNER HE SNIPPED THE SHEEP IN THE GROIN THE ANIMAL PLUNGED BATHSHEBA INSTANTLY GAZED TOWARDS IT AND SAW THE BLOOD OH GABRIEL SHE EXCLAIMED WITH SEVERE REMONSTRANCE
THE MISTY CHESTNUT WORK OF THE RAFTERS REFERRED TO NO EXPLODED FORTIFYING ART OR WORN OUT RELIGIOUS CREED THE DEFENCE AND SALVATION OF THE BODY BY DAILY BREAD IS STILL A STUDY A RELIGION AND A DESIRE
THE HANDSOME GIRL WAITED FOR SOME TIME IDLY IN HER PLACE AND THE ONLY SOUND HEARD IN THE STILLNESS WAS THE HOPPING OF THE CANARY UP AND DOWN THE PERCHES OF ITS PRISON THEN SHE LOOKED ATTENTIVELY DOWNWARDS
SO MUCH AS A PRELIMINARY WELL NEXT OUR CUT ONE IS AS IF YOU WERE SOWING YOUR CORN SO BATHSHEBA SAW A SORT OF RAINBOW UPSIDE DOWN IN THE AIR AND TROY'S ARM WAS STILL AGAIN CUT TWO
IN WHICH THREE OR FOUR SHEEP WERE CONTINUOUSLY KEPT READY FOR THE SHEARERS TO SEIZE WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME IN THE BACKGROUND MELLOWED BY TAWNY SHADE WERE THE THREE WOMEN MARYANN MONEY AND TEMPERANCE AND SOBERNESS MILLER
WELL SAID BATHSHEBA UNWILLING TO BELIEVE THAT HER VERBAL LETTRE DE CACHET COULD POSSIBLY HAVE MISCARRIED HE SAYS BEGGARS MUSTN'T BE CHOOSERS REPLIED LABAN WHAT SAID THE YOUNG FARMER OPENING HER EYES AND DRAWING IN HER BREATH FOR AN OUTBURST
THEN ADDED THESE WORDS AT THE BOTTOM DO NOT DESERT ME GABRIEL SHE LOOKED A LITTLE REDDER IN REFOLDING IT AND CLOSED HER LIPS AS IF THEREBY TO SUSPEND TILL TOO LATE THE ACTION OF CONSCIENCE IN EXAMINING WHETHER SUCH STRATEGY WERE JUSTIFIABLE
OAK RAISED HIS HEAD AND WONDERING WHAT HE COULD DO LISTLESSLY SURVEYED THE SCENE BY THE OUTER MARGIN OF THE PIT WAS AN OVAL POND AND OVER IT HUNG THE ATTENUATED SKELETON OF A CHROME YELLOW MOON WHICH HAD ONLY A FEW DAYS TO LAST
WHENCE SHE CAST A FAREWELL GLANCE UPON THE SPOT SHE HAD JUST LEFT HAVING RESOLVED NOT TO REMAIN NEAR THE PLACE AFTER ALL SHE SAW A DIM SPOT OF ARTIFICIAL RED MOVING ROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE RISE
BUT I DIDN'T PUT IT SO PLAIN THAT SHE COULD UNDERSTAND MY MEANING SO I COULD LAY IT ON ALL THE STRONGER THAT WAS MY DEPTH HOWEVER LET HER MARRY AN SHE WILL PERHAPS TIS HIGH TIME I BELIEVE FARMER BOLDWOOD KISSED HER BEHIND THE SPEAR BED AT THE SHEEP WASHING T'OTHER DAY THAT I DO
SO AS TO FOLLOW ON AT THE FLOCK WHEN THE OTHER SHOULD DIE BUT HAD GOT NO FURTHER THAN THE RUDIMENTS AS YET STILL FINDING AN INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTY IN DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN DOING A THING WELL ENOUGH AND DOING IT TOO WELL
TO DAY THE LARGE SIDE DOORS WERE THROWN OPEN TOWARDS THE SUN TO ADMIT A BOUNTIFUL LIGHT TO THE IMMEDIATE SPOT OF THE SHEARERS OPERATIONS WHICH WAS THE WOOD THRESHING FLOOR IN THE CENTRE FORMED OF THICK OAK BLACK WITH AGE AND POLISHED BY THE BEATING OF FLAILS FOR MANY GENERATIONS
STRETCHED THE WHOLE WIDTH OF HIS FRONT AND ROUND TO THE RIGHT WHERE NEAR THE TOWN AND PORT OF BUDMOUTH THE SUN BRISTLED DOWN UPON IT
EITHER OF DISTINCTION OR NOTORIETY THE RED JACKETED AND DARK HAIRED MAIDEN SEEMED TO THINK SO TOO FOR SHE CARELESSLY GLANCED OVER HIM AND TOLD HER MAN TO DRIVE ON
AN ANGULARITY OF LINEAMENT AND A FIXITY OF FACIAL MACHINERY IN GENERAL PROCLAIMED THAT SERIOUS WORK WAS THE ORDER OF THE DAY THEY SHEARED IN THE GREAT BARN CALLED FOR THE NONCE THE SHEARING BARN WHICH ON GROUND PLAN RESEMBLED A CHURCH WITH TRANSEPTS
HE UNDRESSED AND PLUNGED IN INSIDE THE COVE THE WATER WAS UNINTERESTING TO A SWIMMER BEING SMOOTH AS A POND AND TO GET A LITTLE OF THE OCEAN SWELL
TROY RESOLVED AS A LAST RESOURCE TO TREAD WATER AT A SLIGHT INCLINE AND SO ENDEAVOUR TO REACH THE SHORE AT ANY POINT MERELY GIVING HIMSELF A GENTLE IMPETUS INWARDS WHILST
AND BATHSHEBA APPEARED IN THEIR MIDST THEIR SOFT FEATHERY ARMS CARESSING HER UP TO HER SHOULDERS SHE PAUSED TURNED WENT BACK OVER THE HILL AND HALF WAY TO HER OWN DOOR
SHE BLUSHES AT THE INSULT MURMURED BATHSHEBA WATCHING THE PINK FLUSH WHICH AROSE AND OVERSPREAD THE NECK AND SHOULDERS OF THE EWE WHERE THEY WERE LEFT BARE BY THE CLICKING SHEARS A FLUSH WHICH WAS ENVIABLE FOR ITS DELICACY BY MANY QUEENS OF COTERIES
HOW LONG MISS SAID GABRIEL WIPING HIS BROW THREE AND TWENTY MINUTES AND A HALF SINCE YOU TOOK THE FIRST LOCK FROM ITS FOREHEAD
BUT TWOPENCE HERE HE SAID STEPPING FORWARD AND HANDING TWOPENCE TO THE GATEKEEPER LET THE YOUNG WOMAN PASS HE LOOKED UP AT HER THEN SHE HEARD HIS WORDS AND LOOKED DOWN
THE RIDER NEARED THEM IT WAS TALL OH WHAT FOLLY SAID BATHSHEBA GABRIEL WAS NOT VISIBLE ANYWHERE PERHAPS HE IS ALREADY GONE SHE SAID TALL CAME INTO THE INCLOSURE AND LEAPT OFF HIS FACE TRAGIC AS MORTON'S AFTER THE BATTLE OF SHREWSBURY
HE DREW NEAR AND SAID I MUST BE LEAVING YOU HE DREW NEARER STILL A MINUTE LATER AND SHE SAW HIS SCARLET FORM DISAPPEAR AMID THE FERNY THICKET ALMOST IN A FLASH LIKE A BRAND SWIFTLY WAVED
COVERING HER HEAD WITH HIS KNEE GRADUALLY RUNNING THE SHEARS LINE AFTER LINE ROUND HER DEWLAP THENCE ABOUT HER FLANK AND BACK AND FINISHING OVER THE TAIL WELL DONE AND DONE QUICKLY SAID BATHSHEBA LOOKING AT HER WATCH AS THE LAST SNIP RESOUNDED
BATHSHEBA'S BEAUTY BELONGING RATHER TO THE DEMONIAN THAN TO THE ANGELIC SCHOOL SHE NEVER LOOKED SO WELL AS WHEN SHE WAS ANGRY
AND DESCENDING INTO THE ROAD FOLLOWED THE VEHICLE TO THE TURNPIKE GATE SOME WAY BEYOND THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL WHERE THE OBJECT OF HIS CONTEMPLATION NOW HALTED FOR THE PAYMENT OF TOLL ABOUT TWENTY STEPS STILL REMAINED BETWEEN HIM AND THE GATE WHEN HE HEARD A DISPUTE
JOSEPH POORGRASS RETIRED A FEW STEPS BEHIND A HURDLE HE SAYS HE SHALL NOT COME ONLESS YOU REQUEST EN TO COME CIVILLY AND IN A PROPER MANNER AS BECOMES
THE SPACE LEFT UNTOUCHED WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST A MOULD OF BATHSHEBA'S FIGURE BEHIND THE LUMINOUS STREAMS OF THIS AURORA MILITARIS
AND WITH ONLY A HALTER BY WAY OF REIN HE DIMINISHED DOWN THE HILL BATHSHEBA WATCHED SO DID ALL THE REST TALL CANTERED ALONG THE BRIDLE PATH THROUGH SIXTEEN ACRES SHEEPLANDS MIDDLE FIELD THE FLATS
MEN THIN AWAY TO INSIGNIFICANCE AND OBLIVION QUITE AS OFTEN BY NOT MAKING THE MOST OF GOOD SPIRITS WHEN THEY HAVE THEM AS BY LACKING GOOD SPIRITS WHEN THEY ARE INDISPENSABLE GABRIEL LATELY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS PROSTRATION BY MISFORTUNE
AND WILL ALL DIE AS DEAD AS NITS IF THEY BAIN'T GOT OUT AND CURED SAID TALL JOSEPH'S COUNTENANCE WAS DRAWN INTO LINES AND PUCKERS BY HIS CONCERN
SHE WENT OUT WHEN THE HORSE WAS HEARD AND LOOKED UP A MOUNTED FIGURE PASSED BETWEEN HER AND THE SKY AND DREW ON TOWARDS THE FIELD OF SHEEP THE RIDER TURNING HIS FACE IN RECEDING GABRIEL LOOKED AT HER
HE DID IT SO THOROUGHLY THAT HE WOULD HAVE CHASED THEM ACROSS THE WHOLE COUNTY WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE IF NOT CALLED OFF OR REMINDED WHEN TO STOP BY THE EXAMPLE OF OLD GEORGE THUS MUCH FOR THE DOGS ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF NORCOMBE HILL WAS A CHALK PIT
WITHOUT ANY IDEA OF WHO IT WAS TO BE IN A MINUTE THEY HAD VANISHED THROUGH THE GATE AND SHE STOOD ALONE WITH THE DYING FLOCK NEVER WILL I SEND FOR HIM NEVER SHE SAID FIRMLY ONE OF THE EWES HERE CONTRACTED ITS MUSCLES HORRIBLY
HE WAS INWARDLY CONVINCED THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ANTICIPATIONS OF HIS EASY GOING AND WORSE EDUCATED COMRADES THAT DAY WOULD SEE BOLDWOOD THE ACCEPTED HUSBAND OF MISS EVERDENE
I WOULDN'T CRY ABOUT IT MISS SAID WILLIAM SMALLBURY COMPASSIONATELY WHY NOT ASK HIM SOFTER LIKE I'M SURE HE'D COME THEN GABLE IS A TRUE MAN IN THAT WAY BATHSHEBA CHECKED HER GRIEF AND WIPED HER EYES
HE HAD FLUNG OFF HIS COAT ROLLED UP HIS SHIRT SLEEVES AND TAKEN FROM HIS POCKET THE INSTRUMENT OF SALVATION IT WAS A SMALL TUBE OR TROCHAR WITH A LANCE PASSING DOWN THE INSIDE AND GABRIEL BEGAN TO USE IT WITH A DEXTERITY THAT WOULD HAVE GRACED A HOSPITAL SURGEON
AND THE NEXT THING OF WHICH SHE WAS CONSCIOUS WAS THAT THE POINT AND BLADE OF THE SWORD WERE DARTING WITH A GLEAM TOWARDS HER LEFT SIDE JUST ABOVE HER HIP THEN OF THEIR REAPPEARANCE ON HER RIGHT SIDE EMERGING AS IT WERE FROM BETWEEN HER RIBS HAVING APPARENTLY PASSED THROUGH HER BODY
EXPERIENCED FOR MANY A DAY AND YEAR BEFORE THE AIR WAS WARM AND MUGGY AND THE TOP SEEMED TO RECEDE AS HE APPROACHED AT LAST HE REACHED THE SUMMIT AND A WIDE AND NOVEL PROSPECT
SHEEP HAVE BROKE FENCE SAID FRAY AND GOT INTO A FIELD OF YOUNG CLOVER SAID TALL YOUNG CLOVER SAID MOON CLOVER SAID JOSEPH POORGRASS AND THEY BE GETTING BLASTED SAID HENERY FRAY THAT THEY BE SAID JOSEPH
AND A COAT LIKE DOCTOR JOHNSON'S HIS LOWER EXTREMITIES BEING ENCASED IN ORDINARY LEATHER LEGGINGS AND BOOTS EMPHATICALLY LARGE AFFORDING TO EACH FOOT A ROOMY APARTMENT SO CONSTRUCTED THAT ANY WEARER MIGHT STAND IN A RIVER ALL DAY LONG AND KNOW NOTHING OF DAMP
BOLDWOOD ALWAYS CARRIED WITH HIM A SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE OF HIS OWN WHICH EVERYBODY FELT WHO CAME NEAR HIM AND THE TALK WHICH BATHSHEBA'S PRESENCE HAD SOMEWHAT SUPPRESSED WAS NOW TOTALLY SUSPENDED
THE PICTURE WAS A DELICATE ONE WOMAN'S PRESCRIPTIVE INFIRMITY HAD STALKED INTO THE SUNLIGHT WHICH HAD CLOTHED IT IN THE FRESHNESS OF AN ORIGINALITY A CYNICAL INFERENCE WAS IRRESISTIBLE BY GABRIEL OAK AS HE REGARDED THE SCENE
DARK AND MOTIONLESS AS NAPOLEON AT SAINT HELENA A HORRIBLE CONVICTION DARTED THROUGH OAK WITH A SENSATION OF BODILY FAINTNESS HE ADVANCED AT ONE POINT THE RAILS WERE BROKEN THROUGH AND THERE HE SAW THE FOOTPRINTS OF HIS EWES
AND THE WHOLE SERIES OF ACTIONS WAS SO IDLY PUT FORTH AS TO MAKE IT RASH TO ASSERT THAT INTENTION HAD ANY PART IN THEM AT ALL THE WAGGONER'S STEPS WERE HEARD RETURNING
AND BEHIND ALL TROY HIMSELF MOSTLY FACING HER SOMETIMES TO SHOW THE REAR CUTS HALF TURNED AWAY HIS EYE NEVERTHELESS ALWAYS KEENLY MEASURING HER BREADTH AND OUTLINE
NO YOU HAVE NOT WHATEVER HAVE YOU DONE I HAVE NOT TOUCHED YOU SAID TROY QUIETLY IT WAS MERE SLEIGHT OF HAND THE SWORD PASSED BEHIND YOU NOW YOU ARE NOT AFRAID ARE YOU BECAUSE IF YOU ARE I CAN'T PERFORM
SAID THE WAGGONER THEN I HEARD IT FALL SAID THE GIRL IN A SOFT THOUGH NOT PARTICULARLY LOW VOICE I HEARD A NOISE I COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR WHEN WE WERE COMING UP THE HILL
BUT THE GREY AFTER YEARS OF SUN AND RAIN HAD BEEN SCORCHED AND WASHED OUT OF THE MORE PROMINENT LOCKS
AND ON WORKING DAYS HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF SOUND JUDGMENT EASY MOTIONS PROPER DRESS AND GENERAL GOOD CHARACTER ON SUNDAYS HE WAS A MAN OF MISTY VIEWS RATHER GIVEN TO POSTPONING AND HAMPERED BY HIS BEST CLOTHES AND UMBRELLA
THE SMALLER OF ITS HANDS TOO OCCASIONALLY SLIPPED ROUND ON THE PIVOT AND THUS THOUGH THE MINUTES WERE TOLD WITH PRECISION NOBODY COULD BE QUITE CERTAIN OF THE HOUR THEY BELONGED TO THE STOPPING PECULIARITY OF HIS WATCH OAK REMEDIED BY THUMPS AND SHAKES
AND CEASING IN A MOMENT FROM THE CLOSE COMPRESSION OF HER TWO RED LIPS WITH WHICH SHE HAD ACCOMPANIED THE EXERTION OF PULLING ON A TIGHT GLOVE SIXTY SAID JOSEPH POORGRASS SEVENTY SAID MOON FIFTY NINE SAID SUSAN TALL'S HUSBAND
A MOVING OBJECT BROKE THE OUTLINE OF THE EXTREMITY AND IMMEDIATELY A SHIP'S BOAT APPEARED MANNED WITH SEVERAL SAILOR LADS HER BOWS TOWARDS THE SEA
THE DOG CAME UP LICKED HIS HAND AND MADE SIGNS IMPLYING THAT HE EXPECTED SOME GREAT REWARD FOR SIGNAL SERVICES RENDERED OAK LOOKED OVER THE PRECIPICE
AS HE PUT DOWN THE LUNCHEON TO DRAG A FRIGHTENED EWE TO HIS SHEAR STATION FLINGING IT OVER UPON ITS BACK WITH A DEXTEROUS TWIST OF THE ARM HE LOPPED OFF THE TRESSES ABOUT ITS HEAD AND OPENED UP THE NECK AND COLLAR HIS MISTRESS QUIETLY LOOKING ON
WE WORKFOLK SHALL HAVE SOME LORDLY JUNKETING TO NIGHT SAID CAINY BALL CASTING FORTH HIS THOUGHTS IN A NEW DIRECTION THIS MORNING I SEE EM MAKING THE GREAT PUDDENS IN THE MILKING PAILS LUMPS OF FAT AS BIG AS YER THUMB MISTER OAK
WHO WERE ALONE ITS SPECTATORS WHETHER THE SMILE BEGAN AS A FACTITIOUS ONE TO TEST HER CAPACITY IN THAT ART NOBODY KNOWS IT ENDED CERTAINLY IN A REAL SMILE SHE BLUSHED AT HERSELF AND SEEING HER REFLECTION BLUSH BLUSHED THE MORE
HAVING ONCE RECEIVED THE STIMULUS THAT HER PRESENCE ALWAYS GAVE THEM THEY WENT ROUND AMONG THE SHEEP WITH A WILL THE MAJORITY OF THE AFFLICTED ANIMALS WERE LYING DOWN AND COULD NOT BE STIRRED THESE WERE BODILY LIFTED OUT AND THE OTHERS DRIVEN INTO THE ADJOINING FIELD
THROWS THE LOOSE LOCKS INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FLEECE ROLLS IT UP AND CARRIES IT INTO THE BACKGROUND AS THREE AND A HALF POUNDS OF UNADULTERATED WARMTH FOR THE WINTER ENJOYMENT OF PERSONS UNKNOWN AND FAR AWAY WHO WILL HOWEVER NEVER EXPERIENCE THE SUPERLATIVE COMFORT DERIVABLE
CAPPEL'S PIECE SHRANK ALMOST TO A POINT CROSSED THE BRIDGE AND ASCENDED FROM THE VALLEY THROUGH SPRINGMEAD AND WHITEPITS ON THE OTHER SIDE
IN THE SOLEMN CALM OF THE AWAKENING MORN THAT NOTE WAS HEARD BY GABRIEL BEATING WITH UNUSUAL VIOLENCE AND RAPIDITY THIS EXCEPTIONAL RINGING MAY BE CAUSED IN TWO WAYS
JOSEPH POORGRASS THE SIXTH YOUNG CAIN BALL AS ASSISTANT SHEARER AND GABRIEL OAK AS GENERAL SUPERVISOR NONE OF THESE WERE CLOTHED TO ANY EXTENT WORTH MENTIONING EACH APPEARING TO HAVE HIT IN THE MATTER OF RAIMENT THE DECENT MEAN BETWEEN A HIGH AND LOW CASTE HINDOO
OWING TO THE GREAT HURRY NECESSITATED BY THE FAR GONE STATE OF SOME OF THE FLOCK GABRIEL MISSED HIS AIM IN ONE CASE AND IN ONE ONLY STRIKING WIDE OF THE MARK
WHICH THREATENED TO BE INDELIBLE AND MADE LIFE IN BATHSHEBA'S HOUSE INTOLERABLE AT THREE IN THE AFTERNOON HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE FOOT OF A SLOPE MORE THAN A MILE IN LENGTH WHICH RAN TO THE RIDGE OF A RANGE OF HILLS LYING
PASSABLY WELL PUT YES AND I WOULD HAVE SAID IT HAD DEATH AND SALVATION OVERTOOK ME FOR IT SUCH IS MY SPIRIT WHEN I HAVE A MIND A TRUE MAN AND PROUD AS A LUCIFER YOU SEE THE ARTFULNESS WHY TWAS ABOUT BEING BAILY REALLY
MATTHEW'S JAWS SANK AND HIS EYES TURNED WHICHEVER WAY THE STRONGEST MUSCLE HAPPENED TO PULL THEM YES SAID JOSEPH AND I WAS SITTING AT HOME LOOKING FOR EPHESIANS AND SAYS I TO MYSELF TIS NOTHING BUT CORINTHIANS AND THESSALONIANS IN THIS DANGED TESTAMENT
AND DIVERGING WRINKLES APPEARED ROUND THEM EXTENDING UPON HIS COUNTENANCE LIKE THE RAYS IN A RUDIMENTARY SKETCH OF THE RISING SUN HIS CHRISTIAN NAME WAS GABRIEL
MANY BATHERS HAD THERE PRAYED FOR A DRY DEATH FROM TIME TO TIME AND LIKE GONZALO ALSO HAD BEEN UNANSWERED AND TROY BEGAN TO DEEM IT POSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT BE ADDED TO THEIR NUMBER
THE LESS ABSOLUTE ITS CHARACTER IT MAY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED THAT THERE IS NO REGULAR PATH FOR GETTING OUT OF LOVE AS THERE IS FOR GETTING IN SOME PEOPLE LOOK UPON MARRIAGE AS A SHORT CUT THAT WAY BUT IT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO FAIL SEPARATION
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN CREDITABLE FOR ITS PROMPTNESS TO ANY WOMAN IN THE WORLD POOR GABRIEL'S SOUL WAS FED WITH A LUXURY OF CONTENT BY HAVING HER OVER HIM HER EYES CRITICALLY REGARDING HIS SKILFUL SHEARS WHICH APPARENTLY WERE GOING TO GATHER UP A PIECE OF THE FLESH AT EVERY CLOSE AND YET NEVER DID SO
GABRIEL PERHAPS A LITTLE PIQUED BY THE COMELY TRAVELLER'S INDIFFERENCE GLANCED BACK TO WHERE HE HAD WITNESSED HER PERFORMANCE OVER THE HEDGE AND SAID
AND BY MAIN FORCE OF WORRYING HAD GIVEN THEM MOMENTUM ENOUGH TO BREAK DOWN A PORTION OF THE ROTTEN RAILING AND SO HURLED THEM OVER THE EDGE GEORGE'S SON HAD DONE HIS WORK SO THOROUGHLY THAT HE WAS CONSIDERED TOO GOOD A WORKMAN TO LIVE
IN WHICH MEN WOULD PLAY A PART VISTAS OF PROBABLE TRIUMPHS THE SMILES BEING OF A PHASE SUGGESTING THAT HEARTS WERE IMAGINED AS LOST AND WON STILL THIS WAS BUT CONJECTURE
NEVER SINCE THE BROADSWORD BECAME THE NATIONAL WEAPON HAD THERE BEEN MORE DEXTERITY SHOWN IN ITS MANAGEMENT THAN BY THE HANDS OF SERGEANT TROY AND NEVER HAD HE BEEN IN SUCH SPLENDID TEMPER FOR THE PERFORMANCE AS NOW IN THE EVENING SUNSHINE
I WON'T SEND FOR HIM NO I WON'T THE MOST VIGOROUS EXPRESSION OF A RESOLUTION DOES NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE WITH THE GREATEST VIGOUR OF THE RESOLUTION ITSELF IT IS OFTEN FLUNG OUT AS A SORT OF PROP TO SUPPORT A DECAYING CONVICTION WHICH WHILST STRONG
NOT A BOAT OF ANY KIND WAS AT PRESENT WITHIN SIGHT BUT FAR IN THE DISTANCE BUDMOUTH LAY UPON THE SEA AS IT WERE QUIETLY REGARDING HIS EFFORTS
ALL EMITTED IN THE MARVELLOUS EVOLUTIONS OF TROY'S REFLECTING BLADE WHICH SEEMED EVERYWHERE AT ONCE AND YET NOWHERE SPECIALLY THESE CIRCLING GLEAMS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A KEEN RUSH THAT WAS ALMOST A WHISTLING
THE CHANGE FROM THE CUSTOMARY SPOT AND NECESSARY OCCASION OF SUCH AN ACT FROM THE DRESSING HOUR IN A BEDROOM TO A TIME OF TRAVELLING OUT OF DOORS LENT TO THE IDLE DEED A NOVELTY IT DID NOT INTRINSICALLY POSSESS
FRAY'S FOREHEAD WAS WRINKLED BOTH PERPENDICULARLY AND CROSSWISE AFTER THE PATTERN OF A PORTCULLIS EXPRESSIVE OF A DOUBLE DESPAIR LABAN TALL'S LIPS WERE THIN AND HIS FACE WAS RIGID
HE CROSSED OVER TOWARDS BATHSHEBA WHO TURNED TO GREET HIM WITH A CARRIAGE OF PERFECT EASE HE SPOKE TO HER IN LOW TONES AND SHE INSTINCTIVELY MODULATED HER OWN TO THE SAME PITCH AND HER VOICE ULTIMATELY EVEN CAUGHT THE INFLECTION OF HIS
ALL TROY'S VIGOUR SPASMODICALLY REVIVED TO PROLONG THE STRUGGLE YET A LITTLE FURTHER SWIMMING WITH HIS RIGHT ARM HE HELD UP HIS LEFT TO HAIL THEM
NOW JUST TO LEARN WHETHER YOU HAVE PLUCK ENOUGH TO LET ME DO WHAT I WISH I'LL GIVE YOU A PRELIMINARY TEST HE FLOURISHED THE SWORD BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION NUMBER TWO
AND OF THE ANIMAL THE METAMORPHOSED FIGURES OF MISTER JAN COGGAN THE MASTER SHEARER THE SECOND AND THIRD SHEARERS WHO TRAVELLED IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR CALLING AND DO NOT REQUIRE DEFINITION BY NAME HENERY FRAY THE FOURTH SHEARER SUSAN TALL'S HUSBAND THE FIFTH
PASSING HIS HAND OVER THE SHEEP'S LEFT FLANK AND SELECTING THE PROPER POINT HE PUNCTURED THE SKIN AND RUMEN WITH THE LANCE AS IT STOOD IN THE TUBE THEN HE SUDDENLY WITHDREW THE LANCE RETAINING THE TUBE IN ITS PLACE
BUT SOME THOUGHTFUL PERSONS WHO HAD SEEN HIM WALKING ACROSS ONE OF HIS FIELDS ON A CERTAIN DECEMBER MORNING SUNNY AND EXCEEDINGLY MILD MIGHT HAVE REGARDED GABRIEL OAK IN OTHER ASPECTS THAN THESE
NOR SHALL YOU IF YOU STAY WITH ME AH SHE ADDED BRIGHTENING FARMER BOLDWOOD KNOWS
THE CLEAN SLEEK CREATURE AROSE FROM ITS FLEECE HOW PERFECTLY LIKE APHRODITE RISING FROM THE FOAM SHOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN TO BE REALIZED LOOKING STARTLED AND SHY AT THE LOSS OF ITS GARMENT WHICH LAY ON THE FLOOR IN ONE SOFT CLOUD UNITED THROUGHOUT
YOU ARE MY ANTAGONIST WITH THIS DIFFERENCE FROM REAL WARFARE THAT I SHALL MISS YOU EVERY TIME BY ONE HAIR'S BREADTH OR PERHAPS TWO MIND YOU DON'T FLINCH WHATEVER YOU DO I'LL BE SURE NOT TO SHE SAID INVINCIBLY
SO EARNEST AND YET SO WRONG HEADED WAS THIS YOUNG DOG HE HAD NO NAME IN PARTICULAR AND ANSWERED WITH PERFECT READINESS TO ANY PLEASANT INTERJECTION THAT IF SENT BEHIND THE FLOCK TO HELP THEM ON
AS USUAL WITH DECIDED CHARACTERS BATHSHEBA INVARIABLY PROVOKED THE CRITICISM OF INDIVIDUALS LIKE HENERY FRAY HER EMBLAZONED FAULT WAS TO BE TOO PRONOUNCED IN HER OBJECTIONS AND NOT SUFFICIENTLY OVERT IN HER LIKINGS
TWO OF THE SAILORS HAULED HIM IN OVER THE STERN THEY FORMED PART OF A BRIG'S CREW
AND SELECTING THE SHEEP FOR THEM AT THE PRESENT MOMENT HE WAS ENGAGED IN HANDING ROUND A MUG OF MILD LIQUOR SUPPLIED FROM A BARREL IN THE CORNER AND CUT PIECES OF BREAD AND CHEESE
WILL YOU STAY ON WITH ME SHE SAID SMILING WINNINGLY AND NOT TROUBLING TO BRING HER LIPS QUITE TOGETHER AGAIN AT THE END BECAUSE THERE WAS GOING TO BE ANOTHER SMILE SOON
SURROUNDED BY TABLES AND CHAIRS WITH THEIR LEGS UPWARDS BACKED BY AN OAK SETTLE AND ORNAMENTED IN FRONT BY POTS OF GERANIUMS MYRTLES AND CACTUSES TOGETHER WITH A CAGED CANARY
IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS A WATCH AS TO SHAPE AND INTENTION AND A SMALL CLOCK AS TO SIZE THIS INSTRUMENT BEING SEVERAL YEARS OLDER THAN OAK'S GRANDFATHER HAD THE PECULIARITY OF GOING EITHER TOO FAST OR NOT AT ALL
THE PIT WAS A SAUCER SHAPED CONCAVE NATURALLY FORMED WITH A TOP DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY FEET AND SHALLOW ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE SUNSHINE TO REACH THEIR HEADS STANDING IN THE CENTRE
THE SPRING TIDES WERE GOING BY WITHOUT FLOATING HIM OFF AND THE NEAP MIGHT SOON COME WHICH COULD NOT IT WAS THE FIRST DAY OF JUNE AND THE SHEEP SHEARING SEASON CULMINATED
FLOSSY CATKINS OF THE LATER KINDS FERN SPROUTS LIKE BISHOPS CROZIERS THE SQUARE HEADED MOSCHATEL THE ODD CUCKOO PINT
PARALLEL WITH THE SHORE AND FORMING A MONOTONOUS BARRIER BETWEEN THE BASIN OF CULTIVATED COUNTRY INLAND AND THE WILDER SCENERY OF THE COAST UP THE HILL STRETCHED A ROAD NEARLY STRAIGHT AND PERFECTLY WHITE
REQUIRED NO ENUNCIATION TO PROVE IT SO THE NO I WON'T OF BATHSHEBA MEANT VIRTUALLY I THINK I MUST SHE FOLLOWED HER ASSISTANTS THROUGH THE GATE AND LIFTED HER HAND TO ONE OF THEM LABAN ANSWERED TO HER SIGNAL WHERE IS OAK STAYING
NOT APPARENT IN ERECTIONS WHERE MORE ORNAMENT HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED THE DUSKY FILMED CHESTNUT ROOF BRACED AND TIED IN BY HUGE COLLARS CURVES AND DIAGONALS WAS FAR NOBLER IN DESIGN BECAUSE MORE WEALTHY IN MATERIAL THAN NINE TENTHS OF THOSE IN OUR MODERN CHURCHES
THERE THOSE ARE THE STEREOTYPED FORMS THE INFANTRY HAVE TWO MOST DIABOLICAL UPWARD CUTS WHICH WE ARE TOO HUMANE TO USE LIKE THIS THREE FOUR HOW MURDEROUS AND BLOODTHIRSTY
THOUGH OLD HE WAS CLEVER AND TRUSTWORTHY STILL THE YOUNG DOG GEORGE'S SON MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN THE IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER FOR THERE WAS NOT MUCH RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN HIM AND GEORGE HE WAS LEARNING THE SHEEP KEEPING BUSINESS
TO AN OUTSIDER THERE WAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF IN THIS REMARK BUT TO OAK WHO KNEW BATHSHEBA TO BE WELL AWARE THAT SHE HERSELF WAS THE CAUSE OF THE POOR EWE'S WOUND BECAUSE SHE HAD WOUNDED THE EWE'S SHEARER IN A STILL MORE VITAL PART
TO REACH HIS PRESENT STAGE OF PROGRESS THAT NO MORE SEEMED TO BE LEFT IN HIM HE LEANT DOWN UPON A RAIL AND COVERED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS STUPORS HOWEVER DO NOT LAST FOR EVER AND FARMER OAK RECOVERED FROM HIS
AND NOW NIGHT DROOPED SLOWLY UPON THE WIDE WATERY LEVELS IN FRONT AND AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM THEM WHERE THE SHORELINE CURVED ROUND
BRAVELY BORNE SAID TROY YOU DIDN'T FLINCH A SHADE'S THICKNESS WONDERFUL IN A WOMAN IT WAS BECAUSE I DIDN'T EXPECT IT OH YOU HAVE SPOILT MY HAIR ONLY ONCE MORE NO NO I AM AFRAID OF YOU INDEED I AM SHE CRIED
BATHSHEBA AFTER THROWING A GLANCE HERE A CAUTION THERE AND LECTURING ONE OF THE YOUNGER OPERATORS WHO HAD ALLOWED HIS LAST FINISHED SHEEP TO GO OFF AMONG THE FLOCK WITHOUT RE STAMPING IT WITH HER INITIALS CAME AGAIN TO GABRIEL
WHICH A TOO CURIOUS REFLECTION WAS APT TO DISTURB IN ITS ECCLESIASTICAL AND MILITARY COMPEERS FOR ONCE MEDIAEVALISM AND MODERNISM HAD A COMMON STAND POINT THE LANCEOLATE WINDOWS THE TIME EATEN ARCHSTONES AND CHAMFERS THE ORIENTATION OF THE AXIS
SO YIELDING THAT THE FOOT WAS HALF BURIED WITHIN IT NOW SAID TROY PRODUCING THE SWORD WHICH AS HE RAISED IT INTO THE SUNLIGHT GLEAMED A SORT OF GREETING LIKE A LIVING THING
AND THOUGHT OF WHAT THERE WOULD BE FOR DINNER WHEN HE MEANT TO BE LISTENING TO THE SERMON OR TO STATE HIS CHARACTER AS IT STOOD IN THE SCALE OF PUBLIC OPINION WHEN HIS FRIENDS AND CRITICS WERE IN TANTRUMS HE WAS CONSIDERED RATHER A BAD MAN WHEN THEY WERE PLEASED HE WAS RATHER A GOOD MAN
SHE WAS FAR FROM HAVING A WISH TO APPEAR MYSTERIOUSLY CONNECTED WITH HIM BUT WOMAN AT THE IMPRESSIONABLE AGE GRAVITATES TO THE LARGER BODY NOT ONLY IN HER CHOICE OF WORDS WHICH IS APPARENT EVERY DAY BUT EVEN IN HER SHADES OF TONE AND HUMOUR WHEN THE INFLUENCE IS GREAT
TILL IT HAD GROWN AS SLIPPERY AND AS RICH IN HUE AS THE STATE ROOM FLOORS OF AN ELIZABETHAN MANSION HERE THE SHEARERS KNELT THE SUN SLANTING IN UPON THEIR BLEACHED SHIRTS TANNED ARMS AND THE POLISHED SHEARS THEY FLOURISHED
THE FIELD HE WAS IN THIS MORNING SLOPED TO A RIDGE CALLED NORCOMBE HILL THROUGH A SPUR OF THIS HILL RAN THE HIGHWAY BETWEEN EMMINSTER AND CHALK NEWTON
AMONG THE FERNS WITH BATHSHEBA IT MAY SAFELY BE ASSERTED WITH RESPECT TO THE CLOSENESS OF HIS CUTS THAT HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE FOR THE EDGE OF THE SWORD TO LEAVE IN THE AIR A PERMANENT SUBSTANCE WHEREVER IT FLEW PAST
HE COULD CURE EM ALL IF HE WERE HERE WHO IS HE LET'S GET HIM SHEPHERD OAK SAID MATTHEW
A KIND OF MEAT HE USUALLY KEPT FROM THEM EXCEPT WHEN OTHER FOOD RAN SHORT AND CONCLUDING THAT THE YOUNG ONE HAD NOT FINISHED HIS MEAL HE WENT INDOORS TO THE LUXURY OF A BED WHICH LATTERLY HE HAD ONLY ENJOYED ON SUNDAYS
BATHSHEBA DEMURELY REGARDED A CONTEMPTIBLE STRAW LYING UPON THE GROUND IN A WAY WHICH SUGGESTED LESS OVINE CRITICISM THAN WOMANLY EMBARRASSMENT
OILY POLISH NOTHING MOVED IN SKY LAND OR SEA EXCEPT A FRILL OF MILKWHITE FOAM ALONG THE NEARER ANGLES OF THE SHORE SHREDS OF WHICH LICKED THE CONTIGUOUS STONES LIKE TONGUES
FORMING THE BULK OF THE FLOCK WERE NOWHERE GABRIEL CALLED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE
AND ATTEMPT PERFECTLY CONSISTENT CONDUCT IN A WORLD MADE UP SO LARGELY OF COMPROMISE GABRIEL'S FARM HAD BEEN STOCKED BY A DEALER ON THE STRENGTH OF OAK'S PROMISING LOOK AND CHARACTER
HIS HOPES OF BEING AN INDEPENDENT FARMER WERE LAID LOW POSSIBLY FOR EVER GABRIEL'S ENERGIES PATIENCE AND INDUSTRY HAD BEEN SO SEVERELY TAXED DURING THE YEARS OF HIS LIFE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHT AND TWENTY
MATTHEW MOON FRAY AND HALF A DOZEN OTHERS CAME RUNNING UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE MISTRESS OF THE UPPER FARM
THEIR MAKER BEING A CONSCIENTIOUS MAN WHO ENDEAVOURED TO COMPENSATE FOR ANY WEAKNESS IN HIS CUT BY UNSTINTED DIMENSION AND SOLIDITY MISTER OAK CARRIED ABOUT HIM BY WAY OF WATCH WHAT MAY BE CALLED A SMALL SILVER CLOCK
FIRST WE HAVE FOUR RIGHT AND FOUR LEFT CUTS FOUR RIGHT AND FOUR LEFT THRUSTS INFANTRY CUTS AND GUARDS ARE MORE INTERESTING THAN OURS TO MY MIND BUT THEY ARE NOT SO SWASHING
HE HAD JUST REACHED THE TIME OF LIFE AT WHICH YOUNG IS CEASING TO BE THE PREFIX OF MAN IN SPEAKING OF ONE HE WAS AT THE BRIGHTEST PERIOD OF MASCULINE GROWTH FOR HIS INTELLECT AND HIS EMOTIONS WERE CLEARLY SEPARATED
AT LENGTH SHE DREW THE ARTICLE INTO HER LAP AND UNTIED THE PAPER COVERING A SMALL SWING LOOKING GLASS WAS DISCLOSED IN WHICH SHE PROCEEDED TO SURVEY HERSELF ATTENTIVELY SHE PARTED HER LIPS AND SMILED
THE MORNING STAR DOGGING HER ON THE LEFT HAND THE POOL GLITTERED LIKE A DEAD MAN'S EYE AND AS THE WORLD AWOKE A BREEZE BLEW SHAKING AND ELONGATING THE REFLECTION OF THE MOON WITHOUT BREAKING IT
LENDING HIM WHAT LITTLE CLOTHING THEY COULD SPARE AMONG THEM AS A SLIGHT PROTECTION AGAINST THE RAPIDLY COOLING AIR THEY AGREED TO LAND HIM IN THE MORNING AND WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY FOR IT WAS GROWING LATE THEY MADE AGAIN TOWARDS THE ROADSTEAD WHERE THEIR VESSEL LAY
I NEVER KNEW A FLOCK PASS A YEAR WITHOUT GETTING INTO SOME SCRAPE OR OTHER THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OF SAVING THEM SAID TALL WHAT WAY TELL ME QUICK THEY MUST BE PIERCED IN THE SIDE WITH A THING MADE ON PURPOSE CAN YOU DO IT CAN I
AND THE MEN SAW HIM AT ONCE BACKING THEIR OARS AND PUTTING THE BOAT ABOUT THEY PULLED TOWARDS HIM WITH A WILL AND IN FIVE OR SIX MINUTES FROM THE TIME OF HIS FIRST HALLOO
IN A WILLOW BASKET FROM THE PARTLY OPENED LID OF WHICH SHE GAZED WITH HALF CLOSED EYES AND AFFECTIONATELY SURVEYED THE SMALL BIRDS AROUND
SHE SAW THE POINT GLISTEN TOWARDS HER BOSOM AND SEEMINGLY ENTER IT BATHSHEBA CLOSED HER EYES IN THE FULL PERSUASION THAT SHE WAS KILLED AT LAST HOWEVER FEELING JUST AS USUAL SHE OPENED THEM AGAIN
MANY OF THEM FOAMED AT THE MOUTH THEIR BREATHING BEING QUICK AND SHORT WHILST THE BODIES OF ALL WERE FEARFULLY DISTENDED OH WHAT CAN I DO WHAT CAN I DO SAID BATHSHEBA HELPLESSLY SHEEP ARE SUCH UNFORTUNATE ANIMALS THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING HAPPENING TO THEM
HIS FIRST FEELING NOW WAS ONE OF PITY FOR THE UNTIMELY FATE OF THESE GENTLE EWES AND THEIR UNBORN LAMBS IT WAS A SECOND TO REMEMBER ANOTHER PHASE OF THE MATTER THE SHEEP WERE NOT INSURED ALL THE SAVINGS OF A FRUGAL LIFE HAD BEEN DISPERSED AT A BLOW
OH OH THAT'S HIS ANSWER WHERE DOES HE GET HIS AIRS WHO AM I THEN TO BE TREATED LIKE THAT SHALL I BEG TO A MAN WHO HAS BEGGED TO ME ANOTHER OF THE FLOCK SPRANG INTO THE AIR AND FELL DEAD THE MEN LOOKED GRAVE AS IF THEY SUPPRESSED OPINION
FROM THE WOOL AS IT HERE EXISTS NEW AND PURE BEFORE THE UNCTUOUSNESS OF ITS NATURE WHILST IN A LIVING STATE HAS DRIED STIFFENED AND BEEN WASHED OUT RENDERING IT JUST NOW AS SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING WOOLLEN AS CREAM IS SUPERIOR TO MILK AND WATER
PERUSING IT NOW QUITE FREQUENTLY AND HE INWARDLY SAID I FIND MORE BITTER THAN DEATH THE WOMAN WHOSE HEART IS SNARES AND NETS THIS WAS MERE EXCLAMATION THE FROTH OF THE STORM HE ADORED BATHSHEBA JUST THE SAME
BUT AFTER HAVING BEEN POINTED OUT FOR SO MANY YEARS AS THE PERFECT EXEMPLAR OF THRIVING BACHELORSHIP HIS LAPSE WAS AN ANTICLIMAX SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING THAT OF SAINT JOHN LONG'S DEATH BY CONSUMPTION IN THE MIDST OF HIS PROOFS THAT IT WAS NOT A FATAL DISEASE
OR PRESS A DIMPLE INTO SHAPE OR DO ONE THING TO SIGNIFY THAT ANY SUCH INTENTION HAD BEEN HER MOTIVE IN TAKING UP THE GLASS SHE SIMPLY OBSERVED HERSELF AS A FAIR PRODUCT OF NATURE IN THE FEMININE KIND HER THOUGHTS SEEMING TO GLIDE INTO FAR OFF THOUGH LIKELY DRAMAS
MORE THAN TWENTY MILES OFF BUT IN WHAT CAPACITY WHETHER AS A VISITOR OR PERMANENTLY HE COULD NOT DISCOVER GABRIEL HAD TWO DOGS GEORGE THE ELDER EXHIBITED AN EBONY TIPPED NOSE SURROUNDED BY A NARROW MARGIN OF PINK FLESH
LIKE GUILDENSTERN OAK WAS HAPPY IN THAT HE WAS NOT OVER HAPPY HE HAD NO WISH TO CONVERSE WITH HER THAT HIS BRIGHT LADY AND HIMSELF FORMED ONE GROUP EXCLUSIVELY THEIR OWN AND CONTAINING NO OTHERS IN THE WORLD WAS ENOUGH
A STRANGE OLD PIECE GOODMEN WHIRLED ABOUT FROM HERE TO YONDER AS IF I WERE NOTHING A LITTLE WARPED TOO BUT I HAVE MY DEPTHS HA AND EVEN MY GREAT DEPTHS I MIGHT GIRD AT A CERTAIN SHEPHERD BRAIN TO BRAIN BUT NO O NO
AND CARRIED HIM ON AS BY GRAVITATION A SHADOW IN HIS LIFE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THAT HIS FLOCK ENDED IN MUTTON THAT A DAY CAME AND FOUND EVERY SHEPHERD AN ARRANT TRAITOR TO HIS DEFENSELESS SHEEP
BATHSHEBA HAD SHOWN INDICATIONS OF ANOINTING HIM ABOVE HIS FELLOWS BY INSTALLING HIM AS THE BAILIFF THAT THE FARM IMPERATIVELY REQUIRED HE DID NOT COVET THE POST RELATIVELY TO THE FARM
THE THIRD ITEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS WAS THAT OF SEEING THE SAME SWORD PERFECTLY CLEAN AND FREE FROM BLOOD HELD VERTICALLY IN TROY'S HAND IN THE POSITION TECHNICALLY CALLED RECOVER SWORDS ALL WAS AS QUICK AS ELECTRICITY
THAT OUTER LOOSE LOCK OF HAIR WANTS TIDYING HE SAID BEFORE SHE HAD MOVED OR SPOKEN WAIT I'LL DO IT FOR YOU AN ARC OF SILVER SHONE ON HER RIGHT SIDE THE SWORD HAD DESCENDED THE LOCK DROPPED TO THE GROUND
WAS AWKWARD FOR A SWIMMER WHO MIGHT BE TAKEN IN IT UNAWARES TROY FOUND HIMSELF CARRIED TO THE LEFT AND THEN ROUND IN A SWOOP OUT TO SEA
THAT MINUTE'S INTERVAL HAD BROUGHT THE BLOOD BEATING INTO HER FACE SET HER STINGING AS IF AFLAME TO THE VERY HOLLOWS OF HER FEET AND ENLARGED EMOTION TO A COMPASS WHICH QUITE SWAMPED THOUGHT
HE DESCENDED AND CAME TO A SMALL BASIN OF SEA ENCLOSED BY THE CLIFFS TROY'S NATURE FRESHENED WITHIN HIM HE THOUGHT HE WOULD REST AND BATHE HERE BEFORE GOING FARTHER
AY AND AS A YOUNG MAN WHEN MY SENSES WERE IN PROSPERITY I WAS LIKEWISE LIKED BY A GOOD FEW WHO KNOWED ME SAID THE MALTSTER
IT DISAPPEARED ON THE OTHER SIDE SHE WAITED ONE MINUTE TWO MINUTES THOUGHT OF TROY'S DISAPPOINTMENT AT HER NON FULFILMENT OF A PROMISED ENGAGEMENT TILL SHE AGAIN RAN ALONG THE FIELD CLAMBERED OVER THE BANK
CAUSING THESE TO BRISTLE WITH A THOUSAND RAYS STRONG ENOUGH TO BLIND A WEAK EYED MAN BENEATH THEM A CAPTIVE SHEEP LAY PANTING QUICKENING ITS PANTS AS MISGIVING MERGED IN TERROR TILL IT QUIVERED LIKE THE HOT LANDSCAPE OUTSIDE
THE TWO SIDES APPROACHING EACH OTHER IN A GRADUAL TAPER TILL THEY MET THE SKY AT THE TOP ABOUT TWO MILES OFF THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH OF THIS NARROW AND IRKSOME INCLINED PLANE NOT A SIGN OF LIFE WAS VISIBLE ON THIS GARISH AFTERNOON
IT WAS A FINE MORNING AND THE SUN LIGHTED UP TO A SCARLET GLOW THE CRIMSON JACKET SHE WORE AND PAINTED A SOFT LUSTRE UPON HER BRIGHT FACE AND DARK HAIR THE MYRTLES GERANIUMS AND CACTUSES PACKED AROUND HER WERE FRESH AND GREEN
HE TOUCHED THE PALM OF HIS HAND WITH THE BLADE AND THEN LIFTING IT SHOWED HER A THIN SHAVING OF SCARF SKIN DANGLING THEREFROM BUT YOU SAID BEFORE BEGINNING THAT IT WAS BLUNT AND COULDN'T CUT ME
HAD BEEN INDEPENDENT IN THOUGHT AND VIGOROUS IN ACTION TO A MARKED EXTENT CONDITIONS WHICH POWERLESS WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY AS AN OPPORTUNITY WITHOUT THEM IS BARREN WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM A SURE LIFT UPWARDS WHEN THE FAVOURABLE CONJUNCTION SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED
DEAL GREW IN THE PLANTATION HE FOLLOWED THROUGH THE HEDGE THEY WERE NOT IN THE PLANTATION HE CALLED AGAIN THE VALLEYS AND FARTHEST HILLS RESOUNDED AS WHEN THE SAILORS INVOKED THE LOST
THAT MEANS MATRIMONY SAID TEMPERANCE MILLER FOLLOWING THEM OUT OF SIGHT WITH HER EYES
ONE TWO THREE FOUR LEFT HE REPEATED THEM HAVE EM AGAIN HE SAID ONE TWO SHE HURRIEDLY INTERRUPTED I'D RATHER NOT THOUGH I DON'T MIND YOUR TWOS AND FOURS BUT YOUR ONES AND THREES ARE TERRIBLE
THE WATCH WAS AS A NECESSITY PULLED OUT BY THROWING THE BODY TO ONE SIDE COMPRESSING THE MOUTH AND FACE TO A MERE MASS OF RUDDY FLESH ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXERTION REQUIRED AND DRAWING UP THE WATCH BY ITS CHAIN LIKE A BUCKET FROM A WELL
AND WAS IN FACT TAKEN AND TRAGICALLY SHOT AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THAT SAME DAY ANOTHER INSTANCE OF THE UNTOWARD FATE WHICH SO OFTEN ATTENDS DOGS AND OTHER PHILOSOPHERS WHO FOLLOW OUT A TRAIN OF REASONING TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION
CHECKED THE EXTENSION A THOUSANDTH OF AN INCH SHORT OF YOUR SURFACE BUT HOW COULD YOU CHOP OFF A CURL OF MY HAIR WITH A SWORD THAT HAS NO EDGE NO EDGE THIS SWORD WILL SHAVE LIKE A RAZOR LOOK HERE
A HEAP OF TWO HUNDRED MANGLED CARCASSES REPRESENTING IN THEIR CONDITION JUST NOW AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED MORE OAK WAS AN INTENSELY HUMANE MAN INDEED HIS HUMANITY OFTEN TORE IN PIECES ANY POLITIC INTENTIONS OF HIS WHICH BORDERED ON STRATEGY
AND CAREFULLY PUT IT INSIDE SHE FELT POWERLESS TO WITHSTAND OR DENY HIM HE WAS ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH FOR HER AND BATHSHEBA SEEMED AS ONE WHO FACING A REVIVING WIND FINDS IT BLOW SO STRONGLY THAT IT STOPS THE BREATH
WHAT THEY CONVERSED ABOUT WAS NOT AUDIBLE TO GABRIEL WHO WAS TOO INDEPENDENT TO GET NEAR THOUGH TOO CONCERNED TO DISREGARD THE ISSUE OF THEIR DIALOGUE WAS THE TAKING OF HER HAND BY THE COURTEOUS FARMER TO HELP HER OVER THE SPREADING BOARD INTO THE BRIGHT JUNE SUNLIGHT OUTSIDE
IT WAS A STILL MOIST NIGHT JUST BEFORE DAWN HE WAS ASSISTED IN WAKING BY THE ABNORMAL REVERBERATION OF FAMILIAR MUSIC TO THE SHEPHERD THE NOTE OF THE SHEEP BELL LIKE THE TICKING OF THE CLOCK TO OTHER PEOPLE
IT NOT ONLY EMULATED THE FORM OF THE NEIGHBOURING CHURCH OF THE PARISH BUT VIED WITH IT IN ANTIQUITY WHETHER THE BARN HAD EVER FORMED ONE OF A GROUP OF CONVENTUAL BUILDINGS NOBODY SEEMED TO BE AWARE NO TRACE OF SUCH SURROUNDINGS REMAINED
TO ME HE WAS UNWEARIEDLY KIND AND ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE ME IN THE GALLEY WHICH HE KEPT AS CLEAN AS A NEW PIN THE DISHES HANGING UP BURNISHED AND HIS PARROT IN A CAGE IN ONE CORNER
MY CURIOSITY IN A SENSE WAS STRONGER THAN MY FEAR FOR I COULD NOT REMAIN WHERE I WAS BUT CREPT BACK TO THE BANK AGAIN WHENCE SHELTERING MY HEAD BEHIND A BUSH OF BROOM I MIGHT COMMAND THE ROAD BEFORE OUR DOOR
ONLY NOW AND AGAIN INTERRUPTED BY THE OTHER BY THE SOUND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TALKING EARNESTLY AND ALMOST FIERCELY BUT NO DISTINCT WORD CAME TO MY HEARING AT LAST THE SPEAKERS SEEMED TO HAVE PAUSED AND PERHAPS TO HAVE SAT DOWN
THREATENED HIM IN HORRID TERMS AND TRIED IN VAIN TO CATCH THE STICK AND WREST IT FROM HIS GRASP THIS QUARREL WAS THE SAVING OF US FOR WHILE IT WAS STILL RAGING ANOTHER SOUND CAME FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL ON THE SIDE OF THE HAMLET
THE TASTE OF THE TROPICAL FRUITS AND ABOVE ALL THE LIGHTS THAT BEGAN TO SHINE IN THE TOWN MADE A MOST CHARMING CONTRAST TO OUR DARK AND BLOODY SOJOURN ON THE ISLAND AND THE DOCTOR AND THE SQUIRE TAKING ME ALONG WITH THEM WENT ASHORE
WELL THEN HAWKINS WHAT IN FORTUNE WERE THEY AFTER MORE MONEY I SUPPOSE NO SIR NOT MONEY I THINK REPLIED I
I WAS SCARCELY IN POSITION ERE MY ENEMIES BEGAN TO ARRIVE SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THEM RUNNING HARD THEIR FEET BEATING OUT OF TIME ALONG THE ROAD AND THE MAN WITH THE LANTERN SOME PACES IN FRONT THREE MEN RAN TOGETHER HAND IN HAND
WE WERE ALREADY BETWEEN THEM AND THE BOATS
AND STRAGGLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO THE BEACH WHERE THE TWO GIGS AWAITED US EVEN THESE BORE TRACE OF THE DRUNKEN FOLLY OF THE PIRATES ONE IN A BROKEN THWART AND BOTH IN THEIR MUDDY AND UNBAILED CONDITION
AND AT THE SAME TIME A BULLET WHISTLED CLOSE BY HIS ARM SOON AFTER THE LUGGER DOUBLED THE POINT AND DISAPPEARED MISTER DANCE STOOD THERE AS HE SAID LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER
THEY MUST BE CLOSE BY THEY CAN'T BE FAR YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON IT SCATTER AND LOOK FOR THEM DOGS OH SHIVER MY SOUL HE CRIED
THE FIRST OF THE TALL TREES WAS REACHED AND BY THE BEARINGS PROVED THE WRONG ONE SO WITH THE SECOND THE THIRD ROSE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FEET INTO THE AIR ABOVE A CLUMP OF UNDERWOOD A GIANT OF A VEGETABLE WITH A RED COLUMN AS BIG AS A COTTAGE
A MAN WHO HAS BEEN THREE YEARS BITING HIS NAILS ON A DESERT ISLAND JIM CAN'T EXPECT TO APPEAR AS SANE AS YOU OR ME IT DOESN'T LIE IN HUMAN NATURE WAS IT CHEESE YOU SAID HE HAD A FANCY FOR YES SIR CHEESE
A BIBLE WITH A BIT CUT OUT RETURNED SILVER DERISIVELY NOT IT
THAT SAVES THE TROUBLE OF PUTTING HIM IN IRONS BUT THERE WE WERE WITHOUT A MATE AND IT WAS NECESSARY OF COURSE TO ADVANCE ONE OF THE MEN THE BOATSWAIN
BUT NOW I FIND THAT EVERY MAN BEFORE THE MAST KNOWS MORE THAN I DO I DON'T CALL THAT FAIR NOW DO YOU NO SAID DOCTOR LIVESEY I DON'T
HIM THEY HAD DESERTED WHETHER IN SHEER PANIC OR OUT OF REVENGE FOR HIS ILL WORDS AND BLOWS I KNOW NOT BUT THERE HE REMAINED BEHIND TAPPING UP AND DOWN THE ROAD IN A FRENZY AND GROPING AND CALLING FOR HIS COMRADES
HERE IS A NARROW CORNER AS
HE HIMSELF SLEPT PEACEFULLY AND SNORED ALOUD YET
NOW BARBECUE TIP US A STAVE CRIED ONE VOICE THE OLD ONE CRIED ANOTHER AYE AYE MATES SAID LONG JOHN
IF YOU PLEASE BEAR UP UNTIL YOU SEE YOU'RE GAINING I TRIED AND FOUND BY EXPERIMENT THAT THE TIDE KEPT SWEEPING US WESTWARD UNTIL I HAD LAID HER HEAD DUE EAST
BUT IF I WERE SURE THEY WERE RAVING AS I AM MORALLY CERTAIN ONE AT LEAST OF THEM IS DOWN WITH FEVER I SHOULD LEAVE THIS CAMP AND AT WHATEVER RISK TO MY OWN CARCASS TAKE THEM THE ASSISTANCE OF MY SKILL
IT'S THE GLORY OF THE SEA THAT HAS TURNED MY HEAD SO NOW LIVESEY COME POST DO NOT LOSE AN HOUR IF YOU RESPECT ME LET YOUNG HAWKINS GO AT ONCE TO SEE HIS MOTHER WITH REDRUTH FOR A GUARD AND THEN BOTH COME FULL SPEED TO BRISTOL
TIRED THOUGH WE ALL WERE TWO WERE SENT OUT FOR FIREWOOD TWO MORE WERE SET TO DIG A GRAVE FOR REDRUTH THE DOCTOR WAS NAMED COOK I WAS PUT SENTRY AT THE DOOR
SOME NEWS OF THE LUGGER IN KITT'S HOLE HAD FOUND ITS WAY TO SUPERVISOR DANCE AND SET HIM FORTH THAT NIGHT IN OUR DIRECTION AND TO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE MY MOTHER AND I OWED OUR PRESERVATION FROM DEATH PEW WAS DEAD
BUT I'LL STAKE MY WIG THERE'S FEVER HERE IF THE CONDUCT OF THE MEN HAD BEEN ALARMING IN THE BOAT IT BECAME TRULY THREATENING WHEN THEY HAD COME ABOARD THEY LAY ABOUT THE DECK GROWLING TOGETHER IN TALK
SHOULD ANY BE INTENDED HE TURNED AND SPOKE TO US DOCTOR'S WATCH ON THE LOOKOUT
I MADE STEADILY BUT SLOWLY TOWARDS THEM TILL AT LAST RAISING MY HEAD TO AN APERTURE AMONG THE LEAVES I COULD SEE CLEAR DOWN INTO A LITTLE GREEN DELL BESIDE THE MARSH AND CLOSELY SET ABOUT WITH TREES WHERE LONG JOHN SILVER
STAND BY TO GO ABOUT THE PARROT WOULD SCREAM AH SHE'S A HANDSOME CRAFT SHE IS THE COOK WOULD SAY AND GIVE HER SUGAR FROM HIS POCKET
THAT VOYAGE IN DETAIL IT WAS FAIRLY PROSPEROUS THE SHIP PROVED TO BE A GOOD SHIP THE CREW WERE CAPABLE SEAMEN AND THE CAPTAIN THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD HIS BUSINESS
AND THE FOREMOST BROKE INTO A RUN AND SUDDENLY NOT TEN YARDS FURTHER WE BEHELD THEM STOP A LOW CRY AROSE SILVER DOUBLED HIS PACE DIGGING AWAY WITH THE FOOT OF HIS CRUTCH LIKE ONE POSSESSED AND NEXT MOMENT HE AND I HAD COME ALSO TO A DEAD HALT
AT LAST MERRY SEEMED TO THINK A SPEECH MIGHT HELP MATTERS
A PECULIAR STAGNANT SMELL HUNG OVER THE ANCHORAGE A SMELL OF SODDEN LEAVES AND ROTTING TREE TRUNKS I OBSERVED THE DOCTOR SNIFFING AND SNIFFING LIKE SOMEONE TASTING A BAD EGG I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TREASURE HE SAID
FOR NOT ONLY DID THEY CEASE TO DRAW ANY NEARER BUT THE BIRDS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO GROW MORE QUIET AND TO SETTLE AGAIN TO THEIR PLACES IN THE SWAMP AND NOW I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT I WAS NEGLECTING MY BUSINESS
WHISTLED THROUGH EVERY CHINK OF THE RUDE BUILDING AND SPRINKLED THE FLOOR WITH A CONTINUAL RAIN OF FINE SAND THERE WAS SAND IN OUR EYES SAND IN OUR TEETH SAND IN OUR SUPPERS SAND DANCING IN THE SPRING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE KETTLE
SOMETIMES FULL OF DANGEROUS ANIMALS THAT HUNTED US BUT IN ALL MY FANCIES NOTHING OCCURRED TO ME SO STRANGE AND TRAGIC AS OUR ACTUAL ADVENTURES SO THE WEEKS PASSED ON TILL ONE FINE DAY
NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR THE JOLLY BOAT'S LAST TRIP THIS FIFTH TRIP WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE OTHERS IN THE FIRST PLACE
HOW MANY IT HAD COST IN THE AMASSING WHAT BLOOD AND SORROW WHAT GOOD SHIPS SCUTTLED ON THE DEEP WHAT BRAVE MEN WALKING THE PLANK BLINDFOLD WHAT SHOT OF CANNON WHAT SHAME AND LIES AND CRUELTY
AND THEN I'LL GIVE YOU MY AFFY DAVY UPON MY WORD OF HONOUR TO CLAP YOU SOMEWHERE SAFE ASHORE
ALL SHIPSHAPE AND SEAWORTHY WELL SIR SAID THE CAPTAIN BETTER SPEAK PLAIN I BELIEVE EVEN AT THE RISK OF OFFENCE I DON'T LIKE THIS CRUISE
HERE YOU SHIP'S BOY HE CRIED OUT O THAT OFF WITH YOU TO THE COOK AND GET SOME WORK AND THEN AS I WAS HURRYING OFF I HEARD HIM SAY QUITE LOUDLY TO THE DOCTOR
AND TO BRUSH ONE'S CLOTHES BUT NOT ENTIRELY FITTED FOR A MAN OF WAR WITH ALL THIS IN OUR MINDS WE WADED ASHORE AS FAST AS WE COULD LEAVING BEHIND US
WELL WHAT IS IT ANYWAY AH DEPOSED' THAT'S IT IS IT VERY PRETTY WROTE TO BE SURE LIKE PRINT I SWEAR YOUR HAND O WRITE GEORGE
AND HAD ADDED SOME FURNITURE ABOVE ALL A BEAUTIFUL ARMCHAIR FOR MOTHER IN THE BAR HE HAD FOUND HER A BOY AS AN APPRENTICE ALSO SO THAT SHE SHOULD NOT WANT HELP WHILE I WAS GONE
ALL MAY BE FOR WHAT I KNOW BUT I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHIP'S SAFETY AND THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN JACK ABOARD OF HER I SEE THINGS GOING AS I THINK
SHOT FAR AHEAD OF HER CONSORT AND THE BOW HAD STRUCK AMONG THE SHORE SIDE TREES AND I HAD CAUGHT A BRANCH AND SWUNG MYSELF OUT AND PLUNGED INTO THE NEAREST THICKET WHILE SILVER AND THE REST WERE STILL A HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND
IF I DIE LIKE A DOG I'LL DIE IN MY DOOTY YOU'VE KILLED ALAN HAVE YOU KILL ME TOO IF YOU CAN BUT I DEFIES YOU AND WITH THAT THIS BRAVE FELLOW TURNED HIS BACK DIRECTLY ON THE COOK AND SET OFF WALKING FOR THE BEACH
AND ABOVE ALL IN THE REMARKABLE GAME THAT I SAW SILVER NOW ENGAGED UPON KEEPING THE MUTINEERS TOGETHER WITH ONE HAND AND GRASPING WITH THE OTHER AFTER EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HIS PEACE AND SAVE HIS MISERABLE LIFE
NOW RESUMED SILVER HERE IT IS YOU GIVE US THE CHART TO GET THE TREASURE BY
THE HISPANIOLA ROLLED STEADILY DIPPING HER BOWSPRIT NOW AND THEN WITH A WHIFF OF SPRAY ALL WAS DRAWING ALOW AND ALOFT EVERYONE WAS IN THE BRAVEST SPIRITS
AND OFF TO SEA LIKE JOLLY COMPANIONS WHY THEN WE'LL TALK MISTER HAWKINS OVER WE WILL AND WE'LL GIVE HIM HIS SHARE TO BE SURE FOR ALL HIS KINDNESS
WHOM I HAD SEEN SO GLOOMY SHOUTING AT THE OARS LIKE CHILDREN BUT THERE WAS A SOUND IN THEIR VOICES WHICH SUGGESTED RUM AT LENGTH I THOUGHT I MIGHT RETURN TOWARDS THE STOCKADE
BEN GUNN'S LAST WORDS CAME BACK TO MY MIND I BEGAN TO SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD PAID THE BUCCANEERS A VISIT WHILE THEY ALL LAY DRUNK TOGETHER ROUND THEIR FIRE AND I RECKONED UP WITH GLEE THAT WE HAD ONLY FOURTEEN ENEMIES TO DEAL WITH
IT WAS LONGER THAN THE SQUIRE IMAGINED ERE WE WERE READY FOR THE SEA AND NONE OF OUR FIRST PLANS NOT EVEN DOCTOR LIVESEY'S OF KEEPING ME BESIDE HIM COULD BE CARRIED OUT AS WE INTENDED
WE STARTED CERTAINLY BUT IN SPITE OF THE HOT SUN AND THE STARING DAYLIGHT THE PIRATES NO LONGER RAN SEPARATE AND SHOUTING THROUGH THE WOOD
COME AWAY HAWKINS HE WOULD SAY COME AND HAVE A YARN WITH JOHN NOBODY MORE WELCOME THAN YOURSELF MY SON SIT YOU DOWN AND HEAR THE NEWS
WELL HERE IT IS SAID SILVER WE WANT THAT TREASURE AND WE'LL HAVE IT THAT'S OUR POINT YOU WOULD JUST AS SOON SAVE YOUR LIVES I RECKON AND THAT'S YOURS YOU HAVE A CHART HAVEN'T YOU
AND A FIGURE STANDING BY IT LEANING ON A MUSKET IT WAS THE SQUIRE AND WE WAVED A HANDKERCHIEF AND GAVE HIM THREE CHEERS IN WHICH THE VOICE OF SILVER JOINED AS HEARTILY AS ANY THREE MILES FARTHER JUST INSIDE THE MOUTH OF NORTH INLET
SEVERELY WOUNDED IF HE WERE NOT DEAD EVERY TIME WE HAD A CRACK AT THEM WE WERE TO TAKE IT
BEFORE YOU COULD WINK LONG JOHN HAD FIRED TWO BARRELS OF A PISTOL INTO THE STRUGGLING MERRY AND AS THE MAN ROLLED UP HIS EYES AT HIM IN THE LAST AGONY GEORGE SAID HE
IF WE CAN COME TO TERMS AND NO BONES ABOUT IT ALL I ASK IS YOUR WORD CAP'N SMOLLETT TO LET ME SAFE AND SOUND OUT OF THIS HERE STOCKADE AND ONE MINUTE TO GET OUT O SHOT BEFORE A GUN IS FIRED MY MAN
BUT IT WAS PLAIN THAT THEY MEANT NOTHING SHOULD DELAY THEIR SHOT THEY HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS LOOKED AT THEIR FALLEN COMRADE THOUGH HE WAS NOT DEAD
SEE HERE NOW HAWKINS SAID HE HERE'S A BLESSED HARD THING ON A MAN LIKE ME NOW AIN'T IT THERE'S CAP'N TRELAWNEY WHAT'S HE TO THINK HERE I HAVE THIS CONFOUNDED SON OF A DUTCHMAN SITTING IN MY OWN HOUSE DRINKING OF MY OWN RUM
NO OTHER THAN A GREAT SHIP'S KETTLE OF IRON WITH THE BOTTOM KNOCKED OUT AND SUNK TO HER BEARINGS AS THE CAPTAIN SAID AMONG THE SAND LITTLE HAD BEEN LEFT BESIDES THE FRAMEWORK OF THE HOUSE
OBEYING THIS ORDER WE FOUND OR RATHER I FOUND FOR THE GAMEKEEPER WAS A POOR HAND AT READING ANYTHING BUT PRINT THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT NEWS OLD ANCHOR INN
THEREFORE THE WORK WAS PUSHED ON BRISKLY GRAY AND BEN GUNN CAME AND WENT WITH THE BOAT WHILE THE REST DURING THEIR ABSENCES
THE TREASURE HUNT FLINT'S POINTER JIM SAID SILVER WHEN WE WERE ALONE IF I SAVED YOUR LIFE YOU SAVED MINE AND I'LL NOT FORGET IT I SEEN THE DOCTOR WAVING YOU TO RUN FOR IT WITH THE TAIL OF MY EYE I DID
AND AT THIS POINT TOM FLASHED OUT LIKE A HERO ALAN HE CRIED THEN REST HIS SOUL FOR A TRUE SEAMAN AND AS FOR YOU JOHN SILVER LONG YOU'VE BEEN A MATE OF MINE BUT YOU'RE MATE OF MINE NO MORE
THEN THERE FOLLOWED A GREAT TO DO THROUGH ALL OUR OLD INN HEAVY FEET POUNDING TO AND FRO FURNITURE THROWN OVER DOORS KICKED IN UNTIL THE VERY ROCKS RE ECHOED
SITTING BY THE FIRE IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM I APPROACHED THAT ISLAND IN MY FANCY FROM EVERY POSSIBLE DIRECTION I EXPLORED EVERY ACRE OF ITS SURFACE
THREW WHAT WAS LEFT INTO THE FIRE WHICH BLAZED AND ROARED AGAIN OVER THIS UNUSUAL FUEL I NEVER IN MY LIFE SAW MEN SO CARELESS OF THE MORROW HAND TO MOUTH IS THE ONLY WORD THAT CAN DESCRIBE THEIR WAY OF DOING
THE POOR JOLLY BOAT I AFTERWARDS DISCOVERED AWAY NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER A GREAT FIRE WAS GLOWING AMONG THE TREES AND BETWEEN THAT POINT AND THE SHIP ONE OF THE GIGS KEPT COMING AND GOING THE MEN
WHEN THAT UNGODLY BUCCANEER WITH THE BLUE FACE HE WHO DIED AT SAVANNAH SINGING AND SHOUTING FOR DRINK HAD THERE WITH HIS OWN HAND CUT DOWN HIS SIX ACCOMPLICES THIS GROVE THAT WAS NOW SO PEACEFUL
CAPTAIN SMOLLETT IS NOW RETIRED FROM THE SEA GRAY NOT ONLY SAVED HIS MONEY BUT BEING SUDDENLY SMIT WITH THE DESIRE TO RISE ALSO STUDIED HIS PROFESSION AND HE IS NOW MATE AND PART OWNER OF A FINE FULL RIGGED SHIP
NAY MATE RETURNED BEN NOT YOU YOU'RE A GOOD BOY OR I'M MISTOOK BUT YOU'RE ON'Y A BOY ALL TOLD NOW BEN GUNN IS FLY RUM WOULDN'T BRING ME THERE WHERE YOU'RE GOING NOT RUM WOULDN'T TILL I SEE YOUR BORN GEN'LEMAN
THIS EVEN TINT WAS INDEED BROKEN UP BY STREAKS OF YELLOW SAND BREAK IN THE LOWER LANDS AND BY MANY TALL TREES OF THE PINE FAMILY OUT TOPPING THE OTHERS SOME SINGLY SOME IN CLUMPS BUT THE GENERAL COLOURING WAS UNIFORM AND SAD
YOU NEVER IMAGINED A SWEETER SCHOONER A CHILD MIGHT SAIL HER TWO HUNDRED TONS NAME HISPANIOLA I GOT HER THROUGH MY OLD FRIEND BLANDLY WHO HAS PROVED HIMSELF THROUGHOUT THE MOST SURPRISING TRUMP
FINALLY HE TOOK A WRONG TURN AND RAN A FEW STEPS PAST ME TOWARDS THE HAMLET CRYING
WORTH PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED GUINEAS TO HELP HIM ON HIS FURTHER WANDERINGS I THINK WE WERE ALL PLEASED TO BE SO CHEAPLY QUIT OF HIM
ALL SHINING WITH HEAT WAS LIFTED TO THE OTHER MAN'S IN A KIND OF APPEAL MATE HE WAS SAYING IT'S BECAUSE I THINKS GOLD DUST OF YOU GOLD DUST AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT IF I HADN'T TOOK TO YOU LIKE PITCH
BUT IT'S OVER AND DONE I'LL TAKE HIM IN A LINE WHEN WE GO TREASURE HUNTING FOR WE'LL KEEP HIM LIKE SO MUCH GOLD IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS YOU MARK AND IN THE MEANTIME ONCE WE GOT THE SHIP AND TREASURE BOTH
IT APPEARS THEY WERE AT THEIR WITS END WHAT TO DO THE STORES BEING SO LOW THAT WE MUST HAVE BEEN STARVED INTO SURRENDER LONG BEFORE HELP CAME BUT OUR BEST HOPE IT WAS DECIDED WAS TO KILL OFF THE BUCCANEERS
THE PARTY SPREAD ITSELF ABROAD IN A FAN SHAPE SHOUTING AND LEAPING TO AND FRO ABOUT THE CENTRE AND A GOOD WAY BEHIND THE REST SILVER AND I FOLLOWED I TETHERED BY MY ROPE HE PLOUGHING WITH DEEP PANTS AMONG THE SLIDING GRAVEL FROM TIME TO TIME
AND THIS SET OF CABINS WAS ONLY JOINED TO THE GALLEY AND FORECASTLE BY A SPARRED PASSAGE ON THE PORT SIDE IT HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY MEANT THAT THE CAPTAIN MISTER ARROW HUNTER
NOR NOT NICE SAYS YOU GREAT GUNS MESSMATES BUT IF FLINT WAS LIVING THIS WOULD BE A HOT SPOT FOR YOU AND ME
AND THE DEAR OLD ADMIRAL BENBOW SINCE HE WAS REPAINTED NO LONGER QUITE SO DEAR ONE OF MY LAST THOUGHTS WAS OF THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD SO OFTEN STRODE ALONG THE BEACH WITH HIS COCKED HAT
WHO WAS STILL TERRIBLY AFRAID OF HIS OLD QUARTERMASTER OR MYSELF WHO HAD REALLY SOMETHING TO THANK HIM FOR ALTHOUGH FOR THAT MATTER I SUPPOSE I HAD REASON TO THINK EVEN WORSE OF HIM THAN ANYBODY ELSE
BUT THAT'S A TRIFLE YOU LOOK THERE THAT'S WHY AND HE CAST DOWN UPON THE FLOOR A PAPER THAT I INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED NONE OTHER THAN THE CHART ON YELLOW PAPER
I'M HERE TO GET THAT STUFF AND I'LL NOT BE BEAT BY MAN OR DEVIL I NEVER WAS FEARED OF FLINT IN HIS LIFE AND BY THE POWERS I'LL FACE HIM DEAD
BUT THERE'S ONE THING NOT CLEAR TO ME THERE WAS AN ECHO NOW NO MAN EVER SEEN A SPERRIT WITH A SHADOW WELL THEN WHAT'S HE DOING WITH AN ECHO TO HIM I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT AIN'T IN NATUR SURELY
CHILLED ME THROUGH MY JACKET THE HISPANIOLA STILL LAY WHERE SHE HAD ANCHORED BUT SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS THE JOLLY ROGER THE BLACK FLAG OF PIRACY FLYING FROM HER PEAK EVEN AS I LOOKED THERE CAME ANOTHER RED FLASH
A COMMON MUTINEER AND PIRATE AND THEN YOU CAN GO HANG WELL WELL CAP'N RETURNED THE SEA COOK SITTING DOWN AS HE WAS BIDDEN ON THE SAND YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE ME A HAND UP AGAIN THAT'S ALL A SWEET PRETTY PLACE YOU HAVE OF IT HERE
AND PERHAPS STILL LIVES IN COMFORT WITH HER AND CAPTAIN FLINT IT IS TO BE HOPED SO I SUPPOSE FOR HIS CHANCES OF COMFORT IN ANOTHER WORLD ARE VERY SMALL THE BAR SILVER
BUT GOOD DID COME OF THE APPLE BARREL AS YOU SHALL HEAR FOR IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD NO NOTE OF WARNING AND MIGHT ALL HAVE PERISHED
HAD LIVESEY NOT BEEN HERE I SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOU TO THE DEUCE AS IT IS I HAVE HEARD YOU I WILL DO AS YOU DESIRE BUT I THINK THE WORSE OF YOU
MAYBE ALL WAS SHOOK MAYBE I WAS SHOOK MYSELF MAYBE THAT'S WHY I'M HERE FOR TERMS BUT YOU MARK ME CAP'N IT WON'T DO TWICE BY THUNDER
I WAS PRETTY FAR DOWN ON THE LOW SANDY SPIT THAT ENCLOSES THE ANCHORAGE TO THE EAST AND IS JOINED AT HALF WATER TO SKELETON ISLAND AND NOW AS I ROSE TO MY FEET
INDEED I HAD ALREADY DESERTED MY EASTERN LOOPHOLE AND CREPT UP BEHIND THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD NOW SEATED HIMSELF ON THE THRESHOLD
FOR A GOOD HOUR TO COME FREQUENT REPORTS SHOOK THE ISLAND
BUT I DO KNOW THAT FOR THE NEXT LITTLE WHILE THE WHOLE WORLD SWAM AWAY FROM BEFORE ME IN A WHIRLING MIST SILVER AND THE BIRDS AND THE TALL SPY GLASS HILLTOP GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND TOPSY TURVY BEFORE MY EYES
THAT WAS A GOOD LAY OF YOURS LAST NIGHT I DON'T DENY IT WAS A GOOD LAY
FOR AFTER A DAY OR TWO AT SEA HE BEGAN TO APPEAR ON DECK WITH HAZY EYE RED CHEEKS STUTTERING TONGUE AND OTHER MARKS OF DRUNKENNESS
BOTH WERE TO BE CARRIED ALONG WITH US FOR THE SAKE OF SAFETY AND SO WITH OUR NUMBERS DIVIDED BETWEEN THEM WE SET FORTH UPON THE BOSOM OF THE ANCHORAGE AS WE PULLED OVER THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ON THE CHART
I MOVED FROM HIDING PLACE TO HIDING PLACE ALWAYS PURSUED OR SO IT SEEMED TO ME BY THESE TERRIFYING MISSILES BUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE BOMBARDMENT
BOUT SHIP MATES THIS HERE CREW IS ON A WRONG TACK I DO BELIEVE AND COME TO THINK ON IT IT WAS LIKE FLINT'S VOICE I GRANT YOU BUT
BUT WE ARE NOT SO IGNORANT AS YOU BELIEVE US NEXT YOU SAY YOU DON'T LIKE THE CREW ARE THEY NOT GOOD SEAMEN I DON'T LIKE THEM SIR RETURNED CAPTAIN SMOLLETT
DARTING FURIOUS GLANCES BEHIND THEM ONE THING I OBSERVED WHICH LOOKED WELL FOR US THEY ALL GOT OUT UPON THE OPPOSITE SIDE FROM SILVER WELL THERE WE STOOD TWO ON ONE SIDE FIVE ON THE OTHER THE PIT BETWEEN US
I DON'T LIKE THE MEN AND I DON'T LIKE MY OFFICER THAT'S SHORT AND SWEET PERHAPS SIR YOU DON'T LIKE THE SHIP INQUIRED THE SQUIRE VERY ANGRY AS I COULD SEE
BUT THE PAUSE WAS BRIEF FOR THE BLIND MAN AGAIN ISSUED HIS COMMANDS HIS VOICE SOUNDED LOUDER AND HIGHER AS IF HE WERE AFIRE WITH EAGERNESS AND RAGE IN IN IN HE SHOUTED AND CURSED THEM FOR THEIR DELAY
THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGE SPUN ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM AND FELL ALL HIS LENGTH UPON HIS SIDE WHERE HE LAY DEAD BUT STILL TWITCHING AND THE OTHER THREE TURNED AND RAN FOR IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
THAT THERE'S CROSSES ON THE MAP TO SHOW WHERE TREASURE IS AND THAT THE ISLAND LIES AND THEN HE NAMED THE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE EXACTLY
CAPTAIN SMOLLETT BEGAN THE DOCTOR WITH A SMILE DID EVER YOU HEAR THE FABLE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THE MOUSE YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I DARE SAY
AND A RUSH WAS MADE UPON THE ADMIRAL BENBOW THE LANTERN BEARER FOLLOWING AND THEN I COULD SEE THEM PAUSE AND HEAR SPEECHES PASSED IN A LOWER KEY AS IF THEY WERE SURPRISED TO FIND THE DOOR OPEN
AND KNOCKED OUT THE ASHES OF HIS PIPE IN THE PALM OF HIS LEFT HAND IS THAT ALL HE ASKED EVERY LAST WORD BY THUNDER
AND ANOTHER OF THE CREW STOOD FACE TO FACE IN CONVERSATION THE SUN BEAT FULL UPON THEM SILVER HAD THROWN HIS HAT BESIDE HIM ON THE GROUND AND HIS GREAT SMOOTH BLOND FACE
RATHER INDEED OF GROWING TERROR AT THE IRREVERENCE OF HIS WORDS BELAY THERE JOHN SAID MERRY DON'T YOU CROSS A SPERRIT AND THE REST WERE ALL TOO TERRIFIED TO REPLY
AND THE WORST DREAMS THAT EVER I HAVE ARE WHEN I HEAR THE SURF BOOMING ABOUT ITS COASTS OR START UPRIGHT IN BED WITH THE SHARP VOICE OF CAPTAIN FLINT STILL RINGING IN MY EARS
AND THOUGH NOTHING HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TAKEN AWAY EXCEPT THE CAPTAIN'S MONEY BAG AND A LITTLE SILVER FROM THE TILL I COULD SEE AT ONCE THAT WE WERE RUINED MISTER DANCE COULD MAKE NOTHING OF THE SCENE THEY GOT THE MONEY YOU SAY
UNTIL THEY EITHER HAULED DOWN THEIR FLAG OR RAN AWAY WITH THE HISPANIOLA FROM NINETEEN THEY WERE ALREADY REDUCED TO FIFTEEN TWO OTHERS WERE WOUNDED
AND HIS JAW DROPPED AS THOUGH HE HAD REMEMBERED SOMETHING THE SCORE HE BURST OUT THREE GOES O RUM WHY SHIVER MY TIMBERS IF I HADN'T FORGOTTEN MY SCORE AND FALLING ON A BENCH HE LAUGHED UNTIL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
THE DOCTOR HAD TO GO TO LONDON FOR A PHYSICIAN TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIS PRACTICE THE SQUIRE WAS HARD AT WORK AT BRISTOL AND I LIVED ON AT THE HALL UNDER THE CHARGE OF OLD REDRUTH THE GAMEKEEPER ALMOST A PRISONER
AND WE COULD WADE ASHORE IN SAFETY BUT THERE WERE ALL OUR STORES AT THE BOTTOM AND TO MAKE THINGS WORSE
SHOUT AFTER SHOUT CAME FROM HIM AND THE OTHERS BEGAN TO RUN IN HIS DIRECTION HE CAN'T A FOUND THE TREASURE SAID OLD MORGAN HURRYING PAST US FROM THE RIGHT
A TRIFLE MORE OF THAT MAN HE WOULD SAY AND I SHALL EXPLODE WE HAD SOME HEAVY WEATHER
IT WAS LONG ERE I COULD CLOSE AN EYE AND HEAVEN KNOWS I HAD MATTER ENOUGH FOR THOUGHT IN THE MAN WHOM I HAD SLAIN THAT AFTERNOON
WITH A HEAD SEA HE DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY AND WAS SEEN NO MORE OVERBOARD SAID THE CAPTAIN WELL GENTLEMEN
WOULD NOT MY ABSENCE ITSELF BE AN EVIDENCE TO THEM OF MY ALARM AND THEREFORE OF MY FATAL KNOWLEDGE IT WAS ALL OVER I THOUGHT
TILL THE MOST REMARKABLE STROKE OF FORTUNE BROUGHT ME THE VERY MAN THAT I REQUIRED I WAS STANDING ON THE DOCK WHEN BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT I FELL IN TALK WITH HIM I FOUND HE WAS AN OLD SAILOR KEPT A PUBLIC HOUSE
AND A FEW BEING GOOD FELLOWS IN THE MAIN COULD NEITHER BE LED NOR DRIVEN ANY FURTHER IT IS ONE THING TO BE IDLE AND SKULK AND QUITE ANOTHER TO TAKE A SHIP AND MURDER A NUMBER OF INNOCENT MEN AT LAST HOWEVER THE PARTY WAS MADE UP
RUNNING WESTWARD THROUGH THE BASIN AND THEN SOUTH'ARD AND SEAWARD DOWN THE STRAITS BY WHICH WE HAD ENTERED IN THE MORNING EVEN THE RIPPLES WERE A DANGER TO OUR OVERLOADED CRAFT
AND YOU'VE MONEY TOO WHICH LOTS OF POOR SAILORS HASN'T AND YOU'RE BRAVE OR I'M MISTOOK
THIS APPEAL SEEMED TO PRODUCE SOME EFFECT FOR TWO OF THE FELLOWS BEGAN TO LOOK HERE AND THERE AMONG THE LUMBER BUT HALF HEARTEDLY I THOUGHT AND WITH HALF AN EYE TO THEIR OWN DANGER ALL THE TIME WHILE THE REST STOOD IRRESOLUTE ON THE ROAD
WHO COULD BE TRUSTED AT A PINCH WITH ALMOST ANYTHING HE WAS A GREAT CONFIDANT OF LONG JOHN SILVER AND SO THE MENTION OF HIS NAME
NOT YOU AS SURE AS GOD SEES ME I'D SOONER LOSE MY HAND IF I TURN AGIN MY DOOTY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A NOISE I HAD FOUND ONE OF THE HONEST HANDS WELL
AND AS IT WAS WHAT WITH BAFFLING WINDS AND A COUPLE OF FRESH GALES WE WERE ALL WORN OUT BEFORE WE REACHED IT IT WAS JUST AT SUNDOWN WHEN WE CAST ANCHOR IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL LAND LOCKED GULF
FOR SOON I HEARD THE VERY DISTANT AND LOW TONES OF A HUMAN VOICE WHICH AS I CONTINUED TO GIVE EAR GREW STEADILY LOUDER AND NEARER THIS PUT ME IN A GREAT FEAR AND I CRAWLED UNDER COVER OF THE NEAREST LIVE OAK AND SQUATTED THERE
JUST TAKE A BEARING WILL YOU ALONG THE LINE OF THEM BONES IT WAS DONE THE BODY POINTED STRAIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ISLAND AND THE COMPASS READ DULY E S
SAID HE NOTHIN LEFT IT'S THESE PEOPLE OF THE INN IT'S THAT BOY I WISH I HAD PUT HIS EYES OUT CRIED THE BLIND MAN PEW
A COUNCIL WAS HELD AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE MUST DESERT THEM ON THE ISLAND TO THE HUGE GLEE I MUST SAY OF BEN GUNN AND WITH THE STRONG APPROVAL OF GRAY WE LEFT A GOOD STOCK OF POWDER AND SHOT THE BULK OF THE SALT GOAT
DOUBLE GROG WAS GOING ON THE LEAST EXCUSE THERE WAS DUFF ON ODD DAYS AS FOR INSTANCE IF THE SQUIRE HEARD IT WAS ANY MAN'S BIRTHDAY AND ALWAYS A BARREL OF APPLES STANDING BROACHED IN THE WAIST
WHEN DID EVER A GENTLEMAN O FORTUNE SHOW HIS STERN TO THAT MUCH DOLLARS FOR A BOOZY OLD SEAMAN WITH A BLUE MUG AND HIM DEAD TOO BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF REAWAKENING COURAGE IN HIS FOLLOWERS
WELL GENTLEMEN CONTINUED THE CAPTAIN I DON'T KNOW WHO HAS THIS MAP BUT I MAKE IT A POINT IT SHALL BE KEPT SECRET EVEN FROM ME AND MISTER ARROW
ERE WE WERE HALF WAY OVER LONG JOHN ALONE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND BIDDING THEM WAIT TILL THEY WERE THERE WE PULLED EASILY BY SILVER'S DIRECTIONS NOT TO WEARY THE HANDS PREMATURELY AND AFTER QUITE A LONG PASSAGE
BUT I SOON OBSERVED THAT THINGS WERE NOT THE SAME BETWEEN MISTER TRELAWNEY AND THE CAPTAIN THIS LAST WAS A SHARP LOOKING MAN WHO SEEMED ANGRY WITH EVERYTHING ON BOARD
SAID CAPTAIN SMOLLETT I WAS DEAD TIRED AS YOU MAY FANCY AND WHEN I GOT TO SLEEP
SO THAT'S THE TOON IS IT CRIED THE COOK GEORGE I RECKON YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER TURN FRIEND AND LUCKY FOR YOU AS I'M NOT A REVENGEFUL MAN BUT
JUST THEN A MAN HAILED US FROM THE FIRE THAT BREAKFAST WAS READY AND WE WERE SOON SEATED HERE AND THERE ABOUT THE SAND OVER BISCUIT AND FRIED JUNK
HERE'S THIS POOR OLD INNOCENT BIRD O MINE SWEARING BLUE FIRE AND NONE THE WISER YOU MAY LAY TO THAT SHE WOULD SWEAR THE SAME IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING BEFORE CHAPLAIN
AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD OVER IT AND TOLD US WE MUST GET BACK TO THIS TOMORROW RATHER LIVELIER THEN WHEN WE HAD EATEN OUR PORK AND EACH HAD A GOOD STIFF GLASS OF BRANDY GROG THE THREE CHIEFS GOT TOGETHER IN A CORNER TO DISCUSS OUR PROSPECTS
IN THE MEANTIME THE SUPERVISOR RODE ON AS FAST AS HE COULD TO KITT'S HOLE BUT HIS MEN HAD TO DISMOUNT AND GROPE DOWN THE DINGLE LEADING AND SOMETIMES SUPPORTING THEIR HORSES AND IN CONTINUAL FEAR OF AMBUSHES
ONLY WHERE THE STREAMLET RAN DOWN FROM THE KETTLE
BUT YOU REMIND ME OF THAT FABLE WHEN YOU CAME IN HERE I'LL STAKE MY WIG YOU MEANT MORE THAN THIS DOCTOR SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU ARE SMART
THE ADMIRABLE FELLOW LITERALLY SLAVED IN MY INTEREST AND SO I MAY SAY DID EVERYONE IN BRISTOL AS SOON AS THEY GOT WIND OF THE PORT WE SAILED FOR TREASURE I MEAN REDRUTH SAID I INTERRUPTING THE LETTER
BEN GUNN'S NOT HERE IN THE BODY ANY MORE'N FLINT BUT THE OLDER HANDS GREETED THIS REMARK WITH SCORN WHY NOBODY MINDS BEN GUNN CRIED MERRY DEAD OR ALIVE NOBODY MINDS HIM
THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD SO LONG BEEN A CAUSE OF SO MUCH DISCOMFORT WAS GONE WHERE THE WICKED CEASE FROM TROUBLING THE SQUIRE HAD HAD EVERYTHING REPAIRED AND THE PUBLIC ROOMS AND THE SIGN REPAINTED
I MADE A HASH O THIS CRUISE DID I WELL NOW YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I WANTED AND YOU ALL KNOW IF THAT HAD BEEN DONE THAT WE'D A BEEN ABOARD THE HISPANIOLA THIS NIGHT AS EVER WAS EVERY MAN OF US ALIVE AND FIT AND FULL OF GOOD PLUM DUFF
HE HAD TAKEN A DOWNRIGHT FANCY TO HER SHE'LL LIE A POINT NEARER THE WIND THAN A MAN HAS A RIGHT TO EXPECT OF HIS OWN MARRIED WIFE SIR BUT HE WOULD ADD ALL I SAY IS
AND THE TREASURE IN THE HOLD OF HER BY THUNDER WELL WHO CROSSED ME
WE'RE A CHANGING OF THE POWDER JACK ANSWERS ONE WHY BY THE POWERS CRIED LONG JOHN IF WE DO WE'LL MISS THE MORNING TIDE
YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON THOUSANDS YOU FOOLS AND YOU HANG A LEG YOU'D BE AS RICH AS KINGS IF YOU COULD FIND IT AND YOU KNOW IT'S HERE AND YOU STAND THERE SKULKING THERE WASN'T ONE OF YOU DARED FACE BILL
AND WHAT A MEAL IT WAS WITH BEN GUNN'S SALTED GOAT AND SOME DELICACIES AND A BOTTLE OF OLD WINE FROM THE HISPANIOLA NEVER I AM SURE WERE PEOPLE GAYER OR HAPPIER
J T YOU CAN FANCY THE EXCITEMENT INTO WHICH THAT LETTER PUT ME I WAS HALF BESIDE MYSELF WITH GLEE
SPEAK UP TO THE OTHERS AH THE OTHERS RETURNED JOHN THEY'RE A NICE LOT AIN'T THEY YOU SAY THIS CRUISE IS BUNGLED AH BY GUM IF YOU COULD UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT'S BUNGLED YOU WOULD SEE
TOO CLOSE FOR DEFENCE THEY SAID THE WOOD STILL FLOURISHED HIGH AND DENSE ALL OF FIR ON THE LAND SIDE BUT TOWARDS THE SEA WITH A LARGE ADMIXTURE OF LIVE OAKS THE COLD EVENING BREEZE OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN
HERE AT THAT SAME MOMENT CAME NEWS OF ANOTHER FAR AWAY OUT IN THE MARSH THERE AROSE ALL OF A SUDDEN A SOUND LIKE THE CRY OF ANGER THEN ANOTHER ON THE BACK OF IT AND THEN ONE HORRID LONG DRAWN SCREAM
E S E AND BY E TEN FEET A TALL TREE WAS THUS THE PRINCIPAL MARK NOW RIGHT BEFORE US THE ANCHORAGE WAS BOUNDED BY A PLATEAU FROM TWO TO THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH
BUT THE SLIGHT IF THERE BE ONE WAS UNINTENTIONAL AND YOU DON'T LIKE MISTER ARROW I DON'T SIR I BELIEVE HE'S A GOOD SEAMAN BUT HE'S TOO FREE WITH THE CREW TO BE A GOOD OFFICER
SECOND POINT ANY MORE ASKED MISTER TRELAWNEY ONE MORE SAID THE CAPTAIN THERE'S BEEN TOO MUCH BLABBING ALREADY
AND JOHN WOULD TOUCH HIS FORELOCK WITH A SOLEMN WAY HE HAD THAT MADE ME THINK HE WAS THE BEST OF MEN
HE SEEMED TO ME TO GIVE SOMETHING ALMOST LIKE A START OH SAID HE QUITE LOUD AND OFFERING HIS HAND I SEE YOU ARE OUR NEW CABIN BOY PLEASED I AM TO SEE YOU
BEN IN HIS LONG LONELY WANDERINGS ABOUT THE ISLAND HAD FOUND THE SKELETON IT WAS HE THAT HAD RIFLED IT HE HAD FOUND THE TREASURE HE HAD DUG IT UP IT WAS THE HAFT OF HIS PICK AXE THAT LAY BROKEN IN THE EXCAVATION
GIVE WAY THEN CRIED THE CAPTAIN WE MUSTN'T MIND IF WE SWAMP HER NOW IF WE CAN'T GET ASHORE ALL'S UP ONLY ONE OF THE GIGS IS BEING MANNED SIR
HE CURSED LIKE A MADMAN WHEN THE FLIES SETTLED ON HIS HOT AND SHINY COUNTENANCE HE PLUCKED FURIOUSLY AT THE LINE THAT HELD ME TO HIM AND FROM TIME TO TIME TURNED HIS EYES UPON ME WITH A DEADLY LOOK CERTAINLY HE TOOK NO PAINS TO HIDE HIS THOUGHTS AND CERTAINLY I READ THEM LIKE PRINT
THE BOOMS WERE TEARING AT THE BLOCKS THE RUDDER WAS BANGING TO AND FRO AND THE WHOLE SHIP CREAKING GROANING AND JUMPING LIKE A MANUFACTORY
A HEAVY SCENTED BROOM AND MANY FLOWERING SHRUBS HAD ALMOST TAKEN THE PLACE OF GRASS THICKETS OF GREEN NUTMEG TREES WERE DOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH THE RED COLUMNS AND THE BROAD SHADOW OF THE PINES AND THE FIRST
WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FIRST THAT HAD EVER ANCHORED THERE SINCE THE ISLAND AROSE OUT OF THE SEAS THERE WAS NOT A BREATH OF AIR MOVING NOR A SOUND BUT THAT OF THE SURF BOOMING HALF A MILE AWAY ALONG THE BEACHES AND AGAINST THE ROCKS OUTSIDE
BUT INDEED I DID NOT WISH YOU A PLEASANT WALK I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING BUT I BEGGED MISTER THORPE SO EARNESTLY TO STOP I CALLED OUT TO HIM AS SOON AS EVER I SAW YOU NOW MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT OH YOU WERE NOT THERE BUT INDEED I DID AND IF MISTER THORPE WOULD ONLY HAVE STOPPED
THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACK
AND DROWN HER IN TEARS FOR THE LAST DAY OR TWO OF THEIR BEING TOGETHER AND ADVICE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND APPLICABLE NATURE MUST OF COURSE FLOW FROM HER WISE LIPS IN THEIR PARTING CONFERENCE IN HER CLOSET
THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE LIKE ME I DARE SAY ONLY A GREAT DEAL BETTER GOOD MORNING TO YOU BUT I SAY MISS MORLAND I SHALL COME AND PAY MY RESPECTS AT FULLERTON BEFORE IT IS LONG IF NOT DISAGREEABLE PRAY DO
CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE
FROM EVEN LOOKING HIS SURPRISE BY HIS FATHER'S ENTRANCE THEY WENT TO BREAKFAST DIRECTLY BUT CATHERINE COULD HARDLY EAT ANYTHING TEARS FILLED HER EYES AND EVEN RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS AS SHE SAT THE LETTER WAS ONE MOMENT IN HER HAND
HER MOTHER COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THEM NOW TO BE GREATLY INCREASED SHE COULD NEITHER SIT STILL NOR EMPLOY HERSELF FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER WALKING ROUND THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF NOTHING BUT MOTION WAS VOLUNTARY
I DIE TO SEE HIM MISTER MORLAND YOU ARE NOT TO LISTEN WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS WHISPERING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE NOW I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE
WITH THE NATURAL BLUSH OF SO NEW AN EMOTION SHE CRIED OUT GOOD HEAVEN MY DEAR ISABELLA WHAT DO YOU MEAN CAN YOU CAN YOU REALLY BE IN LOVE WITH JAMES THIS BOLD SURMISE HOWEVER SHE SOON LEARNT COMPREHENDED BUT HALF THE FACT
THERE SUCH AS WERE NOT AS SPOTLESS AS AN ANGEL MIGHT HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF A FIEND BUT IN ENGLAND IT WAS NOT SO AMONG THE ENGLISH SHE BELIEVED IN THEIR HEARTS AND HABITS
I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN HILL TOMORROW THANK YOU BUT WILL NOT YOUR HORSE WANT REST REST HE HAS ONLY COME THREE AND TWENTY MILES TODAY ALL NONSENSE NOTHING RUINS HORSES SO MUCH AS REST NOTHING KNOCKS THEM UP SO SOON
HAD BEEN OPEN AND BOLD THE GENERAL ACCUSTOMED ON EVERY ORDINARY OCCASION TO GIVE THE LAW IN HIS FAMILY PREPARED FOR NO RELUCTANCE BUT OF FEELING
HATED CONFINEMENT AND CLEANLINESS AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN AT FIFTEEN APPEARANCES WERE MENDING
AND IN NOT ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER AND SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN THE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED AND THOUGH SHE HAD
BUT SHE LEARNED TO HOPE THAT IT WOULD NEVER TRANSPIRE FARTHER AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT COST HER HENRY'S ENTIRE REGARD HER THOUGHTS BEING STILL CHIEFLY FIXED ON WHAT SHE HAD WITH SUCH CAUSELESS TERROR FELT AND DONE NOTHING COULD SHORTLY BE CLEARER
TO FEEL HERSELF AT A BALL SHE LONGED TO DANCE BUT SHE HAD NOT AN ACQUAINTANCE IN THE ROOM MISSUS ALLEN DID ALL THAT SHE COULD DO IN SUCH A CASE BY SAYING VERY PLACIDLY EVERY NOW AND THEN
AND A BRILLIANT EXHIBITION OF HOOP RINGS ON HER FINGER WHEN THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER WERE ASCERTAINED JOHN THORPE WHO HAD ONLY WAITED ITS ARRIVAL TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TO LONDON PREPARED TO SET OFF WELL MISS MORLAND
AS HER FANCY REPRESENTED BLAIZE CASTLE TO BE WAS SUCH A COUNTERPOISE OF GOOD AS MIGHT CONSOLE HER FOR ALMOST ANYTHING THEY PASSED BRISKLY DOWN PULTENEY STREET AND THROUGH LAURA PLACE WITHOUT THE EXCHANGE OF MANY WORDS
WERE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BY A LADY AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS THORPE
FIDELITY AND COMPLAISANCE ARE THE PRINCIPAL DUTIES OF BOTH AND THOSE MEN WHO DO NOT CHOOSE TO DANCE OR MARRY THEMSELVES HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH THE PARTNERS OR WIVES OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THEY ARE SUCH VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
WHAT I SAY IS WHY SHOULD A BROTHER'S HAPPINESS BE DEARER TO ME THAN A FRIEND'S YOU KNOW I CARRY MY NOTIONS OF FRIENDSHIP PRETTY HIGH
AND DEPENDENCE ON CATHERINE'S HONOUR OH DO NOT SAY MISS TILNEY WAS NOT ANGRY CRIED CATHERINE BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WAS FOR SHE WOULD NOT SEE ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CALLED I SAW HER WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE THE NEXT MINUTE AFTER MY LEAVING IT I WAS HURT BUT I WAS NOT AFFRONTED
CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY
I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
HOW OLD FASHIONED IT IS LOOK AT THE BACK AFTER SOME TIME THEY RECEIVED AN OFFER OF TEA FROM ONE OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS IT WAS THANKFULLY ACCEPTED AND THIS INTRODUCED A LIGHT CONVERSATION WITH THE GENTLEMAN WHO OFFERED IT
AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
WAS RATHER TALL HAD A PLEASING COUNTENANCE A VERY INTELLIGENT AND LIVELY EYE AND IF NOT QUITE HANDSOME WAS VERY NEAR IT HIS ADDRESS WAS GOOD
ARE YOU NOT CARRIED A LITTLE TOO FAR WOULD HE THANK YOU EITHER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT OR MISS THORPE'S FOR SUPPOSING THAT HER AFFECTION OR AT LEAST HER GOOD BEHAVIOUR IS ONLY TO BE SECURED BY HER SEEING NOTHING OF CAPTAIN TILNEY
WE CAN OFFER YOU NOTHING LIKE THE GAIETIES OF THIS LIVELY PLACE WE CAN TEMPT YOU NEITHER BY AMUSEMENT NOR SPLENDOUR FOR OUR MODE OF LIVING AS YOU SEE IS PLAIN AND UNPRETENDING
HOW WELL YOUR BROTHER DANCES WAS AN ARTLESS EXCLAMATION OF CATHERINE'S TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THEIR CONVERSATION WHICH AT ONCE SURPRISED AND AMUSED HER COMPANION HENRY SHE REPLIED WITH A SMILE YES HE DOES DANCE VERY WELL
IT IS THIS DELIGHTFUL HABIT OF JOURNALING WHICH LARGELY CONTRIBUTES TO FORM THE EASY STYLE OF WRITING FOR WHICH LADIES ARE SO GENERALLY CELEBRATED
AND HIS OWN VIEWS ON ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH HE BOASTED WITH ALMOST EQUAL OPENNESS SEEMED SUFFICIENT VOUCHERS FOR HIS TRUTH AND TO THESE WERE ADDED THE ABSOLUTE FACTS OF THE ALLENS BEING WEALTHY AND CHILDLESS
CATHERINE CHEERFULLY COMPLIED AND BEING PROPERLY EQUIPPED WAS MORE IMPATIENT THAN EVER TO BE AT THE PUMP ROOM THAT SHE MIGHT INFORM HERSELF OF GENERAL TILNEY'S LODGINGS FOR THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE HOUSE
WHAT CAN HE WRITE ABOUT BUT YOURSELF YOU KNOW HE IS OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WITH YOU WITH ME DEAR ISABELLA NAY MY SWEETEST CATHERINE THIS IS BEING QUITE ABSURD
HIS DEPARTURE GAVE CATHERINE THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL CONVICTION THAT A LOSS MAY BE SOMETIMES A GAIN THE HAPPINESS WITH WHICH THEIR TIME NOW PASSED EVERY EMPLOYMENT VOLUNTARY EVERY LAUGH INDULGED
HE NEVER COMES TO THE PUMP ROOM I SUPPOSE YES SOMETIMES BUT HE HAS RID OUT THIS MORNING WITH MY FATHER MISSUS HUGHES NOW JOINED THEM AND ASKED MISS TILNEY IF SHE WAS READY TO GO
SHE WAS LOOKED AT HOWEVER AND WITH SOME ADMIRATION FOR IN HER OWN HEARING TWO GENTLEMEN PRONOUNCED HER TO BE A PRETTY GIRL SUCH WORDS HAD THEIR DUE EFFECT
HOW SURPRISED I WAS TO SEE HIM AGAIN I FELT SO SURE OF HIS BEING QUITE GONE AWAY
AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO AND THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A FAGGOT HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE SOME OTHER PLACES I DO NOT KNOW THAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
WILL BE NATURALLY SUPPOSED TO BE MOST SEVERE A THOUSAND ALARMING PRESENTIMENTS OF EVIL TO HER BELOVED CATHERINE FROM THIS TERRIFIC SEPARATION MUST OPPRESS HER HEART WITH SADNESS
AND TURNING ROUND PERCEIVED MISSUS HUGHES DIRECTLY BEHIND HER ATTENDED BY MISS TILNEY AND A GENTLEMAN I BEG YOUR PARDON MISS MORLAND SAID SHE FOR THIS LIBERTY BUT I CANNOT ANYHOW GET TO MISS THORPE
MISS TILNEY CONTINUING SILENT SHE VENTURED TO SAY HER DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT AFFLICTION A GREAT AND INCREASING ONE REPLIED THE OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
BEFORE THE DELIVERY OF THE LETTERS A NEEDFUL EXERTION FOR AS THE TIME OF REASONABLE EXPECTATION DREW NEAR ISABELLA BECAME MORE AND MORE DESPONDING AND BEFORE THE LETTER ARRIVED HAD WORKED HERSELF INTO A STATE OF REAL DISTRESS
WHAT IS MOST TO THE CREDIT OF HUMAN NATURE SUCH FEELINGS OUGHT TO BE INVESTIGATED THAT THEY MAY KNOW THEMSELVES
SHE WAS EXPECTING HER SISTERS EVERY MOMENT SO THAT HER DEAREST CATHERINE MUST EXCUSE HER AND MUST SIT QUIETLY DOWN AGAIN BUT CATHERINE COULD BE STUBBORN TOO AND MISSUS ALLEN JUST THEN COMING UP TO PROPOSE THEIR RETURNING HOME
WHISPERED CATHERINE DETACHING HER FRIEND FROM JAMES IT IS MISTER TILNEY'S SISTER
THOUGH GOD KNOWS WITH LITTLE INCLINATION FOR WRITING I THINK IT MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS AT AN END BETWEEN MISS THORPE AND ME I LEFT HER AND BATH YESTERDAY NEVER TO SEE EITHER AGAIN
IT IS ALL OVER WITH FREDERICK INDEED HE IS A DECEASED MAN DEFUNCT IN UNDERSTANDING PREPARE FOR YOUR SISTER IN LAW ELEANOR AND SUCH A SISTER IN LAW AS YOU MUST DELIGHT IN OPEN CANDID
HER MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF USEFUL PLAIN SENSE WITH A GOOD TEMPER AND WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE WITH A GOOD CONSTITUTION SHE HAD THREE SONS BEFORE CATHERINE WAS BORN
AND ESPECIALLY AS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE VERY FAMILY WE ARE JUST GOT SO INTIMATE WITH ARE HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS ALREADY OH WHO CAN EVER BE TIRED OF BATH NOT THOSE WHO BRING SUCH FRESH FEELINGS OF EVERY SORT TO IT AS YOU DO
AND SO I AM AT HOME ONLY I DO NOT FIND SO MUCH OF IT I WALK ABOUT HERE AND SO I DO THERE BUT HERE I SEE A VARIETY OF PEOPLE IN EVERY STREET AND THERE I CAN ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN
IMMEDIATELY RUSHED ACROSS HER AND THOUGH THERE COULD BE NOTHING REALLY IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHIMSICAL IT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE SHE TOOK HER CANDLE AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE CABINET IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY EBONY AND GOLD
I HAVE MYSELF TOLD HIM THAT MISS THORPE IS ENGAGED HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT AND MUST BE HIS OWN MASTER NO HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT CRIED CATHERINE HE DOES NOT KNOW THE PAIN HE IS GIVING MY BROTHER
AND CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY TOOK HER USUAL PLACE BY THE SIDE OF HER FRIEND JAMES WHO WAS NOW IN CONSTANT ATTENDANCE MAINTAINED A SIMILAR POSITION AND SEPARATING THEMSELVES FROM THE REST OF THEIR PARTY THEY WALKED IN THAT MANNER FOR SOME TIME
BEFORE A LADY OF ABOUT HER OWN AGE WHO WAS SITTING BY HER AND HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER ATTENTIVELY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES ADDRESSED HER WITH GREAT COMPLAISANCE IN THESE WORDS
WHAT COULD THEY HAVE TO SAY OF HER SHE FEARED GENERAL TILNEY DID NOT LIKE HER APPEARANCE SHE FOUND IT WAS IMPLIED IN HIS PREVENTING HER ADMITTANCE TO HIS DAUGHTER RATHER THAN POSTPONE HIS OWN WALK A FEW MINUTES HOW CAME MISTER THORPE TO KNOW YOUR FATHER WAS HER ANXIOUS INQUIRY
AND DO NOT LET US PUT IT OFF LET US GO TOMORROW THIS WAS READILY AGREED TO WITH ONLY A PROVISO OF MISS TILNEY'S THAT IT DID NOT RAIN WHICH CATHERINE WAS SURE IT WOULD NOT AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THEY WERE TO CALL FOR HER IN PULTENEY STREET AND REMEMBER
SO IT IS IN VAIN TO AFFECT IGNORANCE
BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN HOW WERE MISTER ALLEN'S SUCCESSION HOUSES WORKED DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM MISTER ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT HOUSE WHICH MISSUS ALLEN HAD THE USE OF FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN
AS SHE POINTED THEM OUT TO HER COMPANION HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT HIS FATHER LIKE EVERY MILITARY MAN
HER ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA JAMES HAD PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD AND MISSUS ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO FULLERTON
THAT THOUGH CATHERINE'S SUPPORTING OPINION WAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY CALLED FOR BY ONE OR THE OTHER SHE WAS NEVER ABLE TO GIVE ANY
WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED WITH GREAT KINDNESS BY MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN INVITED BY THE FORMER TO DINE WITH THEM AND SUMMONED BY THE LATTER TO GUESS THE PRICE AND WEIGH THE MERITS OF A NEW MUFF AND TIPPET A PRE ENGAGEMENT IN EDGAR'S BUILDINGS
HOW CAN YOU SAID CATHERINE LAUGHING BE SO SHE HAD ALMOST SAID STRANGE
SHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEM
THORPE TALKED TO HIS HORSE AND SHE MEDITATED BY TURNS ON BROKEN PROMISES AND BROKEN ARCHES PHAETONS AND FALSE HANGINGS TILNEYS AND TRAP DOORS AS THEY ENTERED ARGYLE BUILDINGS HOWEVER SHE WAS ROUSED BY THIS ADDRESS FROM HER COMPANION
OH BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN THERE SO LONG NAY IF YOU CAN USE SUCH A WORD I CAN URGE YOU NO FARTHER IF YOU THINK IT LONG OH NO I DO NOT INDEED
THE AGREEABLENESS THE COMPLIANCE ARE EXPECTED FROM HIM WHILE SHE FURNISHES THE FAN AND THE LAVENDER WATER THAT I SUPPOSE WAS THE DIFFERENCE OF DUTIES WHICH STRUCK YOU AS RENDERING THE CONDITIONS INCAPABLE OF COMPARISON
NEATNESS AND FASHION ARE ENOUGH FOR THE FORMER AND A SOMETHING OF SHABBINESS OR IMPROPRIETY WILL BE MOST ENDEARING TO THE LATTER BUT NOT ONE OF THESE GRAVE REFLECTIONS TROUBLED THE TRANQUILLITY OF CATHERINE
THE ENGAGEMENTS OF HIS CURATE AT WOODSTON OBLIGING HIM TO LEAVE THEM ON SATURDAY
TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN THE GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN RESTORED HER TO PEACE THE DINING PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM
AND I DEFY ANY MAN IN ENGLAND TO MAKE MY HORSE GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR IN HARNESS THAT MAKES IT EXACTLY TWENTY FIVE YOU HAVE LOST AN HOUR SAID MORLAND IT WAS ONLY TEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE CAME FROM TETBURY TEN O'CLOCK
FREDERICK WILL NOT BE THE FIRST MAN WHO HAS CHOSEN A WIFE WITH LESS SENSE THAN HIS FAMILY EXPECTED I DO NOT ENVY HIS SITUATION EITHER AS A LOVER OR A SON MISS TILNEY
MY TWO YOUNGER SISTERS AND THEIR PARTNERS I HAVE BEEN LAUGHING AT THEM THIS HALF HOUR AGAIN CATHERINE EXCUSED HERSELF AND AT LAST HE WALKED OFF TO QUIZ HIS SISTERS BY HIMSELF THE REST OF THE EVENING SHE FOUND VERY DULL
SHE NOW PLAINLY SAW THAT SHE MUST NOT EXPECT A MANUSCRIPT OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE GENERALITY OF WHAT SHE HAD SHUDDERED OVER IN BOOKS FOR THE ROLL SEEMING TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF SMALL DISJOINTED SHEETS WAS ALTOGETHER BUT OF TRIFLING SIZE
IN ADDITION TO WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID OF CATHERINE MORLAND'S PERSONAL AND MENTAL ENDOWMENTS WHEN ABOUT TO BE LAUNCHED INTO ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS OF A SIX WEEKS RESIDENCE IN BATH
HER HEART INSTANTANEOUSLY AT EASE ON THIS POINT SHE RESOLVED TO LOSE NO TIME IN PARTICULAR EXAMINATION OF ANYTHING AS SHE GREATLY DREADED DISOBLIGING THE GENERAL BY ANY DELAY
NORTHANGER ABBEY
AND I HAVE ALMOST BROKE MY ARM WITH PULLING HIM IN TO THAT CURSED BROKEN WINDED JADE'S PACE MORLAND IS A FOOL FOR NOT KEEPING A HORSE AND GIG OF HIS OWN NO HE IS NOT SAID CATHERINE WARMLY
IT WAS TO CATHERINE THE MOST SURPRISING INSENSIBILITY THE DISCLOSURE HOWEVER OF THE GREAT SECRET OF JAMES'S GOING TO FULLERTON THE DAY BEFORE DID RAISE SOME EMOTION IN MISSUS ALLEN SHE COULD NOT LISTEN TO THAT WITH PERFECT CALMNESS
AND HIS ASSERTION OF THE OFFER AND OF HER ENCOURAGEMENT CONVINCED HER THAT HIS MISTAKES COULD SOMETIMES BE VERY EGREGIOUS IN VANITY THEREFORE
MISS TILNEY HAD A GOOD FIGURE A PRETTY FACE AND A VERY AGREEABLE COUNTENANCE AND HER AIR THOUGH IT HAD NOT ALL THE DECIDED PRETENSION THE RESOLUTE STYLISHNESS OF MISS THORPE'S HAD MORE REAL ELEGANCE
I HATE THE IDEA OF ONE GREAT FORTUNE LOOKING OUT FOR ANOTHER AND TO MARRY FOR MONEY I THINK THE WICKEDEST THING IN EXISTENCE GOOD DAY
TO SHOW HER RESENTMENT TOWARDS HIM WHO COULD HARBOUR A DOUBT OF IT TO LEAVE TO HIM ALL THE TROUBLE OF SEEKING AN EXPLANATION AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIM ON THE PAST ONLY BY AVOIDING HIS SIGHT OR FLIRTING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE SHAME OF MISCONDUCT
NO OPPOSING DESIRE THAT SHOULD DARE TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN WORDS COULD ILL BROOK THE OPPOSITION OF HIS SON STEADY AS THE SANCTION OF REASON AND THE DICTATE OF CONSCIENCE COULD MAKE IT BUT IN SUCH A CAUSE HIS ANGER
SHE WAS UPON THE WHOLE LEFT ONE OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD WHILE TALKING TO EACH OTHER
PERCEIVING HER STILL TO LOOK DOUBTFUL AND GRAVE HE ADDED THOUGH FREDERICK DOES NOT LEAVE BATH WITH US HE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN BUT A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS ONLY A FEW DAYS BEHIND US
LOOK AT HIS LOINS ONLY SEE HOW HE MOVES THAT HORSE CANNOT GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR TIE HIS LEGS AND HE WILL GET ON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY GIG MISS MORLAND
WERE FELT AND CONSIDERED WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EMOTION AND THOUGH THE WIND WAS HIGH AND OFTEN PRODUCED STRANGE AND SUDDEN NOISES THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE SHE HEARD IT ALL AS SHE LAY AWAKE HOUR AFTER HOUR WITHOUT CURIOSITY OR TERROR
AND ALL OUR AGREEABLENESS BELONGS SOLELY TO EACH OTHER FOR THAT TIME NOBODY CAN FASTEN THEMSELVES ON THE NOTICE OF ONE WITHOUT INJURING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER I CONSIDER A COUNTRY DANCE AS AN EMBLEM OF MARRIAGE
YOU ARE TO THANK YOUR BROTHER AND ME FOR THE SCHEME IT DARTED INTO OUR HEADS AT BREAKFAST TIME I VERILY BELIEVE AT THE SAME INSTANT AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFF TWO HOURS AGO IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS DETESTABLE RAIN BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE NIGHTS ARE MOONLIGHT AND WE SHALL DO DELIGHTFULLY
HE ASKED FIFTY GUINEAS I CLOSED WITH HIM DIRECTLY THREW DOWN THE MONEY AND THE CARRIAGE WAS MINE AND I AM SURE SAID CATHERINE
I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN CAMILLA YES
AND THEY PRETENDED TO BE QUITE SURPRISED TO SEE ME OUT I KNEW THEIR SPITE AT ONE TIME THEY COULD NOT BE CIVIL TO ME BUT NOW THEY ARE ALL FRIENDSHIP BUT I AM NOT SUCH A FOOL AS TO BE TAKEN IN BY THEM
AND THANKFUL FOR MISTER THORPE'S COMMUNICATION HE ALMOST INSTANTLY DETERMINED TO SPARE NO PAINS IN WEAKENING HIS BOASTED INTEREST AND RUINING HIS DEAREST HOPES
AFTER PARADING THE ROOM TILL THEY WERE TIRED AND HOW PLEASANT IT WOULD BE IF WE HAD ANY ACQUAINTANCE HERE
YES MY DEAR REPLIED MISSUS ALLEN WITH PERFECT SERENITY IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE INDEED
ON MISSUS ALLEN'S BOSOM CATHERINE SAT ERECT IN THE PERFECT USE OF HER SENSES AND WITH CHEEKS ONLY A LITTLE REDDER THAN USUAL MISTER TILNEY AND HIS COMPANION WHO CONTINUED THOUGH SLOWLY TO APPROACH
MADE HIS FRIEND PULL UP TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER THE OTHERS THEN CAME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR CONVERSATION AND MORLAND SAID WE HAD BETTER GO BACK THORPE IT IS TOO LATE TO GO ON TODAY
FOR GENERAL TILNEY WAS PACING THE DRAWING ROOM HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND AND HAVING ON THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR ENTERING PULLED THE BELL WITH VIOLENCE ORDERED DINNER TO BE ON TABLE DIRECTLY CATHERINE TREMBLED AT THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE
IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST OLD PLACES IN ENGLAND I UNDERSTAND I SHALL DEPEND UPON A MOST PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF IT YOU SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE THE BEST IN MY POWER TO GIVE BUT WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ARE YOUR SISTERS COMING
DID HENRY'S INCOME DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS LIVING HE WOULD NOT BE ILL PROVIDED FOR PERHAPS IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN I SHOULD THINK ANY PROFESSION NECESSARY FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE COULD ALL WISH HIM DISENGAGED FROM EVERY TIE OF BUSINESS
CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE OPINIONS ALTER BUT MY OPINION OF YOUR BROTHER NEVER DID ALTER IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME YOU ARE DESCRIBING WHAT NEVER HAPPENED MY DEAREST CATHERINE CONTINUED THE OTHER WITHOUT AT ALL LISTENING TO HER
WHY INDEED SAID HE IN HIS NATURAL TONE BUT SOME EMOTION MUST APPEAR TO BE RAISED BY YOUR REPLY AND SURPRISE IS MORE EASILY ASSUMED AND NOT LESS REASONABLE THAN ANY OTHER NOW LET US GO ON
THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED EVEN TO SEE HER WHAT COULD ALL THIS MEAN BUT AN INTENTIONAL AFFRONT BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER SHE MUST HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO OFFEND HIM ELEANOR HAD WISHED TO SPARE HER FROM SO PAINFUL A NOTION
BUT IT WAS A DEGREE OF WILFUL THOUGHTLESSNESS WHICH CATHERINE COULD NOT BUT RESENT JAMES WAS THE SUFFERER SHE SAW HIM GRAVE AND UNEASY AND HOWEVER CARELESS OF HIS PRESENT COMFORT
HE WAS WITH US JUST NOW AND SAID HE WAS SO TIRED OF LOUNGING ABOUT THAT HE WAS RESOLVED TO GO AND DANCE SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS HE WOULD ASK YOU IF HE MET WITH YOU
HE RAN IT A FEW WEEKS TILL I BELIEVE IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT
YES I THINK SO FOR YOU MUST KNOW YOUR BROTHER'S HEART MY BROTHER'S HEART AS YOU TERM IT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION I ASSURE YOU I CAN ONLY GUESS AT WELL
FOR ONE LETTER AT ALL RISKS ALL HAZARDS I MUST ENTREAT
STRIKING AT THAT INSTANT ON HER MIND WITH PECULIAR FORCE
SHE IS JUST THE KIND OF YOUNG WOMAN I COULD WISH TO SEE YOU ATTACHED TO SHE HAS SO MUCH GOOD SENSE AND IS SO THOROUGHLY UNAFFECTED AND AMIABLE I ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO KNOW HER AND SHE SEEMS VERY FOND OF YOU SHE SAID THE HIGHEST THINGS IN YOUR PRAISE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
THOUGH IT HAS TURNED OUT SO WELL FOR US I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL AS IT HAPPENS THERE IS NO GREAT HARM DONE BECAUSE I DO NOT THINK ISABELLA HAS ANY HEART TO LOSE BUT SUPPOSE HE HAD MADE HER VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM
AND ISABELLA HAVING GONE THROUGH THE USUAL CEREMONIAL OF MEETING HER FRIEND WITH THE MOST SMILING AND AFFECTIONATE HASTE OF ADMIRING THE SET OF HER GOWN AND ENVYING THE CURL OF HER HAIR THEY FOLLOWED THEIR CHAPERONES ARM IN ARM INTO THE BALLROOM
OF NORTHANGER ABBEY HAVING BEEN A RICHLY ENDOWED CONVENT AT THE TIME OF THE REFORMATION OF ITS HAVING FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF AN ANCESTOR OF THE TILNEYS ON ITS DISSOLUTION
IF HE KNOWS HER ENGAGEMENT WHAT CAN HE MEAN BY HIS BEHAVIOUR YOU ARE A VERY CLOSE QUESTIONER AM I I ONLY ASK WHAT I WANT TO BE TOLD
WAS REPEATED BY THEM ALL TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER FOR A MOMENT CATHERINE WAS SURPRISED BUT MISSUS THORPE AND HER DAUGHTERS HAD SCARCELY BEGUN THE HISTORY OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER JAMES MORLAND
AND CATHERINE CATCHING MISTER TILNEY'S EYE INSTANTLY RECEIVED FROM HIM THE SMILING TRIBUTE OF RECOGNITION SHE RETURNED IT WITH PLEASURE AND THEN ADVANCING STILL NEARER HE SPOKE BOTH TO HER AND MISSUS ALLEN
AND YET UNEQUAL TO AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD
I DINE WITH MISS TILNEY TODAY AND MUST NOW BE GOING HOME NAY BUT THERE IS NO SUCH CONFOUNDED HURRY WHO KNOWS WHEN WE MAY BE TOGETHER AGAIN NOT BUT THAT I SHALL BE DOWN AGAIN BY THE END OF A FORTNIGHT
PROTESTING HER INNOCENCE OF EVERY THOUGHT OF MISTER THORPE'S BEING IN LOVE WITH HER AND THE CONSEQUENT IMPOSSIBILITY OF HER HAVING EVER INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE HIM
I NEVER WAS SO DECEIVED IN ANYONE'S CHARACTER IN MY LIFE BEFORE AMONG ALL THE GREAT VARIETY THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN AND STUDIED MY OWN DISAPPOINTMENT AND LOSS IN HER IS VERY GREAT BUT AS FOR POOR JAMES
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR FIFTEEN SONNETS IN CELEBRATION OF HER CHARMS AND WENT TO HER CHAIR IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH EVERYBODY
I ASSURE YOU SAID SHE I WOULD NOT STAND UP WITHOUT YOUR DEAR SISTER FOR ALL THE WORLD FOR IF I DID WE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE SEPARATED THE WHOLE EVENING CATHERINE ACCEPTED THIS KINDNESS WITH GRATITUDE
DO YOU FIND BATH AS AGREEABLE AS WHEN I HAD THE HONOUR OF MAKING THE INQUIRY BEFORE YES QUITE MORE SO INDEED MORE SO TAKE CARE OR YOU WILL FORGET TO BE TIRED OF IT AT THE PROPER TIME YOU OUGHT TO BE TIRED AT THE END OF SIX WEEKS
WORSE TO BE TOLD SHE SAID NOTHING AND ELEANOR ENDEAVOURING TO COLLECT HERSELF AND SPEAK WITH FIRMNESS BUT WITH EYES STILL CAST DOWN SOON WENT ON YOU ARE TOO GOOD I AM SURE
IF I CAN BUT BE NEAR YOU I SHALL BE SATISFIED BUT THIS IS IDLE TALKING I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS TILL WE HAVE YOUR FATHER'S ANSWER MORLAND SAYS THAT BY SENDING IT TONIGHT TO SALISBURY WE MAY HAVE IT TOMORROW TOMORROW
AND COULD WE CARRY OUR SELFISH POINT WITH YOU WE SHOULD LEAVE IT WITHOUT A SINGLE REGRET CAN YOU IN SHORT BE PREVAILED ON TO QUIT THIS SCENE OF PUBLIC TRIUMPH AND OBLIGE YOUR FRIEND ELEANOR WITH YOUR COMPANY IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE
IS HE IN THE HOUSE NOW LOOK ABOUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE I ASSURE YOU I CAN HARDLY EXIST TILL I SEE HIM NO SAID CATHERINE HE IS NOT HERE I CANNOT SEE HIM ANYWHERE OH HORRID
THE ODDS WERE FIVE TO FOUR AGAINST ME AND IF I HAD NOT MADE ONE OF THE CLEANEST STROKES THAT PERHAPS EVER WAS MADE IN THIS WORLD I TOOK HIS BALL EXACTLY BUT I COULD NOT MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND IT WITHOUT A TABLE HOWEVER I DID BEAT HIM A VERY FINE FELLOW AS RICH AS A JEW
AND THE HONEST RELISH OF BALLS AND PLAYS AND EVERYDAY SIGHTS IS PAST WITH THEM HERE THEIR CONVERSATION CLOSED THE DEMANDS OF THE DANCE BECOMING NOW TOO IMPORTUNATE FOR A DIVIDED ATTENTION
BUT TO HER UTTER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND THAT TO PROCEED ALONG THE ROOM WAS BY NO MEANS THE WAY TO DISENGAGE THEMSELVES FROM THE CROWD IT SEEMED RATHER TO INCREASE AS THEY WENT ON
AND MAMMA'S APPROBATION WAS EAGERLY GIVEN
I HAVE BEEN SAYING HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF THE SKINNERS WERE HERE THIS WINTER INSTEAD OF LAST OR IF THE PARRYS HAD COME AS THEY TALKED OF ONCE SHE MIGHT HAVE DANCED WITH GEORGE PARRY I AM SO SORRY SHE HAS NOT HAD A PARTNER
HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER
THAT NOBODY COULD IMAGINE HOW CHARMING IT HAD BEEN AND THAT IT HAD BEEN MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN ANYBODY COULD CONCEIVE SUCH WAS THE INFORMATION OF THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES THE SECOND UNFOLDED THUS MUCH IN DETAIL
A SMALL DOOR CLOSED ALSO WITH A LOCK AND KEY SECURED IN ALL PROBABILITY A CAVITY OF IMPORTANCE CATHERINE'S HEART BEAT QUICK BUT HER COURAGE DID NOT FAIL HER WITH A CHEEK FLUSHED BY HOPE AND AN EYE STRAINING WITH CURIOSITY
HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT VERY ODD TO HEAR ME SAY I WAS ENGAGED THE OTHER EVENING WHEN HE SAW ME SITTING DOWN BUT I REALLY HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHOLE DAY TO MISTER THORPE MISS TILNEY COULD ONLY BOW
WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER AS MISTER HENRY TILNEY WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY
MISTER TILNEY DID NOT APPEAR EVERY CREATURE IN BATH EXCEPT HIMSELF WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE ROOM AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE FASHIONABLE HOURS
AND THE PRAISE OF SUCH A GIRL AS MISS THORPE EVEN YOU CATHERINE
IT IS ALL ONE TO ME REPLIED THORPE RATHER ANGRILY AND INSTANTLY TURNING HIS HORSE THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO BATH
BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS APPEARANCE THERE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED HE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO EXPECT A WELCOME AT FULLERTON AND STATING HIS IMPATIENCE TO BE ASSURED OF MISS MORLAND'S HAVING REACHED HER HOME IN SAFETY
AND CAPABLE AS HERETOFORE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT BY ANYTHING HE SAID THERE WERE STILL SOME SUBJECTS INDEED UNDER WHICH SHE BELIEVED THEY MUST ALWAYS TREMBLE THE MENTION OF A CHEST OR A CABINET FOR INSTANCE
OR A CAP OR A CLOAK MUSLIN CAN NEVER BE SAID TO BE WASTED I HAVE HEARD MY SISTER SAY SO FORTY TIMES WHEN SHE HAS BEEN EXTRAVAGANT IN BUYING MORE THAN SHE WANTED OR CARELESS IN CUTTING IT TO PIECES
HOWEVER IT IS NOT WORTH ARGUING ABOUT FOR WHATEVER MIGHT PASS ON HIS SIDE YOU MUST BE CONVINCED BY MY HAVING NO RECOLLECTION OF IT THAT I NEVER THOUGHT NOR EXPECTED NOR WISHED FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND FROM HIM
ISABELLA IS WRONG BUT I AM SURE SHE CANNOT MEAN TO TORMENT FOR SHE IS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER SHE HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM EVER SINCE THEY FIRST MET AND WHILE MY FATHER'S CONSENT WAS UNCERTAIN SHE FRETTED HERSELF ALMOST INTO A FEVER
AND EVERYTHING THAT IS BAD IN THE WORLD I HOPE SO FAR AS CONCERNS MY BROTHER YOU ARE MISINFORMED I HOPE HE HAS NOT HAD ANY MATERIAL SHARE IN BRINGING ON MISTER MORLAND'S DISAPPOINTMENT
HENRY WAS CONVINCED OF HIS FATHER'S BELIEVING IT TO BE AN ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION IT WAS NOT TILL THE LATE EXPLANATION AT NORTHANGER THAT THEY HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF THE FALSE CALCULATIONS WHICH HAD HURRIED HIM ON
MADE HER WAY TO MISSUS ALLEN AND MISSUS THORPE AS FAST AS SHE COULD
AND WHEN SHE EXPATIATED ON THE TALENTS OF HER SONS AND THE BEAUTY OF HER DAUGHTERS WHEN SHE RELATED THEIR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND VIEWS THAT JOHN WAS AT OXFORD
TILNEY SAYS IT IS ALWAYS THE CASE WITH MINDS OF A CERTAIN STAMP BUT I THOUGHT ISABELLA YOU HAD SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR TO TELL ME OH YES AND SO I HAVE BUT HERE IS A PROOF OF WHAT I WAS SAYING
CATHERINE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHY WAS MISS TILNEY EMBARRASSED COULD THERE BE ANY UNWILLINGNESS ON THE GENERAL'S SIDE TO SHOW HER OVER THE ABBEY THE PROPOSAL WAS HIS OWN
FOR TEN TO ONE WHETHER YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN YOU SHOULD NEVER FRET ABOUT TRIFLES AFTER A SHORT SILENCE I HOPE MY CATHERINE YOU ARE NOT GETTING OUT OF HUMOUR WITH HOME BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO GRAND AS NORTHANGER
IT WAS ONLY IN HIS PRESENCE THAT CATHERINE FELT THE SMALLEST FATIGUE FROM HER JOURNEY AND EVEN THEN EVEN IN MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR RESTRAINT A SENSE OF GENERAL HAPPINESS PREPONDERATED AND SHE COULD THINK OF HER FRIENDS IN BATH WITHOUT ONE WISH OF BEING WITH THEM THE NIGHT WAS STORMY
ME SUCH A SIMPLETON AS TO BE ALWAYS WANTING TO CONFINE HIM TO MY ELBOW IT WOULD BE HIDEOUS TO BE ALWAYS TOGETHER WE SHOULD BE THE JEST OF THE PLACE AND SO YOU ARE GOING TO NORTHANGER I AM AMAZINGLY GLAD OF IT
IT WILL BE SO DIRTY OH THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY I NEVER MIND DIRT NO REPLIED HER FRIEND VERY PLACIDLY I KNOW YOU NEVER MIND DIRT AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
SOON AFTER SIX ELEANOR ENTERED HER ROOM EAGER TO SHOW ATTENTION OR GIVE ASSISTANCE WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE BUT VERY LITTLE REMAINED TO BE DONE
AND CATHERINE FELT HERSELF IN HIGH LUCK THERE WAS LITTLE LEISURE FOR SPEAKING WHILE THEY DANCED BUT WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TEA SHE FOUND HIM AS AGREEABLE AS SHE HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIM CREDIT FOR BEING
THE ANXIETIES OF COMMON LIFE BEGAN SOON TO SUCCEED TO THE ALARMS OF ROMANCE HER DESIRE OF HEARING FROM ISABELLA GREW EVERY DAY GREATER SHE WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO KNOW HOW THE BATH WORLD WENT ON AND HOW THE ROOMS WERE ATTENDED
ENCOURAGED HIS HORSE MADE ODD NOISES AND DROVE ON AND CATHERINE ANGRY AND VEXED AS SHE WAS HAVING NO POWER OF GETTING AWAY WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE POINT AND SUBMIT HER REPROACHES HOWEVER WERE NOT SPARED
HE APPROACHED IMMEDIATELY AND TOOK THE SEAT TO WHICH HER MOVEMENTS INVITED HIM HIS FIRST ADDRESS MADE CATHERINE START THOUGH SPOKEN LOW SHE COULD DISTINGUISH WHAT
WOULD IT BE TO PROMOTE HIS HAPPINESS TO ENABLE HIM TO MARRY SUCH A GIRL SHE MUST BE AN UNPRINCIPLED ONE OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE USED YOUR BROTHER SO AND HOW STRANGE AN INFATUATION ON FREDERICK'S SIDE A GIRL
SOMEBODY GAVE ME A PUSH THAT HAS HURT IT I AM AFRAID NO INDEED IT LOOKS VERY NICE BUT
MAY WE GO UP EVERY STAIRCASE AND INTO EVERY SUITE OF ROOMS YES YES EVERY HOLE AND CORNER BUT THEN IF THEY SHOULD ONLY BE GONE OUT FOR AN HOUR TILL IT IS DRYER AND CALL BY AND BY
THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
THOUGH SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED IN SPEAKING OF IT HAD OCCURRED TO HER THAT AFTER SO LONG AN ABSENCE FROM HOME CATHERINE MIGHT NOT BE PROVIDED WITH MONEY ENOUGH FOR THE EXPENSES OF HER JOURNEY AND UPON SUGGESTING IT TO HER WITH MOST AFFECTIONATE OFFERS OF ACCOMMODATION
MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE HE WAS SURE MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE AND IN THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS
A FEW DAYS PASSED AWAY AND CATHERINE THOUGH NOT ALLOWING HERSELF TO SUSPECT HER FRIEND COULD NOT HELP WATCHING HER CLOSELY THE RESULT OF HER OBSERVATIONS WAS NOT AGREEABLE
I BOUGHT ONE FOR HER THE OTHER DAY AND IT WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE A PRODIGIOUS BARGAIN BY EVERY LADY WHO SAW IT I GAVE BUT FIVE SHILLINGS A YARD FOR IT AND A TRUE INDIAN MUSLIN
HAD NOT THE EASY GAIETY OF MISS THORPE'S MANNERS AND HER FREQUENT EXPRESSIONS OF DELIGHT ON THIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER SOFTENED DOWN EVERY FEELING OF AWE AND LEFT NOTHING BUT TENDER AFFECTION
HAD BEEN THE ONLY CAUSE OF GIVING HER A SERIOUS THOUGHT IT IS A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE IN ROMANCE I ACKNOWLEDGE AND DREADFULLY DEROGATORY OF AN HEROINE'S DIGNITY BUT IF IT BE AS NEW IN COMMON LIFE
WITH A MIND THUS FULL OF HAPPINESS CATHERINE WAS HARDLY AWARE THAT TWO OR THREE DAYS HAD PASSED AWAY WITHOUT HER SEEING ISABELLA FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES TOGETHER SHE BEGAN FIRST TO BE SENSIBLE OF THIS AND TO SIGH FOR HER CONVERSATION
WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF BREATH FROM HASTE WHEN THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST OCCASION FOR HURRY IN THE WORLD
IN WHICH THE WORTHLESSNESS OF LORDS AND ATTORNEYS MIGHT BE SET FORTH
AND SHORT EXCLAMATIONS OF SORROWING WONDER DECLARED HER TO BE RECEIVING UNPLEASANT NEWS AND HENRY EARNESTLY WATCHING HER THROUGH THE WHOLE LETTER SAW PLAINLY THAT IT ENDED NO BETTER THAN IT BEGAN HE WAS PREVENTED HOWEVER
AT THE TIME THAT EUSTACIA WAS LISTENING TO THE RICK MAKERS CONVERSATION ON CLYM'S RETURN THOMASIN WAS CLIMBING INTO A LOFT OVER HER AUNT'S FUELHOUSE WHERE THE STORE APPLES WERE KEPT
AS A BLACK SPOT IN THE AIR ABOVE THE CROWN OF THE HILL ON REACHING THIS PLACE MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FELT DISTRESSINGLY AGITATED WEARY AND UNWELL SHE ASCENDED
AND THE WHOLE ENCLOSURE OF THE LITTLE DOMICILE AND NOW AT THE MOMENT OF RISING SHE SAW A SECOND MAN APPROACHING THE GATE HIS MANNER WAS PECULIAR HESITATING
AND EVEN STIFF CABBAGES WERE LIMP BY NOON IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ON THIS DAY THAT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT STARTED ACROSS THE HEATH TOWARDS HER SON'S HOUSE TO DO HER BEST IN GETTING RECONCILED WITH HIM AND EUSTACIA
SHE STOPPED A MOMENT DEAR CLYM I WONDER HOW YOUR FACE LOOKS NOW SHE SAID GAZING ABSTRACTEDLY AT THE PIGEON HOLE
SHE SOMETIMES SAT DOWN UNDER HER UMBRELLA TO REST AND TO WATCH THEIR HAPPINESS FOR A CERTAIN HOPEFULNESS AS TO THE RESULT OF HER VISIT GAVE EASE TO HER MIND AND BETWEEN IMPORTANT THOUGHTS LEFT IT FREE TO DWELL
AUNT SHE SAID PRESENTLY I HAVE I THINK A RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION YES YOU HAVE
AND SHE DETERMINED THAT HER WALK SHOULD BE IN THE DIRECTION OF BLOOMS END THE BIRTHPLACE OF YOUNG YEOBRIGHT AND THE PRESENT HOME OF HIS MOTHER SHE HAD NO REASON FOR WALKING ELSEWHERE AND
WOULD YOUR GRANDFATHER ALLOW YOU I THINK HE WOULD ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT SHOULD NOT LAST LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS I WILL GUARANTEE THAT IF NO MISFORTUNE HAPPENS IF NO MISFORTUNE HAPPENS
ON ANY INFINITESIMAL MATTER WHICH CAUGHT HER EYES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN TO HER SON'S HOUSE AND ITS EXACT POSITION WAS UNKNOWN TO HER
WHICH MARKED THE VERGE OF THE HEATH IN THIS LATITUDE THEY SHOWED UPON THE DUSKY SCENE THAT THEY BORDERED AS DISTINCTLY AS WHITE LACE ON VELVET BEHIND THE WHITE PALINGS WAS A LITTLE GARDEN BEHIND THE GARDEN
A CERTAIN GLAD AND VOLUPTUOUS AIR OF TRIUMPH PERVADING HER EYES AT HAVING WON BY HER OWN UNAIDED SELF A MAN WHO WAS HER PERFECT COMPLEMENT IN ATTAINMENT APPEARANCE AND AGE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S PART
IT WAS A FINE AND QUIET AFTERNOON ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK BUT THE WINTER SOLSTICE HAVING STEALTHILY COME ON THE LOWNESS OF THE SUN CAUSED THE HOUR TO SEEM LATER THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS
YOU GIVE UP YOUR WHOLE THOUGHT YOU SET YOUR WHOLE SOUL TO PLEASE A WOMAN I DO AND THAT WOMAN IS YOU HOW CAN YOU TREAT ME SO FLIPPANTLY SAID HIS MOTHER TURNING AGAIN TO HIM WITH A TEARFUL LOOK
EVEN STRONGER AND MORE ACTIVE THAN HER OWN THE TREES BENEATH WHICH SHE SAT WERE SINGULARLY BATTERED RUDE AND WILD AND FOR A FEW MINUTES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT DISMISSED THOUGHTS OF HER OWN STORM BROKEN
THE FURZE CUTTER WAS SO ABSORBED IN THE BUSINESS OF HIS JOURNEY THAT HE NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD AND HIS LEATHER LEGGED AND GAUNTLETED FORM AT LENGTH BECAME TO HER AS NOTHING MORE THAN A MOVING HANDPOST TO SHOW HER THE WAY
BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF IT HE MUST SOON KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED A MERE LOOK AT YOUR FACE WILL SHOW HIM THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG THOMASIN TURNED AND REGARDED HER AUNT FROM THE TREE
MADE HIM KNOWN TO THE WATCHMAN OF THE KING HIS WALK IS EXACTLY AS MY HUSBAND'S USED TO BE SHE SAID AND THEN THE THOUGHT BURST UPON HER THAT THE FURZE CUTTER WAS HER SON
THE AIR WAS WARM WITH A VAPOROUS WARMTH AND THE STILLNESS WAS UNBROKEN
THAT'S A BAD TROUBLE ABOUT HIS COUSIN THOMASIN
TO ANY OTHER PERSON THAN A MOTHER IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED A LITTLE HUMILIATING THAT SHE THE ELDER OF THE TWO WOMEN SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO MAKE ADVANCES BUT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD WELL CONSIDERED ALL THAT AND SHE ONLY THOUGHT
EUSTACIA WAS INDOORS IN THE DINING ROOM WHICH WAS REALLY MORE LIKE A KITCHEN HAVING A STONE FLOOR AND A GAPING CHIMNEY CORNER THE AIR WAS STILL AND WHILE SHE LINGERED A MOMENT HERE ALONE
THE LUMINOUS RAYS WRAPPED HER UP WITH HER INCREASING DISTANCE AND THE RUSTLE OF HER DRESS OVER THE SPROUTING SEDGE AND GRASS DIED AWAY AS HE WATCHED THE DEAD FLAT OF THE SCENERY OVERPOWERED HIM
SHE TRIED ONE ASCENDING PATH AND ANOTHER AND FOUND THAT THEY LED HER ASTRAY RETRACING HER STEPS SHE CAME AGAIN TO AN OPEN LEVEL WHERE SHE PERCEIVED AT A DISTANCE A MAN AT WORK
STRETCHED OUT IN FLATS BENEATH A SKY OF PALE SOFT GREEN ALL DARK OBJECTS ON THE EARTH THAT LAY TOWARDS THE SUN WERE OVERSPREAD BY A PURPLE HAZE AGAINST WHICH GROUPS OF WAILING GNATS SHONE OUT
EVEN THE PURPLE HEATH FLOWERS HAVING PUT ON A BROWNNESS UNDER THE DRY BLAZES OF THE FEW PRECEDING DAYS EVERY VALLEY WAS FILLED WITH AIR LIKE THAT OF A KILN
TO SEARCH OUT THE BEST AND LARGEST OF THEM FOR THE COMING HOLIDAY TIME THE LOFT WAS LIGHTED BY A SEMICIRCULAR HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE PIGEONS CREPT TO THEIR LODGINGS IN THE SAME HIGH QUARTERS OF THE PREMISES
THAT IS THOSE WHO HAVE HAD NO PRELIMINARY TRAINING MY PLAN IS ONE FOR INSTILLING HIGH KNOWLEDGE INTO EMPTY MINDS WITHOUT FIRST CRAMMING THEM WITH WHAT HAS TO BE UNCRAMMED AGAIN BEFORE TRUE STUDY BEGINS
RISING UPWARDS AND DANCING ABOUT LIKE SPARKS OF FIRE O
I THINK HE MAY DO IT NOW THAT HE KNOWS SOMETHING I TOLD HIM I DON'T FOR A MOMENT DISPUTE THAT IT IS THE MOST PROPER THING FOR YOU TO MARRY HIM MUCH AS I HAVE OBJECTED TO HIM IN BYGONE DAYS I AGREE WITH YOU NOW YOU MAY BE SURE
THE WORDS OF SAM AND HUMPHREY ON THE HARMONY BETWEEN THE UNKNOWN AND HERSELF HAD ON HER MIND THE EFFECT OF THE INVADING BARD'S PRELUDE IN THE CASTLE OF INDOLENCE
ANY MORE THAN I AM AN IMPROPER WOMAN HE HAS AN UNFORTUNATE MANNER AND DOESN'T TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE HIM IF THEY DON'T WISH TO DO IT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THOMASIN
WHICH ADMITTED THE SUNLIGHT SO DIRECTLY UPON HER BROWN HAIR AND TRANSPARENT TISSUES THAT IT ALMOST SEEMED TO SHINE THROUGH HER IF HE COULD HAVE BEEN DEAR TO YOU IN ANOTHER WAY SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FROM THE LADDER
ENTER HIS OWN DOOR AT ONE SIDE OF CLYM'S HOUSE WAS A KNOLL AND ON THE TOP OF THE KNOLL A CLUMP OF FIR TREES SO HIGHLY THRUST UP INTO THE SKY THAT THEIR FOLIAGE FROM A DISTANCE APPEARED
SAID THE CAPTAIN SHORTLY AFTER WHICH HE WALKED AWAY I SAY SAM OBSERVED HUMPHREY WHEN THE OLD MAN WAS GONE
WHERE IS MISSUS YEOBRIGHT SHE HAS NOT COME HE REPLIED IN A SUBDUED TONE I WISH I HAD KNOWN THAT YOU WOULD BE HERE ALONE SHE SAID SERIOUSLY AND THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SUCH AN IDLE PLEASANT TIME AS THIS
YOU ANSWER ME YOU THINK ONLY OF HER YOU STICK TO HER IN ALL THINGS THAT PROVES HER TO BE WORTHY I HAVE NEVER YET SUPPORTED WHAT IS BAD AND I DO NOT CARE ONLY FOR HER I CARE FOR YOU
STRANGE THAT SUCH A PIECE OF IDLING SHOULD HAVE SEEMED AN IMPORTANT ERRAND SHE PUT ON HER BONNET AND LEAVING THE HOUSE DESCENDED THE HILL ON THE SIDE TOWARDS BLOOMS END
I MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED YOU IF YOU HAD KEPT YOURSELF FREE FROM ENTANGLEMENTS BUT THIS WOMAN IF SHE HAD BEEN A GOOD GIRL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BAD ENOUGH BUT BEING SHE IS A GOOD GIRL SO YOU THINK A CORFU BANDMASTER'S DAUGHTER
A BEING TO FIGHT FOR SUPPORT HELP BE MALIGNED FOR
WHEN A WOMAN ONCE DISLIKES ANOTHER SHE IS MERCILESS O CLYM PLEASE DON'T GO SETTING DOWN AS MY FAULT WHAT IS YOUR OBSTINATE WRONGHEADEDNESS IF YOU WISHED TO CONNECT YOURSELF WITH AN UNWORTHY PERSON WHY DID YOU COME HOME HERE TO DO IT
HOW BEST TO MAKE HER VISIT APPEAR TO EUSTACIA NOT ABJECT BUT WISE FROM HER ELEVATED POSITION THE EXHAUSTED WOMAN COULD PERCEIVE THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE BELOW AND THE GARDEN
BUT DARLING WHAT SHALL WE DO SAID HE STILL GO ON AS WE DO NOW JUST LIVE ON FROM MEETING TO MEETING NEVER MINDING ABOUT ANOTHER DAY YOU I KNOW ARE ALWAYS THINKING OF THAT I CAN SEE YOU ARE
AMID WHICH THE MAGGOTY SHAPES OF INNUMERABLE OBSCURE CREATURES COULD BE INDISTINCTLY SEEN HEAVING AND WALLOWING WITH ENJOYMENT BEING A WOMAN NOT DISINCLINED TO PHILOSOPHIZE
WHENEVER IT PREVAILED SOME WERE BLASTED AND SPLIT AS IF BY LIGHTNING BLACK STAINS AS FROM FIRE MARKING THEIR SIDES WHILE THE GROUND AT THEIR FEET WAS STREWN WITH DEAD FIR NEEDLES AND HEAPS OF CONES
HE WAS IN A NEST OF VIVID GREEN THE FERNY VEGETATION ROUND HIM THOUGH SO ABUNDANT WAS QUITE UNIFORM IT WAS A GROVE OF MACHINE MADE FOLIAGE A WORLD OF GREEN TRIANGLES WITH SAW EDGES AND NOT A SINGLE FLOWER
A YOUNG AND CLEVER MAN WAS COMING INTO THAT LONELY HEATH FROM OF ALL CONTRASTING PLACES IN THE WORLD PARIS
SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM AND INQUIRED THE WAY THE LABOURER POINTED OUT THE DIRECTION AND ADDED
THEY STOOD STILL AND PREPARED TO BID EACH OTHER FAREWELL EVERYTHING BEFORE THEM WAS ON A PERFECT LEVEL THE SUN RESTING ON THE HORIZON LINE STREAMED ACROSS THE GROUND FROM BETWEEN COPPER COLOURED AND LILAC CLOUDS
IT WAS NOW NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE SUNLIGHT WAS LEAVING THE VALES WHEN THE WEST GREW RED THE TWO RELATIVES CAME AGAIN FROM THE HOUSE AND PLUNGED INTO THE HEATH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM THE FIRST
A WOMAN CAN HARDLY PASS FOR SHAME SOMETIMES
LIT BY A FEW STRAY MOTES OF LIGHT AS SHE STOOD HALFWAY UP THE LADDER LOOKING AT A SPOT INTO WHICH SHE WAS NOT CLIMBER ENOUGH TO VENTURE NOW A FEW RUSSETS TAMSIN
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THESE NEW MOVES IN FAMILIES MY FATHER WAS A SAILOR SO WAS I AND SO SHOULD MY SON HAVE BEEN IF I HAD HAD ONE THE PLACE HE'S BEEN LIVING AT IS PARIS SAID HUMPHREY
THEN SHE REPLIED BEST IS IT BEST FOR YOU TO INJURE YOUR PROSPECTS FOR SUCH A VOLUPTUOUS IDLE WOMAN AS THAT DON'T YOU SEE THAT BY THE VERY FACT OF YOUR CHOOSING HER YOU PROVE THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU
KEEP A SCHOOL IN BUDMOUTH AS I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT'S INCREDIBLE THE PLACE IS OVERRUN WITH SCHOOLMASTERS YOU HAVE NO SPECIAL QUALIFICATIONS WHAT POSSIBLE CHANCE IS THERE FOR SUCH AS YOU
WHERE HE PAUSED AWHILE ON COMING IN HER TURN TO EACH OF THESE SPOTS SHE FOUND HALF A DOZEN LONG LIMP BRAMBLES WHICH HE HAD CUT FROM THE BUSH DURING HIS HALT AND LAID OUT STRAIGHT BESIDE THE PATH
THOMASIN CAME DOWN WHEN THE APPLES WERE COLLECTED AND TOGETHER THEY WENT THROUGH THE WHITE PALINGS TO THE HEATH BEYOND THE OPEN HILLS WERE AIRY AND CLEAR AND THE REMOTE ATMOSPHERE APPEARED
LET HIM BUT SINCE HE LOVED ME ONCE WE WILL NOT PAIN HIM BY TELLING HIM MY TROUBLE TOO SOON THE AIR IS FULL OF THE STORY I KNOW BUT GOSSIPS WILL NOT DARE TO SPEAK OF IT TO HIM FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS HIS CLOSENESS TO ME
WHATEVER YOU DO YOU WILL ALWAYS BE DEAR TO ME THAT YOU KNOW BUT ONE THING I HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY WHICH IS THAT AT MY AGE I AM OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR ME MISSUS YEOBRIGHT REMAINED FOR SOME TIME SILENT AND SHAKEN AS IF SHE COULD SAY NO MORE
YOU HAVE TIS NEWS TO ME WHILE THE FURZE GATHERERS HAD DESULTORILY CONVERSED THUS EUSTACIA'S FACE GRADUALLY BENT TO THE HEARTH
AND SAT DOWN UNDER THEIR SHADE TO RECOVER HERSELF AND TO CONSIDER HOW BEST TO BREAK THE GROUND WITH EUSTACIA SO AS NOT TO IRRITATE A WOMAN UNDERNEATH WHOSE APPARENT INDOLENCE LURKED PASSIONS
AND THAT I DID NOT EXPECT HIM HOME SO SOON AND YOU MUST NOT LET ME STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR CHRISTMAS PARTY PUTTING IT OFF WOULD ONLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE OF COURSE I SHALL NOT I DO NOT WISH TO SHOW MYSELF BEATEN BEFORE ALL EGDON
HOW DO YOU MEAN I HAVE LONG HAD A SUSPICION THAT YOUR LOVE FOR HIM HAS CHANGED ITS COLOUR
UPON COMING SUDDENLY INTO HAPPINESS HAVE DIED FROM ANXIETY LEST THEY SHOULD NOT LIVE TO ENJOY IT I FELT MYSELF IN THAT WHIMSICAL STATE OF UNEASINESS LATELY BUT I SHALL BE SPARED IT NOW LET US WALK ON
SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT QUIETLY FIXING HER EYE UPON HER NIECE
IN CONFORMITY WITH HER WORDS TO THE REDDLEMAN SHE HAD HOPED TO BE WELL ADVANCED IN HER WALK BEFORE THE HEAT OF THE DAY WAS AT ITS HIGHEST BUT AFTER SETTING OUT SHE FOUND THAT THIS WAS NOT TO BE DONE
ALL THAT AFTERNOON THE EXPECTED ARRIVAL OF THE SUBJECT OF EUSTACIA'S RUMINATIONS CREATED A BUSTLE OF PREPARATION AT BLOOMS END THOMASIN HAD BEEN PERSUADED BY HER AUNT
TILL THEY WERE DIMINISHED TO AN ISOLATED ONE HERE AND THERE BY THE INCREASING FERTILITY OF THE SOIL
AND SET THE SURROUNDING RABBITS CURIOUSLY WATCHING FROM HILLOCKS AT A SAFE DISTANCE THE PERFORMANCE WAS THAT OF BRINGING TOGETHER AND BUILDING INTO A STACK THE FURZE FAGGOTS
SOME IN THE AIR SOME ON THE HOT GROUND AND VEGETATION SOME IN THE TEPID AND STRINGY WATER OF A NEARLY DRIED POOL ALL THE SHALLOWER PONDS HAD DECREASED TO A VAPOROUS MUD
SAID HER AUNT WHO STOOD AT THE EDGE OF THE PIT
YOU HAVE COME ONLY TO DISTRESS ME A LONELY WOMAN AND SHORTEN MY DAYS I WISH THAT YOU WOULD BESTOW YOUR PRESENCE WHERE YOU BESTOW YOUR LOVE CLYM SAID HUSKILY YOU ARE MY MOTHER I WILL SAY NO MORE BEYOND THIS
SHE CAME DOWN THE HILL TO THE GATE AND LOOKED INTO THE HOT GARDEN THERE LAY THE CAT ASLEEP ON THE BARE GRAVEL OF THE PATH AS IF BEDS RUGS AND CARPETS WERE UNENDURABLE
IN A PROFOUND REVERIE HER TOE UNCONSCIOUSLY TAPPING THE DRY TURF WHICH LAY BURNING AT HER FEET
THE LEAVES OF THE HOLLYHOCKS HUNG LIKE HALF CLOSED UMBRELLAS THE SAP ALMOST SIMMERED IN THE STEMS AND FOLIAGE WITH A SMOOTH SURFACE GLARED LIKE METALLIC MIRRORS
AND HELP CARRY ANYTHING FOR'N THOUGH I SUPPOSE HE'S ALTERED FROM THE BOY HE WAS THEY SAY HE CAN TALK FRENCH AS FAST AS A MAID CAN EAT BLACKBERRIES AND IF SO DEPEND UPON IT WE WHO HAVE STAYED AT HOME
AND FROM THIS HOLE THE SUN SHONE IN A BRIGHT YELLOW PATCH UPON THE FIGURE OF THE MAIDEN AS SHE KNELT AND PLUNGED HER NAKED ARMS INTO THE SOFT BROWN FERN WHICH FROM ITS ABUNDANCE
FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN IN A SPOT WHERE A PATH EMERGED FROM ONE OF THE SMALL HOLLOWS AND WAITED HITHER IT WAS THAT HE HAD PROMISED EUSTACIA TO BRING HIS MOTHER THIS AFTERNOON THAT THEY MIGHT MEET AND BE FRIENDS HIS ATTEMPT HAD UTTERLY FAILED
THE PRISON OF MARY STUART OR THE CHATEAU OF HOUGOMONT AFTER PASSING ROUND AND AGAIN REACHING THE GATE HE WENT IN
THEY REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE HOLLIES GREW WHICH WAS IN A CONICAL PIT SO THAT THE TOPS OF THE TREES WERE NOT MUCH ABOVE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF THE GROUND THOMASIN STEPPED UP INTO A FORK OF ONE OF THE BUSHES
NOW I PUT IT TO YOU WOULD YOU AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT AGREE TO BE HIS WIFE IF THAT HAD NOT HAPPENED TO ENTANGLE YOU WITH HIM THOMASIN LOOKED INTO THE TREE AND APPEARED MUCH DISTURBED
ONE TIDINGS OF THE COMER
IS THE VERY THING THAT WILL HINDER THE TALE FROM REACHING HIM EARLY IF I AM NOT MADE SAFE FROM SNEERS IN A WEEK OR TWO I WILL TELL HIM MYSELF THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH THOMASIN SPOKE PREVENTED FURTHER OBJECTIONS
IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY SYSTEM LEFT TO BE INVENTED THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT OUT AT THE UNIVERSITIES LONG BEFORE THIS TIME NEVER MOTHER THEY CANNOT FIND IT OUT BECAUSE THEIR TEACHERS DON'T COME IN CONTACT WITH THE CLASS WHICH DEMANDS SUCH A SYSTEM
WAS USED ON EGDON IN PACKING AWAY STORES OF ALL KINDS THE PIGEONS WERE FLYING ABOUT HER HEAD WITH THE GREATEST UNCONCERN AND THE FACE OF HER AUNT WAS JUST VISIBLE ABOVE THE FLOOR OF THE LOFT
SO THAT OTHER GIRLS MAY TAKE WARNING AND KEEP CLEAR OF IT THOMASIN LOWERED HER FACE TO THE APPLES AGAIN I AM A WARNING TO OTHERS JUST AS THIEVES AND DRUNKARDS AND GAMBLERS ARE
ON THE PRESENT HEATED AFTERNOON WHEN NO PERCEPTIBLE WIND WAS BLOWING THE TREES KEPT UP A PERPETUAL MOAN WHICH ONE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE TO BE CAUSED BY THE AIR
WILL YOU WALK WITH ME TO MEET HIM THIS EVENING I SHOULD LIKE TO ELSE IT WOULD SEEM AS IF I HAD FORGOTTEN HIM SAID THOMASIN TOSSING OUT A BOUGH NOT THAT THAT WOULD MATTER MUCH
AND THEY TELL ME TIS WHERE THE KING'S HEAD WAS CUT OFF YEARS AGO MY POOR MOTHER USED TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT BUSINESS HUMMY SHE USED TO SAY I WAS A YOUNG MAID THEN
HERE SHE SAT FOR TWENTY MINUTES OR MORE ERE SHE COULD SUMMON RESOLUTION TO GO DOWN TO THE DOOR HER COURAGE BEING LOWERED TO ZERO BY HER PHYSICAL LASSITUDE
IN THAT DAMNED SURGERY OF THE TRIUMPH SEEING MEN BROUGHT DOWN TO THE COCKPIT WITH THEIR LEGS AND ARMS BLOWN TO JERICHO AND SO THE YOUNG MAN HAS SETTLED IN PARIS MANAGER TO A DIAMOND MERCHANT OR SOME SUCH THING IS HE NOT
OF A MILE AND A HALF THIS BROUGHT HER TO A SPOT IN WHICH THE GREEN BOTTOM OF THE DALE BEGAN TO WIDEN
THE EARTH AND EVERY DROP OF WATER THAT WAS TO BE FOUND IN MISSUS YEOBRIGHT'S GARDEN LARGE LEAVED PLANTS OF A TENDER KIND FLAGGED BY TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING RHUBARB BENT DOWNWARD AT ELEVEN
FIVE SHARP WORDS ARE SPOKEN AND A CRISIS ENSUES WHEN YEOBRIGHT WAS NOT WITH EUSTACIA HE WAS SITTING SLAVISHLY OVER HIS BOOKS WHEN HE WAS NOT READING HE WAS MEETING HER
I HAVE FEARED MY BLISS SHE SAID WITH THE MEREST MOTION OF HER LIPS IT HAS BEEN TOO INTENSE AND CONSUMING THERE IS HOPE YET THERE ARE FORTY YEARS OF WORK IN ME YET AND WHY SHOULD YOU DESPAIR
THOMASIN CAME OUT OF THE TREE SHOOK FROM HER HAIR AND DRESS THE LOOSE BERRIES WHICH HAD FALLEN THEREON AND WENT DOWN THE HILL WITH HER AUNT EACH WOMAN BEARING HALF THE GATHERED BOUGHS
NOW HEARKEN TO ME SHE SAID HER DELICATE VOICE EXPANDING INTO FIRMNESS BY A FORCE WHICH WAS OTHER THAN PHYSICAL TELL HIM NOTHING
AND THE MOIST HOLLOWS OF THE HEATH HAD PASSED FROM THEIR BROWN TO THEIR GREEN STAGE YEOBRIGHT WALKED TO THE EDGE OF THE BASIN WHICH EXTENDED DOWN FROM MISTOVER AND RAINBARROW BY THIS TIME HE WAS CALM AND HE LOOKED OVER THE LANDSCAPE
HAD THE NOVELTY OF PAGEANTRY AND WHERE ANY MAN COULD IMAGINE HIMSELF TO BE ADAM WITHOUT THE LEAST DIFFICULTY THEY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF EVERY BIRD WITHIN EYESHOT EVERY REPTILE NOT YET ASLEEP
ONLY AT ODD TIMES BY WAY OF USEFUL PASTIME YET SHE NOW BEHELD HIM AS A FURZE CUTTER AND NOTHING MORE WEARING THE REGULATION DRESS OF THE CRAFT
CLYM TOOK THE HAND WHICH WAS ALREADY BARED FOR HIM IT WAS A FAVOURITE WAY WITH THEM TO WALK BARE HAND IN BARE HAND AND LED HER THROUGH THE FERNS THEY FORMED A VERY COMELY PICTURE OF LOVE AT FULL FLUSH AS THEY WALKED ALONG THE VALLEY THAT LATE AFTERNOON
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL OF IT THERE WAS SOMETHING QUEER BETWEEN HER AND THOMASIN'S HUSBAND AT ONE TIME I AM AS SURE OF IT AS THAT I STAND HERE EUSTACIA HAS TOLD ME HE DID PAY HER A LITTLE ATTENTION A YEAR AGO BUT THERE'S NO HARM IN THAT
AS TO GET HOME AGAIN SO SHE WENT ON THE AIR AROUND HER PULSATING SILENTLY AND OPPRESSING THE EARTH WITH LASSITUDE SHE LOOKED AT THE SKY OVERHEAD
I AM ONLY AT AN AWKWARD TURNING I WISH PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE SO READY TO THINK THAT THERE IS NO PROGRESS WITHOUT UNIFORMITY AH YOUR MIND RUNS OFF TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL SIDE OF IT WELL
HIS PROGRESS WHEN ACTUALLY WALKING WAS MORE RAPID THAN MISSUS YEOBRIGHT'S BUT SHE WAS ENABLED TO KEEP AT AN EQUABLE DISTANCE FROM HIM BY HIS HABIT OF STOPPING WHENEVER HE CAME TO A BRAKE OF BRAMBLES
HER AUNT SIMPLY SAID VERY WELL HE SHOULD BY RIGHTS HAVE BEEN TOLD AT THE TIME THAT THE WEDDING WAS GOING TO BE HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR YOUR SECRECY YES HE WILL WHEN HE KNOWS IT WAS BECAUSE I WISHED TO SPARE HIM
AND EXHAUSTED STATE TO CONTEMPLATE THEIRS NOT A BOUGH IN THE NINE TREES WHICH COMPOSED THE GROUP BUT WAS SPLINTERED LOPPED AND DISTORTED BY THE FIERCE WEATHER THAT THERE HELD THEM AT ITS MERCY
POOR CLYM SHE CONTINUED LOOKING TENDERLY INTO HIS FACE YOU ARE SAD SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED AT YOUR HOME NEVER MIND WHAT IS LET US ONLY LOOK AT WHAT SEEMS
WHEN SHE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF EXTERNALS IT WAS DUSK THE FURZE RICK WAS FINISHED THE MEN HAD GONE HOME EUSTACIA WENT UPSTAIRS THINKING THAT SHE WOULD TAKE A WALK AT THIS HER USUAL TIME
BUT A MOMENT'S THOUGHT SHOWED HER THAT THE PRESENCE OF AN ACQUAINTANCE WOULD TAKE OFF THE AWKWARDNESS OF HER FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE HOUSE BY CONFINING THE TALK TO GENERAL MATTERS UNTIL SHE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THEM
BUT YOU MUST NOT WILL YOU DEAR CLYM YOU ARE JUST LIKE ALL WOMEN THEY ARE EVER CONTENT TO BUILD THEIR LIVES ON ANY INCIDENTAL POSITION THAT OFFERS ITSELF WHILST MEN WOULD FAIN MAKE A GLOBE TO SUIT THEM
NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER THAN TO SEE THEM TWO MAN AND WIFE THEY'D LOOK VERY NATTY ARM IN CROOK TOGETHER AND THEIR BEST CLOTHES ON WHETHER OR NO
YOU ARE UNNATURAL CLYM AND I DID NOT EXPECT IT VERY LIKELY SAID HE CHEERLESSLY YOU DID NOT KNOW THE MEASURE YOU WERE GOING TO METE ME AND THEREFORE DID NOT KNOW THE MEASURE THAT WOULD BE RETURNED TO YOU AGAIN
THE JOURNEY ACROSS THE HEATH THURSDAY THE THIRTY FIRST OF AUGUST WAS ONE OF A SERIES OF DAYS DURING WHICH SNUG HOUSES WERE STIFLING AND WHEN COOL DRAUGHTS WERE TREATS
BUT THE PRESENT TORRID ATTACK MADE THE JOURNEY A HEAVY UNDERTAKING FOR A WOMAN PAST MIDDLE AGE AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD MILE SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD HIRED FAIRWAY TO DRIVE HER A PORTION AT LEAST OF THE DISTANCE
HE'S GOING TO THE SAME PLACE MA'AM SHE FOLLOWED THE FIGURE INDICATED HE APPEARED OF A RUSSET HUE NOT MORE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SCENE AROUND HIM THAN THE GREEN CATERPILLAR FROM THE LEAF IT FEEDS ON
THESE MEETINGS WERE CARRIED ON WITH THE GREATEST SECRECY ONE AFTERNOON HIS MOTHER CAME HOME FROM A MORNING VISIT TO THOMASIN
SHALL SEEM NO MORE THAN SCROFF IN HIS EYES
PLEASURE NOT KNOWN BEFOREHAND IS HALF WASTED TO ANTICIPATE IT IS TO DOUBLE IT I HAVE NOT THOUGHT ONCE TODAY OF HAVING YOU ALL TO MYSELF THIS AFTERNOON AND THE ACTUAL MOMENT OF A THING IS SO SOON GONE IT IS INDEED
WERE WASPS ROLLING DRUNK WITH THE JUICE OR CREEPING ABOUT THE LITTLE CAVES IN EACH FRUIT WHICH THEY HAD EATEN OUT BEFORE STUPEFIED BY ITS SWEETNESS BY THE DOOR LAY CLYM'S FURZE HOOK
THOMASIN WAS PERFORCE CONTENT AND YOU WILL KEEP THE SECRET OF MY WOULD BE MARRIAGE FROM CLYM FOR THE PRESENT SHE NEXT ASKED
A STRATUM OF ENSAFFRONED LIGHT WAS IMPOSED ON A STRATUM OF DEEP BLUE AND BEHIND THESE LAY STILL REMOTER SCENES WRAPPED IN FRIGID GREY
BLOWN DOWN IN THE GALES OF PAST YEARS THE PLACE WAS CALLED THE DEVIL'S BELLOWS AND IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY TO COME THERE ON A MARCH OR NOVEMBER NIGHT TO DISCOVER THE FORCIBLE REASONS FOR THAT NAME
SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE WHAT A CLASS TO BELONG TO DO I REALLY BELONG TO THEM TIS ABSURD YET WHY AUNT DOES EVERYBODY KEEP ON MAKING ME THINK THAT I DO BY THE WAY THEY BEHAVE TOWARDS ME
THESE SAD AND HOPELESS OBSTACLES ARE WELCOME IN ONE SENSE FOR THEY ENABLE US TO LOOK WITH INDIFFERENCE UPON THE CRUEL SATIRES THAT FATE LOVES TO INDULGE IN
HAD UNDERGONE A SPECIES OF INCINERATION SINCE THE DROUGHT HAD SET IN
WHAT HAS HER LIFE BEEN HER SURNAME EVEN IS NOT HER TRUE ONE SHE IS CAPTAIN VYE'S GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER FATHER MERELY TOOK HER MOTHER'S NAME AND SHE IS A LADY BY INSTINCT
YES POOR MAID HER HEART HAS ACHED ENOUGH ABOUT IT HER HEALTH IS SUFFERING FROM IT I HEAR FOR SHE WILL BIDE ENTIRELY INDOORS WE NEVER SEE HER OUT NOW SCAMPERING OVER THE FURZE WITH A FACE AS RED AS A ROSE AS SHE USED TO DO
THEIR FATHERS COULDN'T DO IT AND THE COUNTRY WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR IT NOW I SHOULD THINK CAP'N THAT MISS EUSTACIA HAD ABOUT AS MUCH IN HER HEAD THAT COMES FROM BOOKS AS ANYBODY ABOUT HERE
SOUNDS OF VOICES IN CONVERSATION CAME TO HER EARS DIRECTLY DOWN THE CHIMNEY SHE ENTERED THE RECESS AND LISTENING LOOKED UP THE OLD IRREGULAR SHAFT WITH ITS CAVERNOUS HOLLOWS WHERE THE SMOKE BLUNDERED ABOUT
I KNEW SHE WAS SURE TO COME SHE VANISHED IN A HOLLOW FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN HER WHOLE FORM UNFOLDED ITSELF FROM THE BRAKE ONLY YOU HERE SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A DISAPPOINTED AIR WHOSE HOLLOWNESS WAS PROVED BY HER RISING REDNESS AND HER HALF GUILTY LOW LAUGH
WHEN CRACKS APPEARED IN CLAYEY GARDENS AND WERE CALLED EARTHQUAKES BY APPREHENSIVE CHILDREN WHEN LOOSE SPOKES WERE DISCOVERED IN THE WHEELS OF CARTS AND CARRIAGES AND WHEN STINGING INSECTS HAUNTED THE AIR
WHY SHOULD SHE NOT GO THAT WAY THE SCENE OF THE DAYDREAM IS SUFFICIENT FOR A PILGRIMAGE AT NINETEEN TO LOOK AT THE PALINGS BEFORE THE YEOBRIGHTS HOUSE HAD THE DIGNITY OF A NECESSARY PERFORMANCE
THAT WEAK GIRL HOW IS SHE GOING TO GET A MAN TO MARRY HER WHEN SHE CHOOSES BUT LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING AUNT
IF IF WE CAN WE CERTAINLY CAN BOTH BEING OF FULL AGE AND I HAVE NOT FOLLOWED MY OCCUPATION ALL THESE YEARS WITHOUT HAVING ACCUMULATED MONEY AND IF YOU WILL AGREE TO LIVE IN A TINY COTTAGE SOMEWHERE ON THE HEATH
MISSUS YEOBRIGHT STRAINED HER EYES AND AT LAST SAID THAT SHE DID PERCEIVE HIM
IN THE MINOR VALLEYS BETWEEN THE HILLOCKS WHICH DIVERSIFIED THE CONTOUR OF THE VALE THE FRESH YOUNG FERNS WERE LUXURIANTLY GROWING UP ULTIMATELY TO REACH A HEIGHT OF FIVE OR SIX FEET HE DESCENDED A LITTLE WAY
THAN AN INSECT HE APPEARED AS A MERE PARASITE OF THE HEATH
THE FURZE STACK WAS NOT FAR FROM THE CHIMNEY AND THE VOICES WERE THOSE OF THE WORKERS HER GRANDFATHER JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION
AT WHICH MYRIADS OF IMPRISONED SHAPES AROSE WHERE HAD PREVIOUSLY APPEARED THE STILLNESS OF A VOID
AS IT OFTEN APPEARS ON A FINE WINTER DAY IN DISTINCT PLANES OF ILLUMINATION INDEPENDENTLY TONED THE RAYS WHICH LIT THE NEARER TRACTS OF LANDSCAPE
THUS QUIETLY SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IN THE MORNING THAT HER COLOURLESS INNER WORLD WOULD BEFORE NIGHT BECOME AS ANIMATED AS WATER UNDER A MICROSCOPE AND THAT WITHOUT THE ARRIVAL OF A SINGLE VISITOR
STRANGERS DON'T SEE YOU AS I DO SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT THEY JUDGE FROM FALSE REPORT WELL IT IS A SILLY JOB AND I AM PARTLY TO BLAME HOW QUICKLY A RASH THING CAN BE DONE
IT IS THE ONLY WAY OUT OF A FALSE POSITION AND A VERY GALLING ONE WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM THAT HE WAS STANDING IN THE WAY OF ANOTHER LOVER OF YOURS AUNT
AND THE INCIPIENT MARKS OF TIME AND THOUGHT WERE LESS PERCEPTIBLE THAN WHEN HE RETURNED THE HEALTHFUL AND ENERGETIC STURDINESS WHICH WAS HIS BY NATURE HAVING PARTIALLY RECOVERED ITS ORIGINAL PROPORTIONS THEY WANDERED ONWARD TILL THEY REACHED THE NETHER MARGIN OF THE HEATH
A SMALL APPLE TREE OF THE SORT CALLED RATHERIPE GREW JUST INSIDE THE GATE THE ONLY ONE WHICH THROVE IN THE GARDEN BY REASON OF THE LIGHTNESS OF THE SOIL AND AMONG THE FALLEN APPLES ON THE GROUND BENEATH
AND BE NEITHER DRUNKARD NOR GLUTTON THEY SAY TOO THAT CLYM YEOBRIGHT IS BECOME A REAL PERUSING MAN WITH THE STRANGEST NOTIONS ABOUT THINGS THERE THAT'S BECAUSE HE WENT TO SCHOOL EARLY SUCH AS THE SCHOOL WAS
AND NOT THAT OF A PERSON COME ON BUSINESS OR BY INVITATION HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE WITH INTEREST AND THEN WALKED ROUND AND SCANNED THE OUTER BOUNDARY OF THE GARDEN AS ONE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD IT BEEN THE BIRTHPLACE OF SHAKESPEARE
THEY CALL HIM CAPTAIN BUT ANYBODY IS CAPTAIN HE WAS IN THE ROYAL NAVY NO DOUBT HE HAS BEEN TO SEA IN SOME TUB OR OTHER WHY DOESN'T HE LOOK AFTER HER
STRANGE NOTIONS HAS HE SAID THE OLD MAN AH THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THAT SENDING TO SCHOOL IN THESE DAYS IT ONLY DOES HARM
I CAN WELL MIND WHEN HE LEFT HOME SAID SAM TIS A GOOD THING FOR THE FELLER SAID HUMPHREY
ON ITS WAY TO THE SQUARE BIT OF SKY AT THE TOP FROM WHICH THE DAYLIGHT STRUCK DOWN WITH A PALLID GLARE UPON THE TATTERS OF SOOT DRAPING THE FLUE AS SEAWEED DRAPES A ROCKY FISSURE SHE REMEMBERED
WOULD HAVE APPEARED AS THE FERMENT OF STAGNATION MERELY A CREEPING OF THE FLESH OF SOMNOLENCE BUT HERE AWAY FROM COMPARISONS SHUT IN BY THE STABLE HILLS AMONG WHICH MERE WALKING
AS A MOTH FRETS A GARMENT ENTIRELY ENGROSSED WITH ITS PRODUCTS HAVING NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BUT FERN FURZE HEATH LICHENS AND MOSS
SAID THOMASIN WITH ROUND EYES WHAT DO YOU MEAN DON'T BE ALARMED IT WAS MY DUTY
SUNRISE HAD ADVANCED ITS QUARTERS FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHEAST SUNSET HAD RECEDED FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHWEST BUT EGDON HAD HARDLY HEEDED THE CHANGE
THERE IS NO CHANCE OF GETTING RICH BUT WITH MY SYSTEM OF EDUCATION WHICH IS AS NEW AS IT IS TRUE I SHALL DO A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD TO MY FELLOW CREATURES DREAMS DREAMS
MORE SINGULAR STILL THE HEATHMEN HAD INSTINCTIVELY COUPLED HER AND THIS MAN TOGETHER IN THEIR MINDS AS A PAIR BORN FOR EACH OTHER
SHE REPEATED SLOWLY WHICH IS NOT LIKELY DEAREST FIX THE EXACT DAY AND THEN THEY CONSULTED ON THE QUESTION AND THE DAY WAS CHOSEN IT WAS TO BE A FORTNIGHT FROM THAT TIME
THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HAPPY MEETING IS THERE ANY USE IN SAYING WHAT CAN DO NO GOOD AUNT YES SAID HER AUNT WITH SOME WARMTH TO THOROUGHLY FILL THE AIR WITH THE PAST MISFORTUNE
AN OLD IRREGULAR THATCHED HOUSE FACING THE HEATH AND COMMANDING A FULL VIEW OF THE VALLEY THIS WAS THE OBSCURE REMOVED SPOT TO WHICH WAS ABOUT TO RETURN A MAN WHOSE LATTER LIFE
THEY'VE CUT THE KING'S HEAD OFF JANE AND WHAT TWILL BE NEXT GOD KNOWS A GOOD MANY OF US KNEW AS WELL AS HE BEFORE LONG SAID THE CAPTAIN CHUCKLING I LIVED SEVEN YEARS UNDER WATER ON ACCOUNT OF IT IN MY BOYHOOD
WHAT A NUNNYWATCH WE WERE IN TO BE SURE WHEN WE HEARD THEY WEREN'T MARRIED AT ALL
SHE AND CLYM YEOBRIGHT WOULD MAKE A VERY PRETTY PIGEON PAIR HEY IF THEY WOULDN'T I'LL BE DAZED BOTH OF ONE MIND ABOUT NICETIES FOR CERTAIN AND LEARNED IN PRINT
I HAVE BEEN TOLD AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE THING SHE SAID MOURNFULLY THE CAPTAIN HAS LET OUT AT THE WOMAN THAT YOU AND EUSTACIA VYE ARE ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED WE ARE SAID YEOBRIGHT BUT IT MAY NOT BE YET FOR A VERY LONG TIME
WHICH HUMPHREY HAD BEEN CUTTING FOR THE CAPTAIN'S USE DURING THE FOREGOING FINE DAYS THE STACK WAS AT THE END OF THE DWELLING AND THE MEN ENGAGED IN BUILDING IT WERE HUMPHREY AND SAM THE OLD MAN LOOKING ON
AND BY AN INSTINCTIVE IMPULSE OF LOYALTY TOWARDS HER COUSIN CLYM TO BESTIR HERSELF ON HIS ACCOUNT WITH AN ALACRITY UNUSUAL IN HER DURING THESE MOST SORROWFUL DAYS OF HER LIFE
THE SUN SLOPING DOWN ON THEIR RIGHT AND THROWING THEIR THIN SPECTRAL SHADOWS TALL AS POPLAR TREES FAR OUT ACROSS THE FURZE AND FERN
SUDDENLY SHE WAS ATTRACTED TO HIS INDIVIDUALITY BY OBSERVING PECULIARITIES IN HIS WALK IT WAS A GAIT SHE HAD SEEN SOMEWHERE BEFORE AND THE GAIT REVEALED THE MAN TO HER AS THE GAIT OF AHIMAAZ IN THE DISTANT PLAIN
THAT FIVE MINUTES OF OVERHEARING FURNISHED EUSTACIA WITH VISIONS ENOUGH TO FILL THE WHOLE BLANK AFTERNOON SUCH SUDDEN ALTERNATIONS FROM MENTAL VACUITY DO SOMETIMES OCCUR
YOUR MOTHER WILL INFLUENCE YOU TOO MUCH I SHALL NOT BE JUDGED FAIRLY
YOU MAY THINK WHAT YOU CHOOSE I HAVE NEVER IMPLIED TO YOU BY WORD OR DEED THAT I HAVE GROWN TO THINK OTHERWISE OF HIM AND I NEVER WILL AND I SHALL MARRY HIM WELL WAIT TILL HE REPEATS HIS OFFER
HIS FEELINGS WERE HIGH THE MOMENT WAS PASSIONATE AND HE CUT THE KNOT YOU SHALL BE SURE OF ME DARLING HE SAID FOLDING HER IN HIS ARMS WE WILL BE MARRIED AT ONCE O CLYM DO YOU AGREE TO IT
CERTAIN EPHEMERAL OPERATIONS WERE APT TO DISTURB IN THEIR TRIFLING WAY THE MAJESTIC CALM OF EGDON HEATH THEY WERE ACTIVITIES WHICH BESIDE THOSE OF A TOWN A VILLAGE OR EVEN A FARM
THEY CANNOT NOBODY DARES TO SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF YOU OR OF ME OH HOW I WISH I WAS SURE OF NEVER LOSING YOU THAT YOU COULD NOT BE ABLE TO DESERT ME ANYHOW CLYM STOOD SILENT A MOMENT
COME DOWN AND WE'LL GO FOR THE HOLLY THERE IS NOBODY ON THE HEATH THIS AFTERNOON AND YOU NEED NOT FEAR BEING STARED AT WE MUST GET SOME BERRIES OR CLYM WILL NEVER BELIEVE IN OUR PREPARATIONS
TO GAZE UPON HER BEAUTY TO TALK AND LAUGH WITH HER AND NEVER WOULD HAVE LEFT HER SIDE IF HIS MOTHER HAD NOT FORCED HIM SOME TIME HAVING ELAPSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE LONG JOURNEY
THE PAINTINGS AND FURNITURE WERE OF ASTONISHING BEAUTY AND BETWEEN EACH WINDOW WAS A SILVER ARM HOLDING A CANDLE
WHILE THE KING READ THE LETTER HE CHANGED COLOUR HE WOULD INSTANTLY HAVE EXECUTED THE CALIPH'S ORDER BUT FIRST HE SHOWED THE LETTER TO SAOUY WHOSE INTERESTS WERE EQUALLY AT STAKE WITH HIS OWN
BY THE VIZIR'S ORDERS HIS BONDS WERE IMMEDIATELY UNDONE AND SAOUY WAS TIED WITH THE SAME CORDS
I TRAVELLED A CONSIDERABLE WAY OVERLAND AND FINALLY EMBARKED FROM A DISTANT INDIAN PORT WITH A CAPTAIN WHO MEANT TO MAKE A LONG VOYAGE AND TRULY HE DID SO FOR WE FELL IN WITH STORMY WEATHER WHICH DROVE US COMPLETELY OUT OF OUR COURSE SO THAT FOR MANY DAYS
I WAS AWARE THAT MY SON WAS BUILDING A TOMB AND I THINK I CAN FIND THE SPOT BUT AS HE WISHED TO KEEP THE MATTER SECRET LET US GO ALONE AND SEEK THE PLACE OURSELVES HE THEN BADE ME DISGUISE MYSELF AND WE BOTH SLIPPED OUT OF A GARDEN DOOR WHICH OPENED ON TO THE CEMETERY
PRINCESS PARIZADE TOOK THE PITCHER AND CARRYING WITH HER BESIDES THE CAGE THE TWIG AND THE FLASK RETURNED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AT EVERY BLACK STONE SHE STOPPED AND SPRINKLED IT WITH WATER
DECLARED THAT WE WERE IN THE MOST DANGEROUS SPOT UPON THE WHOLE WIDE SEA AND HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY A CURRENT WHICH WAS AT THAT MINUTE SWEEPING US TO DESTRUCTION IT WAS TOO TRUE IN SPITE OF ALL THE SAILORS COULD DO WE WERE DRIVEN WITH FRIGHTFUL RAPIDITY
BUT ALL THE SAME THE RISK IS GREAT GOOD DERVISH ANSWERED THE PRINCESS I FEEL IN MY HEART THAT I SHALL SUCCEED AND IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO ASK YOU THE WAY I AM TO GO
WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE PAVILION BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED CALLING THE GRAND VIZIR GIAFAR HE SAID TO HIM NEGLIGENT VIZIR LOOK AT THE PAVILION AND TELL ME WHY IT IS LIT UP WHEN I AM NOT THERE
SHE SAID WITH A DEEPER SIGH THAN BEFORE
MADAM SAID THE DERVISH THEY ARE FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY DESCRIPTION BUT YOU SEEM IGNORANT OF ALL THE DIFFICULTIES THAT STAND IN YOUR WAY OR YOU WOULD HARDLY HAVE UNDERTAKEN SUCH AN ADVENTURE
AND HAVE THE CORPSE OF THE HUNCHBACK PROPERLY BURIED I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS BARBER WHO HAS EARNED YOUR PARDON AND AS HE IS IN THIS TOWN LET AN USHER GO WITH YOU AT ONCE IN SEARCH OF HIM THE USHER AND THE TAILOR SOON RETURNED
TO THIS THE GENIUS ONLY REPLIED BY INSULTS AND BLOWS I COULD HEAR THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF THE PRINCESS AND HAVING BY THIS TIME TAKEN OFF MY RICH GARMENTS AND PUT ON THOSE IN WHICH I HAD ARRIVED THE PREVIOUS DAY I LIFTED THE TRAP FOUND MYSELF ONCE MORE IN THE FOREST
HE CRIED THAT WHILE I AM IN BAGDAD A MAN LIKE YOU SHOULD BE STARVING THAT IS A STATE OF THINGS THAT MUST AT ONCE BE PUT AN END TO NEVER SHALL IT BE SAID THAT I HAVE ABANDONED YOU AND I AM SURE THAT YOU ON YOUR PART WILL NEVER ABANDON ME
AS MUCH IRRITATED WITH ME AS EVER SO SAYING THE TAILOR WENT ON TO RELATE THE STORY OF THE LAME MAN AND THE BARBER WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN TOLD WHEN THE BARBER HE CONTINUED HAD FINISHED HIS TALE WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN RIGHT
AND PEOPLE CAME FROM FAR AND NEAR TO SEE AND ADMIRE AFTER A FEW DAYS PRINCE BAHMAN AND PRINCE PERVIZ FELL BACK INTO THEIR ORDINARY WAY OF LIFE AND PASSED MOST OF THEIR TIME HUNTING ONE DAY IT HAPPENED THAT THE SULTAN OF PERSIA WAS ALSO HUNTING IN THE SAME DIRECTION
THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN INCONSOLABLE AT HIS DEPARTURE
KISSING HER HAND THE BEAUTIFUL SLAVE SAID MADAM I DO NOT KNOW HOW YOU FIND ME IN THIS DRESS THAT YOU HAVE HAD PREPARED FOR ME YOUR WOMEN ASSURE ME THAT IT SUITS ME SO WELL THAT THEY HARDLY KNEW ME
FURTHER MY LORD IN SERENDIB NO JUDGE IS NEEDED FOR TO THE KING HIMSELF HIS PEOPLE COME FOR JUSTICE THE CALIPH WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY REPORT FROM THE KING'S LETTER SAID HE I JUDGED THAT HE WAS A WISE MAN
I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN ME SAID PRINCE BAHMAN AND FOR THE ADVICE YOU HAVE GIVEN THOUGH I CANNOT FOLLOW IT BUT WHAT DANGERS CAN THERE BE IN THE ADVENTURE WHICH COURAGE AND A GOOD SWORD CANNOT MEET
SINCE THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN HAD BEEN TO THE BATH FIVE OR SIX DAYS AFTER HER PURCHASE THE VIZIR'S WIFE GAVE ORDERS THAT THE BATH SHOULD BE HEATED FOR HER
SO THAT I MIGHT NEVER BE WITHOUT IT AFTER ORDERING A VARIETY OF DISHES WHICH NEVER CAME TO BE PLACED ON THE TABLE AND DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF EACH ONE THE BARMECIDE DECLARED THAT HAVING DINED SO WELL THEY WOULD NOW PROCEED TO TAKE THEIR WINE
SO SAYING WITH ONE SWEEP OF HIS SABRE HE CUT OFF A HAND OF THE PRINCESS
WHERE HAVE YOU HIDDEN YOUR MUSICIANS HE ASKED THE PRINCESS ARE THEY UP IN THE AIR OR UNDER THE EARTH SURELY THE OWNERS OF SUCH CHARMING VOICES OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES
AND POINT THEM OUT TO ME I BEG YOU FOR I WISH TO CARRY THEM AWAY FOR SOME REASON THAT THE PRINCESS COULD NOT GUESS THESE WORDS SEEMED TO DISPLEASE THE BIRD AND HE DID NOT ANSWER THE PRINCESS WAITED A MOMENT AND THEN CONTINUED IN SEVERE TONES
BUT IN CASE I SHOULD NEED HIS HELP AT ANY OTHER TIME I HAVE ONLY TO TOUCH A TALISMAN THAT STANDS AT THE ENTRANCE OF MY CHAMBER IT WANTS STILL FIVE DAYS TO HIS NEXT VISIT AND I HOPE THAT DURING THAT TIME YOU WILL DO ME THE HONOUR TO BE MY GUEST
AND DETERMINED AT ONCE TO USE EVERY MEANS IN HIS POWER TO RETAIN HER FOR HIMSELF THE PERSIAN WAS EQUALLY CAPTIVATED BY NOUREDDIN AND SAID TO HERSELF THE VIZIR DOES ME TOO GREAT HONOUR IN BUYING ME FOR THE KING
AND HAD THE GIFT OF CHARMING ALL WITH WHOM HE CAME IN CONTACT AS SOON AS HE SAW THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN THOUGH AWARE THAT SHE WAS DESTINED FOR THE KING HE LET HIMSELF BE CARRIED AWAY BY HER CHARMS
BY THIS TIME THE PRINCESS HAD RECOVERED FROM THE FIRST EMBARRASSMENT OF MEETING AND PROCEEDED TO MAKE HER SPEECH OF WELCOME
PRINCE PERVIZ RODE ON TO WARN HIS SISTER OF THEIR APPROACH THE MOMENT HIS HIGHNESS ENTERED THE COURTYARD THE PRINCESS FLUNG HERSELF AT HIS FEET BUT HE BENT AND RAISED HER AND GAZED AT HER FOR SOME TIME STRUCK WITH HER GRACE AND BEAUTY
AND IS FITTINGLY DRESSED YOU WILL SEE HOW MUCH HER BEAUTY WILL BE INCREASED
THEY LOOK SO DISTINGUISHED AND ARE ABOUT THE SAME AGE THAT HIS SONS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SULTAN COMMANDED THAT SPLENDID APARTMENTS SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THE TWO BROTHERS AND EVEN INSISTED THAT THEY SHOULD SIT AT TABLE WITH HIM
OF TELLING ANY ONE WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME FOR THE PRINCE WHO GOVERNS THE KINGDOM IS YOUR FATHER'S GREATEST ENEMY AND HE WILL BE REJOICED TO FIND YOU IN HIS POWER I THANKED THE TAILOR FOR HIS COUNSEL AND SAID I WOULD DO WHATEVER HE ADVISED THEN BEING VERY HUNGRY
UNPERCEIVED BY ANYONE HE TORE OFF THE FORMULA FROM THE TOP OF THE LETTER PUT IT TO HIS MOUTH AND SWALLOWED IT THEN TURNING TO THE KING HE SAID
AS I HAD PROMISED I PREPARED TO DO AS I WAS TOLD AND GIVING MY HAND TO THE LADY I ESCORTED HER BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON TO THE PLACE OF WHICH THE PRINCE HAD SPOKEN WE HAD BARELY REACHED IT WHEN HE JOINED US HIMSELF CARRYING A SMALL VESSEL OF WATER
TOWARDS THE FOOT OF A MOUNTAIN WHICH ROSE SHEER OUT OF THE SEA AND OUR VESSEL WAS DASHED TO PIECES UPON THE ROCKS AT ITS BASE NOT HOWEVER UNTIL WE HAD MANAGED TO SCRAMBLE ON SHORE CARRYING WITH US THE MOST PRECIOUS OF OUR POSSESSIONS WHEN WE HAD DONE THIS THE CAPTAIN SAID TO US
AS IN THE CASE OF HIS BROTHER THE DERVISH TRIED TO MAKE HIM GIVE UP HIS PROJECT AND EVEN TOLD HIM THAT ONLY A FEW WEEKS SINCE A YOUNG MAN BEARING A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO HIMSELF HAD PASSED THAT WAY BUT HAD NEVER COME BACK AGAIN
HERE THE SULTAN PRESENTED THEM TO THE SULTANA ONE BY ONE AND FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS NOTHING BUT EMBRACES AND TEARS AND TENDER WORDS THEN THEY ATE OF THE MAGNIFICENT DINNER WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THEM
AND NOTHING REMAINED OF THE FISHERMAN BUT HIS CLOTHES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
THE SULTAN OF KASHGAR LISTENED WITH AN AIR OF PLEASURE WHICH FILLED THE TAILOR AND HIS FRIENDS WITH HOPE I MUST CONFESS HE EXCLAIMED THAT I AM MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN THE STORIES OF THE BARBER AND HIS BROTHERS AND OF THE LAME MAN THAN IN THAT OF MY OWN JESTER
I LOADED MY PACK ANIMALS AND JOINED A CARAVAN OF MERCHANTS OUR JOURNEY WAS LONG AND TEDIOUS BUT I BORE IT PATIENTLY
DO NOT SUPPOSE REPLIED HER HUSBAND THAT IT IS THE LOSS OF THE MONEY THAT AFFECTS ME MY HONOUR IS AT STAKE AND THAT IS MORE PRECIOUS TO ME THAN ALL MY WEALTH YOU KNOW THAT SAOUY IS MY MORTAL ENEMY
EVEN ON THE FIRST DAY I CUT ENOUGH WOOD TO SELL FOR A TOLERABLE SUM AND VERY SOON I BECAME MORE EXPERT AND HAD MADE ENOUGH MONEY TO REPAY THE TAILOR ALL HE HAD LENT ME I HAD BEEN A WOOD CUTTER FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WHEN
AND LIVED LONG IN GREAT HAPPINESS WITH THE FAIR PERSIAN AS TO THE KING
BUT THEY FOUND TO THEIR SORROW THAT HE WAS DEAD WHETHER FROM OLD AGE OR WHETHER FROM THE FEELING THAT HIS TASK WAS DONE THEY NEVER KNEW AS THEY CONTINUED THEIR ROAD THEIR NUMBERS GREW DAILY SMALLER FOR THE KNIGHTS TURNED OFF ONE BY ONE TO THEIR OWN HOMES
AND WE SHUDDERED TO THINK HOW SOON OUR OWN WOULD BE ADDED TO THE HEAP ALL AROUND TOO LAY VAST QUANTITIES OF THE COSTLIEST MERCHANDISE AND TREASURES WERE HEAPED IN EVERY CRANNY OF THE ROCKS BUT ALL THESE THINGS ONLY ADDED TO THE DESOLATION OF THE SCENE
WE TOOK THE LIBERTY OF KNOCKING AND OF ASKING FOR SHELTER WHICH WAS GIVEN TO US AT ONCE WITH THE BEST GRACE IN THE WORLD THIS MADAM IS MY STORY I AM SATISFIED REPLIED ZOBEIDA YOU CAN GO WHEN YOU LIKE
THAT WHEN IT BECAME A SKELETON MY MASTER MIGHT RETURN AND SECURE ITS TUSKS FOR TWO MONTHS I HUNTED THUS AND NO DAY PASSED WITHOUT MY SECURING AN ELEPHANT OF COURSE I DID NOT ALWAYS STATION MYSELF IN THE SAME TREE BUT SOMETIMES IN ONE PLACE SOMETIMES IN ANOTHER
RISE I FORGIVE THEE THEN TURNING TO THE PERSIAN HE SAID FAIR LADY NOW YOU KNOW WHO I AM LEARN ALSO THAT I HAVE SENT NOUREDDIN TO BALSORA TO BE KING AND AS SOON AS ALL NECESSARY PREPARATIONS ARE MADE
I ASKED THE OFFICERS IN COMMAND THE REASON OF THIS STRANGE BEHAVIOUR AND WAS HORRIFIED TO LEARN THAT THE ARMY HAD MUTINIED AND PUT TO DEATH THE KING MY FATHER
BUT THEIR HEARTS WERE NOT SO HARD AS THEY SEEMED AND MY TEARS AND PRAYERS MADE THEM WAVER FORSAKE THE KINGDOM INSTANTLY SAID THE EXECUTIONER AT LAST AND TAKE CARE NEVER TO COME BACK FOR YOU WILL NOT ONLY LOSE YOUR HEAD BUT MAKE US LOSE OURS
BEARER OF THIS LETTER HAS GIVEN IT TO THEE AND THOU HAST READ IT TAKE OFF THY ROYAL MANTLE PUT IT ON HIS SHOULDERS AND SEAT HIM IN THY PLACE WITHOUT FAIL FAREWELL
WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S DELAY HE SENT FOR THE GRAND VIZIR AND ORDERED HIM TO SEIZE AND QUESTION THE SULTANA'S SISTERS THAT VERY DAY THIS WAS DONE THEY WERE CONFRONTED WITH EACH OTHER AND PROVED GUILTY AND WERE EXECUTED IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
SO SAYING HE GAVE ME A SUPPLY OF FOOD AND RETURNED TO THE TOWN AND I PERCHED MYSELF HIGH UP IN THE TREE AND KEPT WATCH THAT NIGHT I SAW NOTHING BUT JUST AFTER SUNRISE THE NEXT MORNING A LARGE HERD OF ELEPHANTS CAME CRASHING AND TRAMPLING BY
FURTHER THAT BY HIS ORDERS I WAS PLACED UNDER ARREST
AND THEN THE LENGTH OF EACH MAN'S LIFE DEPENDED ON THE TIME HE COULD MAKE HIS PORTION LAST I MYSELF COULD LIVE UPON VERY LITTLE NEVERTHELESS
THE YOUNG MEN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND BLUSHED AT LAST PRINCE BAHMAN SAID SIRE WE MUST THROW OURSELVES ON YOUR HIGHNESS'S MERCY NEITHER MY BROTHER NOR MYSELF REMEMBERED ANYTHING ABOUT IT
THAT MY SON WAS TENDERLY ATTACHED TO THIS LADY WHOM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE SHOULD EVER MARRY I TRIED TO TURN HIS THOUGHTS AND PRESENTED TO HIM THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PRINCESSES BUT HE CARED FOR NONE OF THEM AND AS YOU SEE
BUT AS IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT BE FRIGHTENED BY THE VOICES
NOW THE SULTAN OF THE INDIES CURIOUS TO SEE A YOUNG PRINCE WITH SUCH STRANGE TASTES SENT AN AMBASSADOR TO MY FATHER LADEN WITH RICH PRESENTS AND A WARM INVITATION TO VISIT HIS COURT
AND MAKING PRISONERS OF THOSE WHO WERE PRUDENT ENOUGH TO SUBMIT AT ONCE OF WHOM I WAS ONE WHEN THEY HAD DESPOILED US OF ALL WE POSSESSED THEY FORCED US TO PUT ON VILE RAIMENT AND SAILING TO A DISTANT ISLAND THERE SOLD US FOR SLAVES
WHO HAD STRICT ORDERS TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHOM HE ADMITTED AND NEVER TO ALLOW ANY ONE TO SIT ON THE SOFAS BY THE DOOR IT HAPPENED THAT EVENING THAT HE HAD GONE OUT ON AN ERRAND
HE AND HIS HORSE WERE TWO BLACK STONES NOT A MORNING HAD PASSED SINCE PRINCE PERVIZ HAD RIDDEN AWAY WITHOUT PRINCESS PARIZADE TELLING HER BEADS AND AT NIGHT SHE EVEN HUNG THEM ROUND HER NECK SO THAT IF SHE WOKE SHE COULD ASSURE HERSELF AT ONCE OF HER BROTHER'S SAFETY
FOR THE BARMECIDES WERE FAMED FOR THEIR LIBERALITY AND GENEROSITY MY BROTHER HEARING THIS ASKED THE PORTERS OF WHOM THERE WERE SEVERAL IF THEY WOULD GIVE HIM ALMS
ONLY THE DOOR KEEPER LIVED THERE
ON THE SEASHORE AND AT THE MOUTHS OF THE RIVERS THE DIVERS SEEK FOR PEARLS AND IN SOME VALLEYS DIAMONDS ARE PLENTIFUL AFTER MANY DAYS I PETITIONED THE KING THAT I MIGHT RETURN TO MY OWN COUNTRY TO WHICH HE GRACIOUSLY CONSENTED MOREOVER HE LOADED ME WITH RICH GIFTS
AND WAS COME TO SEIZE THE KINGDOM OF MY UNCLE THE CAPITAL WAS UTTERLY UNPREPARED TO STAND A SIEGE AND SEEING THAT RESISTANCE WAS USELESS AT ONCE OPENED ITS GATES MY UNCLE FOUGHT HARD FOR HIS LIFE BUT WAS SOON OVERPOWERED AND WHEN HE FELL
THE HUNT BEGAN AND CONTINUED TILL MID DAY WHEN THE HEAT BECAME SO GREAT THAT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO LEAVE OFF
THE TWO PRINCES RETURNED HOME BUT THEIR ADVENTURE MADE SO LITTLE IMPRESSION ON THEM THAT THEY QUITE FORGOT TO SPEAK TO THEIR SISTER ON THE SUBJECT THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THEY WENT TO HUNT THEY MET THE SULTAN IN THE SAME PLACE AND HE INQUIRED WHAT ADVICE THEIR SISTER HAD GIVEN
AND IT IS I WHO HAVE KILLED YOU FOOL THAT I WAS TO LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THAT TEMPTRESS
NOT ONLY AS BROTHERS AND SISTER BUT AS HAVING IN YOU THE BLOOD ROYAL OF PERSIA WHICH COULD FLOW IN NO NOBLER VEINS WHEN THE FIRST MOMENTS OF EMOTION WERE OVER THE SULTAN HASTENED TO FINISH HIS REPAST AND THEN TURNING TO HIS CHILDREN HE EXCLAIMED
AND THAT THE AMBASSADOR AND ALL OUR FOLLOWERS WERE MADE PRISONERS I PUT SPURS TO MY HORSE AND RODE AWAY AS FAST AS I COULD TILL THE POOR BEAST FELL DEAD FROM A WOUND IN HIS SIDE I MANAGED TO JUMP OFF WITHOUT ANY INJURY AND LOOKED ABOUT TO SEE IF I WAS PURSUED
AND AS SOON AS IT CAME NEAR WE FOUND THAT THE DUST CONCEALED A BAND OF FIFTY ROBBERS OUR MEN BARELY NUMBERED HALF
ATTENDED ONLY BY A SMALL SUITE ON ACCOUNT OF THE LENGTH OF THE JOURNEY AND THE BADNESS OF THE ROADS HOWEVER AS WAS MY DUTY I TOOK WITH ME TEN CAMELS LADEN WITH RICH PRESENTS FOR THE SULTAN
AND ALOUD HE COMPLIMENTED THEM ON THEIR LEARNING AND TASTE FOR KNOWLEDGE
THE PRINCES MUST ON NO ACCOUNT REFUSE THE SULTAN'S PROPOSAL SAID HE AND THEY MUST EVEN INVITE HIM TO COME AND SEE YOUR HOUSE BUT BIRD OBJECTED THE PRINCESS YOU KNOW HOW DEARLY WE LOVE EACH OTHER
I BEG YOU TO GET US SOMETHING TO EAT THAT WE MAY MAKE MERRY TOGETHER BEING VERY AVARICIOUS SCHEIH IBRAHIM DETERMINED TO SPEND ONLY THE TENTH PART OF THE MONEY AND TO KEEP THE REST TO HIMSELF
I THEREFORE LOST NO TIME IN TELLING MY UNCLE EVERYTHING I KNEW AND I OBSERVED THAT EVEN BEFORE I HAD ENDED HIS SORROW APPEARED TO BE LIGHTENED A LITTLE MY DEAR NEPHEW HE SAID YOUR STORY GIVES ME SOME HOPE
DETERMINED TO WATCH AND SEE WHO THE PEOPLE WERE AND WHAT THEY DID PRESENTLY SCHEIH IBRAHIM ASKED THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN IF ANYTHING WERE WANTING TO COMPLETE HER ENJOYMENT OF THE EVENING IF ONLY SHE SAID
THE VERY LAST TIME I SAW HIM HE SEEMED MORE DELIGHTED TO SEE ME THAN EVER AND GAVE A GREAT FEAST IN MY HONOUR WHEN WE HAD FINISHED EATING HE SAID TO ME MY COUSIN YOU WOULD NEVER GUESS WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE YOUR LAST VISIT TO US
WHO WHEN I HAD FINISHED BURST INTO FITS OF LAUGHTER WELL WERE YOU CALLED THE SILENT SAID HE NO NAME WAS EVER BETTER DESERVED
AND SUPPOSE ANSWERED THE DERVISH THAT YOUR ENEMIES ARE INVISIBLE HOW THEN NOTHING WILL MAKE ME GIVE IT UP REPLIED THE PRINCE AND FOR THE LAST TIME I ASK YOU TO TELL ME WHERE I AM TO GO
BUT WITH MANY THANKS FOR THE HONOUR DONE THEM THEY BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED AND TO BE SUFFERED TO REMAIN AT HOME THE SULTAN WHO WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIS OFFERS REJECTED INQUIRED THEIR REASONS AND PRINCE BAHMAN EXPLAINED THAT THEY DID NOT WISH TO LEAVE THEIR SISTER
WHAT SAID THE KING IS THAT WRETCH STILL ALIVE GO AND BEHEAD HIM AT ONCE I AUTHORISE YOU SIRE
FOR LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND GOLD PIECES HE WILL NOT LET HER GO HE DECLARES THAT WHAT WITH MASTERS FOR HER INSTRUCTION AND FOR BODILY EXERCISES NOT TO SPEAK OF CLOTHING AND NOURISHMENT HE HAS ALREADY SPENT THAT SUM UPON HER
YOU ALONE HAVE ESCAPED THE WILES OF THESE ANIMALS THEREFORE YOU MUST BE UNDER THE SPECIAL PROTECTION OF HEAVEN NOW THROUGH YOU THE WHOLE TOWN WILL BE ENRICHED WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS OF LIFE THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT ONLY RECEIVE YOUR LIBERTY BUT I WILL ALSO BESTOW A FORTUNE UPON YOU
BY THE TIME I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF MY COMPANIONS MY STOCK OF PROVISIONS WAS SO SMALL THAT I HARDLY THOUGHT I SHOULD LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO DIG MY OWN GRAVE WHICH I SET ABOUT DOING WHILE I REGRETTED BITTERLY THE ROVING DISPOSITION
BUT TIME TEACHES US SUBMISSION AND I HAVE NOW GOT ACCUSTOMED TO HIS PRESENCE AND IF CLOTHES AND JEWELS COULD CONTENT ME I HAVE THEM IN PLENTY EVERY TENTH DAY FOR FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS I HAVE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HIM
PERSECUTED BY ILL FORTUNE AND STRICKEN WITH GRIEF
AND IT WAS AS BEFORE ON THE TWENTIETH DAY THAT SHE ARRIVED AT THE PLACE WHERE THE DERVISH WAS SITTING GOOD DERVISH SHE SAID POLITELY WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO REST BY YOU FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND PERHAPS YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS TO TELL ME IF YOU HAVE EVER HEARD OF A TALKING BIRD
WHAT WAS MY NAME I AM SINDBAD I REPLIED WHOM MEN CALL THE SAILOR FOR I HAVE VOYAGED MUCH UPON MANY SEAS AND HOW COME YOU HERE ASKED THE KING I TOLD MY STORY CONCEALING NOTHING
THE PRINCESS WAS OF COURSE MOST ANXIOUS TO ENTERTAIN THE SULTAN IN A FITTING WAY BUT AS SHE HAD NO EXPERIENCE IN COURT CUSTOMS SHE RAN TO THE TALKING BIRD AND BEGGED HE WOULD ADVISE HER AS TO WHAT DISHES SHOULD BE SERVED MY DEAR MISTRESS REPLIED THE BIRD
SHE ASKED AGAIN WITH A SIGH I HAVE BEEN IN THIS PLACE NOW FOR FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS AND YOU ARE THE FIRST MAN WHO HAS VISITED ME EMBOLDENED BY HER BEAUTY AND GENTLENESS I VENTURED TO REPLY BEFORE MADAM I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION
AND ON HIS ARRIVAL THERE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE OF THE KING OF WHOM HE DEMANDED AN AUDIENCE IT WAS IMMEDIATELY GRANTED AND HOLDING THE LETTER HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD HE FORCED HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD
SCHEIH IBRAHIM WHATEVER IS IN THE PURSE I WILL SHARE EQUALLY WITH YOU BUT AS TO THE SLAVE I WILL KEEP HER FOR MYSELF IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE CONDITIONS YOU SHALL HAVE NOTHING
I SHOULD BE NO WORSE OFF THAN I WAS NOW FOR DEATH STARED ME IN THE FACE WHILE THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT AS I WAS BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR I MIGHT FIND MYSELF SAFE AND SOUND IN SOME DESIRABLE LAND I DECIDED AT ANY RATE TO RISK IT
BEFORE HE COULD PROCEED FURTHER HE WAS STOPPED BY THE ASTONISHMENT SHOWN BY THE BARMECIDE
AH POOR SINDBAD HE CRIED I WAS WONDERING WHAT COULD HAVE BECOME OF YOU WHEN I WENT TO THE FOREST I FOUND THE TREE NEWLY UPROOTED AND THE ARROWS LYING BESIDE IT AND I FEARED I SHOULD NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN PRAY
IT WAS DURING THIS INTERVAL THAT THE LITTLE HUNCHBACK HALF DRUNK ALREADY PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE ME SINGING AND PLAYING ON HIS DRUM I TOOK HIM HOME TO AMUSE MY WIFE AND SHE INVITED HIM TO SUPPER WHILE EATING SOME FISH A BONE GOT INTO HIS THROAT AND IN SPITE OF ALL WE COULD DO
I AT LAST DECIDED TO RETURN HOME LEAVING THE MINISTERS TO MAKE MY EXCUSES I LONGED TO TELL THEM WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE PRINCE ABOUT WHOSE FATE THEY FELT THE MOST DREADFUL ANXIETY BUT THE OATH I HAD SWORN KEPT ME SILENT
AND THE VIZIR AND THE FOUR SLAVES ENTERING TOOK OFF THE FISHERMAN'S DRESS AND PUT ON HIM THAT WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT WHEN SCHEIH IBRAHIM RETURNED A THICK STICK IN HIS HAND
BE NOT SURPRISED TO SEE US THIS IS OUR LAND AND AS WE CAME TO GET WATER FROM THE RIVER WE NOTICED YOUR RAFT FLOATING DOWN IT AND ONE OF US SWAM OUT AND BROUGHT YOU TO THE SHORE WE HAVE WAITED FOR YOUR AWAKENING TELL US NOW WHENCE YOU COME AND WHERE YOU WERE GOING BY THAT DANGEROUS WAY
AT MY FATHER'S DESIRE I WAS MARRIED TO A PRINCE WHO WAS MY OWN COUSIN BUT ON MY VERY WEDDING DAY I WAS SNATCHED UP BY A GENIUS AND BROUGHT HERE IN A FAINT FOR A LONG WHILE I DID NOTHING BUT WEEP AND WOULD NOT SUFFER THE GENIUS TO COME NEAR ME
AS SCHACABAC POINTED OUT IT WAS QUITE USELESS TROUBLE AS HIS RELATIONS WERE AS POOR AS HIMSELF AT LENGTH THE BEDOUIN GREW TIRED OF TORMENTING AND SENT HIM ON A CAMEL TO THE TOP OF A HIGH BARREN MOUNTAIN WHERE HE LEFT HIM TO TAKE HIS CHANCE
BUT FISHING WAS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN IT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT HOWEVER THAT A FISHERMAN HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE GATE BEING OPEN TO GO IN AND CAST HIS NETS HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO DRAW THEM WHEN HE SAW THE CALIPH APPROACHING
THEY HAVE NOW BEEN UNITED BY A HORRIBLE DEATH IN AN UNDERGROUND TOMB BUT AS HE SPOKE HIS ANGER MELTED INTO TEARS AND AGAIN I WEPT WITH HIM WHEN HE RECOVERED HIMSELF HE DREW ME TO HIM MY DEAR NEPHEW HE SAID EMBRACING ME
THE KING OF THE INDIES BEFORE WHOM WALK A THOUSAND ELEPHANTS WHO LIVES IN A PALACE OF WHICH THE ROOF BLAZES WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND RUBIES AND WHOSE TREASURE HOUSE CONTAINS TWENTY THOUSAND DIAMOND CROWNS TO THE CALIPH HAROUN AL RASCHID SENDS GREETING
MY FATHER WHO WAS DEEPLY ANXIOUS TO SECURE THE FRIENDSHIP OF SO POWERFUL A MONARCH AND HELD BESIDES THAT A LITTLE TRAVEL WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE MY MANNERS AND OPEN MY MIND ACCEPTED GLADLY AND IN A SHORT TIME I HAD SET OUT FOR INDIA WITH THE AMBASSADOR
HE THOUGHT THAT FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSE IT MIGHT YIELD HIM A RICH HARVEST SO HE ENTERED AND INQUIRED TO WHOM IT BELONGED MY GOOD MAN WHERE DO YOU COME FROM REPLIED THE SERVANT CAN'T YOU SEE FOR YOURSELF THAT IT CAN BELONG TO NOBODY BUT A BARMECIDE
SIRE ANSWERED THE PRINCESS DO YOU SEE THAT CAGE HANGING IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE SALOON THAT IS THE TALKING BIRD WHOSE VOICE YOU CAN HEAR ABOVE THEM ALL EVEN ABOVE THAT OF THE NIGHTINGALE
AND WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER OBJECT IN DOING SO
COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL YOUR MISERABLE SLAVE HAS OFFENDED YOU AND CRAVES FORGIVENESS
NOW WE ARE HERE WE MAY AS WELL BEGIN TO DIG OUR GRAVES AT ONCE SINCE FROM THIS FATAL SPOT NO SHIPWRECKED MARINER HAS EVER RETURNED THIS SPEECH DISCOURAGED US MUCH AND WE BEGAN TO LAMENT OVER OUR SAD FATE
THIS RIVER WHICH HID ITSELF UNDERGROUND DOUBTLESS EMERGED AGAIN AT SOME DISTANT SPOT WHY SHOULD I NOT BUILD A RAFT AND TRUST MYSELF TO ITS SWIFTLY FLOWING WATERS IF I PERISHED BEFORE I COULD REACH THE LIGHT OF DAY ONCE MORE
HIS WIFE TRIED TO CONSOLE HIM SAYING DO NOT TORMENT THYSELF WITH THE SALE OF MY JEWELS I WILL OBTAIN TEN THOUSAND GOLD PIECES AND WITH THIS SUM
WHEN THE VIZIR SAW
NOUREDDIN ON BEING AWOKE TOLD THE OLD MAN THAT THEY WERE STRANGERS AND MERELY WISHED TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE COME WITH ME SAID SCHEIH IBRAHIM I WILL LODGE YOU BETTER AND WILL SHOW YOU A MAGNIFICENT GARDEN BELONGING TO ME
WHEN HE TOUCHED THE GROUND HE RAPPED IT WITH HIS FOOT IT OPENED AND WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE ENCHANTED PALACE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS OF THE EBONY ISLE BUT HOW DIFFERENT SHE LOOKED FROM WHAT SHE WAS WHEN I HAD LAST SEEN HER
BUT WAS PERSUADED TO ENTER THE ROOM TO SIT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF THE SOFA NEAREST THE DOOR AND AT LAST TO DRAW CLOSER AND TO SEAT HIMSELF BY THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN WHO URGED HIM SO PERSISTENTLY TO DRINK HER HEALTH THAT AT LENGTH HE YIELDED
IT CONSISTS OF A STUFFED CUCUMBER AND THE STUFFING IS TO BE MADE OF THESE PEARLS THE HEAD COOK WHO HAD NEVER IN ALL HIS EXPERIENCE HEARD OF SUCH A DISH STEPPED BACK IN AMAZEMENT YOU THINK I AM MAD
AND USUALLY STAYED THERE ABOUT TWO MONTHS IN THIS WAY MY COUSIN AND I BECAME VERY INTIMATE
AND DRAWING THE SULTANA WITH HIS OWN HAND OUT OF THE NARROW PRISON WHERE SHE HAD SPENT SO MANY YEARS MADAM HE CRIED EMBRACING HER WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES I HAVE COME TO ASK YOUR PARDON FOR THE INJUSTICE I HAVE DONE YOU AND TO REPAIR IT AS FAR AS I MAY
THEN HE TURNED AND WENT UP THE STAIRS WE REACHED THE PALACE WITHOUT ANYONE HAVING NOTICED OUR ABSENCE WHEN SHORTLY AFTER A CLASHING OF DRUMS AND CYMBALS AND THE BLARE OF TRUMPETS BURST UPON OUR ASTONISHED EARS
HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND IMMEDIATELY INVENTED AN EXCUSE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL HE SAID I MUST TELL YOU THAT FOUR OR FIVE DAYS AGO SCHEIH IBRAHIM TOLD ME THAT HE WISHED TO HAVE AN ASSEMBLY OF THE MINISTERS OF HIS MOSQUE
I HAD INDEED GOOD REASON FOR MY TERROR WHEN AN INSTANT LATER THE LARGEST OF THE ANIMALS WOUND HIS TRUNK ROUND THE STEM OF MY TREE AND WITH ONE MIGHTY EFFORT TORE IT UP BY THE ROOTS BRINGING ME TO THE GROUND ENTANGLED IN ITS BRANCHES
WHAT SHE WOULD DO IN SUCH A CASE AND THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE PRINCESS DISGUISED AS A MAN SET OUT FOR THE MOUNTAIN AS SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RIDING FROM HER CHILDHOOD SHE MANAGED TO TRAVEL AS MANY MILES DAILY AS HER BROTHERS HAD DONE
AND NOW MY TASK BEING ACCOMPLISHED I WAS ANXIOUS TO DEPART
BECAUSE ONCE WHEN SHOOTING AT A BIRD WITH A BOW I HAD SHOT OUT HIS EYE BY ACCIDENT
AND DRESSED IN A GARMENT OUT OF HIS OWN WARDROBE TWENTY YEARS PASSED BY AND MY BROTHER WAS STILL LIVING WITH THE BARMECIDE LOOKING AFTER HIS HOUSE AND MANAGING HIS AFFAIRS AT THE END OF THAT TIME HIS GENEROUS BENEFACTOR DIED WITHOUT HEIRS
BUT MADAM INQUIRED THE PERSIAN WHAT HARM IS THERE IN THAT HOW
THE BIRD DESCRIBED THE PLACE WHICH WAS NOT FAR DISTANT AND THE PRINCESS FILLED A SMALL SILVER FLASK THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER FOR THE PURPOSE SHE THEN RETURNED TO THE CAGE AND SAID BIRD THERE IS STILL SOMETHING ELSE WHERE SHALL I FIND THE SINGING TREE
TO CUT OFF MY HEAD AND THEN TO ABANDON MY BODY TO THE BIRDS OF PREY THE CASE WITH ME INSIDE IT WAS ACCORDINGLY PLACED ON A HORSE AND THE EXECUTIONER ACCOMPANIED BY ANOTHER MAN
AFTER I HAD SALUTED HIM THE CALIPH SAID I HAVE SENT FOR YOU SINDBAD BECAUSE I NEED YOUR SERVICES
AT THIS THE BARMECIDE INSTEAD OF BEING ANGRY BEGAN TO LAUGH AND EMBRACED HIM HEARTILY I HAVE LONG BEEN SEEKING HE EXCLAIMED A MAN OF YOUR DESCRIPTION AND HENCEFORTH MY HOUSE SHALL BE YOURS
BUT THE LOOK OF GRATITUDE SHE GAVE ME SHOOK MY COURAGE AND I FLUNG THE SABRE TO THE EARTH I SHOULD NOT DESERVE TO LIVE I SAID TO THE GENIUS IF I WERE SUCH A COWARD AS TO SLAY A LADY WHO IS NOT ONLY UNKNOWN TO ME BUT WHO IS AT THIS MOMENT HALF DEAD HERSELF
I GAVE ONE KICK TO THE TALISMAN AND IT FELL INTO A THOUSAND PIECES HARDLY HAD MY FOOT TOUCHED THE TALISMAN WHEN THE AIR BECAME AS DARK AS NIGHT A FEARFUL NOISE WAS HEARD AND THE PALACE SHOOK TO ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS IN AN INSTANT I WAS SOBERED AND UNDERSTOOD WHAT I HAD DONE
INQUIRED IF THERE WAS ANYTHING I COULD DO FOR MY LIVING
GENTLE DERVISH REPLIED PRINCE BAHMAN I COME FROM FAR AND I SEEK THE TALKING BIRD THE SINGING TREE AND THE GOLDEN WATER I KNOW THAT THEY ARE TO BE FOUND SOMEWHERE IN THESE PARTS
AND THE KNIGHTS WHO STOOD BY DECLARED THEMSELVES HER SLAVES AND READY TO CARRY OUT HER WISHES BUT THE PRINCESS WHILE THANKING THEM FOR THEIR POLITENESS EXPLAINED THAT SHE WISHED FOR NO COMPANY BUT THAT OF HER BROTHERS
THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH A GENIUS TREATS THE WOMAN WHO HAS BETRAYED HIM IF I CHOSE I COULD KILL YOU ALSO BUT I WILL BE MERCIFUL AND CONTENT MYSELF WITH CHANGING YOU INTO A DOG AN ASS A LION OR A BIRD WHICHEVER YOU PREFER
HE IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MAN I AM SURE THE BIRD AND THE CAGE MUST HAVE BEEN KEPT FOR HIM
WOULD TO HEAVEN EXCLAIMED THE WIFE OF THE VIZIR THAT WHAT YOU SAY WERE TRUE BUT NOUREDDIN HAS DECEIVED YOU AND HIS FATHER WILL SACRIFICE HIM IN VENGEANCE FOR THE WRONG HE HAS DONE
OF WHOM HE NEVER CEASED TO SPEAK EVIL TO THE KING ONE DAY WHILE THE KING AMUSED HIMSELF TALKING WITH HIS TWO VIZIRS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL THE CONVERSATION TURNED ON FEMALE SLAVES
IS IT NOT JUST THAT I SHOULD NOW ENJOY A LIFE OF EASE AND TRANQUILLITY
ASKED AS A FURTHER FAVOUR IF THE LADY WOULD PLAY HIM ONE PIECE ON THE LUTE
COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL SAID THE VIZIR
I VENTURED TO SAY THAT I MYSELF AND ALL THAT I HAD WERE AT HIS DISPOSAL BUT HE ANSWERED ME SMILING NAY SINDBAD
ON MY ARRIVAL AT MY FATHER'S CAPITAL I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND A LARGE DETACHMENT OF GUARDS DRAWN UP BEFORE THE GATE OF THE PALACE
ON APPROACHING THE HOUSE THE SULTAN NOTICED A VAST QUANTITY OF BIRDS WHOSE VOICES FILLED THE AIR
AND HIS SURPRISE AND DELIGHT WERE SO GREAT THAT HE ORDERED MY ADVENTURES TO BE WRITTEN IN LETTERS OF GOLD AND LAID UP IN THE ARCHIVES OF HIS KINGDOM
FOR THOSE STONES ARE IN REALITY MEN LIKE YOURSELF WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE SAME QUEST AND HAVE FAILED AS I FEAR THAT YOU MAY FAIL ALSO IF YOU MANAGE TO AVOID THIS PITFALL AND TO REACH THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YOU WILL FIND THERE
AFTER SOME TIME HE GREW BEWILDERED HIS KNEES BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND FINDING HIMSELF IN THE ACT OF FALLING HE FORGOT ALTOGETHER THE ADVICE OF THE DERVISH HE TURNED TO FLY DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AND IN ONE MOMENT BECAME A BLACK STONE
HE COMMANDED THAT THE TALE OF THE HUNCHBACK SHOULD BE TOLD HIM IT IS CERTAINLY MOST SURPRISING CRIED HE WHEN HE HAD HEARD IT ALL BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THE BODY HE THEN KNELT DOWN AND TOOK THE HEAD ON HIS KNEES LOOKING AT IT ATTENTIVELY
THE TAILOR NOTICED MY CONFUSION AND WAS JUST GOING TO INQUIRE THE REASON WHEN THE DOOR OF THE ROOM OPENED AND THE OLD MAN APPEARED CARRYING WITH HIM MY HATCHET AND SHOES I AM A GENIUS HE SAID THE SON OF THE DAUGHTER OF EBLIS PRINCE OF THE GENII
FROM WHICH I HAD SUFFERED BEFORE AND AT LENGTH WE REACHED BAGDAD MY FIRST CARE WAS TO PRESENT MYSELF BEFORE THE CALIPH AND GIVE HIM AN ACCOUNT OF MY EMBASSY HE ASSURED ME THAT MY LONG ABSENCE HAD DISQUIETED HIM MUCH BUT HE HAD NEVERTHELESS HOPED FOR THE BEST
I FELL INTO THE HANDS OF A RICH MERCHANT WHO TOOK ME HOME WITH HIM AND CLOTHED AND FED ME WELL AND AFTER SOME DAYS SENT FOR ME AND QUESTIONED ME AS TO WHAT I COULD DO I ANSWERED THAT I WAS A RICH MERCHANT WHO HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY PIRATES AND THEREFORE I KNEW NO TRADE
AGAIN BOWING HUMBLY BEFORE HIM I CAN ASSURE YOUR MAJESTY THAT HE HAS IN NO WAY EXAGGERATED HIS WEALTH AND GRANDEUR NOTHING CAN EQUAL THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS PALACE WHEN HE GOES ABROAD HIS THRONE IS PREPARED UPON THE BACK OF AN ELEPHANT
AND SPEEDILY BUILT MYSELF A STOUT RAFT OF DRIFT WOOD WITH STRONG CORDS OF WHICH ENOUGH AND TO SPARE LAY STREWN UPON THE BEACH I THEN MADE UP MANY PACKAGES OF RUBIES EMERALDS ROCK CRYSTAL
I WAS TOO MUCH DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY TO DREAM OF REFUSING HER OFFER AND ACCORDINGLY THE PRINCESS HAD ME CONDUCTED TO THE BATH AND A RICH DRESS BEFITTING MY RANK WAS PROVIDED FOR ME THEN A FEAST OF THE MOST DELICATE DISHES WAS SERVED IN A ROOM HUNG WITH EMBROIDERED INDIAN FABRICS
THROWING HIMSELF ON ME LIKE A MADMAN HE TORE ME FROM MY HORSE BEAT ME TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND LEFT ME IN THE STATE YOUR MAJESTY SEES SO SAYING SAOUY TURNED ASIDE HIS HEAD AND WEPT BITTERLY
ASTOUNDED THAT HE SHOULD WISH TO PART FROM HER TOOK HER LUTE AND WITH TEARS IN HER EYES SANG HER REPROACHES TO ITS MUSIC
YOU SEEM TO FIND THAT A VERY GREAT SUM FOR YOU IT MAY BE SO BUT NOT FOR ME
AND I WILL RESERVE MY JUDGMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE SHOWN ME THE WHOLE THE PRINCESS THEN LED THE WAY FROM ROOM TO ROOM AND THE SULTAN EXAMINED EVERYTHING CAREFULLY
WHEN THE VESSEL HAD COME TO AN ANCHOR THEY PAID FIVE GOLD PIECES FOR THEIR PASSAGE AND WENT ASHORE NEVER HAVING BEEN IN BAGDAD BEFORE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO SEEK A LODGING
AND AFTER THEY WERE ALL REFRESHED THEY WENT INTO THE GARDEN WHERE THE SULTAN POINTED OUT TO HIS WIFE THE GOLDEN WATER AND THE SINGING TREE AS TO THE TALKING BIRD SHE HAD ALREADY MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM IN THE EVENING THEY RODE TOGETHER BACK TO THE CAPITAL
COUSIN WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE BE SO KIND AS TO CONDUCT THIS LADY TO A CERTAIN SPOT WHERE YOU WILL FIND A DOME LIKE TOMB NEWLY BUILT YOU CANNOT MISTAKE IT GO IN BOTH OF YOU AND WAIT TILL I COME I SHALL NOT BE LONG
MADAM THIS IS THE WAY THAT WILL LEAD YOU DOWN TO THE SPOT WHICH I TOLD YOU OF
THEY SKIRTED A GARDEN ENCLOSED BY A HIGH WALL THE GATE WAS SHUT BUT IN FRONT OF IT WAS AN OPEN VESTIBULE WITH A SOFA ON EITHER SIDE HERE SAID NOUREDDIN LET US PASS THE NIGHT AND RECLINING ON THE SOFAS THEY SOON FELL ASLEEP
ONE CANNOT EAT PEARLS SIRE REPLIED THE BIRD BEFORE EITHER THE PRINCES OR THE PRINCESS COULD SPEAK SURELY YOUR HIGHNESS CANNOT BE SO SURPRISED AT BEHOLDING A CUCUMBER STUFFED WITH PEARLS WHEN YOU BELIEVED WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY
IT DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR US TO ARRIVE AT THE SCENE OF THE PRINCE'S DISAPPEARANCE OR TO DISCOVER THE TOMB I HAD SOUGHT SO VAINLY BEFORE WE ENTERED IT AND FOUND THE TRAP DOOR WHICH LED TO THE STAIRCASE BUT WE HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN RAISING IT
BUT FOR THE KING HER PRICE HOWEVER IS TOO HIGH SIR REPLIED THE MERCHANT I SHOULD ESTEEM IT AN HONOUR TO PRESENT HER TO HIS MAJESTY DID IT BECOME A MERCHANT TO DO SUCH A THING
THEN I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF I IMPLORED THE GENIUS TO KEEP ME NO LONGER IN THIS STATE OF SUSPENSE
I TOOK MY LEAVE OF HIM WELL SATISFIED WITH THE HONOURS AND REWARDS HE BESTOWED UPON ME AND SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE RESTED FROM MY LABOURS AND GIVEN MYSELF UP WHOLLY TO MY FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS THUS SINDBAD ENDED THE STORY OF HIS SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE
IN A FEW DAYS I HAD QUITE RECOVERED FROM THE HARDSHIPS I HAD UNDERGONE AND THEN THE TAILOR KNOWING THAT IT WAS THE CUSTOM FOR THE PRINCES OF OUR RELIGION TO LEARN A TRADE OR PROFESSION SO AS TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES
AND YOU WILL BECOME ONE LIKEWISE IF YOU ARE NOT MORE CAREFUL IN FOLLOWING MY DIRECTIONS THEN HE CHARGED THE PRINCE AS HE VALUED HIS LIFE TO TAKE NO HEED OF THE CLAMOUR OF VOICES THAT WOULD PURSUE HIM UP THE MOUNTAIN
TELL ME SAID HE CAN YOU SHOOT WITH A BOW
THE OLD MAN FURIOUS AT THIS INSOLENCE AS HE CONSIDERED IT
MY BROTHER THANKED THEM FOR THEIR COURTESY AND ENTERED THE BUILDING WHICH WAS SO LARGE THAT IT TOOK HIM SOME TIME TO REACH THE APARTMENTS OF THE BARMECIDE AT LAST IN A ROOM RICHLY DECORATED WITH PAINTINGS
BEFORE BIDDING ADIEU TO THE FAIR PERSIAN HE SAID TO HER NO HAPPINESS CAN BE GREATER THAN WHAT I HAVE PROCURED FOR YOU JUDGE FOR YOURSELF YOU NOW BELONG TO THE KING
THE FORMULA IS ABSENT BESIDES HE HAS NOT SENT AN EXPRESS WITH THE PATENT WITHOUT WHICH THE LETTER IS USELESS LEAVE ALL TO ME AND I WILL TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES
SOME DAY YOU WILL PUT ME TO THE PROOF FOR I KNOW WHO YOU ARE BETTER THAN YOU DO YOURSELF MEANWHILE TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO AND I WILL OBEY YOU BIRD REPLIED THE PRINCESS WHO WAS
MY HEART SANK WHEN I PERCEIVED THAT THE COMMANDER
BUT IT PLACES ME IN A VERY AWKWARD POSITION IT IS ON MY ACCOUNT I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE RESISTED THE SULTAN'S WISHES AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR IT BUT KINGS DO NOT LIKE TO HAVE THEIR OFFERS REFUSED AND IN TIME HE WOULD BEAR A GRUDGE AGAINST YOU
WHO POSSESSES TWENTY THOUSAND DIAMOND CROWNS BEHOLD A MONARCH GREATER THAN SOLOMON AND MIHRAGE IN ALL THEIR GLORY THEN THE ONE WHO STANDS BEHIND THE THRONE ANSWERS
HOW SHOULD I WHEN I NEVER SAW HER BEFORE CUT HER HEAD OFF THEN IF SHE IS A STRANGER TO YOU AND I SHALL BELIEVE YOU ARE SPEAKING THE TRUTH AND WILL SET YOU AT LIBERTY
FIRST FROM A DISTANCE THEN HE DREW NEARER AND FINALLY PUT HIS HEAD IN AT THE DOOR NOUREDDIN SEEING HIM CALLED TO HIM TO COME IN AND KEEP THEM COMPANY AT FIRST THE OLD MAN DECLINED
FOR AN ORNAMENTAL VASE DUE TO THE PAINTER'S FANCY
FRED PAUSED AGAIN AN INSTANT AND THEN REPEATED AND I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO
WHILE ROSAMOND RESEATED HERSELF AND WATCHED HIM AS HE OPENED THE LETTER SHE HAD EXPECTED HIM TO BE SURPRISED WHILE LYDGATE'S EYES GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER THE BRIEF LETTER
WAS THE MORE CONSPICUOUS FROM ITS CONTRAST WITH GOOD MISTER BROOKE'S SCRAPPY SLOVENLINESS
FERMENTING STILL AS A DISTINGUISHABLE VIGOROUS ENTHUSIASM IN CERTAIN LONG HAIRED GERMAN ARTISTS AT ROME AND THE YOUTH OF OTHER NATIONS WHO WORKED OR IDLED NEAR THEM WERE SOMETIMES CAUGHT IN THE SPREADING MOVEMENT
WILL BE ASKING HER TO TELL ME WHETHER SHE RETURNS IT THAT IS WHAT I WANT HER TO TELL YOU SAID FRED BLUNTLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO UNLESS I CAN GET AT HER FEELING YOU MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BE GUIDED BY THAT AS TO YOUR GOING INTO THE CHURCH
GOOD SUPPOSE I GET ACQUAINTED WITH HER IN SPITE OF YOU
IN WHOSE CLEVERNESS HE DELIGHTED WHY NOT A MAN'S MIND WHAT THERE IS OF IT HAS ALWAYS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING MASCULINE
YES SUPPOSE SAID WILL LADISLAW IN A CONTEMPTUOUS UNDERTONE INTENDED TO DISMISS THE SUBJECT
BUT WHEN THE STATE OF A WOMAN'S AFFECTIONS TOUCHES THE HAPPINESS OF ANOTHER LIFE OF MORE LIVES THAN ONE I THINK IT WOULD BE THE NOBLER COURSE FOR HER TO BE PERFECTLY DIRECT AND OPEN MARY IN HER TURN WAS SILENT
IN THE VATICAN AND WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE MAGNIFICENT VIEW OF THE MOUNTAINS FROM THE ADJOINING ROUND VESTIBULE HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ABSORBED NOT TO NOTICE THE APPROACH OF A DARK EYED ANIMATED GERMAN WHO CAME UP TO HIM AND PLACING A HAND ON HIS SHOULDER
SHE HAD REFLECTED THAT DODO WOULD PERHAPS NOT MAKE A HUSBAND HAPPY WHO HAD NOT HER WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND STIFLED IN THE DEPTHS OF HER HEART WAS THE FEELING THAT HER SISTER WAS TOO RELIGIOUS FOR FAMILY COMFORT NOTIONS AND SCRUPLES WERE LIKE SPILT NEEDLES
AM I SUCH AN UNREASONABLE FURIOUS BRUTE WHY SHOULD YOU NOT BE OPEN WITH ME STILL SILENCE
BUT NOT TOO HARD I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN FAVOR OF A LITTLE THEORY WE MUST HAVE THOUGHT ELSE WE SHALL BE LANDED BACK IN THE DARK AGES BUT TALKING OF BOOKS THERE IS SOUTHEY'S PENINSULAR WAR
AND RESISTING ALL REPROACH IF HE HAD BEEN INDEPENDENT THIS MATTER OF A PATIENT'S TREATMENT AND THE DISTINCT RULE THAT HE MUST DO OR SEE DONE THAT WHICH HE BELIEVED BEST FOR THE LIFE COMMITTED TO HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN
BUT I CAN NEVER IMAGINE HIM PREACHING AND EXHORTING AND PRONOUNCING BLESSINGS AND PRAYING BY THE SICK WITHOUT FEELING AS IF I WERE LOOKING AT A CARICATURE
THEN I AM TO CONCLUDE THAT YOU DECLINE TO DO ANYTHING
IT'S MY OPINION THAT IF HE WERE TO PART FROM ME TO MORROW YOU'D ONLY HEAR THE MORE OF HIM IN THE COUNTRY WITH HIS TALENT FOR SPEAKING AND DRAWING UP DOCUMENTS THERE ARE FEW MEN WHO COULD COME UP TO HIM AS AN AGITATOR
MY GRATITUDE TO HIM FOR ALWAYS LOVING ME BEST AND
SAUNTERING DOWN THE HALL WITH A PREOCCUPIED AIR WHILE HIS GERMAN FRIEND KEPT AT HIS SIDE AND WATCHED HIM EAGERLY WHAT
MISTER CASAUBON HAD COME UP TO THE TABLE TEACUP IN HAND AND WAS LISTENING WE MUST NOT INQUIRE TOO CURIOUSLY INTO MOTIVES HE INTERPOSED IN HIS MEASURED WAY
AND DID NOT MIND HOW ANNOYING THEY WERE TO HER EVEN HER FATHER WAS UNKIND AND MIGHT HAVE DONE MORE FOR THEM IN FACT THERE WAS BUT ONE PERSON IN ROSAMOND'S WORLD WHOM SHE DID NOT REGARD AS BLAMEWORTHY AND THAT WAS THE GRACEFUL CREATURE WITH BLOND PLAITS
IT WOULD MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO THE BLESSED WORLD HERE I HAVE BEEN SET DOWN AS TAINTED AND SHOULD BE CHEAPENED TO THEM ALL THE SAME ALREADY THERE HAD BEEN ABUNDANT SIGNS WHICH HAD HITHERTO PUZZLED HIM THAT JUST WHEN HE HAD BEEN PAYING OFF HIS DEBTS
IT WOULD LOOK ALL THE WORSE FOR DOROTHEA TO THOSE WHO KNEW ABOUT IT IT WOULD SEEM AS IF WE DISTRUSTED HER DISTRUSTED HER YOU KNOW THAT MISTER BROOKE HAD HIT ON AN UNDENIABLE ARGUMENT DID NOT TEND TO SOOTHE SIR JAMES
HE ONLY CARESSED HER HE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING FOR WHAT WAS THERE TO SAY HE COULD NOT PROMISE TO SHIELD HER FROM THE DREADED WRETCHEDNESS FOR HE COULD SEE NO SURE MEANS OF DOING SO
IF HE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO GO DIDN'T CHOOSE YOU KNOW MISTER BROOKE PERSISTING AS QUIETLY AS IF HE WERE ONLY DISCUSSING THE NATURE OF LAST YEAR'S WEATHER AND NODDING AT THE END WITH HIS USUAL AMENITY
ONLY THOSE WHO KNOW THE SUPREMACY OF THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE THE LIFE WHICH HAS A SEED OF ENNOBLING THOUGHT AND PURPOSE WITHIN IT CAN UNDERSTAND THE GRIEF OF ONE WHO FALLS FROM THAT SERENE ACTIVITY INTO THE ABSORBING SOUL WASTING STRUGGLE
NO I WANT TO ASK A GREAT FAVOR OF YOU I AM ASHAMED TO BOTHER YOU IN THIS WAY BUT MARY MIGHT LISTEN TO WHAT YOU SAID IF YOU MENTIONED THE SUBJECT TO HER I MEAN ABOUT MY GOING INTO THE CHURCH THAT IS RATHER A DELICATE TASK MY DEAR FRED
IT ALL GOES FOR NOTHING SHE DOESN'T WANT TO MARRY LADISLAW BUT THIS CODICIL IS FRAMED SO AS TO MAKE EVERYBODY BELIEVE THAT SHE DID
THEN FROWNINGLY BUT I SUSPECT LADISLAW I TELL YOU FRANKLY I SUSPECT LADISLAW I COULDN'T TAKE ANY IMMEDIATE ACTION ON THAT GROUND CHETTAM
LADISLAW HAS BEEN INVALUABLE MOST SATISFACTORY I CONSIDER THAT I HAVE DONE THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY A SERVICE BY BRINGING HIM BY BRINGING HIM YOU KNOW MISTER BROOKE ENDED WITH A NOD TURNING ROUND TO GIVE IT
NO INDEED NOT EXACTLY
SHE SPOKE AND WEPT WITH THAT GENTLENESS WHICH MAKES SUCH WORDS AND TEARS OMNIPOTENT OVER A LOVING HEARTED MAN LYDGATE DREW HIS CHAIR NEAR TO HERS AND PRESSED HER DELICATE HEAD AGAINST HIS CHEEK WITH HIS POWERFUL TENDER HAND
MARY ANSWERED WITH A SLIGHT RESENTMENT IN HER MANNER I MEAN THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO PUT SUCH QUESTIONS UNTIL HE HAS DONE SOMETHING WORTHY INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT HE COULD DO IT MISTER FAREBROTHER WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR MORE
FOR GOING INTO THE CHURCH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR CONSCIENCE FRED
BUT I SAW IT WOULD NOT DO IT LEADS TO EVERYTHING YOU CAN LET NOTHING ALONE NO NO SEE THAT YOUR TENANTS DON'T SELL THEIR STRAW AND THAT KIND OF THING
DEAR TERTIUS DON'T SET YOUR WIFE TO WRITE TO ME WHEN YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ASK IT IS A ROUNDABOUT WHEEDLING SORT OF THING WHICH I SHOULD NOT HAVE CREDITED YOU WITH I NEVER CHOOSE TO WRITE TO A WOMAN ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS
SPOKE OF A HOUSE IN TOWN AND ASKED WHETHER MISS BROOKE DISLIKED LONDON AWAY FROM HER SISTER CELIA TALKED QUITE EASILY
THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE BEFORE MISTER FAREBROTHER LAID DOWN HIS WORK AND PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO FRED SAID VERY WELL MY BOY I WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH THAT VERY DAY MISTER FAREBROTHER WENT TO LOWICK PARSONAGE ON THE NAG WHICH HE HAD JUST SET UP
IT'S A PITY THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY DIDN'T DO WITHOUT HIM
THOUGH NOT AS SOME PEOPLE PRETENDED MORE CLEVER AND SENSIBLE THAN THE ELDER SISTER HE FELT THAT HE HAD CHOSEN THE ONE WHO WAS IN ALL RESPECTS THE SUPERIOR AND A MAN NATURALLY LIKES TO LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THE BEST
ONE OF US TWO MUST BOWEN DOUTELESS AND SITH A MAN IS MORE REASONABLE THAN WOMAN IS YE MEN MOSTE BE SUFFRABLE CHAUCER
AND LOOKED DOWN FOR SOME MOMENTS WITHOUT SPEAKING ROSAMOND HAD THE DOUBLE PURCHASE OVER HIM OF INSENSIBILITY TO THE POINT OF JUSTICE IN HIS REPROACH AND OF SENSIBILITY TO THE UNDENIABLE HARDSHIPS NOW PRESENT IN HER MARRIED LIFE
AND MUST KEEP THE CONSCIENCE ALIVE ALAS THE SCIENTIFIC CONSCIENCE HAD GOT INTO THE DEBASING COMPANY OF MONEY OBLIGATION AND SELFISH RESPECTS
EXCEPT INDEED IN A RELIGIOUS SORT OF WAY
THE TOWNSMEN WERE AVOIDING HIM OR LOOKING STRANGELY AT HIM AND IN TWO INSTANCES IT CAME TO HIS KNOWLEDGE THAT PATIENTS OF HIS HAD CALLED IN ANOTHER PRACTITIONER
LYDGATE FLUNG HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR FEELING CHECKMATED WHAT PLACE WAS THERE IN HER MIND FOR A REMONSTRANCE TO LODGE IN HE LAID DOWN HIS HAT FLUNG AN ARM OVER THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR
GOD BLESS YOU OH PLEASE STAY AND LET ME GIVE YOU SOME TEA SAID MARY HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS FOR SOMETHING INDEFINABLE SOMETHING LIKE THE RESOLUTE SUPPRESSION OF A PAIN IN MISTER FAREBROTHER'S MANNER MADE HER FEEL SUDDENLY MISERABLE
ANSWERED DOROTHEA REDDENING UNLIKE CELIA SHE RARELY BLUSHED AND ONLY FROM HIGH DELIGHT OR ANGER AT THIS MOMENT SHE FELT ANGRY WITH THE PERVERSE SIR JAMES WHY DID HE NOT PAY ATTENTION TO CELIA
IT MUST BE FRED VINCY HE HAS ASKED ME TO CONSULT YOU ABOUT HIS GOING INTO THE CHURCH I HOPE YOU WILL NOT THINK THAT I CONSENTED TO TAKE A LIBERTY IN PROMISING TO DO SO ON THE CONTRARY MISTER FAREBROTHER
EXCUSE ME I HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE PRACTICE AND I SHOULD BE EASILY THROWN THEN THAT IS A REASON FOR MORE PRACTICE EVERY LADY OUGHT TO BE A PERFECT HORSEWOMAN THAT SHE MAY ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND
HE WOULD HAVE THROWN UP THE CASE IN SPITE OF HIS RECENT HEAVY OBLIGATION BUT IF HE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY MONEY IF BULSTRODE HAD NEVER REVOKED HIS COLD RECOMMENDATION OF BANKRUPTCY
THE AROMA IS MIXED WITH THE GROSSER AIR WE MUST KEEP THE GERMINATING GRAIN AWAY FROM THE LIGHT DOROTHEA COLORED WITH PLEASURE AND LOOKED UP GRATEFULLY TO THE SPEAKER
IF YOU WILL ONLY MENTION THE TIME THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY GOOD I MEAN TO GIVE UP RIDING I SHALL NOT RIDE ANY MORE SAID DOROTHEA URGED TO THIS BRUSQUE RESOLUTION BY A LITTLE ANNOYANCE THAT SIR JAMES WOULD BE SOLICITING HER ATTENTION
YOU HAVE SPOKEN OF MY SECRET MEDDLING AND MY INTERFERING IGNORANCE AND MY FALSE ASSENT I HAVE NEVER EXPRESSED MYSELF IN THAT WAY TO YOU AND I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO APOLOGIZE YOU SPOKE OF ITS BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE WITH ME
SEATING HIMSELF AND STICKING ON HIS EYE GLASS AGAIN IT'S ALL OF A PIECE WITH CASAUBON'S ODDITY THIS PAPER NOW
WONDERING NOT AT MISTER FAREBROTHER'S MANNER BUT AT HIS TONE WHICH HAD A GRAVE RESTRAINED EMOTION IN IT WHEN THE STRANGE IDEA FLASHED ACROSS HER THAT HIS WORDS HAD REFERENCE TO HIMSELF SHE WAS INCREDULOUS AND ASHAMED OF ENTERTAINING IT
AS I MAY SAY WORDSWORTH WAS POET ONE AND DAVY WAS POET TWO THAT WAS TRUE IN EVERY SENSE YOU KNOW DOROTHEA FELT A LITTLE MORE UNEASY THAN USUAL
HE WAS GOING ON WITH AN OBSTINATE RESOLVE BUT HE WAS GETTING NEAR HOME AND THE THOUGHT OF ROSAMOND URGED ITSELF AGAIN INTO THAT CHIEF PLACE FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN THRUST BY THE AGONIZED STRUGGLES OF WOUNDED HONOR AND PRIDE
MISTER FAREBROTHER PAUSED A MOMENT AND LOOKED AT MARY HE MEANT TO GIVE FRED HIS FULL ADVANTAGE BUT IT WOULD BE WELL HE THOUGHT TO CLEAR HER MIND OF ANY SUPERSTITIONS SUCH AS WOMEN SOMETIMES FOLLOW WHEN THEY DO A MAN THE WRONG OF MARRYING HIM AS AN ACT OF ATONEMENT
AND SPOKE WITH COLD BRUSQUERIE VERY MUCH WITH THE AIR OF A HANDSOME BOY IN AMUSING CONTRAST WITH THE SOLICITOUS AMIABILITY OF HER ADMIRER I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR REASONS FOR THIS CRUEL RESOLUTION
A MAN CAN HARDLY ESCAPE BEING UNLOVING LYDGATE THOUGHT OF HIMSELF AS THE SUFFERER AND OF OTHERS AS THE AGENTS WHO HAD INJURED HIS LOT HE HAD MEANT EVERYTHING TO TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY
AS TO THE EXCESSIVE RELIGIOUSNESS ALLEGED AGAINST MISS BROOKE HE HAD A VERY INDEFINITE NOTION OF WHAT IT CONSISTED IN AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD DIE OUT WITH MARRIAGE IN SHORT
WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND STRAIGHTENED HIS BACK WITH A LITTLE SHAKE BEFORE HE REPLIED THAT IS EASILY SAID CHETTAM EASILY SAID YOU KNOW MY DEAR SIR PERSISTED SIR JAMES RESTRAINING HIS INDIGNATION WITHIN RESPECTFUL FORMS
TRAVELLERS DID NOT OFTEN CARRY FULL INFORMATION ON CHRISTIAN ART EITHER IN THEIR HEADS OR THEIR POCKETS AND EVEN THE MOST BRILLIANT ENGLISH CRITIC OF THE DAY MISTOOK THE FLOWER FLUSHED TOMB OF THE ASCENDED VIRGIN
LADISLAW DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF CASAUBON'S NOTIONS THOTH AND DAGON THAT SORT OF THING AND I FANCY THAT CASAUBON DIDN'T LIKE THE INDEPENDENT POSITION LADISLAW HAD TAKEN UP I SAW THE LETTERS BETWEEN THEM YOU KNOW
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD THINK HORSEMANSHIP WRONG IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD THINK IT WRONG FOR ME OH WHY SAID SIR JAMES IN A TENDER TONE OF REMONSTRANCE
IT WAS YOU WHO BROUGHT HIM HERE
THAT THE ASSOCIATION WITH THIS MAN HAD BEEN FATAL TO HIM TRUE THAT IF HE HAD HAD THE THOUSAND POUNDS STILL IN HIS HANDS WITH ALL HIS DEBTS UNPAID HE WOULD HAVE RETURNED THE MONEY TO BULSTRODE
I COULD NOT LOVE A MAN WHO IS RIDICULOUS SAID MARY NOT CHOOSING TO GO DEEPER FRED HAS SENSE AND KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM RESPECTABLE IF HE LIKES IN SOME GOOD WORLDLY BUSINESS
FRED'S VOICE HAD TAKEN A TONE OF GRUMBLING REMONSTRANCE AND MISTER FAREBROTHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO SMILE IF HIS MIND HAD NOT BEEN TOO BUSY IN IMAGINING MORE THAN FRED TOLD HIM HAVE YOU ANY DIFFICULTIES ABOUT DOCTRINES ABOUT THE ARTICLES
SHE WOULD MAKE US SO LIVELY AT LOWICK VERY FINE YOU TALK AS IF YOUNG WOMEN WERE TIED UP TO BE CHOSEN LIKE POULTRY AT MARKET AS IF I HAD ONLY TO ASK AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE ME SAID THE VICAR NOT CARING TO SPECIFY WE DON'T WANT EVERYBODY
I AM READING THAT OF A MORNING YOU KNOW SOUTHEY NO SAID MISTER CASAUBON NOT KEEPING PACE WITH MISTER BROOKE'S IMPETUOUS REASON AND THINKING OF THE BOOK ONLY
I SHOULD NEVER BE QUITE HAPPY IF I THOUGHT HE WAS UNHAPPY FOR THE LOSS OF ME
I MADE A GREAT STUDY OF THEOLOGY AT ONE TIME SAID MISTER BROOKE AS IF TO EXPLAIN THE INSIGHT JUST MANIFESTED I KNOW SOMETHING OF ALL SCHOOLS I KNEW WILBERFORCE IN HIS BEST DAYS
HOWEVER SINCE MISS BROOKE HAD BECOME ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER CASAUBON ABOUT THE VAUDOIS CLERGY SIR JAMES BETOOK HIMSELF TO CELIA
AND YET WHAT ELSE AM I TO DO MY FATHER CAN'T SPARE ME ANY CAPITAL ELSE I MIGHT GO INTO FARMING AND HE HAS NO ROOM FOR ME IN HIS TRADE AND OF COURSE I CAN'T BEGIN TO STUDY FOR LAW OR PHYSIC NOW WHEN MY FATHER WANTS ME TO EARN SOMETHING
WHAT WONDER THEN THAT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO OLD SIR GODWIN LYDGATE WAS SLOW TO WRITE A LETTER WHICH WAS OF CONSEQUENCE TO OTHERS RATHER THAN TO HIMSELF
YOU ADMIT I HOPE THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK ABOUT WHAT CONCERNS THE DIGNITY OF MY WIFE'S SISTER SIR JAMES WAS GETTING WARM OF COURSE MY DEAR CHETTAM OF COURSE BUT YOU AND I HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS DIFFERENT
WITH THE OUTSIDE OF THIS MOMENTOUS LETTER LYING ON THE TABLE BEFORE HER ABOUT TWELVE SHE HEARD HER HUSBAND'S STEP IN THE PASSAGE AND TRIPPING TO OPEN THE DOOR SHE SAID IN HER LIGHTEST TONES TERTIUS COME IN HERE HERE IS A LETTER FOR YOU
LYDGATE'S TENDERHEARTEDNESS WAS PRESENT JUST THEN ONLY AS A DREAD LEST HE SHOULD OFFEND AGAINST IT NOT AS AN EMOTION THAT SWAYED HIM TO TENDERNESS FOR HE WAS VERY MISERABLE
AH HE SAID NOT TAKING OFF HIS HAT BUT JUST TURNING HER ROUND WITHIN HIS ARM TO WALK TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE THE LETTER LAY
WELL NO NOT THE URGENCY OF THE THING BY AND BY PERHAPS IT MAY COME ROUND AS TO GOSSIP YOU KNOW SENDING HIM AWAY WON'T HINDER GOSSIP PEOPLE SAY WHAT THEY LIKE TO SAY NOT WHAT THEY HAVE CHAPTER AND VERSE FOR
BUT HER VOICE IS MUCH DIVINER THAN ANYTHING YOU HAVE SEEN OF HER I SEE I SEE YOU ARE JEALOUS NO MAN MUST PRESUME TO THINK THAT HE CAN PAINT YOUR IDEAL THIS IS SERIOUS MY FRIEND
UNMITIGATED CALAMITY AND HE WAS AFRAID OF GOING TO ROSAMOND BEFORE HE HAD VENTED HIMSELF IN THIS SOLITARY RAGE LEST THE MERE SIGHT OF HER SHOULD EXASPERATE HIM AND MAKE HIM BEHAVE UNWARRANTABLY
YET I FELT THAT I OUGHT NOT TO LET IT BE USED BY SOME ONE ELSE INSTEAD OF ME IT IS I WHO AM BOUND TO ACT SO THAT YOU WILL NOT REGRET YOUR POWER SAID MISTER FAREBROTHER HIS WAS ONE OF THE NATURES IN WHICH CONSCIENCE GETS THE MORE ACTIVE WHEN THE YOKE OF LIFE CEASES TO GALL THEM
BUT THAT HE TRUSTED SOON TO SEE HIM BETTER AND WOULD CALL AGAIN THE NEXT DAY UNLESS SHE SENT FOR HIM EARLIER HE WENT DIRECTLY HOME
SAID THE GOOD NATURED PAINTER
I THINK IT WOULD BE RATHER RIDICULOUS IN ME TO URGE SCRUPLES OF THAT SORT AS IF I WERE A JUDGE SAID FRED QUITE SIMPLY
I DINED WITH HIM YEARS AGO AT CARTWRIGHT'S AND WORDSWORTH WAS THERE TOO THE POET WORDSWORTH YOU KNOW NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SINGULAR
ABOUT THIS OR THAT WHO COULD HELP HER HUSBAND OUT WITH REASONS
BUT NOT WITH YOUNG GENTLEMEN OH WITH SOME I SUPPOSE SINCE SOME OF THEM TURN INTO EXCELLENT MEN
WHEREAS THE REMARK LAY IN HIS MIND AS LIGHTLY AS THE BROKEN WING OF AN INSECT AMONG ALL THE OTHER FRAGMENTS THERE AND A CHANCE CURRENT HAD SENT IT ALIGHTING ON HER WHEN THE TWO GIRLS WERE IN THE DRAWING ROOM ALONE CELIA SAID
PERHAPS THERE MIGHT BE A PARTICULAR NOTE TO HER ENCLOSED BUT LYDGATE WAS NATURALLY ADDRESSED ON THE QUESTION OF MONEY
THE GENERAL BLACK BALLING HAD BEGUN NO WONDER THAT IN LYDGATE'S ENERGETIC NATURE THE SENSE OF A HOPELESS MISCONSTRUCTION EASILY TURNED INTO A DOGGED RESISTANCE
BUT IN HIS HEART HE FELT RATHER ASHAMED THAT HIS CONDUCT HAD SHOWN LACHES WHICH OTHERS WHO DID NOT GET BENEFICES WERE FREE FROM I USED OFTEN TO WISH I HAD BEEN SOMETHING ELSE THAN A CLERGYMAN HE SAID TO LYDGATE
SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT THAT ANY MAN COULD LOVE HER EXCEPT FRED WHO HAD ESPOUSED HER WITH THE UMBRELLA RING WHEN SHE WORE SOCKS AND LITTLE STRAPPED SHOES STILL LESS THAT SHE COULD BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE TO MISTER FAREBROTHER THE CLEVEREST MAN IN HER NARROW CIRCLE
SIT DOWN FRED I'M READY TO HEAR AND DO ANYTHING I CAN SAID THE VICAR WHO WAS BUSY PACKING SOME SMALL OBJECTS FOR REMOVAL AND WENT ON WITH HIS WORK I WANTED TO TELL YOU
BUT IF HE BRAVED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES OF GETTING HIS BREAD IN SOME OTHER WAY WILL YOU GIVE HIM THE SUPPORT OF HOPE MAY HE COUNT ON WINNING YOU I THINK FRED OUGHT NOT TO NEED TELLING AGAIN WHAT I HAVE ALREADY SAID TO HIM
HE WAS MADE OF EXCELLENT HUMAN DOUGH AND HAD THE RARE MERIT OF KNOWING THAT HIS TALENTS EVEN IF LET LOOSE WOULD NOT SET THE SMALLEST STREAM IN THE COUNTY ON FIRE HENCE HE LIKED THE PROSPECT OF A WIFE TO WHOM HE COULD SAY WHAT SHALL WE DO
THERE SHE GOES LET US FOLLOW HER HOME NO NO SAID HIS COMPANION WITH A LITTLE FROWN YOU ARE SINGULAR LADISLAW YOU LOOK STRUCK TOGETHER DO YOU KNOW HER I
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND RELIANCE OF HER FAMILY A POSITIVE INSULT TO DOROTHEA WELL YOU KNOW CASAUBON WAS A LITTLE TWISTED ABOUT LADISLAW LADISLAW HAS TOLD ME THE REASON DISLIKE OF THE BENT HE TOOK YOU KNOW
BUT REALLY LIFE COULD NEVER HAVE GONE ON AT ANY PERIOD BUT FOR THIS LIBERAL ALLOWANCE OF CONCLUSIONS WHICH HAS FACILITATED MARRIAGE UNDER THE DIFFICULTIES OF CIVILIZATION HAS ANY ONE EVER PINCHED
HE WAS SETTING HIS MIND ON REMAINING IN MIDDLEMARCH IN SPITE OF THE WORST THAT COULD BE DONE AGAINST HIM HE WOULD NOT RETREAT BEFORE CALUMNY AS IF HE SUBMITTED TO IT HE WOULD FACE IT TO THE UTMOST AND NO ACT OF HIS
MARY WAS SAYING IN A GRAVE CONTRALTO
AND I THINK THERE IS NOTHING MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN SUCH IMBECILE GENTILITY
ONE FINE MORNING A YOUNG MAN WHOSE HAIR WAS NOT IMMODERATELY LONG BUT ABUNDANT AND CURLY AND WHO WAS OTHERWISE ENGLISH IN HIS EQUIPMENT HAD JUST TURNED HIS BACK ON THE BELVEDERE TORSO
THAT NEVER EXPLAINED SCIENCE WHICH WAS THRUST AS AN EXTINGUISHER OVER ALL HER LIGHTS BUT YOU ARE FOND OF RIDING MISS BROOKE SIR JAMES PRESENTLY TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD ENTER A LITTLE INTO THE PLEASURES OF HUNTING
OFFER HIS OWN TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF HIMSELF AND SAY I DID NOT TAKE THE MONEY AS A BRIBE
WILL YOU ONLY SAY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN AND THAT I MAY DEPEND ON YOUR NOT ACTING SECRETLY IN FUTURE SAID LYDGATE URGENTLY BUT WITH SOMETHING OF REQUEST IN HIS TONE WHICH ROSAMOND WAS QUICK TO PERCEIVE SHE SPOKE WITH COOLNESS
DO YOU KNOW WILBERFORCE MISTER CASAUBON SAID NO WELL WILBERFORCE WAS PERHAPS NOT ENOUGH OF A THINKER BUT IF I WENT INTO PARLIAMENT
AND ROSAMOND AWAITING AN ANSWER TO HER WINNING APPEAL WAS EVERY DAY DISAPPOINTED LYDGATE IN TOTAL IGNORANCE OF HER EXPECTATIONS WAS SEEING THE BILLS COME IN AND FEELING THAT DOVER'S USE OF HIS ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER CREDITORS WAS IMMINENT
SAID SIR JAMES BUT I BELIEVE CASAUBON WAS ONLY JEALOUS OF HIM ON DOROTHEA'S ACCOUNT AND THE WORLD WILL SUPPOSE THAT SHE GAVE HIM SOME REASON AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO ABOMINABLE COUPLING HER NAME WITH THIS YOUNG FELLOW'S
THE SCOWL WHICH OCCASIONALLY SHOWED ITSELF ON HIS SQUARE BROW WAS NOT A MEANINGLESS ACCIDENT ALREADY WHEN HE WAS RE ENTERING THE TOWN AFTER THAT RIDE TAKEN IN THE FIRST HOURS OF STINGING PAIN
HE FELT HIMSELF BECOMING VIOLENT AND UNREASONABLE AS IF RAGING UNDER THE PAIN OF STINGS HE WAS READY TO CURSE THE DAY ON WHICH HE HAD COME TO MIDDLEMARCH
AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE BLOOMING ENGLISHMAN OF THE RED WHISKERED TYPE REPRESENTED BY SIR JAMES CHETTAM I AM READING THE AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY SAID THIS EXCELLENT BARONET
HALO TO HER FACE AROUND THE SIMPLY BRAIDED DARK BROWN HAIR SHE WAS NOT LOOKING AT THE SCULPTURE PROBABLY NOT THINKING OF IT HER LARGE EYES WERE FIXED DREAMILY ON A STREAK OF SUNLIGHT WHICH FELL ACROSS THE FLOOR
FRED HESITATED AN INSTANT AND THEN WENT ON PLUNGINGLY I MIGHT GO INTO THE CHURCH NOW AND REALLY LOOK WHERE I MAY I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO
GREAT MISTAKE CHETTAM INTERPOSED MISTER BROOKE GOING INTO ELECTRIFYING YOUR LAND AND THAT KIND OF THING AND MAKING A PARLOR OF YOUR COW HOUSE IT WON'T DO I WENT INTO SCIENCE A GREAT DEAL MYSELF AT ONE TIME
HOWEVER WISDOM LIES MORE IN THOSE TWO QUALITIES THAN PEOPLE ARE APT TO IMAGINE I HOPE YOU KNOW BY THOSE MARKS WHAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN I MEAN YES I THINK I DO SAID MARY BRAVELY HER FACE GETTING MORE SERIOUS AND HER HANDS COLD
BUT DUTY HAS A TRICK OF BEHAVING UNEXPECTEDLY SOMETHING LIKE A HEAVY FRIEND WHOM WE HAVE AMIABLY ASKED TO VISIT US AND WHO BREAKS HIS LEG WITHIN OUR GATES HARDLY A WEEK LATER DUTY PRESENTED ITSELF IN HIS STUDY UNDER THE DISGUISE OF FRED VINCY
HE HAS WORKED HIS WAY SO FAR AND NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS HE TO DO
IT IS ONLY THAT I HAVE MY GIRLISH MOCKING WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS SAID MARY WITH A RETURNING SPARKLE OF PLAYFULNESS IN HER ANSWER WHICH ONLY MADE ITS MODESTY MORE CHARMING HE WISHES ME TO REPORT EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK SAID MISTER FAREBROTHER
HE DELIVERED HIMSELF WITH PRECISION AS IF HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND THE BALANCED SING SONG NEATNESS OF HIS SPEECH OCCASIONALLY CORRESPONDED TO BY A MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD
AS AN EXECUTRIX DOROTHEA WOULD WANT TO ACT AND SHE WAS TWENTY ONE LAST DECEMBER YOU KNOW I CAN HINDER NOTHING SIR JAMES LOOKED AT THE CARPET FOR A MINUTE IN SILENCE AND THEN LIFTING HIS EYES SUDDENLY
BUT YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I CAN CONSULT
HE LOOKS MORE LIKE AN UNCLE A MORE USEFUL SORT OF RELATION HE IS NOT MY UNCLE I TELL YOU HE IS MY SECOND COUSIN SAID LADISLAW WITH SOME IRRITATION
BUT UNDER THAT QUIETUDE WAS HIDDEN AN INTENSE EFFECT SHE WAS IN SUCH ENTIRE DISGUST WITH HER HUSBAND THAT SHE WISHED SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SIR GODWIN'S RUDENESS TOWARDS HER AND UTTER WANT OF FEELING RANGED HIM WITH DOVER AND ALL OTHER CREDITORS
HAD LOCKE THOSE TWO WHITE MOLES WITH HAIRS ON THEM OH I DARE SAY WHEN PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN SORT LOOKED AT HIM SAID DOROTHEA WALKING AWAY A LITTLE
CERTAINLY IF RAFFLES HAD CONTINUED ALIVE AND SUSCEPTIBLE OF FURTHER TREATMENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND HE HAD THEN IMAGINED ANY DISOBEDIENCE TO HIS ORDERS ON THE PART OF BULSTRODE HE WOULD HAVE MADE A STRICT INQUIRY AND IF HIS
YOUNG LADIES DON'T UNDERSTAND POLITICAL ECONOMY YOU KNOW SAID MISTER BROOKE SMILING TOWARDS MISTER CASAUBON I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE ALL READING ADAM SMITH THERE IS A BOOK NOW
SAID SIR JAMES HIS IRRITATION MAKING HIM FORGET HIMSELF A LITTLE I AM SURE CASAUBON WAS NOT
IS NOTHING BUT A MAN ON A GRAY ASS LIKE MY OWN WHO CARRIES SOMETHING SHINY ON HIS HEAD JUST SO ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE AND THAT RESPLENDENT OBJECT IS THE HELMET OF MAMBRINO
WHAT A WORK TO BE IN ANY WAY PRESENT AT TO ASSIST IN THOUGH ONLY AS A LAMP HOLDER THIS ELEVATING THOUGHT LIFTED HER ABOVE HER ANNOYANCE AT BEING TWITTED WITH HER IGNORANCE OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
THEY WERE NOT MARRIED THEN I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE COMING TO ROME BUT YOU WILL GO TO SEE THEM NOW YOU WILL FIND OUT WHAT THEY HAVE FOR AN ADDRESS SINCE YOU KNOW THE NAME SHALL WE GO TO THE POST AND YOU COULD SPEAK ABOUT THE PORTRAIT
QUAKERISH GRAY DRAPERY HER LONG CLOAK FASTENED AT THE NECK WAS THROWN BACKWARD FROM HER ARMS AND ONE BEAUTIFUL UNGLOVED HAND PILLOWED HER CHEEK PUSHING SOMEWHAT BACKWARD THE WHITE BEAVER BONNET
NOT A SILLY ONE I HOPE SAID MARY BEGINNING TO PLUCK THE ROSES AGAIN AND FEELING HER HEART BEAT UNCOMFORTABLY NO THOUGH PERHAPS WISDOM IS NOT HIS STRONG POINT BUT RATHER AFFECTION AND SINCERITY
ANY MORE THAN THE MATERIALS OF OUR GROCERY AND CLOTHES ROSAMOND FELT THAT SHE WAS AGGRIEVED AND THAT THIS WAS WHAT LYDGATE HAD TO RECOGNIZE AS FOR HIM THE NEED OF ACCOMMODATING HIMSELF TO HER NATURE WHICH WAS INFLEXIBLE IN PROPORTION TO ITS NEGATIONS
THOROUGHLY CLEAR TO HIM BULSTRODE HAD BEEN IN DREAD OF SCANDALOUS DISCLOSURES ON THE PART OF RAFFLES LYDGATE COULD NOW CONSTRUCT ALL THE PROBABILITIES OF THE CASE HE WAS AFRAID OF SOME BETRAYAL IN MY HEARING
HE FELT HIMSELF TO BE IN LOVE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND WAS READY TO ENDURE A GREAT DEAL OF PREDOMINANCE WHICH AFTER ALL A MAN COULD ALWAYS PUT DOWN WHEN HE LIKED
WHO WAS MAKING TENDER LITTLE BEAVER LIKE NOISES THERE SHALL BE SUGAR CANDY ALWAYS ON THE TABLE FOR YOU TO STEAL AND GIVE TO THE CHILDREN AND YOU SHALL HAVE A GREAT MANY NEW STOCKINGS TO MAKE PRESENTS OF AND YOU SHALL DARN YOUR OWN MORE THAN EVER
HERE WAS A MAN WHO COULD UNDERSTAND THE HIGHER INWARD LIFE AND WITH WHOM THERE COULD BE SOME SPIRITUAL COMMUNION NAY
HIS MANNERS SHE THOUGHT WERE VERY DIGNIFIED THE SET OF HIS IRON GRAY HAIR AND HIS DEEP EYE SOCKETS MADE HIM RESEMBLE THE PORTRAIT OF LOCKE HE HAD THE SPARE FORM AND THE PALE COMPLEXION WHICH BECAME A STUDENT
YES FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T PAINT SAID NAUMANN THERE YOU HAVE PERFECT RIGHT I DID NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO PAINT MY FRIEND THE AMIABLE ARTIST CARRIED HIS STING BUT LADISLAW DID NOT CHOOSE TO APPEAR STUNG
BUT PERHAPS IT WILL BE BETTER TO TRY AND MAKE AS GOOD A CLERGYMAN OUT OF MYSELF AS I CAN THAT IS THE WELL BENEFICED POINT OF VIEW YOU PERCEIVE FROM WHICH DIFFICULTIES ARE MUCH SIMPLIFIED HE ENDED SMILING THE VICAR DID FEEL THEN AS IF HIS SHARE OF DUTIES WOULD BE EASY
WHEN ROSAMOND HAD FINISHED READING THE LETTER SHE SAT QUITE STILL WITH HER HANDS FOLDED BEFORE HER RESTRAINING ANY SHOW OF HER KEEN DISAPPOINTMENT AND INTRENCHING HERSELF IN QUIET PASSIVITY UNDER HER HUSBAND'S WRATH
EXACTLY SAID SIR JAMES
AN AGITATOR YOU KNOW AGITATOR SAID SIR JAMES WITH BITTER EMPHASIS FEELING THAT THE SYLLABLES OF THIS WORD
HE SAID TRYING HARD TO THINK OF THE QUESTION SIMPLY FOR FRED'S SAKE NO I SUPPOSE THE ARTICLES ARE RIGHT I AM NOT PREPARED WITH ANY ARGUMENTS TO DISPROVE THEM AND MUCH BETTER CLEVERER FELLOWS THAN I AM GO IN FOR THEM ENTIRELY
WHEN HE LEFT HER TO GO OUT AGAIN HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT WAS TEN TIMES HARDER FOR HER THAN FOR HIM HE HAD A LIFE AWAY FROM HOME AND CONSTANT APPEALS TO HIS ACTIVITY ON BEHALF OF OTHERS HE WISHED TO EXCUSE EVERYTHING IN HER IF HE COULD
SHE TOOK HIS FORE PAWS IN ONE HAND AND LIFTED UP THE FOREFINGER OF THE OTHER WHILE THE DOG WRINKLED HIS BROWS AND LOOKED EMBARRASSED
DOROTHEA QUITE DESPISES SIR JAMES CHETTAM I BELIEVE SHE WOULD NOT ACCEPT HIM CELIA FELT THAT THIS WAS A PITY SHE HAD NEVER BEEN DECEIVED AS TO THE OBJECT OF THE BARONET'S INTEREST SOMETIMES INDEED
I DON'T KNOW THAT SAID SIR JAMES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS INDELICATE ONE OF POOR CASAUBON'S FREAKS THAT ATTACK UPSET HIS BRAIN A LITTLE
BY THE WAY IT WAS THAT VERY EVENING ON WHICH I ONCE BEFORE FULFILLED A MISSION FROM FRED JUST AFTER HE HAD GONE TO COLLEGE MISTER GARTH TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT OF FEATHERSTONE'S DEATH HOW YOU REFUSED TO BURN THE WILL AND HE SAID THAT YOU HAD SOME HEART PRICKINGS ON THAT SUBJECT
SHE DID NOT OBSERVE MISTER FAREBROTHER'S APPROACH ALONG THE GRASS AND HAD JUST STOOPED DOWN TO LECTURE A SMALL BLACK AND TAN TERRIER WHICH WOULD PERSIST IN WALKING ON THE SHEET AND SMELLING AT THE ROSE LEAVES AS MARY SPRINKLED THEM
AND EVEN HIS IGNORANCE IS OF A SOUNDER QUALITY SIR JAMES MIGHT NOT HAVE ORIGINATED THIS ESTIMATE BUT A KIND PROVIDENCE FURNISHES THE LIMPEST PERSONALITY WITH A LITTLE GUM OR STARCH IN THE FORM OF TRADITION
BECAUSE I AM GOING TO TAKE ONE OF THE FARMS INTO MY OWN HANDS AND SEE IF SOMETHING CANNOT BE DONE IN SETTING A GOOD PATTERN OF FARMING AMONG MY TENANTS DO YOU APPROVE OF THAT MISS BROOKE A
HAS MISTER CASAUBON A GREAT SOUL CELIA WAS NOT WITHOUT A TOUCH OF NAIVE MALICE YES I BELIEVE HE HAS SAID DOROTHEA WITH THE FULL VOICE OF DECISION
TAKING ON A DRY WHITENESS WITH NOSTRILS AND LIPS QUIVERING HE TOSSED DOWN THE LETTER BEFORE HER AND SAID VIOLENTLY IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ENDURE LIFE WITH YOU IF YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ACTING SECRETLY ACTING IN OPPOSITION TO ME AND HIDING YOUR ACTIONS
I SAW HER WEDDING RING ON THAT WONDERFUL LEFT HAND
CONFOUND YOU NAUMANN I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHALL DO I AM NOT SO BRAZEN AS YOU BAH
THEN I HAVE FULFILLED MY COMMISSION THOROUGHLY SAID MISTER FAREBROTHER PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO MARY AND I SHALL RIDE BACK TO MIDDLEMARCH FORTHWITH WITH THIS PROSPECT BEFORE HIM WE SHALL GET FRED INTO THE RIGHT NICHE SOMEHOW AND I HOPE I SHALL LIVE TO JOIN YOUR HANDS
EITHER HE MAY COUNT ON YOUR REMAINING SINGLE UNTIL HE SHALL HAVE EARNED YOUR HAND OR HE MAY IN ANY CASE BE DISAPPOINTED PARDON ME MARY
SAID MISTER BROOKE BECOMING ACUTE ABOUT THE TRUTHS THAT LAY ON THE SIDE OF HIS OWN WISHES I MIGHT GET RID OF LADISLAW UP TO A CERTAIN POINT TAKE AWAY THE PIONEER FROM HIM AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT I COULDN'T SEND HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY
NO NONSENSE NAUMANN ENGLISH LADIES ARE NOT AT EVERYBODY'S SERVICE AS MODELS AND YOU WANT TO EXPRESS TOO MUCH WITH YOUR PAINTING YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE MADE A BETTER OR WORSE PORTRAIT WITH A BACKGROUND
UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT BUT HE WAS REALLY EXPECTING TO SET OFF SOON
WITH WORLDLY ANNOYANCES HOW WAS HE TO LIVE ON WITHOUT VINDICATING HIMSELF AMONG PEOPLE WHO SUSPECTED HIM OF BASENESS
AND MANNERS MUST BE VERY MARKED INDEED BEFORE THEY CEASE TO BE INTERPRETED BY PRECONCEPTIONS EITHER CONFIDENT OR DISTRUSTFUL SHE WAS THOROUGHLY CHARMING TO HIM BUT OF COURSE HE THEORIZED A LITTLE ABOUT HIS ATTACHMENT
I TOOK IN ALL THE NEW IDEAS AT ONE TIME HUMAN PERFECTIBILITY NOW BUT SOME SAY HISTORY MOVES IN CIRCLES AND THAT MAY BE VERY WELL ARGUED I HAVE ARGUED IT MYSELF
I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME SEND OVER A CHESTNUT HORSE FOR YOU TO TRY IT HAS BEEN TRAINED FOR A LADY I SAW YOU ON SATURDAY CANTERING OVER THE HILL ON A NAG NOT WORTHY OF YOU MY GROOM SHALL BRING CORYDON FOR YOU EVERY DAY
YOU MUST WAIT FOR MOVEMENT AND TONE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR VERY BREATHING THEY CHANGE FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT THIS WOMAN WHOM YOU HAVE JUST SEEN FOR EXAMPLE HOW WOULD YOU PAINT HER VOICE PRAY
IF THAT LEARNED MAN WOULD ONLY TALK INSTEAD OF ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE TALKED TO BY MISTER BROOKE WHO WAS JUST THEN INFORMING HIM THAT THE REFORMATION EITHER MEANT SOMETHING OR IT DID NOT THAT HE HIMSELF WAS A PROTESTANT TO THE CORE
HE WENT ON AS IF HE HAD NOT HEARD LANGUAGE GIVES A FULLER IMAGE WHICH IS ALL THE BETTER FOR BEINGS VAGUE AFTER ALL THE TRUE SEEING IS WITHIN AND PAINTING STARES AT YOU WITH AN INSISTENT IMPERFECTION I FEEL THAT ESPECIALLY ABOUT
IF HE MET SHRUGS COLD GLANCES AND AVOIDANCE AS AN ACCUSATION AND MADE A PUBLIC STATEMENT OF ALL THE FACTS AS HE KNEW THEM WHO WOULD BE CONVINCED IT WOULD BE PLAYING THE PART OF A FOOL TO
BUT WHETHER HE DID OR NOT THE WORLD BELIEVES THAT HE SOMEHOW OR OTHER POISONED THE MAN AND THAT I WINKED AT THE CRIME IF I DIDN'T HELP IN IT AND YET AND YET HE MAY NOT BE GUILTY OF THE LAST OFFENCE AND IT IS
IT IS NOT A SIN TO MAKE YOURSELF POOR IN PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS FOR THE GOOD OF ALL SHE SPOKE WITH MORE ENERGY THAN IS EXPECTED OF SO YOUNG A LADY BUT SIR JAMES HAD APPEALED TO HER HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO SO
AS IF IT WERE AN INSTITUTION FOR GETTING UP IDIOTS GENTEELLY AS IF MARY CHECKED HERSELF
AND AMATEURISH IF YOU WERE AN ARTIST YOU WOULD THINK OF MISTRESS SECOND COUSIN AS ANTIQUE FORM ANIMATED BY CHRISTIAN SENTIMENT
JUST POSSIBLE THAT THE CHANGE TOWARDS ME MAY HAVE BEEN A GENUINE RELENTING THE EFFECT OF SECOND THOUGHTS SUCH AS HE ALLEGED
THERE ARE EPISODES IN MOST MEN'S LIVES IN WHICH THEIR HIGHEST QUALITIES CAN ONLY CAST A DETERRING SHADOW OVER THE OBJECTS THAT FILL THEIR INWARD VISION
WHEN WORDSWORTH WAS THERE AND I NEVER MET HIM AND I DINED WITH HIM TWENTY YEARS AFTERWARDS AT CARTWRIGHT'S THERE'S AN ODDITY IN THINGS NOW BUT DAVY WAS THERE HE WAS A POET TOO OR
I HAD NEARLY RESOLVED ON GOING TO QUALLINGHAM IT WOULD HAVE COST ME PAIN ENOUGH TO DO IT YET IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OF SOME USE BUT IT HAS BEEN OF NO USE FOR ME TO THINK OF ANYTHING YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COUNTERACTING ME SECRETLY YOU DELUDE ME WITH A FALSE ASSENT
SAID THE VICAR RISING PUSHING HIS CHAIR AWAY AND LOOKING DOWN AT HIMSELF WHAT DO YOU SAY MOTHER YOU ARE A HANDSOME MAN CAMDEN THOUGH NOT SO FINE A FIGURE OF A MAN AS YOUR FATHER SAID THE OLD LADY I WISH YOU WOULD MARRY MISS GARTH BROTHER SAID MISS WINIFRED
BUT I THINK HE WOULD NOT SHOW IT AS A CLERGYMAN HE WOULD BE A PIECE OF PROFESSIONAL AFFECTATION THEN THE ANSWER IS QUITE DECIDED AS A CLERGYMAN HE COULD HAVE NO HOPE MARY SHOOK HER HEAD
LADISLAW IS A GENTLEMAN
NOT EXCEPTING EVEN MONSIEUR LIRET THE VAUDOIS CLERGYMAN WHO HAD GIVEN CONFERENCES ON THE HISTORY OF THE WALDENSES TO RECONSTRUCT A PAST WORLD DOUBTLESS WITH A VIEW TO THE HIGHEST PURPOSES OF TRUTH
BY MODERATING HIS WORDS CAN YOU NOT SEE ROSAMOND HE BEGAN AGAIN TRYING TO BE SIMPLY GRAVE AND NOT BITTER THAT NOTHING CAN BE SO FATAL AS A WANT OF OPENNESS AND CONFIDENCE BETWEEN US IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN
MISTER PHILLOTSON HAVING BEEN ABSENT ALL THE AFTERNOON AT A TEACHERS MEETING AT SHOTTSFORD JUDE WENT INTO THE EMPTY SCHOOLROOM AND SAT DOWN THE GIRL WHO WAS SWEEPING THE FLOOR HAVING INFORMED HIM THAT MISSUS PHILLOTSON WOULD BE BACK AGAIN IN A FEW MINUTES
IS IT ALL YOU EXPECTED OF IT YES MORE CRIED JUDE WHEN I WAS THERE ONCE FOR AN HOUR I DIDN'T SEE MUCH IN IT FOR MY PART AULD CRUMBLING BUILDINGS HALF CHURCH HALF ALMSHOUSE AND NOT MUCH GOING ON AT THAT
AN AGED HORSE WITH A HANGING HEAD HAD BEEN PURCHASED FOR EIGHT POUNDS AT A SALE A CREAKING CART WITH A WHITY BROWN TILT OBTAINED FOR A FEW POUNDS MORE AND IN THIS TURN OUT IT BECAME JUDE'S BUSINESS THRICE A WEEK TO CARRY LOAVES OF BREAD TO THE VILLAGERS
SHE DOES NOT REALIZE WHAT MARRIAGE MEANS HE PASSIVELY ACQUIESCED IN HER WISH TO GO IN AND THEY ENTERED BY THE WESTERN DOOR THE ONLY PERSON INSIDE THE GLOOMY BUILDING WAS A CHARWOMAN CLEANING
AND WOULD NOT DISCOVER TILL AMID THE STORMS AND STRAINS OF AFTER YEARS WITH THEIR INJUSTICE LONELINESS CHILD BEARING AND BEREAVEMENT THEIR MINDS WOULD REVERT TO THIS EXPERIENCE AS TO SOMETHING WHICH HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO SLIP PAST THEM INSUFFICIENTLY REGARDED
I DIDN'T THROW IT I TELL YOU ASSERTED ONE GIRL TO HER NEIGHBOUR AS IF UNCONSCIOUS OF THE YOUNG MAN'S PRESENCE NOR I THE SECOND ANSWERED OH ANNY HOW CAN YOU SAID THE THIRD
SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD JUDE STAGGERED UNDER THE NEWS COULD EAT NO BREAKFAST AND KEPT ON DRINKING TEA BECAUSE HIS MOUTH WAS SO DRY
WHO HAD DRAWN HIM TO HER WHICH MADE IT NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD ASSERT MERE SPORTIVENESS ON HIS PART AS HIS REASON IN SEEKING HER SOMETHING IN HER QUITE ANTIPATHETIC TO THAT SIDE OF HIM WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED WITH LITERARY STUDY AND THE MAGNIFICENT CHRISTMINSTER DREAM
TILL MOVED BY AMATORY CURIOSITY SHE TURNED HER EYES CRITICALLY UPON HIM YOU DON'T THINK I WOULD SHY THINGS AT YOU OH NO
THERE CAME PROMPTLY A NOTE WHICH SHE MUST HAVE WRITTEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HE HAD GONE FROM HER FORGIVE ME FOR MY PETULANCE YESTERDAY I WAS HORRID TO YOU I KNOW IT AND I FEEL PERFECTLY MISERABLE AT MY HORRIDNESS IT WAS SO DEAR OF YOU NOT TO BE ANGRY JUDE
THEN JUDE SEEMED TO SHAKE THE FUMES FROM HIS BRAIN AS HE STARED ROUND UPON THEM YOU PACK OF FOOLS HE CRIED WHICH ONE OF YOU KNOWS WHETHER I HAVE SAID IT OR NO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE RATCATCHER'S DAUGHTER IN DOUBLE DUTCH FOR ALL THAT YOUR BESOTTED HEADS CAN TELL
THEN YOU MUST PUT ON MINE YOU DON'T MIND OH NO MY SUNDAY SUIT YOU KNOW IT IS CLOSE HERE IN FACT EVERYTHING WAS CLOSE AND HANDY IN JUDE'S SINGLE CHAMBER BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ROOM FOR IT TO BE OTHERWISE HE OPENED A DRAWER TOOK OUT HIS BEST DARK SUIT
AND REPEATING THE ODD LITTLE SUCKING OPERATION BEFORE MENTIONED JUDE BEING STILL UNCONSCIOUS OF MORE THAN A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF HER APPEARANCE NEXT SUNDAY HE HAZARDED TO MORROW THAT IS YES
BUT DON'T YOU THINK I DESERVE A LITTLE CONSIDERATION FOR CONCEALING MY WRONG VERY WRONG SENTIMENTS SINCE I COULDN'T HELP HAVING THEM SHE TURNED HER EYES DOUBTFULLY TOWARDS HIM AND THEN LOOKED AWAY AS IF AFRAID SHE MIGHT FORGIVE HIM
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ALIKE HE SAID DRILY NOW WE'LL HAVE SOME TEA SAID SUE SHALL WE HAVE IT HERE INSTEAD OF IN MY HOUSE IT IS NO TROUBLE TO GET THE KETTLE AND THINGS BROUGHT IN
BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF HER STORY HER VOICE FALTERED HER HEAD NODDED AND SHE CEASED SHE WAS IN A SOUND SLEEP JUDE DYING OF ANXIETY LEST SHE SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT A CHILL WHICH MIGHT PERMANENTLY INJURE HER
BUT THE FIRST PERSON THEY ENCOUNTERED ON ENTERING THE MAIN STREET WAS THE SCHOOLMASTER HIMSELF WHOSE TRAIN HAD ARRIVED SOONER THAN SUE EXPECTED THERE WAS NOTHING REALLY TO DEMUR TO IN HER LEANING ON JUDE'S ARM BUT SHE WITHDREW HER HAND AND JUDE THOUGHT THAT PHILLOTSON HAD LOOKED SURPRISED
AS IT MEANS NOTHING IT MAY BE BOTHERING HIM NEEDLESSLY
AND OF THE PAIR OF AUTOGRAPHS IN THE VESTRY CHEST OF ARABELLA'S PARISH CHURCH JUDE DID NOT
TO THESE FIVE HE ADDRESSED LETTERS BRIEFLY STATING HIS DIFFICULTIES AND ASKING THEIR OPINION ON HIS STRANDED SITUATION WHEN THE LETTERS WERE POSTED JUDE MENTALLY BEGAN TO CRITICIZE THEM HE WISHED THEY HAD NOT BEEN SENT
TO BEGUILE HIS LONELY WALKS BY IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS THEREIN I HAVE READ TWO BOOKS OF THE ILIAD BESIDES BEING PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH PASSAGES SUCH AS THE SPEECH OF PHOENIX IN THE NINTH BOOK THE FIGHT OF HECTOR AND AJAX IN THE FOURTEENTH
WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO GLAD TO GO BACK TO HER IF IF WHAT YOU USED TO SAY TO ME IS STILL TRUE I MEAN IF IT WERE TRUE THEN OF COURSE IT IS NOT NOW
YET WITHOUT WHOSE DENIZENS THE HARD READERS COULD NOT READ NOR THE HIGH THINKERS LIVE HE LOOKED OVER THE TOWN INTO THE COUNTRY BEYOND TO THE TREES WHICH SCREENED HER WHOSE PRESENCE HAD AT FIRST BEEN THE SUPPORT OF HIS HEART
IT IS NONE OF THE NATURAL TRAGEDIES OF LOVE THAT'S LOVE'S USUAL TRAGEDY IN CIVILIZED LIFE BUT A TRAGEDY ARTIFICIALLY MANUFACTURED FOR PEOPLE WHO IN A NATURAL STATE WOULD FIND RELIEF IN PARTING
AT FOURWAYS MEN HAD STOOD AND TALKED OF NAPOLEON
PLEASE STILL KEEP ME AS YOUR FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE WITH ALL MY FAULTS I'LL TRY NOT TO BE LIKE IT AGAIN
AND UNFORESEEING HE ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE APPEARANCE OF THE AFTERNOON ON WHICH HE AWOKE FROM HIS DREAM NOT QUITE KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF HE WENT UP TO AN OCTAGONAL CHAMBER IN THE LANTERN OF A SINGULARLY BUILT THEATRE
AND GIVING THE GARMENTS A SHAKE SAID NOW HOW LONG SHALL I GIVE YOU TEN MINUTES
BUT HE RECEIVED NO FURTHER COMMUNICATION AND IN THE INTENSITY OF HIS SOLICITUDE HE SENT ANOTHER NOTE SUGGESTING THAT HE SHOULD PAY HER A VISIT SOME SUNDAY THE DISTANCE BEING UNDER EIGHTEEN MILES HE EXPECTED A REPLY ON THE SECOND MORNING AFTER DESPATCHING HIS MISSIVE BUT NONE CAME
IT WAS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE THAT A MAN READING ON HIS OWN SYSTEM HOWEVER WIDELY AND THOROUGHLY EVEN OVER THE PROLONGED PERIOD OF TEN YEARS SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH THOSE WHO HAD PASSED THEIR LIVES UNDER TRAINED TEACHERS
BUT THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE AWOKE HE FELT RATHER VEXED WITH HER AND DECIDED THAT SHE WAS RATHER UNREASONABLE NOT TO SAY CAPRICIOUS
AND WHEN SHE RETURNED FOLLOWED BY THE MAIDEN WITH TEA THEY SAT DOWN BY THE SAME LIGHT ASSISTED BY THE BLUE RAYS OF A SPIRIT LAMP UNDER THE BRASS KETTLE ON THE STAND THIS IS ONE OF YOUR WEDDING PRESENTS TO ME SHE SAID SIGNIFYING THE LATTER YES
AND THESE GIRLS ARE HELPING ME WASH THE INNERDS FOR BLACK PUDDINGS AND SUCH LIKE THEY TALKED A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AS THEY STOOD REGARDING EACH OTHER AND LEANING AGAINST THE HAND RAIL OF THE BRIDGE THE UNVOICED CALL OF WOMAN TO MAN
SHOULD A WEAK SPRINGED INSTRUMENT ENABLE IT TO ESCAPE IT WOULD DIE IN THE FIELDS FROM THE MORTIFICATION OF THE LIMB IF IT WERE A GOOD CATCH NAMELY BY THE FORE LEG THE BONE WOULD BE BROKEN AND THE LIMB NEARLY TORN IN TWO IN ATTEMPTS AT AN IMPOSSIBLE ESCAPE
IN A VOICE BROKEN BY GRIEF AND CONTRITION SHE ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED ANYTHING TO EAT BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD THEN TELLING HIM TO GO TO SLEEP AND THAT SHE WOULD COME DOWN EARLY IN THE MORNING AND GET HIM SOME BREAKFAST SHE BADE HIM GOOD NIGHT
NONE OF THEM COMING OUT TO GREET HER OR TO MAKE INQUIRY WHEN THEY HAD GONE DOWNSTAIRS THEY FOUND THAT SHE DID NOT FOLLOW THEM INTO THE DINING HALL TO BREAKFAST AND THEY THEN LEARNT THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEVERELY REPRIMANDED AND ORDERED TO A SOLITARY ROOM FOR A WEEK THERE TO BE CONFINED AND TAKE HER MEALS
BUT IF IT IS ONLY A SORDID CONTRACT BASED ON MATERIAL CONVENIENCE IN HOUSEHOLDING RATING AND TAXING AND THE INHERITANCE OF LAND AND MONEY BY CHILDREN MAKING IT NECESSARY THAT THE MALE PARENT SHOULD BE KNOWN WHICH IT SEEMS TO BE
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU ANY LONGER JUDE SHE SAID THE TRAGIC CONTRALTO NOTE HAVING COME BACK AS OF OLD IT IS GETTING TOO DARK TO STAY TOGETHER LIKE THIS AFTER PLAYING MORBID GOOD FRIDAY TUNES THAT MAKE ONE FEEL WHAT ONE SHOULDN'T WE MUSTN'T SIT AND TALK IN THIS WAY ANY MORE
SUFFICIENTLY REPRESENTING A NOMINAL RESIDENCE OF FIFTEEN SHE ARRIVED BY THE TEN O'CLOCK TRAIN ON THE DAY AFORESAID JUDE NOT GOING TO MEET HER AT THE STATION BY HER SPECIAL REQUEST THAT HE SHOULD NOT LOSE A MORNING'S WORK AND PAY SHE SAID IF THIS WERE HER TRUE REASON
NO I AM NOT WHAT HAVE I DONE THEN I AM SURE I THOUGHT WE TWO
BUT FOR THIS BLOW HE MIGHT HAVE BORNE WITH HIS FATE WITH SUE AS COMPANION HE COULD HAVE RENOUNCED HIS AMBITIONS WITH A SMILE WITHOUT HER IT WAS INEVITABLE
ALL NOW RUTHLESSLY SWEPT AWAY THROW THE VISITOR EVEN AGAINST HIS WILL INTO A PENSIVE MELANCHOLY WHICH THE STIMULATING ATMOSPHERE AND LIMITLESS LANDSCAPE AROUND HIM CAN SCARCELY DISPEL THE SPOT WAS THE BURIAL PLACE OF A KING AND A QUEEN
I FEEL CRUSHED INTO THE EARTH BY THE WEIGHT OF SO MANY PREVIOUS LIVES THERE SPENT IN A NEW PLACE LIKE THESE SCHOOLS THERE IS ONLY YOUR OWN LIFE TO SUPPORT
HE SAID LOOKING AWAY IT WOULD BE JUST ONE OF THOSE CASES IN WHICH MY EXPERIENCES GO CONTRARY TO MY DOGMAS SPEAKING AS AN ORDER LOVING MAN WHICH I HOPE I AM THOUGH I FEAR I AM NOT I SHOULD SAY YES
WHY SURELY A PERSON MAY SAY EVEN PROCLAIM UPON THE HOUSETOPS THAT IT HURTS AND GRIEVES HIM OR HER I HAVE SAID SO ANYHOW TO YOU PRESENTLY SHE WENT ON
SHE GASPED A LITTLE BUT GULPED IT DOWN AND LAY BACK IN THE ARMCHAIR
JUDE SAID A VOICE TIMIDLY SUE'S VOICE IT IS YOU IS IT NOT YES DEAR I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AT ALL AND THEN I HEARD THE RABBIT AND COULDN'T HELP THINKING OF WHAT IT SUFFERED TILL I FELT I MUST COME DOWN AND KILL IT
EVERY FACE BEARING THE LEGEND THE WEAKER UPON IT AS THE PENALTY OF THE SEX WHEREIN THEY WERE MOULDED WHICH BY NO POSSIBLE EXERTION OF THEIR WILLING HEARTS AND ABILITIES COULD BE MADE STRONG WHILE THE INEXORABLE LAWS OF NATURE REMAIN WHAT THEY ARE THEY FORMED A PRETTY SUGGESTIVE PATHETIC SIGHT
UNWILLING TO ENTER TILL THE CHILDREN WERE DISMISSED HE REMAINED HERE TILL YOUNG VOICES COULD BE HEARD IN THE OPEN AIR AND GIRLS IN WHITE PINAFORES OVER RED AND BLUE FROCKS APPEARED DANCING ALONG THE PATHS
JUDE SOON JOINED THEM AT HIS ROOMS AND SHORTLY AFTER THEY PREPARED FOR THE CEREMONY PHILLOTSON'S HAIR WAS BRUSHED TO A PAINFUL EXTENT AND HIS SHIRT COLLAR APPEARED STIFFER THAN IT HAD BEEN FOR THE PREVIOUS TWENTY YEARS BEYOND THIS HE LOOKED DIGNIFIED AND THOUGHTFUL
AND A GREAT PART OF JUDE'S SHORT DAY WAS OCCUPIED IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR HER COMFORT THE LITTLE BAKERY BUSINESS HAD BEEN SOLD TO A NEIGHBOUR AND WITH THE PROCEEDS OF THIS AND HER SAVINGS SHE WAS COMFORTABLY SUPPLIED WITH NECESSARIES AND MORE
AND IN BRIGHTER TIMES WOULD HAVE INTERESTED HIM SIMPLY BY ITS QUAINTNESS HERE HE SAT MORE OR LESS ALL THE DAY CONVINCED THAT HE WAS AT BOTTOM A VICIOUS CHARACTER OF WHOM IT WAS HOPELESS TO EXPECT ANYTHING
THE NATURAL PICTURESQUENESS AND SINGULARITY OF THE TOWN STILL REMAIN BUT STRANGE TO SAY THESE QUALITIES
THE CENTURIES DID INDEED PONDEROUSLY OVERHANG A YOUNG WIFE WHO PASSED HER TIME HERE SHE HAD OPENED A ROSEWOOD WORK BOX AND WAS LOOKING AT A PHOTOGRAPH HAVING CONTEMPLATED IT A LITTLE WHILE SHE PRESSED IT AGAINST HER BOSOM
AND HIS AIMS HAVING BEEN WHAT THEY WERE FOR SO MANY YEARS EVERYTHING THE OTHERS SAID TURNED UPON HIS TONGUE BY A SORT OF MECHANICAL CRAZE TO THE SUBJECT OF SCHOLARSHIP AND STUDY
NOW YOU'VE BEEN SEEING HER SAID THE HARSH OLD WOMAN AND WHAT DID I TELL EE WELL THAT
PLATO ARISTOTLE LUCRETIUS EPICTETUS SENECA ANTONINUS THEN I MUST MASTER OTHER THINGS THE FATHERS THOROUGHLY
IS THE SCHOOLMASTER SHE SERVED UNDER MISTER PHILLOTSON AND THE OTHER THIS UNDERGRADUATE IN CAP AND GOWN WHO IS HE
IT IS QUITE LIKE THE GENUINE ARTICLE ALL CUT UP INTO VERSES TOO SO THAT IT IS LIKE ONE OF THE OTHER EVANGELISTS READ IN A DREAM WHEN THINGS ARE THE SAME YET NOT THE SAME
ALTHOUGH THE DISTANCE WAS SO SHORT HE HAD HIRED A FLY FROM THE RED LION AND SIX OR SEVEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAD GATHERED BY THE DOOR WHEN THEY CAME OUT THE SCHOOLMASTER AND SUE WERE UNKNOWN THOUGH JUDE WAS GETTING TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A CITIZEN
FOR HE FELT SURE SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED HIS FIRST AND NATURAL THOUGHT HAD BEEN THAT SHE WAS ILL FROM HER IMMERSION
AS JUDE HAD TO GET UP AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO HEAT THE OVEN AND MIX AND SET IN THE BREAD THAT HE DISTRIBUTED LATER IN THE DAY HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO BED AT NIGHT IMMEDIATELY AFTER LAYING THE SPONGE SO THAT IF HE COULD NOT READ HIS CLASSICS ON THE HIGHWAYS
SHE SAID PIQUANTLY I DON'T SUPPOSE I COULD HE ANSWERED THAT'S FOR YOU TO THINK ON THERE'S NOBODY AFTER ME JUST NOW THOUGH THERE MED BE IN A WEEK OR TWO SHE HAD SPOKEN THIS WITHOUT A SMILE AND THE DIMPLES DISAPPEARED
ULTIMATELY HE DECIDED THAT IN HIS SHEER LOVE OF READING HE HAD TAKEN UP A WRONG EMOTION FOR A CHRISTIAN YOUNG MAN HE HAD DABBLED IN CLARKE'S HOMER BUT HAD NEVER YET WORKED MUCH AT THE NEW TESTAMENT IN THE GREEK THOUGH HE POSSESSED A COPY
IT WAS HELL THE HELL OF CONSCIOUS FAILURE BOTH IN AMBITION AND IN LOVE
AND A LOT OF THE GREEK TESTAMENT I WISH THERE WAS ONLY ONE DIALECT ALL THE SAME I HAVE DONE SOME MATHEMATICS INCLUDING THE FIRST SIX AND THE ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH BOOKS OF EUCLID AND ALGEBRA AS FAR AS SIMPLE EQUATIONS I KNOW SOMETHING OF THE FATHERS
JUDE FAWLEY SHOULDERED HIS TOOL BASKET AND RESUMED HIS LONELY WAY FILLED WITH AN ARDOUR AT WHICH HE MENTALLY STOOD AT GAZE HE HAD JUST INHALED A SINGLE BREATH FROM A NEW ATMOSPHERE WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN HANGING ROUND HIM EVERYWHERE HE WENT
THE OTHER COURSE THAT OF BUYING HIMSELF IN SO TO SPEAK SEEMED THE ONLY ONE REALLY OPEN TO MEN LIKE HIM THE DIFFICULTY BEING SIMPLY OF A MATERIAL KIND
THE NEIGHBOUR TOLD ALSO OF SUE'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN OTHER KINDS SHE WAS NOT EXACTLY A TOMBOY YOU KNOW BUT SHE COULD DO THINGS THAT ONLY BOYS DO AS A RULE
AND MADE FRIENDS WITH SEVERAL TO WIT TINKER TAYLOR A DECAYED CHURCH IRONMONGER WHO APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN OF A RELIGIOUS TURN IN EARLIER YEARS BUT WAS SOMEWHAT BLASPHEMOUS NOW ALSO A RED NOSED AUCTIONEER
AS THE RAILWAY COMPANIES SAY OF THEIR TRAINS MISTER PHILLOTSON AND I ARE TO BE MARRIED QUITE SOON IN THREE OR FOUR WEEKS WE HAD INTENDED AS YOU KNOW TO WAIT TILL I HAD GONE THROUGH MY COURSE OF TRAINING AND OBTAINED MY CERTIFICATE SO AS TO ASSIST HIM IF NECESSARY IN THE TEACHING
DEAR SUE HE SAID YOU MUST TAKE OFF ALL YOUR THINGS AND LET ME SEE
MOURNFULLY YET STURDILY THOSE BUILDINGS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND PRIVILEGES WERE NOT FOR HIM FROM THE LOOMING ROOF OF THE GREAT LIBRARY INTO WHICH HE HARDLY EVER HAD TIME TO ENTER HIS GAZE TRAVELLED ON TO THE VARIED SPIRES
SHE CROSSED TO HIS LITTLE GRATE AND VERY LITTLE FIRE BUT AS THE WATER DRIPPED FROM HER AS SHE MOVED THE IDEA OF DRYING HERSELF WAS ABSURD WHATEVER HAVE YOU DONE DARLING HE ASKED WITH ALARM THE TENDER EPITHET SLIPPING OUT UNAWARES
A FASTIDIOUSNESS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE CALLED ALTHOUGH SHE MIGHT RESPECT AND BE GRATEFUL TO HIM I AM MERELY PUTTING A CASE OUGHT SHE TO TRY TO OVERCOME HER PRUDERIES JUDE THREW A TROUBLED LOOK AT HER
AS FOR THE SAKE OF ROOM THEN SUE WROTE TO TELL HIM THE DAY FIXED FOR THE WEDDING AND JUDE DECIDED AFTER INQUIRY THAT SHE SHOULD COME INTO RESIDENCE ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY WHICH WOULD ALLOW OF A TEN DAYS STAY IN THE CITY PRIOR TO THE CEREMONY
JUDE AND THE LANDLADY OFFERED TO GET IT NO SHE SAID RUNNING BACK IT IS MY HANDKERCHIEF I KNOW WHERE I LEFT IT JUDE FOLLOWED HER BACK SHE HAD FOUND IT AND CAME HOLDING IT IN HER HAND SHE LOOKED INTO HIS EYES WITH HER OWN TEARFUL ONES AND HER LIPS SUDDENLY PARTED AS IF SHE WERE GOING TO AVOW SOMETHING
AND THE SUSPENSE WAS OVER JUDE FELT RELIEVED THE MEAL AT HIS LODGING WAS A VERY SIMPLE AFFAIR AND AT TWO O'CLOCK THEY WENT OFF IN CROSSING THE PAVEMENT TO THE FLY SHE LOOKED BACK AND THERE WAS A FRIGHTENED LIGHT IN HER EYES COULD IT BE
AS STRANGE WILD BIRDS ARE SEEN ASSEMBLED ON SOME LOFTY PROMONTORY MEDITATIVELY PAUSING FOR LONGER FLIGHTS OR TO RETURN BY THE COURSE THEY FOLLOWED THITHER SO HERE IN THIS CLIFF TOWN STOOD IN STULTIFIED SILENCE THE YELLOW AND GREEN CARAVANS
HE WHO IN HIS CHILDHOOD HAD SAVED THE LIVES OF THE EARTHWORMS NOW BEGAN TO PICTURE THE AGONIES OF THE RABBIT FROM ITS LACERATED LEG IF IT WERE A BAD CATCH BY THE HIND LEG
IT WAS A VOICE HE GUESSED ITS ORIGIN IN A MOMENT OR TWO THE CURATE WAS PRAYING WITH HIS AUNT IN THE ADJOINING ROOM HE REMEMBERED HER SPEAKING OF HIM PRESENTLY THE SOUNDS CEASED AND A STEP SEEMED TO CROSS THE LANDING
JUDE ASKED POLITELY ACCEPTING HER ASSERTION THOUGH HE HAD VERY LARGE DOUBTS AS TO ITS TRUTH IMPUDENCE DON'T TELL FOLK IT WAS I MIND HOW CAN I I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME AH NO
SUCH IS AND SUCH WAS THE NOW WORLD FORGOTTEN SHASTON OR PALLADOUR ITS SITUATION RENDERED WATER THE GREAT WANT OF THE TOWN AND WITHIN LIVING MEMORY HORSES DONKEYS AND MEN MAY HAVE BEEN SEEN TOILING UP THE WINDING WAYS TO THE TOP OF THE HEIGHT
INSTEAD OF BY HAILING HIM BUT SHE SLYLY LOOKING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
BUT HE GENEROUSLY SAYS HE DOES NOT SEE ANY OBJECT IN WAITING
HE INCLINED TO THEY BUILT IN A CITY THEREFORE HE WOULD LEARN TO BUILD HE THOUGHT OF HIS UNKNOWN UNCLE HIS COUSIN SUSANNA'S FATHER AN ECCLESIASTICAL WORKER IN METAL AND SOMEHOW
ITS INTERIOR WAS THE SCENE OF MOST OF JUDE'S EDUCATION BY PRIVATE STUDY AS SOON AS THE HORSE HAD LEARNT THE ROAD AND THE HOUSES AT WHICH HE WAS TO PAUSE AWHILE THE BOY SEATED IN FRONT WOULD SLIP THE REINS OVER HIS ARM INGENIOUSLY FIX OPEN
BUT SO WELL BY THIS TIME DID HE KNOW SUE THAT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THEIR MUTUAL SENSITIVENESS AT EMOTIONAL CRISES MIGHT HE THOUGHT HAVE WEIGHED WITH HER IN THIS WHEN HE CAME HOME TO DINNER SHE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER APARTMENT
OFTEN AT THIS HOUR AFTER DUSK HE WOULD ENTER THE SILENT CLOSE AND STAND OPPOSITE THE HOUSE THAT CONTAINED SUE AND WATCH THE SHADOWS OF THE GIRLS HEADS PASSING TO AND FRO UPON THE BLINDS
NOW I WON'T WRITE ANY MORE ABOUT THAT YOU DO FORGIVE YOUR THOUGHTLESS FRIEND FOR HER CRUELTY AND WON'T MAKE HER MISERABLE BY SAYING YOU DON'T EVER SUE IT WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS TO SAY WHAT HIS ANSWER WAS
THEIR PROGRESS TO THE CHURCH BEING ALMOST AT A TROT THE BUSTLING UNDERTAKER HAVING A MORE IMPORTANT FUNERAL AN HOUR LATER THREE MILES OFF
WELL COME NOW STAND ME A SMALL SCOTCH COLD AND I'LL DO IT STRAIGHT OFF THAT'S A FAIR OFFER SAID THE UNDERGRADUATE THROWING DOWN THE MONEY FOR THE WHISKY THE BARMAID CONCOCTED THE MIXTURE WITH THE BEARING OF A PERSON COMPELLED TO LIVE AMONGST ANIMALS OF AN INFERIOR SPECIES
AND GRIEVING FOR THE SUFFERER AGAIN AND AGAIN IN ALL HER COLOSSAL INCONSISTENCY PHILLOTSON SEEMED NOT TO NOTICE TO BE SURROUNDED BY A MIST WHICH PREVENTED HIS SEEING THE EMOTIONS OF OTHERS AS SOON AS THEY HAD SIGNED THEIR NAMES AND COME AWAY
WITH THE HELP OF HIS INFORMATION HE BEGAN TO RECKON THE EXTENT OF THIS MATERIAL OBSTACLE AND ASCERTAINED TO HIS DISMAY THAT AT THE RATE AT WHICH WITH THE BEST OF FORTUNE HE WOULD BE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY
I SUPPOSE YOU WILL LIVE WITH HER NOW OF COURSE JUST AS YOU LIVE WITH YOUR HUSBAND
PARTICULAR WAY HE SORROWED YOU OUGHT NOT AND YOU ARE RIGHT YOU BELONG TO MISTER PHILLOTSON I SUPPOSE HE HAS BEEN TO SEE YOU YES SHE SAID SHORTLY HER FACE CHANGING A LITTLE THOUGH I DIDN'T ASK HIM TO COME YOU ARE GLAD OF COURSE THAT HE HAS BEEN
BUT SUE WAS NOT A VERY PRACTICAL OR CALCULATING PERSON AND HE WAS COMPELLED TO THINK THAT A PIQUE AT HAVING HIS SECRET SPRUNG UPON HER HAD MOVED HER TO GIVE WAY TO PHILLOTSON'S PROBABLE REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE BEST COURSE TO PROVE HOW UNFOUNDED WERE THE SUSPICIONS OF THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES WOULD BE TO MARRY HIM OFF HAND
THE CONVERSATION WAXED GENERAL CHRISTMINSTER SOCIETY WAS CRITICIZED THE DONS MAGISTRATES AND OTHER PEOPLE IN AUTHORITY BEING SINCERELY PITIED FOR THEIR SHORTCOMINGS WHILE OPINIONS ON HOW THEY OUGHT TO CONDUCT THEMSELVES AND THEIR AFFAIRS TO BE PROPERLY RESPECTED
IT HAD ALL COME OF READING HEATHEN WORKS EXCLUSIVELY THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE CONVINCED HE WAS OF HIS INCONSISTENCY HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER HE COULD BE READING QUITE THE RIGHT BOOKS FOR HIS OBJECT IN LIFE
HERE JUDE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING AT LEAST THE RUDIMENTS OF FREESTONE WORKING SOME TIME LATER HE WENT TO A CHURCH BUILDER IN THE SAME PLACE AND UNDER THE ARCHITECT'S DIRECTION BECAME HANDY AT RESTORING THE DILAPIDATED MASONRIES OF SEVERAL VILLAGE CHURCHES ROUND ABOUT
IS IT ABOUT US YES BUT DO TELL ME WELL SOMEBODY HAS SENT THEM BASELESS REPORTS ABOUT US AND THEY SAY YOU AND I OUGHT TO MARRY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR THE SAKE OF MY REPUTATION THERE NOW I HAVE TOLD YOU AND I WISH I HADN'T
SUBPRIORESS AND FIFTY NUNS HAD DEMURELY PACED THREE CENTURIES EARLIER RETRACING HIS STEPS HE FOUND THAT HE HAD WAITED TOO LONG AND THAT SUE HAD GONE OUT INTO THE TOWN AT THE HEELS OF THE LAST SCHOLAR
O SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY HE SAID AS HE WORKED YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MARRIAGE MEANS COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT HIS ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS OWN MARRIAGE HAD PRICKED HER ON TO THIS
YE'VE GOT THERE RIGHT ENOUGH THEN JUDE SHOWED THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY TO THE SEAT OF L'ARNING THE CITY OF LIGHT YOU USED TO TALK TO US ABOUT AS A LITTLE BOY
SO FATIGUED WAS HE SOMETIMES AFTER HIS DAY'S WORK THAT HE COULD NOT MAINTAIN THE CRITICAL ATTENTION NECESSARY FOR THOROUGH APPLICATION HE FELT THAT HE WANTED A COACH A FRIEND AT HIS ELBOW TO TELL HIM IN A MOMENT
THERE CAME TO DISTURB HIS CALM HIS HOPELESS RELATIONS WITH SUE THAT THE ONE AFFINED SOUL HE HAD EVER MET WAS LOST TO HIM THROUGH HIS MARRIAGE RETURNED UPON HIM WITH CRUEL PERSISTENCY TILL UNABLE TO BEAR IT LONGER
WITHIN THE MULLIONED AND TRANSOMED WINDOWS HE COULD SEE THE BLACK BROWN AND FLAXEN CROWNS OF THE SCHOLARS OVER THE SILLS AND TO PASS THE TIME AWAY HE WALKED DOWN TO THE LEVEL TERRACE WHERE THE ABBEY GARDENS ONCE HAD SPREAD HIS HEART THROBBING IN SPITE OF HIM
HE THOUGHT HE HEARD THE WHEELS OF THE COACH DEPARTING AND TRULY ENOUGH WHEN HE REACHED THE DUKE'S ARMS IN THE MARKET PLACE THE COACH HAD GONE
HAVE TO THE REAL STAR PATTERNS I AM CALLED MISSUS RICHARD PHILLOTSON LIVING A CALM WEDDED LIFE WITH MY COUNTERPART OF THAT NAME BUT I AM NOT REALLY MISSUS RICHARD PHILLOTSON BUT A WOMAN TOSSED ABOUT
MISSUS EDLIN HAS PLENTY OF ROOM IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO STAY HERE VERY WELL SHE SAID DUBIOUSLY I DIDN'T TELL HIM I WOULD COME FOR CERTAIN
BUT I FORGET I AM NO LONGER PRIVILEGED TO TEASE YOU EVER SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD JUDE SCREWED HIMSELF UP TO HEROIC KEY AND REPLIED MY DEAR SUE OF COURSE I WISH YOU JOY
NOW ABANDONED PECKED ITS NEIGHBOUR SMARTLY AND THE VANE ON THE NEW VICTORIAN GOTHIC CHURCH IN THE NEW SPOT HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CREAK
WE WON'T GET ON TO THAT NOW SHE COAXED WILL YOU BE CARVING OUT AT THAT CHURCH AGAIN NEXT WEEK WHERE YOU LEARNT THE PRETTY HYMN YES PERHAPS THAT WILL BE VERY NICE SHALL I COME AND SEE YOU THERE
I WAS OLD ENOUGH AND I THOUGHT I WAS VERY EXPERIENCED SO I RUSHED ON WHEN I HAD GOT INTO THAT TRAINING SCHOOL SCRAPE WITH ALL THE COCK SURENESS OF THE FOOL THAT I WAS
THE BURNING OF THE MARTYRS THE CRUSADES THE NORMAN CONQUEST POSSIBLY OF THE ARRIVAL OF CAESAR HERE THE TWO SEXES HAD MET FOR LOVING HATING COUPLING PARTING HAD WAITED HAD SUFFERED FOR EACH OTHER HAD TRIUMPHED OVER EACH OTHER
ONLY MADE JUDE THE MORE MISERABLE THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO WOO HER AND HE LEFT THE COTTAGE OF HIS AUNT THAT DAY WITH A HEAVY HEART HE WOULD FAIN HAVE GLANCED INTO THE SCHOOL TO SEE THE ROOM IN WHICH SUE'S LITTLE FIGURE HAD SO GLORIFIED ITSELF
ET UNAM CATHOLICAM ET APOSTOLICAM ECCLESIAM
HIS SMALL SAVINGS DEPOSITED AT ONE OF THE BANKS IN CHRISTMINSTER HAVING FORTUNATELY BEEN LEFT UNTOUCHED TO GET TO MARYGREEN THEREFORE HIS ONLY COURSE WAS WALKING AND THE DISTANCE BEING NEARLY TWENTY MILES
KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES THE BONES OF KING EDWARD THE MARTYR CAREFULLY REMOVED HITHER FOR HOLY PRESERVATION BROUGHT SHASTON A RENOWN WHICH MADE IT THE RESORT OF PILGRIMS FROM EVERY PART OF EUROPE
IT WAS NOT TILL THE TIME HAD NEARLY COME FOR HIM TO LEAVE THAT HE OBTAINED A QUIET TALK WITH HER AND HIS WORDS TENDED INSENSIBLY TOWARDS HIS COUSIN WAS SUE BORN HERE SHE WAS
THAT THOUGH I LIKE MISTER PHILLOTSON AS A FRIEND I DON'T LIKE HIM IT IS A TORTURE TO ME TO LIVE WITH HIM AS A HUSBAND THERE NOW I HAVE LET IT OUT I COULDN'T HELP IT ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN PRETENDING I AM HAPPY
AT NINE O'CLOCK THE NAMES WERE CALLED SUE'S BEING PRONOUNCED THREE TIMES SONOROUSLY BY MISS TRACELEY WITHOUT ELICITING AN ANSWER
IN THE EVENING THE FREQUENTERS OF THE HOUSE DROPPED IN ONE BY ONE JUDE STILL RETAINING HIS SEAT IN THE CORNER THOUGH HIS MONEY WAS ALL SPENT AND HE HAD NOT EATEN ANYTHING THE WHOLE DAY EXCEPT A BISCUIT
NO MORE NO LESS AND JUDE WAS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT TO HER WAS ATTRIBUTABLE THE ENTERPRISE OF ATTRACTING HIS ATTENTION FROM DREAMS OF THE HUMANER LETTERS TO WHAT WAS SIMMERING IN THE MINDS AROUND HIM THAT YOU'LL NEVER BE TOLD
AND DO ALL HER READING AT THIS THE SEVENTY MURMURED THE SENTENCE BEING THEY THOUGHT TOO SEVERE A ROUND ROBIN WAS PREPARED AND SENT IN TO THE PRINCIPAL ASKING FOR A REMISSION OF SUE'S PUNISHMENT NO NOTICE WAS TAKEN
ONCE THERE I SHALL SO ADVANCE WITH THE ASSISTANCE I SHALL THERE GET THAT MY PRESENT KNOWLEDGE WILL APPEAR TO ME BUT AS CHILDISH IGNORANCE I MUST SAVE MONEY AND I WILL AND ONE OF THOSE COLLEGES SHALL OPEN ITS DOORS TO ME
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER FOR HIM IN EVERY WAY IF HE HAD NEVER COME WITHIN SIGHT AND SOUND OF THE DELUSIVE PRECINCTS HAD GONE TO SOME BUSY COMMERCIAL TOWN WITH THE SOLE OBJECT OF MAKING MONEY BY HIS WITS
ONE OF THE MISTRESSES CAME IN TO TURN OUT THE LIGHTS AND BEFORE DOING SO GAVE A FINAL GLANCE AT SUE'S COT WHICH REMAINED EMPTY
I WISH HE WOULD BEAT ME OR BE FAITHLESS TO ME OR DO SOME OPEN THING THAT I COULD TALK ABOUT AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR FEELING AS I DO BUT HE DOES NOTHING EXCEPT THAT HE HAS GROWN A LITTLE COLD SINCE HE HAS FOUND OUT HOW I FEEL
WENT ON IN A MOMENT IN A REVIVED VOICE RAISING IT AS HE NEARED THE END WITH THE MANNER OF A PRIEST LEADING A CONGREGATION ET IN SPIRITUM SANCTUM DOMINUM ET VIVIFICANTEM
IT LOOKS SO ODD OVER A BONNET SHE SAID I'LL TAKE THE BONNET OFF OH NO LET IT STAY SAID PHILLOTSON AND SHE OBEYED WHEN THEY HAD PASSED UP THE CHURCH AND WERE STANDING IN THEIR PLACES
NAMELY THAT THE CHIEF GRAVEYARD SLOPES UP AS STEEPLY AS A ROOF BEHIND THE CHURCH AND THAT IN FORMER TIMES THE TOWN PASSED THROUGH A CURIOUS PERIOD OF CORRUPTION CONVENTUAL AND DOMESTIC
SUE WAS SILENT IS IT WRONG JUDE SHE SAID WITH A TENTATIVE TREMOR FOR A HUSBAND OR WIFE TO TELL A THIRD PERSON THAT THEY ARE UNHAPPY IN THEIR MARRIAGE IF A MARRIAGE CEREMONY IS A RELIGIOUS THING IT IS POSSIBLY WRONG
THIS YOUNG MAN WAS DISCHARGED FROM HIS WORK AT CHRISTMINSTER FOR DRUNKENNESS AND BLASPHEMY IN PUBLIC HOUSES AND HE HAS COME HERE TO LIVE ENTIRELY TO BE NEAR HER HOWEVER THEY REMAINED STOLID AND MOTIONLESS AND THE MISTRESS LEFT THE ROOM TO INQUIRE FROM HER SUPERIORS WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
WHAT TORTURES ME SO MUCH IS THE NECESSITY OF BEING RESPONSIVE TO THIS MAN WHENEVER HE WISHES GOOD AS HE IS MORALLY THE DREADFUL CONTRACT TO FEEL IN A PARTICULAR WAY IN A MATTER WHOSE ESSENCE IS ITS VOLUNTARINESS
FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER AN INCOME FROM ANY WORK IN PREPARING THE FIRST WOULD BE TOO MEAGRE FOR MAKING THE SECOND HE FELT A DISTASTE
WOULD HAVE SHUNNED SUCH ENCOUNTERS IF THEY DOUBTED THEIR OWN STRENGTH BUT HE COULD NOT
WHOM HE FOUND BREAKFASTING IN BED ATTENDED BY THE WOMAN WHO LIVED WITH HER WHAT OUT O WORK ASKED HIS RELATIVE REGARDING HIM THROUGH EYES SUNKEN DEEP UNDER LIDS HEAVY AS POT COVERS
AND I'LL BE HER BELOVED SON IN WHOM SHE SHALL BE WELL PLEASED IN HIS DEEP CONCENTRATION ON THESE TRANSACTIONS OF THE FUTURE JUDE'S WALK HAD SLACKENED AND HE WAS NOW STANDING QUITE STILL
AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED AND HE MOVED HIS HAND TOWARDS HERS IT MET HIS OWN HALF WAY JUDE GRASPED IT JUST AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE HER MARRIAGE IT IS ODD SHE SAID IN A VOICE QUITE CHANGED THAT I SHOULD CARE ABOUT THAT AIR BECAUSE
A LITTLE GIRL OPENED THE DOOR MISS BRIDEHEAD IS UP STAIRS SHE SAID AND WILL YOU PLEASE WALK UP TO HER IS SHE ILL ASKED JUDE HASTILY ONLY A LITTLE NOT VERY JUDE ENTERED AND ASCENDED
MEANWHILE THERE CAME ANOTHER NOTE FROM HIS IMPATIENT LITTLE DEAR JUDE WILL YOU GIVE ME AWAY I HAVE NOBODY ELSE WHO COULD DO IT SO CONVENIENTLY AS YOU BEING THE ONLY MARRIED RELATION I HAVE HERE ON THE SPOT EVEN IF MY FATHER WERE FRIENDLY ENOUGH TO BE WILLING WHICH HE ISN'T
ON REACHING THE LANDING A VOICE TOLD HIM WHICH WAY TO TURN THE VOICE OF SUE CALLING HIS NAME HE PASSED THE DOORWAY AND FOUND HER LYING IN A LITTLE BED IN A ROOM A DOZEN FEET SQUARE OH SUE HE CRIED SITTING DOWN BESIDE HER AND TAKING HER HAND HOW IS THIS YOU COULDN'T WRITE
ALMOST AS IF SHE LOVED HIM CRUELLY SWEET INDEED SHE HAD BEEN TO HIM THAT MORNING BUT HIS THOUGHTS OF A PENANCE IN STORE FOR HER WERE TEMPERED BY AN ACHE
WHO HAD MADE THE SAME STATEMENT IN ORDER TO GAIN MEETINGS WITH HER LOVER THE AFFAIR HAD CREATED A SCANDAL AND THE MANAGEMENT HAD CONSEQUENTLY BEEN ROUGH ON COUSINS EVER SINCE
BUT JUDE DO YOU TAKE AN INTEREST IN THOSE QUESTIONS STILL ARE YOU GETTING UP APOLOGETICA YES I AM READING DIVINITY HARDER THAN EVER SHE REGARDED HIM CURIOUSLY WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT SAID JUDE
WHAT YOU KNOW HIM I WENT TO SEE HIM
AND IN A SECOND OR TWO THE DOOR WAS UNLOCKED AND OPENED AND SUE APPEARED WITH A CANDLE IN HER HAND IS IT JUDE YES IT IS MY DEAR DEAR COUSIN WHAT'S THE MATTER OH I AM
AND WONDERED IF SUE WOULD COME SHE HAD NOT WRITTEN AND THAT SEEMED TO SIGNIFY RATHER THAT SHE WOULD COME THAN THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVING TIMED HER BY HER ONLY POSSIBLE TRAIN HE LOCKED THE DOOR ABOUT MID DAY
WITH THE CONSOLATION OF SWEET SUE WHILE FOR HIM THERE WAS NO CONSOLER DESCENDING TO THE STREETS HE WENT LISTLESSLY ALONG TILL HE ARRIVED AT AN INN AND ENTERED IT HERE HE DRANK SEVERAL GLASSES OF BEER IN RAPID SUCCESSION
WHO MUST HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION FOR SHE BEGAN A COMMENTARY ON PAST YEARS INTRODUCING SUE BRIDEHEAD AS A CHARACTER IN HER RECOLLECTIONS SHE DESCRIBED WHAT AN ODD LITTLE MAID SUE HAD BEEN WHEN A PUPIL AT THE VILLAGE SCHOOL
WHEN IT WAS BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN O'CLOCK HE ENTERED THE VILLAGE OF LUMSDON AND REACHING THE COTTAGE SAW THAT A LIGHT WAS BURNING IN A DOWNSTAIRS ROOM WHICH HE ASSUMED RIGHTLY AS IT HAPPENED TO BE HERS
AND INSISTED THAT IT WAS THE CONSTABLE'S DUTY TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT AND TAKE HIM TO THE POLICE COURT AT ALFREDSTON AND GET HIM FINED FOR DANGEROUS PRACTICES ON THE HIGHWAY THE POLICEMAN THEREUPON LAY IN WAIT FOR JUDE AND ONE DAY ACCOSTED HIM AND CAUTIONED HIM
AFTER BREAKFAST THEY WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND TOGETHER MOVED BY A MUTUAL THOUGHT THAT IT WAS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY THEY WOULD HAVE OF INDULGING IN UNCEREMONIOUS COMPANIONSHIP BY THE IRONY OF FATE
IN HIS ROOM THE PARLOUR WHICH HE HAD HIRED FOR THE PERIOD OF SUE'S RESIDENCE SEEING AS WOMEN DO HOW HELPLESS HE WAS IN MAKING THE PLACE COMFORTABLE SHE BUSTLED ABOUT WHAT'S THE MATTER JUDE SHE SAID SUDDENLY
AS WAS THE LITTLE CREATURE'S HABIT IT DID NOT SOON REPEAT ITS CRY AND PROBABLY WOULD NOT DO SO MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE BUT WOULD REMAIN BEARING ITS TORTURE TILL THE MORROW WHEN THE TRAPPER WOULD COME AND KNOCK IT ON THE HEAD
POOR AUNT DRUSILLA IT WAS AS HE HAD SUPPOSED AND MISSUS EDLIN HAD SENT OUT THE MAN TO BREAK THE NEWS TO HIM
IF HE HAD BEEN A WOMAN HE MUST HAVE SCREAMED UNDER THE NERVOUS TENSION WHICH HE WAS NOW UNDERGOING BUT THAT RELIEF BEING DENIED TO HIS VIRILITY HE CLENCHED HIS TEETH IN MISERY BRINGING LINES ABOUT HIS MOUTH LIKE THOSE IN THE LAOCOON
PIGS WERE RATHER PLENTIFUL HEREABOUT BEING BRED AND FATTENED IN LARGE NUMBERS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF NORTH WESSEX ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE WAS A STREAM WHENCE AS HE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME REALIZED HAD COME THE SLIGHT SOUNDS OF VOICES AND LAUGHTER
SHE LOOKED AT THE WINDOW POTS WITH THE GERANIUMS AND CACTUSES WITHERED FOR WANT OF ATTENTION AND THROUGH THEM AT THE OUTER DISTANCE TILL HER EYES BEGAN TO GROW MOIST WHAT IS IT SAID JUDE IN A SOFTENED TONE
AND THAT HE WAS WATCHING THEM THEY BRACED THEMSELVES FOR INSPECTION BY PUTTING THEIR MOUTHS DEMURELY INTO SHAPE AND RECOMMENCING THEIR RINSING OPERATIONS WITH ASSIDUITY THANK YOU SAID JUDE SEVERELY
AND WROTE ALONG THE WALL I HAVE UNDERSTANDING AS WELL AS YOU I AM NOT INFERIOR TO YOU YEA WHO KNOWETH NOT SUCH THINGS AS THESE
WHETHER AS SEEMED POSSIBLE IT WAS A PRACTICAL MOVE OF THE SCHOOLMASTER'S TOWARDS A LARGER INCOME IN VIEW OF A PROVISION FOR TWO INSTEAD OF ONE HE WOULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO SAY
IT SEEMED BENIGN CONSIDERATE YET RATHER RESERVED ON SECOND THOUGHTS JUDE FELT THAT HE COULD NOT GO UP AND ADDRESS HIM BUT HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY INFLUENCED BY THE INCIDENT TO THINK WHAT A WISE THING IT WOULD BE FOR HIM TO STATE HIS DIFFICULTIES
AND AT HER LITTLE DRESSING TABLE AT THE FOOT WHICH LIKE ALL THE REST WAS ORNAMENTED WITH VARIOUS GIRLISH TRIFLES FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS BEING NOT THE LEAST CONSPICUOUS AMONG THEM SUE'S TABLE HAD A MODERATE SHOW
THE MOUNTAIN WEIGHT OF MATERIAL UNDER WHICH THE IDEAS LAY IN THOSE DUSTY VOLUMES CALLED THE CLASSICS PIQUED HIM INTO A DOGGED MOUSELIKE SUBTLETY OF ATTEMPT TO MOVE IT PIECEMEAL
SHE SHAKES DOWN TO WITH COMFORTABLE INDIFFERENCE IN HALF A DOZEN YEARS BUT THAT IS MUCH LIKE SAYING THAT THE AMPUTATION OF A LIMB IS NO AFFLICTION SINCE A PERSON GETS COMFORTABLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE USE OF A WOODEN LEG OR ARM IN THE COURSE OF TIME
CATCHED UN MY DEAR LACONICALLY ASKED THE GIRL CALLED ANNY I DON'T KNOW I WISH I HAD THROWN SOMETHING ELSE THAN THAT REGRETFULLY MURMURED ARABELLA LORD HE'S NOBODY THOUGH YOU MED THINK SO
AND THE COUPLE WERE JUDGED TO BE SOME RELATIONS OF HIS FROM A DISTANCE NOBODY SUPPOSING SUE TO HAVE BEEN A RECENT PUPIL AT THE TRAINING SCHOOL IN THE CARRIAGE JUDE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET HIS EXTRA LITTLE WEDDING PRESENT WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE TWO OR THREE YARDS OF WHITE TULLE
WALKED THROUGH THE LARGEST RIVER IN THE COUNTY THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE THEY LOCKED ME UP FOR BEING OUT WITH YOU AND IT SEEMED SO UNJUST THAT I COULDN'T BEAR IT SO I GOT OUT OF THE WINDOW AND ESCAPED ACROSS THE STREAM
WHENCE HE RETURNED WITH A LITTLE BOTTLE IN HIS HAND HERE'S SIX OF BEST BRANDY HE SAID NOW YOU DRINK IT DEAR ALL OF IT I CAN'T OUT OF THE BOTTLE CAN I JUDE FETCHED THE GLASS FROM THE DRESSING TABLE AND ADMINISTERED THE SPIRIT IN SOME WATER
AND WHEN HE CAME OUT IT WAS NIGHT BY THE LIGHT OF THE FLICKERING LAMPS HE RAMBLED HOME TO SUPPER AND HAD NOT LONG BEEN SITTING AT TABLE WHEN HIS LANDLADY BROUGHT UP A LETTER THAT HAD JUST ARRIVED FOR HIM SHE LAID IT DOWN AS IF IMPRESSED
THEY ARE FOR SUCH ONES STILL THE REMARK WAS SUFFICIENT TO WITHDRAW JUDE'S ATTENTION FROM THE IMAGINATIVE WORLD HE HAD LATELY INHABITED IN WHICH AN ABSTRACT FIGURE MORE OR LESS HIMSELF
OUT OF THE DEEP ALLUVIAL VALE OF BLACKMOOR THE VIEW FROM THE CASTLE GREEN OVER THREE COUNTIES OF VERDANT PASTURE SOUTH MID AND NETHER WESSEX BEING AS SUDDEN A SURPRISE TO THE UNEXPECTANT TRAVELLER'S EYES
THE FAINT CLICK OF THE TRAP AS DRAGGED ABOUT BY THE WRITHING ANIMAL GUIDED HIM NOW AND REACHING THE SPOT HE STRUCK THE RABBIT ON THE BACK OF THE NECK WITH THE SIDE OF HIS PALM AND IT STRETCHED ITSELF OUT DEAD
THE ONLY COPIES HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO LAY HANDS ON WERE OLD DELPHIN EDITIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE SUPERSEDED AND THEREFORE CHEAP
HERE COMES THIS DEAR OLD BEAU OF MINE I PROTEST ONLY THINK OF HIS GALLANTRY IN COMING AWAY BEFORE THE OTHER MEN WHAT A DEAR CREATURE HE IS I ASSURE YOU I LIKE HIM EXCESSIVELY
HE HAD RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER AFTER SOME DAYS ABSENCE
BUT I MEANT NO REFLECTION ON ANY BODY MISS TAYLOR HAS BEEN USED TO HAVE TWO PERSONS TO PLEASE SHE WILL NOW HAVE BUT ONE THE CHANCES ARE THAT SHE MUST BE A GAINER WELL SAID EMMA WILLING TO LET IT PASS
THERE IS HARDLY ANY DESIRING TO REFRESH SUCH A MEMORY AS THAT SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY FEELINGLY AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE HAD DONE BUT I HE SOON ADDED WHO HAVE HAD NO SUCH CHARM THROWN OVER MY SENSES
NOT FIVE MINUTES TO SPARE EVEN FOR YOUR FRIENDS MISS FAIRFAX AND MISS BATES HOW UNLUCKY
AND PROFESSIONS OF MISSUS ELTON'S MEDITATED ACTIVITY HERE IS APRIL COME SAID SHE I GET QUITE ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU JUNE WILL SOON BE HERE BUT I HAVE NEVER FIXED ON JUNE OR ANY OTHER MONTH
AND WHO SEEMED SO PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITHOUT A WIFE SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL
BUT NEVER DID SHE GO WITHOUT MISTER WOODHOUSE'S GIVING A GENTLE SIGH AND SAYING AH POOR MISS TAYLOR SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO STAY
HAVING BROTHERS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN A GOOD WAY IN LONDON WHICH AFFORDED HIM A FAVOURABLE OPENING IT WAS A CONCERN WHICH BROUGHT JUST EMPLOYMENT ENOUGH HE HAD STILL A SMALL HOUSE IN HIGHBURY
ISABELLA SLOW AND DIFFIDENT AND EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE EMMA HAS BEEN MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AND OF YOU ALL IN HER MOTHER SHE LOST THE ONLY PERSON ABLE TO COPE WITH HER SHE INHERITS HER MOTHER'S TALENTS AND MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER SUBJECTION TO HER
BY THE BYE I HAVE NOT WISHED YOU JOY BEING PRETTY WELL AWARE OF WHAT SORT OF JOY YOU MUST BOTH BE FEELING I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST
I DID NOT MEAN I WAS NOT THINKING OF THE SLAVE TRADE REPLIED JANE GOVERNESS TRADE I ASSURE YOU WAS ALL THAT I HAD IN VIEW WIDELY DIFFERENT CERTAINLY AS TO THE GUILT OF THOSE WHO CARRY IT ON
CERTAINLY HIS BEING AT RANDALLS HAD GIVEN GREAT SPIRIT TO THE LAST TWO WEEKS INDESCRIBABLE SPIRIT
YOUR MAKING THE MATCH AS YOU CALL IT MEANS ONLY YOUR PLANNING IT YOUR SAYING TO YOURSELF ONE IDLE DAY I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FOR MISS TAYLOR IF MISTER WESTON WERE TO MARRY HER
AND IT MADE HER QUITE ANGRY IT WAS NOT IN COMPLIMENT TO JANE FAIRFAX HOWEVER THAT HE WAS SO INDIFFERENT OR SO INDIGNANT HE WAS NOT GUIDED BY HER FEELINGS IN REPROBATING THE BALL FOR SHE ENJOYED THE THOUGHT OF IT TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE
ENOUGH TO SECURE THE PURCHASE OF A LITTLE ESTATE ADJOINING HIGHBURY WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS LONGED FOR ENOUGH TO MARRY A WOMAN AS PORTIONLESS EVEN AS MISS TAYLOR
THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER
BEING SETTLED IN LONDON ONLY SIXTEEN MILES OFF WAS MUCH BEYOND HER DAILY REACH
YOU EMMA WHO HAVE SO FEW OPPORTUNITIES OF DANCING YOU ARE REALLY OUT OF LUCK YOU ARE VERY MUCH OUT OF LUCK IT WAS SOME DAYS BEFORE SHE SAW JANE FAIRFAX TO JUDGE OF HER HONEST REGRET IN THIS WOEFUL CHANGE BUT WHEN THEY DID MEET HER COMPOSURE WAS ODIOUS
ONLY ONE MORE PAPA ONLY FOR MISTER ELTON POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM
HARTFIELD WILL ONLY PUT HER OUT OF CONCEIT WITH ALL THE OTHER PLACES SHE BELONGS TO SHE WILL GROW JUST REFINED ENOUGH TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THOSE AMONG WHOM BIRTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE PLACED HER HOME
FOR WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES I PROMISE YOU TO MAKE NONE FOR MYSELF PAPA BUT I MUST INDEED FOR OTHER PEOPLE IT IS THE GREATEST AMUSEMENT IN THE WORLD AND AFTER SUCH SUCCESS YOU KNOW
DO NOT WE RATHER SURPASS YOUR EXPECTATIONS I AM SURE WE DO I AM SURE YOU DID NOT MUCH EXPECT TO LIKE US YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO LONG IN COMING IF YOU HAD HAD A PLEASANT IDEA OF HIGHBURY HE LAUGHED RATHER CONSCIOUSLY AND THOUGH DENYING THE SENTIMENT
AND I AGREE WITH YOU ENTIRELY THAT IT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING INVITE HIM TO DINNER EMMA AND HELP HIM TO THE BEST OF THE FISH AND THE CHICKEN
THE LIST SHE DREW UP WHEN ONLY FOURTEEN I REMEMBER THINKING IT DID HER JUDGMENT SO MUCH CREDIT THAT I PRESERVED IT SOME TIME AND I DARE SAY SHE MAY HAVE MADE OUT A VERY GOOD LIST NOW BUT I HAVE DONE WITH EXPECTING ANY COURSE OF STEADY READING FROM EMMA
AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL
WHEN IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW MOTHER ON THE OCCASION FOR A FEW DAYS EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY INCLUDED SOME MENTION OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISSUS WESTON HAD RECEIVED
AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER THOUGH COMPARATIVELY BUT LITTLE REMOVED BY MATRIMONY
OF FINISHING HIS DAY IN THE EFFORTS OF CIVILITY AND THE NOISE OF NUMBERS WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO STRIKE HIM DEEPLY A MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN MOTION SINCE EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN STILL WHO HAD BEEN LONG TALKING AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN SILENT
THAT A TRAIN OF TWENTY YOUNG COUPLE NOW WALKED AFTER HER TO CHURCH SHE WAS A PLAIN MOTHERLY KIND OF WOMAN WHO HAD WORKED HARD IN HER YOUTH AND NOW THOUGHT HERSELF ENTITLED TO THE OCCASIONAL HOLIDAY OF A TEA VISIT
SUCCESS SUPPOSES ENDEAVOUR YOUR TIME HAS BEEN PROPERLY AND DELICATELY SPENT IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND
THE BACKGAMMON TABLE WAS PLACED BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WALKED IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY MISTER KNIGHTLEY A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT AND THIRTY WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY
AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE
THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHEN I MAY BE ABLE TO RETURN
BUT STILL THE CAKE WAS EATEN AND THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIS BENEVOLENT NERVES TILL IT WAS ALL GONE
THE REAL EVILS INDEED OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO WELL OF HERSELF
THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS
YOU NEVER COULD PERSUADE HER TO READ HALF SO MUCH AS YOU WISHED YOU KNOW YOU COULD NOT I DARE SAY REPLIED MISSUS WESTON SMILING THAT I THOUGHT SO THEN BUT SINCE WE HAVE PARTED I CAN NEVER REMEMBER EMMA'S OMITTING TO DO ANY THING I WISHED
OUR POOR BALL MUST BE QUITE GIVEN UP AH THAT BALL WHY DID WE WAIT FOR ANY THING WHY NOT SEIZE THE PLEASURE AT ONCE HOW OFTEN IS HAPPINESS DESTROYED BY PREPARATION FOOLISH PREPARATION YOU TOLD US IT WOULD BE SO
SHE WILL NEVER SUBMIT TO ANY THING REQUIRING INDUSTRY AND PATIENCE AND A SUBJECTION OF THE FANCY TO THE UNDERSTANDING WHERE MISS TAYLOR FAILED TO STIMULATE I MAY SAFELY AFFIRM THAT HARRIET SMITH WILL DO NOTHING
SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF
IN THIS STYLE SHE RAN ON NEVER THOROUGHLY STOPPED BY ANY THING TILL MISTER WOODHOUSE CAME INTO THE ROOM HER VANITY HAD THEN A CHANGE OF OBJECT AND EMMA HEARD HER SAYING IN THE SAME HALF WHISPER TO JANE
FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS
READ IT READ IT SAID HE IT WILL GIVE YOU PLEASURE ONLY A FEW LINES WILL NOT TAKE YOU LONG READ IT TO EMMA
EVERY DAY MAKING ME LESS FIT TO BEAR ANY OTHER PLACE HAPPY THOSE WHO CAN REMAIN AT HIGHBURY AS YOU DO US SUCH AMPLE JUSTICE NOW SAID EMMA LAUGHING I WILL VENTURE TO ASK WHETHER YOU DID NOT COME A LITTLE DOUBTFULLY AT FIRST
AND SOMEBODY HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR TO THAT OF PARLOUR BOARDER THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN OF HER HISTORY SHE HAD NO VISIBLE FRIENDS BUT WHAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED AT HIGHBURY
FOR IN SPITE OF MISTER WESTON'S CONFIDENCE SHE COULD NOT THINK IT SO VERY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE CHURCHILLS MIGHT NOT ALLOW THEIR NEPHEW TO REMAIN A DAY BEYOND HIS FORTNIGHT BUT THIS WAS NOT JUDGED FEASIBLE THE PREPARATIONS MUST TAKE THEIR TIME
TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MISTER WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS YOUTH
TILL THEY WERE ACCOMPLISHED HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE BOUGHT HIS HOUSE AND OBTAINED HIS WIFE AND WAS BEGINNING A NEW PERIOD OF EXISTENCE WITH EVERY PROBABILITY OF GREATER HAPPINESS THAN IN ANY YET PASSED THROUGH
OH YOU WOULD RATHER TALK OF HER PERSON THAN HER MIND WOULD YOU VERY WELL I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY EMMA'S BEING PRETTY PRETTY SAY BEAUTIFUL RATHER CAN YOU IMAGINE ANY THING NEARER PERFECT BEAUTY THAN EMMA ALTOGETHER
AND THE SHADOW OF AUTHORITY BEING NOW LONG PASSED AWAY THEY HAD BEEN LIVING TOGETHER AS FRIEND AND FRIEND VERY MUTUALLY ATTACHED AND EMMA DOING JUST WHAT SHE LIKED HIGHLY ESTEEMING MISS TAYLOR'S JUDGMENT BUT DIRECTED CHIEFLY BY HER OWN
ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE WITH AN ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE OF A SPIRIT
AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY
THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS
OR MY DREAD OF ITS DOING THEM BOTH HARM AND I MISTER KNIGHTLEY AM EQUALLY STOUT IN MY CONFIDENCE OF ITS NOT DOING THEM ANY HARM WITH ALL DEAR EMMA'S LITTLE FAULTS SHE IS AN EXCELLENT CREATURE WHERE SHALL WE SEE A BETTER DAUGHTER
WHO HAD FALLEN LITTLE SHORT OF A MOTHER IN AFFECTION SIXTEEN YEARS HAD MISS TAYLOR BEEN IN MISTER WOODHOUSE'S FAMILY LESS AS A GOVERNESS THAN A FRIEND VERY FOND OF BOTH DAUGHTERS BUT PARTICULARLY OF EMMA
BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL
MISSUS WESTON ADDED THAT HE COULD ONLY ALLOW HIMSELF TIME TO HURRY TO HIGHBURY
AND YOU MUST BE OFF THIS VERY MORNING YES MY FATHER IS TO JOIN ME HERE WE SHALL WALK BACK TOGETHER AND I MUST BE OFF IMMEDIATELY I AM ALMOST AFRAID THAT EVERY MOMENT WILL BRING HIM
I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT
BUT YOU WERE PREPARING YOURSELF TO BE AN EXCELLENT WIFE ALL THE TIME YOU WERE AT HARTFIELD YOU MIGHT NOT GIVE EMMA SUCH A COMPLETE EDUCATION AS YOUR POWERS WOULD SEEM TO PROMISE BUT YOU WERE RECEIVING A VERY GOOD EDUCATION FROM HER
WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF COMING BACK PRODIGIES MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL WAS IN HIGH REPUTE AND VERY DESERVEDLY FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD
WHAT A BLOOM OF FULL HEALTH AND SUCH A PRETTY HEIGHT AND SIZE SUCH A FIRM AND UPRIGHT FIGURE THERE IS HEALTH NOT MERELY IN HER BLOOM BUT IN HER AIR HER HEAD HER GLANCE ONE HEARS SOMETIMES OF A CHILD BEING THE PICTURE OF HEALTH
UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART BUT MY DEAR PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES THEY ARE SILLY THINGS AND BREAK UP ONE'S FAMILY CIRCLE GRIEVOUSLY
ALL WAS SAFE AND PROSPEROUS AND AS THE REMOVAL OF ONE SOLICITUDE GENERALLY MAKES WAY FOR ANOTHER EMMA BEING NOW CERTAIN OF HER BALL BEGAN TO ADOPT AS THE NEXT VEXATION MISTER KNIGHTLEY'S PROVOKING INDIFFERENCE ABOUT IT EITHER BECAUSE HE DID NOT DANCE HIMSELF
WHICH YET WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL
DO YOU REALLY THINK IT A BAD THING WHY SO I THINK THEY WILL NEITHER OF THEM DO THE OTHER ANY GOOD
AS RENTING A LARGE FARM OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND RESIDING IN THE PARISH OF DONWELL VERY CREDITABLY SHE BELIEVED SHE KNEW MISTER KNIGHTLEY THOUGHT HIGHLY OF THEM BUT THEY MUST BE COARSE AND UNPOLISHED AND VERY UNFIT
THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON
MISTER WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD AND HIS GOOD NATURE FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER
THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER THE FRIENDS FROM WHOM SHE HAD JUST PARTED THOUGH VERY GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE MUST BE DOING HER HARM THEY WERE A FAMILY OF THE NAME OF MARTIN
THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT I WANTED WELL PRETTY GOOD NEWS IS NOT IT HAVE YOU FINISHED IT HAS EMMA READ IT ALL PUT IT UP PUT IT UP WE WILL HAVE A GOOD TALK ABOUT IT SOME OTHER TIME BUT IT WILL NOT DO NOW
POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY
AND THEREFORE CANNOT ALLOW HERSELF TO FEEL SO MUCH PAIN AS PLEASURE EVERY FRIEND OF MISS TAYLOR MUST BE GLAD TO HAVE HER SO HAPPILY MARRIED
YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER IT WAS VERY LUCKY FOR I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD POOR JAMES THINK HIMSELF SLIGHTED UPON ANY ACCOUNT
SHE HAD MANY ACQUAINTANCE IN THE PLACE FOR HER FATHER WAS UNIVERSALLY CIVIL BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS HER YOUTH HAD PASSED WITHOUT DISTINCTION AND HER MIDDLE OF LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE CARE OF A FAILING MOTHER AND THE ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE A SMALL INCOME GO AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS I PITY YOU I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER FOR DEPEND UPON IT A LUCKY GUESS IS NEVER MERELY LUCK THERE IS ALWAYS SOME TALENT IN IT
JOHN KNIGHTLEY ONLY WAS IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT THAT A MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE SPENT HIS EVENING QUIETLY AT HOME AFTER A DAY OF BUSINESS IN LONDON SHOULD SET OFF AGAIN AND WALK HALF A MILE TO ANOTHER MAN'S HOUSE FOR THE SAKE OF BEING IN MIXED COMPANY TILL BED TIME
AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES HAD IT TAKEN PLACE ONLY ONCE A YEAR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRIEVANCE
THEY WERE THE FIRST ENTITLED AFTER MISSUS WESTON AND EMMA TO BE MADE HAPPY FROM THEM HE WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED TO MISS FAIRFAX BUT SHE WAS SO DEEP IN CONVERSATION WITH JOHN KNIGHTLEY THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO POSITIVE AN INTERRUPTION
ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER
AT THE RISK IN HER OPINION THE GREAT RISK OF ITS BEING ALL IN VAIN ENSCOMBE HOWEVER WAS GRACIOUS GRACIOUS IN FACT IF NOT IN WORD HIS WISH OF STAYING LONGER EVIDENTLY DID NOT PLEASE BUT IT WAS NOT OPPOSED
AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE EMMA IN LOVE AND IN SOME DOUBT OF A RETURN IT WOULD DO HER GOOD BUT THERE IS NOBODY HEREABOUTS TO ATTACH HER AND SHE GOES SO SELDOM FROM HOME THERE DOES INDEED
SHE KNEW IT WOULD BE SO MUCH LESS SO TO HER FATHER THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIM REALLY SUSPECT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE AS HER NOT BEING THOUGHT PERFECT BY EVERY BODY EMMA KNOWS I NEVER FLATTER HER SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE WITH AN ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE OF A SPIRIT WHICH YET WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY
AND TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE WISHES OF HIS OWN FRIENDLY AND SOCIAL DISPOSITION IT WAS NOW SOME TIME SINCE MISS TAYLOR HAD BEGUN TO INFLUENCE HIS SCHEMES BUT AS IT WAS NOT THE TYRANNIC INFLUENCE OF YOUTH ON YOUTH
I SHALL HEAR OF EVERY THING THAT IS GOING ON AMONG YOU I HAVE ENGAGED MISSUS WESTON TO CORRESPOND WITH ME SHE HAS BEEN SO KIND AS TO PROMISE IT OH THE BLESSING OF A FEMALE CORRESPONDENT WHEN ONE IS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE ABSENT SHE WILL TELL ME EVERY THING
BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT IS NOT OVER TRIMMED I HAVE THE GREATEST DISLIKE TO THE IDEA OF BEING OVER TRIMMED QUITE A HORROR OF FINERY I MUST PUT ON A FEW ORNAMENTS NOW BECAUSE IT IS EXPECTED OF ME A BRIDE YOU KNOW MUST APPEAR LIKE A BRIDE
HE THOUGHT PRINCIPALLY OF MISSUS CHURCHILL'S ILLNESS AND WANTED TO KNOW HOW SHE WAS TREATED AND AS FOR THE BALL IT WAS SHOCKING TO HAVE DEAR EMMA DISAPPOINTED BUT THEY WOULD ALL BE SAFER AT HOME EMMA WAS READY FOR HER VISITOR SOME TIME BEFORE HE APPEARED
NOT AT ALL SIR IT IS A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND SO MILD THAT I MUST DRAW BACK FROM YOUR GREAT FIRE BUT YOU MUST HAVE FOUND IT VERY DAMP AND DIRTY I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD
COMPREHENDED MANY SUCH NOT UNFREQUENTLY THROUGH EMMA'S PERSUASION HE HAD SOME OF THE CHOSEN AND THE BEST TO DINE WITH HIM BUT EVENING PARTIES WERE WHAT HE PREFERRED AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY
HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS
BUT MY NATURAL TASTE IS ALL FOR SIMPLICITY A SIMPLE STYLE OF DRESS IS SO INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO FINERY BUT I AM QUITE IN THE MINORITY I BELIEVE FEW PEOPLE SEEM TO VALUE SIMPLICITY OF DRESS SHOW AND FINERY ARE EVERY THING
MISSUS WESTON OUGHT TO HAVE FOUND MORE IN IT FOR SHE HAD A HUSBAND WHOSE WARM HEART AND SWEET TEMPER MADE HIM THINK EVERY THING DUE TO HER IN RETURN FOR THE GREAT GOODNESS OF BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM BUT THOUGH SHE HAD ONE SORT OF SPIRIT
MISSUS BATES THE WIDOW OF A FORMER VICAR OF HIGHBURY WAS A VERY OLD LADY ALMOST PAST EVERY THING BUT TEA AND QUADRILLE SHE LIVED WITH HER SINGLE DAUGHTER IN A VERY SMALL WAY
AND EVERY EXPRESSION OF CONGRATULATION WHICH HER MARRIAGE HAD ALREADY SECURED SHE FELT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE WOMAN AND SHE HAD LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW FORTUNATE SHE MIGHT WELL BE THOUGHT
I AM SURE YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT ME UNFIT FOR THE OFFICE I HELD YES SAID HE SMILING YOU ARE BETTER PLACED HERE
SHE ALWAYS DECLARES SHE WILL NEVER MARRY WHICH OF COURSE MEANS JUST NOTHING AT ALL BUT I HAVE NO IDEA THAT SHE HAS YET EVER SEEN A MAN SHE CARED FOR IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD THING FOR HER TO BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH A PROPER OBJECT
AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER HE COULD NOT MEET HER IN CONVERSATION
WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
AND HAD SENSE AND ENERGY AND SPIRITS THAT MIGHT BE HOPED WOULD BEAR HER WELL AND HAPPILY THROUGH ITS LITTLE DIFFICULTIES AND PRIVATIONS AND THEN THERE WAS SUCH COMFORT IN THE VERY EASY DISTANCE OF RANDALLS FROM HARTFIELD
BUT ON SUCCEEDING EARLY IN LIFE TO A SMALL INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME INDISPOSED FOR ANY OF THE MORE HOMELY PURSUITS IN WHICH HIS BROTHERS WERE ENGAGED AND HAD SATISFIED AN ACTIVE CHEERFUL MIND
THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS LETTER WAS FORWARDED TO EMMA IN A NOTE FROM MISSUS WESTON INSTANTLY AS TO HIS GOING IT WAS INEVITABLE HE MUST BE GONE WITHIN A FEW HOURS THOUGH WITHOUT FEELING ANY REAL ALARM FOR HIS AUNT TO LESSEN HIS REPUGNANCE HE KNEW HER ILLNESSES
AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING
EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO THAT MISS TAYLOR AND I MET WITH HIM IN BROADWAY LANE WHEN BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO DRIZZLE HE DARTED AWAY WITH SO MUCH GALLANTRY AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF DEPENDENCE OR INDEPENDENCE AT ANY RATE IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE SAID EMMA PLAYFULLY
AND MISS CHURCHILL FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM NOBODY WAS SURPRIZED EXCEPT HER BROTHER AND HIS WIFE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN HIM AND WHO WERE FULL OF PRIDE AND IMPORTANCE WHICH THE CONNEXION WOULD OFFEND
SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT
AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO
FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF
HIS CARE FOR THEIR HEALTH MADE HIM GRIEVE THAT THEY WOULD EAT SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND
BUT IT WAS NOT IN MISTER WESTON'S NATURE TO IMAGINE THAT ANY CAPRICE COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO AFFECT ONE SO DEAR AND AS HE BELIEVED SO DESERVEDLY DEAR HE SAW HIS SON EVERY YEAR IN LONDON AND WAS PROUD OF HIM
BUT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AS I HAVE YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY CANDIDATES THERE ALWAYS ARE FOR THE FIRST SITUATIONS I SAW A VAST DEAL OF THAT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ROUND MAPLE GROVE A COUSIN OF MISTER SUCKLING MISSUS BRAGGE
BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER
THAT THE PROSPECT OF THE INTRODUCTION HAD GIVEN AS MUCH PANIC AS PLEASURE BUT THE HUMBLE GRATEFUL LITTLE GIRL WENT OFF WITH HIGHLY GRATIFIED FEELINGS
AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY NOT UNWILLING TO TALK
SEEM AS LITTLE TO TEMPT HER TO BREAK HER RESOLUTION AT PRESENT SAID MISSUS WESTON AS CAN WELL BE AND WHILE SHE IS SO HAPPY AT HARTFIELD I CANNOT WISH HER TO BE FORMING ANY ATTACHMENT WHICH WOULD BE CREATING SUCH DIFFICULTIES ON POOR MISTER WOODHOUSE'S ACCOUNT
QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING
AND HAD LIVED NEARLY TWENTY ONE YEARS IN THE WORLD WITH VERY LITTLE TO DISTRESS OR VEX HER SHE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE TWO DAUGHTERS OF A MOST AFFECTIONATE INDULGENT FATHER AND HAD IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER SISTER'S MARRIAGE
SERLE UNDERSTANDS BOILING AN EGG BETTER THAN ANY BODY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU MISS BATES
SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT
MAY COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED AH MY DEAR I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS FOR WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS
THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT
I HAVE SOME NOTION OF PUTTING SUCH A TRIMMING AS THIS TO MY WHITE AND SILVER POPLIN DO YOU THINK IT WILL LOOK WELL THE WHOLE PARTY WERE BUT JUST REASSEMBLED IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHEN MISTER WESTON MADE HIS APPEARANCE AMONG THEM
WHICH EXACTLY SUITED MISTER WOODHOUSE FULL OF TRIVIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND HARMLESS GOSSIP MISSUS GODDARD WAS THE MISTRESS OF A SCHOOL NOT OF A SEMINARY OR AN ESTABLISHMENT OR ANY THING WHICH PROFESSED
SUCH A FORTNIGHT AS IT HAS BEEN HE CONTINUED
BUT AS TO THE GREATER MISERY OF THE VICTIMS I DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT LIES BUT I ONLY MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE ARE ADVERTISING OFFICES AND THAT BY APPLYING TO THEM I SHOULD HAVE NO DOUBT OF VERY SOON MEETING WITH SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO REPEATED MISSUS ELTON
AND WHEN ROUSING HIMSELF IT WAS ONLY TO SAY OF ALL HORRID THINGS LEAVE TAKING IS THE WORST BUT YOU WILL COME AGAIN SAID EMMA THIS WILL NOT BE YOUR ONLY VISIT TO RANDALLS AH SHAKING HIS HEAD
AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED
I CERTAINLY MUST SAID SHE THIS SENSATION OF LISTLESSNESS WEARINESS STUPIDITY THIS DISINCLINATION TO SIT DOWN AND EMPLOY MYSELF
DIRTY SIR LOOK AT MY SHOES NOT A SPECK ON THEM WELL THAT IS QUITE SURPRISING FOR WE HAVE HAD A VAST DEAL OF RAIN HERE IT RAINED DREADFULLY HARD FOR HALF AN HOUR WHILE WE WERE AT BREAKFAST I WANTED THEM TO PUT OFF THE WEDDING
MUST STILL SEE HEAR AND REMEMBER EMMA IS SPOILED BY BEING THE CLEVEREST OF HER FAMILY AT TEN YEARS OLD SHE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHICH PUZZLED HER SISTER AT SEVENTEEN SHE WAS ALWAYS QUICK AND ASSURED
BETWEEN THEM IT WAS MORE THE INTIMACY OF SISTERS EVEN BEFORE MISS TAYLOR HAD CEASED TO HOLD THE NOMINAL OFFICE OF GOVERNESS
I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF EMMA'S DOCTRINES GIVE ANY STRENGTH OF MIND OR TEND AT ALL TO MAKE A GIRL ADAPT HERSELF RATIONALLY
AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN A HOUSE OF HER OWN BUT WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSE OF HER OWN THIS IS THREE TIMES AS LARGE AND YOU HAVE NEVER ANY ODD HUMOURS MY DEAR
AND BE ATTACKED BY NO REGRETS BUT HER OWN THE BACKGAMMON TABLE WAS PLACED BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WALKED IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY MISTER KNIGHTLEY A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT AND THIRTY
AND WAS CONSIDERED WITH ALL THE REGARD AND RESPECT WHICH A HARMLESS OLD LADY UNDER SUCH UNTOWARD CIRCUMSTANCES CAN EXCITE HER DAUGHTER ENJOYED A MOST UNCOMMON DEGREE OF POPULARITY FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED
AND SOON MOVED AWAY TO MAKE THE REST OF HIS FRIENDS HAPPY BY A PARTIAL COMMUNICATION OF WHAT THE WHOLE ROOM MUST HAVE OVERHEARD ALREADY IT WAS WELL THAT HE TOOK EVERY BODY'S JOY FOR GRANTED OR HE MIGHT NOT HAVE THOUGHT EITHER MISTER WOODHOUSE OR MISTER KNIGHTLEY PARTICULARLY DELIGHTED
WHO HAD BEEN IN MORE THAN ONE CROWD AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALONE SUCH A MAN TO QUIT THE TRANQUILLITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS OWN FIRESIDE AND ON THE EVENING OF A COLD SLEETY APRIL DAY RUSH OUT AGAIN INTO THE WORLD
I SHOULD SUFFER MORE FROM COMPARISON A GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY IS ALL THAT I SHOULD CONDITION FOR I KNOW YOU I KNOW YOU YOU WOULD TAKE UP WITH ANY THING BUT I SHALL BE A LITTLE MORE NICE AND I AM SURE THE GOOD CAMPBELLS WILL BE QUITE ON MY SIDE
FOR MISS SMITH WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHOM EMMA KNEW VERY WELL BY SIGHT AND HAD LONG FELT AN INTEREST IN ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEAUTY A VERY GRACIOUS INVITATION WAS RETURNED AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION
IN HER LETTERS I SHALL BE AT DEAR HIGHBURY AGAIN A VERY FRIENDLY SHAKE OF THE HAND A VERY EARNEST GOOD BYE CLOSED THE SPEECH AND THE DOOR HAD SOON SHUT OUT FRANK CHURCHILL SHORT HAD BEEN THE NOTICE SHORT THEIR MEETING HE WAS GONE
FACE AND FIGURE I
BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY
AH POOR MISS TAYLOR TIS A SAD BUSINESS POOR MISTER AND MISS WOODHOUSE IF YOU PLEASE BUT I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY POOR MISS TAYLOR I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND EMMA
AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
WHICH THOUGH PRINCIPALLY ADDRESSED TO MISSUS WESTON HE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST DOUBT OF BEING HIGHLY INTERESTING TO EVERY BODY IN THE ROOM HE GAVE HER A LETTER IT WAS FROM FRANK AND TO HERSELF HE HAD MET WITH IT IN HIS WAY AND HAD TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF OPENING IT
I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST AH POOR MISS TAYLOR TIS A SAD BUSINESS
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL HAS WRITTEN TO MISSUS WESTON
AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS
YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER HE COULD COMMAND THE VISITS OF HIS OWN LITTLE CIRCLE IN A GREAT MEASURE AS HE LIKED HE HAD NOT MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE HIS HORROR OF LATE HOURS AND LARGE DINNER PARTIES
AND PERHAPS NO MAN CAN BE A GOOD JUDGE OF THE COMFORT A WOMAN FEELS IN THE SOCIETY OF ONE OF HER OWN SEX AFTER BEING USED TO IT ALL HER LIFE I CAN IMAGINE YOUR OBJECTION TO HARRIET SMITH SHE IS NOT THE SUPERIOR YOUNG WOMAN WHICH EMMA'S FRIEND OUGHT TO BE
AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO
HATING CHANGE OF EVERY KIND MATRIMONY AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING
SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES
BUT MY DEAR CHILD THE TIME IS DRAWING NEAR HERE IS APRIL AND JUNE OR SAY EVEN JULY IS VERY NEAR WITH SUCH BUSINESS TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE US YOUR INEXPERIENCE REALLY AMUSES ME
WELL INFORMED USEFUL GENTLE KNOWING ALL THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY INTERESTED IN ALL ITS CONCERNS AND PECULIARLY INTERESTED IN HERSELF IN EVERY PLEASURE EVERY SCHEME OF HERS
BUT SUPPOSING ANY LITTLE INCONVENIENCE MAY BE APPREHENDED FROM THE INTIMACY IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT EMMA ACCOUNTABLE TO NOBODY BUT HER FATHER WHO PERFECTLY APPROVES THE ACQUAINTANCE SHOULD PUT AN END TO IT SO LONG AS IT IS A SOURCE OF PLEASURE TO HERSELF
AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY
AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE
SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES IN TALKING AND LISTENING AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN BETWEENS THAT THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE AND THE SUPPER TABLE WHICH
WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL AND HELP AND RECOMMEND THE MINCED CHICKEN AND SCALLOPED OYSTERS
YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE WEDDING AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU FOR WE ALL BEHAVED CHARMINGLY EVERY BODY WAS PUNCTUAL EVERY BODY IN THEIR BEST LOOKS NOT A TEAR AND HARDLY A LONG FACE TO BE SEEN
COLONEL AND MISSUS CAMPBELL ARE TO BE IN TOWN AGAIN BY MIDSUMMER SAID JANE I MUST SPEND SOME TIME WITH THEM I AM SURE THEY WILL WANT IT AFTERWARDS I MAY PROBABLY BE GLAD TO DISPOSE OF MYSELF BUT I WOULD NOT WISH YOU TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF MAKING ANY INQUIRIES AT PRESENT
IN LONG SENTENCES OF REFINED NONSENSE TO COMBINE LIBERAL ACQUIREMENTS WITH ELEGANT MORALITY UPON NEW PRINCIPLES AND NEW SYSTEMS AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY
AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS AND HOPED BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY THROUGH THE EVENING AND BE ATTACKED BY NO REGRETS BUT HER OWN
IT GREW BLANKER THE MORE I TURNED THE PROSPECT OVER AT LAST IN THE DESPERATION OF MY POSITION MY MIND TURNED TO THE ANIMAL MEN I HAD ENCOUNTERED I TRIED TO FIND SOME HOPE IN WHAT I REMEMBERED OF THEM
WADING UP THE CREEK AND PRESENTLY FINDING MYSELF KNEEDEEP IN A LITTLE STREAM I SCRAMBLED OUT AT LAST ON THE WESTWARD BANK AND WITH MY HEART BEATING LOUDLY IN MY EARS CREPT INTO A TANGLE OF FERNS TO AWAIT THE ISSUE I HEARD THE DOG
I DID NOT TURN MY HEAD TO FOLLOW HER AT FIRST I COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE WHAT HAD HAPPENED I CROUCHED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DINGEY STUNNED AND STARING BLANKLY AT THE VACANT OILY SEA THEN I REALISED THAT I WAS IN THAT LITTLE HELL OF MINE AGAIN NOW HALF SWAMPED
AND THERE WERE SPOTS OF BLOOD ON THE GUNWALE AT THE SAME TIME MY EYE CAUGHT MY HAND SO THIN THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A DIRTY SKIN PURSE FULL OF LOOSE BONES AND ALL THE BUSINESS OF THE BOAT CAME BACK TO ME
THE WHITE HAIRED MAN I FOUND WAS STILL REGARDING ME STEADFASTLY
THERE WAS A SILENCE THEN A CRASHING AMONG THE INTERLACING VEGETATION FIRST HERE THEN THERE AND THEN HALF A DOZEN FACES APPEARED STRANGE FACES LIT BY A STRANGE LIGHT
IF I WERE YOU HE HE HESITATED AND SEEMED TO ALTER HIS MIND ABOUT WHAT WAS ON HIS LIPS I WISH YOU'D HELP ME WITH THESE RABBITS HE SAID HIS PROCEDURE WITH THE RABBITS WAS SINGULAR I WADED IN WITH HIM AND HELPED HIM LUG ONE OF THE HUTCHES ASHORE
BUT THEY DO NOT HELP THE TELLING OF THE STORY
AS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS SECRECY AND BY SOME ODD LEAP IN MY THOUGHTS THE POINTED EARS AND LUMINOUS EYES OF MONTGOMERY'S ATTENDANT CAME BACK AGAIN BEFORE ME WITH THE SHARPEST DEFINITION I STARED BEFORE ME OUT AT THE GREEN SEA FROTHING UNDER A FRESHENING BREEZE
A HEAVY FACELESS THING WITH STRANGE RED EYES LOOKING AT US CURIOUSLY FROM AMIDST THE GREEN FOR A SPACE NO ONE SPOKE THEN MONTGOMERY HICCOUGHED WHO SAID HE WAS DEAD
HE IS DEAD SAID THIS MONSTER THEY SAW THERE WAS NOTHING THREATENING ABOUT THIS DETACHMENT AT ANY RATE
YET SOME OF HIS EXPERIMENTS BY THE JOURNALIST'S ACCOUNT WERE WANTONLY CRUEL HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE PURCHASED HIS SOCIAL PEACE BY ABANDONING HIS INVESTIGATIONS BUT HE APPARENTLY PREFERRED THE LATTER AS MOST MEN WOULD WHO HAVE ONCE FALLEN UNDER THE OVERMASTERING SPELL OF RESEARCH
AND THEN THE CAPTAIN THE MATE AND ONE OF THE SEAMEN HELPING HIM RAN ME AFT TOWARDS THE STERN THE DINGEY OF THE LADY VAIN HAD BEEN TOWING BEHIND IT WAS HALF FULL OF WATER HAD NO OARS AND WAS QUITE UNVICTUALLED
AND THEN FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER TURNED AWAY FROM MY DIRECT STARE AND LOOKED AT ME IN AN ODD FURTIVE MANNER
MONTGOMERY STEERED US ROUND AND INTO A NARROW LITTLE DOCK EXCAVATED IN THE BEACH THEN THE MAN ON THE BEACH HASTENED TOWARDS US THIS DOCK AS I CALL IT WAS REALLY A MERE DITCH JUST LONG ENOUGH AT THIS PHASE OF THE TIDE TO TAKE THE LONGBOAT
THE WHITE HAIRED MAN STOOD HOLDING IN A TUMULT OF SIX DOGS AND BAWLING ORDERS OVER THEIR DIN MONTGOMERY HAVING UNSHIPPED THE RUDDER LANDED LIKEWISE AND ALL SET TO WORK AT UNLOADING
ON CARRY HIM FAR THEY WENT IN UP TO THEIR ARMPITS AND STOOD REGARDING ME LET GO SAID I AND THE BODY OF MONTGOMERY VANISHED WITH A SPLASH SOMETHING SEEMED TO TIGHTEN ACROSS MY CHEST GOOD SAID I WITH A BREAK IN MY VOICE
I HEARD THE BOWS GROUND IN THE SAND STAVED THE DINGEY OFF THE RUDDER OF THE BIG BOAT WITH MY PIGGIN AND FREEING THE PAINTER LANDED THE THREE MUFFLED MEN WITH THE CLUMSIEST MOVEMENTS SCRAMBLED OUT UPON THE SAND AND FORTHWITH SET TO LANDING THE CARGO
AND THE DWINDLING SHREDS OF THE HUMANITY STILL STARTLED ME EVERY NOW AND THEN A MOMENTARY RECRUDESCENCE OF SPEECH PERHAPS AN UNEXPECTED DEXTERITY OF THE FORE FEET A PITIFUL ATTEMPT TO WALK ERECT I TOO MUST HAVE UNDERGONE STRANGE CHANGES
AND A SMALL UNGLAZED WINDOW DEFENDED BY AN IRON BAR LOOKED OUT TOWARDS THE SEA THIS THE WHITE HAIRED MAN TOLD ME WAS TO BE MY APARTMENT AND THE INNER DOOR WHICH FOR FEAR OF ACCIDENTS HE SAID HE WOULD LOCK ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS MY LIMIT INWARD
IS HE DEAD INDEED IS THERE A LAW REPEATED THE MAN IN WHITE IS THERE A LAW THOU OTHER WITH THE WHIP HE IS DEAD SAID THE HAIRY GREY THING AND THEY ALL STOOD WATCHING US
IF IT WAS AN ACCIDENT HIS GRUESOME PAMPHLET BECAME NOTORIOUS ON THE DAY OF ITS PUBLICATION A WRETCHED DOG FLAYED AND OTHERWISE MUTILATED ESCAPED FROM MOREAU'S HOUSE IT WAS IN THE SILLY SEASON AND A PROMINENT EDITOR A COUSIN OF THE TEMPORARY LABORATORY ASSISTANT
I SAW ITS FEATURES VANISH IN A FLASH ITS FACE WAS DRIVEN IN YET IT PASSED ME GRIPPED MONTGOMERY AND HOLDING HIM FELL HEADLONG BESIDE HIM AND PULLED HIM SPRAWLING UPON ITSELF IN ITS DEATH AGONY I FOUND MYSELF ALONE WITH M'LING THE DEAD BRUTE AND THE PROSTRATE MAN
TOWARDS NOON CERTAIN OF THEM CAME AND SQUATTED BASKING IN THE HOT SAND THE IMPERIOUS VOICES OF HUNGER AND THIRST PREVAILED OVER MY DREAD I CAME OUT OF THE BUSHES AND REVOLVER IN HAND WALKED DOWN TOWARDS THESE SEATED FIGURES ONE A WOLF WOMAN TURNED HER HEAD AND STARED AT ME
BUT MY HEART FAILED ME I WENT BACK TO THE BEACH AND TURNING EASTWARD PAST THE BURNING ENCLOSURE MADE FOR A POINT WHERE A SHALLOW SPIT OF CORAL SAND RAN OUT TOWARDS THE REEF HERE I COULD SIT DOWN AND THINK
AMONG THE CHIPS SCATTERED ABOUT THE BEACH LAY THE TWO AXES THAT HAD BEEN USED TO CHOP UP THE BOATS THE TIDE WAS CREEPING IN BEHIND ME THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT COURAGE I LOOKED SQUARELY INTO THE FACES OF THE ADVANCING MONSTERS
I THINK I SAID I FELT ALL RIGHT
THESE CREATURES I HAD SEEN WERE THE VICTIMS OF SOME HIDEOUS EXPERIMENT THESE SICKENING SCOUNDRELS HAD MERELY INTENDED TO KEEP ME BACK TO FOOL ME WITH THEIR DISPLAY OF CONFIDENCE AND PRESENTLY TO FALL UPON ME WITH A FATE MORE HORRIBLE THAN DEATH
AFTER THE BLINDING SUNLIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE SULPHUROUS GROUND
FOR THERE WAS NO ROOM ABOARD I HAD RECOVERED FROM MY HYSTERICAL PHASE BY THIS TIME AND ANSWERED HIS HAIL AS HE APPROACHED BRAVELY ENOUGH
AT FIRST I DID NOT UNDERSTAND BUT PRESENTLY IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT HE WISHED ME TO FOLLOW HIM AND THIS I DID AT LAST SLOWLY FOR THE DAY WAS HOT WHEN WE REACHED THE TREES HE CLAMBERED INTO THEM FOR HE COULD TRAVEL BETTER AMONG THEIR SWINGING CREEPERS THAN ON THE GROUND
THEN SUDDENLY HIS CAREER WAS CLOSED HE HAD TO LEAVE ENGLAND A JOURNALIST OBTAINED ACCESS TO HIS LABORATORY IN THE CAPACITY OF LABORATORY ASSISTANT
TAKE TO THE RIGGING AND SLOWLY BUT SURELY SHE CAME ROUND TO THE WIND THE SAILS FLUTTERED AND THEN BELLIED OUT AS THE WIND CAME INTO THEM I STARED AT HER WEATHER BEATEN SIDE HEELING STEEPLY TOWARDS ME AND THEN SHE PASSED OUT OF MY RANGE OF VIEW
OR TO FORCE MYSELF UPON MONTGOMERY AND HIS COMPANION SO I WAITED PASSIVELY UPON FATE
HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND FORTHWITH THEY WENT OFF WITH THAT HOPPING RUN OF THEIRS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK UP THE BEACH INCREASE AND MULTIPLY MY FRIENDS SAID MONTGOMERY REPLENISH THE ISLAND HITHERTO WE'VE HAD A CERTAIN LACK OF MEAT HERE
IT JUMPED UPON ME SUDDENLY CLOSE TO MY FACE THE MAN HAD POINTED EARS
PLAINLY BUT NOT UNCOMFORTABLY FURNISHED AND WITH ITS INNER DOOR WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY AJAR OPENING INTO A PAVED COURTYARD THIS INNER DOOR MONTGOMERY AT ONCE CLOSED A HAMMOCK WAS SLUNG ACROSS THE DARKER CORNER OF THE ROOM
DROWSILY AND LOOKING AWAY FROM ME I PASSED THEM AND WENT DOWN INTO THE SHADOW AND ODOURS OF THE ALMOST DESERTED RAVINE IN AN EMPTY HUT I FEASTED ON SOME SPECKED AND HALF DECAYED FRUIT AND THEN AFTER I HAD PROPPED SOME BRANCHES AND STICKS ABOUT THE OPENING
I ALWAYS HAD A BONFIRE READY BUT NO DOUBT THE VOLCANIC REPUTATION OF THE ISLAND WAS TAKEN TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER THAT I BEGAN TO THINK OF MAKING A RAFT BY THAT TIME MY ARM HAD HEALED AND BOTH MY HANDS WERE AT MY SERVICE AGAIN
AND FOUND MONTGOMERY WITHIN A YARD OF IT HE MEANT TO LOCK THE OUTER DOOR I RAISED THIS NAILED STICK OF MINE AND CUT AT HIS FACE BUT HE SPRANG BACK I HESITATED A MOMENT THEN TURNED AND FLED ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
AND THE ONLY SOUND NEAR ME WAS THE THIN HUM OF SOME SMALL GNATS THAT HAD DISCOVERED ME PRESENTLY I BECAME AWARE OF A DROWSY BREATHING SOUND
I EVEN BAWLED ENTREATIES TO THE SAILORS MONTGOMERY SAID NEVER A WORD ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD YOU'RE GOING OVERBOARD I TELL YOU WAS THE CAPTAIN'S REFRAIN LAW BE DAMNED I'M KING HERE
I TURNED ONCE MORE ALMOST PASSIONATELY NOW TO HAMMERING TOGETHER STAKES AND BRANCHES TO FORM A RAFT FOR MY ESCAPE I FOUND A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES I AM AN EXTREMELY UNHANDY MAN
IMMEDIATELY AFTER APPEARED A MONSTER IN HEADLONG PURSUIT BLOOD BEDABBLED
SO THAT I PREFER TO MAKE NO CHRONICLE FOR THAT GAP OF TIME TO TELL ONLY ONE CARDINAL INCIDENT OF THE TEN MONTHS I SPENT AS AN INTIMATE OF THESE HALF HUMANISED BRUTES THERE IS MUCH THAT STICKS IN MY MEMORY THAT I COULD WRITE THINGS THAT I WOULD CHEERFULLY GIVE MY RIGHT HAND TO FORGET
WHERE SAID I IT'S AN ISLAND WHERE I LIVE SO FAR AS I KNOW IT HASN'T GOT A NAME HE STARED AT ME WITH HIS NETHER LIP DROPPING AND LOOKED SO WILFULLY STUPID OF A SUDDEN
SAID HE STUPIDLY AND THEN WITH A LIGHT COMING INTO HIS EYES WHY IT'S MISTER MISTER PRENDICK SAID I PRENDICK BE DAMNED SAID HE SHUT UP THAT'S YOUR NAME MISTER SHUT UP
AND THE VOICE OF A HUMAN BEING TOGETHER THEN ANOTHER VOICE TELLING SOME HEAVEN FORSAKEN IDIOT TO DESIST YOU WERE NEARLY DEAD SAID MY INTERLOCUTOR
I RECALLED THAT NONE OF THESE MEN HAD SPOKEN TO ME THOUGH MOST OF THEM I HAD FOUND LOOKING AT ME AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER IN A PECULIARLY FURTIVE MANNER QUITE UNLIKE THE FRANK STARE OF YOUR UNSOPHISTICATED SAVAGE INDEED THEY HAD ALL SEEMED REMARKABLY TACITURN
FROM A ROPE OF CREEPERS THAT LOOPED DOWN FROM THE FOLIAGE OVERHEAD HIS BACK WAS TO ME HULLO SAID I HE CAME DOWN WITH A TWISTING JUMP AND STOOD FACING ME I SAY SAID I
THEN AS I HANDLED THE BOOKS ON THE SHELF IT CAME UP IN CONSCIOUSNESS WHERE HAD I HEARD THE NAME OF MOREAU BEFORE I SAT DOWN BEFORE THE WINDOW TOOK OUT THE BISCUITS THAT STILL REMAINED TO ME AND ATE THEM WITH AN EXCELLENT APPETITE MOREAU
ABRUPTLY THE CRUELTY OF THIS DESERTION BECAME CLEAR TO ME I HAD NO MEANS OF REACHING THE LAND UNLESS I SHOULD CHANCE TO DRIFT THERE
HE'S CAPTAIN TOO NAMED DAVIES
HE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO A CONVENIENT DECK CHAIR BEFORE THE WINDOW AND TO AN ARRAY OF OLD BOOKS CHIEFLY I FOUND SURGICAL WORKS AND EDITIONS OF THE LATIN AND GREEK CLASSICS LANGUAGES I CANNOT READ WITH ANY COMFORT ON A SHELF NEAR THE HAMMOCK
THAT MOREAU HAD BEEN VIVISECTING A HUMAN BEING ALL THE TIME SINCE I HAD HEARD HIS NAME I HAD BEEN TRYING TO LINK IN MY MIND IN SOME WAY THE GROTESQUE ANIMALISM OF THE ISLANDERS WITH HIS ABOMINATIONS AND NOW I THOUGHT I SAW IT ALL
THAT DANGER AT LEAST WAS OVER BUT THIS I KNEW WAS ONLY THE FIRST OF THE SERIES OF RELAPSES THAT MUST COME I BURNT BOTH OF THE BODIES ON A PYRE OF BRUSHWOOD BUT AFTER THAT I SAW THAT UNLESS I LEFT THE ISLAND MY DEATH WAS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME
BUT WITH A CERTAIN LACK OF PRACTICAL SENSE WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY BANE I HAD MADE IT A MILE OR MORE FROM THE SEA AND BEFORE I HAD DRAGGED IT DOWN TO THE BEACH THE THING HAD FALLEN TO PIECES PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL THAT I WAS SAVED FROM LAUNCHING IT
I HEARD A LIGHT FOOTFALL BEHIND ME AND TURNING QUICKLY SAW THE BIG HYENA SWINE PERHAPS A DOZEN YARDS AWAY HIS HEAD WAS BENT DOWN HIS BRIGHT EYES WERE FIXED UPON ME HIS STUMPY HANDS CLENCHED AND HELD CLOSE BY HIS SIDE
THOUGH WHEN THERE'S MUCH OF A SEA WITHOUT ANY WIND
HE IS NOT DEAD SAID I IN A LOUD VOICE EVEN NOW HE WATCHES US THIS STARTLED THEM TWENTY PAIRS OF EYES REGARDED ME THE HOUSE OF PAIN IS GONE SAID I IT WILL COME AGAIN
HOW THE HAIR BEGAN TO SPREAD OVER THE EXPOSED LIMBS HOW THEIR FOREHEADS FELL AWAY AND THEIR FACES PROJECTED HOW THE QUASI HUMAN INTIMACY I HAD PERMITTED MYSELF WITH SOME OF THEM IN THE FIRST MONTH OF MY LONELINESS BECAME A SHUDDERING HORROR TO RECALL THE CHANGE WAS SLOW AND INEVITABLE
CAN'T HAVE YOU SAID MONTGOMERY'S COMPANION CONCISELY YOU CAN'T HAVE ME SAID I AGHAST HE HAD THE SQUAREST AND MOST RESOLUTE FACE I EVER SET EYES UPON
EVERY NOW AND THEN HE LOOKED BACK AT ME OVER HIS SHOULDER HE WENT SLANTING ALONG THE BEACH AND VANISHED BENEATH THE DRIVING MASSES OF DENSE SMOKE THAT WERE STILL POURING OUT FROM THE BURNING ENCLOSURE FOR SOME TIME I STOOD STARING AFTER HIM
AND THEY CAME BACK HURRYING AND FEARFUL TO THE MARGIN OF THE WATER LEAVING LONG WAKES OF BLACK IN THE SILVER AT THE WATER'S EDGE THEY STOPPED TURNING AND GLARING INTO THE SEA AS THOUGH THEY PRESENTLY EXPECTED MONTGOMERY TO ARISE THEREFROM AND EXACT VENGEANCE
MONTGOMERY RAISED HIMSELF SLOWLY AND STARED IN A MUDDLED WAY AT THE SHATTERED BEAST MAN BESIDE HIM IT MORE THAN HALF SOBERED HIM HE SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET THEN I SAW THE GREY THING RETURNING CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE TREES SEE SAID I POINTING TO THE DEAD BRUTE
TWICE WE HEARD UNSEEN CREATURES HOWLING AND SHRIEKING PAST OUR LITTLE BAND AND ONCE THE LITTLE PINK SLOTH CREATURE APPEARED AND STARED AT US AND VANISHED AGAIN BUT WE WERE NOT ATTACKED AGAIN AT THE GATES OF THE ENCLOSURE OUR COMPANY OF BEAST PEOPLE LEFT US M'LING GOING WITH THE REST
I MASTER WHO ARE YOU THEY SAY THERE IS NO MASTER NOW BUT I KNOW I KNOW
THE MATTER SOUNDED AS THOUGH IT ENDED IN BLOWS BUT IN THAT I THOUGHT MY EARS WERE MISTAKEN THEN HE SHOUTED AT THE DOGS AND RETURNED TO THE CABIN WELL SAID HE IN THE DOORWAY YOU WERE JUST BEGINNING TO TELL ME
HE HAD WATERY GREY EYES ODDLY VOID OF EXPRESSION THEN JUST OVERHEAD
AND IRREGULARLY SET WITH TREES AND UNDERGROWTH HALF WAY UP WAS A SQUARE ENCLOSURE OF SOME GREYISH STONE WHICH I FOUND SUBSEQUENTLY WAS BUILT PARTLY OF CORAL AND PARTLY OF PUMICEOUS LAVA TWO THATCHED ROOFS PEEPED FROM WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE
SAID HE WAS DEAD BUT MONTGOMERY WAS STILL SOBER ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND MY MOTIVE IN DENYING MOREAU'S DEATH HE IS NOT DEAD HE SAID SLOWLY NOT DEAD AT ALL NO MORE DEAD THAN I AM SOME
I WENT NORTHEASTWARD IN A DIRECTION AT RIGHT ANGLES TO MY PREVIOUS EXPEDITION ONCE AS I WENT RUNNING HEADLONG UP THE BEACH I GLANCED OVER MY SHOULDER AND SAW HIS ATTENDANT WITH HIM I RAN FURIOUSLY UP THE SLOPE OVER IT
I ADVANCED A STEP FARTHER STOPPED AND PULLED OUT MY REVOLVER AT LAST I HAD HIM FACE TO FACE THE BRUTE MADE NO SIGN OF RETREAT BUT ITS EARS WENT BACK ITS HAIR BRISTLED AND ITS BODY CROUCHED TOGETHER I AIMED BETWEEN THE EYES AND FIRED
THAT WAY MISTER BLASTED SHUT UP THAT'S WHAT I MEAN OVERBOARD MISTER SHUT UP AND SHARP WE'RE CLEANING THE SHIP OUT
AND THIS TIME I TOOK CARE OF THE STRENGTH THE ONLY INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE WAS THAT I HAD NO VESSEL TO CONTAIN THE WATER I SHOULD NEED IF I FLOATED FORTH UPON THESE UNTRAVELLED SEAS I WOULD HAVE EVEN TRIED POTTERY BUT THE ISLAND CONTAINED NO CLAY
ON ROLLERS TOWARDS THE WALLED YARD I AND MONTGOMERY AT LEAST HE ADDED THEN WHEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET AWAY I CAN'T SAY WE'RE OFF THE TRACK TO ANYWHERE
I FELT ALL THE WRETCHEDER FOR THE LACK OF A BREAKFAST HUNGER AND A LACK OF BLOOD CORPUSCLES TAKE ALL THE MANHOOD FROM A MAN I PERCEIVED PRETTY CLEARLY THAT I HAD NOT THE STAMINA EITHER TO RESIST WHAT THE CAPTAIN CHOSE TO DO TO EXPEL ME
THAT WAY MISTER BLASTED SHUT UP THAT WAY ROARED THE CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY AND HIS COMPANION TURNED AS HE SPOKE
HE HAD LONG SINCE LOST SPEECH AND ACTIVE MOVEMENT AND THE LANK HAIR OF THE LITTLE BRUTE GREW THICKER EVERY DAY AND HIS STUMPY CLAWS MORE ASKEW
A PROMINENT AND MASTERFUL PHYSIOLOGIST WELL KNOWN IN SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY IMAGINATION AND HIS BRUTAL DIRECTNESS IN DISCUSSION WAS THIS THE SAME MOREAU HE HAD PUBLISHED SOME VERY ASTONISHING FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD
FIND SOME HANDLE IN THEIR MINDS TO TAKE HOLD OF
HE HAS CHANGED HIS SHAPE HE HAS CHANGED HIS BODY I WENT ON FOR A TIME YOU WILL NOT SEE HIM HE IS THERE I POINTED UPWARD WHERE HE CAN WATCH YOU YOU CANNOT SEE HIM BUT HE CAN SEE YOU FEAR THE LAW
AND WHEN THEY DID SPEAK ENDOWED WITH VERY UNCANNY VOICES WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM THEN I RECALLED THE EYES OF MONTGOMERY'S UNGAINLY ATTENDANT JUST AS I WAS THINKING OF HIM HE CAME IN HE WAS NOW DRESSED IN WHITE AND CARRIED A LITTLE TRAY WITH SOME COFFEE AND BOILED VEGETABLES THEREON
OF SOME PERPLEXITY WHEN MY EYES MET HIS HE LOOKED DOWN AT THE STAGHOUND THAT SAT BETWEEN HIS KNEES HE WAS A POWERFULLY BUILT MAN AS I HAVE SAID WITH A FINE FOREHEAD AND RATHER HEAVY FEATURES
THE LOCKED DOOR THE READER WILL PERHAPS UNDERSTAND THAT AT FIRST EVERYTHING WAS SO STRANGE ABOUT ME AND MY POSITION WAS THE OUTCOME OF SUCH UNEXPECTED ADVENTURES THAT I HAD NO DISCERNMENT OF THE RELATIVE STRANGENESS OF THIS OR THAT THING
ONCE I TRIED TO INDUCE THE BEAST FOLK TO HUNT HIM BUT I LACKED THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THEM CO OPERATE FOR ONE END AGAIN AND AGAIN I TRIED TO APPROACH HIS DEN AND COME UPON HIM UNAWARE BUT ALWAYS HE WAS TOO ACUTE FOR ME AND SAW OR WINDED ME AND GOT AWAY HE TOO
AND LET THESE AND OTHER STRANGE MEMORIES OF THE LAST FEW DAYS CHASE ONE ANOTHER THROUGH MY MIND
BUT THE ISLANDERS SEEING THAT I WAS REALLY ADRIFT TOOK PITY ON ME I DRIFTED VERY SLOWLY TO THE EASTWARD APPROACHING THE ISLAND SLANTINGLY AND PRESENTLY I SAW WITH HYSTERICAL RELIEF THE LAUNCH COME ROUND AND RETURN TOWARDS ME
HE STOPPED IN THIS CROUCHING ATTITUDE WHEN I TURNED HIS EYES A LITTLE AVERTED FOR A MOMENT WE STOOD EYE TO EYE
WHAT THE MASTER WISHES TO KILL THE MASTER KILLS SAID THE DOG MAN WITH A CERTAIN SATISFACTION IN HIS VOICE AND THAT THEIR SINS MAY GROW I SAID LET THEM LIVE IN THEIR FOLLY UNTIL THEIR TIME IS RIPE LET THEM NOT KNOW THAT I AM THE MASTER
THE MONKEY MAN BORED ME HOWEVER HE ASSUMED ON THE STRENGTH OF HIS FIVE DIGITS THAT HE WAS MY EQUAL AND WAS FOR EVER JABBERING AT ME JABBERING THE MOST ARRANT NONSENSE
YES I SAID WITH ASSURANCE I COULD EAT SOME MUTTON BUT SAID HE WITH A MOMENTARY HESITATION YOU KNOW I'M DYING TO HEAR OF HOW YOU CAME TO BE ALONE IN THAT BOAT DAMN THAT HOWLING
YOU HE SAID IN THE BOAT HE WAS A MAN THEN AT LEAST AS MUCH OF A MAN AS MONTGOMERY'S ATTENDANT FOR HE COULD TALK YES I SAID I CAME IN THE BOAT FROM THE SHIP OH HE SAID
BLOTCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON DRIFTED ACROSS MY EYES MY CONDUCTOR STOPPED SUDDENLY HOME SAID HE AND I STOOD IN A FLOOR OF A CHASM THAT WAS AT FIRST ABSOLUTELY DARK TO ME
WHICH HAD NOW BEEN BROUGHT WITH OTHER LUGGAGE INTO THE ENCLOSURE BEHIND THE HOUSE WERE DESTINED AND A CURIOUS FAINT ODOUR THE HALITUS OF SOMETHING FAMILIAR AN ODOUR THAT HAD BEEN IN THE BACKGROUND OF MY CONSCIOUSNESS HITHERTO SUDDENLY CAME FORWARD INTO THE FOREFRONT OF MY THOUGHTS
YOUR BREAKFAST SAIR HE SAID I STARED AT HIS FACE WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO ANSWER HIM HE TURNED AND WENT TOWARDS THE DOOR REGARDING ME ODDLY OVER HIS SHOULDER I FOLLOWED HIM OUT WITH MY EYES
HE KNOWS SOMETHING OF SCIENCE SAID MONTGOMERY I'M ITCHING TO GET TO WORK AGAIN WITH THIS NEW STUFF SAID THE WHITE HAIRED MAN NODDING TOWARDS THE ENCLOSURE HIS EYES GREW BRIGHTER I DARESAY YOU ARE SAID MONTGOMERY IN ANYTHING BUT A CORDIAL TONE
I SAW THE LEVEL BLUE OF THE SEA THE PATH COILED DOWN ABRUPTLY INTO A NARROW RAVINE BETWEEN TWO TUMBLED AND KNOTTY MASSES OF BLACKISH SCORIAE INTO THIS WE PLUNGED IT WAS EXTREMELY DARK THIS PASSAGE
THE TRADITION OF THE LAW WAS CLEARLY LOSING ITS FORCE I CANNOT PURSUE THIS DISAGREEABLE SUBJECT MY DOG MAN IMPERCEPTIBLY SLIPPED BACK TO THE DOG AGAIN DAY BY DAY HE BECAME DUMB QUADRUPEDAL HAIRY
MONTGOMERY ALMOST STAGGERED INTO HIM AND THEN STOPPED TOO THEN LISTENING INTENTLY WE HEARD COMING THROUGH THE TREES THE SOUND OF VOICES AND FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING US HE IS DEAD SAID A DEEP VIBRATING VOICE
WHICH I TOLD IN CONCISE SENTENCES ENOUGH FOR I FELT HORRIBLY WEAK AND WHEN IT WAS FINISHED HE REVERTED AT ONCE TO THE TOPIC OF NATURAL HISTORY AND HIS OWN BIOLOGICAL STUDIES HE BEGAN TO QUESTION ME CLOSELY ABOUT TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD AND GOWER STREET
I RECOGNISED THE APE MAN I HAD INDEED ALREADY IDENTIFIED HIS VOICE AND TWO OF THE WHITE SWATHED BROWN FEATURED CREATURES I HAD SEEN IN MONTGOMERY'S BOAT
AND AS READY AS A HOSPITAL RABBIT FOR MY FATE HE EMERGED BEHIND THE CORNER FOR I HEARD HIM SHOUT PRENDICK THEN HE BEGAN TO RUN AFTER ME SHOUTING THINGS AS HE RAN THIS TIME RUNNING BLINDLY
AND SUDDENLY IN A TRAMPLED SPACE I CAME UPON A GHASTLY GROUP MY SAINT BERNARD CREATURE LAY ON THE GROUND DEAD AND NEAR HIS BODY CROUCHED THE HYENA SWINE GRIPPING THE QUIVERING FLESH WITH ITS MISSHAPEN CLAWS GNAWING AT IT AND SNARLING WITH DELIGHT
I HEARD SOMETHING BREATHING SAW SOMETHING CROUCHED TOGETHER CLOSE BESIDE ME I HELD MY BREATH TRYING TO SEE WHAT IT WAS IT BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY INTERMINABLY THEN SOMETHING SOFT AND WARM AND MOIST PASSED ACROSS MY HAND ALL MY MUSCLES CONTRACTED
MY THOUGHTS WERE DISTURBED BY A CRYING OF SEA BIRDS HURRYING TOWARDS SOME BLACK OBJECT THAT HAD BEEN STRANDED BY THE WAVES ON THE BEACH NEAR THE ENCLOSURE I KNEW WHAT THAT OBJECT WAS BUT I HAD NOT THE HEART TO GO BACK AND DRIVE THEM OFF
IN TURN I RECALLED EACH ONE I HAD SEEN AND TRIED TO DRAW SOME AUGURY OF ASSISTANCE FROM MY MEMORY THEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A STAGHOUND BAY AND AT THAT REALISED A NEW DANGER I TOOK LITTLE TIME TO THINK
I HAD HALF A MIND TO DROWN MYSELF THEN BUT AN ODD WISH TO SEE THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OUT A QUEER IMPERSONAL SPECTACULAR INTEREST IN MYSELF RESTRAINED ME
AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR I HEARD MONTGOMERY SHOUTING MY NAME FAR AWAY TO THE NORTH THAT SET ME THINKING OF MY PLAN OF ACTION AS I INTERPRETED IT THEN
I SNATCHED MY HAND AWAY A CRY OF ALARM BEGAN AND WAS STIFLED IN MY THROAT
POINTED IS THERE A LAW NOW ASKED THE MONKEY MAN
ITS SPRING CARRIED IT OVER ME I FELL UNDER THE HIND PART OF ITS BODY BUT LUCKILY I HAD HIT AS I MEANT AND IT HAD DIED EVEN AS IT LEAPT
THE WHITE HAIRED MAN WHO I KNEW WAS A GOOD SIX FEET IN HEIGHT SAT A HEAD BELOW ANY ONE OF THE THREE I FOUND AFTERWARDS THAT REALLY NONE WERE TALLER THAN MYSELF BUT THEIR BODIES WERE ABNORMALLY LONG AND THE THIGH PART OF THE LEG SHORT AND CURIOUSLY TWISTED
AND CROUCHED IN THE BOTTOM OF ITS LITTLE CAGE OVERBOARD WITH EM BAWLED THE CAPTAIN OVERBOARD WITH EM
I WAS JERKED BACK AS THE ROPE TIGHTENED BETWEEN THE BOATS
THEN THE NOISE OVERHEAD BEGAN AGAIN
THE PILE OF THINGS COMPLETED ALL THREE MEN LAID HOLD OF THE TRUCK AND BEGAN SHOVING THE TON WEIGHT OR SO UPON IT AFTER THE PUMA PRESENTLY MONTGOMERY LEFT THEM AND COMING BACK TO ME HELD OUT HIS HAND I'M GLAD SAID HE FOR MY OWN PART
HE STOOD IN MY WAY SO THAT I HAD PERFORCE TO TAP HIS SHOULDER TO COME ON DECK HE CAME ROUND WITH A START AND STAGGERED BACK A FEW PACES TO STARE AT ME IT NEEDED NO EXPERT EYE TO TELL THAT THE MAN WAS STILL DRUNK HULLO
ALTOGETHER PERHAPS TWENTY OF THE BEAST FOLK SQUATTED STARING INTO THE FIRE OR TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER HE IS DEAD HE IS DEAD THE MASTER IS DEAD SAID THE VOICE OF THE APE MAN TO THE RIGHT OF ME
BUT FROM THAT NIGHT UNTIL THE END CAME THERE WAS BUT ONE THING HAPPENED TO TELL SAVE A SERIES OF INNUMERABLE SMALL UNPLEASANT DETAILS AND THE FRETTING OF AN INCESSANT UNEASINESS
THE OTHERS GATHERED ROUND AND STARED FOR A SPACE AT LAST WE DREW NEAR THE WESTWARD EXTREMITY OF THE ISLAND WE CAME UPON THE GNAWED AND MUTILATED BODY OF THE PUMA ITS SHOULDER BONE SMASHED BY A BULLET AND PERHAPS TWENTY YARDS FARTHER FOUND AT LAST WHAT WE SOUGHT
HIS REVOLVER WE COULD NOT FIND MONTGOMERY TURNED HIM OVER RESTING AT INTERVALS AND WITH THE HELP OF THE SEVEN BEAST PEOPLE FOR HE WAS A HEAVY MAN WE CARRIED MOREAU BACK TO THE ENCLOSURE THE NIGHT WAS DARKLING
MY CHEST STRAINING MY HEART BEATING IN MY EARS AND THEN HEARING NOTHING OF MONTGOMERY OR HIS MAN AND FEELING UPON THE VERGE OF EXHAUSTION I DOUBLED SHARPLY BACK TOWARDS THE BEACH AS I JUDGED AND LAY DOWN IN THE SHELTER OF A CANEBRAKE
I KNEW NO WAY OF GETTING ANYTHING TO EAT I WAS TOO IGNORANT OF BOTANY TO DISCOVER ANY RESORT OF ROOT OR FRUIT THAT MIGHT LIE ABOUT ME I HAD NO MEANS OF TRAPPING THE FEW RABBITS UPON THE ISLAND
AS I CAME UP THE LADDER I SAW AGAINST THE FLUSHED SKY FOR THE SUN WAS JUST RISING THE BROAD BACK AND RED HAIR OF THE CAPTAIN AND OVER HIS SHOULDER THE PUMA SPINNING FROM A TACKLE RIGGED ON TO THE MIZZEN SPANKER BOOM THE POOR BRUTE SEEMED HORRIBLY SCARED
I TALKED NOW WITHOUT THE CATCHING IN MY BREATH DUE TO THE INTENSITY OF MY EXCITEMENT THAT HAD TROUBLED ME AT FIRST IN THE COURSE OF ABOUT AN HOUR I HAD REALLY CONVINCED SEVERAL OF THE BEAST FOLK OF THE TRUTH OF MY ASSERTIONS AND TALKED MOST OF THE OTHERS INTO A DUBIOUS STATE
CAME IN AGAIN AS I STOOD THERE AND I ASKED HIM FOR SOME CLOTHES HE LENT ME SOME DUCK THINGS OF HIS OWN FOR THOSE I HAD WORN IN THE BOAT HAD BEEN THROWN OVERBOARD THEY WERE RATHER LOOSE FOR ME FOR HE WAS LARGE AND LONG IN HIS LIMBS
I HEARD THE SWISH OF THE WATER AS THE SHIP WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT ROUND AND A FOAMY YELLOW GREEN WAVE FLEW ACROSS THE LITTLE ROUND WINDOW AND LEFT IT STREAMING I JUMPED INTO MY CLOTHES AND WENT ON DECK
AND THEN THE OTHERS NONE ATTEMPTED TO RISE OR SALUTE ME I FELT TOO FAINT AND WEARY TO INSIST AND I LET THE MOMENT PASS I WANT FOOD SAID I ALMOST APOLOGETICALLY AND DRAWING NEAR THERE IS FOOD IN THE HUTS SAID AN OX BOAR MAN
BROAD SHOULDERED COMPANION SITTING CRAMPED UP WITH THE DOGS AND SEVERAL PACKING CASES IN THE STERN SHEETS THIS INDIVIDUAL STARED FIXEDLY AT ME WITHOUT MOVING OR SPEAKING THE BLACK FACED CRIPPLE WAS GLARING AT ME AS FIXEDLY IN THE BOWS NEAR THE PUMA
WE HAD SOME FOOD AND THEN ALL THREE OF US STARTED IT IS POSSIBLY DUE TO THE TENSION OF MY MIND AT THE TIME BUT EVEN NOW THAT START INTO THE HOT STILLNESS OF THE TROPICAL AFTERNOON IS A SINGULARLY VIVID IMPRESSION
HE WAS ALREADY MORE THAN HALF FUDDLED I TOLD HIM THAT SOME SERIOUS THING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO MOREAU BY THIS TIME OR HE WOULD HAVE RETURNED BEFORE THIS AND THAT IT BEHOVED US TO ASCERTAIN WHAT THAT CATASTROPHE WAS MONTGOMERY RAISED SOME FEEBLE OBJECTIONS AND AT LAST AGREED
IN THIS WAY I BECAME ONE AMONG THE BEAST PEOPLE IN THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU WHEN I AWOKE IT WAS DARK ABOUT ME MY ARM ACHED IN ITS BANDAGES I SAT UP WONDERING AT FIRST WHERE I MIGHT BE I HEARD COARSE VOICES TALKING OUTSIDE
I BEGAN WALKING ALONG THE BEACH IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION DESIGNING TO COME ROUND THE EASTWARD CORNER OF THE ISLAND AND SO APPROACH THE RAVINE OF THE HUTS WITHOUT TRAVERSING THE POSSIBLE AMBUSCADES OF THE THICKETS
UNTIL I BEGAN TO THINK OF FOOD AND DRINK
AT LAST I MUST CONFESS MY VOICE SUDDENLY BROKE IN THE MIDDLE OF A VIGOROUS THREAT I FELT A GUST OF HYSTERICAL PETULANCE AND WENT AFT AND STARED DISMALLY AT NOTHING
THAT CAPTAIN WAS A SILLY ASS HE'D HAVE MADE THINGS LIVELY FOR YOU IT WAS YOU SAID I THAT SAVED ME AGAIN THAT DEPENDS YOU'LL FIND THIS ISLAND AN INFERNALLY RUM PLACE I PROMISE YOU I'D WATCH MY GOINGS CAREFULLY
I TURNED AND SAW THAT THE LAUNCH HAD NOW BEEN UNLOADED RUN OUT AGAIN AND WAS BEING BEACHED AND THE WHITE HAIRED MAN WAS WALKING TOWARDS US HE ADDRESSED MONTGOMERY AND NOW COMES THE PROBLEM OF THIS UNINVITED GUEST WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH HIM
TO OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE PRESENTLY THE WHITE HAIRED MAN SEEMED TO RECOLLECT MY PRESENCE AND CAME UP TO ME YOU LOOK SAID HE AS THOUGH YOU HAD SCARCELY BREAKFASTED
I USED TO GO MOPING ABOUT THE ISLAND TRYING WITH ALL MY MIGHT TO SOLVE THIS ONE LAST DIFFICULTY SOMETIMES I WOULD GIVE WAY TO WILD OUTBURSTS OF RAGE AND HACK AND SPLINTER SOME UNLUCKY TREE IN MY INTOLERABLE VEXATION BUT I COULD THINK OF NOTHING
A MAN STOOD AWAITING US AT THE WATER'S EDGE I FANCIED WHILE WE WERE STILL FAR OFF THAT I SAW SOME OTHER AND VERY GROTESQUE LOOKING CREATURES SCUTTLE INTO THE BUSHES UPON THE SLOPE BUT I SAW NOTHING OF THESE AS WE DREW NEARER
THE DOCTOR WAS SIMPLY HOWLED OUT OF THE COUNTRY IT MAY BE THAT HE DESERVED TO BE BUT I STILL THINK THAT THE TEPID SUPPORT OF HIS FELLOW INVESTIGATORS AND HIS DESERTION BY THE GREAT BODY OF SCIENTIFIC WORKERS WAS A SHAMEFUL THING
I THINK NOW THAT HE WAS THE SILLIEST CREATURE I EVER MET HE HAD DEVELOPED IN THE MOST WONDERFUL WAY THE DISTINCTIVE SILLINESS OF MAN WITHOUT LOSING ONE JOT OF THE NATURAL FOLLY OF A MONKEY
NO GO AWAY I INSISTED AND SNAPPED MY WHIP
I HEARD SOME STRANGE NOISES AND THRUST THE KNUCKLES OF MY LEFT HAND INTO MY EYES I BECAME AWARE OF A DISAGREEABLE ODOR LIKE THAT OF A MONKEY'S CAGE ILL CLEANED BEYOND THE ROCK OPENED AGAIN UPON A GRADUAL SLOPE OF SUNLIT GREENERY
HE SPOKE WITH A SLOBBERING ARTICULATION WITH THE GHOST OF A LISP WHAT SHIP IS THIS I SAID SLOWLY HOARSE FROM MY LONG SILENCE IT'S A LITTLE TRADER FROM ARICA AND CALLAO
I DARESAY IT'S ALL DIFFERENT NOW BUT I MUST LOOK UP THAT ASS OF A COOK AND SEE WHAT HE'S DONE TO YOUR MUTTON THE GROWLING OVERHEAD WAS RENEWED SO SUDDENLY AND WITH SO MUCH SAVAGE ANGER THAT IT STARTLED ME WHAT'S THAT
HE HAD AN IDEA I BELIEVE THAT TO GABBLE ABOUT NAMES THAT MEANT NOTHING WAS THE PROPER USE OF SPEECH HE CALLED IT BIG THINKS TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM LITTLE THINKS THE SANE EVERY DAY INTERESTS OF LIFE IF EVER I MADE A REMARK HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HE WOULD PRAISE IT VERY MUCH
IT WAS NO GOOD ANSWERING THE BRUTE BUT I CERTAINLY DID NOT EXPECT HIS NEXT MOVE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO THE GANGWAY BY WHICH MONTGOMERY STOOD TALKING TO A MASSIVE GREY HAIRED MAN IN DIRTY BLUE FLANNELS WHO HAD APPARENTLY JUST COME ABOARD
BUT THE LAUNCH WAS NOW FULLY LADEN AND WAS SHOVED OFF HASTILY A BROADENING GAP OF GREEN WATER APPEARED UNDER ME AND I PUSHED BACK WITH ALL MY STRENGTH TO AVOID FALLING HEADLONG
HE HAD A LARGE ALMOST LIPLESS MOUTH EXTRAORDINARY LANK ARMS LONG THIN FEET AND BOW LEGS AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAVY FACE THRUST FORWARD STARING AT US HE WAS DRESSED LIKE MONTGOMERY AND HIS WHITE HAIRED COMPANION IN JACKET AND TROUSERS OF BLUE SERGE
DURING THAT TIME THEY RESPECTED THE USAGE ESTABLISHED BY THE LAW AND BEHAVED WITH GENERAL DECORUM ONCE I FOUND ANOTHER RABBIT TORN TO PIECES BY THE HYENA SWINE I AM ASSURED BUT THAT WAS ALL
AS I WATCHED THEM DISAPPEARING THE WHITE HAIRED MAN RETURNED WITH A BRANDY FLASK AND SOME BISCUITS SOMETHING TO GO ON WITH PRENDICK SAID HE IN A FAR MORE FAMILIAR TONE THAN BEFORE I MADE NO ADO BUT SET TO WORK ON THE BISCUITS AT ONCE
I SPENT MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT GRUBBING AMONG THE BLACK RUINS OF THE ENCLOSURE AND ON THE BEACH WHERE THE BOATS HAD BEEN BURNT LOOKING FOR NAILS AND OTHER STRAY PIECES OF METAL THAT MIGHT PROVE OF SERVICE
FOR THEM AND FOR ME IT CAME WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE SHOCK I STILL WENT AMONG THEM IN SAFETY BECAUSE NO JOLT IN THE DOWNWARD GLIDE HAD RELEASED THE INCREASING CHARGE OF EXPLOSIVE ANIMALISM THAT OUSTED THE HUMAN DAY BY DAY BUT I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT SOON NOW THAT SHOCK MUST COME
HE HESITATED AS HE APPROACHED GO AWAY CRIED I
SAID I HAVE BROKEN THE LAW THEY WILL DIE SOME HAVE DIED SHOW US NOW WHERE HIS OLD BODY LIES THE BODY HE CAST AWAY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MORE NEED OF IT IT IS THIS WAY MAN WHO WALKED IN THE SEA
FOR A MOMENT THE OPENING OF THE HUT WAS BLACKENED BY THE EXIT OF THE DOG MAN THEN I FOLLOWED AND STOOD UP ALMOST IN THE EXACT SPOT WHERE I HAD BEEN WHEN I HAD HEARD MOREAU AND HIS STAGHOUND PURSUING ME
ALMOST LIKE HORSEHAIR AND SEEMED AS THEY SAT
AND LOOKING BACK OVER THE GUNWALE I SAW THE SCHOONER STANDING AWAY FROM ME WITH THE RED HAIRED CAPTAIN MOCKING AT ME OVER THE TAFFRAIL AND TURNING TOWARDS THE ISLAND SAW THE LAUNCH GROWING SMALLER AS SHE APPROACHED THE BEACH
M'LING WENT FIRST HIS SHOULDER HUNCHED HIS STRANGE BLACK HEAD MOVING WITH QUICK STARTS AS HE PEERED FIRST ON THIS SIDE OF THE WAY AND THEN ON THAT HE WAS UNARMED HIS AXE HE HAD DROPPED WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED THE SWINE MAN TEETH WERE HIS WEAPONS WHEN IT CAME TO FIGHTING
THE MASTER'S WILL IS SWEET SAID THE DOG MAN WITH THE READY TACT OF HIS CANINE BLOOD BUT ONE HAS SINNED SAID I HIM I WILL KILL WHENEVER I MAY MEET HIM WHEN I SAY TO YOU THAT IS HE SEE THAT YOU FALL UPON HIM
IN THE DAWN THE SAIL WAS NEARER AND I SAW IT WAS THE DIRTY LUG SAIL OF A SMALL BOAT BUT IT SAILED STRANGELY MY EYES WERE WEARY WITH WATCHING AND I PEERED AND COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM TWO MEN WERE IN THE BOAT SITTING LOW DOWN ONE BY THE BOWS THE OTHER AT THE RUDDER
BUT AT NIGHT THE AIR WAS HIDEOUS WITH THEIR CALLS AND HOWLING I HAD HALF A MIND TO MAKE A MASSACRE OF THEM TO BUILD TRAPS OR FIGHT THEM WITH MY KNIFE HAD I POSSESSED SUFFICIENT CARTRIDGES I SHOULD NOT HAVE HESITATED TO BEGIN THE KILLING
HE LEFT THE ROOM BY THE OUTER DOOR AS IF TO AVOID OPENING THE INNER ONE AGAIN WE USUALLY HAVE OUR MEALS IN HERE SAID MONTGOMERY AND THEN AS IF IN DOUBT WENT OUT AFTER THE OTHER MOREAU I HEARD HIM CALL AND FOR THE MOMENT I DO NOT THINK I NOTICED
BUT SNATCHING UP MY NAILED STICK RUSHED HEADLONG FROM MY HIDING PLACE TOWARDS THE SOUND OF THE SEA I REMEMBER A GROWTH OF THORNY PLANTS WITH SPINES THAT STABBED LIKE PEN KNIVES I EMERGED BLEEDING AND WITH TORN CLOTHES UPON THE LIP OF A LONG CREEK OPENING NORTHWARD
AM I ELIGIBLE FOR SOLID FOOD I ASKED THANKS TO ME HE SAID
HE TOLD ME CASUALLY THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS THREE PARTS DRUNK IN HIS OWN CABIN AS I ASSUMED THE CLOTHES
I SCARCELY NOTICED THE TRANSITION FROM THE COMPANION ON MY RIGHT HAND TO THE LURCHING DOG AT MY SIDE AS THE CARELESSNESS AND DISORGANISATION INCREASED FROM DAY TO DAY THE LANE OF DWELLING PLACES AT NO TIME VERY SWEET BECAME SO LOATHSOME THAT I LEFT IT
THEY HAVE BEEN SLAIN EVEN THE SAYER OF THE LAW EVEN THE OTHER WITH THE WHIP GREAT IS THE LAW COME AND SEE NONE ESCAPE SAID ONE OF THEM ADVANCING AND PEERING NONE ESCAPE SAID I THEREFORE HEAR AND DO AS I COMMAND
MAY I ASK WHAT THAT SIGNIFIES I TOLD HIM I HAD SPENT SOME YEARS AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE AND HAD DONE SOME RESEARCHES IN BIOLOGY UNDER HUXLEY HE RAISED HIS EYEBROWS SLIGHTLY AT THAT
I HAVE NEVER SEEN MEN SO WRAPPED UP BEFORE AND WOMEN SO ONLY IN THE EAST THEY WORE TURBANS TOO AND THEREUNDER PEERED OUT THEIR ELFIN FACES AT ME FACES WITH PROTRUDING LOWER JAWS AND BRIGHT EYES THEY HAD LANK BLACK HAIR
IT WAS A HEAVY WOODEN GATE FRAMED IN IRON AND LOCKED WITH THE CARGO OF THE LAUNCH PILED OUTSIDE IT AND AT THE CORNER WE CAME TO A SMALL DOORWAY I HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED THE WHITE HAIRED MAN PRODUCED A BUNDLE OF KEYS FROM THE POCKET OF HIS GREASY BLUE JACKET
MOREAU LAY FACE DOWNWARD IN A TRAMPLED SPACE IN A CANEBRAKE ONE HAND WAS ALMOST SEVERED AT THE WRIST AND HIS SILVERY HAIR WAS DABBLED IN BLOOD HIS HEAD HAD BEEN BATTERED IN BY THE FETTERS OF THE PUMA THE BROKEN CANES BENEATH HIM WERE SMEARED WITH BLOOD
I TOLD HIM MY NAME EDWARD PRENDICK AND HOW I HAD TAKEN TO NATURAL HISTORY AS A RELIEF FROM THE DULNESS OF MY COMFORTABLE INDEPENDENCE HE SEEMED INTERESTED IN THIS I'VE DONE SOME SCIENCE MYSELF
AS I APPROACHED THE MONSTER LIFTED ITS GLARING EYES TO MINE ITS LIPS WENT TREMBLING BACK FROM ITS RED STAINED TEETH AND IT GROWLED MENACINGLY IT WAS NOT AFRAID AND NOT ASHAMED THE LAST VESTIGE OF THE HUMAN TAINT HAD VANISHED
IN THE EARLY MORNING IT WAS THE SECOND MORNING AFTER MY RECOVERY AND I BELIEVE THE FOURTH AFTER I WAS PICKED UP I AWOKE THROUGH AN AVENUE OF TUMULTUOUS DREAMS DREAMS OF GUNS AND HOWLING MOBS AND BECAME SENSIBLE OF A HOARSE SHOUTING ABOVE ME
EVEN NOW THEY TALK TOGETHER BEYOND THERE THEY SAY THE MASTER IS DEAD THE OTHER WITH THE WHIP IS DEAD THAT OTHER WHO WALKED IN THE SEA IS AS WE ARE WE HAVE NO MASTER NO WHIPS NO HOUSE OF PAIN ANY MORE THERE IS AN END
IS THE LAW NOT ALIVE THIS CAME OF BREAKING THE LAW HE PEERED AT THE BODY HE SENDS THE FIRE THAT KILLS SAID HE IN HIS DEEP VOICE REPEATING PART OF THE RITUAL
THE HUNTING OF THE MAN IT CAME BEFORE MY MIND WITH AN UNREASONABLE HOPE OF ESCAPE THAT THE OUTER DOOR OF MY ROOM WAS STILL OPEN TO ME I WAS CONVINCED NOW ABSOLUTELY ASSURED
THE GREY THING LEAPT ASIDE M'LING WITH A SNARL FLEW AT IT AND WAS STRUCK ASIDE MONTGOMERY FIRED
I REALISED MORE KEENLY THAN EVER WHAT MOREAU HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE STUBBORN BEAST FLESH THEY WERE REVERTING AND REVERTING VERY RAPIDLY SOME OF THEM THE PIONEERS IN THIS I NOTICED WITH SOME SURPRISE WERE ALL FEMALES
BUT STILL MORE AFRAID OF MY CRACKING RED WHIP LASH AND AFTER SOME FUMBLING AND HESITATION SOME WHIP CRACKING AND SHOUTING THEY LIFTED HIM GINGERLY CARRIED HIM DOWN TO THE BEACH AND WENT SPLASHING INTO THE DAZZLING WELTER OF THE SEA ON SAID I
ONE HAD A SHOCK OF RED HAIR LIKE THE CAPTAIN OF THE IPECACUANHA AND A DIRTY WHITE CAP LAY IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT AS I STOOD BESIDE THE BOAT THREE OF THE BEASTS CAME SLINKING OUT OF THE BUSHES AND SNIFFING TOWARDS ME
THOUGH THEY EVIDENTLY FELT ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES EVERY NOW AND THEN I WOULD COME UPON ONE OR ANOTHER RUNNING ON TOES AND FINGER TIPS AND QUITE UNABLE TO RECOVER THE VERTICAL ATTITUDE THEY HELD THINGS MORE CLUMSILY DRINKING BY SUCTION FEEDING BY GNAWING GREW COMMONER EVERY DAY
AND HIS BRIGHT RESTLESS EYES TRAVELLED OVER ME TO MY HANDS TO THE STICK I CARRIED TO MY FEET TO THE TATTERED PLACES IN MY COAT AND THE CUTS AND SCRATCHES I HAD RECEIVED FROM THE THORNS HE SEEMED PUZZLED AT SOMETHING HIS EYES CAME BACK TO MY HANDS
HE WAS UNMARRIED AND HAD INDEED NOTHING BUT HIS OWN INTEREST TO CONSIDER I FELT CONVINCED THAT THIS MUST BE THE SAME MAN EVERYTHING POINTED TO IT IT DAWNED UPON ME TO WHAT END THE PUMA AND THE OTHER ANIMALS
MONEY CAN ONLY GIVE HAPPINESS WHERE THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO GIVE IT BEYOND A COMPETENCE IT CAN AFFORD NO REAL SATISFACTION AS FAR AS MERE SELF IS CONCERNED
NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM MY INTENTION THAN TO GIVE YOU SUCH AN IDEA COULD YOU HAVE A MOTIVE FOR THE TRUST THAT WAS NOT HONOURABLE AND FLATTERING TO ME AND YET I DO ASSURE YOU REPLIED LUCY
DON'T PALM ALL YOUR ABUSES OF LANGUAGES UPON ME
MAMA SAYS HE WAS IN LOVE WITH YOUR SISTER TOO I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A GREAT COMPLIMENT IF HE WAS FOR HE HARDLY EVER FALLS IN LOVE WITH ANY BODY IS MISTER WILLOUGHBY MUCH KNOWN IN YOUR PART OF SOMERSETSHIRE
AND IT SEEMED AS IF HER TEARS WERE EVEN THEN RESTRAINED WITH DIFFICULTY SHE AVOIDED THE LOOKS OF THEM ALL COULD NEITHER EAT NOR SPEAK AND AFTER SOME TIME ON HER MOTHER'S SILENTLY PRESSING HER HAND WITH TENDER COMPASSION HER SMALL DEGREE OF FORTITUDE
AND HIS DEFERENCE FOR HER OPINION MIGHT VERY WELL JUSTIFY MISSUS JENNINGS'S PERSUASION OF HIS ATTACHMENT AND WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH PERHAPS HAD NOT ELINOR STILL AS FROM THE FIRST BELIEVED MARIANNE HIS REAL FAVOURITE TO MAKE HER SUSPECT IT HERSELF
AND NEEDLESS ALARM OF A LOVER TWO DELIGHTFUL TWILIGHT WALKS ON THE THIRD AND FOURTH EVENINGS OF HER BEING THERE NOT MERELY ON THE DRY GRAVEL OF THE SHRUBBERY BUT ALL OVER THE GROUNDS AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MOST DISTANT PARTS OF THEM
BUT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR SEPARATION
WE ARE ALL UNANIMOUS IN THAT WISH I SUPPOSE SAID ELINOR IN SPITE OF THE INSUFFICIENCY OF WEALTH
SOMETIMES ONE IS GUIDED BY WHAT THEY SAY OF THEMSELVES AND VERY FREQUENTLY BY WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY OF THEM WITHOUT GIVING ONESELF TIME TO DELIBERATE AND JUDGE
IS BECOME A MERE JARGON EVERY BODY PRETENDS TO FEEL AND TRIES TO DESCRIBE WITH THE TASTE AND ELEGANCE OF HIM WHO FIRST DEFINED WHAT PICTURESQUE BEAUTY WAS I DETEST JARGON OF EVERY KIND AND SOMETIMES I HAVE KEPT MY FEELINGS TO MYSELF
AND COULD NEVER BE FOUND WHEN THE OTHERS SET OFF
AND CRYING OVER THE PRESENT REVERSE FOR THE CHIEF OF THE MORNING
IS SHE ILL I HOPE NOT HE REPLIED
EVERY ONE WAS SILENT MISSUS DASHWOOD FIRST SPOKE I HAVE ONLY TO ADD MY DEAR WILLOUGHBY
INDEED I AM BOUND TO LET YOU INTO THE SECRET FOR YOU ARE A PARTY CONCERNED
THAT THE HAIR WAS HER OWN SHE INSTANTANEOUSLY FELT AS WELL SATISFIED AS MARIANNE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT WHAT MARIANNE CONSIDERED AS A FREE GIFT FROM HER SISTER ELINOR WAS CONSCIOUS MUST HAVE BEEN PROCURED BY SOME THEFT OR CONTRIVANCE UNKNOWN TO HERSELF
HOW CAN YOU THINK OF DIRT WITH SUCH OBJECTS BEFORE YOU BECAUSE REPLIED HE SMILING
THE VISIT OF THE MISS STEELES AT BARTON PARK WAS LENGTHENED FAR BEYOND WHAT THE FIRST INVITATION IMPLIED THEIR FAVOUR INCREASED THEY COULD NOT BE SPARED SIR JOHN WOULD NOT HEAR OF THEIR GOING AND IN SPITE OF THEIR NUMEROUS AND LONG ARRANGED ENGAGEMENTS IN EXETER
ELINOR WAS VERY ANGRY BUT MARIANNE SEEMED ENTIRELY INSENSIBLE OF THE STING FOR SHE CALMLY REPLIED NOT SO INDEED FOR SERIOUSLY SPEAKING I AM VERY SURE THAT CONSCIENCE ONLY KEPT EDWARD FROM HARLEY STREET
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING YOUR SISTER OVER TO YOUR PLAN OF GENERAL CIVILITY SAID EDWARD TO ELINOR DO YOU GAIN NO GROUND QUITE THE CONTRARY REPLIED ELINOR LOOKING EXPRESSIVELY AT MARIANNE MY JUDGMENT HE RETURNED IS ALL ON YOUR SIDE OF THE QUESTION
THIS WAS A SUBJECT WHICH ENSURED MARIANNE'S ATTENTION AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE HER OWN ADMIRATION OF THESE SCENES
BUT THE FEELINGS WHICH MADE SUCH COMPOSURE A DISGRACE LEFT HER IN NO DANGER OF INCURRING IT SHE WAS AWAKE THE WHOLE NIGHT AND SHE WEPT THE GREATEST PART OF IT SHE GOT UP WITH A HEADACHE WAS UNABLE TO TALK AND UNWILLING TO TAKE ANY NOURISHMENT
WHAT ARE MISSUS FERRARS'S VIEWS FOR YOU AT PRESENT EDWARD SAID SHE WHEN DINNER WAS OVER AND THEY HAD DRAWN ROUND THE FIRE
ALL THIS THOUGHT ELINOR IS VERY PRETTY BUT IT CAN IMPOSE UPON NEITHER OF US BUT WHAT SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ARE YOUR VIEWS OR HAVE YOU NONE BUT THAT OF WAITING FOR MISSUS FERRARS'S DEATH
IT SEEMS BUT THE WORK OF A MOMENT AND LAST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US SO HAPPY SO CHEERFUL SO AFFECTIONATE AND NOW AFTER ONLY TEN MINUTES NOTICE GONE TOO WITHOUT INTENDING TO RETURN
SUCH VIOLENCE OF AFFLICTION INDEED COULD NOT BE SUPPORTED FOR EVER IT SUNK WITHIN A FEW DAYS INTO A CALMER MELANCHOLY BUT THESE EMPLOYMENTS TO WHICH SHE DAILY RECURRED HER SOLITARY WALKS AND SILENT MEDITATIONS
CONSIDERING HER SISTER'S YOUTH AND URGED THE MATTER FARTHER BUT IN VAIN COMMON SENSE COMMON CARE COMMON PRUDENCE WERE ALL SUNK IN MISSUS DASHWOOD'S ROMANTIC DELICACY
ELINOR SAW WITH GREAT UNEASINESS THE LOW SPIRITS OF HER FRIEND HIS VISIT AFFORDED HER BUT A VERY PARTIAL SATISFACTION
YOU MUST NOT CONFOUND MY MEANING I AM GUILTY I CONFESS OF HAVING OFTEN WISHED YOU TO
ONE MOMENT SHE FEARED THAT NO SERIOUS DESIGN HAD EVER BEEN FORMED ON HIS SIDE AND THE NEXT THAT SOME UNFORTUNATE QUARREL HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND HER SISTER
TIS BECAUSE YOU ARE AN INDIFFERENT PERSON SAID LUCY WITH SOME PIQUE AND LAYING A PARTICULAR STRESS ON THOSE WORDS THAT YOUR JUDGMENT MIGHT JUSTLY HAVE SUCH WEIGHT WITH ME
STEALING AWAY THROUGH THE WINDING SHRUBBERIES NOW JUST BEGINNING TO BE IN BEAUTY TO GAIN A DISTANT EMINENCE WHERE FROM ITS GRECIAN TEMPLE HER EYE WANDERING OVER A WIDE TRACT OF COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH EAST
FOR NOT ONLY WAS IT CONSIDERED AS HER FUTURE HOME BY HER BROTHER AND MISSUS JENNINGS BUT EVEN LUCY WHEN THEY PARTED GAVE HER A PRESSING INVITATION TO VISIT HER THERE VERY EARLY IN APRIL
HE COLOURED AS HE REPLIED YOU ARE VERY KIND BUT I HAVE NO IDEA OF RETURNING INTO DEVONSHIRE IMMEDIATELY MY VISITS TO MISSUS SMITH ARE NEVER REPEATED WITHIN THE TWELVEMONTH
HE JOINED HER AND MARIANNE IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE OTHERS WERE DOWN AND MARIANNE WHO WAS ALWAYS EAGER TO PROMOTE THEIR HAPPINESS AS FAR AS SHE COULD SOON LEFT THEM TO THEMSELVES BUT BEFORE SHE WAS HALF WAY UPSTAIRS SHE HEARD THE PARLOUR DOOR OPEN
MY ENGAGEMENTS AT PRESENT REPLIED WILLOUGHBY CONFUSEDLY ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT I DARE NOT FLATTER MYSELF HE STOPT MISSUS DASHWOOD WAS TOO MUCH ASTONISHED TO SPEAK
THEY SAW HIM STEP INTO HIS CARRIAGE AND IN A MINUTE IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT MISSUS DASHWOOD FELT TOO MUCH FOR SPEECH AND INSTANTLY QUITTED THE PARLOUR TO GIVE WAY IN SOLITUDE TO THE CONCERN AND ALARM
I CAN EASILY BELIEVE IT TO BE FULL OF ROCKS AND PROMONTORIES GREY MOSS AND BRUSH WOOD BUT THESE ARE ALL LOST ON ME I KNOW NOTHING OF THE PICTURESQUE
AND THEY MAY SOON BE ENTIRELY DONE AWAY IF WE FIND THEY CORRESPOND EVERY FEAR OF MINE WILL BE REMOVED A MIGHTY CONCESSION INDEED IF YOU WERE TO SEE THEM AT THE ALTAR
I WANT NO PROOF OF THEIR AFFECTION SAID ELINOR BUT OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT I DO I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED OF BOTH YET NOT A SYLLABLE HAS BEEN SAID TO YOU ON THE SUBJECT BY EITHER OF THEM
SAID MISTER PALMER MARIANNE REMAINED PERFECTLY SILENT THOUGH HER COUNTENANCE BETRAYED HER INTEREST IN WHAT WAS SAID IS IT VERY UGLY
WHAT YOU THOUGHT NOBODY COULD DANCE BECAUSE A CERTAIN PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IS GONE I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL CRIED SIR JOHN THAT WILLOUGHBY WERE AMONG US AGAIN THIS AND MARIANNE'S BLUSHING GAVE NEW SUSPICIONS TO EDWARD
ELINOR HARDLY KNEW WHETHER TO SMILE OR SIGH AT THIS ASSERTION LUCY WENT ON
SHE COULD EASILY CONCEIVE THAT MARRIAGE MIGHT NOT BE IMMEDIATELY IN THEIR POWER FOR THOUGH WILLOUGHBY WAS INDEPENDENT THERE WAS NO REASON TO BELIEVE HIM RICH HIS ESTATE HAD BEEN RATED BY SIR JOHN AT ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED A YEAR
IF YOU COULD BE SUPPOSED TO BE BIASED IN ANY RESPECT BY YOUR OWN FEELINGS YOUR OPINION WOULD NOT BE WORTH HAVING ELINOR THOUGHT IT WISEST TO MAKE NO ANSWER TO THIS
AND WONDERED WHETHER MISTER PALMER AND COLONEL BRANDON WOULD GET FARTHER THAN READING THAT NIGHT ELINOR HOWEVER LITTLE CONCERNED IN IT JOINED IN THEIR DISCOURSE AND MARIANNE WHO HAD THE KNACK OF FINDING HER WAY IN EVERY HOUSE TO THE LIBRARY
HOW FEW PEOPLE KNOW WHAT COMFORT IS SIR JOHN IS AS STUPID AS THE WEATHER THE REST OF THE COMPANY SOON DROPT IN I AM AFRAID MISS MARIANNE SAID SIR JOHN
AMONGST THE OBJECTS IN THE SCENE THEY SOON DISCOVERED AN ANIMATED ONE IT WAS A MAN ON HORSEBACK RIDING TOWARDS THEM IN A FEW MINUTES THEY COULD DISTINGUISH HIM TO BE A GENTLEMAN
NO NOT ALL ANSWERED MARIANNE WE COULD NOT BE MORE UNFORTUNATELY SITUATED MARIANNE CRIED HER SISTER HOW CAN YOU SAY SO HOW CAN YOU BE SO UNJUST
SHE WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR HOWEVER TO REGARD IT AS AN AFFRONT AND AFFECTING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT PASSED BY INSTANTLY TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE SHE INTERNALLY RESOLVED HENCEFORWARD TO CATCH EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF EYEING THE HAIR AND OF SATISFYING HERSELF BEYOND ALL DOUBT
CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE SUDDEN TERMINATION OF COLONEL BRANDON'S VISIT AT THE PARK WITH HIS STEADINESS IN CONCEALING ITS CAUSE FILLED THE MIND AND RAISED THE WONDER OF MISSUS JENNINGS FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS SHE WAS A GREAT WONDERER
DECLARED AT ONCE HIS AFFECTION AND HAPPINESS SHALL WE SEE YOU TOMORROW TO DINNER SAID MISSUS DASHWOOD WHEN HE WAS LEAVING THEM I DO NOT ASK YOU TO COME IN THE MORNING FOR WE MUST WALK TO THE PARK TO CALL ON LADY MIDDLETON
WITH ALMOST EVERY OTHER MAN IN THE WORLD IT WOULD BE AN ALARMING PROSPECT BUT EDWARD'S AFFECTION AND CONSTANCY NOTHING CAN DEPRIVE ME OF I KNOW THAT CONVICTION MUST BE EVERY THING TO YOU AND HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORTED BY THE SAME TRUST IN YOUR'S
THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE SHADE OF HER OWN EDWARD'S EMBARRASSMENT LASTED SOME TIME AND IT ENDED IN AN ABSENCE OF MIND STILL MORE SETTLED HE WAS PARTICULARLY GRAVE THE WHOLE MORNING MARIANNE SEVERELY CENSURED HERSELF FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID
BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY WERE VISITED BY SIR JOHN AND MISSUS JENNINGS WHO HAVING HEARD OF THE ARRIVAL OF A GENTLEMAN AT THE COTTAGE CAME TO TAKE A SURVEY OF THE GUEST WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS MOTHER IN LAW SIR JOHN WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING
YOU MUST THINK WRETCHEDLY INDEED OF WILLOUGHBY IF AFTER ALL THAT HAS OPENLY PASSED BETWEEN THEM YOU CAN DOUBT THE NATURE OF THE TERMS ON WHICH THEY ARE TOGETHER HAS HE BEEN ACTING A PART IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO YOUR SISTER ALL THIS TIME
I HAVE THE WHIP HAND OF YOU CHARLOTTE LAUGHED HEARTILY TO THINK THAT HER HUSBAND COULD NOT GET RID OF HER AND EXULTINGLY SAID SHE DID NOT CARE HOW CROSS HE WAS TO HER AS THEY MUST LIVE TOGETHER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE
I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT HE REPLIED AND YET I HAVE ALWAYS SET HER DOWN AS A LIVELY GIRL I HAVE FREQUENTLY DETECTED MYSELF IN SUCH KIND OF MISTAKES SAID ELINOR IN A TOTAL MISAPPREHENSION OF CHARACTER IN SOME POINT OR OTHER
SHE LIKED HIM HOWEVER UPON THE WHOLE MUCH BETTER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND IN HER HEART WAS NOT SORRY THAT SHE COULD LIKE HIM NO MORE NOT SORRY TO BE DRIVEN BY THE OBSERVATION OF HIS EPICURISM HIS SELFISHNESS AND HIS CONCEIT
FOR I WAS SOMEHOW OR OTHER AFRAID I HAD OFFENDED YOU BY WHAT I TOLD YOU THAT MONDAY OFFENDED ME HOW COULD YOU SUPPOSE SO BELIEVE ME AND ELINOR SPOKE IT WITH THE TRUEST SINCERITY
THOUGH WE HAVE NOT KNOWN HIM LONG HE IS NO STRANGER IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND WHO HAS EVER SPOKEN TO HIS DISADVANTAGE HAD HE BEEN IN A SITUATION TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY AND MARRY IMMEDIATELY
FOR HIS HEART HAD NOT THE INDIFFERENCE OF LUCY'S NOR COULD HIS CONSCIENCE HAVE QUITE THE EASE OF ELINOR'S LUCY WITH A DEMURE AND SETTLED AIR SEEMED DETERMINED TO MAKE NO CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMFORT OF THE OTHERS
AND WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND HE ONLY REPLIED YOU ARE TOO GOOD MISSUS DASHWOOD LOOKED AT ELINOR WITH SURPRISE ELINOR FELT EQUAL AMAZEMENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS
HER LOVE MADE NO ANSWER AND AFTER SLIGHTLY BOWING TO THE LADIES BEGAN COMPLAINING OF THE WEATHER HOW HORRID ALL THIS IS SAID HE SUCH WEATHER MAKES EVERY THING AND EVERY BODY DISGUSTING
BUT THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN THE CHANCE OF BEING TOLERABLY HAPPY IN MARRIAGE WHICH SINCERE AFFECTION ON HER SIDE WOULD HAVE GIVEN FOR SELF INTEREST ALONE COULD INDUCE A WOMAN TO KEEP A MAN TO AN ENGAGEMENT OF WHICH SHE SEEMED SO THOROUGHLY AWARE THAT HE WAS WEARY
WHOSE EAR HAD CAUGHT THOSE WORDS BY A SUDDEN PAUSE IN MARIANNE'S MUSIC
IN BOOKS TOO AS WELL AS IN MUSIC SHE COURTED THE MISERY WHICH A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE PAST AND PRESENT WAS CERTAIN OF GIVING SHE READ NOTHING BUT WHAT THEY HAD BEEN USED TO READ TOGETHER
ONE OTHER SHORT CALL IN HARLEY STREET IN WHICH ELINOR RECEIVED HER BROTHER'S CONGRATULATIONS ON THEIR TRAVELLING SO FAR TOWARDS BARTON WITHOUT ANY EXPENSE
AND NOW ELINOR WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY NOTHING FOR YOU HAVE ANTICIPATED MY ANSWER THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED
AND THANK HEAVEN YOU ARE WHAT YOU ALWAYS WERE SHE PAUSED NO ONE SPOKE
ON EDWARD'S SIDE MORE PARTICULARLY THERE WAS A DEFICIENCY OF ALL THAT A LOVER OUGHT TO LOOK AND SAY ON SUCH AN OCCASION HE WAS CONFUSED SEEMED SCARCELY SENSIBLE OF PLEASURE IN SEEING THEM LOOKED NEITHER RAPTUROUS NOR GAY SAID LITTLE BUT WHAT WAS FORCED FROM HIM BY QUESTIONS
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN YOUR DOCTRINE I AM SURE NO MARIANNE NEVER MY DOCTRINE HAS NEVER AIMED AT THE SUBJECTION OF THE UNDERSTANDING ALL I HAVE EVER ATTEMPTED TO INFLUENCE HAS BEEN THE BEHAVIOUR
HE IS MOREOVER AWARE THAT SHE DOES DISAPPROVE THE CONNECTION HE DARES NOT THEREFORE AT PRESENT CONFESS TO HER HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH MARIANNE AND HE FEELS HIMSELF OBLIGED
I CAN HARDLY TELL MYSELF BUT SUSPICION OF SOMETHING UNPLEASANT IS THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AN ALTERATION AS WE JUST WITNESSED IN HIM
AND ONLY OCCASIONALLY RUDE TO HIS WIFE AND HER MOTHER SHE FOUND HIM VERY CAPABLE OF BEING A PLEASANT COMPANION AND ONLY PREVENTED FROM BEING SO ALWAYS BY TOO GREAT AN APTITUDE TO FANCY HIMSELF AS MUCH SUPERIOR TO PEOPLE IN GENERAL
HAVE YOU BEEN LATELY IN SUSSEX SAID ELINOR I WAS AT NORLAND ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND HOW DOES DEAR DEAR NORLAND LOOK CRIED MARIANNE
THEY ARE A VERY RESPECTABLE FAMILY MISTER FERRARS AND TOWARDS US HAVE BEHAVED IN THE FRIENDLIEST MANNER HAVE YOU FORGOT MARIANNE HOW MANY PLEASANT DAYS WE HAVE OWED TO THEM NO SAID MARIANNE IN A LOW VOICE NOR HOW MANY PAINFUL MOMENTS
I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
AT THE SIDE OF MARIANNE AND BY HIS FAVOURITE POINTER AT HER FEET ONE EVENING IN PARTICULAR ABOUT A WEEK AFTER COLONEL BRANDON LEFT THE COUNTRY HIS HEART SEEMED MORE THAN USUALLY OPEN
THAT SOMEBODY WOULD GIVE US ALL A LARGE FORTUNE APIECE
MARIANNE SAW AND LISTENED WITH INCREASING SURPRISE SHE BEGAN ALMOST TO FEEL A DISLIKE OF EDWARD AND IT ENDED AS EVERY FEELING MUST END WITH HER BY CARRYING BACK HER THOUGHTS TO WILLOUGHBY
WAS QUITE OVERCOME SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND LEFT THE ROOM THIS VIOLENT OPPRESSION OF SPIRITS CONTINUED THE WHOLE EVENING SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY POWER BECAUSE SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE OF COMMAND OVER HERSELF
WHOSE MANNERS FORMED A CONTRAST SUFFICIENTLY STRIKING TO THOSE OF HIS BROTHER ELECT
I HOPE NOT I BELIEVE NOT CRIED ELINOR I LOVE WILLOUGHBY SINCERELY LOVE HIM AND SUSPICION OF HIS INTEGRITY CANNOT BE MORE PAINFUL TO YOURSELF THAN TO ME IT HAS BEEN INVOLUNTARY
COMPLETED THE INTERCOURSE OF THE BROTHER AND SISTERS IN TOWN AND A FAINT INVITATION FROM FANNY TO COME TO NORLAND WHENEVER IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE IN THEIR WAY WHICH OF ALL THINGS WAS THE MOST UNLIKELY TO OCCUR
AND EAGER AS SHE HAD LONG BEEN TO QUIT IT COULD NOT WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT BID ADIEU TO THE HOUSE IN WHICH SHE HAD FOR THE LAST TIME ENJOYED THOSE HOPES AND THAT CONFIDENCE IN WILLOUGHBY WHICH WERE NOW EXTINGUISHED FOR EVER WITHOUT GREAT PAIN
FROM YOU HER MOTHER AND SO KIND SO INDULGENT A MOTHER THE QUESTION COULD NOT GIVE OFFENCE IT WOULD BE THE NATURAL RESULT OF YOUR AFFECTION FOR HER
SHE COULD NOT ACCOUNT AND IT WAS SO WHOLLY CONTRADICTORY TO THEIR GENERAL OPINIONS AND PRACTICE THAT A DOUBT SOMETIMES ENTERED HER MIND OF THEIR BEING REALLY ENGAGED AND THIS DOUBT WAS ENOUGH TO PREVENT HER MAKING ANY INQUIRY OF MARIANNE
IT WAS NOT INCLINATION THAT HE WANTED ELINOR I COULD PLAINLY SEE THAT HE HAD NOT THE POWER OF ACCEPTING IT I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER I ASSURE YOU
ELINOR BLUSHED IN SPITE OF HERSELF LUCY BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED ANGRILY AT HER SISTER A MUTUAL SILENCE TOOK PLACE FOR SOME TIME LUCY FIRST PUT AN END TO IT BY SAYING IN A LOWER TONE
NO I HOPE MY MOTHER IS NOW CONVINCED THAT I HAVE NO MORE TALENTS THAN INCLINATION FOR A PUBLIC LIFE BUT HOW IS YOUR FAME TO BE ESTABLISHED FOR FAMOUS YOU MUST BE TO SATISFY ALL YOUR FAMILY AND WITH NO INCLINATION FOR EXPENSE NO AFFECTION FOR STRANGERS
IF I COULD PERSUADE MYSELF THAT MY MANNERS WERE PERFECTLY EASY AND GRACEFUL I SHOULD NOT BE SHY BUT YOU WOULD STILL BE RESERVED SAID MARIANNE AND THAT IS WORSE EDWARD STARTED RESERVED AM I RESERVED MARIANNE YES VERY
THE WOODS AND WALKS THICKLY COVERED WITH DEAD LEAVES
SHE WAS PLEASED TO BE FREE HERSELF FROM THE PERSECUTION OF LUCY'S FRIENDSHIP SHE WAS GRATEFUL FOR BRINGING HER SISTER AWAY UNSEEN BY WILLOUGHBY SINCE HIS MARRIAGE AND SHE LOOKED FORWARD WITH HOPE TO WHAT A FEW MONTHS OF TRANQUILITY AT BARTON MIGHT DO TOWARDS RESTORING MARIANNE'S PEACE OF MIND
AND YET TWO THOUSAND A YEAR IS A VERY MODERATE INCOME SAID MARIANNE
BUT ONE EVENING MISSUS DASHWOOD ACCIDENTALLY TAKING UP A VOLUME OF SHAKESPEARE EXCLAIMED WE HAVE NEVER FINISHED HAMLET MARIANNE OUR DEAR WILLOUGHBY WENT AWAY BEFORE WE COULD GET THROUGH IT
TILL HER HEART WAS SO HEAVY THAT NO FARTHER SADNESS COULD BE GAINED AND THIS NOURISHMENT OF GRIEF WAS EVERY DAY APPLIED SHE SPENT WHOLE HOURS AT THE PIANOFORTE ALTERNATELY SINGING AND CRYING HER VOICE OFTEN TOTALLY SUSPENDED BY HER TEARS
WOULD VERY LIKELY SECURE EVERY THING TO ROBERT AND THE IDEA OF THAT FOR EDWARD'S SAKE FRIGHTENS AWAY ALL MY INCLINATION FOR HASTY MEASURES AND FOR YOUR OWN SAKE TOO OR YOU ARE CARRYING YOUR DISINTERESTEDNESS BEYOND REASON
ALL ABOUT IT I ASSURE YOU AND I ADMIRE YOUR TASTE VERY MUCH
AND OF HER BEING PARTICULARLY DISGUSTED WITH HIS MOTHER TILL THEY WERE MORE IN PRIVATE BUT WHY WERE YOU NOT THERE EDWARD WHY DID YOU NOT COME I WAS ENGAGED ELSEWHERE
THEY WERE TO BE MORE THAN TWO DAYS ON THEIR JOURNEY AND MISTER PALMER TRAVELLING MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY WITH COLONEL BRANDON WAS TO JOIN THEM AT CLEVELAND SOON AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL MARIANNE FEW AS HAD BEEN HER HOURS OF COMFORT IN LONDON
AND IS NO ALLOWANCE TO BE MADE FOR INADVERTENCE OR FOR SPIRITS DEPRESSED BY RECENT DISAPPOINTMENT
WHITHER HE WAS PURPOSELY COMING TO VISIT THEM HE WAS WELCOMED BY THEM ALL WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
THE OPENNESS AND HEARTINESS OF HER MANNER MORE THAN ATONED FOR THAT WANT OF RECOLLECTION AND ELEGANCE WHICH MADE HER OFTEN DEFICIENT IN THE FORMS OF POLITENESS HER KINDNESS RECOMMENDED BY SO PRETTY A FACE WAS ENGAGING HER FOLLY
TO REST WITH COMPLACENCY ON THE REMEMBRANCE OF EDWARD'S GENEROUS TEMPER SIMPLE TASTE AND DIFFIDENT FEELINGS OF EDWARD OR AT LEAST OF SOME OF HIS CONCERNS SHE NOW RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE FROM COLONEL BRANDON
DO YOU SUPPOSE HIM REALLY INDIFFERENT TO HER NO I CANNOT THINK THAT HE MUST AND DOES LOVE HER I AM SURE BUT WITH A STRANGE KIND OF TENDERNESS IF HE CAN LEAVE HER WITH SUCH INDIFFERENCE
CHAPTER SIXTEEN MARIANNE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HERSELF VERY INEXCUSABLE HAD SHE BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AT ALL THE FIRST NIGHT AFTER PARTING FROM WILLOUGHBY SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO LOOK HER FAMILY IN THE FACE THE NEXT MORNING HAD SHE NOT RISEN FROM HER BED
I AM SO GLAD WE ARE GOT ACQUAINTED AT LAST CONTINUED CHARLOTTE AND NOW I HOPE WE SHALL ALWAYS BE GREAT FRIENDS YOU CAN'T THINK HOW MUCH I LONGED TO SEE YOU IT IS SO DELIGHTFUL THAT YOU SHOULD LIVE AT THE COTTAGE NOTHING CAN BE LIKE IT TO BE SURE
A THIRD ALMOST AS WELL KNOWN AS WILLOUGHBY'S JOINED THEM IN BEGGING HER TO STOP AND SHE TURNED ROUND WITH SURPRISE TO SEE AND WELCOME EDWARD FERRARS HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO COULD AT THAT MOMENT BE FORGIVEN FOR NOT BEING WILLOUGHBY
AND I AM SO GLAD YOUR SISTER IS GOING TO BE WELL MARRIED I HOPE YOU WILL BE A GREAT DEAL AT COMBE MAGNA IT IS A SWEET PLACE BY ALL ACCOUNTS YOU HAVE BEEN LONG ACQUAINTED WITH COLONEL BRANDON HAVE NOT YOU YES
NOR COULD SHE LEAVE THE PLACE IN WHICH WILLOUGHBY REMAINED BUSY IN NEW ENGAGEMENTS AND NEW SCHEMES IN WHICH SHE COULD HAVE NO SHARE
YOU AND I SIR JOHN SAID MISSUS JENNINGS SHOULD NOT STAND UPON SUCH CEREMONY THEN YOU WOULD BE VERY ILL BRED CRIED MISTER PALMER
AND I CAN PERFECTLY ACCOUNT FOR EVERY THING THAT AT FIRST SEEMED STRANGE TO ME AS WELL AS TO YOU CAN YOU INDEED YES
THAT MUST BE RECOMMENDATION ENOUGH TO HER HUSBAND BUT MISSUS JOHN DASHWOOD WOULD NOT MUCH APPROVE OF EDWARD'S GOING INTO ORDERS THEN I RATHER SUSPECT THAT MY INTEREST WOULD DO VERY LITTLE
WHO GREATLY DISAPPROVED SUCH CONTINUAL SECLUSION THEY WALKED ALONG THE ROAD THROUGH THE VALLEY AND CHIEFLY IN SILENCE FOR MARIANNE'S MIND COULD NOT BE CONTROLLED
SHE WOULD NOT BE FRIGHTENED FROM PAYING HIM THOSE ATTENTIONS WHICH AS A FRIEND AND ALMOST A RELATION WERE HIS DUE BY THE OBSERVANT EYES OF LUCY THOUGH SHE SOON PERCEIVED THEM TO BE NARROWLY WATCHING HER
LUCY HERE LOOKED UP BUT ELINOR WAS CAREFUL IN GUARDING HER COUNTENANCE FROM EVERY EXPRESSION THAT COULD GIVE HER WORDS A SUSPICIOUS TENDENCY EDWARD'S LOVE FOR ME SAID LUCY HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL PUT TO THE TEST BY OUR LONG
HOW VERY OFTEN SIR JOHN FETCHES OUR LETTERS HIMSELF FROM THE POST AND CARRIES THEM TO IT WE HAVE ALREADY AGREED THAT SECRECY MAY BE NECESSARY
WHICH THIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE OCCASIONED ELINOR'S UNEASINESS WAS AT LEAST EQUAL TO HER MOTHER'S SHE THOUGHT OF WHAT HAD JUST PASSED WITH ANXIETY AND DISTRUST
BY INCREASING AILMENTS ON THE CONCERN OF EVERY BODY AND THE NOTICE OF HERSELF PRESCRIPTIONS POURED IN FROM ALL QUARTERS AND AS USUAL WERE ALL DECLINED THOUGH HEAVY AND FEVERISH WITH A PAIN IN HER LIMBS AND A COUGH AND A SORE THROAT
AS EVERY ONE MUST BE WHO TAKES A VERY LIVELY INTEREST IN ALL THE COMINGS AND GOINGS OF ALL THEIR ACQUAINTANCE SHE WONDERED WITH LITTLE INTERMISSION WHAT COULD BE THE REASON OF IT WAS SURE THERE MUST BE SOME BAD NEWS
I WOULD NOT ASK SUCH A QUESTION FOR THE WORLD SUPPOSING IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE NOT ENGAGED WHAT DISTRESS WOULD NOT SUCH AN ENQUIRY INFLICT AT ANY RATE IT WOULD BE MOST UNGENEROUS I SHOULD NEVER DESERVE HER CONFIDENCE AGAIN AFTER FORCING FROM HER A CONFESSION
WHICH OUGHT TO BE IRREGULAR AND RUGGED AND DISTANT OBJECTS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE INDISTINCT THROUGH THE SOFT MEDIUM OF A HAZY ATMOSPHERE YOU MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH ADMIRATION AS I CAN HONESTLY GIVE I CALL IT A VERY FINE COUNTRY
AND UNDER MANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT NATURALLY WOULD DURING A FOUR YEARS ENGAGEMENT
YOUR COMPETENCE AND MY WEALTH ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE I DARE SAY AND WITHOUT THEM AS THE WORLD GOES NOW WE SHALL BOTH AGREE THAT EVERY KIND OF EXTERNAL COMFORT MUST BE WANTING
AND HER LIKING ME IS EVERY THING YOU SHAN'T TALK ME OUT OF MY SATISFACTION
AND WHILE HIS LOOKS OF ANXIOUS SOLICITUDE ON MARIANNE'S FEELING IN HER HEAD AND THROAT THE BEGINNING OF A HEAVY COLD BECAUSE UNEXPRESSED BY WORDS ENTIRELY ESCAPED THE LATTER LADY'S OBSERVATION SHE COULD DISCOVER IN THEM THE QUICK FEELINGS
HUNTERS REPEATED EDWARD BUT WHY MUST YOU HAVE HUNTERS EVERY BODY DOES NOT HUNT MARIANNE COLOURED AS SHE REPLIED BUT MOST PEOPLE DO I WISH SAID MARGARET STRIKING OUT A NOVEL THOUGHT
THE MOUNTAIN ASH AND THE ACACIA AND A THICK SCREEN OF THEM ALTOGETHER INTERSPERSED WITH TALL LOMBARDY POPLARS SHUT OUT THE OFFICES MARIANNE ENTERED THE HOUSE WITH A HEART SWELLING WITH EMOTION
ALWAYS OUT OF HUMOUR ELINOR WAS NOT INCLINED AFTER A LITTLE OBSERVATION TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR BEING SO GENUINELY AND UNAFFECTEDLY ILL NATURED OR ILL BRED AS HE WISHED TO APPEAR HIS TEMPER MIGHT
WHERE THEY FOUND ONLY WILLOUGHBY WHO WAS LEANING AGAINST THE MANTEL PIECE WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THEM HE TURNED ROUND ON THEIR COMING IN AND HIS COUNTENANCE SHEWED THAT HE STRONGLY PARTOOK OF THE EMOTION WHICH OVER POWERED MARIANNE
AND CONFIRMING HER OWN THEIR JOURNEY WAS SAFELY PERFORMED THE SECOND DAY BROUGHT THEM INTO THE CHERISHED OR THE PROHIBITED COUNTY OF SOMERSET FOR AS SUCH WAS IT DWELT ON BY TURNS IN MARIANNE'S IMAGINATION
NO ANSWERED ELINOR WITH A SMILE WHICH CONCEALED VERY AGITATED FEELINGS ON SUCH A SUBJECT I CERTAINLY WILL NOT YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT MY OPINION WOULD HAVE NO WEIGHT WITH YOU UNLESS IT WERE ON THE SIDE OF YOUR WISHES
BUT THIS PLACE WILL ALWAYS HAVE ONE CLAIM OF MY AFFECTION WHICH NO OTHER CAN POSSIBLY SHARE MISSUS DASHWOOD LOOKED WITH PLEASURE AT MARIANNE WHOSE FINE EYES WERE FIXED SO EXPRESSIVELY ON WILLOUGHBY AS PLAINLY DENOTED HOW WELL SHE UNDERSTOOD HIM
HER DESIGN OF IMPROVING THE COTTAGE IN THE SPRING HE WARMLY OPPOSED EVERY ALTERATION OF A PLACE WHICH AFFECTION HAD ESTABLISHED AS PERFECT WITH HIM WHAT HE EXCLAIMED IMPROVE THIS DEAR COTTAGE NO THAT I WILL NEVER CONSENT TO
MARIANNE ASKED EDWARD IF HE CAME DIRECTLY FROM LONDON NO HE HAD BEEN IN DEVONSHIRE A FORTNIGHT A FORTNIGHT SHE REPEATED SURPRISED AT HIS BEING SO LONG IN THE SAME COUNTY WITH ELINOR WITHOUT SEEING HER BEFORE
FOR LADY MIDDLETON'S DELIGHTED WITH MISSUS DASHWOOD SO WE SHALL BE A GOOD DEAL IN HARLEY STREET I DARE SAY AND EDWARD SPENDS HALF HIS TIME WITH HIS SISTER BESIDES LADY MIDDLETON AND MISSUS FERRARS WILL VISIT NOW
ASKED ELINOR NOT AT ALL I NEVER SAW HIM BUT I FANCY HE IS VERY UNLIKE HIS BROTHER SILLY AND A GREAT COXCOMB A GREAT COXCOMB REPEATED MISS STEELE
ELINOR WAS AGAIN OBLIGED TO DECLINE HER INVITATION AND BY CHANGING THE SUBJECT PUT A STOP TO HER ENTREATIES SHE THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT AS THEY LIVED IN THE SAME COUNTY
TELL ME THAT NOT ONLY YOUR HOUSE WILL REMAIN THE SAME BUT THAT I SHALL EVER FIND YOU AND YOURS AS UNCHANGED AS YOUR DWELLING AND THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS CONSIDER ME WITH THE KINDNESS WHICH HAS MADE EVERYTHING BELONGING TO YOU SO DEAR TO ME THE PROMISE WAS READILY GIVEN
AND I REALLY BELIEVE HE HAS THE MOST DELICATE CONSCIENCE IN THE WORLD THE MOST SCRUPULOUS IN PERFORMING EVERY ENGAGEMENT HOWEVER MINUTE
OR TO ALLOW HER TO DERIVE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM A PREFERENCE ONLY GIVEN HER BECAUSE HER REAL SITUATION WAS UNKNOWN BUT THAT IT WAS SO HAD NOT ONLY BEEN DECLARED BY LUCY'S EYES AT THE TIME BUT WAS DECLARED OVER AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING MORE OPENLY
SHOULD LEAVE HER AND LEAVE HER PERHAPS FOR MONTHS WITHOUT TELLING HER OF HIS AFFECTION THAT THEY SHOULD PART WITHOUT A MUTUAL EXCHANGE OF CONFIDENCE I CONFESS REPLIED ELINOR
TO MARIANNE INDEED THE MEETING BETWEEN EDWARD AND HER SISTER WAS BUT A CONTINUATION OF THAT UNACCOUNTABLE COLDNESS WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN OBSERVED AT NORLAND IN THEIR MUTUAL BEHAVIOUR
BUT HE LIVED AT AN EXPENSE TO WHICH THAT INCOME COULD HARDLY BE EQUAL AND HE HAD HIMSELF OFTEN COMPLAINED OF HIS POVERTY BUT FOR THIS STRANGE KIND OF SECRECY MAINTAINED BY THEM RELATIVE TO THEIR ENGAGEMENT WHICH IN FACT CONCEALED NOTHING AT ALL
MISSUS DASHWOOD'S VISIT TO LADY MIDDLETON TOOK PLACE THE NEXT DAY AND TWO OF HER DAUGHTERS WENT WITH HER BUT MARIANNE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM BEING OF THE PARTY UNDER SOME TRIFLING PRETEXT OF EMPLOYMENT
TO DO IT WELL THAT SHE FORCED HERSELF AFTER A MOMENT'S RECOLLECTION TO WELCOME HIM WITH A LOOK AND MANNER THAT WERE ALMOST EASY AND ALMOST OPEN AND ANOTHER STRUGGLE ANOTHER EFFORT STILL IMPROVED THEM
BUT I AM AFRAID MY PRACTICE IS MUCH MORE ON YOUR SISTER'S
EDWARD SAW ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND NOT ONLY THE MEANING OF OTHERS BUT SUCH OF MARIANNE'S EXPRESSIONS AS HAD PUZZLED HIM BEFORE AND WHEN THEIR VISITORS LEFT THEM HE WENT IMMEDIATELY ROUND HER AND SAID IN A WHISPER I HAVE BEEN GUESSING SHALL I TELL YOU MY GUESS
AND SO WE BEGAN TALKING OF MY BROTHER AND SISTER AND ONE THING AND ANOTHER AND I SAID TO HIM SO COLONEL THERE IS A NEW FAMILY COME TO BARTON COTTAGE I HEAR
AND ABSENT HIMSELF FROM DEVONSHIRE FOR A WHILE YOU WILL TELL ME I KNOW THAT THIS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAPPENED BUT I WILL LISTEN TO NO CAVIL UNLESS YOU CAN POINT OUT ANY OTHER METHOD OF UNDERSTANDING THE AFFAIR AS SATISFACTORY AT THIS
AND NEVER LOOKED AT ME IN A PLEASANT WAY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF I HAD BEEN TREATED IN THAT FORBIDDING SORT OF WAY
PERHAPS MISS MARIANNE CRIED LUCY EAGER TO TAKE SOME REVENGE ON HER
THAT NO ONE CAN EVER BE IN LOVE MORE THAN ONCE IN THEIR LIFE YOUR OPINION ON THAT POINT IS UNCHANGED I PRESUME UNDOUBTEDLY AT MY TIME OF LIFE OPINIONS ARE TOLERABLY FIXED IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT I SHOULD NOW SEE OR HEAR ANY THING TO CHANGE THEM
THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD HAVE GAINED A SMILE FROM HER BUT SHE DISPERSED HER TEARS TO SMILE ON HIM
I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE IT OF ALL THINGS THE WESTONS WILL BE WITH US AND IT WILL BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL YOU CANNOT THINK WHAT A SWEET PLACE CLEVELAND IS AND WE ARE SO GAY NOW FOR MISTER PALMER IS ALWAYS GOING ABOUT THE COUNTRY CANVASSING AGAINST THE ELECTION
OTHERWISE LONDON WOULD HAVE NO CHARMS FOR ME I HAVE NOT SPIRITS FOR IT ELINOR WAS SOON CALLED TO THE CARD TABLE BY THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST RUBBER AND THE CONFIDENTIAL DISCOURSE OF THE TWO LADIES WAS THEREFORE AT AN END
THOUGH MARIANNE WAS THEN GIVING THEM THE POWERFUL PROTECTION OF A VERY MAGNIFICENT CONCERTO I WILL HONESTLY TELL YOU OF ONE SCHEME WHICH HAS LATELY COME INTO MY HEAD FOR BRINGING MATTERS TO BEAR
IT IS BUT NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER AS WELL AS OURSELVES MARIANNE LOOKED AT HER STEADILY AND SAID
TO COMPREHEND ALL THE DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST HAVE PERPLEXED THE ENGAGEMENT AND RETARDED THE MARRIAGE OF EDWARD AND HERSELF HAD HE BEEN OTHERWISE FREE AND SHE HAD SEEN ALMOST ENOUGH TO BE THANKFUL FOR HER OWN SAKE
BUT AS IT WAS SHE ONLY LEARNED FROM SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT LOOKS HOW FAR THEIR PENETRATION FOUNDED ON MARGARET'S INSTRUCTIONS EXTENDED SIR JOHN NEVER CAME TO THE DASHWOODS WITHOUT EITHER INVITING THEM TO DINE AT THE PARK THE NEXT DAY OR TO DRINK TEA WITH THEM THAT EVENING
AND NO REASON IN THE WORLD TO THINK ILL OF TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MOTIVES UNANSWERABLE IN THEMSELVES THOUGH UNAVOIDABLY SECRET FOR A WHILE AND AFTER ALL WHAT IS IT YOU SUSPECT HIM OF
AS HE MUST FEEL HIMSELF TO BE TO MISSUS JENNINGS AND CHARLOTTE FOR THE REST OF HIS CHARACTER AND HABITS THEY WERE MARKED AS FAR AS ELINOR COULD PERCEIVE WITH NO TRAITS AT ALL UNUSUAL IN HIS SEX AND TIME OF LIFE HE WAS NICE IN HIS EATING
MARIANNE LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AT EDWARD WITH COMPASSION AT HER SISTER
HE COLOURED VERY DEEPLY AND GIVING A MOMENTARY GLANCE AT ELINOR REPLIED YES IT IS MY SISTER'S HAIR THE SETTING ALWAYS CASTS A DIFFERENT SHADE ON IT YOU KNOW ELINOR HAD MET HIS EYE AND LOOKED CONSCIOUS LIKEWISE
HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE AVOIDED BY THE FAMILY IN GENERAL SOON PROCURED HERSELF A BOOK NOTHING WAS WANTING ON MISSUS PALMER'S SIDE THAT CONSTANT AND FRIENDLY GOOD HUMOUR COULD DO TO MAKE THEM FEEL THEMSELVES WELCOME
FANCYING PEOPLE SO MUCH MORE GAY OR GRAVE OR INGENIOUS OR STUPID THAN THEY REALLY ARE AND I CAN HARDLY TELL WHY OR IN WHAT THE DECEPTION ORIGINATED
BUT HITHERTO THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS PREFERENCE SEEMED VERY UNCERTAIN AND THE RESERVEDNESS OF HIS MANNER TOWARDS HER CONTRADICTED ONE MOMENT WHAT A MORE ANIMATED LOOK HAD INTIMATED THE PRECEDING ONE
ELINOR WAS PREVENTED FROM MAKING ANY REPLY TO THIS CIVIL TRIUMPH BY THE DOOR'S BEING THROWN OPEN THE SERVANT'S ANNOUNCING MISTER FERRARS AND EDWARD'S IMMEDIATELY WALKING IN
SUCH CARELESSNESS OF THE FUTURE AS YOU ATTRIBUTE TO HIM YOU MUST REMEMBER MY DEAR MOTHER THAT I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THIS MATTER AS CERTAIN I HAVE HAD MY DOUBTS I CONFESS BUT THEY ARE FAINTER THAN THEY WERE
TO BE MORE THOROUGHLY GOOD NATURED OR MORE DETERMINED TO BE HAPPY THAN MISSUS PALMER THE STUDIED INDIFFERENCE INSOLENCE AND DISCONTENT OF HER HUSBAND GAVE HER NO PAIN AND WHEN HE SCOLDED OR ABUSED HER SHE WAS HIGHLY DIVERTED
NO PRIDE NO HAUTEUR AND YOUR SISTER JUST THE SAME ALL SWEETNESS AND AFFABILITY ELINOR WISHED TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT LUCY STILL PRESSED HER TO OWN THAT SHE HAD REASON FOR HER HAPPINESS AND ELINOR WAS OBLIGED TO GO ON
WILLOUGHBY'S BEHAVIOUR IN TAKING LEAVE OF THEM HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND AFFECTATION OF CHEERFULNESS AND ABOVE ALL HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT HER MOTHER'S INVITATION A BACKWARDNESS SO UNLIKE A LOVER SO UNLIKE HIMSELF GREATLY DISTURBED HER
WHILE HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN IT APPEARED SO IMPERFECT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY SHE WISHED IT WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT HE STILL DISTINGUISHED HER BY THE SAME AFFECTION WHICH ONCE SHE HAD FELT NO DOUBT OF INSPIRING
SOME OF IT AT LEAST MY LOOSE CASH WOULD CERTAINLY BE EMPLOYED IN IMPROVING MY COLLECTION OF MUSIC AND BOOKS AND THE BULK OF YOUR FORTUNE WOULD BE LAID OUT IN ANNUITIES ON THE AUTHORS OR THEIR HEIRS NO EDWARD I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO WITH IT
HOW STRANGE SAID MARIANNE TO HERSELF AS SHE WALKED ON
AND SO DOES MISTER PALMER TOO I AM SURE THOUGH WE COULD NOT GET HIM TO OWN IT LAST NIGHT MISSUS PALMER'S INFORMATION RESPECTING WILLOUGHBY WAS NOT VERY MATERIAL BUT ANY TESTIMONY IN HIS FAVOUR HOWEVER SMALL WAS PLEASING TO HER
NO PROFESSION AND NO ASSURANCE YOU MAY FIND IT A DIFFICULT MATTER I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT IT I HAVE NO WISH TO BE DISTINGUISHED AND HAVE EVERY REASON TO HOPE I NEVER SHALL THANK HEAVEN I CANNOT BE FORCED INTO GENIUS AND ELOQUENCE
TO WHICH BOTH OF THEM SUBMITTED WITHOUT ANY RELUCTANCE FOR NOTHING HAD BEEN SAID ON EITHER SIDE TO MAKE THEM DISLIKE EACH OTHER LESS THAN THEY HAD DONE BEFORE AND ELINOR SAT DOWN TO THE CARD TABLE WITH THE MELANCHOLY PERSUASION THAT EDWARD WAS NOT ONLY WITHOUT AFFECTION FOR THE PERSON WHO WAS TO BE HIS WIFE
WITH A MORE WARM THOUGH LESS PUBLIC ASSURANCE FROM JOHN TO ELINOR OF THE PROMPTITUDE WITH WHICH HE SHOULD COME TO SEE HER AT DELAFORD WAS ALL THAT FORETOLD ANY MEETING IN THE COUNTRY
AND TOLERABLY EARLY IN THE DAY THE TWO PARTIES FROM HANOVER SQUARE AND BERKELEY STREET SET OUT FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES TO MEET BY APPOINTMENT ON THE ROAD FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF CHARLOTTE AND HER CHILD
AND HER MOTHER WHO CONCLUDED THAT A PROMISE HAD BEEN MADE BY WILLOUGHBY THE NIGHT BEFORE OF CALLING ON HER
AND I WILL HOPE THAT HE HAS BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE WILLOUGHBY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM AT ONCE SECRECY MAY BE ADVISABLE BUT STILL I CANNOT HELP WONDERING AT ITS BEING PRACTICED BY HIM
THE MORNING WAS FINE AND DRY AND MARIANNE IN HER PLAN OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD HAD NOT CALCULATED FOR ANY CHANGE OF WEATHER DURING THEIR STAY AT CLEVELAND WITH GREAT SURPRISE THEREFORE
SHE PLAYED OVER EVERY FAVOURITE SONG THAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO PLAY TO WILLOUGHBY EVERY AIR IN WHICH THEIR VOICES HAD BEEN OFTENEST JOINED AND SAT AT THE INSTRUMENT GAZING ON EVERY LINE OF MUSIC THAT HE HAD WRITTEN OUT FOR HER
WHEN EDWARD INTERRUPTED HER BY SAYING YOU MUST NOT ENQUIRE TOO FAR MARIANNE REMEMBER I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE IN THE PICTURESQUE AND I SHALL OFFEND YOU BY MY IGNORANCE AND WANT OF TASTE IF WE COME TO PARTICULARS
DO NOT BLAME HIM HOWEVER FOR DEPARTING FROM HIS CHARACTER WHERE THE DEVIATION IS NECESSARY BUT YOU REALLY DO ADMIT THE JUSTICE OF WHAT I HAVE SAID IN HIS DEFENCE I AM HAPPY AND HE IS ACQUITTED NOT ENTIRELY
AND WHO IS WILLOUGHBY SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE TO MISS DASHWOOD BY WHOM HE WAS SITTING SHE GAVE HIM A BRIEF REPLY
AND FROM OUR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS IN LIFE FROM HIS BEING SO MUCH MORE IN THE WORLD THAN ME AND OUR CONTINUAL SEPARATION
ENDEAVOURED TO SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE DISCOURSE WITH HIM BY TALKING OF THEIR PRESENT RESIDENCE
I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO PUT AN END TO YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH EDWARD FERRARS IT WILL BE MORE FOR THE HAPPINESS OF BOTH OF YOU I SHOULD RESOLVE UPON DOING IT IMMEDIATELY ELINOR BLUSHED FOR THE INSINCERITY OF EDWARD'S FUTURE WIFE
GREATNESS WILL NOT MAKE ME SO STRANGE THAT IT WOULD CRIED MARIANNE WHAT HAVE WEALTH OR GRANDEUR TO DO WITH HAPPINESS
WHOM HE HAD SEEN AMIDST THE HOST AT ITS ENTERING INTO THE BURG SO HE WANDERED AWAY THENCE THINKING ON WHAT HE SHOULD DO TILL THE SUN WAS SET AND HE HAD COME INTO THE OPEN SPACE UNDERNEATH THE WALLS AND HAD GONE ALONG IT TILL HE CAME TO THE EAST GATE
AS HE SAW WERE CLAD OTHERWISE THAN THE DARKER WOMEN THEIR HEADS UNCOIFED UNCOVERED SAVE FOR SOME GARLAND OR SILKEN BAND THEIR GOWNS YELLOW LIKE WHEAT STRAW BUT GAILY EMBROIDERED SLEEVELESS WITHAL AND SHORT
TO MORROW IS A NEW DAY AND FAIR IS THE WOODLAND HALL OF SUMMER TIDE NEITHER SHALL WATER FAIL US BUT AS TO VICTUAL I WOT NOT SAVE THAT WE HAVE NONE THE LADY LAUGHED AND SAID TO RALPH

FOR THOU ART MY PRISONER TO BE KEPT OR RANSOMED OR SET FREE AS I WILL BUT MY WILL IS THAT THOU SHALT NOT HAVE THINE ARMOUR AND WEAPONS AND THERE IS A CAUSE FOR THIS WHICH MAYHAPPEN I WILL TELL THEE HEREAFTER
AND ROSE UP HASTILY AND STOOD A LITTLE ALOOF AGAIN NOW RALPH SAT UP AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND WHEN HE SAW THE LADY HE FIRST BLUSHED RED AND THEN TURNED VERY PALE FOR THE FULL LIFE WAS IN HIM AGAIN AND HE KNEW HER AND LOVE DREW STRONGLY AT HIS HEART STRINGS

YOUNG MAN CANST THOU HEAR MY WORDS RALPH SMILED FEEBLY AND NODDED A YEA SAY DOST THOU LOVE THY LIFE THEN SAID THE KNIGHT RALPH FOUND SPEECH AND SAID FAINTLY YEA
SO HE WORE THROUGH THE REMNANT OF THE DAY HOWSO HE MIGHT WITHOUT GOING OUT ADOORS AGAIN AND THE CARLINE CAME AND SPAKE WITH HIM BUT WHATEVER HE ASKED HER ABOUT THE LADY SHE WOULD NOT TELL AUGHT OF ANY IMPORT
THAT IT SHOULD BE SO ALL THE MORE AS I HAVE A GUESS CONCERNING WHAT HE IS AND A FORESEEING MAN MIGHT THINK THAT LUCK SHOULD GO WITH HIM THEREWITH HE TURNED TO RALPH AND SAID HOW SAY YE FAIR SIR
AND WAS A WOMAN BELIKE THEN HE BETTERED HIS PACE AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO CAME SO NEAR THAT HE COULD SEE THE MEN CLEARLY THAT THEY WERE CLAD IN KNIGHTLY WAR GEAR AND WERE LAYING ON GREAT STROKES SO THAT THE STILL PLACE RANG WITH THE CLATTER AS FOR THE WOMAN
BUT SET OFF RUNNING AT THEIR BEST TOWARD THE WOOD AFORESAID WHICH CROWNED THE SLOPE LEADING UP FROM THE GRANGE
WHO WOULD ELSE HAVE BEEN TORMENTED TO DEATH BY THE BURGERS WELL SAID THE KNIGHT PERCHANCE THOU HAST MORE MERCY THAN I LOOKED FOR OF THEE THOUGH I MISDOUBT THEE THAT THOU MAYST YET PRAY ME OR SOME OTHER TO SLAY HIM FOR THEE
THEN SHALL SHE SHOW ME THE WAY TO THE WELL AT THE WORLD'S END AND I SHALL DRINK THEREOF AND NEVER GROW OLD EVEN AS SHE ENDURETH IN YOUTH AND SHE SHALL LOVE ME FOR EVER AND I HER FOR EVER SO HE THOUGHT
FOOT MEN WITH BILLS SOME AND SOME WITH BOWS AND ALL ARMED KNIGHTS AND SERGEANTS A HORSEBACK SO STREAMED IN THESE WEAPONED MEN TILL RALPH SAW THAT IT WAS A GREAT HOST THAT WAS ENTERING THE BURG AND HIS HEART ROSE WITHIN HIM
RALPH SAID NOUGHT BUT WAXED SHAMEFACED AS HE DEEMED THAT THE PRIEST EYED HIM CURIOUSLY AT LAST HE SAID I WILL ASK THEE A QUESTION IN TURN FATHER YEA SAID THE PRIEST SAID RALPH
IT IS HER WAY HERE IN THE SUMMER TIDE TO BATHE HER IN YONDER POOL UP THE WATER AND IT WAS THE SAME POOL WHEREIN RALPH HAD BATHED AND SHE HATH ME AND MY NIECE AND TWO OTHER WOMEN TO HOLD UP THE SILKEN CLOTH BETWIXT HER BODY AND THE WORLD SO THAT I HAVE SEEN HER AS GOD MADE HER
THAT HE MIGHT BE BUT THAT HE WAS ALREADY OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE DRY TREE AND MOST LIKE WOULD GO STRAIGHT THENCE TO THEIR STRONGHOLD SO HE SPAKE AS SOBERLY AS THE TALL MAN HAD DONE SINCE YE GIVE ME THE CHOICE FAIR SIR
AND MOREOVER HE IS MANY YARDS AWAY FROM ME AND SILVERFAX SO BEFORE THOU ART IN THE SADDLE WHERE SHALL I BE YEA FOR THE KNIGHT WAS HANDLING HIS ANLACE THOU MAYST CAST IT AND PERADVENTURE MAYST HIT SILVERFAX AND NOT ME
WAS BUT THE VERY SOOTH BUT THE KNIGHT SPAKE YOUNG MAN THOU HAST FOUGHT WITH ME THOU KNOWEST NOT WHEREFORE AND GRIM WAS MY MOOD WHEN THOU MADEST THINE ONSET
AND GIRT HIS SWORD TO HIS SIDE AND WENT FORTH A FOOT AS BEFORE HE CROSSED THE RIVER BY A WIDE FORD AND STEPPING STONES SOMEWHAT BELOW THE POOL WHEREIN HE HAD BATHED ON THAT FIRST DAY AND ALREADY BY THEN HE HAD GOT SO FAR
AND ASKED HIM WHITHER HE WOULD SAID THE PRIEST I AM FOR THE LITTLE PLAIN AND THE LAND OF ABUNDANCE WHENCE ART THOU MY SON AND WHITHER WILT THOU FROM THAT VERY LAND I COME SAID RALPH AND AS TO WHITHER
SHE SPAKE NOT BUT STOOD QUIETLY LOOKING ON HIM NOT UNKINDLY WHILE A WIND CAME UP FROM THE WATER AND PLAYED WITH A FEW LIGHT LOCKS OF HAIR THAT HUNG DOWN FROM THAT RUDDY CROWN AND BLEW HER RAIMENT FROM HER FEET AND WRAPPED IT CLOSE ROUND HER LIMBS
RALPH SPAKE AFTER A WHILE AND SAID TELL ME IS SHE GOOD AND A GOOD WOMAN
SO THAT HE STIRRED SOMEWHAT AND THE COLOUR CAME INTO HIS FACE A LITTLE THEN SHE BADE GATHER STORE OF BRACKEN FOR A BED FOR THE BLACK KNIGHT AND RALPH BESTIRRED HIMSELF THEREIN BUT THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN SAT LOOKING AT THE LADY AS SHE BUSIED HERSELF WITH HIS FRIEND
AND RAN TO THE OLD WOMAN AND CRIED OUT TO HER IS SHE COME IS SHE COME THE CARLINE LAUGHED AND SAID NAY SHE IS NOT BUT THOU ART COME PRAISE BE TO THE SAINTS BUT WHAT AILETH THEE NAY FEAR NOT SHE SHALL COME AT LAST
AND WHAT SHE WOULD SAY TO HIM AND HOW HE SHOULD ANSWER HER TILL AT LAST THE NIGHT CAME AND HE WENT TO HIS BED AND SLEPT FOR THE VERY WEARINESS OF HIS LONGING WHEN THE NEW DAY CAME HE AROSE AND WENT INTO THE HALL AND FOUND THE CARLINE THERE WHO SAID TO HIM
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE THE LEECHCRAFT OF THE LADY MEANWHILE SHE WENT TO RALPH AND STOOD BY HIM WHO NOW BEGAN TO STIR AGAIN AND SHE KNELT DOWN BY HIM AND KISSED HIS FACE GENTLY
WHEREWITH WILT THOU REWARD ME THEN ONCE MORE RALPH HEARD THE VOICE WHICH HE REMEMBERED SO SWEET AMIDST PERIL AND BATTLE AFORETIME AS SHE SAID AS COLDLY AS THE KNIGHT I BADE THEE NOT
AND RALPH TARRIED NOT TO GET AWAY FROM HER SPITEFUL BABBLE WHICH HE NOW PARTLY UNDERSTOOD AND THAT ALL THOSE YELLOW CLAD DAMSELS WERE THRALLS TO THE FOLK OF THE BURG
SO THAT THE BLOOD SPRANG AND FELL ON FIERCELY ENOUGH SMITING TO RIGHT AND LEFT
THE STREETS OF THE BURG OF THE FOUR FRITHS HE WENT ABOUT THE STREETS AND FOUND THEM ALL MUCH LIKE TO THE ONE WHICH THEY HAD ENTERED BY THE NORTH GATE HE SAW NO POOR OR WRETCHED HOUSES
THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN STOOD UP OVER HIM BESIDE THE LADY
THE TALL MAN NODDED HIS HEAD AND AS THE YOUTH DREW RIGHT BACK NIGH TO THE THICKET SPAKE TO RALPH AGAIN FAIR SIR WE GRANT THINE ASKING
WELL DEEMEST THOU THAT I HAVE HAD MORE MEN THAN ONE TO LOVE ME I KNOW NOT MOTHER SAID RALPH WHO COULD SCARCE HOLD HIMSELF PATIENT THERE NOW QUOTH THE CARLINE LOOK AT MY DAMSEL SHE IS NOT MY DAUGHTER BUT MY BROTHER'S
BUT THOSE NOTHING TO THE POINT THEN THE LADY TOOK HER GAY EMBROIDERED CLOAK WHICH LAY AT THE FOOT OF THE OAK TREE AND CAST IT OVER HIM AND AS RALPH DEEMED
AND A LITTLE STIR OF BLENDED SOUNDS THAT IT WAS HARD ON DAWNING AND EVEN THEREWITH HE HEARD THE CHALLENGE OF THE WARDERS ON THE WALLS AND THEIR CRYING OF THE HOUR AND THE CHIMES OF THE BELFRY RANG CLEAR AND LOUD AND SEEMING CLOSE ABOVE HIM
HE SHALL COME WITH ME WILL HE NILL HE UNARMED AND AS A PRISONER AND THE SPOIL OF MY VALIANCY AND HE LAUGHED NOT ALTOGETHER IN BITTERNESS BUT AS IF SOME JOY WERE RISING IN HIS HEART NOW MY QUEEN SAID HE
AND THY DOUBTING AND IF THOU WILT DO AFTER MY REDE THOU WILT CERTAINLY GO INTO THE WOOD TO MORROW AND SEE WHAT MAY BEFALL AND INDEED AND IN SOOTH THOU WILT LEAVE BEHIND THEE A TRUSTY FRIEND HE LOOKED ON HER KINDLY AND SMILED AND SAID
AND FOUND THE SADDLE BAGS ON HIM AND TOOK FROM THEM BREAD AND FLESH AND A FLASK OF GOOD WINE AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE LADY WHO LAUGHED AND SAID THOU ART A GOOD SEEKER AND NO ILL FINDER THEN SHE GAVE THE WOUNDED MAN TO DRINK OF THE WINE
RALPH STAGGERED UP TO HIS FEET BUT WAS SO FEEBLE STILL THAT HE SANK DOWN AGAIN AND MUTTERED I MAY NOT I AM SICK AND FAINT AND THEREWITH SWOONED AWAY AGAIN BUT THE KNIGHT STOOD A WHILE LEANING ON HIS SWORD
EVEN SUCH A CARLINE WAS SITTING ON A CLEAN WHITE DOOR STEP ON THE SUNNY SIDE SOMEWHAT SHADED BY A TALL ROSE LAUREL TREE IN A GREAT TUB AND SHE SANG AS SHE SAT SPINNING AND RALPH STAYED TO LISTEN IN HIS IDLE MOOD
THEN GREW RALPH SHAMEFACED AND TURNED AWAY FROM HER AND MISCALLED HIMSELF FOR A FOOL AND A DASTARD
AND KEEN SIGHTED AS HE WAS COULD MAKE OUT THAT THREE MEN WERE ON THE HITHER SIDE OF THE OAK TREES AND ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THEM WAS A WHITE HORSE THITHERWARD THEN HE MADE STEALING FROM BUSH TO BUSH SINCE HE DEEMED THAT HE NEEDED NOT BE SEEN OF MEN WHO MIGHT BE FOES
WELL SINCE THOU WILT NOT HAVE THIS YOUNGLING SLAIN I MAY DEEM AT LEAST THAT HE IS NO DEVIL OF THY MAKING ELSE WOULDST THOU BE GLAD OF HIS SLAYING SO THAT HE MIGHT BE OUT OF THE PATH OF THEE SO A MAN HE IS
O NO I GRIEVE AT IT FOR ALL THAT I HAD SUCH GOOD CAUSE TO HATE HIM HE SAID MY OWN HEART MY OWN HEART HALF OF MY HEART BIDDETH ME SLAY THEE WHO HAST MADE ME SLAY HIM WHAT WILT THOU GIVE ME
FOR THESE WOODLAND WAYS ARE SOME WHAT BLIND SAID THE PRIEST
THUS THEY ABODE FOR ABOUT THE SPACE OF ONE MINUTE AND MEANWHILE THE BIG MAN ROSE UP ON ONE KNEE AND STEADIED HIM WITH HIS SWORD FOR A MOMENT OF TIME AND THE BLADE WAS BLOODY FROM THE POINT HALF WAY UP TO THE HILT
AND SHE STRETCHED OUT HER ARM OVER THE WOUNDED MAN WITH THE FINGERS POINTING DOWN THE WATER AND REDDENED WITHAL AS IF SHE FELT THE HEARTS GREEDINESS OF THE TWO MEN WHO WERE LOOKING ON HER BEAUTY THE BIG KNIGHT SIGHED AND SAID
HE KNEW ALSO THAT IT WAS ROGER WHO HAD LED HIM INTO THIS TRAP ALTHOUGH HE DEEMED IT DONE WITH NO MALICE AGAINST HIM SO HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IF HE WENT WITH ROGER HE BUT WENT A ROUNDABOUT ROAD TO THE DRY TREE
AND IN SOOTH HE SMILED TO HIMSELF THEN WITH A BEATING HEART
IN SOOTH MOTHER I DEEM THOU ART BUT RIGHT THOUGH IT BE HARD FOR ME TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE TO WHICH IN A WAY MY LADY HATH BIDDEN ME YET I WILL DO THY BIDDING HEREIN
AND HE COULD NOT MEET THE OLD WOMAN'S EYES AS SHE SPAKE THUS AND THE MAIDEN TOOK HERSELF OUT OF EARSHOT AT THE FIRST WORDS OF THE CARLINE HEREOF
HE SHALL SPRING AWAY WITH ME THOU WOTTEST HOW WELL I KNOW ALL THE WAYS OF THE WOODLAND AND I TELL THEE THAT THE WAYS BEHIND ME TO THE DRY TREE BE ALL SAFE AND OPEN AND THAT BEYOND THE GLIDING RIVER I SHALL COME ON ROGER OF THE ROPEWALK AND HIS MEN
THIS IS THE BARGAIN TO BE STRUCK BETWEEN US EVEN NOW THOU WOULDST NOT REFRAIN FROM SLAYING THIS YOUNG MAN UNLESS PERCHANCE HE SHOULD SWEAR TO DEPART FROM US AND AS FOR ME I WOULD NOT GO BACK WITH THEE TO SUNHOME
KNOW THIS THAT WHATEVER ELSE SHE MAY BE SHE IS A RIGHT HOLY WOMAN OR HAST THOU PERCHANCE HEARD ANY EVIL TALES CONCERNING HER NOW RALPH WAS CONFUSED AT HIS WORD AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO SAY
RALPH CAME FORTH FROM THE BUSHES WITH HIS DRAWN SWORD IN HIS HAND AND EVEN THEREWITH WHAT WITH THE TWO KNIGHTS BEING BOTH LOW UPON THE EARTH WHAT WITH THE WOMAN HERSELF COMING FROM OUT THE SHADOW OF THE OAK BOUGHS AND TURNING HER TOWARD RALPH HE SAW HER CLEARLY
AFTER A WHILE AMONG THE WARRIORS CAME HERDS OF NEAT AND FLOCKS OF SHEEP AND STRINGS OF HORSES OF THE SPOIL WHICH THE HOST HAD LIFTED AND THEN WAINS FILLED SOME WITH WEAPONS AND WAR GEAR
AND STILL IS SO THAT NEVER BUT ONCE WILT THOU BE NIGHER THY DEATH THAN THOU HAST BEEN THIS HOUR BUT NOW I HAVE GIVEN THEE LIFE BECAUSE OF THE ASKING OF THIS LADY AND THEREWITH I GIVE THEE LEAVE TO COME THY WAYS WITH US
NOW WILT THOU TELL ME BEFORE I ASK THE NEXT QUESTION WHO WILL BE THOSE WAR TAKEN THRALLS WHOM EVEN NOW I SAW BROUGHT INTO THE BURG BY THE HOST OF WHAT NATION BE THEY AND OF WHAT KINDRED
TWISTED ABOUT THEIR HEADS THESE HE TOOK FOR MERCHANTS AS THEY WERE OFTENEST STANDING IN AND ABOUT THE BOOTHS AND SHOPS WHEREOF
RALPH SHOOK HIS HEAD AND KNIT HIS BROWS AND SAID I WILL NOT YEA SAID THE KNIGHT THOU WILT NOT LIVE THEN MUST I SHAPE ME TO THY HUMOUR STAND ON THY FEET AND FIGHT IT OUT
AND LOOKING DOWN ON HIM NOT UNKINDLY THEN HE TURNED ABOUT TO THE LADY BUT LO SHE HAD LEFT HIS SIDE SHE HAD GLIDED AWAY AND GOT TO HER HORSE WHICH WAS TETHERED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OAK TREE AND HAD LOOSED HIM AND MOUNTED HIM
TO ASK OF HIS HORSE SINCE HE DURST NOT ASK OF HIS LIFE SO THEY WENT ON SILENTLY TILL THEY WERE OUT OF THE GREAT PLACE AND CAME INTO A NARROW STREET
BUT YET I WILL SAY ONE WORD TO THEE ERE WE SUNDER TO WIT THAT TO MY MIND THE HOLY LADY WILL LOVE NO ONE BUT THE SAINTS OF HEAVEN SAVE IT BE SOME MAN WITH WHOM ALL WOMEN ARE IN LOVE THEREWITH HE TURNED AWAY SUDDENLY
HOW RALPH DEPARTED FROM THE BURG OF THE FOUR FRITHS HIMSEEMED HE HAD SCARCE BEEN ASLEEP A MINUTE ERE AWOKE WITH A SOUND OF SOMEONE SAYING SOFTLY MASTER
AND WAS THE READIER THEREIN BECAUSE THE LADY LOOKED ON HIM KINDLY AND COMPASSIONATELY AS HE WENT BY HER HE FOUND THE HORSES SPEEDILY A BLACK HORSE THAT WAS OF THE BLACK KNIGHT AND A BAY OF THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN AND HE CAME BACK WITH THEM LIGHTLY
HE SAW THAT THERE WAS A WIDE WAY CLEAR OF ALL HOUSES INSIDE OF THE WALL SO THAT MEN AT ARMS MIGHT GO FREELY FROM ONE PART TO THE OTHER AND HE HAD ALSO NOTED THAT A WIDE WAY LED FROM EACH PORT OUT OF THE GREAT PLACE
BEFORE HE SAW THE WESTERING SUN SHINE BRIGHTLY FROM A NAKED SWORD AND THEN ANOTHER SPRANG UP TO MEET IT AND HE HEARD FAINTLY THE CLASH OF STEEL
FLUSHING RED AND WITH KNIT BROWS A MOMENT AND THEN PASSED BY HIM WITH SWIFT AND FIRM FEET AS ONE BOTH ANGRY AND ASHAMED BUT THE CARLINE WHO HAD BEHELD THE TWO WITH A GRIN ON HER WRINKLED FACE
RUSHED ON HIS FOE AND SMOTE SO FIERCELY THAT HE FELL TO THE EARTH BEFORE HIM AND THE BIG MAN FELL UPON HIM AS HE FELL AND LET KNEE AND SWORD POMMEL AND FIST FOLLOW THE STROKE AND THERE THEY WALLOWED ON THE EARTH TOGETHER STRAIGHTWAY
THOU SAYEST SOOTH SAID HE BUT THOU ART THE LONGEST WINDED OF ALL IN TALKING GET ON LADS THEY LAUGHED AGAIN AT HIS WORD AND SPED ON WITH LESS NOISE WHILE RALPH THOUGHT WITHIN HIMSELF THAT HE WAS COME INTO STRANGE COMPANY
SO SHE SPAKE AND RALPH YET LAY ON THE GRASS AND HEARD NOUGHT BUT THE KNIGHT'S FACE WAS DARK AND SWOLLEN WITH ANGER AS HE ANSWERED MY SWORN FRIEND YEA I UNDERSTAND THY GIBE
WHERE SHOULD I BE BUT HERE AH SHE SAID BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN NEVERTHELESS SHE WENT AND FETCHED HIS WAR GEAR AND LOOKED AT HIM FONDLY AS HE DID IT ON AND WENT HIS WAYS FROM THE HALL
AH IF I HAD BUT MONEY TO BUY SOME ONE OF YOU AND A GOOD ONE
AND SO FAR AS OCCASION MAY SERVE HER SHE IS CONSTANT AT THE HOLY OFFICE NEITHER DOTH SHE SPARE TO CONFESS HER SINS AND TO DO ALL PENANCE WHICH IS BIDDEN HER YEA AND MORE FOR THOUGH I CANNOT SAY TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE WEARETH A HAIR
BUT SHE LOOKED ON HIM KINDLY AND SAID TO HIM HOW FARES IT WITH THEE I AM SORRY OF THY HURT WHICH THOU HAST HAD FOR ME HE SAID FORSOOTH LADY A CHANCE KNOCK OR TWO IS NO GREAT MATTER FOR A LAD OF UPMEADS BUT OH
SEE YE TO THAT THEN STOOD FORTH THE BIG MAN AND SAID HE IS A FAIR YOUNG KNIGHT AS YE MAY SEE AND HE RIDETH SEEKING ADVENTURES AND ROGER DID US TO WIT THAT HE WAS ABIDING IN THE BURG AT HIS PERIL
THE BARGAIN IS STRUCK BETWIXT US AND THOU MAYEST LIGHT DOWN OFF SILVERFAX AS FOR ME I WILL GO FETCH WATER FROM THE LAKE THAT WE MAY WAKE UP THIS VALIANT AND MIGHTY YOUTH THIS NEWFOUND JEWEL AND BRING HIM TO HIS WITS AGAIN
BY THEN THEY WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE HE SAW A GLIMMER OF THE DAWN IN THE EASTERN HEAVEN BUT IT WAS STILL MORE THAN DUSK AND NO MAN SPOKE AGAIN THEY WENT ON SOFTLY ACROSS THE PLAIN FIELDS OUTSIDE THE WALL
AND ENDURED WITH PATIENCE HER THRALLDOM WITH STRIPES AND TORMENTS OF HER BODY LIKE THE WORST OF THE THRALLS OF THE ANCIENT HEATHEN MEN LASTLY HE MIGHT NOT LEARN FROM THE BOOK WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS THAT LONE PLACE OR AUGHT OF THE ROAD TO THE WELL AT THE WORLD'S END
YEA HE SAID GRIMLY WHEN THOU ART WEARY OF HIM O ART THOU NOT SHAMELESS AMONGST WOMEN YET MUST I NEEDS PAY THY PRICE THOUGH MY HONOUR AND THE WELFARE OF MY LIFE GO WITH IT
THAT IT TOLD NOT WHENCE THAT LADY CAME NOR WHAT SHE WAS NOR AUGHT ELSE SAVE THAT THERE SHE WAS IN THE WOOD BY HERSELF AND WAS FOUND THEREIN BY THE KING'S SON
WHEN THOU WENTEST FORTH BEFORE I WAS TROUBLED AT THY GOING AND FEARED FOR THY RETURNING BUT NOW I FEAR NOT
YET HOW IF HE HAVE NO WILL TO FARE WITH US SHE LAUGHED AND SAID THEN SHALT THOU HAVE HIM WITH THEE AS THY CAPTIVE AND THRALL HAST THOU NOT CONQUERED HIM IN BATTLE HE STOOD SILENT A MOMENT AND THEN HE SAID THOU SAYEST IT
AND THEREWITHAL SHE TURNED HER FACE TOWARD RALPH AS SHE MIGHT DO ON ANY CHANCE MET COURTEOUS MAN AND HE SAW HER SMILING BUT SHE SAID NOUGHT TO HIM AND GAVE NO TOKEN OF KNOWING HIM THEN THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN SPRANG TO HIS FEET
SO WHEN DINNER OVER THEY TURNED TO THEIR WORK AGAIN HE WENT BACK TO THE CASTLE AND READ IN THAT BOOK AND LOOKED AT THE PICTURES THEREOF AND KEPT TURNING HIS WONDER AND HOPE AND FEAR OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN HIS MIND AND MAKING TO HIMSELF STORIES OF HOW HE SHOULD MEET THE LADY
BUT AMIDST ALL HIS THINKING HIS HEART CAME BACK TO THIS WHEN I MEET HER SHE WILL TELL ME OF IT ALL I NEED BE NO WISER THAN TO LEARN HOW TO MEET HER AND TO MAKE HER LOVE ME
SO HE TURNED INTO A STREET NARROWER THAN MOST THAT WENT EAST FROM THE SOUTH GATE AND WAS MUCH SHADED FROM THE AFTERNOON SUN AND WENT SLOWLY DOWN IT MEANING TO COME ABOUT THE INSIDE OF THE WALL TILL HE SHOULD HIT THE EAST GATE
SAID HE NOT UNCOMPELLED SHE SAID IF THOU BIDDEST ME GO WITH THREATS OF HEWING AND MANGLING THE BODY WHICH THOU SAYEST THOU LOVEST NEEDS MUST I GO THEN YET SCARCE WILT THOU DO THIS
AND ALL HAS GONE WELL BUT THE FOURTH TIME SHE WILL COME AND FIND ME GONE THE CARLINE LAUGHED WELL SHE SAID
THERE HE LOOKED AROUND HIM A LITTLE
SO THAT HE WAS WELL NIGH CHOOSING TO GO ON WITH THEIR COMPANY YET AGAIN HE THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING MIGHT WELL BEFALL WHICH WOULD FREE HIM FROM THAT FELLOWSHIP IF HE WENT WITH ROGER ALONE WHEREAS IF HE WENT WITH THE OTHERS IT WAS NOT
ART THOU ONE OF MY LADY'S LORDS RALPH REDDENED AS HE SIGHED AND SAID I AM NO CAPTAIN OF HERS THEN SMILED THE PRIEST AND SAID
AND HE LIFTED HIS HAND AGAIN BUT AGAIN SHE STAYED HIM AND SAID LOOK THOU I WILL BUY HIM OF THEE AND INDEED I OWE HIM A LIFE HOW IS THAT SAID HE WHY WOULDST THOU KNOW SHE SAID
BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE OAK TREE AGAIN LO THE KNIGHT AND THE LADY BOTH KNEELING OVER THE BODY OF THE BLACK KNIGHT AND RALPH SAW THAT THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN WAS SOBBING AND WEEPING SORELY SO THAT HE DEEMED THAT HE WAS TAKING LEAVE OF HIS FRIEND THAT LAY DEAD THERE
THUS THEY CAME INTO A LITTLE WOOD AND PASSED THROUGH IT AND THEN RALPH COULD SEE THAT THE MEN WERE SIX BESIDES ROGER BY THE GLIMMER OF THE GROWING DAWN HE SAW BEFORE THEM A SPACE OF MEADOWS WITH HIGH HEDGES ABOUT THEM AND A DIM LINE
HE WAS NO MORE GRIM AND MOODY BUT SMILING AND JOYOUS AND HE SPAKE AND SAID YOUNG MAN THIS SHALL STAND THEE IN GOOD STEAD THAT I HAVE NOT SLAIN MY FRIEND THIS BOUT SOOTH TO SAY IT MIGHT ELSE HAVE GONE HARD WITH THEE ON THE WAY TO MY HOUSE
BESIDES HE DEEMED THAT THE LADY MIGHT COME THAT DAY WHEN HE WAS ALONE IN THE CASTLE AND THAT HIMSEEMED WOULD MAKE THE MEETING SWEETER YET SO HE YEA SAID THE CARLINE'S ASKING JOYOUSLY AND IN AN HOUR'S TIME SHE WENT HER WAYS AND LEFT HIM ALONE THERE
SO HE STOOD THERE TO SEE WHAT SHOULD BETIDE AND ANON HE HEARD GREAT BLOWING OF HORNS AND TRUMPETS ALL ALONG THE WALL AND AS HE DEEMED OTHER HORNS ANSWERED FROM WITHOUT AND SO IT WAS FOR SOON
AND HE SMILED AT HER WELL PLEASED AND DEEMED IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HEAR HER VOICE SO HE WENT UP TO HER AND GREETED HER AND SHE SEEMED TO TAKE HIS GREETING WELL THOUGH SHE GLANCED SWIFTLY AT THE CARLINE IN THE DOORWAY SAID RALPH
FOR THEN I WILL RIDE MY WAYS TO THE DRY TREE AND THOU SHALT SLAY THE POOR YOUTH
O FOR A DRAUGHT OF THE WELL AT THE WORLD'S END THAT THE LOVE MIGHT LAST LONG AND LONG SO HE WENT ON A WHILE BETWIXT THE TREES AND THE THICKETS TILL IT WAS A LITTLE PAST NOON BUT ALL ON A SUDDEN A PANIC FEAR TOOK HIM
WITH MY CAPTAIN OF WAR AT THE PERIL OF OUR LIVES TO DELIVER FOUR FAITHFUL FRIENDS OF MINE WHO WERE ELSE DOOMED TO AN EVIL DEATH HE SAID NOUGHT BUT GAZED AT HER FACE WONDERING AT HER VALIANCY AND GOODNESS
SAINT ANTHONY BY NIGHT AND CLOUD SO THAT FEW MIGHT SEE HER OBEDIENT TO THE SCRIPTURE WHICH SAYETH LET NOT THY RIGHT HAND KNOW WHAT THY LEFT HAND DOETH AND SHE BAREFOOT IN HER SMOCK AMIDST THE RUGGED WOOD
THERE WAS SCARCE A SMILE ON HER FACE AS SHE SAID GENTLY ONE THING IS TO BE THOUGHT OF THAT WALTER'S SOUL IS NOT YET SO FAST IN HIS BODY THAT EITHER THOU OR SOME ROUGH HANDED LEECH MAY BE SURE OF HEALING HIM IT MUST BE THIS HAND
THEN RALPH SAW SOME OF THE MEN STOOP AND SHOOT OUT A BROAD PLANK OVER THE DITCH WHICH WAS DEEP BUT NOT WIDE THEREABOUT AND STRAIGHTWAY HE FOLLOWED THE OTHERS OVER IT GOING LAST SAVE ROGER
THOU ART MERCIFUL MY QUEEN THOUGH NOT TO ME AND A CHURL WERE I IF I WERE LESS MERCIFUL THAN THOU THEREFORE
BUT WHEN RALPH HAD TIED UP THOSE OTHER TWO STEEDS BY SILVERFAX AND DRAWN REAR TO THOSE TWAIN THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN LOOKED UP AT HIM AND SPAKE IN A CHEERFUL VOICE THOU SEEMEST TO BE NO ILL MAN THOUGH THOU HAST COME ACROSS MY LADY
FOR HE FELT HIMSELF UNFREE THEREIN AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF
BUT NOT MUCH FOR HE DEEMED THAT HER GOODWILL TO HIM WAS ABUNDANT WHICH INDEED IT WAS NOW SHE LOOKS ON HIM AND SAYS TRULY IT DOES MY HEART GOOD TO SEE THEE BUT THOU POOR BOY THOU ART WEARING THYSELF WITH THY LONGING
TILL THE PRIEST PLUCKED UP HEART AGAIN AND SAID TURNING TO RALPH BUT NOT MEETING HIS EYE MY SON I WEEP BECAUSE MEN AND WOMEN ARE SO EVIL AND MIS SAY EACH OTHER SO SORELY EVEN AS THEY DO BY THIS HOLY WOMAN AS HE SPAKE HIS TEARS BRAKE OUT AGAIN
BUT FROM WHOSE MOUTH FORSOOTH I WILL TELL THEE FROM A SORT OF IDLE JADES YOUNG WOMEN WHO WOULD BE THOUGHT FAIRER THAN THEY BE WHO ARE AFRAID OF EVERYTHING SAVE A NAKED MAN AND WHO CAN LIE EASIER THAN THEY CAN SAY THEIR PATERNOSTER
BETWIXT THE EAST GATE AND THE SOUTH BY THE SAID POSTERN RALPH SAW CERTAIN MEN STANDING AND ON THE EARTH NEAR BY WHEREAS HE WAS KEEN EYED HE SAW MORE THAN ONE MAN LYING MOVELESS
THINE OWN HEART BADE THEE TO STRIVE WITH HIM BECAUSE THOU DEEMEDST THAT HE LOVED ME BE CONTENT THOU HAST SLAIN HIM WHO STOOD IN THY WAY AS THOU DEEMEDST
AND EVEN BEFORE I WAS OLD I WAS NOT YOUNG I AM NOW FOUL OF FAVOUR AND EVEN BEFORE I BECAME FOUL I WAS NOT SO FAIR WELL THEN YEA WHAT THEN SAID RALPH THIS THEN FAIR YOUNG FOOL SAID SHE
RALPH LOOKED HARD AT THE BIG MAN WHO NOW HAD HIS SALADE THROWN BACK FROM HIS FACE TO SEE
THOUGH THEIR RAIMENT LIKE THE HOUSES WAS STOUT AND WELL WROUGHT BUT HERE AND THERE HE CAME ON A WOMAN TALLER AND WHITER THAN THE OTHERS AS THOUGH SHE WERE OF ANOTHER BLOOD ALL SUCH OF THESE
YET NOT TO THEE WILL I GIVE HIM IF I MAY HELP IT LO YOU SWEET HE IS JUST OPENING HIS EYES THEREWITH HE ROSE UP FROM RALPH WHO RAISED HIMSELF A LITTLE AND SAT UP DAZED AND FEEBLE
AND MY LIFE FAIR WILL THE GAME BE TO FIGHT WITH THY DEVIL AS I HAVE FOUGHT WITH MY FRIEND
AND HE WENT AND LAY DOWN IN HIS BED AND SLEPT AND DREAMED OF THE DAYS OF UPMEAD AND THINGS FORGOTTEN IN HIS WAKING TIME CAME BETWEEN HIM AND ANY MEMORIES OF HIS PRESENT LONGING AND THE DAYS THEREOF HE AWOKE AND AROSE BETIMES IN THE MORNING
AND RODE SMARTLY TOWARDS HIS CHURCH AND RALPH DEEMED THAT HE WAS WEEPING ONCE MORE AS FOR RALPH HE WENT QUIETLY HOME TOWARD THE CASTLE FOR THE SUN WAS SETTING NOW
AND SOME WITH BALES OF GOODS AND HOUSEHOLD STUFF
ROGER LED RIGHT ON AS IF HE KNEW THE WAY WELL
SWORD IN HAND SMILING BUT SOMEWHAT PALE HE DREW ABACK FROM THE LADY AND SPINNING ROUND ON HIS HEEL FACED RALPH AND CRIED OUT HAH HAST THOU RAISED UP A DEVIL AGAINST ME THOU SORCERESS
HE RESTED TWICE AND STILL WENT ON TILL THE FASHION OF THE THICKETS AND THE WOODS CHANGED ABOUT HIM AND AT LAST WHEN THE SUN WAS GETTING LOW HE SAW LIGHT GLEAMING THROUGH A GREAT WOOD OF PINES WHICH HAD LONG BEEN DARK BEFORE HIM AGAINST THE TALL BOLES
AND LET THIS YOUNG MAN DEPART UNHURT WHETHER THOU MADEST HIM OR HAST BUT LED HIM AWAY FROM COUNTRY AND FRIENDS AND ALL THEN DO THOU COME WITH ME AND MAKE SOME SEMBLANCE OF LOVING ME AND SUFFER ME TO LOVE THEE
WHERE ERST THOU SHAMEDST ME NOW WILL I BUY THY NAY SAY WITH MINE AND IF THOU GIVE THE YOUNGLING HIS LIFE AND SUFFER HIM TO COME HIS WAYS WITH US
LEST SHE SHOULD INDEED COME TO THE CASTLE WHILE HE WAS AWAY AND NOT FINDING HIM DEPART AGAIN WHO KNOWS WHITHER AND WHEN THIS THOUGHT CAME UPON HIM HE CRIED ALOUD AND HASTENED AT HIS SWIFTEST BACK AGAIN TO THE CASTLE AND CAME THERE BREATHLESS AND WEARIED
AND SEEK TO SUNWAY THROUGH THE BLIND WOODLAND WHICH SHALL IT BE THE KNIGHT LAUGHED OUTRIGHT AND SAID YEA FAIR ONE THIS IS MUCH LIKE TO THE TALE OF THE CARLE AT THE FERRY WITH THE FOX AND THE GOAT AND THE CABBAGE
AND THE LONG UNBITTEN BUTTERCUPS DAY GREW APACE AND BY THEN THEY WERE UNDER THE BARN GABLE WHICH HE HAD SEEN ALOOF
AND AS TO MY GOING WITH THEE AND THE LADY THOU HAST HEARD ME SAY UNDER THY DAGGER THAT I WOULD NOT FORBEAR TO FOLLOW HER SO I SCARCE NEED THY COMMAND THERETO THE KNIGHT SCOWLED ON HIM AND SAID HOLD THY PEACE FOOL THOU WERT BEST NOT STIR MY WRATH AGAIN
TILL HE HAD GOTTEN THE WHOLE TALE INTO HIS HEAD
WHICH WAS THE FISH AND FOWL MARKET HE CAME INTO A LONG STREET THAT LED HIM DOWN TO A GATE RIGHT OVER AGAINST THAT WHEREBY HE HAD ENTERED THE BURG
RALPH SAID TO HIMSELF WHEN HE SAW HER DEPART THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE MORE JOY IN THE CASTLE OF HIS LADY IF HE WERE ALONE AND WOULD WEAR AWAY THE DAY IN BETTER PATIENCE THEREFOR BUT IN SOOTH THE HOURS OF THAT DAY WERE WORSE TO WEAR THAN ANY DAY THERE HAD YET BEEN
AND HE HEARD HOW SHE SANG IN A DRY HARSH VOICE
AND HE LAUGHED IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS WRATH BUT SHE WAS PALE AND HER LIPS QUIVERED AS SHE SAID SOFTLY AND SWEETLY WILT THOU VERILY SLAY THIS YOUNG MAN AND WHY NOT SAID HE
THE MOON'S O'ERHEAD AND WE NEED THE CLEAR OUR SPOIL TO SHARE SHAKE THE LOTS IN THE HELM THEN FOR BRETHREN ARE WE AND THE GOODS OF MY MISSING
THEREAT RALPH'S HEART FELL AGAIN AND HE SAID SAYEST THOU MOTHER THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS ABIDING LIKE ME IN THE TOWER I KNOW NOT WHAT THY WORDS MEAN THE CARLINE LAUGHED
HE STILL HAD HIS BACK TO RALPH AND WAS STARING AT THE LADY SHE TURNED HER HEAD A LITTLE AND MADE A SIGN TO RALPH JUST AS THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN SAID THOU MISDOUBTEST THEE WHO SHALL HELP THEE IN THE DESERT LOOK OVER THY LEFT SHOULDER SHE SAID
THERE WERE FOLK ENOUGH IN THE STREETS AND NOW RALPH AS WAS LIKE TO BE LOOKED SPECIALLY AT THE WOMEN AND THOUGHT MANY OF THEM LITTLE BETTER FAVOURED THAN THE MEN BEING BOTH DARK AND LOW NEITHER WERE THEY GAILY CLAD
SOME GOING AFOOT AND SOME FOR WEARINESS BORNE IN WAINS FOR ALL THESE WAR TAKEN THRALLS WERE WOMEN AND WOMEN CHILDREN OF MALES THERE WAS NOT SO MUCH AS A LITTLE LAD OF THE WOMEN
THAT NO MAN EMBRACED THAT SLENDER YOUTH AND THAT HE HELD HIM SOMEWHAT ALOOF FROM THE OTHERS AND ALL SEEMED TO DO HIM REVERENCE NOW SPAKE ONE OF THE RUNAWAYS WELL LADS
BUT AT LAST HE HEARD THE TINKLE OF A LITTLE BELL COMING TOWARDS HIM SO HE STOOD STILL AND GOT THE HILT OF HIS SWORD READY TO HIS HAND AND THE TINKLE DREW NEARER AND HE HEARD WITHAL THE TRAMPLE OF SOME RIDING BEAST SO HE WENT TOWARD THE SOUND AND PRESENTLY IN A CLEARER PLACE OF THE WOOD
HE WENT NOT WITHOUT THE HOUSE AT ALL THAT DAY FOR HE DEEMED THAT THE FOLK ABROAD WOULD NOTE OF HIM THAT HE WAS SO CHANGED AND RESTLESS WHILES HE READ IN THAT BOOK OR TURNED THE LEAVES OVER NOT READING IT WHILES HE WENT INTO THE CHAMBER OF ESTATE
WHEN THE FOLK SHOULD HAVE GONE THEIR WAYS HOME HE SAW NO FOLK IN THE STREET SAVE HERE AND THERE AN OLD WOMAN SITTING AT THE DOOR OF HER HOUSE AND MAYBE A YOUNG CHILD WITH HER AS HE CAME TO WHERE THE STREET TURNED SOMEWHAT
THOU FAIR MAN AND DOTH SO WITH HER RAIMENT THAT THOU MAYST BEST SEE HOW SHAPELY SHE IS OF LIMB AND FOOT AND TOYETH HER RIGHT HAND WITH HER LEFT WRIST AND THE LIKE WELL AS FOR ME I HAVE HAD MORE LOVERS THAN ONE OR TWO
THAT HE TOOK FOR THE ROOF OF A BARN OR GRANGE AND BEYOND THAT A DARK MASS OF TREES STILL THEY PRESSED ON WITHOUT SPEAKING A DOG BARKED NOT FAR OFF AND THE COCKS WERE CROWING
ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD SO THAT THE YOUNG MAN OF UPMEADS COULD NOT STAND UP UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE BLOW BUT FELL TO THE EARTH SWOONING AND THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN KNELT ON HIM AND DREW OUT AN ANLACE SHORT THICK AND SHARP AND CRIED OUT
AND THAT IT WOULD TURN OUT TO BE NONE OF THE EASIEST TO WIN AND FORSOOTH RALPH HIMSELF WAS MUCH OF THAT MIND NOW HE WAS JUST WITHIN THE SOUTH GATE WHEN HE HELD THIS TALK AND THERE WERE MANY FOLK THEREBY ALREADY
I HAVE SEEN THEE BEFORE YEA SHE SAID TWICE BEFORE FAIR KNIGHT HOW IS THAT HE SAID ONCE I SAW THEE THE FAIREST THING IN THE WORLD AND EVIL MEN WOULD HAVE LED THEE TO SLAUGHTER BUT NOT TWICE
THE ROSINESS OF HER ANCLES SHOWED AMIDST HER WHITE SANDAL THONGS AND THERE WERE SILVER RINGS AND GOLD ON HER ARMS ALONG WITH THE IRON RING NOW SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES AND LOOKED SHYLY AT RALPH
THAT I AM IN YOUR FELLOWSHIP AS ONE COMPELLED TO BE SHORT WITH YOU I CRAVE LEAVE TO DEPART AND GO MINE OWN ROAD AS HE SPOKE HE SAW THE YOUTH WALKING UP AND DOWN IN SHORT TURNS BUT HIS FACE HE COULD SCARCE SEE AT ALL
THEN SHE SAID AS SHE DREW HER HAND AWAY AND SPAKE IN SUCH A VOICE AND SO LOOKING AT HIM THAT EVERY WORD WAS AS A CARESS TO HIM THY SOUL IS COMING BACK TO THEE MY FRIEND AND THOU ART WELL AT EASE IS IT NOT SO O YEA
AND EACH ENDED NOT BUT IN A GATE BUT AS TO ANY CASTLE IN THE TOWN HE SAW NONE AND WHEN HE ASKED A BURGHER THEREOF
SAID THE KNIGHT WHERE DOST THOU COME FROM WHERE IS THINE HOME SAID RALPH UPMEADS WELL THEN QUOTH THE BIG KNIGHT GO BACK TO UPMEADS AND LIVE
BUT NOW MUST WE SET FORTH ON OUR ROAD AND HERE IS WORK FOR THEE TO DO
FOR THE WORDS THAT HE HAD HEARD HE HEEDED NOT SAVE AS THEY MADE PICTURES FOR HIM OF THE WAYS OF THAT WOMAN OF THE FOREST SO THEY WENT ON SOBERLY TILL THE PRIEST LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ABOUT LIKE ONE COME OUT OF SLUMBER AND SAID IN A FIRM VOICE
WHAT WILT THOU DO WILT THOU ABIDE HERE BY WALTER THYSELF ALONE AND LET ME BRING THE IMP OF UPMEADS HOME TO OUR HOUSE OR WILT THOU RIDE HOME AND SEND FOLK WITH A LITTER TO US OR SHALL THIS YOUNGLING RIDE AT ALL ADVENTURE
HEEDED THE CLASHING OF THEIR ARMOUR RALPH RAN WITH THE BEST AND ENTERED THE WOOD ALONGSIDE THE SLIM YOUTH AFORESAID WHO STAYED NOT AT THE WOOD'S EDGE BUT WENT ON RUNNING STILL BUT RALPH STAYED AND TURNED TO SEE WHAT WAS TOWARD
SO RALPH LOOKED AND SAW THAT THEY HAD STRIPPED THE KNIGHT OF HIS HAUBERK AND HELM AND BARED HIS BODY AND THAT THE LADY WAS DRESSING A GREAT AND SORE WOUND IN HIS SIDE NEITHER WAS HE COME TO HIMSELF AGAIN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN AND VERY GOODLY TO LOOK ON
SHE KNIT HER BROW AND SPAKE ANGRILY LEAVE TO DEPART SHE SAID THEN AFTER A WHILE AND IN A KINDER VOICE AND THUS MUCH OF MY LOVE THAT I PRAY THEE NOT TO SORROW FOR ME BUT TO HAVE A GOOD HEART
AND AS HUMBLE AND MEEK AS DOROTHY SHE BESTOWETH HER GOODS PLENTIFULLY TO THE CHURCH
HE CAME OUT OF THE PINEWOOD ON TO THE GRASS BUT THERE WERE THORNBUSHES A FEW ABOUT SO THAT MOVING WARILY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER HE MIGHT PERCHANCE SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN WARILY HE WENT FORSOOTH GOING ALONG THE GREEN STRAND TO THE EAST AND THE HEAD OF THAT WATER
I SEEK ADVENTURES BUT UNLESS I SEE MORE THAN I HAVE THIS FORENOON OR THOU CANST TELL ME OF THEM BACK WILL I WHENCE I CAME
THAT THEY SHOULD NOT CLASH AND DOWN THEY CAME INTO THE HALL AND FOUND THE DOOR ON THE LATCH SO OUT THEY WENT AND RALPH SAW THAT IT WAS SOMEWHAT CLOUDY THE MOON WAS SET AND IT WAS DARK BUT RALPH KNEW BY THE SCENT
OLD AND YOUNG WEIGH IN THY MIND BESIDE THE WORD I TELL THEE OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND KNOW CONCERNING THIS MOST EXCELLENT OF LADIES I TROW NOT AND FOR MY PART I TELL THEE THAT THOUGH SHE IS VERILY AS FAIR AS VENUS GOD SAVE US
MANY SEEMED FAIR TO RALPH DESPITE THEIR GRIEF AND TRAVEL AND AS HE LOOKED ON THEM HE DEEMED THAT THEY MUST BE OF THE KINDRED AND NATION OF THE FAIR WHITE WOMEN HE HAD SEEN IN THE STREETS THOUGH THEY WERE NOT CLAD LIKE THOSE BUT DIVERSELY
SCOWLING AND HIS FACE WHITE AS CHALK THEN HE SPAKE TO HER COLDLY AND STERNLY STRETCHING OUT HIS BLOODY SWORD BEFORE HER I HAVE DONE THY BIDDING AND SLAIN MY VERY EARTHLY FRIEND OF FRIENDS FOR THY SAKE
THOUGH IT MAY BE LEADING A FAIR WOMAN BY THE HAND SO GO AND ALL LUCK GO WITH THEE RALPH SMILED AT HER WORDS AND WENT HIS WAYS AND CAME INTO THE WOOD THAT LAY DUE SOUTH FROM THE CASTLE AND HE WENT ON AND ON AND HAD NO THOUGHT OF TURNING BACK
FOR NOW HE KNEW WELL THAT THE BIG MAN WAS EVEN HE WHOM HE HAD FIRST MET AT THE CHURCHYARD GATE OF THE THORP UNDER BEAR HILL YET HE DEEMED THAT THERE WAS NOUGHT FOR IT NOW BUT TO GO ON WITHIN A WHILE THEY ALL SLACKED SOMEWHAT
AND ALL YE OUT WITH YOU OUT A DOORS HERE BE MEN WARE THE DRY TREE BOWS AND BILLS BOWS AND BILLS WITH THAT THOSE FELLOWS OF RALPH MADE NO MORE ADO
CREEPING FROM BUSH TO BUSH AND FROM TREE TO TREE FOR HERE IF NOWHERE ABOUT THE CIRCUIT OF THE BURG
AND HEARD THE BLEATING OF SHEEP AND NOW HE SAW THOSE SIX MEN CLEARLY AND NOTED THAT ONE OF THEM WAS VERY BIG AND TALL AND ONE SMALL AND SLENDER AND IT CAME INTO HIS MIND
WITHAL SHE IS AS STRONG AS A KNIGHT AND I WARRANT HER HARDIER OF HEART THAN MOST KNIGHTS A HAPPY MAN SHALT THOU BE FOR SURELY I DEEM THOU HAST NOT COME HITHER TO ABIDE HER WITHOUT SOME TOKEN OR WARRANT OF HER RALPH HELD DOWN HIS HEAD
TILL SHE SHOULD CURSE HER FATE THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN BORN LITTLE AND DARK SKINNED AND FREE AND WITH HEELS UN BLOODIED WITH THE BLOOD OF HER BACK THUS SHE WENT ON THOUGH THE DAMSEL WAS LONG OUT OF EAR SHOT OF HER CURSES
THAT WAS HOW ENOCH DREBBER CAME TO HIS END ALL I HAD TO DO THEN WAS TO DO AS MUCH FOR STANGERSON AND SO PAY OFF JOHN FERRIER'S DEBT I KNEW THAT HE WAS STAYING AT HALLIDAY'S PRIVATE HOTEL AND I HUNG ABOUT ALL DAY
GIVE ME A GLASS OF WATER IF YOU PLEASE MY MOUTH GETS DRY WITH THE TALKING
IT WOULD NOT MAKE A PENNYWORTH OF DIFFERENCE TO ME OR TO MY WORK I WAS ON THE POINT OF ASKING HIM WHAT THAT WORK MIGHT BE BUT SOMETHING IN HIS MANNER SHOWED ME THAT THE QUESTION WOULD BE AN UNWELCOME ONE I PONDERED OVER OUR SHORT CONVERSATION HOWEVER
MY COMPANION SMILED AN ENIGMATICAL SMILE THAT'S JUST HIS LITTLE PECULIARITY HE SAID A GOOD MANY PEOPLE HAVE WANTED TO KNOW HOW HE FINDS THINGS OUT
I CAN DRIVE YOU SAID LESTRADE GOOD AND GREGSON CAN COME INSIDE WITH ME YOU TOO DOCTOR YOU HAVE TAKEN AN INTEREST IN THE CASE AND MAY AS WELL STICK TO US I ASSENTED GLADLY AND WE ALL DESCENDED TOGETHER OUR PRISONER MADE NO ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE BUT STEPPED CALMLY INTO THE CAB WHICH HAD BEEN HIS
AND WE FOLLOWED HIM LESTRADE MOUNTED THE BOX WHIPPED UP THE HORSE AND BROUGHT US IN A VERY SHORT TIME TO OUR DESTINATION WE WERE USHERED INTO A SMALL CHAMBER WHERE A POLICE INSPECTOR NOTED DOWN OUR PRISONER'S NAME AND THE NAMES OF THE MEN WITH WHOSE MURDER HE HAD BEEN CHARGED
MY HEALTH FORBADE ME FROM VENTURING OUT UNLESS THE WEATHER WAS EXCEPTIONALLY GENIAL AND I HAD NO FRIENDS WHO WOULD CALL UPON ME AND BREAK THE MONOTONY OF MY DAILY EXISTENCE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
TO THIS DAY IN THE LONELY RANCHES OF THE WEST THE NAME OF THE DANITE BAND OR THE AVENGING ANGELS IS A SINISTER AND AN ILL OMENED ONE FULLER KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORGANIZATION WHICH PRODUCED SUCH TERRIBLE RESULTS SERVED TO INCREASE RATHER THAN TO LESSEN THE HORROR WHICH IT INSPIRED IN THE MINDS OF MEN
I HAVE NO DOUBT HOWEVER THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE CHARACTERISTIC REACTION AS HE SPOKE HE THREW INTO THE VESSEL A FEW WHITE CRYSTALS AND THEN ADDED SOME DROPS OF A TRANSPARENT FLUID IN AN INSTANT
AND WHY RETRIBUTION HAS COME UPON HIM I HAD MY PLANS ARRANGED BY WHICH I SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING THE MAN WHO HAD WRONGED ME UNDERSTAND THAT HIS OLD SIN HAD FOUND HIM OUT IT CHANCED THAT SOME DAYS BEFORE A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN LOOKING OVER SOME HOUSES IN THE BRIXTON ROAD HAD DROPPED THE KEY OF ONE OF THEM IN MY CARRIAGE
NOR THE SECRET SOCIETIES OF ITALY WERE EVER ABLE TO PUT A MORE FORMIDABLE MACHINERY IN MOTION THAN THAT WHICH CAST A CLOUD OVER THE STATE OF UTAH ITS INVISIBILITY AND THE MYSTERY WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO IT MADE THIS ORGANIZATION DOUBLY TERRIBLE IT APPEARED TO BE OMNISCIENT AND OMNIPOTENT
AND SPENDING SUCH MONEY AS I HAD CONSIDERABLY MORE FREELY THAN I OUGHT SO ALARMING DID THE STATE OF MY FINANCES BECOME THAT I SOON REALIZED THAT I MUST EITHER LEAVE THE METROPOLIS AND RUSTICATE SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY
WOULD YOU MURDER ME HE STAMMERED THERE IS NO MURDER I ANSWERED WHO TALKS OF MURDERING A MAD DOG WHAT MERCY HAD YOU UPON MY POOR DARLING WHEN YOU DRAGGED HER FROM HER SLAUGHTERED FATHER AND BORE HER AWAY TO YOUR ACCURSED AND SHAMELESS HAREM
SAID HE STAMPING ABOUT WE'LL SOON HAVE A LIGHT I SAID STRIKING A MATCH AND PUTTING IT TO A WAX CANDLE WHICH I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME NOW ENOCH DREBBER I CONTINUED TURNING TO HIM AND HOLDING THE LIGHT TO MY OWN FACE WHO AM I
BUT I INQUIRED AND INQUIRED UNTIL AT LAST I DROPPED ACROSS THEM THEY WERE AT A BOARDING HOUSE AT CAMBERWELL OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER WHEN ONCE I FOUND THEM OUT I KNEW THAT I HAD THEM AT MY MERCY I HAD GROWN MY BEARD AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF THEIR RECOGNIZING ME I WOULD DOG THEM AND FOLLOW THEM UNTIL I SAW MY OPPORTUNITY
AND WHO CAME THREE OR FOUR TIMES IN A SINGLE WEEK ONE MORNING A YOUNG GIRL CALLED FASHIONABLY DRESSED AND STAYED FOR HALF AN HOUR OR MORE THE SAME AFTERNOON BROUGHT A GREY HEADED SEEDY VISITOR
AND LEAVE MY WORK UNDONE AT LAST ONE EVENING I WAS DRIVING UP AND DOWN TORQUAY TERRACE AS THE STREET WAS CALLED IN WHICH THEY BOARDED WHEN I SAW A CAB DRIVE UP TO THEIR DOOR PRESENTLY SOME LUGGAGE WAS BROUGHT OUT
STUDY IN SCARLET
PRESENTLY HOWEVER I FOUND THAT HE HAD MANY ACQUAINTANCES AND THOSE IN THE MOST DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SOCIETY THERE WAS ONE LITTLE SALLOW RAT FACED DARK EYED FELLOW WHO WAS INTRODUCED TO ME AS MISTER LESTRADE
YOU PROPOSED THIS ARRANGEMENT SO YOU MUST NOT HOLD ME RESPONSIBLE IF WE DON'T GET ON IT WILL BE EASY TO PART COMPANY I ANSWERED IT SEEMS TO ME STAMFORD I ADDED LOOKING HARD AT MY COMPANION
HE APPEARS TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY HORROR PERPETRATED IN THE CENTURY TEN PLAYS THE VIOLIN WELL ELEVEN IS AN EXPERT SINGLESTICK PLAYER BOXER AND SWORDSMAN TWELVE
WHEN SHALL WE SEE THEM CALL FOR ME HERE AT NOON TO MORROW AND WE'LL GO TOGETHER AND SETTLE EVERYTHING HE ANSWERED ALL RIGHT NOON EXACTLY SAID I SHAKING HIS HAND WE LEFT HIM WORKING AMONG HIS CHEMICALS
BUT HERE WE ARE AND YOU MUST FORM YOUR OWN IMPRESSIONS ABOUT HIM AS HE SPOKE WE TURNED DOWN A NARROW LANE AND PASSED THROUGH A SMALL SIDE DOOR WHICH OPENED INTO A WING OF THE GREAT HOSPITAL IT WAS FAMILIAR GROUND TO ME
OR WHETHER THE PLAYING WAS SIMPLY THE RESULT OF A WHIM OR FANCY WAS MORE THAN I COULD DETERMINE I MIGHT HAVE REBELLED AGAINST THESE EXASPERATING SOLOS HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT HE USUALLY TERMINATED THEM BY PLAYING IN QUICK SUCCESSION
THAT I MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED HIM OF BEING ADDICTED TO THE USE OF SOME NARCOTIC HAD NOT THE TEMPERANCE AND CLEANLINESS OF HIS WHOLE LIFE FORBIDDEN SUCH A NOTION AS THE WEEKS WENT BY
THE LATTER IS VALUELESS IF THE STAINS ARE A FEW HOURS OLD NOW THIS APPEARS TO ACT AS WELL WHETHER THE BLOOD IS OLD OR NEW HAD THIS TEST BEEN INVENTED
AND WE WALKED TOGETHER TOWARDS MY HOTEL BY THE WAY I ASKED SUDDENLY STOPPING AND TURNING UPON STAMFORD
AND HOW HAVE I NEGLECTED IT ASKED FERRIER THROWING OUT HIS HANDS IN EXPOSTULATION HAVE I NOT GIVEN TO THE COMMON FUND HAVE I NOT ATTENDED AT THE TEMPLE HAVE I NOT WHERE ARE YOUR WIVES ASKED YOUNG LOOKING ROUND HIM CALL THEM IN THAT I MAY GREET THEM
AND PRINTED IT ON A CONVENIENT PLACE ON THE WALL THEN I WALKED DOWN TO MY CAB AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS NOBODY ABOUT AND THAT THE NIGHT WAS STILL VERY WILD
IF ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE EVER PINED FOR A THING AND LONGED FOR IT DURING TWENTY LONG YEARS AND THEN SUDDENLY FOUND IT WITHIN YOUR REACH YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS I LIT A CIGAR AND PUFFED AT IT TO STEADY MY NERVES BUT MY HANDS WERE TREMBLING AND MY TEMPLES THROBBING WITH EXCITEMENT
OR ATTAIN SUCH PRECISE INFORMATION UNLESS HE HAD SOME DEFINITE END IN VIEW DESULTORY READERS ARE SELDOM REMARKABLE FOR THE EXACTNESS OF THEIR LEARNING NO MAN BURDENS HIS MIND WITH SMALL MATTERS
CHAPTER TWO THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION WE MET NEXT DAY AS HE HAD ARRANGED
OUR PRISONER'S FURIOUS RESISTANCE DID NOT APPARENTLY INDICATE ANY FEROCITY IN HIS DISPOSITION TOWARDS OURSELVES FOR ON FINDING HIMSELF POWERLESS
CHEMISTRY PROFOUND EIGHT ANATOMY ACCURATE BUT UNSYSTEMATIC NINE SENSATIONAL LITERATURE IMMENSE
TOGETHER SHERLOCK HOLMES SEEMED DELIGHTED AT THE IDEA OF SHARING HIS ROOMS WITH ME I HAVE MY EYE ON A SUITE IN BAKER STREET HE SAID WHICH WOULD SUIT US DOWN TO THE GROUND YOU DON'T MIND THE SMELL OF STRONG TOBACCO I HOPE
HE CRIED BUT IT WAS YOU WHO BROKE HER INNOCENT HEART I SHRIEKED THRUSTING THE BOX BEFORE HIM LET THE HIGH GOD JUDGE BETWEEN US CHOOSE AND EAT THERE IS DEATH IN ONE AND LIFE IN THE OTHER I SHALL TAKE WHAT YOU LEAVE LET US SEE IF THERE IS JUSTICE UPON THE EARTH OR IF WE ARE RULED BY CHANCE
WITH MANY OTHER OFFICERS WHO WERE IN THE SAME SITUATION AS MYSELF AND SUCCEEDED IN REACHING CANDAHAR IN SAFETY WHERE I FOUND MY REGIMENT AND AT ONCE ENTERED UPON MY NEW DUTIES
THAT VERY EVENING I MOVED MY THINGS ROUND FROM THE HOTEL AND ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING SHERLOCK HOLMES FOLLOWED ME WITH SEVERAL BOXES AND PORTMANTEAUS
A RASH WORD OR A HASTY ACT WAS FOLLOWED BY ANNIHILATION AND YET NONE KNEW WHAT THE NATURE MIGHT BE OF THIS TERRIBLE POWER WHICH WAS SUSPENDED OVER THEM NO WONDER THAT MEN WENT ABOUT IN FEAR AND TREMBLING AND THAT EVEN IN THE HEART OF THE WILDERNESS THEY DARED NOT WHISPER THE DOUBTS WHICH OPPRESSED THEM
HE REMARKED TO SHERLOCK HOLMES MY CAB'S AT THE DOOR IF YOU'LL LOOSE MY LEGS I'LL WALK DOWN TO IT I'M NOT SO LIGHT TO LIFT AS I USED TO BE
IN HEIGHT HE WAS RATHER OVER SIX FEET AND SO EXCESSIVELY LEAN THAT HE SEEMED TO BE CONSIDERABLY TALLER HIS EYES WERE SHARP AND PIERCING SAVE DURING THOSE INTERVALS OF TORPOR TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED
INDEED I MURMURED CRIMINAL CASES ARE CONTINUALLY HINGING UPON THAT ONE POINT A MAN IS SUSPECTED OF A CRIME MONTHS PERHAPS AFTER IT HAS BEEN COMMITTED HIS LINEN OR CLOTHES ARE EXAMINED
FROM THAT DAY I HAD ALWAYS MY PILL BOXES ABOUT WITH ME AND THE TIME HAD NOW COME WHEN I WAS TO USE THEM IT WAS NEARER ONE THAN TWELVE AND A WILD BLEAK NIGHT BLOWING HARD AND RAINING IN TORRENTS
FERRIER RAN TO THE DOOR TO GREET THE MORMON CHIEF THE LATTER HOWEVER RECEIVED HIS SALUTATIONS COLDLY AND FOLLOWED HIM WITH A STERN FACE INTO THE SITTING ROOM BROTHER FERRIER HE SAID TAKING A SEAT AND EYEING THE FARMER KEENLY FROM UNDER HIS LIGHT COLOURED EYELASHES
AND TO TAKE UP MY QUARTERS IN SOME LESS PRETENTIOUS AND LESS EXPENSIVE DOMICILE ON THE VERY DAY THAT I HAD COME TO THIS CONCLUSION I WAS STANDING AT THE CRITERION BAR WHEN SOME ONE TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER
NO OF COURSE NOT I SHOULDN'T CARE TO HEAR YOU SAY YOU DID
YES TO VERIFY HOW FAR BRUISES MAY BE PRODUCED AFTER DEATH I SAW HIM AT IT WITH MY OWN EYES AND YET YOU SAY HE IS NOT A MEDICAL STUDENT NO HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THE OBJECTS OF HIS STUDIES ARE
KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE NIL TWO PHILOSOPHY NIL THREE ASTRONOMY NIL FOUR POLITICS FEEBLE
AS I DROVE I COULD SEE OLD JOHN FERRIER AND SWEET LUCY LOOKING AT ME OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND SMILING AT ME JUST AS PLAIN AS I SEE YOU ALL IN THIS ROOM ALL THE WAY THEY WERE AHEAD OF ME
YOU MUST STUDY HIM THEN STAMFORD SAID AS HE BADE ME GOOD BYE YOU'LL FIND HIM A KNOTTY PROBLEM THOUGH I'LL WAGER HE LEARNS MORE ABOUT YOU THAN YOU ABOUT HIM GOOD BYE GOOD BYE I ANSWERED
WHEN HE HEARD THE CLICK OF THE LATCH AND LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW SAW A STOUT SANDY HAIRED MIDDLE AGED MAN COMING UP THE PATHWAY HIS HEART LEAPT TO HIS MOUTH FOR THIS WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE GREAT BRIGHAM YOUNG HIMSELF FULL OF TREPIDATION FOR HE KNEW THAT SUCH A VISIT BODED HIM LITTLE GOOD
AND EARLY NEXT MORNING I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME LADDERS WHICH WERE LYING IN THE LANE BEHIND THE HOTEL AND SO MADE MY WAY INTO HIS ROOM IN THE GREY OF THE DAWN I WOKE HIM UP AND TOLD HIM THAT THE HOUR HAD COME WHEN HE WAS TO ANSWER FOR THE LIFE HE HAD TAKEN SO LONG BEFORE
THERE HE REMAINED UNTIL CLOSING TIME AND WHEN HE CAME OUT HE WAS SO FAR GONE THAT I KNEW THE GAME WAS IN MY OWN HANDS
I'VE GOT A GOOD DEAL TO SAY OUR PRISONER SAID SLOWLY I WANT TO TELL YOU GENTLEMEN ALL ABOUT IT HADN'T YOU BETTER RESERVE THAT FOR YOUR TRIAL
BUT THEY WON'T LET US LEAVE HIS DAUGHTER OBJECTED WAIT TILL JEFFERSON COMES AND WE'LL SOON MANAGE THAT IN THE MEANTIME DON'T YOU FRET YOURSELF MY DEARIE AND DON'T GET YOUR EYES SWELLED UP ELSE HE'LL BE WALKING INTO ME WHEN HE SEES YOU
YOUNG STAMFORD LOOKED RATHER STRANGELY AT ME OVER HIS WINE GLASS
THAT GREAT CESSPOOL INTO WHICH ALL THE LOUNGERS AND IDLERS OF THE EMPIRE ARE IRRESISTIBLY DRAINED THERE I STAYED FOR SOME TIME AT A PRIVATE HOTEL IN THE STRAND LEADING A COMFORTLESS MEANINGLESS EXISTENCE
I COULD NOT HELP IT SHE SAID IN ANSWER TO HIS LOOK HIS VOICE RANG THROUGH THE HOUSE OH FATHER FATHER WHAT SHALL WE DO DON'T YOU SCARE YOURSELF HE ANSWERED DRAWING HER TO HIM AND PASSING HIS BROAD ROUGH HAND CARESSINGLY OVER HER CHESTNUT HAIR
TO SOLVE HE WALKED DOWN THE ROAD AND WENT INTO ONE OR TWO LIQUOR SHOPS STAYING FOR NEARLY HALF AN HOUR IN THE LAST OF THEM WHEN HE CAME OUT HE STAGGERED IN HIS WALK AND WAS EVIDENTLY PRETTY WELL ON
BUT AS ECCENTRIC AS ALL HIS OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT HE COULD PLAY PIECES AND DIFFICULT PIECES I KNEW WELL BECAUSE AT MY REQUEST HE HAS PLAYED ME SOME OF MENDELSSOHN'S LIEDER AND OTHER FAVOURITES WHEN LEFT TO HIMSELF HOWEVER
THE OFFICIAL WAS A WHITE FACED UNEMOTIONAL MAN WHO WENT THROUGH HIS DUTIES IN A DULL MECHANICAL WAY THE PRISONER WILL BE PUT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES IN THE COURSE OF THE WEEK HE SAID
HE SHRUNK STILL FURTHER AWAY AS I SPOKE AND I COULD SEE ON HIS FACE THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS MAD SO I WAS FOR THE TIME
HIS HANDS WERE INVARIABLY BLOTTED WITH INK AND STAINED WITH CHEMICALS YET HE WAS POSSESSED OF EXTRAORDINARY DELICACY OF TOUCH
I ANSWERED THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH I GENERALLY HAVE CHEMICALS ABOUT AND OCCASIONALLY DO EXPERIMENTS WOULD THAT ANNOY YOU BY NO MEANS LET ME SEE WHAT ARE MY OTHER SHORTCOMINGS I GET IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES AND DON'T OPEN MY MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END
NO DOUBT YOU SEE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS DISCOVERY OF MINE IT IS INTERESTING CHEMICALLY NO DOUBT I ANSWERED BUT PRACTICALLY WHY MAN IT IS THE MOST PRACTICAL MEDICO LEGAL DISCOVERY FOR YEARS
THERE'S A PARTY STARTING FOR NEVADA TO MORROW AND I'LL MANAGE TO SEND HIM A MESSAGE LETTING HIM KNOW THE HOLE WE ARE IN
BY MEANS OF THIS I HAD ACCESS TO AT LEAST ONE SPOT IN THIS GREAT CITY
HAVING COMPLETED MY STUDIES THERE I WAS DULY ATTACHED TO THE FIFTH NORTHUMBERLAND FUSILIERS AS ASSISTANT SURGEON THE REGIMENT WAS STATIONED IN INDIA AT THE TIME AND BEFORE I COULD JOIN IT
I HAD NEITHER KITH NOR KIN IN ENGLAND AND WAS THEREFORE AS FREE AS AIR OR AS FREE AS AN INCOME OF ELEVEN SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE A DAY WILL PERMIT A MAN TO BE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES I NATURALLY GRAVITATED TO LONDON
IN HIS VELVETEEN UNIFORM WHEN ANY OF THESE NONDESCRIPT INDIVIDUALS PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
AND TURNING ROUND I RECOGNIZED YOUNG STAMFORD WHO HAD BEEN A DRESSER UNDER ME AT BARTS THE SIGHT OF A FRIENDLY FACE IN THE GREAT WILDERNESS OF LONDON IS A PLEASANT THING INDEED TO A LONELY MAN IN OLD DAYS
JOHN FERRIER UTTERED THESE CONSOLING REMARKS IN A VERY CONFIDENT TONE
I AM NOT STRONG ENOUGH YET TO STAND MUCH NOISE OR EXCITEMENT I HAD ENOUGH OF BOTH IN AFGHANISTAN TO LAST ME FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY NATURAL EXISTENCE HOW COULD I MEET THIS FRIEND OF YOURS
RETURNED MY COMPANION HE EITHER AVOIDS THE PLACE FOR WEEKS OR ELSE HE WORKS THERE FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
IT DEPENDS ON THE PLAYER I ANSWERED A WELL PLAYED VIOLIN IS A TREAT FOR THE GODS A BADLY PLAYED ONE OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT HE CRIED WITH A MERRY LAUGH I THINK WE MAY CONSIDER THE THING AS SETTLED THAT IS IF THE ROOMS ARE AGREEABLE TO YOU
IT SEEMS TO BE A VERY DELICATE TEST I REMARKED BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL THE OLD GUIACUM TEST WAS VERY CLUMSY AND UNCERTAIN SO IS THE MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION FOR BLOOD CORPUSCLES
IF I DIE TO MORROW AS IS LIKELY ENOUGH I DIE KNOWING THAT MY WORK IN THIS WORLD IS DONE AND WELL DONE
NONE KNEW WHO BELONGED TO THIS RUTHLESS SOCIETY THE NAMES OF THE PARTICIPATORS IN THE DEEDS OF BLOOD AND VIOLENCE DONE UNDER THE NAME OF RELIGION WERE KEPT PROFOUNDLY SECRET THE VERY FRIEND TO WHOM YOU COMMUNICATED YOUR MISGIVINGS AS TO THE PROPHET AND HIS MISSION
AND DRAWING OFF THE RESULTING DROP OF BLOOD IN A CHEMICAL PIPETTE NOW I ADD THIS SMALL QUANTITY OF BLOOD TO A LITRE OF WATER YOU PERCEIVE THAT THE RESULTING MIXTURE HAS THE APPEARANCE OF PURE WATER THE PROPORTION OF BLOOD CANNOT BE MORE THAN ONE IN A MILLION
IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE NOT MARRIED FERRIER ANSWERED BUT WOMEN WERE FEW AND THERE WERE MANY WHO HAD BETTER CLAIMS THAN I I WAS NOT A LONELY MAN I HAD MY DAUGHTER TO ATTEND TO MY WANTS IT IS OF THAT DAUGHTER THAT I WOULD SPEAK TO YOU SAID THE LEADER OF THE MORMONS
SO DESIRABLE IN EVERY WAY WERE THE APARTMENTS AND SO MODERATE DID THE TERMS SEEM WHEN DIVIDED BETWEEN US THAT THE BARGAIN WAS CONCLUDED UPON THE SPOT AND WE AT ONCE ENTERED INTO POSSESSION
AS I FREQUENTLY HAD OCCASION TO OBSERVE WHEN I WATCHED HIM MANIPULATING HIS FRAGILE PHILOSOPHICAL INSTRUMENTS THE READER MAY SET ME DOWN AS A HOPELESS BUSYBODY WHEN I CONFESS HOW MUCH THIS MAN STIMULATED MY CURIOSITY
THERE WAS NOT A SOUL TO BE SEEN NOR A SOUND TO BE HEARD EXCEPT THE DRIPPING OF THE RAIN WHEN I LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOW I FOUND DREBBER ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER IN A DRUNKEN SLEEP I SHOOK HIM BY THE ARM IT'S TIME TO GET OUT I SAID ALL RIGHT CABBY
HAD HE DISCOVERED A GOLD MINE GREATER DELIGHT COULD NOT HAVE SHONE UPON HIS FEATURES DOCTOR WATSON MISTER SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID STAMFORD INTRODUCING US
WE'LL FIX IT UP SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER YOU DON'T FIND YOUR FANCY KIND O LESSENING FOR THIS CHAP DO YOU
YOU ARE AT LIBERTY SIR TO GIVE YOUR ACCOUNT WHICH I AGAIN WARN YOU WILL BE TAKEN DOWN I'LL SIT DOWN WITH YOUR LEAVE THE PRISONER SAID SUITING THE ACTION TO THE WORD THIS ANEURISM OF MINE MAKES ME EASILY TIRED AND THE TUSSLE WE HAD HALF AN HOUR AGO HAS NOT MENDED MATTERS I'M ON THE BRINK OF THE GRAVE AND I AM NOT LIKELY TO LIE TO YOU
AND BOWED AS IF TO SOME APPLAUDING CROWD CONJURED UP BY HIS IMAGINATION YOU ARE TO BE CONGRATULATED I REMARKED CONSIDERABLY SURPRISED AT HIS ENTHUSIASM THERE WAS THE CASE OF VON BISCHOFF AT FRANKFORT LAST YEAR
THAT YOU AND SHE WERE NOW LYING BLANCHED SKELETONS UPON THE SIERRA BLANCO THAN THAT YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR WEAK WILLS AGAINST THE ORDERS OF THE HOLY FOUR WITH A THREATENING GESTURE OF HIS HAND HE TURNED FROM THE DOOR AND FERRIER HEARD HIS HEAVY STEP SCRUNCHING ALONG THE SHINGLY PATH
AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT THEY WERE FREE ONCE MORE I REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I EYED HIM THAT I HAD SELDOM SEEN A MORE POWERFULLY BUILT MAN AND HIS DARK SUNBURNED FACE BORE AN EXPRESSION OF DETERMINATION AND ENERGY WHICH WAS AS FORMIDABLE AS HIS PERSONAL STRENGTH
IT IS SO ANSWERED JOHN FERRIER IN RETURN FOR ALL THIS WE ASKED BUT ONE CONDITION THAT WAS THAT YOU SHOULD EMBRACE THE TRUE FAITH AND CONFORM IN EVERY WAY TO ITS USAGES THIS YOU PROMISED TO DO AND THIS IF COMMON REPORT SAYS TRULY YOU HAVE NEGLECTED
STAMFORD HAD NEVER BEEN A PARTICULAR CRONY OF MINE BUT NOW I HAILED HIM WITH ENTHUSIASM AND HE IN HIS TURN APPEARED TO BE DELIGHTED TO SEE ME IN THE EXUBERANCE OF MY JOY I ASKED HIM TO LUNCH WITH ME AT THE HOLBORN
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO RELIABLE TEST NOW WE HAVE THE SHERLOCK HOLMES TEST AND THERE WILL NO LONGER BE ANY DIFFICULTY HIS EYES FAIRLY GLITTERED AS HE SPOKE AND HE PUT HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART
YOU MUST NOT THINK I AM SULKY WHEN I DO THAT JUST LET ME ALONE AND I'LL SOON BE RIGHT WHAT HAVE YOU TO CONFESS NOW
AND WHEN AT LAST I CAME TO MYSELF AND BECAME CONVALESCENT I WAS SO WEAK AND EMACIATED THAT A MEDICAL BOARD DETERMINED THAT NOT A DAY SHOULD BE LOST IN SENDING ME BACK TO ENGLAND I WAS DISPATCHED ACCORDINGLY
PRACTICAL BUT LIMITED TELLS AT A GLANCE DIFFERENT SOILS FROM EACH OTHER AFTER WALKS HAS SHOWN ME SPLASHES UPON HIS TROUSERS AND TOLD ME BY THEIR COLOUR AND CONSISTENCE IN WHAT PART OF LONDON HE HAD RECEIVED THEM SEVEN
I DON'T CARE ABOUT KNUCKLING UNDER TO ANY MAN AS THESE FOLK DO TO THEIR DARNED PROPHET I'M A FREE BORN AMERICAN AND IT'S ALL NEW TO ME GUESS I'M TOO OLD TO LEARN IF HE COMES BROWSING ABOUT THIS FARM HE MIGHT CHANCE TO RUN UP AGAINST A CHARGE OF BUCKSHOT TRAVELLING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
NOW THE SKILFUL WORKMAN IS VERY CAREFUL INDEED AS TO WHAT HE TAKES INTO HIS BRAIN ATTIC HE WILL HAVE NOTHING BUT THE TOOLS WHICH MAY HELP HIM IN DOING HIS WORK
I WHIPPED UP MY HORSE AND KEPT WITHIN SIGHT OF THEM FEELING VERY ILL AT EASE FOR I FEARED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SHIFT THEIR QUARTERS AT EUSTON STATION THEY GOT OUT AND I LEFT A BOY TO HOLD MY HORSE AND FOLLOWED THEM ON TO THE PLATFORM
YOU MAY CONSIDER ME TO BE A MURDERER BUT I HOLD THAT I AM JUST AS MUCH AN OFFICER OF JUSTICE AS YOU ARE
COME OVER HERE NOW HE SEIZED ME BY THE COAT SLEEVE IN HIS EAGERNESS AND DREW ME OVER TO THE TABLE AT WHICH HE HAD BEEN WORKING LET US HAVE SOME FRESH BLOOD HE SAID DIGGING A LONG BODKIN INTO HIS FINGER
HE WAS CUNNING WAS STANGERSON AND ALWAYS ON HIS GUARD IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD KEEP ME OFF BY STAYING INDOORS HE WAS VERY MUCH MISTAKEN
HE HAD TO SEAL HIS MOUTH ON THE SUBJECT HOWEVER FOR TO EXPRESS AN UNORTHODOX OPINION WAS A DANGEROUS MATTER IN THOSE DAYS IN THE LAND OF THE SAINTS YES A DANGEROUS MATTER SO DANGEROUS THAT EVEN THE MOST SAINTLY DARED ONLY WHISPER THEIR RELIGIOUS OPINIONS WITH BATED BREATH
SUCH A MARRIAGE HE REGARDED AS NO MARRIAGE AT ALL BUT AS A SHAME AND A DISGRACE WHATEVER HE MIGHT THINK OF THE MORMON DOCTRINES UPON THAT ONE POINT HE WAS INFLEXIBLE
DRIVE ME TO HALLIDAY'S PRIVATE HOTEL SAID HE WHEN I HAD HIM FAIRLY INSIDE MY CAB MY HEART JUMPED SO WITH JOY THAT I FEARED LEST AT THIS LAST MOMENT MY ANEURISM MIGHT GO WRONG I DROVE ALONG SLOWLY WEIGHING IN MY OWN MIND WHAT IT WAS BEST TO DO I MIGHT TAKE HIM RIGHT OUT INTO THE COUNTRY
HE WAS QUIET IN HIS WAYS AND HIS HABITS WERE REGULAR IT WAS RARE FOR HIM TO BE UP AFTER TEN AT NIGHT AND HE HAD INVARIABLY BREAKFASTED AND GONE OUT BEFORE I ROSE IN THE MORNING
LEST SOMETHING WHICH FELL FROM THEIR LIPS MIGHT BE MISCONSTRUED AND BRING DOWN A SWIFT RETRIBUTION UPON THEM THE VICTIMS OF PERSECUTION HAD NOW TURNED PERSECUTORS ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AND PERSECUTORS OF THE MOST TERRIBLE DESCRIPTION NOT THE INQUISITION OF SEVILLE NOR THE GERMAN VEHM GERICHT
THOUGH HE CAN BE COMMUNICATIVE ENOUGH WHEN THE FANCY SEIZES HIM I SHOULD LIKE TO MEET HIM I SAID IF I AM TO LODGE WITH ANYONE I SHOULD PREFER A MAN OF STUDIOUS AND QUIET HABITS
AND THAT IF THE OTHER WOULD WAIT FOR HIM HE WOULD SOON REJOIN HIM HIS COMPANION REMONSTRATED WITH HIM AND REMINDED HIM THAT THEY HAD RESOLVED TO STICK TOGETHER DREBBER ANSWERED THAT THE MATTER WAS A DELICATE ONE AND THAT HE MUST GO ALONE I COULD NOT CATCH WHAT STANGERSON SAID TO THAT
WITH WHOM I SERVED AT THE FATAL BATTLE OF MAIWAND THERE I WAS STRUCK ON THE SHOULDER
HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN HUNG HAD THIS TEST BEEN IN EXISTENCE THEN THERE WAS MASON OF BRADFORD AND THE NOTORIOUS MULLER AND LEFEVRE OF MONTPELLIER AND SAMSON OF NEW ORLEANS
RUMOURS OF MURDERED IMMIGRANTS AND RIFLED CAMPS IN REGIONS WHERE INDIANS HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN FRESH WOMEN APPEARED IN THE HAREMS OF THE ELDERS WOMEN WHO PINED AND WEPT AND BORE UPON THEIR FACES THE TRACES OF AN UNEXTINGUISHABLE HORROR
AND WHICH WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSE BY JOVE I CRIED IF HE REALLY WANTS SOMEONE TO SHARE THE ROOMS AND THE EXPENSE I AM THE VERY MAN FOR HIM I SHOULD PREFER HAVING A PARTNER TO BEING ALONE
VERY RIGHT TOO YES BUT IT MAY BE PUSHED TO EXCESS WHEN IT COMES TO BEATING THE SUBJECTS IN THE DISSECTING ROOMS WITH A STICK IT IS CERTAINLY TAKING RATHER A BIZARRE SHAPE BEATING THE SUBJECTS
WAITING TO SEE WHICH WAS TO LIVE AND WHICH WAS TO DIE SHALL I EVER FORGET THE LOOK WHICH CAME OVER HIS FACE WHEN THE FIRST WARNING PANGS TOLD HIM THAT THE POISON WAS IN HIS SYSTEM
IF THERE'S A VACANT PLACE FOR A CHIEF OF THE POLICE I RECKON YOU ARE THE MAN FOR IT
AND I NEEDED NO GUIDING AS WE ASCENDED THE BLEAK STONE STAIRCASE AND MADE OUR WAY DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR WITH ITS VISTA OF WHITEWASHED WALL AND DUN COLOURED DOORS NEAR THE FURTHER END A LOW ARCHED PASSAGE BRANCHED AWAY FROM IT
HAS A GOOD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BRITISH LAW WHEN I HAD GOT SO FAR IN MY LIST I THREW IT INTO THE FIRE IN DESPAIR IF I CAN ONLY FIND WHAT THE FELLOW IS DRIVING AT BY RECONCILING ALL THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
THIS WAS A LOFTY CHAMBER LINED AND LITTERED WITH COUNTLESS BOTTLES BROAD LOW TABLES WERE SCATTERED ABOUT WHICH BRISTLED WITH RETORTS TEST TUBES
AND DISCOVERING A CALLING WHICH NEEDS THEM ALL I SAID TO MYSELF I MAY AS WELL GIVE UP THE ATTEMPT AT ONCE I SEE THAT I HAVE ALLUDED ABOVE TO HIS POWERS UPON THE VIOLIN THESE WERE VERY REMARKABLE
OR TO DESIRE THEY WERE RICH AND I WAS POOR SO THAT IT WAS NO EASY MATTER FOR ME TO FOLLOW THEM WHEN I GOT TO LONDON MY POCKET WAS ABOUT EMPTY AND I FOUND THAT I MUST TURN MY HAND TO SOMETHING FOR MY LIVING DRIVING AND RIDING ARE AS NATURAL TO ME AS WALKING
YET HIS ZEAL FOR CERTAIN STUDIES WAS REMARKABLE AND WITHIN ECCENTRIC LIMITS HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS SO EXTRAORDINARILY AMPLE AND MINUTE THAT HIS OBSERVATIONS HAVE FAIRLY ASTOUNDED ME SURELY NO MAN WOULD WORK SO HARD
NEITHER DID HE APPEAR TO HAVE PURSUED ANY COURSE OF READING
HE WAS STILL SITTING WITH HIS ELBOWS UPON HIS KNEES CONSIDERING HOW HE SHOULD BROACH THE MATTER TO HIS DAUGHTER WHEN A SOFT HAND WAS LAID UPON HIS AND LOOKING UP HE SAW HER STANDING BESIDE HIM ONE GLANCE AT HER PALE FRIGHTENED FACE SHOWED HIM THAT SHE HAD HEARD WHAT HAD PASSED
OR THAT I MUST MAKE A COMPLETE ALTERATION IN MY STYLE OF LIVING CHOOSING THE LATTER ALTERNATIVE I BEGAN BY MAKING UP MY MIND TO LEAVE THE HOTEL
ON THAT THE SECRETARY GAVE IT UP AS A BAD JOB AND SIMPLY BARGAINED WITH HIM THAT IF HE MISSED THE LAST TRAIN HE SHOULD REJOIN HIM AT HALLIDAY'S PRIVATE HOTEL
A WHOLE SERIES OF MY FAVOURITE AIRS AS A SLIGHT COMPENSATION FOR THE TRIAL UPON MY PATIENCE DURING THE FIRST WEEK OR SO WE HAD NO CALLERS AND I HAD BEGUN TO THINK THAT MY COMPANION WAS AS FRIENDLESS A MAN AS I WAS MYSELF
BUT THE FARM WE WILL RAISE AS MUCH AS WE CAN IN MONEY AND LET THE REST GO
HE STAGGERED BACK WITH A LIVID FACE AND I SAW THE PERSPIRATION BREAK OUT UPON HIS BROW WHILE HIS TEETH CHATTERED IN HIS HEAD AT THE SIGHT I LEANED MY BACK AGAINST THE DOOR AND LAUGHED LOUD AND LONG I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT VENGEANCE WOULD BE SWEET BUT I HAD NEVER HOPED FOR THE CONTENTMENT OF SOUL WHICH NOW POSSESSED ME
NOT TO HAVE USELESS FACTS ELBOWING OUT THE USEFUL ONES BUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM I PROTESTED WHAT THE DEUCE IS IT TO ME HE INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY YOU SAY THAT WE GO ROUND THE SUN IF WE WENT ROUND THE MOON
MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE WHO WOULD COME FORTH AT NIGHT WITH FIRE AND SWORD TO EXACT A TERRIBLE REPARATION HENCE EVERY MAN FEARED HIS NEIGHBOUR AND NONE SPOKE OF THE THINGS WHICH WERE NEAREST HIS HEART ONE FINE MORNING JOHN FERRIER WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT TO HIS WHEATFIELDS
AND HOW OFTEN I ENDEAVOURED TO BREAK THROUGH THE RETICENCE WHICH HE SHOWED ON ALL THAT CONCERNED HIMSELF BEFORE PRONOUNCING JUDGMENT HOWEVER BE IT REMEMBERED HOW OBJECTLESS WAS MY LIFE AND HOW LITTLE THERE WAS TO ENGAGE MY ATTENTION
YES I AM I ANSWERED THEN PUT YOUR HAND HERE HE SAID WITH A SMILE MOTIONING WITH HIS MANACLED WRISTS TOWARDS HIS CHEST I DID SO AND BECAME AT ONCE CONSCIOUS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY THROBBING AND COMMOTION WHICH WAS GOING ON INSIDE
SOMETIMES IN THE DISSECTING ROOMS AND OCCASIONALLY IN LONG WALKS WHICH APPEARED TO TAKE HIM INTO THE LOWEST PORTIONS OF THE CITY NOTHING COULD EXCEED HIS ENERGY WHEN THE WORKING FIT WAS UPON HIM BUT NOW AND AGAIN
SOMETIMES THE CHORDS WERE SONOROUS AND MELANCHOLY OCCASIONALLY THEY WERE FANTASTIC AND CHEERFUL CLEARLY THEY REFLECTED THE THOUGHTS WHICH POSSESSED HIM BUT WHETHER THE MUSIC AIDED THOSE THOUGHTS
UNLESS HE HAS SOME VERY GOOD REASON FOR DOING SO HIS IGNORANCE WAS AS REMARKABLE AS HIS KNOWLEDGE OF CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS HE APPEARED TO KNOW NEXT TO NOTHING
HERE I RALLIED AND HAD ALREADY IMPROVED SO FAR AS TO BE ABLE TO WALK ABOUT THE WARDS AND EVEN TO BASK A LITTLE UPON THE VERANDAH WHEN I WAS STRUCK DOWN BY ENTERIC FEVER THAT CURSE OF OUR INDIAN POSSESSIONS
IT IS A MISTAKE TO THINK THAT THAT LITTLE ROOM HAS ELASTIC WALLS AND CAN DISTEND TO ANY EXTENT DEPEND UPON IT THERE COMES A TIME WHEN FOR EVERY ADDITION OF KNOWLEDGE YOU FORGET SOMETHING THAT YOU KNEW BEFORE IT IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE THEREFORE
JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET THREE WEEKS HAD PASSED SINCE JEFFERSON HOPE AND HIS COMRADES HAD DEPARTED FROM SALT LAKE CITY JOHN FERRIER'S HEART WAS SORE WITHIN HIM WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN'S RETURN AND OF THE IMPENDING LOSS OF HIS ADOPTED CHILD
AND I NOTICED THAT IT WAS ALL MOTTLED OVER WITH SIMILAR PIECES OF PLASTER AND DISCOLOURED WITH STRONG ACIDS WE CAME HERE ON BUSINESS SAID STAMFORD SITTING DOWN ON A HIGH THREE LEGGED STOOL AND PUSHING ANOTHER ONE IN MY DIRECTION WITH HIS FOOT
WE RATTLED ACROSS WATERLOO BRIDGE AND THROUGH MILES OF STREETS UNTIL TO MY ASTONISHMENT WE FOUND OURSELVES BACK IN THE TERRACE IN WHICH HE HAD BOARDED I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT HIS INTENTION WAS IN RETURNING THERE
THE CAMPAIGN BROUGHT HONOURS AND PROMOTION TO MANY BUT FOR ME IT HAD NOTHING BUT MISFORTUNE AND DISASTER I WAS REMOVED FROM MY BRIGADE
THINKING THAT I MIGHT HAVE DROPPED IT WHEN I STOOPED OVER DREBBER'S BODY I DROVE BACK AND LEAVING MY CAB IN A SIDE STREET I WENT BOLDLY UP TO THE HOUSE
YOU SEEM TO BE A WALKING CALENDAR OF CRIME SAID STAMFORD WITH A LAUGH YOU MIGHT START A PAPER ON THOSE LINES CALL IT THE POLICE NEWS OF THE PAST
BUT WE HAVEN'T OPPOSED HIM YET HER FATHER ANSWERED IT WILL BE TIME TO LOOK OUT FOR SQUALLS WHEN WE DO WE HAVE A CLEAR MONTH BEFORE US AT THE END OF THAT I GUESS WE HAD BEST SHIN OUT OF UTAH LEAVE UTAH THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT
MY INTEREST IN HIM AND MY CURIOSITY AS TO HIS AIMS IN LIFE GRADUALLY DEEPENED AND INCREASED HIS VERY PERSON AND APPEARANCE WERE SUCH AS TO STRIKE THE ATTENTION OF THE MOST CASUAL OBSERVER
THIS MUST BE THE GOSSIP OF IDLE TONGUES WHAT IS THE THIRTEENTH RULE IN THE CODE OF THE SAINTED JOSEPH SMITH
I EAGERLY HAILED THE LITTLE MYSTERY WHICH HUNG AROUND MY COMPANION AND SPENT MUCH OF MY TIME IN ENDEAVOURING TO UNRAVEL IT HE WAS NOT STUDYING MEDICINE HE HAD HIMSELF IN REPLY TO A QUESTION
PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT CARE FOR HIM AS A CONSTANT COMPANION WHY WHAT IS THERE AGAINST HIM
HOW ARE YOU HE SAID CORDIALLY GRIPPING MY HAND WITH A STRENGTH FOR WHICH I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE GIVEN HIM CREDIT YOU HAVE BEEN IN AFGHANISTAN I PERCEIVE HOW ON EARTH DID YOU KNOW THAT I ASKED IN ASTONISHMENT NEVER MIND SAID HE CHUCKLING TO HIMSELF
HE COWERED AWAY WITH WILD CRIES AND PRAYERS FOR MERCY BUT I DREW MY KNIFE AND HELD IT TO HIS THROAT UNTIL HE HAD OBEYED ME
WE SHALL DRIVE ROUND TOGETHER AFTER LUNCHEON CERTAINLY I ANSWERED AND THE CONVERSATION DRIFTED AWAY INTO OTHER CHANNELS AS WE MADE OUR WAY TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER LEAVING THE HOLBORN
WHO WAS BENDING OVER A DISTANT TABLE ABSORBED IN HIS WORK AT THE SOUND OF OUR STEPS HE GLANCED ROUND AND SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH A CRY OF PLEASURE I'VE FOUND IT I'VE FOUND IT HE SHOUTED TO MY COMPANION RUNNING TOWARDS US WITH A TEST TUBE IN HIS HAND
THAT GIRL THAT I SPOKE OF WAS TO HAVE MARRIED ME TWENTY YEARS AGO SHE WAS FORCED INTO MARRYING THAT SAME DREBBER AND BROKE HER HEART OVER IT I TOOK THE MARRIAGE RING FROM HER DEAD FINGER AND I VOWED THAT HIS DYING EYES SHOULD REST UPON THAT VERY RING AND THAT HIS LAST THOUGHTS SHOULD BE OF THE CRIME FOR WHICH HE WAS PUNISHED
I LAUGHED AT THIS CROSS EXAMINATION I KEEP A BULL PUP I SAID AND I OBJECT TO ROWS BECAUSE MY NERVES ARE SHAKEN AND I GET UP AT ALL SORTS OF UNGODLY HOURS AND I AM EXTREMELY LAZY
BUT DREBBER WAS RATHER PLEASED THAN OTHERWISE I GOT SO CLOSE TO THEM IN THE BUSTLE THAT I COULD HEAR EVERY WORD THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM
OH A MYSTERY IS IT I CRIED RUBBING MY HANDS THIS IS VERY PIQUANT I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER THE PROPER STUDY OF MANKIND IS MAN YOU KNOW
THAT YOU HAVE SOME REASON FOR WASHING YOUR HANDS OF THE MATTER IS THIS FELLOW'S TEMPER SO FORMIDABLE OR WHAT IS IT DON'T BE MEALY MOUTHED ABOUT IT IT IS NOT EASY TO EXPRESS THE INEXPRESSIBLE HE ANSWERED WITH A LAUGH
IT WAS BUT FOR A MOMENT FOR THE ACTION OF THE ALKALOID IS RAPID A SPASM OF PAIN CONTORTED HIS FEATURES HE THREW HIS HANDS OUT IN FRONT OF HIM STAGGERED AND THEN WITH A HOARSE CRY FELL HEAVILY UPON THE FLOOR I TURNED HIM OVER WITH MY FOOT AND PLACED MY HAND UPON HIS HEART THERE WAS NO MOVEMENT HE WAS DEAD
THIS BEING SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU WHO PROFESS THE HOLY CREED SHOULD SUFFER YOUR DAUGHTER TO VIOLATE IT JOHN FERRIER MADE NO ANSWER BUT HE PLAYED NERVOUSLY WITH HIS RIDING WHIP
I HAVE ANOTHER SET OF VICES WHEN I'M WELL BUT THOSE ARE THE PRINCIPAL ONES AT PRESENT
HE WOULD SELDOM PRODUCE ANY MUSIC OR ATTEMPT ANY RECOGNIZED AIR LEANING BACK IN HIS ARM CHAIR OF AN EVENING HE WOULD CLOSE HIS EYES
I WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT ESCAPE ME AGAIN THEY WERE VERY NEAR DOING IT FOR ALL THAT GO WHERE THEY WOULD ABOUT LONDON I WAS ALWAYS AT THEIR HEELS SOMETIMES I FOLLOWED THEM ON MY CAB AND SOMETIMES ON FOOT
IN THE TROOPSHIP ORONTES AND LANDED A MONTH LATER ON PORTSMOUTH JETTY WITH MY HEALTH IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED BUT WITH PERMISSION FROM A PATERNAL GOVERNMENT TO SPEND THE NEXT NINE MONTHS IN ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE IT
THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR HAD BROKEN OUT ON LANDING AT BOMBAY I LEARNED THAT MY CORPS HAD ADVANCED THROUGH THE PASSES AND WAS ALREADY DEEP IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY I FOLLOWED HOWEVER
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF LUCY FERRIER NOW I CRIED LOCKING THE DOOR AND SHAKING THE KEY IN HIS FACE PUNISHMENT HAS BEEN SLOW IN COMING BUT IT HAS OVERTAKEN YOU AT LAST
THE HARDEST JOB WAS TO LEARN MY WAY ABOUT FOR I RECKON THAT OF ALL THE MAZES THAT EVER WERE CONTRIVED THIS CITY IS THE MOST CONFUSING I HAD A MAP BESIDE ME THOUGH AND WHEN ONCE I HAD SPOTTED THE PRINCIPAL HOTELS AND STATIONS I GOT ON PRETTY WELL IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE I FOUND OUT WHERE MY TWO GENTLEMEN WERE LIVING
AND EXPRESSED HIS HOPES THAT HE HAD NOT HURT ANY OF US IN THE SCUFFLE
A REACTION WOULD SEIZE HIM AND FOR DAYS ON END HE WOULD LIE UPON THE SOFA IN THE SITTING ROOM HARDLY UTTERING A WORD OR MOVING A MUSCLE FROM MORNING TO NIGHT ON THESE OCCASIONS I HAVE NOTICED SUCH A DREAMY VACANT EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES
I EVEN TOOK A PENCIL AND JOTTED THEM DOWN I COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE DOCUMENT WHEN I HAD COMPLETED IT IT RAN IN THIS WAY SHERLOCK HOLMES HIS LIMITS ONE
BELATED WANDERERS UPON THE MOUNTAINS SPOKE OF GANGS OF ARMED MEN MASKED STEALTHY AND NOISELESS WHO FLITTED BY THEM IN THE DARKNESS THESE TALES AND RUMOURS TOOK SUBSTANCE AND SHAPE AND WERE CORROBORATED AND RE CORROBORATED UNTIL THEY RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO A DEFINITE NAME
YOU APPEAR TO BE ASTONISHED HE SAID SMILING AT MY EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE NOW THAT I DO KNOW IT I SHALL DO MY BEST TO FORGET IT TO FORGET IT YOU SEE HE EXPLAINED
I GAVE HIM A SHORT SKETCH OF MY ADVENTURES AND HAD HARDLY CONCLUDED IT BY THE TIME THAT WE REACHED OUR DESTINATION POOR DEVIL HE SAID COMMISERATINGLY AFTER HE HAD LISTENED TO MY MISFORTUNES
UPON MY QUOTING THOMAS CARLYLE HE INQUIRED IN THE NAIVEST WAY WHO HE MIGHT BE AND WHAT HE HAD DONE MY SURPRISE REACHED A CLIMAX HOWEVER WHEN I FOUND INCIDENTALLY THAT HE WAS IGNORANT OF THE COPERNICAN THEORY
IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I TOOK MY DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF MEDICINE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON AND PROCEEDED TO NETLEY TO GO THROUGH THE COURSE PRESCRIBED FOR SURGEONS IN THE ARMY
WHO APPEARED TO ME TO BE MUCH EXCITED AND WHO WAS CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A SLIP SHOD ELDERLY WOMAN ON ANOTHER OCCASION AN OLD WHITE HAIRED GENTLEMAN HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH MY COMPANION AND ON ANOTHER A RAILWAY PORTER
WHICH HE HAD EXTRACTED FROM SOME SOUTH AMERICAN ARROW POISON AND WHICH WAS SO POWERFUL THAT THE LEAST GRAIN MEANT INSTANT DEATH
THE TRUE BELIEVERS HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS TO YOU WE PICKED YOU UP WHEN YOU WERE STARVING IN THE DESERT WE SHARED OUR FOOD WITH YOU LED YOU SAFE TO THE CHOSEN VALLEY GAVE YOU A GOODLY SHARE OF LAND AND ALLOWED YOU TO WAX RICH UNDER OUR PROTECTION IS NOT THIS SO
AND OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM THAT ANY CIVILIZED HUMAN BEING IN THIS NINETEENTH CENTURY SHOULD NOT BE AWARE THAT THE EARTH TRAVELLED ROUND THE SUN APPEARED TO BE TO ME SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY FACT THAT I COULD HARDLY REALIZE IT
FIVE BOTANY VARIABLE WELL UP IN BELLADONNA OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING SIX GEOLOGY
THE CONTENTS ASSUMED A DULL MAHOGANY COLOUR AND A BROWNISH DUST WAS PRECIPITATED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS JAR HA HA HE CRIED CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND LOOKING AS DELIGHTED AS A CHILD WITH A NEW TOY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT
AND WE STARTED OFF TOGETHER IN A HANSOM WHATEVER HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WITH YOURSELF WATSON HE ASKED IN UNDISGUISED WONDER AS WE RATTLED THROUGH THE CROWDED LONDON STREETS
HE IS A LITTLE QUEER IN HIS IDEAS AN ENTHUSIAST IN SOME BRANCHES OF SCIENCE AS FAR AS I KNOW HE IS A DECENT FELLOW ENOUGH A MEDICAL STUDENT I SUPPOSE SAID I NO
I CONSIDER THAT A MAN'S BRAIN ORIGINALLY IS LIKE A LITTLE EMPTY ATTIC AND YOU HAVE TO STOCK IT WITH SUCH FURNITURE AS YOU CHOOSE A FOOL TAKES IN ALL THE LUMBER OF EVERY SORT THAT HE COMES ACROSS SO THAT THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HIM GETS CROWDED OUT
AND BROWNISH STAINS DISCOVERED UPON THEM ARE THEY BLOOD STAINS OR MUD STAINS OR RUST STAINS OR FRUIT STAINS OR WHAT ARE THEY THAT IS A QUESTION WHICH HAS PUZZLED MANY AN EXPERT AND WHY
HOLMES IS A LITTLE TOO SCIENTIFIC FOR MY TASTES IT APPROACHES TO COLD BLOODEDNESS I COULD IMAGINE HIS GIVING A FRIEND A LITTLE PINCH OF THE LATEST VEGETABLE ALKALOID NOT OUT OF MALEVOLENCE YOU UNDERSTAND BUT
LOR SIR SHE EXCLAIMED IN UNDISGUISED ASTONISHMENT DO YOU WANT THOSE ANIMALS IN YOUR ROOM WANT THE PIGLING
I SHOULD CERTAINLY SEND FOR YOU TO FRIGHTEN THEM OUT YOU SHOO BEAUTIFULLY MEANWHILE DO YOU MIND TRYING TO DRIVE THAT OX AWAY THAT
IS JUST AS PERFUNCTORY AND CONVENTIONAL AS THE COUNTERFOIL BUSINESS WOULD BE ONLY TEN TIMES MORE TIRESOME AND BRAIN RACKING YOUR PLAN WOULD CERTAINLY BRING THE IDEAL OF A HAPPY CHRISTMAS A STEP NEARER REALISATION SAID JANETTA
ADMITTED ESHLEY BUT I CANNOT CLAIM TO HAVE HAD ANY EXPERIENCE IN ROUNDING UP STRAY OXEN IVE SEEN IT DONE ON A CINEMA FILM OF COURSE BUT THERE WERE ALWAYS HORSES AND LOTS OF OTHER ACCESSORIES BESIDES
IN A SETTING OF WALNUT TREE AND MEADOW GRASS AND FILTERED SUNBEAM AND THE ROYAL ACADEMY HAD DULY EXPOSED THE SAME ON THE WALLS OF ITS SUMMER EXHIBITION THE ROYAL ACADEMY ENCOURAGES ORDERLY
THESE SHOULD BE SWEPT AWAY TO GIVE THE SEASON A CHANCE OF BEING REALLY FESTIVE A TIME OF UNTROUBLED UNPUNCTUATED PEACE AND GOOD WILL BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SOME ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF PRESENTS RECEIVED OBJECTED JANETTA OTHERWISE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER KNOW WHETHER THEY HAD ARRIVED SAFELY
IT WAS IN THE REALM OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS THAT A STARTLING CHANGE TOOK PLACE BLUNT FORCIBLE OUTSPOKEN ARTICLES APPEARED

THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HUMAN LIFE WHERE IS THE EDITOR OR THE FOREIGN EDITOR OR THE CHIEF LEADER WRITER OR ANYBODY IN ANSWER TO THE SHOWER OF QUESTIONS
THE FEATHERED COMBATANT HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE WHEN HARD PRESSED TO TAKE REFUGE ON THE BED AND FREELY AVAILED HIMSELF OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THE PIGLING NEVER QUITE SUCCEEDED IN HURLING HIMSELF ON TO THE SAME EMINENCE BUT IT WAS NOT FROM WANT OF TRYING
BIT OF COAST SCENERY BY TUKE TWO OF THE BOYS ARE WEARING YOUR MELTON OVERCOAT I HOPE YOU DONT MIND ITS A NEW OVERCOAT SAID LATIMER WITH EVERY INDICATION OF MINDING DREADFULLY YOULL TAKE
STEPPED WITH MUCH PRECAUTION OUT OF THE MORNING ROOM STARED WITH GRAVE INQUIRY AT THE NO LONGER OBTRUSIVE AND PEA STICK THROWING HUMAN AND THEN LUMBERED HEAVILY BUT SWIFTLY OUT OF THE GARDEN
FOR THE JOURNEY THERE AND BACK THIS WAS IN MANY RESPECTS THE MOST REMARKABLE OF ALL THE PRESS STAMPEDES THAT WERE EXPERIENCED AT THIS TIME THERE WAS NO MAKE BELIEVE ABOUT THE UNDERTAKING PROPRIETOR MANAGER
EMMA HAD COME TO THE FARM FULL OF PLANS FOR LITTLE REFORMS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PART THE RESULT OF TRAINING IN THE NEWEST WAYS AND METHODS IN PART THE OUTCOME OF HER OWN IDEAS AND FANCIES REFORMS IN THE KITCHEN REGION
WHAT TROUBLE DID THEY TAKE TO FIND OUT WHETHER WE READ WORDSWORTH WITH GLADNESS FOR ALL THEY KNEW OR CARED WE MIGHT BE FRANTICALLY EMBEDDED IN THE BELIEF THAT ALL POETRY BEGINS AND ENDS WITH JOHN MASEFIELD AND IT MIGHT INFURIATE OR DEPRESS US TO HAVE A DAILY SAMPLE OF WORDSWORTHIAN PRODUCTS FLUNG AT US
THERE HAD BEEN A PALMERSTON THAT HAD BEEN A NAME DOWN TIVERTON WAY TIVERTON WAS NOT A FAR JOURNEY AS THE CROW FLIES BUT TO MARTHA IT WAS ALMOST A FOREIGN COUNTRY LATER THERE HAD BEEN NORTHCOTES AND ACLANDS AND MANY OTHER NEWER NAMES THAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN
PEOPLE BEGAN TO TALK UNKINDLY OF THE EFFECT OF HIGH ALTITUDES AND EASTERN ATMOSPHERE ON MINDS AND TEMPERAMENTS UNUSED TO SUCH LUXURIES THE YARKAND MANNER
AND PASSED TO THE RABBIT SHOOTING COUSIN AS THE NEXT OF KIN EMMA LADBRUK DRIFTED OUT OF ITS HISTORY AS A BEE THAT HAD WANDERED IN AT AN OPEN WINDOW MIGHT FLIT ITS WAY OUT AGAIN ON A COLD GREY MORNING SHE STOOD WAITING
EVIDENTLY SOMETHING MORE THAN A MANS FIRM HAND WAS NEEDED TO DEAL WITH THE CASE LATIMER SLIPPED OUT OF BED IN SEARCH OF A WEAPON OF DISSUASION
HEAVENS IVE JUST REMEMBERED MISSUS STEPHEN LUDBERRY I HAVENT THANKED HER FOR WHAT SHE SENT WHAT DID SHE SEND I FORGET I THINK IT WAS A CALENDAR THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE
OVERWORKED OFFICE BOY WHO WAS THE ONE CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THE EDITORIAL BRAIN AND THE BUSINESS DEPARTMENTS OF THE PAPER SARDONICALLY EXPLAINED THE NEW ALOOFNESS AS THE YARKAND MANNER MOST OF THE REPORTERS
ONE OF THEM I BELIEVE IS STILL LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE TIGRIS VALLEY
SHE MAY BE JUST DOZING OFF INTO A MERCIFUL SLEEP AND YOUR OUTCRY WILL WAKEN HER CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS SHOULD BE THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE OF PEOPLE IN OUR STATION OF LIFE
AND IT TOOK THE GOVERNMENT A CONSIDERABLE TIME AND MUCH TROUBLE TO RECLAIM THEM FROM THEIR FRUITLESS QUESTS ALONG THE BANKS OF THE OXUS THE GOBI DESERT THE ORENBURG STEPPE AND OTHER OUTLANDISH PLACES
IMPRISONED WITHIN HIGH BLANK WALLS WAS NOT A ROOM THAT LENT ITSELF READILY EITHER TO COMFORT OR DECORATION WHEN WE ARE MORE SETTLED I SHALL WORK WONDERS IN THE WAY OF MAKING THE KITCHEN HABITABLE SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN TO HER OCCASIONAL VISITORS
IN COMPARISON WITH THE OX A HUGE MOTTLED BRUTE DULL RED ABOUT THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS PASSING TO DIRTY WHITE ON THE FLANKS AND HIND QUARTERS WITH SHAGGY EARS AND LARGE BLOOD SHOT EYES
HE SAID MARTHA MEANS TO LIVE TO A HUNDRED SHE TOLD ME SO AND SHELL DO IT SHE MAY BE ACTUALLY DYING AT THIS MOMENT OR IT MAY JUST BE THE BEGINNING OF THE BREAK UP PERSISTED EMMA WITH A FEELING OF CONTEMPT FOR THE SLOWNESS AND DULNESS OF THE YOUNG MAN
LATIMER SPRINGFIELD WAS A RATHER CHEERLESS OLDISH YOUNG MAN WHO WENT INTO POLITICS SOMEWHAT IN THE SPIRIT IN WHICH OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT GO INTO HALF MOURNING

OF A BEE WANDERING IN AT A WINDOW ON A SUMMERS DAY USED AT FIRST TO WATCH HER WITH A KIND OF FRIGHTENED CURIOSITY SHE WAS SO OLD AND SO MUCH A PART OF THE PLACE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO THINK OF HER EXACTLY AS A LIVING THING OLD SHEP

HIS REMARKABLE PICTURE OX IN A MORNING ROOM LATE AUTUMN WAS ONE OF THE SENSATIONS AND SUCCESSES OF THE NEXT PARIS SALON AND WHEN IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXHIBITED AT MUNICH IT WAS BOUGHT BY THE BAVARIAN GOVERNMENT
AND MISSUS DURMOT HAD BEEN REASONABLY NEAR THE MARK IN ASSERTING THAT HE WAS WORKING AT HIGH PRESSURE OVER THIS ELECTION THE RESTFUL LULL WHICH HIS HOSTESS ENFORCED ON HIM WAS DECIDEDLY WELCOME AND YET
SAID VERA WHICH WAS OF COURSE
THE NAMES CHANGED BUT IT WAS ALWAYS LIBRULS AND TOORIES YELLOWS AND BLUES AND THEY ALWAYS QUARRELLED AND SHOUTED AS TO WHO WAS RIGHT AND WHO WAS WRONG THE ONE THEY QUARRELLED ABOUT MOST WAS A FINE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH AN ANGRY FACESHE
THE ENSUING PEACE WAS LOCAL AND SHORT LIVED THE DEFLECTED ENERGIES OF THE GAMECOCK FOUND NEW OUTLET IN A SUDDEN AND SUSTAINED ATTACK ON THE SLEEPING AND TEMPORARILY INOFFENSIVE PIGLING AND THE DUEL WHICH FOLLOWED WAS DESPERATE AND EMBITTERED BEYOND ANY POSSIBILITY OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION

WHAT COBDENISM MIGHT DO FOR THE CAMEL INDUSTRY RANKS AMONG THE BEST OF THE RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO FREE TRADE LITERATURE WHILE THE VIEWS ON FOREIGN POLICY ENUNCIATED FROM A ROOF IN YARKAND

ADELA PINGSFORD USED LANGUAGE THAT SENT THE ARTIST INSTINCTIVELY A FEW FEET NEARER TO THE OX HE PICKED UP A PEA STICK AND FLUNG IT WITH SOME DETERMINATION AGAINST THE ANIMALS MOTTLED FLANKS
THE FACT OF A LEADING ORGAN OF EVANGELICAL THOUGHT BEING EDITED FOR TWO SUCCESSIVE FORTNIGHTS FROM TROUVILLE AND MONTE CARLO WAS GENERALLY ADMITTED TO HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE AND EVEN WHEN

IF THOSE DEAF OLD EARS COULD HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO GIVE THEM EVEN A HEARING WOULD HAVE MET WITH SHORT SHRIFT AND SCORNFUL REJECTION AND THE KITCHEN REGION SPREAD OVER THE ZONE OF DAIRY AND MARKET BUSINESS AND HALF THE WORK OF THE HOUSEHOLD
SAID LATIMER WITH THE INSTINCT OF A PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE FOR GETTING INTO THE LOCAL LIMELIGHT WE CANT SAID VERA DECIDEDLY WE HAVENT ANY BOATS AND WERE CUT OFF BY A RAGING TORRENT FROM ANY HUMAN HABITATION

HAD ONCE BEEN A MERRY NOISY CHILD PLAYING ABOUT IN LANES AND HAY LOFTS AND FARMHOUSE GARRETS THAT HAD BEEN EIGHTY ODD YEARS AGO AND NOW SHE WAS JUST A FRAIL OLD BODY COWERING UNDER THE APPROACHING CHILL OF THE DEATH THAT WAS COMING AT LAST TO TAKE HER

THAT THE CHARITABLE CALLED THE CROQUET LAWN AND PUSHED ITS WAY THROUGH THE OPEN FRENCH WINDOW INTO THE MORNING ROOM

SPORTING BLUFF AND THE DAMSELS OWN PAPER ALL PITCHED ON KHARTOUM FOR THE SAME WEEK IT WAS PERHAPS A DESIRE TO OUT DISTANCE ALL POSSIBLE COMPETITION THAT INFLUENCED THE MANAGEMENT
EMMA USED TO THINK TO HERSELF WHAT GENERATIONS OF GHOST DOGS THERE MUST BE OUT ON THOSE HILLS THAT MARTHA HAD REARED AND FED AND TENDED AND SPOKEN A LAST GOOD BYE WORD TO IN THAT OLD KITCHEN
WHAT HAD BEEN A FAIRLY ARDUOUS JOURNEY THE AFORETIME STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE WAS SCARCELY MAINTAINED BUT AT ANY RATE THE GENERAL LINES OF POLICY AND OUTLOOK WERE NOT DEPARTED FROM
WHO DIVIDED HIS TIME BETWEEN AMATEUR HORSE DEALING RABBIT SHOOTING AND FLIRTING WITH THE FARM MAIDS IM AFRAID OLD MARTHA IS DYING SAID EMMA JIM WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON TO WHOM ONE HAD TO BREAK NEWS GENTLY NONSENSE

IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED LIKE A WITHERED STALK STANDING AMID A RIOTOUS GROWTH OF GAILY HUED FLOWERS BUT SHE THREW THE GRAIN DEFTLY AMID THE WILDERNESS OF BEAKS
SHOWED AT LEAST AS MUCH GRASP OF THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION AS THOSE THAT HAD GERMINATED WITHIN HALF A MILE OF DOWNING STREET QUITE IN KEEPING TOO WITH THE OLDER AND BETTER TRADITIONS OF BRITISH JOURNALISM WAS THE MANNER OF THE HOME COMING
IF MISS VERAS DOG SEES THAT PIG EXCLAIMED THE MAID AND HURRIED OFF TO AVERT SUCH A CATASTROPHE A COLD SUSPICION WAS STEALING OVER LATIMERS MIND HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND DREW UP THE BLIND
ITS EATING A CHRYSANTHEMUM SAID ESHLEY AT LAST WHEN THE SILENCE HAD BECOME UNBEARABLE HOW OBSERVANT YOU ARE SAID ADELA BITTERLY YOU SEEM TO NOTICE EVERYTHING AS A MATTER OF FACT
GOING ALONG SLUSHY COUNTRY ROADS AND SPEAKING TO DAMP AUDIENCES IN DRAUGHTY SCHOOLROOMS DAY AFTER DAY FOR A FORTNIGHT HELL HAVE TO PUT IN AN APPEARANCE AT SOME PLACE OF WORSHIP ON SUNDAY MORNING AND HE CAN COME TO US IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
METHODICAL HABITS IN ITS CHILDREN ESHLEY HAD PAINTED A SUCCESSFUL AND ACCEPTABLE PICTURE OF CATTLE DROWSING PICTURESQUELY UNDER WALNUT TREES AND AS HE HAD BEGUN SO OF NECESSITY HE WENT ON HIS
COLONEL CHUTTLE KNOWS THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE STILTON WITHOUT HAVING TO BE TOLD SO AND THE FROPLINSONS KNOW THAT WE ARE BORED WITH THEIR CALENDAR WHATEVER WE MAY SAY TO THE CONTRARY JUST AS WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE BORED WITH THE BRIDGE MARKERS IN SPITE OF THEIR WRITTEN ASSURANCE THAT THEY THANKED US FOR OUR CHARMING LITTLE GIFT
SEEMS TO HAVE ESCAPED FROM MY MEMORY NOW ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS THAT YOU WERE A NEAR NEIGHBOUR AND A CATTLE PAINTER PRESUMABLY MORE OR LESS FAMILIAR WITH THE SUBJECTS THAT YOU PAINTED
OR COMMUNICATION THAT DOES NOT DEAL WITH THE NECESSARY EVENTS OF THE MOMENT ANSWERS TO INVITATIONS ARRANGEMENTS ABOUT TRAINS RENEWAL OF CLUB SUBSCRIPTIONS AND OF COURSE ALL THE ORDINARY EVERYDAY AFFAIRS OF BUSINESS SICKNESS
A GRIN SPREAD OVER HIS GOOD NATURED FEATURES IT DONT LOOK LIKE IT HE SAID NODDING TOWARDS THE YARD EMMA TURNED TO CATCH THE MEANING OF HIS REMARK OLD MARTHA STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF A MOB OF POULTRY
CLATTERED DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND FORTHWITH COMMENCED A SPIRITED COMBAT WITH HIS REFLECTION IN THE WARDROBE MIRROR REMEMBERING THAT THE BIRD WAS MORE OR LESS UNDER HIS CARE LATIMER PERFORMED HAGUE TRIBUNAL OFFICES BY DRAPING A BATH TOWEL OVER THE PROVOCATIVE MIRROR BUT
WALNUT TREES AND DUN COWS HIS TWO ATTEMPTS TO BREAK AWAY FROM HIS OWN TRADITION WERE SIGNAL FAILURES TURTLE DOVES ALARMED BY SPARROW HAWK AND WOLVES ON THE ROMAN CAMPAGNA CAME BACK TO HIS STUDIO
HELL PROBABLY ROOST ON THE RAIL AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BED
SHE COULD SEE AN ANGLE OF THE LONG LATTICED WINDOW THAT WAS TO HAVE BEEN COSY WITH CURTAINS AND GAY WITH BOWLS OF FLOWERS INTO HER MIND CAME THE THOUGHT THAT FOR MONTHS PERHAPS FOR YEARS LONG AFTER SHE HAD BEEN UTTERLY FORGOTTEN
AND YET FOR ALL THAT IT STOOD SO WELL IN THE CENTRE OF HUMAN BUSTLE ITS LONG LATTICED WINDOW WITH THE WIDE WINDOW SEAT BUILT INTO AN EMBRASURE BEYOND THE HUGE FIREPLACE LOOKED OUT ON A WILD SPREADING VIEW OF HILL AND HEATHER AND WOODED COMBE
NURNBERG SEVILLE AND SALONICA BECAME MORE FAVOURED AS PLANTING OUT GROUNDS FOR THE PERSONNEL OF NOT ONLY WEEKLY BUT DAILY PAPERS AS WELL THE LOCALITIES WERE PERHAPS NOT ALWAYS WELL CHOSEN
SOUNDS DELIGHTFULLY SIMPLE SAID JANETTA WISTFULLY BUT PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER IT TOO CUT AND DRIED TOO PERFUNCTORY IT IS NOT A BIT MORE PERFUNCTORY THAN THE PRESENT SYSTEM SAID EGBERT
SHE ADDED IN ICY CALM AS A GLOWING ORANGE HEAD WAS CRUSHED INTO THE HUGE MUNCHING MOUTH SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN SO FRANK ABOUT THE VARIETY OF THE CHRYSANTHEMUM SAID ESHLEY
AT THE DOOR LEADING TO THE EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT THE WAY WAS BARRED BY A NERVOUS BUT DEFIANT OFFICE BOY YOU CANT SEE THE EDITOR NOR ANY OF THE STAFF HE ANNOUNCED
AS THE CHIEF OF A KURDISH NOMAD CLAN WOULD TO A JAPANESE TEA SHOP GIRL ESHLEY STOOD VERY NEAR THE GATE WHILE HE STUDIED THE ANIMALS APPEARANCE AND DEMEANOUR ADELA PINGSFORD CONTINUED TO SAY NOTHING
THE FARM SHE SOON FOUND OUT HAD THAT FACULTY COMMON TO FARMYARDS OF SWALLOWING UP AND LOSING ITS HUMAN POPULATION THE POULTRY FOLLOWED HER IN INTERESTED FASHION AND SWINE GRUNTED INTERROGATIONS AT HER FROM BEHIND THE BARS OF THEIR STYES
SCATTERING HANDFULS OF GRAIN AROUND HER THE TURKEY COCK WITH THE BRONZED SHEEN OF HIS FEATHERS AND THE PURPLE RED OF HIS WATTLES THE GAMECOCK WITH THE GLOWING METALLIC LUSTRE OF HIS EASTERN PLUMAGE THE HENS WITH THEIR OCHRES AND BUFFS AND UMBERS
RESUMED ITS MASSAGE OPERATIONS WITH RENEWED ZEAL DURING THE LONG WAKEFUL HOURS WHICH ENSUED LATIMER TRIED TO DISTRACT HIS MIND FROM HIS OWN IMMEDIATE TROUBLES BY DWELLING WITH DECENT SYMPATHY ON THE SECOND HOUSEMAIDS BEREAVEMENT
WITH AN ARTISTIC HUMPING OF THE BACK AT THE CRUCIAL MOMENT AND AN ACCOMPANYING GURGLE OF LONG DRAWN DELIGHT THE GAMECOCK WHO MAY HAVE FANCIED THAT HE WAS BEING ROCKED IN THE BRANCHES OF A PINE TREE BORE THE MOTION
GOOD GRACIOUS HAVE ANY LIVES BEEN LOST HEAPS I SHOULD SAY
THE OX HAD FINISHED THE VASE FLOWERS AND THE COVER OF ISRAEL KALISCH AND APPEARED TO BE THINKING OF LEAVING ITS RATHER RESTRICTED QUARTERS ESHLEY NOTICED ITS RESTLESSNESS AND PROMPTLY FLUNG IT SOME BUNCHES OF VIRGINIA CREEPER LEAVES
LATIMER HAD SCARCELY SHUT HIS BEDROOM DOOR BEFORE HE WAS IMMERSED IN A SHEAF OF NOTES AND PAMPHLETS
THE FORLORN SILENCE OF THOSE WHO ARE BEREFT OF HOPE AND HAVE ALMOST CEASED TO CARE PRESENTLY EGBERT STARTED FROM HIS SEAT WITH AN AIR OF RESOLUTION THE LIGHT OF BATTLE WAS IN HIS EYES LET ME COME TO THE WRITING TABLE HE EXCLAIMED GLADLY SAID JANETTA
I HAVE ONLY THE SAME CONVENTIONAL LANGUAGE OF GRATITUDE AT MY DISPOSAL WITH WHICH TO THANK DEAR OLD COLONEL CHUTTLE FOR HIS PERFECTLY DELICIOUS STILTON WHICH WE SHALL DEVOUR TO THE LAST MORSEL AND THE FROPLINSONS FOR THEIR CALENDAR WHICH WE SHALL NEVER LOOK AT
A CATTLE PAINTER BY FORCE OF ENVIRONMENT
WE INSIST ON SEEING THE EDITOR OR SOME RESPONSIBLE PERSON SAID THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE DEPUTATION FORCED ITS WAY IN THE BOY HAD SPOKEN TRULY THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN IN THE WHOLE SUITE OF ROOMS
ITS WHAT I ALWAYS DO SAY AND WHAT EVERY ONE SAYS TO ME PROTESTED EGBERT WE SENT THEM SOMETHING ON THE TWENTY SECOND SAID JANETTA SO THEY SIMPLY HAD TO THINK OF US THERE WAS NO GETTING AWAY FROM IT
IN THE TEETH OF THE SPIRITED BIDDING OF THREE MEAT EXTRACT FIRMS FROM THAT MOMENT HIS SUCCESS WAS CONTINUOUS AND ASSURED AND THE ROYAL ACADEMY WAS THANKFUL TWO YEARS LATER TO GIVE A CONSPICUOUS POSITION ON ITS WALLS TO HIS LARGE CANVAS
NOT SUCH A GOOD FLAVOUR AS THE ONE YOU SENT LAST YEAR WHICH ITSELF WAS NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE HAMS ARE NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE IT WOULD BE A PITY TO BE DEPRIVED OF HER CHRISTMAS COMMENTS BUT THAT LOSS WOULD BE SWALLOWED UP IN THE GENERAL GAIN MEANWHILE SAID JANETTA
NOONTIDE PEACE A STUDY OF TWO DUN COWS UNDER A WALNUT TREE WAS FOLLOWED BY A MID DAY SANCTUARY A STUDY OF A WALNUT TREE WITH TWO DUN COWS UNDER IT
WELL IT WAS WILLIAM WORDSWORTH THEN SAID JANETTA I KNOW WILLIAM CAME INTO IT SOMEWHERE THAT SOUNDS MORE PROBABLE SAID EGBERT WELL LETS COLLABORATE ON THIS LETTER OF THANKS AND GET IT DONE
BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO ANSWER A MUCH ENCUMBERED VERA BURST INTO THE ROOM WITH THE QUESTION I SAY CAN I LEAVE THESE HERE THESE WERE A SMALL BLACK PIG AND A LUSTY SPECIMEN OF BLACK RED GAMECOCK
POSSIBLY I WAS MISTAKEN I
ON WHOSE FRONT PAGE WAS THE RECORD IN FADED INK OF A BAPTISM DATED NINETY FOUR YEARS AGO MARTHA CRALE WAS THE NAME WRITTEN ON THAT YELLOW PAGE THE YELLOW WRINKLED OLD DAME WHO HOBBLED AND MUTTERED ABOUT THE KITCHEN
WITH A QUOTATION OF ONE OF HIS GREAT THOUGHTS FOR EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR IMPOSSIBLE SAID EGBERT HE DIDNT HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUGHTS IN THE WHOLE OF HIS LIFE OR IF HE DID HE KEPT THEM TO HIMSELF HE WAS A MAN OF ACTION NOT OF INTROSPECTION
AND ANYHOW YOU CANT SUDDENLY DISMISS THE SUBJECT OF THE CALENDAR SURELY THERE MUST BE SOME INTELLIGENT REMARK THAT CAN BE MADE ABOUT IT WELL WE CANT THINK OF ONE SAID JANETTA WEARILY THE FACT IS WEVE BOTH WRITTEN OURSELVES OUT
WITH HER BOXES ALREADY STOWED IN THE FARM CART TILL THE LAST OF THE MARKET PRODUCE SHOULD BE READY FOR THE TRAIN SHE WAS TO CATCH WAS OF LESS IMPORTANCE THAN THE CHICKENS AND BUTTER AND EGGS THAT WERE TO BE OFFERED FOR SALE FROM WHERE SHE STOOD
SHE HAD SEEN IT ON THE FLOOR TOO WITH A ROTTEN APPLE SQUASHED OVER IT FOR THE FARM HAD CHANGED ITS POLITICS FROM TIME TO TIME MARTHA HAD NEVER BEEN ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER NONE OF THEY HAD EVER DONE THE FARM A STROKE OF GOOD
EPISTOLARY TRUCE OF GOD DURING THE FESTIVITIES OF CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR FROM THE TWENTY FOURTH OF DECEMBER TO THE THIRD OR FOURTH OF JANUARY IT SHALL BE CONSIDERED AN OFFENCE AGAINST GOOD SENSE AND GOOD FEELING TO WRITE OR EXPECT ANY LETTER
EMMA WITH THE LATEST SCIENCE OF DEAD POULTRY DRESSING AT HER FINGER TIPS SAT BY AN UNHEEDED WATCHER WHILE OLD MARTHA TRUSSED THE CHICKENS FOR THE MARKET STALL AS SHE HAD TRUSSED THEM FOR NEARLY FOURSCORE YEARSALL
BUT IVE COME TO THE END OF MY CAPACITY FOR EXPRESSING SERVILE AMIABILITY ELEVEN LETTERS TO DAY AND NINE YESTERDAY ALL COUCHED IN THE SAME STRAIN OF ECSTATIC THANKFULNESS REALLY YOU CANT EXPECT ME TO SIT DOWN TO ANOTHER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS WRITING ONESELF OUT
OF COURSE I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID EGBERT EVERY PRESENT THAT WAS SENT OFF WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A TICKET BEARING THE DATE OF DISPATCH AND THE SIGNATURE OF THE SENDER
THERE WAS AN UNSPOKEN WISH IN THOSE WORDS A WISH WHICH WAS UNCONFESSED AS WELL AS UNSPOKEN EMMA LADBRUK WAS THE MISTRESS OF THE FARM JOINTLY WITH HER HUSBAND SHE MIGHT HAVE HER SAY AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HER WAY IN ORDERING ITS AFFAIRS
I DONT DISPUTE THE NECESSITY BUT I DONT THINK THE SOME ONE SHOULD BE ME SAID JANETTA I WOULDNT MIND WRITING A LETTER OF ANGRY RECRIMINATION OR HEARTLESS SATIRE TO SOME SUITABLE RECIPIENT IN FACT I SHOULD RATHER ENJOY IT
AND FOUND AN UNACCUSTOMED STATE OF THINGS IN THAT USUALLY BUSY QUARTER OLD MARTHA WAS NOT WORKING A BASKET OF CORN WAS ON THE FLOOR BY HER SIDE AND OUT IN THE YARD THE POULTRY WERE BEGINNING TO CLAMOUR A PROTEST OF OVERDUE FEEDING TIME
AND EMERALD GREEN OR ORANGE WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD WITH THIS HOME RULE BUSINESS TO THE FORE ON STATE OCCASIONS I ALWAYS WEAR A BLACK RIBBON IN MY HAIR SAID VERA WITH CRUSHING DIGNITY
THE HENS ARE ALL IN THE PANTRY AND I THINK I COULD PICK OUT HARTLEPOOL HELEN SHES HIS FAVOURITE LATIMER SHOWED A BELATED FIRMNESS ON THE SUBJECT OF HARTLEPOOL HELEN AND VERA WITHDREW WITHOUT PRESSING THE POINT
SHOO VARIETY IF THE OX HEARD THEM IT GAVE NO OUTWARD INDICATION OF THE FACT
EDITOR SUB EDITORS LEADER WRITERS PRINCIPAL REPORTERS AND SO FORTH ALL TOOK PART IN WHAT WAS POPULARLY ALLUDED TO AS THE DRANG NACH OSTEN
BUT BARNYARD AND RICKYARD ORCHARD AND STABLES AND DAIRY GAVE NO REWARD TO HER SEARCH THEN AS SHE RETRACED HER STEPS TOWARDS THE KITCHEN SHE CAME SUDDENLY ON HER COUSIN YOUNG MISTER JIM AS EVERY ONE CALLED HIM
MILKING STOOL AND BRANDING IRON HIS HOME WAS IN A PARK LIKE VILLA DOTTED DISTRICT THAT ONLY JUST ESCAPED THE REPROACH OF BEING SUBURBAN ON ONE SIDE OF HIS GARDEN THERE ABUTTED A SMALL PICTURESQUE MEADOW
AND ALL THE BUSY PLACES OF THE FARM SEEMED TO LEAD BY EASY ACCESS INTO ITS WIDE FLAGGED HAVEN WHERE THERE WAS ROOM FOR EVERYTHING AND WHERE MUDDY BOOTS LEFT TRACES THAT WERE EASILY SWEPT AWAY
LISBON OR INNSBRUCK IF YOU CHANCED TO SEE THE PRINCIPAL LEADER WRITER OR THE ART EDITOR LUNCHING AS USUAL AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED RESTAURANTS THE DAILY INTELLIGENCER WAS DETERMINED TO GIVE NO LOOPHOLE
THE LETTER HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO THE OFFICE BOY IN CHARGE WHO HAD QUIETLY SUPPRESSED IT NO ONE IS A HERO TO ONES OWN OFFICE BOY AND HE EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED THAT A QUARTER OF A MILLION WAS AN UNWARRANTABLE OUTLAY FOR SUCH
WITH GREATER FORTITUDE THAN LATIMER WAS ABLE TO COMMAND A SERIES OF SLAPS DIRECTED AT THE PIGS BODY WERE ACCEPTED MORE AS AN ADDITIONAL AND PLEASING IRRITANT THAN AS A CRITICISM OF CONDUCT OR A HINT TO DESIST
IVE WRITTEN NEARLY AS MANY SAID EGBERT AND IVE HAD MY USUAL BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE TO GET THROUGH TOO BESIDES I DONT KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT THE FROPLINSONS SENT US A WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR CALENDAR SAID JANETTA
BOVRIL ADVERTISEMENT THE IMMEDIATELY IMPORTANT QUESTION IS NOT HOW IT GOT IN BUT HOW TO GET IT OUT WONT IT GO SAID ESHLEY IF IT WAS ANXIOUS TO GO SAID ADELA PINGSFORD RATHER ANGRILY
IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT MUCH COULD BE DONE FOR HER BUT EMMA HASTENED AWAY TO GET ASSISTANCE AND COUNSEL HER HUSBAND SHE KNEW WAS DOWN AT A TREE FELLING SOME LITTLE DISTANCE OFF BUT SHE MIGHT FIND SOME OTHER INTELLIGENT SOUL WHO KNEW THE OLD WOMAN BETTER THAN SHE DID
AND WHETHER IT WAS THE STUPID COLT OR THE LOUD CRACKING OF THE WHIP
HE CALLED ME OLD CRONY AS I USED TO COME TO HIM IN THE FIELD AND FOLLOW HIM ABOUT SOMETIMES HE BROUGHT HIS GRANDFATHER WHO ALWAYS LOOKED CLOSELY AT MY LEGS THIS IS OUR POINT WILLIE
THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF RAIN AND NOW THE WIND WAS VERY HIGH AND BLEW THE DRY LEAVES ACROSS THE ROAD IN A SHOWER WE WENT ALONG MERRILY TILL WE CAME TO THE TOLL BAR AND THE LOW WOODEN BRIDGE
OMNIBUSES CARTS VANS TRUCKS CABS AND GREAT WAGONS CREEPING ALONG AT A WALKING PACE SOME GOING ONE WAY SOME ANOTHER SOME GOING SLOWLY OTHERS WANTING TO PASS THEM OMNIBUSES STOPPING SHORT EVERY FEW MINUTES TO TAKE UP A PASSENGER
THE FARRIER ORDERED ALL THE LITTER TO BE TAKEN OUT OF MY BOX DAY BY DAY AND THE FLOOR KEPT VERY CLEAN THEN I WAS TO HAVE BRAN MASHES A LITTLE GREEN FOOD AND NOT SO MUCH CORN
OF COURSE I COULD NOT TELL HIM BUT I KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE BRIDGE WAS NOT SAFE
CAN YOUR HORSE DO IT OR CAN'T HE SAID THE BLUSTERING MAN
I TROTTED QUIETLY ALONG THE WHEELS HARDLY MAKING A SOUND ON THE SOFT ROAD FOR A GOOD WHILE NEITHER MASTER NOR JOHN SPOKE AND THEN MASTER BEGAN IN A SERIOUS VOICE
AND WHEN AT LAST IT WAS HEALED THEY PUT A BLISTERING FLUID OVER THE FRONT OF BOTH KNEES TO BRING ALL THE HAIR OFF THEY HAD SOME REASON FOR THIS AND I SUPPOSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AS SMITH'S DEATH HAD BEEN SO SUDDEN
I WAS STRUGGLING TO KEEP ON GOADED BY CONSTANT CHUCKS OF THE REIN AND USE OF THE WHIP WHEN IN A SINGLE MOMENT I CANNOT TELL HOW
SCARCELY DRAWING THE REIN BLANTYRE SHOUTED WHICH WAY TO THE RIGHT CRIED THE WOMAN POINTING WITH HER HAND AND AWAY WE WENT UP THE RIGHT HAND ROAD THEN FOR A MOMENT WE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER
A PRETTY THING IT WOULD BE IF A MAN OF BUSINESS HAD TO EXAMINE EVERY CAB HORSE BEFORE HE HIRED IT THE MAN KNOWS HIS OWN BUSINESS OF COURSE THERE GET IN AND HOLD YOUR TONGUE MY GENTLE FRIEND HAD TO OBEY
BUT I SHOULD SAY THAT FEELING IS BELIEVING
AND HE WOULD EVEN WHIP ME UNDER THE BELLY AND FLIP THE LASH OUT AT MY HEAD INDIGNITIES LIKE THESE TOOK THE HEART OUT OF ME TERRIBLY BUT STILL I DID MY BEST
AND THANK YOU MA'AM BUT IF HE WENT WITHOUT A CHECK REIN I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF ALL THE CARTERS IT IS THE FASHION YOU SEE IS IT NOT BETTER SHE SAID
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG SIR SAID JOHN AND HE SPRANG OUT OF THE DOG CART AND CAME TO MY HEAD AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HE TRIED TO LEAD ME FORWARD COME ON BEAUTY WHAT'S THE MATTER
THE LADY ANNE OR A RUNAWAY HORSE EARLY IN THE SPRING LORD W AND PART OF HIS FAMILY WENT UP TO LONDON AND TOOK YORK WITH THEM
THERE WAS ONE MAN I THOUGHT IF HE WOULD BUY ME I SHOULD BE HAPPY HE WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN NOR YET ONE OF THE LOUD FLASHY SORT THAT CALL THEMSELVES SO HE WAS RATHER A SMALL MAN BUT WELL MADE
OH GRANDPAPA
SAID SHE PATTING AND STROKING ME WITH HER GENTLE HAND AND NOW IF YOU WILL SPEAK KINDLY TO HIM AND LEAD HIM ON I BELIEVE HE WILL BE ABLE TO DO BETTER JAKES TOOK THE REIN COME ON BLACKIE
AND BE QUICK AS A RAT DOG TO SEE IF THERE BE ROOM AND IF THERE BE TIME LEST YOU GET YOUR OWN WHEELS LOCKED OR SMASHED OR THE SHAFT OF SOME OTHER VEHICLE RUN INTO YOUR CHEST OR SHOULDER ALL THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR
AT THE KNACKER'S OR ELSEWHERE
HE THEN SOMEHOW SCRAMBLED INTO THE SADDLE AND WITH A GEE UP AND A CLAP ON MY SIDES WITH BOTH HIS LEGS HE STARTED ON HIS JOURNEY MAKING A LITTLE CIRCUIT TO AVOID THE DIKE HE HAD NO WHIP WHICH SEEMED TO TROUBLE HIM
THEY WERE ALWAYS EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR JERRY WOULD SAY IF YOU IN THE MORNING THROW MINUTES AWAY YOU CAN'T PICK THEM UP IN THE COURSE OF A DAY YOU MAY HURRY AND SCURRY AND FLURRY AND WORRY YOU'VE LOST THEM FOREVER FOREVER AND AYE
AND IN A MOMENT I PUT MY HEAD DOWN TO MY VERY KNEES WHAT A COMFORT IT WAS THEN I TOSSED IT UP AND DOWN SEVERAL TIMES TO GET THE ACHING STIFFNESS OUT OF MY NECK
HE WAS RAISING THE WHIP AGAIN WHEN THE LADY SAID
I HAVE NO MEADOWS TO NURSE SICK HORSES IN HE MIGHT GET WELL OR HE MIGHT NOT THAT SORT OF THING DON'T SUIT MY BUSINESS MY PLAN IS TO WORK EM AS LONG AS THEY'LL GO AND THEN SELL EM FOR WHAT THEY'LL FETCH
AT ONCE THE LITTLE HAND WAS PATTING ABOUT ALL OVER MY SHOULDER WITHOUT FEAR HOW GOOD IT FELT LET ME GET HIM A BRAN MASH WHILE YOU RUB HIM DOWN SAID THE MOTHER DO POLLY IT'S JUST WHAT HE WANTS
I FOUND BY THEIR CONVERSATION THAT MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS NOW OUT OF DANGER AND WOULD SOON BE ABLE TO RIDE AGAIN
TILL MY FEET WERE WELL AGAIN WITH THIS TREATMENT I SOON REGAINED MY SPIRITS BUT MISTER BARRY WAS SO MUCH DISGUSTED AT BEING TWICE DECEIVED BY HIS GROOMS THAT HE DETERMINED TO GIVE UP KEEPING A HORSE
THE RIVER BANKS WERE RATHER HIGH AND THE BRIDGE INSTEAD OF RISING WENT ACROSS JUST LEVEL SO THAT IN THE MIDDLE IF THE RIVER WAS FULL THE WATER WOULD BE NEARLY UP TO THE WOODWORK AND PLANKS
SOON BEGAN TO TELL ON MY CONDITION AND MY SPIRITS I HAD A GOOD CONSTITUTION FROM MY MOTHER AND I WAS NEVER STRAINED WHEN I WAS YOUNG SO THAT I HAD A BETTER CHANCE THAN MANY HORSES WHO HAVE BEEN WORKED BEFORE THEY CAME TO THEIR FULL STRENGTH
I PUT DOWN MY HEAD AND THREW MY WHOLE WEIGHT AGAINST THE COLLAR I SPARED NO STRENGTH THE LOAD MOVED ON AND I PULLED IT STEADILY UP THE HILL AND THEN STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
AND WAS IN A MOMENT AT MY HEAD THAT WAS A VERY NEAR TOUCH SAID MY MASTER WHAT'S TO BE DONE NOW WELL SIR WE CAN'T DRIVE OVER THAT TREE NOR YET GET ROUND IT
I MADE TWO SUCH SERIOUS STUMBLES THAT AS HE CAME DOWN LANSDOWN INTO THE CITY HE STOPPED AT THE FARRIER'S AND ASKED HIM TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH ME
LONG STRINGS OF YOUNG HORSES OUT OF THE COUNTRY FRESH FROM THE MARSHES AND DROVES OF SHAGGY LITTLE WELSH PONIES NO HIGHER THAN MERRYLEGS AND HUNDREDS OF CART HORSES OF ALL SORTS
AND TWOULD BE WORTH A GENTLEMAN'S WHILE TO GIVE A FIVE POUND NOTE FOR HIM AND LET HIM HAVE A CHANCE I'LL BE BOUND HE'D BE WORTH TWENTY POUNDS NEXT SPRING THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED AND THE LITTLE BOY LOOKED UP EAGERLY
HIS FEET ARE VERY TENDER IT IS FORTUNATE THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN DOWN I WONDER YOUR GROOM HAS NOT SEEN TO IT BEFORE THIS IS THE SORT OF THING WE FIND IN FOUL STABLES WHERE THE LITTER IS NEVER PROPERLY CLEANED OUT IF YOU WILL SEND HIM HERE TO MORROW
DO SO I AM NOW GOING THERE THEY WALKED FORWARD AND I WAS LED BEHIND THE BOY COULD HARDLY CONTROL HIS DELIGHT AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEEMED TO ENJOY HIS PLEASURE I HAD A GOOD FEED AT THE INN
HIS SHOVEL DROPPED AND HIS HANDS RAISED AS WE CAME NEAR HE MADE A SIGN TO SPEAK
HE ALWAYS BRUSHED MY MANE AND TAIL WITH WATER AND MY HOOFS WITH OIL BEFORE HE BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR TO MAKE ME LOOK SMART
WITH GREAT PAIN I AM SURE HE WAS SORRY FOR ME FOR HE OFTEN PATTED AND ENCOURAGED ME TALKING TO ME IN A PLEASANT VOICE AT LAST I REACHED MY OWN BOX AND HAD SOME CORN
AND SOME WITH OLD SORES ON THEIR BACKS AND HIPS THESE WERE SAD SIGHTS FOR A HORSE TO LOOK UPON WHO KNOWS NOT BUT HE MAY COME TO THE SAME STATE THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF BARGAINING OF RUNNING UP AND BEATING DOWN
AND GIVING ME A BIT OF CARROT OR SOMETHING GOOD OR SOMETIMES STANDING BY ME WHILE I ATE MY OATS HE ALWAYS CAME WITH KIND WORDS AND CARESSES AND OF COURSE I GREW VERY FOND OF HIM
BUT FOR ALL THAT SHE BEGGED ME TO GO AND MEET HIM BUT WHAT MUST WE DO THERE'S THE HORSE TO GET HOME AS WELL AS THE BODY AND THAT WILL BE NO EASY MATTER
AND STOOPED DOWN OVER IT IT IS REUBEN HE SAID AND HE DOES NOT STIR THE OTHER MAN FOLLOWED AND BENT OVER HIM HE'S DEAD HE SAID
AGAIN AND AGAIN I NEIGHED PAWING THE GROUND IMPATIENTLY AND TOSSING MY HEAD TO GET THE REIN LOOSE I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BLANTYRE CAME RUNNING TO THE GATE HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY ABOUT
GOOD LUCK IS RATHER PARTICULAR WHO SHE RIDES WITH AND MOSTLY PREFERS THOSE WHO HAVE GOT COMMON SENSE AND A GOOD HEART AT LEAST THAT IS MY EXPERIENCE GOVERNOR GRAY TURNED ROUND AGAIN TO HIS NEWSPAPER
I AM SURE HE MAKES FRIENDS OF THEM IF EVER A MAN DID AT LAST WE CAME TO THE PARK GATES AND FOUND THE GARDENER LOOKING OUT FOR US HE SAID THAT MISTRESS HAD BEEN IN A DREADFUL WAY EVER SINCE DARK
FOR HE WAS ALTOGETHER AS IGNORANT AS HE WAS CONCEITED AND THEN INSTEAD OF EXERCISE OR CHANGE OF FOOD I HAD TO TAKE HORSE BALLS AND DRAUGHTS WHICH BESIDE THE NUISANCE OF HAVING THEM POURED DOWN MY THROAT
AND WAS SOON HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES LIZZIE WAS STANDING QUIETLY BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A FEW PACES OFF WITH HER BACK TO ME MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS SITTING EASILY WITH A LOOSE REIN
I'M AFRAID IT HAS BEEN THE OLD THING OVER AGAIN POOR SUSAN SHE LOOKED AWFULLY PALE WHEN SHE CAME TO MY HOUSE TO ASK IF HE HAD NOT COME HOME SHE MADE BELIEVE SHE WAS NOT A BIT ANXIOUS
AT LAST IN PASSING THROUGH ONE WE CAME TO A LONG CAB STAND WHEN MY RIDER CALLED OUT IN A CHEERY VOICE GOOD NIGHT GOVERNOR HALLOO CRIED A VOICE HAVE YOU GOT A GOOD ONE I THINK SO REPLIED MY OWNER
HAD LEFT THEIR WORK TO CATCH HER BLANTYRE'S HALLOO SOON BROUGHT THEM TO THE SPOT THE FOREMOST MAN SEEMED MUCH TROUBLED AT THE SIGHT AND ASKED WHAT HE COULD DO CAN YOU RIDE
THAT A YOUNGER HORSE WAS BOUGHT IN MY PLACE I MAY AS WELL MENTION HERE WHAT I SUFFERED AT THIS TIME FROM ANOTHER CAUSE I HAD HEARD HORSES SPEAK OF IT BUT HAD NEVER MYSELF HAD EXPERIENCE OF THE EVIL
AND THE ROAD IS VERY STEEP I AM SURE HE IS DOING HIS BEST IF DOING HIS BEST WON'T GET THIS LOAD UP HE MUST DO SOMETHING MORE THAN HIS BEST THAT'S ALL I KNOW MA'AM SAID JAKES
THAT I COULD HARDLY TOUCH MY FOOD HOW I USED TO LONG FOR THE NICE BRAN MASH WITH NITER IN IT THAT JERRY USED TO GIVE US ON SATURDAY NIGHTS IN HOT WEATHER
AND HE WORE A BROAD BRIMMED HAT WHEN HE CAME UP TO ME AND MY COMPANIONS HE STOOD STILL AND GAVE A PITIFUL LOOK ROUND UPON US I SAW HIS EYE REST ON ME
AND AFTER ROBERT HAD WRAPPED UP MY KNEES IN WET CLOTHS HE TIED UP MY FOOT IN A BRAN POULTICE TO DRAW OUT THE HEAT AND CLEANSE IT BEFORE THE HORSE DOCTOR SAW IT IN THE MORNING AND I MANAGED TO GET MYSELF DOWN ON THE STRAW
I WILL NEVER SAY I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED FOR I WAS I STOPPED STILL AND I BELIEVE I TREMBLED OF COURSE I DID NOT TURN ROUND OR RUN AWAY I WAS NOT BROUGHT UP TO THAT JOHN JUMPED OUT
THEN FEEL ALL THE WAY DOWN MY LEGS AND GIVE ME A HARD FEEL OF THE SKIN AND FLESH AND THEN TRY MY PACES IT WAS WONDERFUL WHAT A DIFFERENCE THERE WAS IN THE WAY THESE THINGS WERE DONE SOME DID IT IN A ROUGH OFFHAND WAY AS IF
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I SHALL BE THE LESS HAPPY FOR THAT I HAVE HEARD THE COMMANDMENTS READ A GREAT MANY TIMES AND I NEVER NOTICED THAT ANY OF THEM SAID THOU SHALT BE RICH AND THERE ARE A GOOD MANY CURIOUS THINGS SAID IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ABOUT RICH MEN
AND TO HIRE WHEN HE WANTED ONE I WAS THEREFORE KEPT TILL MY FEET WERE QUITE SOUND
AND SO I THOUGHT AS WE WENT ALONG THE SKIRTS OF A WOOD WHERE THE GREAT BRANCHES WERE SWAYING ABOUT LIKE TWIGS AND THE RUSHING SOUND WAS TERRIBLE I WISH WE WERE WELL OUT OF THIS WOOD SAID MY MASTER
WOULD THEY ASK THIS QUESTION FOR HER AT DOCTOR ASHLEY'S AND BRING THE ANSWER THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT A MILE OFF AND THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE WAS THE LAST IN IT WE WENT ALONG GAYLY ENOUGH
NO NO HE SAID I'LL BE BACK TO EM AGAIN BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE FIELDS
WE CALL THEM DUMB ANIMALS AND SO THEY ARE FOR THEY CANNOT TELL US HOW THEY FEEL BUT THEY DO NOT SUFFER LESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO WORDS BUT I MUST NOT DETAIN YOU NOW
HE SET OFF AS HARD AS HE COULD JERRY PATTED ME ON THE NECK NO JACK A SHILLING WOULD NOT PAY FOR THAT SORT OF THING WOULD IT OLD BOY ALTHOUGH JERRY WAS DETERMINEDLY SET AGAINST HARD DRIVING
SAID THE FARMER AS I CAME BACK FIVE POUNDS SIR THAT WAS THE LOWEST PRICE MY MASTER SET TIS A SPECULATION SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN SHAKING HIS HEAD
WE'LL SHOW THEM HOW WE CAN GET OVER THE GROUND IF WE ONLY KNOW WHY IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO DRIVE FAST IN THE CITY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN THE STREETS ARE FULL OF TRAFFIC BUT WE DID WHAT COULD BE DONE AND WHEN A GOOD DRIVER
THE YOUNG MAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT AND SAID ANXIOUSLY I THINK I HAD BETTER GET OUT AND WALK I SHALL NEVER GET THERE IF THIS GOES ON I'LL DO ALL THAT CAN BE DONE SIR SAID JERRY I THINK WE SHALL BE IN TIME
AND BOX AFTER BOX WAS DRAGGED UP AND LODGED ON THE TOP OF THE CAB OR SETTLED BY THE SIDE OF THE DRIVER AT LAST ALL WAS READY AND WITH HIS USUAL JERK AT THE REIN AND SLASH OF THE WHIP
THROUGH SOME ACCIDENT OR BLEMISH UNSOUNDNESS OF WIND OR SOME OTHER COMPLAINT THERE WERE SOME SPLENDID ANIMALS QUITE IN THEIR PRIME AND FIT FOR ANYTHING THEY WERE THROWING OUT THEIR LEGS AND SHOWING OFF THEIR PACES IN HIGH STYLE
THE MAN LAUGHED YOU SEE SHE SAID YOU DO NOT GIVE HIM A FAIR CHANCE HE CANNOT USE ALL HIS POWER WITH HIS HEAD HELD BACK AS IT IS WITH THAT CHECK REIN
PERHAPS YOU COME TO A REGULAR BLOCK UP AND HAVE TO STAND STILL FOR MINUTES TOGETHER TILL SOMETHING CLEARS OUT INTO A SIDE STREET OR THE POLICEMAN INTERFERES YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR ANY CHANCE TO DASH FORWARD IF THERE BE AN OPENING
TO LEAD A GOOD FASHION THAN TO FOLLOW A BAD ONE A GREAT MANY GENTLEMEN DO NOT USE CHECK REINS NOW OUR CARRIAGE HORSES HAVE NOT WORN THEM FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
SHE WAS UNCOMMON GOOD TO MY WIFE IN THE WINTER THEN MOUNT THIS HORSE MY FRIEND YOUR NECK WILL BE QUITE SAFE AND RIDE TO THE DOCTOR'S AND ASK HIM TO COME INSTANTLY
AND A GOOD MANY LIKE MYSELF HANDSOME AND HIGH BRED
HERE I WAS PUT INTO A WELL LITTERED STALL AND SOME WARM GRUEL WAS BROUGHT TO ME WHICH I DRANK THANKFULLY IN THE EVENING
WELL SIR HE SAID TOUCHING HIS CAP I'LL DO SO IF YOU PLEASE SIR BUT IT IS RATHER DANGEROUS SIR THROWING DOWN WATER IN A HORSE'S BOX THEY ARE VERY APT TO TAKE COLD SIR I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO HIM AN INJURY
BUT AS THE MASTER'S BUSINESS ENGAGED HIM A LONG TIME WE DID NOT START FOR HOME TILL RATHER LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THE WIND WAS THEN MUCH HIGHER AND I HEARD THE MASTER SAY TO JOHN THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN OUT IN SUCH A STORM
MAY OPEN HER EYES SOON THEN SEEING THE OTHER MAN HE CALLED OUT HERE JOE RUN FOR SOME WATER AND TELL MY MISSIS
SOME ONE CAME AND LOOSENED THE THROAT STRAP OF MY BRIDLE AND UNDID THE TRACES WHICH KEPT THE COLLAR SO TIGHT UPON ME SOME ONE SAID HE'S DEAD HE'LL NEVER GET UP AGAIN THEN
THE LADY HAD WALKED ALONG THE FOOTPATH AND NOW CAME ACROSS INTO THE ROAD SHE STROKED AND PATTED MY NECK AS I HAD NOT BEEN PATTED FOR MANY A LONG DAY YOU SEE HE
TALKING TO HIMSELF AND TALKING TO ME HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO LONDON THROUGH PLEASANT LANES AND COUNTRY ROADS UNTIL WE CAME INTO THE GREAT LONDON THOROUGHFARE ON WHICH WE TRAVELED STEADILY
HE COULD NOT BEAR ANY CARELESS LOITERING AND WASTE OF TIME AND NOTHING WAS SO NEAR MAKING HIM ANGRY AS TO FIND PEOPLE WHO WERE ALWAYS LATE WANTING A CAB HORSE TO BE DRIVEN HARD TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR IDLENESS
BUT I'LL DO IT IF YOU PLEASE SIR WELL SAID HIS MASTER I SHOULD NOT LIKE HIM TO TAKE COLD BUT I DON'T LIKE THE SMELL OF THIS STABLE DO YOU THINK THE DRAINS ARE ALL RIGHT WELL SIR NOW YOU MENTION IT
JUST AS WE WERE MOVING OFF A FOOTMAN CAME OUT WITH A SLIP OF PAPER
I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MUCH OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT I FOUND THEY THOUGHT IF I HAD GONE ON AS THE MASTER WANTED ME MOST LIKELY THE BRIDGE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WAY UNDER US AND HORSE CHAISE MASTER
GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAY AND OATS EVERY NIGHT AND MORNING AND THE RUN OF THE MEADOW DURING THE DAY AND YOU WILLIE
TOUCHING HIS HAT AT EVERY WORD
AND I MUST DO HIM THE JUSTICE TO SAY THAT HE LET MY REIN OUT SEVERAL HOLES AND GOING UPHILL AFTER THAT HE ALWAYS GAVE ME MY HEAD BUT THE HEAVY LOADS WENT ON
BEAUTIFUL MOUTH AND GOOD PACES THEY CAN'T BE BETTER OH GRANDPAPA HOW GLAD I AM YOU BOUGHT HIM SO AM I MY BOY BUT HE HAS TO THANK YOU MORE THAN ME
NOW THE FACT WAS THAT HE HARDLY EVER DID EXERCISE ME AND WHEN THE MASTER WAS BUSY I OFTEN STOOD FOR DAYS TOGETHER WITHOUT STRETCHING MY LEGS AT ALL AND YET BEING FED JUST AS HIGH AS IF I WERE AT HARD WORK
AND ENCOURAGING ME TO RISE AFTER SOME MORE CORDIAL HAD BEEN GIVEN ME AND AFTER ONE OR TWO ATTEMPTS I STAGGERED TO MY FEET AND WAS GENTLY LED TO SOME STABLES WHICH WERE CLOSE BY
CONSIDERED HIMSELF VERY HANDSOME HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ABOUT HIS HAIR WHISKERS AND NECKTIE BEFORE A LITTLE LOOKING GLASS IN THE HARNESS ROOM WHEN HIS MASTER WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IT WAS ALWAYS YES SIR
OPEN THE GATES AND MOTHER WILL BRING US THE LANTERN THE NEXT MINUTE THEY WERE ALL STANDING ROUND ME IN A SMALL STABLE YARD IS HE GENTLE FATHER YES DOLLY AS GENTLE AS YOUR OWN KITTEN COME AND PAT HIM
A HUMBUG MY MASTER WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY SUITED BUT IN A FEW DAYS
THERE WERE ALSO OPEN SPACES OF FINE SHORT GRASS WITH ANT HILLS AND MOLE TURNS EVERYWHERE
PREACHING TO US AND THEN DOING THE SAME HIMSELF LOOK HERE MATES SAID JERRY THE GENTLEMAN OFFERED ME HALF A CROWN EXTRA BUT I DIDN'T TAKE IT TWAS QUITE PAY ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE HOW GLAD HE WAS TO CATCH THAT TRAIN
AND I HAVE FOLLOWED THE HOUNDS A GREAT MANY TIMES THOUGH I KNOW YOU DO NOT APPROVE OF LADIES HUNTING BUT STILL THAT IS THE FACT AND I INTEND TO TRY THIS LIZZIE
AND GOT THERE JUST AS THE DOCTOR RODE UP THERE WAS A WOMAN SITTING ON THE GROUND WITH THE LADY'S HEAD IN HER LAP THE DOCTOR POURED SOMETHING INTO HER MOUTH BUT ALL THAT I HEARD WAS SHE IS NOT DEAD THEN I WAS LED OFF BY A MAN
TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AFTER AWHILE SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE CARRIAGE AND WE CAME HOME TOGETHER I HEARD MY MASTER SAY TO A GENTLEMAN WHO STOPPED HIM TO INQUIRE THAT HE HOPED NO BONES WERE BROKEN BUT THAT SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN YET
AND IF A HORSE MAY SPEAK HIS MIND SO FAR AS HE UNDERSTANDS I SHOULD SAY THERE WERE MORE LIES TOLD AND MORE TRICKERY AT THAT HORSE FAIR
TWO DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT BLANTYRE PAID ME A VISIT HE PATTED ME AND PRAISED ME VERY MUCH HE TOLD LORD GEORGE THAT HE WAS SURE THE HORSE KNEW OF ANNIE'S DANGER AS WELL AS HE DID
HE WOULD SAY BUT HE IS IMPROVING SO STEADILY THAT I THINK WE SHALL SEE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER IN THE SPRING THE PERFECT REST THE GOOD FOOD THE SOFT TURF AND GENTLE EXERCISE
TILL IN THE TWILIGHT WE REACHED THE GREAT CITY THE GAS LAMPS WERE ALREADY LIGHTED THERE WERE STREETS TO THE RIGHT AND STREETS TO THE LEFT AND STREETS CROSSING EACH OTHER FOR MILE UPON MILE I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NEVER COME TO THE END OF THEM
USED TO MAKE ME FEEL ILL AND UNCOMFORTABLE ONE DAY MY FEET WERE SO TENDER
BUT NOW WITH A LIGHT HAND AND A PRACTICED EYE HE GUIDED ME OVER THE GROUND IN SUCH A MASTERLY MANNER THAT MY PACE WAS SCARCELY SLACKENED AND WE WERE DECIDEDLY GAINING ON THEM
BUT MY MIND WAS HURT QUITE AS MUCH AS MY POOR SIDES TO BE PUNISHED AND ABUSED WHEN I WAS DOING MY VERY BEST WAS SO HARD IT TOOK THE HEART OUT OF ME
FEEL HOW COLD HIS HANDS ARE THEY RAISED HIM UP BUT THERE WAS NO LIFE AND HIS HAIR WAS SOAKED WITH BLOOD THEY LAID HIM DOWN AGAIN AND CAME AND LOOKED AT ME
YES SIR SAID JOHN IT WOULD BE RATHER AWKWARD IF ONE OF THESE BRANCHES CAME DOWN UPON US THE WORDS WERE SCARCELY OUT OF HIS MOUTH
BESIDES SHE ADDED IN A VERY SERIOUS VOICE WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO DISTRESS ANY OF GOD'S CREATURES
BUT I SHOULD NEVER LOSE THE BLEMISH I BELIEVE THEY DID THE BEST TO MAKE A GOOD CURE BUT IT WAS A LONG AND PAINFUL ONE PROUD FLESH AS THEY CALLED IT CAME UP IN MY KNEES AND WAS BURNED OUT WITH CAUSTIC
JAKES AND THE LADY I WAS SOLD TO A CORN DEALER AND BAKER WHOM JERRY KNEW AND WITH HIM HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE GOOD FOOD AND FAIR WORK IN THE FIRST HE WAS QUITE RIGHT
NO SMELL OF OLD BEER AND TOBACCO WHICH I HATED BUT A FRESH SMELL AS IF HE HAD COME OUT OF A HAYLOFT HE OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS FOR ME BUT THAT WAS REFUSED AND HE WALKED AWAY
HOWEVER I ESCAPED WITHOUT ANY PERMANENT INJURY TO MY SIGHT
HE DROVE OUT OF THE STATION THE LOAD WAS VERY HEAVY AND I HAD HAD NEITHER FOOD NOR REST SINCE MORNING
BUT GINGER WHO KNEW MORE OF HER THAN I DID TOLD ME SHE WAS RATHER NERVOUS
THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE ME FEEL RATHER QUEER IF I WAS ONE OF THEM IF YOU EVER DO GET RICH SAID GOVERNOR GRAY LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER ACROSS THE TOP OF HIS CAB YOU'LL DESERVE IT JERRY
THOSE LINSEED MASHES WERE DELICIOUS AND I BEGAN TO THINK AFTER ALL
AND JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE FLYING FIGURE NOW FAR AWAY ON THE ROAD IN AN INSTANT HE SPRANG TO THE SADDLE I NEEDED NO WHIP NO SPUR FOR I WAS AS EAGER AS MY RIDER
AND YOU WON'T FIND A CURSE COME WITH YOUR WEALTH AS FOR YOU LARRY YOU'LL DIE POOR YOU SPEND TOO MUCH IN WHIPCORD WELL SAID LARRY WHAT IS A FELLOW TO DO IF HIS HORSE WON'T GO WITHOUT IT
AND THE HEAD GROOM WAS LEFT IN CHARGE THE LADY HARRIET WHO REMAINED AT THE HALL WAS A GREAT INVALID AND NEVER WENT OUT IN THE CARRIAGE AND THE LADY ANNE PREFERRED RIDING ON HORSEBACK WITH HER BROTHER OR COUSINS
I PUT OUT MY NOSE IN ANSWER TO HIS KINDNESS THE BOY STROKED MY FACE POOR OLD FELLOW SEE GRANDPAPA HOW WELL HE UNDERSTANDS KINDNESS
NO DOUBT A HORSE FAIR IS A VERY AMUSING PLACE TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AT ANY RATE THERE IS PLENTY TO SEE
WITH LADY ANNE'S MAID AND HELP I SHALL STAY HERE ALL RIGHT SIR
LONG BEFORE WE CAME TO THE BEND SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH WAY HAD SHE TURNED A WOMAN WAS STANDING AT HER GARDEN GATE SHADING HER EYES WITH HER HAND AND LOOKING EAGERLY UP THE ROAD
I COULD HEAR A POLICEMAN GIVING ORDERS BUT I DID NOT EVEN OPEN MY EYES I COULD ONLY DRAW A GASPING BREATH NOW AND THEN SOME COLD WATER WAS THROWN OVER MY HEAD
TILL WE CAME TO HIS GATE THERE WAS A SHORT DRIVE UP TO THE HOUSE BETWEEN TALL EVERGREENS BLANTYRE ALIGHTED AT THE GATE AND WAS GOING TO OPEN IT FOR LADY ANNE BUT SHE SAID I WILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE
THIS IS A CASE OF OVERWORK MORE THAN DISEASE
SAID HIS MASTER YES SIR I WILL THE BRICKLAYER CAME AND PULLED UP A GREAT MANY BRICKS BUT FOUND NOTHING AMISS SO HE PUT DOWN SOME LIME AND CHARGED THE MASTER FIVE SHILLINGS
LET ME BEG YOU TO HAVE THE SADDLES CHANGED MY DEAR COUSIN SAID LADY ANNE LAUGHING PRAY DO NOT TROUBLE YOUR GOOD CAREFUL HEAD ABOUT ME I HAVE BEEN A HORSEWOMAN EVER SINCE I WAS A BABY
AND A GOOD HORSE WHO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER ARE OF ONE MIND IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT THEY CAN DO I HAD A VERY GOOD MOUTH THAT IS I COULD BE GUIDED BY THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF THE REIN AND THAT IS A GREAT THING IN LONDON
BEGAN TO THINK HE SHOULD NOT GET ALL HE ASKED AND MUST COME DOWN BUT JUST THEN THE GRAY EYED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN I COULD NOT HELP REACHING OUT MY HEAD TOWARD HIM HE STROKED MY FACE KINDLY
IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE GINGER CAME BACK AND BEFORE WE WERE LEFT ALONE AND THEN SHE TOLD ME ALL THAT SHE HAD SEEN I CAN'T TELL MUCH SHE SAID WE WENT A GALLOP NEARLY ALL THE WAY
COULD NOT YOU BUY HIM AND MAKE HIM YOUNG AGAIN AS YOU DID WITH LADYBIRD MY DEAR BOY I CAN'T MAKE ALL OLD HORSES YOUNG BESIDES LADYBIRD WAS NOT SO VERY OLD AS SHE WAS RUN DOWN AND BADLY USED
I NEVER KNEW TILL NOW THE UTTER MISERY OF A CAB HORSE'S LIFE SKINNER HAD A LOW SET OF CABS AND A LOW SET OF DRIVERS HE WAS HARD ON THE MEN AND THE MEN
MY NEW MASTER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HE HAD BLACK EYES AND A HOOKED NOSE HIS MOUTH WAS AS FULL OF TEETH AS A BULL DOG'S AND HIS VOICE WAS AS HARSH AS THE GRINDING OF CART WHEELS
THERE WAS A PARTY OF FOUR A NOISY BLUSTERING MAN WITH A LADY
THE MAN TOOK UP MY FEET ONE BY ONE AND EXAMINED THEM THEN STANDING UP AND DUSTING HIS HANDS ONE AGAINST THE OTHER HE SAID YOUR HORSE HAS GOT THE THRUSH AND BADLY TOO
AND THERE WERE SOME VERY DEJECTED LOOKING OLD HORSES WITH THE UNDER LIP HANGING DOWN AND THE EARS LYING BACK HEAVILY AS IF THERE WERE NO MORE PLEASURE IN LIFE AND NO MORE HOPE THERE WERE SOME SO THIN YOU MIGHT SEE ALL THEIR RIBS
WOULD SET HIM RIGHT UP BEING AS HOW HIS WIND WAS NOT BROKEN I'VE HAD THE TENDING OF HIM THESE TEN DAYS PAST AND A GRATEFULLER PLEASANTER ANIMAL I NEVER MET WITH
THAT USED TO COOL US DOWN AND MAKE US SO COMFORTABLE THEN WE HAD TWO NIGHTS AND A WHOLE DAY FOR UNBROKEN REST AND ON MONDAY MORNING WE WERE AS FRESH AS YOUNG HORSES AGAIN
A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN I GENERALLY GET SAID HE NODDING SLYLY WHAT HE GAVE ME WILL KEEP ME IN LITTLE COMFORTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS GAMMON SAID ONE HE'S A HUMBUG SAID ANOTHER
STAYING AT THE HALL HE ALWAYS RODE LIZZIE AND PRAISED HER SO MUCH THAT ONE DAY LADY ANNE ORDERED THE SIDE SADDLE TO BE PUT ON HER AND THE OTHER SADDLE ON ME WHEN WE CAME TO THE DOOR THE GENTLEMAN SEEMED VERY UNEASY
I BELIEVE HAD I STAYED THERE VERY LONG I SHOULD HAVE BECOME PURBLIND AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR I HAVE HEARD MEN SAY THAT A STONE BLIND HORSE WAS SAFER TO DRIVE THAN ONE WHICH HAD IMPERFECT SIGHT
SO PLEASE HELP ME TO MOUNT LIKE A GOOD FRIEND AS YOU ARE THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE SAID HE PLACED HER CAREFULLY ON THE SADDLE LOOKED TO THE BIT AND CURB GAVE THE REINS GENTLY INTO HER HAND AND THEN MOUNTED ME
I FOUND THE WORK TELLING VERY MUCH ON MY STRENGTH ONE DAY I WAS LOADED MORE THAN USUAL AND PART OF THE ROAD WAS A STEEP UPHILL I USED ALL MY STRENGTH
AND AS WE CAME UP MISTRESS RAN OUT SAYING ARE YOU REALLY SAFE MY DEAR OH I HAVE BEEN SO ANXIOUS
AND QUICK IN ALL HIS MOTIONS I KNEW IN A MOMENT BY THE WAY HE HANDLED ME THAT HE WAS USED TO HORSES HE SPOKE GENTLY AND HIS GRAY EYE HAD A KINDLY CHEERY LOOK IN IT IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO SAY
LOOSENED HER COLLAR FELT HER HANDS AND WRIST THEN STARTED UP AND LOOKED WILDLY ROUND HIM FOR HELP AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE WERE TWO MEN CUTTING TURF WHO SEEING LIZZIE RUNNING WILD WITHOUT A RIDER
MY LEGS WERE NOT STIFF NOW AND I DID THE WORK WITH PERFECT EASE HE'S GROWING YOUNG WILLIE WE MUST GIVE HIM A LITTLE GENTLE WORK NOW AND BY MID SUMMER HE WILL BE AS GOOD AS LADYBIRD HE HAS A
AND MY SHOE WAS PICKED UP AMONG THE STONES SO THAT THE CASE WAS QUITE PLAIN TO THEM AND I WAS CLEARED OF ALL BLAME EVERYBODY PITIED SUSAN SHE WAS NEARLY OUT OF HER MIND
HE COULD TAKE MORE THAN THAT AND HE HELPED TO HAUL UP A BOX SO HEAVY
AND LEANING A LITTLE FORWARD WE DASHED AFTER THEM FOR ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF THE ROAD RAN STRAIGHT AND THEN BENT TO THE RIGHT AFTER WHICH IT DIVIDED INTO TWO ROADS
JERRY BARKER I NEVER KNEW A BETTER MAN THAN MY NEW MASTER HE WAS KIND AND GOOD AND AS STRONG FOR THE RIGHT AS JOHN MANLY AND SO GOOD TEMPERED AND MERRY THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE COULD PICK A QUARREL WITH HIM
THANK GOD SAID MY MASTER YOU BEAUTY SAID JOHN AND TOOK THE BRIDLE AND GENTLY TURNED ME ROUND TO THE RIGHT HAND ROAD BY THE RIVER SIDE THE SUN HAD SET SOME TIME
I HEARD NO MORE AS THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND JOHN TOOK ME TO THE STABLE OH WHAT A GOOD SUPPER HE GAVE ME THAT NIGHT A GOOD BRAN MASH AND SOME CRUSHED BEANS WITH MY OATS AND SUCH A THICK BED OF STRAW
THERE WAS NO SOUND GENTLY HE TURNED HER FACE UPWARD IT WAS GHASTLY WHITE AND THE EYES WERE CLOSED ANNIE DEAR ANNIE DO SPEAK BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER HE UNBUTTONED HER HABIT
CAN YOU TAKE ME TO THE SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY SAID THE YOUNG MAN THIS UNLUCKY FALL HAS MADE ME LATE I FEAR BUT IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT I SHOULD NOT LOSE THE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN I SHOULD BE MOST THANKFUL IF YOU COULD GET ME THERE IN TIME
AND NEARER THE ROAD TO EARLSHALL LED THROUGH WOODS THAT BELONGED TO THE EARL THE SOUND CAME IN THAT DIRECTION AND I HOPED IT MIGHT BE SOME ONE COMING IN SEARCH OF US AS THE SOUND CAME NEARER AND NEARER
AND WILL GLADLY PAY YOU AN EXTRA FARE I'LL DO MY VERY BEST SAID JERRY HEARTILY IF YOU THINK YOU ARE WELL ENOUGH SIR FOR HE LOOKED DREADFULLY WHITE AND ILL I MUST GO HE SAID EARNESTLY
I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT NIGHT WALK IT WAS MORE THAN THREE MILES ROBERT LED ME ON VERY SLOWLY
FEARING SOME ACCIDENT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT SHE HAD SENT JAMES OFF ON JUSTICE THE ROAN COB TOWARD THE WOODEN BRIDGE TO MAKE INQUIRY AFTER US WE SAW A LIGHT AT THE HALL DOOR AND AT THE UPPER WINDOWS
AND AS THE CURRENT WAS FLOWING VERY STRONGLY AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT AND NO HELP AT HAND
WITH VOICES THAT I COULD TRUST THERE WAS ONE TOTTERING OLD MAN WHO TOOK A GREAT FANCY TO ME AND I TO HIM BUT I WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH IT WAS AN ANXIOUS TIME
WHEN THERE WAS A GROAN AND A CRACK AND A SPLITTING SOUND AND TEARING CRASHING DOWN AMONG THE OTHER TREES CAME AN OAK TORN UP BY THE ROOTS AND IT FELL RIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD JUST BEFORE US
IT VERY MUCH WEAKENED MY SIGHT AND WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT OUT OF THE DARKNESS INTO THE GLARE OF DAYLIGHT IT WAS VERY PAINFUL TO MY EYES SEVERAL TIMES I STUMBLED OVER THE THRESHOLD AND COULD SCARCELY SEE WHERE I WAS GOING
I THANK YOU FOR TRYING MY PLAN WITH YOUR GOOD HORSE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL FIND IT FAR BETTER THAN THE WHIP GOOD DAY AND WITH ANOTHER SOFT PAT ON MY NECK SHE STEPPED LIGHTLY ACROSS THE PATH AND I SAW HER NO MORE
AND I MADE A DEAD STOP GO ON BEAUTY SAID MY MASTER AND HE GAVE ME A TOUCH WITH THE WHIP BUT I DARE NOT STIR HE GAVE ME A SHARP CUT I JUMPED BUT I DARE NOT GO FORWARD
THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE WERE TAKEN OFF AND A CLOTH THROWN OVER ME GINGER WAS SADDLED AND SENT OFF IN GREAT HASTE FOR LORD GEORGE AND I SOON HEARD THE CARRIAGE ROLL OUT OF THE YARD
AFTER ALL HE HAD FELT ALL THAT LONG AGO
HE POINTED OVER THEIR HEADS
I'M SO SORRY SO SORRY BUT YOU MUST LET ME HELP YOU YOU WILL LET ME HELP YOU HE SAID HE TOOK HER HANDS AND PRESSED THEM TOGETHER BETWEEN HIS
YET THERE WAS NO HARD EDGE OF VANITY IN HER SENSE OF HER PRETTINESS SHE SEEMED SIMPLY TO BE AWARE OF IT AS A NOTE IN THE GENERAL HARMONY AND TO ENJOY SOUNDING THE NOTE AS A SINGER ENJOYS SINGING AFTER LUNCHEON AS THEY SAT OVER THEIR COFFEE
WHEN THEY CAME IN THEY SAT BESIDE THE FIRE IN THE OAK DRAWING ROOM AND DARROW NOTICED HOW DELICATELY HER HEAD STOOD OUT AGAINST THE SOMBRE PANELLING AND MUSED ON THE ENJOYMENT THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE IN THE MERE FACT OF WATCHING HER HANDS AS THEY MOVED ABOUT AMONG THE TEA THINGS
EVERYTHING ENTERTAINED AND INTERESTED HER AND DARROW REMARKED WITH AN AMUSED DETACHMENT
SO WELL PLACED HERE YOU SHOULD SHOW MORE ANXIETY ABOUT MY FUTURE THAN AT A TIME WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY AND RATHER DESPERATELY ADRIFT OH NO NOT MORE IF YOU SHOW ANY AT ALL IT MUST AT ANY RATE BE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS
THEN YOU MIGHT NATURALLY FEEL YOURSELF JUSTIFIED IN TELLING HER THAT YOU DON'T THINK I'M THE RIGHT PERSON FOR EFFIE HE UTTERED A SOUND OF PROTEST BUT SHE DISREGARDED IT I DON'T SAY YOU'D LIKE TO DO IT YOU WOULDN'T YOU'D HATE IT
THE PLAYERS WERE THE SAME WHOM HE HAD OFTEN APPLAUDED IN THOSE VERY PARTS AND PERHAPS THAT FACT ADDED TO THE IMPRESSION OF STALENESS AND CONVENTIONALITY PRODUCED BY THEIR PERFORMANCE SURELY IT WAS TIME TO INFUSE NEW BLOOD INTO THE VEINS OF THE MORIBUND ART
INCREASED BY ITS FADED HANGINGS ITS SLIGHTLY FRAYED AND THREADBARE RUGS EVERYTHING IN IT WAS HARMONIOUSLY SHABBY
HIS GLANCE STRAYED DOWN THE GOLD ROOFED WINDINGS AHEAD OF THEM IT'S DELIGHTFUL YOU COULDN'T BE BETTER PLACED ONLY I WONDER A LITTLE AT YOUR HAVING SO COMPLETELY GIVEN UP ANY IDEA OF A DIFFERENT FUTURE
SHE TRIED TO DEVISE MEANS OF KEEPING THE LITTLE GIRL WITH HER AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD BEEN CALLED AWAY BY THE NURSE FOUND AN EXCUSE FOR FOLLOWING MADAME DE CHANTELLE UPSTAIRS TO THE PURPLE SITTING ROOM
BUT HE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT WITH THE SECURING OF MISS VINER'S PEACE OF MIND ONLY A PART OF HIS OBLIGATION WAS DISCHARGED AND THAT WITH THAT PART HIS REMAINING DUTY WAS IN CONFLICT IT HAD BEEN HIS FIRST BUSINESS TO CONVINCE THE GIRL
IT'S ALL THE ODDER BECAUSE MY MOTHER IN LAW SINCE HER SECOND MARRIAGE HAS LIVED SO MUCH IN THE COUNTRY THAT SHE'S PRACTICALLY LOST SIGHT OF ALL HER OTHER AMERICAN FRIENDS BESIDES WHICH
YES ALL IS AT AN END BETWEEN US WE'VE JUST PARTED IN TEARS BUT NOT IN SILENCE JUST PARTED
TO HAVE ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE NEVER HAD IT'S NOT ALWAYS MAY AND PARIS WHY NOT MAKE THE MOST OF THEM NOW YOU KNOW ME WE'RE NOT STRANGERS WHY SHOULDN'T YOU TREAT ME LIKE A FRIEND WHILE HE SPOKE SHE HAD DRAWN AWAY A LITTLE BUT HER HAND STILL LAY IN HIS
I MUST DECIDE ON SOMETHING SHE REPEATED
REVEALED NOT PERHAPS A PERSONAL PREOCCUPATION BUT A VAGUE SENSE OF IMPENDING DISTURBANCE SHE SMILED SHE BORE A PART IN THE TALK HER EYES DWELT ON DARROW'S WITH THEIR USUAL DEEP RELIANCE
TO THE DISMAL DRUDGERY OF TEACHING AND IS THAT WHAT YOU'VE TOLD MISSUS LEATH SHE RUSHED THE QUESTION OUT AT HIM AS IF SHE EXPECTED TO TRIP HIM UP OVER IT HE WAS MOVED BY THE SIMPLICITY OF THE STRATAGEM
IF THE EPISODE HAD BEEN AN ISOLATED ACCIDENT
AND THE PLEASURE YOU'LL BE GIVING ME LET'S SHAKE HANDS ON IT
AND THE NATURAL ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO TRY TO PERSUADE ME THAT I'D BE BETTER OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE THAN HERE BUT SUPPOSING THAT FAILED AND YOU SAW I WAS DETERMINED TO STAY THEN YOU MIGHT THINK IT YOUR DUTY TO TELL MISSUS LEATH
NO SHE HEARD FROM ADELAIDE THAT I WAS IN PARIS AND SHE CAME SHE CAME BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO URGE ME TO MARRY YOU
HE MERELY PERCEIVED THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS UNACCOUNTABLY SURPRISED AT FINDING HIM WITH MISS VINER AND THAT THE EXTENT OF HIS SURPRISE MIGHT COVER ALL MANNER OF IMPLICATIONS DARROW'S FIRST IDEA WAS THAT OWEN
ONLY I SHALL BE SORRY HE ENDED OH BUT I SHALL BE SORRY TOO
NOT ME I HOPE NO NOT YOU I LIKE YOU IT'S THE MONEY WITH ME THAT'S ALWAYS THE ROOT OF THE MATTER
DARROW STOOD STILL IN THE PATH BEHIND HIM HE HEARD EFFIE'S CALL AND AT THE CHILD'S VOICE HE SAW SOPHY TURN HER HEAD WITH THE ALERTNESS OF ONE WHO IS OBSCURELY ON THE WATCH
YOU'D STUCK IT OUT LONGER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS COULDN'T YOU AT LEAST HAVE HELD ON TILL YOU WERE SURE OF SOME KIND OF AN OPENING
RECALLED THE FAINT CURVES OF A TERRA COTTA STATUETTE SOME YOUNG IMAGE OF GRACE HARDLY MORE THAN SKETCHED IN THE CLAY DARROW AS HE STOOD LOOKING AT HER REFLECTED THAT HER CHARACTER FOR ALL ITS SEEMING FIRMNESS ITS FLASHING EDGES OF OPINION WAS PROBABLY NO LESS IMMATURE
SHE LIFTED HER EYES TO HIS FACE I THINK I ONLY WANTED TO SPEAK HER NAME IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD SEEM SO AFRAID OF IT IF I WERE REALLY AFRAID OF IT I SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE YOU UP SHE SAID
I DIDN'T SEE WHY WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A FEW HOURS TOGETHER FIRST SO I LEFT YOUR LETTER IN MY POCKET HE SAW HER FACE MELT AS SHE LISTENED AND SUDDENLY SHE UNCLASPED HER HANDS AND LEANED TO HIM BUT ARE YOU UNHAPPY TOO
SO WHAT DID IT MATTER IF THEY WENT THERE THE PORTER INTERROGATED WAS NOT SURE HE HIMSELF HAD RECEIVED NOTHING FOR THE LADY
AS HE STOOD THERE IN THE LAMP LIGHT WITH DEAD LEAVES AND BITS OF BRAMBLE CLINGING TO HIS MUD SPATTERED CLOTHES THE SCENT OF THE NIGHT ABOUT HIM AND ITS CHILL ON HIS PALE BRIGHT FACE HE REALLY HAD THE LOOK OF A YOUNG FAUN STRAYED IN FROM THE FOREST EFFIE ABANDONED THE TERRIER TO FLY TO HIM
OF WHICH ANNA COULD HARDLY YET BEAR TO CONSIDER THE VAGUEST OUTLINE THE DATE OF HER MARRIAGE THE RELATIVE ADVANTAGES OF SAILING FROM LONDON OR LISBON THE POSSIBILITY OF HIRING A HABITABLE HOUSE AT THEIR NEW POST AND WHEN THESE PROBLEMS WERE EXHAUSTED
BUT IT'S BARELY TEN MINUTES PAST LET'S AT LEAST WALK A LITTLE WAY TOWARD THE RIVER SHE GLANCED DOWN THE LONG WALK AHEAD OF THEM AND THEN BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE IF YOU LIKE
LET'S BE QUIET THEN IT'S THE BEST WAY OF TALKING YES BUT WE MUST SAVE IT UP TILL LATER
THERE WAS IN THEM AN UNDEFINABLE APPEAL WHETHER FOR HELP OR FORBEARANCE HE COULD NOT TELL THEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING MISLEADING IN HIS SO POINTEDLY SEEKING HER AND HE FELT A MOMENTARY CONSTRAINT
SHE MADE NO ANSWER AND HE SIGNED TO A MOTOR CAB CALLING OUT TO THE DRIVER TO THE BOIS AS THE CARRIAGE TURNED TOWARD THE TUILERIES SHE ROUSED HERSELF I MUST GO FIRST TO THE HOTEL THERE MAY BE A MESSAGE AT ANY RATE I MUST DECIDE ON SOMETHING
LESS OF HER WORDS THAN OF HER LOOK AND OF THE EFFORT THE QUESTION COST HER THE REDDENING OF HER CHEEK THE DEEPENING OF THE STRAINED LINE BETWEEN HER BROWS
AND FELT THAT THIS FACT SOMEHOW JUSTIFIED AND ENNOBLED HIS INSTINCTIVE BOYISH SATISFACTION IN LOVING HER HE STOOD UP
IF HE SUSPECTED THAT THE CONVERSATION WAS NOT THE RESULT OF AN ACCIDENTAL ENCOUNTER MIGHT WONDER AT HIS STEP MOTHER'S SUITOR BEING ENGAGED AT SUCH AN HOUR IN PRIVATE TALK WITH HER LITTLE GIRL'S GOVERNESS
WHEN THE PLAY WAS OVER AND THEY CAME OUT ONCE MORE INTO THE SUNLIGHT DARROW LOOKED DOWN AT HER WITH A SMILE WELL HE ASKED SHE MADE NO ANSWER HER DARK GAZE SEEMED TO REST ON HIM WITHOUT SEEING HIM HER CHEEKS AND LIPS WERE PALE
HOW I SHOULD LIKE HER IF I DIDN'T LOVE HER HE SUMMED IT UP
SHE LOOKED UP HER LIPS PARTED IN SURPRISE BUT BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK HE WENT ON I WANT YOU TO STAY WITH ME
HE PAUSED AGAIN AND THEN WENT ON IN THE SAME TONE OF FRIENDLY REASONABLENESS
SHE LET HER AMUSED SCRUTINY DWELL ON HIM BUT HOW COULD YOU SHE WAS FALSE FROM HEAD TO FOOT
THAT YOU PUT IT ALL IN THE PAST TENSE
AND HIS MEETING WITH MISSUS LEATH THE PREVIOUS SPRING HAD GIVEN IT A DEFINITE DIRECTION WITH SUCH A COMRADE TO FOCUS AND STIMULATE HIS ENERGIES HE FELT MODESTLY BUT AGREEABLY SURE OF
WHATEVER WORDS HE CHOSE HE SEEMED TO STUMBLE AMONG REMINDERS OF THEIR PAST SHE WALKED ON BESIDE HIM HER EYES ON THE GROUND THEN I'M TO UNDERSTAND DEFINITELY THAT YOU DO RENEW YOUR OFFER SHE ASKED
SHE HUNG BEFORE HIM LIKE A LEAF ON THE MEETING OF CROSS CURRENTS THAT THE NEXT RIPPLE MAY SWEEP FORWARD OR WHIRL BACK
WILL NATURE NEVER TIRE OF THE TRICK BUT HE KNEW IT WAS MORE THAN THAT THERE WERE MOMENTS IN THEIR TALK WHEN HE FELT
IS IT TRUE IS IT REALLY TRUE
THEY WERE SO NEARLY OF AN AGE THAT ALREADY SHE FELT HERSELF HIS SENIOR AS YET THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT VISIBLE OUTWARDLY AT LEAST THEY WERE MATCHED
THIS OBSCURED IF IT NARROWED THE FIELD OF CONJECTURE AND DARROW'S GROPINGS THREW HIM BACK ON THE CONCLUSION THAT HE WAS PROBABLY READING TOO MUCH SIGNIFICANCE INTO THE MOODS OF A LAD HE HARDLY KNEW
HE HAD STAKED SOMETHING MORE ON IT AND HAD SOMEHOW IN THE SEQUEL HAD A MORE PALPABLE LOSS TO SHOW BUT THE PLAIN FACT WAS THAT HE HADN'T SPENT A PENNY ON IT WHICH WAS NO DOUBT THE REASON OF THE PRODIGIOUS SCORE IT HAD SINCE BEEN ROLLING UP
THEN SHE SNATCHED AWAY HER HAND YOU DIDN'T POST MY LETTER YOU KEPT IT BACK ON PURPOSE AND YOU TELL ME SO NOW TO PROVE TO ME THAT I'D BETTER PUT MYSELF UNDER YOUR PROTECTION
MUCH LESS TWO WHOLE DAYS OF IT I SHA'N'T FORGET HOW KIND YOU'VE BEEN
BUT SHE FELT WHAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN UNPERCEIVED BY MANY A YOUNG LADY WHO HAD TAKEN A FIRST IN CLASSICS THE INELUCTABLE FATALITY OF THE TALE THE DREAD SWAY IN IT OF THE SAME MYSTERIOUS LUCK WHICH PULLED THE THREADS OF HER OWN SMALL DESTINY
FARTHER OFF THE MEADOWS UNROLLED A SILVER SHOT TISSUE TO THE MANTLING OF MIST ABOVE THE RIVER AND THE AUTUMN STARS TREMBLED OVERHEAD LIKE THEIR OWN REFLECTIONS SEEN IN DIM WATER HE LIT HIS CIGAR AND THEY WALKED SLOWLY UP AND DOWN THE FLAGS IN THE LANGUID AIR
TELL ME JUST WHAT YOU THINK HE SAID BENDING HIS HEAD A LITTLE AND ONLY HALF AWARE OF HIS WORDS SHE DID NOT TURN HER FACE TO HIS BUT BEGAN TO TALK RAPIDLY TRYING TO CONVEY SOMETHING OF WHAT SHE FELT
IF SHE HAD GONE ON DOUBTING HIM HE COULD PROBABLY HAVE GONE ON DECEIVING HER
TO WALK AFTER HER DOWN THE AISLE OF A THEATRE
YET SOMEHOW I DON'T SEEM TO SEE YOU PERMANENTLY GIVEN UP TO FORMING THE YOUNG WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU SEEM TO SEE ME PERMANENTLY GIVEN UP TO YOU KNOW YOU WARNED ME RATHER EMPHATICALLY AGAINST THE THEATRE
AND NOT THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN ME SINCE AND NOT THAT I'VE EVER SEEN YOU SINCE AND SHE BELIEVES YOU SHE COMPLETELY BELIEVES YOU HE UTTERED A PROTESTING EXCLAMATION AND HIS FLUSH REFLECTED ITSELF IN THE GIRL'S CHEEK
IT WAS NOT LITERATURE TO HER IT WAS FACT AS ACTUAL AS NEAR BY
INSTANTLY EFFACED BY THE EXCITEMENT OF PURSUIT WELL THEN HE STOOD LOOKING DOWN ON HER HIS EYES PERSUADING HER HE WAS NOW INTENSELY AWARE THAT HIS NEARNESS WAS HAVING AN EFFECT WHICH MADE IT LESS AND LESS NECESSARY FOR HIM TO CHOOSE HIS WORDS AND HE WENT ON
EVER SINCE YOU USED TO COME THERE TO SEE LADY ULRICA DOES IT SEEM TO YOU SO AWFULLY LONG AGO
SHE'S BEEN EXCEEDINGLY GENEROUS WHY SHOULDN'T WE SPEAK OF IT SHE HAD LOWERED HER HEAD BUT THROUGH HER DROPPED LIDS SHE SEEMED TO BE WATCHING THE CROWDED SCENE OF HIS FACE I'VE NOT SHRUNK FROM SPEAKING OF IT SPEAKING OF HER THEN I MEAN
HIS OWN IDEAS ABOUT SOPHY VINER WERE TOO MIXED AND INDETERMINATE FOR HIM NOT TO FEEL THE RISK OF SUCH AN EXPERIMENT YET HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE INTOLERABLE POSITION OF APPEARING TO PRESS IT ON THE WOMAN HE DESIRED ABOVE ALL OTHERS TO PROTECT
THE RETREAT IN WHICH AS ONE MIGHT FANCY
FOR A MOMENT IT OCCURRED TO DARROW THAT ANNA MIGHT HAVE EMPLOYED HER AFTERNOON IN PREPARING MADAME DE CHANTELLE FOR HER GRANDSON'S IMPENDING ANNOUNCEMENT BUT A GLANCE AT THE ELDER LADY'S UNCLOUDED BROW SHOWED THAT HE MUST SEEK ELSEWHERE THE CLUE TO OWEN'S TACITURNITY
IS THAT ALL HE LAUGHED RELIEVED BY HER NATURALNESS LOOK HERE
WHO HAVING COME TO PARIS SOME THIRTY YEARS EARLIER TO NURSE A BROTHER THROUGH AN ILLNESS HAD EVER SINCE PROTESTINGLY AND PROVISIONALLY CAMPED THERE IN A STATE OF CONTEMPTUOUS PROTESTATION ODDLY MANIFESTED BY HER NEVER TAKING THE SLIP COVERS OFF HER DRAWING ROOM CHAIRS
BUT AS HIS EYE FELL ON MISS VINER HIS EXPRESSION ALTERED AS SUDDENLY AS HERS THE CHANGE FOR DARROW WAS LESS DEFINABLE BUT PERHAPS FOR THAT REASON IT STRUCK HIM AS MORE SHARPLY SIGNIFICANT
OH IT'S NOT THAT SHE EXCLAIMED ALMOST IMPATIENTLY IT'S NOT PEOPLE I'M AFRAID OF THEY'VE NEVER PUT THEMSELVES OUT FOR ME WHY ON EARTH SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THEM HE LIKED HER DIRECTNESS AS HE HAD NEVER LIKED IT BEFORE WELL THEN WHAT IS IT
BUT NO HE HAD BEEN RIGHT IN JUDGING THE PERFORMANCE TO BE DULL AND STALE IT WAS SIMPLY HIS COMPANION'S INEXPERIENCE HER LACK OF OCCASIONS TO COMPARE AND ESTIMATE THAT MADE HER THINK IT BRILLIANT
HE CRIED THROWING OUT HIS HANDS WITH A LAUGH HER FACE INSTANTLY MELTED TO LAUGHTER WELL THEN I WON'T BE SORRY I WON'T REGRET ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT OUR GOOD TIME IS OVER THE WORDS WERE SO UNEXPECTED THAT THEY ROUTED ALL HIS RESOLVES
CAN'T YOU TRUST ME ABOUT THAT TOO TRUST YOU HOW DO YOU MEAN
SUCH TRUSTFULNESS SEEMED OPEN TO SUSPICION BUT THE MOMENT HIS EYES FELL ON HER HE WAS ASHAMED OF THE THOUGHT AND KNEW IT FOR WHAT IT REALLY WAS ANOTHER PRETEXT TO LESSEN HIS OWN DELINQUENCY WHY SHOULD OUR GOOD TIME BE OVER HE ASKED
THE LOOK WAS SO FUGITIVE THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID WHEREIN IT DIFFERED FROM HER NORMAL PROFESSIONAL AIR OF HAVING HER PUPIL ON HER MIND EFFIE SPRANG PAST THEM AND DARROW TOOK UP THE GIRL'S CHALLENGE
AND CONJECTURING THAT HER GOVERNESS MIGHT BE WITH HER HE BETOOK HIMSELF THE NEXT MORNING TO THE TERRACE WHENCE HE WANDERED ON TO THE GARDENS AND THE WALKS BEYOND THE ATMOSPHERE WAS STILL AND PALE
THEY DINED LATE AND FACING HER ACROSS THE TABLE WITH ITS LOW LIGHTS AND FLOWERS
BUT HIS SENSE OF HER WORDS WAS LOST IN THE SURPRISE OF HER FACE UNDER THE FLYING CLOUDS OF HER EXCITEMENT IT WAS NO LONGER A SHALLOW FLOWER CUP BUT A DARKENING GLEAMING MIRROR THAT MIGHT GIVE BACK STRANGE DEPTHS OF FEELING THE GIRL HAD STUFF IN HER HE SAW IT
IT'S NOT A BIT LIKE YOU TO LET ANYTHING STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR SAYING JUST WHAT YOU FEEL
BORNE ON FANTASTIC CHORDS FLOATED TO THE GROUP ABOUT THE TEA TABLE UNDER ITS INFLUENCE MADAME DE CHANTELLE'S MEDITATIVE PAUSES INCREASED IN LENGTH AND FREQUENCY
AT DINNER THAT EVENING MADAME DE CHANTELLE'S SLENDER MONOLOGUE WAS THROWN OUT OVER GULFS OF SILENCE OWEN WAS STILL IN THE SAME STATE OF MOODY ABSTRACTION AS WHEN DARROW HAD LEFT HIM AT THE PIANO AND EVEN ANNA'S FACE TO HER FRIEND'S VIGILANT EYE
HE HAD DONE WHAT WAS POSSIBLE TO REASSURE THE GIRL AND SHE HAD APPARENTLY RECOGNIZED THE SINCERITY OF HIS INTENTION HE HAD PATCHED UP AS DECENT A CONCLUSION AS HE COULD TO AN INCIDENT THAT SHOULD OBVIOUSLY HAVE HAD NO SEQUEL
AND WAS RESOLUTELY BENT ON HOLDING HER TO HER OWN PURPOSE OF BEHAVING AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED ONCE MORE SHE INWARDLY ACCUSED HIM OF INSENSIBILITY AND HER IMAGINATION WAS BESET BY TORMENTING VISIONS OF HIS PAST HAD SUCH THINGS HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE
BUT THAT MOTIVE AFTER ALL HAD SIMPLY BEEN TRUMPED UP TO JUSTIFY HIS OWN DISLOYALTY
HE'D BEEN CASHIERED FROM THE NAVY FOR DRUNKENNESS THE OTHER WAS A DEAF WIDOWER WITH THREE GROWN UP DAUGHTERS WHO KEPT A CLOCK SHOP IN BAYSWATER BESIDES SHE RAMBLED ON I'M NOT SO SURE THAT I BELIEVE IN MARRIAGE
THE DOOR OPENED AND SOPHY VINER ENTERED SEEING DARROW SHE DREW BACK DO COME IN MISS VINER ANNA REPEATED LOOKING AT HER KINDLY THE GIRL A QUICK RED IN HER CHEEKS STILL HESITATED ON THE THRESHOLD I'M SO SORRY
ON THE BRIGHT HAZE OF EFFIE'S HAIR AND ON THE WHITENESS OF ANNA'S FOREHEAD AS SHE LEANED BACK IN HER CHAIR BEHIND THE TEA URN SHE DID NOT MOVE AT DARROW'S APPROACH BUT LIFTED TO HIM A DEEP GAZE OF PEACE AND CONFIDENCE THE LOOK SEEMED TO THROW ABOUT HIM THE SPELL OF A DIVINE SECURITY
IMPORTANT ON EFFIE'S ACCOUNT ON EFFIE'S ACCOUNT OF COURSE OF COURSE BUT YOU'VE EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED HAVEN'T YOU
AS FOR THE PRIVATE AND PERSONAL SIDE OF HIS LIFE IT HAD COME UP TO THE CURRENT STANDARDS AND IF IT HAD DROPPED NOW AND THEN BELOW A MORE IDEAL MEASURE EVEN THESE DECLINES HAD BEEN BRIEF PARENTHETIC INCIDENTAL
WHAT DOES ANYTHING MATTER BUT JUST THIS MUST I GO NOW HE ADDED ALOUD SHE ANSWERED ABSENTLY IT MUST BE TIME TO DRESS
TILL LATE IN THE NIGHT HIS THOUGHTS REVOLVED IN A TURMOIL OF INDECISION HIS PRIDE WAS HUMBLED BY THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT SOPHY VINER HAD BEEN TO HIM AND WHAT HE HAD THOUGHT OF HER THIS DISCREPANCY
SHE WAS RESOLVED TO KEEP ON HER COURSE AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED TO MARRY DARROW AND NEVER LET THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PAST INTRUDE ITSELF BETWEEN THEM BUT SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THAT THE ONLY WAY OF ATTAINING TO THIS STATE OF DETACHMENT FROM THE IRREPARABLE
BUT FRASER LEATH HAD GROWN SO UNIMPORTANT A FACTOR IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS THAT THESE MARKS OF HIS PRESENCE CAUSED THE YOUNG MAN NO EMOTION BEYOND THAT OF A FAINT RETROSPECTIVE AMUSEMENT THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HAD BEEN PERFECT
MORE DISCONCERTINGLY TO HER COMPANION AND MORE PERILOUSLY TO HERSELF BE A SHIFTING AND UNCRYSTALLIZED MIXTURE OF THEM ALL HER TALK AS USUAL HAD PROMPTLY REVERTED TO THE STAGE
NOR DARROW TO THE TEMPTATION OF BELITTLING HER IN THE EFFORT TO BETTER HIS OWN CASE THE GIRL HAD BEEN MAGNIFICENT AND THE ONLY WORTHY RETURN THAT ANNA COULD MAKE WAS TO TAKE DARROW FROM HER WITHOUT A QUESTION IF SHE TOOK HIM AT ALL
THEN YOU NEVER REALLY SAW ANYTHING OF HER THERE
AND DARROW HAD LED MISS VINER OUT ON THE BALCONY OVERHANGING THE SQUARE BEFORE THE THEATRE HE TURNED TO SEE IF SHE SHARED HIS FEELINGS BUT THE RAPTUROUS LOOK SHE GAVE HIM CHECKED THE DEPRECIATION ON HIS LIPS OH WHY DID YOU BRING ME OUT HERE ONE OUGHT TO CREEP AWAY AND SIT IN THE DARK TILL IT BEGINS AGAIN
THE DAY WAS WARM THE THEATRE CROWDED AND AIRLESS AND THE PERFORMANCE IT SEEMED TO HIM INTOLERABLY BAD
BUT WHAT WOULD IMPEL OR RESTRAIN HIM AT THE CRUCIAL HOUR SHE PUT NO FAITH IN HER OWN ARTS SHE WAS TOO SURE OF HAVING NONE AND IF SOME BENEFICENT ENCHANTER HAD BESTOWED THEM ON HER SHE KNEW NOW THAT SHE WOULD HAVE REJECTED THE GIFT
HER CHIN ON HER HANDS WHAT RUBBISH WE TALK ABOUT INTENTIONS THE TRUTH IS I HADN'T ANY I JUST LIKED BEING WITH YOU PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW EXTRAORDINARILY ONE CAN LIKE BEING WITH YOU I WAS DEPRESSED AND ADRIFT MYSELF AND YOU MADE ME FORGET MY BOTHERS
HER RAPT PROFILE BETRAYED NO UNREST
HIS GESTURE BRUSHED ASIDE THE ALLUSION MONEY MAY BE THE ROOT OF THE MATTER IT CAN'T BE THE WHOLE OF IT BETWEEN FRIENDS DON'T YOU THINK ONE FRIEND MAY ACCEPT A SMALL SERVICE FROM ANOTHER WITHOUT LOOKING TOO FAR AHEAD OR WEIGHING TOO MANY CHANCES
FOR THE SAME SPACE OF TIME THE PAST SURGED UP IN HIM CONFUSEDLY THEN A VEIL DROPPED BETWEEN THEM HERE'S EFFIE NOW SHE EXCLAIMED HE TURNED AND SAW THE LITTLE GIRL TROTTING BACK TO THEM HER HAND IN OWEN LEATH'S
YES FROM GIRLS WHO'VE ONLY GOT TO CHOOSE HER EYES HAD GROWN SUDDENLY ALMOST OLD I'D LIKE YOU TO SEE THE ONLY MEN WHO'VE EVER WANTED TO MARRY ME
BUT HER LOOK OF SYMPATHY HAD DISARMED HIM HIS HEART WAS BITTER AND DISTRACTED SHE WAS NEAR HIM HER EYES WERE SHINING WITH COMPASSION HE BENT OVER HER AND KISSED HER HAND FORGIVE ME DO FORGIVE ME HE SAID
IT SEEMS TO ME A GREAT DEAL IT'S WHAT SHE'D ALREADY ASKED ME HIS VOICE SHOWED HER HOW DEEPLY HE WAS MOVED AND A THROB OF JEALOUSY SHOT THROUGH HER OH IT WAS FOR YOUR SAKE I KNOW HE MADE NO ANSWER AND SHE ADDED
THE SIGHT OF HIM SO TRANQUILLY ABSORBED IN THIS TRIFLING BUSINESS SEEMED TO GIVE TO THE QUIET ROOM A PERFUME OF INTIMACY TO FILL IT WITH A SENSE OF SWEET FAMILIAR HABIT AND IT CAME OVER HER AGAIN
DARROW ACQUIESCED AND THEY GOT OUT AND SENT EFFIE ON IN THE MOTOR THEIR WAY LED THROUGH A BIT OF SOBER FRENCH WOODLAND FLAT AS A FADED TAPESTRY BUT WITH GLEAMS OF LIVE EMERALD LINGERING HERE AND THERE AMONG ITS BROWNS AND OCHRES
IN THE RECOGNIZED ESSENTIALS HE HAD ALWAYS REMAINED STRICTLY WITHIN THE LIMIT OF HIS SCRUPLES FROM THIS REASSURING SURVEY OF HIS CASE
SHE ASKED LEANING OVER THE TABLE TO POUR HERSELF A SECOND CUP OF TEA HE LIKED HER QUICKNESS AT ANY RATE IT'S BETTER HE LAUGHED THAN YOUR THINKING I CAME FOR MISSUS MURRETT
ONCE AT THE TURN OF A WALL THEY STOPPED THE MOTOR BEFORE A RUINED GATEWAY AND STUMBLING ALONG A ROAD FULL OF RUTS STOOD BEFORE A LITTLE OLD DESERTED HOUSE FANTASTICALLY CARVED AND CHIMNEYED WHICH LAY IN A MOAT UNDER THE SHADE OF ANCIENT TREES
SHE HAD GIVEN HIM ON THE DAY OF HIS ARRIVAL
YOU DON'T AT ANY RATE KNOW ANYTHING SPECIFIC TO THE CONTRARY TO THE CONTRARY HOW SHOULD I
THE INTERVENING HOURS HAD BEEN DISPOSED OF IN A STROLL THROUGH THE LIVELY STREETS AND A REPAST LUXURIOUSLY LINGERED OVER
ALL THE DIFFERENCE HE WAS A LITTLE TIRED OF EXPERIMENTING ON LIFE HE WANTED TO TAKE A LINE TO FOLLOW THINGS UP TO CENTRALIZE AND CONCENTRATE AND PRODUCE RESULTS TWO OR THREE MORE YEARS OF DIPLOMACY WITH HER BESIDE HIM
THE HAIR STOOD UP FROM HER FOREHEAD IN A BOYISH ELF LOCK
AND THERE'S NO EARTHLY USE IN SITTING HERE WAITING SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM IN PERPLEXITY BUT WHEN I WROTE YESTERDAY I ASKED THEM TO TELEGRAPH I SUPPOSE THEY'RE HORRIBLY HARD UP THE POOR DEARS
MADAME DE CHANTELLE HAD BROKEN HER WOODEN EMBROIDERY FRAME AND DARROW HAVING OFFERED TO REPAIR IT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR UP TO A TABLE THAT HELD A LAMP ANNA WATCHED HIM AS HE SAT WITH BENT HEAD AND KNITTED BROWS TRYING TO FIT TOGETHER THE DISJOINED PIECES
AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT OTHER WOMAN HAS SAT AND WATCHED HIM AS I AM DOING SHE HAS KNOWN HIM AS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN HIM PERHAPS HE IS THINKING OF THAT NOW
IS THAT THE WAY THEY MADE YOU FEEL DIDN'T THEY YOU AS IF THE GODS WERE THERE ALL THE WHILE JUST BEHIND THEM PULLING THE STRINGS HER HANDS WERE PRESSED AGAINST THE RAILING HER FACE SHINING AND DARKENING UNDER THE WING BEATS OF SUCCESSIVE IMPRESSIONS
DARROW HAD SAID YOU WERE MADE TO FEEL EVERYTHING AND TO FEEL WAS SURELY BETTER THAN TO JUDGE WHEN SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS HE WAS ALREADY IN THE OAK ROOM WITH EFFIE AND MADAME DE CHANTELLE
LOOK THERE ARE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT
HE LOOKED YOUNG ACTIVE STORED WITH STRENGTH AND ENERGY NOT THE MAN FOR VAIN REPININGS OR LONG MEMORIES SHE WONDERED WHAT SHE HAD TO HOLD OR SATISFY HIM HE LOVED HER NOW SHE HAD NO DOUBT OF THAT BUT HOW COULD SHE HOPE TO KEEP HIM
SHE COULD ALMOST HAVE SMILED AT HER SCRUPLES OF THE NIGHT BEFORE AS SHE LOOKED BACK ON THEM THEY SEEMED TO BELONG TO THE OLD IGNORANT TIMOROUS TIME WHEN SHE HAD FEARED TO LOOK LIFE IN THE FACE AND HAD BEEN BLIND TO THE MYSTERIES AND CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART BECAUSE HER OWN HAD NOT BEEN REVEALED TO HER
HE FELT HER YIELD SLIGHTLY TO HIS CLASP AND HURRIED ON WITHOUT GIVING HER TIME TO ANSWER ISN'T IT A PITY TO SPOIL OUR GOOD TIME TOGETHER BY REGRETTING ANYTHING YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREVENT OUR HAVING IT SHE DREW BACK FREEING HER HANDS HER FACE
AND HE WALKED ON IN SILENCE AT MISS VINER'S SIDE PRESENTLY HE WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT OWEN LEATH AND THE GIRL WERE SILENT ALSO AND THIS GAVE A NEW TURN TO HIS THOUGHTS SILENCE MAY BE AS VARIOUSLY SHADED AS SPEECH
AND THAT WHICH ENFOLDED DARROW AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS SEEMED TO HIS WATCHFUL PERCEPTIONS TO BE QUIVERING WITH CROSS THREADS OF COMMUNICATION AT FIRST HE WAS AWARE ONLY OF THOSE THAT CENTRED IN HIS OWN TROUBLED CONSCIOUSNESS
AND STOOD UP AND LOOKED DOWN ON HIM SMILING FAINTLY HE SAT STILL ABSORBING THE LOOK AND THINKING THERE'LL BE EVENINGS AND EVENINGS TILL SHE CAME NEARER BENT OVER HIM
HER LONG RESIDENCE ON GALLIC SOIL HAD NOT MITIGATED HER HOSTILITY TOWARD THE CREED AND CUSTOMS OF THE RACE BUT THOUGH SHE ALWAYS REFERRED TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS THE SCARLET WOMAN AND TOOK THE DARKEST VIEWS OF FRENCH PRIVATE LIFE
ONE LOOKS IN ONE'S GLASS AFTER ALL
SHE BROODED A MOMENT BEHIND DROOPED LIDS THEN WITH A TOUCH OF HAUTEUR I'M GOING TO PARIS TO STUDY FOR THE STAGE THE STAGE DARROW STARED AT HER DISMAYED ALL HIS CONFUSED CONTRADICTORY IMPRESSIONS ASSUMED A NEW ASPECT
SEEN IN THIS LIGHT THE PLAY REGAINED FOR DARROW ITS SUPREME AND POIGNANT REALITY HE PIERCED TO THE HEART OF ITS SIGNIFICANCE THROUGH ALL THE ARTIFICIAL ACCRETIONS WITH WHICH HIS THEORIES OF ART AND THE CONVENTIONS OF THE STAGE HAD CLOTHED IT AND SAW IT AS HE HAD NEVER SEEN IT
AS LIFE AFTER THIS THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF FLIGHT AND HE TOOK HER BACK TO THE THEATRE CONTENT TO RECEIVE HIS OWN SENSATIONS THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF HERS BUT WITH THE CONTINUATION OF THE PLAY AND THE OPPRESSION OF THE HEAVY AIR HIS ATTENTION AGAIN BEGAN TO WANDER
NOW WITH A PAIR OF THEM LOOKING INTO HIS
I WALKED MILES AND MILES WITH NURSE AND COULDN'T FIND YOU AND WE MET JEAN AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU'D GONE NOBODY KNOWS WHERE I GO OR WHAT I SEE WHEN I GET THERE THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT HE LAUGHED BACK AT HER BUT IF YOU'RE GOOD HE ADDED
AND SO WOULD THE TIGER MEANWHILE SUCH EXPERTNESS QUALIFIED BY SUCH CANDOUR MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS THE EXTENT OF HER PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OR TO ESTIMATE ITS EFFECT ON HER CHARACTER SHE MIGHT BE ANY ONE OF A DOZEN DEFINABLE TYPES OR SHE MIGHT
WHAT ABOUT ME WELL WHETHER IT WAS YOU OR SHE WHO HE WINCED BUT HID HIS DISAPPROVAL IT MADE THE TIME PASS TO LISTEN TO HER AND WHAT IF ONE MAY ASK WAS YOUR CONCLUSION
AND THAT THEREFORE IT WAS OF NO MOMENT WHETHER SHE RECEIVED THE FARLOWS ANSWER THEN OR A FEW HOURS LATER BUT FOR SOME REASON HE HESITATED TO USE THIS ARGUMENT WHICH HAD COME SO NATURALLY TO HIM THE DAY BEFORE
YOU'LL TELL ME ABOUT THAT THEN WON'T YOU HER SMILE FLICKERED UP OH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IT SOON I MUST CATCH EFFIE NOW AND DRAG HER BACK TO THE BLACKBOARD
HER STEADY GAZE WHEN HE SPOKE THE GRAVE FREEDOM OF HER GAIT AND GESTURES HE RECALLED EVERY DETAIL OF HER FACE
AND INSTEAD OF ANSWERING HIM SHE BROKE OUT THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN WANTING YOU TO KNOW THE OTHER DAY IN PARIS I SAW MISS VINER SHE SAW HIM FLUSH WITH THE INTENSITY OF HIS SURPRISE YOU SENT FOR HER
ALL THESE THINGS CAME BACK TO HIM AS HE SAT BESIDE HER IN THE THEATRE AND WATCHED HER INGENUOUS ABSORPTION IT WAS ON THE STORY THAT HER MIND WAS FIXED AND IN LIFE ALSO HE SUSPECTED
MINGLED WITH THESE SENSATIONS WERE CONSIDERATIONS OF ANOTHER ORDER HE REFLECTED WITH SATISFACTION THAT SHE WAS THE KIND OF WOMAN WITH WHOM ONE WOULD LIKE TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC
DEEPER STILL THAN ALL THESE SATISFACTIONS WAS THE MERE ELEMENTAL SENSE OF WELL BEING IN HER PRESENCE THAT AFTER ALL
BUT INSTEAD OF TAKING THE WAY HE PROPOSED SHE TURNED TOWARD A NARROW PATH WHICH BRANCHED OFF OBLIQUELY THROUGH THE TREES DARROW WAS STRUCK AND VAGUELY TROUBLED BY THE CHANGE IN HER LOOK AND TONE
SHE NO LONGER EVEN KNEW WHAT SHE HAD MEANT TO SAY THE SAME EXPERIENCE REPEATED ITSELF SEVERAL TIMES THAT DAY AND THE NEXT
BUT OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER ME SHE WAS SAYING MY NAME IS VINER SOPHY VINER
HE FELT LIKE ANSWERING
IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING A TELEGRAM HAD COME FROM OWEN LEATH
CLOTHES AND FUN AND MOTORS AND ADMIRATION AND YACHTING AND PARIS WHY PARIS ALONE WOULD BE ENOUGH
I'M AWFULLY MODERN YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST WHEN SHE PROCLAIMED HERSELF MOST AWFULLY MODERN THAT SHE STRUCK HIM AS MOST HELPLESSLY BACKWARD YET THE MOMENT AFTER
AND BECAUSE I COULDN'T BEAR TO HAVE YOU GO HE HAD THE FEELING THAT THE WORDS WERE BEING UTTERED IN SPITE OF HIM BY SOME MALICIOUS WITNESS OF THE SCENE AND YET THAT HE WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE THEM SPOKEN THE GIRL HAD LISTENED TO HIM IN SILENCE
SHE BROKE OFF CONFUSED AND HE QUESTIONED WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW BETTER THE COLOUR ROSE TO HER FOREHEAD HOW COULD SHE TELL HIM WHAT SHE SCARCELY DARED OWN TO HERSELF
AND VEILED THE DISTANT GLIMPSES OF THE LANDSCAPE IN SOFT UNCERTAINTY IN SUCH A SOLITUDE ANNA HAD FANCIED IT WOULD BE EASIER TO SPEAK BUT AS SHE WALKED BESIDE DARROW OVER THE DEEP SOUNDLESS FLOORING OF BROWN MOSS THE WORDS ON HER LIPS TOOK FLIGHT AGAIN
WELL THEN IF SOUTH BRAINTREE VOUCHES FOR MISS VINER OH BUT ONLY INDIRECTLY
THE GESTURE HAD ACTED ON DARROW'S NUMB FEELINGS AS THE GLOW OF THE FIRE ACTED ON HIS CIRCULATION AND WHEN HE HAD ASKED AREN'T YOUR FEET WET TOO AND AFTER FRANK INSPECTION OF A STOUT SHOD SOLE SHE HAD ANSWERED CHEERFULLY
IF I'D EVER CARED A STRAW FOR HER I SHOULD KNOW HOW TO AVOID HURTING HER NOW AND HIS INSENSIBILITY STRUCK HIM AS NO BETTER THAN A VULGAR OBTUSENESS BUT HE HAD A FIXED PURPOSE AHEAD AND COULD ONLY PUSH ON TO IT
HE FELT THE JOY OF A CONVALESCENT SUDDENLY WAKING TO FIND THE SUNLIGHT ON HIS FACE MADAME DE CHANTELLE ACROSS HER KNITTING DISCOURSED OF THEIR AFTERNOON'S EXCURSION WITH OCCASIONAL PAUSES INDUCED BY THE HYPNOTIC EFFECT OF THE FRESH AIR
EVER SINCE THE RAPID SELF COLLOQUY WHICH HAD FOLLOWED ON HIS FIRST SIGHT OF SOPHY VINER HE HAD KNOWN THERE WERE OTHER QUESTIONS TO BE FACED BEHIND THE ONE IMMEDIATELY CONFRONTING HIM ON THE SCORE OF THAT ONE AT LEAST HIS MIND IF NOT EASY WAS RELIEVED
IT'S NOT INDEED REAL COMPASSION PROMPTED HIM TO CONTINUE HAVE YOU ANY ANY INFLUENCE YOU CAN COUNT ON SHE GAVE A SOMEWHAT FLIPPANT LITTLE LAUGH NONE BUT MY OWN I'VE NEVER HAD ANY OTHER TO COUNT ON
BORED SHE MADE A LITTLE AGGRIEVED GRIMACE YOU MEAN YOU THOUGHT ME TOO IGNORANT AND STUPID TO APPRECIATE IT NO NOT THAT
TO PERSUADE HER TO DRIVE DIRECTLY TO THE BOIS FOR DINNER
AND THE GIRLISH THINNESS OF HER NECK ABOVE THE SLIGHT SWELL OF THE BREAST HIS IMAGINATION WAS STRUCK BY THE QUALITY OF RETICENCE IN HER BEAUTY
WHAT THEN ARE YOUR REASONS IF YOU PLEASE I'VE ALREADY IMPLIED THEM IN ADVISING YOU NOT TO GIVE UP ALL IDEA OF THE THEATRE YOU'RE TOO VARIOUS TOO GIFTED TOO PERSONAL TO TIE YOURSELF DOWN AT YOUR AGE
FINALLY DREW HIM TO HIS FEET FROM HER WRITING TABLE WHERE SHE SAT OVER A PILE OF LETTERS ANNA LIFTED HER HAPPY SMILE THE IMPULSE TO PRESS HIS LIPS TO IT MADE HIM COME CLOSE AND DRAW HER UPWARD SHE THREW HER HEAD BACK
AND SO FAR I'VE HAD NO CAUSE TO REGRET MY CHOICE BUT I KNOW AFTER ALL VERY LITTLE ABOUT MISS VINER AND THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF REASONS WHY I WANT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO FIND OUT MORE TO FIND OUT ALL I CAN
AND YOU'LL GIVE ME A CHANCE TO TALK THINGS OVER WITH YOU SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH A FAINT SMILE I'M NOT THINKING OF THE STAGE I'VE HAD ANOTHER OFFER THAT'S ALL THE RELIEF WAS HARDLY LESS GREAT
HE PASSED OVER THE OBVIOUS REPLY BUT HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW THE PROFESSION IS OVER CROWDED I KNOW I'M TRITE I'VE A VERY CLEAR IDEA BUT I COULDN'T GO ON AS I WAS
THE CHANCE OF ANOTHER AND CALMER TALK AND HE RESOLVED TO SEEK IT AT THE EARLIEST HOUR HE HAD GATHERED THAT EFFIE'S LESSONS WERE PRECEDED BY AN EARLY SCAMPER IN THE PARK
YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU THINK I'M SPITEFUL AND ENVIOUS YES I WAS ENVIOUS OF LADY ULRICA OH
SHE WALKED ON FOR A FEW YARDS AND THEN PAUSED AGAIN AND CONFRONTED HIM I'VE BEEN ODIOUS TO YOU AND NOT QUITE HONEST SHE BROKE OUT SUDDENLY NOT QUITE HONEST HE REPEATED CAUGHT IN A FRESH WAVE OF WONDER
SHE THOUGHT WITH A PANG OF BITTERNESS HE WON'T GROW ANY OLDER BECAUSE HE DOESN'T FEEL THINGS AND BECAUSE HE DOESN'T I SHALL AND WHEN SHE CEASED TO PLEASE HIM WHAT THEN HAD HE THE TRADITION OF FAITH TO THE SPOKEN VOW
BUT THE WISH ISN'T DUE TO TO ANY PAST KINDNESS ON YOUR PART BUT SIMPLY TO MY OWN INTEREST IN YOU WHY NOT PUT IT THAT OUR FRIENDSHIP GIVES ME THE RIGHT TO INTERVENE FOR WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE YOUR BENEFIT
THE OLD DELUSION I SUPPOSE
I USED TO PASS YOU ON THE STAIRS SHE REMINDED HIM YES
I SHA'N'T BE EFFIE'S GOVERNESS MUCH LONGER AT THE ANNOUNCEMENT DARROW TRIED TO MERGE HIS LOOK OF RELIEF INTO THE EXPRESSION OF FRIENDLY INTEREST WITH WHICH HE GRASPED HER HAND YOU REALLY DO AGREE WITH ME THEN
HE REMAINED IMPERTURBABLY GOOD HUMOURED AND APPRECIATIVE WHILE THEY WENT THE ROUND OF THE MONUMENT AND SHE REMARKED ONLY THAT WHEN HE THOUGHT HIMSELF UNNOTICED HIS FACE GREW GRAVE AND HIS ANSWERS CAME LESS PROMPTLY
AND THE SECOND EVENING WITH THE AMIABLY IMPLIED INTENTION OF LEAVING ANNA AND DARROW TO THEMSELVES SHE TOOK AN EARLIER LEAVE OF THEM THAN USUAL ANNA SAT SILENT LISTENING TO HER SMALL STIFF STEPS AS THEY MINCED DOWN THE HALL AND DIED OUT IN THE DISTANCE
RETURNED HIS GREETING ALMOST GAILY HIS FIRST GLANCE SHOWED HIM THAT SHE HAD REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND THE CHANGE IN HER APPEARANCE GAVE HIM THE MEASURE OF HER FEARS FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SAW IN HER AGAIN THE SIDELONG GRACE THAT HAD CHARMED HIS EYES IN PARIS
OH ON THAT SCORE I'M AFRAID I SHA'N'T BE OF MUCH USE
INTENTIONS HE STOOD UP WALKED THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM AND TURNED BACK TO WHERE SHE STILL SAT MOTIONLESS
HIS LIFE ON THE WHOLE HAD BEEN A CREDITABLE AFFAIR OUT OF MODEST CHANCES AND MIDDLING TALENTS HE HAD BUILT HIMSELF A FAIRLY MARKED PERSONALITY KNOWN SOME EXCEPTIONAL PEOPLE
UNLOCKED HIS OWN DOOR AND GLANCED AT THE EMPTY TABLE
THE APPLICATION OF THE SAME METHOD TO THE SUBJECT OF OWEN'S FUTURE HIS GRANDMOTHER HAVING NO SUSPICION OF THE REAL REASON OF SOPHY VINER'S DEPARTURE HAD THOUGHT IT EXTREMELY SUITABLE OF THE YOUNG GIRL TO WITHDRAW TO THE SHELTER OF HER OLD FRIENDS ROOF IN THE HOUR OF BRIDAL PREPARATION
IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK THE SPELL OF QUIET JOY WHICH HIS PRESENCE LAID ON HER AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO TALK OF THE PLACE THEY HAD JUST VISITED SHE ANSWERED HIS QUESTIONS AND THEN WAITED FOR WHAT HE SHOULD SAY NEXT NO DECIDEDLY SHE COULD NOT SPEAK
MORE MINDFUL OF THE INFLECTIONS OF HIS VOICE THAN OF WHAT HE WAS ACTUALLY SAYING WHY ON EARTH SHOULD WE SAY GOOD BYE IF WE'RE BOTH SORRY TO
BUT IS THERE IN SUCH A CASE ANY RECOMMENDATION WORTH HALF AS MUCH AS YOUR OWN DIRECT EXPERIENCE
FOR AT A CERTAIN POINT HER IMAGINATION ALWAYS TURNED BACK BUT IF IT WERE A MERE LINK IN A CHAIN OF SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS THE THOUGHT OF IT DISHONOURED HER WHOLE PAST EFFIE IN THE INTERREGNUM BETWEEN GOVERNESSES HAD BEEN GIVEN LEAVE TO DINE DOWNSTAIRS
HE DREW UP A CHAIR AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HER AFTER ALL HE SAID IN A TONE OF GOOD HUMOURED PROTEST
IS THIS IT DARROW ASKED PICKING UP A BOOK FROM THE TABLE OH THANK YOU
TO EASE IT HE MADE AN ABRUPT DASH AT THE TRUTH I CAME OUT TO LOOK FOR YOU BECAUSE OUR TALK OF YESTERDAY WAS SO UNSATISFACTORY I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT YOU ABOUT YOUR PLANS AND PROSPECTS
EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON THEY HAD GONE OUT IN THE MOTOR TRAVERSING MILES OF SOBER TINTED LANDSCAPE IN WHICH HERE AND THERE
THIS MAIDENLY RETREAT HAD IN FACT IMPRESSED MADAME DE CHANTELLE SO FAVOURABLY THAT SHE WAS DISPOSED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO TALK OVER OWEN'S PROJECTS AND AS EVERY HUMAN EVENT TRANSLATED ITSELF FOR HER INTO TERMS OF SOCIAL AND DOMESTIC DETAIL
WHO WAS THERE IN YOUR TIME MISSUS BOLT AND MADEMOISELLE AND PROFESSOR DIDYMUS AND THE POLISH COUNTESS
ON HIS MEAGRE MEMORY OF THEIR ADVENTURE THE ESSENTIAL CHEAPNESS OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR AS FAR AS HIS SHARE IN IT WAS CONCERNED CAME HOME TO HIM WITH HUMILIATING DISTINCTNESS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE ABLE TO FEEL THAT AT THE TIME AT LEAST
HE DREW HER TO HIM WITH A SMILE ON THAT CONDITION I'M PREPARED TO LOVE EVEN ADELAIDE PAINTER I ALMOST HOPE YOU WONT HAVE THE CHANCE TO POOR ADELAIDE HER APPEARANCE HERE ALWAYS COINCIDES WITH A CATASTROPHE OH THEN I MUST MANAGE TO MEET HER ELSEWHERE
SHE THREW OFF THE STATEMENT WITHOUT IMPATIENCE AS THOUGH THEY WERE DISCUSSING TOGETHER THE FATE OF A THIRD PERSON IN WHOM BOTH WERE BENEVOLENTLY INTERESTED DARROW CONSIDERED HIS REPLY IF I DID
WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU'LL ONLY LET ME SHE RAISED A HAND AS THOUGH TO CHECK HIM IT'S EXTREMELY FRIENDLY OF YOU I DO BELIEVE YOU MEAN IT AS A FRIEND BUT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY FINDING ME AS YOU SAY
SHE LAID THE CASE BEFORE HIM WITH A COLD LUCIDITY I SHOULD IN YOUR PLACE I BELIEVE SHE ENDED WITH A LITTLE LAUGH I SHOULDN'T FEEL JUSTIFIED IN TELLING HER BEHIND YOUR BACK IF I THOUGHT YOU UNSUITED FOR THE PLACE
I'VE TOLD HER EXACTLY NOTHING HE REPLIED AND WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN BY NOTHING YOU AND SHE WERE TALKING ABOUT ME WHEN I CAME INTO HER SITTING ROOM YESTERDAY DARROW FELT HIS BLOOD RISE AT THE THRUST
HER QUESTIONS TESTIFIED TO A WHOLESOME AND COMPREHENSIVE HUMAN CURIOSITY AND HER COMMENTS SHOWED LIKE HER FACE AND HER WHOLE ATTITUDE AN ODD MINGLING OF PRECOCIOUS WISDOM AND DISARMING IGNORANCE WHEN SHE TALKED TO HIM ABOUT LIFE
HIS GAZE ROAMED PEACEFULLY ABOUT THE QUIET ROOM
WAS ONCE FOR ALL TO TURN BACK WITH HIM TO ITS CONTEMPLATION AS SOON AS THIS DESIRE HAD GERMINATED
SHE THREW THE WORDS OFF WITH A HALF IRONIC SMILE
ACCUSED HER OF HYPNOTIZING THE PROFESSOR BUT OF COURSE YOU DON'T REMEMBER WE WERE ALL INVISIBLE TO YOU BUT WE COULD SEE AND WE ALL USED TO WONDER ABOUT YOU
EVERY APPARENT REASON WE ALL LIKE HER EFFIE'S VERY FOND OF HER AND SHE SEEMS TO HAVE A DELIGHTFUL INFLUENCE ON THE CHILD BUT WE KNOW SO LITTLE AFTER ALL ABOUT HER ANTECEDENTS I MEAN AND HER PAST HISTORY
THROUGH WHICH HIS LOOKS HIS WORDS HIS TOUCH REACHED HER AS THROUGH A MIST OF BODILY PAIN YET THIS INERTIA WAS TORN BY WILD FLASHES OF RESISTANCE AND WHEN THEY WERE APART SHE BEGAN TO PREPARE AGAIN WHAT SHE MEANT TO SAY TO HIM
AH SAID OWEN ABRUPTLY SETTING DOWN HIS CUP HE STOOD UP LIT ANOTHER CIGARETTE AND WANDERED AWAY TO THE PIANO IN THE ROOM BEYOND
AND THE SENSE OF REASSURANCE WHICH HIS PRESENCE GAVE HER WAS MERGED IN THE RELIEF OF NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK OF WHAT WAS BETWEEN THEM BUT THERE IT WAS INEVITABLY AND WHENEVER THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER THEY SAW IT IN HER DREAD OF GIVING IT A MORE TANGIBLE SHAPE
THANK YOU THANK YOU MOST AWFULLY FOR TELLING ME AND FOR ALL YOUR OTHER KIND INTENTIONS THE PLAN'S DELIGHTFUL REALLY QUITE DELIGHTFUL AND I'M EXTREMELY FLATTERED AND OBLIGED
DARROW AND SOPHY MOUNTED TOGETHER IN THE LIFT AND THE YOUNG MAN
ALL HE HAD EVER MEANT TO DO WAS TO GIVE HER A CHILD'S HOLIDAY TO LOOK BACK TO FOR A MOMENT HE FANCIED SHE WAS CRYING
AND THEY GAVE EACH OTHER A LONG KISS OF PROMISE AND COMMUNION THE MEMORY OF IT GLOWED IN HIM STILL AS HE SAT OVER HIS CRUMBLING FIRE BUT BENEATH HIS PHYSICAL EXULTATION HE FELT A CERTAIN GRAVITY OF MOOD
