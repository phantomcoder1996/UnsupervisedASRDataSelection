THE ADVENTURE OF THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY
TWO ANCIENT LADIES WERE SEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE ALREADY VERY GRAND LOOKING DAMES WITH THE HAUGHTY AND EXCLUSIVE UGLINESS OF THE ENGLISH ARISTOCRACY IN ITS LATER STAGES
I FIND IT THE MOST FASCINATING CAPITAL IN EUROPE WHAT GAIETY WHAT MOVEMENT WHAT POETRY WHAT MYSTERY IF MYSTERY MEANS FOG IT CHALLENGES THE WORLD I INTERPOSED HE GAZED AT ME WITH FIXED EYES
TO SCHLANGENBAD YOU COULD GET A TEMPORARY MAID HER FRIEND SUGGESTED IN A LULL OF THE TORNADO THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY FLARED UP YES AND HAVE MY JEWEL CASE STOLEN
BY MONDAY I HAD PAPERED AND FURNISHED THE ROOMS AND WAS READY TO START ON MY VOYAGE OF EXPLORATION I MET THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY AT CHARING CROSS BY APPOINTMENT AND PROCEEDED TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER LUGGAGE AND TICKETS
WITHOUT A FRIEND TO PROTECT A RELATION TO COUNSEL HER I DON'T COUNT AUNT SUSAN WHO LURKED IN LADYLIKE INDIGENCE AT BLACKHEATH AND WHOSE COUNSEL LIKE HER TRACTS WAS GIVEN AWAY TOO PROFUSELY TO EVERYBODY
I START ON MONDAY I GLANCED AT HER CARD THE VERY COPPERPLATE WAS NOISY LADY GEORGINA FAWLEY FORTY NINE FORTESCUE CRESCENT W IT HAD TAKEN US TWENTY MINUTES TO ARRANGE OUR PROTOCOLS
THEN SHE SCANNED ME UP AND DOWN AS IF I WERE A GIRL IN A MANTLE SHOP AND SHE CONTEMPLATED BUYING EITHER ME OR THE MANTLE AT LAST CATCHING MY EYE SHE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND BURST OUT LAUGHING
THIS IS MY JEWEL BOX IT CONTAINS ALL THAT REMAINS OF THE FAWLEY FAMILY JEWELS I POSITIVELY DECLINE TO APPEAR AT SCHLANGENBAD WITHOUT A DIAMOND TO MY BACK THIS NEVER LEAVES MY HANDS
NATURE DID NOT CUT ME OUT FOR A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I COULDN'T SWALLOW A POKER IF I TRIED FOR WEEKS POKERS DON'T AGREE WITH ME BETWEEN OURSELVES I AM A BIT OF A REBEL YOU ARE BROWNIE SHE ANSWERED
YOU NEVER WILL LEARN WHAT I MEAN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE NO NO I AM GOING OUT SIMPLY IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE WHAT ADVENTURE MAY COME I HAVE NOT AT THIS MOMENT THE FAINTEST CONCEPTION
THOSE LITTLE LIPS COULD NEVER FRAME THEMSELVES TO SCHLECHT OR WUNDERSCHOEN THEY WERE NOT CUT OUT FOR IT PARDON ME I ANSWERED IN GERMAN WHAT I SAY THAT I MEAN THE NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN MUSIC OF THE FATHERLAND'S SPEECH
SHE HAD FLAYED ALIVE THE GREATER PART OF LONDON SOCIETY WITH KEEN WIT AND SPRIGHTLINESS I LAUGHED AGAINST MY WILL AT HER ILL TEMPERED SALLIES THEY WERE TOO FUNNY NOT TO AMUSE IN SPITE OF THEIR VITRIOL AS FOR THE COUNT
AND WHEN LADY GEORGINA'S SALLOW CHEEKS BEGAN TO GROW PALE I WAS STEADY ENOUGH TO SUPPLY HER WITH HER SHAWL AND HER SMELLING BOTTLE SHE FIDGETED AND WORRIED THE WHOLE WAY OVER SHE WOULD BE TREATED LIKE A VERTEBRATE ANIMAL
WE SHALL HAVE TO TAKE IT DOWN AGAIN I DEVISE A PLAN THEREFORE I SUBMIT MYSELF TO FATE OR IF YOU PREFER IT I LEAVE MY FUTURE IN THE HANDS OF PROVIDENCE I SHALL STROLL OUT THIS MORNING
MY PARENTS CHOSE TO INFLICT UPON ME THE MOST ODIOUS LABEL THAT HUMAN INGENUITY EVER DEVISED FOR A CHRISTIAN SOUL AND I'VE NOT HAD COURAGE ENOUGH TO BURST OUT AND CHANGE IT A GLEAM OF INTUITION FLASHED ACROSS ME
IF MY EYES HAD BEEN LIKE ELSIE'S THAT LIQUID BLUE WHICH LOOKS OUT UPON LIFE WITH MINGLED PITY AND AMAZEMENT I MIGHT HAVE FELT AS A GIRL OUGHT TO FEEL UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS BUT HAVING LARGE DARK EYES WITH A BIT OF A TWINKLE IN THEM
FOR A MORE INSOLENT UPSTANDING INDEPENDENT ANSWER YOU BACK AGAIN YOUNG WOMAN WITH A SNEER OF HER OWN I NEVER SAW AMELIA BUT I MUST GET TO SCHLANGENBAD NOW THERE THE DIFFICULTY COMES IN ON THE ONE HAND
A COLD DRAUGHT RUNS SO OFTEN ALONG THE FLOOR IN RAILWAY CARRIAGES THIS IS KENT THAT WE TRAVERSE AH THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND AS A DIPLOMAT HE KNEW EVERY NOOK OF EUROPE AND HE ECHOED THE MOT HE HAD ACCIDENTALLY HEARD DROP FROM MADAME'S LIPS ON THE PLATFORM
I PUT MY FOOT DOWN THERE I WILL NOT TAKE ANY TEMPORARY PERSON I SAW MY CHANCE THIS WAS A DELIGHTFUL IDEA WHY NOT START FOR SCHLANGENBAD WITH THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY
SHE HAS AN AWFUL TEMPER THAT'S NOTHING SO HAVE I APPALLING I ASSURE YOU AND IF IT COMES TO BLOWS I'M BIGGER AND YOUNGER AND STRONGER THAN SHE IS WELL I WISH YOU WELL OUT OF IT THANK YOU
TO ALLOW OF ONE'S PLACING ANY VERY HIGH VALUE UPON IT BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT I MUST ADMIT I WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ALARMED NATURE HAD ENDOWED ME WITH A PROFUSION OF CRISP BLACK HAIR AND PLENTY OF HIGH SPIRITS
AND HALF AN HOUR TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE AND SHE DROPPED ME A DEEP REVERENCE AND SHE ANSWERED OUI MADAME MERCI BEAUCOUP MADAME JE NE DESIRE PAS MIEUX MADAME AND OUT SHE FLOUNCED SO THERE WAS THE END OF IT
MAY PASS THE REST OF THEIR DAYS TOGETHER I HAD A LOVELY HARANGUE ALL PAT IN MY HEAD IN MUCH THE SAME STRAIN ON THE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES OF ENTERTAINING ANGELS UNAWARES IN CABS ON THE UNDERGROUND
I OWED HIM NOTHING EXCEPT MY POVERTY HE MARRIED MY DEAR MOTHER WHEN I WAS A GIRL AT SCHOOL IN SWITZERLAND AND HE PROCEEDED TO SPEND HER LITTLE FORTUNE LEFT AT HER SOLE DISPOSAL BY MY FATHER'S WILL IN PAYING HIS GAMBLING DEBTS
CLOSED A LITTLE MORE PARFAITEMENT THERE WAS A CURRENT OF AIR IL FAUT L'ADMETTRE MADAME WOULD PREFER THE CORNER NO THEN PERHAPS SHE WOULD LIKE THIS VALISE FOR A FOOTSTOOL PERMETTEZ JUST THUS
SO I ACCEPTED MY PLIGHT AS AN AMUSING EXPERIENCE AFFORDING FULL SCOPE FOR THE CONGENIAL EXERCISE OF COURAGE AND INGENUITY HOW BOUNDLESS ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF KENSINGTON GARDENS THE ROUND POND
OH THAT PLACID OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE EPISCOPAL GAITERS WAS THEIR FATHER WAS HE WELL A BISHOP SHOULD BRING UP HIS DAUGHTERS BETTER HAVING HIS CHILDREN IN SUBJECTION WITH ALL GRAVITY
AND BEING AS WELL ABLE TO PILOT A BICYCLE AS ANY GIRL OF MY ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE INHERITED OR ACQUIRED AN OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD WHICH DISTINCTLY LEANS RATHER TOWARDS CHEERINESS THAN DESPONDENCY I CROAK WITH DIFFICULTY
STILL YOU GO TO SCHLANGENBAD ON MONDAY THAT'S THE POINT ON MONDAY IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE JOURNEY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD ENOUGH TO BE RID OF THE MINX I'M GLAD AS IT IS INDEED
BUT ELSIE'S WIDENING EYES OF HORROR PULLED ME UP SHORT LIKE A HANSOM IN PICCADILLY WHEN THE INEXORABLE UPTURNED HAND OF THE POLICEMAN CHECKS IT OH BROWNIE
I THOUGHT THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY WHO WAS A SHREWD PERSON IN HER WAY MUST SURELY SEE THROUGH THIS OBVIOUS PATTER BUT I HAD UNDER ESTIMATED THE AVERAGE HUMAN CAPACITY FOR SWALLOWING FLATTERY
AFTER THAT HE CARRIED MY DEAR MOTHER OFF TO BURMA AND WHEN HE AND THE CLIMATE BETWEEN THEM HAD SUCCEEDED IN KILLING HER HE MADE UP FOR HIS APPROPRIATIONS AT THE CHEAPEST RATE BY ALLOWING ME JUST ENOUGH TO SEND ME TO GIRTON
I KISSED HER FLUFFY FOREHEAD YOU GOOD GENEROUS LITTLE ELSIE I CRIED I WON'T STOP HERE ONE MOMENT AFTER I HAVE FINISHED THE PAINTING AND PAPERING I CAME HERE TO HELP YOU
SHE WORE COFFEE COLOURED POINT LACE IN HER BONNET WITH A COMPLEXION TO MATCH BUT WHAT COULD I DO MY DEAR I SIMPLY COULDN'T PUT UP WITH SUCH INSOLENCE SO I LOOKED HER STRAIGHT BACK IN THE FACE OH SHE QUAILED I CAN TELL YOU
AND I SAID TO HER IN MY ICIEST VOICE YOU KNOW HOW ICY I CAN BE WHEN OCCASION DEMANDS IT' THE SECOND OLD LADY NODDED AN UNGRUDGING ASSENT AS IF PERFECTLY PREPARED TO ADMIT HER FRIEND'S RARE GIFT OF ICINESS
AND INSPECTED ME ALL OVER AGAIN WELL I DECLARE SHE MURMURED WHAT ARE GIRLS COMING TO I WONDER GIRTON YOU SAY GIRTON THAT PLACE AT CAMBRIDGE YOU SPEAK GREEK OF COURSE BUT HOW ABOUT GERMAN
I MUST HAVE SEEN YOU SOME YEARS AGO AT VIENNA MILADI
SHE ASKED I FLUSHED UP IN TURN THIS IS A PUBLIC PLACE I REPLIED WITH DIGNITY AND YOU SPOKE IN A TONE WHICH WAS HARDLY DESIGNED FOR THE STRICTEST PRIVACY
I HAVE HAD MY MOMENTS LADY GEORGINA MURMURED WITH HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE
SHE GREW PURPLE IN THE FACE WITH INDIGNATION AND ASTONISHMENT THAT A CASUAL OUTSIDER SHOULD VENTURE TO ADDRESS HER SO MUCH SO INDEED
DEAR LITTLE ELSIE WAS IN TRANSPORTS OF SURPRISE WHEN I RELATED MY ADVENTURE WILL YOU REALLY GO AND WHAT WILL YOU DO MY DEAR WHEN YOU GET THERE I HAVEN'T A NOTION I ANSWERED THAT'S WHERE THE FUN COMES IN BUT ANYHOW I SHALL HAVE GOT THERE
LOIS CAYLEY YOU SAY ANY RELATION OF A MADCAP CAPTAIN CAYLEY WHOM I USED ONCE TO KNOW IN THE FORTY SECOND HIGHLANDERS HIS DAUGHTER I ANSWERED FLUSHING
I AM TOLD I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY ALARMED AT THE STRAITS IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF A GIRL OF TWENTY ONE ALONE IN THE WORLD
WHEN WE'VE FINISHED THE PAPERING I COULDN'T TEACH TEACHING LIKE MAUVE IS THE REFUGE OF THE INCOMPETENT AND I DON'T IF POSSIBLE WANT TO SELL BONNETS AS A MILLINER'S GIRL
LADY GEORGINA RESISTED HIS INGENIOUS EFFORTS TO GAIN POSSESSION OF HER PRECIOUS JEWEL CASE AS SHE DESCENDED THE GANGWAY SHE CLUNG TO IT LIKE GRIM DEATH EVEN IN THE CHOPS OF THE CHANNEL FORTUNATELY I AM A GOOD SAILOR
DO I LOOK LIKE A WOMAN WHO CARES ABOUT A REFERENCE WHAT ARE CALLED CHARACTERS ARE USUALLY ESSAYS IN HOW NOT TO SAY IT YOU TAKE MY FANCY THAT'S THE POINT AND POOR TOM CAYLEY
NOT THE OBVIOUS BEAUTY OF MERE YOUTH AND HEALTH' HE GLANCED ACROSS AT ME DISDAINFULLY THE PROFOUNDER BEAUTY OF DEEP CHARACTER IN A FACE THAT CALM AND SERENE BEAUTY
HAS ON MY INFANT EAR FROM THE FIRST BEGINNING IMPRESSED ITSELF THE OLD LADY LAUGHED ALOUD DON'T JABBER IT TO ME CHILD SHE CRIED I HATE THE LINGO
WHAT WILL YOU DO TO FIND ONE PUT ON MY HAT AND WALK OUT I ANSWERED NOTHING COULD BE SIMPLER THIS CITY BURSTS WITH ENTERPRISES AND SURPRISES
CERTAINLY NOT MY CHILD I ANSWERED SHE WAS THREE YEARS OLDER THAN I SO I HAD THE RIGHT TO PATRONISE HER THAT WOULD SPOIL ALL YOUR DEAR LITTLE FACE WOULD BE QUITE ENOUGH TO SCARE AWAY A TIMID ADVENTURE
YES MADEMOISELLE
IT'S THE ONE TONGUE ON EARTH THAT EVEN A PRETTY GIRL'S LIPS FAIL TO RENDER ATTRACTIVE YOU YOURSELF MAKE FACES OVER IT WHAT'S YOUR NAME YOUNG WOMAN LOIS CAYLEY LOIS WHAT A NAME
OF COURSE I HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION OF TAKING A LADY'S MAID'S PLACE FOR A PERMANENCY NOR EVEN IF IT COMES TO THAT AS A PASSING EXPEDIENT BUT IF I WANTED TO GO ROUND THE WORLD
WELL WELL WE CAN SETTLE THIS LITTLE MATTER BETWEEN US MIND I'M A PERSON WHO ALWAYS EXPECTS TO HAVE MY OWN WAY IF YOU COME WITH ME TO SCHLANGENBAD YOU MUST DO AS I TELL YOU
I CUT OUT HALF HER CLOTHES FOR HER HER OWN IDEAS WERE ALMOST ENTIRELY LIMITED TO DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS AND CUTTING OUT A BLOUSE BY DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS IS WEARY UPHILL WORK FOR A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER
THE GIRL HAS SPIRIT SHE REMARKED IN AN ENCOURAGING TONE AS IF SHE WERE DISCUSSING SOME ABSENT PERSON UPON MY WORD AMELIA I RATHER LIKE THE LOOK OF HER WELL MY GOOD WOMAN
HE WAS A CHARMING MAN YOU READ HIS MASTERLY PAPER ON THE CENTRAL PROBLEM OF THE DUAL EMPIRE YOU WERE IN VIENNA THEN THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY MUSED BACK LOIS MY CHILD DON'T STARE'
THEY JUST GO TO THE PRIEST AND CONFESS YOU KNOW AND WIPE IT ALL OUT AND START FRESH AGAIN ON A CAREER OF CRIME NEXT MORNING I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHY I EVER GO ABROAD THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD FIT TO LIVE IN IS ENGLAND
THE BUCCANEERING MARINERS OF ELIZABETHAN DEVON I SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR AT THE FOOT OF AN OLD ELM WITH A POETIC HOLLOW PROSAICALLY FILLED BY A UTILITARIAN PLATE OF GALVANISED IRON
BECAUSE I SIMPLY DAREN'T UNDERTAKE TO CROSS THE CHANNEL ALONE AND GO ALL THAT LONG JOURNEY
AS SOON AS I'VE CLEANED MYSELF AND EMBRACE THE FIRST STRAY ENTERPRISE THAT OFFERS OUR BAGDAD TEEMS WITH ENCHANTED CARPETS LET ONE BUT FLOAT MY WAY AND HI PRESTO I SEIZE IT
I LAID DOWN THE PASTE BRUSH AND MUSED DO YOU REMEMBER ELSIE I SAID STARING HARD AT THE PAPER BOARD WHEN I FIRST WENT TO GIRTON HOW ALL YOU GIRLS WORE YOUR HAIR QUITE STRAIGHT IN NEAT SMOOTH COILS
THEY DON'T MAKE EM ANY LONGER IN ENGLAND I'M SURE LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THE TRADE IN RUSTIC INNOCENCE HAS BEEN DRIVEN FROM THE COUNTRY I CAN'T WAIT TO GET A GRETCHEN AS I SHOULD LIKE TO DO OF COURSE
NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD SO DELIGHTFUL AS ENGLAND MONSIEUR IS ATTACHED TO THE EMBASSY IN LONDON LADY GEORGINA INQUIRED GROWING AFFABLE HE TWIRLED HIS GREY MOUSTACHE A WAXED MOUSTACHE OF GREAT DISTINCTION
AS I WALKED OFF WELL PLEASED LADY GEORGINA'S FRIEND RAN AFTER ME QUICKLY YOU MUST TAKE CARE SHE SAID IN A WARNING VOICE YOU'VE CAUGHT A TARTAR SO I SUSPECT I ANSWERED
WELL YOU'LL DO I THINK SHE SAID CATCHING MY ARM THAT BIG MILL DOWN YONDER HASN'T GROUND THE ORIGINALITY ALTOGETHER OUT OF YOU
THOUGH IT LOOKS AT FIRST SIGHT LIKE MUDDY FLAGSTONES LONDON THE GREATEST AND RICHEST CITY IN THE WORLD WHERE AN ADVENTUROUS SOUL OUGHT SURELY TO FIND SOME LOOPHOLE FOR AN ADVENTURE THAT PIECE IS HUNG CROOKED DEAR
YOU HAVE TO WAIT UPON HER INSTEAD OF HER WAITING UPON YOU SHE GETS SEASICK ON THE CROSSING AND WHEN SHE REACHES FRANCE OR GERMANY SHE HATES THE MEALS AND SHE DETESTS THE HOTEL SERVANTS AND SHE CAN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE
OMNIBUSES TRAVERSE IT FROM END TO END EVEN I AM TOLD TO ISLINGTON AND PUTNEY WITHIN FOLK SIT FACE TO FACE WHO NEVER SAW ONE ANOTHER BEFORE IN THEIR LIVES AND WHO MAY NEVER SEE ONE ANOTHER AGAIN OR ON THE CONTRARY
I DON'T OBJECT TO GOING TO SCHLANGENBAD I WOULD CONVOY YOU OVER AS COMPANION OR LADY HELP OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU CHOOSE TO CALL IT I WOULD REMAIN WITH YOU THERE FOR A WEEK TILL YOU COULD ARRANGE WITH YOUR GRETCHEN PRESUMABLY UNSOPHISTICATED
OH I REMEMBER YOUR NAME WELL THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY BROKE IN I THINK YOU KNEW MY HUSBAND SIR EVELYN FAWLEY AND MY FATHER LORD KYNASTON THE COUNT LOOKED PROFOUNDLY SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED
LIKE A NATIVE I ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL PROMPTITUDE I WAS AT SCHOOL IN CANTON BERNE
SO THAT SHE'S ALWAYS CALLING YOU IN TO INTERPRET FOR HER IN HER PRIVATE DIFFERENCES WITH THE FILLE DE CHAMBRE AND THE LANDLORD OR ELSE I MUST PICK UP A FRENCH MAID IN LONDON AND I KNOW EQUALLY BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE FRENCH MAIDS ONE ENGAGES IN LONDON
I SAY CONTINENTAL BECAUSE I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE OUT WHETHER HE WAS FRENCH GERMAN OR AUSTRIAN WHO WAS ANXIOUS IN EVERY WAY TO MEET LADY GEORGINA'S WISHES DID MADAME DESIRE TO HAVE THE WINDOW OPEN OH CERTAINLY WITH PLEASURE THE DAY WAS SO SULTRY
I HAVE SUPPRESSED THE GEORGINA IT OUGHT TO BE MADE PENAL TO SEND INNOCENT GIRLS INTO THE WORLD SO BURDENED MY OPINION TO A T YOU ARE REALLY AN EXCEPTIONALLY SENSIBLE YOUNG WOMAN THERE'S MY NAME AND ADDRESS
I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA I ANSWERED CONTINUING TO PASTE ONLY AS I CAN'T TRESPASS UPON YOUR ELEGANT HOSPITALITY FOR LIFE
IF YOU DON'T WISH TO BE OVERHEARD YOU OUGHTN'T TO SHOUT BESIDES I DESIRED TO DO YOU A SERVICE THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY REGARDED ME ONCE MORE FROM HEAD TO FOOT I DID NOT QUAIL THEN
THEN AGAIN ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN'T WAIT TO GET A GRETCHEN AN UNSOPHISTICATED LITTLE GRETCHEN OF THE TAUNUS AT SCHLANGENBAD I SUPPOSE THERE ARE UNSOPHISTICATED GIRLS IN GERMANY STILL MADE IN GERMANY
THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE SOME UNNAMEABLE CHARM SOME FAINT TOUCH OF ECCENTRICITY HA I HAVE IT VIENNA A CARRIAGE WITH FOOTMEN IN RED LIVERY A NOBLE PRESENCE
I NATURALLY MADE UP MY MIND TO GO ROUND THE WORLD IT WAS MY STEPFATHER'S DEATH THAT DROVE ME TO IT I HAD NEVER SEEN MY STEPFATHER INDEED
DO I RECALL HIM CE CHER SIR EVELYN IF I RECALL HIM
PAUSING IN HER PAPERING WITH HER SLEEVES ROLLED UP THEY CALLED ME BROWNIE PARTLY BECAUSE OF MY DARK COMPLEXION BUT PARTLY BECAUSE THEY COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND ME WE ALL KNEW THAT LONG AGO
SO WHEN THE COLONEL DIED IN THE YEAR I WAS LEAVING COLLEGE I DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO GO INTO MOURNING FOR HIM ESPECIALLY AS HE CHOSE THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN MY ALLOWANCE WAS DUE
BUT YOUR FACE HAD IMPRESSED ITSELF ON MY SUB CONSCIOUS SELF I DID NOT LEARN TILL LATER THAT THE ESOTERIC DOCTRINE OF THE SUB CONSCIOUS SELF WAS LADY GEORGINA'S FAVOURITE HOBBY THE MOMENT CHANCE LED ME TO THIS CARRIAGE THIS MORNING
HOW COULD I DO BETTER THAN SET OUT BY THE RHINE COUNTRY THE RHINE LEADS YOU ON TO THE DANUBE THE DANUBE TO THE BLACK SEA THE BLACK SEA TO ASIA AND SO BY WAY OF INDIA CHINA AND JAPAN YOU REACH THE PACIFIC AND SAN FRANCISCO
OR FIND SHE WAS AN ENGLISH GIRL WITHOUT ONE WORD OF GERMAN OR NURSE HER ON THE BOAT WHEN I WANT TO GIVE MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION TO MY OWN MISFORTUNES NO AMELIA I CALL IT POSITIVELY UNKIND OF YOU TO SUGGEST SUCH A THING YOU'RE SO UNSYMPATHETIC
BUT IF YOU DON'T TEACH ELSIE WENT ON GAZING AT ME WITH THOSE WONDERING BIG BLUE EYES OF HERS WHATEVER WILL YOU DO BROWNIE HER HORIZON WAS BOUNDED BY THE SCHOLASTIC CIRCLE
YOU WILL DROP THAT BASKET I HOPE YOU HAVE GOT THROUGH TICKETS VIA MALINES NOT BY BRUSSELS I WON'T GO BY BRUSSELS YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THERE NOW MIND YOU NOTICE HOW MUCH THE LUGGAGE WEIGHS IN ENGLISH POUNDS
WHAT YOU ARE THEN LADY GEORGINA FAWLEY HE CRIED STRIKING AN ATTITUDE INDEED MILADI YOUR ADMIRABLE HUSBAND WAS ONE OF THE VERY FIRST TO EXERT HIS INFLUENCE IN MY FAVOUR AT VIENNA
AND HE HANDED IT ACROSS TO HER SHE READ IT AND PASSED IT ON
NO MADAME I HAVE QUITTED THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE
AND YET AFTER ALL THERE ISN'T MUCH HARM IN YOU I HOPE NOT I SAID DEVOUTLY I WAS BEFORE MY TIME THAT WAS ALL AT PRESENT EVEN A CURATE'S WIFE MAY BLAMELESSLY BICYCLE
HIS WIDOW WENT AND MARRIED THAT GOOD LOOKING SCAPEGRACE JACK WATTS MORGAN NEVER MARRY A MAN MY DEAR WITH A DOUBLE BARRELLED NAME AND NO VISIBLE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE ABOVE ALL IF HE'S GENERALLY KNOWN BY A NICKNAME
A CROWD OF WITS POETS ARTISTS POLITICIANS PRESSING EAGERLY ROUND THE LANDAU THAT WAS MY MENTAL PICTURE AS I SAT AND CONFRONTED YOU I UNDERSTAND IT ALL NOW
AND ON THE SOUTH BY THE AMPHITHEATRE OF THE ALBERT HALL BUT FOR A CENTRE OF ADVENTURE I CHOOSE THE LONG WALK IT BECKONED ME SOMEWHAT AS THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE BECKONED MY SEAFARING ANCESTORS
I AM YOUR EXCELLENCY'S NAME
NO NOT PRECISELY HOWEVER I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING VERY LIKE A RENDEZVOUS DIAVOLO SAID THE DUKE THIS IS A BAD DAY OR RATHER A BAD NIGHT TO BE OUT LATE IS IT NOT COUNTESS THESE WORDS WERE ADDRESSED TO THE COUNTESS G
FRANZ AND THE COUNT GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE PEPPINO PLACED HIMSELF BESIDE ALI AND THEY SET OFF AT A RAPID PACE ALI HAD RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND WENT DOWN THE CORSO CROSSED THE CAMPO VACCINO
IT WAS HE WHO DROVE DISGUISED AS THE COACHMAN REPLIED PEPPINO WELL SAID THE COUNT WELL THEN THE FRENCHMAN TOOK OFF HIS MASK
BY HEAVENS IF I THOUGHT ONE OF YOU KNEW THAT THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS THE FRIEND OF HIS EXCELLENCY I WOULD BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT WITH MY OWN HAND WELL SAID THE COUNT TURNING TOWARDS FRANZ I TOLD YOU THERE WAS SOME MISTAKE IN THIS ARE YOU NOT ALONE
WHICH THE YOUNG MAN TRAVERSED WERE PLUNGED IN THE DEEPEST OBSCURITY THE DISTANCE WAS SHORT AND AT THE END OF TEN MINUTES HIS CARRIAGE OR RATHER THE COUNT'S STOPPED BEFORE THE HOTEL DE LONDRES
NONE SIR REPLIED THE BANDIT YOU ARE AS FREE AS AIR
WHICH HAD REPLACED THE LIGHT AND THE SILENCE WHICH HAD SUCCEEDED THE TURMOIL HAD LEFT IN FRANZ'S MIND A CERTAIN DEPRESSION WHICH WAS NOT FREE FROM UNEASINESS HE THEREFORE DINED VERY SILENTLY IN SPITE OF THE OFFICIOUS ATTENTION OF HIS HOST
THAT HE DID NOT HEAR THE NOISE OF HIS FOOTSTEPS WHO COMES THERE CRIED THE SENTINEL WHO WAS LESS ABSTRACTED AND WHO SAW BY THE LAMP LIGHT A SHADOW APPROACHING HIS CHIEF AT THIS CHALLENGE VAMPA ROSE QUICKLY DRAWING AT THE SAME MOMENT A PISTOL FROM HIS GIRDLE
AND FRANZ AND THE COUNT WERE IN UTTER DARKNESS EXCEPT THAT FIFTY PACES IN ADVANCE OF THEM A REDDISH GLARE MORE EVIDENT SINCE PEPPINO HAD PUT OUT HIS TORCH WAS VISIBLE ALONG THE WALL THEY ADVANCED SILENTLY THE COUNT GUIDING FRANZ
WHO WERE CONCEALED ON THE BANKS OF THE ALMO SURROUNDED THE CARRIAGE THE FRENCHMAN MADE SOME RESISTANCE AND NEARLY STRANGLED BEPPO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST FIVE ARMED MEN AND WAS FORCED TO YIELD THEY MADE HIM GET OUT WALK ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER
SHOULD EVER FEEL INCLINED TO PAY ME A SECOND VISIT WHEREVER I MAY BE YOU SHALL BE WELCOME FRANZ AND ALBERT BOWED THE COUNT WENT OUT FIRST THEN ALBERT FRANZ PAUSED FOR A MOMENT HAS YOUR EXCELLENCY ANYTHING TO ASK ME SAID VAMPA WITH A SMILE
YOU ARE RIGHT YOUR EXCELLENCY HE SAID THIS MUST BE ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS
FRANZ IMAGINED THAT HE SAW SOMETHING LIKE A SENTINEL
A SERIOUS MATTER SAID THE COUNT LOOKING AT FRANZ WITH THE EARNESTNESS USUAL TO HIM AND WHAT MAY IT BE ARE WE ALONE YES REPLIED THE COUNT GOING TO THE DOOR AND RETURNING FRANZ GAVE HIM ALBERT'S LETTER READ THAT HE SAID THE COUNT READ IT
AND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONTRIVE A BETTER HAVE YOU A CARRIAGE NO THAT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE I ALWAYS HAVE ONE READY DAY AND NIGHT ALWAYS READY YES
HE WENT UP TO HIM BUT TO HIS EXTREME ASTONISHMENT THE STRANGER FIRST ADDRESSED HIM WHAT WANTS YOUR EXCELLENCY OF ME INQUIRED THE MAN RETREATING A STEP OR TWO AS IF TO KEEP ON HIS GUARD
WHICH ONE OF THE BANDITS HAD LENT HIM LYING IN A CORNER IN PROFOUND SLUMBER COME SAID THE COUNT SMILING WITH HIS OWN PECULIAR SMILE NOT SO BAD FOR A MAN WHO IS TO BE SHOT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK TO MORROW MORNING VAMPA LOOKED AT ALBERT WITH A KIND OF ADMIRATION
WHO WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN BEFORE A GROTTO WHICH WAS ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE BECAUSE IN THAT SPOT THE DARKNESS SEEMED MORE DENSE THAN ELSEWHERE WHEN THE COUNT THOUGHT FRANZ HAD GAZED SUFFICIENTLY ON THIS PICTURESQUE TABLEAU HE RAISED HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS
THEN IT IS TO YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT THIS LETTER IS ADDRESSED IS THERE ANY ANSWER INQUIRED FRANZ TAKING THE LETTER FROM HIM YES YOUR FRIEND AT LEAST HOPES SO COME UP STAIRS WITH ME AND I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU
HE BOWED AND NOW YOUR EXCELLENCY ADDED HE ALLOW ME TO REPEAT MY APOLOGIES AND I HOPE YOU WILL NOT ENTERTAIN ANY RESENTMENT AT WHAT HAS OCCURRED NO MY DEAR VAMPA REPLIED THE COUNT BESIDES YOU COMPENSATE FOR YOUR MISTAKES IN SO
WENT UP THE STRADA SAN GREGORIO AND REACHED THE GATES OF SAINT SEBASTIAN
SAID ALBERT GAYLY ARRANGING HIS CRAVAT AND WRISTBANDS
RAYS OF LIGHT WERE VISIBLE THE COUNT LAID HIS HAND ON FRANZ'S SHOULDER WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A CAMP OF BANDITS IN REPOSE HE INQUIRED EXCEEDINGLY REPLIED FRANZ COME WITH ME THEN PEPPINO PUT OUT THE TORCH PEPPINO OBEYED
AND THEREFORE WE HAD BETTER GO WITH ALL SPEED TO EXTRICATE HIM FROM THE HANDS OF THE INFIDELS ARE YOU STILL RESOLVED TO ACCOMPANY ME MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER WELL THEN COME ALONG FRANZ AND THE COUNT WENT DOWNSTAIRS ACCOMPANIED BY PEPPINO
AND I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER ME AS UNDER ETERNAL OBLIGATIONS TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR THE CARRIAGE
AND ALBERT FOLLOWED BY FRANZ AND THE COUNT DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE CROSSED THE SQUARE CHAMBER WHERE STOOD ALL THE BANDITS HAT IN HAND PEPPINO SAID THE BRIGAND CHIEF GIVE ME THE TORCH WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO INQUIRED THE COUNT I WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY BACK MYSELF
HE REMEMBERED THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO FRANZ WAS ABOUT TO RING FOR SIGNOR PASTRINI
WERE TO BE SEEN TWENTY BRIGANDS OR MORE EACH HAVING HIS CARBINE WITHIN REACH
THE FRENCHMAN ASKED FOR A RENDEZVOUS
WHO GAINED THE PRIZE IN THE RACE TO DAY REPLIED FRANZ AND THEN MOREOVER WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO HIM WHO CAN TELL
FRANZ FELT A SHUDDER RUN THROUGH HIS VEINS
AND THOSE WHO ARE HERE WILL COMPLAIN OF BUT ONE THING ITS TOO RAPID FLIGHT I AM NOT SPEAKING SAID THE DUKE WITH A SMILE OF THE PERSONS WHO ARE HERE
AS IN THIS MOMENT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ROME UNDER THE MAGIC BREATH OF SOME DEMON OF THE NIGHT HAD SUDDENLY CHANGED INTO A VAST TOMB BY A CHANCE WHICH ADDED YET MORE TO THE INTENSITY OF THE DARKNESS THE MOON WHICH WAS ON THE WANE
WHO PRESENTED HIMSELF TWO OR THREE TIMES TO INQUIRE
THE COUNT SAID A WORD IN ARABIC TO ALI AND THE HORSES WENT ON AT GREAT SPEED IT WAS JUST TWO O'CLOCK BY ALBERT'S WATCH
YOU HAVE SEEN THE MAN WHO DESIRED TO SPEAK WITH YOU FROM YOUR FRIEND HE ASKED OF FRANZ YES I HAVE SEEN HIM HE REPLIED AND HE HAS HANDED THIS LETTER TO ME LIGHT THE CANDLES IN MY APARTMENT
AS HE LIVED AT FLORENCE AND HAD ONLY COME TO ROME TO PASS SEVEN OR EIGHT DAYS HE HAD BROUGHT BUT A HUNDRED LOUIS AND OF THESE HE HAD NOT MORE THAN FIFTY LEFT THUS SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED PIASTRES WERE WANTING
LET US FOLLOW HIM FRANZ AND THE COUNT IN THEIR TURN THEN ADVANCED ALONG THE SAME PATH WHICH AT THE DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED PACES LED THEM OVER A DECLIVITY TO THE BOTTOM OF A SMALL VALLEY THEY THEN PERCEIVED TWO MEN CONVERSING IN THE OBSCURITY
ANY MONEY IT IS USELESS WHERE IS THE MAN WHO BROUGHT THE LETTER IN THE STREET HE AWAITS THE ANSWER YES I MUST LEARN WHERE WE ARE GOING I WILL SUMMON HIM HITHER IT IS USELESS HE WOULD NOT COME UP TO YOUR APARTMENTS PERHAPS
GOING ALONG A NARROW PATH THAT LED OVER THE IRREGULAR AND BROKEN SURFACE OF THE CAMPAGNA AND FINALLY HE DISAPPEARED IN THE MIDST OF THE TALL RED HERBAGE WHICH SEEMED LIKE THE BRISTLING MANE OF AN ENORMOUS LION NOW SAID THE COUNT
AND THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE DOOR THE COUNT TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HALF PAST TWELVE HE SAID
OF THE SECRETARY ADD YOUR OWN TO IT IF IT BE NOT SUFFICIENT RUN TO TORLONIA DRAW FROM HIM INSTANTLY FOUR THOUSAND PIASTRES AND GIVE THEM TO THE BEARER IT IS URGENT THAT I SHOULD HAVE THIS MONEY WITHOUT DELAY
THE POSTSCRIPT IS EXPLICIT I THINK THAT IF YOU WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE OF REFLECTING YOU COULD FIND A WAY OF SIMPLIFYING THE NEGOTIATION SAID FRANZ HOW SO RETURNED THE COUNT WITH SURPRISE IF WE WERE TO GO TOGETHER TO LUIGI VAMPA
TO THEM BOTH TO MAKE UP THE SUM THAT ALBERT REQUIRED TRUE HE MIGHT IN SUCH A CASE RELY ON THE KINDNESS OF SIGNOR TORLONIA HE WAS THEREFORE ABOUT TO RETURN TO THE PALAZZO BRACCIANO WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME WHEN SUDDENLY A LUMINOUS IDEA CROSSED HIS MIND
INQUIRED THE BRIGAND CHIEF TURNING TOWARDS HIS MEN WHO ALL RETREATED BEFORE HIS LOOK WHY HAVE YOU CAUSED ME THUS TO FAIL IN MY WORD TOWARDS A GENTLEMAN LIKE THE COUNT WHO HAS ALL OUR LIVES IN HIS HANDS
SAID THE CAPTAIN THAT IS THE LEAST HONOR THAT I CAN RENDER TO YOUR EXCELLENCY AND TAKING THE LIGHTED TORCH FROM THE HANDS OF THE HERDSMAN HE PRECEDED HIS GUESTS NOT AS A SERVANT WHO PERFORMS AN ACT OF CIVILITY BUT LIKE A KING WHO PRECEDES AMBASSADORS ON REACHING THE DOOR
GENTLEMANLY A WAY THAT ONE ALMOST FEELS OBLIGED TO YOU FOR HAVING COMMITTED THEM GENTLEMEN ADDED THE CHIEF TURNING TOWARDS THE YOUNG MEN PERHAPS THE OFFER MAY NOT APPEAR VERY TEMPTING TO YOU BUT IF YOU
WE SHALL YET HAVE TIME TO FINISH THE NIGHT AT TORLONIA'S YOU MAY CONCLUDE YOUR INTERRUPTED GALOP SO THAT YOU WILL OWE NO ILL WILL TO SIGNOR LUIGI WHO HAS INDEED THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE AFFAIR ACTED LIKE A GENTLEMAN
YOUR EXCELLENCY LODGES AT PASTRINI'S HOTEL I DO
NO EXCELLENCY AND NEVER SHALL I FORGET IT RETURNED PEPPINO WITH AN ACCENT OF PROFOUND GRATITUDE NEVER THAT IS A LONG TIME
YES YOUR EXCELLENCY HE HAS THIS MOMENT RETURNED IS HE IN BED I SHOULD SAY NO THEN RING AT HIS DOOR
SIGNOR PASTRINI DID AS HE WAS DESIRED AND RETURNING FIVE MINUTES AFTER HE SAID THE COUNT AWAITS YOUR EXCELLENCY FRANZ WENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR AND A SERVANT INTRODUCED HIM TO THE COUNT HE WAS IN A SMALL ROOM WHICH FRANZ HAD NOT YET SEEN
SHOULD BE RESPECTED BY YOU AND HOW HAVE I BROKEN THAT TREATY YOUR EXCELLENCY YOU HAVE THIS EVENING CARRIED OFF AND CONVEYED HITHER THE VICOMTE
FIVE CORRIDORS DIVERGED LIKE THE RAYS OF A STAR AND THE WALLS DUG INTO NICHES WHICH WERE ARRANGED ONE ABOVE THE OTHER IN THE SHAPE OF COFFINS SHOWED THAT THEY WERE AT LAST IN THE CATACOMBS DOWN ONE OF THE CORRIDORS WHOSE EXTENT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE
YOU ARE DECIDEDLY RIGHT AND WE MAY REACH THE PALAZZO BY TWO O'CLOCK SIGNOR LUIGI CONTINUED ALBERT
SE ALLE SEI DELLA MATTINA
ANYTHING FRANZ RESOLVED TO WAIT FOR ALBERT AS LATE AS POSSIBLE
SAID THE COUNT BUT PEPPINO INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES SEIZED THE COUNT'S HAND AND COVERED IT WITH KISSES AH SAID THE COUNT YOU HAVE THEN NOT FORGOTTEN THAT I SAVED YOUR LIFE

THEY HAVE PAID MY RANSOM NO YOUR EXCELLENCY WELL THEN HOW AM I FREE A PERSON TO WHOM I CAN REFUSE NOTHING HAS COME TO DEMAND YOU COME HITHER YES HITHER REALLY THEN THAT PERSON IS A MOST AMIABLE PERSON
AND WHISTLED IN A PECULIAR MANNER THE MAN IN THE MANTLE QUITTED THE WALL
ALLOWING HIM TO LEAVE OR ENTER THE CITY AT ANY HOUR OF THE DAY OR NIGHT THE PORTCULLIS WAS THEREFORE RAISED THE PORTER HAD A LOUIS FOR HIS TROUBLE
CERTAINLY FRANZ ENTERED THE HOTEL ON THE STAIRCASE HE MET SIGNOR PASTRINI WELL SAID THE LANDLORD
THE ROAD WHICH THE CARRIAGE NOW TRAVERSED WAS THE ANCIENT APPIAN WAY AND BORDERED WITH TOMBS FROM TIME TO TIME
BE PRUDENT IN ANY EVENT SAID THE COUNTESS OH PRAY BE ASSURED OF THAT FRANZ TOOK HIS HAT AND WENT AWAY IN HASTE HE HAD SENT AWAY HIS CARRIAGE WITH ORDERS FOR IT TO FETCH HIM AT TWO O'CLOCK FORTUNATELY
TO AWAKEN ALBERT STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS RUBBED HIS EYELIDS AND OPENED HIS EYES OH SAID HE IS IT YOU CAPTAIN
HAVE YOU THE MONEY HE DEMANDS YES ALL BUT EIGHT HUNDRED PIASTRES THE COUNT WENT TO HIS SECRETARY OPENED IT AND PULLING OUT A DRAWER FILLED WITH GOLD SAID TO FRANZ

WHO WAS ON THE STEPS OF THE CHURCH OF SAN GIACOMO WHAT EXCLAIMED FRANZ THE PEASANT GIRL WHO SNATCHED HIS MOCOLETTO FROM HIM WAS A LAD OF FIFTEEN REPLIED PEPPINO BUT IT WAS NO DISGRACE TO YOUR FRIEND TO HAVE BEEN DECEIVED
IN A MOMENT ALL THE BANDITS WERE ON THEIR FEET AND TWENTY CARBINES WERE LEVELLED AT THE COUNT WELL SAID HE IN A VOICE PERFECTLY CALM AND NO MUSCLE OF HIS COUNTENANCE DISTURBED WELL MY DEAR VAMPA

IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME THE OPENING OF THE CATACOMBS IS CLOSE AT HAND GO ON THEN REPLIED THE COUNT THEY CAME TO AN OPENING BEHIND A CLUMP OF BUSHES AND IN THE MIDST OF A PILE OF ROCKS BY WHICH A MAN COULD SCARCELY PASS

YOUR PARDON YOUR EXCELLENCY BUT I WAS SO FAR FROM EXPECTING THE HONOR OF A VISIT THAT I DID NOT REALLY RECOGNIZE YOU IT SEEMS THAT YOUR MEMORY IS EQUALLY SHORT IN EVERYTHING VAMPA SAID THE COUNT AND THAT NOT ONLY DO YOU FORGET PEOPLE'S FACES
ALBERT LOOKED AROUND AND PERCEIVED FRANZ WHAT SAID HE IS IT YOU MY DEAR FRANZ WHOSE DEVOTION AND FRIENDSHIP ARE THUS DISPLAYED NO NOT I REPLIED FRANZ BUT OUR NEIGHBOR THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO OH MY DEAR COUNT
THREE ARCADES WERE BEFORE THEM AND THE MIDDLE ONE WAS USED AS A DOOR THESE ARCADES OPENED ON ONE SIDE INTO THE CORRIDOR WHERE THE COUNT AND FRANZ WERE

HERE WAS ONE WHOSE GAY TEMPERAMENT WAS NOT FOR A MOMENT ALTERED AS FOR FRANZ HE WAS ENCHANTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH ALBERT HAD SUSTAINED THE NATIONAL HONOR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BANDIT MY DEAR ALBERT HE SAID IF YOU WILL MAKE HASTE
WE SHALL BE THERE HE THEN TOOK PEPPINO ASIDE GAVE HIM AN ORDER IN A LOW VOICE AND PEPPINO WENT AWAY TAKING WITH HIM A TORCH BROUGHT WITH THEM IN THE CARRIAGE FIVE MINUTES ELAPSED DURING WHICH FRANZ SAW THE SHEPHERD
HAS SENT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT A MAN IS WAITING FOR YOU WITH A LETTER
WHO WERE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE CATACOMBS OF SAINT SEBASTIAN
REPLIED FRANZ I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT WORK YOU WERE PERUSING WITH SO MUCH ATTENTION AS WE ENTERED CAESAR'S COMMENTARIES SAID THE BANDIT
AND HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO THE COUNT WHO SHUDDERED AS HE GAVE HIS OWN BUT WHO NEVERTHELESS DID GIVE IT THE BANDIT GAZED ON THIS SCENE WITH AMAZEMENT HE WAS EVIDENTLY ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIS PRISONERS TREMBLE BEFORE HIM AND YET
PLENTY OF OTHERS AND BEPPO LED HIM OUTSIDE THE WALLS SAID THE COUNT
ARE NOT YOU THE PERSON WHO BROUGHT ME A LETTER INQUIRED FRANZ
INQUIRED INTO THE CAUSE OF HIS ABSENCE BUT FRANZ MERELY REPLIED THAT ALBERT HAD RECEIVED ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AN INVITATION WHICH HE HAD ACCEPTED THE SUDDEN EXTINCTION OF THE MOCCOLETTI THE DARKNESS
THAT SOMETIMES WHEN I RISE OR AFTER MY DINNER OR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I RESOLVE ON STARTING FOR SOME PARTICULAR POINT AND AWAY I GO THE COUNT RANG AND A FOOTMAN APPEARED ORDER OUT THE CARRIAGE HE SAID
DINNER WAS WAITING BUT AS ALBERT HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULD NOT RETURN SO SOON FRANZ SAT DOWN WITHOUT HIM SIGNOR PASTRINI
SAID THE COUNTESS TO FRANZ GO WITH ALL SPEED POOR YOUNG MAN PERHAPS SOME ACCIDENT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM I WILL HASTEN REPLIED FRANZ SHALL WE SEE YOU AGAIN TO GIVE US ANY INFORMATION INQUIRED THE COUNTESS YES IF IT IS NOT ANY SERIOUS AFFAIR
WELL SAID PORTHOS ARRANGE THE TABLE MOUSQUETON
I HAVE SUFFERED DEEPLY MADAME ANSWERED MONTE CRISTO BUT NOW YOU ARE HAPPY DOUBTLESS REPLIED THE COUNT SINCE NO ONE HEARS ME COMPLAIN AND YOUR PRESENT HAPPINESS HAS IT SOFTENED YOUR HEART
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE JOURNEY OF ONE OF MY LADS TO PARIS
THE COUNT BECAME PALE AS DEATH THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HIS HEART AND THEN AGAIN RISING DYED HIS CHEEKS WITH CRIMSON HIS EYES SWAM LIKE THOSE OF A MAN SUDDENLY DAZZLED CERTAINLY WE ARE FRIENDS HE REPLIED WHY SHOULD WE NOT BE
A MAGNIFICENT PEACH WAS HANGING AGAINST AN ADJOINING WALL RIPENED BY THE SAME ARTIFICIAL HEAT MERCEDES DREW NEAR AND PLUCKED THE FRUIT TAKE THIS PEACH THEN SHE SAID THE COUNT AGAIN REFUSED WHAT AGAIN
AND WHAT HAS BECAME OF HIM OH I DON'T KNOW HE HAD ENOUGH AND SET OFF WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE REST BUT YOU MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU SO THAT THIS STRAIN OF THE KNEE CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN MY DEAR PORTHOS KEEPS YOU IN BED
AND YET SAID D'ARTAGNAN LAUGHING IT APPEARS TO ME THAT FROM TIME TO TIME YOU MUST MAKE SORTIES AND HE AGAIN POINTED TO THE BOTTLES AND THE STEWPANS NOT I UNFORTUNATELY SAID PORTHOS THIS MISERABLE STRAIN CONFINES ME TO MY BED
WITHOUT ASKING INFORMATION OF ANY KIND ALIGHTED COMMENDED THE HORSES TO THE CARE OF HIS LACKEY
SHE EXCLAIMED IN SO PLAINTIVE AN ACCENT THAT IT SEEMED TO STIFLE A SOB REALLY YOU PAIN ME A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED THE PEACH LIKE THE GRAPES FELL TO THE GROUND COUNT ADDED MERCEDES WITH A SUPPLICATING GLANCE
ALL LIGHT WHOLESOME FOOD SUITABLE FOR THE SICK BUT THE WINE SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHO FURNISHES THE WINE YOUR HOST THAT IS TO SAY YES AND NO HOW YES AND NO
BEFORE STARTING OUT WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE NAP REMEMBER TO CALL US AT MIDNIGHT SHARP FOR WE MUST CONTINUE ON OUR JOURNEY YES SIR ANSWERED THE INNKEEPER WINKING IN A KNOWING WAY AT THE FOX AND THE CAT AS IF TO SAY I UNDERSTAND
AND DESIRED THE HOST TO BRING HIM A BOTTLE OF HIS BEST WINE AND AS GOOD A BREAKFAST AS POSSIBLE A DESIRE WHICH FURTHER CORROBORATED THE HIGH OPINION THE INNKEEPER HAD FORMED OF THE TRAVELER AT FIRST SIGHT
HE ADOPTED A MIXED BELIEF WHICH PERMITTED HIM TO BE SOMETIMES CATHOLIC SOMETIMES A HUGUENOT
WHEN WAR CAME AND CARRIED ME AWAY I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME WELL ENOUGH TO WAIT FOR ME AND EVEN TO REMAIN FAITHFUL TO MY MEMORY WHEN I RETURNED SHE WAS MARRIED THIS IS THE HISTORY OF MOST MEN WHO HAVE PASSED TWENTY YEARS OF AGE
THIS PROBABILITY AFFORDED HIM HIS FIRST CONSOLATION IF BONACIEUX KNEW WHERE HIS WIFE WAS ONE MIGHT BY EXTREME MEANS FORCE THE MERCER TO OPEN HIS TEETH AND LET HIS SECRET ESCAPE
HAPPINESS COMES TO MEET HIM DOES IT NOT MONSIEUR BONACIEUX BONACIEUX BECAME AS PALE AS DEATH AND GRINNED A GHASTLY SMILE AH AH SAID BONACIEUX YOU ARE A JOCULAR COMPANION
YOUR LORDSHIP DOES ME MUCH HONOR SAID THE HOST AND I THANK YOU SINCERELY FOR YOUR KIND WISH BUT DON'T MISTAKE SAID D'ARTAGNAN THERE IS MORE SELFISHNESS IN MY TOAST THAN PERHAPS YOU MAY THINK
WHERE DID MY GOOD FRIENDS SAY THEY WOULD WAIT FOR ME HE ADDED
BUT MOUSQUETON FORAGES AND BRINGS IN PROVISIONS FRIEND MOUSQUETON YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE A REINFORCEMENT AND WE MUST HAVE AN INCREASE OF SUPPLIES MOUSQUETON SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU MUST RENDER ME A SERVICE WHAT MONSIEUR
WHILE A SPIT LOADED WITH PARTRIDGES WAS TURNING BEFORE THE FIRE AND ON EACH SIDE OF A LARGE CHIMNEYPIECE OVER TWO CHAFING DISHES WERE BOILING TWO STEWPANS FROM WHICH EXHALED A DOUBLE ODOR OF RABBIT AND FISH STEWS
YOUR LORDSHIP MUST HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY WHY TO BE SURE HE PROMISED TO REJOIN US AND WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF HIM HE HAS DONE US THE HONOR TO REMAIN HERE WHAT HE HAD DONE YOU THE HONOR TO REMAIN HERE
ROUND ABOUT HIM NOT A LEAF STIRRED A FEW BATS SKIMMED HIS NOSE NOW AND AGAIN AND SCARED HIM HALF TO DEATH
HE FOUND PLANCHET IN A GREAT FRIGHT AH MONSIEUR
ALL FALSEHOOD IS A MASK AND HOWEVER WELL MADE THE MASK MAY BE WITH A LITTLE ATTENTION WE MAY ALWAYS SUCCEED IN DISTINGUISHING IT FROM THE TRUE FACE
THE ANSWER WAS SO LITTLE LIKE THE ONE MERCEDES DESIRED THAT SHE TURNED AWAY TO GIVE VENT TO A SIGH WHICH SOUNDED MORE LIKE A GROAN THANK YOU SHE SAID AND THEY WALKED ON AGAIN
WELL SHE MUST BE AT HER COUNTRY SEAT FOR SHE HAS NOT ANSWERED ME TRULY NO SO I YESTERDAY ADDRESSED ANOTHER EPISTLE TO HER STILL MORE PRESSING THAN THE FIRST
JUST AS PINOCCHIO STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE A HANDFUL OF THEM HE WAS AWAKENED BY THREE LOUD KNOCKS AT THE DOOR IT WAS THE INNKEEPER WHO HAD COME TO TELL HIM THAT MIDNIGHT HAD STRUCK ARE MY FRIENDS READY THE MARIONETTE ASKED HIM
AND WHAT WAS THE END OF THIS WORTHY MAN ASKED D'ARTAGNAN OH OF THE MOST UNFORTUNATE KIND MONSIEUR ONE DAY HE WAS SURPRISED IN A LONELY ROAD BETWEEN A HUGUENOT AND A CATHOLIC WITH BOTH OF WHOM HE HAD BEFORE HAD BUSINESS
WELL CAN I SEE PORTHOS CERTAINLY MONSIEUR TAKE THE STAIRS ON YOUR RIGHT GO UP THE FIRST FLIGHT AND KNOCK AT NUMBER ONE ONLY WARN HIM THAT IT IS YOU WHY SHOULD I DO THAT
MONSIEUR I FOLLOWED THEM FROM CURIOSITY SO THAT I SAW THE COMBAT WITHOUT THE COMBATANTS SEEING ME AND WHAT TOOK PLACE OH THE AFFAIR WAS NOT LONG I ASSURE YOU THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON GUARD
SO SO REPLIED PORTHOS ONLY THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO THE IMPERTINENT JACKANAPES GAVE ME HIS BILL AND I WAS FORCED TO TURN BOTH HIM AND HIS BILL OUT OF THE DOOR SO THAT I AM HERE
THAT BONACIEUX WAS TERRIFIED AT IT AND HE ENDEAVORED TO DRAW BACK A STEP OR TWO BUT AS HE WAS STANDING BEFORE THE HALF OF THE DOOR WHICH WAS SHUT THE OBSTACLE COMPELLED HIM TO KEEP HIS PLACE
WAS BONACIEUX HIMSELF THE HUSBAND HAD PRESIDED AT THE ABDUCTION OF HIS WIFE A TERRIBLE INCLINATION SEIZED D'ARTAGNAN TO GRASP THE MERCER BY THE THROAT AND STRANGLE HIM BUT AS WE HAVE SAID
PORTHOS SEEMED TO BREATHE MORE FREELY AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU MY DEAR PORTHOS CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN WHY ON MAKING A THRUST AT MY ADVERSARY WHOM I HAD ALREADY HIT THREE TIMES AND WHOM I MEANT TO FINISH WITH THE FOURTH
AS HE WAS SO IN NEED OF STRENGTH HE HAD TO HAVE FOUR MORE HELPINGS OF BUTTER AND CHEESE THE FOX AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF COAXING TRIED HIS BEST TO EAT A LITTLE THE DOCTOR HAD PUT HIM ON A DIET AND HE HAD TO BE SATISFIED WITH A SMALL HARE
ALLOW ME TO TAKE A GLASS OF WATER IN YOUR APARTMENT YOU KNOW THAT IS NEVER REFUSED AMONG NEIGHBORS WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE PERMISSION OF HIS HOST D'ARTAGNAN WENT QUICKLY INTO THE HOUSE AND CAST A RAPID GLANCE AT THE BED IT HAD NOT BEEN USED
YOU SAID THAT PORTHOS HAD RECEIVED A SWORD CUT YES BUT HE HAS FORBIDDEN ME SO STRICTLY TO SAY SO AND WHY SO ZOUNDS MONSIEUR BECAUSE HE HAD BOASTED THAT HE WOULD PERFORATE THE STRANGER WITH WHOM YOU LEFT HIM IN DISPUTE
THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL ARABIAN CUSTOM WHICH MAKES ETERNAL FRIENDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE TOGETHER EATEN BREAD AND SALT UNDER THE SAME ROOF I KNOW IT MADAME REPLIED THE COUNT BUT WE ARE IN FRANCE AND NOT IN ARABIA
PINOCCHIO PAID A GOLD PIECE FOR THE THREE SUPPERS AND STARTED ON HIS WAY TOWARD THE FIELD THAT WAS TO MAKE HIM A RICH MAN HE WALKED ON NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS GOING FOR IT WAS DARK SO DARK THAT NOT A THING WAS VISIBLE
DON'T BE AFRAID HE IS NOT SO MUCH OF A DEVIL AS HE APPEARS
I MUST ALLOW AS YOU SAY YOUR FATHER WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT FELLOW AND YOU SAY IN HIS LEISURE MOMENTS THE WORTHY MAN WAS A POACHER YES MONSIEUR AND IT WAS HE WHO TAUGHT ME TO LAY A SNARE AND GROUND A LINE THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WHEN I SAW OUR LABORERS
IT IS THAT AS I WAS CRUELLY BORED AS YOU SAY AND AS I HAD THE SEVENTY FIVE PISTOLES IN MY POCKET WHICH YOU HAD DISTRIBUTED TO ME IN ORDER TO AMUSE MYSELF I INVITED A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS TRAVELING THIS WAY TO WALK UP AND PROPOSED A CAST OF DICE
THAT WHEN HE SAW A HUGUENOT COMING HE FELT HIMSELF FILLED WITH SUCH ARDENT CATHOLIC ZEAL
BUT STEPPED BACK DO YOU REFUSE SAID MERCEDES IN A TREMULOUS VOICE PRAY EXCUSE ME MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BUT I NEVER EAT MUSCATEL GRAPES MERCEDES LET THEM FALL AND SIGHED
AND HAVE YOU FORGIVEN HER FOR ALL SHE HAS MADE YOU SUFFER HER YES BUT ONLY HER
DRESSED WITH A DOZEN YOUNG AND TENDER SPRING CHICKENS AFTER THE HARE HE ORDERED SOME PARTRIDGES A FEW PHEASANTS A COUPLE OF RABBITS AND A DOZEN FROGS AND LIZARDS THAT WAS ALL HE FELT ILL HE SAID AND COULD NOT EAT ANOTHER BITE
REMEMBER THAT BOYS WHO INSIST ON HAVING THEIR OWN WAY SOONER OR LATER COME TO GRIEF THE SAME NONSENSE GOOD BY CRICKET GOOD NIGHT PINOCCHIO AND MAY HEAVEN PRESERVE YOU FROM THE ASSASSINS THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MINUTE
WHAT CONSEQUENCE CAN THE REVERSES OF FORTUNE BE TO YOU HAVE YOU NOT HAPPY ROGUE THAT YOU ARE
I HAD RECOURSE TO A LITTLE OF MY OLD TRADE WHILE WALKING NEAR THE WOOD OF MONSIEUR LE PRINCE I LAID A FEW SNARE IN THE RUNS AND WHILE RECLINING ON THE BANKS OF HIS HIGHNESS'S PIECES OF WATER I SLIPPED A FEW LINES INTO HIS FISH PONDS SO THAT NOW THANKS BE TO GOD
I CANNOT TELL YOU MONSIEUR WHAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME SURELY YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PERSON YES BUT IN OUR SITUATION WE MUST NOT SAY ALL WE KNOW PARTICULARLY AS WE HAVE BEEN WARNED THAT OUR EARS SHOULD ANSWER FOR OUR TONGUES
THE HOUR IS LATE I WANT TO GO ON THE NIGHT IS VERY DARK I WANT TO GO ON THE ROAD IS DANGEROUS I WANT TO GO ON
THANKS MONSIEUR BONACIEUX SAID D'ARTAGNAN EMPTYING HIS GLASS THAT IS ALL I WANTED OF YOU I WILL NOW GO UP INTO MY APARTMENT I WILL MAKE PLANCHET BRUSH MY BOOTS AND WHEN HE HAS DONE I WILL IF YOU LIKE SEND HIM TO YOU TO BRUSH YOUR SHOES
AND WHO BOTH KNEW HIM AGAIN SO THEY UNITED AGAINST HIM AND HANGED HIM ON A TREE
DON'T LISTEN TO THOSE WHO PROMISE YOU WEALTH OVERNIGHT MY BOY AS A RULE THEY ARE EITHER FOOLS OR SWINDLERS LISTEN TO ME AND GO HOME
HOWEVER NOT ONE OF THEM WAS VERY HUNGRY THE POOR CAT FELT VERY WEAK AND HE WAS ABLE TO EAT ONLY THIRTY FIVE MULLETS WITH TOMATO SAUCE AND FOUR PORTIONS OF TRIPE WITH CHEESE MOREOVER
MY FRIEND PLACED A BOTTLE AT THE DISTANCE OF THIRTY PACES AND AT EACH CAST HE CAUGHT THE NECK OF THE BOTTLE IN HIS RUNNING NOOSE I PRACTICED THIS EXERCISE AND AS NATURE HAS ENDOWED ME WITH SOME FACULTIES AT THIS DAY I CAN THROW THE LASSO WITH ANY MAN IN THE WORLD WELL
THE PROTESTANT RELIGION IMMEDIATELY PREVAILED IN HIS MIND HE LOWERED HIS GUN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAVELER THEN WHEN HE WAS WITHIN TEN PACES OF HIM HE COMMENCED A CONVERSATION WHICH ALMOST ALWAYS ENDED BY THE TRAVELER'S ABANDONING HIS PURSE TO SAVE HIS LIFE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING
BUT YOU ARE HERE MY DEAR FELLOW LET US SPEAK OF YOU I CONFESS I BEGAN TO BE VERY UNEASY ON YOUR ACCOUNT BUT YOUR HOST BEHAVES VERY WELL TOWARD YOU AS IT APPEARS MY DEAR PORTHOS
BUT THERE THE CONFIDENCE OF D'ARTAGNAN STOPPED HE ONLY ADDED THAT ON HIS RETURN FROM GREAT BRITAIN HE HAD BROUGHT BACK FOUR MAGNIFICENT HORSES
WHY I WAS HERE ONLY TEN OR TWELVE DAYS AGO I WAS CONDUCTING SOME FRIENDS MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM BY THE BY HAD A DISPUTE WITH A STRANGER
WELL YOUNG MAN SAID HE WE APPEAR TO PASS RATHER GAY NIGHTS SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING PESTE YOU SEEM TO REVERSE ORDINARY CUSTOMS AND COME HOME AT THE HOUR WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING OUT
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NEVER COME IN WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW PLANCHET DEMANDED D'ARTAGNAN OH I GIVE YOU A HUNDRED I GIVE YOU A THOUSAND TIMES TO GUESS MONSIEUR THE VISIT I RECEIVED IN YOUR ABSENCE WHEN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO WHILE YOU WERE AT MONSIEUR DE TREVILLE'S
AS THOUGH AWAKENING FROM A SLEEP TO THE REALITIES OF LIFE DID YOU SAY A MISFORTUNE INDEED I SHOULD EXPECT MISFORTUNES
EXACTLY SO SAID THE HOST I REMEMBER IT PERFECTLY IT IS NOT MONSIEUR PORTHOS THAT YOUR LORDSHIP MEANS YES THAT IS MY COMPANION'S NAME MY GOD MY DEAR HOST TELL ME IF ANYTHING HAS HAPPENED TO HIM
AND IN FRANCE ETERNAL FRIENDSHIPS ARE AS RARE AS THE CUSTOM OF DIVIDING BREAD AND SALT WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT SAID THE COUNTESS BREATHLESSLY WITH HER EYES FIXED ON MONTE CRISTO WHOSE ARM SHE CONVULSIVELY PRESSED WITH BOTH HANDS WE ARE FRIENDS ARE WE NOT
ONE CAN ONLY LOVE ONCE AND DID YOU EVER SEE HER AGAIN NEVER NEVER I NEVER RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY WHERE SHE LIVED TO MALTA YES MALTA SHE IS THEN NOW AT MALTA I THINK SO
YES MONSIEUR IN THIS HOUSE AND WE ARE EVEN A LITTLE UNEASY ON WHAT ACCOUNT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES HE HAS CONTRACTED WELL BUT WHATEVER EXPENSES HE MAY HAVE INCURRED I AM SURE HE IS IN A CONDITION TO PAY THEM
HOW COULD THEY DO SUCH A THING BEING PEOPLE OF GREAT REFINEMENT THEY DID NOT WANT TO OFFEND YOU SO DEEPLY AS NOT TO ALLOW YOU THE HONOR OF PAYING THE BILL TOO BAD
I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE COUNTRY AND MY FATHER IN HIS LEISURE TIME WAS SOMETHING OF A POACHER
NO FATHER I HAVE NO ONE HOW CAN YOU EXIST THUS WITHOUT ANY ONE TO ATTACH YOU TO LIFE IT IS NOT MY FAULT MADAME AT MALTA I LOVED A YOUNG GIRL WAS ON THE POINT OF MARRYING HER
AH MONSIEUR YOU INFUSE GENUINE BALM INTO MY BLOOD WE HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES AND THIS VERY MORNING THE SURGEON DECLARED THAT IF MONSIEUR PORTHOS DID NOT PAY HIM HE SHOULD LOOK TO ME AS IT WAS I WHO HAD SENT FOR HIM PORTHOS IS WOUNDED THEN
AND GATHERED A BUNCH OF MUSCATEL GRAPES SEE COUNT SHE SAID WITH A SMILE SO SAD IN ITS EXPRESSION THAT ONE COULD ALMOST DETECT THE TEARS ON HER EYELIDS SEE OUR FRENCH GRAPES ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED I KNOW WITH YOURS OF SICILY AND CYPRUS
THIS WAS FULFILLING THE INTENTIONS OF MONSIEUR PORTHOS WHO HAD DESIRED US TO BE SO CAREFUL OF THIS LETTER WAS IT NOT NEARLY SO WELL MONSIEUR DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS GREAT LADY IS NO I HAVE HEARD PORTHOS SPEAK OF HER
I PUT MY FOOT ON A STONE SLIPPED AND STRAINED MY KNEE TRULY HONOR
HE FURNISHES IT IT IS TRUE BUT HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE HAS THAT HONOR EXPLAIN YOURSELF MOUSQUETON YOUR CONVERSATION IS FULL OF INSTRUCTIVE THINGS THAT IS IT MONSIEUR
ADDED HE LOOKING AT D'ARTAGNAN WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF UNEASINESS YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME NO
HE ACCEPTED MY CHALLENGE AND MY FAITH MY SEVENTY FIVE PISTOLES PASSED FROM MY POCKET TO HIS WITHOUT RECKONING MY HORSE WHICH HE WON INTO THE BARGAIN BUT YOU MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT MY DEAR PORTHOS
MONSIEUR HE CARRIED ON A TRADE WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT SATISFACTORY WHICH
WELL YOU SEE MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WITH WHAT ILL LUCK I PLAY REPLIED PORTHOS WITH THE MOST CARELESS AIR IN THE WORLD I WROTE TO HER TO SEND ME FIFTY LOUIS OR SO
WHO ALTHOUGH SHE IS AT LEAST FIFTY STILL GIVES HERSELF JEALOUS AIRS
THAT'S UNPARDONABLE IN A MAN OF YOUR AGE AND WHO BESIDES HAS SUCH A PRETTY WIFE AS YOURS OH LORD NO
REJOICING TO THE SMELL IN ADDITION TO THIS HE PERCEIVED THAT THE TOP OF A WARDROBE AND THE MARBLE OF A COMMODE WERE COVERED WITH EMPTY BOTTLES AT THE SIGHT OF HIS FRIEND PORTHOS UTTERED A LOUD CRY OF JOY
WHO GOES THERE WHO GOES AS HE WALKED PINOCCHIO NOTICED A TINY INSECT GLIMMERING ON THE TRUNK OF A TREE A SMALL BEING THAT GLOWED WITH A PALE SOFT LIGHT WHO ARE YOU HE ASKED I AM THE GHOST OF THE TALKING CRICKET
IT IS A WOUND THAT CONFINES HIM TO HIS BED AH AND A MASTER STROKE TOO I ASSURE YOU YOUR FRIEND'S SOUL MUST STICK TIGHT TO HIS BODY WERE YOU THERE THEN
THEY WENT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE GARDEN WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD SIR SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED THE COUNTESS AFTER THEIR WALK HAD CONTINUED TEN MINUTES IN SILENCE IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE SEEN SO MUCH TRAVELLED SO FAR AND SUFFERED SO DEEPLY
DESPITE THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS UNIFORM COULD NOT FAIL TO MAKE A SENSATION THE HOST DESIRED HIMSELF TO SERVE HIM
WILLINGLY SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHILE PORTHOS AND MOUSQUETON WERE BREAKFASTING WITH THE APPETITES OF CONVALESCENTS AND WITH THAT BROTHERLY CORDIALITY WHICH UNITES MEN IN MISFORTUNE D'ARTAGNAN RELATED HOW ARAMIS BEING WOUNDED WAS OBLIGED TO STOP AT CREVECOEUR
D'ARTAGNAN WAS THEREFORE SERVED WITH MIRACULOUS CELERITY THE REGIMENT OF THE GUARDS WAS RECRUITED AMONG THE FIRST GENTLEMEN OF THE KINGDOM AND D'ARTAGNAN FOLLOWED BY A LACKEY AND TRAVELING WITH FOUR MAGNIFICENT HORSES
WHEN D'ARTAGNAN HAD FINISHED HE SAID HUM ALL THIS SAVORS OF HIS EMINENCE A LEAGUE OFF BUT WHAT IS TO BE DONE SAID D'ARTAGNAN NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT PRESENT BUT QUITTING PARIS AS I TOLD YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
MONTE CRISTO REMAINED AS UNMOVED AS IF THE REPROACH HAD NOT BEEN ADDRESSED TO HIM ALBERT AT THIS MOMENT RAN IN OH MOTHER HE EXCLAIMED SUCH A MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED WHAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED ASKED THE COUNTESS
MADAME I NEVER EAT MUSCATEL GRAPES REPLIED MONTE CRISTO AS IF THE SUBJECT HAD NOT BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE THE COUNTESS DASHED THE GRAPES INTO THE NEAREST THICKET WITH A GESTURE OF DESPAIR INFLEXIBLE MAN SHE MURMURED
AND I ON THAT OF THE HUGUENOT TWO HOURS AFTER ALL WAS OVER WE HAD DONE THE BUSINESS OF BOTH ADMIRING THE FORESIGHT OF OUR POOR FATHER WHO HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION TO BRING EACH OF US UP IN A DIFFERENT RELIGION WELL
D'ARTAGNAN REMARKED SOMETHING PERFIDIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE PLAY OF THE WRINKLED FEATURES OF HIS COUNTENANCE A ROGUE DOES NOT LAUGH IN THE SAME WAY THAT AN HONEST MAN DOES A HYPOCRITE DOES NOT SHED THE TEARS OF A MAN OF GOOD FAITH
WELL HE COMES TO FETCH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER WHY SO
ANSWERED THE LITTLE BEING IN A FAINT VOICE THAT SOUNDED AS IF IT CAME FROM A FAR AWAY WORLD WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE MARIONETTE I WANT TO GIVE YOU A FEW WORDS OF GOOD ADVICE
THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO HAVE ANY DOUBTS UPON THE SUPERIORITY OF OUR HOLY RELIGION FOR MY PART MONSIEUR I AM CATHOLIC MY FATHER FAITHFUL TO HIS PRINCIPLES HAVING MADE MY ELDER BROTHER A HUGUENOT
PERHAPS MY HEART WAS WEAKER THAN THE HEARTS OF MOST MEN AND I SUFFERED MORE THAN THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IN MY PLACE THAT IS ALL THE COUNTESS STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AS IF GASPING FOR BREATH YES SHE SAID
DO NOT MY MOTHER AND YOU AGREE ASKED ALBERT ASTONISHED ON THE CONTRARY REPLIED THE COUNT DID YOU NOT HEAR HER DECLARE THAT WE WERE FRIENDS THEY RE ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM
PARDON MY DEAR MONSIEUR BONACIEUX IF I DON'T STAND UPON CEREMONY SAID D'ARTAGNAN BUT NOTHING MAKES ONE SO THIRSTY AS WANT OF SLEEP I AM PARCHED WITH THIRST
THEY REACHED THE BUILDING ORNAMENTED WITH MAGNIFICENT FRUITS WHICH RIPEN AT THE BEGINNING OF JULY IN THE ARTIFICIAL TEMPERATURE WHICH TAKES THE PLACE OF THE SUN SO FREQUENTLY ABSENT IN OUR CLIMATE THE COUNTESS LEFT THE ARM OF MONTE CRISTO
BECAUSE SHE FLEW INTO A GREAT PASSION ON RECEIVING THE LETTER
THE PLACE NAMED BY BONACIEUX AS THAT WHICH HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF HIS JOURNEY WAS A FRESH PROOF IN SUPPORT OF THE SUSPICIONS D'ARTAGNAN HAD CONCEIVED
HE ASSISTED HIM TO RISE BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE HOTEL MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND DISAPPEARED SO IT WAS WITH MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN THIS STRANGER MEANT TO QUARREL IT APPEARS SO
THEN A SUDDEN IDEA CROSSED THE MIND OF D'ARTAGNAN THAT LITTLE STOUT MAN SHORT AND ELDERLY THAT SORT OF LACKEY DRESSED IN DARK CLOTHES TREATED WITHOUT CEREMONY BY THE MEN WEARING SWORDS WHO COMPOSED THE ESCORT
THAT'S ALL DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS PRETENDED DUCHESS IS I REPEAT TO YOU I DON'T KNOW HER
I WILL SEE THE QUEEN I WILL RELATE TO HER THE DETAILS OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS POOR WOMAN OF WHICH SHE IS NO DOUBT IGNORANT THESE DETAILS WILL GUIDE HER ON HER PART AND ON YOUR RETURN I SHALL PERHAPS HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS TO TELL YOU RELY ON ME
THE HOST ON SEEING A YOUNG MAN FOLLOWED BY A LACKEY WITH TWO EXTRA HORSES ADVANCED RESPECTFULLY TO THE DOOR NOW AS THEY HAD ALREADY TRAVELED ELEVEN LEAGUES D'ARTAGNAN THOUGHT IT TIME TO STOP
RETURN HOME AND GIVE THE FOUR GOLD PIECES YOU HAVE LEFT TO YOUR POOR OLD FATHER WHO IS WEEPING BECAUSE HE HAS NOT SEEN YOU FOR MANY A DAY TOMORROW MY FATHER WILL BE A RICH MAN FOR THESE FOUR GOLD PIECES WILL BECOME TWO THOUSAND
I HATE THEM NOT AT ALL WHY SHOULD I THE COUNTESS PLACED HERSELF BEFORE MONTE CRISTO STILL HOLDING IN HER HAND A PORTION OF THE PERFUMED GRAPES TAKE SOME SHE SAID
NO I NEVER SAW HIM UNTIL THAT MOMENT AND HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE VERY WELL I KNOW ALL THAT I WISH TO KNOW PORTHOS'S CHAMBER IS YOU SAY ON THE FIRST STORY NUMBER ONE
D'ARTAGNAN GLANCED DOWN AT HIS BOOTS ALL COVERED WITH MUD BUT THAT SAME GLANCE FELL UPON THE SHOES AND STOCKINGS OF THE MERCER AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID THEY HAD BEEN DIPPED IN THE SAME MUD HEAP BOTH WERE STAINED WITH SPLASHES OF MUD OF THE SAME APPEARANCE
NO ONE CAN REPROACH YOU FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND MONSIEUR BONACIEUX SAID THE YOUNG MAN YOU ARE A MODEL FOR REGULAR PEOPLE IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN A MAN POSSESSES A YOUNG AND PRETTY WIFE HE HAS NO NEED TO SEEK HAPPINESS ELSEWHERE
A MAN IS NOT PRIVILEGED IN ALL WAYS SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU KNOW THE PROVERB UNLUCKY AT PLAY LUCKY IN LOVE
IN FACT IN ADDITION TO THAT YELLOW SICKLY PALENESS WHICH INDICATES THE INSINUATION OF THE BILE IN THE BLOOD AND WHICH MIGHT BESIDES BE ACCIDENTAL
AND THAT SHE WAS SURE IT WAS FOR SOME WOMAN HE HAD RECEIVED THIS WOUND HAS HE BEEN WOUNDED THEN OH GOOD LORD
THIS TIME HE HAD DECIDED TO RELATE ALL THAT HAD PASSED
SHE IS A SLAVE WHOM I BOUGHT AT CONSTANTINOPLE MADAME THE DAUGHTER OF A PRINCE I HAVE ADOPTED HER AS MY DAUGHTER HAVING NO ONE ELSE TO LOVE IN THE WORLD YOU LIVE ALONE THEN I DO YOU HAVE NO SISTER NO SON
PINOCCHIO ATE LEAST OF ALL HE ASKED FOR A BITE OF BREAD AND A FEW NUTS AND THEN HARDLY TOUCHED THEM THE POOR FELLOW WITH HIS MIND ON THE FIELD OF WONDERS WAS SUFFERING FROM A GOLD PIECE INDIGESTION
MY GOD THAT'S ALL I SHALL BE ABOUT AGAIN IN A FEW DAYS WHY DID YOU NOT HAVE YOURSELF CONVEYED TO PARIS YOU MUST BE CRUELLY BORED HERE THAT WAS MY INTENTION BUT MY DEAR FRIEND I HAVE ONE THING TO CONFESS TO YOU WHAT'S THAT
WHEREAS THE STRANGER ON THE CONTRARY IN SPITE OF ALL HIS RODOMONTADES QUICKLY THREW HIM ON HIS BACK AS MONSIEUR PORTHOS IS A VERY BOASTFUL MAN HE INSISTS THAT NOBODY SHALL KNOW HE HAS RECEIVED THIS WOUND EXCEPT THE DUCHESS
BUT WHAT SHALL WE DRINK TO SO AS TO AVOID WOUNDING ANY SUSCEPTIBILITY LET US DRINK TO THE PROSPERITY OF YOUR ESTABLISHMENT
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS UPON THE MOST CONSPICUOUS DOOR OF THE CORRIDOR WAS TRACED IN BLACK INK A GIGANTIC NUMBER ONE D'ARTAGNAN KNOCKED AND UPON THE BIDDING TO COME IN WHICH CAME FROM INSIDE HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER
AND COMMENCED THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION MY FAITH MY GOOD HOST SAID D'ARTAGNAN FILLING THE TWO GLASSES
IT HAS SO CHANCED THAT I MET WITH A SPANIARD IN MY PEREGRINATIONS WHO HAD SEEN MANY COUNTRIES AND AMONG THEM THE NEW WORLD WHAT CONNECTION CAN THE NEW WORLD HAVE WITH THE BOTTLES WHICH ARE ON THE COMMODE AND THE WARDROBE PATIENCE MONSIEUR EVERYTHING WILL COME IN ITS TURN
THE FALSEHOOD WOULD THEN LIE AT MY DOOR AND AS I AM NOT A GENTLEMAN I MAY BE ALLOWED TO LIE
OUR HOST HAS A WELL FURNISHED CELLAR THE KEY OF WHICH NEVER LEAVES HIM ONLY THIS CELLAR HAS A VENTILATING HOLE NOW THROUGH THIS VENTILATING HOLE I THROW MY LASSO AND AS I NOW KNOW IN WHICH PART OF THE CELLAR IS THE BEST WINE THAT'S MY POINT FOR SPORT
NO ONE TOLD ME YOU WERE
INSTEAD OF RETURNING DIRECTLY HOME
THE COUNT LOOKED AT MERCEDES AS IF TO INTERROGATE HER BUT SHE CONTINUED TO WALK ON IN SILENCE AND HE REFRAINED FROM SPEAKING
INDEED YES THEY WENT TWO HOURS AGO WHY IN SUCH A HURRY UNFORTUNATELY THE CAT RECEIVED A TELEGRAM WHICH SAID THAT HIS FIRST BORN WAS SUFFERING FROM CHILBLAINS AND WAS ON THE POINT OF DEATH
THE STRANGER PLACED THE POINT OF HIS SWORD AT HIS THROAT AND MONSIEUR PORTHOS FINDING HIMSELF AT THE MERCY OF HIS ADVERSARY ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF CONQUERED
BE THIS A SEAL ALL MEN TO UNDECEIVE OUT OF THE MOUTH OF EACH ONE THERE PROTRUDED THE FEET OF A TRANSGRESSOR AND THE LEGS UP TO THE CALF THE REST WITHIN REMAINED IN ALL OF THEM THE SOLES WERE BOTH ON FIRE WHEREFORE THE JOINTS SO VIOLENTLY QUIVERED
FOR ALL UPON ONE SIDE TOWARDS THE CASTLE THEIR FACES HAVE AND GO UNTO SAINT PETER'S ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY GO TOWARDS THE MOUNTAIN THIS SIDE AND THAT ALONG THE LIVID STONE BEHELD I HORNED DEMONS WITH GREAT SCOURGES
AND I WHAT PLEASES THEE TO ME IS PLEASING THOU ART MY LORD AND KNOWEST THAT I DEPART NOT FROM THY DESIRE AND KNOWEST WHAT IS NOT SPOKEN STRAIGHTWAY UPON THE FOURTH DIKE WE ARRIVED
NOW GET THEE GONE AND SINCE THOU'RT STILL ALIVE KNOW THAT A NEIGHBOUR OF MINE VITALIANO WILL HAVE HIS SEAT HERE ON MY LEFT HAND SIDE A PADUAN AM I WITH THESE FLORENTINES FULL MANY A TIME THEY THUNDER IN MINE EARS EXCLAIMING COME THE SOVEREIGN CAVALIER
HE SAID TO ME SOON THERE WILL UPWARD COME WHAT I AWAIT AND WHAT THY THOUGHT IS DREAMING MUST SOON REVEAL ITSELF UNTO THY SIGHT
BY A THOUSAND SPRINGS I THINK AND MORE IS BATHED TWIXT GARDA AND VAL CAMONICA PENNINO WITH WATER THAT GROWS STAGNANT IN THAT LAKE MIDWAY A PLACE IS WHERE THE TRENTINE PASTOR AND HE OF BRESCIA
I LEAVE THE GALL AND GO FOR THE SWEET FRUITS PROMISED TO ME BY THE VERACIOUS LEADER BUT TO THE CENTRE FIRST I NEEDS MUST PLUNGE SO MAY THE SOUL FOR A LONG WHILE CONDUCT THOSE LIMBS OF THINE DID HE MAKE ANSWER THEN
THAT ARUNS IS WHO BACKS THE OTHER'S BELLY WHO IN THE HILLS OF LUNI
AND HEREWITH LET OUR SIGHT BE SATISFIED
WITHIN THIS PLACE DOWN SHAKEN FROM THE BACK OF GERYON WE FOUND US AND THE POET HELD TO THE LEFT AND I MOVED ON BEHIND UPON MY RIGHT HAND I BEHELD NEW ANGUISH NEW TORMENTS AND NEW WIELDERS OF THE LASH WHEREWITH THE FOREMOST BOLGIA WAS REPLETE
THEN SAID TO ME THE GUIDE SEE THAT THOU THRUST THY VISAGE SOMEWHAT FARTHER IN ADVANCE THAT WITH THINE EYES THOU WELL THE FACE ATTAIN OF THAT UNCLEANLY AND DISHEVELLED DRAB WHO THERE DOTH SCRATCH HERSELF WITH FILTHY NAILS AND CROUCHES NOW AND NOW ON FOOT IS STANDING
SITTETH PESCHIERA FORTRESS FAIR AND STRONG TO FRONT THE BRESCIANS AND THE BERGAMASKS WHERE ROUND ABOUT THE BANK DESCENDETH LOWEST THERE OF NECESSITY MUST FALL WHATEVER IN BOSOM OF BENACO CANNOT STAY AND GROWS A RIVER DOWN THROUGH VERDANT PASTURES
AND TRULY MY SAVAGE WIFE MORE THAN AUGHT ELSE DOTH HARM ME COULD I HAVE BEEN PROTECTED FROM THE FIRE
NOR PETER NOR THE REST ASKED OF MATTHIAS SILVER OR GOLD WHEN HE BY LOT WAS CHOSEN UNTO THE PLACE THE GUILTY SOUL HAD LOST THEREFORE STAY HERE FOR THOU ART JUSTLY PUNISHED
THEN SAID TO ME THE MASTER SO THAT FULL EXPERIENCE OF THIS ROUND THOU BEAR AWAY NOW GO AND SEE WHAT THEIR CONDITION IS THERE LET THY CONVERSATION BE CONCISE TILL THOU RETURNEST I WILL SPEAK WITH HIM THAT HE CONCEDE TO US HIS STALWART SHOULDERS
AND ON THAT SIDE HAS ALL THE HAIRY SKIN WAS MANTO WHO MADE QUEST THROUGH MANY LANDS AFTERWARDS TARRIED THERE WHERE I WAS BORN WHEREOF I WOULD THOU LIST TO ME A LITTLE AFTER HER FATHER HAD FROM LIFE DEPARTED
THENCE WE HEARD PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING MOAN IN THE NEXT BOLGIA SNORTING WITH THEIR MUZZLES AND WITH THEIR PALMS BEATING UPON THEMSELVES THE MARGINS WERE INCRUSTED WITH A MOULD BY EXHALATION FROM BELOW THAT STICKS THERE AND WITH THE EYES AND NOSTRILS WAGES WAR
AND THAT EXTENDED LIKE AN EEL HE MOVED AND WITH HIS PAWS DREW TO HIMSELF THE AIR A GREATER FEAR I DO NOT THINK THERE WAS WHAT TIME ABANDONED PHAETON THE REINS WHEREBY THE HEAVENS AS STILL APPEARS WERE SCORCHED
ALL OF ONE SIZE AND EVERY ONE WAS ROUND TO ME LESS AMPLE SEEMED THEY NOT NOR GREATER THAN THOSE THAT IN MY BEAUTIFUL SAINT JOHN ARE FASHIONED FOR THE PLACE OF THE BAPTISERS AND ONE OF WHICH NOT MANY YEARS AGO I BROKE FOR SOME ONE WHO WAS DROWNING IN IT
THERE TENDERLY HE LAID HIS BURDEN DOWN TENDERLY ON THE CRAG UNEVEN AND STEEP THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD PASSAGE FOR THE GOATS THENCE WAS UNVEILED TO ME ANOTHER VALLEY
I FOLLOWED HIM AND LITTLE HAD WE GONE BEFORE THE SOUND OF WATER WAS SO NEAR US THAT SPEAKING WE SHOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN HEARD EVEN AS THAT STREAM WHICH HOLDETH ITS OWN COURSE THE FIRST FROM MONTE VESO TOW'RDS THE EAST
WISDOM SUPREME O HOW GREAT ART THOU SHOWEST IN HEAVEN IN EARTH AND IN THE EVIL WORLD AND WITH WHAT JUSTICE DOTH THY POWER DISTRIBUTE I SAW UPON THE SIDES AND ON THE BOTTOM THE LIVID STONE WITH PERFORATIONS FILLED
WHO BY HIS HEART AND CUNNING THE COLCHIANS OF THE RAM MADE DESTITUTE HE BY THE ISLE OF LEMNOS PASSED ALONG AFTER THE DARING WOMEN PITILESS HAD UNTO DEATH DEVOTED ALL THEIR MALES THERE WITH HIS TOKENS AND WITH ORNATE WORDS DID HE DECEIVE HYPSIPYLE
THEN SAID HE TO ME HE WHO FROM THE CHEEK THRUSTS OUT HIS BEARD UPON HIS SWARTHY SHOULDERS WAS AT THE TIME WHEN GREECE WAS VOID OF MALES SO THAT THERE SCARCE REMAINED ONE IN THE CRADLE AN AUGUR AND WITH CALCHAS GAVE THE MOMENT IN AULIS
I DO NOT KNOW IF I WERE HERE TOO BOLD THAT HIM I ANSWERED ONLY IN THIS METRE I PRAY THEE TELL ME NOW HOW GREAT A TREASURE OUR LORD DEMANDED OF SAINT PETER FIRST BEFORE HE PUT THE KEYS INTO HIS KEEPING TRULY HE NOTHING ASKED BUT FOLLOW ME
COMING AT THE PACE WHICH IN THIS WORLD THE LITANIES ASSUME AS LOWER DOWN MY SIGHT DESCENDED ON THEM WONDROUSLY EACH ONE SEEMED TO BE DISTORTED FROM CHIN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CHEST FOR TOW'RDS THE REINS THE COUNTENANCE WAS TURNED
UNWILLINGLY I TELL IT BUT FORCES ME THINE UTTERANCE DISTINCT WHICH MAKES ME RECOLLECT THE ANCIENT WORLD I WAS THE ONE WHO THE FAIR GHISOLA INDUCED TO GRANT THE WISHES OF THE MARQUIS HOWE'ER THE SHAMELESS STORY MAY BE TOLD
NOR WHEN THE WRETCHED ICARUS HIS FLANKS FELT STRIPPED OF FEATHERS BY THE MELTING WAX
AND SO MAY THY RENOWN SHINE AFTER THEE VALOUR AND COURTESY SAY IF THEY DWELL WITHIN OUR CITY AS THEY USED TO DO OR IF THEY WHOLLY HAVE GONE OUT OF IT FOR GUGLIELMO BORSIER WHO IS IN TORMENT
WITH US OF LATE AND GOES THERE WITH HIS COMRADES DOTH GREATLY MORTIFY US WITH HIS WORDS THE NEW INHABITANTS AND THE SUDDEN GAINS PRIDE AND EXTRAVAGANCE HAVE IN THEE ENGENDERED FLORENCE SO THAT THOU WEEP'ST THEREAT ALREADY
YE WHO THE THINGS OF GOD WHICH OUGHT TO BE THE BRIDES OF HOLINESS RAPACIOUSLY FOR SILVER AND FOR GOLD DO PROSTITUTE NOW IT BEHOVES FOR YOU THE TRUMPET SOUND BECAUSE IN THIS THIRD BOLGIA YE ABIDE
THUS SPEAKING AT THY WILL THEREFORE IF THOU ESCAPE FROM THESE DARK PLACES AND COME TO REBEHOLD THE BEAUTEOUS STARS WHEN IT SHALL PLEASURE THEE TO SAY I WAS SEE THAT THOU SPEAK OF US UNTO THE PEOPLE
AND IN LIFE MUCH DID HE WITH HIS WISDOM AND HIS SWORD THE OTHER WHO CLOSE BY ME TREADS THE SAND TEGGHIAIO ALDOBRANDI IS WHOSE FAME ABOVE THERE IN THE WORLD SHOULD WELCOME BE AND I WHO WITH THEM ON THE CROSS AM PLACED JACOPO RUSTICUCCI WAS
WHO NOW UNTO HIS LEATHER AND HIS THREAD WOULD FAIN HAVE STUCK BUT HE TOO LATE REPENTS BEHOLD THE WRETCHED ONES WHO LEFT THE NEEDLE THE SPOOL AND ROCK AND MADE THEM FORTUNE TELLERS THEY WROUGHT THEIR MAGIC SPELLS WITH HERB AND IMAGE
OF THE FIRST SONG WHICH IS OF THE SUBMERGED I WAS ALREADY THOROUGHLY DISPOSED TO PEER DOWN INTO THE UNCOVERED DEPTH WHICH BATHED ITSELF WITH TEARS OF AGONY AND PEOPLE SAW I THROUGH THE CIRCULAR VALLEY SILENT AND WEEPING
HE WHO SHALL BRING THE SATCHEL WITH THREE GOATS THEN TWISTED HE HIS MOUTH AND FORTH HE THRUST HIS TONGUE LIKE TO AN OX THAT LICKS ITS NOSE AND FEARING LEST MY LONGER STAY MIGHT VEX HIM WHO HAD WARNED ME NOT TO TARRY LONG BACKWARD I TURNED ME FROM THOSE WEARY SOULS
AND THOU'RT ALESSIO INTERMINEI OF LUCCA THEREFORE I EYE THEE MORE THAN ALL THE OTHERS AND HE THEREON BELABOURING HIS PUMPKIN THE FLATTERIES HAVE SUBMERGED ME HERE BELOW WHEREWITH MY TONGUE WAS NEVER SURFEITED
BEHOLD GUIDO BONATTI
BUT ON THE BORDER DID NOT DRAG ITS TAIL THE FACE WAS AS THE FACE OF A JUST MAN ITS SEMBLANCE OUTWARDLY WAS SO BENIGN AND OF A SERPENT ALL THE TRUNK BESIDE TWO PAWS IT HAD HAIRY UNTO THE ARMPITS
WHILE SPEAKING IN THIS MANNER WITH HIS SCOURGE A DEMON SMOTE HIM
SO THAT MY ESCORT SAID TO ME ART THOU TOO OF THE OTHER FOOLS HERE PITY LIVES WHEN IT IS WHOLLY DEAD
IT WAS NOT CLEAR IF HE WERE CLERK OR LAYMAN HE SCREAMED TO ME WHEREFORE ART THOU SO EAGER TO LOOK AT ME MORE THAN THE OTHER FOUL ONES AND I TO HIM BECAUSE IF I REMEMBER I HAVE ALREADY SEEN THEE WITH DRY HAIR
IT MUST NEEDS BE SOME NOVELTY RESPOND I SAID WITHIN MYSELF TO THE NEW SIGNAL THE MASTER WITH HIS EYE IS FOLLOWING SO AH ME HOW VERY CAUTIOUS MEN SHOULD BE WITH THOSE WHO NOT ALONE BEHOLD THE ACT BUT WITH THEIR WISDOM LOOK INTO THE THOUGHTS
BECAUSE YOUR AVARICE AFFLICTS THE WORLD TRAMPLING THE GOOD AND LIFTING THE DEPRAVED THE EVANGELIST YOU PASTORS HAD IN MIND WHEN SHE WHO SITTETH UPON MANY WATERS TO FORNICATE WITH KINGS BY HIM WAS SEEN
AND YE A HUNDRED WORSHIP AH CONSTANTINE OF HOW MUCH ILL WAS MOTHER NOT THY CONVERSION BUT THAT MARRIAGE DOWER WHICH THE FIRST WEALTHY FATHER TOOK FROM THEE AND WHILE I SANG TO HIM SUCH NOTES AS THESE
EITHER THAT ANGER OR THAT CONSCIENCE STUNG HIM HE STRUGGLED VIOLENTLY WITH BOTH HIS FEET I THINK IN SOOTH THAT IT MY LEADER PLEASED WITH SUCH CONTENTED LIP HE LISTENED EVER
EVEN SUCH BECAME I AT THOSE PROFFERED WORDS BUT SHAME IN ME HIS MENACES PRODUCED WHICH MAKETH SERVANT STRONG BEFORE GOOD MASTER I SEATED ME UPON THOSE MONSTROUS SHOULDERS I WISHED TO SAY AND YET THE VOICE CAME NOT AS I BELIEVED
THE GUIDE SAID WAIT AND SEE THAT ON THEE STRIKE THE VISION OF THOSE OTHERS EVIL BORN OF WHOM THOU HAST NOT YET BEHELD THE FACES BECAUSE TOGETHER WITH US THEY HAVE GONE FROM THE OLD BRIDGE WE LOOKED UPON THE TRAIN WHICH TOW'RDS US CAME UPON THE OTHER BORDER
A MAN SHOULD CLOSE HIS LIPS AS FAR AS MAY BE BECAUSE WITHOUT HIS FAULT IT CAUSES SHAME BUT HERE I CANNOT AND READER BY THE NOTES OF THIS MY COMEDY TO THEE I SWEAR SO MAY THEY NOT BE VOID OF LASTING FAVOUR ATHWART THAT DENSE AND DARKSOME ATMOSPHERE
BY MANY YEARS THE RECORD LIED TO ME ART THOU SO EARLY SATIATE WITH THAT WEALTH FOR WHICH THOU DIDST NOT FEAR TO TAKE BY FRAUD THE BEAUTIFUL LADY AND THEN WORK HER WOE SUCH I BECAME AS PEOPLE ARE WHO STAND NOT COMPREHENDING WHAT IS ANSWERED THEM
THUS WHEELING ROUND DID EVERY ONE HIS VISAGE DIRECT TO ME SO THAT IN OPPOSITE WISE HIS NECK AND FEET CONTINUAL JOURNEY MADE AND IF THE MISERY OF THIS SOFT PLACE BRING IN DISDAIN OURSELVES AND OUR ENTREATIES BEGAN ONE AND OUR ASPECT BLACK AND BLISTERED
BUT I PERCEIVE IT ONLY BY WIND UPON MY FACE AND FROM BELOW I HEARD ALREADY ON THE RIGHT THE WHIRLPOOL MAKING A HORRIBLE CRASHING UNDER US WHENCE I THRUST OUT MY HEAD WITH EYES CAST DOWNWARD THEN WAS I STILL MORE FEARFUL OF THE ABYSS
LOWERING HIS FACE BUT LITTLE IT AVAILED HIM FOR SAID I THOU THAT CASTEST DOWN THINE EYES IF FALSE ARE NOT THE FEATURES WHICH THOU BEAREST THOU ART VENEDICO CACCIANIMICO BUT WHAT DOTH BRING THEE TO SUCH PUNGENT SAUCES AND HE TO ME
AS TO LOOK FORWARD HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM PERCHANCE INDEED BY VIOLENCE OF PALSY SOME ONE HAS BEEN THUS WHOLLY TURNED AWRY BUT I NE'ER SAW IT NOR BELIEVE IT CAN BE AS GOD MAY LET THEE READER GATHER FRUIT FROM THIS THY READING
WHEN SHADOWS THREE TOGETHER STARTED FORTH RUNNING FROM OUT A COMPANY THAT PASSED BENEATH THE RAIN OF THE SHARP MARTYRDOM TOWARDS US CAME THEY AND EACH ONE CRIED OUT STOP THOU FOR BY THY GARB TO US THOU SEEMEST TO BE SOME ONE OF OUR DEPRAVED CITY
THEREFORE WITH BOTH HIS ARMS HE TOOK ME UP AND WHEN HE HAD ME ALL UPON HIS BREAST REMOUNTED BY THE WAY WHERE HE DESCENDED NOR DID HE TIRE TO HAVE ME CLASPED TO HIM BUT BORE ME TO THE SUMMIT OF THE ARCH WHICH FROM THE FOURTH DIKE TO THE FIFTH IS PASSAGE
WHO CRUELLY WERE BEATING THEM BEHIND AH ME HOW THEY DID MAKE THEM LIFT THEIR LEGS AT THE FIRST BLOWS AND SOOTH NOT ANY ONE THE SECOND WAITED FOR NOR FOR THE THIRD WHILE I WAS GOING ON MINE EYES BY ONE ENCOUNTERED WERE AND STRAIGHT I SAID
AMONG THE MARBLES WHITE A CAVERN HAD FOR HIS ABODE WHENCE TO BEHOLD THE STARS AND SEA THE VIEW WAS NOT CUT OFF FROM HIM AND SHE THERE WHO IS COVERING UP HER BREASTS WHICH THOU BEHOLDEST NOT WITH LOOSENED TRESSES
THEN THEY BROKE UP THE WHEEL AND IN THEIR FLIGHT IT SEEMED AS IF THEIR AGILE LEGS WERE WINGS NOT AN AMEN COULD POSSIBLY BE SAID SO RAPIDLY AS THEY HAD DISAPPEARED WHEREFORE THE MASTER DEEMED BEST TO DEPART
THE BOTTOM IS SO DEEP NO PLACE SUFFICES TO GIVE US SIGHT OF IT
AS SOMETIMES WHERRIES LIE UPON THE SHORE THAT PART ARE IN THE WATER PART ON LAND AND AS AMONG THE GUZZLING GERMANS THERE THE BEAVER PLANTS HIMSELF TO WAGE HIS WAR SO THAT VILE MONSTER LAY UPON THE BORDER WHICH IS OF STONE AND SHUTTETH IN THE SAND
WITHOUT OTHER OMEN ITS PEOPLE ONCE WITHIN MORE CROWDED WERE ERE THE STUPIDITY OF CASALODI FROM PINAMONTE HAD RECEIVED DECEIT THEREFORE I CAUTION THEE IF E'ER THOU HEAREST ORIGINATE MY CITY OTHERWISE NO FALSEHOOD MAY THE VERITY DEFRAUD
AND TRULY WAS I SON OF THE SHE BEAR SO EAGER TO ADVANCE THE CUBS THAT WEALTH ABOVE AND HERE MYSELF I POCKETED BENEATH MY HEAD THE OTHERS ARE DRAGGED DOWN WHO HAVE PRECEDED ME IN SIMONY FLATTENED ALONG THE FISSURE OF THE ROCK
DOWN AT THE BOTTOM WERE THE SINNERS NAKED THIS SIDE THE MIDDLE CAME THEY FACING US BEYOND IT WITH US BUT WITH GREATER STEPS EVEN AS THE ROMANS FOR THE MIGHTY HOST THE YEAR OF JUBILEE UPON THE BRIDGE HAVE CHOSEN A MODE TO PASS THE PEOPLE OVER
I JOINED MYSELF AGAIN UNTO MINE ESCORT THEREAFTERWARD WITH FOOTSTEPS FEW WE CAME TO WHERE A CRAG PROJECTED FROM THE BANK THIS VERY EASILY DID WE ASCEND AND TURNING TO THE RIGHT ALONG ITS RIDGE FROM THOSE ETERNAL CIRCLES WE DEPARTED
SOON AS THE WATER DOTH BEGIN TO RUN NO MORE BENACO IS IT CALLED BUT MINCIO FAR AS GOVERNO WHERE IT FALLS IN PO NOT FAR IT RUNS BEFORE IT FINDS A PLAIN IN WHICH IT SPREADS ITSELF AND MAKES IT MARSHY
AND THE GOOD MASTER YET FROM OFF HIS HAUNCH DEPOSED ME NOT TILL TO THE HOLE HE BROUGHT ME OF HIM WHO SO LAMENTED WITH HIS SHANKS WHOE'ER THOU ART THAT STANDEST UPSIDE DOWN O DOLEFUL SOUL IMPLANTED LIKE A STAKE TO SAY BEGAN I
AS SOON AS WE STOOD STILL THEY RECOMMENCED THE OLD REFRAIN AND WHEN THEY OVERTOOK US FORMED OF THEMSELVES A WHEEL ALL THREE OF THEM AS CHAMPIONS STRIPPED AND OILED ARE WONT TO DO WATCHING FOR THEIR ADVANTAGE AND THEIR HOLD BEFORE THEY COME TO BLOWS AND THRUSTS BETWEEN THEM
THUS FARTHER STILL UPON THE OUTERMOST HEAD OF THAT SEVENTH CIRCLE ALL ALONE I WENT WHERE SAT THE MELANCHOLY FOLK OUT OF THEIR EYES WAS GUSHING FORTH THEIR WOE THIS WAY THAT WAY THEY HELPED THEM WITH THEIR HANDS NOW FROM THE FLAMES AND NOW FROM THE HOT SOIL
BUT I PERCEIVED THAT FROM THE NECK OF EACH THERE HUNG A POUCH WHICH CERTAIN COLOUR HAD AND CERTAIN BLAZON AND THEREUPON IT SEEMS THEIR EYES ARE FEEDING AND AS I GAZING ROUND ME COME AMONG THEM UPON A YELLOW POUCH I AZURE SAW THAT HAD THE FACE AND POSTURE OF A LION
BUT COME NOW FOR ALREADY HOLDS THE CONFINES OF BOTH THE HEMISPHERES AND UNDER SEVILLE TOUCHES THE OCEAN WAVE CAIN AND THE THORNS AND YESTERNIGHT THE MOON WAS ROUND ALREADY THOU SHOULDST REMEMBER WELL IT DID NOT HARM THEE FROM TIME TO TIME WITHIN THE FOREST DEEP
MORE THAN HIS OTHER COMRADES QUIVERING I SAID AND WHOM A REDDER FLAME IS SUCKING AND HE TO ME IF THOU WILT HAVE ME BEAR THEE DOWN THERE ALONG THAT BANK WHICH LOWEST LIES
AND I MY MASTER THY DISCOURSES ARE TO ME SO CERTAIN AND SO TAKE MY FAITH THAT UNTO ME THE REST WOULD BE SPENT COALS BUT TELL ME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PASSING IF ANY ONE NOTE WORTHY THOU BEHOLDEST FOR ONLY UNTO THAT MY MIND REVERTS
IF THOU CANST SPEAK OUT I STOOD EVEN AS THE FRIAR WHO IS CONFESSING THE FALSE ASSASSIN WHO WHEN HE IS FIXED RECALLS HIM SO THAT DEATH MAY BE DELAYED AND HE CRIED OUT DOST THOU STAND THERE ALREADY
AND AS ABOUT SUCH STRONGHOLDS FROM THEIR GATES UNTO THE OUTER BANK ARE LITTLE BRIDGES SO FROM THE PRECIPICE'S BASE DID CRAGS PROJECT WHICH INTERSECTED DIKES AND MOATS UNTO THE WELL THAT TRUNCATES AND COLLECTS THEM
AS SOON AS THIS MY LORD SAID UNTO ME WORDS ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH I THOUGHT WITHIN ME THAT PEOPLE SUCH AS YOU ARE WERE APPROACHING I OF YOUR CITY AM AND EVERMORE YOUR LABOURS AND YOUR HONOURABLE NAMES I WITH AFFECTION HAVE RETRACED AND HEARD
LET THE RENOWN OF US THY MIND INCLINE TO TELL US WHO THOU ART WHO THUS SECURELY THY LIVING FEET DOST MOVE ALONG THROUGH HELL HE IN WHOSE FOOTPRINTS THOU DOST SEE ME TREADING NAKED AND SKINLESS THOUGH HE NOW MAY GO WAS OF A GREATER RANK THAN THOU DOST THINK
WE THEREFORE ON THE RIGHT SIDE DESCENDED AND MADE TEN STEPS UPON THE OUTER VERGE COMPLETELY TO AVOID THE SAND AND FLAME AND AFTER WE ARE COME TO HIM I SEE A LITTLE FARTHER OFF UPON THE SAND A PEOPLE SITTING NEAR THE HOLLOW PLACE
AFTER I THIS HAD ALL FROM ME UNLOOSED AS MY CONDUCTOR HAD COMMANDED ME I REACHED IT TO HIM GATHERED UP AND COILED WHEREAT HE TURNED HIMSELF TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE VERGE HE CAST IT DOWN INTO THAT DEEP ABYSS
THITHER WE CAME AND THENCE DOWN IN THE MOAT I SAW A PEOPLE SMOTHERED IN A FILTH THAT OUT OF HUMAN PRIVIES SEEMED TO FLOW AND WHILST BELOW THERE WITH MINE EYE I SEARCH I SAW ONE WITH HIS HEAD SO FOUL WITH ORDURE
WHO FEELS COMPASSION AT THE DOOM DIVINE LIFT UP LIFT UP THY HEAD AND SEE FOR WHOM OPENED THE EARTH BEFORE THE THEBANS EYES WHEREFORE THEY ALL CRIED WHITHER RUSHEST THOU AMPHIARAUS WHY DOST LEAVE THE WAR
AS IF BEMOCKED AND KNOW NOT HOW TO ANSWER THEN SAID VIRGILIUS SAY TO HIM STRAIGHTWAY I AM NOT HE I AM NOT HE THOU THINKEST AND I REPLIED AS WAS IMPOSED ON ME
ALREADY WITH SIGHT OF THIS ONE I AM NOT UNFED THEREFORE I STAYED MY FEET TO MAKE HIM OUT AND WITH ME THE SWEET GUIDE CAME TO A STAND AND TO MY GOING SOMEWHAT BACK ASSENTED
WHEN TO SEVER THE FIRST CABLE ERYPHYLUS HIS NAME WAS AND SO SINGS MY LOFTY TRAGEDY IN SOME PART OR OTHER THAT KNOWEST THOU WELL WHO KNOWEST THE WHOLE OF IT THE NEXT WHO IS SO SLENDER IN THE FLANKS WAS MICHAEL SCOTT
THINK NOW FOR THYSELF HOW I COULD EVER KEEP MY FACE UNMOISTENED WHEN OUR OWN IMAGE NEAR ME I BEHELD DISTORTED SO THE WEEPING OF THE EYES ALONG THE FISSURE BATHED THE HINDER PARTS TRULY I WEPT LEANING UPON A PEAK OF THE HARD CRAG
HAVE I GREAT GRATITUDE FROM THEE
IN THIS WISE I EXCLAIMED WITH FACE UPLIFTED AND THE THREE TAKING THAT FOR MY REPLY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AS ONE LOOKS AT TRUTH IF OTHER TIMES SO LITTLE IT DOTH COST THEE REPLIED THEY ALL TO SATISFY ANOTHER HAPPY ART THOU
AND THE CITY OF BACCHUS HAD BECOME ENSLAVED SHE A LONG SEASON WANDERED THROUGH THE WORLD ABOVE IN BEAUTEOUS ITALY LIES A LAKE AT THE ALP'S FOOT THAT SHUTS IN GERMANY OVER TYROL AND HAS THE NAME BENACO
THE MAIDEN WHO FIRST HERSELF HAD ALL THE REST DECEIVED THERE DID HE LEAVE HER PREGNANT AND FORLORN SUCH SIN UNTO SUCH PUNISHMENT CONDEMNS HIM AND ALSO FOR MEDEA IS VENGEANCE DONE
AND WHICH THE SCOURGES IN LIKE MANNER SMITE AND THE GOOD MASTER WITHOUT MY INQUIRING SAID TO ME SEE THAT TALL ONE WHO IS COMING AND FOR HIS PAIN SEEMS NOT TO SHED A TEAR STILL WHAT A ROYAL ASPECT HE RETAINS THAT JASON IS
AND OFT TIS WONT IN SUMMER TO BE SICKLY PASSING THAT WAY THE VIRGIN PITILESS LAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FEN DESCRIED UNTILLED AND NAKED OF INHABITANTS THERE TO ESCAPE ALL HUMAN INTERCOURSE SHE WITH HER SERVANTS STAYED HER ARTS TO PRACTISE AND LIVED
WHICH IS ABOVE CALLED ACQUACHETA ERE IT DOWN DESCENDETH INTO ITS LOW BED AND AT FORLI IS VACANT OF THAT NAME REVERBERATES THERE ABOVE SAN BENEDETTO FROM ALPS BY FALLING AT A SINGLE LEAP WHERE FOR A THOUSAND THERE WERE ROOM ENOUGH
PROCEEDING THEN THE CURRENT OF MY SIGHT ANOTHER OF THEM SAW I RED AS BLOOD DISPLAY A GOOSE MORE WHITE THAN BUTTER IS AND ONE WHO WITH AN AZURE SOW AND GRAVID EMBLAZONED HAD HIS LITTLE POUCH OF WHITE SAID UNTO ME WHAT DOST THOU IN THIS MOAT
NOT THE SOLE BOLOGNESE AM I WHO WEEPS HERE NAY RATHER IS THIS PLACE SO FULL OF THEM THAT NOT SO MANY TONGUES TO DAY ARE TAUGHT TWIXT RENO AND SAVENA TO SAY SIPA AND IF THEREOF THOU WISHEST PLEDGE OR PROOF BRING TO THY MIND OUR AVARICIOUS HEART
THE CIRCLES LARGE AND THE DESCENT BE LITTLE THINK OF THE NOVEL BURDEN WHICH THOU HAST EVEN AS THE LITTLE VESSEL SHOVES FROM SHORE BACKWARD STILL BACKWARD SO HE THENCE WITHDREW AND WHEN HE WHOLLY FELT HIMSELF AFLOAT THERE WHERE HIS BREAST HAD BEEN HE TURNED HIS TAIL
THEN SIGHING WITH A VOICE OF LAMENTATION SAID TO ME THEN WHAT WANTEST THOU OF ME IF WHO I AM THOU CAREST SO MUCH TO KNOW THAT THOU ON THAT ACCOUNT HAST CROSSED THE BANK KNOW THAT I VESTED WAS WITH THE GREAT MANTLE
AND LEFT HER EMPTY BODY THERE THE MEN THEREAFTER WHO WERE SCATTERED ROUND COLLECTED IN THAT PLACE WHICH WAS MADE STRONG BY THE LAGOON IT HAD ON EVERY SIDE THEY BUILT THEIR CITY OVER THOSE DEAD BONES AND AFTER HER WHO FIRST THE PLACE SELECTED MANTUA NAMED IT
HIS TAIL WAS WHOLLY QUIVERING IN THE VOID CONTORTING UPWARDS THE ENVENOMED FORK THAT IN THE GUISE OF SCORPION ARMED ITS POINT THE GUIDE SAID NOW PERFORCE MUST TURN ASIDE OUR WAY A LITTLE
BECAUSE I FIRES BEHELD AND HEARD LAMENTS WHEREAT I TREMBLING ALL THE CLOSER CLING I SAW THEN FOR BEFORE I HAD NOT SEEN IT THE TURNING AND DESCENDING BY GREAT HORRORS THAT WERE APPROACHING UPON DIVERS SIDES
WHEN FROM A MALE A FEMALE HE BECAME HIS MEMBERS BEING ALL OF THEM TRANSFORMED AND AFTERWARDS WAS FORCED TO STRIKE ONCE MORE THE TWO ENTANGLED SERPENTS WITH HIS ROD ERE HE COULD HAVE AGAIN HIS MANLY PLUMES
TAKE HEED THAT THOU EMBRACE ME BUT HE WHO OTHER TIMES HAD RESCUED ME IN OTHER PERIL SOON AS I HAD MOUNTED WITHIN HIS ARMS ENCIRCLED AND SUSTAINED ME
THEY WOULD HAVE SNAPPED ASUNDER WITHES AND BANDS EVEN AS THE FLAME OF UNCTUOUS THINGS IS WONT TO MOVE UPON THE OUTER SURFACE ONLY SO LIKEWISE WAS IT THERE FROM HEEL TO POINT MASTER WHO IS THAT ONE WHO WRITHES HIMSELF
FOR AFTER HIM SHALL COME OF FOULER DEED FROM TOW'RDS THE WEST A PASTOR WITHOUT LAW SUCH AS BEFITS TO COVER HIM AND ME NEW JASON WILL HE BE OF WHOM WE READ IN MACCABEES AND AS HIS KING WAS PLIANT SO HE WHO GOVERNS FRANCE SHALL BE TO THIS ONE
BUT AS I SHOULD HAVE BURNED AND BAKED MYSELF MY TERROR OVERMASTERED MY GOOD WILL WHICH MADE ME GREEDY OF EMBRACING THEM THEN I BEGAN SORROW AND NOT DISDAIN DID YOUR CONDITION FIX WITHIN ME SO THAT TARDILY IT WHOLLY IS STRIPPED OFF
AS FAR AS MINOS WHO LAYS HOLD ON ALL SEE HE HAS MADE A BOSOM OF HIS SHOULDERS BECAUSE HE WISHED TO SEE TOO FAR BEFORE HIM BEHIND HE LOOKS AND BACKWARD GOES HIS WAY
WITH HIM GO THOSE WHO IN SUCH WISE DECEIVE AND THIS SUFFICIENT BE OF THE FIRST VALLEY TO KNOW AND THOSE THAT IN ITS JAWS IT HOLDS WE WERE ALREADY WHERE THE NARROW PATH CROSSES ATHWART THE SECOND DIKE
AND HAS DISTINCT IN VALLEYS TEN ITS BOTTOM AS WHERE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE WALLS MANY AND MANY MOATS SURROUND THE CASTLES THE PART IN WHICH THEY ARE A FIGURE FORMS JUST SUCH AN IMAGE THOSE PRESENTED THERE
AH ME WHAT WOUNDS I SAW UPON THEIR LIMBS RECENT AND ANCIENT BY THE FLAMES BURNT IN IT PAINS ME STILL BUT TO REMEMBER IT UNTO THEIR CRIES MY TEACHER PAUSED ATTENTIVE HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS ME AND NOW WAIT
I FOUND MY GUIDE WHO HAD ALREADY MOUNTED UPON THE BACK OF THAT WILD ANIMAL AND SAID TO ME NOW BE BOTH STRONG AND BOLD NOW WE DESCEND BY STAIRWAYS SUCH AS THESE MOUNT THOU IN FRONT FOR I WILL BE MIDWAY SO THAT THE TAIL MAY HAVE NO POWER TO HARM THEE
NOT OTHERWISE IN SUMMER DO THE DOGS NOW WITH THE FOOT NOW WITH THE MUZZLE WHEN BY FLEAS OR FLIES OR GADFLIES THEY ARE BITTEN WHEN I HAD TURNED MINE EYES UPON THE FACES OF SOME ON WHOM THE DOLOROUS FIRE IS FALLING NOT ONE OF THEM I KNEW
THE BACK AND BREAST AND BOTH THE SIDES IT HAD DEPICTED O'ER WITH NOOSES AND WITH SHIELDS WITH COLOURS MORE GROUNDWORK OR BROIDERY NEVER IN CLOTH DID TARTARS MAKE NOR TURKS NOR WERE SUCH TISSUES BY ARACHNE LAID
HE SAID TO THESE WE SHOULD BE COURTEOUS
THE SAME WHO WITH THE SEVEN HEADS WAS BORN AND POWER AND STRENGTH FROM THE TEN HORNS RECEIVED SO LONG AS VIRTUE TO HER SPOUSE WAS PLEASING YE HAVE MADE YOURSELVES A GOD OF GOLD AND SILVER AND FROM THE IDOLATER HOW DIFFER YE SAVE THAT HE ONE
WHERE I BOUGHT A SHIP READY FITTED FOR SEA
FOR HE WAS METAMORPHOSED INTO A BLACK STONE AS HE IS TO BE SEEN IN THIS PALACE AND THE QUEEN MY MOTHER HAD THE LIKE DESTINY I AM THE ONLY PERSON WHO DID NOT SUFFER UNDER THAT HEAVY JUDGMENT
AND EVER SINCE I HAVE CONTINUED TO SERVE GOD WITH MORE FERVENCY THAN BEFORE I AM PERSUADED DEAR LADY THAT HE HAS SENT YOU HITHER FOR MY COMFORT FOR WHICH I RENDER HIM INFINITE THANKS FOR I MUST OWN
IT SEEMS SO BUT IF THE BAD WERE TO ATTAIN THE GOOD WHICH IS THEIR OBJECT THEY COULD NOT BE BAD NO
WHICH WAS INESTIMABLE IN VALUE WERE IT ONLY FOR THE DIAMOND I MENTIONED THE DOORS BEING ALL OPEN OR BUT HALF SHUT I SURVEYED SOME OTHER APARTMENTS THAT WERE AS BEAUTIFUL AS THOSE I HAD ALREADY SEEN
IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DARE VENTURE A SECOND TIME YOU KNOW HOW RARE IT IS TO MEET WITH A HUSBAND PERFECTLY VIRTUOUS AND DESERVING BELIEVE WHAT I SAY AND LET US LIVE TOGETHER AS COMFORTABLY AS WE CAN
BRING WITH THEM ANYTHING OF SUCH SORT AS SEEMS TO HAVE NOTHING WANTING TO IT THAT IS GOOD WE TOO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME ARE MADE HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF THESE THINGS BUT IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FULFIL THEIR PROMISES AND MOREOVER
MY TEARS TESTIFY WITH HOW MUCH SORROW AND RELUCTANCE
AND THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT GRATIFYING MY CURIOSITY IN THE MEAN TIME NIGHT CAME ON WHICH REMINDED ME THAT IT WAS TIME TO RETIRE I PROPOSED TO RETURN THE WAY I HAD ENTERED BUT I COULD NOT FIND IT
IN A MANNER ANSWERABLE TO OUR CONDITION BUT I ADDED I RATHER BELIEVE YOU WISH TO MARRY AGAIN I SHALL FEEL MUCH SURPRISED IF SUCH BE THE CASE AFTER THE EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE HAD OF THE LITTLE SATISFACTION THERE IS IN WEDLOCK
WHEREAS IF THERE BE NO POWER THE WILL IS ALL IN VAIN AND SO IF THOU SEEST ANY MAN WISHING TO ATTAIN SOME END YET UTTERLY FAILING TO ATTAIN IT THOU CANST NOT DOUBT THAT HE LACKED THE POWER OF GETTING WHAT HE WISHED FOR
I CONCLUDED IT TO BE THE QUEEN'S APARTMENTS I ENTERED AND IN A LARGE HALL I FOUND SEVERAL BLACK EUNUCHS TURNED INTO STONE I WENT FROM THENCE INTO A ROOM RICHLY FURNISHED
AND ASKED HER WHO SHE WAS I AM SAID SHE THE SERPENT WHOM YOU LATELY DELIVERED FROM MY MORTAL ENEMY
THE NAME OF THE OTHER IS SAFIE AND MY OWN ZOBEIDE AFTER OUR FATHER'S DEATH THE PROPERTY THAT HE LEFT WAS EQUALLY DIVIDED AMONG US AND
AND MAY HE BE GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO PROTECT US IN THE SAME MANNER
HE ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND WE CONVERSED THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT CONCERNING OUR EMBARKATION AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY WE LEFT THE PALACE
WILL GIVE YOU FULL INFORMATION IN THE RELATION OF HER STORY AFTER THE CALIPH HAD HEARD ZOBEIDE WITH MUCH ASTONISHMENT
I SOON DRIED MY CLOTHES IN THE SUN AND AS I WALKED ALONG I FOUND SEVERAL KINDS OF FRUIT AND LIKEWISE FRESH WATER WHICH GAVE ME SOME HOPES OF PRESERVING MY LIFE I HAD JUST LAID MYSELF DOWN TO REST IN A SHADE
WE CONTINUED THUS A WHOLE YEAR IN PERFECT LOVE AND HARMONY SEEING THAT GOD HAD INCREASED MY SMALL STOCK I PROJECTED A VOYAGE TO EMBARK SOME OF IT IN A COMMERCIAL SPECULATION TO THIS END
JUDGE WHAT WAS MY SURPRISE WHEN I AWOKE TO SEE STANDING BY ME A BLACK WOMAN OF LIVELY AND AGREEABLE FEATURES WHO HELD IN HER HAND TWO BITCHES OF THE SAME COLOUR FASTENED TOGETHER I SAT UP
SORROW HIS SPIRIT VEXES SORE AND EMPTY HOPES DELUDE
AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH WE PERCEIVED A GREAT TOWN HAVING A FRESH GALE WE SOON REACHED THE HARBOUR AND CAST ANCHOR I HAD NOT PATIENCE TO WAIT TILL MY SISTERS WERE DRESSED TO GO ALONG WITH ME BUT WENT ASHORE ALONE IN THE BOAT
WHICH I HIT UPON THE HEAD AND KILLED THE OTHER FINDING ITSELF AT LIBERTY TOOK WING AND FLEW AWAY I LOOKED AFTER IT FOR SOME TIME TILL IT DISAPPEARED I THEN SOUGHT ANOTHER SHADY SPOT FOR REPOSE AND FELL ASLEEP
VERILY WONDROUS GREAT ARE THY PROMISES YET I DO NOT DOUBT BUT THOU CANST MAKE THEM GOOD ONLY KEEP ME NOT IN SUSPENSE AFTER RAISING SUCH HOPES LEARN THEN FIRST SAID SHE HOW THAT POWER EVER WAITS UPON THE GOOD
I TOOK HER TO A BATH CLOTHED HER WITH MY OWN APPAREL AND THUS ADDRESSED HER SISTER YOU ARE THE ELDER AND I ESTEEM YOU AS MY MOTHER DURING YOUR ABSENCE GOD HAS BLEST THE PORTION THAT FELL TO MY SHARE
AND THEY HAD ALL SUCH DREADFUL COUNTENANCES THAT I WAS GREATLY ALARMED BUT PERCEIVING THEY REMAINED STATIONARY AND DID NOT SO MUCH AS MOVE THEIR EYES I TOOK COURAGE AND WENT NEARER WHEN I FOUND THEY WERE ALL TURNED INTO STONES
AND LIFTING UP MY HEAD SAW A DIAMOND AS LARGE AS THE EGG OF AN OSTRICH LYING UPON A LOW STOOL IT WAS SO PURE THAT I COULD NOT FIND THE LEAST BLEMISH IN IT AND IT SPARKLED WITH SO MUCH BRILLIANCY
WHO CAN VENTURE TO DENY IT YET HE WOULD NOT UNLESS HE POSSESSED THE MONEY WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE NO HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT
I LOST MYSELF AMONG THE APARTMENTS AND PERCEIVING I WAS COME BACK AGAIN TO THE LARGE ROOM WHERE THE THRONE THE COUCH THE LARGE DIAMOND AND THE TORCHES STOOD I RESOLVED TO TAKE MY NIGHT'S LODGING THERE AND TO DEPART THE NEXT MORNING EARLY
AND THE YOUNG PRINCE WHOM THEY HAVE DROWNED I WAS FORCED TO PROMISE OBEDIENCE SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE WHIPPED THEM EVERY NIGHT THOUGH WITH REGRET WHEREOF YOUR MAJESTY HAS BEEN A WITNESS
THE ABILITY TO COMMIT CRIME CANNOT BE REFERRED TO THE GOOD THEREFORE IT IS NOT A THING TO BE DESIRED AND YET ALL POWER IS DESIRABLE IT IS CLEAR THEN THAT ABILITY TO DO EVIL IS NOT POWER
BUT SINCE I SEE THEE SO READY AT UNDERSTANDING I WILL HEAP PROOF ON PROOF LOOK HOW MANIFEST IS THE EXTREMITY OF VICIOUS MEN'S WEAKNESS THEY CANNOT EVEN REACH THAT GOAL TO WHICH THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS AND ALMOST CONSTRAINS THEM
YOU MUST KNOW THAT THIS CITY WAS THE METROPOLIS OF A MIGHTY KINGDOM OVER WHICH THE SULTAN MY FATHER REIGNED THAT PRINCE HIS WHOLE COURT THE INHABITANTS OF THE CITY AND ALL HIS OTHER SUBJECTS
I APPROACHED IN HOPES TO FIND SOME
INSTEAD OF WHICH IN A WAY OTHER THAN IS AGREEABLE TO ITS NATURE IT I WILL NOT SAY FULFILS ITS FUNCTION BUT FEIGNS TO FULFIL IT WHICH OF THESE TWO WOULD IN THY VIEW BE THE STRONGER I GUESS THY MEANING BUT I PRAY THEE
THE BAD HAVE AN ABILITY NOR DO I WISH TO DENY IT ONLY THIS ABILITY OF THEIRS COMES NOT FROM STRENGTH BUT FROM IMPOTENCE FOR THEIR ABILITY IS TO DO EVIL
THE SHIP I CAME IN MAY SERVE IN SOME MEASURE TO CONVINCE YOU
MY VESSEL IS AT YOUR SERVICE
WHICH STOOD OPEN A CURTAIN OF SILK STUFF SEEMED TO BE DRAWN BEFORE IT A LAMP HUNG OVER THE ENTRANCE AFTER I HAD SURVEYED THE BUILDING I MADE NO DOUBT BUT IT WAS THE PALACE OF THE PRINCE WHO REIGNED OVER THAT COUNTRY
READING WITH GREAT DEVOTION THE KORAUN WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM ON A DESK AT THIS SIGHT I WAS TRANSPORTED WITH ADMIRATION I WONDERED HOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT HE SHOULD BE THE ONLY LIVING CREATURE
AND HANGING OUT ITS TONGUE WHICH INDUCED ME TO CONCLUDE IT HAD RECEIVED SOME INJURY I INSTANTLY AROSE AND PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS PURSUED BY A LARGER SERPENT WHICH HAD HOLD OF ITS TAIL AND WAS ENDEAVOURING TO DEVOUR IT
SHE DELIVERED TO ME THE TWO BITCHES AND SAID IF YOU WOULD NOT BE CHANGED INTO A SIMILAR FORM I COMMAND YOU IN THE NAME OF HIM THAT GOVERNS THE SEA TO GIVE EACH OF YOUR SISTERS EVERY NIGHT ONE HUNDRED LASHES WITH A ROD
AS SOON AS THESE TWO SISTERS RECEIVED THEIR PORTIONS THEY LEFT ME TO LIVE WITH THEIR MOTHER MY OTHER TWO SISTERS AND MYSELF STAYED WITH OUR MOTHER WHO WAS THEN ALIVE AND WHO WHEN SHE AFTERWARDS DIED
THE ABSENCE OF THE OTHER ADMITTED BUT A MAN LACKS THAT OF WHICH HE IS IN WANT HE DOES
I STOOD SOME TIME ADMIRING THE RICHES AND MAGNIFICENCE OF THE ROOM BUT ABOVE ALL
WHEN I HAD DONE I PRAYED HIM TO PERFORM HIS PROMISE AND TOLD HIM HOW MUCH I WAS STRUCK BY THE FRIGHTFUL DESOLATION WHICH I HAD SEEN IN THE CITY LADY SAID THE YOUNG MAN HAVE PATIENCE FOR A MOMENT
AFTER WE HAD LADEN THE VESSEL WITH WHAT WE THOUGHT MOST DESIRABLE WE TOOK SUCH PROVISIONS AND WATER ABOARD AS WERE NECESSARY FOR OUR VOYAGE
IS IT FROM IGNORANCE OF WHAT IS GOOD WELL WHAT IS MORE WEAK AND FEEBLE THAN THE BLINDNESS OF IGNORANCE DO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY OUGHT TO FOLLOW BUT LUST DRIVES THEM ASIDE OUT OF THE WAY IF IT BE SO THEY ARE STILL FRAIL BY REASON OF THEIR INCONTINENCE
THEN WE HAVE WORKED ROUND TO AN OPPOSITE CONCLUSION THE WEALTH WHICH WAS THOUGHT TO MAKE A MAN INDEPENDENT RATHER PUTS HIM IN NEED OF FURTHER PROTECTION HOW IN THE WORLD THEN
AS SOON AS I WAS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING IT SHE EXPLAINED TO ME ALL THE PASSAGES OF THIS EXCELLENT BOOK AND INFUSED PIETY INTO MY MIND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER OR ANY OTHER PERSON SHE HAPPENED TO DIE
FOR I AM THE YOUNGEST MARRIED AND LEFT ME ALONE SOME TIME AFTER MY ELDEST SISTER'S HUSBAND SOLD ALL THAT HE HAD AND WITH THAT MONEY AND MY SISTER'S PORTION THEY WENT BOTH INTO AFRICA WHERE HER HUSBAND
AND AT LAST CAME INTO A LARGE ROOM WHERE THERE WAS A THRONE OF MASSIVE GOLD
OF COURSE NOT THEN IN RESPECT OF WHAT HE CAN ACCOMPLISH A MAN IS TO BE RECKONED STRONG IN RESPECT OF WHAT HE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WEAK GRANTED SAID I THEN DOST THOU REMEMBER THAT BY OUR FORMER REASONINGS
AND TWO CANDLESTICKS WITH LARGE TAPERS OF WHITE WAX BURNING I SAW A LITTLE CARPET LAID DOWN LIKE THOSE WE HAVE TO KNEEL UPON WHEN WE SAY OUR PRAYERS AND A COMELY YOUNG MAN SAT ON THIS CARPET
TO GET ABOARD MY SHIP I LAID MYSELF DOWN UPON A COUCH NOT WITHOUT SOME DREAD TO BE ALONE IN A DESOLATE PLACE AND THIS FEAR HINDERED MY SLEEP ABOUT MIDNIGHT
WHILE THE BAD ARE LEFT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH
FOR REFLECT WHETHER MEN ARE ABLE TO WIN HAPPINESS BY THOSE MEANS THROUGH WHICH THEY THINK TO REACH THE PROPOSED END TRULY IF EITHER WEALTH RANK OR ANY OF THE REST
TO HINDER ITS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THOSE WHO POSSESS IT AGAINST THEIR WILL I ADMIT IT WHY OF COURSE WHEN EVERY DAY THE STRONGER WRESTS IT FROM THE WEAKER WITHOUT HIS CONSENT ELSE WHENCE COME LAWSUITS
THE WORDS WERE THESE INHABITANTS ABANDON THE WORSHIP OF NARDOUN AND OF FIRE AND WORSHIP THE ONLY GOD WHO SHEWS MERCY THIS VOICE WAS HEARD THREE YEARS SUCCESSIVELY BUT NO ONE WAS CONVERTED
WERE MAGI WORSHIPPERS OF FIRE AND OF NARDOUN THE ANCIENT KING OF THE GIANTS WHO REBELLED AGAINST GOD BUT THOUGH I WAS BORN OF AN IDOLATROUS FATHER AND MOTHER I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE IN MY YOUTH TO HAVE A GOVERNESS
BY RIOTOUS LIVING AND DEBAUCHERY SPENT ALL AND FINDING HIMSELF REDUCED TO POVERTY FOUND A PRETEXT FOR DIVORCING MY SISTER
WITH ONE INDISTINGUISHABLE PURPOSE STRIVE TO REACH GOOD YES THAT FOLLOWS BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT BY THE ATTAINMENT OF GOOD MEN BECOME GOOD IT IS THEN DO THE GOOD ATTAIN THEIR OBJECT
FOR SINCE GOOD AND EVIL ARE CONTRARIES IF IT IS MADE PLAIN THAT GOOD IS POWER THE FEEBLENESS OF EVIL IS CLEARLY SEEN AND CONVERSELY IF THE FRAIL NATURE OF EVIL IS MADE MANIFEST THE STRENGTH OF GOOD IS THEREBY KNOWN
WHOM I HAVE TRANSFORMED INTO THIS SHAPE BUT THIS PUNISHMENT WILL NOT SUFFICE AND MY WILL IS THAT YOU TREAT THEM HEREAFTER
AND WHY I ALONE AM SAFE IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A TERRIBLE DISASTER I TOLD HIM IN A FEW WORDS WHENCE I HAD COME WHAT HAD MADE ME UNDERTAKE THE VOYAGE AND HOW I SAFELY ARRIVED AT THE PORT AFTER TWENTY DAYS SAILING
AND I DARE ENGAGE TO PROMISE YOU SANCTUARY THERE UNTIL THE MIGHTY COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL
AT LAST WE SET SAIL WITH A WIND AS FAVOURABLE AS WE COULD WISH THE YOUNG PRINCE MY SISTERS AND MYSELF ENJOYED OURSELVES FOR SOME TIME VERY AGREEABLY BUT ALAS THIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING DID NOT LAST LONG
WHEREAS THE BAD TRY TO ATTAIN THIS SAME GOOD THROUGH ALL MANNER OF CONCUPISCENCE WHICH IS NOT THE NATURAL WAY OF ATTAINING GOOD OR DOST THOU THINK OTHERWISE NAY RATHER ONE FURTHER CONSEQUENCE IS CLEAR TO ME
FOR MY SISTERS GREW JEALOUS OF THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE PRINCE AND MYSELF AND MALICIOUSLY ASKED ME ONE DAY WHAT WE SHOULD DO WITH HIM WHEN WE CAME TO BAGDAD I PERCEIVED IMMEDIATELY
AND HOW FOR AVARICE NOTHING IS ENOUGH WHEREFORE IF WEALTH CANNOT GET RID OF WANT AND MAKES NEW WANTS OF ITS OWN
AFTER THE SAME MANNER AND IN THE SAME TONE AS IT IS READ IN OUR MOSQUES BEING EXTREMELY GLAD TO HEAR IT I IMMEDIATELY AROSE AND TAKING A TORCH IN MY HAND PASSED FROM ONE CHAMBER TO ANOTHER
NO ONE BUT THE GUARDS IN THE VESTIBULE ALL PETRIFIED SOME STANDING SOME SITTING AND SOME LYING I CAME TO A LARGE COURT WHERE I SAW BEFORE ME A STATELY BUILDING THE WINDOWS OF WHICH WERE INCLOSED WITH GATES OF MESSY GOLD
THE SEAMEN WERE TAKEN UP SEVERAL DAYS IN UNLADING THE MERCHANDIZE I BROUGHT WITH ME AND EMBARKING
AND TO RESIGN MYSELF WHOLLY TO YOUR COMMANDS THE PRINCE REPLIED I KNOW NOT MADAM WHETHER YOU BE IN JEST OR NO BUT FOR MY PART I SERIOUSLY DECLARE BEFORE THESE LADIES YOUR SISTERS
I ENTERED THE TOWN AND PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL STREETS WHERE AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS STOOD MEN IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES BUT ALL MOTIONLESS AND PETRIFIED IN THE QUARTER INHABITED BY THE MERCHANTS
SEE HIS PILES OF GOLD RISE HIGH THOUGH HE GATHER STORE OF TREASURE THAT CAN NEVER SATISFY THOUGH WITH PEARLS HIS GORGET BLAZES RAREST THAT THE OCEAN YIELDS THOUGH A HUNDRED HEAD OF OXEN TRAVAIL IN HIS AMPLE FIELDS
AT THESE WORDS HE SHUT THE KORAUN PUT IT INTO A RICH CASE AND LAID IT IN THE NICHE
BUT WHICH THEY CANNOT WIN OR HOLD NAY THEIR FAILURE CONCERNS THE VERY SUM AND CROWN OF THINGS POOR WRETCHES THEY FAIL TO COMPASS EVEN THAT FOR WHICH THEY TOIL DAY AND NIGHT
FOR IF THIS EVER GAPING EVER CRAVING WANT IS GLUTTED BY WEALTH IT NEEDS MUST BE THAT THE WANT ITSELF WHICH CAN BE SO GLUTTED STILL REMAINS I DO NOT SPEAK OF HOW VERY LITTLE SUFFICES FOR NATURE
AND THE EMPLOYMENT I FOLLOW OF BREEDING SILK WORMS ASSURE YOURSELF THERE IS NOTHING I HAVE BUT IS AT YOUR SERVICE AND AS MUCH AT YOUR DISPOSAL AS MY OWN WE LIVED VERY COMFORTABLY TOGETHER FOR SOME MONTHS
TOLD ME THEY INTENDED TO MARRY AGAIN I OBSERVED THAT IF PUTTING ME TO EXPENSE WAS THE ONLY REASON THEY MIGHT LAY THOSE THOUGHTS ASIDE AND BE WELCOME TO REMAIN FOR WHAT I HAD WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN US ALL THREE
THE DOOR BEING ONLY HALF SHUT I OPENED IT WENT IN AND STANDING UPRIGHT BEFORE THE NICHE I REPEATED THIS PRAYER ALOUD PRAISE BE TO GOD WHO HAS FAVOURED US WITH A HAPPY VOYAGE
HER HUSBAND HAD TREATED HER AFTER THE SAME MANNER AND I RECEIVED HER LIKEWISE WITH THE SAME AFFECTION AS I HAD DONE THE FORMER SOME TIME AFTER MY TWO SISTERS
FOR IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED SEVERAL VESSELS MORE TO CONVEY TO BAGDAD
WHO SO ATTAINS THE END OF HIS DESIRES THAT NOTHING FURTHER TO BE DESIRED LIES BEYOND WHENCE FOLLOWS THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THEY WHO ARE WICKED ARE SEEN LIKEWISE TO BE WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH FOR WHY DO THEY FORSAKE VIRTUE AND FOLLOW VICE
WE SET SAIL WITH A FAIR WIND AND SOON CLEARED THE PERSIAN GULF WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE OPEN SEA WE STEERED OUR COURSE TO THE INDIES AND THE TWENTIETH DAY SAW LAND IT WAS A VERY HIGH MOUNTAIN
THAT WE SHOULD ASSERT THAT THE BAD WHO FORM THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND DO NOT EXIST BUT THE FACT IS SO I DO NOT INDEED DENY THAT THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE BAD BUT THAT THEY ARE IN AN UNQUALIFIED AND ABSOLUTE SENSE I DENY
CANNOT MAKE ITS POSSESSOR INDEPENDENT AND FREE FROM ALL WANT YET THIS WAS WHAT IT SEEMED TO PROMISE MOREOVER I THINK THIS ALSO WELL DESERVES TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE SPECIAL NATURE OF MONEY
THE IMPORTANT SERVICES YOU HAVE RENDERED ME THAN BY WHAT I HAVE JUST DONE THE TREACHERY OF YOUR SISTERS WAS WELL KNOWN TO ME AND TO AVENGE YOUR WRONGS AS SOON AS I WAS LIBERATED BY YOUR GENEROUS ASSISTANCE
IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE WHOLE AIM OF MAN'S WILL THOUGH THE MEANS OF PURSUIT VARY IS SET INTENTLY UPON HAPPINESS I DO REMEMBER THAT THIS TOO WAS PROVED DOST THOU ALSO CALL TO MIND HOW HAPPINESS IS ABSOLUTE GOOD
HOWEVER IT MADE ME IMAGINE THAT THERE WAS SOME LIVING CREATURE IN THIS PLACE FOR I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TORCHES CONTINUED THUS BURNING OF THEMSELVES SEVERAL OTHER RARITIES DETAINED MY CURIOSITY IN THIS ROOM
HEAR ME O LORD AND GRANT MY REQUEST THE YOUNG MAN TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS ME AND SAID MY GOOD LADY PRAY LET ME KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT HAS BROUGHT YOU TO THIS DESOLATE CITY
THAT NOTHING HAS MORE POWER THAN SUPREME GOOD WE DID SAID I BUT THAT SAME HIGHEST GOOD CANNOT DO EVIL CERTAINLY NOT IS THERE ANYONE THEN WHO THINKS THAT MEN ARE ABLE TO DO ALL THINGS NONE BUT A MADMAN
AFTER I HAD PRESENTED MY SISTERS TO THE PRINCE I TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HINDERED MY RETURN THE DAY BEFORE HOW I HAD MET WITH THE YOUNG PRINCE HIS STORY AND THE CAUSE OF THE DESOLATION OF SO FINE A CITY
I FOUND MOST OF THE SHOPS SHUT AND IN SUCH AS WERE OPEN I LIKEWISE FOUND THE PEOPLE PETRIFIED HAVING REACHED A VAST SQUARE IN THE HEART OF THE CITY I PERCEIVED A LARGE FOLDING GATE COVERED WITH PLATES OF GOLD
BUT ABUNDANTLY MORE WISE THAN WE IF YOU WILL VOUCHSAFE TO RECEIVE US ONCE MORE INTO YOUR HOUSE AND ACCOUNT US YOUR SLAVES WE SHALL NEVER COMMIT A SIMILAR FAULT AGAIN MY ANSWER WAS DEAR SISTERS
FOR THEY CANNOT FIGHT AGAINST VICE OR DO THEY KNOWINGLY AND WILFULLY FORSAKE THE GOOD AND TURN ASIDE TO VICE WHY AT THIS RATE THEY NOT ONLY CEASE TO HAVE POWER BUT CEASE TO BE AT ALL FOR THEY WHO FORSAKE THE COMMON END OF ALL THINGS THAT ARE
THAT THEY PUT THIS QUESTION ON PURPOSE TO DISCOVER MY INCLINATIONS THEREFORE RESOLVING TO PUT IT OFF WITH A JEST I ANSWERED I WILL TAKE HIM FOR MY HUSBAND AND UPON THAT TURNING MYSELF TO THE PRINCE SAID
AND PERCEIVING IN HIM SO MUCH GOOD NATURE AND BEAUTY I FELT EMOTIONS I HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE HE MADE ME SIT DOWN BY HIM AND BEFORE HE BEGAN HIS DISCOURSE I COULD NOT FORBEAR SAYING WITH AN AIR THAT DISCOVERED THE SENTIMENTS I FELT
AS WE WERE ONE DAY CONVERSING ABOUT OUR THIRD SISTER AND WONDERING WE RECEIVED NO INTELLIGENCE OF HER
YET IN SOME WISE NOTWITHSTANDING YE DISCERN THE TRUE END OF HAPPINESS AND SO THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS YOU THITHER TO THAT TRUE GOOD WHILE ERROR IN MANY FORMS LEADS YOU ASTRAY THEREFROM
BUT NOT BEFORE SHE HAD PERFECTLY INSTRUCTED ME IN ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY TO CONVINCE ME OF THE TRUTH OF THE MOOSULMAUN RELIGION AFTER HER DEATH I PERSISTED WITH CONSTANCY IN THE BELIEF OF ITS DIVINITY
I HAVE NOT ALTERED MY MIND WITH RESPECT TO YOU SINCE WE LAST PARTED COME AGAIN AND TAKE PART OF WHAT I HAVE UPON THIS I EMBRACED THEM AND WE LIVED TOGETHER AS BEFORE
HOWEVER TO WIN AMPLER CREDENCE FOR MY CONCLUSION I WILL PURSUE BOTH PATHS AND DRAW CONFIRMATION FOR MY STATEMENTS FIRST IN ONE WAY AND THEN IN THE OTHER THE CARRYING OUT OF ANY HUMAN ACTION DEPENDS UPON TWO THINGS
AND PROVED TO BE A FLAT ON THE COAST WHICH WHEN DAY APPEARED I FOUND TO BE A DESERT ISLAND
AND UPON THE THRONE THERE WAS A BED OF RICH STUFF EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS WHAT SURPRISED ME MOST WAS A SPARKLING LIGHT WHICH CAME FROM ABOVE THE BED BEING CURIOUS TO KNOW WHENCE IT PROCEEDED I ASCENDED THE STEPS
CAN WANT BE DRIVEN AWAY BY RICHES CANNOT THE RICH FEEL HUNGER CANNOT THEY THIRST ARE NOT THE LIMBS OF THE WEALTHY SENSITIVE TO THE WINTER'S COLD BUT THOU WILT SAY
THE OTHER ATTAIN IT NOT IS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT THE GOOD ARE ENDUED WITH POWER WHILE THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE WEAK IF ANY DOUBT IT HE IS INCAPABLE OF REFLECTING ON THE NATURE OF THINGS OR THE CONSEQUENCES INVOLVED IN REASONING
SIR I HUMBLY BEG OF YOU TO GIVE YOUR CONSENT FOR AS SOON AS WE COME TO BAGDAD I DESIRE TO OFFER YOU MY PERSON TO BE YOUR SLAVE
WAS THY MIND NEVER TROUBLED IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME WRONG DONE TO THEE NAY SAID I
THE WISE ALONE ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY WOULD WHILE THE WICKED FOLLOW THEIR OWN HEARTS LUST BUT CAN NOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY WOULD FOR THEY GO ON IN THEIR WILFULNESS
WHY CERTAINLY NOT THERE IS NO DENYING IT CANST THOU THEN DOUBT THAT HE WHOM THOU SEEST TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT HE WILLED
FOR FROM MY ADMISSIONS IT MUST NEEDS FOLLOW THAT THE GOOD HAVE POWER AND THE BAD ARE IMPOTENT THOU ANTICIPATEST RIGHTLY AND THAT AS PHYSICIANS RECKON IS A SIGN THAT NATURE IS SET WORKING
LACK MANY GOOD THINGS IS NOT THE HAPPINESS MEN SEEK IN THEM CLEARLY DISCOVERED TO BE A FALSE SHOW THEREFORE DO I FIRST ASK THEE THYSELF WHO BUT LATELY WERT LIVING IN AFFLUENCE AMID ALL THAT ABUNDANCE OF WEALTH
AND IN THIS YOUR MAJESTY MAY SEE I AM MORE TO BE PITIED THAN BLAMED IF THERE BE ANY THING ELSE RELATING TO MYSELF
THE RICH HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO SATE THEIR HUNGER THE MEANS TO GET RID OF THIRST AND COLD TRUE ENOUGH WANT CAN THUS BE SOOTHED BY RICHES WHOLLY REMOVED IT CANNOT BE
I RECEIVED HER WITH EVERY POSSIBLE TENDERNESS AND INQUIRING INTO THE CAUSE OF HER DISTRESS SHE TOLD ME WITH TEARS HOW INHUMANLY HER HUSBAND HAD BEHAVED TOWARDS HER HER MISFORTUNES AFFECTED ME AND I MINGLED MY TEARS WITH HERS
SUCH AS JEWELS GOLD AND MONEY WE LEFT THE FURNITURE AND GOODS WHICH CONSISTED OF AN INFINITE QUANTITY OF PLATE
ON THAT SIDE FROM WHENCE THE SOUND PROCEEDED I CAME TO THE CLOSET DOOR AND STOOD STILL NOT DOUBTING THAT IT CAME FROM THENCE I SET DOWN MY TORCH UPON THE GROUND
THAT THIS SOLITARY LIFE IS EXTREMELY IRKSOME ALL THESE EXPRESSIONS AND PARTICULARLY THE LAST GREATLY INCREASED MY LOVE FOR HIM PRINCE SAID I THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT PROVIDENCE HAS BROUGHT ME INTO YOUR PORT TO AFFORD YOU AN OPPORTUNITY
YOU PREFER A BLUESTOCKING IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL MISS ALDEN HER SISTER TELLS ME SAID PERCY BEAUMONT THAT SHE IS TREMENDOUSLY LITERARY I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
THAT'S A GREAT PITY SAID BEAUMONT YOU WOULD FIND IT ALL SET FORTH THERE SO MUCH BETTER THAN I CAN DO IT HE IS A PEER THEN OH YES HE IS A PEER AND HAS HE ANY OTHER TITLE THAN LORD LAMBETH
AND HE DISCOVERED FOR HIMSELF THAT THE YOUNG LADY WAS CLEVER AND APPEARED TO HAVE READ A GREAT DEAL SHE SEEMED VERY NICE THOUGH HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT AS MISSUS WESTGATE HAD SAID SHE WAS SHY
AND A CONVULSIVE MOTION AGITATED ITS LIMBS HOW CAN I DESCRIBE MY EMOTIONS AT THIS CATASTROPHE OR HOW DELINEATE THE WRETCH WHOM WITH SUCH INFINITE PAINS AND CARE I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO FORM
AND HE HAD A STRONG INCORRUPTIBLE SENSE OF THE PROPRIETIES OF LIFE HIS KINSMAN MEANWHILE WAS HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF TALK WITH BESSIE ALDEN ON THE RED SEA ROCKS BEYOND THE LAWN
WE ASCENDED INTO MY ROOM AND THE SERVANT PRESENTLY BROUGHT BREAKFAST BUT I WAS UNABLE TO CONTAIN MYSELF IT WAS NOT JOY ONLY THAT POSSESSED ME
HAVE YOU GOT A CLERGYMAN THAT IS LOOKING OUT BUT SHE MADE HIM TELL HER THAT HE HAD A CASTLE HE CONFESSED TO BUT ONE IT WAS THE PLACE IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORN AND BROUGHT UP
AND HE ADDED THAT MISTER WESTGATE HAD SEEMED VERY UNEASY LEST HIS WIFE SHOULD MISS HER VISITOR HE HAD BEEN IN SUCH AN AWFUL HURRY TO SEND HIM BACK TO HER I'M AFRAID YOU'LL NEVER COME UP TO AN AMERICAN HUSBAND IF THAT'S WHAT THE WIVES EXPECT HE SAID TO LORD LAMBETH
SO THAT WHEN HIS FATHER DIES PURSUED BESSIE ALDEN WITH MORE SIMPLICITY THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN A CLEVER GIRL HE WILL BECOME DUKE OF BAYSWATER OF COURSE SAID PERCY BEAUMONT
MISSUS WESTGATE TELLS ME THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE FAST GIRL IN AMERICA THAT IT'S AN ENGLISH INVENTION AND THAT THE TERM HAS NO MEANING HERE ALL THE BETTER IT'S AN ANIMAL I DETEST
BUT HIS FATHER IS IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND HIS MOTHER BEAUMONT SMILED A LITTLE THE DUCHESS IS UNCOMMONLY ROBUST AND HAS HE ANY SISTERS YES THERE ARE TWO
OF EVENINGS AT OPEN WINDOWS OR ON THE PERPETUAL VERANDAS IN THE SUMMER STARLIGHT ABOVE THE WARM ATLANTIC THE YOUNG ENGLISHMEN WERE INTRODUCED TO EVERYBODY
CLERVAL AT FIRST ATTRIBUTED MY UNUSUAL SPIRITS TO JOY ON HIS ARRIVAL BUT WHEN HE OBSERVED ME MORE ATTENTIVELY HE SAW A WILDNESS IN MY EYES FOR WHICH HE COULD NOT ACCOUNT
I HAVE LATELY BEEN SO DEEPLY ENGAGED IN ONE OCCUPATION THAT I HAVE NOT ALLOWED MYSELF SUFFICIENT REST AS YOU SEE BUT I HOPE I SINCERELY HOPE THAT ALL THESE EMPLOYMENTS ARE NOW AT AN END
GOOD MORROW TO YOU MY GOOD LASS WHAT ARE YOU WEEPING FOR ALAS SAID SHE I MUST SPIN THIS STRAW INTO GOLD AND I KNOW NOT HOW WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME SAID THE HOBGOBLIN
AND MY LOUD UNRESTRAINED HEARTLESS LAUGHTER FRIGHTENED AND ASTONISHED HIM MY DEAR VICTOR CRIED HE WHAT FOR GOD'S SAKE IS THE MATTER DO NOT LAUGH IN THAT MANNER HOW ILL YOU ARE
HIS POSITION PERCY BEAUMONT REPEATED HIS RANK OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T GOT A PEERAGE LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THACKERAY
HE PERFORMED THE KINDEST ACTION THAT HE COULD TOWARDS THEM BUT I WAS IN REALITY VERY ILL AND SURELY NOTHING BUT THE UNBOUNDED AND UNREMITTING ATTENTIONS OF MY FRIEND COULD HAVE RESTORED ME TO LIFE
SHE HAS BEEN ASKING ME SAID BEAUMONT ALL ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR POSSESSIONS I AM SURE IT IS VERY GOOD OF HER LORD LAMBETH REJOINED WELL THEN OBSERVED HIS COMPANION IF YOU GO YOU GO WITH YOUR EYES OPEN
HOW KIND HOW VERY GOOD YOU ARE TO ME THIS WHOLE WINTER INSTEAD OF BEING SPENT IN STUDY AS YOU PROMISED YOURSELF HAS BEEN CONSUMED IN MY SICK ROOM HOW SHALL I EVER REPAY YOU
AND AS SOON AS HER LITTLE FRIEND CAME SHE SAT DOWN UPON HER THRONE AND CALLED ALL HER COURT ROUND TO ENJOY THE FUN AND THE NURSE STOOD BY HER SIDE WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS AS IF IT WAS QUITE READY TO BE GIVEN UP
AND ALL THOSE SCENES OF HOME SO DEAR TO MY RECOLLECTION I GRASPED HIS HAND AND IN A MOMENT FORGOT MY HORROR AND MISFORTUNE I FELT SUDDENLY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING MANY MONTHS CALM AND SERENE JOY
ENTERTAINED BY EVERYBODY INTIMATE WITH EVERYBODY AT THE END OF THREE DAYS THEY HAD REMOVED THEIR LUGGAGE FROM THE HOTEL AND HAD GONE TO STAY WITH MISSUS WESTGATE
THIS YOUNG LADY NO LONGER APPLIED TO PERCY BEAUMONT FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING HIS LORDSHIP SHE ADDRESSED HERSELF DIRECTLY TO THE YOUNG NOBLEMAN SHE ASKED HIM A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS SOME OF WHICH BORED HIM A LITTLE
THEN SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO AND SAT DOWN ONCE MORE TO WEEP BUT THE DWARF SOON OPENED THE DOOR AND SAID WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME TO DO YOUR TASK THE RING ON MY FINGER SAID SHE
BUT I HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS A REASONABLE YOUNG MAN AND I CAN GIVE NO BETTER PROOF OF IT THAN THE FACT THAT HE REMARKED TO HIS COMPANION AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT AFTER ALL I AM VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HER
I DID NOT BEFORE REMARK HOW VERY ILL YOU APPEAR SO THIN AND PALE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HAD BEEN WATCHING FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS YOU HAVE GUESSED RIGHT
AND ARE HIS PARENTS LIVING OH YES IF HIS FATHER WERE NOT LIVING HE WOULD BE A DUKE
IT STOPPED JUST WHERE I WAS STANDING AND ON THE DOOR BEING OPENED I PERCEIVED HENRY CLERVAL WHO ON SEEING ME INSTANTLY SPRUNG OUT MY DEAR FRANKENSTEIN EXCLAIMED HE HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU
PACING THEM WITH QUICK STEPS AS IF I SOUGHT TO AVOID THE WRETCH WHOM I FEARED EVERY TURNING OF THE STREET WOULD PRESENT TO MY VIEW I DID NOT DARE RETURN TO THE APARTMENT WHICH I INHABITED BUT FELT IMPELLED TO HURRY ON
LISTENING ATTENTIVELY CATCHING AND FEARING EACH SOUND AS IF IT WERE TO ANNOUNCE THE APPROACH OF THE DEMONIACAL CORPSE TO WHICH I HAD SO MISERABLY GIVEN LIFE OH NO MORTAL COULD SUPPORT THE HORROR OF THAT COUNTENANCE
THE CHAMBER DOOR WAS LOCKED AND SHE WAS LEFT ALONE SHE SAT DOWN IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO BEWAIL HER HARD FATE WHEN ON A SUDDEN THE DOOR OPENED AND A DROLL LOOKING LITTLE MAN HOBBLED IN AND SAID
AND DISCOVERED TO MY SLEEPLESS AND ACHING EYES THE CHURCH OF INGOLSTADT ITS WHITE STEEPLE AND CLOCK WHICH INDICATED THE SIXTH HOUR THE PORTER OPENED THE GATES OF THE COURT WHICH HAD THAT NIGHT BEEN MY ASYLUM AND I ISSUED INTO THE STREETS
IT MEANS HE SAID THAT YOUR FATHER IS LAID UP I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'S ANYTHING SERIOUS BUT YOU HAVE NO OPTION TAKE THE FIRST STEAMER BUT DON'T BE ALARMED
I AFTERWARDS LEARNED THAT KNOWING MY FATHER'S ADVANCED AGE AND UNFITNESS FOR SO LONG A JOURNEY AND HOW WRETCHED MY SICKNESS WOULD MAKE ELIZABETH HE SPARED THEM THIS GRIEF BY CONCEALING THE EXTENT OF MY DISORDER
HIS WIFE MORE THAN ONCE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE EXPECTED HIM ON THE MORROW BUT ON THE MORROW SHE WANDERED ABOUT A LITTLE WITH A TELEGRAM IN HER JEWELED FINGERS DECLARING IT WAS VERY TIRESOME THAT HIS BUSINESS DETAINED HIM IN NEW YORK
COLERIDGE'S ANCIENT MARINER CONTINUING THUS I CAME AT LENGTH OPPOSITE TO THE INN AT WHICH THE VARIOUS DILIGENCES AND CARRIAGES USUALLY STOPPED HERE I PAUSED I KNEW NOT WHY
IF SHE WAS SHY SHE CARRIED IT OFF VERY WELL MISTER BEAUMONT SHE HAD SAID PLEASE TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT LORD LAMBETH'S FAMILY HOW WOULD YOU SAY IT IN ENGLAND HIS POSITION
AND WHEN HE HEARD THE MILLER'S BOAST HIS GREEDINESS WAS RAISED AND HE SENT FOR THE GIRL TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM THEN HE LED HER TO A CHAMBER IN HIS PALACE WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT HEAP OF STRAW AND GAVE HER A SPINNING WHEEL AND SAID
SO STRANGELY TURNED TO BITTERNESS BUT I WAS NOT THE WITNESS OF HIS GRIEF FOR I WAS LIFELESS AND DID NOT RECOVER MY SENSES FOR A LONG LONG TIME
NO MADAM IS IT TOM NO MADAM IS IT JEMMY IT IS NOT CAN YOUR NAME BE
DAMN MY EYES EXCLAIMED LORD LAMBETH IF ONE IS TO BE A DOZEN TIMES A DAY AT THE HOUSE IT IS A GREAT DEAL MORE CONVENIENT TO SLEEP THERE I AM SICK OF TRAVELING UP AND DOWN THIS BEASTLY AVENUE
BUT I REMAINED SOME MINUTES WITH MY EYES FIXED ON A COACH THAT WAS COMING TOWARDS ME FROM THE OTHER END OF THE STREET AS IT DREW NEARER I OBSERVED THAT IT WAS THE SWISS DILIGENCE
HER FEATURES APPEARED TO CHANGE AND I THOUGHT THAT I HELD THE CORPSE OF MY DEAD MOTHER IN MY ARMS A SHROUD ENVELOPED HER FORM AND I SAW THE GRAVE WORMS CRAWLING IN THE FOLDS OF THE FLANNEL I STARTED FROM MY SLEEP WITH HORROR
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT SO GREAT A GOOD FORTUNE COULD HAVE BEFALLEN ME BUT WHEN I BECAME ASSURED THAT MY ENEMY HAD INDEED FLED I CLAPPED MY HANDS FOR JOY AND RAN DOWN TO CLERVAL
I IMAGINED THAT THE MONSTER SEIZED ME I STRUGGLED FURIOUSLY AND FELL DOWN IN A FIT POOR CLERVAL WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN HIS FEELINGS A MEETING WHICH HE ANTICIPATED WITH SUCH JOY
ONLY TO BE FAIR HE ADDED YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD MY MOTHER ALSO THAT SHE IS NOT SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN ME PERCY BEAUMONT GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH THERE IS NOTHING SO CHARMING AS MODESTY IN A YOUNG MAN IN YOUR POSITION
FROM A HIGH POINT OF VIEW IT WOULD BE VERY INSPIRING THE LESS ONE THINKS OF IT THE BETTER LORD LAMBETH AFFIRMED I THINK IT'S TREMENDOUS SAID BESSIE ALDEN AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION SHE ASKED HIM IF HE HAD ANY TENANTRY
THE RAIN PATTERED DISMALLY AGAINST THE PANES AND MY CANDLE WAS NEARLY BURNT OUT WHEN BY THE GLIMMER OF THE HALF EXTINGUISHED LIGHT I SAW THE DULL YELLOW EYE OF THE CREATURE OPEN IT BREATHED HARD
BESSIE ALDEN APPEARED TO BE LOOKING AT HIM WITH INTEREST HE IS THE SON OF THE DUKE OF BAYSWATER HE ADDED PRESENTLY THE ELDEST SON THE ONLY SON
WITH AN ANXIETY THAT ALMOST AMOUNTED TO AGONY I COLLECTED THE INSTRUMENTS OF LIFE AROUND ME THAT I MIGHT INFUSE A SPARK OF BEING INTO THE LIFELESS THING THAT LAY AT MY FEET IT WAS ALREADY ONE IN THE MORNING
AND WHAT ARE THEY CALLED ONE OF THEM IS MARRIED SHE IS THE COUNTESS OF PIMLICO AND THE OTHER THE OTHER IS UNMARRIED SHE IS PLAIN LADY JULIA
HE KNEW THAT I COULD NOT HAVE A MORE KIND AND ATTENTIVE NURSE THAN HIMSELF AND FIRM IN THE HOPE HE FELT OF MY RECOVERY HE DID NOT DOUBT THAT INSTEAD OF DOING HARM
HEREUPON IT WAS THAT AS I HAVE SAID HE WAS A LITTLE BORED DO YOU WANT TO BUY UP THEIR LEASES HE ASKED WELL HAVE YOU GOT ANY LIVINGS SHE DEMANDED OH I SAY HE CRIED
OF UNIVERSAL FRIENDLINESS AND FRANKNESS OF OCCASIONS ON WHICH THEY KNEW EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING AND HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF EASE
THEN HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY OFF WHILE THE NURSE LAUGHED AND THE BABY CROWED AND ALL THE COURT JEERED AT HIM FOR HAVING HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE FOR NOTHING AND SAID
BESSIE ALDEN LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT IS SHE VERY PLAIN BEAUMONT BEGAN TO LAUGH AGAIN YOU WOULD NOT FIND HER SO HANDSOME AS HER BROTHER HE SAID
MERRILY I'LL DANCE AND SING FOR NEXT DAY WILL A STRANGER BRING LITTLE DOES MY LADY DREAM RUMPELSTILTSKIN IS MY NAME WHEN THE QUEEN HEARD THIS SHE JUMPED FOR JOY
TO EVERY ONE OF THEM MADAM THAT IS NOT MY NAME THE THIRD DAY ONE OF THE MESSENGERS CAME BACK AND SAID I HAVE TRAVELLED TWO DAYS WITHOUT HEARING OF ANY OTHER NAMES BUT YESTERDAY AS I WAS CLIMBING A HIGH HILL
AND HE MUTTERED SOME INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHILE A GRIN WRINKLED HIS CHEEKS HE MIGHT HAVE SPOKEN BUT I DID NOT HEAR ONE HAND WAS STRETCHED OUT SEEMINGLY TO DETAIN ME
HOW FORTUNATE THAT YOU SHOULD BE HERE AT THE VERY MOMENT OF MY ALIGHTING NOTHING COULD EQUAL MY DELIGHT ON SEEING CLERVAL HIS PRESENCE BROUGHT BACK TO MY THOUGHTS MY FATHER ELIZABETH
AND THAT I AM AT LENGTH FREE I TREMBLED EXCESSIVELY I COULD NOT ENDURE TO THINK OF AND FAR LESS TO ALLUDE TO THE OCCURRENCES OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT I WALKED WITH A QUICK PACE
BUT HE WAS ABSENT ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS DURING WHICH WITH MISTER WESTGATE'S ASSISTANCE HE COMPLETELY SETTLED THIS PIECE OF BUSINESS THEY CERTAINLY DO THINGS QUICKLY IN NEW YORK HE OBSERVED TO HIS COUSIN
BUT I ESCAPED AND RUSHED DOWNSTAIRS I TOOK REFUGE IN THE COURTYARD BELONGING TO THE HOUSE WHICH I INHABITED WHERE I REMAINED DURING THE REST OF THE NIGHT WALKING UP AND DOWN IN THE GREATEST AGITATION
AMERICAN LADIES CERTAINLY DON'T MIND CONTRADICTING YOU UPON MY WORD I DON'T THINK I WAS EVER TREATED SO BY A WOMAN BEFORE SHE'S SO DEVILISH POSITIVE
PERCY BEAUMONT RETURNED WITH HIS COUSIN AND HIS SENSE OF DUTY COMPELLED HIM ONE WINDLESS AFTERNOON IN MID ATLANTIC
REEL AWAY REEL AWAY STRAW INTO GOLD AND ROUND ABOUT THE WHEEL WENT MERRILY THE WORK WAS QUICKLY DONE AND THE STRAW WAS ALL SPUN INTO GOLD
THE FORM OF THE MONSTER ON WHOM I HAD BESTOWED EXISTENCE WAS FOREVER BEFORE MY EYES AND I RAVED INCESSANTLY CONCERNING HIM DOUBTLESS MY WORDS SURPRISED HENRY
ALL THIS MUST BE SPUN INTO GOLD BEFORE MORNING AS YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE IT WAS IN VAIN THAT THE POOR MAIDEN SAID THAT IT WAS ONLY A SILLY BOAST OF HER FATHER
THEN THE LITTLE MAN BEGAN TO CHUCKLE AT THE THOUGHT OF HAVING THE POOR CHILD TO TAKE HOME WITH HIM TO HIS HUT IN THE WOODS AND HE CRIED OUT NOW LADY WHAT IS MY NAME IS IT JOHN ASKED SHE
AND SHE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN WHILE SHE CONTINUED THAT SLOW PACED PROMENADE WHICH ENABLED HER WELL ADJUSTED SKIRTS TO DISPLAY THEMSELVES SO ADVANTAGEOUSLY THAT UNFORTUNATELY IN AMERICA THERE WAS NO LEISURE CLASS
LORD LAMBETH MADE HIS FAREWELLS BUT THE FEW LAST WORDS THAT HE EXCHANGED WITH BESSIE ALDEN ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE A PLACE IN OUR RECORD
AND WE SOON ARRIVED AT MY COLLEGE I THEN REFLECTED AND THE THOUGHT MADE ME SHIVER THAT THE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LEFT IN MY APARTMENT MIGHT STILL BE THERE ALIVE AND WALKING ABOUT
OF COURSE I NEEDN'T ASSURE YOU HE SAID THAT IF YOU SHOULD COME TO ENGLAND NEXT YEAR I EXPECT TO BE THE FIRST PERSON THAT YOU INFORM OF IT BESSIE ALDEN LOOKED AT HIM A LITTLE AND SHE SMILED
A MUMMY AGAIN ENDUED WITH ANIMATION COULD NOT BE SO HIDEOUS AS THAT WRETCH I HAD GAZED ON HIM WHILE UNFINISHED HE WAS UGLY THEN BUT WHEN THOSE MUSCLES AND JOINTS WERE RENDERED CAPABLE OF MOTION
HE AT FIRST BELIEVED THEM TO BE THE WANDERINGS OF MY DISTURBED IMAGINATION BUT THE PERTINACITY WITH WHICH I CONTINUALLY RECURRED TO THE SAME SUBJECT PERSUADED HIM THAT MY DISORDER INDEED OWED ITS ORIGIN TO SOME UNCOMMON AND TERRIBLE
WHAT AM I TO DO PERCY BEAUMONT WAS ANNOYED AS WELL HE HAD DEEMED IT HIS DUTY AS I HAVE NARRATED TO WRITE TO THE DUCHESS BUT HE HAD NOT EXPECTED THAT THIS DISTINGUISHED WOMAN WOULD ACT SO PROMPTLY UPON HIS HINT
AT OTHERS I NEARLY SANK TO THE GROUND THROUGH LANGUOR AND EXTREME WEAKNESS MINGLED WITH THIS HORROR I FELT THE BITTERNESS OF DISAPPOINTMENT
AND SINCE YOU APPEAR IN SUCH GOOD SPIRITS I MAY SPEAK TO YOU ON ONE SUBJECT MAY I NOT I TREMBLED ONE SUBJECT WHAT COULD IT BE
THOUGH IF IT WERE CONVENIENT I MIGHT PRESENT A RECORD OF IMPRESSIONS NONETHELESS DELECTABLE THAT THEY WERE NOT EXHAUSTIVELY ANALYZED MANY OF THEM STILL LINGER IN THE MINDS OF OUR TRAVELERS ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF HARMONIOUS IMAGES
BUT TELL ME HOW YOU LEFT MY FATHER BROTHERS AND ELIZABETH VERY WELL AND VERY HAPPY ONLY A LITTLE UNEASY THAT THEY HEAR FROM YOU SO SELDOM BY THE BY I MEAN TO LECTURE YOU A LITTLE UPON THEIR ACCOUNT MYSELF
I BELIEVE I LEFT HIM INCREDULOUS TO THE LAST FOR HIS CONSTANT ANSWER TO MY UNWEARIED ENTREATIES WAS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE DUTCH SCHOOLMASTER IN THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD I HAVE TEN THOUSAND FLORINS A YEAR WITHOUT GREEK
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY THE MEMORY OF THIS PROMISE THAT MADE HIM SAY TO HIS COMPANION A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THAT HE RATHER WONDERED HE SHOULD BE SO FOND OF THAT GIRL IN THE FIRST PLACE HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW FOND I AM OF HER ASKED LORD LAMBETH
I DREADED TO BEHOLD THIS MONSTER BUT I FEARED STILL MORE THAT HENRY SHOULD SEE HIM ENTREATING HIM THEREFORE TO REMAIN A FEW MINUTES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS I DARTED UP TOWARDS MY OWN ROOM
DO NOT ASK ME CRIED I PUTTING MY HANDS BEFORE MY EYES FOR I THOUGHT I SAW THE DREADED SPECTRE GLIDE INTO THE ROOM HE CAN TELL OH SAVE ME SAVE ME
I FELT MY FLESH TINGLE WITH EXCESS OF SENSITIVENESS AND MY PULSE BEAT RAPIDLY I WAS UNABLE TO REMAIN FOR A SINGLE INSTANT IN THE SAME PLACE I JUMPED OVER THE CHAIRS CLAPPED MY HANDS AND LAUGHED ALOUD
A STEP TO WHICH PERCY BEAUMONT AT FIRST OFFERED SOME CONSCIENTIOUS OPPOSITION I CALL HIS OPPOSITION CONSCIENTIOUS BECAUSE IT WAS FOUNDED UPON SOME TALK THAT HE HAD HAD ON THE SECOND DAY WITH BESSIE ALDEN
IS IT AN IMPORTANT POSITION SHE ASKED OH DEAR NO SAID LORD LAMBETH I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD BE VERY GRAND SAID BESSIE ALDEN TO POSSESS SIMPLY BY AN ACCIDENT OF BIRTH THE RIGHT TO MAKE LAWS FOR A GREAT NATION
THEY WERE INDULGING IN PRACTICES THAT IMPARTED A SHADE OF HYPOCRISY TO THE LADY'S REGRET FOR HER HUSBAND'S ABSENCE I ASSURE YOU WE ARE ALWAYS DISCUSSING AND DIFFERING SAID PERCY BEAUMONT SHE IS AWFULLY ARGUMENTATIVE
TO SAY TO LORD LAMBETH THAT HE SUSPECTED THAT THE DUCHESS'S TELEGRAM WAS IN PART THE RESULT OF SOMETHING HE HIMSELF HAD WRITTEN TO HER I WROTE TO HER AS I EXPLICITLY NOTIFIED YOU I HAD PROMISED TO DO
I SAW A LITTLE HUT AND BEFORE THE HUT BURNT A FIRE AND ROUND ABOUT THE FIRE A FUNNY LITTLE DWARF WAS DANCING UPON ONE LEG AND SINGING MERRILY THE FEAST I'LL MAKE TODAY I'LL BREW TOMORROW BAKE
ON LONG SEA ROADS BENEATH A SKY LIGHTED UP BY MARVELOUS SUNSETS OF SUPPERS ON THE RETURN INFORMAL IRREGULAR AGREEABLE
THAT HE ONE DAY TOLD THE KING OF THE LAND WHO USED TO COME AND HUNT IN THE WOOD THAT HIS DAUGHTER COULD SPIN GOLD OUT OF STRAW NOW THIS KING WAS VERY FOND OF MONEY
THE FIRST LITTLE CHILD THAT YOU MAY HAVE WHEN YOU ARE QUEEN THAT MAY NEVER BE THOUGHT THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER AND AS SHE KNEW NO OTHER WAY TO GET HER TASK DONE SHE SAID SHE WOULD DO WHAT HE ASKED
IN THE COURSE OF LONG ISLAND RIDES WITH A SLOW RETURN IN THE GLOWING TWILIGHT ON THE DEEP VERANDA LATE IN THE EVENING LORD LAMBETH WHO HAD STAYED AT MANY HOUSES
I PERCEIVED THAT THE FALLEN LEAVES HAD DISAPPEARED AND THAT THE YOUNG BUDS WERE SHOOTING FORTH FROM THE TREES THAT SHADED MY WINDOW IT WAS A DIVINE SPRING AND THE SEASON CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO MY CONVALESCENCE
ROUND WENT THE WHEEL AGAIN TO THE OLD SONG AND THE MANIKIN ONCE MORE SPUN THE HEAP INTO GOLD THE KING CAME IN THE MORNING AND FINDING ALL HE WANTED WAS FORCED TO KEEP HIS WORD
HIS HAIR WAS OF A LUSTROUS BLACK AND FLOWING HIS TEETH OF A PEARLY WHITENESS BUT THESE LUXURIANCES ONLY FORMED A MORE HORRID CONTRAST WITH HIS WATERY EYES
NOW THE QUEEN LAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT THINKING OF ALL THE ODD NAMES THAT SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND SHE SENT MESSENGERS ALL OVER THE LAND TO FIND OUT NEW ONES THE NEXT DAY THE LITTLE MAN CAME AND SHE BEGAN WITH TIMOTHY
I FELT ALSO SENTIMENTS OF JOY AND AFFECTION REVIVE IN MY BOSOM MY GLOOM DISAPPEARED AND IN A SHORT TIME I BECAME AS CHEERFUL AS BEFORE I WAS ATTACKED BY THE FATAL PASSION
COULD HE ALLUDE TO AN OBJECT ON WHOM I DARED NOT EVEN THINK COMPOSE YOURSELF SAID CLERVAL WHO OBSERVED MY CHANGE OF COLOUR I WILL NOT MENTION IT IF IT AGITATES YOU
RUMPELSTILTSKIN SAID THE LADY SLYLY SOME WITCH TOLD YOU THAT SOME WITCH TOLD YOU THAT CRIED THE LITTLE MAN AND DASHED HIS RIGHT FOOT IN A RAGE SO DEEP INTO THE FLOOR THAT HE WAS FORCED TO LAY HOLD OF IT WITH BOTH HANDS TO PULL IT OUT
HIS LIMBS WERE IN PROPORTION AND I HAD SELECTED HIS FEATURES AS BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL GREAT GOD HIS YELLOW SKIN SCARCELY COVERED THE WORK OF MUSCLES AND ARTERIES BENEATH
AND IN THE SECOND PLACE WHY SHOULDN'T I BE FOND OF HER I SHOULDN'T THINK SHE WOULD BE IN YOUR LINE WHAT DO YOU CALL MY LINE YOU DON'T SET HER DOWN AS FAST EXACTLY SO
TO DO IT FOR YOU MY NECKLACE REPLIED THE MAIDEN HE TOOK HER AT HER WORD AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN TO THE WHEEL AND WHISTLED AND SANG ROUND ABOUT ROUND ABOUT LO AND BEHOLD
MISSUS WESTGATE HOWEVER WAS NOT TO ENJOY MUCH LONGER THE ENTERTAINMENT WITH WHICH AN INDULGENT HUSBAND HAD DESIRED TO KEEP HER PROVIDED ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF AUGUST LORD LAMBETH RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM HIS MOTHER
IT WAS LORD LAMBETH'S THEORY FREELY PROPOUNDED WHEN THE YOUNG MEN WERE TOGETHER THAT PERCY BEAUMONT WAS HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME WITH MISSUS WESTGATE AND THAT UNDER THE PRETEXT OF MEETING FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANIMATED DISCUSSION
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INFUSING LIFE INTO AN INANIMATE BODY FOR THIS I HAD DEPRIVED MYSELF OF REST AND HEALTH I HAD DESIRED IT WITH AN ARDOUR THAT FAR EXCEEDED MODERATION
I FEEL THE GREATEST REMORSE FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN THE OCCASION BUT YOU WILL FORGIVE ME YOU WILL REPAY ME ENTIRELY IF YOU DO NOT DISCOMPOSE YOURSELF BUT GET WELL AS FAST AS YOU CAN
AND HE HAD BEEN DELIBERATING UPON DEATH CONFOUND HIM HE HAD FOUND THAT TO MEDITATE ABOUT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE WHILE ALL ITS GLAMOUR HAD GONE WITH THE SHIP IN THE NIGHT WHAT MORE NATURAL
THE MAGISTRATE HAD SWAYED FORWARD
AFFLICTED BY SOME MYSTERIOUS TROPICAL DISEASE WHO HELD THE DOCTOR FOR AN ASS AND INDULGED IN SECRET DEBAUCHERIES OF PATENT MEDICINE WHICH HIS TAMIL SERVANT USED TO SMUGGLE IN WITH UNWEARIED DEVOTION THEY TOLD EACH OTHER THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES
THE SUNSHINE THE MEMORIES THE FUTURE WHICH MEANS TO SWEEP THE WHOLE PRECIOUS WORLD UTTERLY AWAY FROM HIS SIGHT BY THE SIMPLE AND APPALLING ACT OF TAKING HIS LIFE JIM
AND TORMENTED AS IF AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS OF UNREST HE DID NOT CARE WHAT THE END WOULD BE AND IN HIS LUCID MOMENTS OVERVALUED HIS INDIFFERENCE THE DANGER WHEN NOT SEEN HAS THE IMPERFECT VAGUENESS OF HUMAN THOUGHT
TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HIS LEFT ARM WAS BROKEN HE HAD SLIPPED ON THE TOP STEP WHEN GETTING DOWN WHILE I WAS FORWARD HE EXCLAIMED MY GOD THAT ROTTEN BULKHEAD'LL GIVE WAY IN A MINUTE
CHAPTER TWO AFTER TWO YEARS OF TRAINING HE WENT TO SEA AND ENTERING THE REGIONS SO WELL KNOWN TO HIS IMAGINATION FOUND THEM STRANGELY BARREN OF ADVENTURE HE MADE MANY VOYAGES
FOR THE TERRIBLY DISTINCT QUESTIONS THAT EXTORTED HIS ANSWERS SEEMED TO SHAPE THEMSELVES IN ANGUISH AND PAIN WITHIN HIS BREAST CAME TO HIM POIGNANT AND SILENT
KEEP UP THE ILLUSION OF MY BEGINNINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD ROBBED OUR COMMON LIFE OF THE LAST SPARK OF ITS GLAMOUR AND SO YOU CLEARED OUT AT ONCE JUMPED HE CORRECTED ME INCISIVELY JUMPED MIND
THAT THIS COMPLICATION OF ACCIDENTS OR THESE ELEMENTAL FURIES ARE COMING AT HIM WITH A PURPOSE OF MALICE WITH A STRENGTH BEYOND CONTROL WITH AN UNBRIDLED CRUELTY THAT MEANS TO TEAR OUT OF HIM HIS HOPE AND HIS FEAR
HOW THIS ONE HAD AN EASY BILLET IN JAPAN SOMEWHERE AND THAT ONE WAS DOING WELL IN THE SIAMESE NAVY AND IN ALL THEY SAID IN THEIR ACTIONS IN THEIR LOOKS IN THEIR PERSONS COULD BE DETECTED THE SOFT SPOT THE PLACE OF DECAY
BROUGHT INTO THE BARE ROOM THE SOFTNESS OF THE SKY THE LANGUOR OF THE EARTH THE BEWITCHING BREATH OF THE EASTERN WATERS THERE WERE PERFUMES IN IT SUGGESTIONS OF INFINITE REPOSE THE GIFT OF ENDLESS DREAMS
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I DIDN'T AFTER ALL DIDN'T GO OUT IN THAT WAY I WASN'T GOING TO BE FRIGHTENED AT WHAT I HAD DONE AND ANYHOW IF I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP I WOULD HAVE DONE MY BEST TO BE SAVED
BUT I KNEW THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LIVE IT DOWN ALONE WITH MYSELF I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IN TO SUCH A BEASTLY UNFAIR THING WHAT DID IT PROVE AFTER ALL I WAS CONFOUNDEDLY CUT UP SICK OF LIFE
SAID THE GERMAN SKIPPER TO HIS NEW CHIEF MATE AN ARAB THE LEADER OF THAT PIOUS VOYAGE CAME LAST HE WALKED SLOWLY ABOARD HANDSOME AND GRAVE IN HIS WHITE GOWN AND LARGE TURBAN A STRING OF SERVANTS FOLLOWED LOADED WITH HIS LUGGAGE
GLIDED PAST ON HIS DESCENT AND SANK MYSTERIOUSLY INTO THE SEA EVENING AFTER EVENING PRESERVING THE SAME DISTANCE AHEAD OF HER ADVANCING BOWS THE FIVE WHITES ON BOARD LIVED AMIDSHIPS ISOLATED FROM THE HUMAN CARGO
OUTSIDE THE COURT THE SUN BLAZED WITHIN WAS THE WIND OF GREAT PUNKAHS THAT MADE YOU SHIVER THE SHAME THAT MADE YOU BURN THE ATTENTIVE EYES WHOSE GLANCE STABBED THE FACE OF THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE
NO THE PROPER THING WAS TO FACE IT OUT ALONE FOR MYSELF WAIT FOR ANOTHER CHANCE
COMING FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AND FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE EAST AFTER TREADING THE JUNGLE PATHS DESCENDING THE RIVERS COASTING IN PRAUS ALONG THE SHALLOWS CROSSING IN SMALL CANOES FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND PASSING THROUGH SUFFERING
WHO WANTED FACTS AFTER HIS FIRST FEELING OF REVOLT HE HAD COME ROUND TO THE VIEW THAT ONLY A METICULOUS PRECISION OF STATEMENT WOULD BRING OUT THE TRUE HORROR BEHIND THE APPALLING FACE OF THINGS
THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FORESTS THEIR CLEARINGS THE PROTECTION OF THEIR RULERS THEIR PROSPERITY THEIR POVERTY THE SURROUNDINGS OF THEIR YOUTH AND THE GRAVES OF THEIR FATHERS THEY CAME COVERED WITH DUST WITH SWEAT WITH GRIME WITH RAGS
BRUTALISED ALL THOSE HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF AND WORE A BLOOD AND IRON AIR COMBINED WITH A PURPLE NOSE AND A RED MOUSTACHE AFTER SHE HAD BEEN PAINTED OUTSIDE AND WHITEWASHED INSIDE EIGHT HUNDRED PILGRIMS MORE OR LESS
OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO IMAGINE YOURSELF TO HAVE BEEN OF THE SORT WHOSE APPEARANCE CLAIMS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THESE ILLUSIONS YOU HAD THOUGHT GONE OUT EXTINCT COLD AND WHICH AS IF REKINDLED AT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER FLAME
CLEAN SHAVED AND IMPASSIBLE LOOKED AT HIM DEADLY PALE BETWEEN THE RED FACES OF THE TWO NAUTICAL ASSESSORS THE LIGHT OF A BROAD WINDOW UNDER THE CEILING FELL FROM ABOVE ON THE HEADS AND SHOULDERS OF THE THREE MEN
HAD REMAINED AS OFFICERS OF COUNTRY SHIPS THEY HAD NOW A HORROR OF THE HOME SERVICE WITH ITS HARDER CONDITIONS SEVERER VIEW OF DUTY AND THE HAZARD OF STORMY OCEANS THEY WERE ATTUNED TO THE ETERNAL PEACE OF EASTERN SKY AND SEA
HIS FINGERS PLAYED INCESSANTLY TOUCHING THE PAPER WITHOUT NOISE I DID NOT THINK OF DANGER JUST THEN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE STARTLED ALL THIS HAPPENED IN SUCH A QUIET WAY AND SO VERY SUDDENLY
STOP THE ENGINES INSTEAD OF MAKING A ROW ABOUT IT ON DECK I HEARD HIM SAY GET UP RUN FLY HE SWORE ALSO THE ENGINEER SLID DOWN THE STARBOARD LADDER AND BOLTED ROUND THE SKYLIGHT TO THE ENGINE ROOM COMPANION
I KNEW THERE WAS NO OTHER BULKHEAD IN THE SHIP BUT THE COLLISION BULKHEAD SEPARATING THE FOREPEAK FROM THE FOREHOLD I WENT BACK TO TELL THE CAPTAIN I CAME UPON THE SECOND ENGINEER GETTING UP AT THE FOOT OF THE BRIDGE LADDER HE SEEMED DAZED AND
I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN I AM I AM A GENTLEMAN TOO YES YES I SAID HASTILY HE WAS LOOKING ME SQUARELY IN THE FACE AND WITHDREW HIS GAZE SLOWLY
HADN'T WE ALL COMMENCED WITH THE SAME DESIRE ENDED WITH THE SAME KNOWLEDGE CARRIED THE MEMORY OF THE SAME CHERISHED GLAMOUR THROUGH THE SORDID DAYS OF IMPRECATION WHAT WONDER THAT WHEN SOME
NOBODY WOULD KNOW OF COURSE BUT THIS DID NOT MAKE IT ANY EASIER FOR ME YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT TOO I DID NOT WANT ALL THIS TALK NO YES I WON'T LIE
THE AWNINGS COVERED THE DECK WITH A WHITE ROOF FROM STEM TO STERN AND A FAINT HUM A LOW MURMUR OF SAD VOICES ALONE REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF A CROWD OF PEOPLE UPON THE GREAT BLAZE OF THE OCEAN
THE MISTS WERE CLOSING AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD I APPEARED TO HIM AND HOW MUCH WISE NOT HALF AS OLD AS I FELT JUST THEN NOT HALF AS USELESSLY WISE AS I KNEW MYSELF TO BE
HE REPEATED AND I WONDERED AT THE EVIDENT BUT OBSCURE INTENTION WELL YES PERHAPS I COULD NOT SEE THEN BUT I HAD PLENTY OF TIME AND ANY AMOUNT OF LIGHT IN THAT BOAT AND I COULD THINK TOO
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GREED OF ADVENTURES THAT ARE THEIR OWN AND ONLY REWARD WHAT WE GET WELL WE WON'T TALK OF THAT BUT CAN ONE OF US RESTRAIN A SMILE
FELT A SHIVER RUN DOWN HIS BACK THE BIG ASSESSOR HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS AND DRUMMED ON WITHOUT A SOUND CARELESS AND MOURNFUL THE EYES OF THE OTHER ABOVE THE SUNBURNT CLASPED FINGERS
THEY STREAMED ABOARD OVER THREE GANGWAYS THEY STREAMED IN URGED BY FAITH AND THE HOPE OF PARADISE THEY STREAMED IN WITH A CONTINUOUS TRAMP AND SHUFFLE OF BARE FEET WITHOUT A WORD A MURMUR OR A LOOK BACK
AS IF ALL THESE PEOPLE SITTING IN ORDERLY ROWS UPON NARROW BENCHES HAD BEEN ENSLAVED BY THE FASCINATION OF HIS VOICE IT WAS VERY LOUD IT RANG STARTLING IN HIS OWN EARS IT WAS THE ONLY SOUND AUDIBLE IN THE WORLD
HE PRONOUNCED WITH A CONVULSIVE EFFORT WHOSE STRESS AS IF PROPAGATED BY THE WAVES OF THE AIR MADE MY BODY STIR A LITTLE IN THE CHAIR HE FIXED ME WITH LOWERING EYES DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME HE CRIED I SWEAR
ENVELOPED IN A FULGOR OF SUNSHINE THAT KILLED ALL THOUGHT OPPRESSED THE HEART WITHERED ALL IMPULSES OF STRENGTH AND ENERGY AND UNDER THE SINISTER SPLENDOUR OF THAT SKY THE SEA BLUE AND PROFOUND REMAINED STILL WITHOUT A STIR
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THIS WHAT'S THE GOOD HE TAPPED WITH HIS FOOT SLIGHTLY BIT HIS LIP AND LOOKED AWAY OVER THE HEADS HE MET THE EYES OF THE WHITE MAN THE GLANCE DIRECTED AT HIM WAS NOT THE FASCINATED STARE OF THE OTHERS
HEAVY PROD GETS HOME THE BOND IS FOUND TO BE CLOSE THAT BESIDES THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CRAFT THERE IS FELT THE STRENGTH OF A WIDER FEELING THE FEELING THAT BINDS A MAN TO A CHILD HE WAS THERE BEFORE ME BELIEVING THAT
WHICH WAS ON THE PORT SIDE HE MOANED AS HE RAN HE SPOKE SLOWLY HE REMEMBERED SWIFTLY AND WITH EXTREME VIVIDNESS HE COULD HAVE REPRODUCED LIKE AN ECHO THE MOANING OF THE ENGINEER FOR THE BETTER INFORMATION OF THESE MEN
SUCH WERE THE DAYS STILL HOT HEAVY DISAPPEARING ONE BY ONE INTO THE PAST AS IF FALLING INTO AN ABYSS FOR EVER OPEN IN THE WAKE OF THE SHIP AND THE SHIP LONELY UNDER A WISP OF SMOKE
MEETING STRANGE SIGHTS BESET BY STRANGE FEARS UPHELD BY ONE DESIRE THEY CAME FROM SOLITARY HUTS IN THE WILDERNESS FROM POPULOUS CAMPONGS FROM VILLAGES BY THE SEA AT THE CALL OF AN IDEA
AND FORTUNATELY HE REMEMBERED EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO GO ON TALKING FOR TRUTH'S SAKE PERHAPS FOR HIS OWN SAKE ALSO AND WHILE HIS UTTERANCE WAS DELIBERATE HIS MIND POSITIVELY FLEW ROUND AND ROUND THE SERRIED CIRCLE OF FACTS
THE BIG FRAMEWORK OF PUNKAHS MOVED GENTLY TO AND FRO HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND FROM BELOW MANY EYES WERE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF DARK FACES OUT OF WHITE FACES OUT OF RED FACES OUT OF FACES ATTENTIVE SPELLBOUND
AND HIS VOICE SPOKE I WAS SO LOST YOU KNOW IT WAS THE SORT OF THING ONE DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAPPEN TO ONE IT WAS NOT LIKE A FIGHT FOR INSTANCE
HIS VOICE SOUNDED REASONABLE SUPPOSE I HAD NOT I MEAN TO SAY SUPPOSE I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP WELL HOW MUCH LONGER SAY A MINUTE HALF A MINUTE
A LITTLE VICIOUSLY I FEAR DON'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CRAFT I WAS AGGRIEVED AGAINST HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CHEATED ME
THE TIMID WOMEN MUFFLED UP AND CLASPING TO THEIR BREASTS WRAPPED IN LOOSE ENDS OF SOILED HEAD CLOTHS THEIR SLEEPING BABIES THE UNCONSCIOUS PILGRIMS OF AN EXACTING BELIEF
DISABLED BY A FALLING SPAR AT THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK OF WHICH HIS SCOTTISH CAPTAIN USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS MAN IT'S A PAIRFECT MEERACLE TO ME HOW SHE LIVED THROUGH IT SPENT MANY DAYS STRETCHED ON HIS BACK DAZED BATTERED HOPELESS
THERE ARE MANY SHADES IN THE DANGER OF ADVENTURES AND GALES AND IT IS ONLY NOW AND THEN THAT THERE APPEARS ON THE FACE OF FACTS A SINISTER VIOLENCE OF INTENTION THAT INDEFINABLE SOMETHING WHICH FORCES IT UPON THE MIND AND THE HEART OF A MAN
HE SAID SPEAKING OF THE SHIP SHE WENT OVER WHATEVER IT WAS AS EASY AS A SNAKE CRAWLING OVER A STICK THE ILLUSTRATION WAS GOOD THE QUESTIONS WERE AIMING AT FACTS
AND THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY WAS BEING HELD IN THE POLICE COURT OF AN EASTERN PORT HE STOOD ELEVATED IN THE WITNESS BOX WITH BURNING CHEEKS IN A COOL LOFTY ROOM
THE SOUND OF HIS OWN TRUTHFUL STATEMENTS CONFIRMED HIS DELIBERATE OPINION THAT SPEECH WAS OF NO USE TO HIM ANY LONGER THAT MAN THERE SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF HIS HOPELESS DIFFICULTY JIM LOOKED AT HIM THEN TURNED AWAY
AND WHEN CLEAR OF CONFINING RAILS SPREAD ON ALL SIDES OVER THE DECK FLOWED FORWARD AND AFT OVERFLOWED DOWN THE YAWNING HATCHWAYS FILLED THE INNER RECESSES OF THE SHIP LIKE WATER FILLING A CISTERN
I INTERJECTED I WOULD HAVE MEANT TO BE HE RETORTED AND THAT'S MORE THAN I MEANT WHEN I HE SHIVERED AS IF ABOUT TO SWALLOW SOME NAUSEOUS DRUG JUMPED
LOOKING AT JIM WITH THOUGHTFUL BLUE EYES THE OTHER A HEAVY SCORNFUL MAN THROWN BACK IN HIS SEAT HIS LEFT ARM EXTENDED FULL LENGTH DRUMMED DELICATELY WITH HIS FINGER TIPS ON A BLOTTING PAD IN THE MIDDLE THE MAGISTRATE
HAD PRESERVED AN UNDEFACED ENERGY WITH THE TEMPER OF BUCCANEERS AND THE EYES OF DREAMERS THEY APPEARED TO LIVE IN A CRAZY MAZE OF PLANS HOPES DANGERS ENTERPRISES AHEAD OF CIVILISATION IN THE DARK PLACES OF THE SEA
HE HAD COME ACROSS THAT MAN BEFORE IN THE STREET PERHAPS HE WAS POSITIVE HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM FOR DAYS FOR MANY DAYS HE HAD SPOKEN TO NO ONE BUT HAD HELD SILENT INCOHERENT AND ENDLESS CONVERSE WITH HIMSELF
OVERSHADOWED BY A FRAGMENT OF AN UNRUFFLED FOREHEAD AND WITH THE VERY FIRST WORD UTTERED MARLOW'S BODY EXTENDED AT REST IN THE SEAT WOULD BECOME VERY STILL AS THOUGH HIS SPIRIT HAD WINGED ITS WAY BACK INTO THE LAPSE OF TIME
THE EDGE OF HIS TEMPER AND THE FIBRE OF HIS STUFF THAT REVEAL THE QUALITY OF HIS RESISTANCE AND THE SECRET TRUTH OF HIS PRETENCES NOT ONLY TO OTHERS BUT ALSO TO HIMSELF
LIKE WATER FLOWING INTO CREVICES AND CRANNIES LIKE WATER RISING SILENTLY EVEN WITH THE RIM EIGHT HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN WITH FAITH AND HOPES WITH AFFECTIONS AND MEMORIES THEY HAD COLLECTED THERE
THE STRONG MEN AT THE HEAD OF FAMILY PARTIES THE LEAN OLD MEN PRESSING FORWARD WITHOUT HOPE OF RETURN YOUNG BOYS WITH FEARLESS EYES GLANCING CURIOUSLY SHY LITTLE GIRLS WITH TUMBLED LONG HAIR
AS IF FACTS COULD EXPLAIN ANYTHING AFTER YOU HAD CONCLUDED YOU HAD COLLIDED WITH SOMETHING FLOATING AWASH SAY A WATER LOGGED WRECK YOU WERE ORDERED BY YOUR CAPTAIN TO GO FORWARD AND ASCERTAIN IF THERE WAS ANY DAMAGE DONE
HE SEEMED CALM ENOUGH ONLY HE STUMBLED SEVERAL TIMES AND ONCE AS I STOOD SPEAKING TO HIM HE WALKED RIGHT INTO ME AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STONE BLIND HE MADE NO DEFINITE ANSWER TO WHAT I HAD TO TELL
I WANTED IT IT IS THE VERY THING I WANTED THERE DO YOU THINK YOU OR ANYBODY COULD HAVE MADE ME IF I I AM I AM NOT AFRAID TO TELL AND I WASN'T AFRAID TO THINK EITHER I LOOKED IT IN THE FACE
HE RESTED HIS TEMPLE IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THE WIND OF THE PUNKAHS EDDIED DOWN ON THE HEADS ON THE DARK FACED NATIVES WOUND ABOUT IN VOLUMINOUS DRAPERIES ON THE EUROPEANS SITTING TOGETHER VERY HOT
WITHOUT A RIPPLE WITHOUT A WRINKLE VISCOUS STAGNANT DEAD THE PATNA WITH A SLIGHT HISS PASSED OVER THAT PLAIN LUMINOUS AND SMOOTH UNROLLED A BLACK RIBBON OF SMOKE ACROSS THE SKY
LIKE A PRISONER ALONE IN HIS CELL OR LIKE A WAYFARER LOST IN A WILDERNESS AT PRESENT HE WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT DID NOT MATTER THOUGH THEY HAD A PURPOSE BUT HE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER AGAIN SPEAK OUT AS LONG AS HE LIVED
ITS EYE OF FLAME AS IF IN DERISION OF HER ERRAND OF FAITH SHE CLEARED THE STRAIT CROSSED THE BAY CONTINUED ON HER WAY THROUGH THE ONE DEGREE PASSAGE SHE HELD ON STRAIGHT FOR THE RED SEA UNDER A SERENE SKY
LIGHTED BY FESTAL SUNSHINE ITS SHIPS LIKE TOYS ITS BRILLIANT ACTIVITY RESEMBLING A HOLIDAY PAGEANT WITH THE ETERNAL SERENITY OF THE EASTERN SKY OVERHEAD AND THE SMILING PEACE OF THE EASTERN SEAS
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR A FELLOW IN MY POSITION TO BE BELIEVED MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO AN ELDER MAN IT IS SO DIFFICULT SO AWFULLY UNFAIR SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
JIM LOOKED EVERY DAY OVER THE THICKETS OF GARDENS BEYOND THE ROOFS OF THE TOWN OVER THE FRONDS OF PALMS GROWING ON THE SHORE AT THAT ROADSTEAD WHICH IS A THOROUGHFARE TO THE EAST AT THE ROADSTEAD DOTTED BY GARLANDED ISLETS
HE LAY THERE BATTENED DOWN IN THE MIDST OF A SMALL DEVASTATION AND FELT SECRETLY GLAD HE HAD NOT TO GO ON DECK BUT NOW AND AGAIN AN UNCONTROLLABLE RUSH OF ANGUISH WOULD GRIP HIM BODILY
HE APPEARED CHANGED AS IF HE HAD SUDDENLY MATURED ONE COULDN'T BE SURE HE MUTTERED AH YOU WERE NOT SURE I SAID
HE DID NOT STRIKE HIM AGAIN HE STOOD BENDING OVER HIM AND SPEAKING ANGRILY BUT QUITE LOW
AND THEN THE UNINTELLIGENT BRUTALITY OF AN EXISTENCE LIABLE TO THE AGONY OF SUCH SENSATIONS FILLED HIM WITH A DESPAIRING DESIRE TO ESCAPE AT ANY COST THEN FINE WEATHER RETURNED AND HE THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT
HOW MUCH MORE DID YOU WANT I ASKED BUT I THINK I SPOKE SO LOW THAT HE DID NOT CATCH WHAT I SAID HE HAD ADVANCED HIS ARGUMENT AS THOUGH LIFE HAD BEEN A NETWORK OF
MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO FLOAT FOR HOURS IN THE OPEN SEA AND BE PICKED UP NOT MUCH THE WORSE FOR IT I MIGHT HAVE LASTED IT OUT BETTER THAN MANY OTHERS THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH MY HEART
AND ON THE SECRET PURPOSES OF THEIR HEARTS THE STEAMER POUNDED IN THE DUSK THE CALM WATER OF THE STRAIT AND FAR ASTERN OF THE PILGRIM SHIP A SCREW PILE LIGHTHOUSE PLANTED BY UNBELIEVERS ON A TREACHEROUS SHOAL SEEMED TO WINK AT HER
THE FACTS THOSE MEN WERE SO EAGER TO KNOW HAD BEEN VISIBLE TANGIBLE OPEN TO THE SENSES OCCUPYING THEIR PLACE IN SPACE AND TIME REQUIRING FOR THEIR EXISTENCE A FOURTEEN HUNDRED TON STEAMER
PLAYED CARDS A LITTLE OR YAWNING AND IN PYJAMAS LOUNGED THROUGH THE DAY IN EASY CHAIRS WITHOUT SAYING A WORD THE HOSPITAL STOOD ON A HILL AND A GENTLE BREEZE ENTERING THROUGH THE WINDOWS ALWAYS FLUNG WIDE OPEN
HE ASSOCIATED NATURALLY WITH THE MEN OF HIS CALLING IN THE PORT THESE WERE OF TWO KINDS SOME VERY FEW AND SEEN THERE BUT SELDOM LED MYSTERIOUS LIVES
A HAIR'S BREADTH HE MUTTERED NOT THE BREADTH OF A HAIR BETWEEN THIS AND THAT AND AT THE TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE A HAIR AT MIDNIGHT I PUT IN
GLITTER OF THE VAST SURFACE WHICH IS ONLY A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN GLANCES FULL OF FIRE THERE IS SUCH MAGNIFICENT VAGUENESS IN THE EXPECTATIONS THAT HAD DRIVEN EACH OF US TO SEA SUCH A GLORIOUS INDEFINITENESS
AND AUDIBLY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AFTER DINNER ON A VERANDAH DRAPED IN MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS IN THE DEEP DUSK SPECKLED BY FIERY CIGAR ENDS THE ELONGATED BULK OF EACH CANE CHAIR
IT WAS AN ACT OF INTELLIGENT VOLITION JIM BETWEEN TWO QUESTIONS FORGOT HIMSELF SO FAR AS TO FIND LEISURE FOR A THOUGHT THIS FELLOW RAN THE THOUGHT LOOKS AT ME AS THOUGH HE COULD SEE SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING PAST MY SHOULDER
AND WAS PLACATED BY THE SOUND OF A FAINT SIGH THAT PASSED BETWEEN US LIKE THE FLIGHT OF A BIRD IN THE NIGHT WELL I WASN'T HE SAID COURAGEOUSLY IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRETCHED STORY THEY MADE UP IT WAS NOT A LIE
HELD ON HER STEADFAST WAY BLACK AND SMOULDERING IN A LUMINOUS IMMENSITY AS IF SCORCHED BY A FLAME FLICKED AT HER FROM A HEAVEN WITHOUT PITY
I WAS TOLD TO CALL NO ONE AND TO MAKE NO NOISE FOR FEAR OF CREATING A PANIC I THOUGHT THE PRECAUTION REASONABLE I TOOK ONE OF THE LAMPS THAT WERE HUNG UNDER THE AWNINGS AND WENT FORWARD AFTER OPENING THE FOREPEAK HATCH I HEARD SPLASHING IN THERE
I WASN'T GOING TO RUN AWAY AT FIRST AT NIGHT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THOSE FELLOWS I MIGHT HAVE NO BY HEAVENS I WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM THAT SATISFACTION THEY HAD DONE ENOUGH THEY MADE UP A STORY AND BELIEVED IT FOR ALL I KNOW
HARBOURED A SILENT LISTENER NOW AND THEN A SMALL RED GLOW WOULD MOVE ABRUPTLY AND EXPANDING LIGHT UP THE FINGERS OF A LANGUID HAND PART OF A FACE IN PROFOUND REPOSE OR FLASH A CRIMSON GLEAM INTO A PAIR OF PENSIVE EYES
THE DETERMINATION TO LOUNGE SAFELY THROUGH EXISTENCE TO JIM THAT GOSSIPING CROWD VIEWED AS SEAMEN SEEMED AT FIRST MORE UNSUBSTANTIAL THAN SO MANY SHADOWS BUT AT LENGTH HE FOUND A FASCINATION IN THE SIGHT OF THOSE MEN
AT HIS BACK WAS THE DARK NIGHT WITH THE CLEAR STARS WHOSE DISTANT GLITTER DISPOSED IN RETREATING PLANES LURED THE EYE INTO THE DEPTHS OF A GREATER DARKNESS
AND YET A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT SEEMED TO SHOW ME HIS BOYISH HEAD AS IF IN THAT MOMENT THE YOUTH WITHIN HIM HAD FOR A MOMENT GLOWED AND EXPIRED YOU ARE AN AWFUL GOOD SORT TO LISTEN
SURELY IN NO OTHER CRAFT AS IN THAT OF THE SEA DO THE HEARTS OF THOSE ALREADY LAUNCHED TO SINK OR SWIM GO OUT SO MUCH TO THE YOUTH ON THE BRINK LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES UPON THAT
LIKE THIS HE SAID IT DOES ME GOOD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME YOU DON'T WORDS SEEMED TO FAIL HIM IT WAS A DISTINCT GLIMPSE HE WAS A YOUNGSTER OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO SEE ABOUT YOU
IN THEIR APPEARANCE OF DOING SO WELL ON SUCH A SMALL ALLOWANCE OF DANGER AND TOIL IN TIME BESIDE THE ORIGINAL DISDAIN THERE GREW UP SLOWLY ANOTHER SENTIMENT AND SUDDENLY GIVING UP THE IDEA OF GOING HOME
HIS LAMENESS HOWEVER PERSISTED AND WHEN THE SHIP ARRIVED AT AN EASTERN PORT HE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL HIS RECOVERY WAS SLOW AND HE WAS LEFT BEHIND
PERDITION THAT DWELT WITHIN LIKE A MALEVOLENT SOUL IN A DETESTABLE BODY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE THIS CLEAR THIS HAD NOT BEEN A COMMON AFFAIR EVERYTHING IN IT HAD BEEN OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
BUT IT WASN'T TRUTH ALL THE SAME IT WAS SOMETHING ONE KNOWS A DOWNRIGHT LIE THERE WAS NOT THE THICKNESS OF A SHEET OF PAPER BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF THIS AFFAIR
RESTED UPON A WHITE MAN WHO SAT APART FROM THE OTHERS WITH HIS FACE WORN AND CLOUDED BUT WITH QUIET EYES THAT GLANCED STRAIGHT INTERESTED AND CLEAR JIM ANSWERED ANOTHER QUESTION AND WAS TEMPTED TO CRY OUT
SHE WAS OWNED BY A CHINAMAN CHARTERED BY AN ARAB AND COMMANDED BY A SORT OF RENEGADE NEW SOUTH WALES GERMAN VERY ANXIOUS TO CURSE PUBLICLY HIS NATIVE COUNTRY BUT WHO APPARENTLY ON THE STRENGTH OF BISMARCK'S VICTORIOUS POLICY
AND IN DRILL SUITS THAT SEEMED TO FIT THEM AS CLOSE AS THEIR SKINS AND HOLDING THEIR ROUND PITH HATS ON THEIR KNEES WHILE GLIDING ALONG THE WALLS THE COURT PEONS BUTTONED TIGHT IN LONG WHITE COATS FLITTED RAPIDLY TO AND FRO
IN NO OTHER KIND OF LIFE IS THE ILLUSION MORE WIDE OF REALITY IN NO OTHER IS THE BEGINNING ALL ILLUSION THE DISENCHANTMENT MORE SWIFT THE SUBJUGATION MORE COMPLETE
WHO HAD WORN OUT THE PATIENCE OF ALL HER OTHER RELATIONS JUST AT THE TIME WHEN SHE MOST NEEDED LOOKING AFTER AND PROTECTING FROM MATRIMONIAL PERILS BUT DOCTOR CARVER AREN'T YOU AFRAID OF DOCTOR CARVER
BUT I USED TO AND HE UNDERSTANDS AH IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS TOLD YOU YOU DON'T LIKE US AND YOU LIKE BEAUFORT BECAUSE HE'S SO UNLIKE US HE LOOKED ABOUT THE BARE ROOM
THOSE WERE OF THE PUREST EIGHTEEN THIRTY WITH A GRIM HARMONY OF CABBAGE ROSE GARLANDED CARPETS ROSEWOOD CONSOLES ROUND ARCHED FIRE PLACES
BUT STILL HE MADE NO EFFORT TO DRAW NEARER HE HAD KNOWN THE LOVE THAT IS FED ON CARESSES AND FEEDS THEM
INVITING THE COUNTESS OLENSKA TO THE DINNER WHICH THE VAN DER LUYDENS WERE GIVING THE FOLLOWING WEEK FOR THEIR COUSIN THE DUKE OF SAINT AUSTREY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEN IN THE CLUB BOX EXCHANGED A SMILE AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
OR IF NOT SHE CONTINUED PURSUING HER OWN THOUGHT WITH A PAINFUL APPLICATION IF IT'S NOT WORTH WHILE TO HAVE GIVEN UP TO HAVE MISSED THINGS SO THAT OTHERS MAY BE SAVED FROM DISILLUSIONMENT AND MISERY
BUT NOW WE LIVE IN A CONSTANT RUSH SAID MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN IN MEASURED TONES LOOKING WITH PLEASANT DELIBERATION ABOUT THE LARGE SHROUDED ROOM WHICH TO ARCHER WAS SO COMPLETE AN IMAGE OF ITS OWNERS
AND BEAUFORT DO YOU SAY THESE THINGS TO BEAUFORT HE ASKED ABRUPTLY
I PROMISE YOU NOT AS LONG AS YOU HOLD OUT
I WON'T GO BACK SHE SAID AND TURNING AWAY SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND LED THE WAY INTO THE PUBLIC DINING ROOM THE STRIDENT SCHOOL TEACHERS
I HAD HER ORDERS TO TELL YOU THAT WE WERE ENGAGED BUT I COULDN'T IN THAT CROWD THE SMILE PASSED FROM COUNTESS OLENSKA'S EYES TO HER LIPS SHE LOOKED YOUNGER MORE LIKE THE BOLD BROWN ELLEN MINGOTT OF HIS BOYHOOD
OF COURSE I KNOW YES AND I'M SO GLAD BUT ONE DOESN'T TELL SUCH THINGS FIRST IN A CROWD THE LADIES WERE ON THE THRESHOLD AND SHE HELD OUT HER HAND GOOD BYE COME AND SEE ME SOME DAY SHE SAID STILL LOOKING AT ARCHER
AND IMMENSE GLAZED BOOK CASES OF MAHOGANY WHEREAS OLD MISSUS MINGOTT WHO HAD BUILT HER HOUSE LATER HAD BODILY CAST OUT THE MASSIVE FURNITURE OF HER PRIME AND MINGLED WITH THE MINGOTT HEIRLOOMS
OVERWHELMED BY WHAT IT SUDDENLY TOLD HIM YOU TOO OH ALL THIS TIME YOU TOO
THE VAN DER LUYDENS WERE MORBIDLY SENSITIVE TO ANY CRITICISM OF THEIR SECLUDED EXISTENCE THEY WERE THE ARBITERS OF FASHION THE COURT OF LAST APPEAL AND THEY KNEW IT AND BOWED TO THEIR FATE
HE DROPPED INTO HIS CHAIR WHAT HER ANSWER REALLY SAID WAS IF YOU LIFT A FINGER YOU'LL DRIVE ME BACK BACK TO ALL THE ABOMINATIONS YOU KNOW OF AND ALL THE TEMPTATIONS YOU HALF GUESS
AND WITH CHARACTERISTIC INDEPENDENCE SHE HAD MADE HER RECEPTION ROOMS UPSTAIRS AND ESTABLISHED HERSELF IN FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF ALL THE NEW YORK PROPRIETIES ON THE GROUND FLOOR OF HER HOUSE
BUT ALWAYS APPEARED TO INCLINE TO CLEMENCY TILL HER THIN LIPS WAVERING INTO THE SHADOW OF A SMILE MADE THE ALMOST INVARIABLE REPLY I SHALL FIRST HAVE TO TALK THIS OVER WITH MY HUSBAND
AT THAT HE SPRANG UP FORGETTING EVERYTHING BUT THE SWEETNESS OF HER FACE SHE ROSE TOO NOT AS IF TO MEET HIM OR TO FLEE FROM HIM BUT QUIETLY
I THINK MY UNCLE EGMONT USED TO SAY HE FOUND IT LESS AGITATING NOT TO READ THE MORNING PAPERS TILL AFTER DINNER SAID MISSUS ARCHER RESPONSIVELY YES MY GOOD FATHER ABHORRED HURRY
I'M THE MAN WHO MARRIED ONE WOMAN BECAUSE ANOTHER ONE TOLD HIM TO HER PALENESS TURNED TO A FUGITIVE FLUSH I THOUGHT YOU PROMISED YOU WERE NOT TO SAY SUCH THINGS TODAY
AND PROCEEDED TO REHEARSE ONCE MORE THE MONSTROUS TALE OF THE AFFRONT INFLICTED ON MISSUS LOVELL MINGOTT OF COURSE SHE ENDED AUGUSTA WELLAND AND MARY MINGOTT BOTH FELT THAT
FOR THAT'S THE THING WE'VE ALWAYS GOT TO THINK OF HAVEN'T WE BY YOUR OWN SHOWING SHE INSISTED MY OWN SHOWING HE ECHOED HIS BLANK EYES STILL ON THE SEA
I AM SURE LOUISA WILL BE AS GLAD AS I AM IF COUNTESS OLENSKA WILL LET US INCLUDE HER AMONG OUR GUESTS HE GOT UP BENT HIS LONG BODY WITH A STIFF FRIENDLINESS TOWARD HIS COUSIN AND ADDED
OLD FASHIONED EYES I HOPE YOU DON'T MEAN MINE MY DEAR I LIKE ALL THE NOVELTIES SAID THE ANCESTRESS LIFTING THE STONE TO HER SMALL BRIGHT ORBS WHICH NO GLASSES HAD EVER DISFIGURED
THEY LUNCHED SLOWLY AND MEDITATIVELY WITH MUTE INTERVALS BETWEEN RUSHES OF TALK FOR THE SPELL ONCE BROKEN THEY HAD MUCH TO SAY AND YET MOMENTS WHEN SAYING BECAME THE MERE ACCOMPANIMENT
WITH TWO TINY WHITE HANDS POISED LIKE GULLS ON THE SURFACE OF THE BILLOWS THE BURDEN OF MISSUS MANSON MINGOTT'S FLESH HAD LONG SINCE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO GO UP AND DOWN STAIRS
BUT BEING SHY AND RETIRING PERSONS WITH NO NATURAL INCLINATION FOR THEIR PART THEY LIVED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THE SYLVAN SOLITUDE OF SKUYTERCLIFF AND WHEN THEY CAME TO TOWN DECLINED ALL INVITATIONS
TO CALL ON MISSUS WELLAND AFTER WHICH HE AND MISSUS WELLAND AND MAY DROVE OUT TO OLD MISSUS MANSON MINGOTT'S TO RECEIVE THAT VENERABLE ANCESTRESS'S BLESSING A VISIT TO MISSUS MANSON MINGOTT
HE TURNED AROUND WITHOUT MOVING FROM HIS PLACE AND IN THAT CASE THERE'S NO REASON ON EARTH WHY YOU SHOULDN'T GO BACK HE CONCLUDED FOR HER HER EYES WERE CLINGING TO HIM DESPERATELY
FLUTTERED OVER MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S FACE SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GUESSED AND APPROVED MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN TURNED TO MISSUS ARCHER IF LOUISA'S HEALTH ALLOWED HER TO DINE OUT
BEING LONG FORESEEN BY WATCHFUL RELATIVES HAD BEEN CAREFULLY PASSED UPON IN FAMILY COUNCIL AND THE ENGAGEMENT RING A LARGE THICK SAPPHIRE SET IN INVISIBLE CLAWS MET WITH HER UNQUALIFIED ADMIRATION
I MET THE COUNTESS ELLEN IN MADISON SQUARE AND SHE WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO LET ME WALK HOME WITH HER AH I HOPE THE HOUSE WILL BE GAYER NOW THAT ELLEN'S HERE CRIED MISSUS MINGOTT WITH A GLORIOUS EFFRONTERY SIT DOWN SIT DOWN BEAUFORT PUSH UP THE YELLOW ARMCHAIR
AH HOW LIKE A WOMAN NONE OF YOU WILL EVER SEE A BAD BUSINESS THROUGH SHE LOWERED HER VOICE IS IT A BAD BUSINESS FOR MAY
YET SO CHAINED TO THEIR SEPARATE DESTINIES THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN HALF THE WORLD APART
TO MAKE THIS MEETING THEIR LAST HE MUST LEAVE THEIR FUTURE IN HER CARE ASKING ONLY THAT SHE SHOULD KEEP FAST HOLD OF IT DON'T DON'T BE UNHAPPY
THAT HE SHOULD NEVER AGAIN FEEL QUITE ALONE BUT AFTER A MOMENT THE SENSE OF WASTE AND RUIN OVERCAME HIM THERE THEY WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND SAFE AND SHUT IN
FOR A LONG TIME I'VE HOPED THIS CHANCE WOULD COME THAT I MIGHT TELL YOU HOW YOU'VE HELPED ME WHAT YOU'VE MADE OF ME ARCHER SAT STARING BENEATH FROWNING BROWS HE INTERRUPTED HER WITH A LAUGH
SHE DREW TOGETHER HER TROUBLED BROWS BUT IT SEEMS AS IF I'D NEVER BEFORE UNDERSTOOD WITH HOW MUCH THAT IS HARD AND SHABBY AND BASE
PRESIDING AT A CABINET MEETING NOT FROM ANY ARROGANCE OF MIND BUT BECAUSE THE HABIT OF A LIFE TIME AND THE ATTITUDE OF HER FRIENDS AND RELATIONS HAD LED HER TO CONSIDER MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN'S LEAST GESTURE
AND MINE A PART OF YOURS SHE NODDED AND THAT'S TO BE ALL FOR EITHER OF US WELL IT IS ALL ISN'T IT
SUCH AS PEOPLE REPORTED HAVING SEEN IN PARIS MEANWHILE AS EVERY ONE SHE CARED TO SEE CAME TO HER AND SHE COULD FILL HER ROOMS AS EASILY AS THE BEAUFORTS AND WITHOUT ADDING A
OR IN A TONE LESS ENCOURAGING TO THE VANITY OF THE PERSON ADDRESSED ARCHER REDDENED TO THE TEMPLES BUT DARED NOT MOVE OR SPEAK IT WAS AS IF HER WORDS HAD BEEN SOME RARE BUTTERFLY
SHE TALKED TO HIM OF THE YEAR AND A HALF SINCE THEY HAD MET SHE HAD GROWN TIRED OF WHAT PEOPLE CALLED SOCIETY NEW YORK WAS KIND IT WAS ALMOST OPPRESSIVELY HOSPITABLE
THEN EVERYTHING I CAME HOME FOR EVERYTHING THAT MADE MY OTHER LIFE SEEM BY CONTRAST SO BARE AND SO POOR BECAUSE NO ONE THERE TOOK ACCOUNT OF THEM ALL THESE THINGS ARE A SHAM OR A DREAM
HE UNDERSTOOD IT AS CLEARLY AS IF SHE HAD UTTERED THE WORDS AND THE THOUGHT KEPT HIM ANCHORED TO HIS SIDE OF THE TABLE IN A KIND OF MOVED AND SACRED SUBMISSION WHAT A LIFE FOR YOU HE GROANED
WAS ALWAYS AN AMUSING EPISODE TO THE YOUNG MAN THE HOUSE IN ITSELF WAS ALREADY AN HISTORIC DOCUMENT THOUGH NOT OF COURSE AS VENERABLE AS CERTAIN OTHER OLD FAMILY HOUSES IN UNIVERSITY PLACE AND LOWER FIFTH AVENUE
SHE ADDED WITH THE SWEETEST LOOK HENRY ALWAYS ENJOYS SEEING YOU DEAR ADELINE AND HE WILL WISH TO CONGRATULATE NEWLAND THE DOUBLE DOORS HAD SOLEMNLY REOPENED
AS STATELY AS HER OWN PERHAPS FOR SHE WAS AN IMPARTIAL WOMAN EVEN STATELIER AND THAT THE COBBLE STONES OVER WHICH THE OLD CLATTERING OMNIBUSES BUMPED WOULD BE REPLACED BY SMOOTH ASPHALT
THEY NEVER DO ANYTHING ELSE AND IN SPITE OF THE COSMOPOLITAN VIEWS ON WHICH HE PRIDED HIMSELF HE THANKED HEAVEN THAT HE WAS A NEW YORKER
WERE MERELY PALE GREY INSTEAD OF PALE BLUE MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN GREETED MISSUS ARCHER WITH COUSINLY AFFABILITY PROFFERED TO NEWLAND LOW VOICED CONGRATULATIONS
VERY HANDSOME SHE ADDED RETURNING THE JEWEL VERY LIBERAL IN MY TIME A CAMEO SET IN PEARLS WAS THOUGHT SUFFICIENT BUT IT'S THE HAND THAT SETS OFF THE RING ISN'T IT MY DEAR MISTER ARCHER
ON THE PLEA OF MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S HEALTH NEWLAND ARCHER CAME TO HIS MOTHER'S RESCUE EVERYBODY IN NEW YORK KNOWS WHAT YOU AND COUSIN LOUISA REPRESENT THAT'S WHY MISSUS MINGOTT FELT
TO PICTURE HER BLAMELESS LIFE LED IN THE STAGE SETTING OF ADULTERY BUT HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH CONSIDERABLE ADMIRATION THAT IF A LOVER HAD BEEN WHAT SHE WANTED THE INTREPID WOMAN WOULD HAVE HAD HIM TOO
AND SO SHE HAD DECIDED TO TRY WASHINGTON WHERE ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET MORE VARIETIES OF PEOPLE AND OF OPINION AND ON THE WHOLE SHE SHOULD PROBABLY SETTLE DOWN IN WASHINGTON AND MAKE A HOME THERE FOR POOR MEDORA
AND OUT AT THE BARE BEACH AND THE ROW OF STARK WHITE VILLAGE HOUSES STRUNG ALONG THE SHORE WE'RE DAMNABLY DULL
WHICH ON A DAY OF SUCH GLARING SUNLIGHT AND AT THE SHOPPING HOUR SEEMED IN ITSELF AN INDELICATE THING FOR A COMPROMISED WOMAN TO DO BUT AT ANY RATE IT SPARED THEM THE EMBARRASSMENT OF HER PRESENCE
SINGLE ITEM TO THE MENU OF HER SUPPERS SHE DID NOT SUFFER FROM HER GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION THE IMMENSE ACCRETION OF FLESH WHICH HAD DESCENDED ON HER IN MIDDLE LIFE LIKE A FLOOD OF LAVA ON A DOOMED CITY
I'M CERTAIN OF IT SIR LARRY HAS BEEN GOING IT RATHER HARDER THAN USUAL LATELY IF COUSIN LOUISA WON'T MIND MY MENTIONING IT
OR ONLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS BUT IT WAS LONG ENOUGH FOR HER SILENCE TO COMMUNICATE ALL SHE HAD TO SAY AND FOR HIM TO FEEL THAT ONLY ONE THING MATTERED HE MUST DO NOTHING
THE MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN WHO SAT BENEATH IT LISTENING TO MISSUS ARCHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE TWIN SISTER OF THE FAIR AND STILL YOUNGISH WOMAN DROOPING AGAINST A GILT ARMCHAIR BEFORE A GREEN REP CURTAIN
I HEAR HE'S BEEN STAYING WITH YOU AT THE BLENKERS SHE SMILED OH THE CARVER DANGER IS OVER DOCTOR CARVER IS A VERY CLEVER MAN HE WANTS A RICH WIFE TO FINANCE HIS PLANS
THE TICK OF THE MONUMENTAL ORMOLU CLOCK ON THE WHITE MARBLE MANTELPIECE GREW AS LOUD AS THE BOOM OF A MINUTE GUN ARCHER CONTEMPLATED WITH AWE
DON'T WAIT TILL THE BUBBLE'S OFF THE WINE MARRY THEM BEFORE LENT I MAY CATCH PNEUMONIA ANY WINTER NOW AND I WANT TO GIVE THE WEDDING BREAKFAST THESE SUCCESSIVE STATEMENTS WERE RECEIVED
IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT DAY THE FIRST OF THE USUAL BETROTHAL VISITS WERE EXCHANGED THE NEW YORK RITUAL WAS PRECISE AND INFLEXIBLE IN SUCH MATTERS
HE TURNED TOWARD THE YOUNG MAN HAVE YOU READ THIS MORNING'S TIMES NEWLAND WHY YES SIR SAID ARCHER WHO USUALLY TOSSED OFF HALF A DOZEN PAPERS WITH HIS MORNING COFFEE
WHICH RECALLED SCENES IN FRENCH FICTION AND ARCHITECTURAL INCENTIVES TO IMMORALITY SUCH AS THE SIMPLE AMERICAN HAD NEVER DREAMED OF THAT WAS HOW WOMEN WITH LOVERS LIVED IN THE WICKED OLD SOCIETIES
TALKS AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE ABOUT THE IMPERTINENCE OF INVITING HIS WIFE TO MEET PEOPLE HE DOESN'T WISH HER TO KNOW HE'S SIMPLY USING MADAME OLENSKA AS A LIGHTNING ROD I'VE SEEN HIM TRY THE SAME THING OFTEN BEFORE THE LEFFERTSES
OH MISSUS WELLAND MURMURED WHILE THE YOUNG MAN SMILING AT HIS BETROTHED REPLIED AS SOON AS EVER IT CAN IF ONLY YOU'LL BACK ME UP MISSUS MINGOTT WE MUST GIVE THEM TIME TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BETTER MAMMA
FACED THAT OF HER LOVELY ANCESTRESS IT WAS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AS FINE AS A CABANEL AND THOUGH TWENTY YEARS HAD ELAPSED SINCE ITS EXECUTION WAS STILL A PERFECT LIKENESS INDEED
TO LAY SIEGE TO THE TIGHT LITTLE CITADEL OF NEW YORK OF COURSE IF YOU AND REGINA INVITE HER THE THING IS SETTLED WELL WE NEED NEW BLOOD AND NEW MONEY AND I HEAR SHE'S STILL VERY GOOD LOOKING
IT'S BEYOND HUMAN ENDURING THAT'S ALL OH DON'T SAY THAT WHEN I'M ENDURING IT SHE BURST OUT HER EYES FILLING HER ARMS HAD DROPPED ALONG THE TABLE AND SHE SAT WITH HER FACE ABANDONED TO HIS GAZE
AND NEITHER MADE ANY SHOW OF MOVING ARCHER WAS CONSCIOUS OF A CURIOUS INDIFFERENCE TO HER BODILY PRESENCE HE WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AWARE OF IT IF ONE OF THE HANDS SHE HAD FLUNG OUT ON THE TABLE HAD NOT DRAWN HIS GAZE
THE FRIVOLOUS UPHOLSTERY OF THE SECOND EMPIRE
UPHOLSTERED LIKE A SOFA AND A TOILET TABLE WITH FRIVOLOUS LACE FLOUNCES AND A GILT FRAMED MIRROR HER VISITORS WERE STARTLED AND FASCINATED BY THE FOREIGNNESS OF THIS ARRANGEMENT
AND MEDORA IS SIMPLY A GOOD ADVERTISEMENT AS A CONVERT A CONVERT TO WHAT TO ALL SORTS OF NEW AND CRAZY SOCIAL SCHEMES BUT DO YOU KNOW THEY INTEREST ME MORE THAN THE BLIND CONFORMITY TO TRADITION
SHE AND MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN WERE SO EXACTLY ALIKE THAT ARCHER OFTEN WONDERED HOW AFTER FORTY YEARS OF THE CLOSEST CONJUGALITY TWO SUCH MERGED IDENTITIES
NOT AS A CHECK BUT AS A GUIDE TO HIM THEY FELL INTO HIS WHILE HER ARMS EXTENDED BUT NOT RIGID KEPT HIM FAR ENOUGH OFF TO LET HER SURRENDERED FACE SAY THE REST THEY MAY HAVE STOOD IN THAT WAY FOR A LONG TIME
TO LONG DUOLOGUES OF SILENCE ARCHER KEPT THE TALK FROM HIS OWN AFFAIRS NOT WITH CONSCIOUS INTENTION BUT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO MISS A WORD OF HER HISTORY AND LEANING ON THE TABLE
AS IF WATCHING CALMLY FOR LIFE AND FASHION TO FLOW NORTHWARD TO HER SOLITARY DOORS SHE SEEMED IN NO HURRY TO HAVE THEM COME FOR HER PATIENCE WAS EQUALLED BY HER CONFIDENCE SHE WAS SURE THAT
SOME TIME THEN SOME TIME THAT YOU ALREADY FORESEE
WITH THE PROPER EXPRESSIONS OF AMUSEMENT INCREDULITY AND GRATITUDE AND THE VISIT WAS BREAKING UP IN A VEIN OF MILD PLEASANTRY WHEN THE DOOR OPENED TO ADMIT THE COUNTESS OLENSKA WHO ENTERED IN BONNET AND MANTLE
BUT ARCHER KNEW THAT MISSUS WELLAND WAS THINKING IT'S A MISTAKE FOR ELLEN TO BE SEEN THE VERY DAY AFTER HER ARRIVAL
AT LENGTH SHE SAID I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THE CONFESSION MORE DISPASSIONATELY
AND SHE WAVED ONE OF HER TINY HANDS WITH SMALL POINTED NAILS AND ROLLS OF AGED FAT ENCIRCLING THE WRIST LIKE IVORY BRACELETS MINE WAS MODELLED IN ROME BY THE GREAT FERRIGIANI
AND THE YOUNG MAN HIMSELF MENTALLY ADDED AND SHE OUGHT TO KNOW THAT A MAN WHO'S JUST ENGAGED DOESN'T SPEND HIS TIME CALLING ON MARRIED WOMEN
MISSUS HENRY VAN DER LUYDEN LISTENED IN SILENCE TO HER COUSIN MISSUS ARCHER'S NARRATIVE IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO TELL YOURSELF IN ADVANCE THAT MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN WAS ALWAYS SILENT AND THAT
MISSUS WELLAND INTERPOSED WITH THE PROPER AFFECTATION OF RELUCTANCE TO WHICH THE ANCESTRESS REJOINED KNOW EACH OTHER FIDDLESTICKS EVERYBODY IN NEW YORK HAS ALWAYS KNOWN EVERYBODY
EVER SEPARATED THEMSELVES ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING AS CONTROVERSIAL AS A TALKING OVER BUT AS NEITHER HAD EVER REACHED A DECISION WITHOUT PREFACING IT BY THIS MYSTERIOUS CONCLAVE MISSUS ARCHER AND HER SON
ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF NEWLAND'S ENGAGEMENT YOU AND HENRY OUGHT TO KNOW AH SAID MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN DRAWING A DEEP BREATH THERE WAS A SILENCE DURING WHICH
THAN WHEN THE PORTRAIT HAD BEEN PAINTED SHE ALWAYS INDEED STRUCK NEWLAND ARCHER AS HAVING BEEN RATHER GRUESOMELY PRESERVED IN THE AIRLESS ATMOSPHERE OF A PERFECTLY IRREPROACHABLE EXISTENCE AS BODIES CAUGHT IN GLACIERS
AND ALSO TO HAVE A LITTLE CANVASBACK SHOOTING AT TREVENNA MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN PAUSED AGAIN AND CONTINUED WITH INCREASING BENEVOLENCE BEFORE TAKING HIM DOWN TO MARYLAND WE ARE INVITING A FEW FRIENDS TO MEET HIM HERE ONLY A LITTLE DINNER
COUCHED IN THE SAME LANGUAGE AS HIS WIFE'S AND SEATED HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE BROCADE ARMCHAIRS WITH THE SIMPLICITY OF A REIGNING SOVEREIGN I HAD JUST FINISHED READING THE TIMES HE SAID
IT SEEMS SO TO ME SAID HIS WIFE AS IF SHE WERE PRODUCING A NEW THOUGHT I HAD NO IDEA MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN CONTINUED THAT THINGS HAD COME TO SUCH A PASS
NOW I'VE GOT YOU I WANT A GOOD GOSSIP I HEAR YOUR BALL WAS MAGNIFICENT AND I UNDERSTAND YOU INVITED MISSUS LEMUEL STRUTHERS WELL I'VE A CURIOSITY TO SEE THE WOMAN MYSELF SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER RELATIVES
WE'LL HOPE IT HAS NOT QUITE COME TO THAT SAID MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN FIRMLY AH IF ONLY YOU AND LOUISA WENT OUT MORE SIGHED MISSUS ARCHER
SOMEBODY ELSE'S TRADITION THAT I SEE AMONG OUR OWN FRIENDS IT SEEMS STUPID TO HAVE DISCOVERED AMERICA ONLY TO MAKE IT INTO A COPY OF ANOTHER COUNTRY SHE SMILED ACROSS THE TABLE
CRYING OUT TO HER BENEATH HIS WORDS SHE SAT MOTIONLESS WITH LOWERED LIDS OH I SHAN'T GO YET NOT YET
HE STOOD IN THE WINDOW DRUMMING AGAINST THE RAISED SASH AND FEELING IN EVERY FIBRE THE WISTFUL TENDERNESS WITH WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN HER COUSIN'S NAME
BY REACHING HER LONG HAND TOWARD THE BELL ROPE I THINK SHE SAID I SHOULD LIKE HENRY TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME A FOOTMAN APPEARED TO WHOM SHE GRAVELY ADDED
AS HAVING AN ALMOST SACERDOTAL IMPORTANCE HER PROMPTNESS OF ACTION SHOWED THAT SHE CONSIDERED THE CASE AS PRESSING AS MISSUS ARCHER BUT LEST SHE SHOULD BE THOUGHT TO HAVE COMMITTED HERSELF IN ADVANCE
OF COURSE YOU KNOW ALREADY ABOUT MAY AND ME HE SAID
PRESENTLY THE HOARDINGS THE QUARRIES THE ONE STORY SALOONS THE WOODEN GREEN HOUSES IN RAGGED GARDENS AND THE ROCKS FROM WHICH GOATS SURVEYED THE SCENE
AND THAT EVENING AT THE OPERA MISTER SILLERTON JACKSON WAS ABLE TO STATE THAT
THE CARNIVOROUS OLD LADY DECLARED IN THE HALL WHILE MISSUS WELLAND AND MAY DREW ON THEIR FURS ARCHER SAW THAT THE COUNTESS OLENSKA WAS LOOKING AT HIM WITH A FAINTLY QUESTIONING SMILE
WERE GATHERING UP THEIR POSSESSIONS PREPARATORY TO A STRAGGLING FLIGHT TO THE WHARF ACROSS THE BEACH LAY THE WHITE STEAM BOAT AT THE PIER AND OVER THE SUNLIT WATERS BOSTON LOOMED
HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AGAIN THEIR PALE EYES CLUNG TOGETHER IN PROLONGED AND SERIOUS CONSULTATION THEN A FAINT SMILE
THAN THE GRIMNESS OF SOME OF HIS MOTHER'S OLD AUNTS FIERCE SPINSTERS WHO SAID NO ON PRINCIPLE BEFORE THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ASKED MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S ATTITUDE SAID NEITHER YES NOR NO
THOUGH NON COMMITTAL BY NATURE AND TRAINING SHE WAS VERY KIND TO THE PEOPLE SHE REALLY LIKED EVEN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THESE FACTS WAS NOT ALWAYS A PROTECTION FROM THE CHILL THAT DESCENDED ON ONE
AND THE BEAUTIFUL OLD CARVED FRAME OF GAINSBOROUGH'S LADY ANGELICA DU LAC MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S PORTRAIT BY HUNTINGTON IN BLACK VELVET AND VENETIAN POINT
MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN STILL WORE BLACK VELVET AND VENETIAN POINT WHEN SHE WENT INTO SOCIETY OR RATHER SINCE SHE NEVER DINED OUT WHEN SHE THREW OPEN HER OWN DOORS TO RECEIVE IT HER FAIR HAIR
BUT THIS PASSION THAT WAS CLOSER THAN HIS BONES WAS NOT TO BE SUPERFICIALLY SATISFIED HIS ONE TERROR WAS TO DO ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT EFFACE THE SOUND AND IMPRESSION OF HER WORDS HIS ONE THOUGHT
MISSUS HALE IF SHE SPOKE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED WITH A READY MADE LIST
TOO PLAINLY FOR BEAUTY IF HIS FEATURES HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT AS IT WAS THEY HAD A GRACE IF NOT A COMELINESS OF THEIR OWN THE FACE WAS IN REPOSE BUT IT WAS RATHER REST AFTER WEARINESS
BUT SO MUCH THE MORE I HAVE TO WATCH OVER YOU NOW AS FOR FANNY THERE A LITTLE HARDSHIP WOULD DO HER GOOD SHE IS NOT MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AS YOU ARE JOHN SHE COULD NOT BEAR IT
FOR INFORMATION ON THESE MATTERS THEY MUST GO TO LARGER AND MORE TECHNICAL WORKS MY AIM HERE IS THE MORE GENERAL ONE OF INDICATING FIRST THE CHARACTERISTIC EXPERIENCES DISCOVERABLE WITHIN ALL GREAT RELIGIONS
RATHER THAN THE ABIDING SUBSTANCE OF SPIRITUALITY READERS OF THESE PAGES WILL FIND NOTHING ABOUT TRANCES ECSTASIES AND OTHER RARE PSYCHIC PHENOMENA WHICH SOMETIMES INDICATE HOLINESS AND SOMETIMES ONLY DISEASE
WERE BY FAR THE LIGHTEST NEWEST AND MOST AMUSING THE BOOK SHELVES DID NOT AFFORD MUCH RESOURCE MARGARET TOLD HER MOTHER EVERY PARTICULAR OF HER LONDON LIFE TO ALL OF WHICH MISSUS HALE LISTENED WITH INTEREST
BUT HER HEART GAVE THANKS FOR HIM DAY AND NIGHT AND SHE WALKED PROUDLY AMONG WOMEN FOR HIS SAKE FANNY DEAR I SHALL HAVE HORSES TO THE CARRIAGE TO DAY TO GO AND CALL ON THESE HALES
EVERY IMPROVEMENT OF MACHINERY IS I BELIEVE TO BE SEEN THERE IN ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T LIKE MILLS AND MANUFACTORIES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS SAID FANNY IN A HALF WHISPER
NO ROSEBUD THAT COULD ONLY OPEN JUST ENOUGH TO LET OUT A YES AND NO AND AN'T PLEASE YOU SIR BUT THE WIDE MOUTH WAS ONE SOFT CURVE OF RICH RED LIPS AND THE SKIN IF NOT WHITE AND FAIR
AND THE PROBLEMS SURROUNDING SYMBOLS AND CULTS THESE CHAPTERS LEAD UP TO A DISCUSSION OF THE PERSONAL ASPECT OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE ITS CURVE OF GROWTH CHARACTERS AND ACTIVITIES
HIS ROOM WAS KEPT EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT IT AND WAS REGULARLY DUSTED AND PUT INTO ORDER BY DIXON MISSUS HALE'S MAID WHO TOUCHED NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK
PERHAPS IT WAS NOT QUITE A LOGICAL DEDUCTION FROM ALL THESE PREMISES BUT IT WAS STILL MISSUS SHAW'S CHARACTERISTIC CONCLUSION AS SHE THOUGHT OVER HER SISTER'S LOT
AND SHE HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN ALL GRIEVANCES EXCEPT THAT OF THE UNHAPPINESS ARISING FROM DISPARITY OF AGE IN MARRIED LIFE ON WHICH SHE COULD DESCANT BY THE HALF HOUR DEAREST MARIA HAD MARRIED THE MAN OF HER HEART
WHICH THE UNEASY TENDERNESS OF MISSUS THORNTON'S MANNER TO HER DAUGHTER THE SHAME WITH WHICH SHE THOUGHT TO HIDE THE POVERTY OF HER CHILD IN ALL THE GRAND QUALITIES WHICH SHE HERSELF POSSESSED UNCONSCIOUSLY AND WHICH SHE SET SO HIGH A VALUE UPON IN OTHERS
HE WENT ABRUPTLY OUT OF THE ROOM AFTER SAYING THIS IF HE HAD STAID A MINUTE LONGER FANNY WOULD HAVE CRIED AT HIS TONE OF COMMAND EVEN WHEN HE USED THE WORDS YOU WILL OBLIGE ME
NO CONDITIONS BEING ATTACHED TO THIS APPOINTMENT IT SEEMED A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SO FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MOMENT SOME OF THE IMPLICITS WHICH I BELIEVE TO UNDERLIE HUMAN EFFORT
CHAPTER TWELVE MORNING CALLS WELL I SUPPOSE WE MUST FRIENDS IN COUNCIL
MISSUS HALE WAS MAKING RATHER MORE EXERTION IN HER ANSWERS CAPTIVATED BY SOME REAL OLD LACE WHICH MISSUS THORNTON WORE LACE AS SHE AFTERWARDS OBSERVED TO DIXON OF THAT OLD ENGLISH POINT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MADE FOR THIS SEVENTY YEARS AND
FANNY DON'T SPEAK SO OF YOUR BROTHER HE HAS GOOD REASONS OF SOME KIND OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NOT WISH US TO GO MAKE HASTE AND PUT YOUR THINGS ON
AS MISSUS THORNTON OBSERVED TO HERSELF SHE LIKED MISSUS HALE'S DOUBLE KNITTING FAR BETTER THAT WAS SENSIBLE OF ITS KIND THE ROOM ALTOGETHER WAS FULL OF KNICK KNACKS WHICH MUST TAKE A LONG TIME TO DUST AND TIME TO PEOPLE OF LIMITED INCOME WAS MONEY
AND WITH THE SOFT VIOLENCE OF THE WEST WIND BEHIND HER AS SHE CROSSED SOME HEATH SHE SEEMED TO BE BORNE ONWARDS AS LIGHTLY AND EASILY AS THE FALLEN LEAF THAT WAS WAFTED ALONG BY THE AUTUMNAL BREEZE
THE RELATION IN WHICH INSTITUTIONAL RELIGION DOES OR SHOULD STAND TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE IS ALSO IN PART A MATTER FOR PSYCHOLOGY WHICH IS HERE CALLED UPON TO DEAL WITH THE RELIGIOUS ASPECT OF THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
WHEN MARGARET HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HER A GREAT BOX OF BOOKS RECOMMENDED BY MASTERS OR GOVERNESS AND HAD FOUND THE SUMMER'S DAY ALL TOO SHORT TO GET THROUGH THE READING SHE HAD TO DO BEFORE HER RETURN TO TOWN
IF MISSUS SHAW HAD GUESSED AT THE REAL REASON WHY MISSUS HALE DID NOT ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWERED DOWN GOWNS UPON HER BUT IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE MISSUS SHAW HAD BEEN THE POOR PRETTY MISS BERESFORD
AND SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO THINK THAT THEIR MEETING AND GREETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT HELSTONE PARSONAGE RATHER THAN DURING THE CONFUSION OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOUSE IN HARLEY STREET WHERE SHE HERSELF HAD HAD TO PLAY THE PART OF FIGARO
I CALL MINE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE TASTE I LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHOSE OCCUPATIONS HAVE TO DO WITH LAND I LIKE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND THE THREE LEARNED PROFESSIONS AS THEY CALL THEM
FIFTEEN SHILLINGS A WEEK AND THREE SAVED OUT OF THEM THOUGHT MARGARET TO HERSELF BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY YOUNG SHE PROBABLY HAS FORGOTTEN HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT SHE MUST KNOW OF THOSE DAYS
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE OUT IN A CAB YOU CAME HOME WITH A HEADACHE FROM THE JOLTING I NEVER COMPLAINED OF IT I'M SURE NO
PSYCHOLOGY AND THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT TWO CONTEMPLATION AND SUGGESTION
SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY
HELSTONE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS OF THEIR OWN STANDARD OF CULTIVATION IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST OUT OF THE WAY PLACES IN ENGLAND SAID MISSUS HALE IN ONE OF HER PLAINTIVE MOODS
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF MILTON MISS HALE HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF OUR FACTORIES OUR MAGNIFICENT WAREHOUSES NO SAID MARGARET I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING OF THAT DESCRIPTION AS YET
WARM GRATITUDE FIRST TO THE PRINCIPAL AND AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE WHO GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY OF DELIVERING THESE CHAPTERS IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND WHOSE UNFAILING SYMPATHY AND KINDNESS SO GREATLY HELPED ME
THE OPPRESSION OF WHICH COULD NOT BE RELIEVED BY ANY DAILY ACTION SUCH AS COMFORTING THE SURVIVORS OR TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL IN HOPE OF LESSENING THE EVILS IN THE GENERATION TO COME MISTER HALE DID NOT GO OUT AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS AS MUCH AS USUAL
THE SUCCEEDING SECTIONS OF THE BOOK TREAT IN SOME DETAIL THE LIGHT CAST ON SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS BY MENTAL ANALYSIS A PROCESS WHICH NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE CONDUCTED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A DEGRADED MATERIALISM
THAN THE SERENE CALM OF THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE WHO LED A PLACID CONTENTED LIFE MARGARET WAS PAINFULLY STRUCK BY THE WORN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION AND SHE WENT BACK OVER THE OPEN AND AVOWED CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER FATHER'S LIFE
FULL OF DIMPLES AND GLANCES THAT SPOKE OF CHILDISH GLADNESS AND BOUNDLESS HOPE IN THE FUTURE IT WAS THE LATTER PART OF JULY WHEN MARGARET RETURNED HOME THE FOREST TREES WERE ALL ONE DARK FULL DUSKY GREEN
BY HER CONSCIOUS PRIDE IN BEING ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEM ALL IF NEED WERE BUT THE CLOUD NEVER COMES IN THAT QUARTER OF THE HORIZON FROM WHICH WE WATCH FOR IT THERE HAD BEEN SLIGHT COMPLAINTS AND PASSING REGRETS ON HER MOTHER'S PART
BUT EVERY DAY HE WAS MORE OVERPOWERED THE WORLD BECAME MORE BEWILDERING AT EACH REPEATED URGENCY OF HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD PUT HIMSELF IN THE WAY OF SEEKING SOME PREFERMENT
NO ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOSE ABNORMAL EXPERIENCES AND STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH TOO OFTEN REGARDED AS SPECIALLY MYSTICAL ARE NOW RECOGNIZED BY ALL COMPETENT STUDENTS AS REPRESENTING THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS
OR WHO ARE OFFENDED BY THE RESULTING DEMONSTRATIONS OF CONTINUITY BETWEEN OUR MOST HOMELY AND MOST LOFTY REACTIONS TO THE UNIVERSE MIGHT TAKE TO THEMSELVES THE PLAIN WORDS OF THOMAS A KEMPIS THOU ART A MAN AND NOT GOD THOU ART FLESH
WHICH CANNOT BE BOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN HEIR LOOM AND SHOWS THAT SHE HAD ANCESTORS SO THE OWNER OF THE ANCESTRAL LACE BECAME WORTHY OF SOMETHING MORE THAN THE LANGUID EXERTION TO BE AGREEABLE TO A VISITOR
WHO MIGHT NOW PUT THEMSELVES TO TROUBLE AND EXPENSE IN THEIR TURN YET CRAMPTON WAS TOO FAR OFF FOR HER TO WALK AND SHE HAD REPEATEDLY QUESTIONED HER SON AS TO WHETHER HIS WISH THAT SHE SHOULD CALL ON THE HALES WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR THE EXPENSE OF CAB HIRE
WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
WHICH JUSTIFY OR ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THESE EXPERIENCES MAY BE ACCOMMODATED TO THE WORLD VIEW OF THE MODERN MAN AND NEXT THE NATURE OF THAT SPIRITUAL LIFE AS IT APPEARS IN HUMAN HISTORY
AND NO ANGEL SINCE MY SUBJECT IS NOT THE SPLENDOR OF HISTORIC SANCTITY BUT THE NORMAL LIFE OF THE SPIRIT AS IT MAY BE AND IS LIVED IN THE HERE AND NOW
OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY
THE FULL ACCOUNT OF WHICH MARGARET HAD NEVER HEARD AND WHICH NOW SEEMED DOOMED TO BE BURIED IN SAD OBLIVION
THEN SHE FELT THAT BY CONCEALING HER UTTER INDIFFERENCE TO ALL SUCH PLACES SHE WAS HARDLY SPEAKING WITH TRUTH SO SHE WENT ON
SO HE WITHDREW WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE YET YOUNG INTO HIS LIBRARY TO SPEND HIS EVENINGS IF HE WERE AT HOME IN READING THE SPECULATIVE AND METAPHYSICAL BOOKS WHICH WERE HIS DELIGHT
TOO CROWDED THAT IS THE WORST
WITH WHAT ASKED MISSUS THORNTON HER BROW SLIGHTLY CONTRACTING
FAINTLY AS IF IT WERE AN UNUSUAL EXERTION HIS FACE RETURNED INTO ITS LINES OF HABITUAL ANXIETY HE HAD A TRICK OF HALF OPENING HIS MOUTH AS IF TO SPEAK WHICH CONSTANTLY UNSETTLED THE FORM OF THE LIPS
BEFORE WINTER FAIRLY SET IN ACCORDINGLY SHE WAS BUSY PREPARING HER BOARD ONE MORNING WHEN SARAH THE HOUSEMAID THREW WIDE OPEN THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND ANNOUNCED
THE PLACE AND THE LIFE SHE HAD LONGED FOR FOR YEARS AT THAT TIME OF ALL TIMES FOR YEARNING AND LONGING JUST BEFORE THE SHARP SENSES LOSE THEIR OUTLINES IN SLEEP
MISSUS THORNTON WAS NOT A WOMAN MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING HER QUICK JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION SERVED HER IN GOOD STEAD OF ANY LONG ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH HERSELF SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT NOTHING COULD STRENGTHEN FANNY TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS PATIENTLY
AND SHE REPINED EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY THAT HER HUSBAND WHO WAS MORE LEARNED THAN MISTER HUME A BETTER PARISH PRIEST THAN MISTER HOULDSWORTH SHOULD NOT HAVE MET WITH THE PREFERMENT THAT THESE TWO FORMER NEIGHBOURS OF THEIRS HAD DONE
AT THIS POINT MISTER THORNTON CAME IN JUST BEFORE GOING TO THE MILL MOTHER I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT IF THERE IS ANY LITTLE THING THAT COULD SERVE MISSUS HALE AS AN INVALID YOU WILL OFFER IT I'M SURE IF I CAN FIND IT OUT I WILL
AND MARGARET WOULD TRY TO TEMPT HER FORTH ON TO THE BEAUTIFUL BROAD UPLAND SUN STREAKED CLOUD SHADOWED COMMON FOR SHE WAS SURE THAT HER MOTHER HAD ACCUSTOMED HERSELF TOO MUCH TO AN IN DOORS LIFE SELDOM EXTENDING HER WALKS BEYOND THE CHURCH
AND GAVE THE FACE AN UNDECIDED EXPRESSION BUT HE HAD THE SAME LARGE SOFT EYES AS HIS DAUGHTER EYES WHICH MOVED SLOWLY AND ALMOST GRANDLY ROUND IN THEIR ORBITS AND WERE WELL VEILED BY THEIR TRANSPARENT WHITE EYELIDS
THE SCHOOL AND THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES THIS DID GOOD FOR A TIME BUT WHEN THE AUTUMN DREW ON AND THE WEATHER BECAME MORE CHANGEABLE HER MOTHER'S IDEA OF THE UNHEALTHINESS OF THE PLACE INCREASED
WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER HER FATHER SEEMED THE BEST PERSON TO APPLY TO FOR INFORMATION AND WHEN WITH HIM
BUT THE EVENINGS WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO FILL UP AGREEABLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER TEA HER FATHER WITHDREW INTO HIS SMALL LIBRARY AND SHE AND HER MOTHER WERE LEFT ALONE MISSUS HALE HAD NEVER CARED MUCH FOR BOOKS
MAY I INQUIRE MARGARET HAD NOT THE WORDS READY FOR AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WHICH TOOK HER A LITTLE BY SURPRISE SO MISS THORNTON REPLIED
IT WILL DO YOU GOOD INSTEAD OF HARM
AS SHE FELT IT YIELD UNDER HER LIGHT FOOT AND SEND UP THE FRAGRANCE PECULIAR TO IT OUT ON THE BROAD COMMONS INTO THE WARM SCENTED LIGHT SEEING MULTITUDES OF WILD FREE LIVING CREATURES REVELLING IN THE SUNSHINE
BUT SHE REFUSED TO LET HIM KEEP HORSES FOR IT THEY WERE HIRED FOR THE SOLEMN OCCASIONS WHEN SHE PAID MORNING OR EVENING VISITS SHE HAD HAD HORSES FOR THREE DAYS NOT A FORTNIGHT BEFORE
AS FANNY HAD PUT IT IT DID SEEM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IMPERTINENTLY DISCUSSING MISSUS THORNTON'S FEELINGS BUT SHE ALSO ROSE UP AGAINST THAT LADY'S MANNER OF SHOWING THAT SHE WAS OFFENDED MISSUS THORNTON WENT ON AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
TO FIND THE CAUSE FOR THE LINES THAT SPOKE SO PLAINLY OF HABITUAL DISTRESS AND DEPRESSION POOR FREDERICK THOUGHT SHE SIGHING OH IF FREDERICK HAD BUT BEEN A CLERGYMAN INSTEAD OF GOING INTO THE NAVY AND BEING LOST TO US ALL
ALIAS HER MARRIED LIFE SHE REMAINED WITH HER AND WAS DEVOTED TO HER INTERESTS ALWAYS CONSIDERING HERSELF AS THE GOOD AND PROTECTING FAIRY WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO BAFFLE THE MALIGNANT GIANT MISTER HALE
HER MOTHER HAD BEEN DETAINED AT HOME BY A MULTITUDE OF HALF REASONS NONE OF WHICH ANYBODY FULLY UNDERSTOOD EXCEPT MISTER HALE WHO WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT ALL HIS ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF A GREY SATIN GOWN
BUT THE LITTLE ALTERCATION BETWEEN HER SON AND HER DAUGHTER DID NOT INCLINE MISSUS THORNTON MORE FAVOURABLY TOWARDS THESE HALES HER JEALOUS HEART REPEATED HER DAUGHTER'S QUESTION
HE FOUND THAT THE INTERRUPTIONS WHICH AROSE OUT OF THESE DUTIES WERE REGARDED AS HARDSHIPS BY HIS WIFE NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF HIS PROFESSION BUT TO BE REGRETTED AND STRUGGLED AGAINST BY HER AS THEY SEVERALLY AROSE
I AM SO GLAD I AM GOING HOME TO BE AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM AND MAMMA SHE WAS READY WITH A BRIGHT SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF FATIGUE TO GREET HER FATHER WHEN HE AWAKENED HE SMILED BACK AGAIN BUT
AND ACHIEVEMENT IN THE DOMAIN OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE THE MATERIAL GATHERED FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS NOW BEEN ADDED TO REVISED AND TO SOME EXTENT RE WRITTEN
AND A FURTHER SECTION SUGGESTS SOME WAYS IN WHICH EDUCATIONISTS MIGHT PROMOTE THE UP SPRINGING OF THIS LIFE IN THE YOUNG FINALLY THE LAST CHAPTER ATTEMPTS TO PLACE THE FACT OF THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT IN ITS RELATION TO THE SOCIAL ORDER
AS DINNER GIVING AND AS CRITICISING OTHER PEOPLE'S DINNERS SHE TOOK SATISFACTION IN IT BUT THIS GOING TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH STRANGERS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING
ARE THOSE THE GORMANS WHO MADE THEIR FORTUNES IN TRADE AT SOUTHAMPTON OH I'M GLAD WE DON'T VISIT THEM I DON'T LIKE SHOPPY PEOPLE I THINK WE ARE FAR BETTER OFF KNOWING ONLY COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS
LEARNED AND DELIGHTED IN USING THEIR PECULIAR WORDS TOOK UP HER FREEDOM AMONGST THEM NURSED THEIR BABIES TALKED OR READ WITH SLOW DISTINCTNESS TO THEIR OLD PEOPLE
MISSUS THORNTON DID NOT SPEAK BUT SHE LAID HER WORK ON THE TABLE AND SEEMED TO THINK IT WILL BE A LONG WAY FOR HER TO WALK BACK AT NIGHT
THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP MANY LUXURIES WHICH HAD ONLY BEEN TROUBLES AND TRAMMELS TO HER FREEDOM IN HARLEY STREET HER KEEN ENJOYMENT OF EVERY SENSUOUS PLEASURE WAS BALANCED FINELY IF NOT OVERBALANCED
MARGARET'S MANNER HAD AN EXTRA TINGE OF COLDNESS IN IT WHEN SHE NEXT SPOKE YOU HAVE GOOD CONCERTS HERE I BELIEVE
AND BY RECENT WORK ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF AUTISTIC THOUGHT AND OF SUGGESTION THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE A PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR EVERY MAN WHO DESIRES TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF HIS SOUL
THIS SHAME I SAY BETRAYED THE WANT OF A SECURE RESTING PLACE FOR HER AFFECTION SHE NEVER CALLED HER SON BY ANY NAME BUT JOHN LOVE AND DEAR AND SUCH LIKE TERMS WERE RESERVED FOR FANNY
MISTER THORNTON HAD HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN WORKING UP HIS MOTHER TO THE DESIRED POINT OF CIVILITY SHE DID NOT OFTEN MAKE CALLS AND WHEN SHE DID IT WAS IN HEAVY STATE THAT SHE WENT THROUGH HER DUTIES
THIS BOOK OWES ITS ORIGIN TO THE FACT THAT IN THE AUTUMN OF NINETEEN TWENTY ONE THE AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE OXFORD INVITED ME TO DELIVER THE INAUGURAL COURSE OF A LECTURESHIP IN RELIGION NEWLY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE WILL OF THE LATE PROFESSOR UPTON
A WHITE CHIP BONNET OH DOZENS OF THINGS FOR THE WEDDING AND HUNDREDS OF THINGS FOR THE HOUSE MARGARET ONLY KNEW THAT HER MOTHER HAD NOT FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO COME
HE WOULD BE DEPRESSED FOR MANY DAYS AFTER WITNESSING A DEATH BED OR HEARING OF ANY CRIME BUT NOW MARGARET NOTICED AN ABSENCE OF MIND AS IF HIS THOUGHTS WERE PRE OCCUPIED BY SOME SUBJECT
HER DEAR FATHER LEANING BACK ASLEEP IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE HIS BLUE BLACK HAIR WAS GREY NOW AND LAY THINLY OVER HIS BROWS THE BONES OF HIS FACE WERE PLAINLY TO BE SEEN
WITH THE HEALTHY SHAME OF A CHILD SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HER KEENNESS OF SIGHT IN PERCEIVING THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE THERE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER ALWAYS SO KIND AND TENDER TOWARDS HER
ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
IF WE ONLY LIVED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARISH IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THERE WE SHOULD BE ALMOST WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE STANSFIELDS CERTAINLY THE GORMANS WOULD BE WITHIN A WALK GORMANS SAID MARGARET
MISSUS THORNTON WAS SILENT AFTER THIS FOR HER LAST WORDS BORE RELATION TO A SUBJECT WHICH MORTIFIED HER SHE HAD AN UNCONSCIOUS CONTEMPT FOR A WEAK CHARACTER AND FANNY WAS WEAK IN THE VERY POINTS IN WHICH HER MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE STRONG
SHE HAD LEARNT DRAWING WITH EDITH AND SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY REGRETTED DURING THE GLOOM OF THE BAD WEATHER HER IDLE REVELLING IN THE BEAUTY OF THE WOODLANDS WHILE IT HAD YET BEEN FINE TO MAKE HER DETERMINED TO SKETCH WHAT SHE COULD
NOW THERE WERE ONLY THE WELL BOUND LITTLE READ ENGLISH CLASSICS WHICH WERE WEEDED OUT OF HER FATHER'S LIBRARY TO FILL UP THE SMALL BOOK SHELVES IN THE DRAWING ROOM THOMSON'S SEASONS HAYLEY'S COWPER MIDDLETON'S CICERO
SHE WILL DO YOU NO GOOD I SEE THE MOTHER LOOKS VERY ILL AND SEEMS A NICE QUIET KIND OF PERSON
THE FERN BELOW THEM CAUGHT ALL THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS THE WEATHER WAS SULTRY AND BROODINGLY STILL MARGARET USED TO TRAMP ALONG BY HER FATHER'S SIDE CRUSHING DOWN THE FERN WITH A CRUEL GLEE
CARRIED DAINTY MESSES TO THEIR SICK RESOLVED BEFORE LONG TO TEACH AT THE SCHOOL WHERE HER FATHER WENT EVERY DAY AS TO AN APPOINTED TASK BUT SHE WAS CONTINUALLY TEMPTED OFF TO GO AND SEE SOME INDIVIDUAL FRIEND
A SIGNAL WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD OFTEN TO BE REPEATED BEFORE ANY ONE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO THE HOUR OF THE DAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS AND ATTEND TO HIM NOW MISTER HALE LOITERED ABOUT THE GARDEN IF THE MORNING WAS FINE AND IF NOT
BUT SURELY IT IS A VERY EASY JOURNEY TO LONDON YES BUT SOMEHOW SAID FANNY LOWERING HER VOICE MAMMA HAS NEVER BEEN TO LONDON HERSELF AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY LONGING
MISSUS THORNTON WAS SHY IT WAS ONLY OF LATE YEARS THAT SHE HAD HAD LEISURE ENOUGH IN HER LIFE TO GO INTO SOCIETY AND AS SOCIETY SHE DID NOT ENJOY IT
WAS OF AN IVORY SMOOTHNESS AND DELICACY IF THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS IN GENERAL TOO DIGNIFIED AND RESERVED FOR ONE SO YOUNG NOW TALKING TO HER FATHER IT WAS BRIGHT AS THE MORNING
AND HAD DISCOURAGED HER HUSBAND VERY EARLY IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE IN HIS DESIRE OF READING ALOUD TO HER WHILE SHE WORKED AT ONE TIME THEY HAD TRIED BACKGAMMON AS A RESOURCE BUT AS MISTER HALE GREW TO TAKE AN INCREASING INTEREST IN HIS SCHOOL AND HIS PARISHIONERS
CHAPTER TWO ROSES AND THORNS BY THE SOFT GREEN LIGHT IN THE WOODY GLADE ON THE BANKS OF MOSS WHERE THY CHILDHOOD PLAYED BY THE HOUSEHOLD TREE
MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN SOME COTTAGE IN THE GREEN SHADE OF THE FOREST HER OUT OF DOORS LIFE WAS PERFECT HER IN DOORS LIFE HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
NOT ABSOLUTELY BASED ON A KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS IS EASILY BANISHED FOR A TIME BY A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY OR SOME HAPPY OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHEN THE BRILLIANT FOURTEEN FINE DAYS OF OCTOBER CAME ON
ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES MISTER HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
BUT ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY LADY BERESFORD AS LADIES MAID TO SIR JOHN'S WARDS THE PRETTY MISS BERESFORDS THE BELLES OF RUTLANDSHIRE
I WISH I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT FROM AUNT SHAW I ONLY KNEW HE COULD NOT COME BACK TO ENGLAND BECAUSE OF THAT TERRIBLE AFFAIR POOR DEAR PAPA HOW SAD HE LOOKS
HALF CONFIDENTIAL SHAKE OF THE HEAD TO THE PARSON WHO WATCHED HIM AWAY BEYOND THE SWEET BRIAR HEDGE AND PAST THE GREAT ARBUTUS BEFORE HE TURNED INTO THE ROOM TO BEGIN HIS DAY'S WORK WITH ALL THE SIGNS OF A HEAVY HEART
THIS LIFE AT LEAST THESE WALKS REALISED ALL MARGARET'S ANTICIPATIONS SHE TOOK A PRIDE IN HER FOREST ITS PEOPLE WERE HER PEOPLE SHE MADE HEARTY FRIENDS WITH THEM
AND WAS WANTED EVERYWHERE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME HER MIND AND BODY ACHED NOW WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF ALL SHE HAD DONE AND SAID WITHIN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS THE FAREWELLS SO HURRIEDLY TAKEN AMONGST ALL THE OTHER GOOD BYES
AND TO INDICATE SOME OF THE RESULTS WHICH MIGHT FOLLOW UPON ITS HEALTHY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO POINT OUT THAT EACH OF THESE SUBJECTS NEEDS AT LEAST A VOLUME TO ITSELF
IN A CONDITION WHICH COMPELLED ME TO MAKE MERCHANDISE OF SCIENCE FOR THE BETTERING OF MY FORTUNE AND THOUGH I MIGHT NOT PROFESS TO SCORN GLORY AS A CYNIC
I DO BELIEVE THERE'S SOME ONE IN THERE THEY ALL KEPT STILL A MOMENT THEN THE DOCTOR SAID YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN TOO TOO I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING
BUT WE ARE QUITE CERTAIN HE HASN'T BEEN DROWNED IN THE SEA SO THE DOCTOR RAN DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE NEWS AND TOLD THE NEPHEW WHO CLAPPED HIS HANDS WITH HAPPINESS AND THE PUSHMI PULLYU TOOK THE LITTLE BOY ON HIS BACK AND GAVE HIM A RIDE ROUND THE DINING ROOM TABLE
AS ALSO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SOUL OF MAN AND THAT OF THE BRUTES AND IN THE LAST WHAT THE AUTHOR BELIEVES TO BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO GREATER ADVANCEMENT IN THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE THAN HAS YET BEEN MADE WITH THE REASONS THAT HAVE INDUCED HIM TO WRITE
BUT AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THE ENTIRE COURSE OF STUDY AT THE CLOSE OF WHICH IT IS CUSTOMARY TO BE ADMITTED INTO THE ORDER OF THE LEARNED I COMPLETELY CHANGED MY OPINION FOR I FOUND MYSELF INVOLVED IN SO MANY DOUBTS AND ERRORS
WHILE BUSIED ONLY IN CONSIDERING THE MANNERS OF OTHER MEN I FOUND HERE TOO SCARCE ANY GROUND FOR SETTLED CONVICTION AND REMARKED HARDLY LESS CONTRADICTION AMONG THEM THAN IN THE OPINIONS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS
THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER
THERE ARE THICK SOFT CARPETS ON THE FLOORS THE DISHES ARE MADE OF SILVER AND THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT AND DRINK SPECIAL THINGS
BUT SOLELY TO DESCRIBE THE WAY IN WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO CONDUCT MY OWN THEY WHO SET THEMSELVES TO GIVE PRECEPTS MUST OF COURSE REGARD THEMSELVES AS POSSESSED OF GREATER SKILL THAN THOSE TO WHOM THEY PRESCRIBE
WHAT I'M DOING NOW
TO HOLD IN ESTEEM THE STUDIES OF THE SCHOOLS I WAS AWARE THAT THE LANGUAGES TAUGHT IN THEM ARE NECESSARY TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE WRITINGS OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE GRACE OF FABLE STIRS THE MIND THAT THE MEMORABLE DEEDS OF HISTORY ELEVATE IT AND
SO THEY ALL CAME BACK TO THE DOOR AND JIP PEERED THROUGH THE KEY HOLE BUT SOMETHING HAD BEEN STOOD AGAINST THE WALL ON THE INSIDE AND HE COULD SEE NOTHING WHILE THEY WERE STANDING AROUND WONDERING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO THE OWL
SAID THE OWL SH THERE IT IS AGAIN DON'T YOU HEAR THAT NO I DO NOT SAID THE DOCTOR WHAT KIND OF A SOUND IS IT
SUCH IGNORANCE SNIFFED TOO TOO A DROP OF WATER FALLING OFF THE CEILING WOULD HAVE MADE TEN TIMES AS MUCH NOISE WELL SAID THE DOCTOR
THAT MAY BE UPHELD BY LEARNED MEN WHILE THERE CAN BE BUT ONE TRUE I RECKONED AS WELL NIGH FALSE ALL THAT WAS ONLY PROBABLE AS TO THE OTHER SCIENCES
I YET MADE VERY SLIGHT ACCOUNT OF THAT HONOR WHICH I HOPED TO ACQUIRE ONLY THROUGH FICTITIOUS TITLES AND IN FINE OF FALSE SCIENCES I THOUGHT I KNEW THE WORTH SUFFICIENTLY TO ESCAPE BEING DECEIVED BY THE PROFESSIONS OF AN ALCHEMIST THE PREDICTIONS OF AN ASTROLOGER
I LEARNED TO ENTERTAIN TOO DECIDED A BELIEF IN REGARD TO NOTHING OF THE TRUTH OF WHICH I HAD BEEN PERSUADED MERELY BY EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM AND THUS
I WAS THUS LED TO TAKE THE LIBERTY OF JUDGING OF ALL OTHER MEN BY MYSELF AND OF CONCLUDING THAT THERE WAS NO SCIENCE IN EXISTENCE THAT WAS OF SUCH A NATURE AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN GIVEN TO BELIEVE I STILL CONTINUED HOWEVER
THAT PHILOSOPHY AFFORDS THE MEANS OF DISCOURSING WITH AN APPEARANCE OF TRUTH ON ALL MATTERS AND COMMANDS THE ADMIRATION OF THE MORE SIMPLE THAT JURISPRUDENCE MEDICINE AND THE OTHER SCIENCES SECURE FOR THEIR CULTIVATORS HONORS AND RICHES AND IN FINE
COME DOWN AND SEE IF YOU CAN LET US IN SO THE DOCTOR WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND HE SAW THAT IT WAS INDEED A BEAUTIFUL SHIP HE FOUND THE ANIMALS GATHERED ROUND A LITTLE DOOR ALL TALKING AT ONCE TRYING TO GUESS WHAT WAS INSIDE
SAID THE PORPOISES FOR WE SAW IT LYING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA BUT THERE WAS NOBODY INSIDE IT BECAUSE WE WENT AND LOOKED HIS LITTLE NEPHEW IS ON THE SHIP WITH ME HERE SAID THE DOCTOR AND HE IS TERRIBLY AFRAID THAT THE PIRATES THREW HIS UNCLE INTO THE SEA
THAN THAT THEY FOSTER HIS VANITY THE BETTER THE MORE REMOTE THEY ARE FROM COMMON SENSE REQUIRING AS THEY MUST IN THIS CASE THE EXERCISE OF GREATER INGENUITY AND ART TO RENDER THEM PROBABLE IN ADDITION
THE ROOM WAS QUITE SMALL NO WINDOW THE CEILING LOW FOR FURNITURE THERE WAS ONLY ONE LITTLE STOOL
SIX WINE GLASSES WITH TURQUOISE AND SILVER ROUND THE RIMS AND A LOVELY GREAT SUGAR BOWL MADE OF MOTHER O PEARL BUT NOWHERE IN THE WHOLE BOAT COULD THEY FIND A KEY TO FIT THAT LOCK
AND WENT UPSTAIRS TO LOOK FOR PASSING PORPOISES AND SOON A WHOLE SCHOOL CAME DANCING AND JUMPING THROUGH THE WATER ON THEIR WAY TO BRAZIL WHEN THEY SAW THE DOCTOR LEANING ON THE RAIL OF HIS SHIP THEY CAME OVER TO SEE HOW HE WAS GETTING ON
AND IF THEY ERR IN THE SLIGHTEST PARTICULAR THEY SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO CENSURE BUT AS THIS TRACT IS PUT FORTH MERELY AS A HISTORY OR IF YOU WILL AS A TALE IN WHICH AMID SOME EXAMPLES WORTHY OF IMITATION
THEY LOOKED IN ALL THE CUPBOARDS AND DRAWERS AND LOCKERS IN THE BIG CHESTS IN THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM THEY LOOKED EVERYWHERE WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS THEY DISCOVERED A LOT OF NEW AND WONDERFUL THINGS THAT THE PIRATES MUST HAVE STOLEN FROM OTHER SHIPS
EVERYTHING MAKES SOME NOISE IF YOUR EARS ARE ONLY SHARP ENOUGH TO CATCH IT BATS CAN HEAR A MOLE WALKING IN HIS TUNNEL UNDER THE EARTH
PARDON ME BUT I CAN SAID TOO TOO I TELL YOU THERE IS SOME ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET ALMOST
WHAT'S CUTTERIGSLOOP WHISPERED GUB GUB TURNING TO JIP SH THAT'S THE KIND OF A SHIP THE MAN HAD SAID JIP
THE IMPOSTURES OF A MAGICIAN OR BY THE ARTIFICES AND BOASTING OF ANY OF THOSE WHO PROFESS TO KNOW THINGS OF WHICH THEY ARE IGNORANT FOR THESE REASONS AS SOON AS MY AGE PERMITTED ME TO PASS FROM UNDER THE CONTROL OF MY INSTRUCTORS
TOO TOO THE LISTENER HAVING THANKED THE SHARKS AGAIN FOR THEIR KINDNESS THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS SET OFF ONCE MORE ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME IN THE SWIFT SHIP WITH THE THREE RED SAILS AS THEY MOVED OUT INTO THE OPEN SEA
AFTER A MOMENT TOO TOO SAID
DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND MY UNCLE FOR ME WELL WE ARE GOING TO TRY VERY HARD SAID THE DOCTOR NOW WHAT WAS YOUR UNCLE LIKE TO LOOK AT HE HAD RED HAIR THE BOY ANSWERED VERY RED HAIR
THE ANIMALS ALL WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT THEIR NEW BOAT WAS LIKE INSIDE WHILE THE DOCTOR LEANT ON THE RAIL AT THE BACK OF THE SHIP WITH A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH WATCHING THE CANARY ISLANDS FADE AWAY IN THE BLUE DUSK OF THE EVENING
OF PHILOSOPHY I WILL SAY NOTHING EXCEPT THAT WHEN I SAW THAT IT HAD BEEN CULTIVATED FOR MANY AGES BY THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN AND THAT YET THERE IS NOT A SINGLE MATTER WITHIN ITS SPHERE WHICH IS NOT STILL IN DISPUTE
AND IN THE FIRST WILL BE FOUND VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING THE SCIENCES IN THE SECOND THE PRINCIPAL RULES OF THE METHOD WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS DISCOVERED IN THE THIRD CERTAIN OF THE RULES OF MORALS WHICH HE HAS DEDUCED FROM THIS METHOD IN THE FOURTH
THAT IT IS USEFUL TO BESTOW SOME ATTENTION UPON ALL EVEN UPON THOSE ABOUNDING THE MOST IN SUPERSTITION AND ERROR THAT WE MAY BE IN A POSITION TO DETERMINE THEIR REAL VALUE AND GUARD AGAINST BEING DECEIVED
MY UNCLE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN I ASKED THE PIRATES WHERE HE WAS BUT THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID THEY THREW HIM INTO THE SEA AND DROWNED HIM
ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THINK LOWLY ENOUGH OF MYSELF AND ALTHOUGH WHEN I LOOK WITH THE EYE OF A PHILOSOPHER AT THE VARIED COURSES AND PURSUITS OF MANKIND AT LARGE I FIND SCARCELY ONE WHICH DOES NOT APPEAR IN VAIN AND USELESS
AND BE PREVENTED FROM THINKING THAT EVERYTHING CONTRARY TO OUR CUSTOMS IS RIDICULOUS AND IRRATIONAL A CONCLUSION USUALLY COME TO BY THOSE WHOSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN TOO MUCH TIME IS OCCUPIED IN TRAVELING
AND THOSE WHO TRAVEL VERY SLOWLY MAY YET MAKE FAR GREATER PROGRESS PROVIDED THEY KEEP ALWAYS TO THE STRAIGHT ROAD THAN THOSE WHO WHILE THEY RUN FORSAKE IT
PREFATORY NOTE BY THE AUTHOR IF THIS DISCOURSE APPEAR TOO LONG TO BE READ AT ONCE IT MAY BE DIVIDED INTO SIX PARTS
EMBROIDERED WITH FLOWERS OF GOLD JARS OF FINE TOBACCO FROM JAMAICA CARVED IVORY BOXES FULL OF RUSSIAN TEA AN OLD VIOLIN WITH A STRING BROKEN AND A PICTURE ON THE BACK
I MYSELF MAY HAVE A NEW HELP TOWARDS INSTRUCTION TO BE ADDED TO THOSE I HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF EMPLOYING MY PRESENT DESIGN THEN IS NOT TO TEACH THE METHOD WHICH EACH OUGHT TO FOLLOW FOR THE RIGHT CONDUCT OF HIS REASON
AND I THOUGHT THAT IN ORDER COMPETENTLY TO UNDERTAKE THEIR EXAMINATION THERE WAS NEED OF SOME SPECIAL HELP FROM HEAVEN AND OF BEING MORE THAN MAN
THE MAN IN THERE IS UNHAPPY HE WEEPS HE HAS TAKEN CARE NOT TO BLUBBER OR SNIFFLE LEST WE SHOULD FIND OUT THAT HE IS CRYING BUT I HEARD
I HEAR THE NOISE OF SOME ONE PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET SAID THE OWL BUT THAT MAKES HARDLY ANY SOUND AT ALL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU COULDN'T HEAR THAT OUT HERE
EVERYBODY QUITE STILL SHUT YOUR EYES AND DON'T BREATHE TOO TOO LEANED DOWN AND LISTENED AGAIN VERY HARD AND LONG AT LAST HE LOOKED UP INTO THE DOCTOR'S FACE AND SAID
AND THE ISSUE OF WHICH MUST PRESENTLY PUNISH HIM IF HE HAS JUDGED AMISS THAN IN THOSE CONDUCTED BY A MAN OF LETTERS IN HIS STUDY REGARDING SPECULATIVE MATTERS THAT ARE OF NO PRACTICAL MOMENT AND FOLLOWED BY NO CONSEQUENCES TO HIMSELF FARTHER PERHAPS
IN MAKING SUCH REFLECTION ON THE MATTER OF MY EXPERIENCE AS TO SECURE MY IMPROVEMENT FOR IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD FIND MUCH MORE TRUTH IN THE REASONINGS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL WITH REFERENCE TO THE AFFAIRS IN WHICH HE IS PERSONALLY INTERESTED
WHICH IS PROPERLY WHAT IS CALLED GOOD SENSE OR REASON IS BY NATURE EQUAL IN ALL MEN
GOOD SENSE IS OF ALL THINGS AMONG MEN THE MOST EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED FOR EVERY ONE THINKS HIMSELF SO ABUNDANTLY PROVIDED WITH IT
I JUDGED THAT NO SOLID SUPERSTRUCTURES COULD BE REARED ON FOUNDATIONS SO INFIRM AND NEITHER THE HONOR NOR THE GAIN HELD OUT BY THEM WAS SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE ME TO THEIR CULTIVATION FOR I WAS NOT THANK HEAVEN
IF THE POOR FELLOW'S UNHAPPY WE'VE GOT TO GET IN AND SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM
AND WHEN THEY HAD GONE INTO THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM AND WERE HAVING TEA DAB DAB CAME UP BEHIND THE DOCTOR'S CHAIR AND WHISPERED ASK THE PORPOISES IF THE BOY'S UNCLE WAS DROWNED THEY'LL KNOW ALL RIGHT SAID THE DOCTOR
OR IN FULLNESS AND READINESS OF MEMORY AND BESIDES THESE I KNOW OF NO OTHER QUALITIES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PERFECTION OF THE MIND
HE ISN'T DROWNED SAID THE PORPOISES IF HE WERE WE WOULD BE SURE TO HAVE HEARD OF IT FROM THE DEEP SEA DECAPODS WE HEAR ALL THE SALT WATER NEWS THE SHELL FISH CALL US THE OCEAN GOSSIPS NO TELL THE LITTLE BOY WE ARE SORRY WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE HIS UNCLE IS
IF SUCH WERE ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND I HAD BEEN TAUGHT ALL THAT OTHERS LEARNED THERE AND NOT CONTENTED WITH THE SCIENCES ACTUALLY TAUGHT US I HAD IN ADDITION READ ALL THE BOOKS THAT HAD FALLEN INTO MY HANDS
A SET OF BIG CHESS MEN CARVED OUT OF CORAL AND AMBER A WALKING STICK WHICH HAD A SWORD INSIDE
TAKING A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AND JAM WHAT ARE THOSE FUNNY CLICKING NOISES YOU ARE MAKING WITH YOUR TONGUE ASKED THE BOY OH I JUST SAID A COUPLE OF WORDS IN DUCK LANGUAGE THE DOCTOR ANSWERED
THE OCEAN GOSSIPS RIGHT AWAY AN AXE WAS FOUND AND THE DOCTOR SOON CHOPPED A HOLE IN THE DOOR BIG ENOUGH TO CLAMBER THROUGH AT FIRST HE COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL IT WAS SO DARK INSIDE SO HE STRUCK A MATCH
IF READ WITH DISCRETION AID IN FORMING THE JUDGMENT THAT THE PERUSAL OF ALL EXCELLENT BOOKS IS AS IT WERE TO INTERVIEW WITH THE NOBLEST MEN OF PAST AGES WHO HAVE WRITTEN THEM AND EVEN A STUDIED INTERVIEW IN WHICH ARE DISCOVERED TO US
AND DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE BRUTES I AM DISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS TO BE FOUND COMPLETE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL AND ON THIS POINT TO ADOPT THE COMMON OPINION OF PHILOSOPHERS WHO SAY THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF GREATER AND LESS HOLDS ONLY AMONG THE ACCIDENTS
AND THE LITTLE BOY BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN WELL NOW WAIT A MINUTE SAID THE DOCTOR DON'T CRY LET'S GO AND HAVE TEA IN THE DINING ROOM AND WE'LL TALK IT OVER MAYBE YOUR UNCLE IS QUITE SAFE ALL THE TIME
KEEP STILL CAN'T YOU OH SAID THE PIG IS THAT ALL I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING TO DRINK SO THE DOCTOR LEFT THE BOY TO PLAY WITH THE ANIMALS IN THE DINING ROOM
I ESTEEMED ELOQUENCE HIGHLY AND WAS IN RAPTURES WITH POESY BUT I THOUGHT THAT BOTH WERE GIFTS OF NATURE RATHER THAN FRUITS OF STUDY THOSE IN WHOM THE FACULTY OF REASON IS PREDOMINANT AND WHO MOST SKILLFULLY DISPOSE THEIR THOUGHTS WITH A VIEW TO RENDER THEM CLEAR AND INTELLIGIBLE
USING ONLY ONE EAR THE COLOR OF A KITTEN FROM THE WAY IT WINKS IN THE DARK WELL WELL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU SURPRISE ME THAT'S VERY INTERESTING
THERE WILL BE FOUND PERHAPS AS MANY MORE WHICH IT WERE ADVISABLE NOT TO FOLLOW I HOPE IT WILL PROVE USEFUL TO SOME WITHOUT BEING HURTFUL TO ANY AND THAT MY OPENNESS WILL FIND SOME FAVOR WITH ALL
AND WHO CAN GIVE EXPRESSION TO THEM WITH THE GREATEST EMBELLISHMENT AND HARMONY ARE STILL THE BEST POETS THOUGH UNACQUAINTED WITH THE ART OF POETRY I WAS ESPECIALLY DELIGHTED WITH THE MATHEMATICS ON ACCOUNT OF THE CERTITUDE AND EVIDENCE OF THEIR REASONINGS
OF GRADUALLY AUGMENTING MY KNOWLEDGE AND OF RAISING IT BY LITTLE AND LITTLE TO THE HIGHEST POINT WHICH THE MEDIOCRITY OF MY TALENTS AND THE BRIEF DURATION OF MY LIFE WILL PERMIT ME TO REACH FOR I HAVE ALREADY REAPED FROM IT SUCH FRUITS THAT
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD CRYING BITTERLY
I GRADUALLY EXTRICATED MYSELF FROM MANY ERRORS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DARKEN OUR NATURAL INTELLIGENCE AND INCAPACITATE US IN GREAT MEASURE FROM LISTENING TO REASON BUT AFTER I HAD BEEN OCCUPIED SEVERAL YEARS IN THUS STUDYING THE BOOK OF THE WORLD
AND IT IS BUT A LITTLE COPPER AND GLASS PERHAPS THAT I TAKE FOR GOLD AND DIAMONDS I KNOW HOW VERY LIABLE WE ARE TO DELUSION IN WHAT RELATES TO OURSELVES AND ALSO HOW MUCH THE JUDGMENTS OF OUR FRIENDS ARE TO BE SUSPECTED WHEN GIVEN IN OUR FAVOR
AND THAT'S SOMETHING PERHAPS WE CAN FIND HIM FOR YOU FIRST WE'LL GO AND HAVE TEA WITH STRAWBERRY JAM
ASKED THE PORPOISES YES SAID THE DOCTOR THAT'S THE MAN HAS HE BEEN DROWNED
AND SAID THEY WOULD THROW MY UNCLE INTO THE SEA IF HE DIDN'T DO AS THEY SAID THEY SENT ME DOWNSTAIRS AND I HEARD THE NOISE OF A FIGHT GOING ON ABOVE AND WHEN THEY LET ME COME UP AGAIN NEXT DAY
NOW HE PUSHES HIS HAIR BACK OFF HIS FOREHEAD IT'S A MAN ALL RIGHT WOMEN SOMETIMES DO THAT SAID THE DOCTOR TRUE SAID THE OWL
THE PIRATES SHUT ME IN THERE WHEN THEY WERE GOING OFF TO STEAL THINGS FROM ANOTHER SHIP WHEN I HEARD SOME ONE CHOPPING ON THE DOOR I DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT COULD BE I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND IT WAS YOU
AND THE DOCTOR ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF A MAN WITH RED HAIR AND AN ANCHOR TATTOOED ON HIS ARM
BUT I BELIEVED THAT I HAD ALREADY GIVEN SUFFICIENT TIME TO LANGUAGES AND LIKEWISE TO THE READING OF THE WRITINGS OF THE ANCIENTS TO THEIR HISTORIES AND FABLES
ON THE OTHER HAND I COMPARED THE DISQUISITIONS OF THE ANCIENT MORALISTS TO VERY TOWERING AND MAGNIFICENT PALACES WITH NO BETTER FOUNDATION THAN SAND AND MUD THEY LAUD THE VIRTUES VERY HIGHLY AND EXHIBIT THEM AS ESTIMABLE FAR ABOVE ANYTHING ON EARTH
SAID JIP IN A WHISPER YES VERY RUM SAID GUB GUB THE SMELL MAKES ME GIDDY
BUT HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A PIRATE BECAUSE KILLING PEOPLE AND STEALING WAS NO WORK FOR A GOOD FISHERMAN TO DO THEN THE LEADER BEN ALI GOT VERY ANGRY AND GNASHED HIS TEETH
FOR TO HOLD CONVERSE WITH THOSE OF OTHER AGES AND TO TRAVEL ARE ALMOST THE SAME THING IT IS USEFUL TO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE MANNERS OF DIFFERENT NATIONS THAT WE MAY BE ENABLED TO FORM A MORE CORRECT JUDGMENT REGARDING OUR OWN
LISTEN AGAIN AND TELL ME WHAT HE'S DOING NOW I'M NOT SURE YET SAID TOO TOO IF IT'S A MAN AT ALL MAYBE IT'S A WOMAN
SH THE DOCTOR WHISPERED THAT IS THE PUSHMI PULLYU DON'T LET HIM SEE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM HE GETS SO DREADFULLY EMBARRASSED TELL ME HOW DID YOU COME TO BE LOCKED UP IN THAT LITTLE ROOM
FROM MY CHILDHOOD I HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH LETTERS AND AS I WAS GIVEN TO BELIEVE THAT BY THEIR HELP A CLEAR AND CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THAT IS USEFUL IN LIFE MIGHT BE ACQUIRED I WAS ARDENTLY DESIROUS OF INSTRUCTION
WHILE HE WAS STANDING THERE WONDERING HOW THE MONKEYS WERE GETTING ON AND WHAT HIS GARDEN WOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN HE GOT BACK TO PUDDLEBY
WE BECOME STRANGERS TO OUR NATIVE COUNTRY AND THE OVER CURIOUS IN THE CUSTOMS OF THE PAST ARE GENERALLY IGNORANT OF THOSE OF THE PRESENT BESIDES FICTITIOUS NARRATIVES LEAD US TO IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITY OF MANY EVENTS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE
NOW ALL HOLD YOUR BREATH A MOMENT SO I CAN LISTEN WELL
I ENTIRELY ABANDONED THE STUDY OF LETTERS AND RESOLVED NO LONGER TO SEEK ANY OTHER SCIENCE THAN THE KNOWLEDGE OF MYSELF OR OF THE GREAT BOOK OF THE WORLD I SPENT THE REMAINDER OF MY YOUTH IN TRAVELING IN VISITING COURTS AND ARMIES
DOOR LOCKED AND WE ARE ALL CRAZY TO GET IN AND SEE WHAT'S INSIDE JIP SAYS IT MUST BE WHERE THE PIRATES KEPT THEIR TREASURE BUT WE
HENCE IT HAPPENS THAT THE REMAINDER DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TRUTH AND THAT SUCH AS REGULATE THEIR CONDUCT BY EXAMPLES DRAWN FROM THIS SOURCE ARE APT TO FALL INTO THE EXTRAVAGANCES OF THE KNIGHT ERRANTS OF ROMANCE AND TO ENTERTAIN PROJECTS THAT EXCEED THEIR POWERS
THE LITTLE BOY SEEMED RATHER FRIGHTENED TO FIND A MAN STANDING THERE BEFORE HIM AND ALL THOSE ANIMALS STARING IN THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE BROKEN DOOR BUT AS SOON AS HE SAW JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MATCH HE STOPPED CRYING AND GOT UP
AND THE PICTURE OF AN ANCHOR TATTOOED ON HIS ARM HE WAS A STRONG MAN A KIND UNCLE AND THE BEST SAILOR IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC HIS FISHING BOAT WAS CALLED THE SAUCY SALLY A CUTTER RIGGED SLOOP
WHICH ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF HIS METAPHYSIC IN THE FIFTH THE ORDER OF THE PHYSICAL QUESTIONS WHICH HE HAS INVESTIGATED AND IN PARTICULAR THE EXPLICATION OF THE MOTION OF THE HEART AND OF SOME OTHER DIFFICULTIES PERTAINING TO MEDICINE
WOULD YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO FIND OUT FOR ME FOR SURE WHETHER HE HAS BEEN DROWNED OR NOT
BUT I SHALL ENDEAVOR IN THIS DISCOURSE TO DESCRIBE THE PATHS I HAVE FOLLOWED AND TO DELINEATE MY LIFE AS IN A PICTURE IN ORDER THAT EACH ONE MAY ALSO BE ABLE TO JUDGE OF THEM FOR HIMSELF AND THAT IN THE GENERAL OPINION ENTERTAINED OF THEM AS GATHERED FROM CURRENT REPORT
FOR MYSELF I HAVE NEVER FANCIED MY MIND TO BE IN ANY RESPECT MORE PERFECT THAN THOSE OF THE GENERALITY ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE OFTEN WISHED THAT I WERE EQUAL TO SOME OTHERS IN PROMPTITUDE OF THOUGHT OR IN CLEARNESS AND DISTINCTNESS OF IMAGINATION
BUT WHEN THEY DO THEIR LONG HAIR MAKES QUITE A DIFFERENT SOUND
ARE ALWAYS THE BEST ABLE TO PERSUADE OTHERS OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT THEY LAY DOWN THOUGH THEY SHOULD SPEAK ONLY IN THE LANGUAGE OF LOWER BRITTANY AND BE WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE RULES OF RHETORIC AND THOSE WHOSE MINDS ARE STORED WITH THE MOST AGREEABLE FANCIES
THE DOCTOR TURNED THE HANDLE BUT IT WOULDN'T OPEN THEN THEY ALL STARTED TO HUNT FOR THE KEY THEY LOOKED UNDER THE MAT
WHEN THE PIRATES CAME AND CAUGHT US THEY SUNK OUR FISHING BOAT AND BROUGHT US BOTH ON TO THIS SHIP THEY TOLD MY UNCLE THAT THEY WANTED HIM TO BE A PIRATE LIKE THEM FOR HE WAS CLEVER AT SAILING A SHIP IN ALL WEATHERS
YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT IN YOUR LIFE
AND IN ESSAYING TO GATHER SOME EXPERIENCE I AT LENGTH RESOLVED TO MAKE MYSELF AN OBJECT OF STUDY AND TO EMPLOY ALL THE POWERS OF MY MIND IN CHOOSING THE PATHS I OUGHT TO FOLLOW
ONLY THEIR CHOICEST THOUGHTS THAT ELOQUENCE HAS INCOMPARABLE FORCE AND BEAUTY THAT POESY HAS ITS RAVISHING GRACES AND DELIGHTS THAT IN THE MATHEMATICS THERE ARE MANY REFINED DISCOVERIES EMINENTLY SUITED TO GRATIFY THE INQUISITIVE
TREATING OF SUCH BRANCHES AS ARE ESTEEMED THE MOST CURIOUS AND RARE I KNEW THE JUDGMENT WHICH OTHERS HAD FORMED OF ME AND I DID NOT FIND THAT I WAS CONSIDERED INFERIOR TO MY FELLOWS
AND THEY THINK THEY'RE GOOD HEARERS
FASTENED AT THE BOTTOM SO THEY WOULDN'T TUMBLE WITH THE ROLLING OF THE SHIP AND ABOVE THE BARRELS PEWTER JUGS OF ALL SIZES HUNG FROM WOODEN PEGS THERE WAS A STRONG WINEY SMELL AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SAT A LITTLE BOY
YOU AREN'T ONE OF THE PIRATES ARE YOU HE ASKED AND WHEN THE DOCTOR THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED LONG AND LOUD THE LITTLE BOY SMILED TOO AND CAME AND TOOK HIS HAND YOU LAUGH LIKE A FRIEND
HE SAID NOT LIKE A PIRATE COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE MY UNCLE IS I AM AFRAID I CAN'T SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM LAST IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY SAID THE BOY
AND NOTHING THEREFORE WHICH IS ABOVE DOUBT I DID NOT PRESUME TO ANTICIPATE THAT MY SUCCESS WOULD BE GREATER IN IT THAN THAT OF OTHERS AND FURTHER WHEN I CONSIDERED THE NUMBER OF CONFLICTING OPINIONS TOUCHING A SINGLE MATTER
AND EVEN THE MOST FAITHFUL HISTORIES IF THEY DO NOT WHOLLY MISREPRESENT MATTERS OR EXAGGERATE THEIR IMPORTANCE TO RENDER THE ACCOUNT OF THEM MORE WORTHY OF PERUSAL OMIT AT LEAST ALMOST ALWAYS THE MEANEST AND LEAST STRIKING OF THE ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES
FOR TO BE POSSESSED OF A VIGOROUS MIND IS NOT ENOUGH THE PRIME REQUISITE IS RIGHTLY TO APPLY IT THE GREATEST MINDS AS THEY ARE CAPABLE OF THE HIGHEST EXCELLENCES ARE OPEN LIKEWISE TO THE GREATEST ABERRATIONS
THAT I WAS CONVINCED I HAD ADVANCED NO FARTHER IN ALL MY ATTEMPTS AT LEARNING THAN THE DISCOVERY AT EVERY TURN OF MY OWN IGNORANCE AND YET I WAS STUDYING IN ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED SCHOOLS IN EUROPE IN WHICH I THOUGHT THERE MUST BE LEARNED MEN
THAN THEY ALREADY POSSESS AND IN THIS IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT ALL ARE MISTAKEN THE CONVICTION IS RATHER TO BE HELD AS TESTIFYING THAT THE POWER OF JUDGING ARIGHT AND OF DISTINGUISHING TRUTH FROM ERROR
LIFT ME UP AND LET ME LISTEN AT THE KEY HOLE AND I'LL SOON TELL YOU
THIS IS DAB DAB ONE OF MY PETS I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT DUCKS HAD A LANGUAGE SAID THE BOY ARE ALL THESE OTHER ANIMALS YOUR PETS TOO WHAT IS THAT STRANGE LOOKING THING WITH TWO HEADS
POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
THIS LED TO ANOTHER YOSEMITE EXPEDITION A DETACHMENT OF REGULAR SOLDIERS FROM FORT MILLER UNDER LIEUTENANT MOORE U S A WAS AT ONCE DISPATCHED TO CAPTURE OR PUNISH THE MURDERERS
A SECOND EXPEDITION WAS MADE IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR BOLING WHEN THE VALLEY WAS ENTERED NO INDIANS WERE SEEN BUT THE MANY WIGWAMS WITH SMOLDERING FIRES
BUSIED HERSELF MOST ABOUT IT WHEN LITTLE VANKA'S MOTHER PELAGUEYA WAS STILL ALIVE AND WAS SERVANT WOMAN IN THE HOUSE OLGA IGNATYEVNA USED TO STUFF HIM WITH SUGAR CANDY AND HAVING NOTHING TO DO
BUT EARLY ONE MORNING AFTER A FEAST OF HORSE FLESH A BAND OF MONOS SURPRISED THEM IN THEIR HUTS KILLING TENAYA AND NEARLY ALL HIS TRIBE ONLY A SMALL REMNANT ESCAPED DOWN THE RIVER CANYON
TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY
SAVAGE TOLD TENAYA THAT HE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH FOR INDIANS COULD NOT CROSS THE MOUNTAINS IN THE DEEP SNOW AND THAT HE KNEW THEY MUST STILL BE AT HIS VILLAGE OR HIDING SOMEWHERE NEAR IT
HOW TO SNEAK UP AND TAKE A BITE AT A LEG OR SLIP INTO THE LARDER
WHICH MADE ME THUS UNGENEROUS OF HIS NAME OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE FEELING THAT THE OTHERS WERE NOT WORTHY OF HIM BUT HOW REFRESHING IT WAS WHEN SOME INTELLECTUALLY BLOWN UP STRANGER SAID DO YOU EVER READ SAKI
THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS ERECTED IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AND WAS KEPT AS A HOTEL THE NEXT YEAR BY G A HITE AND LATER BY J H NEAL AND S M CUNNINGHAM
THEY MAKE ME SLEEP IN THE VESTIBULE AND WHEN THEIR BRAT CRIES I DON'T SLEEP AT ALL BUT HAVE TO ROCK THE CRADLE DEAR GRANDPAPA FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TAKE ME AWAY FROM HERE
BUT I HAVE NO BOOTS AND I WAS AFRAID OF THE FROST AND WHEN I GROW UP I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU
SUCH WOES SUCH JARRINGS
MY MASTER DRAGGED ME BY MY HAIR INTO THE YARD AND BELABOURED ME WITH A SHOE MAKER'S STIRRUP BECAUSE
HE WROTE I AM WRITING YOU A LETTER
IN WHICH THE FREE LANCE MIGHT GRADUATE AND HE COULD SPEAK OF HIS ALMA MATER WHETHER THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WITH AS MUCH PRIDE AS HE NEVER DOUBTED THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WOULD SPEAK ONE DAY OF HIM
IS THE WORD PRIVILEGE THE DESIGN WHEN FINALLY DEVELOPED WAS A SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT TO MONSIEUR DEPLIS WHO HAD SUSPECTED ICARUS OF BEING A FORTRESS
ALMOST AS SOON AS HE WAS DISCOVERABLE LET US SPARE A MOMENT AND A TEAR FOR THOSE GOLDEN DAYS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WHEN THERE WERE FIVE LEISURELY PAPERS OF AN EVENING
THEN SPREADING A CRUMPLED SHEET OF PAPER IN FRONT OF HIM HE BEGAN TO WRITE BEFORE HOWEVER DECIDING TO MAKE THE FIRST LETTER HE LOOKED FURTIVELY AT THE DOOR AND AT THE WINDOW GLANCED SEVERAL TIMES AT THE SOMBRE IKON
IF IT BE LAWFUL FIRMLY TO BELIEVE
SO SHE TOOK THE HERRING AND STUCK ITS SNOUT INTO MY FACE THE ASSISTANTS TEASE ME SEND ME TO THE TAVERN FOR VODKA MAKE ME STEAL THE MASTER'S CUCUMBERS AND THE MASTER BEATS ME WITH WHATEVER IS HANDY
WHICH SOME HAVE CLAIMED FOR HIM
IT WAS YOUR PEOPLE WHO ROBBED MY STORES BURNED MY HOUSES AND MURDERED MY MEN IT THEY DO NOT MAKE A TREATY YOUR WHOLE TRIBE WILL BE DESTROYED NOT ONE OF THEM WILL BE LEFT ALIVE TO THIS THE OLD CHIEF REPLIED
HAD GONE OUT TO AN EARLY CHURCH SERVICE TO PROCURE FROM HIS EMPLOYER'S CUPBOARD
FROM WHOM HE HAD INQUIRED THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD TOLD HIM THAT LETTERS WERE TO BE PUT INTO POST BOXES AND FROM THERE THEY WERE CONVEYED OVER THE WHOLE EARTH IN MAIL TROIKAS BY DRUNKEN POST BOYS
HE HAS A CHOICE OF WORDS A WAY OF PUTTING THINGS WHICH IS AS INEVITABLY HIS OWN VINTAGE AS ONCE TASTED IT BECOMES THE PRIVATE VINTAGE OF THE CONNOISSEUR
AND NOW CONSIDER I DO YOU EXHORT IN SUCH COMMOTIONS SO CONTINUAL WHAT REST CAN TAKE THE GLOBE TERRESTRIAL MOST HAPPY THEN ARE THEY THAT CAN IT HOLD AND USE IT CAREFULLY AS PRECIOUS GOLD
AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG THEN FLOG ME LIKE THE GREY GOAT AND IF YOU REALLY THINK I SHAN'T FIND WORK
IF SAKI'S CARELESS CRUELTY THAT STRANGE BOYISH INSENSITIVENESS OF HIS DID NOT GIVE HIM AN UNFAIR START IN THE PURSUIT OF LAUGHTER IT MAY HAVE BEEN SO BUT FORTUNATELY
BY MISTER HUTCHINGS ALL THESE HOTELS HAVE VANISHED EXCEPT THE FRAME HOUSE BUILT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION A LARGE HOTEL BUILT ON THE BRINK OF THE RIVER IN FRONT OF THE OLD ONE
THEREFORE I WILL NOT LIE TO YOU BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME RETURN TO MY PEOPLE I WILL BRING THEM IN HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO THE NEXT DAY HE CAME BACK
AND WE SHALL BE GLAD TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THEM WE WILL STAY HERE AND BE FRIENDS MY PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE PLAINS SOME OF THE TRIBES WHO HAVE GONE THERE ARE VERY BAD WE CANNOT LIVE WITH THEM HERE WE CAN DEFEND OURSELVES
AND WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN BOLING HE SAID IN GREAT EMOTION KILL ME SIR CAPTAIN YES KILL ME AS YOU KILLED MY SON AS YOU WOULD KILL MY PEOPLE IF THEY WERE TO COME TO YOU
INSISTING THAT SHE SHALL SHARE OUR DELIGHT IN THEM AND THERE ARE BOOKS EQUALLY DEAR TO US OF WHICH WE SAY NOTHING FEARING LEST THE PRAISE OF OTHERS
AND VIVIDLY PICTURED TO HIMSELF HIS GRANDFATHER
CONSISTING OF SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN PERSONS THE NEXT YEAR THE REGULAR PLEASURE TRAVEL BEGAN AND A TRAIL ON THE MARIPOSA SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS OPENED BY MANN BROTHERS THIS TRAIL WAS AFTERWARDS PURCHASED BY THE CITIZENS OF THE COUNTY
MY YOUNG MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GOLD DIGGERS WERE OUR ENEMIES
AND THE OTHER COMETH IN THEY BELIEVE THE FIRST THAT SAITH THE BALL WAS OVER OR UNDER THE LINE THE WATERS ARE THE HEATS THAT THE PLAYERS TAKE TILL THEY SWEAT AGAIN THE CORDS OF THE RACKETS ARE MADE OF THE GUTS OF SHEEP OR GOATS
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SPARE THE FLOCKS OF BEASTS THAT INNOCENTEST ARE BUT DID THEIR SINEWS AND THEIR BOWELS TAKE NOT TO THE GODS A SACRIFICE TO MAKE BUT USUALLY TO SERVE THEMSELVES FOR SPORT
THE YOUNG FIR TREES WRAPT IN HOAR FROST STOOD MOTIONLESS WAITING FOR WHICH OF THEM WOULD DIE SUDDENLY A HARE SPRINGING FROM SOMEWHERE WOULD DART OVER THE SNOWDRIFT HIS GRANDFATHER COULD NOT HELP SHOUTING CATCH IT CATCH IT
TENAYA INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF TAKING ALL THE INDIANS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN PLAIN MY PEOPLE
WHO HAD BEEN APPRENTICE TO THE SHOEMAKER ALIAKHIN FOR THREE MONTHS DID NOT GO TO BED THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS
TO THE MAJOR SAVAGE FIRMLY SAID YOUR PEOPLE MUST GO TO THE COMMISSIONERS IF THEY DO NOT YOUR YOUNG MEN WILL AGAIN STEAL HORSES AND KILL AND PLUNDER THE WHITES
WHICH WAS NOT IN THE BOYISH SAKI'S EQUIPMENT HE LEAVES LOOSE ENDS EVERYWHERE NOR IN HIS DIALOGUE DELIGHTFUL AS IT OFTEN IS FUNNY AS IT NEARLY ALWAYS IS IS HE THE SUPREME MASTER
SAID GARGANTUA THE PROGRESS AND CARRYING ON OF THE DIVINE TRUTH BY SAINT GODERAN SAID THE MONK THAT IS NOT MY EXPOSITION IT IS THE STYLE OF THE PROPHET MERLIN
VANKA DID THE SAME THEN BEFORE CUTTING DOWN THE CHRISTMAS TREE HIS GRANDFATHER SMOKED HIS PIPE TOOK A LONG PINCH OF SNUFF AND MADE FUN OF POOR FROZEN LITTLE VANKA
THOUGH IT BE AT HAND YEA AND BEFORE THERE SHALL APPEAR A RACE OF MEN WHO LOTH TO SIT STILL IN ONE PLACE SHALL BOLDLY GO BEFORE ALL PEOPLE'S EYES SUBORNING MEN OF DIVERS QUALITIES TO DRAW THEM
MAKE UPON IT AS MANY GRAVE ALLEGORIES AND GLOSSES AS YOU WILL AND DOTE UPON IT YOU AND THE REST OF THE WORLD AS LONG AS YOU PLEASE FOR MY PART
O HE IS WORTHY PRAISE THAT SHRINKETH NOT NO SOONER WAS THIS ENIGMATICAL MONUMENT READ OVER BUT GARGANTUA FETCHING A VERY DEEP SIGH SAID UNTO THOSE THAT STOOD BY
WHEN MISTER J M HUTCHINGS HAVING HEARD OF ITS WONDERFUL SCENERY COLLECTED A PARTY AND MADE THE FIRST REGULAR TOURIST'S VISIT TO THE YOSEMITE
FOOD THERE IS NONE IN THE MORNING IT'S BREAD AT DINNER GRUEL AND IN THE EVENING BREAD AGAIN AS FOR TEA OR SOUR CABBAGE SOUP THE MASTER AND THE MISTRESS THEMSELVES GUZZLE THAT
ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY AFTER STARTING OUT
HOME TO OUR VILLAGE I CAN'T BEAR THIS ANY MORE I BOW TO THE GROUND TO YOU AND WILL PRAY TO GOD FOR EVER AND EVER TAKE ME FROM HERE OR I SHALL DIE
TO SEE YOUR PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT COME THEY WILL COME IF I FIND THEM YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY OF MY PEOPLE THERE SAID TENAYA I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE MY TRIBE IS SMALL
MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF MY TRIBE HAVE COME FROM OTHER TRIBES AND IF THEY GO TO THE PLAINS AND ARE SEEN THEY WILL BE KILLED BY THE FRIENDS OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY HAVE QUARRELED I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS GROWING OLD AND IT WAS WELL THAT I SHOULD GO
MOST OF IT HAD BEEN EXPLORED IN A GENERAL WAY AND SOME OF ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURES HAD BEEN NAMED BUT THE INDIANS HAD FLED UP THE TENAYA CANYON TRAIL AND NONE OF THEM WERE SEEN EXCEPT AN OLD WOMAN UNABLE TO FOLLOW THE FUGITIVES
SHORT TAILED DEVIL WHEN THE TREE WAS DOWN HIS GRANDFATHER DRAGGED IT TO THE MASTER'S HOUSE AND THERE THEY SET ABOUT DECORATING IT THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA VANKA'S GREAT FRIEND
ALL FOR SALE AND FOR EVERY KIND OF FISH AWFULLY CONVENIENT AND THERE WAS ONE HOOK WHICH WOULD CATCH A SHEAT FISH WEIGHING A POUND AND THERE ARE SHOPS WITH GUNS LIKE THE MASTER'S AND I AM SURE THEY MUST COST ONE HUNDRED RUBLES EACH
OUR EFFORTS TO BE FUNNY IN THE SAKI MANNER HAVE NOT SURVIVED TO PROVE IT WHAT IS SAKI'S MANNER
AND CHILDREN THEIR OWN PARENTS IN A WORD ALL REVERENCE SHALL THEN BE BANISHED NO TRUE RESPECT TO OTHER SHALL BE HAD THEY'LL SAY THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS TURN BOTH IN HIS GOING FORTH AND HIS RETURN
HE ASKS HOLDING OUT HIS SNUFF BOX TO THE WOMEN THE WOMEN TAKE A PINCH OF SNUFF AND SNEEZE THE OLD MAN GOES INTO INDESCRIBABLE ECSTASIES BREAKS INTO LOUD LAUGHTER AND CRIES
HIS CUDGEL WILL BE HANGING FROM HIS BELT HE WILL BE HUGGING HIMSELF WITH COLD GIVING A LITTLE DRY OLD MAN'S COUGH AND AT TIMES PINCHING A SERVANT GIRL OR A COOK WON'T WE TAKE SOME SNUFF
INSTRUCTING THEM TO TELL THE INDIANS THAT IF THEY WOULD COME IN AND MAKE TREATY WITH THE COMMISSIONERS THEY WOULD BE FURNISHED WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING AND BE PROTECTED BUT IF THEY DID NOT COME IN HE WOULD MAKE WAR UPON THEM AND KILL THEM ALL
MYSELF BUT LATELY DOWN FROM SAINT JAMES I WAS NOT TOO PROUD TO TAKE SOME SLIGHT BUT PITYING INTEREST IN MEN OF OTHER COLLEGES THE UNUSUAL NAME OF A FRESHMAN UP AT WESTMINSTER ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION
SHALL CEASE TO DART UPON IT ANY LIGHT MORE THAN IN AN ECLIPSE OR IN THE NIGHT SO THAT AT ONCE ITS FAVOUR SHALL BE GONE AND LIBERTY WITH IT BE LEFT ALONE AND YET BEFORE IT COME TO RUIN THUS
AND YET BEFORE THAT THEY BE CLEAN DISPERST
THAT IT LOOKS AS IF IT HAD BEEN POLISHED AND RUBBED OVER WITH SNOW FOR THE HOLIDAYS VANKA SIGHS DIPS HIS PEN IN THE INK AND CONTINUES TO WRITE LAST NIGHT I GOT A THRASHING
AND SAID HIS PEOPLE WERE ON THE WAY TO OUR CAMP TO GO WITH THE MEN SENT BY THE GREAT FATHER WHO WAS SO GOOD AND RICH ANOTHER DAY PASSED BUT NO INDIANS FROM THE DEEP VALLEY APPEARED
AND TO THE SOUND OF BELLS VANKA RAN TO THE FIRST POST BOX AND SLIPPED HIS PRECIOUS LETTER INTO THE SLIT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LULLED BY HOPE HE WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY
MY LIFE IS A MISFORTUNE WORSE THAN ANY DOG'S I SEND GREETINGS TO ALIONA TO ONE EYED TEGOR AND THE COACHMAN AND DON'T LET ANY ONE HAVE MY MOUTH ORGAN I REMAIN YOUR GRANDSON
BY KEEPING IT IN GAOL WHENCE IT SHALL HAVE NO HELP BUT HIM WHO BEING TO IT GAVE AND TO INCREASE HIS MOURNFUL ACCIDENT
AND MISSUS PACKLETIDE'S TIGER SEEM TO ME TO BE THE MASTERPIECES OF THIS BOOK IN BOTH OF THEM CLOVIS EXERCISES NEEDLESSLY HIS TITULAR RIGHT OF ENTRY BUT HE CAN BE REMOVED WITHOUT DAMAGE
HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS GRANDFATHER ALWAYS WENT TO THE FOREST FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND TOOK HIS GRANDSON WITH HIM WHAT HAPPY TIMES THE FROST CRACKLED HIS GRANDFATHER CRACKLED AND AS THEY BOTH DID
MORE THAN ONCE THEY HAD NEARLY BROKEN HIS HIND LEGS TWICE HE HAD BEEN HUNG UP EVERY WEEK HE WAS NEARLY FLOGGED TO DEATH BUT HE ALWAYS RECOVERED AT THIS MOMENT FOR CERTAIN
WHO TRUSTING TOO MUCH IN THEIR HOPEFUL TIME LIVE BUT A WHILE AND PERISH IN THEIR PRIME NEITHER SHALL ANY WHO THIS COURSE SHALL RUN LEAVE OFF THE RACE WHICH HE HATH ONCE BEGUN
LOCATE IS THE PLEASANT WORD HERE STILL MORE SATISFYING IN THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO WAS TATTOOED FROM COLLAR BONE TO WAIST LINE WITH A GLOWING REPRESENTATION OF THE FALL OF ICARUS
IS GUARDED JEALOUSLY FROM ALL BUT A FEW INTIMATES THE SECRET TO TAKE A CONTRARY CASE OF OUR INFALLIBLE REMEDY FOR SEASICKNESS IS THRUST UPON EVERY TRAVELLER WE MEET
AND I AM FRIGHTFULLY HUNGRY AND SO SAD THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU I CRY ALL THE TIME THE OTHER DAY THE MASTER HIT ME ON THE HEAD WITH A LAST I FELL TO THE GROUND AND ONLY JUST RETURNED TO LIFE
SHOWED THAT THEY HAD BEEN HURRIEDLY ABANDONED THAT VERY DAY LATER FIVE YOUNG INDIANS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT TO WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EXPEDITION WERE CAPTURED AT THE FOOT OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER A LIVELY CHASE
TO US MANY OTHERS WHO WERE TRYING TO DO IT TOO FOR WE WERE SO DOMESTIC HE SO TERRIFYINGLY COSMOPOLITAN WHILE WE WERE BEING FUNNY AS PLANNED WITH COLLAR STUDS AND HOT WATER BOTTLES
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE TO LET ME CLEAN THE BOOTS OR I'LL GO INSTEAD OF FEDYA AS UNDERHERDSMAN DEAR GRANDPAPA I CAN'T BEAR THIS ANY MORE IT'LL KILL ME I WANTED TO RUN AWAY TO OUR VILLAGE
NOT A BREATH OF WIND CLEAR AND FROSTY
MY YOUNG MEN HAVE SOMETIMES TAKEN HORSES AND MULES FROM THE WHITES
LIKE EVERY ARTIST WORTH CONSIDERATION HE HAD NO RECIPE IF HIS EXOTIC CHOICE OF SUBJECT WAS OFTEN HIS STRENGTH IT WAS OFTEN HIS WEAKNESS
THEY STOLE A NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES FROM THEIR ENTERTAINERS AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
INARIME DID NOT MORE QUICKLY MOVE WHEN TYPHEUS DID THE VAST HUGE HILLS REMOVE AND FOR DESPITE INTO THE SEA THEM THREW THUS SHALL IT THEN BE LOST BY WAYS NOT FEW
BUT THAT YOUNG AND STRONG MEN CAN FIND PLENTY IN THE MOUNTAINS THEREFORE WHY SHOULD THEY GO TO THE HOT PLAINS TO BE PENNED UP LIKE HORSES AND CATTLE MY HEART HAS BEEN SORE SINCE THAT TALK
THROUGH AN INTERPRETER EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY LATER
POOR MORTALS WHO WAIT FOR A HAPPY DAY CHEER UP YOUR HEARTS
BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND WHEN I AM DEAD I WILL CALL MY PEOPLE TO COME AND THEY SHALL HEAR ME IN THEIR SLEEP AND COME TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR CHIEF AND HIS SON YES SIR AMERICA MY SPIRIT WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
TAUGHT HIM TO READ WRITE COUNT UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND EVEN TO DANCE THE QUADRILLE WHEN PELAGUEYA DIED THEY PLACED THE ORPHAN VANKA IN THE KITCHEN WITH HIS GRANDFATHER AND FROM THE KITCHEN HE WAS SENT TO MOSCOW
DESCRIBED IT IN ARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY A GOOD ARTIST WHO WAS TAKEN INTO THE VALLEY BY HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
THE CHILDREN DON'T COME ROUND AT CHRISTMAS WITH A STAR NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO SING IN THE CHOIR
THAT NEVER WERE IN HISTORY SUCH COILS SET DOWN AS YET SUCH TUMULTS AND GARBOILS
IF HIS INSENSITIVENESS CARRIED HIM THROUGH AT TIMES TO VICTORY IT BROUGHT HIM AT TIMES TO DEFEAT I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS THAT MASTERY OF THE CONTE IN THIS BOOK AT LEAST
IT IS USELESS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHO DESTROYED YOUR PROPERTY AND KILLED YOUR PEOPLE I AM OLD AND YOU CAN KILL ME IF YOU WILL BUT IT IS USELESS TO LIE TO YOU WHO KNOW MORE THAN ALL THE INDIANS
TO THE BORDER OF THE PARK EIGHT MILES BELOW THE VALLEY IT IS EIGHTY MILES LONG
BUT WAS CAUGHT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SWIM ACROSS THE RIVER
THE YOSEMITE OR GRIZZLY BEAR TRIBE FANCYING THEMSELVES SECURE IN THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD WERE THE MOST TROUBLESOME AND DEFIANT OF ALL AND IT WAS WHILE THE MARIPOSA BATTALION UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR SAVAGE
BUT HE WAS MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE WORK WHICH WAS ACCLAIMED BY ALL WHO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING IT AS PINCINI'S MASTERPIECE THIS STORY THE BACKGROUND
LATER ONE HEARD THAT THIS UNDERGRADUATE FROM OVERSEAS HAD GONE UP AT AN AGE MORE ADVANCED THAN CUSTOMARY
BUT I AM NOW WILLING TO GO FOR IT IS BEST FOR MY PEOPLE PUSHING AHEAD TAKING TURNS IN BREAKING A WAY THROUGH THE SNOW THEY ARRIVED IN SIGHT OF THE GREAT VALLEY EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
THE CORNERS OF VANKA'S MOUTH WENT DOWN HE RUBBED HIS EYES WITH HIS DIRTY FIST AND SOBBED I'LL GRATE YOUR TOBACCO FOR YOU HE CONTINUED I'LL PRAY TO GOD FOR YOU
THE LIEUTENANT BEING FULLY SATISFIED THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE REAL MURDERERS PROMPTLY PRONOUNCED JUDGMENT AND HAD THEM PLACED IN LINE AND SHOT LIEUTENANT MOORE PURSUED THE FUGITIVES TO MONO BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING ANY OF THEM
WITHOUT BEING DISTRACTED OR DIVERTED BY HIS CARNAL AFFECTIONS AND DEPRAVED NATURE THE MONK THEN SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK IN YOUR CONSCIENCE IS MEANT AND SIGNIFIED BY THIS RIDDLE WHAT
TOO MUCH DOES IT BECOME MONOLOGUE JUDICIOUSLY FED ONE CHARACTER GIVING AND THE OTHER TAKING BUT IN COMMENT IN REFERENCE IN DESCRIPTION IN EVERY DEVELOPMENT OF HIS STORY
ARE PERSECUTED BUT HAPPY IS THAT MAN THAT SHALL NOT BE SCANDALIZED BUT SHALL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO THE END IN AIMING AT THAT MARK WHICH GOD BY HIS DEAR SON HATH SET BEFORE US
INFORMED HIM OF THE WISHES OF THE COMMISSIONERS BUT THE OLD CHIEF WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS OF SAVAGE AND FEARED THAT HE WAS TAKING THIS METHOD OF GETTING THE TRIBE INTO HIS POWER FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVENGING HIS PERSONAL WRONG
THE VERIEST LOUT OF ALL SHALL BE THEIR JUDGE O HORRIBLE AND DANGEROUS DELUGE DELUGE I CALL IT AND THAT FOR GOOD REASON FOR THIS SHALL BE OMITTED IN NO SEASON
THAT SAME DAY THE OLD CHIEF WAS CAPTURED ON THE CLIFF ON THE EAST SIDE OF INDIAN CANYON BY SOME OF BOLING'S SCOUTS AS TENAYA WALKED TOWARD THE CAMP HIS EYE FELL UPON THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FAVORITE SON CAPTAIN BOLING
WHEN THE CAPTIVES WERE ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF THE TWO WHITE MEN THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD KILLED THEM TO PREVENT WHITE MEN FROM COMING TO THEIR VALLEY DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS WARLIKE TRIBE AND CONDUCT THEM TO THE FRESNO RESERVATION THAT THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN HOME THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED
AFTER WAITING STILL ANOTHER DAY THE EXPEDITION STARTED FOR THE VALLEY WHEN TENAYA WAS QUESTIONED AS TO THE ROUTE AND DISTANCE HE SAID THAT THE SNOW WAS SO DEEP THAT THE HORSES COULD NOT GO THROUGH IT
AND GUIDED BY ONE OF TENAYA'S INDIANS DESCENDED BY THE SAME ROUTE AS THAT FOLLOWED BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL AND THE WEARY PARTY WENT INTO CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK OPPOSITE EL CAPITAN AFTER SUPPER SEATED AROUND A BIG FIRE
IN DARK AND OBSCURE TERMS THE SUBORNERS OF MEN ARE THE MAKERS OF MATCHES WHICH ARE COMMONLY FRIENDS AFTER THE TWO CHASES ARE MADE HE THAT WAS IN THE UPPER END OF THE TENNIS COURT GOETH OUT
THE GLOBE TERRESTRIAL IS THE TENNIS BALL AFTER PLAYING WHEN THE GAME IS DONE THEY REFRESH THEMSELVES BEFORE A CLEAR FIRE AND CHANGE THEIR SHIRTS AND VERY WILLINGLY THEY MAKE ALL GOOD CHEER
TAKE A GOLDEN WALNUT AND HIDE IT IN MY GREEN BOX ASK THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA FOR IT SAY IT'S FOR VANKA VANKA SIGHED CONVULSIVELY AND AGAIN STARED AT THE WINDOW
ALWAYS SMILING AND BLEAR EYED ALL DAY HE SLEPT IN THE SERVANTS KITCHEN OR TRIFLED WITH THE COOKS
I UNFORTUNATELY FELL ASLEEP AND DURING THE WEEK MY MISTRESS TOLD ME TO CLEAN A HERRING
LET US TAKE A SAMPLE OR TWO OF SAKI NINETEEN ELEVEN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE DINNER HAD WORN OFF THE WINE LISTS HAD BEEN CONSULTED
AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT BY ACT OF CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY OF THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN O FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE
SO ONE FELT THAT THIS WESTMINSTER FREE LANCE IN THE THIRTIES WAS NO FIT COMPETITOR FOR THE YOUTH OF OTHER COLLEGES INDEED IT COULD NOT COMPETE WELL I DISCOVERED HIM
THE REST APPROVED HIS WORDS AND THEREON MEN SERVANTS POURED WATER OVER THE HANDS OF THE GUESTS WHILE PAGES FILLED THE MIXING BOWLS WITH WINE AND WATER AND HANDED IT ROUND AFTER GIVING EVERY MAN HIS DRINK OFFERING
IF SOME GOD WERE BUT TO BRING ULYSSES BACK YOU SHOULD SEE WITH WHAT MIGHT AND MAIN I WOULD FIGHT FOR HIM IN LIKE WORDS EUMAEUS PRAYED TO ALL THE GODS THAT ULYSSES MIGHT RETURN WHEN THEREFORE
WHO KILLS EVERY ONE THAT COMES NEAR HIM YOU WILL NEVER GET AWAY ALIVE SO DRINK AND KEEP QUIET WITHOUT GETTING INTO A QUARREL WITH MEN YOUNGER THAN YOURSELF PENELOPE THEN SPOKE TO HIM
FOR THEY FEARED HE MIGHT STRING THE BOW ANTINOUS THEREFORE REBUKED HIM FIERCELY SAYING WRETCHED CREATURE YOU HAVE NOT SO MUCH AS A GRAIN OF SENSE IN YOUR WHOLE BODY YOU OUGHT TO THINK YOURSELF LUCKY
THERE IS NOT A MAN OF US ALL WHO IS SUCH ANOTHER AS ULYSSES FOR I HAVE SEEN HIM AND REMEMBER HIM THOUGH I WAS THEN ONLY A CHILD
THAT WAS OWING FROM THE WHOLE PEOPLE FOR THE MESSENIANS HAD CARRIED OFF THREE HUNDRED SHEEP FROM ITHACA AND HAD SAILED AWAY WITH THEM AND WITH THEIR SHEPHERDS IN QUEST OF THESE ULYSSES TOOK A LONG JOURNEY WHILE STILL QUITE YOUNG
WHO WAS WARMING IT BY THE FIRE BUT EVEN SO HE COULD NOT STRING IT AND HE WAS GREATLY GRIEVED HE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH AND SAID
AND PUT IT OUT OF DOORS THEN WHEN THEY HAD MADE THE WHOLE PLACE QUITE CLEAN AND ORDERLY
I SHALL EITHER BE ALWAYS FEEBLE AND OF NO PROWESS OR I AM TOO YOUNG AND HAVE NOT YET REACHED MY FULL STRENGTH SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HOLD MY OWN IF ANY ONE ATTACKS ME YOU OTHERS THEREFORE WHO ARE STRONGER THAN I
AND WHEN HER TEARS HAD RELIEVED HER SHE WENT TO THE CLOISTER WHERE THE SUITORS WERE CARRYING THE BOW AND THE QUIVER WITH THE MANY DEADLY ARROWS THAT WERE INSIDE IT ALONG WITH HER CAME HER MAIDENS
SO THEY MADE ME TELEMACHUS HEARD HIM
LET US THEN SHOW FIGHT
STRUNG IT AS EASILY AS A SKILLED BARD STRINGS A NEW PEG OF HIS LYRE AND MAKES THE TWISTED GUT FAST AT BOTH ENDS THEN HE TOOK IT IN HIS RIGHT HAND TO PROVE THE STRING AND IT SANG SWEETLY UNDER HIS TOUCH
THAT HE IS OF NOBLE BIRTH GIVE HIM THE BOW AND LET US SEE WHETHER HE CAN STRING IT OR NO I SAY AND IT SHALL SURELY BE THAT IF APOLLO
SO THAT HE FELL HEAVILY TO THE GROUND AND STRUCK THE EARTH WITH HIS FOREHEAD THEN TELEMACHUS SPRANG AWAY FROM HIM LEAVING HIS SPEAR STILL IN THE BODY FOR HE FEARED THAT IF HE STAYED TO DRAW IT OUT
AND ARMED HIMSELF FIRST WHILE THE STOCKMAN AND THE SWINEHERD ALSO PUT ON THEIR ARMOUR AND TOOK THEIR PLACES NEAR ULYSSES MEANWHILE ULYSSES AS LONG AS HIS ARROWS LASTED HAD BEEN SHOOTING THE SUITORS ONE BY ONE
BUT HE BROUGHT IT UPON HIMSELF THROUGH HIS OWN DRUNKENNESS IN LIKE MANNER I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WILL GO HARDLY WITH YOU IF YOU STRING THE BOW YOU WILL FIND NO MERCY FROM ANY ONE HERE
TO MAKE THE SUITORS TRY THEIR SKILL WITH THE BOW AND WITH THE IRON AXES IN CONTEST AMONG THEMSELVES AS A MEANS OF BRINGING ABOUT THEIR DESTRUCTION SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND GOT THE STORE ROOM KEY WHICH WAS MADE OF BRONZE AND HAD A HANDLE OF IVORY
ALONG WITH FRAGRANT HERBS REACHING THENCE SHE TOOK DOWN THE BOW WITH ITS BOW CASE FROM THE PEG ON WHICH IT HUNG SHE SAT DOWN WITH IT ON HER KNEES WEEPING BITTERLY AS SHE TOOK THE BOW OUT OF ITS CASE
DO NOT THEREFORE BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO CUT MY HEAD OFF YOUR OWN SON TELEMACHUS WILL TELL YOU THAT I DID NOT WANT TO FREQUENT YOUR HOUSE AND SING TO THE SUITORS AFTER THEIR MEALS BUT THEY WERE TOO MANY AND TOO STRONG FOR ME
THEY BENT HIS HANDS AND FEET WELL BEHIND HIS BACK
I THINK I WILL SAY IT WHAT MANNER OF MEN WOULD YOU BE TO STAND BY ULYSSES IF SOME GOD SHOULD BRING HIM BACK HERE ALL OF A SUDDEN SAY WHICH YOU ARE DISPOSED TO DO TO SIDE WITH THE SUITORS
TO TELL THE WOMEN AND MAKE THEM COME TO ULYSSES IN THE MEANTIME HE CALLED TELEMACHUS THE STOCKMAN AND THE SWINEHERD BEGIN SAID HE TO REMOVE THE DEAD AND MAKE THE WOMEN HELP YOU THEN
SOME ONE OF US IS EVEN NOW HOPING AND PRAYING THAT HE MAY MARRY PENELOPE BUT WHEN HE HAS SEEN THIS BOW AND TRIED IT LET HIM WOO AND MAKE BRIDAL OFFERINGS TO SOME OTHER WOMAN AND LET PENELOPE
HOLD HE CRIED THE MAN IS GUILTLESS DO HIM NO HURT AND WE WILL SPARE MEDON TOO WHO WAS ALWAYS GOOD TO ME WHEN I WAS A BOY UNLESS
KILLED IPHITUS ERE THEY COULD DO SO THIS BOW THEN
TILL THEY ARE QUITE DEAD AND HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT LOVE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY USED TO LIE IN SECRET WITH THE SUITORS ON THIS THE WOMEN CAME DOWN IN A BODY WEEPING AND WAILING BITTERLY FIRST
OR WITH ULYSSES FATHER JOVE ANSWERED THE STOCKMAN WOULD INDEED
THEY SHOWED NO DISRESPECT TO TELEMACHUS FOR HE HAS ONLY LATELY GROWN AND HIS MOTHER NEVER PERMITTED HIM TO GIVE ORDERS TO THE FEMALE SERVANTS BUT LET ME GO UPSTAIRS AND TELL YOUR WIFE ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED
BUT HE FOUND THEM ALL LYING IN THE DUST AND WELTERING IN THEIR BLOOD THEY WERE LIKE FISHES WHICH FISHERMEN HAVE NETTED OUT OF THE SEA AND THROWN UPON THE BEACH TO LIE GASPING FOR WATER
AS HE HAD BIDDEN HER AND ULYSSES THOROUGHLY PURIFIED THE CLOISTERS AND BOTH THE INNER AND OUTER COURTS THEN SHE WENT INSIDE TO CALL THE WOMEN AND TELL THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEREON THEY CAME FROM THEIR APARTMENT
FOLLOWING TELEMACHUS SHE FOUND ULYSSES AMONG THE CORPSES BESPATTERED WITH BLOOD AND FILTH LIKE A LION THAT HAS JUST BEEN DEVOURING AN OX AND HIS BREAST AND BOTH HIS CHEEKS ARE ALL BLOODY
IF THEY HEAR ANY GROANING OR UPROAR AS OF MEN FIGHTING ABOUT THE HOUSE THEY MUST NOT COME OUT THEY MUST KEEP QUIET AND STAY WHERE THEY ARE AT THEIR WORK AND I CHARGE YOU
AND SEND HIS ARROW THROUGH EACH ONE OF TWELVE AXES HIM WILL I FOLLOW AND QUIT THIS HOUSE OF MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SO GOODLY AND SO ABOUNDING IN WEALTH BUT EVEN SO I DOUBT NOT THAT I SHALL REMEMBER IT IN MY DREAMS
THEN THEY DRAGGED HIM THROUGH THE DOORWAY OUT OF THE HOUSE SO HE WENT AWAY CRAZED AND BORE THE BURDEN OF HIS CRIME BEREFT OF UNDERSTANDING HENCEFORTH THEREFORE THERE WAS WAR BETWEEN MANKIND AND THE CENTAURS
FROM HIS ARROWS LET US HAVE AT HIM WITH A RUSH TO DRIVE HIM FROM THE PAVEMENT AND DOORWAY WE CAN THEN GET THROUGH INTO THE TOWN AND RAISE SUCH AN ALARM AS SHALL SOON STAY HIS SHOOTING
WHEN HE HAD TAKEN AIM HE LET FLY AND HIS ARROW PIERCED EVERY ONE OF THE HANDLE HOLES OF THE AXES FROM THE FIRST ONWARDS TILL IT HAD GONE RIGHT THROUGH THEM AND INTO THE OUTER COURTYARD THEN HE SAID TO TELEMACHUS
OR EUMAEUS HAS ALREADY KILLED HIM OR HE HAS FALLEN IN YOUR WAY WHEN YOU WERE RAGING ABOUT THE COURT MEDON CAUGHT THESE WORDS OF TELEMACHUS FOR HE WAS CROUCHING UNDER A SEAT
FOR HIS FATHER AND THE OTHER CHIEFTAINS SENT HIM ON A MISSION TO RECOVER THEM
AND THE DART WENT CLEAN THROUGH HIM SO THAT HE FELL FORWARD FULL ON HIS FACE UPON THE GROUND THEN MINERVA FROM HER SEAT ON THE RAFTER
YET I AM LAUGHING AND ENJOYING MYSELF AS THOUGH THERE WERE NOTHING HAPPENING BUT SUITORS AS THE CONTEST HAS BEEN AGREED UPON LET IT GO FORWARD IT IS FOR A WOMAN WHOSE PEER IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN PYLOS
FOR THE FOOT WHICH YOU GAVE ULYSSES WHEN HE WAS BEGGING ABOUT IN HIS OWN HOUSE THUS SPOKE THE STOCKMAN AND ULYSSES STRUCK THE SON OF DAMASTOR WITH A SPEAR IN CLOSE FIGHT
ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK SO THAT HIS HEAD FELL ROLLING IN THE DUST WHILE HE WAS YET SPEAKING
I SHALL DIE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT AND SHALL HAVE GOT NO THANKS FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT I DID ULYSSES LOOKED STERNLY AT HIM AND ANSWERED IF YOU WERE THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST YOU MUST HAVE PRAYED MANY A TIME
BEARING A CHEST THAT CONTAINED MUCH IRON AND BRONZE WHICH HER HUSBAND HAD WON AS PRIZES WHEN SHE REACHED THE SUITORS SHE STOOD BY ONE OF THE BEARING POSTS SUPPORTING THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER
NOT IF I CAN WIN THE PRIZES WHICH MY FATHER WON BEFORE ME AS HE SPOKE HE SPRANG FROM HIS SEAT THREW HIS CRIMSON CLOAK FROM HIM
AND DISHONOURING HIS HOUSE MUST NOT EXPECT OTHERS TO THINK WELL OF THEM WHY THEN SHOULD YOU MIND IF MEN TALK AS YOU THINK THEY WILL THIS STRANGER IS STRONG AND WELL BUILT HE SAYS MOREOVER
LIKE THE TWITTERING OF A SWALLOW THE SUITORS WERE DISMAYED AND TURNED COLOUR AS THEY HEARD IT AT THAT MOMENT MOREOVER JOVE THUNDERED LOUDLY AS A SIGN AND THE HEART OF ULYSSES REJOICED AS HE HEARD THE OMEN
FROM WHAT THEY HAD IN THE HOUSE AND THE SUITORS WARMED THE BOW AND AGAIN MADE TRIAL OF IT BUT THEY WERE NONE OF THEM NEARLY STRONG ENOUGH TO STRING IT NEVERTHELESS
THAT YOU ARE SO LAMENTABLY LESS VALIANT NOW THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN GROUND FACE TO FACE WITH THE SUITORS IN YOUR OWN HOUSE COME ON MY GOOD FELLOW STAND BY MY SIDE AND SEE HOW MENTOR
THE WINE MUST HAVE BEEN DOING YOU A MISCHIEF
AND WAS TURNING IT EVERY WAY ABOUT AND PROVING IT ALL OVER TO SEE WHETHER THE WORMS HAD BEEN EATING INTO ITS TWO HORNS DURING HIS ABSENCE THEN WOULD ONE TURN TOWARDS HIS NEIGHBOUR SAYING
BUT KILLED HIM IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING AND KEPT THE MARES HIMSELF IT WAS WHEN CLAIMING THESE
WHO WAS THE HEAD AND FRONT OF THE OFFENDING LIES LOW ALREADY IT WAS ALL HIS DOING IT WAS NOT THAT HE WANTED TO MARRY PENELOPE HE DID NOT SO MUCH CARE ABOUT THAT WHAT HE WANTED WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT AND JOVE
FOR SOME GOD HAS BEEN SENDING HER TO SLEEP DO NOT WAKE HER YET ANSWERED ULYSSES BUT TELL THE WOMEN WHO HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES TO COME TO ME
TILL THE HEAT OF THE SUN MAKES AN END OF THEM EVEN SO WERE THE SUITORS LYING ALL HUDDLED UP ONE AGAINST THE OTHER THEN ULYSSES SAID TO TELEMACHUS
BUT MINERVA MADE THEM ALL OF NO EFFECT ONE HIT THE DOOR POST ANOTHER WENT AGAINST THE DOOR THE POINTED SHAFT OF ANOTHER STRUCK THE WALL AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD AVOIDED ALL THE SPEARS OF THE SUITORS
CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD TAKE ME HOME WITH HIM
THEN TELEMACHUS SPOKE GREAT HEAVENS HE EXCLAIMED JOVE MUST HAVE ROBBED ME OF MY SENSES HERE IS MY DEAR AND EXCELLENT MOTHER SAYING SHE WILL QUIT THIS HOUSE AND MARRY AGAIN
OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE STILL FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES THEY WERE BY FAR THE MOST VALIANT FOR THE OTHERS HAD ALREADY FALLEN UNDER THE ARROWS OF ULYSSES
EITHER IN WORD OR DEED AND I TRIED TO STOP THE OTHERS I SAW THEM BUT THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN AND NOW THEY ARE PAYING FOR THEIR FOLLY I WAS THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST IF YOU KILL ME
WHILE THE POINTED SHAFT OF ANOTHER STRUCK THE WALL STILL AMPHIMEDON JUST TOOK A PIECE OF THE TOP SKIN FROM OFF TELEMACHUS'S WRIST
I GRIEVE THAT I SHALL HAVE TO FORGO THE MARRIAGE BUT I DO NOT CARE NEARLY SO MUCH ABOUT THIS FOR THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WOMEN IN ITHACA AND ELSEWHERE WHAT I FEEL MOST IS THE FACT OF OUR BEING SO INFERIOR TO ULYSSES IN STRENGTH
THAT WE CANNOT STRING HIS BOW THIS WILL DISGRACE US IN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO ARE YET UNBORN IT SHALL NOT BE SO EURYMACHUS SAID ANTINOUS AND YOU KNOW IT YOURSELF
HE SAW FOR CERTAIN WHAT MIND THEY WERE OF ULYSSES SAID IT IS I ULYSSES WHO AM HERE I HAVE SUFFERED MUCH BUT AT LAST IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR I AM COME BACK TO MY OWN COUNTRY
THOUGH HE HAD HOPED TO STRING THE BOW AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON HE WAS TRYING FOR THE FOURTH TIME AND WOULD HAVE STRUNG IT HAD NOT ULYSSES MADE A SIGN TO CHECK HIM IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EAGERNESS SO HE SAID ALAS
THOUGH YOU SHOULD GIVE ME ALL THAT YOU HAVE IN THE WORLD BOTH NOW AND ALL THAT YOU EVER SHALL HAVE I WILL NOT STAY MY HAND TILL I HAVE PAID ALL OF YOU IN FULL YOU MUST FIGHT OR FLY FOR YOUR LIVES AND FLY
IT IS TIME FOR THE ACHAEANS TO PREPARE SUPPER WHILE THERE IS STILL DAYLIGHT AND THEN OTHERWISE TO DISPORT THEMSELVES WITH SONG AND DANCE WHICH ARE THE CROWNING ORNAMENTS OF A BANQUET
AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HIS RAGS ASIDE FROM THE GREAT SCAR AND WHEN THEY HAD EXAMINED IT THOROUGHLY THEY BOTH OF THEM WEPT ABOUT ULYSSES THREW THEIR ARMS ROUND HIM AND KISSED HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS
LET ANOTHER HAVE IT THIS BOW SHALL TAKE THE LIFE AND SOUL OUT OF MANY A CHIEF AMONG US FOR IT IS BETTER TO DIE THAN TO LIVE AFTER HAVING MISSED THE PRIZE THAT WE HAVE SO LONG STRIVEN FOR AND WHICH HAS BROUGHT US SO LONG TOGETHER
WE WILL NOT LET YOUR SONS LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE NOR YOUR DAUGHTERS NOR SHALL YOUR WIDOW
THAT ARE OVER AGAINST ELIS WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO LET ANY ONE HAVE THE BOW OR TO REFUSE IT NO ONE SHALL FORCE ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER NOT EVEN THOUGH I CHOOSE TO MAKE THE STRANGER A PRESENT OF THE BOW OUTRIGHT AND LET HIM TAKE IT AWAY WITH HIM
THEY CARRIED THE DEAD BODIES OUT AND PROPPED THEM UP AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN THE GATEHOUSE ULYSSES ORDERED THEM ABOUT AND MADE THEM DO THEIR WORK QUICKLY SO THEY HAD TO CARRY THE BODIES OUT
GET SPONGES AND CLEAN WATER TO SWILL DOWN THE TABLES AND SEATS WHEN YOU HAVE THOROUGHLY CLEANSED THE WHOLE CLOISTERS TAKE THE WOMEN INTO THE SPACE BETWEEN THE DOMED ROOM AND THE WALL OF THE OUTER COURT AND RUN THEM THROUGH WITH YOUR SWORDS
O SWINEHERD EUMAEUS SAYING MELANTHIUS YOU WILL PASS THE NIGHT ON A SOFT BED AS YOU DESERVE
AND ALSO ALL THE MAIDSERVANTS THAT ARE IN THE HOUSE ALL THAT YOU HAVE SAID IS TRUE
HIS TABLE THE CUP AND ALL THE MEATS WENT OVER ON TO THE GROUND AS HE SMOTE THE EARTH WITH HIS FOREHEAD IN THE AGONIES OF DEATH AND HE KICKED THE STOOL WITH HIS FEET UNTIL HIS EYES WERE CLOSED IN DARKNESS
GO THEN WITHIN THE HOUSE AND BUSY YOURSELF WITH YOUR DAILY DUTIES YOUR LOOM YOUR DISTAFF AND THE ORDERING OF YOUR SERVANTS THIS BOW IS A MAN'S MATTER AND MINE ABOVE ALL OTHERS FOR IT IS I WHO AM MASTER HERE
IN BEING ALLOWED TO DINE UNHARMED AMONG YOUR BETTERS WITHOUT HAVING ANY SMALLER PORTION SERVED YOU THAN WE OTHERS HAVE HAD AND IN BEING ALLOWED TO HEAR OUR CONVERSATION
SON OF DAMASTOR EURYNOMUS AMPHIMEDON DEMOPTOLEMUS PISANDER AND POLYBUS SON OF POLYCTOR BORE THE BRUNT OF THE FIGHT UPON THE SUITORS SIDE
IF YOU ARE ULYSSES SAID HE THEN WHAT YOU HAVE SAID IS JUST WE HAVE DONE MUCH WRONG ON YOUR LANDS AND IN YOUR HOUSE
AND TELL THOSE WHO ARE WITHIN WHEN YOU GO IN DO SO SEPARATELY NOT BOTH TOGETHER I WILL GO FIRST AND DO YOU FOLLOW AFTERWARDS LET THIS MOREOVER BE THE TOKEN BETWEEN US THE SUITORS
THAN THAT YOU WANT TO MARRY ME THIS THEN BEING THE PRIZE THAT YOU ARE CONTENDING FOR I WILL BRING OUT THE MIGHTY BOW OF ULYSSES AND WHOMSOEVER OF YOU SHALL STRING IT MOST EASILY
HELP WOULD COME AT ONCE AND WE SHOULD SOON MAKE AN END OF THIS MAN AND HIS SHOOTING THIS MAY NOT BE AGELAUS ANSWERED MELANTHIUS THE MOUTH OF THE NARROW PASSAGE IS DANGEROUSLY NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO THE OUTER COURT
THEY WASHED THEIR HANDS AND FEET AND WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE FOR ALL WAS NOW OVER
TELEMACHUS DID AS HIS FATHER SAID AND WENT OFF TO THE STORE ROOM WHERE THE ARMOUR WAS KEPT HE CHOSE FOUR SHIELDS EIGHT SPEARS AND FOUR BRASS HELMETS WITH HORSE HAIR PLUMES HE BROUGHT THEM WITH ALL SPEED TO HIS FATHER
SO HE PUT THE BOW DOWN THEN AND THERE BUT TELEMACHUS SHOUTED OUT AT HIM FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CLOISTERS AND THREATENED HIM SAYING FATHER EUMAEUS BRING THE BOW ON IN SPITE OF THEM
FOR THE SWINEHERD AND THE STOCKMAN FOR WE HAD BETTER BE ARMED RUN AND FETCH THEM ANSWERED ULYSSES WHILE MY ARROWS HOLD OUT OR WHEN I AM ALONE THEY MAY GET ME AWAY FROM THE DOOR
HE WAS TO BE THE FIRST THAT SHOULD TASTE OF THE ARROWS FROM THE HANDS OF ULYSSES WHOM HE WAS DISHONOURING IN HIS OWN HOUSE
BY AND BY MELANTHIUS CAME OUT WITH A HELMET IN ONE HAND AND AN OLD DRY ROTTED SHIELD IN THE OTHER
AND THEY DID EVEN AS HE HAD SAID THEY WENT TO THE STORE ROOM WHICH THEY ENTERED BEFORE MELANTHIUS SAW THEM FOR HE WAS BUSY SEARCHING FOR ARMS IN THE INNERMOST PART OF THE ROOM SO THE TWO TOOK THEIR STAND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE DOOR AND WAITED
SO EUMAEUS BROUGHT THE BOW ON AND PLACED IT IN THE HANDS OF ULYSSES WHEN HE HAD DONE THIS HE CALLED EURYCLEA APART AND SAID TO HER
AT THIS MOMENT THE BOW
THAT HE HAS DONE IN YOUR HOUSE ULYSSES ANSWERED TELEMACHUS AND I WILL HOLD THESE SUITORS IN CHECK NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO
BY KILLING US OUTRIGHT THEY THEREFORE AIMED STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM AND THREW THEIR SPEARS ULYSSES KILLED DEMOPTOLEMUS TELEMACHUS EURYADES EUMAEUS ELATUS
EVEN SO DID ULYSSES AND HIS MEN FALL UPON THE SUITORS AND SMITE THEM ON EVERY SIDE THEY MADE A HORRIBLE GROANING AS THEIR BRAINS WERE BEING BATTERED IN AND THE GROUND SEETHED WITH THEIR BLOOD
IN THE NARROW SPACE BETWEEN THE WALL OF THE DOMED ROOM AND THAT OF THE YARD SO THAT THEY COULD NOT GET AWAY AND TELEMACHUS SAID TO THE OTHER TWO I SHALL NOT LET THESE WOMEN DIE A CLEAN DEATH
YOUR GUEST HAS NOT DISGRACED YOU TELEMACHUS I DID NOT MISS WHAT I AIMED AT AND I WAS NOT LONG IN STRINGING MY BOW I AM STILL STRONG AND NOT AS THE SUITORS TWIT ME WITH BEING NOW HOWEVER
OR KNOCK HIM DOWN SO HE SET OFF AT A RUN AND IMMEDIATELY WAS AT HIS FATHER'S SIDE THEN HE SAID FATHER LET ME BRING YOU A SHIELD TWO SPEARS AND A BRASS HELMET FOR YOUR TEMPLES
MAKE TRIAL OF THE BOW AND GET THIS CONTEST SETTLED ON THIS HE PUT THE BOW DOWN LETTING IT LEAN AGAINST THE DOOR THAT LED INTO THE HOUSE WITH THE ARROW STANDING AGAINST THE TOP OF THE BOW
IF HEAVEN SHALL DELIVER THE SUITORS INTO MY HANDS I WILL FIND WIVES FOR BOTH OF YOU WILL GIVE YOU HOUSE AND HOLDING CLOSE TO MY OWN AND YOU SHALL BE TO ME AS THOUGH YOU WERE BROTHERS AND FRIENDS OF TELEMACHUS
BRING ME SULPHUR WHICH CLEANSES ALL POLLUTION AND FETCH FIRE ALSO THAT I MAY BURN IT AND PURIFY THE CLOISTERS GO MOREOVER AND TELL PENELOPE TO COME HERE WITH HER ATTENDANTS
COME ON EACH OF YOU IN HIS TURN
NOT A MAN OF YOU SHALL THEIR HEARTS SANK AS THEY HEARD HIM
BUT THE SWINEHERD SAW HIM AND SAID TO ULYSSES WHO WAS BESIDE HIM ULYSSES
AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HIS KEEN BLADE OF BRONZE SHARPENED ON BOTH SIDES AND WITH A LOUD CRY SPRANG TOWARDS ULYSSES BUT ULYSSES INSTANTLY SHOT AN ARROW INTO HIS BREAST THAT CAUGHT HIM BY THE NIPPLE AND FIXED ITSELF IN HIS LIVER
SO SHE FLEW UP TO ONE OF THE RAFTERS IN THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER AND SAT UPON IT IN THE FORM OF A SWALLOW MEANWHILE
I APPEAL MORE ESPECIALLY TO EURYMACHUS AND TO ANTINOUS WHO HAS JUST SPOKEN WITH SO MUCH REASON CEASE SHOOTING FOR THE PRESENT AND LEAVE THE MATTER TO THE GODS BUT IN THE MORNING
HIM THE GLORY OF STRINGING IT I WILL GIVE HIM A CLOAK AND SHIRT OF GOOD WEAR WITH A JAVELIN TO KEEP OFF DOGS AND ROBBERS AND A SHARP SWORD I WILL ALSO GIVE HIM SANDALS AND WILL SEE HIM SENT SAFELY WHEREVER HE WANTS TO GO
WE WILL KILL YOU TOO YOU SHALL PAY FOR IT WITH YOUR HEAD AND WHEN WE HAVE KILLED YOU WE WILL TAKE ALL YOU HAVE IN DOORS OR OUT AND BRING IT INTO HOTCH POT WITH ULYSSES PROPERTY
WHO WAS ABOUT TO TAKE UP A TWO HANDLED GOLD CUP TO DRINK HIS WINE AND ALREADY HAD IT IN HIS HANDS HE HAD NO THOUGHT OF DEATH WHO AMONGST ALL THE REVELLERS WOULD THINK THAT ONE MAN HOWEVER BRAVE
IF APOLLO AND THE OTHER GODS WILL GRANT OUR PRAYER YOUR OWN BOARHOUNDS SHALL GET YOU INTO SOME QUIET LITTLE PLACE AND WORRY YOU TO DEATH EUMAEUS WAS FRIGHTENED AT THE OUTCRY THEY ALL RAISED
FOR SHE SAW THAT A GREAT DEED HAD BEEN DONE BUT ULYSSES CHECKED HER OLD WOMAN SAID HE REJOICE IN SILENCE RESTRAIN YOURSELF AND DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISE ABOUT IT IT IS AN UNHOLY THING
OR YOUNG AS I AM I WILL PELT YOU WITH STONES BACK TO THE COUNTRY FOR I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO I WISH I WAS AS MUCH STRONGER THAN ALL THE OTHER SUITORS IN THE HOUSE AS I AM THAN YOU
ABOVE HIS SHIELD BUT THE SPEAR WENT ON AND FELL TO THE GROUND THEN ULYSSES AND HIS MEN LET DRIVE INTO THE CROWD OF SUITORS
YOU SHALL SEE NO OTHER CONTEST YOU ARE A DOOMED MAN HE WHOM YOU HAVE SLAIN WAS THE FOREMOST YOUTH IN ITHACA AND THE VULTURES SHALL DEVOUR YOU FOR HAVING KILLED HIM
STAY YOUR HAND THEREFORE AND TELL YOUR FATHER OR HE WILL KILL ME IN HIS RAGE AGAINST THE SUITORS FOR HAVING WASTED HIS SUBSTANCE AND BEEN SO FOOLISHLY DISRESPECTFUL TO YOURSELF ULYSSES SMILED AT HIM AND ANSWERED
THESE SUITORS ARE A FEEBLE FOLK THEY ARE PAYING COURT TO THE WIFE OF A BRAVE MAN WHOSE BOW NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO STRING AND YET A BEGGARLY TRAMP WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE STRUNG IT AT ONCE AND SENT AN ARROW THROUGH THE IRON
YOU COUNTRY LOUTS SAID HE SILLY SIMPLETONS WHY SHOULD YOU ADD TO THE SORROWS OF YOUR MISTRESS BY CRYING IN THIS WAY SHE HAS ENOUGH TO GRIEVE HER IN THE LOSS OF HER HUSBAND SIT STILL THEREFORE
I WILL NOW GIVE YOU CONVINCING PROOFS THAT YOU MAY KNOW ME AND BE ASSURED SEE HERE IS THE SCAR FROM THE BOAR'S TOOTH THAT RIPPED ME WHEN I WAS OUT HUNTING ON MT PARNASSUS
WHILE ULYSSES KISSED THEIR HANDS AND FACES IN RETURN THE SUN WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN UPON THEIR MOURNING IF ULYSSES HAD NOT CHECKED THEM AND SAID CEASE YOUR WEEPING LEST SOME ONE SHOULD COME OUTSIDE AND SEE US
BUT PAPA SAID MISSUS GRANTLY GETTING UP
I OFFERED SELINA GOBY A FEATHER BED AND FIFTY SHILLINGS TO BE OFF THE BARGAIN YOU WILL HARDLY BELIEVE IT BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS TRUE
A DOCTOR DOES WHEN RECOMMENDED BY AN OLD WOMAN TO TAKE SOME FAVOURITE DOSE OR AS A LAWYER WHEN AN UNPROFESSIONAL MAN ATTEMPTS TO PUT HIM DOWN BY A QUIBBLE I SHALL HAVE THE LIVING OF CRABTREE MODESTLY SUGGESTED THE WARDEN
EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WITH THE HOUSE WITH NOTHING TO DO THE VERY PLACE FOR HIM
WHAT TO MORROW WE HATE I SAW MY WAY CLEAR DIRECTLY TO DAY I WAS ALL FOR CONTINUING TO BE FARM BAILIFF TO MORROW ON THE AUTHORITY OF ROBINSON CRUSOE I SHOULD BE ALL THE OTHER WAY TAKE MYSELF TO MORROW
THEN YOUR THREAT OF RESIGNATION AMOUNTS TO NOTHING AND WE ARE JUST WHERE WE WERE BEFORE MISTER HARDING WAS NOW STANDING ON THE RUG MOVING UNEASILY FROM ONE FOOT TO THE OTHER
IF YOU REQUIRE TO BE TOLD THAT MY LITTLE PENELOPE WAS TAKEN CARE OF UNDER MY GOOD MISTRESS'S OWN EYE AND WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AND TAUGHT AND MADE A SHARP GIRL AND PROMOTED WHEN OLD ENOUGH TO BE MISS RACHEL'S OWN MAID AS FOR ME
HOW DO YOU MEAN TO PAY THE MONSTROUS EXPENSES OF THIS ACTION MISSUS GRANTLY SUGGESTED THAT AS THE ACTION WAS ABANDONED THE COSTS WOULD NOT BE HEAVY INDEED THEY WILL MY DEAR CONTINUED HE
CONTINUED THE REVEREND CROSS EXAMINER MISTER HARDING COULD NOT DENY THIS I'M SURE SIR ABRAHAM MUST HAVE ADVISED YOU TO CONSULT YOUR FRIENDS TO THIS PROPOSITION ALSO MISTER HARDING WAS OBLIGED TO ASSENT
THERE I LIVED TILL MISS JULIA MARRIED THE LATE SIR JOHN VERINDER AN EXCELLENT MAN WHO ONLY WANTED SOMEBODY TO MANAGE HIM AND BETWEEN OURSELVES HE FOUND SOMEBODY TO DO IT AND WHAT IS MORE HE THROVE ON IT AND GREW FAT ON IT AND LIVED HAPPY AND DIED EASY ON IT
WHEN I WANTED TO GO UP STAIRS THERE WAS MY WIFE COMING DOWN
THAT IS MARRIED LIFE ACCORDING TO MY EXPERIENCE OF IT AFTER FIVE YEARS OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS ON THE STAIRS IT PLEASED AN ALL WISE PROVIDENCE TO RELIEVE US OF EACH OTHER BY TAKING MY WIFE
TO THE DAY WHEN SHE RELIEVED HIM OF HIS LAST BREATH AND CLOSED HIS EYES FOR EVER I HAVE OMITTED TO STATE THAT I WENT WITH THE BRIDE TO THE BRIDE'S HUSBAND'S HOUSE AND LANDS DOWN HERE SIR JOHN SHE SAYS
ONE CANNOT HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL UP AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT FOR NOTHING BUT OF COURSE YOUR FATHER HAS NOT THOUGHT OF THIS I WILL SELL MY FURNITURE SAID THE WARDEN FURNITURE EJACULATED THE OTHER
AND WENT ALL ROUND THE HOUSE AND THROUGH THE SHRUBBERY HAVING MADE SURE THAT NO PERSONS WERE LURKING ABOUT ANYWHERE IN OUR GROUNDS WE TURNED BACK PASSING OVER THE WALK WHERE I HAD SEEN THE SHADOW I NOW NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME
I WAS LEFT WITH MY LITTLE GIRL PENELOPE AND WITH NO OTHER CHILD SHORTLY AFTERWARDS SIR JOHN DIED AND MY LADY WAS LEFT WITH HER LITTLE GIRL MISS RACHEL AND NO OTHER CHILD I HAVE WRITTEN TO VERY POOR PURPOSE OF MY LADY
IN THE CHARACTER OF LADY VERINDER'S HOUSE STEWARD ALL QUITE COMFORTABLE AND ALL THROUGH ROBINSON CRUSOE MY DAUGHTER PENELOPE HAS JUST LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER TO SEE WHAT I HAVE DONE SO FAR
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE WARDEN IS VERY OBSTINATE DOCTOR GRANTLY IS HERE SIR GREETED HIS EARS BEFORE THE DOOR WAS WELL OPEN AND MISSUS GRANTLY
THAT A STRANGE GENTLEMAN COULD POSSESS ANY INTEREST FOR HER
WHEN SHE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT MISTER FRANKLIN THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN US CONDUCTED IN THIS WAY WAS TIRESOME ENOUGH UNTIL MY DAUGHTER SUDDENLY ENDED IT BY BURSTING OUT WITH WHAT I THOUGHT THE MOST MONSTROUS SUPPOSITION I HAD EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE
AND BEGAN TO DO SO BUT DOCTOR GRANTLY STOPPED HIM MY DEAR WARDEN SAID HE THIS IS ALL NONSENSE EIGHTY POUNDS OR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MAKES VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE YOU CAN'T LIVE ON IT YOU CAN'T RUIN ELEANOR'S PROSPECTS FOR EVER
THERE WAS A PAUSE FOR ABOUT A MINUTE AND THEN THE WARDEN FINDING THAT NOTHING ELSE WAS COMING LIGHTED HIS CANDLE AND QUIETLY SAID GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT PAPA SAID THE LADY
I WENT ON WITH MY BUSINESS AS BAILIFF YEAR AFTER YEAR UP TO CHRISTMAS EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN WHEN THERE CAME A CHANGE IN MY LIFE ON THAT DAY MY LADY INVITED HERSELF TO A CUP OF TEA ALONE WITH ME IN MY COTTAGE SHE REMARKED THAT
THEY HAVE A SITTING ROOM ABOVE AND ARE WAITING UP FOR YOU THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE TONE OF THE MAN'S VOICE WHICH SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT EVEN HE LOOKED UPON THE WARDEN AS A RUNAWAY SCHOOLBOY JUST RECAPTURED BY HIS GUARDIAN
WHICH WAS ONE REASON FOR MARRYING HER I HAD ANOTHER REASON LIKEWISE ENTIRELY OF MY OWN DISCOVERING SELINA BEING A SINGLE WOMAN MADE ME PAY SO MUCH A WEEK FOR HER BOARD AND SERVICES SELINA BEING MY WIFE
PENSION HIM LIBERALLY AND LET GABRIEL BETTEREDGE HAVE HIS PLACE ON THE TUESDAY AS IT MIGHT BE SIR JOHN SAYS MY LADY THE BAILIFF IS PENSIONED LIBERALLY AND GABRIEL BETTEREDGE HAS GOT HIS PLACE
I SAID NOTHING TO SAMUEL BUT REMEMBERING WHAT PENELOPE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE JUGGLERS AND THE POURING OF THE LITTLE POOL OF INK INTO THE PALM OF THE BOY'S HAND
EXPRESS DISAPPROBATION AND ASTONISHMENT WHAT WILL SIR ABRAHAM THINK OF IT
CAN BE IN ANY WAY BINDING ON YOU OF COURSE YOU WERE THERE TO ASK HIS ADVICE I'M SURE SIR ABRAHAM DID NOT ADVISE ANY SUCH STEP MISTER HARDING COULD NOT SAY THAT HE HAD I AM SURE HE DISADVISED YOU FROM IT
AND HE GAVE HIS DAUGHTER A KISS AND SHOOK HANDS WITH THE DOCTOR AND AGAIN TRIED TO LOOK UNCONCERNED
ASKED THE ARCHDEACON MISTER HARDING SIGNIFIED THAT HE HAD GOOD HEAVENS HOW UNFORTUNATE
THE ARCHDEACON THOUGHT HE KNEW HIS FATHER IN LAW BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD ALREADY TALKED OVER A VACILLATING MAN TO RESIGN HIS PROMISE COME SAID HE PROMISE SUSAN TO GIVE UP THIS IDEA OF RESIGNING THE WARDENSHIP
IN THE TIME OF THE OLD LORD I HAD BEEN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS IN HER SERVICE AND SHE PUT INTO MY HANDS A BEAUTIFUL WAISTCOAT OF WOOL THAT SHE HAD WORKED HERSELF TO KEEP ME WARM IN THE BITTER WINTER WEATHER
I SAID AND I THINK MY LADY IT WILL BE CHEAPER TO MARRY HER THAN TO KEEP HER MY LADY BURST OUT LAUGHING AND SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHICH TO BE MOST SHOCKED AT MY LANGUAGE OR MY PRINCIPLES SOME JOKE TICKLED HER I SUPPOSE
AND THE GALLERIES HAVE APPLAUDED WITH A COUPLE OF ROUNDS RESIGNED IT GOOD HEAVENS AND THE DIGNITARY OF THE CHURCH SANK BACK HORRIFIED INTO A HORSEHAIR ARM CHAIR AT LEAST
THE EVENING CAME AND THE DRESSING BELL FOR DINNER RANG BEFORE MISTER FRANKLIN RETURNED FROM FRIZINGHALL I TOOK HIS HOT WATER UP TO HIS ROOM MYSELF EXPECTING TO HEAR AFTER THIS EXTRAORDINARY DELAY
YOU HEAR MORE THAN ENOUGH OF MARRIED PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER MISERABLY HERE IS AN EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY LET IT BE A WARNING TO SOME OF YOU AND AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO OTHERS IN THE MEANTIME I WILL GO ON WITH MY STORY WELL
WHILE THEY WERE IN MY INTERESTING SITUATION AND THEY HAVE ALL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE IT HAPPENED THEY PRIVATELY WISHED THEMSELVES OUT OF IT I WENT A TRIFLE FURTHER THAN THAT MYSELF I ACTUALLY ROSE UP AS IT WERE AND TRIED TO GET OUT OF IT
WITH THE NATURAL CURIOSITY OF WOMEN TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION THIS TIME SHE ONLY WANTED ME TO TELL HER
WHAT IS ELEANOR TO DO IF YOU THROW AWAY YOUR INCOME A HOT TEAR STOOD IN EACH OF THE WARDEN'S EYES AS HE LOOKED ROUND UPON HIS MARRIED DAUGHTER WHY SHOULD ONE SISTER WHO WAS SO RICH PREDICT POVERTY FOR ANOTHER
HE DID NOT IN THE LEAST DOUBT HIS RESOLUTION BUT HE GREATLY DOUBTED HIS POWER OF DEFENDING IT AGAINST HIS SON IN LAW YOU MUST BE VERY TIRED SUSAN SAID HE WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO GO TO BED
I NEVER KNEW YOU CRUEL BEFORE FATHER SHE SAID VERY GENTLY AND WENT OUT MY GIRL'S WORDS FELL UPON ME LIKE A SPLASH OF COLD WATER I WAS SAVAGE WITH MYSELF FOR FEELING
BEING OLD AND SLY
AND HAD GONE OFF AGAIN ON HORSEBACK NEEDLESS ALSO TO SAY THAT THEY ASKED AWKWARD QUESTIONS DIRECTLY AND THAT THE FOREIGN POLITICS AND THE FALLING ASLEEP IN THE SUN WOULDN'T SERVE A SECOND TIME OVER WITH THEM BEING AT THE END OF MY INVENTION
MY DAUGHTER PENELOPE GOT IN MY WAY JUST AS HER LATE MOTHER USED TO GET IN MY WAY ON THE STAIRS AND INSTANTLY SUMMONED ME TO TELL HER ALL THAT HAD PASSED AT THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN MISTER FRANKLIN AND ME UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE ONE THING TO BE DONE
SO LONG AS MY MISTRESS AND I WERE TOGETHER SEEING THAT MY LADY TOOK AN INTEREST IN THE OUT OF DOOR WORK AND THE FARMS AND SUCH LIKE I TOOK AN INTEREST IN THEM TOO WITH ALL THE MORE REASON THAT I WAS A SMALL FARMER'S SEVENTH SON MYSELF
WILL TAKE CARE OF ME ALSO SAID MISTER HARDING WITH A SMILE AS THOUGH AFRAID OF GIVING OFFENCE BY MAKING HIS REFERENCE TO SCRIPTURE TOO SOLEMN PISH SAID THE ARCHDEACON TURNING AWAY RAPIDLY
IT'S TWELVE O'CLOCK YES MY DEAR SAID THE WARDEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL NAMED TEN FOR MY MEETING TO BE SURE TEN IS LATE BUT WHAT COULD I DO YOU KNOW GREAT MEN WILL HAVE THEIR OWN WAY
AND I HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF JUDGING AS YOU SHALL PRESENTLY SEE
NOT FOR NOTHING I WAS TOO JUST A MAN TO EXPECT SHE WOULD LET ME OFF FOR NOTHING COMPENSATION TO THE WOMAN WHEN THE MAN GETS OUT OF IT IS ONE OF THE LAWS OF ENGLAND
IN THIS BUSINESS OF THE DIAMOND HE HAD THE LONGEST TONGUE AND THE SHORTEST TEMPER OF ANY MAN HIGH OR LOW I EVER MET WITH I SAY I WENT INTO THE SERVICE OF THE OLD LORD AS PAGE BOY IN WAITING ON THE THREE HONOURABLE YOUNG LADIES AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN YEARS
AND SO THE WARDEN RETIRED BUT AS HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM HE HEARD THE WELL KNOWN EJACULATION
HAVING GOT OVER MY DIFFICULTIES WITH THE LADIES I FOUND MORE DIFFICULTIES WAITING FOR ME WHEN I WENT BACK TO MY OWN ROOM IN CAME PENELOPE WITH THE NATURAL SWEETNESS OF WOMEN TO KISS AND MAKE IT UP AGAIN AND
AND YOU WILL NOT DO THIS RASH THING THE LADY WAS REALLY MOVED BEYOND HER USUAL CALM COMPOSURE IT CAN NEVER BE RASH TO DO RIGHT SAID HE I SHALL CERTAINLY
EVER FIND THEIR OWN SELVES GETTING IN THE WAY OF THEIR SUBJECTS LIKE ME IF THEY DO I CAN FEEL FOR THEM IN THE MEANTIME HERE IS ANOTHER FALSE START AND MORE WASTE OF GOOD WRITING PAPER WHAT'S TO BE DONE NOW
REMEMBER WHAT ADAM WANTED WHEN HE WAS ALONE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND IF YOU DON'T BLAME IT IN ADAM DON'T BLAME IT IN ME THE WOMAN I FIXED MY EYE ON WAS THE WOMAN WHO KEPT HOUSE FOR ME AT MY COTTAGE HER NAME WAS SELINA GOBY
ISN'T IT ASKED THE WARDEN INNOCENTLY WELL AT ANY RATE I'VE DONE IT NOW SIR ABRAHAM DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK IT SO VERY STRANGE THE ARCHDEACON GAVE A SIGH THAT WOULD HAVE MOVED A MAN OF WAR
SAID THE LADY THE ARCHDEACON TOOK ANOTHER TURN AND AGAIN EJACULATED GOOD HEAVENS THIS TIME IN A VERY LOW WHISPER BUT STILL AUDIBLE I THINK I'LL GO TO BED SAID THE WARDEN
TAKING UP A SIDE CANDLE AT ANY RATE YOU'LL PROMISE ME TO TAKE NO FURTHER STEP WITHOUT CONSULTATION SAID THE ARCHDEACON MISTER HARDING MADE NO ANSWER BUT SLOWLY PROCEEDED TO LIGHT HIS CANDLE
WAS ENTIRELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ONE OF MISTER FRANKLIN'S FREAKS BEING ASKED UPON THAT WHETHER HIS GALLOPING OFF AGAIN ON HORSEBACK WAS ANOTHER OF MISTER FRANKLIN'S FREAKS I SAID YES IT WAS AND SLIPPED OUT OF IT I THINK VERY CLEVERLY IN THAT WAY
WAS NOT IN HIS MIND A MATTER OF ANY DOUBT HE KNEW HIS OWN WEAKNESS HE KNEW HOW PRONE HE WAS TO BE LED BUT HE WAS NOT WEAK ENOUGH TO GIVE WAY NOW TO GO BACK FROM THE POSITION TO WHICH HIS CONSCIENCE HAD DRIVEN HIM
HE MADE NO DISTINCT ANSWER TO THE ARCHDEACON'S LAST PROPOSITION FOR HIS MIND WAS CHIEFLY ENGAGED ON THINKING HOW HE COULD ESCAPE TO BED THAT HIS RESIGNATION WAS A THING FINALLY FIXED ON A FACT ALL BUT COMPLETED
AGAINST THE INDIGNITY OF TAKING MY EASE AS I COULD BUT MY MISTRESS KNEW THE WEAK SIDE OF ME SHE PUT IT AS A FAVOUR TO HERSELF THE DISPUTE BETWEEN US ENDED AFTER THAT IN MY WIPING MY EYES LIKE AN OLD FOOL WITH MY NEW WOOLLEN WAISTCOAT
HOW IT WAS I DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT WE ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE
THE NEWS BROUGHT TO ME FROM THE UPPER REGIONS THAT EVENING CAME FROM PENELOPE AND THE FOOTMAN PENELOPE MENTIONED THAT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN MISS RACHEL SO PARTICULAR ABOUT THE DRESSING OF HER HAIR AND HAD NEVER SEEN HER LOOK SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY
WHEN I ENDEAVOURED TO LEAD THE CONVERSATION TO MORE SERIOUS THINGS TOWARDS MIDNIGHT I WENT ROUND THE HOUSE TO LOCK UP ACCOMPANIED BY MY SECOND IN COMMAND SAMUEL THE FOOTMAN AS USUAL
BUT THE BROAD MOONLIGHT SHOWED FAIR ON THE GRAVEL WALK THAT RAN ALONG THE NEXT SIDE TO THE TERRACE LOOKING THIS WAY AFTER LOOKING UP AT THE SKY I SAW THE SHADOW OF A PERSON IN THE MOONLIGHT THROWN FORWARD FROM BEHIND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
WITH A LITTLE COTTAGE OF MY OWN TO LIVE IN WITH MY ROUNDS ON THE ESTATE TO OCCUPY ME IN THE MORNING AND MY ACCOUNTS IN THE AFTERNOON AND MY PIPE AND MY ROBINSON CRUSOE IN THE EVENING WHAT MORE COULD I POSSIBLY WANT TO MAKE ME HAPPY
IS A REAL COMFORT AT STARTING IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THE FASHIONABLE WORLD YOU HAVE HEARD TELL OF THE THREE BEAUTIFUL MISS HERNCASTLES MISS ADELAIDE MISS CAROLINE
HAD THEY HEARD ANYTHING OF EACH OTHER IMPOSSIBLE AGAIN I COULD SPEAK TO MISTER FRANKLIN'S ASTONISHMENT AS GENUINE WHEN HE SAW HOW THE GIRL STARED AT HIM PENELOPE COULD SPEAK TO THE GIRL'S INQUISITIVENESS AS GENUINE
AND SO I RESIGNED THE WARDENSHIP RESIGNED IT SAID THE ARCHDEACON IN A SOLEMN VOICE SAD AND LOW
AND SCRIBBLING MISTER FRANKLIN'S NAME INSIDE HER WORKBOX SHE HAD BEEN SURPRISED AGAIN CRYING AND LOOKING AT HER DEFORMED SHOULDER IN THE GLASS HAD SHE AND MISTER FRANKLIN KNOWN ANYTHING OF EACH OTHER BEFORE TO DAY QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
WITH A MOST POWERFUL SNEER COME ARCHDEACON SAID THE LADY
I AGREE WITH THE LATE WILLIAM COBBETT ABOUT PICKING A WIFE SEE THAT SHE CHEWS HER FOOD WELL AND SETS HER FOOT DOWN FIRMLY ON THE GROUND WHEN SHE WALKS AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT SELINA GOBY WAS ALL RIGHT IN BOTH THESE RESPECTS
SAID THE WARDEN AND TO PREVENT THAT CONTINUED THE OTHER WE MUSTN'T LET ANY TALK OF RESIGNATION GET ABROAD BUT I SHALL RESIGN SAID THE WARDEN VERY VERY MEEKLY GOOD HEAVENS
AND THAT HE PITIED THE CULPRIT THOUGH HE COULD NOT BUT BE HORRIFIED AT THE CRIME THE WARDEN ENDEAVOURED TO APPEAR UNCONCERNED AS HE SAID OH INDEED I'LL GO UPSTAIRS AT ONCE BUT HE FAILED SIGNALLY
MY FEET BETRAYED ME ON THE GRAVEL BEFORE I COULD STEAL SUDDENLY ROUND THE CORNER AS I HAD PROPOSED I HEARD LIGHTER FEET THAN MINE AND MORE THAN ONE PAIR OF THEM AS I THOUGHT RETREATING IN A HURRY
AND WERE HIDDEN FROM SIGHT AMONG THE THICK TREES AND BUSHES IN THAT PART OF THE GROUNDS FROM THE SHRUBBERY THEY COULD EASILY MAKE THEIR WAY OVER OUR FENCE INTO THE ROAD IF I HAD BEEN FORTY YEARS YOUNGER
THE ARCHDEACON WAS PACING THE ROOM EXPRESSING BY CERTAIN NODS OF HIS HEAD HIS OPINION OF THE UTTER FATUITY OF HIS FATHER IN LAW WHY AT LAST HE SAID
BY THE TIME I HAD GOT TO THE CORNER THE TRESPASSERS WHOEVER THEY WERE
SOME SUCH IDEA AS THIS WAS ON HIS MIND BUT HE GAVE NO UTTERANCE TO IT THEN HE THOUGHT OF THE PELICAN FEEDING ITS YOUNG WITH BLOOD FROM ITS OWN BREAST BUT HE GAVE NO UTTERANCE TO THAT EITHER AND THEN OF ELEANOR
A SORT OF WHISPER
THE WARDEN LOOKED AT HIS DAUGHTER THINKING PROBABLY AT THE MOMENT THAT IF ELEANOR WERE CONTENTED WITH HIM
AND ANGELS MIGHT HAVE BLUSHED AT THE REBUKE EXPRESSED IN HIS TONE AND EMPHASIS WHY DID YOU GO OFF FROM BARCHESTER SO SUDDENLY WHY DID YOU TAKE SUCH A STEP WITHOUT GIVING US NOTICE AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED AT THE PALACE
I CAME ON A COMFORTING BIT PAGE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT AS FOLLOWS
AND SAID I AM SURE SUSAN WILL NOT ASK ME TO BREAK MY WORD OR TO DO WHAT I KNOW TO BE WRONG PAPA SAID SHE IT WOULD BE MADNESS IN YOU TO THROW UP YOUR PREFERMENT WHAT ARE YOU TO LIVE ON
THERE WAS PERHAPS A RAY OF COMFORT IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS MARRIED DAUGHTER THAT IS TO SAY OF COMPARATIVE COMFORT SEEING THAT HIS SON IN LAW WAS THERE
WHEN ALL THE DOORS WERE MADE FAST EXCEPT THE SIDE DOOR THAT OPENED ON THE TERRACE I SENT SAMUEL TO BED AND STEPPED OUT FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR BEFORE I TOO
AND SHE HAD COME TO MY COTTAGE TO WHEEDLE ME IF I MAY USE SUCH AN EXPRESSION INTO GIVING UP MY HARD OUT OF DOOR WORK AS BAILIFF AND TAKING MY EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AS STEWARD IN THE HOUSE I MADE AS GOOD A FIGHT OF IT
IF THE RAVENS PERSISTED IN REFUSING THE FOOD PREPARED FOR THEM THEY WOULDN'T BE FED A CLERGYMAN GENERALLY DISLIKES TO BE MET IN ARGUMENT BY ANY SCRIPTURAL QUOTATION HE FEELS AS AFFRONTED AS
THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO MY GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT AND NO DOUBT TO YOURS ALSO NOTHING HAD HAPPENED HE HAD NOT MET WITH THE INDIANS EITHER GOING OR RETURNING HE HAD DEPOSITED THE MOONSTONE IN THE BANK
THE WARDEN HUNG HIS HEAD AND MADE NO REPLY HE COULD NOT CONDESCEND TO SAY THAT HE HAD NOT INTENDED TO GIVE HIS SON IN LAW THE SLIP AND AS HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AVOW IT HE SAID NOTHING PAPA HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU
OF COURSE SHE SAID YES AS MY TIME DREW NEARER
I CAN'T DO WITHOUT GABRIEL BETTEREDGE MY LADY SAYS SIR JOHN I CAN'T DO WITHOUT HIM EITHER THAT WAS HIS WAY WITH HER AND THAT WAS HOW I WENT INTO HIS SERVICE IT WAS ALL ONE TO ME WHERE I WENT
THAT HAD EVER TRIED HIS TRAINING IN SERVICE LATER IN THE EVENING WE HEARD THEM SINGING AND PLAYING DUETS MISTER FRANKLIN PIPING HIGH MISS RACHEL PIPING HIGHER AND MY LADY ON THE PIANO FOLLOWING THEM AS IT WERE OVER HEDGE AND DITCH
AND DEPEND ON THE NATURAL SWEETNESS OF WOMEN FOR KISSING AND MAKING IT UP AGAIN AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY THE AFTERNOON WORE ON AND MY LADY AND MISS RACHEL CAME BACK NEEDLESS TO SAY HOW ASTONISHED THEY WERE WHEN THEY HEARD THAT MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE HAD ARRIVED
YOU KNOW YOU NEVER EXPECTED PAPA TO PAY THE COSTS SUCH ABSURDITY IS ENOUGH TO PROVOKE JOB SAID THE ARCHDEACON MARCHING QUICKLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM YOUR FATHER IS LIKE A CHILD EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR
SHE HAD BEEN MERRY WITHOUT REASON AND SAD WITHOUT REASON IN ONE BREATH SHE ASKED HUNDREDS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE AND IN ANOTHER BREATH
WHILE IN TO MORROW'S HUMOUR AND THE THING WAS DONE MY MIND BEING RELIEVED IN THIS MANNER I WENT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT IN THE CHARACTER OF LADY VERINDER'S FARM BAILIFF
YOU HAVE HEARD OF BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADIES FALLING IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT AND HAVE THOUGHT IT NATURAL ENOUGH BUT A HOUSEMAID OUT OF A REFORMATORY WITH A PLAIN FACE AND A DEFORMED SHOULDER FALLING IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
I ACCORDINGLY REPLIED THAT MISTER FRANKLIN AND I HAD BOTH TALKED OF FOREIGN POLITICS TILL WE COULD TALK NO LONGER AND HAD THEN MUTUALLY FALLEN ASLEEP IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN TRY THAT SORT OF ANSWER WHEN YOUR WIFE OR YOUR DAUGHTER
FATHER SAYS PENELOPE QUITE SERIOUSLY THERE'S ONLY ONE EXPLANATION OF IT ROSANNA HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE AT FIRST SIGHT
DESCRIBING IT MERELY AS A VALUABLE OF GREAT PRICE AND HE HAD GOT THE RECEIPT FOR IT SAFE IN HIS POCKET I WENT DOWN STAIRS
IT WAS SO SILENT OUT OF DOORS THAT I HEARD FROM TIME TO TIME VERY FAINT AND LOW THE FALL OF THE SEA AS THE GROUND SWELL HEAVED IT IN ON THE SAND BANK NEAR THE MOUTH OF OUR LITTLE BAY AS THE HOUSE STOOD THE TERRACE SIDE WAS THE DARK SIDE
AND OF COURSE I MUST NOW DO SO NOT AT ALL SAID THE ARCHDEACON CATCHING A RAY OF HOPE
AFTER THAT IT WAS ALL OVER WITH ME OF COURSE I GOT THE NEW COAT AS CHEAP AS I COULD AND I WENT THROUGH ALL THE REST OF IT AS CHEAP AS I COULD WE WERE NOT A HAPPY COUPLE AND NOT A MISERABLE COUPLE WE WERE SIX OF ONE AND HALF A DOZEN OF THE OTHER
AND SEEING THEM SAFE THROUGH IT IN A MANNER MOST WONDERFUL AND PLEASANT TO HEAR THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOWS ON THE TERRACE AT NIGHT LATER STILL I WENT TO MISTER FRANKLIN IN THE SMOKING ROOM WITH THE SODA WATER AND BRANDY AND FOUND THAT MISS RACHEL HAD PUT THE DIAMOND CLEAN OUT OF HIS HEAD
CHAPTER TWO I SPOKE OF MY LADY A LINE OR TWO BACK NOW THE DIAMOND COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN OUR HOUSE WHERE IT WAS LOST IF IT HAD NOT BEEN MADE A PRESENT OF TO MY LADY'S DAUGHTER AND MY LADY'S DAUGHTER
AFTER ALL OUR EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE DIAMOND EARLIER IN THE DAY HOW THE MEETING BETWEEN MISTER FRANKLIN AND HIS AUNT AND COUSIN WENT OFF IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL YOU I WOULD HAVE GIVEN SOMETHING TO HAVE WAITED AT TABLE THAT DAY
WELL I HAVE DONE MY DUTY IF HE CHOOSES TO RUIN HIS CHILD I CANNOT HELP IT AND HE STOOD STILL AT THE FIRE PLACE AND LOOKED AT HIMSELF IN A DINGY MIRROR WHICH STOOD ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE
BUT SUSAN DIDN'T WANT TO GO TILL HER HUSBAND WENT SHE HAD AN IDEA THAT HER PAPA MIGHT BE BULLIED IF SHE WERE AWAY SHE WASN'T TIRED AT ALL
EIGHTY POUNDS A YEAR SNEERED THE ARCHDEACON AND THE PRECENTORSHIP SAID THE FATHER IN LAW IT GOES WITH THE WARDENSHIP SAID THE SON IN LAW MISTER HARDING WAS PREPARED TO ARGUE THIS POINT
HOWEVER UPSTAIRS HE WENT THE WAITER SLOWLY PRECEDING HIM AND ON THE DOOR BEING OPENED THE ARCHDEACON WAS DISCOVERED STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM ERECT INDEED AS USUAL BUT OH HOW SORROWFUL
MY MIND BEGAN TO MISGIVE ME I HAVE COMPARED NOTES WITH OTHER MEN
AFTER LEAVING MISTER FRANKLIN AND ME AT THE SHIVERING SAND ROSANNA IT APPEARED HAD RETURNED TO THE HOUSE IN A VERY UNACCOUNTABLE STATE OF MIND SHE HAD TURNED IF PENELOPE WAS TO BE BELIEVED ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
RESIGN THIS WARDENSHIP THEN MISTER HARDING THERE IS NOTHING BEFORE YOU BUT RUIN SAID THE ARCHDEACON NOW MOVED BEYOND ALL ENDURANCE
MY LADY GOT ME PUT UNDER THE BAILIFF AND I DID MY BEST AND GAVE SATISFACTION AND GOT PROMOTION ACCORDINGLY SOME YEARS LATER ON THE MONDAY AS IT MIGHT BE MY LADY SAYS SIR JOHN YOUR BAILIFF IS A STUPID OLD MAN
I RECEIVED THIS MAGNIFICENT PRESENT QUITE AT A LOSS TO FIND WORDS TO THANK MY MISTRESS WITH FOR THE HONOUR SHE HAD DONE ME
BOLD HAS BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON HIS ACTION AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO REMAIN QUIET AT THE HOSPITAL MISTER HARDING STILL MADE NO REPLY BUT LOOKED MEEKLY INTO HIS SON IN LAW'S FACE
EVERY WORD OF IT TRUE BUT SHE POINTS OUT ONE OBJECTION SHE SAYS WHAT I HAVE DONE SO FAR ISN'T IN THE LEAST WHAT I WAS WANTED TO DO
A LITTLE BRIGHT OBJECT LYING ON THE CLEAN GRAVEL UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE MOON PICKING THE OBJECT UP I DISCOVERED IT WAS A SMALL BOTTLE CONTAINING A THICK SWEET SMELLING LIQUOR AS BLACK AS INK
IF YOUR DAUGHTER SHOULD HAVE A DANGEROUS FIT OF ILLNESS IF SHE SHOULD DIE IT WOULD BE A COMFORT TO KNOW THAT IT WAS ALL IN PURSUIT OF MISTER BINGLEY AND UNDER YOUR ORDERS OH I AM NOT AFRAID OF HER DYING PEOPLE DO NOT DIE OF LITTLE TRIFLING COLDS
SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA I COULD HARDLY KEEP MY COUNTENANCE
IF WHAT I HAVE HITHERTO SAID CAN APPEAR TO YOU IN THE FORM OF ENCOURAGEMENT I KNOW NOT HOW TO EXPRESS MY REFUSAL IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CONVINCE YOU OF ITS BEING ONE YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO FLATTER MYSELF MY DEAR COUSIN THAT YOUR REFUSAL OF MY ADDRESSES IS MERELY WORDS OF COURSE
AND JANE WHO HAD ONLY BEEN WITHHELD BY THE FEAR OF GIVING ALARM OR INCONVENIENCE FROM EXPRESSING IN HER NOTE HOW MUCH SHE LONGED FOR SUCH A VISIT WAS DELIGHTED AT HER ENTRANCE SHE WAS NOT EQUAL HOWEVER TO MUCH CONVERSATION
THEREFORE DO NOT BE ALARMED IF YOU SHOULD HEAR OF HIS HAVING BEEN TO ME AND EXCEPTING A SORE THROAT AND HEADACHE THERE IS NOT MUCH THE MATTER WITH ME YOURS ET CETERA WELL MY DEAR SAID MISTER BENNET WHEN ELIZABETH HAD READ THE NOTE ALOUD
AND I AM PERSUADED THAT WHEN SANCTIONED BY THE EXPRESS AUTHORITY OF BOTH YOUR EXCELLENT PARENTS MY PROPOSALS WILL NOT FAIL OF BEING ACCEPTABLE TO SUCH PERSEVERANCE IN WILFUL SELF DECEPTION ELIZABETH WOULD MAKE NO REPLY
ESPECIALLY WHEN TEMPERED WITH THE SILENCE AND RESPECT WHICH HER RANK WILL INEVITABLY EXCITE THUS MUCH FOR MY GENERAL INTENTION IN FAVOUR OF MATRIMONY IT REMAINS TO BE TOLD WHY MY VIEWS WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS LONGBOURN INSTEAD OF MY OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
WALKING WAS HER ONLY ALTERNATIVE SHE DECLARED HER RESOLUTION HOW CAN YOU BE SO SILLY CRIED HER MOTHER AS TO THINK OF SUCH A THING IN ALL THIS DIRT YOU WILL NOT BE FIT TO BE SEEN WHEN YOU GET THERE I SHALL BE VERY FIT TO SEE JANE WHICH IS ALL I WANT
AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE THAT IS RATHER SINGULAR
BY WHOM ELIZABETH SAT HE WAS AN INDOLENT MAN WHO LIVED ONLY TO EAT DRINK AND PLAY AT CARDS WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE
THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY HIS ANXIETY FOR JANE WAS EVIDENT
SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY HOW YOUNG LADIES CAN HAVE PATIENCE TO BE SO VERY ACCOMPLISHED AS THEY ALL ARE
MISTER BENNET'S PROPERTY CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY IN AN ESTATE OF TWO THOUSAND A YEAR WHICH UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIS DAUGHTERS WAS ENTAILED IN DEFAULT OF HEIRS MALE ON A DISTANT RELATION AND THEIR MOTHER'S FORTUNE
NEGLECT I AM SURE YOU NEGLECT NOTHING THAT CAN ADD TO THE BEAUTIES OF THAT NOBLE PLACE CHARLES WHEN YOU BUILD YOUR HOUSE I WISH IT MAY BE HALF AS DELIGHTFUL AS PEMBERLEY I WISH IT MAY
AND IMMEDIATELY AND IN SILENCE WITHDREW DETERMINED IF HE PERSISTED IN CONSIDERING HER REPEATED REFUSALS AS FLATTERING ENCOURAGEMENT TO APPLY TO HER FATHER WHOSE NEGATIVE MIGHT BE UTTERED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO BE DECISIVE
AND MAY TAKE POSSESSION OF LONGBOURN ESTATE WHENEVER IT FALLS WITHOUT ANY SELF REPROACH THIS MATTER MAY BE CONSIDERED THEREFORE AS FINALLY SETTLED AND RISING AS SHE THUS SPOKE SHE WOULD HAVE QUITTED THE ROOM HAD MISTER COLLINS NOT THUS ADDRESSED HER
WHEN SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF SEEING HER SLEEP AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER RATHER RIGHT THAN PLEASANT THAT SHE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS HERSELF ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE FOUND THE WHOLE PARTY AT LOO AND WAS IMMEDIATELY INVITED TO JOIN THEM BUT SUSPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYING HIGH SHE DECLINED IT
ON THAT HEAD THEREFORE I SHALL BE UNIFORMLY SILENT AND YOU MAY ASSURE YOURSELF THAT NO UNGENEROUS REPROACH SHALL EVER PASS MY LIPS WHEN WE ARE MARRIED IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO INTERRUPT HIM NOW
I REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN I LIKED A RED COAT MYSELF VERY WELL AND INDEED SO I DO STILL AT MY HEART AND IF A SMART YOUNG COLONEL WITH FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND A YEAR SHOULD WANT ONE OF MY GIRLS I SHALL NOT SAY NAY TO HIM
THOUGH AMPLE FOR HER SITUATION IN LIFE COULD BUT ILL SUPPLY THE DEFICIENCY OF HIS HER FATHER HAD BEEN AN ATTORNEY IN MERYTON AND HAD LEFT HER FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS SHE HAD A SISTER MARRIED TO A MISTER PHILLIPS
SHE IS REALLY A VERY SWEET GIRL AND I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART SHE WERE WELL SETTLED BUT WITH SUCH A FATHER AND MOTHER AND SUCH LOW CONNECTIONS I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO CHANCE OF IT I THINK I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT THEIR UNCLE IS AN ATTORNEY IN MERYTON YES
WERE YOUR FRIEND LADY CATHERINE TO KNOW ME I AM PERSUADED SHE WOULD FIND ME IN EVERY RESPECT ILL QUALIFIED FOR THE SITUATION WERE IT CERTAIN THAT LADY CATHERINE WOULD THINK SO SAID MISTER COLLINS VERY GRAVELY
AND WHERE HER APPEARANCE CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF SURPRISE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE WALKED THREE MILES SO EARLY IN THE DAY IN SUCH DIRTY WEATHER AND BY HERSELF WAS ALMOST INCREDIBLE TO MISSUS HURST AND MISS BINGLEY
IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS AND THEN YOU HAVE ADDED SO MUCH TO IT YOURSELF YOU ARE ALWAYS BUYING BOOKS I CANNOT COMPREHEND THE NEGLECT OF A FAMILY LIBRARY IN SUCH DAYS AS THESE
HER INQUIRIES AFTER HER SISTER WERE NOT VERY FAVOURABLY ANSWERED MISS BENNET HAD SLEPT ILL AND THOUGH UP WAS VERY FEVERISH AND NOT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE HER ROOM ELIZABETH WAS GLAD TO BE TAKEN TO HER IMMEDIATELY
ELIZABETH WOULD NOT OPPOSE SUCH AN INJUNCTION AND A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION MAKING HER ALSO SENSIBLE THAT IT WOULD BE WISEST TO GET IT OVER AS SOON AND AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND TRIED TO CONCEAL
WHO WERE USUALLY TEMPTED THITHER THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK TO PAY THEIR DUTY TO THEIR AUNT AND TO A MILLINER'S SHOP JUST OVER THE WAY THE TWO YOUNGEST OF THE FAMILY CATHERINE AND LYDIA WERE PARTICULARLY FREQUENT IN THESE ATTENTIONS THEIR MINDS WERE MORE VACANT THAN THEIR SISTERS
AND ELIZABETH WAS CONVINCED THAT THEY HELD HER IN CONTEMPT FOR IT SHE WAS RECEIVED HOWEVER VERY POLITELY BY THEM AND IN THEIR BROTHER'S MANNERS THERE WAS SOMETHING BETTER THAN POLITENESS THERE WAS GOOD HUMOUR AND KINDNESS MISTER DARCY SAID VERY LITTLE
I AM NOT A GREAT READER AND I HAVE PLEASURE IN MANY THINGS IN NURSING YOUR SISTER I AM SURE YOU HAVE PLEASURE SAID BINGLEY AND I HOPE IT WILL BE SOON INCREASED BY SEEING HER QUITE WELL ELIZABETH THANKED HIM FROM HER HEART
BUT ABLE TO MAKE A SMALL INCOME GO A GOOD WAY THIS IS MY ADVICE FIND SUCH A WOMAN AS SOON AS YOU CAN BRING HER TO HUNSFORD AND I WILL VISIT HER ALLOW ME BY THE WAY TO OBSERVE MY FAIR COUSIN
AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
I WOULD RATHER BE PAID THE COMPLIMENT OF BEING BELIEVED SINCERE I THANK YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR THE HONOUR YOU HAVE DONE ME IN YOUR PROPOSALS BUT TO ACCEPT THEM IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE MY FEELINGS IN EVERY RESPECT FORBID IT CAN I SPEAK PLAINER
SAID CATHERINE AND LYDIA ELIZABETH ACCEPTED THEIR COMPANY AND THE THREE YOUNG LADIES SET OFF TOGETHER IF WE MAKE HASTE SAID LYDIA AS THEY WALKED ALONG PERHAPS WE MAY SEE SOMETHING OF CAPTAIN CARTER BEFORE HE GOES IN MERYTON THEY PARTED
I ADMIRE THE ACTIVITY OF YOUR BENEVOLENCE OBSERVED MARY BUT EVERY IMPULSE OF FEELING SHOULD BE GUIDED BY REASON AND IN MY OPINION EXERTION SHOULD ALWAYS BE IN PROPORTION TO WHAT IS REQUIRED WE WILL GO AS FAR AS MERYTON WITH YOU
THAT I DO NOT RECKON THE NOTICE AND KINDNESS OF LADY CATHERINE DE BOURGH AS AMONG THE LEAST OF THE ADVANTAGES IN MY POWER TO OFFER YOU WILL FIND HER MANNERS BEYOND ANYTHING I CAN DESCRIBE AND YOUR WIT AND VIVACITY I THINK MUST BE ACCEPTABLE TO HER
WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE ARE MANY AMIABLE YOUNG WOMEN BUT THE FACT IS THAT BEING AS I AM TO INHERIT THIS ESTATE AFTER THE DEATH OF YOUR HONOURED FATHER WHO HOWEVER MAY LIVE MANY YEARS LONGER
SINCE I AM WELL AWARE THAT IT COULD NOT BE COMPLIED WITH AND THAT ONE THOUSAND POUNDS IN THE FOUR PER CENTS WHICH WILL NOT BE YOURS TILL AFTER YOUR MOTHER'S DECEASE IS ALL THAT YOU MAY EVER BE ENTITLED TO
AND SHALL HOPE TO LEAD YOU TO THE ALTAR ERE LONG UPON MY WORD SIR CRIED ELIZABETH YOUR HOPE IS A RATHER EXTRAORDINARY ONE AFTER MY DECLARATION I DO ASSURE YOU THAT I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE YOUNG LADIES IF SUCH YOUNG LADIES THERE ARE
AND ELIZABETH BEGAN TO LIKE THEM HERSELF WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH AFFECTION AND SOLICITUDE THEY SHOWED FOR JANE THE APOTHECARY CAME AND HAVING EXAMINED HIS PATIENT SAID AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT SHE HAD CAUGHT A VIOLENT COLD
BUT IN MY OPINION IT IS A PALTRY DEVICE A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED THERE IS A MEANNESS IN ALL THE ARTS WHICH LADIES SOMETIMES CONDESCEND TO EMPLOY FOR CAPTIVATION
VERY NONSENSICAL TO COME AT ALL WHY MUST SHE BE SCAMPERING ABOUT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE HER SISTER HAD A COLD HER HAIR SO UNTIDY SO BLOWSY YES AND HER PETTICOAT I HOPE YOU SAW HER PETTICOAT SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM
ELIZABETH BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON HER IS ONE OF THOSE YOUNG LADIES WHO SEEK TO RECOMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE OTHER SEX BY UNDERVALUING THEIR OWN AND WITH MANY MEN I DARE SAY IT SUCCEEDS
YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT OH CERTAINLY CRIED HIS FAITHFUL ASSISTANT NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING
CERTAINLY NOT TO WALK THREE MILES OR FOUR MILES OR FIVE MILES OR WHATEVER IT IS ABOVE HER ANKLES IN DIRT AND ALONE QUITE ALONE WHAT COULD SHE MEAN BY IT IT SEEMS TO ME TO SHOW AN ABOMINABLE SORT OF CONCEITED INDEPENDENCE
AND SHE WAS EAGERLY CALLING OUT WHILE HER DAUGHTER READ WELL JANE WHO IS IT FROM WHAT IS IT ABOUT WHAT DOES HE SAY WELL JANE MAKE HASTE AND TELL US MAKE HASTE MY LOVE IT IS FROM MISS BINGLEY SAID JANE AND THEN READ IT ALOUD
THAT I HAVE YOUR RESPECTED MOTHER'S PERMISSION FOR THIS ADDRESS YOU CAN HARDLY DOUBT THE PURPORT OF MY DISCOURSE HOWEVER YOUR NATURAL DELICACY MAY LEAD YOU TO DISSEMBLE MY ATTENTIONS HAVE BEEN TOO MARKED TO BE MISTAKEN
BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO OTHERWISE THAN TO DECLINE THEM I AM NOT NOW TO LEARN REPLIED MISTER COLLINS WITH A FORMAL WAVE OF THE HAND THAT IT IS USUAL WITH YOUNG LADIES TO REJECT THE ADDRESSES OF THE MAN
I SHALL CHOOSE TO ATTRIBUTE IT TO YOUR WISH OF INCREASING MY LOVE BY SUSPENSE ACCORDING TO THE USUAL PRACTICE OF ELEGANT FEMALES I DO ASSURE YOU SIR THAT I HAVE NO PRETENSIONS WHATEVER TO THAT KIND OF ELEGANCE WHICH CONSISTS IN TORMENTING A RESPECTABLE MAN
ELIZABETH DID NOT QUIT HER ROOM FOR A MOMENT NOR WERE THE OTHER LADIES OFTEN ABSENT THE GENTLEMEN BEING OUT THEY HAD IN FACT NOTHING TO DO ELSEWHERE WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK THREE ELIZABETH FELT THAT SHE MUST GO AND VERY UNWILLINGLY SAID SO
LIKE MYSELF TO SET THE EXAMPLE OF MATRIMONY IN HIS PARISH SECONDLY THAT I AM CONVINCED THAT IT WILL ADD VERY GREATLY TO MY HAPPINESS AND THIRDLY WHICH PERHAPS I OUGHT TO HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER
BEFORE ELIZABETH HAD TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT A BLUSH OF SURPRISE MISSUS BENNET ANSWERED INSTANTLY OH DEAR YES CERTAINLY I AM SURE LIZZY WILL BE VERY HAPPY I AM SURE SHE CAN HAVE NO OBJECTION COME KITTY
YOU ARE TOO HASTY SIR SHE CRIED YOU FORGET THAT I HAVE MADE NO ANSWER LET ME DO IT WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS OF TIME ACCEPT MY THANKS FOR THE COMPLIMENT YOU ARE PAYING ME I AM VERY SENSIBLE OF THE HONOUR OF YOUR PROPOSALS
MY REASONS FOR BELIEVING IT ARE BRIEFLY THESE IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT MY HAND IS UNWORTHY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OR THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT I CAN OFFER WOULD BE ANY OTHER THAN HIGHLY DESIRABLE
BY INCESSANT EMPLOYMENT THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN DISTRESS AND DIVERSION MISSUS BENNET AND KITTY WALKED OFF AND AS SOON AS THEY WERE GONE MISTER COLLINS BEGAN BELIEVE ME MY DEAR MISS ELIZABETH
AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER WHO LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR CHEAPSIDE THAT IS CAPITAL ADDED HER SISTER AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY IF THEY HAD UNCLES ENOUGH TO FILL ALL CHEAPSIDE CRIED BINGLEY IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEM ONE JOT LESS AGREEABLE
THEY COULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT OFFICERS AND MISTER BINGLEY'S LARGE FORTUNE THE MENTION OF WHICH GAVE ANIMATION TO THEIR MOTHER WAS WORTHLESS IN THEIR EYES WHEN OPPOSED TO THE REGIMENTALS OF AN ENSIGN AFTER LISTENING ONE MORNING TO THEIR EFFUSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT
COME AS SOON AS YOU CAN ON RECEIPT OF THIS MY BROTHER AND THE GENTLEMEN ARE TO DINE WITH THE OFFICERS YOURS EVER CAROLINE BINGLEY WITH THE OFFICERS CRIED LYDIA I WONDER MY AUNT DID NOT TELL US OF THAT
I RATHER WONDER NOW AT YOUR KNOWING ANY ARE YOU SO SEVERE UPON YOUR OWN SEX AS TO DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THIS I NEVER SAW SUCH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW SUCH CAPACITY AND TASTE AND APPLICATION AND ELEGANCE AS YOU DESCRIBE UNITED
ALL THIS SHE MUST POSSESS ADDED DARCY AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
THEY ARE WANTED IN THE FARM MISTER BENNET ARE THEY NOT THEY ARE WANTED IN THE FARM MUCH OFTENER THAN I CAN GET THEM BUT IF YOU HAVE GOT THEM TO DAY SAID ELIZABETH MY MOTHER'S PURPOSE WILL BE ANSWERED
AND PAY ME THE COMPLIMENT OF BELIEVING WHAT I SAY I WISH YOU VERY HAPPY AND VERY RICH AND BY REFUSING YOUR HAND DO ALL IN MY POWER TO PREVENT YOUR BEING OTHERWISE IN MAKING ME THE OFFER YOU MUST HAVE SATISFIED THE DELICACY OF YOUR FEELINGS WITH REGARD TO MY FAMILY
WHEN I DO MYSELF THE HONOUR OF SPEAKING TO YOU NEXT ON THE SUBJECT I SHALL HOPE TO RECEIVE A MORE FAVOURABLE ANSWER THAN YOU HAVE NOW GIVEN ME THOUGH I AM FAR FROM ACCUSING YOU OF CRUELTY AT PRESENT
WHILE HIS SISTERS CONVINCED THAT NO COUNTRY ADVICE COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE RECOMMENDED AN EXPRESS TO TOWN FOR ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS THIS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BROTHER'S PROPOSAL
VERY UNWELL THIS MORNING WHICH I SUPPOSE IS TO BE IMPUTED TO MY GETTING WET THROUGH YESTERDAY MY KIND FRIENDS WILL NOT HEAR OF MY RETURNING TILL I AM BETTER THEY INSIST ALSO ON MY SEEING MISTER JONES
IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT ANOTHER OFFER OF MARRIAGE MAY EVER BE MADE YOU YOUR PORTION IS UNHAPPILY SO SMALL THAT IT WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD UNDO THE EFFECTS OF YOUR LOVELINESS AND AMIABLE QUALIFICATIONS
WITH A RENEWAL OF TENDERNESS HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO HER ROOM ON LEAVING THE DINING PARLOUR AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL TILL LATE IN THE EVENING
I CANNOT BOAST OF KNOWING MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE THAT ARE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED NOR I I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY THEN OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN
SHE DID AT LAST EXTORT FROM HER FATHER AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE HORSES WERE ENGAGED JANE WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO GO ON HORSEBACK AND HER MOTHER ATTENDED HER TO THE DOOR WITH MANY CHEERFUL PROGNOSTICS OF A BAD DAY HER HOPES WERE ANSWERED
THE NEXT DAY OPENED A NEW SCENE AT LONGBOURN MISTER COLLINS MADE HIS DECLARATION IN FORM HAVING RESOLVED TO DO IT WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME AS HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE EXTENDED ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY
THAT YOU SHOULD BE SO READY TO THINK YOUR OWN CHILDREN SILLY IF I WISHED TO THINK SLIGHTINGLY OF ANYBODY'S CHILDREN IT SHOULD NOT BE OF MY OWN HOWEVER IF MY CHILDREN ARE SILLY I MUST HOPE TO BE ALWAYS SENSIBLE OF IT
BUT IT MUST VERY MATERIALLY LESSEN THEIR CHANCE OF MARRYING MEN OF ANY CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD REPLIED DARCY TO THIS SPEECH BINGLEY MADE NO ANSWER BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS
BUT LYDIA WITH PERFECT INDIFFERENCE CONTINUED TO EXPRESS HER ADMIRATION OF CAPTAIN CARTER AND HER HOPE OF SEEING HIM IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AS HE WAS GOING THE NEXT MORNING TO LONDON I AM ASTONISHED MY DEAR SAID MISSUS BENNET
AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM HER MANNERS WERE PRONOUNCED TO BE VERY BAD INDEED A MIXTURE OF PRIDE AND IMPERTINENCE SHE HAD NO CONVERSATION NO STYLE NO BEAUTY MISSUS HURST THOUGHT THE SAME AND ADDED
A MOST COUNTRY TOWN INDIFFERENCE TO DECORUM IT SHOWS AN AFFECTION FOR HER SISTER THAT IS VERY PLEASING SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER
AS IF THE CREDIT OF MAKING IT RAIN WERE ALL HER OWN TILL THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER SHE WAS NOT AWARE OF ALL THE FELICITY OF HER CONTRIVANCE BREAKFAST WAS SCARCELY OVER WHEN A SERVANT FROM NETHERFIELD BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING NOTE FOR ELIZABETH MY DEAREST LIZZY I FIND MYSELF
DINING OUT SAID MISSUS BENNET THAT IS VERY UNLUCKY CAN I HAVE THE CARRIAGE SAID JANE NO MY DEAR YOU HAD BETTER GO ON HORSEBACK BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKELY TO RAIN AND THEN YOU MUST STAY ALL NIGHT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD SCHEME SAID ELIZABETH
WHO ARE SO DARING AS TO RISK THEIR HAPPINESS ON THE CHANCE OF BEING ASKED A SECOND TIME I AM PERFECTLY SERIOUS IN MY REFUSAL YOU COULD NOT MAKE ME HAPPY AND I AM CONVINCED THAT I AM THE LAST WOMAN IN THE WORLD WHO COULD MAKE YOU SO NAY
AND ONE OF THE YOUNGER GIRLS TOGETHER SOON AFTER BREAKFAST HE ADDRESSED THE MOTHER IN THESE WORDS MAY I HOPE MADAM FOR YOUR INTEREST WITH YOUR FAIR DAUGHTER ELIZABETH WHEN I SOLICIT FOR THE HONOUR OF A PRIVATE AUDIENCE WITH HER IN THE COURSE OF THIS MORNING
MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE I DESERVE NEITHER SUCH PRAISE NOR SUCH CENSURE CRIED ELIZABETH
IS THIS A HINT TO ME LIZZY SAID HER FATHER TO SEND FOR THE HORSES NO INDEED I DO NOT WISH TO AVOID THE WALK THE DISTANCE IS NOTHING WHEN ONE HAS A MOTIVE ONLY THREE MILES I SHALL BE BACK BY DINNER
THAT IT IS THE PARTICULAR ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE VERY NOBLE LADY WHOM I HAVE THE HONOUR OF CALLING PATRONESS TWICE HAS SHE CONDESCENDED TO GIVE ME HER OPINION
ON THE FIRST APPLICATION AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE EVEN NOW SAID AS MUCH TO ENCOURAGE MY SUIT AS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TRUE DELICACY OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER REALLY MISTER COLLINS CRIED ELIZABETH WITH SOME WARMTH YOU PUZZLE ME EXCEEDINGLY
ON THIS SUBJECT AND IT WAS BUT THE VERY SATURDAY NIGHT BEFORE I LEFT HUNSFORD BETWEEN OUR POOLS AT QUADRILLE WHILE MISSUS JENKINSON WAS ARRANGING MISS DE BOURGH'S FOOTSTOOL THAT SHE SAID MISTER COLLINS YOU MUST MARRY
NO NO NONSENSE LIZZY I DESIRE YOU TO STAY WHERE YOU ARE AND UPON ELIZABETH'S SEEMING REALLY WITH VEXED AND EMBARRASSED LOOKS ABOUT TO ESCAPE SHE ADDED LIZZY I INSIST UPON YOUR STAYING AND HEARING MISTER COLLINS
SHE SEES THEM NOW VERY OFTEN STANDING IN CLARKE'S LIBRARY MISSUS BENNET WAS PREVENTED REPLYING BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE FOOTMAN WITH A NOTE FOR MISS BENNET IT CAME FROM NETHERFIELD AND THE SERVANT WAITED FOR AN ANSWER MISSUS BENNET'S EYES SPARKLED WITH PLEASURE
ELIZABETH ASSURED HIM THAT SHE COULD SUIT HERSELF PERFECTLY WITH THOSE IN THE ROOM I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY
AND GATHERING HER WORK TOGETHER SHE WAS HASTENING AWAY WHEN ELIZABETH CALLED OUT DEAR MADAM DO NOT GO I BEG YOU WILL NOT GO MISTER COLLINS MUST EXCUSE ME HE CAN HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ME THAT ANYBODY NEED NOT HEAR I AM GOING AWAY MYSELF
AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN WHEN I HAVE THE HONOUR OF SEEING HER AGAIN I SHALL SPEAK IN THE VERY HIGHEST TERMS OF YOUR MODESTY ECONOMY AND OTHER AMIABLE QUALIFICATION INDEED MISTER COLLINS ALL PRAISE OF ME WILL BE UNNECESSARY YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO JUDGE FOR MYSELF
DO NOT CONSIDER ME NOW AS AN ELEGANT FEMALE INTENDING TO PLAGUE YOU BUT AS A RATIONAL CREATURE SPEAKING THE TRUTH FROM HER HEART YOU ARE UNIFORMLY CHARMING CRIED HE WITH AN AIR OF AWKWARD GALLANTRY
AND I THOUGHT COLONEL FORSTER LOOKED VERY BECOMING THE OTHER NIGHT AT SIR WILLIAM'S IN HIS REGIMENTALS MAMMA CRIED LYDIA MY AUNT SAYS THAT COLONEL FORSTER AND CAPTAIN CARTER DO NOT GO SO OFTEN TO MISS WATSON'S AS THEY DID WHEN THEY FIRST CAME
OF THE MOST INTERESTING INTELLIGENCE EVERY DAY ADDED SOMETHING TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE OFFICERS NAMES AND CONNECTIONS THEIR LODGINGS WERE NOT LONG A SECRET AND AT LENGTH THEY BEGAN TO KNOW THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES MISTER PHILLIPS VISITED THEM ALL
WHOM THEY SECRETLY MEAN TO ACCEPT WHEN HE FIRST APPLIES FOR THEIR FAVOUR AND THAT SOMETIMES THE REFUSAL IS REPEATED A SECOND OR EVEN A THIRD TIME I AM THEREFORE BY NO MEANS DISCOURAGED BY WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID
AND HAVING NO FEELINGS OF DIFFIDENCE TO MAKE IT DISTRESSING TO HIMSELF EVEN AT THE MOMENT HE SET ABOUT IT IN A VERY ORDERLY MANNER WITH ALL THE OBSERVANCES WHICH HE SUPPOSED A REGULAR PART OF THE BUSINESS ON FINDING MISSUS BENNET ELIZABETH
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE FOR ME TO STATE MY REASONS FOR MARRYING AND MOREOVER FOR COMING INTO HERTFORDSHIRE WITH THE DESIGN OF SELECTING A WIFE AS I CERTAINLY DID THE IDEA OF MISTER COLLINS WITH ALL HIS SOLEMN COMPOSURE
AND FINDING HERSELF AT LAST WITHIN VIEW OF THE HOUSE WITH WEARY ANKLES DIRTY STOCKINGS AND A FACE GLOWING WITH THE WARMTH OF EXERCISE SHE WAS SHOWN INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR WHERE ALL BUT JANE WERE ASSEMBLED
I THOUGHT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET LOOKED REMARKABLY WELL WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM THIS MORNING HER DIRTY PETTICOAT QUITE ESCAPED MY NOTICE YOU OBSERVED IT MISTER DARCY I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE YOUR SISTER MAKE SUCH AN EXHIBITION
THIS HAS BEEN MY MOTIVE MY FAIR COUSIN AND I FLATTER MYSELF IT WILL NOT SINK ME IN YOUR ESTEEM AND NOW NOTHING REMAINS FOR ME BUT TO ASSURE YOU IN THE MOST ANIMATED LANGUAGE OF THE VIOLENCE OF MY AFFECTION TO FORTUNE I AM PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT
SHE WILL BE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF AS LONG AS SHE STAYS THERE IT IS ALL VERY WELL I WOULD GO AND SEE HER IF I COULD HAVE THE CARRIAGE ELIZABETH FEELING REALLY ANXIOUS WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO HER THOUGH THE CARRIAGE WAS NOT TO BE HAD AND AS SHE WAS NO HORSEWOMAN
AND WHEN MISS BINGLEY LEFT THEM TOGETHER COULD ATTEMPT LITTLE BESIDES EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY KINDNESS SHE WAS TREATED WITH ELIZABETH SILENTLY ATTENDED HER WHEN BREAKFAST WAS OVER THEY WERE JOINED BY THE SISTERS
AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE
THEY WERE WELL SUPPLIED BOTH WITH NEWS AND HAPPINESS BY THE RECENT ARRIVAL OF A MILITIA REGIMENT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS TO REMAIN THE WHOLE WINTER AND MERYTON WAS THE HEADQUARTERS THEIR VISITS TO MISSUS PHILLIPS WERE NOW PRODUCTIVE
ALMOST AS SOON AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE I SINGLED YOU OUT AS THE COMPANION OF MY FUTURE LIFE
MY CONNECTIONS WITH THE FAMILY OF DE BOURGH AND MY RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR OWN ARE CIRCUMSTANCES HIGHLY IN MY FAVOUR AND YOU SHOULD TAKE IT INTO FURTHER CONSIDERATION THAT IN SPITE OF YOUR MANIFOLD ATTRACTIONS
AND THAT THEY MUST ENDEAVOUR TO GET THE BETTER OF IT ADVISED HER TO RETURN TO BED AND PROMISED HER SOME DRAUGHTS THE ADVICE WAS FOLLOWED READILY FOR THE FEVERISH SYMPTOMS INCREASED AND HER HEAD ACHED ACUTELY
AND THEN WALKED TOWARDS THE TABLE WHERE A FEW BOOKS WERE LYING HE IMMEDIATELY OFFERED TO FETCH HER OTHERS ALL THAT HIS LIBRARY AFFORDED AND I WISH MY COLLECTION WERE LARGER FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND MY OWN CREDIT BUT I AM AN IDLE FELLOW AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT MANY I HAVE MORE THAN I EVER LOOKED INTO
AND SOME CORDIAL WAS POURED INTO MY MOUTH AND SOMETHING WAS COVERED OVER ME I CANNOT TELL HOW LONG I LAY THERE BUT I FOUND MY LIFE COMING BACK AND A KIND VOICED MAN WAS PATTING ME
I HEARD NO MORE AS THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND JOHN TOOK ME TO THE STABLE OH WHAT A GOOD SUPPER HE GAVE ME THAT NIGHT A GOOD BRAN MASH AND SOME CRUSHED BEANS WITH MY OATS AND SUCH A THICK BED OF STRAW
AND IN A MOMENT I PUT MY HEAD DOWN TO MY VERY KNEES WHAT A COMFORT IT WAS THEN I TOSSED IT UP AND DOWN SEVERAL TIMES TO GET THE ACHING STIFFNESS OUT OF MY NECK
CAN YOUR HORSE DO IT OR CAN'T HE SAID THE BLUSTERING MAN
WE CALL THEM DUMB ANIMALS AND SO THEY ARE FOR THEY CANNOT TELL US HOW THEY FEEL BUT THEY DO NOT SUFFER LESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO WORDS BUT I MUST NOT DETAIN YOU NOW
BUT IS IT NOT A HEAVY LOAD SHE SAID
BUT I COULD NOT GET ON AND WAS OBLIGED CONTINUALLY TO STOP THIS DID NOT PLEASE MY DRIVER AND HE LAID HIS WHIP ON BADLY GET ON YOU LAZY FELLOW HE SAID OR I'LL MAKE YOU
THE BUYERS AND SELLERS TOO MANY OF THEM LOOKED NOT MUCH BETTER OFF THAN THE POOR BEASTS THEY WERE BARGAINING ABOUT THERE WERE POOR OLD MEN TRYING TO GET A HORSE OR A PONY FOR A FEW POUNDS
I ARCHED MY POOR THIN NECK RAISED MY TAIL A LITTLE AND THREW OUT MY LEGS AS WELL AS I COULD FOR THEY WERE VERY STIFF WHAT IS THE LOWEST YOU WILL TAKE FOR HIM
I HAVE NO MEADOWS TO NURSE SICK HORSES IN HE MIGHT GET WELL OR HE MIGHT NOT THAT SORT OF THING DON'T SUIT MY BUSINESS MY PLAN IS TO WORK EM AS LONG AS THEY'LL GO AND THEN SELL EM FOR WHAT THEY'LL FETCH
THAT I COULD HARDLY TOUCH MY FOOD HOW I USED TO LONG FOR THE NICE BRAN MASH WITH NITER IN IT THAT JERRY USED TO GIVE US ON SATURDAY NIGHTS IN HOT WEATHER
AND I MADE A DEAD STOP GO ON BEAUTY SAID MY MASTER AND HE GAVE ME A TOUCH WITH THE WHIP BUT I DARE NOT STIR HE GAVE ME A SHARP CUT I JUMPED BUT I DARE NOT GO FORWARD
BUT NOW THERE IS NOT AN OUNCE OF STRENGTH LEFT IN HIM
I NEVER KNEW TILL NOW THE UTTER MISERY OF A CAB HORSE'S LIFE SKINNER HAD A LOW SET OF CABS AND A LOW SET OF DRIVERS HE WAS HARD ON THE MEN AND THE MEN
UPON THIS ADVICE SKINNER RATHER UNWILLINGLY I THINK GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD BE WELL FED AND CARED FOR AND THE STABLE MAN HAPPILY FOR ME CARRIED OUT THE ORDERS
OF COURSE I COULD NOT TELL HIM BUT I KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE BRIDGE WAS NOT SAFE
SO MY DRIVER PULLED UP AT THE BACK OF SOME OF THE OUTSIDE CABS TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF A RETURN FARE IT WAS A VERY HEAVY TRAIN AND AS ALL THE CABS WERE SOON ENGAGED OURS WAS CALLED FOR
GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAY AND OATS EVERY NIGHT AND MORNING AND THE RUN OF THE MEADOW DURING THE DAY AND YOU WILLIE
AND HE WOULD EVEN WHIP ME UNDER THE BELLY AND FLIP THE LASH OUT AT MY HEAD INDIGNITIES LIKE THESE TOOK THE HEART OUT OF ME TERRIBLY BUT STILL I DID MY BEST
AND NEVER HUNG BACK FOR AS POOR GINGER SAID IT WAS NO USE
AND THE ROAD IS VERY STEEP I AM SURE HE IS DOING HIS BEST IF DOING HIS BEST WON'T GET THIS LOAD UP HE MUST DO SOMETHING MORE THAN HIS BEST THAT'S ALL I KNOW MA'AM SAID JAKES
THE FARMER SLOWLY FELT MY LEGS WHICH WERE MUCH SWELLED AND STRAINED THEN HE LOOKED AT MY MOUTH THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN I SHOULD SAY JUST TROT HIM OUT WILL YOU
BUT AS THAT HAPPENED SOMETIMES WHEN THE FLOODS WERE OUT MASTER DID NOT STOP WE WERE GOING ALONG AT A GOOD PACE BUT THE MOMENT MY FEET TOUCHED THE FIRST PART OF THE BRIDGE I FELT SURE THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG I DARE NOT GO FORWARD
THERE WAS A PARTY OF FOUR A NOISY BLUSTERING MAN WITH A LADY
AND BOX AFTER BOX WAS DRAGGED UP AND LODGED ON THE TOP OF THE CAB OR SETTLED BY THE SIDE OF THE DRIVER AT LAST ALL WAS READY AND WITH HIS USUAL JERK AT THE REIN AND SLASH OF THE WHIP
IT VERY MUCH WEAKENED MY SIGHT AND WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT OUT OF THE DARKNESS INTO THE GLARE OF DAYLIGHT IT WAS VERY PAINFUL TO MY EYES SEVERAL TIMES I STUMBLED OVER THE THRESHOLD AND COULD SCARCELY SEE WHERE I WAS GOING
HE WOULD ORDER SOMETHING ELSE TO BE TAKEN ON MY CARTER WHOSE NAME WAS JAKES OFTEN SAID IT WAS MORE THAN I OUGHT TO TAKE BUT THE OTHER ALWAYS OVERRULED HIM TWAS NO USE GOING TWICE WHEN ONCE WOULD DO
SOME OF THEM LOOKED AS IF POVERTY AND HARD TIMES HAD HARDENED THEM ALL OVER BUT THERE WERE OTHERS THAT I WOULD HAVE WILLINGLY USED THE LAST OF MY STRENGTH IN SERVING POOR AND SHABBY BUT KIND AND HUMAN
AND TWOULD BE WORTH A GENTLEMAN'S WHILE TO GIVE A FIVE POUND NOTE FOR HIM AND LET HIM HAVE A CHANCE I'LL BE BOUND HE'D BE WORTH TWENTY POUNDS NEXT SPRING THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED AND THE LITTLE BOY LOOKED UP EAGERLY
I WAS SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED TO BE LED BACK TO SKINNER'S STABLES WHERE I THINK THEY DID THE BEST FOR ME THEY COULD IN THE MORNING SKINNER CAME WITH A FARRIER TO LOOK AT ME HE EXAMINED ME VERY CLOSELY AND SAID
AND AS WE CAME UP MISTRESS RAN OUT SAYING ARE YOU REALLY SAFE MY DEAR OH I HAVE BEEN SO ANXIOUS
THIS IS A CASE OF OVERWORK MORE THAN DISEASE
BUT AT THE SAME TIME SLOWLY DRAWING OUT HIS PURSE QUITE A SPECULATION HAVE YOU ANY MORE BUSINESS HERE HE SAID COUNTING THE SOVEREIGNS INTO HIS HAND NO SIR
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG SIR SAID JOHN AND HE SPRANG OUT OF THE DOG CART AND CAME TO MY HEAD AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HE TRIED TO LEAD ME FORWARD COME ON BEAUTY WHAT'S THE MATTER
AND THANK YOU MA'AM BUT IF HE WENT WITHOUT A CHECK REIN I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF ALL THE CARTERS IT IS THE FASHION YOU SEE IS IT NOT BETTER SHE SAID
I HAD STILL A GOOD MANE AND TAIL WHICH DID SOMETHING FOR MY APPEARANCE I PRICKED MY EARS AND LOOKED AT HIM THERE'S A HORSE WILLIE THAT HAS KNOWN BETTER DAYS
THAT A YOUNGER HORSE WAS BOUGHT IN MY PLACE I MAY AS WELL MENTION HERE WHAT I SUFFERED AT THIS TIME FROM ANOTHER CAUSE I HAD HEARD HORSES SPEAK OF IT BUT HAD NEVER MYSELF HAD EXPERIENCE OF THE EVIL
AND HE WORE A BROAD BRIMMED HAT WHEN HE CAME UP TO ME AND MY COMPANIONS HE STOOD STILL AND GAVE A PITIFUL LOOK ROUND UPON US I SAW HIS EYE REST ON ME
SO BACK WE WENT AND ROUND BY THE CROSSROADS BUT BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE BRIDGE IT WAS VERY NEARLY DARK WE COULD JUST SEE THAT THE WATER WAS OVER THE MIDDLE OF IT
HE DROVE OUT OF THE STATION THE LOAD WAS VERY HEAVY AND I HAD HAD NEITHER FOOD NOR REST SINCE MORNING
HE WOULD SAY BUT HE IS IMPROVING SO STEADILY THAT I THINK WE SHALL SEE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER IN THE SPRING THE PERFECT REST THE GOOD FOOD THE SOFT TURF AND GENTLE EXERCISE
FEARING SOME ACCIDENT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT SHE HAD SENT JAMES OFF ON JUSTICE THE ROAN COB TOWARD THE WOODEN BRIDGE TO MAKE INQUIRY AFTER US WE SAW A LIGHT AT THE HALL DOOR AND AT THE UPPER WINDOWS
AND WAS IN A MOMENT AT MY HEAD THAT WAS A VERY NEAR TOUCH SAID MY MASTER WHAT'S TO BE DONE NOW WELL SIR WE CAN'T DRIVE OVER THAT TREE NOR YET GET ROUND IT
HOWEVER I ESCAPED WITHOUT ANY PERMANENT INJURY TO MY SIGHT
BESIDES SHE ADDED IN A VERY SERIOUS VOICE WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO DISTRESS ANY OF GOD'S CREATURES
AND AS THE CURRENT WAS FLOWING VERY STRONGLY AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT AND NO HELP AT HAND
POOR OLD FELLOW SAID THE BOY DO YOU THINK GRANDPAPA HE WAS EVER A CARRIAGE HORSE OH YES MY BOY SAID THE FARMER COMING CLOSER HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANYTHING WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
THANK GOD SAID MY MASTER YOU BEAUTY SAID JOHN AND TOOK THE BRIDLE AND GENTLY TURNED ME ROUND TO THE RIGHT HAND ROAD BY THE RIVER SIDE THE SUN HAD SET SOME TIME
AND IF MY MASTER HAD ALWAYS BEEN ON THE PREMISES I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVERLOADED BUT THERE WAS A FOREMAN WHO WAS ALWAYS HURRYING AND DRIVING EVERY ONE AND FREQUENTLY WHEN I HAD QUITE A FULL LOAD
SOON BEGAN TO TELL ON MY CONDITION AND MY SPIRITS I HAD A GOOD CONSTITUTION FROM MY MOTHER AND I WAS NEVER STRAINED WHEN I WAS YOUNG SO THAT I HAD A BETTER CHANCE THAN MANY HORSES WHO HAVE BEEN WORKED BEFORE THEY CAME TO THEIR FULL STRENGTH
AND SO I THOUGHT AS WE WENT ALONG THE SKIRTS OF A WOOD WHERE THE GREAT BRANCHES WERE SWAYING ABOUT LIKE TWIGS AND THE RUSHING SOUND WAS TERRIBLE I WISH WE WERE WELL OUT OF THIS WOOD SAID MY MASTER
BUT AS THE MASTER'S BUSINESS ENGAGED HIM A LONG TIME WE DID NOT START FOR HOME TILL RATHER LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THE WIND WAS THEN MUCH HIGHER AND I HEARD THE MASTER SAY TO JOHN THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN OUT IN SUCH A STORM
HE CALLED ME OLD CRONY AS I USED TO COME TO HIM IN THE FIELD AND FOLLOW HIM ABOUT SOMETIMES HE BROUGHT HIS GRANDFATHER WHO ALWAYS LOOKED CLOSELY AT MY LEGS THIS IS OUR POINT WILLIE
A PRETTY THING IT WOULD BE IF A MAN OF BUSINESS HAD TO EXAMINE EVERY CAB HORSE BEFORE HE HIRED IT THE MAN KNOWS HIS OWN BUSINESS OF COURSE THERE GET IN AND HOLD YOUR TONGUE MY GENTLE FRIEND HAD TO OBEY
DO SO I AM NOW GOING THERE THEY WALKED FORWARD AND I WAS LED BEHIND THE BOY COULD HARDLY CONTROL HIS DELIGHT AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEEMED TO ENJOY HIS PLEASURE I HAD A GOOD FEED AT THE INN
I GIVE HIM IN CHARGE TO YOU THE BOY WAS PROUD OF HIS CHARGE AND UNDERTOOK IT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THERE WAS NOT A DAY WHEN HE DID NOT PAY ME A VISIT SOMETIMES PICKING ME OUT FROM AMONG THE OTHER HORSES
I BELIEVE HAD I STAYED THERE VERY LONG I SHOULD HAVE BECOME PURBLIND AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR I HAVE HEARD MEN SAY THAT A STONE BLIND HORSE WAS SAFER TO DRIVE THAN ONE WHICH HAD IMPERFECT SIGHT
THE LADY HAD WALKED ALONG THE FOOTPATH AND NOW CAME ACROSS INTO THE ROAD SHE STROKED AND PATTED MY NECK AS I HAD NOT BEEN PATTED FOR MANY A LONG DAY YOU SEE HE
SAID SHE PATTING AND STROKING ME WITH HER GENTLE HAND AND NOW IF YOU WILL SPEAK KINDLY TO HIM AND LEAD HIM ON I BELIEVE HE WILL BE ABLE TO DO BETTER JAKES TOOK THE REIN COME ON BLACKIE
WERE HARD ON THE HORSES IN THIS PLACE WE HAD NO SUNDAY REST
I WAS STRUGGLING TO KEEP ON GOADED BY CONSTANT CHUCKS OF THE REIN AND USE OF THE WHIP WHEN IN A SINGLE MOMENT I CANNOT TELL HOW
AND WAS THEN GENTLY RIDDEN HOME BY A SERVANT OF MY NEW MASTER'S AND TURNED INTO A LARGE MEADOW WITH A SHED IN ONE CORNER OF IT MISTER THOROUGHGOOD FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF MY BENEFACTOR
HERE I WAS PUT INTO A WELL LITTERED STALL AND SOME WARM GRUEL WAS BROUGHT TO ME WHICH I DRANK THANKFULLY IN THE EVENING
SOMETIMES ON A SUNDAY MORNING A PARTY OF FAST MEN WOULD HIRE THE CAB FOR THE DAY FOUR OF THEM INSIDE AND ANOTHER WITH THE DRIVER AND I HAD TO TAKE THEM TEN OR FIFTEEN MILES OUT INTO THE COUNTRY AND BACK AGAIN
THIS WAS A BADLY LIGHTED STABLE THERE WAS ONLY ONE VERY SMALL WINDOW AT THE END AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE STALLS WERE ALMOST DARK BESIDES THE DEPRESSING EFFECT THIS HAD ON MY SPIRITS
JAKES AND THE LADY I WAS SOLD TO A CORN DEALER AND BAKER WHOM JERRY KNEW AND WITH HIM HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE GOOD FOOD AND FAIR WORK IN THE FIRST HE WAS QUITE RIGHT
BLESS THE BOY HE IS AS HORSEY AS HIS OLD GRANDFATHER BUT DO LOOK AT HIS MOUTH GRANDPAPA AND ASK THE PRICE I AM SURE HE WOULD GROW YOUNG IN OUR MEADOWS
HE WAS RAISING THE WHIP AGAIN WHEN THE LADY SAID
WE MUST NOW BE LOOKING OUT FOR A QUIET GENTEEL PLACE FOR HIM
THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF RAIN AND NOW THE WIND WAS VERY HIGH AND BLEW THE DRY LEAVES ACROSS THE ROAD IN A SHOWER WE WENT ALONG MERRILY TILL WE CAME TO THE TOLL BAR AND THE LOW WOODEN BRIDGE
OH HE'S ALL RIGHT MISS SAID MY DRIVER HE'S STRONG ENOUGH THE PORTER WHO WAS PULLING ABOUT SOME HEAVY BOXES SUGGESTED TO THE GENTLEMAN AS THERE WAS SO MUCH LUGGAGE
I PUT DOWN MY HEAD AND THREW MY WHOLE WEIGHT AGAINST THE COLLAR I SPARED NO STRENGTH THE LOAD MOVED ON AND I PULLED IT STEADILY UP THE HILL AND THEN STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
I TROTTED QUIETLY ALONG THE WHEELS HARDLY MAKING A SOUND ON THE SOFT ROAD FOR A GOOD WHILE NEITHER MASTER NOR JOHN SPOKE AND THEN MASTER BEGAN IN A SERIOUS VOICE
WITH VOICES THAT I COULD TRUST THERE WAS ONE TOTTERING OLD MAN WHO TOOK A GREAT FANCY TO ME AND I TO HIM BUT I WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH IT WAS AN ANXIOUS TIME
AND I MUST DO HIM THE JUSTICE TO SAY THAT HE LET MY REIN OUT SEVERAL HOLES AND GOING UPHILL AFTER THAT HE ALWAYS GAVE ME MY HEAD BUT THE HEAVY LOADS WENT ON
AT THE KNACKER'S OR ELSEWHERE
NOW I WAS GOING TO DIE I HEARD A SORT OF CONFUSION ROUND ME LOUD ANGRY VOICES AND THE GETTING DOWN OF THE LUGGAGE BUT IT WAS ALL LIKE A DREAM I THOUGHT I HEARD THAT SWEET PITIFUL VOICE SAYING
LET IT BE EVER SO STEEP OR THE DAY EVER SO HOT UNLESS INDEED WHEN THE DRIVER WAS AFRAID I SHOULD NOT MANAGE IT AND SOMETIMES I WAS SO FEVERED AND WORN
I PUT OUT MY NOSE IN ANSWER TO HIS KINDNESS THE BOY STROKED MY FACE POOR OLD FELLOW SEE GRANDPAPA HOW WELL HE UNDERSTANDS KINDNESS
I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MUCH OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT I FOUND THEY THOUGHT IF I HAD GONE ON AS THE MASTER WANTED ME MOST LIKELY THE BRIDGE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WAY UNDER US AND HORSE CHAISE MASTER
I FOUND THE WORK TELLING VERY MUCH ON MY STRENGTH ONE DAY I WAS LOADED MORE THAN USUAL AND PART OF THE ROAD WAS A STEEP UPHILL I USED ALL MY STRENGTH
AND ENCOURAGING ME TO RISE AFTER SOME MORE CORDIAL HAD BEEN GIVEN ME AND AFTER ONE OR TWO ATTEMPTS I STAGGERED TO MY FEET AND WAS GENTLY LED TO SOME STABLES WHICH WERE CLOSE BY
BUT I SHOULD SAY THAT FEELING IS BELIEVING
OH GRANDPAPA
I AM SURE HE MAKES FRIENDS OF THEM IF EVER A MAN DID AT LAST WE CAME TO THE PARK GATES AND FOUND THE GARDENER LOOKING OUT FOR US HE SAID THAT MISTRESS HAD BEEN IN A DREADFUL WAY EVER SINCE DARK
BEAUTIFUL MOUTH AND GOOD PACES THEY CAN'T BE BETTER OH GRANDPAPA HOW GLAD I AM YOU BOUGHT HIM SO AM I MY BOY BUT HE HAS TO THANK YOU MORE THAN ME
MY NEW MASTER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HE HAD BLACK EYES AND A HOOKED NOSE HIS MOUTH WAS AS FULL OF TEETH AS A BULL DOG'S AND HIS VOICE WAS AS HARSH AS THE GRINDING OF CART WHEELS
I COULD HEAR A POLICEMAN GIVING ORDERS BUT I DID NOT EVEN OPEN MY EYES I COULD ONLY DRAW A GASPING BREATH NOW AND THEN SOME COLD WATER WAS THROWN OVER MY HEAD
LOOK AT HIS MANE AND TAIL I WISH YOU WOULD LOOK INTO HIS MOUTH AND THEN YOU COULD TELL THOUGH HE IS SO VERY THIN HIS EYES ARE NOT SUNK LIKE SOME OLD HORSES THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED
AT THIS SALE OF COURSE I FOUND MYSELF IN COMPANY WITH THE OLD BROKEN DOWN HORSES SOME LAME SOME BROKEN WINDED SOME OLD AND SOME THAT I AM SURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERCIFUL TO SHOOT
THE SPRING CAME ROUND AND ONE DAY IN MARCH MISTER THOROUGHGOOD DETERMINED THAT HE WOULD TRY ME IN THE PHAETON I WAS WELL PLEASED AND HE AND WILLIE DROVE ME A FEW MILES
MY LEGS WERE NOT STIFF NOW AND I DID THE WORK WITH PERFECT EASE HE'S GROWING YOUNG WILLIE WE MUST GIVE HIM A LITTLE GENTLE WORK NOW AND BY MID SUMMER HE WILL BE AS GOOD AS LADYBIRD HE HAS A
THE WIND SEEMED TO HAVE LULLED OFF AFTER THAT FURIOUS BLAST WHICH TORE UP THE TREE IT GREW DARKER AND DARKER STILLER AND STILLER
I WILL NEVER SAY I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED FOR I WAS I STOPPED STILL AND I BELIEVE I TREMBLED OF COURSE I DID NOT TURN ROUND OR RUN AWAY I WAS NOT BROUGHT UP TO THAT JOHN JUMPED OUT
AND GIVING ME A BIT OF CARROT OR SOMETHING GOOD OR SOMETIMES STANDING BY ME WHILE I ATE MY OATS HE ALWAYS CAME WITH KIND WORDS AND CARESSES AND OF COURSE I GREW VERY FOND OF HIM
COMING FROM THE BETTER PART OF THE FAIR I NOTICED A MAN WHO LOOKED LIKE A GENTLEMAN FARMER WITH A YOUNG BOY BY HIS SIDE HE HAD A BROAD BACK AND ROUND SHOULDERS A KIND RUDDY FACE
TEN DAYS OF PERFECT REST PLENTY OF GOOD OATS HAY BRAN MASHES WITH BOILED LINSEED MIXED IN THEM DID MORE TO GET UP MY CONDITION THAN ANYTHING ELSE COULD HAVE DONE
SOME ONE CAME AND LOOSENED THE THROAT STRAP OF MY BRIDLE AND UNDID THE TRACES WHICH KEPT THE COLLAR SO TIGHT UPON ME SOME ONE SAID HE'S DEAD HE'LL NEVER GET UP AGAIN THEN
WHEN THERE WAS A GROAN AND A CRACK AND A SPLITTING SOUND AND TEARING CRASHING DOWN AMONG THE OTHER TREES CAME AN OAK TORN UP BY THE ROOTS AND IT FELL RIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD JUST BEFORE US
THOSE LINSEED MASHES WERE DELICIOUS AND I BEGAN TO THINK AFTER ALL
AGAIN I STARTED THE HEAVY LOAD AND STRUGGLED ON A FEW YARDS AGAIN THE WHIP CAME DOWN AND AGAIN I STRUGGLED FORWARD THE PAIN OF THAT GREAT CART WHIP WAS SHARP
BUT MY MIND WAS HURT QUITE AS MUCH AS MY POOR SIDES TO BE PUNISHED AND ABUSED WHEN I WAS DOING MY VERY BEST WAS SO HARD IT TOOK THE HEART OUT OF ME
TO LEAD A GOOD FASHION THAN TO FOLLOW A BAD ONE A GREAT MANY GENTLEMEN DO NOT USE CHECK REINS NOW OUR CARRIAGE HORSES HAVE NOT WORN THEM FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
THE RIVER BANKS WERE RATHER HIGH AND THE BRIDGE INSTEAD OF RISING WENT ACROSS JUST LEVEL SO THAT IN THE MIDDLE IF THE RIVER WAS FULL THE WATER WOULD BE NEARLY UP TO THE WOODWORK AND PLANKS
A THIRD TIME HE WAS FLOGGING ME CRUELLY WHEN A LADY STEPPED QUICKLY UP TO HIM AND SAID IN A SWEET EARNEST VOICE
YOU HAD BETTER HAVE HIM KILLED OUT OF HAND BUT HE IS NOT THERE IS A SALE OF HORSES COMING OFF IN ABOUT TEN DAYS IF YOU REST HIM AND FEED HIM UP HE MAY PICK UP AND YOU MAY GET MORE THAN HIS SKIN IS WORTH AT ANY RATE
THAT USED TO COOL US DOWN AND MAKE US SO COMFORTABLE THEN WE HAD TWO NIGHTS AND A WHOLE DAY FOR UNBROKEN REST AND ON MONDAY MORNING WE WERE AS FRESH AS YOUNG HORSES AGAIN
COULD NOT YOU BUY HIM AND MAKE HIM YOUNG AGAIN AS YOU DID WITH LADYBIRD MY DEAR BOY I CAN'T MAKE ALL OLD HORSES YOUNG BESIDES LADYBIRD WAS NOT SO VERY OLD AS SHE WAS RUN DOWN AND BADLY USED
HE COULD TAKE MORE THAN THAT AND HE HELPED TO HAUL UP A BOX SO HEAVY
GOOD FEED AND FAIR REST WILL KEEP UP ONE'S STRENGTH UNDER FULL WORK BUT NO HORSE CAN STAND AGAINST OVERLOADING AND I WAS GETTING SO THOROUGHLY PULLED DOWN FROM THIS CAUSE
BUT HERE THERE WAS NO REST AND MY DRIVER WAS JUST AS HARD AS HIS MASTER HE HAD A CRUEL WHIP WITH SOMETHING SO SHARP AT THE END THAT IT SOMETIMES DREW BLOOD
THE MAN LAUGHED YOU SEE SHE SAID YOU DO NOT GIVE HIM A FAIR CHANCE HE CANNOT USE ALL HIS POWER WITH HIS HEAD HELD BACK AS IT IS WITH THAT CHECK REIN
WOULD SET HIM RIGHT UP BEING AS HOW HIS WIND WAS NOT BROKEN I'VE HAD THE TENDING OF HIM THESE TEN DAYS PAST AND A GRATEFULLER PLEASANTER ANIMAL I NEVER MET WITH
HE SAID BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT THE FOREMAN CAME JUST AS WE WERE STARTING AND WOULD HAVE THREE HUNDREDWEIGHT MORE PUT ON TO SAVE HIM TROUBLE AND I MUST GET ON WITH IT AS WELL AS I CAN
SAID THE FARMER AS I CAME BACK FIVE POUNDS SIR THAT WAS THE LOWEST PRICE MY MASTER SET TIS A SPECULATION SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN SHAKING HIS HEAD
YES SIR SAID JOHN IT WOULD BE RATHER AWKWARD IF ONE OF THESE BRANCHES CAME DOWN UPON US THE WORDS WERE SCARCELY OUT OF HIS MOUTH
I THANK YOU FOR TRYING MY PLAN WITH YOUR GOOD HORSE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL FIND IT FAR BETTER THAN THE WHIP GOOD DAY AND WITH ANOTHER SOFT PAT ON MY NECK SHE STEPPED LIGHTLY ACROSS THE PATH AND I SAW HER NO MORE
THE POOR MAN IS INCAPACITATED FROM SHOWING THE VIRTUE OF GENEROSITY TO ANYONE
THAT HE HAD GOT HIS OWN HORSE DOWN TO A STRAW A DAY AND WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY HAVE RENDERED HIM A VERY SPIRITED AND RAMPACIOUS ANIMAL ON NOTHING AT ALL IF HE HAD NOT DIED FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS BEFORE HE WAS TO HAVE HAD HIS FIRST COMFORTABLE BAIT OF AIR
YOU ARE UNNATURAL CLYM AND I DID NOT EXPECT IT VERY LIKELY SAID HE CHEERLESSLY YOU DID NOT KNOW THE MEASURE YOU WERE GOING TO METE ME AND THEREFORE DID NOT KNOW THE MEASURE THAT WOULD BE RETURNED TO YOU AGAIN
FOR IF YOU WHO OUGHT TO KEEP AND LEAD THEM GO WANDERING ASTRAY WHAT WILL BECOME OF THEM
THEY CANNOT NOBODY DARES TO SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF YOU OR OF ME OH HOW I WISH I WAS SURE OF NEVER LOSING YOU THAT YOU COULD NOT BE ABLE TO DESERT ME ANYHOW CLYM STOOD SILENT A MOMENT
THE LUMINOUS RAYS WRAPPED HER UP WITH HER INCREASING DISTANCE AND THE RUSTLE OF HER DRESS OVER THE SPROUTING SEDGE AND GRASS DIED AWAY AS HE WATCHED THE DEAD FLAT OF THE SCENERY OVERPOWERED HIM
AND THE INCIPIENT MARKS OF TIME AND THOUGHT WERE LESS PERCEPTIBLE THAN WHEN HE RETURNED THE HEALTHFUL AND ENERGETIC STURDINESS WHICH WAS HIS BY NATURE HAVING PARTIALLY RECOVERED ITS ORIGINAL PROPORTIONS THEY WANDERED ONWARD TILL THEY REACHED THE NETHER MARGIN OF THE HEATH
POOR CLYM SHE CONTINUED LOOKING TENDERLY INTO HIS FACE YOU ARE SAD SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED AT YOUR HOME NEVER MIND WHAT IS LET US ONLY LOOK AT WHAT SEEMS
BUT DARLING WHAT SHALL WE DO SAID HE STILL GO ON AS WE DO NOW JUST LIVE ON FROM MEETING TO MEETING NEVER MINDING ABOUT ANOTHER DAY YOU I KNOW ARE ALWAYS THINKING OF THAT I CAN SEE YOU ARE
AND WHEN ONE HAS NOTHING MORE TO DESIRE THERE IS AN END OF IT SO LET THE COUNTY COME AND GOD HE WITH YOU
AND A DELIGHTFUL GROVE OF GREEN LEAFY TREES PRESENTS ITSELF TO THE EYES AND CHARMS THE SIGHT WITH ITS VERDURE WHILE THE EAR IS SOOTHED BY THE SWEET UNTUTORED MELODY OF THE COUNTLESS BIRDS OF GAY PLUMAGE THAT FLIT TO AND FRO AMONG THE INTERLACING BRANCHES
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL OF IT THERE WAS SOMETHING QUEER BETWEEN HER AND THOMASIN'S HUSBAND AT ONE TIME I AM AS SURE OF IT AS THAT I STAND HERE EUSTACIA HAS TOLD ME HE DID PAY HER A LITTLE ATTENTION A YEAR AGO BUT THERE'S NO HARM IN THAT
AND THEN WHEN THE REPAST IS OVER AND THE TABLES REMOVED FOR THE KNIGHT TO RECLINE IN THE CHAIR PICKING HIS TEETH PERHAPS AS USUAL AND A DAMSEL MUCH LOVELIER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS TO ENTER UNEXPECTEDLY BY THE CHAMBER DOOR AND HERSELF BY HIS SIDE
I THINK YOU WILL SAID MISSUS MANN WHO HAD NOTICED THE TONE OF THE REFUSAL AND THE GESTURE THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED IT JUST A LEETLE DROP WITH A LITTLE COLD WATER AND A LUMP OF SUGAR MISTER BUMBLE COUGHED
INFLAMING HER LEFT EYE WITH THE CORNER OF HER APRON AND NOTWITHSTANDING A OFFERED REWARD OF TEN POUND WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS INCREASED TO TWENTY POUND NOTWITHSTANDING THE MOST SUPERLATIVE AND I MAY SAY SUPERNAT'RAL EXERTIONS ON THE PART OF THIS PARISH SAID BUMBLE
HERE HE SEES A BROOK WHOSE LIMPID WATERS LIKE LIQUID CRYSTAL RIPPLE OVER FINE SANDS AND WHITE PEBBLES THAT LOOK LIKE SIFTED GOLD AND PUREST PEARLS THERE HE PERCEIVES A CUNNINGLY WROUGHT FOUNTAIN OF MANY COLOURED JASPER AND POLISHED MARBLE HERE ANOTHER OF RUSTIC FASHION
GOODNESS GRACIOUS IS THAT YOU MISTER BUMBLE SIR SAID MISSUS MANN THRUSTING HER HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW IN WELL AFFECTED ECSTASIES OF JOY SUSAN TAKE OLIVER AND THEM TWO BRATS UPSTAIRS AND WASH EM DIRECTLY
WHICH WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN THE BEADLE ON THE CHAIR AND THE COCKED HAT ON THE TABLE WILL YOU GO ALONG WITH ME OLIVER SAID MISTER BUMBLE IN A MAJESTIC VOICE OLIVER WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT HE WOULD GO ALONG WITH ANYBODY WITH GREAT READINESS
FOR I HAVE HAD ENOUGH AND ONLY WANT TO GIVE MY MIND ITS REFRESHMENT AS I SHALL BY LISTENING TO THIS GOOD FELLOW'S STORY
AH WANDERER WANDERER SPOTTY SPOTTY HOW HAVE YOU GONE LIMPING ALL THIS TIME WHAT WOLVES HAVE FRIGHTENED YOU MY DAUGHTER WON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT IS THE MATTER MY BEAUTY BUT WHAT ELSE CAN IT BE EXCEPT THAT YOU ARE A SHE AND CANNOT KEEP QUIET
AND RAISE YOUR SPIRITS SHOULD THEY BE DEPRESSED FOR MYSELF I CAN SAY THAT SINCE I HAVE BEEN A KNIGHT ERRANT I HAVE BECOME VALIANT POLITE GENEROUS WELL BRED MAGNANIMOUS COURTEOUS DAUNTLESS GENTLE PATIENT
A BEING TO FIGHT FOR SUPPORT HELP BE MALIGNED FOR
THAT WHATEVER PART OF WHATEVER HISTORY OF A KNIGHT ERRANT ONE READS IT WILL FILL THE READER WHOEVER HE BE WITH DELIGHT AND WONDER AND TAKE MY ADVICE SIR AND AS I SAID BEFORE READ THESE BOOKS
I HAVE FEARED MY BLISS SHE SAID WITH THE MEREST MOTION OF HER LIPS IT HAS BEEN TOO INTENSE AND CONSUMING THERE IS HOPE YET THERE ARE FORTY YEARS OF WORK IN ME YET AND WHY SHOULD YOU DESPAIR
TRUST ME I AM ADVISING YOU NOW TO ACT AS A SENSIBLE MAN SHOULD ONLY READ THEM AND YOU WILL SEE THE PLEASURE YOU WILL DERIVE FROM THEM FOR COME TELL ME CAN THERE BE ANYTHING MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN TO SEE AS IT WERE
THOUGH I MAY SEEM TO PUT MYSELF FORWARD WITHOUT BEING ASKED I WILL IF IT WILL NOT TIRE YOU GENTLEMEN AND YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR ATTENTION FOR A LITTLE TELL YOU A TRUE STORY WHICH WILL CONFIRM THIS GENTLEMAN'S WORD AND HE POINTED TO THE CURATE AS WELL AS MY OWN
MISSUS MANN USHERED THE BEADLE INTO A SMALL PARLOUR WITH A BRICK FLOOR PLACED A SEAT FOR HIM AND OFFICIOUSLY DEPOSITED HIS COCKED HAT AND CANE ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM MISTER BUMBLE WIPED FROM HIS FOREHEAD THE PERSPIRATION WHICH HIS WALK HAD ENGENDERED
AT THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DELIBERATE LIES OF THE BOOKS HE READ HAD MADE UPON HIM AND LASTLY HE MARVELLED AT THE SIMPLICITY OF SANCHO WHO DESIRED SO EAGERLY TO OBTAIN THE COUNTY HIS MASTER HAD PROMISED HIM BY THIS TIME THE CANON'S SERVANTS
I MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED YOU IF YOU HAD KEPT YOURSELF FREE FROM ENTANGLEMENTS BUT THIS WOMAN IF SHE HAD BEEN A GOOD GIRL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BAD ENOUGH BUT BEING SHE IS A GOOD GIRL SO YOU THINK A CORFU BANDMASTER'S DAUGHTER
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY OF THE FEMALE TO WHOSE PROTECTING CARE OLIVER TWIST WAS DELIVERED OVER A SIMILAR RESULT USUALLY ATTENDED THE OPERATION OF HER SYSTEM
AFTER PARTICIPATING WITH HIM IN A SOUND THRASHING HAD BEEN LOCKED UP FOR ATROCIOUSLY PRESUMING TO BE HUNGRY WHEN MISSUS MANN THE GOOD LADY OF THE HOUSE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY STARTLED BY THE APPARITION OF MISTER BUMBLE THE BEADLE STRIVING TO UNDO THE WICKET OF THE GARDEN GATE
WHERE IS MISSUS YEOBRIGHT SHE HAS NOT COME HE REPLIED IN A SUBDUED TONE I WISH I HAD KNOWN THAT YOU WOULD BE HERE ALONE SHE SAID SERIOUSLY AND THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SUCH AN IDLE PLEASANT TIME AS THIS
RETURNED SANCHO PANZA ALL I KNOW IS I WOULD I HAD THE COUNTY AS SOON AS I SHALL KNOW HOW TO GOVERN IT
FOR AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE CHILD HAD CONTRIVED TO EXIST UPON THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE PORTION OF THE WEAKEST POSSIBLE FOOD IT DID PERVERSELY HAPPEN IN EIGHT AND A HALF CASES OUT OF TEN EITHER THAT IT SICKENED FROM WANT AND COLD OR FELL INTO THE FIRE FROM NEGLECT
IF THOU WOULDST WIN THE PRIZE THAT LIES HIDDEN BENEATH THESE DUSKY WAVES PROVE THE VALOUR OF THY STOUT HEART AND CAST THYSELF INTO THE MIDST OF ITS DARK BURNING WATERS
FOR I PROMISE YOU THERE WILL BE NO WANT OF CAPACITY IN ME TO GOVERN IT AND EVEN IF THERE IS I HAVE HEARD SAY THERE ARE MEN IN THE WORLD WHO FARM SEIGNIORIES PAYING SO MUCH A YEAR AND THEY THEMSELVES TAKING CHARGE OF THE GOVERNMENT WHILE THE LORD WITH HIS LEGS STRETCHED OUT ENJOYS THE REVENUE THEY PAY HIM
AND GRATITUDE THAT CONSISTS OF DISPOSITION ONLY IS A DEAD THING JUST AS FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD FOR THIS REASON I SHOULD BE GLAD WERE FORTUNE SOON TO OFFER ME SOME OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING MYSELF AN EMPEROR SO AS TO SHOW MY HEART IN DOING GOOD TO MY FRIENDS
STRETCHED OUT IN FLATS BENEATH A SKY OF PALE SOFT GREEN ALL DARK OBJECTS ON THE EARTH THAT LAY TOWARDS THE SUN WERE OVERSPREAD BY A PURPLE HAZE AGAINST WHICH GROUPS OF WAILING GNATS SHONE OUT
THAT IS THOSE WHO HAVE HAD NO PRELIMINARY TRAINING MY PLAN IS ONE FOR INSTILLING HIGH KNOWLEDGE INTO EMPTY MINDS WITHOUT FIRST CRAMMING THEM WITH WHAT HAS TO BE UNCRAMMED AGAIN BEFORE TRUE STUDY BEGINS
IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY SYSTEM LEFT TO BE INVENTED THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT OUT AT THE UNIVERSITIES LONG BEFORE THIS TIME NEVER MOTHER THEY CANNOT FIND IT OUT BECAUSE THEIR TEACHERS DON'T COME IN CONTACT WITH THE CLASS WHICH DEMANDS SUCH A SYSTEM
THEY STOOD STILL AND PREPARED TO BID EACH OTHER FAREWELL EVERYTHING BEFORE THEM WAS ON A PERFECT LEVEL THE SUN RESTING ON THE HORIZON LINE STREAMED ACROSS THE GROUND FROM BETWEEN COPPER COLOURED AND LILAC CLOUDS
AND AFTER HAVING SEEN ALL THIS WHAT CAN BE MORE CHARMING THAN TO SEE HOW A BEVY OF DAMSELS COMES FORTH FROM THE GATE OF THE CASTLE IN GAY AND GORGEOUS ATTIRE SUCH THAT WERE I TO SET MYSELF NOW TO DEPICT IT AS THE HISTORIES DESCRIBE IT TO US I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
TO THIS DON QUIXOTE REPLIED
WITH A GOATHERD AFTER IT CALLING TO IT AND UTTERING THE USUAL CRIES TO MAKE IT STOP OR TURN BACK TO THE FOLD THE FUGITIVE GOAT SCARED AND FRIGHTENED RAN TOWARDS THE COMPANY AS IF SEEKING THEIR PROTECTION AND THEN STOOD STILL
I HAVE BEEN TOLD AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE THING SHE SAID MOURNFULLY THE CAPTAIN HAS LET OUT AT THE WOMAN THAT YOU AND EUSTACIA VYE ARE ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED WE ARE SAID YEOBRIGHT BUT IT MAY NOT BE YET FOR A VERY LONG TIME
AND THEN BESTOWED UPON IT A KICK WHICH COULD HAVE EMANATED FROM NO LEG BUT A BEADLE'S LOR ONLY THINK SAID MISSUS MANN RUNNING OUT FOR THE THREE BOYS HAD BEEN REMOVED BY THIS TIME
I DRINK YOUR HEALTH WITH CHEERFULNESS MISSUS MANN AND HE SWALLOWED HALF OF IT AND NOW ABOUT BUSINESS SAID THE BEADLE TAKING OUT A LEATHERN POCKET BOOK THE CHILD THAT WAS HALF BAPTIZED OLIVER TWIST IS NINE YEAR OLD TO DAY
TO KEEP THE PARISH OFFICERS A WAITING AT YOUR GARDEN GATE WHEN THEY COME HERE UPON POROCHIAL BUSINESS WITH THE POROCHIAL ORPHANS ARE YOU AWEER MISSUS MANN THAT YOU ARE AS I MAY SAY A POROCHIAL DELEGATE AND A STIPENDIARY I'M SURE MISTER BUMBLE
HERE NOW DISPLAYED BEFORE US A VAST LAKE OF BUBBLING PITCH WITH A HOST OF SNAKES AND SERPENTS AND LIZARDS AND FEROCIOUS AND TERRIBLE CREATURES OF ALL SORTS SWIMMING ABOUT IN IT WHILE FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE THERE COMES A PLAINTIVE VOICE SAYING
WHO PLUNGED INTO THE BOILING LAKE BY THE HAND AND WITHOUT ADDRESSING A WORD TO HIM LEADS HIM INTO THE RICH PALACE OR CASTLE AND STRIPS HIM AS NAKED AS WHEN HIS MOTHER BORE HIM AND BATHES HIM IN LUKEWARM WATER AND ANOINTS HIM ALL OVER WITH SWEET SMELLING UNGUENTS
THE SUN SLOPING DOWN ON THEIR RIGHT AND THROWING THEIR THIN SPECTRAL SHADOWS TALL AS POPLAR TREES FAR OUT ACROSS THE FURZE AND FERN
AND I SHALL BE AS MUCH KING OF MY REALM AS ANY OTHER OF HIS AND BEING SO I SHOULD DO AS I LIKED AND DOING AS I LIKED I SHOULD PLEASE MYSELF AND PLEASING MYSELF I SHOULD BE CONTENT
EVIDENTLY GRATIFIED WITH THE COMPLIMENT PERHAPS I MAY BE PERHAPS I MAY BE MISSUS MANN HE FINISHED THE GIN AND WATER AND ADDED OLIVER BEING NOW TOO OLD TO REMAIN HERE THE BOARD HAVE DETERMINED TO HAVE HIM BACK INTO THE HOUSE
YOU HAVE COME ONLY TO DISTRESS ME A LONELY WOMAN AND SHORTEN MY DAYS I WISH THAT YOU WOULD BESTOW YOUR PRESENCE WHERE YOU BESTOW YOUR LOVE CLYM SAID HUSKILY YOU ARE MY MOTHER I WILL SAY NO MORE BEYOND THIS
BUT FOR ALL THAT THERE IS A GOOD DEAL TO BE SAID ON THIS MATTER OF COUNTIES TO WHICH DON QUIXOTE RETURNED I KNOW NOT WHAT MORE THERE IS TO BE SAID I ONLY GUIDE MYSELF BY THE EXAMPLE SET ME
HAVING HAD BY THIS TIME AS MUCH OF THE OUTER COAT OF DIRT WHICH ENCRUSTED HIS FACE AND HANDS REMOVED AS COULD BE SCRUBBED OFF IN ONE WASHING WAS LED INTO THE ROOM BY HIS BENEVOLENT PROTECTRESS MAKE A BOW TO THE GENTLEMAN OLIVER SAID MISSUS MANN OLIVER MADE A BOW
BUT YOU MUST NOT WILL YOU DEAR CLYM YOU ARE JUST LIKE ALL WOMEN THEY ARE EVER CONTENT TO BUILD THEIR LIVES ON ANY INCIDENTAL POSITION THAT OFFERS ITSELF WHILST MEN WOULD FAIN MAKE A GLOBE TO SUIT THEM
YOU WILL TAKE HER TO PARIS I SUPPOSE SHE SPOKE WITH WEARY HOPELESSNESS
SANCHO PARTLY HEARD THESE LAST WORDS OF HIS MASTER AND SAID TO HIM STRIVE HARD YOU SENOR DON QUIXOTE TO GIVE ME THAT COUNTY SO OFTEN PROMISED BY YOU AND SO LONG LOOKED FOR BY ME
WOULD YOUR GRANDFATHER ALLOW YOU I THINK HE WOULD ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT SHOULD NOT LAST LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS I WILL GUARANTEE THAT IF NO MISFORTUNE HAPPENS IF NO MISFORTUNE HAPPENS
MINGLED WITH FRAGMENTS OF GLITTERING CRYSTAL AND MOCK EMERALDS MAKE UP A WORK OF VARIED ASPECT WHERE ART
RISING UPWARDS AND DANCING ABOUT LIKE SPARKS OF FIRE O
REPLIED MISSUS MANN AS SHE OPENED A CORNER CUPBOARD AND TOOK DOWN A BOTTLE AND GLASS IT'S GIN I'LL NOT DECEIVE YOU MISTER B IT'S GIN DO YOU GIVE THE CHILDREN DAFFY MISSUS MANN INQUIRED BUMBLE FOLLOWING WITH HIS EYES THE INTERESTING PROCESS OF MIXING
AND IF THE MAN IS NOT WELL FILLED OR HIS ALFORJAS WELL STORED THERE HE MAY STAY AS VERY OFTEN HE DOES TURNED INTO A DRIED MUMMY THOU ART IN THE RIGHT OF IT SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE GO WHERE THOU WILT AND EAT ALL THOU CANST
AND HERE CAPACITY AND SOUND JUDGMENT COME IN AND ABOVE ALL A FIRM DETERMINATION TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH FOR IF THIS BE WANTING IN THE BEGINNING THE MIDDLE AND THE END WILL ALWAYS GO WRONG AND GOD AS COMMONLY AIDS THE HONEST INTENTIONS OF THE SIMPLE AS HE FRUSTRATES THE EVIL DESIGNS OF THE CRAFTY
AND THE NEXT VILKINS I HAVE GOT NAMES READY MADE TO THE END OF THE ALPHABET AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT AGAIN WHEN WE COME TO Z WHY YOU'RE QUITE A LITERARY CHARACTER SIR SAID MISSUS MANN WELL WELL SAID THE BEADLE
GLANCED COMPLACENTLY AT THE COCKED HAT AND SMILED YES HE SMILED BEADLES ARE BUT MEN AND MISTER BUMBLE SMILED NOW DON'T YOU BE OFFENDED AT WHAT I'M A GOING TO SAY OBSERVED MISSUS MANN WITH CAPTIVATING SWEETNESS
THE BEADLE DREW HIMSELF UP WITH GREAT PRIDE AND SAID
THANKS TO THE SPARE DIET OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AND PERHAPS TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE MAY BE ATTRIBUTED HIS HAVING ANY NINTH BIRTH DAY AT ALL BE THIS AS IT MAY HOWEVER IT WAS HIS NINTH BIRTHDAY AND HE WAS KEEPING IT IN THE COAL CELLAR WITH A SELECT PARTY OF TWO OTHER YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO
FROM THE HIGH INTELLIGENCE THEY POSSESS AND THEIR LOVE OF CURIOUS NOVELTIES THAT INTEREST CHARM AND ENTERTAIN THE MIND AS I FEEL QUITE SURE YOUR STORY WILL DO SO BEGIN FRIEND FOR WE ARE ALL PREPARED TO LISTEN I DRAW MY STAKES SAID SANCHO
THERE IS NO CHANCE OF GETTING RICH BUT WITH MY SYSTEM OF EDUCATION WHICH IS AS NEW AS IT IS TRUE I SHALL DO A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD TO MY FELLOW CREATURES DREAMS DREAMS
AND WILL RETREAT WITH THIS PASTY TO THE BROOK THERE
PLEASURE NOT KNOWN BEFOREHAND IS HALF WASTED TO ANTICIPATE IT IS TO DOUBLE IT I HAVE NOT THOUGHT ONCE TODAY OF HAVING YOU ALL TO MYSELF THIS AFTERNOON AND THE ACTUAL MOMENT OF A THING IS SO SOON GONE IT IS INDEED
SO SHE APPROPRIATED THE GREATER PART OF THE WEEKLY STIPEND TO HER OWN USE AND CONSIGNED THE RISING PAROCHIAL GENERATION TO EVEN A SHORTER ALLOWANCE THAN WAS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED FOR THEM THEREBY FINDING IN THE LOWEST DEPTH A DEEPER STILL
IN THE MINOR VALLEYS BETWEEN THE HILLOCKS WHICH DIVERSIFIED THE CONTOUR OF THE VALE THE FRESH YOUNG FERNS WERE LUXURIANTLY GROWING UP ULTIMATELY TO REACH A HEIGHT OF FIVE OR SIX FEET HE DESCENDED A LITTLE WAY
I AM ONLY AT AN AWKWARD TURNING I WISH PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE SO READY TO THINK THAT THERE IS NO PROGRESS WITHOUT UNIFORMITY AH YOUR MIND RUNS OFF TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL SIDE OF IT WELL
FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN IN A SPOT WHERE A PATH EMERGED FROM ONE OF THE SMALL HOLLOWS AND WAITED HITHER IT WAS THAT HE HAD PROMISED EUSTACIA TO BRING HIS MOTHER THIS AFTERNOON THAT THEY MIGHT MEET AND BE FRIENDS HIS ATTEMPT HAD UTTERLY FAILED
ELSE THOU SHALT NOT BE WORTHY TO SEE THE MIGHTY WONDERS CONTAINED IN THE SEVEN CASTLES OF THE SEVEN FAYS THAT LIE BENEATH THIS BLACK EXPANSE AND THEN THE KNIGHT ALMOST ERE THE AWFUL VOICE HAS CEASED WITHOUT STOPPING TO CONSIDER
OR GOT HALF SMOTHERED BY ACCIDENT IN ANY ONE OF WHICH CASES THE MISERABLE LITTLE BEING WAS USUALLY SUMMONED INTO ANOTHER WORLD AND THERE GATHERED TO THE FATHERS IT HAD NEVER KNOWN IN THIS OCCASIONALLY
AS THEY WERE EATING THEY SUDDENLY HEARD A LOUD NOISE AND THE SOUND OF A BELL THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM AMONG SOME BRAMBLES AND THICK BUSHES THAT WERE CLOSE BY AND THE SAME INSTANT THEY OBSERVED A BEAUTIFUL GOAT SPOTTED ALL OVER BLACK WHITE AND BROWN SPRING OUT OF THE THICKET
CHAPTER TWO TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH EDUCATION AND BOARD FOR THE NEXT EIGHT OR TEN MONTHS OLIVER WAS THE VICTIM OF A SYSTEMATIC COURSE OF TREACHERY AND DECEPTION
I KNEW SHE WAS SURE TO COME SHE VANISHED IN A HOLLOW FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN HER WHOLE FORM UNFOLDED ITSELF FROM THE BRAKE ONLY YOU HERE SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A DISAPPOINTED AIR WHOSE HOLLOWNESS WAS PROVED BY HER RISING REDNESS AND HER HALF GUILTY LOW LAUGH
IF NONSENSE BE CAPABLE OF METHOD THAT DON QUIXOTE UTTERED
OLIVER TWIST'S NINTH BIRTHDAY FOUND HIM A PALE THIN CHILD SOMEWHAT DIMINUTIVE IN STATURE AND DECIDEDLY SMALL IN CIRCUMFERENCE BUT NATURE OR INHERITANCE HAD IMPLANTED A GOOD STURDY SPIRIT IN OLIVER'S BREAST IT HAD HAD PLENTY OF ROOM TO EXPAND
WITHOUT PAUSING TO REFLECT UPON THE DANGER TO WHICH HE IS EXPOSING HIMSELF
THEY LEAD HIM TO ANOTHER CHAMBER WHERE HE FINDS THE TABLES SET OUT IN SUCH STYLE THAT HE IS FILLED WITH AMAZEMENT AND WONDER TO SEE HOW THEY POUR OUT WATER FOR HIS HANDS DISTILLED FROM AMBER AND SWEET SCENTED FLOWERS HOW THEY SEAT HIM ON AN IVORY CHAIR
AH BLESS EM THAT I DO DEAR AS IT IS REPLIED THE NURSE I COULDN'T SEE EM SUFFER BEFORE MY VERY EYES YOU KNOW SIR NO SAID MISTER BUMBLE APPROVINGLY NO YOU COULD NOT YOU ARE A HUMANE WOMAN MISSUS MANN
I HAVE COME OUT MYSELF TO TAKE HIM THERE SO LET ME SEE HIM AT ONCE I'LL FETCH HIM DIRECTLY SAID MISSUS MANN LEAVING THE ROOM FOR THAT PURPOSE OLIVER
WHERE TWENTY OR THIRTY OTHER JUVENILE OFFENDERS AGAINST THE POOR LAWS ROLLED ABOUT THE FLOOR ALL DAY WITHOUT THE INCONVENIENCE OF TOO MUCH FOOD OR TOO MUCH CLOTHING UNDER THE PARENTAL SUPERINTENDENCE OF AN ELDERLY FEMALE
WHEN THERE WAS SOME MORE THAN USUALLY INTERESTING INQUEST UPON A PARISH CHILD WHO HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED IN TURNING UP A BEDSTEAD OR INADVERTENTLY SCALDED TO DEATH WHEN THERE HAPPENED TO BE A WASHING THOUGH THE LATTER ACCIDENT WAS VERY SCARCE ANYTHING APPROACHING TO A WASHING BEING OF RARE OCCURRENCE IN THE FARM
YOU GIVE UP YOUR WHOLE THOUGHT YOU SET YOUR WHOLE SOUL TO PLEASE A WOMAN I DO AND THAT WOMAN IS YOU HOW CAN YOU TREAT ME SO FLIPPANTLY SAID HIS MOTHER TURNING AGAIN TO HIM WITH A TEARFUL LOOK
SHE REPEATED SLOWLY WHICH IS NOT LIKELY DEAREST FIX THE EXACT DAY AND THEN THEY CONSULTED ON THE QUESTION AND THE DAY WAS CHOSEN IT WAS TO BE A FORTNIGHT FROM THAT TIME
UPON THIS THE PARISH AUTHORITIES MAGNANIMOUSLY AND HUMANELY RESOLVED THAT OLIVER SHOULD BE FARMED OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT HE SHOULD BE DISPATCHED TO A BRANCH WORKHOUSE SOME THREE MILES OFF
AND ALWAYS SENT THE BEADLE THE DAY BEFORE TO SAY THEY WERE GOING THE CHILDREN WERE NEAT AND CLEAN TO BEHOLD WHEN THEY WENT AND WHAT MORE WOULD THE PEOPLE HAVE IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT THIS SYSTEM OF FARMING WOULD PRODUCE ANY VERY EXTRAORDINARY OR LUXURIANT CROP
THE AIR WAS WARM WITH A VAPOROUS WARMTH AND THE STILLNESS WAS UNBROKEN
FOR BEING A FEMALE AS YOU SAY SHE WILL FOLLOW HER NATURAL INSTINCT IN SPITE OF ALL YOU CAN DO TO PREVENT IT TAKE THIS MORSEL AND DRINK A SUP AND THAT WILL SOOTHE YOUR IRRITATION AND IN THE MEANTIME THE GOAT WILL REST HERSELF AND SO SAYING
WHETHER THERE WAS NO FEMALE THEN DOMICILED IN THE HOUSE WHO WAS IN A SITUATION TO IMPART TO OLIVER TWIST THE CONSOLATION AND NOURISHMENT OF WHICH HE STOOD IN NEED THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES REPLIED WITH HUMILITY THAT THERE WAS NOT
WHEN HE MADE HIS SQUIRE COUNT OF THE INSULA FIRME AND SO WITHOUT ANY SCRUPLES OF CONSCIENCE I CAN MAKE A COUNT OF SANCHO PANZA FOR HE IS ONE OF THE BEST SQUIRES THAT EVER KNIGHT ERRANT HAD THE CANON WAS ASTONISHED AT THE METHODICAL NONSENSE
ALTHOUGH THIS INVITATION WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH A CURTSEY THAT MIGHT HAVE SOFTENED THE HEART OF A CHURCH WARDEN IT BY NO MEANS MOLLIFIED THE BEADLE DO YOU THINK THIS RESPECTFUL OR PROPER CONDUCT MISSUS MANN INQUIRED MISTER BUMBLE GRASPING HIS CANE
AND BEGIN TO TELL HIM WHAT THE CASTLE IS AND HOW SHE IS HELD ENCHANTED THERE AND OTHER THINGS THAT AMAZE THE KNIGHT AND ASTONISH THE READERS WHO ARE PERUSING HIS HISTORY BUT I WILL NOT EXPATIATE ANY FURTHER UPON THIS AS IT MAY BE GATHERED FROM IT
HE WAS BROUGHT UP BY HAND THE HUNGRY AND DESTITUTE SITUATION OF THE INFANT ORPHAN WAS DULY REPORTED BY THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES TO THE PARISH AUTHORITIES THE PARISH AUTHORITIES INQUIRED WITH DIGNITY OF THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN ITS OPPRESSIVE HORIZONTALITY WHICH TOO MUCH REMINDED HIM OF THE ARENA OF LIFE IT GAVE HIM A SENSE OF BARE EQUALITY WITH AND NO SUPERIORITY TO A SINGLE LIVING THING UNDER THE SUN
YOU ANSWER ME YOU THINK ONLY OF HER YOU STICK TO HER IN ALL THINGS THAT PROVES HER TO BE WORTHY I HAVE NEVER YET SUPPORTED WHAT IS BAD AND I DO NOT CARE ONLY FOR HER I CARE FOR YOU
THE FORMER OF WHOM HAD ALWAYS OPENED THE BODY AND FOUND NOTHING INSIDE WHICH WAS VERY PROBABLE INDEED AND THE LATTER OF WHOM INVARIABLY SWORE WHATEVER THE PARISH WANTED WHICH WAS VERY SELF DEVOTIONAL BESIDES THE BOARD MADE PERIODICAL PILGRIMAGES TO THE FARM
IF IF WE CAN WE CERTAINLY CAN BOTH BEING OF FULL AGE AND I HAVE NOT FOLLOWED MY OCCUPATION ALL THESE YEARS WITHOUT HAVING ACCUMULATED MONEY AND IF YOU WILL AGREE TO LIVE IN A TINY COTTAGE SOMEWHERE ON THE HEATH
AND NOT STAND HAGGLING OVER TRIFLES BUT WASH MY HANDS AT ONCE OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND ENJOY MY RENTS LIKE A DUKE AND LET THINGS GO THEIR OWN WAY THAT BROTHER SANCHO SAID THE CANON ONLY HOLDS GOOD AS FAR AS THE ENJOYMENT OF THE REVENUE GOES
GLOOMILY PONDERING HE DISCERNED ABOVE THE FERNS A DRAWN BONNET OF WHITE SILK APPROACHING FROM THE LEFT AND YEOBRIGHT KNEW DIRECTLY THAT IT COVERED THE HEAD OF HER HE LOVED HIS HEART AWOKE FROM ITS APATHY TO A WARM EXCITEMENT AND JUMPING TO HIS FEET HE SAID ALOUD
HE HANDED HIM THE LOINS OF A COLD RABBIT ON A FORK THE GOATHERD TOOK IT WITH THANKS AND DRANK AND CALMED HIMSELF AND THEN SAID
HE WAS IN A NEST OF VIVID GREEN THE FERNY VEGETATION ROUND HIM THOUGH SO ABUNDANT WAS QUITE UNIFORM IT WAS A GROVE OF MACHINE MADE FOLIAGE A WORLD OF GREEN TRIANGLES WITH SAW EDGES AND NOT A SINGLE FLOWER
WELL WELL MISSUS MANN HE REPLIED IN A CALMER TONE IT MAY BE AS YOU SAY IT MAY BE LEAD THE WAY IN MISSUS MANN FOR I COME ON BUSINESS AND HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
YOU'VE HAD A LONG WALK YOU KNOW OR I WOULDN'T MENTION IT NOW WILL YOU TAKE A LITTLE DROP OF SOMETHINK MISTER BUMBLE NOT A DROP NOR A DROP SAID MISTER BUMBLE WAVING HIS RIGHT HAND IN A DIGNIFIED BUT PLACID MANNER
PARTICULARLY TO THIS POOR SANCHO PANZA MY SQUIRE WHO IS THE BEST FELLOW IN THE WORLD AND I WOULD GLADLY GIVE HIM A COUNTY I HAVE PROMISED HIM THIS EVER SO LONG
MY HEART ALIVE MISTER BUMBLE HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU SURE LY NOW MISTER BUMBLE WAS A FAT MAN AND A CHOLERIC SO INSTEAD OF RESPONDING TO THIS OPEN HEARTED SALUTATION IN A KINDRED SPIRIT HE GAVE THE LITTLE WICKET A TREMENDOUS SHAKE
CLYM TOOK THE HAND WHICH WAS ALREADY BARED FOR HIM IT WAS A FAVOURITE WAY WITH THEM TO WALK BARE HAND IN BARE HAND AND LED HER THROUGH THE FERNS THEY FORMED A VERY COMELY PICTURE OF LOVE AT FULL FLUSH AS THEY WALKED ALONG THE VALLEY THAT LATE AFTERNOON
AND FORTUNE THWART ME NOT TO SEE MYSELF KING OF SOME KINGDOM
THEN SHE REPLIED BEST IS IT BEST FOR YOU TO INJURE YOUR PROSPECTS FOR SUCH A VOLUPTUOUS IDLE WOMAN AS THAT DON'T YOU SEE THAT BY THE VERY FACT OF YOUR CHOOSING HER YOU PROVE THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU
THEY CALL HIM CAPTAIN BUT ANYBODY IS CAPTAIN HE WAS IN THE ROYAL NAVY NO DOUBT HE HAS BEEN TO SEA IN SOME TUB OR OTHER WHY DOESN'T HE LOOK AFTER HER
THAT I CANNOT IN ANY DEGREE APPROVE OF THOSE RESTLESS AND BUSY MEDDLERS WHO CALLED NEITHER BY BIRTH NOR FORTUNE TO TAKE PART IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS ARE YET ALWAYS PROJECTING REFORMS
PROVIDED I TOOK THE FIRM AND UNWAVERING RESOLUTION NEVER IN A SINGLE INSTANCE TO FAIL IN OBSERVING THEM THE FIRST WAS NEVER TO ACCEPT ANYTHING FOR TRUE
PERCEIVING FURTHER THAT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THESE RELATIONS I SHOULD SOMETIMES HAVE TO CONSIDER THEM ONE BY ONE AND SOMETIMES ONLY TO BEAR THEM IN MIND OR EMBRACE THEM IN THE AGGREGATE
BUT TO USE IT IN HIS BEHALF O SISTER WOMAN THINK OF ME AS A WIFE AND MOTHER
WHO HAD LEFT HER IN EXACTLY THE SAME ATTITUDE SOME SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO IT IS SHE OBSERVED HER HUSBAND DOES MADAME GO WITH US INQUIRED MISTER LORRY SEEING THAT SHE MOVED AS THEY MOVED
AND HAD WE ALWAYS BEEN GUIDED BY IT ALONE IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO PULL DOWN ALL THE HOUSES OF A TOWN WITH THE SINGLE DESIGN OF REBUILDING THEM DIFFERENTLY
I HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE OBJECTS WITH WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO COMMENCE FOR I WAS ALREADY PERSUADED THAT IT MUST BE WITH THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW AND CONSIDERING THAT OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE HITHERTO SOUGHT
SO THAT A STATE IS BEST GOVERNED WHEN WITH FEW LAWS THESE ARE RIGIDLY ADMINISTERED IN LIKE MANNER INSTEAD OF THE GREAT NUMBER OF PRECEPTS OF WHICH LOGIC IS COMPOSED I BELIEVED THAT THE FOUR FOLLOWING WOULD PROVE PERFECTLY SUFFICIENT FOR ME
I SHOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BELONGED TO THE LATTER CLASS HAD I RECEIVED INSTRUCTION FROM BUT ONE MASTER OR HAD I NEVER KNOWN THE DIVERSITIES OF OPINION THAT FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL HAVE PREVAILED AMONG MEN OF THE GREATEST LEARNING
TO THE CONSIDERATION OF FIGURES THAT IT CAN EXERCISE THE UNDERSTANDING ONLY ON CONDITION OF GREATLY FATIGUING THE IMAGINATION AND IN THE LATTER THERE IS SO COMPLETE A SUBJECTION TO CERTAIN RULES AND FORMULAS
ONE IS DISPOSED TO ALLEGE THAT CHANCE RATHER THAN ANY HUMAN WILL GUIDED BY REASON MUST HAVE LED TO SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT AND IF WE CONSIDER THAT NEVERTHELESS THERE HAVE BEEN AT ALL TIMES CERTAIN OFFICERS
OR CAPABLE OF BEING MORE DISTINCTLY REPRESENTED TO MY IMAGINATION AND SENSES AND ON THE OTHER HAND THAT IN ORDER TO RETAIN THEM IN THE MEMORY OR EMBRACE AN AGGREGATE OF MANY I SHOULD EXPRESS THEM BY CERTAIN CHARACTERS
JUDGE YOU IS IT LIKELY THAT THE TROUBLE OF ONE WIFE AND MOTHER WOULD BE MUCH TO US NOW SHE RESUMED HER KNITTING AND WENT OUT THE VENGEANCE FOLLOWED
RESULTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I COMMENCED WITH THE SIMPLEST AND MOST GENERAL TRUTHS AND THAT THUS EACH TRUTH DISCOVERED WAS A RULE AVAILABLE IN THE DISCOVERY OF SUBSEQUENT ONES
WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF MEN OF THIS CLASS ONCE TAKE THE LIBERTY TO DOUBT OF THEIR ACCUSTOMED OPINIONS AND QUIT THE BEATEN HIGHWAY THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO THREAD THE BYWAY THAT WOULD LEAD THEM BY A SHORTER COURSE
I HAVE NEVER CONTEMPLATED ANYTHING HIGHER THAN THE REFORMATION OF MY OWN OPINIONS AND BASING THEM ON A FOUNDATION WHOLLY MY OWN AND ALTHOUGH MY OWN SATISFACTION WITH MY WORK HAS LED ME TO PRESENT HERE A DRAFT OF IT
TUT TUT SAID MISTER LORRY
IS AN ENGLISH LADY AND KNOWS NO FRENCH THE LADY IN QUESTION WHOSE ROOTED CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR ANY FOREIGNER WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN BY DISTRESS AND DANGER APPEARED WITH FOLDED ARMS AND OBSERVED IN ENGLISH
YES I COME FROM DOCTOR MANETTE AND WHAT SAYS HE WHAT DOES HE SEND ME
AND HE THOUGHT OF FINDING OUT THE WINE SHOP AGAIN AND TAKING COUNSEL WITH ITS MASTER IN REFERENCE TO THE SAFEST DWELLING PLACE IN THE DISTRACTED STATE OF THE CITY BUT THE SAME CONSIDERATION THAT SUGGESTED HIM
AND THEY WENT DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD THERE THEY FOUND TWO WOMEN ONE KNITTING
WHOSE OPINIONS ARE DECIDEDLY REPUGNANT TO OURS ARE NOT IN THAT ACCOUNT BARBARIANS AND SAVAGES BUT ON THE CONTRARY THAT MANY OF THESE NATIONS MAKE AN EQUALLY GOOD IF NOT BETTER USE OF THEIR REASON THAN WE DO
THAT WE CANNOT DISCOVER IT PROVIDED ONLY WE ABSTAIN FROM ACCEPTING THE FALSE FOR THE TRUE AND ALWAYS PRESERVE IN OUR THOUGHTS THE ORDER NECESSARY FOR THE DEDUCTION OF ONE TRUTH FROM ANOTHER AND
CHARLES IS SAFE BUT I CANNOT SAFELY LEAVE THIS PLACE YET I HAVE OBTAINED THE FAVOUR THAT THE BEARER HAS A SHORT NOTE FROM CHARLES TO HIS WIFE
AND BY CONTINUALLY EXERCISING MYSELF IN MY CHOSEN METHOD
TRUTH IN THE SCIENCES THE MATHEMATICIANS ALONE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY DEMONSTRATIONS THAT IS ANY CERTAIN AND EVIDENT REASONS I DID NOT DOUBT BUT THAT SUCH MUST HAVE BEEN THE RULE OF THEIR INVESTIGATIONS
FOR THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTRARY TO THE ORDER PRESCRIBED IN THE METHOD
YES THAT SHE MAY BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE THE FACES AND KNOW THE PERSONS IT IS FOR THEIR SAFETY BEGINNING TO BE STRUCK BY DEFARGE'S MANNER MISTER LORRY LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIM AND LED THE WAY
GOVERNED BY OUR DESIRES AND PRECEPTORS WHOSE DICTATES WERE FREQUENTLY CONFLICTING WHILE NEITHER PERHAPS ALWAYS COUNSELED US FOR THE BEST I FARTHER CONCLUDED THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT OUR JUDGMENTS CAN BE SO CORRECT OR SOLID
MY MIND TO THE LOVE AND NOURISHMENT OF TRUTH AND TO A DISTASTE FOR ALL SUCH REASONINGS AS WERE UNSOUND BUT I HAD NO INTENTION ON THAT ACCOUNT OF ATTEMPTING TO MASTER ALL
AND TO SPEAK OF HUMAN AFFAIRS I BELIEVE THAT THE PRE EMINENCE OF SPARTA WAS DUE NOT TO THE GOODNESS OF EACH OF ITS LAWS IN PARTICULAR FOR MANY OF THESE WERE VERY STRANGE AND EVEN OPPOSED TO GOOD MORALS BUT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT
AND AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR ITS ADEQUATE SOLUTION THE THIRD TO CONDUCT MY THOUGHTS IN SUCH ORDER THAT BY COMMENCING WITH OBJECTS THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW
AND THE CHILD IT IS ENOUGH MY HUSBAND SAID MADAME DEFARGE I HAVE SEEN THEM WE MAY GO BUT THE SUPPRESSED MANNER HAD ENOUGH OF MENACE IN IT
NOT VISIBLE AND PRESENTED BUT INDISTINCT AND WITHHELD TO ALARM LUCIE INTO SAYING AS SHE LAID HER APPEALING HAND ON MADAME DEFARGE'S DRESS
AND WILL LOSE THEMSELVES AND CONTINUE TO WANDER FOR LIFE IN THE SECOND PLACE OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED OF SUFFICIENT SENSE OR MODESTY TO DETERMINE THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO EXCEL THEM IN THE POWER OF DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN TRUTH AND ERROR
ARE GENERALLY MORE ELEGANT AND COMMODIOUS THAN THOSE WHICH SEVERAL HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IMPROVE
WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DEMUR BUT THE GREAT TRUST HE HELD WAS NOT HIS OWN AND AS TO THAT BUSINESS CHARGE
AND WAS BESIDES FORTUNATELY UNDISTURBED BY ANY CARES OR PASSIONS I REMAINED THE WHOLE DAY IN SECLUSION WITH FULL OPPORTUNITY TO OCCUPY MY ATTENTION WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS
MUCH INTERESTED AND AGITATED MISTER LORRY SAID
USING HIS NATURAL AND UNPREJUDICED JUDGMENT DRAWS RESPECTING THE MATTERS OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL TO PASS THROUGH A STATE OF INFANCY TO MANHOOD AND HAVE BEEN OF NECESSITY FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
I MIGHT ASCEND BY LITTLE AND LITTLE AND AS IT WERE STEP BY STEP TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MORE COMPLEX ASSIGNING IN THOUGHT A CERTAIN ORDER EVEN TO THOSE OBJECTS WHICH IN THEIR OWN NATURE DO NOT STAND IN A RELATION OF ANTECEDENCE AND SEQUENCE
AND EVERY MINUTE'S DELAY TENDING TO COMPROMISE TELLSON'S MISTER LORRY ADVISED WITH LUCIE SHE SAID THAT HER FATHER HAD SPOKEN OF HIRING A LODGING FOR A SHORT TERM IN THAT QUARTER NEAR THE BANKING HOUSE AS THERE WAS NO BUSINESS OBJECTION TO THIS
TO THIS LODGING HE AT ONCE REMOVED LUCIE AND HER CHILD AND MISS PROSS GIVING THEM WHAT COMFORT HE COULD AND MUCH MORE THAN HE HAD HIMSELF HE LEFT JERRY WITH THEM
FOR NEITHER OF WHICH WOULD THIS BE AT ALL A BEFITTING RESOLUTION IN THE FIRST PLACE OF THOSE WHO WITH MORE THAN A DUE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN POWERS ARE PRECIPITATE IN THEIR JUDGMENTS AND WANT THE PATIENCE REQUISITE FOR ORDERLY AND CIRCUMSPECT THINKING
NOR IN THIS PERHAPS SHALL I APPEAR TOO VAIN IF IT BE CONSIDERED THAT AS THE TRUTH ON ANY PARTICULAR POINT IS ONE WHOEVER APPREHENDS THE TRUTH KNOWS ALL THAT ON THAT POINT CAN BE KNOWN
PART TWO I WAS THEN IN GERMANY ATTRACTED THITHER BY THE WARS IN THAT COUNTRY WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN BROUGHT TO A TERMINATION AND AS I WAS RETURNING TO THE ARMY FROM THE CORONATION OF THE EMPEROR
PROBABLE REASONINGS WITHOUT DEMONSTRATIONS COMPOSED AS THEY ARE OF THE OPINIONS OF MANY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS MASSED TOGETHER ARE FARTHER REMOVED FROM TRUTH THAN THE SIMPLE INFERENCES WHICH A MAN OF GOOD SENSE
TO THE VENGEANCE WHOM HER EYES FIRST ENCOUNTERED WELL I AM SURE BOLDFACE I HOPE
HAS MUCH INFLUENCE AROUND HIM SURELY IT WILL RELEASE HIM SAID MADAME DEFARGE LET IT DO SO
FORCED UPON THEM SIMPLY BY EXPERIENCE OF THE HURTFULNESS OF PARTICULAR CRIMES AND DISPUTES WOULD BY THIS PROCESS COME TO BE POSSESSED OF LESS PERFECT INSTITUTIONS THAN THOSE WHICH FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THEIR ASSOCIATION AS COMMUNITIES
IN THE SAME WAY I THOUGHT THAT THE SCIENCES CONTAINED IN BOOKS
AS IT WERE TO USE MY OWN REASON IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE BUT LIKE ONE WALKING ALONE AND IN THE DARK I RESOLVED TO PROCEED SO SLOWLY AND WITH SUCH CIRCUMSPECTION
AND ALTHOUGH THIS SCIENCE CONTAINS INDEED A NUMBER OF CORRECT AND VERY EXCELLENT PRECEPTS THERE ARE NEVERTHELESS SO MANY OTHERS AND THESE
CAREFULLY TO SATISFY MYSELF OF THE GENERAL NATURE OF THE TASK I WAS SETTING MYSELF AND ASCERTAIN THE TRUE METHOD BY WHICH TO ARRIVE AT THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHATEVER LAY WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY POWERS
TO THE END THAT SHE MAY KNOW THEM THAT SHE MAY IDENTIFY THEM I BELIEVE SAID MISTER LORRY RATHER HALTING IN HIS REASSURING WORDS AS THE STONY MANNER OF ALL THE THREE IMPRESSED ITSELF UPON HIM MORE AND MORE
AND THAT MANY SUCH EXIST THE DIVERSITY OF CONSTITUTIONS IS ALONE SUFFICIENT TO ASSURE US CUSTOM HAS WITHOUT DOUBT MATERIALLY SMOOTHED THEIR INCONVENIENCES AND HAS EVEN MANAGED TO STEER ALTOGETHER CLEAR OF
AND CLOSED THE DOOR COURAGE MY DEAR LUCIE SAID MISTER LORRY AS HE RAISED HER COURAGE COURAGE SO FAR ALL GOES WELL WITH US
OFTEN ENOUGH ALL OUR LIVES WE HAVE SEEN OUR SISTER WOMEN SUFFER IN THEMSELVES AND IN THEIR CHILDREN POVERTY NAKEDNESS HUNGER THIRST SICKNESS
AT LITTLE LUCIE AS IF IT WERE THE FINGER OF FATE YES MADAME ANSWERED MISTER LORRY THIS IS OUR POOR PRISONER'S DARLING DAUGHTER AND ONLY CHILD
AND THE MAJORITY OF ITS OTHER PRECEPTS ARE OF AVAIL RATHER IN THE COMMUNICATION OF WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW OR EVEN AS THE ART OF LULLY IN SPEAKING WITHOUT JUDGMENT OF THINGS OF WHICH WE ARE IGNORANT THAN IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE UNKNOWN
THE SHADOW ATTENDANT ON MADAME DEFARGE AND HER PARTY SEEMED TO FALL SO THREATENING AND DARK ON THE CHILD THAT HER MOTHER INSTINCTIVELY KNEELED ON THE GROUND BESIDE HER AND HELD HER TO HER BREAST
WITHIN AN HOUR WILL YOU ACCOMPANY ME SAID MISTER LORRY JOYFULLY RELIEVED AFTER READING THIS NOTE ALOUD TO WHERE HIS WIFE RESIDES
ALL WELL WITH CHARLES AND HE WERE TO BE RELEASED HE COULD NOT HOPE TO LEAVE THE CITY MISTER LORRY WENT OUT IN QUEST OF SUCH A LODGING AND FOUND A SUITABLE ONE HIGH UP IN A REMOVED BY STREET
IN THIS INSTANCE IS WITHIN THE REACH OF HUMAN GENIUS NOW IN CONCLUSION THE METHOD WHICH TEACHES ADHERENCE TO THE TRUE ORDER AND AN EXACT ENUMERATION OF ALL THE CONDITIONS OF THE THING SOUGHT
AS A FIGURE TO FILL A DOORWAY THAT WOULD BEAR CONSIDERABLE KNOCKING ON THE HEAD AND RETAINED TO HIS OWN OCCUPATIONS A DISTURBED AND DOLEFUL MIND HE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON THEM AND SLOWLY AND HEAVILY THE DAY LAGGED ON WITH HIM
THE SINGLE DESIGN TO STRIP ONE'S SELF OF ALL PAST BELIEFS IS ONE THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE TAKEN BY EVERY ONE THE MAJORITY OF MEN IS COMPOSED OF TWO CLASSES
THE BRIEFEST POSSIBLE IN THIS WAY I BELIEVED THAT I COULD BORROW ALL THAT WAS BEST BOTH IN GEOMETRICAL ANALYSIS AND IN ALGEBRA AND CORRECT ALL THE DEFECTS OF THE ONE BY HELP OF THE OTHER
TURNING TO HER FRIEND THE VENGEANCE THE WIVES AND MOTHERS WE HAVE BEEN USED TO SEE SINCE WE WERE AS LITTLE AS THIS CHILD AND MUCH LESS HAVE NOT BEEN GREATLY CONSIDERED
MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN IT HAS OF LATE GONE WITH MANY POOR SOULS CHEER UP AND HAVE A THANKFUL HEART I AM NOT THANKLESS I HOPE
SERVE FOR PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEY WERE NOT ORIGINALLY BUILT THUS ALSO THOSE ANCIENT CITIES WHICH FROM BEING AT FIRST ONLY VILLAGES HAVE BECOME IN COURSE OF TIME LARGE TOWNS
BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS I WAS INDUCED TO SEEK SOME OTHER METHOD WHICH WOULD COMPRISE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE THREE AND BE EXEMPT FROM THEIR DEFECTS AND AS A MULTITUDE OF LAWS OFTEN ONLY HAMPERS JUSTICE
INFLUENCE HE SAYS SOMETHING TOUCHING INFLUENCE
WHO HAD BEEN UNEASILY BITING HIS THUMB NAIL AND LOOKING AT HER COLLECTED HIS FACE INTO A STERNER EXPRESSION WHAT IS IT THAT YOUR HUSBAND SAYS IN THAT LITTLE LETTER
SHE STOPPED IN THE ACT OF PUTTING THE NOTE IN HER BOSOM AND WITH HER HANDS YET AT HER NECK LOOKED TERRIFIED AT MADAME DEFARGE
IN WHICH I FOUND NOTHING CERTAIN I THOUGHT IT NECESSARY FIRST OF ALL TO ENDEAVOR TO ESTABLISH ITS PRINCIPLES AND BECAUSE I OBSERVED
ARE USUALLY BUT ILL LAID OUT COMPARED WITH THE REGULARITY CONSTRUCTED TOWNS WHICH A PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT HAS FREELY PLANNED ON AN OPEN PLAIN SO THAT ALTHOUGH THE SEVERAL BUILDINGS OF THE FORMER
WAS THE ASSURANCE I HAD OF THEREBY EXERCISING MY REASON IN ALL MATTERS IF NOT WITH ABSOLUTE PERFECTION AT LEAST WITH THE GREATEST ATTAINABLE BY ME BESIDES I WAS CONSCIOUS
THE LONG CHAINS OF SIMPLE AND EASY REASONINGS BY MEANS OF WHICH GEOMETERS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO REACH THE CONCLUSIONS OF THEIR MOST DIFFICULT DEMONSTRATIONS
THAT IN THE TWO OR THREE MONTHS I DEVOTED TO THEIR EXAMINATION NOT ONLY DID I REACH SOLUTIONS OF QUESTIONS I HAD FORMERLY DEEMED EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT BUT EVEN AS REGARDS QUESTIONS OF THE SOLUTION OF WHICH I CONTINUED IGNORANT
AND THE LAST IN EVERY CASE TO MAKE ENUMERATIONS SO COMPLETE AND REVIEWS SO GENERAL THAT I MIGHT BE ASSURED THAT NOTHING WAS OMITTED
EMPLOYED MUCH OF MY TIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE WORK AS WELL BY ERADICATING FROM MY MIND ALL THE ERRONEOUS OPINIONS I HAD UP TO THAT MOMENT ACCEPTED AS BY AMASSING VARIETY OF EXPERIENCE TO AFFORD MATERIALS FOR MY REASONINGS
AND WITHOUT BY ANY MEANS RESTRICTING THEM TO THESE THAT AFTERWARDS I MIGHT THUS BE THE BETTER ABLE TO APPLY THEM TO EVERY OTHER CLASS OF OBJECTS TO WHICH THEY ARE LEGITIMATELY APPLICABLE
AND THEREBY RENDERING THE STREETS MORE HANDSOME BUT IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL TAKES DOWN HIS OWN WITH THE VIEW OF ERECTING IT ANEW AND THAT PEOPLE ARE EVEN SOMETIMES CONSTRAINED TO THIS WHEN THEIR HOUSES ARE IN DANGER OF FALLING FROM AGE
SUBSISTING AMONG THOSE OBJECTS I THOUGHT IT BEST FOR MY PURPOSE TO CONSIDER THESE PROPORTIONS IN THE MOST GENERAL FORM POSSIBLE WITHOUT REFERRING THEM TO ANY OBJECTS IN PARTICULAR
TO MY MIND SO CLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY AS TO EXCLUDE ALL GROUND OF DOUBT THE SECOND
THEN AS TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE ANCIENTS AND THE ALGEBRA OF THE MODERNS BESIDES THAT THEY EMBRACE ONLY MATTERS HIGHLY ABSTRACT AND TO APPEARANCE OF NO USE THE FORMER IS SO EXCLUSIVELY RESTRICTED
REPUDIATED HIM HE LIVED IN THE MOST VIOLENT QUARTER AND DOUBTLESS WAS INFLUENTIAL THERE AND DEEP IN ITS DANGEROUS WORKINGS NOON COMING AND THE DOCTOR NOT RETURNING
AMONG THE BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY I HAD AT AN EARLIER PERIOD GIVEN SOME ATTENTION TO LOGIC AND AMONG THOSE OF THE MATHEMATICS TO GEOMETRICAL ANALYSIS AND ALGEBRA
AND IF I THOUGHT THAT THIS TRACT CONTAINED AUGHT WHICH MIGHT JUSTIFY THE SUSPICION THAT I WAS A VICTIM OF SUCH FOLLY I WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT ITS PUBLICATION
WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO SEE THAT PRIVATE BUILDINGS CONTRIBUTED TO PUBLIC ORNAMENT THE DIFFICULTY OF REACHING HIGH PERFECTION WITH BUT THE MATERIALS OF OTHERS TO OPERATE ON WILL BE READILY ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE SAME WAY
BUT I HAD BECOME AWARE EVEN SO EARLY AS DURING MY COLLEGE LIFE THAT NO OPINION HOWEVER ABSURD AND INCREDIBLE CAN BE IMAGINED WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MAINTAINED BY SOME ON OF THE PHILOSOPHERS AND AFTERWARDS
YOU HAD BETTER LUCIE SAID MISTER LORRY DOING ALL HE COULD TO PROPITIATE BY TONE AND MANNER HAVE THE DEAR CHILD HERE AND OUR GOOD PROSS
I REMARKED THAT A PLURALITY OF SUFFRAGES IS NO GUARANTEE OF TRUTH WHERE IT IS AT ALL OF DIFFICULT DISCOVERY AS IN SUCH CASES IT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT IT WILL BE FOUND BY ONE THAN BY MANY
SHE ALSO BESTOWED A BRITISH COUGH ON MADAME DEFARGE BUT NEITHER OF THE TWO TOOK MUCH HEED OF HER
AND OVERTURNING IT IN ORDER TO SET IT UP AMENDED AND THE SAME I THOUGHT WAS TRUE OF ANY SIMILAR PROJECT FOR REFORMING THE BODY OF THE SCIENCES OR THE ORDER OF TEACHING THEM ESTABLISHED IN THE SCHOOLS
MISERY OPPRESSION AND NEGLECT OF ALL KINDS WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING ELSE RETURNED THE VENGEANCE
WHICH I DID NOT CLEARLY KNOW TO BE SUCH THAT IS TO SAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID PRECIPITANCY AND PREJUDICE AND TO COMPRISE NOTHING MORE IN MY JUDGEMENT THAN WHAT WAS PRESENTED
THREE ARTS OR SCIENCES WHICH OUGHT AS I CONCEIVED TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING TO MY DESIGN BUT ON EXAMINATION I FOUND THAT AS FOR LOGIC ITS SYLLOGISMS
AND BY WHOM THEY MAY BE INSTRUCTED OUGHT RATHER TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THE OPINIONS OF SUCH THAN TRUST FOR MORE CORRECT TO THEIR OWN REASON FOR MY OWN PART
I STATE THE CASE CITIZEN DEFARGE
I RESOLVED TO COMMENCE THEREFORE WITH THE EXAMINATION OF THE SIMPLEST OBJECTS NOT ANTICIPATING HOWEVER FROM THIS ANY OTHER ADVANTAGE THAN THAT TO BE FOUND IN ACCUSTOMING
UPON WHICH DIFFERENT HANDS HAD BEEN EMPLOYED AS IN THOSE COMPLETED BY A SINGLE MASTER THUS IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT THE BUILDINGS WHICH A SINGLE ARCHITECT HAS PLANNED AND EXECUTED
I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS THEREFORE RECOMMEND TO EVERY ONE ELSE TO MAKE A SIMILAR ATTEMPT THOSE WHOM GOD HAS ENDOWED WITH A LARGER MEASURE OF GENIUS WILL ENTERTAIN PERHAPS DESIGNS STILL MORE EXALTED
I THOUGHT THAT IN ORDER THE BETTER TO CONSIDER THEM INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD VIEW THEM AS SUBSISTING BETWEEN STRAIGHT LINES THAN WHICH I COULD FIND NO OBJECTS MORE SIMPLE
INCLUDES ALL THAT GIVES CERTITUDE TO THE RULES OF ARITHMETIC BUT THE CHIEF GROUND OF MY SATISFACTION WITH THUS METHOD
I WAS ENABLED AS IT APPEARED TO ME TO DETERMINE THE MEANS WHEREBY AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH A SOLUTION WAS POSSIBLE
IN A FEW MOMENTS A MAN STOOD IN HIS PRESENCE WHO WITH A KEENLY OBSERVANT LOOK AT HIM ADDRESSED HIM BY HIS NAME YOUR SERVANT SAID MISTER LORRY DO YOU KNOW ME HE WAS A STRONGLY MADE MAN
HAVE FOLLOWED THE APPOINTMENTS OF SOME WISE LEGISLATOR IT IS THUS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE TRUE RELIGION THE ORDINANCES OF WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM GOD MUST BE INCOMPARABLY SUPERIOR TO THAT OF EVERY OTHER
BOTH THE WOMEN FOLLOWED THE SECOND WOMAN BEING THE VENGEANCE THEY PASSED THROUGH THE INTERVENING STREETS AS QUICKLY AS THEY MIGHT ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE OF THE NEW DOMICILE WERE ADMITTED BY JERRY AND FOUND LUCIE WEEPING
IT WORE ITSELF OUT AND WORE HIM OUT WITH IT UNTIL THE BANK CLOSED HE WAS AGAIN ALONE IN HIS ROOM OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT CONSIDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT WHEN HE HEARD A FOOT UPON THE STAIR
OR INSENSIBLY CORRECTED A NUMBER WHICH SAGACITY COULD NOT HAVE PROVIDED AGAINST WITH EQUAL EFFECT AND IN FINE THE DEFECTS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS MORE TOLERABLE
WAS THIS THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO IMPERIL TELLSON'S BY SHELTERING THE WIFE OF AN EMIGRANT PRISONER UNDER THE BANK ROOF HIS OWN POSSESSIONS SAFETY LIFE HE WOULD HAVE HAZARDED FOR LUCIE AND HER CHILD
I SHOULD MUCH BETTER SUCCEED IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE THAN IF I BUILT ONLY UPON OLD FOUNDATIONS AND LEANED UPON PRINCIPLES WHICH IN MY YOUTH I HAD TAKEN UPON TRUST
KISS OUR CHILD FOR ME THAT WAS ALL THE WRITING IT WAS SO MUCH HOWEVER TO HER WHO RECEIVED IT
IF ONCE OVERTHROWN ARE WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY SET UP AGAIN OR EVEN KEPT ERECT WHEN ONCE SERIOUSLY SHAKEN AND THE FALL OF SUCH IS ALWAYS DISASTROUS THEN IF THERE ARE ANY IMPERFECTIONS IN THE CONSTITUTIONS OF STATES
THAT BY ITS USE MY MIND WAS BECOMING GRADUALLY HABITUATED TO CLEARER AND MORE DISTINCT CONCEPTIONS OF ITS OBJECTS AND I HOPED ALSO FROM NOT HAVING RESTRICTED THIS METHOD TO ANY PARTICULAR MATTER TO APPLY IT TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE OTHER SCIENCES
YOU WILL DO HIM NO HARM YOU WILL HELP ME TO SEE HIM IF YOU CAN YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT MY BUSINESS HERE RETURNED MADAME DEFARGE LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE IT IS THE DAUGHTER OF YOUR FATHER WHO IS MY BUSINESS HERE
OF THESE ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THAT OCCURRED TO ME WAS THAT THERE IS SELDOM SO MUCH PERFECTION IN WORKS COMPOSED OF MANY SEPARATE PARTS
WITH DARK CURLING HAIR FROM FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY YEARS OF AGE FOR ANSWER HE REPEATED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF EMPHASIS THE WORDS DO YOU KNOW ME I HAVE SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE PERHAPS AT MY WINE SHOP
A COFFIN DECKED WITH FLOWERS WAS BORNE FORTH THEN SHE KNEW THAT THE OLD LADY WAS DEAD AND FELT THAT SHE WAS ABANDONED BY ALL AND CONDEMNED BY THE ANGEL OF GOD SHE DANCED
AND THEN SAID TO THE CLERGYMAN HERE GIVE ME THE LITTLE GIRL I WILL ADOPT HER AND KAREN BELIEVED ALL THIS HAPPENED ON ACCOUNT OF THE RED SHOES BUT THE OLD LADY THOUGHT THEY WERE HORRIBLE AND THEY WERE BURNT
ALONG TIME AGO THERE LIVED AN OLD POET A THOROUGHLY KIND OLD POET AS HE WAS SITTING ONE EVENING IN HIS ROOM A DREADFUL STORM AROSE WITHOUT AND THE RAIN STREAMED DOWN FROM HEAVEN
REJOICING IN EACH OTHER'S PRAISE RESPECTABLE AND INNOCENT WHO FEEL THE THINGS THAT ALL MEN FEEL AND THINK IN WELL WORN GROOVES OF THOUGHT WHOSE HONEST SPIRITS NEVER REEL
O HAPPY PEOPLE I HAVE SEEN NO VERSE YET WRITTEN IN YOUR PRAISE AND TRUTH TO TELL THE TIME HAS BEEN I WOULD HAVE SCORNED YOUR EASY WAYS BUT NOW THRO WEARINESS AND STRIFE
ALEXANDRINES THERE IS A HOUSE THAT MOST OF ALL ON EARTH I HATE THOUGH I HAVE PASSED THROUGH MANY SORROWS AND HAVE BEEN
AND AWAY HE RAN THE NAUGHTY BOY TO SHOOT THE OLD POET IN THAT WAY HE WHO HAD TAKEN HIM INTO HIS WARM ROOM WHO HAD TREATED HIM SO KINDLY
I WILL TRY IT DIRECTLY AND HE BENT HIS BOW TOOK AIM AND SHOT AN ARROW AT THE OLD POET RIGHT INTO HIS HEART YOU SEE NOW THAT MY BOW WAS NOT SPOILED SAID HE LAUGHING
AND REPENTED OF HER SIN FROM HER HEART AND SHE WENT TO THE PARSONAGE AND BEGGED THAT THEY WOULD TAKE HER INTO SERVICE SHE WOULD BE VERY INDUSTRIOUS SHE SAID AND WOULD DO EVERYTHING SHE COULD
EVERYBODY LOOKED AT HER FEET AND WHEN SHE STEPPED THROUGH THE CHANCEL DOOR ON THE CHURCH PAVEMENT IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF THE OLD FIGURES ON THE TOMBS THOSE PORTRAITS OF OLD PREACHERS AND PREACHERS WIVES
AND HOLDS HER HEAD SO HIGH AND AWAY SHE WENT BOLDLY BUT SHE HAD NOT GOT FARTHER THAN THE CHURCHYARD GATE BEFORE SHE SAW THE RED SHOES DANCING BEFORE HER AND SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AND TURNED BACK
LIKE EYES OF ONE LONG DEAD THE EMPTY WINDOWS STARE AND I FEAR TO CROSS THE GARDEN I FEAR TO LINGER THERE FOR IN THAT HOUSE I KNOW A LITTLE SILENT ROOM
AND SHE PULLED DOWN HER STOCKINGS BUT THE SHOES SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN TO HER FEET AND SHE DANCED AND MUST DANCE OVER FIELDS AND MEADOWS IN RAIN AND SUNSHINE BY NIGHT AND DAY BUT AT NIGHT IT WAS THE MOST FEARFUL
BUT STRIKE OFF MY FEET IN THE RED SHOES AND THEN SHE CONFESSED HER ENTIRE SIN AND THE EXECUTIONER STRUCK OFF HER FEET WITH THE RED SHOES BUT THE SHOES DANCED AWAY WITH THE LITTLE FEET ACROSS THE FIELD INTO THE DEEP WOOD
AND SHE WAS FORCED TO DANCE THROUGH THE GLOOMY NIGHT THE SHOES CARRIED HER OVER STACK AND STONE SHE WAS TORN TILL SHE BLED SHE DANCED OVER THE HEATH TILL SHE CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE
HE SHOT AN ARROW ONCE AT YOUR OLD GRANDMOTHER BUT THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO AND IT IS ALL PAST NOW HOWEVER A THING OF THAT SORT SHE NEVER FORGETS
THIN ELEMENTAL PEOPLE DEAR WHO LIVE BEYOND OUR HEAVY SPHERE AND ALL AT ONCE FROM FAR AND NEAR THEY ALL HELD OUT THEIR ARMS TO ME CRYING IN THEIR MELODY
AND HOMELESS LONGING VEXES ME FOR LORE THAT I SHALL NEVER KNOW AND VISIONS NONE CAN HOPE TO SEE TILL BROODING WORKS UPON ME SO A CHILDISH FEAR STEALS OVER ME I LOOK AROUND THE EMPTY ROOM
AND DOWN THE MOSS GROWN PATHS AND TERRACE NO MAN TREADS WHERE THE OLD OLD WEEDS RISE DEEP ON THE WASTE GARDEN BEDS
ALL THIS LOOKED CHARMING BUT THE OLD LADY COULD NOT SEE WELL AND SO HAD NO PLEASURE IN THEM IN THE MIDST OF THE SHOES STOOD A PAIR OF RED ONES JUST LIKE THOSE THE PRINCESS HAD WORN HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY WERE
THE SHOES WERE PLACED IN A CLOSET AT HOME BUT KAREN COULD NOT AVOID LOOKING AT THEM NOW THE OLD LADY WAS SICK
AND SOON ANOTHER PHANTOM TIDE OF SHIFTING DREAMS BEGINS TO PLAY AND DUSKY GALLEYS PAST ME SAIL FULL FREIGHTED ON A FAERIE SEA I HEAR THE SILKEN MERCHANTS HAIL ACROSS THE RINGING WAVES TO ME
IN BLOODY FIELDS SAD SEAS AND COUNTRIES DESOLATE YET MOST I FEAR THAT EMPTY HOUSE WHERE THE GRASSES GREEN GROW IN THE SILENT COURT THE GAPING FLAGS BETWEEN
AND WHILST SHE READ WITH A PIOUS MIND THE WIND BORE THE STRAINS OF THE ORGAN TOWARDS HER AND SHE RAISED HER TEARFUL COUNTENANCE AND SAID O GOD HELP ME AND THE SUN SHONE SO CLEARLY
FOR ALL THY STUDY HUNTED THIS ON WINGS OF MAGIC TO ARISE AND WASH FROM OFF THY FILMED EYES THE CLOUD OF COLD MORTALITY TO FIND THE REAL LIFE AND BE AS ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE DEEP
AND THE TINTS OF HIS MANY COLORED ARROWS RAN ONE INTO THE OTHER THE OLD POET SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HIS HEARTH AND TOOK THE LITTLE FELLOW ON HIS LAP HE SQUEEZED THE WATER OUT OF HIS DRIPPING HAIR
DANCE IN THY RED SHOES TILL THOU ART PALE AND COLD TILL THY SKIN SHRIVELS UP AND THOU ART A SKELETON DANCE SHALT THOU FROM DOOR TO DOOR
THE FAMILY WENT TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD BUT SHE WENT ALONE INTO HER LITTLE CHAMBER THERE WAS ONLY ROOM FOR A BED AND CHAIR TO STAND IN IT AND HERE SHE SAT DOWN WITH HER PRAYER BOOK
AND THE ORGAN PEALED AND THE CHILDREN'S VOICES IN THE CHOIR SOUNDED SO SWEET AND SOFT THE CLEAR SUNSHINE STREAMED SO WARMLY THROUGH THE WINDOW INTO THE PEW WHERE KAREN SAT HER HEART WAS SO FULL OF SUNSHINE PEACE
SHE DANCED OVER THE CHURCHYARD BUT THE DEAD DID NOT DANCE THEY HAD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO DANCE
OH LET ME IN LET ME IN I AM COLD AND I'M SO WET EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY A CHILD THAT STOOD CRYING AT THE DOOR AND KNOCKING FOR ADMITTANCE WHILE THE RAIN POURED DOWN AND THE WIND MADE ALL THE WINDOWS RATTLE
WHERE THE BITTER TANSY GREW BUT FOR HER THERE WAS NEITHER PEACE NOR REST AND WHEN SHE DANCED TOWARDS THE OPEN CHURCH DOOR SHE SAW AN ANGEL STANDING THERE HE WORE LONG WHITE GARMENTS
WHEN THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS COME FROM THE LECTURES HE RUNS BESIDE THEM IN A BLACK COAT AND WITH A BOOK UNDER HIS ARM IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO KNOW HIM
WHICH WAS MORE RED THAN WHITE AND HE BOWED TO THE GROUND AND ASKED THE OLD LADY WHETHER HE MIGHT DUST HER SHOES AND KAREN STRETCHED OUT HER LITTLE FOOT SEE WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES
IN A WINDOW AND LET HERSELF BE STARED AT SHE HAD NEITHER A TRAIN NOR A GOLDEN CROWN BUT SPLENDID RED MOROCCO SHOES THEY WERE CERTAINLY FAR HANDSOMER
AND THE ORGAN PEALED SO SOLEMNLY THE SWEET CHILDREN'S VOICES SANG AND THE OLD MUSIC DIRECTORS SANG BUT KAREN ONLY THOUGHT OF HER RED SHOES
AND HE TOUCHED THE CEILING WITH THE SPRAY AND THE CEILING ROSE SO HIGH AND WHERE HE HAD TOUCHED IT THERE GLEAMED A GOLDEN STAR AND HE TOUCHED THE WALLS AND THEY WIDENED OUT AND SHE SAW THE ORGAN WHICH WAS PLAYING
SO THAT PEOPLE THINK IT IS REALLY A FLAME BUT THEY SOON DISCOVER IT IS SOMETHING ELSE HE ROVES ABOUT IN THE GARDEN OF THE PALACE AND UPON THE RAMPARTS YES ONCE HE EVEN SHOT YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER RIGHT IN THE HEART
BUT THE OLD POET SAT WARM AND COMFORTABLE IN HIS CHIMNEY CORNER WHERE THE FIRE BLAZED AND THE ROASTING APPLE HISSED THOSE WHO HAVE NOT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS WILL BE WETTED TO THE SKIN SAID THE GOOD OLD POET
OR ELSE SHE HAD COME INTO THE CHURCH SHE SAT IN THE PEW WITH THE CLERGYMAN'S FAMILY AND WHEN THEY HAD ENDED THE PSALM AND LOOKED UP THEY NODDED AND SAID IT IS RIGHT THAT THOU ART COME IT WAS THROUGH MERCY SHE SAID
SHE SAW THE OLD PICTURES OF THE PREACHERS AND THE PREACHERS WIVES THE CONGREGATION SAT IN CUSHIONED SEATS AND SANG OUT OF THEIR PRAYER BOOKS FOR THE CHURCH ITSELF HAD COME TO THE POOR GIRL IN HER NARROW CHAMBER
AND WHERE PROUD VAIN CHILDREN DWELL THOU SHALT KNOCK THAT THEY MAY HEAR THEE AND TREMBLE DANCE SHALT THOU MERCY CRIED KAREN BUT SHE DID NOT HEAR THE ANGEL'S REPLY
THE RED SHOES THERE WAS ONCE A LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS VERY PRETTY AND DELICATE BUT IN SUMMER SHE WAS FORCED TO RUN ABOUT WITH BARE FEET
BUT KAREN HERSELF WAS CLEANLY AND NICELY DRESSED SHE MUST LEARN TO READ AND SEW AND PEOPLE SAID SHE WAS A NICE LITTLE THING BUT THE LOOKING GLASS SAID THOU ART MORE THAN NICE THOU ART BEAUTIFUL
AND SHE WAS INDUSTRIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL SHE SAT STILL AND LISTENED WHEN THE CLERGYMAN READ THE BIBLE IN THE EVENINGS ALL THE CHILDREN THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF HER BUT WHEN THEY SPOKE OF DRESS AND GRANDEUR AND BEAUTY
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY WHEN THE FAMILY WAS GOING TO CHURCH THEY ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD NOT GO WITH THEM BUT SHE GLANCED SORROWFULLY WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AT HER CRUTCHES
I WILL TELL ALL CHILDREN ABOUT HIM THAT THEY MAY TAKE CARE AND NOT PLAY WITH HIM FOR HE WILL ONLY CAUSE THEM SORROW AND MANY A HEARTACHE
AND ALL GOOD CHILDREN TO WHOM HE RELATED THIS STORY TOOK GREAT HEED OF THIS NAUGHTY CUPID BUT HE MADE FOOLS OF THEM STILL FOR HE IS ASTONISHINGLY CUNNING
BEFORE MAN'S MYSTERY OVERWROUGHT YET NOT UNFAITHFUL NOR UNKIND WITH WORK DAY VIRTUES SURELY STAID THEIRS IS THE SANE AND HUMBLE MIND AND DULL AFFECTIONS UNDISMAYED
AND THEY WALK ALONG WITH HIM ARM IN ARM AS IF HE TOO WERE A STUDENT LIKE THEMSELVES AND THEN UNPERCEIVED HE THRUSTS AN ARROW TO THEIR BOSOM WHEN THE YOUNG MAIDENS COME FROM BEING EXAMINED BY THE CLERGYMAN
THE SUN SHONE GLORIOUSLY KAREN AND THE OLD LADY WALKED ALONG THE PATH THROUGH THE CORN IT WAS RATHER DUSTY THERE AT THE CHURCH DOOR STOOD AN OLD SOLDIER WITH A CRUTCH AND WITH A WONDERFULLY LONG BEARD
AND WITH STOCKINGLESS FEET SHE FOLLOWED THE POOR STRAW COFFIN IN THEM SUDDENLY A LARGE OLD CARRIAGE DROVE UP AND A LARGE OLD LADY SAT IN IT SHE LOOKED AT THE LITTLE GIRL FELT COMPASSION FOR HER
THE CLOCK STILL TICKING IN ITS PLACE AND ALL ELSE SILENT AS THE TOMB TILL SUDDENLY I THINK A FACE GROWS FROM THE DARKNESS JUST BESIDE I TURN AND LO IT FADES AWAY
THOU DOST NOT KNOW WHO I AM I FANCY I STRIKE BAD PEOPLE'S HEADS OFF AND I HEAR THAT MY AXE RINGS DON'T STRIKE MY HEAD OFF SAID KAREN THEN I CAN'T REPENT OF MY SINS
AND DANCED ROUND THE KIND OLD POET YOU ARE A MERRY FELLOW SAID THE OLD MAN WHAT'S YOUR NAME MY NAME IS CUPID ANSWERED THE BOY DON'T YOU KNOW ME
THOU SHALT HAVE WINE AND ROASTED APPLES FOR THOU ART VERILY A CHARMING CHILD AND THE BOY WAS SO REALLY HIS EYES WERE LIKE TWO BRIGHT STARS AND ALTHOUGH THE WATER TRICKLED DOWN HIS HAIR
WHERE SOMEONE'S ALWAYS WAITING WAITING IN THE GLOOM TO DRAW ME WITH AN EVIL EYE AND HOLD ME FAST YET THITHER DOOM WILL DRIVE ME AND HE WILL WIN AT LAST
WITH HOLLOW SOUNDS OF WINTRY FEAR AND THROUGH THE WATERS WASTE AND GREY THICK STROWN FOR MANY A LEAGUE AWAY OUT OF THE TOILING SEA AROSE MANY A FACE AND FORM OF THOSE
BE BOLD AND DARE THE GLORIOUS LEAP OR TO THY SHAME GO SLINK AGAIN BACK TO THE NARROW WAYS OF MEN SO ALL THESE MOCKED ME AS I STOOD STRIVING TO WAKE BECAUSE I FEARED THE FLOOD
FOR THE SHOES CARRIED HER THROUGH THE GATE INTO THE FIELDS ACROSS ROADS AND BRIDGES AND SHE MUST KEEP EVER DANCING ONE MORNING SHE DANCED PAST A DOOR WHICH SHE WELL KNEW WITHIN SOUNDED A PSALM
SHE LOOKED AT THE RED SHOES AND SHE THOUGHT THERE COULD BE NO SIN IN IT SHE PUT ON THE RED SHOES SHE MIGHT DO THAT ALSO SHE THOUGHT BUT THEN SHE WENT TO THE BALL AND BEGAN TO DANCE
I LEARN YOUR WORTHINESS INDEED THE WORLD IS BETTER FOR SUCH LIFE AS STOUT SUBURBAN PEOPLE LEAD TOO OFTEN HAVE I SAT ALONE WHEN THE WET NIGHT FALLS HEAVILY AND FRETTING WINDS AROUND ME MOAN
WITH US BELOW THE REAL SUN BECAUSE THE PLACE WAS FAR AWAY ABOVE BEYOND OUR HOMELY DAY NEIGHBOURING CLOSE THE FROZEN CLIME WHERE OUT OF ALL THE WOODS OF TIME AMID THE FRIGHTFUL SERAPHIM
SHE MUST BE NURSED AND WAITED UPON AND THERE WAS NO ONE WHOSE DUTY IT WAS SO MUCH AS KAREN'S BUT THERE WAS A GREAT BALL IN THE CITY TO WHICH KAREN WAS INVITED SHE LOOKED AT THE OLD LADY WHO COULD NOT RECOVER
THEN SUDDENLY AGAIN THE ROOM FAMILIAR BOOKS ABOUT ME PILED AND I ALONE AMID THE GLOOM BY ONE MORE MOCKING DREAM BEGUILED AND STILL NO NEARED TO THE LIGHT
LEAP IN LEAP IN AND TAKE THY FILL OF ALL THE COSMIC GOOD AND ILL BE AS THE LIVING ONES THAT KNOW ENORMOUS JOY ENORMOUS WOE PAIN BEYOND THOUGHT AND FIERY BLISS
POOR THING SAID THE OLD POET AS HE WENT TO OPEN THE DOOR THERE STOOD A LITTLE BOY QUITE NAKED AND THE WATER RAN DOWN FROM HIS LONG GOLDEN HAIR HE TREMBLED WITH COLD
NOTHING IN THE WORLD CAN BE COMPARED WITH RED SHOES NOW KAREN WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BE CONFIRMED SHE HAD NEW CLOTHES AND WAS TO HAVE NEW SHOES ALSO
IT WAVED IN BEAUTIFUL CURLS HE LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE A LITTLE ANGEL BUT HE WAS SO PALE AND HIS WHOLE BODY TREMBLED WITH COLD HE HAD A NICE LITTLE BOW IN HIS HAND BUT IT WAS QUITE SPOILED BY THE RAIN
AND WAS FORCED TO DANCE STRAIGHT OUT INTO THE GLOOMY WOOD THEN IT WAS SUDDENLY LIGHT UP AMONG THE TREES AND SHE FANCIED IT MUST BE THE MOON FOR THERE WAS A FACE
HE HAD WINGS WHICH REACHED FROM HIS SHOULDERS TO THE EARTH HIS COUNTENANCE WAS SEVERE AND GRAVE AND IN HIS HAND HE HELD A SWORD BROAD AND GLITTERING DANCE SHALT THOU SAID HE
THE RICH SHOEMAKER IN THE CITY TOOK THE MEASURE OF HER LITTLE FOOT THIS TOOK PLACE AT HIS HOUSE IN HIS ROOM WHERE STOOD LARGE GLASS CASES FILLED WITH ELEGANT SHOES AND BRILLIANT BOOTS
AND WENT INTO THE CHURCH WITH KAREN AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH LOOKED AT KAREN'S RED SHOES AND ALL THE PICTURES AND AS KAREN KNELT BEFORE THE ALTAR AND RAISED THE CUP TO HER LIPS
AND THE OLD LADY GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE KAREN RAISED HER FOOT TO GET IN AFTER HER WHEN THE OLD SOLDIER SAID LOOK WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES AND KAREN COULD NOT HELP DANCING A STEP OR TWO
SAID THE SOLDIER SIT FIRM WHEN YOU DANCE AND HE PUT HIS HAND OUT TOWARDS THE SOLES
A LITTLE PAIR OF SHOES OUT OF OLD RED STRIPS OF CLOTH THEY WERE VERY CLUMSY BUT IT WAS A KIND THOUGHT THEY WERE MEANT FOR THE LITTLE GIRL THE LITTLE GIRL WAS CALLED KAREN
SHE WAS SO POOR AND IN WINTER WEAR VERY LARGE WOODEN SHOES WHICH MADE HER LITTLE INSTEPS QUITE RED AND THAT LOOKED SO DANGEROUS
L'APPRENTI SORCIER SUDDENLY THERE CAME TO ME THE MUSIC OF A MIGHTY SEA THAT ON A BARE AND IRON SHORE THUNDERED WITH A DEEPER ROAR THAN ALL THE TIDES THAT LEAP AND RUN
AND THEY FITTED AND WERE BOUGHT BUT THE OLD LADY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THEIR BEING RED ELSE SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED KAREN TO HAVE GONE IN RED SHOES TO BE CONFIRMED YET SUCH WAS THE CASE
WITH STIFF RUFFS AND LONG BLACK DRESSES FIXED THEIR EYES ON HER RED SHOES AND SHE THOUGHT ONLY OF THEM AS THE CLERGYMAN LAID HIS HAND UPON HER HEAD AND SPOKE OF THE HOLY BAPTISM OF THE COVENANT WITH GOD
THE FIERCE COLD EYES OF GODHEAD GLEAM REVOLVING HATE AND MISERY AND WARS AND FAMINES YET TO BE AND IN MY DREAMS I STOOD ALONE UPON A SHELF OF WEEDY STONE
AND WHEN SHE BEGAN HER FEET CONTINUED TO DANCE IT WAS JUST AS THOUGH THE SHOES HAD POWER OVER THEM SHE DANCED ROUND THE CHURCH CORNER SHE COULD NOT LEAVE OFF THE COACHMAN WAS OBLIGED TO RUN AFTER AND CATCH HOLD OF HER
WARMED HIS HANDS BETWEEN HIS OWN AND BOILED FOR HIM SOME SWEET WINE THEN THE BOY RECOVERED HIS CHEEKS AGAIN GREW ROSY HE JUMPED DOWN FROM THE LAP WHERE HE WAS SITTING
AND SHE WAS TERRIFIED AND TURNED ROUND THE WHOLE WEEK SHE WAS UNHAPPY AND WEPT MANY BITTER TEARS BUT WHEN SUNDAY RETURNED SHE SAID WELL NOW I HAVE SUFFERED AND STRUGGLED ENOUGH
HERE SHE KNEW DWELT THE EXECUTIONER AND SHE TAPPED WITH HER FINGERS AT THE WINDOW AND SAID COME OUT COME OUT I CANNOT COME IN FOR I AM FORCED TO DANCE AND THE EXECUTIONER SAID
AND STRAIGHT BEFORE HER STOOD THE ANGEL OF GOD IN WHITE GARMENTS THE SAME SHE HAD SEEN THAT NIGHT AT THE CHURCH DOOR BUT HE NO LONGER CARRIED THE SHARP SWORD BUT IN ITS STEAD A SPLENDID GREEN SPRAY FULL OF ROSES
SHE DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE WAGES ONLY SHE WISHED TO HAVE A HOME AND BE WITH GOOD PEOPLE
NOW I HAVE SUFFERED ENOUGH FOR THE RED SHOES SAID SHE NOW I WILL GO INTO THE CHURCH THAT PEOPLE MAY SEE ME AND SHE HASTENED TOWARDS THE CHURCH DOOR BUT WHEN SHE WAS NEAR IT THE RED SHOES DANCED BEFORE HER
AND JOY THAT IT BROKE
NOW THE QUEEN ONCE TRAVELLED THROUGH THE LAND AND SHE HAD HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WITH HER AND THIS LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS A PRINCESS AND PEOPLE STREAMED TO THE CASTLE AND KAREN WAS THERE ALSO AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS STOOD IN HER FINE WHITE DRESS
THE SHOEMAKER SAID ALSO THEY HAD BEEN MADE FOR THE CHILD OF A COUNT BUT HAD NOT FITTED THAT MUST BE PATENT LEATHER SAID THE OLD LADY THEY SHINE SO YES THEY SHINE SAID KAREN
THAT WERE SAD INDEED SAID THE BOY AND HE TOOK THE BOW IN HIS HAND AND EXAMINED IT ON EVERY SIDE OH IT IS DRY AGAIN AND IS NOT HURT AT ALL THE STRING IS QUITE TIGHT
IN THE AFTERNOON THE OLD LADY HEARD FROM EVERYONE THAT THE SHOES HAD BEEN RED AND SHE SAID THAT IT WAS VERY WRONG OF KAREN THAT IT WAS NOT AT ALL BECOMING AND THAT IN FUTURE KAREN SHOULD ONLY GO IN BLACK SHOES TO CHURCH
AND HE CARVED OUT LITTLE WOODEN FEET FOR HER AND CRUTCHES TAUGHT HER THE PSALM CRIMINALS ALWAYS SING AND SHE KISSED THE HAND WHICH HAD WIELDED THE AXE AND WENT OVER THE HEATH
AND HE LIFTED HER IN THE CARRIAGE BUT HER FEET CONTINUED TO DANCE SO THAT SHE TROD ON THE OLD LADY DREADFULLY AT LENGTH SHE TOOK THE SHOES OFF AND THEN HER LEGS HAD PEACE
AND SAW BEFORE MY SHRINKING EYES THE DARK ENORMOUS BREAKERS RISE AND HOVER AND FALL WITH DEAFENING THUNDER OF THWARTED FOAM THAT ECHOED UNDER THE LEDGE THROUGH MANY A CAVERN DREAR
WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE TO THE RIGHT THE SHOES WOULD DANCE TO THE LEFT AND WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE UP THE ROOM THE SHOES DANCED BACK AGAIN DOWN THE STEPS INTO THE STREET AND OUT OF THE CITY GATE SHE DANCED
AND WHO HAD GIVEN HIM WARM WINE AND THE VERY BEST APPLES THE POOR POET LAY ON THE EARTH AND WEPT FOR THE ARROW HAD REALLY FLOWN INTO HIS HEART
OR GO TO CHURCH TO BE CONFIRMED THERE HE IS AGAIN CLOSE BEHIND THEM YES HE IS FOREVER FOLLOWING PEOPLE AT THE PLAY HE SITS IN THE GREAT CHANDELIER AND BURNS IN BRIGHT FLAMES
AND STILL NO FURTHER FROM MYSELF ALONE AND LOST IN CLINGING NIGHT THE CLOCK'S STILL TICKING ON THE SHELF THEN DO I ENVY SOLID FOLK WHO SIT OF EVENINGS BY THE FIRE
ON THE VERY DAY HER MOTHER WAS BURIED KAREN RECEIVED THE RED SHOES AND WORE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY WERE CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED FOR MOURNING BUT SHE HAD NO OTHERS
AND HAD HE NOT COME INTO A WARM ROOM HE WOULD MOST CERTAINLY HAVE PERISHED IN THE FRIGHTFUL TEMPEST POOR CHILD SAID THE OLD POET AS HE TOOK THE BOY BY THE HAND COME IN COME IN AND I WILL SOON RESTORE THEE
WHO WATER FLOWERS AND ROLL THE LAWN AND SIT AN SEW AND TALK AND SMOKE AND SNORE ALL THROUGH THE SUMMER DAWN WHO PASS UNTROUBLED NIGHTS AND DAYS FULL FED AND SLEEPILY CONTENT
SHE ONLY THOUGHT OF THE RED SHOES AND THEY SEEMED TO SWIM IN IT AND SHE FORGOT TO SING HER PSALM AND SHE FORGOT TO PRAY OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN NOW ALL THE PEOPLE WENT OUT OF CHURCH
HE SAT THERE NODDED HIS HEAD AND SAID LOOK WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES THEN SHE WAS TERRIFIED AND WANTED TO FLING OFF THE RED SHOES BUT THEY CLUNG FAST
IN PRAISE OF SOLID PEOPLE THANK
ASK THEM ONLY AND YOU WILL HEAR WHAT THEY'LL TELL YOU OH HE IS A NAUGHTY BOY THAT CUPID YOU MUST NEVER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM HE IS FOREVER RUNNING AFTER EVERYBODY ONLY THINK
THAT THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM TO OPEN HER MOUTH BUT SHE DID IT AT LAST AND MANAGED TO SWALLOW A MORSEL OF THE LEFTHAND BIT COME MY HEAD'S FREE AT LAST SAID ALICE IN A TONE OF DELIGHT WHICH CHANGED INTO ALARM IN ANOTHER MOMENT
AND A FEW BEING GOOD FELLOWS IN THE MAIN COULD NEITHER BE LED NOR DRIVEN ANY FURTHER IT IS ONE THING TO BE IDLE AND SKULK AND QUITE ANOTHER TO TAKE A SHIP AND MURDER A NUMBER OF INNOCENT MEN AT LAST HOWEVER THE PARTY WAS MADE UP
WHICH SHE FOUND TO BE NOTHING BUT THE TOPS OF THE TREES UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN WANDERING WHEN A SHARP HISS MADE HER DRAW BACK IN A HURRY A LARGE PIGEON HAD FLOWN INTO HER FACE AND WAS BEATING HER VIOLENTLY WITH ITS WINGS SERPENT SCREAMED THE PIGEON
THE HONEST HANDS AND I WAS SOON TO SEE IT PROVED THAT THERE WERE SUCH ON BOARD MUST HAVE BEEN VERY STUPID FELLOWS OR RATHER I SUPPOSE THE TRUTH WAS THIS THAT ALL HANDS WERE DISAFFECTED BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE RINGLEADERS ONLY SOME MORE SOME LESS
AND JUST AS I WAS THINKING I SHOULD BE FREE OF THEM AT LAST THEY MUST NEEDS COME WRIGGLING DOWN FROM THE SKY UGH SERPENT BUT I'M NOT A SERPENT I TELL YOU SAID ALICE I'M A I'M A WELL WHAT ARE YOU SAID THE PIGEON
IN A JIFFY I HAD SLIPPED OVER THE SIDE AND CURLED UP IN THE FORE SHEETS OF THE NEAREST BOAT AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT SHE SHOVED OFF NO ONE TOOK NOTICE OF ME ONLY THE BOW OAR SAYING IS THAT YOU JIM KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN
I HARDLY KNOW SIR JUST AT PRESENT AT LEAST I KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I GOT UP THIS MORNING BUT I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT SAID THE CATERPILLAR STERNLY EXPLAIN YOURSELF
AND WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE I HAD DRAWN NEAR TO THE FOOT OF THE LITTLE HILL WITH THE TWO PEAKS AND HAD GOT INTO A PART OF THE ISLAND WHERE THE LIVE OAKS GREW MORE WIDELY APART AND SEEMED MORE LIKE FOREST TREES IN THEIR BEARING AND DIMENSIONS
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE TO TURN INTO A CHRYSALIS YOU WILL SOME DAY YOU KNOW AND THEN AFTER THAT INTO A BUTTERFLY I SHOULD THINK YOU'LL FEEL IT A LITTLE QUEER WON'T YOU NOT A BIT SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL PERHAPS YOUR FEELINGS MAY BE DIFFERENT
THIS EVEN TINT WAS INDEED BROKEN UP BY STREAKS OF YELLOW SAND BREAK IN THE LOWER LANDS AND BY MANY TALL TREES OF THE PINE FAMILY OUT TOPPING THE OTHERS SOME SINGLY SOME IN CLUMPS BUT THE GENERAL COLOURING WAS UNIFORM AND SAD
BUT NOW JOHN PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET BROUGHT OUT A WHISTLE AND BLEW UPON IT SEVERAL MODULATED BLASTS THAT RANG FAR ACROSS THE HEATED AIR I COULD NOT TELL OF COURSE THE MEANING OF THE SIGNAL
A PECULIAR STAGNANT SMELL HUNG OVER THE ANCHORAGE A SMELL OF SODDEN LEAVES AND ROTTING TREE TRUNKS I OBSERVED THE DOCTOR SNIFFING AND SNIFFING LIKE SOMEONE TASTING A BAD EGG I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TREASURE HE SAID
WHY SAID THE CATERPILLAR HERE WAS ANOTHER PUZZLING QUESTION AND AS ALICE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY GOOD REASON AND AS THE CATERPILLAR SEEMED TO BE IN A VERY UNPLEASANT STATE OF MIND SHE TURNED AWAY
YOU ARE OLD SAID THE YOUTH ONE WOULD HARDLY SUPPOSE THAT YOUR EYE WAS AS STEADY AS EVER YET YOU BALANCED AN EEL ON THE END OF YOUR NOSE WHAT MADE YOU SO AWFULLY CLEVER
HE FAIRLY OUTSTRIPPED HIMSELF IN WILLINGNESS AND CIVILITY HE WAS ALL SMILES TO EVERYONE IF AN ORDER WERE GIVEN
AND WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT HER NECK WOULD BEND ABOUT EASILY IN ANY DIRECTION LIKE A SERPENT SHE HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN CURVING IT DOWN INTO A GRACEFUL ZIGZAG AND WAS GOING TO DIVE IN AMONG THE LEAVES
CHAPTER FIVE ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR THE CATERPILLAR AND ALICE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE AT LAST THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH
WAS A THING I NEVER LEARNED TO STAND WITHOUT A QUALM OR SO ABOVE ALL IN THE MORNING ON AN EMPTY STOMACH PERHAPS IT WAS THIS PERHAPS IT WAS THE LOOK OF THE ISLAND WITH ITS GREY MELANCHOLY WOODS AND WILD STONE SPIRES
THE THICKET STRETCHED DOWN FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THE SANDY KNOLLS SPREADING AND GROWING TALLER AS IT WENT UNTIL IT REACHED THE MARGIN OF THE BROAD REEDY FEN THROUGH WHICH THE NEAREST OF THE LITTLE RIVERS SOAKED ITS WAY INTO THE ANCHORAGE
HE KNEW THE PASSAGE LIKE THE PALM OF HIS HAND AND THOUGH THE MAN IN THE CHAINS GOT EVERYWHERE MORE WATER THAN WAS DOWN IN THE CHART JOHN NEVER HESITATED ONCE THERE'S A STRONG SCOUR WITH THE EBB HE SAID
FOR SOON I HEARD THE VERY DISTANT AND LOW TONES OF A HUMAN VOICE WHICH AS I CONTINUED TO GIVE EAR GREW STEADILY LOUDER AND NEARER THIS PUT ME IN A GREAT FEAR AND I CRAWLED UNDER COVER OF THE NEAREST LIVE OAK AND SQUATTED THERE
IF I DIE LIKE A DOG I'LL DIE IN MY DOOTY YOU'VE KILLED ALAN HAVE YOU KILL ME TOO IF YOU CAN BUT I DEFIES YOU AND WITH THAT THIS BRAVE FELLOW TURNED HIS BACK DIRECTLY ON THE COOK AND SET OFF WALKING FOR THE BEACH
AND AT THIS POINT TOM FLASHED OUT LIKE A HERO ALAN HE CRIED THEN REST HIS SOUL FOR A TRUE SEAMAN AND AS FOR YOU JOHN SILVER LONG YOU'VE BEEN A MATE OF MINE BUT YOU'RE MATE OF MINE NO MORE
TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHICH WERE THE TWO SIDES OF IT AND AS IT WAS PERFECTLY ROUND SHE FOUND THIS A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION HOWEVER AT LAST SHE STRETCHED HER ARMS ROUND IT AS FAR AS THEY WOULD GO AND BROKE OFF A BIT OF THE EDGE WITH EACH HAND
ONLY NOW AND AGAIN INTERRUPTED BY THE OTHER BY THE SOUND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TALKING EARNESTLY AND ALMOST FIERCELY BUT NO DISTINCT WORD CAME TO MY HEARING AT LAST THE SPEAKERS SEEMED TO HAVE PAUSED AND PERHAPS TO HAVE SAT DOWN
HOWEVER I'VE GOT BACK TO MY RIGHT SIZE THE NEXT THING IS TO GET INTO THAT BEAUTIFUL GARDEN HOW IS THAT TO BE DONE I WONDER AS SHE SAID THIS SHE CAME SUDDENLY UPON AN OPEN PLACE WITH A LITTLE HOUSE IN IT ABOUT FOUR FEET HIGH
I HAVE ANSWERED THREE QUESTIONS AND THAT IS ENOUGH SAID HIS FATHER DON'T GIVE YOURSELF AIRS DO YOU THINK I CAN LISTEN ALL DAY TO SUCH STUFF BE OFF OR I'LL KICK YOU DOWN STAIRS THAT IS NOT SAID RIGHT SAID THE CATERPILLAR
AND NOW WHICH IS WHICH SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND NIBBLED A LITTLE OF THE RIGHT HAND BIT TO TRY THE EFFECT THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FELT A VIOLENT BLOW UNDERNEATH HER CHIN IT HAD STRUCK HER FOOT
I CAN'T EXPLAIN MYSELF I'M AFRAID SIR SAID ALICE BECAUSE I'M NOT MYSELF YOU SEE I DON'T SEE SAID THE CATERPILLAR I'M AFRAID I CAN'T PUT IT MORE CLEARLY ALICE REPLIED VERY POLITELY
LIKE ENOUGH TO JUDGE FROM THE SOUND HIS BACK WAS BROKEN ON THE SPOT BUT HE HAD NO TIME GIVEN HIM TO RECOVER SILVER AGILE AS A MONKEY EVEN WITHOUT LEG OR CRUTCH WAS ON THE TOP OF HIM NEXT MOMENT
I HAVEN'T THE LEAST IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SAID ALICE I'VE TRIED THE ROOTS OF TREES AND I'VE TRIED BANKS AND I'VE TRIED HEDGES THE PIGEON WENT ON WITHOUT ATTENDING TO HER BUT THOSE SERPENTS THERE'S NO PLEASING THEM
ANOTHER FOLLOWED AND SOON OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE MARSH A GREAT CLOUD OF BIRDS HUNG SCREAMING AND CIRCLING IN THE AIR I JUDGED AT ONCE THAT SOME OF MY SHIPMATES MUST BE DRAWING NEAR ALONG THE BORDERS OF THE FEN NOR WAS I DECEIVED
COME BACK THE CATERPILLAR CALLED AFTER HER I'VE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS SOUNDED PROMISING CERTAINLY ALICE TURNED AND CAME BACK AGAIN KEEP YOUR TEMPER SAID THE CATERPILLAR
WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO BE A LITTLE LARGER SIR IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND SAID ALICE THREE INCHES IS SUCH A WRETCHED HEIGHT TO BE IT IS A VERY GOOD HEIGHT INDEED SAID THE CATERPILLAR ANGRILY REARING ITSELF UPRIGHT AS IT SPOKE
HEARKENING AS SILENT AS A MOUSE ANOTHER VOICE ANSWERED AND THEN THE FIRST VOICE WHICH I NOW RECOGNIZED TO BE SILVER'S ONCE MORE TOOK UP THE STORY AND RAN ON FOR A LONG WHILE IN A STREAM
HERE AT THAT SAME MOMENT CAME NEWS OF ANOTHER FAR AWAY OUT IN THE MARSH THERE AROSE ALL OF A SUDDEN A SOUND LIKE THE CRY OF ANGER THEN ANOTHER ON THE BACK OF IT AND THEN ONE HORRID LONG DRAWN SCREAM
WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FIRST THAT HAD EVER ANCHORED THERE SINCE THE ISLAND AROSE OUT OF THE SEAS THERE WAS NOT A BREATH OF AIR MOVING NOR A SOUND BUT THAT OF THE SURF BOOMING HALF A MILE AWAY ALONG THE BEACHES AND AGAINST THE ROCKS OUTSIDE
BUT YOU MAY SUPPOSE I PAID NO HEED
THE HILLS RAN UP CLEAR ABOVE THE VEGETATION IN SPIRES OF NAKED ROCK ALL WERE STRANGELY SHAPED AND THE SPY GLASS WHICH WAS BY THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED FEET THE TALLEST ON THE ISLAND WAS LIKEWISE THE STRANGEST IN CONFIGURATION
HOW MY SHORE ADVENTURE BEGAN THE APPEARANCE OF THE ISLAND WHEN I CAME ON DECK NEXT MORNING WAS ALTOGETHER CHANGED ALTHOUGH THE BREEZE HAD NOW UTTERLY CEASED
NIBBLING FIRST AT ONE AND THEN AT THE OTHER AND GROWING SOMETIMES TALLER AND SOMETIMES SHORTER UNTIL SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING HERSELF DOWN TO HER USUAL HEIGHT IT WAS SO LONG SINCE SHE HAD BEEN ANYTHING NEAR THE RIGHT SIZE
IF THEY NONE OF THEM GO WELL THEN WE HOLD THE CABIN AND GOD DEFEND THE RIGHT IF SOME GO YOU MARK MY WORDS SIR SILVER'LL BRING EM ABOARD AGAIN AS MILD AS LAMBS IT WAS SO DECIDED
I COULD HEAR HAILS COMING AND GOING BETWEEN THE OLD BUCCANEER AND HIS COMRADES AND THIS SOUND OF DANGER LENT ME WINGS AS SOON AS I WAS CLEAR OF THE THICKET I RAN AS I NEVER RAN BEFORE SCARCE MINDING THE DIRECTION OF MY FLIGHT
THE BOOMS WERE TEARING AT THE BLOCKS THE RUDDER WAS BANGING TO AND FRO AND THE WHOLE SHIP CREAKING GROANING AND JUMPING LIKE A MANUFACTORY
THE SLIGHTEST ORDER WAS RECEIVED WITH A BLACK LOOK AND GRUDGINGLY AND CARELESSLY OBEYED EVEN THE HONEST HANDS MUST HAVE CAUGHT THE INFECTION FOR THERE WAS NOT ONE MAN ABOARD TO MEND ANOTHER MUTINY IT WAS PLAIN
NOT QUITE RIGHT I'M AFRAID SAID ALICE TIMIDLY SOME OF THE WORDS HAVE GOT ALTERED IT IS WRONG FROM BEGINNING TO END SAID THE CATERPILLAR DECIDEDLY AND THERE WAS SILENCE FOR SOME MINUTES
AND YOU'VE MONEY TOO WHICH LOTS OF POOR SAILORS HASN'T AND YOU'RE BRAVE OR I'M MISTOOK
BUT I'LL STAKE MY WIG THERE'S FEVER HERE IF THE CONDUCT OF THE MEN HAD BEEN ALARMING IN THE BOAT IT BECAME TRULY THREATENING WHEN THEY HAD COME ABOARD THEY LAY ABOUT THE DECK GROWLING TOGETHER IN TALK
WHEN THE GUN FIRED HOW SHOULD I DARE TO GO DOWN TO THE BOATS AMONG THOSE FIENDS STILL SMOKING FROM THEIR CRIME WOULD NOT THE FIRST OF THEM WHO SAW ME WRING MY NECK LIKE A SNIPE'S
HUNG OVER US LIKE A THUNDER CLOUD AND IT WAS NOT ONLY WE OF THE CABIN PARTY WHO PERCEIVED THE DANGER LONG JOHN WAS HARD AT WORK GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP SPENDING HIMSELF IN GOOD ADVICE AND AS FOR EXAMPLE NO MAN COULD HAVE SHOWN A BETTER
JUST BEFORE HIM TOM LAY MOTIONLESS UPON THE SWARD BUT THE MURDERER MINDED HIM NOT A WHIT CLEANSING HIS BLOOD STAINED KNIFE THE WHILE UPON A WISP OF GRASS EVERYTHING ELSE WAS UNCHANGED
SIX FELLOWS WERE TO STAY ON BOARD AND THE REMAINING THIRTEEN INCLUDING SILVER BEGAN TO EMBARK THEN IT WAS THAT THERE CAME INTO MY HEAD THE FIRST OF THE MAD NOTIONS THAT CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH TO SAVE OUR LIVES
GOOD BYE TO THE SQUIRE THE DOCTOR AND THE CAPTAIN THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR ME BUT DEATH BY STARVATION OR DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THE MUTINEERS ALL THIS WHILE AS I SAY I WAS STILL RUNNING
BUT I DO KNOW THAT FOR THE NEXT LITTLE WHILE THE WHOLE WORLD SWAM AWAY FROM BEFORE ME IN A WHIRLING MIST SILVER AND THE BIRDS AND THE TALL SPY GLASS HILLTOP GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND TOPSY TURVY BEFORE MY EYES
ALICE WAS MORE AND MORE PUZZLED BUT SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO USE IN SAYING ANYTHING MORE TILL THE PIGEON HAD FINISHED AS IF IT WASN'T TROUBLE ENOUGH HATCHING THE EGGS SAID THE PIGEON BUT I MUST BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR SERPENTS NIGHT AND DAY
FOR NOT ONLY DID THEY CEASE TO DRAW ANY NEARER BUT THE BIRDS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO GROW MORE QUIET AND TO SETTLE AGAIN TO THEIR PLACES IN THE SWAMP AND NOW I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT I WAS NEGLECTING MY BUSINESS
IF SIX MEN WERE LEFT BY SILVER IT WAS PLAIN OUR PARTY COULD NOT TAKE AND FIGHT THE SHIP AND SINCE ONLY SIX WERE LEFT IT WAS EQUALLY PLAIN THAT THE CABIN PARTY HAD NO PRESENT NEED OF MY ASSISTANCE IT OCCURRED TO ME AT ONCE TO GO ASHORE
APPEARED THE WORST WE HELD A COUNCIL IN THE CABIN SIR SAID THE CAPTAIN IF I RISK ANOTHER ORDER THE WHOLE SHIP'LL COME ABOUT OUR EARS BY THE RUN YOU SEE SIR HERE IT IS I GET A ROUGH ANSWER DO I NOT
ALL SHINING WITH HEAT WAS LIFTED TO THE OTHER MAN'S IN A KIND OF APPEAL MATE HE WAS SAYING IT'S BECAUSE I THINKS GOLD DUST OF YOU GOLD DUST AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT IF I HADN'T TOOK TO YOU LIKE PITCH
I'VE TRIED TO SAY HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE BUT IT ALL CAME DIFFERENT ALICE REPLIED IN A VERY MELANCHOLY VOICE REPEAT YOU ARE OLD FATHER WILLIAM SAID THE CATERPILLAR ALICE FOLDED HER HANDS AND BEGAN
I DON'T KNOW SAID THE CATERPILLAR ALICE SAID NOTHING SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SO MUCH CONTRADICTED IN HER LIFE BEFORE AND SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS LOSING HER TEMPER
SHOT FAR AHEAD OF HER CONSORT AND THE BOW HAD STRUCK AMONG THE SHORE SIDE TREES AND I HAD CAUGHT A BRANCH AND SWUNG MYSELF OUT AND PLUNGED INTO THE NEAREST THICKET WHILE SILVER AND THE REST WERE STILL A HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND
ALL'S UP YOU CAN'T MAKE NOR MEND IT'S TO SAVE YOUR NECK THAT I'M A SPEAKING AND IF ONE OF THE WILD UNS KNEW IT WHERE'D I BE TOM NOW TELL ME WHERE'D I BE SILVER SAID THE OTHER MAN
THE SUN STILL SHINING MERCILESSLY ON THE STEAMING MARSH AND THE TALL PINNACLE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND I COULD SCARCE PERSUADE MYSELF THAT MURDER HAD BEEN ACTUALLY DONE AND A HUMAN LIFE CRUELLY CUT SHORT A MOMENT SINCE BEFORE MY EYES
I MADE STEADILY BUT SLOWLY TOWARDS THEM TILL AT LAST RAISING MY HEAD TO AN APERTURE AMONG THE LEAVES I COULD SEE CLEAR DOWN INTO A LITTLE GREEN DELL BESIDE THE MARSH AND CLOSELY SET ABOUT WITH TREES WHERE LONG JOHN SILVER
THEN IT GOT DOWN OFF THE MUSHROOM AND CRAWLED AWAY IN THE GRASS MERELY REMARKING AS IT WENT ONE SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW TALLER AND THE OTHER SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW SHORTER ONE SIDE OF WHAT
WHICH BROUGHT THEM BACK AGAIN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION ALICE FELT A LITTLE IRRITATED AT THE CATERPILLAR'S MAKING SUCH VERY SHORT REMARKS AND SHE DREW HERSELF UP AND SAID VERY GRAVELY I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME WHO YOU ARE FIRST
LEAPING BACK A YARD AS IT SEEMED TO ME WITH THE SPEED AND SECURITY OF A TRAINED GYMNAST HANDS OFF IF YOU LIKE JOHN SILVER SAID THE OTHER IT'S A BLACK CONSCIENCE THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEARED OF ME BUT IN HEAVEN'S NAME TELL ME WHAT WAS THAT
ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE OPEN STOOD ONE OF THE HILLS WITH TWO QUAINT CRAGGY PEAKS SHINING VIVIDLY IN THE SUN I NOW FELT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE JOY OF EXPLORATION THE ISLE WAS UNINHABITED
AND IT PUT THE HOOKAH INTO ITS MOUTH AND BEGAN SMOKING AGAIN THIS TIME ALICE WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL IT CHOSE TO SPEAK AGAIN IN A MINUTE OR TWO THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH AND YAWNED ONCE OR TWICE AND SHOOK ITSELF
AND THE BOATS HAD TO BE GOT OUT AND MANNED AND THE SHIP WARPED THREE OR FOUR MILES ROUND THE CORNER OF THE ISLAND AND UP THE NARROW PASSAGE TO THE HAVEN BEHIND SKELETON ISLAND I VOLUNTEERED FOR ONE OF THE BOATS WHERE I HAD OF COURSE NO BUSINESS
PART THREE MY SHORE ADVENTURE
THE HEAT WAS SWELTERING AND THE MEN GRUMBLED FIERCELY OVER THEIR WORK ANDERSON WAS IN COMMAND OF MY BOAT AND INSTEAD OF KEEPING THE CREW IN ORDER HE GRUMBLED AS LOUD AS THE WORST WELL HE SAID WITH AN OATH IT'S NOT FOREVER
WHY I HAVEN'T HAD A WINK OF SLEEP THESE THREE WEEKS I'M VERY SORRY YOU'VE BEEN ANNOYED SAID ALICE WHO WAS BEGINNING TO SEE ITS MEANING AND JUST AS I'D TAKEN THE HIGHEST TREE IN THE WOOD CONTINUED THE PIGEON RAISING ITS VOICE TO A SHRIEK
SO LONG AS IT LED ME FROM THE MURDERERS AND AS I RAN FEAR GREW AND GREW UPON ME UNTIL IT TURNED INTO A KIND OF FRENZY INDEED COULD ANYONE BE MORE ENTIRELY LOST THAN I
HIS EYE A MERE PIN POINT IN HIS BIG FACE BUT GLEAMING LIKE A CRUMB OF GLASS THAT
IN MY YOUTH SAID THE SAGE AS HE SHOOK HIS GREY LOCKS I KEPT ALL MY LIMBS VERY SUPPLE BY THE USE OF THIS OINTMENT ONE SHILLING THE BOX ALLOW ME TO SELL YOU A COUPLE YOU ARE OLD SAID THE YOUTH AND YOUR JAWS ARE TOO WEAK FOR ANYTHING TOUGHER THAN SUET
FOR HER NECK KEPT GETTING ENTANGLED AMONG THE BRANCHES AND EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE HAD TO STOP AND UNTWIST IT AFTER A WHILE SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE STILL HELD THE PIECES OF MUSHROOM IN HER HANDS AND SHE SET TO WORK VERY CAREFULLY
WOULD NOT MY ABSENCE ITSELF BE AN EVIDENCE TO THEM OF MY ALARM AND THEREFORE OF MY FATAL KNOWLEDGE IT WAS ALL OVER I THOUGHT
I'M NOT A SERPENT SAID ALICE INDIGNANTLY LET ME ALONE SERPENT I SAY AGAIN REPEATED THE PIGEON BUT IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE AND ADDED WITH A KIND OF SOB I'VE TRIED EVERY WAY AND NOTHING SEEMS TO SUIT THEM
MINGLED WITH THESE WERE A FEW SCATTERED PINES SOME FIFTY SOME NEARER SEVENTY FEET HIGH THE AIR TOO SMELT MORE FRESHLY THAN DOWN BESIDE THE MARSH
SAID ALICE ALL I KNOW IS IT WOULD FEEL VERY QUEER TO ME YOU SAID THE CATERPILLAR CONTEMPTUOUSLY
THE ROCKS OF THE SPY GLASS RE ECHOED IT A SCORE OF TIMES THE WHOLE TROOP OF MARSH BIRDS ROSE AGAIN DARKENING HEAVEN WITH A SIMULTANEOUS WHIRR AND LONG AFTER THAT DEATH YELL WAS STILL RINGING IN MY BRAIN
AND WITH STUNNING VIOLENCE RIGHT BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK HIS HANDS FLEW UP HE GAVE A SORT OF GASP AND FELL WHETHER HE WERE INJURED MUCH OR LITTLE NONE COULD EVER TELL
SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL FRIGHTENED BY THIS VERY SUDDEN CHANGE BUT SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST AS SHE WAS SHRINKING RAPIDLY SO SHE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO EAT SOME OF THE OTHER BIT HER CHIN WAS PRESSED SO CLOSELY AGAINST HER FOOT
THE CATERPILLAR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK WHAT SIZE DO YOU WANT TO BE IT ASKED OH I'M NOT PARTICULAR AS TO SIZE ALICE HASTILY REPLIED ONLY ONE DOESN'T LIKE CHANGING SO OFTEN YOU KNOW
THE PLUNGE OF OUR ANCHOR SENT UP CLOUDS OF BIRDS WHEELING AND CRYING OVER THE WOODS BUT IN LESS THAN A MINUTE THEY WERE DOWN AGAIN AND ALL WAS ONCE MORE SILENT THE PLACE WAS ENTIRELY LAND LOCKED BURIED IN WOODS
IT WAS EXACTLY THREE INCHES HIGH BUT I'M NOT USED TO IT PLEADED POOR ALICE IN A PITEOUS TONE AND SHE THOUGHT OF HERSELF I WISH THE CREATURES WOULDN'T BE SO EASILY OFFENDED YOU'LL GET USED TO IT IN TIME SAID THE CATERPILLAR
SILENCE HAD RE ESTABLISHED ITS EMPIRE AND ONLY THE RUSTLE OF THE REDESCENDING BIRDS AND THE BOOM OF THE DISTANT SURGES DISTURBED THE LANGUOR OF THE AFTERNOON TOM HAD LEAPED AT THE SOUND LIKE A HORSE AT THE SPUR
BUT HE WAS NOT DESTINED TO GO FAR WITH A CRY JOHN SEIZED THE BRANCH OF A TREE WHIPPED THE CRUTCH OUT OF HIS ARMPIT AND SENT THAT UNCOUTH MISSILE HURTLING THROUGH THE AIR IT STRUCK POOR TOM POINT FOREMOST
AND ADDRESSED HER IN A LANGUID SLEEPY VOICE WHO ARE YOU SAID THE CATERPILLAR THIS WAS NOT AN ENCOURAGING OPENING FOR A CONVERSATION ALICE REPLIED RATHER SHYLY I
HERE AND THERE I SAW SNAKES AND ONE RAISED HIS HEAD FROM A LEDGE OF ROCK AND HISSED AT ME WITH A NOISE NOT UNLIKE THE SPINNING OF A TOP LITTLE DID I SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS A DEADLY ENEMY AND THAT THE NOISE WAS THE FAMOUS RATTLE
LOADED PISTOLS WERE SERVED OUT TO ALL THE SURE MEN HUNTER JOYCE AND REDRUTH WERE TAKEN INTO OUR CONFIDENCE AND RECEIVED THE NEWS WITH LESS SURPRISE AND A BETTER SPIRIT THAN WE HAD LOOKED FOR AND THEN THE CAPTAIN WENT ON DECK AND ADDRESSED THE CREW
I'M AFRAID I AM SIR SAID ALICE I CAN'T REMEMBER THINGS AS I USED AND I DON'T KEEP THE SAME SIZE FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THINGS SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL
FOR I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF TO BEGIN WITH AND BEING SO MANY DIFFERENT SIZES IN A DAY IS VERY CONFUSING IT ISN'T SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT SO YET SAID ALICE
HAD HE BEEN ON DECK HE COULD NO LONGER SO MUCH AS HAVE PRETENDED NOT TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION IT WAS AS PLAIN AS DAY
THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT THOUGHT ALICE TO HERSELF OF THE MUSHROOM SAID THE CATERPILLAR JUST AS IF SHE HAD ASKED IT ALOUD AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT ALICE REMAINED LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MUSHROOM FOR A MINUTE
AND THE SURF THAT WE COULD BOTH SEE AND HEAR FOAMING AND THUNDERING ON THE STEEP BEACH AT LEAST ALTHOUGH THE SUN SHONE BRIGHT AND HOT AND THE SHORE BIRDS WERE FISHING AND CRYING ALL AROUND US
YET YOU FINISHED THE GOOSE WITH THE BONES AND THE BEAK PRAY HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO DO IT IN MY YOUTH SAID HIS FATHER I TOOK TO THE LAW AND ARGUED EACH CASE WITH MY WIFE AND THE MUSCULAR STRENGTH WHICH IT GAVE TO MY JAW HAS LASTED THE REST OF MY LIFE
THAT SINCE I HAD BEEN SO FOOLHARDY AS TO COME ASHORE WITH THESE DESPERADOES THE LEAST I COULD DO WAS TO OVERHEAR THEM AT THEIR COUNCILS AND THAT MY PLAIN AND OBVIOUS DUTY WAS TO DRAW AS CLOSE AS I COULD MANAGE UNDER THE FAVOURABLE AMBUSH OF THE CROUCHING TREES
BUT SILVER FROM THE OTHER BOAT LOOKED SHARPLY OVER AND CALLED OUT TO KNOW IF THAT WERE ME AND FROM THAT MOMENT I BEGAN TO REGRET WHAT I HAD DONE THE CREWS RACED FOR THE BEACH BUT THE BOAT I WAS IN HAVING SOME START AND BEING AT ONCE THE LIGHTER AND THE BETTER MANNED
AND ANOTHER OF THE CREW STOOD FACE TO FACE IN CONVERSATION THE SUN BEAT FULL UPON THEM SILVER HAD THROWN HIS HAT BESIDE HIM ON THE GROUND AND HIS GREAT SMOOTH BLOND FACE
MY LADS SAID HE WE'VE HAD A HOT DAY AND ARE ALL TIRED AND OUT OF SORTS A TURN ASHORE'LL HURT NOBODY THE BOATS ARE STILL IN THE WATER YOU CAN TAKE THE GIGS AND AS MANY AS PLEASE MAY GO ASHORE FOR THE AFTERNOON
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A VERY BAD SIGN FOR UP TO THAT DAY THE MEN HAD GONE BRISKLY AND WILLINGLY ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS BUT THE VERY SIGHT OF THE ISLAND HAD RELAXED THE CORDS OF DISCIPLINE ALL THE WAY IN LONG JOHN STOOD BY THE STEERSMAN AND CONNED THE SHIP
WELL IF I SPEAK BACK PIKES WILL BE GOING IN TWO SHAKES IF I DON'T SILVER WILL SEE THERE'S SOMETHING UNDER THAT AND THE GAME'S UP NOW WE'VE ONLY ONE MAN TO RELY ON AND WHO IS THAT ASKED THE SQUIRE SILVER SIR RETURNED THE CAPTAIN
NOT YOU AS SURE AS GOD SEES ME I'D SOONER LOSE MY HAND IF I TURN AGIN MY DOOTY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A NOISE I HAD FOUND ONE OF THE HONEST HANDS WELL
THAT IT FELT QUITE STRANGE AT FIRST BUT SHE GOT USED TO IT IN A FEW MINUTES AND BEGAN TALKING TO HERSELF AS USUAL COME THERE'S HALF MY PLAN DONE NOW HOW PUZZLING ALL THESE CHANGES ARE I'M NEVER SURE WHAT I'M GOING TO BE FROM ONE MINUTE TO ANOTHER
I CAN SEE YOU'RE TRYING TO INVENT SOMETHING I I'M A LITTLE GIRL SAID ALICE RATHER DOUBTFULLY AS SHE REMEMBERED THE NUMBER OF CHANGES SHE HAD GONE THROUGH THAT DAY A LIKELY STORY INDEED SAID THE PIGEON IN A TONE OF THE DEEPEST CONTEMPT
A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
BUT IF A FELLER KNOWS THE COUNTRY AND KEEPS HIS HEAD LEVEL HE CAN'T LOSE JEFFERSON HAD LOOKED AT SO MANY PROSPECTUSES AND SO MANY PICTURES OF MINES AND PINE TREES AND SMELTERS THAT I THINK HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT HE'D NEVER BEEN IN THE COUNTRY ANYWAY WHAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILES
AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
SO OF COURSE AS SOON AS JEFF MADE THE FORTUNE MYRA HAD HER RESIGNATION IN NEXT MORNING
ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY TO BE A NECESSARY AND UNIVERSAL ADJUNCT OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS THE INSPIRATION OF THE BOOK
JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
WITH A FALSE FRONT THAT STICKS UP ABOVE ITS REAL HEIGHT AND GIVES IT AN AIR AT ONCE RECTANGULAR AND IMPOSING IT IS A FORM OF ARCHITECTURE MUCH USED IN MARIPOSA AND UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRETENTIOUS AND ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF MODERN BUSINESS
I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS GETTING SO MUCH MONEY WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY IT ACTS ON PEOPLE IN THE LARGER CITIES IT SEEMED TO SPOIL ONE'S IDEA OF JEFF THAT COPPER AND ASBESTOS AND BANANA LANDS SHOULD FORM THE GOAL OF HIS THOUGHT WHEN IF HE KNEW IT
YOU MAY FIND THEM ALL THE WAY FROM LAKE SUPERIOR TO THE SEA WITH THE SAME SQUARE STREETS AND THE SAME MAPLE TREES AND THE SAME CHURCHES AND HOTELS AND EVERYWHERE THE SUNSHINE OF THE LAND OF HOPE SIMILARLY THE REVEREND MISTER DRONE IS NOT ONE PERSON BUT ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN
AN EXPERIENCE WHICH HAS LEFT ME WITH A PROFOUND SYMPATHY FOR THE MANY GIFTED AND BRILLIANT MEN WHO ARE COMPELLED TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN THE MOST DREARY THE MOST THANKLESS AND THE WORST PAID PROFESSION IN THE WORLD
WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
HE WOULD SAY AND ANOTHER DAY HE WOULD PAUSE IN THE COURSE OF SHAVING AND ALMOST WHISPER DID YOU EVER SEE THIS ROCKEFELLER IT WAS ONLY BY A SORT OF ACCIDENT THAT I CAME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO JEFFERSON'S SPECULATION THAT NO ONE IN MARIPOSA EVER KNEW OR WILL EVER KNOW NOW
AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
YOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATION
NOR TO CONSTRUCT EVEN THE SMALLEST SECTION OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY THIS HOWEVER IS A FORM OF NATIONAL INGRATITUDE TO WHICH ONE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED IN THIS DOMINION APART FROM MY COLLEGE WORK I HAVE WRITTEN TWO BOOKS ONE CALLED LITERARY LAPSES
I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
LOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITE
IN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
AND NEEDS A TELLER AS FOR MISTER SMITH WITH HIS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY POUNDS HIS HOARSE VOICE HIS LOUD CHECK SUIT
AS GRAVE AS AN OPERATING SURGEON THEN AS I THINK I SAID MISTER SMITH CAME IN EVERY MORNING AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF FLORIDA WATER AND RUMS ESSENCES AND REVIVERS AND RENOVATORS REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE
ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
THERE WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN THAT JEFF WOULD SIZE UP SIDEWAYS AS HE STROPPED THE RAZOR AND IN WHOSE EAR HE WOULD WHISPER I SEE WHERE SAINT LOUIS HAS TOOK FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES OFF CHICAGO AND SO HOLD HIM FASCINATED TO THE END IN THE SAME WAY HE WOULD SAY TO MISTER SMITH
MY PARENTS MIGRATED TO CANADA IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I DECIDED TO GO WITH THEM MY FATHER TOOK UP A FARM NEAR LAKE SIMCOE IN ONTARIO THIS WAS DURING THE HARD TIMES OF CANADIAN FARMING
AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
BUT TO WRITE SOMETHING OUT OF ONE'S OWN MIND WORTH READING FOR ITS OWN SAKE IS AN ARDUOUS CONTRIVANCE ONLY TO BE ACHIEVED IN FORTUNATE MOMENTS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
THEY GIVE IT AWAY AND WHO DO THEY GIVE IT TO WHY TO THOSE AS DON'T WANT IT EVERY TIME THEY GIVE IT TO THESE PROFESSORS AND TO THIS RESEARCH AND THAT AND DO THE POOR GET ANY OF IT NOT A CENT AND NEVER WILL I TELL YOU BOYS CONTINUED JEFF
AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
AND RIGHT AT OUR VERY DOORS YOU COULD SEE AS I SAW THE NIGHT EXPRESS GOING NORTH EVERY EVENING FOR ALL ONE KNEW ROCKEFELLER OR CARNEGIE OR ANYONE MIGHT BE ON IT
I MAY SAY IN PARENTHESES THAT IT WAS A FAVOURITE METHOD IN MARIPOSA IF YOU WANTED TO GET AT THE REAL WORTH OF A MAN TO IMAGINE HIM CLEAN SOLD UP PUT UP FOR AUCTION AS IT WERE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO TEST HIM AND NOW LOOK AT EM JEFF WENT ON
MANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WRITE THESE HUMOROUS NOTHINGS IN IDLE MOMENTS WHEN THE WEARIED BRAIN IS UNABLE TO PERFORM THE SERIOUS LABOURS OF THE ECONOMIST MY OWN EXPERIENCE IS EXACTLY THE OTHER WAY
HE ASKED ME FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HOW MANY BLIND PEOPLE IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL ONE OF THESE BLIND HOMES AND HOW A FELLER COULD GET AHOLD OF THEM
THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSH
I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
SO ALWAYS AFTER THAT I KNEW JUST WHAT THOSE BANANAS WERE BEING GROWN FOR INDEED AFTER THAT THOUGH JEFFERSON NEVER SPOKE OF HIS INTENTIONS DIRECTLY HE SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO BEAR ON THEM
THEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCE
IT WAS PROBABLY IN HIM FROM THE START THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH THINGS AS TRACTION STOCK AND AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS WENT TO HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF MISTER CARNEGIE AND MISTER ROCKEFELLER THE YEARNING TONE OF HIS VOICE MADE IT AS SOFT AS LATHERED SOAP
AND MY FATHER WAS JUST ABLE BY GREAT DILIGENCE TO PAY THE HIRED MEN AND IN YEARS OF PLENTY TO RAISE ENOUGH GRAIN TO HAVE SEED FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S CROP WITHOUT BUYING ANY BY THIS PROCESS MY BROTHERS AND I WERE INEVITABLY DRIVEN OFF THE LAND
AT THE UNIVERSITY I SPENT MY ENTIRE TIME IN THE ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGES LIVING DEAD AND HALF DEAD AND KNEW NOTHING OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN THIS DILIGENT PURSUIT OF WORDS I SPENT ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS OF EACH DAY
IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
AND THEN AND THEN WELL THAT'S JUST THE QUEER THING ABOUT THE MINING BUSINESS WHY SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IT SEEMED THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRE TO THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET THAT THEY HAD STRUCK A VEIN OF SILVER IN THE NORTHERN STAR AS THICK AS A SIDEWALK
WHILE I AM ABLE TO MIX WITH THE POORER OF THE BUSINESS MEN OF THE CITY ON TERMS OF SOMETHING LIKE EQUALITY IN POINT OF LEISURE I ENJOY MORE IN THE FOUR CORNERS OF A SINGLE YEAR THAN A BUSINESS MAN KNOWS IN HIS WHOLE LIFE I THUS HAVE WHAT THE BUSINESS MAN CAN NEVER ENJOY
JEFF RECEIVED THE FIRST BIG PACKET OF STUFF FROM THE CUBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WITH COLOURED PICTURES OF CUBA AND FIELDS OF BANANAS AND HACIENDAS AND INSURRECTOS WITH MACHETES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY HEARD OF HIM SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FOR A MODEST MAN LIKE JEFFERSON TO SAY HOW
AND THE OTHER NONSENSE NOVELS EACH OF THESE IS PUBLISHED BY JOHN LANE LONDON AND NEW YORK AND EITHER OF THEM CAN BE OBTAINED ABSURD THOUGH IT SOUNDS FOR THE MERE SUM OF THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE ANY READER OF THIS PREFACE FOR EXAMPLE RIDICULOUS THOUGH IT APPEARS
THERE WERE NO BOYS PRESENT BUT IN MARIPOSA ALL REALLY IMPORTANT SPEECHES ARE ADDRESSED TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE OF BOYS I TELL YOU IF I WAS TO MAKE A MILLION OUT OF THIS CUBEY I'D GIVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE POOR YES SIR DIVIDE IT UP INTO A HUNDRED LOTS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HADN'T NOTHING
BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
WHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
AFTER THIS NO NEW IDEAS CAN BE IMPARTED TO HIM FROM THIS TIME AND SINCE MY MARRIAGE WHICH HAD OCCURRED AT THIS PERIOD I HAVE BELONGED TO THE STAFF OF MC GILL UNIVERSITY FIRST AS LECTURER IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LATER AS HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH PUT THE REST OF HIS WIFE'S MONEY INTO TEMISKAMING COMMON AND LAWYER MACARTNEY GOT THE FEVER TOO AND PUT EVERY CENT THAT HIS SISTER POSSESSED INTO TULIP PREFERRED AND EVEN WHEN YOUNG FIZZLECHIP SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE MARIPOSA HOUSE MISTER GINGHAM BURIED HIM IN A CASKET WITH SILVER HANDLES
BANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURES
THEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCE
TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
THAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
AND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ON
THAT IS INDUCED BY HONEST MANUAL TOIL I WAS EDUCATED AT UPPER CANADA COLLEGE TORONTO OF WHICH I WAS HEAD BOY IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FROM THERE I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO WHERE I GRADUATED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE
I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOO
FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
THEY ALL WENT IN OR ALL EXCEPT MISTER SMITH YOU SEE MISTER SMITH HAD COME DOWN FROM THERE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ROCKS AND MINING AND CANOES AND THE NORTH COUNTRY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO EAT FLOUR BAKED DAMPERS UNDER THE LEE SIDE OF A CANOE PROPPED AMONG THE UNDERBRUSH
THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
TO AN ONLOOKER IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM SO SIMPLE I NEVER KNEW THE MEANNESS THE TRICKERY OF THE MINING BUSINESS THE SHEER OBSTINATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIGGER CAPITALISTS NOT TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY MIGHT TILL I HEARD THE ACCOUNTS OF JEFF'S DIFFERENT MINES TAKE THE CASE OF CORONA JEWEL
BLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAID
I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
ELSE HOW WAS IT THAT HENRY MULLINS MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SELLING A DRAFT FOR FORTY THOUSAND ON NEW YORK AND WHY WAS IT THAT MISTER SMITH WOULDN'T PAY BILLY THE DESK CLERK HIS BACK WAGES WHEN HE WANTED TO PUT IT INTO CUBA OH YES SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE SEEN IT
AND THAT SPREAD ROUND HIM A KIND OF HALO OF WEALTH AND MYSTERY AND OUTLANDISHNESS OH SOMETHING SPANISH PERHAPS YOU'VE FELT IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANYHOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND YELLOW FEVER AND WHAT THE NEGROES WERE LIKE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
IN OTHER WORDS I WAS WHAT IS CALLED A DISTINGUISHED GRADUATE AND AS SUCH I TOOK TO SCHOOL TEACHING AS THE ONLY TRADE I COULD FIND THAT NEED NEITHER EXPERIENCE NOR INTELLECT I SPENT MY TIME FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE TO EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE ON THE STAFF OF UPPER CANADA COLLEGE
A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
THE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSED
COULD WALK INTO A BOOKSTORE AND BUY BOTH OF THESE BOOKS FOR SEVEN SHILLINGS YET THESE WORKS ARE OF SO HUMOROUS A CHARACTER THAT FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO PRINT THEM THE COMPOSITORS FELL BACK FROM THEIR TASK SUFFOCATED WITH LAUGHTER AND GASPING FOR AIR
WITHIN A FORTNIGHT THEY PUT A PARTITION DOWN ROBERTSON'S COAL AND WOOD OFFICE AND OPENED THE MARIPOSA MINING EXCHANGE AND JUST ABOUT EVERY MAN ON THE MAIN STREET STARTED BUYING SCRIP THEN PRESENTLY YOUNG FIZZLECHIP WHO HAD BEEN TELLER IN MULLINS'S BANK AND THAT EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT A WORTHLESS JACKASS BEFORE
THERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HER
IF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACY
A FEW DAYS LATER HE GOT A LETTER FROM THE CUBAN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK ACCEPTING THE MONEY STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT A SINGLE QUESTION AND WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING MORE OF JOHNSON EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF JEFF'S THEY WROTE MOST HANDSOMELY ANY FRIENDS OF JEFF'S WERE FRIENDS OF CUBA
THE FAULT LIES RATHER WITH AN ART THAT IS DEFICIENT THAN IN AN AFFECTION THAT IS WANTING
AND PEOPLE WERE JUST CLUTCHING FOR THEM THEN AT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG OYSTER SUPPER IN SMITH'S CAFF WITH SPEECHES AND THE MARIPOSA BAND OUTSIDE AND THE QUEER THING WAS THAT THE VERY NEXT AFTERNOON WAS THE FUNERAL OF YOUNG FIZZLECHIP
THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET HER AND SHE SAYS NOW THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING SHE HATES IT'S THE STAGE AND SHE CAN'T SEE HOW THE ACTRESSES PUT UP WITH IT ANYWAY THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD
THEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT
THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH
AN ABILITY TO THINK AND WHAT IS STILL BETTER TO STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER FOR MONTHS AT A TIME I HAVE WRITTEN A NUMBER OF THINGS IN CONNECTION WITH MY COLLEGE LIFE A BOOK ON POLITICAL SCIENCE AND MANY ESSAYS MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND SO ON
THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
AND JEFF WENT BACK TO THE SHOP SO QUIET HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL THAT IS STRICKEN THROUGH HOW QUIET IT SEEMS TO MOVE
IN REGARD TO THE PRESENT WORK I MUST DISCLAIM AT ONCE ALL INTENTIONS OF TRYING TO DO ANYTHING SO RIDICULOUSLY EASY AS WRITING ABOUT A REAL PLACE AND REAL PEOPLE MARIPOSA IS NOT A REAL TOWN ON THE CONTRARY IT IS ABOUT SEVENTY OR EIGHTY OF THEM
A LAND OF HOPE AND SUNSHINE WHERE LITTLE TOWNS SPREAD THEIR SQUARE STREETS AND THEIR TRIM MAPLE TREES BESIDE PLACID LAKES ALMOST WITHIN ECHO OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST IS LARGE ENOUGH
SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
AND WHEN SHE ACTED PORTIA IN THE TRIAL SCENE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONCERT
EVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEED
I KNOW NO WAY IN WHICH A WRITER MAY MORE FITTINGLY INTRODUCE HIS WORK TO THE PUBLIC THAN BY GIVING A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHO AND WHAT HE IS BY THIS MEANS SOME OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE IS VERY PROPERLY SHIFTED TO THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS LIFE
AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR IT SETS IN VIOLENT AGITATION A COILED SPRING UP ABOVE AND A BELL THAT ALMOST RINGS INSIDE THERE ARE TWO SHAVING CHAIRS OF THE HEAVIER OR ELECTROCUTION PATTERN
EXACTLY THE KIND OF A HEAD A MAN NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE A HAUL OR A CLEAN UP IT WAS EVIDENTLY SIMPLY A MATTER OF THE HEAD AND AS FAR AS ONE COULD JUDGE JEFF'S OWN WAS THE VERY TYPE REQUIRED I DON'T KNOW JUST AT WHAT TIME OR HOW JEFFERSON FIRST BEGAN HIS SPECULATIVE ENTERPRISES
HE'D HAVE HAD HER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT MIND YOU I DON'T MEAN THAT MYRA WAS MERELY FLIPPANT AND WORTHLESS NOT AT ALL SHE WAS A GIRL WITH ANY AMOUNT OF TALENT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER RECITE THE RAVEN AT THE METHODIST SOCIAL SIMPLY GENIUS
AND BY MEANS OF THIS AND SOME TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT BY MC GILL UNIVERSITY I SURVIVED UNTIL I TOOK THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN NINETEEN O THREE THE MEANING OF THIS DEGREE IS THAT THE RECIPIENT OF INSTRUCTION IS EXAMINED FOR THE LAST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND IS PRONOUNCED COMPLETELY FULL
AND BECOME A LEADING ACTRESS BUT AS I SAID THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION COUNTED A LOT FOR JEFF THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO GET THAT SORT OF THING IT COMES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH BRAINS YOU KNOW ARE RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS WHY OF COURSE WITHIN A WEEK FROM THIS
JEFF LAID DOWN WHAT HE WAS READING AND STARTED TO TALK ABOUT CARNEGIE THIS CARNEGIE I BET YOU WOULD BE WORTH SAID JEFF CLOSING UP HIS EYES IN CALCULATION AS MUCH AS PERHAPS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WAS TO SELL HIM UP
CAME BACK FROM THE COBALT COUNTRY WITH A FORTUNE AND LOAFED ROUND IN THE MARIPOSA HOUSE IN ENGLISH KHAKI AND A HORIZONTAL HAT DRUNK ALL THE TIME
THAT WAS JEFF'S MONEY PART OF IT MULLINS GOT THE TELEGRAM FROM A BROKER OR SOMEONE AND HE SHOWED IT TO JEFF JUST AS HE WAS GOING UP THE STREET WITH AN ESTATE AGENT TO LOOK AT A BIG EMPTY LOT ON THE HILL BEHIND THE TOWN THE VERY PLACE FOR THESE INCURABLES
THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
I AM ABLE TO REGARD MYSELF AS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE THE EMOLUMENT IS SO HIGH AS TO PLACE ME DISTINCTLY ABOVE THE POLICEMEN POSTMEN STREET CAR CONDUCTORS AND OTHER SALARIED OFFICIALS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
MULLINS AND BAGSHAW AND JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH AND THE REST ARE IT IS TRUE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE BUT I HAVE KNOWN THEM IN SUCH A VARIETY OF FORMS WITH SUCH ALTERNATIONS OF TALL AND SHORT DARK AND FAIR THAT INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD HAVE MUCH ADO TO KNOW THEM
THE RAZOR WOULD GO SLOWER AND SLOWER AND PAUSE AND STOP MOVE AND PAUSE AGAIN TILL THE SHAVE DIED AWAY INTO THE MERE DROWSE OF CONVERSATION AT SUCH HOURS THE MARIPOSA BARBER SHOP WOULD BECOME A VERY PALACE OF SLUMBER
AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
I LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAY
AND IN LESS THAN NO TIME THERE WASN'T STANDING ROOM IN THE BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN SMITH'S HOTEL THEY HAD THREE EXTRA BARKEEPERS WORKING ON THE LAGER BEER PUMPS
YOU REMEMBER THE CUBAN LAND FRAUDS IN NEW YORK AND PORFORIO GOMEZ SHOOTING THE DETECTIVE AND HIM AND MAXIMO MOREZ GETTING CLEAR AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHY EVEN IN THE CITY PAPERS IT ONLY FILLED AN INCH OR TWO OF TYPE AND ANYWAY THE NAMES WERE HARD TO REMEMBER
AND THEN IN THE OTHER YOU SEE IN MARIPOSA SHAVING ISN'T THE HURRIED PERFUNCTORY THING THAT IT IS IN THE CITY A SHAVE IS LOOKED UPON AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND LASTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE MORNING HOURS PERHAPS THERE WAS A SEMBLANCE OF HASTE ABOUT IT
WITH ONE HAND ON HIS KNEE AND A DOG ONE OF THOSE REGULAR MINING DOGS AT HIS FEET AND A LOOK OF PIERCING INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FACE THAT WOULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I SAY THAT THE RECOGNITION MEANT A LOT TO JEFF FOR ITS OWN SAKE
AND BESIDE IT JEFF WOULD SIT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON AND THE PAPER SPREAD OUT READING ABOUT CARNEGIE AND ROCKEFELLER NEAR HIM BUT AWAY FROM THE TABLE WAS THE WOMAN DOING NEEDLEWORK AND MYRA WHEN SHE WASN'T WORKING IN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS THERE TOO WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE READING MARIE CORELLI
I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
ALL MONEY THEY MIGHT SEND WOULD BE TREATED JUST AS JEFF'S WOULD BE TREATED ONE REASON PERHAPS WHY JEFF DIDN'T GIVE UP SHAVING WAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO TALK ABOUT CUBA
AND THAT TOUCHES YOU NO THEY ASKED NO GUARANTEE JUST SEND THE MONEY WHETHER BY EXPRESS ORDER OR BY BANK DRAFT OR CHEQUE THEY LEFT THAT ENTIRELY TO ONESELF AS A MATTER BETWEEN CUBAN GENTLEMEN AND THEY WERE QUITE FRANK ABOUT THEIR ENTERPRISE
I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT ALL ROUND THE BRITISH EMPIRE DELIVERING ADDRESSES ON IMPERIAL ORGANIZATION WHEN I STATE THAT THESE LECTURES WERE FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA THE BANANA RIOTS IN TRINIDAD AND THE TURCO ITALIAN WAR
AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
THEY SAID COMMONLY IN MARIPOSA THAT JEFF MADE MONEY OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP HE MAY HAVE AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THAT TURNED HIS MIND TO INVESTMENT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD A SHAVE COST FIVE CENTS AND A HAIR CUT FIFTEEN OR THE TWO IF YOU LIKED FOR A QUARTER
A FELLER COULD GET ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A SHOWING
AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
AND SO DOES MISTER PALMER TOO I AM SURE THOUGH WE COULD NOT GET HIM TO OWN IT LAST NIGHT MISSUS PALMER'S INFORMATION RESPECTING WILLOUGHBY WAS NOT VERY MATERIAL BUT ANY TESTIMONY IN HIS FAVOUR HOWEVER SMALL WAS PLEASING TO HER
I FELT SURE THAT YOU WAS ANGRY WITH ME AND HAVE BEEN QUARRELLING WITH MYSELF EVER SINCE FOR HAVING TOOK SUCH A LIBERTY AS TO TROUBLE YOU WITH MY AFFAIRS BUT I AM VERY GLAD TO FIND IT WAS ONLY MY OWN FANCY AND THAT YOU REALLY DO NOT BLAME ME
OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY
I HAVE THE WHIP HAND OF YOU CHARLOTTE LAUGHED HEARTILY TO THINK THAT HER HUSBAND COULD NOT GET RID OF HER AND EXULTINGLY SAID SHE DID NOT CARE HOW CROSS HE WAS TO HER AS THEY MUST LIVE TOGETHER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE
TO THIS ELINOR HAD NO ANSWER TO MAKE AND DID NOT ATTEMPT ANY ARE YOU ILL MISS DASHWOOD YOU SEEM LOW YOU DON'T SPEAK SURE YOU AN'T WELL I NEVER WAS IN BETTER HEALTH
IT WAS TREATED BY THE FORMER WITH CALMNESS AND CAUTION AND DISMISSED AS SOON AS CIVILITY WOULD ALLOW FOR SHE FELT SUCH CONVERSATIONS TO BE AN INDULGENCE WHICH LUCY DID NOT DESERVE AND WHICH WERE DANGEROUS TO HERSELF
NO ANSWERED ELINOR WITH A SMILE WHICH CONCEALED VERY AGITATED FEELINGS ON SUCH A SUBJECT I CERTAINLY WILL NOT YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT MY OPINION WOULD HAVE NO WEIGHT WITH YOU UNLESS IT WERE ON THE SIDE OF YOUR WISHES
YOUR BROTHER MIGHT BE PERSUADED TO GIVE HIM NORLAND LIVING WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS A VERY GOOD ONE AND THE PRESENT INCUMBENT NOT LIKELY TO LIVE A GREAT WHILE THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR US TO MARRY UPON
IT WAS A VERY AWKWARD MOMENT AND THE COUNTENANCE OF EACH SHEWED THAT IT WAS SO THEY ALL LOOKED EXCEEDINGLY FOOLISH AND EDWARD SEEMED TO HAVE AS GREAT AN INCLINATION TO WALK OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN AS TO ADVANCE FARTHER INTO IT
NO PRIDE NO HAUTEUR AND YOUR SISTER JUST THE SAME ALL SWEETNESS AND AFFABILITY ELINOR WISHED TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT LUCY STILL PRESSED HER TO OWN THAT SHE HAD REASON FOR HER HAPPINESS AND ELINOR WAS OBLIGED TO GO ON
SHE HAD FOUND IN HER EVERY THING THAT COULD TEND TO MAKE A FARTHER CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FAMILIES UNDESIRABLE
IF WE CAN PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO ALL THIS SAID LADY RUSSELL LOOKING OVER HER PAPER MUCH MAY BE DONE IF HE WILL ADOPT THESE REGULATIONS IN SEVEN YEARS HE WILL BE CLEAR AND I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM AND ELIZABETH
TO WHICH BOTH OF THEM SUBMITTED WITHOUT ANY RELUCTANCE FOR NOTHING HAD BEEN SAID ON EITHER SIDE TO MAKE THEM DISLIKE EACH OTHER LESS THAN THEY HAD DONE BEFORE AND ELINOR SAT DOWN TO THE CARD TABLE WITH THE MELANCHOLY PERSUASION THAT EDWARD WAS NOT ONLY WITHOUT AFFECTION FOR THE PERSON WHO WAS TO BE HIS WIFE
AND SO WE BEGAN TALKING OF MY BROTHER AND SISTER AND ONE THING AND ANOTHER AND I SAID TO HIM SO COLONEL THERE IS A NEW FAMILY COME TO BARTON COTTAGE I HEAR
ASKED ELINOR NOT AT ALL I NEVER SAW HIM BUT I FANCY HE IS VERY UNLIKE HIS BROTHER SILLY AND A GREAT COXCOMB A GREAT COXCOMB REPEATED MISS STEELE
TO COMPREHEND ALL THE DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST HAVE PERPLEXED THE ENGAGEMENT AND RETARDED THE MARRIAGE OF EDWARD AND HERSELF HAD HE BEEN OTHERWISE FREE AND SHE HAD SEEN ALMOST ENOUGH TO BE THANKFUL FOR HER OWN SAKE
AND WOULD NOT SAY A WORD AND ALMOST EVERY THING THAT WAS SAID PROCEEDED FROM ELINOR
IT WAS A MUCH SAFER PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN IN HIS PREDICAMENT
MAMA SAYS HE WAS IN LOVE WITH YOUR SISTER TOO I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A GREAT COMPLIMENT IF HE WAS FOR HE HARDLY EVER FALLS IN LOVE WITH ANY BODY IS MISTER WILLOUGHBY MUCH KNOWN IN YOUR PART OF SOMERSETSHIRE
FOR AT HER PARTICULAR DESIRE LADY MIDDLETON SET HER DOWN IN BERKELEY STREET ON THE CHANCE OF SEEING ELINOR ALONE TO TELL HER HOW HAPPY SHE WAS THE CHANCE PROVED A LUCKY ONE
BUT IF HE WERE EVER SO MUCH THERE
AND I AM SO GLAD YOUR SISTER IS GOING TO BE WELL MARRIED I HOPE YOU WILL BE A GREAT DEAL AT COMBE MAGNA IT IS A SWEET PLACE BY ALL ACCOUNTS YOU HAVE BEEN LONG ACQUAINTED WITH COLONEL BRANDON HAVE NOT YOU YES
OTHERWISE LONDON WOULD HAVE NO CHARMS FOR ME I HAVE NOT SPIRITS FOR IT ELINOR WAS SOON CALLED TO THE CARD TABLE BY THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST RUBBER AND THE CONFIDENTIAL DISCOURSE OF THE TWO LADIES WAS THEREFORE AT AN END
BUT TO SEE IT IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS A TRIAL OF FORTITUDE WHICH STRONGER HEADS THAN SIR WALTER'S HAVE FOUND TOO MUCH KELLYNCH HALL WAS TO BE LET THIS HOWEVER WAS A PROFOUND SECRET NOT TO BE BREATHED BEYOND THEIR OWN CIRCLE
KELLYNCH HALL AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE OF DOUBT AND INDECISION THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT THERE HAD BEEN THREE ALTERNATIVES LONDON BATH
WE SEEM SO BESET WITH DIFFICULTIES ON EVERY SIDE THAT THOUGH IT WOULD MAKE US MISERABLE FOR A TIME WE SHOULD BE HAPPIER PERHAPS IN THE END
THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE GLAD TO SEE ME THEY ARE SUCH CHARMING WOMEN
EDWARD WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK AND IT WAS TO NOTICE MARIANNE'S ALTERED LOOKS AND EXPRESS HIS FEAR OF HER NOT FINDING LONDON AGREE WITH HER OH DON'T THINK OF ME SHE REPLIED WITH SPIRITED EARNESTNESS
LEST THEY MIGHT PROVOKE EACH OTHER TO AN UNSUITABLE INCREASE OF EASE AND UNRESERVE AND WAS EVEN PARTLY DETERMINED NEVER TO MENTION THE SUBJECT AGAIN ANOTHER PAUSE THEREFORE OF MANY MINUTES DURATION SUCCEEDED THIS SPEECH
BUT ELINOR HAD MORE TO DO
AND I REALLY BELIEVE HE HAS THE MOST DELICATE CONSCIENCE IN THE WORLD THE MOST SCRUPULOUS IN PERFORMING EVERY ENGAGEMENT HOWEVER MINUTE
THERE IS STILL MORE DUE TO THE CHARACTER OF AN HONEST MAN
HER MANNERS GAVE SOME RE ASSURANCE TO EDWARD AND HE HAD COURAGE ENOUGH TO SIT DOWN BUT HIS EMBARRASSMENT STILL EXCEEDED THAT OF THE LADIES IN A PROPORTION WHICH THE CASE RENDERED REASONABLE THOUGH HIS SEX MIGHT MAKE IT RARE
AND REPLIED THIS COMPLIMENT WOULD EFFECTUALLY FRIGHTEN ME FROM GIVING ANY OPINION ON THE SUBJECT HAD I FORMED ONE IT RAISES MY INFLUENCE MUCH TOO HIGH THE POWER OF DIVIDING TWO PEOPLE SO TENDERLY ATTACHED IS TOO MUCH FOR AN INDIFFERENT PERSON
IT WILL BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL MY LOVE APPLYING TO HER HUSBAND DON'T YOU LONG TO HAVE THE MISS DASHWOODS COME TO CLEVELAND CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A SNEER I CAME INTO DEVONSHIRE WITH NO OTHER VIEW
LUCY HERE LOOKED UP BUT ELINOR WAS CAREFUL IN GUARDING HER COUNTENANCE FROM EVERY EXPRESSION THAT COULD GIVE HER WORDS A SUSPICIOUS TENDENCY EDWARD'S LOVE FOR ME SAID LUCY HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL PUT TO THE TEST BY OUR LONG
GOING SO SOON SAID MARIANNE MY DEAR EDWARD THIS MUST NOT BE AND DRAWING HIM A LITTLE ASIDE SHE WHISPERED HER PERSUASION THAT LUCY COULD NOT STAY MUCH LONGER
FOR I WAS SOMEHOW OR OTHER AFRAID I HAD OFFENDED YOU BY WHAT I TOLD YOU THAT MONDAY OFFENDED ME HOW COULD YOU SUPPOSE SO BELIEVE ME AND ELINOR SPOKE IT WITH THE TRUEST SINCERITY
AND THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTIES AT ALL TO WHAT I USED TO THINK
THAT MUST BE RECOMMENDATION ENOUGH TO HER HUSBAND BUT MISSUS JOHN DASHWOOD WOULD NOT MUCH APPROVE OF EDWARD'S GOING INTO ORDERS THEN I RATHER SUSPECT THAT MY INTEREST WOULD DO VERY LITTLE
SHE WOULD NOT BE FRIGHTENED FROM PAYING HIM THOSE ATTENTIONS WHICH AS A FRIEND AND ALMOST A RELATION WERE HIS DUE BY THE OBSERVANT EYES OF LUCY THOUGH SHE SOON PERCEIVED THEM TO BE NARROWLY WATCHING HER
LUCY LOOKED AT ELINOR AGAIN AND WAS SILENT
BUT THE OBJECT OF DISTANT CIVILITY FROM SITUATION MISSUS CLAY WAS IN LADY RUSSELL'S ESTIMATE
ELINOR WAS AGAIN OBLIGED TO DECLINE HER INVITATION AND BY CHANGING THE SUBJECT PUT A STOP TO HER ENTREATIES SHE THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT AS THEY LIVED IN THE SAME COUNTY
I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO PUT AN END TO YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH EDWARD FERRARS IT WILL BE MORE FOR THE HAPPINESS OF BOTH OF YOU I SHOULD RESOLVE UPON DOING IT IMMEDIATELY ELINOR BLUSHED FOR THE INSINCERITY OF EDWARD'S FUTURE WIFE
ELINOR BLUSHED IN SPITE OF HERSELF LUCY BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED ANGRILY AT HER SISTER A MUTUAL SILENCE TOOK PLACE FOR SOME TIME LUCY FIRST PUT AN END TO IT BY SAYING IN A LOWER TONE
TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT ITS MORE CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM KELLYNCH ONLY FIFTY MILES AND LADY RUSSELL'S SPENDING SOME PART OF EVERY WINTER THERE AND TO THE VERY GREAT SATISFACTION OF LADY RUSSELL
MISTER BRANDON WAS VERY WELL I HOPE OH YES QUITE WELL AND SO FULL OF YOUR PRAISES HE DID NOTHING BUT SAY FINE THINGS OF YOU I AM FLATTERED BY HIS COMMENDATION
WOULD BE HARDLY LESS PAINFUL THAN OF BOTH AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST OF LADY RUSSELL'S TOO GENTLE REDUCTIONS HOW ANNE'S MORE RIGID REQUISITIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE LADY RUSSELL'S HAD NO SUCCESS AT ALL
ELIZABETH HAD BEEN LATELY FORMING AN INTIMACY WHICH SHE WISHED TO SEE INTERRUPTED IT WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER SHEPHERD WHO HAD RETURNED AFTER AN UNPROSPEROUS MARRIAGE TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE WITH THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF TWO CHILDREN
SIR WALTER COULD NOT HAVE BORNE THE DEGRADATION OF BEING KNOWN TO DESIGN LETTING HIS HOUSE MISTER SHEPHERD HAD ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD ADVERTISE BUT NEVER DARED APPROACH IT AGAIN SIR WALTER SPURNED THE IDEA OF ITS BEING OFFERED IN ANY MANNER
AGAIN THEY ALL SAT DOWN AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO ALL WERE SILENT WHILE MARIANNE WAS LOOKING WITH THE MOST SPEAKING TENDERNESS SOMETIMES AT EDWARD AND SOMETIMES AT ELINOR REGRETTING ONLY THAT THEIR DELIGHT IN EACH OTHER SHOULD BE CHECKED BY LUCY'S UNWELCOME PRESENCE
FROM THIS TIME THE SUBJECT WAS NEVER REVIVED BY ELINOR AND WHEN ENTERED ON BY LUCY WHO SELDOM MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY OF INTRODUCING IT AND WAS PARTICULARLY CAREFUL TO INFORM HER CONFIDANTE OF HER HAPPINESS WHENEVER SHE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM EDWARD
OR TO ALLOW HER TO DERIVE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM A PREFERENCE ONLY GIVEN HER BECAUSE HER REAL SITUATION WAS UNKNOWN BUT THAT IT WAS SO HAD NOT ONLY BEEN DECLARED BY LUCY'S EYES AT THE TIME BUT WAS DECLARED OVER AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING MORE OPENLY
ELINOR WAS PREVENTED FROM MAKING ANY REPLY TO THIS CIVIL TRIUMPH BY THE DOOR'S BEING THROWN OPEN THE SERVANT'S ANNOUNCING MISTER FERRARS AND EDWARD'S IMMEDIATELY WALKING IN
THE MOTIVE WAS TOO COMMON TO BE WONDERED AT
SHE WAS A BENEVOLENT CHARITABLE GOOD WOMAN AND CAPABLE OF STRONG ATTACHMENTS MOST CORRECT IN HER CONDUCT STRICT IN HER NOTIONS OF DECORUM AND WITH MANNERS THAT WERE HELD A STANDARD OF GOOD BREEDING
WHOSE FIRST VIEWS ON THE PROJECTED CHANGE HAD BEEN FOR BATH SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH WERE INDUCED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD LOSE NEITHER CONSEQUENCE NOR ENJOYMENT BY SETTLING THERE LADY RUSSELL FELT OBLIGED TO OPPOSE HER DEAR ANNE'S KNOWN WISHES
FOR LADY MIDDLETON'S DELIGHTED WITH MISSUS DASHWOOD SO WE SHALL BE A GOOD DEAL IN HARLEY STREET I DARE SAY AND EDWARD SPENDS HALF HIS TIME WITH HIS SISTER BESIDES LADY MIDDLETON AND MISSUS FERRARS WILL VISIT NOW
WHOSE EAR HAD CAUGHT THOSE WORDS BY A SUDDEN PAUSE IN MARIANNE'S MUSIC
AND THANK HEAVEN YOU ARE WHAT YOU ALWAYS WERE SHE PAUSED NO ONE SPOKE
PERHAPS MISS MARIANNE CRIED LUCY EAGER TO TAKE SOME REVENGE ON HER
IF YOU COULD BE SUPPOSED TO BE BIASED IN ANY RESPECT BY YOUR OWN FEELINGS YOUR OPINION WOULD NOT BE WORTH HAVING ELINOR THOUGHT IT WISEST TO MAKE NO ANSWER TO THIS
THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE IN ITS UNPLEASANTEST FORM WHICH THEY WOULD EACH HAVE BEEN MOST ANXIOUS TO AVOID HAD FALLEN ON THEM THEY WERE NOT ONLY ALL THREE TOGETHER BUT WERE TOGETHER WITHOUT THE RELIEF OF ANY OTHER PERSON
HE SAID IN CONFESSING HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT SIR WALTER COULD MATERIALLY ALTER HIS STYLE OF LIVING
A GREAT WHILE EVER SINCE MY SISTER MARRIED HE WAS A PARTICULAR FRIEND OF SIR JOHN'S I BELIEVE SHE ADDED IN A LOW VOICE
ALL ABOUT IT I ASSURE YOU AND I ADMIRE YOUR TASTE VERY MUCH
BUT THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN THE CHANCE OF BEING TOLERABLY HAPPY IN MARRIAGE WHICH SINCERE AFFECTION ON HER SIDE WOULD HAVE GIVEN FOR SELF INTEREST ALONE COULD INDUCE A WOMAN TO KEEP A MAN TO AN ENGAGEMENT OF WHICH SHE SEEMED SO THOROUGHLY AWARE THAT HE WAS WEARY
WHICH IS A MELANCHOLY AND SHOCKING EXTREMITY IS HER SON DETERMINED TO SUBMIT TO THIS AND TO ALL THE TEDIOUSNESS OF THE MANY YEARS OF SUSPENSE IN WHICH IT MAY INVOLVE YOU RATHER THAN RUN THE RISK OF HER DISPLEASURE FOR A WHILE BY OWNING THE TRUTH
TIS BECAUSE YOU ARE AN INDIFFERENT PERSON SAID LUCY WITH SOME PIQUE AND LAYING A PARTICULAR STRESS ON THOSE WORDS THAT YOUR JUDGMENT MIGHT JUSTLY HAVE SUCH WEIGHT WITH ME
I ASSURE YOU I HEARD OF IT IN MY WAY THROUGH TOWN MY DEAR MISSUS PALMER UPON MY HONOUR I DID I MET COLONEL BRANDON MONDAY MORNING IN BOND STREET JUST BEFORE WE LEFT TOWN AND HE TOLD ME OF IT DIRECTLY YOU SURPRISE ME VERY MUCH
HER PLEASURE IN SEEING HIM WAS LIKE EVERY OTHER OF HER FEELINGS STRONG IN ITSELF AND STRONGLY SPOKEN SHE MET HIM WITH A HAND THAT WOULD BE TAKEN AND A VOICE THAT EXPRESSED THE AFFECTION OF A SISTER
IT IS BUT NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER AS WELL AS OURSELVES MARIANNE LOOKED AT HER STEADILY AND SAID
DON'T PALM ALL YOUR ABUSES OF LANGUAGES UPON ME
FOR IT IS SO BAD A DAY I WAS AFRAID YOU MIGHT NOT COME WHICH WOULD BE A SHOCKING THING
SAID MISTER PALMER MARIANNE REMAINED PERFECTLY SILENT THOUGH HER COUNTENANCE BETRAYED HER INTEREST IN WHAT WAS SAID IS IT VERY UGLY
WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S RETRENCHING AND WHO WAS PERFECTLY PERSUADED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE WITHOUT A CHANGE OF ABODE
ALL THIS THOUGHT ELINOR IS VERY PRETTY BUT IT CAN IMPOSE UPON NEITHER OF US BUT WHAT SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ARE YOUR VIEWS OR HAVE YOU NONE BUT THAT OF WAITING FOR MISSUS FERRARS'S DEATH
AND WHAT DID THE COLONEL SAY
WOULD VERY LIKELY SECURE EVERY THING TO ROBERT AND THE IDEA OF THAT FOR EDWARD'S SAKE FRIGHTENS AWAY ALL MY INCLINATION FOR HASTY MEASURES AND FOR YOUR OWN SAKE TOO OR YOU ARE CARRYING YOUR DISINTERESTEDNESS BEYOND REASON
AND ANCIENT DIGNITY TO SUPPORT IN ANY OTHER PLACE SIR WALTER MIGHT JUDGE FOR HIMSELF AND WOULD BE LOOKED UP TO AS REGULATING THE MODES OF LIFE IN WHATEVER WAY HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT
ALWAYS OUT OF HUMOUR ELINOR WAS NOT INCLINED AFTER A LITTLE OBSERVATION TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR BEING SO GENUINELY AND UNAFFECTEDLY ILL NATURED OR ILL BRED AS HE WISHED TO APPEAR HIS TEMPER MIGHT
SAID EDWARD WILLING TO SAY ANY THING THAT MIGHT INTRODUCE ANOTHER SUBJECT NOT AT ALL
AND FROM OUR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS IN LIFE FROM HIS BEING SO MUCH MORE IN THE WORLD THAN ME AND OUR CONTINUAL SEPARATION
TO LIVE NO LONGER WITH THE DECENCIES EVEN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN NO HE WOULD SOONER QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AT ONCE THAN REMAIN IN IT ON SUCH DISGRACEFUL TERMS QUIT KELLYNCH HALL THE HINT WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN UP BY MISTER SHEPHERD
RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER THAN BECAUSE ELIZABETH DESERVED IT SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION
THOUGH MARIANNE WAS THEN GIVING THEM THE POWERFUL PROTECTION OF A VERY MAGNIFICENT CONCERTO I WILL HONESTLY TELL YOU OF ONE SCHEME WHICH HAS LATELY COME INTO MY HEAD FOR BRINGING MATTERS TO BEAR
I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE IT OF ALL THINGS THE WESTONS WILL BE WITH US AND IT WILL BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL YOU CANNOT THINK WHAT A SWEET PLACE CLEVELAND IS AND WE ARE SO GAY NOW FOR MISTER PALMER IS ALWAYS GOING ABOUT THE COUNTRY CANVASSING AGAINST THE ELECTION
AND IT IS SINGULARITY WHICH OFTEN MAKES THE WORST PART OF OUR SUFFERING AS IT ALWAYS DOES OF OUR CONDUCT I HAVE GREAT HOPE OF PREVAILING WE MUST BE SERIOUS AND DECIDED FOR AFTER ALL THE PERSON WHO HAS CONTRACTED DEBTS MUST PAY THEM
SHE WANTED IT TO BE PRESCRIBED AND FELT AS A DUTY SHE RATED LADY RUSSELL'S INFLUENCE HIGHLY AND AS TO THE SEVERE DEGREE OF SELF DENIAL WHICH HER OWN CONSCIENCE PROMPTED SHE BELIEVED THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE MORE DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING THEM TO A COMPLETE THAN TO HALF A REFORMATION
I AM GLAD OF IT WITH ALL MY HEART BUT REALLY YOU DID NOT LOOK IT
WITH ALMOST EVERY OTHER MAN IN THE WORLD IT WOULD BE AN ALARMING PROSPECT BUT EDWARD'S AFFECTION AND CONSTANCY NOTHING CAN DEPRIVE ME OF I KNOW THAT CONVICTION MUST BE EVERY THING TO YOU AND HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORTED BY THE SAME TRUST IN YOUR'S
AND HER LIKING ME IS EVERY THING YOU SHAN'T TALK ME OUT OF MY SATISFACTION
I HAVE SEEN HIM FOR EVER IN TOWN
YOUR CASE IS A VERY UNFORTUNATE ONE YOU SEEM TO ME TO BE SURROUNDED WITH DIFFICULTIES AND YOU WILL HAVE NEED OF ALL YOUR MUTUAL AFFECTION TO SUPPORT YOU UNDER THEM MISTER FERRARS I BELIEVE IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON HIS MOTHER
AND NEVER LOOKED AT ME IN A PLEASANT WAY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF I HAD BEEN TREATED IN THAT FORBIDDING SORT OF WAY
BUT EVEN THIS ENCOURAGEMENT FAILED FOR HE WOULD GO AND LUCY WHO WOULD HAVE OUTSTAID HIM HAD HIS VISIT LASTED TWO HOURS SOON AFTERWARDS WENT AWAY WHAT CAN BRING HER HERE SO OFTEN SAID MARIANNE ON HER LEAVING THEM
YOU AND I SIR JOHN SAID MISSUS JENNINGS SHOULD NOT STAND UPON SUCH CEREMONY THEN YOU WOULD BE VERY ILL BRED CRIED MISTER PALMER
WHILE HER EYES BRIGHTENED AT THE INFORMATION IT WOULD HAVE GAVE ME SUCH PLEASURE TO MEET YOU THERE BUT I DARE SAY YOU WILL GO FOR ALL THAT TO BE SURE YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER WILL ASK YOU TO COME TO THEM
HE SEEMS AN EXCELLENT MAN AND I THINK HIM UNCOMMONLY PLEASING
HERSELF THE WIDOW OF ONLY A KNIGHT SHE GAVE THE DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE AND SIR WALTER INDEPENDENT OF HIS CLAIMS AS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AN ATTENTIVE NEIGHBOUR
FOR HIS HEART HAD NOT THE INDIFFERENCE OF LUCY'S NOR COULD HIS CONSCIENCE HAVE QUITE THE EASE OF ELINOR'S LUCY WITH A DEMURE AND SETTLED AIR SEEMED DETERMINED TO MAKE NO CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMFORT OF THE OTHERS
SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PRESENCE OF LUCY NOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME INJUSTICE TOWARDS HERSELF TO DETER HER FROM SAYING THAT SHE WAS HAPPY TO SEE HIM
NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM MY INTENTION THAN TO GIVE YOU SUCH AN IDEA COULD YOU HAVE A MOTIVE FOR THE TRUST THAT WAS NOT HONOURABLE AND FLATTERING TO ME AND YET I DO ASSURE YOU REPLIED LUCY
SHE DISLIKED BATH AND DID NOT THINK IT AGREED WITH HER AND BATH WAS TO BE HER HOME SIR WALTER HAD AT FIRST THOUGHT MORE OF LONDON
I AM SO GLAD WE ARE GOT ACQUAINTED AT LAST CONTINUED CHARLOTTE AND NOW I HOPE WE SHALL ALWAYS BE GREAT FRIENDS YOU CAN'T THINK HOW MUCH I LONGED TO SEE YOU IT IS SO DELIGHTFUL THAT YOU SHOULD LIVE AT THE COTTAGE NOTHING CAN BE LIKE IT TO BE SURE
HE IS THE MOST FEARFUL OF GIVING PAIN OF WOUNDING EXPECTATION AND THE MOST INCAPABLE OF BEING SELFISH OF ANY BODY I EVER SAW EDWARD IT IS SO AND I WILL SAY IT
EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUSTICE AND EQUITY
ELINOR HARDLY KNEW WHETHER TO SMILE OR SIGH AT THIS ASSERTION LUCY WENT ON
AND UNDER MANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT NATURALLY WOULD DURING A FOUR YEARS ENGAGEMENT
NOW MY PLAN IS THAT HE SHOULD TAKE ORDERS AS SOON AS HE CAN AND THEN THROUGH YOUR INTEREST WHICH I AM SURE YOU WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO USE OUT OF FRIENDSHIP FOR HIM AND I HOPE OUT OF SOME REGARD TO ME
SHE WAS OF STRICT INTEGRITY HERSELF WITH A DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR BUT SHE WAS AS DESIROUS OF SAVING SIR WALTER'S FEELINGS AS SOLICITOUS FOR THE CREDIT OF THE FAMILY AS ARISTOCRATIC IN HER IDEAS OF WHAT WAS DUE TO THEM AS ANYBODY OF SENSE AND HONESTY COULD WELL BE
UPON MY WORD REPLIED ELINOR YOU KNOW MUCH MORE OF THE MATTER THAN I DO IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO EXPECT SUCH A MATCH
FOR SHE LOITERED AWAY SEVERAL MINUTES ON THE LANDING PLACE WITH THE MOST HIGH MINDED FORTITUDE BEFORE SHE WENT TO HER SISTER WHEN THAT WAS ONCE DONE HOWEVER IT WAS TIME FOR THE RAPTURES OF EDWARD TO CEASE FOR MARIANNE'S JOY HURRIED HER INTO THE DRAWING ROOM IMMEDIATELY
AND IT WAS ONLY ON THE SUPPOSITION OF HIS BEING SPONTANEOUSLY SOLICITED BY SOME MOST UNEXCEPTIONABLE APPLICANT ON HIS OWN TERMS AND AS A GREAT FAVOUR THAT HE WOULD LET IT AT ALL HOW QUICK COME THE REASONS FOR APPROVING WHAT WE LIKE
THE VISIT OF THE MISS STEELES AT BARTON PARK WAS LENGTHENED FAR BEYOND WHAT THE FIRST INVITATION IMPLIED THEIR FAVOUR INCREASED THEY COULD NOT BE SPARED SIR JOHN WOULD NOT HEAR OF THEIR GOING AND IN SPITE OF THEIR NUMEROUS AND LONG ARRANGED ENGAGEMENTS IN EXETER
THAT DID NOT ADMIT OF A DOUBT BUT SHE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT DONE WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE PAIN TO HIM AND ELIZABETH SHE DREW UP PLANS OF ECONOMY SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING SHE CONSULTED ANNE
THE UNDESIRABLENESS OF ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR SIR WALTER WAS CERTAINLY MUCH STRENGTHENED BY ONE PART AND A VERY MATERIAL PART OF THE SCHEME WHICH HAD BEEN HAPPILY ENGRAFTED ON THE BEGINNING HE WAS NOT ONLY TO QUIT HIS HOME
AND LUCY WAS STILL THE FIRST TO END IT SHALL YOU BE IN TOWN THIS WINTER MISS DASHWOOD SAID SHE WITH ALL HER ACCUSTOMARY COMPLACENCY CERTAINLY NOT I AM SORRY FOR THAT RETURNED THE OTHER
TO DO IT WELL THAT SHE FORCED HERSELF AFTER A MOMENT'S RECOLLECTION TO WELCOME HIM WITH A LOOK AND MANNER THAT WERE ALMOST EASY AND ALMOST OPEN AND ANOTHER STRUGGLE ANOTHER EFFORT STILL IMPROVED THEM
TO BE MORE THOROUGHLY GOOD NATURED OR MORE DETERMINED TO BE HAPPY THAN MISSUS PALMER THE STUDIED INDIFFERENCE INSOLENCE AND DISCONTENT OF HER HUSBAND GAVE HER NO PAIN AND WHEN HE SCOLDED OR ABUSED HER SHE WAS HIGHLY DIVERTED
INDEED I AM BOUND TO LET YOU INTO THE SECRET FOR YOU ARE A PARTY CONCERNED
ELINOR WAS VERY ANGRY BUT MARIANNE SEEMED ENTIRELY INSENSIBLE OF THE STING FOR SHE CALMLY REPLIED NOT SO INDEED FOR SERIOUSLY SPEAKING I AM VERY SURE THAT CONSCIENCE ONLY KEPT EDWARD FROM HARLEY STREET
AND COULD STRUGGLE WITH ANY POVERTY FOR HIM BUT I LOVE HIM TOO WELL TO BE THE SELFISH MEANS OF ROBBING HIM PERHAPS OF ALL THAT HIS MOTHER MIGHT GIVE HIM IF HE MARRIED TO PLEASE HER WE MUST WAIT IT MAY BE FOR MANY YEARS
HOW FEW PEOPLE KNOW WHAT COMFORT IS SIR JOHN IS AS STUPID AS THE WEATHER THE REST OF THE COMPANY SOON DROPT IN I AM AFRAID MISS MARIANNE SAID SIR JOHN
IN SPITE OF ALL THAT LADY RUSSELL WHO THOUGHT IT A FRIENDSHIP QUITE OUT OF PLACE COULD HINT OF CAUTION AND RESERVE LADY RUSSELL INDEED HAD SCARCELY ANY INFLUENCE WITH ELIZABETH AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER
FOR THOSE WHO WILL ACCEPT OF MY LOVE AND ESTEEM MUST SUBMIT TO MY OPEN COMMENDATION THE NATURE OF HER COMMENDATION IN THE PRESENT CASE HOWEVER HAPPENED TO BE PARTICULARLY ILL SUITED TO THE FEELINGS OF TWO THIRDS OF HER AUDITORS AND WAS SO VERY UNEXHILARATING TO EDWARD
HER LOVE MADE NO ANSWER AND AFTER SLIGHTLY BOWING TO THE LADIES BEGAN COMPLAINING OF THE WEATHER HOW HORRID ALL THIS IS SAID HE SUCH WEATHER MAKES EVERY THING AND EVERY BODY DISGUSTING
AND OF HER BEING PARTICULARLY DISGUSTED WITH HIS MOTHER TILL THEY WERE MORE IN PRIVATE BUT WHY WERE YOU NOT THERE EDWARD WHY DID YOU NOT COME I WAS ENGAGED ELSEWHERE
PERHAPS BE A LITTLE SOURED BY FINDING LIKE MANY OTHERS OF HIS SEX THAT THROUGH SOME UNACCOUNTABLE BIAS IN FAVOUR OF BEAUTY HE WAS THE HUSBAND OF A VERY SILLY WOMAN BUT SHE KNEW THAT THIS KIND OF BLUNDER WAS TOO COMMON FOR ANY SENSIBLE MAN TO BE LASTINGLY HURT BY IT
FORTY THREE HE CALLED SHARPLY I WANT YOU DOWN HERE JOHN TOOK HIS PAINT POT AND BRUSH AND WENT CLATTERING DOWN THE UNCARPETED STAIRS WHERE'S THE OTHER MAN ASKED THE WARDER IN A LOW VOICE
BRYCE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION POINTED OUT BEHIND THE PERGOLA OF RAMBLER ROSES THE FIGURES OF MEN WERE COMING TOWARDS THE OLD WELL HOUSE LED BY ONE OF FOLLIOT'S GARDENERS SUDDENLY THEY EMERGED INTO FULL VIEW
HOW ASKED JOHN IN SURPRISE THE MAN JERKED HIS HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISON LARRY GREEN HE SAID BRIEFLY HE'S COMING OUT NEXT MONTH TOO AND WE ARE ALL FIXED UP PROPER WE ARE GOING TO GET THE PILE
WITH A GLANCE OF SIGNIFICANT INTEREST DEEPEST WELL IN ALL WRYCHESTER UNDER THAT HE REMARKED YOU'D NEVER THINK IT IT'S A HUNDRED FEET DEEP AND MORE DRY NOW
AND CLOSE BEHIND HIM THE DETECTIVE
BEYOND THE VILLAGE OF PRINCETOWN AND ON THE TAVISTOCK ROAD
IF BRYCE HAD BUT KNOWN IT WHILE HE REMAINED SILENT HE WATCHED BRYCE NARROWLY AND WHEN HE SPOKE HIS VOICE WAS CALM AS EVER
FOLLIOT NODDED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF EXPRESSION AYE DOCTOR HE SAID AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT GLASSDALE NOW BRYCE WHO WOULD HAVE CHEERFULLY HOBNOBBED WITH A MAN
BUT AS WHO HE REALLY WAS JOHN BRAKE THAT WAS AT A PLACE CALLED BRADEN MEDWORTH NEAR BARTHORPE IN LEICESTERSHIRE HE PAUSED THERE WATCHING FOLLIOT BUT FOLLIOT SHOWED NO MORE THAN CLOSE ATTENTION AND BRYCE WENT ON
AND ABOUT WHO KILLED HIM AND WHY THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OF DOING ALL THAT SORT OF THING YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK A LONG WAY BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNINGS I WENT BACK TO THE TIME WHEN BRADEN WAS MARRIED NOT AS BRADEN OF COURSE
HIS ENVY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO GENUINE GOING OUT THE DRIVE IN THE BRAKE TO THE STATION THE RIDE TO LONDON IN CREASED BUT COMFORTABLE CLOTHING FREE AS THE AIR AT LIBERTY TO GO TO BED AND RISE WHEN HE LIKED
AND NOW POLISHED TO MARBLE LIKE SMOOTHNESS IN ITS MIDST SET FLUSH WITH THE FLOOR WAS WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY A TRAP DOOR FURNISHED WITH A HEAVY IRON RING TO THIS FOLLIOT POINTED
WHICH TOLD JOHN AS CLEARLY AS THOUGH THE MAN HAD CONFESSED AS MUCH THAT HE HAD NEVER OCCUPIED ANY SOCIAL POSITION IN LIFE THE WARDER'S STEP ON THE STONES OUTSIDE REDUCED THEM TO SILENCE SUDDENLY HIS VOICE CAME UP THE STAIRS
IN THAT PART OF FOLLIOT'S BIG GARDEN I WANT A BIT OF TALK WITH YOU SAID BRYCE AS FOLLIOT CLOSED THE DOOR AND TURNED DOWN A SIDE PATH TO A STILL MORE RETIRED REGION PRIVATE TALK LET'S GO WHERE IT'S QUIET
NOT MINE MY LAD ANSWERED FOLLIOT CONFIDENTLY THAT'S A FACT BRYCE HESITATED GIVING FOLLIOT A SEARCHING LOOK AND FOLLIOT NODDED SOLEMNLY I TELL YOU NOT MINE HE REPEATED I'D NAUGHT TO DO WITH IT
I WAS PUT AWAY BY A WOMAN AFTER THREE OF US HAD GOT CLEAR WITH TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS DAMN ROUGH LUCK WASN'T IT JOHN NODDED IT WAS CURIOUS HE THOUGHT HOW SYMPATHETIC ONE GROWS WITH THESE EXPONENTS OF CRIMES
WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY SAID THE OTHER I HAVE NO REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU AS YET KARA BREATHED LEXMAN A WORD FROM YOU COULD HAVE SAVED ME I COULD NOT LIE MY DEAR LEXMAN
LEAVING THE OTHER IN CHARGE OF BOTH MEN FOR AN HOUR THEY WORKED IN SILENCE UNDER THE EYES OF THE GUARD PRESENTLY THE WARDER WENT OUTSIDE AND JOHN LEXMAN HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING HIS FELLOW SUFFERER
BRAKE HAD EVIDENTLY A BELIEF IN THESE MEN AND HE TRUSTED THEM UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIMSELF HE SOMETIMES TRUSTED THE BANK'S MONEY TO THEM I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HE USED TO LET THEM HAVE MONEY FOR SHORT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TO BE REFUNDED
AND ONCE HE HEARD A HOLLOW RUMBLE AS IT CROSSED A WOODEN BRIDGE HE COULD NOT DETECT FROM HIS HIDING PLACE IN WHAT DIRECTION THEY WERE GOING BUT HE GATHERED THEY HAD SWITCHED OFF TO THE LEFT
HE WAS A MAN OF TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE LITHE AND ALERT BY NO MEANS BAD LOOKING
AT THE SIDE OF THE SEAT HE PASSED IT BACK JOHN LEXMAN READ IF YOU CANNOT SWIM THERE IS A LIFE BELT UNDER YOUR SEAT JOHN NODDED KARA WAS SEARCHING THE SEA FOR SOMETHING AND PRESENTLY HE FOUND IT
WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY TAKEN BY THE PRISON STAFF AND IT WAS TO THE DECORATION OF ONE OF THESE THAT A O FORTY THREE HAD BEEN SENT THE HOUSE WAS AS YET WITHOUT A TENANT A PAPER HANGER UNDER THE CHARGE OF ANOTHER WARDER
WHICH SHOWED THAT HE KNEW HE HAD THE WHIP HAND SHALL I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT FALKINER WRAYE HE ASKED I WILL IT'S DEEPLY INTERESTING MISTER FALKINER WRAYE AFTER CHEATING AND DECEIVING BRAKE
WHEN THAT CAR COMES ABREAST OF THE GATE ASK NO QUESTIONS AND JUMP INTO IT GET DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM AND PULL A SACK OVER YOU AND DO NOT GET UP UNTIL THE CAR STOPS THE BLOOD RUSHED TO JOHN LEXMAN'S HEAD AND HE STAGGERED
ONE NATURALLY ADOPTS THEIR POINT OF VIEW AND SEES LIFE THROUGH THEIR DISTORTED VISION I BET I'M NOT GIVEN AWAY WITH THE NEXT LOT THE PRISONER WENT ON I'VE GOT ONE OF THE BIGGEST IDEAS I'VE EVER HAD AND I'VE GOT A REAL GOOD MAN TO HELP ME
BEFORE TESTING THE LIFE OF A CONVICT ESTABLISHMENT HE BELIEVED THERE WAS SOME TALK OF SENDING HIM TO PARKHURST AND HERE HE TRACED THE INFLUENCE WHICH T X WOULD EXERCISE FOR PARKHURST WAS A PRISONER'S PARADISE
WHICH DISTINGUISHED THE MAJORITY OF THE INHABITANTS AT DARTMOOR THEY WAITED UNTIL THEY HEARD THE WARDER'S STEP CLEAR THE PASSAGE AND UNTIL HIS IRON SHOD BOOTS WERE TRAMPING OVER THE COBBLED PATH WHICH LED FROM THE DOOR THROUGH THE TINY GARDEN TO THE ROAD
HAD THAT PUT IN HE CONTINUED AND TURNED THE TOP OF THE BUILDING INTO A LITTLE SNUGGERY COME UP HE LED THE WAY TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS IN ONE CORNER OF THE LOWER ROOM PUSHED OPEN A DOOR AT THEIR HEAD
FOR A MOMENT HE THOUGHT HE WAS ALONE AND LOOKED AROUND
YOU'RE NO DOUBT AS YOU SAY A GOOD HAND AT FINDING THINGS OUT AND YOU'VE DOUBTLESS DONE A GOOD BIT OF FERRETING AND DONE IT WELL ENOUGH IN YOUR OWN OPINION BUT THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN'T FIND OUT AND THE POLICE CAN'T FIND OUT EITHER
NOW THEN WHO IS HE FOLLIOT REPLIED WITH A SHREWD GLANCE A MAN WHO BY GIVING AWAY ANOTHER MAN GAVE HIMSELF AWAY WOULD BE A DAMNED FOOL HE ANSWERED IF THERE IS ANOTHER MAN AS IF THERE MUST BE INTERRUPTED BRYCE
FROM TIME TO TIME HE CONSULTED THE COMPASS ON THE BOARD BEFORE HIM AND CHANGED HIS COURSE EVER SO SLIGHTLY PRESENTLY HE RELEASED ONE HAND FROM THE DRIVING WHEEL AND SCRIBBLING ON A LITTLE BLOCK OF PAPER WHICH WAS INSERTED IN A POCKET
FOR THE DAY HE WAS TO PAINT SOME DOORS AND WINDOWS OF AN OUTLYING COTTAGE A COTTAGE OCCUPIED BY A WARDER WHO FOR SOME REASON ON THE DAY PREVIOUS HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
AND EVENTUALLY HE CAME BACK AND MARRIED A RICH WIDOW AND SETTLED HIMSELF DOWN IN AN OUT OF THE WORLD ENGLISH TOWN TO GROW ROSES YOU'RE FALKINER WRAYE YOU KNOW MISTER FOLLIOT BRYCE LAUGHED AS HE MADE THIS DIRECT ACCUSATION
MY WIFE SHE IS WAITING FOR YOU SAID THE OTHER HE TURNED HIS HEAD LISTENING
BUT IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALL SIGNS OF THE LAND WERE BLOTTED OUT TALKING WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE ROAR OF THE ENGINES DEFIED PENETRATION KARA WAS EVIDENTLY A SKILFUL PILOT
WITH A CERTAIN KINDNESS AND A CERTAIN RESPECT WHICH WAS UNUSUAL FACE THE WALL GROWLED A VOICE AND MECHANICALLY HE TURNED HIS HANDS STILL BEHIND HIM AND STOOD STARING AT THE GREY WALL OF THE PRISON STOREHOUSE
NEVER ONCE DID HE FEEL THE CAR SLACKEN ITS PACE UNTIL WITH A GRIND OF BRAKES IT STOPPED SUDDENLY GET OUT SAID A VOICE JOHN LEXMAN THREW OFF THE COVER AND LEAPT OUT AND AS HE DID SO
WATER GAVE OUT SOME YEARS AGO SOME PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PULLED THIS OLD WELL HOUSE DOWN BUT NOT ME I DID BETTER I TURNED IT TO GOOD ACCOUNT HE RAISED A HAND AND POINTED UPWARD TO AN OBVIOUSLY MODERN CEILING OF STRONG OAK TIMBERS
AND HAD CARRIED HIS OWN GLASS TO ANOTHER EASY CHAIR DID FOLLIOT REFER TO ANY REASON FOR BRYCE'S VISIT BUT ONCE SETTLED DOWN HE LOOKED AT HIM SPECULATIVELY WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME ABOUT HE ASKED
I MEAN ABOUT RECENT MATTERS REPLIED BRYCE I'VE INTERESTED MYSELF IN THEM FOR REASONS OF MY OWN EVER SINCE BRADEN WAS FOUND AT THE FOOT OF THOSE STAIRS IN PARADISE AND I WAS FETCHED TO HIM I'VE INTERESTED MYSELF AND
A SHARP EXCLAMATION FROM HIM TOOK BRYCE TO HIS SIDE FOLLIOT LIFTED A SHAKING HAND AND POINTED INTO THE GARDEN THERE HE WHISPERED HELL AND WHAT'S THIS MEAN
NOW HE SAW THE POINT FOR WHICH KARA WAS MAKING A WHITE STEAM YACHT LONG AND NARROW OF BEAM WAS STEAMING SLOWLY WESTWARD HE COULD SEE THE FEATHERY WAKE IN HER REAR
WITHOUT REPLYING IN WORDS TO THIS SUGGESTION FOLLIOT LED THE WAY THROUGH HIS ROSE TREES TO A FAR CORNER OF HIS GROUNDS WHERE AN OLD BUILDING OF GREY STONE COVERED WITH IVY STOOD AMONGST HIGH TREES
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HORSES BUT ONLY A GREAT BAT LIKE MACHINE WITH OUT STRETCHED PINIONS OF TAUT WHITE CANVAS AND BY THAT MACHINE
THAT COLLISHAW'S DEAD NOR IF ONE HAD HIS NECK BROKEN AND THE OTHER WAS POISONED BUT WHOSE HAND WAS THAT WHICH THE MASON VARNER SAW THAT MORNING WHEN BRAKE WAS FLUNG OUT OF THAT DOORWAY COME NOW WHOSE
WHICH MARKS THE CONVICT HIS HEAD WAS CLIPPED SHORT
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN HIS FAMILY AFFAIRS SAID BRYCE WHAT BECAME OF BRAKE'S WIFE AND CHILDREN WHEN HE WENT TO PRISON FOLLIOT SHOOK HIS HEAD
IF I HAVE MY PRICE IT'S NOT IN THE SAME COMMODITY THAT GLASSDALE WOULD WANT BUT BEFORE WE DO ANY TALKING ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING I WANT TO ADD TO MY STOCK OF KNOWLEDGE LOOK HERE WE'LL BE CANDID I DON'T CARE A SNAP OF MY FINGERS THAT BRAKE
HE NODDED AT A BOX OF CIGARS WHICH LAY OPEN ON A TABLE AT BRYCE'S ELBOW AS HE BEGAN TO MIX A COUPLE OF DRINKS HELP YOURSELF HE SAID GOOD STUFF THOSE NOT UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN BRYCE A DRINK
NEW INTERESTS MADE UP HIS EXISTENCE THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD WAS ONE THE CHARACTER OF THE BOOK HE WOULD RECEIVE FROM THE PRISON LIBRARY ANOTHER THE FUTURE MEANT SUNDAY CHAPEL THE PRESENT WHATEVER TASK THEY FOUND HIM
BUT BRYCE SAW THAT HIS COOL ALMOST INDIFFERENT MANNER WAS CHANGING HE WAS BEGINNING UNDER THE SURFACE TO GET ANXIOUS WHEN I LEFT GLASSDALE AT NOON CONTINUED BRYCE I'D NO IDEA AND I DON'T THINK HE HAD
YOU'D HAVE A JOB TO GET IT RETORTED FOLLIOT SUPPOSING THAT ALL YOU SAY IS TRUE ABOUT ABOUT PAST MATTERS NOTHING CAN PROVE NOTHING
ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN PROVE EASILY THAT I NEVER DID MEET HIM I CAN ACCOUNT FOR EVERY MINUTE OF MY TIME THAT DAY AS TO THE OTHER AFFAIR NOT AN OUNCE OF DIRECT EVIDENCE THEN IT WAS THE OTHER MAN EXCLAIMED BRYCE
PASSING THROUGH DRIFTING CLOUDS
AS LEXMAN GATHERED FROM A GLIMPSE OF THE CREW BY GREEKS HE SCRAMBLED ABOARD AND FIVE MINUTES LATER HE WAS STANDING ON THE WHITE DECK OF THE YACHT WATCHING THE DISAPPEARING TAIL OF THE MONOPLANE KARA WAS BY HIS SIDE
WITHIN A VERY BRIEF SPACE BUT HE WENT TO THE FIRE TOO OFTEN AND GOT HIS FINGERS BURNED IN THE END THE TWO MEN DID HIM ONE OF THEM IN PARTICULAR AND CLEARED OUT HE HAD TO STAND THE RACKET
AND THE FACE OF THE DRIVER WAS HALF ENVELOPED IN A BIG RUBBER MASK THROUGH THE TWO GREAT GOGGLES JOHN COULD SEE LITTLE TO HELP HIM IDENTIFY THE MAN AS THE MACHINE CAME UP TO THE GATE HE LEAPT INTO THE TONNEAU AND SANK INSTANTLY TO THE BOTTOM
MY GOD HE WHISPERED DO AS I TELL YOU HISSED THE WARDER LIKE AN AUTOMATON JOHN PUT DOWN HIS BRUSHES AND WALKED SLOWLY TO THE GATE THE GREY CAR WAS CRAWLING UP THE HILL
NOT MUCH IN THAT FOR THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY HE CONTINUED BUT BRAKE HAD OTHER ASSOCIATIONS WITH BARTHORPE A BIT LATER HE GOT TO KNOW GOT INTO CLOSE TOUCH WITH A BARTHORPE MAN WHO ABOUT THE TIME OF BRAKE'S MARRIAGE
HE DARE NOT LET HIS MIND DWELL UPON THE LONG ACHING YEARS AHEAD HE DARE NOT THINK OF THE WOMAN HE LEFT OR LET HIS MIND DWELL UPON THE AGONY WHICH SHE WAS ENDURING HE HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE WORLD
I SHOULDN'T WONDER REMARKED BRYCE REFLECTIVELY AND ALMOST AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF I SHOULDN'T AT ALL WONDER IF GLASSDALE'S THE SORT OF MAN WHO CAN BE BOUGHT HE NO DOUBT HAS HIS PRICE BUT ALL THAT GLASSDALE KNOWS IS NOTHING
IT WAS A SQUARE BUILDING OF OLD STONE ITS WALLS UNLINED UNPLASTERED ITS FLOOR PAVED WITH MUCH WORN FLAGS OF LIMESTONE EVIDENTLY SET DOWN IN A LONG DEAD AGE
TO THE DANGEROUS SEAT BEHIND HE WAS DEADLY COLD
WHICH CAME INTO THE EYES OF THE QUESTIONER WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FIFTEEN YEARS SAID THE OTHER THAT MEANS ELEVEN YEARS AND NINE MONTHS SAID THE FIRST MAN YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE I SUPPOSE HARDLY SAID LEXMAN DRILY
WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ASKED FOLLIOT
AND WHO'S RANSFORD THEN I NEVER HEARD BRAKE SPEAK OF ANY RANSFORD WHAT GAME IS ALL THIS WHAT BEFORE BRYCE COULD REPLY FOLLIOT SUDDENLY STARTED THRUST HIS COMPANION ASIDE AND WENT TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS
JOHN STUMBLED DOWN THE SLOPE AS HE NEARED THE MACHINE HE STOPPED AND GASPED KARA HE SAID AND THE BROWN MAN SMILED BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
HE STOOD IT TO THE TUNE OF TEN YEARS PENAL SERVITUDE
HE TURNED AT THE SOUND OF A VOICE HE WAS STANDING ON THE SLOPE OF A SMALL TOR AT THE FOOT THERE WAS A SMOOTH STRETCH OF GREEN SWARD IT WAS ON THIS STRETCH THAT THE PEOPLE OF DARTMOOR HELD THEIR PONY RACES IN THE SUMMER MONTHS
HE WANTED TO FIND THOSE TWO MEN AND BEGAN A LONG SEARCH FOR THEM LIKE TO KNOW THE NAMES OF THE MEN MISTER FOLLIOT YOU MIGHT MENTION EM IF YOU KNOW EM ANSWERED FOLLIOT THE NAME OF THE PARTICULAR ONE WAS WRAYE FALKINER WRAYE
I'VE DISCOVERED A GREAT DEAL MORE MUCH MORE THAN'S KNOWN TO ANYBODY FOLLIOT THREW ONE LEG OVER THE OTHER AND BEGAN TO JOG HIS FOOT OH HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE DEAR ME AND WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW DOCTOR AUGHT YOU CAN TELL ME EH
THAT HE WAS COMING TO SEE YOU BUT I KNOW WHAT PUT THE NOTION INTO HIS HEAD I GAVE HIM COPIES OF THOSE TWO REWARD BILLS HE NO DOUBT THOUGHT HE MIGHT MAKE A BIT AND SO HE CAME IN TO TOWN AND TO YOU WELL ASKED FOLLIOT
VIEWED FROM THE HEIGHT AT WHICH THEY FLEW IT LOOKED NO MORE THAN A WHITE SPECK IN A GREAT BLUE SAUCER BUT PRESENTLY THE MACHINE BEGAN TO DIP FALLING AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED WHICH TOOK AWAY THE BREATH OF THE MAN WHO WAS HANGING ON WITH BOTH HANDS
AND THEN SUDDENLY THE JERKY PROGRESS CEASED THE MACHINE SWAYED GENTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND LOOKING OVER THE PASSENGER SAW THE GROUND RECEDE BENEATH HIM UP UP THEY CLIMBED IN ONE LONG SWEEPING ASCENT
THE TWO OR THREE CHAIRS WERE DEEP AND BIG ENOUGH TO LIE DOWN IN THE TWO WINDOWS COMMANDED PLEASANT VIEWS OF THE CATHEDRAL TOWERS ON ONE SIDE AND OF THE CLOSE ON THE OTHER NICE LITTLE PLACE TO BE ALONE IN D'YE SEE SAID FOLLIOT
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO
AND LEAVING HIM TO PAY THE PENALTY OF HIS OVER TRUSTFULNESS CLEARED OUT OF ENGLAND AND CARRIED HIS MONEY MAKING TALENTS TO FOREIGN PARTS HE SUCCEEDED IN DOING WELL
HE CLICKED OVER A LEVER AND WITH A ROAR THE BIG THREE BLADED TRACTOR SCREW SPUN THE AEROPLANE MOVED FORWARD WITH A JERK
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE OLD WELL HOUSE WHEN BRYCE CAME HURRYING UP TO HIM FOLLIOT WAS STANDING AT HIS GARDEN DOOR WITH HIS HANDS THRUST UNDER HIS COAT TAILS THE VERY PICTURE OF A BENEVOLENT LEISURED GENTLEMAN
GOOD PLACE FOR THAT CERTAINLY AGREED BRYCE FOLLIOT POINTED HIS VISITOR TO ONE OF THE BIG CHAIRS AND TURNING TO A CABINET BROUGHT OUT SOME GLASSES A SYPHON OF SODA WATER AND A HEAVY CUT GLASS DECANTER
TO WHAT I KNOW FOLLIOT HAD ALLOWED HIS CIGAR TO GO OUT HE THREW IT AWAY TOOK A FRESH ONE FROM THE BOX AND SLOWLY STRUCK A MATCH AND LIGHTED IT WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW HE ASKED AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE
YOU SAID JUST NOW THAT YOU'D NO DOUBT THAT MAN GLASSDALE COULD BE BOUGHT AND I'M INCLINING TO THINK THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE MEN THAT HAVE THEIR PRICE WHAT IS IT WE'VE NOT COME TO THAT RETORTED BRYCE YOU'RE A BIT MISTAKEN
FORTUNATE FOR YOU MISTER FOLLIOT THAT THE POLICE DON'T KNOW ALL THAT I KNOW FOR IF THEY DID THOSE MARKS WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU DAYS AGO FOR A MINUTE OR TWO FOLLIOT SAT JOGGLING HIS LEG A BAD SIGN IN HIM OF RISING TEMPER
WAS WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE PAINTER THE TWO WARDERS EXCHANGED GREETINGS
IT WAS ALL SO INCREDIBLE SO IMPOSSIBLE HE EXPECTED TO WAKE UP
THEN WHO HAD DEMANDED BRYCE WAS IT THE OTHER MAN FLOOD AND IF SO WHO IS FLOOD FOLLIOT GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND CIGAR BETWEEN HIS LIPS AND HANDS UNDER THE TAILS OF HIS OLD COAT
AND BY THAT TIME THEY WILL PICK US UP HIS VOICE WAS HIGH AND HARSH IN THE ALMOST PAINFUL SILENCE WHICH FOLLOWED THE STOPPAGE OF THE ENGINES IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE BOAT HAD COME ALONGSIDE MANNED
THE WORLD HE LOVED AND THE WORLD THAT KNEW HIM AND ALL THAT THERE WAS IN LIFE ALL THAT WAS WORTH WHILE HAD BEEN CRUSHED AND OBLITERATED INTO THE GRANITE OF THE PRINCETOWN QUARRIES
UPON HIS HAGGARD FACE STANDING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM HE WAITED FOR THE MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD BE ORDERED TO HIS WORK JOHN LEXMAN A O FORTY THREE
A WIDE TERM REMARKED FOLLIOT
WHOM HE WAS ABOUT TO CONDUCT TO THE SCAFFOLD LIFTED HIS GLASS AND DRANK A GOOD DEAL HE ANSWERED
A PRETTY COIL HE SAID WITH A SNEER HERE YOU TALKED ABOUT MY PRICE I'M QUITE CONTENT TO HOLD MY TONGUE IF YOU'D TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO WHAT ASKED FOLLIOT YOU KNEW BRAKE
HE'S UPSTAIRS IN THE BACK ROOM THE WARDER STEPPED OUT OF THE DOOR AND LOOKED LEFT AND RIGHT COMING UP FROM PRINCETOWN WAS A BIG GREY CAR PUT DOWN YOUR PAINT POT HE SAID HIS VOICE WAS SHAKING WITH EXCITEMENT I AM GOING UPSTAIRS
HE HEARD HIS WARDER'S VOICE BEHIND HIM RIGHT TURN FORTY THREE QUICK MARCH HE WALKED AHEAD OF THE ARMED GUARD THROUGH THE GREAT AND GLOOMY GATES OF THE PRISON TURNED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT AND WALKED UP THE VILLAGE STREET
JOHN LEXMAN LOOKED DOWN HE SAW THE INDENTATIONS OF THE COAST
BEFORE THE SECOND MAN SPOKE WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR HE ASKED IN A LOW VOICE MURDER SAID JOHN LEXMAN LACONICALLY HE HAD ANSWERED THE QUESTION BEFORE
HE WAS EVIDENTLY THINKING DEEPLY AND BRYCE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DISTURB HIM SOME MINUTES WENT BY BEFORE FOLLIOT TOOK THE CIGAR FROM HIS LIPS AND LEANING AGAINST THE CHIMNEYPIECE LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIS VISITOR LOOK HERE MY LAD HE SAID EARNESTLY
HE HEARD THE SHUFFLING FEET OF THE QUARRY GANG HIS EARS CAUGHT THE CLINK OF THE CHAINS WHICH BOUND THEM TOGETHER THEY WERE DESPERATE MEN PECULIARLY INTERESTING TO HIM AND HE HAD WATCHED THEIR FACES FURTIVELY IN THE EARLY PERIOD
BUT NEITHER YOU NOR THE POLICE NOR ANYBODY COULD FASTEN ME TO EITHER MATTER GRANTING ALL YOU SAY TO BE TRUE WHERE'S THE POSITIVE TRUTH WHAT ABOUT CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ASKED BRYCE
I WAS HERE WHEN I WAS A KID CONFESSED THE PAPER HANGER I AM GOING OUT NEXT WEEK JOHN LEXMAN LOOKED AT HIM ENVIOUSLY HAD THE MAN TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD INHERITED A GREAT FORTUNE AND A GREATER TITLE
THE FACT IS I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU SO
YOU HAVEN'T TIME FOR ARGUMENT THEY DISCOVERED YOUR ESCAPE HE SAID GET IN JOHN CLAMBERED UP INTO THE FRAIL BODY OF THE MACHINE AND KARA FOLLOWED THIS IS A SELF STARTER HE SAID ONE OF THE NEWEST MODELS OF MONOPLANES
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SEE IT
BRYCE WHO HAD LIGHTED A CIGAR LOOKED ACROSS ITS SMOKE AT THE IMPERTURBABLE FACE OPPOSITE YOU'VE JUST HAD GLASSDALE HERE HE OBSERVED QUIETLY I SAW HIM LEAVE YOU
THERE GOES FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS SAID THE GREEK WITH A SMILE
AND THEN TO HIS LEFT HAND FALKINER WRAYE HE SAID HAD AN UNFORTUNATE GUN ACCIDENT IN HIS YOUTH WHICH MARKED HIM FOR LIFE HE LOST THE MIDDLE FINGER OF HIS LEFT HAND AND HE GOT A BAD SCAR ON HIS LEFT JAW THERE THEY ARE THOSE MARKS
AS HE DID SO HE FELT THE CAR LEAP FORWARD UNDERNEATH HIM NOW IT WAS GOING FAST NOW FASTER NOW IT ROCKED AND SWAYED AS IT GATHERED SPEED HE FELT IT SWEEPING DOWN HILL AND UP HILL
THEN HE'S SAFE CONCLUDED FOLLIOT YOU'LL GET NOTHING FROM ME ABOUT HIM AND NOBODY CAN GET AT YOU EXCEPT THROUGH HIM ASKED BRYCE THAT'S ABOUT IT ASSENTED FOLLIOT LACONICALLY BRYCE LAUGHED CYNICALLY
LEFT BARTHORPE END SETTLED IN LONDON BRAKE AND THIS MAN BEGAN TO HAVE SOME SECRET DEALINGS TOGETHER THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN IN WITH THEM TOO
TO CHOOSE HIS OWN DINNER TO ANSWER NO CALL SAVE THE CALL OF HIS CONSCIENCE TO SEE HE CHECKED HIMSELF WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR HE ASKED IN SELF DEFENCE CONSPIRACY AND FRAUD SAID THE OTHER CHEERFULLY
AND AS THE AEROPLANE FELL HE HAD TIME TO OBSERVE THAT A BOAT HAD BEEN PUT OFF THEN WITH A JERK THE MONOPLANE FLATTENED OUT AND CAME LIKE A SKIMMING BIRD TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER HER ENGINES STOPPED
LOTS ANSWERED BRYCE I CAME TO TELL YOU ON SEEING THAT GLASSDALE HAD BEEN WITH YOU BECAUSE I WAS WITH GLASSDALE THIS MORNING FOLLIOT MADE NO ANSWER
OF HIS IMPRISONMENT HE HAD BEEN SENT TO DARTMOOR AFTER SPENDING THREE MONTHS IN WORMWOOD SCRUBBS OLD HANDS HAD TOLD HIM VARIOUSLY THAT HE WAS FORTUNATE OR UNLUCKY IT WAS USUAL TO HAVE TWELVE MONTHS AT THE SCRUBBS
REPLIED BRYCE PROMPTLY OF THE OTHER THE MAN OF LESSER IMPORTANCE FLOOD
YOU'RE WRONG HE ANSWERED I NEVER AT ANY TIME KNEW ANYTHING OF BRAKE'S FAMILY AFFAIRS SO LITTLE INDEED THAT I NEVER EVEN KNEW HE WAS MARRIED BRYCE ROSE TO HIS FEET AND STOOD STARING WHAT HE EXCLAIMED
BRYCE IN HIS EAGERNESS AND SURPRISE GRASPED FOLLIOT'S ARM AND SHOOK IT GOOD HEAVENS MAN HE SAID THOSE TWO WARDS OF RANSFORD'S ARE BRAKE'S GIRL AND BOY DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT DIDN'T YOU NEVER ANSWERED FOLLIOT NEVER
COOL IN SUMMER WARM IN WINTER MODERN FIRE GRATE YOU NOTICE
AND MOTIONED BRYCE TO ENTER QUIET ENOUGH IN HERE DOCTOR HE OBSERVED YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS PLACE BIT OF A FANCY OF MINE BRYCE ABSORBED AS HE WAS IN THE THOUGHTS OF THE MOMENT
WAS ALREADY MORE THAN SHE WAS MEANT TO CARRY ADD TO THAT THE POWDER PORK AND BREAD BAGS THE GUNWALE WAS LIPPING ASTERN
BUT IT WAS PLAIN THAT THEY MEANT NOTHING SHOULD DELAY THEIR SHOT THEY HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS LOOKED AT THEIR FALLEN COMRADE THOUGH HE WAS NOT DEAD
AND WELCOMED HER HOME ON HER MARRIAGE JOY WAS IN EVERY FACE AND EVERY HEART THE FEAST WAS GRAND THEY DANCED AND SANG ALL WERE MERRY
HAVE A CLEAN SKILLET WITH A PINT OF BOILING WATER IN IT STIR IT IN AND WHEN DONE SEASON IT WITH SALT TO YOUR TASTE
WHAT A PALTRY PLACE SAID SHE TO WHOM DOES THAT LITTLE DIRTY HOLE BELONG THEN THE FIDDLER SAID THAT IS YOUR AND MY HOUSE WHERE WE ARE TO LIVE
AND CONVEYS NUTRIMENT IN A FORM THAT WILL HARDLY DISAGREE WITH THE MOST DELICATE STOMACH AND HAS BEEN TAKEN WHEN NEARLY ALL OTHER FOOD WAS REJECTED A FEW DROPS OF VINEGAR AND A LITTLE SALT RENDERS IT MORE PALATABLE
HUNTER WAS STEADY THAT WE KNEW JOYCE WAS A DOUBTFUL CASE A PLEASANT POLITE MAN FOR A VALET
OR JUST ABOUT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE WAY WE OUGHT TO GO WE'LL NEVER GET ASHORE AT THIS RATE SAID I IF IT'S THE ONLY COURSE THAT WE CAN LIE SIR WE MUST EVEN LIE IT
AH UNLUCKY WRETCH THAT I AM SIGHED SHE WOULD THAT I HAD MARRIED KING GRISLY BEARD NEXT THEY CAME TO SOME FINE MEADOWS WHOSE ARE THESE BEAUTIFUL GREEN MEADOWS SAID SHE
THEY BELONG TO KING GRISLY BEARD
SO WORDS AND TEARS WERE OF NO AVAIL THE PARSON WAS SENT FOR AND SHE WAS MARRIED TO THE FIDDLER WHEN THIS WAS OVER THE KING SAID NOW GET READY TO GO YOU MUST NOT STAY HERE
WHEN IT HAS BOILED DOWN TO A PINT TAKE IT UP AND PUT IN A LITTLE SALT AND SLICE OF TOASTED BREAD THIS IS VALUABLE IN CASES OF DYSENTERY AND CHOLERA MORBUS PARTICULARLY WHEN MADE OF OLD FOWLS
SAID SHE THE NEXT WAS TOO TALL WHAT A MAYPOLE SAID SHE THE NEXT WAS TOO SHORT WHAT A DUMPLING SAID SHE THE FOURTH WAS TOO PALE
NOT HAVING REACHED HIM WHERE THE BALL PASSED NOT ONE OF US PRECISELY KNEW BUT I FANCY IT MUST HAVE BEEN OVER OUR HEADS AND THAT THE WIND OF IT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR DISASTER
AND WE GOT HER TO LIE A LITTLE MORE EVENLY ALL THE SAME WE WERE AFRAID TO BREATHE IN THE SECOND PLACE THE EBB WAS NOW MAKING A STRONG RIPPLING CURRENT
WHERE ARE YOUR SERVANTS CRIED SHE
SO THAT THE MEATS IN IT FELL ABOUT THEN EVERYBODY LAUGHED AND JEERED AT HER AND SHE WAS SO ABASHED THAT SHE WISHED HERSELF A THOUSAND FEET DEEP IN THE EARTH SHE SPRANG TO THE DOOR TO RUN AWAY
KING GRISLY BEARD A GREAT KING OF A LAND FAR AWAY IN THE EAST HAD A DAUGHTER WHO WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT SO PROUD AND HAUGHTY AND CONCEITED
BACKED WITH A GREAT HEAVE THAT SENT HER STERN BODILY UNDER WATER THE REPORT FELL IN AT THE SAME INSTANT OF TIME THIS WAS THE FIRST THAT JIM HEARD THE SOUND OF THE SQUIRE'S SHOT
BELOW THE CLUSTERING TREES THE GIG WAS NO LONGER TO BE FEARED THE LITTLE POINT HAD ALREADY CONCEALED IT FROM OUR EYES THE EBB TIDE WHICH HAD SO CRUELLY DELAYED US
AND STEW IT IN A SKILLET WITH A LITTLE CREAM AND BUTTER IF IT IS PREFERRED DRY IT MAY BE FRIED IN BUTTER ALONE
AND ASKED THITHER ALL HER SUITORS AND THEY ALL SAT IN A ROW RANGED ACCORDING TO THEIR RANK KINGS AND PRINCES AND DUKES AND EARLS AND COUNTS AND BARONS AND KNIGHTS
OR WHETHER THEY WERE LAZY AND WOULD NOT I DO NOT KNOW HOWEVER THEY TOOK IT INTO THEIR HEADS THAT IT DID NOT BECOME THEM TO GO HOME ON FOOT SO CHANTICLEER BEGAN TO BUILD A LITTLE CARRIAGE OF NUTSHELLS AND WHEN IT WAS FINISHED
AND SIX MICE BUILT A LITTLE HEARSE TO CARRY HER TO HER GRAVE AND WHEN IT WAS READY THEY HARNESSED THEMSELVES BEFORE IT AND CHANTICLEER DROVE THEM ON THE WAY THEY MET THE FOX
THAT HAD BEEN LAID TO DRY OVER A BAKER'S OVEN AND THUS SHE HAD SOME JOKE TO CRACK UPON EVERY ONE BUT SHE LAUGHED MORE THAN ALL AT A GOOD KING WHO WAS THERE LOOK AT HIM SAID SHE
AND CHANTICLEER REPLIED ALL ON OUR WAY A VISIT TO PAY TO MISTER KORBES THE FOX TODAY THEN THE CAT SAID TAKE ME WITH YOU CHANTICLEER SAID
AND LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION I SAW THE OTHER PIRATES TROOPING OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES AND TUMBLING INTO THEIR PLACES IN THE BOATS
LET HIM COME IN SO THEY BROUGHT IN A DIRTY LOOKING FELLOW AND WHEN HE HAD SUNG BEFORE THE KING AND THE PRINCESS HE BEGGED A BOON THEN THE KING SAID
AS FOR THE CAPTAIN HE HAD CARRIED HIS OVER HIS SHOULDER BY A BANDOLEER AND LIKE A WISE MAN LOCK UPPERMOST THE OTHER THREE HAD GONE DOWN WITH THE BOAT
YOU HAVE SUNG SO WELL THAT I WILL GIVE YOU MY DAUGHTER FOR YOUR WIFE
AND STIR IN WHEN IT BOILS KEEP STIRRING IT FIVE MINUTES WHEN POUR IT IN A BOWL AND SEASON WITH SALT BARLEY WATER
TWO FRESH MEN WERE AT THE OARS THE TIDE KEEPS WASHING HER DOWN COULD YOU PULL A LITTLE STRONGER NOT WITHOUT SWAMPING THE BOAT SAID HE YOU MUST BEAR UP SIR
IF YOU HAVE RENNET IN A BOTTLE OF WINE TWO TEA SPOONSFUL OF IT WILL MAKE A QUART OF WHEY
BUT DO NOT LET IT BURN PUT IT IN A PITCHER AND POUR BOILING WATER ON IT TOAST WATER WILL ALLAY THIRST BETTER THAN ALMOST ANY THING ELSE IF IT IS WANTED TO DRINK THROUGH THE NIGHT IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE MADE EARLY IN THE EVENING
HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS THE NUTS ARE QUITE RIPE NOW SAID CHANTICLEER TO HIS WIFE PARTLET SUPPOSE WE GO TOGETHER TO THE MOUNTAINS AND EAT AS MANY AS WE CAN
AND POUR IT OUT ON A SLICE OF BREAD TOASTED AND CUT UP OR SOME DRIED RUSK IF THE PATIENT SHOULD LIKE THEM YOU CAN PUT IN A FEW RAISINS STONED AND CUT UP
WINE WHEY
PUT IT IN A SAUCE PAN WITH A QUART OF NEW MILK
PARTLET AND HAVING DUG A GRAVE FOR HER HE LAID HER IN IT AND MADE A LITTLE HILLOCK OVER HER THEN HE SAT DOWN BY THE GRAVE AND WEPT AND MOURNED TILL AT LAST HE DIED TOO
ALAS SIGHED SHE
FOR WE HAD ALL QUIETLY MADE UP OUR MINDS TO TREAT HIM LIKE ONE OF OURSELVES SUDDENLY THE CAPTAIN SPOKE UP AGAIN AND I THOUGHT HIS VOICE WAS A LITTLE CHANGED
MISTER TRELAWNEY WILL YOU PLEASE PICK ME OFF ONE OF THESE MEN SIR HANDS IF POSSIBLE SAID THE CAPTAIN
ANOTHER DAY
I'LL TRY AND SET UP A TRADE IN POTS AND PANS
NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR THE JOLLY BOAT'S LAST TRIP THIS FIFTH TRIP WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE OTHERS IN THE FIRST PLACE
ALL ON A SUDDEN AS SHE WAS GOING OUT IN CAME THE KING'S SON IN GOLDEN CLOTHES
IF THE ROOM IS KEPT PERFECTLY STILL BOILED CUSTARD BEAT AN EGG WITH A HEAPED TEA SPOONFUL OF SUGAR STIR IT INTO A TEA CUPFUL OF BOILING MILK AND STIR TILL IT IS THICK
ON OUR FEET THE OTHER THREE TOOK COMPLETE HEADERS AND CAME UP AGAIN DRENCHED AND BUBBLING SO FAR THERE WAS NO GREAT HARM NO LIVES WERE LOST
HOWEVER HE KEPT FAST HOLD AND LED HER IN
RUNNING WESTWARD THROUGH THE BASIN AND THEN SOUTH'ARD AND SEAWARD DOWN THE STRAITS BY WHICH WE HAD ENTERED IN THE MORNING EVEN THE RIPPLES WERE A DANGER TO OUR OVERLOADED CRAFT
EVERY THING SHOULD BE PERFECTLY CLEAN AND NICE
AND DELAYING OUR ASSAILANTS THE ONE SOURCE OF DANGER WAS THE GUN IF I DURST SAID THE CAPTAIN I'D STOP AND PICK OFF ANOTHER MAN
BUT THE BRIDE SAID RUN FIRST AND BRING ME MY GARLAND THAT IS HANGING ON A WILLOW IN THE GARDEN
CRYING NOW DUCK GET ON AS FAST AS YOU CAN AND AWAY THEY WENT AT A PRETTY GOOD PACE AFTER THEY HAD TRAVELLED ALONG A LITTLE WAY
THAT THE LOG OF WOOD FELL IN AND WAS CARRIED AWAY BY THE STREAM THEN A STONE WHO SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED CAME UP AND KINDLY OFFERED TO HELP POOR CHANTICLEER BY LAYING HIMSELF ACROSS THE STREAM
AND IF NICELY WARMED OVER IS AS GOOD AS WHEN FRESH CORN GRUEL
THE PIN STUCK HIMSELF INTO THE BED PILLOW THE MILLSTONE LAID HIMSELF OVER THE HOUSE DOOR AND THE EGG ROLLED HIMSELF UP IN THE TOWEL WHEN MISTER KORBES CAME HOME HE WENT TO THE FIREPLACE TO MAKE A FIRE
ALL HANDS STAND BY TO TRIM HER WHEN HE AIMS THE SQUIRE RAISED HIS GUN THE ROWING CEASED
TRELAWNEY WAS AS COOL AS STEEL HE LOOKED TO THE PRIMING OF HIS GUN NOW CRIED THE CAPTAIN EASY WITH THAT GUN SIR OR YOU'LL SWAMP THE BOAT
TOASTED AND BUTTERED THIS IS A VERY DELICATE WAY OF COOKING EGGS BARLEY PANADA BOIL A SMALL TEA CUP OF BARLEY IN WATER TILL IT IS SOFT WITH A TEA CUP OF RAISINS
AND HAVING DONE THIS THEY CREPT AWAY AS SOFTLY AS POSSIBLE HOWEVER THE DUCK WHO SLEPT IN THE OPEN AIR IN THE YARD HEARD THEM COMING AND JUMPING INTO THE BROOK WHICH RAN CLOSE BY THE INN SOON SWAM OUT OF THEIR REACH
AND WE COULD WADE ASHORE IN SAFETY BUT THERE WERE ALL OUR STORES AT THE BOTTOM AND TO MAKE THINGS WORSE
HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF
WE PUT THE BOAT'S HEAD DIRECT FOR THE LANDING PLACE BY THIS TIME WE HAD GOT SO FAR OUT OF THE RUN OF THE CURRENT THAT WE KEPT STEERAGE WAY EVEN AT OUR NECESSARILY GENTLE RATE OF ROWING
CREAM TOAST CUT A SLICE OF STALE BREAD AND WET IT WITH CREAM TOAST IT SLOWLY AND BUTTER IT THIS IS VERY NICE FOR AN INVALID AND AN AGREEABLE CHANGE
LET IT BOIL TEN MINUTES AND STRAIN IT
THE BEAR THE GOAT AND ALL THE BEASTS OF THE WOOD CAME AND CLIMBED UPON THE HEARSE SO ON THEY WENT TILL THEY CAME TO A RAPID STREAM HOW SHALL WE GET OVER SAID CHANTICLEER
THEN SAID A STRAW I WILL LAY MYSELF ACROSS
THEY HAD ALL BEEN THINE AH UNLUCKY WRETCH THAT I AM SAID SHE WOULD THAT I HAD MARRIED KING GRISLY BEARD THEN THEY CAME TO A GREAT CITY
IS VERY USEFUL TO STRAIN LEMONADE PANADA OR HERB TEA IF YOU WANT ANY THING TO USE THROUGH THE NIGHT YOU SHOULD PREPARE IT IF POSSIBLE BEFOREHAND AS A PERSON THAT IS SICK CAN SOMETIMES FALL ASLEEP WITHOUT KNOWING IT
YOU MUST TRAVEL ON WITH YOUR HUSBAND
PUT A PINT OF WATER IN A CLEAN SKILLET WITH A LITTLE BUTTER AND SALT WHEN IT BOILS BREAK TWO EGGS IN A PLATE AND PUT THEM IN
BUT IT MADE HER FINGERS VERY SORE I SEE THIS WORK WON'T DO SAID HE TRY AND SPIN PERHAPS YOU WILL DO THAT BETTER SO SHE SAT DOWN AND TRIED TO SPIN
AND THE DUCK SEEMED MUCH TIRED AND WADDLED ABOUT A GOOD DEAL FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
NOW PARTLET FOUND A VERY LARGE NUT BUT SHE SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT TO CHANTICLEER AND KEPT IT ALL TO HERSELF
CUT IT IN SMALL PIECES BRUISE IT TILL TENDER PUT IT IN A WIDE MOUTHED BOTTLE AND CORK IT TIGHT
LET IT SOAK A FEW MINUTES TO EXTRACT THE SALT AND STEW IT IN A LITTLE WATER JUST BEFORE IT IS DONE PUT IN SOME CREAM AND PARSLEY IF YOU BROIL HAM THAT IS UNCOOKED IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE SOAKED IN WATER A FEW MINUTES
IT IS A COOLING DRINK IN FEVERS IF THE WEATHER IS COLD YOU CAN MAKE A LARGER QUANTITY SOME BOIL WHOLE RAISINS WITH BARLEY TAKE IT WITH OR WITHOUT SEASONING TO POACH EGGS
FOOD FOR THE SICK REMARKS ON PREPARING FOOD FOR THE SICK FEW YOUNG PERSONS UNDERSTAND COOKING FOR THE SICK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW TO PREPARE THEIR FOOD IN AN INVITING MANNER
THE LITTLE GALLIPOT OF A BOAT THAT WE WERE IN WAS GRAVELY OVERLOADED FIVE GROWN MEN AND THREE OF THEM TRELAWNEY REDRUTH AND THE CAPTAIN OVER SIX FEET HIGH
MOISTEN TWO TEA SPOONSFUL OF POWDERED ARROW ROOT WITH WATER AND RUB IT SMOOTH WITH A SPOON THEN POUR ON HALF A PINT OF BOILING WATER SEASON IT WITH LEMON JUICE OR WINE AND NUTMEG IN COOKING ARROW ROOT FOR CHILDREN
AND OFFERED A TARGET LIKE A BARN DOOR I COULD HEAR AS WELL AS SEE THAT BRANDY FACED RASCAL ISRAEL
WHEN YOU SEE THE MATCH AND WE'LL HOLD WATER IN THE MEANWHILE WE HAD BEEN MAKING HEADWAY AT A GOOD PACE FOR A BOAT SO OVERLOADED AND WE HAD SHIPPED
TO MISTER KORBES THE FOX TODAY SOON AFTER CAME UP A MILLSTONE AN EGG A DUCK AND A PIN AND CHANTICLEER GAVE THEM ALL LEAVE TO GET INTO THE CARRIAGE AND GO WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT MISTER KORBES'S HOUSE
CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN THAT THERE ARE NO BURNT GRAINS CHOCOLATE TO MAKE A CUP OF CHOCOLATE GRATE A LARGE TEA SPOONFUL IN A MUG
IT IS A VERY GOOD WAY TO MAKE IT VERY THICK AND THIN IT AFTERWARDS WITH MILK SAGO WASH THE SAGO ALLOWING TWO TABLE SPOONSFUL TO A QUART OF WATER AND SOAK IT AN HOUR
POUR IT IN A BOWL ON A SLICE OF TOAST CUT UP AND GRATE A LITTLE NUTMEG OVER PANADA PUT SOME CRACKERS CRUSTS OF DRY BREAD OR DRIED RUSK IN A SAUCE PAN WITH COLD WATER AND A FEW RAISINS
SEVERAL TIMES WE SHIPPED A LITTLE WATER AND MY BREECHES AND THE TAILS OF MY COAT WERE ALL SOAKING WET BEFORE WE HAD GONE A HUNDRED YARDS THE CAPTAIN MADE US TRIM THE BOAT
AND PUT IN A SPOONFUL OF BUTTER TOAST A SLICE OF BREAD AND MOISTEN IT WITH WATER THEN POUR ON THE BOILING MILK THIS IS VERY GOOD FOR SICK PERSONS AND CAN BE EATEN WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION
I WILL LAY MYSELF ACROSS THE STREAM AND YOU SHALL PASS OVER UPON ME
BUT WHEN HE STIRRED IT UP THE EGGSHELLS FLEW INTO HIS EYES AND ALMOST BLINDED HIM BLESS ME SAID HE ALL THE WORLD SEEMS TO HAVE A DESIGN AGAINST MY HEAD THIS MORNING
TO ADD TO OUR CONCERN
CALF'S FOOT BLANCMANGE PUT A SET OF NICELY CLEANED FEET IN FOUR QUARTS OF WATER AND LET IT BOIL MORE THAN HALF AWAY STRAIN THROUGH A COLANDER AND WHEN IT IS COLD SCRAPE OFF ALL THE FAT
AND BROKE ALL HER GOODS INTO A THOUSAND PIECES THEN SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO AH WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME SAID SHE WHAT WILL MY HUSBAND SAY
BUT ON THE STEPS KING GRISLY BEARD OVERTOOK HER AND BROUGHT HER BACK AND SAID
AND THE NEEDLE CRIED OUT STOP STOP
PAT A TEA SPOONFUL IN A POT THAT WILL HOLD ABOUT TWO CUPS AND POUR BOILING WATER ON IT LET IT SET BY THE FIRE TO DRAW FIVE OR TEN MINUTES RYE MUSH THIS IS A NOURISHING AND LIGHT DIET FOR THE SICK
AND SEASON IT WITH WINE OR LEMON JUICE TAPIOCA JELLY WASH THE TAPIOCA WELL AND LET IT SOAK FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN COLD WATER PUT IT IN A SAUCE PAN WITH THE SAME WATER AND LET IT BOIL SLOWLY TILL IT IS CLEAR AND THICK
THEN WARM IT AND PUT IN A LITTLE SALT
AND WHEN NOBODY WAS STIRRING IN THE INN CHANTICLEER AWAKENED HIS WIFE AND FETCHING THE EGG THEY PECKED A HOLE IN IT ATE IT UP AND THREW THE SHELLS INTO THE FIREPLACE
HAD BEEN AT A PUBLIC HOUSE A FEW MILES OFF AND HAD SAT DRINKING TILL THEY HAD FORGOTTEN HOW LATE IT WAS HE BEGGED THEREFORE THAT THE TRAVELLERS WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO GIVE THEM A LIFT IN THEIR CARRIAGE
GIVE WAY THEN CRIED THE CAPTAIN WE MUSTN'T MIND IF WE SWAMP HER NOW IF WE CAN'T GET ASHORE ALL'S UP ONLY ONE OF THE GIGS IS BEING MANNED SIR
THEN HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND WENT WITHOUT HIS SUPPER TO BED BUT WHEN HE LAID HIS HEAD ON THE PILLOW THE PIN RAN INTO HIS CHEEK AT THIS HE BECAME QUITE FURIOUS AND JUMPING UP WOULD HAVE RUN OUT OF THE HOUSE
WHILE THIS WAS PASSING A DUCK CAME QUACKING UP AND CRIED OUT YOU THIEVING VAGABONDS WHAT BUSINESS HAVE YOU IN MY GROUNDS I'LL GIVE IT YOU WELL FOR YOUR INSOLENCE
LET IT STAND COVERED BY THE FIRE A FEW MINUTES WHEN YOU CAN PUT IN SUGAR AND CREAM BLACK TEA BLACK TEA IS MUCH MORE SUITABLE THAN GREEN FOR SICK PERSONS AS IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE NERVES
AND TO BRUSH ONE'S CLOTHES BUT NOT ENTIRELY FITTED FOR A MAN OF WAR WITH ALL THIS IN OUR MINDS WE WADED ASHORE AS FAST AS WE COULD LEAVING BEHIND US
IF YOU PLEASE BEAR UP UNTIL YOU SEE YOU'RE GAINING I TRIED AND FOUND BY EXPERIMENT THAT THE TIDE KEPT SWEEPING US WESTWARD UNTIL I HAD LAID HER HEAD DUE EAST
YOU MUST DO FOR YOURSELF WHATEVER IS TO BE DONE NOW
WHEN IT TURNS TAKE OUT THE RENNET
THE GUN SAID HE I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID I FOR I MADE SURE HE WAS THINKING OF A BOMBARDMENT OF THE FORT THEY COULD NEVER GET THE GUN ASHORE
AND THIS TIME HE GOT SAFELY TO THE OTHER SIDE WITH THE HEARSE
SET IT OVER THE FIRE TILL IT JUST BOILS AGAIN THEN SET IT OFF TILL THE CURD HAS SETTLED
AS STANDING IN THE TIN POT SPOILS THE FLAVOR PUT TWO TEA SPOONSFUL OF GROUND COFFEE IN A SMALL MUG AND POUR BOILING WATER ON IT LET IT SET BY THE FIRE TO SETTLE AND POUR IT OFF IN A CUP WITH SUGAR AND CREAM
SEASON TO YOUR TASTE WITH WINE NUTMEG AND BUTTER OAT MEAL GRUEL
YOU HAVE LEARNT WISDOM AND IT IS TIME TO HOLD OUR MARRIAGE FEAST THEN THE CHAMBERLAINS CAME AND BROUGHT HER THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ROBES AND HER FATHER AND HIS WHOLE COURT WERE THERE ALREADY
RETURNED THE CAPTAIN WE MUST KEEP UPSTREAM YOU SEE SIR HE WENT ON IF ONCE WE DROPPED TO LEEWARD OF THE LANDING PLACE IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE WE SHOULD GET ASHORE
MIXED SMOOTH IN A LITTLE WATER AND STIRRED IN A PINT OF BOILING WATER LET IT BOIL TWENTY MINUTES STIRRING FREQUENTLY
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE OTHER FOUR WHO FELL THE CRY HE GAVE WAS ECHOED NOT ONLY BY HIS COMPANIONS ON BOARD BUT BY A GREAT NUMBER OF VOICES FROM THE SHORE
MUTTON MAY BE DONE IN THE SAME WAY MUTTON AND VEAL BROTH BOIL A PIECE OF MUTTON TILL IT COMES TO PIECES THEN STRAIN THE BROTH AND LET IT GET COLD
CHANTICLEER RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD TO THE RIVER AND SAID RIVER GIVE ME SOME WATER FOR PARTLET LIES IN THE MOUNTAIN
SO SHE RAN HOME AND TOLD HIM ALL
WITH ALL MY HEART GET UP BEHIND AND BE SURE YOU DO NOT FALL OFF TAKE CARE OF THIS HANDSOME COACH OF MINE NOR DIRTY MY PRETTY RED WHEELS SO FINE NOW MICE BE READY AND WHEELS RUN STEADY FOR WE ARE GOING A VISIT TO PAY
I AM THE FIDDLER WHO HAS LIVED WITH YOU IN THE HUT I BROUGHT YOU THERE BECAUSE I REALLY LOVED YOU I AM ALSO THE SOLDIER THAT OVERSET YOUR STALL
THEN SHE WAS IN A GREAT FRIGHT AND CRIED OUT TO CHANTICLEER
SO CHANTICLEER BUILT A HANDSOME CARRIAGE WITH FOUR RED WHEELS AND HARNESSED SIX MICE TO IT AND THEN HE AND PARTLET GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE AND AWAY THEY DROVE SOON AFTERWARDS A CAT MET THEM AND SAID WHERE ARE YOU GOING
I ADDED THE CREW OF THE OTHER MOST LIKELY GOING ROUND BY SHORE TO CUT US OFF THEY'LL HAVE A HOT RUN SIR RETURNED THE CAPTAIN
WAS IN CONSEQUENCE THE MOST EXPOSED HOWEVER WE HAD NO LUCK FOR JUST AS TRELAWNEY FIRED DOWN HE STOOPED THE BALL WHISTLED OVER HIM
TAMARINDS CURRANT OR GRAPE JELLY CRANBERRIES OR DRIED FRUIT OF ANY KIND MAKE A GOOD DRINK COFFEE SICK PERSONS SHOULD HAVE THEIR COFFEE MADE SEPARATE FROM THE FAMILY
JACK ASHORE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THEM I MIND IT'S THE ROUND SHOT CARPET BOWLS MY LADY'S MAID COULDN'T MISS TELL US SQUIRE
IF YOU HAVE A SMALL CHICKEN IT WILL TAKE HALF OF IT TO MAKE A PINT OF CHICKEN WATER
BEEF FEET SOAK THE FEET AND HAVE THEM NICELY CLEANED BOIL THEM SLOWLY AND TAKE OFF THE SCUM AS IT RISES WHEN THEY ARE SOFT AND TENDER TAKE THEM UP AND SEPARATE THE BONES FROM THE GLUTINOUS PART
BESIDES THE CHANCE OF BEING BOARDED BY THE GIGS WHEREAS THE WAY WE GO THE CURRENT MUST SLACKEN AND THEN WE CAN DODGE BACK ALONG THE SHORE
LIGHTWOOD HINTED WELL YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR IT WAS A QUESTION OF MAKING A MOVE IT'S OF NO USE MOVING IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR MOVE IS YOU HAD BETTER BY FAR KEEP STILL
TWO OR THREE OLD SCULLS AND OARS STOOD AGAINST THE WALL AND AGAINST ANOTHER PART OF THE WALL WAS A SMALL DRESSER MAKING A SPARE SHOW OF THE COMMONEST ARTICLES OF CROCKERY AND COOKING VESSELS THE ROOF OF THE ROOM WAS NOT PLASTERED BUT WAS FORMED OF THE FLOORING OF THE ROOM ABOVE
WHETHER IN THAT SHABBY ROOK'S NEST HE IS ALWAYS PLOTTING WISDOM OR PLOTTING MURDER WHETHER HE WILL GROW UP AFTER SO MUCH SOLITARY BROODING TO ENLIGHTEN HIS FELLOW CREATURES OR TO POISON THEM IS THE ONLY SPECK OF INTEREST THAT PRESENTS ITSELF TO MY PROFESSIONAL VIEW
HERE THE GIRL AROSE WITH HER WORK IN HER HAND AND WENT OUT AT THE DOOR NO MONEY PURSUED MORTIMER BUT THREEPENCE IN ONE OF THE SKIRT POCKETS THREE PENNY PIECES SAID GAFFER HEXAM IN AS MANY SENTENCES
HAS FOR SOME TIME PAST GIVEN THE OTHER MAN A BAD NAME ARISING OUT OF YOUR LIME BARGES AND THAT THE OTHER MAN HAS BEEN AVOIDED IN CONSEQUENCE I DON'T SAY WHAT IT MEANS OR PROVES BUT IT'S A CERTAIN FACT
THEN SAID FOLDING A PLAIT IN THE RIGHT LEG OF HIS TROUSERS HE GETS HIS LIVING ALONG SHORE IS IT FAR
IT WON'T DO MORTIMER WE MUST GET INTO THE AIR WE MUST JOIN OUR DEAR FRIEND AND BROTHER RIDERHOOD
THIS BEING VERY OLD KNOTTED SEAMED AND BEAMED GAVE A LOWERING ASPECT TO THE CHAMBER AND ROOF AND WALLS AND FLOOR ALIKE ABOUNDING IN OLD SMEARS OF FLOUR RED LEAD OR SOME SUCH STAIN WHICH IT HAD PROBABLY ACQUIRED IN WAREHOUSING AND DAMP ALIKE HAD A LOOK OF DECOMPOSITION
AND EACH OF US HAS THE FOURTH OF A CLERK CASSIM BABA IN THE ROBBER'S CAVE AND CASSIM IS THE ONLY RESPECTABLE MEMBER OF THE PARTY I AM ONE BY MYSELF ONE SAID MORTIMER
THE TWO FRIENDS READ THE HANDBILL AS IT STUCK AGAINST THE WALL AND GAFFER READ THEM AS HE HELD THE LIGHT ONLY PAPERS ON THE UNFORTUNATE MAN I SEE SAID LIGHTWOOD GLANCING FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WAS FOUND TO THE FINDER ONLY PAPERS
HIGH UP AN AWFUL STAIRCASE COMMANDING A BURIAL GROUND AND I HAVE A WHOLE CLERK TO MYSELF AND HE HAS NOTHING TO DO BUT LOOK AT THE BURIAL GROUND AND WHAT HE WILL TURN OUT WHEN ARRIVED AT MATURITY I CANNOT CONCEIVE
MAY BE ENDOWED WITH PHILANTHROPY ENOUGH TO TURN BOTTOM UPWARD AND EXTINGUISH HIM MORTIMER MY HONOURABLE FRIEND THREE BURGLARIES TWO FORGERIES AND A MIDNIGHT ASSASSINATION
NO RESPONSE AS SHE RE ENTERED AT THE DOOR HE DROPPED OVER THE BANK AND MADE HIS WAY BACK AMONG THE OOZE AND NEAR THE HIDING PLACE TO MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD TO WHOM HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN OF THE GIRL AND HOW THIS WAS BECOMING VERY GRIM INDEED
HE COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE SHINING THROUGH THE WINDOW PERHAPS IT DREW HIM ON TO LOOK IN PERHAPS HE HAD COME OUT WITH THE EXPRESS INTENTION
SHE HAD NO OTHER LIGHT THAN THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE THE UNKINDLED LAMP STOOD ON THE TABLE SHE SAT ON THE GROUND LOOKING AT THE BRAZIER WITH HER FACE LEANING ON HER HAND
THEIR RETREAT WAS SO CHOSEN THAT WHILE THEY COULD WATCH THE RIVER THEY COULD WATCH THE HOUSE NO ONE HAD PASSED IN OR OUT SINCE THE DAUGHTER THOUGHT SHE HEARD THE FATHER CALLING NO ONE COULD PASS IN OR OUT WITHOUT BEING SEEN BUT IT WILL BE LIGHT AT FIVE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
HE HAD THE SPECIAL PECULIARITY OF SOME BIRDS OF PREY THAT WHEN HE KNITTED HIS BROW HIS RUFFLED CREST STOOD HIGHEST YOU DID NOT FIND ALL THESE YOURSELF DID YOU ASKED EUGENE TO WHICH THE BIRD OF PREY SLOWLY REJOINED AND WHAT MIGHT YOUR NAME BE NOW
MORTIMER RANG THE BELL TO PAY THE SCORE AND BOB APPEARED TO TRANSACT THAT BUSINESS WITH HIM WHOM EUGENE IN HIS CARELESS EXTRAVAGANCE ASKED IF HE WOULD LIKE A SITUATION IN THE LIME TRADE THANKEE SIR NO SIR SAID BOB I'VE A GOOD SITIWATION HERE SIR
THIS IS MY FRIEND MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD INTERPOSED MISTER EUGENE WRAYBURN MISTER EUGENE WRAYBURN IS IT AND WHAT MIGHT MISTER EUGENE WRAYBURN HAVE ASKED OF ME I ASKED YOU SIMPLY IF YOU FOUND ALL THESE YOURSELF
MISTER INSPECTOR HAVING PROPOSED AS AN APPROPRIATE SENTIMENT THE LIME TRADE AND BOB WITHDREW TO REPORT THE COMMENDATIONS OF THE GUESTS TO MISS ABBEY IN THE BAR
TASTES LIKE THE WASH OF THE RIVER ARE YOU SO FAMILIAR WITH THE FLAVOUR OF THE WASH OF THE RIVER I SEEM TO BE TO NIGHT I FEEL AS IF I HAD BEEN HALF DROWNED AND SWALLOWING A GALLON OF IT INFLUENCE OF LOCALITY SUGGESTED LIGHTWOOD
ALWAYS WELL DISPOSED TO ASSIST THE CONSTITUTED AUTHORITIES MISS ABBEY BADE BOB GLIDDERY ATTEND THE GENTLEMEN TO THAT RETREAT AND PROMPTLY ENLIVEN IT WITH FIRE AND GASLIGHT
THERE MAY TURN OUT TO BE SOMETHING CONSIDERABLE FOR HIM THAT COMES IN SECOND AND I DON'T MENTION WHO MAY OR WHO MAY NOT TRY FOR THAT PLACE
THERE WAS A CURIOUS MIXTURE IN THE BOY OF UNCOMPLETED SAVAGERY AND UNCOMPLETED CIVILIZATION HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE AND COARSE AND HIS FACE WAS COARSE AND HIS STUNTED FIGURE WAS COARSE BUT HE WAS CLEANER THAN OTHER BOYS OF HIS TYPE AND HIS WRITING THOUGH LARGE AND ROUND WAS GOOD
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN RULE BRITANNIA MUTTERED EUGENE BUT IT WASN'T MORTIMER HERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MISTER INSPECTOR TWO BURGLARIES NOW AND A FORGERY
MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND WILL I TRUST EXCUSE ME AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER FOR THROWING OUT A REMARK WHICH I FEEL TO BE DUE TO THIS HOUSE AND THE COUNTRY WAS THAT THE T'OTHER GOVERNOR OR LAWYER LIGHTWOOD ASKED RIDERHOOD
THERE WAS A KIND OF FILM OR FLICKER ON HER FACE WHICH AT FIRST HE TOOK TO BE THE FITFUL FIRELIGHT BUT ON A SECOND LOOK HE SAW THAT SHE WAS WEEPING A SAD AND SOLITARY SPECTACLE AS SHOWN HIM BY THE RISING AND THE FALLING OF THE FIRE
THE GENTLEMAN FATHER THE FIGURE AT THE RED FIRE TURNED RAISED ITS RUFFLED HEAD AND LOOKED LIKE A BIRD OF PREY YOU'RE MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD ESQUIRE ARE YOU SIR MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD IS MY NAME WHAT YOU FOUND
AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF YOUR BOAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR WHAT IF I PUT OFF IN HER AND TAKE A LOOK ROUND
AND LAZARUS YES AND HIM TOO BUT DON'T YOU TELL MY FATHER WE SHOULD HAVE NO PEACE IN OUR PLACE IF THAT GOT TOUCHED UPON IT'S MY SISTER'S CONTRIVING
THE TROUSERS POCKETS EMPTY AND TURNED INSIDE OUT GAFFER HEXAM NODDED BUT THAT'S COMMON
SAID THE BOY BUT IF SHE KNOWS HER LETTERS IT'S THE MOST SHE DOES AND THEM I LEARNED HER
COME TO OUR HONEST FRIEND HE LED HIM TO THE POST OF WATCH AND THEY BOTH DROPPED DOWN AND CREPT UNDER THE LEE OF THE BOAT
AND FORASMUCH AS CROUCHING UNDER THE LEE OF A HAULED UP BOAT ON A NIGHT WHEN IT BLEW COLD AND STRONG AND WHEN THE WEATHER WAS VARIED WITH BLASTS OF HAIL AT TIMES
BUT THE WHOLE WAS VERY INDISTINCTLY SEEN IN THE OBSCURITY OF THE NIGHT THE BOY LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE DOOR AND THEY PASSED AT ONCE INTO A LOW CIRCULAR ROOM WHERE A MAN STOOD BEFORE A RED FIRE LOOKING DOWN INTO IT AND A GIRL SAT ENGAGED IN NEEDLEWORK
THE LOW BUILDING HAD THE LOOK OF HAVING ONCE BEEN A MILL
AND HE GLANCED AT THE BACKS OF THE BOOKS WITH AN AWAKENED CURIOSITY THAT WENT BELOW THE BINDING NO ONE WHO CAN READ EVER LOOKS AT A BOOK EVEN UNOPENED ON A SHELF LIKE ONE WHO CANNOT WERE ANY MEANS TAKEN DO YOU KNOW BOY TO ASCERTAIN IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO RESTORE LIFE
IT'S A GOODISH STRETCH SIR I COME UP IN A CAB AND THE CAB'S WAITING TO BE PAID WE COULD GO BACK IN IT BEFORE YOU PAID IT IF YOU LIKED
I CAN HAVE NO HESITATION IN REPLYING IT NOT BEING INCONSISTENT WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICE THAT THOSE ACCENTS WERE THE ACCENTS OF THE T'OTHER GOVERNOR YOU'VE TOLERABLE GOOD EYES AIN'T YOU GOVERNOR YOU'VE ALL TOLERABLE GOOD EYES AIN'T YOU
ANOTHER MAN AS THE DISAPPEARING SKIRTS OF THE LADIES ASCENDED THE VENEERING STAIRCASE MORTIMER FOLLOWING THEM FORTH FROM THE DINING ROOM TURNED INTO A LIBRARY OF BRAN NEW BOOKS IN BRAN NEW BINDINGS LIBERALLY GILDED
THANK YOU THEN IDIOTS TALK SAID EUGENE LEANING BACK FOLDING HIS ARMS SMOKING WITH HIS EYES SHUT AND SPEAKING SLIGHTLY THROUGH HIS NOSE OF ENERGY IF THERE IS A WORD IN THE DICTIONARY UNDER ANY LETTER FROM A TO Z THAT I ABOMINATE IT IS ENERGY
NOW HERE MOVING THE LIGHT TO ANOTHER SIMILAR PLACARD HIS POCKETS WAS FOUND EMPTY AND TURNED INSIDE OUT AND HERE MOVING THE LIGHT TO ANOTHER HER POCKET WAS FOUND EMPTY AND TURNED INSIDE OUT AND SO WAS THIS ONE'S AND SO WAS THAT ONE'S
IN FACT WE HAVING BEEN A FAMILY IMMERSED TO THE CROWNS OF OUR HEADS IN LIME DURING SEVERAL GENERATIONS
CAUSING IT TO SEND FORTH ONE GENTLE HISS THEN HE RESTORED THE CONTENTS TO THE JUG HELD OVER THE STEAM OF THE JUG EACH OF THE THREE BRIGHT GLASSES IN SUCCESSION FINALLY FILLED THEM ALL AND WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AWAITED THE APPLAUSE OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES IT WAS BESTOWED
DO YOU FEEL LIKE A DARK COMBINATION OF TRAITOR AND PICKPOCKET WHEN YOU THINK OF THAT GIRL RATHER RETURNED LIGHTWOOD DO YOU VERY MUCH SO THEIR ESCORT STROLLED BACK AGAIN AND REPORTED
I HAVE HAD NO SCRAP OF BUSINESS BUT THIS ROMANTIC BUSINESS AND I SAID EUGENE
THEY PRETTY WELL PAPERS THE ROOM YOU SEE BUT I KNOW EM ALL I'M SCHOLAR ENOUGH HE WAVED THE LIGHT OVER THE WHOLE AS IF TO TYPIFY THE LIGHT OF HIS SCHOLARLY INTELLIGENCE AND THEN PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE AND STOOD BEHIND IT LOOKING INTENTLY AT HIS VISITORS
NOT THE SPECIAL CAUSEWAY OF THE SIX JOLLY FELLOWSHIPS WHICH HAD A LANDING PLACE OF ITS OWN BUT ANOTHER A LITTLE REMOVED AND VERY NEAR TO THE OLD WINDMILL WHICH WAS THE DENOUNCED MAN'S DWELLING PLACE WERE A FEW BOATS SOME MOORED AND ALREADY BEGINNING TO FLOAT OTHERS HAULED UP ABOVE THE REACH OF THE TIDE
HE SPOKE IN THE SINGULAR NUMBER TO THE EXPRESS EXCLUSION OF EUGENE THIS IS A CONFOUNDEDLY OUT OF THE WAY PLACE SAID MORTIMER SLIPPING OVER THE STONES AND REFUSE ON THE SHORE AS THE BOY TURNED THE CORNER SHARP HERE'S MY FATHER'S SIR WHERE THE LIGHT IS
DOWN BY WHERE ACCUMULATED SCUM OF HUMANITY SEEMED TO BE WASHED FROM HIGHER GROUNDS LIKE SO MUCH MORAL SEWAGE AND TO BE PAUSING UNTIL ITS OWN WEIGHT FORCED IT OVER THE BANK AND SUNK IT IN THE RIVER
DIVESTED OF ITS VARIOUS LIME LIGHTS AND SHADOWS HIS REPORT WENT TO THE EFFECT THAT GAFFER WAS AWAY IN HIS BOAT SUPPOSED TO BE ON HIS OLD LOOK OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTED LAST HIGH WATER
IF THE REAL MAN FEELS AS GUILTY AS I DO SAID EUGENE HE IS REMARKABLY UNCOMFORTABLE INFLUENCE OF SECRECY SUGGESTED LIGHTWOOD
BOB GLIDDERY RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS FROM MISTER INSPECTOR AND DEPARTED IN A BECOMING STATE OF ALACRITY ENGENDERED BY REVERENCE FOR THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW IT'S A CERTAIN FACT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR THAT THIS MAN WE HAVE RECEIVED OUR INFORMATION FROM
SAID MORTIMER GLANCING RATHER SHRINKINGLY TOWARDS THE BUNK IS IT HERE TAIN'T NOT TO SAY HERE BUT IT'S CLOSE BY I DO EVERYTHING REG'LAR
EUGENE WITH A LESS WEIGHTY SENSE OF PERSONAL TROUBLE ON HIM THAN HE USUALLY HAD WOULD GO OUT WITH MISTER INSPECTOR NOTE THE SPOT AND COME BACK ON THE SHELVING BANK OF THE RIVER AMONG THE SLIMY STONES OF A CAUSEWAY
BOB CARRIED IN HIS LEFT HAND ONE OF THOSE IRON MODELS OF SUGAR LOAF HATS BEFORE MENTIONED INTO WHICH HE EMPTIED THE JUG AND THE POINTED END OF WHICH HE THRUST DEEP DOWN INTO THE FIRE SO LEAVING IT FOR A FEW MOMENTS WHILE HE DISAPPEARED AND REAPPEARED WITH THREE BRIGHT DRINKING GLASSES
PRECISELY MY VIEW OF THE CASE EUGENE BUT SHOW ME A GOOD OPPORTUNITY SHOW ME SOMETHING REALLY WORTH BEING ENERGETIC ABOUT AND I'LL SHOW YOU ENERGY AND SO WILL I SAID EUGENE
IT IS SUCH A CONVENTIONAL SUPERSTITION SUCH PARROT GABBLE WHAT THE DEUCE AM I TO RUSH OUT INTO THE STREET COLLAR THE FIRST MAN OF A WEALTHY APPEARANCE THAT I MEET SHAKE HIM AND SAY GO TO LAW UPON THE SPOT YOU DOG AND RETAIN ME OR I'LL BE THE DEATH OF YOU YET THAT WOULD BE ENERGY
MISTER INSPECTOR HASTILY FORTIFYING HIMSELF WITH ANOTHER GLASS STROLLED OUT WITH A NOISELESS FOOT AND AN UNOCCUPIED COUNTENANCE AS ONE MIGHT GO TO SURVEY THE WEATHER AND THE GENERAL ASPECT OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES THIS IS BECOMING GRIM MORTIMER SAID EUGENE IN A LOW VOICE
I AM FAR FROM BEING CLEAR AS TO THE LAST PARTICULAR RETURNED MORTIMER WITH GREAT COMPOSURE THAT I HAVE MUCH ADVANTAGE OVER YOU I HATE SAID EUGENE PUTTING HIS LEGS UP ON THE OPPOSITE SEAT I HATE MY PROFESSION
ONLY IT HAD BEEN REGARDED BY MISTER INSPECTOR AS SO UNCOMMONLY SATISFACTORY AND SO FRAUGHT WITH MYSTERIOUS VIRTUES THAT NEITHER OF HIS CLIENTS HAD PRESUMED TO QUESTION IT TWO TAPS WERE NOW HEARD ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW
IT WAS FORCED UPON ME SAID MORTIMER BECAUSE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT WE WANTED A SOLICITOR IN THE FAMILY AND WE HAVE GOT A PRECIOUS ONE THERE ARE FOUR OF US WITH OUR NAMES PAINTED ON A DOOR POST IN RIGHT OF ONE BLACK HOLE CALLED A SET OF CHAMBERS SAID EUGENE
IT PASSED INTO MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD'S MIND THAT A CHANGE OF SOME SORT BEST EXPRESSED PERHAPS AS AN INTENSIFICATION OF ALL THAT WAS WILDEST AND MOST NEGLIGENT AND RECKLESS IN HIS FRIEND HAD COME UPON HIM IN THE LAST HALF HOUR OR SO
IN A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS CLEAR AND CREEPING UP THE RIVER UNDER THEIR OWN SHORE EUGENE HAD RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW TO LOOK INTO THE DARKNESS AFTER HIM I WISH THE BOAT OF MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND HE MURMURED LYING DOWN AGAIN AND SPEAKING INTO HIS HAT
MADE OUT RIDERHOOD IN HIS BOAT AT THE SPOT AGREED ON THEY SPRANG UP CAME OUT FROM THEIR SHELTER AND WENT DOWN TO HIM WHEN HE SAW THEM COMING HE DROPPED ALONGSIDE THE CAUSEWAY SO THAT THEY STANDING ON THE CAUSEWAY COULD SPEAK WITH HIM IN WHISPERS UNDER THE SHADOWY MASS OF THE SIX JOLLY FELLOWSHIP PORTERS FAST ASLEEP
I DON'T LIKE THIS NOR I SAID LIGHTWOOD SHALL WE GO BEING HERE LET US STAY YOU OUGHT TO SEE IT OUT AND I WON'T LEAVE YOU BESIDES THAT LONELY GIRL WITH THE DARK HAIR RUNS IN MY HEAD
BLEST IF I CAN MAKE IT OUT SAID HE STARING AT THEM MAKE WHAT OUT HAVE YOU SEEN HIM NO WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN ASKED LIGHTWOOD
I HAVE BEEN EUGENE UPON THE HONOURABLE ROLL OF SOLICITORS OF THE HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY AND ATTORNEYS AT COMMON LAW FIVE YEARS AND EXCEPT GRATUITOUSLY TAKING INSTRUCTIONS ON AN AVERAGE ONCE A FORTNIGHT FOR THE WILL OF LADY TIPPINS WHO HAS NOTHING TO LEAVE
YOU'LL MAKE OUT THAT THERE'S A SPECK OF SOMETHING OR ANOTHER THERE AND YOU'LL KNOW IT'S ME AND YOU'LL COME DOWN THAT CAUSE'AY TO ME UNDERSTOOD ALL UNDERSTOOD ALL OFF SHE GOES THEN IN A MOMENT WITH THE WIND CUTTING KEENLY AT HIM SIDEWAYS HE WAS STAGGERING DOWN TO HIS BOAT
IF LAZARUS WAS ONLY HALF AS FAR GONE THAT WAS THE GREATEST OF ALL THE MIRACLES HALLOA CRIED MORTIMER TURNING ROUND WITH HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD YOU SEEM TO BE AT HOME IN THE RED SEA MY YOUNG FRIEND READ OF IT WITH TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL SAID THE BOY
IT WAS A LITTLE WINDOW OF BUT FOUR PIECES OF GLASS AND WAS NOT CURTAINED HE CHOSE IT BECAUSE THE LARGER WINDOW NEAR IT WAS IT SHOWED HIM THE ROOM AND THE BILLS UPON THE WALL RESPECTING THE DROWNED PEOPLE STARTING OUT AND RECEDING BY TURNS
FOR THEY SPOKE AS THEY CROUCHED OR LAY WITHOUT SEEING ONE ANOTHER'S FACES IN REPLY TO THE QUESTION PUT BY MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND SAID EUGENE WHO WAS LYING ON HIS BACK WITH HIS HAT ON HIS FACE
SAID EUGENE WHEN THEY WERE STANDING UNDER THE BANK ROARED AND RIVEN AT BY THE WIND THERE'S THE LIGHT OF HER FIRE I'LL TAKE A PEEP THROUGH THE WINDOW
YOU MIGHTN'T BE MUCH GIVEN TO SUPPOSING AM I TO SHOW THE WAY AS HE OPENED THE DOOR IN PURSUANCE OF A NOD FROM LIGHTWOOD AN EXTREMELY PALE AND DISTURBED FACE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THE FACE OF A MAN MUCH AGITATED A BODY MISSING
SHALL I INCOMMODE YOU IF I PUT MINE UP TOO RETURNED MORTIMER THANK YOU I HATE MINE IT WAS FORCED UPON ME SAID THE GLOOMY EUGENE BECAUSE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT WE WANTED A BARRISTER IN THE FAMILY
THE WHEELS ROLLED ON AND ROLLED DOWN BY THE MONUMENT AND BY THE TOWER AND BY THE DOCKS DOWN BY RATCLIFFE AND BY ROTHERHITHE
BEGAN EUGENE WHICH NO MAN HAS A BETTER RIGHT TO DO THAN YOURSELF YOU KNOW SAID MISTER INSPECTOR I HOPE NOT SAID EUGENE MY FATHER HAVING BEEN A SHIPPER OF LIME BEFORE ME AND MY GRANDFATHER BEFORE HIM
BUT HE GLANCED SLIGHTLY AT THEM THOUGH HE LOOKED LONG AND STEADILY AT HER
BUT THERE WERE BELLS TO WINDWARD THAT TOLD THEM OF ITS BEING ONE TWO THREE WITHOUT THAT AID THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN HOW THE NIGHT WORE BY THE FALLING OF THE TIDE RECORDED IN THE APPEARANCE OF AN EVER WIDENING BLACK WET STRIP OF SHORE
MINE SIR WHO TOLD YOU TO WRITE IT MY FATHER JESSE HEXAM IS IT HE WHO FOUND THE BODY YES SIR WHAT IS YOUR FATHER THE BOY HESITATED
HIS MOVEMENTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLANNED TO GAIN FOR HIM IN GETTING BEYOND THEIR REACH TWELVE HOURS ADVANTAGE THE HONEST MAN WHO HAD EXPENDED THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW BECAME UNEASY AND BEGAN TO COMPLAIN WITH BITTERNESS OF THE PRONENESS OF MANKIND TO CHEAT HIM HIM INVESTED WITH THE DIGNITY OF LABOUR
IF I MIGHT SO FAR PRESUME AS TO OFFER A SUGGESTION TO MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND WHOSE KNOWLEDGE OF NAVAL MATTERS FAR BE IT FROM ME TO IMPEACH EUGENE STRUCK IN WITH GREAT DELIBERATION
AND AGAIN FATHER AND ONCE AGAIN AFTER LISTENING FATHER I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU CALL ME TWICE BEFORE
THOROUGHLY USED TO HIM AS HE WAS HE FOUND SOMETHING NEW AND STRAINED IN HIM THAT WAS FOR THE MOMENT PERPLEXING THIS PASSED INTO HIS MIND AND PASSED OUT AGAIN BUT HE REMEMBERED IT AFTERWARDS
I HAD IT FIRST FROM ONE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX OF MY ACQUAINTANCE VAGUELY INDICATING MISS ABBEY WITH HIS THUMB OVER HIS SHOULDER DOWN AWAY AT A DISTANCE OVER YONDER THEN PROBABLY MISTER INSPECTOR WAS NOT QUITE UNPREPARED FOR THEIR VISIT THAT EVENING
ASKED GAFFER HEXAM STOPPING SHORT OR A BODY FOUND WHICH
THEY BURN SHERRY VERY WELL HERE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AS A PIECE OF LOCAL INTELLIGENCE PERHAPS YOU GENTLEMEN MIGHT LIKE A BOTTLE THE ANSWER BEING BY ALL MEANS
TO THE TURNING OF STEAM PADDLES TO THE CLINKING OF IRON CHAIN TO THE CREAKING OF BLOCKS TO THE MEASURED WORKING OF OARS TO THE OCCASIONAL VIOLENT BARKING OF SOME PASSING DOG ON SHIPBOARD WHO SEEMED TO SCENT THEM LYING IN THEIR HIDING PLACE
REMARKED EUGENE HE IS STILL THERE NO SAID MISTER INSPECTOR HE HAS QUITTED THOSE WORKS HE IS OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF WILL SHE BE LEFT ALONE THEN ASKED EUGENE SHE WILL BE LEFT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
YOU MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A WORSE OPINION SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AFTER BRIEF CONSIDERATION TRY IT STOP A BIT LET'S WORK IT OUT IF I WANT YOU I'LL DROP ROUND UNDER THE FELLOWSHIPS AND TIP YOU A WHISTLE
DEMANDED THE INFORMER ALL
PLACING THESE ON THE TABLE AND BENDING OVER THE FIRE MERITORIOUSLY SENSIBLE OF THE TRYING NATURE OF HIS DUTY HE WATCHED THE WREATHS OF STEAM
WITH THIS INDICATION OF HIS DEPRESSED STATE OF MIND EUGENE FELL SILENT THEY WERE ALL SILENT FOR A LONG WHILE AS IT GOT TO BE FLOOD TIDE AND THE WATER CAME NEARER TO THEM NOISES ON THE RIVER BECAME MORE FREQUENT AND THEY LISTENED MORE
IN THE MATTER OF THIS LIME I CERTAINLY HAD AN IDEA THAT IT MIGHT LIE BETWIXT THE TWO MEN I ALWAYS HAD THAT IDEA STILL I WAS FORCED TO WAIT FOR A START AND I WASN'T SO LUCKY AS TO GET A START
MORTIMER APOSTROPHIZED HIM LAUGHING QUITE HEARTILY WHEN THEY WERE ALONE AGAIN HOW CAN YOU BE SO RIDICULOUS I AM IN A RIDICULOUS HUMOUR QUOTH EUGENE I AM A RIDICULOUS FELLOW EVERYTHING IS RIDICULOUS COME ALONG
WHICH I CHERISH NEXT TO MY LIFE BEING PRESENT I THINK IT MIGHT BE A MORE AGREEABLE PROCEEDING TO THE ASSISTING BYSTANDERS THAT IS TO SAY LIME BURNERS I ALSO SAID LIGHTWOOD PUSHING HIS FRIEND ASIDE WITH A LAUGH SHOULD MUCH PREFER THAT
EUGENE VOUCHSAFED NO ANSWER BUT MADE THE PROPOSAL TO MORTIMER I'LL GO WITH YOU IF YOU LIKE SO THEY ALL THREE WENT AWAY TOGETHER IN THE VEHICLE THAT HAD BROUGHT THE BOY THE TWO FRIENDS ONCE BOYS TOGETHER AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL INSIDE SMOKING CIGARS
I ANSWER YOU SIMPLY MOST ON EM DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE HAS BEEN MUCH VIOLENCE AND ROBBERY BEFOREHAND AMONG THESE CASES I DON'T SUPPOSE AT ALL ABOUT IT RETURNED GAFFER I AIN'T ONE OF THE SUPPOSING SORT
FOR THE JOLLY FELLOWSHIP PORTERS ARE NOT THE JOLLIEST DOGS I HAVE KNOWN BUT I SUPPOSE WE ARE BEST HERE UNTIL THEY TURN US OUT WITH THE OTHER SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS AT MIDNIGHT
YOU ARE MIGHTY LEARNED TO NIGHT YOU AND YOUR INFLUENCES RETURNED EUGENE HOW LONG SHALL WE STAY HERE HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IF I COULD CHOOSE I SHOULD SAY A MINUTE REPLIED EUGENE
MORTIMER INQUIRED AS HE SOUGHT FOR HIS HAT YOU WOULDN'T ASK SIR IF YOU KNEW HIS STATE
AND THEN WE SHALL BE SEEN LOOK HERE SAID RIDERHOOD WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THIS HE MAY HAVE BEEN LURKING IN AND OUT AND JUST HOLDING HIS OWN BETWIXT TWO OR THREE BRIDGES FOR HOURS BACK WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
BUT FOR THE IMMOBILITY WITH WHICH THE INFORMER WELL USED TO THE RIVER KEPT QUIET IN HIS PLACE
UNDER ONE OF THESE LATTER EUGENE'S COMPANION DISAPPEARED
STOICAL BUT CONTRADICTORY HE MAY BE DOING SO AT THIS PRESENT TIME WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR MY BOAT'S AMONG THEM BOATS HERE AT THE CAUSE'AY
THE MESSENGER ON THE BOX BESIDE THE DRIVER LET ME SEE SAID MORTIMER AS THEY WENT ALONG
WHEN THE BOY SPOKE THESE WORDS SLIGHTINGLY OF HIS SISTER HE TOOK HIM ROUGHLY ENOUGH BY THE CHIN AND TURNED UP HIS FACE TO LOOK AT IT WELL I'M SURE SIR SAID THE BOY RESISTING I HOPE YOU'LL KNOW ME AGAIN
NEXT TIME WITH A VIEW TO OUR PEACE OF MIND WE'LL COMMIT THE CRIME INSTEAD OF TAKING THE CRIMINAL YOU SWEAR IT CERTAINLY SWORN LET TIPPINS LOOK TO IT HER LIFE'S IN DANGER
SAID EUGENE WHO KEEPS THE BOOKS AND ATTENDS TO THE WAGES A FAIR DAY'S WAGES FOR A FAIR DAY'S WORK IS EVER MY PARTNER'S MOTTO AND A VERY GOOD UN IT IS GENTLEMEN
OF THIS COMMISSION THE BARE ARMED BOB LEADING THE WAY WITH A FLAMING WISP OF PAPER SO SPEEDILY ACQUITTED HIMSELF THAT COSY SEEMED TO LEAP OUT OF A DARK SLEEP AND EMBRACE THEM WARMLY THE MOMENT THEY PASSED THE LINTELS OF ITS HOSPITABLE DOOR
I AM QUITE AS BAD SAID LIGHTWOOD SITTING UP FACING HIM WITH A TUMBLED HEAD AFTER GOING THROUGH SOME WONDERFUL EVOLUTIONS IN WHICH HIS HEAD HAD BEEN THE LOWEST PART OF HIM THIS RESTLESSNESS BEGAN WITH ME LONG AGO
YET IN SPITE OF HAVING THOSE WEIGHTS ON HIS CONSCIENCE EUGENE WAS SOMEWHAT ENLIVENED BY THE LATE SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF AFFAIRS SO WERE HIS TWO COMPANIONS ITS BEING A CHANGE WAS EVERYTHING THE SUSPENSE SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN A NEW LEASE AND TO HAVE BEGUN AFRESH FROM A RECENT DATE
THE NIGHT WAS NOT SO DARK BUT THAT BESIDES THE LIGHTS AT BOWS AND MASTHEADS GLIDING TO AND FRO THEY COULD DISCERN SOME SHADOWY BULK ATTACHED AND NOW AND THEN A GHOSTLY LIGHTER WITH A LARGE DARK SAIL LIKE A WARNING ARM WOULD START UP VERY NEAR THEM PASS ON AND VANISH
AS THE TIME SO PASSED THIS SLINKING BUSINESS BECAME A MORE AND MORE PRECARIOUS ONE
THAT PART OF THE BANK HAVING RANK GRASS GROWING ON IT THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING CLOSE WITHOUT ANY NOISE OF FOOTSTEPS IT WAS BUT TO SCRAMBLE UP A RAGGED FACE OF PRETTY HARD MUD SOME THREE OR FOUR FEET HIGH AND COME UPON THE GRASS AND TO THE WINDOW HE CAME TO THE WINDOW BY THAT MEANS
THEY WERE NOT INCLINED TO DISPUTE THIS RECOMMENDATION BUT THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THEY COULD JOIN THE WATCHERS WHEN SO DISPOSED RATHER THAN TRUST TO A VERBAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PLACE WHICH MIGHT MISLEAD
AMONG BOW SPLITS STARING INTO WINDOWS AND WINDOWS STARING INTO SHIPS THE WHEELS ROLLED ON UNTIL THEY STOPPED AT A DARK CORNER RIVER WASHED AND OTHERWISE NOT WASHED AT ALL WHERE THE BOY ALIGHTED AND OPENED THE DOOR YOU MUST WALK THE REST SIR IT'S NOT MANY YARDS
THIS IS HIM AS HAD A NASTY CUT OVER THE EYE THIS IS THEM TWO YOUNG SISTERS WHAT TIED THEMSELVES TOGETHER WITH A HANDKECHER THIS THE DRUNKEN OLD CHAP IN A PAIR OF LIST SLIPPERS AND A NIGHTCAP WOT HAD OFFERED IT AFTERWARDS COME OUT
THE FIRE WAS IN A RUSTY BRAZIER NOT FITTED TO THE HEARTH AND A COMMON LAMP SHAPED LIKE A HYACINTH ROOT SMOKED AND FLARED IN THE NECK OF A STONE BOTTLE ON THE TABLE THERE WAS A WOODEN BUNK OR BERTH IN A CORNER
GIVE ME SOME MORE OF THAT STUFF
AT THIS TIME OF THEIR WATCH THE WATER CLOSE TO THEM WOULD BE OFTEN AGITATED BY SOME IMPULSION GIVEN IT FROM A DISTANCE
THERE WAS SOMETHING ADDITIONAL TO LOOK FOR THEY WERE ALL THREE MORE SHARPLY ON THE ALERT AND LESS DEADENED BY THE MISERABLE INFLUENCES OF THE PLACE AND TIME MORE THAN AN HOUR HAD PASSED AND THEY WERE EVEN DOZING WHEN ONE OF THE THREE EACH SAID IT WAS HE AND HE HAD NOT DOZED
THAT IT WOULD BE HIGH WATER AT ABOUT ONE AND THAT IT WAS NOW BARELY TEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT WATCH AND WAIT THAT THE INFORMER WAS KEEPING WATCH AT THE INSTANT OF THAT PRESENT REPORTING BUT THAT TWO HEADS WERE BETTER THAN ONE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SECOND WAS MISTER INSPECTOR'S
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND AT ANY TIME RETURNED EUGENE COME TO ME AT MY WORKS AND YOU'LL ALWAYS FIND AN OPENING IN THE LIME KILN THANKEE SIR SAID BOB THIS IS MY PARTNER
THIS ONE WAS A SAILOR WITH TWO ANCHORS AND A FLAG AND G F T ON HIS ARM LOOK AND SEE IF HE WARN'T QUITE RIGHT THIS ONE WAS THE YOUNG WOMAN IN GREY BOOTS AND HER LINEN MARKED WITH A CROSS LOOK AND SEE IF SHE WARN'T QUITE RIGHT
