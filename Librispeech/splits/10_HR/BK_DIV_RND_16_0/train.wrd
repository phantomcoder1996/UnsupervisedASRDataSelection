I SEE SOMEBODY NOW SHE EXCLAIMED AT LAST
AN UNCOMFORTABLE SORT OF AGE NOW IF YOU'D ASKED MY ADVICE I'D HAVE SAID LEAVE OFF AT SEVEN BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW
WHEN I FASTEN MY SHAWL AGAIN THE POOR QUEEN GROANED OUT THE BROOCH WILL COME UNDONE DIRECTLY OH OH
SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY ALICE DIDN'T WANT TO BEGIN ANOTHER ARGUMENT SO SHE SAID NOTHING SEVEN YEARS AND SIX MONTHS HUMPTY DUMPTY REPEATED THOUGHTFULLY
FOR THE SHOP WAS VERY DARK TOWARDS THE END THE EGG SEEMS TO GET FURTHER AWAY
AND HOW EXACTLY LIKE AN EGG HE IS SHE SAID ALOUD STANDING WITH HER HANDS READY TO CATCH HIM FOR SHE WAS EVERY MOMENT EXPECTING HIM TO FALL
I THINK IT WAS
IT MUST COME SOMETIMES TO JAM TO DAY ALICE OBJECTED NO IT CAN'T SAID THE QUEEN IT'S JAM EVERY OTHER DAY TO DAY ISN'T ANY OTHER DAY YOU KNOW I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SAID ALICE IT'S DREADFULLY CONFUSING
JUST AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THAT WAS A NICE CRAB YOU CAUGHT SHE REMARKED AS ALICE GOT BACK INTO HER PLACE VERY MUCH RELIEVED TO FIND HERSELF STILL IN THE BOAT WAS IT I DIDN'T SEE IT SAID ALICE
THE KING WAS EVIDENTLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AT HAVING TO SIT DOWN BETWEEN THE TWO GREAT CREATURES
IN I TOLD THEM ONCE I TOLD THEM TWICE THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ADVICE I TOOK A KETTLE LARGE AND NEW
THESE MANAGED RATHER BETTER THAN THE FOOT SOLDIERS BUT EVEN THEY STUMBLED NOW AND THEN AND IT SEEMED TO BE A REGULAR RULE THAT
OH SAID ALICE SHE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO MAKE ANY OTHER REMARK AH YOU SHOULD SEE EM
THERE'S ANOTHER PORTMANTEAU FOR YOU
CRIED HUMPTY DUMPTY
THE LION SAID LYING DOWN AND PUTTING HIS CHIN ON THIS PAWS AND SIT DOWN BOTH OF YOU TO THE KING AND THE UNICORN
HIS NAME IS HAIGHA AND HE LIVES HE LIVES ON THE HILL THE KING REMARKED SIMPLY WITHOUT THE LEAST IDEA THAT HE WAS JOINING IN THE GAME WHILE ALICE WAS STILL HESITATING FOR THE NAME OF A TOWN BEGINNING WITH H
SHE SAID AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD I SHOULDN'T KNOW YOU AGAIN IF WE DID MEET HUMPTY DUMPTY REPLIED IN A DISCONTENTED TONE GIVING HER ONE OF HIS FINGERS TO SHAKE
OF COURSE I DON'T THINK SO WHY IF
IS THE GRASS PLOT ROUND A SUN DIAL I SUPPOSE SAID ALICE SURPRISED AT HER OWN INGENUITY
THEY ARE THAT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY ALSO THEY MAKE THEIR NESTS UNDER SUN DIALS ALSO THEY LIVE ON CHEESE
HUMPTY DUMPTY CRIED BREAKING INTO A SUDDEN PASSION YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING AT DOORS AND BEHIND TREES AND DOWN CHIMNEYS OR YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT
SHE'S A DEAR GOOD CREATURE HE REPEATED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF
WHY SOMETIMES I'VE BELIEVED AS MANY AS SIX IMPOSSIBLE THINGS BEFORE BREAKFAST THERE GOES THE SHAWL AGAIN THE BROOCH HAD COME UNDONE AS SHE SPOKE AND A SUDDEN GUST OF WIND
SO SHE SMILED AND SAID IF YOUR MAJESTY WILL ONLY TELL ME THE RIGHT WAY TO BEGIN I'LL DO IT AS WELL AS I CAN BUT I DON'T WANT IT DONE AT ALL GROANED THE POOR QUEEN I'VE BEEN A DRESSING MYSELF FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS
FOR A MINUTE OR TWO ALICE STOOD SILENT WATCHING HIM SUDDENLY SHE BRIGHTENED UP
IF IT COMES TO THAT OH IT NEEDN'T COME TO THAT ALICE HASTILY SAID HOPING TO KEEP HIM FROM BEGINNING THE PIECE I'M GOING TO REPEAT
I'LL FOLLOW IT UP TO THE VERY TOP SHELF OF ALL IT'LL PUZZLE IT TO GO THROUGH THE CEILING I EXPECT BUT EVEN THIS PLAN FAILED THE THING WENT THROUGH THE CEILING AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE
THAT'S ALL SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY GOOD BYE THIS WAS RATHER SUDDEN ALICE THOUGHT BUT AFTER SUCH A VERY STRONG HINT THAT SHE OUGHT TO BE GOING
ALICE SAID INDIGNANTLY TOO PROUD THE OTHER INQUIRED
THE ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDES ONLY GOT MORE EXTRAORDINARY EVERY MOMENT WHILE THE GREAT EYES ROLLED WILDLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
TO BE SURE I WAS HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID GAILY AS SHE TURNED IT ROUND FOR HIM I THOUGHT IT LOOKED A LITTLE QUEER AS I WAS SAYING THAT SEEMS TO BE DONE RIGHT
SHE SAID THAT ONE CAN'T HELP GROWING OLDER ONE CAN'T PERHAPS SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY BUT TWO CAN
AND A BEAUTIFUL ONE AS YOU SAY IT'S A PRESENT FROM THE WHITE KING AND QUEEN THERE NOW IS IT REALLY SAID ALICE QUITE PLEASED TO FIND THAT SHE HAD
AND A GOOD MANY THAT HAVEN'T BEEN INVENTED JUST YET THIS SOUNDED VERY HOPEFUL SO ALICE REPEATED THE FIRST VERSE TWAS BRILLIG
SHE ASKED AS WELL AS SHE COULD
MOUTH UNDER IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME NOW IF YOU HAD THE TWO EYES ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE NOSE FOR INSTANCE OR THE MOUTH AT THE TOP THAT
I'M NOT CERTAIN ABOUT I THINK IT'S SHORT FOR FROM HOME MEANING THAT THEY'D LOST THEIR WAY YOU KNOW AND WHAT DOES OUTGRABE MEAN WELL
SHE ADDED HOPING TO TURN HER REMARK INTO A SORT OF A COMPLIMENT SOME PEOPLE SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKING AWAY FROM HER AS USUAL HAVE NO MORE SENSE THAN A BABY
SO SHE SAT DOWN AND SAID
THE LION BEAT THE UNICORN ALL ROUND THE TOWN SOME GAVE THEM WHITE BREAD SOME GAVE THEM BROWN SOME GAVE THEM PLUM CAKE AND DRUMMED THEM OUT OF TOWN DOES THE ONE THAT WINS GET THE CROWN
HUMPTY DUMPTY WENT ON WAGGING HIS HEAD GRAVELY FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR TO GET THEIR WAGES YOU KNOW ALICE DIDN'T VENTURE TO ASK WHAT HE PAID THEM WITH
HE REMARKED TO HER AS HE MUNCHED AWAY I SHOULD THINK THROWING COLD WATER OVER YOU WOULD BE BETTER ALICE SUGGESTED OR SOME SAL VOLATILE I DIDN'T SAY THERE WAS NOTHING BETTER THE KING REPLIED
THAT THEY SEEMED TO FILL THE WHOLE FOREST ALICE GOT BEHIND A TREE FOR FEAR OF BEING RUN OVER AND WATCHED THEM GO BY SHE THOUGHT THAT IN ALL HER LIFE SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SOLDIERS SO UNCERTAIN ON THEIR FEET
THAT WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT SUBJECT AND IT WOULD BE JUST AS WELL IF YOU'D MENTION WHAT YOU MEAN TO DO NEXT AS I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T MEAN TO STOP HERE ALL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
CHAPTER FIVE WOOL AND WATER SHE CAUGHT THE SHAWL AS SHE SPOKE AND LOOKED ABOUT FOR THE OWNER IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE WHITE QUEEN CAME RUNNING WILDLY THROUGH THE WOOD WITH BOTH ARMS STRETCHED OUT WIDE
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A HISTORY OF ENGLAND THAT IS NOW TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ME I'M ONE THAT HAS SPOKEN TO A KING I AM
I BEG YOUR PARDON ALICE SAID WITH A PUZZLED AIR I'M NOT OFFENDED SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY I MEAN WHAT IS AN UN BIRTHDAY PRESENT
AS IF SHE WERE FLYING AND ALICE VERY CIVILLY WENT TO MEET HER WITH THE SHAWL I'M VERY GLAD I HAPPENED TO BE IN THE WAY ALICE SAID AS SHE HELPED HER TO PUT ON HER SHAWL AGAIN THE WHITE QUEEN ONLY LOOKED AT HER IN A HELPLESS FRIGHTENED SORT OF WAY
ALICE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO SAY ANYTHING SO AFTER A MINUTE HUMPTY DUMPTY BEGAN AGAIN THEY'VE A TEMPER SOME OF THEM
AS WITH FLUSHED CHEEKS AND DRIPPING HAIR AND HANDS SHE SCRAMBLED BACK INTO HER PLACE AND BEGAN TO ARRANGE HER NEW FOUND TREASURES
THE FISHES ANSWERED
BUT THE ODDEST PART OF IT ALL WAS THAT WHENEVER SHE LOOKED HARD AT ANY SHELF
SAID THE KING HE'S AN ANGLO SAXON MESSENGER AND THOSE ARE ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDES
HOW OLD DID YOU SAY YOU WERE ALICE MADE A SHORT CALCULATION AND SAID SEVEN YEARS AND SIX MONTHS WRONG
AND OPPOSITE TO HER WAS AN OLD SHEEP SITTING IN AN ARM CHAIR KNITTING AND EVERY NOW AND THEN LEAVING OFF TO LOOK AT HER THROUGH A GREAT PAIR OF SPECTACLES WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO BUY THE SHEEP SAID AT LAST
THAT'S THE EFFECT OF LIVING BACKWARDS THE QUEEN SAID KINDLY IT ALWAYS MAKES ONE A LITTLE GIDDY AT FIRST LIVING BACKWARDS ALICE REPEATED IN GREAT ASTONISHMENT I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING
THAT'S A GREAT DEAL TO MAKE ONE WORD MEAN ALICE SAID IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE WHEN I MAKE A WORD DO A LOT OF WORK LIKE THAT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY
SAID ALICE IT ISN'T RESPECTABLE TO BEG SAID THE KING I ONLY MEANT THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SAID ALICE
WHICH THE POOR KING WAS NEARLY SHAKING OFF HIS HEAD HE TREMBLED SO MUCH
OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY SHE REPEATED THIS ALOUD AS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HAVE SUCH A LONG WORD TO SAY OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY PEOPLE
AND STOOD FOR SOME TIME LOOKING AT HER WITH AN AIR OF THE DEEPEST DISGUST
BUT SHE SOON MANAGED TO DISTINGUISH THE UNICORN BY HIS HORN THEY PLACED THEMSELVES CLOSE TO WHERE HATTA THE OTHER MESSENGER WAS STANDING WATCHING THE FIGHT WITH A CUP OF TEA IN ONE HAND AND A PIECE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN THE OTHER
HUMPTY DUMPTY EXCLAIMED TRIUMPHANTLY YOU NEVER SAID A WORD LIKE IT
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE SAID ALICE AND HOW MANY BIRTHDAYS HAVE YOU ONE
SO THEY TROTTED ON IN SILENCE TILL THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF A GREAT CROWD IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH THE LION AND UNICORN WERE FIGHTING THEY WERE IN SUCH A CLOUD OF DUST THAT AT FIRST ALICE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHICH WAS WHICH
NO BUT I MEANT PLEASE MAY WE WAIT AND PICK SOME ALICE PLEADED IF YOU DON'T MIND STOPPING THE BOAT FOR A MINUTE
HUMPTY DUMPTY TOOK THE BOOK AND LOOKED AT IT CAREFULLY THAT SEEMS TO BE DONE RIGHT HE BEGAN YOU'RE HOLDING IT UPSIDE DOWN ALICE INTERRUPTED
AND THE MOME RATHS
HE CAN'T DO THAT
BUT GLORY DOESN'T MEAN A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT ALICE OBJECTED WHEN I USE A WORD HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID IN RATHER A SCORNFUL TONE
THAT'S FULL OF HAY HAIGHA TOOK A LARGE CAKE OUT OF THE BAG AND GAVE IT TO ALICE TO HOLD WHILE HE GOT OUT A DISH AND CARVING KNIFE
WHEN HE DID SPEAK AGAIN IT WAS IN A DEEP GROWL
BUT THERE'S ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE IN IT THAT ONE'S MEMORY WORKS BOTH WAYS I'M SURE MINE ONLY WORKS ONE WAY ALICE REMARKED I CAN'T REMEMBER THINGS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN
AND I HAVEN'T SENT THE TWO MESSENGERS EITHER
AS HIS EYES WERE STEADILY FIXED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND HE DIDN'T TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE OF HER SHE THOUGHT HE MUST BE A STUFFED FIGURE AFTER ALL
IT'S VERY GOOD JAM SAID THE QUEEN WELL I DON'T WANT ANY TO DAY AT ANY RATE YOU COULDN'T HAVE IT IF YOU DID WANT IT THE QUEEN SAID THE RULE IS JAM TO MORROW AND JAM YESTERDAY BUT NEVER JAM TO DAY
BUT TELL ME YOUR NAME AND YOUR BUSINESS MY NAME IS ALICE BUT IT'S A STUPID ENOUGH NAME HUMPTY DUMPTY INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY
I HAVEN'T INDEED ALICE SAID VERY GENTLY IT'S IN A BOOK AH WELL THEY MAY WRITE SUCH THINGS IN A BOOK HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID IN A CALMER TONE
WITH PROPER ASSISTANCE YOU MIGHT HAVE LEFT OFF AT SEVEN
EVEN IN THE MIDST OF HER TEARS CAN YOU KEEP FROM CRYING BY CONSIDERING THINGS SHE ASKED THAT'S THE WAY IT'S DONE THE QUEEN SAID WITH GREAT DECISION NOBODY CAN DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE YOU KNOW LET'S CONSIDER YOUR AGE TO BEGIN WITH
THERE'S GLORY FOR YOU
I'M NOT PROUD YOU MAY SHAKE HANDS WITH ME
IN WINTER WHEN THE FIELDS ARE WHITE I SING THIS SONG FOR YOUR DELIGHT ONLY I DON'T SING IT HE ADDED AS AN EXPLANATION
ALICE COULDN'T HELP SMILING AS SHE TOOK OUT HER MEMORANDUM BOOK AND WORKED THE SUM FOR HIM
AND KEPT REPEATING SOMETHING IN A WHISPER TO HERSELF THAT SOUNDED LIKE BREAD AND BUTTER BREAD AND BUTTER AND ALICE FELT THAT IF THERE WAS TO BE ANY CONVERSATION AT ALL SHE MUST MANAGE IT HERSELF SO SHE BEGAN RATHER TIMIDLY
ALICE ASKED VERY MUCH SURPRISED AT HIS TAKING IT SO QUIETLY
AND THEY'RE SOMETHING LIKE CORKSCREWS
AM I ADDRESSING THE WHITE QUEEN WELL YES IF YOU CALL THAT A DRESSING THE QUEEN SAID IT ISN'T MY NOTION OF THE THING AT ALL ALICE THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER DO TO HAVE
THERE REALLY ARE AND SUCH BEAUTIES YOU NEEDN'T SAY PLEASE TO ME ABOUT EM THE SHEEP SAID WITHOUT LOOKING UP FROM HER KNITTING I DIDN'T PUT EM THERE AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE EM AWAY
I'M AFRAID I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID ALICE IT GETS EASIER FURTHER ON HUMPTY DUMPTY REPLIED I SENT TO THEM AGAIN TO SAY
I SEE YOU DON'T SAID ALICE
AS THE BOAT GLIDED BY THERE WAS ALWAYS A MORE LOVELY ONE THAT SHE COULDN'T REACH THE PRETTIEST ARE ALWAYS FURTHER SHE SAID AT LAST WITH A SIGH AT THE OBSTINACY OF THE RUSHES IN GROWING SO FAR OFF
COMING ON I WISH I COULD MANAGE TO BE GLAD THE QUEEN SAID ONLY I NEVER CAN REMEMBER THE RULE YOU MUST BE VERY HAPPY LIVING IN THIS WOOD AND BEING GLAD WHENEVER YOU LIKE ONLY IT IS SO VERY LONELY HERE
SHE CORRECTED HERSELF ON SECOND THOUGHTS A BEAUTIFUL CRAVAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID
HE WENT ON WITHOUT NOTICING HER REMARK WAS WRITTEN ENTIRELY FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT
ANXIETY FOR THE QUEER CREATURE THAT WALL IS SO VERY NARROW WHAT TREMENDOUSLY EASY RIDDLES YOU ASK HUMPTY DUMPTY GROWLED OUT
ALICE ASKED DOUBTFULLY OF COURSE IT MUST HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID WITH A SHORT LAUGH MY NAME MEANS THE SHAPE I AM
HE WENT ON PUTTING HIS ARM AFFECTIONATELY ROUND HATTA'S NECK HATTA LOOKED ROUND AND NODDED AND WENT ON WITH HIS BREAD AND BUTTER WERE YOU HAPPY IN PRISON DEAR CHILD SAID HAIGHA HATTA LOOKED ROUND ONCE MORE
HOW OLD ARE YOU ALICE EXPLAINED IF I'D MEANT THAT
ONE TO FETCH AND ONE TO CARRY AT THIS MOMENT THE MESSENGER ARRIVED HE WAS FAR TOO MUCH OUT OF BREATH TO SAY A WORD
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR OF COURSE HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKED DOUBTFUL I'D RATHER SEE THAT DONE ON PAPER HE SAID
GLIDING ALONG BETWEEN BANKS SO THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO DO HER BEST
HORSES AND ALL THE KING'S MEN COULDN'T PUT HUMPTY DUMPTY IN HIS PLACE AGAIN THAT LAST LINE IS MUCH TOO LONG FOR THE POETRY SHE ADDED
WAS IT REALLY A SHEEP THAT WAS SITTING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTER RUB AS SHE COULD SHE COULD MAKE NOTHING MORE OF IT SHE WAS IN A LITTLE DARK SHOP LEANING WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE COUNTER
IN SUMMER WHEN THE DAYS ARE LONG PERHAPS YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THE SONG IN AUTUMN WHEN THE LEAVES ARE BROWN TAKE PEN AND INK
ALMOST OUT LOUD FORGETTING THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY WOULD HEAR HER DON'T STAND THERE CHATTERING TO YOURSELF LIKE THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID LOOKING AT HER FOR THE FIRST TIME
I SEE NOBODY ON THE ROAD
BUT BEFORE ALICE COULD ANSWER HIM THE DRUMS BEGAN WHERE THE NOISE CAME FROM SHE COULDN'T MAKE OUT THE AIR SEEMED FULL OF IT AND IT RANG THROUGH AND THROUGH HER HEAD TILL SHE FELT QUITE DEAFENED
IF HE SMILED MUCH MORE THE ENDS OF HIS MOUTH MIGHT MEET BEHIND SHE THOUGHT AND THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIS HEAD I'M AFRAID IT WOULD COME OFF
HUMPTY DUMPTY SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY OF COURSE YOU DON'T TILL I TELL YOU I MEANT THERE'S A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT FOR YOU
FOR THE MESSENGER KEPT SKIPPING UP AND DOWN AND WRIGGLING LIKE AN EEL AS HE CAME ALONG
THAT PARTICULAR SHELF WAS ALWAYS QUITE EMPTY THOUGH THE OTHERS ROUND IT WERE CROWDED AS FULL AS THEY COULD HOLD THINGS FLOW ABOUT SO HERE SHE SAID AT LAST IN A PLAINTIVE TONE AFTER SHE HAD SPENT A MINUTE OR SO IN VAINLY PURSUING A LARGE BRIGHT THING
AS EVERY NOW AND THEN THE OARS GOT FAST IN IT AND WOULD HARDLY COME OUT AGAIN FEATHER FEATHER THE SHEEP CRIED AGAIN TAKING MORE NEEDLES YOU'LL BE CATCHING A CRAB DIRECTLY A DEAR LITTLE CRAB THOUGHT ALICE I SHOULD LIKE THAT
PEEPING INTO THE BAG HAY THEN THE KING MURMURED IN A FAINT WHISPER ALICE WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT IT REVIVED HIM A GOOD DEAL THERE'S NOTHING LIKE EATING HAY WHEN YOU'RE FAINT
SHE CAME FLYING OUT OF THE WOOD OVER YONDER HOW FAST THOSE QUEENS CAN RUN
WHY I BEAT YOU ALL ROUND THE TOWN YOU CHICKEN THE LION REPLIED ANGRILY HALF GETTING UP AS HE SPOKE HERE THE KING INTERRUPTED TO PREVENT THE QUARREL GOING ON
SAID THE MESSENGER QUITE RIGHT SAID THE KING THIS YOUNG LADY SAW HIM TOO SO OF COURSE NOBODY WALKS SLOWER THAN YOU
FIT FOR THE DEED I HAD TO DO MY HEART WENT HOP MY HEART WENT THUMP I FILLED THE KETTLE AT THE PUMP THEN SOME ONE CAME TO ME AND SAID
AND AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE FELL OFF THE WALL IN DOING SO AND OFFERED ALICE HIS HAND SHE WATCHED HIM A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY AS SHE TOOK IT
HOWEVER NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR BREATH YOU MAY TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE TOWN I'LL WHISPER IT SAID THE MESSENGER PUTTING HIS HANDS TO HIS MOUTH IN THE SHAPE OF A TRUMPET AND STOOPING
HE PRONOUNCED IT SO AS TO RHYME WITH MAYOR I LOVE MY LOVE WITH AN H ALICE COULDN'T HELP BEGINNING BECAUSE HE IS HAPPY I HATE HIM WITH AN H BECAUSE HE IS HIDEOUS
A BELT I MEAN I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE ADDED IN DISMAY
THE LION HAD JOINED THEM WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON HE LOOKED VERY TIRED AND SLEEPY AND HIS EYES WERE HALF SHUT
I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW THE LION GROWLED OUT AS HE LAY DOWN AGAIN THERE WAS TOO MUCH DUST TO SEE ANYTHING WHAT A TIME THE MONSTER IS CUTTING UP THAT CAKE
SHE'S KEPT NONE FOR HERSELF ANYHOW SAID THE LION
I SAID YOU LOOKED LIKE AN EGG SIR ALICE GENTLY EXPLAINED
THE KING SAID WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING ROUND THAT WOOD'S FULL OF THEM
AND SPREADING OUT BOTH HIS HANDS TOWARDS HER IN AN ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDE
THAT WOULD NEVER DO YOU MUST GET IT FOR YOURSELF AND SO SAYING SHE WENT OFF TO THE OTHER END OF THE SHOP AND SET THE EGG UPRIGHT ON A SHELF I WONDER WHY IT WOULDN'T DO THOUGHT ALICE AS SHE GROPED HER WAY AMONG THE TABLES AND CHAIRS
AND A LONG WAY BEYOND IT ON EACH SIDE ALICE ADDED EXACTLY SO
WITH A KIND OF SNEEZE IN THE MIDDLE HOWEVER YOU'LL HEAR IT DONE MAYBE DOWN IN THE WOOD YONDER AND WHEN YOU'VE ONCE HEARD IT YOU'LL BE QUITE CONTENT
AND A GOOD HANDSOME SHAPE IT IS TOO WITH A NAME LIKE YOURS YOU MIGHT BE ANY SHAPE ALMOST
WITH JUST THE ENDS OF HER TANGLED HAIR DIPPING INTO THE WATER WHILE WITH BRIGHT EAGER EYES SHE CAUGHT AT ONE BUNCH AFTER ANOTHER OF THE DARLING SCENTED RUSHES I ONLY HOPE THE BOAT WON'T TIPPLE OVER SHE SAID TO HERSELF OH
THIS SOUNDED NONSENSE BUT ALICE VERY OBEDIENTLY GOT UP AND CARRIED THE DISH ROUND AND THE CAKE DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE PIECES AS SHE DID SO NOW CUT IT UP SAID THE LION
THE LITTLE FISHES ARE IN BED I SAID TO HIM I SAID IT PLAIN THEN YOU MUST WAKE THEM UP AGAIN I SAID IT VERY LOUD AND CLEAR
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE ALL THE BETTER HIS BEING PUNISHED YOU'RE WRONG THERE AT ANY RATE SAID THE QUEEN WERE YOU EVER PUNISHED ONLY FOR FAULTS SAID ALICE AND YOU WERE ALL THE BETTER FOR IT I KNOW THE QUEEN SAID TRIUMPHANTLY YES
ALICE TOOK A PIECE TO TASTE BUT IT WAS VERY DRY I DON'T THINK THEY'LL FIGHT ANY MORE TO DAY THE KING SAID TO HATTA GO AND ORDER THE DRUMS TO BEGIN AND HATTA WENT BOUNDING AWAY LIKE A GRASSHOPPER
THIS HE SAID AT LAST
SHE STARTED TO HER FEET AND SPRANG ACROSS THE LITTLE BROOK IN HER TERROR
IT CAN'T GO STRAIGHT YOU KNOW IF YOU PIN IT ALL
AND AT THAT DISTANCE TOO WHY IT'S AS MUCH AS I CAN DO TO SEE REAL PEOPLE BY THIS LIGHT ALL THIS WAS LOST ON ALICE WHO WAS STILL LOOKING INTENTLY ALONG THE ROAD SHADING HER EYES WITH ONE HAND
CLEARLY THAT IT WAS HUMPTY DUMPTY HIMSELF IT CAN'T BE ANYBODY ELSE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I'M AS CERTAIN OF IT
HUMPTY DUMPTY HOWEVER THE EGG ONLY GOT LARGER AND LARGER
IT MEANS JUST WHAT
WITH ANGRY LOOKS AT BEING INTERRUPTED IN THEIR FEAST BEFORE SHE DROPPED TO HER KNEES AND PUT HER HANDS OVER HER EARS VAINLY TRYING TO SHUT OUT THE DREADFUL UPROAR IF THAT DOESN'T DRUM THEM OUT OF TOWN SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF
AS IF HIS NAME WERE WRITTEN ALL OVER HIS FACE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN A HUNDRED TIMES EASILY ON THAT ENORMOUS FACE HUMPTY DUMPTY WAS SITTING WITH
ALICE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THE BANK OF A LITTLE BROOK WITH THE GREAT DISH ON HER KNEES
EVIDENTLY ADDRESSED TO A TREE SO SHE STOOD AND SOFTLY REPEATED TO HERSELF HUMPTY DUMPTY SAT ON A WALL HUMPTY DUMPTY HAD A GREAT FALL ALL THE KING'S
BE GOOD ENOUGH ALICE PANTED OUT AFTER RUNNING A LITTLE FURTHER TO STOP A MINUTE JUST TO GET ONE'S BREATH AGAIN I'M GOOD ENOUGH THE KING SAID
GYROSCOPE TO GIMBLE
I NEVER SAW ONE ALIVE BEFORE
SAID ALICE SEVERAL THOUSAND I SHOULD THINK FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN THAT'S THE EXACT NUMBER THE KING SAID REFERRING TO HIS BOOK
IS THAT A BARGAIN YES IF YOU LIKE SAID ALICE
HUMPTY DUMPTY REMARKED SEVERELY ALICE WAS SILENT IN SPRING WHEN WOODS ARE GETTING GREEN
HE SAID I'D GO AND WAKE THEM IF I TOOK A CORKSCREW FROM THE SHELF I WENT TO WAKE THEM UP MYSELF AND WHEN I FOUND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED I PULLED AND PUSHED
YES ALL HIS HORSES AND ALL HIS MEN HUMPTY DUMPTY WENT ON THEY'D PICK ME UP AGAIN IN A MINUTE THEY WOULD HOWEVER
IF YOU LEAVE OFF ROWING IT'LL STOP OF ITSELF SO THE BOAT WAS LEFT TO DRIFT DOWN THE STREAM AS IT WOULD TILL IT GLIDED GENTLY IN AMONG THE WAVING RUSHES AND THEN THE LITTLE SLEEVES WERE CAREFULLY ROLLED UP
FIVE MONTHS AND A DAY I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SAID ALICE CAN'T YOU THE QUEEN SAID IN A PITYING TONE TRY AGAIN
SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY AND IT'S MY TURN TO CHOOSE A SUBJECT HE TALKS ABOUT IT JUST AS IF IT WAS A GAME THOUGHT ALICE SO HERE'S A QUESTION FOR YOU
CERTAINLY SAID ALICE
TO COME AND GO ONE TO COME AND ONE TO GO
LET'S GO BACK TO THE LAST REMARK BUT ONE I'M AFRAID I CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER IT ALICE SAID VERY POLITELY IN THAT CASE WE START FRESH
AND THEY PUT ME OUT I SENT A MESSAGE TO THE FISH I TOLD THEM
SAID ALICE WHAT THAT MEANS NOW YOU TALK LIKE A REASONABLE CHILD SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKING VERY MUCH PLEASED I MEANT BY IMPENETRABILITY
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME SAY FEATHER THE SHEEP CRIED ANGRILY TAKING UP QUITE A BUNCH OF NEEDLES INDEED I DID SAID ALICE YOU'VE SAID IT VERY OFTEN AND VERY LOUD PLEASE WHERE ARE THE CRABS IN THE WATER OF COURSE SAID THE SHEEP
SHE SAID GOOD BYE ONCE MORE AND GETTING NO ANSWER TO THIS SHE QUIETLY WALKED AWAY BUT SHE COULDN'T HELP SAYING TO HERSELF AS SHE WENT
WHICH WAS NECK AND WHICH WAS WAIST EVIDENTLY HUMPTY DUMPTY WAS VERY ANGRY
THEY HAD HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF THE SUBJECT OF AGE SHE THOUGHT AND IF THEY REALLY WERE TO TAKE TURNS IN CHOOSING SUBJECTS IT WAS HER TURN NOW AT LEAST
IS A THIN SHABBY LOOKING BIRD
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR DAYS WHEN YOU MIGHT GET
HIS LEGS CROSSED LIKE A TURK ON THE TOP OF A HIGH WALL SUCH A NARROW ONE THAT ALICE QUITE WONDERED HOW HE COULD KEEP HIS BALANCE AND
I HAVEN'T PRICKED IT YET THE QUEEN SAID BUT I SOON SHALL OH OH OH
MAYHAP YOU'LL NEVER SEE SUCH ANOTHER
WHAT A FIGHT WE MIGHT HAVE FOR THE CROWN NOW THE UNICORN SAID
AND WRITE IT DOWN I WILL IF I CAN REMEMBER IT SO LONG
HE SAID AT LAST WHEN A PERSON DOESN'T KNOW A CRAVAT FROM A BELT I KNOW IT'S VERY IGNORANT OF ME ALICE SAID
NOW YOU SHALL SEE ME PIN IT ON AGAIN ALL BY MYSELF THEN I HOPE YOUR FINGER IS BETTER NOW ALICE SAID VERY POLITELY AS SHE CROSSED THE LITTLE BROOK AFTER THE QUEEN OH MUCH BETTER CRIED THE QUEEN HER VOICE RISING TO A SQUEAK AS SHE WENT ON
AND KICKED AND KNOCKED AND WHEN I FOUND THE DOOR WAS SHUT I TRIED TO TURN THE HANDLE BUT THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE IS THAT ALL ALICE TIMIDLY ASKED
JABBERWOCKY LET'S HEAR IT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY I CAN EXPLAIN ALL THE POEMS THAT WERE EVER INVENTED
BUT HUMPTY DUMPTY ONLY SHUT HIS EYES AND SAID WAIT TILL YOU'VE TRIED ALICE WAITED A MINUTE TO SEE IF HE WOULD SPEAK AGAIN
CHAPTER SEVEN THE LION AND THE UNICORN THE NEXT MOMENT SOLDIERS CAME RUNNING THROUGH THE WOOD AT FIRST IN TWOS AND THREES THEN TEN OR TWENTY TOGETHER AND AT LAST IN SUCH CROWDS
ALICE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THIS IT WASN'T AT ALL LIKE CONVERSATION SHE THOUGHT AS HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO HER IN FACT HIS LAST REMARK WAS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL THE BETTER AS IT SEEMED TO ALICE IF SHE HAD GOT SOME ONE ELSE TO DRESS HER SHE WAS SO DREADFULLY UNTIDY EVERY SINGLE THING'S CROOKED ALICE THOUGHT TO HERSELF AND SHE'S ALL OVER PINS
THEY WERE ALWAYS TRIPPING OVER SOMETHING OR OTHER AND WHENEVER ONE WENT DOWN SEVERAL MORE ALWAYS FELL OVER HIM SO THAT THE GROUND WAS SOON COVERED WITH LITTLE HEAPS OF MEN THEN CAME THE HORSES HAVING FOUR FEET
BLEW THE QUEEN'S SHAWL ACROSS A LITTLE BROOK THE QUEEN SPREAD OUT HER ARMS AGAIN AND WENT FLYING AFTER IT AND THIS TIME SHE SUCCEEDED IN CATCHING IT FOR HERSELF
SAID ALICE NOT WISHING TO BEGIN AN ARGUMENT WHY
AND TWICE AS NATURAL I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY WERE FABULOUS MONSTERS SAID THE UNICORN IS IT ALIVE IT CAN TALK SAID HAIGHA SOLEMNLY
THE UNICORN LOOKED DREAMILY AT ALICE AND SAID TALK CHILD
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE RUN HIM THROUGH WITH YOUR HORN YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T HURT HIM THE UNICORN SAID CARELESSLY AND HE WAS GOING ON WHEN HIS EYE HAPPENED TO FALL UPON ALICE HE TURNED ROUND RATHER INSTANTLY
THAT LOOKED SOMETIMES LIKE A DOLL AND SOMETIMES LIKE A WORK BOX AND WAS ALWAYS IN THE SHELF NEXT ABOVE THE ONE SHE WAS LOOKING AT AND THIS ONE IS THE MOST PROVOKING OF ALL BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT SHE ADDED AS A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK HER
I WENT AND SHOUTED IN HIS EAR HUMPTY DUMPTY RAISED HIS VOICE ALMOST TO A SCREAM
SHE FELT THAT IT WOULD HARDLY BE CIVIL TO STAY SO SHE GOT UP AND HELD OUT HER HAND GOOD BYE
ASK ANOTHER DON'T YOU THINK YOU'D BE SAFER DOWN ON THE GROUND
THE LION LOOKED AT ALICE WEARILY ARE YOU ANIMAL
THE LITTLE FISHES OF THE SEA THEY SENT AN ANSWER BACK TO ME
ALL THAT HARD STUFF TO YOU I READ IT IN A BOOK SAID ALICE BUT I HAD SOME POETRY REPEATED TO ME MUCH EASIER THAN THAT
THE KING REMARKED IN A FRETFUL TONE
ALICE LAUGHED THERE'S NO USE TRYING SHE SAID ONE CAN'T BELIEVE IMPOSSIBLE THINGS I DARESAY YOU HAVEN'T HAD MUCH PRACTICE SAID THE QUEEN WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE I ALWAYS DID IT FOR HALF AN HOUR A DAY
SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY STRETCHING OUT ONE OF HIS GREAT HANDS
IF YOU LIKE SAID THE SHEEP BUT YOU CAN'T LOOK ALL ROUND YOU UNLESS YOU'VE GOT EYES AT THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD BUT THESE AS IT HAPPENED ALICE HAD NOT GOT SO SHE CONTENTED HERSELF WITH TURNING ROUND LOOKING AT THE SHELVES AS SHE CAME TO THEM
YOU'RE SO EXACTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE THE FACE IS WHAT ONE GOES BY GENERALLY ALICE REMARKED IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE THAT'S JUST WHAT I COMPLAIN OF
AND ALICE THOUGHT WITH A SHUDDER I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE MESSENGER FOR ANYTHING BUT HE WAS VERY STIFF AND PROUD HE SAID YOU NEEDN'T SHOUT SO LOUD
AND SOMETIMES UNDER TREES BUT ALWAYS WITH THE SAME TALL RIVER BANKS FROWNING OVER THEIR HEADS OH PLEASE THERE ARE SOME SCENTED RUSHES ALICE CRIED IN A SUDDEN TRANSPORT OF DELIGHT
THERE ARE TWO MEANINGS PACKED UP INTO ONE WORD I SEE IT NOW ALICE REMARKED THOUGHTFULLY AND WHAT ARE TOVES
WHAT A LOVELY ONE ONLY I COULDN'T QUITE REACH IT AND IT CERTAINLY DID SEEM A LITTLE PROVOKING ALMOST AS IF IT HAPPENED ON PURPOSE SHE THOUGHT THAT THOUGH SHE MANAGED TO PICK PLENTY OF BEAUTIFUL RUSHES
AND THIS TIME A TEAR OR TWO TRICKLED DOWN HIS CHEEK BUT NOT A WORD WOULD HE SAY SPEAK CAN'T YOU HAIGHA CRIED IMPATIENTLY
DOUBLE E AT THIS MOMENT THE UNICORN SAUNTERED BY THEM WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS I HAD THE BEST OF IT THIS TIME HE SAID TO THE KING JUST GLANCING AT HIM AS HE PASSED
THE UNICORN WENT ON TURNING FROM HER TO THE KING NONE OF YOUR BROWN BREAD FOR ME CERTAINLY CERTAINLY THE KING MUTTERED AND BECKONED TO HAIGHA OPEN THE BAG HE WHISPERED QUICK NOT THAT ONE
TRYING TO IMITATE PETER'S CROW NO IT WASN'T JANE SAID GRAVELY
NOW WENDY UNDERSTOOD THE REAL HOOK WAS ALSO IN THE WATER HE WAS SWIMMING TO THE BOAT AND AS HIS MEN SHOWED A LIGHT TO GUIDE HIM HE HAD SOON REACHED THEM IN THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN WENDY SAW HIS HOOK GRIP THE BOAT'S SIDE
AND STAYED THERE AS IF SAYING TIMIDLY CAN I BE OF ANY USE IT WAS THE TAIL OF A KITE WHICH MICHAEL HAD MADE SOME DAYS BEFORE IT HAD TORN ITSELF OUT OF HIS HAND AND FLOATED AWAY MICHAEL'S KITE PETER SAID WITHOUT INTEREST
BUT HE THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE ASKED HIS CONSENT AS WELL AS HERS
WITH THE NECKLACE GEORGE HAD GIVEN HER
STILL SHE WOULD NOT LOOK UP THOUGH SHE WAS LISTENING EAGERLY WENDY HE CONTINUED IN A VOICE THAT NO WOMAN HAS EVER YET BEEN ABLE TO RESIST WENDY ONE GIRL IS MORE USE THAN TWENTY BOYS
VERY SOON I DON'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL AND LEARN SOLEMN THINGS HE TOLD HER PASSIONATELY I DON'T WANT TO BE A MAN O WENDY'S MOTHER IF I WAS TO WAKE UP AND FEEL THERE WAS A BEARD PETER SAID WENDY THE COMFORTER I SHOULD LOVE YOU IN A BEARD
THE ROCK WAS SLIPPERY AS A BALL AND THEY HAD TO CRAWL RATHER THAN CLIMB NEITHER KNEW THAT THE OTHER WAS COMING EACH FEELING FOR A GRIP MET THE OTHER'S ARM IN SURPRISE THEY RAISED THEIR HEADS
FATHER WENDY CRIED SHOCKED BUT STILL THE CLOUD WAS ON HIM HE KNEW HE WAS BEHAVING UNWORTHILY BUT HE COULD NOT HELP IT WE COULD LIE DOUBLED UP SAID NIBS I ALWAYS CUT THEIR HAIR MYSELF SAID WENDY
SHE THOUGHT YOU SIMPLY MUST STICK TO YOUR RULE ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE MID DAY MEAL SO THOUGH FEAR WAS UPON HER AND SHE LONGED TO HEAR MALE VOICES SHE WOULD NOT WAKEN THEM EVEN WHEN SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF MUFFLED OARS
PETER CAME NEXT SPRING CLEANING AND THE STRANGE THING WAS THAT HE NEVER KNEW HE HAD MISSED A YEAR THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THE GIRL WENDY EVER SAW HIM FOR A LITTLE LONGER SHE TRIED FOR HIS SAKE NOT TO HAVE GROWING PAINS
SHE KNEW IT WAS USELESS TO SAY THAT HE HAD LET MANY SPRING CLEANING TIMES PASS I CAN'T COME SHE SAID APOLOGETICALLY I HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO FLY I'LL SOON TEACH YOU AGAIN O PETER DON'T WASTE THE FAIRY DUST ON ME
AT ONCE D'YE HEAR CRIED PETER
GEORGE MISSUS DARLING ENTREATED HIM NOT SO LOUD THE SERVANTS WILL HEAR YOU SOMEHOW THEY HAD GOT INTO THE WAY
HIS FACE HAD GONE BLACK WITH RAGE BUT HE SAW THAT THEY BELIEVED THEIR WORDS AND HE WAS STARTLED LADS HE SAID SHAKING A LITTLE
BOY SHE SAID WHY ARE YOU CRYING PETER ROSE AND BOWED TO HER AND SHE BOWED TO HIM FROM THE BED HULLO HE SAID HULLO SAID JANE MY NAME IS PETER PAN HE TOLD HER
BRIMSTONE AND GALL THUNDERED HOOK
AN END TO ONE OF HER RACE MORE TERRIBLE THAN DEATH BY FIRE OR TORTURE FOR IS IT NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE TRIBE THAT THERE IS NO PATH THROUGH WATER TO THE HAPPY HUNTING GROUND YET HER FACE WAS IMPASSIVE SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A CHIEF SHE MUST DIE AS A CHIEF'S DAUGHTER
AND ALWAYS HAD AN ODD INQUIRING LOOK
AND WENDY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO COMFORT HIM THOUGH SHE COULD HAVE DONE IT SO EASILY ONCE SHE WAS ONLY A WOMAN NOW AND SHE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM TO TRY TO THINK PETER CONTINUED TO CRY AND SOON HIS SOBS WOKE JANE
BUT HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HIS HOOK IN A POSITION OF PROFOUND MELANCHOLY CAPTAIN IS ALL WELL THEY ASKED TIMIDLY BUT HE ANSWERED WITH A HOLLOW MOAN HE SIGHS SAID SMEE HE SIGHS AGAIN SAID STARKEY
HERE AND THERE A HEAD BOBBED UP IN THE WATER AND THERE WAS A FLASH OF STEEL FOLLOWED BY A CRY OR A WHOOP IN THE CONFUSION SOME STRUCK AT THEIR OWN SIDE THE CORKSCREW OF SMEE GOT TOOTLES IN THE FOURTH RIB
WENDY WAS SITTING ON THE FLOOR VERY CLOSE TO THE FIRE SO AS TO SEE TO DARN FOR THERE WAS NO OTHER LIGHT IN THE NURSERY AND WHILE SHE SAT DARNING SHE HEARD A CROW THEN THE WINDOW BLEW OPEN AS OF OLD
CERTAINLY SAID MISTER DARLING ARE YOU READY MICHAEL WENDY GAVE THE WORDS ONE TWO THREE AND MICHAEL TOOK HIS MEDICINE BUT MISTER DARLING SLIPPED HIS BEHIND HIS BACK
HOW EXACTLY LIKE A BOY FORTUNATELY SHE KNEW AT ONCE WHAT TO DO IT MUST BE SEWN ON SHE SAID JUST A LITTLE PATRONISINGLY WHAT'S SEWN HE ASKED
I WON'T I WON'T NANA IT ISN'T SIX O'CLOCK YET OH DEAR OH DEAR I SHAN'T LOVE YOU ANY MORE NANA I TELL YOU I WON'T BE BATHED I WON'T I WON'T THEN MISSUS DARLING HAD COME IN WEARING HER WHITE EVENING GOWN SHE HAD DRESSED EARLY BECAUSE WENDY SO LOVED TO SEE HER IN HER EVENING GOWN
A CODFISH REPLIED THE VOICE ONLY A CODFISH A CODFISH HOOK ECHOED BLANKLY AND IT WAS THEN BUT NOT TILL THEN THAT HIS PROUD SPIRIT BROKE HE SAW HIS MEN DRAW BACK FROM HIM
PETER PAN SHE WAS ALREADY SURE THAT HE MUST BE PETER BUT IT DID SEEM A COMPARATIVELY SHORT NAME IS THAT ALL YES HE SAID RATHER SHARPLY HE FELT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT IT WAS A SHORTISH NAME I'M SO SORRY SAID WENDY MOIRA ANGELA IT DOESN'T MATTER PETER GULPED
THAT WANTED HER NOT TO CALL PETER NAMES THEY WOULD SIT THERE IN THE EMPTY NURSERY RECALLING FONDLY EVERY SMALLEST DETAIL OF THAT DREADFUL EVENING
HE SAID EXAMINING IT CAREFULLY BUT IT DOES LOOK A SCOUNDREL WE WERE STILL DISCUSSING IT YOU REMEMBER SAYS MISTER DARLING WHEN NANA CAME IN WITH MICHAEL'S MEDICINE
HALLO HE SAID I AM UP MICHAEL WAS UP BY THIS TIME ALSO LOOKING AS SHARP AS A KNIFE WITH SIX BLADES AND A SAW BUT PETER SUDDENLY SIGNED SILENCE THEIR FACES ASSUMED THE AWFUL CRAFTINESS OF CHILDREN LISTENING FOR SOUNDS FROM THE GROWN UP WORLD ALL WAS AS STILL AS SALT THEN EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT
PERHAPS SHE IS HANGING ABOUT HERE TO HELP PETER HOOK WINCED AY HE SAID THAT IS THE FEAR THAT HAUNTS ME HE WAS ROUSED FROM THIS DEJECTION BY SMEE'S EAGER VOICE CAPTAIN SAID SMEE
IT WAS THE PIRATE DINGHY WITH THREE FIGURES IN HER SMEE AND STARKEY AND THE THIRD A CAPTIVE NO OTHER THAN TIGER LILY HER HANDS AND ANKLES WERE TIED AND SHE KNEW WHAT WAS TO BE HER FATE SHE WAS TO BE LEFT ON THE ROCK TO PERISH
HE SAID DOUBTFULLY AND THEY DID NOT DARE EXPOSE HIM WHEN MISSUS DARLING AND NANA RETURNED NANA GOOD DOG HE SAID PATTING HER
WHERE ARE YOU GOING SHE CRIED WITH MISGIVING TO TELL THE OTHER BOYS DON'T GO PETER SHE ENTREATED I KNOW SUCH LOTS OF STORIES
IF THERE COULD BE TWO MOMENTS YOU MIGHT SEE THE SURF AND HEAR THE MERMAIDS SINGING THE CHILDREN OFTEN SPENT LONG SUMMER DAYS ON THIS LAGOON SWIMMING OR FLOATING MOST OF THE TIME PLAYING THE MERMAID GAMES IN THE WATER AND SO FORTH
AND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WAS BORNE OUT OF HIS SIGHT PETER WAS ALONE ON THE LAGOON THE ROCK WAS VERY SMALL NOW SOON IT WOULD BE SUBMERGED PALE RAYS OF LIGHT TIPTOED ACROSS THE WATERS
WITH A VINDICTIVE POLITENESS THAT WAS QUITE THROWN AWAY UPON HER MICHAEL FIRST HE SAID DOGGEDLY FATHER FIRST SAID MICHAEL WHO WAS OF A SUSPICIOUS NATURE I SHALL BE SICK YOU KNOW MISTER DARLING SAID THREATENINGLY
AS SOON AS NANA HAD GONE INTO THE BATHROOM
THAT YOU DON'T DO THINGS BY HALVES A GRUDGING REMARK WHICH THE TWINS THOUGHT WAS POINTED AT THEM THE FIRST TWIN WAS THE PROUD ONE AND HE ASKED FLUSHING DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE TOO MUCH OF A HANDFUL SIR BECAUSE IF SO WE CAN GO AWAY
WHEN THEIR VOICES DIED AWAY THERE CAME COLD SILENCE OVER THE LAGOON AND THEN A FEEBLE CRY HELP HELP TWO SMALL FIGURES WERE BEATING AGAINST THE ROCK
WHERE ALL THIS TIME WAS PETER HE WAS SEEKING BIGGER GAME THE OTHERS WERE ALL BRAVE BOYS AND THEY MUST NOT BE BLAMED FOR BACKING FROM THE PIRATE CAPTAIN HIS IRON CLAW MADE A CIRCLE OF DEAD WATER ROUND HIM FROM WHICH THEY FLED LIKE AFFRIGHTED FISHES
NOW SAID HE SHALL I GIVE YOU A KISS AND SHE REPLIED WITH A SLIGHT PRIMNESS IF YOU PLEASE SHE MADE HERSELF RATHER CHEAP BY INCLINING HER FACE TOWARD HIM
AND THE SUN WENT AWAY AND SHADOWS STOLE ACROSS THE WATER TURNING IT COLD WENDY COULD NO LONGER SEE TO THREAD HER NEEDLE AND WHEN SHE LOOKED UP THE LAGOON THAT HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH A LAUGHING PLACE SEEMED FORMIDABLE AND UNFRIENDLY
WHAT WAS IT THERE CROWDED UPON HER ALL THE STORIES SHE HAD BEEN TOLD OF MAROONERS ROCK SO CALLED BECAUSE EVIL CAPTAINS PUT SAILORS ON IT AND LEAVE THEM THERE TO DROWN THEY DROWN WHEN THE TIDE RISES FOR THEN IT IS SUBMERGED
MIND YOU I AM NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE A DRAWING ROOM BUT WE PRETEND WE HAVE AND IT'S ALL THE SAME HOOP LA HE WENT OFF DANCING THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL CRIED HOOP LA AND DANCED AFTER HIM SEARCHING FOR THE DRAWING ROOM AND I FORGET WHETHER THEY FOUND IT
ALL THE BOYS WERE GROWN UP AND DONE FOR BY THIS TIME SO IT IS SCARCELY WORTH WHILE SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM YOU MAY SEE THE TWINS AND NIBS AND CURLY ANY DAY GOING TO AN OFFICE EACH CARRYING A LITTLE BAG AND AN UMBRELLA
DO YOU REALLY THINK SO PETER YES I DO
THEN SHE TURNED UP THE LIGHT AND PETER SAW HE GAVE A CRY OF PAIN AND WHEN THE TALL BEAUTIFUL CREATURE STOOPED TO LIFT HIM IN HER ARMS HE DREW BACK SHARPLY WHAT IS IT HE CRIED AGAIN SHE HAD TO TELL HIM
SHE USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS TO HER HUSBAND WHILE PERHAPS NANA WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER HOLDING HER HAND NO NO MISTER DARLING ALWAYS SAID I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR IT ALL I GEORGE DARLING DID IT
BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE WITH TINK IN THE HOUSE WE BUILT FOR WENDY THE FAIRIES ARE TO PUT IT HIGH UP AMONG THE TREE TOPS WHERE THEY SLEEP AT NIGHTS HOW LOVELY CRIED WENDY SO LONGINGLY THAT MISSUS DARLING TIGHTENED HER GRIP I THOUGHT ALL THE FAIRIES WERE DEAD MISSUS DARLING SAID
SHE WAS MUCH PLEASED AND BOWED BEAUTIFULLY TO HIM FROM THE BED WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
THE LOVELIEST TINKLE AS OF GOLDEN BELLS ANSWERED HIM IT IS THE FAIRY LANGUAGE YOU ORDINARY CHILDREN CAN NEVER HEAR IT
NO YOU'RE NOT YES AND THE LITTLE GIRL IN THE BED IS MY BABY NO SHE'S NOT
YES YES THEY ANSWERED EAGERLY WELL THEN HE CRIED I AM PETER PAN PAN IN A MOMENT HOOK WAS HIMSELF AGAIN AND SMEE AND STARKEY WERE HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMEN
IT WAS ALREADY HER EASIEST WAY OF MOVING ABOUT WENDY RUSHED TO THE WINDOW NO NO SHE CRIED IT IS JUST FOR SPRING CLEANING TIME JANE SAID HE WANTS ME ALWAYS TO DO HIS SPRING CLEANING
LIKE A SHUDDER PASSING OVER THE SEA BUT ON THE SEA ONE SHUDDER FOLLOWS ANOTHER TILL THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THEM AND PETER FELT JUST THE ONE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS STANDING ERECT ON THE ROCK AGAIN WITH THAT SMILE ON HIS FACE AND A DRUM BEATING WITHIN HIM IT WAS SAYING
AHOY THERE YOU LUBBERS HE CALLED IT WAS A MARVELLOUS IMITATION THE CAPTAIN SAID THE PIRATES STARING AT EACH OTHER IN SURPRISE HE MUST BE SWIMMING OUT TO US STARKEY SAID WHEN THEY HAD LOOKED FOR HIM IN VAIN
FOR JOHN INTRODUCED A NEW WAY OF HITTING THE BUBBLE WITH THE HEAD INSTEAD OF THE HAND AND THE MERMAIDS ADOPTED IT THIS IS THE ONE MARK THAT JOHN HAS LEFT ON THE NEVERLAND
BUT HE WAS NEVER ONE TO CHOOSE THE EASY WAY
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE NOW AND SOON THEY SETTLED DOWN TO BEING AS ORDINARY AS YOU OR ME OR JENKINS MINOR
THIS IS QUEER SMEE GASPED BETTER DO WHAT THE CAPTAIN ORDERS SAID STARKEY NERVOUSLY AY AY SMEE SAID AND HE CUT TIGER LILY'S CORDS AT ONCE LIKE AN EEL SHE SLID BETWEEN STARKEY'S LEGS INTO THE WATER
WE ARE PUTTING THE REDSKIN ON THE ROCK SMEE CALLED OUT SET HER FREE CAME THE ASTONISHING ANSWER FREE YES CUT HER BONDS AND LET HER GO BUT CAPTAIN
WELL THEN YOU TAKE IT WENDY HAD A SPLENDID IDEA
SHE SAID LITTLE GUESSING WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN THAT IS HER BARK WHEN SHE SMELLS DANGER DANGER ARE YOU SURE WENDY OH YES MISSUS DARLING QUIVERED AND WENT TO THE WINDOW IT WAS SECURELY FASTENED
BUT NOT SO LITTLE IF THAT WAS TO BE MICHAEL'S LAST NIGHT IN THE NURSERY THEY GO ON WITH THEIR RECOLLECTIONS IT WAS THEN THAT I RUSHED IN LIKE A TORNADO WASN'T IT MISTER DARLING WOULD SAY SCORNING HIMSELF AND INDEED HE HAD BEEN LIKE A TORNADO
YES I KNOW I CAME BACK FOR MY MOTHER HE EXPLAINED TO TAKE HER TO THE NEVERLAND YES I KNOW JANE SAID I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU WHEN WENDY RETURNED DIFFIDENTLY SHE FOUND PETER SITTING ON THE BED POST CROWING GLORIOUSLY
HOW SWEET CRIED WENDY YES I'M SWEET OH I AM SWEET SAID PETER FORGETTING HIS MANNERS AGAIN IT LOOKED DELIGHTFULLY EASY AND THEY TRIED IT FIRST FROM THE FLOOR AND THEN FROM THE BEDS BUT THEY ALWAYS WENT DOWN INSTEAD OF UP I SAY HOW DO YOU DO IT ASKED JOHN RUBBING HIS KNEE HE WAS QUITE A PRACTICAL BOY
TO WENDY'S PAIN THE ANSWER THAT RANG OUT THIS TIME WAS YES ARE YOU IN ENGLAND NO ARE YOU HERE YES HOOK WAS COMPLETELY PUZZLED
I AM OLD PETER I AM EVER SO MUCH MORE THAN TWENTY I GREW UP LONG AGO YOU PROMISED NOT TO I COULDN'T HELP IT
AGAIN WENDY FORGOT HERSELF NEVER SHE CRIED AND BOBBED WHAT WAS THAT BUT THEY COULD SEE NOTHING THEY THOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN A LEAF IN THE WIND DO YOU AGREE MY BULLIES ASKED HOOK THERE IS MY HAND ON IT THEY BOTH SAID
WENDY I RAN AWAY THE DAY I WAS BORN WENDY WAS QUITE SURPRISED BUT INTERESTED AND SHE INDICATED IN THE CHARMING DRAWING ROOM MANNER
WENDY SAID IT WITH A SMILE SHE WAS AS GROWN UP AS THAT WHAT DID HIS CROW SOUND LIKE JANE ASKED ONE EVENING IT WAS LIKE THIS WENDY SAID
THE KISS THAT HAD BEEN FOR NO ONE ELSE PETER TOOK QUITE EASILY FUNNY BUT SHE SEEMED SATISFIED OF COURSE ALL THE BOYS WENT TO SCHOOL
HOOK HE CALLED HAVE YOU ANOTHER VOICE NOW PETER COULD NEVER RESIST A GAME AND HE ANSWERED BLITHELY IN HIS OWN VOICE I HAVE AND ANOTHER NAME AY AY
THEY WERE NOT ONLY NEW TROUSERS BUT THEY WERE THE FIRST HE HAD EVER HAD WITH BRAID ON THEM
VEGETABLE ASKED HOOK NO MINERAL NO ANIMAL YES MAN NO THIS ANSWER RANG OUT SCORNFULLY
BUT SHE DID NOT NOTICE THIS NOR THAT ONE OR TWO OF THE SMALLER ONES WINKED AT HER YET A NAMELESS FEAR CLUTCHED AT HER HEART AND MADE HER CRY
HE GAVE THE PIRATE A HAND TO HELP HIM UP IT WAS THEN THAT HOOK BIT HIM NOT THE PAIN OF THIS BUT ITS UNFAIRNESS WAS WHAT DAZED PETER IT MADE HIM QUITE HELPLESS HE COULD ONLY STARE HORRIFIED
THEY WENT UP BY THE STAIR BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE A BETTER IMPRESSION THEY STOOD IN A ROW IN FRONT OF MISSUS DARLING WITH THEIR HATS OFF AND WISHING THEY WERE NOT WEARING THEIR PIRATE CLOTHES THEY SAID NOTHING BUT THEIR EYES ASKED HER TO HAVE THEM
OUR LAST GLIMPSE OF HER SHOWS HER AT THE WINDOW
AND IT IS ALL MY FAULT STRONG MAN THOUGH HE WAS THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD BEHAVED RATHER FOOLISHLY OVER THE MEDICINE IF HE HAD A WEAKNESS IT WAS FOR THINKING THAT ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD TAKEN MEDICINE BOLDLY AND SO NOW
AND PETER DROPPED IN HE HAD CARRIED TINKER BELL PART OF THE WAY AND HIS HAND WAS STILL MESSY WITH THE FAIRY DUST TINKER BELL HE CALLED SOFTLY AFTER MAKING SURE THAT THE CHILDREN WERE ASLEEP TINK WHERE ARE YOU SHE WAS IN A JUG FOR THE MOMENT AND LIKING IT EXTREMELY SHE HAD NEVER BEEN IN A JUG BEFORE
WHO WAS NO LONGER FOND OF STAIRS MISSUS DARLING WAS NOW DEAD AND FORGOTTEN THERE WERE ONLY TWO BEDS IN THE NURSERY NOW JANE'S AND HER NURSE'S AND THERE WAS NO KENNEL FOR NANA ALSO HAD PASSED AWAY
IN THE GLOOM THAT THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM THE TWO PIRATES DID NOT SEE THE ROCK TILL THEY CRASHED INTO IT LUFF YOU LUBBER CRIED AN IRISH VOICE THAT WAS S M E E HERE'S THE ROCK NOW THEN
HE HAD ONE FEELING ONLY GLADNESS AND HE GNASHED HIS PRETTY TEETH WITH JOY QUICK AS THOUGHT HE SNATCHED A KNIFE FROM HOOK'S BELT AND WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE IT HOME WHEN HE SAW THAT HE WAS HIGHER UP THE ROCK THAT HIS FOE IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FAIR
MATTER HE YELLED HE REALLY YELLED THIS TIE IT WILL NOT TIE HE BECAME DANGEROUSLY SARCASTIC
IT WAS EXACTLY AS IF SOMEONE WERE PULLING MY HAIR
WENDY DO COME WITH ME AND TELL THE OTHER BOYS OF COURSE SHE WAS VERY PLEASED TO BE ASKED BUT SHE SAID OH DEAR I CAN'T THINK OF MUMMY BESIDES I CAN'T FLY I'LL TEACH YOU OH HOW LOVELY TO FLY I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO JUMP ON THE WIND'S BACK AND THEN AWAY WE GO
SMEE ANSWERED COMPLACENTLY WE LET HER GO LET HER GO CRIED HOOK TWAS YOUR OWN ORDERS THE BO'SUN FALTERED YOU CALLED OVER THE WATER TO US TO LET HER GO SAID STARKEY
UNFORTUNATELY LIZA RETURNED TO HER PUDDINGS AND NANA SEEING THAT NO HELP WOULD COME FROM HER
THE OTHERS CAME CLOSER TO HIM A STRANGE SMILE WAS PLAYING ABOUT HIS FACE AND WENDY SAW IT AND SHUDDERED WHILE THAT SMILE WAS ON HIS FACE NO ONE DARED ADDRESS HIM
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN WHEN WENDY GREW UP I HOPE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THE OTHER BOYS THEY WERE WAITING BELOW TO GIVE WENDY TIME TO EXPLAIN ABOUT THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD COUNTED FIVE HUNDRED THEY WENT UP
AT FIRST HE POOH POOHED THE STORY BUT HE BECAME THOUGHTFUL WHEN SHE SHOWED HIM THE SHADOW
JOHN IS NOT HERE NOW SHE GASPED IS MICHAEL ASLEEP HE ASKED WITH A CARELESS GLANCE AT JANE
WE MUST GO SHE SAID ALMOST BRIGHTLY YES HE ANSWERED FAINTLY SHALL WE SWIM OR FLY PETER HE HAD TO TELL HER DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SWIM OR FLY AS FAR AS THE ISLAND WENDY
IT LOOKED SO LIKE THE WASHING AND LOWERED THE WHOLE TONE OF THE HOUSE SHE THOUGHT OF SHOWING IT TO MISTER DARLING BUT HE WAS TOTTING UP WINTER GREAT COATS FOR JOHN AND MICHAEL
BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT HIM OF COURSE MISSUS DARLING SAID AT ONCE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE THEM BUT MISTER DARLING WAS CURIOUSLY DEPRESSED AND THEY SAW THAT HE CONSIDERED SIX A RATHER LARGE NUMBER I MUST SAY HE SAID TO WENDY
AND THERE IS MY HOOK SWEAR THEY ALL SWORE BY THIS TIME THEY WERE ON THE ROCK AND SUDDENLY HOOK REMEMBERED TIGER LILY WHERE IS THE REDSKIN HE DEMANDED ABRUPTLY
BUT FOR THE MOMENT WENDY WAS SHOCKED
HE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS EVER AND WENDY SAW AT ONCE THAT HE STILL HAD ALL HIS FIRST TEETH HE WAS A LITTLE BOY AND SHE WAS GROWN UP SHE HUDDLED BY THE FIRE NOT DARING TO MOVE HELPLESS AND GUILTY
HE LURED HER OUT OF IT WITH HONEYED WORDS AND SEIZING HER ROUGHLY DRAGGED HER FROM THE NURSERY
THERE YOU SUSPICIOUS BRUTE SHE SAID NOT SORRY THAT NANA WAS IN DISGRACE THEY ARE PERFECTLY SAFE AREN'T THEY EVERY ONE OF THE LITTLE ANGELS SOUND ASLEEP IN BED LISTEN TO THEIR GENTLE BREATHING HERE MICHAEL ENCOURAGED BY HIS SUCCESS BREATHED SO LOUDLY THAT THEY WERE NEARLY DETECTED
HE SAID AND OF COURSE THE LADY IN THE EVENING DRESS COULD NOT STAND THAT I DO SHE SAID I SO WANT A THIRD CHILD BOY OR GIRL ASKED MICHAEL NOT TOO HOPEFULLY BOY THEN HE HAD LEAPT INTO HER ARMS
WHILE JANE IN HER NIGHTY WAS FLYING ROUND THE ROOM IN SOLEMN ECSTASY SHE IS MY MOTHER PETER EXPLAINED AND JANE DESCENDED AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE WITH THE LOOK IN HER FACE THAT HE LIKED TO SEE ON LADIES WHEN THEY GAZED AT HIM
PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME EXCUSE FOR HIM HE TOO HAD BEEN DRESSING FOR THE PARTY AND ALL HAD GONE WELL WITH HIM
HE ROARED WHILE SHE COMFORTED HER BOYS AND WENDY HUGGED NANA MUCH GOOD HE SAID BITTERLY MY WEARING MYSELF TO THE BONE TRYING TO BE FUNNY IN THIS HOUSE AND STILL WENDY HUGGED NANA
HE DOES SO NEED A MOTHER JANE SAID YES I KNOW WENDY ADMITTED RATHER FORLORNLY NO ONE KNOWS IT SO WELL AS I GOOD BYE SAID PETER TO WENDY AND HE ROSE IN THE AIR AND THE SHAMELESS JANE ROSE WITH HIM
SURELY YOU KNOW WHAT A KISS IS SHE ASKED AGHAST
IT MADE THIS LIGHT BY FLASHING ABOUT SO QUICKLY
TINK SAID THAT THE SHADOW WAS IN THE BIG BOX SHE MEANT THE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND PETER JUMPED AT THE DRAWERS SCATTERING THEIR CONTENTS TO THE FLOOR WITH BOTH HANDS AS KINGS TOSS HA'PENCE TO THE CROWD
THAT IS WHAT SHE DID HULLO WENDY GOOD BYE HE SAID OH DEAR ARE YOU GOING AWAY YES YOU DON'T FEEL PETER SHE SAID FALTERINGLY
WITH MICHAEL ON HIS BACK HOW WILDLY WE ROMPED SAYS MISSUS DARLING NOW RECALLING IT OUR LAST ROMP MISTER DARLING GROANED
BUT NO ANSWER CAME SAVE MOCKING LAUGHTER FROM THE MERMAIDS THEY MUST BE SWIMMING BACK OR FLYING THE BOYS CONCLUDED THEY WERE NOT VERY ANXIOUS BECAUSE THEY HAD SUCH FAITH IN PETER THEY CHUCKLED BOYLIKE
IT WAS NOT SHE KNEW THAT NIGHT HAD COME BUT SOMETHING AS DARK AS NIGHT HAD COME NO WORSE THAN THAT IT HAD NOT COME BUT IT HAD SENT THAT SHIVER THROUGH THE SEA TO SAY THAT IT WAS COMING
SHE REPLIED FAINTLY SQUEEZING HERSELF AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE SOMETHING INSIDE HER WAS CRYING WOMAN WOMAN LET GO OF ME HULLO WHERE IS JOHN HE ASKED SUDDENLY MISSING THE THIRD BED
IN TIME THEY COULD NOT EVEN FLY AFTER THEIR HATS WANT OF PRACTICE THEY CALLED IT BUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANT WAS THAT THEY NO LONGER BELIEVED MICHAEL BELIEVED LONGER THAN THE OTHER BOYS
I DON'T THINK I SEE ANYTHING TO NIGHT SAYS WENDY WITH A FEELING THAT IF NANA WERE HERE SHE WOULD OBJECT TO FURTHER CONVERSATION YES YOU DO SAYS JANE
SHE LOOKED OUT AND THE NIGHT WAS PEPPERED WITH STARS
IT WILL SOON BE OVER FATHER JOHN SAID CHEERILY AND THEN IN RUSHED WENDY WITH THE MEDICINE IN A GLASS I HAVE BEEN AS QUICK AS I COULD
WHEN SHE STOLE SOFTLY TO THE EDGE OF THE LAGOON SHE MIGHT SEE THEM BY THE SCORE ESPECIALLY ON MAROONERS ROCK WHERE THEY LOVED TO BASK COMBING OUT THEIR HAIR IN A LAZY WAY THAT QUITE IRRITATED HER OR SHE MIGHT EVEN SWIM ON TIPTOE AS IT WERE TO WITHIN A YARD OF THEM
IS MUCH NASTIER ISN'T IT EVER SO MUCH NASTIER MISTER DARLING SAID BRAVELY AND I WOULD TAKE IT NOW AS AN EXAMPLE TO YOU MICHAEL
HIS PROUD HEART WAS NEARLY BURSTING AND IT ISN'T FAIR
THE BUBBLES OF MANY COLOURS MADE IN RAINBOW WATER THEY TREAT AS BALLS HITTING THEM GAILY FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WITH THEIR TAILS
THOUGH HER HEART WAS IN HER MOUTH SHE DID NOT WAKEN THEM SHE STOOD OVER THEM TO LET THEM HAVE THEIR SLEEP OUT WAS IT NOT BRAVE OF WENDY IT WAS WELL FOR THOSE BOYS THEN THAT THERE WAS ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD SNIFF DANGER EVEN IN HIS SLEEP PETER
NOT ONE OF THEM COULD FLY AN INCH THOUGH EVEN MICHAEL WAS IN WORDS OF TWO SYLLABLES AND PETER DID NOT KNOW A FROM Z
AGAIN MISSUS DARLING SCREAMED THIS TIME IN DISTRESS FOR HIM FOR SHE THOUGHT HE WAS KILLED AND SHE RAN DOWN INTO THE STREET TO LOOK FOR HIS LITTLE BODY BUT IT WAS NOT THERE AND SHE LOOKED UP AND IN THE BLACK NIGHT SHE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS A SHOOTING STAR
BUT NEXT MOMENT HE HAD SEIZED THE TAIL AND WAS PULLING THE KITE TOWARD HIM IT LIFTED MICHAEL OFF THE GROUND HE CRIED WHY SHOULD IT NOT CARRY YOU BOTH OF US IT CAN'T LIFT TWO MICHAEL AND CURLY TRIED
OH THE STORIES I COULD TELL TO THE BOYS SHE CRIED
THAT IS NOT MICHAEL SHE SAID QUICKLY LEST A JUDGMENT SHOULD FALL ON HER PETER LOOKED HULLO IS IT A NEW ONE YES BOY OR GIRL GIRL NOW SURELY HE WOULD UNDERSTAND BUT NOT A BIT OF IT
YOU SEE THAT JUDGE IN A WIG COMING OUT AT THE IRON DOOR THAT USED TO BE TOOTLES THE BEARDED MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANY STORY TO TELL HIS CHILDREN
AND I'LL GET UP AGAIN AND SHE SAT WITH HIM ON THE SIDE OF THE BED
AND IT SEEMED A SHAME TO TROUBLE HIM BESIDES SHE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WOULD SAY IT ALL COMES OF HAVING A DOG FOR A NURSE SHE DECIDED TO ROLL THE SHADOW UP AND PUT IT AWAY CAREFULLY IN A DRAWER UNTIL A FITTING OPPORTUNITY CAME FOR TELLING HER HUSBAND
TINK CALLED OUT FROM SOMEWHERE ROUND THE CORNER IT DOESN'T MATTER PETER SAID O PETER YOU KNOW IT MATTERS
NO ONE EVER GETS OVER THE FIRST UNFAIRNESS NO ONE EXCEPT PETER HE OFTEN MET IT BUT HE ALWAYS FORGOT IT I SUPPOSE THAT WAS THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND ALL THE REST SO WHEN HE MET IT NOW IT WAS LIKE THE FIRST TIME
IF YOU LIKE HE SAID INDIFFERENTLY AND SHE RAN TO JOHN AND MICHAEL AND SHOOK THEM WAKE UP SHE CRIED PETER PAN HAS COME AND HE IS TO TEACH US TO FLY JOHN RUBBED HIS EYES
WENDY HAD NEVER SEEN THE LAGOON BY MOONLIGHT LESS FROM FEAR
AS THEY LAY SIDE BY SIDE A MERMAID CAUGHT WENDY BY THE FEET AND BEGAN PULLING HER SOFTLY INTO THE WATER
MAY I MUMMY CERTAINLY NOT I HAVE GOT YOU HOME AGAIN AND I MEAN TO KEEP YOU BUT HE DOES SO NEED A MOTHER SO DO YOU MY LOVE OH ALL RIGHT PETER SAID AS IF HE HAD ASKED HER FROM POLITENESS MERELY
AND SNAPPED IT OFF YOU MAY BE SURE MISSUS DARLING EXAMINED THE SHADOW CAREFULLY
WHY TINK AGAIN TINK REPLIED YOU SILLY ASS PETER COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY BUT WENDY UNDERSTOOD
O PETER NO WONDER YOU WERE CRYING SHE SAID AND GOT OUT OF BED AND RAN TO HIM
CUT LOW AND SQUARE THROUGH WHICH HER FIGURE COULD BE SEEN TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE
HOWEVER JOHN CONTINUED TO SLEEP SO PLACIDLY ON THE FLOOR THAT SHE ALLOWED HIM TO REMAIN THERE AND I KNOW YOU MEANT TO BE KIND SHE SAID RELENTING
AND THEN IT WAS WENDY'S PART TO PUT JANE TO BED THAT WAS THE TIME FOR STORIES IT WAS JANE'S INVENTION TO RAISE THE SHEET OVER HER MOTHER'S HEAD AND HER OWN THUS MAKING A TENT
WENDY WAS CRYING FOR IT WAS THE FIRST TRAGEDY SHE HAD SEEN PETER HAD SEEN MANY TRAGEDIES BUT HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM ALL HE WAS LESS SORRY THAN WENDY FOR TIGER LILY IT WAS TWO AGAINST ONE THAT ANGERED HIM AND HE MEANT TO SAVE HER
SHE RETURNED TO THE NURSERY AND FOUND NANA WITH SOMETHING IN HER MOUTH WHICH PROVED TO BE THE BOY'S SHADOW
OF COURSE SHE SHOULD HAVE ROUSED THE CHILDREN AT ONCE NOT MERELY BECAUSE OF THE UNKNOWN THAT WAS STALKING TOWARD THEM BUT BECAUSE IT WAS NO LONGER GOOD FOR THEM TO SLEEP ON A ROCK GROWN CHILLY BUT SHE WAS A YOUNG MOTHER AND SHE DID NOT KNOW THIS
AND FATHER AND MOTHER DARLING PICKED THEIR WAY OVER IT DEFTLY NOT TO SOIL THEIR SHOES THEY WERE ALREADY THE ONLY PERSONS IN THE STREET AND ALL THE STARS WERE WATCHING THEM STARS ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT THEY MAY NOT TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN ANYTHING THEY MUST JUST LOOK ON FOR EVER
AND USED A MADE UP TIE THIS WAS SUCH AN OCCASION HE CAME RUSHING INTO THE NURSERY WITH THE CRUMPLED LITTLE BRUTE OF A TIE IN HIS HAND
SHE SAW HIS EVIL SWARTHY FACE AS HE ROSE DRIPPING FROM THE WATER AND QUAKING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SWIM AWAY BUT PETER WOULD NOT BUDGE HE WAS TINGLING WITH LIFE AND ALSO TOP HEAVY WITH CONCEIT AM I NOT A WONDER
THE SOUND CAME FROM THE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND PETER MADE A MERRY FACE
CHAPTER TWO THE SHADOW MISSUS DARLING SCREAMED AND AS IF IN ANSWER TO A BELL THE DOOR OPENED AND NANA ENTERED RETURNED FROM HER EVENING OUT SHE GROWLED AND SPRANG AT THE BOY WHO LEAPT LIGHTLY THROUGH THE WINDOW
FORTUNATELY AS WE HAVE MENTIONED ONE OF HIS HANDS WAS MESSY WITH IT AND HE BLEW SOME ON EACH OF THEM WITH THE MOST SUPERB RESULTS NOW JUST WIGGLE YOUR SHOULDERS THIS WAY HE SAID AND LET GO THEY WERE ALL ON THEIR BEDS AND GALLANT MICHAEL LET GO FIRST
LIKE THE FACES ON A BAD COINAGE IF ONLY I HAD NOT ACCEPTED THAT INVITATION TO DINE AT TWENTY SEVEN MISSUS DARLING SAID IF ONLY I HAD NOT POURED MY MEDICINE INTO NANA'S BOWL SAID MISTER DARLING IF ONLY I HAD PRETENDED TO LIKE THE MEDICINE
WITHOUT MY HELP SHE HAD TO ADMIT THAT SHE WAS TOO TIRED HE MOANED WHAT IS IT SHE ASKED ANXIOUS ABOUT HIM AT ONCE I CAN'T HELP YOU WENDY HOOK WOUNDED ME I CAN NEITHER FLY NOR SWIM
SHE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THRILLING TALKS WITH HIM ABOUT OLD TIMES BUT NEW ADVENTURES HAD CROWDED THE OLD ONES FROM HIS MIND WHO IS CAPTAIN HOOK
SHE DIED OF OLD AGE AND AT THE END SHE HAD BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET ON WITH BEING VERY FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT NO ONE KNEW HOW TO LOOK AFTER CHILDREN EXCEPT HERSELF ONCE A WEEK JANE'S NURSE HAD HER EVENING OFF
SECOND TO THE RIGHT SAID PETER AND THEN STRAIGHT ON TILL MORNING WHAT A FUNNY ADDRESS PETER HAD A SINKING FOR THE FIRST TIME HE FELT THAT PERHAPS IT WAS A FUNNY ADDRESS NO IT ISN'T HE SAID I MEAN WENDY SAID NICELY REMEMBERING THAT SHE WAS HOSTESS IS THAT WHAT THEY PUT ON THE LETTERS
MISTER DARLING WAS FRIGHTFULLY ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
YOU MUST NOT THINK FROM THIS THAT THE MERMAIDS WERE ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THEM ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS AMONG WENDY'S LASTING REGRETS THAT ALL THE TIME SHE WAS ON THE ISLAND SHE NEVER HAD A CIVIL WORD FROM ONE OF THEM
THOUGH THEY JEERED AT HIM SO HE WAS WITH WENDY WHEN PETER CAME FOR HER AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR SHE FLEW AWAY WITH PETER IN THE FROCK SHE HAD WOVEN FROM LEAVES AND BERRIES IN THE NEVERLAND AND HER ONE FEAR WAS THAT HE MIGHT NOTICE HOW SHORT IT HAD BECOME BUT HE NEVER NOTICED HE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT HIMSELF
NANA WAGGED HER TAIL RAN TO THE MEDICINE AND BEGAN LAPPING IT THEN SHE GAVE MISTER DARLING SUCH A LOOK NOT AN ANGRY LOOK SHE SHOWED HIM THE GREAT RED TEAR THAT MAKES US SO SORRY FOR NOBLE DOGS AND CREPT INTO HER KENNEL
OF COURSE WENDY WAS VERY ELATED OVER PETER'S CLEVERNESS BUT SHE KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE ELATED ALSO AND VERY LIKELY CROW AND THUS BETRAY HIMSELF SO AT ONCE HER HAND WENT OUT TO COVER HIS MOUTH BUT IT WAS STAYED EVEN IN THE ACT FOR
BUT THE MOMENT THE CHILDREN TRIED TO JOIN IN THEY HAD TO PLAY BY THEMSELVES FOR THE MERMAIDS IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED NEVERTHELESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY SECRETLY WATCHED THE INTERLOPERS AND WERE NOT ABOVE TAKING AN IDEA FROM THEM
AND SHE SPRANG IN THE MOST DIGNIFIED WAY INTO BED AND COVERED HER FACE WITH THE BLANKETS
BUT THIS MAN THOUGH HE KNEW ABOUT STOCKS AND SHARES HAD NO REAL MASTERY OF HIS TIE SOMETIMES THE THING YIELDED TO HIM WITHOUT A CONTEST
NANA KNEW THAT KIND OF BREATHING AND SHE TRIED TO DRAG HERSELF OUT OF LIZA'S CLUTCHES BUT LIZA WAS DENSE NO MORE OF IT NANA SHE SAID STERNLY PULLING HER OUT OF THE ROOM
THE FIGHT WAS SHORT AND SHARP FIRST TO DRAW BLOOD WAS JOHN WHO GALLANTLY CLIMBED INTO THE BOAT AND HELD STARKEY THERE WAS FIERCE STRUGGLE IN WHICH THE CUTLASS WAS TORN FROM THE PIRATE'S GRASP HE WRIGGLED OVERBOARD AND JOHN LEAPT AFTER HIM THE DINGHY DRIFTED AWAY
AND HE WAS NOW JUMPING ABOUT IN THE WILDEST GLEE
OF COURSE MISSUS DARLING BRUSHED HIM BUT HE BEGAN TO TALK AGAIN ABOUT ITS BEING A MISTAKE TO HAVE A DOG FOR A NURSE GEORGE NANA IS A TREASURE NO DOUBT BUT I HAVE AN UNEASY FEELING AT TIMES THAT SHE LOOKS UPON THE CHILDREN AS PUPPIES OH NO
I FLEWED HE SCREAMED WHILE STILL IN MID AIR JOHN LET GO AND MET WENDY NEAR THE BATHROOM
THEY ARE NOW EMBARKED ON THE GREAT ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WHEN PETER FLEW IN LOOKING FOR HIS SHADOW
YES THAT WAS IT SAYS JANE WITH A BIG BREATH AND THEN HE FLEW US ALL AWAY TO THE NEVERLAND AND THE FAIRIES AND THE PIRATES AND THE REDSKINS AND THE MERMAID'S LAGOON
WAS WHAT NANA'S WET EYES SAID MY LIKING FOR PARTIES GEORGE MY FATAL GIFT OF HUMOUR DEAREST MY TOUCHINESS ABOUT TRIFLES DEAR MASTER AND MISTRESS
WENDY'S HEART WENT FLUTTER WITH A SUDDEN THRILL PETER SHE CRIED CLUTCHING HIM
HOW COULD SHE RESIST OF COURSE IT'S AWFULLY FASCINATING SHE CRIED
YOU JUST THINK LOVELY WONDERFUL THOUGHTS PETER EXPLAINED AND THEY LIFT YOU UP IN THE AIR HE SHOWED THEM AGAIN YOU'RE SO NIPPY AT IT JOHN SAID COULDN'T YOU DO IT VERY SLOWLY ONCE PETER DID IT BOTH SLOWLY AND QUICKLY I'VE GOT IT NOW WENDY CRIED JOHN BUT SOON HE FOUND HE HAD NOT
BUT HE HAD TO TELL HER THE TRUTH WE ARE ON THE ROCK WENDY HE SAID BUT IT IS GROWING SMALLER SOON THE WATER WILL BE OVER IT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND EVEN NOW
HE HAD A PLAYFUL HUMOUR AT MOMENTS AND THEY THOUGHT THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOMENTS
FOR A MOMENT AFTER MISTER AND MISSUS DARLING LEFT THE HOUSE THE NIGHT LIGHTS BY THE BEDS OF THE THREE CHILDREN CONTINUED TO BURN CLEARLY
WHICH CRAVED FOR ADMIRATION WHEN HE HAD TIED HER UP IN THE BACK YARD THE WRETCHED FATHER WENT AND SAT IN THE PASSAGE WITH HIS KNUCKLES TO HIS EYES IN THE MEANTIME MISSUS DARLING HAD PUT THE CHILDREN TO BED IN UNWONTED SILENCE AND LIT THEIR NIGHT LIGHTS
BUT SMEE AND STARKEY CLUNG TO EACH OTHER IN TERROR WHO ARE YOU STRANGER SPEAK HOOK DEMANDED I AM JAMES HOOK REPLIED THE VOICE CAPTAIN OF THE JOLLY ROGER YOU ARE NOT YOU ARE NOT HOOK CRIED HOARSELY
OF COURSE I DID NOTHING YOU DID A LITTLE PETER SAID CARELESSLY AND CONTINUED TO DANCE
IT IS ENOUGH THEY HAD CAUGHT HER BOARDING THE PIRATE SHIP WITH A KNIFE IN HER MOUTH NO WATCH WAS KEPT ON THE SHIP IT BEING HOOK'S BOAST THAT THE WIND OF HIS NAME GUARDED THE SHIP FOR A MILE AROUND NOW HER FATE WOULD HELP TO GUARD IT ALSO
AND THEIR BODIES GLISTENED IN IT WHILE SHE SAT BESIDE THEM AND LOOKED IMPORTANT IT WAS ONE SUCH DAY AND THEY WERE ALL ON MAROONERS ROCK THE ROCK WAS NOT MUCH LARGER THAN THEIR GREAT BED BUT OF COURSE THEY ALL KNEW HOW NOT TO TAKE UP MUCH ROOM AND THEY WERE DOZING
IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY YOU ARE WAITING SO AM I WAITING FATHER'S A COWARDLY CUSTARD SO ARE YOU A COWARDLY CUSTARD I'M NOT FRIGHTENED NEITHER AM I FRIGHTENED WELL THEN TAKE IT
PETER PULLED HER BENEATH THE WATER FOR HOOK HAD STARTED UP CRYING WHAT WAS THAT I HEARD NOTHING SAID STARKEY RAISING THE LANTERN OVER THE WATERS AND AS THE PIRATES LOOKED THEY SAW A STRANGE SIGHT IT WAS THE NEST I HAVE TOLD YOU OF
WHEN MICHAEL DODGED THE SPOON IN NANA'S MOUTH HE HAD SAID REPROVINGLY
THAN A LITTLE DUST IN THE BOX IN WHICH SHE HAD KEPT HER TOYS WENDY WAS GROWN UP YOU NEED NOT BE SORRY FOR HER SHE WAS ONE OF THE KIND THAT LIKES TO GROW UP IN THE END SHE GREW UP OF HER OWN FREE WILL A DAY QUICKER THAN OTHER GIRLS
OR AT LEAST LYING WITH THEIR EYES SHUT AND PINCHING OCCASIONALLY WHEN THEY THOUGHT WENDY WAS NOT LOOKING SHE WAS VERY BUSY STITCHING WHILE SHE STITCHED A CHANGE CAME TO THE LAGOON LITTLE SHIVERS RAN OVER IT
YOU ASK HIM SOME QUESTIONS HE SAID TO THE OTHERS WIPING HIS DAMP BROW SMEE REFLECTED I CAN'T THINK OF A THING HE SAID REGRETFULLY CAN'T GUESS CAN'T GUESS CROWED PETER DO YOU GIVE IT UP
BUT THERE WAS ONE WHO DID NOT FEAR HIM THERE WAS ONE PREPARED TO ENTER THAT CIRCLE STRANGELY IT WAS NOT IN THE WATER THAT THEY MET HOOK ROSE TO THE ROCK TO BREATHE AND AT THE SAME MOMENT PETER SCALED IT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
LET THEM HE ANSWERED RECKLESSLY BRING IN THE WHOLE WORLD BUT I REFUSE TO ALLOW THAT DOG TO LORD IT IN MY NURSERY FOR AN HOUR LONGER THE CHILDREN WEPT AND NANA RAN TO HIM BESEECHINGLY BUT HE WAVED HER BACK HE FELT HE WAS A STRONG MAN AGAIN
AND BY AND BY THERE WAS TO BE HEARD A SOUND AT ONCE THE MOST MUSICAL AND THE MOST MELANCHOLY IN THE WORLD THE MERMAIDS CALLING TO THE MOON PETER WAS NOT QUITE LIKE OTHER BOYS BUT HE WAS AFRAID AT LAST A TREMOUR RAN THROUGH HIM
THERE WAS A COMMOTION IN THE FIRMAMENT
OH DEAR SAID THE NICE WENDY I DON'T MEAN A KISS I MEAN A THIMBLE WHAT'S THAT IT'S LIKE THIS SHE KISSED HIM FUNNY SAID PETER GRAVELY NOW SHALL I GIVE YOU A THIMBLE IF YOU WISH TO SAID WENDY KEEPING HER HEAD ERECT THIS TIME
SHE WAS HERE JUST NOW HE SAID A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY YOU DON'T HEAR HER DO YOU AND THEY BOTH LISTENED THE ONLY SOUND I HEAR SAID WENDY IS LIKE A TINKLE OF BELLS
THE GIRL HAD FAINTED AND LAY ON THE BOY'S ARM WITH A LAST EFFORT PETER PULLED HER UP THE ROCK AND THEN LAY DOWN BESIDE HER EVEN AS HE ALSO FAINTED HE SAW THAT THE WATER WAS RISING HE KNEW THAT THEY WOULD SOON BE DROWNED BUT HE COULD DO NO MORE
WHAT IS IT HE CRIED SHRINKING
HE HAD HAD A CLASSICAL EDUCATION THEY SAT THUS NIGHT AFTER NIGHT RECALLING THAT FATAL FRIDAY TILL EVERY DETAIL OF IT WAS STAMPED ON THEIR BRAINS
IT WAS LIKE AN EXAMINATION PAPER THAT ASKS GRAMMAR WHEN WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ASKED IS KINGS OF ENGLAND I DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED UNEASILY BUT I AM QUITE YOUNG
AND FULL OF WRAUTH BENT ON HIS ENEMIES AT ONCE THE FOUR SPRED OUT THIR STARRIE WINGS WITH DREADFUL SHADE CONTIGUOUS AND THE ORBES OF HIS FIERCE CHARIOT ROWLD AS WITH THE SOUND OF TORRENT FLOODS OR OF A NUMEROUS HOST

THUS EVE HER NIGHT RELATED AND THUS ADAM ANSWERD SAD BEST IMAGE OF MY SELF AND DEARER HALF THE TROUBLE OF THY THOUGHTS THIS NIGHT IN SLEEP AFFECTS ME EQUALLY
IF OTHER HIDDEN CAUSE LEFT THEM SUPERIOUR WHILE WE CAN PRESERVE UNHURT OUR MINDES AND UNDERSTANDING SOUND DUE SEARCH AND CONSULTATION WILL DISCLOSE
WHICH IN THE AIR CAME SHADOWING AND OPPREST WHOLE LEGIONS ARM'D THIR ARMOR HELP'D THIR HARM

WE LOSE THE PRIME TO MARK HOW SPRING OUR TENDED PLANTS HOW BLOWS THE CITRON GROVE WHAT DROPS THE MYRRHE AND WHAT THE BALMIE REED
BUT KNOWN AS SOON CONTEMND SINCE NOW WE FIND THIS OUR EMPYREAL FORME INCAPABLE OF MORTAL INJURIE IMPERISHABLE AND THOUGH PEIRC'D WITH WOUND SOON CLOSING AND BY NATIVE VIGOUR HEAL'D
SO TO THE SILVAN LODGE THEY CAME THAT LIKE POMONA'S ARBOUR SMIL'D WITH FLOURETS DECK'T AND FRAGRANT SMELLS BUT EVE UNDECKT SAVE WITH HER SELF MORE LOVELY FAIR THEN WOOD NYMPH OR THE FAIREST GODDESS FEIGN'D OF THREE
BUT HONOURD MORE HERE HAPPIE CREATURE FAIR ANGELIC EVE PARTAKE THOU ALSO HAPPIE THOUGH THOU ART HAPPIER THOU MAYST BE WORTHIER CANST NOT BE
SUCH WHISPERING WAK'D HER BUT WITH STARTL'D EYE ON ADAM WHOM IMBRACING THUS SHE SPAKE O SOLE IN WHOM MY THOUGHTS FIND ALL REPOSE MY GLORIE MY PERFECTION GLAD I SEE THY FACE AND MORN RETURN'D FOR I THIS NIGHT

THY POWER ABOVE COMPARE AND THIS PERVERSE COMMOTION GOVERND THUS TO MANIFEST THEE WORTHIEST TO BE HEIR OF ALL THINGS TO BE HEIR AND TO BE KING BY SACRED UNCTION THY DESERVED RIGHT
AND FROM ABOUT HIM FIERCE EFFUSION ROWLD OF SMOAK AND BICKERING FLAME AND SPARKLES DIRE ATTENDED WITH TEN THOUSAND THOUSAND SAINTS HE ONWARD CAME FARR OFF HIS COMING SHON
AS THROUGH UNQUIET REST HE ON HIS SIDE LEANING HALF RAIS'D WITH LOOKS OF CORDIAL LOVE HUNG OVER HER ENAMOUR'D AND BEHELD BEAUTIE WHICH WHETHER WAKING OR ASLEEP SHOT FORTH PECULIAR GRACES
O'RE SHIELDS AND HELMES AND HELMED HEADS HE RODE OF THRONES AND MIGHTY SERAPHIM PROSTRATE THAT WISH'D THE MOUNTAINS NOW MIGHT BE AGAIN THROWN ON THEM AS A SHELTER FROM HIS IRE
BY VIOLENCE NO FOR THAT SHALL BE WITHSTOOD BUT BY DECEIT AND LIES THIS LET HIM KNOW LEAST WILFULLY TRANSGRESSING HE PRETEND SURPRISAL UNADMONISHT UNFOREWARND
MESSIAH HIS TRIUMPHAL CHARIOT TURND TO MEET HIM ALL HIS SAINTS WHO SILENT STOOD EYE WITNESSES OF HIS ALMIGHTIE ACTS WITH JUBILIE ADVANC'D AND AS THEY WENT SHADED WITH BRANCHING PALME
AND WOULD HAVE FLED AFFRIGHTED BUT STRICT FATE HAD CAST TOO DEEP HER DARK FOUNDATIONS AND TOO FAST HAD BOUND NINE DAYES THEY FELL CONFOUNDED CHAOS ROARD
WHICH OF US WHO BEHOLDS THE BRIGHT SURFACE OF THIS ETHEREOUS MOULD WHEREON WE STAND THIS CONTINENT OF SPACIOUS HEAV'N ADORND WITH PLANT FRUIT FLOUR AMBROSIAL GEMMS AND GOLD
AND NO SOLUTION WILL BE FOUND WARR WEARIED HATH PERFORM'D WHAT WARR CAN DO AND TO DISORDER'D RAGE LET LOOSE THE REINES WITH MOUNTAINS AS WITH WEAPONS ARM'D WHICH MAKES WILD WORK IN HEAV'N

TO RESPIT HIS DAY LABOUR WITH REPAST OR WITH REPOSE AND SUCH DISCOURSE BRING ON AS MAY ADVISE HIM OF HIS HAPPIE STATE HAPPINESS IN HIS POWER LEFT FREE TO WILL LEFT TO HIS OWN FREE WILL
IN HIS RIGHT HAND GRASPING TEN THOUSAND THUNDERS
FEARLESS IN HIS RIGHTEOUS CAUSE AND AS YE HAVE RECEIVD SO HAVE YE DON INVINCIBLY
AND ROUND SKIRTED HIS LOINES AND THIGHES WITH DOWNIE GOLD AND COLOURS DIPT IN HEAV'N THE THIRD HIS FEET SHADDOWD FROM EITHER HEELE WITH FEATHERD MAILE
AT HIS COMMAND THE UPROOTED HILLS RETIR'D EACH TO HIS PLACE THEY HEARD HIS VOICE AND WENT OBSEQUIOUS
WHICH GIVES ME HOPE THAT WHAT IN SLEEP THOU DIDST ABHORR TO DREAM WAKING THOU NEVER WILT CONSENT TO DO BE NOT DISHEART'ND THEN NOR CLOUD THOSE LOOKS THAT WONT TO BE MORE CHEARFUL AND SERENE
WHICH YET UNFOUND MOST WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE YET HAPLY OF THY RACE IN FUTURE DAYES IF MALICE SHOULD ABOUND SOME ONE INTENT ON MISCHIEF OR INSPIR'D WITH DEV'LISH MACHINATION MIGHT DEVISE LIKE INSTRUMENT
BUT GOE WITH SPEED AND WHAT THY STORES CONTAIN BRING FORTH AND POURE ABUNDANCE FIT TO HONOUR AND RECEIVE OUR HEAV'NLY STRANGER

DOWN THITHER PRONE IN FLIGHT HE SPEEDS
SULPHUROUS AND NITROUS FOAME THEY FOUND THEY MINGL'D AND WITH SUTTLE ART CONCOCTED AND ADUSTED THEY REDUC'D TO BLACKEST GRAIN AND INTO STORE CONVEYD PART HIDD'N VEINS DIGGD UP NOR HATH THIS EARTH ENTRAILS UNLIKE
WORTHIEST TO REIGN HE CELEBRATED RODE TRIUMPHANT THROUGH MID HEAV'N INTO THE COURTS AND TEMPLE OF HIS MIGHTIE FATHER THRON'D ON HIGH WHO INTO GLORIE HIM RECEAV'D WHERE NOW HE SITS AT THE RIGHT HAND OF BLISS
AND WITH THE INFANT AT HER BOSOM AN OBJECT TO REMIND HIM OF THE IMAGE OF DIVINE MATERNITY WHICH SO MANY ILLUSTRIOUS PAINTERS HAVE VIED WITH ONE ANOTHER TO REPRESENT SOMETHING WHICH SHOULD REMIND HIM INDEED BUT ONLY BY CONTRAST
IT DENOTED THE ADVANCE OF THE PROCESSION OF MAGISTRATES AND CITIZENS ON ITS WAY TOWARDS THE MEETING HOUSE WHERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH A CUSTOM THUS EARLY ESTABLISHED AND EVER SINCE OBSERVED
THAT LED BACKWARD TO THE SETTLEMENT WHERE HESTER PRYNNE MUST TAKE UP AGAIN THE BURDEN OF HER IGNOMINY AND THE MINISTER THE HOLLOW MOCKERY OF HIS GOOD NAME SO THEY LINGERED AN INSTANT LONGER
AND THOU ARTHUR DIMMESDALE DOST THOU YET LIVE IT WAS NO WONDER THAT THEY THUS QUESTIONED ONE ANOTHER'S ACTUAL AND BODILY EXISTENCE AND EVEN DOUBTED OF THEIR OWN SO STRANGELY DID THEY MEET IN THE DIM WOOD
TO SEE HER AS IF HER HEART HAD BEEN FLUNG INTO THE STREET FOR THEM ALL TO SPURN AND TRAMPLE UPON IN OUR NATURE HOWEVER THERE IS A PROVISION ALIKE MARVELLOUS AND MERCIFUL THAT THE SUFFERER SHOULD NEVER KNOW THE INTENSITY
THEY MIGHT LEARN THE SCIENCE AND SO FAR AS PEACEFUL EXERCISE WOULD TEACH THEM THE PRACTICES OF WAR THE HIGH ESTIMATION THEN PLACED UPON THE MILITARY CHARACTER MIGHT BE SEEN IN THE LOFTY PORT OF EACH INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE COMPANY
HESTER CRIED HE HERE IS A NEW HORROR ROGER CHILLINGWORTH KNOWS YOUR PURPOSE TO REVEAL HIS TRUE CHARACTER WILL HE CONTINUE THEN TO KEEP OUR SECRET WHAT WILL NOW BE THE COURSE OF HIS REVENGE
GREATLY FOR THE PUBLIC BEHOOF IF WE WOMEN BEING OF MATURE AGE AND CHURCH MEMBERS IN GOOD REPUTE SHOULD HAVE THE HANDLING OF SUCH MALEFACTRESSES AS THIS HESTER PRYNNE WHAT THINK YE GOSSIPS IF THE HUSSY STOOD UP FOR JUDGMENT BEFORE US FIVE
ON SOLID WISDOM AND SAD COLOURED EXPERIENCE ON ENDOWMENTS OF THAT GRAVE AND WEIGHTY ORDER WHICH GAVE THE IDEA OF PERMANENCE
THE MOTHER OF THIS CHILD STOOD FULLY REVEALED BEFORE THE CROWD IT SEEMED TO BE HER FIRST IMPULSE TO CLASP THE INFANT CLOSELY TO HER BOSOM
I DO FORGIVE YOU HESTER REPLIED THE MINISTER AT LENGTH WITH A DEEP UTTERANCE OUT OF AN ABYSS OF SADNESS BUT NO ANGER I FREELY FORGIVE YOU NOW
THERE IS NOT THE STRENGTH OR COURAGE LEFT ME TO VENTURE INTO THE WIDE STRANGE DIFFICULT WORLD ALONE IT WAS THE LAST EXPRESSION OF THE DESPONDENCY OF A BROKEN SPIRIT HE LACKED ENERGY
WITH WHOM TO WEEP OVER THY SIN THOU HAST IN ME
ON WHOM THE SENTENCE OF A LEGAL TRIBUNAL HAD BUT CONFIRMED THE VERDICT OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT BUT IN THAT EARLY SEVERITY OF THE PURITAN CHARACTER AN INFERENCE OF THIS KIND COULD NOT SO INDUBITABLY BE DRAWN
THAT OLD MAN'S REVENGE HAS BEEN BLACKER THAN MY SIN HE HAS VIOLATED IN COLD BLOOD THE SANCTITY OF A HUMAN HEART THOU AND I HESTER NEVER DID SO
ONE PICTURE PRECISELY AS VIVID AS ANOTHER AS IF ALL WERE OF SIMILAR IMPORTANCE OR ALL ALIKE A PLAY
WOULD THAT IT WERE TURNED TO SCORN AND HATRED CANST THOU DEEM IT HESTER A CONSOLATION THAT I MUST STAND UP IN MY PULPIT AND MEET SO MANY EYES TURNED UPWARD TO MY FACE
BEFORE SOCIETY SHALL HAVE GROWN CORRUPT ENOUGH TO SMILE INSTEAD OF SHUDDERING AT IT THE WITNESSES OF HESTER PRYNNE'S DISGRACE HAD NOT YET PASSED BEYOND THEIR SIMPLICITY THEY WERE STERN ENOUGH TO LOOK UPON HER DEATH HAD THAT BEEN THE SENTENCE WITHOUT A MURMUR AT ITS SEVERITY
AS IF THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN WERE BEAMING FROM IT MUST SEE MY FLOCK HUNGRY FOR THE TRUTH AND LISTENING TO MY WORDS AS IF A TONGUE OF PENTECOST WERE SPEAKING AND THEN LOOK INWARD
NOW MADE A GESTURE WITH HIS STAFF MAKE WAY GOOD PEOPLE MAKE WAY IN THE KING'S NAME CRIED HE OPEN A PASSAGE AND I PROMISE YE
A NEW LIFE BUT FEEDING ITSELF ON TIME WORN MATERIALS LIKE A TUFT OF GREEN MOSS ON A CRUMBLING WALL LASTLY IN LIEU OF THESE SHIFTING SCENES CAME BACK THE RUDE MARKET PLACE OF THE PURITAN SETTLEMENT WITH ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE ASSEMBLED
OTHER FACES THAN WERE LOWERING UPON HER FROM BENEATH THE BRIMS OF THOSE STEEPLE CROWNED HATS
A LANE WAS FORTHWITH OPENED THROUGH THE CROWD OF SPECTATORS PRECEDED BY THE BEADLE AND ATTENDED BY AN IRREGULAR PROCESSION OF STERN BROWED MEN AND UNKINDLY VISAGED WOMEN HESTER PRYNNE SET FORTH TOWARDS THE PLACE APPOINTED FOR HER PUNISHMENT
OR PERHAPS IN THE MISANTHROPY OF HER OWN TROUBLE SHE LEFT THE MINISTER TO BEAR WHAT SHE MIGHT PICTURE TO HERSELF AS A MORE TOLERABLE DOOM BUT OF LATE SINCE THE NIGHT OF HIS VIGIL
WAS WHAT HESTER COULD NOT BEAR AND LIVE WILT THOU YET FORGIVE ME SHE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WILT THOU NOT FROWN WILT THOU FORGIVE
AND SEEMED TO BE BORNE UPWARD LIKE A FLOATING SEA BIRD ON THE LONG HEAVES AND SWELLS OF SOUND BUT SHE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO HER FORMER MOOD BY THE SHIMMER OF THE SUNSHINE ON THE WEAPONS AND BRIGHT ARMOUR OF THE MILITARY COMPANY WHICH FOLLOWED AFTER THE MUSIC AND FORMED THE HONORARY ESCORT OF THE PROCESSION
WAS TO DIE UPON THE GALLOWS IN EITHER CASE THERE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME SOLEMNITY OF DEMEANOUR ON THE PART OF THE SPECTATORS AS BEFITTED A PEOPLE AMONG WHOM RELIGION AND LAW WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL
OF A MAN WELL STRICKEN IN YEARS A PALE THIN SCHOLAR LIKE VISAGE WITH EYES DIM AND BLEARED BY THE LAMP LIGHT THAT HAD SERVED THEM TO PORE OVER MANY PONDEROUS BOOKS
WHAT ELSE COULD I LOOK FOR BEING WHAT I AM AND LEADING SUCH A LIFE AS MINE
NOR WONTED TO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF DISEMBODIED BEINGS EACH A GHOST AND AWE STRICKEN AT THE OTHER GHOST THEY WERE AWE STRICKEN LIKEWISE AT THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE CRISIS FLUNG BACK TO THEM THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS
THERE CAN BE NO OUTRAGE METHINKS AGAINST OUR COMMON NATURE
HUSH HESTER SAID ARTHUR DIMMESDALE RISING FROM THE GROUND NO I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THEY SAT DOWN AGAIN SIDE BY SIDE
THERE IS GOOD TO BE DONE EXCHANGE THIS FALSE LIFE OF THINE FOR A TRUE ONE
BY AN ACTION MARKED WITH NATURAL DIGNITY AND FORCE OF CHARACTER AND STEPPED INTO THE OPEN AIR AS IF BY HER OWN FREE WILL SHE BORE IN HER ARMS A CHILD A BABY OF SOME THREE MONTHS OLD WHO WINKED AND TURNED ASIDE ITS LITTLE FACE FROM THE TOO VIVID LIGHT OF DAY
OF TWO SPIRITS WHO HAD BEEN INTIMATELY CONNECTED IN THEIR FORMER LIFE BUT NOW STOOD COLDLY SHUDDERING IN MUTUAL DREAD AS NOT YET FAMILIAR WITH THEIR STATE
IF THOU PREFER TO CROSS THE SEA LEAVE THIS WRECK AND RUIN HERE WHERE IT HATH HAPPENED
AS IT STOLE ALONG AND YET IT UNCLOSED A CHARM THAT MADE THEM LINGER UPON IT AND CLAIM ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND AFTER ALL ANOTHER MOMENT
SHRINKING WITHIN HIMSELF AND PRESSING HIS HAND NERVOUSLY AGAINST HIS HEART A GESTURE THAT HAD GROWN INVOLUNTARY WITH HIM THINK FOR ME HESTER THOU ART STRONG RESOLVE FOR ME
THEY HAVE KEPT THY BETTER PART IN BONDAGE TOO LONG ALREADY IT CANNOT BE ANSWERED THE MINISTER LISTENING AS IF HE WERE CALLED UPON TO REALISE A DREAM I AM POWERLESS TO GO WRETCHED AND SINFUL AS I AM
CLAD IN GARMENTS SO SOMBRE AND SO LITTLE RELIEVED FROM THE GRAY TWILIGHT
AT THE VERY LEAST THEY SHOULD HAVE PUT THE BRAND OF A HOT IRON ON HESTER PRYNNE'S FOREHEAD MADAME HESTER WOULD HAVE WINCED AT THAT I WARRANT ME BUT SHE THE NAUGHTY BAGGAGE LITTLE WILL SHE CARE WHAT THEY PUT UPON THE BODICE OF HER GOWN WHY LOOK YOU
TRUTH WAS THE ONE VIRTUE WHICH I MIGHT HAVE HELD FAST AND DID HOLD FAST THROUGH ALL EXTREMITY SAVE WHEN THY GOOD THY LIFE THY FAME WERE PUT IN QUESTION THEN I CONSENTED
WHICH INDEED SHE HAD WROUGHT FOR THE OCCASION IN PRISON
WHERE PROVIDENCE HATH PLACED ME LOST AS MY OWN SOUL IS I WOULD STILL DO WHAT I MAY FOR OTHER HUMAN SOULS I DARE NOT QUIT MY POST THOUGH AN UNFAITHFUL SENTINEL
AND SEVERAL OF HIS COUNSELLORS A JUDGE A GENERAL AND THE MINISTERS OF THE TOWN ALL OF WHOM SAT OR STOOD IN A BALCONY OF THE MEETING HOUSE LOOKING DOWN UPON THE PLATFORM
HESTER I AM MOST MISERABLE THE PEOPLE REVERENCE THEE SAID HESTER AND SURELY THOU WORKEST GOOD AMONG THEM DOTH THIS BRING THEE NO COMFORT
WHITHER LEADS YONDER FOREST TRACK BACKWARD TO THE SETTLEMENT THOU SAYEST YES BUT ONWARD TOO DEEPER IT GOES AND DEEPER INTO THE WILDERNESS
IT WAS A DARK TRANSFIGURATION BUT HIS CHARACTER HAD BEEN SO MUCH ENFEEBLED BY SUFFERING THAT EVEN ITS LOWER ENERGIES WERE INCAPABLE
WHEN OUR STORY BEGINS ITS COURSE THAT THE WOMEN OF WHOM THERE WERE SEVERAL IN THE CROWD APPEARED TO TAKE A PECULIAR INTEREST IN WHATEVER PENAL INFLICTION MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO ENSUE
NEVER NEVER WHISPERED SHE WHAT WE DID HAD A CONSECRATION OF ITS OWN WE FELT IT SO WE SAID SO TO EACH OTHER HAST THOU FORGOTTEN IT
AND IN WHOSE CHARACTER BOTH WERE SO THOROUGHLY INTERFUSED THAT THE MILDEST AND SEVEREST ACTS OF PUBLIC DISCIPLINE WERE ALIKE MADE VENERABLE AND AWFUL MEAGRE INDEED AND COLD WAS THE SYMPATHY THAT A TRANSGRESSOR MIGHT LOOK FOR FROM SUCH BYSTANDERS AT THE SCAFFOLD
IN PERMITTING HIM TO LIE FOR SO MANY YEARS OR INDEED FOR A SINGLE MOMENT AT THE MERCY OF ONE WHOSE PURPOSES COULD NOT BE OTHER THAN MALEVOLENT THE VERY CONTIGUITY OF HIS ENEMY
A BOLDNESS AND ROTUNDITY OF SPEECH AMONG THESE MATRONS AS MOST OF THEM SEEMED TO BE THAT WOULD STARTLE US AT THE PRESENT DAY
THUS THEY WENT ONWARD NOT BOLDLY BUT STEP BY STEP INTO THE THEMES THAT WERE BROODING DEEPEST IN THEIR HEARTS SO LONG ESTRANGED BY FATE AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEY NEEDED
IN TOKEN OF ANTIQUE GENTILITY
A CROWD OF EAGER AND CURIOUS SCHOOLBOYS UNDERSTANDING LITTLE OF THE MATTER IN HAND EXCEPT THAT IT GAVE THEM A HALF HOLIDAY RAN BEFORE HER PROGRESS
WHEN THEY FOUND VOICE TO SPEAK IT WAS AT FIRST ONLY TO UTTER REMARKS AND INQUIRIES SUCH AS ANY TWO ACQUAINTANCES MIGHT HAVE MADE ABOUT THE GLOOMY SKY THE THREATENING STORM AND NEXT
THANK THEMSELVES IF THEIR OWN WIVES AND DAUGHTERS GO ASTRAY
OF WHAT HE ENDURES BY ITS PRESENT TORTURE BUT CHIEFLY BY THE PANG THAT RANKLES AFTER IT
AND WHICH EVEN SINCE HER DEATH HAD SO OFTEN LAID THE IMPEDIMENT OF A GENTLE REMONSTRANCE IN HER DAUGHTER'S PATHWAY SHE SAW HER OWN FACE GLOWING WITH GIRLISH BEAUTY AND ILLUMINATING ALL THE INTERIOR OF THE DUSKY MIRROR IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN
BUT HAD NONE OF THE HEARTLESSNESS OF ANOTHER SOCIAL STATE WHICH WOULD FIND ONLY A THEME FOR JEST IN AN EXHIBITION LIKE THE PRESENT EVEN HAD THERE BEEN A DISPOSITION TO TURN THE MATTER INTO RIDICULE IT MUST HAVE BEEN REPRESSED AND OVERPOWERED BY THE SOLEMN PRESENCE OF MEN NO LESS DIGNIFIED THAN THE GOVERNOR
YOUR PRESENT LIFE IS NOT LESS HOLY IN VERY TRUTH THAN IT SEEMS IN PEOPLE'S EYES IS THERE NO REALITY IN THE PENITENCE THUS SEALED AND WITNESSED BY GOOD WORKS AND WHEREFORE SHOULD IT NOT BRING YOU PEACE
WHILE THE PROCESSION PASSED
AND GORGEOUS LUXURIANCE OF FANCY THAT IT HAD ALL THE EFFECT OF A LAST AND FITTING DECORATION TO THE APPAREL WHICH SHE WORE
SEEM TO HAVE BEEN NOT OFTEN BRILLIANT BUT DISTINGUISHED BY A PONDEROUS SOBRIETY RATHER THAN ACTIVITY OF INTELLECT THEY HAD FORTITUDE AND SELF RELIANCE
BECAUSE ITS EXISTENCE HERETOFORE HAD BROUGHT IT
THE INTRICATE AND NARROW THOROUGHFARES THE TALL GREY HOUSES
THE UNHAPPY CULPRIT SUSTAINED HERSELF AS BEST A WOMAN MIGHT UNDER THE HEAVY WEIGHT OF A THOUSAND UNRELENTING EYES ALL FASTENED UPON HER
WHO CAME IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE MILITARY ESCORT WERE BETTER WORTH A THOUGHTFUL OBSERVER'S EYE EVEN IN OUTWARD DEMEANOUR THEY SHOWED A STAMP OF MAJESTY THAT MADE THE WARRIOR'S HAUGHTY STRIDE LOOK VULGAR IF NOT ABSURD
WRITE ACT DO ANYTHING SAVE TO LIE DOWN AND DIE GIVE UP THIS NAME OF ARTHUR DIMMESDALE
AND BREEDING THAN IN THEIR FAIR DESCENDANTS SEPARATED FROM THEM BY A SERIES OF SIX OR SEVEN GENERATIONS FOR THROUGHOUT THAT CHAIN OF ANCESTRY EVERY SUCCESSIVE MOTHER HAD TRANSMITTED TO HER CHILD A FAINTER BLOOM A MORE DELICATE AND BRIEFER BEAUTY
REVEREND WHITE BEARD THAT FLOWED OVER THE OLD FASHIONED ELIZABETHAN RUFF HER MOTHER'S TOO WITH THE LOOK OF HEEDFUL AND ANXIOUS LOVE
CLAD IN BURNISHED STEEL AND WITH PLUMAGE NODDING OVER THEIR BRIGHT MORIONS HAD A BRILLIANCY OF EFFECT WHICH NO MODERN DISPLAY CAN ASPIRE TO EQUAL AND YET THE MEN OF CIVIL EMINENCE
AND A SLIGHTER PHYSICAL FRAME IF NOT CHARACTER OF LESS FORCE AND SOLIDITY THAN HER OWN THE WOMEN WHO WERE NOW STANDING ABOUT THE PRISON DOOR STOOD WITHIN LESS THAN HALF A CENTURY OF THE PERIOD WHEN THE MAN LIKE ELIZABETH
MORE MISERY HESTER ONLY THE MORE MISERY ANSWERED THE CLERGYMAN WITH A BITTER SMILE AS CONCERNS THE GOOD WHICH I MAY APPEAR TO DO I HAVE NO FAITH IN IT IT MUST NEEDS BE A DELUSION
AT ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF A MAN'S SHOULDERS ABOVE THE STREET
BE A SCHOLAR AND A SAGE AMONG THE WISEST AND THE MOST RENOWNED OF THE CULTIVATED WORLD
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT BE THOU STRONG FOR ME ANSWERED HE ADVISE ME WHAT TO DO IS THE WORLD THEN SO NARROW EXCLAIMED HESTER PRYNNE
LONG CONTINUED THOUGHT OR PERCHANCE HIS SENSITIVE TEMPERAMENT WAS INVIGORATED BY THE LOUD AND PIERCING MUSIC THAT SWELLED HEAVEN WARD AND UPLIFTED HIM ON ITS ASCENDING WAVE NEVERTHELESS
FLASHED UP AND DIED AWAY THOU TELLEST OF RUNNING A RACE TO A MAN WHOSE KNEES ARE TOTTERING BENEATH HIM I MUST DIE HERE
HAD THE IMPRESSIVENESS BELONGING TO A MARKED BROW AND DEEP BLACK EYES SHE WAS LADYLIKE TOO AFTER THE MANNER OF THE FEMININE GENTILITY OF THOSE DAYS CHARACTERISED BY A CERTAIN STATE AND DIGNITY
WHERE I CAST MYSELF WHEN THOU DIDST TELL ME WHAT HE WAS
TO GRASP THE BETTER FORTUNE THAT SEEMED WITHIN HIS REACH HE REPEATED THE WORD ALONE HESTER
HEAVEN LIKEWISE HAD FROWNED UPON HER AND SHE HAD NOT DIED BUT THE FROWN OF THIS PALE WEAK SINFUL AND SORROW STRICKEN MAN
WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE SQUARE CAST OF COUNTENANCE AND LARGE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW COLONIAL MAGISTRATES SO FAR AS A DEMEANOUR OF NATURAL AUTHORITY WAS CONCERNED THE MOTHER COUNTRY NEED NOT HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO SEE
BUT GREATLY BEYOND WHAT WAS ALLOWED BY THE SUMPTUARY
BY HERSELF SHE HATH GOOD SKILL AT HER NEEDLE THAT'S CERTAIN REMARKED ONE OF HER FEMALE SPECTATORS
THAT WILL LEAVE THEE POWERLESS EVEN TO REPENT UP AND AWAY OH HESTER CRIED ARTHUR DIMMESDALE IN WHOSE EYES A FITFUL LIGHT KINDLED BY HER ENTHUSIASM
HAD A ROAR OF LAUGHTER BURST FROM THE MULTITUDE EACH MAN EACH WOMAN EACH LITTLE SHRILL VOICED CHILD CONTRIBUTING THEIR INDIVIDUAL PARTS
DOST THOU NOT SEE WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT OLD MAN THE PHYSICIAN HE WHOM THEY CALL ROGER CHILLINGWORTH HE WAS MY HUSBAND
WITH SUDDEN AND DESPERATE TENDERNESS SHE THREW HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PRESSED HIS HEAD AGAINST HER BOSOM LITTLE CARING THOUGH HIS CHEEK RESTED ON THE SCARLET LETTER
WOULD SHE COME OFF WITH SUCH A SENTENCE AS THE WORSHIPFUL MAGISTRATES HAVE AWARDED MARRY I TROW NOT PEOPLE SAY SAID ANOTHER THAT THE REVEREND MASTER DIMMESDALE HER GODLY PASTOR TAKES IT VERY GRIEVOUSLY TO HEART THAT SUCH A SCANDAL SHOULD HAVE COME UPON HIS CONGREGATION
IF OCCASION WERE INTO THE THRONG NEAREST TO THE SCAFFOLD AT AN EXECUTION
AS THAT SHE MIGHT THEREBY CONCEAL A CERTAIN TOKEN WHICH WAS WROUGHT OR FASTENED INTO HER DRESS
WHILE STILL THE FACULTY AND NECESSITY OF REVERENCE WAS STRONG IN HIM BESTOWED IT ON THE WHITE HAIR AND VENERABLE BROW OF AGE ON LONG TRIED INTEGRITY
BUT UNDER THE LEADEN INFLICTION WHICH IT WAS HER DOOM TO ENDURE SHE FELT AT MOMENTS AS IF SHE MUST NEEDS SHRIEK OUT WITH THE FULL POWER OF HER LUNGS AND CAST HERSELF FROM THE SCAFFOLD DOWN UPON THE GROUND OR ELSE GO MAD AT ONCE
SO ABSTRACTED WAS HIS LOOK IT MIGHT BE QUESTIONED WHETHER MISTER DIMMESDALE EVEN HEARD THE MUSIC THERE WAS HIS BODY MOVING ONWARD AND WITH AN UNACCUSTOMED FORCE BUT WHERE WAS HIS MIND
THIS BODY OF SOLDIERY WHICH STILL SUSTAINS A CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND MARCHES DOWN FROM PAST AGES WITH AN ANCIENT AND HONOURABLE FAME WAS COMPOSED OF NO MERCENARY MATERIALS
GRASP AND THUS HOLD IT UP TO THE PUBLIC GAZE THE VERY IDEAL OF IGNOMINY
FOR TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS PAST HAS BEEN MERELY HISTORICAL AND TRADITIONARY AMONG US BUT WAS HELD IN THE OLD TIME
THE GRIM RIGIDITY THAT PETRIFIED THE BEARDED PHYSIOGNOMIES OF THESE GOOD PEOPLE
WERE ASTONISHED AND EVEN STARTLED TO PERCEIVE HOW HER BEAUTY SHONE OUT AND MADE A HALO OF THE MISFORTUNE AND IGNOMINY IN WHICH SHE WAS ENVELOPED IT MAY BE TRUE THAT TO A SENSITIVE OBSERVER THERE WAS SOME THING EXQUISITELY PAINFUL IN IT HER ATTIRE
AND CAME TO A SORT OF SCAFFOLD AT THE WESTERN EXTREMITY OF THE MARKET PLACE IT STOOD NEARLY BENEATH THE EAVES OF BOSTON'S EARLIEST CHURCH AND APPEARED TO BE A FIXTURE THERE IN FACT THIS SCAFFOLD CONSTITUTED A PORTION OF A PENAL MACHINE WHICH NOW
THE UGLIEST AS WELL AS THE MOST PITILESS
ANCIENT IN DATE AND QUAINT IN ARCHITECTURE OF A CONTINENTAL CITY WHERE NEW LIFE HAD AWAITED HER STILL IN
THERE COULD BE NO REAL BOND BETWIXT THE CLERGYMAN AND HERSELF AND THUS MUCH OF WOMAN WAS THERE IN HESTER THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY FORGIVE HIM LEAST OF ALL NOW
PASSAGES OF INFANCY AND SCHOOL DAYS SPORTS CHILDISH QUARRELS AND THE LITTLE DOMESTIC TRAITS OF HER MAIDEN YEARS CAME SWARMING BACK UPON HER INTERMINGLED WITH RECOLLECTIONS OF WHATEVER WAS GRAVEST IN HER SUBSEQUENT LIFE
SOMETHING SLIGHT AND CASUAL TO RUN BEFORE AND THROW OPEN THE DOORS OF INTERCOURSE SO THAT THEIR REAL THOUGHTS MIGHT BE LED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD
BUT AS MATTERS STAND WITH MY SOUL WHATEVER OF GOOD CAPACITY THERE ORIGINALLY WAS IN ME ALL OF GOD'S GIFTS THAT WERE THE CHOICEST HAVE BECOME THE MINISTERS OF SPIRITUAL TORMENT
NEXT IN ORDER TO THE MAGISTRATES CAME THE YOUNG AND EMINENTLY DISTINGUISHED DIVINE FROM WHOSE LIPS THE RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE OF THE ANNIVERSARY WAS EXPECTED
FAR AND DEEP IN ITS OWN REGION BUSYING ITSELF WITH PRETERNATURAL ACTIVITY TO MARSHAL A PROCESSION OF STATELY THOUGHTS THAT WERE SOON TO ISSUE THENCE AND SO HE SAW NOTHING
BENEATH WHATEVER MASK THE LATTER MIGHT CONCEAL HIMSELF WAS ENOUGH TO DISTURB THE MAGNETIC SPHERE OF A BEING SO SENSITIVE AS ARTHUR DIMMESDALE THERE HAD BEEN A PERIOD WHEN HESTER WAS LESS ALIVE TO THIS CONSIDERATION
AND IS PARTLY PERHAPS FOR BOTH IN THAT OLD DAY THE ENGLISH SETTLER ON THESE RUDE SHORES HAVING LEFT KING NOBLES AND ALL DEGREES OF AWFUL RANK BEHIND
MAY GOD FORGIVE US BOTH WE ARE NOT HESTER THE WORST SINNERS IN THE WORLD THERE IS ONE WORSE THAN EVEN THE POLLUTED PRIEST
FIXING HER DEEP EYES ON THE MINISTER'S AND INSTINCTIVELY EXERCISING A MAGNETIC POWER OVER A SPIRIT SO SHATTERED AND SUBDUED THAT IT COULD HARDLY HOLD ITSELF ERECT
THIS FIGURE OF THE STUDY AND THE CLOISTER
FROM STEPPING FORTH INTO THE PUBLIC WAYS AND WEDGING THEIR
IT WAS THE OBSERVATION OF THOSE WHO BEHELD HIM NOW THAT NEVER SINCE MISTER DIMMESDALE FIRST SET HIS FOOT ON THE NEW ENGLAND SHORE HAD HE EXHIBITED SUCH ENERGY
TO A DECEPTION BUT A LIE IS NEVER GOOD
HERE SEEN ONLY BY HER EYES ARTHUR DIMMESDALE FALSE TO GOD AND MAN MIGHT BE FOR ONE MOMENT TRUE HE STARTED AT A THOUGHT THAT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM
SELF CONSTITUTED JUDGES THIS WOMAN HAS BROUGHT SHAME UPON US ALL AND OUGHT TO DIE IS THERE NOT LAW FOR IT TRULY THERE IS BOTH IN THE SCRIPTURE AND THE STATUTE BOOK THEN LET THE MAGISTRATES WHO HAVE MADE IT OF NO EFFECT
TO HIDE THY HEART FROM THE GAZE OF ROGER CHILLINGWORTH YES HESTER BUT ONLY UNDER THE FALLEN LEAVES REPLIED THE MINISTER WITH A SAD SMILE
LIKE A MAN TAKEN BY SURPRISE IN A MOOD TO WHICH HE WAS RELUCTANT TO HAVE WITNESSES THROWING HIS EYES ANXIOUSLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOICE HE INDISTINCTLY BEHELD A FORM UNDER THE TREES
BUT YET ATTAINING THE GREAT OBJECT FOR WHICH THE HARMONY OF DRUM AND CLARION ADDRESSES ITSELF TO THE MULTITUDE
ITS RANKS WERE FILLED WITH GENTLEMEN WHO FELT THE STIRRINGS OF MARTIAL IMPULSE AND SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A KIND OF COLLEGE OF ARMS WHERE AS IN AN ASSOCIATION OF KNIGHTS TEMPLARS
WAS THAT SCARLET LETTER SO FANTASTICALLY EMBROIDERED AND ILLUMINATED UPON HER BOSOM IT HAD THE EFFECT OF A SPELL TAKING HER OUT OF THE ORDINARY RELATIONS WITH HUMANITY
AND INVIGORATED SHE NOW READ HIS HEART MORE ACCURATELY SHE DOUBTED NOT THAT THE CONTINUAL PRESENCE OF ROGER CHILLINGWORTH THE SECRET POISON OF HIS MALIGNITY
SHE TURNED HER EYES DOWNWARD AT THE SCARLET LETTER AND EVEN TOUCHED IT WITH HER FINGER TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE INFANT AND THE SHAME WERE REAL YES THESE WERE HER REALITIES
WHETHER IN SOME REMOTE RURAL VILLAGE
COULD CONSTITUTE A PART OF THE SPECTACLE WITHOUT RISKING THE MAJESTY OR REVERENCE OF RANK AND OFFICE IT WAS SAFELY TO BE INFERRED THAT THE INFLICTION OF A LEGAL SENTENCE WOULD HAVE AN EARNEST AND EFFECTUAL MEANING ACCORDINGLY THE CROWD WAS SOMBRE AND GRAVE
THE MINISTER STARTED TO HIS FEET GASPING FOR BREATH AND CLUTCHING AT HIS HEART AS IF HE WOULD HAVE TORN IT OUT OF HIS BOSOM HA
THESE FOREMOST MEN OF AN ACTUAL DEMOCRACY ADOPTED INTO THE HOUSE OF PEERS OR MAKE THE PRIVY COUNCIL OF THE SOVEREIGN
BUT THOU SHALT LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND THEE
POSSESS THIS OCCASIONAL POWER OF MIGHTY EFFORT INTO WHICH THEY THROW THE LIFE OF MANY DAYS AND THEN ARE LIFELESS FOR AS MANY MORE HESTER PRYNNE GAZING STEADFASTLY AT THE CLERGYMAN FELT
AND DISCERN THE BLACK REALITY OF WHAT THEY IDOLISE I HAVE LAUGHED IN BITTERNESS AND AGONY OF HEART AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN WHAT I SEEM
OF THAT SACRED IMAGE OF SINLESS MOTHERHOOD WHOSE INFANT WAS TO REDEEM THE WORLD HERE THERE WAS THE TAINT OF DEEPEST SIN IN THE MOST SACRED QUALITY OF HUMAN LIFE WORKING SUCH EFFECT THAT THE WORLD WAS ONLY THE DARKER FOR THIS WOMAN'S BEAUTY
WAS SLIGHTLY DEFORMED WITH THE LEFT SHOULDER A TRIFLE HIGHER THAN THE RIGHT NEXT ROSE BEFORE HER
MEASURED BY THE PRISONER'S EXPERIENCE HOWEVER
OR OTHER DARKSOME APARTMENT OF THE PRISON
OF PENITENCE THERE HAS BEEN NONE ELSE I SHOULD LONG AGO HAVE THROWN OFF THESE GARMENTS OF MOCK HOLINESS AND HAVE SHOWN MYSELF TO MANKIND AS THEY WILL SEE ME AT THE JUDGMENT SEAT HAPPY ARE YOU HESTER
OR ITS VOLUME OF TONE GOODWIVES SAID A HARD FEATURED DAME OF FIFTY
IT IS ALL FALSEHOOD
METHINKS MY SOUL MIGHT KEEP ITSELF ALIVE THEREBY
INFECTING ALL THE AIR ABOUT HIM AND HIS AUTHORISED INTERFERENCE AS A PHYSICIAN WITH THE MINISTER'S PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL INFIRMITIES THAT THESE BAD OPPORTUNITIES HAD BEEN TURNED TO A CRUEL PURPOSE
HEARD NOTHING KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS AROUND HIM BUT THE SPIRITUAL ELEMENT TOOK UP THE FEEBLE FRAME AND CARRIED IT ALONG UNCONSCIOUS OF THE BURDEN AND CONVERTING IT TO SPIRIT LIKE ITSELF
PHANTASMAGORIC FORMS FROM THE CRUEL WEIGHT AND HARDNESS OF THE REALITY BE THAT AS IT MIGHT THE SCAFFOLD OF THE PILLORY
THE TEACHER AND APOSTLE OF THE RED MEN
SO BRIEF A JOURNEY WOULD BRING THEE FROM A WORLD WHERE THOU HAST BEEN MOST WRETCHED TO ONE WHERE THOU MAYEST STILL BE HAPPY IS THERE NOT SHADE ENOUGH IN ALL THIS BOUNDLESS FOREST
AND LEVELLING THEIR STERN REGARDS AT HESTER PRYNNE YES AT HERSELF WHO STOOD ON THE SCAFFOLD OF THE PILLORY AN INFANT ON HER ARM AND THE LETTER A IN SCARLET FANTASTICALLY EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD THREAD UPON HER BOSOM
ONE GLANCE OF RECOGNITION SHE HAD IMAGINED MUST NEEDS PASS BETWEEN THEM SHE
THE MINISTER LOOKED AT HER FOR AN INSTANT WITH ALL THAT VIOLENCE OF PASSION WHICH INTERMIXED IN MORE SHAPES THAN ONE WITH HIS HIGHER PURER SOFTER QUALITIES WAS IN FACT
NOT ALTOGETHER UNSUITABLE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SEX THEY WERE HER COUNTRYWOMEN AND THE BEEF AND ALE OF THEIR NATIVE LAND WITH A MORAL DIET NOT A WHIT MORE REFINED ENTERED LARGELY INTO THEIR COMPOSITION THE BRIGHT MORNING SUN THEREFORE
YET THERE WERE INTERVALS WHEN THE WHOLE SCENE IN WHICH SHE WAS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OBJECT SEEMED TO VANISH FROM HER EYES OR AT LEAST GLIMMERED INDISTINCTLY BEFORE THEM LIKE A MASS OF IMPERFECTLY SHAPED AND SPECTRAL IMAGES
SOME OF THEM INDEED BY THEIR SERVICES IN THE LOW COUNTRIES AND ON OTHER FIELDS OF EUROPEAN WARFARE HAD FAIRLY WON THEIR TITLE TO ASSUME THE NAME AND POMP OF SOLDIERSHIP THE ENTIRE ARRAY MOREOVER
NOT OF THE BODY IT MIGHT BE SPIRITUAL AND IMPARTED TO HIM BY ANGELICAL MINISTRATIONS IT MIGHT BE THE EXHILARATION OF THAT POTENT CORDIAL WHICH IS DISTILLED ONLY IN THE FURNACE GLOW OF EARNEST AND
THEN THERE IS THE BROAD PATHWAY OF THE SEA CONTINUED HESTER IT BROUGHT THEE HITHER IF THOU SO CHOOSE IT WILL BEAR THEE BACK AGAIN IN OUR NATIVE LAND
IN FRANCE IN PLEASANT ITALY
FAINTLY AT FIRST THEN LOUDER BUT HOARSELY ARTHUR DIMMESDALE WHO SPEAKS ANSWERED THE MINISTER GATHERING HIMSELF QUICKLY UP
AS SHE HAD ALREADY TOLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WOULD HAVE BEEN INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN UPON HERSELF TO CHOOSE AND NOW RATHER THAN HAVE HAD THIS GRIEVOUS WRONG TO CONFESS
THAT WEAR THE SCARLET LETTER OPENLY UPON YOUR BOSOM MINE BURNS IN SECRET THOU LITTLE KNOWEST WHAT A RELIEF IT IS AFTER THE TORMENT OF A SEVEN YEARS CHEAT
HIS WAS THE PROFESSION AT THAT ERA IN WHICH INTELLECTUAL ABILITY DISPLAYED ITSELF FAR MORE THAN IN POLITICAL LIFE FOR LEAVING A HIGHER MOTIVE OUT OF THE QUESTION IT OFFERED
OUT OF WHAT THEY WORTHY GENTLEMEN MEANT FOR A PUNISHMENT IT WERE WELL MUTTERED THE MOST IRON VISAGED OF THE OLD DAMES IF WE STRIPPED MADAME HESTER'S RICH GOWN OFF HER DAINTY SHOULDERS
THERE WAS NO FEEBLENESS OF STEP AS AT OTHER TIMES HIS FRAME WAS NOT BENT NOR DID HIS HAND REST OMINOUSLY UPON HIS HEART YET IF THE CLERGYMAN WERE RIGHTLY VIEWED HIS STRENGTH SEEMED
INDESCRIBABLE GRACE WHICH IS NOW RECOGNISED AS ITS INDICATION AND NEVER HAD HESTER PRYNNE APPEARED MORE LADYLIKE IN THE ANTIQUE INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM THAN AS SHE ISSUED FROM THE PRISON
BEGIN ALL ANEW HAST THOU EXHAUSTED POSSIBILITY IN THE FAILURE OF THIS ONE TRIAL NOT SO THE FUTURE IS YET FULL OF TRIAL AND SUCCESS THERE IS HAPPINESS TO BE ENJOYED
MADNESS IS PERHAPS THE EARTHLY TYPE SUCH WAS THE RUIN TO WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT THE MAN ONCE NAY WHY SHOULD WE NOT SPEAK IT STILL SO PASSIONATELY LOVED
THOU MUST DWELL NO LONGER WITH THIS MAN SAID HESTER SLOWLY AND FIRMLY THY HEART
AND HAND CLASPED IN HAND ON THE MOSSY TRUNK OF THE FALLEN TREE LIFE HAD NEVER BROUGHT THEM A GLOOMIER HOUR IT WAS THE POINT WHITHER THEIR PATHWAY HAD SO LONG BEEN TENDING AND DARKENING EVER
BY MEANS OF THEM THE SUFFERER'S CONSCIENCE HAD BEEN KEPT IN AN IRRITATED STATE THE TENDENCY OF WHICH WAS NOT TO CURE BY WHOLESOME PAIN
ACQUAINTED WITH HESTER PRYNNE WERE NOW IMPRESSED
AND THE MORE LOST FOR THE INFANT THAT SHE HAD BORNE THE SCENE WAS NOT WITHOUT A MIXTURE OF AWE SUCH AS MUST ALWAYS INVEST THE SPECTACLE OF GUILT AND SHAME IN A FELLOW CREATURE
BUT BROUGHT OUT THE WORDS WITH AN EFFORT THOU HAST LONG HAD SUCH AN ENEMY AND DWELLEST WITH HIM UNDER THE SAME ROOF
IT MIGHT BE THAT A SLUGGISH BOND SERVANT OR AN UNDUTIFUL CHILD WHOM HIS PARENTS HAD GIVEN OVER TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITY WAS TO BE CORRECTED AT THE WHIPPING POST IT MIGHT BE THAT AN ANTINOMIAN A QUAKER OR OTHER HETERODOX RELIGIONIST WAS TO BE SCOURGED OUT OF THE TOWN
WAS PRETERNATURALLY ACTIVE AND KEPT BRINGING UP OTHER SCENES THAN THIS ROUGHLY HEWN STREET OF A LITTLE
HAD FAR LESS CONSIDERATION THAN NOW BUT THE MASSIVE MATERIALS WHICH PRODUCE STABILITY AND DIGNITY OF CHARACTER A GREAT DEAL MORE THE PEOPLE POSSESSED BY HEREDITARY RIGHT THE QUALITY OF REVERENCE
A DREARY INFLUENCE COME OVER HER BUT WHEREFORE OR WHENCE SHE KNEW NOT UNLESS THAT HE SEEMED SO REMOTE FROM HER OWN SPHERE
YET THOSE SAME BLEARED OPTICS HAD A STRANGE PENETRATING POWER
SHE SHOULD STAND A CERTAIN TIME UPON THE PLATFORM BUT WITHOUT UNDERGOING THAT GRIPE ABOUT THE NECK AND CONFINEMENT OF THE HEAD THE PRONENESS TO WHICH WAS THE MOST DEVILISH CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS UGLY ENGINE
BUT THERE WAS A QUALITY SO MUCH MORE TERRIBLE IN THE SOLEMN MOOD OF THE POPULAR MIND THAT SHE LONGED RATHER TO BEHOLD ALL THOSE RIGID COUNTENANCES CONTORTED WITH SCORNFUL MERRIMENT AND HERSELF THE OBJECT
COULD IT BE TRUE SHE CLUTCHED THE CHILD SO FIERCELY TO HER BREAST THAT IT SENT
FROM THIS TIME TILL AN HOUR PAST MERIDIAN A BLESSING ON THE RIGHTEOUS COLONY OF THE MASSACHUSETTS WHERE INIQUITY IS DRAGGED OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE COME ALONG MADAME HESTER AND SHOW YOUR SCARLET LETTER IN THE MARKET PLACE
FOR BEING ABLE SO COMPLETELY TO WITHDRAW HIMSELF FROM THEIR MUTUAL WORLD
IS THERE NO VIRTUE IN WOMAN SAVE WHAT SPRINGS FROM A WHOLESOME FEAR OF THE GALLOWS THAT IS THE HARDEST WORD YET HUSH NOW GOSSIPS FOR THE LOCK IS TURNING IN THE PRISON DOOR AND HERE COMES MISTRESS PRYNNE HERSELF
OF THE SAME SPHERE WITHOUT A WORD MORE SPOKEN NEITHER HE NOR SHE ASSUMING THE GUIDANCE BUT WITH AN UNEXPRESSED CONSENT THEY GLIDED BACK INTO THE SHADOW OF THE WOODS WHENCE HESTER HAD EMERGED
THE DOOR OF THE JAIL BEING FLUNG OPEN FROM WITHIN THERE APPEARED IN THE FIRST PLACE LIKE A BLACK SHADOW EMERGING INTO SUNSHINE THE GRIM AND GRISTLY PRESENCE OF THE TOWN BEADLE WITH A SWORD BY HIS SIDE AND HIS STAFF OF OFFICE IN HIS HAND THIS PERSONAGE
THE FOREST WAS OBSCURE AROUND THEM AND CREAKED WITH A BLAST THAT WAS PASSING THROUGH IT THE BOUGHS WERE TOSSING HEAVILY ABOVE THEIR HEADS WHILE ONE SOLEMN OLD TREE GROANED DOLEFULLY TO ANOTHER
WOMAN THOU ART ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS I CANNOT FORGIVE THEE
THAT OF IMPARTING A HIGHER AND MORE HEROIC AIR TO THE SCENE OF LIFE THAT PASSES BEFORE THE EYE LITTLE PEARL AT FIRST CLAPPED HER HANDS BUT THEN LOST FOR AN INSTANT THE RESTLESS AGITATION THAT HAD KEPT HER IN A CONTINUAL EFFERVESCENCE THROUGHOUT THE MORNING SHE GAZED SILENTLY
AND REVEALED TO EACH HEART ITS HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE AS LIFE NEVER DOES EXCEPT AT SUCH BREATHLESS EPOCHS THE SOUL BEHELD ITS FEATURES IN THE MIRROR OF THE PASSING MOMENT
WOULD BUT POORLY SERVE TO HIDE ANOTHER SHE TOOK THE BABY ON HER ARM AND WITH A BURNING BLUSH AND YET A HAUGHTY SMILE AND A GLANCE THAT WOULD NOT BE ABASHED LOOKED AROUND AT HER TOWNSPEOPLE AND NEIGHBOURS ON THE BREAST OF HER GOWN
WITH THE TEARS GUSHING INTO HER EYES WILT THOU DIE FOR VERY WEAKNESS THERE IS NO OTHER CAUSE THE JUDGMENT OF GOD IS ON ME ANSWERED THE CONSCIENCE STRICKEN PRIEST
THERE IS A STRANGE SECRECY IN HIS NATURE REPLIED HESTER THOUGHTFULLY AND IT HAS GROWN UPON HIM BY THE HIDDEN PRACTICES OF HIS REVENGE I DEEM IT NOT LIKELY THAT HE WILL BETRAY THE SECRET
SHE HARDLY KNEW HIM NOW HE MOVING PROUDLY PAST ENVELOPED AS IT WERE IN THE RICH MUSIC WITH THE PROCESSION OF MAJESTIC AND VENERABLE FATHERS HE SO UNATTAINABLE IN HIS WORLDLY POSITION AND STILL MORE SO IN THAT FAR VISTA
AS IF TELLING THE SAD STORY OF THE PAIR THAT SAT BENEATH OR CONSTRAINED TO FORBODE EVIL TO COME AND YET THEY LINGERED HOW DREARY LOOKED THE FOREST TRACK
I TOOK CARE TO HAVE THE CART THERE AND THEN DROVE IT OFF DOWN THE ROAD AND LEAVING IT IN CHARGE OF MY WIFE AND SERVANT RUSHED INTO MY HOUSE AND PACKED A FEW VALUABLES SUCH PLATE AS WE HAD AND SO FORTH
THAT IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE THAT ANY GREAT PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION COULD HAVE BEEN SLAIN BUT THEN I NOTICED HOW YELLOW WERE THE SKINS OF THE PEOPLE I MET HOW SHAGGY THE HAIR OF THE MEN HOW LARGE AND BRIGHT THEIR EYES
THEY HAVE BECOME PRACTICALLY MERE BRAINS WEARING DIFFERENT BODIES ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS JUST AS MEN WEAR SUITS OF CLOTHES AND TAKE A BICYCLE IN A HURRY OR AN UMBRELLA IN THE WET AND OF THEIR APPLIANCES
THE SENTENCE ENDED ABRUPTLY I REMEMBERED MY INABILITY TO FIX MY MIND THAT MORNING SCARCELY A MONTH GONE BY AND HOW I HAD BROKEN OFF TO GET MY DAILY CHRONICLE FROM THE NEWSBOY I REMEMBERED HOW I WENT DOWN TO THE GARDEN GATE AS HE CAME ALONG
AND ITS CACTUS LIKE BRANCHES FORMED A CARMINE FRINGE TO THE EDGES OF OUR TRIANGULAR WINDOW AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND IT BROADCAST THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND ESPECIALLY WHEREVER THERE WAS A STREAM OF WATER THE MARTIANS HAD WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN AN AUDITORY ORGAN
WITHOUT ANY OF THE EMOTIONAL SUBSTRATUM OF THE HUMAN BEING THE LAST SALIENT POINT IN WHICH THE SYSTEMS OF THESE CREATURES DIFFERED FROM OURS
I SAW LITTLE OF THE MISCHIEF WROUGHT BY THE MARTIANS UNTIL I REACHED WELLINGTON STREET AND THERE I SAW THE RED WEED CLAMBERING OVER THE BUTTRESSES OF WATERLOO BRIDGE AT THE CORNER OF THE BRIDGE TOO I SAW ONE OF THE COMMON CONTRASTS OF THAT GROTESQUE TIME
THE RUN AND SMASH OF SLIPPING PLASTER AND THE TRIANGULAR APERTURE IN THE WALL WAS DARKENED I LOOKED UP AND SAW THE LOWER SURFACE OF A HANDLING MACHINE COMING SLOWLY ACROSS THE HOLE
SEEMED BLOOD RED AND THREW AN UNFAMILIAR LURID LIGHT UPON EVERYTHING STOP HERE SAID I YOU ARE SAFE HERE AND I STARTED OFF AT ONCE FOR THE SPOTTED DOG
THE BEECH TREES BELOW THE HOUSE WERE BURNING WHILE I DID THIS AND THE PALINGS UP THE ROAD GLOWED RED WHILE I WAS OCCUPIED IN THIS WAY ONE OF THE DISMOUNTED HUSSARS CAME RUNNING UP HE WAS GOING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE WARNING PEOPLE TO LEAVE
AND THEREFORE WITHOUT ANY OF THE TUMULTUOUS EMOTIONS THAT ARISE FROM THAT DIFFERENCE AMONG MEN A YOUNG MARTIAN THERE CAN NOW BE NO DISPUTE WAS REALLY BORN UPON EARTH DURING THE WAR AND IT WAS FOUND ATTACHED TO ITS PARENT PARTIALLY BUDDED OFF
THEY AREN'T TO BE KILLED SAID THE MILKMAN IF THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE AVOIDED
SQUEAMISH AS I MAY SEEM I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO DESCRIBE WHAT I COULD NOT ENDURE EVEN TO CONTINUE WATCHING LET IT SUFFICE TO SAY BLOOD OBTAINED FROM A STILL LIVING ANIMAL IN MOST CASES FROM A HUMAN BEING WAS RUN DIRECTLY BY MEANS OF A LITTLE PIPETTE
JUST AS YOUNG LILYBULBS BUD OFF OR LIKE THE YOUNG ANIMALS IN THE FRESH WATER POLYP IN MAN IN ALL THE HIGHER TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS SUCH A METHOD OF INCREASE HAS DISAPPEARED BUT EVEN ON THIS EARTH IT WAS CERTAINLY THE PRIMITIVE METHOD
LORD SAID THE LANDLORD WHAT'S THE HURRY I'M SELLING MY BIT OF A PIG
I WHISPERED PASSIONATE PRAYERS FOR SAFETY THEN I HEARD THE SLOW DELIBERATE SOUND CREEPING TOWARDS ME AGAIN SLOWLY SLOWLY IT DREW NEAR SCRATCHING AGAINST THE WALLS AND TAPPING THE FURNITURE
THAT HAD KEPT OUR RUINOUS REFUGE QUIVERING
I COULD SCARCELY STAND UPRIGHT I OPENED THE DOOR OF THE COAL CELLAR AND STOOD THERE IN THE DARKNESS STARING AT THE FAINTLY LIT DOORWAY INTO THE KITCHEN AND LISTENING HAD THE MARTIAN SEEN ME WHAT WAS IT DOING NOW
IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY DID TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF WORK AS EVEN ON EARTH IS PERHAPS THE CASE WITH THE ANTS IN THE NEXT PLACE WONDERFUL AS IT SEEMS IN A SEXUAL WORLD THE MARTIANS WERE ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT SEX
BUT OF ALL THIS I HAVE NO MEMORY I DRIFTED A DEMENTED MAN I FOUND MYSELF IN A HOUSE OF KINDLY PEOPLE WHO HAD FOUND ME ON THE THIRD DAY WANDERING WEEPING AND RAVING THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAINT JOHN'S WOOD
AND SUCH MORBIDITIES NEVER ENTER THE SCHEME OF THEIR LIFE AND SPEAKING OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LIFE ON MARS AND TERRESTRIAL LIFE I MAY ALLUDE HERE TO THE CURIOUS SUGGESTIONS OF THE RED WEED
HAD IMMEDIATELY TO TURN MY ATTENTION TO THE HORSE WHEN I LOOKED BACK AGAIN THE SECOND HILL HAD HIDDEN THE BLACK SMOKE I SLASHED THE HORSE WITH THE WHIP AND GAVE HIM A LOOSE REIN UNTIL WOKING AND SEND LAY BETWEEN US AND THAT QUIVERING TUMULT
AT FIRST I SCARCELY NOTICED THE PIT AND THE CYLINDER
OVER THAT ASPECT WE HUNG NOW ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE GREAT CIRCULAR PIT THE MARTIANS WERE ENGAGED IN MAKING THE HEAVY BEATING SOUND WAS EVIDENTLY JUST BEHIND US AND EVER AND AGAIN A BRIGHT GREEN VAPOUR DROVE UP LIKE A VEIL ACROSS OUR PEEPHOLE
THEN I FETCHED OUT THE SERVANT TELLING HER I WOULD GO UPSTAIRS MYSELF FOR THE BOX SHE WAS CLAMOURING FOR WE CAN'T POSSIBLY STAY HERE I SAID AND AS I SPOKE THE FIRING REOPENED FOR A MOMENT UPON THE COMMON
DIRTY RED JACKETS UNBUTTONED
AT WATERLOO I FOUND THE FREE TRAINS THAT WERE TAKING PEOPLE TO THEIR HOMES THE FIRST RUSH WAS ALREADY OVER THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE IN THE TRAIN AND I WAS IN NO MOOD FOR CASUAL CONVERSATION I GOT A COMPARTMENT TO MYSELF
I REMEMBER HOW MOCKINGLY BRIGHT THE DAY SEEMED AS I WENT BACK ON MY MELANCHOLY PILGRIMAGE TO THE LITTLE HOUSE AT WOKING HOW BUSY THE STREETS AND VIVID THE MOVING LIFE ABOUT ME SO MANY PEOPLE WERE ABROAD EVERYWHERE BUSIED IN A THOUSAND ACTIVITIES
AND TO WOKING ON THE WEST THE ROAD WAS DOTTED WITH PEOPLE RUNNING TOWARDS US AND VERY FAINT NOW BUT VERY DISTINCT THROUGH THE HOT QUIET AIR ONE HEARD THE WHIRR OF A MACHINE GUN
THE TUNICATES THE TWO PROCESSES OCCUR SIDE BY SIDE BUT FINALLY THE SEXUAL METHOD SUPERSEDED ITS COMPETITOR ALTOGETHER ON MARS HOWEVER JUST THE REVERSE HAS APPARENTLY BEEN THE CASE
SEVERAL SUCH WANDERERS AS MYSELF HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED THIS ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT ONE MAN THE FIRST HAD GONE TO SAINT MARTIN'S LE GRAND AND WHILE I SHELTERED IN THE CABMEN'S HUT HAD CONTRIVED TO TELEGRAPH TO PARIS
UPON THE FLOWER BED BY MY STUDY WINDOW I AND MY WIFE STOOD AMAZED
AND CAUSED NO MORE DISTURBANCE THAN DRUNKARDS MIGHT HAVE DONE PEOPLE RATTLING LONDONWARDS PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE CARRIAGE WINDOWS AND SAW ONLY A RARE FLICKERING VANISHING SPARK DANCE UP FROM THE DIRECTION OF HORSELL
BEYOND WAS A FRINGE OF EXCITEMENT AND FARTHER THAN THAT FRINGE THE INFLAMMATION HAD NOT CREPT AS YET IN THE REST OF THE WORLD THE STREAM OF LIFE
THE LATTER GIVING RISE TO THE TWO BUNCHES OF DELICATE TENTACLES AT LAST AT THE EXPENSE OF THE REST OF THE BODY WITHOUT THE BODY THE BRAIN WOULD OF COURSE
HE CAME UP TO THE FENCE AND EXTENDED A HANDFUL OF STRAWBERRIES FOR HIS GARDENING WAS AS GENEROUS AS IT WAS ENTHUSIASTIC AT THE SAME TIME HE TOLD ME OF THE BURNING OF THE PINE WOODS ABOUT THE BYFLEET GOLF LINKS
AND AS NOISELESSLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE DARKNESS AMONG THE FIREWOOD AND COAL THEREIN EVERY NOW AND THEN I PAUSED RIGID TO HEAR IF THE MARTIAN HAD THRUST ITS TENTACLES THROUGH THE OPENING AGAIN THEN THE FAINT METALLIC JINGLE RETURNED
AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE STANDING LIKEWISE AND EXTENDING HIS ARMS SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD IS UPON ME IN THREE STRIDES HE WAS AT THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE KITCHEN
I SHOUTED AFTER HIM WHAT NEWS HE TURNED STARED BAWLED SOMETHING ABOUT CRAWLING OUT IN A THING LIKE A DISH COVER
THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES WERE CERTAINLY ALIVE TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE BUSINESS
TO AN INTELLIGENT RABBIT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES OF THE PRACTICE OF INJECTION ARE UNDENIABLE IF ONE THINKS OF THE TREMENDOUS WASTE OF HUMAN TIME AND ENERGY OCCASIONED BY EATING AND THE DIGESTIVE PROCESS
TALK ABOUT FISHERS OF MEN FIGHTERS OF FISH IT IS THIS TIME IT AIN'T NO MURDER KILLING BEASTS LIKE THAT SAID THE FIRST SPEAKER
SO THEY DISCUSSED IT AFTER A WHILE I LEFT THEM AND WENT ON TO THE RAILWAY STATION TO GET AS MANY MORNING PAPERS AS I COULD BUT I WILL NOT WEARY THE READER WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THAT LONG MORNING AND OF THE LONGER AFTERNOON
THESE PEOPLE WHOSE NAME MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THEM I MAY NOT EVEN GIVE HERE NEVERTHELESS CUMBERED THEMSELVES WITH ME SHELTERED ME AND PROTECTED ME FROM MYSELF
A SUDDEN WHIRL OF BLACK SMOKE DRIVING ACROSS THE ROAD HID HIM FOR A MOMENT I RAN TO MY NEIGHBOUR'S DOOR AND RAPPED TO SATISFY MYSELF OF WHAT I ALREADY KNEW THAT HIS WIFE HAD GONE TO LONDON WITH HIM
A MAN STANDING AT AN OPEN COTTAGE DOOR GREETED ME BY NAME AS I PASSED I LOOKED AT MY HOUSE WITH A QUICK FLASH OF HOPE THAT FADED IMMEDIATELY THE DOOR HAD BEEN FORCED IT WAS UNFAST AND WAS OPENING SLOWLY AS I APPROACHED
ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK THERE BEGAN THE THUD OF A GUN AT MEASURED INTERVALS FROM CHERTSEY OR ADDLESTONE I LEARNED THAT THE SMOULDERING PINE WOOD INTO WHICH THE SECOND CYLINDER HAD FALLEN WAS BEING SHELLED
AND WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF JOINTED LEVERS BARS AND REACHING AND CLUTCHING TENTACLES ABOUT ITS BODY MOST OF ITS ARMS WERE RETRACTED BUT WITH THREE LONG TENTACLES IT WAS FISHING OUT A NUMBER OF RODS PLATES AND BARS WHICH LINED THE COVERING AND APPARENTLY STRENGTHENED THE WALLS OF THE CYLINDER
EVEN AS I SAW THESE MARTIANS FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY SEEMED TO BE ENDEAVOURING TO RAISE THEMSELVES ON THESE HANDS BUT OF COURSE WITH THE INCREASED WEIGHT OF TERRESTRIAL CONDITIONS THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE THERE IS REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT ON MARS THEY MAY HAVE PROGRESSED UPON THEM WITH SOME FACILITY
WHILE I WAS STILL DOUBTFUL IT RAPPED SMARTLY AGAINST THE CELLAR DOOR AND CLOSED IT I HEARD IT GO INTO THE PANTRY AND THE BISCUIT TINS RATTLED AND A BOTTLE SMASHED AND THEN CAME A HEAVY BUMP AGAINST THE CELLAR DOOR THEN SILENCE THAT PASSED
INTO THE RECIPIENT CANAL THE BARE IDEA OF THIS IS NO DOUBT HORRIBLY REPULSIVE TO US
HOW ARE WE TO GET TO LEATHERHEAD SHE SAID
IN A LONG DEFUNCT PUBLICATION THE PALL MALL BUDGET AND I RECALL A CARICATURE OF IT IN A PRE MARTIAN PERIODICAL CALLED PUNCH HE POINTED OUT WRITING IN A FOOLISH FACETIOUS TONE
ALL THAT I DID THAT DAY UNTIL THE TIME THAT I STOOD WEEPING AND PRAISING GOD UPON THE SUMMIT OF PRIMROSE HILL AND THEN I FORGET OF THE NEXT THREE DAYS I KNOW NOTHING I HAVE LEARNED SINCE THAT SO FAR FROM MY BEING THE FIRST DISCOVERER OF THE MARTIAN OVERTHROW
SINCE KNOWN TO BE ANATOMICALLY AN EAR THOUGH IT MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST USELESS
TO THE BLUE GREEN SOFTNESS OF THE EASTWARD HILLS THE LINE ON THE LONDON SIDE OF WOKING STATION WAS STILL UNDERGOING REPAIR SO I DESCENDED AT BYFLEET STATION AND TOOK THE ROAD TO MAYBURY
IN THE MERE WANTONNESS OF POWER I WAS A LONELY MAN AND THEY WERE VERY KIND TO ME I WAS A LONELY MAN AND A SAD ONE AND THEY BORE WITH ME I REMAINED WITH THEM FOUR DAYS AFTER MY RECOVERY
THEIR IDEA WAS THAT A DISPUTE HAD ARISEN AT THE HORSE GUARDS THE ORDINARY SAPPER IS A GREAT DEAL BETTER EDUCATED THAN THE COMMON SOLDIER AND THEY DISCUSSED THE PECULIAR CONDITIONS OF THE POSSIBLE FIGHT WITH SOME ACUTENESS
HE THREATENED HE WOULD SHOUT AND BRING THE MARTIANS UPON US FOR A TIME THAT SCARED ME
IS OF A VIVID BLOOD RED TINT AT ANY RATE THE SEEDS WHICH THE MARTIANS INTENTIONALLY OR ACCIDENTALLY BROUGHT WITH THEM GAVE RISE IN ALL CASES TO RED COLOURED GROWTHS ONLY THAT KNOWN POPULARLY AS THE RED WEED HOWEVER
BUT THE POISON WAS SCARCELY WORKING YET AROUND IT WAS A PATCH OF SILENT COMMON
I DID NOT SUCCEED IN GETTING A GLIMPSE OF THE COMMON FOR EVEN HORSELL AND CHOBHAM CHURCH TOWERS WERE IN THE HANDS OF THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES THE SOLDIERS I ADDRESSED DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
THAT LITTERED THE FLOOR I TOUCHED THE CURATE'S LEG AND HE STARTED SO VIOLENTLY THAT A MASS OF PLASTER WENT SLIDING DOWN OUTSIDE AND FELL WITH A LOUD IMPACT I GRIPPED HIS ARM FEARING HE MIGHT CRY OUT AND FOR A LONG TIME WE CROUCHED MOTIONLESS
IT IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED THAT THEY COMMUNICATED BY SOUNDS AND TENTACULAR GESTICULATIONS THIS IS ASSERTED FOR INSTANCE IN THE ABLE BUT HASTILY COMPILED PAMPHLET WRITTEN EVIDENTLY BY SOMEONE NOT AN EYE WITNESS OF MARTIAN ACTIONS
IN A GROUP ROUND THE MOUTH WERE SIXTEEN SLENDER ALMOST WHIPLIKE TENTACLES ARRANGED IN TWO BUNCHES OF EIGHT EACH THESE BUNCHES HAVE SINCE BEEN NAMED RATHER APTLY BY THAT DISTINGUISHED ANATOMIST PROFESSOR HOWES THE HANDS
NOISE OF HAMMERING FROM THE PIT WAS HEARD BY MANY PEOPLE SO YOU HAVE THE STATE OF THINGS ON FRIDAY NIGHT IN THE CENTRE STICKING INTO THE SKIN OF OUR OLD PLANET EARTH LIKE A POISONED DART WAS THIS CYLINDER
CAUSED A WHIRL OF EXCITEMENT A SHOUTING AND A RUNNING TO AND FRO BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE DAILY ROUTINE OF WORKING EATING DRINKING SLEEPING WENT ON AS IT HAD DONE FOR COUNTLESS YEARS
FOR A SPACE I STOOD READING OVER MY ABANDONED ARGUMENTS IT WAS A PAPER ON THE PROBABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MORAL IDEAS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CIVILISING PROCESS AND THE LAST SENTENCE WAS THE OPENING OF A PROPHECY
I WAS STARTLED HAD I SPOKEN MY THOUGHT ALOUD I TURNED AND THE FRENCH WINDOW WAS OPEN BEHIND ME I MADE A STEP TO IT AND STOOD LOOKING OUT AND THERE
THEY HAVE TOLD ME SINCE THAT I WAS SINGING SOME INSANE DOGGEREL ABOUT THE LAST MAN LEFT ALIVE HURRAH THE LAST MAN LEFT ALIVE
SWEPT THE COMMON AND THE HEAT RAY WAS READY TO FOLLOW SAVE FOR SUCH THAT BIG AREA OF COMMON WAS SILENT AND DESOLATE AND THE CHARRED BODIES LAY ABOUT ON IT ALL NIGHT UNDER THE STARS AND ALL THE NEXT DAY A
THEY SAID THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD
INSTEAD OF KEEPING CLOSE TO ME AND TRYING TO OUST ME FROM THE SLIT THE CURATE HAD GONE BACK INTO THE SCULLERY I WAS STRUCK BY A SUDDEN THOUGHT I WENT BACK QUICKLY AND QUIETLY INTO THE SCULLERY IN THE DARKNESS I HEARD THE CURATE DRINKING
SAID MY WIFE IN TERROR I THOUGHT PERPLEXED THEN I REMEMBERED HER COUSINS AT LEATHERHEAD LEATHERHEAD I SHOUTED ABOVE THE SUDDEN NOISE SHE LOOKED AWAY FROM ME DOWNHILL THE PEOPLE WERE COMING OUT OF THEIR HOUSES ASTONISHED
AMAZED AND AFRAID EVEN AS I STOOD AMAZED AND AFRAID WERE MY COUSIN AND MY WIFE MY WIFE WHITE AND TEARLESS SHE GAVE A FAINT CRY I CAME SHE SAID
AND SEEMED TO GO OUT OF THE CELLAR AGAIN FOR A MINUTE I WAS NOT SURE APPARENTLY IT HAD TAKEN A LUMP OF COAL TO EXAMINE I SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF SLIGHTLY SHIFTING MY POSITION WHICH HAD BECOME CRAMPED AND THEN LISTENED
I WHISPERED FOR THE CURATE SEVERAL TIMES AND AT LAST FELT MY WAY TO THE DOOR OF THE KITCHEN IT WAS STILL DAYLIGHT AND I PERCEIVED HIM ACROSS THE ROOM LYING AGAINST THE TRIANGULAR HOLE THAT LOOKED OUT UPON THE MARTIANS
THE FIGHTING BEGINS SATURDAY LIVES IN MY MEMORY AS A DAY OF SUSPENSE IT WAS A DAY OF LASSITUDE TOO HOT AND CLOSE WITH I AM TOLD A RAPIDLY FLUCTUATING BAROMETER
I HAD SLEPT BUT LITTLE THOUGH MY WIFE HAD SUCCEEDED IN SLEEPING AND I ROSE EARLY
WE STOOD PANTING AND THREATENING EACH OTHER IN THE END I PLANTED MYSELF BETWEEN HIM AND THE FOOD AND TOLD HIM OF MY DETERMINATION TO BEGIN A DISCIPLINE I DIVIDED THE FOOD IN THE PANTRY INTO RATIONS TO LAST US TEN DAYS I WOULD NOT LET HIM EAT ANY MORE THAT DAY
THEY DID ALL THEY COULD TO DIVERT ME FROM THIS MORBIDITY BUT AT LAST I COULD RESIST THE IMPULSE NO LONGER AND PROMISING FAITHFULLY TO RETURN TO THEM AND PARTING AS I WILL CONFESS FROM THESE FOUR DAY FRIENDS WITH TEARS
OF ALL THE STRANGE AND WONDERFUL THINGS THAT HAPPENED UPON THAT FRIDAY WAS THE DOVETAILING OF THE COMMONPLACE HABITS OF OUR SOCIAL ORDER WITH THE FIRST BEGINNINGS OF THE SERIES OF EVENTS THAT WAS TO TOPPLE THAT SOCIAL ORDER HEADLONG
ABOUT ELEVEN A COMPANY OF SOLDIERS CAME THROUGH HORSELL
I DESCRIBED THE HEAT RAY TO THEM AND THEY BEGAN TO ARGUE AMONG THEMSELVES CRAWL UP UNDER COVER AND RUSH EM SAY I SAID ONE
WOE WOE TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH BY REASON OF THE OTHER VOICES OF THE TRUMPET SHUT UP I SAID RISING TO MY FEET AND IN A TERROR LEST THE MARTIANS SHOULD HEAR US FOR GOD'S SAKE NAY SHOUTED THE CURATE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN THESE STRUCTURES AND HAVE ONLY THE ILL IMAGINED EFFORTS OF ARTISTS OR THE IMPERFECT DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH EYE WITNESSES AS MYSELF TO GO UPON SCARCELY REALISE THAT LIVING QUALITY I RECALL PARTICULARLY THE ILLUSTRATION
AND SILENT ELOQUENT LIPS HE WANTED THE SLIT WHICH PERMITTED ONLY ONE OF US TO PEEP THROUGH AND SO I HAD TO FOREGO WATCHING THEM FOR A TIME WHILE HE ENJOYED THAT PRIVILEGE WHEN I LOOKED AGAIN
HAD BEEN ON THE COMMON EARLIER IN THE DAY
I RAN FOR I PERCEIVED THAT IN A MOMENT EVERYONE UPON THIS SIDE OF THE HILL WOULD BE MOVING I FOUND HIM IN HIS BAR QUITE UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON BEHIND HIS HOUSE A MAN STOOD
IN APPEARANCE BETWEEN BUTCHER'S MEAT AND PICKLED CABBAGE THE SURREY PINE WOODS WERE TOO DRY HOWEVER FOR THE FESTOONS OF THE RED CLIMBER BEYOND WIMBLEDON WITHIN SIGHT OF THE LINE IN CERTAIN NURSERY GROUNDS
SOMETHING WAS MOVING TO AND FRO THERE VERY QUIETLY EVERY NOW AND THEN IT TAPPED AGAINST THE WALL OR STARTED ON ITS MOVEMENTS WITH A FAINT METALLIC RINGING LIKE THE MOVEMENTS OF KEYS ON A SPLIT RING
AND AN ALMOST CONTINUOUS STREAMER OF SMOKE
WALTON BY VIRTUE OF ITS UNBURNED PINE WOODS SEEMED THE LEAST HURT OF ANY PLACE ALONG THE LINE
OR TO DESTROY THE MARTIANS DURING THE DAY IT'S A PITY THEY MAKE THEMSELVES SO UNAPPROACHABLE HE SAID IT WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW THEY LIVE ON ANOTHER PLANET
BESIDES THIS WERE THE BULKY LUNGS INTO WHICH THE MOUTH OPENED AND THE HEART AND ITS VESSELS THE PULMONARY DISTRESS CAUSED BY THE DENSER ATMOSPHERE AND GREATER GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION WAS ONLY TOO EVIDENT IN THE CONVULSIVE MOVEMENTS OF THE OUTER SKIN
PERHAPS NOTHING IS MORE WONDERFUL TO A MAN THAN THE CURIOUS FACT THAT WHAT IS THE DOMINANT FEATURE OF ALMOST ALL HUMAN DEVICES IN MECHANISM IS ABSENT THE WHEEL IS ABSENT
AND NOT ONLY WERE THEY EVIDENTLY MUCH LESS SENSIBLE OF CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE THAN WE ARE BUT CHANGES OF PRESSURE DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE AFFECTED THEIR HEALTH AT ALL SERIOUSLY YET THOUGH THEY WORE NO CLOTHING
AND HERE AND THERE A MESSENGER
ALL THAT TIME I FELT A VAGUE A GROWING CRAVING TO LOOK ONCE MORE ON WHATEVER REMAINED OF THE LITTLE LIFE THAT SEEMED SO HAPPY AND BRIGHT IN MY PAST IT WAS A MERE HOPELESS DESIRE TO FEAST UPON MY MISERY THEY DISSUADED ME
THEN I TURNED TO SEE HOW MUCH OF OUR RAMPART REMAINED THE DETACHMENT OF THE PLASTER HAD LEFT A VERTICAL SLIT OPEN IN THE DEBRIS AND BY RAISING MYSELF CAUTIOUSLY ACROSS A BEAM I WAS ABLE TO SEE OUT OF THIS GAP INTO WHAT HAD BEEN OVERNIGHT A QUIET SUBURBAN ROADWAY
AND ALWAYS FROTHY REPENTANCE FOR HIS VACANT SHAM OF GOD'S SERVICE SUCH AS MADE ME PITY HIM THEN HE SLEPT AWHILE AND BEGAN AGAIN WITH RENEWED STRENGTH SO LOUDLY THAT I MUST NEEDS MAKE HIM DESIST BE STILL I IMPLORED
NOW THAT THE COLLEGE WAS CLEARED OUT OF THE WAY AT THAT
FOR THE MERE ATTEMPT TO STAND UPRIGHT UPON OUR PLANET WOULD HAVE BROKEN EVERY BONE IN THEIR BODIES AND WHILE I AM ENGAGED IN THIS DESCRIPTION I MAY ADD IN THIS PLACE CERTAIN FURTHER DETAILS WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT ALL EVIDENT TO US AT THE TIME
AS AN OCCASIONAL READER HERE OR THERE MAY REMEMBER I HAD WRITTEN WITH SOME LITTLE VEHEMENCE AGAINST THE TELEPATHIC THEORY THE MARTIANS WORE NO CLOTHING THEIR CONCEPTIONS OF ORNAMENT AND DECORUM WERE NECESSARILY DIFFERENT FROM OURS
THEY SAY SAID HE THAT THERE'S ANOTHER OF THOSE BLESSED THINGS FALLEN THERE NUMBER TWO BUT ONE'S ENOUGH SURELY THIS LOT'LL COST THE INSURANCE PEOPLE A PRETTY PENNY BEFORE EVERYTHING'S SETTLED
OUR MUDDY FOOTSTEPS I SAW STILL WENT UP THE STAIRS I FOLLOWED THEM TO MY STUDY AND FOUND LYING ON MY WRITING TABLE STILL WITH THE SELENITE PAPER WEIGHT UPON IT THE SHEET OF WORK I HAD LEFT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE OPENING OF THE CYLINDER
THE RUDIMENTARY PRECAUTIONS TO KEEP OUR IMPRISONMENT ENDURABLE HE WOULD NOT OBSERVE SLOWLY I BEGAN TO REALISE THE COMPLETE OVERTHROW OF HIS INTELLIGENCE TO PERCEIVE THAT MY SOLE COMPANION IN THIS CLOSE AND SICKLY DARKNESS WAS A MAN INSANE
THEN HE WOULD SUDDENLY REVERT TO THE MATTER OF THE FOOD I WITHHELD FROM HIM PRAYING BEGGING WEEPING AT LAST THREATENING HE BEGAN TO RAISE HIS VOICE I PRAYED HIM NOT TO HE PERCEIVED A HOLD ON ME
I WENT IN AGAIN ACCORDING TO MY PROMISE TO GET MY SERVANT'S BOX LUGGED IT OUT
THE RED CREEPER WAS QUITE A TRANSITORY GROWTH AND FEW PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT GROWING FOR A TIME HOWEVER THE RED WEED GREW WITH ASTONISHING VIGOUR AND LUXURIANCE IT SPREAD UP THE SIDES OF THE PIT BY THE THIRD OR FOURTH DAY OF OUR IMPRISONMENT
THESE DISKS BECOME POLARISED AND DRAWN CLOSELY AND POWERFULLY TOGETHER WHEN TRAVERSED BY A CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY IN THIS WAY THE CURIOUS PARALLELISM TO ANIMAL MOTIONS WHICH WAS SO STRIKING AND DISTURBING TO THE HUMAN BEHOLDER WAS ATTAINED
TWO DAYS AFTER I WAS IMPRISONED IT HAD BEEN DESTROYED WITH EVERY SOUL IN IT BY A MARTIAN HE HAD SWEPT IT OUT OF EXISTENCE AS IT SEEMED WITHOUT ANY PROVOCATION AS A BOY MIGHT CRUSH AN ANT HILL
WERE THE HEAPED MASSES OF EARTH ABOUT THE SIXTH CYLINDER A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE STANDING ABOUT IT AND SOME SAPPERS WERE BUSY IN THE MIDST OF IT
AND HIS EVENING PAPER AFTER WIRING FOR AUTHENTICATION FROM HIM AND RECEIVING NO REPLY
AT THE TIME WHEN I STOOD UPON THE VERGE OF THE PIT ALREADY MEN WEEPING WITH JOY AS I HAVE HEARD SHOUTING AND STAYING THEIR WORK TO SHAKE HANDS AND SHOUT WERE MAKING UP TRAINS EVEN AS NEAR AS CREWE TO DESCEND UPON LONDON
THEY DID NOT EAT MUCH LESS DIGEST INSTEAD THEY TOOK THE FRESH LIVING BLOOD OF OTHER CREATURES AND INJECTED IT INTO THEIR OWN VEINS I HAVE MYSELF SEEN THIS BEING DONE AS I SHALL MENTION IN ITS PLACE BUT
TO CLAPHAM JUNCTION THE FACE OF LONDON WAS GRIMY WITH POWDER OF THE BLACK SMOKE IN SPITE OF TWO DAYS OF THUNDERSTORMS AND RAIN AND AT CLAPHAM JUNCTION THE LINE HAD BEEN WRECKED AGAIN THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF OUT OF WORK CLERKS AND SHOPMEN
ITS MOTION WAS SO SWIFT COMPLEX AND PERFECT THAT AT FIRST I DID NOT SEE IT AS A MACHINE IN SPITE OF ITS METALLIC GLITTER THE FIGHTING MACHINES WERE COORDINATED AND ANIMATED TO AN EXTRAORDINARY PITCH BUT NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH THIS
AND NOTHING I COULD DO WOULD MODERATE HIS SPEECH IT IS JUST O GOD HE WOULD SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT IS JUST ON ME AND MINE BE THE PUNISHMENT LAID WE HAVE SINNED WE HAVE FALLEN SHORT THERE WAS POVERTY SORROW
AND SAT WITH FOLDED ARMS LOOKING GREYLY AT THE SUNLIT DEVASTATION THAT FLOWED PAST THE WINDOWS AND JUST OUTSIDE THE TERMINUS THE TRAIN JOLTED OVER TEMPORARY RAILS AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RAILWAY THE HOUSES WERE BLACKENED RUINS
SHOUTING TO GAUNT STARING FIGURES OF DESPAIR AND FOR THE FOOD ACROSS THE CHANNEL ACROSS THE IRISH SEA ACROSS THE ATLANTIC CORN BREAD AND MEAT WERE TEARING TO OUR RELIEF ALL THE SHIPPING IN THE WORLD SEEMED GOING LONDONWARD IN THOSE DAYS
OUR BODIES ARE HALF MADE UP OF GLANDS AND TUBES AND ORGANS OCCUPIED IN TURNING HETEROGENEOUS FOOD INTO BLOOD THE DIGESTIVE PROCESSES AND THEIR REACTION UPON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SAP OUR STRENGTH AND COLOUR OUR MINDS
TO ONE PLANE ALMOST ALL THE JOINTS OF THE MACHINERY PRESENT A COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF SLIDING PARTS MOVING OVER SMALL BUT BEAUTIFULLY CURVED FRICTION BEARINGS AND WHILE UPON THIS MATTER OF DETAIL IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE LONG LEVERAGES OF THEIR MACHINES
TO MY MIND THE PAMPHLET WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER WITHOUT THEM AT FIRST I SAY THE HANDLING MACHINE DID NOT IMPRESS ME AS A MACHINE BUT AS A CRABLIKE CREATURE WITH A GLITTERING INTEGUMENT THE CONTROLLING MARTIAN WHOSE DELICATE TENTACLES ACTUATED ITS MOVEMENTS
ONCE EVEN IT TOUCHED THE HEEL OF MY BOOT I WAS ON THE VERGE OF SCREAMING I BIT MY HAND FOR A TIME THE TENTACLE WAS SILENT I COULD HAVE FANCIED IT HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN PRESENTLY WITH AN ABRUPT CLICK IT GRIPPED SOMETHING I THOUGHT IT HAD ME
AND IN THIS MATTER I AM CONVINCED AS FIRMLY AS I AM CONVINCED OF ANYTHING THAT THE MARTIANS INTERCHANGED THOUGHTS WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL INTERMEDIATION AND I HAVE BEEN CONVINCED OF THIS IN SPITE OF STRONG PRECONCEPTIONS BEFORE THE MARTIAN INVASION
THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN VILLAS BURNING ON THE WOKING BORDER
MEN GO HAPPY OR MISERABLE AS THEY HAVE HEALTHY OR UNHEALTHY LIVERS OR SOUND GASTRIC GLANDS BUT THE MARTIANS WERE LIFTED ABOVE ALL THESE ORGANIC FLUCTUATIONS OF MOOD AND EMOTION THEIR UNDENIABLE PREFERENCE FOR MEN AS THEIR SOURCE OF NOURISHMENT
SUCH QUASI MUSCLES ABOUNDED IN THE CRABLIKE HANDLING MACHINE WHICH ON MY FIRST PEEPING OUT OF THE SLIT I WATCHED UNPACKING THE CYLINDER IT SEEMED INFINITELY MORE ALIVE THAN THE ACTUAL MARTIANS LYING BEYOND IT IN THE SUNSET LIGHT PANTING STIRRING INEFFECTUAL TENTACLES
AND THE STUDY OF WHICH HAS ALREADY GIVEN SUCH AN ENORMOUS IMPETUS TO TERRESTRIAL INVENTION AS IT DAWNED UPON ME FIRST IT PRESENTED A SORT OF METALLIC SPIDER WITH FIVE JOINTED AGILE LEGS
THERE WERE THE MUTTON AND THE BREAD BOTH FAR GONE NOW IN DECAY AND A BEER BOTTLE OVERTURNED JUST AS I AND THE ARTILLERYMAN HAD LEFT THEM MY HOME WAS DESOLATE I PERCEIVED THE FOLLY OF THE FAINT HOPE I HAD CHERISHED SO LONG
INTO A SHAPE HAVING AN UNMISTAKABLE LIKENESS TO ITS OWN AND DOWN ON THE LEFT A BUSY LITTLE DIGGING MECHANISM HAD COME INTO VIEW EMITTING JETS OF GREEN VAPOUR AND WORKING ITS WAY ROUND THE PIT EXCAVATING AND EMBANKING IN A METHODICAL AND DISCRIMINATING MANNER
IT WAS IN THE OTHER ARTIFICIAL ADDITIONS TO THEIR BODILY RESOURCES THAT THEIR GREAT SUPERIORITY OVER MAN LAY WE MEN WITH OUR BICYCLES AND ROAD SKATES OUR LILIENTHAL SOARING MACHINES OUR GUNS AND STICKS AND SO FORTH ARE JUST IN THE BEGINNING OF THE EVOLUTION THAT THE MARTIANS HAVE WORKED OUT
SINCE THEY HAD NO EXTENSIVE MUSCULAR MECHANISM TO RECUPERATE THAT PERIODICAL EXTINCTION WAS UNKNOWN TO THEM THEY HAD LITTLE OR NO SENSE OF FATIGUE IT WOULD SEEM ON EARTH THEY COULD NEVER HAVE MOVED WITHOUT EFFORT YET EVEN TO THE LAST THEY KEPT IN ACTION
THE NURSERY GROUNDS WERE EVERYWHERE CRIMSON WITH THE WEED
WITH THAT REALISATION MY INTEREST SHIFTED TO THOSE OTHER CREATURES THE REAL MARTIANS
AND THE MAYBURY INN WITH ITS SWINGING SIGN I SAW THE DOCTOR'S CART AHEAD OF ME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL I TURNED MY HEAD TO LOOK AT THE HILLSIDE I WAS LEAVING THICK STREAMERS OF BLACK SMOKE
AND THE FIRST NAUSEA NO LONGER OBSCURED MY OBSERVATION MOREOVER I WAS CONCEALED AND MOTIONLESS AND UNDER NO URGENCY OF ACTION THEY WERE I NOW SAW THE MOST UNEARTHLY CREATURES IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE THEY WERE HUGE ROUND BODIES
AND VERY PAINFUL TO THE EYE
OF ONE OF THE FIRST PAMPHLETS TO GIVE A CONSECUTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE WAR THE ARTIST HAD EVIDENTLY MADE A HASTY STUDY OF ONE OF THE FIGHTING MACHINES AND THERE HIS KNOWLEDGE ENDED HE PRESENTED THEM AS TILTED STIFF TRIPODS WITHOUT EITHER FLEXIBILITY OR SUBTLETY
SEEMING TO BE SIMPLY THE EQUIVALENT OF THE CRAB'S CEREBRAL PORTION BUT THEN I PERCEIVED THE RESEMBLANCE OF ITS GREY BROWN SHINY LEATHERY INTEGUMENT TO THAT OF THE OTHER SPRAWLING BODIES BEYOND AND THE TRUE NATURE OF THIS DEXTEROUS WORKMAN DAWNED UPON ME
STUDENTS SAT OVER THEIR BOOKS MAYBE THERE WAS A MURMUR IN THE VILLAGE STREETS
AND IN ORDER TO REFRESH MYSELF I TOOK A COLD BATH IN THE AFTERNOON ABOUT HALF PAST FOUR I WENT UP TO THE RAILWAY STATION TO GET AN EVENING PAPER FOR THE MORNING PAPERS HAD CONTAINED ONLY A VERY INACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF THE KILLING OF STENT
I HAD BEEN DOZING BUT IN AN INSTANT I WAS AWAKE ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT WE SAT FACE TO FACE I WEARY BUT RESOLUTE AND HE WEEPING AND COMPLAINING OF HIS IMMEDIATE HUNGER
FRESH ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO SIGNAL BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS WAS THE STEREOTYPED FORMULA OF THE PAPERS A SAPPER TOLD ME IT WAS DONE BY A MAN IN A DITCH WITH A FLAG ON A LONG POLE THE MARTIANS TOOK AS MUCH NOTICE OF SUCH ADVANCES
THAT HIS SON WAS AMONG THE DEAD ON THE COMMON THE SOLDIERS HAD MADE THE PEOPLE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF HORSELL LOCK UP AND LEAVE THEIR HOUSES I GOT BACK TO LUNCH ABOUT TWO VERY TIRED FOR AS I HAVE SAID THE DAY WAS EXTREMELY HOT AND DULL
I SAW ONE OF THE CARDIGAN MEN STANDING SENTINEL THERE I TALKED WITH THESE SOLDIERS FOR A TIME I TOLD THEM OF MY SIGHT OF THE MARTIANS ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING NONE OF THEM HAD SEEN THE MARTIANS
I PUT OUT MY HAND AND FELT THE MEAT CHOPPER HANGING TO THE WALL IN A FLASH I WAS AFTER HIM I WAS FIERCE WITH FEAR
AND I ASSERT THAT I WATCHED THEM CLOSELY TIME AFTER TIME AND THAT I HAVE SEEN FOUR FIVE AND ONCE SIX OF THEM SLUGGISHLY PERFORMING THE MOST ELABORATELY COMPLICATED OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITHOUT EITHER SOUND OR GESTURE THEIR PECULIAR HOOTING
TWO MAXIMS AND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MEN OF THE CARDIGAN REGIMENT STARTED FROM ALDERSHOT A FEW SECONDS AFTER MIDNIGHT
CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF THAT CAME A VIOLENT RATTLING CRASH QUITE CLOSE TO US THAT SHOOK THE GROUND AND STARTING OUT UPON THE LAWN I SAW THE TOPS OF THE TREES ABOUT THE ORIENTAL COLLEGE BURST INTO SMOKY RED FLAME
AND ON BY THE SPOT WHERE THE MARTIAN HAD APPEARED TO ME IN THE THUNDERSTORM HERE MOVED BY CURIOSITY I TURNED ASIDE TO FIND AMONG A TANGLE OF RED FRONDS THE WARPED AND BROKEN DOG CART
WRITING LONG BEFORE THE MARTIAN INVASION DID FORECAST FOR MAN A FINAL STRUCTURE NOT UNLIKE THE ACTUAL MARTIAN CONDITION HIS PROPHECY I REMEMBER APPEARED IN NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE
FROM CERTAIN VAGUE MEMORIES I AM INCLINED TO THINK MY OWN MIND WANDERED AT TIMES I HAD STRANGE AND HIDEOUS DREAMS WHENEVER I SLEPT IT SOUNDS PARADOXICAL BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE WEAKNESS AND INSANITY OF THE CURATE WARNED ME BRACED ME AND KEPT ME A SANE MAN
AND THE TOWER OF THE LITTLE CHURCH BESIDE IT SLIDE DOWN INTO RUIN THE PINNACLE OF THE MOSQUE HAD VANISHED AND THE ROOF LINE OF THE COLLEGE ITSELF
A RED GLOW AND A THIN VEIL OF SMOKE DRIVING ACROSS THE STARS AND THOUGHT THAT NOTHING MORE SERIOUS THAN A HEATH FIRE WAS HAPPENING IT WAS ONLY ROUND THE EDGE OF THE COMMON THAT ANY DISTURBANCE WAS PERCEPTIBLE
I LEARNED NOTHING FRESH EXCEPT THAT ALREADY IN ONE WEEK THE EXAMINATION OF THE MARTIAN MECHANISMS HAD YIELDED ASTONISHING RESULTS AMONG OTHER THINGS THE ARTICLE ASSURED ME WHAT I DID NOT BELIEVE AT THE TIME THAT THE SECRET OF FLYING WAS DISCOVERED
AND FEEBLE MUSCULATURE STANDING ABOUT SIX FEET HIGH AND HAVING ROUND ERECT HEADS AND LARGE EYES IN FLINTY SOCKETS TWO OR THREE OF THESE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN EACH CYLINDER AND ALL WERE KILLED BEFORE EARTH WAS REACHED IT WAS JUST AS WELL FOR THEM
IS PARTLY EXPLAINED BY THE NATURE OF THE REMAINS OF THE VICTIMS THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM AS PROVISIONS FROM MARS THESE CREATURES TO JUDGE FROM THE SHRIVELLED REMAINS THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO HUMAN HANDS WERE BIPEDS WITH FLIMSY SILICIOUS SKELETONS ALMOST LIKE THOSE OF THE SILICIOUS SPONGES
A CURIOUS CROWD LINGERED RESTLESSLY PEOPLE COMING AND GOING BUT THE CROWD REMAINING
AND MOVING FEEBLY AFTER THEIR VAST JOURNEY ACROSS SPACE WHILE I WAS STILL WATCHING THEIR SLUGGISH MOTIONS IN THE SUNLIGHT AND NOTING EACH STRANGE DETAIL OF THEIR FORM THE CURATE REMINDED ME OF HIS PRESENCE BY PULLING VIOLENTLY AT MY ARM I TURNED TO A SCOWLING FACE
AND TWISTING AND TURNING WITH QUEER SUDDEN MOVEMENTS THIS WAY AND THAT FOR A WHILE I STOOD FASCINATED BY THAT SLOW FITFUL ADVANCE THEN WITH A FAINT HOARSE CRY I FORCED MYSELF ACROSS THE SCULLERY I TREMBLED VIOLENTLY
ABOUT SIX IN THE EVENING AS I SAT AT TEA WITH MY WIFE IN THE SUMMERHOUSE TALKING VIGOROUSLY ABOUT THE BATTLE THAT WAS LOWERING UPON US I HEARD A MUFFLED DETONATION FROM THE COMMON AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER A GUST OF FIRING
IT SLAMMED AGAIN THE CURTAINS OF MY STUDY FLUTTERED OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW FROM WHICH I AND THE ARTILLERYMAN HAD WATCHED THE DAWN NO ONE HAD CLOSED IT SINCE THE SMASHED BUSHES WERE JUST AS I HAD LEFT THEM NEARLY FOUR WEEKS AGO
BUT THE SOLITARY COMPOSITOR WHO DID THE THING HAD AMUSED HIMSELF BY MAKING A GROTESQUE SCHEME OF ADVERTISEMENT STEREO ON THE BACK PAGE THE MATTER HE PRINTED WAS EMOTIONAL THE NEWS ORGANISATION HAD NOT AS YET FOUND ITS WAY BACK
BUT IT HAD A PAIR OF VERY LARGE DARK COLOURED EYES AND JUST BENEATH THIS A KIND OF FLESHY BEAK IN THE BACK OF THIS HEAD OR BODY I SCARCELY KNOW HOW TO SPEAK OF IT WAS THE SINGLE TIGHT TYMPANIC SURFACE
THE EARTH ALL ROUND IT HAD SPLASHED UNDER THAT TREMENDOUS IMPACT SPLASHED IS THE ONLY WORD AND LAY IN HEAPED PILES THAT HID THE MASSES OF THE ADJACENT HOUSES IT HAD BEHAVED EXACTLY LIKE MUD UNDER THE VIOLENT BLOW OF A HAMMER OUR HOUSE HAD COLLAPSED BACKWARD
APPARENTLY THEY HAD LEARNED SOMETHING OF MY STORY FROM ME DURING THE DAYS OF MY LAPSE VERY GENTLY WHEN MY MIND WAS ASSURED AGAIN DID THEY BREAK TO ME WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED OF THE FATE OF LEATHERHEAD
AND THEN STROLLED IN TO BREAKFAST IT WAS A MOST UNEXCEPTIONAL MORNING
ONE OR TWO ADVENTUROUS SOULS IT WAS AFTERWARDS FOUND WENT INTO THE DARKNESS AND CRAWLED QUITE NEAR THE MARTIANS BUT THEY NEVER RETURNED FOR NOW AND AGAIN A LIGHT RAY
ALL OVER THE DISTRICT PEOPLE WERE DINING AND SUPPING WORKING MEN WERE GARDENING AFTER THE LABOURS OF THE DAY
AT WORK UPON THE MACHINES THEY WERE MAKING READY AND EVER AND AGAIN A PUFF OF GREENISH WHITE SMOKE
AND THAT EVERY OTHER MAN STILL WORE HIS DIRTY RAGS THEIR FACES SEEMED ALL WITH ONE OF TWO EXPRESSIONS A LEAPING EXULTATION AND ENERGY OR A GRIM RESOLUTION SAVE FOR THE EXPRESSION OF THE FACES
THE FEVER OF WAR THAT WOULD PRESENTLY CLOG VEIN AND ARTERY DEADEN NERVE AND DESTROY BRAIN HAD STILL TO DEVELOP ALL NIGHT LONG THE MARTIANS WERE HAMMERING AND STIRRING SLEEPLESS INDEFATIGABLE
OR RATHER HEADS ABOUT FOUR FEET IN DIAMETER EACH BODY HAVING IN FRONT OF IT A FACE THIS FACE HAD NO NOSTRILS
AN AGE OF ALMOST INTOLERABLE SUSPENSE INTERVENED THEN I HEARD IT FUMBLING AT THE LATCH
IF YOU WOULD HAVE HAD ONE HUMAN BEING OUTSIDE IT UNLESS IT WERE SOME RELATION OF STENT
OF THE ANIMAL SIDE OF THE ORGANISM BY THE INTELLIGENCE TO ME IT IS QUITE CREDIBLE THAT THE MARTIANS MAY BE DESCENDED FROM BEINGS
AND THAT THE TENDENCY OF NATURAL SELECTION WOULD LIE IN THE DIRECTION OF THEIR STEADY DIMINUTION THROUGH THE COMING AGES THE BRAIN ALONE REMAINED A CARDINAL NECESSITY ONLY ONE OTHER PART OF THE BODY HAD A STRONG CASE FOR SURVIVAL AND THAT WAS THE HAND
ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXTRAORDINARY GLITTERING MECHANISM I SAW BUSY IN THE EXCAVATION
HENDERSON OGILVY AND THE OTHERS BUT THERE WAS LITTLE I DIDN'T KNOW
OR HAS PREFERRED OTHER EXPEDIENTS TO ITS DEVELOPMENT AND NOT ONLY DID THE MARTIANS EITHER NOT KNOW OF WHICH IS INCREDIBLE OR ABSTAIN FROM THE WHEEL BUT IN THEIR APPARATUS SINGULARLY LITTLE USE IS MADE OF THE FIXED PIVOT OR RELATIVELY FIXED PIVOT WITH CIRCULAR MOTIONS THEREABOUT CONFINED
SOMETHING OF MY SCHOOLBOY DREAMS OF BATTLE AND HEROISM CAME BACK
IN THE TRIANGLE OF BRIGHT OUTER SUNLIGHT I SAW THE MARTIAN IN ITS BRIAREUS OF A HANDLING MACHINE SCRUTINIZING THE CURATE'S HEAD
SHOT WITH THREADS OF RED FIRE WERE DRIVING UP INTO THE STILL AIR AND THROWING DARK SHADOWS UPON THE GREEN TREETOPS EASTWARD THE SMOKE ALREADY EXTENDED FAR AWAY TO THE EAST AND WEST TO THE BYFLEET PINE WOODS EASTWARD
THE MARTIANS UNDERSTOOD DOORS IT WORRIED AT THE CATCH FOR A MINUTE PERHAPS AND THEN THE DOOR OPENED IN THE DARKNESS I COULD JUST SEE THE THING LIKE AN ELEPHANT'S TRUNK MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
IT WAS ONLY ABOUT FIVE HOWEVER
TILLIE HAD STAYED AT HOME TO GET SUPPER THEA GOT UP WASHED HER HOT FACE AND ARMS AND PUT ON THE WHITE ORGANDIE DRESS SHE HAD WORN LAST NIGHT IT WAS GETTING TOO SMALL FOR HER AND SHE MIGHT AS WELL WEAR IT OUT
SHE THOUGHT THEM NICE BOYS AND TRIED TO MAKE THEM GET THEIR LESSONS SHE ONCE FOUGHT A BULLY WHO PICKED ON AXEL AT SCHOOL SHE NEVER MADE FUN OF ANNA'S CRIMPINGS AND CURLINGS AND BEAUTY RITES
SHE FOUND LATER THAT IT WAS THE PROPERTY OF ONE OF RAMAS'S YOUNG COUSINS WHO WAS TAKING IT TO UTAH WITH HIM TO CHEER HIM AT HIS JOB A THE MEXICANS NEVER WAIT UNTIL IT IS DARK TO BEGIN TO DANCE
AFTER SHE WAS DRESSED SHE UNLOCKED HER DOOR AND WENT CAUTIOUSLY DOWNSTAIRS SHE FELT AS IF CHILLING HOSTILITIES MIGHT BE AWAITING HER IN THE TRUNK LOFT ON THE STAIRWAY ALMOST ANYWHERE
AS IF THEY CAME FROM ICE THAT MELTED SLOWLY SHE WAS NOT READY TO LEAVE HER LITTLE SHELL SHE WAS BEING PULLED OUT TOO SOON SHE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO THINK ANYWHERE ELSE AS WELL AS HERE SHE WOULD NEVER SLEEP SO WELL
WASN'T IT NICE OF HIM TO REMEMBER SHE TOOK FROM HER POCKET A POSTCARD BENT IN THE MIDDLE AND FOLDED AND HANDED IT TO RAY ON IT WAS A WHITE DOVE PERCHED ON A WREATH OF VERY BLUE FORGET ME NOTS
THERE WAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF EASE AND FRIENDLY PLEASURE IN THE LOW DIMLY LIT ROOM AND THEA COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHETHER THE MEXICANS HAD NO JEALOUSIES OR NEIGHBORLY GRUDGES AS THE PEOPLE IN MOONSTONE HAD
SHE LAY STILL UNTIL SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER THEN SHE WAKENED FRITZ AND THEY WENT OVER TO THE WINDOW AND LEANED OUT THEY COULD HEAR CLEARLY THERE
THEA WENT SLOWLY UP THE BACK STAIRS TO HER LOFT HER LEGS SEEMED AS HEAVY AS LEAD AS SHE CLIMBED THE STAIRS AND SHE FELT AS IF EVERYTHING INSIDE HER HAD SOLIDIFIED AND GROWN HARD
PLENTY MORE A PARAISO MAY BEE HE RETORTED WHEN THEY WERE NOT DANCING WITH HER THEIR EYES FOLLOWED HER OVER THE COIFFURES OF THEIR OTHER PARTNERS THAT WAS NOT DIFFICULT
THAT SHE PUT UP WITH A GREAT MANY LITTLE ANNOYANCES AND THAT HER DUTIES AS A TEACHER SEPARATED HER MORE THAN EVER FROM THE BOYS AND GIRLS OF HER OWN AGE HE DID EVERYTHING HE COULD TO PROVIDE RECREATION FOR HER
ONE OF HER MISTAKES WAS TO LET HERSELF IN FOR A CALLING DOWN FROM MISSUS LIVERY JOHNSON THAT LADY APPEARED AT THE KRONBORGS ONE MORNING AND ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD ALLOW NO GIRL TO STAMP HER FOOT AT HER DAUGHTER GRACE
FROM DENVER AND KEPT HIS EYES AND EARS OPEN FOR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT INTEREST HER HE WAS OF COURSE LIVING FOR THEA HE HAD THOUGHT IT ALL OUT CAREFULLY AND HAD MADE UP HIS MIND
JOHNNY APPROACHED THEA HIS GUITAR UNDER HIS ARM AND THE ELDER RAMAS BOY POLITELY GAVE UP HIS PLACE JOHNNY SAT DOWN TOOK A LONG BREATH STRUCK A FIERCE CHORD AND THEN HUSHED IT WITH HIS OTHER HAND
IF A PUPIL DID NOT GET ON WELL SHE FUMED AND FRETTED SHE COUNTED UNTIL SHE WAS HOARSE SHE LISTENED TO SCALES IN HER SLEEP WUNSCH HAD TAUGHT ONLY ONE PUPIL SERIOUSLY BUT THEA TAUGHT
KANSAS HE HAS MY SYMPATHY WHY IS THAT A POOR TOWN IT'S THE JUMPING OFF PLACE NO TOWN AT ALL SOME HOUSES DUMPED DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF A CORNFIELD
LIKE A YELLOW BUTTERFLY SOARING ABOVE A SWARM OF DARK ONES AH SAID MISSUS KOHLER SOFTLY
I WOULDN'T STAY THERE OVER SUNDAY FOR A TEN DOLLAR BILL OH DEAR WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HE'S DOING THERE MAYBE HE JUST STOPPED OFF THERE A FEW DAYS TO TUNE PIANOS THEA SUGGESTED HOPEFULLY
AND THE DULL RED OF HIS SUNBURNED FACE SOMEHOW SEEMED RIGHT IN THE LIGHT AND WIND HE LOOKED BETTER TOO WITH HIS HAT ON HIS HAIR WAS THIN AND DRY WITH NO PARTICULAR COLOR OR CHARACTER
NEVER SUGGESTED THAT SHE MIGHT BE MORE INTIMATELY CONFIDENTIAL WITH HIM OR TALKED TO HER OF THE THING HE THOUGHT ABOUT SO CONSTANTLY HE HAD THE CHIVALRY WHICH IS PERHAPS THE PROUDEST POSSESSION OF HIS RACE
SHE HERSELF WOULD DECIDE WHAT PIECES GRACE SHOULD STUDY THEA READILY CONSENTED TO THAT AND MISSUS JOHNSON RUSTLED AWAY TO TELL A NEIGHBOR WOMAN THAT THEA KRONBORG COULD BE MEEK ENOUGH WHEN YOU WENT AT HER RIGHT
BUT SHE WAS LOOKING OFF INTENTLY INTO THE MIRAGE AT ONE OF THOSE MAMMOTH CATTLE THAT ARE NEARLY ALWAYS REFLECTED THERE DO YOU FIND IT EASIER TO TEACH IN YOUR NEW ROOM HE ASKED YES I'M NOT INTERRUPTED SO MUCH
REGULAR WILLY BOY HAIR AS HE HIMSELF DESCRIBED IT
WE MUST STOP ON OUR WAY BACK AND SHOW THIS CARD TO MISSUS KOHLER SHE MISSES HIM SO BY THE WAY THEE
HE OBJECTED WITH POLITE PERSISTENCE HOW YOU ACCOMPANY WITH PIANO OH THAT WILL BE EASY ENOUGH FOR YOU MAY BEE JOHNNY SMILED AND DRUMMED ON THE TABLE WITH THE TIPS OF HIS AGILE BROWN FINGERS
ONE OF THE GIRLS WAS PLAYING ON JOHNNY'S GUITAR ANOTHER WAS PICKING LIGHTLY AT A MANDOLIN THE MOONLIGHT WAS SO BRIGHT THAT ONE COULD SEE EVERY GLANCE AND SMILE AND THE FLASH OF THEIR TEETH
THERE'S NO GENERAL DISSATISFACTION AMONG YOUR SCHOLARS SHE JUST WANTED TO GET IN A KNOCK
AND THE SOPRANO FINISHES ALONE WHEN THE SOPRANO'S LAST NOTE DIED AWAY FRITZ NODDED TO HIS WIFE JA HE SAID SCHON
AND HER FARM DON'T BRING HER IN ANYTHING TAKES ALL THE TENANT CAN RAISE TO PAY THE TAXES DON'T LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT YOU PROMISED TO TELL ME ABOUT THE PLAY YOU WENT TO SEE IN DENVER
THEA REMEMBERED THE OLD STORIES ABOUT HIS SPELLS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM WHEN HIS MADNESS WAS ON HIM BUT SHE FELT SOMETHING TONIGHT AT HER ELBOW THAT GAVE HER AN IDEA OF WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE
NOT THIS NIGHT SENORITA HE PLEADED SOFTLY NOT THIS NIGHT HE DROPPED BACK AGAIN AND LAY WITH HIS CHEEK ON HIS RIGHT ARM THE HAND LYING PASSIVE ON THE SAND ABOVE HIS HEAD
AND ALWAYS IN A COMMISERATING TONE AS IF HE HAD MET WITH SOME MISFORTUNE MISTER KRONBORG QUITE INNOCENT OF HER INTENTIONS REPLIED KINDLY AND ABSENT MINDEDLY AFTER THE DESSERT
IN THE CITY OF MEXICO THEY AIN'T A SIT LIKE STUMPS WHEN THEY HEAR THAT NOT A MUCH WHEN THEY LIKE
SHE COULD HEAR THE SCRAPING OF VIOLINS BEING TUNED THE TINKLE OF MANDOLINS AND THE GROWL OF A DOUBLE BASS WHERE HAD THEY GOT A DOUBLE BASS SHE DID NOT KNOW THERE WAS ONE IN MOONSTONE
BY THIS TIME SHE WAS AS WHITE AS THE SUNDAY TABLECLOTH WELL SHE REPLIED IN A COLD EVEN TONE I'LL HAVE TO THROW IT AT THEM SOONER OR LATER IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WHEN
THAT'S ALWAYS THE NIGHT ANNA CHOOSES TO GO TO BED EARLY IT'S A DARNED SHAME THEE YOU DIDN'T COP THAT ROOM FOR YOURSELF I'M SORE AT THE PADRE ABOUT THAT HE OUGHT TO GIVE YOU THAT ROOM
MEANWHILE IT WAS PLEASURE ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT SHE DEPENDED ON HIM MORE AND MORE THAT SHE LEANED UPON HIS STEADY KINDNESS HE NEVER BROKE FAITH WITH HIMSELF ABOUT HER HE NEVER HINTED TO HER OF HIS HOPES FOR THE FUTURE
BESIDES UP THERE I AM AWAY FROM EVERYBODY AND I CAN READ AS LATE AS I PLEASE AND NOBODY NAGS ME A GROWING GIRL NEEDS LOTS OF SLEEP RAY PROVIDENTLY REMARKED
ANNA AND HER FATHER IN THE LEAD ANNA SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN ON A VERY STORY BOOK ATTITUDE TOWARD HER FATHER PATRONIZING AND CONDESCENDING IT SEEMED TO THEA THE OLDER BOYS WERE NOT IN THE FAMILY BAND
IN THE EVENING WHEN THE MEN ARE SINGING THEIR THROATS DRY ON THE DOORSTEP OR AROUND THE CAMP FIRE BESIDE THE WORK TRAIN THE WOMEN USUALLY SIT AND COMB THEIR HAIR
EXCEPT THAT IT WAS A LITTLE LONGER AND WAS SO UNPRETENTIOUS THAT NOBODY IN MOONSTONE KNEW OF ITS EXISTENCE THE SPANISH BOYS ARE RETICENT ABOUT THEIR OWN AFFAIRS
AIN'T YOU LEARNED HOW TO EAT YET CHILDREN CHILDREN SAID MISTER KRONBORG NERVOUSLY LOOKING UP FROM THE CHICKEN HE WAS DISMEMBERING HE GLANCED AT HIS WIFE WHOM HE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN HARMONY IN THE FAMILY
WHEN SHE WENT AWAY FROM IT FOR GOOD SHE WOULD LEAVE SOMETHING THAT SHE COULD NEVER RECOVER MEMORIES OF PLEASANT EXCITEMENT OF HAPPY ADVENTURES IN HER MIND OF WARM SLEEP ON HOWLING WINTER NIGHTS
IF SHE THOUGHT BEST BY THAT TIME HE WOULD SURELY HAVE GOT IN ON SOMETHING COPPER OIL GOLD SILVER SHEEP SOMETHING
THE OTHERS MIGHT BE ANYBODY OVER THERE JUST MEXICAN VOICES THEN AT THE APPOINTED AT THE ACUTE MOMENT THE SOPRANO VOICE LIKE A FOUNTAIN JET
THEA KEPT GLANCING DOWN AT HIM AS HE LAY THERE ON HIS ELBOW HIS EYES SEEMED TWICE AS LARGE AS USUAL AND HAD LIGHTS IN THEM LIKE THOSE THE MOONLIGHT MAKES ON BLACK RUNNING WATER
BUT I HAVE TO RAY THEY'RE ALL SO DUMB THEY'VE GOT NO AMBITION THEA EXCLAIMED IRRITABLY JENNY SMILEY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO ISN'T STUPID SHE CAN READ PRETTY WELL
THEA MADE A FEEBLE SUGGESTION THAT HER MOTHER MIGHT GO WITH HER BUT MISSUS KRONBORG WAS TOO WISE FOR THAT SHE KNEW THAT THEA WOULD HAVE A BETTER TIME IF SHE WENT ALONE
THEY WERE DRESSED ALIKE IN BLACK VELVET JACKETS AND SOFT SILK SHIRTS WITH OPAL SHIRT BUTTONS AND FLOWING BLACK TIES LOOPED THROUGH GOLD RINGS
YOU COME TO MY HOUSE ONE DAY BOUT NOON LIKE THIS AND I WAS IN THE DOOR PLAYING GUITAR YOU WAS BAREHEAD BAREFOOT YOU RUN AWAY FROM HOME YOU STAND THERE AND MAKE A FROWN AT ME AN LISTEN
WHERE THEY BEAT A TRIUMPH IN HER THE ROOM WAS HOT AS AN OVEN THE SUN WAS BEATING FIERCELY ON THE SHINGLES BEHIND THE BOARD CEILING SHE UNDRESSED AND BEFORE SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HER BED IN HER CHEMISE
WHEN SHE SAT OUT A DANCE WITH THEM THEY TALKED TO HER ABOUT THEIR FAMILY AT HOME AND TOLD HER HOW THEIR MOTHER HAD ONCE PUNNED UPON THEIR NAME RAMA IN SPANISH MEANT A BRANCH THEY EXPLAINED
THEY ARE A USEFUL PEOPLE NOW YOU CAN JUST TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE CONVERSATION HOWEVER DID NOT FLOURISH AT THAT DINNER EVERYBODY ATE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE CHARLEY AND GUS SAID
AND INTRODUCED HER BROTHER WITH WHOM SHE HAD JUST BEEN DANCING YOU BETTER TAKE HIM EVERY TIME HE ASKS YOU SHE WHISPERED HE'S THE BEST DANCER HERE EXCEPT JOHNNY
THAT'S WHAT THEY LIKE I'LL NEVER HAVE MONEY ENOUGH TO GO TO CHICAGO MOTHER MEANT TO LEND ME SOME I THINK BUT NOW THEY'VE GOT HARD TIMES BACK IN NEBRASKA
THEIR AMBITIONS AND SACRED PROPRIETIES WERE MEANINGLESS TO HER SHE HAD NEGLECTED TO CONGRATULATE CHARLEY UPON HAVING BEEN PROMOTED FROM THE GROCERY DEPARTMENT OF COMMINGS'S STORE TO THE DRYGOODS DEPARTMENT
AND GO TO CHICAGO AND TAKE SOME LESSONS
SHE COME FOR HEAR GUITAR SHE GOTTA SOME MUSIC IN HER THAT CHILD WHERE SHE GET THEN HE TELL ME BOUT YOUR GRAN'PAPA PLAY OBOE IN THE OLD COUNTRY
TO BELIEVE THAT THOUGH THEY HAD NO PARTICULAR ENDOWMENTS THEY WERE OF HER KIND AND NOT OF THE MOONSTONE KIND NOW THEY HAD ALL GROWN UP AND BECOME PERSONS
WE HAVE NO ALTO BUT ALL THE GIRLS CAN SING ALTO AND MAKE SOME NOISE THE WOMEN LAUGHED MEXICAN WOMEN OF THE POORER CLASS DO NOT SING LIKE THE MEN PERHAPS THEY ARE TOO INDOLENT
JOHNNY RAN HIS FINGERS THROUGH HIS CURLY BLACK HAIR IF YOU WISH I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT SERENATA ALL RIGHT FOR YOUNG LADIES DOWN THERE IT IS MORE FOR MARRIED LADIES
UNINQUIRING HE RESTED THEA BECAUSE HE WAS SO DIFFERENT BECAUSE THOUGH HE OFTEN TOLD HER INTERESTING THINGS HE NEVER SET LIVELY FANCIES GOING IN HER HEAD BECAUSE HE NEVER MISUNDERSTOOD HER
TWENTY THE DULLER THEY WERE THE MORE FURIOUSLY SHE POKED AND PRODDED THEM WITH THE LITTLE GIRLS SHE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS PATIENT BUT WITH PUPILS OLDER THAN HERSELF SHE SOMETIMES LOST HER TEMPER
AND SHE WATCHED HER DAUGHTER GO OUT OF THE GATE AND DOWN THE SIDEWALK THAT LED TO THE DEPOT THEA WALKED SLOWLY IT WAS A SOFT ROSY EVENING THE SAND HILLS WERE LAVENDER THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN A GLOWING COPPER DISK
THE DANCERS SANG IT SOFTLY AS THEY MOVED THERE WERE THREE LITTLE GIRLS UNDER TWELVE IN THEIR FIRST COMMUNION DRESSES AND ONE OF THEM HAD AN ORANGE MARIGOLD IN HER BLACK HAIR JUST OVER HER EAR THEY DANCED WITH THE MEN AND WITH EACH OTHER
AFTER SHUTTING HER DOOR AND LOCKING IT SHE SAT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF HER BED THIS PLACE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER REFUGE BUT THERE WAS A HOSTILITY IN THE HOUSE NOW WHICH THIS DOOR COULD NOT SHUT OUT
JOHNNY'S REEDY TENOR THEY KNEW WELL
MISSUS KRONBORG HAD SAID THAT THEA WAS NOT TO BE DISTURBED ON SUNDAY MORNING AND SHE SLEPT UNTIL NOON WHEN SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS THE FAMILY WERE JUST SITTING DOWN TO DINNER
MEXICAN TOWN HAD BEEN INCREASED BY HALF A DOZEN NEW FAMILIES DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THE MEXICANS HAD PUT UP AN ADOBE DANCE HALL THAT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE ONE OF THEIR OWN DWELLINGS
HE BEGAN TO PUT OUT THE LIGHTS AND MISSUS TELLAMANTEZ LED THE WAY ACROSS THE SQUARE TO HER CASA THE RAMAS BROTHERS ESCORTED THEA AND AS THEY STEPPED OUT OF THE DOOR SILVO EXCLAIMED
HE SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND WHILE THEA LOOKED OVER HIS ARM BEGAN TO WRITE THE SONG DOWN IN A LONG SLANTING SCRIPT WITH HIGHLY ORNAMENTAL CAPITALS
ACROSS THE GULCH THE KOHLERS LITTLE HOUSE SLEPT AMONG ITS TREES A DARK SPOT ON THE WHITE FACE OF THE DESERT THE WINDOWS OF THEIR UPSTAIRS BEDROOM WERE OPEN
AND SHE HAS SUCH GOOD HANDS BUT SHE DON'T CARE A RAP ABOUT IT SHE HAS NO PRIDE RAY'S FACE WAS FULL OF COMPLACENT SATISFACTION AS HE GLANCED SIDEWISE AT THEA
THE FATHERS ALWAYS DANCED AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH THEIR LITTLE DAUGHTERS AS WELL AS WITH THEIR WIVES ONE OF THE GIRLS CAME UP TO GREET THEA HER DARK CHEEKS GLOWING WITH PLEASURE AND CORDIALITY
I NEVER FORGETTA THAT TIME JOHNNY CHUCKLED SOFTLY THEA NODDED I REMEMBER THAT DAY TOO I LIKED YOUR MUSIC BETTER THAN THE CHURCH MUSIC WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A DANCE OVER THERE JOHNNY
ONCE WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE LADS THEIR MOTHER TOOK THEM ALONG WHEN SHE WENT TO HELP THE WOMEN DECORATE THE CHURCH FOR EASTER SOME ONE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE HAD BROUGHT ANY FLOWERS AND SHE REPLIED THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT HER RAMAS
THE MOONFLOWERS OVER MISSUS TELLAMANTEZ'S DOOR WERE WIDE OPEN AND OF AN UNEARTHLY WHITE THE MOON ITSELF LOOKED LIKE A GREAT PALE FLOWER IN THE SKY AFTER ALL THE ICE CREAM WAS GONE
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE MEXICANS SHE ASKED FLUSHING THEY DON'T TROUBLE ANYBODY AND THEY ARE KIND TO THEIR FAMILIES AND HAVE GOOD MANNERS NICE CLEAN PEOPLE GOT SOME STYLE ABOUT THEM
THERE WAS NO CONSTRAINT OF ANY KIND THERE TO NIGHT BUT A KIND OF NATURAL HARMONY ABOUT THEIR MOVEMENTS THEIR GREETINGS THEIR LOW CONVERSATION THEIR SMILES RAMAS BROUGHT UP HIS TWO YOUNG COUSINS
HOW DOES HE FLATTEN HIMSELF INTO THE GROUND LIKE THAT THEA ASKED HERSELF I WISH I KNEW IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE SOMEHOW
ONE BLONDE HEAD MOVING AMONG SO MANY DARK ONES THEA HAD NOT MEANT TO DANCE MUCH BUT THE RAMAS BOYS DANCED SO WELL AND WERE SO HANDSOME AND ADORING THAT SHE YIELDED TO THEIR ENTREATIES
MISSUS KRONBORG SMILED SHE NOTICED THAT THEA HAD PUT ON A WHITE DRESS AND HAD DONE HER HAIR UP WITH UNUSUAL CARE AND THAT SHE CARRIED HER BEST BLUE SCARF
THIS MEXICAN DANCE WAS SOFT AND QUIET THERE WAS NO CALLING THE CONVERSATION WAS VERY LOW THE RHYTHM OF THE MUSIC WAS SMOOTH AND ENGAGING THE MEN WERE GRACEFUL AND COURTEOUS
THEA MOVED RESTLESSLY ON THE BUGGY CUSHIONS THEY NEED OTHER THINGS MORE SHE MUTTERED OH I FORGOT I BROUGHT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU LOOK HERE IT CAME ON MY BIRTHDAY
AND EVERYBODY DOWN THERE IS MUSICAL HE COULD ALWAYS GET A JOB PLAYING IN SALOONS IF HE WAS DEAD BROKE I'VE FIGURED OUT THAT I'VE GOT NO YEARS OF MY LIFE TO WASTE IN A METHODIST COUNTRY WHERE THEY RAISE PORK
SHE ADDED THAT THEA'S BAD MANNERS WITH THE OLDER GIRLS WERE BEING TALKED ABOUT ALL OVER TOWN AND THAT IF HER TEMPER DID NOT SPEEDILY IMPROVE SHE WOULD LOSE ALL HER ADVANCED PUPILS
YOU KNOW SOMETHING LISTEN I TELL YOU HE ROSE AND SAT DOWN ON THE TABLE BESIDE HER PUTTING HIS FOOT ON THE CHAIR HE LOVED TO TALK AT THE HOUR OF NOON WHEN YOU WAS A LITTLE GIRL NO BIGGER THAN THAT
PRESENTLY HE LOOKED UP THIS A SONG NOT EXACTLY MEXICAN HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY IT COME FROM FARTHER DOWN BRAZIL VENEZUELA MAY BEE
AND THEY HAVE A PERFECT RIGHT TO THEIR OWN WAYS OF COURSE I LIKE EM I DON'T PRETEND THINGS EVERYBODY ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN TASTE REMARKED CHARLEY BITTERLY QUIT CRUMBING YOUR BREAD UP THOR
SHE HAD SUNG FOR CHURCHES AND FUNERALS AND TEACHERS BUT SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE SUNG FOR A REALLY MUSICAL PEOPLE AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD EVER FELT THE RESPONSE THAT SUCH A PEOPLE CAN GIVE
HER MOTHER WAS ALL RIGHT
HE HAD NEVER EMBARRASSED HER BY SO MUCH AS A GLANCE SOMETIMES WHEN THEY DROVE OUT TO THE SAND HILLS HE LET HIS LEFT ARM LIE ALONG THE BACK OF THE BUGGY SEAT BUT IT NEVER CAME ANY NEARER TO THEA THAN THAT NEVER TOUCHED HER
ANNA'S MOUTH AND EYEBROWS BECAME HALF MOONS THEA LOOKED ACROSS THE TABLE AT THE UNCOMPROMISING COUNTENANCES OF HER OLDER BROTHERS WHY
JOHNNY SHE SAID SUDDENLY I WANT YOU TO WRITE DOWN THE WORDS OF THAT MEXICAN SERENADE YOU USED TO SING YOU KNOW ROSA DE NOCHE IT'S AN UNUSUAL SONG I'M GOING TO STUDY IT
I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD SHOW MORE CONSIDERATION FOR FATHER'S POSITION THEA ANNA BEGAN AS SOON AS SHE AND HER SISTER WERE ALONE THEA GAVE HER A SIDELONG GLANCE WHY WHAT HAVE I DONE TO FATHER
AND THE BOYS WERE STRUNG ALONG ON EITHER SIDE OF THE TABLE THERE WAS A PLACE LEFT FOR THEA BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND THOR DURING THE SILENCE WHICH PRECEDED THE BLESSING THEA FELT SOMETHING UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE AIR
HIS VOICE WAS THIN UNSTEADY HUSKY IN THE MIDDLE TONES BUT IT WAS DISTINCTLY A VOICE AND SOMETIMES HE MANAGED TO GET SOMETHING VERY SWEET OUT OF IT CERTAINLY IT MADE HIM HAPPY TO SING
THERE WERE THREE VERSES OF THE SONG IN ALL AND WHEN JOHNNY HAD WRITTEN THEM DOWN HE SAT LOOKING AT THEM MEDITATIVELY HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE I DON THINK FOR A HIGH VOICE SENORITA
THEY'LL ALWAYS GO FOR ME JUST AS THEY DID FOR WUNSCH IT WASN'T BECAUSE HE DRANK THEY WENT FOR HIM NOT REALLY IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE
AND JOYOUS AWAKENINGS ON SUMMER MORNINGS THERE WERE CERTAIN DREAMS THAT MIGHT REFUSE TO COME TO HER AT ALL EXCEPT IN A LITTLE MORNING CAVE FACING THE SUN WHERE THEY CAME TO HER SO POWERFULLY
SHE COULD GO TO SPANISH JOHNNY'S AND SING PART SONGS WITH THE MEXICANS AND NOBODY OBJECTED THEA WAS STILL UNDER THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF TEACHING AND WAS TERRIBLY IN EARNEST ABOUT IT
AND BIRTHDAY GREETINGS IN GOLD LETTERS UNDER THIS WAS WRITTEN FROM A WUNSCH RAY TURNED THE CARD OVER EXAMINED THE POSTMARK AND THEN BEGAN TO LAUGH CONCORD
THE YOUTHS LAY DOWN ON THE SHINING GRAVEL BESIDE HER ONE ON HER RIGHT AND ONE ON HER LEFT JOHNNY ALREADY CALLED THEM LOS ACOLITOS THE ALTAR BOYS THE TALK ALL ABOUT THEM WAS LOW AND INDOLENT
I NEVER SEE A CHILD DO THAT OUTSIDE MEXICO YOU WAS OH I DO KNOW SEVEN YEAR MAY BEE BY N BY THE PREACHER COME LOOK FOR YOU AND BEGIN FOR SCOLD I SAY DON SCOLD MEESTER KRONBORG
FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE FULLY UNDERSTOOD THE CRYPTIC EXPLANATION THAT MISSUS TELLAMANTEZ HAD MADE TO DOCTOR ARCHIE LONG AGO THERE WERE THE SAME SHELLS ALONG THE WALK SHE BELIEVED SHE COULD PICK OUT THE VERY ONE
HE OFTEN TURNED TO HER A FACE FULL OF PRIDE AND FRANK ADMIRATION BUT HIS GLANCE WAS NEVER SO INTIMATE OR SO PENETRATING AS DOCTOR ARCHIE'S HIS BLUE EYES WERE CLEAR AND SHALLOW FRIENDLY
I EXPECT YOU HAD A GOOD TIME AT THAT DANCE THEA I HOPE YOU GOT YOUR SLEEP OUT HIGH SOCIETY THAT REMARKED CHARLEY GIVING THE MASHED POTATOES A VICIOUS SWAT
JOHNNY BOWED TO HER FROM THE PLATFORM AT THE END OF THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS PLAYING THE MANDOLIN ALONG WITH TWO FIDDLES AND THE BASS THE HALL WAS A LONG LOW ROOM WITH WHITEWASHED WALLS A FAIRLY TIGHT PLANK FLOOR
OH SHE WOULD MAKE THESE PEOPLE SORRY ENOUGH THERE WOULD COME A TIME WHEN THEY WOULD WANT TO MAKE IT UP WITH HER BUT NEVER AGAIN SHE HAD NO LITTLE VANITIES
WOODEN BENCHES ALONG THE SIDES AND A FEW BRACKET LAMPS SCREWED TO THE FRAME TIMBERS THERE MUST HAVE BEEN FIFTY PEOPLE THERE COUNTING THE CHILDREN THE MEXICAN DANCES WERE VERY MUCH FAMILY AFFAIRS
THIS WAS EVIDENTLY A CHERISHED FAMILY STORY WHEN IT WAS NEARLY MIDNIGHT
AND THE FLEECY CLOUDS IN THE EAST WERE A BURNING ROSE COLOR FLECKED WITH GOLD THEA PASSED THE COTTONWOOD GROVE AND THEN THE DEPOT WHERE SHE LEFT THE SIDEWALK AND TOOK THE SANDY PATH TOWARD MEXICAN TOWN
DO YOU REALLY LIKE THAT KIND THEA OR DO YOU JUST PRETEND TO THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW GUS LOOKED AT HER WITH PAINED INQUIRY BUT HE AT LEAST LOOKED AT HER THEY'RE JUST AS CLEAN AS WHITE PEOPLE
RAY GAVE HER BACK THE CARD HE'S HEADED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION WHAT DOES HE WANT TO GET BACK INTO A GRASS COUNTRY FOR NOW THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD LIVE TOWNS DOWN ON THE SANTA FE
OF COURSE WE ALL GET THE BLAME FOR IT ANYTHING DISGRACEFUL ABOUT SINGING THEA ASKED WITH A PROVOKING YAWN I MUST SAY YOU CHOOSE YOUR COMPANY YOU ALWAYS HAD THAT STREAK IN YOU THEA
SILVO DROPPED ON HIS BACK AND LAY LOOKING AT THE MOON UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS STILL LOOKING AT THEA WHEN SHE FINISHED THE FIRST VERSE THEA WHISPERED TO JOHNNY AGAIN I CAN DO IT BETTER THAN THAT
THEY TURNED THEMSELVES AND ALL THEY HAD OVER TO HER FOR THE MOMENT THEY CARED ABOUT NOTHING IN THE WORLD BUT WHAT SHE WAS DOING THEIR FACES CONFRONTED HER OPEN EAGER UNPROTECTED
COME FROM TORREON THEY GOING TO SALT LAKE FOR SOME JOB A AND STAY OFF WITH HIM TWO THREE DAYS AND HE MUS HAVE A PARTY YOU LIKE TO COME THAT WAS HOW THEA CAME TO GO TO THE MEXICAN BALL
IN AN INSTANT THESE THINGS SEEMED TO BE WITHIN HER INSTEAD OF WITHOUT AS IF THEY HAD COME FROM HER IN THE FIRST PLACE WHEN SHE FINISHED HER LISTENERS BROKE INTO EXCITED MURMUR
HE WENT TO TAKE HIS USUAL SUNDAY AFTERNOON NAP AND MISSUS KRONBORG CARRIED SOME DINNER TO A SICK NEIGHBOR THEA AND ANNA BEGAN TO CLEAR THE TABLE
I KNOW ENOUGH SPANISH FOR THAT JOHNNY LOOKED UP FROM HIS ROLLER WITH HIS BRIGHT AFFABLE SMILE SI BUT IT IS LOW FOR YOU I THINK
EVERYBODY AT SUNDAY SCHOOL WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU GOING OVER THERE AND SINGING WITH THE MEXICANS ALL NIGHT WHEN YOU WON'T SING FOR THE CHURCH SOMEBODY HEARD YOU AND TOLD IT ALL OVER TOWN
BY N BY YOU SAY FOR ME TO SING I SING SOME LIL TING AND THEN I SAY FOR YOU TO SING WITH ME YOU DON KNOW NO WORDS OF COURSE BUT YOU TAKE THE AIR AND YOU SING IT JUSTA BEAUTI FUL
THEY SING IT FOR HUSBANDS OR SOMEBODY ELSE MAY BEE JOHNNY'S EYES TWINKLED AND HE APOLOGIZED GRACEFULLY WITH HIS SHOULDERS
RAY KENNEDY USED TO KNOW ABOUT ALL THEIR LITTLE DOINGS BUT SINCE HIS DEATH THERE WAS NO ONE WHOM THE MEXICANS CONSIDERED SIMPATICO
YOU GET LOST IN THE CORN NOT EVEN A SALOON TO KEEP THINGS GOING SELL WHISKEY WITHOUT A LICENSE AT THE BUTCHER SHOP BEER ON ICE WITH THE LIVER AND BEEFSTEAK
THEA HAD ALWAYS TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED THAT HER SISTER AND BROTHERS RECOGNIZED THAT SHE HAD SPECIAL ABILITIES AND THAT THEY WERE PROUD OF IT SHE HAD DONE THEM THE HONOR SHE TOLD HERSELF BITTERLY
WHILE JOHNNY WAS GESTICULATING AND TELLING EVERYBODY WHAT TO SING AND HOW TO SING IT THEA PUT OUT HER FOOT AND TOUCHED THE CORPSE OF SILVO WITH THE TOE OF HER SLIPPER AREN'T YOU GOING TO SING SILVO SHE ASKED TEASINGLY
AND IT MIGHT AS WELL BE NOW AS ANY TIME SHE CARRIED THE TRAY BLINDLY INTO THE KITCHEN TILLIE WHO WAS ALWAYS LISTENING AND LOOKING OUT FOR HER TOOK THE DISHES FROM HER WITH A FURTIVE FRIGHTENED GLANCE AT HER STONY FACE
THAT'S ALL RIGHT CHARLEY DROP IT THERE SAID MISSUS KRONBORG NO USE SPOILING YOUR SUNDAY DINNER WITH RACE PREJUDICES THE MEXICANS SUIT ME AND THEA VERY WELL
TALENTED ANNA MADE THE WORD SOUND LIKE ESCAPING STEAM I SUPPOSE YOU THINK IT'S SMART TO COME HOME AND THROW THAT AT YOUR FAMILY THEA PICKED UP THE TRAY
AND WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TRAIN THEIR VISION UPON DISTANT OBJECTS RAY REALIZED THAT THEA'S LIFE WAS DULL AND EXACTING AND THAT SHE MISSED WUNSCH HE KNEW SHE WORKED HARD
I LEARN IT FROM SOME FELLOW DOWN THERE AND HE LEARN IT FROM ANOTHER FELLOW IT IS A MOST LIKE MEXICAN BUT NOT QUITE THEA DID NOT RELEASE HIM BUT POINTED TO THE PAPER
SOME OF THEM THEA HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN OUT OF THEIR WORKING CLOTHES SMEARED WITH GREASE FROM THE ROUND HOUSE OR CLAY FROM THE BRICKYARD SOMETIMES WHEN THE MUSIC HAPPENED TO BE A POPULAR MEXICAN WALTZ SONG
THEA SOON DECIDED THAT THE POOREST DANCER WAS HERSELF EVEN MISSUS TELLAMANTEZ WHO ALWAYS HELD HER SHOULDERS SO STIFFLY DANCED BETTER THAN SHE DID THE MUSICIANS DID NOT REMAIN LONG AT THEIR POST
SHE FROWNED AT HERSELF FOR A LONG WHILE IN HER LOOKING GLASS YES SHE AND IT MUST FIGHT IT OUT TOGETHER THE THING THAT LOOKED AT HER OUT OF HER OWN EYES WAS THE ONLY FRIEND SHE COULD COUNT ON
SHE FELT AS IF ALL THESE WARM BLOODED PEOPLE DEBOUCHED INTO HER MISSUS TELLAMANTEZ'S FATEFUL RESIGNATION JOHNNY'S MADNESS THE ADORATION OF THE BOY WHO LAY STILL IN THE SAND
JOHNNY TILTED HIS HEAD WELL SATURDAY NIGHT THE SPANISH BOYS HAVE A LIL PARTY SOME DANZA
AND ANY ONE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO WATCH HIS KIND FACE RAY LOOKED HIS BEST OUT OF DOORS WHEN HIS THICK RED HANDS WERE COVERED BY GLOVES
SHE FELT ALL THOSE DARK EYES FIX THEMSELVES UPON HER INTENTLY SHE COULD SEE THEM SHINE THE FACES CAME OUT OF THE SHADOW LIKE THE WHITE FLOWERS OVER THE DOOR
THE RAMAS BOYS THOUGHT THEA DAZZLINGLY BEAUTIFUL THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A SCANDINAVIAN GIRL BEFORE AND HER HAIR AND FAIR SKIN BEWITCHED THEM
JOHNNY DROPPED ON HIS ELBOW WIPING HIS FACE AND NECK AND HANDS WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF SENORITA HE PANTED IF YOU SING LIKE THAT ONCE IN THE CITY OF MEXICO THEY JUST A GO CRAZY
YOU COULD FIX IT UP SO PRETTY I DIDN'T WANT IT HONEST I DIDN'T FATHER WOULD HAVE LET ME HAVE IT I LIKE MY OWN ROOM BETTER SOMEHOW I CAN THINK BETTER IN A LITTLE ROOM
THE MEN BEGAN HUNTING FEVERISHLY FOR CIGARETTES FAMOS SERRANOS THE BARYTONE BRICKLAYER TOUCHED JOHNNY'S ARM GAVE HIM A QUESTIONING LOOK THEN HEAVED A DEEP SIGH
ANY ONE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HEAR RAY'S SIMPLE AND CLEAR ACCOUNT OF THE PERFORMANCE HE HAD SEEN AT THE TABOR GRAND OPERA HOUSE MAGGIE MITCHELL IN LITTLE BAREFOOT
JUST WHEN HE WOULD SPEAK TO HER WHEN SHE WAS SEVENTEEN THEN HE WOULD TELL HER HIS PLAN AND ASK HER TO MARRY HIM HE WOULD BE WILLING TO WAIT TWO OR EVEN THREE YEARS UNTIL SHE WAS TWENTY
WHEN THEY WERE ALL SLEEPING AND DRESSING TOGETHER LIKE LITTLE CUBS AND BREAKFASTING IN THE KITCHEN SHE HAD LED AN ABSORBING PERSONAL LIFE OF HER OWN BUT SHE HAD A CUB LOYALTY TO THE OTHER CUBS
AND THEA HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE NEW HALL BECAUSE EVERY OTHER HOUSE IN THE TOWN WAS DESERTED EVEN THE BABIES HAD GONE TO THE BALL A NEIGHBOR WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO HOLD THE BABY WHILE THE MOTHER DANCED
THEA WAS FRIGHTENED SHE FELT SHE COULD NEVER BEAR THE DISGRACE IF SUCH A THING HAPPENED BESIDES WHAT WOULD HER FATHER SAY AFTER HE HAD GONE TO THE EXPENSE OF BUILDING AN ADDITION TO THE HOUSE
OR HAVE SUCH DREAMS IN ANY OTHER BED EVEN LAST NIGHT SUCH SWEET BREATHLESS DREAMS THEA HID HER FACE IN THE PILLOW WHEREVER SHE WENT SHE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT LITTLE BED WITH HER
WHITE AND GOLD LIKE EASTER THEY EXCLAIMED TO EACH OTHER
THEA PUT DOWN A TRAY FULL OF DISHES WELL I LIKE TO SING OVER THERE AND I DON'T LIKE TO OVER HERE I'LL SING FOR THEM ANY TIME THEY ASK ME TO THEY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING
ANNA AND HER OLDER BROTHERS HAD LOWERED THEIR EYES WHEN SHE CAME IN MISSUS KRONBORG NODDED CHEERFULLY AND AFTER THE BLESSING AS SHE BEGAN TO POUR THE COFFEE TURNED TO HER
WHISPERED MISSUS KOHLER IT MUST BE ACH WUNDERSCHON FRITZ WAS NOT SO WIDE AWAKE AS HIS WIFE HE GRUNTED AND SCRATCHED ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS BARE FOOT
THERE WAS THE SAME MOON UP YONDER AND PANTING AT HER ELBOW WAS THE SAME JOHNNY FOOLED BY THE SAME OLD THINGS WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED FAMOS THE BARYTONE MURMURED SOMETHING TO JOHNNY WHO REPLIED
NONSENSE I CAN DO MORE WITH MY LOW VOICE THAN I USED TO I'LL SHOW YOU SIT DOWN AND WRITE IT OUT FOR ME PLEASE THEA BECKONED HIM WITH THE SHORT YELLOW PENCIL TIED TO HIS ORDER BOOK
HER MOTHER HAD REPROVED HER FOR THIS OMISSION AND HOW WAS SHE TO KNOW THEA ASKED HERSELF THAT ANNA EXPECTED TO BE TEASED BECAUSE BERT RICE NOW CAME AND SAT IN THE HAMMOCK WITH HER EVERY NIGHT
I TALKED TO THE PIANO TUNER THE LAST TIME HE WAS HERE AND HE SAID ALL THE PEOPLE HE TUNED FOR EXPRESSED THEMSELVES VERY FAVORABLY ABOUT YOUR TEACHING I WISH YOU DIDN'T TAKE SO MUCH PAINS WITH THEM MYSELF
FRITZ TELLS ME HE HAS TO WAIT TILL TWO O'CLOCK FOR HIS SUNDAY DINNER THESE DAYS THE CHURCH PEOPLE OUGHT TO GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR THAT WHEN THEY GO FOR YOU THEA SHOOK HER HEAD AND SPOKE IN A TONE OF RESIGNATION
THE ELDER WAS MORE CRAFTY HE ASKED MIGUEL RAMAS WHETHER THERE WOULD BE PLENTY MORE GIRLS LIKE THAT A SALT LAKE MAYBEE SILVO OVERHEARING GAVE HIS BROTHER A CONTEMPTUOUS GLANCE
IN THE NATURE OF THINGS HER MOTHER HAD TO BE ON BOTH SIDES THEA FELT THAT SHE HAD BEEN BETRAYED A TRUCE HAD BEEN BROKEN BEHIND HER BACK SHE HAD NEVER HAD MUCH INDIVIDUAL AFFECTION FOR ANY OF HER BROTHERS EXCEPT THOR
THEY HAD CHARMING MANNERS AND LOW GUITAR LIKE VOICES THEY KNEW ALMOST NO ENGLISH BUT A MEXICAN BOY CAN PAY A GREAT MANY COMPLIMENTS WITH A VERY LIMITED VOCABULARY
BUT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN DISLOYAL NEVER FELT SCORN OR HELD GRUDGES AS A LITTLE GIRL SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN GOOD FRIENDS WITH GUNNER AND AXEL WHENEVER SHE HAD TIME TO PLAY EVEN BEFORE SHE GOT HER OWN ROOM
THEY HAD ENGAGEMENTS AND LEFT THE TABLE AS SOON AS THEY FINISHED THEIR APPLE PIE ANNA SAT PRIMLY AND ATE WITH GREAT ELEGANCE WHEN SHE SPOKE AT ALL SHE SPOKE TO HER FATHER ABOUT CHURCH MATTERS
NO IT WAS ALL CLEAR ENOUGH NOTHING THAT SHE WOULD EVER DO IN THE WORLD WOULD SEEM IMPORTANT TO THEM AND NOTHING THEY WOULD EVER DO WOULD SEEM IMPORTANT TO HER THEA LAY THINKING INTENTLY ALL THROUGH THE STIFLING AFTERNOON
NOW WE HAVE SOME LIL SERENATA EH YOU WAN A TRY WHEN THEA BEGAN TO SING INSTANT SILENCE FELL UPON THE COMPANY
MOST OF THE COMPANY FOLLOWED MISSUS TELLAMANTEZ AND THEY SAT ABOUT ON THE GRAVEL IN HER LITTLE YARD WHILE SHE AND JOHNNY AND MISSUS MIGUEL RAMAS SERVED THE ICE CREAM
AGAIN THAT SUDDEN SENSATION OF STARTLING SWEETNESS THRILLED HER SHE WAS SECRETLY VASTLY PLEASED AT ANNE'S IMPULSIVE CARESS WHICH WAS PROBABLY THE REASON WHY SHE SAID BRUSQUELY THERE THERE NEVER MIND YOUR KISSING NONSENSE
BUT I'M AFRAID THAT IS AN UNCHARITABLE SPEECH MISSUS ALLAN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER MAKE UNCHARITABLE SPEECHES BUT THEY DO SLIP OUT SO OFTEN BEFORE YOU THINK DON'T THEY I SIMPLY CAN'T TALK ABOUT JOSIE PYE
AND WALKED OFF TO THE DAIRY WITH THE PAILS
GOOD AFTERNOON MISSUS BLEWETT WE WERE JUST SAYING HOW FORTUNATE
I GUESS ONCE IS ENOUGH TO SAY THEM
WHEN WE FIND OUR INTEREST IN LIFE RETURNING TO US I WAS DOWN TO THE GRAVEYARD TO PLANT A ROSEBUSH ON MATTHEW'S GRAVE THIS AFTERNOON SAID ANNE DREAMILY I TOOK A SLIP OF THE LITTLE WHITE SCOTCH ROSEBUSH HIS MOTHER BROUGHT OUT FROM SCOTLAND LONG AGO
AT FIRST AS SHE TOLD DIANA SHE DID NOT REALLY THINK SHE COULD I'M POSITIVELY CERTAIN DIANA THAT LIFE CAN NEVER BE QUITE THE SAME AGAIN AS IT WAS IN THOSE OLDEN DAYS
AND FATHER DIED FOUR DAYS AFTERWARDS
IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE LOOK AT MY HAIR MARILLA SHE WHISPERED ACCORDINGLY MARILLA LIFTED HER CANDLE AND LOOKED SCRUTINIZINGLY AT ANNE'S HAIR FLOWING IN HEAVY MASSES DOWN HER BACK
BUT YOU KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU THIS TIME AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF I'M DOING RIGHT IT MAY MAKE YOU MORE ADDLEPATED THAN EVER BUT YOU CAN ASK DIANA TO COME OVER AND SPEND THE AFTERNOON WITH YOU AND HAVE TEA HERE OH MARILLA ANNE CLASPED HER HANDS
SAID MATTHEW WITH UNUSUAL VIM I DON'T FANCY HER STYLE MYSELF ADMITTED MARILLA BUT IT'S THAT OR KEEPING HER OURSELVES MATTHEW
I'M GOING OUT TO PUT THE MARE IN MARILLA HAVE TEA READY WHEN I COME BACK DID MISSUS SPENCER BRING ANYBODY OVER BESIDES YOU CONTINUED MARILLA WHEN MATTHEW HAD GONE OUT SHE BROUGHT LILY JONES FOR HERSELF
YES IT'S GREEN MOANED ANNE I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS RED HAIR BUT NOW I KNOW IT'S TEN TIMES WORSE TO HAVE GREEN HAIR
APPEALING TO HER DAUGHTER WHO HAD COME OUT TO THE STEPS SHE CERTAINLY DID MISS CUTHBERT CORROBORATED FLORA JANE EARNESTLY
BUT I'M GLAD MISS BARRY LIKED THEM IT SHOWS OUR CLUB IS DOING SOME GOOD IN THE WORLD MISSUS ALLAN SAYS THAT OUGHT TO BE OUR OBJECT IN EVERYTHING
BUT YOU SEE MATTHEW DID MATTHEW UNDERSTANDS ME AND IT'S SO NICE TO BE UNDERSTOOD MARILLA ANNE WAS TOO EXCITED TO DO HERSELF JUSTICE AS TO LESSONS THAT MORNING IN SCHOOL
BARRY GARDEN
SHE NEVER TELLS YOU IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT AND SHE HOPES YOU'LL BE A BETTER GIRL ON ACCOUNT OF IT MISSUS LYNDE ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT WHEN SHE CAME TO SEE ME AND SHE SAID IT IN A KIND OF WAY THAT MADE ME FEEL SHE MIGHT HOPE I'D BE A BETTER GIRL BUT DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE I WOULD EVEN JOSIE PYE CAME TO SEE ME
BUT I LIKE CORDELIA BETTER NOW BUT IF YOU CALL ME ANNE PLEASE CALL ME ANNE SPELLED WITH AN E WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE HOW IT'S SPELLED ASKED MARILLA WITH ANOTHER RUSTY SMILE AS SHE PICKED UP THE TEAPOT
SHE SAYS SHE THINKS IT WILL BE VERY BECOMING I WILL CALL IT A SNOOD THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC BUT AM I TALKING TOO MUCH MARILLA DOES IT HURT YOUR HEAD
I WAS ELEVEN LAST MARCH SAID ANNE RESIGNING HERSELF TO BALD FACTS WITH A LITTLE SIGH AND I WAS BORN IN BOLINGBROKE NOVA SCOTIA
THAT WILL BE JUST ABOUT THE SAME THING AS A SERMON PLEASE MAYN'T I GO MARILLA YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID ANNE DIDN'T YOU TAKE OFF YOUR BOOTS NOW AND GO TO BED IT'S PAST EIGHT THERE'S JUST ONE MORE THING MARILLA
IT WAS ENCIRCLED BY HUGE OLD WILLOWS AND TALL FIRS BENEATH WHICH FLOURISHED FLOWERS THAT LOVED THE SHADE PRIM RIGHT ANGLED PATHS NEATLY BORDERED WITH CLAMSHELLS INTERSECTED IT LIKE MOIST RED RIBBONS
SHE DIED OF FEVER WHEN I WAS JUST THREE MONTHS OLD I DO WISH SHE'D LIVED LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO REMEMBER CALLING HER MOTHER I THINK IT WOULD BE SO SWEET TO SAY MOTHER DON'T YOU AND FATHER DIED FOUR DAYS AFTERWARDS FROM FEVER TOO
WE'VE GOT TO DRIVE A LONG PIECE HAVEN'T WE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS EIGHT MILES I'M GLAD BECAUSE I LOVE DRIVING OH IT SEEMS SO WONDERFUL THAT I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH YOU AND BELONG TO YOU I'VE NEVER BELONGED TO ANYBODY NOT REALLY BUT THE ASYLUM WAS THE WORST I'VE ONLY BEEN IN IT FOUR MONTHS BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
IF YOU'LL ONLY LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I IMAGINE ABOUT MYSELF YOU'LL THINK IT EVER SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING
HOW ARE ALL YOUR FOLKS SOMETHING THAT FOR LACK OF ANY OTHER NAME MIGHT BE CALLED FRIENDSHIP EXISTED AND ALWAYS HAD EXISTED BETWEEN MARILLA CUTHBERT AND MISSUS RACHEL IN SPITE OF OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THEIR DISSIMILARITY MARILLA WAS A TALL
NOBODY EVER DID WANT ME I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT WAS ALL TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN NOBODY REALLY DID WANT ME
IT ISN'T RIGHT TO CRY SO I KNEW THAT TODAY BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT THEN HE'D ALWAYS BEEN SUCH A GOOD KIND BROTHER TO ME BUT GOD KNOWS BEST OH JUST LET ME CRY MARILLA SOBBED ANNE
HOW DO YOU DO MARILLA SHE SAID CORDIALLY COME IN
AND LILAC TINTED BOUNCING BETS CLUMPS OF SOUTHERNWOOD AND RIBBON GRASS AND MINT PURPLE ADAM AND EVE DAFFODILS AND MASSES OF SWEET CLOVER WHITE WITH ITS DELICATE FRAGRANT FEATHERY SPRAYS
WHAT ON EARTH PUT SUCH A NOTION INTO YOUR HEAD SHE DEMANDED DISAPPROVINGLY THIS HAD BEEN DONE WITHOUT HER ADVICE BEING ASKED AND MUST PERFORCE BE DISAPPROVED WELL WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR SOME TIME ALL WINTER IN FACT RETURNED MARILLA
I USED THE MOST PATHETIC LANGUAGE I COULD THINK OF AND SAID THOU AND THEE THOU AND THEE SEEM SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN YOU
ANNE YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SUCH THINGS REBUKED MARILLA STRIVING TO OVERCOME THAT UNHOLY TENDENCY TO LAUGHTER WHICH SHE WAS DISMAYED TO FIND GROWING UPON HER AND INDEED WHEN SHE TOLD THE WHOLE STORY TO MATTHEW THAT NIGHT SHE DID LAUGH HEARTILY OVER ANNE'S TRIBULATIONS
OH MARILLA I KNOW BY YOUR FACE THAT IT'S BEEN NO USE SHE SAID SORROWFULLY MISSUS BARRY WON'T FORGIVE ME MISSUS BARRY INDEED SNAPPED MARILLA OF ALL THE UNREASONABLE WOMEN I EVER SAW SHE'S THE WORST
BURST INTO TEARS SHE DID SITTING DOWN ON A CHAIR BY THE TABLE FLINGING HER ARMS OUT UPON IT AND BURYING HER FACE IN THEM SHE PROCEEDED TO CRY STORMILY MARILLA AND MATTHEW LOOKED AT EACH OTHER DEPRECATINGLY ACROSS THE STOVE
LOOKING AT ANNE OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYE
BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU IT WAS DARK WHEN SUPPER WAS READY AND STILL NO SIGN OF ANNE COMING HURRIEDLY OVER THE LOG BRIDGE OR UP LOVER'S LANE BREATHLESS AND REPENTANT WITH A SENSE OF NEGLECTED DUTIES
SAYS SHE ALWAYS FEELS SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANYONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE
JUST YOU STICK TO BALD FACTS BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING WHERE WERE YOU BORN AND HOW OLD ARE YOU I WAS ELEVEN LAST MARCH SAID ANNE RESIGNING HERSELF TO BALD FACTS WITH A LITTLE SIGH AND I WAS BORN IN BOLINGBROKE NOVA SCOTIA
NEITHER WOULD SHE HAVE BELIEVED THAT SHE REALLY LIKED ANNE MUCH BETTER AS SHE WAS ANNE WENT TO BED THAT NIGHT SPEECHLESS WITH MISERY BECAUSE MATTHEW HAD SAID THE WIND WAS ROUND NORTHEAST AND HE FEARED IT WOULD BE A RAINY DAY TOMORROW
ANNE HAD TO LIVE THROUGH MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AS IT HAPPENED ALMOST A MONTH HAVING ELAPSED SINCE THE LINIMENT CAKE EPISODE IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HER TO GET INTO FRESH TROUBLE OF SOME SORT LITTLE MISTAKES SUCH AS ABSENTMINDEDLY EMPTYING A PAN OF SKIM MILK
I AM SHE SAID ANNE WENT HOME TO AVONLEA WITH MATTHEW AND MARILLA THAT EVENING SHE HAD NOT BEEN HOME SINCE APRIL AND SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT WAIT ANOTHER DAY THE APPLE BLOSSOMS WERE OUT AND THE WORLD WAS FRESH AND YOUNG
OH IT'S JUST GLORIOUS TO THINK OF IT JOSIE PYE SAYS SHE HATES IT BUT THAT IS JUST BECAUSE JOSIE HAS SO LITTLE IMAGINATION DIANA AND RUBY GILLIS AND JANE ANDREWS ARE PREPARING A DIALOGUE CALLED A MORNING VISIT FOR NEXT FRIDAY
AND SHE LOOKED JUST LIKE A SERAPH I REALLY THINK I'D LIKE TO BE A MINISTER'S WIFE WHEN I GROW UP MARILLA A MINISTER MIGHTN'T MIND MY RED HAIR BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T BE THINKING OF SUCH WORLDLY THINGS
OH MARILLA YOU LITTLE KNOW HOW UTTERLY WRETCHED I AM I LITTLE KNOW HOW YOU GOT INTO THIS FIX BUT I MEAN TO FIND OUT SAID MARILLA COME RIGHT DOWN TO THE KITCHEN IT'S TOO COLD UP HERE
SHE HAD MANY VISITORS AND NOT A DAY PASSED WITHOUT ONE OR MORE OF THE SCHOOLGIRLS DROPPING IN TO BRING HER FLOWERS AND BOOKS AND TELL HER ALL THE HAPPENINGS IN THE JUVENILE WORLD OF AVONLEA EVERYBODY HAS BEEN SO GOOD AND KIND MARILLA SIGHED ANNE HAPPILY
I HOPE YOU WON'T HAVE OCCASION TO MAKE MANY MORE SUCH APOLOGIES I HOPE YOU'LL TRY TO CONTROL YOUR TEMPER NOW ANNE THAT WOULDN'T BE SO HARD IF PEOPLE WOULDN'T TWIT ME ABOUT MY LOOKS SAID ANNE WITH A SIGH
IT SEEMS THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE ABOUT THIS LITTLE GIRL MISSUS BLEWETT SHE SAID I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT MISTER AND MISS CUTHBERT WANTED A LITTLE GIRL TO ADOPT
AND THAT WALKING RIDGEPOLES WAS NOT A THING IN WHICH YOUR IMAGINATION HELPED YOU OUT MUCH NEVERTHELESS SHE MANAGED TO TAKE SEVERAL STEPS BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE CAME THEN SHE SWAYED LOST HER BALANCE
WHAT WOULD SHE DO WITHOUT THEIR INSPIRING RIVALRY WOULD NOT WORK EVEN AT A COEDUCATIONAL COLLEGE WITH A REAL DEGREE IN PROSPECT BE RATHER FLAT WITHOUT HER FRIEND THE ENEMY THE NEXT MORNING AT BREAKFAST IT SUDDENLY STRUCK ANNE THAT MATTHEW WAS NOT LOOKING WELL
OUGHT TO COUNT FOR SOMETHING MISSUS ALLAN IS ONE OF THE NATURALLY GOOD PEOPLE I LOVE HER PASSIONATELY YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE LIKE MATTHEW AND MISSUS ALLAN THAT YOU CAN LOVE RIGHT OFF WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
I SUPPOSE I COULD DO IT TO OBLIGE YOU SAID ANNE THOUGHTFULLY IT WOULD BE TRUE ENOUGH TO SAY I AM SORRY BECAUSE I AM SORRY NOW I WASN'T A BIT SORRY LAST NIGHT
MAYBE THEY WERE OUT OF BOYS OF THE BRAND YOU WANTED HE WALKED JAUNTILY AWAY BEING HUNGRY AND THE UNFORTUNATE MATTHEW WAS LEFT TO DO THAT WHICH WAS HARDER FOR HIM THAN BEARDING A LION IN ITS DEN WALK UP TO A GIRL A STRANGE GIRL AN ORPHAN GIRL
I'M GOING TO PUT THESE BOUGHS IN THE OLD BLUE JUG AND SET THEM ON MY TABLE MIND YOU DON'T DROP LEAVES ALL OVER THE STAIRS THEN I'M GOING ON A MEETING OF THE AID SOCIETY AT CARMODY THIS AFTERNOON ANNE AND I WON'T LIKELY BE HOME BEFORE DARK
I CAN AND A N N LOOKS DREADFUL BUT A N N E LOOKS SO MUCH MORE DISTINGUISHED
MADE HER THINK OF A CHICKEN JERKING ITS HEAD AND BESSIE TOLD JULIA NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAM
ISN'T IT LOVELY DON'T YOU THINK IT MUST BE GLAD TO BE A ROSE WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF ROSES COULD TALK I'M SURE THEY COULD TELL US SUCH LOVELY THINGS AND ISN'T PINK THE MOST BEWITCHING COLOR IN THE WORLD
PETER HAD ASKED HIM OF COURSE FOR MATTHEW CUTHBERT HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO VOLUNTEER INFORMATION ABOUT ANYTHING IN HIS WHOLE LIFE AND YET HERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT AT HALF PAST THREE ON THE AFTERNOON OF A BUSY DAY PLACIDLY DRIVING OVER THE HOLLOW AND UP THE HILL
MISSUS RACHEL KNEW THAT HE OUGHT BECAUSE SHE HAD HEARD HIM TELL PETER MORRISON THE EVENING BEFORE IN WILLIAM J BLAIR'S STORE OVER AT CARMODY THAT HE MEANT TO SOW HIS TURNIP SEED THE NEXT AFTERNOON
MISTER ALLAN THINKS SO TOO MISSUS LYNDE SAYS HE JUST WORSHIPS THE GROUND SHE TREADS ON AND SHE DOESN'T REALLY THINK IT RIGHT FOR A MINISTER TO SET HIS AFFECTIONS SO MUCH ON A MORTAL BEING BUT THEN DIANA
AND SOFTENED AT SIGHT OF THE CHILD'S PALE FACE WITH ITS LOOK OF MUTE MISERY THE MISERY OF A HELPLESS LITTLE CREATURE WHO FINDS ITSELF ONCE MORE
AT LAST THEY WERE READY CHEEKS SCARLET AND EYES GLOWING WITH EXCITEMENT TRUE ANNE COULD NOT HELP A LITTLE PANG WHEN SHE CONTRASTED HER PLAIN BLACK TAM AND SHAPELESS TIGHT SLEEVED HOMEMADE GRAY CLOTH COAT
SAID MARILLA AS IF GETTING BOYS FROM ORPHAN ASYLUMS IN NOVA SCOTIA WERE PART OF THE USUAL SPRING WORK ON ANY WELL REGULATED AVONLEA FARM INSTEAD OF BEING AN UNHEARD OF INNOVATION MISSUS RACHEL FELT THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE MENTAL JOLT SHE THOUGHT IN EXCLAMATION POINTS
THE NEXT MORNING ANNE HAVING WRESTLED WILDLY WITH DECIMALS THE ENTIRE EVENING BEFORE WOULD BE FIRST ONE AWFUL DAY THEY WERE TIES AND THEIR NAMES WERE WRITTEN UP TOGETHER IT WAS ALMOST AS BAD AS A TAKE NOTICE
AND I'M SURE I WOULDN'T MIND LOSING MY HAIR IN SOME SUCH FASHION HALF SO MUCH BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT A DREADFUL COLOR IS THERE I'M GOING TO WEEP
AND TELL HER ALL THE HAPPENINGS IN THE JUVENILE WORLD OF AVONLEA
I WAS THINKING THE LOVELIEST STORY ABOUT YOU AND ME DIANA I THOUGHT YOU WERE DESPERATELY ILL WITH SMALLPOX AND EVERYBODY DESERTED YOU BUT I WENT BOLDLY TO YOUR BEDSIDE AND NURSED YOU BACK TO LIFE
AS IF THE AIR HAD BEEN STRAINED SO LONG THROUGH DARK GREEN CLOSELY DRAWN BLINDS THAT IT HAD LOST EVERY PARTICLE OF WARMTH IT HAD EVER POSSESSED
BUT SHE HAD HEARD OF HER A TERRIBLE WORKER AND DRIVER MISSUS PETER WAS SAID TO BE AND DISCHARGED SERVANT GIRLS TOLD FEARSOME TALES OF HER TEMPER AND STINGINESS
OH IT WAS SUCH A PATHETIC TALE DIANA THE TEARS JUST RAINED DOWN OVER MY CHEEKS WHILE I MIXED THE CAKE BUT I FORGOT THE FLOUR AND THE CAKE WAS A DISMAL FAILURE FLOUR IS SO ESSENTIAL TO CAKES YOU KNOW MARILLA WAS
ITS VERY UNACCUSTOMEDNESS AND SWEETNESS DISTURBED HER SHE HASTENED TO RESTORE HER SENSATIONS TO THEIR NORMAL CALM BY INCULCATING A MORAL IF YOU'LL BE A GOOD GIRL
YOU'D LIKELY SET THE PLACE ON FIRE WHEN MARILLA HAD GONE ANNE LOOKED AROUND HER WISTFULLY THE WHITEWASHED WALLS WERE SO PAINFULLY BARE AND STARING THAT SHE THOUGHT THEY MUST ACHE OVER THEIR OWN BARENESS THE FLOOR WAS BARE TOO
ANNE NODDED TRYING HARD NOT TO LOOK VIRTUOUSLY COMPLACENT AND FAILING MISERABLY I WROTE IT LAST MONDAY EVENING IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR
I HOPE I SHALL BE A LITTLE LIKE MISSUS ALLAN WHEN I GROW UP DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY PROSPECT OF IT MARILLA I SHOULDN'T SAY THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL WAS MARILLA'S ENCOURAGING ANSWER I'M SURE MISSUS ALLAN
OPENED HIS EYES AND SAID DECIDEDLY WELL NOW MARILLA
AND I KNOW ANOTHER CASE WHERE AN ADOPTED BOY USED TO SUCK THE EGGS THEY COULDN'T BREAK HIM OF IT IF YOU HAD ASKED MY ADVICE IN THE MATTER WHICH YOU DIDN'T DO MARILLA I'D HAVE SAID FOR MERCY'S SAKE NOT TO THINK OF SUCH A THING THAT'S WHAT
ANNE COULD NOT SAY THE DREADFUL WORD SHE TURNED SICK AND PALLID CHILD YES I'M AFRAID OF IT LOOK AT HIS FACE WHEN YOU'VE SEEN THAT LOOK AS OFTEN AS I HAVE YOU'LL KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
WHEN SAM SLOANE PROCEEDED TO EXPLAIN AND ILLUSTRATE HOW SOCKERY SET A HEN ANNE LAUGHED UNTIL PEOPLE SITTING NEAR HER LAUGHED TOO MORE OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH HER THAN WITH AMUSEMENT AT A SELECTION THAT WAS RATHER THREADBARE EVEN IN AVONLEA
ANNE'S LITTLE TRIUMPH DIANA MIGHT JUST HAVE SMILED AT ME ONCE I THINK SHE MOURNED TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT BUT THE NEXT MORNING A NOTE MOST FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY TWISTED AND FOLDED
ANNE HOPED THAT THE TEARS WOULD COME IN SOLITUDE IT SEEMED TO HER A TERRIBLE THING THAT SHE COULD NOT SHED A TEAR FOR MATTHEW WHOM SHE HAD LOVED SO MUCH AND WHO HAD BEEN SO KIND TO HER
AND THAT WAS JUST GIVING IT AWAY SO I BOUGHT IT AND AS SOON AS HE HAD GONE I CAME UP HERE AND APPLIED IT WITH AN OLD HAIRBRUSH AS THE DIRECTIONS SAID I USED UP THE WHOLE BOTTLE AND OH MARILLA
ANNE FLEW DOWN TO THE HOLLOW PAST THE DRYAD'S BUBBLE AND UP THE SPRUCE PATH TO ORCHARD SLOPE TO ASK DIANA TO TEA AS A RESULT JUST AFTER MARILLA HAD DRIVEN OFF TO CARMODY DIANA CAME OVER DRESSED IN HER SECOND BEST DRESS AND LOOKING EXACTLY AS IT IS PROPER TO LOOK WHEN ASKED OUT TO TEA
MARILLA CUTHBERT YOU'RE FAIRLY IN FOR IT DID YOU EVER SUPPOSE YOU'D SEE THE DAY WHEN YOU'D BE ADOPTING AN ORPHAN GIRL IT'S SURPRISING ENOUGH
WHEN THE BIRCHES IN THE HOLLOW TURNED AS GOLDEN AS SUNSHINE AND THE MAPLES BEHIND THE ORCHARD WERE ROYAL CRIMSON AND THE WILD CHERRY TREES ALONG THE LANE PUT ON THE LOVELIEST SHADES OF DARK RED AND BRONZY GREEN WHILE THE FIELDS SUNNED THEMSELVES IN AFTERMATHS
ANNE COMES TO GRIEF IN AN AFFAIR OF HONOR ANNE HAD TO LIVE THROUGH MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AS IT HAPPENED ALMOST A MONTH HAVING ELAPSED SINCE THE LINIMENT CAKE EPISODE IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HER TO GET INTO FRESH TROUBLE OF SOME SORT LITTLE MISTAKES
THIN WOMAN WITH ANGLES AND WITHOUT CURVES HER DARK HAIR SHOWED SOME GRAY STREAKS AND WAS ALWAYS TWISTED UP IN A HARD LITTLE KNOT BEHIND WITH TWO WIRE HAIRPINS STUCK AGGRESSIVELY THROUGH IT SHE LOOKED LIKE A WOMAN OF NARROW EXPERIENCE AND RIGID CONSCIENCE WHICH SHE WAS
AND I THINK I HAVE BEEN PUNISHED SO MUCH THAT YOU NEEDN'T BE VERY CROSS WITH ME MARILLA IT'S NOT A BIT NICE TO FAINT AFTER ALL AND THE DOCTOR HURT ME DREADFULLY WHEN HE WAS SETTING MY ANKLE I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO AROUND FOR SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS AND I'LL MISS THE NEW LADY TEACHER
VERY WELL THEN ANNE SPELLED WITH AN E CAN YOU TELL US HOW THIS MISTAKE CAME TO BE MADE WE SENT WORD TO MISSUS SPENCER TO BRING US A BOY WERE THERE NO BOYS AT THE ASYLUM OH YES THERE WAS AN ABUNDANCE OF THEM
OF A WAKENING IN THE WORLD AND A STIR OF HIDDEN PULSES UNDER THE GRAY SOD THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND MARILLA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP
PERHAPS I'LL GET ON BETTER IN FOUR MORE YEARS WE'LL BE ABLE TO PUT OUR HAIR UP SAID DIANA ALICE BELL IS ONLY SIXTEEN AND SHE IS WEARING HERS UP BUT I THINK THAT'S RIDICULOUS
ANNE GAVE HERSELF UP TO A SILENT RAPTURE OVER THE SHORE ROAD AND MARILLA
IT WILL HELP ME THROUGH SPLENDIDLY I EXPECT WHAT DO PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T ANY IMAGINATION DO WHEN THEY BREAK THEIR BONES DO YOU SUPPOSE MARILLA ANNE HAD GOOD REASON TO BLESS HER IMAGINATION MANY A TIME AND OFT DURING THE TEDIOUS SEVEN WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED BUT SHE WAS NOT SOLELY DEPENDENT ON IT
THEY FOUND ANNE LYING ALL WHITE AND LIMP AMONG THE WRECK AND RUIN OF THE VIRGINIA CREEPER ANNE ARE YOU KILLED SHRIEKED DIANA THROWING HERSELF ON HER KNEES BESIDE HER FRIEND OH ANNE DEAR ANNE SPEAK JUST ONE WORD TO ME AND TELL ME IF YOU'RE KILLED TO THE IMMENSE RELIEF OF ALL THE GIRLS
THEY WOULDN'T MAKE UP FOR MISSING THIS ONE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE BOATS ON THE LAKE OF SHINING WATERS AND ICE CREAM AS I TOLD YOU I HAVE NEVER TASTED ICE CREAM DIANA TRIED TO EXPLAIN
AND HER FAMILY OF PERT QUARRELSOME CHILDREN MARILLA FELT A QUALM OF CONSCIENCE AT THE THOUGHT OF HANDING ANNE OVER TO HER TENDER MERCIES
BUT JUST NOW I FEEL AS IF IT WERE JOY ENOUGH TO SIT HERE AND LOOK AT YOU I'M TIRED I THINK TIRED OF BEING STUDIOUS AND AMBITIOUS I MEAN TO SPEND AT LEAST TWO HOURS TOMORROW LYING OUT IN THE ORCHARD GRASS THINKING OF ABSOLUTELY NOTHING YOU'VE DONE SPLENDIDLY ANNE
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE YOURSELF I NEVER TASTED IT SAID ANNE I THOUGHT IT WAS THE CORDIAL I MEANT TO BE SO SO HOSPITABLE DIANA GOT AWFULLY SICK AND HAD TO GO HOME MISSUS BARRY TOLD MISSUS LYNDE SHE WAS SIMPLY DEAD DRUNK
THE TUMBLERFULS WERE GENEROUS ONES AND THE RASPBERRY CORDIAL WAS CERTAINLY VERY NICE THE NICEST I EVER DRANK SAID DIANA IT'S EVER SO MUCH NICER THAN MISSUS LYNDE'S ALTHOUGH SHE BRAGS OF HERS SO MUCH
ANNE LAUGHED AND PELTED DIANA WITH THE FADED JUNE LILIES OF HER BOUQUET STELLA MAYNARD IS THE DEAREST GIRL IN THE WORLD EXCEPT ONE AND YOU ARE THAT ONE DIANA SHE SAID I LOVE YOU MORE THAN EVER AND I'VE SO MANY THINGS TO TELL YOU
THE BIG RAMBLING ORCHARD EMBOWERED HOUSE WHERE THE CUTHBERTS LIVED WAS A SCANT QUARTER OF A MILE UP THE ROAD FROM LYNDE'S HOLLOW TO BE SURE THE LONG LANE MADE IT A GOOD DEAL FURTHER MATTHEW CUTHBERT'S FATHER AS SHY AND SILENT AS HIS SON AFTER HIM
I DIDN'T SAY THAT MATTHEW AND I HAD ABSOLUTELY DECIDED THAT WE WOULDN'T KEEP HER IN FACT I MAY SAY THAT MATTHEW IS DISPOSED TO KEEP HER I JUST CAME OVER TO FIND OUT HOW THE MISTAKE HAD OCCURRED I THINK I'D BETTER TAKE HER HOME AGAIN AND TALK IT OVER WITH MATTHEW
MISSUS LYNDE I AM SO EXTREMELY SORRY SHE SAID WITH A QUIVER IN HER VOICE I COULD NEVER EXPRESS ALL MY SORROW NO NOT IF I USED UP A WHOLE DICTIONARY YOU MUST JUST IMAGINE IT
AND REWARDED THE DONOR WITH A SMILE WHICH EXALTED THAT INFATUATED YOUTH STRAIGHTWAY INTO THE SEVENTH HEAVEN OF DELIGHT AND CAUSED HIM TO MAKE SUCH FEARFUL ERRORS IN HIS DICTATION THAT MISTER PHILLIPS KEPT HIM IN AFTER SCHOOL TO REWRITE IT
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE NEXT FRIDAY THAT MARILLA HEARD THE STORY OF THE FLOWER WREATHED HAT SHE CAME HOME FROM MISSUS LYNDE'S AND CALLED ANNE TO ACCOUNT ANNE MISSUS RACHEL SAYS YOU WENT TO CHURCH LAST SUNDAY WITH YOUR HAT RIGGED OUT RIDICULOUS
TO DO HER JUSTICE SHE REALLY BELIEVED ANNE HAD MADE DIANA DRUNK OUT OF SHEER MALICE PREPENSE AND SHE WAS HONESTLY ANXIOUS TO PRESERVE HER LITTLE DAUGHTER FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF FURTHER INTIMACY WITH SUCH A CHILD WHAT DO YOU WANT SHE SAID STIFFLY
WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT YOURSELF OH WHAT I KNOW ABOUT MYSELF ISN'T REALLY WORTH TELLING SAID ANNE EAGERLY IF YOU'LL ONLY LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I IMAGINE ABOUT MYSELF YOU'LL THINK IT EVER SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING NO I DON'T WANT ANY OF YOUR IMAGININGS
I ASSURE YOU IT TOOK ME SOME TIME TO THINK IT OUT I STAYED AWAKE NEARLY A WHOLE NIGHT BEFORE I INVENTED IT THEN JUST AS I WAS DROPPING OFF TO SLEEP IT CAME LIKE AN INSPIRATION DIANA WAS ENRAPTURED WHEN SHE HEARD IT
DULY CULTIVATED FOR WALKING BOARD FENCES
DON'T YOU THINK DIANA HAS GOT VERY SOULFUL EYES I WISH I HAD SOULFUL EYES
MATTHEW ENJOYED THE DRIVE AFTER HIS OWN FASHION EXCEPT DURING THE MOMENTS WHEN HE MET WOMEN AND HAD TO NOD TO THEM FOR IN PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO NOD TO ALL AND SUNDRY YOU MEET ON THE ROAD WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM OR NOT MATTHEW DREADED ALL WOMEN EXCEPT MARILLA AND MISSUS RACHEL
I USED TO GET SO DREADFULLY TIRED CARRYING THEM ABOUT I LIVED UP RIVER WITH MISSUS HAMMOND OVER TWO YEARS AND THEN MISTER HAMMOND DIED AND MISSUS HAMMOND BROKE UP HOUSEKEEPING SHE DIVIDED HER CHILDREN AMONG HER RELATIVES AND WENT TO THE STATES
THERE'D BE NO SCOPE FOR IMAGINATION THEN WOULD THERE BUT AM I TALKING TOO MUCH PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS TELLING ME I DO WOULD YOU RATHER I DIDN'T TALK IF YOU SAY SO I'LL STOP I CAN STOP WHEN I MAKE UP MY MIND TO IT ALTHOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT MATTHEW
IF HE'D RUN OUT OF TURNIP SEED HE WOULDN'T DRESS UP AND TAKE THE BUGGY TO GO FOR MORE
AND THAT IF SHE NOTICED ANYTHING ODD OR OUT OF PLACE SHE WOULD NEVER REST UNTIL SHE HAD FERRETED OUT THE WHYS AND WHEREFORES THEREOF THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN AVONLEA AND OUT OF IT WHO CAN ATTEND CLOSELY TO THEIR NEIGHBOR'S BUSINESS BY DINT OF NEGLECTING THEIR OWN
AND SEE IF THAT WILL DO ANY GOOD ACCORDINGLY ANNE WASHED HER HAIR SCRUBBING IT VIGOROUSLY WITH SOAP AND WATER BUT FOR ALL THE DIFFERENCE IT MADE SHE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN SCOURING ITS ORIGINAL RED
I'M ONE OF THE OTHERS MISSUS LYNDE SAYS I'M FULL OF ORIGINAL SIN NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY TO BE GOOD I CAN NEVER MAKE SUCH A SUCCESS OF IT AS THOSE WHO ARE NATURALLY GOOD IT'S A GOOD DEAL LIKE GEOMETRY I EXPECT
MISSUS BARRY CAME TO THE KITCHEN DOOR IN ANSWER TO MARILLA'S KNOCK SHE WAS A TALL BLACK EYED BLACK HAIRED WOMAN WITH A VERY RESOLUTE MOUTH
IT CERTAINLY HAD A VERY STRANGE APPEARANCE ANNE SHIRLEY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO YOUR HAIR WHY IT'S GREEN GREEN IT MIGHT BE CALLED IF IT WERE ANY EARTHLY COLOR
LOOKING AT PRISSY ANDREWS AT THE END OF EVERY SENTENCE ANNE FELT THAT SHE COULD RISE AND MUTINY ON THE SPOT IF BUT ONE ROMAN CITIZEN LED THE WAY ONLY ONE NUMBER ON THE PROGRAM FAILED TO INTEREST HER WHEN GILBERT BLYTHE RECITED
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL WHAT DID THAT TREE LEANING OUT FROM THE BANK ALL WHITE AND LACY MAKE YOU THINK OF SHE ASKED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW WHY A BRIDE OF COURSE A BRIDE ALL IN WHITE WITH A LOVELY MISTY VEIL
BUT THEN OF COURSE ONE WOULD HAVE TO BE NATURALLY GOOD AND I'LL NEVER BE THAT SO I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO USE IN THINKING ABOUT IT SOME PEOPLE ARE NATURALLY GOOD YOU KNOW AND OTHERS ARE NOT
LADEN WITH THE SPICY PERFUME OF YOUNG DEW WET FERNS FAR UP IN THE SHADOWS A CHEERFUL LIGHT GLEAMED OUT THROUGH THE TREES FROM THE KITCHEN AT GREEN GABLES ANNE SUDDENLY CAME CLOSE TO MARILLA
SAID ANNE PASSIONATELY SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE A LIKE A GIMLET MARILLA SMOTHERED A SMILE UNDER THE CONVICTION THAT ANNE MUST BE REPROVED FOR SUCH A SPEECH
AND I'M CLEAN WORN OUT ATTENDING TO HIM
AND YOU NEEDN'T STOP TO DISCOURSE WITH SYMPATHETIC LISTENERS ON YOUR WAY EITHER AS FOR THE PICNIC OF COURSE YOU CAN GO YOU'RE A SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHOLAR AND IT'S NOT LIKELY I'D REFUSE TO LET YOU GO WHEN ALL THE OTHER LITTLE GIRLS ARE GOING
BECAUSE THERE IS A BIG CONCERT IN THE WHITE SANDS HOTEL TONIGHT AND HER SISTER IS TO RECITE AT IT
SHE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT RATHER SACRILEGIOUS TO LEAVE IT OFF AS BAD AS FORGETTING HER BIBLE OR HER COLLECTION DIME THAT AMETHYST BROOCH WAS MARILLA'S MOST TREASURED POSSESSION A SEAFARING UNCLE HAD GIVEN IT TO HER
THE SHORE ROAD WAS WOODSY AND WILD AND LONESOME ON THE RIGHT HAND SCRUB FIRS THEIR SPIRITS QUITE UNBROKEN BY LONG YEARS OF TUSSLE WITH THE GULF WINDS GREW THICKLY
CAN I USE THE ROSEBUD SPRAY TEA SET NO INDEED THE ROSEBUD TEA SET WELL WHAT NEXT YOU KNOW I NEVER USE THAT EXCEPT FOR THE MINISTER OR THE AIDS
AND THE RECOLLECTION OF THE DAY CAME OVER HER LIKE A WAVE OF SORROW SHE COULD SEE MATTHEW'S FACE SMILING AT HER AS HE HAD SMILED
YES I SUPPOSE SO SAID MATTHEW RELUCTANTLY YOU SUPPOSE SO DON'T YOU KNOW IT
MATTHEW MATTHEW WHAT IS THE MATTER MATTHEW ARE YOU SICK IT WAS MARILLA WHO SPOKE ALARM IN EVERY JERKY WORD ANNE CAME THROUGH THE HALL HER HANDS FULL OF WHITE NARCISSUS IT WAS LONG BEFORE ANNE COULD LOVE THE SIGHT OR ODOR OF WHITE NARCISSUS AGAIN
THAT LEFT ME AN ORPHAN AND FOLKS WERE AT THEIR WITS END SO MISSUS THOMAS SAID WHAT TO DO WITH ME YOU SEE NOBODY WANTED ME EVEN THEN IT SEEMS TO BE MY FATE
NOW GILBERT WAS HEAD OF THE SPELLING CLASS NOW ANNE WITH A TOSS OF HER LONG RED BRAIDS SPELLED HIM DOWN ONE MORNING GILBERT HAD ALL HIS SUMS DONE CORRECTLY AND HAD HIS NAME WRITTEN ON THE BLACKBOARD ON THE ROLL OF HONOR
VERY DETERMINEDLY AND STEADILY SHE TOOK HER WAY DOWN THROUGH THE SERE CLOVER FIELD OVER THE LOG BRIDGE AND UP THROUGH THE SPRUCE GROVE LIGHTED BY A PALE LITTLE MOON HANGING LOW OVER THE WESTERN WOODS
SO I DON'T THINK YOU'RE VERY BADLY OFF TO SEE HER AGAIN BUT SHE WANTS TO SEE ME PLEADED ANNE SHE HAS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL ME HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE HAS
AND TELL ME JUST WHAT YOU'VE DONE I'VE BEEN EXPECTING SOMETHING QUEER FOR SOME TIME YOU HAVEN'T GOT INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR OVER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE NOW THEN
TAKING THE VEIL TO BURY A BROKEN HEART IN CLOISTERED SECLUSION AND I FORGOT ALL ABOUT COVERING THE PUDDING SAUCE I THOUGHT OF IT NEXT MORNING AND RAN TO THE PANTRY DIANA
AFTER TEA MISSUS ALLAN PLAYED AND SANG AND SHE GOT LAURETTA AND ME TO SING TOO MISSUS ALLAN SAYS I HAVE A GOOD VOICE AND SHE SAYS I MUST SING IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHOIR AFTER THIS YOU CAN'T THINK
ANNE NODDED YES I HAVE TWO THE MATRON OF THE ASYLUM MADE THEM FOR ME
WHEN THEY WENT UP THE ENTRANCE STEPS OF QUEEN'S
AND A FULL SOFT BROWN BEARD WHICH HE HAD WORN EVER SINCE HE WAS TWENTY IN FACT HE HAD LOOKED AT TWENTY VERY MUCH AS HE LOOKED AT SIXTY LACKING A LITTLE OF THE GRAYNESS WHEN HE REACHED BRIGHT RIVER THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY TRAIN
THAT'S A SENTENCE I READ IN A BOOK ONCE
ANNE HAD GOOD REASON TO BLESS HER IMAGINATION MANY A TIME AND OFT DURING THE TEDIOUS SEVEN WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED
AND THEN THE GIRLS WERE AROUND THEM AND ANNE WAS THE CENTER OF A LAUGHING CONGRATULATING GROUP HER SHOULDERS WERE THUMPED
IN AND OUT AMONG THE FERNS AND RUSTLING BOUGHS
AND HER AFTERNOON'S ENJOYMENT WAS SPOILED I'LL JUST STEP OVER TO GREEN GABLES AFTER TEA AND FIND OUT FROM MARILLA WHERE HE'S GONE AND WHY THE WORTHY WOMAN FINALLY CONCLUDED HE DOESN'T GENERALLY GO TO TOWN THIS TIME OF YEAR AND HE NEVER VISITS
IT SEEMS UNCANNY TO THINK OF A CHILD AT GREEN GABLES SOMEHOW THERE'S NEVER BEEN ONE THERE FOR MATTHEW AND MARILLA WERE GROWN UP WHEN THE NEW HOUSE WAS BUILT IF THEY EVER WERE CHILDREN WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THEM I WOULDN'T BE IN THAT ORPHAN'S SHOES FOR ANYTHING
WAS WAITING PATIENTLY FOR HIS TEA IN HIS CORNER SHE'S GADDING OFF SOMEWHERE WITH DIANA WRITING STORIES OR PRACTICING DIALOGUES OR SOME SUCH TOMFOOLERY AND NEVER THINKING ONCE ABOUT THE TIME OR HER DUTIES
AND EVERYBODY MISSED ANNE SO AND WISHED SHE'S COME TO SCHOOL AGAIN AND GILBERT BLYTHE BUT ANNE DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT GILBERT BLYTHE
THAT IS ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING THIRTEEN YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE WELL WHAT BECAME OF CORDELIA AND GERALDINE ASKED DIANA
AND SHE DID NOT EVEN FEEL GRATEFUL FOR IT SHE KNEW MISSUS PETER BLEWETT ONLY BY SIGHT AS A SMALL SHREWISH FACED WOMAN
JUST THE SAME ANNE HAS NO BUSINESS TO LEAVE THE HOUSE LIKE THIS WHEN I TOLD HER SHE WAS TO STAY HOME THIS AFTERNOON AND LOOK AFTER THINGS I MUST SAY
THEY TASTE TWICE AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER COLOR THE ORCHARD WITH ITS GREAT SWEEPING BOUGHS THAT BENT TO THE GROUND WITH FRUIT PROVED SO DELIGHTFUL THAT THE LITTLE GIRLS SPENT MOST OF THE AFTERNOON IN IT
THEREOF EXALTED HER TO DIZZY REALMS OF DELIGHT MARILLA HAD ALMOST BEGUN TO DESPAIR OF EVER FASHIONING THIS WAIF OF THE WORLD INTO HER MODEL LITTLE GIRL OF DEMURE MANNERS AND PRIM DEPORTMENT
I'VE NEVER BROUGHT UP A CHILD ESPECIALLY A GIRL AND I DARE SAY I'LL MAKE A TERRIBLE MESS OF IT BUT I'LL DO MY BEST SO FAR AS I'M CONCERNED MATTHEW SHE MAY STAY MATTHEW'S SHY FACE WAS A GLOW OF DELIGHT
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T LIVE VERY LONG AFTER THAT YOU SEE SHE DIED OF FEVER WHEN I WAS JUST THREE MONTHS OLD I DO WISH SHE'D LIVED LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO REMEMBER CALLING HER MOTHER
I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID JOSIE FLATLY I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY COULD WALK A RIDGEPOLE YOU COULDN'T ANYHOW COULDN'T I CRIED ANNE RASHLY THEN I DARE YOU TO DO IT SAID JOSIE DEFIANTLY
WALKED WITH THEIR ARMS ABOUT EACH OTHER AT THE BROOK THEY PARTED WITH MANY PROMISES TO SPEND THE NEXT AFTERNOON TOGETHER WELL DID YOU FIND DIANA A KINDRED SPIRIT ASKED MARILLA AS THEY WENT UP THROUGH THE GARDEN OF GREEN GABLES
THEN DIANA PUTS TOO MANY MURDERS INTO HERS SHE SAYS MOST OF THE TIME SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE SO SHE KILLS THEM OFF TO GET RID OF THEM I MOSTLY ALWAYS HAVE TO TELL THEM WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT BUT THAT ISN'T HARD
SHE REFLECTED AS SHE STRAINED THE MILK INTO THE CREAMERS
SHE WILL NEVER BELIEVE BUT WHAT I DID IT ON PURPOSE I SHOULD THINK SHE WOULD BETTER PUNISH DIANA FOR BEING SO GREEDY AS TO DRINK THREE GLASSFULS OF ANYTHING SAID MARILLA SHORTLY WHY THREE OF THOSE BIG GLASSES WOULD HAVE MADE HER SICK EVEN IF IT HAD ONLY BEEN CORDIAL
SHE IS SUCH A PERFECT HOUSEKEEPER AND FANCY WHAT SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT OF US MARILLA TURNED RED AS FIRE BUT SHE NEVER SAID A WORD THEN SHE JUST CARRIED THAT SAUCE AND PUDDING OUT AND BROUGHT IN SOME STRAWBERRY PRESERVES SHE EVEN OFFERED ME SOME
AND THEN PRESSING HER TO TAKE ANOTHER PIECE OF FRUIT CAKE AND ANOTHER HELPING OF PRESERVES OH MARILLA IT'S A WONDERFUL SENSATION JUST TO THINK OF IT CAN I TAKE HER INTO THE SPARE ROOM TO LAY OFF HER HAT WHEN SHE COMES AND THEN INTO THE PARLOR TO SIT NO
IT WOULD UNSETTLE HER FOR A WEEK I UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD'S DISPOSITION AND WHAT'S GOOD FOR IT BETTER THAN YOU MATTHEW I THINK YOU OUGHT TO LET ANNE GO REPEATED MATTHEW FIRMLY ARGUMENT WAS NOT HIS STRONG POINT BUT HOLDING FAST TO HIS OPINION CERTAINLY WAS
AND HE WON'T SPARE HIMSELF A MITE I'VE BEEN REAL WORRIED ABOUT HIM BUT HE'S SOME BETTER THIS WHILE BACK AND WE'VE GOT A GOOD HIRED MAN
WE WERE SO FAR FROM A SCHOOL THAT I COULDN'T WALK IT IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A VACATION IN SUMMER SO I COULD ONLY GO IN THE SPRING AND FALL
UNGRACIOUSLY DURING MARILLA'S SPEECH A SUNRISE HAD BEEN DAWNING ON ANNE'S FACE FIRST THE LOOK OF DESPAIR FADED OUT THEN CAME A FAINT FLUSH OF HOPE HER EYES GREW DEEP AND BRIGHT AS MORNING STARS THE CHILD WAS QUITE TRANSFIGURED
THEY HAD A PERFECTLY ELEGANT TEA AND THEN CAME THE DELICIOUS OCCUPATION OF DRESSING IN DIANA'S LITTLE ROOM UPSTAIRS
SHE PROBABLY IMAGINED THAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT THE AIDS AND THEIR MISSIONARY BOX AND THE NEW CARPET FOR THE VESTRY ROOM BUT UNDER THESE REFLECTIONS WAS A HARMONIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS OF RED FIELDS
I SHALL BE SO GLAD WHEN I CAN GO TO SCHOOL FOR I'VE HEARD SUCH EXCITING THINGS ABOUT THE NEW TEACHER THE GIRLS ALL THINK SHE IS PERFECTLY SWEET DIANA SAYS SHE HAS THE LOVELIEST FAIR CURLY HAIR AND SUCH FASCINATING EYES SHE DRESSES BEAUTIFULLY AND HER SLEEVE PUFFS ARE BIGGER THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S IN AVONLEA
EVIDENTLY SHE DID NOT LIKE TALKING ABOUT HER EXPERIENCES IN A WORLD THAT HAD NOT WANTED HER DID YOU EVER GO TO SCHOOL DEMANDED MARILLA TURNING THE SORREL MARE DOWN THE SHORE ROAD
ANNE LOOKED AT THE STILL FACE AND THERE BEHELD THE SEAL OF THE GREAT PRESENCE WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME HE SAID THAT DEATH HAD BEEN INSTANTANEOUS AND PROBABLY PAINLESS CAUSED IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BY SOME SUDDEN SHOCK
SAID ANNE GRAVELY THEN ASIDE TO MARILLA IN AN AUDIBLE WHISPER THERE WASN'T ANYTHING STARTLING IN THAT WAS THERE MARILLA DIANA WAS SITTING ON THE SOFA READING A BOOK WHICH SHE DROPPED
MISSUS BARRY WILL THINK BETTER OF IT WHEN SHE FINDS YOU'RE NOT TO BLAME I SUPPOSE SHE THINKS YOU'VE DONE IT FOR A SILLY JOKE OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT YOU'D BEST GO UP THIS EVENING AND TELL HER HOW IT WAS
SENSIBLE MARILLA HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARS ANNE HERSELF ANSWERED LIFTING HER HEAD DON'T BE VERY FRIGHTENED MARILLA I WAS WALKING THE RIDGEPOLE AND I FELL OFF I EXPECT I HAVE SPRAINED MY ANKLE
AS SHE TALKED AND SOMEHOW FELT THAT WIND AND STARS AND FIREFLIES WERE ALL TANGLED UP TOGETHER INTO SOMETHING UNUTTERABLY SWEET AND ENCHANTING OH MARILLA
NOW DON'T GET INTO A FLUSTER AND I DO WISH YOU WOULDN'T USE SUCH LONG WORDS IT SOUNDS SO FUNNY IN A LITTLE GIRL I GUESS DIANA'LL LIKE YOU WELL ENOUGH IT'S HER MOTHER YOU'VE GOT TO RECKON WITH
MERCY ME THE CHILD HAS GONE AND FAINTED IT WAS QUITE TRUE OVERCOME BY THE PAIN OF HER INJURY ANNE HAD ONE MORE OF HER WISHES GRANTED TO HER SHE HAD FAINTED DEAD AWAY MATTHEW HASTILY SUMMONED FROM THE HARVEST FIELD WAS STRAIGHTWAY DISPATCHED FOR THE DOCTOR
SHE'S A CASE I SHOULD SAY I'M NOT EXPECTING A GIRL SAID MATTHEW BLANKLY IT'S A BOY I'VE COME FOR HE SHOULD BE HERE MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS TO BRING HIM OVER FROM NOVA SCOTIA FOR ME THE STATIONMASTER WHISTLED
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING WHEN JOSIE SAID THAT TO ME ANNE CONFIDED THAT EVENING TO MARILLA WHO WAS LYING ON THE SOFA AFTER ONE OF HER HEADACHES BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS PART OF MY PUNISHMENT AND I OUGHT TO BEAR IT PATIENTLY
LET'S GO OUT TO THE ORCHARD AND GET SOME OF THE RED SWEETINGS DIANA MARILLA SAYS WE CAN HAVE ALL THAT ARE LEFT ON THE TREE MARILLA IS A VERY GENEROUS WOMAN SHE SAID WE COULD HAVE FRUIT CAKE AND CHERRY PRESERVES FOR TEA
THEY ALL CROWDED INTO THE BIG PUNG SLEIGH AMONG STRAW AND FURRY ROBES
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THESE TRIFLING FRICTIONS WORK IN MISS STACY'S LITTLE KINGDOM WENT ON WITH REGULARITY AND SMOOTHNESS THE WINTER WEEKS SLIPPED BY
SHE WENT NOWHERE AND SHAMPOOED HER HAIR EVERY DAY DIANA ALONE OF OUTSIDERS KNEW THE FATAL SECRET BUT SHE PROMISED SOLEMNLY NEVER TO TELL AND IT MAY BE STATED HERE AND NOW THAT SHE KEPT HER WORD
IT WOULDN'T BE SO HARD WHAT ON EARTH DOES SHE MEAN DEMANDED MARILLA STARING AT MATTHEW SHE SHE'S JUST REFERRING TO SOME CONVERSATION WE HAD ON THE ROAD SAID MATTHEW HASTILY
BUT I KNEW A GIRL ONCE WENT TO SCHOOL WITH HER IN FACT WHOSE HAIR WAS EVERY MITE AS RED AS YOURS WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG BUT WHEN SHE GREW UP IT DARKENED TO A REAL HANDSOME AUBURN
MISSUS RACHEL WOULD HAVE LIKED TO STAY UNTIL MATTHEW CAME HOME WITH HIS IMPORTED ORPHAN BUT REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD TWO HOURS AT LEAST BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL SHE CONCLUDED TO GO UP THE ROAD TO ROBERT BELL'S AND TELL THE NEWS IT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE A SENSATION SECOND TO NONE
NONSENSE SAID MARILLA VEXED AT HERSELF FOR HAVING MADE THE CHILD CRY I DON'T WANT TO SEND YOU BACK TO THE ASYLUM I'M SURE ALL I WANT IS THAT YOU SHOULD BEHAVE LIKE OTHER LITTLE GIRLS AND NOT MAKE YOURSELF RIDICULOUS DON'T CRY ANY MORE I'VE GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU
WENT OUT IN QUEST OF A RECIPE THE LATTER HAD COME TO BORROW SHE SPRANG UP AND FLEW ACROSS THE ROOM TO MARILLA
BUT IF HE HAD CUT THE END OF HIS NOSE OFF HE WOULD HAVE PUT A PIECE OF STICKING PLAISTER OVER IT AND BEEN QUITE SATISFIED HE DRESSED HIMSELF ALL IN HIS BEST AND AT LAST GOT OUT INTO THE STREETS
IF YOU PLEASE SAID SCROOGE NOT A FARTHING LESS A GREAT MANY BACK PAYMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN IT I ASSURE YOU WILL YOU DO ME THAT FAVOUR MY DEAR SIR SAID THE OTHER SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO SUCH MUNIFI DON'T SAY ANYTHING PLEASE RETORTED SCROOGE

IT'S ONLY ONCE A YEAR SIR PLEADED BOB APPEARING FROM THE TANK IT SHALL NOT BE REPEATED I WAS MAKING RATHER MERRY YESTERDAY SIR NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY FRIEND SAID SCROOGE
SITTING IN AMONG THE WARES HE DEALT IN BY A CHARCOAL STOVE MADE OF OLD BRICKS WAS A GREY HAIRED RASCAL
HE PASSED THE DOOR A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE HE HAD THE COURAGE TO GO UP AND KNOCK BUT HE MADE A DASH AND DID IT IS YOUR MASTER AT HOME MY DEAR SAID SCROOGE TO THE GIRL NICE GIRL VERY
MISTER SCROOGE YES SAID SCROOGE THAT IS MY NAME AND I FEAR IT MAY NOT BE PLEASANT TO YOU ALLOW ME TO ASK YOUR PARDON AND WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS HERE SCROOGE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
WHERE SCROOGE HAD NEVER PENETRATED BEFORE ALTHOUGH HE RECOGNISED ITS SITUATION AND ITS BAD REPUTE THE WAYS WERE FOUL AND NARROW THE SHOPS AND HOUSES WRETCHED THE PEOPLE HALF NAKED DRUNKEN SLIPSHOD
YOU MUST HAVE A CAB THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE SAID THIS AND THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE PAID FOR THE TURKEY AND THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE PAID FOR THE CAB AND THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE RECOMPENSED THE BOY
FOR THESE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS ARE ALWAYS NERVOUS ON SUCH POINTS AND LIKE TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS RIGHT FRED SAID SCROOGE DEAR HEART ALIVE HOW HIS NIECE BY MARRIAGE STARTED SCROOGE HAD FORGOTTEN FOR THE MOMENT
HALLO HERE HE WAS CHECKED IN HIS TRANSPORTS BY THE CHURCHES RINGING OUT THE LUSTIEST PEALS HE HAD EVER HEARD
THEY COULD SCARCELY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANY BEARING ON THE DEATH OF JACOB HIS OLD PARTNER FOR THAT WAS PAST AND THIS GHOST'S PROVINCE WAS THE FUTURE NOR COULD HE THINK OF ANY ONE IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED WITH HIMSELF TO WHOM HE COULD APPLY THEM
AND FOUND THAT EVERYTHING COULD YIELD HIM PLEASURE HE HAD NEVER DREAMED THAT ANY WALK THAT ANYTHING COULD GIVE HIM SO MUCH HAPPINESS IN THE AFTERNOON HE TURNED HIS STEPS TOWARDS HIS NEPHEW'S HOUSE
THAT IS MY NAME AND I FEAR IT MAY NOT BE PLEASANT TO YOU ALLOW ME TO ASK YOUR PARDON AND WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS HERE SCROOGE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR LORD BLESS ME CRIED THE GENTLEMAN
SCROOGE WAS BETTER THAN HIS WORD HE DID IT ALL AND INFINITELY MORE AND TO TINY TIM WHO DID NOT DIE HE WAS A SECOND FATHER
FOR UPON MY LIFE I DON'T KNOW OF ANYBODY TO GO TO IT SUPPOSE WE MAKE UP A PARTY AND VOLUNTEER I DON'T MIND GOING IF A LUNCH IS PROVIDED OBSERVED THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE EXCRESCENCE ON HIS NOSE
THE KNOCKER CAUGHT HIS EYE I SHALL LOVE IT AS LONG AS I LIVE CRIED SCROOGE PATTING IT WITH HIS HAND I SCARCELY EVER LOOKED AT IT BEFORE WHAT AN HONEST EXPRESSION IT HAS IN ITS FACE

I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT EITHER WAY I ONLY KNOW HE'S DEAD WHEN DID HE DIE INQUIRED ANOTHER LAST NIGHT I BELIEVE WHY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
THE PHANTOM SLOWLY GRAVELY SILENTLY APPROACHED WHEN IT CAME NEAR HIM SCROOGE BENT DOWN UPON HIS KNEE FOR IN THE VERY AIR THROUGH WHICH THIS SPIRIT MOVED IT SEEMED TO SCATTER GLOOM AND MYSTERY
THERE'S THE DOOR BY WHICH THE GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY ENTERED THERE'S THE CORNER WHERE THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT SAT THERE'S THE WINDOW WHERE I SAW THE WANDERING SPIRITS IT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S ALL TRUE IT ALL HAPPENED HA HA HA REALLY
AND HE FOUND THAT HE COULD HARDLY STAND WHEN HE PREPARED TO FOLLOW IT THE SPIRIT PAUSED A MOMENT AS OBSERVING HIS CONDITION AND GIVING HIM TIME TO RECOVER BUT SCROOGE WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR THIS IT THRILLED HIM WITH A VAGUE UNCERTAIN HORROR
I AM NOT GOING TO STAND THIS SORT OF THING ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE HE CONTINUED LEAPING FROM HIS STOOL AND GIVING BOB SUCH A DIG IN THE WAISTCOAT THAT HE STAGGERED BACK INTO THE TANK AGAIN
FOR HE HAD AN EXPECTATION THAT THE CONDUCT OF HIS FUTURE SELF WOULD GIVE HIM THE CLUE HE MISSED AND WOULD RENDER THE SOLUTION OF THESE RIDDLES EASY HE LOOKED ABOUT IN THAT VERY PLACE FOR HIS OWN IMAGE BUT ANOTHER MAN STOOD IN HIS ACCUSTOMED CORNER
GHOST OF THE FUTURE HE EXCLAIMED I FEAR YOU MORE THAN ANY SPECTRE I HAVE SEEN BUT AS I KNOW YOUR PURPOSE IS TO DO ME GOOD AND AS I HOPE TO LIVE TO BE ANOTHER MAN FROM WHAT I WAS
TO MAKE AMENDS IN I WILL LIVE IN THE PAST THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE SCROOGE REPEATED AS HE SCRAMBLED OUT OF BED THE SPIRITS OF ALL THREE SHALL STRIVE WITHIN ME
REALLY FOR A MAN WHO HAD BEEN OUT OF PRACTICE FOR SO MANY YEARS IT WAS A SPLENDID LAUGH A MOST ILLUSTRIOUS LAUGH THE FATHER OF A LONG LONG LINE OF BRILLIANT LAUGHS
SCROOGE WAS BETTER THAN HIS WORD HE DID IT ALL AND INFINITELY MORE AND TO TINY TIM WHO DID NOT DIE HE WAS A SECOND FATHER HE BECAME
HE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN COMING ON TOWARDS HIM HE BEHELD THE PORTLY GENTLEMAN WHO HAD WALKED INTO HIS COUNTING HOUSE THE DAY BEFORE AND SAID SCROOGE AND MARLEY'S I BELIEVE
NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY FRIEND SAID SCROOGE I AM NOT GOING TO STAND THIS SORT OF THING ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE HE CONTINUED LEAPING FROM HIS STOOL
SCROOGE WAS AT FIRST INCLINED TO BE SURPRISED THAT THE SPIRIT SHOULD ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO CONVERSATIONS APPARENTLY SO TRIVIAL BUT FEELING ASSURED THAT THEY MUST HAVE SOME HIDDEN PURPOSE HE SET HIMSELF TO CONSIDER WHAT IT WAS LIKELY TO BE
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN AMONG THE SPIRITS I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING I'M QUITE A BABY NEVER MIND I DON'T CARE I'D RATHER BE A BABY
WHY BLESS MY SOUL CRIED FRED WHO'S THAT IT'S I YOUR UNCLE SCROOGE I HAVE COME TO DINNER WILL YOU LET ME IN FRED LET HIM IN
AS GOOD A MASTER AND AS GOOD A MAN AS THE GOOD OLD CITY KNEW OR ANY OTHER GOOD OLD CITY TOWN OR BOROUGH IN THE GOOD OLD WORLD SOME PEOPLE LAUGHED TO SEE THE ALTERATION IN HIM BUT HE LET THEM LAUGH
I AM NOT GOING TO STAND THIS SORT OF THING ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE HE CONTINUED LEAPING FROM HIS STOOL AND GIVING BOB SUCH A DIG IN THE WAISTCOAT THAT HE STAGGERED BACK INTO THE TANK AGAIN AND THEREFORE I AM ABOUT TO RAISE YOUR SALARY
HE HAD FRISKED INTO THE SITTING ROOM AND WAS NOW STANDING THERE PERFECTLY WINDED THERE'S THE SAUCEPAN THAT THE GRUEL WAS IN CRIED SCROOGE STARTING OFF AGAIN AND GOING ROUND THE FIREPLACE
THE SPIRIT STOPPED BESIDE ONE LITTLE KNOT OF BUSINESS MEN OBSERVING THAT THE HAND WAS POINTED TO THEM SCROOGE ADVANCED TO LISTEN TO THEIR TALK
HERE'S THE TURKEY HALLO WHOOP HOW ARE YOU MERRY CHRISTMAS IT WAS A TURKEY HE NEVER COULD HAVE STOOD UPON HIS LEGS THAT BIRD HE WOULD HAVE SNAPPED EM SHORT OFF IN A MINUTE LIKE STICKS OF SEALING WAX
IT'S A PLEASURE TO TALK TO HIM YES MY BUCK IT'S HANGING THERE NOW REPLIED THE BOY IS IT SAID SCROOGE GO AND BUY IT WALK ER EXCLAIMED THE BOY
AND THOUGH THE CLOCK POINTED TO HIS USUAL TIME OF DAY FOR BEING THERE HE SAW NO LIKENESS OF HIMSELF AMONG THE MULTITUDES THAT POURED IN THROUGH THE PORCH IT GAVE HIM LITTLE SURPRISE HOWEVER
YES SIR WHERE IS HE MY LOVE SAID SCROOGE HE'S IN THE DINING ROOM SIR ALONG WITH MISTRESS I'LL SHOW YOU UP STAIRS IF YOU PLEASE THANK'EE HE KNOWS ME SAID SCROOGE
YES AND THE BEDPOST WAS HIS OWN THE BED WAS HIS OWN THE ROOM WAS HIS OWN BEST AND HAPPIEST OF ALL THE TIME BEFORE HIM WAS HIS OWN
HE WAS ON HIS STOOL IN A JIFFY DRIVING AWAY WITH HIS PEN AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO OVERTAKE NINE O'CLOCK HALLO GROWLED SCROOGE IN HIS ACCUSTOMED VOICE AS NEAR AS HE COULD FEIGN IT
AS IF THE SPIRIT HAD INCLINED ITS HEAD THAT WAS THE ONLY ANSWER HE RECEIVED ALTHOUGH WELL USED TO GHOSTLY COMPANY BY THIS TIME SCROOGE FEARED THE SILENT SHAPE SO MUCH THAT HIS LEGS TREMBLED BENEATH HIM
HE HAD NO FURTHER INTERCOURSE WITH SPIRITS BUT LIVED UPON THE TOTAL ABSTINENCE PRINCIPLE EVER AFTERWARDS AND IT WAS ALWAYS SAID OF HIM THAT HE KNEW HOW TO KEEP CHRISTMAS WELL IF ANY MAN ALIVE POSSESSED THE KNOWLEDGE
SCROOGE WAS BETTER THAN HIS WORD HE DID IT ALL AND INFINITELY MORE AND TO TINY TIM WHO DID NOT DIE HE WAS A SECOND FATHER HE BECAME AS GOOD A FRIEND
LORD BLESS ME CRIED THE GENTLEMAN AS IF HIS BREATH WERE TAKEN AWAY MY DEAR MISTER SCROOGE ARE YOU SERIOUS IF YOU PLEASE SAID SCROOGE NOT A FARTHING LESS
WITH HIS HAND ALREADY ON THE DINING ROOM LOCK I'LL GO IN HERE MY DEAR HE TURNED IT GENTLY AND SIDLED HIS FACE IN ROUND THE DOOR THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE TABLE WHICH WAS SPREAD OUT IN GREAT ARRAY
PLEASE IT'S ONLY ONCE A YEAR SIR PLEADED BOB APPEARING FROM THE TANK IT SHALL NOT BE REPEATED I WAS MAKING RATHER MERRY YESTERDAY SIR NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY FRIEND SAID SCROOGE
SAID THE FIRST WITH A YAWN WHAT HAS HE DONE WITH HIS MONEY ASKED A RED FACED GENTLEMAN WITH A PENDULOUS EXCRESCENCE ON THE END OF HIS NOSE THAT SHOOK LIKE THE GILLS OF A TURKEY COCK
ABOUT HER SITTING IN THE CORNER WITH THE FOOTSTOOL OR HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ON ANY ACCOUNT WHY BLESS MY SOUL CRIED FRED WHO'S THAT IT'S I YOUR UNCLE SCROOGE I HAVE COME TO DINNER
SO DID TOPPER WHEN HE CAME SO DID THE PLUMP SISTER WHEN SHE CAME SO DID EVERY ONE WHEN THEY CAME WONDERFUL PARTY WONDERFUL GAMES WONDERFUL UNANIMITY WON DER FUL HAPPINESS
SECRETS THAT FEW WOULD LIKE TO SCRUTINISE WERE BRED AND HIDDEN IN MOUNTAINS OF UNSEEMLY RAGS MASSES OF CORRUPTED FAT
AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE KITCHENS OF HOUSES AND UP TO THE WINDOWS AND FOUND THAT EVERYTHING COULD YIELD HIM PLEASURE HE HAD NEVER DREAMED THAT ANY WALK THAT ANYTHING COULD GIVE HIM SO MUCH HAPPINESS IN THE AFTERNOON
BUT I'LL OFFER TO GO IF ANYBODY ELSE WILL WHEN I COME TO THINK OF IT I'M NOT AT ALL SURE THAT I WASN'T HIS MOST PARTICULAR FRIEND FOR WE USED TO STOP AND SPEAK WHENEVER WE MET BYE BYE
THERE'S THE WINDOW WHERE I SAW THE WANDERING SPIRITS IT'S ALL RIGHT
ELIZA BELL HAD SET FIRE TO HER AUNT'S CARDED ROLLS ASKED IF SHE MEANT TO DO IT SHE SAID NOT ALTOGETHER
WORSE AND THEN THERE ARE THE TWINS SOMEHOW I DON'T BELIEVE THEIR UNCLE WILL EVER REALLY SEND FOR THEM PERHAPS COLLEGE MAY BE AROUND THE BEND IN THE ROAD BUT I HAVEN'T GOT TO THE BEND YET AND I DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT IT LEST I MIGHT GROW DISCONTENTED
IT WAS BECAUSE JIMMY CALLED HIM SAINT CLAIR THAT SAINT CLAIR POUNDED HIM ON THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL I HEARD OF THE POUNDING BUT NOT OFFICIALLY SO I DON'T THINK I'LL TAKE ANY NOTICE OF IT YESTERDAY I WAS TRYING TO TEACH LOTTIE WRIGHT TO DO ADDITION I SAID
BEGAN PAINTING THE NEXT DAY HE WAS NOT DISTURBED IN HIS TASK THE HALL WAS SITUATED ON WHAT WAS CALLED THE LOWER ROAD IN LATE AUTUMN THIS ROAD WAS ALWAYS MUDDY AND WET AND PEOPLE GOING TO CARMODY TRAVELED BY THE LONGER UPPER ROAD
I THOUGHT I'D WAIT FOR YOU TEACHER BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO THE GRAVEYARD HE SAID SLIPPING HIS HAND INTO HERS I'M GOING THERE TOO I'M TAKING THIS BOUQUET OF GERANIUMS TO PUT ON GRANDPA IRVING'S GRAVE FOR GRANDMA
SHE HAS GOLDEN HAIR RIGHT DOWN TO HER FEET AND HER DRESS IS ALL GLITTERING AND GLISTENING LIKE GOLD THAT IS ALIVE AND SHE HAS A GOLDEN HARP AND PLAYS ON IT ALL DAY LONG YOU CAN HEAR THE MUSIC ANY TIME ALONG SHORE IF YOU LISTEN CAREFULLY
SHE WAS AND NEVER ASKED ANYBODY ANYTHING ABOUT HER AND NOW EVERYTHING HAS COME RIGHT AND I HAD A HAND IN BRINGING IT ABOUT PERHAPS AS MISSUS LYNDE SAYS
OH DEAR THIS IS A DREADFUL PREDICAMENT I WOULDN'T MIND MY MISFORTUNES SO MUCH IF THEY WERE ROMANTIC AS MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES ALWAYS ARE
WHEN YOU HAD NOT COME INTO MY LIFE TO BLESS AND HALLOW IT I WILL ALWAYS LOOK BACK TO THIS YEAR AS THE MOST WONDERFUL IN MY LIFE BECAUSE IT BROUGHT YOU TO ME BESIDES IT'S THE YEAR WE MOVED TO AVONLEA FROM NEWBRIDGE MY LOVE FOR YOU HAS MADE MY LIFE VERY RICH
SHE TURNED HER HEAD AT DAVY'S QUESTION AND ANSWERED DREAMILY OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON DOWN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW PAUL IRVING WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE MEANING OF THIS OR MADE A MEANING OUT OF IT FOR HIMSELF IF HE DIDN'T
SHE SAT DOWN AT HER DESK FEELING ASHAMED REPENTANT AND BITTERLY MORTIFIED HER QUICK ANGER WAS GONE AND SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEEK RELIEF IN TEARS SO ALL HER BOASTS HAD COME TO THIS SHE HAD ACTUALLY WHIPPED ONE OF HER PUPILS
I PUT TEACHER WHERE HE PUT LADY AND I PUT IN SOMETHING OF MY OWN WHEN I COULD THINK OF IT AND I CHANGED SOME WORDS I PUT DRESS IN PLACE OF MOOD
TEXT COMMENT AND APPLICATION INTO SIX WORDS AND THROW IT AT YOU LIKE A BRICK ANNE WHO WAS PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF THE VERANDA ENJOYING THE CHARM OF A MILD WEST WIND BLOWING ACROSS A NEWLY PLOUGHED FIELD ON A GRAY NOVEMBER TWILIGHT
NO WE MUST JUST WAIT UNTIL THE COPP GIRLS COME HOME AND BIND THEM TO SECRECY THEY'LL KNOW WHERE THE AXE IS AND GET ME OUT I'M NOT UNCOMFORTABLE AS LONG AS I KEEP PERFECTLY STILL NOT UNCOMFORTABLE IN BODY I MEAN
I MUST I HAVE SOME SEWING TO DO FOR DORA THIS EVENING BESIDES DAVY IS PROBABLY BREAKING MARILLA'S HEART WITH SOME NEW MISCHIEF BY THIS TIME THIS MORNING THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS WHERE DOES THE DARK GO ANNE I WANT TO KNOW
SHE DROPPED THE KEY INTO HER POCKET WITH A SIGH OF SATISFACTION THE SCHOOL YEAR WAS ENDED SHE HAD BEEN REENGAGED FOR THE NEXT WITH MANY EXPRESSIONS OF SATISFACTION ONLY MISTER HARMON ANDREWS TOLD HER SHE OUGHT TO USE THE STRAP OFTENER
BUT EVEN SO IT'S NICE TO THINK ONE WAS AN INSTRUMENT USED BY PREDESTINATION YES INDEED IT'S VERY ROMANTIC I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S SO TERRIBLY ROMANTIC AT ALL SAID MARILLA RATHER CRISPLY
PAUL HAD TALKED SO MUCH TO ANNE ABOUT HIS MOTHER AND FATHER THAT SHE FELT AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN THEM SHE THOUGHT HIS MOTHER MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIKE WHAT HE WAS HIMSELF IN TEMPERAMENT AND DISPOSITION AND SHE HAD AN IDEA THAT STEPHEN IRVING
SHE MADE FREQUENT TRIPS TO THE GATE AND LOOKED AS ANXIOUSLY DOWN THE LANE AS EVER HER NAMESAKE IN THE BLUEBEARD STORY PEERED FROM THE TOWER CASEMENT SUPPOSE THEY DON'T COME AT ALL SHE SAID PITEOUSLY DON'T SUPPOSE IT
SAID ANNE VERY SOFTLY YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT TO STOP HURTING YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO FORGET YOUR LITTLE MOTHER EVEN IF YOU COULD NO INDEED I WOULDN'T THAT'S JUST THE WAY I FEEL YOU'RE SO GOOD AT UNDERSTANDING TEACHER
WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU GO TO COLLEGE ANNE BUT IF YOU NEVER DO DON'T BE DISCONTENTED ABOUT IT WE MAKE OUR OWN LIVES WHEREVER WE ARE AFTER ALL
WITH ALL THE ZEST GONE OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL BE ABLE TO EAT A MOUTHFUL SAID DIANA DOLEFULLY NOR I
I KISS YOUR HANDS AND FACE MY SWEET MAY GOD WATCH OVER YOU AND PROTECT YOU FROM ALL HARM YOUR AFECKSIONATE PUPIL ANNETTA BELL THIS EXTRAORDINARY LETTER PUZZLED ME NOT A LITTLE
WHICH THE WORLD CANNOT BESTOW OR TAKE AWAY OF LOOKING AT LIFE THROUGH SOME TRANSFIGURING OR REVEALING MEDIUM
SAID MARILLA WHO HAD LISTENED TO THIS DIALOGUE WITH A RATHER GUILTY EXPRESSION I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D REMEMBER ABOUT THE SUGAR ANNE FOR I'M PERFECTLY CERTAIN YOU NEVER DID BEFORE SO I PUT IN A SPOONFUL
FINISHING UP WITH A GRAND SMASH AT THE BOTTOM EVERYBODY RAN OUT INTO THE HALL
SO WE'LL HAVE DINNER AT ONE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN TWO HAPPIER AND MORE EXCITED GIRLS SOMEWHERE IN CANADA OR THE UNITED STATES AT THAT MOMENT BUT I DOUBT IT EVERY SNIP OF THE SCISSORS AS ROSE AND PEONY AND BLUEBELL FELL
IF YOU MEAN ECONOMICAL IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING FROM BEING STINGY IT IS AN EXCELLENT TRAIT IN A PERSON IF SHE IS ECONOMICAL IF MARILLA HAD BEEN STINGY SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN YOU AND DORA WHEN YOUR MOTHER DIED
I REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR MISTER HARRISON
SAID THEY WOULDN'T GIVE A CENT UNLESS JOSHUA GOT IT THEY HAD SUBSCRIBED TWELVE DOLLARS BETWEEN THEM AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO MUCH TO LOSE ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN TO THE PYES MISSUS LYNDE SAYS THEY TRY TO RUN EVERYTHING
ADVISED DIANA AND ANNE ACCORDINGLY LEANED MUCH TO HER DELIGHT SHE SAW AS SHE PEERED THROUGH THE PANE A WILLOW WARE PLATTER EXACTLY SUCH AS SHE WAS IN QUEST OF ON THE SHELF IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW
SHE SAID AS SHE GINGERLY STEPPED ON THE ROOF
AIN'T MISTER IRVING SPLENDID HE JUST WORSHIPS THE GROUND SHE TREADS ON AND IT MAKES ME FEEL SO QUEER SOMETIMES TO SEE THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE'S WATCHING HER IT BEGGARS DESCRIPTION MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM I'M AWFUL THANKFUL THEY'RE SO FOND OF EACH OTHER IT'S THE BEST WAY WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE
BUT A SUDDEN OUTFLASHING OF GOOD COMRADESHIP ANTHONY SMILED NO IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD ANTHONY GRINNED BACK A GRIN IS NOT GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A RESPECTFUL THING
ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD HOPELESSLY NO THE SPLINTERS HURT TOO BADLY IF YOU CAN FIND AN AXE YOU MIGHT CHOP ME OUT THOUGH OH DEAR I DO REALLY BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT I WAS BORN UNDER AN ILL OMENED STAR DIANA SEARCHED FAITHFULLY
BUT NO AXE WAS TO BE FOUND I'LL HAVE TO GO FOR HELP SHE SAID RETURNING TO THE PRISONER NO INDEED YOU WON'T SAID ANNE VEHEMENTLY IF YOU DO THE STORY OF THIS WILL GET OUT EVERYWHERE AND I SHALL BE ASHAMED TO SHOW MY FACE
AND WAS ALL SYMPATHY OUTWARDLY NEVER MIND ANNE MOST PAINTS FADE UGLIER EVERY YEAR BUT THAT BLUE IS AS UGLY AS IT CAN BE TO BEGIN WITH SO IT'S BOUND TO FADE PRETTIER AND THE ROOF IS SHINGLED AND PAINTED ALL RIGHT
I KNEW I COULD TRUST FATHER TO PICK ME OUT A NICE LITTLE SECOND MOTHER HE SAID PROUDLY IT'S A FINE THING TO HAVE A FATHER YOU CAN DEPEND ON TEACHER I JUST LOVE MISS LAVENDAR GRANDMA IS PLEASED TOO SHE SAYS SHE'S REAL GLAD FATHER DIDN'T PICK OUT AN AMERICAN FOR HIS SECOND WIFE BECAUSE
WHERE'S DAVY SAID MARILLA WITH AN INDIFFERENT GLANCE AT THE STAR IN BED
THEY ARE BROAD OR NARROW ACCORDING TO WHAT WE PUT INTO THEM NOT WHAT WE GET OUT LIFE IS RICH AND FULL HERE EVERYWHERE IF WE CAN ONLY LEARN HOW TO OPEN OUR WHOLE HEARTS TO ITS RICHNESS AND FULNESS
FOR IT HAS TRULY BEEN A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE A GOOD MANY MORE AND WORSE DISAPPOINTMENTS THAN THAT BEFORE YOU GET THROUGH LIFE
BELIEVE YOU'RE JUST TALKING NONSENSE
YOU KNOW TEACHER I WISH SHE WOULD LEAVE THE LAMP IN MY ROOM TILL I GO TO SLEEP THOUGH SHE TAKES IT RIGHT OUT AS SOON AS SHE TUCKS ME UP BECAUSE SHE SAYS I MUSTN'T BE A COWARD I'M NOT SCARED BUT I'D RATHER HAVE THE LIGHT
YOUR KINDNESS WON HIS LOVE AFTER THE IDEA THAT A GIRL WAS NO GOOD WAS ROOTED OUT OF HIS STUBBORN MIND HE MAY HAVE DESERVED IT BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT IF I HAD CALMLY AND DELIBERATELY DECIDED TO WHIP HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT A JUST PUNISHMENT FOR HIM
I NEVER WAS MUCH OF A TALKER TILL I CAME TO AVONLEA AND THEN I HAD TO BEGIN IN SELF DEFENSE OR MISSUS LYNDE WOULD HAVE SAID I WAS DUMB AND STARTED A SUBSCRIPTION TO HAVE ME TAUGHT SIGN LANGUAGE
A MOONGLADE IS THE TRACK THE FULL MOON MAKES ON THE WATER WHEN IT IS RISING FROM THE SEA YOU KNOW TEACHER WELL THE YOUNGEST TWIN SAILOR SAILED ALONG THE MOONGLADE TILL HE CAME RIGHT UP TO THE MOON
HELD A SHEAF OF BLUEBELLS THE DARK CORNERS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE GRATE WERE LIGHTED UP WITH JARS FULL OF GLOWING CRIMSON PEONIES AND THE GRATE ITSELF WAS AFLAME WITH YELLOW POPPIES
YOU LOOK SIMPLY SWEET SAID ANNE ADMIRINGLY DIANA SIGHED
BECAUSE IT WOULD RAIN THE NEXT DAY IT'S SO HARD NOT TO LAUGH STELLA I HAVE TO SAVE UP ALL MY AMUSEMENT UNTIL I GET HOME AND MARILLA SAYS IT MAKES HER NERVOUS TO HEAR WILD SHRIEKS OF MIRTH PROCEEDING FROM THE EAST GABLE WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE
MISTER HARRISON SAYS HIS PASTURES ARE SO SCORCHED UP THAT HIS POOR COWS CAN HARDLY GET A BITE TO EAT AND HE FEELS GUILTY OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS EVERY TIME HE MEETS THEIR EYES AFTER A WEARISOME DRIVE
JOE SLOANE STOOD AS ONE TRANSFIXED IN THE MIDST OF THE COMMOTION AND SAINT CLAIR HELPLESS WITH LAUGHTER ROCKED TO AND FRO IN THE AISLE PRILLIE ROGERSON FAINTED AND ANNETTA BELL WENT INTO HYSTERICS
I SET THAT PLATTER THERE AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT I AM PROPERLY PUNISHED FOR MY CARELESSNESS BUT OH WHAT WILL MISS BARRY SAY WELL YOU KNOW SHE ONLY BOUGHT IT SO IT ISN'T THE SAME AS IF IT WAS AN HEIRLOOM
FOR ONE THING MISSUS MORGAN IS COMING TO THE ISLAND IN JULY AND PRISCILLA IS GOING TO BRING HER UP I FEEL ONE OF MY OLD THRILLS AT THE MERE THOUGHT I HOPE YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME ANNE
ANTHONY PYE STRUTTED TO HIS WITH HIS USUAL IMPERTINENT SWAGGER AND SHE SAW HIM WHISPER SOMETHING TO HIS SEAT MATE AND THEN GLANCE AT HER WITH A GRIN NEVER SO IT SEEMED TO ANNE HAD THERE BEEN SO MANY SQUEAKY PENCILS AS THERE WERE THAT MORNING
SPREAD THE WRAPPING PAPER ON A SHINGLE DIANA HANDED UP AND WROTE OUT HER GARDEN IDYL UNDER CONDITIONS THAT COULD HARDLY BE CONSIDERED AS FAVORABLE TO LITERATURE NEVERTHELESS THE RESULT WAS QUITE PRETTY AND DIANA WAS ENRAPTURED WHEN ANNE READ IT TO HER OH
I OWE THIS ALL TO YOU MY SWEETEST TEACHER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HOW SWEET YOU LOOKED THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU IN THAT BLACK DRESS WITH FLOWERS IN YOUR HAIR I SHALL SEE YOU LIKE THAT FOR EVER EVEN WHEN WE ARE BOTH OLD AND GRAY YOU WILL ALWAYS BE YOUNG AND FAIR TO ME DEAREST TEACHER
ANNE SURRENDERED HER BOOKS AND WONDERED IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY BE AWAKE ANTHONY WALKED ON IN SILENCE TO THE SCHOOL BUT WHEN ANNE TOOK HER BOOKS SHE SMILED DOWN AT HIM NOT THE STEREOTYPED KIND SMILE SHE HAD SO PERSISTENTLY ASSUMED FOR HIS BENEFIT
WELL LET'S FORGET OUR TROUBLES AND THINK OF OUR MERCIES SAID ANNE GAILY MISSUS ALLAN SAYS THAT WHENEVER WE THINK OF ANYTHING THAT IS A TRIAL TO US WE SHOULD ALSO THINK OF SOMETHING NICE THAT WE CAN SET OVER AGAINST IT IF YOU ARE SLIGHTLY TOO PLUMP
APPARELLED IN CELESTIAL LIGHT WEARING A GLORY AND A FRESHNESS NOT VISIBLE TO THOSE WHO LIKE HERSELF AND CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH LOOKED AT THINGS ONLY THROUGH PROSE WHEN'S THE WEDDING TO BE SHE ASKED AFTER A PAUSE THE LAST WEDNESDAY IN AUGUST
BUT IF SHE IS DETERMINED TO HAVE HER FEELINGS HURT IT CAN'T BE HELPED IF I WERE TO GO TO THE SHORE SOME NIGHT WITH YOU DO YOU THINK I COULD SEE YOUR ROCK PEOPLE TOO PAUL SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY NO I DON'T THINK YOU COULD SEE MY ROCK PEOPLE
IT NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS THE MEASURE OF THAT DAY'S TRIBULATIONS WAS NOT YET FULL JUST AS MISTER ALLAN HAD FINISHED RETURNING THANKS THERE AROSE A STRANGE OMINOUS SOUND ON THE STAIRS AS OF SOME HARD HEAVY OBJECT BOUNDING FROM STEP TO STEP
I HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SET OF THEORIES YOU EVER KNEW WHEN I STARTED OUT AS A SCHOOLMA'AM BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS FAILED ME AT SOME PINCH OR ANOTHER EVEN THE THEORY ON CORPORAL PUNISHMENT TEASED MISSUS ALLAN BUT ANNE FLUSHED
TO BE SURE THE IMPROVERS HAD AN EYE ON IT AND PRISCILLA GRANT HAD READ A PAPER ON CEMETERIES BEFORE THE LAST MEETING OF THE SOCIETY
THAT ALL DEPENDS ON WHO YOU'RE ENGAGED TO ANSWERED DIANA WITH THAT
IT HAD LOST SOME OF ITS BLOOM AND YOUTHFUL CURVES AND THERE WERE FINE PATIENT LINES ABOUT EYES AND MOUTH A TINY GRAVE IN THAT VERY CEMETERY ACCOUNTED FOR SOME OF THEM AND SOME NEW ONES HAD COME DURING THE RECENT ILLNESS
THE OLDEST TWIN CAME SAILING OVER THE SEA IN AN ENCHANTED BOAT AND I GOT IN HER THE BOAT WAS ALL PEARLY AND RAINBOWY LIKE THE INSIDE OF THE MUSSEL SHELLS AND HER SAIL WAS LIKE MOONSHINE WELL WE SAILED RIGHT ACROSS TO THE SUNSET
NORA WAS THE FIRST ONE OF THEM I GOT ACQUAINTED WITH AND SO I THINK I LOVE HER THE BEST SHE LIVES IN ANDREWS COVE AND SHE HAS BLACK HAIR AND BLACK EYES AND SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE MERMAIDS AND THE WATER KELPIES YOU OUGHT TO HEAR THE STORIES SHE CAN TELL
I THINK HE ONLY PUT IT ON BECAUSE HE WANTED TO CONCLUDE A BUSINESS DEAL WITH HARMON ANDREWS SAID ANNE I'VE HEARD HIM SAY THAT'S THE ONLY TIME A MAN NEEDS TO BE PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE BECAUSE IF HE LOOKS PROSPEROUS THE PARTY OF THE SECOND PART WON'T BE SO LIKELY TO TRY TO CHEAT HIM
OH MARILLA I HAVE TRIED SO HARD TO BE PATIENT AND TO WIN ANTHONY'S LIKING AND NOW IT HAS ALL GONE FOR NOTHING MARILLA PASSED HER HARD WORK WORN HAND OVER THE GIRL'S GLOSSY TUMBLED HAIR WITH A WONDERFUL TENDERNESS
AND NOT SIT LIKE A MUTE SAID DIANA ANXIOUSLY ALL MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES CONVERSE SO BEAUTIFULLY BUT I'M AFRAID I'LL BE TONGUE TIED AND STUPID AND I'LL BE SURE TO SAY I SEEN I HAVEN'T OFTEN SAID IT SINCE MISS STACY TAUGHT HERE
AND NEVER SULLY IT BY ANY FAILURE IN TRUTH AND SINCERITY I FEAR THE NAME OF FRIENDSHIP IS OFTEN DEGRADED TO A KIND OF INTIMACY THAT HAS NOTHING OF REAL FRIENDSHIP IN IT YES LIKE GERTIE PYE'S AND JULIA BELL'S
THE SHADE THEY USE FOR PAINTING CARTS AND WHEELBARROWS AND MISSUS LYNDE SAYS IT IS THE MOST HIDEOUS COLOR FOR A BUILDING ESPECIALLY WHEN COMBINED WITH A RED ROOF THAT SHE EVER SAW OR IMAGINED YOU COULD SIMPLY HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH A FEATHER WHEN I HEARD IT
IT SEEMS TO ME ANNE THAT YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO OUTGROW YOUR FASHION OF SETTING YOUR HEART SO ON THINGS AND THEN CRASHING DOWN INTO DESPAIR BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET THEM I KNOW I'M TOO MUCH INCLINED THAT WAY AGREED ANNE RUEFULLY
DOES THE OLDEST TWIN STILL CONTINUE TO BEHAVE HIMSELF HE HAS TO SAID PAUL EMPHATICALLY HE KNOWS I WON'T ASSOCIATE WITH HIM IF HE DOESN'T HE IS REALLY FULL OF WICKEDNESS I THINK AND HAS NORA FOUND OUT ABOUT THE GOLDEN LADY YET
HOME FOR HIS VACATION TOO I SUPPOSE HOW ARE YOU AND HE GETTING ON WITH YOUR STUDIES PRETTY WELL WE PLAN TO FINISH THE VIRGIL TONIGHT THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY LINES TO DO THEN WE ARE NOT GOING TO STUDY ANY MORE UNTIL SEPTEMBER
MOST PEOPLE GAVE VERY LIBERALLY MISTER HARRISON ANNE WAS A SWEET SOULED LASS BUT SHE COULD INSTILL SOME VENOM INTO INNOCENT ITALICS WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED WHAT COLOR ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE IT WE HAVE DECIDED ON A VERY PRETTY GREEN
BUT THREE YEARS ISN'T ANY TOO MUCH TIME TO GET READY FOR HOUSEKEEPING FOR I HAVEN'T A SPECK OF FANCY WORK MADE YET BUT I'M GOING TO BEGIN CROCHETING DOILIES TOMORROW
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE ANY HARM NO I DON'T THINK SO DECIDED ANNE AFTER DUE REFLECTION SINCE OUR MOTIVE IS NOT IDLE CURIOSITY THIS IMPORTANT POINT OF ETHICS BEING SETTLED ANNE PREPARED TO MOUNT THE AFORESAID LITTLE HOUSE
IT'S HEARTBREAKING AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE WE'VE HAD HOW ON EARTH COULD SUCH A MISTAKE HAVE HAPPENED WAILED DIANA THE BLAME OF THIS UNMERCIFUL DISASTER WAS EVENTUALLY NARROWED DOWN TO THE PYES THE IMPROVERS HAD DECIDED TO USE MORTON HARRIS PAINTS
SHE PROMPTLY AGREED TO GIVE TWENTY FIVE AND MISS SARAH LOOKED AS IF SHE FELT SORRY SHE HADN'T ASKED FOR THIRTY WELL I GUESS YOU MAY HAVE IT I WANT ALL THE MONEY I CAN SCARE UP JUST NOW THE FACT IS
AS IF SOMEHOW DIANA HAD GONE FORWARD INTO A NEW WORLD SHUTTING A GATE BEHIND HER LEAVING ANNE ON THE OUTSIDE THINGS ARE CHANGING SO FAST IT ALMOST FRIGHTENS ME ANNE THOUGHT A LITTLE SADLY AND I'M AFRAID
I'LL GO RIGHT OVER TO SPENCERVALE AFTER IT TOMORROW SAID ANNE RESOLUTELY AND YOU MUST COME WITH ME IT WILL BE SUCH A WEIGHT OFF MY MIND FOR I HAVE TO GO TO TOWN DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND HOW CAN I FACE YOUR AUNT JOSEPHINE WITHOUT A WILLOW WARE PLATTER
AT SOME FUTURE TIME THE IMPROVERS MEANT TO HAVE THE LICHENED WAYWARD OLD BOARD FENCE REPLACED BY A NEAT WIRE RAILING THE GRASS MOWN AND THE LEANING MONUMENTS STRAIGHTENED UP
ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD OH NO IT WOULDN'T BE SUITABLE AT ALL THERE IS NO PLOT IN IT YOU SEE IT'S JUST A STRING OF FANCIES I LIKE WRITING SUCH THINGS BUT OF COURSE NOTHING OF THE SORT WOULD EVER DO FOR PUBLICATION
AND OH ANNE DEAR
FINALLY THE GIRLS CAME TO THE OLD COPP HOMESTEAD A PLACE OF SUCH EXCEEDING EXTERNAL NEATNESS THAT EVEN GREEN GABLES WOULD HAVE SUFFERED BY CONTRAST THE HOUSE WAS A VERY OLD FASHIONED ONE SITUATED ON A SLOPE
I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN SAID ANNE THOUGHTFULLY AND I KNOW I HAVE SO MUCH TO FEEL THANKFUL FOR OH SO MUCH MY WORK AND PAUL IRVING AND THE DEAR TWINS AND ALL MY FRIENDS
EVERY MORN IS THE WORLD MADE NEW SANG ANNE AS SHE DRESSED OWING TO THE SNOW SHE HAD TO GO AROUND BY THE ROAD TO SCHOOL AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPISH COINCIDENCE THAT ANTHONY PYE SHOULD COME PLOUGHING ALONG JUST AS SHE LEFT THE GREEN GABLES LANE
BANISH GILBERT'S IMAGE FROM HER CASTLE IN SPAIN BUT SOMEHOW HE WENT ON BEING THERE SO ANNE BEING IN A HURRY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT AND PURSUED HER AERIAL ARCHITECTURE WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT HER HOME O'DREAMS WAS BUILT AND FURNISHED BEFORE DIANA SPOKE AGAIN
ALL AVONLEA KNEW THAT OLD MISSUS IRVING WAS BRINGING HER GRANDSON UP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GOOD OLD FASHIONED METHODS OF DIET AND MORALS LET US HOPE NOT DEAR SHE SAID CHEERFULLY HOW ARE YOUR ROCK PEOPLE COMING ON
IF BOTH WERE EQUALLY OLD AND GENUINE MARILLA LOOK AT THAT BIG STAR OVER MISTER HARRISON'S MAPLE GROVE WITH ALL THAT HOLY HUSH OF SILVERY SKY ABOUT IT IT GIVES ME A FEELING THAT IS LIKE A PRAYER AFTER ALL WHEN ONE CAN SEE STARS AND SKIES LIKE THAT
SHE CARRIED THE PLATTER CAREFULLY TO THE FRONT DOOR WHERE HER GUESTS WERE ENJOYING THE COOL BREEZE THAT BLEW UP FROM THE BROOK IT WAS EXAMINED AND ADMIRED THEN JUST AS ANNE HAD TAKEN IT BACK INTO HER OWN HANDS A TERRIFIC CRASH AND CLATTER SOUNDED FROM THE KITCHEN PANTRY
IT'S PERFECTLY LOVELY TO BE ENGAGED TO FRED
I'VE LIVED HERE FOR SIXTY YEARS AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ON THE POND YET WELL IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND SAID ANNE ROGUISHLY SUPPOSE YOU COME WITH US TOMORROW WE'LL SHUT GREEN GABLES UP AND SPEND THE WHOLE DAY AT THE SHORE DAFFING THE WORLD ASIDE
SHE WENT TO SCHOOL IN NO ANGELIC MOOD HER CHEEK WAS SWOLLEN AND HER FACE ACHED THE SCHOOLROOM WAS COLD AND SMOKY FOR THE FIRE REFUSED TO BURN AND THE CHILDREN WERE HUDDLED ABOUT IT IN SHIVERING GROUPS
YOU'VE GOT THE DEAREST DIMPLES AND IF I HAVE A FRECKLED NOSE THE SHAPE OF IT IS ALL RIGHT
AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE HAD CRASHED THROUGH THE ROOF UP TO HER ARMPITS AND THERE SHE HUNG QUITE UNABLE TO EXTRICATE HERSELF DIANA DASHED INTO THE DUCK HOUSE AND SEIZING HER UNFORTUNATE FRIEND BY THE WAIST
FOR MARTHA COPP HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO KEEP ANYTHING SHE COULD SELL BUT IF THEY WON'T THERE'S A PLATTER AT WESLEY KEYSON'S AT SPENCERVALE AND SHE KNOWS THEY'D SELL IT BUT SHE ISN'T SURE IT'S JUST THE SAME KIND AS AUNT JOSEPHINE'S
I DON'T BELIEVE MISTER HARRISON WILL EVER MARRY HE SEEMS TO HAVE A PREJUDICE AGAINST MARRIAGE WELL YOU CAN NEVER TELL ABOUT THOSE OLD BACHELORS AND IF HE HAD A WHITE COLLAR ON I'D AGREE WITH RACHEL THAT IT LOOKS SUSPICIOUS
AND WHEN BARBARA SHAW CAME UP TO THE DESK WITH A SUM SHE TRIPPED OVER THE COAL SCUTTLE WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS THE COAL ROLLED TO EVERY PART OF THE ROOM HER SLATE WAS BROKEN INTO FRAGMENTS AND WHEN SHE PICKED HERSELF UP HER FACE STAINED WITH COAL DUST SENT THE BOYS INTO ROARS OF LAUGHTER
THERE'S NOT MUCH COMFORT FOR THE REST OF US IN THAT SEEING THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE FRED LAUGHED ANNE OH ANNE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID DIANA IN VEXATION I DIDN'T MEAN THAT IT'S SO HARD TO EXPLAIN
HAD BEEN BADLY USED MISSUS LYNDE TOLD THEM TO KEEP ON AND SHOW THE PYES THAT THERE REALLY WERE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO COULD DO THINGS WITHOUT MAKING A MUDDLE OF THEM MISTER MAJOR SPENCER SENT THEM WORD THAT HE WOULD CLEAN OUT ALL THE STUMPS ALONG THE ROAD FRONT OF HIS FARM AND SEED IT DOWN WITH GRASS AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
NOBODY OBJECTED TO THIS AT HALF PAST ELEVEN THE LETTUCE SALAD WAS MADE THE GOLDEN CIRCLES OF THE PIES WERE HEAPED WITH WHIPPED CREAM AND EVERYTHING WAS SIZZLING AND BUBBLING THAT OUGHT TO SIZZLE AND BUBBLE WE'D BETTER GO AND DRESS NOW SAID ANNE FOR THEY MAY BE HERE BY TWELVE
ANNE HAD NO SOONER UTTERED THE PHRASE HOME O'DREAMS THAN IT CAPTIVATED HER FANCY AND SHE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THE ERECTION OF ONE OF HER OWN IT WAS OF COURSE TENANTED BY AN IDEAL MASTER DARK PROUD AND MELANCHOLY
HANNAH BELL WANTED TO BE GOOD WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE ANY TROUBLE ABOUT IT MARJORY WHITE AGED TEN WANTED TO BE A WIDOW QUESTIONED WHY SHE GRAVELY SAID THAT IF YOU WEREN'T MARRIED PEOPLE CALLED YOU AN OLD MAID AND IF YOU WERE YOUR HUSBAND BOSSED YOU
I LOVE YOU WITH MY WHOLE HEART AND SOUL AND MIND WITH ALL THERE IS OF ME TO LOVE AND I WANT TO SERVE YOU FOR EVER IT WOULD BE MY HIGHEST PRIVILEGE THAT IS WHY I TRY SO HARD TO BE GOOD IN SCHOOL AND LEARN MY LESSUNS YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL MY TEACHER
AND DIANA HAVING MADE A HASTY PILGRIMAGE AROUND THE HOUSE RETURNED TO ANNOUNCE THAT A VERY BLACK CLOUD WAS RISING RAPIDLY IN THE NORTHWEST I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HEAVY THUNDER SHOWER SHE EXCLAIMED IN DISMAY
AND SHE WAS RIGHT AS SHE ALWAYS IS DIANA UNTIED THE PONY AND DROVE INTO THE SHED JUST AS THE FIRST HEAVY DROPS OF RAIN FELL THERE SHE SAT AND WATCHED THE RESULTING DOWNPOUR WHICH WAS SO THICK AND HEAVY
FOR EDITORS INSIST ON PLOTS SO PRISCILLA SAYS OH THERE'S MISS SARAH COPP NOW PLEASE DIANA GO AND EXPLAIN MISS SARAH COPP WAS A SMALL PERSON
AND I MEAN TO TELL YOU ABOUT THEM I HAVE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY ABOUT THEM EXCEPT GRANDMA AND FATHER BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THINGS THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THINGS SO THERE IS NO USE IN TELLING THEM
AND THERE WAS THE RAPTURE AND WRETCHEDNESS OF CHOOSING FASHIONS AND BEING FITTED ANNE AND DIANA SPENT HALF THEIR TIME AT ECHO LODGE AND THERE WERE NIGHTS WHEN ANNE COULD NOT SLEEP FOR WONDERING WHETHER SHE HAD DONE RIGHT IN ADVISING MISS LAVENDAR TO SELECT BROWN RATHER THAN NAVY BLUE FOR HER TRAVELING DRESS
SAID DIANA TRYING TO CONSOLE THE GUESTS WENT AWAY SOON AFTER FEELING THAT IT WAS THE MOST TACTFUL THING TO DO AND ANNE AND DIANA WASHED THE DISHES TALKING LESS THAN THEY HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO DO BEFORE THEN DIANA WENT HOME WITH A HEADACHE
FORTUNATELY FOR ANNE MARILLA CALLED OUT AT THIS MOMENT FROM HER ROOM ANNE DIANA'S SIGNALING AT A GREAT RATE YOU'D BETTER SEE WHAT SHE WANTS ANNE RAN TO THE EAST GABLE
DAVY SLIPPED AND CAME SPRAWLING SQUARELY DOWN ON THE LEMON PIES HIS CLEAN BLOUSE WAS RUINED FOR THAT TIME AND THE PIES FOR ALL TIME IT IS HOWEVER AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NOBODY GOOD
THAT SHE COULD HARDLY SEE ANNE THROUGH IT HOLDING THE PARASOL BRAVELY OVER HER BARE HEAD THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF THUNDER BUT FOR THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR THE RAIN CAME MERRILY DOWN OCCASIONALLY
BUT SHE WAS VERY BRAVE EMERSON GILLIS SAYS IF SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A DOG SHE WASN'T ANY BRAVER THAN IF IT REALLY WAS A DOG BUT EMERSON IS JEALOUS BECAUSE HE HASN'T GOT A BRAVE AUNT HIMSELF NOTHING BUT UNCLES I HAVE KEPT THE BEST FOR THE LAST
AND IT SOUNDS THE DEATH KNELL OF OUR SOCIETY WE'LL SIMPLY BE LAUGHED OUT OF EXISTENCE IN LIFE AS IN DREAMS HOWEVER THINGS OFTEN GO BY CONTRARIES THE AVONLEA PEOPLE DID NOT LAUGH THEY WERE TOO ANGRY
THE EVENING BEFORE SHE HAD MADE A PILGRIMAGE BACK TO THE LITTLE DESERTED GARDEN IN THE WOODS AND BROUGHT THEREFROM SOME OF HESTER'S OWN WHITE ROSES I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE THEM BETTER THAN ANY OTHERS DEAR SHE SAID SOFTLY
LET'S CARRY THE THINGS IN AND GET IT OVER IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THAT DINNER WAS A NOTABLE SUCCESS SOCIALLY THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY EXERTED THEMSELVES TO SAVE THE SITUATION AND MARILLA'S CUSTOMARY PLACIDITY WAS NOT NOTICEABLY RUFFLED
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT FOR GIRLS I S'POSE BUT I WANT SOMETHING EXCITING LOTS OF KILLING AND SHOOTING IN IT
MARILLA GLANCED AT THE RADIANT YOUNG FACE AND REFRAINED FROM FURTHER SARCASTIC COMMENTS PERHAPS SOME REALIZATION CAME TO HER THAT AFTER ALL IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE LIKE ANNE THE VISION AND THE FACULTY DIVINE THAT GIFT
ANNE RECOVERING HERSELF SPRANG TO OPEN DOORS AND WINDOWS AND LET OUT THE GAS AND SMOKE WHICH FILLED THE ROOM THEN SHE HELPED THE GIRLS CARRY THE UNCONSCIOUS PRILLIE INTO THE PORCH
I SAID SOME DREADFUL THINGS TO MISSUS LYNDE LONG AGO BUT IT WAS WHEN I HAD LOST MY TEMPER I COULDN'T SAY THEM DELIBERATELY IT WAS THE TRUTH AND I BELIEVE IN TELLING THE TRUTH TO EVERYBODY
FINALLY THE MORNING DAWNED PEARLY AND LUSTROUS IN A SKY FULL OF SILVER SHEEN AND RADIANCE AND THE WONDERFUL DAY HAD ARRIVED DIANA APPEARED SOON AFTER BREAKFAST WITH A BASKET OF FLOWERS OVER ONE ARM AND HER MUSLIN DRESS OVER THE OTHER
AND I SAW MARY SENTNER FROM SPENCER VALE IN MISTER BLAIR'S STORE SHE SAYS THE OLD COPP GIRLS ON THE TORY ROAD HAVE A WILLOW WARE PLATTER AND SHE THINKS IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE WE HAD AT THE SUPPER SHE SAYS THEY'LL LIKELY SELL IT
I DIDN'T LIKE MISSUS LYNDE AT FIRST EITHER BUT AS SOON AS I CAME TO UNDERSTAND HER I LEARNED TO MISSUS LYNDE MAY BE AN ACQUIRED TASTE WITH SOME FOLKS
MISS LAVENDAR WAS GETTING READY TO BE MARRIED AND THE STONE HOUSE WAS THE SCENE OF ENDLESS CONSULTATIONS AND PLANNINGS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH HOVERING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THINGS IN AGITATED DELIGHT AND WONDER THEN THE DRESSMAKER CAME
THE LUCKLESS IMPROVERS EXPECTED THAT AVONLEA WOULD BE MORE PREJUDICED THAN EVER AGAINST THEM BUT INSTEAD PUBLIC SYMPATHY VEERED AROUND IN THEIR FAVOR
HER VOICE WAS QUITE LOW BUT IT MADE A SHIVER GO UP AND DOWN PAUL IRVING'S SPINE JOE SLOANE CAUGHT HER EYE FELT RESPONSIBLE FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLE OF HIS FEET BUT STUTTERED OUT WILDLY
BUT THE OLDEST TWIN SAYS IT WAS ONLY A FEW MINUTES YOU SEE IN THE SUNSET LAND THE TIME IS EVER SO MUCH LONGER THAN IT IS HERE YOUR LOVING PUPIL PAUL IRVING
MISSUS MORGAN IS COMING TODAY ANNE WONDERED HOW MISTER HARRISON COULD GO ON PLACIDLY MOWING HAY IN THE FIELD ACROSS THE LANE JUST AS IF NOTHING WERE GOING TO HAPPEN THE PARLOR AT GREEN GABLES WAS A RATHER SEVERE AND GLOOMY APARTMENT
YOU CAN'T HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MISTAKE SINCE HE CLAIMS HE WAS NEVER TOLD WHAT THE COLOR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BUT JUST GIVEN THE CANS AND TOLD TO GO AHEAD BUT IT'S A BURNING SHAME AND THAT HALL CERTAINLY DOES LOOK AWFUL
TAKE YOUR SEAT AND WORK OUT THE SIX PROBLEMS ON PAGE EIGHTY FOUR OF YOUR ARITHMETIC FOR PUNISHMENT SAID ANNE SAINT CLAIR LOOKED RATHER AMAZED AT HER TONE BUT HE WENT MEEKLY TO HIS DESK AND TOOK OUT HIS SLATE THEN HE STEALTHILY PASSED A SMALL PARCEL TO JOE SLOANE ACROSS THE AISLE
NOW WHERE IS THE ROMANCE IN ALL THAT OH THERE ISN'T ANY WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY GASPED ANNE RATHER AS IF SOMEBODY HAD THROWN COLD WATER OVER HER I SUPPOSE THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS IN PROSE
IT IS JUST THAT HE HAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF TACT OR IMAGINATION DEAR MISS SHIRLEY YOU TOLD US TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING STRANGE WE HAVE SEEN I WILL DESCRIBE THE AVONLEA HALL IT HAS TWO DOORS AN INSIDE ONE AND AN OUTSIDE ONE
MY AUNT MARY IS A VERY PARTICULAR WOMAN AND A GREAT HOUSEKEEPER THE FIRST NIGHT I WAS THERE WE WERE AT TEA I KNOCKED OVER A JUG AND BROKE IT AUNT MARY SAID SHE HAD HAD THAT JUG EVER SINCE SHE WAS MARRIED AND NOBODY HAD EVER BROKEN IT BEFORE
IT IS BETTER TO POSSESS IT LIVING IN A GARRET THAN TO BE THE INHABITANT OF PALACES WITHOUT IT THE AVONLEA GRAVEYARD WAS AS YET THE GRASS GROWN SOLITUDE IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN
SAID MARILLA PUSHING HIM TOWARD THE HALL WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR DESSERT ASKED ANNE LOOKING REGRETFULLY AT THE WRECK AND RUIN GET OUT A CROCK OF STRAWBERRY PRESERVES SAID MARILLA CONSOLINGLY
ESPECIALLY AS SHE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHERE THE MOUSE HAD GONE BUT SHE DECIDED NOT TO WHO COULD TAKE ANY COMFORT OUT OF HYSTERICS WITH A TEACHER SO WHITE FACED AND SO BLAZING EYED STANDING BEFORE ONE WHO PUT THAT MOUSE IN MY DESK SAID ANNE
AND LOOKED MORE EXCITED THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO LOOK BEFORE AT HALF PAST TWELVE THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY CAME EVERYTHING WAS GOING WELL BUT ANNE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL NERVOUS IT WAS SURELY TIME FOR PRISCILLA AND MISSUS MORGAN TO ARRIVE
YES I AM SURE SHE WILL PAUL YOU SEE TEACHER IT'S JUST THREE YEARS TODAY SINCE MY LITTLE MOTHER DIED IT'S SUCH A LONG LONG TIME BUT IT HURTS JUST AS MUCH AS EVER AND I MISS HER JUST AS MUCH AS EVER
OF COURSE THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WAS THAT HE MUST BE GOOD BUT HE TRIED TO BE GOOD AND I HADN'T THE HEART TO DISAPPOINT HIM YOU'LL DROWN YOURSELF OR THE TWINS ROWING ABOUT THE POND IN THAT FLAT GRUMBLED MARILLA
ANNE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE WRETCHED JOSEPH SHE LOOKED AT ANTHONY PYE AND ANTHONY PYE LOOKED BACK UNABASHED AND UNASHAMED ANTHONY WAS IT YOU YES IT WAS SAID ANTHONY INSOLENTLY
ANNE TURNED FROM THE SECOND READER CLASS WHICH SHE WAS HEARING REALLY BARBARA SHE SAID ICILY IF YOU CANNOT MOVE WITHOUT FALLING OVER SOMETHING YOU'D BETTER REMAIN IN YOUR SEAT IT IS POSITIVELY DISGRACEFUL FOR A GIRL OF YOUR AGE TO BE SO AWKWARD
I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN FOR YOU IN THE WAY OF TEA BUT I WARN YOU NOT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT BREAD AND BUTTER AND SOME COWCUMBERS MARTHA LOCKED UP ALL THE CAKE AND CHEESE AND PRESERVES AFORE SHE WENT SHE ALWAYS DOES BECAUSE SHE SAYS I'M TOO EXTRAVAGANT WITH THEM IF COMPANY COMES
BECAUSE I'D PROMISED GRANDMOTHER I'D NEVER ASSOCIATE WITH ANYBODY THAT SWORE HE WAS PRETTY WELL SCARED I CAN TELL YOU AND HE SAID IF I WOULD FORGIVE HIM HE WOULD TAKE ME TO THE SUNSET SO THE NEXT EVENING WHEN I WAS SITTING ON THE STRIPED ROCKS
FOR BY THE TIME AUNTY'S ANKLE IS WELL SHE WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO TORONTO SHE HAS TO BE THERE BY A CERTAIN DATE WELL SIGHED ANNE
BUT ANNE AND DIANA BETWEEN THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT AND THE REACTION FROM THEIR EXCITEMENT OF THE FORENOON COULD NEITHER TALK NOR EAT ANNE TRIED HEROICALLY TO BEAR HER PART IN THE CONVERSATION FOR THE SAKE OF HER GUESTS BUT ALL THE SPARKLE HAD BEEN QUENCHED IN HER FOR THE TIME BEING
AND WAS HAPPY WITH ALL THREE EXCEPT AT THE TIMES OF THE FUNERALS BUT I THINK SHE TOOK A RESK MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM OH IT'S ALL SO ROMANTIC BREATHED ANNE TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT
IN THAT CASE AS THE OLD INDIAN SAID EVERYBODY WOULD WANT MY SQUAW IT WAS PLAIN THAT DIANA DID SEE SOMETHING IN FRED WRIGHT HOWEVER ANNE'S EYES MIGHT BE HOLDEN DIANA CAME TO GREEN GABLES THE NEXT EVENING A PENSIVE SHY YOUNG LADY
SAVE AS AN ABODE OF CORRECTION FOR SETTING HENS ALTHOUGH SCRUPULOUSLY WHITEWASHED IT HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT SHAKY AND ANNE FELT RATHER DUBIOUS AS SHE SCRAMBLED UP FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A KEG PLACED ON A BOX I'M AFRAID IT WON'T BEAR MY WEIGHT
I THINK IT ALMOST PAYS FOR THE THUD WELL MAYBE IT DOES ADMITTED MARILLA I'D RATHER WALK CALMLY ALONG AND DO WITHOUT BOTH FLYING AND THUD BUT EVERYBODY HAS HER OWN WAY OF LIVING I USED TO THINK THERE WAS ONLY ONE RIGHT WAY
ARRIVING AT THIS MOMENT WITH A BANDBOX HE HAD BROUGHT FROM TOWN FOR MARILLA HAVEN'T YOU HEARD SAID JANE WRATHFULLY WELL ITS SIMPLY THIS JOSHUA PYE HAS GONE AND PAINTED THE HALL BLUE INSTEAD OF GREEN A DEEP BRILLIANT BLUE
FOR IT WOULD NOT DO TO DON IT UNTIL ALL THE DINNER PREPARATIONS WERE COMPLETED MEANWHILE SHE WORE HER AFTERNOON PINK PRINT AND A LAWN APRON FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY RUFFLED AND FRILLED AND VERY NEAT AND PRETTY AND ROSY SHE WAS
BUT I WAS TIMID AND FRIGHTENED OF FATHER BESIDES I DIDN'T KNOW MEN WERE SO SKURSE WHEN THE GIRLS WERE SAFELY AWAY DIANA DRIVING AND ANNE HOLDING THE COVETED PLATTER CAREFULLY ON HER LAP
ONE HAND WAS HELD BY FRED WHO STOOD WITH HIS FACE BENT TOWARD HER STAMMERING SOMETHING IN LOW EARNEST TONES THERE WERE NO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD EXCEPT THEIR TWO SELVES AT THAT MAGIC MOMENT SO NEITHER OF THEM SAW ANNE WHO AFTER ONE
OR SOME INTERESTING THING OR PERSON THEY HAD SEEN THEY WERE TO WRITE THE LETTERS ON REAL NOTE PAPER SEAL THEM IN AN ENVELOPE AND ADDRESS THEM TO ME ALL WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER PEOPLE LAST FRIDAY MORNING I FOUND A PILE OF LETTERS ON MY DESK AND THAT EVENING I REALIZED AFRESH
I'LL BE ELEVEN YOU'D NEVER THINK IT TO LOOK AT ME WOULD YOU GRANDMA SAYS I'M VERY SMALL FOR MY AGE AND THAT IT'S ALL BECAUSE I DON'T EAT ENOUGH PORRIDGE I DO MY VERY BEST BUT GRANDMA GIVES SUCH GENEROUS PLATEFULS
THE POOR BIRD HAS BEEN MOPING EVER SINCE THOSE CHILDREN MUST BE A SIGHT OF TROUBLE TO YOU FOLKS EVERYTHING THAT'S WORTH HAVING IS SOME TROUBLE SAID ANNE SECRETLY RESOLVING TO FORGIVE DAVY'S NEXT OFFENCE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE SINCE HE HAD AVENGED HER ON GINGER
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH FEAR THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO TALK AND TO DO HER JUSTICE THERE WASN'T ANNE SHROUDED HER MUSLIN GLORIES IN A BIG APRON AND WENT DOWN TO CONCOCT HER SOUP MARILLA HAD DRESSED HERSELF AND THE TWINS
I KNOW I HAVE RED HAIR TOO ALTHOUGH IT'S MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE SO THERE'S NO NEED OF TELLING ME THAT EITHER WELL WELL I'LL TRY AND NOT MENTION IT AGAIN SINCE YOU'RE SO SENSITIVE
I WONDER WHAT THE COPP GIRLS VALUE THIS HOUSE AT I SHALL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGE I'VE DONE BUT I WOULDN'T MIND THAT IF I WERE ONLY SURE THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND MY MOTIVE IN PEEPING IN AT THEIR PANTRY WINDOW MY SOLE COMFORT IS THAT THE PLATTER IS JUST THE KIND I WANT
REALLY HELD AN ASSORTMENT OF FIRECRACKERS AND PINWHEELS FOR WHICH WARREN SLOANE HAD SENT TO TOWN BY SAINT CLAIR DONNELL'S FATHER THE DAY BEFORE INTENDING TO HAVE A BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION THAT EVENING
EXCUSE ME YOU MUSTN'T MIND IT IT'S JUST A HABIT I'VE GOT YOU'D THINK HE WAS CRAZY WOULDN'T YOU AND AS FOR MISSUS LYNDE BEING A BUSYBODY PERHAPS SHE IS BUT DID YOU TELL HER SHE HAD A VERY KIND HEART AND ALWAYS HELPED THE POOR
HE LETS IT SLEEP ON HIS ROCKING CHARE AND MY AUNT SAYS HE THINKS MORE OF IT THAN HE DOES OF HIS CHILDREN THAT IS NOT RIGHT WE OUGHT TO BE KIND TO CATS AND GIVE THEM NEW MILK BUT WE OUGHT NOT BE BETTER TO THEM THAN TO OUR CHILDREN
MY BIRTHDAY IS NEXT WEEK SAID PAUL AS THEY WALKED UP THE LONG RED HILL BASKING IN THE JUNE SUNSHINE AND FATHER WROTE ME THAT HE IS SENDING ME SOMETHING THAT HE THINKS I'LL LIKE BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE COULD SEND
I AM GLAD DIANA IS SO HAPPY AND SATISFIED BUT WHEN MY TURN COMES IF IT EVER DOES I DO HOPE THERE'LL BE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE THRILLING ABOUT IT BUT THEN DIANA THOUGHT SO TOO ONCE
AFTER ALL IT WAS NOT TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THINGS JUST AS GOOD AND FAR BETTER ARE COMING TRUE FOR ME ALL THE TIME AND I SUPPOSE THE EVENTS OF TODAY HAVE A FUNNY SIDE TOO PERHAPS WHEN DIANA AND I ARE OLD AND GRAY WE SHALL BE ABLE TO LAUGH OVER THEM
MISTER ALLAN SAYS IT IS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CALLING A PLACE A GROVE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREES IN IT SAID DIANA FOR NOBODY LIVES ALONG THE ROAD EXCEPT THE COPP GIRLS
MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE CAME UP THE NEXT SATURDAY AND CONFIRMED THIS WELL ANNE I GUESS YOU'VE WON OVER ANTHONY PYE THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS HE BELIEVES YOU ARE SOME GOOD AFTER ALL EVEN IF YOU ARE A GIRL SAYS THAT WHIPPING YOU GAVE HIM WAS JUST AS GOOD AS A MAN'S
EVERYBODY REALIZED THAT EVEN THE EXPLOSION HAD NOT CLEARED THE TEACHER'S MENTAL ATMOSPHERE NOBODY EXCEPT ANTHONY PYE DARED WHISPER A WORD NED CLAY ACCIDENTALLY SQUEAKED HIS PENCIL WHILE WORKING A SUM CAUGHT ANNE'S EYE AND WISHED THE FLOOR WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW HIM UP
YOU ONLY TELL THE DISAGREEABLE PART OF THE TRUTH NOW YOU'VE TOLD ME A DOZEN TIMES THAT MY HAIR WAS RED BUT YOU'VE NEVER ONCE TOLD ME THAT I HAD A NICE NOSE
IF WE HAVE FRIENDS WE SHOULD LOOK ONLY FOR THE BEST IN THEM AND GIVE THEM THE BEST THAT IS IN US DON'T YOU THINK THEN FRIENDSHIP WOULD BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WORLD FRIENDSHIP IS VERY BEAUTIFUL SMILED MISSUS ALLAN BUT SOME DAY
THE NEWS FLEW LIKE WILDFIRE GILBERT BLYTHE PORING OVER A TEXT BOOK AT HOME HEARD IT FROM HIS FATHER'S HIRED BOY AT SUNSET AND RUSHED BREATHLESSLY TO GREEN GABLES JOINED ON THE WAY BY FRED WRIGHT
THEY SPENT A SPLENDID HALF HOUR CLIMBING ON THE ROOF AND DIVING OFF INTO THE STRAW WITH WHOOPS AND YELLS BUT EVEN UNLAWFUL PLEASURES MUST COME TO AN END WHEN THE RUMBLE OF WHEELS OVER THE POND BRIDGE TOLD THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING HOME FROM CHURCH
HE REVELED IN GETTING OUT IN THE MORNING AND SHOVELING OUT THE PATHS TO THE WELL AND HENHOUSE HE GLORIED IN THE CHRISTMAS TIDE DELICACIES WHICH MARILLA AND MISSUS LYNDE VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN PREPARING FOR ANNE
THAT YOU WON'T SAID GILBERT WONDERING UNEASILY IF IT WERE THAT CONFOUNDED JUNIOR'S OPINION IN PARTICULAR OVER WHICH ANNE WAS WORRIED THE REDS WILL THINK JUST AS I THOUGHT THAT YOU BEING LIKE NINE OUT OF TEN OF US NOT OVERBURDENED WITH WORLDLY WEALTH
BUT FINALLY I GOT A PLOT THAT MATCHED HER THEN CAME THE EXCITEMENT OF CHOOSING NAMES FOR ALL MY CHARACTERS YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW FASCINATING THAT IS I'VE LAIN AWAKE FOR HOURS THINKING OVER THOSE NAMES THE HERO'S NAME IS PERCEVAL DALRYMPLE
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND CAN'T YOU SEE HOW AWFUL IT IS I MUST CONFESS I CAN'T WHAT IS WRONG EVERYTHING MOANED ANNE I FEEL AS IF I WERE DISGRACED FOREVER
SHE WAS IN PURSUIT OF FAME NOT FILTHY LUCRE AND HER LITERARY DREAMS WERE AS YET UNTAINTED BY MERCENARY CONSIDERATIONS YOU'LL LET ME READ IT WON'T YOU PLEADED DIANA WHEN IT IS FINISHED I'LL READ IT TO YOU AND MISTER HARRISON AND I SHALL WANT YOU TO CRITICIZE IT SEVERELY
THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THAT REPORT SAID DIANA BLUSHING WELL DON'T PUT IT OFF TOO LONG SAID AUNT ATOSSA SIGNIFICANTLY YOU'LL FADE SOON YOU'RE ALL COMPLEXION AND HAIR AND THE WRIGHTS ARE TERRIBLE FICKLE
WHEN CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME THE GIRLS OF PATTY'S PLACE SCATTERED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES
IT DOESN'T SEEM A DAY SINCE I CAME HOME THAT SPRING EVENING WITH THE MAYFLOWERS WHEN I WAS LITTLE I COULDN'T SEE FROM ONE END OF THE SUMMER TO THE OTHER IT STRETCHED BEFORE ME LIKE AN UNENDING SEASON NOW TIS A HANDBREADTH TIS A TALE
SPEAKING OF STORIES DIANA REMARKED ANNE IN A SIGNIFICANT CONFIDENTIAL TONE
HAVE YOU FORGIVEN ME ANNE YES DEAR
PAUL SHOOK HIS CHESTNUT CURLS SORROWFULLY THE TWIN SAILORS AND THE GOLDEN LADY NEVER CAME AT ALL HE SAID NORA WAS THERE BUT NORA IS NOT THE SAME TEACHER SHE IS CHANGED OH PAUL IT IS YOU WHO ARE CHANGED SAID ANNE
IF WE COULD SAIL TO IT IN THE MOONSHINE BOAT PAUL WROTE OF IN HIS OLD COMPOSITION YOU REMEMBER HOW NICE IT WOULD BE SAID ANNE ROUSING FROM HER REVERIE
YESTERDAY WAS REAL DINKY BUT I LIKE SOMETHING BRIGHTER FOR MYSELF DID YOU NOTICE THOSE TWO RIDICULOUS BOYS DOWNSTAIRS THEY'VE BOTH COME DETERMINED TO SIT EACH OTHER OUT I DON'T CARE A SINGLE BIT ABOUT EITHER OF THEM YOU KNOW HERB SPENCER IS THE ONE I LIKE
BUT I WOULDN'T PESTER EDITORS WITH IT I'D WRITE OF PEOPLE AND PLACES LIKE I KNEW
PEOPLE WHO DON'T GO VISITING CATCH THINGS TOO SOMETIMES THEY EVEN DIE SAID DIANA SOLEMNLY THEN THEY DON'T HAVE THEMSELVES TO BLAME FOR IT RETORTED AUNT ATOSSA TRIUMPHANTLY
HE HAD A CENT IN HIS POCKET FOR THE SUNDAY SCHOOL COLLECTION AND A FIVE CENT PIECE FOR THE CHURCH COLLECTION HE CARRIED HIS BIBLE IN ONE HAND AND HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL QUARTERLY IN THE OTHER HE KNEW HIS LESSON AND HIS GOLDEN TEXT
APART FROM THIS ANNE ENJOYED HER SUMMER PRISCILLA CAME FOR A MERRY VISIT IN JUNE
YOU KNOW IT'S RATHER DREADFUL TO LAUGH IN CHURCH BUT HEAVEN WON'T BE LIKE CHURCH ALL THE TIME SAID ANNE I HOPE IT AIN'T SAID DAVY EMPHATICALLY
ALWAYS CHATTERING AND WHISPERING OF HER BEAUX AND THEIR RIVALRIES AND DESPAIRS IT WAS THIS THAT MADE ANNE'S VISITS HARD FOR HER WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SILLY OR AMUSING WAS GRUESOME NOW IT WAS DEATH PEERING THROUGH A WILFUL MASK OF LIFE
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS SHE SOBBED RUBY WOULD HAVE LIKED YOU TO HAVE IT IT'S THE EMBROIDERED CENTERPIECE SHE WAS WORKING AT IT ISN'T QUITE FINISHED THE NEEDLE IS STICKING IN IT JUST WHERE HER POOR LITTLE FINGERS PUT IT THE LAST TIME SHE LAID IT DOWN THE AFTERNOON BEFORE SHE DIED
FITZOSBORNE SUGGESTED DIANA WHO HAD A STORE OF SUCH NAMES LAID AWAY IN HER MEMORY RELICS OF THE OLD STORY CLUB WHICH SHE AND ANNE AND JANE ANDREWS AND RUBY GILLIS HAD HAD IN THEIR SCHOOLDAYS ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD DOUBTFULLY
OF TOLERANT WONDER ANNE DESPITE HER AFFECTION FOR RUSTY WAS NOT ESPECIALLY FOND OF CATS BUT MISSUS GARDNER'S TONE ANNOYED HER INCONSEQUENTLY SHE REMEMBERED THAT MISSUS JOHN BLYTHE WAS SO FOND OF CATS THAT SHE KEPT AS MANY AS HER HUSBAND WOULD ALLOW
SAID MISTER HARRISON I DON'T BELIEVE IN PUTTING MARRYING OFF TOO LONG LIKE I DID
ALTHOUGH SHE TOLD HIM ABOUT IT IF IT IS A SUCCESS YOU'LL SEE IT WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED GILBERT BUT IF IT IS A FAILURE NOBODY SHALL EVER SEE IT MARILLA KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE VENTURE
NOT NOWADAYS SAID ANNE ABSENTLY AS THE WIND BLEW A SCUD OF SNOW AGAINST THE WINDOW OH DEAR WILL IT EVER STOP STORMING GOD KNOWS SAID DAVY AIRILY PREPARING TO RESUME HIS READING ANNE WAS SHOCKED THIS TIME
SMILED ANNE I DO IT YET LAUGHED DIANA
PAUL AND CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH CAME HOME FOR JULY AND AUGUST ECHO LODGE WAS THE SCENE OF GAIETIES ONCE MORE AND THE ECHOES OVER THE RIVER WERE KEPT BUSY MIMICKING THE LAUGHTER THAT RANG IN THE OLD GARDEN BEHIND THE SPRUCES
WELL IT WASN'T RIGHT FOR HER TO SAY IT SAID ANNE PROMPTLY DECIDING UPON WHICH HORN OF THIS DILEMMA TO EMPALE HERSELF IT ISN'T RIGHT FOR ANYBODY TO TAKE THAT NAME IN VAIN OR SPEAK IT LIGHTLY DAVY DON'T EVER DO IT AGAIN
MISSUS LYNDE LIMPED OUT OF HER KITCHEN AS HE JOINED DORA ARE YOU CLEAN SHE DEMANDED SEVERELY
HOW ANNE HAD ENVIED THOSE BEAUTIFUL BRAIDS IN OLD SCHOOLDAYS LAY ON EITHER SIDE OF HER SHE HAD TAKEN THE PINS OUT THEY MADE HER HEAD ACHE SHE SAID
IT'S COLLEGE AIRS I S'POSE YOU'D BE WISER TO KEEP AWAY FROM RUBY GILLIS THE DOCTORS SAY CONSUMPTION'S CATCHING I ALWAYS KNEW RUBY'D GET SOMETHING GADDING OFF TO BOSTON LAST FALL FOR A VISIT PEOPLE WHO AIN'T CONTENT TO STAY HOME ALWAYS CATCH SOMETHING
AT LEAST THE COTTONS CERTAINLY HAD AND DAVY SEEMED TO HAVE IT NOT BEING ENTIRELY BEREFT OF PRUDENCE
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT OUT OF YOUR REDMOND COURSE ANNE MURMURED PRISCILLA ASIDE I THINK SAID ANNE SLOWLY THAT I REALLY HAVE LEARNED TO LOOK UPON EACH LITTLE HINDRANCE AS A JEST AND EACH GREAT ONE AS THE FORESHADOWING OF VICTORY
NO SAID ANNE I THINK IT'S TRUE SAID PHIL LIGHTLY ANNE DID NOT SPEAK IN THE DARKNESS SHE FELT HER FACE BURNING SHE SLIPPED HER HAND INSIDE HER COLLAR AND CAUGHT AT THE GOLD CHAIN
AT GREEN GABLES MARILLA WENT PROMPTLY TO MISSUS LYNDE'S DOMAIN WHEN GILBERT CAME AND INSISTED ON TAKING THE TWINS WITH HER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WAS UNMISTAKABLE AND ANNE WAS IN A HELPLESS FURY OVER IT DAVY HOWEVER WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY
RUBY IS THE FIRST OF OUR SCHOOLMATES TO GO ONE BY ONE SOONER OR LATER ALL THE REST OF US MUST FOLLOW YES I SUPPOSE SO SAID DIANA UNCOMFORTABLY
I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S ANYTHING LOW OR UNWORTHY ABOUT THAT OR ANYTHING RIDICULOUS EITHER
THANKING YOU FOR THE INTEREST YOU HAVE SHOWN IN OUR ENTERPRISE WE REMAIN YOURS VERY TRULY
CAST HERSELF ON HER BED AND WEPT TEARS OF SHAME AND OUTRAGED SENSIBILITY OH SHE COULD NEVER LIVE THIS DOWN NEVER GILBERT ARRIVED AT DUSK BRIMMING OVER WITH CONGRATULATIONS
NEVER WERE THERE TWO MORE THOROUGHLY KINDRED SPIRITS CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH HAD BLOSSOMED OUT INTO YOUNG LADYHOOD SHE WORE HER HAIR NOW IN AN ENORMOUS POMPADOR AND HAD DISCARDED THE BLUE RIBBON BOWS OF AULD LANG SYNE
I'M AWFUL GLAD YOU'RE HOME I COULDN'T GO TO SLEEP TILL I'D TOLD SOMEBODY TOLD SOMEBODY WHAT HOW MIS'RUBUL I AM WHY ARE YOU MISERABLE DEAR
BUT HER EYES WANDERED TO ANOTHER BOX ON HER TABLE IT WAS FILLED WITH LILIES OF THE VALLEY AS FRESH AND FRAGRANT AS THOSE WHICH BLOOMED IN THE GREEN GABLES YARD WHEN JUNE CAME TO AVONLEA
AVONLEA HAD NOT CHANGED EITHER AT LEAST SO IT SEEMED AT FIRST BUT AS ANNE SAT IN THE GREEN GABLES PEW
SHE HAD ACHIEVED HER PATHETIC SCENE WITHOUT SACRIFICING ROBERT RAY AND SHE KEPT A WATCHFUL EYE ON DIANA AS SHE READ IT DIANA ROSE TO THE OCCASION AND CRIED PROPERLY BUT WHEN THE END CAME SHE LOOKED A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE PAUL CANNOT FIND THE ROCK PEOPLE LIFE WAS VERY PLEASANT IN AVONLEA THAT SUMMER ALTHOUGH ANNE AMID ALL HER VACATION JOYS WAS HAUNTED BY A SENSE OF SOMETHING GONE WHICH SHOULD BE THERE
WHO NEVER SPOILED A COMPLIMENT BY MISPLACED ECONOMY BUT I MISTRUST YOU HAVEN'T ANY TOO MUCH SENSE YET IT'S NOT TO BE EXPECTED OF COURSE EXPERIENCE TEACHES SENSE YOU CAN'T LEARN IT IN A COLLEGE COURSE
COULD QUITE SUBDUE THE SPARKLE OF HER STARRY HOPES NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS NOT SO RAPT FROM THINGS OF EARTH AS TO BE UNABLE TO NOTICE THAT CHRISTINE'S WALK WAS DECIDEDLY UNGRACEFUL BUT I SUPPOSE GILBERT LOOKS ONLY AT HER FACE
INDEED NO I SAW THE PRIZE OFFER BUT I'D NEVER DREAM OF COMPETING FOR IT
AND HIS CATECHISM QUESTION PERFECTLY HAD HE NOT STUDIED THEM PERFORCE IN MISSUS LYNDE'S KITCHEN ALL LAST SUNDAY AFTERNOON DAVY THEREFORE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN A PLACID FRAME OF MIND AS A MATTER OF FACT
AND THAT WAS WHY IT TURNED OUT SO WELL AND THEN IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH WHERE PERCEVAL CLASPS AVERIL IN HIS ARMS AND SAYS SWEETHEART THE BEAUTIFUL COMING YEARS WILL BRING US THE FULFILMENT OF OUR HOME OF DREAMS I ADDED
HAVE YOU NAMED ALL THE CHARACTERS ASKED DIANA WISTFULLY
OR DOROTHY'S ARDENT IMPULSIVE GOOD WISHES IT WAS OF ONE STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE PANG THAT SPOILED THIS LONG EXPECTED DAY FOR HER AND LEFT IN IT A CERTAIN FAINT BUT ENDURING FLAVOR OF BITTERNESS
THOUGH HE WOULD HAVE DIED BEFORE HE ADMITTED IT TO DORA NOW THAT THE EXHILARATION OF TRUANT DELIGHTS HAD DIED AWAY HIS CONSCIENCE WAS BEGINNING TO GIVE HIM SALUTARY TWINGES
YOU BET SAID DAVY EMPHATICALLY THAT WAS YOUR CONSCIENCE PUNISHING YOU DAVY
IT WAS AN OLD SKETCH I FOUND IN MY BOX I RE WROTE IT AND SENT IT IN BUT I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT IT COULD BE ACCEPTED BECAUSE IT HAD NO PLOT SAID ANNE RECALLING THE BITTER EXPERIENCE OF AVERIL'S ATONEMENT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THAT TEN DOLLARS ANNE
GOD WILL PUNISH YOU IF YOU DO SAID DORA SOLEMNLY THEN I
NOTHING SEEMS QUITE SO DREADFUL NOW GOOD NIGHT ANNE GOOD NIGHT DEAR
WE'VE NEVER SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER SINCE
AND YOU'LL COME UP AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN WON'T YOU ANNE
ANNE'S EYES SHONE ALL THAT DAY LITERARY AMBITIONS SPROUTED AND BUDDED IN HER BRAIN THEIR EXHILARATION ACCOMPANIED HER TO JENNIE COOPER'S WALKING PARTY AND NOT EVEN THE SIGHT OF GILBERT AND CHRISTINE WALKING JUST AHEAD OF HER AND ROY
CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE WAY OF TRANSGRESSORS DAVY AND DORA WERE READY FOR SUNDAY SCHOOL THEY WERE GOING ALONE WHICH DID NOT OFTEN HAPPEN FOR MISSUS LYNDE ALWAYS ATTENDED SUNDAY SCHOOL
CHAPTER TWELVE AVERIL'S ATONEMENT WHAT ARE YOU DREAMING OF ANNE THE TWO GIRLS WERE LOITERING ONE EVENING IN A FAIRY HOLLOW OF THE BROOK FERNS NODDED IN IT
AUTHORS ARE KITTLE CATTLE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN OR HOW THEY WILL BREAK OUT ANNE MAY MAKE COPY OF US I MEANT THAT THE ABILITY TO WRITE FOR THE PRESS WAS A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY SAID AUNT JAMESINA SEVERELY AND I HOPE ANNE REALIZES IT
ANYTHING LIKE THAT SEEMS SILLY NOW BUT EM AND I MADE UP THE OLD QUARREL YESTERDAY
HE COULD HARDLY WAIT TO EAT HIS SUPPER COULD HE NOT SEE NORA'S ELFIN FACE PEERING AROUND THE POINT WATCHING FOR HIM WISTFULLY BUT IT WAS A VERY SOBER PAUL WHO CAME BACK FROM THE SHORE IN THE TWILIGHT DIDN'T YOU FIND YOUR ROCK PEOPLE ASKED ANNE
THEY DARED NOT OF COURSE GO FISHING ON THE POND WHERE THEY WOULD BE SEEN BY PEOPLE GOING TO CHURCH THEY HAD TO RESORT TO THE BROOK IN THE WOODS BEHIND THE COTTON HOUSE BUT IT WAS FULL OF TROUT AND THEY HAD A GLORIOUS TIME THAT MORNING
WHICH WERE NOT WHOLLY FULFILLED SHE FOUND AVONLEA IN THE GRIP OF SUCH AN EARLY COLD AND STORMY WINTER AS EVEN THE OLDEST INHABITANT COULD NOT RECALL GREEN GABLES WAS LITERALLY HEMMED IN BY HUGE DRIFTS ALMOST EVERY DAY OF THAT ILL STARRED VACATION IT STORMED FIERCELY
AND YOU'LL NEVER BE BAD LIKE THAT AGAIN
ONE ENERGETIC TWIST AND IT GAVE WAY ANNE THRUST THE BROKEN TRINKET INTO HER POCKET HER HANDS WERE TREMBLING AND HER EYES WERE SMARTING BUT SHE WAS THE GAYEST OF ALL THE GAY REVELLERS THAT NIGHT AND TOLD GILBERT UNREGRETFULLY
I SEE SOMETHING'S GONE WRONG ANNE I'M GOING TO BE IMPERTINENT AND ASK WHAT HAVE YOU QUARRELLED NO IT'S ONLY THAT GILBERT WANTS MORE THAN FRIENDSHIP AND I CAN'T GIVE HIM MORE ARE YOU SURE OF THAT ANNE PERFECTLY SURE
DEATH JUST CAME AND STARED ME IN THE FACE UNTIL I GOT SO FRIGHTENED
AND WADED UP TO GREEN GABLES EVERY POSSIBLE EVENING BUT GILBERT'S VISITS WERE NOT WHAT THEY ONCE WERE ANNE ALMOST DREADED THEM IT WAS VERY DISCONCERTING TO LOOK UP IN THE MIDST OF A SUDDEN SILENCE AND FIND GILBERT'S HAZEL EYES FIXED UPON HER
I'M AFRAID THAT IS TOO ARISTOCRATIC A NAME FOR A CHORE BOY DIANA
THERE ARE HEAPS OF THINGS YOU NEVER LEARN AT SCHOOL QUOTED STELLA HAVE YOU LEARNED ANYTHING AT REDMOND EXCEPT DEAD LANGUAGES AND GEOMETRY AND SUCH TRASH QUERIED AUNT JAMESINA OH YES I THINK WE HAVE AUNTY PROTESTED ANNE
IF YOU ARE GOING TO EMBARK IN LITERATURE THOUGH TO BE SURE ADDED
AND SHE SAT DOWN BY THE WINDOW IN THE FAST FALLING WINTRY TWILIGHT THE SUN HAD SET AND THE WIND HAD DIED DOWN A PALE CHILLY MOON LOOKED OUT BEHIND A BANK OF PURPLE CLOUDS IN THE WEST THE SKY FADED OUT BUT THE STRIP OF YELLOW ALONG THE WESTERN HORIZON GREW BRIGHTER AND FIERCER
CRIED DAVY BUT IN THE VOICE OF ONE WHO DOTH PROTEST TOO MUCH NO WONDER YOU HADN'T JUST SITTING THERE LIKE A LIKE A MULE I AIN'T GOING TO SOCIATE WITH THE COTTONS
OF COURSE IT WILL BE ACCEPTED AND THEY WILL LIKELY ASK YOU TO SEND THEM MORE YOU MAY BE AS FAMOUS AS MISSUS MORGAN SOME DAY ANNE AND THEN HOW PROUD I'LL BE OF KNOWING YOU SAID DIANA WHO POSSESSED AT LEAST THE STRIKING MERIT
WON'T THEY SOON BE TOO OLD TO GET MARRIED ANNE I HOPE GILBERT WON'T COURT YOU THAT LONG WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE MARRIED ANNE MISSUS LYNDE SAYS IT'S A SURE THING MISSUS LYNDE IS A BEGAN ANNE HOTLY THEN STOPPED
THE WEATHER HAS BEEN REAL COLD SHE WROTE SO I LET THE CATS SLEEP IN THE HOUSE RUSTY AND JOSEPH ON THE SOFA IN THE LIVING ROOM AND THE SARAH CAT ON THE FOOT OF MY BED IT'S REAL COMPANY TO HEAR HER PURRING WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE NIGHT AND THINK OF MY POOR DAUGHTER IN THE FOREIGN FIELD
AND ALL THAT RUBY SAID WAS SO HORRIBLY TRUE SHE WAS LEAVING EVERYTHING SHE CARED FOR SHE HAD LAID UP HER TREASURES ON EARTH ONLY SHE HAD LIVED SOLELY FOR THE LITTLE THINGS OF LIFE THE THINGS THAT PASS FORGETTING THE GREAT THINGS THAT GO ONWARD INTO ETERNITY
I COULDN'T GO TO ANY OF THE PLACES I'VE BEEN INVITED AND TAKE THOSE THREE CATS SHE SAID AND I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE POOR CREATURES HERE ALONE FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS
BUT THERE'S NOTHING EXCEPT MILLIONAIRES ON THIS STREET SO I'LL STAY HERE AND KEEP PATTY'S PLACE WARM FOR YOU
HE BELONGS TO ME AND I WANT HIM TO LIVE AND FLOURISH
BUT WOULD DO HER HAIR LOW FRIDAY AFTERNOON NONE OF THE GIRLS HAD CLASSES AT REDMOND STELLA TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE A PAPER FOR THE PHILOMATHIC SOCIETY AND WAS SITTING AT THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF THE LIVING ROOM
BUT HER FACE WAS AS FRECKLED HER NOSE AS SNUBBED AND HER MOUTH AND SMILES AS WIDE AS EVER YOU DON'T THINK I TALK WITH A YANKEE ACCENT DO YOU MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM SHE DEMANDED ANXIOUSLY I DON'T NOTICE IT CHARLOTTA I'M REAL GLAD OF THAT
WAS HONESTLY ALARMED LEST HE SHOULD NEVER IN THE WORLD BE ABLE TO GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT AGAIN DARN HER EXPLODED DAVY OH DAVY DON'T SWEAR GASPED DORA IN DISMAY
WHY DID YOU KILL MAURICE LENNOX SHE ASKED REPROACHFULLY HE WAS THE VILLAIN PROTESTED ANNE HE HAD TO BE PUNISHED I LIKE HIM BEST OF THEM ALL SAID UNREASONABLE DIANA
BUT AT LEAST SHE WORE DRESSES WE'VE COME
RUSTY AND JOSEPH LEFT TO THEMSELVES BEGAN A GAME OF CHASE AND SPRANG MADLY INTO MISSUS GARDNER'S SILKEN LAP AND OUT OF IT IN THEIR WILD CAREER MISSUS GARDNER LIFTED HER LORGNETTE
PROTESTED DORA YOU'VE GOT TO SAID DAVY IF YOU DON'T COME I'LL TELL MARILLA THAT FRANK BELL KISSED YOU IN SCHOOL LAST MONDAY
BUT ONE DID NOT HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH DORA OF COURSE NOT HE ADMITTED SULKILY TOMCAT ISN'T A HOLY WORD I WOULDN'T MENTION SUCH AN ANIMAL BEFORE A MINISTER AT ALL BUT IF YOU HAD TO PERSISTED DORA
THE ROUND OF LIFE ANNE WAS BACK IN AVONLEA WITH THE LUSTER OF THE THORBURN SCHOLARSHIP ON HER BROW
ALWAYS IN A PAINFULLY DISTINCT VOICE AND ALWAYS IN THE PRESENCE OF A CROWD IF SHE HAD HEARD FROM GILBERT LATELY POOR ANNE COULD ONLY BLUSH HORRIBLY AND MURMUR NOT VERY LATELY WHICH WAS TAKEN BY ALL MISSUS BLYTHE INCLUDED TO BE MERELY A MAIDENLY EVASION
ANNE TOOK THIS SECOND REJECTION WITH THE CALMNESS OF DESPAIR SHE LOCKED THE STORY AWAY IN THE GARRET TRUNK WHERE THE OLD STORY CLUB TALES REPOSED
SOMETHING FOR WHICH ACCUSTOMED THOUGHT AND IDEAL AND ASPIRATION HAD UNFITTED HER THE LITTLE THINGS OF LIFE SWEET AND EXCELLENT IN THEIR PLACE MUST NOT BE THE THINGS LIVED FOR THE HIGHEST MUST BE SOUGHT AND FOLLOWED THE LIFE OF HEAVEN MUST BE BEGUN HERE ON EARTH
AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE OUT IN THE DAMP YOU'LL COME UP SOON AGAIN YES VERY SOON AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP YOU I'LL BE SO GLAD I KNOW YOU HAVE HELPED ME ALREADY
I SPENT IT USEFULLY FOR CLOTHES AND HATED THEM EVERY TIME I PUT THEM ON THINK OF HAVING A REAL LIVE AUTHOR AT PATTY'S PLACE SAID PRISCILLA
LEAVING HER PALE AND CHILDLIKE THE MOON ROSE IN THE SILVERY SKY EMPEARLING THE CLOUDS AROUND HER BELOW THE POND SHIMMERED IN ITS HAZY RADIANCE JUST BEYOND THE GILLIS HOMESTEAD WAS THE CHURCH WITH THE OLD GRAVEYARD BESIDE IT
BUT HER TONGUE IS SHARPER STILL LATE AS IT WAS AUNT ATOSSA WAS CUTTING POTATO SETS IN THE WRIGHT KITCHEN SHE WORE A FADED OLD WRAPPER AND HER GRAY HAIR WAS DECIDEDLY UNTIDY AUNT ATOSSA DID NOT LIKE BEING CAUGHT IN A KILTER

BUT ANNE WOULD NOT TALK OF THESE THINGS SHE SEEMED WRAPPED IN A REVERIE IN WHICH DIANA FELT LONESOMELY THAT SHE HAD NEITHER LOT NOR PART RUBY GILLIS WAS A GREAT GIRL TO LAUGH SAID DAVY SUDDENLY
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX THE GARDNERS'CALL HERE IS A LETTER WITH AN INDIAN STAMP FOR YOU AUNT JIMSIE SAID PHIL HERE ARE THREE FOR STELLA AND TWO FOR PRIS AND A GLORIOUS FAT ONE FOR ME FROM JO

SHE WAS ALWAYS KIND TO YOU SHE HAS BEEN KIND TO THE LAST MARILLA THIS LETTER IS FROM HER LAWYER SHE HAS LEFT ME A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN HER WILL GRACIOUS AIN'T THAT AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY EXCLAIMED DAVY
SHE SAT PRIMLY ON A HENCOOP IN THE YARD WHILE THE OTHERS PLAYED AN UPROARIOUS GAME OF TAG AND THEN THEY ALL CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE PIG HOUSE ROOF AND CUT THEIR INITIALS ON THE SADDLEBOARD
DAVY IS THAT YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER A WHITE CLAD FIGURE FLUNG ITSELF ACROSS THE FLOOR
HER FATHER THOUGHT IT BETTER THAT SHE SHOULDN'T TEACH TILL NEW YEAR'S AND THE FANCY WORK SHE LOVED OFTENER AND OFTENER FELL FROM HANDS GROWN TOO WEARY FOR IT BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS GAY ALWAYS HOPEFUL
THE MOONLIGHT SHONE ON THE WHITE STONES BRINGING THEM OUT IN CLEAR CUT RELIEF AGAINST THE DARK TREES BEHIND HOW STRANGE THE GRAVEYARD LOOKS BY MOONLIGHT SAID RUBY SUDDENLY HOW GHOSTLY SHE SHUDDERED ANNE
NO IT'S IN YOUR SOUL ANSWERED ANNE THANKFUL FOR THE DARKNESS SINCE GRAVITY MUST BE PRESERVED IN SERIOUS MATTERS I S'POSE I CAN'T GET CLEAR OF IT THEN SAID DAVY WITH A SIGH
HE GLIBLY RECITED AN OLD GOLDEN TEXT LEARNED SEVERAL WEEKS AGO FORTUNATELY MISSUS LYNDE NOW STOPPED QUESTIONING HIM BUT DAVY DID NOT ENJOY HIS DINNER
IN GRIM DELIBERATE SILENCE WHILE DORA WATCHED HIM WITH THE FASCINATION OF HORROR DAVY STEPPED OFF THE GREEN GRASS OF THE ROADSIDE ANKLE DEEP INTO THE FINE DUST WHICH FOUR WEEKS OF RAINLESS WEATHER HAD MADE ON THE ROAD
WHY I HEARD PRISCILLA SAY ONCE THAT THE CANADIAN WOMAN ONLY PAYS FIVE DOLLARS FOR A STORY ANNE HELD OUT THE HATEFUL PINK SLIP IN SHAKING FINGERS I CAN'T TAKE IT IT'S YOURS BY RIGHT DIANA YOU SENT THE STORY IN AND MADE THE ALTERATIONS I
COULDN'T YOU HAVE CHANGED HER NAME NO THE THING WAS IMPOSSIBLE I TRIED TO BUT I COULDN'T DO IT ANY MORE THAN I COULD CHANGE YOURS
SHE HAD SO SPENT MANY EVENINGS THAT SUMMER ALTHOUGH SHE OFTEN WONDERED WHAT GOOD IT DID ANY ONE AND SOMETIMES WENT HOME DECIDING THAT SHE COULD NOT GO AGAIN RUBY GREW PALER AS THE SUMMER WANED THE WHITE SANDS SCHOOL WAS GIVEN UP
YOU MUST PAY THE PENALTY OF GROWING UP PAUL YOU MUST LEAVE FAIRYLAND BEHIND YOU YOU TWO TALK AS MUCH FOOLISHNESS AS EVER YOU DID SAID OLD MISSUS IRVING HALF INDULGENTLY HALF REPROVINGLY OH NO WE DON'T SAID ANNE
YES'M QUAKINGLY WAS PRAYER MEETING I I DON'T KNOW YOU SHOULD KNOW YOU SHOULD LISTEN MORE ATTENTIVELY TO THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WHAT WAS MISTER HARVEY'S TEXT DAVY TOOK A FRANTIC GULP OF WATER
SHE HAD NEVER MET ANY OF ROY'S FAMILY SHE REALIZED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIS STATEMENT AND IT HAD SOMEHOW AN IRREVOCABLENESS ABOUT IT THAT CHILLED HER I SHALL BE GLAD TO SEE THEM SHE SAID FLATLY AND THEN WONDERED IF SHE REALLY WOULD BE GLAD SHE OUGHT TO BE OF COURSE
I'M THE ONLY ONE OF THE FAMILY HE TELLS THINGS TO POOR BOY NOBODY COULD CONFIDE IN MAMMA AND ALINE YOU KNOW WHAT GLORIOUS TIMES YOU GIRLS MUST HAVE HERE WON'T YOU LET ME COME OFTEN AND HAVE A SHARE IN THEM COME AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE ANNE RESPONDED HEARTILY
IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD AS JUDSON PARKER'S PATENT MEDICINE FENCE SO SPAKE ANNE LOFTILY LITTLE DREAMING OF THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION AWAITING HER THAT VERY EVENING DIANA POPPED INTO THE PORCH GABLE BRIGHT EYED AND ROSY CHEEKED CARRYING A LETTER
AS IF ALL THE STRAY GLEAMS OF LIGHT WERE CONCENTRATING IN ONE SPOT THE DISTANT HILLS RIMMED WITH PRIEST LIKE FIRS STOOD OUT IN DARK DISTINCTNESS AGAINST IT ANNE LOOKED ACROSS THE STILL WHITE FIELDS COLD AND LIFELESS IN THE HARSH LIGHT OF THAT GRIM SUNSET
DIANA PRUDENTLY REFRAINED FROM ANY FURTHER CRITICISM BUT MISTER HARRISON WAS MUCH HARDER TO PLEASE FIRST HE TOLD HER THERE WAS ENTIRELY TOO MUCH DESCRIPTION IN THE STORY CUT OUT ALL THOSE FLOWERY PASSAGES HE SAID UNFEELINGLY
I RUN AWAY FROM SUNDAY SCHOOL AND WENT FISHING WITH THE COTTONS
LET'S ALL GO UP TOWN AND GET DRUNK SUGGESTED PHIL I AM GOING TO SQUANDER IT IN A WILD SOULLESS REVEL OF SOME SORT DECLARED ANNE GAILY AT ALL EVENTS IT ISN'T TAINTED MONEY LIKE THE CHECK I GOT FOR THAT HORRIBLE RELIABLE BAKING POWDER STORY
ANNE PRESSED HER HAND IN AN AGONY OF SYMPATHY
THERE IS TOO WOULD YOU DEMANDED DORA GRAVELY WOULD YOU SAY TOMCAT BEFORE THE MINISTER THIS WAS A STAGGERER DAVY WAS NOT PREPARED FOR SUCH A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH
AND I'D RATHER HAVE YOU THAN ANY ONE ELSE I ALWAYS LIKED YOU BEST OF ALL THE GIRLS I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH YOU WERE NEVER JEALOUS OR MEAN LIKE SOME OF THEM
AWFUL OLD GOSSIP COMPLETED DAVY CALMLY THAT'S WHAT EVERY ONE CALLS HER BUT IS IT A SURE THING ANNE I WANT TO KNOW YOU'RE A VERY SILLY LITTLE BOY DAVY SAID ANNE STALKING HAUGHTILY OUT OF THE ROOM THE KITCHEN WAS DESERTED
WHILE DIANA AND FRED AND MANY OTHER GAY COUPLES LOITERED ALONG THE DUSKY STARLIT COUNTRY ROADS THERE WAS A QUEER LONELY ACHE IN HER HEART WHICH SHE COULD NOT EXPLAIN AWAY GILBERT DID NOT EVEN WRITE TO HER AS SHE THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE DONE
SHE WOULD NOT ADMIT EVEN IN HER INMOST REFLECTIONS THAT THIS WAS CAUSED BY GILBERT'S ABSENCE BUT WHEN SHE HAD TO WALK HOME ALONE FROM PRAYER MEETINGS AND A V I S POW WOWS
ANNE PUZZLED OPENED THE LETTER AND GLANCED OVER THE TYPEWRITTEN CONTENTS MISS ANNE SHIRLEY GREEN GABLES AVONLEA P E ISLAND DEAR MADAM
OH ISN'T SHE DREADFUL GASPED DIANA AS THEY ESCAPED DOWN THE LANE SHE'S WORSE THAN MISS ELIZA ANDREWS SAID ANNE
THAT ONE SIN DEMANDS ANOTHER TO COVER IT THEY HAD DINNER WITH MISSUS LYNDE THAT DAY AND THE FIRST THING SHE ASKED DAVY WAS WERE ALL YOUR CLASS IN SUNDAY SCHOOL TODAY YES'M
ANNE WALKED IN SILENCE PHIL CHATTERED OF MANY THINGS SUDDENLY SHE SAID
LIFE HELD A DIFFERENT MEANING A DEEPER PURPOSE ON THE SURFACE IT WOULD GO ON JUST THE SAME BUT THE DEEPS HAD BEEN STIRRED IT MUST NOT BE WITH HER AS WITH POOR BUTTERFLY RUBY
BUT SHE PROMISED TO GO AND DIANA OFFERED TO GO WITH HER
THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU ANNE EXCEPT A CIRCULAR NOBODY NOTICED ANNE'S FLUSH AS SHE TOOK THE THIN LETTER PHIL TOSSED HER CARELESSLY BUT A FEW MINUTES LATER PHIL LOOKED UP TO SEE A TRANSFIGURED ANNE HONEY WHAT GOOD THING HAS HAPPENED
SO YOU MUST TAKE THE CHECK I'D LIKE TO SEE MYSELF SAID DIANA SCORNFULLY WHY WHAT I DID WASN'T ANY TROUBLE THE HONOR OF BEING A FRIEND OF THE PRIZEWINNER IS ENOUGH FOR ME WELL I MUST GO
BUT HE KNEW ANYWAY DAVY THAT'S WHAT DORA SAID
OH I THINK SOME PARTS OF IT ARE FINE CONCEDED DAVY THAT STORY ABOUT JOSEPH NOW IT'S BULLY BUT IF I'D BEEN JOSEPH
MAKE A JEST OF YOUR DIFFICULTIES BUT OVERCOME THEM ISN'T THAT WORTH LEARNING AUNT JIMSIE YES IT IS DEARIE WHEN YOU'VE LEARNED TO LAUGH AT THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE LAUGHED AT AND NOT TO LAUGH AT THOSE THAT SHOULDN'T YOU'VE GOT WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING
IT SEEMS JUST YESTERDAY THAT PRIS AND I WERE ALONE IN THAT CROWD OF FRESHMEN AT REDMOND AND NOW WE ARE SENIORS IN OUR FINAL EXAMINATIONS POTENT WISE AND REVEREND SENIORS QUOTED PHIL DO YOU SUPPOSE WE REALLY ARE ANY WISER THAN WHEN WE CAME TO REDMOND
AND HAILED DAVY'S APPEARANCE WITH WHOOPS OF DELIGHT PETE TOMMY ADOLPHUS AND MIRABEL COTTON WERE ALL ALONE THEIR MOTHER AND OLDER SISTERS WERE AWAY DORA WAS THANKFUL MIRABEL WAS THERE AT LEAST
EXPLAINED DIANA OH ANYTHING DOES FOR AN EXCUSE OF COURSE SAID AUNT ATOSSA AMIABLY
COLLEGE CIRCLES EXPECTED THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HER ENGAGEMENT TO ROY ANY DAY ANNE EXPECTED IT HERSELF YET JUST BEFORE SHE LEFT PATTY'S PLACE FOR CONVOCATION SHE FLUNG ROY'S VIOLETS ASIDE AND PUT GILBERT'S LILIES OF THE VALLEY IN THEIR PLACE
DAVY KNEW THEY MUST GO HE DISCARDED TOMMY'S OVERALLS RESUMED HIS OWN RIGHTFUL ATTIRE AND TURNED AWAY FROM HIS STRING OF TROUT WITH A SIGH NO USE TO THINK OF TAKING THEM HOME WELL HADN'T WE A SPLENDID TIME
AND THE BARRYS HAVE BEEN EXPECTING TO HEAR OF HER DEATH ANY TIME IT IS WELL SHE IS AT REST
WE ARE GETTING VERY VERY WISE AND IT IS SUCH A PITY
AND THE MINISTER WHO HADN'T HEARD A WORD SHE SAID IMMEDIATELY REMARKED IN A VERY DEVOUT VOICE
YOU HAVE GROWN TOO OLD FOR THE ROCK PEOPLE THEY LIKE ONLY CHILDREN FOR PLAYFELLOWS I AM AFRAID THE TWIN SAILORS WILL NEVER AGAIN COME TO YOU IN THE PEARLY ENCHANTED BOAT WITH THE SAIL OF MOONSHINE AND THE GOLDEN LADY WILL PLAY NO MORE FOR YOU ON HER GOLDEN HARP EVEN NORA WILL NOT MEET YOU MUCH LONGER
THEN POOR DAVY BETOOK HIMSELF TO A SECLUDED RETREAT BEHIND THE WOODPILE TO THINK OVER THE WAY OF TRANSGRESSORS GREEN GABLES WAS WRAPPED IN DARKNESS AND SILENCE WHEN ANNE REACHED HOME SHE LOST NO TIME GOING TO BED FOR SHE WAS VERY TIRED AND SLEEPY
BUT MEANWHILE BOARD AND TUITION FEES HAVE TO BE PAID
DAVY WOULD LIKELY TAKE TO HIS HEELS AND SHE COULD NOT PURSUE HIM TODAY WELL BE SURE YOU BEHAVE YOURSELVES SHE WARNED THEM DON'T WALK IN THE DUST DON'T STOP IN THE PORCH TO TALK TO THE OTHER CHILDREN DON'T SQUIRM OR WRIGGLE IN YOUR PLACES
BUT I CALL HER MOTHER LAVENDAR AND I LOVE HER NEXT BEST TO FATHER I I EVEN LOVE HER A LITTLE BETTER THAN YOU TEACHER
SHE'S THE WOMAN YOU AND DIANA LIT ON WHEN YOU JUMPED INTO THE SPARE ROOM BED AIN'T SHE DIANA TOLD ME THAT STORY IS THAT WHY SHE LEFT YOU SO MUCH
THIS CAKE IS NOW WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A FLAT FAILURE AND THE CUSHION IS LIKEWISE RUINED NEVER TELL ME THAT FRIDAY ISN'T UNLUCKY PEOPLE WHO SEND WORD THEY ARE COMING ON SATURDAY SHOULDN'T COME ON FRIDAY SAID AUNT JAMESINA
THAT OF THE BREATHLESS MOMENT WHEN THE STATELY PRESIDENT OF REDMOND GAVE HER CAP AND DIPLOMA AND HAILED HER B A IT WAS NOT OF THE FLASH IN GILBERT'S EYES WHEN HE SAW HER LILIES NOR THE PUZZLED PAINED GLANCE ROY GAVE HER AS HE PASSED HER ON THE PLATFORM
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THERE WASN'T A WORD IN MY STORY ABOUT ABOUT ANNE CHOKED A LITTLE OVER THE WORD BAKING POWDER OH I PUT THAT IN SAID DIANA REASSURED
HOW THANKFUL LITTLE PHIL WILL BE WHEN ALL THIS EXAMINATING IS OVER EXAMINATING I NEVER HEARD SUCH A WORD WELL HAVEN'T I AS GOOD A RIGHT TO MAKE A WORD AS ANY ONE ELSE DEMANDED PHIL WORDS AREN'T MADE THEY GROW
ADDED DAVY CAUTIOUSLY I MIGHT BE BAD SOME OTHER WAY YOU WON'T SAY NAUGHTY WORDS OR RUN AWAY ON SUNDAYS OR TELL FALSEHOODS TO COVER UP YOUR SINS NO IT DOESN'T PAY SAID DAVY WELL DAVY JUST TELL GOD YOU ARE SORRY AND ASK HIM TO FORGIVE YOU
SHE EXPECTED THAT DAVY WOULD BE STRUCK DOWN DEAD ON THE SPOT BUT NOTHING HAPPENED ANYWAY
I WAS SURE OF IT I SENT YOUR STORY INTO THE COMPETITION ANNE
ANNE SCRAMBLED TO HER FEET SOMEHOW EMPTYING TWO INDIGNANT CATS OUT OF HER LAP AS SHE DID SO AND MECHANICALLY SHIFTING HER WISHBONE FROM HER RIGHT HAND TO HER LEFT PRISCILLA WHO WOULD HAVE HAD TO CROSS THE ROOM TO REACH THE KITCHEN DOOR LOST HER HEAD
THEY SAID I DID AT HOME BUT I THOUGHT LIKELY THEY JUST WANTED TO AGGRAVATE ME I DON'T WANT NO YANKEE ACCENT
THIS IS THE END OF MY LITERARY AMBITIONS SHE SAID BITTERLY SHE NEVER MENTIONED THE MATTER TO MISTER HARRISON
DAVY ANSWERED WITH A DEFIANT SCOWL MISSUS RACHEL SIGHED SHE HAD HER SUSPICIONS ABOUT DAVY'S NECK AND EARS BUT SHE KNEW THAT IF SHE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A PERSONAL EXAMINATION
THE ARTS GRADUATES GAVE A GRADUATION DANCE THAT NIGHT WHEN ANNE DRESSED FOR IT SHE TOSSED ASIDE THE PEARL BEADS SHE USUALLY WORE AND TOOK FROM HER TRUNK THE SMALL BOX THAT HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES ON CHRISTMAS DAY IN IT WAS A THREAD LIKE GOLD CHAIN
ON THE TABLE LAY A LONG ENVELOPE AND A CRUMPLED MANUSCRIPT ANNE YOUR STORY HASN'T COME BACK CRIED DIANA INCREDULOUSLY YES IT HAS SAID ANNE SHORTLY
WE'VE LEARNED THE TRUTH OF WHAT PROFESSOR WOODLEIGH TOLD US LAST PHILOMATHIC SAID PHIL HE SAID HUMOR IS THE SPICIEST CONDIMENT IN THE FEAST OF EXISTENCE LAUGH AT YOUR MISTAKES BUT LEARN FROM THEM JOKE OVER YOUR TROUBLES BUT GATHER STRENGTH FROM THEM
PLEASING VISIONS WERE ALSO BEING WOVEN AROUND PATTY'S PLACE THERE WAS A WARM PLEASANT SENSE OF HOME IN THE THOUGHT OF IT EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER LIVED THERE BUT THE SUMMER HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY ONE TOO A TIME OF GLAD LIVING WITH SUMMER SUNS AND SKIES A TIME OF KEEN DELIGHT IN WHOLESOME THINGS
ONLY IT WILL BE EASIER TO BE GOOD AND TO FOLLOW THE HIGHEST ALL THE HINDRANCES AND PERPLEXITIES WILL BE TAKEN AWAY AND WE SHALL SEE CLEARLY DON'T BE AFRAID RUBY I CAN'T HELP IT SAID RUBY PITIFULLY
THE VERY IDEA OF YOUR BEING SCARED OF THOSE COWS SCOFFED DAVY WHY THEY'RE BOTH YOUNGER THAN YOU THEY'RE BIGGER SAID DORA THEY WON'T HURT YOU COME ALONG NOW THIS IS GREAT
THOMAS PUSSY SAID DAVY I THINK GENTLEMAN CAT WOULD BE MORE POLITE REFLECTED DORA YOU THINKING RETORTED DAVY WITH WITHERING SCORN DAVY WAS NOT FEELING COMFORTABLE
IF IT IS TRUE THAT SHE IS DYING ANY OTHER SAD THING MIGHT BE TRUE TOO
WOULD WIN ANY GIRL'S HEART COMPLETELY
NO THE EDITOR WOULDN'T TAKE IT SHE ANSWERED BRIEFLY MISTER HARRISON LOOKED SIDEWISE AT THE FLUSHED DELICATE PROFILE WELL I SUPPOSE YOU'LL KEEP ON WRITING THEM HE SAID ENCOURAGINGLY NO
FOR PRESENTLY SHE GREW CALMER AND HER SOBS CEASED
AND EVEN ON FINE DAYS IT DRIFTED UNCEASINGLY NO SOONER WERE THE ROADS BROKEN THAN THEY FILLED IN AGAIN IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STIR OUT THE A V I S TRIED ON THREE EVENINGS TO HAVE A PARTY IN HONOR OF THE COLLEGE STUDENTS
ANNE DROPPED HER LIDS TO HIDE HER DANCING EYES SHE RECALLED THE STORMY WINTER NIGHT OF THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS WHEN JANE HAD PROPOSED FOR BILLY HE CERTAINLY HAD NOT BROKEN HIS HEART OVER HIS REJECTION ANNE WONDERED IF JANE HAD ALSO PROPOSED TO NETTIE FOR HIM
SHE WAS EVEN HANDSOMER THAN EVER BUT HER BLUE EYES WERE TOO BRIGHT AND LUSTROUS AND THE COLOR OF HER CHEEKS WAS HECTICALLY BRILLIANT BESIDES SHE WAS VERY THIN THE HANDS THAT HELD HER HYMN BOOK WERE ALMOST TRANSPARENT IN THEIR DELICACY
RUBY SLIPPED HER ARM ABOUT ANNE'S WAIST WITH A SHALLOW LITTLE LAUGH BUT JUST FOR A MOMENT THEIR EYES MET AND BEHIND ALL THE LUSTER OF RUBY'S ANNE SAW SOMETHING THAT MADE HER HEART ACHE COME UP OFTEN WON'T YOU ANNE WHISPERED RUBY
I DON'T WANT TO DIE I'M AFRAID TO DIE WHY SHOULD YOU BE AFRAID RUBY ASKED ANNE QUIETLY BECAUSE BECAUSE OH I'M NOT AFRAID BUT THAT I'LL GO TO HEAVEN ANNE I'M A CHURCH MEMBER
SAID ANNE NEVER MIND I BEGIN FAINTLY TO DISCERN CLEAR WATER AHEAD WHERE NO EXAMINATION BREAKERS LOOM GIRLS DO YOU CAN YOU REALIZE THAT OUR REDMOND LIFE IS ALMOST OVER I CAN'T SAID ANNE SORROWFULLY
BUT HIS SOUL SEETHED WITHIN DAVY HAD SUFFERED OR THOUGHT HE HAD SUFFERED MANY THINGS AT THE HANDS AND TONGUE OF MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE SINCE SHE HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES FOR MISSUS LYNDE COULD NOT LIVE WITH ANYBODY WHETHER THEY WERE NINE OR NINETY
I WANT TO SEE WHAT THEM PESKY GRITS ARE DOING I'M A CONSERVATIVE ANNE AND I TELL YOU YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON THEM GRITS MISTER HARRISON HAD BROUGHT THE MAIL AND MERRY LETTERS FROM STELLA AND PRISCILLA AND PHIL SOON DISSIPATED ANNE'S BLUES AUNT JAMESINA TOO HAD WRITTEN
IT'S JUST WHAT ANYBODY MIGHT DO HEROINES SHOULDN'T DO COOKING I THINK WHY THAT IS WHERE THE HUMOR COMES IN AND IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF THE WHOLE STORY SAID ANNE AND IT MAY BE STATED THAT IN THIS SHE WAS QUITE RIGHT
WOULD YOU SMILED ANNE DAVY PEERED CURIOUSLY AT HER YOU DON'T SEEM A BIT SHOCKED ANNE MISSUS LYNDE WAS AWFUL SHOCKED WHEN I SAID IT TO HER NO I'M NOT SHOCKED DAVY
DON'T YOU TELL ME BUT IT WAS NOT AT JANE ANNE GAZED THAT DAY IN DISMAY AND SURPRISE IT WAS AT RUBY GILLIS WHO SAT BESIDE HER IN THE CHOIR WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO RUBY
THAT HER CARD WAS FULL WHEN HE CAME TO ASK HER FOR A DANCE AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE SAT WITH THE GIRLS BEFORE THE DYING EMBERS AT PATTY'S PLACE REMOVING THE SPRING CHILLINESS FROM THEIR SATIN SKINS NONE CHATTED MORE BLITHELY THAN SHE OF THE DAY'S EVENTS
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSOCIATE THE THOUGHT OF HER WITH ANYTHING LIKE DEATH SHE HAD GREETED ANNE WITH GAY CORDIALITY AFTER CHURCH AND URGED HER TO COME UP THE NEXT EVENING I'LL BE AWAY TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY EVENINGS SHE HAD WHISPERED TRIUMPHANTLY
AND ON EACH EVENING THE STORM WAS SO WILD THAT NOBODY COULD GO SO THEY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT IN DESPAIR ANNE DESPITE HER LOVE OF AND LOYALTY TO GREEN GABLES COULD NOT HELP THINKING LONGINGLY OF PATTY'S PLACE ITS COSY OPEN FIRE
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO END IT HAPPILY OR UNHAPPILY I'M NOT SURE
WELL ANYWAY IT'S A PERFECTLY ELEGANT STORY ANNE AND WILL MAKE YOU FAMOUS OF THAT I'M SURE HAVE YOU GOT A TITLE FOR IT
I'M VERY VERY SORRY I WONDER WHY EVERYBODY SEEMS TO THINK I OUGHT TO MARRY GILBERT BLYTHE SAID ANNE PETULANTLY
HENCE IT HAPPENS THAT THE REMAINDER DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TRUTH AND THAT SUCH AS REGULATE THEIR CONDUCT BY EXAMPLES DRAWN FROM THIS SOURCE ARE APT TO FALL INTO THE EXTRAVAGANCES OF THE KNIGHT ERRANTS OF ROMANCE AND TO ENTERTAIN PROJECTS THAT EXCEED THEIR POWERS
FOR EXAMPLE IF TOUCHED IN A PARTICULAR PLACE IT MAY DEMAND WHAT WE WISH TO SAY TO IT IF IN ANOTHER IT MAY CRY OUT THAT IT IS HURT AND SUCH LIKE
OR WITH SAVAGES AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN DRESS ITSELF THE FASHION WHICH PLEASED US TEN YEARS AGO AND WHICH MAY AGAIN PERHAPS BE RECEIVED INTO FAVOR BEFORE TEN YEARS HAVE GONE APPEARS TO US AT THIS MOMENT EXTRAVAGANT
WHICH BY BEING VARIOUSLY PERFORATED SERVE TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF GRAIN AND IN THE LAST PLACE WHAT ABOVE ALL IS HERE WORTHY OF OBSERVATION
THAN THEY ALREADY POSSESS AND IN THIS IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT ALL ARE MISTAKEN THE CONVICTION IS RATHER TO BE HELD AS TESTIFYING THAT THE POWER OF JUDGING ARIGHT AND OF DISTINGUISHING TRUTH FROM ERROR
THAT EVEN IF GOD HAD CREATED MORE WORLDS THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NONE IN WHICH THESE LAWS WERE NOT OBSERVED THEREAFTER I SHOWED HOW THE GREATEST PART OF THE MATTER OF THIS CHAOS MUST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE LAWS DISPOSE AND ARRANGE ITSELF IN SUCH A WAY
IN WHICH I FOUND NOTHING CERTAIN I THOUGHT IT NECESSARY FIRST OF ALL TO ENDEAVOR TO ESTABLISH ITS PRINCIPLES AND BECAUSE I OBSERVED
AND HAD WE ALWAYS BEEN GUIDED BY IT ALONE IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO PULL DOWN ALL THE HOUSES OF A TOWN WITH THE SINGLE DESIGN OF REBUILDING THEM DIFFERENTLY
I WILL NOT HESITATE HOWEVER TO AVOW MY BELIEF THAT IT HAS BEEN MY SINGULAR GOOD FORTUNE TO HAVE VERY EARLY IN LIFE FALLEN IN WITH CERTAIN TRACKS WHICH HAVE CONDUCTED ME TO CONSIDERATIONS AND MAXIMS OF WHICH I HAVE FORMED A METHOD THAT GIVES ME THE MEANS AS I THINK
BUT I HAD NOT AS YET A PRECISE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR TRUE USE AND THINKING THAT THEY BUT CONTRIBUTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE MECHANICAL ARTS I WAS ASTONISHED THAT FOUNDATIONS SO STRONG AND SOLID SHOULD HAVE HAD NO LOFTIER SUPERSTRUCTURE REARED ON THEM
AS CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SUPPOSITION EXIST IN THIS BODY I FOUND PRECISELY ALL THOSE WHICH MAY EXIST IN US INDEPENDENTLY
MATTER SUFFICIENT TO COMPOSE ONE AND WERE TO AGITATE VARIOUSLY AND CONFUSEDLY THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS MATTER SO THAT THERE RESULTED A CHAOS AS DISORDERED AS THE POETS EVER FEIGNED
THE BRIEFEST POSSIBLE IN THIS WAY I BELIEVED THAT I COULD BORROW ALL THAT WAS BEST BOTH IN GEOMETRICAL ANALYSIS AND IN ALGEBRA AND CORRECT ALL THE DEFECTS OF THE ONE BY HELP OF THE OTHER
THE SITUATION AND SHAPE OF ITS COUNTERWEIGHTS AND WHEELS BUT IF IT BE ASKED HOW IT HAPPENS THAT THE BLOOD IN THE VEINS FLOWING IN THIS WAY CONTINUALLY INTO THE HEART IS NOT EXHAUSTED
TO THE CONSIDERATION OF FIGURES THAT IT CAN EXERCISE THE UNDERSTANDING ONLY ON CONDITION OF GREATLY FATIGUING THE IMAGINATION AND IN THE LATTER THERE IS SO COMPLETE A SUBJECTION TO CERTAIN RULES AND FORMULAS
ARE USUALLY BUT ILL LAID OUT COMPARED WITH THE REGULARITY CONSTRUCTED TOWNS WHICH A PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT HAS FREELY PLANNED ON AN OPEN PLAIN SO THAT ALTHOUGH THE SEVERAL BUILDINGS OF THE FORMER
BECAUSE NO OTHER CAUSES ARE OBSERVED CAPABLE OF DESTROYING IT
WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF MEN OF THIS CLASS ONCE TAKE THE LIBERTY TO DOUBT OF THEIR ACCUSTOMED OPINIONS AND QUIT THE BEATEN HIGHWAY THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO THREAD THE BYWAY THAT WOULD LEAD THEM BY A SHORTER COURSE
I THOUGHT THAT IN ORDER THE BETTER TO CONSIDER THEM INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD VIEW THEM AS SUBSISTING BETWEEN STRAIGHT LINES THAN WHICH I COULD FIND NO OBJECTS MORE SIMPLE
AND RIDICULOUS I WAS THUS LED TO INFER THAT THE GROUND OF OUR OPINIONS IS FAR MORE CUSTOM AND EXAMPLE THAN ANY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE AND FINALLY ALTHOUGH SUCH BE THE GROUND OF OUR OPINIONS
PRESENTLY DISPERSE THEMSELVES ALL OVER THE LUNGS IN THE SECOND PLACE THE CAVITY IN THE LEFT SIDE
SO THAT EVEN ALTHOUGH HE HAD FROM THE BEGINNING GIVEN IT NO OTHER FORM THAN THAT OF CHAOS PROVIDED ONLY HE HAD ESTABLISHED CERTAIN LAWS OF NATURE AND HAD LENT IT HIS CONCURRENCE TO ENABLE IT TO ACT AS IT IS WONT TO DO
THAT BY ITS USE MY MIND WAS BECOMING GRADUALLY HABITUATED TO CLEARER AND MORE DISTINCT CONCEPTIONS OF ITS OBJECTS AND I HOPED ALSO FROM NOT HAVING RESTRICTED THIS METHOD TO ANY PARTICULAR MATTER TO APPLY IT TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE OTHER SCIENCES
I CAME NEXT TO SPEAK OF THE EARTH IN PARTICULAR AND TO SHOW HOW EVEN THOUGH I HAD EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT GOD HAD GIVEN NO WEIGHT TO THE MATTER OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THIS SHOULD NOT PREVENT ALL ITS PARTS FROM TENDING EXACTLY
AND EVEN THE MOST FAITHFUL HISTORIES IF THEY DO NOT WHOLLY MISREPRESENT MATTERS OR EXAGGERATE THEIR IMPORTANCE TO RENDER THE ACCOUNT OF THEM MORE WORTHY OF PERUSAL OMIT AT LEAST ALMOST ALWAYS THE MEANEST AND LEAST STRIKING OF THE ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES
BUT PREVENT ITS REFLUX NOR DO WE NEED TO SEEK ANY OTHER REASON FOR THE NUMBER OF THESE PELLICLES BEYOND THIS THAT THE ORIFICE OF THE VENOUS ARTERY BEING OF AN OVAL SHAPE FROM THE NATURE OF ITS SITUATION CAN BE ADEQUATELY CLOSED WITH TWO
INCLUDES ALL THAT GIVES CERTITUDE TO THE RULES OF ARITHMETIC BUT THE CHIEF GROUND OF MY SATISFACTION WITH THUS METHOD
AND BE PREVENTED FROM THINKING THAT EVERYTHING CONTRARY TO OUR CUSTOMS IS RIDICULOUS AND IRRATIONAL A CONCLUSION USUALLY COME TO BY THOSE WHOSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN TOO MUCH TIME IS OCCUPIED IN TRAVELING
OR INSENSIBLY CORRECTED A NUMBER WHICH SAGACITY COULD NOT HAVE PROVIDED AGAINST WITH EQUAL EFFECT AND IN FINE THE DEFECTS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS MORE TOLERABLE
FROM COMING FORWARD THROUGH THE ARTERIES BECAUSE THESE ARE SITUATED BELOW THE VEINS AND THEIR COVERINGS FROM THEIR GREATER CONSISTENCY ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO COMPRESS AND ALSO THAT THE BLOOD WHICH COMES FROM THE HEART TENDS TO PASS THROUGH THEM
I SHOULD MUCH BETTER SUCCEED IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE THAN IF I BUILT ONLY UPON OLD FOUNDATIONS AND LEANED UPON PRINCIPLES WHICH IN MY YOUTH I HAD TAKEN UPON TRUST
BUT THIS IS CERTAIN AND AN OPINION COMMONLY RECEIVED AMONG THEOLOGIANS THAT THE ACTION BY WHICH HE NOW SUSTAINS IT IS THE SAME WITH THAT BY WHICH HE ORIGINALLY CREATED IT
THE LONG CHAINS OF SIMPLE AND EASY REASONINGS BY MEANS OF WHICH GEOMETERS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO REACH THE CONCLUSIONS OF THEIR MOST DIFFICULT DEMONSTRATIONS
USING HIS NATURAL AND UNPREJUDICED JUDGMENT DRAWS RESPECTING THE MATTERS OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL TO PASS THROUGH A STATE OF INFANCY TO MANHOOD AND HAVE BEEN OF NECESSITY FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
TREATING OF SUCH BRANCHES AS ARE ESTEEMED THE MOST CURIOUS AND RARE I KNEW THE JUDGMENT WHICH OTHERS HAD FORMED OF ME AND I DID NOT FIND THAT I WAS CONSIDERED INFERIOR TO MY FELLOWS
BUT I BELIEVED THAT I HAD ALREADY GIVEN SUFFICIENT TIME TO LANGUAGES AND LIKEWISE TO THE READING OF THE WRITINGS OF THE ANCIENTS TO THEIR HISTORIES AND FABLES
THE PARTICULAR SCIENCES COMMONLY DENOMINATED MATHEMATICS BUT OBSERVING THAT HOWEVER DIFFERENT THEIR OBJECTS THEY ALL AGREE IN CONSIDERING ONLY THE VARIOUS RELATIONS OR PROPORTIONS
TRUE REASONS FROM MERE VERISIMILITUDES SHOULD VENTURE WITHOUT EXAMINATION TO DENY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID I WISH IT TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THE MOTION WHICH I HAVE NOW EXPLAINED FOLLOWS AS NECESSARILY
I REMARKED THAT A PLURALITY OF SUFFRAGES IS NO GUARANTEE OF TRUTH WHERE IT IS AT ALL OF DIFFICULT DISCOVERY AS IN SUCH CASES IT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT IT WILL BE FOUND BY ONE THAN BY MANY
TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDING SOMETHING ON THE SUN AND THE FIXED STARS SINCE LIGHT ALMOST WHOLLY PROCEEDS FROM THEM ON THE HEAVENS SINCE THEY TRANSMIT IT ON THE PLANETS COMETS AND EARTH SINCE THEY REFLECT IT AND PARTICULARLY
OR WHEN THE FOUNDATIONS ARE INSECURE WITH THIS BEFORE ME BY WAY OF EXAMPLE I WAS PERSUADED THAT IT WOULD INDEED BE PREPOSTEROUS FOR A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL TO THINK OF REFORMING A STATE BY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING IT THROUGHOUT
THE OPENING VERY TIGHT FOR IT IS MANIFEST THAT THE TIE MODERATELY STRAIGHTENED WHILE ADEQUATE TO HINDER THE BLOOD ALREADY IN THE ARM FROM RETURNING TOWARDS THE HEART BY THE VEINS CANNOT ON THAT ACCOUNT PREVENT NEW BLOOD
AS ALSO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SOUL OF MAN AND THAT OF THE BRUTES AND IN THE LAST WHAT THE AUTHOR BELIEVES TO BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO GREATER ADVANCEMENT IN THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE THAN HAS YET BEEN MADE WITH THE REASONS THAT HAVE INDUCED HIM TO WRITE
SHOULD NOT IN THIS BE EQUAL TO THE MOST STUPID INFANT OF ITS KIND OR AT LEAST TO ONE THAT WAS CRACK BRAINED UNLESS THE SOUL OF BRUTES
OF GRADUALLY AUGMENTING MY KNOWLEDGE AND OF RAISING IT BY LITTLE AND LITTLE TO THE HIGHEST POINT WHICH THE MEDIOCRITY OF MY TALENTS AND THE BRIEF DURATION OF MY LIFE WILL PERMIT ME TO REACH FOR I HAVE ALREADY REAPED FROM IT SUCH FRUITS THAT
ON THE OTHER HAND I COMPARED THE DISQUISITIONS OF THE ANCIENT MORALISTS TO VERY TOWERING AND MAGNIFICENT PALACES WITH NO BETTER FOUNDATION THAN SAND AND MUD THEY LAUD THE VIRTUES VERY HIGHLY AND EXHIBIT THEM AS ESTIMABLE FAR ABOVE ANYTHING ON EARTH
AND ALTHOUGH THIS SCIENCE CONTAINS INDEED A NUMBER OF CORRECT AND VERY EXCELLENT PRECEPTS THERE ARE NEVERTHELESS SO MANY OTHERS AND THESE
AND THERE OCCUPY THE PLACE OF SOME OTHERS EXPELLED BY THEM AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION SHAPE OR SMALLNESS OF THE PORES WITH WHICH THEY MEET SOME RATHER THAN OTHERS FLOW INTO CERTAIN PARTS
I ESTEEMED ELOQUENCE HIGHLY AND WAS IN RAPTURES WITH POESY BUT I THOUGHT THAT BOTH WERE GIFTS OF NATURE RATHER THAN FRUITS OF STUDY THOSE IN WHOM THE FACULTY OF REASON IS PREDOMINANT AND WHO MOST SKILLFULLY DISPOSE THEIR THOUGHTS WITH A VIEW TO RENDER THEM CLEAR AND INTELLIGIBLE
I SHOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BELONGED TO THE LATTER CLASS HAD I RECEIVED INSTRUCTION FROM BUT ONE MASTER OR HAD I NEVER KNOWN THE DIVERSITIES OF OPINION THAT FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL HAVE PREVAILED AMONG MEN OF THE GREATEST LEARNING
EITHER INJURIOUS OR SUPERFLUOUS MINGLED WITH THE FORMER THAT IT IS ALMOST QUITE AS DIFFICULT TO EFFECT A SEVERANCE OF THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE AS IT IS TO EXTRACT A DIANA OR A MINERVA FROM A ROUGH BLOCK OF MARBLE
I HAVE NEVER CONTEMPLATED ANYTHING HIGHER THAN THE REFORMATION OF MY OWN OPINIONS AND BASING THEM ON A FOUNDATION WHOLLY MY OWN AND ALTHOUGH MY OWN SATISFACTION WITH MY WORK HAS LED ME TO PRESENT HERE A DRAFT OF IT
AND WE OUGHT NOT TO CONFOUND SPEECH WITH THE NATURAL MOVEMENTS WHICH INDICATE THE PASSIONS AND CAN BE IMITATED BY MACHINES AS WELL AS MANIFESTED BY ANIMALS NOR MUST IT BE THOUGHT WITH CERTAIN OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE BRUTES SPEAK ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE
IN PARTS MORE REMOTE FROM IT IN THE NEXT PLACE
WHILE BUSIED ONLY IN CONSIDERING THE MANNERS OF OTHER MEN I FOUND HERE TOO SCARCE ANY GROUND FOR SETTLED CONVICTION AND REMARKED HARDLY LESS CONTRADICTION AMONG THEM THAN IN THE OPINIONS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS
I HAD EXPOUNDED ALL THESE MATTERS WITH SUFFICIENT MINUTENESS IN THE TREATISE WHICH I FORMERLY THOUGHT OF PUBLISHING AND AFTER THESE I HAD SHOWN WHAT MUST BE THE FABRIC OF THE NERVES AND MUSCLES OF THE HUMAN BODY
AND IN POINT OF FACT THE ACCURATE OBSERVANCE OF THESE FEW PRECEPTS GAVE ME I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF SAYING SUCH EASE IN UNRAVELING ALL THE QUESTIONS EMBRACED IN THESE TWO SCIENCES
CONSISTS IN THINKING FUNCTIONS IN WHICH THE ANIMALS VOID OF REASON MAY BE SAID WHOLLY TO RESEMBLE US BUT AMONG WHICH I COULD NOT DISCOVER ANY OF THOSE THAT AS DEPENDENT ON THOUGHT ALONE BELONG TO US AS MEN
TO SATISFY MYSELF IN A SHORT TIME ON ALL THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ARE USUALLY TREATED OF IN PHILOSOPHY BUT I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED CERTAIN LAWS ESTABLISHED IN NATURE BY GOD IN SUCH A MANNER
I MIGHT ASCEND BY LITTLE AND LITTLE AND AS IT WERE STEP BY STEP TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MORE COMPLEX ASSIGNING IN THOUGHT A CERTAIN ORDER EVEN TO THOSE OBJECTS WHICH IN THEIR OWN NATURE DO NOT STAND IN A RELATION OF ANTECEDENCE AND SEQUENCE
WHICH I DID NOT CLEARLY KNOW TO BE SUCH THAT IS TO SAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID PRECIPITANCY AND PREJUDICE AND TO COMPRISE NOTHING MORE IN MY JUDGEMENT THAN WHAT WAS PRESENTED
THEN AS TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE ANCIENTS AND THE ALGEBRA OF THE MODERNS BESIDES THAT THEY EMBRACE ONLY MATTERS HIGHLY ABSTRACT AND TO APPEARANCE OF NO USE THE FORMER IS SO EXCLUSIVELY RESTRICTED
AND MORE VIVID AND WARMER IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE HEART IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IN THE ARTERIES THAN IT WAS A SHORT TIME BEFORE PASSING INTO EITHER IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IT WAS IN THE VEINS
IN THE MOST DIRECT LINES AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MECHANICS WHICH ARE THE SAME WITH THOSE OF NATURE WHEN MANY OBJECTS TEND AT ONCE TO THE SAME POINT
AND ADEQUATE TO MOVEMENTS MORE ADMIRABLE THAN IS ANY MACHINE OF HUMAN INVENTION AND HERE I SPECIALLY STAYED TO SHOW THAT WERE THERE SUCH MACHINES EXACTLY RESEMBLING ORGANS AND OUTWARD FORM AN APE OR ANY OTHER IRRATIONAL ANIMAL
AND OF HAVING BEEN THE FIRST TO TEACH THAT THERE ARE MANY SMALL PASSAGES AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES THROUGH WHICH THE BLOOD RECEIVED BY THEM FROM THE HEART PASSES INTO THE SMALL BRANCHES OF THE VEINS
THAT I CANNOT IN ANY DEGREE APPROVE OF THOSE RESTLESS AND BUSY MEDDLERS WHO CALLED NEITHER BY BIRTH NOR FORTUNE TO TAKE PART IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS ARE YET ALWAYS PROJECTING REFORMS
I EXPOUNDED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH WHAT THE NATURE OF THAT LIGHT MUST BE
AND OF WHICH HE HAS IMPRESSED ON OUR MINDS SUCH NOTIONS THAT AFTER WE HAVE REFLECTED SUFFICIENTLY UPON THESE WE CANNOT DOUBT THAT THEY ARE ACCURATELY OBSERVED IN ALL THAT EXISTS OR TAKES PLACE IN THE WORLD AND FARTHER BY CONSIDERING
BUT SINCE I HAD NOT AS YET SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE TO ENABLE ME TO TREAT OF THESE IN THE SAME MANNER AS OF THE REST THAT IS TO SAY BY DEDUCING EFFECTS FROM THEIR CAUSES AND BY SHOWING
IT MAY BE BELIEVED WITHOUT DISCREDIT TO THE MIRACLE OF CREATION THAT IN THIS WAY ALONE THINGS PURELY MATERIAL MIGHT IN COURSE OF TIME
SUBSISTING AMONG THOSE OBJECTS I THOUGHT IT BEST FOR MY PURPOSE TO CONSIDER THESE PROPORTIONS IN THE MOST GENERAL FORM POSSIBLE WITHOUT REFERRING THEM TO ANY OBJECTS IN PARTICULAR
SO THAT A STATE IS BEST GOVERNED WHEN WITH FEW LAWS THESE ARE RIGIDLY ADMINISTERED IN LIKE MANNER INSTEAD OF THE GREAT NUMBER OF PRECEPTS OF WHICH LOGIC IS COMPOSED I BELIEVED THAT THE FOUR FOLLOWING WOULD PROVE PERFECTLY SUFFICIENT FOR ME
CAN NUMBER THE HOURS AND MEASURE TIME MORE EXACTLY THAN WE WITH ALL OUR SKIN I HAD AFTER THIS DESCRIBED THE REASONABLE SOUL AND SHOWN THAT IT COULD BY NO MEANS BE EDUCED FROM THE POWER OF MATTER
AND BY WHOM THEY MAY BE INSTRUCTED OUGHT RATHER TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THE OPINIONS OF SUCH THAN TRUST FOR MORE CORRECT TO THEIR OWN REASON FOR MY OWN PART
AND IN ESSAYING TO GATHER SOME EXPERIENCE I AT LENGTH RESOLVED TO MAKE MYSELF AN OBJECT OF STUDY AND TO EMPLOY ALL THE POWERS OF MY MIND IN CHOOSING THE PATHS I OUGHT TO FOLLOW
ALTHOUGH THERE WERE AMONG THEM SOME WHO WERE ALREADY MARKED OUT TO FILL THE PLACES OF OUR INSTRUCTORS AND IN FINE OUR AGE APPEARED TO ME AS FLOURISHING AND AS FERTILE IN POWERFUL MINDS AS ANY PRECEDING ONE
PROBABLE REASONINGS WITHOUT DEMONSTRATIONS COMPOSED AS THEY ARE OF THE OPINIONS OF MANY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS MASSED TOGETHER ARE FARTHER REMOVED FROM TRUTH THAN THE SIMPLE INFERENCES WHICH A MAN OF GOOD SENSE
AND OVERTURNING IT IN ORDER TO SET IT UP AMENDED AND THE SAME I THOUGHT WAS TRUE OF ANY SIMILAR PROJECT FOR REFORMING THE BODY OF THE SCIENCES OR THE ORDER OF TEACHING THEM ESTABLISHED IN THE SCHOOLS
BECAUSE THE ORIFICES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS ARE WIDE
AND ESSAYED TO REPRESENT IT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT TO MY MIND THERE CAN BE NOTHING CLEARER AND MORE INTELLIGIBLE EXCEPT WHAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY SAID REGARDING GOD AND THE SOUL
THESE ORGANS ON THE CONTRARY NEED A PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR ACTION WHENCE IT MUST BE MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD EXIST IN ANY MACHINE A DIVERSITY OF ORGANS SUFFICIENT
IN HOLDING INTERCOURSE WITH MEN OF DIFFERENT DISPOSITIONS AND RANKS IN COLLECTING VARIED EXPERIENCE IN PROVING MYSELF IN THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS INTO WHICH FORTUNE THREW ME AND ABOVE ALL
VENOUS ARTERY OPEN ANEW AND ALLOW A PASSAGE
AND ALL THE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF THESE HEAVENS AND STARS SO THAT I THOUGHT I HAD SAID ENOUGH RESPECTING THEM TO SHOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING OBSERVABLE IN THE HEAVENS OR STARS OF OUR SYSTEM THAT MUST NOT OR AT LEAST MAY NOT APPEAR PRECISELY ALIKE IN THOSE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH I DESCRIBED
OUR THOUGHTS TO OTHERS FOR WE MAY EASILY CONCEIVE A MACHINE TO BE SO CONSTRUCTED THAT IT EMITS VOCABLES AND EVEN THAT IT EMITS SOME CORRESPONDENT TO THE ACTION UPON IT OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS WHICH CAUSE A CHANGE IN ITS ORGANS
BUT I SHALL ENDEAVOR IN THIS DISCOURSE TO DESCRIBE THE PATHS I HAVE FOLLOWED AND TO DELINEATE MY LIFE AS IN A PICTURE IN ORDER THAT EACH ONE MAY ALSO BE ABLE TO JUDGE OF THEM FOR HIMSELF AND THAT IN THE GENERAL OPINION ENTERTAINED OF THEM AS GATHERED FROM CURRENT REPORT
I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS THEREFORE RECOMMEND TO EVERY ONE ELSE TO MAKE A SIMILAR ATTEMPT THOSE WHOM GOD HAS ENDOWED WITH A LARGER MEASURE OF GENIUS WILL ENTERTAIN PERHAPS DESIGNS STILL MORE EXALTED
AND WAS BESIDES FORTUNATELY UNDISTURBED BY ANY CARES OR PASSIONS I REMAINED THE WHOLE DAY IN SECLUSION WITH FULL OPPORTUNITY TO OCCUPY MY ATTENTION WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS
I RESOLVED TO LEAVE ALL THE PEOPLE HERE TO THEIR DISPUTES AND TO SPEAK ONLY OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A NEW WORLD IF GOD WERE NOW TO CREATE SOMEWHERE IN THE IMAGINARY SPACES
AND BY CONTINUALLY EXERCISING MYSELF IN MY CHOSEN METHOD
AND TO HAVE SHOWN TO THEM ITS TWO VENTRICLES OR CAVITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WITH WHICH CORRESPOND TWO VERY AMPLE TUBES VIZ THE HOLLOW VEIN VENA CAVA
IN THIS INSTANCE IS WITHIN THE REACH OF HUMAN GENIUS NOW IN CONCLUSION THE METHOD WHICH TEACHES ADHERENCE TO THE TRUE ORDER AND AN EXACT ENUMERATION OF ALL THE CONDITIONS OF THE THING SOUGHT
TO SHOW HOW IT CAN INDUCE VARIOUS COLORS UPON DIFFERENT BODIES AND OTHER DIVERSE QUALITIES HOW IT REDUCES SOME TO A LIQUID STATE AND HARDENS OTHERS HOW IT CAN CONSUME ALMOST ALL BODIES OR CONVERT THEM INTO ASHES AND SMOKE
FOR NEITHER OF WHICH WOULD THIS BE AT ALL A BEFITTING RESOLUTION IN THE FIRST PLACE OF THOSE WHO WITH MORE THAN A DUE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN POWERS ARE PRECIPITATE IN THEIR JUDGMENTS AND WANT THE PATIENCE REQUISITE FOR ORDERLY AND CIRCUMSPECT THINKING
PREFATORY NOTE BY THE AUTHOR IF THIS DISCOURSE APPEAR TOO LONG TO BE READ AT ONCE IT MAY BE DIVIDED INTO SIX PARTS
I HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE OBJECTS WITH WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO COMMENCE FOR I WAS ALREADY PERSUADED THAT IT MUST BE WITH THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW AND CONSIDERING THAT OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE HITHERTO SOUGHT
OF PHILOSOPHY I WILL SAY NOTHING EXCEPT THAT WHEN I SAW THAT IT HAD BEEN CULTIVATED FOR MANY AGES BY THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN AND THAT YET THERE IS NOT A SINGLE MATTER WITHIN ITS SPHERE WHICH IS NOT STILL IN DISPUTE
WHEREAS THE OTHERS BEING ROUND ARE MORE CONVENIENTLY CLOSED WITH THREE BESIDES I WISH SUCH PERSONS TO OBSERVE THAT THE GRAND ARTERY AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN ARE OF MUCH HARDER AND FIRMER TEXTURE
NATURE MUST PRODUCE THEM I REMAINED SATISFIED WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT GOD FORMED THE BODY OF MAN WHOLLY LIKE TO ONE OF OURS AS WELL IN THE EXTERNAL SHAPE OF THE MEMBERS AS IN THE INTERNAL CONFORMATION OF THE ORGANS
FEARING LEST I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPENSE IN MY DISCOURSE ALL THAT WAS IN MY MIND I RESOLVED TO EXPOUND SINGLY THOUGH AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH MY OPINIONS REGARDING LIGHT THEN
TWO OTHERS AT THE MOUTH OF THE VENOUS ARTERY WHICH ALLOW THE BLOOD FROM THE LUNGS TO FLOW INTO THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART BUT PRECLUDE ITS RETURN AND THREE AT THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH SUFFER THE BLOOD TO FLOW FROM THE HEART
FOR ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZED VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES IN THIS UNDERTAKING THESE WERE NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT REMEDY NOR ONCE TO BE COMPARED WITH SUCH AS ATTEND THE SLIGHTEST REFORMATION IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS LARGE BODIES
AND WHO CAN GIVE EXPRESSION TO THEM WITH THE GREATEST EMBELLISHMENT AND HARMONY ARE STILL THE BEST POETS THOUGH UNACQUAINTED WITH THE ART OF POETRY I WAS ESPECIALLY DELIGHTED WITH THE MATHEMATICS ON ACCOUNT OF THE CERTITUDE AND EVIDENCE OF THEIR REASONINGS
I YET MADE VERY SLIGHT ACCOUNT OF THAT HONOR WHICH I HOPED TO ACQUIRE ONLY THROUGH FICTITIOUS TITLES AND IN FINE OF FALSE SCIENCES I THOUGHT I KNEW THE WORTH SUFFICIENTLY TO ESCAPE BEING DECEIVED BY THE PROFESSIONS OF AN ALCHEMIST THE PREDICTIONS OF AN ASTROLOGER
AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN WERE IT NOT THAT THE BLOOD OF THE VENOUS ARTERY HAVING ONLY BEEN IN THE LUNGS AFTER IT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE HEART IS THINNER AND RAREFIES MORE READILY AND IN A HIGHER DEGREE
BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS I WAS INDUCED TO SEEK SOME OTHER METHOD WHICH WOULD COMPRISE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE THREE AND BE EXEMPT FROM THEIR DEFECTS AND AS A MULTITUDE OF LAWS OFTEN ONLY HAMPERS JUSTICE
AND THEREBY RENDERING THE STREETS MORE HANDSOME BUT IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL TAKES DOWN HIS OWN WITH THE VIEW OF ERECTING IT ANEW AND THAT PEOPLE ARE EVEN SOMETIMES CONSTRAINED TO THIS WHEN THEIR HOUSES ARE IN DANGER OF FALLING FROM AGE
APPOSITELY TO REPLY TO WHAT IS SAID IN ITS PRESENCE AS MEN OF THE LOWEST GRADE OF INTELLECT CAN DO THE SECOND TEST IS THAT ALTHOUGH SUCH MACHINES MIGHT EXECUTE MANY THINGS WITH EQUAL OR PERHAPS GREATER PERFECTION THAN ANY OF US
AND FINALLY HOW FROM THESE ASHES
AND IT IS BUT A LITTLE COPPER AND GLASS PERHAPS THAT I TAKE FOR GOLD AND DIAMONDS I KNOW HOW VERY LIABLE WE ARE TO DELUSION IN WHAT RELATES TO OURSELVES AND ALSO HOW MUCH THE JUDGMENTS OF OUR FRIENDS ARE TO BE SUSPECTED WHEN GIVEN IN OUR FAVOR
THIRST AND THE OTHER INTERNAL AFFECTIONS CAN LIKEWISE IMPRESS UPON IT DIVERS IDEAS WHAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE COMMON SENSE SENSUS COMMUNIS IN WHICH THESE IDEAS ARE RECEIVED BY THE MEMORY WHICH RETAINS THEM
FORCED UPON THEM SIMPLY BY EXPERIENCE OF THE HURTFULNESS OF PARTICULAR CRIMES AND DISPUTES WOULD BY THIS PROCESS COME TO BE POSSESSED OF LESS PERFECT INSTITUTIONS THAN THOSE WHICH FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THEIR ASSOCIATION AS COMMUNITIES
I GRADUALLY EXTRICATED MYSELF FROM MANY ERRORS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DARKEN OUR NATURAL INTELLIGENCE AND INCAPACITATE US IN GREAT MEASURE FROM LISTENING TO REASON BUT AFTER I HAD BEEN OCCUPIED SEVERAL YEARS IN THUS STUDYING THE BOOK OF THE WORLD
AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE DIFFERENT HUMORS OF THE BODY BEYOND SAYING THAT THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE BLOOD IN BEING RAREFIED PASSES FROM THE HEART TOWARDS THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES CAUSES CERTAIN OF ITS PARTS TO REMAIN IN THE MEMBERS AT WHICH THEY ARRIVE
PART TWO I WAS THEN IN GERMANY ATTRACTED THITHER BY THE WARS IN THAT COUNTRY WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN BROUGHT TO A TERMINATION AND AS I WAS RETURNING TO THE ARMY FROM THE CORONATION OF THE EMPEROR
THE SINGLE DESIGN TO STRIP ONE'S SELF OF ALL PAST BELIEFS IS ONE THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE TAKEN BY EVERY ONE THE MAJORITY OF MEN IS COMPOSED OF TWO CLASSES
WAKING SLEEP AND DREAMS HOW LIGHT SOUNDS ODORS TASTES HEAT AND ALL THE OTHER QUALITIES OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS IMPRESS IT WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS BY MEANS OF THE SENSES HOW HUNGER
ONLY THEIR CHOICEST THOUGHTS THAT ELOQUENCE HAS INCOMPARABLE FORCE AND BEAUTY THAT POESY HAS ITS RAVISHING GRACES AND DELIGHTS THAT IN THE MATHEMATICS THERE ARE MANY REFINED DISCOVERIES EMINENTLY SUITED TO GRATIFY THE INQUISITIVE
I FANCIED THAT THOSE NATIONS WHICH STARTING FROM A SEMI BARBAROUS STATE AND ADVANCING TO CIVILIZATION BY SLOW DEGREES HAVE HAD THEIR LAWS SUCCESSIVELY DETERMINED AND AS IT WERE
AS TO PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF HEAVENS HOW IN THE MEANTIME SOME OF ITS PARTS MUST COMPOSE AN EARTH AND SOME PLANETS AND COMETS AND OTHERS A SUN AND FIXED STARS AND MAKING A DIGRESSION AT THIS STAGE ON THE SUBJECT OF LIGHT
WHICH ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF HIS METAPHYSIC IN THE FIFTH THE ORDER OF THE PHYSICAL QUESTIONS WHICH HE HAS INVESTIGATED AND IN PARTICULAR THE EXPLICATION OF THE MOTION OF THE HEART AND OF SOME OTHER DIFFICULTIES PERTAINING TO MEDICINE
WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF THE BLOOD BE WITHDRAWN FROM ANY PART THE HEAT IS LIKEWISE WITHDRAWN BY THE SAME MEANS AND ALTHOUGH THE HEART WERE AS HOT AS GLOWING IRON IT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF WARMING THE FEET AND HANDS
AND WITHOUT BY ANY MEANS RESTRICTING THEM TO THESE THAT AFTERWARDS I MIGHT THUS BE THE BETTER ABLE TO APPLY THEM TO EVERY OTHER CLASS OF OBJECTS TO WHICH THEY ARE LEGITIMATELY APPLICABLE
I HAD ALWAYS A MOST EARNEST DESIRE TO KNOW HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE CLEARLY TO DISCRIMINATE THE RIGHT PATH IN LIFE AND PROCEED IN IT WITH CONFIDENCE IT IS TRUE THAT
CAUSE THE BLOOD TO FLOW MORE COPIOUSLY THAN IT WOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT ANY LIGATURE WHEREAS QUITE THE CONTRARY WOULD HAPPEN WERE THEY TO BIND IT BELOW THAT IS BETWEEN THE HAND AND THE OPENING OR WERE TO MAKE THE LIGATURE ABOVE
OF THESE ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THAT OCCURRED TO ME WAS THAT THERE IS SELDOM SO MUCH PERFECTION IN WORKS COMPOSED OF MANY SEPARATE PARTS
HAVE FOLLOWED THE APPOINTMENTS OF SOME WISE LEGISLATOR IT IS THUS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE TRUE RELIGION THE ORDINANCES OF WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM GOD MUST BE INCOMPARABLY SUPERIOR TO THAT OF EVERY OTHER
IF SUCH WERE ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND I HAD BEEN TAUGHT ALL THAT OTHERS LEARNED THERE AND NOT CONTENTED WITH THE SCIENCES ACTUALLY TAUGHT US I HAD IN ADDITION READ ALL THE BOOKS THAT HAD FALLEN INTO MY HANDS
BUT I HAD BECOME AWARE EVEN SO EARLY AS DURING MY COLLEGE LIFE THAT NO OPINION HOWEVER ABSURD AND INCREDIBLE CAN BE IMAGINED WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MAINTAINED BY SOME ON OF THE PHILOSOPHERS AND AFTERWARDS
THERE WILL BE FOUND PERHAPS AS MANY MORE WHICH IT WERE ADVISABLE NOT TO FOLLOW I HOPE IT WILL PROVE USEFUL TO SOME WITHOUT BEING HURTFUL TO ANY AND THAT MY OPENNESS WILL FIND SOME FAVOR WITH ALL
I MYSELF MAY HAVE A NEW HELP TOWARDS INSTRUCTION TO BE ADDED TO THOSE I HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF EMPLOYING MY PRESENT DESIGN THEN IS NOT TO TEACH THE METHOD WHICH EACH OUGHT TO FOLLOW FOR THE RIGHT CONDUCT OF HIS REASON
THAT IN THE TWO OR THREE MONTHS I DEVOTED TO THEIR EXAMINATION NOT ONLY DID I REACH SOLUTIONS OF QUESTIONS I HAD FORMERLY DEEMED EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT BUT EVEN AS REGARDS QUESTIONS OF THE SOLUTION OF WHICH I CONTINUED IGNORANT
AS THE OTHER THINGS OF WHICH I HAD SPOKEN BUT THAT IT MUST BE EXPRESSLY CREATED AND THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT IT BE LODGED IN THE HUMAN BODY EXACTLY LIKE A PILOT IN A SHIP UNLESS PERHAPS TO MOVE ITS MEMBERS
ON ALL THE BODIES THAT ARE UPON THE EARTH SINCE THEY ARE EITHER COLORED OR TRANSPARENT OR LUMINOUS AND FINALLY ON MAN SINCE HE IS THE SPECTATOR OF THESE OBJECTS
THAT THERE ARE NO MEN SO DULL AND STUPID NOT EVEN IDIOTS AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF JOINING TOGETHER DIFFERENT WORDS AND THEREBY CONSTRUCTING A DECLARATION BY WHICH TO MAKE THEIR THOUGHTS UNDERSTOOD
EMPLOYED MUCH OF MY TIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE WORK AS WELL BY ERADICATING FROM MY MIND ALL THE ERRONEOUS OPINIONS I HAD UP TO THAT MOMENT ACCEPTED AS BY AMASSING VARIETY OF EXPERIENCE TO AFFORD MATERIALS FOR MY REASONINGS
WHICH IS IN THE BODY MAY FLOW OUT OF IT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THROUGH A SINGLE ARTERY THAT HAS BEEN CUT
AND DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE BRUTES I AM DISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS TO BE FOUND COMPLETE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL AND ON THIS POINT TO ADOPT THE COMMON OPINION OF PHILOSOPHERS WHO SAY THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF GREATER AND LESS HOLDS ONLY AMONG THE ACCIDENTS
IN MAKING SUCH REFLECTION ON THE MATTER OF MY EXPERIENCE AS TO SECURE MY IMPROVEMENT FOR IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD FIND MUCH MORE TRUTH IN THE REASONINGS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL WITH REFERENCE TO THE AFFAIRS IN WHICH HE IS PERSONALLY INTERESTED
PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BRAIN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN SIMPLY THAT THE ARTERIES WHICH CARRY THEM THITHER PROCEED FROM THE HEART
AND IF ATTENTION BE GIVEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HEART
ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THINK LOWLY ENOUGH OF MYSELF AND ALTHOUGH WHEN I LOOK WITH THE EYE OF A PHILOSOPHER AT THE VARIED COURSES AND PURSUITS OF MANKIND AT LARGE I FIND SCARCELY ONE WHICH DOES NOT APPEAR IN VAIN AND USELESS
AND THAT MANY SUCH EXIST THE DIVERSITY OF CONSTITUTIONS IS ALONE SUFFICIENT TO ASSURE US CUSTOM HAS WITHOUT DOUBT MATERIALLY SMOOTHED THEIR INCONVENIENCES AND HAS EVEN MANAGED TO STEER ALTOGETHER CLEAR OF
WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO SEE THAT PRIVATE BUILDINGS CONTRIBUTED TO PUBLIC ORNAMENT THE DIFFICULTY OF REACHING HIGH PERFECTION WITH BUT THE MATERIALS OF OTHERS TO OPERATE ON WILL BE READILY ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE SAME WAY
IF READ WITH DISCRETION AID IN FORMING THE JUDGMENT THAT THE PERUSAL OF ALL EXCELLENT BOOKS IS AS IT WERE TO INTERVIEW WITH THE NOBLEST MEN OF PAST AGES WHO HAVE WRITTEN THEM AND EVEN A STUDIED INTERVIEW IN WHICH ARE DISCOVERED TO US
BUT AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THE ENTIRE COURSE OF STUDY AT THE CLOSE OF WHICH IT IS CUSTOMARY TO BE ADMITTED INTO THE ORDER OF THE LEARNED I COMPLETELY CHANGED MY OPINION FOR I FOUND MYSELF INVOLVED IN SO MANY DOUBTS AND ERRORS
BUT SOLELY TO DESCRIBE THE WAY IN WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO CONDUCT MY OWN THEY WHO SET THEMSELVES TO GIVE PRECEPTS MUST OF COURSE REGARD THEMSELVES AS POSSESSED OF GREATER SKILL THAN THOSE TO WHOM THEY PRESCRIBE
TRUTH IN THE SCIENCES THE MATHEMATICIANS ALONE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY DEMONSTRATIONS THAT IS ANY CERTAIN AND EVIDENT REASONS I DID NOT DOUBT BUT THAT SUCH MUST HAVE BEEN THE RULE OF THEIR INVESTIGATIONS
WHICH CAUSE THE HEART AND THE ARTERIES AGAIN TO EXPAND AS BEFORE AND BECAUSE THE BLOOD WHICH THUS ENTERS INTO THE HEART PASSES
AND THE SIX SMALL VALVES CLOSE AND THE FIVE OF THE HOLLOW
BUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE JOINED AND UNITED MORE CLOSELY TO THE BODY IN ORDER TO HAVE SENSATIONS AND APPETITES SIMILAR TO OURS AND THUS CONSTITUTE A REAL MAN
TO GIVE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS CONTAINED IN IT THE POWER TO MOVE THE MEMBERS AS WHEN WE SEE HEADS SHORTLY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK OFF STILL MOVE AND BITE THE EARTH ALTHOUGH NO LONGER ANIMATED WHAT CHANGES MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE BRAIN TO PRODUCE
WHERE IT IS DIVIDED INTO MANY BRANCHES INTERLACED WITH THOSE OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND THOSE OF THE TUBE CALLED THE WINDPIPE THROUGH WHICH THE AIR WE BREATHE ENTERS AND THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH ISSUING FROM THE HEART SENDS ITS BRANCHES ALL OVER THE BODY
AND AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR ITS ADEQUATE SOLUTION THE THIRD TO CONDUCT MY THOUGHTS IN SUCH ORDER THAT BY COMMENCING WITH OBJECTS THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW
BUT BEING GIVEN ASSUREDLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WAY IS NOT LESS OPEN TO THE MOST IGNORANT THAN TO THE MOST LEARNED AND THAT THE REVEALED TRUTHS WHICH LEAD TO HEAVEN ARE ABOVE OUR COMPREHENSION I DID NOT PRESUME TO SUBJECT THEM TO THE IMPOTENCY OF MY REASON
FOR THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTRARY TO THE ORDER PRESCRIBED IN THE METHOD
GOOD SENSE IS OF ALL THINGS AMONG MEN THE MOST EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED FOR EVERY ONE THINKS HIMSELF SO ABUNDANTLY PROVIDED WITH IT
OR CAPABLE OF BEING MORE DISTINCTLY REPRESENTED TO MY IMAGINATION AND SENSES AND ON THE OTHER HAND THAT IN ORDER TO RETAIN THEM IN THE MEMORY OR EMBRACE AN AGGREGATE OF MANY I SHOULD EXPRESS THEM BY CERTAIN CHARACTERS
FOR TO HOLD CONVERSE WITH THOSE OF OTHER AGES AND TO TRAVEL ARE ALMOST THE SAME THING IT IS USEFUL TO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE MANNERS OF DIFFERENT NATIONS THAT WE MAY BE ENABLED TO FORM A MORE CORRECT JUDGMENT REGARDING OUR OWN
THAT IT IS USEFUL TO BESTOW SOME ATTENTION UPON ALL EVEN UPON THOSE ABOUNDING THE MOST IN SUPERSTITION AND ERROR THAT WE MAY BE IN A POSITION TO DETERMINE THEIR REAL VALUE AND GUARD AGAINST BEING DECEIVED
INTO THESE THE BLOOD OF NECESSITY FLOWS FROM THE HOLLOW VEIN INTO THE RIGHT AND FROM THE VENOUS ARTERY INTO THE LEFT BECAUSE THESE TWO VESSELS ARE ALWAYS FULL OF BLOOD AND THEIR ORIFICES WHICH ARE TURNED TOWARDS THE HEART CANNOT THEN BE CLOSED
I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO REFRAIN FROM THIS EXPOSITION AND ONLY MENTION IN GENERAL WHAT THESE TRUTHS ARE THAT THE MORE JUDICIOUS MAY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MORE SPECIAL ACCOUNT OF THEM WOULD CONDUCE TO THE PUBLIC ADVANTAGE
AND AFTER THAT DID NOTHING MORE THAN LEND HIS ORDINARY CONCURRENCE TO NATURE AND ALLOW HER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED ON THIS SUPPOSITION I IN THE FIRST PLACE DESCRIBED THIS MATTER
THAT IF I DID NOT ADVANCE FAR I WOULD AT LEAST GUARD AGAINST FALLING I DID NOT EVEN CHOOSE TO DISMISS SUMMARILY ANY OF THE OPINIONS THAT HAD CREPT INTO MY BELIEF WITHOUT HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED BY REASON BUT FIRST OF ALL TOOK SUFFICIENT TIME
ARE ALWAYS THE BEST ABLE TO PERSUADE OTHERS OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT THEY LAY DOWN THOUGH THEY SHOULD SPEAK ONLY IN THE LANGUAGE OF LOWER BRITTANY AND BE WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE RULES OF RHETORIC AND THOSE WHOSE MINDS ARE STORED WITH THE MOST AGREEABLE FANCIES
ASCENDING IN GREAT ABUNDANCE FROM THE HEART TO THE BRAIN THENCE PENETRATES THROUGH THE NERVES INTO THE MUSCLES AND GIVES MOTION TO ALL THE MEMBERS SO THAT TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE BLOOD WHICH AS MOST AGITATED AND PENETRATING
AND SINCE A CERTAIN INEQUALITY OF CAPACITY IS OBSERVABLE AMONG ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS WELL AS AMONG MEN AND SINCE SOME ARE MORE CAPABLE OF BEING INSTRUCTED THAN OTHERS IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE MOST PERFECT APE OR PARROT OF ITS SPECIES
THAT MAY BE UPHELD BY LEARNED MEN WHILE THERE CAN BE BUT ONE TRUE I RECKONED AS WELL NIGH FALSE ALL THAT WAS ONLY PROBABLE AS TO THE OTHER SCIENCES
TO THE HAND WITH GREATER FORCE THAN IT DOES TO RETURN FROM THE HAND TO THE HEART THROUGH THE VEINS AND SINCE THE LATTER CURRENT ESCAPES FROM THE ARM BY THE OPENING MADE IN ONE OF THE VEINS THERE MUST OF NECESSITY
FOR TO BE POSSESSED OF A VIGOROUS MIND IS NOT ENOUGH THE PRIME REQUISITE IS RIGHTLY TO APPLY IT THE GREATEST MINDS AS THEY ARE CAPABLE OF THE HIGHEST EXCELLENCES ARE OPEN LIKEWISE TO THE GREATEST ABERRATIONS
AND IN THE FIRST WILL BE FOUND VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING THE SCIENCES IN THE SECOND THE PRINCIPAL RULES OF THE METHOD WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS DISCOVERED IN THE THIRD CERTAIN OF THE RULES OF MORALS WHICH HE HAS DEDUCED FROM THIS METHOD IN THE FOURTH
I SHOULD WISH ALSO THAT SUCH PERSONS WERE CAREFULLY SHOWN THE ELEVEN PELLICLES WHICH LIKE SO MANY SMALL VALVES OPEN AND SHUT THE FOUR ORIFICES THAT ARE IN THESE TWO CAVITIES VIZ
WHEN A BOLT OF MYRIAD LEGGED HORROR HURLED ITSELF THROUGH THE DOORWAY FULL UPON THE BREAST OF MY EXECUTIONER WITH A SHRIEK OF FEAR THE APE WHICH HELD ME LEAPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW BUT ITS MATE CLOSED IN A TERRIFIC
WITH THE CARRIAGE OF THE TRAINED FIGHTING MAN HIS FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND CLEAR CUT HIS HAIR BLACK AND CLOSELY CROPPED WHILE HIS EYES WERE OF A STEEL GRAY REFLECTING A STRONG AND LOYAL CHARACTER FILLED WITH FIRE
AS I CAME BACK TO MYSELF I GLANCED AT SOLA WHO HAD WITNESSED THIS ENCOUNTER AND I WAS SURPRISED TO NOTE A STRANGE EXPRESSION UPON HER USUALLY EXPRESSIONLESS COUNTENANCE WHAT HER THOUGHTS WERE I DID NOT KNOW FOR AS YET I HAD LEARNED BUT LITTLE OF THE MARTIAN TONGUE
SUDDENLY A LOW BUT DISTINCT MOANING SOUND ISSUED FROM THE RECESSES OF THE CAVE BEHIND ME AND AS IT REACHED THE EARS OF THE INDIANS THEY TURNED AND FLED IN TERROR PANIC STRICKEN SO FRANTIC WERE THEIR EFFORTS TO ESCAPE FROM THE UNSEEN THING BEHIND ME
WHICH FACT HAD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE NOISELESSNESS OF THEIR APPROACH AND IN COMMON WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF LEGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE FAUNA OF MARS THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN
THAN LIVE ON EARTH ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF TERRIBLE MILES FROM HER THE OLD MINE WHICH I FOUND UNTOUCHED HAS MADE ME FABULOUSLY WEALTHY BUT WHAT CARE I FOR WEALTH
I COULD SEE THEM EXAMINING THE DEAD SAILORS EVIDENTLY FOR SIGNS OF LIFE AND PRESENTLY A PARTY OF THEM APPEARED FROM BELOW DRAGGING A LITTLE FIGURE AMONG THEM THE CREATURE WAS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN HALF AS TALL AS THE GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS
PACING BACK AND FORTH WITH TENSE DRAWN FACE WHEN ALL WERE IN THEIR SEATS HE TURNED TOWARD US THIS MORNING HE SAID
OR OF REINFORCEMENTS IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT SHE WOULD STRIKE THE FACE OF THE BUILDINGS ABOUT A MILE SOUTH OF OUR POSITION AND AS I WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF THE CHASE I SAW A NUMBER OF WARRIORS GALLOP AHEAD DISMOUNT AND ENTER THE BUILDING SHE SEEMED DESTINED TO TOUCH
OWING TO THE FEAR OF A RETURN ATTACK BY THE AIR CRAFT LORQUAS PTOMEL WAS TOO ASTUTE AN OLD WARRIOR TO BE CAUGHT UPON THE OPEN PLAINS WITH A CARAVAN OF CHARIOTS AND CHILDREN AND SO WE REMAINED AT THE DESERTED CITY UNTIL THE DANGER SEEMED PASSED
HAD THEIR MISSIONS BEEN PEACEFUL OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE EXCHANGED SHOTS OR HAVE FOUGHT OUT THEIR INTRODUCTION WITH SOME OTHER OF THEIR VARIOUS WEAPONS MY CAPTOR WHOSE NAME WAS TARS TARKAS
FOR TO BE CAUGHT ON THE OPEN PLAINS WITH A CAVALCADE OF CHARIOTS AND CHILDREN WAS FAR FROM THE DESIRE OF EVEN SO WARLIKE A PEOPLE AS THE GREEN MARTIANS DURING OUR PERIOD OF INACTIVITY
BREAKING AWAY FROM A CLINCH IT WAS THE ONE LITTLE OPENING THAT DAK KOVA NEEDED AND HURLING HIMSELF AT THE BODY OF HIS ADVERSARY
WHO REPRESENTED TO ME ALL THAT I HAD LEFT BEHIND UPON EARTH IN AGREEABLE AND CONGENIAL COMPANIONSHIP THERE SEEMED BONDS OF MUTUAL INTEREST BETWEEN US AS POWERFUL AS
WHEN I HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR CUSTOMS I LEARNED THAT I HAD WON WHAT THEY SELDOM ACCORD A MANIFESTATION OF APPROBATION THE FELLOW WHOM I HAD STRUCK LAY WHERE HE HAD FALLEN
LONGER THAN THE ACT OF ADJUSTING THE SILK REQUIRED SHE DID NOT DRAW AWAY NOR DID SHE SPEAK AND SO IN SILENCE WE WALKED THE SURFACE OF A DYING WORLD BUT IN THE BREAST OF ONE OF US AT LEAST HAD BEEN BORN THAT
AND THE GROTESQUE CARICATURES WHICH SAT BLINKING IN THE SUNLIGHT WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE ME TO DOUBT MY SANITY THEY SEEMED MOSTLY HEAD WITH LITTLE SCRAWNY BODIES LONG NECKS AND SIX LEGS OR
AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES
STRENGTH AND COURAGE SOLA WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED THE SEARCHING PARTY OF HER OWN VOLITION WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE MARTIANS WHOSE FACE HAD NOT BEEN TWISTED IN LAUGHTER AS I BATTLED FOR MY LIFE SHE ON THE CONTRARY
HOW CAN EARTHLY WORDS DESCRIBE IT IT TOWERED TEN FEET AT THE SHOULDER HAD FOUR LEGS ON EITHER SIDE A BROAD FLAT TAIL LARGER AT THE TIP THAN AT THE ROOT AND WHICH IT HELD
HE WAS A HUGE FELLOW TERRIBLY SCARRED ABOUT THE FACE AND CHEST AND WITH ONE BROKEN TUSK AND A MISSING EAR
IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UPON EARTH AND FROM DESIRING TO ANNIHILATE ME THEY SUDDENLY LOOKED UPON ME AS A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY TO BE CAPTURED AND EXHIBITED AMONG THEIR FELLOWS THE RESPITE
AND ONE HAND I UNLOOSENED ONE OF THE LONG LEATHER STRAPS OF MY TRAPPINGS AT THE END OF WHICH DANGLED A GREAT HOOK BY WHICH AIR SAILORS ARE HUNG TO THE SIDES AND BOTTOMS OF THEIR CRAFT FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES OF REPAIR
OR DID HER BEAUTIFUL BODY LIE COLD IN DEATH BESIDE THE TINY GOLDEN INCUBATOR IN THE SUNKEN GARDEN
WILD LIFE IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD WE ALL LOVED HIM AND OUR SLAVES FAIRLY WORSHIPPED THE GROUND HE TROD HE WAS A SPLENDID SPECIMEN OF MANHOOD STANDING A GOOD TWO INCHES OVER SIX FEET BROAD OF SHOULDER AND NARROW OF HIP
THOUGH UPON SOME OTHER BEAST IF NOT HIS TORN AND MANGLED BODY WAS GATHERED UP BY HIS WOMEN AND BURNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THARKIAN CUSTOM
I REASONED WITH MYSELF THAT I HAD LAIN HELPLESS FOR MANY HOURS WITHIN THE CAVE
ABOUT THIS ASSEMBLAGE AND THE HALL IN WHICH THEY WERE CONGREGATED WAS THE FACT THAT THE CREATURES WERE ENTIRELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE DESKS CHAIRS AND OTHER FURNISHINGS THESE BEING OF A SIZE ADAPTED TO HUMAN BEINGS SUCH AS I
NO LONGER WAS I A JIBBERING IDIOT BUT A SANE REASONING MAN WITH THE MEANS OF ESCAPE WITHIN MY VERY HANDS AS I WAS GROPING TO REMOVE THE CHAIN FROM ABOUT MY VICTIM'S NECK
HE SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR STONE DEAD LAUGHING AND CHATTERING LIKE THE IDIOT I WAS FAST BECOMING
SOME WERE SURVEYING ME WITH EXPRESSIONS WHICH I AFTERWARD DISCOVERED MARKED EXTREME ASTONISHMENT AND THE OTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY SATISFYING THEMSELVES THAT I HAD NOT MOLESTED THEIR YOUNG
BUT I CAN SAY WITHOUT SHAME THAT IF THE SENSATIONS I ENDURED DURING THE NEXT FEW MINUTES WERE FEAR THEN MAY GOD HELP THE COWARD FOR COWARDICE IS OF A SURETY ITS OWN PUNISHMENT TO BE HELD PARALYZED
WITHOUT FALLING I THEN RETURNED BY EASY JUMPS OF TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY FEET TO THE LITTLE GROUP OF WARRIORS MY EXHIBITION HAD BEEN WITNESSED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED LESSER MARTIANS AND THEY IMMEDIATELY BROKE INTO DEMANDS FOR A REPETITION
HE STOOPED AND KISSED THE WOMEN OF HIS FAMILY AND LAID HIS STRONG HAND UPON THE SHOULDERS OF THE MEN AS I TURNED SADLY FROM HIM MY EYES FELL UPON DEJAH THORIS HER HEAD WAS DROOPING UPON HER BREAST TO ALL APPEARANCES SHE WAS LIFELESS
BEFORE THE PLEA WERE MADE SHE REPLIED RISING AND PLACING HER DEAR HANDS UPON MY SHOULDERS AND SO I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER AND THUS IN THE MIDST OF A CITY OF WILD CONFLICT FILLED WITH THE ALARMS OF WAR
I RETURNED I HAVE DONE MANY STRANGE THINGS IN MY LIFE MANY THINGS THAT WISER MEN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST FANCIES HAVE I DREAMED OF WINNING A DEJAH THORIS FOR MYSELF
I HAVE BROUGHT A STRANGE CREATURE WEARING THE METAL OF A THARK WHOM IT IS MY PLEASURE TO HAVE BATTLE WITH A WILD THOAT AT THE GREAT GAMES HE WILL DIE AS BAR COMAS YOUR JEDDAK SEES FIT IF AT ALL
AS I NEARED THE BUILDING I BECAME MORE CAREFUL AS I JUDGED AND RIGHTLY THAT THE PLACE WOULD BE GUARDED SEVERAL MEN IN CIVILIAN METAL LOITERED NEAR THE FRONT ENTRANCE AND IN THE REAR WERE OTHERS MY ONLY MEANS OF REACHING
HIS GREAT EYES FASTENED UPON ME IN WHAT SEEMED A PITIFUL APPEAL FOR PROTECTION I COULD NOT WITHSTAND THAT LOOK NOR COULD I ON SECOND THOUGHT HAVE DESERTED MY RESCUER WITHOUT GIVING AS GOOD AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF IN HIS BEHALF
WHICH HE PREVIOUSLY HAD HAD CONSTRUCTED AND WHICH AS I LATER LEARNED
HE ENTIRELY OMITTED THE USUAL FORMAL SALUTATION AS WE ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THE JEDDAK AND AS HE PUSHED ME ROUGHLY BEFORE THE RULER HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD AND MENACING VOICE
SUCH AS CONTACT WITH NO OTHER MORTAL HAD EVEN PRODUCED AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE HAD LEANED SLIGHTLY TOWARD ME BUT OF THAT I WAS NOT SURE ONLY I KNEW THAT AS MY ARM RESTED THERE ACROSS HER SHOULDERS
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN FROM JOY TO DEATH FOR TEN DAYS THE HORDES OF THARK AND THEIR WILD ALLIES WERE FEASTED AND ENTERTAINED AND THEN LOADED WITH COSTLY PRESENTS
UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION I SAW AS WE PASSED THEM THAT THE BUILDINGS WERE DESERTED AND WHILE NOT GREATLY DECAYED HAD THE APPEARANCE OF NOT HAVING BEEN TENANTED FOR YEARS POSSIBLY FOR AGES
THEIR BULLETS EXPLODE WHEN THEY STRIKE AN OBJECT WELL THE OPAQUE OUTER COATING IS BROKEN BY THE IMPACT EXPOSING A GLASS CYLINDER ALMOST SOLID IN THE FORWARD END OF WHICH IS A MINUTE PARTICLE OF RADIUM POWDER
AS NO TWO OF US ARE IDENTICAL ALTHOUGH WE ARE ALL CAST IN A SIMILAR MOLD THIS PICTURE OR RATHER MATERIALIZED NIGHTMARE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AT LENGTH
ITS BELLY WAS WHITE AND ITS LEGS SHADED FROM THE SLATE OF ITS SHOULDERS AND HIPS TO A VIVID YELLOW AT THE FEET THE FEET THEMSELVES WERE HEAVILY PADDED AND NAILLESS
BUT AS HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE DEJAH THORIS SPRANG BEFORE HIM AND THEN MY SWORD FOUND THE SPOT THAT MADE SAB THAN JEDDAK OF ZODANGA
SO WHY NOT THEN ON MARS PLACING MY HAND OVER MY HEART I BOWED LOW TO THE MARTIAN AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHILE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE
THE LAST WARRIOR TO LEAVE THE DECK TURNED AND THREW SOMETHING BACK UPON THE VESSEL WAITING AN INSTANT TO NOTE THE OUTCOME OF HIS ACT AS A FAINT SPURT OF FLAME ROSE FROM THE POINT WHERE THE MISSILE STRUCK HE SWUNG OVER THE SIDE AND WAS QUICKLY UPON THE GROUND
FOR THE EFFORT WHICH ON EARTH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME STANDING UPRIGHT CARRIED ME INTO THE MARTIAN AIR TO THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT THREE YARDS I ALIGHTED SOFTLY UPON THE GROUND HOWEVER WITHOUT APPRECIABLE SHOCK OR JAR
I WAS NOT ASLEEP NO NEED FOR PINCHING HERE MY INNER CONSCIOUSNESS TOLD ME AS PLAINLY THAT I WAS UPON MARS AS YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE UPON EARTH YOU DO NOT QUESTION THE FACT
THE NEXT TWO DAYS BROUGHT NO NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN THE SUPPLY OF AIR
UPON THE UPPER WORKS AND UPON THE STEERING GEAR AND PROPELLERS TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST VOLLEY THE GREAT FLEET SWUNG TRAILING OFF IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT HAD FIRST APPEARED SEVERAL OF THE CRAFT WERE LIMPING PERCEPTIBLY
HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
WHERE I MOMENTARILY EXPECTED THE FORMER TO FALL LIMP AT THE END OF A BROKEN NECK IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS THE APE WAS TEARING AWAY THE ENTIRE FRONT OF ITS BREAST WHICH WAS HELD IN THE VISE LIKE GRIP OF THE POWERFUL JAWS
AND CAME AROUND THE END OF THE INCUBATOR TOWARD ME ENTIRELY UNARMED AND AS NAKED AS I EXCEPT FOR THE ORNAMENTS STRAPPED UPON HIS HEAD LIMBS AND BREAST
AND WITH MY LONG SWORD POINTED TO THE FAR END OF THE HALL ZODANGA HAS FALLEN I CRIED LOOK ALL EYES TURNED IN THE DIRECTION I HAD INDICATED AND THERE FORGING THROUGH THE PORTALS OF THE ENTRANCEWAY
WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
AND I DOUBT THAT WERE ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY TO BE TRANSPORTED TO EARTH HE COULD LIFT HIS OWN WEIGHT FROM THE GROUND IN FACT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO MY FEAT THEN WAS AS MARVELOUS UPON MARS
WITH ONE'S BACK TOWARD SOME HORRIBLE AND UNKNOWN DANGER FROM THE VERY SOUND OF WHICH THE FEROCIOUS APACHE WARRIORS TURN IN WILD STAMPEDE AS A FLOCK OF SHEEP WOULD MADLY FLEE FROM A PACK OF WOLVES SEEMS TO ME THE LAST WORD IN FEARSOME PREDICAMENTS
THAT ONE OF THE BRAVES WAS HURLED HEADLONG FROM THE CLIFF TO THE ROCKS BELOW THEIR WILD CRIES ECHOED IN THE CANYON FOR A SHORT TIME AND THEN ALL WAS STILL ONCE MORE THE SOUND WHICH HAD FRIGHTENED THEM WAS NOT REPEATED
AND TONIGHT SHE SEEMS CALLING TO ME AGAIN AS SHE HAS NOT CALLED BEFORE SINCE THAT LONG DEAD NIGHT AND I THINK I CAN SEE ACROSS THAT AWFUL ABYSS OF SPACE A BEAUTIFUL BLACK HAIRED WOMAN STANDING IN THE GARDEN OF A PALACE AND AT HER SIDE IS A LITTLE BOY WHO PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HER
THE WHITENESS OF THE TEETH IS NOT THAT OF IVORY BUT OF THE SNOWIEST AND MOST GLEAMING OF CHINA AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF THEIR OLIVE SKINS THEIR TUSKS STAND OUT IN A MOST STRIKING MANNER
RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
SHE WAS OF A LIGHT OLIVE GREEN COLOR WITH A SMOOTH GLOSSY HIDE HER NAME AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS SOLA AND SHE BELONGED TO THE RETINUE OF TARS TARKAS SHE CONDUCTED ME TO A SPACIOUS CHAMBER
THEY SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN ARGUMENT AND FINALLY ONE OF THEM ADDRESSED ME BUT REMEMBERING MY IGNORANCE OF HIS LANGUAGE TURNED BACK TO TARS TARKAS WHO WITH A WORD AND GESTURE GAVE SOME COMMAND TO THE FELLOW
BLOWING A HOLE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WOOD AND MASONRY I THEN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE FEARSOME LOOKING THING AND RAISING IT TO ITS FEET MOTIONED FOR IT TO FOLLOW ME
NINE LONG FORGOTTEN SOUNDS LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN THE DARKNESS THEIR FULL PURPORT DAWNED UPON ME
MY EFFORT WAS CROWNED WITH A SUCCESS WHICH APPALLED ME NO LESS THAN IT SEEMED TO SURPRISE THE MARTIAN WARRIORS FOR IT CARRIED ME FULLY THIRTY FEET INTO THE AIR AND LANDED ME A HUNDRED FEET
OF INCITANTS TO MERRIMENT THE DEATH AGONIES OF A FELLOW BEING ARE TO THESE STRANGE CREATURES PROVOCATIVE OF THE WILDEST HILARITY WHILE THEIR CHIEF FORM OF COMMONEST AMUSEMENT
MY EXPERIENCE WITH WOOLA DETERMINED ME TO ATTEMPT THE EXPERIMENT OF KINDNESS IN MY TREATMENT OF MY THOATS FIRST I TAUGHT THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT UNSEAT ME AND EVEN RAPPED THEM SHARPLY BETWEEN THE EARS TO IMPRESS UPON THEM MY AUTHORITY AND MASTERY
I WAS STANDING NEAR THE WINDOW AND I KNEW THAT ONCE IN THE STREET I MIGHT GAIN THE PLAZA AND SAFETY BEFORE THE CREATURE COULD OVERTAKE ME AT LEAST THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
AND SAVAGE EYES LOOKED INTO MINE THAT HE COULD SEE ME IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE CAVE I WAS SURE FOR THE EARLY MORNING SUN WAS FALLING FULL UPON ME THROUGH THE OPENING THE FELLOW INSTEAD OF APPROACHING MERELY STOOD AND STARED
THE BUILDING WAS AN ENORMOUS ONE REARING ITS LOFTY HEAD FULLY A THOUSAND FEET INTO THE AIR BUT FEW BUILDINGS IN ZODANGA WERE HIGHER THAN THESE BARRACKS THOUGH SEVERAL TOPPED IT BY A FEW HUNDRED FEET
WHEN THE DELICATE SHELL SHOULD BREAK VIVID IN MY MEMORY IS THE PICTURE OF THE LAST NIGHT AS WE SAT THERE TALKING IN LOW TONES OF THE STRANGE ROMANCE WHICH HAD WOVEN OUR LIVES TOGETHER AND OF THIS WONDER WHICH WAS COMING TO AUGMENT OUR HAPPINESS
EVIL LOOKING PISTOL FROM ITS HOLSTER AND WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CREATURE WHEN I SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK UP HIS ARM THE BULLET STRIKING THE WOODEN CASING OF THE WINDOW EXPLODED
THAT I NOTICED A SLIGHT VAPOR FILLING THE CAVE IT WAS EXTREMELY TENUOUS AND ONLY NOTICEABLE AGAINST THE OPENING WHICH LED TO DAYLIGHT THERE ALSO CAME TO MY NOSTRILS A FAINTLY PUNGENT ODOR AND I COULD ONLY ASSUME THAT I HAD BEEN OVERCOME BY SOME POISONOUS GAS
KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD AND WITH THE HEAVY HILT I SHATTERED THE GLASS OF THE GREAT WINDOW AND SPRANG INTO THE MIDST OF THE ASTONISHED ASSEMBLAGE
AS THE MUSCULAR EXERTION WHICH CARRIED ME EASILY AND SAFELY UPON EARTH PLAYED STRANGE ANTICS WITH ME UPON MARS INSTEAD OF PROGRESSING IN A SANE AND DIGNIFIED MANNER
AND FROM MY BALCONY I COULD SEE THAT IT WALKED ERECT UPON TWO LEGS AND SURMISED THAT IT WAS SOME NEW AND STRANGE MARTIAN MONSTROSITY WITH WHICH I HAD NOT AS YET BECOME ACQUAINTED THEY REMOVED THEIR PRISONER TO THE GROUND
WHILE THE BANNERS AND UPPER WORKS DISSOLVED IN SPURTS OF FLAME AS THE IRRESISTIBLE PROJECTILES OF OUR WARRIORS MOWED THROUGH THEM THE FIRE FROM THE VESSELS WAS MOST INEFFECTUAL OWING AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED
AS MY TOUR OF DUTY MUST HAVE ENDED SOME TIME SINCE I SAW THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AT THE PALACE AND WHEN I HAD ENLIGHTENED HIM HE WAS ALL EXCITEMENT THE NEWS THAT DEJAH THORIS HAD PROMISED HER HAND TO SAB THAN
RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
EACH CARRIED A STRANGE BANNER SWUNG FROM STEM TO STERN ABOVE THE UPPER WORKS AND UPON THE PROW OF EACH WAS PAINTED SOME ODD DEVICE THAT GLEAMED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND SHOWED PLAINLY EVEN AT THE DISTANCE AT WHICH WE WERE FROM THE VESSELS
THE DARK AND ANCIENT ISS WHICH CARRIES US TO AN UNKNOWN BUT AT LEAST NO MORE FRIGHTFUL AND TERRIBLE EXISTENCE FORTUNATE INDEED IS HE WHO MEETS HIS END IN AN EARLY DEATH SAY WHAT YOU PLEASE TO TARS TARKAS
HE SPENT AT MY FATHER'S HOME IN VIRGINIA JUST PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE CIVIL WAR I WAS THEN A CHILD OF BUT FIVE YEARS
OF THE LITTLE DEVILS I HAD BEEN WATCHING BUT HOW PUNY AND HARMLESS THEY NOW LOOKED BESIDE THIS HUGE AND TERRIFIC INCARNATION OF HATE OF VENGEANCE AND OF DEATH
FOR EXAMPLE A PROPORTION OF THEM ALWAYS THE BEST MARKSMEN DIRECT THEIR FIRE ENTIRELY UPON THE WIRELESS FINDING AND SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE BIG GUNS OF AN ATTACKING NAVAL FORCE ANOTHER DETAIL ATTENDS TO THE SMALLER GUNS IN THE SAME WAY
NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
TELLING ME I WOULD FIND HIS WILL THERE AND SOME PERSONAL INSTRUCTIONS WHICH HE HAD ME PLEDGE MYSELF TO CARRY OUT WITH ABSOLUTE FIDELITY AFTER I HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT
HE CAN METE OUT NO WORSE FATE TO ME THAN A CONTINUATION OF THE HORRIBLE EXISTENCE WE ARE FORCED TO LEAD IN THIS LIFE THIS WILD OUTBREAK ON THE PART OF SOLA SO GREATLY SURPRISED AND SHOCKED THE OTHER WOMEN THAT AFTER A FEW WORDS OF GENERAL REPRIMAND
WHEN I SAW TARS TARKAS SURGING THROUGH THE CROWD OF PYGMIES THAT SWARMED ABOUT HIM WITH ONE SWING OF HIS MIGHTY LONGSWORD HE LAID A DOZEN CORPSES AT HIS FEET
WITH DRAWN LONG SWORD IN AN INSTANT WE WERE ENGAGED AND I FOUND NO MEAN ANTAGONIST AS WE CIRCLED UPON THE BROAD PLATFORM I SAW SAB THAN RUSHING UP THE STEPS TO AID HIS FATHER
THE PEOPLE SEEMED NEVER TO TIRE OF HEAPING HONORS UPON ME AND NO DAY PASSED THAT DID NOT BRING SOME NEW PROOF OF THEIR LOVE FOR MY PRINCESS THE INCOMPARABLE DEJAH THORIS
AND AS MY HORSE HAD WANDERED OFF I WAS LEFT WITHOUT MEANS OF DEFENSE MY ONLY ALTERNATIVE SEEMED TO LIE IN FLIGHT
THE STRANGE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS UPON HOG BACK AND ARROYO AND THE GROTESQUE DETAILS OF THE STIFF YET BEAUTIFUL CACTI FORM A PICTURE AT ONCE ENCHANTING AND INSPIRING AS THOUGH ONE WERE CATCHING FOR THE FIRST TIME A GLIMPSE OF SOME DEAD AND FORGOTTEN WORLD
A SIGN WHICH I DID NOT OF COURSE UNDERSTAND JUST A MOMENT WE GAZED UPON EACH OTHER AND THEN THE LOOK OF HOPE AND RENEWED COURAGE WHICH HAD GLORIFIED HER FACE AS SHE DISCOVERED ME FADED INTO ONE OF UTTER DEJECTION MINGLED WITH LOATHING AND CONTEMPT
BAR COMAS WAS STONE DEAD AND ONLY THE MOST HERCULEAN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF DAK KOVA'S FEMALES SAVED HIM FROM THE FATE HE DESERVED THREE DAYS LATER HE WALKED WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO THE BODY OF BAR COMAS WHICH
I KNOW THAT BARSOOM HAS NEVER BEFORE SEEN YOUR LIKE CAN IT BE THAT ALL EARTH MEN ARE AS YOU ALONE A STRANGER HUNTED THREATENED PERSECUTED
I SEIZED THE CUDGEL WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE BATTLE AND SWINGING IT WITH ALL THE POWER OF MY EARTHLY ARMS I CRASHED IT FULL UPON THE HEAD OF THE APE CRUSHING HIS SKULL AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN EGGSHELL
NOW IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THEM HOW THEY SHOULD DIE LET US GO ABOUT OUR DUTIES AS THOUGH A THOUSAND USEFUL YEARS STILL LAY BEFORE US THE CHAMBER RANG WITH APPLAUSE
AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
THAN ORDERS WERE GIVEN FOR AN IMMEDIATE AND HASTY RETURN AS THOUGH TRAINED FOR YEARS IN THIS PARTICULAR EVOLUTION THE GREEN MARTIANS MELTED LIKE MIST INTO THE SPACIOUS DOORWAYS OF THE NEARBY BUILDINGS UNTIL IN LESS THAN THREE MINUTES
WHICH WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE ON EARTH THE THEORETIC EFFECTIVE RADIUS OF THIS RIFLE IS THREE HUNDRED MILES BUT THE BEST THEY CAN DO IN ACTUAL SERVICE
BUT THE TRUTH SLOWLY FORCED ITSELF UPON ME I WAS LOOKING UPON ARIZONA FROM THE SAME LEDGE FROM WHICH TEN YEARS BEFORE I HAD GAZED WITH LONGING UPON MARS BURYING MY HEAD IN MY ARMS I TURNED
AS I TOUCHED THE CORD THE SKELETONS SWUNG TO THE MOTION WITH A NOISE AS OF THE RUSTLING OF DRY LEAVES IT WAS A MOST GROTESQUE AND HORRID TABLEAU AND I HASTENED OUT INTO THE FRESH AIR GLAD TO ESCAPE FROM SO GRUESOME A PLACE
SHE KNOWS IT KANTOS KAN AND REPULSES ME ONLY BECAUSE SHE IS PROMISED TO SAB THAN THE SPLENDID FELLOW SPRANG TO HIS FEET
ALTHOUGH I AT FIRST BOMBARDED HIM WITH QUESTIONS FINALLY ALL THE HATRED AND MANIACAL LOATHING FOR THESE AWFUL CREATURES WHO HAD PLACED ME IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE WAS CENTERED BY MY TOTTERING REASON UPON THIS SINGLE EMISSARY
FAR BELOW ME LAY THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED STREETS THE HARD PAVEMENTS AND DEATH THERE WAS A LITTLE JERK AT THE TOP OF THE SUPPORTING EAVES
ALL BARSOOM I HAD TO FLY LOW TO GET SUFFICIENT AIR TO BREATHE BUT I TOOK A STRAIGHT COURSE ACROSS AN OLD SEA BOTTOM AND SO HAD TO RISE ONLY A FEW FEET ABOVE THE GROUND I TRAVELED WITH AWFUL VELOCITY FOR MY ERRAND WAS A RACE AGAINST TIME WITH DEATH
FOOD WAS BROUGHT ME AT INTERVALS BUT OWING TO THE UTTER DARKNESS OF THE PLACE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I LAY THERE DAYS OR WEEKS OR MONTHS IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF ALL MY LIFE
SO DIFFERENT IS IT FROM THE ASPECT OF ANY OTHER SPOT UPON OUR EARTH AS I STOOD THUS MEDITATING I TURNED MY GAZE FROM THE LANDSCAPE TO THE HEAVENS WHERE THE MYRIAD STARS FORMED A GORGEOUS AND FITTING CANOPY FOR THE WONDERS OF THE EARTHLY SCENE
SCARCELY HAD THE BLOW DESCENDED WHEN I WAS CONFRONTED WITH A NEW DANGER THE APE'S MATE RECOVERED FROM ITS FIRST SHOCK OF TERROR HAD RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF THE ENCOUNTER BY WAY OF THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING
I DOVE DOWN INTO THE STREETS OF THE CITY FAR BELOW THE PLANE USUALLY OCCUPIED BY THE AIR PATROL IN LESS THAN A MINUTE I WAS SETTLING SAFELY UPON THE ROOF OF OUR APARTMENT BESIDE THE ASTONISHED KANTOS KAN
AND HAD THE CHOICE BEEN LEFT TO ME I COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A MORE FITTING MATE FOR THE FIRST PRINCESS OF BARSOOM HERE IS MY HAND UPON YOUR SHOULDER JOHN CARTER AND MY WORD
I FELT IT SAFER TO AFFECT INDIFFERENCE IN THE MATTER UNTIL I LEARNED MORE SURELY SOLA'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE OBJECT OF MY SOLICITUDE SARKOJA
AND THERE CAME AGAIN FROM THE BLACK SHADOWS THE SOUND OF A MOVING THING AND A FAINT RUSTLING AS OF DEAD LEAVES THE SHOCK TO MY ALREADY OVERSTRAINED NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE IN THE EXTREME AND WITH A SUPERHUMAN EFFORT I STROVE TO BREAK MY AWFUL BONDS
CONDITIONS SEEMED MUCH WORSE HERE THAN AT HELIUM AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I BREATHED AT ALL THERE WERE A FEW MEN STILL CONSCIOUS AND TO ONE OF THESE I SPOKE IF I CAN OPEN THESE DOORS IS THERE A MAN WHO CAN START THE ENGINES I ASKED I CAN
NEITHER DID I I FOUND MYSELF LYING PRONE UPON A BED OF YELLOWISH MOSSLIKE VEGETATION WHICH STRETCHED AROUND ME IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR INTERMINABLE MILES I SEEMED TO BE LYING IN A DEEP
YOU HAVE DONE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS WHAT IN ALL THE PAST AGES OF BARSOOM NO MAN HAS EVER DONE JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS
MY ATTENTION WAS QUICKLY RIVETED BY A LARGE RED STAR CLOSE TO THE DISTANT HORIZON AS I GAZED UPON IT I FELT A SPELL OF OVERPOWERING FASCINATION IT WAS MARS THE GOD OF WAR
WHICH SEEMED TO MARK ALL THE GREATER WARRIORS AMONG THE WARHOONS AS WELL AS TO INDICATE THEIR AWFUL FEROCITY WHICH GREATLY TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT OF THE THARKS THE JEDDAK BAR COMAS WHO WAS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG
LEFT ALONE IN THE STUDY I OPENED THE SAFE AND WITHDREW THE CONTENTS OF THE DRAWER IN WHICH HE HAD TOLD ME I WOULD FIND MY INSTRUCTIONS THEY WERE IN PART PECULIAR INDEED
THE MOMENT THE SUNLIGHT EVEN THOUGH DIFFUSED STRIKES THIS POWDER IT EXPLODES WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH NOTHING CAN WITHSTAND IF YOU EVER WITNESS A NIGHT BATTLE YOU WILL NOTE THE ABSENCE OF THESE EXPLOSIONS
THAN KOSIS NOW TOOK A SET OF THE ORNAMENTS FROM ONE OF THE SALVERS
KILL HER KILL HER CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES
THEY WERE CONVERSING TOGETHER IN LOW TONES AND GESTICULATING AND POINTING TOWARD ME THEIR DISCOVERY THAT I HAD NOT HARMED THE LITTLE MARTIANS AND THAT I WAS UNARMED MUST HAVE CAUSED THEM
IT WAS AN EFFORT OF THE MIND OF THE WILL OF THE NERVES NOT MUSCULAR FOR I COULD NOT MOVE EVEN SO MUCH AS MY LITTLE FINGER BUT NONE THE LESS MIGHTY FOR ALL THAT AND THEN SOMETHING GAVE THERE WAS A MOMENTARY FEELING OF NAUSEA
STILLED THEIR CLAMOR AND WE PROCEEDED AT A TROT ACROSS THE PLAZA TO THE ENTRANCE OF AS MAGNIFICENT AN EDIFICE AS MORTAL EYE HAS RESTED UPON THE BUILDING WAS LOW BUT COVERED AN ENORMOUS AREA
FACING MY UNKNOWN FOE AND THEN THE MOONLIGHT FLOODED THE CAVE
WITH A BOUND I WAS ON THE STEPS OF THE PLATFORM BESIDE THAN KOSIS AND AS HE STOOD RIVETED WITH SURPRISE I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER
AND A QUANTITY OF SOLID FOODS AND LIQUIDS INCLUDING MANY CASKS OF WATER THE FIRST I HAD SEEN SINCE MY ADVENT UPON MARS
FOREVER WARRING AMONG OUR OWN KIND AS WELL AS UPON THE RED MEN AND EVEN IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES THE INDIVIDUALS FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES OH IT IS ONE CONTINUAL AWFUL PERIOD OF BLOODSHED FROM THE TIME WE BREAK THE SHELL UNTIL WE GLADLY EMBRACE THE BOSOM OF THE RIVER OF MYSTERY
I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER
TO FORM A HUGE CANOPY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE HALL THERE WAS NO STAIRWAY BUT A GENTLE INCLINE TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING OPENED INTO AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER ENCIRCLED BY GALLERIES ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER
THE NOISE OF THE APPROACHING HORSES HAD CEASED AND I JUDGED THE INDIANS WERE CREEPING STEALTHILY UPON ME ALONG THE LITTLE LEDGE WHICH LED TO MY LIVING TOMB I REMEMBER THAT I HOPED THEY WOULD MAKE SHORT WORK OF ME
I ASKED THERE IS USUALLY BUT ONE MAN ON DUTY THERE AT NIGHT UPON THE ROOF GO TO THE ROOF OF THIS BUILDING KANTOS KAN AND WAIT ME THERE
MY ABSENCE HAD BEEN NOTED BY SOLA ON HER AWAKENING AND SHE HAD QUICKLY INFORMED TARS TARKAS WHO HAD SET OUT IMMEDIATELY WITH A HANDFUL OF WARRIORS TO SEARCH FOR ME AS THEY HAD APPROACHED THE LIMITS OF THE CITY
WHICH THROUGH ALL ETERNITY MUST GO SWINGING THROUGH THE HEAVENS PEOPLED NOT EVEN BY MEMORIES IT IS THE END
ON THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE PRISONER'S VISIT TO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THE CONVERSATION FINALLY FELL UPON THIS SUBJECT AND I WAS ALL EARS ON THE INSTANT I HAD FEARED TO QUESTION SOLA RELATIVE TO THE BEAUTIFUL CAPTIVE
WHEN HE CAME UPON IT IT LAY HE SAID STRETCHED FULL LENGTH IN THE SNOW WITH THE ARMS OUTSTRETCHED ABOVE THE HEAD TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE BLUFF AND WHEN HE SHOWED ME THE SPOT IT FLASHED UPON ME THAT IT WAS THE IDENTICAL ONE
AND A VOICE ROARED OUT A COMMAND TO HALT FOLLOWING WITH A SHOT AS I PAID NO ATTENTION TO HIS HAIL KANTOS KAN DROPPED QUICKLY INTO THE DARKNESS WHILE I ROSE STEADILY
FOR NEVER HAD I DREAMED THAT IN ALL THE UNIVERSE DWELT SUCH A WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM THAT YOU ARE A PRINCESS DOES NOT ABASH ME BUT THAT YOU ARE YOU
BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
AND HASTEN THE ASSISTANT KEEPER TO THE PLANT ALL DAY A THOUSAND CRUISERS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR HIM UNTIL JUST NOW ONE OF THEM RETURNS BEARING HIS DEAD BODY WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE PITS BENEATH HIS HOUSE HORRIBLY MUTILATED BY SOME ASSASSIN
AND BY MEANS OF WHICH LANDING PARTIES ARE LOWERED TO THE GROUND FROM THE BATTLESHIPS I SWUNG THIS HOOK CAUTIOUSLY
LOOKING UP INTO THE HEAVENS AT WHAT I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I READ HIS MANUSCRIPT YEARS AFTERWARD HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD BEEN PROSPECTING AND MINING IN ARIZONA PART OF THE TIME SINCE THE WAR
SO AT HIS SUGGESTION I RETURNED TO SEARCH THE BODIES ON THE FLOOR ABOVE FOR KEYS TO OPEN THE PADLOCKS OF HIS CELL AND OF HIS CHAINS FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER
WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
AS WELL AS IN THE TRAINING OF MY THOATS THE FEW TIMES I HAD VISITED HER QUARTERS SHE HAD BEEN ABSENT WALKING UPON THE STREETS WITH SOLA OR INVESTIGATING THE BUILDINGS IN THE NEAR VICINITY OF THE PLAZA
BY KINDNESS I REPLIED YOU SEE TARS TARKAS THE SOFTER SENTIMENTS HAVE THEIR VALUE EVEN TO A WARRIOR IN THE HEIGHT OF BATTLE AS WELL AS UPON THE MARCH I KNOW THAT MY THOATS WILL OBEY MY EVERY COMMAND
WITH DIRE FOREBODINGS I AM EVER WILLING TO STAND AND FIGHT WHEN THE ODDS ARE NOT TOO OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST ME BUT IN THIS INSTANCE I PERCEIVED NEITHER GLORY NOR PROFIT
WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED
RETURNED UPON A BATTLESHIP THAT HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO THARK TO FETCH THEM IN TIME FOR THE CEREMONY WHICH MADE DEJAH
THE CONCUSSION NEARLY CAPSIZED HER AND WITH A SICKENING PLUNGE SHE HURTLED DOWNWARD THROUGH THE DARK NIGHT
HIS ACTIONS SPOKE FOR THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WERE MOST DEAR TO MY HEART OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BABBLING BROOK FOR ALL THE INTELLIGENCE MY SPEECH CARRIED TO HIM
I KNEW THAT SHE WAS FOND OF ME AND NOW THAT I HAD DISCOVERED THAT SHE HATED CRUELTY AND BARBARITY I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I COULD DEPEND UPON HER TO AID ME AND THE GIRL CAPTIVE TO ESCAPE PROVIDED OF COURSE THAT SUCH A THING WAS WITHIN THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES
BUT AS HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE DEJAH THORIS SPRANG BEFORE HIM AND THEN MY SWORD FOUND THE SPOT THAT MADE SAB THAN JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS HIS FATHER ROLLED DEAD UPON THE FLOOR
I WAS EVER A GOOD HAND WITH ANIMALS AND BY INCLINATION AS WELL AS BECAUSE IT BROUGHT MORE LASTING AND SATISFACTORY RESULTS I WAS ALWAYS KIND AND HUMANE IN MY DEALINGS WITH THE LOWER ORDERS
THEY HAVE NO LAWYERS I DID NOT SEE THE PRISONER AGAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS SUBSEQUENT TO OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER AND THEN ONLY TO CATCH A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF HER AS SHE WAS BEING CONDUCTED TO THE GREAT AUDIENCE CHAMBER WHERE I HAD HAD MY FIRST MEETING WITH LORQUAS PTOMEL
AND WITH A LAST POWERFUL EFFORT RIPPED THE YOUNG JEDDAK WIDE OPEN THE FULL LENGTH OF HIS BODY THE GREAT TUSK
I WAS STRAPPED SECURELY TO AS WILD AND UNMANAGEABLE A THOAT AS I HAD EVER SEEN AND WITH A MOUNTED WARRIOR ON EITHER SIDE TO PREVENT THE BEAST FROM BOLTING
AS I DID NOT PARTICULARLY RELISH THE THOUGHT OF THE INNUMERABLE THINGS THEY MIGHT DO TO ME IF THE SPIRIT PROMPTED THEM I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BEFORE A STEALTHY SOUND APPRISED ME OF THEIR NEARNESS AND THEN A WAR BONNETED PAINT STREAKED FACE WAS THRUST CAUTIOUSLY AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE CLIFF
THE ADULT FEMALES RANGED IN HEIGHT FROM TEN TO TWELVE FEET THE CHILDREN WERE LIGHT IN COLOR EVEN LIGHTER THAN THE WOMEN AND ALL LOOKED PRECISELY ALIKE TO ME EXCEPT THAT SOME WERE TALLER
AS HE SUNK TO THE FLOOR I WHEELED AROUND WITH MY BACK TOWARD THE NEAREST DESK EXPECTING TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FELLOWS BUT DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM AS GOOD A BATTLE AS THE UNEQUAL ODDS WOULD PERMIT BEFORE I GAVE UP MY LIFE
WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN STRIKE HER DOWN IT IS HER PLOT KILL HER KILL HER
CHAPTER EIGHT A FAIR CAPTIVE FROM THE SKY THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE INCUBATOR CEREMONY WE SET FORTH TOWARD HOME BUT SCARCELY HAD THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION DEBOUCHED INTO THE OPEN GROUND BEFORE THE CITY
AS THAT ALONE OF ALL BARSOOMIAN METROPOLISES CONSISTS IN TWO IMMENSE CIRCULAR WALLED CITIES
AND AT A SIGN FROM THE LEADER I HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE GROUND AGAIN LOCKING HIS ARM IN MINE WE HAD PROCEEDED INTO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THERE WERE FEW FORMALITIES OBSERVED IN APPROACHING THE MARTIAN CHIEFTAIN
AND AS I EMERGED UPON THE STREET SOLA RUSHED UP TO ME AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF SOME SEARCH ON HER PART THE CAVALCADE WAS RETURNING TO THE PLAZA THE HOMEWARD MARCH HAVING BEEN GIVEN UP FOR THAT DAY NOR IN FACT WAS IT RECOMMENCED FOR MORE THAN A WEEK
BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD
HE HAD A GREAT DESIRE TO SEE AND TO GET NEWS HE WISHED TO KNOW WHO WAS WINNING HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT DESPITE HIS UNPRECEDENTED SUFFERING HE HAD NEVER LOST HIS GREED FOR A VICTORY
I KNOW I'M A BLACKSMITH AT TAKIN KEER A SICK FOLKS AN YEH NEVER SQUEAKED
I M FRAID I LL FALL DOWN AN THEM YEH KNOW THEM DAMNED ARTILLERY WAGONS
AND WITH THE LIGHT OF EXCITEMENT AND EXPECTANCY IN HIS EYES ALMOST DEFEATING THE GLOW OF REGRET FOR THE HOME BONDS HE HAD SEEN TWO TEARS LEAVING THEIR TRAILS ON HIS MOTHER'S SCARRED CHEEKS STILL
AND MEN SLOWING TO HIS DREARY PACE WERE WALKING WITH HIM THEY WERE DISCUSSING HIS PLIGHT QUESTIONING HIM AND GIVING HIM ADVICE IN A DOGGED WAY HE REPELLED THEM
A LITTLE PANIC FEAR GREW IN HIS MIND AS HIS IMAGINATION WENT FORWARD TO A FIGHT HE SAW HIDEOUS POSSIBILITIES HE CONTEMPLATED THE LURKING MENACES OF THE FUTURE
A NEGRO TEAMSTER WHO HAD BEEN DANCING UPON A CRACKER BOX
THE BODY SEEMED TO BOUNCE A LITTLE WAY FROM THE EARTH GOD SAID THE TATTERED SOLDIER THE YOUTH HAD WATCHED SPELLBOUND THIS CEREMONY AT THE PLACE OF MEETING
HE CLUTCHED THE YOUTH'S ARM AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HIM AS IF DREADING TO BE OVERHEARD THEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK IN A SHAKING WHISPER I TELL YEH WHAT I'M FRAID OF HENRY I'LL TELL YEH WHAT I'M FRAID OF
IN THE MORNING THEY WERE ROUTED OUT WITH EARLY ENERGY AND HUSTLED ALONG A NARROW ROAD THAT LED DEEP INTO THE FOREST IT WAS DURING THIS RAPID MARCH THAT THE REGIMENT LOST MANY OF THE MARKS OF A NEW COMMAND
DOUBTS AND HE WERE STRUGGLING HE WOULD TRULY BE A WORM IF ANY OF HIS COMRADES SHOULD SEE HIM RETURNING THUS THE MARKS OF HIS FLIGHT UPON HIM
HE SAID ALOUD HE FELT THAT IN THIS CRISIS HIS LAWS OF LIFE WERE USELESS
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER AND DARKER GIRL WHOM HE HAD GAZED AT STEADFASTLY AND HE THOUGHT SHE GREW DEMURE AND SAD AT SIGHT OF HIS BLUE AND BRASS
WILD YELLS CAME FROM BEHIND THE WALLS OF SMOKE A SKETCH IN GRAY AND RED DISSOLVED INTO A MOBLIKE BODY OF MEN WHO GALLOPED LIKE WILD HORSES THE VETERAN REGIMENTS ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE THREE HUNDRED FOURTH IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO JEER
THESE FACES EXPRESSED IN THEIR LINES THE DEEP STUPOR OF THE TIRED SOLDIERS THEY MADE THEM APPEAR LIKE MEN DRUNK WITH WINE THIS BIT OF FOREST MIGHT HAVE APPEARED TO AN ETHEREAL WANDERER
I GOT SHOT YES B'JIMINEY I GOT SHOT HE REITERATED THIS FACT IN A BEWILDERED WAY AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT CAME ABOUT
BUT NO ONE QUESTIONED HIS RIGHT TO DEAL IN SUCH WORDS AND PRESENTLY HE RECOVERED HIS AIR OF COURAGE HE WENT ON TO REPEAT A STATEMENT HE HAD HEARD GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP AT THE CAMP THAT MORNING THE BRIGADIER SAID HE NEVER SAW A NEW REG'MENT FIGHT THE WAY WE FOUGHT YESTIRDAY DIDN'T HE
HER BROWN FACE UPRAISED WAS STAINED WITH TEARS AND HER SPARE FORM WAS QUIVERING HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND WENT ON FEELING SUDDENLY ASHAMED OF HIS PURPOSES FROM HIS HOME HE HAD GONE TO THE SEMINARY
AND IT COULD ALWAYS BE SEEN THAT THEY WERE BEWILDERED BY THE ALLEGED NEWS AND COULD NOT FULLY COMPREHEND A DEFEAT BEFORE THE GRAY MISTS HAD BEEN TOTALLY OBLITERATED BY THE SUN RAYS THE REGIMENT WAS MARCHING IN A SPREAD COLUMN THAT WAS RETIRING CAREFULLY THROUGH THE WOODS
HE BECAME AWARE THAT THE FURNACE ROAR OF THE BATTLE WAS GROWING LOUDER GREAT BLOWN CLOUDS HAD FLOATED TO THE STILL HEIGHTS OF AIR BEFORE HIM THE NOISE TOO WAS APPROACHING
ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO LEAVE A LITTLE PROTECTION OF STONES AND DIRT TO WHICH HE HAD DEVOTED MUCH CARE AND SKILL WHEN THE REGIMENT WAS ALIGNED IN ANOTHER POSITION EACH MAN'S REGARD FOR HIS SAFETY CAUSED ANOTHER LINE OF SMALL INTRENCHMENTS
THE YOUTH LOOKED KEENLY AT THE ASHEN FACE THE WIND RAISED THE TAWNY BEARD IT MOVED AS IF A HAND WERE STROKING IT HE VAGUELY DESIRED TO WALK AROUND AND AROUND THE BODY AND STARE
ALSO HE CONTINUED IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE IF HE FOUND HIS REGIMENT WELL HE COULD FIGHT WITH ANY REGIMENT HE STARTED FORWARD SLOWLY HE STEPPED AS IF HE EXPECTED TO TREAD UPON SOME EXPLOSIVE THING
YER A RIGHT DUM GOOD FELLER THIS SENTIMENT FLOATING TO HIM UPON THE STILL AIR HAD MADE HIM TEMPORARILY REGRET WAR
AND NOW THEY WERE TAKING HIM OUT TO BE SLAUGHTERED THE REGIMENT SLID DOWN A BANK AND WALLOWED ACROSS A LITTLE STREAM THE MOURNFUL CURRENT MOVED SLOWLY ON AND FROM THE WATER SHADED BLACK
OBSERVED A MAN HIS FRIEND RECENTLY AROUSED WAS STILL VERY DROWSY HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM UNTIL HIS MIND TOOK IN THE MEANING OF THE MOVEMENT THEN HE SIGHED OH WELL I S'POSE WE GOT LICKED
THEN IT BEGAN TO SWING FORWARD SLOW AND STRAIGHT IN THE MANNER OF A FALLING TREE A SWIFT MUSCULAR CONTORTION MADE THE LEFT SHOULDER STRIKE THE GROUND FIRST
AS A SCENE OF THE RESULT OF SOME FRIGHTFUL DEBAUCH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIRE THE YOUTH OBSERVED AN OFFICER ASLEEP SEATED BOLT UPRIGHT WITH HIS BACK AGAINST A TREE THERE WAS SOMETHING PERILOUS IN HIS POSITION
PRESENTLY THE CALM HEAD OF A FORWARD GOING COLUMN OF INFANTRY APPEARED IN THE ROAD IT CAME SWIFTLY ON AVOIDING THE OBSTRUCTIONS GAVE IT THE SINUOUS MOVEMENT OF A SERPENT THE MEN AT THE HEAD
SPRAWLING IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE POSTURE GLANCING NARROWLY INTO THE MORE DISTANT DARKNESS HE CAUGHT OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF VISAGES THAT LOOMED PALLID AND GHOSTLY LIT WITH A PHOSPHORESCENT GLOW
HE HAD BURNED SEVERAL TIMES TO ENLIST TALES OF GREAT MOVEMENTS SHOOK THE LAND THEY MIGHT NOT BE DISTINCTLY HOMERIC BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE MUCH GLORY IN THEM HE HAD READ OF MARCHES SIEGES CONFLICTS
A HOUSE STANDING PLACIDLY IN DISTANT FIELDS HAD TO HIM AN OMINOUS LOOK THE SHADOWS OF THE WOODS WERE FORMIDABLE HE WAS CERTAIN THAT IN THIS VISTA THERE LURKED FIERCE EYED HOSTS
TO HIS ATTENTIVE AUDIENCE HE DREW A LOUD AND ELABORATE PLAN OF A VERY BRILLIANT CAMPAIGN WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THE BLUE CLOTHED MEN SCATTERED INTO SMALL ARGUING GROUPS BETWEEN THE ROWS OF SQUAT BROWN HUTS
I'VE HAD AN AWFUL TIME I'VE BEEN ALL OVER
THEN AS IF THE HEADS WERE MOVED BY ONE MUSCLE ALL THE FACES WERE TURNED TOWARD HIM WITH WIDE DERISIVE GRINS HE SEEMED TO HEAR SOME ONE MAKE A HUMOROUS REMARK IN A LOW TONE AT IT THE OTHERS ALL CROWED AND CACKLED
OF A SUDDEN HE CONFRONTED A BLACK AND MONSTROUS FIGURE A RIFLE BARREL CAUGHT SOME GLINTING BEAMS HALT HALT HE WAS DISMAYED FOR A MOMENT BUT HE PRESENTLY THOUGHT THAT HE
SWIFT PICTURES OF HIMSELF APART YET IN HIMSELF CAME TO HIM A BLUE DESPERATE FIGURE LEADING LURID CHARGES WITH ONE KNEE FORWARD AND A BROKEN BLADE HIGH A BLUE DETERMINED FIGURE
HE SUBMITTED PASSIVELY TO THE LATTER'S DIRECTING STRENGTH HIS HEAD WAS IN THE OLD MANNER HANGING FORWARD UPON HIS BREAST HIS KNEES WOBBLED
ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN BED
SIGNING TO THEM TO GO ON AND LEAVE HIM ALONE THE SHADOWS OF HIS FACE WERE DEEPENING AND HIS TIGHT LIPS SEEMED HOLDING IN CHECK THE MOAN OF GREAT DESPAIR THERE COULD BE SEEN A CERTAIN STIFFNESS IN THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS BODY
WERE QUITE OVERWHELMED WITH PRIVILEGES FOR ALL OF ONE AFTERNOON AND IT HAD BEEN A VERY DELICIOUS THING THEY HAD STRUTTED A CERTAIN LIGHT HAIRED GIRL HAD MADE VIVACIOUS FUN AT HIS MARTIAL SPIRIT
YOU TO TAKE THESE HERE THINGS TO MY FOLKS HE ENDED IN A QUAVERING SOB OF PITY FOR HIMSELF HE HANDED THE YOUTH A LITTLE PACKET DONE UP IN A YELLOW ENVELOPE WHY WHAT THE DEVIL BEGAN THE YOUTH AGAIN
THE SIGHT OF THIS STAMPEDE EXERTED A FLOODLIKE FORCE THAT SEEMED ABLE TO DRAG STICKS AND STONES AND MEN FROM THE GROUND THEY OF THE RESERVES HAD TO HOLD ON THEY GREW PALE AND FIRM AND RED AND QUAKING
HIS MUSKET BOUNCED A TRIFLE FROM HIS SHOULDER AT EACH STRIDE AND MADE HIS CAP FEEL UNCERTAIN UPON HIS HEAD HE COULD HEAR THE MEN WHISPER JERKY SENTENCES SAY WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT
I'D DO IT FER YOU WOULDN'T I HENRY HE PAUSED IN PITEOUS ANXIETY TO AWAIT HIS FRIEND'S REPLY THE YOUTH HAD REACHED AN ANGUISH WHERE THE SOBS SCORCHED HIM HE STROVE TO EXPRESS HIS LOYALTY
AND THE RARE WOUND AH HERE WE ARE HE SAID HE AWKWARDLY MADE FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS JEST AS I THOUGHT HE ADDED PRESENTLY YEH'VE BEEN GRAZED BY A BALL
HE HELD THE WOUNDED MEMBER CAREFULLY AWAY FROM HIS SIDE SO THAT THE BLOOD WOULD NOT DRIP UPON HIS TROUSERS THE CAPTAIN OF THE COMPANY TUCKING HIS SWORD UNDER HIS ARM
HIS FACE WAS SO DRY AND GRIMY THAT HE THOUGHT HE COULD FEEL HIS SKIN CRACKLE EACH BONE OF HIS BODY HAD AN ACHE IN IT AND SEEMINGLY THREATENED TO BREAK WITH EACH MOVEMENT HIS FEET WERE LIKE TWO SORES
WITH SUDDEN LIVID RAGE TOWARD THE BATTLEFIELD HE SHOOK HIS FIST HE SEEMED ABOUT TO DELIVER A PHILIPPIC HELL THE RED SUN WAS PASTED IN THE SKY
REGARDING DEATH THUS OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE HE CONCEIVED IT TO BE NOTHING BUT REST AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A MOMENTARY ASTONISHMENT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY COMMOTION OVER THE MERE MATTER OF GETTING KILLED
HE DENOUNCED HIMSELF AS A VILLAIN HE SAID THAT HE WAS THE MOST UNUTTERABLY SELFISH MAN IN EXISTENCE HIS MIND PICTURED THE SOLDIERS WHO WOULD PLACE THEIR DEFIANT BODIES BEFORE THE SPEAR OF THE YELLING BATTLE FIEND
HE HAD OF COURSE BEEN IMPATIENT UNDER THE ORDEAL OF THIS SPEECH IT HAD NOT BEEN QUITE WHAT HE EXPECTED AND HE HAD BORNE IT WITH AN AIR OF IRRITATION
LESS TALKIN AN MORE FIGHTIN IS WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU BOYS I NEVER SAW SECH GABBLING JACKASSES HE PAUSED READY TO POUNCE UPON ANY MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE THE TEMERITY TO REPLY
AN THEN HE SES WE'LL DO SECH FIGHTIN AS NEVER ANOTHER ONE REG'MENT DONE
HE FUSSED AROUND THE FIRE AND STIRRED THE STICKS TO BRILLIANT EXERTIONS HE MADE HIS PATIENT DRINK LARGELY FROM THE CANTEEN THAT CONTAINED THE COFFEE IT WAS TO THE YOUTH A DELICIOUS DRAUGHT
THE YOUTH WISHED HIS FRIEND TO LEAN UPON HIM BUT THE OTHER ALWAYS SHOOK HIS HEAD AND STRANGELY PROTESTED NO NO NO LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE HIS LOOK WAS FIXED AGAIN UPON THE UNKNOWN
HE STARED INTO SPACE TO THE TWO WATCHERS THERE WAS A CURIOUS AND PROFOUND DIGNITY IN THE FIRM LINES OF HIS AWFUL FACE HE WAS INVADED BY A CREEPING STRANGENESS THAT SLOWLY ENVELOPED HIM
BUT THE REGIMENT WAS NOT YET VETERANLIKE IN APPEARANCE
COULD FIND EXCUSES IN THAT LONG SEETHING LANE THEY COULD RETIRE WITH PERFECT SELF RESPECT AND MAKE EXCUSES TO THE STARS HE WONDERED WHAT THOSE MEN HAD EATEN THAT THEY COULD BE IN SUCH HASTE
HE AND THE TATTERED MAN BEGAN A PURSUIT THERE WAS A SINGULAR RACE
YES YES
AND I DON'T SEE ANY SENSE IN FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING YET ALWAYS LOSING THROUGH SOME DERNED OLD LUNKHEAD OF A GENERAL
THE LINE BROKEN INTO MOVING FRAGMENTS BY THE GROUND WENT CALMLY ON THROUGH FIELDS AND WOODS THE YOUTH LOOKED AT THE MEN NEAREST HIM AND SAW FOR THE MOST PART EXPRESSIONS OF DEEP INTEREST
JERKED THE ROPE FRANTICALLY TO TELL THE TWISTED NEWS OF A GREAT BATTLE THIS VOICE OF THE PEOPLE REJOICING IN THE NIGHT HAD MADE HIM SHIVER IN A PROLONGED ECSTASY OF EXCITEMENT LATER HE HAD GONE DOWN TO HIS MOTHER'S ROOM AND HAD SPOKEN THUS MA
WHO WERE CONTINUALLY MELTING INTO THE SCENE TO APPEAR AGAIN FARTHER ON THEY WERE ALWAYS BUSY AS BEES DEEPLY ABSORBED IN THEIR LITTLE COMBATS THE YOUTH TRIED TO OBSERVE EVERYTHING
HE STARTED BLINDLY THROUGH THE GRASS THE YOUTH TURNED ONCE TO LOOK AT THE LASHING RIDERS AND JOUNCING GUNS OF THE BATTERY HE WAS STARTLED FROM THIS VIEW BY A SHRILL OUTCRY FROM THE TATTERED MAN
WELL CRIED THE YOUTH STILL FIDGETING
THAT WERE THROWN AT THEM FROM ALL DIRECTIONS FREQUENTLY OVER THIS TUMULT COULD BE HEARD THE GRIM JOKES OF THE CRITICAL VETERANS BUT THE RETREATING MEN APPARENTLY WERE NOT EVEN CONSCIOUS OF THE PRESENCE OF AN AUDIENCE
AND I'VE PUT IN ALL YER BEST SHIRTS BECAUSE I WANT MY BOY TO BE JEST AS WARM AND COMF'ABLE AS ANYBODY IN THE ARMY WHENEVER THEY GET HOLES IN EM
BUT THEN HE SAID THAT HIS TIRELESS FATE WOULD BRING FORTH WHEN THE STRIFE LULLED FOR A MOMENT A MAN TO ASK OF HIM AN EXPLANATION
THEY WERE AWED AND AFRAID THEY HUNG BACK LEST HE HAVE AT COMMAND A DREADFUL WEAPON AT LAST THEY SAW HIM STOP AND STAND MOTIONLESS HASTENING UP THEY PERCEIVED THAT HIS FACE WORE AN EXPRESSION
THESE TWO HAD SLUMBERED IN AN EMBRACE BUT THE WEAPON HAD BEEN ALLOWED IN TIME TO FALL UNHEEDED TO THE GROUND THE BRASS MOUNTED HILT LAY IN CONTACT WITH SOME PARTS OF THE FIRE
THE MEN HAD BEGUN TO COUNT THE MILES UPON THEIR FINGERS AND THEY GREW TIRED SORE FEET AN DAMNED SHORT RATIONS THAT'S ALL SAID THE LOUD SOLDIER
OFTEN EDGED WITH RED FAR OFF TO THE RIGHT THROUGH A WINDOW IN THE FOREST COULD BE SEEN A HANDFUL OF STARS LYING LIKE GLITTERING PEBBLES ON THE BLACK LEVEL OF THE NIGHT
THEY WERE WORN EXHAUSTED HAVING SLEPT BUT LITTLE AND LABORED MUCH
AS SHE CHANGED HER ATTITUDE HE OFTEN THOUGHT OF IT ON THE WAY TO WASHINGTON HIS SPIRIT HAD SOARED THE REGIMENT WAS FED AND CARESSED AT STATION AFTER STATION
THE SWIFT THOUGHT CAME TO HIM THAT THE GENERALS DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT IT WAS ALL A TRAP SUDDENLY THOSE CLOSE FORESTS WOULD BRISTLE WITH RIFLE BARRELS IRONLIKE BRIGADES WOULD APPEAR IN THE REAR
THERE WAS A REPLY THAT THE INTENT FIGHTERS DID NOT CARE FOR WHAT HAPPENED REARWARD SAVING THAT NO HOSTILE BAYONETS APPEARED THERE IN THE BATTLE BLUR HIS FACE WOULD IN A WAY BE HIDDEN LIKE THE FACE OF A COWLED MAN
AND HE DID NOT CONCEIVE PUBLIC OPINION TO BE ACCURATE AT LONG RANGE IT WAS QUITE PROBABLE THEY WOULD HIT THE WRONG MAN WHO AFTER HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS AMAZEMENT WOULD PERHAPS SPEND THE REST OF HIS DAYS
WITHIN THE GLEAM OF ROSE AND ORANGE LIGHT FROM THE BURNING STICKS WERE OTHER SOLDIERS SNORING AND HEAVING OR LYING DEATHLIKE IN SLUMBER A FEW PAIRS OF LEGS WERE STUCK FORTH RIGID AND STRAIGHT
SOME TALKED OF GRAY BEWHISKERED HORDES WHO WERE ADVANCING WITH RELENTLESS CURSES AND CHEWING TOBACCO WITH UNSPEAKABLE VALOR TREMENDOUS BODIES OF FIERCE SOLDIERY WHO WERE SWEEPING ALONG LIKE THE HUNS OTHERS
AS HE WAS AT LAST COMPELLED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THEM HIS CAPACITY FOR SELF HATE WAS MULTIPLIED IN DESPAIR HE DECLARED THAT HE WAS NOT LIKE THOSE OTHERS HE NOW CONCEDED IT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD EVER BECOME A HERO
SAID THE LATTER WITH INTENSE GLOOM HE WAS QUITE PALE AND HIS GIRLISH LIP WAS TREMBLING
I GOT SHOT TOO HIS FRIEND HAD STEPPED FORWARD QUICKLY WHAT
AND AFTERWARD HE REMEMBERED THAT THE COLOR SERGEANT WAS STANDING WITH HIS LEGS APART AS IF HE EXPECTED TO BE PUSHED TO THE GROUND THE FOLLOWING THRONG WENT WHIRLING AROUND THE FLANK
IF THE ARMY HAD GONE GLORIOUSLY ON HE WOULD BE LOST IF THE DIN MEANT THAT NOW HIS ARMY'S FLAGS WERE TILTED FORWARD HE WAS A CONDEMNED WRETCH HE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO DOOM HIMSELF TO ISOLATION
THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER CAME SWINGING TWO CANTEENS BY THEIR LIGHT STRINGS WELL NOW HENRY OL BOY SAID THE LATTER WE'LL HAVE YEH FIXED UP IN JEST ABOUT A MINNIT HE HAD THE BUSTLING WAYS OF AN AMATEUR NURSE
TO BID ADIEU TO MANY SCHOOLMATES THEY HAD THRONGED ABOUT HIM WITH WONDER AND ADMIRATION HE HAD FELT THE GULF NOW BETWEEN THEM AND HAD SWELLED WITH CALM PRIDE HE AND SOME OF HIS FELLOWS WHO HAD DONNED BLUE
AND WAS IN TRUTH A MAN OF TRADITIONAL COURAGE
TO DISCOVER WHEN HE WOULD RUN WHEREVER HE WENT IN CAMP HE WOULD ENCOUNTER INSOLENT AND LINGERINGLY CRUEL STARES AS HE IMAGINED HIMSELF PASSING NEAR A CROWD OF COMRADES HE COULD HEAR ONE SAY
HE HAD MADE FIRM REBELLION AGAINST THIS YELLOW LIGHT THROWN UPON THE COLOR OF HIS AMBITIONS THE NEWSPAPERS THE GOSSIP OF THE VILLAGE HIS OWN PICTURINGS HAD AROUSED HIM TO AN UNCHECKABLE DEGREE THEY WERE IN TRUTH FIGHTING FINELY DOWN THERE
THERE WOULD BE A ROUNDABOUT VINDICATION OF HIMSELF HE THOUGHT IT WOULD PROVE IN A MANNER THAT HE HAD FLED EARLY BECAUSE OF HIS SUPERIOR POWERS OF PERCEPTION A SERIOUS PROPHET UPON PREDICTING A FLOOD SHOULD BE THE FIRST MAN TO CLIMB A TREE
THERE WAS AN APPALLING IMPRINT UPON THESE FACES THE STRUGGLE IN THE SMOKE HAD PICTURED AN EXAGGERATION OF ITSELF ON THE BLEACHED CHEEKS AND IN THE EYES WILD WITH ONE DESIRE
HE PRESENTLY BEGAN A LONG AND INTRICATE DENUNCIATION OF THE COMMANDER OF THE FORCES MEBBE IT WA'N'T ALL HIS FAULT NOT ALL TOGETHER
A FLAG FLUTTERED OTHER REGIMENTS FLOUNDERED UP THE BANK THE BRIGADE WAS FORMED IN LINE OF BATTLE AND AFTER A PAUSE STARTED SLOWLY THROUGH THE WOODS IN THE REAR OF THE RECEDING SKIRMISHERS
DUST STAINED HAGGARD PANTING FLYING TO THE FRONT AT THE PROPER MOMENT TO SEIZE AND THROTTLE THE DARK LEERING WITCH OF CALAMITY THEN THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE THING BEGAN TO DRAG AT HIM HE HESITATED
THE YOUTH NEVERTHELESS FELT A THREAT HIS MIND SHRANK FROM GOING NEAR TO THE DANGER AND THEREAFTER HE WAS SILENT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SARCASTIC MAN'S WORDS TOOK FROM HIM ALL LOUD MOODS THAT WOULD MAKE HIM APPEAR PROMINENT
INCREASED TO A LOUD AND JOYOUS BURST AND THEN AS THE SUN WENT SERENELY UP THE SKY THROWING ILLUMINATING RAYS INTO THE GLOOMY THICKETS IT BROKE FORTH INTO PROLONGED PEALINGS THE WOODS BEGAN TO CRACKLE AS IF AFIRE
MOVING OFF AND SURVEYING HIS DEED
I'VE THOUGHT IT MIGHT GET TOO HOT FOR JIM CONKLIN IN SOME OF THEM SCRIMMAGES AND IF A WHOLE LOT OF BOYS STARTED AND RUN
HE WAS OBLIGED TO TURN THE OTHER'S HEAD SO THAT THE FULL FLUSH OF THE FIRE LIGHT WOULD BEAM UPON IT HE PUCKERED HIS MOUTH WITH A CRITICAL AIR HE DREW BACK HIS LIPS AND WHISTLED THROUGH HIS TEETH WHEN HIS FINGERS CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE SPLASHED BLOOD
HE WAS IN A FEVER OF IMPATIENCE HE CONSIDERED THAT THERE WAS DENOTED A LACK OF PURPOSE ON THE PART OF THE GENERALS HE BEGAN TO COMPLAIN TO THE TALL SOLDIER I CAN'T STAND THIS MUCH LONGER HE CRIED
THE TALL SOLDIER MADE A LITTLE COMMONPLACE SMILE HELLO HENRY HE SAID THE YOUTH SWAYED ON HIS LEGS AND GLARED STRANGELY HE STUTTERED AND STAMMERED OH JIM OH JIM
STILL HE COULD NOT PUT A WHOLE FAITH IN VETERAN'S TALES FOR RECRUITS WERE THEIR PREY
HE WAS JEST MAD THAT'S WHAT HE WAS WHEN THAT FELLER TROD ON HIS HAND
THEY OCCUPIED THEMSELVES AGAIN IN DRAGGING THEIR OWN TRAGEDIES TOWARD THE REAR SUDDENLY AS THE TWO FRIENDS MARCHED ON THE TALL SOLDIER SEEMED TO BE OVERCOME BY A TREMOR HIS FACE TURNED TO A SEMBLANCE OF GRAY PASTE
HE HAD IMAGINED PEOPLES SECURE IN THE SHADOW OF HIS EAGLE EYED PROWESS BUT AWAKE HE HAD REGARDED BATTLES AS CRIMSON BLOTCHES ON THE PAGES OF THE PAST HE HAD PUT THEM AS THINGS OF THE BYGONE WITH HIS THOUGHT IMAGES
IN THEIR PRESENCE HE COULD NOT PERSIST IN FLYING HIGH WITH THE WINGS OF WAR THEY RENDERED IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SEE HIMSELF IN A HEROIC LIGHT HE TUMBLED HEADLONG HE DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD A SCORCHING THIRST
NEVER CHALLENGING HIS BELIEF IN ULTIMATE SUCCESS
HIDDEN MYSTERIOUS SOLEMN ONCE THE LINE ENCOUNTERED THE BODY OF A DEAD SOLDIER HE LAY UPON HIS BACK STARING AT THE SKY HE WAS DRESSED IN AN AWKWARD SUIT OF YELLOWISH BROWN
HE BELIEVED THAT HE ENVIED A CORPSE THINKING OF THE SLAIN HE ACHIEVED A GREAT CONTEMPT FOR SOME OF THEM AS IF THEY WERE GUILTY FOR THUS BECOMING LIFELESS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN KILLED BY LUCKY CHANCES HE SAID
THE RAVING TEAMSTERS SWORE MANY STRANGE OATHS THE COMMANDS TO MAKE WAY HAD THE RING OF A GREAT IMPORTANCE IN THEM THE MEN WERE GOING FORWARD TO THE HEART OF THE DIN THEY WERE TO CONFRONT THE EAGER RUSH OF THE ENEMY
YOU'VE BEEN JAWIN LIKE A LOT A OLD HENS
THE WOODS FILTERED MEN AND THE FIELDS BECAME DOTTED AS HE ROUNDED A HILLOCK HE PERCEIVED THAT THE ROADWAY WAS NOW A CRYING MASS OF WAGONS TEAMS AND MEN
TER'BLE FIGHTIN OVER THERE I HAD AN AWFUL TIME I GOT SEPARATED FROM THE REG'MENT
DURING THE MARCH THE ARDOR WHICH THE YOUTH HAD ACQUIRED WHEN OUT OF VIEW OF THE FIELD RAPIDLY FADED TO NOTHING HIS CURIOSITY WAS QUITE EASILY SATISFIED
THE INSECT VOICES OF THE NIGHT SANG SOLEMNLY AFTER THIS CROSSING THE YOUTH ASSURED HIMSELF THAT AT ANY MOMENT THEY MIGHT BE SUDDENLY AND FEARFULLY ASSAULTED FROM THE CAVES OF THE LOWERING WOODS HE KEPT HIS EYES WATCHFULLY UPON THE DARKNESS
THE HOOFS OF HIS HORSE OFTEN THREATENED THE HEADS OF THE RUNNING MEN BUT THEY SCAMPERED WITH SINGULAR FORTUNE IN THIS RUSH THEY WERE APPARENTLY ALL DEAF AND BLIND THEY HEEDED NOT THE LARGEST AND LONGEST OF THE OATHS
NOW HENRY HE SAID LET'S HAVE LOOK AT YER OL HEAD
HE MOVED WITH MYSTERIOUS PURPOSE AND ALL OF THE YOUTH'S OFFERS HE BRUSHED ASIDE NO NO LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE THE YOUTH HAD TO FOLLOW
THE TROOPS SIFTING THROUGH THE FOREST WERE SULLEN IN THE YOUTH'S COMPANY ONCE A MAN'S LAUGH RANG OUT A DOZEN SOLDIERS TURNED THEIR FACES QUICKLY TOWARD HIM AND FROWNED WITH VAGUE DISPLEASURE
OF HEAVY CROWNS AND HIGH CASTLES THERE WAS A PORTION OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY WHICH HE HAD REGARDED AS THE TIME OF WARS BUT IT HE THOUGHT HAD BEEN LONG GONE OVER THE HORIZON
SOME BUILT COMPARATIVELY LARGE ONES WHILE OTHERS SEEMS CONTENT WITH LITTLE ONES THIS PROCEDURE CAUSED A DISCUSSION AMONG THE MEN SOME WISHED TO FIGHT LIKE DUELISTS BELIEVING IT TO BE CORRECT TO STAND ERECT AND BE
GOT CAREFULLY DOWN LIKE A CRONE STOOPING HE STRETCHED OUT WITH A MURMUR OF RELIEF AND COMFORT THE GROUND FELT LIKE THE SOFTEST COUCH
THE BATTLE REFLECTION THAT SHONE FOR AN INSTANT IN THE FACES ON THE MAD CURRENT MADE THE YOUTH FEEL THAT FORCEFUL HANDS FROM HEAVEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE HELD HIM IN PLACE IF HE COULD HAVE GOT INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF HIS LEGS
HE SUSPECTED THEM TO BE IMPOSSIBLE PICTURES
THUNDER SAID THE YOUTH OH YOU'LL SEE FIGHTING THIS TIME MY BOY WHAT'LL BE REGULAR OUT AND OUT FIGHTING
BUT AS HE MORTALLY FEARED THESE SHAFTS IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO INVENT A TALE HE FELT HE COULD TRUST HE EXPERIMENTED WITH MANY SCHEMES BUT THREW THEM ASIDE ONE BY ONE AS FLIMSY
HIS LOWER JAW HUNG DOWN AS IF LACKING STRENGTH TO ASSUME ITS NORMAL POSITION HE WAS THE PICTURE OF AN EXHAUSTED SOLDIER AFTER A FEAST OF WAR HE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE TO SLEEP WITH HIS SWORD IN HIS ARMS
THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO MINGLE IN ONE OF THOSE GREAT AFFAIRS OF THE EARTH HE HAD OF COURSE DREAMED OF BATTLES ALL HIS LIFE OF VAGUE AND BLOODY CONFLICTS THAT HAD THRILLED HIM WITH THEIR SWEEP AND FIRE IN VISIONS HE HAD SEEN HIMSELF IN MANY STRUGGLES
THE DISORDERED HURRYING LINES OF THE ENEMY COULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN DOWN THROUGH THE GROVES AND LITTLE FIELDS THEY WERE YELLING SHRILL AND EXULTANT AT THIS SIGHT THE YOUTH FORGOT MANY PERSONAL MATTERS AND BECAME GREATLY ENRAGED HE EXPLODED IN LOUD SENTENCES
HE WAS QUICK TO SEE VULNERABLE PLACES IN THEM ALL FURTHERMORE HE WAS MUCH AFRAID THAT SOME ARROW OF SCORN MIGHT LAY HIM MENTALLY LOW BEFORE HE COULD RAISE HIS PROTECTING TALE
ITS RAYS SHINING UPON THE MOVING MASSES OF TROOPS BROUGHT FORTH HERE AND THERE SUDDEN GLEAMS OF SILVER OR GOLD UPON THE OTHER SHORE A DARK AND MYSTERIOUS RANGE OF HILLS WAS CURVED AGAINST THE SKY
AWAITED THE MOMENT WHEN THE GRAY SHADOWS OF THE WOODS BEFORE THEM SHOULD BE SLASHED BY THE LINES OF FLAME THERE WAS MUCH GROWLING AND SWEARING GOOD GAWD THE YOUTH GRUMBLED WE'RE ALWAYS BEING CHASED AROUND LIKE RATS IT MAKES ME SICK
THE OFFICER'S PROFANITY SOUNDED CONVENTIONAL IT RELIEVED THE TIGHTENED SENSES OF THE NEW MEN IT WAS AS IF HE HAD HIT HIS FINGERS WITH A TACK HAMMER AT HOME
FROM THE OTHER CANTEEN UPON THE MIDDLE OF IT THIS CRUDE ARRANGEMENT HE BOUND OVER THE YOUTH'S HEAD
NO SECH THING HANNISES BATT'RY WAS LONG HERE BOUT A MINUTE AGO THAT YOUNG HASBROUCK HE MAKES A GOOD OFF'CER
WITH THE PASSIONATE SONG OF THE BULLETS AND THE BANSHEE SHRIEKS OF SHELLS WERE MINGLED LOUD CATCALLS AND BITS OF FACETIOUS ADVICE CONCERNING PLACES OF SAFETY
BADGERED BY DREAMS PERHAPS HE SWAYED WITH LITTLE BOUNCES AND STARTS LIKE AN OLD TODDY STRICKEN GRANDFATHER IN A CHIMNEY CORNER DUST AND STAINS WERE UPON HIS FACE
IN A SHORT TIME THERE WAS QUITE A BARRICADE ALONG THE REGIMENTAL FRONTS DIRECTLY HOWEVER THEY WERE ORDERED TO WITHDRAW FROM THAT PLACE
THAT PREVIOUSLY THE ARMY HAD ENCOUNTERED GREAT DEFEATS AND IN A FEW MONTHS HAD SHAKEN OFF ALL BLOOD AND TRADITION OF THEM EMERGING AS BRIGHT AND VALIANT AS A NEW ONE THRUSTING OUT OF SIGHT THE MEMORY OF DISASTER
HE COULD HAVE WEPT IN HIS LONGINGS HE SEARCHED ABOUT IN HIS MIND FOR AN ADEQUATE MALEDICTION FOR THE INDEFINITE CAUSE THE THING UPON WHICH MEN TURN THE WORDS OF FINAL BLAME IT
WHEN HOWEVER THEY BEGAN TO PASS INTO A NEW REGION HIS OLD FEARS OF STUPIDITY AND INCOMPETENCE REASSAILED HIM BUT THIS TIME HE DOGGEDLY LET THEM BABBLE HE WAS OCCUPIED WITH HIS PROBLEM
EACH OF WHICH HAD BEEN AN ENGINEERING FEAT WORTHY OF BEING MADE SACRED TO THE NAME OF HIS GRANDMOTHER IN THE AFTERNOON THE REGIMENT WENT OUT OVER THE SAME GROUND IT HAD TAKEN IN THE MORNING
STORIES OF DISASTER WERE BORNE INTO THEIR MINDS WITH MANY PROOFS THIS DIN OF MUSKETRY ON THE RIGHT GROWING LIKE A RELEASED GENIE OF SOUND EXPRESSED AND EMPHASIZED THE ARMY'S PLIGHT THE MEN WERE DISHEARTENED AND BEGAN TO MUTTER
HE REMARKED SADLY THE YOUTH HAD A THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE HANDSOME FOR HIM TO FREELY CONDEMN OTHER MEN HE MADE AN ATTEMPT TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF BUT THE WORDS UPON HIS TONGUE WERE TOO BITTER
BUT HERE HE WAS CONFRONTED WITH A THING OF MOMENT
THE YOUTH CONTEMPLATED HIS FRIEND WITH GRATEFUL EYES UPON HIS ACHING AND SWELLING HEAD THE COLD CLOTH WAS LIKE A TENDER WOMAN'S HAND YEH DON'T HOLLER NER SAY NOTHIN REMARKED HIS FRIEND APPROVINGLY
FROM THE HEAVING TANGLE ISSUED EXHORTATIONS COMMANDS IMPRECATIONS FEAR WAS SWEEPING IT ALL ALONG THE CRACKING WHIPS BIT AND HORSES PLUNGED AND TUGGED
THE WHITE TOPPED WAGONS STRAINED AND STUMBLED IN THEIR EXERTIONS LIKE FAT SHEEP THE YOUTH FELT COMFORTED IN A MEASURE BY THIS SIGHT THEY WERE ALL RETREATING PERHAPS THEN HE WAS NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL
HE COULD SEE THE FORMS OF MEN THROWING BLACK SHADOWS IN THE RED LIGHT AND AS HE WENT NEARER IT BECAME KNOWN TO HIM IN SOME WAY THAT THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH SLEEPING MEN
ONCE WHEN THE COMMAND HAD FIRST COME TO THE FIELD SOME PERAMBULATING VETERANS NOTING THE LENGTH OF THEIR COLUMN HAD ACCOSTED THEM THUS
THEY BEGAN TO HAVE THOUGHTS OF A SOLEMN CEREMONY THERE WAS SOMETHING RITE LIKE IN THESE MOVEMENTS OF THE DOOMED SOLDIER AND THERE WAS A RESEMBLANCE IN HIM TO A DEVOTEE OF A MAD RELIGION BLOOD SUCKING MUSCLE WRENCHING BONE CRUSHING
BALANCING AWKWARDLY ON ONE FOOT HE HAD NO RIFLE HE COULD NOT FIGHT WITH HIS HANDS SAID HE RESENTFULLY TO HIS PLAN WELL RIFLES COULD BE HAD FOR THE PICKING THEY WERE EXTRAORDINARILY PROFUSE
SO'S I KIN DERN EM AN ALLUS BE CAREFUL AN CHOOSE YER COMP'NY THERE'S LOTS OF BAD MEN IN THE ARMY HENRY THE ARMY MAKES EM WILD AND THEY LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN THE JOB OF LEADING OFF A YOUNG FELLER LIKE YOU
CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE YOUTH WENT SLOWLY TOWARD THE FIRE INDICATED BY HIS DEPARTED FRIEND AS HE REELED HE BETHOUGHT HIM OF THE WELCOME HIS COMRADES WOULD GIVE HIM
YES IT HURTS HURTS A GOOD DEAL HE REPLIED THERE WAS A FALTERING IN HIS VOICE OH SAID THE CORPORAL HE LINKED HIS ARM IN THE YOUTH'S AND DREW HIM FORWARD COME ON HENRY
A MOUNTED OFFICER DISPLAYED THE FURIOUS ANGER OF A SPOILED CHILD HE RAGED WITH HIS HEAD HIS ARMS AND HIS LEGS ANOTHER
WAS UPON THE LOG WALLS AND THREE RIFLES WERE PARALLELED ON PEGS EQUIPMENTS HUNG ON HANDY PROJECTIONS AND SOME TIN DISHES LAY UPON A SMALL PILE OF FIREWOOD A FOLDED TENT WAS SERVING AS A ROOF THE SUNLIGHT WITHOUT
I'VE GOT YOUR THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER SNARLED
POOR OL BOY WE MUST HOL ON A MINNIT WHAT AM I DOIN I'LL CALL SIMPSON ANOTHER FIGURE AT THAT MOMENT LOOMED IN THE GLOOM
OR TO DEVELOP EM OR SOMETHING
DON'T FORGIT ABOUT THE SOCKS AND THE SHIRTS CHILD AND I'VE PUT A CUP OF BLACKBERRY JAM WITH YER BUNDLE BECAUSE I KNOW YEH LIKE IT ABOVE ALL THINGS GOOD BY HENRY WATCH OUT AND BE A GOOD BOY
BILL HE RAISED A HELUVA ROW I HEAR HE'S A FUNNY FELLER THE DIN IN FRONT SWELLED TO A TREMENDOUS CHORUS THE YOUTH AND HIS FELLOWS WERE FROZEN TO SILENCE THEY COULD SEE A FLAG THAT TOSSED IN THE SMOKE ANGRILY
A BRIGADE AHEAD OF THEM AND ON THE RIGHT WENT INTO ACTION WITH A RENDING ROAR IT WAS AS IF IT HAD EXPLODED AND THEREAFTER IT LAY STRETCHED IN THE DISTANCE BEHIND A LONG GRAY WALL
HE HAD A CONVICTION THAT HE WOULD SOON FEEL IN HIS SORE HEART THE BARBED MISSILES OF RIDICULE HE HAD NO STRENGTH TO INVENT A TALE HE WOULD BE A SOFT TARGET HE MADE VAGUE PLANS TO GO OFF INTO THE DEEPER DARKNESS AND HIDE
BILL WASN'T SCARED EITHER NO SIR IT WASN'T THAT
THE PHILOSOPHICAL TALL SOLDIER MEASURED A SANDWICH OF CRACKER AND PORK AND SWALLOWED IT IN A NONCHALANT MANNER
THE YOUTH MADE NO REPLY BUT BEGAN TO FUMBLE WITH THE BUTTONS OF HIS JACKET WELL COME NOW CONTINUED HIS FRIEND
HE TILTED HIS HEAD AFAR BACK AND HELD THE CANTEEN LONG TO HIS LIPS THE COOL MIXTURE WENT CARESSINGLY DOWN HIS BLISTERED THROAT HAVING FINISHED HE SIGHED WITH COMFORTABLE DELIGHT
AS IF THEY WERE INVESTIGATING SOMETHING THAT HAD FASCINATED THEM ONE OR TWO STEPPED WITH OVERVALIANT AIRS AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY PLUNGED INTO WAR
THIS PART OF THE WORLD LED A STRANGE BATTLEFUL EXISTENCE THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT WAS MARCHED TO RELIEVE A COMMAND THAT HAD LAIN LONG IN SOME DAMP TRENCHES THE MEN TOOK POSITIONS BEHIND A CURVING LINE OF RIFLE PITS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED UP LIKE A LARGE FURROW
THERE WAS A SUDDEN SINKING OF HIS FORCES HE THOUGHT HE MUST HASTEN TO PRODUCE HIS TALE TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE MISSILES ALREADY ON THE LIPS OF HIS REDOUBTABLE COMRADES SO STAGGERING BEFORE THE LOUD SOLDIER HE BEGAN
FROM THEIR FEET TO THEIR FOREHEADS A MARK THEY SAID THEY SCORNED THE DEVICES OF THE CAUTIOUS BUT THE OTHERS SCOFFED IN REPLY AND POINTED TO THE VETERANS ON THE FLANKS WHO WERE DIGGING AT THE GROUND LIKE TERRIERS
SAID THE OTHER IN A TOLERANT WAY OF
OH SHUT UP ROARED THE TALL PRIVATE YOU LITTLE FOOL YOU LITTLE DAMN CUSS
IT'S OUR LUCK T GIT LICKED OFTEN SAID HIS FRIEND IN A WEARY TONE HE WAS TRUDGING ALONG WITH STOOPED SHOULDERS AND SHIFTING EYES LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CANED AND KICKED WELL DON'T WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL
AS THE LATTER SLOWLY TURNED HIS WAXLIKE FEATURES TOWARD HIM THE YOUTH SCREAMED
BECAUSE OF THE TATTERED SOLDIER'S QUESTION HE NOW FELT THAT HIS SHAME COULD BE VIEWED HE WAS CONTINUALLY CASTING SIDELONG GLANCES TO SEE IF THE MEN WERE CONTEMPLATING THE LETTERS OF GUILT HE FELT BURNED INTO HIS BROW
BUT YOU CAN'T BET ON NOTHING OF COURSE
PUT IM T SLEEP IN MY BLANKET SIMPSON AN' HOL ON A MINNIT HERE'S MY CANTEEN IT'S FULL A COFFEE
NUMBERS MAKING FUTILE BIDS FOR THE POPULAR
NOT MORE'N FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO WELL
OCCASIONALLY IN THIS LOW ARCHED HALL A SOLDIER WOULD AROUSE AND TURN HIS BODY TO A NEW POSITION THE EXPERIENCE OF HIS SLEEP HAVING TAUGHT HIM OF UNEVEN AND OBJECTIONABLE PLACES UPON THE GROUND UNDER HIM
SAID THE LOUD ONE FROM A CORNER WELL REMARKED THE YOUTH LIKE AS NOT THIS STORY'LL TURN OUT
IT LOOKED TO BE A WRONG PLACE FOR A BATTLE FIELD THE SKIRMISHERS IN ADVANCE FASCINATED HIM
AND WITH NO APPARENT DIFFICULTY GIVE HIM MANY HUNDREDS OF REASONS WHY HE WAS OF VASTLY MORE IMPORTANCE ON THE FARM THAN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
HE HAD PRIVATELY PRIMED HIMSELF FOR A BEAUTIFUL SCENE
A SHELL SCREAMING LIKE A STORM BANSHEE WENT OVER THE HUDDLED HEADS OF THE RESERVES IT LANDED IN THE GROVE AND EXPLODING REDLY FLUNG THE BROWN EARTH THERE WAS A LITTLE SHOWER OF PINE NEEDLES
THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER WATCHED HIS COMRADE WITH AN AIR OF SATISFACTION HE LATER PRODUCED AN EXTENSIVE HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS POCKET
THE FIRE CACKLED MUSICALLY FROM IT SWELLED LIGHT SMOKE OVERHEAD THE FOLIAGE MOVED SOFTLY THE LEAVES WITH THEIR FACES TURNED TOWARD THE BLAZE WERE COLORED SHIFTING HUES OF SILVER
HE SAID HE WAS SICK THAT SMART LIEUTENANT IS COMMANDING G COMPANY
WELL I WANTA DO SOME FIGHTING ANYWAY INTERRUPTED THE OTHER I DIDN'T COME HERE TO WALK
HOL ON A MINNIT CONTINUED THE YOUTH
WHO WERE LYING DOWN BEHIND WHATEVER PROTECTION THEY HAD COLLECTED A BATTERY HAD TRUNDLED INTO POSITION IN THE REAR AND WAS THOUGHTFULLY SHELLING THE DISTANCE THE REGIMENT UNMOLESTED AS YET
I GOT SEPARATED BEGAN THE YOUTH WITH CONSIDERABLE GLIBNESS
HE COULD NOT RAGE IN FIERCE ARGUMENT IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH SANDWICHES DURING HIS MEALS HE ALWAYS WORE AN AIR OF BLISSFUL CONTEMPLATION OF THE FOOD HE HAD SWALLOWED
HE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH SOME NEW THOUGHTS THAT HAD LATELY COME TO HIM HE LAY DOWN ON A WIDE BUNK THAT STRETCHED ACROSS THE END OF THE ROOM IN THE OTHER END CRACKER BOXES WERE MADE TO SERVE AS FURNITURE
ALREADY SHOWN A DEGREE OF MALICE THAT SHOULD REASONABLY MAKE ME DISTRUST YOU MAY NOT EVEN THIS BE A FEINT THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR TRIUMPH BY AFFORDING A WIDER SCOPE FOR YOUR REVENGE HOW IS THIS
THE DAY WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OF SPRING CHEERED EVEN ME BY THE LOVELINESS OF ITS SUNSHINE AND THE BALMINESS OF THE AIR I FELT EMOTIONS OF GENTLENESS AND PLEASURE THAT HAD LONG APPEARED DEAD
AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
I SLACKENED MY PROGRESS I COULD HARDLY SUSTAIN THE MULTITUDE OF FEELINGS THAT CROWDED INTO MY MIND I PASSED THROUGH SCENES FAMILIAR TO MY YOUTH BUT WHICH I HAD NOT SEEN FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS HOW ALTERED EVERY THING MIGHT BE DURING THAT TIME
AND MY VIRTUES WILL NECESSARILY ARISE WHEN I LIVE IN COMMUNION WITH AN EQUAL
THE MURDERER OF MY BROTHER NO SOONER DID THAT IDEA CROSS MY IMAGINATION THAN I BECAME CONVINCED OF ITS TRUTH MY TEETH CHATTERED AND I WAS FORCED TO LEAN AGAINST A TREE FOR SUPPORT THE FIGURE PASSED ME QUICKLY AND I LOST IT IN THE GLOOM
YET SHE APPEARED CONFIDENT IN INNOCENCE AND DID NOT TREMBLE ALTHOUGH GAZED ON AND EXECRATED BY THOUSANDS FOR ALL THE KINDNESS WHICH HER BEAUTY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE EXCITED WAS OBLITERATED IN THE MINDS OF THE SPECTATORS
REMEMBER THAT I HAVE POWER YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF MISERABLE BUT I CAN MAKE YOU SO WRETCHED THAT THE LIGHT OF DAY WILL BE HATEFUL TO YOU YOU ARE MY CREATOR
BUT YOUR DIRECTION WAS NORTHWARDS YOU TOOK ME ON BOARD WHEN MY VIGOUR WAS EXHAUSTED AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK UNDER MY MULTIPLIED HARDSHIPS INTO A DEATH WHICH I STILL DREAD FOR MY TASK IS UNFULFILLED
AND IS CONTINUALLY ON THE DECK APPARENTLY WATCHING FOR THE SLEDGE THAT PRECEDED HIS OWN YET ALTHOUGH UNHAPPY HE IS NOT SO UTTERLY OCCUPIED BY HIS OWN MISERY BUT THAT HE INTERESTS HIMSELF DEEPLY IN THE PROJECTS OF OTHERS
ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
MY BEST YEARS SPENT UNDER YOUR GENTLE AND FEMININE FOSTERAGE HAS SO REFINED THE GROUNDWORK OF MY CHARACTER THAT I CANNOT OVERCOME AN INTENSE DISTASTE TO THE USUAL BRUTALITY EXERCISED ON BOARD SHIP I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED IT TO BE NECESSARY
BUT THEY WANT AS THE PAINTERS CALL IT KEEPING AND I GREATLY NEED A FRIEND WHO WOULD HAVE SENSE ENOUGH NOT TO DESPISE ME AS ROMANTIC AND AFFECTION ENOUGH FOR ME TO ENDEAVOUR TO REGULATE MY MIND WELL
BUT I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW THE ETERNAL TWINKLING OF THE STARS WEIGHED UPON ME AND HOW I LISTENED TO EVERY BLAST OF WIND AS IF IT WERE A DULL UGLY SIROC ON ITS WAY TO CONSUME ME MORNING DAWNED BEFORE I ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE OF
IT IS TRUE WE SHALL BE MONSTERS CUT OFF FROM ALL THE WORLD BUT ON THAT ACCOUNT WE SHALL BE MORE ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER OUR LIVES WILL NOT BE HAPPY BUT THEY WILL BE HARMLESS AND FREE FROM THE MISERY I NOW FEEL OH MY CREATOR
WHEN I FOUND THIS I RESOLVED TO QUIT THE PLACE THAT I HAD HITHERTO INHABITED TO SEEK FOR ONE WHERE THE FEW WANTS I EXPERIENCED
REVIVE WITHIN ME HALF SURPRISED BY THE NOVELTY OF THESE SENSATIONS I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THEM AND FORGETTING MY SOLITUDE AND DEFORMITY DARED TO BE HAPPY
FROM BENEATH THE SNOWY GROUND EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE SHE HAD RISEN
WHICH MIGHT HAVE STAGGERED ANYONE WHO HAD NOT SUCH PROOF OF HER INNOCENCE AS I HAD SHE HAD BEEN OUT THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND TOWARDS MORNING HAD BEEN PERCEIVED BY A MARKET WOMAN
SEVERAL HOURS PASSED AND I REMAINED NEAR MY WINDOW GAZING ON THE SEA IT WAS ALMOST MOTIONLESS FOR THE WINDS WERE HUSHED AND ALL NATURE REPOSED UNDER THE EYE OF THE QUIET MOON
NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE BODY OF THE MURDERED CHILD HAD BEEN AFTERWARDS FOUND THE WOMAN ASKED HER WHAT SHE DID THERE BUT SHE LOOKED VERY STRANGELY AND ONLY RETURNED A CONFUSED AND UNINTELLIGIBLE ANSWER SHE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK
I WAS NOT SORRY I HAD NOW NEGLECTED MY PROMISE FOR SOME TIME AND I FEARED THE EFFECTS OF THE DAEMON'S DISAPPOINTMENT HE MIGHT REMAIN IN SWITZERLAND AND WREAK HIS VENGEANCE ON MY RELATIVES
THE STARS SHONE AT INTERVALS AS THE CLOUDS PASSED FROM OVER THEM THE DARK PINES ROSE BEFORE ME AND EVERY HERE AND THERE A BROKEN TREE LAY ON THE GROUND IT WAS A SCENE OF WONDERFUL SOLEMNITY AND STIRRED STRANGE THOUGHTS WITHIN ME I WEPT BITTERLY
DO NOT ASK ME CRIED I PUTTING MY HANDS BEFORE MY EYES FOR I THOUGHT I SAW THE DREADED SPECTRE GLIDE INTO THE ROOM HE CAN TELL OH SAVE ME SAVE ME
UNITED WITH RICHES A MAN MIGHT BE RESPECTED WITH ONLY ONE OF THESE ADVANTAGES BUT WITHOUT EITHER HE WAS CONSIDERED EXCEPT IN VERY RARE INSTANCES AS A VAGABOND AND A SLAVE DOOMED TO WASTE HIS POWERS FOR THE PROFITS OF THE CHOSEN FEW
AND ALL WITHIN ME WAS TURNED TO GALL AND BITTERNESS
FEARING TO ENCOUNTER IN THE DARK THOSE LARGE LOOSE MASSES WHICH FLOAT ABOUT AFTER THE BREAKING UP OF THE ICE I PROFITED OF THIS TIME TO REST FOR A FEW HOURS IN THE MORNING HOWEVER AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT
AND MAKE OTHERS SO AND ON THE MORROW JUSTINE DIED ELIZABETH'S HEART RENDING ELOQUENCE FAILED TO MOVE THE JUDGES FROM THEIR SETTLED CONVICTION IN THE CRIMINALITY OF THE SAINTLY SUFFERER
MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE
SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM BUT SMILED HE ASSISTED HER TO DISMOUNT AND DISMISSING HER GUIDE CONDUCTED HER INTO THE COTTAGE
PRESENTLY TWO COUNTRYMEN PASSED BY BUT PAUSING NEAR THE COTTAGE THEY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION USING VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS BUT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY SAID AS THEY SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY
BY MY TEARS AND PRAYERS YOU SHALL NOT DIE YOU MY PLAYFELLOW MY COMPANION
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN REPLIED MY BROTHER IN ACCENTS OF WONDER BUT TO US THE DISCOVERY WE HAVE MADE COMPLETES OUR MISERY NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE IT AT FIRST AND EVEN NOW ELIZABETH WILL NOT BE CONVINCED
SHE WORKED UP HER MIND TO AN APPEARANCE OF COURAGE WHEN SHE ENTERED THE COURT SHE THREW HER EYES ROUND IT AND QUICKLY DISCOVERED WHERE WE WERE SEATED A TEAR SEEMED TO DIM HER EYE WHEN SHE SAW US BUT SHE QUICKLY RECOVERED HERSELF
INHABITANTS THESE WONDERFUL NARRATIONS INSPIRED ME WITH STRANGE FEELINGS WAS MAN INDEED AT ONCE SO POWERFUL SO VIRTUOUS AND MAGNIFICENT YET SO VICIOUS AND BASE
BUT I WAS BAFFLED IN EVERY ATTEMPT I MADE FOR THIS PURPOSE
I VOLUNTARILY ENDURED COLD FAMINE THIRST AND WANT OF SLEEP I OFTEN WORKED HARDER THAN THE COMMON SAILORS DURING THE DAY AND DEVOTED MY NIGHTS TO THE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS THE THEORY OF MEDICINE
HENRY WISHED TO DISSUADE ME BUT SEEING ME BENT ON THIS PLAN CEASED TO REMONSTRATE HE ENTREATED ME TO WRITE OFTEN
I HAVE DWELT MANY MONTHS IN THE HEATHS OF ENGLAND AND AMONG THE DESERTS OF SCOTLAND I HAVE ENDURED INCALCULABLE FATIGUE AND COLD AND HUNGER DO YOU DARE DESTROY MY HOPES BEGONE
BY DEGREES I REMEMBER A STRONGER LIGHT PRESSED UPON MY NERVES SO THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SHUT MY EYES DARKNESS THEN CAME OVER ME AND TROUBLED ME BUT HARDLY HAD I FELT THIS WHEN BY OPENING MY EYES AS I NOW SUPPOSE
WHEN HE EMBARKS IN A LITTLE BOAT WITH HIS HOLIDAY MATES ON AN EXPEDITION OF DISCOVERY UP HIS NATIVE RIVER BUT SUPPOSING ALL THESE CONJECTURES TO BE FALSE YOU CANNOT CONTEST THE INESTIMABLE BENEFIT WHICH I SHALL CONFER ON ALL MANKIND
THE CLOUDS SWEPT ACROSS IT SWIFTER THAN THE FLIGHT OF THE VULTURE AND DIMMED HER RAYS WHILE THE LAKE REFLECTED THE SCENE OF THE BUSY HEAVENS RENDERED STILL BUSIER BY THE RESTLESS WAVES
I HAVE ANSWERED YOU YOU MAY TORTURE ME BUT I WILL NEVER CONSENT YOU ARE IN THE WRONG REPLIED THE FIEND AND INSTEAD OF THREATENING I AM CONTENT TO REASON WITH YOU I AM MALICIOUS BECAUSE I AM MISERABLE
THUS I RETURNED HOME AND ENTERING THE HOUSE PRESENTED MYSELF TO THE FAMILY MY HAGGARD AND WILD APPEARANCE AWOKE INTENSE ALARM BUT I ANSWERED NO QUESTION SCARCELY DID I SPEAK I FELT AS IF I WERE PLACED UNDER A BAN AS IF I HAD NO RIGHT TO CLAIM THEIR SYMPATHIES
WHAT I ASK OF YOU IS REASONABLE AND MODERATE I DEMAND A CREATURE OF ANOTHER SEX BUT AS HIDEOUS AS MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION IS SMALL
COULD HE ALLUDE TO AN OBJECT ON WHOM I DARED NOT EVEN THINK COMPOSE YOURSELF SAID CLERVAL WHO OBSERVED MY CHANGE OF COLOUR I WILL NOT MENTION IT IF IT AGITATES YOU
SOMETIMES SEIZED WITH SUDDEN AGONY HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS TALE AT OTHERS HIS VOICE BROKEN YET PIERCING UTTERED WITH DIFFICULTY THE WORDS SO REPLETE WITH ANGUISH
THE RAIN PATTERED DISMALLY AGAINST THE PANES AND MY CANDLE WAS NEARLY BURNT OUT WHEN BY THE GLIMMER OF THE HALF EXTINGUISHED LIGHT I SAW THE DULL YELLOW EYE OF THE CREATURE OPEN IT BREATHED HARD
AND PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DARED NOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR
I WOULD BESTOW EVERY BENEFIT UPON HIM WITH TEARS OF GRATITUDE AT HIS ACCEPTANCE BUT THAT CANNOT BE THE HUMAN SENSES ARE INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS TO OUR UNION YET MINE SHALL NOT BE THE SUBMISSION OF ABJECT SLAVERY
YOUR DISASTER IS IRREPARABLE
AND HER COMPLEXION WONDROUSLY FAIR
GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
AS YET TO UNDERSTAND OR APPLY THEM SUCH AS GOOD DEAREST UNHAPPY I SPENT THE WINTER IN THIS MANNER THE GENTLE MANNERS AND BEAUTY OF THE COTTAGERS GREATLY ENDEARED THEM TO ME
WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OF THESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM
I BORE A HELL WITHIN ME WHICH NOTHING COULD EXTINGUISH WE STAYED SEVERAL HOURS WITH JUSTINE AND IT WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT ELIZABETH COULD TEAR HERSELF AWAY I WISH CRIED SHE THAT I WERE TO DIE WITH YOU
YOU ALONE CAN CONSOLE ELIZABETH SHE WEEPS CONTINUALLY AND ACCUSES HERSELF UNJUSTLY AS THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH HER WORDS PIERCE MY HEART WE ARE ALL UNHAPPY BUT WILL NOT THAT BE AN ADDITIONAL MOTIVE FOR YOU MY SON TO RETURN AND BE OUR COMFORTER
I REST MY INNOCENCE ON A PLAIN AND SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF THE FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDUCED AGAINST ME AND I HOPE THE CHARACTER I HAVE ALWAYS BORNE WILL INCLINE MY JUDGES TO A FAVOURABLE INTERPRETATION WHERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE APPEARS DOUBTFUL OR SUSPICIOUS
SUCH A MAN HAS A DOUBLE EXISTENCE HE MAY SUFFER MISERY AND BE OVERWHELMED BY DISAPPOINTMENTS YET WHEN HE HAS RETIRED INTO HIMSELF HE WILL BE LIKE A CELESTIAL SPIRIT THAT HAS A HALO AROUND HIM
THEY WERE DRESSED IN EXCELLENT CLOTHES AND STILL MORE THEY ENJOYED ONE ANOTHER'S COMPANY AND SPEECH INTERCHANGING EACH DAY LOOKS OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS WHAT DID THEIR TEARS IMPLY
BUT HERE ALSO I AM CHECKED I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NO ENEMY ON EARTH AND NONE SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO WICKED AS TO DESTROY ME WANTONLY DID THE MURDERER PLACE IT THERE I KNOW OF NO OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED HIM FOR SO DOING
OUR SITUATION WAS SOMEWHAT DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY AS WE WERE COMPASSED ROUND BY A VERY THICK FOG WE ACCORDINGLY LAY TO HOPING THAT SOME CHANGE WOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND WEATHER
BUT IT AWAKENED VARIOUS TRAINS OF REFLECTION I SPOKE OF MY DESIRE OF FINDING A FRIEND OF MY THIRST FOR A MORE INTIMATE SYMPATHY WITH A FELLOW MIND THAN HAD EVER FALLEN TO MY LOT AND EXPRESSED MY CONVICTION THAT A MAN
ONE PART WAS OPEN AND BY THAT I HAD CREPT IN BUT NOW I COVERED EVERY CREVICE BY WHICH I MIGHT BE PERCEIVED WITH STONES AND WOOD
I AM WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ACCUSED I HAVE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HER AT ONE TIME FOR FIVE AND AT ANOTHER FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS DURING ALL THAT PERIOD SHE APPEARED TO ME THE MOST AMIABLE AND BENEVOLENT OF HUMAN CREATURES
AND WHOM YOU LOVED WAS A CREATURE CAPABLE OF A CRIME WHICH NONE BUT THE DEVIL HIMSELF COULD HAVE PERPETRATED DEAR WILLIAM
AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD AN ACCUSATION TO MAKE THAT I KNEW THE DESTROYER OF MY FAMILY AND THAT I REQUIRED HIM TO EXERT HIS WHOLE AUTHORITY FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE MURDERER
AND IN MY DYING MOMENTS I SHALL NOT CURSE MY MAKER HIS WORDS HAD A STRANGE EFFECT UPON ME I COMPASSIONATED HIM
AND INSTEAD OF THREATENING I AM CONTENT TO REASON WITH YOU I AM MALICIOUS BECAUSE I AM MISERABLE AM I NOT SHUNNED AND HATED BY ALL MANKIND
THE FORM OF THE MONSTER ON WHOM I HAD BESTOWED EXISTENCE WAS FOREVER BEFORE MY EYES AND I RAVED INCESSANTLY CONCERNING HIM DOUBTLESS MY WORDS SURPRISED HENRY
NECESSARILY ARISE WHEN I LIVE IN COMMUNION WITH AN EQUAL I SHALL FEEL THE AFFECTIONS OF A SENSITIVE BEING AND BECOME LINKED TO THE CHAIN OF EXISTENCE AND EVENTS FROM WHICH I AM NOW EXCLUDED
MY DEAR VICTOR YOU HAVE PROBABLY WAITED IMPATIENTLY FOR A LETTER TO FIX THE DATE OF YOUR RETURN TO US AND I WAS AT FIRST TEMPTED TO WRITE ONLY A FEW LINES MERELY MENTIONING THE DAY ON WHICH I SHOULD EXPECT YOU
EMPLOYED HIS LEISURE HOURS ON HIS INSTRUMENT OR IN CONTEMPLATION NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE LOVE AND RESPECT WHICH THE YOUNGER COTTAGERS EXHIBITED TOWARDS THEIR VENERABLE COMPANION
HIS LIMBS WERE IN PROPORTION AND I HAD SELECTED HIS FEATURES AS BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL GREAT GOD HIS YELLOW SKIN SCARCELY COVERED THE WORK OF MUSCLES AND ARTERIES BENEATH
THE MONSTER SAW MY DETERMINATION IN MY FACE AND GNASHED HIS TEETH IN THE IMPOTENCE OF ANGER SHALL EACH MAN CRIED HE FIND A WIFE FOR HIS BOSOM
THE MORE DEEPLY DID I FEEL THE SPIRIT OF REVENGE ENKINDLED IN MY HEART SNOW FELL AND THE WATERS WERE HARDENED BUT I RESTED NOT
ALL THE LIGHT I ENJOYED CAME THROUGH THE STY
AND HE SHOWED HER A LARGE LOAF AND A PIECE OF CHEESE SHE SEEMED PLEASED AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN FOR SOME ROOTS AND PLANTS WHICH SHE PLACED IN WATER AND THEN UPON THE FIRE
A QUICK BUT NEVER FAILING POWER OF JUDGMENT A PENETRATION INTO THE CAUSES OF THINGS UNEQUALLED FOR CLEARNESS AND PRECISION ADD TO THIS A FACILITY OF EXPRESSION AND A VOICE WHOSE VARIED INTONATIONS
WHAT IT COULD BE AND UTTERED A WILD CRY OF ECSTASY WHEN I DISTINGUISHED A SLEDGE AND THE DISTORTED PROPORTIONS OF A WELL KNOWN FORM WITHIN
I PROCEEDED ACROSS THE FIELDS FOR SEVERAL HOURS UNTIL AT SUNSET I ARRIVED AT A VILLAGE
FROM A MAN ON THE BRINK OF DESTRUCTION AND TO WHOM I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED THAT MY VESSEL WOULD HAVE BEEN A RESOURCE WHICH HE WOULD NOT HAVE EXCHANGED FOR THE MOST PRECIOUS WEALTH THE EARTH CAN AFFORD I REPLIED HOWEVER THAT WE WERE ON A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY TOWARDS THE NORTHERN POLE
I CREPT FORTH FROM MY HIDING PLACE AND WENT IN SEARCH OF FOOD WHEN MY HUNGER WAS APPEASED I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE WELL KNOWN PATH THAT CONDUCTED TO THE COTTAGE ALL THERE WAS AT PEACE
ANY CARE OR BITTER RECOLLECTION I OFTEN REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIM ALLEGING ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT THAT I MIGHT REMAIN ALONE I NOW ALSO BEGAN TO COLLECT THE MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR MY NEW CREATION
AND ASKED US IF THOSE WERE NOT SUFFICIENT ALLUREMENTS TO INDUCE US TO PROLONG OUR JOURNEY AS FAR NORTH AS PERTH WHERE HE RESIDED CLERVAL EAGERLY DESIRED TO ACCEPT THIS INVITATION AND I ALTHOUGH I ABHORRED SOCIETY
DEEP OF AGONY LET HIM FEEL THE DESPAIR THAT NOW TORMENTS ME I HAD BEGUN MY ADJURATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND AN AWE WHICH ALMOST ASSURED ME THAT THE SHADES OF MY MURDERED FRIENDS
AND THE ABSENCE OF THE OBJECT OF WHICH I NOW FEEL AS A MOST SEVERE EVIL I HAVE NO FRIEND MARGARET WHEN I AM GLOWING WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF SUCCESS THERE WILL BE NONE TO PARTICIPATE MY JOY
AH DEAR SISTER HOW CAN I ANSWER THIS QUESTION IF I SUCCEED MANY MANY MONTHS PERHAPS YEARS WILL PASS BEFORE YOU AND I MAY MEET IF I FAIL YOU WILL SEE ME AGAIN SOON OR NEVER
AND A CONVULSIVE MOTION AGITATED ITS LIMBS HOW CAN I DESCRIBE MY EMOTIONS AT THIS CATASTROPHE OR HOW DELINEATE THE WRETCH WHOM WITH SUCH INFINITE PAINS AND CARE I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO FORM
AND AFTER THE USUAL OCCUPATIONS OF AGATHA WERE FINISHED THE ARABIAN SAT AT THE FEET OF THE OLD MAN AND TAKING HIS GUITAR PLAYED SOME AIRS SO ENTRANCINGLY BEAUTIFUL THAT THEY AT ONCE DREW TEARS OF SORROW AND DELIGHT FROM MY EYES
HE READ TO THE OLD MAN AND AGATHA THIS READING HAD PUZZLED ME EXTREMELY AT FIRST BUT BY DEGREES I DISCOVERED THAT HE UTTERED MANY OF THE SAME SOUNDS WHEN HE READ AS WHEN HE TALKED I CONJECTURED THEREFORE
I WAS EXCEEDINGLY SURPRISED ON RECEIVING SO RUDE AN ANSWER FROM A STRANGER
THE REMAINS OF THE HALF FINISHED CREATURE WHOM I HAD DESTROYED
HOW FORTUNATE THAT YOU SHOULD BE HERE AT THE VERY MOMENT OF MY ALIGHTING NOTHING COULD EQUAL MY DELIGHT ON SEEING CLERVAL HIS PRESENCE BROUGHT BACK TO MY THOUGHTS MY FATHER ELIZABETH
WE HAD SCARCELY VISITED THE VARIOUS LAKES OF CUMBERLAND AND WESTMORLAND AND CONCEIVED AN AFFECTION FOR SOME OF THE INHABITANTS WHEN THE PERIOD OF OUR APPOINTMENT WITH OUR SCOTCH FRIEND APPROACHED AND WE LEFT THEM TO TRAVEL ON FOR MY OWN PART
WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OF COLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IF YOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE
BUT I WAS IMPATIENT TO ARRIVE AT THE TERMINATION OF MY JOURNEY WE LEFT EDINBURGH IN A WEEK PASSING THROUGH COUPAR SAINT ANDREW'S
THIS DEATH WILL CARRY DESPAIR TO HIM AND A THOUSAND OTHER MISERIES SHALL TORMENT AND DESTROY HIM AS I FIXED MY EYES ON THE CHILD I SAW SOMETHING GLITTERING ON HIS BREAST I TOOK IT
AS A MURDERESS FROM THE TORTURES OF MY OWN HEART I TURNED TO CONTEMPLATE THE DEEP AND VOICELESS GRIEF OF MY ELIZABETH THIS ALSO WAS MY DOING AND MY FATHER'S WOE AND THE DESOLATION OF THAT LATE SO SMILING HOME
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT SO GREAT A GOOD FORTUNE COULD HAVE BEFALLEN ME BUT WHEN I BECAME ASSURED THAT MY ENEMY HAD INDEED FLED I CLAPPED MY HANDS FOR JOY AND RAN DOWN TO CLERVAL
I HAD NO RIGHT TO WITHHOLD FROM HIM THE SMALL PORTION OF HAPPINESS WHICH WAS YET IN MY POWER TO BESTOW YOU SWEAR I SAID TO BE HARMLESS BUT HAVE YOU NOT ALREADY SHOWN A DEGREE OF MALICE THAT SHOULD REASONABLY MAKE ME DISTRUST YOU
NO WOOD HOWEVER WAS PLACED ON THE EARTH WHICH FORMED THE FLOOR BUT IT WAS DRY AND ALTHOUGH THE WIND ENTERED IT BY INNUMERABLE CHINKS I FOUND IT AN AGREEABLE ASYLUM FROM THE SNOW AND RAIN
AND BY THE BLUE SKY OF HEAVEN AND BY THE FIRE OF LOVE THAT BURNS MY HEART THAT IF YOU GRANT MY PRAYER WHILE THEY EXIST YOU SHALL NEVER BEHOLD ME AGAIN DEPART TO YOUR HOME AND COMMENCE YOUR LABOURS
I DARE NOT EXPECT SUCH SUCCESS YET I CANNOT BEAR TO LOOK ON THE REVERSE OF THE PICTURE CONTINUE FOR THE PRESENT TO WRITE TO ME BY EVERY OPPORTUNITY
WHICH IF AT ALL POSSIBLE CAN ONLY BE EFFECTED BY AN UNDERTAKING SUCH AS MINE THESE REFLECTIONS HAVE DISPELLED THE AGITATION WITH WHICH I BEGAN MY LETTER
AND I BANISHED FROM MY MIND EVERY THOUGHT THAT COULD LEAD TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION BETWEEN TWO AND THREE IN THE MORNING THE MOON ROSE AND I THEN PUTTING MY BASKET ABOARD A LITTLE SKIFF
IN YOUR SOLITARY RAMBLES THAN WITH THESE SCOTCH PEOPLE WHOM I DO NOT KNOW
MAKE ME HAPPY LET ME FEEL GRATITUDE TOWARDS YOU FOR ONE BENEFIT LET ME SEE THAT I EXCITE THE SYMPATHY OF SOME EXISTING THING DO NOT DENY ME MY REQUEST I WAS MOVED
WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR ACTIONS THE COTTAGERS AROSE THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE SUN THE YOUNG WOMAN ARRANGED THE COTTAGE AND PREPARED THE FOOD AND THE YOUTH DEPARTED AFTER THE FIRST MEAL
BUT TO MY EXTREME WONDER
AS IF TO SEEK SOMETHING THAT I HAD LOST AFTER AN INTERVAL I AROSE AND AS IF BY INSTINCT CRAWLED INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE CORPSE OF MY BELOVED LAY THERE WERE WOMEN WEEPING AROUND I HUNG OVER IT
LITTLE DID I THEN EXPECT THE CALAMITY THAT WAS IN A FEW MOMENTS TO OVERWHELM ME AND EXTINGUISH IN HORROR AND DESPAIR ALL FEAR OF IGNOMINY OR DEATH
RISE MY POOR GIRL SAID ELIZABETH WHY DO YOU KNEEL IF YOU ARE INNOCENT I AM NOT ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES I BELIEVED YOU GUILTLESS NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY EVIDENCE UNTIL I HEARD THAT YOU HAD YOURSELF DECLARED YOUR GUILT
THERE WAS THE SAME CANDOUR THE SAME VIVACITY BUT IT WAS ALLIED TO AN EXPRESSION MORE FULL OF SENSIBILITY AND INTELLECT SHE WELCOMED ME WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION YOUR ARRIVAL MY DEAR COUSIN SAID SHE FILLS ME WITH HOPE
AND THOSE BRANCHES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE FROM WHICH A NAVAL ADVENTURER MIGHT DERIVE THE GREATEST PRACTICAL ADVANTAGE TWICE I ACTUALLY HIRED MYSELF AS AN UNDER MATE IN A GREENLAND WHALER AND ACQUITTED MYSELF TO ADMIRATION
WHICH DIFFERED FROM THAT OF MY PROTECTORS SOON AFTER HOWEVER FELIX APPROACHED WITH ANOTHER MAN I WAS SURPRISED AS I KNEW THAT HE HAD NOT QUITTED THE COTTAGE THAT MORNING
MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
HE PERFORMED THE KINDEST ACTION THAT HE COULD TOWARDS THEM BUT I WAS IN REALITY VERY ILL AND SURELY NOTHING BUT THE UNBOUNDED AND UNREMITTING ATTENTIONS OF MY FRIEND COULD HAVE RESTORED ME TO LIFE
HOW HEAVILY AND FATALLY THIS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WEIGHS AGAINST ME BUT I HAVE NO POWER OF EXPLAINING IT AND WHEN I HAVE EXPRESSED MY UTTER IGNORANCE I AM ONLY LEFT TO CONJECTURE CONCERNING THE PROBABILITIES BY WHICH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLACED IN MY POCKET
AND THE DOOR WAS OFF ITS HINGES I ORDERED IT TO BE REPAIRED BOUGHT SOME FURNITURE AND TOOK POSSESSION
THIS SUDDEN CERTAINTY OF LIFE RUSHED LIKE A FLOOD OF WARM JOY TO MY HEART AND TEARS GUSHED FROM MY EYES
AND BROUGHT HOME FIRING SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF SEVERAL DAYS
WHO WAS ALLOWED TO VISIT HER FATHER AND WHO BY HER GESTURES EXPRESSED HER LIVELY GRATITUDE
SWEAR TO ME WALTON THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THAT YOU WILL SEEK HIM AND SATISFY MY VENGEANCE IN HIS DEATH AND DO I DARE TO ASK OF YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY PILGRIMAGE TO ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE NO
WITH AN ANXIETY THAT ALMOST AMOUNTED TO AGONY I COLLECTED THE INSTRUMENTS OF LIFE AROUND ME THAT I MIGHT INFUSE A SPARK OF BEING INTO THE LIFELESS THING THAT LAY AT MY FEET IT WAS ALREADY ONE IN THE MORNING
NOT I BUT SHE SHALL SUFFER THE MURDER I HAVE COMMITTED BECAUSE I AM FOREVER ROBBED OF ALL THAT SHE COULD GIVE ME SHE SHALL ATONE THE CRIME HAD ITS SOURCE IN HER
SOME WEEKS BEFORE THIS PERIOD I HAD PROCURED A SLEDGE AND DOGS AND THUS TRAVERSED THE SNOWS WITH INCONCEIVABLE SPEED
TO THE LAST GENERATION BY DISCOVERING A PASSAGE NEAR THE POLE TO THOSE COUNTRIES TO REACH WHICH AT PRESENT SO MANY MONTHS ARE REQUISITE OR BY ASCERTAINING THE SECRET OF THE MAGNET
AFTER THEIR SUFFERINGS IN THE LAKE OF FIRE I GREEDILY DEVOURED THE REMNANTS OF THE SHEPHERD'S BREAKFAST WHICH CONSISTED OF BREAD CHEESE MILK AND WINE THE LATTER HOWEVER I DID NOT LIKE THEN OVERCOME
THEY REMAINED CONFINED FOR FIVE MONTHS BEFORE THE TRIAL TOOK PLACE THE RESULT OF WHICH DEPRIVED THEM OF THEIR FORTUNE AND CONDEMNED THEM TO A PERPETUAL EXILE FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY THEY FOUND A MISERABLE ASYLUM IN THE COTTAGE IN GERMANY WHERE I DISCOVERED THEM
WHICH SHONE BRIGHTLY ON THE WHITE GROUND
BELOW THIS PICTURE WAS A MINIATURE OF WILLIAM AND MY TEARS FLOWED WHEN I LOOKED UPON IT WHILE I WAS THUS ENGAGED ERNEST ENTERED
THE YOUNG GIRL SPOKE IN HIGH AND ENTHUSIASTIC TERMS OF HER MOTHER WHO BORN IN FREEDOM SPURNED THE BONDAGE TO WHICH SHE WAS NOW REDUCED SHE INSTRUCTED HER DAUGHTER IN THE TENETS OF HER RELIGION
SHE THREW HERSELF AT THE FEET OF ELIZABETH WEEPING BITTERLY MY COUSIN WEPT ALSO OH JUSTINE SAID SHE WHY DID YOU ROB ME OF MY LAST CONSOLATION I RELIED ON YOUR INNOCENCE AND ALTHOUGH I WAS THEN VERY WRETCHED
LISTENING ATTENTIVELY CATCHING AND FEARING EACH SOUND AS IF IT WERE TO ANNOUNCE THE APPROACH OF THE DEMONIACAL CORPSE TO WHICH I HAD SO MISERABLY GIVEN LIFE OH NO MORTAL COULD SUPPORT THE HORROR OF THAT COUNTENANCE
AND WHY DO YOU AGAIN HARDEN YOURSELF TO MY COMPLAINTS I SWEAR TO YOU BY THE EARTH WHICH I INHABIT AND BY YOU THAT MADE ME THAT WITH THE COMPANION YOU BESTOW I WILL QUIT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AND DWELL AS IT MAY CHANCE
ON WHOM THE PUBLIC INDIGNATION WAS TURNED WITH RENEWED VIOLENCE CHARGING HER WITH THE BLACKEST INGRATITUDE SHE HERSELF WEPT AS ELIZABETH SPOKE BUT SHE DID NOT ANSWER MY OWN AGITATION AND ANGUISH WAS EXTREME DURING THE WHOLE TRIAL
YES SAID ELIZABETH I WILL GO ALTHOUGH SHE IS GUILTY AND YOU VICTOR SHALL ACCOMPANY ME I CANNOT GO ALONE THE IDEA OF THIS VISIT WAS TORTURE TO ME YET I COULD NOT REFUSE
I COULD NOT ANSWER NO JUSTINE SAID ELIZABETH HE IS MORE CONVINCED OF YOUR INNOCENCE THAN I WAS FOR EVEN WHEN HE HEARD THAT YOU HAD CONFESSED HE DID NOT CREDIT IT I TRULY THANK HIM
THERE SNOW AND FROST ARE BANISHED AND SAILING OVER A CALM SEA WE MAY BE WAFTED TO A LAND SURPASSING IN WONDERS AND IN BEAUTY EVERY REGION HITHERTO DISCOVERED ON THE HABITABLE GLOBE ITS PRODUCTIONS AND FEATURES
I PERCEIVED THAT THE FALLEN LEAVES HAD DISAPPEARED AND THAT THE YOUNG BUDS WERE SHOOTING FORTH FROM THE TREES THAT SHADED MY WINDOW IT WAS A DIVINE SPRING AND THE SEASON CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO MY CONVALESCENCE
YOU MAY EASILY IMAGINE THAT I WAS MUCH GRATIFIED BY THE OFFERED COMMUNICATION YET I COULD NOT ENDURE THAT HE SHOULD RENEW HIS GRIEF BY A RECITAL OF HIS MISFORTUNES I FELT THE GREATEST EAGERNESS TO HEAR THE PROMISED NARRATIVE
HIS POWER AND THREATS WERE NOT OMITTED IN MY CALCULATIONS A CREATURE WHO COULD EXIST IN THE ICE CAVES OF THE GLACIERS AND HIDE HIMSELF FROM PURSUIT AMONG THE RIDGES OF INACCESSIBLE PRECIPICES WAS A BEING POSSESSING FACULTIES IT WOULD BE VAIN TO COPE WITH
THAT EVEN NOW WHEN THE SCENE IS ON THE POINT OF CLOSING BEFORE ME FOREVER I SHUDDER TO REFLECT ON IT SOME HOURS PASSED THUS BUT BY DEGREES AS THE SUN DECLINED TOWARDS THE HORIZON
GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN
AND JOINED MY SAD TEARS TO THEIRS ALL THIS TIME NO DISTINCT IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND
BY DEGREES I MADE A DISCOVERY OF STILL GREATER MOMENT I FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE POSSESSED A METHOD OF COMMUNICATING THEIR EXPERIENCE AND FEELINGS TO ONE ANOTHER BY ARTICULATE SOUNDS
THE SUN WILL SHINE ON US AS ON MAN AND WILL RIPEN OUR FOOD THE PICTURE I PRESENT TO YOU IS PEACEFUL AND HUMAN AND YOU MUST FEEL THAT YOU COULD DENY IT ONLY IN THE WANTONNESS OF POWER AND CRUELTY
IMMERSED IN A SOLITUDE WHERE NOTHING COULD FOR AN INSTANT CALL MY ATTENTION FROM THE ACTUAL SCENE IN WHICH I WAS ENGAGED MY SPIRITS BECAME UNEQUAL I GREW RESTLESS AND NERVOUS
MY THOUGHTS NOW BECAME MORE ACTIVE AND I LONGED TO DISCOVER THE MOTIVES AND FEELINGS OF THESE LOVELY CREATURES I WAS INQUISITIVE TO KNOW WHY FELIX APPEARED SO MISERABLE AND AGATHA SO SAD I THOUGHT FOOLISH WRETCH
HOW KIND AND GENEROUS YOU ARE EVERY ONE ELSE BELIEVES IN HER GUILT
NETS WERE CAST BUT IN VAIN AFTER PASSING SEVERAL HOURS WE RETURNED HOPELESS
AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY
I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO DISCOVER WHAT QUALITY IT IS WHICH HE POSSESSES THAT ELEVATES HIM SO IMMEASURABLY ABOVE ANY OTHER PERSON I EVER KNEW
MELANCHOLY FOLLOWED BUT BY DEGREES I GAINED A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MY MISERIES AND SITUATION AND WAS THEN RELEASED FROM MY PRISON FOR THEY HAD CALLED ME MAD AND DURING MANY MONTHS AS I UNDERSTOOD A SOLITARY CELL HAD BEEN MY HABITATION
AND THEY PROCURED A SUFFICIENCY OF IT SEVERAL NEW KINDS OF PLANTS SPRANG UP IN THE GARDEN WHICH THEY DRESSED AND THESE SIGNS OF COMFORT INCREASED DAILY AS THE SEASON ADVANCED THE OLD MAN LEANING ON HIS SON
BUT HOW WAS I TO DIRECT MYSELF I KNEW THAT I MUST TRAVEL IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION TO REACH MY DESTINATION BUT THE SUN WAS MY ONLY GUIDE I DID NOT KNOW THE NAMES OF THE TOWNS THAT I WAS TO PASS THROUGH NOR COULD I ASK
FLUNG BY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALAS LIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED
SEVERAL PEOPLE CROWDED TOWARDS THE SPOT THEY SEEMED MUCH SURPRISED AT MY APPEARANCE BUT INSTEAD OF OFFERING ME ANY ASSISTANCE WHISPERED TOGETHER WITH GESTURES THAT AT ANY OTHER TIME
WHO MAY NOT SEE MY NATIVE LAND PERHAPS FOR MANY YEARS I AM HOWEVER IN GOOD SPIRITS MY MEN ARE BOLD AND APPARENTLY FIRM OF PURPOSE NOR DO THE FLOATING SHEETS OF ICE THAT CONTINUALLY PASS US
WHEN THEY WERE NEARLY EXTINGUISHED WHEN NIGHT CAME AGAIN I FOUND WITH PLEASURE THAT THE FIRE GAVE LIGHT AS WELL AS HEAT AND THAT THE DISCOVERY OF THIS ELEMENT WAS USEFUL TO ME IN MY FOOD
BUT THE PAROXYSM OF GRIEF THAT HAD SEIZED THE STRANGER OVERCAME HIS WEAKENED POWERS AND MANY HOURS OF REPOSE AND TRANQUIL CONVERSATION WERE NECESSARY TO RESTORE HIS COMPOSURE HAVING CONQUERED THE VIOLENCE OF HIS FEELINGS
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN WE LANDED WE WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME ON THE SHORE ENJOYING THE TRANSITORY LIGHT AND THEN RETIRED TO THE INN
WHEN ALONE I COULD FILL MY MIND WITH THE SIGHTS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH THE VOICE OF HENRY SOOTHED ME AND I COULD THUS CHEAT MYSELF INTO A TRANSITORY PEACE BUT BUSY UNINTERESTING JOYOUS FACES
HAD DISCOVERED IN HER POCKET THE PICTURE OF MY MOTHER WHICH HAD BEEN JUDGED TO BE THE TEMPTATION OF THE MURDERER THE SERVANT INSTANTLY SHOWED IT TO ONE OF THE OTHERS WHO WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ANY OF THE FAMILY WENT TO A MAGISTRATE AND UPON THEIR DEPOSITION JUSTINE WAS APPREHENDED
THE WIND WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE SOUTH NOW ROSE WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN THE WEST THE MOON HAD REACHED HER SUMMIT IN THE HEAVENS AND WAS BEGINNING TO DESCEND
EACH INTERESTING AND WONDERFUL TO ONE SO UTTERLY INEXPERIENCED AS I WAS THE NAME OF THE OLD MAN WAS DE LACEY HE WAS DESCENDED FROM A GOOD FAMILY IN FRANCE WHERE HE HAD LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN AFFLUENCE
AND LAYING THEM UP DETERMINED TO THROW THEM INTO THE SEA THAT VERY NIGHT AND IN THE MEANTIME I SAT UPON THE BEACH EMPLOYED IN CLEANING AND ARRANGING MY CHEMICAL APPARATUS
THE WIND WAS HIGH AND THE WAVES CONTINUALLY THREATENED THE SAFETY OF MY LITTLE SKIFF
AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE
AND I FOUND NO SHELTER OH EARTH HOW OFTEN DID I IMPRECATE CURSES ON THE CAUSE OF MY BEING
I AM SATISFIED MISERABLE WRETCH YOU HAVE DETERMINED TO LIVE AND I AM SATISFIED I DARTED TOWARDS THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE SOUND PROCEEDED BUT THE DEVIL ELUDED MY GRASP
AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OF MY HIDEOUS NARRATION I ARRIVED AT GENEVA MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNK UNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE
I CONTEMPLATED THE LAKE THE WATERS WERE PLACID ALL AROUND WAS CALM AND THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS THE PALACES OF NATURE WERE NOT CHANGED BY DEGREES THE CALM AND HEAVENLY SCENE RESTORED ME AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TOWARDS GENEVA
AS IT WAS I LIVED UNGAZED AT AND UNMOLESTED HARDLY THANKED FOR THE PITTANCE OF FOOD AND CLOTHES WHICH I GAVE SO MUCH DOES SUFFERING BLUNT EVEN THE COARSEST SENSATIONS OF MEN IN THIS RETREAT I DEVOTED THE MORNING TO LABOUR
WE DO ALSO UNFORTUNATELY REPLIED MY FATHER FOR INDEED I HAD RATHER HAVE BEEN FOR EVER IGNORANT THAN HAVE DISCOVERED SO MUCH DEPRAVITY AND UNGRATITUDE IN ONE I VALUED SO HIGHLY MY DEAR FATHER YOU ARE MISTAKEN JUSTINE IS INNOCENT
DEGENERATING OF THE DECLINE OF THAT MIGHTY EMPIRE OF CHIVALRY CHRISTIANITY AND KINGS I HEARD OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE AMERICAN HEMISPHERE
BUT SHE WAS BATHED IN TEARS AND THROWING HERSELF AT HIS FEET ENTREATED HIM TO SPARE HER CONFESSING AT THE SAME TIME THAT SHE LOVED ANOTHER BUT THAT HE WAS POOR AND THAT HER FATHER WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO THE UNION
YOUR AFFECTIONATE AND AFFLICTED FATHER ALPHONSE FRANKENSTEIN GENEVA MAY TWELFTH
I THANK YOU DARNAY I MAY USE THAT FREEDOM WITH YOUR NAME I THINK SO CARTON BY THIS TIME THEY SHOOK HANDS UPON IT AND SYDNEY TURNED AWAY
DID I SAY WE COULD DEPEND UPON NO BETTER MAN TELL HER TO NIGHT WHAT YOU KNOW OF HER DANGER AS INVOLVING HER CHILD AND HER FATHER DWELL UPON THAT FOR SHE WOULD LAY HER OWN FAIR HEAD BESIDE HER HUSBAND'S CHEERFULLY
AND AFTER EMBRACING THE EVER ZEALOUS AND FAITHFUL PROSS WHO LIFTED HER HE TOOK HIS WIFE IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER UP TO THEIR ROOMS LUCIE MY OWN I AM SAFE O DEAREST CHARLES
THE LAST CHANCE IS GONE IT WAS NOT MUCH YES HE HAD BETTER BE TAKEN TO HER BUT BEFORE YOU GO WILL YOU FOR A MOMENT STEADILY ATTEND TO ME DON'T ASK ME WHY I MAKE THE STIPULATIONS I AM GOING TO MAKE
AT ANOTHER TIME YOU SHALL KNOW MY NAME AND WHO MY MOTHER WAS AND WHO MY FATHER AND HOW I NEVER KNEW THEIR HARD HARD HISTORY BUT I CANNOT TELL YOU AT THIS TIME AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HERE ALL THAT I MAY TELL YOU HERE AND NOW IS
THE PEOPLE WERE SO PASSIONATELY REVENGEFUL AND FITFUL THE INNOCENT WERE SO CONSTANTLY PUT TO DEATH ON VAGUE SUSPICION AND BLACK MALICE IT WAS SO IMPOSSIBLE TO FORGET THAT MANY AS BLAMELESS AS HER HUSBAND AND AS DEAR TO OTHERS AS HE WAS TO HER
IN THE PAUSES OF HIS QUICK AND LABOURED BREATHING HE WAS HEARD TO SAY WHAT IS THIS WITH THE TEARS STREAMING DOWN HER FACE SHE PUT HER TWO HANDS TO HER LIPS AND KISSED THEM TO HIM THEN CLASPED THEM ON HER BREAST AS IF SHE LAID HIS RUINED HEAD THERE
AGES AGO WHAT IS YOUR NAME MY GENTLE ANGEL HAILING HIS SOFTENED TONE AND MANNER HIS DAUGHTER FELL UPON HER KNEES BEFORE HIM WITH HER APPEALING HANDS UPON HIS BREAST O SIR
WITHOUT A MOMENT'S INTERMISSION THE TASK OF RECALLING HIM FROM THE VAGRANCY INTO WHICH HE ALWAYS SANK WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN WAS LIKE RECALLING SOME VERY WEAK PERSON FROM A SWOON OR ENDEAVOURING IN THE HOPE OF SOME DISCLOSURE TO STAY THE SPIRIT OF A FAST DYING MAN
WHEN THE COMMON ROOMS AND CORRIDORS WOULD BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE GREAT DOGS WHO KEPT WATCH THERE THROUGH THE NIGHT THE PRISONERS WERE FAR FROM INSENSIBLE OR UNFEELING THEIR WAYS AROSE OUT OF THE CONDITION OF THE TIME SIMILARLY
IT WAS LIKE THE LAST FEEBLE ECHO OF A SOUND MADE LONG AND LONG AGO SO ENTIRELY HAD IT LOST THE LIFE AND RESONANCE OF THE HUMAN VOICE THAT IT AFFECTED THE SENSES LIKE A ONCE BEAUTIFUL COLOUR FADED AWAY INTO A POOR WEAK STAIN
MISS PROSS CURTSEYED AT THE NAME AND AS SUCH MY MAXIM IS CONFOUND THEIR POLITICS FRUSTRATE THEIR KNAVISH TRICKS ON HIM OUR HOPES WE FIX GOD SAVE THE KING
AND I WILL GO TO OTHERS WHOM IT IS BETTER NOT TO NAME I WILL WRITE TOO AND BUT STAY THERE IS A CELEBRATION IN THE STREETS AND NO ONE WILL BE ACCESSIBLE UNTIL DARK
SHE ALSO BESTOWED A BRITISH COUGH ON MADAME DEFARGE BUT NEITHER OF THE TWO TOOK MUCH HEED OF HER
THE SHADOW ATTENDANT ON MADAME DEFARGE AND HER PARTY SEEMED TO FALL SO THREATENING AND DARK ON THE CHILD THAT HER MOTHER INSTINCTIVELY KNEELED ON THE GROUND BESIDE HER AND HELD HER TO HER BREAST
AND EXACT THE PROMISE I AM GOING TO EXACT I HAVE A REASON A GOOD ONE I DO NOT DOUBT IT ANSWERED MISTER LORRY SAY ON THE FIGURE IN THE CHAIR BETWEEN THEM WAS ALL THE TIME MONOTONOUSLY ROCKING ITSELF TO AND FRO AND MOANING
DOES MADAME GO WITH US INQUIRED MISTER LORRY SEEING THAT SHE MOVED AS THEY MOVED YES THAT SHE MAY BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE THE FACES AND KNOW THE PERSONS IT IS FOR THEIR SAFETY
I HOPE YOU CARE TO BE RECALLED TO LIFE AND THE OLD ANSWER
HOW WAS THIS WAS IT YOU ONCE MORE THE TWO SPECTATORS STARTED AS HE TURNED UPON HER WITH A FRIGHTFUL SUDDENNESS BUT SHE SAT PERFECTLY STILL IN HIS GRASP AND ONLY SAID
IT IS A HUNDRED TO ONE IF I SHOULD AVAIL MYSELF OF IT FOUR TIMES IN A YEAR IT WOULD SATISFY ME I DARE SAY TO KNOW THAT I HAD IT WILL YOU TRY THAT IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT I AM PLACED ON THE FOOTING I HAVE INDICATED
YOU HAD BETTER LUCIE SAID MISTER LORRY DOING ALL HE COULD TO PROPITIATE BY TONE AND MANNER HAVE THE DEAR CHILD HERE AND OUR GOOD PROSS
THAT BROTHER WAS MY BROTHER THAT FATHER WAS MY FATHER
IT FORMED THE ENCAMPMENT FOR THE DAY ON THIS POST OF HIS MISTER CRUNCHER WAS AS WELL KNOWN TO FLEET STREET AND THE TEMPLE AS THE BAR ITSELF
DON'T BE ALARMED I AM NOT GOING TO PREACH I AM NOT AT ALL ALARMED EARNESTNESS IN YOU IS ANYTHING BUT ALARMING TO ME AH SAID CARTON WITH A CARELESS WAVE OF HIS HAND AS IF HE WAVED THAT AWAY ON THE DRUNKEN OCCASION IN QUESTION
WHEN THE BASTILLE FALLS HE FINDS THIS PAPER OF TO DAY AND HE BRINGS IT HOME AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN THIS PLACE IS CLEAR AND SHUT WE READ IT HERE ON THIS SPOT BY THE LIGHT OF THIS LAMP ASK HIM IS THAT SO
NEAR THE BANKING HOUSE AS THERE WAS NO BUSINESS OBJECTION TO THIS AND AS HE FORESAW THAT EVEN IF IT WERE ALL WELL WITH CHARLES AND HE WERE TO BE RELEASED HE COULD NOT HOPE TO LEAVE THE CITY MISTER LORRY WENT OUT IN QUEST OF SUCH A LODGING AND FOUND A SUITABLE ONE
I CAN'T SAY THAT I MEAN TO I SUPPOSE SO I DON'T KNOW BUT THE QUESTION REMINDED HIM OF HIS WORK AND HE BENT OVER IT AGAIN
ONE OF A LARGE NUMBER AS YOU KNOW I WAS INSUFFERABLE ABOUT LIKING YOU AND NOT LIKING YOU I WISH YOU WOULD FORGET IT I FORGOT IT LONG AGO
SINCE LAST NIGHT HE HAD TAKEN NOTHING BUT A LITTLE LIGHT THIN WINE
ONE OF THE FIRST CONSIDERATIONS WHICH AROSE IN THE BUSINESS MIND OF MISTER LORRY WHEN BUSINESS HOURS CAME ROUND WAS THIS THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO IMPERIL TELLSON'S BY SHELTERING THE WIFE OF AN EMIGRANT PRISONER UNDER THE BANK ROOF
YOU CAN BEAR A LITTLE MORE THE SHOEMAKER STOPPED HIS WORK LOOKED WITH A VACANT AIR OF LISTENING AT THE FLOOR ON ONE SIDE OF HIM THEN SIMILARLY AT THE FLOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIM THEN UPWARD AT THE SPEAKER WHAT DID YOU SAY
THIS IS OUR POOR PRISONER'S DARLING DAUGHTER AND ONLY CHILD THE SHADOW ATTENDANT ON MADAME DEFARGE AND HER PARTY SEEMED TO FALL SO THREATENING AND DARK ON THE CHILD
I FEAR NOT YET IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR CHARLES YET
YOU HAVE A VISITOR YOU SEE SAID MONSIEUR DEFARGE WHAT DID YOU SAY HERE IS A VISITOR THE SHOEMAKER LOOKED UP AS BEFORE BUT WITHOUT REMOVING A HAND FROM HIS WORK
AND NOT AUGMENT IT THAT IT QUICKLY RAISED HER EVEN FROM THAT SHOCK THE JUDGES HAVING TO TAKE PART IN A PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION OUT OF DOORS THE TRIBUNAL ADJOURNED THE QUICK NOISE AND MOVEMENT OF THE COURT'S EMPTYING ITSELF
THEY TRIED SPEAKING TO HIM BUT HE WAS SO CONFUSED AND SO VERY SLOW TO ANSWER THAT THEY TOOK FRIGHT AT HIS BEWILDERMENT AND AGREED FOR THE TIME TO TAMPER WITH HIM NO MORE HE HAD A WILD LOST MANNER OF OCCASIONALLY CLASPING HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS THAT HAD NOT BEEN SEEN IN HIM BEFORE
BUT TO USE IT IN HIS BEHALF O SISTER WOMAN THINK OF ME AS A WIFE AND MOTHER
ARE YOU GOING TO FINISH THAT PAIR OF SHOES TO DAY ASKED DEFARGE MOTIONING TO MISTER LORRY TO COME FORWARD WHAT DID YOU SAY DO YOU MEAN TO FINISH THAT PAIR OF SHOES TO DAY
WHILE THE TWINKLING EYES OF THE YOUTHFUL JERRY WERE AS RESTLESSLY WATCHFUL OF HIM AS OF EVERYTHING ELSE IN FLEET STREET THE HEAD OF ONE OF THE REGULAR INDOOR MESSENGERS ATTACHED TO TELLSON'S ESTABLISHMENT WAS PUT THROUGH THE DOOR AND THE WORD WAS GIVEN PORTER WANTED
FIVE WERE TO BE TRIED TOGETHER NEXT AS ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC FORASMUCH AS THEY HAD NOT ASSISTED IT BY WORD OR DEED SO QUICK WAS THE TRIBUNAL TO COMPENSATE ITSELF AND THE NATION FOR A CHANCE LOST
THAT I HEARD STRANGE FEET UPON THE STAIRS MY LOVE THE STAIRCASE IS AS STILL AS DEATH AS HE SAID THE WORD A BLOW WAS STRUCK UPON THE DOOR
SO SUNKEN AND SUPPRESSED IT WAS THAT IT WAS LIKE A VOICE UNDERGROUND SO EXPRESSIVE IT WAS OF A HOPELESS AND LOST CREATURE THAT A FAMISHED TRAVELLER WEARIED OUT BY LONELY WANDERING IN A WILDERNESS
THEY HAD NOT TRAVERSED MANY STEPS OF THE LONG MAIN STAIRCASE WHEN HE STOPPED AND STARED AT THE ROOF AND ROUND AT THE WALLS YOU REMEMBER THE PLACE MY FATHER YOU REMEMBER COMING UP HERE WHAT DID YOU SAY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD REPEAT THE QUESTION
AND THEN THE KNUCKLES OF THE LEFT HAND IN THE HOLLOW OF THE RIGHT
GOING ON IN THE STREETS NOW LADYBIRD NEVER YOU STIR FROM THAT FIRE TILL I COME BACK TAKE CARE OF THE DEAR HUSBAND YOU HAVE RECOVERED AND DON'T MOVE YOUR PRETTY HEAD FROM HIS SHOULDER AS YOU HAVE IT NOW TILL YOU SEE ME AGAIN
I REMEMBER A CERTAIN FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN YOU FORCED ME TO CONFESS THAT YOU HAD BEEN DRINKING I REMEMBER IT TOO THE CURSE OF THOSE OCCASIONS IS HEAVY UPON ME FOR I ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM I HOPE IT MAY BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ONE DAY WHEN ALL DAYS ARE AT AN END FOR ME
FOR MY SAKE THEN BE MERCIFUL TO MY HUSBAND FOR MY CHILD'S SAKE SHE WILL PUT HER HANDS TOGETHER AND PRAY YOU TO BE MERCIFUL WE ARE MORE AFRAID OF YOU THAN OF THESE OTHERS
AND ACHIEVING THEM AGAIN IN GOSSIP GRADUALLY THESE STRINGS OF RAGGED PEOPLE SHORTENED AND FRAYED AWAY AND THEN POOR LIGHTS BEGAN TO SHINE IN HIGH WINDOWS AND SLENDER FIRES WERE MADE IN THE STREETS AT WHICH NEIGHBOURS COOKED IN COMMON
THEY HAD NOT BEEN AT HOME MANY HOURS WHEN HE PRESENTED HIMSELF HE WAS NOT IMPROVED IN HABITS OR IN LOOKS OR IN MANNER BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN RUGGED AIR OF FIDELITY ABOUT HIM WHICH WAS NEW TO THE OBSERVATION OF CHARLES DARNAY
IT IS A SOUND PRECAUTION AND MAY BE A NECESSARY PREPARATION BUT CARE CARE CARE LET ME THINK IT OUT CHECKING HIS STEPS WHICH HAD BEGUN TO TEND TOWARDS AN OBJECT
HE HAD A WHITE BEARD RAGGEDLY CUT BUT NOT VERY LONG A HOLLOW FACE AND EXCEEDINGLY BRIGHT EYES THE HOLLOWNESS AND THINNESS OF HIS FACE WOULD HAVE CAUSED THEM TO LOOK LARGE UNDER HIS YET DARK EYEBROWS AND HIS CONFUSED WHITE HAIR
THAT ON THE DOOR OR DOORPOST OF EVERY HOUSE THE NAME OF EVERY INMATE MUST BE LEGIBLY INSCRIBED IN LETTERS OF A CERTAIN SIZE AT A CERTAIN CONVENIENT HEIGHT FROM THE GROUND MISTER JERRY CRUNCHER'S NAME THEREFORE DULY EMBELLISHED THE DOORPOST DOWN BELOW
HIS EYES CAME SLOWLY BACK AT LAST TO THE FACE FROM WHICH THEY HAD WANDERED WHEN THEY RESTED ON IT HE STARTED AND RESUMED IN THE MANNER OF A SLEEPER THAT MOMENT AWAKE REVERTING TO A SUBJECT OF LAST NIGHT
TELLSON'S THEY SAID WANTED NO ELBOW ROOM TELLSON'S WANTED NO LIGHT TELLSON'S WANTED NO EMBELLISHMENT
UPON MY LIFE SAID CARTON SMILING I FIND THAT EASIER TO COMPREHEND IN MY OWN MIND THAN TO CONVEY TO YOURS HOWEVER LET ME TRY YOU REMEMBER A CERTAIN FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN I WAS MORE DRUNK THAN THAN USUAL
HIGH UP IN A REMOVED BY STREET WHERE THE CLOSED BLINDS IN ALL THE OTHER WINDOWS OF A HIGH MELANCHOLY SQUARE OF BUILDINGS MARKED DESERTED HOMES TO THIS LODGING HE AT ONCE REMOVED LUCIE AND HER CHILD AND MISS PROSS
MISTER LORRY SAW HIM SHRINK INTO THE EXACT FIGURE THAT DEFARGE HAD HAD IN KEEPING AFFECTED AND IMPRESSED WITH TERROR AS THEY BOTH WERE BY THIS SPECTACLE OF RUIN IT WAS NOT A TIME TO YIELD TO SUCH EMOTIONS
SO THAT HIS TEARS AND HER LIPS MIGHT COME TOGETHER UNSEEN A FEW OF THE PEOPLE FELL TO DANCING
GOD KNOWS IT IS A SHAME THEN WHY NOT CHANGE IT LOOKING GENTLY AT HIM AGAIN SHE WAS SURPRISED AND SADDENED TO SEE THAT THERE WERE TEARS IN HIS EYES THERE WERE TEARS IN HIS VOICE TOO AS HE ANSWERED
THAT IT WAS MERE PROFESSIONAL CLAPTRAP I DON'T KNOW THAT I CARED WHAT BECAME OF YOU WHEN I RENDERED IT MIND I SAY WHEN I RENDERED IT I AM SPEAKING OF THE PAST YOU MAKE LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION RETURNED DARNAY BUT I WILL NOT QUARREL WITH YOUR LIGHT ANSWER
THE SHORT RATHER PLUMP WIFE OF A STARVED GROCER AND THE MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN WITHAL THIS LIEUTENANT HAD ALREADY EARNED THE COMPLIMENTARY NAME OF THE VENGEANCE HARK SAID THE VENGEANCE LISTEN THEN WHO COMES
OUTSIDE TELLSON'S NEVER BY ANY MEANS IN IT UNLESS CALLED IN WAS AN ODD JOB MAN AN OCCASIONAL PORTER AND MESSENGER WHO SERVED AS THE LIVE SIGN OF THE HOUSE HE WAS NEVER ABSENT DURING BUSINESS HOURS UNLESS UPON AN ERRAND
OF HEALTH FOR THE SICKLIEST AND OF YOUTH FOR THE OLDEST SYDNEY'S FEET STILL TROD THOSE STONES FROM BEING IRRESOLUTE AND PURPOSELESS HIS FEET BECAME ANIMATED BY AN INTENTION AND IN THE WORKING OUT OF THAT INTENTION
WHO HAD LEFT HER IN EXACTLY THE SAME ATTITUDE SOME SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO IT IS SHE OBSERVED HER HUSBAND DOES MADAME GO WITH US INQUIRED MISTER LORRY SEEING THAT SHE MOVED AS THEY MOVED
BY THE CITIZEN AND CITIZENESS DEFARGE AND BY ONE OTHER WHAT OTHER DO YOU ASK CITIZEN DOCTOR YES
IF WHEN I TELL YOU DEAREST DEAR THAT YOUR AGONY IS OVER AND THAT I HAVE COME HERE TO TAKE YOU FROM IT AND THAT WE GO TO ENGLAND TO BE AT PEACE AND AT REST I CAUSE YOU TO THINK OF YOUR USEFUL LIFE LAID WASTE AND OF OUR NATIVE FRANCE SO WICKED TO YOU WEEP FOR IT
HE CAME TO HER RELIEF WITH A FIXED DESPAIR OF HIMSELF WHICH MADE THE INTERVIEW UNLIKE ANY OTHER THAT COULD HAVE BEEN HOLDEN IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE MISS MANETTE
HIS LONELY DAUGHTER BEREFT OF HER FINAL HOPE AND RELIANCE APPEALED TO THEM BOTH TOO STRONGLY AGAIN AS IF BY AGREEMENT THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER WITH ONE MEANING IN THEIR FACES CARTON WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
YOU KNOW IT IS A CAPITAL CRIME TO MOURN FOR OR SYMPATHISE WITH A VICTIM OF THE GUILLOTINE SHE AND HER FATHER WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY BE GUILTY OF THIS CRIME AND THIS WOMAN THE INVETERACY OF WHOSE PURSUIT CANNOT BE DESCRIBED
THAT AFTER HIS LONG AND UNWHOLESOME CONFINEMENT HE WAS IN DANGER OF FAINTING FROM EXHAUSTION NONE THE LESS BECAUSE HE KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE VERY SAME PEOPLE CARRIED BY ANOTHER CURRENT WOULD HAVE RUSHED AT HIM WITH THE VERY SAME INTENSITY
THAT HE STOOD WITH THE LAMP IN HIS HAND
ALWAYS AND VERY LENIENT ON HIS FAULTS WHEN HE IS NOT BY I WOULD ASK YOU TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS A HEART HE VERY VERY SELDOM REVEALS AND THAT THERE ARE DEEP WOUNDS IN IT MY DEAR I HAVE SEEN IT BLEEDING IT IS A PAINFUL REFLECTION TO ME
AND A LITTLE CONCERT FOR THAT EVENING THEY CROWDED TO THE GRATES AND SHED TEARS THERE BUT TWENTY PLACES IN THE PROJECTED ENTERTAINMENTS HAD TO BE REFILLED AND THE TIME WAS AT BEST SHORT TO THE LOCK UP HOUR
FOR OTHER CRIMES AS TYRANTS AND OPPRESSORS I HAVE THIS RACE A LONG TIME ON MY REGISTER DOOMED TO DESTRUCTION AND EXTERMINATION ASK MY HUSBAND IS THAT SO IT IS SO ASSENTED DEFARGE WITHOUT BEING ASKED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT DAYS
WAS NOT YET EMPTY I WANT SAID DEFARGE WHO HAD NOT REMOVED HIS GAZE FROM THE SHOEMAKER
ADIEU FROM DEFARGE AND SO UNDER A SHORT GROVE OF FEEBLER AND FEEBLER OVER SWINGING LAMPS OUT UNDER THE GREAT GROVE OF STARS BENEATH THAT ARCH OF UNMOVED AND ETERNAL LIGHTS
TO REND HIM TO PIECES AND STREW HIM OVER THE STREETS HIS REMOVAL TO MAKE WAY FOR OTHER ACCUSED PERSONS WHO WERE TO BE TRIED RESCUED HIM FROM THESE CARESSES FOR THE MOMENT
BUT THE LIFE I LEAD MISS MANETTE IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO HEALTH WHAT IS TO BE EXPECTED OF OR BY SUCH PROFLIGATES IS IT NOT FORGIVE ME I HAVE BEGUN THE QUESTION ON MY LIPS A PITY TO LIVE NO BETTER LIFE
DON'T DO IT SAID MISTER CRUNCHES LOOKING ABOUT AS IF HE RATHER EXPECTED TO SEE THE LOAF DISAPPEAR UNDER THE EFFICACY OF HIS WIFE'S PETITIONS
SAY OF YOU MISS MANETTE AND ALTHOUGH I KNOW BETTER ALTHOUGH IN THE MYSTERY OF MY OWN WRETCHED HEART I KNOW BETTER I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT SHE WAS PALE AND TREMBLING
CONSOLATORY TO HER
DON'T SUFFER FOR ME A PARTING BLESSING FOR OUR CHILD I SEND IT TO HER BY YOU I KISS HER BY YOU I SAY FAREWELL TO HER BY YOU MY HUSBAND NO A MOMENT HE WAS TEARING HIMSELF APART FROM HER
IT WAS REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS THAT WHEN HE BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED HER FACE WITH HIS LIPS HE MURMURED SOME WORDS THE CHILD WHO WAS NEAREST TO HIM TOLD THEM AFTERWARDS AND TOLD HER GRANDCHILDREN WHEN SHE WAS A HANDSOME OLD LADY THAT SHE HEARD HIM SAY A LIFE YOU LOVE
AND HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS SAINT ANTOINE DEFARGE HAD DESCRIBED HIMSELF THAT DAY AS THE KEEPER OF A WINE SHOP IN THE SAINT ANTOINE SUBURB IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ONE WHO KNEW THE CITY WELL TO FIND HIS HOUSE WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTION
MIGHT HAVE KNOWN AS MUCH OF THEIR LANGUAGE AS OF HER OWN IF SHE HAD HAD A MIND SHE HAD NO MIND IN THAT DIRECTION CONSEQUENTLY SHE KNEW NO MORE OF THAT NONSENSE AS SHE WAS PLEASED TO CALL IT THAN MISTER CRUNCHER DID
TELL ME HOW AND WHY AM I AGAIN A PRISONER IT IS ENOUGH THAT YOU RETURN STRAIGHT TO THE CONCIERGERIE AND WILL KNOW TO MORROW YOU ARE SUMMONED FOR TO MORROW DOCTOR MANETTE WHOM THIS VISITATION HAD SO TURNED INTO STONE
WITH THE SECOND PREDOMINATING NO SOONER WAS THE ACQUITTAL PRONOUNCED THAN TEARS WERE SHED AS FREELY AS BLOOD AT ANOTHER TIME AND SUCH FRATERNAL EMBRACES WERE BESTOWED UPON THE PRISONER BY AS MANY OF BOTH SEXES AS COULD RUSH AT HIM
YES DEAREST CHARLES WITH HER HANDS ON HIS BREAST AND THE INQUIRING AND ATTENTIVE EXPRESSION FIXED UPON HIM WE ARE RATHER THOUGHTFUL TO NIGHT FOR WE HAVE SOMETHING ON OUR MIND TO NIGHT WHAT IS IT MY LUCIE
INSTANTLY MADAME DEFARGE'S KNIFE WAS IN HER GIRDLE THE DRUM WAS BEATING IN THE STREETS AS IF IT AND A DRUMMER HAD FLOWN TOGETHER BY MAGIC AND THE VENGEANCE UTTERING TERRIFIC SHRIEKS AND FLINGING HER ARMS ABOUT HER HEAD LIKE ALL THE FORTY FURIES AT ONCE
THEY SPOKE IN SUCH A TONE AS THEY WOULD HAVE USED IF THEY HAD BEEN WATCHING BY A SICK BED IN THE NIGHT CARTON STOOPED TO PICK UP THE COAT WHICH LAY ALMOST ENTANGLING HIS FEET
COME OUT AND LISTEN TO THE EVENING PAPER YOU INSIDE THERE CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY SO AT LAST BEGAN THE EVENING PAPER AT LA FORCE
THE LEAST GOOD IN THE WAY OF PREVENTION IT MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN WORTH REMARKING THAT THE FACT WAS EXACTLY THE REVERSE BUT IT CLEARED OFF AS TO THIS WORLD THE TROUBLE OF EACH PARTICULAR CASE AND LEFT NOTHING ELSE CONNECTED WITH IT TO BE LOOKED AFTER
BUT WHICH HE DID NOT DOUBT WOULD BE FOUND AMONG THE PAPERS THEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENT THE DOCTOR HAD TAKEN CARE THAT IT SHOULD BE THERE HAD ASSURED HIM THAT IT WOULD BE THERE
YET HE HAD SOME PLEASURE IN THE MERE SOUND OF HIS DAUGHTER'S VOICE AND INVARIABLY TURNED TO IT WHEN SHE SPOKE IN THE SUBMISSIVE WAY OF ONE LONG ACCUSTOMED TO OBEY UNDER COERCION HE ATE AND DRANK WHAT THEY GAVE HIM TO EAT AND DRINK AND PUT ON THE CLOAK AND OTHER WRAPPINGS THAT THEY GAVE HIM TO WEAR
BUT THE QUESTION DOCTOR MANETTE IS THERE IT WAS THE GOOD CREATURE'S WAY TO AFFECT TO MAKE LIGHT OF ANYTHING THAT WAS A GREAT ANXIETY WITH THEM ALL
THEY PASSED THROUGH THE INTERVENING STREETS AS QUICKLY AS THEY MIGHT ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE OF THE NEW DOMICILE WERE ADMITTED BY JERRY AND FOUND LUCIE WEEPING
BY MANY PASSAGES HAD NOT CEASED WHEN LUCIE STOOD STRETCHING OUT HER ARMS TOWARDS HER HUSBAND WITH NOTHING IN HER FACE BUT LOVE AND CONSOLATION IF I MIGHT TOUCH HIM IF I MIGHT EMBRACE HIM ONCE O GOOD CITIZENS IF YOU WOULD HAVE SO MUCH COMPASSION FOR US
AFTER GRASPING THE DOCTOR'S HAND AS HE STOOD VICTORIOUS AND PROUD BEFORE HIM AFTER GRASPING THE HAND OF MISTER LORRY
I KNOW HOW HARD IT HAS GROWN FOR ME THE WEARER OF THIS TO SUPPORT LIFE IN MYSELF BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT HAS GROWN FOR ME THE WEARER OF THIS TO DESTROY LIFE IN YOU EVERY LEAN BARE ARM THAT HAD BEEN WITHOUT WORK BEFORE
SAY THEN MY HUSBAND WHAT IS IT NEWS FROM THE OTHER WORLD HOW THEN CRIED MADAME CONTEMPTUOUSLY THE OTHER WORLD
GOD BLESS YOU HE PUT HER HAND TO HIS LIPS AND MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION MISS MANETTE OF MY EVER RESUMING THIS CONVERSATION BY SO MUCH AS A PASSING WORD I WILL NEVER REFER TO IT AGAIN
AND JERRY ALMOST WHOLLY TRANSFERRED TO THEM BY MISTER LORRY HAD BECOME THEIR DAILY RETAINER AND HAD HIS BED THERE EVERY NIGHT IT WAS AN ORDINANCE OF THE REPUBLIC ONE AND INDIVISIBLE OF LIBERTY EQUALITY FRATERNITY OR DEATH
AND WHO DIED AND WENT TO HELL EVERYBODY FROM ALL THROATS THE NEWS IS OF HIM HE IS AMONG US AMONG US FROM THE UNIVERSAL THROAT AGAIN AND DEAD NOT DEAD HE FEARED US SO MUCH AND WITH REASON
AND CLOSED THE DOOR COURAGE MY DEAR LUCIE SAID MISTER LORRY AS HE RAISED HER COURAGE COURAGE SO FAR ALL GOES WELL WITH US
IN BOTH THERE WERE SEVERAL KNOTS OF LOUNGERS SQUALID AND MISERABLE BUT NOW WITH A MANIFEST SENSE OF POWER ENTHRONED ON THEIR DISTRESS THE RAGGEDEST NIGHTCAP AWRY ON THE WRETCHEDEST HEAD HAD THIS CROOKED SIGNIFICANCE IN IT
YES I COME FROM DOCTOR MANETTE AND WHAT SAYS HE WHAT DOES HE SEND ME
MOVED AFTER THESE WORDS WERE SPOKEN PUT THE LAMP DOWN AND CONFRONTING THE SPEAKER AND TAKING HIM NOT UNGENTLY BY THE LOOSE FRONT OF HIS RED WOOLLEN SHIRT SAID YOU KNOW HIM YOU HAVE SAID DO YOU KNOW ME YES I KNOW YOU CITIZEN DOCTOR
AT MONSIEUR WITH THE WHITE HEAD IT IS WELL FORWARD
ILLUMINATED COFFEE HOUSES AND THEATRE DOORS TO ONE OF THE CITY GATES SOLDIERS WITH LANTERNS AT THE GUARD HOUSE THERE YOUR PAPERS TRAVELLERS SEE HERE THEN MONSIEUR THE OFFICER SAID DEFARGE GETTING DOWN AND TAKING HIM GRAVELY APART
JUDGE YOU IS IT LIKELY THAT THE TROUBLE OF ONE WIFE AND MOTHER WOULD BE MUCH TO US NOW SHE RESUMED HER KNITTING AND WENT OUT THE VENGEANCE FOLLOWED
CARTON TOOK IT UP AND THERE WAS A FOLDED PAPER IN IT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THIS HE SAID MISTER LORRY NODDED HIS CONSENT HE OPENED IT AND EXCLAIMED THANK GOD WHAT IS IT ASKED MISTER LORRY EAGERLY
DEFARGE IS AN ENGLISH LADY AND KNOWS NO FRENCH THE LADY IN QUESTION WHOSE ROOTED CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR ANY FOREIGNER WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN BY DISTRESS AND DANGER APPEARED WITH FOLDED ARMS
GOD BLESS YOU FOR YOUR SWEET COMPASSION
IN WINDING AND TRAMPING THROUGH THEM AS THEY HAD REDDENED THEM BELOW THE SNOW WITH A DEEPER DYE THEY CARRIED HIM THUS INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE BUILDING WHERE HE LIVED HER FATHER HAD GONE ON BEFORE TO PREPARE HER
HAD BEEN A WITNESS ON THAT ENGLISH TRIAL AND COULD CORROBORATE HIS ACCOUNT OF IT THE JURY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD HEARD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY WERE READY WITH THEIR VOTES IF THE PRESIDENT WERE CONTENT TO RECEIVE THEM AT EVERY VOTE
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US IF THOSE SHOES ARE NOT DONE TO NIGHT LOST UTTERLY LOST IT WAS SO CLEARLY BEYOND HOPE TO REASON WITH HIM OR TRY TO RESTORE HIM THAT AS IF BY AGREEMENT THEY EACH PUT A HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
AND WENT KNITTING OUT OF THE LAMPLIGHT THROUGH THE COURTYARD SHE QUICKLY BROUGHT THEM DOWN AND HANDED THEM IN AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR POST KNITTING AND SAW NOTHING DEFARGE GOT UPON THE BOX AND GAVE THE WORD TO THE BARRIER
BEGINNING TO BE STRUCK BY DEFARGE'S MANNER MISTER LORRY LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIM AND LED THE WAY BOTH THE WOMEN FOLLOWED THE SECOND WOMAN BEING THE VENGEANCE
IF ONE FORLORN WANDERER THEN PACING THE DARK STREETS COULD HAVE HEARD HER INNOCENT DISCLOSURE AND COULD HAVE SEEN THE DROPS OF PITY KISSED AWAY BY HER HUSBAND FROM THE SOFT BLUE EYES SO LOVING OF THAT HUSBAND HE MIGHT HAVE CRIED TO THE NIGHT
BUT THE UNSTEADY FINGERS OF ONE OF HIS HANDS STRAYED TO HIS LIPS AS HE LOOKED AT IT HIS LIPS AND HIS NAILS WERE OF THE SAME PALE LEAD COLOUR AND THEN THE HAND DROPPED TO HIS WORK AND HE ONCE MORE BENT OVER THE SHOE THE LOOK AND THE ACTION HAD OCCUPIED BUT AN INSTANT
EXTERMINATION IS GOOD DOCTRINE MY WIFE SAID DEFARGE RATHER TROUBLED IN GENERAL I SAY NOTHING AGAINST IT BUT THIS DOCTOR HAS SUFFERED MUCH YOU HAVE SEEN HIM TO DAY YOU HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE WHEN THE PAPER WAS READ
DON'T SAY THAT MISS MANETTE FOR YOU WOULD HAVE RECLAIMED ME IF ANYTHING COULD YOU WILL NOT BE THE CAUSE OF MY BECOMING WORSE SINCE THE STATE OF YOUR MIND THAT YOU DESCRIBE IS AT ALL EVENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SOME INFLUENCE OF MINE
IT IS GOOD UNTIL RECALLED BUT IT MAY BE SOON RECALLED AND I HAVE REASON TO THINK WILL BE THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER THEY ARE IN GREAT DANGER THEY ARE IN DANGER OF DENUNCIATION BY MADAME DEFARGE
AND HE THOUGHT OF FINDING OUT THE WINE SHOP AGAIN AND TAKING COUNSEL WITH ITS MASTER IN REFERENCE TO THE SAFEST DWELLING PLACE IN THE DISTRACTED STATE OF THE CITY BUT THE SAME CONSIDERATION THAT SUGGESTED HIM
AT THE APPOINTED HOUR HE EMERGED FROM IT TO PRESENT HIMSELF IN MISTER LORRY'S ROOM AGAIN WHERE HE FOUND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WALKING TO AND FRO IN RESTLESS ANXIETY HE SAID HE HAD BEEN WITH LUCIE UNTIL JUST NOW
GIVING THEM WHAT COMFORT HE COULD AND MUCH MORE THAN HE HAD HIMSELF HE LEFT JERRY WITH THEM AS A FIGURE TO FILL A DOORWAY THAT WOULD BEAR CONSIDERABLE KNOCKING ON THE HEAD AND RETAINED TO HIS OWN OCCUPATIONS
WHEREAS IN ENGLAND HE LIVED BY GIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE HE HAD RETURNED WHEN HE DID ON THE PRESSING AND WRITTEN ENTREATY OF A FRENCH CITIZEN WHO REPRESENTED THAT HIS LIFE WAS ENDANGERED BY HIS ABSENCE
THESE JUDGES AND ALL THE MEN IN POWER ARE VERY FRIENDLY TO YOU AND VERY RECOGNISANT OF YOUR SERVICES ARE THEY NOT NOTHING CONNECTED WITH CHARLES WAS CONCEALED FROM ME I HAD THE STRONGEST ASSURANCES THAT I SHOULD SAVE HIM AND I DID
AND POINTING HER KNITTING NEEDLE AT LITTLE LUCIE AS IF IT WERE THE FINGER OF FATE
AS THAT BASTILLE PAPER DESCRIBES IS MY FAMILY DEFARGE THAT SISTER OF THE MORTALLY WOUNDED BOY UPON THE GROUND WAS MY SISTER THAT HUSBAND WAS MY SISTER'S HUSBAND THAT UNBORN CHILD WAS THEIR CHILD
AS A STATEMENT OF ITS JUST PRICE ONE FINGER LESS THAN THE MERCHANT HELD UP WHATEVER HIS NUMBER MIGHT BE NOW MISTER CRUNCHER SAID MISS PROSS WHOSE EYES WERE RED WITH FELICITY IF YOU ARE READY I AM JERRY HOARSELY PROFESSED HIMSELF AT MISS PROSS'S SERVICE
THEY KEPT HIM IN A DARK PLACE LIKE A CHEESE UNTIL HE HAD THE FULL TELLSON FLAVOUR AND BLUE MOULD UPON HIM THEN ONLY WAS HE PERMITTED TO BE SEEN
THAT THEY MIGHT SEE NOW A LOG OF DEAD WOOD DRAWN THROUGH A FOREST OF LEGS HE WAS HAULED TO THE NEAREST STREET CORNER WHERE ONE OF THE FATAL LAMPS SWUNG AND THERE MADAME DEFARGE LET HIM GO AS A CAT MIGHT HAVE DONE TO A MOUSE
MISTER CRUNCHER HIMSELF ALWAYS SPOKE OF THE YEAR OF OUR LORD AS ANNA DOMINOES APPARENTLY UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE CHRISTIAN ERA DATED FROM THE INVENTION OF A POPULAR GAME BY A LADY WHO HAD BESTOWED HER NAME UPON IT
MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN IT HAS OF LATE GONE WITH MANY POOR SOULS CHEER UP AND HAVE A THANKFUL HEART I AM NOT THANKLESS I HOPE
I HAVE HAD A PATTERN IN MY HAND HE GLANCED AT THE SHOE WITH SOME LITTLE PASSING TOUCH OF PRIDE AND THE MAKER'S NAME SAID DEFARGE NOW THAT HE HAD NO WORK TO HOLD HE LAID THE KNUCKLES OF THE RIGHT HAND IN THE HOLLOW OF THE LEFT
IS AN ENGLISH LADY AND KNOWS NO FRENCH THE LADY IN QUESTION WHOSE ROOTED CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR ANY FOREIGNER WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN BY DISTRESS AND DANGER APPEARED WITH FOLDED ARMS AND OBSERVED IN ENGLISH
SAID MISS PROSS CHEERFULLY REPRESSING A SIGH AS SHE GLANCED AT HER DARLING'S GOLDEN HAIR IN THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE THEN WE MUST HAVE PATIENCE AND WAIT THAT'S ALL WE MUST HOLD UP OUR HEADS AND FIGHT LOW AS MY BROTHER SOLOMON USED TO SAY NOW MISTER CRUNCHER
ANSWERED DARNAY I SEEK HIM WE SEEK HIM I KNOW YOU EVREMONDE I SAW YOU BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL TO DAY YOU ARE AGAIN THE PRISONER OF THE REPUBLIC THE FOUR SURROUNDED HIM WHERE HE STOOD WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILD CLINGING TO HIM
AND OFTEN WHEN HE HAD THROWN HIMSELF UPON IT NO LONGER THAN A FEW MINUTES HE HAD GOT UP AGAIN AND HAUNTED THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD
AFTER NOTIFYING TO HIS JACKAL THAT HE HAD THOUGHT BETTER OF THAT MARRYING MATTER HAD CARRIED HIS DELICACY INTO DEVONSHIRE AND WHEN THE SIGHT AND SCENT OF FLOWERS IN THE CITY STREETS HAD SOME WAIFS OF GOODNESS IN THEM FOR THE WORST
BREAD AND MEAT WINE AND HOT COFFEE
ALL WELL WITH CHARLES AND HE WERE TO BE RELEASED HE COULD NOT HOPE TO LEAVE THE CITY MISTER LORRY WENT OUT IN QUEST OF SUCH A LODGING AND FOUND A SUITABLE ONE HIGH UP IN A REMOVED BY STREET
WITH MARVELLOUS QUICKNESS AT A DISTANCE THE MORE READILY BECAUSE CERTAIN MEN WHO HAD BY SOME WONDERFUL EXERCISE OF AGILITY CLIMBED UP THE EXTERNAL ARCHITECTURE TO LOOK IN FROM THE WINDOWS KNEW MADAME DEFARGE WELL AND ACTED AS A TELEGRAPH BETWEEN HER AND THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE BUILDING
LISTEN EVERYWHERE SAID MADAME AGAIN LISTEN TO HIM DEFARGE STOOD PANTING AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF EAGER EYES AND OPEN MOUTHS FORMED OUTSIDE THE DOOR ALL THOSE WITHIN THE WINE SHOP HAD SPRUNG TO THEIR FEET
AT FIRST HIS MIND REVERTED TO DEFARGE AND HE THOUGHT OF FINDING OUT THE WINE SHOP AGAIN AND TAKING COUNSEL WITH ITS MASTER IN REFERENCE TO THE SAFEST DWELLING PLACE IN THE DISTRACTED STATE OF THE CITY
AND YET I HAVE HAD THE WEAKNESS AND HAVE STILL THE WEAKNESS TO WISH YOU TO KNOW WITH WHAT A SUDDEN MASTERY YOU KINDLED ME HEAP OF ASHES THAT I AM INTO FIRE A FIRE HOWEVER INSEPARABLE IN ITS NATURE FROM MYSELF
BOOK THE SECOND THE GOLDEN THREAD
LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THE FIVE HAD HAD IT IS TRUE NO AUDIENCE TO LENGTHEN THEIR PROCEEDINGS FOR WHEN HE AND DOCTOR MANETTE EMERGED FROM THE GATE THERE WAS A GREAT CROWD ABOUT IT
HIS OWN POSSESSIONS SAFETY LIFE HE WOULD HAVE HAZARDED FOR LUCIE AND HER CHILD WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DEMUR BUT THE GREAT TRUST HE HELD WAS NOT HIS OWN AND AS TO THAT BUSINESS CHARGE HE WAS A STRICT MAN OF BUSINESS
AN UNNATURAL SILENCE AND DESERTION REIGNED THERE ONLY ONE SOUL WAS TO BE SEEN AND THAT WAS MADAME DEFARGE WHO LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR POST KNITTING AND SAW NOTHING
IT CAN'T BE SEE WHAT THE PRISONER IS THESE ARE NOT THE HANDS SHE KNEW THIS IS NOT THE FACE SHE KNEW THIS IS NOT A VOICE SHE EVER HEARD NO NO SHE WAS AND HE WAS BEFORE THE SLOW YEARS OF THE NORTH TOWER
WILL SUBMIT HIMSELF TO HER DO YOU NOT I AM SURE OF IT I THOUGHT SO QUIETLY AND STEADILY HAVE ALL THESE ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN THE COURTYARD HERE EVEN TO THE TAKING OF YOUR OWN SEAT IN THE CARRIAGE
BUT WHAT HE MOST NOTICED IN THE TWO FIGURES WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE POSTED AS CLOSE TO HIMSELF AS THEY COULD BE THEY NEVER LOOKED TOWARDS HIM THEY SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR SOMETHING WITH A DOGGED DETERMINATION
BUT I WISH YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU INSPIRED IT WILL NOTHING OF IT REMAIN O MISTER CARTON THINK AGAIN TRY AGAIN NO MISS MANETTE ALL THROUGH IT I HAVE KNOWN MYSELF TO BE QUITE UNDESERVING
HE WAS SO UNLIKE WHAT HE HAD EVER SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE AND IT WAS SO SAD TO THINK HOW MUCH HE HAD THROWN AWAY AND HOW MUCH HE EVERY DAY KEPT DOWN AND PERVERTED
YOU WILL DO HIM NO HARM YOU WILL HELP ME TO SEE HIM IF YOU CAN YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT MY BUSINESS HERE RETURNED MADAME DEFARGE LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE IT IS THE DAUGHTER OF YOUR FATHER WHO IS MY BUSINESS HERE
THAT THE TWO BEHOLDERS COVERED THEIR FACES
YOU WILL HELP ME TO SEE HIM IF YOU CAN YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT MY BUSINESS HERE RETURNED MADAME DEFARGE LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE IT IS THE DAUGHTER OF YOUR FATHER WHO IS MY BUSINESS HERE
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN ITS TOUCH THAT GAVE LUCIE A CHECK SHE STOPPED IN THE ACT OF PUTTING THE NOTE IN HER BOSOM AND WITH HER HANDS YET AT HER NECK LOOKED TERRIFIED AT MADAME DEFARGE
AND THEY LOOKED AT THE JURY BUT AT NOTHING ELSE UNDER THE PRESIDENT SAT DOCTOR MANETTE IN HIS USUAL QUIET DRESS AS WELL AS THE PRISONER COULD SEE HE AND MISTER LORRY WERE THE ONLY MEN THERE UNCONNECTED WITH THE TRIBUNAL
AS A FIGURE TO FILL A DOORWAY THAT WOULD BEAR CONSIDERABLE KNOCKING ON THE HEAD AND RETAINED TO HIS OWN OCCUPATIONS A DISTURBED AND DOLEFUL MIND HE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON THEM AND SLOWLY AND HEAVILY THE DAY LAGGED ON WITH HIM
IT IS EASY TO FORESEE THAT THE PRETENCE WILL BE THE COMMON ONE A PRISON PLOT AND THAT IT WILL INVOLVE HER LIFE AND PERHAPS HER CHILD'S AND PERHAPS HER FATHER'S FOR BOTH HAVE BEEN SEEN WITH HER AT THAT PLACE DON'T LOOK SO HORRIFIED YOU WILL SAVE THEM ALL
HE HAD GRADUALLY DROPPED TO THE FLOOR AND LAY THERE IN A LETHARGY WORN OUT SHE HAD NESTLED DOWN WITH HIM THAT HIS HEAD MIGHT LIE UPON HER ARM AND HER HAIR DROOPING OVER HIM CURTAINED HIM FROM THE LIGHT
OR SNOOKS BROTHERS MIGHT BUT TELLSON'S THANK HEAVEN ANY ONE OF THESE PARTNERS WOULD HAVE DISINHERITED HIS SON ON THE QUESTION OF REBUILDING TELLSON'S IN THIS RESPECT THE HOUSE WAS MUCH ON A PAR WITH THE COUNTRY
BUT LOOKING UP AT HIS FACE IN THE INTERCHANGE OF THE FIRST FEW COMMON PLACES SHE OBSERVED A CHANGE IN IT I FEAR YOU ARE NOT WELL MISTER CARTON NO
MISTER LORRY HELD IT OPEN IN HIS HAND GAZING IN HIS EARNEST FACE KEEP IT FOR ME UNTIL TO MORROW I SHALL SEE HIM TO MORROW YOU REMEMBER AND I HAD BETTER NOT TAKE IT INTO THE PRISON WHY NOT I DON'T KNOW I PREFER NOT TO DO SO
BY THE SURRENDER OF THE CITIZEN EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY DOCTOR MANETTE WAS NEXT QUESTIONED HIS HIGH PERSONAL POPULARITY AND THE CLEARNESS OF HIS ANSWERS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION
HE KNOWS THAT A WOOD SAWYER LIVING BY THE PRISON WALL IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE DEFARGES AND HAS BEEN REHEARSED BY MADAME DEFARGE AS TO HIS HAVING SEEN HER HE NEVER MENTIONED LUCIE'S NAME MAKING SIGNS AND SIGNALS TO PRISONERS
HE TOOK THE SHOE UP AND RESUMED HIS WORK HAVE YOU RECOGNISED HIM MONSIEUR ASKED DEFARGE IN A WHISPER YES FOR A MOMENT AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT QUITE HOPELESS
WHEN HE HAD GONE OUT INTO THE NEXT ROOM HE TURNED SUDDENLY ON MISTER LORRY AND HER FATHER WHO WERE FOLLOWING AND SAID TO THE LATTER YOU HAD GREAT INFLUENCE BUT YESTERDAY DOCTOR MANETTE LET IT AT LEAST BE TRIED
WHERE IS MY BENCH I HAVE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR MY BENCH AND I CAN'T FIND IT WHAT HAVE THEY DONE WITH MY WORK TIME PRESSES I MUST FINISH THOSE SHOES THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND THEIR HEARTS DIED WITHIN THEM COME
AND HE BENT OVER HIS WORK IT HAPPENED AT LENGTH THAT HE HAD OCCASION TO CHANGE THE INSTRUMENT IN HIS HAND FOR HIS SHOEMAKER'S KNIFE
GOOD SAID HE I'LL HAVE SOME SUPPER BUT ON SMELLING THEM HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE ODOURLESS NO CHANCE THERE THOUGHT HE THE WORTHY FELLOW HAD CERTAINLY TAKEN GOOD CARE TO EAT AS HEARTY A BREAKFAST AS POSSIBLE BEFORE LEAVING THE CARNATIC
NOT ON BUSHES BUT ON TREES AND WITHIN BAMBOO ENCLOSURES CHERRY PLUM AND APPLE TREES WHICH THE JAPANESE CULTIVATE RATHER FOR THEIR BLOSSOMS THAN THEIR FRUIT AND WHICH QUEERLY FASHIONED GRINNING SCARECROWS PROTECTED FROM THE SPARROWS PIGEONS RAVENS AND OTHER VORACIOUS BIRDS
FINDING MYSELF OUT OF PLACE AND HEARING THAT MONSIEUR PHILEAS FOGG WAS THE MOST EXACT
BERTHS WERE SUDDENLY IMPROVISED AND EACH TRAVELLER HAD SOON AT HIS DISPOSITION A COMFORTABLE BED PROTECTED FROM CURIOUS EYES BY THICK CURTAINS THE SHEETS WERE CLEAN AND THE PILLOWS SOFT
ON THE POINT OF STARTING PASSEPARTOUT HAD BUT FEW STEPS TO GO AND RUSHING UPON THE PLANK HE CROSSED IT AND FELL UNCONSCIOUS ON THE DECK JUST AS THE CARNATIC WAS MOVING OFF
EVEN AT THE ANTIPODES IT IS CONVENIENT TO HAVE SOME MONEY IN ONE'S POCKET THE CARNATIC SETTING SAIL FROM HONG KONG AT HALF PAST SIX ON THE SEVENTH OF NOVEMBER DIRECTED HER COURSE AT FULL STEAM TOWARDS JAPAN
WITH ALL STEAM ON AND THE STEAM WAS ABOUT TO GIVE OUT ALTOGETHER SIR SAID CAPTAIN SPEEDY WHO WAS NOW DEEPLY INTERESTED IN MISTER FOGG'S PROJECT I REALLY COMMISERATE YOU EVERYTHING IS AGAINST YOU
AND I AM ANDREW SPEEDY OF CARDIFF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT TO SEA IN AN HOUR YOU ARE BOUND FOR BORDEAUX AND YOUR CARGO NO FREIGHT
WHY THE CAPTAIN WAS A PRISONER IN HIS CABIN AND WHY IN SHORT THE HENRIETTA WAS DIRECTING HER COURSE TOWARDS LIVERPOOL IT WAS VERY CLEAR TO SEE MISTER FOGG MANAGE THE CRAFT THAT HE HAD BEEN A SAILOR HOW THE ADVENTURE ENDED WILL BE SEEN ANON
THERE WOULD BE TIME FOR THE WARRANT TO ARRIVE AND FORTUNE AT LAST FAVOURED THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LAW HIS HORROR MAY BE IMAGINED WHEN HE HEARD MISTER FOGG SAY IN HIS PLACID VOICE
FIX'S REVELATION AND THE OPIUM HOUSE
ITS GRADE EVEN ON THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS NEVER EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE FEET TO THE MILE SUCH WAS THE ROAD TO BE TRAVERSED IN SEVEN DAYS WHICH WOULD ENABLE PHILEAS FOGG AT LEAST SO HE HOPED
IS YOUR VESSEL A SWIFT ONE BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE KNOTS THE HENRIETTA WELL KNOWN WILL YOU CARRY ME AND THREE OTHER PERSONS TO LIVERPOOL TO LIVERPOOL
HIS MASTER'S LAST EXPLOIT THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH HE IGNORED ENCHANTED HIM NEVER HAD THE CREW SEEN SO JOLLY AND DEXTEROUS A FELLOW HE FORMED WARM FRIENDSHIPS WITH THE SAILORS AND AMAZED THEM WITH HIS ACROBATIC FEATS HE THOUGHT THEY MANAGED THE VESSEL LIKE GENTLEMEN
WAS NOT GOING TO LIVERPOOL AT ALL BUT TO SOME PART OF THE WORLD WHERE THE ROBBER TURNED INTO A PIRATE WOULD QUIETLY PUT HIMSELF IN SAFETY THE CONJECTURE WAS AT LEAST A PLAUSIBLE ONE AND THE DETECTIVE BEGAN TO SERIOUSLY REGRET THAT HE HAD EMBARKED ON THE AFFAIR
EVER SINCE THE EVENING BEFORE THE BAROMETER SUDDENLY FALLING HAD INDICATED AN APPROACHING CHANGE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND DURING THE NIGHT THE TEMPERATURE VARIED THE COLD BECAME SHARPER AND THE WIND VEERED TO THE SOUTH EAST THIS WAS A MISFORTUNE MISTER FOGG IN ORDER NOT TO DEVIATE FROM HIS COURSE
REPLIED MISTER FOGG KEEP THEM UP TO THE LAST LET THE VALVES BE FILLED TOWARDS NOON PHILEAS FOGG HAVING ASCERTAINED THEIR POSITION CALLED PASSEPARTOUT AND ORDERED HIM TO GO FOR CAPTAIN SPEEDY
MINGLED ITS SHRIEKS AND BELLOWINGS WITH THE NOISE OF TORRENTS AND CASCADES AND TWINED ITS SMOKE AMONG THE BRANCHES OF THE GIGANTIC PINES THERE WERE FEW OR NO BRIDGES OR TUNNELS ON THE ROUTE
CHAPTER NINE IN WHICH THE RED SEA AND THE INDIAN OCEAN PROVE PROPITIOUS TO THE
BUT THE FRENCHMAN DID NOT APPEAR AND WITHOUT DOUBT WAS STILL LYING UNDER THE STUPEFYING INFLUENCE OF THE OPIUM
MISTER FOGG THEN LEARNED THAT THE CARNATIC HAD SAILED THE EVENING BEFORE HE HAD EXPECTED TO FIND NOT ONLY THE STEAMER BUT HIS DOMESTIC AND WAS FORCED TO GIVE UP BOTH BUT NO SIGN OF DISAPPOINTMENT APPEARED ON HIS FACE AND HE MERELY REMARKED TO AOUDA
ADMINISTERED TO HIMSELF A SOUND LECTURE FOR HIS GREENNESS I HAVE BEEN AN IDIOT HE THOUGHT AND THIS MAN WILL SEE IT
AND VILLAGES WHICH ALONG ITS BORDERS RAISED THEIR
AND LEFT A SUM OF MONEY TO BE SPENT IN THE SEARCH FOR HIM THE SAME FORMALITIES HAVING BEEN GONE THROUGH AT THE FRENCH CONSULATE AND THE PALANQUIN HAVING STOPPED AT THE HOTEL FOR THE LUGGAGE WHICH HAD BEEN SENT BACK THERE THEY RETURNED TO THE WHARF
ONCE A MAN APPROACHED AND SPOKE TO HIM AND THE DETECTIVE MERELY REPLIED BY SHAKING HIS HEAD THUS THE NIGHT PASSED AT DAWN THE HALF EXTINGUISHED DISC OF THE SUN ROSE ABOVE A MISTY HORIZON
THE SAILOR LEANED ON THE RAILING OPENED HIS EYES WIDE AND SAID IS YOUR HONOUR JOKING
CHAPTER THIRTY IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SIMPLY DOES HIS DUTY THREE PASSENGERS INCLUDING PASSEPARTOUT HAD DISAPPEARED HAD THEY BEEN KILLED IN THE STRUGGLE
CONGENIAL TO HIS TASTES PHILEAS FOGG WAS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE EITHER WIFE OR CHILDREN WHICH MAY HAPPEN TO THE MOST HONEST PEOPLE EITHER RELATIVES
WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO WAIT UNTIL MISTER FOGG REACHED LONDON AGAIN
BUT HE COULD NOT DOUBT HOW THE YOUNG WOMAN WOULD RECEIVE HIS CONFIDENCES WHAT COURSE SHOULD HE TAKE
FIX WAS SLIGHTLY WOUNDED IN THE ARM
I COULD NOT RISK MYSELF MY MEN OR MY LITTLE BOAT OF SCARCELY TWENTY TONS ON SO LONG A VOYAGE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR BESIDES
I'LL ANSWER FOR IT HE'LL NOT SLIP THROUGH MY FINGERS I HOPE SO MISTER FIX
I AM SORRY SAID THE SAILOR BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE I OFFER YOU A HUNDRED POUNDS PER DAY AND AN ADDITIONAL REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS IF I REACH YOKOHAMA IN TIME
SIGNALLED UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THE SIXTH THE STEAMER WAS DUE ON THE FIFTH PHILEAS FOGG WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEHIND HAND AND THE YOKOHAMA STEAMER WOULD OF COURSE BE MISSED
COULD HE HAVE GONE ON BOARD THE CARNATIC WITHOUT US WITHOUT YOU MADAM ANSWERED THE DETECTIVE EXCUSE ME DID YOU INTEND TO SAIL IN THE CARNATIC YES SIR
INTO OBEDIENCE POOR FELLOW FIX CAREFULLY CONCEALED FROM HIM HIS OWN SATISFACTION FOR HAD HE BETRAYED IT
BUT WITH NO PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT FOR NEITHER SHAKING NOR MALEDICTIONS COULD PREVAIL UPON IT TO CHANGE ITS MIND ON THE FOURTH HOWEVER THE SEA BECAME MORE CALM
BUT HE DID NOT TALK TO HIM AFTER RECENT EVENTS THEIR RELATIONS WITH EACH OTHER HAD GROWN SOMEWHAT COLD THERE COULD NO LONGER BE MUTUAL SYMPATHY OR INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM
AND BEGAN TO STUDY HIS SITUATION IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT AN ENVIABLE ONE HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO JAPAN
HAD HE BEEN CAPABLE OF BEING ASTONISHED AT ANYTHING
THEN YOU KNOW INDIA WHY YES REPLIED FIX WHO SPOKE CAUTIOUSLY A CURIOUS PLACE THIS INDIA
AND GENERALS OF DIVISIONS FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS WHAT WITH THE MILITARY MEN A NUMBER OF RICH YOUNG ENGLISHMEN ON THEIR TRAVELS AND THE HOSPITABLE EFFORTS OF THE PURSER
HE KEPT CRYING OUT THE CARNATIC THE CARNATIC
INSECTS PHILEAS FOGG WAS A MEMBER OF THE REFORM AND THAT WAS ALL THE WAY IN WHICH HE GOT ADMISSION TO THIS EXCLUSIVE CLUB WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH HE WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE BARINGS WITH WHOM HE HAD AN OPEN CREDIT
CHAPTER TWENTY SIX IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PARTY TRAVEL BY THE PACIFIC RAILROAD FROM OCEAN TO OCEAN SO SAY THE AMERICANS
FOR IN THIS IMMENSE AND ADMIRABLE PORT THERE IS NOT ONE DAY IN A HUNDRED THAT VESSELS DO NOT SET OUT FOR EVERY QUARTER OF THE GLOBE BUT THEY WERE MOSTLY SAILING VESSELS OF WHICH OF COURSE PHILEAS FOGG COULD MAKE NO USE
HE BEGAN TO COLLECT HIS SENSE WHICH HE FOUND A DIFFICULT TASK
THE BUZZING OF THE OVER HEATED BOILER WAS HEARD AND THE STEAM WAS ESCAPING FROM THE VALVES THE ENGINEER WHISTLED THE TRAIN STARTED AND SOON DISAPPEARED MINGLING ITS WHITE SMOKE WITH THE EDDIES OF THE DENSELY FALLING SNOW
MY FRIENDS I WILL DIVIDE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AMONG YOU IF WE SAVE THE PRISONERS IT WAS THEN A LITTLE PAST NOON AOUDA RETIRED TO A WAITING ROOM AND THERE SHE WAITED ALONE THINKING OF THE SIMPLE AND NOBLE GENEROSITY
HUNG TO THEIR WAISTS SOLDIERS CLAD IN BLUE COTTON WITH WHITE STRIPES AND BEARING GUNS THE MIKADO'S GUARDS
THE DETECTIVE WAS EVIDENTLY INSPIRED BY THE HOPE OF OBTAINING THE SPLENDID REWARD WHICH WOULD BE THE PRIZE OF SUCCESS AND AWAITED WITH A FEVERISH IMPATIENCE
THANKS SIR I WAS ABOUT TO ASK THE FAVOUR VERY WELL IN HALF AN HOUR WE SHALL GO ON BOARD
OF COURSE ASS REPLIED THE DETECTIVE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND TURNING ON HIS HEEL
PASSED NORTHWARD FOR SEVERAL MILES BY ITS BANKS THEN IT TURNED EASTWARD AND KEPT BY THE RIVER UNTIL IT REACHED THE HUMBOLDT RANGE
WHEN HE COUNTED UP THE SUMS EXPENDED IN PURE LOSS AND ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT THE IMMENSE STAKE ADDED TO THE HEAVY CHARGES OF THIS USELESS JOURNEY WOULD COMPLETELY RUIN MISTER FOGG
INDEFATIGABLY FOR HE HAD FOUND PARTNERS AS ENTHUSIASTIC IN THE GAME AS HIMSELF
I HAVE COME TO MONSIEUR IN THE HOPE OF LIVING WITH HIM A TRANQUIL LIFE AND FORGETTING EVEN THE NAME OF
JUST SO MONSIEUR FIX
HE ACQUITTED HIS TASK WITH CHARACTERISTIC SERENITY AND INVARIABLY REPLIED TO THE REMONSTRANCES OF HIS FAIR COMPANION WHO WAS CONFUSED BY HIS PATIENCE AND GENEROSITY IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF MY JOURNEY A PART OF MY PROGRAMME
WHICH SWARM IN THE ENGLISH CAPITAL FROM THE HARMONIC TO THAT OF THE ENTOMOLOGISTS FOUNDED MAINLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ABOLISHING
FIX DID NOT LOOK AT THE STATE OF THINGS IN THE SAME LIGHT THE STORM GREATLY PLEASED HIM HIS SATISFACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETE HAD THE RANGOON BEEN FORCED TO RETREAT
THE TANKADERE WAS A NEAT LITTLE CRAFT OF TWENTY TONS AS GRACEFULLY BUILT AS IF SHE WERE A RACING YACHT HER SHINING COPPER SHEATHING HER GALVANISED IRON WORK HER DECK WHITE AS IVORY
AND HIS BET WOULD BE CERTAINLY LOST BUT AS HE THOUGHT IT IS MY DUTY HE DID NOT HESITATE THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF FORT KEARNEY WAS THERE A HUNDRED OF HIS SOLDIERS HAD PLACED THEMSELVES IN A POSITION
WHAT THIS MAN WHOM HE HAD JUST FOLLOWED AROUND THE WORLD WAS PERMITTED NOW TO SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM HIM
AND WAS NOW RISKING HIS LIFE ALL WITHOUT HESITATION FROM DUTY IN SILENCE FIX DID NOT HAVE THE SAME THOUGHTS AND COULD SCARCELY CONCEAL HIS AGITATION HE WALKED FEVERISHLY UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM
THE CAPTAIN SPOKE IN A TONE WHICH DID NOT ADMIT OF A REPLY BUT THE OWNERS OF THE HENRIETTA RESUMED PHILEAS FOGG THE OWNERS ARE MYSELF REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
BEING RESERVED AS A FUND FOR HIS CHARITIES MISTER FOGG PLAYED NOT TO WIN BUT FOR THE SAKE OF PLAYING THE GAME WAS IN HIS EYES A CONTEST
IN THE WORLD QUITE WELL AND I TOO
A SORT OF TEMPEST AROSE ON THE THIRD OF NOVEMBER
IT WAS AS IF THE HONEST FELLOW HAD BEEN COMMANDED TO UNCHAIN A TIGER HE WENT TO THE POOP SAYING TO HIMSELF HE WILL BE LIKE A MADMAN IN A FEW MOMENTS WITH CRIES AND OATHS A BOMB APPEARED ON THE POOP DECK THE BOMB WAS CAPTAIN SPEEDY
AND TO POSTPONE THE MEAL HE CRAVED TILL THE FOLLOWING MORNING NIGHT CAME
AND THE ORIENTAL ISLANDS PUT IN IT IS SITUATED IN THE BAY OF YEDDO AND AT BUT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THAT SECOND CAPITAL OF THE JAPANESE EMPIRE AND THE RESIDENCE OF THE TYCOON THE CIVIL EMPEROR BEFORE THE MIKADO THE SPIRITUAL EMPEROR ABSORBED HIS OFFICE IN HIS OWN THE CARNATIC
BLEW A GALE AND RETARDED THE STEAMER THE RANGOON ROLLED HEAVILY AND THE PASSENGERS BECAME IMPATIENT OF THE LONG MONSTROUS WAVES WHICH THE WIND RAISED BEFORE THEIR PATH
THE PERSON OF THE DELIGHTFUL FIX ON SUNDAY OCTOBER TWENTIETH TOWARDS NOON THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE INDIAN COAST TWO HOURS LATER THE PILOT CAME ON BOARD
AND I MUST GET TO YOKOHAMA BY THE FOURTEENTH AT THE LATEST TO TAKE THE BOAT FOR SAN FRANCISCO I AM SORRY SAID THE SAILOR BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE I OFFER YOU A HUNDRED POUNDS PER DAY
NOW MONEY FAILED STILL SOME MEANS MUST BE FOUND TO CROSS THE ATLANTIC ON A BOAT UNLESS BY BALLOON WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN VENTURESOME BESIDES NOT BEING CAPABLE OF BEING PUT IN PRACTICE
IT PASSES ALONG THE LEFT BANK OF THE PLATTE RIVER AS FAR AS THE JUNCTION OF ITS NORTHERN BRANCH FOLLOWS ITS SOUTHERN BRANCH CROSSES THE LARAMIE TERRITORY AND THE WAHSATCH MOUNTAINS TURNS THE GREAT SALT LAKE AND REACHES SALT LAKE CITY
AND OFFERING HIS ARM TO AOUDA HE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARD THE DOCKS IN SEARCH OF SOME CRAFT ABOUT TO START FIX STUPEFIED FOLLOWED IT SEEMED AS IF HE WERE ATTACHED TO MISTER FOGG BY AN INVISIBLE THREAD
PERPENDICULAR TO THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAIN ON EITHER SIDE OF AN AISLE WHICH CONDUCTED TO THE FRONT AND REAR PLATFORMS THESE PLATFORMS WERE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE TRAIN AND THE PASSENGERS WERE ABLE TO PASS FROM ONE END OF THE TRAIN TO THE OTHER
THERE WERE NINE DAYS THIRTEEN HOURS AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES IF PHILEAS FOGG HAD LEFT IN THE CHINA ONE OF THE FASTEST STEAMERS ON THE ATLANTIC HE WOULD HAVE REACHED LIVERPOOL AND THEN LONDON WITHIN THE PERIOD AGREED UPON
ONE WAS THE BRITISH CONSUL AT SUEZ WHO DESPITE THE PROPHECIES OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT AND THE UNFAVOURABLE
WERE YOU NOT LIKE ME SIR A PASSENGER BY THE RANGOON WHICH ARRIVED YESTERDAY I WAS SIR REPLIED MISTER FOGG COLDLY BUT I HAVE NOT THE HONOUR PARDON ME I THOUGHT I SHOULD FIND YOUR SERVANT HERE
GOING IN BALLAST HAVE YOU ANY PASSENGERS
FEARED THAT HE WAS ON THE WRONG BOAT BUT THOUGH HE WAS REALLY ON THE CARNATIC HIS MASTER WAS NOT THERE HE FELL THUNDERSTRUCK ON A SEAT HE SAW IT ALL NOW
IT OVERWHELMED HIM TO LOSE THE BOAT BY THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IT WAS HIS FAULT FOR INSTEAD OF HELPING HIS MASTER HE HAD NOT CEASED PUTTING OBSTACLES IN HIS PATH AND WHEN HE RECALLED ALL THE INCIDENTS OF THE TOUR
BUT NEVER YELLOW LIKE THE CHINESE FROM WHOM THE JAPANESE WIDELY DIFFER
YES YOUR HONOUR WILL BE SATISFIED WITH HER IS IT FOR A SEA EXCURSION NO FOR A VOYAGE A VOYAGE YES WILL YOU AGREE TO TAKE ME TO YOKOHAMA
OUGHT NOT TO SPEND HIS LIFE JUMPING FROM A STEAMER UPON A RAILWAY TRAIN AND FROM A RAILWAY TRAIN UPON A STEAMER AGAIN
SOME GAME OR FISH WHICH WITH RICE THE JAPANESE EAT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
HE DID NOT HESITATE WHAT TO DO IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO CONTINUE ON TO OMAHA FOR IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO RETURN TO THE TRAIN WHICH THE INDIANS MIGHT STILL BE ENGAGED IN PILLAGING
BUT ADDED THE PILOT IT MIGHT BE ARRANGED ANOTHER WAY FIX CEASED TO BREATHE AT ALL HOW ASKED MISTER FOGG
IF HIS SERVANT WAS A PRISONER OUGHT HE NOT TO RISK EVERYTHING TO RESCUE HIM FROM THE INDIANS I WILL FIND HIM LIVING OR DEAD SAID HE QUIETLY TO AOUDA AH MISTER MISTER FOGG CRIED SHE
POINT OF ORDERING A RECONNAISSANCE WHEN GUNSHOTS WERE HEARD WAS IT A SIGNAL THE SOLDIERS RUSHED OUT OF THE FORT AND HALF A MILE OFF THEY PERCEIVED A LITTLE BAND RETURNING IN GOOD ORDER MISTER FOGG WAS MARCHING AT THEIR HEAD AND JUST BEHIND HIM
HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND WOULD CERTAINLY NOT COME OUT OF THIS AFFAIR WELL INDEMNIFIED
LEFT THAT GENTLEMAN ON THE LEVELLED HULK OF HIS CRAFT
YOU WOULD NOT BE AFRAID WOULD YOU MADAM NOT WITH YOU MISTER FOGG WAS HER ANSWER THE PILOT NOW RETURNED SHUFFLING HIS HAT IN HIS HANDS WELL PILOT SAID MISTER FOGG WELL YOUR HONOUR REPLIED HE
AND IN THAT TIME IF WE HAD GOOD LUCK AND A SOUTH WEST WIND AND THE SEA WAS CALM WE COULD MAKE THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED MILES TO SHANGHAI AND YOU COULD GO IN AN HOUR AS SOON AS PROVISIONS COULD BE GOT ABOARD AND THE SAILS PUT UP
AND RUSH ON WITH A SPEED OF NINETY MILES AN HOUR IT CONTINUED FRESH BUT UNHAPPILY IT REMAINED OBSTINATELY IN THE SOUTH EAST RENDERING THE SAILS USELESS THE SIXTEENTH OF DECEMBER WAS THE SEVENTY FIFTH DAY SINCE PHILEAS FOGG'S DEPARTURE FROM LONDON AND THE HENRIETTA HAD NOT YET BEEN SERIOUSLY DELAYED
PRESIDENT LINCOLN HIMSELF FIXED THE END OF THE LINE AT OMAHA IN NEBRASKA THE WORK WAS AT ONCE COMMENCED AND PURSUED WITH TRUE AMERICAN ENERGY
THE STREETS AT LAST BECAME QUIET AND THE PATROL THE OFFICERS OF WHICH IN THEIR SPLENDID COSTUMES AND SURROUNDED BY THEIR SUITES PASSEPARTOUT THOUGHT SEEMED LIKE AMBASSADORS SUCCEEDED THE BUSTLING CROWD
BESIDES WE COULD NOT REACH YOKOHAMA IN TIME FOR IT IS SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILES FROM HONG KONG ONLY SIXTEEN HUNDRED SAID MISTER FOGG
AND TOOK HIS MEALS CONSCIENTIOUSLY
AND FOR TWO DAYS THE POOR FELLOW EXPERIENCED CONSTANT FRIGHT
FOR WANT OF FUEL THE STEAM HAD SLACKENED AND IT HAD FINALLY STOPPED AN HOUR AFTER SOME TWENTY MILES BEYOND FORT KEARNEY NEITHER THE ENGINEER NOR THE STOKER WAS DEAD AND AFTER REMAINING FOR SOME TIME IN THEIR SWOON HAD COME TO THEMSELVES
AND THESE FOUR WORDS COMPOSE THE GENERAL DESIGNATION OF THE GREAT TRUNK LINE WHICH CROSSES THE ENTIRE WIDTH OF THE UNITED STATES THE PACIFIC RAILROAD IS HOWEVER REALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO DISTINCT LINES
THERE PASSEPARTOUT BEHELD BEAUTIFUL FIR AND CEDAR GROVES SACRED GATES OF A SINGULAR ARCHITECTURE BRIDGES HALF HID IN THE MIDST OF BAMBOOS AND REEDS TEMPLES SHADED BY IMMENSE CEDAR TREES HOLY RETREATS
THE LIVES OF THREE MEN ARE IN QUESTION SIR SAID PHILEAS FOGG DOUBTLESS BUT CAN I RISK THE LIVES OF FIFTY MEN TO SAVE THREE
THERE WAS BUT LITTLE CONVERSATION IN THE CAR AND SOON MANY OF THE PASSENGERS WERE OVERCOME WITH SLEEP
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PORT OF CALL IN THE PACIFIC
WE COULD MAKE THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED MILES TO SHANGHAI
WHICH GAVE HIM THE DAILY MOVEMENTS OF THE TRANS ATLANTIC STEAMERS
CRIED CAPTAIN SPEEDY I HAVE SENT FOR YOU SIR PICKAROON SIR CONTINUED MISTER FOGG TO ASK YOU TO SELL ME YOUR VESSEL NO
IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN SAID HE APPROACHING THIS PERSON WITH HIS MOST AMIABLE SMILE YOU ARE THE GENTLEMAN WHO SO KINDLY VOLUNTEERED TO GUIDE ME AT SUEZ AH I QUITE RECOGNISE YOU YOU ARE THE SERVANT OF THE STRANGE ENGLISHMAN
SHOULD HE SEND ANOTHER DETACHMENT TO THE RESCUE OF THE FIRST SHOULD HE SACRIFICE MORE MEN WITH SO FEW CHANCES OF SAVING THOSE ALREADY SACRIFICED HIS HESITATION DID NOT LAST LONG HOWEVER CALLING ONE OF HIS LIEUTENANTS HE WAS ON THE
BUT A REAL ART MISTER FIX EVIDENTLY WAS NOT WANTING
BUT IT WAS NOW POSSIBLE TO RECOGNISE OBJECTS TWO MILES OFF PHILEAS FOGG AND THE SQUAD HAD GONE SOUTHWARD IN THE SOUTH ALL WAS STILL VACANCY IT WAS THEN SEVEN O'CLOCK THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS REALLY ALARMED DID NOT KNOW WHAT COURSE TO TAKE
THE LATTER BEING EITHER ATTACHED TO THE REGULAR BRITISH FORCES OR
AND A DOZEN BOATS PUSHED OFF FROM THE SHORE TO GO AND MEET THE STEAMER SOON HER GIGANTIC HULL APPEARED PASSING ALONG BETWEEN THE BANKS AND ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK AS SHE ANCHORED IN THE ROAD
THE TRAVELLERS WERE GLAD TO SEE THE LOCOMOTIVE RESUME ITS PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN THEY COULD NOW CONTINUE THE JOURNEY SO TERRIBLY INTERRUPTED AOUDA ON SEEING THE LOCOMOTIVE COME UP
NEVERTHELESS HE BEGAN TO REBUILD THE FIRE IN THE FURNACE THE PRESSURE AGAIN MOUNTED AND THE LOCOMOTIVE RETURNED RUNNING BACKWARDS TO FORT KEARNEY THIS IT WAS WHICH WAS WHISTLING IN THE MIST
BUT HE COULD ONLY FIND VESSELS WHICH WERE LOADING OR UNLOADING AND WHICH COULD NOT THEREFORE SET SAIL FIX BEGAN TO HOPE AGAIN BUT MISTER FOGG FAR FROM BEING DISCOURAGED
AND AN ADDITIONAL REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS IF I REACH YOKOHAMA IN TIME ARE YOU IN EARNEST VERY MUCH SO THE PILOT WALKED AWAY A LITTLE DISTANCE AND GAZED OUT TO SEA
AT TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE TWELVE TWENTY FIRST DECEMBER HE WAS ONLY SIX HOURS DISTANT FROM LONDON
BUT I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO BURN HER BURN THE HENRIETTA YES AT LEAST THE UPPER PART OF HER THE COAL HAS GIVEN OUT BURN MY VESSEL CRIED CAPTAIN SPEEDY WHO COULD SCARCELY PRONOUNCE THE WORDS
SO DID I MADAM AND I AM EXCESSIVELY DISAPPOINTED THE CARNATIC ITS REPAIRS BEING COMPLETED LEFT HONG KONG TWELVE HOURS BEFORE THE STATED TIME
EXCUSE ME DID YOU INTEND TO SAIL IN THE CARNATIC YES SIR SO DID I MADAM AND I AM EXCESSIVELY DISAPPOINTED THE CARNATIC ITS REPAIRS BEING COMPLETED LEFT HONG KONG TWELVE HOURS BEFORE THE STATED TIME WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BEING GIVEN
WERE PASSEPARTOUT AND THE OTHER TWO TRAVELLERS RESCUED FROM THE SIOUX THEY HAD MET AND FOUGHT THE INDIANS TEN MILES SOUTH OF FORT KEARNEY SHORTLY BEFORE THE DETACHMENT ARRIVED
THE CARNATIC WOULD LEAVE THE HARBOUR MISTER FOGG AND AOUDA GOT INTO THE PALANQUIN THEIR LUGGAGE BEING BROUGHT AFTER ON A WHEELBARROW
SEEING FROM HIS OFFICE WINDOW ENGLISH SHIPS DAILY PASSING TO AND FRO ON THE GREAT CANAL BY WHICH THE OLD ROUNDABOUT ROUTE FROM ENGLAND TO INDIA BY THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE WAS ABRIDGED
TO HAVE THE PASSPORT AGAIN VISAED FIX UNOBSERVED FOLLOWED THEM THE VISA PROCURED MISTER FOGG RETURNED ON BOARD TO RESUME HIS FORMER HABITS
IS YOUR HONOUR LOOKING FOR A BOAT HAVE YOU A BOAT READY TO SAIL
THAT HE DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE AN INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH IT HE OFTEN CORRECTED WITH A FEW CLEAR WORDS THE THOUSAND CONJECTURES ADVANCED BY MEMBERS OF THE CLUB AS TO LOST
FOUR CAPTAIN SPEEDY BEGAN TO SCRATCH HIS HEAD THERE WERE EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GAIN WITHOUT CHANGING HIS ROUTE FOR WHICH IT WAS WELL WORTH CONQUERING THE REPUGNANCE HE HAD FOR ALL KINDS OF PASSENGERS
HAVING BREAKFASTED MISTER FOGG AND HIS COMPANIONS RESUMED THEIR PLACES IN THE CAR AND OBSERVED THE VARIED LANDSCAPE WHICH UNFOLDED ITSELF AS THEY PASSED ALONG THE VAST PRAIRIES
HER TWO MASTS LEANED A TRIFLE BACKWARD SHE CARRIED BRIGANTINE FORESAIL STORM JIB AND STANDING JIB AND WAS WELL RIGGED FOR RUNNING BEFORE THE WIND AND SHE SEEMED CAPABLE OF BRISK SPEED WHICH INDEED
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG
BY GOING TO NAGASAKI AT THE EXTREME SOUTH OF JAPAN OR EVEN TO SHANGHAI WHICH IS ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED MILES FROM HERE
IT SEEMED THAT PHILEAS FOGG HAD AN IDEA FOR HE SAID TO THE CAPTAIN WELL WILL YOU CARRY ME TO BORDEAUX NO NOT IF YOU PAID ME TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS
IT WAS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO THAT IN SPITE OF THE SOUTHERN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO WISHED A MORE SOUTHERLY ROUTE IT WAS DECIDED TO LAY THE ROAD BETWEEN THE FORTY FIRST AND FORTY SECOND PARALLELS
A DETECTIVE ON THE TRACK OF MISTER FOGG ACCUSED OF ROBBING THE BANK OF ENGLAND PSHAW MISTER FOGG IS NO MORE A ROBBER THAN I AM A MURDERER SHOULD HE DIVULGE FIX'S REAL ERRAND TO HIS MASTER WOULD IT DO TO TELL THE PART THE DETECTIVE WAS PLAYING
IT WAS NOW THREE O'CLOCK
UNVARYING AS THE SHIP'S CHRONOMETERS AND SELDOM HAVING THE CURIOSITY EVEN TO GO UPON THE DECK HE PASSED
DON'T LET THIS ASTONISH YOU SIR YOU MUST KNOW THAT I SHALL LOSE TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS UNLESS I ARRIVE IN LONDON BY A QUARTER BEFORE NINE ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FIRST OF DECEMBER I MISSED THE STEAMER AT NEW YORK AND AS YOU REFUSED TO TAKE ME TO LIVERPOOL
AND WAS WELL RIGGED FOR RUNNING BEFORE THE WIND AND SHE SEEMED CAPABLE OF BRISK SPEED WHICH INDEED SHE HAD ALREADY PROVED BY GAINING SEVERAL PRIZES IN PILOT BOAT RACES
THE CREW OF THE TANKADERE WAS COMPOSED OF JOHN BUNSBY THE MASTER AND FOUR HARDY MARINERS WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE CHINESE SEAS JOHN BUNSBY HIMSELF A MAN OF FORTY FIVE OR THEREABOUTS VIGOROUS SUNBURNT
AND THE PASSENGERS WERE GOING ASHORE CHANCE HAD STRANGELY FAVOURED PHILEAS FOGG
AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH THE ROLLING OF THE STEAMER TO THE AFTER DECK HE SAW NO ONE WHO RESEMBLED EITHER HIS MASTER OR AOUDA GOOD MUTTERED HE AOUDA HAS NOT GOT UP YET AND MISTER FOGG HAS PROBABLY FOUND SOME PARTNERS AT WHIST HE DESCENDED TO THE SALOON MISTER FOGG WAS NOT THERE
HE MADE NO ACCOUNT OF THIS INCONVENIENCE AND WHILST HIS BODY WAS WRITHING UNDER THEIR EFFECTS HIS SPIRIT BOUNDED WITH HOPEFUL EXULTATION
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME EARNEST MONEY IF IT WOULD NOT PUT YOUR HONOUR OUT HERE ARE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS ON ACCOUNT SIR ADDED PHILEAS FOGG TURNING TO FIX IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
KNOW MY CONDITIONS YES MONSIEUR GOOD WHAT TIME IS IT TWENTY TWO MINUTES AFTER ELEVEN
IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN THE TRAIN PASSED THROUGH THE DEFILES OF THE HUMBOLDT RANGE AND HALF PAST NINE WHEN IT PENETRATED UTAH
WITHOUT ANY NOTICE BEING GIVEN AND WE MUST NOW WAIT A WEEK FOR ANOTHER STEAMER AS HE SAID A WEEK FIX FELT HIS HEART LEAP FOR JOY
MISTER FOGG HAD TAKEN AWAY THE MATCH AND I SHALL STILL HAVE THE IRON HULL
THE JOURNEY FROM NEW YORK TO SAN FRANCISCO CONSUMED FORMERLY UNDER THE MOST FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS AT LEAST SIX MONTHS IT IS NOW ACCOMPLISHED IN SEVEN DAYS
SOME RETAINING THE FANTASTIC FASHION OF ANCIENT GALLEYS WERE
BETWEEN OMAHA AND THE PACIFIC THE RAILWAY CROSSES A TERRITORY WHICH IS STILL INFESTED BY INDIANS AND WILD BEASTS AND A LARGE TRACT WHICH THE MORMONS AFTER THEY WERE DRIVEN FROM ILLINOIS IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE BEGAN TO COLONISE
CARRIAGES AND PALANQUINS BARROWS SUPPLIED WITH SAILS AND LITTERS MADE OF BAMBOO NOR THE WOMEN WHOM HE THOUGHT NOT ESPECIALLY HANDSOME WHO TOOK LITTLE STEPS WITH THEIR LITTLE FEET WHEREON THEY WORE CANVAS SHOES STRAW SANDALS AND CLOGS OF WORKED WOOD
OF THE NEXT STEAMER MISTER FOGG WAS IT IS TRUE TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEHIND HIS TIME BUT THIS COULD NOT SERIOUSLY IMPERIL THE REMAINDER OF HIS TOUR THE STEAMER
AT SIGHT FROM HIS ACCOUNT CURRENT WHICH WAS ALWAYS FLUSH WAS PHILEAS FOGG RICH UNDOUBTEDLY BUT THOSE WHO KNEW HIM BEST COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE AND MISTER FOGG
YOU WILL REMAIN WITH AOUDA IN CASE ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO ME A SUDDEN PALLOR OVERSPREAD THE DETECTIVE'S FACE SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM THE MAN WHOM HE HAD SO PERSISTENTLY FOLLOWED STEP BY STEP
AND WHICH TO THEIR MINDS SYMBOLISE LONG LIFE AND PROSPERITY
LEST CHANCE SHOULD DIRECT THE STEPS OF THE UNFORTUNATE SERVANT WHOM HE HAD SO BADLY TREATED IN THIS DIRECTION IN WHICH CASE AN EXPLANATION THE REVERSE OF SATISFACTORY TO THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE ENSUED
AND LOOKED ABOUT AMONG THE VESSELS MOORED OR ANCHORED IN THE RIVER FOR ANY THAT WERE ABOUT TO DEPART SEVERAL HAD DEPARTURE SIGNALS AND WERE PREPARING TO PUT TO SEA AT MORNING TIDE
WHAT WILL MISTER FOGG SAY AT LEAST I HAVE NOT MISSED THE STEAMER WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THEN AS FIX OCCURRED TO HIM
THE LOCOMOTIVE WHICH WAS SLOWLY APPROACHING WITH DEAFENING WHISTLES WAS THAT WHICH HAVING BEEN DETACHED FROM THE TRAIN HAD CONTINUED ITS ROUTE WITH SUCH TERRIFIC RAPIDITY CARRYING OFF THE UNCONSCIOUS ENGINEER AND STOKER
THE TRAIN WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN THROWN OFF THE TRACK AND WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN HELPLESS THE BEST COURSE WAS TO WAIT PATIENTLY AND REGAIN THE LOST TIME BY GREATER SPEED WHEN THE OBSTACLE WAS REMOVED
HIS HORROR MAY BE IMAGINED WHEN HE HEARD MISTER FOGG SAY IN HIS PLACID VOICE BUT THERE ARE OTHER VESSELS BESIDES THE CARNATIC IT SEEMS TO ME IN THE HARBOUR OF HONG KONG
AND KNEW HOW TO MAINTAIN HEADWAY AGAINST THE SEA AND HE KEPT ON HIS COURSE WITHOUT EVEN DECREASING HIS STEAM
AND NUMBERS OF MILITARY FOLK OF ALL RANKS FOR THE MILITARY PROFESSION IS AS MUCH RESPECTED IN JAPAN AS IT IS DESPISED IN CHINA WENT HITHER AND THITHER IN GROUPS AND PAIRS
AND EVEN THE INSEPARABLE FIX WAS THE WORK OF A BRIEF TIME AND WAS PERFORMED BY MISTER FOGG WITH THE COOLNESS WHICH NEVER ABANDONED HIM THEY WERE ON BOARD WHEN THE HENRIETTA MADE READY TO WEIGH ANCHOR
THE NEXT MORNING MISTER FOGG HAD SIXTEEN HOURS IN WHICH TO ATTEND TO HIS BUSINESS THERE WHICH WAS
I WILL NOT GO SAID AOUDA FIX HAD HEARD THIS CONVERSATION A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE WHEN THERE WAS NO PROSPECT OF PROCEEDING ON THE JOURNEY HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE FORT KEARNEY
ON THE BRANCHES OF THE CEDARS WERE PERCHED LARGE EAGLES AMID THE FOLIAGE OF THE WEEPING WILLOWS WERE HERONS SOLEMNLY STANDING ON ONE LEG AND ON EVERY HAND WERE CROWS DUCKS HAWKS WILD BIRDS AND A MULTITUDE OF CRANES
SOME DAYS AT HONG KONG AND NOW THE HEAVENS THEMSELVES BECAME HIS ALLIES WITH THE GUSTS AND SQUALLS IT MATTERED NOT THAT THEY MADE HIM SEA SICK
THE TIME PASSED QUICKLY ON THE MONGOLIA THE BEST OF FARE WAS SPREAD UPON THE CABIN TABLES AT BREAKFAST LUNCH DINNER AND THE EIGHT O'CLOCK SUPPER AND THE LADIES
FIX BEGAN TO HOPE AGAIN BUT MISTER FOGG FAR FROM BEING DISCOURAGED WAS CONTINUING HIS SEARCH
TURNED THE POINT OF SANDY HOOK AND PUT TO SEA DURING THE DAY SHE SKIRTED LONG ISLAND PASSED FIRE ISLAND AND DIRECTED HER COURSE RAPIDLY EASTWARD
IT IS THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND TEN MILES FROM SUEZ TO ADEN AT THE OTHER END OF THE RED SEA AND SHE HAS TO TAKE IN A FRESH COAL SUPPLY AND DOES SHE GO FROM SUEZ DIRECTLY TO BOMBAY
AS FOR PASSEPARTOUT HE THOUGHT MISTER FOGG'S MANOEUVRE SIMPLY GLORIOUS THE CAPTAIN HAD SAID BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE KNOTS AND THE HENRIETTA CONFIRMED HIS PREDICTION IF THEN FOR THERE WERE IFS STILL THE SEA DID NOT BECOME TOO BOISTEROUS IF THE WIND DID NOT VEER ROUND TO THE EAST IF NO ACCIDENT HAPPENED TO THE BOAT OR ITS MACHINERY
DETERMINED IF NECESSARY TO PUSH ON TO YEDDO THE JAPANESE QUARTER OF YOKOHAMA IS CALLED BENTEN AFTER THE GODDESS OF THE SEA WHO IS WORSHIPPED ON THE ISLANDS ROUND ABOUT
AH SAID MISTER FOGG WITHOUT BETRAYING ANY ASTONISHMENT
ON THE RED SEA AS HE PASSED AMONG THE BUSY CROWD FIX ACCORDING TO HABIT SCRUTINISED
THE COMMANDER OF THE FORT WAS ANXIOUS THOUGH HE TRIED TO CONCEAL HIS APPREHENSIONS AS NIGHT APPROACHED THE SNOW FELL LESS PLENTIFULLY BUT IT BECAME INTENSELY COLD ABSOLUTE SILENCE RESTED ON THE PLAINS
MAKING THE NECESSARY PURCHASES FOR THE LONG VOYAGE BEFORE THEM IT WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR AN ENGLISHMAN LIKE MISTER FOGG TO MAKE THE TOUR OF THE WORLD WITH A CARPET BAG A LADY COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO TRAVEL COMFORTABLY UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS
WE WILL BE ON BOARD AT NINE O'CLOCK REPLIED NO LESS SIMPLY MISTER FOGG IT WAS HALF PAST EIGHT TO DISEMBARK FROM THE HENRIETTA JUMP INTO A HACK HURRY TO THE SAINT NICHOLAS AND RETURN WITH AOUDA
BRINDISI AND BOMBAY
SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT ON THE SIXTH OF NOVEMBER AND THE PASSENGERS FOR JAPAN WOULD HAVE
PERFECTLY AND WHEN DOES THE BOAT LEAVE SHANGHAI ON THE ELEVENTH AT SEVEN IN THE EVENING WE HAVE THEREFORE FOUR DAYS BEFORE US THAT IS NINETY SIX HOURS
THESE INNUMERABLE MULTITUDES OF RUMINATING BEASTS OFTEN FORM AN INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE TO THE PASSAGE OF THE TRAINS THOUSANDS OF THEM HAVE BEEN SEEN PASSING OVER THE TRACK FOR HOURS TOGETHER IN COMPACT RANKS
YOU MUST HAVE A SCENT FOR THEM AND A SCENT IS LIKE A SIXTH SENSE WHICH COMBINES HEARING SEEING AND SMELLING I'VE ARRESTED MORE THAN ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN IN MY TIME AND IF MY THIEF IS ON BOARD
ARE EQUAL TO ANY IN SPEED AND COMFORT
SHAKING HANDS WITH HER PROTECTOR AFTER THE ENGLISH FASHION RETIRED TO HER ROOM FOR REST MISTER FOGG ABSORBED HIMSELF THROUGHOUT THE EVENING IN THE PERUSAL OF THE TIMES AND ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS
WHICH WAS GOING ON WITHIN HIM HE LOWERED HIS EYES BEFORE THAT CALM AND FRANK LOOK I WILL STAY SAID HE A FEW MOMENTS AFTER MISTER FOGG PRESSED THE YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND
I OFFER YOU TWO THOUSAND APIECE APIECE
WITH THE OTHER WOUNDED PASSENGERS TO RECEIVE SUCH ATTENTION AS COULD BE OF AVAIL AOUDA WAS SAFE AND PHILEAS FOGG WHO HAD BEEN IN THE THICKEST OF THE FIGHT HAD NOT RECEIVED A SCRATCH
TO A PALANQUIN
THE TRAVELLERS GAZED ON THIS CURIOUS SPECTACLE FROM THE PLATFORMS BUT PHILEAS FOGG WHO HAD THE MOST REASON OF ALL TO BE IN A HURRY REMAINED IN HIS SEAT AND WAITED PHILOSOPHICALLY UNTIL IT SHOULD PLEASE THE BUFFALOES TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
AND HE HAD ONLY TO TAKE HIS SEAT IN THE CAR AN IRRESISTIBLE INFLUENCE HELD HIM BACK THE STATION PLATFORM BURNED HIS FEET AND HE COULD NOT STIR THE CONFLICT IN HIS MIND AGAIN BEGAN ANGER AND FAILURE STIFLED HIM
BELOW DECK WAS A SQUARE CABIN OF WHICH THE WALLS BULGED OUT IN THE FORM OF COTS ABOVE A CIRCULAR DIVAN
OF GYMNASTICS SO AS TO MAKE BETTER USE OF MY TALENTS AND THEN I WAS A SERGEANT FIREMAN AT PARIS
BUT A VERY FINE STRINGY TOBACCO HE WENT ON TILL HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE FIELDS IN THE MIDST OF VAST RICE PLANTATIONS THERE HE SAW DAZZLING CAMELLIAS EXPANDING THEMSELVES WITH FLOWERS WHICH WERE GIVING FORTH THEIR LAST COLOURS AND PERFUMES
WHOM HE HAD SO BADLY TREATED IN THIS DIRECTION IN WHICH CASE AN EXPLANATION THE REVERSE OF SATISFACTORY TO THE DETECTIVE MUST HAVE ENSUED BUT THE FRENCHMAN DID NOT APPEAR
HE MADE HIS FOUR HEARTY MEALS EVERY DAY REGARDLESS OF THE MOST PERSISTENT ROLLING AND PITCHING ON THE PART OF THE STEAMER
THE CENTRAL PACIFIC TAKING SACRAMENTO FOR ITS STARTING POINT EXTENDS EASTWARD TO MEET THE ROAD FROM OMAHA THE LINE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SACRAMENTO RUNS IN A NORTH EASTERLY DIRECTION ALONG THE AMERICAN RIVER
