ALICE ASKED VERY MUCH SURPRISED AT HIS TAKING IT SO QUIETLY
GYROSCOPE TO GIMBLE
IS THAT A BARGAIN YES IF YOU LIKE SAID ALICE
WHAT A LOVELY ONE ONLY I COULDN'T QUITE REACH IT AND IT CERTAINLY DID SEEM A LITTLE PROVOKING ALMOST AS IF IT HAPPENED ON PURPOSE SHE THOUGHT THAT THOUGH SHE MANAGED TO PICK PLENTY OF BEAUTIFUL RUSHES
HUMPTY DUMPTY EXCLAIMED TRIUMPHANTLY YOU NEVER SAID A WORD LIKE IT
ALICE TOOK A PIECE TO TASTE BUT IT WAS VERY DRY I DON'T THINK THEY'LL FIGHT ANY MORE TO DAY THE KING SAID TO HATTA GO AND ORDER THE DRUMS TO BEGIN AND HATTA WENT BOUNDING AWAY LIKE A GRASSHOPPER
CLEARLY THAT IT WAS HUMPTY DUMPTY HIMSELF IT CAN'T BE ANYBODY ELSE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I'M AS CERTAIN OF IT
THEY WERE ALWAYS TRIPPING OVER SOMETHING OR OTHER AND WHENEVER ONE WENT DOWN SEVERAL MORE ALWAYS FELL OVER HIM SO THAT THE GROUND WAS SOON COVERED WITH LITTLE HEAPS OF MEN THEN CAME THE HORSES HAVING FOUR FEET
OF COURSE I DON'T THINK SO WHY IF
SHE NEVER FINISHED THE SENTENCE FOR AT THIS MOMENT
SO SHE SAT DOWN AND SAID
SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY STRETCHING OUT ONE OF HIS GREAT HANDS
SHE CORRECTED HERSELF ON SECOND THOUGHTS A BEAUTIFUL CRAVAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID
SHE ADDED HOPING TO TURN HER REMARK INTO A SORT OF A COMPLIMENT SOME PEOPLE SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKING AWAY FROM HER AS USUAL HAVE NO MORE SENSE THAN A BABY
ALL THAT HARD STUFF TO YOU I READ IT IN A BOOK SAID ALICE BUT I HAD SOME POETRY REPEATED TO ME MUCH EASIER THAN THAT
FIT FOR THE DEED I HAD TO DO MY HEART WENT HOP MY HEART WENT THUMP I FILLED THE KETTLE AT THE PUMP THEN SOME ONE CAME TO ME AND SAID
MOUTH UNDER IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME NOW IF YOU HAD THE TWO EYES ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE NOSE FOR INSTANCE OR THE MOUTH AT THE TOP THAT
WHEN I FASTEN MY SHAWL AGAIN THE POOR QUEEN GROANED OUT THE BROOCH WILL COME UNDONE DIRECTLY OH OH
LET'S GO BACK TO THE LAST REMARK BUT ONE I'M AFRAID I CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER IT ALICE SAID VERY POLITELY IN THAT CASE WE START FRESH
AND KICKED AND KNOCKED AND WHEN I FOUND THE DOOR WAS SHUT I TRIED TO TURN THE HANDLE BUT THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE IS THAT ALL ALICE TIMIDLY ASKED
IT CAN'T GO STRAIGHT YOU KNOW IF YOU PIN IT ALL
I HAVEN'T PRICKED IT YET THE QUEEN SAID BUT I SOON SHALL OH OH OH
I NEVER SAW ONE ALIVE BEFORE
JUST AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THAT WAS A NICE CRAB YOU CAUGHT SHE REMARKED AS ALICE GOT BACK INTO HER PLACE VERY MUCH RELIEVED TO FIND HERSELF STILL IN THE BOAT WAS IT I DIDN'T SEE IT SAID ALICE
IMPENETRABILITY THAT'S WHAT I SAY
HOW OLD ARE YOU ALICE EXPLAINED IF I'D MEANT THAT
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE ALL THE BETTER HIS BEING PUNISHED YOU'RE WRONG THERE AT ANY RATE SAID THE QUEEN WERE YOU EVER PUNISHED ONLY FOR FAULTS SAID ALICE AND YOU WERE ALL THE BETTER FOR IT I KNOW THE QUEEN SAID TRIUMPHANTLY YES
I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW THE LION GROWLED OUT AS HE LAY DOWN AGAIN THERE WAS TOO MUCH DUST TO SEE ANYTHING WHAT A TIME THE MONSTER IS CUTTING UP THAT CAKE
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME SAY FEATHER THE SHEEP CRIED ANGRILY TAKING UP QUITE A BUNCH OF NEEDLES INDEED I DID SAID ALICE YOU'VE SAID IT VERY OFTEN AND VERY LOUD PLEASE WHERE ARE THE CRABS IN THE WATER OF COURSE SAID THE SHEEP
CRIED HUMPTY DUMPTY
HUMPTY DUMPTY CRIED BREAKING INTO A SUDDEN PASSION YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING AT DOORS AND BEHIND TREES AND DOWN CHIMNEYS OR YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT
THE BROOCH FLEW OPEN AND THE QUEEN CLUTCHED WILDLY AT IT AND TRIED TO CLASP IT AGAIN TAKE CARE CRIED ALICE YOU'RE HOLDING IT ALL CROOKED AND SHE CAUGHT AT THE BROOCH BUT IT WAS TOO LATE THE PIN HAD SLIPPED AND THE QUEEN HAD PRICKED HER FINGER
ALICE SAID INDIGNANTLY TOO PROUD THE OTHER INQUIRED
SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY AND IT'S MY TURN TO CHOOSE A SUBJECT HE TALKS ABOUT IT JUST AS IF IT WAS A GAME THOUGHT ALICE SO HERE'S A QUESTION FOR YOU
THAT PARTICULAR SHELF WAS ALWAYS QUITE EMPTY THOUGH THE OTHERS ROUND IT WERE CROWDED AS FULL AS THEY COULD HOLD THINGS FLOW ABOUT SO HERE SHE SAID AT LAST IN A PLAINTIVE TONE AFTER SHE HAD SPENT A MINUTE OR SO IN VAINLY PURSUING A LARGE BRIGHT THING
SHE CAME FLYING OUT OF THE WOOD OVER YONDER HOW FAST THOSE QUEENS CAN RUN
YES ALL HIS HORSES AND ALL HIS MEN HUMPTY DUMPTY WENT ON THEY'D PICK ME UP AGAIN IN A MINUTE THEY WOULD HOWEVER
ALICE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO SAY ANYTHING SO AFTER A MINUTE HUMPTY DUMPTY BEGAN AGAIN THEY'VE A TEMPER SOME OF THEM
WITH JUST THE ENDS OF HER TANGLED HAIR DIPPING INTO THE WATER WHILE WITH BRIGHT EAGER EYES SHE CAUGHT AT ONE BUNCH AFTER ANOTHER OF THE DARLING SCENTED RUSHES I ONLY HOPE THE BOAT WON'T TIPPLE OVER SHE SAID TO HERSELF OH
BUT THE ODDEST PART OF IT ALL WAS THAT WHENEVER SHE LOOKED HARD AT ANY SHELF
HER VOICE WENT HIGHER WITH EACH BETTER TILL IT GOT QUITE TO A SQUEAK AT LAST ALICE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO SAY THERE'S A MISTAKE SOMEWHERE WHEN THE QUEEN BEGAN SCREAMING SO LOUD THAT SHE HAD TO LEAVE THE SENTENCE UNFINISHED
ALICE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THE BANK OF A LITTLE BROOK WITH THE GREAT DISH ON HER KNEES
IF HE SMILED MUCH MORE THE ENDS OF HIS MOUTH MIGHT MEET BEHIND SHE THOUGHT AND THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIS HEAD I'M AFRAID IT WOULD COME OFF
MAYHAP YOU'LL NEVER SEE SUCH ANOTHER
WHEN SHE HAD COME WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF IT SHE SAW THAT IT HAD EYES AND A NOSE AND MOUTH AND WHEN SHE HAD COME CLOSE TO IT SHE SAW
THAT'S A GREAT DEAL TO MAKE ONE WORD MEAN ALICE SAID IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE WHEN I MAKE A WORD DO A LOT OF WORK LIKE THAT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY
FOR A MINUTE OR TWO ALICE STOOD SILENT WATCHING HIM SUDDENLY SHE BRIGHTENED UP
HE REMARKED TO HER AS HE MUNCHED AWAY I SHOULD THINK THROWING COLD WATER OVER YOU WOULD BE BETTER ALICE SUGGESTED OR SOME SAL VOLATILE I DIDN'T SAY THERE WAS NOTHING BETTER THE KING REPLIED
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE SAID ALICE AND HOW MANY BIRTHDAYS HAVE YOU ONE
BUT TELL ME YOUR NAME AND YOUR BUSINESS MY NAME IS ALICE BUT IT'S A STUPID ENOUGH NAME HUMPTY DUMPTY INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY
I BEG YOUR PARDON ALICE SAID WITH A PUZZLED AIR I'M NOT OFFENDED SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY I MEAN WHAT IS AN UN BIRTHDAY PRESENT
AS IF SHE WERE FLYING AND ALICE VERY CIVILLY WENT TO MEET HER WITH THE SHAWL I'M VERY GLAD I HAPPENED TO BE IN THE WAY ALICE SAID AS SHE HELPED HER TO PUT ON HER SHAWL AGAIN THE WHITE QUEEN ONLY LOOKED AT HER IN A HELPLESS FRIGHTENED SORT OF WAY
THOUGH BEN ROGERS GOT A RAG DOLL AND JO HARPER GOT A HYMN BOOK AND A TRACT
AND THE DOOR AIN'T LOCKED AND YOU SHE STOPPED LOOKING KIND OF WONDERING AND THEN SHE TURNED HER HEAD AROUND SLOW AND WHEN HER EYE LIT ON ME I GOT UP AND TOOK A WALK
WHO IS WHY
AND WHIZZED ALONG AFTER THEM TILL WE WAS NEARLY TO THE MILL AND THEN STRUCK UP THROUGH THE BUSH TO WHERE MY CANOE WAS TIED AND HOPPED IN AND PULLED FOR DEAR LIFE TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER
AND SO YOU AIN'T HAD NO MEAT NOR BREAD TO EAT ALL THIS TIME WHY DIDN'T YOU GET MUD TURKLES
WHY CAN'T YOU STICK TO THE MAIN POINT
AND THE OLD WARMING PAN AND MOST A THOUSAND THINGS THAT I DISREMEMBER NOW AND MY NEW CALICO DRESS AND ME AND SILAS AND MY SID AND TOM ON THE CONSTANT WATCH DAY AND NIGHT
WELL ALL RIGHT TOM FIX IT YOUR OWN WAY BUT IF YOU'LL TAKE MY ADVICE YOU'LL LET ME BORROW A SHEET OFF OF THE CLOTHESLINE HE SAID THAT WOULD DO AND THAT GAVE HIM ANOTHER IDEA AND HE SAYS BORROW A SHIRT TOO WHAT DO WE WANT OF A SHIRT TOM
AND SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO TO BED BUT SHE DASN'T SET UP SO THE THING WAS WORKING VERY WELL TOM SAID HE SAID HE NEVER SEE A THING WORK MORE SATISFACTORY HE SAID IT SHOWED IT WAS DONE RIGHT SO HE SAID NOW FOR THE GRAND BULGE

WHY TOM SAWYER HOW YOU TALK I SAYS JIM AIN'T GOT NO USE FOR A ROPE LADDER HE HAS GOT USE FOR IT HOW YOU TALK YOU BETTER SAY YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
AND PRETTY SOON JUMPS UP AND SAYS WHY LAWSAMERCY IT'S MOST NIGHT AND SID NOT COME YET WHAT HAS BECOME OF THAT BOY I SEE MY CHANCE SO I SKIPS UP AND SAYS
I WAITED AND IT SEEMED A GOOD WHILE
LET SID FOOT IT HOME OR CANOE IT WHEN HE GOT DONE FOOLING AROUNDBUT
R G E J A X O
BUT JUST THEN THE DOOR OPENED ONE OF THE MEN STUCK HIS HEAD OUT ONLY ABOUT A COUPLE OF FOOT FROM ME AND I THOUGHT I WAS GONE BUT HE JERKED IT IN AGAIN AND SAYS HEAVE THAT BLAME LANTERN OUT O SIGHT BILL
AND SEARCH HIM AND TAKE HIS CHALK AWAY FROM HIM
NOT IF IT'S FORTY YEAR I KNOWED HE WAS WHITE INSIDE
THAT'S WHY I COME YOU GIT ME THAT MONEY TO MORROW I WANT IT I HAIN'T GOT NO MONEY IT'S A LIE JUDGE THATCHER'S GOT IT YOU GIT IT I WANT IT
IT'S GAUDY HUCK I WISH THERE WAS A MOAT TO THIS CABIN IF WE GET TIME THE NIGHT OF THE ESCAPE WE'LL DIG ONE I SAYS WHAT DO WE WANT OF A MOAT WHEN WE'RE GOING TO SNAKE HIM OUT FROM UNDER THE CABIN BUT HE NEVER HEARD ME
AND A ROUND PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT FOR THE SUN AND YOU COULD SEE THE PENDULUM SWINGING BEHIND IT IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO HEAR THAT CLOCK TICK AND SOMETIMES WHEN ONE OF THESE PEDDLERS HAD BEEN ALONG
TOM SAID HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND JIM'S BED NOW AND WE'D DIG IN UNDER IT AND WHEN WE GOT THROUGH THERE COULDN'T NOBODY IN THE CABIN EVER KNOW THERE WAS ANY HOLE THERE BECAUSE JIM'S COUNTER PIN HUNG DOWN MOST TO THE GROUND
THEY ALL CROWDED UP AND LEANED OVER THE RAILS NEARLY IN MY FACE AND KEPT STILL WATCHING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT I COULD SEE THEM FIRST RATE BUT THEY COULDN'T SEE ME THEN THE CAPTAIN SUNG OUT STAND AWAY
AND I KNOWED HE'D FIXED THE OTHER DOOR TOO THEN HE WENT TO WORK ON THE NIGGER COAXING HIM AND PETTING HIM AND ASKING HIM IF HE'D BEEN IMAGINING HE SAW SOMETHING AGAIN HE RAISED UP AND BLINKED HIS EYES AROUND AND SAYS MARS SID
SO THEN I GOT A SHOVEL AND THEN WE PICKED AND SHOVELED TURN ABOUT AND MADE THE FUR FLY
BY AND BY WHEN WE GOT UP WE TURNED OVER THE TRUCK THE GANG HAD STOLE OFF OF THE WRECK AND FOUND BOOTS AND BLANKETS AND CLOTHES AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS AND A LOT OF BOOKS AND A SPYGLASS
THE SEEGARS WAS PRIME WE LAID OFF ALL THE AFTERNOON IN THE WOODS TALKING AND ME READING THE BOOKS AND HAVING A GENERAL GOOD TIME I TOLD JIM ALL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THE WRECK AND AT THE FERRYBOAT
AND IT TAKES THEM WEEKS AND WEEKS AND WEEKS AND FOR EVER AND EVER WHY LOOK AT ONE OF THEM PRISONERS IN THE BOTTOM DUNGEON OF THE CASTLE DEEF
A VERY NICE KIND LOOKING OLD MAN WHEN I GOT HIM UP I TOLD HIM ME AND MY BROTHER WAS OVER ON SPANISH ISLAND HUNTING YESTERDAY AFTERNOON
BELTED SMALL UNDER THE ARMPITS WITH BULGES LIKE A CABBAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SLEEVES AND A LARGE BLACK SCOOP SHOVEL BONNET WITH A BLACK VEIL AND WHITE SLIM ANKLES CROSSED ABOUT WITH BLACK TAPE
TOM SAID THAT WHAT HE MEANT WAS WE COULD STEAL ANYTHING WE NEEDED WELL I SAYS I NEEDED THE WATERMELON BUT HE SAID I DIDN'T NEED IT TO GET OUT OF PRISON WITH
I WARN'T PROWLING AROUND SIR I FELL OVERBOARD OFF OF THE STEAMBOAT OH YOU DID DID YOU STRIKE A LIGHT THERE SOMEBODY
AND AFTER SUPPER HE TALKED TO HIM ABOUT TEMPERANCE AND SUCH THINGS TILL THE OLD MAN CRIED
SO WE CRUISED ALONG UP SHORE TILL WE GOT KIND OF TIRED AND BEAT OUT AND TIED UP THE CANOE AND WENT TO SLEEP AND NEVER WAKED UP TILL ABOUT AN HOUR AGO
DEY'S TWO GALS FLYIN BOUT YOU IN YO LIFE ONE EM'S LIGHT
AND TOLD HER THE NOISE AND SHOOTING WAKED UP ME AND SID AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED
NOW THERE'S SENSE IN THAT I SAYS LETTING ON DON'T COST NOTHING LETTING ON AIN'T NO TROUBLE AND IF IT'S ANY OBJECT I DON'T MIND LETTING ON WE WAS AT IT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEAR
BUT I'D RUTHER NOT IT'S SO WARM ARE YOU ALL READY ALL RIGHT COME ALONG OLD HOSS COLD CORN PONE COLD CORN BEEF BUTTER
BUT IT WARN'T SO I TRIED IT ONCE I GOT A FISH LINE BUT NO HOOKS IT WARN'T ANY GOOD TO ME WITHOUT HOOKS I TRIED FOR THE HOOKS THREE OR FOUR TIMES BUT SOMEHOW I COULDN'T MAKE IT WORK BY AND BY ONE DAY
AND HE SAID THAT BETWEEN THE RATS AND THE SNAKES AND THE GRINDSTONE THERE WARN'T NO ROOM IN BED FOR HIM SKASELY AND WHEN THERE WAS A BODY COULDN'T SLEEP
BUT I DIDN HAVE NO LUCK WHEN WE UZ MOS DOWN TO DE HEAD ER DE ISLAN A MAN BEGIN TO COME AFT WID DE LANTERN
THERE WAS BEAUTIFUL CURTAINS ON THE WINDOWS WHITE WITH PICTURES PAINTED ON THEM OF CASTLES WITH VINES ALL DOWN THE WALLS AND CATTLE COMING DOWN TO DRINK THERE WAS A LITTLE OLD PIANO TOO THAT HAD TIN PANS IN IT I RECKON
AND SADDLE BAGGSED ON THE WRECK AND THE FERRYMAN AND THE NIGGER WOMAN AND THE HORSES WAS ALL LOST BUT MISS HOOKER SHE MADE A GRAB AND GOT ABOARD THE WRECK WELL
AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT NOBODY EVER HEARD OF SUCH AN IDIOTIC IDEA AND THEN HE WENT TO STUDYING BY AND BY HE SAID HE HAD CIPHERED OUT TWO OR THREE WAYS BUT THERE WARN'T NO NEED TO DECIDE ON ANY OF THEM YET
IN THE REALMS OF THE GOOD AND GREAT IF EMMELINE GRANGERFORD COULD MAKE POETRY LIKE THAT BEFORE SHE WAS FOURTEEN THERE AIN'T NO TELLING WHAT SHE COULD A DONE BY AND BY BUCK SAID SHE COULD RATTLE OFF POETRY LIKE NOTHING
HE'S DRESSED AND EVERYTHING'S READY NOW WE'LL SLIDE OUT AND GIVE THE SHEEP SIGNAL BUT THEN WE HEARD THE TRAMP OF MEN COMING TO THE DOOR AND HEARD THEM BEGIN TO FUMBLE WITH THE PAD LOCK
FOR A CAT AND A COW TO TALK DIFFERENT FROM US
SO AS TO HAVE THEM OUT OF SIGHT AND I PUT OUT THE FIRE AND SCATTERED THE ASHES AROUND TO LOOK LIKE AN OLD LAST YEAR'S CAMP AND THEN CLUMB A TREE I RECKON I WAS UP IN THE TREE TWO HOURS BUT I DIDN'T SEE NOTHING
WELL ONE NIGHT I CREEPS TO DE DO POOTY LATE EN DE DO WARN'T QUITE SHET EN I HEAR OLD MISSUS TELL DE WIDDER
AND THE STEPS A SCRAPING AROUND OUT THERE ALL THE TIME AND AT LAST HE NUDGED US AND WE SLID OUT AND STOOPED DOWN NOT BREATHING AND NOT MAKING THE LEAST NOISE AND SLIPPED
SHE WAS A VISITING THERE AT BOOTH'S LANDING AND JUST IN THE EDGE OF THE EVENING SHE STARTED OVER WITH HER NIGGER WOMAN IN THE HORSE FERRY
I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT I WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOUTHE SIX THOUSAND AND ALL HE LOOKED SURPRISED HE COULDN'T SEEM TO MAKE IT OUT HE SAYS WHY WHAT CAN YOU MEAN MY BOY I SAYS
AND PEEPED THROUGH THE WINDOW INTO THE INTERIOR
A POWDER HORN AND ALL SORTS OF OBJECTS WHICH WERE UPHELD BY THE GIRDLE AS IN A POCKET CAUSED TO BULGE OUT HE CARRIED HIS HEAD THROWN BACKWARDS HIS SHIRT WIDELY OPENED AND TURNED BACK DISPLAYED HIS BULL NECK WHITE AND BARE
FOLDED HIS ARMS AND FELL TO THINKING ABOUT HIS FATHER HE THOUGHT OF THAT HEROIC COLONEL PONTMERCY WHO HAD BEEN SO PROUD A SOLDIER WHO HAD GUARDED THE FRONTIER OF FRANCE UNDER THE REPUBLIC
GAVROCHE WAS WORKING ON THE LARGER ONE
YOU HAVE MURDERED THAT WOMAN LET'S HAVE AN END OF THIS SHOUTED JAVERT IN A FURY I AM NOT HERE TO LISTEN TO ARGUMENT LET US ECONOMIZE ALL THAT THE GUARD IS BELOW MARCH ON INSTANTLY OR YOU'LL GET THE THUMB SCREWS
CAESAR IS STABBED BY THE SENATORS CHRIST IS CUFFED BY LACKEYS ONE FEELS THE GOD THROUGH THE GREATER OUTRAGE
IS IT A QUESTION OF COUNTRY HE ENLISTS IS IT A QUESTION OF LIBERTY HE TEARS UP THE PAVEMENTS BEWARE HIS HAIR FILLED WITH WRATH IS EPIC HIS BLOUSE DRAPES ITSELF LIKE THE FOLDS OF A CHLAMYS
IN CIVILIZATION SUCH AS IT HAS FORMED ITSELF A LITTLE BY THE COMMAND OF GOD A GREAT DEAL BY THE AGENCY OF MAN INTERESTS COMBINE UNITE AND AMALGAMATE IN A MANNER TO FORM A VERITABLE HARD ROCK IN ACCORDANCE WITH A DYNAMIC LAW
WHAT HAD HE COME THERE TO DO MARIUS DID NOT ADDRESS ALL THESE QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF BESIDES SINCE OUR DESPAIR HAS THIS PECULIARITY THAT IT ENVELOPS OTHERS AS WELL AS OURSELVES
MARIUS HAD ALREADY SEEN TOO MUCH OF LIFE NOT TO KNOW THAT NOTHING IS MORE IMMINENT THAN THE IMPOSSIBLE
THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR HAD REMOVED HIS SHOES JEAN VALJEAN THREW HIMSELF ALL DRESSED AS HE WAS ON HIS BED AND COULD NOT CLOSE HIS EYES ALL NIGHT AT DAYBREAK JUST AS HE WAS FALLING INTO A DOZE THROUGH FATIGUE
AND NOT BONAPARTE WHEN ALLUDING TO THE LANDING AT CANNES THE ORDER FOR HIS ARREST WAS ACCORDINGLY DESPATCHED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR ONE MIGHT AS WELL SAY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AS FOR MARIUS AND COSETTE THEY WERE GAZING AT EACH OTHER WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON THEY HARDLY HEEDED THIS DETAIL
SHE BOASTED OF BEING ABLE TO CRACK A NUT WITH ONE BLOW OF HER FIST EXCEPT FOR THE ROMANCES WHICH SHE HAD READ AND WHICH MADE THE AFFECTED LADY PEEP THROUGH THE OGRESS AT TIMES IN A VERY QUEER WAY THE IDEA WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE TO SAY OF HER
MANAGE SO THAT WHEN YOU ARE WITH EACH OTHER NOTHING SHALL BE LACKING TO YOU AND THAT COSETTE MAY BE THE SUN FOR MARIUS AND THAT MARIUS MAY BE THE UNIVERSE TO COSETTE COSETTE LET YOUR FINE WEATHER BE THE SMILE OF YOUR HUSBAND MARIUS
ON SCRUTINIZING THIS LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO HIS CONSCIENCE WITH MORE ATTENTION HE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT IT POSSESSED A HUMAN FORM AND THAT THIS TORCH WAS THE BISHOP
THE MAN SEATED HIMSELF AGAIN AND SAID WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE I AM AT AN INN I AM HUNGRY AND I SHALL REMAIN THEN THE HOST BENT DOWN TO HIS EAR
IN A LITTLE TILBURY HARNESSED TO A WHITE HORSE COLD AS THE WEATHER WAS THAT HE HAD GONE ALONE WITHOUT EVEN A DRIVER THAT NO ONE KNEW WHAT ROAD HE HAD TAKEN THAT PEOPLE SAID HE HAD BEEN SEEN TO TURN INTO THE ROAD TO ARRAS
AND IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT WE HAVE STUDIED THIS EAGLE
THE TENTH OF AUGUST ELECTRIFIES THEM
THE IDEA THAT MAKES TWO NAPOLEONS WHERE DO THEY THINK I AM TO GET THEM THESE PEASANTS ARE STUPID TRULY NEVERTHELESS SHE WENT TO A DORMER WINDOW IN THE STAIRCASE AND READ THE LETTER ONCE MORE
OR AS IT OFTEN HAPPENS IN BOTH AT ONCE ARE BUT SLOWLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE THINGS OF ACTUAL LIFE THEIR OWN DESTINY IS A FAR OFF THING TO THEM THERE RESULTS FROM SUCH CONCENTRATION A PASSIVITY WHICH
JEAN VALJEAN WAS PRONOUNCED GUILTY THE TERMS OF THE CODE WERE EXPLICIT THERE OCCUR FORMIDABLE HOURS IN OUR CIVILIZATION THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THE PENAL LAWS DECREE A SHIPWRECK
IT IS NIGHT ALL THE HOUSES ARE SHUT HE DOES NOT ENTER THE INN AND HE IS NOT TO BE FOUND SO HE HAS DIVED THROUGH THE EARTH THE MAN HAD NOT PLUNGED INTO THE EARTH BUT HE HAD GONE WITH GREAT STRIDES THROUGH THE DARK DOWN THE PRINCIPAL STREET OF CHELLES
WITH WHICH NO ONE PARTY HAD ANY RIGHT TO REPROACH THE REST FOR IT HAS BEEN APPLIED BY THE REPUBLIC IN AMERICA AS WELL AS BY THE MONARCHY IN EUROPE THIS LYNCH LAW WAS COMPLICATED WITH MISTAKES ON ONE DAY OF RIOTING A YOUNG POET NAMED PAUL AIME GARNIER
AN AILING CHESTNUT TREE BANDAGED WITH A SHEET OF ZINC NAILED DIRECTLY UPON THE BARK
HE DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION HE IS A MAN WHO DOES GOOD BY GUN SHOTS SAID COMBEFERRE THOSE WHO HAVE PRESERVED SOME MEMORY OF THIS ALREADY DISTANT EPOCH KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM THE SUBURBS WAS VALIANT AGAINST INSURRECTIONS
THE INSTANT THAT MADELEINE'S GLANCE ENCOUNTERED JAVERT'S GLANCE JAVERT WITHOUT STIRRING WITHOUT MOVING FROM HIS POST WITHOUT APPROACHING HIM BECAME TERRIBLE
THENARDIER THRUST HIS FIST INTO A LARGE POCKET CONCEALED UNDER HIS BLOUSE DREW OUT A ROPE AND OFFERED IT TO JEAN VALJEAN HOLD ON SAID HE
WHO STRETCHES HERSELF WHEN SHE WAKES
THEIR GREAT HORSES REARED STRODE ACROSS THE RANKS LEAPED OVER THE BAYONETS AND FELL GIGANTIC IN THE MIDST OF THESE FOUR LIVING WELLS
A SORT OF HIRED MAN OF LETTERS
EXECUTED THENARDIER'S ORDER WHEN THE PRISONER'S RIGHT ARM WAS FREE THENARDIER DIPPED THE PEN IN THE INK AND PRESENTED IT TO HIM UNDERSTAND THOROUGHLY SIR THAT YOU ARE IN OUR POWER AT OUR DISCRETION
THIS TERRORIST THIS SEPTEMBRIST WOULD RETURN BUT THE WEEKS PASSED BY
HER WEDDING BASKET SEEMED TO HER TO BE UPHELD BY SERAPHIM
THIS REPRESSION WAS NOT EFFECTED WITHOUT SOME COMMOTION AND WITHOUT THAT TUMULTUOUS UPROAR PECULIAR TO COLLISIONS BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE
AS SHE RAN SHE FELT LIKE CRYING THE NOCTURNAL QUIVERING OF THE FOREST SURROUNDED HER COMPLETELY SHE NO LONGER THOUGHT SHE NO LONGER SAW THE IMMENSITY OF NIGHT WAS FACING THIS TINY CREATURE
AND JUST AS SOON AS YOU HAVE HANDED OVER TO ME THOSE LITTLE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS SHE WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU IF YOU HAVE ME ARRESTED MY COMRADE WILL GIVE A TURN OF HIS THUMB TO THE LARK THAT'S ALL
THIS IS WHAT THAT INSTITUTION WAS LIKE GREECE STOOD IN NEED OF THE CHARIOT OF THESPIS FRANCE STANDS IN NEED OF THE HACKNEY COACH OF VADE EVERYTHING CAN BE PARODIED EVEN PARODY THE SATURNALIA
FOUR HOURS FOR FIVE LEAGUES AT SAINT POL HE HAD THE HORSE UNHARNESSED AT THE FIRST INN HE CAME TO AND LED TO THE STABLE AS HE HAD PROMISED SCAUFFLAIRE
I KNOW NOT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME
A MYSTERIOUS CHILDHOOD IS ALWAYS PREPARED FOR CERTAIN RENUNCIATIONS
THEN HE BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE GRATING ON TIPTOE AND BAREFOOTED MAKING JEAN VALJEAN A SIGN TO FOLLOW HIM LOOKED OUT LAID HIS FINGER ON HIS MOUTH AND REMAINED FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AS THOUGH IN SUSPENSE
IF IT WERE THE OUTCOME OF REASONING WOULD RESEMBLE PHILOSOPHY ONE DECLINES DESCENDS TRICKLES AWAY EVEN CRUMBLES AWAY AND YET IS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF IT ONE'S SELF IT ALWAYS ENDS IT IS TRUE IN AN AWAKENING
THAT THE LITTLE GIRLS SPILLED IT ON THEIR APRONS AND DOWN THEIR NECKS IF THEIR MOTHER HAD KNOWN OF THIS MARAUDING SHE WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THE DELINQUENTS SEVERELY JEAN VALJEAN GRUFFLY AND GRUMBLINGLY PAID MARIE CLAUDE FOR THE PINT OF MILK BEHIND THEIR MOTHER'S BACK
FOR HIM COSETTE WAS A PERFUME AND NOT A WOMAN HE INHALED HER SHE REFUSED NOTHING AND HE ASKED NOTHING COSETTE WAS HAPPY AND MARIUS WAS SATISFIED
HE IS THE DISGRACE OF MY FAMILY SAID THE OLD BOURGEOIS HE TOOK AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF SNUFF AND HAD A PARTICULARLY GRACEFUL MANNER OF PLUCKING AT HIS LACE RUFFLE WITH THE BACK OF ONE HAND HE BELIEVED VERY LITTLE IN GOD
WHITHER WAS HE GOING HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHY WAS HE HASTENING HE DID NOT KNOW HE WAS DRIVING AT RANDOM STRAIGHT AHEAD WHITHER
HE HAS THE ATTENTION OF EVERY ONE IN THE BUILDING AND THIS ATTENTION HE CLOSELY HOLDS TILL HE IS THROUGH YET IT IS NEVER BY A STRIKING EFFORT THAT ATTENTION IS GAINED EXCEPT IN SO FAR
IF WE ARE TO HAVE A BOULEVARD TALK IT DOWN IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE BETTER SCHOOLS TALK THEM DOWN IF YOU WISH TO HAVE WISE LEGISLATION TALK IT DOWN TALK ALL THE PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS DOWN
HE CALLED HIM IN ONE DAY TO MAKE FUN OF HIM AND SAID RASTUS I HEAR THAT ALL THE REST OF YOUR COMPANY ARE KILLED AND WHY ARE YOU NOT KILLED RASTUS WINKED AT HIM AND SAID
I HAVE COME NOW TO THE APEX OF MY THOUGHT I HAVE COME NOW TO THE HEART OF THE WHOLE MATTER AND TO THE CENTER OF MY STRUGGLE WHY ISN'T PHILADELPHIA A GREATER CITY IN ITS GREATER WEALTH
BUT WE DO NOT SO TEACH WE ARE NOW TEACHING EVERYWHERE THAT THE GENERALS DO ALL THE FIGHTING I REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE WAR I WENT DOWN TO SEE GENERAL ROBERT E LEE THAT
AND AT TIMES THERE ARE CHIMING BELLS HIS MUSICAL TASTE SEEMS TO TEND TOWARD THE THUNDEROUS OR PERHAPS
HIS FUND OF PERSONAL ANECDOTE OR PERSONAL REMINISCENCE IS CONSTANT AND ILLUSTRATIVE
AND SOMETHING IN HIS EARNESTNESS MADE HIM WIN A TEMPORARY APPOINTMENT THEREUPON HE WORKED AND STUDIED SO HARD AND SO DEVOTEDLY WHILE HE DAILY TAUGHT THAT WITHIN A FEW MONTHS HE WAS REGULARLY EMPLOYED THERE AND NOW SAYS CONWELL ABRUPTLY
THE PLACE FOR THE OFFICER IN ACTUAL BATTLE IS BEHIND THE LINE
BREAKS QUIETLY IN WITH SUCH A NUMBER GIVING IT DAUPHIN STREET QUIETLY AND IN A LOW TONE YET EVERY ONE IN THE CHURCH HEARS DISTINCTLY EVERY SYLLABLE OF THAT LOW VOICE
HIS FACE LIGHTED AS HE SPOKE THERE IS SUCH A FASCINATION IN IT HE EXCLAIMED
WHEN WHEN THERE COMES A GREAT WAR WHEN WE GET INTO DIFFICULTY THROUGH WATCHFUL WAITING IN MEXICO WHEN WE
OF EVERY READER OF THIS BOOK JUST AS HE WOULD USE THE NAME OF IT
SOME QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO CONWELL PUBLISHED A LITTLE BOOK FOR STUDENTS ON THE STUDY AND PRACTICE OF ORATORY THAT CLEAR CUT ARTICULATION IS THE CHARM OF ELOQUENCE IS ONE OF HIS INSISTED UPON STATEMENTS
SHOUTING TO MY TROOPS COME ON I NEVER DID IT DO YOU SUPPOSE I WOULD GET IN FRONT OF MY MEN TO BE SHOT IN FRONT BY THE ENEMY AND IN THE BACK BY MY OWN MEN THAT IS NO PLACE FOR AN OFFICER
DON'T YOU EXAGGERATE THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE BUT I AM HERE FOR THE LESSON AND NOT FOR THE STORY AND THIS IS THE WAY IT WENT FELLOW CITIZENS
THE REALITIES ARE LIKE DREAMS TO ME BLESSINGS ON THE LOVING HEARTS AND NOBLE MINDS WHO HAVE BEEN SO WILLING TO SACRIFICE FOR OTHERS GOOD AND TO THINK ONLY OF WHAT THEY COULD DO AND NEVER OF WHAT THEY SHOULD GET
THERE ARE GOING TO BE GREAT MEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN PHILADELPHIA
JUST AS HOWELLS WAS SO LONG AGO TOLD THAT HE DID IN LEXINGTON AND THERE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN HAPPINESS THERE IS A SENSE OF EASE OF COMFORT OF GENERAL JOY THAT IS QUITE UNMISTAKABLE THERE IS NOTHING OF STIFFNESS OR CONSTRAINT
HE WAS SO FAMILIAR SO
NEW YORK SAINT LOUIS AND SAN FRANCISCO DO
BUT I WANT TO SAVE HIM FROM BITTERNESS AND EACH CHECK WILL HELP AND TOO
HE MET LAST MONTH OR LAST YEAR OR TEN YEARS AGO IN OHIO IN CALIFORNIA IN LONDON IN PARIS IN NEW YORK IN BOMBAY AND EACH MEMORY EACH ILLUSTRATION IS A HAMMER WITH WHICH HE DRIVES HOME A TRUTH
WHEN HE IS THROUGH YOU DO NOT REMEMBER THAT HE HAS MADE ANY GESTURES AT ALL BUT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE REMAINS WITH YOU AND THE LOOK OF HIS WONDERFUL EYES AND THOUGH HE IS PAST THE THREESCORE YEARS AND TEN
COMMENCEMENTS DEBATES CATTLE SHOWS AND SEWING CIRCLES WITHOUT PARTIALITY AND WITHOUT PRICE FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS THE INCOME WAS ALL EXPERIENCE THEN VOLUNTARY GIFTS
THE OLD TIME RELIGION GARFIELD ESPECIALLY LOVED IT SO HE TOLD US BECAUSE THE GOOD OLD MAN WHO BROUGHT HIM UP AS A BOY AND TO WHOM HE OWED SUCH GRATITUDE USED TO SING IT
THE LECTURE IS VIBRANT WITH HIS ENERGY IT FLASHES WITH HIS HOPEFULNESS
THERE WERE MANY SAD FAILURES AND TEARS BUT IT WAS A RESTFUL COMPROMISE WITH MY CONSCIENCE CONCERNING THE MINISTRY AND IT PLEASED MY FRIENDS I ADDRESSED PICNICS SUNDAY SCHOOLS PATRIOTIC MEETINGS FUNERALS ANNIVERSARIES
A GENIAL APPRECIATION OF THE FUN OF IT
AT THE PASTURE BARS OUTSIDE OF THE BOY'S WINDOW EVERY MORNING AND YOUNG JIM KNEW
FOOTNOTE TWO DOCTOR CONWELL WAS LIVING AND ACTIVELY AT WORK WHEN THESE PAGES WERE WRITTEN IT IS THEREFORE A MUCH TRUER PICTURE OF HIS PERSONALITY THAN ANYTHING WRITTEN IN THE PAST TENSE FOOTNOTE THREE THIS INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE
WHEN THEY HAD THE SECOND FUNERAL I WAS INVITED AMONG OTHERS AND WENT OUT TO SEE THAT SAME COFFIN PUT BACK IN THE TOMB AT SPRINGFIELD AROUND THE TOMB STOOD LINCOLN'S OLD NEIGHBORS TO WHOM HE WAS JUST OLD ABE
TO THIS DEFINITE PURPOSE HE HAS WHAT MAY BE TERMED A WAITING LIST ON THAT LIST ARE VERY FEW CASES HE HAS LOOKED INTO PERSONALLY INFINITELY BUSY MAN THAT HE IS HE CANNOT DO EXTENSIVE PERSONAL INVESTIGATION
AND I TELL THEM THAT I AM HOPING TO LEAVE BEHIND ME MEN WHO WILL DO MORE WORK THAN I HAVE DONE DON'T THINK THAT I PUT IN TOO MUCH ADVICE HE ADDED WITH A SMILE FOR I ONLY TRY TO LET THEM KNOW THAT A FRIEND IS TRYING TO HELP THEM
TO THE LITTLE AUDIENCE IN WESTFIELD MASSACHUSETTS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
AND RESPECT OF HIS HOME CITY WAS SEEN NOT ONLY IN THE THOUSANDS WHO STROVE TO HEAR HIM BUT IN THE PROMINENT MEN WHO SERVED ON THE LOCAL COMMITTEE IN CHARGE OF THE CELEBRATION THERE WAS A NATIONAL COMMITTEE TOO
NO TOWN OFFICER EVER TOOK ANY NOTICE OF ME BEFORE I WENT TO WAR EXCEPT TO ADVISE THE TEACHER TO THRASH ME AND NOW I WAS INVITED UP ON THE STAND WITH THE TOWN OFFICERS OH MY
AND HOW THE CHOIR THEMSELVES LIKE IT THEY OCCUPY A GREAT CURVING SPACE BEHIND THE PULPIT
THERE IS ONLY ONE ANSWER AND THAT IS BECAUSE OUR OWN PEOPLE TALK DOWN THEIR OWN CITY IF THERE EVER WAS A COMMUNITY ON EARTH THAT HAS TO BE FORCED AHEAD IT IS THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA
SOME OF YOU SAW THE PROCESSION GO UP BROAD STREET I WAS AWAY BUT THE FAMILY WROTE TO ME THAT THE TALLY HO COACH WITH LIEUTENANT HOBSON UPON IT
BUT THAT WOULD BE A MISTAKE I WAS WITH ELIAS HOWE IN THE CIVIL WAR AND HE OFTEN USED TO TELL ME
WHY DOES NEW YORK EXCEL PHILADELPHIA PEOPLE SAY BECAUSE OF HER HARBOR WHY DO MANY OTHER CITIES OF THE UNITED STATES GET AHEAD OF PHILADELPHIA NOW
YET I DID NOT MISS A SINGLE ENGAGEMENT SOMETIMES I HAD TO HIRE A SPECIAL TRAIN BUT I REACHED THE TOWN ON TIME WITH ONLY A RARE EXCEPTION AND THEN I WAS BUT A FEW MINUTES LATE ACCIDENTS HAVE PRECEDED
MAGNIFICENT CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN OF WHOM BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH ARE NOW PROUD AS ONE OF OUR GREAT AMERICANS THE GENERAL TOLD ME ABOUT HIS SERVANT RASTUS WHO WAS AN ENLISTED COLORED SOLDIER
THE SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE AND THE BIBLE SAYS THE SERVANT CANNOT BE GREATER THAN THE MASTER THE BIBLE SAYS HE THAT IS SENT
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING THE MOST REMARKABLE THING IN RUSSELL CONWELL'S REMARKABLE LIFE IS HIS LECTURE ACRES OF DIAMONDS THAT IS THE LECTURE ITSELF THE NUMBER OF TIMES HE HAS DELIVERED IT WHAT A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION IT HAS BEEN TO MYRIADS
FOR IT WAS A LARGE AUDIENCE THAT CAME TO LISTEN TO HIM HARDLY A SEAT IN THE GREAT AUDITORIUM WAS VACANT AND IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT ALTHOUGH IT WAS IN HIS OWN CHURCH IT WAS NOT A FREE LECTURE WHERE A THRONG MIGHT BE EXPECTED
YET OUT OF THOSE HUMILIATIONS CAME A MARVELOUS RESULT I DETERMINED HE SAYS THAT WHATEVER I COULD DO TO MAKE THE WAY EASIER AT COLLEGE FOR OTHER YOUNG MEN WORKING THEIR WAY I WOULD DO AND SO MANY YEARS AGO HE BEGAN TO
THE PEOPLE FEEL THAT HE IS HIMSELF A FERVIDLY EARNEST MAN
THE PEOPLE RULE OR SHOULD RULE AND IF THEY DO WE DO NOT NEED THE GREATER MEN IN OFFICE IF THE GREAT MEN IN AMERICA TOOK OUR OFFICES WE WOULD CHANGE TO AN EMPIRE IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS
HE TOLD ME OF IT ONE EVENING AND HIS VOICE SANK LOWER AND LOWER AS HE WENT FAR BACK INTO THE PAST IT WAS OF HIS DAYS AT YALE THAT HE SPOKE FOR THEY WERE DAYS OF SUFFERING FOR HE HAD NOT MONEY FOR YALE AND IN WORKING
FOR THE UPLIFT OF HUMANITY HAS MADE LIFE A CONTINUAL SURPRISE WHILE THE SAMARITAN HOSPITAL'S AMAZING GROWTH
THEN HE ASKED ME WERE YOU BROUGHT UP ON A FARM I SAID YES IN THE BERKSHIRE HILLS OF MASSACHUSETTS HE THEN THREW HIS LEG OVER THE CORNER OF THE BIG CHAIR AND SAID I HAVE HEARD
WHEN I HAD GOT SEATED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SELECTMEN AROSE AND CAME FORWARD TO THE TABLE AND WE ALL SUPPOSED HE WOULD INTRODUCE THE CONGREGATIONAL MINISTER WHO WAS THE ONLY ORATOR IN TOWN AND THAT HE WOULD GIVE THE ORATION TO THE RETURNING SOLDIERS
I WROTE THE BIOGRAPHY OF ONE OF THE GRANDEST MEN OF THE NATION AND YET HE WAS JUST THE SAME OLD JIM TO HIS NEIGHBOR IF YOU KNOW A GREAT MAN IN PHILADELPHIA AND YOU SHOULD MEET HIM TO MORROW YOU WOULD SAY
WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE HOUSEKEEPING A DULL WITTED GIRL NAMED ELIZA STOUGHTON WHO MADE BEDS AND HELPED WITH THE MILKING A BOY WHO WORKED IN THE STABLES AND JESSE BENTLEY HIMSELF THE OWNER AND OVERLORD OF IT ALL
AT AN INCREASED SALARY AND SENT TO AN OFFICE AT COLUMBUS OHIO THERE HE SETTLED DOWN WITH HIS YOUNG WIFE AND BEGAN BUYING A HOUSE ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN THE YOUNG TELEGRAPH OPERATOR WAS MADLY IN LOVE
AND SMALL BOYS RACED ALONG THE SIDEWALK DIVING BETWEEN THE LEGS OF MEN YOUNG MEN WITH SHINING RED FACES WALKED AWKWARDLY ABOUT WITH GIRLS ON THEIR ARMS IN A ROOM ABOVE ONE OF THE STORES WHERE A DANCE WAS TO BE HELD
HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE FARM NIGHT AND DAY AND THAT MADE HIM SUCCESSFUL
TRYING PERHAPS TO REMEMBER WHICH ONE OF THEIR MALE ACQUAINTANCES THE THING IN SOME FAINT WAY RESEMBLES HAD YOU BEEN IN THE EARLIER YEARS OF YOUR LIFE A CITIZEN OF THE VILLAGE OF WINESBURG OHIO
AND HE FELT GROWN UP THE MOOD THAT HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIM WAS A THING KNOWN TO MEN AND UNKNOWN TO BOYS HE FELT OLD AND A LITTLE TIRED
THE MAN DID NOT LOOK LIKE HIS GRANDFATHER THE CONVICTION THAT SOMETHING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE HAD HAPPENED THAT BY SOME MIRACLE A NEW AND DANGEROUS PERSON HAD COME INTO THE BODY OF THE KINDLY OLD MAN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
AND WHEN NOT ANGRY SHE WAS OFTEN MOROSE AND SILENT IN WINESBURG IT WAS SAID THAT SHE DRANK HER HUSBAND THE BANKER
DIFFERENT WITH HIM LOUISE TURNED AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING THE TWO MEN TO SIT IN EMBARRASSED SILENCE AS VERY OFTEN HAPPENED SHE LATER STAYED IN HER ROOM FOR DAYS
AND WHAT THERE IS OF A REFLECTIVE TENDENCY IN HIS NATURE IS INTENSIFIED ONE SHUDDERS AT THE THOUGHT OF THE MEANINGLESSNESS OF LIFE
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MEN A LITTLE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WOMEN THEY ARE SENT TO PREVENT MEN MAKING THE WORLD WORTH WHILE IT IS A TRICK IN NATURE UGH THEY ARE CREEPING CRAWLING SQUIRMING THINGS
INTO ANOTHER ROAD AND GETTING UPON HIS KNEES FELT OF THE SOFT GROUND WITH HIS FINGERS BUT FOR THE FIGURE OF HIS GRANDFATHER WHOM HE WAS AFRAID HE WOULD NEVER FIND IN THE DARKNESS HE THOUGHT THE WORLD MUST BE ALTOGETHER EMPTY
THE RUNNING OF THE FARM AS IT HAD NEVER BEEN RUN BEFORE WAS EASY FOR HIM WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM CLEVELAND WHERE HE HAD BEEN IN SCHOOL HE SHUT HIMSELF OFF FROM ALL OF HIS PEOPLE AND BEGAN TO MAKE PLANS
AND HE AWOKE TO FIND THE OLD MAN'S HAND STROKING HIS HEAD TENDERLY THAT THE TERROR LEFT HIM
IN THE COMPLETENESS OF HIS UGLINESS HE ACHIEVED A KIND OF PERVERTED BEAUTY CHILDREN STOPPING BEFORE THE CAGE ARE FASCINATED MEN TURN AWAY WITH AN AIR OF DISGUST AND WOMEN LINGER FOR A MOMENT
WHEN HIS CRIES WERE HEARD BY A FARMER WHO WAS WALKING HOME FROM TOWN AND HE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE HE WAS SO TIRED AND EXCITED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIM BY CHANCE DAVID'S FATHER KNEW THAT HE HAD DISAPPEARED
HE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO GO THROUGH THE FRIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE A THOUSAND TIMES TO BE SURE OF FINDING AT THE END OF THE LONG BLACK ROAD A THING SO LOVELY AS HIS MOTHER HAD SUDDENLY BECOME
THE MOST PEACEFUL AND LOVELY THING HE HAD EVER SEEN
SPEECHES HE HAD THOUGHT OUT CAME INTO HIS HEAD BUT THEY SEEMED UTTERLY POINTLESS I THOUGHT I USED TO THINK I HAD IT IN MY MIND YOU WOULD MARRY SETH RICHMOND
BY THE TIME THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR HAD BEEN OVER FOR TWENTY YEARS THAT PART OF NORTHERN OHIO WHERE THE BENTLEY FARMS LAY HAD BEGUN TO EMERGE FROM PIONEER LIFE
IN SPITE OF HIS YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE JESSE HAD THE TRICK OF MASTERING THE SOULS OF HIS PEOPLE
BUT HE DID NOT WANT AT THE MOMENT TO BE CONFUSED BY HER WOMANHOOD IN THE DARKNESS HE TOOK HOLD OF HER HAND AND WHEN SHE CREPT CLOSE PUT A HAND ON HER SHOULDER A WIND BEGAN TO BLOW
BUT LOUISE COULD NOT BE MADE HAPPY SHE FLEW INTO HALF INSANE FITS OF TEMPER DURING WHICH SHE WAS SOMETIMES SILENT SOMETIMES NOISY AND QUARRELSOME SHE SWORE AND CRIED OUT IN HER ANGER SHE GOT A KNIFE FROM THE KITCHEN AND THREATENED HER HUSBAND'S LIFE
WE WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO AN EARLIER DAY THE BENTLEY FAMILY HAD BEEN IN NORTHERN OHIO FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS BEFORE JESSE'S TIME THEY CAME FROM NEW YORK STATE AND TOOK UP LAND WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS NEW
THAT IS BECAUSE HE BELIEVES THAT A WOMAN WILL BE GENTLE THAT SHE WILL UNDERSTAND HE WANTS MOST OF ALL UNDERSTANDING WHEN THE MOMENT OF SOPHISTICATION CAME TO GEORGE WILLARD
AS A MATTER OF FACT JESSE'S WIFE DID SOON GO UNDER THAT WAS PERHAPS JESSE'S FAULT A FARM IN NORTHERN OHIO IN THE HARD YEARS AFTER THE CIVIL WAR WAS NO PLACE FOR A DELICATE WOMAN
AT EIGHTEEN HE HAD LEFT HOME TO GO TO SCHOOL TO BECOME A SCHOLAR AND EVENTUALLY TO BECOME A MINISTER OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH ALL THROUGH HIS BOYHOOD HE HAD BEEN WHAT IN OUR COUNTRY WAS CALLED AN ODD SHEEP
THE WARM UNTHINKING LITTLE ANIMAL STRUGGLES AGAINST THE THING THAT REFLECTS AND REMEMBERS AND THE OLDER THE MORE SOPHISTICATED THING
ONE OF THE INSTRUCTORS FROM THE COLLEGE WHO WAS A GUEST OF HER MOTHER'S THE YOUNG MAN WAS OF A PEDANTIC TURN OF MIND AND SHE FELT AT ONCE HE WOULD NOT DO FOR HER PURPOSE AT THE FAIR SHE WAS GLAD TO BE SEEN IN HIS COMPANY
WITH A SPADE I TURNED UP THE BLACK GROUND WHILE SHE RAN ABOUT
DURING THE LAST YEARS OF YOUNG DAVID'S BOYHOOD HE SAW HIS MOTHER BUT SELDOM AND SHE BECAME FOR HIM JUST A WOMAN WITH WHOM HE HAD ONCE LIVED STILL HE COULD NOT GET HER FIGURE OUT OF HIS MIND AND AS HE GREW OLDER IT BECAME MORE DEFINITE
THEY WERE DRESSED IN OVERALLS AND IN THE WINTER WORE HEAVY COATS THAT WERE FLECKED WITH MUD THEIR HANDS AS THEY STRETCHED THEM OUT TO THE HEAT OF THE STOVES WERE CRACKED AND RED IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO TALK
SHE REMEMBERED THE SUMMER EVENING WHEN THEY HAD WALKED TOGETHER AND WANTED TO WALK WITH HIM AGAIN SHE THOUGHT THAT THE MONTHS SHE HAD SPENT IN THE CITY
GEORGE WILLARD SAT BESIDE HELEN WHITE
SEEING AS THOUGH THEY MARCHED IN PROCESSION BEFORE HIM THE COUNTLESS FIGURES OF MEN WHO BEFORE HIS TIME HAVE COME OUT OF NOTHINGNESS INTO THE WORLD LIVED THEIR LIVES AND AGAIN DISAPPEARED INTO NOTHINGNESS
IT WAS GOOD OF YOU MISSUS WHITE TO HAVE ME DOWN FOR THE DAY HE TURNED TO HELEN AND LAUGHED YOUR LIFE IS STILL BOUND UP WITH THE LIFE OF THIS TOWN HE ASKED
IT WAS SO THEY WENT DOWN THE HILL IN THE DARKNESS THEY PLAYED LIKE TWO SPLENDID YOUNG THINGS IN A YOUNG WORLD ONCE RUNNING SWIFTLY FORWARD HELEN TRIPPED GEORGE AND HE FELL
HE TORE IT UP AND LAUGHED UNPLEASANTLY FOR SOME REASON HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN WIFE AS HE TORE UP THE LETTER WASH WILLIAMS ONCE HAD A WIFE WHEN HE WAS STILL A YOUNG MAN HE MARRIED A WOMAN AT DAYTON OHIO
EVERYWHERE ON ALL SIDES THE SENSE OF CROWDING MOVING LIFE CLOSED IN ABOUT HIM HE WANTED TO RUN AWAY BY HIMSELF AND THINK IF SHE WANTS TO STAY WITH THAT FELLOW SHE MAY
AND SAT ON A PILE OF DECAYING RAILROAD TIES BESIDE THE TRACKS IT WAS THEN THAT THE OPERATOR TOLD THE YOUNG REPORTER HIS STORY OF HATE PERHAPS A DOZEN TIMES
INTERMINGLED WITH STRINGS OF VILE CURSES THE OPERATOR HAD MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A DENTIST WHO WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THREE SISTERS ON HIS MARRIAGE DAY BECAUSE OF HIS ABILITY HE WAS PROMOTED TO A POSITION AS DISPATCHER
ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS THEY HITCHED A TEAM OF HORSES TO A THREE SEATED WAGON AND WENT OFF TO TOWN IN TOWN THEY STOOD ABOUT THE STOVES IN THE STORES TALKING TO OTHER FARMERS OR TO THE STORE KEEPERS
THERE WERE ALWAYS THREE OR FOUR OLD PEOPLE SITTING ON THE FRONT PORCH OF THE HOUSE OR PUTTERING ABOUT THE GARDEN OF THE BENTLEY FARM THREE OF THE OLD PEOPLE WERE WOMEN AND SISTERS TO JESSE
THERE IS SOMETHING MEMORABLE IN THE EXPERIENCE TO BE HAD BY GOING INTO A FAIR GROUND THAT STANDS AT THE EDGE OF A MIDDLE WESTERN TOWN
AND HE LOST THE HALF TIMID HESITATING MANNER HE HAD ALWAYS HAD WITH HIS PEOPLE AT NIGHT WHEN HE WENT TO BED AFTER A LONG DAY OF ADVENTURES IN THE STABLES IN THE FIELDS OR DRIVING ABOUT FROM FARM TO FARM WITH HIS GRANDFATHER HE WANTED TO EMBRACE EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE
AND TURNED THE GREAT KEY IN THE LOCK JUST AS JAKIN SPRANG TO THE INSIDE OF THE DOOR
LITTLE GIRLS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD YOU KIDS MUST LEARN NOT TO MAKE YOURSELVES A NUISANCE RUN ALONG HOME NOW AND PERHAPS IF YOU'RE GOOD I'LL GIVE YOU EACH A PENNY TO MORROW LOOK HERE SAID CYRIL IN THE BEST MAN TO MAN TONE AT HIS COMMAND
SHE HAD A WHITE TOWEL TIED TO A WALKING STICK THIS WAS A FLAG OF TRUCE AND SHE WAVED IT IN THE HOPE THAT THE INDIANS WOULD KNOW WHAT IT WAS APPARENTLY THEY DID FOR ONE WHO WAS BROWNER THAN THE OTHERS STEPPED FORWARD
YOUR BIKE'S RUN DOWN SAID ROBERT WONDERING HOW HE COULD SO SOON HAVE LEARNED TO DECEIVE SO IT IS SAID CYRIL IT'S A PUNCTURE SAID ANTHEA STOOPING DOWN AND STANDING UP AGAIN WITH A THORN WHICH SHE HAD GOT READY FOR THE PURPOSE LOOK HERE
SO THAT THEY KEPT RED FOR THE REST OF THE DAY AND STARTED TO TELL THE BOYS BUT JUST AT THAT MOMENT COOK RANG THE DINNER BELL AND NOTHING COULD BE SAID TILL THEY HAD ALL BEEN HELPED TO MINCED BEEF THEN COOK LEFT THE ROOM AND ANTHEA TOLD HER TALE
AND SAT DOWN FLAT ON THE CARPET OH PUSSY HOW AWFUL IT WAS INDIANS HE WISHED FOR CYRIL AT BREAKFAST DON'T YOU REMEMBER HE SAID I WISH THERE WERE RED INDIANS IN ENGLAND AND NOW THERE ARE
SO YOU'VE FORGOTTEN SAID THE PSAMMEAD BEGINNING TO BURROW NEVER MIND YOU'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH AND I WISH YOU JOY OF IT A NICE THING YOU'VE LET YOURSELVES IN FOR WE ALWAYS DO SOMEHOW SAID JANE SADLY
I'M GOING TO BREAK SOMETHING AND YOU MUST LET ME HAVE EVERY PENNY OF MONEY YOU'VE GOT THE INDIANS WILL COME HERE DON'T YOU SEE THAT SPITEFUL PSAMMEAD AS GOOD AS SAID SO YOU SEE WHAT MY PLAN IS COME ON JANE DID NOT SEE AT ALL
THAT ONLY THAT VERY MORNING HE HAD BEEN A CHUBBY CHILD OF TWO YEARS BREAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S WATERBURY WATCHES DEVEREUX AS HE OUGHT TO BE CALLED FOR THE FUTURE TOOK OUT A GOLD WATCH WHEN HE HAD MENDED THE LADY'S BICYCLE AND ALL THE ONLOOKERS BEHIND THE PIG PAIL SAID OH
I BELIEVE IT'S THE FINE DAY THEN WHY DID THE SAMMYADD SAY WE'D LET OURSELVES IN FOR A NICE THING ASKED ANTHEA SHE WAS FEELING VERY CROSS SHE KNEW SHE HAD ACTED WITH NOBILITY AND DISCRETION
IT REPLIED POLITELY AND NOW WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU IT SAID I SUPPOSE YOU'VE COME HERE SO EARLY TO ASK FOR SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF
IT WASN'T SAID JANE BRIEFLY WHY IF IT WAS INDIANS CYRIL WENT ON SALT PLEASE AND MUSTARD I MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE THIS MUSH GO DOWN IF IT WAS INDIANS THEY'D HAVE BEEN INFESTING THE PLACE LONG BEFORE THIS YOU KNOW THEY WOULD
SHE CARRIED IT INTO THE DRESSING ROOM AND CAREFULLY EMPTIED THE WATER OUT OF IT INTO THE BATH THEN SHE TOOK THE JUG BACK INTO THE BEDROOM AND DROPPED IT ON THE FLOOR YOU KNOW HOW A JUG ALWAYS BREAKS IF YOU HAPPEN TO DROP IT BY ACCIDENT
AND AFTER THAT IT WAS VERY HARD TO BE CALLED A LITTLE SILLY ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE HAD THE WEIGHT OF A BURGLARED MISSIONARY BOX AND ABOUT SEVEN AND FOURPENCE MOSTLY IN COPPERS LYING LIKE LEAD UPON HER CONSCIENCE
THE INDIANS HAD FORMED A RING ROUND THE CHILDREN AND NOW SAT ON THE GROUND GAZING AT THEIR CAPTIVES THERE WAS A THREATENING SILENCE THEN SLOWLY BY TWOS AND THREES THE INDIANS WHO HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR FIREWOOD CAME BACK AND THEY CAME BACK EMPTY HANDED
WHILE JANE HUGGED HER MISERABLY AND SAID AT FIVE SECOND INTERVALS DON'T CRY PANTHER DEAR THEN SHE JUMPED UP RUBBED HER EYES HARD WITH THE CORNER OF HER PINAFORE
BISCUITS THREE WHOLE ONES AND A GENEROUS HANDFUL OF CRUMBS AND FRAGMENTS I GOT THEM THIS MORNING COOK AND I'D QUITE FORGOTTEN HE EXPLAINED AS HE DIVIDED THEM WITH SCRUPULOUS FAIRNESS INTO FOUR HEAPS
HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE INDEED RATHER DIRTY BECAUSE EARLIER IN THE DAY THE LAMB IN HIS INFANT STATE HAD SPRINKLED A GOOD DEAL OF GARDEN SOIL OVER THEM THE GROWN UP LAMB'S VOICE WAS SO TYRANT LIKE AS JANE SAID AFTERWARDS THAT THEY ACTUALLY RETREATED TO THE BACK GARDEN
THE GARRISON WAS WELL PROVISIONED TILL SUNDOWN THEY BROUGHT UP SOME IRON POTS OF COLD WATER TO POUR ON THE BESIEGERS INSTEAD OF HOT LEAD WITH WHICH THE CASTLE DID NOT SEEM TO BE PROVIDED
SO A HEAP OF STONES GREW APACE UP IN THE ROOM ABOVE THE GATE AND ANOTHER HEAP A SHINY SPIKY DANGEROUS LOOKING HEAP OF DAGGERS AND KNIVES
THEN IF WE HAD THE MUTTON IT WOULD BE REAL SAID ROBERT OH DON'T I WISH WE COULD FIND IT BUT WE CAN'T FIND IT I SUPPOSE IT ISN'T OURS TILL WE'VE GOT IT IN OUR MOUTHS
I'D GIVE SOMETHING FOR A JOLLY GOOD BOILING KETTLE OF LEAD
AND WHEN EVEN IMMERSION IN A WASH HAND BASIN HAD FAILED TO WASH THE MOULD FROM THE WORKS AND MAKE THE WATCH GO AGAIN CYRIL HAD SAID SEVERAL THINGS IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT BUT NOW HE WAS CALMER AND HAD EVEN CONSENTED TO CARRY THE LAMB PART OF THE WAY TO THE WOODS
YOU'RE VERY KIND SAID THE LADY LOOKING AT THE LAMB SHE LOOKED RATHER SHY BUT AS THE BOYS PUT IT THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY NONSENSE ABOUT HER BUT OH WHISPERED CYRIL BEHIND THE PIG PAIL I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE'D HAD ENOUGH BICYCLE MENDING FOR ONE DAY
GET THE COLOURED BLANKETS OFF OUR BEDS AND LOOK SLIPPY CAN'T YOU IT IS WONDERFUL HOW LIKE AN INDIAN YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELVES WITH BLANKETS AND FEATHERS AND COLOURED SCARVES
GO AWAY LITTLE GIRL SAID SAINT MAUR AS WE WILL NOW CALL HIM IN A TERRIBLE VOICE GO HOME AT ONCE YOU'D MUCH BETTER NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM THE NOW RECKLESS ANTHEA WENT ON HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO HE IS HE'S SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU THINK HE IS
INTO THE MOAT WATER IN ANOTHER MOMENT ROBERT WAS OUTSIDE THE LITTLE ROOM
I SELDOM PLAY
CYRIL SPOKE GRAVELY HILARY OLD CHAP HE SAID YOU MUST HAVE HAD A SUNSTROKE OR SOMETHING AND THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN SAYING TO THAT LADY WHY IF WE WERE TO TELL YOU THE THINGS YOU'VE SAID WHEN YOU ARE YOURSELF AGAIN SAY TO MORROW MORNING YOU WOULDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THEM LET ALONE BELIEVE THEM
I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T LAST THROUGH THE DAY WITHOUT GETTING UP TO SOME DOGGERY A PERSON CAN'T TAKE A BREATH OF AIR ON THE FRONT DOORSTEP BUT YOU MUST BE EMPTYING THE WASH HAND JUG ON TO THEIR HEADS OFF YOU GO TO BED THE LOT OF YOU
I SAY THERE ARE LOTS OF STONES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COURTYARD IF WE TOOK SOME OF THOSE UP JUST TO DROP ON THEIR HEADS
AND CAUGHT THE LAMB I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO SAY HILARY BY THE ARM THE OTHERS FOLLOWED AND IN AN INSTANT THE FOUR DIRTY CHILDREN WERE VISIBLE BEYOND DISGUISE DON'T LET HIM SAID ANTHEA TO THE LADY AND SHE SPOKE WITH INTENSE EARNESTNESS HE'S NOT FIT TO GO WITH ANYONE
FOR NOBODY LOOKS NICE PICKING UP SLICES OF SUET PUDDING FROM THE TABLE IN ITS MOUTH LIKE A DOG THE GREAT THING AFTER ALL
HEAVY FEET AND THE CLANK OF STEEL NO ONE BREATHED FOR A MOMENT THE STEEL
THEY KNEW BUT TOO WELL THAT FOR THEM THERE WAS NOTHING THERE BUT TABLE SUDDENLY CYRIL FELT IN HIS POCKET
SO THAT THEY WERE THE CENTRE OF A CROWD OF DARK CRUEL FACES IT'S NO GO WHISPERED ROBERT I KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE WE MUST MAKE A BOLT FOR THE PSAMMEAD IT MIGHT HELP US IF IT DOESN'T WELL
WHAT'S THE GIDDY HOUR YOU'LL BE LATE FOR YOUR GRUB I KNOW WE SHALL SAID ROBERT BITTERLY THEN CUT ALONG HOME SAID THE GROWN UP LAMB WHAT ABOUT YOUR GRUB THOUGH ASKED JANE
YE SEEK A POW WOW HE SAID IN EXCELLENT ENGLISH I AM GOLDEN EAGLE OF THE MIGHTY TRIBE OF ROCK DWELLERS AND I SAID ANTHEA WITH A SUDDEN INSPIRATION AM THE BLACK PANTHER
TWICE AND THEN OPENED HIS EYES
I DO THINK YOU'RE MOST BEASTLY UNKIND INDIANS ALMOST ALWAYS DO LURK REALLY THOUGH DON'T THEY PUT IN JANE ANXIOUS FOR PEACE NO THEY DON'T SAID CYRIL TARTLY AND I'M NOT UNKIND I'M ONLY TRUTHFUL
IF YOU HAPPEN TO DROP IT ON PURPOSE IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT ANTHEA DROPPED THAT JUG THREE TIMES AND IT WAS AS UNBROKEN AS EVER SO AT LAST SHE HAD TO TAKE HER FATHER'S BOOT TREE AND BREAK THE JUG WITH THAT IN COLD BLOOD
LYING FLAT ON THE FLOOR AND PUTTING ONE EYE TO THE LEAD HOLE OF COURSE THE HOLES GO STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE GATE HOUSE THAT'S FOR WHEN THE ENEMY HAS GOT PAST THE DOOR AND THE PORTCULLIS AND ALMOST ALL IS LOST HERE HAND ME THE POT
I'M JOLLY HUNGRY GOOD NIGHT KIDS GOOD NIGHT I HOPE THE CASTLE WON'T COME CREEPING BACK IN THE NIGHT SAID JANE OF COURSE IT WON'T SAID ANTHEA BRISKLY
ANYONE SHOULD FEEL FAINT IN STRESS OF BATTLE
AND DE TALBOT FOR EVER ALL SUDDENLY STOPPED AND WENT OUT LIKE THE SNUFF OF A CANDLE THE LITTLE DARK ROOM SEEMED TO WHIRL ROUND AND TURN TOPSY TURVY AND WHEN THE CHILDREN CAME TO THEMSELVES
WHICH WARNED HIM OF THE APPROACH OF THE OTHERS
YELLOW EAGLE AND HIS FOLLOWERS CAME UP WITH THEM JUST AT THE VERY SPOT WHERE THEY HAD SEEN THE PSAMMEAD THAT MORNING BREATHLESS AND BEATEN THE WRETCHED CHILDREN NOW AWAITED THEIR FATE
BUT THERE ARE OTHER TORMENTS THAN THE SCALPING KNIFE AND THE FLAMES YET IS THE SLOW FIRE THE CORRECT THING O STRANGE UNNATURAL COUNTRY WHEREIN A MAN MAY FIND NO WOOD TO BURN HIS ENEMY
TO VISIT LORNA IMMEDIATELY AFTER MY DISCOURSE WITH MOTHER AND TO TELL HER ALL ABOUT IT MY BEAUTY GAVE ME ONE SWEET KISS WITH ALL HER HEART AS SHE ALWAYS DID WHEN SHE KISSED AT ALL
THEN I PLACED THE PEARL RING BACK ON THE SOFT ELASTIC BEND OF THE FINGER SHE HELD UP TO SCOLD ME AND ON MY OWN SMALLEST FINGER DREW THE HEAVY HOOP SHE HAD GIVEN ME
AND THEIR MOTHER ALTHOUGH SHE HAD TAKEN SOME MONEY WHICH THE DOONES WERE ALWAYS FULL OF DECLARED THAT IT WAS A ROBBERY AND THOUGH IT INCREASED FOR A WHILE THE CUSTOM THAT MUST SOON FALL OFF AGAIN AND WHO WOULD HAVE HER TWO GIRLS NOW CLEVER AS THEY WERE AND GOOD
SETTLED FOR EVER WITHOUT OUR VOTES LET US OWN THAT HE WAS AT LEAST
FOR ALL OF US WERE RESOLVED THIS TIME TO HAVE NO MORE SHILLY SHALLYING BUT TO GO THROUGH WITH A NASTY BUSINESS IN THE STYLE OF HONEST ENGLISHMEN WHEN THE QUESTION COMES TO YOUR LIFE OR MINE
UPON THE WHOLE I REJOICED THAT LORNA WAS NOT PRESENT NOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN IRKSOME TO HER FEELINGS TO HAVE ALL HER KINDRED AND OLD ASSOCIATES MUCH AS SHE KEPT ALOOF FROM THEM
AND THIS NOT ONLY FROM FEAR LEST ONE MORE WICKED MIGHT SUCCEED HIM AS APPEARED INDEED TOO PROBABLE BUT FROM TRUE ADMIRATION OF HIS STRONG WILL AND SYMPATHY WITH HIS MISFORTUNES
AND LEAVING BEHIND HIM SHADOWY PROMISE OF THE MOUNTAINS HE WOULD DO FOR ME MY SPIRIT BEGAN TO BURN AND PANT FOR SOMETHING TO GO ON WITH AND NOTHING SHOWED A BRAVER HOPE OF MOVEMENT AND ADVENTURE THAN A LONELY VISIT TO GLEN DOONE BY WAY OF THE PERILOUS PASSAGE DISCOVERED IN MY BOYHOOD
DAYS OF OUR LANGUAGE FOR HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT OUR LORNA COULD HAVE COME ALL THAT WAY
WHILE ALL THE TIME THERE WAS NOTHING WHATEVER EXCEPT MY OWN LOVE OF ADVENTURE AND SPORT TO KEEP ME FROM COMING HOME AGAIN BUT I KNEW THAT MY COAT OF ARMS AND TITLE WOULD TURN EVERY BIT OF THIS GRUMBLING INTO FINE ADMIRATION
IN THE THICK OF THE FIRING IN FRONT OF THEM FOR THE ORDERS TO THOSE OF THE SHAM ATTACK CONDUCTED BY TOM FAGGUS
SUCH A MAN MUST BE VERY WRETCHED IN THIS PURE DEARTH OF MORALITY LIKE A FISHERMAN WHERE NO FISH BE AND MOST OF US HAVE ENOUGH TO DO TO ATTEND TO OUR OWN MORALS ENOUGH THAT I RESOLVED TO GO
WITH THEIR CHINS UPON ONE ANOTHER BUT WE BEING BLINDER THAN THEY I SUPPOSE AND NOT HAVING HAD A GREAT SNOW FOR YEARS MADE NO PREPARATION AGAINST THE STORM EXCEPT THAT THE LAMBING EWES WERE IN SHELTER
THAT IN SPITE OF ALL GOOD RESOLUTIONS AND HER OWN FAINT PROTEST I WAS FORCED TO ABANDON ALL FIRM IDEAS AND KISS HER TILL SHE WAS QUITE ASHAMED AND HER HEAD HUNG ON MY BOSOM WITH THE NIGHT
AND HERE LET ME MENTION ALTHOUGH THE TWO ARE QUITE DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT
YES I KNOW ENOUGH OF THAT AND I AM FRIGHTENED GREATLY ALL THE TIME WHEN I DO NOT LOOK AT YOU SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO ANSWER ME IN THE STYLE SOME MAIDENS WOULD HAVE USED THE MANNER I MEAN WHICH NOW WE CALL FROM A FOREIGN WORD COQUETTISH AND MORE THAN THAT
AND IT GREATLY KEPT MY SPIRITS DOWN ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT SO VERY MUCH FRIGHTEN ME FOR IT TAKES A MAN BUT A LITTLE WHILE HIS INSTINCT BEING OF DEATH PERHAPS
WOULD TURN THE MILD CHEEK TO EVERYTHING
BUT THE CHILD BEING BORN OF HER MISTRESS SHE WISHED HIM GOOD LUCK AND LEFT HIM AS THE FIERCE MEN CAME DOWNSTAIRS AND BEING ALARMED BY THEIR POWER OF LANGUAGE BECAUSE THEY HAD FOUND NO SILVER SHE CREPT AWAY IN A BREATHLESS HURRY AND AFRAID HOW HER BREATH MIGHT COME BACK TO HER
AT LEAST AS MUCH AS OF LIFE WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR HIS SLAYING HIS FELLOW MEN SO AND EVERY OTHER CREATURE IT DOES NOT TAKE A MAN VERY LONG TO ENTER INTO ANOTHER MAN'S DEATH AND BRING HIS OWN MOOD TO SUIT IT
IF THIS WERE ALL THE STYLE OF IT THEN HAVING KNOWN HIM A LUSTY MAN AND A FINE SINGER IN AN ALE HOUSE
HOW BADLY THEY WOULD TAKE THE WATER WHAT WITH URGING OF THE TAILOR AND MY OWN MISGIVINGS THE TIME WAS NOW COME ROUND AGAIN TO THE HIGH DAY OF SAINT VALENTINE WHEN ALL OUR MAIDS WERE FULL OF LOVERS AND ALL THE LADS LOOKED FOOLISH
HAVING LORNA UNDER IT IN THE MORNING LORNA WAS READY TO TELL HER STORY AND WE TO
LORNA CRIED WHEN I CAME AWAY WHICH GAVE ME GREAT SATISFACTION AND SHE SENT A WHOLE TRUNKFUL OF THINGS FOR MOTHER AND ANNIE AND EVEN LIZZIE AND SHE SEEMED TO THINK THOUGH SHE SAID IT NOT THAT I MADE MY OWN OCCASION FOR GOING
GREATLY AMAZED PRAY WHAT THINKS MY LORD OF IT THAT IS WORTH FIFTY OF THE PEARL THING WHICH I GAVE YOU YOU DARLING AND THAT I WILL NOT TAKE IT FROM YOU
HE WAS TOO GOOD FOR THIS WORLD AS WE SAY OF ALL PEOPLE WHO LEAVE IT AND I VERILY BELIEVE HIS HEART WAS NOT A BAD ONE AFTER ALL
GORSE ON THE MOORS DROVE ME WILD AND THE PRIMROSES UNDER THE HEDGES I AM SURE I WAS MEANT FOR A FARMER'S I MEAN FOR A FARM HOUSE LIFE DEAR LIZZIE' FOR LIZZIE WAS LOOKING SAUCILY
WAS SATISFIED NOW WITH MY ANKLES AFTER SOME LABOUR I REACHED THE TOP AND HALTED TO LOOK ABOUT ME WELL BEFORE TRUSTING TO BROAD DAYLIGHT THE WINTER AS I SAID BEFORE HAD BEEN A VERY MILD ONE
SABLE UPON SILVER ALL THIS WAS VERY FIERCE AND FINE AND SO I PRESSED FOR A PEACEFUL CORNER IN THE LOWER DEXTER AND OBTAINED A WHEAT SHEAF SET UPRIGHT GOLD UPON A FIELD OF GREEN HERE I WAS INCLINED TO PAUSE AND ADMIRE THE EFFECT
AND TO TREAT WITH HER HAVING HEARD FOR THE MAN WAS AS BIG A GOSSIP AS NEVER CARED FOR ANYBODY YET LOVED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT EVERYBODY THAT THIS WEALTHY AND BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN
I THOUGHT THAT WE MIGHT TAKE THEM PRISONERS
AND HER KNOWLEDGE OF MY HEART WAS NOT TO BE CHECKED BY ANY THOUGHTS OF HAPLY COMING EVIL IN THE MORNING SHE WAS UP EVEN SOONER THAN I WAS AND THROUGH ALL THE CORNERS OF THE HENS REMEMBERING EVERY ONE OF THEM I CAUGHT HER
I CONSIDERED THIS WITH SATISFACTION UNTIL MY DARLING RECOVERED HERSELF
IF ANY MAN THROWS HIS WEIGHT BACK DOWN HE GOES AND PERHAPS HE MAY NEVER GET UP AGAIN AND MOST LIKELY HE WILL SHOOT HIMSELF I WAS STILL MORE AFRAID OF THEIR SHOOTING ME FOR MY CHIEF ALARM IN
THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN A NORWEGIAN BIRD CALLED IN THIS COUNTRY A ROLLER WHO NEVER COMES TO ENGLAND BUT IN THE MOST TREMENDOUS WINTERS ANOTHER LITTLE BIRD THERE WAS WHOM I LONGED TO WELCOME HOME AND PROTECT FROM ENEMIES
ALL THE CRIME AND OUTRAGE WROUGHT BY MY RECKLESS FAMILY IT EVER CAN BE MEANT FOR ME TO SETTLE DOWN TO PEACE AND COMFORT IN A SIMPLE HOUSEHOLD WITH ALL MY HEART I LONG FOR HOME ANY HOME
PARTRIDGES THAT CAME TO HAND WITH A DRY NOISE IN THEIR CROPS HEATH POULTS MAKING CUPS OF SNOW AND A FEW POOR HOPPING REDWINGS FLIPPING IN AND OUT THE HEDGE HAVING LOST THE POWER TO FLY
WHILE I WAS FORGETTING MUCH OF MANY THINGS THAT HARM ONE AND LETTING OF MY THOUGHTS GO WILD TO SOUNDS AND SIGHTS OF NATURE A SWEETER NOTE THAN THRUSH OR OUZEL EVER WOOED A MATE IN FLOATED ON THE VALLEY BREEZE AT THE QUIET TURN OF SUNDOWN
BUT MEANWHILE I MIGHT IMPROVE MYSELF AND LEARN A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT THE WIND HATH A DRAW AFTER FLYING STRAW IS A SAYING WE HAVE IN DEVONSHIRE MADE PERADVENTURE BY SOMEBODY WHO HAD SEEN THE WAYS OF WOMEN MISTRESS LORNA I WILL DEPART'
WHICH HIS MOTHER SAID NOTHING COULD EQUAL NEVERTHELESS HE WOULD COME TO BE NURSED AS REGULAR AS A CLOCK ALMOST AND INASMUCH AS HE WAS THE FIRST BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER MADE MUCH OF HIM FOR GOD ONLY KNEW WHETHER THEY COULD EVER COMPASS SUCH ANOTHER ONE
AND LONG FOR NOTHING BETTER I FEEL WITH EVERY BLADE OF GRASS AS IF IT HAD A HISTORY AND MAKE A CHILD OF EVERY BUD AS THOUGH IT KNEW AND LOVED ME AND BEING SO THEY SEEM TO TELL ME OF MY OWN DELUSIONS HOW I AM NO MORE THAN THEY EXCEPT IN SELF IMPORTANCE
OH YES I REMEMBER EVERYTHING BECAUSE IT WAS SO RARE TO SEE ANY EXCEPT I MEAN BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO REMEMBER
AND WHO COULD TELL IN THREE YEARS TIME WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ALL OR ANY OF US WHY PERHAPS HIS FARM WOULD BE FOR SALE AND PERHAPS LADY LORNA'S ESTATES IN SCOTLAND WOULD FETCH ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY IT
WORDS THE LIVING WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT SPRINKLING WITH HIS LITTLE BROOM DROPS THAT COULD NOT PURIFY WHILE THE CHILDREN ROBED IN WHITE SWUNG THEIR SMOKING CENSERS SLOWLY OVER THE COLD AND TWILIGHT GRAVE
AND THERE GOT HOLD OF A FINE ASH STAKE CUT BY MYSELF NOT LONG AGO WITH THIS I PLOUGHED ALONG PRETTY WELL AND THUNDERED SO HARD AT JOHN FRY'S DOOR THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE DOONES AT LEAST AND COCKED HIS BLUNDERBUSS OUT OF THE WINDOW
WITH MY HEART RENDING GROWL MY HORRIBLE SHUDDERFUL GROWL I SHOULD SAY NOT I AM NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING DECLARED THE WOOZY I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME SIGHED OJO
RETURNED THE WOOZY SO
THE SHAGGY MAN MADE NO REPLY TO THIS SPEECH
DO NOT BLAME ME MISS GORGEOUS IF I REGARD YOU WITH SUSPICION MANY A SATIN RIBBON HAS A COTTON BACK SCRAPS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS BUT SHE HAD AN UNEASY MISGIVING THAT SHE HAD A COTTON BACK HERSELF
OZMA SAT LOOKING AT THE PRISONER A LONG TIME THEN SHE SAID GENTLY ONE OF THE LAWS OF OZ FORBIDS ANYONE TO PICK A SIX LEAVED CLOVER YOU ARE ACCUSED OF HAVING BROKEN THIS LAW EVEN AFTER YOU HAD BEEN WARNED NOT TO DO SO
THEY HAD TRAVELED SOME DISTANCE WHEN SUDDENLY THEY FACED A HIGH FENCE WHICH BARRED ANY FURTHER PROGRESS STRAIGHT AHEAD IT RAN DIRECTLY ACROSS THE ROAD AND ENCLOSED A SMALL FOREST OF TALL TREES SET CLOSE TOGETHER
BUT THAT DID NOT ALTER THE FACT THAT HE HAD COMMITTED A FAULT
BUT I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO GO IF WE WANT THAT GILL OF WATER FROM THE DARK WELL SO THEY SAID GOOD BYE TO THE PUMPKINHEAD AND RESUMED THEIR TRAVELS
THEN HE TOLD HOW HE HAD SET OUT TO FIND THE FIVE DIFFERENT THINGS WHICH THE MAGICIAN NEEDED TO MAKE A CHARM THAT WOULD RESTORE THE MARBLE FIGURES TO LIFE ONE REQUIREMENT BEING THREE HAIRS FROM A WOOZY'S TAIL WE FOUND THE WOOZY EXPLAINED THE BOY
AND FOUND THAT A STRANGE MAN WAS STANDING BEFORE HIM A MAN SO CURIOUS IN APPEARANCE THAT THE BOY STARED WITH ROUND EYES HE WAS A BIG MAN WITH SHAGGY WHISKERS SHAGGY EYEBROWS SHAGGY HAIR
IS THAT THE WAY WE GO ASKED BUNGLE ANXIOUSLY NO SAID OJO
HAVEN'T YOU ALWAYS LIVED IN THE LAND OF OZ ASKED THE MUNCHKIN BOY
AND I'VE FACED THE FIGHTING TREES WHICH BEND DOWN THEIR BRANCHES TO POUND AND WHIP YOU AND HAD MANY OTHER ADVENTURES THERE IT'S A WILD COUNTRY REMARKED DOROTHY SOBERLY AND IF WE GO THERE WE'RE SURE TO HAVE TROUBLES OF OUR OWN
THE FIRST LEAF HE CUT DOWN RELEASED SCRAPS AND ON SEEING HER THE SHAGGY MAN THREW BACK HIS SHAGGY HEAD OPENED WIDE HIS MOUTH AND LAUGHED SO SHAGGILY AND YET SO MERRILY THAT SCRAPS LIKED HIM AT ONCE
THE NECK WAS A SHARPENED STICK ON WHICH THE PUMPKIN HEAD WAS SET AND THE EYES EARS NOSE AND MOUTH WERE CARVED ON THE SKIN OF THE PUMPKIN VERY LIKE A CHILD'S JACK O' LANTERN
ASKED SCRAPS THAT I CANNOT TELL SINCE I CAME TO THE LAND OF OZ NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN ARRESTED OR IMPRISONED UNTIL OJO BROKE THE LAW
AND WHILE YOU ARE GONE I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL I'LL TAKE CARE OF MYSELF ANNOUNCED SCRAPS FOR I'M GOING WITH THE SCARECROW AND DOROTHY I PROMISED OJO TO HELP HIM FIND THE THINGS HE WANTS AND I'LL STICK TO MY PROMISE VERY WELL REPLIED OZMA
PROTESTED THE SHAGGY MAN MAY BE ANSWERED THE WOOZY
YOU MUST BE AWFULLY HUNGRY SAID THE BOY I'VE GOT SOME BREAD AND CHEESE IN MY BASKET WOULD YOU LIKE THAT KIND OF FOOD GIVE ME A NIBBLE AND I WILL TRY IT THEN I CAN TELL YOU BETTER WHETHER IT IS GRATEFUL TO MY APPETITE
AND ONE OR TWO WHO HAD BEEN SLAPPED HARDEST BEGAN TO CRY THEN SUDDENLY THEY GAVE A SHOUT ALL TOGETHER AND DISAPPEARED IN A FLASH INTO THEIR VARIOUS HOUSES THE TOPS OF WHICH CLOSED WITH A SERIES OF POPS THAT SOUNDED LIKE A BUNCH OF FIRECRACKERS BEING EXPLODED
AT OZMA'S FEET CROUCHED TWO ENORMOUS BEASTS EACH THE LARGEST AND MOST POWERFUL OF ITS KIND ALTHOUGH THESE BEASTS WERE QUITE FREE NO ONE PRESENT WAS ALARMED BY THEM FOR THE COWARDLY LION AND THE HUNGRY TIGER WERE WELL KNOWN AND RESPECTED IN THE EMERALD CITY
OJO THOUGHT THIS OVER VERY CAREFULLY I HAD AN IDEA SAID HE THAT PRISONERS WERE ALWAYS TREATED HARSHLY TO PUNISH THEM
CHAPTER NINE THEY MEET THE WOOZY THERE SEEM TO BE VERY FEW HOUSES AROUND HERE AFTER ALL REMARKED OJO AFTER THEY HAD WALKED FOR A TIME IN SILENCE NEVER MIND SAID SCRAPS WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR HOUSES
THE OPENING WAS PERFECTLY SQUARE AND ABOUT BIG ENOUGH TO ADMIT A GOAT I GUESS THE WOOZY IS ASLEEP SAID SCRAPS SHALL I THROW IN A STONE TO WAKEN HIM NO PLEASE DON'T ANSWERED OJO
THE QUADLING COUNTRY IS FULL OF DANGERS DECLARED JACK I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE MYSELF BUT I HAVE SAID THE SCARECROW I'VE FACED THE DREADFUL HAMMERHEADS WHICH HAVE NO ARMS AND BUTT YOU LIKE A GOAT
OJO WAS GREATLY ANNOYED BY THIS UNWELCOME ADDITION TO THEIR PARTY AT FIRST HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THE NEWCOMER BUT A LITTLE THOUGHT DECIDED HIM NOT TO MAKE FRIENDS
DO YOU MEAN THE PINK PEBBLES YOU CALL YOUR BRAINS AND YOUR RED HEART AND GREEN EYES ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL NO I MEAN YOU IF YOU MUST KNOW IT GROWLED THE CAT
ONE SAID OJO IS A SIX LEAVED CLOVER
I'D TAKE ANY ORDINARY WELL AND ENCLOSE IT SO AS TO MAKE IT DARK I FEAR THAT WOULDN'T DO REPLIED THE SCARECROW
THAT IS PERHAPS THE BEST THING TO DO REPLIED THE WIZARD BUT AFTER THE CROOKED MAGICIAN HAS RESTORED THOSE POOR PEOPLE TO LIFE YOU MUST TAKE AWAY HIS MAGIC POWERS I WILL PROMISED OZMA NOW TELL ME PLEASE WHAT MAGIC THINGS MUST YOU FIND
SAID HE FOR THE FLAMES WOULD ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE MUNCHKIN FARMERS WHO WOULD THEN COME AND CAPTURE THE WOOZY AGAIN I GUESS THEY'LL BE RATHER SURPRISED WHEN THEY FIND HE'S ESCAPED SO THEY WILL DECLARED THE WOOZY
THEN TURNING THESE OVER SHE CAME UPON THE SIX LEAVED CLOVER WHICH THE BOY HAD PLUCKED SCRAPS WAS QUICK WITTED AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD NO HEART SHE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT OJO WAS HER FIRST FRIEND SHE KNEW AT ONCE THAT BECAUSE THE BOY HAD TAKEN THE CLOVER HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED
A WHAT INQUIRED SCRAPS IT IS CLASSICAL MUSIC AND IS CONSIDERED THE BEST AND MOST PUZZLING EVER MANUFACTURED YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIKE IT WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT
SAID THE SHAGGY MAN THERE IS A LAW AGAINST PICKING SIX LEAVED CLOVERS BUT I THINK I CAN GET OZMA TO LET YOU HAVE ONE THANK YOU REPLIED OJO THE NEXT THING IS THE LEFT WING OF A YELLOW BUTTERFLY
THE VELVET BREECHES HAD JEWELED BUCKLES AT THE KNEES AND SHAGS ALL AROUND THE BOTTOMS ON HIS BREAST HUNG A MEDALLION BEARING A PICTURE OF PRINCESS DOROTHY OF OZ AND IN HIS HAND AS HE STOOD LOOKING AT OJO WAS A SHARP KNIFE SHAPED LIKE A DAGGER
AFTER WALKING SOME DISTANCE OVER THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS OJO SAID HE WAS HUNGRY AND WOULD STOP TO EAT SOME BREAD AND CHEESE HE OFFERED A PORTION OF THE FOOD TO THE SHAGGY MAN WHO THANKED HIM BUT REFUSED IT
SAID THE SHAGGY MAN YAWNING THE GLASS CAT SEEMED ANNOYED DO YOU THINK A PINK KITTEN COMMON MEAT IS AS PRETTY AS I AM SHE ASKED CAN'T SAY TASTES DIFFER YOU KNOW REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN YAWNING AGAIN
BUT NEITHER STRUGGLES NOR PROTESTS HAD ANY EFFECT WHATEVER THE LEAF HELD HIM FIRMLY AND HE WAS A PRISONER THEN OJO QUIETED HIMSELF AND TRIED TO THINK
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE ALL FAST COLORS OJO SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY THEY SEEM FAST ENOUGH WHEN YOU RUN HE REPLIED AND THEN
ANSWERED THE SCARECROW WHO DID NOT WISH TO DISPLAY HIS IGNORANCE I KNOW CRIED SCRAPS JACK AND JILL WENT UP THE HILL TO FETCH NO NO THAT'S WRONG INTERRUPTED THE SCARECROW THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF GILLS I THINK
BUT HE KNEW ONE COULD SUFFER A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN HIS GREATEST FEAR AT THIS TIME WAS THAT HE WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN IMPRISONED IN THE BEAUTIFUL LEAF AND NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAIN NO SOUND CAME TO HIM THROUGH THE LEAF
BUT THE PLAY WAS A LITTLE ROUGH AND I'D HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF IT WHEN YOU INTERFERED SIX OF THEM SAT ON ME SAID OJO BUT AS THEY ARE SO LITTLE THEY DIDN'T HURT ME MUCH JUST THEN THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE IN FRONT OF THEM OPENED
WAS THE REPLY BUT I SING LIKE A BIRD
AND THE NOVELTY OF THE SCENE DREW OUR TRAVELERS CLOSE TO THE LINE OF PLANTS WHERE THEY STOOD WATCHING THEM WITH RAPT INTEREST SUDDENLY A LEAF BENT LOWER THAN USUAL AND TOUCHED THE PATCHWORK GIRL SWIFTLY
FOR THAT YOU MUST GO TO THE WINKIE COUNTRY THE SHAGGY MAN DECLARED I'VE NEVER NOTICED ANY BUTTERFLIES THERE BUT THAT IS THE YELLOW COUNTRY OF OZ AND IT'S RULED BY A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE
AS THE BOY AROSE AND ASSISTED THE PATCHWORK GIRL TO HER FEET A DOZEN STRONG MEN COULDN'T PULL OUT THOSE HAIRS I BELIEVE THEY'RE CLINCHED ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE WOOZY'S THICK SKIN THEN WHAT SHALL I DO
CHAPTER SEVEN THE TROUBLESOME PHONOGRAPH WHEN THE BOY OPENED HIS EYES NEXT MORNING HE LOOKED CAREFULLY AROUND THE ROOM THESE SMALL MUNCHKIN HOUSES SELDOM HAD MORE THAN ONE ROOM IN THEM
TUMULTUOUS EXCITEMENT OF MY FEELINGS BUT MY GOOD AUNT WAS TOUCHED AT MY AGITATION IN A SOFTER TONE SHE REPEATED HER RECOMMENDATION TO RETIRE AND GENTLY KISSING MY FOREHEAD
THIS IS BY OPENLY BUT NOT TOO GLARINGLY COQUETTING WITH MISTER HUNTINGDON WHO IS QUITE WILLING TO BE HER PARTNER IN THE GAME BUT I DON'T CARE FOR IT BECAUSE WITH HIM I KNOW THERE IS NOTHING BUT PERSONAL VANITY
ACQUAINTANCES AT LEAST IN THE WORLD FROM WHOM I DESIRE MY PRESENT ABODE TO BE CONCEALED AND AS THEY MIGHT SEE THE PICTURE AND MIGHT POSSIBLY RECOGNISE THE STYLE IN SPITE OF THE FALSE INITIALS I HAVE PUT IN THE CORNER
WHY AS TO THAT I CAN'T SAY YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL FALLIBLE CREATURES HELEN WE NONE OF US DESERVE TO BE WORSHIPPED BUT ARE YOU SURE YOUR DARLING HUNTINGDON
AND SAW MISTER HARGRAVE STANDING BESIDE ME ON THE RUG
TO THOSE WHO HAVE THREE TIMES HER WEALTH AND ABOVE ALL BECAUSE SHE IS DETERMINED HER CHERISHED SON SHALL BE ENABLED TO
BUT STILL IT LINGERS IN MY HEART AND WHO CAN TELL BUT HEAVEN AT LAST MAY ANSWER ALL MY THOUSAND PRAYERS AND BID THE FUTURE PAY THE PAST WITH JOY FOR ANGUISH
IF I MAY NE'ER BEHOLD AGAIN THAT FORM AND FACE SO DEAR TO ME NOR HEAR THY VOICE STILL WOULD I FAIN PRESERVE FOR AYE THEIR MEMORY THAT VOICE
I CAN AMUSE AND PLEASE HIM WITH MY SIMPLE SONGS BUT NOT DELIGHT HIM THUS
SHE LOOKED BACK AT LORD LOWBOROUGH WHO WAS STANDING A LITTLE BEHIND LEANING AGAINST THE BACK OF A CHAIR AN ATTENTIVE LISTENER TOO EXPERIENCING TO JUDGE BY HIS COUNTENANCE
BUT I DID NOT LEAVE THE ROOM HAPPILY IT WAS GETTING LATE AND COULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE THE COMPANY DISPERSED I WENT TO THE FIRE AND
APPARENTLY IMMERSED IN THE PERUSAL OF A VOLUME OF THE FARMER'S MAGAZINE
BUT AS I WENT THE TRAMP OF HORSES HOOFS FELL ON MY EAR AND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE DEWY EVENING AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE LANE I SAW A SOLITARY EQUESTRIAN COMING UP INCLINING TO DUSK AS IT WAS
WOULD YOU BELIEVE MY PROTESTATIONS AND HONOUR AND TRUST ME UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE CASES ARE DIFFERENT HE REPLIED IT IS A WOMAN'S NATURE TO BE CONSTANT TO LOVE ONE AND ONE ONLY
I MUST SEE HER TOO AND SPEAK TO HER THAT WAS CERTAIN BUT WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO ACT I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA
AND KNEELING BEFORE ME WITH CLASPED HANDS UPLIFTED IN MOCK HUMILIATION HE CONTINUED IMPLORINGLY
BUT IMMEDIATELY I WAS SENSIBLE OF HAVING COMMITTED AN ACT OF IMPERTINENCE IN SO DOING FOR SHE COLOURED AND HESITATED BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE FRANKNESS SHE REPLIED BECAUSE I HAVE FRIENDS
WHAT IS IT THAT CONSTITUTES VIRTUE MISSUS GRAHAM
AND SOMEONE ENTERED THE ROOM I TRUSTED IT WAS ONLY A SERVANT AND DID NOT STIR THE DOOR WAS CLOSED AGAIN BUT I WAS NOT ALONE A HAND GENTLY TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND A VOICE SAID SOFTLY
REALLY EJACULATED MY MOTHER WHY SO MISTER MILLWARD ASKED I HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SOME SEVERITY AND TURNING AGAIN TO MY MOTHER REPEATED
NOR THE MILLWARDS HAD BEEN RETURNED AS YET NOW HOWEVER THE CAUSE OF THAT OMISSION WAS EXPLAINED
AND SEEMED INCLINED TO TURN BACK BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT APPARENTLY JUDGED IT BETTER TO CONTINUE HIS COURSE AS BEFORE HE ACCOSTED ME WITH A SLIGHT BOW AND EDGING CLOSE TO THE WALL ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ON BUT I WAS NOT SO MINDED
THE BRIGHT BLUE EYES REGARDED THE SPECTATOR WITH A KIND OF LURKING DROLLERY YOU ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE THEM WINK THE LIPS A LITTLE TOO VOLUPTUOUSLY FULL SEEMED READY TO BREAK INTO A SMILE
INTIMATE THAT THE OWNER THEREOF WAS PROUDER OF HIS BEAUTY THAN HIS INTELLECT AS PERHAPS HE HAD REASON TO BE AND YET HE LOOKED NO FOOL I HAD NOT HAD THE PORTRAIT IN MY HANDS TWO MINUTES BEFORE THE FAIR ARTIST RETURNED
AS HE DEPOSITED HIS PONDEROUS BULK IN THE ARM CHAIR THAT ROSE OFFICIOUSLY BROUGHT TOWARDS HIM IT IS JUST SIX WEEKS BY MY RECKONING SINCE YOU DARKENED MY DOOR HE SPOKE IT WITH EMPHASIS AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR
WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE BEEN HUNGERING AND THIRSTING ALL DAY FOR THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE COME THE PIANO'S VACANT IT WAS FOR I HAD QUITTED IT IMMEDIATELY UPON HEARING HIS PETITION
THEY WON'T REFUSE ME IF YOU DON'T I'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT MY AUNT DISLIKES YOU BUT YOU DON'T HELEN SAY YOU LOVE ME AND I'LL GO I WISH YOU WOULD GO I REPLIED
WHISPERED ROSE THE CHILD LOOKED AT HER IN GRAVE SURPRISE SHE STRAIGHTWAY BEGAN TO TALK TO HIM ON INDIFFERENT MATTERS WHILE I AMUSED MYSELF WITH LOOKING AT THE PICTURES THERE WAS ONE IN AN OBSCURE CORNER THAT I HAD NOT BEFORE OBSERVED
NEVER MIND ARTHUR SAID HIS MAMMA MISSUS MARKHAM THINKS IT WILL DO YOU GOOD AS YOU WERE TIRED WITH YOUR WALK BUT SHE WILL NOT OBLIGE YOU TO TAKE IT
YOU'RE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL AREN'T YOU WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO SO OFTEN NONSENSE CHILD I DON'T GO ONCE IN SIX WEEKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THAT HAVE REQUIRED ON MANY OCCASIONS MORE WATCHFULNESS AND FIRMNESS TO RESIST THAN I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN ABLE TO MUSTER AGAINST THEM AND THIS I BELIEVE IS WHAT MOST OTHERS WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO REFLECTION
BUT THEY DON'T SPEAK OPENLY TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS IT IS ONLY BY HINTS AND INNUENDOES AND BY WHAT I HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THEY THINK WELL THEN I WON'T GO TO DAY AS IT'S GETTING LATISH
AND IN TRUTH THE VICAR WAS JUST BEHIND ME PLODDING HOMEWARD FROM SOME REMOTE CORNER OF HIS PARISH I IMMEDIATELY RELEASED THE SQUIRE AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY SALUTING MISTER MILLWARD AS HE PASSED
I DO KNOW SOMETHING OF HIM BUT YOU MUST EXCUSE ME THIS TIME
BUT SENT OUT TO BATTLE AGAINST IT ALONE AND UNASSISTED NOT TAUGHT TO AVOID THE SNARES OF LIFE BUT BOLDLY TO RUSH INTO THEM OR OVER THEM AS HE MAY TO SEEK DANGER RATHER THAN SHUN IT AND FEED HIS VIRTUE BY TEMPTATION WOULD YOU
AND THEN AGAIN ON A DARK CLOUDY EVENING FOR I REALLY HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO PAINT
WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT MY REAL DISPOSITION AND PRINCIPLES SHE WAS EVIDENTLY PREJUDICED AGAINST ME AND SEEMED BENT UPON SHOWING ME THAT HER OPINIONS RESPECTING ME ON EVERY PARTICULAR FELL FAR BELOW THOSE I ENTERTAINED OF MYSELF
IS IT THAT YOU THINK SHE HAS NO VIRTUE ASSUREDLY NOT WELL BUT YOU AFFIRM THAT VIRTUE IS ONLY ELICITED BY TEMPTATION AND YOU THINK THAT A WOMAN CANNOT BE TOO LITTLE EXPOSED TO TEMPTATION OR TOO LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH VICE
AND A DULL BECLOUDED SKY ABOVE YOU SEE THERE IS A SAD DEARTH OF SUBJECTS OBSERVED THE FAIR ARTIST I TOOK THE OLD HALL ONCE ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND I SUPPOSE I MUST TAKE IT AGAIN ON A SNOWY WINTER'S DAY
WHAT IS THE MATTER I COULD NOT ANSWER AT THE MOMENT YOU MUST AND SHALL TELL ME WAS ADDED MORE VEHEMENTLY AND THE SPEAKER THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BESIDE ME ON THE RUG
AND TO GO TO A CERTAIN LENGTH IN YOUTHFUL INDULGENCES NOT SO MUCH TO GRATIFY HIS OWN TASTES AS TO MAINTAIN HIS REPUTATION AS A MAN OF FASHION IN THE WORLD
YOU AND YOUR PONY BE WHAT MAKES YOU SO COARSE AND BRUTAL MARKHAM I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS SPOT I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS PERFIDIOUS DUPLICITY
AND THE GREATEST INDIFFERENCE TO THE ARTS OF MY ATTRACTIVE GUEST I HAVE NEVER REPROACHED THE FORMER BUT ONCE AND THAT WAS FOR LAUGHING AT LORD LOWBOROUGH'S DEPRESSED AND ANXIOUS COUNTENANCE ONE EVENING WHEN THEY HAD BOTH BEEN PARTICULARLY PROVOKING
I HAVE A GOOD MIND TO ASK ARTHUR'S LEAVE TO INVITE THE OLD LADY TO STAY WITH US TILL OUR GUESTS DEPART I THINK I WILL SHE WILL TAKE IT AS A KIND ATTENTION AND
AND ANSWERED CALMLY YOU THINK NOT NO REPLIED HE BOLDLY AFTER ALL WHAT HAVE I DONE IT'S NOTHING
YOU ARE STILL RATHER A NOVICE IN YOUR NEW BERTH AND
MISTER VLADIMIR'S TONE BECAME LOFTY FOR MY PART I CAN'T SHARE YOUR VIEW IT IS SELFISH MY SENTIMENTS FOR MY OWN COUNTRY CANNOT BE DOUBTED BUT I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT WE OUGHT TO BE GOOD EUROPEANS BESIDES
WITH BIG ELBOWS STUCK OUT SAID HASTILY BE LUCID PLEASE YES SIR ETHELRED AN IMPERFECT WORLD THEREFORE DIRECTLY THE CHARACTER OF THIS AFFAIR SUGGESTED ITSELF TO ME I THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH WITH SPECIAL SECRECY
AS I MAY THINK PROPER CERTAINLY SAID THE PERSONAGE ON THE HEARTHRUG FIND OUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN FIND IT OUT IN YOUR OWN WAY
THEY UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER WHICH IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO BOTH AND ESTABLISHES A SORT OF AMENITY IN THEIR RELATIONS PRODUCTS OF THE SAME MACHINE ONE CLASSED AS USEFUL AND THE OTHER AS NOXIOUS THEY TAKE THE MACHINE FOR GRANTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS
FACING THE ONLY GAS LAMP YAWNED THE CAVERN OF A SECOND HAND FURNITURE DEALER WHERE DEEP IN THE GLOOM OF A SORT OF NARROW AVENUE WINDING THROUGH A BIZARRE FOREST OF WARDROBES WITH AN UNDERGROWTH TANGLE OF TABLE LEGS
YOU'VE A BAD COLD IT WAS INDEED OBVIOUS THAT MISTER VERLOC WAS NOT IN HIS USUAL STATE PHYSICALLY AND EVEN MENTALLY A SOMBRE IRRESOLUTION HELD HIM SILENT FOR A WHILE
WITHOUT AS MUCH AS A QUIVER STIRRING THE WHITE THONGS OF THEIR BIG WHIPS MISTER VLADIMIR WALKED ON AND THE CONFOUNDED POLICEMAN FELL INTO STEP AT HIS ELBOW HE SAID NOTHING
CHAPTER TEN THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER DRIVEN RAPIDLY IN A HANSOM FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SOHO IN THE DIRECTION OF WESTMINSTER GOT OUT AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE EMPIRE ON WHICH THE SUN NEVER SETS
POLITICAL AND REVOLUTIONARY ACTION RELYING PARTLY ON VIOLENCE THE PROFESSIONAL SPY HAS EVERY FACILITY TO FABRICATE THE VERY FACTS THEMSELVES AND WILL SPREAD THE DOUBLE EVIL OF EMULATION IN ONE DIRECTION AND OF PANIC
MORE OR LESS DEPLORABLE DOES HAPPEN BUT THE HIGH OFFICIAL CARRIED AWAY BY HIS SENSE OF THE FITNESS OF THINGS
HE BEHELD IN THAT ONE MAN ALL THE FORCES HE HAD SET AT DEFIANCE THE FORCE OF LAW PROPERTY OPPRESSION AND INJUSTICE HE BEHELD ALL HIS ENEMIES AND FEARLESSLY CONFRONTED THEM ALL IN A SUPREME SATISFACTION OF HIS VANITY
YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH DON'T YOU OH YES I UNDERSTAND ENGLISH THERE WAS NOTHING FOREIGN IN HIS ACCENT EXCEPT THAT HE SEEMED IN HIS SLOW ENUNCIATION TO BE TAKING PAINS WITH IT
A DARK MAN WITH THE RIDGE OF THE CHEEK BONE WELL DEFINED UNDER THE SLIGHTLY HOLLOW TEMPLE A COMPLETE STRANGER NOT A CUSTOMER EITHER MISSUS VERLOC LOOKED AT HIM PLACIDLY YOU CAME OVER FROM THE CONTINENT
YOU COULD DO ANYTHING WITH THAT BOY ADOLF MISSUS VERLOC SAID WITH HER BEST AIR OF INFLEXIBLE CALMNESS HE WOULD GO THROUGH FIRE FOR YOU HE SHE PAUSED ATTENTIVE HER EAR TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR OF THE KITCHEN
FIRST AS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS TAINTED WITH MEDIOCRITY AND NEXT AS BEING IN A WAY AN ADMISSION OF INFERIORITY AND BOTH WERE FRANKLY INCONCEIVABLE TO HER NATURE
EVERYTHING THAT ROSE ABOVE THE DEAD LEVEL OF MANKIND LAWFULLY OR UNLAWFULLY BY POSITION WIT AUDACITY FORTUNE OR MISFORTUNE ROYAL HIGHNESSES ARTISTS MEN OF SCIENCE YOUNG STATESMEN
LET HIM RUN ON THE HOSPITAL PORTER AND ANOTHER MAN TURNED DOWN THE CORNERS OF THE CLOTH AND STEPPED ASIDE THE CHIEF INSPECTOR'S EYES SEARCHED THE GRUESOME DETAIL OF THAT HEAP OF MIXED THINGS
SHE WENT ROUND THE CORNER TO DRINK ARDENT SPIRITS IN A MEAN AND MUSTY PUBLIC HOUSE THE UNAVOIDABLE STATION ON THE VIA DOLOROSA OF HER LIFE MISSUS VERLOC'S COMMENT UPON THIS PRACTICE
WE'VE GOT THE MAN WE HAVE NO CHOICE
SHE WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY IN A TONE ALMOST TART IF YOU GO ABROAD YOU'LL HAVE TO GO WITHOUT ME YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T SAID MISTER VERLOC HUSKILY AND THE UNRESONANT VOICE OF HIS PRIVATE LIFE TREMBLED WITH AN ENIGMATICAL EMOTION
SHE SAID AFTER A TIME THE LONG THIN STRANGER WITHOUT EXACTLY LOOKING AT MISSUS VERLOC ANSWERED ONLY BY A FAINT AND PECULIAR SMILE MISSUS VERLOC'S STEADY INCURIOUS GAZE RESTED ON HIM
BEYOND THE GLOWING HEAPS OF ORANGES AND LEMONS NO FOOTSTEPS ECHOED THEY WOULD NEVER BE HEARD OF AGAIN THE ADVENTUROUS HEAD OF THE SPECIAL CRIMES DEPARTMENT WATCHED THESE DISAPPEARANCES FROM A DISTANCE WITH AN INTERESTED EYE HE FELT LIGHT HEARTED
BUSY FISHING FOR HIS HAT BUT WHEN HE GOT IT FROM UNDER THE SOFA HE HELD IT AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW THE USE OF A HAT WELL HE'S WAITING FOR YOU SAID MISSUS VERLOC AT LAST I SAY ADOLF
HE WALKED SLOWLY HOME MEDITATING THAT ENTERPRISE ON THE WAY AND THINKING OVER MISTER VERLOC'S PSYCHOLOGY IN A COMPOSITE MOOD OF REPUGNANCE AND SATISFACTION HE WALKED ALL THE WAY HOME
MADE IT APPEAR UNCERTAIN WHETHER HE MEANT TO STRANGLE OR TO EMBRACE HIS WIFE BUT MISSUS VERLOC'S ATTENTION WAS CALLED AWAY FROM THAT MANIFESTATION BY THE CLATTER OF THE SHOP BELL SHOP ADOLF YOU GO HE STOPPED
TO ARTISTS POLITICIANS THINKERS REFORMERS OR SAINTS A DESPICABLE EMOTIONAL STATE THIS AGAINST WHICH SOLITUDE FORTIFIES A SUPERIOR CHARACTER AND WITH
FOR THE THIRD TIME THAT DAY MISTER VERLOC WAS SURPRISED HE STARED STUPIDLY AT HIS WIFE SHE CONTINUED IN HER STEADY MANNER THE BOY WHENEVER HE WAS NOT DOING ANYTHING MOPED IN THE HOUSE
TO BE FEARLESSLY OUTSPOKEN IN HER OPINIONS CAME EASILY TO HER SINCE SHE JUDGED SOLELY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HER SOCIAL POSITION SHE WAS EQUALLY UNTRAMMELLED IN HER ACTIONS
HE'S GIVEN A WHOLE HALF HOUR TO THE CONSIDERATION OF MY VERY SMALL SPRAT INTERJECTED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SMALL IS IT I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT
THIS BARRIER OF BLAZING LIGHTS OPPOSING THE SHADOWS GATHERED ABOUT THE HUMBLE ABODE OF MISTER VERLOC'S DOMESTIC HAPPINESS SEEMED TO DRIVE THE OBSCURITY OF THE STREET BACK UPON ITSELF MAKE IT MORE SULLEN BROODING
IN MY OPINION THEY ARE A GHASTLY NUISANCE ALSO AN ELEMENT OF DANGER BUT WE CAN'T VERY WELL SEEK THEM OUT INDIVIDUALLY THE ONLY WAY IS TO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYMENT UNPLEASANT TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
SILENT BEHIND HER MOTHER'S BACK WENT ON ARRANGING THE COLLAR OF THE OLD WOMAN'S CLOAK SHE GOT HER HAND BAG AN UMBRELLA WITH AN IMPASSIVE FACE THE TIME HAD COME FOR THE EXPENDITURE OF THE SUM OF THREE AND SIXPENCE
IN THE SPIRIT NO DOUBT IN WHICH A MAN INVITES THE ATTENDANCE OF THE HOUSEHOLD DOG THOUGH OF COURSE IN A DIFFERENT MANNER IN THE HOUSE MISTER VERLOC COULD BE DETECTED STARING CURIOUSLY AT STEVIE A GOOD DEAL HIS OWN DEMEANOUR HAD CHANGED
HIS POSITION HAD TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE THE CLAIMS OF LEGAL JUSTICE AND EVEN THE PROMPTINGS OF PARTIALITY THE POSSESSION OF THE FURNITURE WOULD NOT BE IN ANY SENSE A PROVISION HE OUGHT TO HAVE IT THE POOR BOY
SOMEWHERE OUT OF THAT A DIVISION ON THE OTHER HAND HOWEVER CAREFULLY MADE MIGHT GIVE SOME CAUSE OF OFFENCE TO WINNIE NO STEVIE MUST REMAIN DESTITUTE AND DEPENDENT
HIS EXPRESSION WAS PROUD APPREHENSIVE AND CONCENTRATED LIKE THAT OF A SMALL CHILD ENTRUSTED FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH A BOX OF MATCHES
WHOSE ENUNCIATION WAS CARESSING AND SLOW APROPOS OF THIS EXPLOSION IN GREENWICH PARK IT APPEARS WE ALL OUGHT TO QUAKE IN OUR SHOES AT WHAT'S COMING IF THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT SUPPRESSED ALL OVER THE WORLD I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS SUCH A GRAVE AFFAIR
YOU KNOW YOU DO GET YOURSELF VERY UNTIDY WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE STEVIE MISTER VERLOC WAS ALREADY GONE SOME WAY DOWN THE STREET THUS IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER MOTHER'S HEROIC PROCEEDINGS AND OF HER BROTHER'S ABSENCE ON THIS VILLEGIATURE
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN MORALITY MY LINE OF INQUIRY WOULD APPEAR TO HIM AN AWFUL PERVERSION OF DUTY FOR HIM THE PLAIN DUTY IS TO FASTEN THE GUILT UPON AS MANY PROMINENT ANARCHISTS AS HE CAN
NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN A BURGLAR BUT NO BURGLAR WOULD HAVE RECEIVED SUCH A HEAVY SENTENCE THE DEATH OF THE CONSTABLE HAD MADE HIM MISERABLE AT HEART BUT THE FAILURE OF THE PLOT ALSO HE DID NOT CONCEAL EITHER OF THESE SENTIMENTS
WOULD HAVE SERVED HIS REPUTATION BETTER ON THE OTHER HAND HE ADMITTED TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PRESERVE ONE'S REPUTATION IF RANK OUTSIDERS WERE GOING TO TAKE A HAND IN THE BUSINESS OUTSIDERS ARE THE BANE OF THE POLICE AS OF OTHER PROFESSIONS
HE HAD HIS OWN CRUSADING INSTINCTS THIS AFFAIR WHICH IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER DISGUSTED CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT SEEMED TO HIM A PROVIDENTIALLY GIVEN STARTING POINT FOR A CRUSADE HE HAD IT MUCH AT HEART TO BEGIN
HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY CURIOUS BEFORE THE PUBLIC HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO VINDICATE THE EFFICIENCY OF HIS DEPARTMENT
AND A LADY WEEPING BESIDE HIM AND WHEN I SAW HER MAKING SUCH DOLE I ASKED HER WHO SLEW HER LORD SIR SHE SAID THE FALSEST KNIGHT OF THE WORLD NOW LIVING AND HE IS THE MOST VILLAIN THAT EVER MAN HEARD SPEAK OF
AND SO HE PASSED THROUGH A GREAT FOREST INTO A PLAIN TILL HE WAS WARE OF A PRIORY
WE DEMANDED BATTLE OF YOU AND YET WE KNEW NOT YOUR NAME NEVERTHELESS BY SAINT CROSS SAID SIR UWAINE HE IS A STRONG KNIGHT AT MINE ADVICE AS ANY IS NOW LIVING THEN SIR TRISTRAM DEPARTED
FOR THEY DID THEMSELVES GREAT SHAME SO MANY KNIGHTS TO FIGHT WITH ONE
THEREFORE THOU ART MORE THAN ANY STONE AND NEVER WOULDST THOU BE MADE NESH NOR BY WATER NOR BY FIRE AND THAT IS THE HEAT OF THE HOLY GHOST MAY NOT ENTER IN THEE
AND GO SAFE AND THAT THE QUEEN SHALL HAVE HER LIBERTY AS SHE HAD BEFORE AND NEVER FOR NO THING THAT HATH BEEN SURMISED AFORE THIS TIME SHE NEVER FROM THIS DAY STAND IN NO PERIL FOR ELSE SAID SIR LAUNCELOT
THEN THE QUEEN MADE GREAT CHEER O JESU SAID KING ARTHUR I MARVEL FOR WHAT CAUSE YE SIR LAUNCELOT WENT OUT OF YOUR MIND I AND MANY OTHERS DEEM IT WAS FOR THE LOVE OF FAIR ELAINE THE DAUGHTER OF KING PELLES BY WHOM YE ARE NOISED THAT YE HAVE GOTTEN A CHILD AND HIS NAME IS GALAHAD
AND THEN THEY DRESSED THEIR SHIELDS AND SPEARS AND CAME TOGETHER WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT OF THEIR HORSES AND THEY MET SO FIERCELY THAT BOTH THEIR HORSES AND KNIGHTS FELL TO THE EARTH AND AS FAST AS THEY MIGHT
THEN SIR LAUNCELOT LOOKED BY HIM AND SAW AN OLD CHAPEL AND THERE HE WEENED TO HAVE FOUND PEOPLE AND SIR LAUNCELOT TIED HIS HORSE TILL A TREE AND THERE HE DID OFF HIS SHIELD AND HUNG IT UPON A TREE AND THEN WENT TO THE CHAPEL DOOR AND FOUND IT WASTE AND BROKEN AND WITHIN HE FOUND A FAIR ALTAR
THEN SIR LAUNCELOT HURTLED HERE AND THERE AND RACED AND PULLED OFF HELMS SO THAT AT THAT TIME THERE MIGHT NONE SIT HIM A BUFFET WITH SPEAR NOR WITH SWORD AND SIR GARETH DID SUCH DEEDS OF ARMS THAT ALL MEN MARVELLED WHAT KNIGHT HE WAS WITH THE GREEN SHIELD
FOR EVER A WORSHIPFUL MAN WILL BE LOATH TO SEE A WORSHIPFUL MAN SHAMED AND HE THAT IS OF NO WORSHIP AND FARETH WITH COWARDICE NEVER SHALL HE SHOW GENTLENESS NOR NO MANNER OF GOODNESS WHERE HE SEETH A MAN IN ANY DANGER
AND THEN HE WENT WITHOUT THE TOWN AND FOUND IN MIDST OF THE WAY A FIG TREE THE WHICH WAS RIGHT FAIR AND WELL GARNISHED OF LEAVES BUT FRUIT HAD IT NONE THEN OUR LORD CURSED THE TREE THAT BARE NO FRUIT THAT BETOKENETH THE FIG TREE UNTO JERUSALEM THAT HAD LEAVES AND NO FRUIT
WHAT IS BEST TO DO AWAKE HIM
AN EVER YE ESCAPE HIS HANDS RIGHT SO SIR TRISTRAM
WHATSOMEVER THOU BE I REQUIRE THEE UPON THE HIGH ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD TELL ME THY TRUE NAME THEN HE SAID
AND MOUNTED UP LIGHTLY AND FOLLOWED AFTER SIR TRISTRAM AND WHEN SIR TRISTRAM SAW THEM COME SO FAST AFTER HIM HE RETURNED WITH HIS HORSE TO THEM AND ASKED THEM WHAT THEY WOULD
SIR KNIGHT COME ON YOUR PERIL THEN EITHER DRESSED TO OTHER AND CAME TOGETHER AS FAST AS THEIR HORSES MIGHT RUN AND GALAHAD SMOTE HIM SO THAT HIS SPEAR WENT THROUGH HIS SHOULDER AND SMOTE HIM DOWN OFF HIS HORSE AND IN THE FALLING GALAHAD'S SPEAR BRAKE
AND ALL THINE EVIL WILL GOD FORGIVE IT YOU AND I DO AND HERE WITHIN THIS MILE IS THE SUFFRAGAN OF CARLISLE THAT SHALL GIVE YOU THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM
IT IS NOT LONG AGO SITHEN I SMOTE YOU TO THE EARTH AT YOUR OWN REQUEST AND DESIRE I WOULD HAVE RIDDEN BY YOU BUT YE WOULD NOT SUFFER ME AND NOW MESEEMETH YE WOULD DO MORE BATTLE WITH ME
AND THIS IS THE CAUSE WHY I AM SO LOATH TO HAVE ADO WITH YOU FOR I MUST FIGHT WITHIN THESE THREE DAYS WITH A GOOD KNIGHT AND AS VALIANT AS ANY IS NOW LIVING AND IF I BE HURT I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO DO BATTLE WITH HIM
HAVE HAD GREAT TRAVAIL AND THEREFORE YE ARE A VILLAINOUS KNIGHT TO ASK BATTLE OF ME CONSIDERING MY GREAT TRAVAIL HOWBEIT I WILL NOT FAIL YOU
MY LORD SIR TRISTRAM SAID SIR GALLERON YOUR RENOWN AND WORSHIP IS WELL KNOWN THROUGH MANY REALMS AND GOD SAVE YOU THIS DAY FROM SHENSHIP AND SHAME THEN SIR TRISTRAM UNARMED GALLERON THE WHICH WAS A NOBLE KNIGHT AND HAD DONE MANY DEEDS OF ARMS
AND THEN SIR GAWAINE ASKED HIM HIS NAME THEN HE SAID MY NAME IS SIR TRISTRAM AND SO EITHER TOLD OTHER THEIR NAMES AND THEN DEPARTED SIR TRISTRAM AND RODE HIS WAY
WHAT ADVENTURE IS BEFALLEN ME AND THEREWITH SIR LAUNCELOT KNEELED DOWN AND YIELDED HIM UP HIS SWORD AND THEREWITH SIR TRISTRAM KNEELED ADOWN AND YIELDED HIM UP HIS SWORD
BOUNDEN WITH GOLD RICHLY AND SAID SIR BLOW THIS HORN WHICH WILL BE HEARD TWO MILE ABOUT THIS CASTLE WHEN SIR GALAHAD HAD BLOWN THE HORN HE SET HIM DOWN UPON A BED THEN CAME A PRIEST TO GALAHAD AND SAID
I SHALL FIRST BEGIN AT SANDWICH AND THERE I SHALL GO IN MY SHIRT BAREFOOT AND AT EVERY TEN MILES END I WILL FOUND AND GAR MAKE AN HOUSE OF RELIGION OF WHAT ORDER THAT YE WILL ASSIGN ME WITH AN WHOLE CONVENT TO SING AND READ
THEN CAME KING ARTHUR WITH HIS NINE KNIGHTS WITH HIM AND SIR LAUNCELOT ENCOUNTERED WITH SIR GAWAINE AND GAVE HIM SUCH A BUFFET THAT THE ARSON OF HIS SADDLE BRAST AND SIR GAWAINE FELL TO THE EARTH THEN SIR GARETH ENCOUNTERED WITH THE GOOD KNIGHT SIR PALOMIDES
SO WHEN THE HOLY VESSEL HAD BEEN THERE A GREAT WHILE IT WENT UNTO THE CHAPEL WITH THE CHANDELIER AND THE LIGHT SO THAT LAUNCELOT WIST NOT WHERE IT WAS BECOME FOR HE WAS OVERTAKEN WITH SIN THAT HE HAD NO POWER TO RISE AGAIN THE HOLY VESSEL
AND ON EVERY COURSER SAT A YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND ALL THEY WERE ARRAYED IN GREEN VELVET WITH SARPS OF GOLD ABOUT THEIR QUARTERS AND THE HORSE TRAPPED IN THE SAME WISE DOWN TO THE HEELS WITH MANY OUCHES
BUT NOWADAYS MEN CAN NOT LOVE SEVEN NIGHT BUT THEY MUST HAVE ALL THEIR DESIRES THAT LOVE MAY NOT ENDURE BY REASON FOR WHERE THEY BE SOON ACCORDED AND HASTY HEAT SOON IT COOLETH RIGHT SO FARETH LOVE NOWADAYS SOON HOT SOON COLD THIS IS NO STABILITY
AND THERE KING ARTHUR BRAKE HIS SPEAR ALL TO PIECES UPON SIR TRISTRAM'S SHIELD BUT SIR TRISTRAM HIT ARTHUR AGAIN THAT HORSE AND MAN FELL TO THE EARTH AND THERE WAS KING ARTHUR WOUNDED ON THE LEFT SIDE
I SEE WELL BY HIS RIDING AND BY HIS GREAT STROKES AND THE OTHER KNIGHT IN THE SAME COLOURS IS THE GOOD YOUNG KNIGHT SIR LAVAINE ALSO THAT KNIGHT WITH THE GREEN SHIELD IS MY BROTHER SIR GARETH AND YET HE HATH DISGUISED HIMSELF
THE KNIGHT THAT HAD TRESPASSED AND IN THREE DAYS SIR LAUNCELOT SMOTE DOWN FIVE HUNDRED KNIGHTS AND EVER AS SIR ECTOR AND SIR PERCIVALE TOLD THESE TALES OF SIR LAUNCELOT
THOU HAST A FAIR GRACE OF ME THIS DAY THAT I SHOULD RESCUE THEE AND THOU ART THE MAN IN THE WORLD THAT I MOST HATE BUT NOW MAKE THEE READY FOR I WILL DO BATTLE WITH THEE
THE WHICH WAS BROUGHT INTO THIS LAND BY JOSEPH ARAMATHIE
THEN SIR TRISTRAM SPAKE AND SAID THOU COWARD KNIGHT WHAT CASTEST THOU TO DO WHY WILT THOU NOT DO BATTLE WITH ME FOR HAVE THOU NO DOUBT I SHALL ENDURE ALL THY MALICE AH SIR TRISTRAM SAID PALOMIDES
I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO MY BATTLE WHICH I PROMISED AS FOR THAT SAID SAGRAMORE MAUGRE YOUR HEAD YE SHALL JOUST WITH US OR YE PASS FROM US WELL SAID SIR TRISTRAM
AND MY LORD SAID OF ARTHUR'S COURT THEREFORE SAID THE STRONG KNIGHT I WILL JOUST WITH THEE
AND THERE IT WAS KNOWN HOW LONG SIR LAUNCELOT WAS WITH SIR BLIANT AND WITH SIR SELIVANT AND HOW HE FIRST MET WITH THEM AND HOW HE DEPARTED FROM THEM BECAUSE OF A BOAR AND HOW THE HERMIT HEALED SIR LAUNCELOT OF HIS GREAT WOUND
AND HE SMOTE US BOTH DOWN WITH ONE SPEAR AND HURT US RIGHT SORE BY MY FAITH SAID SIR GAWAINE
WHY SAID GALAHAD WILL YE ALL HAVE ADO WITH ME AT ONCE
AND EITHER KISSED OTHER AN HUNDRED TIMES AND THEN ANON AFTER THEY TOOK OFF THEIR HELMS AND RODE TO CAMELOT
AND THEREFORE AN YE BE WISE DEPART ON YOUR WAY AS YE CAME FOR THIS KNIGHT SHALL NOT ESCAPE US THAT WERE PITY SAID SIR TRISTRAM THAT SO GOOD A KNIGHT AS HE IS SHOULD BE SLAIN SO COWARDLY
AND RODE HIS WAY EARLY ON THE MORN AND BY SUDDEN ADVENTURE SIR TRISTRAM MET WITH SIR SAGRAMORE LE DESIROUS AND WITH SIR DODINAS LE SAVAGE
THEN SIR LAUNCELOT SMOTE DOWN SIR AGRAVAINE AND SIR GAHERIS AND SIR MORDRED AND SIR GARETH SMOTE DOWN SIR KAY
TO THE NUMBER OF A THOUSAND AND SHE AND SIR LAUNCELOT WERE CLOTHED IN WHITE CLOTH OF GOLD TISSUE AND RIGHT SO AS YE HAVE HEARD AS THE FRENCH BOOK MAKETH MENTION HE RODE WITH THE QUEEN FROM JOYOUS GARD TO CARLISLE
MY JOURNEY SEEMED TEDIOUS VERY TEDIOUS FIFTY MILES ONE DAY A NIGHT SPENT AT AN INN FIFTY MILES THE NEXT DAY
I FEARED NOTHING BUT INTERRUPTION AND THAT CAME TOO SOON
DEVELOPED FOR ME IN THESE REGIONS THE SAME ATTRACTION AS FOR THEM WOUND ROUND MY FACULTIES THE SAME SPELL THAT ENTRANCED THEIRS INDOORS WE AGREED EQUALLY WELL
AND I THOUGHT MISTER REED'S SPIRIT HARASSED BY THE WRONGS OF HIS SISTER'S CHILD MIGHT QUIT ITS ABODE WHETHER IN THE CHURCH VAULT OR IN THE UNKNOWN WORLD OF THE DEPARTED AND RISE BEFORE ME IN THIS CHAMBER
AT THE BOTTOM WAS A SUNK FENCE
AS MY SISTERS HAD EVIDENTLY BECOME ATTACHED TO YOU AND YOUR SOCIETY GAVE THEM UNUSUAL PLEASURE I DEEMED IT INEXPEDIENT TO BREAK IN ON YOUR MUTUAL COMFORT TILL THEIR APPROACHING DEPARTURE FROM MARSH END SHOULD RENDER YOURS NECESSARY
AND MORE EDEN LIKE IT WAS FULL OF TREES IT BLOOMED WITH FLOWERS A VERY HIGH WALL SHUT IT OUT FROM THE COURT ON ONE SIDE ON THE OTHER A BEECH AVENUE SCREENED IT FROM THE LAWN
BUT THE MOTHER'S HEART TURNED FROM AN OPINION SO HARSH
THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF TAKING A WALK THAT DAY WE HAD BEEN WANDERING INDEED IN THE LEAFLESS SHRUBBERY AN HOUR IN THE MORNING BUT SINCE DINNER MISSUS REED WHEN THERE WAS NO COMPANY DINED EARLY THE COLD WINTER WIND HAD BROUGHT WITH IT
OF HIM WHO WOULD PRESENTLY DEAL IT
WHICH IS SUCH THAT I HAVE MADE IT MY LAW OF ACTION ADELE MUST GO TO SCHOOL AND YOU MISS EYRE MUST GET A NEW SITUATION YES SIR
I LEFT REMINISCENCE FOR ANTICIPATION I WAS GOING BACK TO THORNFIELD BUT HOW LONG WAS I TO STAY THERE NOT LONG OF THAT I WAS SURE
AND APPEARING BEFORE THE EYES OF BELATED TRAVELLERS I RETURNED TO MY STOOL SUPERSTITION WAS WITH ME AT THAT MOMENT BUT IT WAS NOT YET HER HOUR FOR COMPLETE VICTORY MY BLOOD WAS STILL WARM
REGRETS TO WHICH I HAVE LATTERLY AVOIDED REFERRING BUT WHICH POSSESSED ME AND TYRANNISED OVER ME RUTHLESSLY MEANTIME A MONTH WAS GONE
CONVENTIONALITY IS NOT MORALITY SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NOT RELIGION TO ATTACK THE FIRST IS NOT TO ASSAIL THE LAST TO PLUCK THE MASK FROM THE FACE OF THE PHARISEE IS NOT TO LIFT AN IMPIOUS HAND TO THE CROWN OF THORNS
AND SOME MINUTES OF APPARENTLY MOURNFUL MEDITATION BUT BESIDES HIS FREQUENT ABSENCES THERE WAS ANOTHER BARRIER TO FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM HE SEEMED OF A RESERVED AN ABSTRACTED AND EVEN OF A BROODING NATURE
GEORGIANA SAID SHE DREADED BEING LEFT ALONE WITH ELIZA FROM HER SHE GOT NEITHER SYMPATHY IN HER DEJECTION SUPPORT IN HER FEARS NOR AID IN HER PREPARATIONS
BUT HATE AS IT WILL IT IS INDEBTED TO HIM AHAB DID NOT LIKE MICAIAH BECAUSE HE NEVER PROPHESIED GOOD CONCERNING HIM BUT EVIL
HE EXPRESSED ONCE AND BUT ONCE IN MY HEARING A STRONG SENSE OF THE RUGGED CHARM OF THE HILLS AND AN INBORN AFFECTION FOR THE DARK ROOF AND HOARY WALLS HE CALLED HIS HOME
WARBLING IN A WOOD HALF A MILE OFF NO MOVING FORM IS VISIBLE NO COMING STEP
HILLO HE CRIES AND HE PUTS UP HIS BOOK AND HIS PENCIL THERE YOU ARE COME ON IF YOU PLEASE I SUPPOSE I DO COME ON
LOOK AT HIS WINGS SAID HE HE REMINDS ME RATHER OF A WEST INDIAN INSECT ONE DOES NOT OFTEN SEE SO LARGE AND GAY A NIGHT ROVER IN ENGLAND THERE
HE WAS STANDING AMONG THE BEDS AT A YARD OR TWO DISTANT FROM WHERE I HAD TO PASS THE MOTH APPARENTLY ENGAGED HIM I SHALL GET BY VERY WELL I MEDITATED
WITH SUBDUED BROKEN REFLECTIONS VARYING THE GLOSS OF ITS PANELS TO MY LEFT WERE THE MUFFLED WINDOWS A GREAT LOOKING GLASS BETWEEN THEM REPEATED THE VACANT MAJESTY OF THE BED AND ROOM I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER THEY HAD LOCKED THE DOOR
A BED SUPPORTED ON MASSIVE PILLARS OF MAHOGANY
AND YOU ARE PARTED FROM HIM FOR EVER AND THEN I STRANGLED A NEW BORN AGONY A DEFORMED THING WHICH I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF TO OWN AND REAR AND RAN ON
AND FOR THE LOOK YOU HAD IN YOUR EYES TWO MINUTES SINCE YOU RAT
AND HUMBLED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY PHYSICAL INFERIORITY TO ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA REED THE SAID ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA WERE NOW CLUSTERED ROUND THEIR MAMA IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE LAY RECLINED ON A SOFA BY THE FIRESIDE
I HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO THESE WORDS THEY WERE NOT NEW TO ME MY VERY FIRST RECOLLECTIONS OF EXISTENCE INCLUDED HINTS OF THE SAME KIND THIS REPROACH OF MY DEPENDENCE HAD BECOME A VAGUE SING SONG IN MY EAR
DID SHE SAY THAT TO ME DID YOU HEAR HER ELIZA AND GEORGIANA WON'T I TELL MAMA BUT FIRST HE RAN HEADLONG AT ME I FELT HIM GRASP MY HAIR AND MY SHOULDER HE HAD CLOSED WITH A DESPERATE THING
MISSUS REED IMPATIENT OF MY NOW FRANTIC ANGUISH AND WILD SOBS ABRUPTLY THRUST ME BACK AND LOCKED ME IN WITHOUT FARTHER PARLEY I HEARD HER SWEEPING AWAY AND SOON AFTER SHE WAS GONE I SUPPOSE I HAD A SPECIES OF FIT
SCARCELY LESS PROMINENT WAS AN AMPLE CUSHIONED EASY CHAIR NEAR THE HEAD OF THE BED ALSO WHITE WITH A FOOTSTOOL BEFORE IT AND LOOKING AS I THOUGHT LIKE A PALE THRONE THIS ROOM WAS CHILL BECAUSE IT SELDOM HAD A FIRE
TO ONE WITH WHOM YOU HAVE NO SYMPATHY WHOM I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU TRULY LOVE FOR I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD YOU SNEER AT HER I WOULD SCORN SUCH A UNION THEREFORE I AM BETTER THAN YOU LET ME GO
AGAINST THE VOICE THAT KEPT WARNING ME OF NEAR SEPARATION AND COMING GRIEF
BITTERNUTT LODGE CONNAUGHT IRELAND YOU'LL LIKE IRELAND I THINK THEY'RE SUCH WARM HEARTED PEOPLE THERE THEY SAY IT IS A LONG WAY OFF SIR
THE HAY WAS ALL GOT IN THE FIELDS ROUND THORNFIELD WERE GREEN AND SHORN THE ROADS WHITE AND BAKED THE TREES WERE IN THEIR DARK PRIME HEDGE AND WOOD
I TURN TO ANOTHER CLASS A SMALL ONE SO FAR AS I KNOW BUT NOT THEREFORE TO BE OVERLOOKED I MEAN THE TIMOROUS OR CARPING FEW WHO DOUBT THE TENDENCY OF SUCH BOOKS AS JANE EYRE IN WHOSE EYES WHATEVER IS UNUSUAL IS WRONG
I LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY ENJOYED DELIGHTED ME WHAT THEY APPROVED I REVERENCED THEY LOVED THEIR SEQUESTERED HOME I TOO IN THE GREY SMALL ANTIQUE STRUCTURE
ELIZA WHO WAS HEADSTRONG AND SELFISH WAS RESPECTED GEORGIANA WHO HAD A SPOILED TEMPER A VERY ACRID SPITE
WITH WHAT I REVERENCE WITH WHAT I DELIGHT IN WITH AN ORIGINAL A VIGOROUS AN EXPANDED MIND I HAVE KNOWN YOU MISTER ROCHESTER AND IT STRIKES ME WITH TERROR
PLEADED BESSIE LET HER GO WAS THE ONLY ANSWER LOOSE BESSIE'S HAND CHILD YOU CANNOT SUCCEED IN GETTING OUT BY THESE MEANS BE ASSURED I ABHOR ARTIFICE PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN
OUR NATURES DOVETAILED MUTUAL AFFECTION OF THE STRONGEST KIND WAS THE RESULT THEY DISCOVERED I COULD DRAW THEIR PENCILS AND COLOUR BOXES WERE IMMEDIATELY AT MY SERVICE MY SKILL GREATER IN THIS ONE POINT THAN THEIRS SURPRISED AND CHARMED THEM
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS IN HER WAS THE REPLY I'VE TOLD MISSIS OFTEN MY OPINION ABOUT THE CHILD
WHAT I HAD PERUSED DURING THE DAY THOUGHT FITTED THOUGHT OPINION MET OPINION WE COINCIDED IN SHORT PERFECTLY IF IN OUR TRIO THERE WAS A SUPERIOR AND A LEADER IT WAS DIANA PHYSICALLY SHE FAR EXCELLED ME
YOU ARE A DEPENDENT MAMA SAYS YOU HAVE NO MONEY YOUR FATHER LEFT YOU NONE YOU OUGHT TO BEG AND NOT TO LIVE HERE WITH GENTLEMEN'S CHILDREN LIKE US AND EAT THE SAME MEALS WE DO
AND IN THOSE LAST WORDS LIES THE SECRET OF THE RED ROOM THE SPELL WHICH KEPT IT SO LONELY IN SPITE OF ITS GRANDEUR MISTER REED HAD BEEN DEAD NINE YEARS IT WAS IN THIS CHAMBER HE BREATHED HIS LAST
THAT RESERVOIR OF FROST AND SNOW WHERE FIRM FIELDS OF ICE THE ACCUMULATION OF CENTURIES OF WINTERS
BUT RATHER HOW THEY WERE TO GET HOLD OF IT THE HUNTERS HAD SCARCELY ENTERED THE BUSHES WHEN THEY SAW TOP ENGAGED IN A STRUGGLE WITH AN ANIMAL WHICH HE WAS HOLDING BY THE EAR
AND YOU MY BOY GIVE US YOUR OPINION SAID THE ENGINEER TURNING TO HERBERT OH CRIED HERBERT HIS COUNTENANCE FULL OF ANIMATION HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO THANK HIM HE WHO SAVED YOU FIRST AND WHO HAS NOW SAVED US
THE SETTLERS ASKED IF GRANITE HOUSE WAS INHABITED OR NOT AND YET THE POSITION OF THE LADDER WAS SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT IT WAS IT WAS ALSO CERTAIN THAT THE INHABITANTS WHOEVER THEY MIGHT BE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE BUT HOW WERE THEY TO BE GOT AT
HE MUST NOT COME RETURNED CYRUS HARDING QUICKLY HE WOULD BE MURDERED ON THE ROAD IT IS VERY PROBABLE HOWEVER THAT HE WILL ATTEMPT TO REJOIN US AH IF THE TELEGRAPH STILL ACTED HE MIGHT BE WARNED BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOW
NO MY DEAR SPILETT BUT YOU SEE THAT IF IT IS CERTAIN THAT A HUMAN BEING SET FOOT ON THE ISLAND IT APPEARS NO LESS CERTAIN THAT HE HAS NOW LEFT IT THEN IF I UNDERSTAND YOU RIGHT CAPTAIN SAID HERBERT THE VESSEL HAS LEFT AGAIN
THEY WOULD HAVE IMPERTURBABLY REPLIED CYRUS IS HERE WHILE IN THE PALANQUIN HOWEVER THE ENGINEER HAD AGAIN RELAPSED INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS WHICH THE JOLTING TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED DURING HIS JOURNEY HAD BROUGHT ON
AND IT MIGHT NOW BE HOPED THAT THIS TERRIBLE WOUND WOULD NOT INVOLVE ANY CATASTROPHE PENCROFT FELT THE SWELLING OF HIS HEART GRADUALLY SUBSIDE HE WAS LIKE A SISTER OF MERCY LIKE A MOTHER BY THE BED OF HER CHILD
EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THE FIRST ORDER OF THE QUADRUMANA WHETHER THIS WAS A CHIMPANZEE AN ORANGOUTANG OR A GORILLA HE TOOK RANK AMONG THE ANTHROPOID APES WHO ARE SO CALLED FROM THEIR RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN RACE
WERE TO RETURN TO THE FOREST RENEW THEIR STORE OF WOOD AND LAY VIOLENT HANDS ON EVERY CREATURE FEATHERED OR HAIRY WHICH MIGHT COME WITHIN THEIR REACH THEY SET OUT ACCORDINGLY ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
AND HERBERT DESCRIBED THEM TO HIS COMPANIONS WHO FEASTED ON THEM COME SAID PENCROFT SEA WEED BY WAY OF BREAD RAW MUSSELS FOR MEAT AND ALMONDS FOR DESSERT THAT'S CERTAINLY A GOOD DINNER FOR THOSE
THEY ARE SIX AND WELL ARMED IF THEY EACH LAY HID IN A CORNER AND EACH FIRED AT ONE OF US THEY WOULD SOON BE MASTERS OF THE COLONY WHY HAVE THEY NOT DONE SO SAID HERBERT NO DOUBT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THEIR INTEREST TO DO IT BESIDES WE ARE SIX ALSO
FOR HE COULD NOT KNOW OF THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF WHICH HERBERT HAS BEEN A VICTIM AND CONSEQUENTLY WOULD NEVER THINK OF OUR BEING IMPRISONED IN THE CORRAL OH I WISH THAT HE WAS THERE AT GRANITE HOUSE CRIED PENCROFT
WAS JUST GOING TO FELL THE PIG WHEN THE LATTER TEARING ITSELF FROM TOP'S TEETH BY WHICH IT WAS ONLY HELD BY THE TIP OF ITS EAR UTTERED A VIGOROUS GRUNT RUSHED UPON HERBERT ALMOST OVERTHREW HIM AND DISAPPEARED IN THE WOOD
ARE WE TO LEAVE THEM TO OVERRUN OUR FORESTS OUR FIELDS OUR PLANTATIONS THESE PIRATES ARE REGULAR JAGUARS AND IT SEEMS TO ME WE OUGHT NOT TO HESITATE TO TREAT THEM AS SUCH
OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL OF THE SAME NATURE THAT THE WATER OF THE CHANNEL HAD BEEN RAISED LIKE A DOME THE BOTTOM OF THE BRIG CRUSHED IN AND SHE HAD SUNK INSTANTLY THE DAMAGE DONE TO HER HULL
ABOUT THIRTY MILES REPLIED THE ENGINEER IF WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CURVINGS OF THE COAST THIRTY MILES RETURNED SPILETT THAT WOULD BE A LONG DAY'S MARCH NEVERTHELESS I THINK THAT WE SHOULD RETURN TO GRANITE HOUSE BY THE SOUTH COAST
I KNEW BETTER THAN THAT REPLIED THE SAILOR BUT SUCH A SMALL ARTICLE COULD EASILY DISAPPEAR IN THE TUMBLING ABOUT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH I WOULD RATHER EVEN HAVE LOST MY PIPE CONFOUND THE BOX WHERE CAN IT BE LOOK HERE THE TIDE IS GOING DOWN SAID HERBERT
THEN APPROACHING THE ORANG WELL OLD BOY HE ASKED HOW ARE YOU THE ORANG REPLIED BY A LITTLE GRUNT WHICH DID NOT SHOW ANY ANGER YOU WISH TO JOIN THE COLONY AGAIN ASKED THE SAILOR YOU ARE GOING TO ENTER THE SERVICE OF CAPTAIN CYRUS HARDING
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO SEIZE IT BEFORE THE RAPID CURRENT SHOULD HAVE SWEPT IT AWAY OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER
THERE WAS NO FEAR OF DAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT THICK MASS OF GRANITE MANY NATURAL EXCAVATIONS SITUATED IN THE UPPER PASSAGE WERE ENLARGED EITHER BY PICK AXE OR MINE AND GRANITE HOUSE THUS BECAME A GENERAL WAREHOUSE
WHAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ON THE WEST GIDEON SPILETT PROPOSED TO CONTINUE THE EXPLORATION THAT THE QUESTION OF THE SUPPOSED WRECK MIGHT BE COMPLETELY SETTLED AND HE ASKED AT WHAT DISTANCE CLAW CAPE MIGHT BE FROM THE EXTREMITY OF THE PENINSULA
IT DID NOT APPEAR NECESSARY TO GIDEON SPILETT THAT A FRESH FLOW OF BLOOD SHOULD BE CAUSED BY BATHING THEM IN TEPID WATER AND COMPRESSING THEIR LIPS THE HEMORRHAGE HAD BEEN VERY ABUNDANT AND HERBERT WAS ALREADY TOO MUCH ENFEEBLED BY THE LOSS OF BLOOD
THE REPORTER THEREFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO SIMPLY BATHE THE TWO WOUNDS WITH COLD WATER HERBERT WAS PLACED ON HIS LEFT SIDE AND WAS MAINTAINED IN THAT POSITION HE MUST NOT BE MOVED SAID GIDEON SPILETT
AND THE TEARS WHICH HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN TOLD TOO CLEARLY THAT HE HAD LOST ALL HOPE THE REPORTER RECOUNTED ALL THAT THEY HAD DONE IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO RECOVER CYRUS HARDING
WHO KNEW WHEN TO BE SILENT RAN IN ADVANCE THE CART CAME OUT THE GATE WAS RECLOSED AND THE ONAGER LED BY PENCROFT ADVANCED AT A SLOW PACE CERTAINLY
CYRUS HARDING AND HIS COMPANIONS SLEPT LIKE INNOCENT MARMOTS IN THE CAVE WHICH THE JAGUAR HAD SO POLITELY LEFT AT THEIR DISPOSAL
HERBERT THEN THOUGHT OF FASTENING A CORD TO AN ARROW AND SHOOTING THE ARROW SO THAT IT SHOULD PASS BETWEEN THE FIRST ROUNDS OF THE LADDER WHICH HUNG FROM THE THRESHOLD BY MEANS OF THE CORD
NEARLY TWO FEET AND A HALF LONG
THE CONVALESCENCE OF THE YOUNG INVALID WAS REGULARLY PROGRESSING
AS THOSE WHICH ARE EMITTED FROM FLINT WHEN STRUCK IN THE SAME MANNER THE EXPERIMENT THEREFORE DID NOT SUCCEED PENCROFT ALTHOUGH HE HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCEEDING THEN TRIED RUBBING TWO PIECES OF DRY WOOD TOGETHER AS SAVAGES DO
OF COURSE MY BOY REPLIED PENCROFT SO WOULD I AND ALL OF US I AM NOT INQUISITIVE BUT I WOULD GIVE ONE OF MY EYES TO SEE THIS INDIVIDUAL FACE TO FACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE MUST BE HANDSOME TALL STRONG WITH A SPLENDID BEARD RADIANT HAIR
THE ONE WHICH HAD BEEN SEIZED IN THE HALL OF GRANITE HOUSE WAS A GREAT FELLOW SIX FEET HIGH WITH AN ADMIRABLY POPORTIONED FRAME A BROAD CHEST HEAD OF A MODERATE SIZE
I AM OF NEB'S OPINION SAID GIDEON SPILETT BUT THAT IS NO REASON FOR NOT ATTEMPTING THE ADVENTURE WHETHER WE FIND THIS MYSTERIOUS BEING OR NOT WE SHALL AT LEAST HAVE FULFILLED OUR DUTY TOWARDS HIM
THE REPORTER WAS IMMEDIATELY STRUCK BY THE COMPLETE STUPOR IN WHICH HERBERT LAY A STUPOR OWING EITHER TO THE HEMORRHAGE OR TO THE SHOCK THE BALL HAVING STRUCK A BONE WITH SUFFICIENT FORCE TO PRODUCE A VIOLENT CONCUSSION HERBERT WAS DEADLY PALE AND HIS PULSE SO FEEBLE
AFTER ALL THE ISLAND WAS LARGE AND FERTILE IF ANY SENTIMENT OF HONESTY YET REMAINED IN THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEARTS THESE WRETCHES MIGHT PERHAPS BE RECLAIMED WAS IT NOT THEIR INTEREST IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES TO BEGIN A NEW LIFE
BEFORE PUTTING THEIR PROJECT OF EXPLORING THE YET UNKNOWN PARTS OF THE ISLAND INTO EXECUTION THEY WISHED TO GET ALL POSSIBLE WORK FINISHED IT WAS ALSO THE TIME FOR COLLECTING THE VARIOUS VEGETABLES FROM THE TABOR ISLAND PLANTS ALL WAS STOWED AWAY
NO PENCROFT REPLIED CYRUS HARDING NO HE IS NOT DEAD HIS PULSE STILL BEATS HE HAS EVEN UTTERED A MOAN BUT FOR YOUR BOY'S SAKE CALM YOURSELF WE HAVE NEED OF ALL OUR SELF POSSESSION DO NOT MAKE US LOSE IT MY FRIEND
IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE CONVICTS WOULD HAVE YET LEFT THE PLATEAU OF PROSPECT HEIGHTS NEB'S NOTE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN WRITTEN AND SENT AS SOON AS THE CONVICTS HAD SHOWN THEMSELVES THERE NOW THIS NOTE WAS DATED SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND THE ACTIVE ORANG
AND STILL MORE SO THE REPORTER HOWEVER HE KNEW ONE THING THIS WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO PREVENT THE INFLAMMATORY STRANGULATION OF THE INJURED PARTS THEN TO CONTEND WITH THE LOCAL INFLAMMATION AND FEVER WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM THE WOUND PERHAPS MORTAL
CYRUS SAID HE I AM NOT A SURGEON I AM IN TERRIBLE PERPLEXITY YOU MUST AID ME WITH YOUR ADVICE YOUR EXPERIENCE TAKE COURAGE MY FRIEND ANSWERED THE ENGINEER PRESSING THE REPORTER'S HAND JUDGE COOLLY
PENCROFT THEN TWISTED THE PIECE OF PAPER INTO THE SHAPE OF A CONE AS SMOKERS DO IN A HIGH WIND AND POKED IT IN AMONG THE MOSS TAKING A SMALL ROUGH STONE HE WIPED IT CAREFULLY AND WITH A BEATING HEART HOLDING HIS BREATH
AND THE SEAMAN INVITED THE REPORTER TO TAKE HIS SHARE OF THE SUPPER SUCH WAS THE FIRST REPAST OF THE CASTAWAYS ON THIS UNKNOWN COAST THE HARD EGGS WERE EXCELLENT AND AS EGGS CONTAIN EVERYTHING INDISPENSABLE TO MAN'S NOURISHMENT
RUIN HERBERT ON SEEING THE ENGINEER THE REPORTER AND PENCROFT RE ENTER GUESSED THAT THEIR SITUATION WAS AGGRAVATED AND WHEN HE SAW JUP HE NO LONGER DOUBTED THAT SOME MISFORTUNE MENACED GRANITE HOUSE
THEN REPLIED THE ENGINEER HE MUST HAVE SOME NOTE ON HIM PENCROFT RUSHED UP TO THE ORANG
ZOOF BEN ZOOF EJACULATED SERVADAC WHO COULD SCARCELY SHOUT LOUD ENOUGH TO RELIEVE HIS PENT UP FEELINGS
AT SUNRISE EVERY TELESCOPE WAS POINTED WITH KEENEST INTEREST TOWARDS THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION THE LIGHT OF COURSE HAD CEASED TO BE VISIBLE
YES OF FRANCE BUT WHO SHALL DESCRIBE THE FEELINGS OF HECTOR SERVADAC WHEN INSTEAD OF THE CHARMING OUTLINE OF HIS NATIVE LAND HE BEHELD NOTHING BUT A SOLID BOUNDARY OF SAVAGE ROCK
AND BEN ZOOF WHO WAS ESPECIALLY ANXIOUS THAT THE REPOSE WHICH PROMISED TO BE SO BENEFICIAL SHOULD NOT BE DISTURBED FELT CONSIDERABLE ANNOYANCE AT HEARING A LOUD KNOCKING EVIDENTLY OF SOME BLUNT HEAVY INSTRUMENT AGAINST A DOOR THAT HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GALLERY
HE REGARDED EVERY ARGUMENT THAT WAS URGED UPON HIM ONLY AS EVIDENCE OF A PLOT THAT HAD BEEN DEVISED TO DEPRIVE HIM OF HIS GOODS REPUDIATING AS HE DID UTTERLY THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A FRAGMENT HAD BECOME DETACHED FROM THE EARTH
AND TROUSERS OF INVISIBLE GREEN PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE DOOR OF THE COLONEL'S ROOM WHERE HE AND HIS BROTHER OFFICER WERE CONTINUING THEIR GAME RAISING HIS HAND RESPECTFULLY TO HIS CAP
BUT THE FREQUENT VOYAGES MADE BY THE DOBRYNA TO THE SOUTH AND THE REPEATED CONSIGNMENTS OF CORN AND CATTLE SOON SERVED TO MAKE HIM AWARE THAT CAPTAIN SERVADAC AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE REALLY CONTEMPLATING A DEPARTURE FROM GOURBI ISLAND THE MOVEMENT SET HIM THINKING
WAS THAT A NEW COAST HAD BEEN UPHEAVED RIGHT ALONG IN FRONT OF THE COAST OF TRIPOLI THE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION OF WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER STRANGE AND WHICH EXTENDED TO THE NORTH AS FAR AS THE PROPER PLACE OF MALTA AND MALTA CRIED SERVADAC
COULD THEY BE WRONG IN IMAGINING THAT THEY HAD REACHED THE IONIAN ISLANDS WHAT NEW MYSTERY WAS THIS COUNT TIMASCHEFF WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED WITH A MORE RIGOROUS INVESTIGATION WHEN THE ATTENTION OF ALL WAS ARRESTED BY A LOUD OUTCRY TURNING ROUND
THE ENGLISHMEN IN SILENCE BOWED ASSENT CAPTAIN SERVADAC WHO ACCOMPANIES ME CONTINUED THE COUNT HAS BEEN MOST SEVERELY TRIED BY THE DISASTER ENGAGED AS HE WAS IN AN IMPORTANT MISSION AS A STAFF OFFICER IN ALGERIA
IT IS TWELVE YEARS OR MORE SINCE I SAW YOU I HOPE YOU HAVE IMPROVED QUITE A REFORMED CHARACTER SIR I ASSURE YOU SAID SERVADAC SMILING WELL THAT'S AS IT SHOULD BE THAT'S RIGHT SAID THE ASTRONOMER WITH FUSSY IMPORTANCE
AND THE POINT OF THE CONTINENT NEAREST TO THE ISLAND OF SICILY HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL DEVASTATION BEFORE THE OCCURRENCE OF THE RECENT PRODIGY THE BOTTOM OF THE MEDITERRANEAN JUST AT THIS POINT HAD FORMED A SUDDEN RIDGE ACROSS THE STRAITS OF LIBYA
THEN TO DAY SAID THE ASTRONOMER SPEAKING WITH THE GREATEST DELIBERATION TO DAY WE ARE JUST THREE MILLIONS OF LEAGUES AWAY FROM EUROPE THE JEW WAS UTTERLY CRESTFALLEN
THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR IS IN BED AND ASLEEP
NOR SAY ONE SYLLABLE AS TO ITS RESULT AND IT COULD ONLY BE INFERRED FROM THEIR MANNER THAT THEY WERE QUITE SATISFIED WITH WHAT THEY HAD SEEN AND VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MAJOR OLIPHANT WAS OBSERVED TO DRAW UP A LENGTHY DOCUMENT
RECOVERING HIS COMPOSURE IN A DEGREE HE CONTINUED CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT I AM NOT AWARE THAT THIS ISLAND ON WHICH WE FIND YOU IS WHAT REMAINS OF THE IONIAN REPRESENTATIVE REPUBLIC OVER WHICH YOU ENGLISH EXERCISE THE RIGHT OF PROTECTION BUT HAVE NO CLAIM OF GOVERNMENT
AND PORTIONS OF BROKEN STELAE ALL PILED PROMISCUOUSLY TOGETHER WITHOUT ANY PRETENSE TO ARTISTIC ARRANGEMENT THEY MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE ENCLOSURE AND FINDING AN OPEN DOOR THEY PASSED THROUGH AND SOON CAME TO A SECOND DOOR ALSO OPEN WHICH ADMITTED THEM
BETTER THAN THAT CRIED ROSETTE STARTING TO HIS FEET WITH EXCITEMENT HOW WHY
NO LONGER THEN COULD THERE BE ANY DOUBT AS TO THE ANNIHILATION OF A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE COLONY NOT MERELY HAD THERE BEEN A SUBMERSION OF THE LAND BUT THE IMPRESSION WAS MORE AND MORE CONFIRMED
HOWEVER CONFIDENT EVERYONE UPON THE ISLAND MIGHT PROFESS TO BE THAT SUCCOR WOULD BE SENT THEM FROM THEIR NATIVE LAND FOR BRITAIN NEVER ABANDONS ANY OF HER SONS
NOT ONLY HAS MALTA BEEN ENTIRELY LOST BUT OF THE IONIAN ISLANDS THAT WERE UNDER ENGLAND'S PROTECTION THERE SEEMS TO BE BUT LITTLE LEFT
WHILST A THIRD RECESS IMMEDIATELY AT THE BACK MADE A CONVENIENT LITTLE CHAMBER FOR NINA THE SPANIARDS AND THE RUSSIAN SAILORS TOOK UP THEIR SLEEPING QUARTERS IN THE ADJACENT GALLERIES AND FOUND THE TEMPERATURE QUITE COMFORTABLE
SOME OF WHICH WAS BROACHED TO DO HONOR TO THE OCCASION THE HEALTH OF THE GOVERNOR GENERAL WAS DRUNK AS WELL AS THE TOAST SUCCESS TO HIS COUNCIL TO WHICH BEN ZOOF WAS CALLED UPON TO RETURN THANKS THE ENTERTAINMENT PASSED OFF MERRILY
AY MORE THAN THAT REPLIED THE OTHER AWHILE THEY GAZED AT THE SEA AND AT EACH OTHER IN MUTE AMAZEMENT BUT IN THE MIDST OF THEIR PERPLEXITY WHAT SOUND WAS THAT WHICH STARTLED THEM WAS IT MERE FANCY
AND IT WOULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE A COLONY WAS ESTABLISHED ROUND IT THE OFFICERS HAD A SERVANT NAMED KIRKE AND A COMPANY OF TEN SOLDIERS OF THE LINE
WAS NOT STRICTLY SPEAKING THE ONLY LAND THAT WAS VISIBLE FOR ABOUT TWELVE MILES TO THE SOUTH THERE WAS ANOTHER ISLAND APPARENTLY THE VERY COUNTERPART OF WHAT WAS NOW OCCUPIED BY THE ENGLISHMEN
WHAT NEWS CAN YOU GIVE US OF FRANCE ENGLAND OR RUSSIA CONTINUED SERVADAC PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE STOLID RIGIDITY WITH WHICH HIS ADVANCES WERE RECEIVED
OH MY LORD MY LORD WHINED ISAAC YOU MUST HAVE SOME NEWS TO TELL ME NEWS WHAT DO YOU MEAN FROM MY LITTLE TARTAN YONDER I SAW THE YAWL GO OUT FROM THE ROCK HERE ON A JOURNEY
THE FORMAL PRELIMINARIES OF ETIQUETTE BEING THUS COMPLETE THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY OBSTACLE TO A FREER INTERCOURSE THE COLONEL SIGNING TO HIS GUESTS TO FOLLOW
YOUR GRAND RESIDENT LORD HIGH COMMISSIONER HAS NOT MUCH TO CONGRATULATE HIMSELF ABOUT IN THE CONDITION OF CORFU THE ENGLISHMEN WERE MYSTIFIED CORFU DID YOU SAY ASKED MAJOR OLIPHANT YES CORFU I SAID CORFU REPLIED SERVADAC
TELL US HAVE YOU HAD NO COMMUNICATION AT ALL FROM EUROPE NO NEWS OF ANY SORT FROM LONDON HITHERTO NONE WHATEVER REPLIED THE COLONEL ADDING WITH A STATELY EMPHASIS BUT WE SHALL BE SURE TO HAVE TIDINGS FROM ENGLAND BEFORE LONG
UNQUESTIONABLY THE FIRST THAT HAD EVER TAKEN PLACE IN GALLIA THE RUSSIAN SAILORS EXHIBITED SOME OF THEIR NATIONAL DANCES WHICH GAINED CONSIDERABLE APPLAUSE EVEN ALTHOUGH THEY FOLLOWED UPON THE MARVELOUS FANDANGOS OF THE SPANIARDS
AND IN DEFAULT OF THE SMALLER ORDNANCE GENERALLY EMPLOYED FOR THE PURPOSE HAD TO BE BROUGHT INTO REQUISITION FOR THE ROYAL SALUTE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CHARGES HAVING BEEN PROVIDED THE CORPORAL BROUGHT HIS MEN
A FRENCH COLONY I BELIEVE INTERPOSED MAJOR OLIPHANT HALF SHUTTING HIS EYES WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SUPREME INDIFFERENCE SERVADAC WAS ON THE POINT OF MAKING SOME CUTTING RETORT BUT COUNT TIMASCHEFF
THERE WAS A COLLISION MY COMET GRAZED THE EARTH AND THE BITS OF THE EARTH WHICH YOU HAVE NAMED WERE CARRIED CLEAN AWAY THEY WERE ALL FAIRLY BEWILDERED WHERE THEN CRIED SERVADAC EAGERLY WHERE ARE WE
OR SOMETHING QUITE APPROXIMATE UPON THEIR ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS WHEN CAPTAIN PARRY WAS ON MELVILLE ISLAND HE KNEW THE THERMOMETER TO FALL TO FIFTY SIX DEGREES SAID PROCOPE
AND IF IT IS SO WE MUST NOW BE VERY CLOSE TO HER ARCTIC REGIONS IT IS TRUE THAT HER AXIS IS NOT SO MUCH INCLINED AS TO PROLONG DAY AND NIGHT AS AT THE POLES OF THE EARTH
BOTH TIMASCHEFF AND SERVADAC WERE MUCH INTERESTED IN WATCHING THE OPERATIONS AT A SIGN FROM THE LIEUTENANT A SAILOR WHO WAS STATIONED AT THE FOOT OF THE FORE SHROUDS DROPPED THE SOUNDING LEAD INTO THE WATER AND IN REPLY TO PROCOPE'S INQUIRIES REPORTED
MANY AND VARIOUS WERE THE CONJECTURES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DELAY
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO COUNT WASSILI TIMASCHEFF MAJOR SIR JOHN TEMPLE OLIPHANT REPLIED THE COLONEL
MADE RESPIRATION SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT AND THE ASCENT FATIGUING BEFORE THEY HAD REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF SIX HUNDRED FEET THEY NOTICED A SENSIBLE DIMINUTION OF THE TEMPERATURE
THRICE DID THE SOUND REPEAT ITSELF IT WAS QUITE DISTINCT THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE I TOLD YOU SO CRIED THE COLONEL TRIUMPHANTLY I KNEW OUR COUNTRY WOULD NOT FORSAKE US IT IS AN ENGLISH SHIP NO DOUBT
LED THE WAY TO THE APARTMENT OCCUPIED JOINTLY BY HIMSELF AND THE MAJOR WHICH ALTHOUGH ONLY A KIND OF CASEMATE HOLLOWED IN THE ROCK NEVERTHELESS WORE A GENERAL AIR OF COMFORT MAJOR OLIPHANT ACCOMPANIED THEM AND ALL FOUR HAVING
THE MARITIME TOWN OF DELLIS BUILT LIKE ALGIERS AMPHITHEATER WISE HAD TOTALLY DISAPPEARED THE HIGHEST POINTS WERE QUITE INVISIBLE NOT A TRACE ON THE HORIZON WAS LEFT OF THE JURJURA CHAIN THE TOPMOST POINT OF WHICH WAS KNOWN TO HAVE AN ALTITUDE OF MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND FEET
WHICH THE LAPSE OF TIME NEVER FAILS TO WORK A SKILLED GEOLOGIST WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASSIGN THEM THEIR PROPER SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION
THROUGHOUT ALL THE PREPARATIONS WHICH ROUSED EVEN THE SPANIARDS TO ACTIVITY THE JEW STILL INCREDULOUS AND DEAF TO EVERY REPRESENTATION OF THE TRUE STATE OF THINGS INSISTED UPON REMAINING IN THE CREEK AT GOURBI ISLAND
TAXES SUFFICIENT FOR CARRYING ON WAR HE ACCORDINGLY HASTENED TO MAKE PEACE WITH HIS NEIGHBOURS AND THENCEFORTH GAVE HIS WHOLE MIND TO BRITISH POLITICS NOW COMMENCED A NEW ERA
TO TWO PEERS OF THE KINGDOM OF SCOTLAND ONE OF THEM CHARLES MIDDLETON EARL OF MIDDLETON
DISGUSTED AND ALARMED HIM NOTHING WOULD HAVE INDUCED HIM TO PUT THE GREAT SEAL TO A WRIT FOR RAISING SHIPMONEY OR TO GIVE HIS VOICE IN COUNCIL FOR COMMITTING A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT TO THE TOWER ON ACCOUNT OF WORDS SPOKEN IN DEBATE
JAMES HAD LATELY HELD LANGUAGE WHICH ENCOURAGED THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD NOT PATIENTLY SUBMIT TO THE ASCENDANCY OF FRANCE IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD CONSENT TO FORM A CLOSE ALLIANCE WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES AND THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
HIS HUMANITY INGENUOUSNESS AND MODESTY THE MEDIOCRITY OF HIS ABILITIES AND THE DOCILITY WITH WHICH HE SUBMITTED TO THE GUIDANCE OF PERSONS WISER THAN HIMSELF ADMIRABLY QUALIFIED HIM TO BE THE HEAD OF A LIMITED MONARCHY
ONE AFTER ANOTHER PHANTOMS WHICH HAD HAUNTED THE WORLD THROUGH AGES OF DARKNESS FLED BEFORE THE LIGHT ASTROLOGY AND ALCHYMY BECAME JESTS SOON THERE WAS SCARCELY A COUNTY IN WHICH SOME OF THE QUORUM DID NOT SMILE CONTEMPTUOUSLY
IN THIS PAPER WERE SET FORTH WITH A STRENGTH OF LANGUAGE SOMETIMES APPROACHING TO SCURRILITY MANY REAL AND SOME IMAGINARY GRIEVANCES IT WAS HINTED THAT THE LATE KING HAD DIED BY POISON
THE PROLONGED MENTAL AGONY OF THE SUFFERER THE SHAME AND MISERY OF ALL CONNECTED WITH HIM THE STAIN ABIDING EVEN TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION ARE THINGS FAR MORE DREADFUL THAN DEATH ITSELF IN GENERAL IT MAY BE SAFELY AFFIRMED
THAT A LARGE PART OF THE REVENUE WAS RAISED WITHOUT ANY LEGAL AUTHORITY AND THAT PERSONS OBNOXIOUS TO THE GOVERNMENT LANGUISHED FOR YEARS IN PRISON WITHOUT BEING EVER CALLED UPON TO PLEAD BEFORE ANY TRIBUNAL
UNHAPPILY FOR HIM HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF DISPLAYING HIS ADMIRABLE MILITARY TALENTS EXCEPT AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES WHILE HE LIVED HIS POWER STOOD FIRM AN OBJECT OF MINGLED AVERSION ADMIRATION
COULD BE CARRIED INTO EXECUTION THAT INSTRUMENT WAS A STANDING ARMY TO THE FORMING OF SUCH AN ARMY THEREFORE HE DIRECTED ALL THE ENERGY OF HIS STRONG MIND
THAN ALICE LISLE THAN WILLIAM HEWLING THAN ANY OF THE HUNDREDS OF IGNORANT PEASANTS WHOSE SKULLS AND QUARTERS WERE EXPOSED IN SOMERSETSHIRE BUT GREY'S ESTATE WAS LARGE AND WAS STRICTLY ENTAILED HE HAD ONLY A LIFE INTEREST IN HIS PROPERTY
WHO HAD BEEN BROTHER IN LAW OF KING HENRY THE EIGHTH AND PROTECTOR OF THE REALM OF ENGLAND IN THE LIMITATION OF THE DUKEDOM OF SOMERSET THE ELDER SON OF THE PROTECTOR HAD BEEN POSTPONED TO THE YOUNGER SON
ILL QUALIFIED TO CONTEND AGAINST THE GREAT MEN WHO THEN DIRECTED THE ARMS OF HOLLAND
AND TO THE HOUSE OF NASSAU THE NAVAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED PROVINCES WAS CONDUCTED BY FIVE DISTINCT BOARDS OF ADMIRALTY ONE OF THOSE BOARDS SATE AT AMSTERDAM WAS PARTLY NOMINATED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THAT CITY
THEY WERE AS WELL BORN AS HE AND AS WELL EDUCATED THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
WESTMINSTER HALL WAS CROWDED WITH SPECTATORS AMONG WHOM WERE MANY ROMAN CATHOLICS
ONE CHOICE ONLY WAS LEFT THE STUARTS OR THE ARMY THE BANISHED FAMILY HAD COMMITTED GREAT FAULTS BUT IT HAD DEARLY EXPIATED THOSE FAULTS AND HAD UNDERGONE A LONG AND IT MIGHT BE HOPED A SALUTARY TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL OF ADVERSITY
THE JUDGES OF THE COMMON LAW HOLDING THEIR SITUATIONS DURING THE PLEASURE OF THE KING WERE SCANDALOUSLY OBSEQUIOUS
AND TO CLAMOUR FOR PROTECTING LAWS FROM IRELAND THE VICTORIOUS CHIEF
HERE HE COULD NOT HURRY DISSENTERS BEFORE MILITARY TRIBUNALS OR ENJOY AT COUNCIL THE LUXURY OF SEEING THEM SWOON IN THE BOOTS HERE HE COULD NOT DROWN YOUNG GIRLS FOR REFUSING TO TAKE THE ABJURATION
AND COULD ON OCCASION IMITATE NOT UNSUCCESSFULLY THE VITUPERATIVE STYLE OF HIS PATRON THE MINION OF JEFFREYS WAS AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED PREFERRED BY JAMES
HE WAS THE RIGHT HEIR MALE
IT IS PROVED BY THE TESTIMONY OF THE KING'S MOST STRENUOUS SUPPORTERS THAT DURING THIS PART OF HIS REIGN THE PROVISIONS OF THE PETITION OF RIGHT WERE VIOLATED BY HIM NOT OCCASIONALLY BUT CONSTANTLY AND ON SYSTEM
HE WAS DRUNK THEY SAID OR OUT OF HIS MIND WHEN HE WAS TURNED OFF
NO VESTIGE WAS LEFT THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT MADE LAWS FOR SCOTLAND ENGLISH JUDGES HELD ASSIZES IN SCOTLAND EVEN THAT STUBBORN CHURCH WHICH HAS HELD ITS OWN AGAINST SO MANY GOVERNMENTS SCARCE DARED TO UTTER AN AUDIBLE MURMUR
TO SPEAK THE WHOLE TRUTH CONCERNING PENN IS A TASK WHICH REQUIRES SOME COURAGE FOR HE IS RATHER A MYTHICAL THAN A HISTORICAL PERSON RIVAL NATIONS AND HOSTILE SECTS HAVE AGREED IN CANONISING HIM
THE ROYAL DIGNITY MIGHT DESCEND WITH GENERAL ACQUIESCENCE TO HIS POSTERITY THE ABLEST ROYALISTS WERE OF OPINION THAT THESE VIEWS WERE CORRECT AND THAT IF CROMWELL HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO FOLLOW HIS OWN JUDGMENT THE EXILED LINE WOULD NEVER
THE TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD THE PONDERATION OF AIR THE FIXATION OF MERCURY SUCCEEDED TO THAT PLACE IN THE PUBLIC MIND WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY OCCUPIED BY THE CONTROVERSIES OF THE ROTA
OR THAT THE DIGNITY WHICH WAS THE JUST REWARD OF HIS PERSONAL MERIT SHOULD BE DECLARED HEREDITARY IN HIS FAMILY
ALL CLASSES WERE HURRIED ALONG BY THE PREVAILING SENTIMENT
NAMED BY THE OFFICERS ASSUMED THE DIRECTION OF AFFAIRS
YET WERE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS STILL IMPOSED ON HIM BY THE VERY ARMY TO WHICH HE OWED HIS IMMENSE AUTHORITY THAT SINGULAR BODY OF MEN WAS FOR THE MOST PART COMPOSED OF ZEALOUS REPUBLICANS
HE HAD A STRONG SENSE OF RELIGIOUS DUTY AND A FERVENT DESIRE TO PROMOTE THE HAPPINESS OF MANKIND ON ONE OR TWO POINTS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE HE HAD NOTIONS MORE CORRECT THAN WERE IN HIS DAY
TO ESTABLISH BY THEIR AID A DICTATORSHIP SUCH AS NO KING HAD EVER EXERCISED BUT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THEIR AID WOULD BE AT ONCE WITHDRAWN FROM A RULER WHO EVEN UNDER STRICT CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINTS
WERE AT THIS TIME MOST DESIROUS THAT THE HOSPITALITY OF THEIR COUNTRY
SUCH WAS THE END WHICH CHARLES DISTINCTLY PROPOSED TO HIMSELF FROM MARCH SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE TO APRIL SIXTEEN FORTY THE HOUSES WERE NOT CONVOKED
HER POLITICAL AND THEOLOGICAL OPINIONS AS WELL AS HER COMPASSIONATE DISPOSITION LED HER TO DO EVERYTHING IN HER POWER FOR BURTON SHE PROCURED A BOAT WHICH TOOK HIM TO GRAVESEND WHERE HE GOT ON BOARD OF A SHIP
THEY ACCORDINGLY DOLED OUT SUPPLIES TO HIM VERY SPARINGLY
AND WHICH HAD DURING FOUR GENERATIONS BORNE PECULIAR ENMITY TO THE HOUSE OF STUART IT HAPPENED MOREOVER THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GRANT LARGE RELIEF TO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC AND TO THE QUAKER
TO MAKE CHARLES A MONARCH AS ABSOLUTE AS ANY ON THE CONTINENT
WAS SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE SHOULD NEVER HAVE REPROACHED HIM WITH THIS GREAT VICE
ASKED BY WHAT RIGHT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD BEEN PURGED OF ITS MOST RESPECTABLE MEMBERS AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS DEPRIVED OF ITS LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS AND TOLD HIS WEEPING HEARERS THAT HE WAS DEFENDING NOT ONLY HIS OWN CAUSE BUT THEIRS
ALL THE CLANS HOSTILE TO THE NAME OF CAMPBELL WERE SET IN MOTION JOHN MURRAY MARQUESS OF ATHOL
WAS DESIROUS TO MAKE HIS PUNISHMENT MORE SEVERE THAN THAT OF FELONS OR TRAITORS AND NOT MERELY TO PUT HIM TO DEATH BUT TO PUT HIM TO DEATH BY FRIGHTFUL TORMENTS HE WAS SENTENCED TO BE STRIPPED OF HIS CLERICAL HABIT TO BE PILLORIED IN PALACE YARD
HE WAS THE OSTENSIBLE HEAD OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND WAS THEREFORE HELD RESPONSIBLE EVEN FOR THOSE ACTS WHICH HE HAD STRONGLY BUT VAINLY OPPOSED IN COUNCIL HE WAS REGARDED BY THE PURITANS
FOR THESE THINGS HISTORY MUST HOLD THE KING HIMSELF CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE FROM THE TIME OF HIS THIRD PARLIAMENT HE WAS HIS OWN PRIME MINISTER
ONE DAY MARGUERITE WAS IN HER ROOM I ENTERED SHE WAS WRITING TO WHOM ARE YOU WRITING I ASKED TO PRUDENCE DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I AM WRITING
THAN THAT WHICH ONE HOLDS BETWEEN ONE'S HANDS THE MIND ADMITS NEITHER WORK NOR REMEMBRANCE NOTHING IN SHORT WHICH CAN DISTRACT IT FROM THE ONE THOUGHT IN WHICH IT IS CEASELESSLY ABSORBED
IF THAT WILL AMUSE YOU THE LEAST IN THE WORLD AFTER ALL NO SHE SAID LEAVING THE WINDOW AND GOING TO SIT DOWN ON THE SOFA AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WHY SHOULD WE SPEND MONEY ABROAD I COST YOU ENOUGH ALREADY HERE
WAS A WISH TO MAKE HER SEE THAT I WAS STRONGER THAN SHE HOW MANY WAYS DOES THE HEART TAKE HOW MANY REASONS DOES IT INVENT FOR ITSELF IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT WHAT IT WANTS
WHILE GAMBLING GAVE A NEW TURN TO THE FEVER WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE PREYED UPON MY HEART AND FIXED IT UPON A PASSION WHICH LAID HOLD ON ME IN SPITE OF MYSELF UNTIL THE HOUR STRUCK WHEN I MIGHT GO TO MY MISTRESS THEN
LIKE TWO CHILDREN IN THE DIM ALLEYS OF THE CHAMPS ELYSEES SHE WOULD COME IN TIRED TAKE A LIGHT SUPPER AND GO TO BED AFTER A LITTLE MUSIC OR READING WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN USED TO DO THE COUGH
IF MARGUERITE HAS NOT BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO YOU TWENTY TIMES IT IS BECAUSE SHE HAS AN EXCEPTIONAL NATURE IT IS NOT MY FAULT FOR NOT ADVISING HER TO FOR I COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE THE POOR GIRL STRIPPING HERSELF OF EVERYTHING
I GAZED AT HER SO FIXEDLY THAT MY EYES ATTRACTED HERS SHE LOOKED AT ME FOR A FEW SECONDS PUT UP HER OPERA GLASS TO SEE ME BETTER AND SEEMED TO THINK SHE RECOGNISED ME WITHOUT BEING QUITE SURE WHO I WAS
YOU MUST BE VERY RICH THEN WHY YOU DON'T KNOW THAT I SPEND SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH AND THAT I COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT YOU DON'T KNOW MY POOR FRIEND THAT I SHOULD RUIN YOU IN NO TIME
AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF TWO TEARS FELL UPON IT WHY WHAT A CHILD YOU ARE SHE SAID SITTING DOWN BY MY SIDE AGAIN YOU ARE CRYING WHAT IS THE MATTER
VERY MUCH KEPT MY DEAR FELLOW DON'T BE SHY SAY ANYTHING THAT COMES INTO YOUR HEAD YES YES I STAMMERED AND I FOLLOWED HIM SAYING TO MYSELF
THERE WE LISTENED TO THE CHEERFUL HARMONIES OF EVENING BOTH OF US THINKING OF THE COMING HOURS WHICH SHOULD LEAVE US TO ONE ANOTHER TILL THE DAWN OF DAY AT OTHER TIMES WE DID NOT GET UP ALL DAY WE DID NOT EVEN LET THE SUNLIGHT ENTER OUR ROOM
AND I WILL NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I AM LIVING WITH HIM IT IS FOLLY NO DOUBT BUT I LOVE HIM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO AND THEN NOW THAT HE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE ALWAYS WITH ME
PRUDENCE NOW CAME BUT RARELY BUT SHE OFTEN WROTE LETTERS WHICH I NEVER ASKED TO SEE THOUGH EVERY TIME THEY CAME THEY SEEMED TO PREOCCUPY MARGUERITE DEEPLY I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK
WHICH YOU TOLD ME OF IN THE EVENING NEXT DAY WHEN YOU WERE AT PARIS WAITING FOR YOUR FATHER AND HE DID NOT RETURN
HE CALLS HER HIS DAUGHTER LOOKS AFTER HER LIKE A CHILD AND IS ALWAYS IN THE WAY I AM SURE AT THIS VERY MOMENT ONE OF HIS SERVANTS IS PROWLING ABOUT IN THE STREET TO SEE WHO COMES OUT AND ESPECIALLY WHO GOES IN AH
THAT NOW THAT YOU HAVE LET ME COME TO SEE YOU NOW THAT I KNOW YOU NOW THAT I KNOW ALL THAT IS STRANGE IN YOU YOU HAVE BECOME A NECESSITY OF MY LIFE AND YOU WILL DRIVE ME MAD
HIDDEN UNDER THE APPARENT CALM OF THE INVALID BUT ARMAND ON THE CONTRARY SEEMED TO DELIGHT IN SPEAKING OF HER NOT AS FORMERLY WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES BUT WITH A SWEET SMILE WHICH REASSURED ME AS TO THE STATE OF HIS MIND
THIS IS WHAT THE LETTER CONTAINED I SHALL LIKE WRITING IT OVER AGAIN SO AS TO GIVE MYSELF ANOTHER PROOF OF MY OWN JUSTIFICATION
IMAGINE THAT MARGUERITE IS MARRIED
SAID NANINE AS SHE SAW US ENTER SHE HAS GONE AGAIN ASKED MARGUERITE YES MADAME IN THE CARRIAGE SHE SAID IT WAS ARRANGED QUITE RIGHT SAID MARGUERITE SHARPLY
WELL SAID MARGUERITE WELL I HAVE SEEN THE DUKE WHAT DID HE SAY THAT HE WOULD GLADLY FORGIVE YOU IN REGARD TO THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE
HASN'T SHE ANY LOVERS I ASKED I NEVER SEE ANY ONE REMAIN AFTER I LEAVE I DON'T SAY NO ONE EVER COMES WHEN I AM GONE OFTEN IN THE EVENING I MEET THERE A CERTAIN COMTE DE N
FAR THAT MY MISTRESS NOW BELONGED TO ME MORE COMPLETELY AND MY DREAM WAS AT LENGTH REALIZED MARGUERITE COULD NOT BE WITHOUT ME NOT CARING WHAT THE RESULT MIGHT BE SHE PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED OUR LIAISON
ALWAYS REPEATING THAT I WAS QUITE WELL AND THAT I WAS NOT IN NEED OF MONEY TWO THINGS WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD CONSOLE MY FATHER FOR MY DELAY IN PAYING HIM MY ANNUAL VISIT JUST THEN ONE FINE DAY IN SUMMER
AS PRUDENCE HAD TOLD US IT WAS THE REAL COUNTRY AND I MUST ADD IT WAS A REAL LUNCH IT IS NOT ONLY OUT OF GRATITUDE FOR THE HAPPINESS I OWE IT
I WROTE TO PRUDENCE TO SAY THAT I ACCEPTED THE PROPOSITION OF THE COMTE DE N AND THAT SHE WAS TO TELL HIM THAT I WOULD SUP WITH HER AND HIM I SEALED THE LETTER AND WITHOUT TELLING HIM WHAT IT CONTAINED ASKED YOUR FATHER TO HAVE IT FORWARDED TO ITS ADDRESS ON REACHING PARIS HE INQUIRED OF ME WHAT IT CONTAINED
THEN SHE SOMETIMES CAME TO DINE WITH ME ONE MORNING I DID NOT GO TILL EIGHT AND THERE CAME A DAY WHEN I DID NOT GO TILL TWELVE BUT SOONER THAN THE MORAL METAMORPHOSIS A PHYSICAL METAMORPHOSIS CAME ABOUT IN MARGUERITE
LOVE ME A LITTLE I SAID MY HEART BEATING SO THAT I COULD HARDLY SPEAK
WHEN YOU ARE STRONG AGAIN YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE LIFE YOU ARE LEADING IF YOU CHOOSE BUT I AM SURE YOU WILL COME TO PREFER A QUIET LIFE WHICH WILL MAKE YOU HAPPIER AND KEEP YOUR BEAUTY UNSPOILED YOU THINK LIKE THAT TO NIGHT BECAUSE THE WINE HAS MADE YOU SAD
I PASSED WHOLE DAYS AT THE FEET OF MY MISTRESS WE OPENED THE WINDOWS UPON THE GARDEN AND AS WE WATCHED THE SUMMER RIPENING IN ITS FLOWERS
WHOM ARE YOU BOWING TO I ASKED MARGUERITE GAUTIER HE SAID SHE SEEMS MUCH CHANGED FOR I DID NOT RECOGNISE HER I SAID WITH AN EMOTION THAT YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND SHE HAS BEEN ILL THE POOR GIRL WON'T LAST LONG I REMEMBER THE WORDS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SPOKEN TO ME YESTERDAY
THAT IF I DRIVE THE THOUGHT OF YOU OUT OF MY MIND IT ALWAYS COMES BACK THAT WHEN I MET YOU TO DAY AFTER NOT HAVING SEEN YOU FOR TWO YEARS YOU MADE A DEEPER IMPRESSION ON MY HEART AND MIND THAN EVER
AS NOT TO KNOW THAT I WAS LIVING THEM I BEGAN BY BORROWING FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS ON MY LITTLE CAPITAL AND WITH THIS I TOOK TO GAMBLING SINCE GAMBLING HOUSES WERE DESTROYED GAMBLING GOES ON EVERYWHERE
AND WHAT DOES THIS DEVOTION COME FROM THE IRRESISTIBLE SYMPATHY WHICH I HAVE FOR YOU SO YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH ME SAY IT STRAIGHT OUT IT IS MUCH MORE SIMPLE IT IS POSSIBLE
MARGUERITE WAS AWAKENED BY THE SUNLIGHT POURING INTO HER ROOM AND JUMPING OUT OF BED ASKED ME IF I WOULD TAKE HER INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE WHOLE DAY
GOOD BYE THEN YOU SEND ME AWAY NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD WHY ARE YOU SO UNKIND TO ME HOW HAVE I BEEN UNKIND TO YOU IN TELLING ME THAT SOME ONE WAS WAITING FOR YOU
I SHOWED HIM THE PAWN TICKETS THE RECEIPTS OF THE PEOPLE TO WHOM I HAD SOLD WHAT I COULD NOT PAWN
ENOUGH JOKING I SAID TO PRUDENCE TELL ME EXACTLY HOW MUCH MARGUERITE IS IN NEED OF I HAVE TOLD YOU THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS AND WHEN DOES SHE REQUIRE THIS SUM
AND THAT HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE THAT LET MARGUERITE LEAVE THE YOUNG MAN HE SAID TO ME AND AS IN THE PAST I WILL GIVE HER ALL THAT SHE REQUIRES IF NOT LET HER ASK NOTHING MORE FROM ME
AT THE DOOR PRUDENCE ASKED US TO COME UP AND SEE HER SHOWROOMS WHICH WE HAD NEVER SEEN AND OF WHICH SHE SEEMED VERY PROUD YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EAGERLY I ACCEPTED IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF I WAS COMING NEARER AND NEARER TO MARGUERITE
WHO HAD REMEMBERED MY FACE FOR A MOMENT DID NOT REMEMBER MY NAME I WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED TO MY DISADVANTAGE THAN THUS FORGOTTEN I KNEW SAID GASTON THAT SHE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEE US
SHE LOVES AND SHE TOO HAS MADE THIS LOVE THE DREAM OF HER LIFE
THE BREEZE THE SHINING SOLITUDE OF FIELDS OR WOODS HOWEVER MUCH ONE LOVES A WOMAN WHATEVER CONFIDENCE ONE MAY HAVE IN HER WHATEVER CERTAINTY HER PAST MAY OFFER US AS TO HER FUTURE ONE IS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS JEALOUS
BUT HE LACKS REASONING POWER THE MATHEMATICS OF HIS IDEAS ARE VERY POOR I LOOKED CLOSELY AT ROULETABILLE AND COULD NOT HELP SMILING ON HEARING THIS BOY OF EIGHTEEN TALKING OF A MAN WHO HAD PROVED TO THE WORLD THAT HE WAS THE FINEST POLICE SLEUTH IN EUROPE YOU SMILE
KNOWN TO HIM ALONE HE KNOWS THE CHATEAU HE SAID TO ME HE KNOWS IT WELL
WHO DESIRES TO SPEAK WITH HIM I REALLY DON'T KNOW MONSIEUR ROULETABILLE REPLIED FRED SHAKING HANDS WITH MY FRIEND WHOM HE HAD SEVERAL TIMES MET IN THE COURSE OF HIS DIFFICULT INVESTIGATIONS I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM
I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET UP BUT THREE TIMES
BUT LET HIM ONLY GIVE ME THE CHANCE LET ME FIND OUT WHETHER HE IS REALLY A CREATURE OF FLESH AND BLOOD LET ME SEE HIS DEAD BODY SINCE IT CANNOT BE TAKEN ALIVE
HE ALSO APPEARED TO BE DEEPLY CONCERNED FROM HIS POCKET BOOK HE TOOK A PIECE OF WHITE PAPER AS I HAD SEEN HIM DO BEFORE AND WITH HIS SCISSORS CUT OUT THE SHAPE OF THE NEAT BOOTMARKS THAT WERE ON THE GROUND
HE LED ME THROUGH THE GALLERY WE REACHED THE RIGHT GALLERY AND CAME TO THE LANDING PLACE WHICH WE CROSSED WE THEN CONTINUED OUR WAY IN THE GALLERY OF THE LEFT WING
THE SCEPTICAL TONE OF HIS CONVERSATION WAS THAT OF A MAN WHO HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY EXPERIENCE HIS STRANGE PROFESSION HAD BROUGHT HIM INTO CONTACT WITH SO MANY CRIMES AND VILLANIES THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE IF HIS NATURE HAD NOT BEEN A LITTLE HARDENED
LIKE YOU I THINK THAT HE FOUND IT SOMEWHERE NEAR MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC BUT IF AS YOU SUPPOSE THE MURDERER WAS IN THE YELLOW ROOM FOR FIVE OR EVEN SIX HOURS AND THE CRIME WAS NOT COMMITTED UNTIL TOWARDS MIDNIGHT
THAT THE MAN ENTERED BY THE WINDOW AT THE TIME YOU SAY I ADMIT I SAID BUT WHY DID HE SHUT THE WINDOW IT WAS AN ACT WHICH WOULD NECESSARILY DRAW THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO HAD LEFT IT OPEN IT MAY BE THE WINDOW WAS NOT SHUT AT ONCE REPLIED THE YOUNG REPORTER
DURING THE FIVE O'CLOCK WALK OF THE PROFESSOR AND HIS DAUGHTER THE FACT OF THE PRESENCE OF THE CHAMBERMAID WHO HAD COME TO CLEAN UP THE YELLOW ROOM IN THE LABORATORY WHEN MONSIEUR STANGERSON AND HIS DAUGHTER RETURNED FROM THEIR WALK AT HALF PAST ONE
BEFORE ROULETABILLE HAD GIVEN PROOF OF HIS UNIQUE TALENT LARSAN WAS REPUTED AS THE MOST SKILFUL UNRAVELLER OF THE MOST MYSTERIOUS AND COMPLICATED CRIMES HIS REPUTATION WAS WORLD WIDE
AS WELL AS I COULD MAKE OUT WERE NOT FAR FROM THOSE HELD BY FREDERIC LARZAN THE AMERICAN ALSO THOUGHT THAT ROBERT DARZAC HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MATTER
THAT HE ADMIRED THE PRUDENT DOUBT WITH WHICH CERTAIN PEOPLE APPROACHED THE MOST SIMPLE PROBLEMS RISKING NOTHING BY SAYING THAT IS SO OR THAT IS NOT SO
AND THEN DADDY JACQUES LEAVE THE PAVILION GRAVEL HAS BEEN SPREAD NEARLY VERY NEARLY UP TO THE WINDOWS OF THE PAVILION THE FOOTPRINTS OF A MAN PARALLEL WITH THE WALL MARKS WHICH WE WILL EXAMINE PRESENTLY AND WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SEEN
MY POOR ROBERT ROULETABILLE WHISPERED IN MY EAR
THE SOBS HAD CEASED IF WE CAN'T HEAR WE MAY AT LEAST TRY TO SEE SAID ROULETABILLE AND MAKING A SIGN TO ME TO DEADEN THE SOUND OF MY STEPS
NO NO THERE WAS BUT ONE MAN THERE THE MURDERER ON FOOT BRAVO BRAVO CRIED FRED AGAIN AND COMING SUDDENLY TOWARDS US AND PLANTING HIMSELF IN FRONT OF MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC HE SAID TO HIM
IT WAS THEN SIX O'CLOCK BY HIS WATCH RISING HE MADE A SIGN TO ME TO FOLLOW HIM AND WITHOUT IN THE LEAST TYING TO CONCEAL HIS MOVEMENTS OR THE SOUND OF HIS FOOTSTEPS
AND APPLIED IT TO A VERY CLEAR FOOTMARK BEHIND THE THICKET AHA HE SAID RISING I THOUGHT HE WAS NOW GOING TO TRACE BACK THE TRACK OF THE MURDERER'S FOOTMARKS TO THE VESTIBULE WINDOW BUT HE LED US INSTEAD FAR TO THE LEFT SAYING THAT IT WAS USELESS FERRETING IN THE MUD
LARSAN TURNED HIS HEAD AT THE SOUND OF A VEHICLE WHICH HAD COME FROM THE CHATEAU AND REACHED THE GATE BEHIND HIM
AND LAUGHING A LITTLE IN A SLIGHTLY BANTERING TONE HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
THE DOOR OF THE BOUDOIR WAS OPEN THE TERRIFIED FACES OF THE TWO NURSES CRANED TOWARDS US MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON INQUIRED THE MEANING OF ALL THE DISTURBANCE THAT SHE WAS NOT IN HER OWN ROOM WAS QUITE EASILY EXPLAINED QUITE EASILY
WE SAW NO MORE OF DADDY MATHIEU THAT DAY AND ABSOLUTE SILENCE REIGNED IN THE INN WHEN WE LEFT IT AFTER PLACING FIVE FRANCS ON THE TABLE IN PAYMENT FOR OUR FEAST
THAT ESCAPED ME BUT MY MIND WAS TURNED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF FALSE INDICATIONS OF HIS TRACK WHICH THE MURDERER LEFT AND BY THE MEASURE OF THE BLACK FOOT MARKS CORRESPONDING WITH THAT OF DADDY JACQUES'S BOOTS
I TURNED MY EYES AGAIN ON ROULETABILLE AH MONSIEUR FRED
WE SHALL SEE THAT LATER HE REPLIED FOR THE PRESENT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT THE LANDLORD SAID ABOUT THE MAN THE LANDLORD HATES HIM I DIDN'T TAKE YOU TO BREAKFAST AT THE DONJON INN FOR THE SAKE OF THE GREEN MAN
FRED PASSED THE CANE TO ROULETABILLE IT WAS A LARGE YELLOW BAMBOO WITH A CRUTCH HANDLE AND ORNAMENTED WITH A GOLD RING
AND YET SHE KEEPS THE SECRET WHEN I KNOW WHO I WILL SPEAK TO HIM TO HIM SHE LOOKED AT US NOW WITH A FAR AWAY LOOK IN HER EYES AS IF WE WERE NOT IN THE CHAMBER MONSIEUR STANGERSON BROKE THE SILENCE
AN HOUR OR SO AGO THERE WAS A LADDER CLOSE BY YOUR WINDOW WHAT LADDER I DID NOT SEE ANY LADDER GOOD NIGHT
SHE HAD A FANCY NOT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT IN HER CHAMBER BUT IN THE BOUDOIR WITH HER NURSES
IF WE GO ON AT THIS RATE WE'LL BOTH COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION HAVE YOU ANY IDEA AS TO HOW THE MURDERER GOT AWAY FROM THE YELLOW ROOM YES SAID MY YOUNG FRIEND I HAVE AN IDEA
THREE WINDOWS LOOKED OUT ON TO THE ROAD A COLOURED ADVERTISEMENT LAUDED THE MANY MERITS OF A NEW VERMOUTH ON THE MANTELPIECE WAS ARRAYED THE INNKEEPER'S COLLECTION OF FIGURED EARTHENWARE POTS AND STONE JUGS
THE CAT AT HER FEET YOU'VE BEEN ILL MOTHER ANGENOUX IS THAT WHY WE HAVE NOT SEEN YOU FOR THE LAST WEEK ASKED THE GREEN MAN
BY THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE MAN WITH THE BEARD AT ONE OF THE MOST TRAGIC MOMENTS OF THIS CASE I THEN LEARNED THAT THE YOUTH WAS ONE OF LARSAN'S ASSISTANTS AND HAD BEEN CHARGED BY HIM TO WATCH THE GOING AND COMING OF TRAVELLERS AT THE STATION OF EPINAY SUR ORGE
THE MATHEMATICAL IDEA I HAVE OF THE MURDERER GIVES RESULTS SO FRIGHTFUL
PASSING PROFESSOR STANGERSON'S APARTMENT AT THE FAR END OF THE GALLERY BEFORE COMING TO THE DONJON IS THE ROOM OCCUPIED BY ARTHUR RANCE WE KNEW THAT
BECAUSE FREDERIC LARSAN HAS NOT QUITTED THE BORDERS OF IT SINCE THIS MORNING THERE MUST BE SOME IMPORTANT MARKS THERE A FEW MINUTES LATER WE REACHED THE LAKE IT WAS A LITTLE SHEET OF MARSHY WATER SURROUNDED BY REEDS
BUT YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION WE WERE PASSING BY THE THICKET OF WHICH THE YOUNG REPORTER HAD SPOKEN TO US A MINUTE BEFORE I ENTERED IT AND POINTED OUT EVIDENT TRACES OF A MAN WHO HAD BEEN HIDDEN THERE
I SAW HER AND THAT HELPED TO RELIEVE MY CHAOTIC STATE OF MIND I BREATHED HER I INHALED THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK WHOM I SHOULD NEVER SEE AGAIN
THIS GALLERY HIGH AND WIDE EXTENDED ALONG THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BUILDING AND WAS LIT FROM THE FRONT OF THE CHATEAU FACING THE NORTH THE ROOMS THE WINDOWS OF WHICH LOOKED TO THE SOUTH OPENED OUT OF THE GALLERY
AND SAID HE WAS SURE OF THE CHAMBERMAID'S FIDELITY AND THAT SHE WAS A THOROUGHLY HONEST AND DEVOTED SERVANT BESIDES HE ADDED AT FIVE O'CLOCK MONSIEUR STANGERSON WENT INTO THE ROOM TO FETCH HIS DAUGHTER'S HAT THERE IS THAT ALSO SAID ROULETABILLE
AND FOR A MONTH PAST HE HASN'T BEEN HERE THE DONJON INN HAS NEVER EXISTED FOR HIM HE HASN'T HAD TIME
THE GREEN MAN GROWLED THE INNKEEPER DON'T YOU KNOW HIM THEN ALL THE BETTER FOR YOU HE IS NOT AN ACQUAINTANCE TO MAKE WELL HE IS MONSIEUR STANGERSON'S FOREST KEEPER
MY EYES FOLLOWED HIS GAZE THEY WERE FIXED ON MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC WHO WAS LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AT THE IMPRESSION LEFT BY HIS FEET SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE ELEGANT FOOTMARKS THERE WAS NOT A PARTICLE OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM WE THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO FAINT
AND FREDERIC LARSAN HIMSELF IS OBLIGED TO TURN AWAY TO HIDE HIS EMOTION FOR MYSELF I AM ABLE NEITHER TO THINK OR FEEL I FELT AN INFINITE CONTEMPT FOR MYSELF
FIBRE OF ALL SORTS WADDED STUFF STONEHENGE DRAPED IT'S REALLY A DELIGHTFUL IDEA SAID THE FATHER OF THE FAMILY ENJOYING IT IT'S QUITE A POSSIBLE ONE SAID SIR RICHMOND OR THEY MAY HAVE USED WICKER
NO IT IS SIMPLY THAT I WAS HOPELESSLY DISAPPOINTED WITH EVERYTHING THAT A GOOD WOMAN AND A DECENT MARRIAGE HAD TO GIVE ME PURE DISAPPOINTMENT AND VEXATION THE ANTI CLIMAX TO AN IMMENSE EXPECTATION BUILT UP THROUGHOUT AN IMAGINATIVE BOYHOOD AND YOUTH AND EARLY MANHOOD
WITH THE UNSPOKEN ADDITION OF YOU TRY HER FOR A BIT MISS GRAMMONT STOOD UP EVERYBODY STOOD UP WE CAN GO FIRST TO LOOK FOR SHOPS SHE SAID THERE'S THOSE THINGS YOU WANT TO BUY BELINDA A FOUNTAIN PEN AND THE LITTLE BOOKS
OR SHE HAS MET WITH COWARDICE OR CRUELTY OR TREACHERY WHERE SHE DIDN'T EXPECT IT SHE HAS BEEN SHOCKED OUT OF THE FIRST CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH SHE HAS CEASED TO TAKE THE WORLD FOR GRANTED IT HASN'T BROKEN HER BUT IT HAS MATURED HER
SAID SIR RICHMOND WELL
SAID PAPA WINNIE GO AND TELL PRICE HE'S GONE BACK TO THE CAR
AND HOW AMAZED I WAS AT THE DISCOVERY I WAS A BOY OF TWELVE OR THIRTEEN MY PEOPLE TOOK ME ONE SUMMER TO DYMCHURCH IN ROMNEY MARSH IN THOSE DAYS BEFORE THE AUTOMOBILE HAD MADE THE MARSH ACCESSIBLE TO THE HYTHE AND FOLKESTONE CROWDS
AND NO ONE TO SLAP THEM OR TELL THEM NOT TO AFTER ALL THEY PROBABLY ONLY THOUGHT OF DEATH NOW AND THEN AND THEY NEVER THOUGHT OF FUEL THEY SUPPOSED THERE WAS NO END TO THAT SO THEY USED UP THEIR WOODS AND KEPT GOATS TO NIBBLE AND KILL THE NEW UNDERGROWTH DID THESE PEOPLE HAVE GOATS
A FAINT BUT EXCESSIVELY IRRITATING GLEAM OF AMUSEMENT OH
WHAT CAN ONE CALL THEM LOVE ADVENTURES HOW MANY YOU ASK I DON'T KNOW NEVER HAVE I BEEN A WHOLE HEARTED LOVER NEVER HAVE I BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE LOVE ALONE NEVER HAS LOVE LEFT ME ALONE AND AS I AM MADE SAID SIR RICHMOND WITH SUDDEN INSISTENCE
THIS ARTIST'S LARK AS THEY DID IN STONEHENGE I CERTAINLY DO NOT REMEMBER THAT I EVER WORSHIPPED HERE SHE SAID
THOUGH THEY WRESTLED MIGHTILY WITH THE PROBLEM NEITHER SIR RICHMOND NOR THE DOCTOR COULD THROW A GLEAM OF LIGHT UPON THE RIDDLE WHY THE DITCH WAS INSIDE AND NOT OUTSIDE THE GREAT WALL AND WHAT WAS OUR MIND LIKE IN THOSE DAYS SAID SIR RICHMOND
HE WOULD NOT RISE TO ANY CONVERSATIONAL BAIT THAT THE DOCTOR COULD DEVISE THE DOCTOR FOUND THIS THE MORE REGRETTABLE BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS MUCH TO BE WORKED UPON IN THIS MARTIN LEEDS AFFAIR HE WAS INCLINED TO THINK THAT SHE AND SIR RICHMOND WERE UNDULY OBSESSED BY THE IDEA THAT THEY HAD TO STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE CHILD
SHE KEEPS ON LOOKING AT IT SAID THE SMALL BOY IT ISUNT ANYTHING
AFTER TWENTY FOUR EVENTFUL HOURS OUR TWO STUDENTS OF HUMAN MOTIVES FOUND THEMSELVES TOGETHER AGAIN BY THE FIREPLACE IN THE OLD GEORGE SMOKING ROOM THEY HAD RESUMED THEIR OVERNIGHT CONVERSATION IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE TENSION
GROTESQUELY HAPPEN HE SAID SHE KNOWS NOTHING OF MARTIN LEEDS YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT AND THEN HE ADDED IF SHE AND YOU FALL IN LOVE
FROM THE PSYCHOLOGIST OF A NEW AGE I FIND THIS AMAZING ARE MEN AND WOMEN TO GO ON FOR EVER SEPARATED BY THIS POSSIBILITY INTO TWO HARDLY COMMUNICATING AND YET INTERPENETRATING WORLDS
AND REPLACEABLE STRUCTURES INDEED BOTH THESE TWO PEOPLE FOUND THEMSELVES THINKING IN THIS FASHION WITH AN UNWONTED COURAGE AND FREEDOM BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE HAD BEEN DISPOSED TO THINK IN THIS FASHION BEFORE
POOR AT THE BEST LOVE WORK ALL IT HAD BEEN SPLENDID WORK SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND WAS NOT SURE THAT SIR RICHMOND HEARD
AT THE FIFTH SIR RICHMOND WAS SUDDENLY CONCLUSIVE IT'S NO USE HE SAID I CAN'T FIDDLE ABOUT ANY MORE WITH MY MOTIVES TO DAY AN AWKWARD SILENCE FOLLOWED ON REFLECTION SIR RICHMOND SEEMED TO REALIZE THAT THIS SENTENCE NEEDED SOME APOLOGY I ADMIT
AND AT PRESENT THE WORLD IS NOT PREPARED TO TOLERATE FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANIONSHIP WITH THAT ACCOMPANIMENT THAT IS THE CORE OF THIS SITUATION A PAUSE FELL BETWEEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN
FAR BETTER TO CALL IT THE GODDESS COMPLEX THE CONNEXION IS NOT PERHAPS IMMEDIATELY VISIBLE SAID THE DOCTOR THERE WAS NO CONNEXION SAID SIR RICHMOND
AS A CRISIS IN WHICH THEY WERE CALLED UPON TO DO SOMETHING THEY DID NOT YET CLEARLY KNOW WHAT INTO THIS TOPIC THEY PEERED AS INTO SOME DEEP POOL SIDE BY SIDE AND IN IT THEY SAW EACH OTHER REFLECTED
MORE THAN THAT MORE THAN THAT WE HAVE LEADING IDEAS ASSOCIATIONS POSSESSIONS LIABILITIES WE BUILD OURSELVES A PRISON OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT KEEPS US FROM COMPLETE DISPERSAL EXACTLY SAID THE DOCTOR AND THERE IS ALSO SOMETHING
IS THIS IDEA OF A SORT OF WOMAN GODDESS WHO WAS VERY LOVELY AND KIND AND POWERFUL AND WONDERFUL THAT RULED MY SECRET IMAGINATIONS AS A BOY BUT IT WAS VERY MUCH IN MY MIND AS I GREW UP THE MOTHER COMPLEX
MOTHER OF I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY AMERICAN GLOUCESTERS BATH WE'LL GET IN SOMEHOW AND THEN AS AN ANGLO AMERICAN SHOWMAN I SHALL BE TEMPTED TO RUN YOU NORTHWARD A LITTLE WAY PAST TEWKESBURY
THAT I THINK IS WHY HISTORY HAS BECOME REAL TO HER WHICH SO ATTRACTS YOU IN HER HISTORY FOR HER HAS CEASED TO BE A FABRIC OF PICTURESQUE INCIDENTS IT IS THE STUDY OF A TRAGIC STRUGGLE THAT STILL GOES ON
HE DISCOVERED HIS DAUGHTER DISPLAYING WHAT HE CONSIDERED AN IMPROPER FAMILIARITY WITH SOCIALIST IDEAS
I THINK SAID THE DOCTOR AND PAUSED I SHALL LEAVE THIS AVEBURY EXPEDITION TO YOU WE CAN BE BACK IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON SAID SIR RICHMOND TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE OF SEEING THE CATHEDRAL THE CHAPTER HOUSE HERE IS NOT ONE TO MISS AND THEN I SUPPOSE WE SHALL GO ON AS YOU PLEASE SAID SIR RICHMOND INSINCERELY
DESPAIR LIKE THE DESPAIR OF CHILDREN THAT CAN WEEP ITSELF TO SLEEP IT'S OVER WAS IT BATTLE AND MASSACRE THAT ENDED THAT LONG AFTERNOON HERE OR DID THE WOODS CATCH FIRE SOME EXCEPTIONALLY DRY SUMMER LEAVING BLACK HILLS AND FAMINE
AND FOUND IT WAS A HUNDRED AND ONE HE TELEPHONED HASTILY FOR DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIS ARRIVAL TOOK A HOT BATH AND GOT INTO BED HE WAS ALREADY THOROUGHLY ILL WHEN THE DOCTOR ARRIVED
THAT GIRL ON THE DYMCHURCH BEACH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST LINKS BUT SHE CEASED VERY SPEEDILY TO BE REAL
BUT EVEN YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT THE SHOW WAS V V SAID THE LADY IN GREY
I GRANT YOU WE DISCOVER WE DIFFER UPON A QUESTION OF TASTE AND CONVENIENCE BUT BEFORE I SUGGESTED THIS TRIP I HAD INTENDED TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH MY OLD FRIEND SIR KENELM LATTER AT BOURNEMOUTH NOTHING SIMPLER THAN TO GO TO HIM NOW
WELL SHE IMPRESSED ME AS HAVING THE AIR OF A GIRL WHO HAS HAD TO SOLVE MANY PROBLEMS FOR WHICH THE NORMAL MOTHER PROVIDES READY MADE SOLUTIONS THAT IS HOW I INFERRED THAT THERE WAS NO MOTHER I DON'T THINK THERE HAS BEEN ANY STEPMOTHER
THAT WOULD GIVE THIS LARGE INDUSTRIOUS APARTMENT A LITTLE MORE OF THE RESTFULNESS AND COMFORT OF A SICK ROOM I MUST GET IN A NIGHT NURSE AT ONCE HE SAID WE MUST FIND A SMALL TABLE SOMEWHERE TO PUT NEAR THE BED
SHE SWAM STRAIGHT OUT FOR A LONG WAY AS IT SEEMED TO ME AND PRESENTLY CAME IN AND PASSED ME AGAIN ON HER WAY BACK TO HER TENT LIGHT AND SWIFT AND SURE THE VERY PRINTS OF HER FEET ON THE SAND WERE BEAUTIFUL
STROLLED UP THE DOWN TO THE NORTHWARD TO GET A GENERAL VIEW OF THE VILLAGE HAD TEA AND SMOKED ROUND THE WALLS AGAIN IN THE WARM APRIL SUNSET THE MATTER OF THEIR CONVERSATION REMAINED PREHISTORIC
I'VE NO DOUBT OF IT SAID MISS SEYFFERT AND ADDED AMAZINGLY I'M OUT FOR BIRTH CONTROL ALL THE TIME A BRIEF BUT ACTIVE PAUSE ENSUED
A BROAD AND ORIGINAL THINKER AS YOU ARE THOUGHT IS ONE MATTER RASH INCONSIDERATE ACTION QUITE ANOTHER AND ABOVE ALL IF I SPEND ANOTHER DAY IN OR NEAR THE COMPANY OF MISS
MAKING THEM MATTER AS FORMERLY THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER THAT IDEA OF THE BRIGHT LITTLE PRIVATE LIFE HAS TO GO BY THE BOARD I SUPPOSE IT HAS SHE SAID MEDITATIVELY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN THINKING OVER SOME SUCH QUESTION BEFORE
IN THE COMPOSITION OF SO SURE AND GALLANT A PERSONALITY MARTINEAU WAS VERY FINE MINDED IN MANY RESPECTS BUT HE WAS AN OLD MAID AND LIKE ALL OLD MAIDS HE SAW MAN AND WOMAN IN EVERY ENCOUNTER
HER MANNER WITH MISS SEYFFERT AN EXCELLENT MANNER FOR MISS SEYFFERT BY THE BYE ISN'T THE SORT OF MANNER ANYONE ACQUIRES IN A DAY OR FOR ONE PERSON ONLY SHE IS A VERY SURE AND COMMANDING YOUNG WOMAN SIR RICHMOND NODDED
THAT ONLY IS MEET LOW SINKS THE THRESHOLD LEVELLED WITH THE GROUND THE MAN LEAPS IN TO LIBERTY HE'S BOUND THE REST GO TALKING WALKING PICKING ROUND NINETEEN
BUT NOW THE SPIRIT AND I ARE ONE IN THIS MY HUNGER NOW IS AFTER RIGHTEOUSNESS MY SPIRIT HOPES IN GOD TO SET ME FREE FROM THE LOW SELF LOATHED OF THE HIGHER ME GREAT ELDER BROTHER OF MY SECOND BIRTH
BUT IN THE MIDST ALONE I GLADNESS AM AND LOVE
THAT LOOK NOT FOREGONE FITNESS THOU DOST HEED FOR DUTY ABSOLUTE HOW BE FITTER THAN NOW OR LEARN BY SHUNNING LORD I COME HELP THOU
SUBMISS AND READY TO THE MAKING WILL ATHIRST AND EMPTY FOR GOD'S BREATH TO FILL
THOU DOST DEMAND OUR LOVE HOLY LORD CHRIST AND BATEST NOTHING OF THY MODESTY
O LORD WHEN I DO THINK OF MY DEPARTED I THINK OF THEE WHO ART THE DEATH OF PARTING OF HIM WHO CRYING FATHER BREATHED HIS LAST THEN RADIANT FROM THE SEPULCHRE UPSTARTED
AND IN THE PERFECT TIME O PERFECT GOD WHEN WE ARE IN OUR HOME OUR NATAL HOME WHEN JOY SHALL CARRY EVERY SACRED LOAD AND FROM ITS LIFE AND PEACE NO HEART SHALL ROAM
BACK STRAIGHTWAY INTO THIRSTFUL DREAMING SINKS SO TURNS MY WILL TO THEE FOR THEE STILL LONGS STILL PINES TWENTY FOUR THE MORTAL MAN ALL CAREFUL WISE AND TROUBLED
THEY WILL NOT THEREFORE CANNOT DO NOT KNOW HIM NOTHING THEY COULD KNOW COULD BE GOD IN SOOTH UNTO THE TRUE ALONE EXISTS THE TRUTH THEY SAY WELL SAYING NATURE DOTH NOT SHOW HIM TRULY SHE SHOWS NOT WHAT SHE CANNOT SHOW
AND SOMETHING DEEPER THAT WILL NOT BE EXPRESSED SAVE AS THE SPIRIT THINKING IN THE SPIRIT'S BROOD

I SCENT THY SPRING I FEEL THE ETERNAL AIR WARM SOFT AND DEWY FILLED WITH FLOWERY EYES AND GENTLE MURMURING MOTIONS EVERYWHERE OF LIFE IN HEART AND TREE AND BROOK AND MOSS THY BREATH WAKES BEAUTY LOVE AND BLISS AND PRAYER
ALAS THE MOMENT I TURN TO MY HEART FEELING RUNS OUT OF DOORS OR STANDS APART BUT SUCH AS I AM LORD TAKE ME AS THOU ART
WHICH DARK HOURS TEEM OF OTHER SORT THAN THOSE THAT HAUNT THE DAY HINTING AT PRECIOUS THINGS AGES AWAY IN THE LONG TALE OF US GOD TO HIMSELF DOTH SAY SEVEN

THAT THOU ART NEARER NOW THAN WHEN EYE SEEN ON EARTH
ITSELF HIGH BORN ITS BEING DERIVED AND DRAWN FROM THE ETERNAL SELF EXISTENT FIRE THEN MAZED WITH JOY OF ITS OWN HEAVENLY BREED EXULTANT HUMBLE FALLS BEFORE ITS AWFUL SIRE
LO LORD THOU KNOW'ST I WOULD NOT ANYTHING THAT IN THE HEART OF GOD HOLDS NOT ITS ROOT NOR FALSELY DEEM THERE IS ANY LIFE AT ALL THAT DOTH IN HIM NOR SLEEP NOR SHINE NOR SING

THERE ARE WHO COME TO ME AND WRITE AND SEND WHOM I WOULD LOVE GIVING GOOD THINGS TO ALL BUT FRIEND THAT NAME I CANNOT ON THEM SPEND TIS FROM THE CENTRE OF SELF LOVE THEY CALL FOR CHERISHING
ALL UNAWARE OF LIGHT COME THROUGH THE DUSK I YET SHOULD FEEL THE SPLIT OF EACH SHELLY FOLD SHOULD FEEL THE GROWING OF MY PRISONED HEART AND DULLY DREAM OF BEING SLOW UNROLLED AND IN SOME OTHER VAGUENESS TAKING PART
WHEN I AM VERY WEARY WITH HARD THOUGHT AND YET THE QUESTION BURNS AND IS NOT QUENCHED MY HEART GROWS COOL WHEN TO REMEMBRANCE WROUGHT THAT THOU WHO KNOW'ST THE LIGHT BORN ANSWER SOUGHT
BUT LIKE A VIRTUOUS MEDICINE SELF DIFFUSED THROUGH ALL MEN'S HEARTS THY LOVE SHALL SINK AND FLOAT TILL EVERY FEELING FALSE AND THOUGHT UNWISE SELFISH AND SEEKING SHALL STERNLY DISUSED WITHER AND DIE AND SHRIVEL UP TO NOUGHT
THOU KNOW'ST HOW VERY HARD IT IS TO BE HOW HARD TO ROUSE FAINT WILL NOT YET REVIVING TO DO THE PURE THING TRUSTING ALL TO THEE TO HOLD THOU ART THERE FOR ALL NO FACE WE SEE
THY GREAT DELIVERANCE IS A GREATER THING THAN PUREST IMAGINATION CAN FOREGRASP A THING BEYOND ALL CONSCIOUS HUNGERING BEYOND ALL HOPE THAT MAKES THE POET SING IT TAKES THE CLINGING WORLD UNDOES ITS CLASP

TIS BUT AS MEN DRAW NIGH TO THEE MY LORD THEY CAN DRAW NIGH EACH OTHER AND NOT HURT WHO WITH THE GOSPEL OF THY PEACE ARE GIRT THE BELT FROM WHICH DOTH HANG THE SPIRIT'S SWORD SHALL BREATHE ON DEAD BONES AND THE BONES SHALL LIVE

BUT LOVE IS LIFE TO DIE OF LOVE IS THEN THE ONLY PASS TO HIGHER LIFE THAN THIS ALL LOVE IS DEATH TO LOVING LIVING MEN ALL DEATHS ARE LEAPS ACROSS CLEFTS TO THE ABYSS
I SHOULD NO MORE SHRINK FROM IT THAN FROM THE BREATH THAT MAKES IN THE FROSTY AIR A NIMBUS SHROUD THOU LOVE HAST CONQUERED DEATH AND I ALOUD SHOULD TRIUMPH OVER HIM
WHILE TO HIS FEET MY FAITH CROSSES THE WAYLESS DARK
I AM BUT AS A BEAST BEFORE THEE LORD GREAT POET KING I THANK THEE FOR THE WORD LEAVE NOT THY SON HALF MADE IN BEASTLY GUISE
I THINK MY THOUGHT AND FANCY I THINK THEE LORD WAKE ME UP REND SWIFT MY COFFIN PLANKS I PRAY THEE LET ME LIVE ALIVE AND FREE MY SOUL WILL BREAK FORTH IN MELODIOUS THANKS

YE ARE MY BELIEVERS BUT OF WHAT ACCOUNT ARE ALL BELIEVERS YE HAD NOT YET SOUGHT YOURSELVES THEN DID YE FIND ME SO DO ALL BELIEVERS THEREFORE
UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY TWO IF EVER MY WRATH HATH BURST GRAVES SHIFTED LANDMARKS
WHAT SHOULD YE HAVE IN COMMON WITH CATS AND WOLVES IT IS YOUR THIRST TO BECOME SACRIFICES AND GIFTS YOURSELVES AND THEREFORE
WHAT IS FRAGMENT AND RIDDLE AND FEARFUL CHANCE AND HOW COULD I ENDURE TO BE A MAN IF MAN WERE NOT ALSO THE COMPOSER AND RIDDLE READER AND REDEEMER OF CHANCE
IT WAS THE BODY WHICH DESPAIRED OF THE BODY IT GROPED WITH THE FINGERS OF THE INFATUATED SPIRIT AT THE ULTIMATE WALLS BELIEVE ME MY BRETHREN IT WAS THE BODY WHICH DESPAIRED OF THE EARTH
FOR THERE IS A SALT WHICH UNITETH GOOD WITH EVIL
THE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE WOULDST THOU GO INTO ISOLATION MY BROTHER WOULDST THOU SEEK THE WAY UNTO THYSELF TARRY YET A LITTLE AND HEARKEN UNTO ME HE WHO SEEKETH
NOBODY CARRIETH GOLD IN HIS MOUTH
NEVER YET HAVE I FOUND THE WOMAN BY WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
A BESTOWING VIRTUE IS THE HIGHEST VIRTUE VERILY I DIVINE YOU WELL MY DISCIPLES YE STRIVE LIKE ME FOR THE BESTOWING VIRTUE
VERILY LAUGHTER ITSELF HAST THOU SPREAD OUT OVER US LIKE A MANY HUED CANOPY
FOR THAT DO I WAIT THE WICKEDEST OF ALL FISH CATCHERS OUT OUT MY FISHING HOOK IN AND DOWN THOU BAIT OF MY HAPPINESS DRIP THY SWEETEST DEW
AND FOR THE MARRIAGE RING OF RINGS THE RING OF THE RETURN NEVER YET HAVE I FOUND THE WOMAN BY WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
THEN DID MY FEET SWING WITH DANCE FURY MY HEELS REARED ALOFT MY TOES THEY HEARKENED THEE THEY WOULD KNOW HATH NOT THE DANCER HIS EAR IN HIS TOE
WOULD THAT A STORM CAME AND SHOOK ALL THIS ROTTENNESS AND WORM EATENNESS FROM THE TREE WOULD THAT THERE CAME PREACHERS OF SPEEDY DEATH
AH YE PREACH PATIENCE WITH WHAT IS EARTHLY THIS EARTHLY IS IT THAT HATH TOO MUCH PATIENCE WITH YOU YE BLASPHEMERS VERILY
IT PLEASETH ME NOT THAT YE SHOULD THEN DESIRE TO BLESS RATHER CURSE A LITTLE ALSO AND SHOULD A GREAT INJUSTICE BEFALL YOU THEN
THEN FLEW THE DOVES TO AND FRO AND PERCHED ON HIS SHOULDER AND CARESSED HIS WHITE HAIR
THERE HATH ALWAYS BEEN SO MUCH FLOWN AWAY VIRTUE LEAD LIKE ME THE FLOWN AWAY VIRTUE BACK TO THE EARTH YEA BACK TO BODY AND LIFE
SHE IS NOT AT ANY RATE A FIT COMPANION FOR YOU IT WAS YOU WHO INTRODUCED ME TO HER HOLD YOUR TONGUE ABOUT HER
HE HAD THE POWER HE KNEW OF PUTTING AN END TO THE THING ALTOGETHER HE HAD ONLY TO SAY RESOLUTELY AND UNCHANGEABLY THAT THE THING SHOULDN'T BE AND IT WOULDN'T BE
RATHER EXCEEDING THE AVERAGE PROPORTIONS AS WELL AS HEIGHT OF WOMEN HER FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND HANDSOME AND HER FORM WAS PERFECT BUT IT WAS BY HER MANNER AND HER VOICE THAT SHE CONQUERED RATHER THAN BY HER BEAUTY
IF HE DID NOT MEAN YOU TO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF WHY DIDN'T HE KEEP A CLOSER LOOK OUT I HAVEN'T CHOSEN ANY ONE AUNT HARRIET WELL TO SPEAK FAIRLY I THOUGHT YOU HAD AND I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST YOUR CHOICE
IN REGARD TO MAGNIFICENCE AND HOSPITALITY SHE SAID NOTHING OF ANY EXTRAORDINARY EXPENDITURE OF MONEY BUT SHE SET HERSELF TO WORK AFTER HER OWN FASHION MAKING TO HIM SUGGESTIONS AS TO DINNERS AND EVENING RECEPTIONS
AND THE AMOUNT OF SALARY WHICH WAS TO BE ATTACHED TO IT WHETHER HE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU I CANNOT SAY I SHOULD THINK NOT UNLESS HE BE FORCED
HAVEN'T YOU MISSUS LOPEZ OH DEAR EXCLAIMED THE SOFT HEARTED WOMAN REDUCED AT ONCE TO PITY HOW WAS IT THEN
AND THIS HE HAD DONE WITHOUT EVER HAVING ASKED FOR HER LOVE AND HE HAD EVEN TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO ALLURE DICK AND HAD LISTENED TO AND HAD TALKED WHOLE PAGES OUT OF BELL'S LIFE ON HIS OWN BEHALF IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT HAS RUINED HIM WHAT ARE WE TO DO MISSUS LOPEZ I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MY HUSBAND'S BUSINESS MISSUS PARKER YOU'RE ONE WITH HIM AIN'T YOU
SO I AM TOLD SHE OUGHT TO KNOW HER WAY ABOUT THE PLACE AS I REMEMBER SHE WAS AT THE SAME WORK WHEN I WAS A GIRL OF ELEVEN THAT'S NOT SO VERY LONG AGO CORA SILVERBRIDGE IS OLDER NOW THAN I WAS THEN
NEITHER AT DINNER ON THAT EVENING AT MANCHESTER SQUARE NOR AFTER DINNER AS LONG AS MISSUS ROBY REMAINED IN THE HOUSE WAS A WORD SAID ABOUT LOPEZ BY MISTER WHARTON HE REMAINED LONGER THAN USUAL WITH HIS BOTTLE OF PORT WINE IN THE DINING ROOM
THAT HE MIGHT BE FIRM AGAINST HER I DON'T THINK THAT IT BECOMES YOU TO ASK YOUR FATHER SUCH A QUESTION AS THAT YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE CHIEF OBJECT OF MY LIFE TO DO THE BEST I CAN FOR MY CHILDREN I AM SURE IT IS
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW CONSTANTLY I CARRY YOU ABOUT WITH ME YOU CARRY A VERY UNNECESSARY BURDEN THEN SHE SAID BUT HE COULD TELL AT ONCE FROM THE ALTERED TONE OF HER VOICE AND FROM THE LIGHT OF HER EYE AS HE GLANCED INTO HER FACE
HE'D PREY UPON ANYBODY AS HE COULD GET A HOLD OF AND SO MISTER WHARTON YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN DO NOTHING FOR ME IF YOUR WANT BE IMMEDIATE I CAN RELIEVE IT
THE POOR WOMAN BURST INTO TEARS WHO'S TO TRUST HIM WITH BUSINESS NOW HE'S THAT BROKEN HEARTED THAT HE DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN ONLY TO THE BOTTLE
WHICH STRANGERS DID NOT FIND ON HER FACE BUT AS WE DO NOT LIGHT UP OUR HOUSES WITH OUR BRIGHTEST LAMPS FOR ALL COMERS SO NEITHER DID SHE EMIT FROM HER EYES THEIR BRIGHTEST SPARKS TILL SPECIAL OCCASION FOR SUCH SHINING HAD ARISEN
TO LIVE OUT OF ENGLAND YES AT A PLACE THEY CALL I FORGET WHAT THEY CALL IT BUT I HEARD IT GUATEMALA
YOU WILL I AM SURE SAY NOTHING UNKIND TO A LADY WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE PLACE SHE NOW FILLS BY MY AUTHORITY BUT DO NOT LET US QUARREL ABOUT AN OLD WOMAN I WON'T QUARREL WITH YOU EVEN ABOUT A YOUNG ONE
HE CAME TO ME TO DAY AND ASKED FOR MY PERMISSION TO ADDRESS YOU SHE SAT PERFECTLY QUIET STILL LOOKING AT HIM BUT SHE DID NOT SAY A WORD OF COURSE I DID NOT GIVE HIM PERMISSION WHY OF COURSE PAPA
THE DESIRE FOR PLOUGHING HAD COME UPON THE DUCHESS BUT THE DUKE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT HE PERCEIVED HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF HIS OFFICIAL WORK THAT HIS REFUSAL SAT HEAVILY ON HIS WIFE'S BREAST AND THAT THOUGH SHE SPOKE NO FURTHER WORD
BUT WHY DO THEY COME TO ME WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN LIKE DOGS CRAVING A BONE IT USED NOT TO BE SO OF COURSE MEN WERE ALWAYS ANXIOUS FOR OFFICE AS THEY ARE NOW WELL YES WE'VE HEARD OF THAT BEFORE TO DAY I THINK
BUT SHE IS IN TRUTH THE ONLY WOMAN IN LONDON TO WHOM I CAN SAY WHAT I THINK AND IT IS A COMFORT YOU KNOW TO HAVE SOME ONE IN THIS WAY THE DOMESTIC PEACE OF THE PRIME MINISTER WAS READJUSTED
THE TIME SHOULD COME HE WOULD BUY HIS DAUGHTER'S RELEASE AT ANY PRICE THAT MIGHT BE DEMANDED MISTER WALKER THE ATTORNEY HAD AS YET BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE NOTHING
OR HER SULLENNESS IF EVER SHE WERE SULLEN UPSET HIM ALTOGETHER HE WAS IN TRUTH SO SOFT OF HEART
HE WAS AS CONVINCED AS EVER THAT UNLESS THERE WAS MUCH TO CONCEAL THERE WOULD NOT BE SO MUCH CONCEALMENT BUT A FEELING BEGAN TO GROW UPON HIM ALREADY THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD A MODE OF PLEADING WITH HIM WHICH HE WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO RESIST
WHICH MISTER WHARTON OFFERED TO HER AFTER SUCH AN INTERVIEW AS THAT THE DINNER BETWEEN THE FATHER AND THE DAUGHTER WAS NOT VERY HAPPY SHE WAS EATEN UP BY REMORSE
PAPA I WISH YOU KNEW HIM BETTER THAN YOU DO I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW HIM BETTER IS NOT THAT PREJUDICE PAPA MY DEAR EMILY SAID MISTER WHARTON STRIVING TO WAX INTO ANGER
YES I DO HE CERTAINLY COULDN'T GO AS LORD LIEUTENANT BUT THEY SAID THAT BARRINGTON ERLE WAS GOING TO IRELAND WELL YES I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'D BE INTERESTED BY ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF IT
THE ONE MAN IN PARLIAMENT MODEST ENOUGH NOT TO CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE FIT FOR ANY PLACE THAT CAN BE OFFERED TO HIM POOR BARRINGTON HE DOES NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF CROSSING THE CHANNEL SO OFTEN I QUITE SYMPATHISE WITH HIM AND SO PHINEAS IS TO BE SECRETARY FOR IRELAND
WHEN HE GOES I MUST GO WITH HIM WHY SHOULD YOU BE SACRIFICED ALSO I WILL TELL HIM THAT HE MUST LEAVE THE HOUSE I AM NOT AFRAID OF HIM PAPA
IF YOU WAS TURNED OUT INTO THE STREET WITH YOUR BABBY AS I AM LIKE TO BE I HAVE NO BABY SAID THE WRETCHED WOMAN THROUGH HER TEARS AND SOBS
AN ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONAGE THE MATTER AFFECTED OUR DUKE ONLY IN SO FAR THAT HE COULD NOT GET OUT OF HIS MIND THAT STRANGE APPLICATION FROM HIS OWN WIFE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE EVEN DREAMED OF IT HE WOULD SAY TO HIMSELF
INJURY HAD PERHAPS ALREADY BEEN DONE IT MAY BE THAT SOME SLIGHTEST SOIL HAD ALREADY MARRED THE PURE WHITE OF THE GIRL'S NATURAL CHARACTER BUT IF SO THE STAIN WAS AS YET TOO IMPALPABLE TO BE VISIBLE TO ORDINARY EYES
MISTER LOPEZ SIR HAS RUINED US ROOT AND BRANCH ROOT AND BRANCH THAT AT ANY RATE IS NOT MY FAULT SAID MISTER WHARTON
THERE WAS SO MUCH OF INDECISION IN HER HUSBAND'S MANNER AND APPARENTLY SO LITTLE DONE BY HIM IN REGARD TO PERSONAL PREPARATION THAT SHE COULD HARDLY BRING HERSELF TO FEEL CERTAIN
BUT AS SOON AS MISSUS ROBY WAS GONE AND MISSUS ROBY WENT HOME ROUND THE CORNER SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN USUAL THEN MISTER WHARTON WOKE UP INSTANTLY AND MADE INQUIRY OF HIS DAUGHTER
THAT A LADY WANTED TO SEE HER SERVANTS HAVE A WAY OF ANNOUNCING A WOMAN AS A LADY WHICH CLEARLY EXPRESSES THEIR OWN OPINION THAT THE PERSON IN QUESTION IS NOT A LADY
IN THE RIGHT WAY TO GO TO BEDLAM AND NOT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT IT TO THE GRAND RELATIONS OF HIM WHO DID IT ALL HE IS A BAD MAN SAID MISTER WHARTON
WHETHER IT IS MORE DISHONEST AND WHETHER STRUGGLES WERE NOT MADE QUITE AS DISGRACEFUL TO THE STRUGGLERS AS ANYTHING THAT IS DONE NOW YOU CAN'T ALTER THE MEN AND YOU MUST USE THEM THE YOUNGER DUKE SAT DOWN AND SIGHED OVER THE DEGENERATE PATRIOTISM OF THE AGE
THIS SHE SAID WITH A SMILE AS THOUGH NOT MEANING IT ALTOGETHER BUT YET HALF MEANING IT I HAVE ASKED HIM TO UNDERTAKE THE OFFICE SAID THE DUKE SOLEMNLY BECAUSE I AM TOLD THAT HE IS FIT FOR IT
BECAUSE IT WAS FELT ON ALL SIDES THAT SIR ORLANDO COULD NOT JOIN THE NEW COMPOSITE PARTY WITHOUT HIGH PLACE AND THE SAME GRACE WAS SHOWN IN REGARD TO LORD DRUMMOND WHO REMAINED AT THE COLONIES KEEPING THE OFFICE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN LATELY TRANSFERRED UNDER MISTER DAUBENY
NOT LONG AGO SOME OF OUR YOUNG MEN SPENT A HOLIDAY IN REBUILDING A CABIN FOR A HELPLESS COLOURED WOMEN WHO WAS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OLD AT ANOTHER TIME I REMEMBER THAT I MADE IT KNOWN IN CHAPEL ONE NIGHT
OF THE STUDENTS TO BEING TAUGHT TO WORK BY THIS TIME IT HAD GOTTEN TO BE PRETTY WELL ADVERTISED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT EVERY STUDENT WHO CAME TO TUSKEGEE
AND IMPORTANT BUILDINGS DURING THE LAST EIGHT YEARS
THAT MEALS MUST BE SERVED AT CERTAIN FIXED AND REGULAR HOURS AND THIS WAS A SOURCE OF GREAT WORRY EVERYTHING WAS SO OUT OF JOINT AND SO INCONVENIENT THAT I FEEL SAFE IN SAYING THAT FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS
I HAVE REFERRED TO THE DISPOSITION ON THE PART OF THE WHITE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN OF TUSKEGEE AND VICINITY TO HELP THE SCHOOL FROM THE FIRST I RESOLVED TO MAKE THE SCHOOL A REAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH IT WAS LOCATED
WE WERE TRYING AN EXPERIMENT THAT OF TESTING WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR NEGROES TO BUILD UP AND CONTROL THE AFFAIRS OF A LARGE EDUCATION INSTITUTION I KNEW THAT IF WE FAILED IT WOULD INJURE THE WHOLE RACE
AT HAMPTON THE STUDENT WAS CONSTANTLY MAKING THE EFFORT THROUGH THE INDUSTRIES TO HELP HIMSELF AND THAT VERY EFFORT WAS OF IMMENSE VALUE IN CHARACTER BUILDING
BUT IT IS VASTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE BE PREPARED FOR THE EXERCISES OF THESE PRIVILEGES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A DOLLAR IN A FACTORY JUST NOW IS WORTH INFINITELY MORE THAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND A DOLLAR IN AN OPERA HOUSE
STILL I HAD FOLLOWED MY USUAL RULE OF DOING MY DUTY IF I HAD NOT SEEN HIM I SHOULD HAVE FELT UNHAPPY OVER NEGLECT OF DUTY TWO YEARS AFTER THIS VISIT A LETTER CAME TO TUSKEGEE FROM THIS MAN WHICH READ LIKE THIS
MISTAKES I KNEW WOULD BE MADE BUT THESE MISTAKES WOULD TEACH US VALUABLE LESSONS FOR THE FUTURE DURING THE NOW NINETEEN YEARS EXISTENCE OF THE TUSKEGEE SCHOOL
I NEVER WENT TO A WHITE OR A BLACK PERSON IN THE TOWN OF TUSKEGEE FOR ANY ASSISTANCE THAT WAS IN THEIR POWER TO RENDER WITHOUT BEING HELPED ACCORDING TO THEIR MEANS MORE THAN A DOZEN TIMES WHEN BILLS FIGURING UP INTO THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS WERE FALLING DUE
WHO TRIED TO CONVINCE ME FROM THE EXPERIENCE ADAM HAD IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN THAT GOD HAD CURSED ALL LABOUR AND THAT THEREFORE IT WAS A SIN FOR ANY MAN TO WORK FOR THAT REASON THIS MAN SOUGHT TO DO AS LITTLE WORK AS POSSIBLE
THE MORE BOOKS THE LARGER THEY WERE AND THE LONGER THE TITLES PRINTED UPON THEM THE BETTER PLEASED THE STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS SEEMED TO BE I GAVE LITTLE HEED TO THESE PROTESTS
ABOUT THE GENERAL CONDUCT OF THE SCHOOL MORE THAN ONCE I HAVE FOUND MYSELF IN SOME PRETTY TIGHT PLACES WHILE COLLECTING MONEY IN THE NORTH THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT I HAVE NEVER RELATED BUT ONCE BEFORE
HE LISTENED WITH SOME DEGREE OF INTEREST TO WHAT I HAD TO SAY BUT DID NOT GIVE ME ANYTHING I COULD NOT HELP HAVING THE FEELING THAT IN A MEASURE THE THREE HOURS THAT I HAD SPENT IN SEEING HIM HAD BEEN THROWN AWAY
RECTOR OF TRINITY CHURCH BOSTON TO PREACH THE COMMENCEMENT SERMON AS WE THEN HAD NO ROOM LARGE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE ALL WHO WOULD BE PRESENT THE PLACE OF MEETING WAS UNDER A LARGE IMPROVISED ARBOUR
NO PROVISION HAD BEEN MADE IN THE NEW BUILDING FOR A KITCHEN AND DINING ROOM BUT WE DISCOVERED THAT BY DIGGING OUT A LARGE AMOUNT OF EARTH FROM UNDER THE BUILDING WE COULD MAKE A PARTIALLY LIGHTED BASEMENT ROOM
PERHAPS NO ONE WHO HAS NOT GONE THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE MONTH AFTER MONTH OF TRYING TO ERECT BUILDINGS AND PROVIDE EQUIPMENT FOR A SCHOOL WHEN NO ONE KNEW WHERE THE MONEY WAS TO COME FROM
WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THE LAYING OF THIS CORNER STONE TOOK PLACE IN THE HEART OF THE SOUTH IN THE BLACK BELT IN THE CENTRE OF THAT PART OF OUR COUNTRY THAT WAS MOST DEVOTED TO SLAVERY
AND FINALLY GREW SO EXCITED THAT I LEFT THE HOUSE WITHOUT WAITING FOR A REPLY FROM THE LADY A FEW BLOCKS FROM THAT HOUSE I CALLED TO SEE A GENTLEMAN WHO RECEIVED ME IN THE MOST CORDIAL MANNER HE WROTE ME HIS CHECK FOR A GENEROUS SUM
FOR A DOZEN YEARS I MADE A STRONG EFFORT TO CONVINCE MISTER HUNTINGTON OF THE VALUE OF OUR WORK I NOTED THAT JUST IN PROPORTION AS THE USEFULNESS OF THE SCHOOL GREW HIS DONATIONS INCREASED
EXCEPT THAT I LOST NO OPPORTUNITY TO GO INTO AS MANY PARTS OF THE STATE AS I COULD FOR THE PURPOSE OF SPEAKING TO THE PARENTS AND SHOWING THEM THE VALUE OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION BESIDES
IF YOU WISH FURTHER INFORMATION I SHALL BE GLAD TO FURNISH IT YOURS TRULY BOOKER T WASHINGTON PRINCIPAL THE NEXT MAIL BROUGHT BACK THE FOLLOWING REPLY
WHAT RULE OR RULES I FOLLOWED TO SECURE THE INTEREST AND HELP OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE MONEY TO WORTHY OBJECTS AS FAR AS THE SCIENCE OF WHAT IS CALLED BEGGING CAN BE REDUCED TO RULES
WITH WHICH TO RENEW THE BRICKMAKING EXPERIMENT I RETURNED TO TUSKEGEE AND WITH THE HELP OF THE FIFTEEN DOLLARS RALLIED OUR RATHER DEMORALIZED AND DISCOURAGED FORCES AND BEGAN A FOURTH ATTEMPT TO MAKE BRICKS
WHEN THE GROUP OF JURORS TO WHICH I WAS ASSIGNED MET FOR ORGANIZATION MISTER THOMAS NELSON PAGE WHO WAS ONE OF THE NUMBER MOVED THAT I BE MADE SECRETARY OF THAT DIVISION AND THE MOTION WAS UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED NEARLY HALF OF OUR DIVISION WERE SOUTHERN PEOPLE
MISS DAVIDSON KEPT UP THE WORK OF SECURING MONEY IN THE NORTH AND IN THE SOUTH BY INTERESTING PEOPLE BY PERSONAL VISITS AND THROUGH CORRESPONDENCE AT THE SAME TIME SHE KEPT IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE WORK AT TUSKEGEE
THE PLAN OF HAVING THE BUILDINGS ERECTED BY STUDENT LABOUR HAS BEEN ADHERED TO IN THIS TIME FORTY BUILDINGS COUNTING SMALL AND LARGE HAVE BEEN BUILT AND ALL EXCEPT FOUR ARE ALMOST WHOLLY THE PRODUCT OF STUDENT LABOUR
I HAVE ADVISED OUR PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH TO MAKE FRIENDS IN EVERY STRAIGHTFORWARD MANLY WAY WITH THEIR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR WHETHER HE BE A BLACK MAN OR A WHITE MAN I HAVE ALSO ADVISED THEM WHERE NO PRINCIPLE IS AT STAKE
IN ONE CABIN I NOTICE THAT ALL THAT THE FIVE CHILDREN HAD TO REMIND THEM OF THE COMING OF CHRIST WAS A SINGLE BUNCH OF FIRECRACKERS WHICH THEY HAD DIVIDED AMONG THEM IN ANOTHER CABIN WHERE THERE WERE AT LEAST A HALF DOZEN PERSONS
AND HE IS FAST LEARNING THE LESSON THAT HE CANNOT AFFORD TO ACT IN A MANNER THAT WILL ALIENATE HIS SOUTHERN WHITE NEIGHBOURS FROM HIM
TO BE MORE CORRECT I THINK I SHOULD SAY THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHEN ONE TAKES A BROAD SURVEY OF THE COUNTRY HE WILL FIND THAT THE MOST USEFUL AND INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN IT ARE THOSE WHO TAKE THE DEEPEST INTEREST
MISS DAVIDSON DECIDED TO GO NORTH FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR WEEKS SHE VISITED INDIVIDUALS AND SPOKE IN CHURCHES AND BEFORE SUNDAY SCHOOLS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS
OF THE GREEK AND LATIN LANGUAGES WOULD MAKE ONE A VERY SUPERIOR HUMAN BEING SOMETHING BORDERING ALMOST ON THE SUPERNATURAL I REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST COLOURED MAN WHOM I SAW WHO KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT FOREIGN LANGUAGES
NEVER DID I MEET AN INDIVIDUAL WHO TOOK A MORE KINDLY AND SYMPATHETIC INTEREST IN OUR SCHOOL THAN DID MISTER HUNTINGTON HE NOT ONLY GAVE MONEY TO US BUT TOOK TIME IN WHICH TO ADVISE ME AS A FATHER WOULD A SON
FOR THE ELEVATION OF THE BLACK MAN WOULD HAVE MADE ME A CHRISTIAN IN A LARGE DEGREE IT HAS BEEN THE PENNIES THE NICKELS AND THE DIMES WHICH HAVE COME FROM THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOUR SOCIETIES
WERE STRONG UPRIGHT USEFUL MEN NEITHER WERE ALL THE CLASS DESIGNATED AS CARPETBAGGERS DISHONOURABLE MEN SOME OF THEM LIKE EX GOVERNOR BULLOCK OF GEORGIA WERE MEN OF HIGH CHARACTER AND USEFULNESS
BUT ONE THAT NEVERTHELESS IS REAL IN WASHINGTON I SAW GIRLS WHOSE MOTHERS WERE EARNING THEIR LIVING BY LAUNDRYING
WHEREVER ONE OF OUR BRICKMAKERS HAS GONE IN THE SOUTH WE FIND THAT HE HAS SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY INTO WHICH HE HAS GONE
THIS IN A LARGE MEASURE HELPED TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE PLEASANT RELATIONS THAT HAVE CONTINUED TO EXIST BETWEEN US AND THE WHITE PEOPLE IN THAT SECTION AND WHICH NOW EXTEND THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH
THE DISCUSSION WAS OVER THE QUESTION AS TO WHOSE TURN IT WAS TO USE THE COFFEE CUP THAT MORNING ONE BOY WON THE CASE BY PROVING THAT FOR THREE MORNINGS HE HAD NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE CUP AT ALL
IN CONCLUSION MAY I REPEAT THAT NOTHING IN THIRTY YEARS HAS GIVEN US MORE HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT
HE SAW A FIGURE STANDING BY THE MAST FOR A MOMENT HE LOOKED ON IT AND THEN THE FIGURE BECAME SHADOWY
ALL STROVE TO ADD A GRACE OR A BEAUTY TO THE WORK OF HEPHAESTUS ZEUS
AS THE HYDRA CAME NEAR HE KNOCKED HEAD AFTER HEAD OFF ITS BODY BUT FOR EVERY HEAD KNOCKED OFF TWO GREW UPON THE HYDRA AND AS HE STRUGGLED WITH THE MONSTER A HUGE CRAB CAME OUT OF THE SWAMP
HE LOST MEMORY OF HIS BROTHER CHAINED BY ZEUS TO THE ROCK HE LOST MEMORY OF THE WARNING THAT HIS BROTHER THE WISEST OF ALL BEINGS HAD SENT HIM HE TOOK THE HANDS OF PANDORA
AND THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE OUT OF IT THE SALVES AND THE CHARMS AND THE WASHES THAT WOULD LEAVE THEM AS BEAUTIFUL AS PANDORA SO THE WOMEN WENT TO THAT PLACE ON THEIR WAY THEY STOPPED AT A POOL
THERE CAME INTO HIS SCATTERED MIND REGRET AND FEAR AS HE WENT ON HE STUMBLED HE FELL FROM THE EDGE OF A CLIFF AND THE SEA WASHED AWAY THE BODY OF THE MINDLESS BROTHER OF PROMETHEUS
HE SAW THE FIELD RISING INTO MOUNDS
THEY WERE BLACK AND GRAY AND RED THEY WERE CRAWLING AND FLYING THINGS AND AS THE WOMEN LOOKED THE THINGS SPREAD THEMSELVES ABROAD OR FASTENED THEMSELVES UPON THEM THE JAR LIKE PANDORA HERSELF
PROMETHEUS CALLED THE FORESEER BUT EPIMETHEUS HIMSELF WAS SLOW WITTED AND SCATTER BRAINED HIS WISE BROTHER ONCE SENT HIM A MESSAGE BIDDING HIM BEWARE OF THE GIFTS THAT ZEUS MIGHT SEND HIM EPIMETHEUS HEARD
AND PUT HIS GREAT HANDS UPON ITS THROAT NO GROWL CAME OUT OF ITS MOUTH BUT THE GREAT EYES BLAZED WHILE THE TERRIBLE PAWS TORE AT HERACLES AGAINST THE ROCK HERACLES HELD THE BEAST STRONGLY HE HELD IT CHOKING IT THROUGH THE SKIN THAT WAS ALMOST IMPENETRABLE
I HAVE COME TO TAKE UP THE LABORS THAT YOU WILL LAY UPON ME SPEAK NOW EURYSTHEUS AND TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO EURYSTHEUS THAT WEAK KING LOOKING ON THE YOUNG MAN WHO STOOD AS TALL
THE HARD GROUND WAS TORN UP BY THE PLOW OF ADAMANT AND THE CLODS GROANED AS THEY WERE CAST UP JASON FLUNG THE TEETH BETWEEN THE OPEN SODS OFTEN TURNING HIS HEAD IN FEAR THAT THE DEADLY CROP OF THE EARTH BORN MEN WERE RISING BEHIND HIM
RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE EARTH BORN MEN THE STONE CAME THEY LEAPED UPON IT LIKE HOUNDS STRIKING AT ONE ANOTHER AS THEY CAME TOGETHER SHIELD CRASHED ON SHIELD SPEAR RANG UPON SPEAR AS THEY STRUCK AT EACH OTHER
OR BUILDING HOUSES AND THE WOMEN WOULD LEAVE OFF SPINNING OR WEAVING AND COME AT HIS CALL AND STAND ABOUT AND ADMIRE THE GOLDEN MAID BUT AS TIME WENT BY A CHANGE CAME UPON THE WOMEN ONE WOMAN WOULD WEEP
A STORY WAS TOLD CASTOR BEGAN IT AND POLYDEUCES ENDED IT AND THE STORY THAT HELEN'S BROTHERS TOLD WAS THE GOLDEN MAID EPIMETHEUS THE TITAN HAD A BROTHER WHO WAS THE WISEST OF ALL BEINGS
WALKED IN THE GARDEN WITH THE GOLDEN MAID OR WATCHED HER WHILE SHE GAZED ON HERSELF IN THE STREAM OR SEARCHED IN THE UNTENDED PLACES FOR THE FRUITS THAT THE ELDER GODS WOULD EAT WHEN THEY FEASTED WITH THE TITANS IN THE OLD DAYS BEFORE ZEUS HAD COME TO HIS POWER
AND THEY WOULD COME TO DESPISE THEMSELVES LEAVE LEMNOS SHE CRIED AND DRAW ARGO INTO THE SEA AND DEPART FOR COLCHIS ALL DAY THE ARGONAUTS STAYED BY THEMSELVES HUNTING THE BULLS
THERE WAS NO BIRD NOR FLOWER NOR BRANCH PAINTED UPON IT IT STOOD HIGH AS A WOMAN'S SHOULDER AND AS THE WOMEN LOOKED ON IT THEY THOUGHT THAT THERE WERE THINGS ENOUGH IN IT TO KEEP THEM BEAUTIFUL FOR ALL THE DAYS OF THEIR LIVES
AS YET THE FURROWS WERE FREE OF THE EARTH BORN MEN JASON WENT DOWN TO THE RIVER AND FILLED HIS HELMET FULL OF WATER AND DRANK DEEPLY AND HIS KNEES THAT WERE STIFFENED WITH THE PLOWING HE BENT UNTIL THEY WERE MADE SUPPLE AGAIN
HE WENT TO THE CITY'S GATE AND HE MET SUCH A MAN ARGUS WAS HIS NAME HE TOLD JASON THAT A DREAM HAD SENT HIM TO THE CITY OF IOLCUS JASON WELCOMED HIM AND LODGED HIM IN THE KING'S PALACE
THERE WERE MEN FIGHTING AND WOMEN WATCHING FROM HIGH TOWERS THE AWFUL FIGURE OF THE DARKNESS OF DEATH WAS SHOWN THERE TOO WITH MOURNFUL EYES AND THE DUST OF BATTLES UPON HER SHOULDERS THE OUTER RIM OF THE SHIELD
HERACLES TOLD THE KING THAT HE WOULD CLEAN THE STABLES IF HE WERE GIVEN ONE TENTH OF THE CATTLE AND THE GOATS FOR A REWARD THE KING AGREED TO THIS REWARD
AND SHE IN HER STRANGE WAY OF SPEAKING SAID WHAT YOU TOLD US I HAVE REMEMBERED HOW YOU WILL COME TO THE DANGEROUS PASSAGE THAT LEADS INTO THE SEA OF PONTUS
GREATLY THEY REVERENCED PROMETHEUS WHO HAD GIVEN THEM FIRE AND GREATLY THEY REVERENCED THE RACE OF THE TITANS SO WHEN EPIMETHEUS CAME AMONGST THEM
AND HOW BY THE FLIGHT OF A PIGEON YOU WILL KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU MAY GO THAT WAY O JASON
SINCE PROMETHEUS HAD GIVEN THEM FIRE THEY HAD GOOD FRUITS OF THEIR TOIL THEY HAD WELL SHAPED TOOLS TO DIG THE EARTH AND TO BUILD HOUSES THEIR HOMES WERE WARMED WITH FIRE AND FIRE BURNED UPON THE ALTARS THAT WERE UPON THEIR WAYS
AND HE SAID O EPIMETHEUS FATHER ZEUS WOULD BE RECONCILED WITH THEE AND AS A SIGN OF HIS GOOD WILL HE SENDS THEE THIS LOVELY GODDESS TO BE THY COMPANION
NOW HAVE WE THE HOPE OF LOOKING UPON OUR FATHERS AND OUR FRIENDS ONCE MORE
HIGH AS A MAN UPON STILTS WENT GATHERING THE BLOSSOMS OF THE BUSHES FOR HER THEY WENT ON AND THEY CAME AT LAST TO THE PLACE WHERE EPIMETHEUS HAD LEFT THE JAR THAT HELD PANDORA'S DOWER A GREAT STONE JAR IT WAS
AND HE COMMANDED HIM TO MAKE A BEING OUT OF CLAY THAT WOULD HAVE THE LIKENESS OF A LOVELY MAIDEN WITH JOY AND PRIDE HEPHAESTUS WORKED AT THE TASK THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM AND HE FASHIONED A BEING THAT HAD THE LIKENESS OF A LOVELY MAIDEN
HAD BEEN MADE AND FILLED OUT OF THE ILL WILL OF ZEUS AND IT HAD BEEN FILLED NOT WITH SALVES AND CHARMS AND WASHES AS THE WOMEN HAD THOUGHT BUT WITH CARES AND TROUBLES
WONDERFUL TO THE HEROES ARGO LOOKED WITH HER LONG OARS AND HER HIGH SAILS WITH HER TIMBERS PAINTED RED AND GOLD AND BLUE AND WITH A MARVELOUS FIGURE CARVED UPON HER PROW ALL OVER THE SHIP JASON'S EYES WENT
THEN JASON SAW SOMETHING THAT WAS LIKE A CLOUD FILLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE RISING SUN IT HUNG FROM A GREAT OAK TREE
WE SEE YOU AS A FOOLISH MAN UPON STILTS EPIMETHEUS WAS TROUBLED BY THE HARD LOOKS AND THE COLD WORDS OF THE MEN WHO ONCE HAD REVERENCED HIM HE TURNED FROM THE HOUSES AND WENT AWAY IN A QUIET PLACE HE SAT DOWN
BUT THEN ONE AROSE AND ANOTHER AROSE AND THEY STOOD AND WHISPERED TOGETHER
AND THEY SAID IN HARSH VOICES THAT IN A WHILE THEY WOULD HAVE WAYS OF MAKING THEMSELVES AS LOVELY AS THE GOLDEN MAID AND AS THEY WENT ON THEY SAW PANDORA SHE WAS PLAYING IN A FLOWERING FIELD WHILE EPIMETHEUS
STRIKING THE BRAZEN KNEES OF THE BULL SUDDENLY WITH HIS FOOT HE FORCED HIM DOWN THEN HE SMOTE THE OTHER BULL AS IT RUSHED UPON HIM AND IT TOO HE FORCED DOWN UPON ITS KNEES CASTOR AND POLYDEUCES HELD THE YOKE TO HIM
AROUND THESE FIGURES WERE HEADS OF SNAKES HEADS WITH BLACK JAWS AND GLITTERING EYES TWELVE HEADS SUCH AS MIGHT AFFRIGHT ANY MAN
THEN AS HE WENT THROUGH THE FOREST HE PULLED UP A YOUNG OAK TREE AND TRIMMED IT AND MADE A CLUB FOR HIMSELF WITH THE LION'S SKIN OVER HIM THAT SKIN THAT NO SPEAR OR ARROW COULD PIERCE
AND THE SWEET TASTE OF THE FRUITS THAT EPIMETHEUS BROUGHT TO HER COULD HAVE STAYED FOREVER IN THAT GARDEN BUT EVERY DAY EPIMETHEUS WOULD THINK THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE WORLD
FOR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE THE OTHERS HEAR HER WEEPING BY THE COMING OF THE MORNING'S LIGHT THE ARGONAUTS HAD MADE ALL READY FOR THEIR SAILING THEY WERE STANDING ON THE DECK WHEN THE LIGHT CAME AND THEY SAW THE LEMNIAN WOMEN COME TO THE SHORE
MEDEA'S CHARM HAD MADE HIS SHIELD IMPREGNABLE THE RUSH OF THE BULLS DID NOT OVERTHROW HIM HIS COMRADES SHOUTED TO SEE HIM STANDING FIRMLY THERE AND IN WONDER THE COLCHIANS GAZED UPON HIM
NOW ONE DAY AS HE WAS SITTING ON A FALLEN PILLAR IN THE RUINED PLACE THAT WAS NOW FORSAKEN BY THE REST OF THE TITANS HE SAW A PAIR COMING TOWARD HIM ONE HAD WINGS AND HE KNEW HIM TO BE HERMES THE MESSENGER OF THE GODS
THEN WITH THE SPEAR AND SHIELD IN HIS HANDS WITH HIS SWORD GIRT ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS AND WITH HIS MANTLE STRIPPED OFF
THE EARTH BORN MEN AS FAST AS THEY AROSE WENT DOWN BEFORE THE WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF THEIR BRETHREN
I SAW A LITTLE HUT AND BEFORE THE HUT BURNT A FIRE AND ROUND ABOUT THE FIRE A FUNNY LITTLE DWARF WAS DANCING UPON ONE LEG AND SINGING MERRILY THE FEAST I'LL MAKE TODAY I'LL BREW TOMORROW BAKE
THEY WALKED THE WHOLE NIGHT AND ALL THE NEXT DAY TOO FROM MORNING TILL EVENING BUT THEY DID NOT GET OUT OF THE FOREST AND WERE VERY HUNGRY FOR THEY HAD NOTHING TO EAT BUT TWO OR THREE BERRIES WHICH GREW ON THE GROUND
AND REMAINED A WHOLE YEAR WITH THE MASTER AT THE END OF THIS TIME HE CAME HOME AGAIN AND HIS FATHER ASKED NOW MY SON WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT FATHER I HAVE LEARNT WHAT THE DOGS SAY WHEN THEY BARK
WHEN AT LAST THEY AWOKE IT WAS ALREADY DARK NIGHT GRETEL BEGAN TO CRY AND SAID HOW ARE WE TO GET OUT OF THE FOREST NOW BUT HANSEL COMFORTED HER AND SAID JUST WAIT A LITTLE
WHEN SHE WENT HOME THE MOUSE INQUIRED AND WHAT WAS THE CHILD CHRISTENED HALF DONE ANSWERED THE CAT HALF DONE
THAT HE WOULD REST HIMSELF FOR A WHILE AND GAZE ON THE LOVELY SCENES AROUND HIM
NOW THE KING FELT GREAT JOY AT THIS AND COMMANDED THAT HIS ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD SHOULD EAT WITH HIM NEXT DAY AND MADE A GREAT FEAST WHEN THEY WERE ALL ASSEMBLED TOGETHER HE SAID TO THE HUNTSMAN
FLAPPING THEIR WINGS AND CRYING OH WHAT HELPLESS CHICKS WE ARE WE MUST SHIFT FOR OURSELVES AND YET WE CANNOT FLY WHAT CAN WE DO BUT LIE HERE AND STARVE SO THE GOOD YOUNG FELLOW ALIGHTED AND KILLED HIS HORSE WITH HIS SWORD AND GAVE IT TO THEM FOR FOOD
LONG BEFORE THE END OF THE HOUR THE WORK WAS QUITE DONE AND ALL FLEW OUT AGAIN AT THE WINDOWS THEN ASHPUTTEL BROUGHT THE DISH TO HER MOTHER OVERJOYED AT THE THOUGHT THAT NOW SHE SHOULD GO TO THE BALL BUT THE MOTHER SAID NO NO YOU SLUT
WHICH HE HAD FOUND ON A TREE WAS CALLED FUNDEVOGEL BECAUSE A BIRD HAD CARRIED IT AWAY FUNDEVOGEL AND LINA LOVED EACH OTHER SO DEARLY THAT WHEN THEY DID NOT SEE EACH OTHER THEY WERE SAD NOW THE FORESTER HAD AN OLD COOK WHO ONE EVENING TOOK TWO PAILS AND BEGAN TO FETCH WATER
AND THE SNOW FELL AND SPREAD A BEAUTIFUL WHITE COVERING OVER THE GRAVE BUT BY THE TIME THE SPRING CAME AND THE SUN HAD MELTED IT AWAY AGAIN HER FATHER HAD MARRIED ANOTHER WIFE THIS NEW WIFE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS OF HER OWN
IN DAILY HOPE OF HIS SON'S RETURN
IF YOU CAN STAND THERE AND EAT YOUR FILL YOU CAN ALSO GO ON YOUR FOUR LEGS I DON'T CARE TO DRAG YOU HOME AGAIN IN MY ARMS
ALLOWED HIM TO ASK A FAVOUR AND PROMISED HIM THE BEST PLACE IN THE COURT THAT HE COULD WISH FOR THE SERVANT REFUSED EVERYTHING AND ONLY ASKED FOR A HORSE AND SOME MONEY FOR TRAVELLING
THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES THERE WAS A KING WHO HAD TWELVE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS THEY SLEPT IN TWELVE BEDS ALL IN ONE ROOM AND WHEN THEY WENT TO BED THE DOORS WERE SHUT
HE COULD NOT BE WHAT HE SAID HE WAS AND MUST GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS THE SECOND PRINCE SET OUT SOON AFTERWARDS ON THE SAME ERRAND AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE GOLDEN ROAD AND HIS HORSE HAD SET ONE FOOT UPON IT
THAT SHE BROUGHT HOME WITH HER THEY WERE FAIR IN FACE BUT FOUL AT HEART AND IT WAS NOW A SORRY TIME FOR THE POOR LITTLE GIRL WHAT DOES THE GOOD FOR NOTHING WANT IN THE PARLOUR SAID THEY
AND WHEN HE WAS GONE THE CHILDREN WERE STILL IN BED THEN LINA SAID TO FUNDEVOGEL IF YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE ME I TOO WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU FUNDEVOGEL SAID NEITHER NOW NOR EVER WILL I LEAVE YOU THEN SAID LINA
BUT NOW WE MUST BE OFF SAID HANSEL THAT WE MAY GET OUT OF THE WITCH'S FOREST WHEN THEY HAD WALKED FOR TWO HOURS THEY CAME TO A GREAT STRETCH OF WATER WE CANNOT CROSS SAID HANSEL
THEY WHO WOULD EAT BREAD SHOULD FIRST EARN IT AWAY WITH THE KITCHEN MAID THEN THEY TOOK AWAY HER FINE CLOTHES AND GAVE HER AN OLD GREY FROCK TO PUT ON AND LAUGHED AT HER AND TURNED HER INTO THE KITCHEN THERE
THEN SHE WAS IN A GREAT FRIGHT AND CRIED OUT TO CHANTICLEER
THE WINE UNDER THE PILLOW THE SALAD ON THE BED THE CAKES UNDER IT AND THE PARSON IN THE CLOSET ON THE PORCH THEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR FOR HER HUSBAND AND SAID THANK HEAVEN YOU ARE BACK AGAIN
IF YOU COME UP AGAIN WITHOUT IT YOU WILL BE THROWN IN AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL YOU PERISH AMID THE WAVES ALL THE PEOPLE GRIEVED FOR THE HANDSOME YOUTH THEN THEY WENT AWAY LEAVING HIM ALONE BY THE SEA HE STOOD ON THE SHORE AND CONSIDERED WHAT HE SHOULD DO
WHO SET OUT IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE BEFORE ME AND NEVER CAME BACK I HAVE SHUT THEM UP BY A CHARM BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS SAID THE DWARF BECAUSE THEY WERE PROUD AND ILL BEHAVED AND SCORNED TO ASK ADVICE
FATHER I WILL GO IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE FOR HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF MY BROTHER IS SURELY DEAD AND THE KINGDOM WILL FALL TO ME IF I FIND THE WATER THE KING WAS AT FIRST VERY UNWILLING TO LET HIM GO
YOU NAUGHTY CHILDREN WHY HAVE YOU SLEPT SO LONG IN THE FOREST WE THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING BACK AT ALL THE FATHER HOWEVER REJOICED FOR IT HAD CUT HIM TO THE HEART TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND ALONE
THAT HAD BEEN LAID TO DRY OVER A BAKER'S OVEN AND THUS SHE HAD SOME JOKE TO CRACK UPON EVERY ONE BUT SHE LAUGHED MORE THAN ALL AT A GOOD KING WHO WAS THERE LOOK AT HIM SAID SHE
AND HER FATHER MOTHER AND SISTERS WERE GONE ASHPUTTEL WENT TO THE HAZEL TREE AND SAID SHAKE SHAKE HAZEL TREE GOLD AND SILVER OVER ME AND THE BIRD CAME AND BROUGHT A STILL FINER DRESS THAN THE ONE SHE HAD WORN THE DAY BEFORE AND WHEN SHE CAME IN IT TO THE BALL
GET UP LAZY THING FETCH SOME WATER AND COOK SOMETHING GOOD FOR YOUR BROTHER HE IS IN THE STABLE OUTSIDE AND IS TO BE MADE FAT WHEN HE IS FAT I WILL EAT HIM
BLACKBIRD THRUSH AND CHAFFINCH GAY HITHER HITHER HASTE AWAY ONE AND ALL COME HELP ME QUICK HASTE YE HASTE YE PICK PICK PICK THEN FIRST CAME TWO WHITE DOVES IN AT THE KITCHEN WINDOW NEXT CAME TWO TURTLE DOVES
AFTER HE HAD WANDERED THROUGH THREE KINGDOMS HE CAME ONE EVENING TO A WOOD AND LAY DOWN UNDER A TREE TO SLEEP BUT HE HEARD A RUSTLING IN THE BRANCHES AND A GOLDEN APPLE FELL INTO HIS HAND AT THE SAME TIME THREE RAVENS FLEW DOWN TO HIM PERCHED THEMSELVES UPON HIS KNEE AND SAID
IT WILL CERTAINLY GET BIG AND BE A COW THE WOMAN ALSO LIKED THE IDEA AND THEIR GOSSIP THE CARPENTER CUT AND PLANED THE CALF AND PAINTED IT AS IT OUGHT TO BE AND MADE IT WITH ITS HEAD HANGING DOWN AS IF IT WERE EATING NEXT MORNING WHEN THE COWS WERE BEING DRIVEN OUT
AND ON TO THE HAZEL TREE AND HAD THERE TAKEN OFF HER BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES AND PUT THEM BENEATH THE TREE THAT THE BIRD MIGHT CARRY THEM AWAY AND HAD LAIN DOWN AGAIN AMID THE ASHES IN HER LITTLE GREY FROCK THE NEXT DAY WHEN THE FEAST WAS AGAIN HELD
AND THE GRATEFUL CREATURES HAD BY GREAT INDUSTRY PICKED UP ALL THE MILLET SEED AND GATHERED THEM INTO THE SACKS PRESENTLY THE KING'S DAUGHTER HERSELF CAME DOWN INTO THE GARDEN AND WAS AMAZED TO SEE THAT THE YOUNG MAN HAD DONE THE TASK SHE HAD GIVEN HIM BUT SHE COULD NOT YET CONQUER HER PROUD HEART AND SAID
HANS COMES TO GRETEL GOOD DAY GRETEL GOOD DAY HANS WHAT DO YOU BRING THAT IS GOOD I BRING NOTHING I WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING GIVEN ME GRETEL PRESENTS HANS WITH A NEEDLE HANS SAYS GOODBYE GRETEL
AND LOCKED HIM IN BEHIND A GRATED DOOR SCREAM AS HE MIGHT IT WOULD NOT HELP HIM THEN SHE WENT TO GRETEL SHOOK HER TILL SHE AWOKE AND CRIED
AND THEY WENT HOME AND TOLD THE COOK THAT THEY HAD SEEN NOTHING IN THE FOREST BUT A LITTLE ROSE BUSH WITH ONE ROSE ON IT
GOOD DAY HANS WHAT GOOD THING DO YOU BRING I BRING NOTHING BUT WOULD HAVE SOMETHING GIVEN GRETEL SAYS TO HANS I WILL GO WITH YOU HANS TAKES GRETEL TIES HER TO A ROPE LEADS HER TO THE RACK AND BINDS HER FAST THEN HANS GOES TO HIS MOTHER
AND HE RAN TO THE KING AND ACCUSED THE QUEEN OF HAVING ALLOWED HER CHILD TO BE TAKEN FROM HER BY THE WILD BEASTS WHEN THE KING SAW THE BLOOD ON HER APRON HE BELIEVED THIS FELL INTO SUCH A PASSION THAT HE ORDERED A HIGH TOWER TO BE BUILT
APPLES AND NUTS AFTERWARDS TWO PRETTY LITTLE BEDS WERE COVERED WITH CLEAN WHITE LINEN AND HANSEL AND GRETEL LAY DOWN IN THEM AND THOUGHT THEY WERE IN HEAVEN THE OLD WOMAN
AND THEN TO MARRY HIM AND TO GIVE HIM THE KINGDOM THEN THEY ALL THREE RODE ON TOGETHER AND ON THEIR WAY HOME CAME TO A COUNTRY THAT WAS LAID WASTE BY WAR AND A DREADFUL FAMINE
GRETEL BEGAN TO WEEP BITTERLY BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN FOR SHE WAS FORCED TO DO WHAT THE WICKED WITCH COMMANDED AND NOW THE BEST FOOD WAS COOKED FOR POOR HANSEL BUT GRETEL
AND THE DUCK SEEMED MUCH TIRED AND WADDLED ABOUT A GOOD DEAL FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
ALL THIS MUST BE SPUN INTO GOLD BEFORE MORNING AS YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE IT WAS IN VAIN THAT THE POOR MAIDEN SAID THAT IT WAS ONLY A SILLY BOAST OF HER FATHER
SIM COME AWAY BEFORE THEY GOT THAT FAR OF COURSE GED DIDN'T SAY RIGHT OUT IN OPEN MEETIN THAT HE'D GIVE SO MANY DOLLARS FOR YOUR SCALP BUT HE GOT EM ALL INT'RESTED AND IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE HIM SO SIM SAID IF ON THE QUIET SOME OF THOSE PLUG UGLIES HAD AGREED TO DO THE JOB
ASKED HER COUSIN YES THERE FOR THE MOMENT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE DOWNPOUR LIGHTENED VEILED BY THE STILL FALLING WATER A STRAIGHT STICK ROSE HIGH IN THE AIR AHEAD OF THEM
NAN CHOKED IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH THERE MUST BE FIRE UNDER THIS SAWDUST NOW TOM BROUGHT HIS OWN GAZE DOWN FROM THE EMPTY TREE TOP WITH A JERK HOO HE SHOUTED AND LEANED FORWARD SUDDENLY
THAT HAD GRACED HER BEDROOM THESE APPEARED FROM THE TRUNK EVEN BEFORE SHE HUNG AWAY HER CLOTHES IN THE UNPLASTERED CLOSET WHERE THE COLD WIND SEARCHED THROUGH THE CRACKS FROM OUT OF DOORS INTO THAT CLOSET AWAY BACK IN THE CORNER WENT A LONG PASTEBOARD BOX
WITH HIS JOINTS STIFFENED AND MUSCLES THROBBING WITH PAIN TOBY HAD SEEN THE GAUNT WOLF OF STARVATION MORE TERRIBLE THAN ANY TIMBER WOLF WAITING AT HIS DOORSTONE
WHEN THE BOOM WAS BROKEN IN THE MORNING SOMETIMES AN INCREASING CURRENT PILED THE LOGS UP A GOOD BIT IT WAS A FEAR COMPELLING VIEW THE GIRL HAD OF THE RIVER ON ONE DAY
SOME GOING AHEAD AT THE BENDS TO FEND OFF AND BREAK UP ANY FORMATION OF THE DRIFTING TIMBERS THAT PROMISED TO BECOME A JAM BEHIND THE DRIVE FLOATED THE SQUARE
WHAT A FUSS BUDGET YOU ARE TO BE SURE TOM
YES BUT THAT DRESS SHE GIN ME MY BROTHER BOB TOOK AND PUT ON OLD BEAGLE FOR TO DRESS HIM UP FUNNY AND BEAGLE HEARD A NOISE HE THOUGHT WAS A FOX BARKING AND HE STARTED FOR THE TAMARACK SWAMP LICKETY SPLIT
EVEN THE ONE IN NAN'S BEDROOM WAS PROPERLY BANKED BEFORE THE FAMILY RETIRED AT NIGHT NAN HAD ALWAYS IN MIND WHAT UNCLE HENRY SAID ABOUT MENTIONING FIRE TO AUNT KATE
IN A MINUTE HE HAD LOPPED OFF THE BRANCHES FOR TWENTY FEET THEN REMOVED THE TOP WITH A SINGLE BLOW AS HE TURNED DRAGGING THE POLE WITH HIM UP SPRANG THE FIRE AGAIN FROM THE HOLLOW INTO WHICH THE WHEEL OF THE WAGON HAD SUNK
WIZZLED REPEATED NAN PUZZLED
FOR SOME OF THE LOGS HAD BEEN CUT BEFORE THE BIG STORM AND HAD ONLY TO BE BROKEN OUT OF THE DRIFTS AND ROLLED UPON THE SLEDS WITH THE AID OF THE MEN'S CANTHOOKS IT WAS A MYSTERY AT FIRST TO NAN HOW THEY COULD GET THREE HUGE LOGS SOME OF THEM THREE FEET IN DIAMETER AT THE BUTT
WERE BEDDED IN A HEAP OF LEAVES BLOWN BY THE WIND INTO A HOLLOW TREE TRUNK THE TIMBERMAN DRIVING THROUGH THE HOLLOW HAD NOT SEEN THE BOBCAT AND HER THREE BLIND BABIES BUT HE HAD ROUSED THE MOTHER CAT AND SHE WAS NOW ALL READY TO SPRING AT INTRUDERS
YOU TAKE LIVELY FULL MUSCLED ANIMALS AND THEY ARE ALWAYS BUCKING AND QUARRELING TRYING TO SEE WHICH ONE IS THE BEST TAKE TWO YOUNG FAT STEERS THEY'LL LOCK HORNS AT THE DROP OF A HAT IT'S ANIMAL SPIRITS NAN
NOW THE PLUCK PLUCK PLUCK OF THE AXE BLOWS LAID AGAINST THE FOREST MONARCHS REACHED THE GIRL'S EARS SHE THOUGHT THE FLAT STUTTERING SOUND OF THE AXES SAID PLUCK VERY PLAINLY AND THAT THAT WAS JUST THE WORD THEY SHOULD SAY
SO THE CURIOUS YOUNG GIRL KEPT HER LIPS CLOSED UPON THE SUBJECT BUT SHE CERTAINLY WAS DESIROUS OF KNOWING ABOUT THAT FIRE SO LONG AGO AT PALE LICK HOW IT CAME ABOUT
DON'T WANT MARM SHERWOOD TO SEE ME SHE SAID WHY NOT SHE TOLD ME NOT TO COME OVER AFTER YOU COME ITHOUT I PUT ON MY NEW DRESS AND WASHED MY HANDS AND FACE WELL EXCLAIMED NAN LOOKING AT HER MORE CLOSELY YOU SEEM TO HAVE A CLEAN FACE AT LEAST
DIDN'T YOU USTER VISIT EM WHEN THEY LIVED AT PALE LICK NO I DON'T REMEMBER THAT THEY EVER LIVED ANYWHERE ELSE BESIDE HERE YES THEY DID I HEARD GRAN'THER TELL ABOUT IT
CRIED NAN CONSCIENCE STRICKEN IN SPITE OF THE BEATING RAIN AND WIND SHE GOT TO HER KNEES STILL CLINGING TO HER BIG COUSIN AND THEN STOOD UPON THE BROAD TONGUE OF THE WAGON
ON TO THE SLED TWO AT THE BOTTOM AND ONE ROLLED UPON THEM ALL BEING FASTENED SECURELY WITH THE TIMBER CHAIN AND HOOK HOW THE HORSES STRAINED IN THEIR COLLARS TO START THE MIGHTY LOAD
CRACKY DON'T CHOKE A FELLOW HE COUGHED OH TOM
MAKING HER EXIT AS SHE HAD HER ENTRANCE BY THE WINDOW I RECKON YOU NEVER SEEN THIS HOUSE OF YOUR UNCLE'S BEFORE DID YOU QUERIED MARGARET AT ONE POINT IN THE CONVERSATION OH NO I NEVER VISITED THEM BEFORE
AND UNGRACEFULLY SPRAWLED IN THE SNOW UPON HER BACK SHE COULD NOT GET AWAY BEFORE NAN HAD THE WINDOW OPEN THE SASH WAS HELD UP BY A NOTCHED STICK NAN PUT HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS OUT INTO THE FROSTY AIR AND STARED DOWN AT THE PROSTRATE GIRL
FIRE COULDN'T BE DEEP DOWN IN THE SAWDUST AND THE SMOKE COME OUT OF THE TREE TOP COULDN'T HEH RETURNED TOM DEAD TREE WASN'T IT OH YES
THE HORSES STOOD STILL WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN BEARING THE BUFFETING OF THE STORM WITH THE USUAL PATIENCE OF DUMB BEASTS A SHEER WALL OF WATER SEEMED TO SEPARATE THEM FROM EVERY OBJECT OUT UPON THE OPEN LAND
ONLY MADE NAN MORE KEENLY ALIVE TO HIS DANGER SHE DARED NOT DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH AUNT KATE FOR NAN FEARED TO WORRY THAT GOOD WOMAN UNNECESSARILY
THE DEAL TABLE WAS GRACED BY NO CLOTH OR NAPERY OF ANY KIND THERE WERE HEAPS OF POTATOES AND ONIONS FRIED TOGETHER AND GOLDEN CORNBREAD WITH BOWLS OF WHITE GRAVY TO LADLE OVER IT
AND THE SEVERAL OTHER KNICKKNACKS THAT WOULD HELP TO MAKE THE BIG DRESSER LOOK AS THOUGH THERE WAS SOMEBODY AT HOME AS SHE WHISPERED TO HERSELF SHE DRAPED A SCARF HERE HUNG UP A PRETTY SILK BAG THERE
NAN RAISED HER EYES TO ONE WINDOW TO SEE A FACE PRESSED CLOSE AGAINST THE GLASS AND TWO ROLLING CRABLIKE EYES GLARING IN AT HER MERCY EJACULATED NAN SHERWOOD WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THAT CHILD'S EYES THEY'LL DROP OUT OF HER HEAD
BESIDE THE MEN'S BOOTS WHICH WERE PATCHED AND OLD SHE WORE A WOOLLEN SKIRT A BLOUSE AND A SHAWL OVER HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS SHE SHOOK THE SNOW FROM HER GARMENTS MUCH AS A DOG FREES HIMSELF FROM WATER AFTER COMING OUT OF A POND
IT HAD TASSELED EARS A WIDE WICKED SMILE BRISTLING WHISKERS AND FANGS THAT REALLY MADE NAN TREMBLE ALTHOUGH SHE WAS SOME YARDS FROM THE BOBCAT AS SHE BELIEVED FROM WHAT HER COUSINS HAD TOLD HER BOBCATS ARE NOT USUALLY DANGEROUS
SOME ADVISED AN UTTER DISREGARD OF THE LAW OTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY MINDED TO INCREASE THE TROUBLE BETWEEN RAFFER AND UNCLE HENRY BY MALICIOUS TALE BEARING OFTEN NAN THOUGHT OF WHAT UNCLE HENRY HAD SAID TO OLD
NAN SHUDDERED AND HAD LONG SINCE STOPPED EATING BUT NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER AT THE MOMENT UNCLE HENRY DRAWLED THEY'RE GOING TO DO THE HARDEST DAY'S JOB FOR THE SMALLEST PAY THAT THEY EVER DID ON THIS MICHIGAN PENINSULA
AND TWOULD BE A FINE CHIMNEY IF THE FIRE WAS SMOULDERING DOWN AT ITS OLD ROOTS OH TOM I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING GASPED NAN AND YOU DON'T SEE THE TREE NOW
IT WAS A PITIFULLY SMALL SUM RAFFER WOULD ADVANCE UPON THE LITTLE FARM BUT IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO PUT TOBY IN THE USURER'S POWER THIS WAS THE STORY NAN LEARNED REGARDING TOBY
THEY FEEL THAT THEY'VE GOT TO LET OFF STEAM WHERE MUSCLE AND PLUCK COUNT FOR WHAT THEY DO IN THE LUMBER CAMPS THERE'S BOUND TO BE MORE OR LESS RUCTIONS PERHAPS THIS MIGHT BE BUT NAN WAS DREADFULLY SORRY NEVERTHELESS THAT UNCLE HENRY HAD THIS TROUBLE WITH MISTER GEDNEY RAFFER
FOR IT DOES TAKE LOTS OF PLUCK TO DO WORK OF THIS KIND NAN CONFIDED TO HER UNCLE WHO WALKED UP AND DOWN ON THE PORCH SMOKING AN AFTER BREAKFAST PIPE YES NO SOFTIES ALLOWED ON THE JOB SAID HE CHEERFULLY SOME OF THE BOYS MAY BE ROUGH AND HARD NUTS TO CRACK
SHE MURMURED BUT HE DID NOT HEAR THAT HE HAD SEIZED HIS AXE AND WAS STRIDING TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE FOREST
NONE OF THE TEAMS HAD COME BY FOR SOME TIME BUT SHE COULD HEAR FAINTLY THE SOUND OF THE AXES AND THE CALLING OF THE WORKMEN TO EACH OTHER AND THEIR SHARP COMMANDS TO THE HORSES SHE WENT AWAY FROM THE CAMP A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AND THEN FOUND THAT THE TRAIL FORKED
SHE'S JUST CALLED THAT MANY A MAN'S LOST HIS LIFE THERE SINCE I CAME INTO THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT'S A FACT IT'S A DANGEROUS PLACE
WHO IF IT PLEASED HER TO HEAR IT SAID THAT HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE NUMEROUS WAS HAPPILY ABLE TO REFLECT THAT SUCH COMPLACENCY WAS NOT THE INDICATION OF A FEEBLE MIND INASMUCH AS THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS IN WHICH SHE EXCELLED
THERE ARE AS MANY POINTS OF VIEW IN THE WORLD AS THERE ARE PEOPLE OF SENSE TO TAKE THEM YOU MAY SAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM VERY NUMEROUS AMERICAN NEVER IN THE WORLD THAT'S SHOCKINGLY NARROW MY POINT OF VIEW THANK GOD IS PERSONAL
WHATEVER HE DOES WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT ISABEL REPEATED WHEN A MAN'S OF THAT INFALLIBLE MOULD WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO HIM WHAT ONE FEELS IT MAY NOT MATTER TO HIM BUT IT MATTERS TO ONE'S SELF AH
HE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE GAMBLED FREELY A FEW VERY HARSH CRITICS WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN BROUGHT UP HIS DAUGHTERS THEY HAD HAD NO REGULAR EDUCATION AND NO PERMANENT HOME THEY HAD BEEN AT ONCE SPOILED AND NEGLECTED
THE LIVELIEST WALTZES SEEMED TO FLOAT UPON THE AIR ISABEL OFTEN FOUND HERSELF IRRITATED BY THIS PERPETUAL FIDDLING
AND HIS WIFE'S POSITION WAS THAT OF RATHER A GRIM VISITOR SO THAT IN THE LINE OF CONDUCT THAT OPENED ITSELF TO RALPH DUTY AND INCLINATION WERE HARMONIOUSLY MIXED HE WAS NOT A GREAT WALKER BUT HE STROLLED ABOUT THE GROUNDS WITH HIS COUSIN
BY EVERYTHING BUT MISTER GOODWOOD MISS STACKPOLE EXCLAIMED WITH A SLIGHTLY HARSH HILARITY ISABEL FAILED EVEN TO SMILE BACK AND IN A MOMENT SHE SAID DID HE ASK YOU TO SPEAK TO ME NOT IN SO MANY WORDS
THAT IT'S A GREAT DEAL BETTER YOU SHOULD REMAIN WITH ME IN SPITE OF THERE BEING NO OBLIGATION IT'S BETTER FOR SEVERAL REASONS QUITE APART FROM YOUR LIKING IT I SHOULDN'T THINK YOU'D LIKE IT BUT I RECOMMEND YOU TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE
AS YET FOR REGARDING AS AGITATED BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PICTURING TO HERSELF BY THE LIGHT OF HER HOPES HER FEARS HER FANCIES HER AMBITIONS HER PREDILECTIONS
BUT IT WAS NOT WITH A DESIRE FOR DOZING FORGETFULNESS
AS REGARDS THAT SAID ISABEL I SHOULD FIND IN MY OWN NATION ENTERTAINMENT FOR A LIFETIME BUT WE'VE A LONG DRIVE AND MY AUNT WILL SOON WISH TO START SHE TURNED BACK
HE VERY SOON ESTABLISHED WITH HER A REPUTATION FOR TREATING EVERYTHING AS A JOKE AND HE WAS NOT A MAN TO NEGLECT THE PRIVILEGES SUCH A REPUTATION CONFERRED
AND ENTER THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS IT MATTERED LITTLE THAT HE HAD ASSURED HER THEY WERE A VERY DISMAL PLACE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO UNDERTAKE TO SWEEP THEM AND SET THEM IN ORDER IT WAS BUT HALF HOSPITALITY TO LET HER REMAIN OUTSIDE
WHILE HE BRUSHED HIS HAT I'M SURE I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT EXCLAIMED THE GIRL
A GREEK BAS RELIEF TO STICK OVER MY CHIMNEY PIECE THE KEY OF A BEAUTIFUL EDIFICE IS THRUST INTO MY HAND AND I'M TOLD TO WALK IN AND ADMIRE MY POOR BOY YOU'VE BEEN SADLY UNGRATEFUL
WITH A QUICKENED CONSCIOUSNESS OF POSSIBLE FELICITIES IT'S VERY NICE TO KNOW TWO SUCH CHARMING PEOPLE AS THOSE SHE SAID MEANING BY THOSE HER COUSIN AND HER COUSIN'S FRIEND IT MUST BE ADDED MOREOVER
EVEN THAT I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD AH WELL I SHOULD HOPE SO THE YOUNG MAN EXCLAIMED ISABEL MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED IT AND NOT HAVE BEEN FAR FROM THE TRUTH HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PRESENT TO HIS MIND
NODDED GOOD NIGHT AND WITHDREW ACCOMPANIED BY HER AUNT FOR HIMSELF HE WAS ANNOYED AT HIS MOTHER THOUGH HE THOUGHT SHE WAS RIGHT ABOVE STAIRS THE TWO LADIES SEPARATED AT MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DOOR ISABEL HAD SAID NOTHING ON HER WAY UP
RALPH WENT ON MORE GRAVELY I THINK IT VERY GOOD FOR YOU TO HAVE MEANS ISABEL LOOKED AT HIM WITH SERIOUS EYES I WONDER WHETHER YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME OR WHETHER YOU CARE IF I KNOW DEPEND UPON IT I CARE
CRIED LORD WARBURTON STILL WITH HIS SONOROUS MIRTH MY EXCUSE FOR NOT ROWING IS THAT MY COUSIN ROWS SO WELL SAID RALPH SHE DOES EVERYTHING WELL SHE TOUCHES NOTHING THAT SHE DOESN'T ADORN
NO I'M NOT EASILY CHARMED AND THEN HE STOPPED A MOMENT
SHE WAS LEARNING TO SACRIFICE CONSISTENCY TO CONSIDERATIONS OF THAT INFERIOR ORDER FOR WHICH THE EXCUSE MUST BE FOUND IN THE PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS NOT TO THE CREDIT OF HER ABSOLUTE RECTITUDE
SHE WAS ABSORBED IN THE ALARM GIVEN HER BY HENRIETTA'S INTIMATION THAT CASPAR GOODWOOD WOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT GARDENCOURT SHE PRETENDED TO HERSELF HOWEVER THAT SHE THOUGHT THE EVENT IMPOSSIBLE AND LATER
OH I KNOW HE DOESN'T ROW HE'S TOO LAZY SAID HIS LORDSHIP INDICATING RALPH TOUCHETT WITH A LAUGH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR HIS LAZINESS ISABEL REJOINED LOWERING HER VOICE A LITTLE AH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING
I'M NOT SO IN THE LEAST I PROTEST
AT THE PROSPECT OF LOSING HIS GREAT MOTIVE RALPH LOST INDEED HIS ONE INSPIRATION
HAD THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THINKING ALL THE OTHERS AESTHETIC VULGARIANS
AND THE AGITATIONS OF THE WORLD FOR THIS REASON SHE WAS FOND OF SEEING GREAT CROWDS AND LARGE STRETCHES OF COUNTRY OF READING ABOUT REVOLUTIONS AND WARS OF LOOKING AT HISTORICAL PICTURES A CLASS OF EFFORTS
AND HAD MASTERED THE SOVEREIGN TRUTH THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS GOT FOR NOTHING SHE HAD PLAYED NO SOCIAL PART AS MISTRESS OF GARDENCOURT AND IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY A MINUTE ACCOUNT SHOULD BE KEPT OF HER COMINGS AND GOINGS
IT HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY LIFE AND SHE HAD BEEN A VERY FORTUNATE PERSON
THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN WAS CASPAR GOODWOOD
BUT ISABEL CHALLENGED THIS ASSERTION WITH A GOOD DEAL OF SERIOUSNESS YOU MUST NOT SAY THAT LILY I DON'T FEEL GRAND AT ALL I'M SURE THERE'S NO HARM SAID THE CONCILIATORY LILY
WHEN LORD WARBURTON SHOWED HER THE HOUSE AFTER LUNCHEON IT SEEMED TO HER A MATTER OF COURSE THAT IT SHOULD BE A NOBLE PICTURE WITHIN IT HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL MODERNISED SOME OF ITS BEST POINTS HAD LOST THEIR PURITY
ESPECIALLY THE LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE
I THINK YOU'RE ENCHANTING JUST AS YOU ARE
TO SEE AS MUCH OF THE WORLD AS POSSIBLE AND IT WAS FOR THIS PURPOSE THAT BEFORE ISABEL WAS FOURTEEN HE HAD TRANSPORTED THEM THREE TIMES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC GIVING THEM ON EACH OCCASION HOWEVER BUT A FEW MONTHS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT PROPOSED
SHE HAD THOUGHT IT VERY POSSIBLE HE WOULD COME IN
MISSUS TOUCHETT GAVE A LITTLE LOOK OF DESPAIR AND SAT DOWN AGAIN
POOR RALPH HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS STEEPED IN MELANCHOLY HIS OUTLOOK HABITUALLY SOMBRE LAY UNDER THE SHADOW OF A DEEPER CLOUD
YOU DON'T OF NECESSITY LOSE BY THAT IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU TO SAY SO BUT EVEN IF I GAIN STERN JUSTICE IS NOT WHAT I MOST LOVE IS MISSUS TOUCHETT GOING TO TAKE YOU ABROAD I HOPE SO
IT'S NEVER WRONG TO DO THAT SHE HAD LISTENED EAGERLY AS I SAY AND IT WAS HER NATURE TO UNDERSTAND QUICKLY I WONDER IF YOU APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAY IF YOU DO YOU TAKE A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY YOU FRIGHTEN ME A LITTLE
IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU DESIRE TO TREAT THEM NO WONDER YOU DON'T LIKE AMERICA IF YOU'VE NOT GOOD SERVANTS YOU'RE MISERABLE MISSUS TOUCHETT SERENELY SAID THEY'RE VERY BAD IN AMERICA BUT I'VE FIVE PERFECT ONES IN FLORENCE
I DON'T LIKE MISS STACKPOLE EVERYTHING ABOUT HER DISPLEASES ME SHE TALKS SO MUCH TOO LOUD AND LOOKS AT ONE AS IF ONE WANTED TO LOOK AT HER WHICH ONE DOESN'T
SHE FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO DIFFER FROM HIM ON A VARIETY OF POINTS IN FACT THE QUALITY OF THIS SMALL RIPE COUNTRY SEEMED AS SWEET TO HER AS THE TASTE OF AN OCTOBER PEAR
ISABEL ALWAYS FELT AN IMPULSE TO PULL OUT THE PINS NOT THAT SHE IMAGINED THEY INFLICTED ANY DAMAGE ON THE TOUGH OLD PARCHMENT BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HER HER AUNT MIGHT MAKE BETTER USE OF HER SHARPNESS
TIME ENOUGH TO INSTITUTE A SEARCH FOR A RICH ECCLESIASTICISM AND GIVE IT UP AS VAIN
SEEMED TO HER MORE THAN A NOBLE HUMILITY OR AN ENLIGHTENED PRIDE OUGHT TO WISH TO RECKON WITH SHE HAD SO DEFINITELY UNDERTAKEN TO PRESERVE NO RECORD OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THAT A CORRESPONDING EFFORT ON HIS OWN PART
WHICH IN SPITE OF INCREASING DISTANCE WERE STILL SUFFICIENTLY SALIENT THEY WERE RECOGNISABLE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
AND NOW EVEN AS THEY WHO WERE ON THE OUTWARD EDGE OF THE ARRAY AND COULD SEE WHAT WAS TOWARD WERE LOOKING ON THE BATTLE WITH EAGER EYES THERE CAME AN ANSWERING SHOUT DOWN THE WIND WHICH THEY KNEW FOR THE VOICE OF THE GOTHS AMID THE FOEMEN
AND THAT THEY WERE OVER BIG FOR HIM TO MEDDLE WITH TRUE IT IS ALSO THAT NOW DARK NIGHT WAS COMING ON AND THE LAND WAS UNKNOWN TO THE ROMANS WHO MOREOVER TRUSTED NOT WHOLLY TO THE DASTARDS OF THE GOTHS WHO WERE THEIR GUIDES AND SCOUTS
BELIKE IT WERE BETTER TO LEAVE THE HALL AND LET THE WOOD COVER US
AND SLEW SOME AND DRAVE SOME INTO THE DEEPS AND TROUBLED THE WHOLE ROMAN HOST SO NOW THE ROMAN CAPTAIN WAS FORCED TO TAKE NEW ORDER AND GATHER ALL HIS MEN TOGETHER AND ARRAY HIS MEN FOR A HARD FIGHT
BUT FOR THE ROMANS THEY WERE INDEED GETTING READY TO CROSS THE FORD WHEN THE MIST SHOULD HAVE RISEN AND ON THE BANK IT WAS THINNING ALREADY AND MELTING AWAY
AND IF YE BE TAKEN AND IT SEEM TO YOU THAT YE MAY NOT BEAR THE SMART OF THE ROMAN TORMENTS FOR THEY BE WISE IN TORMENTING BUT WILL SPEAK AND BEWRAY US UNDER THEM THEN THRUST THIS LITTLE EDGE TOOL INTO THE PLACE OF YOUR BODIES
BECAUSE WE BEAR THE MESSAGE THAT THE BATTLE ROAD YE TAKE NOR TARRY FOR THE THUNDER OR THE COMING ON OF RAIN OR THE WINDY CLOUDY NIGHT TIDE LEST YOUR BATTLE BE BUT VAIN
ANOTHER REACHED TO HER THE MEAD HORN AND SHE HAD SCARCE DONE HER DRAUGHT ERE OTTER WAS THERE FOR THEY HAD FOUND HIM AT THE GATE OF THE BURG HE HAD MANY A TIME BEEN IN THE WOLFING HALL SO HE KNEW HER AT ONCE AND SAID
BEFORE THEY COULD BE MET IN BATTLE AGAIN FOR AS AFORESAID THEY WERE EAGER FOR THE FRAY NOW IT WAS IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING TWO DAYS AFTER THE BATTLE ON THE RIDGE
THROUGH THE BRAKE TO THE SOUTH AND TWELVE MEN CAME SLOWLY AND WARILY INTO THAT OAK LAWN AND LO ONE OF THEM WAS FOX
AS IF HE WERE STRUGGLING WITH A WEIGHT HARD TO LIFT THEN SAID OTTER
WHEREIN JAVELINS AND SPEARS CAST BY THE HAND WERE MINGLED WITH THE ARROWS BUT THE ROMAN RANKS HAD FACED THE MEADOW AND THE STORM WHICH IT YIELDED SWIFTLY AND STEADILY
HER FACE WAS PALE NOW HER LIPS A LITTLE OPEN HER EYES SET AND STARING AS IF THEY SAW NOTHING OF ALL THAT WAS ROUND ABOUT HER
SCARCE A HILL EVEN NOUGHT BUT A GENTLE SWELLING OF THE EARTH THEY FOREBORE THEM AND RAISING UP THE WHOOP OF VICTORY DREW SLOWLY ABACK PICKING UP THEIR OWN DEAD AND WOUNDED AND SLAYING THE WOUNDED MARKMEN
AS THE ROMAN CAPTAIN KNEW SO THEY STOOD AWHILE MAKING GRIM COUNTENANCE AND THEN SLOWLY DREW BACK
BUT NOT SO MIGHTY THAT IT MAY NOT BE MET FEW WORDS ARE BEST LET THE STEERINGS WHO ARE NOT MANY BUT ARE MEN WELL TRIED IN WAR AND WISDOM ABIDE IN THE BURG ALONG WITH THE FIGHTING THRALLS
THERE THE MORNING BEFORE HE THOUGHT THAT THE ROOF WAS HELD BY WARRIORS OF THE KINDREDS AND NOT BY A FEW OLD MEN AND WOMEN AND LADS THEREFORE HE HAD NO FEAR OF THEIR ESCAPING HIM
BUT HER COUNTENANCE WHICH HAD NOT CHANGED DURING HER SONG CHANGED NOT AT ALL NOW SO THEY ALL KEPT SILENCE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE REJOICING IN THIS NEW TALE OF VICTORY FOR THEY DEEMED THAT SHE WAS NOT YET AT THE END OF HER SPEAKING
BUT TURNED HIS HORSE AND RODE DOWN TO THE FORD AND ALL MEN FOLLOWED HIM AND OF THE BEARINGS THERE WERE AN HUNDRED WARRIORS SAVE ONE AND OF THE WORMINGS EIGHTY AND SEVEN
AND FAIR THE GOTH FOLK GROWETH AND YET THE STORY SAITH THAT THE DEEDS THAT MAKE THE SUMMER MAKE TOO THE WINTER'S DEATH THAT SUMMER TIDES UNCEASING FROM OUT THE GRAVE MAY GROW
WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE WATCH MUCH FURTHER OFF AND HAD SPOKEN WITH THE FURTHEST OF ALL WHICH ONE HAD SEEN THE FARING OF THE ROMAN HOST AND THAT IT WAS VERY GREAT AND NO MERE BAND OF PILLAGERS OR OF SCOUTS
AND BLIND I COME ABACK TO THE HOUSE ROOF OF THE WOLFINGS AND THE HEARTH THAT HATH NO LACK HER VOICE GREW WEAKER AS SHE SPAKE THE LAST WORDS AND SHE SANK BACKWARD ON TO HER CHAIR
AND THEN THEY SAW HOW THE RING OF THE ROMANS SHOOK AND PARTED AND THEIR ARRAY FELL BACK AND LO THE COMPANY OF THE MARKMEN STANDING STOUTLY TOGETHER THOUGH SORELY MINISHED AND SURE IT WAS THAT THEY HAD NOT FLED OR BEEN SCATTERED
AND WAS BLITHE WITH ALL BOTH OLD AND YOUNG BUT AS THEY WERE AT THE POINT OF GOING SHE CALLED TO THEM AND SAID TARRY A LITTLE COME YE ALL TO THE DAIS AND HEARKEN TO ME
IT BEARS THE STORMY DRIFT NOR BOWS TO THE LIGHTENING FLASHING ADOWN FROM THE CLOUDY LIFT I SEE THE HAIL OF BATTLE AND THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE STRONG AND THEY GO ADOWN TO THE FOLK MOTE
TILL THE JOY OF OUR HEARTS IN BATTLE BRING BACK THE DAY AGAIN AS HE SPAKE THAT WORD
AS NOW AT LAST IT COMETH WHEN E E N IN SUCH LIKE TIDE FOR THE FREEING OF MY TROUBLE O'ER THE FATHERS FIELD I RIDE MANY MEN PERCEIVED THAT HE SANG
THEY BICKER ABOUT THE FORD IN THE GREY OF THE MORNING WAS OTTER AFOOT WITH THE WATCHERS AND PRESENTLY HE GOT ON HIS HORSE AND PEERED OVER THE PLAIN BUT THE MIST YET HUNG LOW ON IT
AND IF WE RIDE WITH THEM IT MAY BE THAT WE SHALL OVERTHROW THE ROMANS AND IF WE BE VANQUISHED IT SHALL GO HARD BUT WE SHALL SLAY MANY OF THEM
SO THEY RODE BACK TO WHERE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FOLK TALKING WITH THEM OF OTTER AND THE BEARINGS WERE SITTING GRIM UPON THEIR HORSES AND SOMEWHAT SCOWLING ON OTTER'S MEN
NOT OUT OF EARSHOT OF A MAN SPEAKING IN HIS WONTED VOICE OUR WAR DUKE MADE A SIGN TO THOSE ABOUT HIM AND WE SPREAD VERY QUIETLY TO THE RIGHT HAND AND THE LEFT OF HIM ONCE MORE AND WE DREW AS CLOSE AS MIGHT BE TO THE THICKET'S EDGE
AND WE SAW NOUGHT SAVE HERE AND THERE A ROE AND HERE AND THERE A SOUNDER OF SWINE AND CONEYS WHERE IT WAS OPENER AND THE SUN SHONE AND THE GRASS GREW FOR A LITTLE SPACE
COME YE SONS OF THE BEAR YE CHILDREN OF THE WORM
WHERE WERE THE BONES OF THY MOTHER LYING SAID SWEINBIORN WE SOUGHT THE FEAST HALL OVER AND NOUGHT WE FOUND THEREIN OF THE BONES OF THE ANCIENT MOTHERS OR THE YOUNGLINGS OF THE KIN
TELL HER I WILL CAST THE DICE FOR LIFE OR DEATH
NOW FOR YOUR TIDINGS FELLOWS SAID GEIRBALD OUR TIDINGS ARE THAT BOTH OUR ERRANDS ARE PREVENTED AND COME TO NOUGHT FOR OTTER HATH NOT TARRIED BUT HATH RIDDEN WITH ALL HIS FOLK TOWARD THE STEAD OF THINE HOUSE
MAN LOOKED ASKANCE AT MAN AS IF IN SHAME TO BE LEFT BEHIND BUT OTTER BETHOUGHT HIM IN THE FLASH OF A MOMENT IF THESE MEN RIDE ALONE THEY SHALL DIE AND DO NOTHING
AND WITH AS LITTLE NOISE AS MIGHT BE SO DID THEY AND THERE WAS LITTLE DELAY FOR MEN WERE SLEEPING WITH ONE EYE OPEN AS FOLK SAY AND MANY WERE ALREADY ASTIR
BUT THEY FOR THEIR PART MIGHT NOT FOLLOW AFOOT MEN ON UNTIRED HORSES AND THEIR OWN HORSE WAS ON THE WEST SIDE WITH THE BAGGAGE
IT WAS A LAD OF FIFTEEN WINTERS NAKED SAVE HIS BREECHES AND WET FROM THE RIVER AND OTTER DREW REIN AND THE LAD SAID TO HIM ART THOU THE WAR DUKE
BUT EACH MAN WENT ABOUT HIS BUSINESS OF LOOKING TO HIS WAR GEAR AND GATHERING TO THE APPOINTED PLACE OF HIS KINDRED
THAT IT MIGHT BE BETTER FOR US TO FALL ON THESE ROMANS AT ONCE BEFORE THEY HAVE CAST UP A DIKE ABOUT THEM AS FOX TELLETH IS THEIR WONT AND THAT EVEN IN AN HOUR THEY MAY DO MUCH
YET SHALL NOT TYR MAKE US NEW ONES OUT OF THE STONES OF THE WASTE TO WED WITH THE GALTINGS AND THE FISH EATING HOUSES THIS IS EASY TO BE DONE FORSOOTH YEA EASIER THAN FIGHTING THE ROMANS AND OVERCOMING THEM
LET US HASTEN WHILE THE GODS WILL HAVE IT SO AND WHILE THEY ARE STILL SUFFERING ME TO STRIKE A STROKE FOR THE KINDRED AND THEREWITH HE BRANDISHED THRONG PLOUGH AND WENT FORTH TOWARD THE BATTLE AND THE HEART GREW HOT WITHIN HIM
AND IN THE SOUTHLAND CITIES THE YOKE OF SLAVES YE BEAR LO YE WHOEVER FOLLOWS I FARE TO SOW THE SEED OF THE DAYS TO BE HEREAFTER AND THE DEED THAT COMES OF DEED THEREWITH
WAS CLOSE AT HAND SO HE BADE HIM BLOW THE WAR BLAST AND ALL MEN KNEW THE MEANING OF THAT VOICE OF THE HORN AND EVERY MAN ARMED HIM IN HASTE AND THEY WHO HAD HORSES AND THESE WERE BUT THE BEARINGS AND THE WARNINGS SADDLED THEM AND MOUNTED
AND TO BARE PLACES WHERE THE ROCKS CROP UP THROUGH THE GRAVEL AND THE WOODLAND LOAM THERE BREED THE CONEYS WITHOUT NUMBER AND WILD CATS HAUNT THE PLACE FOR THAT SAKE AND FOXES
THAT WHEN KING HASAN WAS QUIT OF THE DIVAN
A PLENTEOUS GETTER OF BROOD BY WHOM THE FEMALES ABUNDANTLY BORE
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SECOND NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE PRINCE SET THEM ASHORE AND THEY SEARCHED THE ISLAND EAST AND WEST BUT FOUND NO ONE
AND HE CEASED NOT FOLLOWING THEM TO THE PLACE OF EXECUTION TILL HE CAME UP WITH THEM AND SAID TO THEM HASTEN NOT TO STONE HER TILL I JUDGE BETWEEN THEM
WITH GREAT STORE OF BRIDAL GEAR AND I HAVE APPOINTED HIM TO STAND IN MY STEAD AND TO ENTER INTO THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT IN MY NAME FURTHERMORE I DESIRE THAT OF THY FAVOUR THOU WILT GRANT HIM HIS REQUEST
AND THEIR GOING WAS LIKE THE BLINDING LIGHTNING SO HE STATIONED HIMSELF IN THEIR ROAD AND WHEN THEY CAME UP TO HIM HE SALUTED THEM AND SAID TO THEM I ASK YOU BY THE ALMIGHTY THE GLORIOUS TO TELL ME YOUR NAMES AND WHITHER ARE YE BOUND
AND SWAYING TO AND FRO WITH A SWING LIKE A LION READY FOR A SPRING HE CAST THE STONE AT MY STALLION AND IT KILLED HIM FOR IT STRUCK A VITAL PART WHEN I SAW THE STALLION DROP DEAD BESIDE ME
ALL SAVE A SMALL PARTY WHICH REMAINED IN PRESENCE TO SERVE HIM AFTER AWHILE THERE CAME UP A COMPANY OF APES WITH HUGE DOGS IN THE SEMBLANCE OF HORSES EACH WEARING ABOUT HIS HEAD A MASSIVE CHAIN
AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDREDTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING
AND HIS CHEEKS WERE RED AND FLOWER WHITE WAS HIS FOREHEAD AND HIS SIDE FACE WAXED BROWN WITH TENDER DOWN EVEN AS SAITH ONE DESCRIBING HIM THE SPRING OF THE DOWN ON CHEEKS RIGHT CLEARLY SHOWS
AND SAID TO HIM MAY NO ILL BEFAL THEE AT THIS THE OLD KING OPENED HIS EYES AND SAID
WAS SITTING ONE DAY JUDGING THE FOLK AND DOING JUSTICE BETWEEN HIS SUBJECTS ATTENDED BY THE BEST AND WISEST OF HIS COUNSELLORS WHEN THERE CAME UP TO HIM A YOUTH COMELY AND CLEANLY ATTIRED UPON WHOM TWO VERY HANDSOME YOUTHS HAD LAID HOLD
AND FARED ON FROM PLACE TO PLACE TILL THEY APPROACHED THE WADY OF EMMETS
AND HE WAS SUZERAIN ALSO OVER SEVEN VASSAL PRINCES AND TRIBUTE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM FROM THE BROAD LANDS BETWEEN EAST AND WEST HE WAS JUST AND EQUITABLE IN HIS RULE
HERE THE SERPENT QUEEN AGAIN BROKE OFF HER RECITAL SAYING
THAT HE WHO WROTE THIS TABLET WAS THE LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
AFTER WHICH THEY SAID TO HIM KNOW O KING THAT THOU SHALT BE BLESSED WITH A SON
SO HE LANDED AND ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE PALACE WHICH HE ENTERED MARVELLING AT THE GOODLINESS OF THE PLACE THEY THEN VISITED EVERY PART OF THE GARDENS AND ATE OF THE FRUITS AND CONTINUED WALKING TILL IT WAXED DARK
AND ALL HIS DAYS WERE GLADNESS MOREOVER HIS FATHER CEASED NOT TO BE HIS CHIEF WAZIR ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND HE TOOK TO HIMSELF ANOTHER WAZIR TO BE AT HIS LEFT HAND HIS REIGN WAS A PROSPEROUS AND WELL ORDERED
WHAT IS THE MATTER OF WHICH THOU WOULDST TAKE COUNSEL WITH US O KING AND HE ANSWERED I AM OLD AND SICKLY AND I FEAR FOR THE REALM AFTER ME FROM ITS ENEMIES
RISE COME WITH US TO THE KING WHEREFORE ASKED HE AND THEY ANSWERED FOR A THING THAT WILL BENEFIT BOTH US AND THEE SO HE WENT IN WITH THEM TO THE KING AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE HIS FATHER IN LAW WHO SAID TO HIM
THAT E E N BY DAY LIGHT SHOWS THE DUNG UPON THEIR DRESS WHAT CONTRAST WI THE MAN WHO SLEPT A GLADSOME NIGHT
WHEN IT WAS THE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOURTH NIGHT SHE SAID
HE IS CONSOLED AND LIE NO CONSOLATION COMES TO THOSE WHO PINE AND SIGH I HAD NO SOLACE WHEN ROSE BLOOMED ALONE ON CHEEK
I WILL APPOINT SOME GUARDIAN TO ADMINISTER THE AFFAIRS OF THE BOY AND RETURN TO ANSWER MY DEBT AND I HAVE ONE WHO WILL BE MY SURETY FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS MY PROMISE SO THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL BOWED HIS HEAD AWHILE
WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY FOR IT IS MY OWN AND ALL GRACIOUSNESS THOU SHOWEST HIM I TAKE FOR MYSELF BUT BEWARE OF CROSSING ME IN THIS FOR KNOW O KING BAHRWAN
WITH LIGHT SHINING FROM HIS VISAGE SITTING WEEPING AND LAMENTING BETWEEN TWO BUILT TOMBS SO HE SALUTED HIM AND HE RETURNED HIS SALUTATION AND BULUKIYA SAID TO HIM WHO ART THOU
FURTHERMORE ALLAH HAD BLESSED HIM WITH A SON OF PERFECT BEAUTY AND BRILLIANCY ROSY CHEEKED FAIR OF FACE AND WELL FIGURED WHOM HE NAMED ALI OF CAIRO AND HAD TAUGHT THE KORAN AND SCIENCE
AND PLEASAUNCES MADE AND WEALTH HEAPED UP AND SMITTEN OFF IS MANY A HEAD AND INDEED HE SPOKE SOOTH IN THE WORDS WHOSO SAITH THE WORLD MEANETH WOMAN NOW AS FOR THY CITATION FROM THE HOLY TRADITIONS
QUOTH SHE ALLAH WILL PRESERVE ME FROM YOUR FROWARDNESS THEN THEY OPENED THE GARDEN GATE AND CRIED OUT AND THE FOLK CAME TO THEM FROM ALL PLACES SAYING WHAT AILETH YOU QUOTH THEY
COMPARETH THE BEARDLESS WITH THE BLACK EYED GIRLS OF PARADISE NOW DOUBTLESS THE SUBJECT OF COMPARISON IS WORTHIER THAN THE OBJECT THERE WITH COMPARED SO UNLESS WOMEN BE THE WORTHIER AND THE GOODLIER
SO THAT THOU HAST NOW THREE THOUSAND THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DIRHAMS WHEREWITHAL TO ORDER AND AMEND THINE ESTATE SEE THEN THE MUNIFICENCE OF THESE MAGNIFICOS
WHEREFORE GAINSAY THOU NOT THE KING'S COMMANDMENT AND THAT OF THY BRETHREN AND HASAN HUNG HIS HEAD ABASHED BEFORE THE KING AND HIS FATHER THEN SAID THE KING TO THE EMIRS
TWO OLD MEN ITS KEEPERS AND BOTH SHAYKHS FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AND SOUGHT HER FAVOURS BUT SHE REFUSED WHEREUPON SAID THEY UNLESS THOU YIELD THY BODY TO US WE WILL BEAR WITNESS AGAINST THEE OF FORNICATION
AND KING HASAN REPLIED I HEAR AND OBEY NOW AFTER THIS THE OLD KING LINGERED THREE DAYS AND THEN DEPARTED INTO THE MERCY OF ALMIGHTY ALLAH SO THEY LAID HIM OUT
WHAT HAST THOU IN REPLY TO AVER BUT HE WAS BRAVE OF HEART AND BOLD OF SPEECH HAVING DOFFED THE ROBE OF PUSILLANIMITY AND PUT OFF THE GARB OF COWARDRY SO HE SMILED
SHE HATH LIPS LIKE WINE AND BREASTS LIKE POMEGRANATES TWAIN AND A SHAPE SUPPLE AS A RATTAN CANE HER BODY IS WELL FORMED AND WITH SLOPING SHOULDERS DIGHT SHE HATH A NOSE LIKE THE EDGE OF A SWORD SHINING BRIGHT
THAT WHEN THE PREACHER WOMAN ENDED HER VERSE SHE RESUMED ADDRESSING THE MAN LAUD TO ALLAH ALMIGHTY HOW CAN IT BE HID FROM THEE THAT THE PERFECT PLEASURE IS IN WOMEN AND THAT ABIDING BLESSINGS ARE NOT TO BE FOUND BUT WITH THEM
JANSHAH AND HIS MEN CEASED NOT DRIVING BEFORE THE WIND AND THOSE IN SEARCH OF THEM CRUISED ABOUT FOR TEN DAYS
IN HER ALL BEAUTIES TO CONCLUSION COME AND SHE IS THE CENTRE OF ATTRACTION TO TRAVELLER AND STAY AT HOME SHE HATH TWO LIPS OF CRAMOISY THAN CREAM SMOOTHER AND OF TASTE THAN HONEY SWEETER
ACQUIT ME THEREFORE OF THIS THING BUT ALL THE EMIRS CRIED OUT SAYING WE CONSENT NOT BUT THAT THOU BE KING OVER US THEN SAID HASAN MY FATHER IS OLDER THAN I AND I AND HE ARE ONE THING
HASAN FELL SICK AND HIS SICKNESS GREW UPON HIM TILL HE MADE SURE OF DEATH SO HE CALLED HIS SON TO HIM
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FOURTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT JANSHAH READ THIS MUCH UPON THE TABLET
THIS IS A THING WHICH MAY NOT BE NOR WILL I BELIEVE THEE UPON THINE OATH WHEN HE HEARD THIS HE WEPT AND ALL THE SERPENTS WEPT ON HIS ACCOUNT AND TOOK TO INTERCEDING FOR HIM WITH THEIR QUEEN SAYING
QUOTH I NAY BY MY LIFE OF HIM'S SHAYBAN HOW MANY A SIRE ROSE HIGH BY A NOBLE SON AS ALLAH'S PROPHET
FOR WHATSO HE WILLETH THAT HE CAN AND HE IS GRACIOUS WITH HIS SERVANTS AND KNOWETH THEIR WANTS SO I WENT OUT FROM THE TWAIN AND RETURNED TO ABDALLAH WITH STRAITENED BREAST
SO WE WENT OUR WAY REJOICING IN THAT WE HAD PROFITED BY HER CONTENTION AND YET SORROWING TO PART FROM HER AND AMONG THE TALES THEY TELL IS ONE OF ABU SUWAYD AND THE PRETTY OLD WOMAN
AND I WOULD HAVE THEE ABIDE WITH ME TILL I TELL THEE MY HISTORY AND ACQUAINT THEE HOW I COME TO BE SITTING HERE HEARING THIS MUCH HASIB AGAIN INTERRUPTED THE QUEEN OF THE SERPENTS AND SAID TO HER
BUT DON'T MIND IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER OR WOULD RATHER NOT WHAT ELSE DID I SAY QUEER WHAT STUFF A MAN WILL TALK WHEN HIS WITS ARE GONE THAT'S ALL I HEARD BUT IT SEEMED INTERESTING AND I JUST MENTIONED IT THINKING IT MIGHT REFRESH YOUR MEMORY A BIT
AND BY AND BY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK INNOCENT GIRLS TO LOVE YOU YES'M THANK YOU I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT BUT IT'S PRETTY HARD WORK TO TOE THE MARK WHEN LADIES GIVE YOU WINE AND GENTLEMEN TAKE THEIR DAUGHTERS TO SEE AIMEE SAID DOLLY
AND WITH A DELICATE HANDKERCHIEF NEGLIGENTLY DROOPING AT THE PROPER ANGLE HAD A TRULY FINE EFFECT BOOTS THAT SHONE AND LIKEWISE PINCHED APPEARED AT ONE END OF THE LONG BLACK CLOTHES PIN' AS JOSIE CALLED HIM
AS THE GREAT BERGMANN SELDOM PRAISED HIS PUPILS THESE WORDS FILLED NAT'S SOUL WITH PRIDE AND JOY AND HE WORKED YET MORE DILIGENTLY THAN BEFORE TO FULFIL HIS MASTER'S PROPHECY HE THOUGHT THE TRIP TO ENGLAND HAPPINESS ENOUGH BUT FOUND ROOM FOR MORE WHEN EARLY IN JUNE
FEELING MORE LIKE A TRAITOR THAN EVER SHE EXPECTED AN EXPLOSION BUT DAN TOOK THE NEWS SO QUIETLY IT WAS PLAIN THAT HE CHERISHED NO HOPE AND MISSUS AMY WAS SURE HER ROMANTIC SISTER HAD BEEN MISTAKEN IF SHE HAD SEEN DAN'S FACE
BECAUSE I'M YOUR PAL AND CARE FOR YOU NO END ALWAYS DID COME NOW TELL ME A GOOD YARN I LOVE SCRAPES I'LL BE MUM AS AN OYSTER IF YOU DON'T WANT IT KNOWN WILL YOU AND DAN LOOKED AT HIM
DRAMATIC SITUATIONS AND FEMININE WONDER AS TO WHETHER THE LOVELY CREATURES WOULD WEAR THEIR VEILS OR NOT SHE WAS STANDING BEFORE A GREAT BUSH OF WHITE ROSES
AND THE LIGHT AS SHE PLAYED MAID AT THE TOILETTES OF OUR BRIDES WHICH CONSOLED HER FOR A DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE MATTER OF VEILS NO ONE HELPED ALICE DRESS FOR DAISY WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM WITH HER MOTHER
AND BE COMFORTED ANSWERED MISSUS AMY GLAD TO BE AT HOME AND FIND NO WOLVES PROWLING NEAR HER SHEEPFOLD I'VE BEEN SO WORRIED LATELY I CAN'T HELP CROAKING I WONDER WHAT DAN THOUGHT AT NOT SEEING YOU AGAIN
THINGS LOOKED DARK AND HOPE BEGAN TO FAIL THE WOUNDED MAN WAS DELIRIOUS THE WIFE WORN OUT WITH ANXIETY AND SUSPENSE THE GIRL WEAK FOR WANT OF FOOD HAVING PUT AWAY HALF HER BISCUIT FOR HER MOTHER AND GIVEN HER SHARE OF WATER TO WET HER FATHER'S FEVERISH LIPS
WHO BLAIR AND MASON ARE AND WHO WAS HIT AND WHO RAN AWAY AND ALL THE REST OF IT WHAT CRIED DAN IN A TONE THAT MADE TED JUMP WELL YOU USED TO MUTTER ABOUT EM IN YOUR SLEEP AND UNCLE LAURIE WONDERED SO DID I
BOTH YOU GET THE ONE AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE OTHER WISH I COULD AND DEMI PICKED A LITTLE BUD WITH A SIGH THAT WENT TO JOSIE'S WARM HEART WHY DON'T YOU THEN IT'S LOVELY TO SEE PEOPLE SO HAPPY
AND FROST PINCHED THE TOES THAT PATIENTLY TRUDGED IN OLD BOOTS NO DEBTS BURDENED HIM THE YEAR OF ABSENCE WAS NEARLY OVER AND IF HE CHOSE TO STAY HERR BERGMANN HAD HOPES FOR HIM THAT WOULD BRING INDEPENDENCE FOR A TIME AT LEAST
IT WAS NOT THE PHYSICAL HARDSHIP THAT DAUNTED HIM THOUGH WANT AND WEAKNESS TORTURED HIM IT WAS HIS DREADFUL POWERLESSNESS TO CONQUER THE CRUEL FATE THAT SEEMED HANGING OVER THEM THE MEN HE CARED LITTLE FOR
IS THIS LIKELY TO BE A GALE THINK YE ADDED MISSUS HARDY WITH AN ANXIOUS GLANCE AT THE WEST WHERE THE SUN WAS SETTING REDLY ONLY A CAPFUL OF WIND MA'AM JUST ENOUGH TO SEND US ALONG LIVELY ANSWERED EMIL
FRANZ KEPT THE CABLE BUSY WITH HIS VARYING MESSAGES NAT SENT LOVING LETTERS FROM LEIPZIG AND TOM HARASSED THE SHIPPING AGENTS FOR NEWS EVEN BUSY JACK WROTE THEM WITH UNUSUAL WARMTH
SAID PROFESSOR BHAER COMING IN ONE DAY EARLY IN JANUARY PLEASE TELL IT AT ONCE I CAN'T BEAR TO WAIT FRITZ CRIED MISSUS JO DROPPING HER WORK AND STANDING UP AS IF TO TAKE THE SHOT BRAVELY BUT WE MUST WAIT AND HOPE HEART'S DEAREST COME
FORESEEING TRIBULATIONS AHEAD THOUGH HE KNEW IT WAS TIME TO PULL UP SO IT IS
EMIL DID HIS BEST BUT MORTAL MAN WAS HELPLESS THERE AND HE COULD ONLY TURN HIS HAGGARD FACE FROM THE PITILESS SKY THAT DROPPED NO RAIN FOR THEIR THIRST TO THE BOUNDLESS SEA WHERE NO SAIL APPEARED TO GLADDEN THEIR LONGING EYES
AND MISSUS MEG WAS GETTING ANXIOUS WHEN MISS CAMERON SENT JOSIE A KIND NOTE
ALL DAY HE TRIED TO CHEER AND COMFORT THEM WHILE HUNGER GNAWED THIRST PARCHED AND GROWING FEAR LAY HEAVY AT HIS HEART HE TOLD STORIES TO THE MEN IMPLORED THEM TO BEAR UP FOR THE HELPLESS WOMEN'S SAKE AND PROMISED REWARDS
WHEN BOOKS PICTURES BALL ROOMS THEATRES AND STREETS OFFER TEMPTATIONS YET YOU CAN RESIST IF YOU TRY LAST WINTER MISSUS BROOKE USED TO WORRY ABOUT JOHN'S BEING OUT SO LATE REPORTING
THERE WAS GREAT SCRUBBING AND DUSTING AMONG THE MATRONS AS THEY SET THEIR HOUSES IN ORDER NOT ONLY FOR CLASS DAY BUT TO RECEIVE THE BRIDE AND GROOM WHO WERE TO COME TO THEM FOR THE HONEYMOON TRIP GREAT PLANS WERE MADE GIFTS PREPARED AND MUCH JOY FELT AT THE PROSPECT OF SEEING FRANZ AGAIN
AND PATIENT DAISY A HAPPY GIRL AT LAST NAT IS YOUR WORK FRITZ AND I CONGRATULATE YOU HEARTILY
LEFT THE WATCH TO THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY SAILOR THAT HE MIGHT SNATCH AN HOUR'S REST THESE TWO MEN GOT AT THE STORES AND STOLE THE LAST OF THE BREAD AND WATER AND THE ONE BOTTLE OF BRANDY WHICH WAS CAREFULLY HOARDED TO KEEP UP THEIR STRENGTH AND MAKE THE BRACKISH WATER DRINKABLE
NOT FOND OF BOOKS THEREFORE WITHOUT THE SAFEGUARD WHICH KEEPS MANY STUDIOUS FELLOWS OUT OF HARM ONE SELF INDULGENT INDOLENT AND SO USED TO LUXURY THAT PAMPERING OF THE SENSES WAS AN EASY THING THE OTHER VAIN AS ALL COMELY BOYS ARE
YOU WILL MARRY A COOK AND KEEP A RESTAURANT SOME DAY LAUGHED JOSIE DOWN ON HIM AT ONCE THIS FEARFUL PREDICTION KEPT HIM SILENT FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS BUT DOLLY RALLIED AND WISELY CHANGING THE SUBJECT CARRIED WAR INTO THE ENEMY'S CAMP
AS SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH A FACE FULL OF FRANK AFFECTION AND SWEET REGRET ALL THAT HE WAS LOSING ROSE SO VIVIDLY BEFORE HIM THAT DAN COULD NOT RESIST THE IMPULSE TO TAKE THE DEAR GOLDY HEAD BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND KISS IT WITH A BROKEN
WHAT SHALL I DO SIGHED JOSIE PUSHING BACK THE GREAT RED HAT SHE WORE AND GAZING SADLY ROUND HER FOR MORE WORLDS TO CONQUER I'LL PLAY PRESENTLY WHEN I'M A LITTLE COOLER BUT IT IS DULL WORK FOR ME AS I NEVER WIN ANSWERED BESS
AS YOU WANTED US TO IMPROVE YOUR MANNERS ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT YOUNG LADIES IN GOOD SOCIETY DON'T MAKE PERSONAL REMARKS OR DELIVER LECTURES LITTLE GIRLS WHO ARE NOT OUT DO IT AND THINK IT WITTY BUT I ASSURE YOU IT'S NOT GOOD FORM
OWN FACE WHICH SIGN OF CONFUSION DELIGHTED LITTLE JO DON'T BE A HYPOCRITE YOU KNOW I MEAN ALICE NOW JACK I'M FOND OF YOU AND WANT TO HELP IT'S SO INTERESTING ALL THESE LOVERS AND WEDDINGS AND THINGS
DON'T HURRY I BEG STAY AND REST YOU MUST NEED IT AFTER THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BRAIN WORK YOU'VE DONE THIS WEEK IT IS TIME FOR OUR GREEK COME BESS GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLEMEN
TELLING THE DREADFUL TRUTH TOO PLAINLY FOR ANYONE TO HIDE MISSUS HARDY AND MARY BORE THE SHOCK BRAVELY WHEN TOLD TO BE READY TO QUIT THE SHIP AT A MINUTE'S NOTICE THE BOATS WERE HASTILY PREPARED
BUT TILL LATELY THEY SEEMED NOT TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF HER FRIENDLY HINTS NOW SHE WAS SURE THEY WOULD AND MEANT TO SPEAK OUT FOR LONG EXPERIENCE WITH BOYS MADE HER BOTH BOLD AND SKILFUL IN HANDLING SOME OF THE DANGERS USUALLY LEFT TO SILENCE
AS SHE SAT LOOKING SADLY DOWN ON THE SYMBOLS OF AN AFFECTION THAT GREW DEARER EVERY MOMENT SHE LISTENED HALF UNCONSCIOUSLY TO THE MURMUR OF VOICES IN THE ADJOINING ROOM OPEN WINDOWS THIN PARTITIONS
GIVING AN EYE TO SPREADS AND DIRECTING THE DECORATIONS MISSUS JO HAD HER HANDS FULL AS PRESIDENT'S LADY AND THE MOTHER OF TED FOR IT TOOK ALL THE POWER AND SKILL OF THAT ENERGETIC WOMAN
DEMI BECAME A PARTNER AND LIVED TO SEE HIS NAME ABOVE THE DOOR AND ROB WAS A PROFESSOR AT LAURENCE COLLEGE BUT TEDDY ECLIPSED THEM ALL BY BECOMING AN ELOQUENT AND FAMOUS CLERGYMAN TO THE GREAT DELIGHT OF HIS ASTONISHED MOTHER
HAVE A GAY OLD TIME AND BE A HOWLING SWELL IF I CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU AND ME THOUGH
SO TED FOUND ONE RAY OF JOY TO LIGHT HIS GLOOM
HE HAS HAD A GREAT TROUBLE AND IT MAKES HIM TENDER AT PARTING WITH OLD FRIENDS
HIS TASK MIGHT BE A TERRIBLE ONE SO HE CLUTCHED HIS COURAGE WITH BOTH HANDS KEPT UP A MANLY FRONT AND SPOKE SO CHEERILY OF THEIR GOOD CHANCES THAT ALL INSTINCTIVELY TURNED TO HIM FOR GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT
MY CHILD YOU ARE ABSURD ENOUGH NOW IF I LET YOU ADD A TALL HAT PLUMFIELD WOULDN'T HOLD EITHER OF US SUCH WOULD BE THE SCORN AND DERISION OF ALL BEHOLDERS
ESPECIALLY THE VERY YOUNG ONES JOSIE TOOK IMMENSE SATISFACTION IN THAT RETURN SHOT AND DOLLY SHOWED THAT HE WAS HIT BY THE NETTLED TONE IN WHICH HE ANSWERED
SHALL I EXCHANGE FOR YOU THIS BEAUTIFUL CONTEXTURE OF THINGS TIS THE CONDITION OF YOUR CREATION DEATH IS A PART OF YOU AND WHILST YOU ENDEAVOUR TO EVADE IT YOU EVADE YOURSELVES
THERE ARE SEVERAL FROM WHICH ONE MAY DESCEND WITHOUT FALLING DOWN IT DOES INDEED APPEAR TO ME THAT WE VALUE IT AT TOO HIGH A RATE
AND YET THERE IS NO JOURNEY BUT HATH ITS END AND IF COMPANY WILL MAKE IT MORE PLEASANT OR MORE EASY TO YOU DOES NOT ALL THE WORLD GO THE SELF SAME WAY
THE SECOND OR THIRD IN PERIGORD THAN THE FIRST AT PARIS AT LEAST WITHOUT LYING RATHER THE THIRD AT PARIS THAN THE FIRST
TIS NO LITTLE SATISFACTION TO FEEL A MAN'S SELF PRESERVED FROM THE CONTAGION OF SO DEPRAVED AN AGE AND TO SAY TO HIMSELF WHOEVER COULD PENETRATE INTO MY SOUL WOULD NOT THERE FIND ME GUILTY
THE WISE STOIC LEARNEDLY AND PLAINLY EXPRESSED MENS IMMOTA MANET
SURPRISING THEM AT UNAWARES AND UNPREPARED THEN WHAT TORMENT WHAT OUTCRIES WHAT MADNESS AND DESPAIR DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING SO SUBDUED SO CHANGED AND SO CONFOUNDED A MAN MUST THEREFORE MAKE MORE EARLY PROVISION FOR IT
SO IT IS MY CUSTOM TO HAVE DEATH NOT ONLY IN MY IMAGINATION BUT CONTINUALLY IN MY MOUTH NEITHER IS THERE ANYTHING OF WHICH I AM SO INQUISITIVE AND DELIGHT TO INFORM MYSELF AS THE MANNER OF MEN'S DEATHS THEIR WORDS LOOKS AND BEARING
OF CONSTANCY THE LAW OF RESOLUTION AND CONSTANCY DOES NOT IMPLY THAT WE OUGHT NOT AS MUCH AS IN US LIES
NOT A MAN WILL BE PERSUADED TO TAKE A PEN IN HAND TO THAT PURPOSE TILL THE PHYSICIAN HAS PASSED SENTENCE UPON AND TOTALLY GIVEN HIM OVER AND THEN BETWIXT AND TERROR GOD KNOWS IN HOW FIT A CONDITION
AS THEY WHO JUDGE AND TRY US WITHIN MAKE NO GREAT ACCOUNT OF THE LUSTRE OF OUR PUBLIC ACTIONS AND SEE THEY ARE ONLY STREAKS AND RAYS OF CLEAR WATER SPRINGING FROM A SLIMY AND MUDDY BOTTOM
WRETCH THAT I AM THEY CRY ONE FATAL DAY HAS DEPRIVED ME OF ALL JOYS OF LIFE
AS TO MAKE MEN OF UNDERSTANDING PERCEIVE THAT I WAS CAPABLE OF PROFITING BY KNOWLEDGE
ITS ESSENCE IS NOT SO EVIDENTLY COMMODIOUS THAT A MAN MAY NOT WITH OUT A MIRACLE REFUSE IT I FIND IT A VERY HARD THING TO UNDERGO MISFORTUNES
YET HAVE I NOT PLUNDERED ANY FRENCHMAN'S GOODS OR TAKEN HIS MONEY AND HAVE LIVED UPON WHAT IS MY OWN IN WAR AS WELL AS IN PEACE
AND IN EARNEST I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT BY FORCE OF RESPECT ITSELF MEN USE PRINCES DISDAINFULLY AND INJURIOUSLY IN THAT PARTICULAR FOR THE THING I WAS INFINITELY OFFENDED AT IN MY CHILDHOOD
WHICH TO A WELL COMPOSED SOUL SURPASSES NOT ONLY IN UTILITY BUT IN KINDNESS ALL OTHER OFFICES OF FRIENDSHIP I HAVE ALWAYS RECEIVED THEM WITH THE MOST OPEN ARMS
OUT OF ALL AUTHORITY AND SUBJECTION THOSE OF THE ANCIENT LAWS EXCEPTED AND MIGHT ENJOY ALL LIBERTY THAT WAS NOT PREJUDICIAL TO THESE BEING AS IMPATIENT OF COMMANDING AS OF BEING COMMANDED
WOULD AT THE SAME TIME TEACH THEM TO LIVE DICARCHUS MADE ONE TO WHICH HE GAVE THAT TITLE BUT IT WAS DESIGNED FOR ANOTHER AND LESS PROFITABLE END PERADVENTURE SOME ONE MAY OBJECT THAT THE PAIN AND TERROR OF DYING
HAD ANY ONE FORMERLY BROUGHT ME TO ERASMUS I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE BELIEVED BUT THAT ALL WAS ADAGE AND APOTHEGM HE SPOKE TO HIS MAN OR HIS HOSTESS
WITH THE OTHER FACULTIES THAT ASTONISH THEM AND ARE SO FAR OUT OF THEIR SIGHT
SHOULD ANY ONE PUT ME UPON COMPARING THE LIFE OF L THORIUS BALBUS A BRAVE MAN HANDSOME LEARNED HEALTHFUL UNDERSTANDING AND ABOUNDING IN ALL SORTS OF CONVENIENCES AND PLEASURES
AND IT ETERNALLY RUNS IN MY MIND THAT WHAT MAY BE DONE TO MORROW MAY BE DONE TO DAY HAZARDS AND DANGERS DO IN TRUTH LITTLE OR NOTHING HASTEN OUR END AND IF WE CONSIDER HOW MANY THOUSANDS MORE REMAIN AND HANG OVER OUR HEADS
AND HAVING UNDERSTOOD THE TRUE AND REAL GOODS WHICH MEN THE MORE ENJOY THE MORE THEY UNDERSTAND TO REST SATISFIED WITHOUT DESIRE OF PROLONGATION OF LIFE OR NAME THIS IS THE PRECEPT OF THE TRUE AND NATURAL PHILOSOPHY
AND CONSEQUENTLY IF IT FRIGHTS US TIS A PERPETUAL TORMENT FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SORT OF CONSOLATION THERE IS NO WAY BY WHICH IT MAY NOT REACH US WE MAY CONTINUALLY TURN OUR HEADS THIS WAY AND THAT
AND TO BEGIN TO DEPRIVE HIM OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE HE HAS OVER US LET US TAKE A WAY QUITE CONTRARY TO THE COMMON COURSE LET US DISARM HIM OF HIS NOVELTY AND STRANGENESS LET US CONVERSE AND BE FAMILIAR WITH HIM
TO GROUND THE RECOMPENSE OF VIRTUOUS ACTIONS UPON THE APPROBATION OF OTHERS IS TOO UNCERTAIN AND UNSAFE A FOUNDATION ESPECIALLY IN SO CORRUPT AND IGNORANT AN AGE AS THIS
NATURAL INCLINATIONS ARE MUCH ASSISTED AND FORTIFIED BY EDUCATION
RECKON UP THY ACQUAINTANCE HOW MANY MORE HAVE DIED BEFORE THEY ARRIVED AT THY AGE THAN HAVE ATTAINED UNTO IT
GRATA SUPERVENIET QUAE
I DO NOT THINK ARCESILAUS THE PHILOSOPHER THE LESS TEMPERATE AND VIRTUOUS FOR KNOWING THAT HE MADE USE OF GOLD AND SILVER VESSELS
I WOULD ALWAYS HAVE A MAN TO BE DOING AND AS MUCH AS IN HIM LIES TO EXTEND AND SPIN OUT THE OFFICES OF LIFE AND THEN LET DEATH TAKE ME PLANTING MY CABBAGES INDIFFERENT TO HIM AND STILL LESS OF MY GARDENS NOT BEING FINISHED
REMEMBER HIM WHO BEING ASKED WHY HE TOOK SO MUCH PAINS IN AN ART THAT COULD COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF BUT FEW PERSONS A FEW ARE ENOUGH FOR ME REPLIED HE I HAVE ENOUGH WITH ONE I HAVE ENOUGH
SHE IS THEN BECOME SOVEREIGN OF ALL HER LUSTS AND PASSIONS
AND MOREOVER HAS PARTICULAR TO ITSELF SO MANY SEVERAL SORTS OF SHARP AND WOUNDING PASSIONS AND SO DULL A SATIETY ATTENDING IT AS EQUAL IT TO THE SEVEREST PENANCE
EVERY MAN CARRIES THE ENTIRE FORM OF HUMAN CONDITION AUTHORS COMMUNICATE THEMSELVES TO THE PEOPLE BY SOME ESPECIAL AND EXTRINSIC MARK I THE FIRST OF ANY
NOT TO RELAX NOT TO GIVE A MAN'S SELF THE LIE IS MORE RARE AND HARD AND LESS REMARKABLE BY WHICH MEANS RETIRED LIVES WHATEVER IS SAID TO THE CONTRARY
DIED WITHIN FIVE OR SIX HOURS AFTER OF AN APOPLEXY OCCASIONED BY THAT BLOW THESE SO FREQUENT AND COMMON EXAMPLES PASSING EVERY DAY BEFORE OUR EYES
I WAS BORN BETWIXT ELEVEN AND TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE FORENOON THE LAST DAY OF FEBRUARY FIFTEEN THIRTY THREE ACCORDING TO OUR COMPUTATION
WHEREVER YOUR LIFE ENDS IT IS ALL THERE THE UTILITY OF LIVING CONSISTS NOT IN THE LENGTH OF DAYS BUT IN THE USE OF TIME A MAN MAY HAVE LIVED LONG AND YET LIVED BUT A LITTLE
I DO NOT THINK HUMANITY CAPABLE OF ENDURING SUCH A CHANGE BUT NATURE LEADING US BY THE HAND AN EASY AND AS IT WERE AN INSENSIBLE PACE STEP BY STEP CONDUCTS US TO THAT MISERABLE STATE
THE WORLD ETERNALLY TURNS ROUND ALL THINGS THEREIN ARE INCESSANTLY MOVING THE EARTH THE ROCKS OF CAUCASUS AND THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT BOTH BY THE PUBLIC MOTION AND THEIR OWN
WHICH THEY FEAR SO MUCH THE LESS BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY HAVE REMEDY AT HAND EVERY ONE SHOULD DO IN LIKE MANNER AND MOREOVER IF THEY FIND THEMSELVES SUBJECT TO SOME MORE VIOLENT DISEASE SHOULD FURNISH THEMSELVES
DOES NOT ALL THE WORLD DANCE THE SAME BRAWL THAT YOU DO IS THERE ANYTHING THAT DOES NOT GROW OLD AS WELL AS YOU A THOUSAND MEN A THOUSAND ANIMALS A THOUSAND OTHER CREATURES DIE AT THE SAME MOMENT THAT YOU DIE
I FIND FAULT THAT THEY DO NOT SO MUCH AS THINK OF THEMSELVES BUT IS IT REASON THAT BEING SO PARTICULAR IN MY WAY OF LIVING I SHOULD PRETEND TO RECOMMEND MYSELF TO THE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE
I HAVE MY LAWS AND MY JUDICATURE TO JUDGE OF MYSELF AND APPLY MYSELF MORE TO THESE THAN TO ANY OTHER RULES I DO INDEED RESTRAIN MY ACTIONS ACCORDING TO OTHERS
FOR THEY CAN ONLY BE PERCEIVED BY COMPARISON AND WE PUT THEM OUT OF THIS THEY HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUE PRAISE HAVING THEIR EARS DEAFENED WITH SO CONTINUAL AND UNIFORM AN APPROBATION
WHO CONCEAL THEMSELVES PRESENT AND LIVING
AND EMPLOY IT SEPARATELY FROM THE BODY WHICH IS A KIND OF APPRENTICESHIP AND A RESEMBLANCE OF DEATH OR ELSE BECAUSE ALL THE WISDOM AND REASONING IN THE WORLD DO IN THE END CONCLUDE IN THIS POINT TO TEACH US NOT TO FEAR TO DIE
HARD ON THE SECRETARY NURSE ROSEMARY SAT WITH HER PATIENT IN THE SUNNY LIBRARY AT GLENEESH A SMALL TABLE WAS BETWEEN THEM UPON WHICH LAY A PILE OF LETTERS HIS MORNING MAIL READY FOR HER TO OPEN
WELL TO CONTINUE MY REPORT THE VOICE GAVE US SOME TROUBLE AS YOU FORESAW AND THE WHOLE PLAN HUNG IN THE BALANCE DURING A FEW AWFUL MOMENTS FOR THOUGH HE EASILY ACCEPTED THE EXPLANATION WE HAD PLANNED HE SENT ME OUT AND TOLD DOCTOR MACKENZIE
I SHOULD LIKE TO DICTATE MY ANSWER TO THAT ONE IMMEDIATELY WHILE IT IS FRESH IN MY MIND HAVE YOU PAPER THERE THANK YOU MAY WE BEGIN DEAR MISS CHAMPION I AM DEEPLY TOUCHED BY YOUR KIND LETTER OF SYMPATHY
VOICING ITS GENEROUS APPRECIATION OF HER EFFORT AND SANGUINE EXPECTATION OF HER SUCCESS THIS AUDIENCE EXPRESSED ITS ASTONISHMENT IN THE DUBIOUSNESS OF ITS FAINT APPLAUSE JANE SMILED AT THEM GOOD NATUREDLY SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO
AND I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF REPORTING ON THE NURSE SECRETARY READER AND UNSPEAKABLY PATIENT GUIDE AND COMPANION HE PROVIDED FOR ME
THE ONLY PITY SHE FEELS IS PITY FOR HERSELF THUS HOPELESSLY CAUGHT IN THE MESHES OF HER OWN MISTAKE BUT HOW TO MAKE HIM REALISE THIS IS THE PUZZLE DO YOU REMEMBER HOW THE ISRAELITES WERE SHUT IN BETWEEN MIGDOL AND THE SEA
ARE PROVED PERFECTLY RIGHT IN YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF THE SENTIMENT OF THE CASE HE SAYS HER PITY WOULD BE THE LAST STRAW ON HIS ALREADY HEAVY CROSS AND THE EXPRESSION IS AN APT ONE HER PITY FOR HIM BEING INDEED A THING OF STRAW
MY ROSARY MY ROSARY EACH HOUR A PEARL EACH PEARL A PRAYER TO STILL A HEART IN ABSENCE WRUNG I TELL EACH BEAD UNTO THE END AND THERE A CROSS IS HUNG O MEMORIES THAT BLESS AND BURN
A FRIEND IN TROUBLE AND TO BE KEPT AWAY IT IS ONLY HER WONDERFUL KINDNESS OF HEART MAKES HER OFFER TO COME MISS GRAY SHE IS A FRIEND AND COMRADE OF LONG AGO IT WOULD GREATLY SADDEN HER TO SEE ME THUS
WITHOUT RUSHING INTO WEIRD SPELLING
RENDERED RICHER BY THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING O MEMORIES THAT BLESS AND BURN O BARREN GAIN AND BITTER LOSS I KISS EACH BEAD AND STRIVE AT LAST TO LEARN TO KISS THE CROSS TO KISS THE CROSS
PEOPLE WHO CAN BE DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA AND TALK ABOUT IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CRAWL ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND HOW ABOUT THE LITTLE MOTHER ISN'T SHE WORTH KNOWING I HOPE SHE SENT ME HER LOVE AND NEW YORK HARBOUR
THE LISTENING CROWD HELD ITS BREATH THIS WAS NOT A SONG THIS WAS THE THROBBING OF A HEART AND IT THROBBED IN TONES OF SUCH SWEETNESS THAT TEARS STARTED UNBIDDEN THEN THE VOICE WHICH HAD RENDERED THE OPENING LINES SO QUIETLY
IT DOES NOT SEEM SO TO HER PLEADED NURSE ROSEMARY AH CANNOT YOU READ BETWEEN THE LINES OR DOES IT TAKE A WOMAN'S HEART TO UNDERSTAND A WOMAN'S LETTER DID I READ IT BADLY MAY I READ IT OVER AGAIN
AND ALL HIS IDEAS IN TALKING OVER THE DINNER CONCERNED THE CLEANING UP OF THE OLD SILVER AND PUTTING OUT OF VALENTINE GLASS AND WORSTERED CHINA MASTER GARTHIE I WOULD SAY FEELING THE OCCASION CALLED FOR THE APT QUOTING OF SCRIPTURE
THE LAST FOUR WORDS WERE GIVEN WITH A SUDDEN POWER AND PASSION
AND JUST AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO MOVE HANDED A CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE AND A PLATE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN AT THE WINDOW OH THANK YOU MY GOOD FELLOW SAID JANE PUTTING THE PLATE ON THE SEAT WHILE SHE DIVED INTO HER POCKET
READ TO HIM AND PASS ACROSS SHOULD THERE CHANCE TO BE ONE AMONG THEM HE WISHED TO TOUCH OR TO KEEP IN HIS POCKET THEY WERE SEATED CLOSE TO THE FRENCH WINDOW OPENING ON TO THE TERRACE THE BREEZE FRAGRANT WITH THE BREATH OF SPRING FLOWERS BLEW ABOUT THEM
AND SHOW THEM AGAIN TO ME IN GREATER LOVELINESS I HEAR YOU RECEIVE NO VISITORS BUT CANNOT YOU MAKE JUST ONE EXCEPTION AND LET ME COME I WAS AT THE GREAT PYRAMID WHEN I HEARD I WAS SITTING ON THE PIAZZA AFTER DINNER
QUITE RIGHT SAID NURSE ROSEMARY HOW DID YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT WAS ON ONE SHEET A WOMAN'S LETTER ON A MATTER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE WOULD HAVE RUN TO TWO IF NOT THREE AND THAT LETTER WAS ON A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE
HE SLIPPED THE SEALED LETTER BENEATH THE REST SO THAT SHE SHOULD COME TO IT LAST OF ALL THEN THE USUAL ORDER OF PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED GARTH LIGHTED A CIGARETTE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE HAD LEARNED TO DO FOR HIMSELF AND SMOKED CONTENTEDLY
HE WILL ALWAYS BE BLIND DEAR BUT LIFE HOLDS OTHER THINGS BESIDE SIGHT WE MUST NEVER SAY NO HOPE WILL HE LIVE THERE IS NO REASON HE SHOULD NOT LIVE
JANE NEVER DOUBTED HER ULTIMATE DESTINATION THE ROOM WHERE PAIN AND DARKNESS AND DESPAIR MUST BE WAGING SO TERRIBLE A CONFLICT AGAINST THE MORAL COURAGE THE MENTAL SANITY AND THE INSTINCTIVE HOLD ON LIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED
I WAS WANTING TO ASK WHETHER YOU COULD SPARE ME JUST DURING FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND DOCTOR BRAND'S VISIT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY I COULD LEAVE YOU MORE EASILY KNOWING YOU WOULD HAVE HIS COMPANIONSHIP IF I MAY TAKE THE WEEK END LEAVING ON FRIDAY NIGHT
SHE EVEN ADDED HER OWN COMMENTARY AND A VERY GOOD THING TOO I AM THINKING FOR MASTER GARTH POOR LADDIE WAS ALWAYS SO SET UPON HAVING BEAUTY ABOUT HIM MASTER GARTHIE I WOULD SAY TO HIM WHEN HE HAD FRIENDS COMING
MY DEAR JEANETTE CERTAINLY I WILL COME I WILL LEAVE EUSTON ON FRIDAY EVENING I CAN SPEND THE WHOLE OF SATURDAY AND MOST OF SUNDAY AT GLENEESH BUT MUST BE HOME IN TIME FOR MONDAY'S WORK
YOU CAN HAVE NO CONCEPTION HOW OFTEN AWKWARD MOMENTS AROSE AS FOR INSTANCE IN THE LIBRARY THE FIRST TIME GARTH CAME DOWNSTAIRS WHEN HE ORDERED SIMPSON TO BRING THE STEPS FOR MISS GRAY
I NEVER THOUGHT IT SO UNTIL THAT SUMMER AT OVERDENE AND SHENSTONE WHEN YOU TAUGHT ME THE PERCEPTION OF BEAUTY SINCE THEN IN EVERY SUNSET AND SUNRISE IN THE BLUE GREEN OF THE ATLANTIC THE PURPLE OF THE MOUNTAINS THE SPRAY OF NIAGARA
KIND OLD SOUL BUT SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE MENTIONED BLIND BARTIMAEUS DIPPING SEVEN TIMES IN THE POOL OF SILOAM IT IS ALWAYS BEST TO AVOID CLASSICAL ALLUSIONS ESPECIALLY IF SACRED UNLESS ONE HAS THEM ACCURATELY NOW
SHE WAS EXPERIENCING A VERY CURIOUS AND UNUSUAL SENSATION NEVER BEFORE IN HER WHOLE LIFE HAD SHE OBEYED A PEREMPTORY COMMAND IN HER CHILDHOOD'S DAYS
MY WIRES AND POST CARDS HAVE NOT TOLD YOU MUCH BEYOND THE FACT OF MY SAFE ARRIVAL HAVING BEEN HERE A FORTNIGHT
THE LAST OF THE PILE LAY ON THE TABLE AS SHE TOOK IT UP GARTH WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT FLUNG HIS CIGARETTE END THROUGH THE WINDOW AND LAY BACK SHADING HIS FACE WITH HIS HAND DID I SHOOT STRAIGHT NURSE HE ASKED
AN UNREASONABLE ORDER OR A REASONABLE ONE UNEXPLAINED PROMPTLY MET WITH A POINT BLANK REFUSAL AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC STILL OBTAINED THOUGH MODIFIED BY TIME AND EVEN THE DUCHESS AS A RULE SAID PLEASE TO JANE
BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE QUIET VOICE FELL SOOTHINGLY EXPRESSING A STRENGTH OF ENDURANCE WHICH WOULD FAIL IN NO CRISIS NOR FEAR TO FACE ANY DEPTHS OF PAIN YET GATHERING TO ITSELF A POIGNANCY OF SWEETNESS
HELD THE LETTER SILENTLY FOR A MOMENT THEN PASSED HIS FINGERS SLOWLY OVER THE SEAL NURSE ROSEMARY WATCHED HIM ANXIOUSLY HE MADE NO REMARK BUT AFTER A MOMENT
AND AMONGST OTHER THINGS HE SAYS HE IS COMING UP TO SEE YOU NEXT SATURDAY AH GOOD SAID GARTH AND WHAT A CHANGE HE WILL FIND
SEVEN PENCE APENNY OF THIS STUFF AIN'T MUCH FOR CARRYING ALL THAT ALONG I DON'T THINK GRUMBLED HIS MATE AND JANE'S YOUNG PORTER EXPERIENCED THE DOUBLE JOY OF FAITH CONFIRMED AND WILLING SERVICE GENEROUSLY REWARDED A TELEGRAPH BOY WALKED ALONG THE TRAIN SAYING
JANE LOOKED UP FROM THE COMFORTABLE DEPTHS OF HER WICKER CHAIR THEN SMILED AT HIS ANXIOUS FACE I AM READY SHE SAID AND RISING WALKED BESIDE HIM HAS IT GONE WELL SHE ASKED IS IT A GOOD AUDIENCE PACKED REPLIED GARTH
AND WAS IMMENSELY PLEASED IF ON OPENING HIS SURMISE PROVED CORRECT THERE WERE NINE TO DAY OF VARYING INTEREST SOME FROM MEN FRIENDS ONE OR TWO FROM CHARMING WOMEN WHO PROFESSED THEMSELVES READY TO COME AND SEE HIM AS SOON AS HE WISHED FOR VISITORS
IT OBVIATES THE BOTHER OF TURNING OVER THEY PASSED INTO THE CONCERT ROOM AND STOOD BEHIND SCREENS AND A CURTAIN CLOSE TO THE HALF DOZEN STEPS LEADING FROM THE SIDE UP ON TO THE PLATFORM OH HARK TO THE DUCHESS WHISPERED GARTH
I AM GLAD NURSE ROSEMARY IS PROVING SO EFFICIENT BUT I HOPE WE MAY NOT HAVE TO FACE YET ANOTHER COMPLICATION IN OUR PROBLEM SUPPOSE OUR PATIENT FALLS IN LOVE WITH DAINTY LITTLE NURSE ROSEMARY WHERE WILL JANE BE THEN
POOR JANE HAS GOT NO FURTHER THAN HEARING FROM HIS OWN LIPS THAT SHE IS THE VERY LAST PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD HE WOULD WISH SHOULD COME NEAR HIM IN HIS BLINDNESS WHEN SHE WAS SUGGESTED AS A POSSIBLE VISITOR HE SAID
MY LETTER WAS FROM OH DON'T TELL ME CRIED GARTH QUICKLY PUTTING OUT HIS HAND IN PROTEST I HAD NO IDEA OF SEEMING CURIOUS AS TO YOUR PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE MISS GRAY
NAY MORE THAN HOPEFUL CONFIDENT OFTEN OF LATE IN CONNECTION WITH YOU I HAVE THOUGHT OF THE PROMISE ABOUT ALL THINGS WORKING TOGETHER FOR GOOD ANY ONE CAN MAKE GOOD THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD BUT ONLY THE HEAVENLY FATHER CAN BRING GOOD OUT OF EVIL
NURSE ROSEMARY FINISHED READING A LETTER OF HER OWN FOLDED IT AND PUT IT IN HER POCKET WITH A FEELING OF THANKFUL RELIEF DERYCK WAS COMING HE HAD NOT FAILED HER
THAT IS ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE MODES OF THOUGHT AND NAIVETES WHICH EVERY ONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTIST'S CONSCIENCE
THE SAGE AS ASTRONOMER SO LONG AS THOU FEELEST THE STARS AS AN ABOVE THEE THOU LACKEST THE EYE OF THE DISCERNING ONE SEVENTY TWO
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS MORAL PHENOMENA BUT ONLY A MORAL INTERPRETATION OF PHENOMENA
SUBTLER EVEN THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS A REPEATED PROOF THAT INSTINCT IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVERED
AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
ONE IS PUNISHED BEST FOR ONE'S VIRTUES
FROM THE SENSES ORIGINATE ALL TRUSTWORTHINESS ALL GOOD CONSCIENCE ALL EVIDENCE OF TRUTH
AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
HE IS NOT PERMITTED TO SIN SIXTY SIX THE TENDENCY OF A PERSON TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE DEGRADED ROBBED DECEIVED AND EXPLOITED MIGHT BE THE DIFFIDENCE OF A GOD AMONG MEN
EVEN CONCUBINAGE HAS BEEN CORRUPTED BY MARRIAGE
THAT WHICH AN AGE CONSIDERS EVIL IS USUALLY AN UNSEASONABLE ECHO OF WHAT WAS FORMERLY CONSIDERED GOOD THE ATAVISM OF AN OLD IDEAL
OUR VANITY WOULD LIKE WHAT WE DO BEST TO PASS PRECISELY FOR WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT TO US CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF MANY SYSTEMS OF MORALS
PHARISAISM IS NOT A DETERIORATION OF THE GOOD MAN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF IT IS RATHER AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION OF BEING GOOD
TO TALK MUCH ABOUT ONESELF MAY ALSO BE A MEANS OF CONCEALING ONESELF
HE WHO EXULTS AT THE STAKE DOES NOT TRIUMPH OVER PAIN
NO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE
THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
MORAL SYSTEMS MUST BE COMPELLED FIRST OF ALL TO BOW BEFORE THE GRADATIONS OF RANK THEIR PRESUMPTION MUST BE DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR CONSCIENCE UNTIL THEY THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AT LAST
NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
TWO MEN WITH THE SAME PRINCIPLES PROBABLY SEEK FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ENDS THEREWITH SEVENTY EIGHT HE WHO DESPISES HIMSELF NEVERTHELESS ESTEEMS HIMSELF THEREBY AS A DESPISER
ONE BEGINS TO DISTRUST VERY CLEVER PERSONS WHEN THEY BECOME EMBARRASSED EIGHTY NINE DREADFUL EXPERIENCES RAISE THE QUESTION WHETHER HE WHO EXPERIENCES THEM
YES BUT ONE RECOVERS IT FROM AMONG THE ASHES EIGHTY FOUR WOMAN LEARNS HOW TO HATE IN PROPORTION AS SHE FORGETS HOW TO CHARM EIGHTY FIVE
INEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAM
AND VOLTAIREAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION AND ALL THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO FREETHINKER PANTOMIME IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT TO WHICH PURITAN LITANIES
THESE ARE MEN WITHOUT DUTY WE HAVE ALWAYS FOOLS AND APPEARANCES AGAINST US
LET US GO WITH ALL OUR DEVILS TO THE HELP OF OUR GOD IT IS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND AND MISTAKE US ON THAT ACCOUNT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
WE ENJOY HOMER ONCE MORE IT IS PERHAPS OUR HAPPIEST ACQUISITION THAT WE KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE HOMER WHOM MEN OF DISTINGUISHED CULTURE
EVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWS
MALICE SPIRITUALISES THEY ARE GLAD IN THEIR INMOST HEART THAT THERE IS A STANDARD ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE OVER ENDOWED WITH INTELLECTUAL GOODS AND PRIVILEGES ARE EQUAL TO THEM
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN AS IN THE STELLAR FIRMAMENT THERE ARE SOMETIMES TWO SUNS WHICH DETERMINE THE PATH OF ONE PLANET
THERE IS A HAUGHTINESS OF KINDNESS WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF WICKEDNESS
SO WE MODERN MEN OWING TO THE COMPLICATED MECHANISM OF OUR FIRMAMENT ARE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT MORALITIES
YE UTILITARIANS YE TOO LOVE THE UTILE ONLY AS A VEHICLE FOR YOUR INCLINATIONS YE TOO REALLY FIND THE NOISE OF ITS WHEELS INSUPPORTABLE
SO IT IS SYMPATHY AGAINST SYMPATHY BUT TO REPEAT IT ONCE MORE THERE ARE HIGHER PROBLEMS THAN THE PROBLEMS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN AND SYMPATHY
THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS EVERYTHING NOW TURNS OUT BEST FOR ME I NOW LOVE EVERY FATE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE MY FATE
A SIGN OF STRONG CHARACTER WHEN ONCE THE RESOLUTION HAS BEEN TAKEN TO SHUT THE EAR EVEN TO THE BEST COUNTER ARGUMENTS OCCASIONALLY THEREFORE A WILL TO STUPIDITY
OUR VANITY IS MOST DIFFICULT TO WOUND JUST WHEN OUR PRIDE HAS BEEN WOUNDED
OR THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER NO THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND WILL BE BEST SERVED THEREBY THEY WOULD LIKE BY ALL MEANS TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING AFTER ENGLISH HAPPINESS
THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR ACTIONS SEIZE US BY THE FORELOCK VERY INDIFFERENT TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MEANWHILE REFORMED
IT IS INHUMAN TO BLESS WHEN ONE IS BEING CURSED
APPLIES TO THAT WHICH HAS TO BE FASHIONED BRUISED FORGED STRETCHED ROASTED ANNEALED REFINED
IT IS A CURIOUS THING THAT GOD LEARNED GREEK WHEN HE WISHED TO TURN AUTHOR AND THAT HE DID NOT LEARN IT BETTER
AND ARISTOPHANIC RIDICULE OF THE WORLD PERHAPS WE ARE STILL DISCOVERING THE DOMAIN OF OUR INVENTION JUST HERE THE DOMAIN WHERE EVEN WE CAN STILL BE ORIGINAL
A THING THAT IS EXPLAINED CEASES TO CONCERN US WHAT DID THE GOD MEAN WHO GAVE THE ADVICE KNOW THYSELF DID IT PERHAPS IMPLY CEASE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THYSELF BECOME OBJECTIVE
EIGHTY TWO SYMPATHY FOR ALL WOULD BE HARSHNESS AND TYRANNY FOR THEE MY GOOD NEIGHBOUR EIGHTY THREE INSTINCT WHEN THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE ONE FORGETS EVEN THE DINNER
THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME
ESPRIT VASTE AND EVEN VOLTAIRE THE LAST ECHO OF THE CENTURY CANNOT AND COULD NOT SO EASILY APPROPRIATE WHOM THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE VERY DECIDED YEA
AND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ITS MOMENTS OF DESPERATION ON ACCOUNT OF NOTHING SUITING US IT IS IN VAIN TO GET OURSELVES UP AS ROMANTIC OR CLASSICAL OR CHRISTIAN
BUT IN FACT WOMAN IS ESSENTIALLY UNPEACEABLE LIKE THE CAT HOWEVER WELL SHE MAY HAVE ASSUMED THE PEACEABLE DEMEANOUR
OR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY AND NO FACULTY IS MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SUCH MEN THAN JUST THIS HISTORICAL SENSE WITH ITS TRUCKLING PLEBEIAN CURIOSITY
SEVERAL TIMES JEREMIAH CAME OUT OF THE PARLOUR IN WHICH HIS BROTHER JOHN WAS SITTING IN EXPECTANT SILENCE AND PASSING THROUGH THE SHOP LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE MARKET PLACE IN SEARCH OF THE OLD LAME WOMAN WHO WAS CHARITABLY EMPLOYED TO DELIVER LETTERS
BUT SHE WEARY OF A SUBJECT SHE CARED NOTHING ABOUT AND EAGER TO IDENTIFY HERSELF WITH ALL HIS INTERESTS ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS PLANS ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE SAID THESE LAST WORDS AND THEY WENT ON AS LOVERS DO
JOHN PERCEIVED THAT HIS MESSENGER WOULD EXERCISE PENETRATION AND ACT WITH ENERGY WHILE JEREMIAH WAS SOOTHED BY PHILIP'S CAUTION IN NOT HASTILY ADMITTING THE PROBABILITY OF ANY CHARGE AGAINST DICKINSON AND IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT TO HIS PREVIOUS GOOD CONDUCT AND GOOD CHARACTER
PUT ON THY THINGS IN A JIFFY THEN AND LET'S BE OFF SAID DANIEL AND SYLVIA DID NOT NEED ANOTHER WORD DOWN SHE CAME IN A TWINKLING DRESSED IN HER NEW RED CLOAK AND HOOD HER FACE PEEPING OUT OF THE FOLDS OF THE LATTER BRIGHT AND BLUSHING
BUT THERE'S HEAT TOO SOME PLACES SAID KINRAID
WE SAILED ON AND WE SAILED ON FOR MORE DAYS NOR I COULD COUNT
CAREFULLY PINNED ACROSS AT THE WAIST OF HER BROWN STUFF GOWN HOW WELL IT WAS THOUGHT THE YOUNG GIRL THAT SHE HAD DOFFED HER BED GOWN AND LINSEY WOOLSEY PETTICOAT HER WORKING DRESS AND MADE HERSELF SMART IN HER STUFF GOWN WHEN SHE SATE DOWN TO WORK WITH HER MOTHER
WHEN AS IN THE PAST SHE TOOK HER KNITTING OUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE FRESHNESS OF THE FAINT SEA BREEZE AND DROPPING DOWN FROM LEDGE TO LEDGE OF THE ROCKS THAT FACED THE BLUE OCEAN ESTABLISHED HERSELF IN A PERILOUS NOOK THAT HAD BEEN HER HAUNT EVER SINCE HER PARENTS HAD COME TO HAYTERSBANK FARM
AND ONE WAS ON HER LEFT HAND WHICH SHE SUPPOSED HERSELF TO BE MENDING BUT FROM TIME TO TIME SHE MADE LONG PAUSES AND LOOKED IN THE FIRE AND YET THERE WAS BUT LITTLE MOTION OF FLAME OR LIGHT IN IT OUT OF WHICH TO CONJURE VISIONS
AND TO WARN YO IF NEED WERE MY MOTHER NIVER BADE YO TO COME SPYING AFTER ME AND BLAMING ME FOR SEEING A LAD AS MY FEYTHER THINKS WELL ON
I'LL NOT DENY BUT AT OTHER TIMES I'M PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT ON'T BUT IF I COULD I'D CHANGE PLACES WI THEE AT THIS MOMENT IT'S FINE TALKING SAID COULSON HALF MOLLIFIED AND YET NOT CARING TO SHOW IT I MAKE NO DOUBT IT WERE AN EVEN CHANCE BETWIXT US TWO AT FIRST
GOING AND DOUBTING AND ENVYING PHILIP AS NIVER DID THEE AN ILL TURN OR SAID AN ILL WORD OR THOUGHT AN ILL THOUGHT BY THEE AND SENDING HIM AWAY OUT O T HOUSE THIS LAST NIGHT OF ALL
HE JUST DWINED AWAY AND WE HADN'T TAKEN BUT ONE WHALE AFORE OUR CAPTAIN DIED
SHE DID NOT COME FORWARD TO MEET HIM SHE WENT CRIMSON TO THE VERY ROOTS OF HER HAIR BUT THAT IN THE WANING LIGHT HE COULD NOT SEE AND SHE SHOOK SO THAT SHE FELT AS IF SHE COULD HARDLY STAND BUT THE TREMOR WAS NOT VISIBLE TO HIM
IT'S A CHANCE MISSUS AS THOU HAD STOPPED AN OUD MAID EH DEAR A ME SAID BELL
FOR UP IN THE NORTH THERE IS AN IDEA THAT THE ICE STORED IN THE FIRST FROST WILL MELT AND THE MEAT CURED THEN TAINT THE FIRST FROST IS GOOD FOR NOTHING BUT TO BE THROWN AWAY AS THEY EXPRESS IT THERE CAME A BREATHING TIME AFTER THIS LAST EVENT
WE'N BEST KEEP THIS MATTER TO OURSELVES TILL THOU COMES INT PORT AGAIN
THE SKY ABOVE WAS BRIGHT AND CLEAR WITH THE LIGHT OF A THOUSAND STARS
BEFORE GOING TO SEA SAID PHILIP HALF SMILING NA
THERE WAS MUCH TO BE DONE IN FOSTERS SHOP AND LATER HOURS WERE KEPT THAN USUAL SOME PERPLEXITY OR OTHER WAS OCCUPYING JOHN AND JEREMIAH FOSTER
FROM THENCE SHE HAD OFTEN SEEN THE DISTANT SHIPS PASS TO AND FRO WITH A CERTAIN SORT OF LAZY PLEASURE IN WATCHING THEIR SWIFT TRANQUILLITY OF MOTION
AND HERE THEY WERE READY FOR BREAD AND CHEESE AND AUGHT ELSE THE MISTRESS WOULD SET BEFORE THEM
AND THEN THEY SAT DOWN ON THE SETTLE TOGETHER AND WHEN SHE WAS MORE COMPOSED THEY BEGAN TO TALK HE ASKED HER ABOUT HER MOTHER NOT SORRY IN HIS HEART AT BELL ROBSON'S ABSENCE
PERHAPS MORE SILENT THAN SHE HAD BEEN A YEAR AGO AND SHE DID NOT ATTEND SO BRISKLY TO WHAT WAS PASSING AROUND HER SHE WAS RATHER THINNER AND PALER BUT WHATEVER CHANGE THERE WAS IN HER WAS ALWAYS AN IMPROVEMENT IN PHILIP'S EYES
SAID SYLVIA SHIVERING ALL OVER WITH PASSION
HE WOULD POUR OUT HIS LOVE AT HER FEET NOT EVEN URGING THE YOUNG GIRL TO MAKE ANY RETURN OR TO EXPRESS THE FEELINGS OF WHICH HE HOPED THE GERM WAS ALREADY BUDDING IN HER HE WOULD BE PATIENT WITH HER HE COULD NOT BE PATIENT HIMSELF
SHE DIED IN A SIX MONTH SAID WILLIAM SHE FORGIVED HIM BUT IT'S BEYOND ME I THOUGHT IT WERE HIM WHEN I HEERD OF T WORK ABOUT DARLEY KINRAID AND COMING FRA NEWCASSEL WHERE ANNIE LIVED PRENTICE AND I MADE INQUIRY
THE BUTCHER HAD BEEN GLAD TO TAKE THE BEST PARTS OF A PIG OF DAME ROBSON'S CAREFUL FEEDING BUT THERE WAS UNUSUAL PLENTY IN THE HAYTERSBANK PANTRY AND AS BELL SURVEYED IT ONE MORNING SHE SAID TO HER HUSBAND
WI'OUT SAYING GREAT THINGS O MYSEL SO I SAYS
HAD GIVEN HIM THE CHANCE OF SEEING HER ALONE AND OBTAINING HER PROMISE TO MARRY HIM WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED TO TELL EITHER HER FATHER OR HER MOTHER AT PRESENT I HA SPENT MY MONEY PRETTY FREE HE SAID AND I'VE NE'ER A PENNY TO THE FORE
SHE HASTILY GOT UP AND LEFT THE ROOM
AND TILL HE HAD PATIENTLY WITH LONG CONTINUING AND DEEP AFFECTION WORKED HIS WAY INTO HER REGARD WAS SET ASIDE DURING THE PRESENT WALK HE WOULD SPEAK TO HER OF HIS PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR AN UNCERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND THE CERTAIN DISTANCE OF LONDON
AN OUD MAN LIKE ME ISN'T AS GOOD COMPANY AS A PRETTY LASS LAUGHING A LOW RICH LAUGH OVER HIS OWN WIT DANIEL WENT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND CALLED SYLVIE
AND SAYS I BUT WHO'S TO STAY BY T DEAD FISH AND NO MAN ANSWERED
I'LL RECKON TO HEAR FRO THEE IN A WEEK OR MAYHAP LESS
THOUGH OUR SHIP LAY A FORTNEET OFF GRAVESEND KINRAID NOW SEEMED IN A HURRY BUT PHILIP WAS STUNG WITH CURIOSITY TO ASCERTAIN HIS MOVEMENTS AND SUDDENLY ADDRESSED HIM I HEARD YO WERE THESE PARTS
DARK THE WOOD FIRE NOT GATHERED TOGETHER BY CAREFUL HANDS DIED OUT INTO GRAY ASHES DOLLY REID HAD DONE HER WORK AND GONE HOME THERE WERE BUT PHILIP AND SYLVIA IN THE HOUSE
INDEED THEY WERE OFTEN MORE COMMUNICATIVE TO THE SHEEP DOG THAT ACCOMPANIED THEM THROUGH ALL THE DAY'S WORK AND FREQUENTLY BECAME A SORT OF DUMB CONFIDANT
THE NEED FOR HIS DEPARTURE AND YET HE STOOD STILL FOR A LITTLE TIME LIKE ONE ENTRANCED AS IF HIS WILL HAD LOST ALL POWER TO COMPEL HIM TO LEAVE THE PLACE THOSE TWO WORDS OF HERS WHICH TWO HOURS BEFORE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO FAR BENEATH HIS ASPIRATIONS
AND TOUCHED HER PRIDE MAYBE TOO
BLACK AND BITTER BUT WELCOME ENOUGH TO THE FARMERS
THE NEXT ROSE UP EQUALLY NATURALLY IN THE MIND OF MISSUS CORNEY AND WHAT WILL YE TAK
GREEDY AND BREATHLESS SOME ON EM IS PAST TELLING HE REPLIED AN SOME IS NOT TO BE HAD FOR T ASKING SEEING AS HOW THEY MIGHT BRING A MAN INTO TROUBLE BUT AS A SAID
ROBSON LISTENED TO ALL HE SAID WITH APPROVING NODS AND WINKS TILL CHARLEY HAD TOLD HIM EVERYTHING HE HAD TO SAY AND THEN HE TURNED AND STRUCK HIS BROAD HORNY PALM INTO KINRAID'S AS IF CONCLUDING A BARGAIN
SAID COULSON LUCK SAID ALICE TURNING SHARP ROUND ON HIM NIVER LET ME HEAR SUCH A VAIN WORD OUT O THY MOUTH LADDIE AGAIN IT'S THE LORD'S DOING AND LUCK'S THE DEVIL'S WAY O PUTTING IT
AS DISTURBING HER IN THE ONE BLESSED SUBJECT OF THOUGHT IN WHICH ALONE SHE CARED TO INDULGE WELL PHILIP AN WHAT BRINGS HERE WAS HER RATHER UNGRACIOUS GREETING WHY SYLVIE ARE YO SORRY TO SEE ME
JUST BREAK IT UP WITH A JUDICIOUS BLOW FROM THE POKER AND THE ROOM LATE SO DARK AND DUSK AND LONE IS FULL OF LIFE AND LIGHT AND WARMTH SHE MOVED ABOUT WITH PRETTY HOUSEHOLD BRISKNESS ATTENDING TO ALL HER FATHER'S WANTS
AND YO'R PARENTS MAY LOOK FOR SOMETHING BETTER FOR YO MY PRETTY
SYLVIE I'M GOING AWAY SAY GOOD BY NO ANSWER NOT A SOUND HEARD SYLVIE A LITTLE LOUDER AND LESS HOARSELY SPOKEN THERE WAS NO REPLY SYLVIE
BUT SOMEHOW SHE DID NOT LIKE TO PROPOSE IT TOWARDS DUSK SHE CAME TO HER MOTHER TO ASK FOR THE KEY OF THE GREAT BUREAU THAT STOOD IN THE HOUSE PLACE AS A STATE PIECE OF FURNITURE ALTHOUGH ITS USE WAS TO CONTAIN THE FAMILY'S BEST WEARING APPAREL AND STORES OF LINEN
BUT THEY'RE A DEEP SET THEY'LL BE HERE BEFORE WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE SOME OF THESE DAYS
SO THEY PARTED BUT PHILIP HAD NOT GONE MANY STEPS BEFORE HIS UNCLE CALLED HIM BACK KINRAID SLOWLY LOITERING ON MEANWHILE
MORE UNUSUAL SHE HEARD HIS VOICE TALKING TO SOME COMPANION CURIOUS TO SEE WHO IT COULD BE WITH A LIVELY INSTINCTIVE ADVANCE TOWARDS ANY EVENT WHICH MIGHT BREAK THE MONOTONY SHE HAD BEGUN TO FIND SOMEWHAT DULL SHE SPRANG UP TO OPEN THE DOOR
BUT SYLVIA ENJOYED HER OWN THOUGHTS AND ANY CONVERSATION WOULD HAVE BEEN A DISTURBANCE TO HER THE LONG MONOTONOUS ROLL OF THE DISTANT WAVES AS THE TIDE BORE THEM IN THE MULTITUDINOUS RUSH AT LAST AND THEN THE RETREATING RATTLE AND TRICKLE
AND HE BEGAN THE STORY SYLVIA KNEW SO WELL FOR HER FATHER NEVER MADE A NEW ACQUAINTANCE BUT WHAT HE TOLD HIM OF HIS SELF MUTILATION TO ESCAPE THE PRESS GANG IT HAD BEEN DONE AS HE WOULD HIMSELF HAVE OWNED TO SPITE HIMSELF AS WELL AS THEM
SUDDENLY A LIGHT SHONE DOWN INTO PHILIP'S MIND HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED AS HE SPOKE NEXT
WHEN SHE HAD ARGUED HERSELF INTO CERTAINTY ON ONE SIDE SHE SUDDENLY WHEELED ABOUT AND WAS JUST OF THE OPPOSITE OPINION AT LENGTH SHE SETTLED THAT IT COULD NOT BE SETTLED UNTIL SHE SAW MOLLY AGAIN SO BY A STRONG GULPING EFFORT SHE RESOLUTELY DETERMINED TO THINK NO MORE ABOUT HIM
IT WAS THE TIME OF THE GREAT HALF YEARLY TRAFFIC OF THE PLACE ANOTHER IMPETUS WAS GIVEN TO BUSINESS WHEN THE WHALERS RETURNED IN THE AUTUMN AND THE MEN WERE FLUSH OF MONEY AND FULL OF DELIGHT AT ONCE MORE SEEING THEIR HOMES AND THEIR FRIENDS
HE HAD ONLY COME THAT AFTERNOON TO MONKSHAVEN AND FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SEEING SYLVIA ONCE MORE BEFORE HE WENT TO FULFIL HIS ENGAGEMENT AS SPECKSIONEER IN THE URANIA A WHALING VESSEL THAT WAS TO SAIL FROM NORTH SHIELDS ON THURSDAY MORNING AND THIS WAS MONDAY
WELL SIR THE EVENING AFTER YOU LEFT ME I HAD WHAT YOU MAY CALL AN EXPLANATION WITH MY DEAR GIRL
AND WHAT DO THEY INDICATE TYPHUS OF THE MOST MALIGNANT CHARACTER NOT A DOUBT OF IT COME UP AND LOOK AT HIM I SAW MISTER BERNARD START AND GLANCE QUICKLY AT MY BROTHER RALPH FIXED HIS EYES SEARCHINGLY ON HIS FRIEND'S FACE EXCLAIMED
NOT ONE LEAF EVEN OF THE MUSIC ON THE PIANO WAS DOGS EARED OR WORN NEVER WAS A RICHLY FURNISHED ROOM MORE THOROUGHLY COMFORTLESS THAN THIS THE EYE ACHED AT LOOKING ROUND IT THERE WAS NO REPOSE ANYWHERE
THAT IS ANOTHER NEVER MIND MY INTERESTS CLARA I CAN ONLY THINK OF CLARA BUT YOU HAVE INTERESTS AND YOU MUST THINK OF THEM I TOLD MY FATHER OF THE DEATH OF THAT UNHAPPY WOMAN AND OF YOUR NOBLE BEHAVIOUR WHEN SHE WAS DYING
NOBODY WHO ADMITS THAT THE BUSINESS OF FICTION IS TO EXHIBIT HUMAN LIFE CAN DENY THAT SCENES OF MISERY AND CRIME MUST OF NECESSITY WHILE HUMAN NATURE REMAINS WHAT IT IS FORM PART OF THAT EXHIBITION
AFTER HAVING FORBIDDEN HER EVER TO ENTER THIS HOUSE AGAIN HE NOW ONLY SHOWS HOW HE IS OFFENDED BY HIS SILENCE AND IT IS EXACTLY THAT OF COURSE WHICH DISTRESSES HER BETWEEN HER NOTIONS OF IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE TO HIM AND HER OPPOSITE NOTIONS JUST AS STRONG OF HER SISTERLY DUTIES TO YOU
I ALLOWED THE PRURIENT MISINTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PERFECTLY INNOCENT PASSAGES IN THIS BOOK TO ASSERT ITSELF AS OFFENSIVELY AS IT PLEASED WITHOUT TROUBLING MYSELF TO PROTEST AGAINST AN EXPRESSION OF OPINION WHICH AROUSED IN ME NO OTHER FEELING THAN A FEELING OF CONTEMPT
TO RISK THE MISERY TO BOTH OF US OF SAYING FAREWELL WAS MORE THAN I DARED TRUST MYSELF TO DO I COULD ONLY STAND SILENT AND LOOK AT HER IT MIGHT BE FOR THE LAST TIME UNTIL THE TEARS GATHERED IN MY EYES SO THAT I COULD SEE NOTHING MORE
YOU WILL BE LESS SURPRISED TO HEAR HOW THEY ARE LIKELY TO AFFECT ME IN THE STEP I AM NOW TAKING HE DISAPPROVES OF IT OF COURSE STRONGLY PERHAPS
OF ANY MAN FROM A BARONET UP TO A DUKE WHOSE FAMILY WAS LESS ANCIENT THAN HIS OWN AMONG A HOST OF INSTANCES OF THIS PECULIAR PRIDE OF HIS WHICH I COULD CITE I REMEMBER ONE CHARACTERISTIC ENOUGH TO BE TAKEN AS A SAMPLE
VERY PROPER A VERY PROPER WAY OF PUTTING IT PRACTICAL IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO SAY SO
ON THIS OCCASION WHEN I WAS SHOWN INTO THE DRAWING ROOM BOTH MISTER AND MISSUS SHERWIN WERE AWAITING ME THERE ON THE TABLE WAS THE SHERRY WHICH HAD BEEN SO PERSEVERINGLY PRESSED ON ME AT THE LAST INTERVIEW AND BY IT A NEW POUND CAKE
NOT ENTIRELY A STRANGER SIR IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO SAY SO INDEED I HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE SIR AND PROFIT AND
OVER HER GRAVE WHILE HE UTTERED THE LAST WORDS I FELT MY SELF POSSESSION RETURNING I COULD NOT FORCE MYSELF TO SPEAK AS I WOULD FAIN HAVE SPOKEN I COULD ONLY MOVE AWAY TO LEAVE HIM STOP HE SAID
IN THE SECRET THEATRE OF HOME TRAGEDIES WHICH ARE EVER SHADOWED BY THE SLOW FALLING OF THE BLACK CURTAIN THAT DROPS LOWER AND LOWER EVERY DAY THAT DROPS TO HIDE ALL AT LAST FROM THE HAND OF DEATH
MISTER BERNARD HESITATED A MOMENT AND CONSIDERED I THINK I CAN MANAGE IT FOR YOU WITH THE PORTER AFTER YOU ARE GONE HE SAID PROVIDED YOU LEAVE ME FREE TO GIVE ANY REMUNERATION I MAY THINK NECESSARY
THE PICTURES SOME OF THE FINEST PIECES I EVER SAW I WAS DELIGHTED QUITE DELIGHTED INDEED HE SPOKE IN UNDER TONES LAYING GREAT STRESS UPON PARTICULAR WORDS THAT WERE EVIDENTLY FAVOURITES WITH HIM SUCH AS INDEED
WHEN I ARRIVED I FOUND HER SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THE WORST ATTACKS OF TYPHUS I EVER REMEMBER TO HAVE SEEN AND I THINK IT MY DUTY TO STATE CANDIDLY THAT I BELIEVE HER LIFE TO BE IN IMMINENT DANGER AT THE SAME TIME IT IS RIGHT TO INFORM YOU THAT THE GENTLEMAN IN ATTENDANCE ON HER DOES NOT SHARE MY OPINION
A PROFOUND SECRET AMONG OURSELVES UNTIL I CAN DIVULGE MY MARRIAGE TO MY FATHER WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF BUT I TELL YOU SIR I CAN'T SEE MY WAY THROUGH IT AT ALL CHANCE WHAT CHANCE WOULD THERE BE AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME
I HAVE ONLY SEEN HIM SMILE THERE WERE OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF MY FATHER'S DISPOSITION AND MANNER WHICH I MIGHT MENTION BUT THEY WILL APPEAR TO GREATER ADVANTAGE PERHAPS HEREAFTER CONNECTED WITH CIRCUMSTANCES
AND ACTUALLY INSISTED ON WORKING IN A HOSPITAL WHEN HE MIGHT HAVE IDLED IN A FAMILY LIVING THIS IS THE MAN THE BEST OF DOCTORS AND GOOD FELLOWS ARE YOU BRINGING YOUR BROTHER TO THE HOSPITAL TO FOLLOW MY MAD EXAMPLE ASKED MISTER BERNARD AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME NOT EXACTLY JACK
IN THE VERY LAST PLACE AND UNDER THE VERY LAST CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE ARTIFICES OF SENTIMENTAL WRITING WOULD SANCTION WILL MY LOVERS EXCITE RIDICULE INSTEAD OF INTEREST BECAUSE I HAVE TRULY REPRESENTED THEM AS SEEING EACH OTHER WHERE HUNDREDS OF OTHER LOVERS HAVE FIRST SEEN EACH OTHER
HE WAS A POLITICAL REFUGEE DEPENDENT FOR THE BREAD HE ATE ON THE MONEY HE RECEIVED FOR TEACHING LANGUAGES HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BEGGAR FROM THE STREETS AND STILL MY FATHER WOULD HAVE TREATED HIM AS THE PRINCIPAL GUEST IN THE HOUSE FOR THIS ALL SUFFICIENT REASON
THIS SHERRY STANDS ME IN SIX SHILLINGS A BOTTLE OUGHT TO BE FIRST RATE WINE AT THAT PRICE AND SO IT IS WELL IF YOU WON'T HAVE ANY MORE WE WILL PROCEED TO BUSINESS HA HA BUSINESS AS I CALL IT
I WARN YOU TO LOOK SHARPLY AFTER HIM WHEN HE LEAVES THE HOSPITAL EITHER THERE HAS BEEN MADNESS IN HIS FAMILY OR HIS BRAIN HAS SUFFERED FROM HIS EXTERNAL INJURIES LEGALLY HE MAY BE QUITE FIT TO BE AT LARGE
SAID YOUR GOOD HEALTH SIR YOUR VERY GOOD HEALTH
I RESISTED THE TEMPTATION TO DASH THEM AWAY WHILE THEY STILL HID HER FROM ME WHILE I COULD NOT SEE HER AGAIN IF I WOULD I TURNED FROM THE GARDEN VIEW AND LEFT THE SQUARE
BRAGGADOCIO ABOUT RANK AND BREEDING MY FATHER'S PRIDE HAD NOTHING OF THIS ABOUT IT IT WAS THAT QUIET NEGATIVE COURTEOUS INBRED PRIDE WHICH ONLY THE CLOSEST OBSERVATION COULD DETECT
OCCASIONALLY SHE MIXES OTHER NAMES WITH YOURS AND MENTIONS THEM IN TERMS OF ABHORRENCE BUT HER PERSISTENCY IN CALLING FOR YOUR PRESENCE IS SO REMARKABLE THAT I AM TEMPTED MERELY FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD MYSELF TO SUGGEST THAT YOU REALLY SHOULD GO TO HER
THIS IS WHY IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO KEEP OUR UNION SECRET AT FIRST I WONDERED THEN I HAVE SINCE WONDERED MORE HOW IT WAS THAT I CONTRIVED TO SPEAK THUS
HE JUST LAID HIS HAND ON HER ARM AND WHISPERED SOMETHING TO HER AND THOUGH SHE TURNED AS PALE AS ASHES SHE WAS QUIET DIRECTLY THE NEXT THING THEY SAY HE DID WAS TO GIVE HER A SLIP OF PAPER COOLLY DIRECTING HER TO GO TO THE ADDRESS WRITTEN ON IT
YES YES HIGH PRINCIPLES SIR HIGH PRINCIPLES THANK GOD
HE WOULD ALLOW US AS BOYS TO QUIT THE BREAKFAST TABLE BEFORE HE HAD RISEN HIMSELF
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY TO ASK YOUR DAUGHTER'S HAND IN MARRIAGE BUT A THOUGHT OF MY FATHER MOVED DARKLY OVER MY MIND AT THAT MOMENT AND THE WORDS WOULD NOT PASS MY LIPS WELL SIR TO WHAT THE TONE IN WHICH HE SAID THIS WAS HARSH ENOUGH TO ROUSE ME
WHO SHRINK FROM ALL HONEST AND SERIOUS REFERENCE IN BOOKS TO SUBJECTS WHICH THEY THINK OF IN PRIVATE AND TALK OF IN PUBLIC EVERYWHERE WHO SEE COVERT IMPLICATIONS WHERE NOTHING IS IMPLIED AND IMPROPER ALLUSIONS WHERE NOTHING IMPROPER IS ALLUDED TO WHOSE INNOCENCE IS IN THE WORD AND NOT IN THE THOUGHT
THAT TO DISGRACE OUR FAMILY EITHER BY WORD OR ACTION WAS THE ONE FATAL CRIME WHICH COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN AND NEVER BE PARDONED WE WERE FORMED UNDER HIS SUPERINTENDENCE IN PRINCIPLES OF RELIGION HONOUR AND INDUSTRY
SHE MADE NO OBJECTION AND I AM THEREFORE I THINK JUSTIFIED IN CONSIDERING THAT IF YOU AUTHORISED THE REMOVAL OF SCRUPLES WHICH DO HER HONOUR AT PRESENT SHE WOULD NOT FEEL THE DELICACY SHE DOES NOW AT SANCTIONING MY ADDRESSES
WHEN HE ACCIDENTALLY MET ANY OF THOSE FARMERS WIVES WHO THAT NOTICED HIS HEARTY WELCOME TO THE MAN OF THE PEOPLE WHEN THAT MAN HAPPENED TO BE A MAN OF GENIUS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIM PROUD
NOW BERNARD HE SAID YOU HAVE A MAN HERE WHO CALLS HIMSELF MISTER TURNER ARE YOU A FRIEND OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PATIENT WONDERFUL THE STUDENTS CALL HIM THE GREAT MYSTERY OF LONDON
SOME OF THE MOST VALUED FRIENDS I NOW POSSESS WERE MADE FOR ME BY BASIL SOME OF THE MOST GRATIFYING RECOGNITIONS OF MY LABOURS WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED FROM READERS PERSONALLY STRANGERS TO ME HAVE BEEN RECOGNITIONS OF THE PURITY OF THIS STORY FROM THE FIRST PAGE TO THE LAST
WHEN SHE ENTERED THE WARD AND HOW SHE RAN TO THE WRONG BED BEFORE THE NURSE COULD STOP HER THE MAN WHOM SHE THUS MISTOOK FOR TURNER WAS SUFFERING FROM FEVER WHICH HAD NOT THEN SPECIFICALLY DECLARED ITSELF BUT WHICH DID SO DECLARE ITSELF AS A TYPHUS FEVER
AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE LOOKED EXCESSIVELY FLURRIED AND EXCITED SEEING THE WARD QUITE FULL AND PERHAPS NOT BEING USED TO HOSPITALS HOWEVER IT WAS THOUGH THE NURSE POINTED OUT THE RIGHT BED TO HER SHE RAN IN A MIGHTY HURRY TO THE WRONG ONE I UNDERSTAND SAID RALPH
THE MOST ORDINARY STREET SOUNDS THAT COULD BE HEARD AND THE MOST ORDINARY STREET EVENTS THAT COULD OCCUR AT THE TIME AND IN THE PLACE REPRESENTED BELIEVING THAT BY ADDING TO TRUTH THEY WERE ADDING TO TRAGEDY ADDING BY ALL THE FORCE OF FAIR CONTRAST
OF THE PERSIAN COMMERCIAL MIND WHILE THIS QUESTION IS BEING MOOTED A FIGURE APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY
AND HOLDS HER LONG STIFF BUGGY WHIP SO THAT IT SWIPES ME VICIOUSLY ACROSS THE FACE KNOCKS MY HELMET OFF INTO THE MUD DITCH
I FEEL TOO INDEPENDENT THIS MORNING TO SACRIFICE ANY OF THE WELLNIGH INVISIBLE REMNANT OF DIGNITY REMAINING FROM THE RESPECTABLE QUANTITY WITH WHICH I STARTED INTO ASIA FOR I STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF THE WHEATEN QUOITS I BROUGHT FROM YUZGAT
BACALEM YOLE LAZIM BACALEM SABA I REPLY FOR IT IS TOO DARK TO RIDE ON UNKNOWN GROUND THIS EVENING BIN BACALEM REPEATS THE PASHA KHAN EVEN MORE DICTATORIAL THAN BEFORE
IS THE MOST ROMANTIC INCIDENT IN HER WHOLE EXPERIENCES OF MISSIONARY LIFE IN PERSIA LIKE MANY ANOTHER SHE SAYS
WITHOUT GIVING THEM TIME TO REVEAL WHETHER THEY SERIOUSLY INTEND ATTACKING ME OR ONLY TO TRY INTIMIDATION I HAVE THEM NICELY COVERED WITH THE SMITH AND WESSON THEY SEEM TO COMPREHEND IN A MOMENT
OR TO BE WORRIED FROM ONE'S WAKING MOMENTS TO THE DEPARTURE FROM THE VILLAGE AND OF THE TWO EVILS ONE COMES FINALLY TO PREFER THE EARLY RISING ONE CAN ALWAYS OBTAIN SOMETHING TO EAT BEFORE STARTING BY WAITING TILL AN HOUR AFTER SUNRISE
I AGREE TO HIS PROPOSAL AND ACCOMPANY HIM BACK TEA IS AT ONCE PROVIDED
OF A TRIBUTARY OF THE ARASCES TOWARD OVAHJIK WHERE RESIDES THE PASHA KHAN TO WHOM I HAVE A LETTER BUT THE CRESCENT SHAPED MOON SHEDS ABROAD A SILVERY GLIMMER
IS HALF BURIED IN HOT DUST THE BLACKBERRIES ARE DEAD ON THE BUSHES AND THE LONG SUFFERING CORN LOOKS AS THOUGH AFFLICTED WITH THE YELLOW JAUNDICE
IT IS NOT FAIR PERHAPS TO PASS JUDGMENT ON YUZGAT'S PRETENSIONS BY THE DAMSELS OF ONE FAMILY CONNECTION NOT EVEN THE GREAT AND NUMEROUS PAMPASIAN PAMPARSAN FAMILY BUT STILL THEY OUGHT TO BE AT LEAST A FAIR AVERAGE
DELIVERS ME OVER TO ANOTHER SOLDIER HIMSELF RETURNING BACK THIS IS MY FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY AND SOON AFTER LEAVING THE VILLAGE I BID MY VALIANT PROTECTOR RETURN THE MAN SEEMS TOTALLY UNABLE TO COMPREHEND WHY
WHERE FROM THE LITTLE HAMLET OF SPRINGFIELD THE ROADS BECOME GOOD THEN BETTER AND FINALLY BEST AT GIRARD THE HOME OF THE VETERAN SHOWMAN DAN RICE THE BEAUTIFYING WORKS OF WHOSE GENEROUS HAND ARE EVERYWHERE VISIBLE IN HIS NATIVE TOWN
A WAGON ROAD HAVING BEEN MADE FROM SIVAS INTO THIS FOREST TO ENABLE THE PEOPLE TO HAUL WOOD AND BUILDING TIMBER ON THEIR ARABAS ARRIVING AT A GOOD SIZED AND COMPARATIVELY WELL TO DO MUSSULMAN VILLAGE
BUT FUEL IS AS SCARCE AS IN ASIA MINOR AND LIKE THE TURKS AND ARMENIANS IN WINTER THEY HAVE RESOURCE TO A PECULIAR AND ECONOMICAL ARRANGEMENT TO KEEP THEMSELVES WARM
I PROCEED TO BUFFALO NEXT MORNING CATCHING THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THAT IMPORTANT SEAPORT OF THE LAKES WHERE FIFTEEN MILES ACROSS THE BAY THE WAGON ROAD IS ALMOST LICKED BY THE SWASHING WAVES AND ENTERING THE CITY OVER A MISFIT PLANK ROAD
THIS DOUBTLESS COMES OF THE PURE CONTRARINESS OF HUMAN NATURE IN THE ABSENCE OF SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS THEIR RELIGION TEACHES THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY OUGHT TO BATHE EVERY DAY CONSEQUENTLY THEY NEVER BATHE AT ALL
NIGHTFALL OVERTAKES ME AS AFTER TRAVELLING SEVERAL MILES OF VARIABLE ROAD I COMMENCE
THE AFFRIGHTED KATIR JEE'S FIRST IMPULSE IS TO SEEK REFUGE IN FLIGHT NOT INFREQUENTLY BOLTING CLEAR OFF THE ROADWAY BEFORE VENTURING UPON TAKING A SECOND LOOK SOMETIMES I SIMPLY PUT ON A SPURT AND WHISK PAST AT A FIFTEEN MILE PACE
AND APPEARS ANXIOUS TO ATONE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FOR THE LITTLE INCIVILITY OF YESTERDAY EVENING AND TO REMOVE ANY UNFAVORABLE IMPRESSIONS I MAY PERCHANCE ENTERTAIN OF HIM ON THAT ACCOUNT BEFORE I LEAVE
THE SERVANT WHO PRESENTS MY LETTER OF INTRODUCTION FILLS THE UNTUTORED MIND OF HIS MASTER WITH WONDERMENT CONCERNING WHAT THE PEASANTS HAVE TOLD HIM ABOUT THE BICYCLE THE PASHA KHAN MAKES HIS APPEARANCE WITHOUT HAVING TAKEN THE TROUBLE
CERTAIN YOUNG MEN BELONGING TO THE NOBLE ARMY OF HANGERS ON ABOUT THE SHEIKH'S APARTMENTS INVARIABLY GLIDE INSIDE AND IMPORTUNE THE GUEST FROM FRANGISTAN FOR ANY ARTICLE OF HIS CLOTHING
RESPECTFULLY SALAAM AND GIVE WAY IT IS THE GREAT PASHA KHAN
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE CONSIDERABLE PRIDE OF LOCALITY IN THE GREAT HOOSIER STATE AND I VENTURE THERE ARE SCORES OF PRETTIEST TOWNS IN INDIANA NEVERTHELESS GOSHEN IS CERTAINLY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE WITH UNUSUALLY BROAD WELL SHADED STREETS
THAN THEY GET ALTOGETHER TOO FAMILIAR AND INQUISITIVE ABOUT MY PACKAGES AND I DETECT ONE VENTURESOME KLEPTOMANIAC SURREPTITIOUSLY UNFASTENING A STRAP WHEN HE FANCIES I AM NOT NOTICING MOREOVER
OR TO PREVENT A CONFLICT BETWEEN US WILL ALWAYS REMAIN AN UNCERTAINTY I AM AFRAID HOWEVER THAT WITH THE ADVANTAGE ON THEIR SIDE THE KOORDISH HERDSMEN RARELY TROUBLE THEMSELVES
I DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO PAY AS LITTLE HEED TO THEM AS POSSIBLE SEEING THAT I HAVE NO INTENTION OF HALTING THEY COME RUNNING UP AND UNDERTAKE TO FORCIBLY DETAIN ME BY SEIZING HOLD OF THE BICYCLE
AND IN ITS FAIR BOSOM REFLECTS BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE VIEWS THAT ARE CHANGED AND REBEAUTIFIED BY THE MASTER HAND OF THE SUN EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY AND DOUBLY EMBELLISHED AT NIGHT BY THE MOON IT IS WHISPERED THAT DURING THE LATE UNPLEASANTNESS
A REGULAR GIBRALTAR IT OCCUPIES THE SUMMIT OF A PRECIPITOUS DETACHED MOUNTAIN PEAK WHICH IS ACCESSIBLE ONLY FROM ONE POINT ALL THE OTHER SIDES PRESENTING A SHEER PRECIPICE OF ROCK IT FORMS A CONSPICUOUS FEATURE OF THE LANDSCAPE FOR MANY MILES AROUND
IS SO DELIGHTFULLY ROMANTIC AT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING JULY SEVENTEENTH I BOWL ACROSS THE BOUNDARY LINE INTO OHIO FOLLOWING THE MERCHANTS AND BANKERS TELEGRAPH ROAD TO NAPOLEON I PASS THROUGH A DISTRICT WHERE THE RAIN HAS OVERLOOKED THEM FOR TWO MONTHS
IN FROLICSOME CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALWAYS HAVING A HOWLING MAJORITY OVER THEIR LESS PROLIFIC NEIGHBORS REFRESHMENTS IN ABUNDANCE ARE TENDERED AND THE USUAL PANTOMIMIC EXPLANATIONS EXCHANGED BETWEEN US
ARE LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE TURKISH BUT SUCH VALUABLE PROPERTY AS MELON GARDENS VINEYARDS ET CETERA
DURING THE COURSE OF TEN MINUTES CONVERSATION THE LADY INFORMS ME THAT SHE IS COMPELLED TO TRAVEL IN THIS MANNER THE WHOLE DISTANCE TO TREBIZOND
AND IT IS DIVIDED INTO COMPARTMENTS SIMILAR TO A PREVIOUS DESCRIPTION THE SHEIKH IS A BIG BURLY FELLOW OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE WEARING A TURBAN THE SIZE OF A HALF BUSHEL MEASURE
PARTICULARLY IN MAKING FILIGREE SILVER WORK TOWARD EVENING MYSELF AND MISTER WEAKLEY TAKE A STROLL THROUGH THE SILVERSMITHS QUARTERS THE QUARTERS CONSIST OF TWENTY OR THIRTY SMALL WOODEN SHOPS SURROUNDING AN OBLONG COURT
BEING CHIEFLY INTERESTED IN SATISFYING MY APPETITE HOWEVER THEIR SILENT OBSERVATIONS HAVE NO EFFECT SAVE TO FURTHER MYSTIFY MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERSIAN CHARACTER THE SECRET OF ALL THIS SOON REVEALS ITSELF
ORDERING A SERVANT TO BRING A TALLOW CANDLE SO THAT I CAN HAVE NO EXCUSE THERE APPEARS TO BE SUCH A TOTAL ABSENCE OF ALL CONSIDERATION FOR MYSELF THAT I AM NOT DISPOSED TO REGARD VERY FAVORABLY OR PATIENTLY
AND HIS TWO GENERATIONS OF DESCENDANTS THE OLD FELLOW IS SEATED ON A ROCK SMOKING A CIGARETTE AND ENDEAVORING TO COAX A LITTLE COMFORT FROM THE SLANTING RAYS OF THE MORNING SUN AND I STRAIGHTWAY APPROACH HIM AND BROACH THE ALL IMPORTANT SUBJECT OF REFRESHMENTS
WATCHING THE FESTIVE MERRY MAKINGS OF THE MEN THEIR HEADS AND NECKS ARE RESPLENDENT WITH BANDS AND NECKLACES OF GOLD COINS IT STILL BEING A CUSTOM OF THE EAST TO LET THE FEMALE MEMBERS OF A FAMILY WEAR THE SURPLUS WEALTH ABOUT THEM IN THE SHAPE OF GOLD ORNAMENTS AND JEWELS
BUT UNFORTUNTAELY THIS IS OLD YAORT YAORT THAT IS IN THE SERE AND YELLOW STAGE OF ITS USEFULNESS AS HUMAN FOOD AND ALTHOUGH THESE PEOPLE DOUBTLESS CONSUME IT THUS I PREFER TO WAIT UNTIL SOMETHING MORE ACCEPTABLE AND LESS ODORIFEROUS TURNS UP
PROM ANGORA I HAVE BROUGHT A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO MISTER ERNEST WEAKLEY A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN ENGAGED TOGETHER WITH MISTER KODIGAS A BELGIAN GENTLEMAN
SUCH IS MY FIRST AUTUMN EVENING BENEATH THE CLOUDLESS SKIES OF PERSIA SOON THE VILLAGE OF OVAHJIK IS REACHED AND SOME PEASANTS GUIDE ME TO THE RESIDENCE OF THE PASHA KHAN
AND BOWLING BRISKLY ALONG THE RIGHT ROAD WITHIN THEIR RANGE OF VISION FOR OVER A MILE
IF SHE WERE ONLY ONCE IN GETTING A DECENT SALARY WEARING THE KIND OF CLOTHES SHE LIKED HAVING THE MONEY TO DO WITH GOING HERE AND THERE AS SHE PLEASED
SHE THOUGHT DESPERATELY UPON THE SUBJECT FREQUENTLY SHE HAD CONSIDERED THE STAGE AS A DOOR THROUGH WHICH SHE MIGHT ENTER THAT GILDED STATE WHICH SHE HAD SO MUCH CRAVED NOW
THAT WE SPEND VERY MUCH MY MONEY IS NEARLY GONE HE SAID AND I HARDLY KNOW WHERE IT'S GONE TO ALL THAT SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ASKED CARRIE ALL BUT A HUNDRED
WAS SWEPT AWAY IT WENT THIS WAY ON EVERY OCCASION DROUET DID NOT LEAVE HER MUCH ALONE SHE HAD TIME FOR SOME LONE WANDERINGS BUT MOSTLY HE FILLED HER HOURS WITH SIGHT SEEING
WITHOUT IN THE LEAST COMPROMISING HIS OWN BEARING AND OPINIONS THERE WERE IN THE LAST PLACE A FEW GOOD FOLLOWERS NEITHER RICH NOR POOR FAMOUS NOR YET REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE WAS FRIENDLY ON THE SCORE OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP
JESSICA MUST HAVE A NEW DRESS THIS MONTH SAID MISSUS HURSTWOOD ONE MORNING HURSTWOOD WAS ARRAYING HIMSELF IN ONE OF HIS PERFECTION VESTS BEFORE THE GLASS AT THE TIME I THOUGHT SHE JUST BOUGHT ONE HE SAID THAT WAS JUST SOMETHING FOR EVENING WEAR RETURNED HIS WIFE COMPLACENTLY
BUT FEELING SOMEHOW THAT HE MUST GO CARRIE'S FIRST CALL WAS UPON MISSUS BERMUDEZ WHOSE ADDRESS WAS QUITE THE NEAREST
CARRIE SHE CALLED CARRIE BUT HER OWN VOICE SOUNDED FAR AWAY AND THE STRANGE WATERS WERE BLURRING EVERYTHING SHE CAME AWAY SUFFERING AS THOUGH SHE HAD LOST SOMETHING SHE WAS MORE INEXPRESSIBLY SAD
THERE HE LEANED OVER THE SPLENDID BAR AND SWALLOWED A GLASS OF PLAIN WHISKEY AND PURCHASED A COUPLE OF CIGARS ONE OF WHICH HE LIGHTED THIS TO HIM REPRESENTED IN PART HIGH LIFE A FAIR SAMPLE OF WHAT THE WHOLE MUST BE
AND WHOSE FATHERS HAD STANDING LOCALLY AS PARTNERS OR OWNERS OF SOLID BUSINESSES THESE GIRLS GAVE THEMSELVES THE AIRS BEFITTING THE THRIVING DOMESTIC ESTABLISHMENTS FROM WHENCE THEY ISSUED THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES OF THE SCHOOL ABOUT WHOM JESSICA CONCERNED HERSELF
NO AGENT WOULD TROUBLE ABOUT YOU FOR LESS THAN THAT CARRIE SAW A LIGHT THANK YOU SHE SAID I'LL THINK ABOUT IT
WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE QUERIED MISSUS HURSTWOOD EDDIE FAHRWAY'S GOT A NEW STEAM LAUNCH AND HE WANTS ME TO COME UP AND SEE HOW IT WORKS HOW MUCH DID IT COST HIM ASKED HIS MOTHER OH OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS HE SAYS IT'S A DANDY
HOW DELIGHTFUL IT WOULD ALL BE HER MIND RAN OVER THIS PICTURE ALL THE DAY LONG HURSTWOOD'S DREARY STATE
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL FUNCTIONS DEVOLVED UPON THE OWNERS
OH NO SAID MINNIE YES COME ON SAID CARRIE SHE BEGAN TO PULL THE BASKET OVER AND NOW IN SPITE OF ALL PROTEST SHE HAD SWUNG OVER AND WAS GOING DOWN CARRIE SHE CALLED CARRIE COME BACK
EVENING THAT HERBERT CRANE TRIED TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH ME WHO IS HE MY DEAR INQUIRED MISSUS HURSTWOOD OH NO ONE SAID JESSICA PURSING HER PRETTY LIPS HE'S JUST A STUDENT THERE HE HASN'T ANYTHING
I STRUCK A LITTLE PEACH COMING IN ON THE TRAIN FRIDAY REMARKED DROUET BY WAY OF PARTING BY GEORGE THAT'S SO I MUST GO AND CALL ON HER BEFORE I GO AWAY OH NEVER MIND HER HURSTWOOD REMARKED
JOHN B DRAKE TO DAY HE SAID HE'S GOING TO OPEN A HOTEL HERE IN THE FALL HE SAYS THAT HE CAN MAKE A PLACE FOR ME THEN WHO IS HE ASKED CARRIE HE'S THE MAN THAT RUNS THE GRAND PACIFIC IN CHICAGO
KEEP A BAROUCHE OR CARRIAGE PERHAPS WEAR FINE CLOTHES AND MAINTAIN A GOOD MERCANTILE POSITION NATURALLY HURSTWOOD WHO WAS A LITTLE ABOVE THE ORDER OF MIND WHICH ACCEPTED THIS STANDARD AS PERFECT
THE LONG BAR WAS A BLAZE OF LIGHTS POLISHED WOOD WORK COLOURED AND CUT GLASSWARE AND MANY FANCY BOTTLES
WHO WAS JUST RETURNING FROM A TRIP FOR MORE CIGARS ALL FIVE NOW JOINED IN AN ANIMATED CONVERSATION CONCERNING THE COMPANY PRESENT AND THE GENERAL DRIFT OF LODGE AFFAIRS WHO'S HERE SAID HURSTWOOD PASSING INTO THE THEATRE PROPER
I'D GET ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED A YEAR OUT OF THAT THAT WOULD BE GOOD WOULDN'T IT SHE SAID SYMPATHETICALLY IF I CAN ONLY GET OVER THIS SUMMER HE ADDED I THINK I'LL BE ALL RIGHT
PARTICULARLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAD NOT YET REACHED BUT HOPED TO DO SO THE DAZZLING HEIGHT WHICH MONEY TO DINE HERE LAVISHLY REPRESENTED YOU DON'T SAY SO WOULD BE THE REPLY WHY
GET YOURSELF FIXED UP SEE THE CITY I WON'T HURT YOU I KNOW YOU WON'T SHE REMARKED HALF TRUTHFULLY GOT ON THE NEW SHOES HAVEN'T YOU STICK EM OUT GEORGE THEY LOOK FINE PUT ON YOUR JACKET CARRIE OBEYED
HERE WAS AN OPEN DOOR TO SEE ALL OF THAT SHE HAD COME UPON IT AS ONE WHO STUMBLES UPON A SECRET PASSAGE AND BEHOLD SHE WAS IN THE CHAMBER OF DIAMONDS AND DELIGHT AS SHE DRESSED WITH A FLUTTER IN HER LITTLE STAGE ROOM
IT WAS ALL RIGHT TO DO IT ALL MEN DO THOSE THINGS BUT WHY WASN'T HE CAREFUL A MAN CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL HE LOST SYMPATHY FOR THE MAN THAT MADE A MISTAKE AND WAS FOUND OUT ON THIS ACCOUNT HE STILL DEVOTED SOME TIME TO SHOWING HIS WIFE ABOUT
INTO WHICH THEY WERE LOOKING THEY COULD SEE THE CURIOUS WET STONES FAR DOWN WHERE THE WALL DISAPPEARED IN VAGUE SHADOWS AN OLD BASKET USED FOR DESCENDING WAS HANGING THERE FASTENED BY A WORN ROPE LET'S GET IN SAID CARRIE
SUCH AN ATMOSPHERE COULD HARDLY COME UNDER THE CATEGORY OF HOME LIFE IT RAN ALONG BY FORCE OF HABIT BY FORCE OF CONVENTIONAL OPINION
THE ONLY INDICATION OF HIS THOUGHTS CAME IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE CLICKING SOUND MADE BY HIS TONGUE THE SOUND SOME PEOPLE MAKE WHEN THEY WISH TO URGE ON A HORSE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE'S GONE TO SAID MINNIE THOROUGHLY AROUSED I DON'T KNOW
HE HAD NOT THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE SO LONG SEEKING WELL HE SAID NOT VENTURING TO ASK WHAT NEWS I DIDN'T FIND OUT ANYTHING TO DAY SAID CARRIE TAKING OFF HER GLOVES
WAS NOT AN UNFREQUENT SALUTATION AT THE DINNER TABLE ALL RIGHT WAS HIS ONLY REPLY HE HAD LONG SINCE WEARIED OF DISCUSSING THE RANCOROUS SUBJECT A LOVELY HOME ATMOSPHERE IS ONE OF THE FLOWERS OF THE WORLD
NO RETURNED JESSICA THEY'RE POOR AS CHURCH MICE SHE DISTINGUISHED VERY CAREFULLY BETWEEN THE YOUNG BOYS OF THE SCHOOL MANY OF WHOM WERE ATTRACTED BY HER BEAUTY
TAKING UP THE CURTAILED CONVERSATION MISSUS GEORGE WHEELER SAID CARRIE MOVING OVER TO WHERE SHE WAS WRITING THE WOMAN WROTE HER ADDRESS IN FULL AND THEN ALLOWED HER TO DEPART AT HER LEISURE
WELL YOU NEVER CAN TELL SAID HURSTWOOD THERE MAY BE SOMETHING TO IT I WOULDN'T BOTHER ABOUT IT MYSELF THOUGH BY THE WAY HE ADDED ARE YOU GOING ANYWHERE TO NIGHT THE HOLE IN THE GROUND
HE LOOKED SO DISCONSOLATE THAT IT SCARED HER SHE BEGAN TO SEE THAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DRIFTING SHE HAD FELT IT ALL THE TIME WELL GEORGE SHE EXCLAIMED
THAT HOPELESS EXAMPLE HAD FALLEN UNDER THE LANCE OF THE DIRECTOR'S CRITICISM MISSUS MORGAN WAS STILL PRESENT BUT ENVIOUS AND DETERMINED IF FOR NOTHING MORE THAN SPITE TO DO AS WELL AS CARRIE AT LEAST
BUT DID NOT FALL HURSTWOOD NOTICED SOMETHING LET ME LOOK TO RECOVER HERSELF SHE WENT INTO THE FRONT ROOM WHILE HE SEARCHED PRESENTLY SHE RETURNED
UNTIL HE COULD GET SOMETHING HE CAME IN ONE DAY WITH SOMETHING OF THIS IDEA IN HIS MIND
SAY THAT FITS LIKE A T DON'T IT HE REMARKED FEELING THE SET OF IT AT THE WAIST AND EYEING IT FROM A FEW PACES WITH REAL PLEASURE WHAT YOU NEED NOW IS A NEW SKIRT LET'S GO TO BREAKFAST CARRIE PUT ON HER HAT
HOMEWARD YOU CAN HELP THE BOYS OUT I GUESS WHAT IS IT
HERE WE ARE SAID HURSTWOOD TURNING TO ONE FROM A GROUP WITH WHOM HE WAS TALKING THAT'S RIGHT RETURNED THE NEWCOMER A GENTLEMAN OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE AND SAY HE WHISPERED JOVIALLY
THE DOOR OF THE HALL BEDROOM OPENED AND FROM IT ISSUED TWO VERY MANNISH LOOKING WOMEN VERY TIGHTLY DRESSED AND WEARING WHITE COLLARS AND CUFFS AFTER THEM CAME A PORTLY LADY
BUT WHATEVER TWINGES OF CONSCIENCE HE MIGHT HAVE WOULD BE RUDIMENTARY
COME ON OUT TO BREAKFAST YOU WANT TO GET YOUR OTHER CLOTHES TO DAY CARRIE LOOKED AT HIM WITH THE HUE OF SHIFTING THOUGHT IN HER LARGE EYES I WISH I COULD GET SOMETHING TO DO SHE SAID YOU'LL GET THAT ALL RIGHT SAID DROUET WHAT'S THE USE WORRYING RIGHT NOW
STANDARDS AND WRITING APPARATUS OF GOLD RICHLY ENAMELLED AND SET WITH JEWELS THE NEXT DAY
HAVING TESTIFIED THEIR SATISFACTION AT THE MARRIAGE OF HIS DAUGHTER WITH NOOR AD DEEN ALI SAT DOWN TO A MAGNIFICENT REPAST AFTER WHICH NOTARIES CAME IN WITH THE MARRIAGE CONTRAST AND THE CHIEF LORDS SIGNED IT
HIS FATHER PUT HIM AFTERWARDS TO OTHER TUTORS BY WHOM HIS MIND WAS CULTIVATED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT WHEN HE WAS TWELVE YEARS OF AGE HE HAD NO MORE OCCASION FOR THEM AND THEN AS HIS PHYSIOGNOMY PROMISED WONDERS
BUT AS HE TREATED ALL HIS COURT THAT DAY MADE HIM EAT AT HIS TABLE ALONE WITH HIM
LOOKING VERY FIERCELY UPON ME AS IF MUCH DISPLEASED
AND TOMORROW MORNING I WILL RETURN TO YOU THIS SAID SHE EMBRACED THE MOTHER AND THE DAUGHTER AND WENT AWAY AS SOON AS SHE CAME TO THE PALACE
AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE ALL THE REASON IN THE WORLD TO BE SATISFIED WITH HER CONDUCT THAT AT LAST I YIELDED I ORDERED PROPER APPAREL TO BE MADE FOR HER AND AFTER HAVING MARRIED HER ACCORDING TO FORM
ARRIVED AT HIS COURT THIS PHYSICIAN HAD LEARNT THE THEORY OF HIS PROFESSION IN GREEK PERSIAN TURKISH ARABIC LATIN SYRIAC AND HEBREW BOOKS HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED NATURAL PHILOSOPHER
AND THOUGH YOU DO NOT DESERVE THAT I SHOULD ENTER INTO ANY EXPLANATION WITH YOU I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE THREE SISTERS WHO TRANSACT OUR AFFAIRS WITH SO MUCH SECRECY THAT NO ONE KNOWS ANY THING OF THEM
AND INTREAT HIM TO GRANT YOU THE REVERSION OF MY DIGNITY OF GRAND VIZIER IN THE KINGDOM OF BUSSORAH IN THE MEAN TIME NOTHING BEING MORE REQUISITE FOR ME THAN EASE IN MY OLD AGE
UPON WHICH HE CALLED AN OFFICER GO IMMEDIATELY SAID HE AND CAUSE TO BE PAID TO THIS MAN OUT OF MY TREASURY ONE HUNDRED PIECES OF GOLD LET HIM HAVE ALSO TWENTY LOADS OF THE RICHEST MERCHANDIZE IN MY STOREHOUSES
HE ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND WE CONVERSED THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT CONCERNING OUR EMBARKATION AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY WE LEFT THE PALACE
NOOR AD DEEN FOLLOWED THE GRAND VIZIER WHO SOON DISCOVERED HIS GOOD QUALITIES AND CONCEIVED FOR HIM SO GREAT AN AFFECTION THAT ONE DAY HE SAID TO HIM IN PRIVATE MY SON
THE KING DID SO AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE THE PHYSICIAN CAME TO HIM WITH THE MACE AND SAID EXERCISE YOURSELF WITH THIS MACE AND STRIKE THE BALL UNTIL YOU FIND YOUR HANDS AND BODY PERSPIRE
THAT THEY KNEW NOT WHAT WAS BECOME OF HIM AND WERE IN MUCH TROUBLE IN CONSEQUENCE I CONCEIVED THAT THE STRANGE EVENT OF THE TOMB WAS TOO TRUE I WAS SENSIBLY AFFLICTED
AND SAID TO THE SULTAN SIR YOUR MAJESTY MUST NEEDS HAVE FORGOTTEN YOURSELF I AM SURPRISED THAT YOUR MAJESTY HAS SENT FOR ME TO APPEAR AMONG MEN HOW DAUGHTER SAID THE SULTAN YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU SAY
TO JUDGE OF THIS CREATURE BY HIS BEAUTY HE WOULD SEEM TO BE AN ANGEL OF THE TERRESTRIAL PARADISE WHOM GOD HAS SENT TO PUT THE WORLD IN A FLAME BY HIS CHARMS
THE TWO PARTS OF THE LION DISAPPEARED WHILE THE HEAD CHANGED INTO A LARGE SCORPION IMMEDIATELY THE PRINCESS TURNED HERSELF INTO A SERPENT AND FOUGHT THE SCORPION WHO FINDING HIMSELF WORSTED TOOK THE SHAPE OF AN EAGLE AND FLEW AWAY
AN OLD MAN LEADING A HIND APPEARED AND DREW NEAR HIM
THIS REBEL VIZIER HAD LONG ENTERTAINED A MORTAL HATRED AGAINST ME FOR THIS REASON
BUT YOU SHALL SEE HER AGAIN AS SOON AS YOU ARE IN A CONDITION TO BEAR THE INTERVIEW YOU NOW STAND IN NEED OF REST AND NOTHING OUGHT TO OBSTRUCT YOUR TAKING IT THE SITUATION OF YOUR AFFAIRS IS ALTERED SINCE YOU ARE AS I SUPPOSE THAT GANEM
CONTINUED EVERY DAY TO LOAD HIM WITH NEW FAVOURS BUT THIS KING HAD A VIZIER WHO WAS AVARICIOUS ENVIOUS AND NATURALLY CAPABLE OF EVERY KIND OF MISCHIEF
WHICH WAS THE ONLY MEANS LEFT ME TO SAVE MY LIFE I CAUSED MY BEARD AND EYE BROWS TO BE SHAVED AND PUTTING ON A CALENDER'S HABIT I PASSED UNKNOWN BY ANY OUT OF THE CITY AFTER THAT BY DEGREES I FOUND IT EASY TO QUIT
THE SEAMEN WERE TAKEN UP SEVERAL DAYS IN UNLADING THE MERCHANDIZE I BROUGHT WITH ME AND EMBARKING
WILL NOT PREVENT YOUR BEING CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED FOR YOUR VIOLENT AND UNJUST PROCEEDINGS HERE FETNAH CEASED HER COMPLAINTS HER SIGHS AND TEARS PUTTING A STOP TO HER UTTERANCE
I KNOW HOW TO REVENGE YOUR PRESUMPTION IN DARING TO PREFER ANOTHER TO ME AND I SWEAR THAT YOUR DAUGHTER SHALL BE MARRIED
HE GAVE HER IN ADDITION AS MUCH AS THE LAW WOULD ALLOW HIM AT LAST THE YEAR EXPIRED AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO DEPART HE PUT HIS BURIAL CLOTHES IN HIS WALLET BUT WHEN HE CAME TO BID HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN ADIEU THEIR GRIEF SURPASSED DESCRIPTION
THEN THE TWO FIRES INCREASED WITH A THICK BURNING SMOKE WHICH MOUNTED SO HIGH THAT WE HAD REASON TO APPREHEND IT WOULD SET THE PALACE ON FIRE BUT WE VERY SOON HAD A MORE PRESSING OCCASION OF FEAR FOR THE GENIE HAVING GOT LOOSE FROM THE PRINCESS
FOR I AM THE YOUNGEST MARRIED AND LEFT ME ALONE SOME TIME AFTER MY ELDEST SISTER'S HUSBAND SOLD ALL THAT HE HAD AND WITH THAT MONEY AND MY SISTER'S PORTION THEY WENT BOTH INTO AFRICA WHERE HER HUSBAND
AS FOR NOOR AD DEEN HE WAS VERY UNEASY ALL NIGHT AND SUPPOSING IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO LIVE LONGER WITH A BROTHER WHO HAD TREATED HIM WITH SO MUCH HAUGHTINESS HE PROVIDED A STOUT MULE
PEOPLE CAME FROM AFAR TO RECOMMEND THEMSELVES TO HIS PRAYERS AND ALL WHO VISITED HIM PUBLISHED WHAT BLESSINGS THEY RECEIVED THROUGH HIS MEANS THE GREAT REPUTATION OF THIS HONEST MAN
AND YOU CANNOT COME TO THAT KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT YOU FIRST UNDERSTAND WHO I AM
HE HAD NOT SLEPT LONG WHEN A GENIE WHO HAD RETIRED TO THE CEMETERY DURING THE DAY AND WAS INTENDING ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM TO RANGE ABOUT THE WORLD AT NIGHT ENTERED THE SEPULCHRE
FOR IF YOU BUY EVER SO LITTLE MORE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO BEAR IT THE LADY LAUGHED AT THE FELLOW'S PLEASANT HUMOUR AND ORDERED HIM STILL TO FOLLOW HER
I DID ALL THAT YOU SAY ANSWERED THE MERCHANT I CANNOT DENY IT IF IT BE SO RESUMED THE GENIE I TELL THEE THAT THOU HAST KILLED MY SON AND IN THIS MANNER WHEN THOU WERT THROWING THE SHELLS ABOUT MY SON WAS PASSING BY
MY LORD SAID THE JEW WHO DID NOT KNOW THE TRUE REASON WHY BUDDIR AD DEEN HAD LEFT THE TOWN YOUR FATHER OF HAPPY MEMORY AND MY GOOD LORD
I MUST OWN THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT HE SAW ME HE PERHAPS DESIGNED TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO ME AND CONCEIVED HOPES OF ENGAGING ME TO ADMIT HIS LOVE I GUESSED AT THIS BY THE EAGERNESS WHICH HE SHEWED IN ENTERTAINING ME
I HAD A SON CALLED GANEM WHO COMING TO TRADE AT BAGDAD HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF CARRYING OFF FETNAH
HE WAS CHAINED TO THE SPOT BY THE PLEASURE OF BEHOLDING THREE SUCH BEAUTIES WHO APPEARED TO HIM EQUALLY CHARMING FOR AMENE HAVING NOW LAID ASIDE HER VEIL PROVED TO BE AS HANDSOME AS EITHER OF THE OTHERS
DEMANDED THE GENIE DID YOU NOT TAKE DATES OUT OF YOUR WALLET
AND TURNING TO AMENE SHE CONTINUED SISTER GIVE HIM SOMETHING MORE THAT HE MAY DEPART SATISFIED MADAM REPLIED THE PORTER IT IS NOT THAT WHICH DETAINS ME I AM ALREADY MORE THAN PAID FOR MY SERVICES I AM SENSIBLE THAT I ACT RUDELY IN STAYING LONGER THAN I OUGHT
THAT SHE FORGOT THE GATE WAS OPENED PRAY SISTER SAID THE BEAUTIFUL PORTRESS COME IN WHAT DO YOU STAY FOR
FOR HE THOUGHT IT PROPER TO SPEAK THUS ON PURPOSE TO SATISFY THOSE TO WHOM HE HAD REFUSED HIS ALLIANCE I AM NOW MY LORDS
AND RESISTING AN ORDER WHICH DISAPPOINTED HER MALICE SHE CRIED OUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING HUSBAND SACRIFICE THAT COW YOUR FARMER HAS NOT A FINER NOR ONE FITTER FOR THE FESTIVAL OUT OF DEFERENCE TO MY WIFE I CAME AGAIN TO THE COW
AND RISING AGAIN SAID COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS AFTER RETURNING YOUR MAJESTY THANKS FOR GANEM I MOST HUMBLY ENTREAT YOU TO CAUSE IT TO BE PUBLISHED THROUGHOUT YOUR DO MINIONS THAT YOU PARDON THE SON OF ABOU AYOUB AND THAT HE MAY SAFELY COME TO YOU
WERE JUST GOING TO BE SACRIFICED WHEN A YOUNG MAN OF HANDSOME MIEN PRESSED THROUGH THE CROWD TILL HE CAME UP TO THE GRAND VIZIER
THE MOON WAS NOW QUITE OBSCURED AND I WAS UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DISCOVERY WHILE I STOOD THERE I COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF DOCTOR DUNCAN'S STORY AND REFLECTING THAT THE DAUGHTER WAS NOW RETURNING THE KINDNESS SHOWN TO THE MOTHER
MISTER BROWNRIGG I SPOKE IN HEAT WHEN I CAME UP TO YOU AND I AM SURE I DID YOU WRONG I AM CERTAIN YOU HAD NO IMPROPER MOTIVE IN NOT MAKING ME ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR PROCEEDINGS YOU MEANT NO HARM TO ME BUT YOU DID VERY WRONG TOWARDS MISTER TEMPLETON I WILL TRY TO SHOW YOU THAT WHEN I AM WELL AGAIN
SHE LED ME TO A SEAT AT THE FARTHER END AND OPENING A DOOR CLOSE BESIDE ME LEFT ME IN THE DARK THERE I SAT SO LONG THAT I FELL INTO A FIT OF MUSING BROKEN EVER BY STARTLED EXPECTATION CASTLE AFTER CASTLE I BUILT UP
I STEPPED BETWEEN HER AND IT PARDON ME MISSUS OLDCASTLE THAT IS THE WAY TO MISS OLDCASTLE'S ROOM I AM HERE TO PROTECT HER WITHOUT SAYING A WORD SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AT CAPTAIN EVERARD HE ADVANCED WITH A LONG STRIDE OF DETERMINATION
IT IS WRONG TO COMPEL AND WRONG TO REFUSE THE PAYMENT OF A CHURCH RATE I DO NOT SAY EQUALLY WRONG IT IS MUCH WORSE TO COMPEL THAN TO REFUSE YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS RETURNED MISTER TEMPLETON
CASTLE AFTER CASTLE FELL TO PIECES IN MY HANDS STILL SHE DID NOT COME AT LENGTH I GOT SO RESTLESS AND EXCITED THAT ONLY THE DARKNESS KEPT ME FROM STARTING UP AND PACING THE ROOM STILL SHE DID NOT COME AND PARTLY FROM WEAKNESS PARTLY FROM HOPE DEFERRED
ONE MORNING I HAD JUST AS I THOUGHT LAIN DOWN ON THE DECK TO BREATHE MY LAST HOPING I SHOULD DIE BEFORE I WENT QUITE MAD WITH THIRST WHEN ALL AT ONCE THE FOG LIFTED
IN THE DAYS TO COME NOBODY I SAID BUT OLD ROGERS UNDERSTANDS ME NOBODY WOULD CARE AS FAR AS MY TEACHING GOES IF ANOTHER MAN TOOK MY PLACE FROM NEXT SUNDAY FORWARD AND FOR MISS OLDCASTLE
BUT WE HAD NOT GONE MANY PACES FROM THE HOUSE WHEN MISS OLDCASTLE BEGAN TO TREMBLE VIOLENTLY AND COULD SCARCELY GET ALONG WITH ALL THE HELP I COULD GIVE HER NOR FOR THE SPACE OF SIX WEEKS DID ONE WORD PASS BETWEEN US ABOUT THE PAINFUL OCCURRENCES OF THAT EVENING
NEITHER IS A PLEASANT WAY OF PRESENTING YOURSELF TO HER CONSCIOUSNESS BUT I WAS HELPED OUT OF THE BEGINNING INTO THE MIDDLE OF MY DIFFICULTIES ONCE MORE BY THAT BLESSED LITTLE JUDY I DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS IN THE ROOM TILL I HEARD HER VOICE
THE MOST REASONABLE IN SUCH MOODS A MAN MIGHT ALMOST BE PERSUADED THAT IT WAS RIDICULOUS TO EXPECT ANY SUCH POETIC ABSURDITY AS THE SUMMER
HOW IS MISTER STODDART THEN NOT WELL AT ALL HE WAS TAKEN ILL BEFORE YOU AND HAS BEEN IN BED AND BY THE FIRESIDE EVER SINCE AUNTIE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM HE IS SO OUT OF SPIRITS IF TO MORROW IS FINE I SHALL GO AND SEE HIM
IT WAS NOT THE DAY THAT MADE ME SUCH AS ITSELF THE WEATHER COULD ALWAYS EASILY INFLUENCE THE SURFACE OF MY MIND MY EXTERNAL MOOD BUT IT COULD NEVER GO MUCH FURTHER
BUT WHEN WE ENTERED HE ROSE HE WAS A MAN OF MIDDLE SIZE ABOUT FORTY WITH SHORT BLACK HAIR AND OVERHANGING BUSHY EYEBROWS HIS MOUTH INDICATED GREAT FIRMNESS NOT UNMINGLED WITH SWEETNESS AND EVEN WITH HUMOUR HE SMILED AS HE ROSE BUT LOOKED EMBARRASSED
AND I DID FEEL VERY READY TO MURMUR LIKE A SPOILT CHILD THAT HAD NOT HAD HIS WAY THINK OF HER THERE AND ME HERE THEN I SAID TO MYSELF AT LAST IT MUST HAVE BEEN SHE THAT PLAYED I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVETH
SAT ETHELWYN READING NEVER LIFTING THOSE SEA BLUE EYES OF HERS FROM THE GREAT VOLUME ON HER KNEE READING EVERY WORD SLOWLY TURNING LEAF AFTER LEAF KNEW THAT SHE WOULD SIT THERE READING TILL
CAPTAIN EVERARD HAS WHAT GRANDMAMMA CALLS A NEAT LITTLE PROPERTY OF HIS OWN FROM HIS MOTHER
AS I HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW IN SOME IMPERFECT MEASURE GOD IS WORSHIPPED AND THE TRUTH IS PREACHED IN IT MOST WILLINGLY WOULD I PAY THE MONEY I OBJECT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE RATE IS COMPULSORY AND THEREIN YOU HAVE OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY
I HAD NOT TO WAIT LONG BEFORE THE DOOR OPENED BEHIND ME NOISELESSLY AND I STEPPED INTO THE DARK HOUSE JUDY TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND LED ME ALONG A PASSAGE AND THEN UP A STAIR INTO THE LITTLE DRAWING ROOM THERE WAS NO LIGHT
I AM SELFISHNESS ITSELF TO SPEAK TO YOU THUS NOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR MISERY TO MAKE YOU LISTEN TO MINE BUT AT LEAST IT WILL MAKE YOU SURE THAT IF ALL I AM ALL I HAVE WILL SAVE YOU BUT I AM SAVED ALREADY SHE INTERPOSED IF YOU LOVE ME
THEN ROUND MINE KISSING US BOTH AND RETURNED TO HER PLACE ON THE SOFA MISSUS OLDCASTLE GAVE A SCREAM AND SUNK FAINTING ON A CHAIR
PARTLY OF A DREAD LEST WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ON TOGETHER AND SO THE ATTEMPT SHOULD RESULT IN SOMETHING UNPLEASANTLY AWKWARD I DARESAY LIKEWISE THAT THE NATURAL SHELLINESS OF THE ENGLISH HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AT ALL EVENTS I HAD NOT MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE
THEY WILL BE AT DINNER THE CAPTAIN AND GRANNIE I WILL LEAVE YOU THERE AND TELL AUNTIE THAT YOU WANT TO SEE HER BUT JUDY DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE HER MISTER WALTON YES I DO MORE THAN YOU CAN THINK THEN I WILL TELL HER SO
THAT LAST TIME I WAS IN CHURCH AND INSTEAD OF THANKING GOD FOR THAT HERE I AM MURMURING THAT HE DID NOT GIVE ME MORE AND THIS CHILD HAS JUST BEEN TELLING ME THAT I HAVE TAUGHT HER TO TRY NOT TO BE SELFISH CERTAINLY I SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF MYSELF
I MEAN WHAT I SAY AND MISS JUDY SPEAKS THE TRUTH FELL TOGETHER FROM HER LIPS AND MINE MISTER WALTON BEGAN MISSUS OLDCASTLE INDIGNANTLY
THAN THOSE OF THE CHURCH AND HER FORMS THE CHURCH WAS HIS GRANDMOTHER NOT HIS MOTHER AND HE HAD NOT MADE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER TILL COMPARATIVELY LATE IN LIFE BUT WHILE I DO NOT SAY THAT HIS INTELLECTUAL OBJECTIONS TO THE CHURCH WERE LESS STRONG THAN THEY HAD BEEN
I SAID MISSUS OLDCASTLE TURNED SLIGHTLY LIVID WITH WRATH SHE WAS ALWAYS WHITE AS I HAVE SAID THE CHANGE I CAN DESCRIBE ONLY BY THE WORD I HAVE USED INDICATING A BLUISH DARKENING OF THE WHITENESS SHE WALKED TOWARDS THE DOOR BESIDE ME
I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT IS HER DETERMINATION TO HAVE HER OWN WAY THAT MAKES AUNTIE AFRAID SHE WILL GET IT SOMEHOW AND SHE SAYS NOW SHE WILL RATHER DIE THAN MARRY CAPTAIN EVERARD THEN THERE IS NO ONE ALLOWED TO WAIT ON HER BUT SARAH
HE HAD MADE HIM ILL I WISH I COULD SEND THE CARRIAGE FOR YOU BUT I CAN'T YOU KNOW NEVER MIND JUDY I SHALL MANAGE SOMEHOW WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS STAYING WITH YOU DON'T YOU KNOW CAPTAIN GEORGE EVERARD
AND I KNOW THE VERY SIGHT OF HER IS ENOUGH TO TURN AUNTIE SICK ALMOST WHAT HAS BECOME OF JANE I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T SEEN HER ALL DAY AND THE SERVANTS ARE WHISPERING TOGETHER MORE THAN USUAL
I DID NOT SUFFER QUITE SO MUCH AS SOME WOULD HAVE SUFFERED DURING SUCH AN ILLNESS BUT I HAVE REASON TO FEAR THAT WHEN I WAS LIGHT HEADED FROM FEVER WHICH WAS A NOT UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY MORNINGS DURING THE WORST OF MY ILLNESS
I WAS YET LEFT ANXIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL THERE WAS NO ONE FROM WHOM I COULD ASK ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE FAMILY AT THE HALL SO THAT I WAS JUST DRIVEN TO THE BEST THING TO TRY TO CAST MY CARE UPON HIM WHO CARED FOR MY CARE
AT LAST I BEGAN TO LOSE ALL HOPE AND STILL I WAS SURE THE SCHOONER WAS SLOWLY DRIFTING MY HEAD WAS LIKE TO BURST AND MY TONGUE WAS LIKE A LUMP OF HOLYSTONE IN MY MOUTH WELL
I AM VERY GLAD JUDY DON'T FORGET WHO CAN DO YOU ALL GOOD THERE IS ONE WHO CAN NOT ONLY SHOW YOU WHAT IS RIGHT BUT CAN MAKE YOU ABLE TO DO AND BE WHAT IS RIGHT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HAVE GOT TO LEARN YET JUDY
BUT PRESENTLY HER EYES GREW CLEARER AND I COULD SEE THE SLOW FILM OF A TEAR GATHERING MISTER WALTON SHE SAID I HAVE BEEN TRYING NOT TO BE SELFISH YOU HAVE DONE ME THAT MUCH GOOD
OLD ROGERS SUMMAT'S AMISS WI PARSON TO DAY HE NEVER WENT BY ME LIKE THAT AFORE THIS WON'T DO YOU JUST GO AND SEE SO I WENT HOME AND TOLD MASTER AND HERE I BE SIR
GLANCING FIRST AT THE TABLE THEN AT ME AND THEN AT MISTER BROWNRIGG AS IF BEGGING SOMEBODY TO TELL HIM WHAT TO SAY BUT I DID NOT LEAVE HIM A MOMENT IN THIS PERPLEXITY MISTER TEMPLETON I SAID QUITTING THE TABLE AND HOLDING OUT MY HAND
WHICH STOOD AT THE DOOR BREATHLESS WITH HASTE I WAS YET ABLE TO CALL OUT PUT THAT TABLE DOWN DIRECTLY AT THE SAME MOMENT MISTER BROWNRIGG APPEARED FROM WITHIN THE DOOR
I COULD NOT DREAM OF HAVING MADE HIM ANY BETTER AND SO I WENT ON BROODING OVER ALL THE DISAPPOINTING PORTIONS OF MY LABOUR ALL THE TIME THINKING ABOUT MYSELF INSTEAD OF GOD AND THE WORK THAT LAY FOR ME TO DO
YOU CANNOT GET MUCH FARTHER THIS WAY WITHOUT WADING A BIT AT LEAST I DON'T WANT TO GO NO FARTHER NOW SIR I CAME TO FIND YOU NOTHING AMISS I HOPE
BUT I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND THE EXPLANATION WHAT MAKES IT HARDER IS THAT ALL THE HUSBANDS AND WIVES IN OUR FAMILY FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS HAVE BEEN MORE OR LESS OF COUSINS OR HALF COUSINS OR SECOND OR THIRD COUSINS
ALLOW ME TO REMARK SAID CAPTAIN EVERARD WITH ATTEMPTED NONCHALANCE
IT IS PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE EASY TO FIND FAULT WITH ITS CHARACTERS THAN WITH THEIRS
YOU ARE MUCH TOO LEARNED I ASSURE YOU FOR MY UNDERSTANDING TACE MADAM ANSWERED MURPHY IS LATIN FOR A CANDLE I COMMEND YOUR PRUDENCE I SHALL KNOW THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR CASE WHEN WE ARE ALONE
A GREAT NOISE NOW AROSE OCCASIONED BY THE PRISONERS ALL FLOCKING TO SEE A FELLOW WHIPT FOR PETTY LARCENY TO WHICH HE WAS CONDEMNED BY THE COURT OF QUARTER SESSIONS BUT THIS SOON ENDED IN THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE SPECTATORS FOR THE FELLOW AFTER BEING STRIPT HAVING ADVANCED ANOTHER SIXPENCE
IT WOULD BE INVIDIOUS AND IS NOWAYS NEEDFUL
A VERY PRETTY GIRL THEN ADVANCED TOWARDS THEM WHOSE BEAUTY MISTER BOOTH COULD NOT HELP ADMIRING THE MOMENT HE SAW HER DECLARING AT THE SAME TIME HE THOUGHT SHE HAD GREAT INNOCENCE IN HER COUNTENANCE ROBINSON SAID SHE WAS COMMITTED THITHER AS AN IDLE AND DISORDERLY PERSON AND A COMMON STREET WALKER
WHAT DO YOU HEAR REITERATED SHE YOU HEAR THE RESENTMENT OF THE MOST INJURED OF WOMEN YOU HAVE HEARD YOU SAY OF THE MURDER BUT DO YOU KNOW THE CAUSE MISTER BOOTH HAVE YOU SINCE YOUR RETURN TO ENGLAND VISITED THAT COUNTRY
THE REMAINS OF THEIR DINNER AFTER WHICH OVER A PINT OF WINE THEY ENTERTAINED THEMSELVES FOR A WHILE WITH THE RIDICULOUS BEHAVIOUR OF THEIR VISITANT BUT AMELIA DECLARING SHE RATHER SAW HER AS THE OBJECT OF PITY THAN ANGER TURNED THE DISCOURSE TO PLEASANTER TOPICS
NO SOONER HEARD THAT THE SUM WHICH HE HAD IN INTENTION INTIRELY CONFISCATED FOR HIS OWN USE
FOR WHICH SHE EXPRESSED GREAT CONCERN SHE HAD SENT HIM THAT GUINEA WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED THE DAY BEFORE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO EXCUSE HERSELF FOR NOT HAVING DESIRED TO SEE HIM AT THAT TIME
SO THAT A BY STANDER WOULD HAVE DOUBTED IN EVERY OTHER ARTICLE THAN DRESS WHICH OF THE TWO WAS THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED FINE LADY AFTER A VISIT OF TWENTY MINUTES DURING WHICH NOT A WORD OF ANY FORMER OCCURRENCES WAS MENTIONED
NO MAN CAN BE WICKED AFTER HE IS POSSESSED BY THE SPIRIT THERE IS A WIDE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DAYS OF SIN AND THE DAYS OF GRACE I HAVE BEEN A SINNER MYSELF
THE KEEPER NO SOONER VIEWED THE PURSE THAN HIS FEATURES BECAME ALL SOFTENED IN AN INSTANT AND WITH ALL THE COURTESY OF WHICH HE WAS MASTER HE DESIRED THE LADY TO WALK WITH HIM ASSURING HER THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE THE BEST APARTMENT IN HIS HOUSE MISTER BOOTH WAS NOW LEFT ALONE
OR AT LEAST FAILURE IN SYMPATHY PRONOUNCES IT ON THE WHOLE UNPLEASING AND REGARDS IT CHIEFLY AS A SEQUEL TO TOM JONES SHOWING WHAT IS TO BE EXPECTED OF A LIBERTINE AND THOUGHTLESS HUSBAND BUT HE TOO IS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THE HEROINE THACKERAY
TO THIS DEMAND ROBINSON ANSWERED WITH GREAT ALACRITY THAT HE SHOULD VERY GLADLY HAVE COMPLIED HAD NOT FORTUNE PLAYED ONE OF HER JADE TRICKS WITH HIM FOR SINCE MY WINNING OF YOU SAID HE I HAVE BEEN STRIPT
AND IN THAT ONE THERE IS THE EIGHTEEN PENCE I TOLD YOU OF HE THEN TURNED UP HIS CLOATHS AND HIS POCKETS ENTIRELY RESEMBLED THE PITCHERS OF THE BELIDES BOOTH WAS A LITTLE STAGGERED AT THIS DEFENCE
NO INDEED SIR ANSWERED BOOTH I KNOW NOTHING OF THE LAW THEN SIR I WILL TELL YOU
I HOPE THE LADY SAID ROBINSON HATH NO SUSPICION OF ANY PERSON HERE I HOPE WE ARE ALL PERSONS OF HONOUR AT THIS TABLE D N MY EYES ANSWERED A WELL DRESSED WOMAN I CAN ANSWER FOR MYSELF AND THE OTHER LADIES
WHOM MISTER ROBINSON REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED ON AN INDICTMENT FOUND AGAINST HIM FOR A MOST HORRID PERJURY BUT SAYS HE WE EXPECT HIM TO BE BAILED TODAY GOOD HEAVEN CRIES BOOTH CAN SUCH VILLAINS FIND BAIL
SO GREAT INDEED WAS HER SIMPLICITY THAT HAD NOT AMELIA BEEN VOID OF ALL SUSPICION OF HER HUSBAND THE MAID WOULD HAVE SOON AFTER BETRAYED HER MASTER ONE AFTERNOON WHILE THEY WERE DRINKING TEA
BLESS ME WHAT AM I TO CLIMB UP ANOTHER PAIR OF STAIRS UPON WHICH AMELIA WHO WELL KNEW THE VOICE PRESENTLY RAN TO THE DOOR AND USHERED IN MISSUS JAMES MOST SPLENDIDLY DREST
THIS IS THE HAND THIS IS THE ARM THAT DROVE THE PENKNIFE TO HIS HEART UNKIND FORTUNE THAT NOT ONE DROP OF HIS BLOOD REACHED MY HAND INDEED SIR I WOULD NEVER HAVE WASHED IT FROM IT
AND IF WE EXAMINE THEIR FAVOURITES WE SHALL FIND THEM TO BE MUCH OFTENER SUCH AS THEY HAVE CONFERRED OBLIGATIONS ON THAN SUCH AS THEY HAVE RECEIVED THEM FROM THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THIS SPEECH WHICH PLEASED THE COLONEL AND HE SAID WITH A SMILE
GOOD WOMAN THE LADY'S A WHORE AS WELL AS MYSELF AND THOUGH I AM SENT HITHER TO MILL DOLL D N MY EYES I HAVE MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY IT OFF AS WELL AS THE LADY HERSELF ACTION MIGHT PERHAPS SOON HAVE ENSUED THIS SPEECH HAD NOT THE KEEPER INTERPOSED HIS AUTHORITY
THE MOST SCRUPULOUS HONESTY WOULD PERHAPS IN SUCH A SITUATION HAVE BEEN WELL ENOUGH SATISFIED IN FINDING NO OWNER FOR THE GUINEA ESPECIALLY WHEN PROCLAMATION HAD BEEN MADE IN THE PRISON
THERE IS BUT ONE CIRCUMSTANCE MADAM WHICH I WISH WAS OUT OF THE CASE AND THAT WE MUST PUT OUT OF IT I MEAN THE CARRYING THE PENKNIFE DRAWN INTO THE ROOM WITH YOU FOR THAT SEEMS TO IMPLY MALICE PREPENSIVE AS WE CALL IT IN THE LAW
AND HAVING DREST HERSELF IN THE UTMOST HURRY LEFT HER CHILDREN TO THE CARE OF HER HUSBAND AND RAN AWAY TO PAY HER RESPECTS TO HER FRIEND WHOM SHE LOVED WITH A MOST SINCERE AFFECTION BUT HOW WAS SHE DISAPPOINTED
FOR AS YOU CANNOT HIDE THE CONSEQUENCES YOU MAKE ME ALWAYS SUSPECT TEN TIMES WORSE THAN THE REALITY WHILE I HAVE YOU AND MY CHILDREN WELL BEFORE MY EYES I AM CAPABLE OF FACING ANY NEWS WHICH CAN ARRIVE
A SCENE OF ALTERCATION NOW ENSUED BETWEEN ROBINSON AND THE LADY WHICH ENDED IN A BOUT AT FISTICUFFS IN WHICH THE LADY WAS GREATLY SUPERIOR TO THE PHILOSOPHER WHILE THE TWO COMBATANTS WERE ENGAGED A GRAVE LOOKING MAN RATHER BETTER DREST THAN THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY
AS WELL PUBLIC AS PRIVATE WHICH AT PRESENT INFEST THE COUNTRY THOUGH THERE IS SCARCE AS I REMEMBER A SINGLE STROKE OF SATIRE AIMED AT ANY ONE PERSON THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THE BEST MAN IS THE PROPEREST PATRON OF SUCH AN ATTEMPT THIS I BELIEVE WILL BE READILY GRANTED
AND PUT AN END TO ANY FURTHER DISPUTE SOON AFTER WHICH THE COMPANY BROKE UP AND NONE BUT HIMSELF MISTER MURPHY CAPTAIN BOOTH AND MISS MATTHEWS REMAINED TOGETHER
IT IS HOWEVER USUAL TO DETECT A LACK OF VIVACITY IN THE BOOK AN EVIDENCE OF DECLINING HEALTH AND YEARS IT MAY BE SO IT IS AT LEAST CERTAIN THAT FIELDING DURING THE COMPOSITION OF AMELIA
YET HE WAS NOT SO EGREGIOUSLY ADDICTED TO THAT VICE AS TO BE TEMPTED BY THE SHABBY PLIGHT OF ROBINSON WHO HAD IF I MAY SO EXPRESS MYSELF NO CHARMS FOR A GAMESTER
IT SURELY APPEARED IN MY MARRIAGE WITH MY AMELIA I KNEW HER IN THE FIRST DAWN OF HER BEAUTY AND I BELIEVE MADAM SHE HAD AS MUCH AS EVER FELL TO THE SHARE OF A WOMAN BUT THOUGH I ALWAYS ADMIRED HER IT WAS LONG WITHOUT ANY SPARK OF LOVE
CHAPTER TEN TABLE TALK CONSISTING OF A FACETIOUS DISCOURSE THAT PASSED IN THE PRISON THERE WERE ASSEMBLED AT THE TABLE THE GOVERNOR OF THESE NOT IMPROPERLY CALLED INFERNAL REGIONS THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR VULGARLY NAMED THE FIRST TURNKEY
THE GENIUS WHICH WAS TO FIND ITS FULLEST EXEMPLIFICATION IN TOM JONES ALREADY DISPLAYING MATURITY AND DO WE NOT TOO OFTEN FORGET THAT A VERY SHORT TIME IN FACT BARELY THREE YEARS
WHERE IN THE BALCONY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WAS PLACED THE INIMITABLE B
THE LITTLE ACTIONS OF THEIR CHILDREN THE FORMER SCENES AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OF THEIR LIFE FURNISHED THEM WITH MANY PLEASANT IDEAS AND THE CONTEMPLATION OF AMELIA'S RECOVERY THREW BOOTH INTO RAPTURES AT LENGTH THEY RETIRED HAPPY IN EACH OTHER
NAY PERHAPS THE WORSE A MAN IS BY NATURE THE MORE ROOM THERE IS FOR GRACE
HE SAID THE REAL VALUE OF THE IRON BOX WAS TOO INCONSIDERABLE TO MENTION BUT THAT HE HAD A CAPRICIOUS VALUE FOR IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE PERSON WHO GAVE IT HIM FOR THOUGH IT IS NOT SAID HE WORTH SIXPENCE
CAME UP TO MISTER BOOTH AND TAKING HIM ASIDE SAID I AM SORRY SIR TO SEE A GENTLEMAN AS YOU APPEAR TO BE IN SUCH INTIMACY WITH THAT RASCAL WHO MAKES NO SCRUPLE OF DISOWNING ALL REVEALED RELIGION AS FOR CRIMES THEY ARE HUMAN ERRORS AND SIGNIFY BUT LITTLE
HIS INNOCENCE MANIFESTLY APPEARED AT THE TRIAL BUT HE WAS BROUGHT BACK AGAIN FOR HIS FEES AND HERE HE HATH LAIN EVER SINCE BOOTH EXPREST GREAT HORROR AT THIS ACCOUNT
YET WAS HE RATHER OVERWARM HAVING THEREFORE NO DOUBT CONCERNING THE PERSON OF THE THIEF HE EAGERLY SOUGHT HIM OUT AND VERY BLUNTLY CHARGED HIM WITH THE FACT THE GAMBLER
AND INDEED IS SOMETHING LIKE WHAT DOCTOR JOHNSON WOULD HAVE BEEN IF HE HAD BEEN RATHER BETTER BRED LESS CROTCHETY AND BLESSED WITH MORE HEALTH MISS MATTHEWS IN HER EARLIER SCENES HAS TOUCHES OF GREATNESS WHICH A THOUSAND FRENCH NOVELISTS LAVISHING CANDOUR AND RECKLESS OF EXAGGERATION
LAID IT IN THE PLACE WHERE HE USUALLY SLEPT AND THEN HID HIMSELF IN THE NIGHT THE DRAKEN CAME AND EACH ONE HIT THE LOG A BLOW WITH HIS HATCHET TILL IT FLEW IN PIECES THEN THEY BELIEVED THEIR OBJECT WAS GAINED AND THEY LAY DOWN AGAIN
SOON AFTER THE DWARF LOOKED GREEDILY ROUND AND SAID OH
AT LENGTH BROAD CEASED TO EXPAND DREW A DEEP BREATH THAT MADE THE WHOLE FOREST TREMBLE AND SHRANK INTO HIS USUAL SIZE YOU HAVE MADE ME RUN AWAY SAID THE PRINCE
SOON THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN WERE SEEN PEEPING OVER THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS THE DOOR BURST OPEN AND FINDING THE PRINCE STANDING ALONE THE WIZARD BROKE INTO PEALS OF WICKED LAUGHTER BUT AS HE LAUGHED A LOUD CRASH WAS HEARD
THE MARBLE FIGURES BECAME MEN ONCE MORE AND TOOK UP THEIR OCCUPATIONS JUST AS THEY HAD LEFT THEM OFF THE HORSES NEIGHED IN THE STABLES THE FLOWERS BLOSSOMED IN THE GARDEN THE BIRDS FLEW IN THE AIR THE FISH DARTED IN THE WATER EVERYWHERE YOU LOOKED ALL WAS LIFE
AND HE AND HIS SISTER WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE WORLD SOON AFFAIRS WENT BADLY WITH THEM SO THEY DETERMINED TO WANDER AWAY TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNE IN PACKING UP THE SISTER FOUND A KNIFE WHICH THE MONK HAD LEFT FOR HIS GODSON
THE OLD MAN LISTENED TO HIM FULL OF SORROW AND THEN HE SPOKE YOU HAVE DONE ILL MY SON TO SEARCH OUT THAT WHICH WAS HIDDEN AND YOU ARE RUNNING TO MEET A GREAT DANGER THIS YOUNG GIRL HAS FALLEN INTO THE POWER OF A WICKED SORCERER WHO LIVES IN AN IRON CASTLE
AND SAID I KNOW WHY YOU ARE HERE VERY GOOD YOU MAY HAVE HER IF FOR THREE NIGHTS FOLLOWING YOU CAN PREVENT HER MAKING HER ESCAPE IF YOU FAIL IN THIS YOU AND YOUR SERVANTS WILL ALL BE TURNED INTO STONE LIKE THOSE WHO HAVE COME BEFORE YOU
IF YOU WERE TRAVELLING ALONE REPLIED QUICKEYE IT WOULD TAKE YOU AT LEAST A YEAR TO GET TO IT BUT AS WE ARE WITH YOU WE SHALL ARRIVE THERE TO NIGHT JUST NOW THEY ARE PREPARING SUPPER THERE IS A PRINCESS IN THE CASTLE DO YOU SEE HER
AND ON THE WAY HE MET A MONK WHO BEGGED HIM FOR A NIGHT'S LODGING THIS THE MAN WILLINGLY GRANTED AND TOOK HIM HOME WITH HIM THERE BEING NO ONE FAR NOR NEAR TO BAPTIZE THE CHILD THE MAN ASKED THE MONK TO DO HIM THIS SERVICE
THE GNATS HAVE STUNG ME HORRIBLY THIS TERRIFIED THE DRAKEN FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT LAZARUS TOOK THEIR BLOWS FOR GNAT STINGS AND THEY DETERMINED AT ANY PRICE TO GET RID OF HIM NEXT MORNING THEREFORE
THREE HEADS WHEN HE COMPLAINED OF COLD THE BLACKSMITH TOLD HIM TO SIT NEAR THE FIRE AND WHEN HE SAID HE WAS HUNGRY THE BLACKSMITH PUT SOME FOOD ON A PLATE AND GAVE IT TO HIM THE DWARF MADE SHORT WORK OF WHAT WAS PROVIDED FOR HIM
WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN NEWLY DUG ON THE SURFACE FLOATED A SILVER CUP WITH A GOLDEN HANDLE BUT AS IT BOBBED ABOUT WHENEVER THE KING TRIED TO SEIZE IT HE WAS TOO THIRSTY TO WAIT ANY LONGER AND KNELT DOWN AND DRANK HIS FILL
THEREUPON LAZARUS TOOK THE LOG THREW IT AWAY AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN IN ITS STEAD TOWARDS DAWN HE BEGAN TO GROAN AND WHEN THE DRAKEN HEARD THAT THEY ASKED WHAT AILED HIM TO WHICH HE MADE ANSWER
AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE CHANGED HERSELF INTO A RIVER THE PRINCE INTO A BRIDGE THE HORSE INTO A CROW AND DIVIDED THE WIDE ROAD BEYOND THE BRIDGE INTO THREE LITTLE ONES WHEN THE SOLDIERS CAME UP TO THE BRIDGE THEY PAUSED UNCERTAINLY
AND SOON LOST HIS WAY AMONG ITS WINDING PATHS AND DEEP VALLEYS HE TRIED IN VAIN TO SEE WHERE HE WAS THE THICK TREES SHUT OUT THE SUN AND HE COULD NOT TELL WHICH WAS NORTH AND WHICH WAS SOUTH SO THAT HE MIGHT KNOW WHAT DIRECTION TO MAKE FOR
HE TOOK UP ONE OF THE GARMENTS AND LEAVING HIS HORSE LOOSE TO WANDER ABOUT THE ADJOINING FIELDS HE HID HIMSELF AMONG SOME WILLOWS AND WAITED IN A FEW MINUTES A FLOCK OF GEESE WHICH HAD BEEN PADDLING ABOUT IN THE SEA APPROACHED THE SHORE
DRANK SOME WATER FROM THE SPRING WHICH ROSE THERE AND FELL DIRECTLY INTO A DEEP SLEEP THE DRAKEN CAME ROUND ABOUT TO EAT HIM BUT THE DOGS FLUNG THEMSELVES ON THEM AND TORE THEM IN PIECES
SUDDENLY HE NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE WINDOWS WAS COVERED BY A CURTAIN OF WHITE SILK HE LIFTED IT AND SAW BEFORE HIM THE IMAGE OF A MAIDEN BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY AND SAD AS THE TOMB CLOTHED IN A WHITE ROBE
WHEN THEY HAD COME TO WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF LAZARUS'S HOUSE HE SAID TO THE DRAKEN STOP HERE IN THE MEANTIME FOR I MUST GO ON IN FRONT AND TIE UP MY CHILDREN LEST THEY EAT YOU
THE LOT OF REMAINING AT HOME FELL FIRST TO THE NUN AND WHEN THE COUNTRYMAN AND THE BLACKSMITH HAD GONE OUT INTO THE WOOD SHE SET TO WORK TIDIED UP THE HOUSE AND PREPARED ALL THE FOOD FOR THE DAY
AND LEFT THE POOR FELLOW MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE NOW WHEN THE BLACKSMITH CAME HOME WITH THE NUN IN THE EVENING AND FOUND NOTHING FOR SUPPER
WHEN THE WIZARD CAME HIS EYES SHOT FORTH FLAMES OF FURY CRIC CRAC WAS HEARD AND ANOTHER OF HIS IRON BANDS BROKE AND FELL HE SEIZED THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND AND LED HER OFF GROWLING LOUDER THAN EVER
ONCE UPON A TIME ALL THE STREAMS AND RIVERS RAN SO DRY THAT THE ANIMALS DID NOT KNOW HOW TO GET WATER AFTER A VERY LONG SEARCH WHICH HAD BEEN QUITE IN VAIN THEY FOUND A TINY SPRING
THIS STONE IS THE PRINCESS LONG SHALL TAKE ME THERE AND WE WILL BE BACK BEFORE YOU CAN TURN ROUND SO LONG TOOK HIM ON HIS SHOULDERS AND THEY SET OUT AT EVERY STRIDE THEY COVERED TWENTY MILES AND AS THEY DREW NEAR QUICKEYE FIXED HIS BURNING EYES ON THE MOUNTAIN
HE FELT IN DESPAIR AND HAD QUITE GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF GETTING OUT OF THIS HORRIBLE PLACE WHEN HE HEARD A VOICE CALLING TO HIM HEY HEY STOP A MINUTE
WHEN HE HAD QUITE FINISHED HE RETURNED TO HIS DEN IN THE EVENING THE ANIMALS ALL CAME BACK
HE COULD NEVER FORGET HIS PROMISE AND EVERY TIME HE LET THE BABY OUT OF HIS SIGHT HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SEEN IT FOR THE LAST TIME HOWEVER YEARS PASSED ON AND THE PRINCE GREW FIRST INTO A BIG BOY AND THEN INTO A FINE YOUNG MAN
LITTLE HARE HOW DID YOU LET YOURSELF BE TAKEN IN LIKE THIS DIDN'T YOU BOAST YOU WERE VERY SHARP YOU UNDERTOOK TO GUARD OUR WATER NOW SHOW US HOW MUCH IS LEFT FOR US TO DRINK
HOW WERE THEY TO KNOW WHICH OF THE THREE ROADS THE FUGITIVES HAD TAKEN
BROAD TOOK HIS STAND BY THE DOOR AND PUFFED HIMSELF OUT SO THAT NOT EVEN A MOUSE COULD SLIP BY AND QUICKEYE LEANT AGAINST A PILLAR WHICH STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR AND SUPPORTED THE ROOF BUT IN HALF A SECOND THEY WERE ALL SOUND ASLEEP AND THEY SLEPT SOUND THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG
AS THEY LEFT THE WOOD BEHIND LONG TURNED TO THE PRINCE AND SAID MY LORD HERE COMES MY COMRADE YOU SHOULD TAKE HIM INTO YOUR SERVICE TOO AS YOU WILL FIND HIM A GREAT HELP WELL CALL HIM THEN SO THAT I CAN SEE WHAT SORT OF A MAN HE IS
AND PASSED OVER GREAT MOUNTAINS AND THROUGH DEEP WOODS AND EVERY TIME THEY MET WITH ANY OBSTACLE THE THREE FRIENDS CONTRIVED SOMEHOW TO PUT IT ASIDE AS THE SUN WAS SETTING THE PRINCE BEHELD THE TOWERS OF THE IRON CASTLE
HE SEATED HIMSELF BY HER AND DETERMINED NOT TO CLOSE HIS EYES THAT NIGHT FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD ESCAPE HIM AND IN ORDER THAT SHE SHOULD BE DOUBLY GUARDED LONG STRETCHED HIMSELF LIKE A STRAP ALL ROUND THE ROOM
AND PROMISED THAT IF HE REMAINED AT HOME NO ONE SHOULD GO HUNGRY TO BED SO THE OTHER TWO WENT OUT INTO THE FOREST AND THE COUNTRYMAN HAVING PREPARED THE FOOD FOR THE DAY
AND TOOK THEM TO HIS SISTER WHO WHEN SHE HAD EATEN THEM DECLARED SHE FELT BETTER WHEN HOWEVER THE DRAKOS HEARD THAT JANNI HAD COME BACK YET A THIRD TIME SAFE AND SOUND HE FLED FOR FRIGHT
AND SHORTENING HIMSELF AGAIN HE TOOK THE PRINCE'S HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND LED HIM ALONG VERY SOON THEY GOT CLEAR OF THE FOREST AND SAW BEFORE THEM A WIDE PLAIN ENDING IN A PILE OF HIGH ROCKS COVERED HERE AND THERE WITH TREES AND VERY MUCH LIKE THE FORTIFICATIONS OF A TOWN
YES YOU KNOW YOUR BUSINESS SAID HE BUT BIRDS NESTS ARE NO USE TO ME I AM TOO OLD FOR THEM NOW IF YOU WERE ONLY ABLE TO GET ME OUT OF THIS WOOD YOU WOULD INDEED BE GOOD FOR SOMETHING OH THERE'S NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT REPLIED LONG
IT IS TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF A GREAT PARK FULL OF STREAMS AND LAKES IF YOU ARE ABLE TO BUILD IT YOU SHALL BE MY FRIEND IF NOT OFF WITH YOUR HEAD THE PRINCE LISTENED IN SILENCE TO THIS STARTLING SPEECH
AND THEN RETURNING TO HIS ROOM SET HIMSELF TO THINK ABOUT THE CERTAIN DEATH THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS QUITE ABSORBED IN THESE THOUGHTS WHEN SUDDENLY A BEE FLEW AGAINST THE WINDOW AND TAPPED SAYING LET ME COME IN
AS THEY WERE HOMELESS THEY DETERMINED TO TAKE UP THEIR ABODE IN THE CASTLE AND THEY ARRANGED THAT ONE OF THEM SHOULD ALWAYS STAY AT HOME AND KEEP HOUSE
GO DARE YOUR FATE AND RETURN TO ME SAFE AND SOUND SO THE PRINCE EMBRACED HIS FATHER MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND SET FORTH TO SEEK HIS BRIDE HE RODE ON GAILY FOR SEVERAL HOURS TILL HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A WOOD WHERE HE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE
THE OLD KING WHO HAD LONG SINCE GIVEN UP ALL HOPE WEPT FOR JOY AT THE SIGHT OF HIS SON AND INSISTED THAT THE WEDDING SHOULD TAKE PLACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
FOCUSING HIS ATTENTION WITH SOME RELUCTANCE UPON THIS BLOT ON THE HORIZON HE DISCOVERED THAT THE EXPLOITER OF RAINBOW WAISTCOATS AND SATIN TIES WAS ADDRESSING HIM I SAY SMITHY SAID BRISTOW HE SPOKE IN RATHER AN AWED VOICE
SIR JOHN MORRISON'S SIGNATURE YES IT CAME IN THE MORNING RATHER LATE MIKE REMEMBERED THE CHEQUE PERFECTLY WELL OWING TO THE AMOUNT IT WAS THE ONLY THREE FIGURE CHEQUE WHICH HAD COME ACROSS THE COUNTER DURING THE DAY
I REGRET TO SEE YOU STILL FLAUNT IF IT IS ONE TITHE AS PAINFUL AS THAT YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHY JERK IT OUT COMRADE BRISTOW
ARE LEAVING THE BANK I AM AWARE OF THAT SAID MISTER BICKERSDYKE DRILY PSMITH PUT DOWN THE GLASS YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD ALREADY HE SAID THAT ACCOUNTS FOR YOUR CALM
WITH HIS STOOL TILTED COMFORTABLY AGAINST THE WALL READING THE SPORTING NEWS FROM A PINK PAPER TO A FRIEND FROM THE OUTWARD BILLS DEPARTMENT WHO LAY LUXURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM DID NOT RANK AMONG MISTER WALLER'S PLEASANTEST MEMORIES
WHY HE SAID IT WAS A FORGERY MUTTERED MISTER WALLER SITTING DOWN HEAVILY MIKE COULD NOT TAKE IT IN ALL AT ONCE HE WAS STUNNED
JACKSON HE SAID MIKE CAME FORWARD DO YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE SLOWLY AND WITH AN EFFORT
FUNNY ASS SAID BRISTOW RESUMING HIS WORK PSMITH GLANCED AT MISTER WALLER AS WHO SHOULD SAY SEE WHAT I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH AND YET I DO NOT GIVE WAY OH ER SMITH SAID MISTER WALLER
HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD WORE A VERY TIGHT ETON SUIT AND HAD THE PECULIARLY LOATHSOME EXPRESSION WHICH A SNUB NOSE SOMETIMES GIVES TO THE YOUNG IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLAIN TO THE MOST CASUAL OBSERVER THAT MISTER WALLER WAS FOND AND PROUD OF HIS SON
I WAS THINKING THAT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT CARE TO COME AND HEAR ME SPEAK NEXT SUNDAY
THE CRY HAS GONE ROUND THE WALLER HOUSEHOLD JACKSON AND PSMITH ARE COMING TO SUPPER AND WE CANNOT DISAPPOINT THEM NOW ALREADY THE FATTED BLANC MANGE HAS BEEN KILLED AND THE TABLE CREAKS BENEATH WHAT'S LEFT OF THE MIDDAY BEEF
A GRAND BAT THAT BOY I SAID SO LAST SUMMER BETTER THAN ANY OF HIS BROTHERS
LITTLE BY LITTLE WE COME TO OURSELVES AGAIN LIFE WHICH WE HAD THOUGHT COULD HOLD NO MORE PLEASURE FOR US GRADUALLY SHOWS ITSELF NOT WHOLLY GREY
WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TURMOIL I COULDN'T WAIT TO HEAR I WAS TOO JOLLY GLAD TO GET AWAY OLD BICK LOOKED AT ME AS IF HE COULD EAT ME
IF THIS SHOULD GET ABOUT THE CLUBS I TELL YOU COMRADE JACKSON NO SUCH CRISIS HAS EVER OCCURRED BEFORE IN THE COURSE OF MY CAREER YOU CAN ALWAYS GET OFF YOU KNOW SAID MIKE HE THINKS OF EVERYTHING SAID PSMITH ADMIRINGLY YOU HAVE TOUCHED THE SPOT WITH AN UNERRING FINGER
AFTER ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES DURING WHICH MIKE'S DISCOMFORT CHANGED TO A DULL RESIGNATION MISTER WALLER SUGGESTED A MOVE TO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE ADA HE SAID WOULD PLAY SOME HYMNS THE PROSPECT DID NOT DAZZLE MIKE BUT ANY CHANGE HE THOUGHT MUST BE FOR THE BETTER
PSMITH DID NOT REPLY WITH A BENEVOLENT SMILE AND A GESTURE INTENDED TO SIGNIFY ALL WOULD COME RIGHT IN THE FUTURE HE SLID THROUGH THE SWING DOORS
AND WHAT MIGHT YOU HAVE BEEN UP TO HE INQUIRED COLDLY THIS MAN SAYS YOU HIT HIM PSMITH WAVED THE MATTER ASIDE PURELY IN SELF DEFENCE HE SAID PURELY IN SELF DEFENCE WHAT ELSE COULD THE MAN OF SPIRIT DO
IT IS TOO TRUE SAID PSMITH I MUST CORRECT MYSELF OF THE HABIT HE WILL BE GETTING ABOVE HIMSELF AND WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING TO JACKSON YOU SPOKE OF YOURSELF AS A SOCIALIST SOCIALISM IS THE PASSION OF MY LIFE SAID PSMITH
THE HEAD OF THE CASH DEPARTMENT WAS AS A RULE MILDLY CHEERFUL ON ARRIVAL AND APT EXCESSIVELY MIKE THOUGHT THOUGH HE ALWAYS LISTENED WITH POLITE INTEREST TO RELATE THE MOST RECENT SAYINGS AND DOINGS OF HIS SNUB NOSED SON EDWARD
AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE DEFINITELY DECIDED THIS MORNING TO ABANDON ALL HOPE OF HIS REFORM
PSMITH RELATED BRIEFLY THE HISTORY OF MIKE'S DEPARTURE MISTER SMITH LISTENED WITH INTEREST WELL HE SAID AT LAST
MISTER WALLER INTERVENED AT THIS POINT I THINK YOU MUST REALLY LET JACKSON GO ON WITH HIS WORK SMITH HE SAID THERE SEEMS TO BE TOO MUCH TALKING MY BESETTING SIN SAID PSMITH SADLY
THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL TO BE SAID FOR THE BAR AS A CAREER PSMITH KNEW HIS FATHER
HOWEVER SAID PSMITH PHILOSOPHICALLY THESE ARE LIFE'S TRIALS AND MUST BE BORNE PATIENTLY A ROUNDABOUT ROUTE
ONE ON EACH SIDE IN DOING SO THE ONE ON THE LEFT TRIPPED OVER MIKE AND BILL
IT WAS THIS TOLERANCE WHICH SOMETIMES GOT HIM INTO TROUBLE WITH MISTER BICKERSDYKE THE MANAGER DID NOT OFTEN PERAMBULATE THE OFFICE BUT HE DID OCCASIONALLY AND THE INTERVIEW WHICH ENSUED UPON HIS FINDING HUTCHINSON THE UNDERLING IN THE CASH DEPARTMENT AT THAT TIME
BUT ALL IS NOT YET LOST YOU MUST RECOLLECT THAT COMRADE BICKERSDYKE SPOKE IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT THAT GENEROUS TEMPERAMENT WAS STIRRED TO ITS DEPTHS HE DID NOT PICK HIS WORDS BUT CALM WILL SUCCEED STORM AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING YET
SUNDAY SUPPER THE CAB TOOK THEM BACK TO THE FLAT AT CONSIDERABLE EXPENSE AND PSMITH REQUESTED MIKE TO MAKE TEA A PERFORMANCE IN WHICH HE HIMSELF WAS INTERESTED PURELY AS A SPECTATOR
AND TO REALIZE THAT HIS BLUNT SPEECH WAS LARGELY DUE TO SHYNESS IN SPITE OF HIS PREJUDICE AGAINST EDWARD
CERTAINLY MY BOY SAID MISTER SMITH SENIOR
HE REMOVED HIS HAT
EXCELLENT WE MUST BE GETTING ON WE MUST NOT MISS A MOMENT OF THE MATCH
REASON SUGGESTED THAT THERE WERE PROBABLY ONE OR TWO KNOCKING ABOUT SOMEWHERE BUT THIS WAS NO TIME TO THINK OF THEM HE EXAMINED THE FUTURE AND FOUND IT GOOD
OH SORRY GASPED MIKE AND REACHING OUT UPSET THE WATER JUG INTO THE OPEN JAM TART THROUGH THE BLACK MIST WHICH ROSE BEFORE HIS EYES AS HE LEAPED TO HIS FEET AND STAMMERED APOLOGIES CAME THE DISPASSIONATE VOICE OF MASTER EDWARD WALLER
BUT IT SEEMED TO ME SOMETIMES DURING OUR FESTIVE EVENINGS TOGETHER AT THE CLUB THAT ALL WAS NOT WELL FROM LITTLE ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE SIGNS I HAVE SUSPECTED NOW AND THEN THAT HE WOULD JUST AS SOON HAVE BEEN WITHOUT MY COMPANY
FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS BILL SURNAME UNKNOWN WAS NOT ONE OF YOUR ULTRA SCIENTIFIC FIGHTERS HE DID NOT FAVOUR THE AMERICAN CROUCH AND THE ARTISTIC FEINT HE HAD A STYLE WHOLLY HIS OWN
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT COMRADE WALLER VERY KINDLY LENT IT TO ME HE SHOWED IT TO ME AFTER SUPPER KNOWING HOW ENTHUSIASTICALLY I WAS ATTACHED TO THE CAUSE HAD YOU BEEN LESS TENSELY WRAPPED UP IN COMRADE PREBBLE'S CONVERSATION
WAS NEVER REALLY HAPPY AND AT HIS EASE EXCEPT IN THE PRESENCE OF THOSE OF HIS OWN YEARS AND CLASS PSMITH ON THE CONTRARY SEEMED TO BE BORED BY THEM AND INFINITELY PREFERRED TALKING TO SOMEBODY WHO LIVED IN QUITE ANOTHER WORLD MIKE WAS NOT A SNOB
WALLER WAS UP ALL NIGHT HE OUGHTN'T TO BE HERE AT ALL TODAY HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING HALF THE TIME HE'S ABSOLUTELY FAGGED OUT LOOK HERE YOU'D BETTER NIP BACK AND DO AS MUCH OF THE WORK AS YOU CAN I SHOULDN'T TALK TO HIM MUCH IF I WERE YOU BUCK ALONG MIKE WENT
HAD NOT HAD TO STAND THE TEST OF SUNSHINE AT PRESENT THE WEATHER BEING COLD AND DISMAL HE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY CONTENTED NOW THAT HE HAD GOT INTO THE SWING OF HIS WORK THE DAYS PASSED VERY QUICKLY AND WITH HIS LIFE AFTER OFFICE HOURS HE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND AT ALL
HOW VERY DISTURBING SAID MISTER WALLER
HE WENT ON AS IF HE WERE ADVISING A FRIEND ON SOME COURSE OF ACTION
THE DOOR WAS OPENED TO THEM BY THEIR HOST HIMSELF SO FAR FROM LOOKING BATTERED AND EMITTING LAST BREATHS HE APPEARED PARTICULARLY SPRUCE HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM CHURCH AND WAS STILL WEARING HIS GLOVES AND TALL HAT HE SQUEAKED WITH SURPRISE WHEN HE SAW WHO WERE STANDING ON THE MAT
MISTER WALLER SHOOK IT WITH ENTHUSIASM I HAVE NEVER LIKED TO SPEAK OF IT TO ANYBODY IN THE OFFICE SAID MISTER WALLER BUT I TOO AM HEART AND SOUL IN THE MOVEMENT YOURS FOR THE REVOLUTION SAID PSMITH JUST SO JUST SO EXACTLY
A BRAINY AND ADMIRABLE STEP SAID PSMITH APPROVINGLY THIS RUGGED HONEST MAN ALL UNUSED TO VERBAL SUBTLETIES SHALL GIVE US HIS PLAIN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED AFTER WHICH AS I PRESUME THIS TRAM LITTLE AS I KNOW OF THE HABITS OF TRAMS
WE ALL HAVE OUR HOBBIES SAID PSMITH JACKSON WASN'T SAYING MUCH HE JOLLY WELL HADN'T A CHANCE OLD BICK WAS SHOOTING IT OUT FOURTEEN TO THE DOZEN I HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED SAID PSMITH TO HEAR COMRADE BICKERSDYKE SPEAK BOTH IN HIS SANCTUM AND IN PUBLIC
THE LONDON BRANCH OF THE BANK WAS REALLY ONLY A NURSERY NEW MEN WERE CONSTANTLY WANTED IN THE EASTERN BRANCHES SO THEY HAD TO BE PUT INTO THE LONDON BRANCH TO LEARN THE BUSINESS WHETHER THERE WAS ANY WORK FOR THEM TO DO OR NOT
I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME MYSELF IN HIS PLACE PSMITH SMOOTHED HIS WAISTCOAT
DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING SO FASCINATING CRIED POLLY PEPPER CLASPING HER HANDS IN DELIGHT AND NOT STOPPING TO SIT DOWN BUT LOOKING ALL AROUND YOU HAD BETTER SIT DOWN ADVISED MOTHER FISHER

WHEN SHE WOULD SHOW HER THE PICTURES SHE SPECIALLY LIKED BUT THEY DIDN'T ANY OF THEM GO TO THE LOUVRE THAT NEXT DAY AS IT HAPPENED IT WAS SO BEAUTIFULLY BRIGHT AND SUNSHINY THAT GRANDPAPA SAID IT WOULD BE WICKED TO PASS THE DAY INDOORS
TOMORROW WE MUST SAY GOOD BY MY BOY AND I HEY WHAT EXCLAIMED MISTER KING SETTING HIS COFFEE CUP DOWN NOT VERY GENTLY OUR VACATION CANNOT BE A VERY LONG ONE SAID TOM'S MOTHER WITH A LITTLE SMILE
CONTINUED TO GAZE AT INTERVALS AT THE LIVING BEAUTY AND MISTER KING AND HIS PARTY WERE ABSORBED IN THE MARBLE BEAUTY AND ADELA WAS RUNNING OVER IN HER MIND HOW SHE MEANT TO HAVE POLLY PEPPER ALL TO HERSELF AT THE VISIT TO THE LOUVRE THE NEXT AFTERNOON
NEVER MIND SAID JASPER LOOKING OVER HIS ARMFUL OF PRESENTS TO INVESTIGATE HIS PAPER OF GRAPES IF WE DON'T LOSE BUT ONE WE'RE LUCKY

I DECLARE I COULD STAY ALL DAY IN ONE SUCH DREAMS OF CLOTHES AND BONNETS YOU NEVER SAW SUCH BONNETS POLLY PEPPER IN ALL YOUR LIFE SHE LIFTED HER HANDS UNABLE TO FIND WORDS ENOUGH AND THE PARKS AND GARDENS I SUPPOSE
AND THE REST OF THE PARTY CROWDED UP AS CLOSE AS THEY COULD THEY ARE HER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING CLOTHES SAID MISSUS FISHER I DO BELIEVE FOR THE OLD WOMAN WAS WORKING FEARFULLY HARD TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND
THEY WERE AT BREAKFAST AND EVERYBODY IN THE VICINITY TURNED AND STARED AT THEIR TABLE DON'T MIND IT POLLY SAID JASPER HER NEXT NEIGHBOUR I WANT TO DO THE SAME THING AND IT WILL DO SOME OF THOSE STARCHED AND PRIM PEOPLE GOOD TO HEAR A LITTLE ENTHUSIASM

TO BE SURE SAID JASPER WELL WE MUST GIVE HER SOME AND THAT'S A FACT THE SMALL GIRL KEPT ON AT A DOG TROT ALONG THE BANK HER EYES FIXED ON THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO TOSSED OUT SUCH MAGIC WEALTH
OF WHICH THEY NEVER TIRED OR RESTING ON THE BENCHES UNDER THE PLANE AND WALNUT TREES OPPOSITE THEIR HOTEL JUST SITTING STILL TO GAZE THEIR FILL UPON THE JUNGFRAU THIS WAS BEST OF ALL SO POLLY AND JASPER THOUGHT
REPLACING IT ON THE BED OF COTTON AND PUTTING ON THE COVER TO LOOK OVER ANOTHER GIFT MISSUS FISHER REGARDED HER KEENLY WELL NOW POLLY SHE SAID DECIDEDLY I SHALL GO DOWN AND GET THAT CHAIN WE WERE LOOKING AT
BUT THE FRENCH PERSON COULD INTERPRET THE EXPRESSION OF THE FACE UNDER THE WHITE HAIR AND HE ACCORDINGLY LEFT A POSITION IN FRONT OF JASPER TO SIDLE UP TOWARD MISTER KING'S SEAT IN A THREATENING ATTITUDE
TOM SAW THE FELLOW SLINK WITH THE MANNER OF ONE WHO KNEW THE INS AND OUTS OF THE PLACE WELL NOW GLIDING AND DUCKING LOW IN THE SPARSER GROWTH NOW MAKING A BOLD RUN AROUND SOME EXPOSED CURVE NOW DASHING INTO A DENSE PART OF THE WOOD

WHAT MAKES IT SO VERY WARM UP HERE WHEN WE ARE ALL SURROUNDED BY SNOW YOU ASK ME A HARD THING SAID OLD MISTER KING WELL FOR ONE THING WE ARE VERY NEAR THE ITALIAN BORDER THOSE PEAKS OVER THERE YOU KNOW FOLLOW MY WALKING STICK AS I POINT IT
AND DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN AND THE HAND WAS WITHDRAWN AND THE GIRL CLATTERED OFF AS FAST AS SHE COULD RUN IN HER WOODEN SHOES I GOT THEM SAID POLLY RUNNING BACK IN TRIUMPH TO JASPER
AND ON THE WINDING SHELTERED PATHS IT'S PERFECTLY LOVELY OFF THERE SAID POLLY AND ALMOST LIKE THE COUNTRY WITH A LONGING GLANCE OFF INTO THE GREEN COOL SHADE BEYOND SO THEY STROLLED OFF THERE

YOU ARE VERY MUCH TO BE ENVIED SIR I CAN'T HELP SPEAKING TO YOU AND TELLING YOU SO SAID A TALL SOBER LOOKING GENTLEMAN EVIDENTLY AN ENGLISH CURATE OFF ON HIS VACATION AS HE CAUGHT UP WITH HIM ON THE ASCENT WHERE THEY HAD PAUSED AT ONE OF THE LOOK OFFS
OR LISTENED TO IN THE SLIGHTEST HE SAID CALMLY ANYBODY WHO WILL TROT ROUND WITH A KODAK HANGING TO HIS NECK BY A VILLANOUS STRAP
AND AS HE COULDN'T BE TURNED FROM IT AND HIS HEALTH IS PRECARIOUS IF HE IS EXCITED WHY THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE ABOUT IT AND THEN HE INSISTED THAT TOM AND I COME OFF FOR A BIT OF A RUN ON THE CONTINENT THE OTHER CHILDREN BEING WITH HIM AND AS MY BIG BOY
ARE PERFECTLY LOVELY CRIED POLLY FEELING AS IF SHE MUST GET AWAY FROM THE BONNETS AND CLOTHES YES
INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION AMID A BABEL OF SOUNDS AND IT WASN'T UNTIL POLLY WAS DRIVING UP IN THE BIG CAB WITH HER PART OF MISTER KING'S FAMILY AS HE CALLED IT THROUGH THE BROAD AVENUES AND BOULEVARDS
LOOKING OUT FROM THE BIG PIAZZA CROWDED WITH THE HOTEL PEOPLE OUT TO THE ROAD IN FRONT WITH EVERY IMAGINABLE TOURIST PASSING AND REPASSING DONKEYS WERE BEING DRIVEN UP EITHER LOADED DOWN TO THEIR UTMOST WITH HEAVY BAGS AND TRUNKS
YOU TAKE YOURSELF OFF COMMANDED MISTER KING IN AN IRATE VOICE TO THE FRENCH INDIVIDUAL OR I'LL SEE THAT SOME ONE ATTENDS TO YOUR CASE NOT UNDERSTANDING THE LANGUAGE ALL MIGHT HAVE GONE WELL
WHEN A HAND CAME IN FRONT OF HER KODAK AND SHE SAW THE GRINNING FACE OF A MARKEN GIRL UNDER ITS POT HOOK OF HAIR AND WITH THE LONG DANGLING CURL ON ONE SIDE
THE LITTLE DOCTOR LEANED BACK IN HIS SEAT AND BEAMED AT HER OVER HIS BIG GLASSES SHE BEGAN TO LOOK RESTED AND YOUNG ALREADY THIS JOURNEY IS THE VERY THING HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF AND HIS HARD WORKED HAND SLIPPED ITSELF OVER HER TOIL WORN ONE
OH DID IT HURT YOU CRIED POLLY IN DISTRESS RUNNING ACROSS THE PATH TO WALK BY HIS SIDE NOT A BIT SAID TOM I TRIED TO FIND SOME TO PAY YOU BACK AND THEN WE HAD TO FLY FOR THE CARS THE PLAIN QUIET FACE UNDER THE ENGLISH BONNET TURNED TO MISSUS FISHER
AND THEN DEVOTED HER WHOLE TIME AND ENERGY TO THE DISPLAY OF THE GARMENTS AND SHE EVEN LAUGHED ALOUD WHEN OLD MISTER KING PUT SOME COINS IN HER HARD HAND
AND TOOK SEVERAL HASTY STRIDES UP AND DOWN THE PIAZZA WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT PHRONSIE HE SAID COMING BACK TO GET ASTRIDE THE RAILING AGAIN THIS TIME HE TURNED A COLD SHOULDER ON PHRONSIE'S WHITE NEEDLE NOW TO MORROW WE'LL HAVE NO END OF FUN
IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONG AND THAT IF WE DO NOT MOLEST THEM IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID SO THAT BESIDES EXTENDING OUR EMPIRE WE SHOULD GAIN IN SECURITY BY YOUR SUBJECTION
MAKING IT HIS AIM NOW TO KEEP ON THE DEFENSIVE AND TO AVOID ANY UNNECESSARY DANGER
A CORINTHIAN HELD THE INTERVENING SPACE AND BLOCKED UP THE ENTRANCE THE ATHENIANS UNDER DIPHILUS NOW SAILED OUT AGAINST THEM WITH THIRTY THREE SHIPS FROM NAUPACTUS AND THE CORINTHIANS
ABOUT TWO MILES AND A QUARTER FROM ERINEUS THE CORINTHIAN STATION THIS WAS THE TERMINATION
AS ALREADY COMING TO PASS AND AS YOU HAVE STAKED MOST ON AND TRUSTED MOST IN
FAR FROM PERMITTING MYSELF TO DERIVE IT FROM THE FIRST SOURCE THAT CAME TO HAND I DID NOT EVEN TRUST MY OWN IMPRESSIONS BUT IT RESTS PARTLY ON WHAT I SAW MYSELF PARTLY ON WHAT OTHERS SAW FOR ME THE ACCURACY OF THE REPORT BEING ALWAYS TRIED BY THE MOST SEVERE AND DETAILED TESTS POSSIBLE
MEANWHILE THE ATHENIANS RECOVERING FROM THE CONFUSION INTO WHICH THEY HAD
IF ONLY FOR VERY SHAME TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR KINDRED OUR CONFIDENCE THEREFORE AFTER ALL IS NOT SO UTTERLY IRRATIONAL ATHENIANS
AND WERE INVITED AS ALLIES INTO THE OTHER CITIES THAT ONE BY ONE THEY GRADUALLY ACQUIRED FROM THE CONNECTION THE NAME OF HELLENES
THEIR PLAN BEING TO FREE ANTANDRUS AND THE REST OF THE ACTAEAN TOWNS FORMERLY OWNED BY MITYLENE BUT NOW HELD BY THE ATHENIANS ONCE FORTIFIED THERE THEY WOULD HAVE EVERY FACILITY FOR SHIP BUILDING FROM THE VICINITY OF IDA AND THE CONSEQUENT ABUNDANCE OF TIMBER
AND HELPING THEIR ENEMIES ATHENIANS THEN YOU DO NOT ADOPT THE VIEW THAT EXPEDIENCY GOES WITH SECURITY WHILE JUSTICE AND HONOUR CANNOT BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT DANGER
UNLESS THE TERMS BE EQUAL BUT WE TRUST THAT THE GODS MAY GRANT US FORTUNE AS GOOD AS YOURS SINCE WE ARE JUST MEN FIGHTING AGAINST UNJUST
THE STREAM OF FIRE ISSUED FROM ETNA AS ON FORMER OCCASIONS AND DESTROYED SOME LAND OF THE CATANIANS WHO LIVE UPON MOUNT ETNA WHICH IS THE LARGEST MOUNTAIN IN SICILY FIFTY YEARS IT IS SAID HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE LAST ERUPTION THERE HAVING BEEN THREE IN ALL SINCE THE HELLENES HAVE INHABITED SICILY
NOR INDEED WOULD THEY HAVE DONE SO NOW IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN PRESSED BY A WAR WITH THE HIPPONIANS AND MEDMAEANS WHO LIVED ON THEIR BORDER AND WERE COLONISTS OF THEIRS PHAEAX MEANWHILE
LED THEM AGAINST MYCALESSUS THE NIGHT HE PASSED UNOBSERVED NEAR THE TEMPLE OF HERMES NOT QUITE TWO MILES FROM MYCALESSUS AND AT DAYBREAK ASSAULTED AND TOOK THE TOWN WHICH IS NOT A LARGE ONE THE INHABITANTS BEING OFF THEIR GUARD AND NOT EXPECTING THAT ANY ONE WOULD EVER COME UP
AND FIRST TELL US IF THIS PROPOSITION OF OURS SUITS YOU THE MELIAN COMMISSIONERS ANSWERED MELIANS TO THE FAIRNESS OF QUIETLY INSTRUCTING EACH OTHER AS YOU PROPOSE
THAT IT WAS A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM HAVING SO LARGE AN ARMY ASSEMBLED TO ATTACK THE AETOLIANS WHO WERE NOT ONLY THE ENEMIES OF NAUPACTUS BUT WHOSE REDUCTION WOULD FURTHER MAKE IT EASY TO GAIN THE REST OF THAT PART OF THE CONTINENT FOR THE ATHENIANS THE AETOLIAN NATION ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS AND WARLIKE
THEY SEEM TO HAVE TURNED TO CULTIVATION OF THE CHERSONESE AND TO PIRACY FROM WANT OF SUPPLIES THIS WAS WHAT REALLY ENABLED THE TROJANS TO KEEP THE FIELD FOR TEN YEARS AGAINST THEM THE DISPERSION OF THE ENEMY MAKING THEM ALWAYS A MATCH FOR THE DETACHMENT LEFT BEHIND
OF GYLIPPUS AND THE SYRACUSANS FORMED IN ORDER OF BATTLE GYLIPPUS HALTED AT A SHORT DISTANCE OFF AND SENT ON A HERALD TO TELL THEM THAT IF THEY WOULD EVACUATE SICILY WITH BAG AND BAGGAGE WITHIN FIVE DAYS TIME HE WAS WILLING TO MAKE A TRUCE ACCORDINGLY
THE BOMIENSIANS AND CALLIENSIANS WHO EXTEND TOWARDS THE MALIAN GULF BEING AMONG THE NUMBER THE MESSENIANS HOWEVER ADHERED TO THEIR ORIGINAL ADVICE ASSURING DEMOSTHENES THAT THE AETOLIANS WERE AN EASY CONQUEST THEY URGED HIM TO PUSH ON AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE
WHICH LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT SHAME WILL MAKE THEM HELP YOU HERE WE BLESS YOUR SIMPLICITY BUT DO NOT ENVY YOUR FOLLY THE LACEDAEMONIANS WHEN THEIR OWN INTERESTS OR THEIR COUNTRY'S LAWS ARE IN QUESTION
AND SENT FOR TROOPS TO THE ALLIES AND MEANWHILE GOT TOGETHER MONEY SHIPS AND HEAVY INFANTRY AT HOME THE ATHENIANS ALSO SENT TWENTY VESSELS ROUND PELOPONNESE TO PREVENT ANY ONE CROSSING OVER TO SICILY FROM CORINTH OR PELOPONNESE
BUT BADE THEM STATE THE OBJECT OF THEIR MISSION TO THE MAGISTRATES AND THE FEW UPON WHICH THE ATHENIAN ENVOYS SPOKE AS FOLLOWS ATHENIANS SINCE THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT TO GO ON BEFORE THE PEOPLE
AFTER THIS ARRIVING AT ZACYNTHUS AND CEPHALLENIA HE TOOK A BODY OF HEAVY INFANTRY ON BOARD AND SENDING FOR SOME OF THE MESSENIANS
BUT THE OLD TOWNS ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT PREVALENCE OF PIRACY WERE BUILT AWAY FROM THE SEA WHETHER ON THE ISLANDS OR THE CONTINENT AND STILL REMAIN IN THEIR OLD SITES FOR THE PIRATES USED TO PLUNDER ONE ANOTHER
BY WHICH HE HOPED TO ACHIEVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THE WAR NOT UNWORTHY OF THE RISK WITH HIM HERMOCRATES ACTIVELY JOINED IN TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HIS COUNTRYMEN TO ATTACK THE ATHENIANS AT SEA
WHERE THEY TOOK ON BOARD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
A FORTRESS ON THE ATHENIAN BORDER
THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ALLOWED IN DANGER TO INVOKE WHAT IS FAIR AND RIGHT AND EVEN TO PROFIT BY ARGUMENTS NOT STRICTLY VALID IF THEY CAN BE GOT TO PASS CURRENT AND YOU ARE AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THIS AS ANY
OF EXHAUSTING ALL OUR STRENGTH UPON THE BLOCKADE
WHEN IT MAKES YOU THE MODERATE OFFER OF BECOMING ITS TRIBUTARY ALLY WITHOUT CEASING TO ENJOY THE COUNTRY THAT BELONGS TO YOU NOR WHEN YOU HAVE THE CHOICE GIVEN YOU BETWEEN WAR AND SECURITY
AND SECONDLY THE ATHENIANS FOR WANT OF ROOM WOULD BE UNABLE TO USE THEIR FAVOURITE MANOEUVRE OF BREAKING THE LINE OR OF SAILING ROUND AS THE SYRACUSANS WOULD DO THEIR BEST NOT TO LET THEM DO THE ONE AND WANT OF ROOM WOULD PREVENT THEIR DOING THE OTHER
AND WE HAVE AMEINOCLES A CORINTHIAN SHIPWRIGHT MAKING FOUR SHIPS FOR THE SAMIANS DATING FROM THE END OF THIS WAR IT IS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
AND A HAND TO HAND FIGHT ENSUED BETWEEN THE LINES WHERE THE SYRACUSAN CAVALRY COULD BE OF NO USE AND THE SYRACUSANS AND THEIR ALLIES WERE DEFEATED AND TOOK UP THEIR DEAD UNDER TRUCE WHILE THE ATHENIANS ERECTED A TROPHY
OR OF ANY VIGOROUS ACTION OF THEIR OWN BUT AT LAST A TIME CAME WHEN THE TYRANTS OF ATHENS AND THE FAR OLDER TYRANNIES OF THE REST OF HELLAS WERE
HERE ALSO CONON CAME TO THEM THE COMMANDER AT NAUPACTUS WITH NEWS THAT THE TWENTY FIVE CORINTHIAN SHIPS STATIONED OPPOSITE TO HIM FAR FROM GIVING OVER THE WAR WERE MEDITATING AN ENGAGEMENT
AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT THE PROPOSED TOWN WOULD LIE CONVENIENTLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE WAR AGAINST THE ATHENIANS
AND FANCYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO RETIRE
WHICH HE HAD BEEN PUT TO TO TO ARM THEM HE THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE LESS CHANCE OF BEATING HIM THAN BY NOT LETTING HIM HAVE A SIGHT OF THEM AND THUS LEARN HOW GOOD A RIGHT HE HAD TO DESPISE THEM
QUICK SOMEONE AND OPEN THE GATES I SPOKE OF AND LET US BE OUT AND AT THEM WITH NO FEARS FOR THE RESULT ACCORDINGLY ISSUING OUT BY THE PALISADE GATE AND BY THE FIRST IN THE LONG WALL THEN EXISTING
WITH A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND SOMEONE TO SUCCEED ME AS A DISEASE IN THE KIDNEYS UNFITS ME FOR RETAINING MY POST I HAVE I THINK SOME CLAIM ON YOUR INDULGENCE
NIGHT CAME ON WHILE THESE HORRORS WERE ENACTING AND MOST OF IT HAD PASSED BEFORE THEY WERE CONCLUDED
A SORT OF ISTHMUS TO WHICH THE HELOTS
THIS CHARGING PROW TO PROW WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN THOUGHT WANT OF SKILL IN A HELMSMAN WOULD BE THE SYRACUSANS CHIEF MANOEUVRE AS BEING THAT WHICH THEY SHOULD FIND MOST USEFUL
HE RAN AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED ALONG THE STRAIGHT ROAD WHERE THE TROPHY NOW STANDS AS YOU GO BY THE STEEPEST PART OF THE HILL AND FELL UPON AND ROUTED THE CENTRE OF THE ATHENIANS PANIC STRICKEN BY THEIR OWN DISORDER AND ASTOUNDED AT HIS AUDACITY
IN FINE I HAVE WRITTEN MY WORK NOT AS AN ESSAY WHICH IS TO WIN THE APPLAUSE OF THE MOMENT BUT AS A POSSESSION FOR ALL TIME THE MEDIAN WAR THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT OF PAST TIMES YET FOUND A SPEEDY DECISION IN TWO ACTIONS BY SEA AND TWO BY LAND
WHICH ALL THE MEN AT THE OAR ARE BOWMEN NOW IT IS IMPROBABLE THAT MANY SUPERNUMERARIES SAILED IF WE EXCEPT THE KINGS AND HIGH OFFICERS ESPECIALLY AS THEY HAD TO CROSS THE OPEN SEA WITH MUNITIONS OF WAR IN SHIPS
AND THE FIRST PERSON KNOWN TO US BY TRADITION AS HAVING ESTABLISHED A NAVY IS MINOS HE MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF WHAT IS NOW CALLED THE HELLENIC SEA AND RULED OVER THE CYCLADES INTO MOST OF WHICH
SO THAT MUCH HAD TO BE DONE AND MANY YEARS HAD TO ELAPSE BEFORE HELLAS COULD ATTAIN TO A DURABLE TRANQUILLITY UNDISTURBED BY REMOVALS AND COULD BEGIN TO SEND OUT COLONIES AS ATHENS DID TO IONIA AND MOST OF THE ISLANDS
OCCUPIED WITH THESE REFLECTIONS I HAD FAILED TO OBSERVE THAT THE COMPANY HAD GRADUALLY BEEN DRIFTING AWAY UNTIL BUT ONE PERSON WAS LEFT WITH ME
AND LIKE EDRA TENDER EYED I DO NOT ASPIRE OR DESIRE TO MARRY BOTH ESPECIALLY IF I SHOULD LIKE JACOB HAVE TO BEGIN WITH THE WRONG ONE HOWEVER TENDER EYED
DO YOU WISH TO CONFINE YOURSELF TO THE FINISHING OF SOME WORK IN A PARTICULAR LINE AS WOOD CARVING OR STONE METAL CLAY OR GLASS WORK OR IN MAKING OR USING COLORS
NO NO MY VENERABLE FRIEND THAT WAS ALL EXCELLENT ACTING ABOUT MY EXTRAORDINARY DELUSIONS AND THE REST OF IT BUT I AM NOT GOING TO BE CARRIED SO FAR BY THEM AS TO ADHERE TO SUCH AN OUTRAGEOUSLY ONE SIDED BARGAIN PRESENTLY
SHOULD BE RECOMPENSED BUT IT IS A LIGHT OFFENSE NOT LIKE ONE COMMITTED AGAINST THE HOUSE OR EVEN AGAINST ANOTHER PERSON AND WE ALSO REMEMBER THE OCCASION OF IT SINCE IT WAS NO UNWORTHY MOTIVE BUT EXCEEDING LOVE WHICH CLOUDED YOUR JUDGMENT AND THEREFORE
ROLLED OUT THEN UNFOLDING THE PAPERS I DISCOVERED THREE FIVE POUND BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES SURELY THIS IS VERY LITTLE FOR ME TO HAVE ABOUT ME SAID I FEELING GREATLY DISAPPOINTED
AND SOME WERE CONVERSING THE SOUND COMING TO ME LIKE A FAINT MURMUR FROM A DISTANCE AT ONE SIDE SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE CENTER OF THE ROOM THERE WAS A BROAD RAISED PLACE OR DAIS WITH A COUCH ON IT ON WHICH THE FATHER WAS RECLINING AT HIS EASE
I NEVER HEARD SUCH OUTRAGEOUS NONSENSE IN MY LIFE SHE WAS DISTURBED AT THIS OUTBURST BUT QUIETLY AND GRAVELY REPEATED THAT I MUST CERTAINLY BE PUNISHED FOR MY ILLNESS
BUT IN A SPACIOUS APARTMENT NEW TO ME ON A COMFORTABLE BED BESIDE WHICH EDRA WAS SEATED ALMOST MY FIRST FEELING WAS ONE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AT NOT SEEING YOLETTA THERE AND PRESENTLY I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT IN THE RAVINGS OF DELIRIUM
THEN WISHING TO MAKE A FRESH START I ADDED BUT I AM SO GLAD TO HEAR YOU CALL ME SMITH IT MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE PLEASANT AND HOMELIKE TO BE TREATED WITHOUT FORMALITY IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU I'M SURE
AND IN ITS GOING GIVES NEW VIGOR TO THE STRONG THAT HAVE YET MANY DAYS TO LIVE THUS ALSO DOES THE EVER LIVING EARTH FROM THE DUST OF DEAD GENERATIONS OF LEAVES RE MAKE A FRESH FOLIAGE AND FOR HERSELF A NEW GARMENT
WHAT HAD I TO GIVE IN RETURN FOR SUCH A BOON AS THAT ONLY THAT STRENGTH CONCERNING WHICH MY VENERABLE HOST HAD SPOKEN SOMEWHAT ENCOURAGINGLY HE HAD ALSO BEEN SO GOOD AS TO MENTION MY SKILL
WE ONLY OF ALL THINGS HAVING LIFE BEING LIKE THE FATHER SLAY NOT NOR ARE SLAIN AND ARE WITHOUT ENEMIES IN THE EARTH FOR EVEN THE LOWER KINDS WHICH HAVE NOT REASON KNOW WITHOUT REASON THAT WE ARE HIGHEST ON THE EARTH AND
AND TO HAVE BECOME PSYCHICAL AS WELL AS PHYSICAL FOR IN THAT TYPE WHICH IS ONLY FOR A WHILE INFERIOR TO THE ANGELS THE FONDNESS FOR THIS KIND OF OUTER COVERING IS A STRONG INERADICABLE PASSION
IT HAD AN ANCIENT MUSTY SMELL LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT ME BUT SEEMED PRETTY HEAVY AND WELL FILLED AND I PROCEEDED TO OPEN IT AND TURN THE CONTENTS ON THE TABLE ELEVEN BRIGHT SOVEREIGNS AND THREE HALF CROWNS OR FLORINS I FORGET WHICH
IT STRUCK ME THAT MY HOST QUIETLY OBSERVANT HAD WHEN PROPOSING TERMS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE QUANTITY OF FOOD NECESSARY FOR MY SUSTENANCE I REGRETTED TOO LATE THAT I HAD NOT EXERCISED MORE RESTRAINT BUT THE HUNGRY MAN DOES NOT AND CANNOT CONSIDER CONSEQUENCES
WAS IT A VERY CONTEMPTIBLE AMBITION ON MY PART IS IT SINFUL TO WISH FOR ANY ADORNMENTS OTHER THAN WISDOM AND SOBRIETY A MEEK AND LOVING SPIRIT GOOD WORKS AND OTHER THINGS OF THE KIND
AND AS THESE ARE THE MOST AGREEABLE TO THE WORKER IT WOULD PLEASE US MORE TO HAVE YOU LABOR IN THE FIELDS THAN IN THE WORKHOUSE I AM STRONG I ANSWERED AND WILL GLADLY UNDERTAKE LABOR OF THE KIND YOU SPEAK OF THERE IS HOWEVER ONE DIFFICULTY
AND SHOWS AT PRESENT NO SIGN OF BECOMING OBSOLETE MOREOVER THAT FIRST CORRELATION NAMELY MILK GLANDS AND A HAIRY COVERING APPEARS TO HAVE ENTERED THE VERY SOUL OF CREATURES OF THIS CLASS
AND LIKE ONE WHO FORGETTING THE LIMITS THAT ARE SET TO HIS FACULTIES GAZES STEADFASTLY ON THE SUN BY SEEING MUCH THEY BECOME AFFLICTED WITH BLINDNESS BUT THEY KNOW NOT THEIR POVERTY AND BLINDNESS AND WERE NOT SATISFIED
COMMON AND BROAD ENOUGH OF OUR HUMAN FEELINGS ESPECIALLY THE SWEET AND IMPORTANT FEELING OF LOVE BUT HOW WAS I TO LEAD UP TO IT THE WORK SHE WAS ENGAGED WITH AT LENGTH SUGGESTED AN OPENING AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A PRETTY LITTLE SPEECH
YOU HAD ACCOMPLISHED A TASK WHICH IN ANOTHER AND CALMER CONDITION OF MIND AND BODY
IN THUS ACTING YOU HAD ALREADY BEEN GUILTY OF A SERIOUS OFFENSE AGAINST YOURSELF BUT EVEN THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED THE CONSEQUENCES IF AFTER FINISHING YOUR WORK YOU HAD RESTED AND REFRESHED YOURSELF WITH FOOD AND DRINK
AND YET I CONTINUED SOME PEOPLE HOLD THAT WOMEN OUGHT NOT TO HAVE THE FRANCHISE OR SUFFRAGE OR WHATEVER IT IS NOT THAT I CARE TWO STRAWS ABOUT THE QUESTION MYSELF AND I ONLY HOPE THEY'LL NEVER GET IT BUT THEN I THINK IT IS SO ILLOGICAL
BUT THE DESPONDENCE AND SULLEN RAGE INTO WHICH I HAD BEEN THROWN MADE ME PROOF EVEN AGAINST THE MEDICINE OF AN ADMONITION IMPARTED SO GENTLY AND TURNING MY FACE AWAY I STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO MAKE ANY REPLY
A LITTLE WHILE AGO YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU LOVED ME HAS THAT FEELING FADED SO SOON OR DO YOU TAKE ANY PLEASURE IN WOUNDING THOSE YOU LOVE HER WORDS AND MORE THAN HER WORDS HER TENDER PLEADING TONE PIERCED ME WITH COMPUNCTION AND I COULD NOT RESIST
THAT THEY MOST DIFFERED FROM OTHERS THE READING I HAVE SAID HAD STRUCK ME AS ALMOST OF THE NATURE OF A RELIGIOUS SERVICE NEVERTHELESS EVERYTHING WENT ON AS BEFORE READING WORKING AND OCCASIONAL CONVERSATION
AND SOMETIMES WHEN RECALLING THE PAST I SEEMED TO BE THINKING ABOUT ANCIENT HISTORY
AND ONLY SAID HOW SWEETLY YOU TALK YOLETTA YOU ARE AS WISE AS YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL I COULD WISH FOR NO GREATER PLEASURE THAN TO SIT HERE LISTENING TO YOU THE WHOLE EVENING AH THEN I AM SORRY I MUST LEAVE YOU NOW SHE ANSWERED
I REMEMBERED TWO THINGS DIVINE YOLETTA WAS THE FIRST AND THE SECOND WAS THAT THOUGHT OF THE RARE PLEASURE IT WOULD BE TO ARRAY MYSELF IN THOSE SAME BARBAROUS RAGS AS I HAD BLASPHEMOUSLY CALLED THEM
BESIDE THE COUCH STOOD A LECTERN ON WHICH A LARGE VOLUME RESTED AND BEFORE HIM THERE WAS A BRASS BOX OR CABINET AND BEHIND THE COUCH SEVEN POLISHED BRASS GLOBES WERE RANGED SUSPENDED ON AXLES RESTING ON BRONZE FRAMES THESE GLOBES VARIED IN SIZE
ON ONE SIDE WITH A ROUGHLY EXECUTED FIGURE OF A WOMAN'S HEAD
OR TO BE CONFRONTED WITH THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ANYHOW A YEAR COULD NOT MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE
AND FIND OUT BY READING ALL ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THIS PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THEIR IDEAS CONCERNING THE HOUSE WHICH APPEARED TO BE AN OBJECT OF ALMOST RELIGIOUS REGARD WITH THEM THIS WOULD MAKE ME QUITE INDEPENDENT
SO THAT THE HUNGRY MAN WILL DEVOUR ACRID FRUITS AND POISONOUS HERBS FOR ALIMENT
THEN EDRA BEGAN TO SPEAK AGAIN AND GRAVELY AND SORROWFULLY BUT WITHOUT A TOUCH OF AUSTERITY IN HER TONE OR MANNER CENSURED ME FOR MAKING USE OF SUCH IRRATIONAL LANGUAGE AND FOR ALLOWING BITTER RESENTFUL THOUGHTS TO ENTER MY HEART
OF ALL THE EXTRAORDINARY DELUSIONS YOU APPEAR TO BE SUFFERING FROM
ELSE A CERTAIN HAIRY GENTLEMAN WHO FIGURES IN ANCIENT HISTORY HAD NEVER LENT HIMSELF TO THAT NEFARIOUS COMPACT WHICH GAVE SO GREAT AN ADVANTAGE TO A YOUNGER BUT SLEEK AND WELL NOURISHED BROTHER IN SPITE OF ALL THIS
THE DROWSY SPIRIT THE FEVER HAD LEFT IN ME OVERCAME MY BRAIN AND I SLEPT ONCE MORE FOR SEVERAL DAYS WHICH BROUGHT ME SO LITTLE STRENGTH THAT I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO LEAVE THE SICK ROOM I HEARD NOTHING FURTHER ABOUT MY PUNISHMENT
THAT I HAD A DECENT FIGURE AND WAS NOT A BAD LOOKING YOUNG FELLOW I WAS PRETTY SURE AND THE HOPE THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CREATE AN IMPRESSION FAVORABLE I MEAN ON THE HEART OF THAT SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL GIRL WAS VERY STRONG IN ME
I'M SURE SIR I APPRECIATE YOUR KINDNESS IN BRINGING ME HERE HE HAD PERHAPS EXPECTED SOMETHING MORE OR SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM ME AS HE CONTINUED STANDING WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON ME THEN WITH A SIGH AND LOOKING ROUND HIM HE SAID IN A DISSATISFIED TONE
GLAD TO FIND THAT WITH EDRA IT WAS ALL PLAIN SAILING IT MUST BE PATENT TO EVERY ONE THAT WOMEN HAVE FAR QUICKER FINER INTELLECTS THAN MEN ALTHOUGH THEIR BRAINS ARE SMALLER BUT THEN QUALITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MERE QUANTITY
LITTLE GRETCHEN HAS HAD TO GO WITHOUT ANYTHING AND SHE HAS BEEN SO GOOD AND PATIENT KATY LOST NO TIME BUT RAN FOR MISSUS BARRETT WHOSE INDIGNATION KNEW NO BOUNDS WHEN SHE HEARD HOW THE HELPLESS PARTY HAD BEEN NEGLECTED
THE GREAT TUB OF FRESH WATER WHICH STOOD BESIDE THE ENGLISH LOOKING WASHSTAND WITH ITS AMPLE BASIN AND EWER THE CHINTZ CURTAINED BED THE COOLNESS THE SILENCE AND SHE CLOSED HER EYES WITH THE PLEASANT THOUGHT IN HER MIND
THE LITTLE GIRL DID NOT SEEM TO BE MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OLD SHE HAD TWO PIG TAILS OF THICK FLAXEN HAIR HANGING OVER HER SHOULDERS AND AT KATY'S APPROACH RAISED A PAIR OF SOLEMN BLUE EYES WHICH HAD SO MUCH APPEAL IN THEM THOUGH SHE SAID NOTHING
BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME HAVE KATY DOCTOR CARR IT WILL SETTLE ALL MY DIFFICULTIES
THE TRAIN FOR PARIS MUST LONG SINCE HAVE STARTED AND KATY FELT DEJECTED AND FORLORN AS MAKING HER WAY OUT OF THE TERRIBLE LADIES' CABIN SHE CREPT ON DECK FOR HER FIRST GLIMPSE OF FRANCE
I HAVE NO ONE BUT A COUPLE OF OLD AUNTS TOO FEEBLE IN HEALTH TO TRAVEL WITH ME OR TO BE COUNTED ON IN CASE OF ANY EMERGENCY YOU SEE I AM A REAL CASE FOR PITY MISSUS ASHE SPOKE GAYLY BUT HER BROWN EYES WERE DIM WITH TEARS AS SHE ENDED HER LITTLE APPEAL
THERE'S A SIGNAL WE'VE ARRANGED WHICH MEANS ALL'S WELL AND WHEN WE GET UP THE RIVER A LITTLE WAY I ALWAYS LOOK TO SEE IF IT'S FLYING IT'S A BIT OF A TOWEL HUNG FROM A PARTICULAR WINDOW AND WHEN I SEE IT I SAY TO MYSELF THANK GOD ANOTHER VOYAGE SAFELY DONE AND NO HARM COME OF IT
WHICH FORTUNATELY WAS CLOSE AT HAND INQUIRY REVEALED THE FACT THAT NO TRAIN FOR PARIS LEFT TILL FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON I AM RATHER GLAD DECLARED POOR MISSUS ASHE FOR I FEEL TOO USED UP TO MOVE
I LOVE MISSUS ASHE FOR INVITING YOU SO DO I SAID KATY SOBERLY IT WAS THE KINDEST THING I CAN'T THINK WHY SHE DID IT
NOT A SAILOR UNDER HIM WOULD HAVE DARED DISPUTE HIS ORDERS FOR A MOMENT BUT HE WAS VERY POPULAR WITH THEM NOTWITHSTANDING THEY LIKED HIM AS MUCH AS THEY FEARED HIM FOR THEY KNEW HIM TO BE THEIR BEST FRIEND IF IT CAME TO SICKNESS OR TROUBLE WITH ANY OF THEM
AND ENJOYED THE JOKE AS MUCH AS ANY ONE AS SHE PRESENTED HERSELF EACH DAY WITH THE INVARIABLE FORMULA A LETTER FOR YOU MA'AM OR A BUNDLE MISS COME BY THE PARCELS DELIVERY ON THE FOURTH MORNING IT WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF BABY ROSE IN A LITTLE FLAT MOROCCO CASE
FILLED HER WITH A SENSE OF DISMAYED SURPRISE GOOD GRACIOUS SHE SAID TO HERSELF EVEN THE BABIES UNDERSTAND IT SHE RACKED HER BRAINS TO RECALL WHAT SHE HAD ONCE KNOWN OF FRENCH
WITH LONG SLENDER WINGS RAISED OVER ITS HEAD AND MEETING TO FORM A POINT ITS PRICE WAS TWENTY FRANCS AND SHE WAS STRONGLY TEMPTED TO BUY IT FOR CLOVER OR ROSE RED
THEN A BOX OF QUININE PILLS THEN A SACHET FOR HER TRUNK THEN ANOTHER BURLESQUE POEM LAST OF ALL A CAKE OF DELICIOUS VIOLET SOAP TO WASH THE SEA SMELL FROM HER HANDS THE LABEL SAID
DON'T WORRY ABOUT US WE SHALL GET ON HAPPILY AND EASILY IN FACT I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF I DEVELOPED SUCH A TURN FOR HOUSEKEEPING THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK THE FAMILY REFUSED TO CHANGE
MISSUS ASHE OFTEN DID COME TO THE OFFICE TO CONSULT DOCTOR CARR AMY MIGHT NOT BE QUITE WELL KATY THOUGHT OR THERE MIGHT BE A LETTER WITH SOMETHING ABOUT WALTER IN IT OR PERHAPS MATTERS HAD GONE WRONG AT THE HOUSE WHERE PAPERERS AND PAINTERS WERE STILL AT WORK
DOWN DOWN DOWN THE GREAT HULL WOULD SLIDE TILL KATY WOULD HOLD HER BREATH WITH FEAR LEST IT MIGHT NEVER RIGHT ITSELF AGAIN THEN SLOWLY SLOWLY THE TURN WOULD BE MADE AND UP UP UP IT WOULD GO TILL THE CANT ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS EQUALLY ALARMING
AND MISSUS ASHE WILL BE EVEN WORSE OFF I KNOW
WHO CARRIED POOR LITTLE PALE AMY IN HIS ARMS AS EASILY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A KITTEN AMY GAVE A SCREAM OF JOY AT THE SIGHT OF KATY AND CUDDLED DOWN IN HER LAP UNDER THE WARM RUG WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF AND SATISFACTION
OH DEAR WHY DO PEOPLE EVER GO TO SEA UNLESS THEY MUST SHE THOUGHT FEEBLY TO HERSELF SHE WANTED TO GET UP AND SEE HOW MISSUS ASHE HAD LIVED THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT THE ATTEMPT TO MOVE MADE HER SO MISERABLY ILL THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SINK AGAIN ON HER PILLOWS
NO OTHER NAME COULD SUIT HER HALF SO WELL AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HER BEING CALLED ANYTHING ELSE WHAT FUN IT WILL BE TO SEE HER AND LITTLE ROSE AND DENISTON BROWNE PUT IN CLOVER SOMEHOW I FIND IT RATHER HARD TO TAKE IN THE FACT THAT THERE IS A DENISTON BROWNE OBSERVED KATY
I HATE BEING AT SEA KATY HEARD HER SAY I WON'T STAY IN THIS NASTY OLD SHIP
NOW DOCTOR CARR PLEASE PLEASE I AM SURE YOU WON'T DENY ME WHEN I HAVE SO SET MY HEART UPON HAVING HER MISSUS ASHE WAS VERY PRETTY AND PERSUASIVE BUT STILL DOCTOR CARR HESITATED
NEARER AND NEARER THEY CAME AND KATY OPENING HER EYES SAW A PROCESSION OF BOOTS AND SHOES OF ALL SIZES AND SHAPES WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN LEFT ON THE FLOORS OR AT THE DOORS OF VARIOUS STATEROOMS AND WHICH IN OBEDIENCE TO THE LURCHINGS OF THE VESSEL HAD COLLECTED IN THE CABIN
THERE WERE MANY WINDOWS WITH BRIGHT POLISHED PANES AND VERY CLEAN SHORT MUSLIN CURTAINS AND ON THE WINDOW SILLS STOOD ROWS OF THRIFTY POTTED PLANTS IN FULL BLOOM MARIGOLDS BALSAMS NASTURTIUMS
THEY WILL THINK THAT I AM MIRACULOUSLY IMPROVED BY ONE NIGHT ON FRENCH SOIL BUT NEVER MIND
SO IT PROVED FOR AFTER THESE TWO BAD DAYS NONE OF THE PARTY WERE SICK AGAIN DURING THE VOYAGE AMY HAD A CLAMOROUS APPETITE FOR STORIES AS WELL AS FOR COLD BEEF AND TO APPEASE THIS CRAVING KATY STARTED A SORT OF OCEAN SERIAL CALLED
KATY GOING DOWN TO HER STATEROOM FOR SOMETHING CAME ACROSS A PALLID EXHAUSTED LOOKING LADY WHO LAY STRETCHED ON ONE OF THE LONG SOFAS IN THE CABIN WITH A BABY IN HER ARMS AND A LITTLE GIRL SITTING AT HER FEET QUITE STILL WITH A PAIR OF SMALL HANDS FOLDED IN HER LAP
TO WHICH IT LED THEM PROVED TO BE QUAINT AND OLD AND VERY PLEASANT OF ASPECT THE LOFTY CHAMBERS WITH THEIR DIMLY FRESCOED CEILINGS AND BEDS CURTAINED WITH FADED PATCH
AND IN A SURPRISINGLY SHORT TIME ALL WAS PRONOUNCED RIGHT THE BAGGAGE HAD PASSED
MOVING TO AND FRO AND ALL THIS CROWD WERE TALKING ALL AT ONCE AND ALL WERE TALKING FRENCH
DOCTOR CARR'S OBJECTIONS HIS RELUCTANCE TO PART WITH HER MELTED BEFORE THE RADIANCE OF HER SATISFACTION HE HAD NO IDEA THAT KATY WOULD CARE SO MUCH ABOUT IT AFTER ALL IT WAS A GREAT CHANCE PERHAPS THE ONLY ONE OF THE SORT THAT SHE WOULD EVER HAVE MISSUS ASHE COULD WELL AFFORD TO GIVE KATY THIS TREAT HE KNEW
AND EUROPE BECKONED MORE BRILLIANTLY NOW THAT THEY WERE FAIRLY EMBARKED ON THEIR JOURNEY
EITHER THEY SHOULD ALL GET TO LAND OR ALL GO TO THE BOTTOM AND BE DROWNED AND AT THAT MOMENT SHE DIDN'T CARE VERY MUCH WHICH IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE GALE INCREASED AS THE DAY WORE ON AND THE VESSEL PITCHED DREADFULLY TWICE KATY WAS THROWN OUT OF HER BERTH ON THE FLOOR
WHICH WENT ON WITHOUT STOP OR STAY THOUGH CUSTOMERS DID NOT SEEM TO BE MANY AND SALES WERE FEW RETURNING TO THE STATION THEY FOUND THAT MISSUS ASHE HAD BEEN ASLEEP DURING THEIR ABSENCE
SHE KNEW OF COURSE THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WERE LIABLE TO BE FOUND SPEAKING THEIR OWN LANGUAGES BUT SOMEHOW THE SPECTACLE OF THE CHATTERING MULTITUDE
LONGWOOD SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH MY DEAREST CHILD YOUR NOTE MADE ME DANCE WITH DELIGHT
AND JUST NOTICE HOW PRETTILY THESE LADIES AT THE NEXT TABLE SPEAK TO THE WAITER
I NOTICED IT LAST NIGHT AND I LIKED IT SO MUCH THAT I MADE A RESOLUTION TO GET UP AND BE AS POLITE AS THE FRENCH THEMSELVES THIS MORNING
JOURNALS ET CETERA IN ONE OF THESE KATY MADE OUT A LIST OF THINGS I MUST SEE THINGS I MUST DO THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO DO ANOTHER SHE DEVOTED TO VARIOUS GOOD SHOPPING ADDRESSES WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HER
PAPA I SHOULD THINK NOT CRIED KATY WITH UNSOPHISTICATED HORROR ONE VERY INTERESTING THING WAS TO HAPPEN BEFORE THEY SAILED THE THOUGHT OF WHICH HELPED BOTH KATY AND CLOVER THROUGH THE LAST HARD DAYS WHEN THE PREPARATIONS WERE NEARLY COMPLETE AND THE FAMILY HAD LEISURE TO FEEL DULL AND OUT OF SPIRITS
I ALSO THINK SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARTILY SORRY A LITTLE LATER HAD SHE DONE SO
A CAKE OF SOAP AND A HAMMER AND TACKS TO NAIL THE WHOLE UP WITH MISSUS HALL'S GIFT WAS A WARM AND VERY PRETTY WOOLLEN WRAPPER OF DARK BLUE FLANNEL WITH A PAIR OF SOFT KNITTED SLIPPERS TO MATCH
BUT KEEPING AN EYE THE WHILE ON ALL THAT WENT FORWARD MISSUS ASHE WALKED PAST THIS PERSONAGE WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE OF HER AS AMERICANS ARE WONT TO DO UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES BUT PRESENTLY THE OBSERVANT KATY NOTICED THAT EVERY ONE ELSE
BUT THERE WERE MISSUS ASHE AND AMY INCLINED TO BE HOMESICK ALSO AND IN NEED OF CHEERING AND KATY AS SHE TRIED TO BRIGHTEN THEM GRADUALLY GREW BRIGHT HERSELF AND RECOVERED HER HOPEFUL SPIRITS BURNET PULLED LESS STRONGLY AS IT GOT FARTHER AWAY
THE NIGHT SEEMED ENDLESS FOR SHE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO SLEEP EXCEPT IN BROKEN SNATCHES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED AND SHE LOOKED THROUGH THE LITTLE ROUND PANE OF GLASS IN THE PORT HOLE ONLY GRAY SKY AND GRAY WELTERING WAVES AND FLYING SPRAY AND RAIN MET HER VIEW
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM DADDY SHE EXCLAIMED TURNING TOWARD HER FATHER IN DESPAIR I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO MARRY HIM IF HE GOES ON MISTER PARKER DECLARED GLOOMILY
MULTI HE GROANED THEN WHAT THE BLAZES WHAT THE I STOPPED SHORT ONCE MORE THE DOOR WAS OPENED THIS TIME WITHOUT THE FORMALITY OF A KNOCK
NOW IF I COULD INSTITUTE A REAL BIG AFFAIR IN THE SHAPE OF A BUCKETSHOP SWINDLE IN WHICH YOUR FATHER AND I COULD PLAY THE PRINCIPAL PARTS AND YOU BECOME MERELY A SUBORDINATE
HE SPENT THREE WEEKS WITH YOU OUT AT YOUR HOME IN OKATA HIS THREATENED ARRIVAL LAST NIGHT WAS THE CAUSE OF YOUR FATHER'S PRECIPITATE RETREAT AND YOURS OH THAT YOUNG MAN
NONE I REPLIED I PUT IT ALL ON TO A WAITER HOW CLEVER OF YOU YOU REALLY DO SEEM TO BE A MOST CAPABLE PERSON AND SO MASTERFUL I BEGIN TO FEAR THAT SOME DAY YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY
AND MISSUS BUNDERCOMBE FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER ONLY ENTERED A FAINT PROTEST AGAINST OUR DEPARTURE IT WAS ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND THE STREETS WERE CROWDED WITH EVERY DESCRIPTION OF VEHICLE THE SUN WAS STILL WARM
I AM QUITE SURE MY SISTER WILL BE AS CHARMED WITH THEM AS I AND MANY OTHER OF MY FRIENDS ARE MISTER SAMUELSON ROSE TO HIS FEET BRUSHED THE CIGARETTE ASH FROM HIS TROUSERS AND TOOK UP HIS HAT
YOU'RE NOT ASSOCIATING THESE PEOPLE WHOEVER THEY MAY BE WITH MISTER AND MISS BUNDERCOMBE I ASKED STERNLY REGGIE GAZED ONCE MORE AT THE POINT OF HIS BOOT THE THING IS HE REMARKED
NOT A SHADOW OF SUSPICION REMAINED IN HIS MIND AS TO MY TWO GUESTS WE SAT A LONG TIME OVER DINNER EVE WAS BETWEEN A COUSIN OF MINE WHO WAS A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT A MASTER OF FOXHOUNDS AND IN HIS WAY QUITE A DISTINGUISHED PERSON
IT'S UNCOMMONLY KIND OF YOU SURE MISTER PARKER SAID THOUGHTFULLY
THEIR HEADS CLOSE TOGETHER AT THE SOUND OF MY FOOTSTEPS AND PRECIPITATE ENTRANCE MISTER PARKER SWUNG ROUND ONE HAND WAS STILL BEHIND HIM UPON THE TABLE A WHITE SILK HANDKERCHIEF WAS LYING MY DEAR FELLOW HE EXCLAIMED
I CAN ASSURE YOU I APPRECIATE IT NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I ALLOW FRIENDS OF YOURS TO BE IRRITATED BY THE INDISCRIMINATE INQUIRIES OF DETECTIVES THE JEWELS CAN GO HANG SIR
I PASSED MY ARM THROUGH HIS AND LED HIM OUT TOWARD THE FOYER YOU SEEM I DECLARED BITTERLY TO HAVE CHOSEN THE MOST UNFORTUNATE PERSONALITY I WISH TO GOODNESS YOU HAD REMAINED MISTER PARKER

THAT IT WAITED FOR THEM AND THAT THIS DETECTIVE FROM SCOTLAND YARD MISTER CULLEN I THINK HIS NAME IS HAS FAIRLY GOT HIS KNIFE INTO THEM AND NOW I REMARKED SMILING YOU ARE PERHAPS COMING TO THE OBJECT OF YOUR VISIT TO ME

HAD I ACTED PROPERLY IN NOT CHARGING THE WAITER
SOMETHING QUITE HARMLESS AND THIS AFTERNOON I HAVE TO GO TO MY DRESSMAKER'S WE'LL COME AT EIGHT O'CLOCK WE'LL COME ON THIS CONDITION MISTER PARKER SUDDENLY DETERMINED MY NAME IS GETTING A LITTLE TOO WELL KNOWN AND IT ISN'T MY OWN ANYWAY
SHE DECLARED RESTING HER HAND ON THE BOSOM OF HER GOWN I AM PERFECTLY CERTAIN IT WAS THERE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AGO MY CAMEO BROOCH YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT OLD SIR HENRY BROUGHT HOME FROM ITALY
ALWAYS I PROMISED HE'S ONE OF THE BEST HE'S SO CLEVER TOO CLEVER WITHOUT A DOUBT I ADMITTED ONLY I THINK PERHAPS WE MIGHT GET HIM TO USE HIS TALENTS IN A MORE ORTHODOX WAY
ANY CLEW AT ALL I ASKED RATHER HARD TO SAY MISTER SAMUELSON REPLIED YOU'LL BE WONDERING WHAT I'VE COME TO SEE YOU ABOUT WELL I'LL JUST EXPLAIN OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT SOME ONE MAY HAVE ENTERED THE HOUSE WHILE WE WERE ALL AT DINNER
WITHOUT HAT OR COAT I JUMPED INTO A TAXI AND IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES I WAS MOUNTING THE STAIRS OF NUMBER SEVENTEEN BANTON STREET WITH THE HALL PORTER BLINKING AT ME FROM HIS OFFICE I SCARCELY WENT THROUGH THE FORMALITY OF KNOCKING AT THE DOOR MISTER PARKER AND EVE WERE BOTH STANDING AT THE TABLE
THERE WAS A FAINT PINK LIGHT IN THE SKY A PERFUME OF LILAC IN THE AIR FROM THE WINDOW BOXES AND FLOWER BARROWS I TOOK EVE'S FINGERS IN MINE AND HELD THEM I THINK SHE KNEW THAT SOMETHING IN THE NATURE OF AN INQUISITION WAS COMING
STEPDAUGHTER THEN TALKING ABOUT MARRYING A MAN SHE'S PROBABLY KNOWN ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND MET AT A BAR OR IN A THIEVES KITCHEN OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT IF YOU MUST MARRY AN ENGLISHMAN SHE CONTINUED WITH RISING VOICE WHY DON'T YOU MARRY LORD REGINALD SIDLEY THERE
MEANTIME I VENTURED WE WILL DINE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AT THE MILAN MISTER PARKER GROANED AT THE MILAN HE ECHOED WORSE AND WORSE WE SHALL BE RECOGNIZED FOR CERTAIN
I WAS TOLD OF A LITTLE RESTAURANT IN SOHO THE OTHER DAY WHERE THE COOKING IS REMARKABLE I'M ALL FOR STEPHANO'S MISTER MOSS DECLARED GRINNING AND THE SOONER THE BETTER
A MAGNIFICENT PERSON WITH POWDERED HAIR BREECHES AND SILK STOCKINGS PRESENTED HIMSELF LORD REGINALD SIDLEY HE ANNOUNCED IN WALKED REGGIE
MY GLOOMIER REFLECTIONS WERE AT ONCE FORGOTTEN IT WAS EVE WHO SPOKE GOOD MORNING MISTER WALMSLEY GOOD MORNING MISS EVE I REPLIED ARE YOU VERY BUSY THIS MORNING SHE ASKED
THEIR ROUTE TO THE SNOW BELT LAY THROUGH SECTIONS OF COUNTRY WHICH HAD BECOME SO SOFT AND OOZY THAT THE HORSES OFTEN SANK IN MIRE FLANK DEEP AND THE STREAMS WERE SO SWOLLEN THAT PROGRESS WAS ALARMINGLY SLOW ON THE SECOND DAY

AS SOON AS THEY REACHED THE COUNTRY AND WERE STILL ON DUTY IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE PROVINCE AND THE NON ENLISTED WERE DEEMED NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE COLONIES OF AMERICAN WOMEN AND CHILDREN ENCAMPED ON THE SOIL OF THE ENEMY MOREOVER
THEY WERE DRIVEN INTO CAMP EARLY BY HEAVY RAINS WHICH DRENCHED CLOTHING BLANKETS AND EVEN THE PROVISIONS CAREFULLY STORED UNDER THE SADDLES AND LEATHER SADDLE COVERS THIS CAUSED A DELAY OF THIRTY SIX HOURS
THE REPORT OF OUR AFFLICTION SPREAD RAPIDLY AND THE WELL MEANING TENDER HEARTED WOMEN AT THE FORT CAME TO CONDOLE AND WEEP WITH US AND MADE THEIR CHILDREN WEEP ALSO BY URGING
WE WOULD FIND IN THE PLAIN WOODEN CRADLE A DAINTY BUNDLE OF SWEETNESS ALL DONE UP IN WHITE
WHILE I CUT THEM OFF AND HOED UP THE ROOTS THE PLANTS TOWERED LUXURIANTLY ABOVE OUR HEADS MAKING THE TASK EXTREMELY PAINFUL
THE GREAT EMPEROR ASKS TO SEE THEE AND THOU MUST COME SHE TOLD HOW POOR RED FACED BEWILDERED MARIE DROPPED HER LADLE AND STARED AT THE SPEAKER
THEN SHE WOULD METE OUT TO US THAT HARDEST OF PUNISHMENTS NAMELY THAT WE WERE NOT TO SPEAK WITH EACH OTHER UNTIL SHE SHOULD FORGIVE OUR OFFENCE FORGIVENESS USUALLY CAME BEFORE TIME TO DRIVE UP THE COWS
HE COULD SECURE IF HE HAD THE READY MONEY TO MAKE ADVANCES AND TO PROCURE THE NECESSARY WARM CLOTHING AND BLANKETS HE HAD CROSSED THE SIERRAS BEFORE

MY EYES WANDERED ABOUT UNTIL THEY BECAME RIVETED ON ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM WHERE STOOD A CHILD'S CRIB WHICH LOOKED LIKE GOLD ITS HEAD AND FOOT BOARDS WERE EMBELLISHED WITH FIGURES OF ANGELS
DRIVING PACK ANIMALS WELL LADEN WITH WARM CLOTHING BLANKETS AND FOOD SUPPLIES LEFT THE FORT AT SUNRISE ON THE MORNING OF FEBRUARY THE FIRST AND ON THE THIRD REACHED JOHNSON'S RANCH
THEY WENT NOT WITH CHEERING WORDS ONLY BUT WITH SOMETHING IN STORE FOR THE EMPTY CUPBOARDS
AND RENDER ALL POSSIBLE AID TOWARD THE IMMEDIATE RESCUE OF THE SNOW BOUND
HE STATED THAT MISSUS MURPHY HAD DIED OF STARVATION SOON AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE THIRD RELIEF AND THAT MY MOTHER HAD WATCHED BY FATHER'S BEDSIDE UNTIL HE DIED
AND COME NOT BACK LATE FOR MILKING THE SEMINARY PLAYGROUND WAS SO NOISY WITH CHATTER AND SCREAMS OF JOY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE GAMES WE PLAYED AND LATER THE DINING ROOM AND ITS OFFERINGS WERE SO SURPRISING AND SO BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED
WE DID NOT KNOW HIS NAME NOR DID WE REALIZE THAT HE WAS SELLING THE MEAT HE HANDED OUT ONLY THAT WE WANTED SOME SO AFTER ALL THE OTHERS HAD GONE WE ADDRESSED HIM ASKING GRANDPA PLEASE GIVE US A LITTLE PIECE OF MEAT
GRANDMA BELIEVING THAT I HAD GONE TO SCHOOL LONG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO FINISH MY STUDIES WITHOUT TEACHERS GEORGIA WAS MORE FORTUNATE WHEN MISS HUTCHINSON OPENED THE YOUNG LADIES SEMINARY IN THE FALL
HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD BE IF YOU HAD DIED IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH YOUR DEAR MOTHER INSTEAD OF BEING LEFT ALONE TO STRUGGLE IN THIS WICKED WORLD THIS WOULD BUT INCREASE MY DISTRESS FOR I DID NOT WANT TO BE DEAD AND BURIED UP THERE UNDER THE COLD DEEP SNOW
RODE TO JOHNSON'S RANCH AND ALL THINGS BEING READY HE APPOINTED RACINE TUCKER CAPTAIN OF THE COMPANY AND IN TOUCHING WORDS COMMENDED THE HEROIC WORK OF ITS MEMBERS AND BADE THEM GODSPEED ON THEIR ERRAND OF MERCY
I WOULD RUSH OFF ALONE AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS TO GET AWAY FROM THE TORTURING SYMPATHY EVEN THERE I MET THOSE WHO WOULD LOOK AT ME WITH GREAT SERIOUS EYES SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND MOURNFULLY SAY YOU POOR LITTLE MITE
GRANDPA BROUGHT THE NEWS HOME CALIFORNIA IS OURS THERE WILL BE NO MORE WAR NO MORE TROUBLE AND NO MORE NEED OF SOLDIERS YET THE WOMEN FELT THAT THEIR BATTLES AND TRIALS HAD JUST BEGUN
I SAW ONLY FINELY DRESSED YOUNG LADIES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE PROMENADING IN THE HALLS AND SMALL GIRLS FLITTING ABOUT IN THE YARD LIKE BRIGHT WINGED BUTTERFLIES SOME HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM HOME AND WERE CALLING OUT THE NEWS OTHERS WERE ENGAGED IN GAMES THAT WERE STRANGE TO ME
BOTH MADE BY POOR MISSUS MC CUTCHEN OF THE DONNER PARTY WHO HAD TO TAKE IN SEWING FOR A LIVELIHOOD BUT TO THE SEMINARY I SHOULD WEAR GRANDPA'S GIFT A COSTLY ALPACA CHANGEABLE IN THE SUNLIGHT TO SOFT MINGLING BLUISH AND GREENISH COLORS OF THE PEACOCK
AND A CANOPY OF LACE LIKE A FLEECY CLOUD HOVERED OVER THEM THE BED WAS WHITE BUT THE PILLOWS WERE COVERED WITH PINK SILK AND ENCASED IN SLIPS OF LINEN LAWN EXQUISITE WITH RARE NEEDLEWORK
AFTER PREPARING HIS BODY FOR BURIAL SHE HAD STARTED OUT ON THE TRAIL TO GO TO HER CHILDREN IN ATTEMPTING TO CROSS THE DISTANCE FROM HER CAMP TO HIS SHE HAD STRAYED AND WANDERED ABOUT FAR INTO THE NIGHT
SHE EXCLAIMED IMPULSIVELY HARK CHILDREN THERE GOES THE CATHOLIC BELL COUNT ITS STROKES CASTLE IS A CATHOLIC AND WAS VERY LOW WHEN I SAW HIM TO DAY TOGETHER WE SLOWLY COUNTED THE KNELLS UNTIL SHE STOPPED US SAYING IT'S FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
I HAVE A FAINT RECOLLECTION OF LISTENING TO THE CHIMES OF THE WEDDING BELLS AND LATER OF HEARING THAT CAPTAIN FRISBIE HAD TAKEN HIS BRIDE AWAY BUT THAT IS ALL FOR ABOUT THAT TIME DEAR OLD JAKIE RETURNED TO US IN ILL HEALTH AND OUR THOUGHTS AND CARE TURNED TO HIM
SHE GAVE THE QUICK CALL WHICH BROUGHT THE FRAU WIRTHIN TO THE SCENE OF CONFUSION WHERE IN MUTE AGONY SHE LOOKED FROM SERVANT TO SERVANT UNTIL WITH HANDS CLASPED AND EYES FULL OF TEARS SHE IMPLORED MARIE
BUT WE WERE NOT MUCH AFRAID WHEN IT WAS LIGHT ENOUGH SO THAT IMAGINATION COULD NOT PICTURE THEM CREEPING STEALTHILY BEHIND US OUR GALLANT COMPANY C OFFICERED BY CAPTAIN BARTLETT AND LIEUTENANTS STONEMAN AND STONE
INTENSE EXCITEMENT AND INDIGNATION PREVAILED AT THE FORT AFTER CAPTAIN FALLON AND OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY GAVE THEIR ACCOUNT OF THE CONDITIONS FOUND AT THE MOUNTAIN CAMPS AND OF INTERVIEWS HAD WITH KESEBERG WHOM THEY NOW CALLED CANNIBAL
GEORGIA CAME UP TO OUR ROOM AND FOUND ME DRESSING MYSELF WITH GREATEST CARE IN AMAZEMENT SHE ASKED ELIZA WHERE ARE YOU GOING AND WAS DUMBFOUNDED WHEN I ANSWERED TO FIND ANOTHER HOME FOR US IN THE LOWER HALL I ENCOUNTERED GRANDMA
THE LAY OF THE DOLOROUS KNIGHT MY HARPER CALLED HIS SONG BUT OF THOSE WHO HEARKENED SOME NAMED IT RATHER THE LAY OF THE FOUR SORROWS IN NANTES OF BRITTANY
AS FOR THE WOUNDED KNIGHT SHE COMMANDED HIM TO BE CARRIED TO HER OWN CHAMBER SHE SENT FOR SURGEONS AND GAVE HIM INTO THEIR HANDS THESE SEARCHED HIS WOUNDS SO SKILFULLY AND TENDED HIM WITH SO GREAT CARE THAT PRESENTLY HIS HURT COMMENCED TO HEAL
MEETLY TO MOURN THE DEAD THERE RODE NIGH UPON TWO THOUSAND KNIGHTS WITH HAUBERKS UNLACED AND UNCOVERED HEADS PLUCKING UPON THEIR BEARDS SO THE FOUR LOVERS WERE PLACED EACH UPON HIS SHIELD AND BEING BROUGHT BACK IN HONOUR TO NANTES
HE KNEW AGAIN HIS TOWN AND HIS MASTER'S HOUSE AND DESCENDED TO THE GROUND AT MILON'S VERY FEET MILON REJOICED GREATLY WHEN HE MARKED HIS OWN HE CAUGHT THE BIRD BY HIS WINGS AND CRYING FOR HIS STEWARD BADE HIM GIVE THE SWAN TO EAT
WITH MANY SHRILL CRIES AND FLUNG THE USELESS FLACKET FAR AWAY
A DAMSEL SWEET OF FACE AND GRACIOUS OF MANNER VERY NEAR TO HER FATHER'S HEART SINCE HE HAD LOST HIS QUEEN THE MAIDEN INCREASED IN YEARS AND FAVOUR BUT HE TOOK NO HEED TO HER TROTHING SO THAT MEN YEA EVEN HIS OWN PEOPLE
THE KNIGHT LOOKED EARNESTLY UPON HIS DAME WELL HE MIGHT SEE THAT SHE WAS FAR AWAY AND CLEARLY HE PERCEIVED THE CAUSE LADY SAID HE YOU ARE IN SORROW OPEN NOW YOUR GRIEF TO ME IF YOU TELL ME WHAT IS IN YOUR HEART
AN OLD AUNT WAS AT THE COSTS OF MY NOURISHING SHE KEPT ME AT HER SIDE TILL OF ALL HER GIFTS SHE GAVE ME HORSE AND ARMS AND SENT ME HERE WHERE I HAVE REMAINED IN HOPE AND WISH I PURPOSE TO CROSS THE SEA AND RETURN TO MY OWN REALM
FROM THE NET WHEREIN THEY WERE TAKEN BUT I FIND MY LIFE MORE BITTER THAN MY COMRADES FOUND THE GRAVE I SEE YOU ON YOUR GOINGS AND COMINGS ABOUT THE HOUSE I MAY SPEAK WITH YOU BOTH MATINS AND VESPERS
EACH CRIED HER NAME WITHIN THE LISTS NOW WHEN EASTERTIDE WAS COME A GREAT TOURNAMENT WAS PROCLAIMED TO BE HELD BEYOND THE WALLS OF NANTES THAT RICH CITY THE FOUR LOVERS WERE THE APPELLANTS IN THIS TOURNEY
GIFTS SHE GAVE TO ALL ALIKE TENDER MESSAGES SHE SENT TO EACH EVERY KNIGHT DEEMED HIMSELF ESTEEMED AND FAVOURED ABOVE HIS FELLOWS AND BY SOFT WORDS AND FAIR SERVICE
SO GREAT WAS HIS PROWESS THAT FROM THE DAY HE WAS DUBBED KNIGHT THERE WAS NO CHAMPION WHO COULD STAND BEFORE HIM IN THE LISTS HE WAS A PASSING FAIR KNIGHT OPEN AND BRAVE COURTEOUS TO HIS FRIENDS AND STERN TO HIS FOES
MEN CAME TO LEARN THE ISSUE OF THIS THING BUT FOR HER PART THE FAIR MAIDEN DID ALL THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO BRING HER LOVE TO A GOOD END
I WILL GO TO HER THE MESSENGER BADE FAREWELL AND RETURNED TO HIS LADY HE PLACED THE RING IN HER HAND SAYING THAT HE HAD DONE HER WILL AS HE WAS BIDDEN TO DO RIGHT JOYOUS WAS THE DAMSEL TO KNOW THAT MILON'S LOVE WAS TENDER AS HER OWN
NOW AGAINST THE FOUR LOVERS ARRAYED THEMSELVES FOUR OTHER KNIGHTS ARMED ALTOGETHER IN COATS OF MAIL AND HELMETS AND GAUNTLETS OF STEEL OF THESE STRANGER KNIGHTS TWO WERE OF HAINAULT AND THE TWO OTHERS WERE FLEMINGS
THOUGH THIS BARON WAS A WORTHY KNIGHT JUSTLY ESTEEMED OF ALL HIS FELLOWS THE DAMSEL WAS GRIEVED BEYOND MEASURE WHEN SHE KNEW HER FATHER'S WILL SHE CALLED TO MIND THE PAST AND REGRETTED THAT MILON HAD GONE FROM THE COUNTRY SINCE HE WOULD HAVE HELPED HER IN HER NEED
IN RETURN HIS SPEAR WAS AIMED WITH SUCH CUNNING THAT HE BORE HIS ANTAGONIST TO THE GROUND MILON LAY UPON THE EARTH BAREHEADED FOR HIS HELMET WAS UNLACED IN THE SHOCK
AND BY THE COUNSEL OF ALL MEN LAID THEM SOFTLY TO REST ON THAT MOUNTAIN WHERE THEY DIED THEN THEY DEPARTED FROM THEM AND LEFT THEM TOGETHER ALONE
CHANGE THY RAIMENT SWIFTLY SAID HE AND HASTEN TO THE CASTLE OF MY FRIEND TAKE WITH THEE MY SWAN AND SEE THAT NONE NEITHER SERVANT NOR HANDMAID DELIVERS THE BIRD TO MY LADY SAVE THYSELF ALONE
BUT AS SOON AS HE MIGHT WENT TO THE DAMSEL'S KINDRED TO OPEN OUT HIS MIND HE DELIVERED TO THE AUNT THE LETTERS HE CARRIED FROM HIS FRIEND AND BEWAILED THEIR EVIL CASE WHEN THE DAME HAD READ THESE LETTERS WITH HIM LINE BY LINE
WHEN THE FOUR LOVERS SAW THEIR ADVERSARIES PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR THE COMBAT THEY HAD LITTLE DESIRE TO FLEE BUT HASTENED TO JOIN THEM IN BATTLE EACH LOWERED HIS SPEAR AND CHOOSING HIS ENEMY MET HIM SO EAGERLY THAT ALL MEN WONDERED
HE SOJOURNED TILL THE WINTER WAS PAST IN THAT LAND HE AND A BRAVE COMPANY OF KNIGHTS WHOM HE HELD IN HIS HOUSE WITH HIM WHEN EASTER HAD COME AND THE SEASON THAT MEN GIVE TO TOURNEYS AND WARS AND THE RIGHTING OF THEIR PRIVATE WRONGS
AND HER HUSBAND TOOK HER TO DWELL WITH HIM IN HIS FIEF WHEN MILON RETURNED TO HIS OWN COUNTRY HE WAS RIGHT HEAVY AND SORROWFUL TO LEARN OF THIS MARRIAGE HE LAMENTED HIS WRETCHED CASE BUT IN THIS HE FOUND COMFORT
WITHOUT PAUSE OR REST BEARING HIS LADY BETWEEN HIS ARMS WHEN THE VARLET HEARD THIS CUNNING COUNSEL OF THE MAIDEN HE REJOICED GREATLY AND THANKING HER SWEETLY FOR HER REDE CRAVED PERMISSION TO DEPART
SHE BROKE THE SEAL AND UNFASTENING THE LETTER CAME UPON THE NAME OF MILON AT THE HEAD SHE KISSED THE NAME A HUNDRED TIMES THROUGH HER TEARS WHEN SHE MIGHT READ THE WRITING SHE LEARNED OF THE GREAT PAIN AND DOLOUR THAT HER LOVER SUFFERED BY DAY AND BY NIGHT
WHO RECEIVED THE GIFT WITH GREAT JOY AND DELIGHT AND RETURNED SWIFTLY TO HIS OWN LAND THE VARLET MADE NO LONG SOJOURN IN HIS HOME HE REPAIRED STRAIGHTWAY TO THE COURT AND SEEKING OUT THE KING REQUIRED OF HIM HIS FAIR DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
MILON APPROVED THE COUNSEL OF THE LADY AND WHEN HER TIME HAD COME SHE WAS BROUGHT TO BED OF A BOY THE OLD NURSE WHO TENDED HER MISTRESS WAS PRIVY TO THE DAMSEL'S INMOST MIND
WHO MIGHT NEVER WIN TOGETHER THERE WAS NO SPEECH BETWEEN THEM SAVE THAT CARRIED BY THE BIRD THEY CAUSED THE SWAN TO FAST FOR THREE DAYS AND THEN SENT HIM ON HIS ERRAND HE TO WHOM THE LETTER CAME SAW TO IT THAT THE MESSENGER WAS FED TO HEART'S DESIRE
WHEN THE KNIGHTS GATHERED TOGETHER FOR THE GAMES EACH OF THESE LORDS CONTENDED EARNESTLY FOR THE PRIZE SO THAT HE MIGHT BE FIRST AND DRAW ON HIM THE FAVOUR OF HIS DAME EACH HELD HER FOR HIS FRIEND EACH BORE UPON HIM HER GIFT PENNON OR SLEEVE OR RING
AND ALL MEN HELD THEM IN SORE DISPLEASURE GREAT WERE THE LAMENTATION AND THE CRY WHEN THE NEWS OF THIS MISCHANCE WAS NOISED ABOUT THE CITY SUCH A TUMULT OF MOURNING WAS NEVER BEFORE HEARD FOR THE WHOLE CITY WAS MOVED
WHETHER IT BE A BOY OR GIRL HIS MOTHER WILL HAVE SUFFERED MUCH BECAUSE OF HIM AND FOR HER SISTER'S SAKE YOU WILL PRAY HER TO CHERISH THE BABE
FOR SHE WOULD NOT SLAY THREE LOVERS WITH HER HAND SO THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE CONTENT
THE SON MADE ANSWER IN FAITH FAIR FATHER LET US RETURN TO OUR OWN LAND THERE I WILL SLAY THIS HUSBAND AND YOU SHALL YET BE MY MOTHER'S LORD
SWEET TO HIS HEART WAS THE WRITING FOR THE LADY WROTE THAT WITHOUT HIM THERE WAS NO JOY IN HER LIFE AND SINCE IT WAS HIS DESIRE TO HEAR BY THE SWAN IT WOULD BE HER PLEASURE ALSO FOR TWENTY YEARS THE SWAN WAS MADE THE MESSENGER OF THESE TWO LOVERS
THE LADY CAUSED THESE THREE DISTRESSFUL KNIGHTS TO BE BURIED WELL AND WORSHIPFULLY IN A RICH ABBEY IN THAT PLACE SHE OFFERED THEIR MASS PENNY AND GAVE RICH OFFERINGS OF SILVER AND OF LIGHTS BESIDES MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON THEM IN THAT DAY
BUT NO OTHER JOY DO I GET NEITHER CLASP NOR KISS NOTHING BUT A FEW EMPTY COURTEOUS WORDS SINCE ALL THESE EVILS ARE COME UPON ME BECAUSE OF YOU I CHOOSE DEATH RATHER THAN LIFE FOR THIS REASON YOUR LAY SHOULD BEAR MY NAME
MILON COMMENCED TO THINK WITHIN HIMSELF HOW BEST HE MIGHT SEND LETTERS TO THE DAMSEL THAT HE WAS COME AGAIN TO HIS HOME YET SO THAT NONE SHOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE THEREOF HE WROTE A LETTER AND SEALED IT WITH HIS SEAL
HE MADE INQUIRY OF THE LAD FRIEND SAID HE HEARKEN TO ME TELL ME NOW THE NAME OF THY SIRE HOW ART THOU CALLED WHO IS THY MOTHER I HAVE SEEN MUCH AND GONE TO AND FRO ABOUT THE WORLD
SHE DEEMED THAT HE HAD SWOONED BY REASON OF HIS PAIN SHE KNEELED HASTILY AT HIS SIDE AND PUT THE ENCHANTED BREWAGE TO HIS LIPS BUT HE COULD NEITHER DRINK NOR SPEAK FOR HE WAS DEAD AS I HAVE TOLD YOU SHE BEWAILED HIS EVIL LOT
HE CAUSED IT TO BE PROCLAIMED BOTH FAR AND NEAR BY SCRIPT AND TRUMPET THAT HE ALONE SHOULD WED THE MAID WHO WOULD BEAR HER IN HIS ARMS TO THE PINNACLE OF THE GREAT AND PERILOUS MOUNTAIN AND THAT WITHOUT REST OR STAY
WHAT HE TOOK FROM THE RICH HE BESTOWED ON SUCH KNIGHTS AS WERE POOR AND LUCKLESS THESE LOVED HIM GREATLY SINCE HE GAINED LARGELY AND SPENT FREELY GRANTING OF HIS WEALTH TO ALL WHEREVER THIS KNIGHT SOJOURNED IN THE REALM HE BORE AWAY THE PRIZE
THE RANKS OF THE TWO COMPANIES WERE CONFUSED TOGETHER SO THAT EVERY MAN FOUGHT AGAINST HIS FELLOW
DEMANDING JUSTICE FOR THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND AND BEGGED THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE A DAY APPOINTED HER FOR REFUTING THE CALUMNIES WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN SOUGHT TO BLACKEN HIS MEMORY THE DAUPHIN PROMISED A SPEEDY REPLY ON THE ELEVENTH OF SEPTEMBER ACCORDINGLY
FOR TO DELIVER THE ASSAULT ALONG WITH HIS
I DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE MANY WHO WILL NOT BE OBEDIENT TO THAT WHICH THE EMPEROR SHALL BE PLEASED TO COMMAND
AND DIGNITY AS SOON CHANGED THEIR POSITION IN ITALY THEY BEGAN BY PROVIDING ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE DEFENCE OF VENICE HERSELF FOREIGNERS BUT ONLY IDLE FOREIGNERS WERE EXPELLED THOSE WHO HAD ANY BUSINESS WHICH SECURED THEM MEANS OF EXISTENCE
AS HIS RIGHTFUL AND OLDEN PATRIMONY AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE CHARGES AND EXPENSES WHICH WOULD BE INCURRED BY THE VENETIAN GOVERNMENT WHILST RENDERING ASSISTANCE TO THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING IN THE AFORESAID WAR THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING BOUND HIMSELF TO APPROVE AND CONSENT THAT THE CITY OF CREMONA
TO PRINCE CHARLES OF AUSTRIA AND OF THE ENORMOUS CONCESSIONS HE HAD MADE BY TWO TREATIES ONE OF APRIL FIFTH FIFTEEN O THREE AND THE OTHER OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY SECOND FIFTEEN O FOUR FOR THE SAKE OF THIS MARRIAGE HE HAD ASSIGNED AS DOWRY TO HIS DAUGHTER FIRST THE DUCHY OF MILAN
WHICH THEY DID NOT SUCCEED IN ENTERING UNTIL THEY HAD LOST ARTILLERY BAGGAGE AND A NUMBER OF PRISONERS THE SPANIARDS SAYS JOHN D'AUTON HALTED BEFORE THE PLACE MADE AS IF THEY WOULD LAY SIEGE TO IT AND SO REMAINED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS THE FRENCH WHO WERE THERE IN GREAT NUMBERS
ON THE FIFTH OF SEPTEMBER A STATE ASSEMBLY WAS HELD AT THE LOUVRE ALL THE ROYAL FAMILY THE PRINCES AND GREAT OFFICERS OF THE CROWN THE PRESIDENTS OF THE PARLIAMENT FIFTEEN ARCHBISHOPS OR BISHOPS THE PROVOST OF PARIS
WHEREFORE MY LORDS SAID THE EMPEROR I PRAY YOU AS MUCH AS EVER I CAN TO BE PLEASED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND SET YOURSELVES AFOOT WITH THEM AND I HOPE WITH GOD'S HELP THAT AT THE FIRST ASSAULT WE SHALL BE MASTERS OF OUR ENEMIES WHEN THE EMPEROR HAD DONE SPEAKING
AND BARRING MY DUTY TO THE KING MY MASTER AND SAVING MY HONOR I WOULD SHOW MY GRATITUDE FOR IT IN WHATSOEVER IT MIGHT PLEASE YOU TO COMMAND ME IN GOOD FAITH SAID LORD LUDOVICO YOU SHALL HAVE PRESENTLY THAT WHICH YOU DO ASK FOR
ARE YOU MOST SERENE OR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND WHEN HE WAS NOTIFIED THAT DISTINGUISHED VENETIANS WERE GOING TO MEET EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN ON HIS ARRIVAL IN ITALY NO MATTER SAID LOUIS LET THEM GO WHITHER THEY WILL
IT NEEDS NOT SO MUCH THOUGHT MY LORD SEND WORD TO THE EMPEROR THAT WE ARE ALL READY I AM EVEN NOW A WEARY OF THE FIELDS FOR THE NIGHTS ARE COLD AND THEN THE GOOD WINES ARE BEGINNING TO FAIL US WHEREAT EVERY ONE BURST OUT A LAUGHING ALL AGREED TO WHAT WAS SAID BY THE LORD OF YMBERCOURT
AND TAKING ONLY SIX MEN WITH HIM HE GALLOPED WITHOUT A HALT EXCEPT TO CHANGE HORSES TO THE FRONTIER OF FLANDERS THE DUKE OF BOURBON COMPLAINED BITTERLY AT THE COUNCIL THAT AN IMMEDIATE ARREST HAD NOT BEEN ORDERED
IN ORDER TO SATISFY HIS GRUDGE ON ACCOUNT OF THE VENETIANS DEMEANOR TOWARDS HIM
LOUIS CONCLUDED ON THE THIRTY FIRST OF MARCH FIFTEEN O FOUR A TRUCE FOR THREE YEARS WITH THE KING OF SPAIN
EITHER FROM PURE FEEBLENESS OR BECAUSE HE WAS STRUCK BY THOSE TRUTHS SO BOLDLY PROCLAIMED YIELDED TO THE COUNSELS OF CERTAIN WISE MEN WHO REPRESENTED TO HIM THAT IT WAS NEITHER A REASONABLE
A MORE SERIOUS AND MORE SKILFUL FOE WHO WAS PREPARING FOR HIM MUCH GREATER EMBARRASSMENTS JULIAN BELLA ROVERA HAD BEFORE HIS ELEVATION TO THE PONTIFICAL THRONE BUT ONE OBJECT WHICH WAS TO MOUNT IT
FOUND HIS BODY STRETCHED ON THE ROAD AND MUTILATED ALL OVER
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT GROUND THAT THE VENETIAN ENVOY GAVE HIS GOVERNMENT THIS ADVICE
BUT OUGHT TO HOLD THE SAID LORD OF BURGUNDY AS WELL AS HIS DEED AGREEABLE TO HIM AND AUTHORIZED BY NECESSITY THE DEFENCE THUS CONCLUDED LETTERS WERE ACTUALLY PUT BEFORE THE KING RUNNING THUS IT IS OUR WILL AND PLEASURE THAT OUR COUSIN OF BURGUNDY
APPEARED BEFORE HIS TROOPS AND HIS PEOPLE LIKE THE VERY SPIRIT OF LETHARGY SAYS A CONTEMPORARY UNPUBLISHED CHRONICLE WITH HIS HEAD BENT DOWN TO THE EARTH AND FOR A LONG WHILE HE REMAINED THUS PENSIVE AND WITHOUT A SINGLE WORD TO SAY
BUT AT THE FOUNTAIN INN YOU WILL TELL ME THAT SO GREAT A KING OUGHT NOT TO PUT UP AT AN INN BUT I SHALL ANSWER YOU THAT IN THIS DISTRICT OF ETAMPES THE BEST HOUSES ARE AS YET THE INNS THERE IS CERTAINLY A ROYAL CASTLE IN THE WHICH LIVES THE QUEEN THE WIFE OF THE DECEASED KING
TO PROVE THAT IT IS LAWFUL AND NOT ONLY LAWFUL BUT HONORABLE AND MERITORIOUS IN ANY SUBJECT TO SLAY OR CAUSE TO BE SLAIN A TRAITOR AND DISLOYAL TYRANT
OF THE NOBLEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THIS GENEROUS ADVICE WAS ACCEPTED BY THE FATHERS AND CARRIED OUT BY THE SONS WITH THAT EARNEST PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE ARDOR WHICH ACCOMPANIES THE RESOLUTION OF GREAT SOULS
AT THE ENTRANCE INTO THE CITY A GREAT NUMBER OF GENTLEMEN FROM THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD WERE PRESENT TO MEET HIM
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE IS A MAN OF SUCH MIGHTY POWER THAT JUSTICE CANNOT WELL BE DONE BY THE SOVEREIGN THIS PRINCIPLE ONCE LAID DOWN JOHN PETIT PROCEEDED TO APPLY IT TO THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY CAUSING TO BE SLAIN THAT CRIMINAL TYRANT THE DUKE OF ORLEANS
AND PLEASED HIM NOT AT ALL HE UTTERED NO WORD BEYOND THAT HE SAID GOOD MY LORDS WE MUST ADVISE THEN HOW WE SHALL DO FOR THE BEST THEN FORTHWITH HE SENT FOR A GENTLEMAN OF HIS WHO FROM TIME TO TIME WENT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AS AMBASSADOR TO THE FRENCH AND SAID TO HIM
HIS HEIRS AND SUCCESSORS BE AND ABIDE AT PEACE WITH US AND OUR SUCCESSORS IN RESPECT OF THE AFORESAID DEED AND ALL THAT HATH FOLLOWED THEREON AND THAT BY US OUR SAID SUCCESSORS OUR PEOPLE AND OFFICERS
TAKING WITH HER ALL HER CHILDREN THE DUKE OF BERRY THE DUKE OF BOURBON THE COUNT OF CLERMONT AND THE CONSTABLE WENT TO MEET HER HERSELF AND ALL HER TRAIN IN DEEP MOURNING SHE DISMOUNTED AT THE HOSTEL OF SAINT PAUL
WHERE HE WAS LODGED AND PLACED IN SECURITY THERE HE PASSED A FORTNIGHT LOUIS REFUSED TO SEE HIM BUT HAD HIM QUESTIONED AS TO SEVERAL MATTERS BY THE LORDS OF HIS GRAND COUNCIL AND GRANTED THAT HE HAD COMMITTED NOUGHT BUT FOLLIES STILL HE SPOKE RIGHT WISELY
AND IT PROVIDED FOR DIVERS POLITICAL INCIDENTS WHICH MIGHT BE ENTAILED AND TO WHICH THE ALLIANCE THUS CONCLUDED SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE ACCORDING TO THE SPECIAL STIPULATIONS WHICH WERE DRAWN UP WITH A VIEW TO THOSE VERY INCIDENTS IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
THE PARISIANS SHOUTED NOEL AS SHE PASSED ALONG AND THE DUKE OF BERRY THE DUKE OF BOURBON THE DUKE OF BRITTANY THE CONSTABLE AND ALL THE GREAT OFFICERS OF THE CROWN RALLIED ROUND HER
THREW HERSELF ON HER KNEES BEFORE THE KING WITH THE PRINCES AND COUNCIL AROUND HIM AND DEMANDED OF HIM JUSTICE FOR HER HUSBAND'S CRUEL DEATH THE CHANCELLOR PROMISED JUSTICE IN THE NAME OF THE KING WHO ADDED WITH HIS OWN LIPS
HE WOULD WILLINGLY ADVISE HIM AS TO HIS AFFAIRS ACCORDING TO HIS ADVICE THE BEST THING WOULD BE TO SURRENDER AND PLACE HIMSELF IN THE HANDS OF THE KING OF FRANCE AND SUBMIT TO HIS GOOD PLEASURE HE WOULD FIND HIM SO WISE AND SO DEBONNAIR AND SO ACCOMMODATING THAT HE WOULD BE BOUND TO BE CONTENT
SHE STARTED FOR PARIS IN THE EARLY PART OF DECEMBER FOURTEEN O SEVEN DURING THE ROUGHEST WINTER IT WAS SAID
I HAVE A GOOD MIND THAT THE KING OF FRANCE'S ARMY AND MINE SHOULD COME TOGETHER IN ORDER THAT BY BATTLE IT MAY BE KNOWN TO WHOM OF RIGHT BELONGS THIS HERITAGE FOR I SEE NO OTHER WAY TO IT BY MY SACRED OATH MY LORD SAID THE GOOD KNIGHT I WOULD THAT IT MIGHT BE TO MORROW PROVIDED THAT I WERE OUT OF CAPTIVITY
BY M ARMAND BASCHET EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
SET ON FOOT AN ACTIVE SEARCH AFTER THE PERPETRATORS HE WAS SUMMONED BEFORE THE COUNCIL OF PRINCES AND THE DUKE OF BERRY ASKED HIM IF HE HAD DISCOVERED ANYTHING I BELIEVE SAID THE PROVOST
NOTHING HOWEVER WITH OUT THE COGNIZANCE OF THE KING WHO HAS A FAR FROM STABLE MIND SAYING YES AND NO I AM OF OPINION THAT THEIR LORDSHIPS SHOULD REMOVE EVERY SUSPICION FROM HIS MAJESTY'S MIND AND AIM AT KEEPING THEMSELVES CLOSELY UNITED WITH HIM
TERRA DI LAVORO AND THE PROVINCE OF THE ABRUZZI
THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY LOOKING TROUBLED AND GROWING PALE COUSIN SAID THE KING OF NAPLES LOUIS D'ANJOU WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE COUNCIL CAN YOU KNOW AUGHT ABOUT IT YOU MUST TELL US
WE AND ALL THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ROYAL HERE PRESENT AFTER HAVING HEARD THE JUSTIFICATION OF OUR UNCLE THE DUKE OF ORLEANS HAVE NO DOUBT LEFT TOUCHING THE HONOR OF HIS MEMORY
TWO MONTHS AFTERWARDS AND NOT BEFORE HE WAS CONDUCTED TO THE KING HIMSELF WHO WAS THEN AT BLOIS LOUIS WELCOMED HIM WITH HIS NATURAL KINDNESS AND SECURED TO HIM FIFTY THOUSAND LIVRES A YEAR ON THE DUCHY OF ANJOU
AND IN SHORT EVERYTHING IN READINESS TO DECAMP NEXT MORNING AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE JUST AS HE LEFT MILAN HE SAID TO THE VENETIAN AMBASSADORS YOU HAVE BROUGHT THE KING OF FRANCE TO DINNER WITH ME
THEY HEARD THAT THE IMPORTANT TOWN OF PADUA WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE SHARE OF EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN WAS UTTERING PASSIONATE MURMURS AGAINST ITS NEW MASTER AND WISHED FOR NOTHING BETTER THAN TO COME BACK BENEATH THE OLD SWAY AND IN SPITE OF THE OPPOSITION SHOWN BY THE DOGE LOREDANO
SUDDENLY DECIDED UPON PUTTING INTO THE HANDS OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS
HAD SCARCELY ANY PROVISIONS AND COULD NOT HOLD OUT FOR LONG HOWEVER THEY PUT A GOOD FACE UPON IT THE CAPTAIN GONZALVO SENT WORD TO THEM THAT IF THEY WOULD SURRENDER THEIR TOWN HE WOULD ON HIS PART RESTORE TO THEM WITHOUT RANSOM ALL PRISONERS AND OTHERS OF THEIR PARTY
THAT HE WOULD PURSUE A PACIFIC AND CONSERVATIVE POLICY AT HOME AND A WARLIKE AND ADVENTUROUS POLICY ABROAD
HE WAS DOWN UPON YOU AND DOWN UPON YOUR FATHER OF COURSE YOUR FATHER HAS MADE A MOST FRAUDULENT ATTEMPT BUT WHAT THE DEVIL IS IT TO HIM THE OTHER YOUNG MAN MADE NO ANSWER BUT ONLY SMILED
AND AS TO HIS HEALTH AH AS TO THAT I CANNOT ANSWER SO DECIDEDLY HE WILL DO NOTHING BECAUSE I TELL HIM DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU COULD PROLONG HIS LIFE
NOR DID SHE LIKE TO SAY THAT THE PLEA GIVEN BY HER MOTHER WAS THE GENERAL STATE OF THE SCARBOROUGH AFFAIRS SHE DID NOT WISH TO DECLARE TO THIS LOVER THAT THAT OTHER LOVER WAS AS NOTHING TO HER AND HOW LONG ARE YOU TO BE AWAY ASKED HARRY
AS THINGS WERE THEN I WAS BOUND TO DO SOMETHING TO SAVE THE PROPERTY
WHO COULD BOAST THAT A REPROBATE FOREIGNER HAD KISSED HIS HAND TO HER FROM THE BOX OF A FASHIONABLE FOUR HORSED COACH FOR IT WAS IN THAT LIGHT THAT MISS GREY REGARDED IT AND DID YOU HAVE ANY FARTHER ADVENTURES BESIDES THIS MEMORABLE ENCOUNTER WITH THE PRINCE
OH HANG IT SAID VIGNOLLES STILL HOLDING THE PACK IN HIS HANDS WHEN THUS APPEALED TO MOUNTJOY RELENTED AND AGREED
ENTERTAINED AN IDEA THAT SHE WAS MORE OF A PERSONAGE IN THE WORLD'S EYES THAN HER COUSIN THAT SHE WENT TO MORE PARTIES WHICH CERTAINLY WAS TRUE IF SHE WENT TO ANY THAT SHE WORE FINER CLOTHES WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE AND THAT SHE HAD A LOVER
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SURGEONS HAVE BEEN AT HIM YOU HAVE YOUR SISTER WITH YOU SIR AND SHE WILL BE OF MORE COMFORT TO YOU THAN I CAN BE YOUR CONDITION IS IN SOME RESPECTS AN ADVANTAGE TO YOU
NOTHING NEARLY SO INTERESTING SAID SOPHY THAT WAS HARDLY TO BE EXPECTED SAID THE ATTORNEY JANE YOU WILL HAVE A GLASS OF PORT WINE GIRLS YOU MUST HAVE A GLASS OF PORT WINE TO SUPPORT YOU AFTER YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE PRINCE
PAPA HAS NOT HAD A NEW PAIR OF TROUSERS THIS YEAR SAID SOPHY EXCEPT THOSE GREEN ONES HE WORE AT THE RACES SAID GEORGINA HOLD YOUR TONGUE MISS SAID HER MOTHER THAT WAS A PAIR I MADE UP FOR HIM AND SENT THEM TO THE MAN TO GET PRESSED
HE DOESN'T HAVE MANY BUT HE MUST HAVE SOME THERE HAD BEEN OTHER APPEALS ON THE SAME SUBJECT MADE NOT VERY LONG SINCE AND TO TELL THE TRUTH MISTER GREY DID REQUIRE TO HAVE THE SUBJECT ARGUED
SOPHY WAS A GOOD DEAL HATED ALSO BEING A FORWARD FLIRTING TRICKY GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHO HAD JUST LEFT THE SCHOOL AT WHICH UNCLE JOHN HAD PAID FOR HER EDUCATION GEORGINA THE THIRD WAS STILL AT SCHOOL UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
THE MAJOR PERTINACIOUSLY REFUSED TO INCREASE HIS STAKES AND WORSE AGAIN REFUSED TO PLAY FOR ANYTHING BUT READY MONEY IT'S A KIND OF THING I NEVER DO YOU MAY THINK ME VERY ODD BUT IT'S A KIND OF THING I NEVER DO
TO THE VOICE OF THE CHARMER ANOTHER CHARMER HAD COME MOST OBJECTIONABLE IN HER SIGHT BUT TO HIM NO WORD OF ABSOLUTE ENCOURAGEMENT HAD AS SHE THOUGHT BEEN YET SPOKEN
BUT HE MUST SAY SOMETHING IN PREPARATION FOR SOME FUTURE FIVE MINUTES AT A TIME TO COME PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE TO MORROW THOUGH HE DID NOT AT PRESENT SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FOR MISSUS MOUNTJOY HE KNEW WOULD SHUT HER DOOR AGAINST HIM
AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE PERSONAL MANNERS OF HER COUSIN WHICH SEEMED TO JUSTIFY HER IN DECLARING HER ABHORRENCE HE WAS A DARK HANDSOME MILITARY LOOKING MAN WHOSE CHIEF SIN IT WAS IN THE EYES OF HIS COUSIN THAT HE SEEMED TO DEMAND FROM HER AFFECTION
SHE NEVER DEMANDED IMMEDIATE HOMAGE BY THE SUDDEN FLASH OF HER BEAUTY BUT WHEN HER SPELL HAD ONCE FALLEN ON A MAN'S SPIRIT IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HE COULD ESCAPE FROM IT QUICKLY WHEN SHE SPOKE A PECULIAR MELODY STRUCK THE HEARER'S EARS
FROM THAT STORY TOLD IN THE WORDS OF A DRUNKEN MAN A MAN DRUNK AND BRUISED AND BLOODY WHO CLEARLY DID NOT UNDERSTAND IN ONE MINUTE THE WORDS SPOKEN IN THE LAST
BUT WITH THIS UNDERSTANDING MOUNTJOY SCARBOROUGH WENT THAT NIGHT TO BED EARLY ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HIS FATHER AGAIN SENT FOR HIM MOUNTJOY HE SAID
AND THAT MADE IT PERFECT IN THE EYES OF HER MALE FRIENDS GENERALLY SHE'S NOT SUCH A WONDERFUL BEAUTY AFTER ALL ONCE SAID OF HER A GENTLEMAN TO WHOM IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT SHE HAD NOT TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO BE PECULIARLY ATTRACTIVE
THOUGHT FLORENCE THERE WAS HER MOTHER STILL LOOKING AT THEM BUT FOR HER HARRY DID NOT NOW CARE ONE STRAW NOR DID HE HATE THOSE BRIGHT ITALIAN LAKES WITH NEARLY SO STRONG A FEELING OF ABHORRENCE FLORENCE YOU ARE NOW ALL MY OWN
THEN MISSUS MOUNTJOY CAME UP AND TOOK FLORENCE AWAY WITH A FEW WORDS OF MOST DISDAINFUL GREETING TO HARRY ANNESLEY WHEN FLORENCE WAS GONE HARRY FELT THAT AS THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE STARS HAD ALL SET
BUT THE ONE AUDITOR WHOM SHE FEARED WAS HER NIECE ON THE PRESENT OCCASION MISS GREY SIMPLY TOOK UP HER BOOK TO SHOW THAT THE SUBJECT WAS ONE WHICH HAD NO INTEREST FOR HER BUT SHE DID UNDOUBTEDLY LISTEN TO ALL THAT WAS SAID ON THE SUBJECT
BETWEEN YOU AND ME I THINK HE MEANS TO INTERFERE WITH ME AND I DO NOT MEAN TO STAND HIS INTERFERENCE I SHOULD THINK NOT HE MUST GO BACK TO BUSTON AMONG THE BUSTONIANS OR HE AND I WILL HAVE A STAND UP FIGHT OF IT
AS HE STATED THE STAKES FOR WHICH HE CONSENTED TO PLAY A REMEMBRANCE THAT IN THE OLD DAYS HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN CALLED CAPTAIN SCARBOROUGH BY THIS MAN WHO NOW LEFT OUT THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE HE HAD FALLEN SINCE THAT
HE HASN'T A SCRUPLE ABOUT THAT IF I LOSE I HAVE TO PAY BY JOVE YES NEVER DIDN'T PAY A SHILLING I LOST IN MY LIFE IT'S DEUCED HARD WHEN A FELLOW IS ON THE SQUARE LIKE THAT TO MAKE TWO ENDS MEET WHEN HE COMES ACROSS DEFAULTERS THOSE FELLOWS SHOULD BE HUNG
BUT IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE FACT THAT MISSUS ARMITAGE WHO GAVE THE DANCE WAS A GREAT FRIEND AND ADMIRER OF HARRY'S AND THAT MISTER ARMITAGE WAS AN ESPECIAL CHUM LET NOT HOWEVER ANY READER SUPPOSE THAT FLORENCE WAS IN THE SECRET
CHAPTER TWELVE HARRY ANNESLEY'S SUCCESS HARRY ANNESLEY A DAY OR TWO AFTER HE HAD LEFT TRETTON
I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO SEE WHAT THAT YOUNG MAN'S ABOUT YOU KNOW HE SAID AFTERWARD TO SEPTIMUS JONES YES YES CERTAINLY SAID SEPTIMUS BUT SEPTIMUS DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS ABOUT
AS SHE THOUGHT SHOULD BE GIVEN BY HER FREELY AFTER HER MARRIAGE
FALLEN VERY LOW HE OUGHT TO FEEL OBLIGED TO ANY MAN WHO HAD IN THE OLD DAYS BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SAME CLUB WITH HIM WHO WOULD NOW GREET HIM WITH THE FAMILIARITY OF HIS UNADORNED NAME BUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE OLD SOUNDS CAME BACK UPON HIS EAR
WHEREAS DOLLY GREY AS SHE CALLED HER COUSIN BEHIND HER BACK HAD NONE THIS LOVER HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HORSES AND HAD ONLY BEEN HEARD OF HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN AT THE MANOR HOUSE
BUT THE BOOKS ARE THE MOST VALUABLE ONLY YOU DO NOT CARE FOR THEM I SHALL NOT HAVE A HOUSE TO PUT THEM IN THERE IS NO SAYING WHAT AN IDIOT WHAT A FOOL WHAT A BLIND UNTHINKING ASS AUGUSTUS HAS BEEN
TILL HE HAD COME TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TROUBLE TO WHICH MOUNTJOY HAD SUBJECTED HIM THAT HE HAD EVER VENTURED TO SPEAK PLAINLY OF HIS OWN PASSION AND EVEN THEN HE HAD NOT ASKED FOR A REPLY SHE WAS STILL FREE AS SHE THOUGHT OF ALL THIS
NOW SCARBOROUGH YOU MAY AS WELL TAKE IT ONCE FOR ALL THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE TALKED DOWN IF YOU WANT TO TALK A FELLOW DOWN YOU CAN GO TO WALKER BROWN OR GREEN THEN WHEN YOU ARE TIRED OF THE OCCUPATION YOU CAN COME BACK TO ME
HE MIGHT AS WELL ESCAPE INTO THE STREET WHERE THERE WAS NO ONE BUT THE POLICE TO WATCH HIM AS HE THREW HIS HAT UP INTO THE AIR IN HIS EXULTATION BUT BEFORE HE DID SO HE HAD TO PASS BY MISSUS ARMITAGE AND THANK HER FOR ALL HER KINDNESS
I SUPPOSE PAPA NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT MISTER CARROLL THIS WAS SAID BY DOLLY AS SOON AS THE FAMILY HAD WITHDRAWN IN WHAT WAY DONE MY DEAR AS TO SETTLING SOME FARTHER SUM FOR HIMSELF HE'D ONLY SPEND IT MY DEAR
MORE THAN ONCE THE WORD HAD BEEN ALL BUT SPOKEN BUT THE WORD HAD NEVER BEEN SPOKEN SHE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED CRUEL PRESSURE IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON HER MOTHER HAD REPRESENTED AS A DUTY THIS MARRIAGE WITH HER COUSIN
WELL YES I SUPPOSE SO A MAN HAS GOT SO MANY THINGS TO LOOK AFTER WHICH HE CAN'T ATTEND TO DOWN HERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BUT YOU UNDERSTAND IT ALL I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO STAY
AND NOW IF I HAVE THIS MONEY IT WILL GIVE ME THE MEANS OF DOING SO YOU OUGHT TO KNOW FOR WHAT PURPOSE I SHALL USE IT THAT IS ALL SETTLED SAID THE FATHER THE DOCUMENT PROPERLY COMPLETED HAS GONE BACK WITH THE CLERK
AND WAS AFRAID THAT HIS PREY WAS ABOUT TO ESCAPE WON'T YOU LIGHT A CIGAR MOUNTJOY TOOK THE CIGAR AND THEN FELT THAT HE COULD NOT GO QUITE AT ONCE I SUPPOSE YOU WENT TO MONACO I WAS THERE FOR A SHORT TIME
IT CERTAINLY IS ESSENTIAL FOR RESPECTABILITY THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE SET APART FROM A MAN'S INCOME FOR HIS WEARING APPAREL AND THOUGH THE MONEY WAS PERHAPS IMPROPERLY SO DESIGNATED
BUT IT CAME TO HER NATURALLY AS THE RESULT OF WHAT HAD GONE BEFORE
NO SAID ANOTHER NO BUT BY GEORGE I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO HAVE THE ALTERING OF HER IT WAS THUS THAT MEN GENERALLY FELT IN REGARD TO FLORENCE MOUNTJOY WHEN THEY CAME TO RECKON HER UP THEY DID NOT SEE HOW ANY CHANGE WAS TO BE MADE
HE WAS AWARE THAT THERE WAS SOME SECRET UNKNOWN TO HIM AND WAS ANXIOUS TO BE INFORMED WAS HARRY AWARE OF MOUNTJOY'S HIDING PLACE AND IF SO HOW HAD HE LEARNED IT WHY WAS IT THAT HARRY SHOULD BE ACQUAINTED WITH THAT WHICH WAS DARK TO ALL THE WORLD BESIDES
SIMPLY AS A PIECE OF PREY WHOM CHANCE HAD THROWN UP ON THE SHORE AND MOODY WHO WOULD NO DOUBT SHOW HIMSELF BEFORE LONG WAS ANOTHER BIRD OF THE SAME COVEY THOUGH LESS RAPACIOUS MOUNTJOY PUT HIS HAND UP
THAT I AM EVEN WITH HIM BEFORE ALL IS OVER I SHALL TRY IT ON WITH HIM SIR
WELCHER IS A THING YOU NEEDN'T HAVE TO DO WITH IF YOU'RE CAREFUL BUT WHEN A FELLOW TURNS ROUND UPON YOU AS A DEFAULTER AT CARDS THERE IS NO GETTING RID OF HIM
ON THE NEXT MORNING SEPTIMUS JONES TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND ON THE DAY FOLLOWING AUGUSTUS FOLLOWED HIM
AS THE COMPARISONS ALREADY INSTITUTED CLEARLY INDICATE IT IS THUS POSSIBLE THESE SCHOLARS BELIEVE
THE TENDENCY TO IDEALIZE NATIONAL HEROES
SO THAT ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL ASK FOR THEMSELVES A BLESSING LIKE THINE OWN SO ABRAHAM WENT FORTH
POINT SOME WRITERS THINK TO TWO ORIGINALLY DISTINCT ACCOUNTS OF THE FLOOD WHICH HAVE BEEN CLOSELY WOVEN TOGETHER BY THE FINAL EDITOR OF THE BOOK OF GENESIS WHEN THESE TWO ACCOUNTS ARE DISENTANGLED THEY ARE EACH PRACTICALLY COMPLETE
IN THE LIGHT OF THESE PROFOUND RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS MAY ANY ONE REASONABLY QUESTION THE RIGHT OF THESE STORIES TO A PLACE IN THE BIBLE
THE GROUP OF STORIES MOST FULLY QUOTED AND THEREFORE BEST PRESERVED IS THE EARLY JUDEAN PROPHETIC NARRATIVES WHEN THESE ARE SEPARATED FROM THE LATER PARALLELS THEY GIVE A MARVELOUSLY COMPLETE AND CONSISTENT PORTRAIT OF ABRAHAM TWO
BUT ALSO THAT TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL OF DANGER AND PRIVATION WHICH WAS ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR HIGHEST DEVELOPMENT
AND STEALING STILL CONTINUES STEALING LOWELL IF CHOSEN MEN COULD NEVER BE ALONE IN DEEP MID SILENCE OPEN DOORED WITH GOD NO GREATNESS EVER HAD BEEN DREAMED OR DONE
WHAT DOES THE STATEMENT ABOUT ABRAHAM'S WEALTH IN CATTLE AND SILVER AND GOLD SHOW REGARDING THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH HE CAME AND THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF GOD'S DIRECTION FOR HIS REMOVAL IMMIGRANTS AND PIONEERS ARE USUALLY THE SELF RELIANT
AND TO THRIVE WHERE THE CITIZEN OF A MORE PROSPEROUS LAND WOULD INEVITABLY STARVE IT IS PROBABLE THAT IN THEIR EARLY NOMADIC EXPERIENCES THE HEBREWS ACQUIRED THOSE MIGRATORY HABITS
MIGRATED FROM THE LAND OF ARAM TO SEEK FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR DESCENDANTS A PERMANENT HOME IN THE LAND OF CANAAN ABRAHAM WHOSE NAME IN HEBREW MEANS EXALTED FATHER OR AS IT WAS LATER INTERPRETED FATHER OF A MULTITUDE
THE LEADING SCIENTISTS HAVE LAID GREAT STRESS UPON THE DOCTRINE OF THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST AS THE TRUE EXPLANATION OF PROGRESS IN THE NATURAL WORLD IT WAS APPARENTLY MADE CLEAR BY DARWIN AND SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
THE EXPLANATION IS AS SIMPLE AND AS TRUE TO HUMAN EXPERIENCE TO DAY AS IN THE CHILDHOOD OF THE RACE THE PERSIAN RELIGION ON THE CONTRARY CONCEIVED OF THE WORLD AS CONTROLLED BY TWO HOSTILE GODS
THREE PRINCIPLES ILLUSTRATED BY JOSEPH'S LIFE ARE TRUE TO ALL TIME ONE THE ONLY SUCCESSFUL WAY TO FORGET ONE'S OWN BURDENS IS TO HELP BEAR ANOTHER'S TWO
AT CERTAIN PERIODS ALSO THE MEAGRE FARE OF THE DESERT DWELLER IS SUPPLEMENTED BY THE QUAILS WHICH HE IS ABLE TO CAPTURE AND THESE ARE A WELCOME RELIEF TO HIS MONOTONOUS DIET ABOUT THE PERENNIAL SPRINGS
THIS GREAT CONQUEROR LIVED CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH MANASSEH DURING WHOSE REIGN ASSYRIAN INFLUENCE WAS PARAMOUNT IN THE KINGDOM OF JUDAH IN HIS QUEST FOR HEALING AND IMMORTALITY
WHICH LAY ON THE NORTHERN HORIZON AS VIEWED FROM THE TIGRIS EUPHRATES VALLEY HERE THE SHIP GROUNDED THEN WHEN THE SEVENTH DAY ARRIVED I SENT FORTH A DOVE AND LET IT LOOSE
THIS CUSTOM WAS FIRST INSTITUTED BY MOSES WHEN THE FLOOD SUBSIDES HOWEVER A COVENANT IS CONCLUDED AND IS SEALED BY THE RAINBOW IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHICH MAN'S COMMISSION TO RULE OVER ALL OTHER LIVING THINGS IS RENEWED
MORALITY AND RELIGION WERE RARELY COMBINED THE HEBREW PEOPLE WERE THE FIRST TO DEFINE RIGHT AND WRONG IN TERMS OF PERSONAL LIFE AND SERVICE SIN AS REPRESENTED IN GENESIS THREE WAS THE RESULT OF INDIVIDUAL CHOICE
MANY AND VARIOUS HAVE BEEN THE DEFINITIONS OF SIN AND THE EXPLANATIONS OF ITS ORIGIN MOST PRIMITIVE PEOPLES DEFINED IT AS FAILURE TO PERFORM CERTAIN CEREMONIAL ACTS OR TO BRING TRIBUTE TO THE GODS
AND HE THUS GIVES TO HIS RULES OF ACTION THE SANCTION OF DIVINITY AND AS SOCIETY DEVELOPS THROUGH THE PASTORAL AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL STAGES INTO THE TRIBE AND STATE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF RELIGION AND THE GROWING SENSE OF RIGHT
THE HISTORY OF THE FLOOD TRADITION CURRENT AMONG THE PEOPLES OF SOUTHWESTERN ASIA A FRAGMENT OF THE BABYLONIAN FLOOD STORY COMING FROM AT LEAST AS EARLY AS TWO THOUSAND B C HAS RECENTLY BEEN DISCOVERED THE PROBABILITY IS
BUT IT CAME BACK BECAUSE IT FOUND NO RESTING PLACE IT RETURNED THEN I SENT FORTH A RAVEN AND LET IT LOOSE THE RAVEN WENT FORTH AND SAW THAT THE WATERS HAD DECREASED IT FED IT WADED IT CROAKED
FROM THESE THEY MAKE A COARSE FLOUR AND BREAD WHICH KEEPS THEM ALIVE UNTIL THE WINTER RAINS AGAIN BRING THEIR SUPPLY OF WATER AND PASTURAGE SOME SCHOLARS HOLD THAT THIS COARSE FOOD WAS THE MANNA OF THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNTS
APPARENTLY SYMBOLIZES TEMPTATION IS TEMPTATION NECESSARY FOR MAN'S MORAL DEVELOPMENT THE SERPENT WAS EVIDENTLY CHOSEN BECAUSE OF ITS REPUTATION FOR CRAFT AND TREACHERY THE SERPENT'S WORDS REPRESENT THE NATURAL INCLINATIONS
DARWIN ORIGIN OF SPECIES WALLACE DARWINISM THREE WILLIAM DAWSON MODERN IDEAS OF EVOLUTION ARTICLE EVOLUTION IN LEADING ENCYCLOPEDIAS
WITHOUT MENTIONING THE SUBJECT OF COMPENSATION HAVING SECURED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE HIS ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO WORK RECOGNITION WOULD COME IN DUE TIME THIS ADVICE RECEIVED THE APPROVAL OF MANY PROMINENT BUSINESS MEN
THE DREAMS WHICH JOSEPH TOLD TO HIS BROTHERS REVEAL HIS HIGH ESTIMATE OF HIS OWN IMPORTANCE AND WERE PROBABLY SUGGESTED BY HIS FATHER'S ATTITUDE TOWARD HIM THEY WERE INDEED A REVELATION OF THE AMBITIONS ALREADY STIRRING IN THE YOUNG BOY'S MIND
GORDON EARLY TRADITIONS OF GENESIS
IT CONCRETELY ILLUSTRATES THE FACT THAT THE FIRST ESSENTIAL OF SUCCESS IS THE WILLINGNESS TO SERVE IT ALSO EMPHASIZES THE NECESSITY OF BEING READY TO DO THE WORK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EMPLOYER'S WISHES
BY PUBLIC STONING HOW FAR HAS THIS CHARACTERISTIC SURVIVED TO THE GLORY OF THE JEWISH RACE THE TRIBAL ORGANIZATION ALSO CHERISHED THE FREEDOM OF EACH INDIVIDUAL
SO THAT HE BECAME A PROSPEROUS MAN AND WAS IN THE HOUSE OF HIS MASTER THE EGYPTIAN WHEN HIS MASTER SAW THAT JEHOVAH WAS WITH HIM AND THAT JEHOVAH CAUSED EVERYTHING THAT HE DID TO PROSPER IN HIS HANDS
IS NOT MERELY AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS BRINGS ITS JUST REWARD BUT OF THE PROFOUNDER PRINCIPLE THAT IT IS THE MORALLY FIT WHO SURVIVE IN BOTH OF THE VERSIONS NOAH IN A VERY TRUE SENSE
THE HEBREWS HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND HAVE FOUND IN HIM THEIR DEFENDER AND PERSONAL FRIEND AS HAS NO OTHER PEOPLE IN HUMAN HISTORY
WERE PROMPTLY DECAPITATED WITHOUT TRIAL WAS SUCH AN ACT RIGHT WAS IT NECESSARY WHAT CONDITIONS WOULD JUSTIFY SUCH AN ACT IN THE UNITED STATES
THAT THE TRADITION GOES BACK TO THE EARLIEST BEGINNINGS OF BABYLONIAN HISTORY THE SETTING OF THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE FLOOD IS ALSO THE TIGRIS EUPHRATES VALLEY RATHER THAN PALESTINE
AND WORK IN KEEPING WITH THEIR DISTINCTIVE IDEALS EACH INDIVIDUAL NARRATIVE HAS AN INDEPENDENT UNITY AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS IS FAR
WITH THEIR SHEEN THEY LIGHTED UP THE WORLD ADAD'S TEMPEST REACHED TO HEAVEN AND ALL LIGHT WAS CHANGED TO DARKNESS SO GREAT WAS THE HAVOC WROUGHT BY THE STORM THAT THE GODS BOWED DOWN SAT THERE WEEPING
AS IN THE CASE OF THE GOSPELS THEY HAVE BEEN COMBINED WITH GREAT SKILL SOMETIMES AS IN THE CASE OF THE EXPULSION OF HAGAR THE TWO VERSIONS ARE INTRODUCED AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE LIFE OF THE PATRIARCH MORE COMMONLY THE TWO OR MORE VERSIONS ARE CLOSELY INTERWOVEN
OR THAT RENDER THE OLD ONES MORE EFFICIENT EMIGRATION AND PIONEERING ARE THUS A NORMAL OUTGROWTH OF A PROGRESSIVE GROWING PEOPLE IN ANY STAGE OF CIVILIZATION
CATTLE OF THE FIELD BEASTS OF THE FIELD THE CRAFTSMEN ALL OF THEM I BROUGHT ON BOARD IN THE EVENING AT THE COMMAND OF THE GOD SHAMASH THE RAINS BEGAN TO DESCEND
WE MAY STUDY CUSTOM IN THE MAKING AS WHEN IN A NEW SITUATION A RULER RENDERS A DECISION WHICH HENCEFORTH BECOMES A LAW THUS DAVID DIVIDING THE SPOIL AFTER HIS VICTORY OVER THE AMALEKITES
ASSOCIATED WITH A BEING FELT TO BE DIVINE IS NOT UNIVERSAL INASMUCH AS MANY MEMBERS OF SOCIETY ARE FOUND READY TO ACT SELFISHLY TAKING THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS
EVEN IN MORE FERTILE LANDS THE GREEKS REARED BESIDE SUCH SPRINGS TEMPLES TO THE GOD WHOM THEY THOUGHT OF AS THUS SIGNALLY REVEALING HIMSELF IN THE DEEPER SENSE EACH OF THESE EARLY HEBREW STORIES IS HISTORICAL
WAS BY NO MEANS JUSTIFIABLE NEVERTHELESS IT BROUGHT TO JOSEPH THE EXPERIENCES AND OPPORTUNITIES ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS ULTIMATE SUCCESS
THOUGH NOT LESS PLENTIFUL AND SAVOURY AND THE BILL OF FARE IN ONE HOUSE WOULD NOT BE SO LIKE THAT IN ANOTHER AS IT IS NOW FOR FAMILY RECEIPTS WERE HELD IN HIGH ESTIMATION
WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE FEW SPECIMENS STILL REMAINING OF COACH BUILDING IN THE LAST CENTURY IT STRIKES ONE THAT THE CHIEF OBJECT OF THE BUILDERS MUST HAVE BEEN TO COMBINE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE WEIGHT WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF ACCOMMODATION
AND HAVE NO DOUBT OF REDRESS FROM THAT PIOUS LEARNED
WHO WERE JUST THEN ENGAGED WITH MISSUS LEIGH PERROT IN ARRANGING HER LATE HUSBAND'S AFFAIRS BUT AUNT JANE BECAME TOO ILL TO HAVE ME IN THE HOUSE AND SO I WENT INSTEAD TO MY SISTER MISSUS LEFROY AT WYARDS THE NEXT DAY WE WALKED OVER TO CHAWTON
AND CAN SO PERFECTLY WALK TO ALTON OR BACK AGAIN WITHOUT FATIGUE THAT I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO DO BOTH WHEN SUMMER COMES ALAS SUMMER CAME TO HER ONLY ON HER DEATHBED MARCH
BUT I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD FROM THE FIRST VERY LITTLE EXPECTATION OF A PERMANENT CURE ALL THAT WAS GAINED BY THE REMOVAL FROM HOME WAS THE SATISFACTION OF HAVING DONE THE BEST THAT COULD BE DONE TOGETHER WITH SUCH ALLEVIATIONS OF SUFFERING
THOUGH WE HEAR THAT HE ACQUITS HIMSELF WITH AS MUCH EASE AND COLLECTEDNESS AS IF HE HAD BEEN USED TO IT ALL HIS LIFE WE HAVE NO CHANCE WE KNOW OF SEEING YOU BETWEEN STREATHAM AND WINCHESTER YOU GO THE OTHER ROAD AND ARE ENGAGED TO TWO OR THREE HOUSES
I GIVE YOU JOY OF HAVING LEFT WINCHESTER NOW YOU MAY OWN HOW MISERABLE YOU WERE THERE NOW IT WILL GRADUALLY ALL COME OUT YOUR CRIMES AND YOUR MISERIES HOW OFTEN YOU WENT UP BY THE MAIL TO LONDON AND THREW AWAY FIFTY GUINEAS AT A TAVERN
FOR THEY HUNTED AT AN EARLY AGE IN A SCRAMBLING SORT OF WAY UPON ANY PONY OR DONKEY THAT THEY COULD PROCURE OR IN DEFAULT OF SUCH LUXURIES ON FOOT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SIR FRANCIS AUSTEN WHEN SEVEN YEARS OLD
ABOUT NINE THIS MORNING LATER THAN IT USED TO BE UNCLE HENRY AND I HAD A GLIMPSE OF HIS HANDSOME FACE LOOKING ALL HEALTH AND GOOD HUMOUR I WONDER WHEN YOU WILL COME AND SEE US I KNOW WHAT I RATHER SPECULATE UPON
I WISH IT MAY PROVE SO NOW AND THAT WHEN MISTER W DIGWEED REACHES STEVENTON TO MORROW
I WILL NOT BOAST OF MY HANDWRITING NEITHER THAT NOR MY FACE HAVE YET RECOVERED THEIR PROPER BEAUTY BUT IN OTHER RESPECTS I GAIN STRENGTH VERY FAST I AM NOW OUT OF BED FROM NINE IN THE MORNING TO TEN AT NIGHT
SHE AND HER SECOND HUSBAND WENT TO FRANCE IN THE HOPE OF RECOVERING SOME OF THE COUNT'S PROPERTY AND THERE NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING INCLUDED AMONGST THE DETENUS ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN BY BUONAPARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN ALL ENGLISH TRAVELLERS
SWEET VIOLETS BOTH PURPLE AND WHITE GROW IN ABUNDANCE BENEATH ITS SOUTH WALL ONE MAY IMAGINE FOR HOW MANY CENTURIES THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE LITTLE FLOWERS HAVE OCCUPIED THAT UNDISTURBED SUNNY NOOK
WITH REGARD TO THE MISTRESSES IT IS I BELIEVE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THE TIME TO WHICH I REFER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THEY TOOK A PERSONAL PART IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF COOKERY AS WELL AS IN THE CONCOCTION OF HOME MADE WINES
NO CORNICE MARKED THE JUNCTION OF WALL AND CEILING WHILE THE BEAMS WHICH SUPPORTED THE UPPER FLOORS PROJECTED INTO THE ROOMS BELOW IN ALL THEIR NAKED SIMPLICITY COVERED ONLY BY A COAT OF PAINT OR WHITEWASH
NOR REJECTS BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT COME WITHIN THE RULE OF COMPOSITION PURE AND PICTURESQUE UNNUMBERED SIMPLE SCENES WHICH FILL THE LEAVES OF NATURE'S SKETCH BOOK OF THIS SOMEWHAT TAME COUNTRY STEVENTON FROM THE FALL OF THE GROUND AND THE ABUNDANCE OF ITS TIMBER
BUT WHICH THE HISTORIAN HAS THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN RECOVERING AT THAT TIME THE DINNER TABLE PRESENTED A FAR LESS SPLENDID APPEARANCE THAN IT DOES NOW IT WAS APPROPRIATED TO SOLID FOOD RATHER THAN TO FLOWERS FRUITS AND DECORATIONS
THE FUTURE ADMIRAL OF THE BRITISH FLEET MUST HAVE CUT A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE IN THE HUNTING FIELD THE OTHER PECULIARITY WAS THAT WHEN THE ROADS WERE DIRTY THE SISTERS TOOK LONG WALKS IN PATTENS THIS DEFENCE AGAINST WET AND DIRT IS NOW SELDOM SEEN
AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR OWN PARENTS THE TWO YOUNG COOPERS PAID LONG VISITS AT STEVENTON EDWARD COOPER DID NOT LIVE UNDISTINGUISHED
TO THE MUSIC OF A HARPSICHORD IN THE HOUSE OR A FIDDLE FROM THE VILLAGE THIS WAS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE
AND MADE OF IMPORTANCE MANY THINGS CONNECTED WITH THE BALL ROOMS OF THOSE DAYS HAVE NOW PASSED INTO OBLIVION THE BARBAROUS LAW WHICH CONFINED THE LADY TO ONE PARTNER THROUGHOUT THE EVENING MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED BEFORE JANE WENT TO BALLS
IT WAS THOUGHT MERITORIOUS ON THE EVENING OF A HUNTING DAY TO TURN OUT AFTER DINNER LANTHORN IN HAND AND VISIT THE STABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE HORSE HAD BEEN WELL CARED FOR THIS WAS OF THE MORE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE PREVIOUS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF CLIPPING ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY
AND IT MAY BE REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT SOME OF THE INCIDENTS AND FEELINGS WHICH ARE SO VIVIDLY PAINTED IN THE MANSFIELD PARK THEATRICALS ARE DUE TO HER RECOLLECTIONS OF THESE ENTERTAINMENTS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY LEFT STEVENTON ONE GREAT AFFLICTION CAME UPON THE FAMILY
THE SENSE OF POWER REVIVED AND IMAGINATION RESUMED ITS COURSE SHE CANCELLED THE CONDEMNED CHAPTER AND WROTE TWO OTHERS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT IN ITS STEAD
THE FAMILY WAS UNBROKEN BY DEATH AND SELDOM VISITED BY SORROW THEIR SITUATION HAD SOME PECULIAR ADVANTAGES BEYOND THOSE OF ORDINARY RECTORIES STEVENTON WAS A FAMILY LIVING MISTER KNIGHT THE PATRON WAS ALSO PROPRIETOR OF NEARLY THE WHOLE PARISH
WE MAY REJOICE THAT THESE CAUSES OF IRRITATION NO LONGER EXIST AND THAT IF SUCH FEELINGS AS JEALOUSY RIVALRY AND DISCONTENT EVER TOUCH CELESTIAL BOSOMS IN THE MODERN BALL ROOM THEY MUST ARISE FROM DIFFERENT AND MORE RECONDITE SOURCES
BUT THEY WERE PRACTISED BY MANY WHO WERE UNEQUIVOCALLY GENTLEMEN AND WHOSE GRANDSONS OCCUPYING THE SAME POSITION IN LIFE MAY PERHAPS BE ASTONISHED AT BEING TOLD THAT SUCH THINGS WERE
ALONG THE UPPER OR SOUTHERN SIDE OF THIS GARDEN RAN A TERRACE OF THE FINEST TURF
AND DISTILLING OF HERBS FOR DOMESTIC MEDICINES WHICH ARE NEARLY ALLIED TO THE SAME ART LADIES DID NOT DISDAIN TO SPIN THE THREAD OF WHICH THE HOUSEHOLD LINEN WAS WOVEN SOME LADIES LIKED TO WASH WITH THEIR OWN HANDS THEIR CHOICE CHINA AFTER BREAKFAST OR TEA
COMPARED WITH THE BROAD RIVER THE RICH VALLEY AND THE NOBLE HILLS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BEHOLD AT HER NATIVE HOME NEAR HENLEY UPON THAMES THE HOUSE ITSELF STOOD IN A SHALLOW VALLEY SURROUNDED BY SLOPING MEADOWS WELL SPRINKLED WITH ELM TREES AT THE END OF A SMALL VILLAGE OF COTTAGES
AND CASSANDRA FELT NO DOUBT AS TO HIS MOTIVES BUT THEY NEVER AGAIN MET WITHIN A SHORT TIME THEY HEARD OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH I BELIEVE THAT IF JANE EVER LOVED IT WAS THIS UNNAMED GENTLEMAN BUT THE ACQUAINTANCE HAD BEEN SHORT
TO MAKE ENQUIRIES AFTER OUR AUNT SHE WAS THEN KEEPING HER ROOM BUT SAID SHE WOULD SEE US AND WE WENT UP TO HER SHE WAS IN HER DRESSING GOWN AND WAS SITTING QUITE LIKE AN INVALID IN AN ARM CHAIR BUT SHE GOT UP AND KINDLY GREETED US AND THEN
AND WAS FORMED INTO A RUSTIC SHRUBBERY WITH OCCASIONAL SEATS ENTITLED THE WOOD WALK THE OTHER RAN STRAIGHT UP THE HILL UNDER THE NAME OF THE CHURCH WALK BECAUSE IT LED TO THE PARISH CHURCH
AS POPE SAYS NOR DOES LIFE'S STREAM FOR OBSERVATION STAY IT HURRIES ALL TOO FAST TO MARK THEIR WAY IMPORTANT INVENTIONS SUCH AS THE APPLICATIONS OF STEAM GAS AND ELECTRICITY MAY FIND THEIR PLACES IN HISTORY
MUCH WORSE THAN ANY ONE CAN BEAR AND I BEGIN TO THINK IT WILL NEVER BE FINE AGAIN THIS IS A FINESSE OF MINE FOR I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT IF ONE WRITES ABOUT THE WEATHER IT IS GENERALLY COMPLETELY CHANGED BEFORE THE LETTER IS READ
NO DON'T TELL HIM WHAT YOU WILL BUT TELL HIM THAT GRANDMAMMA BEGS HIM TO MAKE JOSEPH HALL PAY HIS RENT IF HE CAN YOU MUST NOT BE TIRED OF READING THE WORD UNCLE FOR I HAVE NOT DONE WITH IT
AND NOW AND THEN THE UNWELCOME ADDER TWO SUCH HEDGEROWS RADIATED AS IT WERE FROM THE PARSONAGE GARDEN ONE A CONTINUATION OF THE TURF TERRACE PROCEEDED WESTWARD FORMING THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE HOME MEADOWS
IN HER YOUTH SHE HAD DECLINED THE ADDRESSES OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GOOD CHARACTER AND CONNECTIONS AND POSITION IN LIFE OF EVERYTHING IN FACT EXCEPT THE SUBTLE POWER OF TOUCHING HER HEART
IT MUST BE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THIS CUSTOM WAS IN ONE RESPECT ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GENTLEMAN INASMUCH AS IT RENDERED HIS DUTIES MORE PRACTICABLE HE WAS BOUND TO CALL UPON HIS PARTNER THE NEXT MORNING
BUT AT THE POST HOUSES MISSUS HENRY AUSTEN GAVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS HERSELF AND HER FRENCH WAS SO PERFECT THAT SHE PASSED EVERYWHERE FOR A NATIVE
BUT THOSE TRIFLING WORDS WERE THE LAST OF HERS THAT I CAN REMEMBER FOR I RETAIN NO RECOLLECTION OF WHAT WAS SAID BY ANYONE IN THE CONVERSATION THAT ENSUED I WAS STRUCK BY THE ALTERATION IN HERSELF SHE WAS VERY PALE
STEVENTON IS A SMALL RURAL VILLAGE UPON THE CHALK HILLS OF NORTH HANTS SITUATED IN A WINDING VALLEY ABOUT SEVEN MILES FROM BASINGSTOKE THE SOUTH WESTERN RAILWAY CROSSES IT BY A SHORT EMBANKMENT
A YOUNG MAN WHO EXPECTED TO HAVE HIS THINGS PACKED OR UNPACKED FOR HIM BY A SERVANT WHEN HE TRAVELLED
WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD THEIR COAT FROM A LONDON TAILOR WOULD ALWAYS BRUSH THEIR EVENING SUIT THEMSELVES RATHER THAN ENTRUST IT TO THE CARELESSNESS OF A ROUGH SERVANT AND TO THE RISKS OF DIRT AND GREASE IN THE KITCHEN
EVEN IF ONLY WAITING BUT WAITING IS SUCH UNHEROIC BUSINESS THAT IS THE PART THAT USUALLY FALLS TO A WOMAN'S LOT
NO NO KITTY BROKE IN
HE NEVER STOLE THAT MONEY KNOW HE DI N HE THREATENED TO FALL ASLEEP NOW BUT THE REPORTER WAS ALL ALERT HE SCENTED A STORY BY JOVE HE EXCLAIMED DID YOU HEAR THAT
AND HALF HIDDEN BY A FULL MUSTACHE THAT MADE MUCH FORGIVABLE TO BEAUTY LOVING EYES IT WAS GENERALLY CONCEDED
THAT MADE HIM SEE EVERYTHING WRONG AS HE SAT THERE TO NIGHT HE GAVE TO ALL HE SAW A WRONG VALUE AND UPON IT BASED HIS IGNORANT DESIRES WHEN THE MEN OF THE ORCHESTRA FILED IN AND BEGAN TUNING THEIR INSTRUMENTS
AT A TIME WHEN THE DISRUPTION OF THE COUNTRY HAD INVOLVED MOST OF THE MEN OF HIS REGION IN RUIN WITHOUT GIVING ANY ONE GROUND TO CHARGE HIM WITH
MISSUS HAMILTON COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT ALL AND MANY A NIGHT SHE WEPT AND PRAYED OVER THE CHANGE IN THIS CHILD OF HER HEART THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO WORK OR FIGHT FOR THE LETTERS FROM BERRY IN PRISON BECAME FEWER AND FEWER
IT HAD TAKEN BARELY FIVE YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH AN ENTIRE METAMORPHOSIS OF THEIR CHARACTERS IN JOE'S CASE EVEN A SHORTER TIME WAS NEEDED HE WAS SO READY TO GO DOWN THAT IT NEEDED BUT A GENTLE PUSH TO START HIM AND ONCE STARTED
BY THE LETTER OF A ROMANTIC ARTIST OR THE RAVINGS OF A MADMAN THERE WAS A MIGHTY OUTCRY AGAINST THE FARCE OF JUSTICE THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED OUT IN THIS MAN'S CASE
CLAIRE WAS LOOKING AT HER COMPANION HAD HE MEANT THE APPROVAL OF THE WOMEN OR WAS IT ONE WOMAN THAT HE CARED FOR HAD THE SPEECH HAD A HIDDEN MEANING FOR HER
BUT HATTIE WAS GOING ON ABOUT HER WORK AND EVIDENTLY KNEW NOTHING OH YOU NEED N'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW HER SHE WENT ON BANTERINGLY
HE DON'T WANT IT AND BERRY HAMILTON'S LIFE IN PRISON HAS PROVED NEARER THE IDEAL REACHED BY SLAVERY THAN ANYTHING HE HAS FOUND SINCE EMANCIPATION WHY SUHS
A CORPORATION HE ARGUED HAD NO SOUL AND THEREFORE NO CONSCIENCE HOW MUCH LESS THEN SHOULD SO SMALL A PART OF A GREAT CORPORATION AS HIMSELF
BUT HE SOON TIRED OF BEING SEPARATED FROM HATTIE AND STRAIGHTENED UP AGAIN AFTER SOME DEMUR SHE RECEIVED HIM UPON HIS FORMER FOOTING IT WAS ONLY FOR A FEW MONTHS HE FELL AGAIN FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS THIS HAD HAPPENED INTERMITTENTLY
PUT BEHIND HIM THE BERRY HAMILTON THAT LAUGHED AND JOKED AND SANG AND BELIEVED FOR EVEN HIS FAITH
HE WAS GOING TO MARRY HER BUT HE HAD NEVER RENEWED THIS DECLARATION WHEN IT CAME TIME THAT IT WOULD CARRY WEIGHT WITH IT THEY MADE A FINE PICTURE AS THEY SAT TOGETHER TO NIGHT
AND RE ENTERED THE ROOM WITH HIS BROTHER IN A FEW MINUTES HIS GAIETY HAD APPARENTLY RETURNED WHEN THEY REJOINED THE LADIES EVEN THEIR QUICK EYES COULD DETECT IN HIS DEMEANOUR
BUT DON'T LET S TALK OF IT NOW COME
SHE STRUGGLED THEY HELD HER HER EYES PRAYED TO HIS BUT HIS WERE THE FIRE OF HELL SHE FELL BACK UPON HER PILLOW IN SILENCE HE HAD NOT UTTERED A WORD HE HELD HER
HER MIND WAS NOT QUIET AGAIN HOWEVER UNTIL THE PEOPLE WERE ALL IN THEIR SEATS AND THE CURTAIN HAD GONE UP ON THE SECOND ACT AT FIRST SHE WAS SURPRISED AT THE ENTHUSIASM OVER JUST SUCH DANCING AS SHE COULD SEE ANY DAY FROM THE LOAFERS ON THE STREET CORNERS DOWN HOME
AND THEN LIKE A GOOD SENSIBLE HUMBLE WOMAN
FIVE YEARS IS BUT A SHORT TIME IN THE LIFE OF A MAN AND YET MANY THINGS MAY HAPPEN THEREIN FOR INSTANCE THE WHOLE WAY OF A FAMILY'S LIFE MAY BE CHANGED GOOD NATURES MAY BE MADE INTO BAD ONES
WITH A RARE GENIUS FOR ADAPTING HIMSELF TO NEW CONDITIONS HE ACCEPTED THE CHANGED ORDER OF THINGS WITH A PASSIVE RESIGNATION BUT WITH A STERN DETERMINATION TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF ANY GOOD
THIS HE GULPED DOWN AND FOLLOWED WITH ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FOR A WHILE HE STOOD STILL BROODING SILENTLY HIS RED EYES BLINKING AT THE LIGHT THEN HE TURNED ABRUPTLY AND LEFT THE CLUB
ALL THAT HAPPENED NO ONE OF THEM WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO STAND TO LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE ASKED FOR HIS SON AND DAUGHTER AND THEY SHIFTED THEIR RESPONSIBILITY
SHE SAID FINALLY WITH CUTTING SCORN YOU OUGHT TO BE PUT UNDER A GLASS CASE AND PLACED ON EXHIBITION HE GROANED AND HIS HEAD SUNK LOWER A DRUNKEN MAN IS ALWAYS DISARMED
MISTER THOMAS WAS THE ONLY COOL ONE IN THE PARTY HE WAS QUIETLY TAKING STOCK OF HIS YOUNG COMPANION OF HER INNOCENCE AND CHARM SHE WAS A PRETTY GIRL LITTLE AND DAINTY BUT WELL DEVELOPED FOR HER AGE HER HAIR WAS VERY BLACK AND WAVY
TO SAVE ITS TOTTERING REPUTATION IT WOULD NOT SURRENDER BUT IT CAPITULATED AND BERRY HAMILTON WAS PARDONED
MISSUS HAMILTON WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN SHAME AT THE CLOTHES OF SOME OF THE WOMEN AND DELIGHT WITH THE MUSIC HER COMPANION WAS BUSY POINTING OUT WHO THIS AND THAT ACTRESS WAS AND GIVING JELLY LIKE APPRECIATION TO THE DOINGS ON THE STAGE
WHERE SHE REMAINED IN SPITE OF ALL THOMAS'S PALPABLE EFFORTS TO GET HER AWAY FINALLY HE PROPOSED THAT THEY ALL GO TO SUPPER AT ONE OF THE COLOURED CAFES
THAT INSTANTLY PRICKED THE ATTENTION AWAKE HE READ ON WITH INCREASING INTEREST THIS IS GOOD STUFF HE SAID AT THE LAST PAGE
GET OUT OR I LL HAVE YOU TAKEN OUT SHE SPRANG UP IN BED GLARING ANGRILY AT HIM HIS HANDS TWITCHED NERVOUSLY AS IF HER WILL WERE CONQUERING HIM AND HE WERE UNEASY
AND HE WAS STILL A FREQUENT VISITOR AT THE BANNER HE ALWAYS CAME IN ALONE NOW FOR MAUDIE HAD GONE THE WAY OF ALL THE HALF WORLD AND REACHED DEPTHS TO WHICH MISTER SKAGGS'S JOB PREVENTED HIM FROM FOLLOWING HER HOWEVER
AND HIS HANDS SOUGHT EACH OTHER WHILE THE FINGERS TWITCHED OVER ONE ANOTHER LIKE COILING SERPENTS YOU PUT ME OUT YOU YOU AND YOU MADE ME WHAT I AM
IN AN HOUR AFTER HE HAD RECEIVED HIS TELEGRAM HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE SOUTHERN CAPITAL MEANWHILE IN THE HOUSE OF MAURICE OAKLEY THERE WERE SAD TIMES
IN THIS WAY IT MANAGED TO DO A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF GOOD AND ITS YELLOWNESS BECAME FORGIVABLE EVEN COMMENDABLE IN SKAGGS'S STORY THE EDITOR SAW
AND BEGAN TO SING YOU LL HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER BABY NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME HE LOOKED UP AND HIS EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS TEARS BOTH OF GRIEF AND INTOXICATION THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION OF A WHIPPED DOG ON HIS FACE
BUT TAKE THE SAME CHEESE CLOTH PUT A LITTLE WATER STARCH INTO IT AND PUT IT ON THE STAGE AND SHE COULD SEE ONLY CHIFFON SHE TURNED AROUND AND NODDED DELIGHTEDLY AT HER BROTHER BUT HE DID NOT SEE HER HE WAS LOST TRANSFIXED
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ONE OF ITS PERIODICAL PHILANTHROPIES HE SEIZED UPON IT WITH HEADLINES THAT TOOK HALF A PAGE AND WITH CUTS AUTHENTIC AND OTHERWISE
KITTY DID NOT LIKE THE ARRANGEMENT AND INNOCENTLY SUGGESTED THAT HER BROTHER TAKE HER SEAT WHILE SHE WENT BACK TO HER MOTHER
AND ACTED IN MOST THINGS AS A SOUND SENSIBLE BEING THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WENT DOWN AGAIN AND WENT DOWN BADLY SHE KEPT HER PROMISE AND THREW HIM OVER
HE WENT FORTH AT ONCE TO CELEBRATE HIS VICTORY HE DID NOT RETURN TO HER FOR THREE DAYS THEN HE WAS BATTERED UNKEMPT AND THICK OF SPEECH SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN SILENT CONTEMPT FOR A WHILE AS HE SAT NURSING HIS ACHING HEAD
STILL HE CREPT SLOWLY TOWARDS HER HIS LIPS WORKING AND HIS HANDS MOVING CONVULSIVELY JOE JOE SHE SAID HOARSELY WHAT S THE MATTER
THEY TREATED HER WITH A HALF COURTEOUS FAMILIARITY THAT MADE HER BLUSH HER MOTHER WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE MANY ACQUAINTANCES THAT HER DAUGHTER WAS MAKING
BUT DON'T YOU SEE WHAT SHE CAN DO FOR US MA SHE KNOWS PEOPLE THAT I KNOW AND SHE CAN RUIN ME WITH THEM I AIN'T NEVER BOWED MY HAID TO MINTY BROWN
HE NO LONGER LOOKED TO RECEIVE KINDNESS FROM HIS FELLOWS AND HE BLINKED AT IT
THE BEEF IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE PRIZES OR AS THEY ARE COMMONLY TERMED FIVE QUARTERS THE HIDE AND TALLOW COUNTING AS ONE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR A SIXTH WAS ADDED THE LEAD WHICH WAS SHOT IN THE MATCH
AND GIVE HIM THE PLEASURE OF AN EVENING'S CHAT ABOUT OLD TIMES HIS HOUSE SHOULD BE AS FREE TO ME AS MY OWN BUT I COULD NOT ACCEPT HIS HOSPITALITY WITHOUT RETRACING FIVE OR SIX MILES OF THE ROAD WHICH I HAD ALREADY PASSED AND THEREFORE I DECLINED IT WELL IF YOU WON'T GO
TO BE SURE I WILL MY OLD COON TAKE IT TAKE IT AND WELCOME ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT ME YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE
SO MUCH KEENER IS THE VISION OF A PRACTICED THAN AN UNPRACTICED EYE THE NEXT IN ORDER WAS HIRAM BAUGH HIRAM WAS LIKE SOME RACE HORSES WHICH I HAVE SEEN HE WAS TOO GOOD NOT TO CONTEND FOR EVERY PRIZE AND TOO GOOD FOR NOTHING EVER TO WIN ONE
SAID THE SQUIRE CHUCKLING THERE
HE JUDGED BY THE LAW OF PROCRUSTES AND PERMITTED NO APPEALS OPINIONATED AND ARBITRARY AS THE CZAR HE WAS SAUCED BY HIS NEGROES RESPECTED AND LOVED BY HIS NEIGHBORS LED BY THE NOSE BY HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS AND THE ABJECT SLAVE OF HIS GRANDCHILDREN
A DARN SIGHT CLEVERER FELLOW THAN HE LOOKS TO BE
AS SOON AS I FOUND THAT SOAP STICK WAS HIGH ENOUGH FOR I MADE NO FARTHER USE OF THE SIGHTS THAN TO ASCERTAIN THIS FACT
THE SQUIRE WAS FRANTIC WITH RAGE THE CAUSE OF WHICH OUR HERO HAVING SEEN SOMETHING OF THE AFFRAY EASILY DIVINED HE WAS UNWILLING HOWEVER TO TRUST HIS HAIR TRIGGERED PIECE IN THE HANDS OF HIS EXCITED HOST
TELL YOU WHAT STRANGER SAID ONE YOU'RE TOO HARD FOR US ALL HERE WE NEVER HEARN O THAT SORT O SHOOT'N IN THESE PARTS WELL RETURNED I YOU'VE SEEN IT NOW AND I'M THE BOY THAT CAN DO IT
FIVE SHOTS REMAINED UNDISPOSED OF HOW MANY SHOTS LEFT INQUIRED BILLY FIVE WAS THE REPLY WELL I TAKE EM ALL PUT DOWN FOUR SHOTS TO ME AND ONE TO LYMAN HALL
DID YOU CALL A SHEEP A PEACEFUL ANIMAL I TELL YOU SIR IT IS THE MOST FEROCIOUS AND UNRULY BEAST IN EXISTENCE SIR I HAD A RAM ONCE MY DEAR SIR CRIED THE ASTONISHED LECTURER ON THE AUTHORITY OF OUR MOST DISTINGUISHED WRITERS
AND IT IS PRESUMABLE THE DAY WOUND UP WITH A SPREE AFTER THE SQUIRE GOT OLDER AND A FAMILY GREW UP AROUND HIM HE WAS NOT ALWAYS VICTORIOUS IN HIS CONTESTS FOR EXAMPLE A QUESTION LATELY AROSE ABOUT THE REFURNISHING OF THE HOUSE
NO GREAT HARM DONE YET SAID SPIVEY MANIFESTLY RELIEVED FROM ANXIETY BY AN EVENT WHICH SEEMED TO ME BETTER CALCULATED TO PRODUCE DESPAIR FIRMBY'S BALL HAD CUT OUT THE LOWER ANGLE OF THE DIAMOND DIRECTLY ON A RIGHT LINE WITH THE CROSS
NOW I KNOW YOU'RE THE VERY CHAP FOR I HEARD DADDY TELL THAT VERY THING ABOUT THE HALF BULLET DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT LYMAN AND DARN MY OLD SHOES IF I DON'T TARE THE LINT OFF THE BOYS WITH YOU AT THE SHOOTING MATCH
IF THE SHOOTING MATCH IS NOT TOO FAR OUT OF MY WAY I'LL GO TO IT WITH PLEASURE UNLESS YOUR WAY LIES THROUGH THE WOODS FROM HERE SAID BILLY IT'LL NOT BE MUCH OUT OF YOUR WAY FOR IT'S ONLY A MILE AHEAD OF US AND THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD FOR YOU TO TAKE TILL YOU GET THERE
GO LONG YOU OLD COON SAID BILLY I SEE WHAT YOU'RE AT INTIMATING THAT ALL THIS WAS MERELY TO MAKE THE COMING SHOT THE MORE REMARKABLE DADDY'S LITTLE BOY DON'T SHOOT ANYTHING BUT THE OLD SOAP STICK HERE TO DAY I KNOW
GREASE SIDE DOWN PLACED HIS BALL UPON IT PRESSED IT A LITTLE THEN TOOK IT UP AND TURNED THE NECK A LITTLE MORE PERPENDICULARLY DOWNWARD PLACED HIS KNIFE HANDLE ON IT JUST BURIED IT IN THE MOUTH OF THE RIFLE CUT OFF THE REDUNDANT PATCHING JUST ABOVE THE BULLET LOOKED AT IT
AND IF SHE DON'T GO THERE DANG OLD ROPER I TOOK HOLD OF SOAP STICK AND LAPSED IMMEDIATELY INTO THE MOST HOPELESS DESPAIR I AM SURE I NEVER HANDLED AS HEAVY A GUN IN ALL MY LIFE WHY BILLY SAID I YOU LITTLE MORTAL YOU
THE LAWYERS JUSTICES AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT FELT DISPOSED TO DINE AT DICK'S RIGHT ELBOW SAT A MILITIA COLONEL WHO WAS TRICKED OUT IN ALL THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE ADMITTED BY HIS RANK
TO WHICH I LISTENED WITH QUITE AS MUCH ASTONISHMENT AS ANY OTHER ONE OF HIS HEARERS
THAT HE WAS GOING TO A SHOOTING MATCH THAT HE CALLED HIS RIFLE THE SOAP STICK AND THAT HE WAS VERY CONFIDENT OF WINNING BEEF WITH HER OR WHICH IS NEARLY BUT NOT QUITE THE SAME THING DRIVING THE CROSS WITH HER WELL SAID I
AS HIS FATHER HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM WE SOON REACHED THE PLACE APPOINTED FOR THE SHOOTING MATCH IT WENT BY THE NAME OF SIMS'S CROSS ROADS BECAUSE HERE TWO ROADS INTERSECTED EACH OTHER
THE JUDGES I KNEW WERE BECOMING IMPATIENT AND WITHAL MY SITUATION WAS GROWING MORE EMBARRASSING EVERY SECOND SO I E E N RESOLVED TO TRY THE SOAP STICK WITHOUT FURTHER PARLEY I STEPPED OUT AND THE MOST INTENSE INTEREST WAS EXCITED ALL AROUND ME
BUT IT ANSWERED THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS PUT WHICH WAS ONLY TO DRAW HIM INTO CONVERSATION
SHE HAD NOT ONLY PASSED THE TARGET BUT WAS MAKING RAPID ENCROACHMENTS ON MY OWN TOES
IT WAS ALTOGETHER A CHANCE SHOT THAT MADE ME WIN BEEF BUT THAT WASN'T GENERALLY KNOWN AND MOST EVERYBODY BELIEVED THAT I WAS CARRIED THERE ON ACCOUNT OF MY SKILL IN SHOOTING AND MY FAME WAS SPREAD FAR AND WIDE I WELL REMEMBER I REMEMBER TOO PERFECTLY WELL
HIS RIFLE WAS ALREADY CHARGED AND HE FIXED IT UPON THE TARGET WITH A STEADINESS OF NERVE AND AIM THAT WAS ASTONISHING TO ME AND ALARMING TO ALL THE REST A FEW SECONDS AND THE REPORT OF HIS RIFLE BROKE THE DEATHLIKE SILENCE WHICH PREVAILED
THE MOST OF WHOM WERE MORE OR LESS OBEDIENT TO THE CALL OF MEALY WHITECOTTON FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE SELF CONSTITUTED COMMANDER IN CHIEF SOME HASTENED AND SOME LOITERED AS THEY DESIRED TO BE FIRST OR LAST ON THE LIST
AND IN THIS COURSE I RARELY FAIL TO PLEASE HOW'S THE OLD WOMAN
WE ARE SORRY TO LEARN THAT AMONG THIS CROWD WERE LAWYERS SHERIFFS MAGISTRATES AND CONSTABLES AND THAT EVEN HIS HONOR THE JUDGE FORGETTING HIS DIGNITY AND POSITION SHOUTED IN A LOUD VOICE GIVE IT TO HIM DICK HARDY THERE'S NO LAW IN CHRISTENDOM AGAINST BASTING A MAN WITH A ROAST PIG
THE WHOLE OF MY PARTY RUSHED TO THE TARGET TO HAVE THE EVIDENCE OF THEIR SENSES BEFORE THEY WOULD BELIEVE THE REPORT BUT MOST MARVELOUS FORTUNE DECREED THAT IT SHOULD BE TRUE THEIR INCREDULITY AND ASTONISHMENT WERE MOST FORTUNATE FOR ME FOR THEY BLINDED MY HEARERS TO THE REAL FEELINGS
MEALY RAISED AND FIRED A PRETTY GOOD SHOT MEALY SAID ONE YES A BLAMED GOOD SHOT SAID A SECOND WELL DONE MEAL SAID A THIRD I WAS REJOICED WHEN ONE OF THE COMPANY INQUIRED WHERE IS IT
AND SEE ME KNOCK OUT THE BULL'S EYE WITH HER A FEW TIMES YOU'LL AGREE THE OLD SOAP STICK'S WORTH SOMETHING WHEN BILLY CURLEW PUTS HIS SHOULDER TO HER THIS SHORT SENTENCE WAS REPLETE WITH INFORMATION TO ME IT TAUGHT ME THAT MY COMPANION WAS BILLY CURLEW
I WAS TRAVELING IN ONE OF THE NORTHEASTERN COUNTIES WHEN I OVERTOOK A SWARTHY BRIGHT EYED SMIRKY LITTLE FELLOW RIDING A SMALL PONY AND BEARING ON HIS SHOULDER A LONG HEAVY RIFLE WHICH JUDGING FROM ITS LOOKS I SHOULD SAY HAD DONE SERVICE IN MORGAN'S CORPS
SHOOTING MATCHES ARE PROBABLY NEARLY COEVAL WITH THE COLONIZATION OF GEORGIA THEY ARE STILL COMMON THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHERN STATES THOUGH THEY ARE NOT AS COMMON AS THEY WERE TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY YEARS AGO CHANCE LED ME TO ONE ABOUT A YEAR AGO
HAD I BEEN KING OF THE CAT TRIBE THEY COULD NOT HAVE REGARDED ME WITH MORE CURIOUS ATTENTION THAN DID THE WHOLE COMPANY FROM THIS MOMENT EVERY INCH OF ME WAS EXAMINED WITH THE NICEST SCRUTINY AND SOME PLAINLY EXPRESSED BY THEIR LOOKS THAT THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME FOR SUCH A BITE
AND DRAW A BEAD UPON THE BULL'S EYE YOU GWINE TO SEE FUN HERE TO DAY DON'T SAY NOTHING ABOUT IT
NEVER PRACTICED SHOOTING WITH THE DOUBLE WABBLE IT'S THE GREATEST TAKE IN THE WORLD WHEN YOU LEARN TO DRIVE THE CROSS WITH IT ANOTHER SORT FOR GETTING BETS UPON TO THE DROP SIGHT WITH A SINGLE WABBLE AND THE SOAP STICK'S THE VERY YARN FOR IT
I THANKED THEM KINDLY BUT REPEATED MY ASSURANCES THE READER WILL NOT SUPPOSE THAT THE DISTRICT TOOK ITS NAME FROM THE CHARACTER OF THE INHABITANTS
HE WAS LEANING AGAINST THE GREYHOUND HE ONLY LOOKED AT THE AUDIENCE I AM NOT QUITE SURE SHE COUGHED IF NOW YOU WERE UNDER A GLASS CASE
IT WAS SOON ASCERTAINED THAT NOT MORE THAN TWENTY PERSONS WOULD TAKE CHANCES BUT THESE TWENTY AGREED TO TAKE THE NUMBER OF SHOTS AT TWENTY FIVE CENTS EACH
SAID THE STEADFAST BOY LEANING AGAINST A GREYHOUND AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE CAT GO AWAY SAID THE PARIAN GIRL ANGRILY YOU'RE ALL HATEFUL I WON'T HAVE YOU AH SIGHED THE BOY LEANING AGAINST A GREYHOUND
SAID BILLY AS THE SMOKE ROSE FROM BEFORE HIS EYE YOU'VE JIST TOUCHED THE CROSS ON THE LOWER SIDE WAS THE REPLY OF ONE OF THE JUDGES I WAS AFRAID I WAS DRAWING MY BEAD A LEETLE TOO FINE SAID BILLY NOW LYMAN YOU SEE WHAT THE SOAP STICK CAN DO
SHE WAS THE CHINA GIRL THAT ROSE OUT OF A PEN WIPER THE FIRE IN THE GRATE BELOW WAS OF SOFT COAL AND FLASHED UP AND DOWN
THAT NONE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY SHOULD MARRY WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT OR COUNCIL
AND REGARDED THEIR OWN MODEL AS THE ONLY ONE WHICH CORRESPONDED IN ANY DEGREE TO SUCH A DESCRIPTION BUT THAT ABLE POLITICIAN HAD OTHER VIEWS AND WHILE HE EMPLOYED HIS GREAT TALENTS IN OVERREACHING THE PRESBYTERIANS AND SECRETLY LAUGHED AT THEIR SIMPLICITY
OFFER BATTLE TO THE KING CHARLES CHOSE HIS POST AT NEWBURY WHERE THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMIES UNDER THE EARL OF MANCHESTER ATTACKED HIM WITH GREAT VIGOR AND THAT TOWN WAS A SECOND TIME THE SCENE OF THE BLOODY ANIMOSITIES OF THE ENGLISH
HE WAS APT TO ASCRIBE THEM IN A GREAT MEASURE TO HIS OWN INDOLENCE AND FACILITY THE QUEEN AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FURTHER STIMULATED HIS PASSION AND REPRESENTED THAT
AND SOUGHT ASSISTANCE FOR THE FINISHING OF THAT ENTERPRISE IN WHICH THEIR OWN FORCES EXPERIENCED SUCH FURIOUS OPPOSITION THE PARLIAMENT HAD RECOURSE TO SCOTLAND
ATTENDED BY A FEW LIVERY SERVANTS THE INTELLIGENCE WAS CONVEYED TO LONDON AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY VOTED THAT HE HAD APPEARED IN A HOSTILE MANNER TO THE TERROR AND AFFRIGHT OF HIS MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS
THE EARL OF LANERIC NOW DUKE OF HAMILTON
HAVING JOINED CROMWELL AND YOUNG FAIRFAX OBTAINED A CONSIDERABLE VICTORY OVER THE ROYALISTS AT HORNCASTLE WHERE THE TWO OFFICERS LAST MENTIONED GAINED RENOWN BY THEIR CONDUCT AND GALLANTRY AND THOUGH FORTUNE HAD THUS BALANCED HER FAVORS
BUT THOUGH HE HAD USUALLY PROFESSED HIMSELF APPREHENSIVE OF A VIOLENT DEATH HE FOUND ALL HIS FEARS TO BE DISSIPATED BEFORE THAT SUPERIOR COURAGE BY WHICH HE WAS ANIMATED NO ONE SAID HE CAN BE MORE WILLING TO SEND ME OUT OF LIFE THAN I AM DESIROUS TO GO
AND THE LEAST FAVORABLE CENSORS OF HIS MERIT ALLOWED THAT THE FIDELITY AND SERVICES OF A WHOLE LIFE HAD SUFFICIENTLY ATONED FOR ONE RASH ACTION INTO WHICH HIS PASSION HAD BETRAYED HIM PRINCE RUPERT WITH EQUAL PRECIPITATION
EVERY MAN HAD FRAMED THE MODEL OF A REPUBLIC AND HOWEVER NEW IT WAS OR FANTASTICAL HE WAS EAGER IN RECOMMENDING IT TO HIS FELLOW CITIZENS OR EVEN IMPOSING IT BY FORCE UPON THEM
THEY COMPLAINED OF THE KING'S FILLING FIVE VACANT SEES AND CONSIDERED IT AS AN INSULT UPON THEM
NOT TO THE DEATH OF THE REDEEMER HAVING EXTRICATED HIMSELF FROM THESE THEOLOGICAL TOILS THE ARCHBISHOP LAID HIS HEAD ON THE BLOCK AND IT WAS SEVERED FROM THE BODY AT ONE BLOW THOSE RELIGIOUS OPINIONS FOR WHICH HE SUFFERED
AND ONLY DESIRED LEAVE WITH MY OWN BRIGADE OF HORSE TO CHARGE THE KING'S ARMY IN THEIR RETREAT LEAVING IT IN THE EARL'S CHOICE IF HE THOUGHT PROPER
AND THAT IN CIVIL AFFAIRS HE SHOULD ENTIRELY CONFORM HIMSELF TO THE DIRECTION OF PARLIAMENT AND IN ECCLESIASTICAL TO THAT OF THE ASSEMBLY THESE PROPOSALS THE COMMISSIONERS AFTER PASSING SOME TIME IN SERMONS AND PRAYERS
IN THESE RIGID OPINIONS THE WHOLE SECTARIES AMIDST ALL THEIR OTHER DIFFERENCES UNANIMOUSLY CONCURRED THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE INDEPENDENTS KEPT PACE WITH THEIR RELIGIOUS NOT CONTENT WITH CONFINING TO VERY NARROW LIMITS THE POWER OF THE CROWN
AND HE NEVER APPEARED GREATER THAN WHEN PLUNGED INTO THE DEEPEST PERILS AND DISTRESSES FROM THE MIXED CHARACTER INDEED OF CHARLES AROSE IN PART THE MISFORTUNES IN WHICH ENGLAND WAS AT THIS TIME INVOLVED
A ZEALOT OF THE REIGNING SECT AND A GREAT LEADER IN THE LOWER HOUSE THIS WAS THE TIME HE CHOSE FOR EXAMINING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE DYING PRIMATE AND TREPANNING HIM INTO A CONFESSION THAT HE TRUSTED FOR HIS SALVATION TO THE MERITS OF GOOD WORKS
THE KING WAS BETRAYED INTO ANOTHER INDISCRETION MUCH MORE FATAL AN INDISCRETION TO WHICH ALL THE ENSUING DISORDERS AND CIVIL WARS OUGHT IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY TO BE ASCRIBED
THEY EXCITED AFRESH THEIR PREACHERS TO FURIOUS DECLAMATIONS AGAINST THE ROYAL CAUSE THEY EVEN EMPLOYED THE EXPEDIENT OF PRESSING THOUGH ABOLISHED BY A LATE LAW FOR WHICH THEY HAD STRENUOUSLY CONTENDED
AND EACH ARMY OCCUPIED THE GROUND WHICH HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY THE ENEMY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY THIS SECOND BATTLE WAS EQUALLY FURIOUS AND DESPERATE WITH THE FIRST BUT AFTER THE UTMOST EFFORTS OF COURAGE BY BOTH PARTIES
AND HE THOUGHT HIMSELF BOUND BY MORE SACRED TIES THAN THOSE OF POLICY OR EVEN OF HONOR TO THE SUPPORT OF THAT ORDER HIS CONCESSIONS THEREFORE ON THIS HEAD
AND CONSIDERED HIM AS A PRINCE ENGAGED BY INTEREST AS WELL AS INCLINATION TO SUPPORT THEM THAT SO LONG AS THEIR PARTY SUBSISTED CHARLES MIGHT RELY ON THEIR ATTACHMENT AS MUCH AS ON THAT OF HIS OWN SUBJECTS BUT IF THEIR LIBERTIES WERE ONCE RAVISHED FROM THEM
THE MECHANIC INDULGING THE FERVORS OF ZEAL AND GUIDED BY THE ILLAPSES OF THE SPIRIT RESIGNED HIMSELF TO AN INWARD AND SUPERIOR DIRECTION AND WAS CONSECRATED IN A MANNER BY AN IMMEDIATE INTERCOURSE AND COMMUNICATION WITH HEAVEN THE CATHOLICS
A COVENANT AS A TEST WAS TAKEN BY THE LORDS AND COMMONS AND IMPOSED ON THEIR ARMY AND ON ALL WHO LIVED WITHIN THEIR QUARTERS BESIDES RESOLVING TO AMEND AND REFORM THEIR LIVES
MUNIFICENT AND GENEROUS IN HIS EXPENSE POLITE AND ELEGANT IN HIS TASTE COURTEOUS AND HUMANE IN HIS BEHAVIOR HE BROUGHT A GREAT ACCESSION OF FRIENDS AND OF CREDIT TO THE PARTY WHICH HE EMBRACED
HAD FOUND NO LEISURE TO FINISH HIS IMPEACHMENT AND HE HAD PATIENTLY ENDURED SO LONG AN IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT BEING BROUGHT TO ANY TRIAL AFTER THE UNION WITH SCOTLAND THE BIGOTED PREJUDICES OF THAT NATION REVIVED THE LIKE SPIRIT IN ENGLAND
AND APPOINTED AN ARMY TO BE LEVIED UNDER HIS COMMAND BUT ABOVE ALL THEY WERE INTENT THAT ESSEX'S ARMY ON WHICH THEIR WHOLE FORTUNE DEPENDED SHOULD BE PUT IN A CONDITION OF MARCHING AGAINST THE KING
AND A VIGOROUS OFFENSIVE WAR BE WAGED AGAINST THESE MIGHTY POTENTATES ERE THEY WOULD RESIGN A PRINCIPALITY WHICH THEY HAD NOW FULLY SUBDUED AND WHICH THEY HELD IN SECURE POSSESSION BY ITS BEING SURROUNDED WITH ALL THEIR OTHER TERRITORIES
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THEY THOUGHT WHEN ALL THESE PRETENSIONS WERE METHODISED AND PROSECUTED BY THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGE TO MAINTAIN ANY SHADOW OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SUCH UNLIMITED AUTHORITY IN THE SOVEREIGN
LAUD AND HIS ASSOCIATES BY REVIVING A FEW PRIMITIVE INSTITUTIONS OF THIS NATURE CORRECTED THE ERROR OF THE FIRST REFORMERS AND PRESENTED TO THE AFFRIGHTENED AND ASTONISHED MIND SOME SENSIBLE EXTERIOR OBSERVANCES
AS WELL FOR THE SECURITY OF THE IRISH PROTESTANTS AS FOR PROMOTING HIS INTERESTS IN ENGLAND THE PARLIAMENT IN ORDER TO BLACKEN HIS CONDUCT REPROACHED HIM WITH FAVORING THAT ODIOUS REBELLION
THE SAME SEVERITY WAS EXERCISED AS AT TREDAH EVERY TOWN BEFORE WHICH CROMWELL PRESENTED HIMSELF NOW OPENED ITS GATES WITHOUT RESISTANCE ROSS THOUGH STRONGLY GARRISONED WAS SURRENDERED BY LORD TAFFE HAVING TAKEN ESTIONAGE
BRERETON AND MANY OTHERS RESIGNED THEIR COMMANDS AND RECEIVED THE THANKS OF PARLIAMENT FOR THEIR GOOD SERVICES
HE DARED TO CARRY HIS AMBITIOUS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN HERSELF AND HE FAILED NOT TO MAKE IMPRESSION ON A HEART NOT UNDISPOSED TO THE TENDER PASSIONS THAT ATTACHMENT AT LEAST OF THE MIND WHICH APPEARS SO DELICIOUS AND IS SO DANGEROUS
BEDFORD HOLLAND AND CONWAY HAD DESERTED THE PARLIAMENT AND HAD GONE TO OXFORD CLARE AND LOVELACE HAD FOLLOWED THEM
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SET BOUNDS TO THESE HOLY FERVORS OR CONFINE WITHIN ANY NATURAL LIMITS WHAT WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS AN INFINITE AND A SUPERNATURAL OBJECT EVERY MAN AS PROMPTED BY THE WARMTH OF HIS TEMPER
THESE TROOPS SO LONG AS THEY WERE ALLOWED TO REMAIN WERE USEFUL BY DIVERTING THE FORCE OF THE IRISH REBELS AND PROTECTING IN THE NORTH THE SMALL REMNANTS OF THE BRITISH PLANTERS BUT EXCEPT THIS CONTRACT WITH THE SCOTTISH NATION
AND OPERATIONS IN THE FIELD CONCURRING IN THE SAME PERNICIOUS END WITH DELIBERATIONS IN THE CABINET
THE SUM WAS LITTLE PROPORTIONED TO THE GREATNESS OF THE OCCASION AND ILL FITTED TO PROMOTE THOSE VIEWS OF SUCCESS AND GLORY FOR WHICH THE YOUNG PRINCE IN HIS FIRST ENTERPRISE SO ARDENTLY LONGED BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS NOT THE MOST DISAGREEABLE ONE
AS TO A VERY IMPORTANT SCENE OF ACTION
THOUGH IT MUST BE REMARKED THAT THE CONNECTIONS WITH THAT CROWN WERE MUCH LESS OBNOXIOUS TO THE PROTESTANTS AND LESS AGREEABLE TO THE CATHOLICS THAN THE ALLIANCE FORMERLY PROJECTED WITH SPAIN AND WERE THEREFORE RECEIVED RATHER WITH PLEASURE THAN DISSATISFACTION
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HAVE I VIOLATED YOUR LAWS HAVE I DENIED TO PASS ANY BILL FOR THE EASE AND SECURITY OF MY SUBJECTS I DO NOT ASK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME
HAS THE SAME AUTHORITY AS A PARLIAMENT IN RAISING MONEY AND LEVYING FORCES HAMILTON AND HIS BROTHER THE EARL OF LANERIC WHO HAD BEEN SENT INTO SCOTLAND IN ORDER TO OPPOSE THESE MEASURES WANTED EITHER AUTHORITY OR SINCERITY
WHOSE STATE CAN NEITHER FLATTERERS FEED NOR RUIN MAKE ACCUSERS GREAT WHO GOD DOTH LATE AND EARLY PRAY MORE OF HIS GRACE THAN GIFTS TO LEND AND ENTERTAINS THE HARMLESS DAY WITH A WELL CHOSEN BOOK OR FRIEND

EVEN FOR THE LEAST DIVISION OF AN HOUR HAVE I BEEN SO BEGUILED AS TO BE BLIND TO MY MOST GRIEVOUS LOSS THAT THOUGHT'S RETURN WAS THE WORST PANG THAT SORROW EVER BORE SAVE ONE
MIGHT BE CLAIMED WITH PERHAPS EQUAL JUSTICE FOR A NARRATIVE OR DESCRIPTIVE SELECTION WHILST WITH REFERENCE ESPECIALLY TO BALLADS AND SONNETS THE EDITOR CAN ONLY STATE THAT HE HAS TAKEN HIS UTMOST PAINS TO DECIDE WITHOUT CAPRICE

NOT MANY APPEAR TO HAVE GAINED REPUTATION WITHOUT SOME GIFT OR PERFORMANCE THAT IN DUE DEGREE DESERVED IT AND IF NO VERSES BY CERTAIN WRITERS WHO SHOW LESS STRENGTH THAN SWEETNESS
OR LOOKING AT THE POETS WHO MORE OR LESS GIVE EACH PORTION ITS DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER THEY MIGHT BE CALLED THE BOOKS OF SHAKESPEARE MILTON GRAY AND WORDSWORTH THE VOLUME IN THIS RESPECT
BUT I BY BACKWARD STEPS WOULD MOVE AND WHEN THIS DUST FALLS TO THE URN IN THAT STATE I CAME RETURN H VAUGHAN
THAT HE HAS FOUND THE VAGUE GENERAL VERDICT OF POPULAR FAME MORE JUST THAN THOSE HAVE THOUGHT WHO WITH TOO SEVERE A CRITICISM WOULD CONFINE JUDGMENTS ON POETRY TO THE SELECTED FEW OF MANY GENERATIONS

TWELVE YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE I LAST TOOK A VIEW OF MY FAVOURITE FIELD AND THE BANK WHERE THEY GREW AND NOW IN THE GRASS BEHOLD THEY ARE LAID AND THE TREE IS MY SEAT
LIKE TWILIGHT'S TOO HER DUSKY HAIR BUT ALL THINGS ELSE ABOUT HER DRAWN FROM MAY TIME AND THE CHEERFUL DAWN A DANCING SHAPE AN IMAGE GAY TO HAUNT TO STARTLE AND WAYLAY
DAYS THAT IN SPITE OF DARKNESS BY THE LIGHT OF A CLEAR MIND ARE DAY ALL NIGHT LIFE THAT DARES SEND A CHALLENGE TO HIS END AND WHEN IT COMES SAY WELCOME FRIEND

BUT EVERY BODY SAID QUOTH HE THAT TWAS A FAMOUS VICTORY

WITH THEE WERE THE DREAMS OF MY EARLIEST LOVE EVERY THOUGHT OF MY REASON WAS THINE IN MY LAST HUMBLE PRAYER TO THE SPIRIT ABOVE THY NAME SHALL BE MINGLED WITH MINE
DESCENDED TO THE RIVER'S OPEN VIEWING WITH A GREAT TRAIN ENSUING ABOVE THE REST WERE GOODLY TO BE SEEN TWO GENTLE KNIGHTS OF LOVELY FACE AND FEATURE BESEEMING WELL THE BOWER OF ANY QUEEN WITH GIFTS OF WIT AND ORNAMENTS OF NATURE FIT FOR SO GOODLY STATURE

A BELT OF STRAW AND IVY BUDS WITH CORAL CLASPS AND AMBER STUDS AND IF THESE PLEASURES MAY THEE MOVE COME LIVE WITH ME AND BE MY LOVE THY SILVER DISHES FOR THY MEAT
HE THEN BRIEFLY SKETCHED HER CHARACTER AND HER SKILL IN MUSIC BUT ON THE PART OF VIOLET SHE COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT IT WAS CRUEL TO HER TO GIVE AWAY PART OF HIS HEART WHILE HER THOUGHTS WERE WITH NO ONE BUT HIM AND SHE WAS QUITE CAST DOWN FOR SOME TIME
HIS PARTY CONSISTED OF MANY YOUNG NOBLES AND COURT RETAINERS BESIDES HIS OWN PRIVATE ATTENDANTS BY A COINCIDENCE THE MAIDEN OF AKASHI WHO HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM COMING TO THE TEMPLE SINCE THE LAST YEAR HAPPENED TO ARRIVE THERE ON THE SAME DAY
AND THEREFORE BY THE ADVICE OF MY FRIENDS I CAME TO THIS MOUNTAIN TO BE EXORCISED IF HOWEVER THE SPELLS OF THE HOLY MAN ARE OF NO AVAIL TO ME HIS REPUTATION MIGHT SUFFER IN CONSEQUENCE
MANY INTERESTING ANECDOTES AND ALSO SPOKE ELOQUENTLY OF MAN'S FUTURE DESTINY GENJI AS HE HEARD HIM FELT SOME QUALMS OF CONSCIENCE FOR HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS OWN CONDUCT WAS FAR FROM BEING IRREPROACHABLE THE THOUGHT TROUBLED HIM
WHO WAS INTIMATELY KNOWN TO GENJI AND WHO HAD MOST INFLUENCE OVER HIM BUT THE SPIRIT GAVE NO INFORMATION TO THIS EFFECT HENCE SOME EVEN SURMISED THAT THE WANDERING SPIRIT OF SOME AGED NURSE OR THE LIKE
I KNOW NOT HOW IT CAME TO PASS BUT SHE BECAME SECRETLY INTIMATE
BUT AMONG THEM WAS A SPIRIT APPARENTLY A
APPARENTLY BETOKENED THE GOOD TASTE OF ITS INHABITANTS WHOSE HOUSE MAY THAT BE INQUIRED GENJI OF HIS ATTENDANTS THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS A HOUSE IN WHICH A CERTAIN PRIEST HAD BEEN LIVING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AH I KNOW HIM SAID GENJI
THUS AS THEY DEPICTED THEM TO HIM THEY CHEERED AND GLADDENED HIS MIND ONE OF THEM WENT ON TO SAY AMONG SUCH SIGHTS AND AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE IS THE SEA COAST OF AKASHI IN THE PROVINCE OF HARIMA WHICH IS I THINK ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL
LOCAL GOVERNORS WHO HAD BECOME RICH AND HAVING RETURNED FROM DIFFERENT PROVINCES SOUNDED THE PRINCESS TO SEE IF SHE WERE INCLINED TO PART WITH HER RESIDENCE BUT THIS SHE ALWAYS REFUSED TO DO SAYING THAT HOWEVER UNFORTUNATE SHE MIGHT BE
LET US HERE NOTICE THAT THE YOUNG DAUGHTER OF UDAIJIN AFTER SHE SAW GENJI WAS LONGING TO SEE HIM AGAIN THIS INCLINATION WAS PERCEIVED BY HER RELATIONS IT SEEMS
LONG SINCE DEAD STILL HAUNTED THE MANSION AND MIGHT HAVE SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE LADY'S DELICATE HEALTH AND TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER
MADE OF THE HAIR WHICH HAD FALLEN FROM HER OWN HEAD THIS SHE PUT INTO AN OLD CASKET
IF HIS DAUGHTER WERE TO TAKE THE PLACE OF LADY AOI BUT THIS THE ROYAL MOTHER DID NOT APPROVE IT WOULD BE FAR BETTER FOR HER TO BE INTRODUCED AT COURT SHE SAID
THE FOURTH DAUGHTER OF UDAIJIN WAS NOW TWELVE YEARS OLD AND WAS SHORTLY EXPECTED TO BE PRESENTED AT COURT WHILE HIS SON WHO HAD SUNG THE HIGH SAND AT A SUMMER DAY REUNION AT GENJI'S MANSION RECEIVED A TITLE
IN THE WESTERN ANTECHAMBER OF THE HOUSE WAS PLACED AN IMAGE OF BUDDHA AND HERE AN EVENING SERVICE WAS PERFORMED A NUN RAISING A CURTAIN BEFORE BUDDHA OFFERED A GARLAND OF FLOWERS ON THE ALTAR AND PLACING A KIO OR SUTRA
SENIOR SECRETARY TO THE LORD LIEUTENANT AND THEY WERE TO GO DOWN TO TZKUSHI
AND SHE THEN REMAINED SILENT FOR A WHILE AT LAST THINKING IT WOULD BE UNBECOMING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF IT SHE GAVE ORALLY THE FOLLOWING REPLY TO THE ATTENDANT TO BE GIVEN TO GENJI YOU SAY YOUR SLEEVE IS WET WITH DEW
AND GENJI LEFT HER IN ORDER TO ATTEND THE COURT WHEN HE SAID GOOD BY TO HER THERE WAS A STRANGE AND UNUSUAL LOOK IN HER EYES SADAIJIN ALSO WENT TO COURT AS WELL AS HIS SONS
SO SAYING HE SMILED A LITTLE AND SHARP
THAT THERE IS NO ONE HERE TO WHOM SUCH THINGS CAN BE PRESENTED BELIEVE ME I HAVE MY OWN REASONS FOR THIS SAID GENJI LET ME BESEECH YOU TO TAKE IT SO THE ATTENDANT WENT BACK AND PRESENTED IT TO THE NUN
SHE WAS LEFT UNTOUCHED DURING TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT REVIVE BUT NO CHANGE TOOK PLACE AND NOW ALL HOPE WAS ABANDONED IN DUE COURSE THE CORPSE WAS TAKEN TO THE CEMETERY OF TORIBENO
BUT IT IS SIMPLY FOOLISH TO ABANDON ONE'S SELF AND TO BURY ONE'S LIFE UNDER SUCH A MASS OF DILAPIDATION
AND GENJI THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO INFORM HER FATHER ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER BUT HE CONSIDERED HE HAD BETTER HAVE THE CEREMONY OF MOGI FIRST PERFORMED AND ORDERED PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE WITH THAT OBJECT
HE ENJOYS CONSIDERABLE POPULARITY AND RESPECT HIS RESIDENCE MOREOVER IS WELL APPOINTED AND OF SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE AND HE PERFORMS WITH PUNCTUALITY AND DEVOUTNESS HIS RELIGIOUS DUTIES NAY ALMOST WITH MORE EARNESTNESS
THE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO TAKE A SHARE IN THE PROCESSION ON THIS OCCASION IS DEFINED BY REGULATIONS YET THE SELECTION OF THIS NUMBER WAS MOST CAREFULLY MADE FROM THE MOST FASHIONABLE OF THE NOBLES OF THE TIME
TIS BUT ONE NIGHT ALONE FOR YOU BUT THERE'S A MOUNTAIN MOSS GROWS NIGH WHOSE LEAVES FROM DEW ARE NEVER DRY WHEN GENJI HEARD THIS HE SAID
WHEN I WENT DOWN THERE LAST TIME I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FAMILY AND I FOUND THAT THOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN WELL RECEIVED IN THE CAPITAL YET THAT HERE HAVING BEEN FORMERLY GOVERNOR
THE PRIEST SAID THIS WITH A GRAVE AND EVEN A STERN EXPRESSION ON HIS COUNTENANCE WHICH CAUSED GENJI TO DROP THE SUBJECT HE THEN ASKED THE PRINCE TO EXCUSE HIM FOR IT WAS THE HOUR FOR VESPERS AND AS HE QUITTED THE ROOM TO ATTEND THE SERVICE
WE COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH EACH OTHER TWAS TO REVEAL THESE WISHES TO YOU THAT I CAME HERE AND RISKED THE CHANCE OF OFFENDING YOU IN DOING SO BELIEVE ME I AM WELL DISPOSED AT YOUR OFFER SAID THE NUN
AND HIS SON IN LAW GENJI BY WHOSE INFLUENCE ALL THINGS IN PUBLIC WERE SWAYED IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR THE DAUGHTER OF GON CHIUNAGON FORMERLY TO NO CHIUJIO WAS INTRODUCED AT COURT SHE TOOK UP HER ABODE IN THE KOKIDEN
KOREMITZ ENTERED AND PROCEEDING TO THE DOOR CALLED OUT
YET HIS NOBILITY OF MANNERS WAS EASILY RECOGNIZABLE WELCOME YOUR VISIT CRIED THE HERMIT SALUTING HIM PERHAPS YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SENT FOR ME THE OTHER DAY I HAVE LONG SINCE QUITTED THE AFFAIRS OF THIS WORLD
SOON UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE MEANT AND THIS HE ACCORDINGLY DID ON THE MORROW ON A BEAUTIFUL FLOWER WAITER UP TO THIS TIME NOTHING ABOUT VIOLET HAD BEEN PUBLICLY KNOWN
SO GENJI WHOSE MIND WAS OCCUPIED IN THOUGHT COULD NOT SLUMBER HERE THE PRIEST SAID HE WAS GOING TO VESPERS BUT IN REALITY IT WAS LATER THAN THE PROPER TIME FOR THEM GENJI PERCEIVED
THIS AT LENGTH OBLIGED THE NUN TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PRINCE HE THEN TOLD HER THAT HE CALLED BUDDHA TO WITNESS THAT THOUGH HIS CONDUCT MAY HAVE SEEMED BOLD IT WAS DICTATED BY PURE AND CONSCIENTIOUS MOTIVES
THAN MANY REGULAR PRIESTS HERE GENJI INTERRUPTED WHAT IS HIS DAUGHTER LIKE WITHOUT DOUBT ANSWERED HIS COMPANION THE BEAUTY OF HER PERSON IS UNRIVALLED AND SHE IS ENDOWED WITH CORRESPONDING MENTAL ABILITY
THE LADY WAS SAFELY DELIVERED OF A CHILD NOW TO PERFORM DUE THANKSGIVING FOR THIS HAPPY DELIVERANCE
AND WHO STILL REMAINED WITH THE PRINCESS USED TO GO TO HER
GENJI TRIED TO CONSOLE HER HE TOOK UP A KIN AND ASKED HER TO PLAY AND SING WITH HIM BUT SHE DID NOT TOUCH IT SAYING THAT SHE COULD NOT PLAY IT SO WELL AS THE MAIDEN OF AKASHI
IF I DECLINE YOUR REQUEST YET LET THERE BE NO RESERVE IN THE EXPRESSION OF YOUR IDEAS INTERRUPTED GENJI BUT BEFORE THEY COULD TALK FURTHER THE RETURN OF THE PRIEST PUT AN END TO THE SUBJECT AND GENJI RETIRED TO HIS QUARTERS
THESE WITH THEIR ILLUSTRATIONS WERE HER CHIEF RESOURCES NOW A SISTER OF THE PRINCESS'S MOTHER HAD MARRIED A DURIO AND HAD ALREADY BORNE HIM A DAUGHTER THIS MARRIAGE HAD BEEN CONSIDERED AN UNEQUAL MATCH BY THE FATHER OF THE PRINCESS

WELL HE SAID LET'S HAVE ANOTHER CHAPTER I WAS CONSIDERING WHETHER I SHOULD RISE AND LEAVE THE MEETING ABRUPTLY WHEN HE THREW THE BOOK DOWN HEAVED A LONG SIGH AND SAID

HE BROUGHT IN THE HIDDEN BRANCHES AND THREW THEM ON A FEW TWIGS AT A TIME TO THE SURPRISE OF THE OTHERS IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM THE SPICEWOOD BOUGHS NOT ONLY ADDED TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SCENE BUT FILLED THE WHOLE HOUSE
WHICH WAS TO TAKE EFFECT THE FIRST OF JANUARY FOLLOWING SECRETARY STANTON CONTINUED I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE CALM BUT I THINK I LOST MY CALMNESS FOR A MOMENT AND WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM I AROSE
FOR TAD TO CATCH WHEN THE PAGES CAME TOO SLOWLY THE BOY PULLED HIS FATHER'S COAT TAIL PIPING UP IN A MUFFLED EXCITED TONE GIVE ME NOTHER PAPER PAPA DAY
TAD OPENED HIS EYES WIDE WITH WONDER IS PAPA DAY HAPPY IN HEAVEN HE ASKED EAGERLY YES YES I'M SURE HE'S HAPPY THERE TADDIE DEAR NOW GO TO SLEEP
WHEN HE GOT THE CHANCET THEY ALL LOOKED ON REDSKINS LIKE THEY WAS CATAMOUNTS AN OTHER PESKY VARMINTS YOUR GRANDMOTHER LINCOLN AN JOSIAH AN ME MOVED OVER INTO WASHINGTON COUNTY
MISTER LINCOLN WENT AWAY AFTER YIELDING ENOUGH TO SAY HE MIGHT ACCEPT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS SOMETIME IN A PINCH OF SOME SORT THE OCCASION WAS NOT LONG DELAYED BUT IT WAS NOT BECAUSE OF ILLNESS OR ANY SPECIAL NECESSITY IN HIS OWN FAMILY HIS YOUNG PARTNER BILLY HERNDON
HE DELIVERED AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE WASHINGTONIAN TEMPERANCE SOCIETY IN WHICH HE COMPARED WHITE SLAVERY WITH BLACK IN WHICH HE SAID AND WHEN THE VICTORY SHALL BE COMPLETE
CURRENCY IF YOU'VE GOT IT HANDY GIVE MISTER LINCOLN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FATHER CALLED TO A CLERK IN THE OFFICE THERE WAS A MOMENT'S PAUSE DURING WHICH MY FATHER REFRAINED FROM ASKING ANY QUESTIONS
LOOKING UP AT THE SEWARDS FATHER AND SON HE SMILED AND SAID WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
THEN I HEARS THE MOST BLOOD CURDLIN YELLS AND A LOT O RED DEVILS JUMP OUT O THE BUSHES AN COME FOR ME BRANDISHIN THEIR TOMAHAWKS AN SKELPIN KNIVES IT WAS LIKE HELL BROKE LOOSE THEY HAD BEEN WATCHIN AN OF COURSE TWAS ALL RIGHT TO KILL FATHER
AN ABE WAS RIGHT OUT IN THE WOODS ABOUT AS SOON'S HE WAS WEANED FISHIN IN THE CREEK SETTIN TRAPS FUR RABBITS AN MUSKRATS GOIN ON COON HUNTS WITH TOM AN ME AN THE DOGS
WE DID NOT GET TO SEE EACH OTHER VERY OFTEN ONE SUNDAY MORNING MY MOTHER WAKED ME UP EARLY SAYING SHE WAS GOING TO SEE MISSUS LINCOLN AND THAT I COULD GO ALONG GLAD OF THE CHANCE I WAS SOON DRESSED AND READY TO GO
IF THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT BACK UP SUCH A DECLARATION THE OTHER PARTY DID NOT WISH THE MATTER TAMPERED WITH AS CHEAP LABOR WAS NECESSARY FOR RAISING COTTON SUGAR AND OTHER PRODUCTS ON WHICH THE LIVING OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DEPENDED
AND MISTER LINCOLN WAS IN NO MOOD TO GIVE INFORMATION AS SOON AS THE MONEY WAS BROUGHT THE TALL ATTORNEY SEIZED THE BILLS AND STALKED OUT WITHOUT COUNTING IT OR SAYING ANYTHING BUT THANKEE MISTER MAN AND HURRIED DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE SQUARE TOWARD THE COURT HOUSE
THEY WAS ABOUT READY TO MAKE HIM CHIEF HE PRETENDED ALL THE WHILE AS HOW HE'D LIKE THAT WHEN HE GOT AWAY FROM EM HE WAS SUCH A GOOD FELLOW THAT THEM INJUNS ADMIRED HIS SHREWDNESS AND THEY LET HIM DO ABOUT WHAT HE PLEASED SO HE THOUGHT THEY'D LET FATHER ALONE
WAS THE DARKEST IN THE HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR PRESIDENT LINCOLN WALKED THE FLOOR THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG CRYING OUT IN HIS ANGUISH O WHAT WILL THE COUNTRY SAY
BUT HE SOON WON THE GREAT BATTLES OF FREDERICKSBURG AND CHANCELLORSVILLE AND HAD MADE HIS WAY NORTH INTO PENNSYLVANIA THE NIGHT AFTER THE BATTLE OF CHANCELLORSVILLE
HE CLUNG TO IT AND I PULLED HIM OUT ON THE BANK ALMOST DEAD I GOT HIM BY THE ARMS AND SHOOK HIM WELL AND THEN I ROLLED HIM ON THE GROUND WHEN THE WATER POURED OUT OF HIS MOUTH HE WAS ALL RIGHT VERY SOON
MISTER LINCOLN SEATED HIMSELF AT HIS TABLE TOOK UP THE PEN DIPPED IT IN THE INK HELD THE PEN A MOMENT THEN LAID IT DOWN AFTER WAITING A WHILE HE WENT THROUGH THE SAME MOVEMENTS AS BEFORE
APPROACHED THE PRESIDENT EXTENDED MY HAND AND SAID MISTER PRESIDENT IF THE READING OF CHAPTERS OF ARTEMUS WARD IS A PRELUDE TO SUCH A DEED AS THIS THE BOOK SHOULD BE FILED AMONG THE ARCHIVES OF THE NATION
CLUTCHING THE PRECIOUS BANKNOTES IN HIS BONY TALONS FATHER SAW HIM CROSS THE STREET SO FAST THAT THE TAILS OF HIS LONG COAT STOOD OUT STRAIGHT BEHIND THEN GO UP THE COURT HOUSE STEPS TWO AT A TIME AND DISAPPEAR WE LEARNED AFTERWARD WHAT HE DID WITH THE MONEY
IT IS DUE TO MY CABINET THAT YOU SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO HEAR AND KNOW OF IT AND IF ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE AS TO THE FORM OF THIS PAPER OR ITS COMPOSITION I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR THEM
WILLIAM H SEWARD SECRETARY OF STATE WITH HIS SON FREDERICK CALLED AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE EMANCIPATION DOCUMENT TO BE SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT IT WAS JUST AFTER THE REGULAR NEW YEAR'S DAY RECEPTION
WHO LOVED EVERY ONE SO HE WANDERED THROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS ACHING WITH LONELINESS MURMURING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF PAPA DAY WHERE'S MY PAPA DAY I'M TIRED
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN HOW EMANCIPATION CAME TO PASS WHEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A SMALL BOY HE BEGAN TO SHOW THE KEENEST SYMPATHY FOR THE HELPLESS AND OPPRESSED THE ONLY TIME HE BETRAYED ANGER AS A CHILD
IT IS AS WHEN ONE IS CONSIDERING SHAKSPEARE KING LEAR MACBETH OTHELLO SURELY A SUFFICIENT ACHIEVEMENT BUT THE MASTERPIECE REMAINS COMPARISONS IN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS ARE BUT LITTLE HELP PERHAPS
THE MOON PULLING AT THE TIDAL PROTUBERANCE AND HOLDING IT STILL AS THE EARTH ROTATES IS THE MECHANISM WHEREBY THE ENERGY IS EXTRACTED THE HANDLE WHEREBY THE FRICTION BRAKE IS APPLIED
FOR A CONSIDERABLE COLLECTION OF DATA TO HAVE ACCUMULATED WITH RESPECT TO IT HE TRIED ALL MANNER OF CIRCULAR ORBITS FOR THE EARTH AND FOR MARS PLACING THEM IN ALL SORTS OF ASPECTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SUN
THE SQUARE OF THE TIME OF REVOLUTION OR YEAR OF EACH PLANET IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE CUBE OF ITS MEAN DISTANCE FROM THE SUN THE BOOK IN WHICH THIS LAW WAS PUBLISHED ON CELESTIAL HARMONIES
I MUST READ YOU A LETTER WRITTEN TO HIM BY KEPLER IT SEEMS THAT KEPLER ON ONE OF HIS ABSENCES FROM PRAGUE DRIVEN HALF MAD WITH POVERTY AND TROUBLE FELL FOUL OF TYCHO
THE MONTH WAS ONLY THREE HOURS LONG AT THIS INITIAL EPOCH REMEMBER HOWEVER THE INITIAL LENGTH OF THE DAY WE FOUND THAT IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE FOR THE EARTH TO ROTATE ON ITS AXIS IN THREE HOURS AND THAT WHEN IT DID SO
AND HE PROCEEDED TO STUDY OPTICS HE GAVE A VERY ACCURATE EXPLANATION OF THE ACTION OF THE HUMAN EYE AND MADE MANY HYPOTHESES SOME OF THEM SHREWD AND CLOSE TO THE MARK CONCERNING THE LAW OF REFRACTION OF LIGHT IN DENSE MEDIA
IF YOU INSCRIBE IN A CIRCLE A LARGE NUMBER OF EQUILATERAL TRIANGLES THEY ENVELOP ANOTHER CIRCLE
THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION SEEMED TO BE IN THE AIR AND WREN HOOKE AND HALLEY HAD MANY A TALK ABOUT IT HOOKE SHOWED AN EXPERIMENT WITH A PENDULUM WHICH HE LIKENED TO A PLANET GOING ROUND THE SUN
IT WAS LIKE HAVING TO DETERMINE A CURVE FROM THREE POINTS CLOSE TOGETHER
YOU HAVE DONE ME EVERY POSSIBLE KINDNESS YOU HAVE COMMUNICATED TO ME EVERYTHING YOU HOLD MOST DEAR NO ONE BY WORD OR DEED HAS INTENTIONALLY INJURED ME IN ANYTHING IN SHORT NOT TO YOUR CHILDREN
PLANETS MOVE IN ELLIPSES WITH THE SUN IN ONE FOCUS LAW TWO THE RADIUS VECTOR OR LINE JOINING SUN AND PLANET SWEEPS OUT EQUAL AREAS IN EQUAL TIMES
IT IS LONGER THAN OUR LIFETIME IT IS TRUE TO THE EPHEMERAL INSECTS WHOSE LIFETIME IS AN HOUR A YEAR MIGHT SEEM AN AWFUL PERIOD THE MID DAY SUN MIGHT SEEM AN ALMOST STATIONARY BODY THE CHANGES OF THE SEASONS WOULD BE UNKNOWN
AND ONLY A FEW FEET HIGH THIS IS THE ERA WE CALL TO DAY THE PROCESS DOES NOT STOP HERE STILL THE STATELY MARCH OF EVENTS GOES ON AND THE EYE OF SCIENCE STRIVES TO PENETRATE INTO THE EVENTS OF THE FUTURE WITH THE SAME CLEARNESS
STILL HOWEVER HIS METHOD OF FLUXIONS WAS UNKNOWN AND STILL HE DID NOT PUBLISH IT HE LECTURED FIRST ON OPTICS GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIMENTS HIS LECTURES WERE AFTERWARDS PUBLISHED BOTH IN LATIN AND ENGLISH AND ARE HIGHLY VALUED TO THIS DAY
TIDES AT ONCE BEGIN GIGANTIC TIDES OF MOLTEN LAVA HUNDREDS OF MILES HIGH TIDES NOT IN FREE OCEAN FOR THERE WAS NONE THEN BUT IN THE PASTY MASS OF THE ENTIRE EARTH IMMEDIATELY THE SERIES OF CHANGES I HAVE DESCRIBED BEGINS
AND THE ONLY SOLUTION OFFERED BY GEOLOGISTS WAS UNLIMITED TIME GIVEN UNLIMITED TIME THEY COULD OF COURSE BE FORMED NO MATTER HOW SLOWLY THE PROCESS WENT ON
WHICH I OUGHT NOT TO DIMINISH NOW TIS YOURS
AND WEIGHS THEREFORE IF COMPOSED OF ROCK
THIS IS A CRITICAL SPEED IF EVER THE DAY WAS THREE HOURS LONG SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED THE DAY CAN NEVER HAVE BEEN SHORTER THAN THAT FOR IF IT WERE THE EARTH WOULD HAVE A TENDENCY TO FLY IN PIECES
NOW JUST NOTE WHAT THE EFFECT OF THE INCREASED NEARNESS OF THE MOON WAS UPON OUR TIDES REMEMBER THAT THE TIDE GENERATING FORCE VARIES INVERSELY AS THE CUBE OF DISTANCE
THE WAY HE ACCOUNTED FOR PRECESSION AND NUTATION AND FOR THE TIDES THE WAY IN WHICH LAPLACE EXPLAINED EVERY DETAIL OF THE PLANETARY MOTIONS THESE ACHIEVEMENTS MAY SEEM TO THE PROFESSIONAL ASTRONOMER EQUALLY IF NOT MORE STRIKING AND WONDERFUL
AND COMPARISON OF HYPOTHESES WITH FACT BREWSTER SAYS OF HIM ARDENT RESTLESS BURNING TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF BY DISCOVERY HE ATTEMPTED EVERYTHING
WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OF MILLIONS OF YEARS SOMEWHAT FAMILIARLY
CATALOGUING ALL THE STARS WHICH HE OBSERVED INTENDING AFTERWARDS TO SORT OUT HIS OBSERVATIONS COMPARE ONE WITH ANOTHER AND FIND OUT WHETHER ANY ONE STAR HAD CHANGED ITS POSITION BECAUSE IF IT HAD IT MUST BE THE PLANET
BOTH BEING SUPPOSED EXCENTRIC WITH RESPECT TO THE SUN BUT HE COULD NOT GET ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENT TO WORK WITH UNIFORM MOTION ABOUT THE SUN SO HE REINTRODUCED THE EQUANT
AND OUR NUMEROUS METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATORIES WITH THEIR CONTINUAL RECORD OF EVENTS
IN EVOLVING THE BEGINNINGS OF LAW AND ORDER FROM THE MIDST OF ALL THIS CHAOS PERHAPS AS A MAN HE MAY NOT COME BUT HIS ERA WILL COME THROUGH THIS STAGE THE SCIENCE MUST PASS
BUT THOUGH DESIRABLE AND ESSENTIAL FOR THE WORK IT WAS A SEVERE TAX UPON THE POWERS OF THE MAN THERE IS IN FACT NO DOUBT THAT NEWTON'S BRAIN SUFFERED TEMPORARY ABERRATION AFTER THIS EFFORT FOR A SHORT TIME THE ATTACK WAS SLIGHT AND IT HAS BEEN DENIED
AND SEE IF BY ANY POSSIBILITY THE PLANET COULD HAVE BEEN IN THAT PLACE AT THAT TIME EXAMINED IN THIS WAY THE TABULATED OBSERVATIONS OF FLAMSTEED SHOWED THAT HE HAD UNWITTINGLY OBSERVED URANUS FIVE DISTINCT TIMES THE FIRST TIME IN SIXTEEN NINETY
MIGHT IN THE COURSE OF AGES IF LEFT TO THEMSELVES MUTUALLY PERTURB EACH OTHER INTO A DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENT OF ORBITS FROM THAT WITH WHICH THEY BEGAN BUT THEIR PERTURBATIONS WOULD BE VERY MINUTE AND MOREOVER ON LAPLACE'S THEORY WOULD ONLY RESULT IN PERIODIC CHANGES
IN SIXTEEN O ONE KEPLER WAS APPOINTED IMPERIAL MATHEMATICIAN TO ASSIST TYCHO IN HIS CALCULATIONS THE EMPEROR RUDOLPH DID A GOOD PIECE OF WORK IN THUS MAINTAINING THESE TWO EMINENT MEN BUT IT IS QUITE CLEAR
BUT UNLESS SOME UNFORESEEN CATASTROPHE INTERVENES IT MUST ASSUREDLY COME YET NEITHER WILL EVEN THIS BE THE FINAL STAGE FOR THE SYSTEM IS DISTURBED BY THE TIDE GENERATING FORCE OF THE SUN IT IS A SMALL EFFECT
OF ITS DISTANCE FROM THE SUN OR ONCE MORE THE SPEED OF EACH PLANET IN ITS ORBIT IS AS THE INVERSE SQUARE ROOT OF ITS DISTANCE FROM THE SUN THE PRODUCT OF THE DISTANCE INTO THE SQUARE OF THE SPEED
AND ULTIMATELY CONVERTS THE MORE REASONABLE OF HIS OPPONENTS BUT HE RELIEVES HIS MIND IN THE FOLLOWING LETTER TO THE SECRETARY OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY
AND SO THEY MIGHT HAVE GONE ON FOR A LONG TIME BUT THEY ARE UNSTABLE AND CANNOT GO ON THUS THEY MUST EITHER SEPARATE OR COLLAPSE SOME DISTURBING CAUSE ACTS AGAIN AND THE SMALLER MASS BEGINS TO REVOLVE LESS RAPIDLY
EARTH ONE THOUSAND MARS THREE HUNDRED FOUR JUPITER TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX SATURN ONE THOUSAND AND THIRTY THREE URANUS TWENTY ONE NEPTUNE NINE
WE HAVE THUS ARRIVED AT THIS FACT
TO UNDERTAKE ANOTHER BOOK STILL HE WORKED ON AT THE RUDOLPHINE TABLES OF TYCHO AND ULTIMATELY WITH SOME SMALL HELP FROM VIENNA COMPLETED THEM BUT HE COULD NOT GET THE MEANS TO PRINT THEM
AT THE AGE OF NEARLY EIGHTY THIS NARRATION RENDERS THE UNFLAGGING ENERGY SHOWN BY HER SON IN HIS MATHEMATICAL WRESTLINGS LESS SURPRISING INTERSPERSED WITH THESE DOMESTIC TROUBLES
BUT THERE ARE LETTERS EXTANT WHICH ARE INEXPLICABLE OTHERWISE AND MOREOVER AFTER A YEAR OR TWO HE WRITES TO HIS FRIENDS APOLOGIZING FOR STRANGE AND DISJOINTED EPISTLES
SO STRIKING A COINCIDENCE SEEMED SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY A HERSCHELIAN SWEEP FOR A WEEK OR TWO BUT A SWEEP FOR SO DISTANT A PLANET WOULD BE NO EASY MATTER
NEVER DOES IT BEGIN TO ACT OPPOSITELY AND UNDO WHAT IT HAS DONE IT IS LIKE THE PERPETUAL DROPPING OF WATER THERE MAY BE ONLY ONE DROP IN A TWELVEMONTH BUT LEAVE IT LONG ENOUGH AND THE HARDEST STONE MUST BE WORN AWAY AT LAST
INSTEAD OF ACTING THROUGH THE MISCHIEVOUS MEDIUM OF THIRD PARTIES IN THE NEXT EDITION NEWTON LIBERALLY RECOGNIZES THE CLAIMS OF BOTH HOOKE AND WREN HOWEVER HE TAKES WARNING BETIMES OF WHAT HE HAS TO EXPECT AND WRITES TO HALLEY THAT HE WILL ONLY PUBLISH THE FIRST TWO BOOKS
WRITE DOWN THE SERIES ZERO THREE SIX TWELVE TWENTY FOUR
EVEN WHILE ROBIN WONDERED WHETHER WILL OR HIS MEN MIGHT AGAIN DEMAND TOLL OF HIM MASTER WILL HIMSELF SUDDENLY APPEARED AND WITHOUT A WORD PLACED HIS BOW ACROSS THEIR PATH
YET SECRETLY HE WAS FLATTERED BY THIS SINCERE BELIEF IN HIM I'LL GO WITH YOU TO NOTTINGHAM AND STUTELEY SHALL STAY HERE ON GUARD SAID ROBIN BUT STUTELEY BEGGED MOST EARNESTLY THAT HE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO ALSO SO THAT ROBIN CAME NIGH TO GIVING UP THE PLAN ALL TOGETHER
HE TURNED TO HIS MEN NOW COMRADES CRIED HE HAVE YOU SEARCHED OUR PRISONERS AND PREPARED THEM TIS WELL ARE THEY BOUND TOGETHER THEN BY THE ARMS TWOS AND THREES AS IS APPOINTED IN OUR RULES AND IS THE RIGHT LEG AND LEFT LEG OF EACH VILLAIN SHACKLED TOGETHER
I PROMISE YOU TWENTY CROWNS TO TWENTY CROWNS
THIS IS A NOTIFICATION FROM THE PRINCE TO THE ABBOT OF YORK SAYING THAT HIS EMISSARIES HAVE SOUNDED YOU AND THAT YOU ARE READY WITH YOUR MEN TO STRIKE FOR HIM I HAVE SAID SO MUCH COMMENTED WILL NAMING THREE CONDITIONS THEY ARE WRITTEN HEREIN FIRST
AND I WOULD HAVE YOU ENTER THERE IN THE LISTS AND BEAR AWAY THE PRINCE'S BAG OF GOLD EVEN AS YOU DID THE SHERIFF'S ARROW TELL ME OF THIS WARRENTON CRIED ROBIN INTERESTED AT ONCE WHERE DID YOU LEARN THIS ITEM
FROM OUT OF WELL FILLED BAGS ALL THE TREASURE THAT THEY HAD ACCUMULATED IN THEIR CAVES AT BARNESDALE THE KING'S BOWMEN FREELY DISTRIBUTED THIS DAY ALL WERE HAPPY
BUT RATHER AMUSED AS IT WERE SURELY SURELY YOU WILL GO BACK WITH ME TO MORROW AND DEMAND THE PURSE FROM THE SHERIFF SAID WARRENTON IN ARGUMENTATIVE ATTITUDE
AND MASTER BLAND'S ARROW CAME TUMBLING TO THE GROUND LEAVING THE BEGGAR'S SHAFT SHAKING IN THE VERY HOLE ITS OPPONENT'S ARROW HAD MADE THIS WONDROUS FEAT OF ARCHERY EVOKED THE LOUDEST APPLAUSE AND HAD NOT THE SHERIFF BEEN SO FOOLISH A MAN MUST HAVE AWAKENED SUSPICION IN HIS BREAST
MONCEUX KNOWING THAT MONTFICHET WOULD REQUIRE AN EXPLANATION OF THE REFUSAL TO INSTAL ROBIN IN HIS FATHER'S PLACE HAD SET HIMSELF OUT TO BE BEFOREHAND WITH THE SQUIRE
THE THING IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THE CLERK HIMSELF HAS BEEN SUSPECTED OF COLLEAGUING WITH THESE ROBBERS OF THE FOREST FRIEND GAMEWELL WHISPERED THE SHERIFF LEANING FORWARD TOWARDS THE SQUIRE AND THEY DO SAY THAT WILL WAS AT OUR TOURNEY
THE SHERIFF AND SIMEON CARFAX WOULD ATTEND TO THAT NO DOUBT A CURIOUS DEJECTION SETTLED UPON ROBIN HE HAD NOTHING BUT GLOOMY THOUGHTS UPON HIM AS HE TRUDGED TOWARDS THE SQUIRE'S DOMAIN NOR DID HIS SPIRITS RISE AT HIS RECEPTION BY OLD GAMEWELL
AY BUT THE ARCHERY I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THE PRINCE OFFERS A FINE PRIZE KNOW ALSO THAT HE BRINGS WITH HIM HUBERT THE MOST RENOWNED OF ALL ARCHERS SO THAT HE DEEMS THE PRIZE ALREADY WON THE PRINCE PUTS A HUNDRED GOLD PIECES INTO THE PURSE AND HUBERT
AND CARFAX KEPT HIMSELF AS FAR OUT OF IT AS POSSIBLE PRESENTLY THREE OF THE FORESTERS OVERPOWERED THE GOOD NATURED STILL HALF TIPSY MILLER AND HELD HIM DOWN THEN MASTER CARFAX SPRANG FROM HIS HORSE AND RUSHED IN UPON THE PROSTRATE MILLER
BE SILENT KNAVE SNAPPED THE LEAN FACED MAN SHARPLY WHO GAVE YOU THE RIGHT TO QUESTION ME SHUT YOUR MOUTH OR I WILL HAVE YOU ACCOUNTED AS ACCOMPLICE WITH THESE FELLOWS AND PUT A NOOSE ABOUT YOUR BULL NECK ALSO WHY HARKEE MASTER SAID MUCH VERY WRATHFUL
IT WAS A FETE DAY AND FOLK CROWDED INTO NOTTINGHAM BY ALL GATES THESE HAD BEEN LOWERED HOSPITABLY AND WERE TO REMAIN DOWN ALL DAY THE STAGES HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR QUARTER STAFF THERE WAS A FELLOW ONE NAT OF NOTTINGHAM WHO WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE FINEST PLAYER AT THE GAME FOR MANY MILES AROUND
FOR I SHOULD ALWAYS FEEL SHAME WERE WE TO BE AS HARSH WITH AN ENEMY AS HE WOULD BE WITH US IT WOULD SHOW US NO BETTER THEN HE TAKE HIM THEN SINCE LOCKSLEY WILL HAVE IT SO AND TIE HIS LEGS UNDER THE BELLY OF HIS HORSE
THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT AND AFTER THEM THE JOVIAL FRIAR OF COPMANHURST ARTHUR A BLAND WITH A GOLD CHAIN ABOUT HIS NECK GIVEN HIM BY THE KNIGHT SIR RICHARD WALKED WITH MIDDLE THE TINKER
BY TELLING HIM THE STORY OF THE PEACOCKED ARROW
HE TUMBLED OFF HIS HORSE AND THE OTHER THREE OF THEM DID THE LIKE AND THEN STRODE OVER TO WHERE ROBIN STOOD RELEASE HIM SAID THE MILLER DETERMINEDLY AND HE PROMPTLY KNOCKED TWO OF THE FORESTERS SPRAWLING THIS WAS THE SIGNAL FOR A GENERAL ENCOUNTER
YOU KNOW YOUR CHAMBER SLEEP WELL AND WE WILL TALK TOGETHER IN THE MORNING THE MORNING SAW NO EASEMENT OF THE SQUIRE'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS ROBIN AND AS SOON AS BREAKFAST WAS ENDED HE DETERMINED TO GO WITHOUT WASTING BREATH UPON THE ERRAND WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM FOR SURE
FIERCELY FACING THE BISHOP SHE HAD ELBOWED A PATH FOR HERSELF TO THE CHANCEL STEPS I DO FORBID THE MARRYING OF THESE TWO SHE POINTED A TREMBLING FINGER FROM ROBIN TO MARIAN
ROBIN SMILED AT THE OLD MAN'S EMPHATIC SPEECH WHEN IS THIS PRIZE TO BE OFFERED WARRENTON AND WHAT OTHER MARVELS ARE THERE TO BE THE MAN AT ARMS COMMENCED AFRESH THERE IS TO BE A TOURNEY
AND STAY NOT UNTIL YOU REACH LOCKSLEY WE MAY MEET AGAIN TO TALK OF THANKS SHE ADDED SEEING THAT HE STILL HESITATED GIVE ME AT LEAST YOUR NAME PANTED POOR ROBIN AT THE DOOR NOT THAT I SHALL EVER FORGET YOU I AM CALLED MARIAN
SO BRAVELY AS HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM ROBIN SPOKE TO THE OLD MAN SIR HE SAID I HAVE IT IN ME TO SPEAK PLAIN WORDS WITH YOU AND I MAY HAVE NO FEAR BOY I AM ONE WHO LOVES AN OPEN MIND MONTFICHET SPOKE WITH MEANING WELL SIR
CHAPTER TWELVE SO INGLORIOUSLY THEY RETURNED THROUGH THE NIGHT TO LOCKSLEY NONE OFFERED TO STAY THEM IN THE FOREST OF SHERWOOD INDEED
THE SHERIFF NARROWLY WATCHED EACH COMPETITOR AND GLANCED OFTEN TOWARDS MISTRESS MONCEUX THE DEMOISELLE MARIE HAD ONE OF HER WOMEN SITTING NEAR HER FEET SO THAT EVERY MOVEMENT SHE MADE MIGHT BE OBSERVED THE SHERIFF'S DAUGHTER SIGNALLED NO AND NO AGAIN TO HER FATHER AS THE VARIOUS BOWMEN
AND LITTLE JOHN SHE ALLOWED THEM TO THRUST HER IGNOMINIOUSLY FORTH AT THE DOOR OF THE CHURCH SHE TURNED ONCE AS THOUGH TO RENEW HER PREPOSTEROUS CHARGES BUT CONTENTED HERSELF MERELY
AND I DO COUNSEL YOU TO DEAL LAWFULLY IN IT MASTER FORD REMEMBER THAT HE ALSO IS SUSPECTED OF BEING AN OUTLAW IN THAT YOU SAW HIM ONCE USE A PEACOCKED ARROW ALTHOUGH I AM BUT A LAYMAN AS IT WERE FRIEND HE ADDED MEANINGLY YET I DO KNOW THE LAW
THE SOLDIERS HALTED AND PREPARED THEIR CROSSBOWS A VOLLEY OF THEIR ARROWS CRASHED AND SPLINTERED THE TREES WHILST CARFAX ROSE UP STIFFLY TO GIVE FRESH ORDERS A DUELLO COMMENCED OF LONGBOW AGAINST CROSSBOW AND AS THE FREEBOOTERS COULD DELIVER NEAR
UNFORESEEN EVENTS HOWEVER UPSET THESE SCHEMES AND HASTENED MATTERS EVEN WHILE ROBIN WAS PERFECTING HIMSELF IN THE USE OF THE LONGBOW UNDER WARRENTON AND IN THE ART OF WRESTLING WITH LITTLE LITHE STUTELEY THE LEAN FACED MAN WHOM HE SAW AT THE TOURNEY
BLUNDERED INTO THE LISTS THROUGH THE GATE ROBIN WAS GLAD INDEED OF HIS STAINED FACE AND SEMI DISGUISE NOT BEING OVER PROUD OF HIS COMPANIONS HE GAVE WILL STUTELEY A SIGNAL TO DETACH HIMSELF FROM THEM AND COME TO HIS SIDE THE TWO YOUTHS THEN HASTENED TO THE ARCHERS STAND
HE WORE A BEARD POINTED AND UNTRIMMED AND HE LISTENED VERY CALMLY TO THE OTHER'S NOISY CHATTERING COME UP HERE YOU DIRTY VILLAIN AND I'LL DUST YOUR RAGS FOR YOU CRIED NAT FLOURISHING HIS STAFF IF YOU WILL USE A SHORTER STAFF THAN THIS MASTER WIND BAG
HALF IN DEFENSE FOR GAMEWELL LOOKED SO FIERCELY AT HIM NOR DO I SEEK TO KEEP YOU TO YOUR OFFER ADDED HE IN HIS THOUGHTS I WAS NOT THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU BOY REPLIED THE SQUIRE AND AGAIN A BETTER EXPRESSION SHONE BRIEFLY IN HIS FACE GIVE YOU GOOD NIGHT ROBIN LOCKSLEY
ROBIN STAINED HIS FACE AND BADE STUTELEY DO THE SAME ERE STARTING TO THE ROYAL TOURNEY THE MORNING WAS OVERCAST AND DOUBTFUL WHEN THE TWO LADS SET FORTH
FULL RANK AS BARON OF THE REALM WITH POWER TO SPEAK AND VOTE IN THE UPPER COURT OF APPEAL THE HIGHEST RANK IN THE LAND NEXT TO THE KING HIMSELF SIR RICHARD OF THE LEE AND HIS SON
IN ORDER THAT THE QUESTION OF HIS APPOINTMENT TO A POST IN THE KING'S FORESTERS MIGHT BE WEIGHED AND CONSIDERED AS FOR THE RANGERSHIP OF LOCKSLEY THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN GIVEN TO ONE MASTER JOHN FORD
SO WERE THE CLOUDS UPON ROBIN'S HORIZON GATHERING APACE HE GRAVELY CONTINUED IN HIS DUTIES AT LOCKSLEY FILLING UP HIS LEISURE WITH LONG AND FREQUENT PRACTICE IN ARCHERY WITH WARRENTON
GEOFFREY IS OUTLAWED MOTHER MINE AND MAY NOT APPEAR IN SHERWOOD ANSWERED ROBIN TEMPORIZING WITH HER AND THE STORY OF OUR MEETING IS TOO LONG A ONE FOR THE MOMENT WE ARE RARELY FATIGUED AND I WOULD GLADLY GET ME TO BED COME WILL ROUSE YOURSELF
THEREFORE WHEN THE BEGGAR WENT TO FETCH HIS PRIZE FROM THE SHERIFF'S OWN HANDS THERE WAS GREAT CHEERING AND APPLAUSE HE FOUND MONCEUX SEATED IN A HANDSOME BOOTH WITH HIS DAUGHTER AND HER MAIDS NEAR BY THE ARCHERY RINGS HERE THE SHOOTING WAS IN PROGRESS
THE SHERIFF HAD STARED WITH PROTRUDING EYES OF HORROR AND DISMAY UPON HIS DAUGHTER WHEN HE SAW THAT SHE WAS GONE THAT THE DREADFUL EPISODE WAS DONE
ON HIS LEFT AND MUCH THE MILLER ON HIS RIGHT CLOSE BEHIND TROTTED THE SMALL COMPLAISANT MIDGE DRESSED UP VERY FINE IN A LIVERY OF PURPLE DOUBLET AND GREEN HOSE
MY WORD IS ENOUGH FOR YOU RICHARD OF THE LEE ROARED HE FURIOUSLY AM I NOT SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM YOU CANNOT BE THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM GOOD MAN ANSWERED THE KNIGHT GETTING READY TO CLOSE THE WICKET FOR HE IS MASTER
TAKE BACK YOUR MEN AND YOURSELF BE CONTENT WITH THE CAPTAINCY OF THE FORESTERS OF SHERWOOD THIS PART OF THE FOREST WILL BE ADMINISTERED UNDER THE KING'S PLEASURE BY ME WHAT IF I COULD SHOW YOU THE KING'S DISMISSAL OF YOUR FATHER SNARLED THE OTHER
WAS BOUND TO WIN THE ARCHERY CONTEST BEING ADMITTEDLY THE FIRST BOWMAN IN THE WORLD HARKEE GIPSY CALLED HE AT LENGTH OVER THE POINT OF HIS SHOULDER TO PATIENT ROBIN BEHIND HIM I'LL NOT TAKE YOUR CROWN I SWEAR IT
FOLLOW FOLLOW SHE CRIED WITH FLASHING EYES THERE IS NOT A MOMENT TO BE LOST ROBIN SAW THAT IT WAS A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH NOW IN ANY CASE TO THE WEST GATE HE CALLED LOCKSLEY A LOCKSLEY IT WAS THE OLD BATTLE CRY AND ONLY A FEW OF THEM REMEMBERED IT
HOW HE HAD TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS AN ANGEL TOO GOOD AND PURE TO BE SUPPOSED CAPABLE OF EVIL HOW HE HAD SAID THAT IN HIS CASTLES IN THE AIR HE WOULD STILL THINK OF HER AS HIS WIFE
THAT JOURNEY WHICH WAS TO BE MADE FOR SO IMPORTANT AN OBJECT THEN LORD GEORGE DID JUST WHAT HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DONE HE WROTE AN ANGRY LETTER TO MISS FLEABODY AS HE CALLED HER COMPLAINING BITTERLY
AND THERE'S NO MORE FUN TO BE MADE OF THE BARONESS I'M NOT SURE BUT THAT SHE HAS THE BEST OF THE FUN I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN IN THE WORLD COULD GET A FIVE POUND NOTE OUT OF ME BUT SHE HAD HOW COULD YOU BE SO FOOLISH HOW INDEED
MISSUS JONES REMEMBERS THE KAPPA KAPPA AND SAYS LITTLE OR NOTHING ON THE SUBJECT BUT SHE HEARTILY DISSENTS FROM HER FRIEND AND STILL HOPES THAT THERE MAY BE A GOOD TIME COMING
SHE WAS HOWEVER OF OPINION THAT IF MARY WAS CONCEALED IN A CERTAIN ROOM AT MANOR CROSS WHICH MIGHT SHE THOUGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY WARMED AND VENTILATED FOR HEALTH
EVERYONE AT RUDHAM WAS ANXIOUS TO SIT BY HIS SIDE AND TO BE ALLOWED TO TALK TO HIM WHEN HE ABUSED THE DEAN WHICH HE DID FREELY THOSE WHO HEARD HIM ASSENTED TO ALL HE SAID
IF HE COULD BRING HIMSELF TO ACCEPT THIS AS HIS FATE HE WOULD BE SAVED A DEAL OF TROUBLE SPOONING AT KILLANCODLEM AFTER ALL WOULD NOT BE BAD FUN HE ALMOST TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD MARRY MISS GREEN
I CAN'T AFFORD IT MY DEAR BUT IS THERE NO SUCH THING AS LOVE THAT YOU CAN'T HELP CAN YOU DROP A GIRL OUT OF YOUR HEART ALTOGETHER SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE HAS GOT NO MONEY I SUPPOSE YOU DID LOVE ME ONCE HERE JACK SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
BUT AS HE WENT TO THE STATION HE REFLECTED THAT OLIVIA GREEN WAS A VERY NICE GIRL IF THOSE TEN THOUSAND POUNDS WERE TRUE THEY WOULD BE A GREAT COMFORT TO HIM HIS MOTHER WAS ALWAYS BOTHERING HIM TO GET MARRIED
JACK WAS OF COURSE QUITE WILLING TO SIT UNDER THE CEDAR TREE INSTEAD OF PLAYING CROQUET HE WAS PREPARED TO DO WHATEVER SHE WISHED IF HE COULD ONLY KNOW WHAT SUBJECTS SHE WOULD PREFER HE WOULD TALK ABOUT THEM AND NOTHING ELSE
OR THAT GUSS WAS ENABLED TO FOUND ARGUMENTS ON JACK'S WEALTH WHICH JACK WAS UNABLE TO OPPOSE OR THAT A SENSE OF WHAT WAS DUE TO THE LADY PREVAILED WITH HIM AT LAST HE DID MARRY HER ABOUT A TWELVEMONTH AFTER THE READING OF THE WILL
AND WALKED INTO DINNER LIKE A CHRISTIAN THEY SAY THAT HE IS ALL ALONE IN ITALY AND THAT HE WON'T SEE HER I FANCY HE WAS MORE HURT IN THAT LITTLE AFFAIR THAN SOME PEOPLE WILL ALLOW WHATEVER IT WAS IT SERVED HIM RIGHT
SHE GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT MADE NO DIFFERENCE THEN I WAS OBLIGED TO TELL HER THAT I HADN'T A
MISSUS TOFF CURTSEYED TO HER MOST RESPECTFULLY
WHAT WOULD YOU OWE ME HALF OF IT AND HOW WOULD YOU PAY ME HE THOUGHT A WHILE BEFORE HE MADE HIS ANSWER
AND AS FOR THE AMERICAN FEMALE YOU'LL PUT HER PIPE OUT SUGGESTED MISTER PHILOGUNAC COELEBS WHO WAS NOT SUPERIOR TO A MILD JOKE STOP HER FROM PIPING ALTOGETHER IN DIS CONTRY SAID THE BARONESS
LADY ALICE FELT THIS TO BE A DISTINCT THREAT TO HERSELF BUT SHE ALLOWED IT TO PASS BY WITHOUT NOTICE SHE WAS QUITE SURE THAT THE CANON WOULD NOT QUARREL WITH THE DEAN OUT OF DEFERENCE TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW
EXCEPT WHEN ON GRAND OCCASIONS SHE HAS WALKED THROUGH A QUADRILLE WITH SOME SELECTED PARTNER OF SPECIAL RANK AND THIS SHE DOES SIMPLY AS A DUTY NEVERTHELESS IN SOCIETY SHE IS VERY GAY AND VERY JOYOUS
JUST AS THE OTHER IS COMING MIND THAT YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES I DARESAY ALL THE GERMAIN LADIES ARE LOOKING AFTER YOU DAY AND NIGHT
EVERYTHING IS DULL AFTER A CERTAIN TIME OF LIFE UNLESS A MAN HAS MADE SOME FIXED LINE FOR HIMSELF
THEY TOLD HIM ALMOST TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS AFRAID TO SPEAK OF LOVE TO LADY GEORGE INDEED HE WAS AFRAID AND WITHIN HIS OWN BREAST HE WAS IN SOME SORT PROUD OF HIS FEAR BUT NEVERTHELESS HE WAS TOUCHED BY THEIR RIDICULE
WHICH CAN NEVER NEVER COME ABOUT WHY DID YOU PROMISE IF YOU DO NOT LOVE HER CANNOT YOU UNDERSTAND WITHOUT MY TELLING YOU I CANNOT TELL YOU THAT
THE JUDGES OF THE QUEEN'S BENCH WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND HER THE BABY IN THAT CASE WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN AT MANOR CROSS
IF HE THINKS HIS BREAD IS BUTTERED ON THAT SIDE LET HIM STICK TO THAT SIDE AND SAY SO I WILL REGARD NONE OF MY FAMILY AS ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH ME WHO ASSOCIATE WITH THE DEAN OF BROTHERTON OR HIS DAUGHTER AFTER WHAT TOOK PLACE UP IN LONDON
I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO BE HONEST BUT SOMETIMES IT IS SO DIFFICULT ONE WANTS SOMETIMES TO TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH BUT IT WON'T COME OUT I AM ENGAGED TO HER NOW
THAT BARONESS PROBABLY THINKS THAT SHE WILL GET MONEY OUT OF YOU IF THE WORST COMES TO THE WORST YOU MUST SEND A MEDICAL CERTIFICATE WILL THAT DO OF COURSE IT WILL WHEN GEORGE IS HERE WE WILL GET DOCTOR LOFTLY
BECAUSE HE SAYS MISTER GROSCHUT CAN'T SEE HIM
WHY DID YOU LET HIM TAKE THAT LITTLE HE DID NOT FILL UP THE BLANK BUT MISSUS HOUGHTON QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS TO SUPPOSE EVERYTHING THAT WAS BAD I NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE IT WASN'T FOR ME TO TELL YOU WHAT AN ASS YOU WERE PERHAPS SO
IF I HAD A WIFE OF MY OWN I SHOULD BE SURE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S LADY GEORGE FOR INSTANCE NO NOT LADY GEORGE IT WOULD NOT BE WITH SOMEBODY WHOM I HAD LEARNED TO THINK THE VERY BEST WOMAN IN ALL THE WORLD
YOU AND I GUSS HAVE MADE A MISTAKE FROM THE BEGINNING BEING POOR PEOPLE WE HAVE LIVED AS THOUGH WE WERE RICH I HAVE NEVER DONE SO OH YES YOU HAVE INSTEAD OF DINING OUT IN FITZROY SQUARE AND DRINKING TEA IN TAVISTOCK PLACE
AS MARY WAS ESCAPING FROM THE ROOM SHE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO MAKE CLOAKS AND SKIRTS BUT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO FIGHT AGAINST A WORSE SERVITUDE EVEN THAN THAT
AND LADY SELINA PROTEST
SHE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL SAID JACK WHY THE DEVIL SHE SHOULD HAVE MARRIED GEORGE I CAN'T THINK SHE DOESN'T CARE FOR HIM THE LEAST DON'T YOU THINK SHE DOES I'M SURE SHE DON'T
AND FOR HIS SAKE SHE HAS BECOME FRIENDLY ALSO TO HIS WIFE SHE NEVER REALLY LIKED POOR GUSS NOR PERHAPS DOES THE CAPTAIN
THE LETTER HAD DECLARED THAT LITTLE POPENJOY WAS SINKING THAT WILL DO BONNI HE SAID I WILL GET INTO BED BY MYSELF
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TALKING ABOUT IT DO YOU THINK YOU OWE ME NOTHING WHAT'S THE GOOD OF OWING IF A MAN CAN'T PAY HIS DEBTS YOU WILL OWN NOTHING THEN YES I WILL IF ANYONE LEFT ME TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS TO MORROW THEN I SHOULD OWE YOU SOMETHING
BUT A BACHELOR MAY BE GOT TO MARRY LADY AMELIA GERMAIN MARY ASSURES HER THAT THERE ISN'T THE LEAST CHANCE THAT AMELIA WOULD CERTAINLY NOT ACCEPT HIM AND THAT AN OLD GERMAN OF SIXTY USED TO DIPLOMACY ALL HIS LIFE
ARE YOU GOING TO KILLANCODLEM SHE SAID I SUPPOSE I SHALL FOR A FEW DAYS HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY BEFORE YOU GO NOTHING PARTICULAR OF COURSE I DON'T MEAN TO ME
LORD BROTHERTON HAD BEEN SUMMONED AND WOULD LORD BROTHERTON COME THEY ALL BELIEVED THAT HE WAS DYING AND IF SO SURELY HE COULD NOT BE MADE TO COME BUT IS IT NOT HORRIBLE SAID LADY SUSANNA
PECUNIARY ASSISTANCE I THINK MY LORD YAH YAH I HAVE BEEN BAMBOOZLED OF EVERYTHING MY LORD MARQUIS
HAD BECOME QUITE AN INSTITUTION IN LONDON SHE HAD OBTAINED FULL THOUGH BY NO MEANS UNDISPUTED POSSESSION OF THE GREAT HALL IN THE MARYLEBONE ROAD AND WAS UNDOUBTEDLY FOR THE MOMENT
OF THE INSERTION OF HIS WIFE'S NAME DOCTOR FLEABODY WAS QUITE CLEVER ENOUGH TO MAKE FRESH CAPITAL OUT OF THIS SHE WITHDREW THE NAME EXPLAINING THAT SHE HAD BEEN ORDERED TO DO SO BY THE LADY'S HUSBAND
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SMOKE A CIGAR
MONEY MONEY MONEY NOTHING MORE UNFAIR WAS EVER SAID TO ANYONE HAVE I GIVEN ANY SIGNS OF SELLING MYSELF FOR MONEY HAVE I BEEN A FORTUNE HUNTER NO ONE HAS EVER FOUND ME GUILTY OF SO MUCH PRUDENCE
IF I WERE TO MARRY A GIRL WITHOUT A FORTUNE AND I KNOW MYSELF I'M A VERY GOOD FELLOW WHILE THE SUN SHINES BUT I COULDN'T STAND HARDSHIP I SHOULDN'T COME HOME TO THE HASHED MUTTON I SHOULD DINE AT THE CLUB EVEN THOUGH I HAD TO BORROW THE MONEY
HEAVEN KNOWS WHEN WE MAY SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN YOU WILL PROMISE ME THAT JACK YES IF YOU WISH IT AND SO AT LAST SHE HAD GOT A PROMISE FROM HIM SHE SAID NOTHING MORE TO FIX IT FEARING THAT IN DOING SO
NO MAN SHOULD TALK TO A GIRL OF MARRYING HER UNLESS HE LOVES HER IT IS DIFFERENT WITH A GIRL SHE MAY COME TO LOVE A MAN SHE MAY LOVE A MAN BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD THOUGH SHE HARDLY KNEW HIM WHEN SHE MARRIED HIM IF HE IS GOOD TO HER SHE WILL CERTAINLY DO SO
FOR HE WEARING THE PECULYA HEAD GEAR IS THE MAN HE MOST FEARS AND WHOM HE HAD HOPED NOT TO SEE THIS DAY SO MUCH IS HE AFFECTED HE DOES NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION PUT TO HIM
WHO IS THAT FELLA SHENSTONE WHAT FELLOW
I DON'T WISH ANY ONE TO BE THE WISER ABOUT OUR BIT OF AN ESCAPADE LEAST OF ALL A CERTAIN YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHOSE CHRISTIAN NAME BEGINS WITH A G AND SURNAME WITH AN S THOSE INITIALS ANSWER FOR MINE SAYS GEORGE SHENSTONE COMING FORWARD AND CONFRONTING HER
A LEGENDARY REFLECTION FROM TALES TOLD HER IN CHILDHOOD AND WILD SONGS CHAUNTED OVER HER CRADLE
A THIRD SUPPOSITION THAT SHE HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF REVENGE OF A JEALOUS LOVER'S SPITE SEEMS ALIKE UNTENABLE
POSSIBLY IN THE SCRAMBLE ON THE ROBBERS FIRST SEIZING HOLD AND HASTILY STRIPPING HER THIS PARTICULAR ONE HAD SLIPPED THROUGH THEIR FINGERS FALLEN TO THE FLOOR AND SO ESCAPED OBSERVATION AT NIGHT AND IN THE DARKNESS ALL LIKELY ENOUGH
WITHOUT A SECOND'S DELAY HE STARTS OFF TOWARDS THE LODGE IN WHICH CORACLE HAS BEEN OF LATE DOMICILED UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF ITS FORMER OCCUPANT JOSEPH PREECE ACCOMPANIED BY CAPTAIN RYECROFT AND JACK WINGATE
I SAW MADAME WRITE THE NOTE INVITING HIM INDEED TOOK IT MYSELF DOWN TO THE HALL TABLE FOR THE POST BOY HE VISITS OFTEN AT THE COURT OF LATE VERY OFTEN ONCE A WEEK SOMETIMES TWICE AND COMES DOWN THE RIVER BY BOAT DOESN'T HE
AS JOSEPH GLIDES PAST AND ON DOWN THE STAIR THEN REPEATING WHO THE DEUCE IS HE THE INTERROGATION AS BEFORE REFERRING TO HIM WHO ROWS THE PLEASURE BOAT BY THIS IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT BOW IN TO THE DOCK ITS STERN TOUCHING THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIR
THE CHANGE HE NOTES IN GEORGE SHENSTONE'S MANNER IS NOT CAUSED BY THE RETURNING PLEASURE CRAFT SIMPLY A REFLECTION WHICH CROSSING HIS MIND FOR THE MOMENT TRANQUILLISES HIM WHAT A STUPID I AM HE MUTTERS SELF ACCUSINGLY
THERE ARE OTHERS PRESENT WHO SEEK HER SMILES SOME ASPIRING TO HER HAND BUT NONE HE FEARS SO MUCH AS THE ONE STILL ABSENT JUST AS HE IS BECOMING CALM AND CONFIDENT HE IS SALUTED BY A GENTLEMAN OF THE GENUS SWELL WHO APPROACHING
THERE IS NOTHING ODD IN HIS CALLING AT THAT EARLY HOUR SIR GEORGE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF THE WYNN FAMILY WAS AN INTIMATE ASSOCIATE OF GWEN'S DECEASED FATHER AND BOTH HE AND HIS SON HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK IN AT LLANGORREN COURT SANS CEREMONIE
AT LENGTH TO CULMINATE IN CALLING HIM A MURDERER INSTEAD OF VOLUNTARILY PRESENTING HIMSELF AT LLANGORREN ALONE ARMS AND LIMBS FREE THEY EXPECTED TO SEE HIM
I WOR ALTHEGITHER CONVINCED
HE ARE A GOOD SORT AN EVERYBODY LIKES HIM SO DO SHE BUT NOT THE WAY HE WANT HER TO WELL THINGS O THAT KIND ALLERS DO GO CONTRARY WISE NEVER SEEM TO RUN SMOOTH LIKE I'D HELP HIM MYSELF IF TWAR IN MY POWER BUT IT AIN'T
AND SUCH WORDS HAVE GONE ABROAD FROM LLANGORREN COURT COUPLED WITH THE NAME OF ITS YOUNG MISTRESS GWEN WYNN IS MISSING IF SHE BE NOT ALSO MURDERED IT IS THE SECOND DAY AFTER HER DISAPPEARANCE AS KNOWN TO THE HOUSEHOLD
YOU THINK TOO LOUD MONSIEUR
NOT UNTIL THE TWO LADIES HAVE REACHED THE STAIR HEAD DO THEY BECOME AWARE OF HIS BEING THERE AND NOT THEN TILL GWEN HAS MADE SOME OBSERVATIONS TO THE COMPANION WHICH AS THOSE ADDRESSED TO THE STRANGER UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIMSELF
SINCE TO LEWIN MURDOCK AND HIS WIFE THE SOCIETY OF HEREFORDSHIRE IS TABOOED BUT THEY CAN GUESS FROM THE SYMBOLS THAT IT IS TO BE A GARDEN PARTY OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT THERE OFTEN GIVEN WHILE THEY ARE STILL GAZING ITS SPECIAL KIND IS DECLARED
IT WAS TO HIT THIS INTERLUDE OF LEISURE FATHER ROGIER HAS BEEN HURRYING
THE INVITED TO THE ARCHERY MEETING HAVE NEARLY ALL ARRIVED AND THE SHOOTING HAS COMMENCED HALF A DOZEN ARROWS IN THE AIR AT A TIME MAKING FOR AS MANY TARGETS ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF LADIES COMPETE FOR THE FIRST SCORE
AND THOUGH NOT CALLED UPON TO TAKE PART IN THEIR CONVERSATION HE LIKES LISTENING TO IT ABOVE ALL HE IS PLEASED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF MISS POWELL A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL AND TAKES NOTE OF THE ATTENTION PAID HER BY THE GENTLEMAN WHO SITS OPPOSITE
THAT HE IS A SWINDLER AND ADVENTURER ALL THAT WHILE GWEN WYNN WAS BUT MISSING NOW THAT HER BODY IS FOUND SINCE ITS DISCOVERY STILL HARSHER HAVE BEEN THE TERMS APPLIED TO HIM
IN HIS EYES ANYTHING BUT A PLEASED EXPRESSION INDEED SULLEN ALMOST ANGRY AS WATCHING HER EVERY MOVEMENT HE NOTES THE MANNER OF HER RECEPTION GREETING THE NEW COMER WITH A WARMTH AND CORDIALITY HE SHENSTONE THINKS UNCALLED FOR
AND THAT THE TEMPTER IS BY HIS SIDE HE IS MORE THAN HALF CONSCIOUS IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME FOR HIM TO LISTEN TO FELL SPEECH FROM THOSE FAIR LIPS TO DAY HE WOULD RATHER SHUN ALLUSION TO A SUBJECT SO GRAVE YET SO DELICATE
AND LINGERING THERE TILL AFTER THE LATEST GUEST HAD TAKEN DEPARTURE HEARD HIGH VOICES SPEAKING AS IN ANGER
PARTICULARLY THAT PORTION OF THE WORLD YCLEPT CHELTENHAM THE DEAR OLD LADY HA HA AFTER A LAUGH CONTINUING BUT SPEAKING SERIOUSLY NELL
HIS CONFIDENCE THAT HE WILL NOT HAVE LONG HIS WALK FOR NOTHING RESTS ON CERTAIN MATTERS OF PRE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE FOREIGN DOMESTIC HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING A CODE OF SIGNALS BY WHICH HE CAN COMMUNICATE
AND IS NOW ON THE WAY FOR IT PRETTY SURE OF BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH HIS OBJECT TRUE TO HER FASHIONABLE INSTINCTS AND TOILETTE NECESSITIES MISS LINTON KEEPS A FRENCH MAID
HIS MAY BE ONE NOT STRANGE HER SOLICITUDE WHAT MAKE IT WORSE SHE SAYS CONTINUING HER SOLILOQUY
AND WITH THE COMPASSIONATE THOUGHT STILL LINGERING SHE HEAVES A SIGH SAD AS SHE SEES HIM RIDE OUT THROUGH THE GATE GOING IN RECKLESS GALLOP BUT SUCCEEDED BY ONE OF RELIEF SOON AS HE IS OUT OF SIGHT
THAN LEAD SUCH A TRISTE LIFE AS WE'RE NOW DOING LIVING IN THIS WRETCHED KENNEL OF A HOUSE THAT THREATENS TO TUMBLE ON OUR HEADS HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIVE IN THAT OVER YONDER HE NODS TOWARDS LLANGORREN COURT YOU ARE MERRY MONSIEUR
HE DRAWS BACK TO THE PATH AND SITS DOWN UPON A STILE CLOSE BY
THOUGH RIGHT IN THE PREMISES FOR MARY MORGAN WAS A GOOD GIRL MISSUS WINGATE IS UNFORTUNATELY WRONG IN HER DEDUCTIONS BUT FORTUNATELY FOR HER PEACE OF MIND SHE IS SO
WHO HEARKENING FURTHER HEARS OTHER SPEECHES WHICH WHILE PERPLEXING HIM DO NOUGHT TO ALLAY THE WILD TEMPEST NOW SURGING THROUGH HIS SOUL UNSEEN HIMSELF FOR HE HAS STEPPED BEHIND THE TREE LATELY SCREENING JOSEPH HE SEES GWEN WYNN
HOW CAN IT GIVE YOU A BELIEF IN THE GIRL BEING STILL ALIVE QUITE ITS CONTRARY I SHOULD SAY STAY CAPTAIN THERE BE MORE TO COME
CALLED HER SON OUT SPOKE A FEW WORDS TO HIM WHEN THEY STARTED AWAY IN THE SKIFF SHE SAW THEY WENT DOWN STREAM THAT IS ALL SHE WAS SOME LITTLE SURPRISED THOUGH NOT AT THE DIRECTION TAKEN
BY FIGURES APPEARING UPON THE LAWN AND TAKING STAND IN GROUPS BEFORE THE TENT THERE ARE LADIES GAILY ATTIRED IN THE DISTANCE LOOKING LIKE BRIGHT BUTTERFLIES SOME DRESSED A LA DIANE WITH BOWS IN HAND AND QUIVERS SLUNG BY THEIR SIDES
IMPOSSIBLE TO DEPICT THE EXPRESSION ON VIVIAN RYECROFT'S FACE AS THE WORDS OF THE WATERMAN FALL UPON HIS EAR IT IS MORE THAN SURPRISE MORE THAN ASTONISHMENT INTENSELY INTERROGATIVE
HE HAS THENCE BROUGHT HER HIS BETTER HALF PHYSICALLY A FINE LOOKING WOMAN DESPITE SOME RAVAGES DUE TO TIME AND POSSIBLY MORE TO CRIME TALL AND DARK AS THE DAUGHTERS OF THE LATINIC RACE WITH FEATURES BEAUTIFUL IN THE PAST
INSTEAD VERY MODERN IN MY OPINION DISGUSTINGLY SO WHY D'Y AW SAY THAT JAWGE WHY BECAUSE IN EITHER OLDEN OR MEDIAEVAL TIMES SUCH A THING COULDN'T HAVE OCCURRED HERE IN HEREFORDSHIRE
BEIN AWARE O THAT THEIR ONLY CHANCE WOR TO GET HER OUT O MY WAY BY SOME TRICK
IT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED NOT ONLY BY THE FINDER BUT BY ELEANOR LEES AND MISS LINTON HERSELF A RARE CLUSTER OF BRILLIANTS BESIDES OF VALUE IT HAS MORE THAN ONCE RECEIVED THE INSPECTION OF THESE LADIES
EARLIER THAN USUAL SO I MUST GET BACK IMMEDIATELY
AND THERE PUT ABOARD THE FRENCH SCHOONER LA CHOUETTE CARRIED ACROSS TO BOULOGNE TO BE SHUT UP IN A CONVENT FOR LIFE ALL THESE DELICATE MATTERS MANAGED BY FATHER ROGIER BACKED BY
THE HUE AND CRY IS AT ITS LOUDEST NO LONGER CONFINED TO THE FAMILY AND DOMESTICS NO MORE THE RELATIVES AND INTIMATE FRIENDS PEOPLE OF ALL CLASSES AND KINDS TAKE PART IN IT THE PLEASURE GROUNDS OF LLANGORREN
AND TREWS BEING THE VEST AND BREECHES UNITED IN ONE PIECE AND ORNAMENTED WITH FRINGES WERE VERY COMFORTABLE AND SUITABLE TO BE WORN IN WALKING OR DANCING
AND I THREW IT FROM ME AS FAR AS I COULD OUT ON THE LOCH AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEPTH IN THE PLACE HE SHOUTED WHERE ART THOU RING AND THE RING SAID I AM HERE
BUT WITH EVERY ILL THAT BEFELL ME I GOT THE SPEAR LOOSED FROM HIM
PLAY UP WITH YOU WHY SHOULD YOU BE SILENT MAKE A CRONAN TO CONALL YELLOWCLAW SAID THE HEAD BARD I HAD NO LIKING AT ALL FOR THE CRONAN BUT UP CAME THE ONE CAT AND TEN AND IF THEY DID NOT SING ME A CRONAN THEN AND THERE
THE SERVANTS LOCKED THE DOOR AND THEY WENT AWAY WHEN THEY ROSE TO LAY HAND ON THE BROWN HORSE SAID CONALL YOU SHALL NOT DO THAT IT IS HARD TO GET OUT OF THIS LET US MAKE FOR OURSELVES FOUR HIDING HOLES
THEY DID SO SHE CRIED
AND THE LORD OF DUNLAVIN AND HIS PRETTY DAUGHTER THAT WERE STANDING AT THE PARLOUR WINDOW UNKNOWNST TO THE PORTER PUT OUT THEIR HEADS I'D BE GLAD BARNEY SAYS THE MASTER
NOW O CONALL SAID THE KING WERE YOU EVER IN A HARDER PLACE THAN TO BE SEEING YOUR LOT OF SONS HANGED TO MORROW BUT YOU SET IT TO MY GOODNESS AND TO MY GRACE AND SAY THAT IT WAS NECESSITY BROUGHT IT ON YOU SO I MUST NOT HANG YOU
AND SO THE KING HAD HIS GOOSE AS GOOD AS NEW TO DIVERT HIM AS LONG AS HE LIVED AND THE SAINT SUPPORTED HIM AFTER HE CAME INTO HIS PROPERTY AS I TOLD YOU UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH AND THAT WAS SOON AFTER FOR THE POOR GOOSE THOUGHT HE WAS CATCHING A TROUT ONE FRIDAY
AND THE POOR COCK CAME BACK FLUTTERING AND TREMBLING TO JACK AND HIS COMRADES O MUSHA NAYBOURS SAYS HE WASN'T IT THE HEIGHT O LUCK THAT THREW YOU IN MY WAY
MUCH WEALTH HAVE I EXPENDED ON YOU
THE SONS OF HIS OWN FATHER'S BROTHER WILL NOT COME BACK TO THE LAND OF THEIR HOME AND THE SOIL OF THEIR NATIVITY AND TO THE FEAST LIKEWISE AND HE HAS SENT US ON EMBASSY TO INVITE YOU
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT I WAS NEAR MY FOE AND FAR FROM MY FRIENDS AND I CALLED TO THE WOMAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AND SHE SAID TO ME WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE I TOLD HER MYSELF WORD UPON WORD HOW I CAME WELL THEN SAID SHE
THE BIRD ASKED TO GET INSIDE FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOD OF THE ELEMENTS AND YOU YOURSELF TELL ME THAT ANYTHING THAT IS ASKED IN HIS NAME WE OUGHT TO DO IF YOU WILL NOT ALLOW THE BIRD THAT IS BEING BENUMBED WITH COLD AND DONE TO DEATH WITH HUNGER TO BE LET IN
BEGRUDGE INDEED NOT ONE OF YOU WILL EVER SEE A POOR DAY IF I CAN HELP IT SO ALL WERE WELCOMED TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT AND THE ASS AND THE DOG AND THE COCK GOT THE BEST POSTS IN THE FARMYARD
FOR THOU KNOWEST ALL LANGUAGES
IN THE WOOD NOR A STAR SHINING FROM HEAVEN BUT DEIRDRE HAD A NAME FOR IT BUT ONE THING SHE DID NOT WISH HER TO HAVE EITHER PART OR PARLEY WITH ANY SINGLE LIVING MAN OF THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT ON A GLOOMY WINTER NIGHT
BUT I SEE THEE NOT I KEPT LETTING THEM OUT BY THE WAY OF ONE AND ONE AS I FLAYED THE BUCK AND BEFORE THE LAST ONE WAS OUT I HAD HIM FLAYED BAG WISE THEN I WENT AND I PUT MY LEGS IN PLACE OF HIS LEGS
THAT I'VE BEEN DISCOURSING ALL THIS TIME WITHOUT KNOWING IT SAYS HE
AND DO YOU INTERPRET IT TO ME SAID DEIRDRE THEN SHE SANG

I HAVE COME TO THEE WITH AN EMBASSY FROM ARTHUR TO ASK THEE IF THOU KNOWEST AUGHT CONCERNING MABON THE SON OF MODRON WHO WAS TAKEN AWAY AT THREE NIGHTS OLD FROM BETWEEN HIS MOTHER AND THE WALL AND THE SALMON ANSWERED

WITHOUT QUESTION AND NECESSITY MADE ME COME I AM UNDER THY PARDON AND UNDER THINE HONOUR AND UNDER THY GRACE HE TOLD HOW IT HAPPENED TO HIM AND THAT HE HAD TO GET THE BROWN HORSE FOR THE KING OF ERIN OR THAT HIS SONS WERE TO BE PUT TO DEATH
AND PUT ON HIS THIMBLE AND SET TO WORK AT THE TREWS PLYING HIS NEEDLE NIMBLY
WALK ON YOUR TIPPY TOES TILL WE SEE WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH SO THEY CREPT NEAR THE WINDOW AND THERE THEY SAW SIX ROBBERS INSIDE
AND IT WAS NOT AGREEABLE FOR THE LIKE OF ME TO ATTACK HIM
I AM NOT SAID I BUT THE ROPES ARE SO TIGHT THAT I TAKE LONG TO LOOSE THEM
THE DAY THAT CONNACHAR SENT THE INVITATION TO HIS FEAST WILL BE UNLUCKY FOR US IF WE DON'T GO O DEIRDRE YOU WILL GO THERE SAID FERCHAR MAC RO AND IF CONNACHAR SHOW KINDNESS TO YOU SHOW YE KINDNESS TO HIM
SINCE THOU WILT NOT REMAIN HERE CHIEFTAIN THOU SHALT RECEIVE THE BOON WHATSOEVER THY TONGUE MAY NAME AS FAR AS THE WIND DRIES AND THE RAIN MOISTENS AND THE SUN REVOLVES AND THE SEA ENCIRCLES AND THE EARTH EXTENDS
HE GAVE FORTH THE PIERCING SIGH OF DEATH
TO GO HOME TO OUR FATHER AND TELL THE DEEDS OF HEROISM WE HAVE DONE THAN ACCEPT ANYTHING ON THESE TERMS FROM YOU
THAT YE WILL ACHIEVE IT ACHIEVE YE THIS ADVENTURE FOR ME THESE WENT FORWARD UNTIL THEY CAME
CONALL AND HIS SONS LAID THEIR HANDS AGAIN ON THE HORSE IF THE NOISE WAS GREAT THAT HE MADE BEFORE THE NOISE THAT HE MADE NOW WAS SEVEN TIMES GREATER THE KING SENT A MESSAGE FOR HIS GILLIES AGAIN AND SAID FOR CERTAIN THERE WAS SOMETHING TROUBLING THE BROWN HORSE GO AND LOOK WELL ABOUT HIM
IN IRELAND WHERE THE BOAR TRUITH WAS WITH HIS SEVEN YOUNG PIGS AND THE DOGS WERE LET LOOSE UPON HIM FROM ALL SIDES BUT HE WASTED THE FIFTH PART OF IRELAND AND THEN SET FORTH THROUGH THE SEA TO WALES
AS FORTUNE FAVOURED ME THE BRUTE SLEPT BESIDE THE CALDRON THERE I WAS SCALDED BY THE BOTTOM OF THE CALDRON WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS ASLEEP SHE SET HER MOUTH QUIETLY TO THE HOLE THAT WAS IN THE LID AND SHE SAID TO ME WAS I ALIVE I SAID I WAS
BUT SHE WOULD BLUSH FIERY RED OVER IT THE WOMAN THAT HAD CHARGE OF HER GAVE DEIRDRE EVERY INFORMATION AND SKILL OF WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL THERE WAS NOT A BLADE OF GRASS GROWING FROM ROOT NOR A BIRD SINGING
HE HAD NO SOONER GOT INSIDE THE GATE AND SHUT IT THAN THE MONSTER CAME UP TO IT AND ENRAGED AT LOSING HIS PRIZE STRUCK THE WALL ABOVE THE GATE AND LEFT THERE THE MARK OF HIS FIVE GREAT FINGERS
LOVELY TO ME AT THE TRYSTING PLACE CAME THY CLEAR VOICE THROUGH THE WOODS OF IRELAND I CANNOT EAT OR SMILE HENCEFORTH BREAK NOT TO DAY MY HEART SOON ENOUGH SHALL I LIE WITHIN MY GRAVE STRONG ARE THE WAVES OF SORROW
HONOUR BRIGHT SAYS KING O'TOOLE HOLDING OUT HIS FIST HONOUR BRIGHT SAYS SAINT KAVIN BACK AGAIN IT'S A BARGAIN COME HERE SAYS HE TO THE POOR OLD GOOSE
SHE PLACED A SEAT IN THE PLACE FOR SITTING FOOD IN THE PLACE FOR EATING AND DRINK IN THE PLACE FOR DRINKING FOR THE MAN WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE
AND KNEW THAT SOME ONE WAS LOOKING AT HER FROM THE BACK OF THE DOOR LEAF HE SEIZED ONE OF THE DICE ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM AND FIRED IT THROUGH THE BICKER HOLE AND KNOCKED THE EYE OUT OF GELBAN GREDNACH THE CHEERFUL AND CHARMING RIGHT THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
IT WAS TO THEM AS FUEL WITH WHICH TO LIGHT THEIR FIRE AND ARTHUR CALLED BEDWYR WHO NEVER SHRANK FROM ANY ENTERPRISE UPON WHICH KAY WAS BOUND NONE WAS EQUAL TO HIM IN SWIFTNESS THROUGHOUT THIS ISLAND EXCEPT ARTHUR
REPEATED THE GENERAL VASSILI VASSILITCH HEY YOUR EXCELLENCY A PERFECTLY NEW VOICE SHOUTED LOUDLY AND AGGRESSIVELY FROM CLOSE BESIDE AVDOTYA IGNATYEVNA
THEN AN ENGINEER HALF WOKE UP BUT FOR A LONG TIME MUTTERED ABSOLUTE NONSENSE SO THAT OUR FRIENDS LEFT OFF WORRYING HIM AND LET HIM LIE TILL HE WAS READY AT LAST THE DISTINGUISHED LADY WHO HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE MORNING UNDER THE CATAFALQUE
HE HAD NEVER DRUNK VODKA BEFORE HE FELT AS THOUGH HE WERE ROLLING DOWN A HILL WERE FLYING FLYING FLYING THAT HE MUST STOP HIMSELF CATCH AT SOMETHING BUT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF IT HIS POSITION WAS CERTAINLY BECOMING MORE AND MORE ECCENTRIC
