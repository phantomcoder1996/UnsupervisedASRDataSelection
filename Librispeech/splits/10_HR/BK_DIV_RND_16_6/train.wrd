AND NOW THEY WERE TAKING HIM OUT TO BE SLAUGHTERED THE REGIMENT SLID DOWN A BANK AND WALLOWED ACROSS A LITTLE STREAM THE MOURNFUL CURRENT MOVED SLOWLY ON AND FROM THE WATER SHADED BLACK
THE BODY SEEMED TO BOUNCE A LITTLE WAY FROM THE EARTH GOD SAID THE TATTERED SOLDIER THE YOUTH HAD WATCHED SPELLBOUND THIS CEREMONY AT THE PLACE OF MEETING
THERE WAS A WAIT IN THIS PART OF THE FIELD THERE PASSED SLOWLY THE INTENSE MOMENTS THAT PRECEDE THE TEMPEST A SINGLE RIFLE FLASHED IN A THICKET BEFORE THE REGIMENT IN AN INSTANT IT WAS JOINED BY MANY OTHERS
TO DISCOVER WHEN HE WOULD RUN WHEREVER HE WENT IN CAMP HE WOULD ENCOUNTER INSOLENT AND LINGERINGLY CRUEL STARES AS HE IMAGINED HIMSELF PASSING NEAR A CROWD OF COMRADES HE COULD HEAR ONE SAY
WITHIN THE GLEAM OF ROSE AND ORANGE LIGHT FROM THE BURNING STICKS WERE OTHER SOLDIERS SNORING AND HEAVING OR LYING DEATHLIKE IN SLUMBER A FEW PAIRS OF LEGS WERE STUCK FORTH RIGID AND STRAIGHT
TO THE LIGHT AND SPEEDY INFANTRY OF PRACTICE THE REGIMENT RELIEVED OF A BURDEN RECEIVED A NEW IMPETUS BUT THERE WAS MUCH LOSS OF VALUABLE KNAPSACKS AND ON THE WHOLE VERY GOOD SHIRTS
AS HE WAS AT LAST COMPELLED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THEM HIS CAPACITY FOR SELF HATE WAS MULTIPLIED IN DESPAIR HE DECLARED THAT HE WAS NOT LIKE THOSE OTHERS HE NOW CONCEDED IT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD EVER BECOME A HERO
SOME WHITE BUBBLE EYES LOOKED AT THE MEN AS THEY CLIMBED THE HILL ON THE FARTHER SIDE ARTILLERY BEGAN TO BOOM HERE THE YOUTH FORGOT MANY THINGS AS HE FELT A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF CURIOSITY
THE OTHER GOT CAREFULLY ERECT AND THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER LED HIM AMONG THE SLEEPING FORMS LYING IN GROUPS AND ROWS
BECAUSE OF THE TATTERED SOLDIER'S QUESTION HE NOW FELT THAT HIS SHAME COULD BE VIEWED HE WAS CONTINUALLY CASTING SIDELONG GLANCES TO SEE IF THE MEN WERE CONTEMPLATING THE LETTERS OF GUILT HE FELT BURNED INTO HIS BROW
HE STARED INTO SPACE TO THE TWO WATCHERS THERE WAS A CURIOUS AND PROFOUND DIGNITY IN THE FIRM LINES OF HIS AWFUL FACE HE WAS INVADED BY A CREEPING STRANGENESS THAT SLOWLY ENVELOPED HIM
WHISPERED THE MAN AT THE YOUTH'S ELBOW THEY SHRANK BACK AND CROUCHED AS IF COMPELLED TO AWAIT A FLOOD THE YOUTH SHOT A SWIFT GLANCE ALONG THE BLUE RANKS OF THE REGIMENT THE PROFILES WERE MOTIONLESS
THE SUN SPREAD DISCLOSING RAYS AND ONE BY ONE REGIMENTS BURST INTO VIEW LIKE ARMED MEN JUST BORN OF THE EARTH THE YOUTH PERCEIVED THAT THE TIME HAD COME HE WAS ABOUT TO BE MEASURED
BEATING UPON IT MADE IT GLOW A LIGHT YELLOW SHADE A SMALL WINDOW SHOT AN OBLIQUE SQUARE OF WHITER LIGHT UPON THE CLUTTERED FLOOR THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRE AT TIMES NEGLECTED THE CLAY CHIMNEY AND WREATHED INTO THE ROOM AND THIS FLIMSY CHIMNEY OF CLAY AND STICKS
WILD YELLS CAME FROM BEHIND THE WALLS OF SMOKE A SKETCH IN GRAY AND RED DISSOLVED INTO A MOBLIKE BODY OF MEN WHO GALLOPED LIKE WILD HORSES THE VETERAN REGIMENTS ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE THREE HUNDRED FOURTH IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO JEER
WELL THEN WHAT DID THEY MARCH US OUT HERE FOR HE DEMANDED OF THE TALL SOLDIER THE LATTER WITH CALM FAITH BEGAN A HEAVY EXPLANATION
THE WHITE TOPPED WAGONS STRAINED AND STUMBLED IN THEIR EXERTIONS LIKE FAT SHEEP THE YOUTH FELT COMFORTED IN A MEASURE BY THIS SIGHT THEY WERE ALL RETREATING PERHAPS THEN HE WAS NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL
NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE WE GO OR WHY WE GO WE JUST GET FIRED AROUND FROM PILLAR TO POST AND GET LICKED HERE AND GET LICKED THERE AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S DONE FOR IT MAKES A MAN FEEL LIKE A DAMN KITTEN IN A BAG
HIS HEAD FELL FORWARD ON HIS CROOKED ARM AND HIS WEIGHTED LIDS WENT SOFTLY DOWN OVER HIS EYES HEARING A SPLATTER OF MUSKETRY FROM THE DISTANCE HE WONDERED INDIFFERENTLY IF THOSE MEN SOMETIMES SLEPT
ALSO HE WAS DRILLED AND DRILLED AND REVIEWED AND DRILLED AND DRILLED AND REVIEWED THE ONLY FOES HE HAD SEEN WERE SOME PICKETS ALONG THE RIVER BANK THEY WERE A SUN TANNED PHILOSOPHICAL LOT
IF THE ARMY HAD GONE GLORIOUSLY ON HE WOULD BE LOST IF THE DIN MEANT THAT NOW HIS ARMY'S FLAGS WERE TILTED FORWARD HE WAS A CONDEMNED WRETCH HE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO DOOM HIMSELF TO ISOLATION
HE WAS A CRAVEN LOON THOSE PICTURES OF GLORY WERE PITEOUS THINGS HE GROANED FROM HIS HEART AND WENT STAGGERING OFF A CERTAIN MOTHLIKE QUALITY WITHIN HIM KEPT HIM IN THE VICINITY OF THE BATTLE
HE COULD SEE THE FORMS OF MEN THROWING BLACK SHADOWS IN THE RED LIGHT AND AS HE WENT NEARER IT BECAME KNOWN TO HIM IN SOME WAY THAT THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH SLEEPING MEN
I GOT SHOT YES B'JIMINEY I GOT SHOT HE REITERATED THIS FACT IN A BEWILDERED WAY AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT CAME ABOUT
STANDING BEFORE A CRIMSON AND STEEL ASSAULT GETTING CALMLY KILLED ON A HIGH PLACE BEFORE THE EYES OF ALL HE THOUGHT OF THE MAGNIFICENT PATHOS OF HIS DEAD BODY THESE THOUGHTS UPLIFTED HIM
WHO SOMETIMES SHOT REFLECTIVELY AT THE BLUE PICKETS WHEN REPROACHED FOR THIS AFTERWARD THEY USUALLY EXPRESSED SORROW AND SWORE BY THEIR GODS THAT THE GUNS HAD EXPLODED WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION THE YOUTH ON GUARD DUTY ONE NIGHT CONVERSED ACROSS THE STREAM WITH ONE OF THEM
THUNDER SAID THE YOUTH OH YOU'LL SEE FIGHTING THIS TIME MY BOY WHAT'LL BE REGULAR OUT AND OUT FIGHTING
HE TILTED HIS HEAD AFAR BACK AND HELD THE CANTEEN LONG TO HIS LIPS THE COOL MIXTURE WENT CARESSINGLY DOWN HIS BLISTERED THROAT HAVING FINISHED HE SIGHED WITH COMFORTABLE DELIGHT
FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FALL HE CONSIDERED NOW HOWEVER THAT IT WAS USELESS TO THINK OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY
BEGAN QUAVERINGLY TO QUESTION HIM WHERE YEH GOIN JIM WHAT YOU THINKING ABOUT WHERE YOU GOING TELL ME WON'T YOU JIM THE TALL SOLDIER FACED ABOUT AS UPON RELENTLESS PURSUERS
NUMBERS MAKING FUTILE BIDS FOR THE POPULAR
THEY WERE WORN EXHAUSTED HAVING SLEPT BUT LITTLE AND LABORED MUCH
THERE WAS A DULL WEIGHT LIKE FEELING IN HIS STOMACH AND WHEN HE TRIED TO WALK HIS HEAD SWAYED AND HE TOTTERED HE COULD NOT SEE WITH DISTINCTNESS SMALL PATCHES OF GREEN MIST FLOATED BEFORE HIS VISION
HE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH SOME NEW THOUGHTS THAT HAD LATELY COME TO HIM HE LAY DOWN ON A WIDE BUNK THAT STRETCHED ACROSS THE END OF THE ROOM IN THE OTHER END CRACKER BOXES WERE MADE TO SERVE AS FURNITURE
OF A SUDDEN HE FELT A HEAVY AND SAD HAND LAID UPON HIS SHOULDER AWAKENING FROM HIS TRANCE OF OBSERVATION HE TURNED AND BEHELD THE LOUD SOLDIER
PRESENTLY THE LATTER HEARD A VOICE TALKING SOFTLY NEAR HIS SHOULDER TURNING HE SAW THAT IT BELONGED TO THE TATTERED SOLDIER
SHOWED IN A LAUGH AS THE FLAP OF THE BLUE JACKET FELL AWAY FROM THE BODY HE COULD SEE THAT THE SIDE LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN CHEWED BY WOLVES THE YOUTH TURNED
THE TALL SOLDIER TURNED AND LURCHING DANGEROUSLY WENT ON THE YOUTH AND THE TATTERED SOLDIER FOLLOWED SNEAKING AS IF WHIPPED FEELING UNABLE TO FACE THE STRICKEN MAN IF HE SHOULD AGAIN CONFRONT THEM
YOU'VE BEEN JAWIN LIKE A LOT A OLD HENS
HE PRESENTLY BEGAN A LONG AND INTRICATE DENUNCIATION OF THE COMMANDER OF THE FORCES MEBBE IT WA'N'T ALL HIS FAULT NOT ALL TOGETHER
I'VE GOT YOUR THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER SNARLED
THE YOUTH FORGETTING HIS NEAT PLAN OF GETTING KILLED GAZED SPELL BOUND HIS EYES GREW WIDE AND BUSY WITH THE ACTION OF THE SCENE HIS MOUTH WAS A LITTLE WAYS OPEN
I GUESS YEH'LL COME OUT ABOUT RIGHT YEH MUST ALLUS REMEMBER YER FATHER TOO CHILD AN REMEMBER HE NEVER DRUNK A DROP OF LICKER IN HIS LIFE AND SELDOM SWORE A CROSS OATH
IT LOOKED TO BE A WRONG PLACE FOR A BATTLE FIELD THE SKIRMISHERS IN ADVANCE FASCINATED HIM
NOW HENRY HE SAID LET'S HAVE LOOK AT YER OL HEAD
THAT PERHAPS IN A BATTLE HE MIGHT RUN HE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT THAT AS FAR AS WAR WAS CONCERNED HE KNEW NOTHING OF HIMSELF
IN HIS REPLY THE FRIEND'S VOICE WAS STERN A COURSE NOT HE SAID
PRESENTLY THE CALM HEAD OF A FORWARD GOING COLUMN OF INFANTRY APPEARED IN THE ROAD IT CAME SWIFTLY ON AVOIDING THE OBSTRUCTIONS GAVE IT THE SINUOUS MOVEMENT OF A SERPENT THE MEN AT THE HEAD
HE HAD A GREAT DESIRE TO SEE AND TO GET NEWS HE WISHED TO KNOW WHO WAS WINNING HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT DESPITE HIS UNPRECEDENTED SUFFERING HE HAD NEVER LOST HIS GREED FOR A VICTORY
THE RAVING TEAMSTERS SWORE MANY STRANGE OATHS THE COMMANDS TO MAKE WAY HAD THE RING OF A GREAT IMPORTANCE IN THEM THE MEN WERE GOING FORWARD TO THE HEART OF THE DIN THEY WERE TO CONFRONT THE EAGER RUSH OF THE ENEMY
HE SUSPECTED THEM TO BE IMPOSSIBLE PICTURES
TO BID ADIEU TO MANY SCHOOLMATES THEY HAD THRONGED ABOUT HIM WITH WONDER AND ADMIRATION HE HAD FELT THE GULF NOW BETWEEN THEM AND HAD SWELLED WITH CALM PRIDE HE AND SOME OF HIS FELLOWS WHO HAD DONNED BLUE
WAS A SERIES OF DEATH STRUGGLES WITH SMALL TIME IN BETWEEN FOR SLEEP AND MEALS BUT SINCE HIS REGIMENT HAD COME TO THE FIELD THE ARMY HAD DONE LITTLE
HE BELIEVED THAT HE ENVIED A CORPSE THINKING OF THE SLAIN HE ACHIEVED A GREAT CONTEMPT FOR SOME OF THEM AS IF THEY WERE GUILTY FOR THUS BECOMING LIFELESS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN KILLED BY LUCKY CHANCES HE SAID
THERE WAS A REPLY THAT THE INTENT FIGHTERS DID NOT CARE FOR WHAT HAPPENED REARWARD SAVING THAT NO HOSTILE BAYONETS APPEARED THERE IN THE BATTLE BLUR HIS FACE WOULD IN A WAY BE HIDDEN LIKE THE FACE OF A COWLED MAN
HE BECAME AWARE THAT THE FURNACE ROAR OF THE BATTLE WAS GROWING LOUDER GREAT BLOWN CLOUDS HAD FLOATED TO THE STILL HEIGHTS OF AIR BEFORE HIM THE NOISE TOO WAS APPROACHING
JERKED THE ROPE FRANTICALLY TO TELL THE TWISTED NEWS OF A GREAT BATTLE THIS VOICE OF THE PEOPLE REJOICING IN THE NIGHT HAD MADE HIM SHIVER IN A PROLONGED ECSTASY OF EXCITEMENT LATER HE HAD GONE DOWN TO HIS MOTHER'S ROOM AND HAD SPOKEN THUS MA
AND WAS IN TRUTH A MAN OF TRADITIONAL COURAGE
THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER WATCHED HIS COMRADE WITH AN AIR OF SATISFACTION HE LATER PRODUCED AN EXTENSIVE HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS POCKET
A SHELL SCREAMING LIKE A STORM BANSHEE WENT OVER THE HUDDLED HEADS OF THE RESERVES IT LANDED IN THE GROVE AND EXPLODING REDLY FLUNG THE BROWN EARTH THERE WAS A LITTLE SHOWER OF PINE NEEDLES
BUT HIS REGIMENT WENT UNMOLESTED TO A CAMPING PLACE
LESS TALKIN AN MORE FIGHTIN IS WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU BOYS I NEVER SAW SECH GABBLING JACKASSES HE PAUSED READY TO POUNCE UPON ANY MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE THE TEMERITY TO REPLY
THE YOUTH REMAINED ON THE GROUND LIKE A PARCEL HE STARED WITH A VACANT LOOK INTO THE FIRE AFTER A TIME HE AROUSED FOR SOME PART AND THE THINGS ABOUT HIM BEGAN TO TAKE FORM HE SAW THAT THE GROUND IN THE DEEP SHADOWS WAS CLUTTERED WITH MEN
THEY ATE THEIR NOON MEAL BEHIND A THIRD ONE THEY WERE MOVED FROM THIS ONE ALSO THEY WERE MARCHED FROM PLACE TO PLACE WITH APPARENT AIMLESSNESS
THE BATTLE ROAR SETTLED TO A ROLLING THUNDER WHICH WAS A SINGLE LONG EXPLOSION IN THE REGIMENT THERE WAS A PECULIAR KIND OF HESITATION DENOTED IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE MEN
SOMETIMES IT WENT UP IN LITTLE BALLS WHITE AND COMPACT DURING THIS HALT MANY MEN IN THE REGIMENT BEGAN ERECTING TINY HILLS IN FRONT OF THEM
THE YOUTH FELL BACK IN THE PROCESSION UNTIL THE TATTERED SOLDIER WAS NOT IN SIGHT THEN HE STARTED TO WALK ON WITH THE OTHERS BUT HE WAS AMID WOUNDS THE MOB OF MEN WAS BLEEDING
THE YOUTH CRIED OUT TO HIM HYSTERICALLY I LL TAKE CARE OF YEH JIM I LL TAKE CARE OF YEH I SWEAR T GAWD I WILL SURE WILL YEH HENRY THE TALL SOLDIER BESEECHED YES YES I TELL YEH I'LL TAKE CARE OF YEH JIM PROTESTED THE YOUTH
STORIES OF DISASTER WERE BORNE INTO THEIR MINDS WITH MANY PROOFS THIS DIN OF MUSKETRY ON THE RIGHT GROWING LIKE A RELEASED GENIE OF SOUND EXPRESSED AND EMPHASIZED THE ARMY'S PLIGHT THE MEN WERE DISHEARTENED AND BEGAN TO MUTTER
IT'S OUR LUCK T GIT LICKED OFTEN SAID HIS FRIEND IN A WEARY TONE HE WAS TRUDGING ALONG WITH STOOPED SHOULDERS AND SHIFTING EYES LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CANED AND KICKED WELL DON'T WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL
MADE ENDLESS THREATS TO SET ABLAZE THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT
IF SO BE A TIME COMES WHEN YEH HAVE TO BE KILT OF DO A MEAN THING WHY HENRY
AND ONCE AS HIS FRIEND ROLLED HIS EYES HE SAW SOMETHING IN THEM THAT MADE HIM SINK WAILING TO THE GROUND HE RAISED HIS VOICE IN A LAST SUPREME CALL JIM JIM JIM
POOR OL BOY WE MUST HOL ON A MINNIT WHAT AM I DOIN I'LL CALL SIMPSON ANOTHER FIGURE AT THAT MOMENT LOOMED IN THE GLOOM
THE DISORDERED HURRYING LINES OF THE ENEMY COULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN DOWN THROUGH THE GROVES AND LITTLE FIELDS THEY WERE YELLING SHRILL AND EXULTANT AT THIS SIGHT THE YOUTH FORGOT MANY PERSONAL MATTERS AND BECAME GREATLY ENRAGED HE EXPLODED IN LOUD SENTENCES
DUST STAINED HAGGARD PANTING FLYING TO THE FRONT AT THE PROPER MOMENT TO SEIZE AND THROTTLE THE DARK LEERING WITCH OF CALAMITY THEN THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE THING BEGAN TO DRAG AT HIM HE HESITATED
HE WOULD DIE HE WOULD GO TO SOME PLACE WHERE HE WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IT WAS USELESS TO EXPECT APPRECIATION OF HIS PROFOUND AND FINE SENSE FROM SUCH MEN AS THE LIEUTENANT
WELL CRIED THE YOUTH STILL FIDGETING
ITS RAYS SHINING UPON THE MOVING MASSES OF TROOPS BROUGHT FORTH HERE AND THERE SUDDEN GLEAMS OF SILVER OR GOLD UPON THE OTHER SHORE A DARK AND MYSTERIOUS RANGE OF HILLS WAS CURVED AGAINST THE SKY
HE BEGAN TO STOW VARIOUS ARTICLES SNUGLY INTO HIS KNAPSACK THE YOUTH PAUSING IN HIS NERVOUS WALK LOOKED DOWN AT THE BUSY FIGURE GOING TO BE A BATTLE SURE IS THERE JIM
THE GENERALS WERE IDIOTS TO SEND THEM MARCHING INTO A REGULAR PEN THERE WAS BUT ONE PAIR OF EYES IN THE CORPS HE WOULD STEP FORTH AND MAKE A SPEECH
COULD FIND EXCUSES IN THAT LONG SEETHING LANE THEY COULD RETIRE WITH PERFECT SELF RESPECT AND MAKE EXCUSES TO THE STARS HE WONDERED WHAT THOSE MEN HAD EATEN THAT THEY COULD BE IN SUCH HASTE
WAS UPON THE LOG WALLS AND THREE RIFLES WERE PARALLELED ON PEGS EQUIPMENTS HUNG ON HANDY PROJECTIONS AND SOME TIN DISHES LAY UPON A SMALL PILE OF FIREWOOD A FOLDED TENT WAS SERVING AS A ROOF THE SUNLIGHT WITHOUT
THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO MINGLE IN ONE OF THOSE GREAT AFFAIRS OF THE EARTH HE HAD OF COURSE DREAMED OF BATTLES ALL HIS LIFE OF VAGUE AND BLOODY CONFLICTS THAT HAD THRILLED HIM WITH THEIR SWEEP AND FIRE IN VISIONS HE HAD SEEN HIMSELF IN MANY STRUGGLES
HE SCRAMBLED UP THE BANK WITH A SPEED THAT COULD NOT BE EXCEEDED BY A BLOODTHIRSTY MAN HE EXPECTED A BATTLE SCENE THERE WERE SOME LITTLE FIELDS GIRTED AND SQUEEZED BY A FOREST
LEAVE ME BE THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE WHILE HE WAITED SUDDENLY HIS FORM STIFFENED AND STRAIGHTENED
REGARDING DEATH THUS OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE HE CONCEIVED IT TO BE NOTHING BUT REST AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A MOMENTARY ASTONISHMENT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY COMMOTION OVER THE MERE MATTER OF GETTING KILLED
THE HATS OF A REGIMENT SHOULD PROPERLY REPRESENT THE HISTORY OF HEADGEAR FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS AND MOREOVER THERE WERE NO LETTERS OF FADED GOLD SPEAKING FROM THE COLORS THEY WERE NEW AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE COLOR BEARER HABITUALLY OILED THE POLE
STILL HE COULD NOT PUT A WHOLE FAITH IN VETERAN'S TALES FOR RECRUITS WERE THEIR PREY
YER A RIGHT DUM GOOD FELLER THIS SENTIMENT FLOATING TO HIM UPON THE STILL AIR HAD MADE HIM TEMPORARILY REGRET WAR
THERE WAS PERSPIRATION AND GRUMBLINGS AFTER A TIME THEY BEGAN TO SHED THEIR KNAPSACKS SOME TOSSED THEM UNCONCERNEDLY DOWN OTHERS HID THEM CAREFULLY ASSERTING THEIR PLANS TO RETURN FOR THEM AT SOME CONVENIENT TIME
IN THEIR PRESENCE HE COULD NOT PERSIST IN FLYING HIGH WITH THE WINGS OF WAR THEY RENDERED IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SEE HIMSELF IN A HEROIC LIGHT HE TUMBLED HEADLONG HE DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD A SCORCHING THIRST
BILL WASN'T SCARED EITHER NO SIR IT WASN'T THAT
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER AND DARKER GIRL WHOM HE HAD GAZED AT STEADFASTLY AND HE THOUGHT SHE GREW DEMURE AND SAD AT SIGHT OF HIS BLUE AND BRASS
BY GINGER I'M GLAD T SEE YEH I GIVE YEH UP FER A GONER I THOUGHT YEH WAS DEAD SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS HUSKY EMOTION IN HIS VOICE THE YOUTH FOUND THAT NOW HE COULD BARELY STAND UPON HIS FEET
THE INSECT VOICES OF THE NIGHT SANG SOLEMNLY AFTER THIS CROSSING THE YOUTH ASSURED HIMSELF THAT AT ANY MOMENT THEY MIGHT BE SUDDENLY AND FEARFULLY ASSAULTED FROM THE CAVES OF THE LOWERING WOODS HE KEPT HIS EYES WATCHFULLY UPON THE DARKNESS
THEY PERSISTENTLY YELLED FRESH FISH AT HIM AND WERE IN NO WISE TO BE TRUSTED HOWEVER HE PERCEIVED NOW THAT IT DID NOT GREATLY MATTER WHAT KIND OF SOLDIERS HE WAS GOING TO FIGHT SO LONG AS THEY FOUGHT WHICH FACT NO ONE DISPUTED
AT THIS TIME THERE WAS AN INTERPOSITION BY THE SAVAGE MINDED LIEUTENANT WHO WAS OBLIGED TO VENT SOME OF HIS INWARD DISSATISFACTION UPON HIS MEN YOU BOYS SHUT RIGHT UP
HIS LOWER JAW HUNG DOWN AS IF LACKING STRENGTH TO ASSUME ITS NORMAL POSITION HE WAS THE PICTURE OF AN EXHAUSTED SOLDIER AFTER A FEAST OF WAR HE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE TO SLEEP WITH HIS SWORD IN HIS ARMS
HANNISES BATT'RY IS TOOK
AND THE INSECTS NODDING UPON THEIR PERCHES CROONED LIKE OLD WOMEN THE YOUTH RETURNED TO HIS THEORY OF A BLUE DEMONSTRATION ONE GRAY DAWN HOWEVER HE WAS KICKED IN THE LEG BY THE TALL SOLDIER
THESE FACES EXPRESSED IN THEIR LINES THE DEEP STUPOR OF THE TIRED SOLDIERS THEY MADE THEM APPEAR LIKE MEN DRUNK WITH WINE THIS BIT OF FOREST MIGHT HAVE APPEARED TO AN ETHEREAL WANDERER
LIKE BIRDS BUT THEY WERE NOW FOR THE MOST PART BLACK CREATURES WHO FLAPPED THEIR WINGS DREARILY NEAR TO THE GROUND AND REFUSED TO RISE ON ANY WINGS OF HOPE THE MEN'S FACES GREW DOLEFUL FROM THE INTERPRETING OF OMENS
AND IN HIS DESPERATION HE CONCLUDED THAT THE STUPIDITY DID NOT GREATLY MATTER ONCE HE THOUGHT HE HAD CONCLUDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GET KILLED DIRECTLY AND END HIS TROUBLES
THEY WERE ALL GOING TO BE SACRIFICED THE GENERALS WERE STUPIDS THE ENEMY WOULD PRESENTLY SWALLOW THE WHOLE COMMAND HE GLARED ABOUT HIM EXPECTING TO SEE THE STEALTHY APPROACH OF HIS DEATH
A MOUNTED OFFICER DISPLAYED THE FURIOUS ANGER OF A SPOILED CHILD HE RAGED WITH HIS HEAD HIS ARMS AND HIS LEGS ANOTHER
HE SAID ALOUD HE FELT THAT IN THIS CRISIS HIS LAWS OF LIFE WERE USELESS
AND WITH THE LIGHT OF EXCITEMENT AND EXPECTANCY IN HIS EYES ALMOST DEFEATING THE GLOW OF REGRET FOR THE HOME BONDS HE HAD SEEN TWO TEARS LEAVING THEIR TRAILS ON HIS MOTHER'S SCARRED CHEEKS STILL
SPRAWLING IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE POSTURE GLANCING NARROWLY INTO THE MORE DISTANT DARKNESS HE CAUGHT OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF VISAGES THAT LOOMED PALLID AND GHOSTLY LIT WITH A PHOSPHORESCENT GLOW
HIS MUSKET BOUNCED A TRIFLE FROM HIS SHOULDER AT EACH STRIDE AND MADE HIS CAP FEEL UNCERTAIN UPON HIS HEAD HE COULD HEAR THE MEN WHISPER JERKY SENTENCES SAY WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT
SIGNING TO THEM TO GO ON AND LEAVE HIM ALONE THE SHADOWS OF HIS FACE WERE DEEPENING AND HIS TIGHT LIPS SEEMED HOLDING IN CHECK THE MOAN OF GREAT DESPAIR THERE COULD BE SEEN A CERTAIN STIFFNESS IN THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS BODY
SOMETHING IN THE GESTURE OF THE MAN AS HE WAVED THE BLOODY AND PITYING SOLDIERS AWAY MADE THE YOUTH START AS IF BITTEN HE YELLED IN HORROR TOTTERING FORWARD HE LAID A QUIVERING HAND UPON THE MAN'S ARM
TER'BLE FIGHTIN OVER THERE I HAD AN AWFUL TIME I GOT SEPARATED FROM THE REG'MENT
YOU TO TAKE THESE HERE THINGS TO MY FOLKS HE ENDED IN A QUAVERING SOB OF PITY FOR HIMSELF HE HANDED THE YOUTH A LITTLE PACKET DONE UP IN A YELLOW ENVELOPE WHY WHAT THE DEVIL BEGAN THE YOUTH AGAIN
HE HAD REFRAINED FROM ADDING EXTENSIVELY TO THE COMFORT OF HIS ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE HE HAD FELT THAT THE ARMY MIGHT START ON THE MARCH AT ANY MOMENT OF LATE HOWEVER HE HAD BEEN IMPRESSED THAT THEY WERE IN A SORT OF ETERNAL CAMP MANY OF THE MEN ENGAGED IN A SPIRITED DEBATE ONE
AS IF THEY WERE INVESTIGATING SOMETHING THAT HAD FASCINATED THEM ONE OR TWO STEPPED WITH OVERVALIANT AIRS AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY PLUNGED INTO WAR
HE HAD PRIVATELY PRIMED HIMSELF FOR A BEAUTIFUL SCENE
WERE QUITE OVERWHELMED WITH PRIVILEGES FOR ALL OF ONE AFTERNOON AND IT HAD BEEN A VERY DELICIOUS THING THEY HAD STRUTTED A CERTAIN LIGHT HAIRED GIRL HAD MADE VIVACIOUS FUN AT HIS MARTIAL SPIRIT
ALSO HE CONTINUED IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE IF HE FOUND HIS REGIMENT WELL HE COULD FIGHT WITH ANY REGIMENT HE STARTED FORWARD SLOWLY HE STEPPED AS IF HE EXPECTED TO TREAD UPON SOME EXPLOSIVE THING
THE YOUTH LOOKED KEENLY AT THE ASHEN FACE THE WIND RAISED THE TAWNY BEARD IT MOVED AS IF A HAND WERE STROKING IT HE VAGUELY DESIRED TO WALK AROUND AND AROUND THE BODY AND STARE
THE TALL ONE RED FACED SWALLOWED ANOTHER SANDWICH AS IF TAKING POISON IN DESPAIR
SPREAD OVER THE GRASS AND IN AMONG THE TREE TRUNKS HE COULD SEE KNOTS AND WAVING LINES OF SKIRMISHERS WHO WERE RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER AND FIRING AT THE LANDSCAPE A DARK BATTLE LINE LAY UPON A SUNSTRUCK CLEARING THAT GLEAMED ORANGE COLOR
AND FAILED IN AN EFFORT TO SEE HIMSELF STANDING STOUTLY IN THE MIDST OF THEM HE RECALLED HIS VISIONS OF BROKEN BLADED GLORY
SMOKE CLOUDS WENT SLOWLY AND INSOLENTLY ACROSS THE FIELDS LIKE OBSERVANT PHANTOMS THE DIN BECAME CRESCENDO LIKE THE ROAR OF AN ONCOMING TRAIN
BILL HE RAISED A HELUVA ROW I HEAR HE'S A FUNNY FELLER THE DIN IN FRONT SWELLED TO A TREMENDOUS CHORUS THE YOUTH AND HIS FELLOWS WERE FROZEN TO SILENCE THEY COULD SEE A FLAG THAT TOSSED IN THE SMOKE ANGRILY
HE HAD FELT GROWING WITHIN HIM THE STRENGTH TO DO MIGHTY DEEDS OF ARMS AFTER COMPLICATED JOURNEYINGS WITH MANY PAUSES
THE RIFLE WAS LOWERED TO A POSITION OF CAUTION AND THE LOUD SOLDIER CAME SLOWLY FORWARD HE PEERED INTO THE YOUTH'S FACE THAT YOU HENRY YES IT'S IT'S ME
HE SEATED HIMSELF AND WATCHED THE TERROR STRICKEN WAGONS THEY FLED LIKE SOFT UNGAINLY ANIMALS ALL THE ROARERS AND LASHERS SERVED TO HELP HIM TO MAGNIFY THE DANGERS AND HORRORS OF THE ENGAGEMENT
CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE YOUTH WENT SLOWLY TOWARD THE FIRE INDICATED BY HIS DEPARTED FRIEND AS HE REELED HE BETHOUGHT HIM OF THE WELCOME HIS COMRADES WOULD GIVE HIM
EACH OF WHICH HAD BEEN AN ENGINEERING FEAT WORTHY OF BEING MADE SACRED TO THE NAME OF HIS GRANDMOTHER IN THE AFTERNOON THE REGIMENT WENT OUT OVER THE SAME GROUND IT HAD TAKEN IN THE MORNING
A HOUSE STANDING PLACIDLY IN DISTANT FIELDS HAD TO HIM AN OMINOUS LOOK THE SHADOWS OF THE WOODS WERE FORMIDABLE HE WAS CERTAIN THAT IN THIS VISTA THERE LURKED FIERCE EYED HOSTS
THEY WOULD JEER HIM AND IF PRACTICABLE PELT HIM WITH MISSILES ADMITTING THAT HE MIGHT BE WRONG A FRENZIED DECLAMATION OF THE KIND WOULD TURN HIM INTO A WORM
THE NOISE OF FIRING DOGGED THEIR FOOTSTEPS SOMETIMES IT SEEMED TO BE DRIVEN A LITTLE WAY BUT IT ALWAYS RETURNED AGAIN WITH INCREASED INSOLENCE THE MEN MUTTERED AND CURSED THROWING BLACK LOOKS IN ITS DIRECTION
HE WAS A SLIGHTLY RAGGED MAN WHO SPAT SKILLFULLY BETWEEN HIS SHOES AND POSSESSED A GREAT FUND OF BLAND AND INFANTILE ASSURANCE THE YOUTH LIKED HIM PERSONALLY YANK THE OTHER HAD INFORMED HIM
BUT THEY WERE ALL DESTROYED BY THE VOICES OF EXHAUSTION AND PAIN FROM HIS BODY HIS AILMENTS CLAMORING FORCED HIM TO SEEK THE PLACE OF FOOD AND REST AT WHATEVER COST HE SWUNG UNSTEADILY TOWARD THE FIRE
HE SAID SEVERELY AFTER THE REPROOF THE YOUTH SAID NO MORE AN EXQUISITE DROWSINESS HAD SPREAD THROUGH HIM THE WARM COMFORT OF THE BLANKET ENVELOPED HIM AND MADE A GENTLE LANGOUR
BUT ALL HE KNEW WAS THAT IF HE FELL DOWN THOSE COMING BEHIND WOULD TREAD UPON HIM ALL HIS FACULTIES SEEMED TO BE NEEDED TO GUIDE HIM OVER AND PAST OBSTRUCTIONS HE FELT CARRIED ALONG BY A MOB
HE GAVE A LONG SIGH SNUGGLED DOWN INTO HIS BLANKET AND IN A MOMENT
THE CLANKING ARMS OF THE COLUMN NEAR HIM MADE HIM SOAR ON THE RED WINGS OF WAR FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS SUBLIME HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO START FOR THE FRONT INDEED HE SAW A PICTURE OF HIMSELF
YES YES
SOME BUILT COMPARATIVELY LARGE ONES WHILE OTHERS SEEMS CONTENT WITH LITTLE ONES THIS PROCEDURE CAUSED A DISCUSSION AMONG THE MEN SOME WISHED TO FIGHT LIKE DUELISTS BELIEVING IT TO BE CORRECT TO STAND ERECT AND BE
BEGAN THE LOUD SOLDIER WITH SCORN THE OTHER TURNED SAVAGELY UPON HIM THEY HAD A RAPID ALTERCATION IN WHICH THEY FASTENED UPON EACH OTHER VARIOUS STRANGE EPITHETS THE YOUTH AT LAST INTERRUPTED THEM DID YOU EVER THINK YOU MIGHT RUN YOURSELF JIM HE ASKED
SO THEY WERE AT LAST GOING TO FIGHT ON THE MORROW PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE A BATTLE AND HE WOULD BE IN IT FOR A TIME HE WAS OBLIGED TO LABOR TO MAKE HIMSELF BELIEVE
IT SEEMED THAT THE CANNON HAD COME FROM ALL PARTS AND WERE ENGAGED IN A STUPENDOUS WRANGLE IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A SENTENCE HEARD THE YOUTH WISHED TO LAUNCH A JOKE A QUOTATION FROM NEWSPAPERS HE DESIRED TO SAY
BUT THE REGIMENT WAS NOT YET VETERANLIKE IN APPEARANCE
BUT AS HE MORTALLY FEARED THESE SHAFTS IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO INVENT A TALE HE FELT HE COULD TRUST HE EXPERIMENTED WITH MANY SCHEMES BUT THREW THEM ASIDE ONE BY ONE AS FLIMSY
THE FIRE CACKLED MUSICALLY FROM IT SWELLED LIGHT SMOKE OVERHEAD THE FOLIAGE MOVED SOFTLY THE LEAVES WITH THEIR FACES TURNED TOWARD THE BLAZE WERE COLORED SHIFTING HUES OF SILVER
THEN AS IF THE HEADS WERE MOVED BY ONE MUSCLE ALL THE FACES WERE TURNED TOWARD HIM WITH WIDE DERISIVE GRINS HE SEEMED TO HEAR SOME ONE MAKE A HUMOROUS REMARK IN A LOW TONE AT IT THE OTHERS ALL CROWED AND CACKLED
HE HAD BURNED SEVERAL TIMES TO ENLIST TALES OF GREAT MOVEMENTS SHOOK THE LAND THEY MIGHT NOT BE DISTINCTLY HOMERIC BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE MUCH GLORY IN THEM HE HAD READ OF MARCHES SIEGES CONFLICTS
IT'S A LIE THAT'S ALL IT IS A THUNDERIN LIE SAID ANOTHER PRIVATE LOUDLY HIS SMOOTH FACE WAS FLUSHED
OR PERHAPS HE WOULD LIFT HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSTURE BLINK AT THE FIRE FOR AN UNINTELLIGENT MOMENT THROW A SWIFT GLANCE AT HIS PROSTRATE COMPANION
WHATEVER IT WAS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM HE SAID THERE LAY THE FAULT THE HASTE OF THE COLUMN TO REACH THE BATTLE SEEMED TO THE FORLORN YOUNG MAN TO BE SOMETHING MUCH FINER THAN STOUT FIGHTING HEROES HE THOUGHT
I KNOW I'M A BLACKSMITH AT TAKIN KEER A SICK FOLKS AN YEH NEVER SQUEAKED
THE MEN HAD BEGUN TO COUNT THE MILES UPON THEIR FINGERS AND THEY GREW TIRED SORE FEET AN DAMNED SHORT RATIONS THAT'S ALL SAID THE LOUD SOLDIER
PURLED AT THE ARMY'S FEET AND AT NIGHT WHEN THE STREAM HAD BECOME OF A SORROWFUL BLACKNESS ONE COULD SEE ACROSS IT THE RED EYELIKE GLEAM OF HOSTILE CAMP FIRES SET IN THE LOW BROWS OF DISTANT HILLS ONCE
THE YOUTH WISHED HIS FRIEND TO LEAN UPON HIM BUT THE OTHER ALWAYS SHOOK HIS HEAD AND STRANGELY PROTESTED NO NO NO LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE HIS LOOK WAS FIXED AGAIN UPON THE UNKNOWN
AS SHE CHANGED HER ATTITUDE HE OFTEN THOUGHT OF IT ON THE WAY TO WASHINGTON HIS SPIRIT HAD SOARED THE REGIMENT WAS FED AND CARESSED AT STATION AFTER STATION
WITH THE PASSIONATE SONG OF THE BULLETS AND THE BANSHEE SHRIEKS OF SHELLS WERE MINGLED LOUD CATCALLS AND BITS OF FACETIOUS ADVICE CONCERNING PLACES OF SAFETY
WITH SUDDEN LIVID RAGE TOWARD THE BATTLEFIELD HE SHOOK HIS FIST HE SEEMED ABOUT TO DELIVER A PHILIPPIC HELL THE RED SUN WAS PASTED IN THE SKY
THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER CAME SWINGING TWO CANTEENS BY THEIR LIGHT STRINGS WELL NOW HENRY OL BOY SAID THE LATTER WE'LL HAVE YEH FIXED UP IN JEST ABOUT A MINNIT HE HAD THE BUSTLING WAYS OF AN AMATEUR NURSE
WHICH HE THOUGHT COULD BE USED WITH TOUCHING EFFECT BUT HER WORDS DESTROYED HIS PLANS SHE HAD DOGGEDLY PEELED POTATOES AND ADDRESSED HIM AS FOLLOWS YOU WATCH OUT HENRY
THE ARMY AWAKENED AND BEGAN TO TREMBLE WITH EAGERNESS AT THE NOISE OF RUMORS IT CAST ITS EYES UPON THE ROADS WHICH WERE GROWING FROM LONG TROUGHS OF LIQUID MUD TO PROPER THOROUGHFARES
AND HE DID NOT CONCEIVE PUBLIC OPINION TO BE ACCURATE AT LONG RANGE IT WAS QUITE PROBABLE THEY WOULD HIT THE WRONG MAN WHO AFTER HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS AMAZEMENT WOULD PERHAPS SPEND THE REST OF HIS DAYS
I'VE HAD AN AWFUL TIME I'VE BEEN ALL OVER
THAT ALL OF THE UNTRIED MEN POSSESSED GREAT AND CORRECT CONFIDENCE HE NOW
WHEN HOWEVER THEY BEGAN TO PASS INTO A NEW REGION HIS OLD FEARS OF STUPIDITY AND INCOMPETENCE REASSAILED HIM BUT THIS TIME HE DOGGEDLY LET THEM BABBLE HE WAS OCCUPIED WITH HIS PROBLEM
DON'T WE DO ALL THAT MEN CAN DEMANDED THE YOUTH LOUDLY HE WAS SECRETLY DUMFOUNDED AT THIS SENTIMENT WHEN IT CAME FROM HIS LIPS FOR A MOMENT HIS FACE LOST ITS VALOR AND HE LOOKED GUILTILY ABOUT HIM
SAID THE LOUD ONE FROM A CORNER WELL REMARKED THE YOUTH LIKE AS NOT THIS STORY'LL TURN OUT
THE PHILOSOPHICAL TALL SOLDIER MEASURED A SANDWICH OF CRACKER AND PORK AND SWALLOWED IT IN A NONCHALANT MANNER
BADGERED BY DREAMS PERHAPS HE SWAYED WITH LITTLE BOUNCES AND STARTS LIKE AN OLD TODDY STRICKEN GRANDFATHER IN A CHIMNEY CORNER DUST AND STAINS WERE UPON HIS FACE
SPOKE OF TATTERED AND ETERNALLY HUNGRY MEN WHO FIRED DESPONDENT POWDERS THEY'LL CHARGE THROUGH HELL'S FIRE AN BRIMSTONE
HE WAS JEST MAD THAT'S WHAT HE WAS WHEN THAT FELLER TROD ON HIS HAND
SAID THE OTHER WITH COLD JUDGMENT
AND THE RARE WOUND AH HERE WE ARE HE SAID HE AWKWARDLY MADE FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS JEST AS I THOUGHT HE ADDED PRESENTLY YEH'VE BEEN GRAZED BY A BALL
ALL QUIET ON THE RAPPAHANNOCK BUT THE GUNS REFUSED TO PERMIT EVEN A COMMENT UPON THEIR UPROAR HE NEVER SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED THE SENTENCE BUT AT LAST THE GUNS STOPPED AND AMONG THE MEN IN THE RIFLE PITS RUMORS AGAIN FLEW
YEH'LL FELL THAT A NUMBER TEN HAT WOULDN'T FIT YEH AN YOUR HEAD'LL BE ALL HET UP AN FEEL AS DRY AS BURNT PORK
HE ADDED WITH A MIGHTY EMPHASIS ON THE LAST FOUR WORDS
I'VE THOUGHT IT MIGHT GET TOO HOT FOR JIM CONKLIN IN SOME OF THEM SCRIMMAGES AND IF A WHOLE LOT OF BOYS STARTED AND RUN
PRESENTLY THE ARMY AGAIN SAT DOWN TO THINK THE ODOR OF THE PEACEFUL PINES WAS IN THE MEN'S NOSTRILS
IF AN INTENSE SCENE HAD CAUGHT HIM WITH ITS WILD SWING AS HE CAME TO THE TOP OF THE BANK
HIDDEN MYSTERIOUS SOLEMN ONCE THE LINE ENCOUNTERED THE BODY OF A DEAD SOLDIER HE LAY UPON HIS BACK STARING AT THE SKY HE WAS DRESSED IN AN AWKWARD SUIT OF YELLOWISH BROWN
AND THEN WE BEGIN TO FIGHT AND THE REBS HAD AN EASY TIME OF IT DON'T TELL ME IT'S JUST LUCK I KNOW BETTER IT'S THIS DERNED OLD THE FRIEND SEEMED JADED BUT HE INTERRUPTED HIS COMRADE WITH A VOICE OF CALM CONFIDENCE
OH THEY'LL FIGHT ALL RIGHT I GUESS
FROM HIS HOME HIS YOUTHFUL EYES HAD LOOKED UPON THE WAR IN HIS OWN COUNTRY WITH DISTRUST IT MUST BE SOME SORT OF A PLAY AFFAIR HE HAD LONG DESPAIRED OF WITNESSING A GREEKLIKE STRUGGLE
THE OFFICER'S PROFANITY SOUNDED CONVENTIONAL IT RELIEVED THE TIGHTENED SENSES OF THE NEW MEN IT WAS AS IF HE HAD HIT HIS FINGERS WITH A TACK HAMMER AT HOME
HE WAS AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY HE SAW THAT HE WOULD AGAIN BE OBLIGED TO EXPERIMENT AS HE HAD IN EARLY YOUTH HE MUST ACCUMULATE INFORMATION OF HIMSELF AND MEANWHILE HE RESOLVED TO REMAIN CLOSE UPON HIS GUARD LEST THOSE QUALITIES
MEN EXTRICATED THEMSELVES FROM THICK SHIRTS PRESENTLY FEW CARRIED ANYTHING BUT THEIR NECESSARY CLOTHING BLANKETS HAVERSACKS CANTEENS AND ARMS AND AMMUNITION YOU CAN NOW EAT AND SHOOT
DIDN'T SAY I KNEW EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD
GOT CAREFULLY DOWN LIKE A CRONE STOOPING HE STRETCHED OUT WITH A MURMUR OF RELIEF AND COMFORT THE GROUND FELT LIKE THE SOFTEST COUCH
THERE WAS AN APPALLING IMPRINT UPON THESE FACES THE STRUGGLE IN THE SMOKE HAD PICTURED AN EXAGGERATION OF ITSELF ON THE BLEACHED CHEEKS AND IN THE EYES WILD WITH ONE DESIRE
OBJECTING TO NEITHER GAIT NOR DISTANCE
AND THEN BEFORE HE WAS ENTIRELY AWAKE HE FOUND HIMSELF RUNNING DOWN A WOOD ROAD IN THE MIDST OF MEN WHO WERE PANTING FROM THE FIRST EFFECTS OF SPEED HIS CANTEEN BANGED RYTHMICALLY UPON HIS THIGH AND HIS HAVERSACK BOBBED SOFTLY
THE YOUTH CONTEMPLATED HIS FRIEND WITH GRATEFUL EYES UPON HIS ACHING AND SWELLING HEAD THE COLD CLOTH WAS LIKE A TENDER WOMAN'S HAND YEH DON'T HOLLER NER SAY NOTHIN REMARKED HIS FRIEND APPROVINGLY
WHO WERE LYING DOWN BEHIND WHATEVER PROTECTION THEY HAD COLLECTED A BATTERY HAD TRUNDLED INTO POSITION IN THE REAR AND WAS THOUGHTFULLY SHELLING THE DISTANCE THE REGIMENT UNMOLESTED AS YET
SO'S I KIN DERN EM AN ALLUS BE CAREFUL AN CHOOSE YER COMP'NY THERE'S LOTS OF BAD MEN IN THE ARMY HENRY THE ARMY MAKES EM WILD AND THEY LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN THE JOB OF LEADING OFF A YOUNG FELLER LIKE YOU
THE SHOES DISPLAYED THE MUD OR DUST OF MARCHES AND BITS OF ROUNDED TROUSERS PROTRUDING FROM THE BLANKETS SHOWED RENTS AND TEARS FROM HURRIED PITCHINGS THROUGH THE DENSE BRAMBLES
IN THE MORNING THEY WERE ROUTED OUT WITH EARLY ENERGY AND HUSTLED ALONG A NARROW ROAD THAT LED DEEP INTO THE FOREST IT WAS DURING THIS RAPID MARCH THAT THE REGIMENT LOST MANY OF THE MARKS OF A NEW COMMAND
SOME TALKED OF GRAY BEWHISKERED HORDES WHO WERE ADVANCING WITH RELENTLESS CURSES AND CHEWING TOBACCO WITH UNSPEAKABLE VALOR TREMENDOUS BODIES OF FIERCE SOLDIERY WHO WERE SWEEPING ALONG LIKE THE HUNS OTHERS
AND WHILE HE BUILT A FIRE IN A GRASSY OPEN PLACE AMONGST THE TREES I FETCHED MEAL AND BACON AND COFFEE AND COFFEE POT AND FRYING PAN AND SUGAR AND TIN CUPS
BUT WE DIDN'T WEAR NO BOOTS AND DIDN'T YELL WE WAS IN THE PATH TO THE MILL AND WHEN THEY GOT PRETTY CLOSE ON TO US WE DODGED INTO THE BUSH
AND THE RATS WAS DOING WHAT THEY COULD TO KEEP OFF THE DULL TIMES FOR HER SO SHE TOOK AND DUSTED US BOTH WITH THE HICKRY AND WE WAS AS MUCH AS TWO HOURS CATCHING ANOTHER FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN
IT ALL BELONGED TO ME SO TO SAY AND I WANTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT BUT MAINLY I WANTED TO PUT IN THE TIME I FOUND PLENTY STRAWBERRIES RIPE AND PRIME AND GREEN SUMMER GRAPES AND GREEN RAZBERRIES AND THE GREEN BLACKBERRIES WAS JUST BEGINNING TO SHOW
IT WAS WHITE NOT LIKE ANOTHER MAN'S WHITE BUT A WHITE TO MAKE A BODY SICK A WHITE TO MAKE A BODY'S FLESH CRAWLA TREE TOAD WHITE A FISH BELLY WHITE
EVERYBODY THAT WANTS TO JOIN HAS GOT TO TAKE AN OATH AND WRITE HIS NAME IN BLOOD EVERYBODY WAS WILLING SO TOM GOT OUT A SHEET OF PAPER THAT HE HAD WROTE THE OATH ON AND READ IT IT SWORE EVERY BOY TO STICK TO THE BAND AND NEVER TELL ANY OF THE SECRETS
BUT THE REST WAS OUT OF PIRATE BOOKS AND ROBBER BOOKS AND EVERY GANG THAT WAS HIGH TONED HAD IT SOME THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KILL THE FAMILIES OF BOYS THAT TOLD THE SECRETS TOM SAID IT WAS A GOOD IDEA
AND WHEN HE WANTS TO SEND ANY LITTLE COMMON ORDINARY MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE TO LET THE WORLD KNOW WHERE HE'S CAPTIVATED
AND THE FRECKLED PLACES SWAPPED ABOUT A LITTLE SHOWING THERE WAS A LITTLE BREEZE UP THERE A COUPLE OF SQUIRRELS SET ON A LIMB AND JABBERED AT ME VERY FRIENDLY
AND HE CALLED THE TURNIPS AND STUFF JULERY
AND I SEE WE HADN'T NO TIME TO LOSE SO TOM SAID NOW FOR THE NONNAMOUS LETTERS WHAT'S THEM I SAYS WARNINGS TO THE PEOPLE THAT SOMETHING IS UP
AND CAMPED ON A PIECE OF A RAFT WE FOUND AND ABOUT MIDNIGHT HE MUST A KICKED HIS GUN IN HIS DREAMS FOR IT WENT OFF AND SHOT HIM IN THE LEG
I'LL MAKE HIM PUNGLE TOO OR I'LL KNOW THE REASON WHY SAY
AND ELEPHANTS AND TREASURE AND SO ON BUT WE HAD ENEMIES WHICH HE CALLED MAGICIANS AND THEY HAD TURNED THE WHOLE THING INTO AN INFANT SUNDAY SCHOOL JUST OUT OF SPITE I SAID ALL RIGHT THEN THE THING FOR US TO DO WAS TO GO FOR THE MAGICIANS
EVERYBODY SAID OH SHE'LL DO THAT'S ALL RIGHT HUCK CAN COME IN THEN THEY ALL STUCK A PIN IN THEIR FINGERS TO GET BLOOD TO SIGN WITH AND I MADE MY MARK ON THE PAPER NOW SAYS BEN ROGERS WHAT'S THE LINE OF BUSINESS OF THIS GANG
WHERE WAS HE WHY HE WAS IN THE DARK
AND SCOURED HER UP AND GOT HER IN GOOD SHAPE SHE WOULD START IN AND STRIKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BEFORE SHE GOT TUCKERED OUT
THEY HAD PICTURES HUNG ON THE WALLSMAINLY WASHINGTONS AND LAFAYETTES AND BATTLES AND HIGHLAND MARYS AND ONE CALLED SIGNING THE DECLARATION THERE WAS SOME THAT THEY CALLED CRAYONS
AND STARTED UP STAIRS VERY STEALTHY AND GOT UP TO THE MAIN FLOOR ALL RIGHT BUT HERE COMES AUNT SALLY WITH A CANDLE AND I CLAPPED THE TRUCK IN MY HAT
TOM SAYS WELL I TELL YOU WHAT I THINK
SAY DO WE KILL THE WOMEN TOO WELL BEN ROGERS IF I WAS AS IGNORANT AS YOU I WOULDN'T LET ON KILL THE WOMEN NO NOBODY EVER SAW ANYTHING IN THE BOOKS LIKE THAT YOU FETCH THEM TO THE CAVE
I NOTICED THE WINDOW WAS UP SO HE HAD CLUMB IN BY THE SHED HE KEPT A LOOKING ME ALL OVER
AND HE HOPED THE JUDGE WOULD HELP HIM AND NOT LOOK DOWN ON HIM THE JUDGE SAID HE COULD HUG HIM FOR THEM WORDS SO HE CRIED AND HIS WIFE SHE CRIED AGAIN
I RECKON THEY'D A GOT THE CORPSE THEY WAS AFTER WELL I SEE I WARN'T HURT THANKS TO GOODNESS THE BOAT FLOATED ON AND WENT OUT OF SIGHT AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE ISLAND I COULD HEAR THE BOOMING NOW AND THEN
SH D YOU HEAR A NOISE WE SKIPPED OUT AND LOOKED BUT IT WARN'T NOTHING BUT THE FLUTTER OF A STEAMBOAT'S WHEEL AWAY DOWN COMING AROUND THE POINT SO WE COME BACK YES SAYS I
SOMETIMES HE SPEC HE'LL GO WAY
I SAID IT WAS PRETTY BAD MONEY BUT MAYBE THE HAIR BALL WOULD TAKE IT BECAUSE MAYBE IT WOULDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE JIM SMELT IT AND BIT IT AND RUBBED IT AND SAID HE WOULD MANAGE SO THE HAIR BALL WOULD THINK IT WAS GOOD
HOW MUCH DO A KING GIT GET I SAYS
I'M FOR GOING AND GETTING IN THE CABIN FIRST AND RIGHT NOW AND CATCHING THEM WHEN THEY COME I MOST DROPPED
WELL THEN I SAYS IF WE DON'T WANT THE PICKS AND SHOVELS WHAT DO WE WANT A COUPLE OF CASE KNIVES TO DIG THE FOUNDATIONS OUT FROM UNDER THAT CABIN WITH YES
BUT YOU CAN GUESS CAN'T YOU IT'S JUST AS EASY WHICH CANDLE I SAYS
HE WON'T LAST YES HE WILL LAST TOO YOU DON'T RECKON IT'S GOING TO TAKE THIRTY SEVEN YEARS TO DIG OUT THROUGH A DIRT FOUNDATION DO YOU HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TOM WELL WE CAN'T RESK BEING AS LONG AS WE OUGHT TO
BY RIGHTS I RECKON WE OUGHT TO BE A COUPLE OF YEARS BUT WE CAN'T THINGS BEING SO UNCERTAIN WHAT I RECOMMEND IS THIS THAT WE REALLY DIG RIGHT IN AS QUICK AS WE CAN AND AFTER THAT WE CAN LET
AS SOON AS WE RECKONED EVERYBODY WAS ASLEEP THAT NIGHT WE WENT DOWN THE LIGHTNING ROD AND SHUT OURSELVES UP IN THE LEAN TO AND GOT OUT OUR PILE OF FOX FIRE AND WENT TO WORK
SAID WE'D GOT TO POST JIM FIRST THAT NIGHT WE WENT DOWN THE LIGHTNING ROD A LITTLE AFTER TEN AND TOOK ONE OF THE CANDLES ALONG AND LISTENED UNDER THE WINDOW HOLE AND HEARD JIM SNORING SO WE PITCHED IT IN AND IT DIDN'T WAKE HIM
MISS WATSON'S BIG NIGGER NAMED JIM WAS SETTING IN THE KITCHEN DOOR WE COULD SEE HIM PRETTY CLEAR BECAUSE THERE WAS A LIGHT BEHIND HIM HE GOT UP AND STRETCHED HIS NECK OUT ABOUT A MINUTE LISTENING THEN HE SAYS WHO DAH
BUT HAVE A CURSE PUT ON IT AND BE FORGOT FOREVER EVERYBODY SAID IT WAS A REAL BEAUTIFUL OATH AND ASKED TOM IF HE GOT IT OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD HE SAID SOME OF IT
BECAUSE IT MAYN'T TAKE VERY LONG FOR UNCLE SILAS TO HEAR FROM DOWN THERE BY NEW ORLEANS HE'LL HEAR JIM AIN'T FROM THERE THEN HIS NEXT MOVE WILL BE TO ADVERTISE JIM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO WE CAN'T RESK BEING AS LONG DIGGING HIM OUT AS WE OUGHT TO
AND I LAID INTO MY WORK AND WENT A BOOMING DOWN THE RIVER
AND TOWARDS SUNDOWN I STARTED MY CAMP FIRE AND HAD SUPPER THEN I SET OUT A LINE TO CATCH SOME FISH FOR BREAKFAST WHEN IT WAS DARK I SET BY MY CAMP FIRE SMOKING AND FEELING PRETTY WELL SATISFIED
WITH A RED AND BLUE SPREAD EAGLE PAINTED ON IT AND A PAINTED BORDER ALL AROUND IT COME ALL THE WAY FROM PHILADELPHIA THEY SAID THERE WAS SOME BOOKS TOO PILED UP PERFECTLY EXACT ON EACH CORNER OF THE TABLE ONE WAS A BIG FAMILY BIBLE
AND I SAID THESE KINDS OF THINGS WAS ADVENTURES BUT HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT NO MORE ADVENTURES HE SAID THAT WHEN I WENT IN THE TEXAS AND HE CRAWLED BACK TO GET ON THE RAFT AND FOUND HER GONE
SO HE COMES OUT AND JIM DON'T EITHER I RECKON BUT THERE'S ONE THING ANYWAY JIM'S TOO OLD TO BE DUG OUT WITH A CASE KNIFE
YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER'N YOUR FATHER NOW DON'T YOU BECAUSE HE CAN'T
DE SPUTE WAS BOUT A WHOLE CHILE EN DE MAN DAT THINK HE KIN SETTLE A SPUTE
I'LL KEEP A LOOKOUT AND IF ANY OF THEM'S FLOATING AROUND AFTER ME I'LL GIVE THEM A SHOW I CHANGED TO THE ILLINOIS EDGE OF THE ISLAND TO SEE WHAT LUCK I COULD HAVE AND I WARN'T DISAPPOINTED
SHE DISTURBED THE OLD MAN SO THAT HE SAID HE COULD MOST WISH THERE HADN'T EVER BEEN NO SNAKES CREATED WHY AFTER EVERY LAST SNAKE HAD BEEN GONE CLEAR OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR AS MUCH AS A WEEK AUNT SALLY WARN'T OVER IT YET SHE WARN'T NEAR OVER IT
AND BY AND BY THEY FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU AND NEVER WANT TO GO HOME ANY MORE
AND I BET YOU WON'T EVER BE A SLAVE NO MORE EN A MIGHTY GOOD JOB IT WUZ TOO HUCK
SO TOM WAS SATISFIED THEN HE SAYS NOW THE THING TO STUDY OUT IS HOW TO GET THE THINGS TO JIM TAKE THEM IN THROUGH THE HOLE I SAYS WHEN WE GET IT DONE HE ONLY JUST LOOKED SCORNFUL
AND WHIZZED ALONG AFTER THEM TILL WE WAS NEARLY TO THE MILL AND THEN STRUCK UP THROUGH THE BUSH TO WHERE MY CANOE WAS TIED AND HOPPED IN AND PULLED FOR DEAR LIFE TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER
THE SEEGARS WAS PRIME WE LAID OFF ALL THE AFTERNOON IN THE WOODS TALKING AND ME READING THE BOOKS AND HAVING A GENERAL GOOD TIME I TOLD JIM ALL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THE WRECK AND AT THE FERRYBOAT

HE SAID THAT IN THAT WAY IT COULD BE STRUNG OUT TO AS MUCH AS EIGHTY YEAR AND WOULD BE THE BEST TIME ON RECORD AND HE SAID IT WOULD MAKE US ALL CELEBRATED THAT HAD A HAND IN IT

CHAPTER THIRTY NINE IN THE MORNING WE WENT UP TO THE VILLAGE AND BOUGHT A WIRE RAT TRAP AND FETCHED IT DOWN AND UNSTOPPED THE BEST RAT HOLE AND IN ABOUT AN HOUR WE HAD FIFTEEN OF THE BULLIEST KIND OF ONES

AND IT WOULDN'T PASS NOHOW EVEN IF THE BRASS DIDN'T SHOW
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WE HAD KILLED AND MARKED BUT I COULDN'T SEE NO PROFIT IN IT ONE TIME TOM SENT A BOY TO RUN ABOUT TOWN WITH A BLAZING STICK
AND NOTHING WAS EVER SO LOVELY AS TO HEAR THE YOUNG LADIES SING THE LAST LINK IS BROKEN AND PLAY THE BATTLE OF PRAGUE ON IT THE WALLS OF ALL THE ROOMS WAS PLASTERED AND MOST HAD CARPETS ON THE FLOORS AND THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS WHITEWASHED ON THE OUTSIDE
AS I WENT BY I SEE IT WAS A LANTERN HANGING ON THE JACKSTAFF OF A DOUBLE HULL FERRYBOAT I SKIMMED AROUND FOR THE WATCHMAN A WONDERING WHEREABOUTS HE SLEPT AND BY AND BY I FOUND HIM ROOSTING ON THE BITTS FORWARD
LET SID FOOT IT HOME OR CANOE IT WHEN HE GOT DONE FOOLING AROUNDBUT
TILL HE HAD KILLED THEM AND HACKED A CROSS IN THEIR BREASTS WHICH WAS THE SIGN OF THE BAND
THERE WARN'T MUCH SAND IN MY CRAW BUT I SAYS THIS AIN'T NO TIME TO BE FOOLING AROUND
I PUT OUT MY PIPE AND WENT TO WHERE I FISHED OUT THE BREAD AND LAID DOWN BEHIND A LOG ON THE BANK IN A LITTLE OPEN PLACE WHERE THE LOG FORKED I COULD PEEP THROUGH
STEALTHY TOWARDS THE FENCE IN INJUN FILE AND GOT TO IT ALL RIGHT AND ME AND JIM OVER IT BUT TOM'S BRITCHES CATCHED FAST ON A SPLINTER ON THE TOP RAIL

JIM SAID BEES WOULDN'T STING IDIOTS BUT I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE I HAD TRIED THEM LOTS OF TIMES MYSELF AND THEY WOULDN'T STING ME I HAD HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS BEFORE BUT NOT ALL OF THEM
WE WENT ALONG A NARROW PLACE AND GOT INTO A KIND OF ROOM ALL DAMP AND SWEATY AND COLD AND THERE WE STOPPED TOM SAYS NOW WE'LL START THIS BAND OF ROBBERS AND CALL IT TOM SAWYER'S GANG
AND DID YOUNG STEPHEN DIE AND DID THE SAD HEARTS THICKEN AND DID THE MOURNERS CRY NO SUCH WAS NOT THE FATE OF YOUNG STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS THOUGH SAD HEARTS ROUND HIM THICKENED
A WHOLE MILE BROAD AND AWFUL STILL AND GRAND WE WENT DOWN THE HILL AND FOUND JO HARPER AND BEN ROGERS AND TWO OR THREE MORE OF THE BOYS
EVERY NOW AND THEN I STOPPED A SECOND AMONGST THE THICK LEAVES AND LISTENED BUT MY BREATH COME SO HARD I COULDN'T HEAR NOTHING ELSE I SLUNK ALONG ANOTHER PIECE FURTHER THEN LISTENED AGAIN AND SO ON AND SO ON
AND THEN MOSEY RIGHT DOWN THE LIGHTNING ROD AND COME ALONG I'LL GO AND STUFF THE STRAW INTO JIM'S CLOTHES TO REPRESENT HIS MOTHER IN DISGUISE AND BE READY TO BAA LIKE A SHEEP AND SHOVE
TOM SAID THAT WHAT HE MEANT WAS WE COULD STEAL ANYTHING WE NEEDED WELL I SAYS I NEEDED THE WATERMELON BUT HE SAID I DIDN'T NEED IT TO GET OUT OF PRISON WITH
AS I WAS A TELLING YOU
LIVE STOCKCATTLE YOU KNOW I PUT TEN DOLLARS IN A COW
AND KEEP A LIGHT BURNING SO HE COULD SEE IT AND THEN WHEN I WENT UP TO BED SHE COME UP WITH ME AND FETCHED HER CANDLE AND TUCKED ME IN
I WAS JUST TO THAT PASS I DIDN'T HAVE NO REASONING FACULTIES NO MORE IT LOOKS FOOLISH ENOUGH NOW IN THE DAYTIME BUT I SAYS TO MYSELF
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
WHY BLAME IT IT'S A RIDDLE DON'T YOU SEE SAY HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO STAY HERE YOU GOT TO STAY ALWAYS WE CAN JUST HAVE BOOMING TIMESTHEY DON'T HAVE NO SCHOOL NOW DO YOU OWN A DOG
SOMETIMES THE WIDOW WOULD TAKE ME ONE SIDE AND TALK ABOUT PROVIDENCE IN A WAY TO MAKE A BODY'S MOUTH WATER BUT MAYBE NEXT DAY MISS WATSON WOULD TAKE HOLD AND KNOCK IT ALL DOWN AGAIN I JUDGED
WAS WHERE I HAD LEFT IT
AND HE GOT SO HE WOULDN'T HARDLY NOTICE THE OTHER NIGGERS NIGGERS WOULD COME MILES TO HEAR JIM TELL ABOUT IT AND HE WAS MORE LOOKED UP TO THAN ANY NIGGER IN THAT COUNTRY STRANGE NIGGERS WOULD STAND WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN AND LOOK HIM ALL OVER SAME AS IF HE WAS A WONDER
SHE WAS A VISITING THERE AT BOOTH'S LANDING AND JUST IN THE EDGE OF THE EVENING SHE STARTED OVER WITH HER NIGGER WOMAN IN THE HORSE FERRY
BECAUSE THE FIRST HAUL WAS THE PICK OF THE FLOCK
WITHOUT PUTTING HIS HEAD OUT AND SAYS BE DONE BOYS WHO'S THERE I SAYS IT'S ME WHO'S ME GEORGE JACKSON SIR WHAT DO YOU WANT I DON'T WANT NOTHING SIR
HE HAD FORGOT ME AND EVERYTHING ELSE HE HAD HIS CHIN IN HIS HAND THINKING PRETTY SOON HE SIGHS AND SHAKES HIS HEAD THEN SIGHS AGAIN AND SAYS
I SEE I WAS MISTAKENTHAT IS AFTER THE FIRST JOLT
EN LET DE OLE MAN TAKE HIS OWN WAY DEY'S TWO ANGELS HOVERIN ROUN BOUT HIM ONE EM IS WHITE EN SHINY
AND I DON'T GIVE A DEAD RAT WHAT THE AUTHORITIES THINKS ABOUT IT NUTHER WELL HE SAYS THERE'S EXCUSE FOR PICKS AND LETTING ON IN A CASE LIKE THIS
HE SAYS WELL I'M PUZZLED IS SOMETHING THE MATTER PLEASE TAKE IT SAYS I AND DON'T ASK ME NOTHINGTHEN I WON'T HAVE TO TELL NO LIES HE STUDIED A WHILE AND THEN HE SAYS OHO O
YOU DON'T SEEM TO KNOW ANYTHING SOMEHOWPERFECT SAPHEAD I THOUGHT ALL THIS OVER FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND THEN I RECKONED I WOULD SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING IN IT
BUT ALL THE BOYS SAID IT WOULD BE WICKED TO DO IT ON SUNDAY AND THAT SETTLED THE THING THEY AGREED TO GET TOGETHER AND FIX A DAY AS SOON AS THEY COULD AND THEN WE ELECTED TOM SAWYER FIRST CAPTAIN AND JO HARPER SECOND CAPTAIN OF THE GANG AND SO STARTED HOME
BUT I TUCK TO SPECALAT'N EN GOT BUSTED OUT WHAT DID YOU SPECULATE IN JIM WELL FUST I TACKLED STOCK WHAT KIND OF STOCK WHY
JUST BY SAYING SOMETHING TO IT BUT HE NEVER TOLD WHAT IT WAS HE SAID TO IT NIGGERS WOULD COME FROM ALL AROUND THERE AND GIVE JIM ANYTHING THEY HAD
BECAUSE THEY WAS STILL ON THE PREMISES SOMEWHERES SO WE JUDGED WE COULD GET SOME OF THEM AGAIN NO
WAY UP STAIRS IN THAT LONESOME ROOM
SO THE VERY NEXT MORNING AT THE STREAK OF DAWN WE GOT ANOTHER LETTER READY AND WAS WONDERING WHAT WE BETTER DO WITH IT
FOR A CAT AND A COW TO TALK DIFFERENT FROM US
NO SIR I SAYS
THIS DEPTH WAS DOUBLED IN DECEMBER AND TREBLED IN JANUARY DURING THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY THE WORKMEN HAD TO CONTEND WITH A SHEET OF WATER WHICH MADE ITS WAY RIGHT ACROSS THE OUTER SOIL
J T MASTON BECAME THEIR CICERONE HE OMITTED NO POINT OF DETAIL HE CONDUCTED THEM THROUGHOUT THE MAGAZINES WORKSHOPS THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE ENGINES
THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND STATISTICAL SOCIETY OF NEW YORK THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY OF PHILADELPHIA AND THE SMITHSONIAN OF WASHINGTON SENT INNUMERABLE LETTERS OF CONGRATULATION TO THE GUN CLUB TOGETHER WITH OFFERS OF IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE AND MONEY
IT WOULD BE BUT JUST AND FAIR RETURNED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY
AS THOUGH SHE COMPREHENDED ALL THIS AGITATION REGARDING HERSELF THE MOON SHONE FORTH WITH SERENE SPLENDOR ECLIPSING BY HER INTENSE ILLUMINATION ALL THE SURROUNDING LIGHTS THE YANKEES ALL TURNED THEIR GAZE TOWARD HER RESPLENDENT ORB KISSED THEIR HANDS
AND ITS ATTRACTION WAS ENOUGH TO INFLUENCE OUR COURSE SO LITTLE CRIED NICHOLL
LET US ONLY ADMIT THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRIMORDIAL ATTRACTION AND THEN BY THE INEQUALITY OF THE TWO MOTIONS OF ROTATION AND REVOLUTION
ATTRACTED BY THE HIGH PAY AND CONSIDERABLE BOUNTIES OFFERED BY THE GUN CLUB HE HAD ENLISTED A CHOICE LEGION OF STOKERS IRON FOUNDERS LIME BURNERS MINERS BRICKMAKERS AND ARTISANS OF EVERY TRADE WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF COLOR
THE EXCITEMENT BEGAN TO SUBSIDE PRESIDENT BARBICANE REACHED HIS HOUSE BRUISED CRUSHED AND SQUEEZED ALMOST TO A MUMMY HERCULES COULD NOT HAVE RESISTED A SIMILAR OUTBREAK OF ENTHUSIASM THE CROWD GRADUALLY DESERTED THE SQUARES AND STREETS
A KIND OF CIRCLE STRONGLY BOLTED TOGETHER AND OF IMMENSE STRENGTH THE CENTER OF THIS WOODEN DISC WAS HOLLOWED OUT TO A DIAMETER EQUAL TO THE EXTERIOR DIAMETER OF THE COLUMBIAD UPON THIS WHEEL RESTED THE FIRST LAYERS OF THE MASONRY
THE WREATHS OF SMOKE SCATTERED THROUGH THE AIR TRACED AROUND STONES HILL A CIRCLE OF TERROR WHICH THE HERDS OF BUFFALOES AND THE WAR PARTIES OF THE SEMINOLES NEVER VENTURED TO PASS NEVERTHELESS THE WORKS ADVANCED REGULARLY
THE MEANS OF ARRIVING THITHER ARE SIMPLE EASY CERTAIN INFALLIBLE AND THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF MY PRESENT PROPOSAL A STORM OF ACCLAMATIONS GREETED THESE WORDS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE WHOLE AUDIENCE WHO WAS NOT OVERCOME CARRIED AWAY
MURCHISON WILL LAUNCH THE ELECTRIC SPARK ON THE WIRE WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHARGE OF THE COLUMBIAD AT THAT PRECISE MOMENT WE SHALL LEAVE OUR SPHEROID THUS WE STILL HAVE TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO REMAIN ON THE EARTH
COVERED THE LENTICULAR GLASSES AND THE TRAVELERS HERMETICALLY ENCLOSED IN THEIR METAL PRISON WERE PLUNGED IN PROFOUND DARKNESS AND NOW MY DEAR COMPANIONS SAID MICHEL ARDAN
NO SAID BARBICANE LET US STRETCH OURSELVES ON OUR SIDES WE SHALL RESIST THE SHOCK BETTER THAT WAY REMEMBER THAT WHEN THE PROJECTILE STARTS IT MATTERS LITTLE WHETHER WE ARE IN IT OR BEFORE IT
AND THE WORKS WERE COMMENCED IN MOST PERFECT ORDER THE NATURE OF THE SOIL HAVING BEEN CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY MEANS OF REPEATED BORINGS THE WORK OF EXCAVATION WAS FIXED FOR THE FOURTH OF NOVEMBER
EVERY INTELLIGENT BEING SAID THE GEOMETRICIAN MUST UNDERSTAND THE SCIENTIFIC MEANING OF THAT FIGURE THE SELENITES DO THEY EXIST
AND THIRTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE CORRESPONDING MEMBERS ONE CONDITION WAS IMPOSED
THEY MUST HAVE FLED TO THOSE UNFATHOMABLE CAVITIES WHICH THE EYE CANNOT REACH WHICH I CANNOT ADMIT FOR THEY MUST HAVE LEFT TRACES OF THEIR PASSAGE ON THOSE PLAINS WHICH THE ATMOSPHERE MUST COVER HOWEVER SLIGHTLY RAISED IT MAY BE
ASTONISH US SAID MICHEL ARDAN I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE MOON WAS INHABITED THE NIGHTS AND DAYS DID NOT LAST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AND WHY
BARBICANE QUICKLY PUT OUT THE GAS AND LAY DOWN BY HIS COMPANIONS AND THE PROFOUND SILENCE WAS ONLY BROKEN BY THE TICKING OF THE CHRONOMETER MARKING THE SECONDS
AUDACITY AND SANG FROID AT THIS MOMENT HE WAS SITTING IN HIS ARMCHAIR SILENT ABSORBED LOST IN REFLECTION SHELTERED UNDER HIS HIGH CROWNED HAT A KIND OF BLACK CYLINDER WHICH ALWAYS SEEMS FIRMLY SCREWED UPON THE HEAD OF AN AMERICAN
ANTECEDENTS OF THE GUN CLUB AND IT CANNOT FAIL TO MAKE SOME NOISE IN THE WORLD A THRILL OF EXCITEMENT RAN THROUGH THE MEETING BARBICANE HAVING BY A RAPID MOVEMENT FIRMLY FIXED HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD CALMLY CONTINUED HIS HARANGUE
CALLED HER BY ALL KINDS OF ENDEARING NAMES BETWEEN EIGHT O'CLOCK AND MIDNIGHT ONE OPTICIAN IN JONES' FALL STREET MADE HIS FORTUNE BY THE SALE OF OPERA GLASSES MIDNIGHT ARRIVED AND THE ENTHUSIASM SHOWED NO SIGNS OF DIMINUTION
HAVE WE NOT THE WATER CUSHIONS PLACED BETWEEN THE PARTITION BREAKS WHOSE ELASTICITY WILL SUFFICIENTLY PROTECT US I HOPE SO MICHEL REPLIED BARBICANE GENTLY BUT I AM NOT SURE
ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION RESIDENT IN BALTIMORE ATTENDED THE INVITATION OF THEIR PRESIDENT AS REGARDS THE CORRESPONDING MEMBERS NOTICES WERE DELIVERED BY HUNDREDS THROUGHOUT THE STREETS OF THE CITY AND LARGE AS WAS THE GREAT HALL
THIS FETE OF THE CASTING WILL BE A GRAND CEREMONY SAID J T MASTON TO HIS FRIEND BARBICANE UNDOUBTEDLY SAID BARBICANE BUT IT WILL NOT BE A PUBLIC FETE WHAT
MY FRIENDS REPLIED BARBICANE I DID NOT UNDERTAKE THIS JOURNEY IN ORDER TO FORM AN OPINION ON THE PAST HABITABILITY OF OUR SATELLITE BUT I WILL ADD THAT OUR PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS ONLY CONFIRM ME IN THIS OPINION
SELENOGRAPHIC CHARTS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH A PERFECTION WHICH EQUALS IF IT DOES NOT EVEN SURPASS THAT OF OUR TERRESTRIAL MAPS PHOTOGRAPHY HAS GIVEN US PROOFS OF THE INCOMPARABLE BEAUTY OF OUR SATELLITE ALL IS KNOWN REGARDING THE MOON
HANG A FEW OF OUR COUNTRYMEN NO SUCH LUCK REPLIED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY NOTHING OF THE KIND IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN AND EVEN IF IT DID WE SHOULD NOT PROFIT BY IT AMERICAN SUSCEPTIBILITY IS FAST DECLINING AND WE ARE ALL GOING TO THE DOGS
BUT SPEAK THEN MY CLUMSY SAVANT EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN FOR YOU MAKE ME BOIL WITH IMPATIENCE VERY WELL MY GOOD MICHEL REPLIED BARBICANE QUIETLY WE KNOW WHAT DIMINUTION OF TEMPERATURE THE EARTH UNDERGOES IN THE LAPSE OF A CENTURY
FROM THESE CONFLICTING INFLUENCES RESULTED A LINE WHICH MIGHT BECOME A TANGENT BUT IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THE PROJECTILE WOULD NOT FALL DIRECTLY ON THE MOON FOR ITS LOWER PART BY REASON OF ITS WEIGHT OUGHT TO BE TURNED TOWARD HER
TO BEAR UPON THE VERY RASHEST ENTERPRISES AN ESSENTIALLY NEW ENGLANDER
TO ATTEND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRESENT INVITATION VERY CORDIALLY IMPEY BARBICANE
AMONG THESE WAS THE BRISK BILSBY TOM HUNTER COLONEL BLOMSBERRY MAJOR ELPHINSTONE GENERAL MORGAN AND THE REST OF THE LOT TO WHOM THE CASTING OF THE COLUMBIAD
THIRTY SEVEN MINUTES SIX SECONDS PAST TEN IT IS UNDERSTOOD CAPTAIN WELL BEFORE ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR YOU WILL HAVE TO COUNT NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE PRESIDENT
STORED AT HIGH PRESSURE SUFFICED FOR THE LIGHTING AND WARMING OF THE PROJECTILE FOR A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR HOURS OR SIX DAYS AND SIX NIGHTS THE GAS CAUGHT FIRE
AND WHY ASKED NICHOLL BECAUSE IF YOU GAIN THE FIRST THE COLUMBIAD WILL HAVE BURST AND THE PROJECTILE WITH IT AND BARBICANE WILL NO LONGER BE THERE TO REIMBURSE YOUR DOLLARS MY STAKE IS DEPOSITED AT THE BANK IN BALTIMORE
THE PROJECTILE WAS RAPIDLY LEAVING THE MOON THE LINEAMENTS FADED AWAY FROM THE TRAVELERS EYES MOUNTAINS WERE CONFUSED IN THE DISTANCE AND OF ALL THE WONDERFUL STRANGE AND FANTASTICAL FORM OF THE EARTH'S SATELLITE THERE SOON REMAINED NOTHING
SEEING IN THAT TITLE AN ALLUSION DAMAGING TO BARBICANE'S PROJECT BROKE INTO THE AUDITORIUM SMASHED THE BENCHES AND COMPELLED THE UNLUCKY DIRECTOR TO ALTER HIS PLAYBILL
NO DIRECT COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH HER A VIOLENT MOVEMENT OF INTEREST AND SURPRISE HERE GREETED THIS REMARK OF THE SPEAKER PERMIT ME HE CONTINUED TO RECOUNT TO YOU BRIEFLY HOW CERTAIN ARDENT SPIRITS STARTING ON IMAGINARY JOURNEYS
I BELIEVE INDEED I AFFIRM THAT THE MOON HAS BEEN INHABITED BY A HUMAN RACE ORGANIZED LIKE OUR OWN THAT SHE HAS PRODUCED ANIMALS ANATOMICALLY FORMED LIKE THE TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS
MANY WORKMEN IT IS TRUE PAID WITH THEIR LIVES FOR THE RASHNESS INHERENT IN THESE DANGEROUS LABORS BUT THESE MISHAPS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE AVOIDED AND THEY ARE CLASSED AMONG THE DETAILS WITH WHICH THE AMERICANS TROUBLE THEMSELVES BUT LITTLE
FOR THE PRESENT WE MUST OCCUPY OURSELVES WITH OUR DEPARTURE ARE WE NOT READY DOUBTLESS BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN TO DEADEN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE FIRST SHOCK
THE NEW WORLD SEEMS TO HAVE MADE UP ITS MIND TO LIVE IN PEACE AND OUR BELLICOSE TRIBUNE PREDICTS SOME APPROACHING CATASTROPHES ARISING OUT OF THIS SCANDALOUS INCREASE OF POPULATION NEVERTHELESS REPLIED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY
THE WHEEL THEN SANK LITTLE BY LITTLE AND WITH IT THE MASSIVE RING OF MASONRY ON THE UPPER BED OF WHICH THE MASONS LABORED INCESSANTLY ALWAYS RESERVING SOME VENT HOLES TO PERMIT THE ESCAPE OF GAS DURING THE OPERATION OF THE CASTING
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN GRAVE QUESTIONS
WITH A LUMINOUS NETWORK WHAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THESE SPARKLING RAYS WHICH SHONE ON THE PLAINS AS WELL AS ON THE RELIEFS AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY MIGHT BE ALL STARTED FROM A COMMON CENTER THE CRATER
FROM THAT DAY FORWARD IMPEY BARBICANE BECAME ONE OF THE GREATEST CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES A KIND OF WASHINGTON OF SCIENCE A SINGLE TRAIT OF FEELING TAKEN FROM MANY OTHERS WILL SERVE TO SHOW THE POINT WHICH THIS HOMAGE OF A WHOLE PEOPLE
THE RESERVOIRS FILLED LITTLE BY LITTLE AND
THIS HOWEVER REQUIRED NOT LESS THAN SIXTY EIGHT VESSELS OF ONE THOUSAND TONS A VERITABLE FLEET WHICH QUITTING NEW YORK ON THE THIRD OF MAY ON THE TENTH OF THE SAME MONTH ASCENDED THE BAY OF ESPIRITU SANTO AND DISCHARGED THEIR CARGOES
THIS CHRONOMETER WAS SET WITHIN THE TENTH OF A SECOND BY THAT OF MURCHISON THE ENGINEER BARBICANE CONSULTED IT MY FRIENDS SAID HE IT IS TWENTY MINUTES PAST TEN AT FORTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST TEN
AGREED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT IS NOT THE MOON HABITABLE FOR CREATURES DIFFERENTLY ORGANIZED FROM OURSELVES
WILL YOU NOT OPEN THE GATES OF THE ENCLOSURE TO ALL COMERS I MUST BE VERY CAREFUL MASTON THE CASTING OF THE COLUMBIAD IS AN EXTREMELY DELICATE NOT TO SAY A DANGEROUS OPERATION
AS THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE WILL ONE DAY BECOME BY COOLING BY COOLING CERTAINLY REPLIED BARBICANE AS THE INTERNAL FIRES BECAME EXTINGUISHED
LIGHT LIKE HEAT CAN DIFFUSE ITSELF IN THE AIR HENCE AN EQUALITY BETWEEN THE INFLUENCES WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS NOW THAT ATMOSPHERE HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED AND NOW I AM GOING TO ASTONISH YOU
THE RETURN TO THE EARTH THE RETURN TO THE MOON OR STAGNATION ON THE NEUTRAL LINE AND HERE A FOURTH HYPOTHESIS BIG WITH ALL THE TERRORS OF THE INFINITE SURGED UP INOPPORTUNELY TO FACE IT WITHOUT FLINCHING
BUT THE POINT IN WHICH THE AMERICANS SINGULARLY DISTANCED THE EUROPEANS WAS IN THE SCIENCE OF GUNNERY NOT INDEED THAT THEIR WEAPONS RETAINED A HIGHER DEGREE OF PERFECTION THAN THEIRS
WERE PICTURESQUELY INTERLACED AGAINST THE WALLS THE GAS LIT UP IN FULL GLARE MYRIADS OF REVOLVERS GROUPED IN THE FORM OF LUSTRES WHILE GROUPS OF PISTOLS AND CANDELABRA FORMED OF MUSKETS BOUND TOGETHER
ALL THE HETEROGENEOUS UNITS WHICH MAKE UP THE POPULATION OF MARYLAND SHOUTED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE VERNACULARS AND THE VIVAS HURRAHS AND BRAVOS WERE INTERMINGLED IN INEXPRESSIBLE ENTHUSIASM JUST AT THIS CRISIS
THE INHABITANTS OF THE MOON IN SIXTEEN FORTY NINE A FRENCHMAN ONE JEAN BAUDOIN PUBLISHED A JOURNEY PERFORMED FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON BY DOMINGO GONZALEZ A SPANISH ADVENTURER AT THE SAME PERIOD
HIS EYE FIXED ON THE NEEDLE HIS FINGER ON THE ELECTRIC APPARATUS IS COUNTING THE SECONDS PREPARATORY TO LAUNCHING US INTO INTERPLANETARY SPACE ENOUGH MICHEL ENOUGH
AFTER HAVING DOUBTLESS REMAINED PERSISTENTLY FOR MILLIONS OF CENTURIES
SEEMED TO US TO MOVE ON THE MOON'S SURFACE
ASKED BARBICANE HUMPH SAID MICHEL ARDAN IT IS NOT EASY WE ARE IN THE TRAIN AND THE GUARD'S WHISTLE WILL SOUND BEFORE TWENTY FOUR MINUTES ARE OVER TWENTY SAID NICHOLL
BE BROUGHT DOWN TO ZERO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS EXCLAIMED MICHEL AH I BREATHE AGAIN REALLY I WAS FRIGHTENED TO HEAR YOU I IMAGINED THAT WE HAD NOT MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS TO LIVE
WOULD THEY DECIDE FOR OR AGAINST IT MICHEL ARDAN PERSUADED HIS TWO FRIENDS TO FORM AN OPINION AND ASKED THEM DIRECTLY IF THEY THOUGHT THAT MEN AND ANIMALS WERE REPRESENTED IN THE LUNAR WORLD
WHICH WAS ONLY TWO THOUSAND LEAGUES DISTANT THAT ITS SPEED WAS BECOMING UNIFORM FRESH PROOF THAT THERE WAS NO FALL ITS IMPULSIVE FORCE STILL PREVAILED OVER THE LUNAR ATTRACTION BUT THE PROJECTILE'S COURSE WAS CERTAINLY BRINGING IT NEARER TO THE MOON
THE WHEEL PARTLY GAVE WAY AND A SLIGHT PARTIAL SETTLEMENT ENSUED THIS ACCIDENT COST THE LIFE OF SEVERAL WORKMEN NO FRESH OCCURRENCE THENCEFORWARD ARRESTED THE PROGRESS OF THE OPERATION
CHAPTER THREE EFFECT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMUNICATION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY THE LAST WORDS OF THE HONORABLE PRESIDENT THE CRIES THE SHOUTS THE SUCCESSION OF ROARS HURRAHS AND ALL THE VARIED VOCIFERATIONS
WHEN THIS WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED THE MINERS RESUMED THEIR PICKS AND CUT AWAY THE ROCK FROM UNDERNEATH THE WHEEL ITSELF TAKING CARE TO SUPPORT IT AS THEY ADVANCED UPON BLOCKS OF GREAT THICKNESS AT EVERY TWO FEET WHICH THE HOLE GAINED IN DEPTH THEY SUCCESSIVELY WITHDREW THE BLOCKS
SAID BARBICANE THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I CALL PURELY PAPER ONES
AND THE IMPLACABLE ENEMY OF THE GENTLEMEN OF THE SOUTH THOSE ANCIENT CAVALIERS OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY
IT IS NOW HALF PAST THREE IN THE EVENING HALF PAST EIGHT OUGHT TO SEE US AT THE END OF OUR JOURNEY WHY DO WE NOT ARRIVE MIGHT IT NOT BE AN EXCESS OF SPEED ANSWERED NICHOLL FOR WE KNOW NOW THAT ITS INITIAL VELOCITY WAS GREATER THAN THEY SUPPOSED
AT THIS POINT THE EXCAVATION EXHIBITED A DEPTH OF SIX AND A HALF FEET
BY DAY THEY WORKED UNDER THE RAYS OF THE SCORCHING SUN BY NIGHT UNDER THE GLEAM OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THE SOUNDS OF THE PICKS AGAINST THE ROCK THE BURSTING OF MINES THE GRINDING OF THE MACHINES
THIS BOTTOM INCLINED AT AN ANGLE OF TWENTY FIVE DEGREES ALLOWED THE METAL TO FLOW INTO THE RECEIVING TROUGHS
THE CYCLOPEAN WORK HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY DURING THESE EIGHT MONTHS BARBICANE NEVER QUITTED STONES HILL FOR A SINGLE INSTANT
THERE ON THOSE VAST PLAINS THEY WERE TO DESCRIBE ENORMOUS GEOMETRIC FIGURES DRAWN IN CHARACTERS OF REFLECTING LUMINOSITY AMONG WHICH WAS THE PROPOSITION REGARDING THE SQUARE OF THE HYPOTHENUSE COMMONLY CALLED THE ASS'S BRIDGE BY THE FRENCH
THEY SPRANG FROM HIM HERSCHEL ATTRIBUTED THEIR BRILLIANCY TO CURRENTS OF LAVA CONGEALED BY THE COLD AN OPINION HOWEVER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN GENERALLY ADOPTED
BARBICANE HAD MADE A LARGE FORTUNE AS A TIMBER MERCHANT BEING NOMINATED DIRECTOR OF ARTILLERY DURING THE WAR
THREE THICK AND SOLIDLY MADE COUCHES HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE PROJECTILE NICHOLL AND BARBICANE PLACED THEM IN THE CENTER OF THE DISC FORMING THE FLOOR
AND I SHOULD PREFER ITS BEING DONE PRIVATELY AT THE DISCHARGE OF THE PROJECTILE A FETE IF YOU LIKE TILL THEN NO THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT THE OPERATION INVOLVED UNFORESEEN DANGERS
AND IN PARTICULAR THE WHITE DESCRIPTION THIS METAL IN FACT IS THE MOST TENACIOUS
THE CITY MAGNATES MUNICIPAL COUNCILORS AND SELECT MEN
CYRANO DE BERGERAC PUBLISHED THAT CELEBRATED
HIS OBJECT NOW WAS TO RAISE WITHIN THE CENTER OF THE WELL AND WITH A COINCIDENT AXIS A CYLINDER NINE HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND NINE FEET IN DIAMETER WHICH SHOULD EXACTLY FILL UP THE SPACE RESERVED FOR THE BORE OF THE COLUMBIAD
RELATIVELY THE ORGANIZING FORCE OF MATTER HAS BEEN MUCH MORE VIOLENT IN THE INTERIOR OF THE MOON THAN IN THE INTERIOR OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE THE ACTUAL STATE OF THIS CRACKED TWISTED AND BURST DISC ABUNDANTLY PROVES THIS
WHAT ARE YOU DREAMING OF SCREAMED BILSBY
THESE GIGANTIC FLAMES WORTHY OF A VOLCANO ITSELF
THEREFORE THAN TO PERCEIVE THEM APPLYING THEIR AUDACIOUS INGENUITY TO THE SCIENCE OF GUNNERY WITNESS THE MARVELS OF PARROTT DAHLGREN AND RODMAN THE ARMSTRONG PALLISER
EVERY PIECE EASY TO HANDLE AS THEIR WEIGHT WAS NOW SCARCELY FELT WAS QUICKLY MOUNTED THE DIFFERENT PIECES WERE FITTED WITHOUT TROUBLE IT BEING ONLY A MATTER OF BOLTS AND SCREWS
ON THAT EVENING A STRANGER WHO MIGHT HAVE CHANCED TO BE IN BALTIMORE COULD NOT HAVE GAINED ADMISSION FOR LOVE OR MONEY INTO THE GREAT HALL THAT WAS RESERVED EXCLUSIVELY FOR RESIDENT OR CORRESPONDING MEMBERS NO ONE ELSE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE OBTAINED A PLACE AND
DONKEYS AND CHICKENS I BET THAT WE SHALL FIND CHICKENS A HUNDRED DOLLARS WE SHALL FIND NONE SAID NICHOLL DONE MY CAPTAIN REPLIED ARDAN CLASPING NICHOLL'S HAND BUT BY THE BYE
ONE MIGHT SAY ALL THE WORLD WAS ON THE RAMPARTS THE PRESIDENT WAS SUFFICIENTLY WELL KNOWN HOWEVER FOR ALL TO BE ASSURED THAT HE WOULD NOT PUT HIS COLLEAGUES TO DISCOMFORT WITHOUT SOME VERY STRONG MOTIVE IMPEY BARBICANE WAS A MAN OF FORTY YEARS OF AGE
SO LONG BEFORE BEING FORWARDED TO TAMPA TOWN THE IRON ORE MOLTEN IN THE GREAT FURNACES OF COLDSPRING
IT SPREAD EQUALLY AMONG ALL CLASSES OF CITIZENS MEN OF SCIENCE SHOPKEEPERS MERCHANTS PORTERS CHAIR MEN AS WELL AS GREENHORNS WERE STIRRED IN THEIR INNERMOST FIBRES A NATIONAL ENTERPRISE WAS AT STAKE THE WHOLE CITY
WITHOUT DUES IN THE PORT AT TAMPA TOWN THENCE THE IRON WAS TRANSPORTED BY RAIL TO STONES HILL AND ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY THIS ENORMOUS MASS OF METAL WAS DELIVERED AT ITS DESTINATION
THEY ARE ALWAYS STRUGGLING IN EUROPE TO MAINTAIN THE PRINCIPLE OF NATIONALITIES WELL
IT WAS IN REALITY A FALL OF EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX LEAGUES ON AN ORB IT IS TRUE WHERE WEIGHT COULD ONLY BE RECKONED AT ONE SIXTH OF TERRESTRIAL WEIGHT A FORMIDABLE FALL NEVERTHELESS
IS THE CONVICTION THAT WE ARE SAFE TO SUCCEED IN AN ENTERPRISE WHICH TO ANY OTHER COUNTRY WOULD APPEAR WHOLLY IMPRACTICABLE THIS PROJECT THE RESULT OF LONG ELABORATION IS THE OBJECT OF MY PRESENT COMMUNICATION IT IS WORTHY OF YOURSELVES
THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY'S NOTE SAYS THAT THE TRANSIT OUGHT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN NINETY SEVEN HOURS THIRTEEN MINUTES AND TWENTY SECONDS WHICH MEANS TO SAY THAT SOONER THE MOON WILL NOT BE AT THE POINT INDICATED AND LATER IT WILL HAVE PASSED IT TRUE
HERE IT IS CONTINUED BARBICANE THE PROBLEM IS A DOUBLE ONE AND REQUIRES A DOUBLE SOLUTION IS THE MOON HABITABLE HAS THE MOON EVER BEEN INHABITABLE GOOD
WHAT SAID MICHEL ARDAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN EXCLAIMED NICHOLL I MEAN
SINCE WE ARE BEING BORNE ALONG IN SPACE WE SHALL END BY FALLING INTO SOME CENTER OF ATTRACTION OR OTHER MICHEL ARDAN'S INDIFFERENCE DID NOT CONTENT BARBICANE NOT THAT HE WAS UNEASY ABOUT THE FUTURE
DO YOU SAY TO YOURSELF THIS PRISON MAY BE OUR TOMB TOMB PERHAPS STILL I WOULD NOT CHANGE IT FOR MAHOMET'S WHICH FLOATS IN SPACE BUT NEVER ADVANCES AN INCH
EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN THAT THE MOON DID NOT EXIST BEFORE THE EARTH THEIR IMAGINATIONS CARRIED THEM AWAY INTO AN INDEFINITE FIELD OF HYPOTHESIS BARBICANE SOUGHT TO RESTRAIN THEM
BUT THAT THEY EXHIBITED UNHEARD OF DIMENSIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY ATTAINED HITHERTO UNHEARD OF RANGES IN POINT OF GRAZING PLUNGING OBLIQUE OR ENFILADING OR POINT BLANK FIRING THE ENGLISH
THE CONSEQUENCES OF A DEVIATION BARBICANE HAD NOW NO FEAR OF THE ISSUE OF THE JOURNEY AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE PROJECTILE'S IMPULSIVE FORCE WAS CONCERNED ITS OWN SPEED WOULD CARRY IT BEYOND THE NEUTRAL LINE
FOR SOME MOMENTS THE THREE TRAVELERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER THEN THEY BEGAN TO EXAMINE THE OBJECTS IMPRISONED WITH THEM EVERYTHING IS IN ITS PLACE SAID BARBICANE
AND THEY MIGHT HOPE THAT AT A NEARER POINT THE WEIGHT PREDOMINATING WOULD CAUSE A DECIDED FALL THE THREE FRIENDS HAVING NOTHING BETTER TO DO CONTINUED THEIR OBSERVATIONS BUT THEY COULD NOT YET DETERMINE THE TOPOGRAPHICAL POSITION OF THE SATELLITE
THE MEETING FELT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOW APPROACHING THE CRITICAL POINT AND REDOUBLED THEIR ATTENTION ACCORDINGLY FOR SOME MONTHS PAST MY BRAVE COLLEAGUES CONTINUED BARBICANE I HAVE BEEN ASKING MYSELF WHETHER WHILE CONFINING OURSELVES TO OUR OWN PARTICULAR OBJECTS
A QUANTITY FAR TOO COSTLY TO SEND BY RAILWAY THE COST OF TRANSPORT WOULD HAVE BEEN DOUBLE THAT OF MATERIAL IT APPEARED PREFERABLE TO FREIGHT VESSELS AT NEW YORK AND TO LOAD THEM WITH THE IRON IN BARS
A CIRCULAR HOLE SIXTY FEET IN DIAMETER THE PICKAXE FIRST STRUCK UPON A KIND OF BLACK EARTH SIX INCHES IN THICKNESS WHICH WAS SPEEDILY DISPOSED OF TO THIS EARTH SUCCEEDED TWO FEET OF FINE SAND
HAPPILY BARBICANE NOT CONTENT WITH EMPLOYING WATER HAD FURNISHED THE MOVABLE DISC WITH STRONG SPRING PLUGS DESTINED TO LESSEN THE SHOCK AGAINST THE BASE AFTER THE BREAKING OF THE HORIZONTAL PARTITIONS THESE PLUGS STILL EXISTED
BUT TO HIS ANNOYANCE IT HAD NOT TURNED OVER SUFFICIENTLY FOR ITS FALL IT SEEMED TO TAKE A CURVE PARALLEL TO THE LUNAR DISC THE ORB OF NIGHT SHONE SPLENDIDLY INTO SPACE WHILE OPPOSITE THE ORB OF DAY BLAZED WITH FIRE
BESIDES EVEN WITHOUT THESE CONDITIONS LIFE WAS POSSIBLE AND SO ASKED MICHEL ARDAN HUMANITY HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE MOON YES REPLIED BARBICANE
AFTER THE CASTINGS THESE WOULD BE BURIED IN THE BLOCK OF METAL LEAVING NO EXTERNAL PROJECTION THIS OPERATION WAS COMPLETED ON THE EIGHTH OF JULY AND THE RUN OF THE METAL WAS FIXED FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY
WELL REPLIED BARBICANE SMILING AND WHAT HAND WOULD BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO THROW A BALL TO GIVE SUCH A SHOCK AS THAT THE HAND IS NOT NECESSARY ANSWERED NICHOLL NOT AT ALL CONFOUNDED
AS MANY POUNDS OF METAL AS THERE WERE TO CAST SO MANY POUNDS OF COAL WERE THERE TO BURN THUS THERE WERE SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND TONS OF COAL WHICH PROJECTED IN THE FACE OF THE SUN A THICK CURTAIN OF SMOKE
AND MURCHISON THE ENGINEER RE EMBARKED ON BOARD THE TAMPICO FOR NEW ORLEANS HIS OBJECT WAS TO ENLIST AN ARMY OF WORKMEN AND TO COLLECT TOGETHER THE GREATER PART OF THE MATERIALS
THESE ROCKETS WERE TO BURN IN SPACE IT IS TRUE BUT OXYGEN WOULD NOT FAIL THEM FOR THEY COULD SUPPLY THEMSELVES WITH IT LIKE THE LUNAR VOLCANOES THE BURNING OF WHICH HAS NEVER YET BEEN STOPPED BY THE WANT OF ATMOSPHERE ROUND THE MOON
BECAUSE THE REGULARITY OF THESE LUMINOUS LINES AND THE VIOLENCE NECESSARY TO CARRY VOLCANIC MATTER TO SUCH DISTANCES IS INEXPLICABLE
THE SHOCK WHICH PRODUCED THAT RENT
YOU SMILE BARBICANE
AND ONE MAY IMAGINE THE ACTIVITY WHICH PERVADED THAT LITTLE TOWN WHOSE POPULATION WAS THUS DOUBLED IN A SINGLE DAY DURING THE FIRST FEW DAYS THEY WERE BUSY DISCHARGING THE CARGO BROUGHT BY THE FLOTILLA THE MACHINES AND THE RATIONS
HEATED TO A HIGH TEMPERATURE WAS CARBURIZED AND TRANSFORMED INTO CAST IRON AFTER THIS FIRST OPERATION THE METAL WAS SENT ON TO STONES HILL THEY HAD HOWEVER
THIS CYLINDER WAS COMPOSED OF A MIXTURE OF CLAY AND SAND WITH THE ADDITION OF A LITTLE HAY AND STRAW THE SPACE LEFT BETWEEN THE MOULD AND THE MASONRY WAS INTENDED TO BE FILLED UP BY THE MOLTEN METAL
CHATTING WITH HIS FRIENDS SPEAKING TO THE DOGS DIANA AND SATELLITE TO WHOM AS MAY BE SEEN HE HAD GIVEN SIGNIFICANT NAMES AH DIANA AH SATELLITE
AND ON THE TENTH OF JUNE TWENTY DAYS BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE PERIOD FIXED BY BARBICANE THE WELL LINED THROUGHOUT WITH ITS FACING OF STONE HAD ATTAINED THE DEPTH OF NINE HUNDRED FEET
THUS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE TRAVELERS TO OBSERVE THE MOON FROM THAT OPENING WHILE THEY WERE BEING PRECIPITATED PERPENDICULARLY UPON HER BUT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP EVEN BY THE SIDE OPENINGS THEY COULD STILL SEE VAST LUNAR REGIONS
BUT WATER FAILED FOR THEY COULD NOT USE THEIR RESERVE WHICH WAS PRECIOUS IN CASE DURING THE FIRST DAYS THE LIQUID ELEMENT SHOULD BE FOUND WANTING ON LUNAR SOIL AND INDEED THIS RESERVE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE INSUFFICIENT FOR A SPRING
BOLD IN HIS CONCEPTIONS HE CONTRIBUTED POWERFULLY TO THE PROGRESS OF THAT ARM AND GAVE AN IMMENSE IMPETUS TO EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES HE WAS PERSONAGE OF THE MIDDLE HEIGHT
MICHEL REPLIED THAT HE WOULD BREAK THEIR FALL BY MEANS OF ROCKETS PROPERLY PLACED THUS POWERFUL FIREWORKS TAKING THEIR STARTING POINT FROM THE BASE AND BURSTING OUTSIDE COULD BY PRODUCING A RECOIL CHECK TO A CERTAIN DEGREE THE PROJECTILE'S SPEED
A CONTRACTION SOMETHING LIKE A LUNAR STOMACH ACHE SAID MICHEL ARDAN BESIDES ADDED BARBICANE THIS OPINION IS THAT OF AN ENGLISH SAVANT
EVERY RELIEF WAS LEVELED UNDER THE REFLECTION OF THE SOLAR RAYS THEY WATCHED THUS THROUGH THE SIDE WINDOWS UNTIL EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT THE MOON HAD GROWN SO LARGE IN THEIR EYES THAT IT FILLED HALF OF THE FIRMAMENT THE SUN ON ONE SIDE AND THE ORB OF NIGHT ON THE OTHER
ON THAT DAY BARBICANE CALLED TOGETHER HIS FOREMEN AND ADDRESSED THEM AS FOLLOWS YOU ARE WELL AWARE MY FRIENDS OF THE OBJECT WITH WHICH I HAVE ASSEMBLED YOU TOGETHER IN THIS WILD PART OF FLORIDA
AFTER THIS CONVERSATION EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION RECEIVED A SEALED CIRCULAR COUCHED IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS BALTIMORE OCTOBER THIRD THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB HAS THE HONOR TO INFORM HIS COLLEAGUES
THE INVENTOR OF A NEW CANNON ASSOCIATED HIMSELF WITH THE CASTER AND THE BORER THUS WAS FORMED THE NUCLEUS OF THE GUN CLUB IN A SINGLE MONTH AFTER ITS FORMATION IT NUMBERED ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THREE EFFECTIVE MEMBERS
TO DEADEN THE SHOCK IT WAS A PITY THAT BARBICANE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO EMPLOY THE MEANS WHICH HAD SO ABLY WEAKENED THE SHOCK AT DEPARTURE THAT IS TO SAY BY WATER USED AS SPRINGS AND THE PARTITION BREAKS THE PARTITIONS STILL EXISTED
IT IS BUT FAIR TO ADD THAT THESE YANKEES BRAVE AS THEY HAVE EVER PROVED THEMSELVES TO BE DID NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THEORIES AND FORMULAE BUT THAT THEY PAID HEAVILY IN PROPRIA PERSONA FOR THEIR INVENTIONS AMONG THEM
BY THE AID OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY EIGHT DAYS AFTER ITS DEPARTURE THE TAMPICO RETURNED INTO THE BAY OF ESPIRITU SANTO WITH A WHOLE FLOTILLA OF STEAMBOATS MURCHISON HAD SUCCEEDED IN ASSEMBLING TOGETHER FIFTEEN HUNDRED ARTISANS
THERE WERE TWENTY OF THEM AN OPENING LEFT IN THE DISC ALLOWED THEM TO LIGHT THE MATCH WITH WHICH EACH WAS PROVIDED ALL THE EFFECT WAS FELT OUTSIDE THE BURNING MIXTURE HAD ALREADY BEEN RAMMED INTO EACH GUN
AND A CRANE LET THEM DOWN TO THE CONICAL TOP OF THE PROJECTILE THERE AN OPENING MADE FOR THE PURPOSE GAVE THEM ACCESS TO THE ALUMINUM CAR THE TACKLE BELONGING TO THE CRANE BEING HAULED FROM OUTSIDE
WE MIGHT WELL ASK OURSELVES OF WHAT MATERIALS ARE THE HEARTS OF THESE AMERICANS MADE TO WHOM THE APPROACH OF THE MOST FRIGHTFUL DANGER ADDED NO PULSATION
IN FRONT OF THE TABLE BENCHES ARRANGED IN ZIGZAG FORM LIKE THE CIRCUMVALLATIONS OF A RETRENCHMENT FORMED A SUCCESSION OF BASTIONS AND CURTAINS
NICHOLL ONCE INTRODUCED WITH HIS COMPANIONS INSIDE THE PROJECTILE BEGAN TO CLOSE THE OPENING BY MEANS OF A STRONG PLATE HELD IN POSITION BY POWERFUL SCREWS OTHER PLATES CLOSELY FITTED
BARBICANE'S UNEASINESS INCREASED AS HE SAW HIS PROJECTILE RESIST THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITATION THE UNKNOWN WAS OPENING BEFORE HIM THE UNKNOWN IN INTERPLANETARY SPACE THE MAN OF SCIENCE THOUGHT HE HAD FORESEEN THE ONLY THREE HYPOTHESES POSSIBLE
CHAPTER TWO PRESIDENT BARBICANE'S COMMUNICATION ON THE FIFTH OF OCTOBER AT EIGHT P M A DENSE CROWD PRESSED TOWARD THE SALOONS OF THE GUN CLUB
THAT WOULD BE BETTER THAN DOING NOTHING HERE RETURNED THE COLONEL QUITE SO SAID J T MATSON BUT STILL WE NEED NOT DREAM OF THAT EXPEDIENT AND WHY NOT DEMANDED THE COLONEL BECAUSE THEIR IDEAS OF PROGRESS
BUT THE PROJECTILE WAS PERCEPTIBLY NEARING THE MOON AND EVIDENTLY SUCCUMBED TO HER INFLUENCE TO A CERTAIN DEGREE
THEY WERE ALL BUILT AFTER THE MODEL OF THOSE WHICH SERVED FOR THE CASTING OF THE RODMAN GUN THEY WERE TRAPEZOIDAL IN SHAPE WITH A HIGH ELLIPTICAL ARCH THESE FURNACES CONSTRUCTED OF FIREPROOF BRICK
HE BUSIED HIMSELF INCESSANTLY WITH THE WELFARE AND HEALTH OF HIS WORKPEOPLE AND WAS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE IN WARDING OFF THE EPIDEMICS COMMON TO LARGE COMMUNITIES OF MEN AND SO DISASTROUS IN THOSE REGIONS OF THE GLOBE WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO THE INFLUENCES OF TROPICAL CLIMATES
OF ITS TIME ABOUT EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE A SMALL TREATISE TRANSLATED FROM THE NEW YORK AMERICAN RELATED HOW SIR JOHN HERSCHEL HAVING BEEN DESPATCHED TO THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING THERE SOME ASTRONOMICAL CALCULATIONS
BARBICANE HAD ACCORDINGLY SUPPLIED HIMSELF WITH THESE FIREWORKS ENCLOSED IN LITTLE STEEL GUNS WHICH COULD BE SCREWED ON TO THE BASE OF THE PROJECTILE INSIDE THESE GUNS WERE FLUSH WITH THE BOTTOM OUTSIDE THEY PROTRUDED ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES
HIGH AND LOW THE QUAYS BORDERING THE PATAPSCO THE SHIPS LYING IN THE BASINS DISGORGED A CROWD DRUNK WITH JOY GIN AND WHISKY EVERY ONE CHATTERED ARGUED DISCUSSED DISPUTED APPLAUDED
DO YOU WISH TO KNOW MY OPINION ON THE SUBJECT OF FINDING OUT THIS DEVIATION SPEAK I WOULD NOT GIVE HALF A DOLLAR TO KNOW IT THAT WE HAVE DEVIATED IS A FACT WHERE WE ARE GOING MATTERS LITTLE WE SHALL SOON SEE
WERE TO BE COUNTED OFFICERS OF ALL RANKS FROM LIEUTENANTS TO GENERALS MILITARY MEN OF EVERY AGE FROM THOSE WHO WERE JUST MAKING THEIR DEBUT IN THE PROFESSION OF ARMS UP TO THOSE WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN THE GUN CARRIAGE MANY HAD FOUND
THEN THE IRON OF THE PICKS STRUCK UPON THE HARD BED OF THE SOIL A KIND OF ROCK FORMED OF PETRIFIED SHELLS VERY DRY VERY SOLID AND WHICH THE PICKS COULD WITH DIFFICULTY PENETRATE
THE STONES OF WHICH WERE BOUND TOGETHER BY HYDRAULIC CEMENT WITH IRRESISTIBLE TENACITY
SAID BARBICANE IN A SERIOUS VOICE LET US PREPARE
SEPARATELY PIECED AND NUMBERED AT THE SAME PERIOD BARBICANE LAID THE FIRST SLEEPERS OF A RAILWAY FIFTEEN MILES IN LENGTH INTENDED TO UNITE STONES HILL WITH TAMPA TOWN ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER BARBICANE QUITTED TAMPA TOWN WITH A DETACHMENT OF WORKMEN
THAT IF IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE MOON ITS LONG NIGHTS AND LONG DAYS CREATED DIFFERENCES OF TEMPERATURE INSUPPORTABLE TO ORGANIZATION IT WAS NOT SO AT THE HISTORICAL PERIOD OF TIME THE ATMOSPHERE ENVELOPED THE DISC WITH A FLUID MANTLE
FOR EXAMPLE ITS DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AT THE TERRESTRIAL POLES THEY LAST SIX MONTHS SAID MICHEL AN ARGUMENT OF LITTLE VALUE SINCE THE POLES ARE NOT INHABITED LET US OBSERVE MY FRIENDS CONTINUED BARBICANE
TWELVE O'CLOCK STRUCK A GUNSHOT SUDDENLY PEALED FORTH AND SHOT ITS FLAME INTO THE AIR TWELVE HUNDRED MELTING TROUGHS WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY OPENED AND TWELVE HUNDRED FIERY SERPENTS CREPT TOWARD THE CENTRAL WELL
EVERY ONE MUST SEE THAT THAT INVOLVED THE COMMENCEMENT OF A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS ALL MUST HOPE THAT SOME DAY AMERICA
THE MOON AND THE EARTH WERE NOTHING BUT GASEOUS MASSES ORIGINALLY
CONTINUED BARBICANE AN ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDED IT
PERCHED ON A NEIGHBORING EMINENCE ASSISTED AT THE OPERATION IN FRONT OF THEM WAS A PIECE OF ARTILLERY READY TO GIVE FIRE ON THE SIGNAL FROM THE ENGINEER SOME MINUTES BEFORE MIDDAY THE FIRST DRIBLETS OF METAL BEGAN TO FLOW
REPLIED BARBICANE SIMPLY AND IF NICHOLL IS NOT THERE IT WILL GO TO HIS HEIRS AH YOU PRACTICAL MEN EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN I ADMIRE YOU THE MORE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND YOU
THESE REVERBERATIONS RIVALING THOSE OF HURRICANES AND STORMS
AS AN AERONAUT SEES THE EARTH FROM HIS CAR THIS REPLACING OF THE DISC WAS AT LEAST AN HOUR'S WORK IT WAS PAST TWELVE WHEN ALL PREPARATIONS WERE FINISHED BARBICANE TOOK FRESH OBSERVATIONS ON THE INCLINATION OF THE PROJECTILE
REPLIED NICHOLL FIRST LET US SEE WHETHER THE MOON IS HABITABLE TO TELL THE TRUTH I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT ANSWERED MICHEL AND I ANSWER IN THE NEGATIVE CONTINUED BARBICANE
LIFTED OUT OF HIMSELF BY THE SPEAKER'S WORDS LONG CONTINUED APPLAUSE RESOUNDED FROM ALL SIDES AS SOON AS THE EXCITEMENT HAD PARTIALLY SUBSIDED BARBICANE RESUMED HIS SPEECH IN A SOMEWHAT GRAVER VOICE YOU KNOW SAID HE
ONE AFTER THE OTHER AT THE END OF THE TWELVE HUNDREDTH VISIT THEY WERE PRETTY WELL KNOCKED UP THE CASTING WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT TWELVE O'CLOCK PRECISELY THE PREVIOUS EVENING EACH FURNACE HAD BEEN CHARGED
BARBICANE AND NICHOLL COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THEIR COMPANION'S UNEASINESS
PROBABLY WITHDRAWN BY TERRESTRIAL ATTRACTION THEN AERIAL DEPARTURE OF RESPIRABLE AIR AND DISAPPEARANCE OF WATER BY MEANS OF EVAPORATION AT THIS PERIOD THE MOON BECOMING UNINHABITABLE WAS NO LONGER INHABITED IT WAS A DEAD WORLD
I THINK THAT WE CAN ANSWER SAID BARBICANE BUT ACCORDING TO MY IDEA THE QUESTION OUGHT NOT TO BE PUT IN THAT FORM I ASK IT TO BE PUT DIFFERENTLY PUT IT YOUR OWN WAY REPLIED MICHEL
HER MASS DENSITY AND WEIGHT HER CONSTITUTION MOTIONS DISTANCE
WHICH A GREAT INFLUX OF SPECTATORS WOULD HAVE HINDERED HIM FROM AVERTING IT WAS NECESSARY TO PRESERVE COMPLETE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT NO ONE WAS ADMITTED WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE EXCEPT A DELEGATION OF MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB WHO HAD MADE THE VOYAGE TO TAMPA TOWN
FOUR THOUSAND BECAUSE THE COLUMBIAD WILL NOT BURST AND FIVE THOUSAND BECAUSE THE PROJECTILE WILL RISE MORE THAN SIX MILES IN THE AIR
AFTER A PERIOD OF YEARS FULL OF INCIDENTS WE HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON OUR LABORS AND TO STOP SHORT ON THE ROAD OF PROGRESS I DO NOT HESITATE TO STATE BALDLY THAT ANY WAR WHICH WOULD RECALL US TO ARMS WOULD BE WELCOME TREMENDOUS APPLAUSE
AND WHEN THE ASSEMBLY CLOSED PARTED ON THE LADY'S SIDE AT LEAST WITH A STRONG INCLINATION FOR CONTINUING THE ACQUAINTANCE
AND FEW AND TRIVIAL WERE THE SENTENCES EXCHANGED WHILE THEY REMAINED UPSTAIRS CATHERINE IN BUSY AGITATION COMPLETING HER DRESS AND ELEANOR WITH MORE GOODWILL THAN EXPERIENCE INTENT UPON FILLING THE TRUNK WHEN EVERYTHING WAS DONE THEY LEFT THE ROOM
MY BROTHER DOES KNOW IT WAS HENRY'S ANSWER DOES HE THEN WHY DOES HE STAY HERE HE MADE NO REPLY AND WAS BEGINNING TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT SHE EAGERLY CONTINUED
SHE NOW PLAINLY SAW THAT SHE MUST NOT EXPECT A MANUSCRIPT OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE GENERALITY OF WHAT SHE HAD SHUDDERED OVER IN BOOKS FOR THE ROLL SEEMING TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF SMALL DISJOINTED SHEETS WAS ALTOGETHER BUT OF TRIFLING SIZE
IT WAS TOO DIRTY FOR MISSUS ALLEN TO ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND TO THE PUMP ROOM HE ACCORDINGLY SET OFF BY HIMSELF AND CATHERINE HAD BARELY WATCHED HIM DOWN THE STREET WHEN HER NOTICE WAS CLAIMED BY THE APPROACH OF THE SAME TWO OPEN CARRIAGES
HE IS THE ONLY MAN I EVER DID OR COULD LOVE AND I TRUST YOU WILL CONVINCE HIM OF IT THE SPRING FASHIONS ARE PARTLY DOWN AND THE HATS THE MOST FRIGHTFUL YOU CAN IMAGINE I HOPE YOU SPEND YOUR TIME PLEASANTLY
THE ELDEST YOUNG LADY OBSERVED ALOUD TO THE REST HOW EXCESSIVELY LIKE HER BROTHER MISS MORLAND IS
YOU KNOW SHE MUST BE ATTACHED TO HIM I UNDERSTAND
THE VERY CARRIAGE IS ORDERED AND WILL BE HERE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK AND NO SERVANT WILL BE OFFERED YOU CATHERINE SAT DOWN BREATHLESS AND SPEECHLESS I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY SENSES WHEN I HEARD IT
FOR MY PART I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING I LIKE SO WELL IN THE WHOLE ROOM I ASSURE YOU HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS WHISPERED CATHERINE NOT TO HAVE A SINGLE ACQUAINTANCE HERE
THE GENERAL'S GOOD HUMOUR INCREASED WHY AS HE HAD SUCH ROOMS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE NOT TO MAKE USE OF THEM
I CANNOT BEAR IT I COME TO YOU ON SUCH AN ERRAND ERRAND TO ME HOW SHALL I TELL YOU OH HOW SHALL I TELL YOU A NEW IDEA NOW DARTED INTO CATHERINE'S MIND
SHE HAD BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED OF BEING ARCH THOUGHT THE PRESENT A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR BEING REALLY SO AND THEREFORE GAILY SAID DO NOT BE UNEASY ISABELLA JAMES WILL SOON BE HERE PSHA MY DEAR CREATURE SHE REPLIED DO NOT THINK
SHE BROUGHT HERSELF TO READ THEM AND THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF HER THROWING A WHOLE PARTY INTO RAPTURES BY A PRELUDE ON THE PIANOFORTE OF HER OWN COMPOSITION SHE COULD LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE WITH VERY LITTLE FATIGUE
NOR AN EXPRESSION USED BY EITHER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MADE AND USED SOME THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE UNDER THAT ROOF IN EVERY BATH SEASON
THERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDREN
NOR TO THE PLAY EXCEPT GOING IN LAST NIGHT WITH THE HODGES FOR A FROLIC AT HALF PRICE THEY TEASED ME INTO IT AND I WAS DETERMINED THEY SHOULD NOT SAY I SHUT MYSELF UP BECAUSE TILNEY WAS GONE WE HAPPENED TO SIT BY THE MITCHELLS
THOUGH RATHER THAN BE DISAPPOINTED OF THE PROMISED WALK AND ESPECIALLY RATHER THAN BE THOUGHT ILL OF BY THE TILNEYS SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GIVEN UP ALL THE HAPPINESS WHICH ITS WALLS COULD SUPPLY THE HAPPINESS OF A PROGRESS THROUGH A LONG SUITE OF LOFTY ROOMS
BUT PERHAPS OBSERVED CATHERINE THOUGH SHE HAS BEHAVED SO ILL BY OUR FAMILY SHE MAY BEHAVE BETTER BY YOURS NOW SHE HAS REALLY GOT THE MAN SHE LIKES SHE MAY BE CONSTANT
BUT I NEED NOT ASK YOU FOR YOU LOOK DELIGHTFULLY YOU REALLY HAVE DONE YOUR HAIR IN A MORE HEAVENLY STYLE THAN EVER
THERE SUCH AS WERE NOT AS SPOTLESS AS AN ANGEL MIGHT HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF A FIEND BUT IN ENGLAND IT WAS NOT SO AMONG THE ENGLISH SHE BELIEVED IN THEIR HEARTS AND HABITS
HAD NOT THE EASY GAIETY OF MISS THORPE'S MANNERS AND HER FREQUENT EXPRESSIONS OF DELIGHT ON THIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER SOFTENED DOWN EVERY FEELING OF AWE AND LEFT NOTHING BUT TENDER AFFECTION
LOOKED AT HER ANXIOUSLY CATHERINE TOOK HER PLACE AT THE TABLE AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ELEANOR SAID NO BAD NEWS FROM FULLERTON I HOPE MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS I HOPE THEY ARE NONE OF THEM ILL
I TELL HIM HE IS QUITE IN LUCK TO BE SENT HERE FOR HIS HEALTH AND I HOPE MADAM THAT MISTER ALLEN WILL BE OBLIGED TO LIKE THE PLACE FROM FINDING IT OF SERVICE TO HIM THANK YOU SIR I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE WILL
DILIGENCE OUR POINT WOULD GAIN AND THE UNWEARIED DILIGENCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD EVERY DAY WISHED FOR THE SAME THING WAS AT LENGTH TO HAVE ITS JUST REWARD FOR HARDLY HAD SHE BEEN SEATED TEN MINUTES
THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN USED TO MUCH BETTER SIZED APARTMENTS AT MISTER ALLEN'S NO INDEED WAS CATHERINE'S HONEST ASSURANCE MISTER ALLEN'S DINING PARLOUR WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF AS LARGE AND SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO LARGE A ROOM AS THIS IN HER LIFE
WAS NOT THE YOUNG LADY HE DANCED WITH ON MONDAY A MISS SMITH YES AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS HUGHES I DARE SAY SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO DANCE DO YOU THINK HER PRETTY NOT VERY
WITH MORE THAN USUAL EAGERNESS DID CATHERINE HASTEN TO THE PUMP ROOM THE NEXT DAY SECURE WITHIN HERSELF OF SEEING MISTER TILNEY THERE BEFORE THE MORNING WERE OVER AND READY TO MEET HIM WITH A SMILE BUT NO SMILE WAS DEMANDED
MISSUS HUGHES COULD NOT HAVE APPLIED TO ANY CREATURE IN THE ROOM MORE HAPPY TO OBLIGE HER THAN CATHERINE
AND MAMMA'S APPROBATION WAS EAGERLY GIVEN
MUST FROM SITUATION BE AT THIS TIME THE INTIMATE FRIEND AND CONFIDANTE OF HER SISTER IT IS REMARKABLE HOWEVER THAT SHE NEITHER INSISTED ON CATHERINE'S WRITING BY EVERY POST
THE MORNING HAD ANSWERED ALL HER HOPES AND THE EVENING OF THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS NOW THE OBJECT OF EXPECTATION THE FUTURE GOOD WHAT GOWN AND WHAT HEAD DRESS SHE SHOULD WEAR ON THE OCCASION BECAME HER CHIEF CONCERN
AND DEPENDENCE ON CATHERINE'S HONOUR OH DO NOT SAY MISS TILNEY WAS NOT ANGRY CRIED CATHERINE BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WAS FOR SHE WOULD NOT SEE ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CALLED I SAW HER WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE THE NEXT MINUTE AFTER MY LEAVING IT I WAS HURT BUT I WAS NOT AFFRONTED
THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT SHOULD BE SO MEEKLY BORNE THE POWER OF EARLY HABIT ONLY COULD ACCOUNT FOR IT A DISTINCTION TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BORN GAVE NO PRIDE THEIR SUPERIORITY OF ABODE WAS NO MORE TO THEM THAN THEIR SUPERIORITY OF PERSON
AND TILL THE USUAL MOMENT OF GOING TO THE PUMP ROOM SHE FELT SOME ALARM FROM THE DREAD OF A SECOND PREVENTION BUT NOTHING OF THAT KIND OCCURRED NO VISITORS APPEARED TO DELAY THEM AND THEY ALL THREE SET OFF IN GOOD TIME FOR THE PUMP ROOM
MY TWO YOUNGER SISTERS AND THEIR PARTNERS I HAVE BEEN LAUGHING AT THEM THIS HALF HOUR AGAIN CATHERINE EXCUSED HERSELF AND AT LAST HE WALKED OFF TO QUIZ HIS SISTERS BY HIMSELF THE REST OF THE EVENING SHE FOUND VERY DULL
AND YET SHE LAY AWAKE TEN MINUTES ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT DEBATING BETWEEN HER SPOTTED AND HER TAMBOURED MUSLIN AND NOTHING BUT THE SHORTNESS OF THE TIME PREVENTED HER BUYING A NEW ONE FOR THE EVENING THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT
HOW CAN YOU SAID CATHERINE LAUGHING BE SO SHE HAD ALMOST SAID STRANGE
WISHED TO PLEASE AS SOON AS THEY WERE JOINED BY THE THORPES CATHERINE'S AGONY BEGAN SHE FIDGETED ABOUT IF JOHN THORPE CAME TOWARDS HER HID HERSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM HIS VIEW AND WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR HIM
MISSUS ALLEN SAID CATHERINE THE NEXT MORNING WILL THERE BE ANY HARM IN MY CALLING ON MISS TILNEY TODAY I SHALL NOT BE EASY TILL I HAVE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING GO BY ALL MEANS MY DEAR ONLY PUT ON A WHITE GOWN MISS TILNEY ALWAYS WEARS WHITE
I DIE TO SEE HIM MISTER MORLAND YOU ARE NOT TO LISTEN WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS WHISPERING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE NOW I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE
I DARE SAY IT WILL NOT BE A VERY GOOD BALL I KNOW THE MITCHELLS WILL NOT BE THERE I AM SURE I PITY EVERYBODY THAT IS BUT I DARE SAY MISTER MORLAND YOU LONG TO BE AT IT DO NOT YOU I AM SURE YOU DO
WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
CATHERINE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHY WAS MISS TILNEY EMBARRASSED COULD THERE BE ANY UNWILLINGNESS ON THE GENERAL'S SIDE TO SHOW HER OVER THE ABBEY THE PROPOSAL WAS HIS OWN
BUT CATHERINE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY INJURY OR ANY MISFORTUNE COULD PROVOKE SUCH ILL WILL AGAINST A PERSON NOT CONNECTED OR AT LEAST
ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW HIM THE WAY YOU MAY SEE THE HOUSE FROM THIS WINDOW SIR WAS INFORMATION ON SARAH'S SIDE WHICH PRODUCED ONLY A BOW OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE GENTLEMAN AND A SILENCING NOD FROM HER MOTHER
WHERE THERE ARE HEADS AND ARMS AND LEGS ENOUGH FOR THE NUMBER BUT THE MORLANDS HAD LITTLE OTHER RIGHT TO THE WORD FOR THEY WERE IN GENERAL VERY PLAIN AND CATHERINE FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE AS PLAIN AS ANY
THE MESS ROOM WILL DRINK ISABELLA THORPE FOR A FORTNIGHT AND SHE WILL LAUGH WITH YOUR BROTHER OVER POOR TILNEY'S PASSION FOR A MONTH CATHERINE WOULD CONTEND NO LONGER AGAINST COMFORT
AND ALL OUR AGREEABLENESS BELONGS SOLELY TO EACH OTHER FOR THAT TIME NOBODY CAN FASTEN THEMSELVES ON THE NOTICE OF ONE WITHOUT INJURING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER I CONSIDER A COUNTRY DANCE AS AN EMBLEM OF MARRIAGE
THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM AT NORTHANGER HAD BEEN OF THE MOST UNFRIENDLY KIND HENRY'S INDIGNATION ON HEARING HOW CATHERINE HAD BEEN TREATED ON COMPREHENDING HIS FATHER'S VIEWS AND BEING ORDERED TO ACQUIESCE IN THEM
IT WAS OF CEDAR CURIOUSLY INLAID WITH SOME DARKER WOOD AND RAISED ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND ON A CARVED STAND OF THE SAME THE LOCK WAS SILVER THOUGH TARNISHED FROM AGE
I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
FREDERICK WILL NOT BE THE FIRST MAN WHO HAS CHOSEN A WIFE WITH LESS SENSE THAN HIS FAMILY EXPECTED I DO NOT ENVY HIS SITUATION EITHER AS A LOVER OR A SON MISS TILNEY
I DOUBT OUR BEING ABLE TO DO SO MUCH SAID MORLAND YOU CROAKING FELLOW CRIED THORPE WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DO TEN TIMES MORE KINGSWESTON AYE AND BLAIZE CASTLE TOO AND ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN HEAR OF
A TOTAL INATTENTION TO STOPS AND A VERY FREQUENT IGNORANCE OF GRAMMAR UPON MY WORD I NEED NOT HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF DISCLAIMING THE COMPLIMENT YOU DO NOT THINK TOO HIGHLY OF US IN THAT WAY
WHICH COMMANDED A TOLERABLE VIEW OF EVERYBODY ENTERING AT EITHER IT IS SO OUT OF THE WAY CATHERINE OBSERVING THAT ISABELLA'S EYES WERE CONTINUALLY BENT TOWARDS ONE DOOR OR THE OTHER AS IN EAGER EXPECTATION AND REMEMBERING HOW OFTEN
NOT THAT JAMES HAS EVER TOLD ME SO BUT I AM SURE HE IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND ARE YOU SURE IT IS MY BROTHER'S DOING YES VERY SURE IS IT MY BROTHER'S ATTENTIONS TO MISS THORPE
STRIKING AT THAT INSTANT ON HER MIND WITH PECULIAR FORCE
CATHERINE WALKED ON TO HER CHAMBER MAKING UP HER MIND AS WELL AS SHE COULD TO A FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY AND COMFORTING HERSELF UNDER THE UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION HIS CONDUCT HAD GIVEN HER
CATHERINE'S SPIRITS HOWEVER WERE TRANQUILLIZED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
BEFORE A LADY OF ABOUT HER OWN AGE WHO WAS SITTING BY HER AND HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER ATTENTIVELY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES ADDRESSED HER WITH GREAT COMPLAISANCE IN THESE WORDS
BEFORE THE DELIVERY OF THE LETTERS A NEEDFUL EXERTION FOR AS THE TIME OF REASONABLE EXPECTATION DREW NEAR ISABELLA BECAME MORE AND MORE DESPONDING AND BEFORE THE LETTER ARRIVED HAD WORKED HERSELF INTO A STATE OF REAL DISTRESS
AFTER A SHORT PAUSE CATHERINE RESUMED WITH THEN YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA SO VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER I CAN HAVE NO OPINION ON THAT SUBJECT BUT WHAT CAN YOUR BROTHER MEAN
I HATE THE IDEA OF ONE GREAT FORTUNE LOOKING OUT FOR ANOTHER AND TO MARRY FOR MONEY I THINK THE WICKEDEST THING IN EXISTENCE GOOD DAY
TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT NORTHANGER I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT I EAT THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH SUCH A SUBJECT
AND THE LADIES WALKED ABOUT TOGETHER NOTICING EVERY NEW FACE AND ALMOST EVERY NEW BONNET IN THE ROOM THE FEMALE PART OF THE THORPE FAMILY ATTENDED BY JAMES MORLAND APPEARED AMONG THE CROWD IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
THAT SHE COULD NOT RELIEVE THE IRKSOMENESS OF IMPRISONMENT BY THE EXCHANGE OF A SYLLABLE WITH ANY OF HER FELLOW CAPTIVES AND WHEN AT LAST ARRIVED IN THE TEA ROOM SHE FELT YET MORE THE AWKWARDNESS OF HAVING NO PARTY TO JOIN
THIS WAS OF COURSE VEHEMENTLY TALKED DOWN AS NO REASON AT ALL MISSUS ALLEN WAS CALLED ON TO SECOND HIM AND THE TWO OTHERS WALKED IN TO GIVE THEIR ASSISTANCE MY SWEETEST CATHERINE IS NOT THIS DELIGHTFUL WE SHALL HAVE A MOST HEAVENLY DRIVE
SAID HE AS THEY WALKED BACK TO THE BALLROOM NOT OF YOUR PARTNER I HOPE FOR BY THAT SHAKE OF THE HEAD YOUR MEDITATIONS ARE NOT SATISFACTORY CATHERINE COLOURED AND SAID
I HAVE HAD MY PEN IN MY HAND TO BEGIN A LETTER TO YOU ALMOST EVERY DAY SINCE YOU LEFT BATH BUT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PREVENTED BY SOME SILLY TRIFLER OR OTHER PRAY WRITE TO ME SOON AND DIRECT TO MY OWN HOME
THANK GOD WE LEAVE THIS VILE PLACE TOMORROW SINCE YOU WENT AWAY I HAVE HAD NO PLEASURE IN IT THE DUST IS BEYOND ANYTHING AND EVERYBODY ONE CARES FOR IS GONE I BELIEVE IF I COULD SEE YOU I SHOULD NOT MIND THE REST
AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL MISTER ALLEN'S AS WELL AS HER FATHER'S INCLUDING CHURCH YARD AND ORCHARD
BROKEN PERHAPS PREMATURELY BY SOME STRANGE VIOLENCE AND ON THE CENTRE OF THE LID WAS A MYSTERIOUS CIPHER IN THE SAME METAL CATHERINE BENT OVER IT INTENTLY BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY SHE COULD NOT IN WHATEVER DIRECTION SHE TOOK IT
HALF A MINUTE CONDUCTED THEM THROUGH THE PUMP YARD TO THE ARCHWAY OPPOSITE UNION PASSAGE BUT HERE THEY WERE STOPPED EVERYBODY ACQUAINTED WITH BATH MAY REMEMBER THE DIFFICULTIES OF CROSSING CHEAP STREET AT THIS POINT
WAS VERY IMPORTUNATE WITH ISABELLA TO STAND UP BUT JOHN WAS GONE INTO THE CARD ROOM TO SPEAK TO A FRIEND AND NOTHING SHE DECLARED
SOON AFTER THEIR REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE SET CATHERINE PERCEIVED HERSELF TO BE EARNESTLY REGARDED BY A GENTLEMAN WHO STOOD AMONG THE LOOKERS ON IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HER PARTNER
WELL NAY IF IT IS TO BE GUESSWORK LET US ALL GUESS FOR OURSELVES TO BE GUIDED BY SECOND HAND CONJECTURE IS PITIFUL THE PREMISES ARE BEFORE YOU
AND DESIGNED HER FOR HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ON DISCOVERING HIS ERROR TO TURN HER FROM THE HOUSE SEEMED THE BEST THOUGH TO HIS FEELINGS AN INADEQUATE PROOF OF HIS RESENTMENT TOWARDS HERSELF AND HIS CONTEMPT OF HER FAMILY
IT PROVED TO BE EXACTLY THE CASE CATHERINE HAD NEVER THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT TILL THAT MOMENT BUT UPON EXAMINING HER PURSE WAS CONVINCED THAT BUT FOR THIS KINDNESS OF HER FRIEND SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TURNED FROM THE HOUSE WITHOUT EVEN THE MEANS OF GETTING HOME
MANY WERE THE INQUIRIES SHE WAS EAGER TO MAKE OF MISS TILNEY BUT SO ACTIVE WERE HER THOUGHTS THAT WHEN THESE INQUIRIES WERE ANSWERED SHE WAS HARDLY MORE ASSURED THAN BEFORE
LET ME SOON HEAR FROM YOU DEAR CATHERINE YOU ARE MY ONLY FRIEND YOUR LOVE I DO BUILD UPON I WISH YOUR VISIT AT NORTHANGER MAY BE OVER BEFORE CAPTAIN TILNEY MAKES HIS ENGAGEMENT KNOWN
THAT THE READER MAY BE ABLE TO JUDGE IN WHAT MANNER HER ACTIONS WILL HEREAFTER TEND TO PROMOTE THE GENERAL DISTRESS OF THE WORK AND HOW SHE WILL PROBABLY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCE POOR CATHERINE TO ALL THE DESPERATE WRETCHEDNESS
NOW LEFT HER WITH I SHALL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING CATHERINE'S SWELLING HEART NEEDED RELIEF IN ELEANOR'S PRESENCE FRIENDSHIP AND PRIDE HAD EQUALLY RESTRAINED HER TEARS BUT NO SOONER WAS SHE GONE THAN THEY BURST FORTH IN TORRENTS
MISTER TILNEY DID NOT APPEAR EVERY CREATURE IN BATH EXCEPT HIMSELF WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE ROOM AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE FASHIONABLE HOURS
HER FINGERS GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND A THIRD A FOURTH EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED
ENCOURAGED HIS HORSE MADE ODD NOISES AND DROVE ON AND CATHERINE ANGRY AND VEXED AS SHE WAS HAVING NO POWER OF GETTING AWAY WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE POINT AND SUBMIT HER REPROACHES HOWEVER WERE NOT SPARED
HOW PROPER MISTER TILNEY MIGHT BE AS A DREAMER OR A LOVER HAD NOT YET PERHAPS ENTERED MISTER ALLEN'S HEAD BUT THAT HE WAS NOT OBJECTIONABLE AS A COMMON ACQUAINTANCE FOR HIS YOUNG CHARGE
AND SHE WAS PREPARING TO UNPIN THE LINEN PACKAGE WHICH THE CHAISE SEAT HAD CONVEYED FOR HER IMMEDIATE ACCOMMODATION WHEN HER EYE SUDDENLY FELL ON A LARGE HIGH CHEST STANDING BACK IN A DEEP RECESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE THE SIGHT OF IT MADE HER START
CATHERINE TOOK UP HER WORK DIRECTLY SAYING IN A DEJECTED VOICE THAT HER HEAD DID NOT RUN UPON BATH MUCH THEN YOU ARE FRETTING ABOUT GENERAL TILNEY AND THAT IS VERY SIMPLE OF YOU
YOU MEN HAVE SUCH RESTLESS CURIOSITY TALK OF THE CURIOSITY OF WOMEN INDEED TIS NOTHING BUT BE SATISFIED FOR YOU ARE NOT TO KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL OF THE MATTER AND IS THAT LIKELY TO SATISFY ME DO YOU THINK
AND AGAIN SOLICITED TO DANCE BY MISTER TILNEY HIMSELF WITH WHAT SPARKLING EYES AND READY MOTION SHE GRANTED HIS REQUEST AND WITH HOW PLEASING A FLUTTER OF HEART SHE WENT WITH HIM TO THE SET MAY BE EASILY IMAGINED
THANK YOU SAID CATHERINE
AND HENRY'S GRATIFIED LOOK ON BEING TOLD THAT HER STAY WAS DETERMINED
YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF THAT TROUBLE SIR NO TROUBLE I ASSURE YOU MADAM THEN FORMING HIS FEATURES INTO A SET SMILE AND AFFECTEDLY SOFTENING HIS VOICE HE ADDED WITH A SIMPERING AIR
AND HE REPLIED IN A TONE WHICH RETAINED ONLY A LITTLE AFFECTED RESERVE WE WERE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU AT ANY RATE FOR WISHING US A PLEASANT WALK AFTER OUR PASSING YOU IN ARGYLE STREET YOU WERE SO KIND AS TO LOOK BACK ON PURPOSE
ELEANOR SEEMED NOW IMPELLED INTO RESOLUTION AND SPEECH YOU MUST WRITE TO ME CATHERINE SHE CRIED YOU MUST LET ME HEAR FROM YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TILL I KNOW YOU TO BE SAFE AT HOME I SHALL NOT HAVE AN HOUR'S COMFORT
CATHERINE HAD NO LEISURE FOR SPEECH BEING AT ONCE BLUSHING TYING HER GOWN AND FORMING WISE RESOLUTIONS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT DISPATCH MISS TILNEY GENTLY HINTED HER FEAR OF BEING LATE AND IN HALF A MINUTE THEY RAN DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER IN AN ALARM NOT WHOLLY UNFOUNDED
AND THE PRAISE OF SUCH A GIRL AS MISS THORPE EVEN YOU CATHERINE
AS THE CAUSE OF HIS INTRUSION HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIMSELF TO AN UNCANDID JUDGE OR A RESENTFUL HEART FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HIM OR HIS SISTER IN THEIR FATHER'S MISCONDUCT
THIS BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE FAMILY IS INTENDED TO SUPERSEDE THE NECESSITY OF A LONG AND MINUTE DETAIL FROM MISSUS THORPE HERSELF OF HER PAST ADVENTURES AND SUFFERINGS
I THOUGHT HOW IT WOULD BE SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WALK FOR ME TODAY SIGHED CATHERINE BUT PERHAPS IT MAY COME TO NOTHING OR IT MAY HOLD UP BEFORE TWELVE PERHAPS IT MAY BUT THEN MY DEAR
AFTER ELEANOR HAD AFFECTIONATELY EXPRESSED A WISH OF BEING OF USE OR COMFORT TO HER AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S FREE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF AND REFLECTION CATHERINE FELT EQUAL TO ENCOUNTERING HER FRIENDS
PERHAPS SAID MISS TILNEY IN AN EMBARRASSED MANNER YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD IT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY IF THE ENTRANCE OF HER FATHER PUT A STOP TO THE CIVILITY
I KNOW BUT I WILL NOT PAIN YOU BY DESCRIBING MY ANXIETY YOU HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF IT I FEEL THAT I HAVE BETRAYED MYSELF PERPETUALLY SO UNGUARDED IN SPEAKING OF MY PARTIALITY FOR THE CHURCH BUT MY SECRET I WAS ALWAYS SURE WOULD BE SAFE WITH YOU
AND SO I AM AT HOME ONLY I DO NOT FIND SO MUCH OF IT I WALK ABOUT HERE AND SO I DO THERE BUT HERE I SEE A VARIETY OF PEOPLE IN EVERY STREET AND THERE I CAN ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN
BESTOWING A RICH AUNT AND SINKING HALF THE CHILDREN HE WAS ABLE TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE FAMILY TO THE GENERAL IN A MOST RESPECTABLE LIGHT FOR CATHERINE HOWEVER THE PECULIAR OBJECT OF THE GENERAL'S CURIOSITY
FOR GENERAL TILNEY WAS PACING THE DRAWING ROOM HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND AND HAVING ON THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR ENTERING PULLED THE BELL WITH VIOLENCE ORDERED DINNER TO BE ON TABLE DIRECTLY CATHERINE TREMBLED AT THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE
BUT I KNEW THE FICKLE SEX TOO WELL HE WENT AWAY TO HIS REGIMENT TWO DAYS AGO AND I TRUST I SHALL NEVER BE PLAGUED WITH HIM AGAIN HE IS THE GREATEST COXCOMB I EVER SAW AND AMAZINGLY DISAGREEABLE
THAT YOU THINK THEY CANNOT BE COMPARED TOGETHER TO BE SURE NOT PEOPLE THAT MARRY CAN NEVER PART BUT MUST GO AND KEEP HOUSE TOGETHER PEOPLE THAT DANCE ONLY STAND OPPOSITE EACH OTHER IN A LONG ROOM FOR HALF AN HOUR
CATHERINE HERSELF COULD NOT BE MORE IGNORANT AT THE TIME OF ALL THIS THAN HIS OWN CHILDREN HENRY AND ELEANOR PERCEIVING NOTHING IN HER SITUATION LIKELY TO ENGAGE THEIR FATHER'S PARTICULAR RESPECT
WHICH IT MUST BE MORE PLEASANT FOR HIM TO COMMUNICATE ONLY TO CATHERINE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PREVENT HER ACCOMPANYING HIM THEY BEGAN THEIR WALK AND MISSUS MORLAND WAS NOT ENTIRELY MISTAKEN IN HIS OBJECT IN WISHING IT
YES SIR AND DOCTOR SKINNER AND HIS FAMILY WERE HERE THREE MONTHS SO I TELL MISTER ALLEN HE MUST NOT BE IN A HURRY TO GET AWAY
UPON MY HONOUR SAID JAMES IN THESE PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES IT IS AS OFTEN DONE AS NOT NONSENSE HOW CAN YOU SAY SO BUT WHEN YOU MEN HAVE A POINT TO CARRY YOU NEVER STICK AT ANYTHING
AND HUNG OVER HER WITH AFFECTIONATE SOLICITUDE MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU MUST NOT YOU MUST NOT INDEED WERE ELEANOR'S FIRST CONNECTED WORDS I AM QUITE WELL THIS KINDNESS DISTRACTS ME
BUT WE MUST FIRST SUPPOSE ISABELLA TO HAVE HAD A HEART TO LOSE CONSEQUENTLY TO HAVE BEEN A VERY DIFFERENT CREATURE AND IN THAT CASE SHE WOULD HAVE MET WITH VERY DIFFERENT TREATMENT IT IS VERY RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD STAND BY YOUR BROTHER
THAN MISS TILNEY TOLD HER OF HER FATHER'S HAVING JUST DETERMINED UPON QUITTING BATH BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK HERE WAS A BLOW THE PAST SUSPENSE OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN EASE AND QUIET TO THE PRESENT DISAPPOINTMENT
CATHERINE FELT THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN SAFER BUT ASHAMED OF AN IGNORANCE LITTLE EXPECTED SHE DARED NO LONGER CONTEST THE POINT NOR REFUSE TO HAVE BEEN AS FULL OF ARCH PENETRATION AND AFFECTIONATE SYMPATHY AS ISABELLA CHOSE TO CONSIDER HER
THE COTILLIONS WERE OVER THE COUNTRY DANCING BEGINNING AND SHE SAW NOTHING OF THE TILNEYS DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED MY DEAR CATHERINE WHISPERED ISABELLA BUT I AM REALLY GOING TO DANCE WITH YOUR BROTHER AGAIN
OH BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN THERE SO LONG NAY IF YOU CAN USE SUCH A WORD I CAN URGE YOU NO FARTHER IF YOU THINK IT LONG OH NO I DO NOT INDEED
THAT NOBODY COULD IMAGINE HOW CHARMING IT HAD BEEN AND THAT IT HAD BEEN MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN ANYBODY COULD CONCEIVE SUCH WAS THE INFORMATION OF THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES THE SECOND UNFOLDED THUS MUCH IN DETAIL
WITH A DEGREE OF MODERATION AND COMPOSURE WHICH SEEMED RATHER CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMON FEELINGS OF COMMON LIFE THAN WITH THE REFINED SUSCEPTIBILITIES THE TENDER EMOTIONS WHICH THE FIRST SEPARATION OF A HEROINE FROM HER FAMILY OUGHT ALWAYS TO EXCITE
AS IF BY THE ATTEMPT OF SOMEBODY TO ENTER HOLLOW MURMURS SEEMED TO CREEP ALONG THE GALLERY AND MORE THAN ONCE HER BLOOD WAS CHILLED BY THE SOUND OF DISTANT MOANS
CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
YES SIR I WAS THERE LAST MONDAY HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE THEATRE YES SIR I WAS AT THE PLAY ON TUESDAY TO THE CONCERT YES SIR
AND FROM THE WHOLE SHE DEDUCED THIS USEFUL LESSON THAT TO GO PREVIOUSLY ENGAGED TO A BALL DOES NOT NECESSARILY INCREASE EITHER THE DIGNITY OR ENJOYMENT OF A YOUNG LADY
IN SHORT SHE MADE HERSELF AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WENT DOWN WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK FIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL
MISS TILNEY HAD A GOOD FIGURE A PRETTY FACE AND A VERY AGREEABLE COUNTENANCE AND HER AIR THOUGH IT HAD NOT ALL THE DECIDED PRETENSION THE RESOLUTE STYLISHNESS OF MISS THORPE'S HAD MORE REAL ELEGANCE
AND WAS NOW CHIEFLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID HIS SIGHT LEST HE SHOULD ENGAGE HER AGAIN FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT DARED NOT EXPECT THAT MISTER TILNEY SHOULD ASK HER A THIRD TIME TO DANCE
THIS INAPPLICABLE ANSWER MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH FOR THE COMPREHENSION OF MANY BUT IT DID NOT PUZZLE MISSUS ALLEN FOR AFTER ONLY A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION SHE SAID IN A WHISPER TO CATHERINE
THOUGH EVIDENTLY INTENDING TO COME IN
CONFUSED BY HIS NOTICE AND BLUSHING FROM THE FEAR OF ITS BEING EXCITED BY SOMETHING WRONG IN HER APPEARANCE SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD
HE RAN IT A FEW WEEKS TILL I BELIEVE IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT
BUT IT IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE I HOPE I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT TO YOUR REAL SAFETY IT WILL BE OF NONE BUT TO EVERYTHING ELSE IT IS OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO COMFORT APPEARANCE PROPRIETY
FAR MORE READY TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND EACH HEARING VERY LITTLE OF WHAT THE OTHER SAID MISSUS THORPE HOWEVER HAD ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE AS A TALKER OVER MISSUS ALLEN IN A FAMILY OF CHILDREN
FRENCH BY HER MOTHER HER PROFICIENCY IN EITHER WAS NOT REMARKABLE AND SHE SHIRKED HER LESSONS IN BOTH WHENEVER SHE COULD WHAT A STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE CHARACTER FOR WITH ALL THESE SYMPTOMS OF PROFLIGACY AT TEN YEARS OLD
WILL BE NATURALLY SUPPOSED TO BE MOST SEVERE A THOUSAND ALARMING PRESENTIMENTS OF EVIL TO HER BELOVED CATHERINE FROM THIS TERRIFIC SEPARATION MUST OPPRESS HER HEART WITH SADNESS
HAD SEEN WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SUDDENNESS CONTINUANCE AND EXTENT OF HIS ATTENTION AND THOUGH LATTERLY FROM SOME HINTS WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED AN ALMOST POSITIVE COMMAND TO HIS SON OF DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO ATTACH HER
THORPE TALKED TO HIS HORSE AND SHE MEDITATED BY TURNS ON BROKEN PROMISES AND BROKEN ARCHES PHAETONS AND FALSE HANGINGS TILNEYS AND TRAP DOORS AS THEY ENTERED ARGYLE BUILDINGS HOWEVER SHE WAS ROUSED BY THIS ADDRESS FROM HER COMPANION
IN WHAT POINTS HIS OWN CONJECTURES MIGHT ASSIST HIM AND WHAT PORTION MUST YET REMAIN TO BE TOLD IN A LETTER FROM JAMES
MISS TILNEY EXPRESSING A PROPER SENSE OF SUCH GOODNESS MISS MORLAND WITH THE REAL DELICACY OF A GENEROUS MIND MAKING LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION
TO SUPPOSE THAT A MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN A ROOM SUCH AS THAT SO MODERN SO HABITABLE
I REMEMBER I WORE MY YELLOW GOWN WITH MY HAIR DONE UP IN BRAIDS AND WHEN I CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND JOHN INTRODUCED HIM I THOUGHT I NEVER SAW ANYBODY SO HANDSOME BEFORE HERE
YOU ARE TO THANK YOUR BROTHER AND ME FOR THE SCHEME IT DARTED INTO OUR HEADS AT BREAKFAST TIME I VERILY BELIEVE AT THE SAME INSTANT AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFF TWO HOURS AGO IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS DETESTABLE RAIN BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE NIGHTS ARE MOONLIGHT AND WE SHALL DO DELIGHTFULLY
NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE
HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HER SUFFERINGS RATHER TOO ACUTE THE VERY EASY MANNER IN WHICH HE THEN TOLD HER THAT HE HAD KEPT HER WAITING DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RECONCILE HER MORE TO HER LOT NOR DID THE PARTICULARS WHICH HE ENTERED INTO WHILE THEY WERE STANDING UP
AND THE STEEP WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND TO GIVE IT SHELTER WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY BETTER AUTHORITY SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE
THE LIBERTY WHICH HER IMAGINATION HAD DARED TO TAKE WITH THE CHARACTER OF HIS FATHER COULD HE EVER FORGIVE IT THE ABSURDITY OF HER CURIOSITY AND HER FEARS COULD THEY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
AND WITHOUT EXAGGERATED FEELINGS OF ECSTATIC DELIGHT OR INCONCEIVABLE VEXATION ON EVERY LITTLE TRIFLING OCCURRENCE CATHERINE INTERESTED AT ONCE BY HER APPEARANCE AND HER RELATIONSHIP TO MISTER TILNEY
HE WAS ENCHANTED BY HER APPROBATION OF HIS TASTE CONFESSED IT TO BE NEAT AND SIMPLE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR HIS PART TO HIS UNCRITICAL PALATE THE TEA WAS AS WELL FLAVOURED FROM THE CLAY OF STAFFORDSHIRE
INCONCEIVABLE HENRY FREDERICK TOO WHO ALWAYS WORE HIS HEART SO PROUDLY
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR FIFTEEN SONNETS IN CELEBRATION OF HER CHARMS AND WENT TO HER CHAIR IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH EVERYBODY
COULD NOT TAKE PLACE TILL AFTER THREE OR FOUR DAYS HAD BEEN SPENT IN LEARNING WHAT WAS MOSTLY WORN AND HER CHAPERONE WAS PROVIDED WITH A DRESS OF THE NEWEST FASHION CATHERINE TOO MADE SOME PURCHASES HERSELF
AND BY JOHN'S ENGAGING HER BEFORE THEY PARTED TO DANCE WITH HIM THAT EVENING HAD SHE BEEN OLDER OR VAINER SUCH ATTACKS MIGHT HAVE DONE LITTLE
BUT INDEED I DID NOT WISH YOU A PLEASANT WALK I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING BUT I BEGGED MISTER THORPE SO EARNESTLY TO STOP I CALLED OUT TO HIM AS SOON AS EVER I SAW YOU NOW MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT OH YOU WERE NOT THERE BUT INDEED I DID AND IF MISTER THORPE WOULD ONLY HAVE STOPPED
ON HAVING PRESERVED HER GOWN FROM INJURY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SHOCKING TO HAVE IT TORN
TILL THE VERY LAST IF I REASONED WITH HER SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER
IS NOT SHE YES VERY MUCH INDEED I FANCY MISTER ALLEN THINKS HER THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN BATH I DARE SAY HE DOES AND I DO NOT KNOW ANY MAN WHO IS A BETTER JUDGE OF BEAUTY THAN MISTER ALLEN
SPOKE OF THEM IN TERMS WHICH MADE HER ALL EAGERNESS TO KNOW THEM TOO AND ON HER OPENLY FEARING THAT SHE MIGHT FIND NOBODY TO GO WITH HER IT WAS PROPOSED BY THE BROTHER AND SISTER THAT THEY SHOULD JOIN IN A WALK SOME MORNING OR OTHER I SHALL LIKE IT SHE CRIED
WAS RATHER TALL HAD A PLEASING COUNTENANCE A VERY INTELLIGENT AND LIVELY EYE AND IF NOT QUITE HANDSOME WAS VERY NEAR IT HIS ADDRESS WAS GOOD
AND SPURNING A FRIENDSHIP WHICH COULD BE NO LONGER SERVICEABLE HASTENED TO CONTRADICT ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MORLANDS CONFESSED HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN TOTALLY MISTAKEN IN HIS OPINION OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND CHARACTER
AND BEING AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN DAILY EXPECTATION OF MORLAND'S ENGAGING ISABELLA BUT LIKEWISE PRETTY WELL RESOLVED UPON MARRYING CATHERINE HIMSELF
MODESTY AND ALL THAT IS VERY WELL IN ITS WAY BUT REALLY A LITTLE COMMON HONESTY IS SOMETIMES QUITE AS BECOMING I HAVE NO IDEA OF BEING SO OVERSTRAINED IT IS FISHING FOR COMPLIMENTS HIS ATTENTIONS WERE SUCH AS A CHILD MUST HAVE NOTICED
THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
THE HORSE WAS IMMEDIATELY CHECKED WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH ALMOST THREW HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES
HENRY WAS CONVINCED OF HIS FATHER'S BELIEVING IT TO BE AN ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION IT WAS NOT TILL THE LATE EXPLANATION AT NORTHANGER THAT THEY HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF THE FALSE CALCULATIONS WHICH HAD HURRIED HIM ON
UNDER THESE UNPROMISING AUSPICES THE PARTING TOOK PLACE AND THE JOURNEY BEGAN IT WAS PERFORMED WITH SUITABLE QUIETNESS AND UNEVENTFUL SAFETY NEITHER ROBBERS NOR TEMPESTS BEFRIENDED THEM
AND IN ONE MOMENT ALL WAS JOYFUL SECURITY THE BRIGHTEST GLOW WAS INSTANTLY SPREAD OVER ISABELLA'S FEATURES ALL CARE AND ANXIETY SEEMED REMOVED HER SPIRITS BECAME ALMOST TOO HIGH FOR CONTROL AND SHE CALLED HERSELF WITHOUT SCRUPLE
AND AFTER MOVING IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY FOR SOME INSTANTS WITH THE DETERMINED CELERITY OF HOPE'S LAST EFFORT THE DOOR SUDDENLY YIELDED TO HER HAND HER HEART LEAPED WITH EXULTATION AT SUCH A VICTORY
THE AGREEABLENESS THE COMPLIANCE ARE EXPECTED FROM HIM WHILE SHE FURNISHES THE FAN AND THE LAVENDER WATER THAT I SUPPOSE WAS THE DIFFERENCE OF DUTIES WHICH STRUCK YOU AS RENDERING THE CONDITIONS INCAPABLE OF COMPARISON
WOULD IT BE TO PROMOTE HIS HAPPINESS TO ENABLE HIM TO MARRY SUCH A GIRL SHE MUST BE AN UNPRINCIPLED ONE OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE USED YOUR BROTHER SO AND HOW STRANGE AN INFATUATION ON FREDERICK'S SIDE A GIRL
BUT WAS STRANGELY HARASSED BY A QUEER HALF WITTED MAN WHO WOULD MAKE ME DANCE WITH HIM AND DISTRESSED ME BY HIS NONSENSE INDEED I SHALL SAY NO SUCH THING
AND MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE AN INVENTORY OF LINEN
AS LEFT HER ONLY JUST SO MUCH SOLICITUDE AS THE HUMAN MIND CAN NEVER DO COMFORTABLY WITHOUT SHE DID ALMOST ALWAYS
WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE
YOUR BROTHER AND I WERE AGREEING THIS MORNING THAT THOUGH IT IS VASTLY WELL TO BE HERE FOR A FEW WEEKS WE WOULD NOT LIVE HERE FOR MILLIONS WE SOON FOUND OUT THAT OUR TASTES WERE EXACTLY ALIKE IN PREFERRING THE COUNTRY TO EVERY OTHER PLACE
MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE HE WAS SURE MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE AND IN THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS
JEROME MADE A DASH FROM THE SHELTER OF THE LAVA BLOCK AND BEGAN FORCING HIS WAY BACK AGAINST THE WIND TO THE HOT SPRINGS WAVERING AND STRUGGLING TO RESIST BEING CARRIED AWAY AS IF HE WERE FORDING A RAPID STREAM
OTHERS HALF SETTLE DOWN AND CHANGE IN PART INTO FARMERS EACH MAKING CHOICE OF SOME FERTILE SPOT WHERE THE LANDSCAPE ATTRACTS HIM BUILDS A SMALL CABIN WHERE WITH FEW WANTS TO SUPPLY FROM GARDEN OR FIELD HE HUNTS AND FARMS IN TURN
THE BEGINNING OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE TREASURED WRATH OF THE LORD UPON THE GENTILES FOR THE KILLING OF JOSEPH SMITH TO ME IT SEEMED A CORDIAL OUTPOURING OF NATURE'S LOVE BUT IT IS EASY TO DIFFER WITH SALT LATTER DAYS IN EVERYTHING STORMS WIVES
THE PETALS BEING STRONGLY RECURVED LIKE THOSE OF LILIUM SUPERBUM OCCASIONALLY A SPECIMEN IS MET WHICH HAS FROM TWO TO FIVE FLOWERS HUNG IN A LOOSE PANICLE PEOPLE OFTENTIMES TRAVEL FAR TO SEE CURIOUS PLANTS LIKE THE CARNIVOROUS DARLINGTONIA
FELL AWAY FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE IN FLOWING FOLDS MORE EXTENSIVE AND CONTINUOUS THAN ANY I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE WHEN DAY DAWNED THE CLOUDS WERE CRAWLING SLOWLY AND BECOMING MORE MASSIVE BUT GAVE NO INTIMATION OF IMMEDIATE DANGER
NEVER BEFORE IN ALL MY WALKS HAVE I MET SO GLORIOUS A THRONG OF THESE FINE SHOWY LILIACEOUS PLANTS THE WHOLE MOUNTAINSIDE WAS AGLOW WITH THEM FROM A HEIGHT OF FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE SNOW
A DIM NEBULOUS EXPANSE OF WOODS BY THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW THAT RAILROADS AND STEAMERS HAVE BROUGHT THE COUNTRY OUT OF THE WILDERNESS AND ABOLISHED THE OLD DISTANCES IT IS NOW NEAR TO ALL THE WORLD AND IS IN POSSESSION OF A SHARE OF THE BEST OF ALL THAT CIVILIZATION HAS TO OFFER
PROBABLY INFLUENCED SOMEWHAT BY RADIATION FROM THE SUN WARMED CLIFFS A COMMON BUMBLEBEE NOT AT ALL BENUMBED ZIGZAGGED VIGOROUSLY ABOUT OUR HEADS FOR A FEW MOMENTS AS IF UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THE NEAREST HONEY FLOWER WAS A MILE BENEATH HIM
POLITICS AND RELIGION ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE STORM REACHED THE CITY I WAS SO FORTUNATE AS TO BE OUT WITH A FRIEND ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN ENJOYING THE SCENERY CLOUDS WITH PECULIARLY RESTLESS AND SELF CONSCIOUS GESTURES
THIRTY OR FORTY MILES EASTWARD FROM SEATTLE
PUTTING ON AIRS AS SOME WOULD SAY LIKE BOYS IN HASTE TO BE MEN THEY ARE ALREADY TOWNS WITH ALL MODERN IMPROVEMENTS FIRST CLASS IN EVERY PARTICULAR AS IS SAID OF HOTELS THEY HAVE ELECTRIC MOTORS AND LIGHTS
THE CRYSTAL FLAKES FALLING IN THE FOUL STREETS WAS A PITIFUL SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VAUNTED REFINING INFLUENCES OF TOWNS PURITY OF ALL KINDS PURE HEARTS PURE STREAMS PURE SNOW
NATURE TAKES THE FEET AND TEETH OF HER FLOCKS INTO ACCOUNT AND MAKES USE OF THEM TO TRIM AND CULTIVATE AND KEEP THEM IN ORDER AS THE BARK AND BUDS OF THE TREE ARE TENDED BY WOODPECKERS AND LINNETS THE EVERGREEN WOODS CONSIST AS FAR AS I OBSERVED OF TWO SPECIES
DARKENING THE AIR AS THEY PASSED AND PRODUCING A CHILL AS DEFINITE AND SUDDEN AS IF ICE WATER HAD BEEN DASHED IN MY FACE THIS IS THE KIND OF CLOUD IN WHICH SNOW FLOWERS GROW AND I TURNED AND FLED
WE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PASS THE REST OF THE DAY AND NIGHT ON THE SUMMIT BUT ANXIETY TO COMPLETE MY OBSERVATIONS STIFLED MY OWN INSTINCTIVE PROMPTINGS TO RETREAT AND HELD ME TO MY WORK NO INEXPERIENCED PERSON WAS DEPENDING ON ME
EACH FEARING THE OTHER MIGHT BE BENUMBED OR DEAD THE ORDINARY SENSATIONS OF COLD GIVE BUT A FAINT CONCEPTION OF THAT WHICH COMES ON AFTER HARD CLIMBING WITH WANT OF FOOD AND SLEEP IN SUCH EXPOSURE AS THIS LIFE IS THEN SEEN TO BE A FIRE
ARE TWO SPECIES OF ZIGADENAS FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA
I SHOOK MY BIG HANDFUL OF LILIES IN HIS FACE AND SHOUTED HERE ARE THE TRUE SAINTS ANCIENT AND LATTER DAY ENDURING FOREVER
OFTEN CURIOUSLY FRECKLED LIKE THE PETALS OF FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA THEY ARE FRUIT RATHER THAN FLOWER GOOD BROWN BREAD BUT DOWN IN THE SAN PITCH VALLEY AT GUNNISON I DISCOVERED A GENUINE LILY HAPPILY NAMED LILY YOUNG
ONLY THE CHILDREN HAILED THEM WITH DELIGHT THE OLD LATTER DAYS SEEMED TO SHUN THEM I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW MISTER YOUNG THE LAKE PROPHET WOULD MEET SUCH MESSENGERS BUT TO RETURN TO THE STORM
HE IS A DANGEROUS ANIMAL A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE FAMOUS GRIZZLY AND WISE HUNTERS ARE VERY FOND OF LETTING HIM ALONE THE TOWNS OF PUGET SOUND ARE OF A VERY LIVELY PROGRESSIVE AND ASPIRING KIND
LYING THIRTY FIVE MILES TO THE SOUTH WAS IN FULL SIGHT ALSO AND THE RIVER JORDAN WHICH LINKS THE TWO TOGETHER MAY BE TRACED IN SILVERY GLEAMS THROUGHOUT ITS WHOLE COURSE
AND EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED HUNTERS HAVE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEM OF BEARS THERE ARE TWO SPECIES THE BLACK AND THE LARGE BROWN THE FORMER BY FAR THE MORE COMMON OF THE TWO ON THE SHAGGY BOTTOM LANDS WHERE BERRIES ARE PLENTIFUL
A DARK BROWNISH CLOUD APPEARED CLOSE DOWN ON THE PLAIN TOWARDS THE LAKE EXTENDING FROM THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE OQUIRRH RANGE IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH ITS PECULIAR COLOR AND STRUCTURE
STROKE FOLLOWING STROKE IN QUICK PASSIONATE SUCCESSION AS THOUGH THE MOUNTAIN WERE BEING RENT TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND THE FIRES OF THE OLD VOLCANO WERE BREAKING FORTH AGAIN COULD WE AT ONCE HAVE BEGUN TO DESCEND THE SNOW SLOPES LEADING TO THE TIMBER
THE CREATIVE SUN SHONE GLORIOUS ON THE VAST EXPANSE OF CLOUDLAND HILL AND DALE MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY SPRINGING INTO EXISTENCE RESPONSIVE TO HIS RAYS AND STEADILY DEVELOPING IN BEAUTY AND INDIVIDUALITY
AND THEIR MARVELOUS PROFUSION OF ORNATE SCULPTURE WERE MOST IMPRESSIVELY MANIFEST ONE WOULD FANCY THAT A MAN MIGHT BE CLEARLY SEEN WALKING ON THE SNOW AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES WHILE WE WERE REVELING IN THIS RARE UNGARISH GRANDEUR
UNTIL THE SPRING WINDS BLOW AND THESE WINTER LILIES WITHER IN TURN THEN THE HIDING ERYTHRONIUMS AND FRITILLARIAS RISE AGAIN RESPONSIVE TO THE FIRST TOUCHES OF THE SUN I NOTICED THE TRACKS OF DEER IN MANY PLACES AMONG THE LILY GARDENS
AND THE FARMERS GRAIN ARE FRESH AS IF LIKE THE SNOW THEY HAD COME OUT OF HEAVEN
MOSTLY BARE THAT EXTENDS FROM NEAR THE CAMP GROUND AT THE TIMBERLINE BUT ON MY FIRST EXCURSION TO THE SUMMIT THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO ITS LOW SWELLING BASE WAS SMOOTHLY LADEN WITH LOOSE FRESH SNOW
BUT IN TROUT FISHING AND BEAR HUNTING AND IN THE TWO FINE FALLS ON THE RIVER FORMERLY THE TRIP FROM SEATTLE WAS A HARD ONE OVER CORDUROY ROADS NOW IT IS REACHED IN A FEW HOURS BY RAIL ALONG THE SHORES OF LAKE WASHINGTON AND LAKE SQUAK
WATCHING THE GESTURES OF THE TREES IN TAKING THE SNOW EXAMINING SEPARATE CRYSTALS UNDER A LENS AND LEARNING THE METHODS OF THEIR DEPOSITION AS AN ENDURING FOUNTAIN FOR THE STREAMS SEVERAL TIMES WHEN THE STORM CEASED FOR A FEW MINUTES
MOUNTAINEERS HOWEVER ALWAYS FIND IN THEMSELVES A RESERVE OF POWER AFTER GREAT EXHAUSTION IT IS A KIND OF SECOND LIFE AVAILABLE ONLY IN EMERGENCIES LIKE THIS AND HAVING PROVED ITS EXISTENCE I HAD NO GREAT FEAR THAT EITHER OF US WOULD FAIL
BOOMED AND SURGED AMID THE DESOLATE CRAGS LIGHTNING FLASHES IN QUICK SUCCESSION CUT THE GLOOMY DARKNESS AND THE THUNDERS THE MOST TREMENDOUSLY LOUD AND APPALLING I EVER HEARD MADE AN ALMOST CONTINUOUS ROAR
DRAWN OUT IN LONG FAIRY WEBS LIKE CARDED WOOL FORMING AND DISSOLVING AS IF BY MAGIC THE WIND TWISTED THEM INTO RINGLETS AND WHIRLED THEM IN A SUCCESSION OF GRACEFUL CONVOLUTIONS LIKE THE OUTSIDE SPRAYS OF YOSEMITE FALLS IN FLOOD TIME
AND WHILE PLANTING THE PLAINS WITH SAGE AND THE HILLS WITH CEDAR SHE HAS COVERED AT LEAST ONE MOUNTAIN WITH GOLDEN ERYTHRONIUMS AND FRITILLARIAS AS ITS CROWNING GLORY AS IF WILLING TO SHOW WHAT SHE COULD DO IN THE LILY LINE EVEN HERE
BUT COLD GRAY MASSES DRIFTING LIKE DUST ON A WIND SWEPT PLAIN BEGAN TO SHUT OUT THE LIGHT FORERUNNERS OF THE COMING STORM I HAD BEEN SO ANXIOUSLY WATCHING I MADE HASTE TO GATHER AS MUCH WOOD AS POSSIBLE
THE FLY CATCHER THE WALKING FERN ET CETERA I HARDLY KNOW HOW THE LITTLE BELLS I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING WOULD BE REGARDED BY SEEKERS OF THIS CLASS BUT EVERY TRUE FLOWER LOVER WHO COMES TO CONSIDER THESE UTAH LILIES WILL SURELY BE WELL REWARDED HOWEVER LONG THE WAY
AND INDICATED THE WAY AS WELL AS HE COULD IN THE DARKNESS HE SEEMED LOATH TO LEAVE ME BUT BEING REASSURED THAT I WAS AT HOME AND REQUIRED NO CARE HE BADE ME GOOD BYE AND RETURNED TO CAMP READY TO LEAD HIS ANIMALS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AT DAYBREAK
AMONG THE TREES AND STUMPS AND BRUSH WHICH HIDE A GOOD MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THE STAKES WHICH MARK THE LOTS SO THAT WITHOUT BEING AS YET VERY LARGE TOWNS THEY SEEM TO FADE AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE
SUGGESTING TO US THE IDEA OF AT ONCE SEEKING OUR SAFE CAMP IN THE TIMBER AND ABANDONING THE PURPOSE OF MAKING AN OBSERVATION OF THE BAROMETER AT THREE P M TWO HAVING ALREADY BEEN MADE
THRILLED EVERY NERVE AND MADE ABSOLUTE EXHAUSTION IMPOSSIBLE I SEEMED TO BE WALKING AND WALLOWING IN A CLOUD BUT HOLDING STEADILY ONWARD BY HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK I HAD GAINED THE HIGHEST SUMMIT
SETTLING SILENTLY IN THE DRY MOUNTAIN AIR OR MASSED IN FLAKES SOFT AND DOWNY TO LIE OUT ALONE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF A STILL NIGHT AND BE TOUCHED BY THE FIRST OF THESE SMALL SILENT MESSENGERS FROM THE SKY IS A MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE
EARTH AND SKY ROUND AND ROUND THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE WAS ONE RAVISHING REVELATION OF COLOR INFINITELY VARIED AND INTERBLENDED I HAVE SEEN MANY A GLORIOUS SUNSET BENEATH LIFTING STORM CLOUDS ON THE MOUNTAINS
AND OVER ALL THE SMOOTH CROWN OF SNOW WHILE STANDING AT THEIR FEET THE OTHER DAY SHORTLY AFTER MY MEMORABLE EXCURSION AMONG THE SALT WAVES OF THE LAKE I SAID NOW I SHALL HAVE ANOTHER BAPTISM
PRESENTING A MOST GLORIOUS MASS OF WINTER MOUNTAIN SCENERY IN THE MIDST OF WHICH I SCRAMBLED AND REVELED OR LAY SNUGLY SNOWBOUND ENJOYING THE FERTILE CLOUDS AND THE SNOW BLOOM IN ALL THEIR GROWING DRIFTING GRANDEUR
HALF PRAIRIE LEVEL AND FERTILE AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSIFIED WITH OUTSTANDING GROVES OF SPRUCES AND ALDERS AND RICH FLOWERY FRINGES OF SPIRAEA AND WILD ROSES THE RIVER MEANDERING DEEP AND TRANQUIL THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
THE STORM SIDE OF MY BLANKETS WAS FASTENED DOWN WITH STAKES TO REDUCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE SIFTING IN OF DRIFT AND THE DANGER OF BEING BLOWN AWAY THE PRECIOUS BREAD SACK WAS PLACED SAFELY AS A PILLOW AND WHEN AT LENGTH THE FIRST FLAKES FELL
THAT WE CARED BUT LITTLE ABOUT EATING BUT WE EAGERLY DRANK THE COFFEE HE PREPARED FOR US OUR FEET WERE FROZEN AND THAWING THEM WAS PAINFUL AND HAD TO BE DONE VERY SLOWLY BY KEEPING THEM BURIED IN SOFT SNOW FOR SEVERAL HOURS
AND OUR GLORIOUS MORNING IN THE SKY PROMISED NOTHING BUT ENJOYMENT AT NINE A M THE DRY THERMOMETER STOOD AT THIRTY FOUR DEGREES IN THE SHADE AND ROSE STEADILY UNTIL AT ONE P M IT STOOD AT FIFTY DEGREES
TURNING FROM RANGE TO RANGE STUDYING THE DARKENING SKY AND LISTENING TO THE STILL SMALL VOICES OF THE FLOWERS AT OUR FEET SOME OF THE DENSER CLOUDS CAME DOWN CROWNING AND WREATHING THE HIGHEST PEAKS AND DROPPING LONG GRAY FRINGES
THE FROST WAS INTENSE AND DRIFTING SNOW DUST MADE BREATHING AT TIMES RATHER DIFFICULT THE SNOW WAS AS DRY AS MEAL AND THE FINER PARTICLES DRIFTED FREELY RISING HIGH IN THE AIR WHILE THE LARGER PORTIONS OF THE CRYSTALS ROLLED LIKE SAND
THERE I COULD BUILD A STORM NEST AND LIE WARM AND MAKE RAIDS UP AND AROUND THE MOUNTAIN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WEATHER SETTING OUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER FIRST WITH JEROME FAY MOUNTAINEER AND GUIDE IN CHARGE OF THE ANIMALS
AS IF ATTRACTED BY THE RINGING OF THEIR BELLS THEY WERE GROWING IN A SMALL NESTLIKE OPENING BETWEEN THE ROCK AND THE BUSHES AND BOTH THE ERYTHRONIUM AND THE FRITILLARIA WERE IN FULL FLOWER THESE WERE THE FIRST OF THE SPECIES I HAD SEEN
AND FROM THE WINDOW I SAW THE GREAT WHITE SHASTA CONE CLAD IN FORESTS AND CLOUDS AND BEARING THEM LOFTILY IN THE SKY EVERYTHING SEEMED FULL AND RADIANT WITH THE FRESHNESS AND BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM OF YOUTH
THESE AT LENGTH UNITED WITH THE OLDER FIELD TOWARDS LASSEN'S BUTTE THUS ENCIRCLING MOUNT SHASTA IN ONE CONTINUOUS CLOUD ZONE RHETT AND KLAMATH LAKES WERE ECLIPSED BENEATH CLOUDS SCARCELY LESS BRILLIANT THAN THEIR OWN SILVERY DISKS
HE FIRMLY REFUSED TO MAKE THE VENTURE TO FIND THE CAMP WHILE I AWARE OF THE DANGERS THAT WOULD NECESSARILY ATTEND OUR EFFORTS AND CONSCIOUS OF BEING THE CAUSE OF HIS PRESENT PERIL DECIDED NOT TO LEAVE HIM OUR DISCUSSIONS ENDED
AND THE PATHWAYS OF VANISHED GLACIERS OF WHICH SHASTA HAD BEEN THE CENTER BUT AS I HAD LEFT MY COAT IN CAMP FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING MY LIMBS FREE IN CLIMBING I SOON WAS COLD THE WIND INCREASED IN VIOLENCE
THEREFORE HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND HIGH THE BRAG ASCENDING FROM PUGET SOUND IN MOST CASES IT IS LIKELY TO APPEAR PARDONABLE AND MORE SEATTLE WAS NAMED AFTER AN OLD INDIAN CHIEF WHO LIVED IN THIS PART OF THE SOUND
UNDULATING HILL AND DALE SMOOTH PURPLE PLAINS AND SILVERY MOUNTAINS OF CUMULI RANGE OVER RANGE DIVERSIFIED WITH PEAK AND DOME AND HOLLOW FULLY BROUGHT OUT IN LIGHT AND SHADE I GAZED ENCHANTED
ILL DEFINED EMBANKMENT FROM THE ICY MESHES OF WHICH SNOW FLOWERS BEGAN TO FALL ALTERNATING WITH HAIL THE SKY SPEEDILY DARKENED AND JUST AS I HAD COMPLETED MY LAST OBSERVATION AND BOXED MY INSTRUMENTS READY FOR THE DESCENT
MIGHT BE RAISED IN WASHINGTON FOR THE WANTS OF ALL THE WORLD BUT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PICKERS TO HANDLE THE CROP MOST OF THE PICKING IS DONE BY INDIANS AND TO THIS FINE CLEAN PROFITABLE WORK THEY COME IN GREAT NUMBERS IN THEIR CANOES OLD AND YOUNG
ON THE CONTRARY THEY IMPRESSED ONE AS BEING LASTING ADDITIONS TO THE LANDSCAPE THE WEATHER OF THE SPRINGTIME AND SUMMER THROUGHOUT THE SIERRA IN GENERAL IS USUALLY VARIED BY SLIGHT LOCAL RAINS AND DUSTINGS OF SNOW
AND WHEN THESE SEDIMENTS BECAME DRY LAND AND WERE BAKED AND CRUMBLED INTO THE SKY AS MOUNTAIN RANGES WHEN THE LAVA FLOODS OF THE FIRE PERIOD WERE BEING LAVISHLY POURED FORTH FROM INNUMERABLE RIFTS AND CRATERS
AT LENGTH AFTER THE TEMPERATURE WAS SOMEWHAT MITIGATED ON THIS MEMORABLE FIRST OF MAY WE AROSE AND BEGAN TO STRUGGLE HOMEWARD OUR FROZEN TROUSERS COULD SCARCELY BE MADE TO BEND AT THE KNEE AND WE WADED THE SNOW WITH DIFFICULTY
AND DECLARED THE ASCENT OF SHASTA BUTTE THROUGH LOOSE SNOW IMPOSSIBLE NEVERTHELESS BEFORE NOON OF THE SECOND OF NOVEMBER I WAS IN THE FROSTY AZURE OF THE UTMOST SUMMIT WHEN I ARRIVED AT SISSON'S EVERYTHING WAS QUIET
UNTIL NIGHT BEGINS TO DRAW NEAR AND LIKE FOREST SHADOWS THICKENS INTO DARKNESS AND HIS DAY IS DONE IN THESE WASHINGTON WILDS LIVING ALONE ALL SORTS OF MEN MAY PERCHANCE BE FOUND POETS PHILOSOPHERS
I WILL BATHE IN THE HIGH SKY AMONG COOL WIND WAVES FROM THE SNOW FROM THE MORE SOUTHERLY OF THE TWO PEAKS A LONG RIDGE COMES DOWN BENT LIKE A BOW ONE END IN THE HOT PLAINS THE OTHER IN THE SNOW OF THE SUMMIT
AS IF TO KNOW HOW THE WORK WAS ADVANCING DURING THESE CALM INTERVALS I REPLENISHED MY FIRE SOMETIMES WITHOUT LEAVING THE NEST FOR FIRE AND WOODPILE WERE SO NEAR THIS COULD EASILY BE DONE OR BUSIED MYSELF WITH MY NOTEBOOK
AND A FEW WEEDY LOOKING PATCHES OF SPRUCE AND FIR THE SIMPLICITY OF THEIR SLOPES PREVENTING THEIR REAL LOFTINESS FROM BEING APPRECIATED GRAY SAGEY PLAINS CIRCLE AROUND THEIR BASES AND UP TO A HEIGHT OF A THOUSAND FEET OR MORE THEIR SIDES ARE TINGED WITH PURPLE
SURELY NOTHING IN HEAVEN NOR ANY MANSION OF THE LORD IN ALL HIS WORLDS COULD BE MORE GLORIOUSLY CARPETED OTHER PORTIONS OF THE PLAIN WERE FLUSHED WITH RED AND PURPLE AND ALL THE MOUNTAINS AND THE CLOUDS ABOVE THEM WERE PAINTED IN CORRESPONDING LOVELINESS
HAS BEEN TRANSPLANTED TO THIS WILDERNESS WHERE SHE BLOOMS ALONE THE LILY OF SAN PITCH PITCH IS AN OLD INDIAN WHO I SUPPOSE PITCHED INTO THE SETTLERS AND THUS ACQUIRED FAME ENOUGH TO GIVE NAME TO THE VALLEY
THE MAJESTIC TREES OVERHEAD LEANING OVER THE BRINK LIKE LISTENERS EAGER TO CATCH EVERY WORD OF THE WHITE REFRESHING WATERS
AT THE SALMON HATCHING ESTABLISHMENT ON THE MC CLOUD RIVER I HALTED A WEEK TO EXAMINE THE LIMESTONE BELT GRANDLY DEVELOPED THERE TO LEARN WHAT I COULD OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE RIVER AND ITS BANKS
I WAS EXULTINGLY READY TO WELCOME THEM MOST OF MY FIREWOOD WAS MORE THAN HALF ROSIN AND WOULD BLAZE IN THE FACE OF THE FIERCEST DRIFTING THE WINDS COULD NOT DEMOLISH MY BED AND MY BREAD COULD BE MADE TO LAST INDEFINITELY
MAKING HIS WAY WITH THE SKILL OF WILD ANIMALS ALL HIS SENSES IN ACTION WATCHFUL AND ALERT LOOKING KEENLY AT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT HIS IMAGINATION WELL NOURISHED IN THE WEALTH OF THE WILDERNESS COMING INTO CONTACT WITH FREE NATURE IN A THOUSAND FORMS
SHINING WITH MARVELOUS BRIGHTNESS WITH LONG LANCE RAYS NEAR LOOKING AND NEW LOOKING AS IF NEVER SEEN BEFORE AGAIN THEY WOULD LOOK FAMILIAR AND REMIND US OF STARGAZING AT HOME OFTENTIMES IMAGINATION COMING INTO PLAY
EVEN AFTER THE STORM IS OVER WE SHALL HAVE TO WAIT FOR SUNSHINE AND WHEN WILL IT COME THE TEMPERED AREA TO WHICH WE HAD COMMITTED OURSELVES EXTENDED OVER ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF AN ACRE
THOUGH PERCHANCE THEY MIGHT BE SAUNTERING BY WITH LITTLE ELSE TO DO THAN CHAT WITH THEM POSSIBLY THERE MAY BE SALT LAKE FAMILIES SUFFICIENTLY PURE FOR ANGEL SOCIETY BUT I WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE RECEPTION THEY GAVE THE SMALL SNOW ANGELS THAT GOD SENT AMONG THEM THE OTHER NIGHT
NOR IN YOUR WALKS IN THE WOODS WILL YOU BE LIKELY TO SEE MANY OF THE WILD ANIMALS HOWEVER FAR YOU MAY GO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL AND THE MOUNTAIN GOAT THE SQUIRREL IS EVERYWHERE AND THE GOAT YOU CAN HARDLY FAIL TO FIND IF YOU CLIMB ANY OF THE HIGH MOUNTAINS THE DEER
HALF AN HOUR LATER WE HEARD SISSON SHOUTING DOWN AMONG THE FIRS COMING WITH HORSES TO TAKE US TO THE HOTEL AFTER BREAKING A TRAIL THROUGH THE SNOW AS FAR AS POSSIBLE HE HAD TIED HIS ANIMALS AND WALKED UP WE HAD BEEN SO LONG WITHOUT FOOD
I HELD MY COMMANDING FOOTHOLD IN THE SKY FOR TWO HOURS GAZING ON THE GLORIOUS LANDSCAPES SPREAD MAPLIKE AROUND THE IMMENSE HORIZON AND TRACING THE OUTLINES OF THE ANCIENT LAVA STREAMS EXTENDING FAR INTO THE SURROUNDING PLAINS
IN OUR FROZEN AND BROILED CONDITION SEEMED CERTAIN DEATH THE ACRID INCRUSTATIONS SUBLIMED FROM THE ESCAPING GASES FREQUENTLY GAVE WAY OPENING NEW VENTS TO SCALD US AND FEARING THAT IF AT ANY TIME THE WIND SHOULD FALL
HAVING SLEPT LITTLE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ASCENT AND BEING WEARY WITH CLIMBING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT WAS OVER I SLEPT LATE THEN AWAKING SUDDENLY MY EYES OPENED ON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SUBLIME SCENES I EVER ENJOYED A BOUNDLESS WILDERNESS OF STORM CLOUDS
AND I TOLD JEROME THAT WE TWO MOUNTAINEERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR WAY DOWN THROUGH ANY STORM LIKELY TO FALL PRESENTLY THIN FIBROUS FILMS OF CLOUD BEGAN TO BLOW DIRECTLY OVER THE SUMMIT FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
I FREQUENTLY SANK TO MY ARMPITS BETWEEN BURIED BLOCKS OF LOOSE LAVA BUT GENERALLY ONLY TO MY KNEES WHEN TIRED WITH WALKING I STILL WALLOWED SLOWLY UPWARD ON ALL FOURS THE STEEPNESS OF THE SLOPE
BUT ON GAINING THE SUMMIT WE SAW TOWARD LASSEN'S BUTTE HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES OF WHITE CUMULI BOILING DREAMILY IN THE SUNSHINE FAR BENEATH US AND CAUSING NO ALARM THE SLIGHT WEARINESS OF THE ASCENT WAS SOON RESTED AWAY
AND EVEN FULL BLOWN TRANSCENDENTALISTS THOUGH YOU MAY GO FAR TO FIND THEM INDIANS ARE SELDOM TO BE MET WITH AWAY FROM THE SOUND EXCEPTING ABOUT THE FEW OUTLYING HOP RANCHES TO WHICH THEY RESORT IN GREAT NUMBERS DURING THE PICKING SEASON
IN BLANK EXPOSURE TO THE DEEP UPPER CURRENTS OF THE SKY AND NO LABYRINTH OF PEAKS AND CANYONS I HAD EVER BEEN IN SEEMED TO ME SO DANGEROUS AS THESE IMMENSE SLOPES BARE AGAINST THE SKY
AND AT THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FEET I CAME UPON THE FRESH TRAIL OF A FLOCK OF WILD SHEEP SHOWING THAT THESE FINE MOUNTAINEERS STILL FLOURISH HERE ABOVE THE RANGE OF MORMON RIFLES IN THE PLANTING OF HER WILD GARDENS
AND SHED A BLAZE OF LIGHT ON THE WILD LAVA SLOPE AND THE STRAGGLING STORM BENT PINES AROUND US MELTED SNOW ANSWERED FOR COFFEE AND WE HAD PLENTY OF VENISON TO ROAST TOWARD MIDNIGHT I ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS SLEPT AN HOUR AND A HALF
HERE I FEEL UNEASY ABOUT THE NAME OF THIS LILY FOR THE COMPOSITORS HAVE A PERVERSE TRICK OF MAKING ME SAY ALL KINDS OF ABSURD THINGS WHOLLY UNWARRANTED BY PLAIN COPY AND I FEAR THAT THE LILY OF SAN PITCH WILL APPEAR IN PRINT AS THE WIDOW OF SAM PATCH
SET IN A ROMANTIC DELL THATCHED WITH DRIPPING MOSSES AND FERNS AND EMBOWERED IN DENSE EVERGREENS AND BLOOMING BUSHES
WIND RAIN AND SNOW FILLED THE WHOLE BASIN DRIVING WILDLY OVER VALLEY AND PLAIN FROM RANGE TO RANGE BESTOWING THEIR BENEFACTIONS IN MOST CORDIAL AND HARMONIOUS STORM MEASURES
OUR FEEBLENESS ACCELERATING RATHER THAN DIMINISHING OUR SPEED WHEN WE HAD DESCENDED SOME THREE THOUSAND FEET THE SUNSHINE WARMED OUR BACKS AND WE BEGAN TO REVIVE AT TEN A M WE REACHED THE TIMBER AND WERE SAFE
EVEN SHOULD HIS SUFFERINGS ADMIT OF SUCH A THING ACCORDINGLY WHEN DURING THE LONG DREARY WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WE ROUSED FROM A STATE OF HALF CONSCIOUSNESS WE CALLED EACH OTHER BY NAME IN A FRIGHTENED STARTLED WAY
WHEN THE BLOOM OF THE SHASTA CHAPARRAL IS FALLING THE GROUND IS SOMETIMES COVERED FOR HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES TO A DEPTH OF HALF AN INCH BUT THE BLOOM OF THIS FERTILE SNOW CLOUD GREW AND MATURED AND FELL TO A DEPTH OF TWO FEET IN A FEW HOURS
AS ONE STROLLS IN THE WOODS ABOUT THE LOGGING CAMPS MOST OF THE LUMBERMEN ARE FOUND TO BE INTERESTING PEOPLE TO MEET KIND AND OBLIGING AND SINCERE FULL OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE BARK AND SAPWOOD AND HEARTWOOD OF THE TREES THEY CUT AND HOW TO FELL THEM WITHOUT UNNECESSARY BREAKAGE
A DOUGLAS SQUIRREL CAME FRISKING FROM THE FOOT OF A CLUMP OF DWARF PINES MOVING IN SUDDEN INTERRUPTED SPURTS OVER THE BOSSY SNOW THEN WITHOUT ANY APPARENT GUIDANCE HE WOULD DIG RAPIDLY INTO THE DRIFT WHERE WERE BURIED SOME GRAINS OF BARLEY THAT THE HORSES HAD LEFT
HE WAS VERY PROUD OF THE HONOR AND LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO LEAD HIS GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT THE STREETS THE GREATER PART OF THE LOWER BUSINESS PORTION OF THE TOWN INCLUDING A LONG STRETCH OF WHARVES AND WAREHOUSES BUILT ON PILES
THAT NOW SMOULDERS NOW BRIGHTENS AND MAY BE EASILY QUENCHED THE WEARY HOURS WORE AWAY LIKE DIM HALF FORGOTTEN YEARS SO LONG AND EVENTFUL THEY SEEMED THOUGH WE DID NOTHING BUT SUFFER
HUNGRY AT TIMES AND WEARY HE HAS CORRESPONDING ENJOYMENT IN EATING AND RESTING AND ALL THE WILDERNESS IS HOME SOME OF THESE RARE HAPPY ROVERS DIE ALONE AMONG THE LEAVES
WHERE NEVER A DUST PARTICLE FLOATED AND WHERE ALL THE FLOWERS FRESH WITH MIST AND SPRAY ARE WETTER THAN WATER LILIES THE POOL AT THE FOOT OF THE FALL IS A PLACE SURPASSINGLY LOVELY TO LOOK AT WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC RUSH AND SONG OF THE FALLS
THE SNOW OF COURSE GROWING STEADILY DEEPER AND LOOSER SO THAT WE HAD TO BREAK A TRAIL THE ANIMALS BEGAN TO GET DISCOURAGED AND AFTER NIGHT AND DARKNESS CAME ON THEY BECAME ENTANGLED IN A BED OF ROUGH LAVA
AFTER CAREFULLY SCANNING THE JAGGED TOWERS AND BATTLEMENTS WITH WHICH IT IS ROUGHENED I DETERMINED TO MAKE IT MY WAY THOUGH IT PRESENTED BUT A FEEBLE ADVERTISEMENT OF ITS FLORAL WEALTH THIS APPARENT BARRENNESS HOWEVER MADE NO GREAT OBJECTION JUST THEN
SEEMED TO TOUCH ONE ANOTHER AND FAIRLY TO THICKEN THE TREMENDOUS BLAST THAT CARRIED THEM THIS WAS THE BLOOM TIME THE SUMMER OF THE CLOUD AND NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN EVEN A MOUNTAIN CLOUD FLOWERING SO PROFUSELY
MIGHT COLLECT IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO CAUSE SLEEP AND DEATH
WE MIGHT HAVE MADE GOOD OUR ESCAPE HOWEVER DARK AND WILD THE STORM AS IT WAS WE HAD FIRST TO MAKE OUR WAY ALONG A DANGEROUS RIDGE NEARLY A MILE AND A HALF LONG FLANKED IN MANY PLACES BY STEEP ICE SLOPES AT THE HEAD OF THE WHITNEY GLACIER ON ONE SIDE
IN THE MEAN TIME CLOUDS WERE GROWING DOWN IN SHASTA VALLEY MASSIVE SWELLING CUMULI DISPLAYING DELICIOUS TONES OF PURPLE AND GRAY IN THE HOLLOWS OF THEIR SUN BEATEN BOSSES EXTENDING GRADUALLY SOUTHWARD AROUND ON BOTH SIDES OF SHASTA
THEY ARE COVERED WITH COMMON SUNSHINE DOWN HERE ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN LARKS AND REDWINGS ARE SWINGING ON THE RUSHES THE BALMY AIR IS INSTINCT WITH IMMORTAL LIFE THE WILD FLOWERS THE GRASS
THE PEOPLE HOWEVER ARE IN NO WISE DISCOURAGED AND ERE LONG THE LOSS WILL BE GAIN INASMUCH AS A BETTER CLASS OF BUILDINGS CHIEFLY OF BRICK ARE BEING ERECTED IN PLACE OF THE INFLAMMABLE WOODEN ONES WHICH WITH COMPARATIVELY FEW EXCEPTIONS WERE BUILT OF PITCHY SPRUCE
WITH BILLOWS OF DUST AND SAND
AND THESE TWO ARE KEEN ACTIVE RIVALS TO ALL APPEARANCES WELL MATCHED TACOMA OCCUPIES NEAR THE HEAD OF THE SOUND A SITE OF GREAT NATURAL BEAUTY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD AND CALLS ITSELF THE CITY OF DESTINY
IN WHICH WE FANCIED WE SAW DRY RESINOUS LOGS SUITABLE FOR CAMPFIRES JUST AS AFTER GOING DAYS WITHOUT FOOD MEN FANCY THEY SEE BREAD FROZEN BLISTERED FAMISHED BENUMBED OUR BODIES SEEMED LOST TO US AT TIMES
EVEN ROSES AND LILIES IN GARDENS MOST LOVED ARE TAINTED WITH A THOUSAND IMPURITIES AS SOON AS THEY UNFOLD I HEARD BRIGHAM YOUNG IN THE TABERNACLE THE OTHER DAY WARNING HIS PEOPLE THAT IF THEY DID NOT MEND THEIR MANNERS ANGELS WOULD NOT COME INTO THEIR HOUSES

HE SAID THEY ARE NICE
THE ROAD LEADS THROUGH MAJESTIC WOODS WITH FERNS TEN FEET HIGH BENEATH SOME OF THE THICKETS AND ACROSS A GRAVELLY PLAIN DEFORESTED BY FIRE MANY YEARS AGO ORANGE LILIES ARE PLENTIFUL
A WEAVING OF TRANSLUCENT TISSUE ABOVE THEN THE ROAR OF THE WIND AND THE THUNDER AND THE DARKENING FLIGHT OF SNOW ITS SUBSIDENCE WAS NOT LESS SUDDEN THE CLOUDS BROKE AND VANISHED NOT A CRYSTAL WAS LEFT IN THE SKY
EXCITED OUR ATTENTION WITHOUT ENABLING US TO DECIDE CERTAINLY AS TO ITS CHARACTER BUT WE WERE NOT LEFT LONG IN DOUBT FOR IN A FEW MINUTES IT CAME SWEEPING OVER THE VALLEY IN A WILD UPROAR A TORRENT OF WIND THICK WITH SAND AND DUST
THE SNOW WAS TOO LOOSE AND DEEP TO CLIMB AND I SHOULD BE LOST IN DRIFTS AND SLIDES WHEN I HINTED THAT NEW SNOW WAS BEAUTIFUL AND STORMS NOT SO BAD AS THEY WERE CALLED MY ADVISERS SHOOK THEIR HEADS IN TOKEN OF SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
TWO LILIACEOUS PLANTS IN PARTICULAR ERYTHRONIUM GRANDIFLORUM AND FRITILLARIA PUDICA ARE MARVELOUSLY BEAUTIFUL AND ABUNDANT
A SPRUCE AND A FIR STANDING CLOSE TOGETHER ERECT AND ARROWY IN A THRIFTY COMPACT GROWTH BUT THEY ARE QUITE SMALL SAY FROM SIX TO TWELVE OR FOURTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER AND BOUT FORTY FEET IN HEIGHT AMONG THEIR GIANT RELATIVES OF THE SIERRA
AND THE PASSIONATE UPROAR PRODUCED A GLAD EXCITEMENT DAY AFTER DAY THE STORM CONTINUED PILING SNOW ON SNOW IN WEARILESS ABUNDANCE
SEATTLE IS ALSO CHARMINGLY LOCATED ABOUT TWENTY MILES DOWN THE SOUND FROM TACOMA ON ELLIOTT BAY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE SEATTLE LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILROAD NOW IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND CALLS ITSELF THE QUEEN CITY OF THE SOUND
TO LET JEROME WHO HAD FALLEN A LITTLE BEHIND COME UP HERE HE OPENED A COUNCIL IN WHICH UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EXCITING BUT WITHOUT EVINCING ANY BEWILDERMENT HE MAINTAINED IN OPPOSITION TO MY VIEWS THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED
RAILROADS AND MILLS IN THE OPENING OF MINES OF COAL AND IRON AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN GENERAL TO MANY ESPECIALLY IN THE ATLANTIC STATES WASHINGTON IS HARDLY KNOWN AT ALL IT IS REGARDED AS BEING YET A FAR WILD WEST
WHERE BREAKING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE FEET OF MEALY SNOW THEIR FEET WERE CAUGHT BETWEEN ANGULAR BOULDERS HERE THEY WERE IN DANGER OF BEING LOST BUT AFTER WE HAD REMOVED PACKS AND SADDLES AND ASSISTED THEIR EFFORTS WITH ROPES
AND TO GIVE TIME FOR THE FRESH SNOW THAT I KNEW HAD FALLEN ON THE MOUNTAIN TO SETTLE SOMEWHAT WITH A VIEW TO MAKING THE ASCENT A PEDESTRIAN ON THESE MOUNTAIN ROADS ESPECIALLY SO LATE IN THE YEAR IS SURE TO EXCITE CURIOSITY
TRAILED THEIR LUSTROUS FRINGES THROUGH THE PINES AS IF TAKING A LAST VIEW OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHED WORK THEN CAME DARKNESS AND THE GLORIOUS DAY WAS DONE
AND ALONG THE RIVERS WHILE SALMON ARE GOING UP TO SPAWN THE BLACK BEAR MAY BE FOUND FAT AND AT HOME MANY ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BOTH FOR THEIR FLESH AND SKINS THE LARGE BROWN SPECIES LIKES HIGHER AND OPENER GROUND
BUT YOU MAY NOT SEE A SINGLE TRUE LILY AND ONLY A VERY FEW LILIACEOUS PLANTS OF ANY KIND NOT EVEN IN THE COOL FRESH GLENS OF THE MOUNTAINS WILL YOU FIND THESE FAVORITE FLOWERS THOUGH SOME OF THESE DESERT RANGES ALMOST RIVAL THE SIERRA IN HEIGHT
BUILDING BUYING BORROWING TO PUSH THE COUNTRY TO ITS PLACE KEEPING ARITHMETIC BUSY IN COUNTING POPULATION PRESENT AND TO COME SHIPS TOWNS FACTORIES TONS OF COAL AND IRON FEET OF LUMBER MILES OF RAILROAD
AND THE FROSTS AND THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING SO LATE IN THE YEAR THEREFORE I COULD NOT ASK A GUIDE TO GO WITH ME EVEN HAD ONE BEEN WILLING ALL I WANTED WAS TO HAVE BLANKETS AND PROVISIONS DEPOSITED AS FAR UP IN THE TIMBER AS THE SNOW WOULD PERMIT A PACK ANIMAL TO GO
ON THE UPPER SIDE WHERE THE BUSHES WERE MORE OPEN BUT A COMPANY COMPOSED OF THE TWO LILIES I HAVE MENTIONED WERE BLOOMING ON THE LOWER SIDE AND THOUGH THEY WERE AS YET OUT OF SIGHT I SUDDENLY CHANGED MY MIND AND WENT DOWN TO MEET THEM
THE FIRST RAINS HAD FALLEN ON THE LOWLANDS AND THE FIRST SNOWS ON THE MOUNTAINS AND EVERYTHING WAS FRESH AND BRACING WHILE AN ABUNDANCE OF BALMY SUNSHINE FILLED ALL THE NOONDAY HOURS
AND IN MANY PLACES REACHED THE SKIN WE WERE GLAD AT FIRST TO SEE THE SNOW PACKING ABOUT US HOPING IT WOULD DEADEN THE FORCE OF THE WIND BUT IT SOON FROZE INTO A STIFF CRUSTY HEAP AS THE TEMPERATURE FELL RATHER AUGMENTING OUR NOVEL MISERY
PAVED BROADWAYS AND BOULEVARDS SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS BLOCKS SCHOOLS CHURCHES FACTORIES AND FOUNDRIES THE LUSTY TITANIC CLANG OF BOILER MAKING MAY BE HEARD THERE
WERE MARSHALING THEMSELVES ALONG THE MOUNTAIN TOPS AND SENDING OUT LONG OVERLAPPING WINGS ACROSS THE VALLEY AND EVEN WHERE NO CLOUD WAS VISIBLE AN OBSCURING FILM ABSORBED THE SUNLIGHT GIVING RISE TO A COLD BLUISH DARKNESS NEVERTHELESS
TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE BY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND SWIMMING TO THE ISLANDS OFF SHORE THE ELK AND PERHAPS ALSO THE MOOSE STILL EXIST IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE SOLITUDES OF THE FOREST BUT THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GREATLY REDUCED OF LATE
AND HOUR AFTER HOUR PASSED BY WHILE WE EAGERLY WATCHED THE PALE LIGHT STEALING DOWN THE RIDGE TO THE HOLLOW WHERE WE LAY BUT THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF THAT WARM FLUSHING SUNRISE SPLENDOR WE SO LONG HAD HOPED FOR
RAISING THE SNOW IN MAGNIFICENT DRIFTS THAT WERE DRAWN OUT IN THE FORM OF WAVERING BANNERS BLOWING IN THE SUN TOWARD THE END OF MY STAY A SUCCESSION OF SMALL CLOUDS STRUCK AGAINST THE SUMMIT ROCKS LIKE DRIFTING ICEBERGS
A PERILOUS NIGHT ON SHASTA'S SUMMIT TOWARD THE END OF SUMMER AFTER A LIGHT OPEN WINTER ONE MAY REACH THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT SHASTA WITHOUT PASSING OVER MUCH SNOW BY KEEPING ON THE CREST OF A LONG NARROW RIDGE
AND HANDSOME SHINING MATS OF THE KINNIKINIC SPRINKLED WITH BRIGHT SCARLET BERRIES FROM A PLACE CALLED HUNT'S AT THE END OF THE WAGON ROAD A TRAIL LEADS THROUGH LUSH DRIPPING WOODS NEVER DRY
AND PLENTY OF THE LANGUID MUSIC OF PIANOS MINGLING WITH THE BABEL NOISES OF COMMERCE CARRIED ON IN A HUNDRED TONGUES THE MAIN STREETS ARE CROWDED WITH BRIGHT WIDE AWAKE LAWYERS MINISTERS MERCHANTS AGENTS FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN
NEVERTHELESS IN THE BUILDING AND PLANTING OF THIS GRAND TERRITORY THE LILIES WERE NOT FORGOTTEN FAR BACK IN THE DIM GEOLOGIC AGES WHEN THE SEDIMENTS OF THE OLD SEAS WERE BEING GATHERED AND OUTSPREAD IN SMOOTH SHEETS LIKE LEAVES OF A BOOK
WHILE SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AT STRAWBERRY VALLEY JEROME PEERED AT SHORT INTERVALS OVER THE RIDGE CONTEMPLATING THE RISING CLOUDS WITH ANXIOUS GESTURES IN THE ROUGH WIND AND AT LENGTH DECLARED THAT IF WE DID NOT MAKE A SPEEDY ESCAPE
ALMOST EVERY OTHER DAY DURING THE LAST THREE WEEKS SMALL LOCAL STORMS HAVE BEEN FALLING ON THE WAHSATCH AND OQUIRRH MOUNTAINS WHILE THE JORDAN VALLEY REMAINED DRY AND SUN FILLED BUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THURSDAY THE SEVENTEENTH ULTIMO
ASSUMING A VIOLENCE AND ENERGY OF EXPRESSION SCARCELY SURPASSED BY THOSE BRED IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER SUCH WAS THE STORM NOW GATHERING ABOUT US IT BEGAN TO DECLARE ITSELF SHORTLY AFTER NOON
WHICH AVOIDED PERMANENT DAMAGE FIVE THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE SUMMIT WE FOUND ONLY THREE INCHES OF NEW SNOW AND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN ONLY A SLIGHT SHOWER OF RAIN HAD FALLEN SHOWING HOW LOCAL OUR STORM HAD BEEN
I REACHED CAMP ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE DUSK HOLLOWED A STRIP OF LOOSE GROUND IN THE LEE OF A LARGE BLOCK OF RED LAVA WHERE FIREWOOD WAS ABUNDANT ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS AND WENT TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING
THEY ALL ESCAPED TO THE SIDE OF A RIDGE ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE TIMBERLINE TO GO FARTHER WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION SO WE WERE COMPELLED TO CAMP AS BEST WE COULD A PITCH PINE FIRE SPEEDILY CHANGED THE TEMPERATURE
THE WIND SWEPT PAST IN HISSING FLOODS GRINDING THE SNOW INTO MEAL AND SWEEPING DOWN INTO THE HOLLOWS IN ENORMOUS DRIFTS ALL THE HEAVIER PARTICLES WHILE THE FINER DUST WAS SIFTED THROUGH THE SKY INCREASING THE ICY GLOOM
THE STORM BEGAN IN SERIOUS EARNEST AT FIRST THE CLIFFS WERE BEATEN WITH HAIL EVERY STONE OF WHICH AS FAR AS I COULD SEE WAS REGULAR IN FORM SIX SIDED PYRAMIDS WITH ROUNDED BASE RICH AND SUMPTUOUS LOOKING AND FASHIONED WITH LOVING CARE
YOU MAY WALK THE DESERTS OF THE GREAT BASIN IN THE BLOOM TIME OF THE YEAR ALL THE WAY ACROSS FROM THE SNOWY SIERRA TO THE SNOWY WAHSATCH AND YOUR EYES WILL BE FILLED WITH MANY A GAY MALVA AND POPPY AND ABRONIA AND CACTUS
LOOKING SOUTHWARD FROM THE SOUTH END OF SALT LAKE THE TWO NORTHMOST PEAKS OF THE OQUIRRH RANGE ARE SEEN SWELLING CALMLY INTO THE COOL SKY WITHOUT ANY MARKED CHARACTER EXCEPTING ONLY THEIR SNOW CROWNS
FOR TO IT HUNDREDS OF THEM OWE THEIR LIVES DURING THE FAMINE YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT GREAT DESTITUTION PREVAILED ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN SETTLEMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF DROUTH AND GRASSHOPPERS
AND HE MUST SURELY HAVE PERISHED AND SISSON WAS BLAMED FOR ALLOWING ANY ONE TO ATTEMPT CLIMBING IN SUCH WEATHER WHILE I WAS AS SAFE AS ANYBODY IN THE LOWLANDS LYING LIKE A SQUIRREL IN A WARM FLUFFY NEST BUSIED ABOUT MY OWN AFFAIRS AND WISHING ONLY TO BE LET ALONE
AND I NEED NOT TRY TO TELL THE JOY THEY MADE THEY ARE BOTH LOWLY PLANTS LOWLY AS VIOLETS THE TALLEST SELDOM EXCEEDING SIX INCHES IN HEIGHT SO THAT THE MOST SEARCHING WINDS THAT SWEEP THE MOUNTAINS SCARCE REACH LOW ENOUGH TO SHAKE THEIR BELLS
AND THREE OR FOUR HANDSOME ALLIUMS ONE OF THESE LILIES THE CALOCHORTUS SEVERAL SPECIES OF WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN IN CALIFORNIA AS THE MARIPOSA TULIPS HAS RECEIVED GREAT CONSIDERATION AT THE HANDS OF THE MORMONS
THE SUMMIT RIDGE WAS FORTUNATELY WIND SWEPT AND NEARLY BARE SO WE WERE NOT COMPELLED TO LIFT OUR FEET HIGH AND ON REACHING THE LONG HOME SLOPES LADEN WITH LOOSE SNOW WE MADE RAPID PROGRESS SLIDING AND SHUFFLING AND PITCHING HEADLONG
I SAW AND FELT STILL MORE OF THE SHASTA SNOW FOR THEN IT WAS MY FORTUNE TO GET INTO THE VERY HEART OF A STORM AND TO BE HELD IN IT FOR A LONG TIME ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE
STILL THE PAIN WAS NOT ALWAYS OF THAT BITTER INTENSE KIND THAT PRECLUDES THOUGHT AND TAKES AWAY ALL CAPACITY FOR ENJOYMENT A SORT OF DREAMY STUPOR CAME ON AT TIMES
I MIGHT AT THIS MOMENT BEAT YOU OR KILL YOU FOR A FAIRY IS GREATER THAN A MAN THE ADVANTAGE OF POSSESSING A GREAT EMPIRE IS NOT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE EVIL THAT ONE DESIRES BUT TO DO ALL THE GOOD THAT ONE POSSIBLY CAN
AND AS MANY ELEGIES MADRIGALS AND SONGS WHICH WERE SENT HER BY ALL THE POETS IN THE WORLD
BUT IF YOU LIKE I WILL GO WITH YOU TO THE SOUTH WIND
THAT HE COVERED IT WITH PLATES OF GOLD AND THE FARMHOUSE LAY CLOSE BY THE SEA SHORE SO IT SHONE AND GLITTERED FAR OUT TO SEA
YOU HAD BETTER BE ACCUSED OF THAT BY YOUR SUBJECTS
AND THEN YOU CAN RIDE ON IT TO AN OLD WOMAN WHO IS A NEIGHBOR OF MINE
I MUST MAKE UP MY MIND TO DIE SAID THE POOR QUEEN ALAS I SHOULD NOT CARE SO MUCH IF ONLY MY DEAR DAUGHTER WERE MARRIED OH YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER CRIED THE YELLOW DWARF
COMING ALONG THE ROAD SHE RAN IN AND TELLED THE AULD WIFE WHAT SHE SAW AWEEL QUO THE AULD WIFE YON'S FOR YOU SAE THEY TOOK HER INTO THE COACH AND GALLOPED AFF
ONE DAY HOWEVER HE WENT OUT HUNTING BUT COULD GET NO SPORT WHICH PUT HIM IN A VERY BAD TEMPER IT SEEMED TO HIM AS HE RODE ALONG THAT HIS RING WAS PRESSING INTO HIS FINGER BUT AS IT DID NOT PRICK HIM HE DID NOT HEED IT WHEN HE GOT HOME AND WENT TO HIS OWN ROOM
AND THIS MADE PRINCE DARLING SO CROSS THAT HE GAVE HER QUITE A HARD KICK INSTANTLY HIS RING PRICKED HIM SHARPLY
PRAY GET DOWN AND GIVE ME A DRINK FROM MY GOLDEN CUP FOR SHE HAD LONG AGO FORGOTTEN HER MAID'S RUDE WORDS
BUT GOT ON BOARD HIS SHIP AS FAST AS HE COULD WHEN HE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY OUT TO SEA HE TOOK THE MILL ON DECK GRIND SALT AND GRIND BOTH QUICKLY AND WELL SAID THE SKIPPER SO THE MILL
AND WEST OF THE MOON AND THERE TOO IS A PRINCESS WITH A NOSE WHICH IS THREE ELLS LONG
AND NEVER TRIED TO CORRECT ANY OF HER FAULTS THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THIS LITTLE PERSON WHO WAS AS PRETTY AS POSSIBLE AND WAS ONE DAY TO WEAR A CROWN
BELLISSIMA IS PRETTY ENOUGH BUT I DON'T PARTICULARLY WANT TO MARRY HER YOU CAN KEEP HER OH NOBLE SIR SAID THE QUEEN IN GREAT DISTRESS DO NOT REFUSE HER
FROM THE WINDOWS BUT WHAT SEEMED VERY STRANGE WAS THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE WERE PALE AND THIN AND THEIR CLOTHES WERE TORN AND HANGING IN RAGS ABOUT THEM SOME FELL DOWN DEAD AS THEY CAME OUT BEFORE THEY HAD TIME TO GET AWAY OTHERS CRAWLED FARTHER WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY
AND SECRETLY PROMISED HIM A PIECE OF GOLD IF HE WOULD DO SOMETHING FOR HER THERE WAS IN THE TOWN A LARGE DARK GATE THROUGH WHICH SHE HAD TO PASS NIGHT AND MORNING WITH THE GEESE WOULD HE KINDLY HANG UP FALADA'S HEAD THERE THAT SHE MIGHT SEE IT ONCE AGAIN
HIS LITTLE DOG BIBI RAN TO MEET HIM JUMPING ROUND HIM WITH PLEASURE GET AWAY SAID THE PRINCE QUITE GRUFFLY I DON'T WANT YOU YOU ARE IN THE WAY THE POOR LITTLE DOG WHO DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS AT ALL PULLED AT HIS COAT TO MAKE HIM AT LEAST LOOK AT HER
NOW WHEN THEY HAD EATEN AND DRUNK AND WERE MERRY THE OLD KING ASKED THE WAITING MAID TO SOLVE A KNOTTY POINT FOR HIM
SO HE HAD COME THERE WITH HER AND WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IF THE WEST WIND KNEW WHEREABOUT THE CASTLE WAS
SAID SHE OPENING THE WINDOW IT CAN'T BE BOUGHT EITHER FOR GOLD OR MONEY ANSWERED THE GIRL
WITH ALL MY HEART ANSWERED THE FAIRY I CAN MAKE YOUR SON THE HANDSOMEST PRINCE IN THE WORLD OR THE RICHEST OR THE MOST POWERFUL CHOOSE WHICHEVER YOU LIKE FOR HIM I DO NOT ASK EITHER OF THESE THINGS FOR MY SON REPLIED THE GOOD KING BUT IF YOU WILL MAKE HIM THE BEST OF PRINCES
AND THEN I WILL SAY THAT NO ONE SHALL EVER BE MY BRIDE BUT THE WOMAN WHO CAN DO THIS AND I KNOW THAT YOU
FOR SHE LOVED HER DAUGHTER VERY DEARLY SHE GAVE HER A WAITING MAID ALSO WHO WAS TO RIDE WITH HER AND HAND HER OVER TO THE BRIDEGROOM AND SHE PROVIDED EACH OF THEM WITH A HORSE FOR THE JOURNEY NOW THE PRINCESS'S HORSE WAS CALLED FALADA AND COULD SPEAK
BUT IF I SELL IT I WILL HAVE THE HAND MILL WHICH IS STANDING THERE BEHIND THE DOOR AT FIRST THEY WOULD NOT HEAR OF THIS AND HAGGLED AND BARGAINED WITH THE MAN BUT HE STUCK TO WHAT HE HAD SAID
THE PRINCE SAW HOW NAUGHTY HE HAD BEEN AND PROMISED TO TRY AND DO BETTER IN FUTURE BUT HE DID NOT KEEP HIS WORD THE FACT WAS HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP BY A FOOLISH NURSE WHO HAD SPOILED HIM WHEN HE WAS LITTLE
LIGHTEN MY SORROW WITH SOFT TEARS ALAS ALAS I SEE NO MORE MY LOVE WHO YET MY SADNESS CHEERS AND THOU O RAGING STORMY SEA
AND THE STRANGER DAMOSEL WAS DISTRACTED AT THE THOUGHT OF IT FOR SHE WAS DEEPLY IN LOVE WI HIM SO SHE BETHOUGHT HER OF HER APPLE AND BREAKING IT FOUND IT FILLED WITH GOLD AND PRECIOUS JEWELRY
SHE THOUGHT THAT IF SHE CARRIED HIM OFF TO SOME FRIGHTFUL CAVERN AND CHAINED HIM TO A ROCK THEN THE FEAR OF DEATH WOULD MAKE HIM FORGET BELLISSIMA AND BECOME HER SLAVE SO AS SOON AS THEY REACHED THE PLACE
MESSENGERS WERE SENT TO ALL THE GAYEST AND MOST REFINED COURTS
AND PERHAPS HE CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW
TELLING HER NO TO BREAK IT TILL SHE WAS IN THE GREATEST STRAIT MORTAL COULD BE IN AND THAT WAD GET HER OUT O'T PRESENTLY THEY BROUGHT HAME THE BULL SET THE LADY ON HIS BACK AND AWA THEY WENT
AND VERY SOON KILLED IT AND THEN CAME AND CROUCHED AT THE FEET OF THE MAN IT HAD SAVED OVERCOME WITH GRATITUDE THE KEEPER STOOPED TO CARESS THE STRANGE CREATURE WHICH HAD DONE HIM SUCH A GREAT SERVICE BUT SUDDENLY A VOICE SAID IN HIS EAR A GOOD ACTION SHOULD NEVER GO UNREWARDED
BUT THEY HAD HARDLY TAKEN THEIR PLACES FACING ONE ANOTHER AND THE WHOLE COURT HAD ONLY JUST HAD TIME TO RUSH OUT UPON THE BALCONIES TO WATCH WHAT WAS GOING ON
AND HOW AFTER A TIME THE MAIDEN SAT DOWN AND LOOSED HER HAIR THAT GLITTERED LIKE GOLD AND REPEATED WIND WIND GENTLY SWAY BLOW CURDKEN'S HAT AWAY LET HIM CHASE O'ER FIELD AND WOLD
FOR I'M GAUN AWA TO SEEK MY FORTUNE HER MITHER DID SAE AND THE DOCHTER GAED AWA TO AN AULD WITCH WASHERWIFE AND TELLED HER PURPOSE THE AULD WIFE BADE HER STAY THAT DAY
OUT OF CHARITY I WILL TAKE HER BUT BE SURE AND DON'T FORGET THAT SHE IS MINE AS HE SPOKE A LITTLE DOOR OPENED IN THE TRUNK OF THE ORANGE TREE
AND HER MOTHER WHO WAS GETTING REALLY ANGRY AT HER DETERMINATION NOT TO BE MARRIED BEGAN TO WISH THAT SHE HAD NOT ALLOWED HER TO HAVE HER OWN WAY SO MUCH AT LAST NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO DO
HE WAS LED AWAY BY FLATTERERS I KNEW HIS HEART AND AM CERTAIN THAT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE BAD INFLUENCE OF THOSE WHO SURROUNDED HIM HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD KING AND A FATHER TO HIS PEOPLE WE MAY HATE HIS FAULTS
HE SAW HIS BELOVED PRINCESS IN A CASTLE BUILT OF POLISHED STEEL THE WALLS OF WHICH REFLECTED THE SUN'S RAYS SO HOTLY THAT NO ONE COULD APPROACH IT WITHOUT BEING BURNT TO A CINDER
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HER PRETTY ONE SAID THE LITTLE MONSTER FOR I AM A FRIEND OF HERS AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT I AM QUITE AS CLEVER AS SHE IS THE QUEEN MY MOTHER REPLIED THE PRINCESS
AND ENCOURAGED HIM IN ALL HIS EVIL WAYS WHEN HE SAW THE PRINCE SO DOWNCAST HE ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER
THROWING OFF THE HERMIT'S ROBE IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN DISGUISED AND APPEARING BEFORE THEM CELIA HAS LOVED YOU EVER SINCE SHE FIRST SAW YOU ONLY SHE WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHILE YOU WERE SO OBSTINATE AND NAUGHTY
THE WHITE BEAR ASKED HER IF EVERYTHING HAD NOT HAPPENED JUST AS HE HAD FORETOLD AND SHE COULD NOT BUT OWN THAT IT HAD THEN IF YOU HAVE DONE WHAT YOUR MOTHER WISHED
SAE GLAD WAS SHE THAT HER COMPANION WAS VICTORIOUS THE BULL RETURNED AND SOUGHT FOR BUT NEVER COULD FIND HER LANG SHE SAT AND AYE SHE GRAT
BUT JUST AS THEY PASSED SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW THE KING AND THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT NOW THE FAIRY WAS SO CLEVER THAT SHE COULD NOT ONLY SEEM BEAUTIFUL TO THE KING BUT EVEN THE POOR PRINCESS THOUGHT HER THE MOST LOVELY BEING SHE HAD EVER SEEN
AND HE PROCEEDED TO RELATE THE WHOLE STORY
AND THE MAN TAKING HIM UP IN HIS ARMS CARRIED HIM TO THE KING
YOU HESITATE MADAM CRIED THE DWARF
LIKE GIANTS MOUNTAINS HIGH AND FIRE FLEW FROM THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS UNTIL THEY LOOKED LIKE FLAMING FURNACES NONE OF THESE THINGS COULD TERRIFY THE NOBLE YOUNG KING AND THE BOLDNESS OF HIS LOOKS AND ACTIONS REASSURED THOSE WHO WERE LOOKING ON
REFUSE TO AID BELLISSIMA DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASKING SAID THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT FROWNING AND LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY DO YOU WANT ME TO EMPLOY MY ART AGAINST THE YELLOW DWARF WHO IS MY BEST FRIEND
TAKE CARE THAT YOU ARE NOT DROWNED IN THE POTTAGE HE CRIED AS HE WENT BY THEM AS IF MISCHIEF WERE AT HIS HEELS DOWN TO WHERE HIS BROTHER DWELT THEN HE BEGGED HIM FOR GOD'S SAKE TO TAKE THE MILL BACK AGAIN AND THAT IN AN INSTANT
LOOK AT ME WELL PRINCESS BEFORE YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD SAID HE I DON'T WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME IN A HURRY OH CRIED SHE THE LIONS ARE COMING I HAVE LOOKED AT YOU ENOUGH I AM SO FRIGHTENED
DO YOU REALLY MEAN WHAT YOU SAY PRINCE SAID THE FAIRY QUITE DECEIVED SURELY REPLIED THE PRINCE HOW COULD I DECEIVE YOU YOU SEE IT IS SO MUCH MORE FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BE LOVED BY A FAIRY THAN BY A SIMPLE PRINCESS
FOR I KNOW THAT THOSE WHO ARE MERCIFUL TO ANIMALS WILL BE STILL KINDER TO THEIR FELLOW MEN IF YOU HAD REFUSED TO HELP ME
WHEN YOU HAVE GOT THERE
UTTERED SUCH PIERCING CRIES AND LAMENTATIONS THAT THE KING HEARING THEM ENTIRELY LOST HIS COURAGE AND PRESENCE OF MIND GIVING UP THE COMBAT HE FLEW TOWARD THE PRINCESS
FOR ALL DAY LONG SHE HAD TO GO ABOUT ALONE AND SHE DID SO WISH TO GO HOME TO HER FATHER AND MOTHER AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS THEN THE WHITE BEAR ASKED WHAT IT WAS THAT SHE WANTED AND SHE TOLD HIM
AND WHERE TO FIND THE CASTLE WHICH LAY EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON BUT IT WAS ONLY THE SAME THING ONCE AGAIN
WHICH I WANT TO HAVE WASHED OFF AND I HAVE VOWED TO MARRY NO ONE BUT THE WOMAN WHO IS ABLE TO DO IT IF SHE CANNOT DO THAT SHE IS NOT WORTH HAVING
BUT AFTER A TIME HE GREW IMPATIENT AND THOUGHT IT MUST BE JUST MERE LOVE OF FAULT FINDING THAT MADE HIS OLD TUTOR BLAME HIM WHEN EVERYONE ELSE WAS PRAISING AND FLATTERING HIM SO HE ORDERED HIM TO RETIRE FROM HIS COURT THOUGH HE STILL FROM TIME TO TIME SPOKE OF HIM AS A WORTHY MAN WHOM HE RESPECTED
WHEN SHE WISHED TO GET ON HER HORSE FALADA AGAIN THE WAITING MAID CALLED OUT I MEAN TO RIDE FALADA
AND THE PRINCE IN DESPAIR DETERMINED TO SEARCH THROUGH THE WORLD TILL HE FOUND HER HE FLEW ON AND ON FOR SEVERAL DAYS TILL HE CAME TO A GREAT DESERT WHERE HE SAW A CAVERN AND TO HIS DELIGHT THERE SAT CELIA SHARING THE SIMPLE BREAKFAST OF AN OLD HERMIT OVERJOYED TO HAVE FOUND HER
AND TOOK AWAY WITH THEM ALL THE GOLD AND SILVER THAT THEY COULD CARRY AND MOVED FAR AWAY FROM THE CASTLE WHICH LAY EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST
SO SHE DID THIS AND JOURNEYED TO THE SOUTH WIND NEITHER WAS SHE VERY LONG ON THE WAY WHEN THEY HAD GOT THERE THE WEST WIND ASKED HIM IF HE COULD TELL HER THE WAY TO THE CASTLE
AND WITH LONG SNAKES COILED ROUND HER NECK HAD GIVEN HER SUCH A BLOW WITH THE LANCE SHE CARRIED THAT BELLISSIMA FELL INTO THE QUEEN'S ARMS BLEEDING AND SENSELESS HER FOND MOTHER FEELING AS MUCH HURT BY THE BLOW AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF
ON CHRISTMAS EVE HE WAS SO POOR THAT HE CAME TO ME AND BEGGED FOR A TRIFLE FOR GOD'S SAKE AND NOW HE GIVES A FEAST AS IF HE WERE BOTH A COUNT AND A KING THOUGHT HE BUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT YOUR RICHES FROM SAID HE TO HIS BROTHER
A MAN CAME AND LAY DOWN BESIDE HER AND BEHOLD IT WAS THE WHITE BEAR WHO CAST OFF THE FORM OF A BEAST DURING THE NIGHT SHE NEVER SAW HIM HOWEVER
AND SAW IT COVERED WITH FLOWERS AND FRUIT SHE STOPPED AND BEGAN TO GATHER SOME OF THE ORANGES AND THEN PUTTING DOWN HER BASKET SHE SAT DOWN TO EAT THEM BUT WHEN IT WAS TIME TO GO ON AGAIN THE BASKET HAD DISAPPEARED AND THOUGH SHE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
THEN LET THE SLAUGHTERER CUT OFF THE HEAD OF THE HORSE I RODE HERE UPON
I SHALL INDEED BE GRATEFUL TO YOU WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO HIM TO BE RICH OR HANDSOME OR TO POSSESS ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD IF HE WERE WICKED YOU KNOW WELL HE WOULD STILL BE UNHAPPY ONLY A GOOD MAN CAN BE REALLY CONTENTED YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT ANSWERED THE FAIRY
THAT SHE BURST
AND GANG AND LOOK OUT O HER BACK DOOR AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD SEE SHE SAW NOCHT THE FIRST DAY THE SECOND DAY SHE DID THE SAME AND SAW NOCHT ON THE THIRD DAY SHE LOOKED AGAIN AND SAW A COACH AND SIX
HER MOTHER WANTED TO TALK WITH HER ALONE IN HER OWN CHAMBER BUT SHE REMEMBERED WHAT THE WHITE BEAR HAD SAID AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT GO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY CAN BE SAID AT ANY TIME
BUT NO THAT COULD NOT BE
IF YOU'RE THIRSTY SAID THE MAID DISMOUNT YOURSELF AND LIE DOWN BY THE WATER AND DRINK I DON'T MEAN TO BE YOUR SERVANT ANY LONGER THE PRINCESS WAS SO THIRSTY THAT SHE GOT DOWN
I PROMISED YOUR FATHER THAT I WOULD BE YOUR FRIEND AND TO KEEP MY WORD I HAVE COME TO BRING YOU A PRESENT AT THE SAME TIME SHE PUT A LITTLE GOLD RING UPON HIS FINGER TAKE GREAT CARE OF THIS RING SHE SAID IT IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN DIAMONDS EVERY TIME YOU DO A BAD DEED IT WILL PRICK YOUR FINGER
WHO HAD FAITHFULLY PROMISED TO MAKE THEM ALL RICH IF HE MIGHT BUT HAVE THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SHE SAID NO AND WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT SO THE MAN WENT OUT AGAIN AND SETTLED WITH THE WHITE BEAR
FOR HE KNEW HIS DOOR HAD BEEN TIGHTLY SHUT AND HE COULD NOT THINK HOW SHE HAD GOT IN BUT SHE SAID TO HIM I AM THE FAIRY TRUTH I WAS PASSING THROUGH THE WOOD WHEN YOU WERE OUT HUNTING
AND THE THREE DROPS OF BLOOD REPLIED IF YOUR MOTHER ONLY KNEW HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO AND AS SHE DRANK THUS AND LEANED RIGHT OVER THE WATER THE RAG CONTAINING THE THREE DROPS OF BLOOD FELL FROM HER BOSOM AND FLOATED DOWN THE STREAM
AND THEN SHE WILL HAVE ME ALWAYS WITH HER HANDSOME AGREEABLE AND GAY AS YOU SEE ME NOW FOR IF HER SHADOW STAYS BY HER MORE CLOSELY THAN I DO I SHALL BE SURPRISED
BLESS ME SAID THE OLD WOMAN AS ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER APPEARED AND SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE HER HUSBAND HAD GOT THE MILL FROM BUT HE WOULD NOT TELL HER THAT NEVER MIND WHERE I GOT IT
MY OLD WOMAN AND I OUGHT TO HAVE IT FOR OUR CHRISTMAS DINNER BUT SINCE YOU HAVE SET YOUR HEARTS UPON IT
BEHIND THEM CAME A TALL OLD WOMAN WHOSE UGLINESS WAS EVEN MORE SURPRISING THAN HER EXTREME OLD AGE SHE WORE A RUFF OF BLACK TAFFETA A RED VELVET HOOD AND A FARTHINGALE ALL IN RAGS
FOR I SWORE NOT TO BY HEAVEN OTHERWISE I SHOULD HAVE LOST MY LIFE THE OLD KING BEGGED HER TO TELL HIM ALL
AND IT HELD FAR THE RICHEST JEWELRY OF THE THREE SHE BARGAINED AS BEFORE AND THE AULD WIFE AS BEFORE TOOK IN THE SLEEPING DRINK TO THE YOUNG KNIGHT'S CHAMBER BUT HE TELLED HER HE COULDNA DRINK IT THAT NIGHT WITHOUT SWEETENING
BIDDING HER NO TO BREAK IT TILL SHE WAS IN THE GREATEST STRAIT EVER MORTAL COULD BE IN AND THAT WAD GET HER OUT O'T AGAIN SHE WAS LIFTED AND SET ON HIS BACK AND AWA THEY WENT
TO SEEK OUT EVERYTHING RARE AND PRECIOUS TO ADORN THE PRINCESS ALTHOUGH HER BEAUTY WAS SO PERFECT THAT NOTHING SHE WORE COULD MAKE HER LOOK PRETTIER AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES THOUGHT AND HE WAS NEVER HAPPY UNLESS HE WAS WITH HER
I SHALL PRETEND TO HATE HER UNTIL I AM SET FREE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT QUITE TAKEN IN BY THESE WORDS RESOLVED AT ONCE TO TRANSPORT THE PRINCE TO A PLEASANTER PLACE
SO SHE SEATED HERSELF ON HIS BACK AND THEY DID GO SO SWIFTLY
THERE WAS GREAT REJOICING OVER THE ARRIVAL AND THE PRINCE SPRANG FORWARD TO MEET THEM AND TAKING THE WAITING MAID FOR HIS BRIDE HE LIFTED HER DOWN FROM HER HORSE AND LED HER UPSTAIRS TO THE ROYAL CHAMBER IN THE MEANTIME THE REAL PRINCESS WAS LEFT STANDING BELOW IN THE COURTYARD
HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO BUT THE PRINCESS WAS MEEK AND SAID NOTHING ABOUT HER MAID'S RUDE BEHAVIOR AND QUIETLY MOUNTED HER HORSE AGAIN THEY RODE ON THEIR WAY FOR SEVERAL MILES BUT THE DAY WAS HOT
BUT THE TRUTH WAS SHE WAS AFRAID LEST THE HORSE SHOULD SPEAK AND TELL HOW SHE HAD TREATED THE PRINCESS SHE CARRIED HER POINT AND THE FAITHFUL FALADA WAS DOOMED TO DIE WHEN THE NEWS CAME TO THE EARS OF THE REAL PRINCESS SHE WENT TO THE SLAUGHTERER
AND RAINING SO HEAVILY AND BLOWING SO HARD THAT THE WALLS OF THE COTTAGE SHOOK AGAIN THEY WERE ALL SITTING TOGETHER BY THE FIRESIDE EACH OF THEM BUSY WITH SOMETHING OR OTHER
AND THE PEOPLE WERE FORCED TO GIVE HIM THE HAND MILL WHEN THE MAN CAME OUT AGAIN INTO THE YARD HE ASKED THE OLD WOOD CUTTER HOW HE WAS TO STOP THE HAND MILL AND WHEN HE HAD LEARNED THAT HE THANKED HIM AND SET OFF HOME WITH ALL THE SPEED HE COULD
AND PERHAPS EVEN EMBARRASSED THE YELLOW DWARF HIMSELF BUT EVEN HIS COURAGE GAVE WAY WHEN HE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIS BELOVED PRINCESS FOR THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT LOOKING MORE TERRIBLE THAN BEFORE MOUNTED UPON A WINGED GRIFFIN
IT HAD PILLOWS OF SILK AND CURTAINS OF SILK FRINGED WITH GOLD AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THE ROOM WAS OF GOLD OR SILVER BUT WHEN SHE HAD LAIN DOWN AND PUT OUT THE LIGHT
TILL MY LOCKS OF RUDDY GOLD NOW ASTRAY AND HANGING DOWN BE COMBED AND PLAITED IN A CROWN THEN A GUST OF WIND CAME AND BLEW CURDKEN'S HAT AWAY SO THAT HE HAD TO FLY OVER HILL AND DALE AFTER IT AND THE GIRL IN THE MEANTIME QUIETLY COMBED AND PLAITED HER HAIR
AND TO ADMIT THAT HIS PUNISHMENT WAS NOT MORE THAN HE HAD DESERVED HE LEFT OFF TEARING AT THE IRON BARS OF THE CAGE IN WHICH HE WAS SHUT UP AND BECAME AS GENTLE AS A LAMB THE HUNTERS WHO HAD CAUGHT HIM TOOK HIM TO A GREAT MENAGERIE
BENEATH THE LEFT EAR AND BID IT GO HOME AGAIN BUT YOU MAY TAKE THE GOLDEN APPLE WITH YOU SO THE GIRL SEATED HERSELF ON THE HORSE AND RODE FOR A LONG LONG WAY
AS SOON AS THE SWANS WHICH DREW THE FAIRY'S CHARIOT HAD ALIGHTED UNDER A PORCH WHICH WAS PAVED WITH DIAMONDS AND HAD ARCHES OF RUBIES THEY WERE GREETED ON ALL SIDES BY THOUSANDS OF BEAUTIFUL BEINGS
AND BRANDISHING HER CRUTCH THREATENINGLY SHE CRIED
AND THEY JOURNEYED THITHER SHE SITTING ON HIS BACK AND THEY WENT A LONG LONG WAY AND IT TOOK A LONG LONG TIME BUT AT LAST THEY CAME TO A LARGE WHITE FARMHOUSE
AT LAST HE SAID WELL IF YOU WON'T TELL ME CONFIDE YOUR TROUBLE TO THE IRON STOVE THERE AND HE WENT AWAY THEN SHE CREPT TO THE STOVE AND BEGAN TO SOB AND CRY AND TO POUR OUT HER POOR LITTLE HEART AND SAID HERE I SIT DESERTED BY ALL THE WORLD
THAT I FEAR THAT SHE WILL DIE AND I AM AFRAID THAT PERHAPS I AM THE CAUSE OF IT FOR SHE VERY MUCH WISHES ME TO BE MARRIED
SUGAR CANDY AND CROCODILE'S EGGS THIS CAKE SHE PREPARED WITH HER OWN HANDS AND PUTTING IT IN A LITTLE BASKET SHE SET OUT TO SEEK THE FAIRY BUT AS SHE WAS NOT USED TO WALKING FAR
EVERYTHING BECAME DARK AND HE FELT HIMSELF CARRIED ALONG THROUGH THE AIR BY A STRONG HAND THIS NEW MISFORTUNE WAS THE WORK OF THE WICKED FAIRY OF THE DESERT WHO HAD COME WITH THE YELLOW DWARF TO HELP HIM CARRY OFF THE PRINCESS
AT SEVEN YEARS END SHE GOT HER IRON SHOON CLAMB THE GLASSY HILL AND CHANCED TO COME TO THE AULD WASHERWIFE'S HABITATION THERE SHE WAS TELLED
YE MAUN SEAT YOURSEL ON THAT STANE
AND WERE BRIGHT RED AT THIS DREADFUL SIGHT THE POOR QUEEN WHO WAS TREMBLING LIKE A DOVE WHEN IT SEES A HAWK CRIED OUT AS LOUD AS SHE COULD
FOR ALL ROUND THE GREAT BANQUETING HALL HAD BEEN ARRANGED A THOUSAND BARRELS FULL OF GOLD AND NUMBERLESS BAGS MADE OF VELVET EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS AND FILLED WITH MONEY EACH ONE CONTAINING AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND GOLD PIECES
FOR IF WE ARE EVER TO GET THERE WE MUST HAVE THE DAY BEFORE US THE NORTH WIND WOKE HER BETIMES NEXT MORNING AND PUFFED HIMSELF UP AND MADE HIMSELF SO
AND YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT TOO FOR THEY HAVE EATEN MANY OTHER PEOPLE
WAS ABOUT BELLISSIMA FOR THAT WAS THE PRINCESS'S NAME AND ALL THE BONFIRES THAT THEY HAD WERE MADE OF THESE VERSES WHICH CRACKLED AND SPARKLED BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SORT OF WOOD BELLISSIMA WAS ALREADY FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
AND HE RESOLVED TO KEEP WAKING THAT NIGHT TO TRY WHAT HE COULD HEAR THAT BEING THE THIRD NIGHT AND THE DAMOSEL BEING BETWEEN HOPE AND DESPAIR SHE BRAK HER PLUM
AND MAKE A GREATER TRIUMPH HIS THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THEM SING OF HER TRIUMPHS SHE LED THE KING INTO THE MOST SPLENDID ROOM THAT CAN BE IMAGINED AND LEFT HIM ALONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE
BUT THAT HER DAUGHTER SEEMED SO UNWILLING TO MARRY AND SHE RECOMMENDED THEM TO GO AND TALK TO THE PRINCESS ABOUT IT THEMSELVES SO THIS THEY AT ONCE DID NOW BELLISSIMA WAS MUCH LESS PROUD SINCE HER ADVENTURE WITH THE YELLOW DWARF
DEAR CHILD TAKE GREAT CARE OF THIS RAG IT MAY BE OF USE TO YOU ON THE JOURNEY SO THEY TOOK A SAD FAREWELL OF EACH OTHER AND THE PRINCESS STUCK THE RAG IN FRONT OF HER DRESS MOUNTED HER HORSE
EVERYTHING HAPPENED JUST AS THE OLD MAN HAD SAID IT WOULD ALL THE PEOPLE GREAT AND SMALL CAME ROUND HIM LIKE ANTS ON AN ANT HILL AND EACH TRIED TO OUTBID THE OTHER FOR THE HAM BY RIGHTS
BUT THE YELLOW DWARF WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM LEAPING WITH HIS SPANISH CAT UPON THE BALCONY HE SNATCHED BELLISSIMA FROM THE QUEEN'S ARMS AND BEFORE ANY OF THE LADIES OF THE COURT COULD STOP HIM HE HAD SPRUNG UPON THE ROOF OF THE PALACE AND DISAPPEARED WITH HIS PRIZE
BUT AT LAST SHE DID ARRIVE AND THEN SHE ASKED THE EAST WIND IF HE COULD TELL HER THE WAY TO THE PRINCE WHO DWELT EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON WELL SAID THE EAST WIND
WHY IF YOU CANNOT MAKE A GIRL LIKE THAT DO AS YOU WISH
THE WHITE BEAR CAME TO FETCH HER SHE SEATED HERSELF ON HIS BACK WITH HER BUNDLE AND THUS THEY DEPARTED WHEN THEY HAD GONE A GREAT PART OF THE WAY THE WHITE BEAR SAID ARE YOU AFRAID
THEN A PUFF OF WIND CAME AND BLEW CURDKEN'S HAT FAR AWAY SO THAT HE HAD TO RUN AFTER IT AND WHEN HE RETURNED SHE HAD LONG FINISHED PUTTING UP HER GOLDEN LOCKS AND HE COULDN'T GET ANY HAIR SO THEY WATCHED THE GEESE TILL IT WAS DARK
AND ON COMING BACK SAID TO THE AULD WIFE SHE SAW NOCHT BUT A MUCKLE BLACK BULL COMING ROARING ALANG THE ROAD
SO THAT EVENING WHEN THE PRINCESS CAME ONCE MORE WITH HER SLEEPING DRINK
AND THE QUEEN MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE A HUNDRED TIMES SHE ASKED BELLISSIMA IF ANYTHING WAS THE MATTER WITH HER
BUT THAT YOU MUST BY NO MEANS DO OR YOU WILL BRING GREAT MISERY ON BOTH OF US SO ONE SUNDAY THE WHITE BEAR CAME AND SAID THAT THEY COULD NOW SET OUT TO SEE HER FATHER AND MOTHER
AND I MUST LEAVE YOU AND GO TO HER
BUT HE WAS VERY PATIENT ABOUT IT ONE DAY WHEN THEY GAVE HIM HIS LITTLE LOAF FOR BREAKFAST HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO EAT IT OUT IN THE GARDEN
FIVE OR SIX TIMES A DAY JUST TO PLEASE HER
AND IT WAS SO DARK THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY SEE AT ALL THE THUNDER CRASHED AND THE LIGHTNING SEEMED AS IF IT MUST BURN UP EVERYTHING THE TWO BASILISKS APPEARED
WITHOUT THE YELLOW DWARF AND HIS ORANGE TREE
OR NOT SO WITH GREAT CARE SHE MADE SOME OF THE PROPER CAKE TO PACIFY THE LIONS
HE POURED OUT THE DRINK AND SAE MADE THE AULD WIFE THINK HE HAD DRUNK IT THEY A WENT TO BED AGAIN
THROWING THE HAM TO HIM WELL I WILL DO WHAT I HAVE PROMISED SAID THE OTHER AND HE TOOK THE HAM AND SET OFF HE WENT ON AND ON FOR THE LIVELONG DAY AND AT NIGHTFALL HE CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT
AND RISING INTO THE AIR HE FLEW ROUND AND ROUND THE HOUSE UNTIL HE SAW AN OPEN WINDOW BUT HE SEARCHED THROUGH EVERY ROOM IN VAIN
AND YOU ALONE CAN SAVE ME I WILL SAY THAT I WANT TO SEE WHAT MY BRIDE CAN DO AND BID HER WASH THE SHIRT
TILL AT LAST SHE CAME TO A SMITH'S HOUSE AND THE SMITH PROMISED IF SHE WAD SERVE HIM SEVEN YEARS HE WAD MAKE HER IRON SHOON WHEREWI SHE COULD CLIMB OWRE THE GLASSY HILL
WHEN YOU GET INSIDE THEY WILL ALL WANT TO BUY YOUR HAM FOR THEY DON'T GET MUCH MEAT TO EAT THERE BUT YOU MUST NOT SELL IT UNLESS YOU CAN GET THE HAND MILL WHICH STANDS BEHIND THE DOOR FOR IT WHEN YOU COME OUT AGAIN
NO MY PRINCE REPLIED CELIA I CANNOT HELP THINKING YOU VERY HANDSOME BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD RICHES BE TO ME AND ALL THE GRAND DRESSES AND SPLENDID CARRIAGES THAT YOU WOULD GIVE ME
THE UNHAPPY QUEEN SEEING ALL AT ONCE WHAT A MISERABLE LIFE HER DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE WITH THIS DWARF COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA AND FELL DOWN INSENSIBLE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD WHEN SHE REVIVED
AND ALL THE LITTLE TROLLS MUST HAVE BURST TOO FOR THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN HEARD OF SINCE THE PRINCE AND HIS BRIDE SET FREE ALL THE CHRISTIAN FOLK WHO WERE IMPRISONED THERE
EVERY ONE OF THEM BUT UPON EACH IT HAD A DIFFERENT EFFECT ONE FELL ILL ONE WENT QUITE CRAZY
ON THE THIRD DAY SHE LOOKED OUT O THE BACK DOOR AND SAW A COACH AND FOUR COMING ALONG THE ROAD AWEEL QUO THE AULD WIFE YON'S FOR YOU SAE THEY TOOK HER IN AND AFF THEY SET
OF A GALLANT YOUNG KNIGHT THAT HAD GIVEN IN SOME BLUIDY SARKS TO WASH AND WHAEVER WASHED THAE SARKS WAS TO BE HIS WIFE THE AULD WIFE HAD WASHED TILL SHE WAS TIRED AND THEN SHE SET TO HER DOCHTER
THE QUEEN YOUR MOTHER HAS PROMISED YOU IN MARRIAGE HAS PROMISED ME INTERRUPTED THE PRINCESS OH NO I'M SURE SHE HAS NOT
DO WISH YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PROUD WHAT MAKES YOU DESPISE ALL THESE NICE KINGS I WISH YOU TO MARRY ONE OF THEM AND YOU DO NOT TRY TO PLEASE ME I AM SO HAPPY BELLISSIMA ANSWERED
THE BLACK BLACK BULL OF NORROWAY SUDDEN THE TAPERS CEASE TO BURN THE MINSTRELS CEASE TO PLAY THE COUT OF KEELDAR BY J LEYDEN
I CANNOT SAY BUT I AM PRETTY SURE THAT THEY DID NOT LEARN MUCH FROM HER BUT IN THE AFTERNOON AFTER THEY HAD DINED AT MIDDAY ALL HAPPENED
BUT SOON THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND WISHED THAT HE WERE FREE I WOULD RETURN GOOD FOR EVIL HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND SAVE THE UNHAPPY MAN'S LIFE HE HAD HARDLY WISHED THIS WHEN HIS IRON CAGE FLEW OPEN AND HE RUSHED TO THE SIDE OF THE KEEPER WHO WAS AWAKE AND WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF AGAINST THE TIGER
IN SAYING THIS HE WAS TOUCHING A WEAK POINT IN HIS BROTHER'S CHARACTER FOR THE PRINCE'S FEAR OF LOSING ANY OF HIS POWER MADE HIM AT ONCE ABANDON HIS FIRST IDEA OF TRYING TO BE GOOD AND RESOLVE TO TRY AND FRIGHTEN THE SHEPHERDESS INTO CONSENTING TO MARRY HIM
WHO CAME TO MEET THEM JOYFULLY SINGING THESE WORDS WHEN LOVE WITHIN A HEART WOULD REIGN USELESS TO STRIVE AGAINST HIM TIS THE PROUD BUT FEEL A SHARPER PAIN
NOW WHEN THE TIME DREW NEAR FOR HER TO BE MARRIED AND TO DEPART INTO A FOREIGN KINGDOM HER OLD MOTHER GAVE HER MUCH COSTLY BAGGAGE AND MANY ORNAMENTS GOLD AND SILVER
THERE WAS GREAT JOY AND GLADNESS BETWEEN THEM ALL THAT NIGHT BUT THE NEXT DAY WHEN THE WEDDING WAS TO TAKE PLACE THE PRINCE SAID I MUST SEE WHAT MY BRIDE CAN DO
WHO WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE HE WAS A DWARF AND HAD SUCH A YELLOW FACE AND LIVED IN THE ORANGE TREE I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT FOR I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A WIFE ALL OVER THE WORLD NOW IF YOU WILL PROMISE THAT SHE SHALL MARRY ME
AND CURDKEN WENT ON TO TELL WHAT PASSED ON THE COMMON WHERE THE GEESE FED AND HOW HE HAD ALWAYS TO CHASE HIS HAT THE OLD KING BADE HIM GO AND DRIVE FORTH HIS FLOCK AS USUAL NEXT DAY AND WHEN MORNING CAME
IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE BROTHER HAD BEEN FORCED TO GIVE SOMETHING TO HIM AND HE WAS NOT BETTER PLEASED AT BEING ASKED NOW THAN HE GENERALLY WAS IF YOU WILL DO WHAT I ASK YOU
JUST THAT HE MIGHT NOT FEEL THAT HE WAS A PRISONER BUT HE FELT SURE THAT SHE HAD NOT REALLY GONE QUITE AWAY BUT WAS WATCHING HIM FROM SOME HIDING PLACE SO WALKING UP TO A GREAT MIRROR HE SAID TO IT
BUT THE YOUNG GIRL TO WHOM HE HAD GIVEN HIS BREAD GAVE A CRY OF TERROR AND TOOK HIM UP IN HER ARMS SAYING DON'T TOUCH IT MY POOR LITTLE DOG THAT HOUSE IS THE PALACE OF PLEASURE AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF IT IS POISONED AT THE SAME MOMENT A VOICE SAID YOU SEE A GOOD ACTION ALWAYS BRINGS ITS REWARD
WHICH SHONE WITH GOLD AND SILVER LIKEWISE A LARGE HALL IN WHICH THERE WAS A WELL SPREAD TABLE AND IT WAS SO MAGNIFICENT
THE GOOD KING WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THIS PROMISE AND VERY SOON AFTERWARD HE DIED PRINCE DARLING WAS VERY SORRY
AND A LITTLE FURTHER ON WAS A TINY THATCHED COTTAGE OUT OF WHICH CAME THE YELLOW DWARF WITH A VERY JAUNTY AIR
AND NOBODY COULD LIKE HIM ANY LONGER ONE DAY WHEN THE PRINCE WAS WALKING ABOUT
BENT OVER THE STREAM AND DRANK FOR SHE WASN'T ALLOWED TO DRINK OUT OF THE GOLDEN GOBLET AS SHE DRANK SHE MURMURED OH HEAVEN WHAT AM I TO DO AND THE THREE DROPS OF BLOOD REPLIED IF YOUR MOTHER ONLY KNEW
SO SHE CAME IN CAN YOU WASH THIS SHIRT CLEAN HE CRIED OH I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID BUT I WILL TRY
I HAVE NO DOUBT THIS IS THE PLACE THOUGHT THE MAN WITH THE HAM AN OLD MAN WITH A LONG WHITE BEARD WAS STANDING IN THE OUTHOUSE CHOPPING YULE LOGS GOOD EVENING SAID THE MAN WITH THE HAM GOOD EVENING TO YOU
WHO WAS AT THAT MOMENT RESTORED TO HIS NATURAL SHAPE YOU PROMISED TO LOVE ME ALWAYS TELL ME THAT YOU REALLY MEAN WHAT YOU SAID OR I SHALL HAVE TO ASK THE FAIRY TO GIVE ME BACK THE FORM OF THE DOVE WHICH PLEASED YOU SO MUCH YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THAT SHE WILL CHANGE HER MIND SAID THE FAIRY
HIS FOSTER BROTHER WHO WANTED HIM TO KEEP THIS RESOLUTION
THE PRINCESS ASKED HER WHAT SHE WANTED FOR IT AND SHE REPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT FOR SALE EITHER FOR GOLD OR MONEY BUT THAT IF SHE COULD GET LEAVE TO GO TO THE PRINCE AND BE WITH HIM DURING THE NIGHT SHE SHOULD HAVE IT
LIT HER CANDLE LET HER LIGHT SHINE ON HIM AND SAW HIM AND HE WAS THE HANDSOMEST PRINCE THAT EYES HAD EVER BEHELD
AND SHE IN HER ANXIETY NEVER EVEN NOTICED HER LOSS BUT THE WAITING MAID HAD OBSERVED IT WITH DELIGHT AS SHE KNEW IT GAVE HER POWER OVER THE BRIDE FOR IN LOSING THE DROPS OF BLOOD THE PRINCESS HAD BECOME WEAK AND POWERLESS
YOU WERE OUT OF TEMPER BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT HAVE WHAT YOU WANTED AND YOU THOUGHT ALL MEN AND ANIMALS WERE ONLY MADE TO DO YOUR PLEASURE
AH PRINCE SHE SAID CAN I BELIEVE THAT YOU REALLY LOVE ME SO MUCH TIME WILL SHOW MADAM REPLIED THE KING BUT IF YOU WISH TO CONVINCE ME THAT YOU HAVE SOME REGARD FOR ME DO NOT I BEG OF YOU
THE EAST WIND WENT IN AND SAID THAT THE GIRL WHOM HE HAD BROUGHT WAS THE ONE WHO OUGHT TO HAVE HAD THE PRINCE UP AT THE CASTLE WHICH LAY EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON AND THAT NOW SHE WAS TRAVELING ABOUT TO FIND HIM AGAIN
AND DIPPED IT IN THE WATER THAN IT WAS WHITE AS DRIVEN SNOW
IF YOU HAD NOT NOTICED HOW MUCH I PITIED THESE PRINCES WHO WERE LEAVING ME FOR EVER BUT FOR YOU SIRE IT IS VERY DIFFERENT YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE PLEASED WITH ME
BEGAN AS BEFORE SINGING SEVEN LANG YEARS I SERVED FOR THEE THE GLASSY HILL I CLAMB FOR THEE THE BLUIDY SHIRT I WRANG FOR THEE AND WILT THOU NO WAUKEN AND TURN TO ME HE HEARD
AND SHE HAD TO TELL HIM HOW SHE HAD COME THERE YOU HAVE COME JUST IN TIME SAID THE PRINCE FOR I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MARRIED TO MORROW BUT I WILL NOT HAVE THE LONG NOSED PRINCESS
WHO CAME FORWARD AND THREW OUT A PLATE OF MOST DELICIOUS LOOKING FOOD THEN THE WINDOW WAS SHUT AGAIN AND PRINCE DARLING WHO HAD NOT HAD ANYTHING TO EAT ALL DAY THOUGHT HE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING SOMETHING
BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
TIS YOU PASS UNDER PRINCESS FAIR IF YOUR MOTHER ONLY KNEW HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO THEN SHE WENT ON HER WAY TILL SHE CAME TO THE COMMON WHERE SHE SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO COMB OUT HER HAIR
THAT FAITHLESS PRINCESS WHO WOULD HAVE MARRIED YOU IS PROMISED TO ME SEE IF SHE HAS NOT UPON HER FINGER A RING MADE OF ONE OF MY HAIRS JUST TRY TO TAKE IT OFF
BY BEING GENTLE AND OBEDIENT TO THE MAN WHO HAD TO TAKE CARE OF HIM UNFORTUNATELY THIS MAN WAS VERY ROUGH AND UNKIND AND THOUGH THE POOR MONSTER WAS QUITE QUIET HE OFTEN BEAT HIM WITHOUT RHYME OR REASON WHEN HE HAPPENED TO BE IN A BAD TEMPER
WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW ALL THESE THINGS AND REMEMBERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE TOO FELL INTO THE DEEPEST SADNESS
I ACCEPT THE GIFT THAT YOU MAKE ME OF YOURSELF AND I WILL LOVE YOU ALWAYS
SAID THE PRINCESS FOR SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND WHAT SHE WOULD DO
AT LAST THE CHIEF MEN OF THE KINGDOM ANXIOUS TO SEE THEIR PRINCESS MARRIED SENT TO THE QUEEN TO BEG HER TO CHOOSE A HUSBAND FOR HER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SHE REPLIED THAT NOTHING WOULD PLEASE HER BETTER
CASTLE WHICH IS EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON YOU WILL BE A LONG TIME IN GETTING TO IT IF EVER YOU GET TO IT AT ALL
DO LEAVE ME IN PEACE MADAM I DON'T WANT TO CARE FOR ANYONE BUT YOU WOULD BE VERY HAPPY WITH ANY OF THESE PRINCES SAID THE QUEEN
NOT ONE OF THE LIONS TIGERS OR BEARS SHALL TOUCH YOU THE QUEEN LOOKED AT HIM AND WAS ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF HIS UGLY LITTLE FACE AS SHE HAD BEEN OF THE LIONS BEFORE SO THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD
AND AS HE HAD NO HAIR AND VERY LONG EARS HE LOOKED ALTOGETHER A SHOCKING LITTLE OBJECT I AM DELIGHTED
GIVE ME YOUR ARM AND LET US GO BACK TO THE DINING ROOM THEY WON'T KNOW WHAT WE MEAN BY OUR ABSENCE GO IN IF YOU LIKE BUT ALLOW ME TO STAY HERE WHY BECAUSE YOUR MIRTH HURTS ME
AND COULD NOT FORGIVE HER HE SAID TO HER SOMEWHAT CRUELLY THAT HE WAS TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE FOLLIES OF A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HIM TREATED WITH RESPECT UNDER HIS OWN ROOF AND HE WENT AWAY IN GREAT INDIGNATION
HAD ALMOST COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED AT THE END OF SIX WEEKS THE COUNT WAS ENTIRELY GIVEN UP AND ONLY THE DUKE OBLIGED ME TO CONCEAL MY LIAISON WITH MARGUERITE AND EVEN HE WAS SENT AWAY WHEN I WAS THERE
AND OF HER UNITY AT THE CONTACT OF MEN AND THINGS AS FOR ME I EXPERIENCED THAT MORE THAN MOST MINE WAS NOT AN ORDINARY LOVE I WAS AS MUCH IN LOVE AS AN ORDINARY CREATURE COULD BE
ADD TO THIS THAT FROM THE PLACE WHERE I WAS I COULD SEE ON THE SHORE A CHARMING LITTLE HOUSE OF TWO STORIES WITH A SEMICIRCULAR RAILING THROUGH THE RAILING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE A GREEN LAWN SMOOTH AS VELVET
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I RECEIVED THIS NOTE
WE LEFT THE HOUSE AND STARTED ON OUR RETURN TO PARIS TALKING OVER THE NEW PLAN
AND AT THIRTY THEY COULD AFFORD THE LUXURY OF HAVING A LOVER FOR NOTHING IF I HAD ONLY KNOWN ONCE WHAT I KNOW NOW IN SHORT SAY NOTHING TO MARGUERITE AND BRING HER BACK TO PARIS YOU HAVE LIVED WITH HER ALONE FOR FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS
SINCE YOU REALLY WISH IT I WILL LISTEN THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD ME AND I HAVE SCARCELY CHANGED A WORD OF THE TOUCHING STORY YES ARMAND WENT ON LETTING HIS HEAD SINK BACK ON THE CHAIR
THE DOCTOR HAD ALLOWED HIM TO GET UP AND WE OFTEN SAT TALKING AT THE OPEN WINDOW AT THE HOUR WHEN THE SUN IS AT ITS HEIGHT FROM TWELVE TO TWO I WAS CAREFUL NOT TO REFER TO MARGUERITE FEARING LEST THE NAME SHOULD AWAKEN SAD RECOLLECTIONS
I SHALL LIVE LONGER THAN YOU WILL LOVE ME AND SHE WENT SINGING INTO THE DINING ROOM WHERE IS NANINE SHE SAID SEEING GASTON AND PRUDENCE ALONE SHE IS ASLEEP IN YOUR ROOM
WHO IS YOUR FRIEND A CHARMING FELLOW VERY AMUSING HE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WELL ALL RIGHT WE WILL GO AFTER THIS PIECE IS OVER FOR I KNOW THE LAST PIECE WITH PLEASURE
AND I FELT HER SUPPLE BODY WEIGH LIGHTLY ON MY CLASPED HANDS IF YOU KNEW HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU I SAID IN A LOW VOICE REALLY TRUE I SWEAR IT WELL
WHICH IS VERY DISAGREEABLE DEBTS ARE CONTRACTED ACQUAINTANCES BEGUN ABOUT A GREEN TABLE END BY QUARRELS IN WHICH LIFE OR HONOUR COMES TO GRIEF AND THOUGH ONE MAY BE AN HONEST MAN ONE FINDS ONESELF RUINED BY VERY HONEST MEN
WHEN YOU ARE STRONG AGAIN YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE LIFE YOU ARE LEADING IF YOU CHOOSE BUT I AM SURE YOU WILL COME TO PREFER A QUIET LIFE WHICH WILL MAKE YOU HAPPIER AND KEEP YOUR BEAUTY UNSPOILED YOU THINK LIKE THAT TO NIGHT BECAUSE THE WINE HAS MADE YOU SAD
YES PROTECTION REPLIED PRUDENCE POOR OLD MAN HE WOULD BE GREATLY EMBARRASSED TO OFFER HER ANYTHING ELSE PRUDENCE THEN TOLD ME HOW MARGUERITE HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE DUKE AT BAGNERES
YOU REPROACH ME MARGUERITE IT ISN'T GENEROUS
IT WAS TRUE BUT HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL I MIGHT BE I OUGHT NOT TO MAKE USE OF MY BEAUTY TO SPOIL THE FUTURE OF A YOUNG MAN BY SUCH EXPENDITURE AS I WAS CAUSING AT THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO DO
NOT ONLY IF YOU WILL NOT LOVE ME BUT IF YOU WILL NOT LET ME LOVE YOU BUT FOOLISH CREATURE THAT YOU ARE
HIS LETTER WHICH I INCLOSE WITH THIS BEGGED ME IN THE MOST SERIOUS TERMS TO KEEP YOU AWAY ON THE FOLLOWING DAY ON SOME EXCUSE OR OTHER AND TO SEE YOUR FATHER WHO WISHED TO SPEAK TO ME AND ASKED ME PARTICULARLY NOT TO SAY ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT IT
AND TRIED TO OPEN IT IN VAIN FOR IT WAS LOCKED WHEN I OPENED THE DRAWER IN WHICH THE TRINKETS AND DIAMONDS WERE USUALLY KEPT THESE OPENED WITHOUT RESISTANCE BUT THE JEWEL CASES HAD DISAPPEARED
ONE EVENING SEATED ON THE BALCONY OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WE LOOKED AT THE MOON WHICH SEEMED TO RISE WITH DIFFICULTY OUT OF ITS BED OF CLOUDS AND WE LISTENED TO THE WIND VIOLENTLY RUSTLING THE TREES WE HELD EACH OTHER'S HANDS
TELL ME FRANKLY WHERE ARE MARGUERITE'S HORSES SOLD THE SHAWL SOLD THE DIAMONDS PAWNED AND WHO HAS SOLD AND PAWNED THEM
YES YOU WOULD STAY BY ME ALL DAY YES AND EVEN ALL NIGHT AS LONG AS I DID NOT WEARY YOU AND WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT DEVOTION
TIME WENT BY THE IMPRESSION IF NOT THE MEMORY FADED GRADUALLY FROM MY MIND I TRAVELLED LOVE AFFAIRS HABITS WORK TOOK THE PLACE OF OTHER THOUGHTS AND WHEN I RECALLED THIS ADVENTURE I LOOKED UPON IT AS ONE OF THOSE PASSIONS WHICH ONE HAS
AND PROFITED BY A MOMENT IN WHICH SHE LOOKED MY WAY TO WAVE MY HAND TO HER AS I EXPECTED SHE BECKONED TO ME TO COME TO HER BOX PRUDENCE DUVERNOY THAT WAS THE MILLINER'S AUSPICIOUS NAME
THE TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO JOIN MY FATHER AND SISTER HAD NOW ARRIVED AND I DID NOT GO BOTH OF THEM WROTE TO ME FREQUENTLY BEGGING ME TO COME TO THESE LETTERS I REPLIED AS BEST I COULD
ARMAND ORDER AN OPEN CARRIAGE AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER WE WERE AT WIDOW ARNOULD'S PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE INN WHICH IS A HOTEL ON WEEK DAYS AND A TEA GARDEN ON SUNDAYS
SINCE THAT DAY HE HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF IN VAIN MARGUERITE DISMISSED HER GUESTS CHANGED HER WAY OF LIFE THE DUKE WAS NOT TO BE HEARD OF I WAS THE GAINER IN SO
WHERE ASKED PRUDENCE YONDER AND MARGUERITE POINTED TO THE HOUSE IN QUESTION AH DELICIOUS REPLIED PRUDENCE DO YOU LIKE IT VERY MUCH
HE HAS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR IT WOULD BE A POSITION FOR HER WHILE YOU WILL CERTAINLY BE OBLIGED TO LEAVE HER
YES AND DID SHE PROMISE TO BELIEVE YOU NO SHE IS NOT LIKE PRUDENCE DID SHE PROMISE TO BETTER STILL MY DEAR FELLOW YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT
BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER MARGUERITE AND HER FRIEND LEFT THE BOX I ROSE FROM MY SEAT ARE YOU GOING SAID ERNEST YES WHY AT THAT MOMENT HE SAW THAT THE BOX WAS EMPTY
EXACT FROM THEIR MISTRESSES A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE PRESENT THE PAST AND EVEN THE FUTURE AS THEY GET ACCUSTOMED TO HER THEY WANT TO RULE HER AND THE MORE ONE GIVES THEM THE MORE EXACTING THEY BECOME
THE SOUL IS BUT THE VESTAL CHARGED TO FEED THE SACRED FIRE OF LOVE
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS SMILING ACROSS AT MARGUERITE TO ASK HER WHOM ARE YOU LOOKING AT MARGUERITE GAUTIER YOU KNOW HER YES I AM HER MILLINER AND SHE IS A NEIGHBOUR OF MINE
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT SHE READ MANON LESCAUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I FOUND HER SEVERAL TIMES MAKING NOTES IN THE BOOK AND SHE ALWAYS DECLARED THAT WHEN A WOMAN LOVES SHE CAN NOT DO AS MANON DID
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN YOU KNOW HOW IT CUTS SHORT THE DAYS AND WITH WHAT LOVING LISTLESSNESS ONE DRIFTS INTO THE MORROW YOU KNOW THAT FORGETFULNESS OF EVERYTHING WHICH COMES OF A VIOLENT CONFIDENT RECIPROCATED LOVE
WE BREATHED TOGETHER THAT TRUE LIFE WHICH NEITHER MARGUERITE NOR I HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE HER DELIGHT IN THE SMALLEST THINGS WAS LIKE THAT OF A CHILD THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE RAN IN THE GARDEN LIKE A CHILD OF TEN
BEYOND DISTINCT IN THE SUNLIGHT RISE LITTLE WHITE HOUSES WITH RED ROOFS AND MANUFACTORIES WHICH AT THAT DISTANCE PUT AN ADMIRABLE FINISH TO THE LANDSCAPE BEYOND THAT PARIS IN THE MIST
YOU REALLY LOVE ME AS MUCH AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOVE I THINK AND THAT HAS LASTED SINCE SINCE THE DAY I SAW YOU GO INTO SUSSE'S THREE YEARS AGO DO YOU KNOW THAT IS TREMENDOUSLY FINE
VERY MUCH IN NEED OF MONEY AND NOT POSSESSING THE FORTUNE NECESSARY FOR SUPPORTING THE LIFE THEY LEAD THEY GAMBLE THEN AND WITH THIS RESULT OR ELSE THEY GAIN AND THEN THOSE WHO LOSE SERVE TO PAY FOR THEIR HORSES AND MISTRESSES
AND WE SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING PERFECT THE DUKE IS GOING TO LOOK AFTER EVERY SINGLE THING AH MY DEAR SHE ADDED KISSING ME YOU'RE IN LUCK IT'S A MILLIONAIRE WHO MAKES YOUR BED FOR YOU
A WEEK LATER MARGUERITE WAS SETTLED IN HER COUNTRY HOUSE AND I WAS INSTALLED AT POINT DU JOUR THEN BEGAN AN EXISTENCE WHICH I SHALL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING TO YOU
I HAD NOTICED THAT EVER SINCE HIS LAST VISIT TO THE CEMETERY AND THE SIGHT WHICH HAD BROUGHT ON SO VIOLENT A CRISIS SORROW SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN OVERCOME BY SICKNESS AND MARGUERITE'S DEATH NO LONGER APPEARED TO HIM UNDER ITS FORMER ASPECT
IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO REPROACH ME SINCE IT WAS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE YOU YOU AND YOUR FRIEND LITTLE BY LITTLE I HAD DRAWN NEARER TO MARGUERITE I HAD PUT MY ARMS ABOUT HER WAIST
I MUST TELL YOU MY FRIEND THAT FOR TWO YEARS THE SIGHT OF THIS GIRL HAD MADE A STRANGE IMPRESSION ON ME WHENEVER I CAME ACROSS HER WITHOUT KNOWING WHY I TURNED PALE AND MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY I HAVE A FRIEND WHO STUDIES THE OCCULT SCIENCES AND HE WOULD CALL WHAT I EXPERIENCED THE AFFINITY OF FLUIDS
WHO THINKS HE IS MAKING SOME HEADWAY BY CALLING ON HER AT ELEVEN IN THE EVENING AND BY SENDING HER JEWELS TO ANY EXTENT BUT SHE CAN'T STAND HIM SHE MAKES A MISTAKE HE IS VERY RICH IT IS IN VAIN THAT I SAY TO HER FROM TIME TO TIME
AS FOR HER SHE CONTINUED TO LOVE ME AS MUCH OR EVEN MORE THAN EVER AS I TOLD YOU I BEGAN BY BEING ALLOWED TO STAY ONLY FROM MIDNIGHT TO SIX O'CLOCK THEN I WAS ASKED SOMETIMES TO A BOX IN THE THEATRE
FOR TWO MONTHS WE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TO PARIS NO ONE CAME TO SEE US EXCEPT PRUDENCE AND JULIE DUPRAT OF WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU
WHOM ARE YOU BOWING TO I ASKED MARGUERITE GAUTIER HE SAID SHE SEEMS MUCH CHANGED FOR I DID NOT RECOGNISE HER I SAID WITH AN EMOTION THAT YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND SHE HAS BEEN ILL THE POOR GIRL WON'T LAST LONG I REMEMBER THE WORDS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SPOKEN TO ME YESTERDAY
THAT I HAD TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS IN MY OWN HOUSE AND THAT I HAD NO NEED TO RENDER HIM AN ACCOUNT OF MY LIFE EXCEPT BECAUSE OF THE SINCERE AFFECTION WHICH I HAD FOR HIS SON
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST AN EXISTENCE
REPENTING OF YOUR LOVE AND ACCUSING ME OF MY PAST YOU SHOULD LET ME FALL BACK INTO THAT LIFE FROM WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN ME
AT THESE WORDS SHE LOOKED AT ME AS IF TO READ IN MY EYES WHETHER MY OATH WAS SINCERE THEN FLUNG HERSELF INTO MY ARMS AND HIDING HER HEAD IN MY BOSOM SAID TO ME
AND I WILL SAY GOOD BYE FOREVER TO THE LIFE FOR WHICH I NOW BLUSH YOU WON'T EVER REPROACH ME FOR THE PAST TELL ME TEARS CHOKED MY VOICE I COULD ONLY REPLY BY CLASPING MARGUERITE TO MY HEART WELL
EVERY DAY ONE DISCOVERS IN ONE'S MISTRESS A NEW CHARM AND UNKNOWN DELIGHTS EXISTENCE ITSELF IS BUT THE UNCEASING ACCOMPLISHMENT OF AN UNCHANGING DESIRE
I COULD NOT POSSIBLY TELL YOU WHAT THEY WERE ACTING ALL THAT I REMEMBER IS THAT FROM TIME TO TIME I RAISED MY EYES TO THE BOX I HAD QUITTED SO ABRUPTLY AND THAT THE FACES OF FRESH VISITORS SUCCEEDED ONE ANOTHER ALL THE TIME I WAS FAR FROM HAVING GIVEN UP THINKING ABOUT MARGUERITE
THE WINDOW OF HER DRESSING ROOM LOOKS ON TO THE WINDOW OF MINE THEY SAY SHE IS A CHARMING GIRL DON'T YOU KNOW HER NO BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SHALL I ASK HER TO COME OVER TO OUR BOX NO
AS NOT TO KNOW THAT I WAS LIVING THEM I BEGAN BY BORROWING FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS ON MY LITTLE CAPITAL AND WITH THIS I TOOK TO GAMBLING SINCE GAMBLING HOUSES WERE DESTROYED GAMBLING GOES ON EVERYWHERE
AND LIVE WITH YOU WITHOUT BEING A TOO HEAVY EXPENSE I TOLD HIM OF OUR HAPPINESS OF HOW YOU HAD SHOWN ME THE POSSIBILITY OF A QUIETER AND HAPPIER LIFE AND HE ENDED BY GIVING IN TO THE EVIDENCE OFFERING ME HIS HAND AND ASKING PARDON FOR THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD AT FIRST APPROACHED ME
I DID NOT RECOGNISE HER SHE WAS VEILED IT IS TRUE BUT VEILED THOUGH SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWO YEARS EARLIER I SHOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED TO SEE HER IN ORDER TO RECOGNISE HER I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN HER INTUITIVELY
SAID MARGUERITE WE WILL WALK THERE A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARD I SAW MARGUERITE FROM THE STREET AT A WINDOW OF ONE OF THE LARGE ROOMS OF THE RESTAURANT PULLING THE CAMELLIAS OF HER BOUQUET TO PIECES ONE BY ONE ONE OF THE TWO MEN WAS LEANING OVER HER SHOULDER AND WHISPERING IN HER EAR
I AM AFRAID OF THE WINTER I AM PARTICULARLY AFRAID OF YOUR RETURN TO PARIS WHY
I WILL DO WITHOUT IT BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO I DON'T IN THE LEAST KNOW PRUDENCE WAS NO DOUBT GOING TO MAKE SOME REPLY BUT I ENTERED SUDDENLY AND FLUNG MYSELF AT MARGUERITE'S FEET
WELL IT IS ALL SETTLED SHE SAID AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE IS TAKEN ASKED PRUDENCE YES HE AGREED AT ONCE I DID NOT KNOW THE DUKE BUT I FELT ASHAMED OF DECEIVING HIM
FOR WHEN SHE PUT DOWN HER GLASSES A SMILE THAT CHARMING FEMININE SALUTATION FLITTED ACROSS HER LIPS AS IF TO ANSWER THE BOW WHICH SHE SEEMED TO EXPECT BUT I DID NOT RESPOND
WHO HAD REMEMBERED MY FACE FOR A MOMENT DID NOT REMEMBER MY NAME I WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED TO MY DISADVANTAGE THAN THUS FORGOTTEN I KNEW SAID GASTON THAT SHE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEE US
THE PART OF THOSE WHOM THEY SEE EVERY DAY TO ANSWER THEM PROPERLY ONE REQUIRES A CERTAIN KNACK AND I HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF ACQUIRING IT
ASK HER IF YOU MAY REALLY THERE IS NO NEED TO BE PARTICULAR WITH HER COME WHAT HE SAID TROUBLED ME I FEARED TO DISCOVER THAT MARGUERITE WAS NOT WORTHY OF THE SENTIMENT WHICH I FELT FOR HER IN A BOOK OF ALPHONSE KARR ENTITLES
FROM THE MOMENT WE CAN NO LONGER SERVE THE VANITY OR THE PLEASURE OF OUR LOVERS THEY LEAVE US AND LONG NIGHTS FOLLOW LONG DAYS I KNOW IT I WAS IN BED FOR TWO MONTHS AND AFTER THREE WEEKS NO ONE CAME TO SEE ME
THE NIGHTS THAT I DID NOT SPEND IN THE RUE D'ANTIN IF I HAD SPENT THEM ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM I COULD NOT HAVE SLEPT JEALOUSY WOULD HAVE KEPT ME AWAKE AND INFLAMED MY BLOOD AND MY THOUGHTS
THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH SHUT YOUR EYES NOW THAT IS ALL THAT ANY ONE ASKS OF YOU AT THE END OF A FORTNIGHT SHE WILL TAKE THE COMTE DE N AND SHE WILL SAVE UP DURING THE WINTER
I MUST SEEM VERY SILLY TO YOU BUT I AM FRIGHTFULLY TROUBLED BY WHAT I HAVE JUST SEEN YOU ARE VERY GOOD WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE OF ME I CAN NOT SLEEP I MUST AMUSE MYSELF A LITTLE
ASSUMED ALL AT ONCE AN APPEARANCE OF NOISE AND DISORDER NEVER BELIEVE HOWEVER DISINTERESTED THE LOVE OF A KEPT WOMAN MAY BE THAT IT WILL COST ONE NOTHING
IS IN YOUR HANDS HAVE YOU THE RIGHT HAVE YOU THE STRENGTH TO SHATTER IT IN THE NAME OF YOUR LOVE AND OF YOUR REPENTANCE MARGUERITE GRANT ME THE HAPPINESS OF MY CHILD
AND YET I OFTEN FOUND HER SAD WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO GET ANY EXPLANATION OF THE REASON EXCEPT SOME PHYSICAL CAUSE FEARING THAT SO MONOTONOUS A LIFE WAS BEGINNING TO WEARY HER I PROPOSED RETURNING TO PARIS
AND FOR WHOM ELSE SHOULD I BURY MYSELF HERE IF NOT FOR YOU WELL THEN MARGUERITE LET ME TAKE IT MYSELF YOU ARE MAD NOT ONLY IS IT UNNECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS
I COULD SEE HER THROUGH THE SHOP WINDOWS SELECTING WHAT SHE HAD COME TO BUY I MIGHT HAVE GONE IN BUT I DARED NOT I DID NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS AND I WAS AFRAID LEST SHE SHOULD GUESS WHY I HAD COME IN AND BE OFFENDED NEVERTHELESS I DID NOT THINK I SHOULD EVER SEE HER AGAIN
WHICH YOU TOLD ME OF IN THE EVENING NEXT DAY WHEN YOU WERE AT PARIS WAITING FOR YOUR FATHER AND HE DID NOT RETURN
WELL SAID MARGUERITE WELL I HAVE SEEN THE DUKE WHAT DID HE SAY THAT HE WOULD GLADLY FORGIVE YOU IN REGARD TO THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE
COVERING HER HANDS WITH TEARS IN MY JOY AT BEING THUS LOVED MY LIFE IS YOURS MARGUERITE YOU NEED THIS MAN NO LONGER AM I NOT HERE SHALL I EVER LEAVE YOU AND CAN I EVER REPAY YOU FOR THE HAPPINESS THAT YOU GIVE ME
WELL TELL THE DUKE TO TAKE IT FOR YOU HE WOULD DO SO I AM SURE I'LL SEE ABOUT IT IF YOU LIKE MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME
AND WHICH I WILL NEVER REPEAT AND THAT IS SHE SAID WITH THE SMILE OF A YOUNG MOTHER LISTENING TO SOME FOOLISH NOTION OF HER CHILD IT IS THIS THAT EVER SINCE I HAVE SEEN YOU I KNOW NOT WHY
WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME BECAUSE MARGUERITE MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO AND WHY DID YOU NOT ASK ME FOR MONEY BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T LET ME AND WHERE HAS THIS MONEY GONE IN PAYMENTS
SAID SHE TURNING TO PRUDENCE AND SPEAKING IN A BROKEN VOICE YOU CAN REPORT THIS SCENE TO THE DUKE AND YOU CAN ADD THAT WE HAVE NO LONGER NEED OF HIM FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE DUKE WAS NEVER REFERRED TO
I HAD TAKEN HER CURE IN HAND AND THE POOR GIRL SEEING MY AIM OBEYED ME IN ORDER TO PROVE HER GRATITUDE I HAD SUCCEEDED WITHOUT EFFORT OR TROUBLE IN ALMOST ISOLATING HER FROM HER FORMER HABITS MY DOCTOR
MOUNTING AS HIGH AS THE FIRST STORY I LOOKED AT THE HOUSE SO LONG THAT I BEGAN BY THINKING OF IT AS MINE SO PERFECTLY DID IT EMBODY THE DREAM THAT I WAS DREAMING I SAW MARGUERITE AND MYSELF THERE
MARGUERITE ATE HER RAISINS GLACES WITHOUT TAKING ANY MORE NOTICE OF ME THE FRIEND WHO HAD INTRODUCED ME DID NOT WISH TO LET ME REMAIN IN SO RIDICULOUS A POSITION MARGUERITE HE SAID YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED IF
I FLUNG MYSELF INTO THIS RAPID NOISY AND VOLCANIC LIFE WHICH HAD FORMERLY TERRIFIED ME WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AND WHICH HAD BECOME FOR ME THE NECESSARY COMPLEMENT OF MY LOVE FOR MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE DONE
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL CONTINUED MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE IS THERE I HAVE BEEN SEEING ABOUT A PLACE FOR ARMAND TO STAY IN THE SAME HOUSE ASKED PRUDENCE LAUGHING
PRUDENCE NOW CAME BUT RARELY BUT SHE OFTEN WROTE LETTERS WHICH I NEVER ASKED TO SEE THOUGH EVERY TIME THEY CAME THEY SEEMED TO PREOCCUPY MARGUERITE DEEPLY I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK
I WISHED ABOVE ALL NOT TO LEAVE MYSELF TIME TO THINK OVER THE POSITION I HAD ACCEPTED FOR IN SPITE OF MYSELF IT WAS A GREAT DISTRESS TO ME THUS MY LIFE GENERALLY SO CALM
THE DUKE WROTE TO HER TWO OR THREE TIMES SHE RECOGNISED THE WRITING AND GAVE ME THE LETTERS WITHOUT READING THEM SOMETIMES THE TERMS OF THESE LETTERS BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES HE HAD IMAGINED THAT BY CLOSING HIS PURSE TO MARGUERITE
UNDER THE PRETEXT THAT SHE WAS ASLEEP AND HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BE AWAKENED THE HABIT OR THE NEED OF SEEING ME WHICH MARGUERITE HAD NOW CONTRACTED HAD THIS GOOD RESULT THAT IT FORCED ME TO LEAVE THE GAMING TABLE JUST AT THE MOMENT
THE COURTESAN DISAPPEARED LITTLE BY LITTLE I HAD BY ME A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHOM I LOVED AND WHO LOVED ME AND WHO WAS CALLED MARGUERITE THE PAST HAD NO MORE REALITY AND THE FUTURE NO MORE CLOUDS
AS IF HE WERE LISTENING TO HIS OWN THOUGHTS RATHER THAN TO WHAT I WAS SAYING I DID NOT ANSWER THEN TURNING TOWARD ME HE SAID I MUST TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
HIDDEN UNDER THE APPARENT CALM OF THE INVALID BUT ARMAND ON THE CONTRARY SEEMED TO DELIGHT IN SPEAKING OF HER NOT AS FORMERLY WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES BUT WITH A SWEET SMILE WHICH REASSURED ME AS TO THE STATE OF HIS MIND
ILLNESSES LIKE ARMAND'S HAVE ONE FORTUNATE THING ABOUT THEM THEY EITHER KILL OUTRIGHT OR ARE VERY SOON OVERCOME A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE EVENTS WHICH I HAVE JUST RELATED ARMAND WAS CONVALESCENT AND WE HAD ALREADY BECOME GREAT FRIENDS
WOULD YOU NOT SUFFER ON SEEING THE HINDRANCES SET BY YOUR LOVE TO YOUR LOVER'S LIFE HINDRANCES FOR WHICH YOU WOULD BE POWERLESS TO CONSOLE HIM IF WITH AGE THOUGHTS OF AMBITION SHOULD SUCCEED TO DREAMS OF LOVE THINK OVER ALL THAT MADAME YOU LOVE ARMAND
I ASKED HER THE CAUSE OF HER TROUBLE AND SHE ANSWERED OUR LOVE IS NOT LIKE OTHER LOVES MY ARMAND
ANOTHER FEELING HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF ME IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD HER INSULT AND MY ABSURDITY TO WIPE OUT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IF I SPENT EVERY PENNY I HAD I WOULD WIN HER AND WIN MY RIGHT TO THE PLACE I HAD ABANDONED SO QUICKLY
IT HAS BEEN JUST THE SAME EVER SINCE I SAW YOU WELL FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND DO NOT LIVE AS YOU ARE LIVING NOW IF I TOOK CARE OF MYSELF I SHOULD DIE
AND I HAD COME TO LIVE ENTIRELY AT HER HOUSE THE SERVANTS ADDRESSED ME OFFICIALLY AS THEIR MASTER PRUDENCE HAD STRICTLY SERMONIZED MARGUERITE IN REGARD TO HER NEW MANNER OF LIFE BUT SHE HAD REPLIED THAT SHE LOVED ME THAT SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT ME
SAID NANINE AS SHE SAW US ENTER SHE HAS GONE AGAIN ASKED MARGUERITE YES MADAME IN THE CARRIAGE SHE SAID IT WAS ARRANGED QUITE RIGHT SAID MARGUERITE SHARPLY
AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF TWO TEARS FELL UPON IT WHY WHAT A CHILD YOU ARE SHE SAID SITTING DOWN BY MY SIDE AGAIN YOU ARE CRYING WHAT IS THE MATTER
THAT IS NOT THE WAY I SAID WE MUST GO AND GET SOME SWEETS SHE ASKED ME FOR SOME WE WENT INTO A CONFECTIONER'S IN THE PASSAGE DE L'OPERA I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE WHOLE SHOP AND I WAS LOOKING ABOUT TO SEE WHAT SWEETS TO CHOOSE WHEN MY FRIEND ASKED FOR A POUND OF RAISINS GLACES
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN NEXT DAY MARGUERITE SENT ME AWAY VERY EARLY SAYING THAT THE DUKE WAS COMING AT AN EARLY HOUR AND PROMISING TO WRITE TO ME THE MOMENT HE WENT AND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE EVENING
IT WAS NO DOUBT A MERE CHANCE BUT THE CHANCE FILLED ME WITH DELIGHT FROM THAT TIME FORWARD I OFTEN MET MARGUERITE AT THE THEATRE OR
AND PRUDENCE APPEARED TO BE ENCHANTED WITH HER ADVICE WHICH I REFUSED INDIGNANTLY NOT ONLY MY LOVE AND MY DIGNITY WOULD NOT LET ME ACT THUS BUT I WAS CERTAIN THAT FEELING AS SHE DID NOW
THOSE WHO SET HER IN MOTION YOUR FATHER HAD WRITTEN ME A VERY POLITE LETTER IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT CONSENT TO SEE HIM HE DID NOT PRESENT HIMSELF QUITE AS HE HAD WRITTEN HIS MANNER AT FIRST WAS SO STIFF INSOLENT AND EVEN THREATENING
HE HAS ASKED ME HOW I LOVING PARIS AS I DO COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO BURY MYSELF IN THE COUNTRY I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS ILL AND THAT I WANTED REST HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING ME
WHETHER THIS MUTUAL LOVE MEANS HAPPINESS TO HIM AND REDEMPTION TO YOU
HOWEVER MARGUERITE'S PLEASURE IN SEEING HER FRIENDS WAS A LITTLE MODERATED WHEN SHE SAW THE EXPENSE WHICH THAT PLEASURE ENTAILED AND ESPECIALLY THE NECESSITY SHE WAS SOMETIMES IN OF ASKING ME FOR MONEY THE DUKE
WILL YOU GO ABROAD I WILL SELL ALL THAT I HAVE WE WILL GO AND LIVE THERE
I COULD NOT REMAIN IN THE CORRIDOR AND I RETURNED TO MY PLACE IN THE STALLS LOOKING HASTILY AROUND TO SEE WHAT BOX SHE WAS IN SHE WAS IN A GROUND FLOOR BOX QUITE ALONE SHE HAD CHANGED AS I HAVE TOLD YOU
ON THE TABLE WAS A BASIN HALF FULL OF WATER AND THE WATER WAS STAINED WITH STREAKS OF BLOOD VERY PALE HER MOUTH HALF OPEN MARGUERITE TRIED TO RECOVER BREATH
IF MARGUERITE HAS NOT BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO YOU TWENTY TIMES IT IS BECAUSE SHE HAS AN EXCEPTIONAL NATURE IT IS NOT MY FAULT FOR NOT ADVISING HER TO FOR I COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE THE POOR GIRL STRIPPING HERSELF OF EVERYTHING
AND THAT HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE THAT LET MARGUERITE LEAVE THE YOUNG MAN HE SAID TO ME AND AS IN THE PAST I WILL GIVE HER ALL THAT SHE REQUIRES IF NOT LET HER ASK NOTHING MORE FROM ME
WHILE THIS OLD DUKE MIGHT DIE ANY DAY OLD MEN ARE EGOISTS HIS FAMILY ARE ALWAYS REPROACHING HIM FOR HIS AFFECTION FOR MARGUERITE THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY HE IS LIKELY TO LEAVE HER NOTHING I GIVE HER GOOD ADVICE
ENOUGH JOKING I SAID TO PRUDENCE TELL ME EXACTLY HOW MUCH MARGUERITE IS IN NEED OF I HAVE TOLD YOU THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS AND WHEN DOES SHE REQUIRE THIS SUM
IT IS TRUE I AM NOTHING TO YOU I WENT ON BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME I WILL LOOK AFTER YOU LIKE A BROTHER I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIDE AND I WILL CURE YOU THEN
STILL THE CARRIAGE DID NOT RETURN HOW IS IT THAT PRUDENCE DOES NOT SEND YOU BACK YOUR CARRIAGE I ASKED ONE DAY ONE OF THE HORSES IS ILL AND THERE ARE SOME REPAIRS TO BE DONE
EITHER I SHALL NOT ACCEPT THEN YOU WILL HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST ME OR I SHALL ACCEPT THEN YOU WILL HAVE A SORRY MISTRESS A WOMAN WHO IS NERVOUS ILL SAD OR GAY WITH A GAIETY SADDER THAN GRIEF
I TOOK UP MY POSITION AT THE MAISON D'OR IN ONE OF THE FIRST FLOOR ROOMS AND DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE WINDOW FOR AN INSTANT AT ONE IN THE MORNING MARGUERITE GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE WITH HER THREE FRIENDS I TOOK A CAB AND FOLLOWED THEM
AND THE SORT OF LIFE SHE LEADS ISN'T EXACTLY THE THING TO CURE HER SHE HAS TAKEN TO HER BED
I THEREFORE SAID TO MY FRIEND THAT I INSISTED ON HAVING HER PERMISSION TO BE INTRODUCED TO HER AND I WANDERED TO AND FRO IN THE CORRIDORS SAYING TO MYSELF THAT IN A MOMENT'S TIME SHE WAS GOING TO SEE ME AND THAT I SHOULD NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO LOOK
MARGUERITE'S NATURE WAS VERY CAPRICIOUS AND LIKE SO MANY WOMEN SHE NEVER REGARDED AS A SERIOUS EXPENSE THOSE THOUSAND AND ONE DISTRACTIONS WHICH MADE UP HER LIFE SO WISHING TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH ME AS POSSIBLE
BY SACRIFICING YOUR LOVE TO HIS FUTURE NO MISFORTUNE HAS YET ARRIVED BUT ONE WILL ARRIVE AND PERHAPS A GREATER ONE THAN THOSE WHICH I FORESEE
AFTER ALL WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME I SAID AFFECTING TO SPEAK IN A NONCHALANT WAY I SHALL NEVER SEE THIS WOMAN AGAIN AND IF I LIKED HER BEFORE MEETING HER IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT NOW THAT I KNOW HER BAH
WHO SHOULD BE YOUNG AND NOT SELF WILLED LOVING WITHOUT DISTRUST LOVED WITHOUT CLAIMING THE RIGHT TO IT I HAVE NEVER FOUND ONE MEN
PRUDENCE RANG THE PIANO WAS SILENT A WOMAN WHO LOOKED MORE LIKE A COMPANION THAN A SERVANT OPENED THE DOOR WE WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND FROM THAT TO THE BOUDOIR WHICH WAS THEN JUST AS YOU HAVE SEEN IT SINCE
AND HAVING FALLEN UPON A PARTY OF FIFTEEN WHO WERE STILL AT LUNCH AT AN HOUR WHEN HE WAS PREPARED TO SIT DOWN TO DINNER HE HAD UNSUSPECTINGLY OPENED THE DINING ROOM DOOR AND HAD BEEN GREETED BY A BURST OF LAUGHTER
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I LOVE YOUR SON
VERY MUCH KEPT MY DEAR FELLOW DON'T BE SHY SAY ANYTHING THAT COMES INTO YOUR HEAD YES YES I STAMMERED AND I FOLLOWED HIM SAYING TO MYSELF
THE BODY WAS TOO MUCH WEAKENED BY THE ATTACK OF FEVER AND EVEN BY THE PROCESS OF ITS CURE TO PERMIT HIM ANY VIOLENT EMOTIONS AND THE UNIVERSAL JOY OF SPRING WHICH WRAPPED HIM ROUND CARRIED HIS THOUGHTS INSTINCTIVELY TO IMAGES OF JOY
BECAUSE THE COMTE DE N IS STILL HERE AND HE IS BORING ME TO DEATH I CAN'T NOW WHAT IS HINDERING YOU THERE ARE TWO YOUNG FELLOWS HERE WHO WON'T GO
HE HAD ALWAYS OBSTINATELY REFUSED TO TELL HIS FAMILY OF THE DANGER WHICH HE HAD BEEN IN AND WHEN HE WAS WELL AGAIN HIS FATHER DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT HE HAD BEEN ILL ONE EVENING WE HAD SAT AT THE WINDOW LATER THAN USUAL
MARGUERITE ROSE FROM TABLE AND JOINED THE DUKE IN THE NEXT ROOM WHERE SHE TRIED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO INDUCE HIM TO FORGET THE INCIDENT BUT THE OLD MAN WOUNDED IN HIS DIGNITY BORE HER A GRUDGE FOR IT
AH YOU THINK IT IS ENOUGH TO BE IN LOVE AND TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY AND LEAD A DREAMY PASTORAL LIFE NO MY FRIEND NO BY THE SIDE OF THAT IDEAL LIFE THERE IS A MATERIAL LIFE
HAVE VERY SOON LEFT ME I DID NOT ANSWER I LISTENED THIS FRANKNESS WHICH WAS ALMOST A KIND OF CONFESSION THE SAD LIFE OF WHICH I CAUGHT SOME GLIMPSE THROUGH THE GOLDEN VEIL WHICH COVERED IT
IS SHE MUCH IN DEBT THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS OR THEREABOUTS AH MY DEAR FELLOW DIDN'T I TELL YOU YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME NOW YOU ARE CONVINCED
I HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU FOR TEN MINUTES SAID MARGUERITE FROM HER WINDOW IN ALMOST AN IMPERIOUS TONE OF VOICE WHAT DO YOU WANT I WANT YOU TO COME OVER AT ONCE WHY
WE AGAIN HEARD MARGUERITE'S VOICE CALLING TO PRUDENCE WHO RUSHED TO HER DRESSING ROOM WINDOW I FOLLOWED WITH GASTON AS SHE OPENED THE WINDOW WE HID OURSELVES SO AS NOT TO BE SEEN FROM OUTSIDE
MY FATHER WAS AND STILL IS RECEVEUR GENERAL AT C HE HAS A GREAT REPUTATION THERE FOR LOYALTY THANKS TO WHICH HE WAS ABLE TO FIND THE SECURITY WHICH HE NEEDED IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THIS POSITION
AND BEHIND THE HOUSE A LITTLE WOOD FULL OF MYSTERIOUS RETREATS WHERE THE MOSS MUST EFFACE EACH MORNING THE PATHWAY THAT HAD BEEN MADE THE DAY BEFORE CLIMBING FLOWERS CLUNG ABOUT THE DOORWAY OF THIS UNINHABITED HOUSE
I TOOK IT WAS I RIGHT I FLUNG MY ARMS AROUND HER NECK AND KISSED HER IT WILL BE CHARMING SHE CONTINUED YOU HAVE THE KEY OF THE LITTLE DOOR AND I HAVE PROMISED THE DUKE THE KEY OF THE FRONT DOOR
BUT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THE PATIENCE THAT YOU PRETEND TO PERMIT ME TO SAY MARGUERITE THAT YOU WERE ILL FOR TWO MONTHS AND THAT FOR TWO MONTHS I CAME TO ASK AFTER YOU EVERY DAY IT IS TRUE BUT WHY DID YOU NOT COME UP
I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU ALL THIS ONCE ONLY AT THAT TIME IT WAS MERELY ADVICE AND NOW IT IS ALMOST A NECESSITY WHAT PRUDENCE SAID WAS CRUELLY TRUE
OUTSIDE SUSSE'S AN OPEN CARRIAGE WAS STATIONED THERE AND A WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE GOT DOWN FROM IT A MURMUR OF ADMIRATION GREETED HER AS SHE ENTERED THE SHOP AS FOR ME I WAS RIVETTED TO THE SPOT FROM THE MOMENT SHE WENT IN TILL THE MOMENT WHEN SHE CAME OUT AGAIN
AND WHEN I JOINED THEM THEY CHANGED THE CONVERSATION
SHE WOULD WRITE TO ME IN THE MORNING THAT SHE WOULD DINE WITH ME NOT AT HOME BUT AT SOME RESTAURANT IN PARIS OR IN THE COUNTRY I WOULD CALL FOR HER AND WE WOULD DINE AND GO ON TO THE THEATRE OFTEN HAVING SUPPER AS WELL
FOR WHICH GOD WILL REWARD YOU BUT I GREATLY FEAR THAT YOU WILL HAVE NO INFLUENCE UPON MY SON OH BE AT REST SIR HE WILL HATE ME I HAD TO SET UP BETWEEN US AS MUCH FOR ME AS FOR YOU AN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER
AS BEFORE NO MATTER ON WHAT CONDITIONS I READ THESE URGENT AND REPEATED LETTERS AND TORE THEM IN PIECES WITHOUT TELLING MARGUERITE WHAT THEY CONTAINED AND WITHOUT ADVISING HER TO SEE THE OLD MAN AGAIN
POOR THING I AM KILLING HER AND NOW GENTLEMEN IT IS TIME TO GO TEN MINUTES AFTER GASTON AND I LEFT THE HOUSE MARGUERITE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AND SAID GOOD BYE
BUT ONLY TO BRING IN OUR MEALS AND EVEN THESE WE TOOK WITHOUT GETTING UP
BUT IF I AM TO SAY IT TO YOU ONE DAY IT IS NOT TO DAY YOU WILL DO BETTER NEVER TO SAY IT WHY BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF TWO THINGS CAN COME OF IT WHAT
ONLY ONE OF MY CHILDREN THE RECOMPENSE THAT I LOOK FOR FROM BOTH YOU ARE YOUNG BEAUTIFUL LIFE WILL CONSOLE YOU YOU ARE NOBLE
WHERE THERE IS STILL A CERTAIN RIGOUR IN REGARD TO PAYMENTS ONE IS ALMOST CERTAIN THE MOMENT ONE GAINS A CONSIDERABLE SUM NOT TO RECEIVE IT YOU WILL READILY UNDERSTAND WHY GAMBLING IS ONLY LIKELY TO BE CARRIED ON BY YOUNG PEOPLE
BEFORE THE END OF TWO MONTHS SHE SHALL HAVE IT PRUDENCE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU I CONTINUED BUT YOU MUST SWEAR TO ME THAT YOU WILL NOT TELL MARGUERITE THAT I HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU
IF THAT WILL AMUSE YOU THE LEAST IN THE WORLD AFTER ALL NO SHE SAID LEAVING THE WINDOW AND GOING TO SIT DOWN ON THE SOFA AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WHY SHOULD WE SPEND MONEY ABROAD I COST YOU ENOUGH ALREADY HERE
LET US GO AND SEE IF IT IS TO LET THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY AND TO LET FOR TWO THOUSAND FRANCS WOULD YOU BE HAPPY HERE SHE SAID TO ME AM I SURE OF COMING HERE
AND YOU REPLIED THAT I WOULD REPORT HIS DECISION TO YOU AND I PROMISED HIM THAT I WOULD BRING YOU INTO A MORE REASONABLE FRAME OF MIND ONLY THINK MY DEAR CHILD OF THE POSITION THAT YOU ARE LOSING
PRUDENCE WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO SEEM MADE ON PURPOSE FOR DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WITH HER UNCHANGING GOOD HUMOUR AND HER ETERNAL APPETITE SHE NEVER LEFT A DULL MOMENT TO THOSE WHOM SHE WAS WITH AND WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY IN ORDERING EGGS CHERRIES MILK
AND ALL THE SIMPLICITY OF ITS DEVELOPMENTS I REALIZED THEN THAT AS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD MAKE ME FORGET MY MISTRESS IT WAS NEEDFUL FOR ME TO FIND SOME WAY OF MEETING THE EXPENSES INTO WHICH SHE DREW ME THEN TOO
WAS ONE OF THOSE FAT WOMEN OF FORTY WITH WHOM ONE REQUIRES VERY LITTLE DIPLOMACY TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT ONE WANTS TO KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN WHAT ONE WANTS TO KNOW IS AS SIMPLE AS WHAT I HAD TO ASK OF HER
AND ASKS IF HE WILL COME HOME WITH HER
I SAID UNABLE TO CONTAIN MYSELF ANY LONGER I DO NOT KNOW WHAT INFLUENCE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE OVER MY LIFE BUT AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT THERE IS NO ONE NOT EVEN MY SISTER IN WHOM I FEEL THE INTEREST WHICH I FEEL IN YOU
FOR I AM WORTH VERY LITTLE YOU HAVE A GOOD HEART YOU WANT SOME ONE TO LOVE YOU YOU ARE TOO YOUNG AND TOO SENSITIVE TO LIVE IN A WORLD LIKE MINE TAKE A MARRIED WOMAN YOU SEE
I KNOW WOMEN BETTER THAN YOU DO DO NOT COMMIT THIS FOLLY YOU WILL BE SORRY FOR IT ONE DAY BE REASONABLE I DON'T ADVISE YOU TO LEAVE MARGUERITE BUT LIVE WITH HER AS YOU DID AT THE BEGINNING
HE CALLS HER HIS DAUGHTER LOOKS AFTER HER LIKE A CHILD AND IS ALWAYS IN THE WAY I AM SURE AT THIS VERY MOMENT ONE OF HIS SERVANTS IS PROWLING ABOUT IN THE STREET TO SEE WHO COMES OUT AND ESPECIALLY WHO GOES IN AH
BUT HE CAN NOT ACCEPT THIS SACRIFICE BECAUSE THE WORLD WHICH DOES NOT KNOW YOU WOULD GIVE A WRONG INTERPRETATION TO THIS ACCEPTANCE AND SUCH AN INTERPRETATION MUST NOT TARNISH THE NAME WHICH WE BEAR NO ONE WOULD CONSIDER WHETHER ARMAND LOVES YOU WHETHER YOU LOVE HIM
I COULD NOT HELP SAYING HAPPY MAN WHY TO GO AND SEE THAT WOMAN ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER NO I SAID FLUSHING FOR I REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY BUT I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO KNOW HER COME WITH ME I WILL INTRODUCE YOU
WITH A DISINTERESTED LOVE YES DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I HAD MADE THIS LOVE THE HOPE THE DREAM THE FORGIVENESS OF MY LIFE IMPLICITLY
THAT MY PAST LIFE LEFT ME NO RIGHT TO DREAM OF SUCH A FUTURE AND THAT I WAS ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR WHICH MY HABITS AND REPUTATION WERE FAR FROM GIVING ANY GUARANTEE
YOU WILL TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT LATER ON MY FRIEND I SAID TO HIM YOU ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH YET IT IS A WARM EVENING I HAVE EATEN MY RATION OF CHICKEN HE SAID TO ME SMILING
ALL THAT SUPPORTS ME IS THE FEVERISH LIFE I LEAD THEN AS FOR TAKING CARE OF ONESELF THAT IS ALL VERY WELL FOR WOMEN WITH FAMILIES AND FRIENDS AS FOR US
I WOULD RATHER FOR YOU TO INTRODUCE ME TO HER AT HER OWN HOUSE YES THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT WHY BECAUSE SHE IS UNDER THE PROTECTION OF A JEALOUS OLD DUKE PROTECTION IS CHARMING
YOU MAY PERHAPS PARDON THE ALLUSION MADAM WHEN YOU HAVE HEARD WHAT I HAVE STILL TO SAY I OWE IT TO MISTER HERBERT LINLEY IF NOT TO YOU TO CONFESS THAT HIS LIFE WITH ME HAS NOT BEEN A LIFE OF HAPPINESS
WITHOUT AN OBJECT TO HINDER ITS PASSAGE AT ANY POINT OF THE COMPASS THE LONELY DRAB COLORED ROAD THAT LED TO THE NEAREST TOWN OFFERED TO VISITORS TAKING AIRINGS
THEY ARE THE RESULT OF A PROMISE MADE MANY YEARS SINCE TO HIS WIFE YOU AND I WERE BOTH VERY YOUNG WHEN MY POOR MOTHER DIED BUT I THINK YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT SHE LIKE THE REST OF HER FAMILY WAS A ROMAN CATHOLIC HAVING REMINDED YOU OF THIS
THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE NEWSPAPER SHE SAID WHICH YOU DON'T WANT ME TO READ HE DENIED IT
THIS IS MEAN SAID MISSUS PRESTY KEEPING THAT WRETCH'S PRESENT AFTER THE PUBLIC EXPOSURE WHICH HE HAS FORCED ON YOU OH CATHERINE CATHERINE WAS NOT QUITE SO PATIENT WITH HER MOTHER AS USUAL
WHEN SHE CAUGHT YOU SEARCHING MY POCKETS FOR SWEETMEATS SHE ACCUSED ME OF DESTROYING YOUR DIGESTION BEFORE YOU WERE FIVE YEARS OLD I WENT ON SPOILING IT FOR ALL THAT THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU MY CHILD YOUR FATHER WAS SINGING THE MARINERS OF ENGLAND
KITTY WAS SENT FOR SHE ENTERED THE ROOM LOOKING UNUSUALLY QUIET AND SUBDUED BUT DISCOVERING RANDAL BECAME HERSELF AGAIN IN A MOMENT AND JUMPED ON HIS KNEE OH UNCLE RANDAL I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU
OF COURSE AND PERHAPS YOU TAKE YOUR BROTHER'S PART I DO NOTHING OF THE SORT MA'AM MY BROTHER HAS BEEN IN THE WRONG FROM FIRST TO LAST HE TURNED TO CATHERINE
OF THE VIRTUES WHICH MIGHT HAVE MADE THE HAPPINESS OF MY LIFE BUT HE WAS BOUND TO REMEMBER AND HE DID REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS NOW A NEW INTEREST TENDERLY ASSOCIATING ITSELF WITH HIS LIFE TO COME
MORE CHANGES MET ME THE MOMENT I OPENED THE DOOR CHANGES FOR THE BETTER MY DEAR IT COULDN'T HAVE CHANGED FOR THE WORSE
HERBERT IS PINING TO SEE KITTY HE CONTINUED AND I MEAN TO HELP HIM
RANDAL LINLEY HAD SAID TO MISSUS PRESTY
HE MUST CERTAINLY HAVE HEARD A MAN'S VOICE RAISED IN ANGER WHEN HE APPROACHED THE DOOR AND HE WAS NOW OBSERVING THAT MAN WITH AN AIR OF CURIOSITY WHICH WAS ALREADY ASSUMING THE APPEARANCE OF DISTRUST
AS SHE HATED HIM AT THAT MOMENT THE CAPTAIN WENT ON WITH HIS EXPLANATION HE HAD HIS REASONS HE SAID FOR HESITATING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO PRESENT HIMSELF UNINVITED
RICH MISSUS ROMSEY CONNECTED WITH COMMERCE AS WIFE OF THE CHIEF PARTNER IN THE FIRM OF ROMSEY AND RENSHAW WAS STAYING AT THE HOTEL IN THE INTERESTS OF HER THREE CHILDREN THEY WERE OF DELICATE CONSTITUTION
HE COULD ONLY SAY WHAT WE HAVE ALL SAID HOW SINCERELY HOW SORROWFULLY WE ALL KNOW THE COMMON WORD GOOD BY THE COMMON WISH GOD BLESS YOU AT THAT LAST MOMENT
ARE YOU AND RANDAL LINLEY INTIMATE FRIENDS HE INQUIRED AS SOON AS HE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF MOST INTIMATE IT'S STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE MENTIONED ME
PERHAPS THE REPORT IS NOT TRUE AS YOU DON'T READ THE NEWSPAPERS ALLOW ME TO REPEAT IT YOU ARE ENGAGED TO MARRY THE BEAUTIFUL WIDOW MISSUS NORMAN
LEFT BY HIMSELF RANDAL GOT RID OF THE PARASOL BY PUTTING IT ON A TABLE NEAR THE DOOR MISSUS PRESTY BECKONED TO HIM TO JOIN HER AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM I WANT YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR SHE BEGAN
SHE FELT THE STRONGEST RELUCTANCE WHEN THE GIRL APPEARED TO APPROACH THE VERY INQUIRIES WHICH SHE WAS INTERESTED IN MAKING HAVE YOU FOUND MISTER LINLEY SHE SAID WITH AN EFFORT
YOU'RE DRESSED TO GO OUT SHE SAID SYDNEY TURNED AWAY TO HIDE HER FACE IT WAS TOO LATE KITTY HAD SEEN THE TEARS OH MY DARLING
THE MOMENT THE DOOR HAD CLOSED ON HIM MISSUS PRESTY STARTLED HER DAUGHTER BY TAKING UP THE CARD AND LOOKING AT WHAT RANDAL HAD WRITTEN ON IT IT ISN'T A LETTER CATHERINE AND YOU KNOW HOW SUPERIOR I AM TO COMMON PREJUDICES
THE DRESS OF THIS WONDERFUL CREATURE EXHIBITED THE LATEST AUDACITIES OF FRENCH FASHION HER HEAD MADE A BOW HER EYES WENT TO SLEEP AND WOKE AGAIN
WHEN HE TURNED NEXT TO MISSUS PRESTY OBSERVING THAT SHE WAS AGITATED HE MADE THE CUSTOMARY APOLOGIES EXPRESSING HIS REGRET IF HE HAD BEEN SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO COMMIT AN INTRUSION
MISSUS LINLEY ADDRESSED HERSELF TO HER MOTHER WHEN WE LAST MET I THOUGHT YOU SPOKE RASHLY AND CRUELLY I KNOW NOW THAT THERE WAS TRUTH SOME TRUTH LET ME SAY
CATHERINE LOOKED AT HIM TIMIDLY DO I DRIVE YOU AWAY SHE ASKED IN TONES THAT FALTERED A LITTLE RANDAL WONDERED WHAT SHE COULD POSSIBLY BE THINKING OF AND ACKNOWLEDGED IT IN SO MANY WORDS
BY THIS TIME FROM A STATE OF SUSPICION TO A STATE OF CERTAINTY MY CHILD SHE ANSWERED THEY WON'T COME AT ALL KITTY RAN TO HER MOTHER EAGER TO INQUIRE IF WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD TOLD HER COULD POSSIBLY BE TRUE
EXCEPT IN THOUGHT MISSUS LINLEY RESUMED DO YOU TELL ME THAT ON YOUR WORD OF HONOR ON MY WORD OF HONOR SO FAR HIS WIFE WAS SATISFIED MY GOVERNESS SHE SAID
ON THE POINT OF REMOVING THE LETTERS NEXT SHE NOTICED THE NEWSPAPER ON THE TABLE ANYTHING INTERESTING TO DAY SHE ASKED AND DREW THE NEWSPAPER TOWARD HER TO LOOK AT IT HE TOOK IT FROM HER SUDDENLY ALMOST ROUGHLY
MISTER ROMSEY WENT ON WITH HIS INQUIRIES IS SHE A HANDSOME WOMAN BOTH THE LADIES ANSWERED THE QUESTION TOGETHER LADY MYRIE DESCRIBED MISSUS NORMAN
HE SAID YES ONCE MORE AND KEPT HIS FACE STEADILY TURNED AWAY FROM HER SHE WAITED A WHILE HE NEITHER MOVED NOR SPOKE SURVIVING THE SLOW DEATH LITTLE BY LITTLE OF ALL HER OTHER ILLUSIONS
THAT HE HAD INFLICTED ON THE FAMILY RECURRED TO HIS MEMORY HE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND RANDAL'S OTHERWISE UNACCOUNTABLE SILENCE ARE YOU NEARLY RELATED TO MISTER RANDAL LINLEY THE CAPTAIN ASKED
YOU WERE HIS FAVORITE PUPIL DO YOU REMEMBER HIM I SHOULD BE UNGRATEFUL INDEED IF I COULD FORGET HIM
THE LARGEST NATURE THE LONGEST LOVE MISSUS PRESTY WAITED IN THE GARDEN TO BE JOINED BY HER DAUGHTER AND CAPTAIN BENNYDECK AND WAITED IN VAIN IT WAS PAST HER GRANDCHILD'S BEDTIME
AND I HEARD OF IT THE CAPTAIN REPLIED
SOMETIMES SEEING THE CAPTAIN'S YACHT BUT TO OUR GREAT SURPRISE NEVER SEEING THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF THERE'S NOTHING TO BE SURPRISED AT MISSUS PRESTY CAPTAIN BENNYDECK LIKES DOING KIND THINGS AND HATES BEING THANKED FOR IT
HE SAID EARNESTLY AND KINDLY THE TRUTH IS I AM ON MY WAY TO VISIT SOME FRIENDS AND IF CAPTAIN BENNYDECK HAD GOT HERE IN TIME TO SEE ME I MUST HAVE GONE AWAY TO THE JUNCTION TO CATCH THE NEXT TRAIN WESTWARD
FOR MY SAKE SHE LOOKED AT HIM HARDLY ABLE TO UNDERSTAND OR AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERHAPS AFRAID TO UNDERSTAND HIM HE SPOKE TO HER MORE PLAINLY I HAVE KEPT IT CONCEALED FROM YOU HE CONTINUED
HER MISTRESS TOLD HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SENT HER TO THE PALACE TO RELIEVE CAPTAIN BENNYDECK OF THE CHARGE THAT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN SUSAN LISTENED LOOKING AT SYDNEY AND RECOGNIZING THE FAMILIAR FACE
WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SHOWED HIS DISLIKE OF THAT LADY A LITTLE TOO PLAINLY BEFORE HE COULD ANSWER WHAT SHE HAD JUST SAID TO HIM HIS LIVELY LITTLE NIECE HIT ON A NEW IDEA
LADY MYRIE PRONOUNCED SENTENCE WITHOUT HESITATION OF COURSE YOUR GIRLS MUSTN'T GO DAUGHTERS THINK OF THEIR REPUTATIONS WHEN THEY GROW UP
WAS IT SOMETHING YOU HAD LEFT BEHIND YOU HE SAID AT THE TIME WHEN YOU LODGED THERE YES YOU ARE RIGHT AT THE FIRST GUESS A LITTLE MEMORIAL OF MY FATHER
I SHALL LEAVE THE INTERESTS OF MY CONTEMPLATED HOME IN YOUR HONEST AND CAPABLE HANDS FOR THE PRESENT GOOD BY AND A PROSPEROUS VOYAGE OUTWARD BOUND SO THE LETTER ENDED
THE REPLY ONLY INCREASED HIS PERPLEXITY OBSERVE MISS WESTERFIELD AND YOUR BROTHER LOOK AT THEM NOW RANDAL OBEYED WHAT IS THERE TO LOOK AT HE INQUIRED CAN'T YOU SEE
I MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO LEAVE HIM IF HE HAD LOVED ME AS HE ONCE LOVED YOU MISS WESTERFIELD YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON LIVING WHO OUGHT TO ALLUDE TO MY MARRIED LIFE
THIS PART OF HER LETTER WAS NECESSARILY A REPETITION OF WHAT BENNYDECK HAD READ IN THE CONFESSION
SHE WATCHED CATHERINE ATTENTIVELY
PRESENTING COMMENTS ON THE TRIAL WRITTEN IN THE TONE OF LOFTY AND VIRTUOUS REGRET
THE DOLL WAS PUT INTO THE PERAMBULATOR AND WAS WHEELED ABOUT THE ROOM WHILE MISSUS LINLEY MOVED THE CHAIRS OUT OF THE WAY AND RANDAL ATTENDED WITH THE OPEN PARASOL UNDER ORDERS TO PRETEND THAT THE SUN WAS SHINING
RECOGNITION OF THE WOMAN WAS IMPOSSIBLE SHE NEITHER MOVED NOR SPOKE STRAINED TO THEIR UTMOST POINT OF TENSION CATHERINE'S NERVES QUIVERED AT THE SIGHT OF THAT SHADOWY SOLITARY FIGURE
AS THE GIRL MOVED AWAY SYDNEY SPOKE TO HER I HOPE LITTLE KITTY IS WELL AND HAPPY THE MOTHER DOES NOT LIVE WHO COULD HAVE RESISTED THE TONE IN WHICH THAT QUESTION WAS PUT THE BROKEN HEART THE LOVE FOR THE CHILD
AND THAT RIVAL IS YOUR GOVERNESS TAKE YOUR OWN COURSE NOW I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY WITH HER HEAD HIGH IN THE AIR LOOKING THE PICTURE OF CONSCIOUS VIRTUE THE OLD LADY WALKED OUT
INDEPENDENT OF RESTRAINT EXPRESSED HER OPINION AND SAID QUITE IMPOSSIBLE THE MISSUS NORMAN WHOM I MEAN MISTER ROMSEY WENT ON HAS AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD
FOR THE FIRST TIME CATHERINE SAW HER CHILD TREMBLING AT THE SIGHT OF HER BEFORE THAT DISCOVERY THE EMOTIONS THAT SHOOK HER UNDER THE INSULT WHICH SHE HAD RECEIVED LOST THEIR HOLD
ANSWERS THIS QUESTION AND TELLS A VERY SAD STORY IN DEFERENCE TO MY MOTHER'S WISHES IT WAS KEPT STRICTLY A SECRET FROM ME WHILE MY FATHER LIVED THERE WAS A YOUNGER SISTER OF MY MOTHER'S WHO WAS THE BEAUTY OF THE FAMILY
YES MA'AM WHERE DID YOU FIND HIM IN THE SHRUBBERY DID YOUR MASTER SAY ANYTHING I SLIPPED AWAY MA'AM BEFORE HE SAW ME WHY MISS WESTERFIELD WAS IN THE SHRUBBERY WITH MY MASTER
GONE FOREVER MISSUS PRESTY HEARD HIM AND ANSWERED HIM
HE WENT ON TO THE WINDOW TO DIVERT HIS MIND AND SO TO CLEAR HIS FACE
HAS SHE TAKEN YOUR LOVE FROM ME JUDGE FOR YOURSELF CATHERINE IF THERE IS NO PROOF OF MY LOVE FOR YOU IN WHAT I HAVE RESISTED AND NO REMEMBRANCE OF ALL THAT I OWE TO YOU IN WHAT I HAVE CONFESSED
INDUSTRY AND GOOD TEMPER WHILE SHE HAS BEEN GOVERNESS TO MY CHILD SHE LEAVES HER SITUATION IN MY SERVICE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH TESTIFY TO HER SENSE OF DUTY AND HER SENSE OF GRATITUDE HAVE I SAID SHE ASKED
IF I HEAR THEM TALKING I SHALL TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS TO BED
IS THE GOOD OLD MAN STILL LIVING NO HE RESTS AT LAST I AM GLAD TO SAY I WAS ABLE TO MAKE HIS LAST DAYS ON EARTH THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF HIS LIFE I WONDER SYDNEY CONFESSED
BENNYDECK LET THE MATTER REST THERE STRUCK BY THE REMARKABLE APPEARANCE OF EMBARRASSMENT IN MISSUS PRESTY'S MANNER AND FEELING IN SPITE OF HERBERT'S POLITENESS OF LANGUAGE
KITTY WHISPERED AGAIN I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING
I SAY IT IN NO UNKINDNESS TO YOU SHE RESUMED BUT WHEN YOU ASK ME TO FORGIVE CONSIDER WHAT YOU ASK ME TO FORGET IT WILL ONLY DISTRESS US BOTH IF WE REMAIN LONGER TOGETHER SHE CONTINUED RISING AS SHE SPOKE
BUT SHE COULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT LOOKING WELL I HAVE NOTICED IT FOR SOME TIME PAST SHE CONFESSED YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY I AM AFRAID LONDON DOESN'T AGREE WITH YOU
OF HIS STILL HOLDING HIMSELF BOUND BY HIS MARRIAGE ENGAGEMENT IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE
THAT NO CONDEMNATION OF THE CONDUCT OF THE HUSBAND AND THE GOVERNESS
I BEG YOUR PARDON IF I HAVE VENTURED TO HOPE I DARE NOT ASK YOU TO ALTER YOUR OPINION DO YOU DARE TO LOOK THE TRUTH IN THE FACE CATHERINE INTERPOSED
DIDN'T YOU SAY SHE WAS GOING AWAY TO MORROW THAT'S THE WORST OF IT MISSUS ROMSEY DECLARED HER LITTLE GIRL KITTY GIVES A FAREWELL DINNER TO MORROW TO OUR CHILDREN AND I'VE PROMISED TO TAKE THEM TO SAY GOOD BY
ADDRESSED TO MISSUS MAC EDWIN HE SAID ADDRESSED SHE ANSWERED TO THE ONLY PERSON I KNOW WHO FEELS A TRUE INTEREST IN MISS WESTERFIELD HAVE YOU NOT HEARD OF IT I REMEMBER HE SAID AND READ THE LINES THAT FOLLOWED
STILL SHRINKING INSTINCTIVELY FROM THE FIRST DOUBT OF HERBERT THAT HAD EVER ENTERED HER MIND SHE FOUND A REFUGE FROM HERSELF IN WATCHING THE ORDINARY EVENTS OF THE DAY
MY DEAR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS STUPEFYING PLACE CATHERINE ASSERTED HER OWN OPINION AGAINST HER MOTHER'S OPINION FOR THE SECOND TIME
IN JUSTICE TO THE SINCERITY OF SYDNEY'S REPENTANCE FROM MENTIONING SYDNEY'S NAME ANOTHER INSTANCE THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT BITTERLY AS HE CLOSED THE LETTER
BUT IF MY BROTHER IS LEFT UNDER THE FALSE IMPRESSION THAT YOUR ENGAGEMENT WILL BE FOLLOWED BY YOUR MARRIAGE HE WILL REFUSE TO INTRUDE HIMSELF ON THE LADY WHO WAS ONCE HIS WIFE THE CAPTAIN UNDERSTOOD SAY WHAT YOU PLEASE ABOUT ME
IN CLEANING OUT THE GARRET WHAT DO YOU THINK THE LANDLADY FOUND TRY TO GUESS ANYTHING TO PLEASE HER
SYDNEY WAS SPARED THE TORTURING DOUBTS WHICH NOW BESET HERBERT LINLEY'S MIND WOULD THE NOBLE WOMAN WHOM THEY HAD INJURED ALLOW THEIR ATONEMENT TO PLEAD FOR THEM
MISSUS PRESTY LAID THE CARD DOWN AGAIN AND OWNED THAT SHE WISHED RANDAL HAD BEEN A LITTLE MORE EXPLICIT WHO CAN IT BE SHE WONDERED
AND A STOREHOUSE FOR ROPES AND COALS BEYOND THESE OBJECTS THERE WAS NOTHING AND THIS WAS THE GREAT CHARM OF THE PLACE TO DISTRACT THE ATTENTION OF INVALIDS FOLLOWING THE DOCTOR'S DIRECTIONS AND FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
I HAVE A GREAT MIND TO KEEP THIS SHE SAID TO KITTY TILL YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO VALUE IT PROPERLY
MISSUS PRESTY RESUMED ON HER RETURN THAT LETTER THAT FATAL LETTER TO THE CAPTAIN HAS JUSTIFIED MY WORST FEARS WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME ARE WE TO DO NOW WE ARE TO LEAVE THIS HOTEL
HOW YOU MET WITH HIM THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL ROMANTIC IN MY FIRST DISCOVERY OF HIM I WAS READING THE POLICE REPORTS IN A NEWSPAPER THE POOR WRETCH WAS BROUGHT BEFORE A MAGISTRATE CHARGED WITH BREAKING A WINDOW
AND KIND MAMMA WILL SAY YES MISSUS PRESTY CHIMED IN WE WILL BREAKFAST EARLY MY PRECIOUS CHILD GOOD NIGHT KITTY WAS HALF ASLEEP WHEN HER GOVERNESS ENTERED THE ROOM AFTERWARD MUCH LATER THAN USUAL
ON THE CONTRARY HE LOOKED AS IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT INTERESTED HIM IN THE DISCOVERY OF THE NAME YOU ARE PROBABLY RELATED TO A FRIEND OF MINE HE SAID QUIETLY
PERHAPS YOU WILL BELIEVE THAT I MEAN WELL WHEN I ASK IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU NOTHING
ON THE POINT OF LEAVING THE ROOM HERBERT WAS CALLED BACK
HE WAS VERY GRATEFUL AND CAME NOW AND THEN TO THANK ME
AFTER SACRIFICING ALL THAT MAKES LIFE TRULY DECENT AND TRULY ENJOYABLE FOR A WOMAN HE HAS GOT NOTHING NOT EVEN FALSE HAPPINESS IN RETURN
WHEN HE LOOKED BACK HE SAW NOTHING BUT THE LIFE THAT HE HAD WASTED WHEN HIS THOUGHTS TURNED TO THE FUTURE THEY CONFRONTED A PROSPECT EMPTY OF ALL PROMISE TO A MAN STILL IN THE PRIME OF LIFE
MISSUS PRESTY RECOVERED THE COMMAND OF HER TEMPER ON THAT FINE MORNING HER DAUGHTER MIGHT REMAIN IN THE GARDEN UNTIL THE LUNCHEON BELL RANG LINLEY HAD ONLY TO SAY THAT HE WISHED TO SPEAK WITH HIS WIFE
HERBERT TURNED TO THE CAPTAIN I MUST HAVE YOUR PROMISE TO WAIT FOR ME HE SAID OR I DON'T LEAVE THE ROOM MAKE YOUR MIND EASY
THE SOFT MYSTERY OF TWILIGHT THE SOLEMN SILENCE OF THE SLOWLY COMING NIGHT DAUNTED CATHERINE IN THAT LONELY PLACE
AND MISSUS PRESTY LOWERED HER VOICE IF YOU WISH TO SEE KITTY SHE RESUMED ATTACKING HERBERT ON HIS WEAK SIDE IT DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON YOUR DISCRETION
HAD SHE ANY RIGHT TO MAKE THOSE DEAR FACES HER COMPANIONS IN THE FUTURE SHE HESITATED HER TEARS DROPPED ON THE PHOTOGRAPHS THEY'RE AS GOOD AS SPOILED NOW SHE THOUGHT
YOU MUST PAY THE PENALTY OF BEING A PUBLIC CHARACTER YOUR MARRIAGE IS ANNOUNCED IN THE NEWSPAPERS I SELDOM READ THE NEWSPAPERS AH INDEED
THE RETIRING VISITOR DESCENDED THE HOTEL STEPS AND WENT HIS WAY ALONG THE STREET LINLEY RETURNED TO THE NEWSPAPER WHICH HE HAD BEEN READING WHEN HIS FRIEND WAS SHOWN INTO THE ROOM
THAT SHE ACTUALLY KISSED HER HAND TO THEM AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM BENNYDECK LOOKED AFTER HER CONVINCED THAT SOME SINISTER PURPOSE WAS CONCEALED UNDER MISSUS PRESTY'S FALSE EXCUSES
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO INSIST ON AN EXPLANATION FROM MY MOTHER SHE PROCEEDED NO MATTER WHAT I MAY FEEL I MUST REMEMBER THAT SHE IS MY MOTHER I ASK YOU AGAIN
BUT I DON'T WANT HIS OPINION I WANT HIS FACTS TAKE THE PEN MY SECRETARY AND SET DOWN HIS FACTS NEVER MIND HIS REFLECTIONS PROUD AND PLEASED SYDNEY OBEYED HIM
THIS IS TOO DREADFUL MISSUS ROMSEY TOOK A MORE COMPASSIONATE VIEW OF THE DISCLOSURE SURELY THE POOR LADY IS TO BE PITIED SHE GENTLY SUGGESTED
WITH A REPUTATION HOPELESSLY LOST FACE TO FACE WITH THE TEMPTATION TO DROWN HERSELF OR POISON HERSELF AS OTHER WOMEN HAD DROWNED THEMSELVES OR POISONED THEMSELVES WHEN THE BRIGHTEST FUTURE BEFORE THEM WAS REST IN DEATH
SENSIBLE MISSUS PRESTY DELAYED THE KISS FOR A WHILE WAIT TILL YOU COME BACK AND THEN YOU CAN TELL YOUR MAMMA
SHE WAS STILL HANDSOME STILL A WOMAN TO BE ADMIRED WHILE SHE HELD HER PLACE IN THE WORLD AS HIGH AS EVER WHAT WAS THE PROSPECT BEFORE SYDNEY WESTERFIELD
HE PROCEEDED NEWSPAPER REPORTS ARE NOT ALWAYS TO BE TRUSTED DO YOU SERIOUSLY MEAN MY DEAR SIR TO MARRY MISSUS NORMAN I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT HONOR AND THAT HAPPINESS
SYDNEY FELL ON HER KNEES IN SILENCE
INVITED TO REST HERSELF IN THE HOTEL SHE ASKED LEAVE TO REMAIN WHERE SHE WAS THE MERE EFFORT OF RISING WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER NOW CATHERINE SAID THE PARTING WORDS KINDLY I BELIEVE IN YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS
HIS WIFE ADDED WILL YOU ASK HER TO COME TO ME MISSUS PRESTY KNEW HER DAUGHTER'S NATURE MISSUS PRESTY HAD BEEN WAITING NEAR AT HAND IN EXPECTATION OF THE MESSAGE WHICH SHE NOW RECEIVED TENDERLY AND RESPECTFULLY
MY IDEA IS TO INVEST IT IN THE FUNDS AND TO LET IT THRIVE AT INTEREST UNTIL I GROW OLDER AND RETIRE PERHAPS FROM SERVICE IN THE NAVY
SHE DROPPED INTO A CHAIR IF THERE WAS ANY ONE DISTINCT THOUGHT IN HER AT THAT MOMENT IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF HER HUSBAND SHE WAS EAGER TO SEE HIM SHE LONGED TO SAY TO HIM
WHAT WILL THIS CHILD DO NEXT MISSUS PRESTY EXCLAIMED KITTY TOLD THE TRUTH I CAN'T GO TO SLEEP GRANDMAMMA WHY NOT MY DARLING HER MOTHER ASKED
POSSESSED HIMSELF OF HER THOUGHTS IN SPITE OF THE LAW HE AND HE ONLY
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOUNT FOR RANDAL'S SILENCE WILL YOU THINK ME VERY INQUISITIVE HERBERT RESUMED IF I ASK WHETHER MY BROTHER APPROVES OF YOUR MARRIAGE
COULD TAKE PLACE BETWEEN MISTER AND MISSUS LINLEY IN THIS INTERVAL MISSUS PRESTY SAW HER OPPORTUNITY OF SETTING LINLEY'S AUTHORITY AT DEFIANCE BY ROUSING THE FIRST JEALOUS SUSPICION
QUIET AS IT WAS HER TONE LEFT HIM NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO TREAT HER BRUTALLY OR TO REPLY STILL LOOKING OUT AT THE STREET HE SAID YES FREE TO MARRY IF YOU LIKE SHE PERSISTED
JUST AS SHE THOUGHT OF LOOKING ROUND FOR HER DEAR SYD HER FATHER PRODUCED A NEW OUTBURST OF DELIGHT BY PRESENTING A PERAMBULATOR WORTHY OF THE DOLL
KITTY TURNED TO HER MOTHER WITH A LOOK OF ALARM WHAT'S A HUSSY SHE ASKED DOES GRANDMAMMA MEAN ME THE GREAT HOTEL CLOCK IN THE HALL STRUCK TWO AND THE CHILD'S ANXIETIES TOOK A NEW DIRECTION
KITTY SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR HER LEGS WOULD SUPPORT HER NO LONGER I THINK I SHALL FAINT SHE SAID QUITE SERIOUSLY IN THE MIDST OF THE GENERAL LAUGHTER SYDNEY SILENTLY PLACED A NEW TOY
HE ADMITTED THAT SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT STILL SPEAKING ABSENTLY STILL THINKING OF THE DIVORCE SHE LAID THE PACKET OF LETTERS AND THE POOR RELICS OF THE OLD SONG BOOK ON THE TABLE AND BENT OVER HIM TENDERLY
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SEE ALL YOUR PRESENTS EARLY IN THE MORNING LIKE MINE STILL SMARTING UNDER THE RECOLLECTION OF HER INTERVIEW WITH HER SON IN LAW MISSUS PRESTY
NO I HEARD OF THE TRIAL AND THAT'S ALL WHAT DID THE JUDGE SAY SAY LADY MYRIE REPEATED WHAT DID HE NOT SAY
THE NEAREST HOTEL TO THE TERMINUS WOULD OFFER THEM ACCOMMODATION FOR THAT NIGHT ON THE NEXT DAY THEY COULD FIND SOME QUIET PLACE IN THE COUNTRY NO MATTER WHERE SO LONG AS THEY WERE NOT DISTURBED
WHEN MY HOUSEHOLD BUSINESS IS OFF MY MIND I SHALL HOPE TO FIND YOU BOTH MORE POLITE TO EACH OTHER THAN EVER WHEN I COME BACK SHE WAS IN SUCH A FRENZY OF SUPPRESSED RAGE
WITH ITS FEW DWARF TREES AND ITS MANGY HEDGES LAY PROSTRATE UNDER THE SKY IN ALL THE DESOLATION OF SOLITARY SPACE AND LEFT THE FAMOUS RESTORATIVE AIR FREE TO BUILD UP DILAPIDATED NERVES
ONE BY ONE THE TOURISTS DISAPPEARED UNDER THE PORTICO OF THE FRONT DOOR THE EMPTY CARRIAGE WAS DRIVEN AWAY NEXT TO WATER THE HORSES AT THE VILLAGE INN SOLITUDE WAS ALL SHE COULD SEE FROM THE WINDOWS
HER VOICE SANK LOW HER FACE TURNED PALER STILL IS IT ALL OVER SHE ASKED AND IS IT PUT IN THE NEWSPAPER WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN THE DIVORCE HE WENT BACK AGAIN TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT
AND THE PRIVATE INTERVIEW WHICH HE HAD SO RUDELY INSISTED ON AS HIS SOLE PRIVILEGE WOULD ASSUREDLY TAKE PLACE THE ONE CHANCE LEFT OF STILL DEFEATING HIM ON HIS OWN GROUND
HERBERT DECLINED TO SAY WHETHER HE WOULD BE CAREFUL OR NOT HE WAS DETERMINED TO FIND OUT FIRST WITH WHAT PURPOSE BENNYDECK HAD ENTERED THE ROOM
VESSELS OF ANY IMPORTANCE KEPT WELL OUT OF THE WAY OF TREACHEROUS SHOALS AND CURRENTS LURKING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE BAY THE ANCHORAGE GROUND WAS GOOD
AN ACT OF SIN AND STILL SHE HELD HER PLACE IN HIS THOUGHTS THE MANAGER HAD TOLD HIM OF HER SUDDEN DEPARTURE FROM THE HOTEL
GIVE ME TIME TO THINK OF WHAT YOU HAVE SAID SHE PLEADED I HAVE LED A HAPPY LIFE
IS NOT CUSTOMARY IN A LADY'S ROOM AND I THOUGHT HERBERT INTERRUPTED HIM AGAIN AND YOU THOUGHT YOUR INTERFERENCE MIGHT BE WELCOME TO THE LADY AM I RIGHT QUITE RIGHT
THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN WRONGED WHO HAD THE RIGHT TO JUDGE FOR HERSELF AND TO SPEAK FOR HERSELF WAS THE SILENT WOMAN OF THE TWO IT WAS NOT QUITE DARK YET SYDNEY COULD SEE AS WELL AS HEAR
MIGHT HAVE DECEIVED ME SHE HAS NOT DECEIVED ME I OWE IT TO HER TO REMEMBER THAT SHE SHALL GO BUT NOT HELPLESS AND NOT FRIENDLESS HER HUSBAND FORGOT THE RESTRAINTS HE HAD IMPOSED ON HIMSELF
AND HE ACCORDINGLY RETIRED ON SECOND THOUGHTS HOWEVER HE HAD RETURNED IN THE HOPE IN THE HOPE HERBERT INTERPOSED OF SEEING MISSUS PRESTY'S DAUGHTER THAT WAS ONE OF MY MOTIVES
WHICH WERE CONNECTED WITH THE HOTEL HE FOUND HIS ONE CONSOLATION IN VISITING THE SCENES WHICH REMINDED HIM OF THE BELOVED WOMAN WHOM HE HAD LOST THE REASON FOR THIS WAS NOT FAR TO SEEK HIS WAS THE LARGEST NATURE
AM I MAKING ANOTHER LUCKY GUESS IF I SUPPOSE MYSELF TO BE SPEAKING TO CAPTAIN BENNYDECK I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR SIR HOW YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY NAME
BY ATTEMPTING TO DEFEND HIMSELF WHILE SHE WAS INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING HIM YOU WILL BE SORRY WHEN YOU FIND THAT YOU HAVE MISJUDGED ME HE SAID AND SIGHED AND LEFT HER
BUT I AM AT A LOSS TO KNOW HOW IT INTERESTS YOU IN THAT CASE ALLOW ME TO ENLIGHTEN YOU MY NAME IS HERBERT LINLEY HE HAD HELD HIS NAME IN RESERVE
THERE WAS NO DISGUISING IT THE TWO WHO HAD ONCE BEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE WERE PARTED IRREVOCABLY BY THE WIFE'S OWN ACT LET HIM REPENT EVER SO SINCERELY LET HIM BE EVER SO READY TO RETURN
MISSUS PRESTY WAS ESTABLISHED IN HER OWN PROPER PERSON WITH HER DAUGHTER AND GRANDCHILD AT THE HOTEL LADY MYRIE YIELDED TO THE FORCE OF EVIDENCE SHE LIFTED HER HANDS IN HORROR
I TOLD HER WHO I WAS AH IT WAS A MELANCHOLY MEETING FOR BOTH OF US
SHE WAS NOT WELL THAT EVENING AND SHE BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED THIS IS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT MISSUS ROMSEY SAID TO HER HUSBAND YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN CHARMED WITH MISSUS NORMAN HIGHLY BRED
IT WAS TOO SAD I SAID I HAD KNOWN HER LODGINGS WELL MANY YEARS AGO
IN SILENCE MISSUS LINLEY RAISED HER TOOK THE WRITING WHICH TESTIFIED TO HER CHARACTER FROM THE TABLE AND PRESENTED IT LINLEY LOOKED AT HIS WIFE LOOKED AT THE GOVERNESS HE WAITED
AT THE MOMENT OF RECOGNITION THE TROUBLED MIND OF CATHERINE WAS INSTANTLY STEADIED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THAT COARSEST SENSE WHICH LEVELS US WITH THE ANIMALS THE SENSE OF ANGER
HER DESPAIR FORCED ITS WAY TO EXPRESSION IN WORDS I WISH I COULD FORGET YOU SHE ANSWERED IN RECKLESS WRETCHEDNESS THE CHILD WAS STILL TOO DROWSY TO HEAR PLAINLY
WHEN SHE HAD RETURNED THAT MORNING FROM HER WALK HE HAD BEEN KIND AND CONSIDERATE HE HAD LISTENED TO HER LITTLE STORY OF THE RELICS OF HER FATHER FOUND IN THE GARRET AS IF HER INTERESTS WERE HIS INTERESTS THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING TO DISAPPOINT HER NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF
THE SHOCK I HAVE SUFFERED THE MISERY THE HUMILIATION I TELL YOU IT'S MORE THAN I CAN BEAR STAY HERE BY YOURSELF IF YOU LIKE I MEAN TO GO
FOR INSTANCE THE WRITER GIVES REASONS FOR MAKING HIS STATEMENT VERY WELL EXPRESSED NO DOUBT BUT WE DON'T WANT REASONS THEN AGAIN HE OFFERS HIS OWN OPINION ON THE RIGHT COURSE TO TAKE
THE TOILET TABLE WAS CLOSE TO HER SHE LOOKED ABSENTLY AT HER HAGGARD FACE IN THE GLASS WHAT A LOST WRETCH SHE SAW THE GENEROUS IMPULSES WHICH OTHER WOMEN WERE FREE TO FEEL WERE FORBIDDEN LUXURIES TO HER
TO HER DISMAY HE REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND WORSE STILL HE NOTICED HER DAUGHTER'S ABSENCE AND ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY SERIOUS CAUSE FOR IT FOR THE MOMENT
MISSUS PRESTY PICKED IT UP FROM THE FLOOR DETERMINED BY THIS TIME TO HOLD IT
AND TO PUT HIS INQUIRIES UNDER ANOTHER FORM MIGHT HE ASK HIS WIFE IF ANYBODY HAD SEEN MISTER NORMAN NO OR HEARD OF HIM MISSUS ROMSEY ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE ONCE MORE
TO ARRIVE AT THIS CONCLUSION AND TO RECOMMEND A VISIT TO SANDYSEAL WERE EVENTS WHICH FOLLOWED EACH OTHER MEDICALLY SPEAKING AS A MATTER OF COURSE THE HEALTH OF THE CHILDREN
LET ME UNDERSTAND FIRST WHAT THE SACRIFICE MEANS DOES MISS WESTERFIELD MAKE ANY CONDITIONS
HAD BEEN THE HAPPIEST EVENT IN HER MARRIED LIFE BUT SHE UNDERSTOOD HER DUTY TO HERSELF AS A RESPECTABLE WOMAN I THINK MISTER ROMSEY YOU MIGHT HAVE SPARED THAT CRUEL ALLUSION
SHE ALLUDED AGAIN TO HERBERT LINLEY AND SHE SPOKE TOO SOON WILL YOU LET HIM ASK YOUR PARDON SHE SAID HE EXPECTS NO MORE
MEETING AS STRANGERS AND BUT TOO LIKELY TO DISCOVER EACH OTHER IN ALL HER EXPERIENCE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN PLACED IN SUCH A POSITION OF EMBARRASSMENT
SHE LOOKED AT HER FATHER AND MOTHER
HE ANSWERED SADLY SHE MAY ACCEPT YOUR MERCY I MAY NOT EVEN HOPE FOR IT SOMETHING IN THE TONE OF HIS VOICE REMINDED HER OF PAST DAYS
THAN HERSELF AND HER FUTURE LOOKING ABSENTLY ROUND THE ROOM SHE NOTICED THE PACKET OF HER FATHER'S LETTERS PLACED ON THE TABLE BY HER BEDSIDE THE FIRST THREE LETTERS THAT SHE EXAMINED
REMEMBERING NOTHING ELSE QUITE WELL AND HAPPY MISS THANK YOU SUSAN SAID
AT THE SAME MOMENT RANDAL SEIZED HIS FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING
WHILE HIS CLIENT'S PECUNIARY AFFAIRS WERE STILL UNSETTLED THE LAWYER HAD HIS CLAIM TO BE TAKEN INTO HER CONFIDENCE
BUT THE DEPTH OF WATER WAS SUITED TO SMALL VESSELS ONLY TO SHABBY OLD FISHING SMACKS WHICH SELDOM PAID THEIR EXPENSES AND TO DIRTY LITTLE COASTERS CARRYING COALS AND POTATOES
WOULD THE END HAVE BEEN BUT SHE HAD THUS FAR ESCAPED THE DANGER OF EXCITING HIS DISTRUST THAT SHE LOVED HIM HE KNEW
HE SAW HER CROSSING THE STREET ON HER WAY BACK TO HIM SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM WITH HER COMPLEXION HEIGHTENED BY EXERCISE SHE KISSED HIM AND SAID WITH HER PRETTY SMILE
WAITING FOR SYDNEY TO COME INTO THE BEDROOM AS USUAL AND WISH HER GOOD NIGHT KITTY WAS ASTONISHED BY THE APPEARANCE OF HER GRANDMOTHER ENTERING ON TIPTOE FROM THE CORRIDOR WITH A SMALL PAPER PARCEL IN HER HAND
SHE SAID IT WAS HALF AN HOUR PAST THE TIME
WHICH MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO HER IN AFTER LIFE WHEN YOU GROW UP TO BE A WOMAN MY DEAR BEWARE OF MAKING THE MISTAKE THAT I HAVE JUST COMMITTED NEVER BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MENTION YOUR REASONS WHEN A CHILD ASKS WHY
WILL THEY BE LONG DO YOU THINK BEFORE THEY COME SHE ASKED
TO MAKE A COMPLICATED STATEMENT IN FEW WORDS PERMIT ME TO SEIZE THE POINTS IN THE LATE MISTER PRESTY'S STYLE AND TO PUT THEM IN THE STRONGEST LIGHT THIS PLACE RANDAL IS ALWAYS FULL AND WE DIDN'T WRITE LONG ENOUGH BEFOREHAND TO SECURE ROOMS
SITUATED AT THE INNERMOST END OF A DULL LITTLE BAY SANDYSEAL SO FAR AS ANY VIEW OF THE SHIPPING IN THE CHANNEL WAS CONCERNED MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUILT ON A REMOTE ISLAND IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN
KEPT A MORSEL OF PAPER IN ITS PLACE ON WHICH SHE HAD WRITTEN A FEW PENITENT WORDS OF FAREWELL ADDRESSED TO MISSUS LINLEY
ONE OF THE WINDOWS WAS OPEN ALREADY SHE THREW UP THE OTHER TO GET MORE AIR IN THE COOLER ATMOSPHERE HER MEMORY RECOVERED ITSELF SHE RECOLLECTED THE NEWSPAPER THAT HERBERT HAD TAKEN FROM HER INSTANTLY SHE RANG FOR THE MAID
THE ONE BEST WAY OF TELLING SYDNEY HOW DEAR SHE WAS TO HIM ALREADY FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE WOULD BE TO ANSWER HER IN PERSON HE HURRIED AWAY TO LONDON BY THE FIRST TRAIN
INCAPABLE OF HEARING WHAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM MISSUS PRESTY COULD SEE THAT A SECRET UNDERSTANDING UNITED HER SON IN LAW AND THE GOVERNESS SHE LOOKED ROUND CAUTIOUSLY AT MISSUS LINLEY
THE SEASIDE MIGHT DO YOU GOOD DON'T YOU THINK SO I DARESAY MY DEAR WHERE SHALL WE GO OH I LEAVE THAT TO YOU NO SYDNEY IT WAS I WHO PROPOSED COMING TO LONDON
AS THE POSITION IN WHICH SHE FOUND HERSELF NOW THE SENSE OF HONOR WHICH HAD PROMPTED CATHERINE'S RESOLUTION TO MAKE BENNYDECK ACQUAINTED WITH THE CATASTROPHE OF MARRIED LIFE MIGHT PLEAD HER EXCUSE
RANDAL SAW THE CHILD'S LOOK OF BEWILDERMENT AND FELT FOR HER SHE MAY TALK AS SHE PLEASES TO ME HE SAID BUT NOT TO STRANGERS SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT I AM SURE
GAVE DISTRESSING PROPHECY OF FAILURE THE LADY WHO SAT NEXT HIM LOOKED ROUND AT THE DESERTED HOUSE ONCE OR TWICE AND THEN SAID WHAT A PITY THERE IS SUCH A POOR HOUSE TONIGHT IT'S SO HARD ON PEOPLE TO HAVE TO SING TO EMPTY BENCHES
AND BECAUSE HE FOUND ALL THE OTHER SUBURBS OF DUBLIN MEAN MODERN AND PRETENTIOUS HE LIVED IN AN OLD SOMBRE HOUSE AND FROM HIS WINDOWS HE COULD LOOK INTO THE DISUSED DISTILLERY OR UPWARDS ALONG THE SHALLOW RIVER ON WHICH DUBLIN IS BUILT
WHO WAS ONE OF MARY JANE'S PUPILS ASKED MISS DALY WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE PRETTY WALTZ SHE HAD PLAYED AND MISTER BROWNE SEEING THAT HE WAS IGNORED
THE LOFTY WALLS OF HIS UNCARPETED ROOM WERE FREE FROM PICTURES HE HAD HIMSELF BOUGHT EVERY ARTICLE OF FURNITURE IN THE ROOM A BLACK IRON BEDSTEAD AN IRON WASHSTAND FOUR CANE CHAIRS A CLOTHES RACK
WHO HAD SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AND WAS REPUTED TO OWN SOME OF THE BIGGEST HOTELS IN FRANCE SUCH A PERSON AS HIS FATHER AGREED WAS WELL WORTH KNOWING EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THE CHARMING COMPANION HE WAS
AND SHE BEGAN TO LOOK FOR HER PLUMCAKE SHE TRIED IN DOWNES'S BAG AND THEN IN THE POCKETS OF HER WATERPROOF AND THEN ON THE HALLSTAND BUT NOWHERE COULD SHE FIND IT THEN SHE ASKED ALL THE CHILDREN HAD ANY OF THEM EATEN IT BY MISTAKE OF COURSE
BUT OFTEN DISAPPOINTED HE LIVED AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM HIS BODY REGARDING HIS OWN ACTS WITH DOUBTFUL SIDE GLANCES HE HAD AN ODD AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL HABIT WHICH LED HIM TO COMPOSE IN HIS MIND FROM TIME TO TIME
HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD REGRET IN THE MORNING BUT AT PRESENT HE WAS GLAD OF THE REST GLAD OF THE DARK STUPOR THAT WOULD COVER UP HIS FOLLY HE LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND RESTED HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS HANDS COUNTING THE BEATS OF HIS TEMPLES
AND GALLANTLY THE MACHINERY OF HUMAN NERVES STROVE TO ANSWER THE BOUNDING COURSES OF THE SWIFT BLUE ANIMAL THEY DROVE DOWN DAME STREET THE STREET WAS BUSY WITH UNUSUAL TRAFFIC LOUD WITH THE HORNS OF MOTORISTS AND THE GONGS OF IMPATIENT TRAM DRIVERS
HE WAS VERY NICE WITH HER AND WHEN SHE WAS GETTING OUT AT THE CANAL BRIDGE SHE THANKED HIM AND BOWED AND HE BOWED TO HER AND RAISED HIS HAT AND SMILED AGREEABLY AND WHILE SHE WAS GOING UP ALONG THE TERRACE BENDING HER TINY HEAD UNDER THE RAIN
VILLONA WAS ENTERTAINING ALSO A BRILLIANT PIANIST BUT UNFORTUNATELY VERY POOR THE CAR RAN ON MERRILY WITH ITS CARGO OF HILARIOUS YOUTH THE TWO COUSINS SAT ON THE FRONT SEAT JIMMY AND HIS HUNGARIAN FRIEND SAT BEHIND
THESE WERE THE ONLY DISSIPATIONS OF HIS LIFE HE HAD NEITHER COMPANIONS NOR FRIENDS CHURCH NOR CREED HE LIVED HIS SPIRITUAL LIFE WITHOUT ANY COMMUNION WITH OTHERS VISITING HIS RELATIVES AT CHRISTMAS
RIVIERE NOT WHOLLY INGENUOUSLY UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN TO JIMMY THE TRIUMPH OF THE FRENCH MECHANICIANS THE RESONANT VOICE OF THE HUNGARIAN WAS ABOUT TO PREVAIL IN RIDICULE OF THE SPURIOUS LUTES OF THE ROMANTIC PAINTERS
MAMMA IS MAMMA BUT MARIA IS MY PROPER MOTHER AFTER THE BREAK UP AT HOME THE BOYS HAD GOT HER THAT POSITION IN THE DUBLIN BY LAMPLIGHT LAUNDRY AND SHE LIKED IT
THE HIGH COLOUR OF HIS CHEEKS PUSHED UPWARDS EVEN TO HIS FOREHEAD WHERE IT SCATTERED ITSELF IN A FEW FORMLESS PATCHES OF PALE RED AND ON HIS HAIRLESS FACE THERE SCINTILLATED RESTLESSLY THE POLISHED LENSES AND THE BRIGHT GILT RIMS OF THE GLASSES WHICH SCREENED HIS DELICATE AND RESTLESS EYES
HER HUSBAND'S GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD COME FROM LEGHORN HER HUSBAND WAS CAPTAIN OF A MERCANTILE BOAT PLYING BETWEEN DUBLIN AND HOLLAND AND THEY HAD ONE CHILD MEETING HER A THIRD TIME BY ACCIDENT HE FOUND COURAGE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
AND AT LAST CAME OUT OF THE SHOP LADEN WITH A BIG BAG THEN SHE THOUGHT WHAT ELSE WOULD SHE BUY SHE WANTED TO BUY SOMETHING REALLY NICE THEY WOULD BE SURE TO HAVE PLENTY OF APPLES AND NUTS
TELL ME LILY HE SAID IN A FRIENDLY TONE
AND IN AN IRONICAL MOMENT THE HEADLINE OF AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR BILE BEANS HAD BEEN PASTED ON TO THE FIRST SHEET ON LIFTING THE LID OF THE DESK A FAINT FRAGRANCE ESCAPED THE FRAGRANCE OF NEW CEDARWOOD PENCILS OR OF A BOTTLE OF GUM
EVERYBODY WHO KNEW THEM CAME TO IT MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY OLD FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY THE MEMBERS OF JULIA'S CHOIR ANY OF KATE'S PUPILS THAT WERE GROWN UP ENOUGH AND EVEN SOME OF MARY JANE'S PUPILS TOO NEVER ONCE HAD IT FALLEN FLAT
LIZZIE FLEMING SAID MARIA WAS SURE TO GET THE RING AND THOUGH FLEMING HAD SAID THAT FOR SO MANY HALLOW EVES MARIA HAD TO LAUGH AND SAY SHE DIDN'T WANT ANY RING OR MAN EITHER
HIS WHOLE SPEECH WAS A MISTAKE FROM FIRST TO LAST AN UTTER FAILURE JUST THEN HIS AUNTS AND HIS WIFE CAME OUT OF THE LADIES DRESSING ROOM HIS AUNTS WERE TWO SMALL PLAINLY DRESSED OLD WOMEN AUNT JULIA WAS AN INCH OR SO THE TALLER HER HAIR
TO A MUSIC OF MERRY BELLS
THERE WAS ONE THING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND THAT WAS THE TRACTS ON THE WALKS BUT THE MATRON WAS SUCH A NICE PERSON TO DEAL WITH SO GENTEEL WHEN THE COOK TOLD HER EVERYTHING WAS READY
WE BOTH HAVE A PAIR NOW GABRIEL SAYS EVERYONE WEARS THEM ON THE CONTINENT O ON THE CONTINENT MURMURED AUNT JULIA NODDING HER HEAD SLOWLY GABRIEL KNITTED HIS BROWS AND SAID AS IF HE WERE SLIGHTLY ANGERED IT'S NOTHING VERY WONDERFUL BUT
GAVE MUSIC LESSONS TO BEGINNERS ON THE OLD SQUARE PIANO IN THE BACK ROOM LILY THE CARETAKER'S DAUGHTER DID HOUSEMAID'S WORK FOR THEM THOUGH THEIR LIFE WAS MODEST THEY BELIEVED IN EATING WELL THE BEST OF EVERYTHING DIAMOND BONE SIRLOINS
ON THE SIDEBOARD WERE ARRAYED DISHES AND PLATES AND GLASSES AND BUNDLES OF KNIVES AND FORKS AND SPOONS THE TOP OF THE CLOSED SQUARE PIANO SERVED ALSO AS A SIDEBOARD FOR VIANDS AND SWEETS AT A SMALLER SIDEBOARD IN ONE CORNER
AND MISSUS DONNELLY SAID MARIA WOULD ENTER A CONVENT BEFORE THE YEAR WAS OUT BECAUSE SHE HAD GOT THE PRAYER BOOK MARIA HAD NEVER SEEN JOE SO NICE TO HER AS HE WAS THAT NIGHT SO FULL OF PLEASANT TALK AND REMINISCENCES
THEN AN IMPROMPTU SQUARE DANCE THE MEN DEVISING ORIGINAL FIGURES WHAT MERRIMENT JIMMY TOOK HIS PART WITH A WILL THIS WAS SEEING LIFE AT LEAST THEN FARLEY GOT OUT OF BREATH AND CRIED STOP
THE NEXT THING HE'LL BUY ME WILL BE A DIVING SUIT GABRIEL LAUGHED NERVOUSLY AND PATTED HIS TIE REASSURINGLY WHILE AUNT KATE NEARLY DOUBLED HERSELF SO HEARTILY DID SHE ENJOY THE JOKE THE SMILE SOON FADED FROM AUNT JULIA'S FACE AND HER MIRTHLESS EYES WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS HER NEPHEW'S FACE
AT THE CONTROL SEGOUIN HAD PRESENTED HIM TO ONE OF THE FRENCH COMPETITORS AND IN ANSWER TO HIS CONFUSED MURMUR OF COMPLIMENT THE SWARTHY FACE OF THE DRIVER HAD DISCLOSED A LINE OF SHINING WHITE TEETH
AND TO HAVE YOUR OWN MONEY IN YOUR POCKET SHE HOPED THEY WOULD HAVE A NICE EVENING SHE WAS SURE THEY WOULD BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING WHAT A PITY IT WAS ALPHY AND JOE WERE NOT SPEAKING
THEN HE TOOK A COIN RAPIDLY FROM HIS POCKET O LILY HE SAID THRUSTING IT INTO HER HANDS IT'S CHRISTMASTIME ISN'T IT JUST HERE'S A LITTLE HE WALKED RAPIDLY TOWARDS THE DOOR O NO SIR CRIED THE GIRL FOLLOWING HIM REALLY SIR I WOULDN'T TAKE IT
THEN GINGER MOONEY LIFTED HER MUG OF TEA AND PROPOSED MARIA'S HEALTH WHILE ALL THE OTHER WOMEN CLATTERED WITH THEIR MUGS ON THE TABLE AND SAID SHE WAS SORRY SHE HADN'T A SUP OF PORTER TO DRINK IT IN
THE TABLE WAS CLEARED VILLONA RETURNED QUIETLY TO HIS PIANO AND PLAYED VOLUNTARIES FOR THEM THE OTHER MEN PLAYED GAME AFTER GAME FLINGING THEMSELVES BOLDLY INTO THE ADVENTURE THEY DRANK THE HEALTH OF THE QUEEN OF HEARTS AND OF THE QUEEN OF DIAMONDS
RUBBING THE KNUCKLES OF HIS LEFT FIST BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS INTO HIS LEFT EYE GOOD EVENING FREDDY SAID AUNT JULIA FREDDY MALINS BADE THE MISSES MORKAN GOOD EVENING IN WHAT SEEMED AN OFFHAND FASHION BY REASON OF THE HABITUAL CATCH IN HIS VOICE AND THEN
DECIDEDLY VILLONA WAS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS HE KEPT UP A DEEP BASS HUM OF MELODY FOR MILES OF THE ROAD THE FRENCHMEN FLUNG THEIR LAUGHTER AND LIGHT WORDS OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AND OFTEN JIMMY HAD TO STRAIN FORWARD TO CATCH THE QUICK PHRASE
HE TOOK THE REMARK AS AN INVITATION TO TALK HE WAS SURPRISED THAT SHE SEEMED SO LITTLE AWKWARD WHILE THEY TALKED HE TRIED TO FIX HER PERMANENTLY IN HIS MEMORY WHEN HE LEARNED THAT THE YOUNG GIRL BESIDE HER WAS HER DAUGHTER
THEY WERE WALKING OUT OF KINGSTOWN STATION THE TICKET COLLECTOR SALUTED JIMMY HE WAS AN OLD MAN FINE NIGHT SIR IT WAS A SERENE SUMMER NIGHT THE HARBOUR LAY LIKE A DARKENED MIRROR AT THEIR FEET
A LITTLE HAND MIRROR HUNG ABOVE THE WASHSTAND AND DURING THE DAY A WHITE SHADED LAMP STOOD AS THE SOLE ORNAMENT OF THE MANTELPIECE THE BOOKS ON THE WHITE WOODEN SHELVES WERE ARRANGED FROM BELOW UPWARDS ACCORDING TO BULK
THEN JOE ASKED WOULD SHE TAKE A BOTTLE OF STOUT AND MISSUS DONNELLY SAID THERE WAS PORT WINE TOO IN THE HOUSE IF SHE WOULD PREFER THAT MARIA SAID SHE WOULD RATHER THEY DIDN'T ASK HER TO TAKE ANYTHING BUT JOE INSISTED
IT WAS PLEASANT AFTER THAT HONOUR TO RETURN TO THE PROFANE WORLD OF SPECTATORS AMID NUDGES AND SIGNIFICANT LOOKS THEN AS TO MONEY HE REALLY HAD A GREAT SUM UNDER HIS CONTROL
AND HIS MANNER EXPRESSED A REAL RESPECT FOR FOREIGN ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT THIS SUBTLETY OF HIS HOST WAS PROBABLY LOST UPON THE HUNGARIAN WHO WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE A SHARP DESIRE FOR HIS DINNER THE DINNER WAS EXCELLENT EXQUISITE
MANY OF HER PUPILS BELONGED TO THE BETTER CLASS FAMILIES ON THE KINGSTOWN AND DALKEY LINE OLD AS THEY WERE HER AUNTS ALSO DID THEIR SHARE JULIA THOUGH SHE WAS QUITE GREY WAS STILL THE LEADING SOPRANO IN ADAM AND EVE'S AND KATE BEING TOO FEEBLE TO GO ABOUT MUCH
AT THE SAME MOMENT A CLAPPING OF HANDS AND A FINAL FLOURISH OF THE PIANIST TOLD THAT THE WALTZ HAD ENDED THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR WAS OPENED FROM WITHIN AND SOME COUPLES CAME OUT AUNT KATE DREW GABRIEL ASIDE HURRIEDLY AND WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR
T J CONROY OF THE PORT AND DOCKS GRETTA TELLS ME YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE A CAB BACK TO MONKSTOWN TONIGHT GABRIEL SAID AUNT KATE NO SAID GABRIEL TURNING TO HIS WIFE WE HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF THAT LAST YEAR HADN'T WE
THE WOMEN WOULD HAVE THEIR TEA AT SIX O'CLOCK AND SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET AWAY BEFORE SEVEN FROM BALLSBRIDGE TO THE PILLAR TWENTY MINUTES FROM THE PILLAR TO DRUMCONDRA TWENTY MINUTES AND TWENTY MINUTES TO BUY THE THINGS
SHE WAS ALWAYS SENT FOR WHEN THE WOMEN QUARRELLED OVER THEIR TUBS AND ALWAYS SUCCEEDED IN MAKING PEACE ONE DAY THE MATRON HAD SAID TO HER MARIA YOU ARE A VERITABLE PEACE MAKER
MISS KATE AND MISS JULIA WERE THERE GOSSIPING AND LAUGHING AND FUSSING WALKING AFTER EACH OTHER TO THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS PEERING DOWN OVER THE BANISTERS AND CALLING DOWN TO LILY TO ASK HER WHO HAD COME IT WAS ALWAYS A GREAT AFFAIR THE MISSES MORKAN'S ANNUAL DANCE
THE TWO AUNTS LAUGHED HEARTILY TOO FOR GABRIEL'S SOLICITUDE WAS A STANDING JOKE WITH THEM GOLOSHES SAID MISSUS CONROY THAT'S THE LATEST WHENEVER IT'S WET UNDERFOOT I MUST PUT ON MY GALOSHES TONIGHT EVEN HE WANTED ME TO PUT THEM ON BUT I WOULDN'T
FREDDY MALINS LEFT HAND ACCEPTED THE GLASS MECHANICALLY HIS RIGHT HAND BEING ENGAGED IN THE MECHANICAL READJUSTMENT OF HIS DRESS
WHEN SEGOUIN SHEPHERDED HIS PARTY INTO POLITICS HERE WAS CONGENIAL GROUND FOR ALL JIMMY UNDER GENEROUS INFLUENCES FELT THE BURIED ZEAL OF HIS FATHER WAKE TO LIFE WITHIN HIM HE AROUSED THE TORPID ROUTH AT LAST
AND SHE LOOKED WITH QUAINT AFFECTION AT THE DIMINUTIVE BODY WHICH SHE HAD SO OFTEN ADORNED IN SPITE OF ITS YEARS SHE FOUND IT A NICE TIDY LITTLE BODY WHEN SHE GOT OUTSIDE THE STREETS WERE SHINING WITH RAIN
JULIA WHO WAS CARRYING IN A COLUMN OF TABLE NAPKINS
THE CARS CAME SCUDDING IN TOWARDS DUBLIN RUNNING EVENLY LIKE PELLETS IN THE GROOVE OF THE NAAS ROAD
AND A NEATLY GROOMED YOUNG MAN NAMED DOYLE SEGOUIN WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD UNEXPECTEDLY RECEIVED SOME ORDERS IN ADVANCE HE WAS ABOUT TO START A MOTOR ESTABLISHMENT IN PARIS
AND THIS TIME SHE GOT THE PRAYER BOOK AFTER THAT MISSUS DONNELLY PLAYED MISS MC CLOUD'S REEL FOR THE CHILDREN AND JOE MADE MARIA TAKE A GLASS OF WINE SOON THEY WERE ALL QUITE MERRY AGAIN
HIS FATHER WHO HAD BEGUN LIFE AS AN ADVANCED NATIONALIST HAD MODIFIED HIS VIEWS EARLY HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY AS A BUTCHER IN KINGSTOWN AND BY OPENING SHOPS IN DUBLIN AND IN THE SUBURBS HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY MANY TIMES OVER
THE MEN ROSE TO THEIR FEET TO PLAY THE LAST TRICKS TALKING AND GESTICULATING ROUTH WON THE CABIN SHOOK WITH THE YOUNG MEN'S CHEERING AND THE CARDS WERE BUNDLED TOGETHER THEY BEGAN THEN TO GATHER IN WHAT THEY HAD WON FARLEY AND JIMMY WERE THE HEAVIEST LOSERS
THAT HE DID NOT SUSPECT THAT ANYONE ELSE WOULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN HER AS THE HUSBAND WAS OFTEN AWAY AND THE DAUGHTER OUT GIVING MUSIC LESSONS MISTER DUFFY HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES OF ENJOYING THE LADY'S SOCIETY
TWO GENTLEMEN AND THREE LADIES MARY JANE O HERE'S MISTER BERGIN AND MISTER KERRIGAN SAID MARY JANE MISTER KERRIGAN WILL YOU TAKE MISS POWER MISS FURLONG MAY I GET YOU A PARTNER MISTER BERGIN O THAT'LL JUST DO NOW THREE LADIES MARY JANE
SHE FELT A SOFT WET SUBSTANCE WITH HER FINGERS AND WAS SURPRISED THAT NOBODY SPOKE OR TOOK OFF HER BANDAGE THERE WAS A PAUSE FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN A GREAT DEAL OF SCUFFLING AND WHISPERING
THE MUSIC THAT STILL VIBRATED IN THEIR EARS UNITED THEM THIS UNION EXALTED HIM WORE AWAY THE ROUGH EDGES OF HIS CHARACTER EMOTIONALISED HIS MENTAL LIFE SOMETIMES HE CAUGHT HIMSELF LISTENING TO THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE
HE ENTANGLED HIS THOUGHTS WITH HERS HE LENT HER BOOKS PROVIDED HER WITH IDEAS SHARED HIS INTELLECTUAL LIFE WITH HER SHE LISTENED TO ALL SOMETIMES IN RETURN FOR HIS THEORIES SHE GAVE OUT SOME FACT OF HER OWN LIFE
AS IF THE QUESTION HAD SURPRISED HER IT'S ONLY FREDDY KATE AND GABRIEL WITH HIM IN FACT RIGHT BEHIND HER GABRIEL COULD BE SEEN PILOTING FREDDY MALINS ACROSS THE LANDING THE LATTER A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FORTY WAS OF GABRIEL'S SIZE AND BUILD WITH VERY ROUND SHOULDERS
CAB WINDOWS RATTLING ALL THE WAY
THE FIRE WAS NICE AND BRIGHT AND ON ONE OF THE SIDE TABLES WERE FOUR VERY BIG BARMBRACKS THESE BARMBRACKS SEEMED UNCUT
IN FACT THESE FOUR YOUNG MEN WERE ALMOST HILARIOUS THEY WERE CHARLES SEGOUIN THE OWNER OF THE CAR ANDRE RIVIERE A YOUNG ELECTRICIAN OF CANADIAN BIRTH A HUGE HUNGARIAN NAMED VILLONA
AND THE SHUFFLING OF THEIR SOLES REMINDED HIM THAT THEIR GRADE OF CULTURE DIFFERED FROM HIS HE WOULD ONLY MAKE HIMSELF RIDICULOUS BY QUOTING POETRY TO THEM WHICH THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEY WOULD THINK THAT HE WAS AIRING HIS SUPERIOR EDUCATION
PARCELLED IT UP AND SAID TWO AND FOUR PLEASE SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE TO STAND IN THE DRUMCONDRA TRAM BECAUSE NONE OF THE YOUNG MEN SEEMED TO NOTICE HER BUT AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN MADE ROOM FOR HER
SO SHE WENT OVER TO A SHOP IN HENRY STREET HERE SHE WAS A LONG TIME IN SUITING HERSELF AND THE STYLISH YOUNG LADY BEHIND THE COUNTER WHO WAS EVIDENTLY A LITTLE ANNOYED BY HER
SWAYING THEIR BODIES TO AND FRO WITH NERVOUS JERKS OF THEIR SHOULDERS THE BOLDEST SAID O NOW MISTER BROWNE I'M SURE THE DOCTOR NEVER ORDERED ANYTHING OF THE KIND MISTER BROWNE TOOK ANOTHER SIP OF HIS WHISKY AND SAID WITH SIDLING MIMICRY WELL YOU SEE
HE CONTINUED SCRAPING HIS FEET VIGOROUSLY WHILE THE THREE WOMEN WENT UPSTAIRS LAUGHING TO THE LADIES DRESSING ROOM A LIGHT FRINGE OF SNOW LAY LIKE A CAPE ON THE SHOULDERS OF HIS OVERCOAT
AND BESIDES HE WAS AN OPTIMIST BY NATURE THE FOURTH MEMBER OF THE PARTY HOWEVER WAS TOO EXCITED TO BE GENUINELY HAPPY HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE WITH A SOFT LIGHT BROWN MOUSTACHE AND RATHER INNOCENT LOOKING GREY EYES
MARY JANE WHO WAS THEN A LITTLE GIRL IN SHORT CLOTHES WAS NOW THE MAIN PROP OF THE HOUSEHOLD FOR SHE HAD THE ORGAN IN HADDINGTON ROAD SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH THE ACADEMY AND GAVE A PUPILS CONCERT EVERY YEAR IN THE UPPER ROOM OF THE ANTIENT CONCERT ROOMS
AND AS HE STOOD IN THE HALL GIVING A LAST EQUATION TO THE BOWS OF HIS DRESS TIE HIS FATHER MAY HAVE FELT EVEN COMMERCIALLY SATISFIED AT HAVING SECURED FOR HIS SON QUALITIES OFTEN UNPURCHASEABLE HIS FATHER THEREFORE WAS UNUSUALLY FRIENDLY WITH VILLONA
AND MISSUS DONNELLY SAID IT WAS TOO GOOD OF HER TO BRING SUCH A BIG BAG OF CAKES AND MADE ALL THE CHILDREN SAY THANKS MARIA BUT MARIA SAID SHE HAD BROUGHT SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR PAPA AND MAMMA SOMETHING THEY WOULD BE SURE TO LIKE
THE GIRL SEEING THAT HE HAD GAINED THE STAIRS CALLED OUT AFTER HIM WELL THANK YOU SIR HE WAITED OUTSIDE THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR UNTIL THE WALTZ SHOULD FINISH LISTENING TO THE SKIRTS THAT SWEPT AGAINST IT AND TO THE SHUFFLING OF FEET
AND AS THE BUTTONS OF HIS OVERCOAT SLIPPED WITH A SQUEAKING NOISE THROUGH THE SNOW STIFFENED FRIEZE A COLD FRAGRANT AIR FROM OUT OF DOORS ESCAPED FROM CREVICES AND FOLDS IS IT SNOWING AGAIN MISTER CONROY ASKED LILY
THE CABIN DOOR OPENED AND HE SAW THE HUNGARIAN STANDING IN A SHAFT OF GREY LIGHT
VILLONA SAYING HEAR HEAR WHENEVER THERE WAS A PAUSE THERE WAS A GREAT CLAPPING OF HANDS WHEN HE SAT DOWN IT MUST HAVE BEEN A GOOD SPEECH FARLEY CLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK AND LAUGHED LOUDLY WHAT JOVIAL FELLOWS WHAT GOOD COMPANY THEY WERE CARDS CARDS
BUT AS THESE CIRCUMSTANCES NEVER AROSE HIS LIFE ROLLED OUT EVENLY AN ADVENTURELESS TALE ONE EVENING HE FOUND HIMSELF SITTING BESIDE TWO LADIES IN THE ROTUNDA THE HOUSE THINLY PEOPLED AND SILENT
SHE HAD THE NOTIONS OF A COMMON WOMAN BUT WASN'T MARIA GLAD WHEN THE WOMEN HAD FINISHED THEIR TEA AND THE COOK AND THE DUMMY HAD BEGUN TO CLEAR AWAY THE TEA THINGS
A RED FACED YOUNG WOMAN DRESSED IN PANSY CAME INTO THE ROOM EXCITEDLY CLAPPING HER HANDS AND CRYING
OF COURSE YOU'VE SEEN ABOUT THE ROOM GRETTA WAS SAYING O THE ROOM IS ALL RIGHT REPLIED GABRIEL I'VE TAKEN ONE IN THE GRESHAM TO BE SURE SAID AUNT KATE BY FAR THE BEST THING TO DO AND THE CHILDREN GRETTA YOU'RE NOT ANXIOUS ABOUT THEM
AND MARIA LAUGHED AGAIN TILL THE TIP OF HER NOSE NEARLY MET THE TIP OF HER CHIN AND TILL HER MINUTE BODY NEARLY SHOOK ITSELF ASUNDER BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT MOONEY MEANT WELL THOUGH OF COURSE
THEY HAD GOOD REASON TO BE FUSSY ON SUCH A NIGHT AND THEN IT WAS LONG AFTER TEN O'CLOCK AND YET THERE WAS NO SIGN OF GABRIEL AND HIS WIFE BESIDES THEY WERE DREADFULLY AFRAID THAT FREDDY MALINS MIGHT TURN UP SCREWED THEY WOULD NOT WISH FOR WORLDS THAT ANY OF MARY JANE'S PUPILS SHOULD SEE HIM UNDER THE INFLUENCE
ASKED HER WAS IT WEDDING CAKE SHE WANTED TO BUY THAT MADE MARIA BLUSH AND SMILE AT THE YOUNG LADY BUT THE YOUNG LADY TOOK IT ALL VERY SERIOUSLY AND FINALLY CUT A THICK SLICE OF PLUMCAKE
THAT GABRIEL IS HERE I ALWAYS FEEL EASIER IN MY MIND WHEN HE'S HERE JULIA THERE'S MISS DALY AND MISS POWER WILL TAKE SOME REFRESHMENT THANKS FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL WALTZ MISS DALY IT MADE LOVELY TIME
NOW MARY GRIMES IF I DON'T TAKE IT MAKE ME TAKE IT FOR I FEEL I WANT IT HIS HOT FACE HAD LEANED FORWARD A LITTLE TOO CONFIDENTIALLY AND HE HAD ASSUMED A VERY LOW DUBLIN ACCENT SO THAT THE YOUNG LADIES WITH ONE INSTINCT RECEIVED HIS SPEECH IN SILENCE MISS FURLONG
O BUT YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT HE MAKES ME WEAR NOW SHE BROKE OUT INTO A PEAL OF LAUGHTER AND GLANCED AT HER HUSBAND WHOSE ADMIRING AND HAPPY EYES HAD BEEN WANDERING FROM HER DRESS TO HER FACE AND HAIR
HIS FACE WHICH CARRIED THE ENTIRE TALE OF HIS YEARS WAS OF THE BROWN TINT OF DUBLIN STREETS ON HIS LONG AND RATHER LARGE HEAD GREW DRY BLACK HAIR AND A TAWNY MOUSTACHE DID NOT QUITE COVER AN UNAMIABLE MOUTH
THAT FEARING ANOTHER COLLAPSE ON HER PART HE BADE HER GOOD BYE QUICKLY AND LEFT HER A FEW DAYS LATER HE RECEIVED A PARCEL CONTAINING HIS BOOKS AND MUSIC FOUR YEARS PASSED MISTER DUFFY RETURNED TO HIS EVEN WAY OF LIFE
JIMMY SET OUT TO TRANSLATE INTO DAYS WORK THAT LORDLY CAR IN WHICH HE SAT HOW SMOOTHLY IT RAN IN WHAT STYLE THEY HAD COME CAREERING ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS THE JOURNEY LAID A MAGICAL FINGER ON THE GENUINE PULSE OF LIFE
THEIR GAZE BEGAN WITH A DEFIANT NOTE BUT WAS CONFUSED BY WHAT SEEMED A DELIBERATE SWOON OF THE PUPIL INTO THE IRIS REVEALING FOR AN INSTANT A TEMPERAMENT OF GREAT SENSIBILITY THE PUPIL REASSERTED ITSELF QUICKLY
HIS CHEEKBONES ALSO GAVE HIS FACE A HARSH CHARACTER BUT THERE WAS NO HARSHNESS IN THE EYES WHICH LOOKING AT THE WORLD FROM UNDER THEIR TAWNY EYEBROWS GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF A MAN EVER ALERT TO GREET A REDEEMING INSTINCT IN OTHERS
THEN HE ASKED ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN TO MOVE ASIDE AND TAKING HOLD OF THE DECANTER FILLED OUT FOR HIMSELF A GOODLY MEASURE OF WHISKY THE YOUNG MEN EYED HIM RESPECTFULLY WHILE HE TOOK A TRIAL SIP GOD HELP ME HE SAID SMILING IT'S THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS
SHE SAID THEY WERE ALL VERY GOOD TO HER AT LAST THE CHILDREN GREW TIRED AND SLEEPY AND JOE ASKED MARIA WOULD SHE NOT SING SOME LITTLE SONG BEFORE SHE WENT ONE OF THE OLD SONGS
EACH BLUE CAR THEREFORE RECEIVED A DOUBLE MEASURE OF WELCOME AS IT TOPPED THE CREST OF THE HILL AND EACH CHEER OF WELCOME WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH SMILES AND NODS BY THOSE IN THE CAR IN ONE OF THESE TRIMLY BUILT CARS WAS A PARTY OF FOUR YOUNG MEN WHOSE SPIRITS SEEMED TO BE AT PRESENT
IT WAS A TERRIBLE GAME THEY STOPPED JUST BEFORE THE END OF IT TO DRINK FOR LUCK JIMMY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GAME LAY BETWEEN ROUTH AND SEGOUIN WHAT EXCITEMENT JIMMY WAS EXCITED TOO HE WOULD LOSE OF COURSE HOW MUCH HAD HE WRITTEN AWAY
WITH ALMOST MATERNAL SOLICITUDE SHE URGED HIM TO LET HIS NATURE OPEN TO THE FULL SHE BECAME HIS CONFESSOR HE TOLD HER THAT FOR SOME TIME HE HAD ASSISTED AT THE MEETINGS OF AN IRISH SOCIALIST PARTY
HE SUPPOSED THE BAG WAS FULL OF GOOD THINGS FOR THE LITTLE ONES AND SAID IT WAS ONLY RIGHT THAT THE YOUNGSTERS SHOULD ENJOY THEMSELVES WHILE THEY WERE YOUNG MARIA AGREED WITH HIM AND FAVOURED HIM WITH DEMURE NODS AND HEMS
BUT I'VE A NICE PARTNER FOR YOU MISTER BARTELL D'ARCY THE TENOR I'LL GET HIM TO SING LATER ON ALL DUBLIN IS RAVING ABOUT HIM
WHAT A COMFORT IT IS TO HAVE A GIRL LIKE THAT ONE YOU CAN DEPEND ON THERE'S THAT LILY I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS COME OVER HER LATELY SHE'S NOT THE GIRL SHE WAS AT ALL GABRIEL WAS ABOUT TO ASK HIS AUNT SOME QUESTIONS ON THIS POINT BUT SHE BROKE OFF SUDDENLY TO GAZE AFTER HER SISTER WHO HAD WANDERED DOWN THE STAIRS AND
AS LONG AS ANYONE COULD REMEMBER EVER SINCE KATE AND JULIA AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR BROTHER PAT HAD LEFT THE HOUSE IN STONEY BATTER AND TAKEN MARY JANE THEIR ONLY NIECE TO LIVE WITH THEM IN THE DARK GAUNT HOUSE ON USHER'S ISLAND THE UPPER PART OF WHICH THEY HAD RENTED FROM MISTER FULHAM THE CORN FACTOR ON THE GROUND FLOOR
CAREERING HOMEWARD AND THROUGH THIS CHANNEL OF POVERTY AND INACTION THE CONTINENT SPED ITS WEALTH AND INDUSTRY NOW AND AGAIN THE CLUMPS OF PEOPLE RAISED THE CHEER OF THE GRATEFULLY OPPRESSED THEIR SYMPATHY HOWEVER WAS FOR THE BLUE CARS
SHE CAME THIS WAS THE FIRST OF MANY MEETINGS THEY MET ALWAYS IN THE EVENING AND CHOSE THE MOST QUIET QUARTERS FOR THEIR WALKS TOGETHER MISTER DUFFY HOWEVER HAD A DISTASTE FOR UNDERHAND WAYS
MARIA DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY JOE LAUGHED SO MUCH OVER THE ANSWER HE HAD MADE BUT SHE SAID THAT THE MANAGER MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY OVERBEARING PERSON TO DEAL WITH JOE SAID HE WASN'T SO BAD WHEN YOU KNEW HOW TO TAKE HIM
WERE TO GO HOME TO DRESS THE CAR STEERED OUT SLOWLY FOR GRAFTON STREET WHILE THE TWO YOUNG MEN PUSHED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE KNOT OF GAZERS THEY WALKED NORTHWARD WITH A CURIOUS FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE EXERCISE WHILE THE CITY HUNG ITS PALE GLOBES OF LIGHT ABOVE THEM
AND SHE WAS GLAD OF HER OLD BROWN WATERPROOF THE TRAM WAS FULL AND SHE HAD TO SIT ON THE LITTLE STOOL AT THE END OF THE CAR FACING ALL THE PEOPLE WITH HER TOES BARELY TOUCHING THE FLOOR
HIS FATHER REMONSTRATIVE BUT COVERTLY PROUD OF THE EXCESS HAD PAID HIS BILLS AND BROUGHT HIM HOME
HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO TIME LIKE THE LONG AGO AND NO MUSIC FOR HIM LIKE POOR OLD BALFE WHATEVER OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT SAY
AND SEIZED THE MOMENTS WHEN HER DAUGHTER'S ATTENTION WAS DIVERTED TO BECOME INTIMATE SHE ALLUDED ONCE OR TWICE TO HER HUSBAND BUT HER TONE WAS NOT SUCH AS TO MAKE THE ALLUSION A WARNING HER NAME WAS MISSUS SINICO
THEN SHE HAD HER PLANTS IN THE CONSERVATORY AND SHE LIKED LOOKING AFTER THEM SHE HAD LOVELY FERNS AND WAX PLANTS AND WHENEVER ANYONE CAME TO VISIT HER SHE ALWAYS GAVE THE VISITOR ONE OR TWO SLIPS FROM HER CONSERVATORY
THAT NIGHT THE CITY WORE THE MASK OF A CAPITAL THE FIVE YOUNG MEN STROLLED ALONG STEPHEN'S GREEN IN A FAINT CLOUD OF AROMATIC SMOKE THEY TALKED LOUDLY AND GAILY AND THEIR CLOAKS DANGLED FROM THEIR SHOULDERS THE PEOPLE MADE WAY FOR THEM
HE STOOD ON THE MAT SCRAPING THE SNOW FROM HIS GOLOSHES WHILE LILY LED HIS WIFE TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS AND CALLED OUT MISS KATE HERE'S MISSUS CONROY KATE AND JULIA CAME TODDLING DOWN THE DARK STAIRS AT ONCE
AND FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE MUST BE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE HE KEPT AWAY FROM CONCERTS LEST HE SHOULD MEET HER
IT WAS HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO BUY AND ALL SHE COULD THINK OF WAS CAKE
MISSUS CONROY LAUGHED DON'T MIND HIM AUNT KATE SHE SAID HE'S REALLY AN AWFUL BOTHER WHAT WITH GREEN SHADES FOR TOM'S EYES AT NIGHT AND MAKING HIM DO THE DUMB BELLS AND FORCING EVA TO EAT THE STIRABOUT THE POOR CHILD AND SHE SIMPLY HATES THE SIGHT OF IT
WAS CRANING HER NECK OVER THE BANISTERS NOW I ASK YOU SHE SAID ALMOST TESTILY WHERE IS JULIA GOING JULIA JULIA WHERE ARE YOU GOING JULIA WHO HAD GONE HALF WAY DOWN ONE FLIGHT CAME BACK AND ANNOUNCED BLANDLY HERE'S FREDDY
AND RIVIERE WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE WAS TO BE APPOINTED MANAGER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT THESE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE COUSINS WERE ALSO IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE FRENCH CARS VILLONA WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD HAD A VERY SATISFACTORY LUNCHEON
HIS FACE WAS FLESHY AND PALLID TOUCHED WITH COLOUR ONLY AT THE THICK HANGING LOBES OF HIS EARS AND AT THE WIDE WINGS OF HIS NOSE HE HAD COARSE FEATURES A BLUNT NOSE A CONVEX AND RECEDING BROW TUMID AND PROTRUDED LIPS
A TORRENT OF TALK FOLLOWED FARLEY WAS AN AMERICAN NO ONE KNEW VERY WELL WHAT THE TALK WAS ABOUT VILLONA AND RIVIERE WERE THE NOISIEST BUT ALL THE MEN WERE EXCITED THEY GOT UP ON A CAR SQUEEZING THEMSELVES TOGETHER AMID MUCH LAUGHTER
HE HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARS CASHIER OF A PRIVATE BANK IN BAGGOT STREET EVERY MORNING HE CAME IN FROM CHAPELIZOD BY TRAM AT MIDDAY HE WENT TO DAN BURKE'S AND TOOK HIS LUNCH A BOTTLE OF LAGER BEER AND A SMALL TRAYFUL OF ARROWROOT BISCUITS
THE TWO YOUNG GENTLEMEN ASKED THE LADIES IF THEY MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE AND MARY JANE TURNED TO MISS DALY O MISS DALY YOU'RE REALLY AWFULLY GOOD AFTER PLAYING FOR THE LAST TWO DANCES BUT REALLY WE'RE SO SHORT OF LADIES TONIGHT I DON'T MIND IN THE LEAST MISS MORKAN
TO COMPETE WITH PHRASEMONGERS INCAPABLE OF THINKING CONSECUTIVELY FOR SIXTY SECONDS TO SUBMIT HIMSELF TO THE CRITICISMS OF AN OBTUSE MIDDLE CLASS WHICH ENTRUSTED ITS MORALITY TO POLICEMEN AND ITS FINE ARTS TO IMPRESARIOS
SHE USED TO HAVE SUCH A BAD OPINION OF PROTESTANTS BUT NOW SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE VERY NICE PEOPLE A LITTLE QUIET AND SERIOUS BUT STILL VERY NICE PEOPLE TO LIVE WITH
AS HE DID NOT WISH THEIR LAST INTERVIEW TO BE TROUBLED BY THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR RUINED CONFESSIONAL THEY MET IN A LITTLE CAKESHOP NEAR THE PARKGATE IT WAS COLD AUTUMN WEATHER BUT IN SPITE OF THE COLD THEY WANDERED UP AND DOWN THE ROADS OF THE PARK FOR NEARLY THREE HOURS
AND THE SUB MATRON AND TWO OF THE BOARD LADIES HAD HEARD THE COMPLIMENT AND GINGER MOONEY WAS ALWAYS SAYING WHAT SHE WOULDN'T DO TO THE DUMMY WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE IRONS IF IT WASN'T FOR MARIA EVERYONE WAS SO FOND OF MARIA
JIMMY FELT OBSCURELY THE LACK OF AN AUDIENCE THE WIT WAS FLASHING PLAY RAN VERY HIGH AND PAPER BEGAN TO PASS JIMMY DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHO WAS WINNING BUT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS LOSING BUT IT WAS HIS OWN FAULT FOR HE FREQUENTLY MISTOOK HIS CARDS
A TALL WIZEN FACED MAN WITH A STIFF GRIZZLED MOUSTACHE AND SWARTHY SKIN WHO WAS PASSING OUT WITH HIS PARTNER SAID AND MAY WE HAVE SOME REFRESHMENT TOO MISS MORKAN
THE GIRL GLANCED BACK AT HIM OVER HER SHOULDER AND SAID WITH GREAT BITTERNESS
ONE GOT THE PRAYER BOOK AND THE OTHER THREE GOT THE WATER AND WHEN ONE OF THE NEXT DOOR GIRLS GOT THE RING MISSUS DONNELLY SHOOK HER FINGER AT THE BLUSHING GIRL AS MUCH AS TO SAY O I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
AND ESCORTING THEM TO THE CEMETERY WHEN THEY DIED HE PERFORMED THESE TWO SOCIAL DUTIES FOR OLD DIGNITY'S SAKE BUT CONCEDED NOTHING FURTHER TO THE CONVENTIONS WHICH REGULATE THE CIVIC LIFE
AND PULLING DOWN THE SLEEVES OF THEIR BLOUSES OVER THEIR RED STEAMING ARMS THEY SETTLED DOWN BEFORE THEIR HUGE MUGS WHICH THE COOK AND THE DUMMY FILLED UP WITH HOT TEA ALREADY MIXED WITH MILK AND SUGAR IN HUGE TIN CANS
THE CARS OF THEIR FRIENDS THE FRENCH THE FRENCH MOREOVER WERE VIRTUAL VICTORS THEIR TEAM HAD FINISHED SOLIDLY THEY HAD BEEN PLACED SECOND AND THIRD AND THE DRIVER OF THE WINNING GERMAN CAR WAS REPORTED A BELGIAN
SEGOUIN JIMMY DECIDED HAD A VERY REFINED TASTE THE PARTY WAS INCREASED BY A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN NAMED ROUTH WHOM JIMMY HAD SEEN WITH SEGOUIN AT CAMBRIDGE THE YOUNG MEN SUPPED IN A SNUG ROOM LIT BY ELECTRIC CANDLE LAMPS
O NO SIR SHE ANSWERED I'M DONE SCHOOLING THIS YEAR AND MORE O THEN SAID GABRIEL GAILY
THE WORKMEN'S DISCUSSIONS HE SAID WERE TOO TIMOROUS THE INTEREST THEY TOOK IN THE QUESTION OF WAGES WAS INORDINATE HE FELT THAT THEY WERE HARD FEATURED REALISTS AND THAT THEY RESENTED AN EXACTITUDE WHICH WAS THE PRODUCE OF A LEISURE NOT WITHIN THEIR REACH
HE WAS STILL DISCOMPOSED BY THE GIRL'S BITTER AND SUDDEN RETORT IT HAD CAST A GLOOM OVER HIM WHICH HE TRIED TO DISPEL BY ARRANGING HIS CUFFS AND THE BOWS OF HIS TIE HE THEN TOOK FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET A LITTLE PAPER AND GLANCED AT THE HEADINGS HE HAD MADE FOR HIS SPEECH
BUT JIMMY WHO IN SPITE OF TEMPORARY ERRORS WAS AT HEART THE INHERITOR OF SOLID INSTINCTS KNEW WELL WITH WHAT DIFFICULTY IT HAD BEEN GOT TOGETHER THIS KNOWLEDGE HAD PREVIOUSLY KEPT HIS BILLS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF REASONABLE RECKLESSNESS
VERY JOLLY IT WAS GRETTA CAUGHT A DREADFUL COLD AUNT KATE FROWNED SEVERELY AND NODDED HER HEAD AT EVERY WORD QUITE RIGHT GABRIEL QUITE RIGHT SHE SAID YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL BUT AS FOR GRETTA THERE SAID GABRIEL SHE'D WALK HOME IN THE SNOW IF SHE WERE LET
THIS HALF DISCLOSED NATURE FELL AGAIN UNDER THE REIGN OF PRUDENCE AND HER ASTRAKHAN JACKET MOULDING A BOSOM OF A CERTAIN FULLNESS STRUCK THE NOTE OF DEFIANCE MORE DEFINITELY HE MET HER AGAIN A FEW WEEKS AFTERWARDS AT A CONCERT IN EARLSFORT TERRACE
JIMMY HAD A RESPECT FOR HIS FATHER'S SHREWDNESS IN BUSINESS MATTERS AND IN THIS CASE IT HAD BEEN HIS FATHER WHO HAD FIRST SUGGESTED THE INVESTMENT MONEY TO BE MADE IN THE MOTOR BUSINESS POTS OF MONEY MOREOVER SEGOUIN HAD THE UNMISTAKABLE AIR OF WEALTH
HE WAS UNDECIDED ABOUT THE LINES FROM ROBERT BROWNING FOR HE FEARED THEY WOULD BE ABOVE THE HEADS OF HIS HEARERS SOME QUOTATION THAT THEY WOULD RECOGNISE FROM SHAKESPEARE OR FROM THE MELODIES WOULD BE BETTER THE INDELICATE CLACKING OF THE MEN'S HEELS
AND IF HE HAD BEEN SO CONSCIOUS OF THE LABOUR LATENT IN MONEY WHEN THERE HAD BEEN QUESTION MERELY OF SOME FREAK OF THE HIGHER INTELLIGENCE HOW MUCH MORE SO NOW WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO STAKE THE GREATER PART OF HIS SUBSTANCE IT WAS A SERIOUS THING FOR HIM
FREDDY MALINS WHO WAS NEARING THE CLIMAX OF HIS STORY WAVED THE OFFER ASIDE IMPATIENTLY BUT MISTER BROWNE HAVING FIRST CALLED FREDDY MALINS ATTENTION TO A DISARRAY IN HIS DRESS FILLED OUT AND HANDED HIM A FULL GLASS OF LEMONADE
MARIA SUPERINTENDED THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BARMBRACK AND SAW THAT EVERY WOMAN GOT HER FOUR SLICES THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF LAUGHING AND JOKING DURING THE MEAL
HE ADMIRED THE DEXTERITY WITH WHICH THEIR HOST DIRECTED THE CONVERSATION THE FIVE YOUNG MEN HAD VARIOUS TASTES AND THEIR TONGUES HAD BEEN LOOSENED VILLONA WITH IMMENSE RESPECT BEGAN TO DISCOVER TO THE MILDLY SURPRISED ENGLISHMAN THE BEAUTIES OF THE ENGLISH MADRIGAL
HE DID NOT FINISH HIS SENTENCE BUT SEEING THAT AUNT KATE WAS OUT OF EARSHOT AT ONCE LED THE THREE YOUNG LADIES INTO THE BACK ROOM THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WAS OCCUPIED BY TWO SQUARE TABLES PLACED END TO END AND ON THESE AUNT JULIA AND THE CARETAKER WERE STRAIGHTENING AND SMOOTHING A LARGE CLOTH
MISSUS DONNELLY SAID DO PLEASE MARIA AND SO MARIA HAD TO GET UP AND STAND BESIDE THE PIANO MISSUS DONNELLY BADE THE CHILDREN BE QUIET AND LISTEN TO MARIA'S SONG THEN SHE PLAYED THE PRELUDE AND SAID NOW MARIA
GRETTA THINKS IT VERY FUNNY BECAUSE SHE SAYS THE WORD REMINDS HER OF CHRISTY MINSTRELS
SAID LILY TO GABRIEL WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM MISS KATE AND MISS JULIA THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING GOOD NIGHT MISSUS CONROY I'LL ENGAGE THEY DID SAID GABRIEL BUT THEY FORGET THAT MY WIFE HERE TAKES THREE MORTAL HOURS TO DRESS HERSELF
SHE THOUGHT HOW EASY IT WAS TO KNOW A GENTLEMAN EVEN WHEN HE HAS A DROP TAKEN EVERYBODY SAID O HERE'S MARIA WHEN SHE CAME TO JOE'S HOUSE
O NO HARDLY NOTICEABLE NOW ISN'T HE A TERRIBLE FELLOW SHE SAID AND HIS POOR MOTHER MADE HIM TAKE THE PLEDGE ON NEW YEAR'S EVE
THAT HE WAS A DECENT SORT SO LONG AS YOU DIDN'T RUB HIM THE WRONG WAY MISSUS DONNELLY PLAYED THE PIANO FOR THE CHILDREN AND THEY DANCED AND SANG THEN THE TWO NEXT DOOR GIRLS HANDED ROUND THE NUTS
AND HERE'S MISTER BROWNE AND MISS FURLONG TAKE THEM IN JULIA WITH MISS DALY AND MISS POWER I'M THE MAN FOR THE LADIES SAID MISTER BROWNE PURSING HIS LIPS UNTIL HIS MOUSTACHE BRISTLED AND SMILING IN ALL HIS WRINKLES YOU KNOW MISS MORKAN THE REASON THEY ARE SO FOND OF ME IS
HE WAS A STOUT GENTLEMAN AND HE WORE A BROWN HARD HAT HE HAD A SQUARE RED FACE AND A GREYISH MOUSTACHE
BEFORE LEAVING THE ROOM WITH GABRIEL SHE SIGNALLED TO MISTER BROWNE BY FROWNING AND SHAKING HER FOREFINGER IN WARNING TO AND FRO MISTER BROWNE NODDED IN ANSWER AND WHEN SHE HAD GONE SAID TO FREDDY MALINS NOW THEN TEDDY
HE WROTE SELDOM IN THE SHEAF OF PAPERS WHICH LAY IN HIS DESK ONE OF HIS SENTENCES WRITTEN TWO MONTHS AFTER HIS LAST INTERVIEW WITH MISSUS SINICO READ LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE MUST NOT BE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE
THEY LED HER UP TO THE TABLE AMID LAUGHING AND JOKING AND SHE PUT HER HAND OUT IN THE AIR AS SHE WAS TOLD TO DO SHE MOVED HER HAND ABOUT HERE AND THERE IN THE AIR AND DESCENDED ON ONE OF THE SAUCERS
THEY TALKED VOLUBLY AND WITH LITTLE RESERVE JIMMY WHOSE IMAGINATION WAS KINDLING CONCEIVED THE LIVELY YOUTH OF THE FRENCHMEN TWINED ELEGANTLY UPON THE FIRM FRAMEWORK OF THE ENGLISHMAN'S MANNER A GRACEFUL IMAGE OF HIS HE THOUGHT AND A JUST ONE
WHERE HE HAD FELT HIMSELF A UNIQUE FIGURE AMIDST A SCORE OF SOBER WORKMEN IN A GARRET LIT BY AN INEFFICIENT OIL LAMP WHEN THE PARTY HAD DIVIDED INTO THREE SECTIONS EACH UNDER ITS OWN LEADER AND IN ITS OWN GARRET HE HAD DISCONTINUED HIS ATTENDANCES
AND GLANCED AT HER SHE WAS A SLIM GROWING GIRL PALE IN COMPLEXION AND WITH HAY COLOURED HAIR THE GAS IN THE PANTRY MADE HER LOOK STILL PALER GABRIEL HAD KNOWN HER WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD AND USED TO SIT ON THE LOWEST STEP NURSING A RAG DOLL YES LILY HE ANSWERED
SHE WENT INTO THE WOMEN'S ROOM AND BEGAN TO PULL THE BIG BELL IN A FEW MINUTES THE WOMEN BEGAN TO COME IN BY TWOS AND THREES WIPING THEIR STEAMING HANDS IN THEIR PETTICOATS
AT FOUR O'CLOCK HE WAS SET FREE HE DINED IN AN EATING HOUSE IN GEORGE'S STREET WHERE HE FELT HIMSELF SAFE FROM THE SOCIETY OF DUBLIN'S GILDED YOUTH AND WHERE THERE WAS A CERTAIN PLAIN HONESTY IN THE BILL OF FARE
A COAL SCUTTLE A FENDER AND IRONS AND A SQUARE TABLE ON WHICH LAY A DOUBLE DESK A BOOKCASE HAD BEEN MADE IN AN ALCOVE BY MEANS OF SHELVES OF WHITE WOOD THE BED WAS CLOTHED WITH WHITE BEDCLOTHES AND A BLACK AND SCARLET RUG COVERED THE FOOT
HE WENT OFTEN TO HER LITTLE COTTAGE OUTSIDE DUBLIN OFTEN THEY SPENT THEIR EVENINGS ALONE LITTLE BY LITTLE AS THEIR THOUGHTS ENTANGLED THEY SPOKE OF SUBJECTS LESS REMOTE
HE HAD ALSO BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SECURE SOME OF THE POLICE CONTRACTS AND IN THE END HE HAD BECOME RICH ENOUGH TO BE ALLUDED TO IN THE DUBLIN NEWSPAPERS AS A MERCHANT PRINCE HE HAD SENT HIS SON TO ENGLAND TO BE EDUCATED IN A BIG CATHOLIC COLLEGE
WERE WE ALL OF MY STAMP MEN KNOWN TO BE UTTERLY HOSTILE TO HANNO AND HIS PARTY SUSPICION WOULD FALL UPON OUR MEETINGS AT ONCE BUT HERE WE ARE AS HE SPOKE HE DREW ASIDE SOME HEAVY CURTAINS
AS A READINESS TO PAY AN EXORBITANT PRICE MIGHT HAVE GIVEN RISE TO DOUBTS IN THE CAPTAIN'S MIND AS TO THE QUALITY OF HIS PASSENGERS ONCE OR TWICE HE MADE AS IF HE WOULD GO ASHORE AND THE CAPTAIN AT LAST ABATED HIS DEMANDS TO A REASONABLE SUM WHEN THIS WAS SETTLED
THOSE OF GREECE AND ROME ARE NOT SO BLOODTHIRSTY AND YET MARS GIVES AS MANY VICTORIES TO THE ROMAN ARMS AS MOLOCH DOES TO OURS BLASPHEME NOT THE GODS MALCHUS GISCON SAID GLOOMILY
OR TO LAUNCH THEIR TRIREMES TO ENGAGE THE FLEETS OF ROME THE SEVERE CHECKS WHICH THEY HAD LATELY SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE NEWLY FORMED ROMAN NAVY AND THE CERTAINTY THAT ERE LONG A TREMENDOUS STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS MUST TAKE PLACE
BUT THROUGH THE LONG PERIODS OF ENFORCED IDLENESS IN THEIR WINTER QUARTERS FROM FIRST TO LAST THROUGH THE LONG WAR THERE WAS NEITHER GRUMBLING NOR DISCONTENT NOR INSUBORDINATION AMONG THE TROOPS THEY SERVED WILLINGLY AND CHEERFULLY
SO THESE YOUNG ARISTOCRATS OF CARTHAGE SMILED AND JESTED THOUGH WELL AWARE THAT THEY WERE RISKING THEIR LIVES NO DECISION WAS ARRIVED AT FOR THIS COULD ONLY BE DECIDED UPON AT A SPECIAL MEETING
AND ON IT ARE SPREAD FOUR COUCHES ON WHICH IN A POSITION HALF SITTING HALF RECLINING REPOSE THE PRINCIPAL PERSONAGES OF THE PARTY
THEY WERE PART OF THE CONTINGENT WHICH THEIR STATE WAS BOUND TO FURNISH TO CARTHAGE AND WENT UNWILLINGLY CURSING IN THEIR HEARTS THE POWER WHICH TORE THEM FROM THEIR HOMES TO FIGHT IN A WAR IN WHICH THEY HAD NEITHER CONCERN NOR INTEREST
AND THAT HE WAS IN FACT BUT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF HIS FAMILY IN THE DESIGN FOR OVERTHROWING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC FORTUNATELY FOR MALCHUS A FEW DAYS LATER ORDERS WERE GIVEN FOR THE INSTANT EMBARKATION
THE HORSES STANDING NEAR SUFFER MORE THE LATHER STANDS ON THEIR SIDES THEIR FLANKS HEAVE AND FROM TIME TO TIME THEY STRETCH OUT THEIR EXTENDED NOSTRILS IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH WHEN THE SUN SINKS A LITTLE LOWER
THE COMMAND OF THE SEA MUST BE REGAINED AND FRESH LEVIES OF TROOPS MADE TO ASK CARTHAGE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES IN HER PRESENT MOOD IS HOPELESS WE MUST AWAIT AN OPPORTUNITY I AND MY FRIENDS WILL PREPARE THE WAY
AT A LITTLE FREQUENTED LANDING STAGE A BOAT WAS AWAITING THEM AND THEY WERE AT ONCE ROWED TO THE SHIP WHICH WAS LYING AT ANCHOR HALF A MILE FROM THE SHORE IN READINESS FOR AN EARLY START IN THE MORNING ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN TRACED
ASKING QUESTIONS OF THE CAPTAINS OF THE SHIPS AS TO THEIR STORE OF PROVISIONS AND WATER RECEIVING FROM THE OFFICERS CHARGED WITH THAT DUTY THE LISTS OF THE WAR MACHINES AND STORES WHICH WERE STORED AWAY IN THE HULLS
VARRO WISHED TO MARCH AGAINST THE ENEMY WITHOUT DELAY WHILE EMILIUS WAS ADVERSE TO RISKING AN ENGAGEMENT IN A COUNTRY WHICH BEING LEVEL AND OPEN WAS FAVOURABLE TO THE ACTION OF HANNIBAL'S SUPERIOR CAVALRY
WOULD IN SHEER DESPAIR HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DECLARE FOR CARTHAGE
MALCHUS THE SON OF HAMILCAR THE LEADER OF THE EXPEDITION IN THE DESERT HAD BEEN FROM HIS EARLY CHILDHOOD TRAINED BY HIS FATHER IN THE USE OF ARMS WHEN HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD HAMILCAR HAD TAKEN HIM WITH HIM ON A CAMPAIGN IN SPAIN
WHERE NOTHING WAS LEFT UNDONE WHICH COULD ADD TO THE COMFORT AND CONTENTMENT OF THE TROOPS THERE IS NO STRONGER EVIDENCE OF THE POPULARITY OF HANNIBAL AND OF THE INFLUENCE WHICH HE EXERCISED OVER HIS TROOPS THAN THE FACT THAT THE ARMY UNDER HIM
TO FEEL ANY LIVELY INTEREST IN THE GLORIES OF THE REPUBLIC SO THAT THEY EAT AND DRINK SUFFICIENTLY AND CAN EARN THEIR LIVING IT MATTERS NOT VERY GREATLY TO THEM WHETHER CARTHAGE IS GREAT AND GLORIOUS OR HUMBLED AND DEFEATED BUT THIS WILL NOT ALWAYS BE SO
READY THOUGHTFUL AND TRUSTWORTHY HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY AND HATES HER TYRANTS I CAN GUARANTEE THAT HE WILL DO NOTHING IMPRUDENT BUT CAN BE TRUSTED AS ONE OF OURSELVES BEING YOUNG
BURYING HIS KNIFE BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS WITHOUT A SOUND THE MAN FELL FORWARD ON HIS FACE NESSUS COOLLY WIPED HIS KNIFE UPON THE GARMENTS OF THE SPY AND THEN PROCEEDED AT A RAPID PACE UNTIL HE OVERTOOK MALCHUS IT WAS A SPY HE SAID
THE WHOLE SPACE BELOW WAS OCCUPIED BY CARGO OR HORSES THE TROOPS LIVED AND SLEPT ON DECK HERE ON WIDE FLAT STONES THEY COOKED THEIR MEALS WHILED AWAY THE DAY BY GAMES OF CHANCE
THE BREEZE WILL BEGIN TO BLOW THE OCCUPANTS OF THE GROVE ARE MEN OF VARIED RACES AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO ATTEMPT AT MILITARY ORDER IT IS CLEAR AT ONCE THAT THEY ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTIES ONE
ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER LEAVING THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF GERONIUM THE ROMANS ENCAMPED AT A DISTANCE OF SIX MILES FROM THE CARTHAGINIANS HERE THE USUAL DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AT ONCE AROSE BETWEEN THE ROMAN CONSULS WHO COMMANDED THE ARMY ON ALTERNATE DAYS
CLIMBED OUT OF THE HOWDAH AND SLIPPED DOWN BY THE ELEPHANT'S TAIL THE USUAL PLAN FOR DISMOUNTING WHEN AN ELEPHANT IS ON ITS FEET
WAS UNWEARIED IN PROMOTING THEIR COMFORT AND WELL BEING AT ALL OTHER TIMES AS THE SPRING ADVANCED THE GREAT MAGAZINES WHICH HANNIBAL HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM BECAME NEARLY EXHAUSTED AND NO PROVISIONS COULD BE OBTAINED FROM THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY
BUT CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH FURTHER STRENGTHENING HIS CAMPS HANNIBAL SEEING THAT THE ROMANS WOULD NOT FIGHT DETACHED HIS NUMIDIAN CAVALRY ACROSS THE RIVER TO CUT OFF THE ROMAN FORAGING PARTIES AND TO SURROUND AND HARASS THEIR SMALLER CAMP ON THAT SIDE OF THE RIVER
FROM WHICH HANGS A POUCH OF THE SAME MATERIAL
BUT REMAINED ON BOARD UNTIL THE VESSEL SAILED AS HE FEARED THAT HE MIGHT AGAIN BE RECOGNIZED BY SOME OF THE SAILORS OF THE CARTHAGINIAN VESSELS IN PORT THE WEATHER WAS FAIR AND THE WIND LIGHT AND ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER SAILING
AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF THAT EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER HE GAVE THE SIGNAL TO HIS TRUMPETER WHO AGAIN BLEW A LONG AND PIERCING BLAST THE WORK OF EMBARKATION AT ONCE COMMENCED
THERE WERE SEVERAL VESSELS THERE FROM ITALIAN PORTS BUT BEFORE PROCEEDING TO ARRANGE FOR A PASSAGE MALCHUS WENT TO A SHOP AND BOUGHT FOR HIMSELF AND NESSUS SUCH CLOTHING AND ARMS AS WOULD ENABLE THEM TO PASS WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
AND YET HE FELT THAT BENEATH ALL THIS LEVITY HIS COMPANIONS WERE PERFECTLY IN EARNEST IN THEIR PLANS
FROM ONE OF THE POLES OF THE TENT HANG HIS ARMS A SHORT HEAVY SWORD WITH A HANDLE OF SOLID GOLD IN A SCABBARD INCRUSTED WITH THE SAME METAL AND A BALDRICK COVERED WITH PLATES OF GOLD BEAUTIFULLY WORKED AND LINED WITH THE SOFTEST LEATHER
SLOWLY RETRACED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE CITADEL A MINUTE OR TWO LATER MALCHUS ISSUED OUT AND QUIETLY FOLLOWED IT HE HAD GONE SOME DISTANCE WHEN HE SAW AN ARAB APPROACHING HIM AND SOON RECOGNIZED NESSUS
RECEIVED HIM MOST WARMLY AND LISTENED IN ASTONISHMENT TO HIS STORY OF WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM MALCHUS THEN EXPLAINED THE MISSION WITH WHICH HANNIBAL HAD CHARGED HIM AND ASKED HIS ADVICE AS TO THE BEST COURSE TO BE ADOPTED MANON WAS SILENT FOR A TIME
WHILE ANOTHER PRAETOR LUCIUS POSTUMIUS WITH ONE LEGION WAS IN CISALPINE GAUL KEEPING DOWN THE TRIBES FRIENDLY TO CARTHAGE BUT BEFORE THE NEW CONSULS ARRIVED TO TAKE THE COMMAND OF THE ARMY HANNIBAL HAD MOVED FROM GERONIUM
OF COMMANDING FIGURE AND FEATURES WHICH EXPRESS ENERGY AND RESOLUTION HIS BODY IS BARE TO THE WAIST SAVE FOR A LIGHT SHORT SLEEVED TUNIC OF THE FINEST MUSLIN EMBROIDERED ROUND THE NECK AND SLEEVES WITH GOLD
THEREFORE NO HARM CAN YET HAVE BEEN DONE STRIKE MY NAME OFF THE LIST AND FORGET THAT I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU YOU HAVE MY OATH THAT I WILL SAY NOUGHT OF ANYTHING THAT I HAVE HEARD YOU CAN WELL MAKE SOME EXCUSE TO YOUR COMRADES
THEIR ARMS ARE THROWN ASIDE THE GREATER PORTION OF THEIR CLOTHING HAS BEEN DISPENSED WITH SOME LIE STRETCHED ON THE GROUND IN SLUMBER THEIR FACES PROTECTED FROM ANY CHANCE RAYS WHICH MAY FIND THEIR WAY THROUGH THE FOLIAGE ABOVE
BUT THE COLOURS ARE GAYER THE FOURTH MEMBER OF THE PARTY IS A LAD OF SOME FIFTEEN YEARS OLD HIS FIGURE WHICH IS NAKED TO THE WAIST IS OF A PURE GRECIAN MODEL THE MUSCLES SHOWING UP CLEARLY BENEATH THE SKIN
IT IS ONLY BECAUSE YOU ARE ON HORSEBACK THAT I HAVE COME ROUND TO THIS GATE HAD YOU COME ON FOOT WE SHOULD HAVE ENTERED BY THE FRONT FORTUNATELY THERE ARE AMONG US MANY WHO ARE DEEMED TO BE MERE PLEASURE SEEKERS MEN WHO WAGER FORTUNES ON THEIR HORSES
ONE WHOM ALL OF YOU KNOW BY REPUTE IF NOT PERSONALLY IT IS MALCHUS THE SON OF GENERAL HAMILCAR HE IS YOUNG TO BE ENGAGED IN A BUSINESS LIKE OURS BUT I HAVE BEEN WITH HIM IN A CAMPAIGN AND CAN ANSWER FOR HIM HE IS BRAVE
FIGHTING WITH EXTREME OBSTINACY THE CARTHAGINIAN CENTRE WAS FORCED GRADUALLY BACK UNTIL THEY WERE AGAIN IN A LINE WITH THE AFRICANS ON THEIR FLANKS THE ROMANS HAD INSENSIBLY PRESSED IN FROM BOTH FLANKS UPON THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD MET WITH RESISTANCE
HE WILL HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING LESS LIKELY TO BE WATCHED AND MAY BE DOUBLY USEFUL HE IS READY TO TAKE THE OATH OF OUR SOCIETY AS GISCON WAS THE LEADING SPIRIT OF THE BAND HIS RECOMMENDATION WAS TAKEN AS AMPLY SUFFICIENT
BEFORE ANY ALARM CAN BE GIVEN ANOTHER THIRTY AT LEAST SHOULD BE SLAIN BEFORE THE TOWN IS FAIRLY AROUSED MAYBE EACH SECTION CAN UNDERTAKE THREE IF OUR PLANS ARE WELL LAID AND EACH CHOOSES FOR ATTACK THREE LIVING NEAR EACH OTHER
ARE SANDALS THEY ARE THE LIGHT ARMED NUMIDIAN HORSE NEAR THEM
EIGHT THOUSAND STRONG WHILE THE TWO THOUSAND NUMIDIANS WERE POSTED BETWEEN THE INFANTRY AND THE RIVER ON THE RIGHT FLANK HANNIBAL COMMANDED THE CENTRE OF THE ARMY IN PERSON HANNO THE RIGHT WING HASDRUBAL THE LEFT WING MAHARBAL COMMANDED THE CAVALRY
LISTENING TO EVERY SOUND AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE ANCHOR WAS WEIGHED THE SAILS HOISTED AND THE VESSEL BEGAN TO DRAW AWAY FROM CARTHAGE THAT HE WENT INTO HIS CABIN ON THE SIXTH DAY AFTER LEAVING CARTHAGE THE SHIP ENTERED THE PORT OF CORINTH
A ROMAN COOK CAPTURED IN A SEA FIGHT IN WHICH HIS MASTER A WEALTHY TRIBUNE WAS KILLED IS WATCHING THREE GREEKS WHO ARE UNDER HIS SUPERINTENDENCE PREPARING A REPAST
THEY HAD ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR GENERAL AND WERE WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THE MOST TREMENDOUS LABOURS AND TO ENGAGE IN THE MOST ARDUOUS CONFLICTS TO PLEASE HIM KNOWING THAT HE ON HIS PART
AT WHICH ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY WOULD BE PRESENT AMONG THOSE NOW IN COUNCIL OPINIONS WERE NEARLY EQUALLY DIVIDED THE ONE PARTY URGED THAT DID THEY TAKE STEPS TO PREPARE THE POPULACE FOR A RISING
FOR WEEKS AFTERWARDS I SCARCELY SLEPT DAY AND NIGHT THERE WAS BEFORE ME THAT TERRIBLE BRAZEN IMAGE OF MOLOCH
YOUR RESTLESSNESS IS ENOUGH TO GIVE ONE THE FEVER
IN WHICH THE ODDS AGAINST THEM WERE OVERWHELMING AND GREAT EVEN GISCON GENERALLY GRAVE AND GLOOMY WAS AS LIGHT HEARTED AS THE REST THE ARISTOCRACY OF CARTHAGE WERE
FOR CARTHAGE WITH ITS HIDEOUS TYRANNY ITS FOUL CORRUPTION ITS FORGETFULNESS OF ITS GLORY ITS HONOUR AND EVEN ITS SAFETY IS UTTERLY HATEFUL TO ME I TRUST THAT NEVER AGAIN SHALL I SET FOOT WITHIN ITS WALLS
YES IT WERE BETTER SO GISCON SAID AFTER A PAUSE I DARE NOT CONTINUE THE ENTERPRISE WITH ONE WHO CONDEMNS THE GODS AMONG US IT WOULD BE TO COURT FAILURE I DID NOT DREAM OF THIS
THEIR ARMS ARE SPEARS AND BATTLEAXES THEY ARE THE HEAVY INFANTRY OF CARTHAGE VERY VARIOUS IS THEIR NATIONALITY FAIR SKINNED GREEKS LIE SIDE BY SIDE WITH SWARTHY NEGROES FROM NUBIA
I AM NEITHER A CONDEMNER NOR A SPURNER MALCHUS SAID INDIGNANTLY I SAY ONLY THAT I BELIEVE YOU WORSHIP THEM WRONGFULLY THAT YOU DO THEM INJUSTICE I SAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE GODS WHO RULE THE WORLD
AND ACROSS THIS HANNIBAL HAD DRAWN UP HIS ARMY WITH BOTH WINGS RESTING UPON THE RIVER THUS THE ROMANS COULD NOT OUTFLANK HIM AND THE EFFECT OF THEIR VASTLY SUPERIOR NUMBERS IN INFANTRY WOULD TO SOME EXTENT BE NEUTRALIZED
LEAPED INTO A GARDEN AND HID HIMSELF AMONG SOME BUSHES THE MAHOUT NOW TURNED THE ELEPHANT AND
HE EXCLAIMED NOW IS THE TIME
IT BEHOOVES US TO USE EVERY EFFORT TO MAKE OURSELVES WORTHY OF OUR POSITION SET BEFORE YOURSELF THE EXAMPLE OF YOUR COUSIN HANNIBAL WHO YOUNG AS HE IS IS ALREADY VIEWED AS THE GREATEST MAN IN CARTHAGE
AS ONE WHO THOUGHT ONLY OF HORSE RACING SAID DO YOU SWEAR BY MOLOCH AND ASTARTE TO BE TRUE TO THIS SOCIETY TO DEVOTE YOURSELF TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OPPRESSORS OF CARTHAGE TO CARRY OUT ALL MEASURES WHICH MAY BE DETERMINED UPON
OF THE SEVENTY THOUSAND INFANTRY WHICH HAD ADVANCED TO THE FIGHT FORTY THOUSAND HAD FALLEN ON THE FIELD THREE THOUSAND WERE TAKEN PRISONERS SEVEN THOUSAND ESCAPED TO THE SMALL CAMP AND TEN THOUSAND MADE THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER TO THE LARGE CAMP
SWEPT ROUND BEHIND THEIR INFANTRY AND FELL UPON THE REAR OF THE ITALIAN HORSE WHILE THE NUMIDIANS CHARGED THEM FIERCELY IN FRONT THUS CAUGHT IN A TRAP THE ITALIAN HORSE WERE COMPLETELY ANNIHILATED AND SO BEFORE THE HEAVY INFANTRY OF THE TWO ARMIES MET EACH OTHER
THEY HAD UNDER THEM EIGHT FULL LEGIONS OR EIGHTY THOUSAND INFANTRY AND SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED CAVALRY TO OPPOSE THESE HANNIBAL HAD FORTY THOUSAND INFANTRY AND TEN THOUSAND EXCELLENT CAVALRY OF WHOM TWO THOUSAND WERE NUMIDIANS
BY WHICH IT IS SUSPENDED OVER HIS SHOULDER TWO OF HIS COMPANIONS ARE YOUNG MEN OF THREE OR FOUR AND TWENTY BOTH FAIR LIKE HIMSELF WITH FEATURES OF ALMOST GREEK REGULARITY OF OUTLINE THEIR DRESS IS SIMILAR TO HIS IN FASHION
CARTHALON SAID CARELESSLY THAT THE PUNISHMENT OF THE VIOLATION OF THE OATH IS DEATH IT IS SO PUT IN OUR RULES BUT WE ARE ALL NOBLES OF CARTHAGE AND NOBLES DO NOT BREAK THEIR OATHS SO WE CAN LET THAT PASS
THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH THE NEWS OF ANOTHER GREAT VICTORY WOULD AFFORD I WILL WRITE AT ONCE TO HANNIBAL AND EXPLAIN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SITUATION AND WILL TELL HIM WHY I HAVE COUNSELLED YOU TO AVOID CARRYING OUT HIS INSTRUCTIONS
COMPOSED AS IT WAS OF MEN OF SO MANY NATIONALITIES FOR THE MOST PART ORIGINALLY COMPELLED AGAINST THEIR WILL TO ENTER THE SERVICE OF CARTHAGE MAINTAINED THEIR DISCIPLINE UNSHAKEN NOT ONLY BY THE HARDSHIPS AND SACRIFICES OF THE CAMPAIGNS
TO RAISE A SECTION AMONG THE FISHERMEN THE SONS OF THE MAN JUST MURDERED SHOULD FORM A NUCLEUS WE AGREED FROM THE FIRST THAT THREE HUNDRED RESOLUTE MEN BESIDES OURSELVES WERE REQUIRED AND THAT EACH OF US SHOULD RAISE A SECTION OF TEN
AND AVOIDING THE BUSY STREETS OF THE TOWN DIRECTED ITS COURSE TOWARDS THE MORE QUIET ROADS OF THE OPULENT QUARTER OF MEGARA THE CRIES OF THE PEOPLE AT THE APPROACH OF THE ELEPHANT PRECEDED ITS COURSE AND ALL TOOK REFUGE IN GARDENS OR HOUSES
WHILE HANNIBAL COULD VICTUAL HIS ARMY FROM THE COUNTRY BEHIND HIM THE SENATE THEREFORE HAVING LARGELY REINFORCED THE ARMY ORDERED THE CONSULS TO ADVANCE AND GIVE BATTLE
MANON SAID FOR THE YOUNG BLOOD RUNS HOTLY IN YOUR VEINS AND YOUR RAGE AT SEEING THE FATE WHICH IS TOO CERTAINLY IMPENDING OVER CARTHAGE AND WHICH YOU ARE POWERLESS TO PREVENT IS IN NO WAY TO BE BLAMED
THEY TURNED OFF TOGETHER FROM THE MAIN ROAD
WHERE IF THE LIFE IS ROUGH IT IS AT LEAST FREE AND INDEPENDENT WHERE COURAGE AND MANLINESS AND HONOUR COUNT FOR MUCH AND WHERE THE ENERVATING INFLUENCE OF WEALTH IS AS YET UNKNOWN SUCH IS MY FIRM RESOLUTION
AND THANKING MANON FOR HIS KINDNESS HE RETURNED WITH NESSUS WHO HAD BEEN WAITING WITHOUT AS THEY WALKED ALONG MALCHUS BRIEFLY RELATED TO HIS FOLLOWER THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS INTERVIEW WITH MANON SUDDENLY NESSUS STOPPED AND LISTENED AND THEN RESUMED HIS WALK
WOULD BE THE HEIGHT OF MADNESS THE AFFAIRS OF STATE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY THE MAKING OF THE LAWS MUST BE SOLELY IN THE HANDS OF THOSE FITTED FOR THE TASK OF THE MEN WHO BY EDUCATION BY BIRTH BY POSITION
BY LITTLE SHELTERS COMPOSED OF THEIR CLOTHING HUNG ON TWO BOWS OR JAVELINS SOME LATELY AWAKENED ARE SITTING UP OR LEANING AGAINST THE TRUNKS OF THE TREES BUT SCARCE
AT THE SAME TIME HE LAUNCHED HIS HEAVY CAVALRY AGAINST THE ROMAN HORSE THE LATTER WERE INSTANTLY OVERTHROWN AND WERE DRIVEN FROM THE FIELD WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER EMILIUS HIMSELF WAS WOUNDED BUT MANAGED TO JOIN THE INFANTRY
THESE ACTS ARE SPREADING TERROR AMONG THE WORKING CLASSES AND UNLESS THEY ARE PUT A STOP TO WE CAN NO LONGER EXPECT ASSISTANCE FROM THEM THAT THESE DEEDS ARE THE WORK OF THE OFFICIALS OF THE TRIBUNALS WE HAVE NO DOUBT THE SOONER WE STRIKE THE BETTER
AND I DOUBT NOT THAT HE HAS HIS SPIES AMONG MY SLAVES AND SERVANTS
ARE DYED A COLOUR WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY A DEEP PURPLE BUT WHICH HAS FADED UNDER THE HEAT OF THE SUN TO LILAC THEY ARE A COMPANY OF IBERIAN SLINGERS ENLISTED AMONG THE TRIBES CONQUERED IN SPAIN BY THE CARTHAGINIANS
WHILE THE CARTHAGINIAN HEAVY HORSE WERE THUS DEFEATING THE ROMAN CAVALRY THE NUMIDIANS MANEUVERED NEAR THE GREATLY SUPERIOR CAVALRY OF THE ITALIAN ALLIES AND KEPT THEM OCCUPIED UNTIL THE HEAVY HORSE AFTER DESTROYING THE ROMAN CAVALRY
SOME THREW THEMSELVES ON THEIR FACES OTHERS GOT OVER THE PARAPET AND HUNG BY THEIR HANDS UNTIL HE HAD PASSED WHILE SOME SQUEEZED THEMSELVES AGAINST THE WALL BUT THE ELEPHANT PASSED ON WITHOUT DOING HARM TO ANY
HE HAD LEARNED TO ENDURE COLD AND HARDSHIPS IN THE DEPTH OF WINTER HIS FATHER HAD MADE HIM PASS THE NIGHTS UNCOVERED AND ALMOST WITHOUT CLOTHING IN THE COLD HE HAD BATHED IN THE ICY WATER OF THE TORRENTS FROM THE SNOW CLAD HILLS
THEY NEGLECTED TO PLACE A SUFFICIENT GUARD OVER THEIR GREAT MAGAZINES AT CANNAE TO DEFEND THEM FOR EVEN A FEW DAYS AGAINST A SUDDEN ATTACK HANNIBAL SAW THE OPPORTUNITY AND WHEN SPRING WAS PASSING INTO SUMMER
WOULD BE LIKELY TO MOVE THEIR WHOLE ARMY ACROSS AND TO GIVE BATTLE THIS IN FACT VARRO PROCEEDED TO DO LEAVING TEN THOUSAND MEN IN HIS OWN CAMP WITH ORDERS TO MARCH OUT AND ATTACK THAT OF HANNIBAL DURING THE ENGAGEMENT HE LED THE REST OF HIS TROOPS OVER THE RIVER
THE JUDGES SHOULD BE IMPARTIAL AND INCORRUPTIBLE EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS RIGHTS AND HIS PRIVILEGES THEN EACH MAN FEELING AN INTEREST IN THE STABILITY OF THE STATE WOULD BE READY TO BEAR ARMS IN ITS DEFENCE
AT LAST THE DAY FOR EMBARKATION ARRIVED AND THE TROOPS DEFILED THROUGH THE TEMPLE OF MOLOCH WHERE SACRIFICES WERE OFFERED UP FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE MALCHUS UNDER THE PRETENSE THAT SOMETHING WAS NOT READY AT THE LAST MOMENT LINGERED AT HOME
IF THE MAN BEHIND US BE HONEST HE WILL GO STRAIGHT ON IF HE BE A SPY HE WILL HESITATE AND STOP AT THE CORNER TO DECIDE WHICH OF US HE SHALL FOLLOW THEN I SHALL KNOW WHAT TO DO
I WILL COME DOWN AND SEE HIM HIS VISITS WERE THEY KNOWN WOULD EXCITE SUSPICION BID HIM ON HIS RETURN WATCH CLOSELY TO SEE THAT HE IS NOT FOLLOWED AND TELL HIM TO GO BY DEVIOUS WINDINGS AND TO MIX IN THE THICKEST CROWDS
HALF OF THESE WERE STORED AWAY IN THE HOLD OF THE GENERAL'S SHIP
IN ORDER TO THROW ANY ONE WHO MAY BE FOLLOWING OFF HIS TRACK BEFORE HE REJOINS YOU I TRUST TO BE ABLE TO ARRANGE FOR A SHIP IN THE COURSE OF THREE OR FOUR DAYS COME AGAIN AND SEE ME BEFORE YOU LEAVE HERE IS A BAG OF GOLD YOU WILL NEED IT TO REWARD THOSE WHO HAVE ASSISTED IN YOUR ESCAPE
IN REPLY TO THESE ARGUMENTS THE OTHER PARTY URGED THAT DELAYS WERE ALWAYS DANGEROUS THAT HUGE REWARDS WOULD BE OFFERED AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPTS THAT SOME OF THE MEN OF THE SECTIONS MIGHT TURN TRAITORS
WILL SET OUR AGENTS TO WORK AMONG THE PEOPLE AND WHEN THE NEWS OF ANOTHER VICTORY ARRIVES AND THE PEOPLE'S HOPES ARE AROUSED AND EXCITED WE WILL STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT AND CALL UPON THEM TO MAKE ONE GREAT EFFORT TO BRING THE STRUGGLE TO A CONCLUSION AND TO FINISH WITH ROME FOREVER
AND ENTERED A LARGE ROOM SOME TEN OR TWELVE YOUNG MEN WERE ASSEMBLED THERE THEY LOOKED UP IN SURPRISE AS GISCON ENTERED FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANION I HAVE BROUGHT A RECRUIT GISCON SAID
PAID A FAREWELL VISIT TO MANON AND REPEATED TO HIM ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS OF HANNIBAL AND MANON HANDED HIM HIS LETTER FOR THE GENERAL AND AGAIN ASSURED HIM THAT HE WOULD WITH HIS FRIENDS AT ONCE SET TO WORK TO PAVE THE WAY FOR AN APPEAL TO THE POPULACE AT THE FIRST FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY
AND HANNO AND HIS PARTY HAVE LAVISHED MONEY SO FREELY AMONG THE LOWER CLASSES THAT THERE IS NO HOPE OF STIRRING THE POPULACE UP TO DECLARE AGAINST HIM I THINK IT WOULD BE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE DANGEROUS WERE WE AS YOU PROPOSE
THIS BODY ALL COMPOSED OF YOUNG MEN OF THE BEST FAMILIES OF CARTHAGE
THEY ARE LITHE AND ACTIVE IN FIGURE INURED TO HARDSHIP ACCUSTOMED TO THE BURNING SUN LIGHT SHIELDS HANG AGAINST THE TREES WITH BOWS AND GAILY PAINTED QUIVERS FULL OF ARROWS AND NEAR EACH MAN
AND HEARD HOW COMPLETELY THE HOSTILE FACTION WERE THE MASTERS OF CARTHAGE HE AGREED THAT THE COUNSELS OF THE OLD NOBLEMAN WERE WISE AND THAT MALCHUS COULD HAVE DONE NO GOOD WHEREAS HE WOULD HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH
AS FIGHTING MEN BELONGING TO ONE OF THE LATIN TRIBES THEN HE MADE INQUIRIES ON THE QUAY AND FINDING THAT A SMALL ITALIAN CRAFT WAS TO START THAT AFTERNOON FOR BRUNDUSIUM HE WENT ON BOARD AND ACCOSTED THE CAPTAIN
WHEN WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN RIDDING CARTHAGE OF HER TYRANTS WE MUST NEXT DO ALL WE CAN SO TO RAISE THE CONDITION OF THE COMMON PEOPLE THAT THEY MAY FEEL THAT THEY TOO HAVE A COMMON INTEREST IN THE FATE OF OUR COUNTRY I SHOULD NOT OF COURSE PROPOSE GIVING TO THEM A VOTE
CONSTANTLY REPLENISHED BY THEIR ALLIES AND MOVE WHERE THEY MIGHT THEY WERE SURE OF OBTAINING SUBSISTENCE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THUS UPON THE MARCH THEY WERE UNEMBARRASSED BY THE NECESSITY OF TAKING A GREAT BAGGAGE TRAIN WITH THEM AND WHEN HALTED
WE OLD MEN BOW MORE RESIGNEDLY TO THE DECREES OF THE GODS YOU KNOW THE SAYING THOSE WHOM THE GODS WOULD DESTROY THEY FIRST STRIKE WITH MADNESS CARTHAGE IS SUCH
THEN THERE WAS THE SLAUGHTER OF A SCORE OF CAPTIVES TAKEN IN WAR I SEE THEM NOW STANDING PALE AND STERN WITH THEIR EYES DIRECTED TO THE BRAZEN IMAGE WHICH WAS SOON TO BE SPRINKLED WITH THEIR BLOOD WHILE THE PRIESTS IN THEIR SCARLET ROBES
THEY ARE NAKED TO THE WAIST SAVE FOR A LIGHT BREASTPLATE OF BRASS A CLOTH OF BRIGHT COLOURS IS WOUND ROUND THEIR WAIST AND DROPS TO THE KNEES AND THEY WEAR BELTS OF LEATHER EMBOSSED WITH BRASS PLATES ON THEIR FEET
WHERE THEY JOINED THE FORCE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT THERE AND WHICH HAD IN OBEDIENCE TO VARRO'S ORDERS ATTACKED THE CARTHAGINIAN CAMP BUT HAD BEEN REPULSED WITH A LOSS OF TWO THOUSAND MEN ALL THE TROOPS IN BOTH CAMPS WERE FORCED TO SURRENDER ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
THE LAD SAID THE SHADOWS ARE LENGTHENING AND THE HEAT IS DECLINING WE HAVE ONLY YOUR WORD FOR THE DECLINE OF THE HEAT MALCHUS ONE OF THE YOUNGER MEN LAUGHED I FEEL HOTTER THAN EVER
AND FORMED IT IN ORDER OF BATTLE LEAVING EIGHT THOUSAND OF HIS MEN TO GUARD HIS CAMP BY THUS DOING HE OBTAINED A POSITION WHICH HE COULD THE BETTER HOLD WITH HIS INFERIOR FORCES WHILE THE ROMANS DEEMING THAT HE INTENDED TO ATTACK THEIR CAMP ON THAT SIDE OF THE RIVER
BUT THESE TERRIBLE RITES FRIGHTEN ME I WAS TAKEN ONCE BY MY FATHER AND I THEN SWORE THAT NEVER AGAIN UNLESS IT BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR ME IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC OFFICE WILL I BE PRESENT AT SUCH A SCENE
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY VARRO WHOSE TURN IT WAS TO COMMAND MARCHED TOWARDS THE HOSTILE CAMP HANNIBAL ATTACKED THE ROMAN ADVANCED GUARD WITH HIS CAVALRY AND LIGHT INFANTRY BUT VARRO HAD SUPPORTED HIS CAVALRY NOT ONLY BY HIS LIGHT TROOPS
WHILE THE INTERIOR IS HUNG WITH SILK PURPLE AND WHITE THE CURTAINS AT EACH END ARE LOOPED BACK WITH GOLD CORD TO ALLOW A FREE PASSAGE OF THE AIR A CARPET FROM THE LOOMS OF SYRIA COVERS THE GROUND
HE FELT TOO THAT THE REASON WHICH HE HAD GIVEN GISCON WAS A VALID ONE HE HAD NO RIGHT
BY ENDEAVOURING FURTHER TO CARRY OUT THE MISSION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN CHARGED MANON KNOWS WHAT IS BEST AND NO DOUBT A PREMATURE ATTEMPT TO EXCITE THE POPULACE TO FORCE HANNO INTO SENDING THE REINFORCEMENTS WE SO MUCH NEED WOULD HAVE NOT ONLY FAILED
AS THE TROOPS MARCHED ON TO THE QUAY THEY WERE FORMED UP IN PARTIES BY THE SIDE OF THE SHIPS WHICH WERE TO CONVEY THEM VERY DIFFERENT WAS THE DEMEANOUR OF THE MEN OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES THE LIBYANS WERE STERN AND SILENT
SO FAR I HAVE TAKEN NO STEP TOWARDS CARRYING OUT YOUR PLANS
IT IS THEIR OWN WRONGS AND NOT THE INJURIES OF CARTHAGE WHICH THEY WOULD AVENGE BUT WE MUST TAKE THEM AS WE FIND THEM ONE CANNOT EXPECT ANY DEEP FEELING OF PATRIOTISM ON THE PART OF THE MASSES WHO IT MUST BE OWNED HAVE NO VERY GREAT REASON
HE WAS READY FOR ARMED INSURRECTION AGAINST THE TYRANTS OF CARTHAGE BUT HE REVOLTED FROM THE THOUGHT OF THIS PLAN FOR A MIDNIGHT MASSACRE
THAT HANNO'S PARTY WOULD BE ON THEIR GUARD IN FUTURE AND THAT THE JUDGES WOULD EFFECT WHOLESALE ARRESTS AND EXECUTIONS WHEREAS WERE THE POPULACE APPEALED TO IN THE MIDST OF THE EXCITEMENT WHICH WOULD BE CAUSED
AND HAD GIVEN PROOF OF MILITARY ABILITY THREE YEARS BEFORE WHEN HE HAD COMMANDED AS CONSUL IN THE ILLYRIAN WAR VARRO BELONGED TO THE POPULAR PARTY
FOR US AFRICA AND SPAIN FOR HER ALL THE REST OF EUROPE AND AS MUCH OF ASIA AS SHE CARES TO TAKE WE COULD LOOK WITHOUT JEALOUSY AT EACH OTHER'S GREATNESS EACH SECURE IN HIS OWN STRENGTH AND POWER
OF A PORTION OF THE REINFORCEMENTS DESTINED FOR HANNIBAL HAMILCAR WAS TO PROCEED IN COMMAND OF THEM AND BUSIED WITH HIS PREPARATION FOR THE START MALCHUS THOUGHT LITTLE MORE OF THE CONSPIRACY WHICH WAS BREWING
LET YOUR FOLLOWER COME NIGHTLY TO ME FOR INSTRUCTIONS
BUT NO SIGNS OF SUCH THOUGHTS WERE APPARENT IN THEIR FACES OR CONVERSATION PRESENTLY A BLAST OF TRUMPETS SOUNDED AND THE BABEL OF VOICES WAS HUSHED AS IF BY MAGIC THE SOLDIERS FELL INTO MILITARY ORDER AND STOOD MOTIONLESS
AS A COARSE AND BRUTAL DEMAGOGUE THE SON OF A BUTCHER AND HAVING HIMSELF BEEN A BUTCHER BUT HE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY AN ABLE MAN AND POSSESSED SOME GREAT QUALITIES THE PRAETOR MARCELLUS
A MINUTE LATER NESSUS SAW A DARK FIGURE COME STEALTHILY ALONG HE STOPPED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE ROADS AND STOOD FOR A FEW SECONDS IN HESITATION
WHO ARE GIVEN TO BANQUETS OR WHOSE LIVES SEEM TO BE PASSED IN LUXURY AND INDOLENCE BUT WHO AT HEART ARE AS EARNEST IN THE CAUSE OF CARTHAGE AS I AM THE PRESENCE OF SUCH MEN AMONG US GIVES A PROBABILITY TO THE TALE THAT THIS IS A GAMBLING HOUSE
NOT A ROMAN CAVALRY SOLDIER REMAINED ALIVE AND UNWOUNDED ON THE FIELD THE ROMAN INFANTRY NOW ADVANCED TO THE CHARGE AND FROM THE NATURE OF HANNIBAL'S FORMATION THEIR CENTRE FIRST CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE HEAD OF THE SALIENT ANGLE
HAD I KNOWN THAT YOU WERE A SCORNER OF THE GODS I WOULD NOT HAVE ASKED YOU TO JOIN IN OUR ENTERPRISE NO GOOD FORTUNE CAN BE EXPECTED TO ATTEND OUR EFFORTS UNLESS WE HAVE THE HELP OF THE GODS THE MATTER IS EASILY MENDED GISCON MALCHUS SAID CALMLY
THIRTY LARGE MERCHANT SHIPS WERE HIRED TO CONVEY THE TROOPS WHO NUMBERED SIX THOUSAND THESE WERE PRINCIPALLY LIBYAN FOOTMEN THE MAIN BODY WITH THE NUMIDIAN HORSE
THE ROMAN ARMY WAS AS BEFORE WATCHING HIM AT A SHORT DISTANCE OFF MALCHUS AT ONCE SOUGHT THE TENT OF THE GENERAL WHOSE SURPRISE AT SEEING HIM ENTER WAS GREAT FOR HE HAD NOT EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD RETURN UNTIL THE SPRING
BY THE DEATH OF HANNO AND HIS PRINCIPAL ADHERENTS THE PEOPLE WOULD RISE AND FINISH WITH THEIR TYRANTS AFTER ALL WHO WISHED TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT HAD GIVEN THEIR OPINIONS THEY PROCEEDED TO DETAILS
HOW GREAT THE HEAT HAS BEEN AT MIDDAY MAY BE SEEN BY THE QUIVERING OF THE AIR AS IT RISES FROM THE GROUND AND BLURS ALL DISTANT OBJECTS IT IS SEEN TOO IN THE ATTITUDES AND APPEARANCE OF A LARGE BODY OF SOLDIERS ENCAMPED IN A GROVE
BUT FIRST LET US HAVE SOME WINE FOR ALL THIS TALKING IS THIRSTY WORK AT BEST THE YOUNG MEN THREW THEMSELVES UPON THE COUCHES AROUND THE ROOM AND WHILE SLAVES BROUGHT ROUND WINE
THE REMAINDER OF THE WINTER PASSED QUIETLY MALCHUS RESUMED HIS POST AS THE COMMANDER OF HANNIBAL'S BODYGUARD BUT HIS DUTIES WERE VERY LIGHT THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME WAS SPENT IN ACCOMPANYING HANNIBAL IN HIS VISITS TO THE CAMPS OF THE SOLDIERS
TESTIFY TO HARD EXERCISE AND A LIFE OF ACTIVITY POWERFUL AS CARTHAGE WAS THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW YEARS HAD SHOWN THAT A LIFE AND DEATH STRUGGLE WITH HER GREAT RIVAL IN ITALY WAS APPROACHING FOR MANY YEARS SHE HAD BEEN A CONQUERING NATION
BY THEM LIE THE HEAVY SWORDS WHICH THEY USE IN CLOSE QUARTERS THE THIRD BODY OF MEN ARE MORE HEAVILY ARMED ON THE GROUND NEAR THE SLEEPERS LIE HELMETS AND MASSIVE SHIELDS THEY HAVE TIGHTLY FITTING JERKINS OF WELL TANNED LEATHER
IT IS TRUE THAT ALL POWER RESTS IN OUR HANDS THAT FROM OUR RANKS THE SENATE IS CHOSEN THE ARMY OFFICERED AND THE LAWS ADMINISTERED BUT THE EXPENSES OF THE STATE ARE VAST THE CONQUERED PEOPLE FRET UNDER THE HEAVY TRIBUTES WHICH THEY HAVE TO PAY
WHERE THE VAST MAGAZINES OF THE ROMANS AT ONCE FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE THUS NOT ONLY OBTAINED POSSESSION OF HIS ENEMY'S SUPPLIES BUT INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE ROMANS AND THE LOW LYING DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN APULIA WHERE ALONE AT THIS EARLY SEASON OF THE YEAR
THEIR GENERAL COULD KEEP HIS ARMY TOGETHER IN READINESS TO STRIKE A BLOW WHENEVER AN OPPORTUNITY OFFERED WHILE HANNIBAL ON THE OTHER HAND WAS FORCED TO SCATTER A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE ARMY IN SEARCH OF PROVISIONS
STILL FURTHER THE GAULS AND SPANIARDS WERE DRIVEN BACK UNTIL THEY NOW FORMED AN ANGLE IN REAR OF THE ORIGINAL LINE AND IN THIS ANGLE THE WHOLE OF THE ROMAN INFANTRY IN A CONFUSED MASS PRESSED UPON THEM THIS WAS THE MOMENT FOR WHICH HANNIBAL HAD WAITED
WHEN IT WAS PHOENICIAN ARMS ALONE THAT WON OUR BATTLES AND SUBDUED OUR RIVALS IN OUR DAYS WE ARE FEW AND THE POPULACE ARE MANY OUR ARMIES ARE COMPOSED NOT OF PHOENICIANS BUT OF THE RACES CONQUERED BY US LIBYA AND NUMIDIA
THEN FOLLOWED A SLAUGHTER UNEQUALLED IN THE RECORDS OF HISTORY UNABLE TO OPEN OUT TO FIGHT OR TO FLY WITH NO QUARTER ASKED OR GIVEN THE ROMANS AND THEIR LATIN ALLIES FELL BEFORE THE SWORDS OF THEIR ENEMIES TILL
ALTHOUGH ENGAGED IN A CONSPIRACY IN WHICH THEY RISKED THEIR LIVES IT WAS NOT UNTIL SOME MINUTES AFTER THE SLAVES HAD LEFT THE APARTMENT THAT THE LIGHT TALK AND BANTER CEASED AS GISCON ROSE AND SAID NOW TO BUSINESS
MATTERS ARE GETTING RIPE I HAVE EIGHT MEN SWORN INTO MY SECTION AMONG THE WEAVERS
STAND ROCKING THEMSELVES FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE EXTERIOR OF THE TENT IS MADE OF COARSE WHITE CANVAS THIS IS THICKLY LINED BY FOLD AFTER FOLD OF A THIN MATERIAL DYED A DARK BLUE TO KEEP OUT THE HEAT OF THE SUN
SATISFIED TO BE WEALTHY LUXURIOUS AND SLOTHFUL TO CARRY ON HER TRADE TO KEEP HER RICHES CARING NOTHING FOR THE MANLY VIRTUES INDIFFERENT TO VALOUR PREPARING HERSELF SLOWLY AND SURELY TO FALL AN EASY PREY TO ROME
AND CARTHAGE INSTEAD OF BEING DEPENDENT ENTIRELY UPON HER TRIBUTARIES AND MERCENARIES WOULD BE ABLE TO PLACE A GREAT ARMY IN THE FIELD BY HER OWN UNAIDED EXERTIONS THE BARBARIAN TRIBES WOULD CEASE TO REVOLT
VARRO PLACED HIS INFANTRY IN CLOSE AND HEAVY ORDER SO AS TO REDUCE THEIR FRONT TO THAT OF THE CARTHAGINIANS THE ROMAN CAVALRY NUMBERING TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MEN WAS ON HIS RIGHT WING AND WAS THUS OPPOSED TO HANNIBAL'S HEAVY CAVALRY EIGHT THOUSAND STRONG
ON THE RIGHT BANK OF THE AUFIDUS THE NEXT MORNING EMILIUS WHO WAS IN COMMAND DETACHED A THIRD OF HIS FORCE ACROSS THE RIVER AND ENCAMPED THEM THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING THE ROMAN FORAGING PARTIES ON THAT SIDE AND OF INTERRUPTING THOSE OF THE CARTHAGINIANS
SUCH ARE THE NATURAL SENTIMENTS OF YOUR AGE AND METHINKS WERE MY OWN TIME TO COME OVER AGAIN I TOO WOULD CHOOSE SUCH A LIFE IN PREFERENCE TO AN EXISTENCE IN THE POLLUTED ATMOSPHERE OF UNGRATEFUL CARTHAGE AND NOW
AND THE TWO AT ONCE SET OUT FOR HIS HOUSE
KNOWING THAT SUCCESS WOULD BE HOPELESS AND AS WE SHOULD BE STRONG AT HOME WE SHOULD BE RESPECTED ABROAD AND MIGHT VIEW WITHOUT APPREHENSION THE RISING POWER OF ROME THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR BOTH OF US
MALCHUS GAVE HIM AN ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE SINCE HE LEFT HIM HANNIBAL WAS INDIGNANT IN THE EXTREME AT HANNO HAVING VENTURED TO ARREST AND CONDEMN HIS AMBASSADOR WHEN HE LEARNED THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW WITH MANON
FORMED BY THE GAULS AND SPANIARDS THESE RESISTED WITH GREAT OBSTINACY THE PRINCIPES WHO FORMED THE SECOND LINE OF THE ROMAN INFANTRY CAME FORWARD AND JOINED THE SPEARMEN AND EVEN THE TRIARII PRESSED FORWARD AND JOINED IN THE FIGHT
FROM TRADITION TRAINING AND HABIT BRAVE TO EXCESS JUST AS CENTURIES LATER THE NOBLESSE OF FRANCE CHATTED GAILY ON THE TUMBRIL ON THEIR WAY TO EXECUTION AND OFFERED EACH OTHER THEIR SNUFF BOXES ON THE SCAFFOLD
SCARCE A WORD WAS TO BE HEARD AMONG THEM AS THEY STOOD AWAITING THE ORDERS TO EMBARK THEY WERE THERE UNWILLINGLY AND THEIR HEARTS WERE FAR AWAY IN THE DISTANT DESERT BUT NONE THE LESS WOULD THEY BE WILLING TO FIGHT WHEN THE TIME CAME
THE ANNUAL ELECTIONS AT ROME HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE AND TERENTIUS VARRO AND EMILIUS PAULUS HAD BEEN CHOSEN CONSULS EMILIUS BELONGED TO THE ARISTOCRATIC PARTY
WE DARE NOT MEET SECRETLY YOU KNOW THE CITY IS FULL OF SPIES AND DOUBTLESS THE MOVEMENTS OF ALL KNOWN TO BE HOSTILE TO HANNO AND HIS PARTY ARE WATCHED THEREFORE WE THOUGHT IT BEST TO MEET HERE
A GOLD BELT ENCIRCLES HIS WAIST BELOW IT HANGS A GARMENT RESEMBLING THE MODERN KILT BUT REACHING HALFWAY BETWEEN THE KNEE AND THE ANKLE IT IS DYED A RICH PURPLE
IN THE MEANTIME YOU MUST FOR A SHORT TIME REMAIN IN CONCEALMENT WHILE I ARRANGE FOR A SHIP TO CARRY YOU BACK TO ITALY
WE HAVE NOT YET SETTLED WHETHER IT WILL BE BETTER TO SEPARATE WHEN THIS IS DONE CONTENT WITH THE FIRST BLOW AGAINST OUR TYRANTS OR TO PREPARE BEFOREHAND FOR A POPULAR RISING TO PLACE OURSELVES AT THE HEAD OF THE POPULACE
THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF THE REIGNING BEAUTIES OF CARTHAGE AND OTHER SIMILAR TOPICS AND MALCHUS WHO WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THE SECRET CONSPIRACY WHICH HE HAD JUST SWORN TO AID COULD NOT HELP BEING SURPRISED AT THE CARELESS GAIETY OF THE YOUNG MEN
IN ITALY ROME LOOMS GREATER AND MORE POWERFUL YEAR BY YEAR HER PEOPLE ARE HARDY AND TRAINED TO ARMS AND SOME DAY THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN US AND HER WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT OUT TO THE DEATH THEREFORE MY SON
THE LANGUAGE WITH WHICH ALL WHO TRADED ON THE MEDITERRANEAN WERE FAMILIAR HE SUPPOSED THAT THEY HAD IN SOME WAY EMBROILED THEMSELVES WITH THE AUTHORITIES AT BRUNDUSIUM AND HAD FLED FOR AWHILE UNTIL THE MATTER BLEW OVER
WE WANT TO CROSS TO ITALY HE SAID BUT WE HAVE OUR REASONS FOR NOT WISHING TO LAND AT BRUNDUSIUM AND WOULD FAIN BE PUT ASHORE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN WE ARE READY OF COURSE TO PAY EXTRA FOR THE TROUBLE THE REQUEST DID NOT SEEM STRANGE TO THE CAPTAIN
ARE THREE OR FOUR LIGHT SHORT JAVELINS THEY WEAR ROUND CAPS OF METAL WITH A BAND OF THE SKIN OF THE LION OR OTHER WILD ANIMAL
IF THEY KNOW THAT IN STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AS WELL AS IN POSITION THEIR COMMANDER IS THE FOREMOST MAN IN HIS ARMY MALCHUS HAD BEEN AN APT PUPIL AND HAD DONE JUSTICE TO THE PAINS WHICH HIS FATHER HAD BESTOWED UPON HIM AND TO THE TRAINING HE HAD UNDERGONE
SOME LIBYAN GROOMS ARE RUBBING DOWN THE COATS OF FOUR HORSES OF THE PUREST BREED OF THE DESERT WHILE TWO NUBIANS ARE FEEDING WITH LARGE FLAT CAKES THREE ELEPHANTS WHO CHAINED BY THE LEG TO TREES
EVEN AT THE CERTAIN RISK OF YOUR LIFE AND TO SUFFER YOURSELF TO BE TORN TO PIECES BY THE TORTURE RATHER THAN REVEAL AUGHT THAT PASSES WITHIN THESE WALLS THAT I SWEAR SOLEMNLY MALCHUS SAID I NEED NOT SAY
PAULA ALWAYS TOLD HIM BIBLE STORIES FOR THAT SEEMED TO BE HIS CHIEF PLEASURE AND I TAUGHT HIM TO READ
THAT WAS IT TO DO SOMETHING FOR OTHERS THAT WAS THE PRINCIPAL THING IN ALL HER THOUGHTS IN SCHOOL PAULA NEVER DID WIN PRIZES NOR DID I BOTH OF US WERE GENERALLY ABOUT ON AN EQUAL LEVEL AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR CLASS
PATIENCE PATIENCE CRIED MY FATHER YOUR TURN WILL COME TERESA YOU ARE GETTING OLD AND ANOTHER GIRL IN THE HOUSE SIMPLY MEANS MORE WORK FOR YOU AND A LOT MORE PROBLEMS FOR ME IF SHE
YOU MUST GET TO BED AND DON'T LET'S TALK ANY MORE TONIGHT I DREAMED OF PAULA THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG I SAW HER EITHER DYING OR DEAD OR IN HEAVEN WITH THE ANGELS BUT IN THE MORNING ALL MY FEARS HAD DISAPPEARED AND A FEW DAYS LATER I EVEN FORGOT THE WHOLE THING
THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY SHED OVER OTHERS EVA LECOMTE
SHE WANTS YOU TO COME NEARER THAT SHE MAY FEEL YOUR FACE THE BLIND HAVE NO OTHER EYES PAULA KNEELED AT MARGUERITE'S SIDE AND THE BLIND GIRL PASSED HER HANDS GENTLY OVER THE UPTURNED FACE
MUCH MORE EMBARRASSED IN HIS PRESENCE THAN SHE HAD BEEN WITH US IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE SCHOOL UNIFORM THAT DID IT BUT LOUIS LIKE THE GOOD HEARTED LAD THAT HE WAS DID WHAT HE COULD TO MAKE HER FEEL AT HOME PRESENTLY
HE TAKES IT STAINED AND SCARRED WITH SIN AND THEN HE MAKES IT WHITE LIKE THE SNOW DON'T YOU SEE LISITA YES I SEE I SAID DO YOU REALLY SEE DEAR LISITA
NOTWITHSTANDING THIS
SAVED THAT NIGHT ON OUR RETURN WE POURED INTO TERESA'S SYMPATHETIC EARS ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED DURING OUR EVENTFUL VISIT THAT AFTERNOON AT CELESTINA'S HOUSE THEN SOMEWHAT LATER AS I WAS HELPING HER WITH THE DISHES IN THE KITCHEN TERESA SAID DO YOU KNOW LISITA
IN SCHOOL I TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE IN FACT I TALKED ABOUT HER ALL DAY AND EVERY DAY I LEARNED NOTHING NOR COULD I SEEM TO DO ANYTHING AROUND THE HOUSE
OH YES I HEARD IT SAID LOUIS ILL HUMOREDLY WELL THEN WE MUST GO OH NOT YET
THAT WE USED TO SEE IN THE PARIS MAGAZINES THEY WERE KNOWN LOCALLY AS THE RED COTTAGES A LONG AVENUE OF ANCIENT ELMS SEPARATED US FROM THESE HOUSES OF OUR NEIGHBORS
FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE VILLAGERS THEMSELVES EACH ONE HAD A SMALL SPACE FOR FLOWERS IN FRONT AND A VEGETABLE GARDEN BEHIND OF COURSE
WE DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING BESIDES I DO IT FOR YOU AND LISITA FOR IF YOU WERE BOYS INSTEAD OF GIRLS THERE WOULD BE NO REASON TO RETURN SO EARLY NOW UP WITH YOU YES OR NO
THEN WHY DID YOU RUN SO FAST TERESA ASKED I SAID NOTHING BUT SOON ROSA ALSO ARRIVED AND AFTER TEA I PUT ALL MY BOOKS IN ORDER REDRESSED MY DOLLS GOT RID OF THE INK ON MY HANDS WITH PUMICE STONE
AND TERESA SEEMED TO HESITATE TO EXPRESS HERSELF THEN FINALLY SHE CONTINUED I CANNOT SEEM TO SHAKE OFF THE FEELING THAT SHE WILL NOT BE WITH US MUCH LONGER I BELIEVE SOMEHOW I KNOW IT SOUNDS ABSURD IN ONE WAY
AND THE BRETON SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY IT'S TOO LATE NOW TO GET ANYTHING OF THAT SORT IN THIS DULL HEAD
HE SAID AS HE STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR KITCHEN
AMICABLY WITH US AS TO LOUIS HE SOON SHOWED US THAT HE WAS NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN THE ARRIVAL OF HIS YOUNG COUSIN
DON'T CRY MOTHER SHE SAID AS SHE CAUGHT A LOW SOB FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
NOT I SAID PAULA WITH A HEIGHTENED COLOR LOUIS WAS FURIOUS NO YOU SAY OH HE LAUGHED THE WALL'S TOO HIGH PAULA LOOKED AT THE WALL IT WAS CERTAINLY HIGH
LOOK HERE PAULA YOU FORGOT THE LADDER TAKE IT AWAY NOW IF YOU WANT US TO PLAY UP TO ALL YOUR NONSENSE
SHE'S MUCH BIGGER AND STRONGER AND MORE VIGOROUS THAN EVEN I AM AND BESIDES I NEVER NEVER COULD BEAR IT TO HAVE PAULA TAKEN FROM ME HUSH HUSH CHILD DON'T SHOUT THAT WAY
AND CLEARER AS THEY RATTLED OVER THE PAVEMENT OF THE DESERTED STREET
STUDIOUS AND PATIENT IN ORDER TO BE AN EXAMPLE TO PAULA WHO WOULD SEE MY GOOD QUALITIES AND WOULD THUS ENDEAVOR TO IMITATE ME NEVERTHELESS I BECAME ABSOLUTELY INSUFFERABLE MY OLDER SISTERS WITHOUT BEING QUITE SO ENTHUSIASTIC AS I WAS
FELT THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN ALSO TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE ENGLISH SPEAKING WORLD NOT ONLY THAT THEY MIGHT KNOW PAULA HERSELF BUT THAT THROUGH HER THEY MIGHT BECOME MORE INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH PAULA'S SAVIOUR
I PROFITED BY THIS DIVERSION TO COME RAPIDLY DOWN THE LADDER I WAS ALMOST AT THE HOUSE ANSWERED PAULA COMING NEARER BUT I DIDN'T GO IN BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO MEET TERESA WHY NOT
I HAD A WILD DESIRE TO RUN OUT IN THE DARK TO RECEIVE MY YOUNG COUSIN FOR WHOM I HAD WAITED ALL THESE WEEKS BUT SOMETHING SEEMED TO DETAIN ME THEN WHILE I WAITED QUESTIONING MYSELF AS TO WHAT I WOULD SAY TO PAULA
BUT WHEN I GET THINKING OF THE FACT THAT YOU NEVER REALLY HAVE GIVEN YOUR HEART TO HIM AND IF ONE OF US SHOULD DIE I COULD NOT BEAR ANOTHER WORD THE VERY IDEA OF DEATH EITHER FOR PAULA OR MYSELF WAS SIMPLY UNBEARABLE STOP I CRIED
CLEARLY ENGRAVED ON THE WALLS OF MY MEMORY THERE STILL REMAINS A PICTURE OF THE GREAT GRAY HOUSE WHERE I SPENT MY CHILDHOOD IT WAS ORIGINALLY USED FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AS THE CONVENT OF THE WHITE LADIES WITH ITS FOUR LONG GALLERIES
PAULA OBEDIENTLY RAN AND RETURNED WITH THE REQUIRED LADDER AND HELPED LOUIS PUT IT IN POSITION SAYING AT THE SAME TIME BUT LOUIS YOU KNOW WELL THAT TERESA TOLD US THAT WE MUST BE IN AT NINE O'CLOCK
AND NOW MADEMOISELLE WILL YOU CONTINUE TO HELP ME AS YOU PROMISED TO DO YES OF COURSE SAID PAULA
WAS A MUCH MORE PRETENTIOUS AFFAIR WITH ITS DEEP WELL
FOR WE HAD LOST OUR OWN DEAR MOTHER WHEN I WAS STILL IN THE CRADLE MY BROTHER AND I HAD QUARRELLED OVER A MERE NOTHING WHEN WE WERE CALLED IN TO TEA BY OUR FATHER OF COURSE WE DID NOT DARE CONTINUE OUR DISPUTE OPENLY IN FRONT OF HIM
IF I HAD BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE MY VICTORIA IN SCHOOL SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME AS WISE AND LEARNED AS YOU MESDEMOISELLES SHE WOULD SAY A BIT SADLY AT TIMES BUT THERE I CAN'T COMPLAIN
BRONZED WITH THE SUN AND AIR SHOWED HEALTH AND INTELLIGENCE
IT COULD NOT HIDE PAULA'S BEAUTY HER FOREHEAD WAS BROAD AND INTELLIGENT HER LARGE BROWN EYES WERE FULL OF A CERTAIN SWEETNESS AND A LOVELY SMILE PLAYED ON HER HALF OPENED LIPS COME
NOW HURRY UP AND JUMP WE'LL FIX IT UP AND WATER IT AND SHE'LL KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OH LOUIS I'M AFRAID
I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEW FOR THE POOR I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT I WONDER WHAT THE LORD JESUS MUST THINK OF ME HE GAVE HIS LIFE FOR ME AND HERE I AM NOT WILLING TO LEARN SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP ME TO PUT CLOTHES ON POOR FOLKS OH I MUST I MUST LEARN TO SEW NO MATTER WHAT IT COSTS
AND BESIDES SO MARVELOUSLY BEAUTIFUL BUT I DRIED MY TEARS AS BEST I COULD
AND AS I LOOKED AT HER TALL WELL DEVELOPED FIGURE OUTLINED AGAINST THE WINDOW I LAUGHED AT MY FOOLISH FEARS
AND ALSO TO WAIT FOR THE LITTLE ORPHAN TO BE PLACED IN HIS CARE
ONE ABOVE THE OTHER LOOKING PROUDLY DOWN UPON THE HUMBLER DWELLINGS OF THE VILLAGE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BUT A GIRL TERESA SPOKE VERY LITTLE AS TO PAULA BUT I AM PERSUADED THAT LONG BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF OUR LITTLE ORPHAN COUSIN SHE HAD BEEN GIVEN A LARGE PLACE IN OUR OLD SERVANT'S HEART SHE FOUND A LITTLE WHITE BED UP IN THE ATTIC
THEREFORE WITH MY HEART TORN AND DESOLATED AS IT IS I DON'T FEEL CALLED UPON TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY UPON MYSELF OTHER THAN THAT OF MY OWN CHILDREN THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF TRUTH IN WHAT YOU SAY TERESA YES SIR
NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO RESIST PAULA WHEN SHE BEGINS TO SPEAK OF GOD'S LOVE SHE SEEMS TRULY INSPIRED BY HIS HOLY SPIRIT CHILD THOUGH SHE IS SHE SURELY IS HIS MESSENGER TO ALL WITH WHOM SHE COMES IN CONTACT BUT THERE'S JUST ONE THING
COME NOW WON'T YOU MY BROTHER SEEMED TO HESITATE YOU KNOW I HATED TO DISOBEY ADDED PAULA WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AND AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T LIKE TO BE A TATTLE TALE WON'T YOU PLEASE COME HOME NOW WITH ME
FROM WHICH ON A SUNDAY MORNING PEALED OUT THE CHEERFUL CALL TO PRAYER AND WORSHIP THE ANCIENT CONVENT LONG BEFORE OUR STORY BEGINS HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO A LOVELY DWELLING WITH AN IMMENSE GARDEN ON ONE SIDE
THE BRETON KNOWS VERY WELL THAT WHEN YOUR FATHER GOT RID OF HIM HE WELL DESERVED IT SAID TERESA AS SHE ADJUSTED HER SPECTACLES AND SETTLED DOWN TO HER KNITTING MY FATHER DID NOT KEEP HIM LONG
LOUIS WAS A GOOD HEARTED LAD IN SPITE OF HIS SHORTCOMINGS THEREFORE SEEING HIS YOUNG COUSIN BEGINNING TO CRY HE SAID ALL RIGHT LET'S GO ANYWAY I CAN'T PLAY THE WAY I WANT ESPECIALLY WITH A PAIR OF YOUNGSTERS LIKE YOU TWO BUT
BUT NIGHT HAD ARRIVED THE LAMPS HAD BEEN LIGHTED AND WE HAD RESIGNED OURSELVES TO WAIT WITHOUT THE CONSOLATION OF SEEING THE ROAD FROM THE WINDOW THEN SUDDENLY OH JOY WE HEARD A FAINT SOUND OF WHEELS IN THE DISTANCE THEN CLEARER
TRANSLATOR'S NOTE PAULA WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN FRENCH AND TRANSLATED FROM THENCE INTO SPANISH AND THE PRESENT TRANSLATOR HAVING DISCOVERED THIS LITERARY AND SPIRITUAL JEWEL
BUT IT IS VERY BAD VERY BAD IF YOU WILL LET ME SAY SO I KNOW I OUGHT NOT TO TALK SO AS I'M ONLY A POOR OLD SERVANT BUT REMEMBER I WAS THE ONE THAT BROUGHT UP THE LOVELY WOMAN THAT WE ALL MOURN FOR
HOW GLAD I AM EXCLAIMED PAULA YES MADEMOISELLE BUT I HAVE YOU TO THANK FOR YOUR GREAT KINDNESS TO ME
IF TERESA HAD NOT AT THIS MOMENT COME INTO THE GARDEN WITH A BLACK BORDERED LETTER IN HER HAND WHICH SHE DELIVERED TO OUR FATHER HE TOOK IT SILENTLY AND OPENED IT AS TERESA CARRIED AWAY THE TEA POT
PAULA WAS NOW FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE
IN ANTICIPATION I HAD FANCIED PAULA AS A PALE SAD LITTLE GIRL WITH BLUE EYES FULL OF TEARS SHE WOULD HAVE GOLDEN HAIR VERY SMOOTH CUT OFF AT THE BASE OF HER EARS
IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IN THE LEAST TO SEE THE BRETON CONVERTED
IF YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO OBEY TERESA YOU'LL NEVER HAVE A QUIET MOMENT THEN ARE YOU TOO GOING TO STAY WITH LOUIS PAULA ASKED SADLY OF COURSE CRIED LOUIS WITHOUT GIVING ME TIME TO REPLY
A WEEK PASSED AND WE HAD SEEN NOTHING OF THE BRETON PAULA MENTIONED HIM SEVERAL TIMES
BESIDES SHE'LL NEVER KNOW I THINK SHE'S OUT WELL SHE'LL KNOW WHEN SHE RETURNS SHE'LL ASK US WHAT TIME WE CAME IN
WIDE RIBBON OF THE SAME COLOR FAILED TO ENTIRELY HIDE A MAGNIFICENT HEAD OF BROWN HAIR GATHERED BENEATH HER CAP AFTER THE MANNER OF THE WALDENSIANS HER SIMPLE DRESS OF BLACK AND GRAY STRIPES REACHED ALMOST TO HER ANKLES
OH OH I CRIED VIEWING THE RUIN THAT LOUIS HAD MADE NOW WON'T TERESA BE ANGRY INDEED WELL WHY SHOULD I CARE SAID LOUIS
GO TELL THE BRETON TO COME INTO THE KITCHEN LISITA SAID TERESA I WONDERED AS I SAW HIM ENTER WITH SUCH A HUMBLE FRANK AIR AND WITH A NEW LOOK OF PEACE THAT SEEMED ALMOST TO BEAUTIFY THE BRUTALIZED FACE MADEMOISELLE PAULA
TO WORSE BUT AT LAST AT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON I REACHED THE HOUSE BREATHLESS ONLY TO FIND THAT PAULA HAD NOT YET COME THEY ARE NOT COMING I CRIED IMPATIENTLY I KNEW THEY WOULDN'T BE HERE
AS THE DAUGHTER OF HER BELOVED SISTER SHE STOPPED SUDDENLY SLIGHTLY ABASHED AS SHE REALIZED THAT PERHAPS SHE HAD SAID A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR ONE IN HER STATION IN LIFE BUT MORE THAN HER MERE WORDS HER VOICE
WHO MY FATHER INTERRUPTED HER WITHOUT CEREMONY
TRYING TO REMEMBER ALL THE MANY COUNSELS OF TERESA OUR OLD SERVANT STAGGERED IN FROM THE YARD WITH A GREAT BAG IN EACH HAND THEN OUR FATHER ENTERED WITH A YOUNG GIRL AT HIS SIDE DRESSED IN BLACK PAULA HAD COME
AND AS I LOOKED AT THAT PURE BEAUTIFUL FACE WITH THE EYES CLOSED IN PRAYER WITH ITS FRAME OF GLORIOUS HAIR I KNEW THAT NEVER HAD I SEEN ANYTHING SO LOVELY AS THIS CHILD COMPANION OF MINE JUST BUDDING INTO WOMANHOOD
BESIDE ALL THAT WE COULD CLEARLY HEAR THE HOUR STRIKE IN THE GREAT CLOCK ON DARNETAL CHURCH LISTEN CRIED PAULA WOEFULLY IT'S NINE O'CLOCK AND TERESA SAID WE MUST GO BACK TO THE HOUSE AT NINE OH SHUT UP
TERESA MADE A MAGNIFICENT APPLE CAKE AS A SIGN OF HER PLEASURE MY FATHER ALSO SHOWED HIS GREAT SATISFACTION AND IN FACT EVERYBODY REJOICED TO SEE THAT AT LAST WE WERE BOTH MAKING PROGRESS IN SPITE OF ALL HOWEVER THERE WAS ONE GREAT HEAVY WEIGHT ON MY HEART
THEN SUDDENLY PAULA SHE CALLED PAULA HERE I AM MARGUERITE AND PAULA CAME CLOSER TAKING HER HAND AH YOU ARE HERE THANKS DEAR PAULA SHE GASPED
ONE AFTERNOON WE SAID GOOD BYE TO GABRIEL AND MOUNTED THE STAIRS TO VISIT THE BLIND GIRL LEFT ALONE FOR MOST OF THE DAY SHE PASSED THE LONG HOURS KNITTING SHE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS OUR CATALINA BUT SHE APPEARED TO BE MUCH OLDER
EDGED BY A DOZEN LITTLE BRICK HOUSES THAT SEEMED
ONLY MY MARGUERITE FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS SHE BECAME OUR CONSTANT DELIGHT
TELL US FATHER PLEASE ADDED MY SISTER ROSA A TALL SERIOUS GIRL OF FIFTEEN
THEN JUST AS SUDDENLY
A BLACK SHAWL WHOSE POINTS PASSED UNDER HER ARMS AND WERE KNOTTED BEHIND PROTECTED HER SHOULDERS WHILE A PAIR OF GREAT THICK SHOES COMPLETED HER ATTIRE IN SPITE OF WHAT TO OUR MIND WAS A CERTAIN QUAINT ODDNESS IN HER DRESS
NONSENSE YOU FOOLISH YOUNGSTER THAT'S NOT A LIE WE'LL GO FROM HERE AT THE DOT OF NINE ACCORDING TO MY WATCH AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL TELL TERESA IN CASE SHE ASKS US OF COURSE IF SHE DOESN'T ASK US
FROM THE KITCHEN WE COULD HEAR THE DOOR OPEN AND MY FATHER'S VOICE BIDDING THE BRETON A KINDLY GOOD NIGHT
SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN CONTINUED IN HER QUIET SIMPLE WAY
I'M AFRAID THE LITTLE FOOL IS GOING TO BECOME IMPOSSIBLE NOW DO AS I DO BUT BE SURE AND DON'T BREAK YOUR NOSE FOR TERESA WILL BLAME ME YOU JUMP FIRST I SAID GETTING AFRAID ARE YOU
JUST AT THIS MOMENT WE HEARD A VOICE CALLING
AS SHE STARTED TO COME TO MY RESCUE IT'S THE BRETON I SAID
CERTAINLY NOT SNEERED LOUIS TERESA WOULD NEVER GIVE PERMISSION NOW HURRY UP YOU'RE FIRST ON THE WALL PAULA NO I'M NOT GOING TO STAY TERESA WILL BE ANGRY NO NO NEVER FEAR
AND IN BETWEEN EACH TASK TOOK A TURN IN THE GARDEN ON THE PASSING OF ANY COACH BUT ALWAYS WITH THE SAME RESULT WOULD THEY EVER ARRIVE THEN CAME SUPPER TIME
MANY THANKS FOR TELLING ME ABOUT JESUS AND HIS LOVE FOR ME SING THE SENTENCE WAS NEVER FINISHED BUT PAULA'S SWEET VOICE ROSE AS ONCE AGAIN SHE SANG THE SUBLIME WORDS
I DESERVED TO BE REFUSED
IN SUCH A TERRIBLE TONE THAT PAULA I COULD SEE WAS FRIGHTENED YOU MUSTN'T DIE I CANNOT LIVE AND I WON'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU I KNOW I'M NOT GOOD BUT IF YOU WEREN'T HERE TO HELP ME WHAT WOULD I DO MY OVERWROUGHT NERVES
ONE NIGHT WHILE DREAMING I JUMPED FROM THE BED CRYING PAULA PAULA THIS AWAKENED TERESA AND SHE MADE ME TAKE SOME NASTY MEDICINE THINKING I HAD FEVER I MADE PROMISES OF REFORM I WANTED TO BE GOOD
TO RECOVER A BALL AT WHATEVER DISTANCE WHEN A DISPUTE AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD GET IT OR TO LOOK FOR A LOST KITE NO MATTER HOW THICK THE BRAMBLES MIGHT BE NO WONDER LOUIS WAS QUITE CONTENT TO HAVE SUCH AN ACCOMMODATING COMPANION
WE RETURNED WITH OUR APRONS DECORATED WITH MUD BUT STILL HAPPY THE GOOD OLD LADY HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF THE FACT IS THAT WHEN LOUIS PLAYED WITH US HE ALWAYS ACTED AS HE DID WITH THE BOYS AT SCHOOL BUT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED
EDUCATION MY FATHER SMILED A BIT SADLY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT TERESA YES YES I UNDERSTAND HALF OF IT AND I THINK I CAN GUESS AT THE OTHER HALF DO YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU OFFERED LOUIS
THIS IS ROSA AND THEN TURNING TO ME YOU ARE LISITA OH IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU ALL NOW GO AND GREET YOUR COUSIN CATALINA SAID MY FATHER SHE IS THE SICK ONE HE ADDED SOFTLY
NO FIVE MINUTES WON'T MAKE ANY GREAT DIFFERENCE OF COURSE SAID PAULA SLOWLY AND IT CERTAINLY IS LOVELY HERE BUT TERESA ORDERED US IN AT NINE O'CLOCK I'LL RUN AND ASK HER IF WE CANNOT STAY ANOTHER FIFTEEN MINUTES
AND I AM SURE LOUIS NOTICED IT ALSO FOR HE COMPLETELY FORGOT TO RETURN MY KICK
THE FIRST TIME WE HAD VISITED HER SHE HAD HARDLY RAISED HER HEAD FROM HER WORK AND SHOWED BUT LITTLE INTEREST IN THE STORIES THAT HER MOTHER HAD ASKED US TO READ TO HER IT WAS NOT SO MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS AN APPARENT INCAPACITY TO COMPREHEND THE MEANING OF WHAT SHE HEARD
SHE SAID IN A TREMBLING TONE AT THIS MOMENT TERESA ARRIVED CARRYING IN THE FINAL BAG AT LAST SHE SAID EMBRACING PAULA DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM THEN SEEING THAT PAULA VIEWED HER A BIT STRANGELY SHE ADDED
THAT NIGHT I SIMPLY COULDN'T SLEEP I SEEMED TO FEEL MY HANDS IN YOURS AND TO HEAR YOUR VOICE SAYING I'LL DO WHAT I CAN TO HELP YOU AT LAST I COULDN'T STAND IT ANY LONGER I GOT OUT ON THE FLOOR AND KNEELED THERE BEFORE GOD
THE LITTLE OIL LAMP WHICH WE ALWAYS KEPT LIGHTED AT NIGHT IN THE PASSAGEWAY ILLUMINATED HIS PALE FACE AND GAUNT FIGURE GOOD EVENING MADEMOISELLE HE FINALLY MANAGED TO SAY AND THEN HE STOPPED APPARENTLY AS EMBARRASSED AS I WAS
AS SHE SLIGHTLY RAISED THE SICK GIRL'S HEAD DEAREST MARGUERITE SAID OUR TEACHER HERE ARE PAULA AND LISITA
I DECLARE SAID ROSA THINK OF THE BRETON
YOU MADEMOISELLE YOU MADE ME FEEL THAT YOU REALLY LOVED ME
SAID THE OLD WOMAN KINDLY AS TIMIDLY AS A CHILD THE BRETON ADVANCED OVER THE THRESHOLD A FEW PACES
THE REST OF THE LAND AROUND THE CONVENT HAD
THEN I'LL SHOW HER MY WATCH BUT CRIED PAULA QUITE UPSET
NO SHE SAID I'M NOT AFRAID TO JUMP
AT LAST THE GREAT DAY ARRIVED IT WAS A WEDNESDAY
PAULA SAT BACK STIFF AND STRAIGHT IN CONSTERNATION
I AM ONLY OLD TERESA IT WAS I WHO BROUGHT UP YOUR DEAR MOTHER AND I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE TO DO THE SAME WITH YOU BUT IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF YOU WOULDN'T NEED VERY MUCH OF MY CARE YOU ARE SO LARGE AND HEALTHY MUCH BIGGER THAN LISITA HERE
WHICH GAVE US ALMOST AS MUCH JOY AS WE CARRIED THEM TO MARGUERITE AS SHE HERSELF FELT ON RECEIVING THEM ONE DAY GABRIEL CAME RUNNING TO TELL US THAT MARGUERITE WAS QUITE ILL AND WE LOST NO TIME IN GOING TO SEE HER
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON AND OF THE HOLY GHOST
PAULA ARRIVES FOR NEARLY A WEEK I COULDN'T THINK OF ANOTHER THING BUT THE COMING OF PAULA MY FATHER HAD GONE TO PARIS HE WOULD BE THERE SOME DAYS TO ARRANGE CERTAIN IMPORTANT MATTERS OF BUSINESS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS FACTORY
AND SO PAULA SANG HYMN AFTER HYMN AS PAULA AT LAST STOPPED SINGING FOR THE TIME HAD COME TO GO HOME POOR MARGUERITE STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS AS IF GROPING FOR SOMETHING PLEASE DO NOT BE OFFENDED MADEMOISELLE PAULA IMPLORED MADAME BERTIN
THEN AWAY PAULA WOULD GO INTO THE GARDEN OR UNDER THE TREES THAT LINED THE VILLAGE STREET SOON SHE WAS BACK WITH SUCH A HAPPY SMILE THAT TERESA FORGAVE HER COMPLETELY ONCE HOWEVER TERESA LOST ALL PATIENCE WITH HER EXCLAIMING
THAT SHE COULD EVEN BEAT HIM AT THIS
TOUCHING THE SNOW WITH SILVER AND MAKING MILLIONS OF ITS CRYSTALS SPARKLE LIKE DIAMONDS IN THE MOONLIGHT HOW WHITE AND PURE AND BEAUTIFUL EVERYTHING IS SAID PAULA
AND WITH HER HEAD IN HER HAND COMMENCED TO READ TERESA WAS NOT VERY WELL EDUCATED
AND LOUIS TOOK OUT HIS WATCH I CAN FIX THAT MATTER EASILY WE BOTH LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER AT THE WATCH WHICH BY THIS TIME CLEARLY POINTED TO FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE HOUR SUDDENLY WE SAW THE HANDS OF THE WATCH BEGIN TO TURN BACKWARDS
EMBRACE YOUR YOUNG COUSIN AND GIVE HER A HEARTY WELCOME ROSA CAME FORWARD AND I TIMIDLY DID THE SAME BUT PAULA DROPPING FATHER'S HAND RUSHED TOWARD ROSA AND THEN TO ME
CATALINA STILL SUFFERED SOMEWHAT BUT NOW WAS ABLE TO WALK AROUND A BIT WITHOUT CRUTCHES AND IN SPITE OF HER DELICATE HEALTH AND POOR TWISTED BODY SHE HAD COME BRAVELY TO TAKE HER TRUE PLACE AMONG US AS OUR BIG SISTER SO LOVING AND SOLICITOUS FOR EVERYBODY'S WELFARE
WHO HAD COME INTO MY LIFE AND WHO HAD TRANSFORMED SO MANY OTHER LIVES AROUND ME AS SHE ROSE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PRAYER FINDING ME STILL ON MY FEET SHE SAID WITH SURPRISE IN HER TONE NOT IN BED YET LISITA NO
WHEN AT LAST SHE LIFTED HER HEAD HER EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS POOR POOR LITTLE THING SHE REPEATED SOFTLY WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK SAID MY FATHER WHAT DO I THINK
SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I THINK YOU HAVE SAID TO YOURSELF FROM THE TIME THAT MY WIFE DIED LIFE HAS BECOME A BURDEN AND IF IT WASN'T FOR THE CHILDREN I WOULD HAVE DIED OF GRIEF BUT FOR LOVE OF THEM I MUST WORK AND LIVE
VIBRANT WITH EMOTION HAD MOVED US ALL TO THE DEPTHS OF OUR SOULS YOU ARE A VALIANT WOMAN WITH A GREAT HEART MY FATHER SAID AS HE TOOK HER HAND I WILL WRITE THIS VERY NIGHT AND ASK THEM TO SEND THE GIRL TO US AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
THEN THE MOMENT ARRIVED WHEN WE MUST GO BACK TO THE HOUSE THAT FATAL TIME ALWAYS SEEMED TO ARRIVE ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TERESA SELDOM HAD ANY TIME TO COME AND CALL US BUT SHE RELIED ON LOUIS AS HE HAD A WATCH
PAULA THEREFORE HAD TO SUBMIT BUT THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT TERESA HAD ANY REASON TO COMPLAIN THAT AFTERNOON PAULA HAD GONE STRAIGHT TO HER ROOM AND I FOLLOWED SOON AFTER TO COMFORT HER BUT I FOUND HER KNEELING BY HER BEDSIDE
BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT GOD WILL CALL HER TO HIS SIDE SOME DAY SOON OH TERESA I CRIED HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH A THING
AND ITS NOISY BEE HIVES IN FACT IT WAS IN OUR EYES THE MOST ENCHANTING CORNER OF THE EARTH I DON'T REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS ABOUT THE SPECIAL THING THAT HAPPENED ONE DAY BUT I KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT TO THE END OF MY LIFE
I MUST NOT KEEP YOU ANY LONGER FOR I AM SURE YOU HAVE A GREAT DESIRE TO KNOW ABOUT PAULA AND ANYWAY I SUPPOSE YOU WILL HAVE DONE WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE AT YOUR AGE NAMELY READ THE STORY FIRST
MY HEAD WASN'T IN VERY GOOD CONDITION AS I'D LEFT MY WITS BEHIND AT THE LIQUOR SHOP
DROP THAT WORK AND GO WHERE YOU PLEASE BUT REMEMBER THIS NEVER WILL YOU BE CALLED A DORCAS NEVER WILL YOU BE ABLE TO SEW AND PROVIDE GARMENTS FOR THE POOR IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM YOU MUST SHOW IT BY YOUR WORKS AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO LEARN TO BE USEFUL TO THEM
AND WOULD BE DRESSED IN BLACK MUSLIN AND WEAR A STRAW HAT WITH A BLACK RIBBON TIED UNDER HER CHIN BUT HERE WAS A DIFFERENT PAULA SHE WAS LARGE FOR HER AGE AND APPEARED QUITE STRONG HER FRANK OPEN FACE
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOME CHILD THAT CAN'T KNOCK VERY WELL SAID CATALINA
SHE WILL HAVE TO GET UP A LITTLE EARLIER AND GO TO BED A LITTLE LATER AND THAT WILL BE ALL WELL TERESA I'LL THINK ABOUT IT AND IT NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT A GOOD DEAL AND WHY DO YOU SAY THAT SIR
BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR AFTERNOON PAULA STARTED SINGING A HYMN
SHE LOOKED AT ME SURPRISED
BUT WE CONTINUED OUR WAR LIKE ACTIVITIES BY KICKING EACH OTHER UNDER THE TABLE LOUIS WAS TEN YEARS OLD AND I WAS NINE AS HE WAS OLDER AND A BOY
CATALINA HAD BEEN UP AND DRESSED ALL DAY AND WOULD NOT HEAR OF GOING TO BED UNTIL PAULA CAME
SHE LAUGHED WHAT PUT SUCH A NOTION IN YOUR HEAD DO I LOOK AS IF I WAS SICK I WAS SO RELIEVED TERESA WAS QUITE MISTAKEN NO CONTINUED PAULA
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN THE FUTURE IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THESE THINGS I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW PAULA WOULD SAY SADLY AND WOULD TAKE UP THE WORK ONCE MORE WITH SUCH SWEET RESIGNATION THAT TERESA MOVED WITH COMPASSION
IF SHE HAPPENED TO FALL AND HURT HERSELF SHE'D RUB AN INJURED KNEE WITH A LAUGH OR SUCKED A STUBBED FINGER WITHOUT FURTHER COMMENT AND GO ON PLAYING AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED BUT IN SPITE OF ENTERING WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO ALL OUR FUN
PAULA GOT DOWN FROM HER CHAIR AND STOOD IN FRONT OF HER NOW COOLING CUP OF HOT MILK SHE PLACED HER HANDS TOGETHER CLOSING HER EYES AND BENDING HER HEAD A LITTLE SHE SAID SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY IN A LOW VOICE
HER SPECIAL SUMMER DELIGHT WAS TO RUN THROUGH THE FIELDS ALWAYS RETURNING TO THE HOUSE WITH A BIG BUNCH OF WILD FLOWERS FOR CATALINA IN ONE THING ONLY SHE ALWAYS SEEMED TO FAIL TERESA HAD A FEARFUL TASK IN TEACHING HER TO SEW AND TO KNIT
NOW THEN PAULA ARE YOU NOT HUNGRY ASKED TERESA WITH HER HAND ON THE LOCK OF THE KITCHEN DOOR YES MADAME THAT IS YES TERESA BEGIN THEN LISITA DOESN'T NEED ANY URGING
WHERE RAN THE BROAD ROAD FROM ROUEN TO DARNETAL A HIGH RUGGED WALL SURROUNDED A WIDE YARD GUARDED AT THE ENTRANCE BY TWO MASSIVE DOORS STUDDED WITH ENORMOUS SPIKES THE NAKED BARRENNESS OF THIS YARD WAS TO SAY THE LEAST
IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANSY BED
AND I KNEW HER BEFORE YOU DID SIR AND I LOVED HER AS IF SHE WERE MY OWN CHILD WHEN I PUT HER IN THE COFFIN IT WAS AS IF THEY HAD TAKEN OUT A PIECE OF MY OWN HEART SHE WAS SO YOUNG TO DIE SO SWEET SO GOOD
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO READ CONTINUED THE POOR FELLOW
I THINK WE MIGHT EAT A LITTLE BREAD AND JAM TO ACCOMPANY HER I SAID THEN EVERYBODY LAUGHED I THINK LISITA IS RIGHT FOR ONCE SAID TERESA ALWAYS HAPPY WHEN SHE WAS ABLE TO GIVE US A BIT OF PLEASURE AND I THINK PAULA WILL BE A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE THAT WAY
PAULA DREW NEAR THE BIG CHAIR WHERE THE SICK GIRL RE CLINED CATALINA WAS SMILING SADLY AT THE YOUNG STRANGER DO YOU ALSO LOVE ME A LITTLE ASKED MY ELDEST SISTER WITH TENDERNESS AND INFINITE CARE
I WOULD NOT HESITATE BUT TO BRING ANOTHER ORPHAN INTO A FAMILY ALREADY HALF ORPHANED DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME DON'T WORRY SIR A LITTLE MORE WORK DOESN'T WORRY TERESA ROULAND
PAULA SEEMED AFRAID OF NOTHING WHEN IT CAME TO RUNNING RACES
AND I WILL SHOW IT TO YOU SHOW IT TO US NOW I SHOUTED BUT TERESA INTERRUPTED ME WHAT A CHILD YOU ARE WHEN POOR PAULA IS SO TIRED TOMORROW WILL BE TIME ENOUGH
WHEN PAULA HAD FINISHED SHE EXCLAIMED OH MAMMA MAMMA TELL HER TO PLEASE SING AGAIN
I'LL CATCH YOU IF YOU FALL DON'T BE A FRAIDCAT JUST AT THAT MOMENT I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING RATHER THAN JUMP I'M COMING DOWN BY THE LADDER NO YOU'LL DO NO SUCH THING NOW COME ON DON'T BE A COWARD
OH YES SAID THE DYING GIRL
I SAID CONFUSED THAT SHE SHOULD FIND ME STILL SEATED ON THE EDGE OF MY BED LOST IN MY OWN REFLECTIONS PAULA SUDDENLY WENT TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT OH LISITA SHE EXCLAIMED
YOU HARDLY HAVE ANY SIMILIARITY IN YOUR FACE BUT YOUR VOICE IS LIKE HERS NOW LET ME HUG YOU ONCE MORE MY TREASURE AND TERESA PRESSED TO HER HEART THE MOTHERLESS CHILD IN MY COUNTRY THEY SAY I AM LIKE PAPA
THAT'S WHY I'VE COME BACK TO LOOK FOR YOU
THEN WITH ONE OF THOSE SUDDEN MOVEMENTS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE BLIND
THERE CAME TWO HESITATING KNOCKS ON THE OUTER DOOR
I WISH TO SPEAK WITH THE MASTER HE SAID DIRECTING HIS WORDS TO TERESA
THE YEARS PASSED SWIFTLY WITHOUT BRINGING ANY GREAT CHANGES IN OUR QUIET LIFE OUR GRANDPARENTS HAD AGED A BIT AND TERESA WAS NOT QUITE AS ACTIVE AS FORMERLY WHILE A FEW WRINKLES HAD GATHERED ON OUR FATHER'S FOREHEAD BUT ALL THIS HAD COME SO SLOWLY THAT THE CHANGE WAS HARDLY NOTICED
ONE DOESN'T HAVE TO REFLECT LONG ABOUT DOING GOOD WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHY I HESITATE I'M SURE THAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD MUCH BETTER REPLACE THE PARENTS OF THIS ORPHANED GIRL I MUST CONFESS THAT FOR MY PART I DON'T FEEL EQUAL TO THE TASK
SHE SEEMED TO FORGET HER LONG VOYAGE AND HER WEARINESS AS SHE REPEATED TO EACH ONE OF US IN HER MELODIOUS VOICE I KNOW I SHALL LOVE YOU ALL AND MY UNCLE CHARLES HERE I ALREADY LOVE HIM AND HE HAS TOLD ME ALL YOUR NAMES LET ME SEE
THAT YOU HAD BEEN WITH US FOR MANY MONTHS INSTEAD OF A FEW DAYS
SLIPPING NOISELESSLY BETWEEN FLOWERED BANKS OF FORGET ME NOTS IT WAS BY LOVE THAT SHE CONQUERED AS WE SHALL SEE IF SOME DAY YOU SHOULD COME TO MY COUNTRY DO NOT FORGET THAT I WOULD HAVE GREAT JOY IN SEEING ANY OF THOSE WHO HAVE READ THIS BOOK
IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT OUR SERVANT HAD WELL NAMED HER THE DAUGHTER OF THE GOOD GOD SHE WAS ALWAYS READY TO STEP ASIDE AND LET OTHERS TAKE THE FIRST PLACE
KNOWING THAT LOUIS WAS NOT VERY COURAGEOUS I LEANED MY CHAIR AS FAR INSIDE AS I COULD AND LET HIM HAVE ONE TERRIFIC KICK AT THIS HIS FACE CHANGED COLOR AND MY FATHER NOW DISTURBED BY THE EXTRA NOISE OF MY KICK
FINALLY BEGAN TO REALIZE WHAT WAS HAPPENING
AND I SAID TO MYSELF THAT I WOULD HONOR THE MEMORY OF MY MISTRESS BY DOING ALWAYS THAT WHICH I KNEW SHE WOULD HAVE APPROVED OF AND NOW SIR TAKE THIS LITTLE ORPHAN AS YOU KNOW YOUR GOOD WIFE WOULD HAVE DONE
WHERE IN THE SHADE OF THE GREAT TREES THE OLD MEN OF THE VILLAGE USED TO SIT AND RECOUNT TO US TALES OF THE DAYS WHEN THE CONVENT FLOURISHED SOME OF THESE STORIES MADE US SHIVER INDEED THEY HAD A HABIT OF STRAYING INTO OUR DREAMS AT NIGHT
AND YOU ALSO SAID THAT GOD WOULD CHANGE ME IF I REALLY DESIRED I DIDN'T DARE BELIEVE SUCH A THING MADEMOISELLE IT
PAULA LOOKED AT US ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND THEN LOOKED AT TERESA AS IF SHE WOULD SAY SOMETHING AS TERESA REMAINED LOOKING ON IN AN ASTONISHED MANNER
FORBIDDING IN THE EXTREME BUT THE FERTILE FIELDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE SPREAD THEMSELVES LIKE A VAST AND BEAUTIFUL GREEN CARPET DOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH LITTLE VILLAGES CROWNED WITH CHURCH SPIRES AND THEIR CORRESPONDING BELFRIES
PAULA WHO WAS SEATED ON THE LOWEST RUNG OF THE LADDER IMMEDIATELY STEPPED ASIDE AND SOON LOUIS WAS ON THE WALL NOW IT'S YOUR TURN HE CALLED TO ME I FOLLOWED MY BROTHER AS PAULA SLOWLY MOVED AWAY UP THE GARDEN WALK
WHO WROTE THIS WAS HER FIRST QUESTION THE PASTOR OF THE VILLAGE REPLIED MY FATHER A MINISTER EXCLAIMED TERESA HE'S A MIGHTY POOR WRITER FOR A MINISTER AND NO DOUBT HIS MOTHER PAID MIGHTY WELL FOR HIS
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HER IF SHE SHOULD ASK ME WHERE YOU TWO WERE WELL
THERE YOU ARE PAULA TERESA SAID DRAWING HER TO THE TABLE SIT DOWN AND EAT AND THE OTHERS SAID PAULA LOOKING AT US OH WE ATE LONG AGO SAID ROSA
ONE REGRET ONLY I HAVE MAMMA MARGUERITE SAID AND THAT IS THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOUR FACE OH THAT I MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT JUST ONCE IN HEAVEN INTERRUPTED OUR TEACHER YOUR EYES WILL BE OPEN FOREVER
OH PLEASE LET ME GO ON I WILL TRY TO DO BETTER BUT TERESA HAD TAKEN AWAY THE WORK AND WAS NOT INCLINED TO BE EASILY PERSUADED NO NOT NOW
TERESA LOOKED SCORNFULLY AT LOUIS YOU I SHOULD SAY NOT YOU DON'T CARE TO HELP ME IN THE KITCHEN OR RUN ERRANDS FOR ME AND THE ONLY THING THE MATTER WITH YOU NOW IS CURIOSITY THAT SETTLED LOUIS AND TERESA WENT ON WITH HER READING
NEVERTHELESS SPOKE OFTEN OF PAULA CATALINA BEGAN TO WORRY THAT PAULA MIGHT SUFFER IN OUR HOUSE BUT SHE SOON CONSOLED HERSELF BY REMEMBERING THAT MY FATHER HAD PROMISED TO PUT HER OUT TO BOARD IF IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE COULD NOT GET ALONG
THE FOOD WHICH WE RECEIVE O LORD
WE WERE AT TEA IN THE GARDEN TERESA OUR OLD SERVANT WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN IN HER KITCHEN SHE NEVER SEEMED TO HAVE TIME TO SIT DOWN TO EAT DEAR OLD TERESA SHE ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE A MOTHER TO ME
AND I HAD ALMOST YIELDED WHEN SUDDENLY I CRIED TO THE LORD JESUS TO HELP ME AND THEN A WONDERFUL THING HAPPENED ALL DESIRE FOR THE DRINK WENT AWAY AND I'VE BEEN FREE EVER SINCE THEN TOO I HAD NO WORK AND MY WIFE TAUNTED ME WITH THAT
ROSA WHO WAS NOW EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WAS STUDYING IN THE CITY SHE WAS STILL THE SAME STUDIOUS FAITHFUL AND SINCERE IN ALL THAT SHE DID HER QUIET RESERVED MANNER CAUSED SOME PEOPLE TO CALL HER PROUD BUT THOSE WHO KNEW HER BETTER LOVED HER AND KNEW SHE COULD BE DEPENDED ON IN TIME OF TROUBLE
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN AND WHEN ONE HAS SERVED THE DEVIL AS MANY YEARS AS I HAVE
WERE TOO MUCH FOR ME AND HERE I BROKE DOWN COMPLETELY
MY FATHER HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO RECONCILE HIMSELF TO PRONOUNCE THE NAME OF MY MOTHER SINCE HER UNTIMELY DEATH IF
PAULA ENVELOPED HER IN HER STRONG ARMS I ALREADY LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART SHE SAID LAYING HER HEAD AGAINST CATALINA'S SHOULDER HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SICK PAULA SHE QUESTIONED HER NO BUT PAPA WAS
LISITA LOUIS TURNED TO SEE PAULA CALLING US FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN AND NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT CRIED LOUIS
CALLED MY FATHER ALL RIGHT I'M COMING SAID THAT GOOD LADY READ THIS AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF IT AND MY FATHER HANDED THE LETTER TO THE OLD SERVANT TERESA SEATED HERSELF AT THE END OF THE TABLE BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME
WHEN LOUIS RETURNED AT THE END OF THE WEEK HE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND PAULA SO HAPPY AND CONTENTED HE FOUND HER IN THE KITCHEN HELPING TERESA TO DRY THE DISHES ONE WOULD THINK SAID HE
BENDING HER GREAT FAT FORM MORE AND MORE CLOSELY OVER THE LETTER SHE BECAME MORE SERIOUS AS SHE NEARED THE BOTTOM OF THE FOURTH PAGE WHERE THE WRITING BECAME SO CLOSE AND SO FINE THAT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO DECIPHER IT
APPARENTLY HE HAD GONE OUT EARLY EACH DAY AND HAD RETURNED VERY LATE HE HAD BEEN THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECT OF OUR CONVERSATION AS EACH NIGHT WE CAME TOGETHER IN THE BIG WARM KITCHEN ON THOSE LONG WINTER EVENINGS
I CLOSED THE DOOR GENTLY BEHIND ME AND STOLE AWAY LATER PAULA SAID TO ME OH LISITA I'M SURELY BAD INDEED ONE THING I'VE CERTAINLY HATED TO DO AND THAT IS TO SIT DOWN AND LEARN TO SEW ESPECIALLY IN FINE WEATHER LIKE THIS
AT THIS PAULA SPRANG TO HER FEET AND PUT HER ARMS ABOUT THE POOR GIRL AND MURMURED IN HER EAR WE DO LOVE YOU SO MARGUERITE
SAID LOUIS HE HAD JUST STARTED A THRILLING NEW GAME OF JUMPING FROM A HIGH WALL I'LL TELL YOU WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO HOME NOW ARE YOU READY HURRY UP PAULA GET THE LADDER THERE IT IS UNDER THE CHERRY TREE
HE OF COURSE CONSIDERED THAT HE HAD THE RIGHT TO THE LAST WORD NOW KICKS HAD REPLACED WORDS BUT AS WE WERE SEATED AT QUITE A DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER
TO KEEP THEM FROM STRAYING INTO OUR NEIGHBOR'S PASTURES BUT I TELL YOU NOW WE PROMISED TERESA TO RETURN AT NINE O'CLOCK AND I'M NOT GOING TO DISOBEY HER THEN IT WAS THAT I JOINED IN ON THE SIDE OF LOUIS
AND I WANDERED UP AND DOWN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR SOMETHING TO DO UNFORTUNATELY EVERYBODY KNEW ME AND KNEW TOO MUCH ABOUT ME SO THERE WAS NO WORK FOR SUCH AS ME THEN SUDDENLY THE POOR THIN FACE WAS ILLUMINATED WITH A SMILE AS THE BRETON TRIUMPHANTLY SAID
HOW OLD ARE YOU PRAY I AM TEN YEARS OLD MADAME OH DON'T CALL ME MADAME CALL ME TERESA JUST AS YOUR MOTHER DID MANY YEARS AGO AND TERESA TOOK THE LAMP AND BROUGHT IT CLOSE TO PAULA NO
THEN TURNING TO US HE ADDED YOU NO DOUBT KNOW BY THIS TIME OF WHOM WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING YOUR COUSIN PAULA HAS JUST LOST HER FATHER
NOW SAID LOUIS WHAT TIME IT IS HALF PAST EIGHT ANSWERED PAULA LIFTING ASTONISHED EYES TO HER COUSIN'S FACE WELL IF IT'S HALF PAST EIGHT WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THERE WERE CASES FULL WINDOWS FULL COUNTERS FULL OF THE MOST EXQUISITE COMBS AND BRUSHES SOME WITH ELABORATE MONOGRAMS IN SILVER AND COLORS OTHERS PLAIN THERE WERE BOXES AND CASKETS OF EVERY SIZE AND SHAPE
AND IN A SURPRISINGLY SHORT TIME ALL WAS PRONOUNCED RIGHT THE BAGGAGE HAD PASSED
THEN A BOX OF QUININE PILLS THEN A SACHET FOR HER TRUNK THEN ANOTHER BURLESQUE POEM LAST OF ALL A CAKE OF DELICIOUS VIOLET SOAP TO WASH THE SEA SMELL FROM HER HANDS THE LABEL SAID
WHOSE TINKLE AND PLASH BLENDED AGREEABLY WITH THE RATTLE OF THE KNIVES AND FORKS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS A RAISED AND RAILED PLATFORM WHERE BEHIND A DESK SAT THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE BUSY WITH HER ACCOUNT BOOKS
MISSUS ASHE AND COUSIN HELEN HAD BOTH WARNED HER OF THE INCONVENIENT CONSEQUENCES OF WEIGHT IN BAGGAGE AND BY THEIR ADVICE SHE HAD LIMITED HERSELF TO A SINGLE TRUNK OF MODERATE SIZE BESIDES A LITTLE FLAT VALISE FOR USE IN HER STATEROOM CLOVER'S GIFT WAS A SET OF BLANK BOOKS FOR NOTES
AND HOB NOBBING WITH MICHAEL ANGELO AND THE CROWNED HEADS OF EUROPE I'LL MAKE THE SPICED PEACHES
FOR THE DINNER I ATE ON THE SHORE SO LATE HAS VANISHED INTO THE SEA LAUGHTER IS VERY RESTORATIVE AFTER THE FORLORNITY OF SEA SICKNESS AND KATY WAS SO STIMULATED BY HER LETTER THAT SHE MANAGED TO STRUGGLE INTO HER DRESSING GOWN AND SLIPPERS
IT'S A SAD KIND OF WORK FOR A MAN TO GO OFF FOR A TWENTY FOUR DAYS CRUISE LEAVING A SICK WIFE ON SHORE BEHIND HIM IF IT WASN'T THAT I HAVE LUCY TO LOOK AFTER THINGS I SHOULD HAVE THROWN UP MY COMMAND LONG AGO INDEED I AM GLAD YOU HAVE LUCY
AND TO BRING HOME AND FRIENDS A GREAT DEAL NEARER WITH A HALF HAPPY HALF TEARFUL PLEASURE KATY RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT DISTANCE COUNTS FOR LITTLE IF PEOPLE LOVE ONE ANOTHER
FOLLOWING A STAR IN THEIR CHOICE OF A HOTEL FOR HAVING NO BETTER ADVICE THEY HAD DECIDED UPON ONE OF THOSE THUS DISTINGUISHED IN BAEDEKER'S GUIDE BOOK THE STAR DID NOT BETRAY THEIR CONFIDENCE FOR THE
AMY HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AT LAST AND MUST NOT BE WAKED UP SO THEIR INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED IN WHISPERS MISSUS ASHE HAD BY NO MEANS GOT TO THE TEA AND TOAST STAGE YET AND WAS FEELING MISERABLE ENOUGH
WE WAKE UP SOME MORNING WITH NO IDEA THAT A GREAT HAPPINESS IS AT HAND AND BEFORE NIGHT IT HAS COME AND ALL THE WORLD IS CHANGED FOR US OR WE WAKE BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL WITH NEVER A GUESS THAT CLOUDS OF SORROW ARE LOWERING IN OUR SKY TO PUT ALL THE SUNSHINE OUT FOR A WHILE AND BEFORE NOON
AND SHE RESOLUTELY TURNED HER BACK ON THE IVORY ANGEL AND WALKED AWAY
DON'T WORRY ABOUT US WE SHALL GET ON HAPPILY AND EASILY IN FACT I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF I DEVELOPED SUCH A TURN FOR HOUSEKEEPING THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK THE FAMILY REFUSED TO CHANGE
DOCTOR CARR'S OBJECTIONS HIS RELUCTANCE TO PART WITH HER MELTED BEFORE THE RADIANCE OF HER SATISFACTION HE HAD NO IDEA THAT KATY WOULD CARE SO MUCH ABOUT IT AFTER ALL IT WAS A GREAT CHANCE PERHAPS THE ONLY ONE OF THE SORT THAT SHE WOULD EVER HAVE MISSUS ASHE COULD WELL AFFORD TO GIVE KATY THIS TREAT HE KNEW
FILLED HER WITH A SENSE OF DISMAYED SURPRISE GOOD GRACIOUS SHE SAID TO HERSELF EVEN THE BABIES UNDERSTAND IT SHE RACKED HER BRAINS TO RECALL WHAT SHE HAD ONCE KNOWN OF FRENCH
WHOM EVERYBODY ON BOARD RATHER PITIED THERE WAS THE OTHER GIRL ON HER WAY TO STUDY ART WHO WAS TRAVELLING QUITE ALONE AND SEEMED TO HAVE NOBODY TO MEET HER OR TO GO TO EXCEPT A FELLOW STUDENT OF HER OWN AGE ALREADY IN PARIS BUT WHO SEEMED QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF HER LONELY POSITION
THEN WE COULD CROSS OVER TO FRANCE AND VISIT PARIS AND A FEW OTHER PLACES AND BEFORE IT GETS COLD GO DOWN TO NICE AND FROM THERE TO ITALY KATY WOULD LIKE TO SEE ITALY DON'T YOU THINK SO I DARE SAY SHE WOULD SAID DOCTOR CARR WITH A SMILE SHE WOULD BE A QUEER GIRL IF SHE DIDN'T
LITTLE GRETCHEN HAS HAD TO GO WITHOUT ANYTHING AND SHE HAS BEEN SO GOOD AND PATIENT KATY LOST NO TIME BUT RAN FOR MISSUS BARRETT WHOSE INDIGNATION KNEW NO BOUNDS WHEN SHE HEARD HOW THE HELPLESS PARTY HAD BEEN NEGLECTED
AND COMPETENT TO GRAPPLE WITH ANYTHING OR ANYBODY THERE WAS THE QUEER OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD CROSSED ELEVEN TIMES BEFORE AND HAD ADVICE AND EXPERIENCE TO SPARE FOR ANY ONE WHO WOULD LISTEN TO THEM AND THE OTHER GENTLEMAN NOT SO OLD BUT EVEN MORE QUEER
WELL THERE'S ANOTHER VOYAGE OVER AND DONE WITH THANK GOD AND MY MARY IS WHERE SHE WAS IT'S A LOAD TAKEN FROM MY MIND THE MOON HAD RISEN AND WAS SHINING SOFTLY ON THE RIVER AS THE CROWDED TENDER LANDED THE PASSENGERS FROM THE SPARTACUS
THE VERY IDEA OF WHICH WAS SIMPLY DREADFUL AND PRONOUNCED THE OTHER LADY ORRIDLY ILL WORSE THAN YOU ARE MISS AND THE LITTLE GIRL
DOWN DOWN DOWN THE GREAT HULL WOULD SLIDE TILL KATY WOULD HOLD HER BREATH WITH FEAR LEST IT MIGHT NEVER RIGHT ITSELF AGAIN THEN SLOWLY SLOWLY THE TURN WOULD BE MADE AND UP UP UP IT WOULD GO TILL THE CANT ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS EQUALLY ALARMING
TO STAND IN FRONT OF SHOP WINDOWS FULL OF DELIGHTFUL THINGS AND NOT BE ABLE TO BUY ANY OF THEM SHE WAS ACCORDINGLY OVERPOWERED WITH SURPRISE GRATITUDE AND THE SENSE OF SUDDEN WEALTH WHEN ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE THE START HER FATHER GAVE HER THREE LITTLE THIN STRIPS OF PAPER WHICH HE TOLD HER WERE CIRCULAR NOTES
TO THE WAITERS EVEN WELL THERE IS ONE THING I AM GOING TO REFORM
BY POST CRIED KATY IN AMAZEMENT WHY HOW CAN THAT BE THEN CATCHING SIGHT OF ROSE'S HANDWRITING ON THE ENVELOPE SHE UNDERSTOOD AND SMILED AT HER OWN SIMPLICITY THE STEWARDESS BEAMED AT HER AS SHE OPENED IT THEN SAYING AGAIN
AND SEND ME A CUP OF TEA I DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE YOU ALONE KATY WAS BEGINNING BUT AT THAT MOMENT A NICE OLD WOMAN WHO SEEMED TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE WAITING ROOM APPEARED AND WITH A FLOOD OF FRENCH WHICH NONE OF THEM COULD FOLLOW
SHE FELT VERY SORRY FOR POOR LITTLE AMY RAGING THERE IN HER HIGH BERTH LIKE SOME IMPRISONED CREATURE BUT SHE WAS POWERLESS TO HELP HER SHE COULD ONLY RESIGN HERSELF TO HER OWN DISCOMFORTS AND TRY TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEHOW SOMETIME THIS STATE OF THINGS MUST MEND
I FEEL AS IF A CHANGE WOULD DO ME GOOD DON'T YOU THINK SO YOURSELF YES I DO DOCTOR CARR ADMITTED
IN FACT A GOOD MANY OF KATY'S PRESENTS HAD TO BE LEFT AT HOME INCLUDING A BRONZE PAPER WEIGHT IN THE SHAPE OF A GRIFFIN A LARGE PAIR OF BRASS SCREW CANDLESTICKS AND AN ORMOLU INKSTAND WITH A PEN REST ATTACHED WHICH WEIGHED AT LEAST A POUND AND A HALF THESE KATY LAID ASIDE TO ENJOY AFTER HER RETURN
GROWING BOLDER KATY VENTURED TO ASK A QUESTION OR TWO IN FRENCH AND WAS SURPRISED AND CHARMED TO FIND HERSELF UNDERSTOOD AFTER THAT SHE GREW ADVENTUROUS AND NO LONGER FEARFUL OF BEING LOST
OR TRY TO FANCY HOW YOU'LL FEEL THE FIRST TIME YOU STEP INTO A GONDOLA OR SEE THE MEDITERRANEAN THERE WILL BE A MOMENT I FEEL A FORTY HORSE POWER OF HOUSEKEEPING DEVELOPING WITHIN ME
THERE'S A SIGNAL WE'VE ARRANGED WHICH MEANS ALL'S WELL AND WHEN WE GET UP THE RIVER A LITTLE WAY I ALWAYS LOOK TO SEE IF IT'S FLYING IT'S A BIT OF A TOWEL HUNG FROM A PARTICULAR WINDOW AND WHEN I SEE IT I SAY TO MYSELF THANK GOD ANOTHER VOYAGE SAFELY DONE AND NO HARM COME OF IT
THEY WILL THINK THAT I AM MIRACULOUSLY IMPROVED BY ONE NIGHT ON FRENCH SOIL BUT NEVER MIND
CECY SENT A WONDERFUL OLD GOLD AND SCARLET CONTRIVANCE TO HANG ON THE WALL OF THE STATEROOM THERE WERE POCKETS FOR WATCHES AND POCKETS FOR MEDICINES AND POCKETS FOR HANDKERCHIEF AND HAIRPINS IN SHORT THERE WERE POCKETS FOR EVERYTHING
AND ENJOYED THE JOKE AS MUCH AS ANY ONE AS SHE PRESENTED HERSELF EACH DAY WITH THE INVARIABLE FORMULA A LETTER FOR YOU MA'AM OR A BUNDLE MISS COME BY THE PARCELS DELIVERY ON THE FOURTH MORNING IT WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF BABY ROSE IN A LITTLE FLAT MOROCCO CASE
HER FATHER ONLY LAUGHED
AND THAT HEARTS HAVE A TELEGRAPH OF THEIR OWN WHOSE MESSAGES ARE AS SURE AND SWIFT AS ANY OF THOSE SENT OVER THE MATERIAL LINES WHICH LINK CONTINENT TO CONTINENT AND SHORE WITH SHORE LATER IN THE MORNING
THE LITTLE GIRL DID NOT SEEM TO BE MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OLD SHE HAD TWO PIG TAILS OF THICK FLAXEN HAIR HANGING OVER HER SHOULDERS AND AT KATY'S APPROACH RAISED A PAIR OF SOLEMN BLUE EYES WHICH HAD SO MUCH APPEAL IN THEM THOUGH SHE SAID NOTHING
A PICTURE SO NEAR THE TRUTH THAT KATY FELT AS IF ROSE MUST HAVE THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY ESPECIALLY AS SHE KINDLY ILLUSTRATED THE SITUATION WITH A SERIES OF PEN AND INK DRAWINGS IN WHICH KATY WAS DEPICTED AS PRONE IN HER BERTH REFUSING WITH HORROR TO GO TO DINNER
THE SUN WAS STRUGGLING THROUGH THE FOG WITH A WATERY SMILE AND HIS FAINT BEAMS SHONE ON A CONFUSION OF STONE PIERS HIGHER THAN THE VESSEL'S DECK INTERSECTED WITH CANAL LIKE WATERWAYS
I WILL TALK IT OVER WITH KATY HE SAID THE CHILD OUGHT TO HAVE A SAY IN THE MATTER AND WHATEVER WE DECIDE YOU MUST LET ME THANK YOU IN HER NAME AS WELL AS MY OWN FOR YOUR GREAT KINDNESS IN PROPOSING IT
AND POLITICAL ECONOMY ALL COMBINED ONLY A GREAT DEAL MORE INTERESTING WE SHALL STICK OUT ALL OVER WITH KNOWLEDGE BEFORE YOU COME BACK AND THIS MAKES IT A PLAIN DUTY TO GO IF IT WERE ONLY FOR OUR SAKES WITH THESE ZEALOUS PROMISES KATY WAS FORCED TO BE CONTENT
AND SUCH A GOOD BREAKFAST AS WAS PRESENTLY BROUGHT TO THEM DELICIOUS COFFEE IN BOWL LIKE CUPS CRISP ROLLS AND RUSKS
THE WORST IS OVER WITH ALL OF US I HOPE THE VESSEL DOESN'T PITCH HALF SO MUCH NOW AND THE STEWARDESS SAYS WE SHALL FEEL A GREAT DEAL BETTER AS SOON AS WE GET ON DECK SHE IS COMING PRESENTLY TO HELP ME UP AND WHEN AMY WAKES WON'T YOU LET HER BE DRESSED
WHY HAD SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO WHAT WAS ALL EUROPE IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT SHE WAS LEAVING LIFE WAS SO SHORT HOW COULD SHE TAKE A WHOLE YEAR OUT OF IT TO SPEND AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE SHE LOVED BEST
THEN THE LEADING SHOE TURNED ON ITS HEEL AS IF GIVING A SIGNAL TO THE OTHERS AND THEY ALL HOPPED SLOWLY AGAIN INTO THE PASSAGE WAY AND DISAPPEARED IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE ONE OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN'S FAIRY TALES KATY WROTE TO CLOVER AFTERWARD
I THOUGHT I WAS NEVER GOING TO SEE YOU AGAIN SHE SAID WITH A LITTLE SQUEEZE OH MISS KATY IT HAS BEEN SO HORRID I NEVER THOUGHT THAT GOING TO EUROPE MEANT SUCH DREADFUL THINGS AS THIS THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
IS ONE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SQUADRON THEY WILL BE IN NAPLES BY AND BY AND IF WE WERE THERE AT THE SAME TIME WE SHOULD HAVE NED TO GO ABOUT WITH AND HE WOULD TAKE US TO THE RECEPTIONS ON THE FRIGATE AND ALL THAT WHICH WOULD BE A NICE CHANCE FOR KATY
BUT ROSE'S FORETHOUGHT HAD GONE SO FAR EVEN AS TO PROVIDE AN EXTRA PARCEL IN CASE THE VOYAGE WAS A DAY LONGER THAN USUAL AND MISS CARR'S MAIL CONTINUED TO COME IN TILL THE VERY LAST MORNING KATY NEVER FORGOT THE THRILL THAT WENT THROUGH HER WHEN AFTER SO MANY DAYS OF SEA
IF YOU WOULD GIVE MY LITTLE GIRL SOMETHING TO EAT SHE HAS HAD NOTHING SINCE YESTERDAY AND I HAVE BEEN SO ILL AND NO
BUT THERE WERE MISSUS ASHE AND AMY INCLINED TO BE HOMESICK ALSO AND IN NEED OF CHEERING AND KATY AS SHE TRIED TO BRIGHTEN THEM GRADUALLY GREW BRIGHT HERSELF AND RECOVERED HER HOPEFUL SPIRITS BURNET PULLED LESS STRONGLY AS IT GOT FARTHER AWAY
EITHER THEY SHOULD ALL GET TO LAND OR ALL GO TO THE BOTTOM AND BE DROWNED AND AT THAT MOMENT SHE DIDN'T CARE VERY MUCH WHICH IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE GALE INCREASED AS THE DAY WORE ON AND THE VESSEL PITCHED DREADFULLY TWICE KATY WAS THROWN OUT OF HER BERTH ON THE FLOOR
ABOUT A YEAR I THINK MY PLANS ARE RATHER VAGUE AS YET BUT MY IDEA WAS TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS IN SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND FIRST I HAVE SOME COUSINS IN LONDON WHO WILL BE GOOD TO US AND AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE MARRIED A GENTLEMAN WHO LIVES ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT PERHAPS WE MIGHT GO THERE
AND MISSUS ASHE WILL BE EVEN WORSE OFF I KNOW
MEANWHILE EVERY MORNING BROUGHT A FRESH SURPRISE FROM THAT DEAR PAINSTAKING ROSE WHO HAD EVIDENTLY WORKED HARD AND THOUGHT HARDER IN CONTRIVING PLEASURES FOR KATY'S FIRST VOYAGE AT SEA MISSUS BARRETT WAS ENLISTED IN THE PLOT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF THAT
DOCTOR I'M NOT KIND AT ALL AND I DON'T WANT TO BE THANKED MY DESIRE TO TAKE KATY WITH ME TO EUROPE IS PURELY SELFISH I AM A LONELY PERSON SHE WENT ON I HAVE NO MOTHER OR SISTER AND NO COUSINS OF MY OWN AGE MY BROTHER'S PROFESSION KEEPS HIM AT SEA I SCARCELY EVER SEE HIM
ORNAMENTS FANS PARASOL HANDLES LOOKING GLASSES FRAMES FOR PICTURES LARGE AND SMALL NAPKIN RINGS KATY WAS PARTICULARLY SMITTEN WITH A PAPER KNIFE IN THE FORM OF AN ANGEL
WHEN SHE WOKE THE SUN WAS STRUGGLING THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND SHE FELT BETTER THE STEWARDESS OPENED THE PORT HOLE TO FRESHEN THE AIR AND HELPED HER TO WASH HER FACE AND SMOOTH HER TANGLED HAIR THEN SHE PRODUCED A LITTLE BASIN OF GRUEL AND A TRIANGULAR BIT OF TOAST
OH CRIED KATY WITH HORROR NOTHING TO EAT SINCE YESTERDAY HOW DID IT HAPPEN EVERYBODY HAS BEEN SICK ON OUR SIDE THE SHIP EXPLAINED THE POOR LADY AND I SUPPOSE THE STEWARDESS THOUGHT AS I HAD A MAID WITH ME
THE TRAIN FOR PARIS MUST LONG SINCE HAVE STARTED AND KATY FELT DEJECTED AND FORLORN AS MAKING HER WAY OUT OF THE TERRIBLE LADIES' CABIN SHE CREPT ON DECK FOR HER FIRST GLIMPSE OF FRANCE
LET US HAVE A HANSOM I NEVER SAW ONE AND THEY LOOK SO NICE IN PUNCH SO A HANSOM CAB WAS CALLED THE TWO LADIES GOT IN AMY CUDDLED DOWN BETWEEN THEM THE FOLDING DOORS WERE SHUT OVER THEIR KNEES LIKE A LAP ROBE
BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME HAVE KATY DOCTOR CARR IT WILL SETTLE ALL MY DIFFICULTIES
YES M BY POST M'M WITHDREW AND LEFT KATY TO ENJOY THE LITTLE SURPRISE THE LETTER WAS NOT LONG BUT IT WAS VERY LIKE ITS WRITER ROSE DREW A PICTURE OF WHAT KATY WOULD PROBABLY BE DOING AT THE TIME IT REACHED HER
ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING SEEMED POSSIBLE TO SECURE IT FOR HER AND SHE MADE LIGHT OF ALL KATY'S MANY ANXIETIES AND APPREHENSIONS MY DEAR CHILD I KNOW A FLANNEL UNDERSHIRT WHEN I SEE ONE JUST AS WELL AS YOU DO SHE DECLARED TUCKS IN JOHNNIE'S DRESS FORSOOTH WHY OF COURSE
BEGAN TO EAT WITH A WILL AND KATY HERSELF FELT THAT IF THIS RAILROAD MEAL WAS A SPECIMEN OF WHAT THEY HAD TO EXPECT IN THE FUTURE THEY HAD INDEED COME TO A LAND OF PLENTY FORTIFIED WITH THE SATISFACTORY BREAKFAST
THAT IT WAS A FAVOR TO HER AS WELL AS TO KATY THIS TRAIN OF REASONING LED TO ITS NATURAL RESULTS DOCTOR CARR BEGAN TO WAVER IN HIS MIND BUT THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OVER KATY'S SECOND THOUGHTS WERE MORE SOBER ONES HOW COULD PAPA MANAGE WITHOUT HER FOR A WHOLE YEAR SHE ASKED HERSELF
AMID THE RUSH OF THE WIND THE CREAKING OF THE SHIP'S TIMBERS AND THE SHRILL BUZZ OF THE SCREW SHE HEARD A SOUND OF QUEER LITTLE FOOTSTEPS IN THE ENTRY OUTSIDE OF HER OPEN DOOR HOPPING AND LEAPING TOGETHER IN AN ODD IRREGULAR WAY LIKE A REGIMENT OF MICE OR TOY SOLDIERS
WHILE MISSUS ASHE AND AMY VISITED AN OLD AUNT IN HINGHAM TO SEE ROSE IN HER OWN HOME AND ROSE'S HUSBAND AND ROSE'S BABY WAS ONLY NEXT IN INTEREST TO SEEING EUROPE
THEN TOWARD SPRING I SHOULD LIKE TO GO TO FLORENCE AND VENICE AND VISIT THE ITALIAN LAKES AND SWITZERLAND IN THE EARLY SUMMER BUT ALL THIS DEPENDS ON YOUR LETTING KATY GO IF YOU DECIDE AGAINST IT I SHALL GIVE THE WHOLE THING UP
EVERY ONE OF WHICH WAS LIKELY TO BE DISCARDED AS SOON AS THE REAL JOURNEY BEGAN BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND IT MADE NO REAL DIFFERENCE SUCH SCHEMES ARE THE PRELIMINARY JOYS OF TRAVEL
THE NIGHT SEEMED ENDLESS FOR SHE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO SLEEP EXCEPT IN BROKEN SNATCHES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED AND SHE LOOKED THROUGH THE LITTLE ROUND PANE OF GLASS IN THE PORT HOLE ONLY GRAY SKY AND GRAY WELTERING WAVES AND FLYING SPRAY AND RAIN MET HER VIEW
ALL IS DARK NOTHING WHISPERS OF EITHER THE JOY OR THE GRIEF NO INSTINCT BIDS US TO DELAY OR TO HASTEN THE OPENING OF THE LETTER OR TELEGRAM OR THE LIFTING OF THE LATCH OF THE DOOR AT WHICH STANDS THE MESSENGER OF GOOD OR ILL
SHE MUST BE A GREAT COMFORT TO YOU SAID KATY SYMPATHETICALLY FOR THE CAPTAIN'S HEARTY VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE AS HE SPOKE SHE MADE HIM TELL HER THE COLOR OF LUCY'S HAIR AND EYES AND EXACTLY HOW TALL SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE HAD STUDIED AND WHAT SORT OF BOOKS SHE LIKED
IT CONTAINED A PRETTY LITTLE GREEN BOUND COPY OF EMERSON'S POEMS WITH KATY'S NAME AND TO BE READ AT SEA WRITTEN ON THE FLYLEAF SOMEHOW THE LITTLE GIFT SEEMED TO BRIDGE THE LONG MISTY DISTANCE WHICH STRETCHED BETWEEN THE VESSEL'S STERN AND BOSTON BAY
TO BE MADE OURS AS SOON AS WE HAVE CUT THE PAGES AND BEGUN TO READ NOTHING WHISPERED TO KATY CARR AS SHE SAT AT THE WINDOW MENDING A LONG RENT IN JOHNNIE'S SCHOOL COAT AND SAW MISSUS ASHE COME IN AT THE SIDE GATE AND RING THE OFFICE BELL THAT THE VISIT HAD ANY SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR HER
THE NEXT TURN BROUGHT THEM TO A GAY LOOKING LITTLE MARKET PLACE WHERE OLD WOMEN IN WHITE CAPS WERE SITTING ON THE GROUND BESIDE BASKETS AND PANNIERS FULL OF APPLES PEARS AND VARIOUS QUEER AND CURLY VEGETABLES NONE OF WHICH KATY RECOGNIZED AS FAMILIAR
I WILL LIE HERE ON THIS SOFA AND KATY DEAR
LONGWOOD SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH MY DEAREST CHILD YOUR NOTE MADE ME DANCE WITH DELIGHT
NOW DOCTOR CARR PLEASE PLEASE I AM SURE YOU WON'T DENY ME WHEN I HAVE SO SET MY HEART UPON HAVING HER MISSUS ASHE WAS VERY PRETTY AND PERSUASIVE BUT STILL DOCTOR CARR HESITATED
KATY WAS TO MAKE ROSE RED A VISIT ROSE HAD BY NO MEANS BEEN IDLE DURING THE THREE YEARS AND A HALF WHICH HAD ELAPSED SINCE THEY ALL PARTED AT HILLSOVER AND DURING WHICH THE GIRLS HAD NOT SEEN HER
INDEED CONTENTMENT WAS NOT DIFFICULT WITH SUCH A PROSPECT OF DELIGHT BEFORE HER WHEN ONCE HER LITTLE ANXIETIES HAD BEEN LAID ASIDE THE IDEA OF THE COMING JOURNEY GREW IN PLEASANTNESS EVERY MOMENT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT SHE AND PAPA AND THE CHILDREN PORED OVER MAPS AND MADE OUT SCHEMES FOR TRAVEL AND SIGHT SEEING
AND AS A GENERAL THING NONE OF THEM EVER SAW ANY OF THE OTHERS AGAIN IT IS OFTEN THUS WITH THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FELLOW VOYAGERS AT SEA AND IT IS ALWAYS A SURPRISE AND PERPLEXITY TO INEXPERIENCED TRAVELLERS THAT IT CAN BE SO
DOCTOR CARR WHO WAS SOFT HEARTED WHERE WOMEN WERE CONCERNED WAS TOUCHED PERHAPS HIS FACE SHOWED IT FOR MISSUS ASHE ADDED IN A MORE HOPEFUL TONE BUT I WON'T TEASE ANY MORE I KNOW YOU WILL NOT REFUSE ME UNLESS YOU THINK IT RIGHT AND NECESSARY AND SHE CONTINUED MISCHIEVOUSLY
SHE STOOD SO VERY STILL AND SAID SO VERY LITTLE THAT A BYSTANDER NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT HAVE DUBBED HER UNFEELING WHILE THE FACT WAS THAT SHE WAS FEELING TOO MUCH
HER MOTHER HAD BEEN WEAKLY NOW THIS LONG TIME BACK AND BESS AND NANNY WERE BUT CHILDREN YET SO LUCY HAD TO TAKE COMMAND AND KEEP THINGS SHIP SHAPE WHEN HE WAS AWAY SHE'LL BE ON THE LOOKOUT WHEN THE STEAMER COMES IN SAID THE CAPTAIN
BUT KEEPING AN EYE THE WHILE ON ALL THAT WENT FORWARD MISSUS ASHE WALKED PAST THIS PERSONAGE WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE OF HER AS AMERICANS ARE WONT TO DO UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES BUT PRESENTLY THE OBSERVANT KATY NOTICED THAT EVERY ONE ELSE
I NOTICED IT LAST NIGHT AND I LIKED IT SO MUCH THAT I MADE A RESOLUTION TO GET UP AND BE AS POLITE AS THE FRENCH THEMSELVES THIS MORNING
NOT A SAILOR UNDER HIM WOULD HAVE DARED DISPUTE HIS ORDERS FOR A MOMENT BUT HE WAS VERY POPULAR WITH THEM NOTWITHSTANDING THEY LIKED HIM AS MUCH AS THEY FEARED HIM FOR THEY KNEW HIM TO BE THEIR BEST FRIEND IF IT CAME TO SICKNESS OR TROUBLE WITH ANY OF THEM
MISSUS ASHE OFTEN DID COME TO THE OFFICE TO CONSULT DOCTOR CARR AMY MIGHT NOT BE QUITE WELL KATY THOUGHT OR THERE MIGHT BE A LETTER WITH SOMETHING ABOUT WALTER IN IT OR PERHAPS MATTERS HAD GONE WRONG AT THE HOUSE WHERE PAPERERS AND PAINTERS WERE STILL AT WORK
AND THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SO MUCH TO EACH OTHER FOR TEN DAYS CAN MELT AWAY INTO SPACE AND DISAPPEAR AS THOUGH THE BRIEF INTIMACY HAD NEVER EXISTED FOUR WHEELER OR HANSOM MA'AM SAID A PORTER TO MISSUS ASHE WHICH KATY OH
THROUGH WHOSE INTRICATE WINDINGS THE STEAMER WAS SLOWLY THREADING HER COURSE TO THE LANDING PLACE LOOKING UP KATY COULD SEE CROWDS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED TO WATCH THE BOAT COME IN WORKMEN PEASANTS WOMEN CHILDREN SOLDIERS
WHO HAD FROZEN HIS STOMACH EIGHT YEARS BEFORE BY INDULGING ON A HOT SUMMER'S DAY IN SIXTEEN SUCCESSIVE ICE CREAMS ALTERNATED WITH TEN GLASSES OF EQUALLY COLD SODA WATER AND WHO RELATED THIS EXCITING EXPERIENCE IN TURN TO EVERYBODY ON BOARD
AND JUST NOTICE HOW PRETTILY THESE LADIES AT THE NEXT TABLE SPEAK TO THE WAITER
HOW THEY ADD TO THE CHARM OF EVERYTHING SEEN AND ENHANCE THE EASE OF EVERYTHING DONE ALL BURNET TOOK AN INTEREST IN KATY'S PLANS AND ALMOST EVERYBODY HAD SOME SORT OF ADVICE OR HELP OR SOME LITTLE GIFT TO OFFER OLD MISSUS WORRETT WHO THOUGH FATTER THAN EVER STILL RETAINED THE POWER OF LOCOMOTION
AS THEY WENT BY BUT KATY WHO IS THAT PERSON WHY DO YOU SPEAK TO HER DON'T YOU SEE THAT THEY ALL DO SHE IS THE LANDLADY I THINK AT ALL EVENTS EVERYBODY BOWS TO HER
IT ENDED WITH THIS SHORT POEM OVER WHICH KATY LAUGHED TILL MISSUS ASHE CALLED FEEBLY ACROSS THE ENTRY TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER BREAK BREAK BREAK AND MIS BEHAVE O SEA AND I WISH THAT MY TONGUE COULD UTTER THE HATRED I FEEL FOR THEE
OH WELL FOR THE FISHERMAN'S CHILD ON THE SANDY BEACH AT HIS PLAY
THERE THE CAPTAIN FOUND HER AND DREW NEAR FOR A TALK CAPTAIN BRYCE WAS EXACTLY THE KIND OF SEA CAPTAIN THAT IS FOUND IN STORY BOOKS BUT NOT ALWAYS IN REAL LIFE HE WAS STOUT AND GRIZZLED AND BROWN AND KIND
SO SHE WENT CALMLY ON WITH HER DARNING DRAWING THE RAVELLING WITH WHICH HER NEEDLE WAS THREADED CAREFULLY IN AND OUT AND TAKING NICE EVEN STITCHES WITHOUT ONE PROPHETIC THRILL OR TREMOR WHILE IF ONLY SHE COULD HAVE LOOKED THROUGH THE TWO WALLS
THERE THEY WERE ELSIE CRYING TUMULTUOUSLY WITH HER HEAD ON PAPA'S COAT SLEEVE JOHN LAUGHING OR TRYING TO LAUGH WITH BIG TEARS RUNNING DOWN HER CHEEKS THE WHILE AND BRAVE LITTLE CLOVER WAVING HER HANDKERCHIEF ENCOURAGINGLY BUT WITH A VERY SOBER LOOK ON HER FACE
FOR MISSUS ASHE WAS ASKING PAPA TO LET HER DO THE VERY THING OF ALL OTHERS THAT SHE MOST LONGED TO DO
ON THE WHOLE KATY PREFERRED TO HAVE HER OWN SIDE OF THE SHIP THE DOWNWARD ONE FOR IT WAS LESS DIFFICULT TO KEEP HERSELF IN THE BERTH FROM WHICH SHE WAS IN CONTINUAL DANGER OF BEING THROWN
WHAT IS THE WORD FOR TRUNK KEY SHE ASKED HERSELF THEY WILL ALL BEGIN TO ASK QUESTIONS
LOOKING LONGINGLY BACKWARD TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE UNITED STATES WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AND FISHING OUT OF HER PORT HOLE WITH A CROOKED PIN IN HOPES OF GRAPPLING THE SUBMARINE CABLE AND SENDING A MESSAGE TO HER FAMILY TO COME OUT AT ONCE AND TAKE HER HOME
TO WHICH IT LED THEM PROVED TO BE QUAINT AND OLD AND VERY PLEASANT OF ASPECT THE LOFTY CHAMBERS WITH THEIR DIMLY FRESCOED CEILINGS AND BEDS CURTAINED WITH FADED PATCH
WHO CARRIED POOR LITTLE PALE AMY IN HIS ARMS AS EASILY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A KITTEN AMY GAVE A SCREAM OF JOY AT THE SIGHT OF KATY AND CUDDLED DOWN IN HER LAP UNDER THE WARM RUG WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF AND SATISFACTION
YES AND THAT IS WIDE ENOUGH AND LONG ENOUGH AND SOFT ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE REPLIED KATY I FEEL AS IF I COULD SLEEP FOR A FORTNIGHT TO MAKE UP FOR THE BAD NIGHTS AT SEA EVERYTHING SEEMED DELIGHTFUL TO HER THE SPACE FOR UNDRESSING
ALL DAY YESTERDAY WHEN SHE WASN'T SICK
IS SOMEWHAT QUEER AS YOU MIGHT KNOW MY HOUSE WOULD BE BUT I THINK YOU WILL LIKE IT I SAW SILVERY MARY THE OTHER DAY AND TOLD HER YOU WERE COMING SHE IS THE SAME MOUSE AS EVER I SHALL ASK HER AND SOME OF THE OTHER GIRLS TO COME OUT TO LUNCH ON ONE OF YOUR DAYS
PAPA I SHOULD THINK NOT CRIED KATY WITH UNSOPHISTICATED HORROR ONE VERY INTERESTING THING WAS TO HAPPEN BEFORE THEY SAILED THE THOUGHT OF WHICH HELPED BOTH KATY AND CLOVER THROUGH THE LAST HARD DAYS WHEN THE PREPARATIONS WERE NEARLY COMPLETE AND THE FAMILY HAD LEISURE TO FEEL DULL AND OUT OF SPIRITS
FIND OUT ABOUT SAINT CATHERINE OF SIENA
SHE IS ONLY TWENTY ONE HE REFLECTED HARDLY OUT OF CHILDHOOD I DON'T WANT HER TO SETTLE INTO AN ANXIOUS DRUDGING STATE AND LOSE HER YOUTH WITH CARING FOR US ALL SHE SHALL GO THOUGH HOW WE ARE TO MANAGE WITHOUT HER I DON'T SEE
IT SEEMED EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO LET HER GO AT MISSUS ASHE'S EXPENSE AT THE SAME TIME THE CHANCE WAS SUCH A GOOD ONE AND MISSUS ASHE SO MUCH IN EARNEST AND SO URGENT THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REFUSE POINT BLANK HE FINALLY CONSENTED TO TAKE TIME FOR CONSIDERATION BEFORE MAKING HIS DECISION
SHE KEPT HER RESOLUTION AND ASTONISHED MISSUS ASHE NEXT MORNING BY BOWING TO THE DAME ON THE PLATFORM IN THE MOST WINNING MANNER
IT GREW TO BE ONE OF THE LITTLE EXCITEMENTS OF SHIP LIFE TO WATCH FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THESE DAILY GIFTS AND WHAT DID THE MAIL BRING FOR YOU THIS TIME MISS CARR WAS A QUESTION FREQUENTLY ASKED EACH ARRIVAL KATY THOUGHT MUST BE THE FINAL ONE
CHAPTER FOUR ON THE SPARTACUS THE ULSTER AND THE FELT HAT SOON CAME OFF AGAIN FOR A HEAD WIND LAY WAITING IN THE OFFING
STEWED CHICKEN LITTLE PATS OF FRESHLY CHURNED BUTTER WITHOUT SALT SHAPED LIKE SHELLS AND TASTING LIKE SOLIDIFIED CREAM AND A POT OF SOME SORT OF NICE PRESERVE AMY MADE GREAT DELIGHTED EYES AT KATY AND REMARKING
AND SHE FELT HER HEART SINK WITHIN HER BUT AFTER ALL WHEN THE TIME CAME IT DID NOT PROVE SO VERY BAD KATY'S PLEASANT LOOKS AND COURTEOUS MANNER STOOD HER IN GOOD STEAD
I HAVE NO ONE BUT A COUPLE OF OLD AUNTS TOO FEEBLE IN HEALTH TO TRAVEL WITH ME OR TO BE COUNTED ON IN CASE OF ANY EMERGENCY YOU SEE I AM A REAL CASE FOR PITY MISSUS ASHE SPOKE GAYLY BUT HER BROWN EYES WERE DIM WITH TEARS AS SHE ENDED HER LITTLE APPEAL
AND OTHERS NOT SO PLEASANT PERHAPS WHO WERE RATHER CURIOUS AND INTERESTING TO WATCH KATY GREW TO FEEL AS IF SHE KNEW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER FELLOW TRAVELLERS AS TIME WENT ON THERE WAS THE YOUNG GIRL GOING OUT TO JOIN HER PARENTS UNDER THE CARE OF A SEVERE GOVERNESS
IN FACT SHE HAD MADE MORE OUT OF THE TIME THAN ANY OF THE REST OF THEM FOR SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS HAD BEEN MARRIED AND WAS NOW KEEPING HOUSE NEAR BOSTON WITH A LITTLE ROSE OF HER OWN WHO SHE WROTE TO CLOVER WAS A PERFECT ANGEL AND MORE DELICIOUS THAN WORDS COULD SAY
SHE WAS SICK TOO SAID AMY REGARDING THE DOLL IN HER ARMS WITH AN ANXIOUS AIR
IT WAS ALL LIKE A BAD DREAM AND THEY CALL THIS TRAVELLING FOR PLEASURE THOUGHT POOR KATY ONE DROLL THING HAPPENED IN THE COURSE OF THE SECOND NIGHT AT LEAST IT SEEMED DROLL AFTERWARD AT THE TIME KATY WAS TOO UNCOMFORTABLE TO ENJOY IT
THE LAST DAY CAME AS LAST DAYS WILL
THIS IS THE FIRST SHOP I HAVE BEEN INTO AND THE FIRST THING I HAVE REALLY WANTED TO BUY AND VERY LIKELY AS WE GO ON I SHALL SEE THINGS I LIKE BETTER AND WANT MORE SO IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO DO IT NO I WON'T
LONG HE STUDIED BEFORE HE MADE QUITE SURE THAT IT WAS THERE AT LAST HE SHUT THE GLASS WITH A SATISFIED AIR IT'S ALL RIGHT HE SAID TO KATY WHO STOOD NEAR ALMOST AS MUCH INTERESTED AS HE LUCY NEVER FORGETS BLESS HER
AND MANY COLORED GERANIUMS TWO BIRDS IN CAGES WERE SINGING LOUDLY THE FLOOR WAS WAXED TO A GLASS LIKE POLISH
THEY WILL BE THOSE OF DENISTON AND MYSELF DENISTON IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT HE IS GOOD AND HE IS PREPARED TO ADORE YOU THE BABY IS BOTH GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL AND YOU WILL ADORE HER I AM NEITHER BUT YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT ME AND I ALWAYS DID ADORE YOU AND ALWAYS SHALL
GOOD BY WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY KISSES TO CLOVY AND THE REST YOUR LOVING ROSE RED SHE NEVER SIGNS HERSELF BROWNE I OBSERVE SAID CLOVER AS SHE FINISHED THE LETTER OH ROSE RED BROWNE WOULD SOUND TOO FUNNY ROSE RED SHE MUST STAY TILL THE END OF THE CHAPTER
DON'T YOU WISH YOU WERE DEAD I DO AND THEN CAME ANOTHER STORM OF SOBS BUT NEVER A SOUND FROM MISSUS ASHE WHO KATY SUSPECTED WAS TOO ILL TO SPEAK
PERHAPS SHE HASN'T NOTICED IT AT ALL DEAR ME HOW GOOD SOMETHING SMELLS I WISH THEY WOULD BRING US SOMETHING TO EAT A GOOD MANY PASSENGERS HAD COME UP BY THIS TIME AND ROBERT THE DECK STEWARD WAS GOING ABOUT TRAY IN HAND TAKING ORDERS FOR LUNCH
THE GREAT TUB OF FRESH WATER WHICH STOOD BESIDE THE ENGLISH LOOKING WASHSTAND WITH ITS AMPLE BASIN AND EWER THE CHINTZ CURTAINED BED THE COOLNESS THE SILENCE AND SHE CLOSED HER EYES WITH THE PLEASANT THOUGHT IN HER MIND
THAT KATY STOPPED AT ONCE CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU SHE ASKED I AM AFRAID YOU HAVE BEEN VERY ILL AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE THE LADY ON THE SOFA OPENED HER EYES SHE TRIED TO SPEAK BUT TO KATY'S DISMAY BEGAN TO CRY INSTEAD
TO GO TO EUROPE FOR A YEAR WITH MISSUS ASHE AND AMY SEEMED SIMPLY TOO DELIGHTFUL TO BE TRUE
IT IS TOO ENCHANTING THE WHOLE OF IT I PUT IT AT THE HEAD OF ALL THE NICE THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED EXCEPT MY BABY WRITE THE MOMENT YOU GET THIS BY WHAT TRAIN YOU EXPECT TO REACH BOSTON AND WHEN YOU ROLL INTO THE STATION YOU WILL BEHOLD TWO FORMS ONE TALL AND STALWART THE OTHER SHORT AND FATSOME WAITING FOR YOU
MIGHT TO ALL APPEARANCES HAVE BEEN FURNISHED ABOUT THE TIME WHEN COLUMBUS CROSSED THE OCEAN BLUE BUT EVERYTHING WAS CLEAN AND HAD AN AIR OF OLD TIME RESPECTABILITY THE DINING ROOM WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY OF MORE MODERN BUILD
AND AWAY THEY DROVE UP THE SOLIDLY PAVED STREETS TO THE HOTEL WHERE THEY WERE TO PASS THE NIGHT IT WAS TOO LATE TO SEE OR DO ANYTHING BUT ENJOY THE SENSE OF BEING ON FIRM LAND ONCE MORE HOW LOVELY IT WILL BE TO SLEEP IN A BED THAT DOESN'T TIP OR ROLL FROM SIDE TO SIDE SAID MISSUS ASHE
NO OTHER NAME COULD SUIT HER HALF SO WELL AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HER BEING CALLED ANYTHING ELSE WHAT FUN IT WILL BE TO SEE HER AND LITTLE ROSE AND DENISTON BROWNE PUT IN CLOVER SOMEHOW I FIND IT RATHER HARD TO TAKE IN THE FACT THAT THERE IS A DENISTON BROWNE OBSERVED KATY
WHO HAD A GOOD DEAL TO SAY IN A VOICE MADE DISCREETLY LOW ABOUT WHAT A PITY IT WAS THAT DEAR MISSUS SO AND SO SHOULD DO THIS OR THAT AND DOESN'T IT STRIKE YOU AS VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE OTHER THING
IT WASN'T A BIT KIND OF YOU TO BRING ME TO SUCH A HORRID PLACE IT WAS VERY UNKIND IT WAS CRU EL I WANT TO GO BACK MAMMA TELL THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE ME BACK TO THE LAND MAMMA WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK TO ME OH I AM SO SICK AND SO VERY UN HAPPY
WITH WHOM SHE WAS A PRIME FAVORITE HE GAVE MISSUS ASHE AND HERSELF THE SEATS NEXT TO HIM AT TABLE LOOKED AFTER THEIR COMFORT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY AND EACH NIGHT AT DINNER SENT KATY ONE OF THE APPLE DUMPLINGS MADE SPECIALLY FOR HIM BY THE COOK
MOVING TO AND FRO AND ALL THIS CROWD WERE TALKING ALL AT ONCE AND ALL WERE TALKING FRENCH
AND EUROPE BECKONED MORE BRILLIANTLY NOW THAT THEY WERE FAIRLY EMBARKED ON THEIR JOURNEY
ONLY I KEEP THINKING OF POOR LITTLE MARIA MATILDA SHUT UP IN THE TRUNK IN THAT DARK PLACE AND WONDERING IF SHE'S SICK THERE'S NOBODY TO EXPLAIN TO HER DOWN THERE THEY SAY THAT YOU DON'T FEEL THE MOTION HALF SO MUCH IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP SAID KATY
WOULDN'T THAT BE FINE AND CLOVER LAUGHED MERRILY SO KATY DARLING CAST THAT SHADOW FROM YOUR BROW AND LOOK AS A GIRL OUGHT TO LOOK WHO'S GOING TO EUROPE WHY IF IT WERE I WHO WERE GOING I SHOULD SIMPLY STAND ON MY HEAD EVERY MOMENT OF THE TIME NOT A VERY CONVENIENT POSITION FOR PACKING SAID KATY SMILING
NEARER AND NEARER THEY CAME AND KATY OPENING HER EYES SAW A PROCESSION OF BOOTS AND SHOES OF ALL SIZES AND SHAPES WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN LEFT ON THE FLOORS OR AT THE DOORS OF VARIOUS STATEROOMS AND WHICH IN OBEDIENCE TO THE LURCHINGS OF THE VESSEL HAD COLLECTED IN THE CABIN
ON ONE SIDE IRELAND ON THE OTHER THE BOLD MOUNTAIN LINES OF THE WELSH COAST IT WAS LATE AFTERNOON WHEN THEY ENTERED THE MERSEY AND DUSK HAD FALLEN BEFORE THE CAPTAIN GOT OUT HIS GLASS TO LOOK FOR THE WHITE FLUTTERING SPECK IN HIS OWN WINDOW WHICH MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM
KATY GOING DOWN TO HER STATEROOM FOR SOMETHING CAME ACROSS A PALLID EXHAUSTED LOOKING LADY WHO LAY STRETCHED ON ONE OF THE LONG SOFAS IN THE CABIN WITH A BABY IN HER ARMS AND A LITTLE GIRL SITTING AT HER FEET QUITE STILL WITH A PAIR OF SMALL HANDS FOLDED IN HER LAP
BUT WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY SYMPATHETIC IN ITS NATURE FLEW AT MISSUS ASHE AND BEGAN TO MAKE HER COMFORTABLE FROM A CUPBOARD IN THE WALL SHE PRODUCED A PILLOW
SHE COULDN'T ANSWER SHE WAS TOO ILL EXPLAINED KATY WELL MY PET IT WAS PRETTY HARD FOR YOU I HOPE WE SHA'N'T HAVE ANY MORE SUCH DAYS THE SEA IS A GREAT DEAL SMOOTHER NOW MABEL LOOKS QUITE PALE
SHE KNEW OF COURSE THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WERE LIABLE TO BE FOUND SPEAKING THEIR OWN LANGUAGES BUT SOMEHOW THE SPECTACLE OF THE CHATTERING MULTITUDE
FISH OF ALL SHAPES AND COLORS WERE FLAPPING IN SHALLOW TUBS OF SEA WATER THERE WERE PILES OF STOCKINGS MUFFETEES AND COMFORTERS IN VIVID BLUE AND RED WORSTED AND COARSE POTTERY GLAZED IN BRIGHT PATTERNS
OF THIS FACT KATY SOON HAD AUDIBLE PROOF FOR AS HER DIZZY SENSES RALLIED A LITTLE SHE COULD HEAR AMY IN THE OPPOSITE STATEROOM CRYING AND SOBBING PITIFULLY SHE SEEMED TO BE ANGRY AS WELL AS SICK FOR SHE WAS SCOLDING HER POOR MOTHER IN THE MOST VEHEMENT FASHION
AND SEATED HER ON DECK IN A CHAIR WITH A GREAT RUG WRAPPED ABOUT HER FEET WITH VERY LITTLE EFFORT ON KATY'S PART THEN SHE DIVED DOWN THE COMPANION WAY AGAIN AND IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR APPEARED ESCORTING A BIG BURLY STEWARD
A CAKE OF SOAP AND A HAMMER AND TACKS TO NAIL THE WHOLE UP WITH MISSUS HALL'S GIFT WAS A WARM AND VERY PRETTY WOOLLEN WRAPPER OF DARK BLUE FLANNEL WITH A PAIR OF SOFT KNITTED SLIPPERS TO MATCH
OH DEAR WHY DO PEOPLE EVER GO TO SEA UNLESS THEY MUST SHE THOUGHT FEEBLY TO HERSELF SHE WANTED TO GET UP AND SEE HOW MISSUS ASHE HAD LIVED THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT THE ATTEMPT TO MOVE MADE HER SO MISERABLY ILL THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SINK AGAIN ON HER PILLOWS
RIPPING OUT A TUCK DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY SUPERHUMAN INGENUITY GIVE ME YOUR SCISSORS AND I'LL SHOW YOU AT ONCE QUINCE MARMALADE DEBBY CAN MAKE THAT HERS IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS YOURS AND IF IT WASN'T WHAT SHOULD WE CARE AS LONG AS YOU ARE ASCENDING MONT BLANC
THE FIFTH BROUGHT A WONDERFUL EPISTLE FULL OF STARTLING PIECES OF NEWS NONE OF THEM TRUE ON THE SIXTH APPEARED A LONG NARROW BOX CONTAINING A FOUNTAIN PEN THEN CAME MISTER HOWELLS'S A FOREGONE CONCLUSION WHICH KATY HAD NEVER SEEN
FROM COUSIN HELEN CAME A DELIGHTFUL TRAVELLING BAG LIGHT AND STRONG AT ONCE AND FITTED UP WITH ALL MANNER OF NICE LITTLE CONVENIENCES MISS INCHES SENT A HISTORY OF EUROPE IN FIVE FAT VOLUMES WHICH WAS SO HEAVY THAT IT HAD TO BE LEFT AT HOME
PEOPLE ALWAYS WISH THIS WHEN THEY ARE STARTING FOR EUROPE
WHICH WENT ON WITHOUT STOP OR STAY THOUGH CUSTOMERS DID NOT SEEM TO BE MANY AND SALES WERE FEW RETURNING TO THE STATION THEY FOUND THAT MISSUS ASHE HAD BEEN ASLEEP DURING THEIR ABSENCE
THE FACES OF THE WOMEN WERE BROWN AND WRINKLED THERE WERE NO PRETTY ONES AMONG THEM BUT THEIR BLACK EYES WERE FULL OF LIFE AND QUICKNESS AND THEIR FINGERS ONE AND ALL CLICKED WITH KNITTING NEEDLES AS THEIR TONGUES FLEW EQUALLY FAST IN THE CHATTER AND THE CHAFFER
AND THERE WILL BE FEES BUT PAPA PROTESTED KATY OPENING WIDE HER CANDID EYES I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO GIVE ME ANY MONEY AND I'M AFRAID YOU ARE GIVING ME TOO MUCH
AND WHAT THEY SAID AND HOW THEY FELT THE FIRST INSTALMENT OF THIS UN EXCITING ROMANCE WAS GIVEN THAT FIRST AFTERNOON ON DECK AND AFTER THAT AMY CLAIMED A NEW CHAPTER DAILY AND IT WAS A CHIEF INGREDIENT OF HER PLEASURE DURING THE VOYAGE
BUT WHICH IN REALITY LASTED MUCH LONGER IT MIGHT WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY HAVE BEEN CALLED THE ADVENTURES OF TWO LITTLE GIRLS WHO DIDN'T HAVE ANY ADVENTURES FOR NOTHING IN PARTICULAR HAPPENED TO EITHER VIOLET OR EMMA DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF THEIR LONG DRAWN OUT HISTORY
GRADUALLY THE DEAR FACES FADED INTO DISTANCE AND AFTER WATCHING TILL THE FLUTTER OF CLOVER'S HANDKERCHIEF BECAME AN UNDISTINGUISHABLE SPECK KATY WENT TO THE CABIN WITH A HEAVY HEART
AND BECAUSE IT MAY BE AND OFTEN IS HAPPY TIDINGS THAT COME AND JOYFUL THINGS WHICH HAPPEN EACH FRESH DAY AS IT DAWNS UPON US IS LIKE AN UNREAD STORY FULL OF POSSIBLE INTEREST AND ADVENTURE
AND WHEN THE WORDS CAME THEY WERE STRANGLED WITH SOBS
I LOVE MISSUS ASHE FOR INVITING YOU SO DO I SAID KATY SOBERLY IT WAS THE KINDEST THING I CAN'T THINK WHY SHE DID IT
WHO HAD GONE MANY VOYAGES WITH THE CAPTAIN AND KNEW HIS FANCIES KATY DID NOT CARE PARTICULARLY FOR THE DUMPLING BUT SHE VALUED IT AS A MARK OF REGARD AND ALWAYS ATE IT WHEN SHE COULD
AND KATY FOUND THAT HER APPETITE WAS COME AGAIN AND SHE COULD EAT AND ERE'S A LETTER MA'AM WHICH HAS COME FOR YOU BY POST THIS MORNING SAID THE NICE OLD STEWARDESS PRODUCING AN ENVELOPE FROM HER POCKET
THERE WERE MANY WINDOWS WITH BRIGHT POLISHED PANES AND VERY CLEAN SHORT MUSLIN CURTAINS AND ON THE WINDOW SILLS STOOD ROWS OF THRIFTY POTTED PLANTS IN FULL BLOOM MARIGOLDS BALSAMS NASTURTIUMS
WITH LONG SLENDER WINGS RAISED OVER ITS HEAD AND MEETING TO FORM A POINT ITS PRICE WAS TWENTY FRANCS AND SHE WAS STRONGLY TEMPTED TO BUY IT FOR CLOVER OR ROSE RED
HER EYES FIRST CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE DIM LINE OF THE IRISH COAST AN EXCITING AND INTERESTING DAY FOLLOWED AS AFTER STOPPING AT QUEENSTOWN TO LEAVE THE MAILS THEY SPED NORTHEASTWARD BETWEEN SHORES WHICH GREW MORE DISTINCT AND BEAUTIFUL WITH EVERY HOUR
THEY NOW SEEMED TO BE ACTING IN CONCERT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND REALLY LOOKED ALIVE AS THEY BUMPED AND TROTTED SIDE BY SIDE AND TWO BY TWO IN AT THE DOOR AND UP CLOSE TO HER BEDSIDE THERE THEY REMAINED FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS EXECUTING WHAT LOOKED LIKE A DANCE
WHICH FORTUNATELY WAS CLOSE AT HAND INQUIRY REVEALED THE FACT THAT NO TRAIN FOR PARIS LEFT TILL FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON I AM RATHER GLAD DECLARED POOR MISSUS ASHE FOR I FEEL TOO USED UP TO MOVE
BUT THIS HORRIBLE SHIP KEEPS ON AND IS NEVER A MOMENT STILL AND I YEARN FOR THE TOUCH OF THE NICE DRY LAND WHERE I NEEDN'T FEEL SO ILL BREAK BREAK BREAK THERE IS NO GOOD LEFT IN ME
AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF HER WHILE MISSUS BARRETT ATTENDS TO YOU I DON'T THINK I CAN BE DRESSED SIGHED POOR MISSUS ASHE
CHAPTER SIX ACROSS THE CHANNEL DAWN HAD GIVEN PLACE TO DAY AND DAY WAS WELL ADVANCED TOWARD NOON BEFORE THE STOUT LITTLE STEAMER GAINED HER PORT IT WAS HOURS AFTER THE USUAL TIME FOR ARRIVAL
HE NOW PROCEEDED TO PREPARE AND PASTE ON TWO SQUARE CARDS LABELLED RESPECTIVELY HOLD AND STATE ROOM MISSUS HALL HAD TOLD THEM THAT THIS WAS THE CORRECT THING TO DO
KATY AND HE GREW QUITE INTIMATE DURING THEIR LONG MORNING TALK THE CAPTAIN LIKED GIRLS HE HAD ONE OF HIS OWN ABOUT KATY'S AGE AND WAS FOND OF TALKING ABOUT HER LUCY WAS HIS MAINSTAY AT HOME HE TOLD KATY
SHE WENT ABOUT WITH SCRAPS OF PAPER IN HER POCKET ON WHICH WERE WRITTEN SUCH THINGS AS THESE FORUM WHEN BUILT BY WHOM BUILT MORE THAN ONE WHAT DOES CENACOLA MEAN
RICHARD MOWBRAY THOMAS DOLEMAN JAMES TOURVILLE
A PEDANTIC YOUNG CLERGYMAN
IF I CAN PROPERLY AVOID IT YOU KNOW WITH WHAT INDIFFERENCE SAID MY MOTHER SHE HAS HITHERTO SEEN HIM HER PRUDENCE MAY BE TRUSTED TO AS MY SISTER HERVEY SAYS WITH WHAT APPA
TO WHOM I DARE COMPLAIN UNHAPPILY CIRCUMSTANCED AS I AM IT IS BUT TOO PROBABLE THAT I SHALL COMPLAIN BECAUSE IT IS BUT TOO PROBABLY THAT I SHALL HAVE MORE AND MORE CAUSE GIVEN ME FOR COMPLAINT
HIS VANITY WOULD BE YOUR CLUE NEVER MAN HAD MORE YET AS MISSUS FORTESCUE OBSERVED NEVER DID MAN CARRY IT OFF SO HAPPILY THERE IS A STRANGE MIXTURE IN IT OF HUMOUROUS VIVACITY
BUT IF I AM TO BE ANSWERABLE FOR THE RASHNESS NO MORE NO MORE OF EITHER SIDE SAID MY FATHER YOU ARE NOT TO RECEIVE THE VISITS OF THAT LOVELACE THOUGH NOR ARE YOU SON JAMES
THAT THE INDISCREET VIOLENCE OF YOUR FRIENDS ON THE ONE HAND AND THE INSINUATING ADDRESS OF LOVELACE ON THE OTHER IF THE MAN BE NOT A GREATER FOOL THAN ANY BODY THINKS HIM WILL EFFECTUALLY BRING IT TO THIS AND DO ALL HIS WORK FOR HIM
I MUST OWN THAT I SHOULD THINK MYSELF INEXCUSABLE SO TO DO THE RATHER AS I AM BOLD ENOUGH TO IMAGINE IT A POINT OUT OF ALL DOUBT
THAT'S IT O MY FRIEND DID I NOT KNOW HOW MUCH YOU DESPISE PRUDERY
HIS ARM WAS IN A SLING HE OFTEN HAS THE MEAN ART TO LOOK UPON THAT WHEN ANY THING IS HINTED THAT MAY BE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TOWARD THE LEAST FAVOUR TO
WITH MISTER LOVELACE LET THE GIRL THEN I AM OFTEN THE GIRL WITH HIM BE PROHIBITED SEEING THAT VILE LIBERTINE NOBODY SPOKE
BUT RAVE AT YOUR STUPID PERSECUTORS AND THAT YOU DON'T LIKE
I SHOULD FOR BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO MIND TO BE HIS HOUSEKEEPER AND I AM SURE WERE I TO GO WITH HIM I SHOULD BE TREATED RATHER AS A SERVANT THAN A SISTER PERHAPS NOT THE BETTER BECAUSE I AM HIS SISTER
AND A VERY LIVELY IMAGINATION WHATEVER HIS OTHER VICES ARE
HE WILL NOT DISGRACE HIMSELF BY A COMPARISON SO ODIOUS HE APPEALS TO LORD M FOR THE REGULARITY OF HIS LIFE AND MANNERS EVER SINCE HE HAS MADE HIS ADDRESSES TO ME OR HAD HOPE OF MY FAVOUR
WRITERS WHOSE SUBJECTS AND CHARACTERS HAVE LESS WARRANTED THE LIBERTIES THEY HAVE TAKEN IN THE LETTERS OF THE TWO YOUNG LADIES IT IS PRESUMED
I HAD NOT ABSOLUTELY INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE AND TO WHOM I HAD REALLY GREAT OBJECTIONS FILLED AS HIS ARE WITH SUCH WARM PROTESTATIONS AND WRITTEN TO ME WITH A SPIRIT OF EXPECTATION FOR MY DEAR
I LONG FOR YOUR NEXT LETTER CONTINUE TO BE AS PARTICULAR AS POSSIBLE
PROPER TO BE BROUGHT HOME TO THE BREAST OF THE YOUTHFUL READER AS ALSO WITH AFFECTING CONVERSATIONS MANY OF THEM WRITTEN IN THE DIALOGUE OR DRAMATIC WAY MUCH MORE LIVELY AND AFFECTING
WICKED PEOPLE TO COMBINE AGAINST SO INNOCENT A MAN BUT AS I SAID LET US SEE WHAT THEIR NEXT STEP WILL BE AND WHAT COURSE YOU WILL TAKE UPON IT AND THEN WE MAY BE THE MORE ENLIGHTENED
YOU THEREFORE ARE NOT BUT BEFORE I PART ENTIRELY WITH THIS SUBJECT A WORD IN YOUR EAR MY CHARMING FRIEND
MAY BE THE VERY LAST AND THAT ONLY TO ACQUAINT ME WITH HIS ACQUIESCENCE THAT IT SHALL BE SO AT LEAST TILL HAPPIER TIMES THIS LAST I PUT IN THAT HE MAY NOT BE QUITE DESPERATE
TO MISS HOWE HARLOWE PLACE
SHALL WE NOT HAVE REASON TO COMMEND THE TENANT'S GRATEFUL HONESTY IF WE ARE TOLD THAT WITH JOY THE POOR MAN CALLED OUT YOUR UNCLE AND ON THE SPOT PAID HIM IN PART OF HIS DEBT THOSE TWO GUINEAS
AS FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD OF HIM BUT A FEW HOURS AGO
BUT YOUR FATHER THAT TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE NOT TO RECEIVE THE VISITS OF THAT LOVELACE COUSIN HARLOWE
I COULD BETTER ADVISE YOU WHAT TO DO THAN AT PRESENT I CAN YOU
US AN AMICABLE VISIT AS HE CALLS IT BUT WHICH I AM SURE CANNOT END AMICABLY THAT THEY SHOULD BOTH BE CONSULTED UPON THE PERMISSION I HAD DESIRED TO ATTEND YOU
YOU KNOW THAT I NEVER ABSENTED MYSELF
THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE BROUGHT TO THINK OF SUCH A MAN AS SOLMES
AS YOU AND I HAVE HEARD HIM SAY HE FREQUENTLY DOES THAT IS THE STRANGE THING
AND HALF DISJOINTS ONE'S ARMS TO REIN HIM IN AND WHEN YOU SEE HIS LETTERS YOU MUST FORM NO JUDGMENT UPON THEM TILL YOU HAVE READ MY ANSWERS IF YOU DO YOU WILL INDEED THINK YOU HAVE CAUSE TO ATTRIBUTE SELF DECEIT
HE IS FULL OF THE FAVOURS OF THE LADIES OF HIS FAMILY TO ME TO WHOM NEVERTHELESS I AM PERSONALLY A STRANGER EXCEPT THAT I ONCE SAW MISS PATTY MONTAGUE AT MISSUS KNOLLY'S
FREED FROM THE OBSERVANCE OF THOSE OTHER MORAL DUTIES WHICH BIND MAN TO MAN ON THE CONTRARY
THE MAN TOO SO LITTLE TO BE APPROVED OF FOR HIS MORALS IF
IN SHORT INTO A MERE LOVERLIKE CORRESPONDENCE WHICH MY HEART CONDEMNS IT IS EASY TO SEE IF I DO NOT BREAK IT OFF THAT MISTER LOVELACE'S ADVANTAGES BY REASON OF MY UNHAPPY SITUATION
BUT TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE TO THE FLIRTS OF HER SEX
THAT SHE IS NOT IN ALL RESPECTS A PERFECT CHARACTER IT WAS NOT ONLY NATURAL BUT IT WAS NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SOME FAULTS WERE IT ONLY TO SHOW THE READER HOW LAUDABLY SHE COULD MISTRUST AND BLAME HERSELF
HE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO SEE HER THERE SO WOULD SUCH AN IMPUDENT MAN HERE SAID MY UNCLE ANTONY AND TIS BETTER DONE THERE THAN HERE BETTER NO WHERE SAID MY FATHER
BE SO GOOD AS TO WATCH
YET IF I DO PUT AN END TO IT WITHOUT MAKING IT A CONDITION OF BEING FREED FROM MISTER SOLMES'S ADDRESS MAY I MY DEAR IS IT BEST TO CONTINUE IT A LITTLE LONGER IN ORDER TO EXTRICATE MYSELF OUT OF THE OTHER DIFFICULTY
HE HAD BEEN THE AGGRESSOR AND AS IF THE CATASTROPHE HAD BEEN AS FATAL AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF HE HAS A DESIGN BY THIS CONDUCT SOMETIMES COMPLAINING OF MY SHYNESS AT OTHERS EXALTING IN MY IMAGINARY FAVOURS
HE SPOKE OF THIS INDEED SHE SAYS WITH AN AIR OF PLEASANTRY FOR SHE OBSERVED AND SO HAVE WE THAT HE HAS THE ART OF ACKNOWLEDGING HIS VANITY
AND MAKING IT ONE OF THEIR WICKED MAXIMS TO KEEP NO FAITH WITH ANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS OF IT WHO ARE THROWN INTO THEIR POWER ARE NOT HOWEVER EITHER INFIDELS OR SCOFFERS NOR YET SUCH AS THINK THEMSELVES
AND THROBS AND GLOWS TO YOUR FRIEND AND YET AT OTHER TIMES THE CONTRADICTORY NATURE COMPLAINS THAT I SHEW HIM AS LITTLE FAVOUR AND MY FRIENDS AS MUCH
AS HAVE NOT ALLOWED YOU TO ATTEND TO THE THROBS OR IF YOU HAD THEM A LITTLE NOW AND THEN WHETHER HAVING HAD TWO ACCOUNTS TO PLACE THEM TO
THAT ALL HIS RELATIONS ARE AFRAID OF HIM
NOT THAT IT WOULD CONCERN ME SHOULD THEY ADVISE HIM TO THE CONTRARY BY MY LORD'S SIGNING MISTER LOVELACE'S FORMER LETTER BY MISTER LOVELACE'S ASSURANCES OF THE CONTINUED FAVOUR OF ALL HIS RELATIONS AND BY THE REPORT OF OTHERS
AND THE MORE SO AS NEITHER HIS LIFE NOR MORALS PERHAPS WOULD STAND A FAIR INQUIRY HE SMILED AND CALLED HIMSELF MY SERVANT THE OCCASION WAS TOO FAIR HE SAID FOR MISS HOWE WHO NEVER SPARED HIM TO LET IT PASS
HOW HAPPY I SHOULD BE TO BE TREATED WITH SO MUCH LENITY I SHOULD BLUSH TO HAVE MY MOTHER SAY THAT SHE BEGGED AND PRAYED ME AND ALL IN VAIN TO ENCOURAGE A MAN SO UNEXCEPTIONABLE AS MISTER HICKMAN
THAT HE IS PERPETUALLY REPROACHED FOR NOT RESENTING IT AND THAT AS WELL BY LORD M AND LADY SARAH AND LADY BETTY AS BY ALL HIS OTHER FRIENDS AND IF HE MUST HAVE NO HOPE FROM ME
FOR COMMON THINGS WHEN YOU COME WITH YOUR CURIOSITIES WITH YOUR CONDITIONAL LIKINGS AND WITH YOUR PRUDE ENCIES MIND HOW I SPELL THE WORD IN A CASE THAT WITH
OVER ACTS OF TREASON ALL THESE AGAINST THE SOVEREIGN FRIENDSHIP WE HAVE AVOWED TO EACH OTHER
THIS TOUCHES ME THE MORE SENSIBLY BECAUSE YOU YOURSELF MY DEAR ARE SO READY TO PERSUADE ME INTO IT I SHOULD BE VERY BLAMABLE
ANTONY HARLOWE THIRD BROTHER
BUT HERE IT WILL BE PROPER TO OBSERVE
AS THE PRIME OF YOUTH AND HIS NATURAL GAIETY WILL PERMIT AND BY HIS EARLY MORNING HOURS
THAT THESE PRESUMERS APPEAR NOT IN THIS VERY UNWORTHY LIGHT TO SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS IS BECAUSE THEIR DEFECTS ARE NOT SO STRIKING TO THEM AS TO OTHERS AND WHY SHALL I VENTURE TO TELL YOU
WILL YOU WONDER THEN THAT THE TIES OF RELATIONSHIP IN SUCH A CASE HAVE NO FORCE AND THAT A SISTER FORGETS TO BE A SISTER NOW I KNOW THIS TO BE HER SECRET MOTIVE THE MORE GRATING TO HER
BUT THIS APPLICATION HAS NOT MET WITH THE ATTENTION OF ONE SINGLE SOUL
INTO MY FATHER'S HANDS JUST NOW MY MOTHER HAS REJOICED ME WITH THE NEWS THAT MY REQUESTED PERMISSION IS GRANTED EVERY ONE THINKS IT BEST THAT I SHOULD GO TO YOU EXCEPT MY BROTHER
THAT YOU AND I MY DEAR SHOULD LOVE TO WRITE IS NO WONDER WE HAVE ALWAYS FROM THE TIME EACH COULD HOLD A PEN DELIGHTED IN EPISTOLARY CORRESPONDENCIES OUR EMPLOYMENTS ARE DOMESTIC AND SEDENTARY
THAT THEY VERY OFTEN MAKE SUCH REFLECTIONS UPON EACH OTHER AND EACH UPON HIMSELF AND HIS OWN ACTIONS AS REASONABLE BEINGS MUST MAKE WHO DISBELIEVE NOT A FUTURE STATE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AND WHO ONE DAY PROPOSE TO REFORM
FOR I THINK WITH ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF PERSON FORTUNE AND FAMILY HE IS NOT BY ANY MEANS WORTHY OF YOU AND THIS OPINION I GIVE AS WELL FROM THE REASONS YOU MENTION WHICH I CANNOT BUT CONFIRM
IF I HAVE DESERVED REFLECTION
OR BY MISTER HICKMAN WHO HAS SOME KNOWLEDGE OF LORD M COVERTLY HOWEVER WHAT THEIR OPINIONS ARE OF THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THINGS IN OUR FAMILY AND OF THE LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THERE IS THAT EVER THE ALLIANCE ONCE APPROVED OF BY THEM
HE IS ONE OF THE READIEST AND QUICKEST OF WRITERS HE MUST INDEED HAVE HAD EARLY A VERY DOCILE GENIUS SINCE A PERSON OF HIS PLEASURABLE TURN AND ACTIVE SPIRIT
O PRAY NOW AS YOU SAY NOW I HAVE MENTIONED THAT MY FELLOW WAS NOT SUCH A CHARMING FELLOW AS YOURS
THAT HE IS A COMPLETE MASTER OF SHORT HAND WRITING BY THE WAY WHAT INDUCEMENTS COULD A SWIFT WRITER AS HE HAVE TO LEARN SHORT HAND SHE SAYS AND WE KNOW IT AS WELL AS SHE
THAT THE MOMENT I HEAR HE VISITS ANY OF MY FRIENDS WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT I WILL MAKE A RESOLUTION NEVER TO SEE HIM MORE IF I CAN HELP IT I APPRIZE HIM
AND SUCH TYRANNICAL AND DESPOTIC WILLS IN OTHERS TO DEAL WITH INDEED ALL MAY BE DONE AND THE WORLD BE TAUGHT FURTHER TO ADMIRE YOU FOR YOUR BLIND DUTY AND WILL LESS RESIGNATION
THAT THEY DO NOT PUT IT TO ME
THUS ENDED THE CONFERENCE WILL YOU ENGAGE MY DEAR THAT THE HATED MAN SHALL NOT COME NEAR YOUR HOUSE BUT WHAT AN INCONSISTENCE IS THIS WHEN THEY CONSENT TO MY GOING
OF IT IN PRAISE OF THE POOR FELLOW'S HONESTY WERE THIS SO AND WERE NOT THAT LANDLORD RELATED TO MY DEAREST FRIEND HOW SHOULD I DESPISE SUCH A WRETCH BUT PERHAPS THE STORY IS AGGRAVATED
TO ENGAGE MY HONOUR TO HIM NEVER TO HAVE MISTER SOLMES I THINK I MAY FAIRLY PROMISE HIM THAT I WILL NOT HE BEGS
MY CONFINEMENT HANNA'S DISMISSION AND MORE OF THE RESENTMENTS AND RESOLUTIONS OF MY FATHER UNCLES AND BROTHER THAN I CAN POSSIBLY KNOW AND ALMOST AS SOON AS THE THINGS HAPPEN WHICH HE TELLS ME OF
IF HER MEEKNESS SHOULD NOT BE REWARDED IS THE WANT OF REWARD OR THE WANT EVEN OF A GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT A REASON FOR US TO DISPENSE WITH WHAT WE THINK OUR DUTY THEY WERE MY FATHER'S LIVELY SPIRITS THAT FIRST MADE HIM
HE IS A SOBER MAN AND AMONG ALL HIS BAD QUALITIES GAMING THAT GREAT WASTER OF TIME AS WELL AS FORTUNE IS NOT HIS VICE SO THAT HE MUST HAVE HIS HEAD AS COOL AND HIS REASON AS CLEAR
AS TO THE ADVICE YOU GIVE TO RESUME MY ESTATE I AM DETERMINED NOT TO LITIGATE WITH MY FATHER LET WHAT WILL BE THE CONSEQUENCE TO MYSELF I MAY GIVE YOU AT ANOTHER TIME
YOU MIGHT HAVE HELPED ME TO A PHRASE
IF YOU WOULD INGENUOUSLY OWN OWN WHAT YOU'LL SAY WHY MY ANNA HOWE I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK THAT I AM ALREADY IN LOVE NO TO BE SURE HOW CAN YOUR ANNA HOWE HAVE SUCH A THOUGHT WHAT THEN SHALL WE CALL IT
WHO LIKE HIM HAVE NEVER KNOWN WHAT IT WAS TO BE CONTROULED HE HAD ONCE IT SEEMS THE VANITY UPON BEING COMPLIMENTED ON THESE TALENTS AND ON HIS SURPRISING DILIGENCE FOR A MAN OF PLEASURE TO COMPARE HIMSELF TO JULIUS CAESAR
BUT THESE FOUR LADIES OF HIS FAMILY HAVE SUCH EXCELLENT CHARACTERS THAT ONE CANNOT BUT WISH TO BE THOUGHT WELL OF BY THEM CANNOT THERE BE A WAY TO FIND OUT
AN INTEREST IN HER GENTLE BOSOM THEY WERE THE SAME SPIRITS TURNED INWARD AS I HAVE HERETOFORE OBSERVED THAT MADE HIM SO IMPATIENT WHEN THE CRUEL MALADY SEIZED HIM HE ALWAYS LOVED MY MOTHER
THAT IN THE GREAT CORRESPONDENCE BY LETTERS WHICH HE HOLDS HE IS AS SECRET AND AS CAREFUL AS IF IT WERE OF A TREASONABLE NATURE YET TROUBLES NOT HIS HEAD WITH POLITICS THOUGH NOBODY KNOWS THE INTERESTS OF PRINCES AND COURTS BETTER THAN HE IS SAID TO DO
BEING VERILY PERSUADED THAT ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WOULD HAVE YIELDED BY THIS TIME AND THEN I SHOULD HAVE HAD SOME DEGREE OF CERTAINTY TO FOUND MY OBSERVATIONS UPON AND INDEED WHAT CAN I WRITE
SPARE ME NOT THEREFORE MY DEAR FRIEND WHENEVER YOU THINK ME IN THE LEAST FAULTY I LOVE YOUR AGREEABLE RAILLERY YOU KNOW I ALWAYS DID NOR HOWEVER OVER SERIOUS YOU THINK ME DID I EVER THINK YOU FLIPPANT
THAT LOVELACE HIMSELF WOULD HARDLY THINK ME WORTH ADDRESSING WERE HE TO KNOW THIS WOULD BE MY RESOLUTION THESE MEN MY DEAR
I KNOW NOT WHAT TO MAKE OF THE ANSWER BROUGHT TO MY REQUEST OF BEING PERMITTED TO GO TO CHURCH THIS AFTERNOON IF YOU DESIGNED TO SHEW YOUR PLEASANTRY BY IT I HOPE THAT WILL CONTINUE AND THEN MY REQUEST WILL BE GRANTED
SUCH STROKES OF GAYETY FANCY AND HUMOUR AS WILL ENTERTAIN AND DIVERT AND AT THE SAME TIME BOTH WARN AND INSTRUCT ALL THE LETTERS ARE WRITTEN WHILE THE HEARTS OF THE WRITERS MUST BE SUPPOSED TO BE WHOLLY ENGAGED IN THEIR SUBJECTS
I SUPPOSE HE WOULD HAVE HIS LORDSHIP'S SIGNING TO THIS LETTER TO BE TAKEN AS A VOUCHER FOR HIM HE DESIRES MY LEAVE IN COMPANY WITH MY LORD IN A PACIFIC MANNER
MISTER LOVELACE IS A VERY FAULTY MAN YOU AND I HAVE THOUGHT HIM TOO GAY TOO INCONSIDERATE TOO RASH
I COMMAND YOU TURNING TO ME ON PAIN OF DISPLEASURE THAT YOU SEE HIM NOT AT ALL I WILL NOT SIR IN ANY WAY OF ENCOURAGEMENT I DO ASSURE YOU NOT AT ALL
THAT VANITY IS A STOP SHORT PRIDE IN SUCH A ONE THAT WOULD MAKE ONE JUSTLY DOUBT THE WORTHINESS OF HIS INTERIOR YOU OUR PATTERN SO LOVELY IN FEATURE SO GRACEFUL IN PERSON HAVE NONE OF IT
TO WHOM THEY HAVE NOW SO GREAT AN ANTIPATHY AND INDEED COULD I BE AS EASY AND HAPPY HERE AS I USED TO BE I WOULD DEFY THAT MAN AND ALL HIS SEX AND NEVER REPENT THAT I HAVE GIVEN THE POWER OF MY FORTUNE
WHICH IS DUE TO VANITY AND SELF OPINION AND AT THE SAME TIME HALF PERSUADES THOSE WHO HEAR HIM THAT HE REALLY DESERVES THE EXULTATION HE GIVES HIMSELF BUT SUPPOSING IT TO BE TRUE THAT ALL HIS VACANT NIGHTLY HOURS ARE EMPLOYED IN WRITING
THERE MAY POSSIBLY BE SOMETHING IN IT BUT WHETHER THERE BE OR NOT WHENEVER I AM COOL AND GIVE MYSELF TIME TO REFLECT I WILL LOVE YOU THE BETTER FOR THE CORRECTION YOU GIVE BE AS SEVERE AS YOU WILL UPON ME
EVER HAD SO LITTLE FAVOUR FROM A WOMAN FOR WHOSE SAKE HE HAD BORNE SO MUCH I TOLD HIM MY MIND AS FREELY AS I USED TO DO BUT WHOEVER WAS IN FAULT
HAUGHTY AS IT CERTAINLY IS
IT IS NATURAL I BELIEVE FOR A PERSON TO BE THE MORE DESIROUS OF MAKING NEW FRIENDS
BUT TO YOU WHAT AN INEXCUSABLE PRESUMPTION YET I AM AFRAID ALL OPPOSITION WILL BE IN VAIN YOU MUST YOU WILL I DOUBT BE SACRIFICED TO THIS ODIOUS MAN I KNOW YOUR FAMILY
BUT LORD M BEING INCLINED RATHER TO SUPPORT THAN TO BLAME HIS NEPHEW
NOTWITHSTANDING YOUR QUESTIONABLE THROBS EVEN WERE THE MERITS OF MISTER LOVELACE MUCH GREATER THAN THEY ARE I HAVE ANSWERED HIS LETTERS IF HE TAKES ME AT MY WORD
AS SHE WOULD HAVE IT TO BE TOLD IT TO ONE OF HER CONFIDANTS
HE CANNOT COME AT THESE INTELLIGENCIES FAIRLY HE IS EXCESSIVELY UNEASY UPON WHAT HE HEARS AND HIS EXPRESSIONS BOTH OF LOVE TO ME AND RESENTMENT TO THEM ARE VERY FERVENT HE SOLICITS ME
WHO HAPPENED TO BE BORN THIRTY YEARS BEFORE ONE OF YOUR UNCLES I SPEAK
HE WILL NOT SCRUPLE TO BE GUILTY OF WHENEVER HE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY UPON THE WHOLE
AND FOR HER DRIVING ON FOR A FIXED DAY FOR SACRIFICING YOU TO SOLMES IN SHORT FOR HER RUDENESS AND VIOLENCE OF EVERY KIND WHAT A SWEET REVENGE WILL SHE TAKE AS WELL UPON LOVELACE AS UPON YOU
THE INTENTION IS I TELL YOU PLAINLY TO MORTIFY YOU INTO A SENSE OF YOUR DUTY THE NEIGHBOURS YOU ARE SO SOLICITOUS TO APPEAR WELL WITH ALREADY KNOW THAT YOU DEFY THAT SO MISS
OTHERS BUT THAT SUCH A GAY LIVELY YOUNG FELLOW AS THIS WHO RIDES HUNTS TRAVELS
AND HAVING IT AS MUCH IN THEIR POWER AS IN THEIR WILL TO MISREPRESENT ALL YOU SAY ALL YOU DO SUCH SUBJECT
WRINGS THE HEART BUT IT GOES AGAINST ONE TO HEAR ANY BODY ELSE TAKE THE SAME LIBERTIES THEN YOU HAVE SO VERY STRONG A MANNER OF EXPRESSION WHERE YOU TAKE A DISTASTE THAT WHEN PASSION HAS SUBDUED AND I COME
CAN SATISFY MY LOVE AND MY FRIENDSHIP SURELY YOU ARE NOT AFRAID TO TRUST YOURSELF WITH A SECRET OF THIS NATURE IF YOU ARE THEN YOU MAY THE MORE ALLOWABLY DOUBT ME BUT I DARE SAY
BUT BE IT YOUR PART IF I DO TO SOOTH MY ANGRY PASSIONS AND TO SOFTEN MY RESENTMENTS AND THIS THE RATHER AS YOU KNOW WHAT AN INFLUENCE YOUR ADVICE HAS UPON ME AND AS YOU MUST ALSO KNOW
RETURN THE COMPLIMENTS OF ANY OF MY ACQUAINTANCES MY DISGRACES IF THEY ARE TO HAVE AN END NEED NOT BE PROCLAIMED TO THE WHOLE WORLD I ASK THIS FAVOUR THEREFORE FOR MY REPUTATION'S SAKE
HAS PUT IT TO MY MOTHER WHETHER IT WERE NOT BEST TO PREVAIL UPON MY BROTHER TO TAKE A TURN TO HIS YORKSHIRE ESTATE WHICH HE WAS INTENDING TO DO BEFORE
SHE BELIEVES HE IS CLEAR OF THE WORLD AND THAT HE WILL CONTINUE SO
HER DAUGHTER MISSUS JUDITH NORTON A WOMAN OF GREAT PIETY AND DISCRETION WHO HAD A PRINCIPAL SHARE IN THE EDUCATION OF CLARISSA COL WM MORDEN A NEAR RELATION OF THE HARLOWES
MISS HOWE TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY MORNING MARCH SECOND INDEED YOU WOULD NOT BE IN LOVE WITH HIM FOR THE WORLD YOUR SERVANT MY DEAR NOR WOULD I HAVE YOU
O THE FOND FOND HEART WITH A SNEER OF INSULT LIFTING UP HIS HANDS SIR SAID I TO MY FATHER TO YOUR JUSTICE I APPEAL
ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT MY COUSIN CLARY'S PRUDENCE MAY BE CONFIDED IN I AM CONVINCED IT MAY JOINED MY MOTHER BUT AUNT BUT MADAM PUT IN MY SISTER
MUCH AGAINST MY LIKING I ASSURE YOU SAID MY BROTHER RUDELY INTERRUPTING HER SON JAMES SAID MY FATHER AND KNIT HIS BROWS
AS HE IS IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH US HIS WRITINGS ARE NOT PROBABLY SUCH AS WOULD REDOUND EITHER TO HIS OWN HONOUR OR TO THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS WERE THEY TO BE READ HE MUST BE CONSCIOUS OF THIS
AND HENCE SIR RETORTED I YOUR UNBROTHERLY REFLECTIONS UPON ME WELL BUT YOU OBSERVE MISS SAID HE
AS HER PRIDE IS CONCERNED TO MAKE HER DISAVOW IT
TO APOLOGIZE TO ME FOR THAT CHANGE OF STYLE TO THEM AND TILL YOU WILL SPEAK OUT LIKE A FRIEND TO HER UNQUESTIONABLE FRIEND I MUST TEASE YOU A LITTLE LET IT RUN THEREFORE FOR IT WILL RUN IF THEN
TO KEEP IN YOUR OWN HANDS THE ESTATE BEQUEATHED TO YOU BY YOUR GRANDFATHER HAD YOU DONE SO IT WOULD HAVE PROCURED YOU AT LEAST AN OUTWARD RESPECT FROM YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THEM CONCEAL THE ENVY AND ILL WILL
MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE FRIDAY MARCH TENTH YOU WILL PERMIT ME MY DEAR TO TOUCH UPON A FEW PASSAGES IN YOUR LAST LETTER THAT AFFECT ME SENSIBLY
AND THAT I AM IN DIRECT TREATY WITH HIM OR THAT HE IS SURE THAT MY FRIENDS WILL DRIVE ME INTO A FOREIGN PROTECTION FOR HE HAS THE BOLDNESS TO OFFER IN MY LORD'S NAME AN ASYLUM TO ME
PRESERVES A DECENCY AS WELL IN HIS IMAGES AS IN HIS LANGUAGE
I SUPPOSE IT IS THE WAY OF THIS SEX TO ENDEAVOUR TO ENTANGLE THE THOUGHTLESS OF OURS BY BOLD SUPPOSALS AND OFFERS IN HOPES THAT WE SHALL BE TOO COMPLAISANT OR BASHFUL TO QUARREL WITH THEM
I GAVE THE MESSENGER A BILLET IN WHICH I MADE IT MY HUMBLE REQUEST THROUGH HIM TO MY FATHER TO BE PERMITTED TO GO TO CHURCH THIS AFTERNOON THIS WAS THE CONTEMPTUOUS ANSWER
THAT IS INDEED INDISPENSABLE IN FRIENDSHIP I KNEW YOUR MOTHER WOULD BE FOR IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE IN A CHILD I AM SORRY MY CASE IS SO CIRCUMSTANCED THAT I CANNOT COMPLY IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO DO SO IF I COULD
BUT WHAT SHALL WE SAY OF THAT LANDLORD WHO THOUGH HE KNEW THE POOR MAN TO BE QUITE DESTITUTE COULD TAKE IT AND SAYING NOTHING WHILE MISTER LOVELACE STAID AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE TELL
TO WHAT YOU THINK IT OWING THAT YOUR MAN SEEMS SO CAREFUL TO ADORN THAT SELF ADORNED PERSON OF HIS YET SO MANAGES THAT ONE CANNOT FOR ONE'S HEART THINK HIM A COXCOMB
BECAUSE HAVING RELIEVED HER AS SHE IS PLEASED TO SAY OF THE HOUSEHOLD CARES FOR WHICH MY SISTER YOU KNOW HAS NO TURN THEY MUST AGAIN DEVOLVE UPON HER IF I GO AND IF SHE DID NOT OPPOSE IT
AS TO YOUR CHANGE OF STYLE TO YOUR UNCLES AND BROTHER AND SISTER SINCE THEY WERE SO FOND OF ATTRIBUTING TO YOU A REGARD FOR LOVELACE AND WOULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO THE CONTRARY AND SINCE YOU ONLY STRENGTHENED THEIR ARGUMENTS AGAINST YOURSELF BY DENYING IT
TO CALL IT BETTY PLEASED TO BE THOUGHT WORTHY OF A SECRET
THE BETTER FOR YOUR FRIENDLY FREEDOM BUT METHINKS I COULD BE GLAD THAT YOU WOULD NOT LET THIS IMPUTATION PASS SO GLIBLY FROM YOUR PEN OR YOUR LIPS AS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ONE OF YOUR OWN SEX WHETHER I BE THE PERSON OR NOT
I HAVE ANOTHER LETTER FROM MISTER LOVELACE ALTHOUGH I HAD NOT ANSWERED HIS FORMER THIS MAN SOMEHOW OR OTHER KNOWS EVERY THING THAT PASSES IN OUR FAMILY
AND TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THIS CONCESSION IN FORM YOU KNOW MY DEAR THAT THERE IS A
AN ADMIRER OF MISS HOWE LORD M UNCLE TO MISTER LOVELACE
OUGHT TO BE SACRED BUT SHOULD NOT PARENTS HAVE REASON FOR WHAT THEY DO WONDER NOT HOWEVER AT YOUR BELL'S UNSISTERLY BEHAVIOUR IN THIS AFFAIR
IN SHORT MY DEAR I HAVE KNOWN YOU IN MORE INSTANCES THAN ONE SIT DOWN RESOLVED TO WRITE ALL THAT WIT RATHER THAN STRICT JUSTICE COULD SUGGEST UPON THE GIVEN OCCASION PERHAPS IT MAY BE THOUGHT
THAT NOW ARE BURSTING UPON YOU FROM HEARTS SO NARROW I MUST HARP A LITTLE MORE UPON THIS STRING
SHE TOLD THE WENCH IN STRICT CONFIDENCE AND THUS BY WAY OF THE FEMALE ROUND ABOUT AS LOVELACE
AND BUT YESTERDAY HE MENTIONED ONE WHO HAS APPLIED TO HIM BY LETTER MAKING HIGH OFFERS THIS IS MISTER SOLMES RICH SOLMES YOU KNOW THEY CALL HIM
AND THOSE WITH WHOM SHE WAS INSEPARABLY CONNECTED SHE IS PERFECT TO HAVE BEEN IMPECCABLE MUST HAVE LEFT NOTHING FOR THE DIVINE GRACE AND A PURIFIED STATE TO DO
ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS CONFIRMING HIS LOVE OF WRITING HAS TOLD HER THAT HIS THOUGHTS FLOW RAPIDLY TO HIS PEN AND YOU AND I MY DEAR HAVE OBSERVED ON MORE OCCASIONS THAN ONE
SO THAT THEY ARE ADVISED WITH UPON EVERY ARTICLE RELATING TO US OR THAT MAY AFFECT US IT IS THEREFORE THE LESS WONDER AT A TIME WHEN THEY UNDERSTAND THAT MISTER LOVELACE IS DETERMINED TO PAY
INDEED IT IS FIT THEY SHOULD FOR LOVE MUST BE A VERY FOOLISH THING TO LOOK BACK UPON
AND IS BUT JUST GONE AWAY HE IS ALL IMPATIENCE AND RESENTMENT AT THE TREATMENT YOU MEET WITH AND FULL OF APPREHENSIONS TOO THAT THEY WILL CARRY THEIR POINT WITH YOU
AS TO HIS POWER OVER ME NAY MORE BUT STILL MORE TO YOURS
TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WITH HOPE OR WITH ANY THING BUT WISHES THUS THE BOLD AND FORWARD NOT BEING SENSIBLE OF THEIR DEFECTS ASPIRE WHILE THE MODESTY OF THE REALLY WORTHY
THAT YOU WON'T DO YOU CANNOT BEAR THE THOUGHTS OF HAVING THEIR SOLMES AND LOVELACE IS RESOLVED YOU SHALL BE HIS
HOW MUCH YOUR BROTHER'S INFLUENCE HAS OVERTOPPED YOURS SINCE HE HAS GOT INTO FORTUNES SO CONSIDERABLE AND SINCE YOU HAVE GIVEN SOME OF THEM AN APPETITE TO CONTINUE IN THEMSELVES THE POSSESSION OF YOUR ESTATE UNLESS YOU COMPLY WITH THEIR TERMS
TO WHOSE LOT HE SHALL FALL TILL THEN WOMEN I SHOULD SAY PERHAPS SINCE HE MAY BREAK HALF A DOZEN HEARTS BEFORE THAT TIME BUT TO THE POINT I WAS UPON
INDEED IT WILL NOT AND YET IT IS BUT THE BEGINNING I SUPPOSE OF WHAT I AM TO EXPECT FROM MY BROTHER NOW I AM DELIVERED UP TO HIM ON RECOLLECTION
I HAVE BOTH YOUR LETTERS AT ONCE IT IS VERY UNHAPPY MY DEAR SINCE YOUR FRIENDS WILL HAVE YOU MARRY THAT A PERSON OF YOUR MERIT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY A SUCCESSION OF WORTHLESS CREATURES WHO HAVE NOTHING BUT THEIR PRESUMPTION FOR THEIR EXCUSE
AND THERE'S NO MORE TO BE SAID ONLY MY DEAR I SHALL KEEP A GOOD LOOK OUT UPON YOU
SALLY MARTIN POLLY HORTON
I DARE NOT ASK TO GO TO MY DAIRY HOUSE AS MY GOOD GRANDFATHER WOULD CALL IT FOR I AM NOW AFRAID OF BEING THOUGHT TO HAVE A WISH TO ENJOY THAT INDEPENDENCE TO WHICH HIS WILL HAS ENTITLED ME AND AS MATTER ARE SITUATED
ARE CONDIGNLY AND AS MAY BE SAID CONSEQUENTIALLY PUNISHED FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID CONSIDERATE READERS WILL NOT ENTER UPON THE PERUSAL OF THE PIECE BEFORE THEM
MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TO MISS HOWE
AND NO ONE IS SO PROUD AS BELL SHE HAS OWNED HER LOVE HER UNEASY DAYS AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND HER REVENGE GRAFTED UPON HER LOVE TO HER FAVOURITE BETTY BARNES
DIFFERENT PERSONS AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED HAVE BEEN OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS
IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO SAY LOW AS I AM IN SPIRITS THAT I AM VERY ANGRY WITH YOU FOR YOUR REFLECTIONS ON MY RELATIONS PARTICULARLY ON MY FATHER AND MOTHER AND ON THE MEMORY OF MY GRANDFATHER
WRETCHES THAT LOOKING UPON THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY
GRUDGING IT TO YOU AT THE TIME AS HE DID AND LOOKING UPON IT AS HIS RIGHT AS AN ONLY SON
HE CANNOT ANSWER FOR WHAT HIS DESPAIR WILL MAKE HIM DO INDEED HE SAYS HIS RELATIONS THE LADIES PARTICULARLY ADVISE HIM TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A LEGAL REMEDY BUT HOW HE ASKS CAN A MAN OF HONOUR
I WOULD NOT HAVE MISTER SOLMES I TELL HIM THAT TO RETURN AS I UNDERSTAND HE DOES DEFIANCES FOR DEFIANCES TO MY RELATIONS IS FAR FROM BEING A PROOF WITH ME EITHER OF HIS POLITENESS
WILL BE FOUND NOT ONLY THE HIGHEST EXERCISE OF A REASONABLE AND PRACTICABLE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MINDS ENDOWED WITH THE NOBLEST PRINCIPLES OF VIRTUE AND RELIGION BUT OCCASIONALLY INTERSPERSED SUCH DELICACY OF SENTIMENTS PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE OTHER SEX
BUT ABOVE ALL TO INVESTIGATE THE HIGHEST AND MOST IMPORTANT DOCTRINES NOT ONLY OF MORALITY BUT OF CHRISTIANITY BY SHOWING THEM THROWN INTO ACTION IN THE CONDUCT OF THE WORTHY CHARACTERS WHILE THE UNWORTHY
TO BE DEEP YOU SEE
IF WHEN YOU WRITE TO ME YOU ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP FROM ME ANY SECRET OF YOUR HEART LET ME ADD THAT IF YOU WOULD CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY TELL ME HOW FAR LOVELACE HAS OR HAS NOT A HOLD IN YOUR AFFECTIONS
AND FINDING NEITHER MISTER SYMMES NOR MISTER MULLINS WILL BE ACCEPTED HAS PROPOSED MISTER WYERLEY ONCE MORE
TO INDUCE ME AT ONE TIME TO ACQUIESCE WITH HIS COMPLIMENTS AT ANOTHER TO BE MORE COMPLAISANT FOR HIS COMPLAINTS AND IF THE CONTRADICTION BE NOT THE EFFECT OF HIS INATTENTION AND GIDDINESS I SHALL THINK HIM AS DEEP AND AS ARTFUL TOO PROBABLY AS PRACTISED
AND LIVING UP TO IT AND UPON IT YOUR YOUTH PROTECTED FROM BLIGHTING TONGUES BY THE COMPANY OF YOUR PRUDENT NORTON AS YOU HAD PROPOSED
YOU MUST RECOLLECT THE MANY INSTANCES OF MY IMPERTINENCE WHICH YOU HAVE FORGIVEN AND THEN SAY THIS IS A MAD GIRL BUT YET I LOVE HER AND SHE IS MY OWN
NOR MY DEAR DOES YOUR OWN MOTHER ALWAYS ESCAPE THE KEEN EDGE OF YOUR VIVACITY ONE CANNOT ONE'S SELF FORBEAR TO WRITE OR SPEAK FREELY OF THOSE WE LOVE AND HONOUR WHEN GRIEF FROM IMAGINED HARD TREATMENT
MY SISTER HE SAYS REPORTS THE SAME THINGS AND THAT WITH SUCH PARTICULAR AGGRAVATIONS OF INSULT UPON HIM THAT HE CANNOT BUT BE EXTREMELY PIQUED AS WELL AT THE MANNER
EXPECTING A LIGHT NOVEL OR TRANSITORY ROMANCE AND LOOK UPON STORY IN IT INTERESTING AS THAT IS GENERALLY ALLOWED TO BE AS ITS SOLE END RATHER THAN AS A VEHICLE TO THE INSTRUCTION
AND IF MISTER LOVELACE SHOULD FOLLOW ME THINGS MIGHT BE WORSE THAN THEY ARE NOW BUT I HAVE BESOUGHT MY MOTHER WHO IS APPREHENSIVE OF MISTER LOVELACE'S VISITS
LET US SEE WHAT THEIR NEXT STEP WILL BE AS TO LOVELACE WHILE HE TELLS HIS OWN STORY
AND LAID A GENEROUS MIND UNDER OBLIGATION AND DEPENDENCE YOU VERY INGENIOUSLY ACCOUNT FOR THE LOVE WE BEAR TO ONE ANOTHER FROM THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR TEMPERS I OWN I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT
INTO A LAP DOG WELL BUT IF YOU HAVE NOT THE THROBS AND THE GLOWS YOU HAVE NOT AND ARE NOT IN LOVE GOOD REASON WHY BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT BE IN LOVE
IN BEING SO CARELESS AS HE IS OF HIS REPUTATION I THINK A MAN CAN BE SO BUT FROM ONE OF THESE TWO REASONS EITHER THAT HE IS CONSCIOUS HE DESERVES THE ILL SPOKEN OF HIM OR THAT HE TAKES A PRIDE
DO YOU HEAR SISTER CLARY TAKING THEIR SILENCE FOR APPROBATION OF WHAT HE HAD DICTATED YOU ARE NOT TO RECEIVE VISITS
AND THEIR MOTIVES FOR PERMITTING ME TO GO CLARY SAID MY MOTHER AS SOON AS I ENTERED THE GREAT PARLOUR YOUR REQUEST TO GO TO MISS HOWE'S FOR A FEW DAYS HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND GRANTED
INDEED MY BELOVED MISS HOWE I AM ASHAMED TO HAVE YOUR MOTHER SAY WITH ME IN HER VIEW
CAN TAKE EFFECT I CANNOT FOR MY OWN PART THINK SO WELL OF MYSELF AS TO IMAGINE THAT THEY CAN WISH THEIR KINSMAN TO PERSEVERE IN HIS VIEWS WITH REGARD TO ME THROUGH SUCH CONTEMPTS AND DISCOURAGEMENTS
THOSE PARTS OF IT WHICH ARE PROPOSED TO CARRY WITH THEM THE FORCE OF AN EXAMPLE OUGHT TO BE AS UNOBJECTIONABLE AS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DESIGN OF THE WHOLE AND WITH HUMAN NATURE
AS YOU HARSHLY CALL IT ONE OF THE FIRST CONDITIONS OF OUR MUTUAL FRIENDSHIP WAS EACH SHOULD SAY OR WRITE TO THE OTHER WHATEVER WAS UPON HER MIND WITHOUT ANY OFFENCE TO BE TAKEN A CONDITION
YOUR INSOLENT BROTHER IS GOVERNED BY WHICH WILL ACCOUNT FOR ALL HER DRIVING YOU HAVE ALREADY OWNED THAT HER OUTWARD EYE WAS FROM THE FIRST STRUCK WITH THE FIGURE AND ADDRESS OF THE MAN WHOM SHE PRETENDS TO DESPISE AND WHO
FOR HER LOVERS SHE PUT FURTHER SWEETNESS AND BODY INTO THE STIRRUP CUP BY STIRRING HONEY AND BARLEY MEAL INTO IT TODAY WE MIGHT WHIP THIS UP IN AN ELECTRIC MIXER TO TOAST HER MEMORY

PERFIDIOUS ENEMY COULD NOT HAVE DEVISED A BETTER PLAN THAN THAT SUGGESTED BY THE WORTHY PRINCESS IN HER DESIRE TO DEFEND HER PROTEGEE SARAH CAME TOWARDS HER
IN THE MEANWHILE HE CONSOLED THESE POOR PEOPLE AND EXHORTED THEM TO PATIENCE SPAKE TO THEM OF GOD WHO WATCHES OVER THE BLACK AND THE WHITE MAN WITH AN EQUAL EYE OF ANOTHER WORLD NOT PEOPLED WITH MASTERS AND SLAVES
MY DEAR BARON BUT IT IS GROWING LATE AND HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS IS ANXIOUS THAT YOUR COURIER SHOULD START FOR GEROLSTEIN WITH AS LITTLE DELAY AS POSSIBLE IN TWO HOURS TIME HE SHALL BE ON THE ROAD
AT THE MALEVOLENCE OF THESE REMARKS SHE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AND SAID ALOUD FROM THE END OF THE SALOON IN WHICH SHE WAS SITTING MY DEAR SARAH COME HERE SARAH ROSE IT WAS
NOT SEEING HER ANY MORE AT THE OGRESS'S
IN A SHORT TIME I SHALL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO CONCEAL MY SITUATION AND I OUGHT NOT TO BLUSH AT THAT OF WHICH I AM ON THE CONTRARY SO PROUD AND WOULD DESIRE OPENLY TO ACKNOWLEDGE
I MEAN TO SAY WELL WHAT THAT I AM A CONVICT WHO HAS SERVED HIS TIME
INDEED REPLIED MURPHY BUT I NEVER DID WRONG TO ANY ONE EXCLAIMED THE CHOURINEUR AND I WOULD SOONER DIE OF HUNGER THAN ROB BUT I HAVE DONE WORSE THAN ROB HE ADDED BENDING HIS HEAD DOWN
SEYTON GAVE THE PRINCE EIGHT DAYS TO DECIDE HIS SISTER COULD NOT LONGER ENDURE THE CRUEL ANGUISH OF UNCERTAINTY AND IF SHE MUST RENOUNCE RODOLPH'S LOVE SHE MUST ACT UP TO HER PAINFUL RESOLVE AS PROMPTLY AS MIGHT BE
THEY SAY HE TRIED TO KILL HIS WIFE YES BUT THROUGH THE INTERFERENCE OF MONSEIGNEUR
SO MAGNIFICENTLY VARIEGATED AND AS SUCH PORTRAYING THE THEATRICAL AND PUERILE PHASE OF SOVEREIGN POWER HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FEELS THE MORE SENSIBLY THE VANITY OF THOSE BARREN POMPS AND GLORIES OF THE WORLD
OF THE GRAND DUKE AT A CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN DIET THE PROPHECY OF THE SCOTCH SOOTHSAYER WAS FULFILLED SARAH WEDDED THE HEIR TO A THRONE WITHOUT QUENCHING THE FIRE OF HIS LOVE
WHOSE CONFIDENCE IN HER WAS ONLY EQUALLED BY HIS LOVE
THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE CONSTRAINT
FOR HE HAD BOUGHT THE PROPERTY THROUGH AN AGENT AT THIS MOMENT TWO PERSONS WHO HAD COME FROM PARIS IN A CABRIOLET ALIGHTED AT THE DOOR OF THE SHOP THE ONE WAS MURPHY QUITE CURED OF HIS WOUND
YOU SEE TO BE DRESSED IN THIS WAY SPOILS A FELLOW AND SO YOU SEE WHEN I PUT ON AGAIN MY OLD SMOCK FROCK AND TROUSERS I SHA'N'T LIKE IT AND THEN TO GAIN FOUR FRANCS A DAY
WHAT A COUNTENANCE HE WHO LOOKED SO MILD AND GENTLE I WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED AT THAT MOMENT I WAS INDEED WELL WHAT THEN YOU SAID TO ME GOOD DAY CHOURINEUR
SEYTON WAS CHARGED BY THE GRAND DUKE WITH AN ERRAND TO VISIT SEVERAL BREEDING STUDS IN AUSTRIA THIS MISSION WHICH HE COULD NOT REFUSE WOULD ONLY DETAIN HIM A FORTNIGHT HE SET OUT WITH MUCH REGRET
WHO WAS EMPLOYED IN THE INFIRMARY ATTACHED TO HIS DWELLING A VERY REMARKABLE DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE COMBINED WITH A CONSTANT AND DEEP COMMISERATION FOR THE SICK POOR TO WHOM HE GAVE WITH THE UTMOST ATTENTION AND CARE THE MEDICINE ORDERED BY THE DOCTORS
AND TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS BOUND TO A STAKE HIS SKIN WAS TORN WITH THE LASH WHILST THEY BORE CECILY TO THE HAREM OF THE PLANTER IN HIS SIGHT THE CONDUCT OF THE PLANTER WAS BRUTAL AND HORRIBLE IT WAS ADDING ABSURDITY TO CRUELTY
QUITE READY TO MEET BORES AND DEFY THEM JUST AS THE ROMAN SOLDIER WHO BEFORE A FORCED MARCH USED TO SOLE HIS SANDALS WITH LEAD AND SO FOUND ALL FATIGUE LIGHT BY LEAVING THEM OFF I NOW DISCOVER THE USEFULNESS OF THE COLONEL
HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE PARIS SOME DAYS AFTER THE AFFAIR OF THE ALLEE DES VEUVES AND HE FORGOT YOU MY MAN
TO ENLIGHTEN RODOLPH ON THE INTERESTED VIEWS OF SARAH WAS TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE RECEPTION WHICH A LOVER IS SURE TO GIVE WHEN SHE WHOM HE LOVES IS DEPRECIATED IN HIS EYES AND THEN
IS THERE IN THE WHOLE GERMANIC CONFEDERATION A MORE ELEGANT FIGURE MORE FLOURISHING AND SPLENDID MOUSTACHES AND A MORE COMPLETE MILITARY FIGURE AND WHEN HE IS FULLY DECORATED SCREWED IN
WOULD NO LONGER CONCEAL FOR HER PREGNANCY MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIDDEN LONGER HAD SHE BUT HAVE CHOSEN BUT THE AMBITIOUS WOMAN HAD SOUGHT THIS DISPLAY IN ORDER TO COMPEL RODOLPH TO DECLARE HIS MARRIAGE
I HAVE THE HONOUR TO FULFIL THE FUNCTIONS OF CHAMBERLAIN AND AIDE DE CAMP
WHICH ALTHOUGH SECRET SHOULD BE LEGAL AND ONLY AVOWED AFTER THE DECEASE OF THE GRAND DUKE SARAH WAS OF A NOBLE AND ANCIENT HOUSE AND SUCH A UNION WAS NOT WITHOUT PRECEDENT
AND THAT IT CANNOT LAST I WOULD RATHER SLEEP ALL MY LIFE ON THE WRETCHED STRAW BED IN MY COCK LOFT THAN SLEEP FIVE OR SIX NIGHTS ONLY IN A GOOD BED THAT'S MY VIEW OF THE THING AND YOU ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIAR IN YOUR VIEW
AND SO PERFIDIOUSLY ENSNARED INTO AN INEXTRICABLE POSITION HARDLY EXCITED AN INTEREST IN THE MIND OF THIS SELFISH CREATURE AND IN HER CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIM
BUT DAVID OUGHT TO HAVE CONSIDERED HIMSELF FREE AND EMANCIPATED IN FACT AND IN LAW WHEN HE SET FOOT IN FRANCE DAVID'S LOYALTY IS VERY RARE HE HAD PROMISED MISTER WILLIS TO RETURN AND HE DID SO
WELL AND MONSEIGNEUR SAYS THAT THANKS TO THE COLONEL HE IS IN THE HABIT OF FINDING EVEN THE DULLEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BEARABLE BEFORE CERTAIN AUDIENCES WHICH ARE OF NECESSITY
BUT THE BEST THING IS TO SLEEP ALWAYS IN A GOOD BED AND NO MISTAKE IT IS BETTER TO HAVE A BELLYFUL OF VICTUALS EVERY DAY THAN TO STARVE WITH HUNGER AH HERE IS A BUTCHERY HERE SAID THE CHOURINEUR
TO THE EXTREME GRATIFICATION OF THE BLACK DOCTOR WHOSE FELLOWS REGARDED HIM AS A DIVINITY AMONGST THEM FOR HE HAD WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY IT IS TRUE OBTAINED FROM THEIR MASTER SOME FEW INDULGENCES AND WAS HOPING TO PROCURE STILL MORE
WHO WERE ON THE MORNING BEFORE US WALKING IN THE SQUARE BEFORE THE CHURCH WERE VERY ANXIOUSLY BESTIRRING THEMSELVES TO LEARN WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD ARRIVE WHO HAD RECENTLY BECOME THE PURCHASER OF THE MOST ELIGIBLE PREMISES
THE MAN WAS MAD AS WELL AS BRUTAL WE WERE UTTERLY DISGUSTED MONSEIGNEUR DID NOT SAY A WORD AND WE LEFT THE CELL THIS DUNGEON WAS SITUATED AS WELL AS THE HOUSE ON THE SEASHORE
THESE MEN TORTURE THEIR SLAVES AND YET DO NOT TAKE ANY PRECAUTION AGAINST THEM BUT SLEEP WITH DOORS AND WINDOWS OPEN WE EASILY GOT ACCESS TO THE SLEEPING ROOM OF THE PLANTER WHICH WAS LIGHTED ON THE INSIDE BY A SMALL GLASS LAMP
HER MATERNITY WAS ONLY WITH HER A MEANS OF ACTING MORE EFFECTUALLY ON RODOLPH AND HAD NO SOFTENING EFFECT ON HER IRON SOUL THE YOUTH HEADLONG LOVE AND
HORRIBLE BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHING DAVID MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE EYES OF HIS BRUTAL MASTER A COMPLETE LIVING REMORSE SUCH CONDUCT WAS DICTATED ALIKE BY REVENGE AND JEALOUSY
ONE MOMENT SAID THE CHOURINEUR WITH A DOWNCAST AND EMBARRASSED AIR TAKING MURPHY BY THE ARM LISTEN WHILST I SAY A WORD TO YOU
POOR CHILD SHE NEVER LIKED TO DO WRONG SHE WAS SO YOUNG AND THEN THE HABIT
I WAS AS SMART AS A LANDLORD OR A DENTIST YOU APPOINTED ME TO MEET YOU THIS MORNING
THAT HE HAD BEEN CONTENTED WITH A VERY SLENDER SALARY MISTER WILLIS WAS DESPERATELY ENRAGED AND TELLING HIM HE WAS A CONTUMACIOUS SLAVE THREATENED HIM WITH THE CHAIN DAVID REPLIED WITH A FEW BITTER AND VIOLENT WORDS
WHO HAVE ASSUMED THEIR PRETENDED MISSIONS WITH SO SERIOUS AN AIR TO TELL THE TRUTH I HAVE NEVER CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD WHY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS ATTACHED THE COLONEL AND THE COUNT TO HIS PRIVATE PERSON
WHEN THE KEYS OF OFFICE ARE SUSPENDED FROM HIS SHOULDERS APROPOS BARON MONSEIGNEUR DECLARES THAT THE SHOULDERS OF A CHAMBERLAIN HAVE A PECULIAR PHYSIOGNOMY
TO RETURN HOME TO ONE'S OWN FIRESIDE TO WARM YOURSELF IF COLD OR DRY YOURSELF IF WET TO FIND YOUR HOUSEKEEPER OR A GOOD JOLLY PLUMP WIFE CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT WITH A PARCEL OF CHILDREN TO FEEL IN YOUR POCKETS
A FEW MINUTES LATER WE WERE AGAIN ON BOARD THE BRIG WHICH INSTANTLY SET SAIL IT APPEARS TO ME MY DEAR MURPHY
DAVID MIGHT CHOOSE ANOTHER WIFE OR MISTRESS WHICHSOEVER MIGHT BEST SUIT HIS INCLINATION
THE MALADY MADE FEARFUL STRIDES DAVID ONLY COULD SAVE THE COLONIST BUT WILLIS DISTRUSTFUL AS ALL EVIL DOERS ARE IMAGINED THAT THE BLACK WOULD REVENGE HIMSELF
WELL WELL DON'T LET US SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT ONLY I HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE TO FIND YOU OUT YOU DO NOT NOW GO TO THE OGRESS'S NO WHY NOT
RENDERED THE MORE INSUPPORTABLE BY HER PREGNANCY IN THIS EXTREMITY SHE BOLDLY PROPOSED TO THE YOUNG PRINCE TO TELL ALL TO HIS FATHER
CALUMNIATORS AND PROVE TRIUMPHANTLY THAT THE FAIR PROPORTIONS OF HER PROTEGEE HAD LOST NOT ONE JOT OF THEIR SYMMETRY AND DELICACY ALAS THE MOST
TEMPTED TO PRESENT HIMSELF BACKWARDS THAT HIS IMPORTANCE MAY AT ONCE BE SEEN FELT AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT IS THAT THE INCESSANT SUBJECT OF THE COUNT'S MEDITATIONS IS TO ASCERTAIN
YOU TOLD ME I AM GLAD I HAVE FOUND YOU AND STILL HAPPY PERHAPS
HIS FOREFINGER POINTED TO THE ROOF AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE COLONIST SAID IN A SOLEMN TONE GOD AND THEN WAS SILENT GOD REPLIED THE PLANTER BURSTING INTO A LOUD FIT OF LAUGHTER TELL HIM THEN
AFTER THAT FATAL NIGHT THEN MONSEIGNEUR WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT WITHOUT THINKING OF YOU
AND WITH DAVID WHO DURING THE LATE FEARFUL DISTEMPER HAD ATTENDED HER WITH THE MOST VIGILANT CARE AFTERWARDS A DEEP AND MUTUAL LOVE REPAID HIM THE DEBT OF GRATITUDE DAVID'S TASTE
AND WHO DID NOT ARRIVE UNTIL THE SECOND DAY AND WHEN RESTORED TO HEALTH AT LAST THE COLONIST NOT DESIRING TO BLUSH BEFORE HIS OWN SLAVE WHOSE PRESENCE CONSTANTLY OPPRESSED HIM WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS EXCESSIVE NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT
AND THE MEDICAL MAN OF MONSEIGNEUR DECLARED IT IN A PROCES VERBAL THAT THE TWO SLAVES COULD NOT HAVE LIVED EIGHT DAYS LONGER IN THIS FRIGHTFUL DUNGEON IT REQUIRED THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CARE TO SNATCH DAVID AND CECILY FROM ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH
AND TO SEE HIM WALK WITH BOTH HIS HANDS IN THE POCKETS OF HIS LONG AND WARM COAT OF DARK BROADCLOTH HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR ONE OF THE MOST INOFFENSIVE CITIZENS IN THE WORLD FAITH MY FINE FELLOW
RECEIVED THE DEGREE OF SURGEON AND PHYSICIAN WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED SUCCESS AND THEN RETURNED TO AMERICA TO PLACE HIMSELF AND HIS SKILL UNDER THE DIRECTION OF HIS MASTER
THIS EXALTED FLIGHT OF AMBITION STUPEFIED THE DOCTOR WHO HAD NEVER IMAGINED THAT SARAH'S IMAGINATION SOARED SO HIGH A MARRIAGE SURROUNDED BY NUMBERLESS DIFFICULTIES
FOR HE HAD SAVED THEM BODY AND SOUL THEY KNEW THE CARE HE HAD BESTOWED ON HIM WHEN HE LAY TOSSING WITH FEVER BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AND SHAKING OFF THE DEADENING APATHY WHICH ORDINARILY BESETS SLAVERY
HE DID NOT CONSIDER AS HIS OWN THE INSTRUCTION WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED WITH HIS MASTER'S MONEY AND BESIDES HE HOPED TO IMPROVE MORALLY AS WELL AS PHYSICALLY THE SUFFERINGS OF THE SLAVES HIS FORMER COMPANIONS HE TRUSTED TO BECOME NOT ONLY THEIR DOCTOR
POLIDORI BOUND RODOLPH AND SARAH TO HIM BY A TIE OF THE STRONGEST GRATITUDE OR AT LEAST BY THE COMPLICITY OF A DANGEROUS ACT NO DOUBT ALL MIGHT BE DISCOVERED AND THE DOCTOR EXPOSED TO THE ANGER
AND IT REQUIRED ALL THE DEEP RESPECT DUE TO THE GRAND DUCHESS TO REPRESS THE MURMUR OF SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION WHEN THE YOUNG LADY CROSSED THE ROOM THE NEAREST SIGHTED PERSONS SAW WHAT SARAH
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MISTER WILLIS SITUATED ON THE BORDERS OF THE SEA WAS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY LEAGUES FROM THE NEAREST TOWN AND THE MEDICAL MEN OF THE DISTRICT IGNORANT AS THEY WERE GAVE THEMSELVES
AND THEN IN THE MORNING IN THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE TO SEIZE AN OX BY THE HORNS PARTICULARLY WHEN HE'S FIERCE NOM DE NOM HE MUST BE FIERCE THEN TO PUT ON THE RING TO CLEAVE HIM DOWN CUT HIM UP
THE LEAST THINGS BECOME GREAT EVENTS IN THE COUNTRY
DRESS HIM TONNERRE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY AMBITION AS IT WAS THE GOUALEUSE'S TO SUCK BARLEY SUGAR WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE UN
AND WHERE YOU WILL GAIN FOUR FRANCS A DAY FOUR FRANCS A DAY
HAVING TILL THEN SLUMBERED WAS SUDDENLY AWAKENED AND DEVELOPED ITSELF WITH FEARFUL ENERGY YOU KNOW THE REST AND ALL THE SCANDAL OF THE ADVENTURES THAT FOLLOWED AFTER HAVING BEEN TWO YEARS A WIFE DAVID
FOR USING DAVID IN THE MOST SHAMEFUL MANNER AND ENTIRELY PREVENTING HIM FROM EFFECTING THE MALICIOUS DESIGNS OF WHICH HE SUSPECTED HIM CONSIDERING HIM AS ACTUATED BY AN IRREPRESSIBLE AMOUNT OF TERROR
CERTAIN THAT HE COULD NOT MISTAKE SARAH'S VIEWS THE DOCTOR WAS SORELY PERPLEXED HE HAD THREE WAYS BEFORE HIM TO INFORM THE GRAND DUKE OF THE MATRIMONIAL PROJECT TO OPEN RODOLPH'S EYES
AND DANGERS APPEARED IMPOSSIBLE TO POLIDORI AND HE FRANKLY TOLD SEYTON THE REASONS WHY THE GRAND DUKE WOULD NEVER SUBMIT TO SUCH A UNION SEYTON AGREED IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REASONS BUT PROPOSED
WHAT A BLOW FOR THE VANITY OR THE HEART OF THE YOUNG PRINCE TO LET HIM KNOW THAT IT WAS FOR HIS ROYAL RANK ALONE THAT THE LADY WAS DESIROUS TO WED HIM ON THE OTHER HAND BY LENDING HIMSELF TO THIS MATCH
TRUE I HAVE ALWAYS FORGOTTEN THAT SINCE THE ABSENCE OF COLONEL VERNER
POSSESSION RENDERED RODOLPH MORE CIRCUMSPECT AND COOLED DOWN THAT VIOLENCE WHICH MIGHT HAVE COMPROMISED THE SECRET OF HIS PASSION FOR SARAH BUT DIRECTED BY SEYTON AND THE DOCTOR THE YOUNG COUPLE MANAGED SO WELL
OUR CONDUCT WAS CONTRARY TO THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY I KNOW BUT IF YOU HAD SEEN IN WHAT A HORRIBLE STATE WE FOUND THIS UNFORTUNATE AND HALF DEAD COUPLE IF YOU HAD HEARD THE SACRILEGIOUS DEFIANCE
TO KEEP MYSELF WARM I HAD NOT SEEN YOU SINCE THE NIGHT WHEN THE WHITE HAIRED NEGRO HAD PUT OUT THE SCHOOLMASTER'S EYES BY JOVE IT QUITE SHOOK ME THAT AFFAIR DID
THE CHANNEL OF THEIR MUTUAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR WHAT PURPOSE WE SHALL SEE HEREAFTER A FEW DAYS AFTER SEYTON'S DEPARTURE SARAH WAS AT THE EVENING COURT OF THE DOWAGER GRAND DUCHESS
WHY MY DEAR FELLOW
TELL GOD TO COME AND SNATCH YOU FROM MY POWER I DEFY HIM THEN WILLIS OVERCOME BY FURY AND INTOXICATION SHOOK HIS FIST TO HEAVEN AND SAID IN BLASPHEMOUS LANGUAGE YES I DEFY GOD TO CARRY OFF MY SLAVES BEFORE THEY ARE DEAD
AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION THEREFORE HE RESOLVED ON SERVING SARAH BUT WITH A CERTAIN QUALIFICATION WHICH WE WILL PRESENTLY REFER TO RODOLPH'S PASSION HAD REACHED A HEIGHT ALMOST OF FRENZY
AND SHE IN DEEP DESPAIR SOUGHT DAVID AND TOLD HIM ALL THE BRUTAL ATTEMPTS THAT SHE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO AND WITH DIFFICULTY ESCAPED THE BLACK COMFORTED HER AND INSTANTLY WENT TO MISTER WILLIS TO REQUEST HER HAND IN MARRIAGE
THIS CONDUCT SEEMS LESS STUPID BUT QUITE AS FEROCIOUS A SHORT TIME AFTER THESE EVENTS WE ARRIVED IN AMERICA MONSEIGNEUR HAD FREIGHTED A DANISH BRIG AT SAINT THOMAS'S AND WE VISITED INCOGNITO ALL THE SETTLEMENTS OF THE AMERICAN COAST
HE ADDED WITH PERFECT SINCERITY HE AND HIS SISTER WOULD INSTANTLY LEAVE GEROLSTEIN SARAH PARTICIPATED IN THE PRINCE'S AFFECTION BUT PREFERRING DEATH TO DISHONOUR SHE COULD ONLY BE THE WIFE OF HIS HIGHNESS
DAVID BREATHED THE LANGUAGE AND THE HOPE OF A FREE AND HAPPY IMMORTALITY
FOR A BUTCHER IN THAT TOWN AND WHICH WERE EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THE CHURCH ONE OF THOSE IDLERS MORE INQUISITIVE THAN HIS COMPANIONS WENT AND ASKED THE BUTCHER BOY
I OPPOSE A VIOLENCE THAT SAVES GOD WILL JUDGE BETWEEN US WE THEN RETREATED LEAVING MISTER WILLIS STUPEFIED MOTIONLESS AND BELIEVING HIMSELF UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A DREAM
BUT WHICH I OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL FROM THE MASTER WHO EMPLOYS ME BECAUSE IF HE IS OFFENDED BY IT WHY THEN YOU SEE WHY AFTERWARDS WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY
AND IN A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR HIS SISTER SHE WAS CHAGRINED YET SATISFIED AT THE DEPARTURE OF HER BROTHER FOR SHE WOULD LOSE HIS ADVICE BUT THEN HE WOULD BE SAFE FROM THE GRAND DUKE'S ANGER
SO NOW MY DEAR MURPHY FAREWELL TILL THE EVENING TILL THE EVENING ADIEU HAVE YOU THEN FORGOTTEN THAT THERE IS A GRAND BALL AT THE EMBASSY AND THAT HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL BE PRESENT
WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED BY RESULTS SO HAPPY TOOK PLACE IN THE CHAPEL OF THE PALACE OF MONSEIGNEUR BUT BY A MOST EXTRAORDINARY REVULSION OF CONDUCT HARDLY WAS SHE IN THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF AN UNHOPED FOR POSITION
WHAT YOU ARE UP AGAIN I SEE SO MUCH THE BETTER SO MUCH THE BETTER
TO LEND HIMSELF TO THE MARRIAGE
I HAVE KILLED MY FELLOW CREATURE IN A PASSION BUT THAT IS NOT ALL HE CONTINUED AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE I WILL TELL EVERYTHING TO MY EMPLOYER I WOULD RATHER BE REFUSED AT FIRST THAN DETECTED AFTERWARDS YOU KNOW HIM
WAS HARDLY TO BE RECOGNISED IN HIS PRESENT ATTIRE HIS COUNTENANCE HAD UNDERGONE THE SAME CHANGE HE HAD PUT OFF WITH HIS RAGS HIS SAVAGE COARSE AND VULGAR AIR
THOSE WORDS CHEERED ME UP AGAIN DIRECTLY TONNERRE I I SHALL NEVER FORGET HIM HE TOLD ME I HAD HEART AND HONOUR THAT'S ENOUGH UNFORTUNATELY MY LAD
AND MOREOVER SO STRONG A PREPOSSESSION FOR THE STUDY OF BOTANY AS APPLIED TO MEDICINE THAT WITHOUT ANY TUITION HE HAD COMPOSED AND CLASSIFIED A SORT OF FLORA OF THE PLANTS AROUND THE DWELLING AND THE VICINITY
BUT WILL YOU COME INTO THE SHOP UNTIL OUR HORSE HAS RESTED AWHILE THE CHOURINEUR AND MURPHY ENTERED THE SHOP AND THEN WENT TO SEE THE YARD WHERE THREE SPLENDID OXEN
HE THREW IT ON THE FELLOW'S BED AND ADDED
HE SENT OFF AN EXPRESS FOR A DOCTOR BUT HE COULD NOT REACH HIS ABODE IN LESS THAN SIX AND THIRTY HOURS REALLY THIS ATTACK SEEMS PROVIDENTIAL THE DESPERATE CONDITION OF THE MAN WAS QUITE DESERVED BY HIM
DID NOT TELL ME TO DO SO AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HE HAD NO FURTHER OCCASION FOR ME BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT HE WOULD AT LEAST DESIRE TO EXPRESS HIS GRATITUDE TO YOU
WHEN FORGETTING ALL THAT DAVID HAD SUFFERED FOR HER AND WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED FOR HIM BLUSHING IN THE NEW WORLD TO BE WEDDED TO A BLACK CECILY SEDUCED BY A MAN OF MOST DEPRAVED MORALS COMMITTED HER FIRST FAULT
BROUGHT ON AN INFLAMMATORY ATTACK OF THE MOST DANGEROUS DESCRIPTION THE SYMPTOMS OF WHICH APPEARED WITH THE RAPIDITY PECULIAR TO SUCH AFFECTIONS THE PLANTER WAS CARRIED TO HIS BED
WHO SAT UPRIGHT IN HIS BED HIS BRAIN STILL DISTURBED BY THE EFFECT OF HIS DRUNKENNESS YOU HAVE TO NIGHT DEFIED GOD TO CARRY OFF YOUR TWO VICTIMS BEFORE THEIR DEATH AND HE HAS TAKEN THEM SAID MONSEIGNEUR
WHO WITH A MERRY FACE AND ACTIVE HANDS WAS VERY BUSY IN COMPLETING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE SHOP
AND TO HAVE AT HAND AT ALL TIMES A SKILFUL PRACTITIONER THE COLONIST MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEND DAVID TO FRANCE TO LEARN SURGERY AND MEDICINE
WELL WHAT FOLLOWED IN MY LIFE I NEVER SAW SO DISTRESSING A SPECTACLE PALE WAN MEAGRE HALF NAKED AND COVERED WITH WOUNDS DAVID AND THE UNHAPPY GIRL CHAINED BY THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY
THE NUMBERLESS RULES AND STRICT OBSERVANCES OF ETIQUETTE WHO BEARS WITH MORE BECOMING DEMEANOUR AN ENAMELLED CROSS AROUND HIS NECK OR MORE MAJESTICALLY COMPORTS HIMSELF
THE CHAISE HOUSE THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE THE LOFTS AND THE OUT BUILDINGS OF THE HOUSE WHICH WERE ALL IN EXCELLENT ORDER AND KEPT WITH A CLEANLINESS AND CARE WHICH BESPOKE REGULARITY AND EASY CIRCUMSTANCES
ALONG WHICH WE WERE SAILING WE WERE MOST HOSPITABLY RECEIVED BY MISTER WILLIS WHO THE EVENING AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AFTER HE HAD BEEN DRINKING AND AS MUCH FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF WINE AS FROM A DESIRE TO BOAST TOLD US IN A HORRID TONE OF BRUTAL JESTING
MY GOOD MURPHY SAID HE
AND THE PLANTER PAID ALL THE EXPENSES OF HIS COURSE OF STUDY
UNTIL THE BROTHER AND SISTER SAW THE UNBRIDLED PASSION OF THEIR DUPE REACH ITS UTMOST EXCESS AND THAT HIS INFATUATION WHICH HE COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN THREATENED TO BURST FORTH AFRESH AND DESTROY ALL THAT THEY RESOLVED
VIOLENTLY EXCITED BY CONSTRAINT AND THE SKILFUL MANAGEMENT OF SARAH WHO PRETENDED TO FEEL STILL MORE THAN HE DID THE INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES
AS HE LISTENED TO THE BLOWS OF THE CHOPPER WHICH THE BOY WAS USING AND OBSERVED THE QUARTERS OF BEEF THROUGH THE CURTAINS YES MY LAD IT BELONGS TO A FRIEND OF MINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT WHILST THE HORSE JUST RECOVERS HIS WIND
HE ENTREATED SUPPLICATED AND HIS MASTER LOST HIS TEMPER DAVID BLUSHING TO HUMILIATE HIMSELF FURTHER SPAKE IN A FIRM TONE OF HIS SERVICES AND DISINTERESTEDNESS
OF THE GRAND DUKE BUT THEN THE MARRIAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED THE UNION LEGAL THE STORM WOULD BLOW OVER AND THE FUTURE SOVEREIGN OF GEROLSTEIN WOULD BECOME THE MORE BOUND TO POLIDORI IN PROPORTION
MONSEIGNEUR LEFT WITHOUT GIVING ANY ORDERS ABOUT YOU I HAVE NOTHING BUT WHAT MONSEIGNEUR GIVES ME AND I AM UNABLE TO REPAY AS I COULD WISH ALL THAT I OWE YOU PERSONALLY
WHY I SHALL BE VERY SORRY FOR IT THAT'S ALL I MEANT TO SAY MY GOOD FELLOW THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO RECOMPENSE YOUR SERVICES BUT THAT HE SHOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM
TOO SELF POSSESSED TO COMPROMISE AND BETRAY HERSELF IN THE EYES OF THE COURT AND RODOLPH PERCEIVING THE NECESSITY OF DISSIMULATION IMITATED SARAH'S PRUDENCE THE LOVERS SECRET WAS CAREFULLY PRESERVED FOR SOME TIME NOR WAS IT
REQUISITE TO CROSS THE CIRCLE TO REACH THE PLACE WHERE THE PRINCESS WAS SEATED WHO WAS ANXIOUS MOST KINDLY TO DESTROY THE RUMOUR THAT WAS CIRCULATED AND BY THE SIMPLE FACT OF THUS CROSSING THE ROOM
AN AFFECTION THAT HIS PATERNAL ANGER WOULD GRADUALLY SUBSIDE AND SHE WOULD AT LAST TAKE IN THE COURT OF GEROLSTEIN THE RANK WHICH WAS DUE TO HER SHE MIGHT SAY IN A DOUBLE SENSE BECAUSE SHE WAS ABOUT
FOR AFTER HAVING SCOURGED HIM WITH A ROD HE HAD THROWN HIM INTO PRISON AT LAST HORRIFIED AT THE PROGRESS OF HIS ILLNESS BROKEN DOWN BY BODILY ANGUISH AND THINKING THAT AS DEATH ALSO STARED HIM IN THE FACE
WHY YOU SEE WHEN YOU CAME TO WHERE I WAS AT WORK AT THE TIMBER YARD YOU SAID MY LAD I AM NOT RICH BUT I CAN PROCURE YOU A SITUATION WHERE YOUR WORK WILL BE EASIER THAN ON THE QUAI
AS PRETTY AS CECILY DAVID TALKED OF HIS LOVE LOVE SO LONG AND TENDERLY SHARED AND THE PLANTER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS DAVID URGED BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN
THAT HE MIGHT MARRY HER THAT INSTANT THE DOCTOR RESOLVED FOR REASONS OF HIS OWN
WHOSE SHAPE MAY BE SPANNED BY TEN FINGERS I HARDLY KNOW YOU AGAIN WE WILL RELATE HEREAFTER THE RESULTS OF THIS DISCOVERY WHICH LED TO GREAT AND TERRIBLE EVENTS AT THIS MOMENT
I WHO NEVER EARNED BUT TWO AND THAT ALL AT ONCE
BUT WITH THE JUST AND THE UNJUST OF ANOTHER LIFE IN ETERNITY WHERE MAN WAS NO LONGER THE BEAST OF BURDEN THE PROPERTY THE THING OF HIS FELLOW MAN BUT WHERE THE VICTIMS OF THIS WORLD WERE SO HAPPY THAT THEY PRAYED IN HEAVEN FOR THEIR TORMENTORS
OH FROM SOME FOOLISH NOTIONS I HAVE HAD VERY WELL BUT TO RETURN TO WHAT YOU WERE TELLING ME
IS ALSO VERY SERVICEABLE TO OUR DEAR LORD FOR ALWAYS HEARING AT HIS SIDE THE TINKLING OF THIS OLD CRACKED BELL SHINING AND CHATTERING CONTINUALLY SEEING THIS SOAP BUBBLE SO PUFFED UP WITH NOTHINGNESS
TELL ME IN WHAT COURT IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU FIND A MORE PERFECT MODEL OF A CHAMBERLAIN
UNIFORMED GOLD LACED PLUMED ET CETERA ET CETERA IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE A MORE GLORIOUS SELF SATISFIED PROUD HANDSOME ANIMAL TRUE BUT IT IS HIS VERY GOOD LOOKS THAT PREVENT HIM
MANY OF THE LADIES PRESENT LOOKED AT HER WITH AN ASTONISHED AIR AND WHISPERED TO THEIR NEIGHBOURS THE GRAND DUCHESS JUDITH IN SPITE OF HER NINETY YEARS HAD A QUICK EAR AND A SHARP EYE AND THIS LITTLE WHISPERING DID NOT ESCAPE HER
FOR HE MUST AFTER THAT HAVE REQUIRED THE MAN'S SERVICES PRECISELY SO FOR THAT VERY DAY THE VERY FURY INTO WHICH HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF JOINED TO THE DRUNKENNESS IN WHICH THE BRUTE INDULGED EVERY EVENING
HE HAD ONE CHANCE LEFT IN TRUSTING TO THE GENEROSITY OF HIS SLAVE AFTER MANY DISTRUSTING DOUBTS WILLIS ORDERED DAVID TO BE UNCHAINED AND DAVID SAVED THE PLANTER FOR FIVE DAYS AND FIVE NIGHTS
WE RETURNED TO OUR BRIG WHICH WAS MOORED A SHORT DISTANCE OFF AND AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN ALL IN THE BUILDING WERE PLUNGED IN PROFOUND SLEEP MONSEIGNEUR WENT ON SHORE WITH EIGHT MEN WELL ARMED AND GOING STRAIGHT TO THE PRISON
FOR FEAR OF AROUSING THE GRAND DUKE'S SUSPICIONS AS HE WOULD BE INEXORABLE AND DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR ONLY HAPPINESS THAT OF SEEING EACH OTHER EVERY DAY THE YOUNG PRINCE PROMISED TO BE CAUTIOUS AND CONCEAL HIS LOVE THE SCOTCH MAIDEN WAS TOO AMBITIOUS
HE WAS THEIR IDOL A YEAR PASSED AWAY IN THIS MANNER
WAS TOO REFINED TO ALLOW HIM TO BOAST OF HIS HAPPINESS BEFORE THE TIME WHEN HE SHOULD MARRY CECILY WHICH WAS TO BE WHEN SHE HAD TURNED HER SIXTEENTH YEAR MISTER WILLIS IGNORANT OF THEIR LOVE HAD THROWN HIS HANDKERCHIEF RIGHT ROYALLY AT THE PRETTY METISSE
IT WAS THEN THAT THIS WOMAN EVINCED ALL THOSE EXACTIONS WHICH WERE SO NEW TO AND SO MUCH ASTONISHED RODOLPH SHE PROTESTED WITH HYPOCRITICAL TEARS STREAMING FROM HER EYES
AND HE IS BESIDES ONLY THIRTY EIGHT STRONG AS A BULL WITH AN IRON CONSTITUTION AND VERY FOND OF HIS BUSINESS THE INDUSTRIOUS AND CIVIL JOURNEYMAN THAT YOU SAW IN THE SHOP SUPPLIES HIS PLACE
AND OBSERVED SO MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION TOWARDS EACH OTHER THAT THEY ELUDED ALL DETECTION AN EVENT IMPATIENTLY DESIRED BY SARAH SOON TURNED THIS CALM INTO A TEMPEST SHE WAS ABOUT TO BECOME A MOTHER
HAD TAKEN HER AWAY FROM THERE
FROM THIS PERIOD DAVID HAS BEEN ATTACHED TO THE SUITE OF MONSEIGNEUR AS A MEDICAL MAN AND IS MOST DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO HIM DAVID MARRIED CECILY OF COURSE ON ARRIVING IN EUROPE THIS MARRIAGE
THE COLONIST SAID TO HIM WITH CRUEL IRONY WELL DOCTOR HOW GOES IT YOU WHO ARE SO CLEVER WHY DON'T YOU CURE YOURSELF THE BLACK REPLIED BY A NOBLE WORD AND A DIGNIFIED GESTURE HE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND SLOWLY
AN APPEARANCE AT ONCE CONSTRAINED AND REPULSIVE WHICH IT IS PAINFUL TO LOOK AT FOR ALAS AND ALACKADAY IT IS AT THE BACK OF A CHAMBERLAIN THAT THE SYMBOL OF HIS OFFICE GLITTERS AND AS MONSEIGNEUR AVERS
HE WATCHED AND TENDED HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN HIS FATHER COUNTERACTING THE DISEASE STEP BY STEP WITH GREAT SKILL AND PERFECT KNOWLEDGE UNTIL AT LAST HE SUCCEEDED IN DEFEATING IT TO THE EXTREME SURPRISE OF THE DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN SENT FOR
OF BESIDES HER LOVE FOR RODOLPH IN TRUTH THIS SELFISH COLD AMBITIOUS WOMAN HAD NOT FELT THE ICE OF HER HEART MELT EVEN BY THE BEAMS OF THE PASSIONATE LOVE WHICH HAD BEEN BREATHED TO HER
WHICH HONOUR AND DUTY PLACED BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR LIBERTY IN A FEW DAYS MORE THE YOUNG PRINCE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIMSELF THUS
IF IT WAS ONLY WHEN I HAD MONTFAUCON FOR A SLAUGHTER HOUSE AND BROKEN DOWN HORSES FOR CATTLE IT IS DROLL BUT IF I HAD THE MEANS A BUTCHER'S IS THE TRADE IN WHICH I SHOULD SET UP FOR I LIKE IT TO GO ON A GOOD NAG TO BUY CATTLE AT FAIRS
WHEN MAY WE EXPECT THEIR RETURN WILL THEY HAVE SOON COMPLETED THEIR RESPECTIVE MISSIONS YOU KNOW THAT MONSEIGNEUR WILL KEEP THEM AWAY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE THAT HE MAY ENJOY MORE SOLITUDE AND LIBERTY
AND WHEN HE CONSIDERED THE INFLUENCE WHICH DAVID HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE SLAVES HE BELIEVED HIM CAPABLE OF PLACING HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF A REBELLION TO AVENGE HIMSELF OF HIS WRONGS THIS FEAR WAS ANOTHER MOTIVE WITH THE COLONIST
THE GRAND DUCHESS WHO HOWEVER WOULD NOT BE CONVINCED IN SPITE OF HER EYESIGHT SAID IN A LOW VOICE TO SARAH MY DEAR CHILD HOW VERY ILL YOU HAVE DRESSED YOURSELF TO DAY YOU
THE MANAGEMENT OF ALL HE FOUND A PRIEST WITNESSES AND THE UNION ALL THE FORMALITIES OF WHICH WERE CAREFULLY SCRUTINISED AND VERIFIED BY SEYTON WAS SECRETLY CELEBRATED DURING A TEMPORARY ABSENCE
SHE MADE A SIGN TO ONE OF THE LADIES IN WAITING TO COME TO HER AND FROM HER SHE LEARNED THAT EVERYBODY WAS REMARKING THAT THE FIGURE OF MISS SARAH SEYTON OF HALSBURY WAS LESS SLENDER
DRUNK WITH WINE AND FEROCITY YOU WOULD COMPREHEND HOW MONSEIGNEUR DESIRED AS HE SAID ON THIS OCCASION TO ACT AS IT WERE IN BEHALF OF PROVIDENCE
WE WILL CONTENT OURSELVES WITH STATING WHAT THE READER HAS NO DOUBT ALREADY GUESSED THAT FLEUR DE MARIE WAS THE FRUIT OF THE
WITH MUCH CAPABILITY WHEN HE GOES TO THE FAIRS TO PURCHASE CATTLE I SAY AGAIN IS HE NOT A LUCKY FELLOW
ON THEIR FINAL COUP THE DOCTOR'S CHARACTER AUTHORISING THE CONFIDENCE BESIDES THE MORALITY WHICH INVESTED IT SEYTON OPENED TO HIM ON THE NECESSITY OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN RODOLPH AND SARAH OTHERWISE
I FOLLOWED YOU I CHOSE THE MOST SPICY ATTIRE THAT MOTHER HUBART HAD YOU ADVANCED ME THE MONEY TO PAY HER
LESS DELICATE IN ITS PROPORTIONS THAN USUAL THE OLD PRINCESS ADORED HER YOUNG PROTEGEE AND WOULD HAVE ANSWERED TO GOD HIMSELF FOR SARAH'S VIRTUE INDIGNANT
THE HISTORY OF DAVID AND CECILY I FORGOT TO SAY THAT AFTER HAVING MALTREATED THE GIRL HE HAD THROWN HER INTO A DUNGEON ALSO AS A PUNISHMENT FOR HER DISDAIN OF HIM HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS ON HEARING WILLIS'S FEARFUL NARRATION
WAS A METISSE ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE NAMED CECILY AND FOR THIS POOR GIRL MISTER WILLIS TOOK A FANCY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HIS ADVANCES WERE REPULSED AND OBSTINATELY RESISTED CECILY WAS IN LOVE
WHEN WE ARE BOTH IN A DULL MOOD FOR I WILL DEFY THE MOST HYPOCHONDRIACAL PERSON IN EXISTENCE NOT TO BURST WITH LAUGHTER AT THE NARRATIVE AS WELL AS WITH CERTAIN PASSAGES IN THE DESPATCHES OF THESE WORTHY GENTLEMEN
BUT YOU SEE THERE ARE LUCKY AND UNLUCKY PEOPLE AND WHEN I THINK THAT I AM GOING TO GAIN FOUR FRANCS A DAY AND KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE WHO ONLY EARN THE HALF OR EVEN LESS WILL YOU COME UP AND SEE THE REST OF THE HOUSE
WHO LIVED HOWEVER VERY LONG IN A WORD THIS CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE BROTHER AND SISTER CLEARLY DEVELOPED THEIR UNBOUNDED SELFISHNESS THEIR AMBITIOUS CALCULATIONS THEIR IMPATIENCE
BUT SOON RESTORED THROUGH THE CAREFUL ATTENTIONS AND EFFICACIOUS REMEDIES OF DAVID OUT OF THIRTY NEGROES DANGEROUSLY AFFECTED BY THIS FATAL DISEASE ONLY TWO PERISHED MISTER WILLIS
TAKING HIS HAT UP IN HASTE
AND BY CONTRAST HAS OFTEN DERIVED THE MOST SERIOUS AND HAPPY IDEAS FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF HIS USELESS AND PATTERING CHAMBERLAIN WELL WELL BUT LET US BE JUST MY DEAR MURPHY
WHICH ALMOST AMOUNTED TO HOMICIDE AND LAID BARE THE SPRINGS OF THAT DARK CONSPIRACY CROWNED BY THE MARRIAGE OF RODOLPH ONE OF SARAH'S LETTERS TO HER BROTHER WAS ABSTRACTED BY POLIDORI
THEN TAKING A BAG WHICH I CARRIED
WHAT THE DEVIL ONE DOES NOT OPEN A DOOR WITH ONE'S BACK AT ALL EVENTS BARON THE COURIER THE COURIER SAID MURPHY POINTING TO THE CLOCK
AS TO THE ERRAND ON WHICH HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS HAS EMPLOYED EACH OF THEM AS AN OSTENSIBLE MOTIVE FOR GETTING RID OF THEM IN A QUIET WAY SENDING ONE TO AVIGNON AND THE OTHER TO STRASBOURG I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT SOME DAY
BURST OPEN THE DOORS AND FREED DAVID AND CECILY THE TWO VICTIMS WERE CARRIED ON BOARD SO QUIETLY THAT THEY WERE NOT PERCEIVED AND THEN MONSEIGNEUR AND I WENT TO THE PLANTER'S HOUSE STRANGE CONTRAST
TO GIVE BIRTH TO A CHILD WHICH WOULD BE THE HEIR PRESUMPTIVE TO THE GRAND DUKE THESE PRETENSIONS ALARMED RODOLPH HE KNEW THE DEEP ATTACHMENT WHICH HIS FATHER HAD FOR HIM
I FOUND YOU THERE IN A CAB AND HERE WE ARE WELL DO YOU FIND ANYTHING TO REGRET IN ALL THIS
FOR IN FACT DAVID NO LONGER BELONGED TO HIM WE CALCULATED AS NEARLY AS WE COULD THE EXPENSE WHICH HIS STUDIES HAD COST FOR EIGHT YEARS AND THEN THE PRICE THRICE OVER OF HIMSELF AND CECILY AS SLAVES
SARAH PROMISED TO KEEP SEYTON FULLY INFORMED DAY BY DAY OF THE PROGRESS OF EVENTS SO IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF THEM AND THAT THEY MIGHT CORRESPOND MORE SURELY AND SECRETLY THEY AGREED UPON A CIPHER
FOR EVERY MUSKRAT'S SUMMER HOUSE HAS SEVERAL BURROWS LEADING TO IT WHEN THEY REACHED THE OLD NEST AT THE END ALL OF THEM TRIED TO GET IN AT ONCE AND THEY PUSHED EACH OTHER AROUND WITH THEIR BROAD LITTLE HEADS
HE WAS THINKING OVER AND OVER SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED AND HE KNEW THAT BACK IN THE POND HIS MOTHER WOULD BE TRYING TO FIND HIM AND COULD NOT THE BOYS CARRIED HIM TO THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW AND PUT HIM DOWN ON THE GRASS
OH ANSWERED THE GREEN BROWN FROG SADLY
THEY HAVE LARGE MOUTHS AND TEETH IN THEIR MOUTHS AND THEY ARE ALWAYS STICKING OUT THEIR LOWER JAWS AND HOW DO BEGAN THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH ASK ME THAT TO MORROW SAID THEIR TEACHER
HUMPH SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE I'LL HAVE TO SEE ABOUT THAT HOW MANY ARE THERE
BUT I SHALL CHOOSE THE GAMES THE OLDEST FIVE WILL PLAY MUD TURTLES IN WINTER THE NEXT FIVE WILL PLAY FROGS IN WINTER AND THE YOUNGEST FIVE WILL PLAY SNAKES IN WINTER
BUT THEN YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT STUPID OF COURSE NOT REPLIED THE MUD TURTLE
IT IS A LOVELY PLACE BUT I COULD NEVER HAVE A NEST ALONE LET ME HELP YOU HE SAID I WANT TO MARRY AND HAVE A HOME WHY SAID SHE AS SHE PREENED HER FEATHERS THAT IS A VERY GOOD PLAN
THE SNAPPING TURTLE WAS MISTAKEN THOUGH WHEN HE SAID THAT THE EELS AND THE WATER ADDER HAD NO BACKBONE THEY REALLY HAD MUCH MORE THAN HE BUT THEY WORE THEIRS INSIDE WHILE HIS WAS SPREAD OUT IN THE SHAPE OF A SHELL FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE
BUT THEN HE IS A BACHELOR AND BACHELORS ARE OFTEN QUEER I NEVER WAS SAID HER HUSBAND OH SAID SHE AND BEING A WISE WIFE SHE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ELSE
WELL HOW WILL YOU PUT MY TAIL IN PLACE OF YOURS ASKED THE BACHELOR I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED THE YOUNG MINK BUT YOU ARE SO WISE THAT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW SOME WAY
HE KNEW SHE WAS ONLY PRETENDING THOUGH FOR SHE HADN'T HOPPED MORE THAN THE LENGTH OF A GRASS BLADE
AND SOME IN THE WATER FOR THEY HAD STOPPED TO FEED AND REST THOSE WHO HUNTED IN THE WATER DID SO VERY QUIETLY A CRANE WOULD STAND ON ONE LEG WITH HIS HEAD AGAINST HIS BREAST SO QUIETLY THAT ONE MIGHT THINK HIM ASLEEP BUT AS SOON AS ANYTHING EATABLE CAME NEAR
WORK FIRST YOU KNOW AND PLEASURE AFTERWARD OH SAID THE GREEN BROWN FROG
WHEN THEY WERE COLD AND HUNGRY THEY SLAPPED THEIR TAILS ON THE GROUND OR ON THE WATER AND SAID DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE SMART
WE WILL GET SOMETHING TO EAT AND THEN WE WILL SEE ABOUT MAKING YOU LUCKY THEY WENT TO THE RIVER BANK AND HAD A GOOD DINNER THE BACHELOR ATE MORE THAN BIG BROTHER FOR HIS MOUTH WAS NOT SORE BUT BIG BROTHER WAS VERY HAPPY
AND ARE AWAKE AT NIGHT WE WISH IT WOULD ALWAYS BE WARM WEATHER SAID THE YOUNG MUSKRATS WHAT'S THE USE OF WINTER HARD TO TELL ANSWERED ONE MUSKRAT
THE OTHERS SAID YOU MIGHT GIVE UP TO US BECAUSE WE'RE THE YOUNGEST THEY PUSHED AND SCRAMBLED SOME MORE AND ONE OF THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN SAID TO ONE OF THE OLDEST WELL I DON'T CARE I'M JUST AS BIG AS YOU ARE
THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED BY WHAT HIS MOTHER HAD SAID AND FOR A FEW DAYS HE TRIED TO KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM AND SO HE GREW CARELESS AND MADE PEOPLE WAIT FOR HIM JUST BECAUSE HE WAS NOT QUITE READY TO GO WITH THEM
IF I COULD ONLY REACH MY TAIL WITH MY HEAD OR EVEN WITH ONE OF MY HIND FEET
HE BEGAN TO FEEL DISCOURAGED AND TO THINK THAT THE BACHELOR'S OFFER DIDN'T MEAN VERY MUCH AFTER ALL DON'T YOU THINK SAID THE BACHELOR SLOWLY DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF YOU COULD HAVE MY LUCK
AND ALL HIS FRIENDS TOED OUT WITH THEIR TEN BACK TOES ONE YOUNG YELLOW BROWN FROG
SHE TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD LEAVE THE PLACE AT ONCE AND NOT ONE OF THEM SHOULD EVEN SET FOOT IN THE OLD NEST SUPPOSE SOMEBODY HAD GOTTEN HURT SHE SAID THIS MADE THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOK VERY SOBER
TWO NAUGHTY YOUNG WATER BOATMEN HAD SWUM QUIETLY UP ON THEIR BACKS AND STUNG THE TURTLES ON THEIR TAILS THEN THEY SWAM AWAY PUSHING THEMSELVES QUICKLY THROUGH THE WATER WITH SWIFT STROKES OF THEIR HAIRY OAR LEGS
A FINE YOUNG FELLOW BEGAN TO STRUT UP AND DOWN BEFORE THE REST BOWING LOW AND LEAPING HIGH INTO THE AIR AND EVERY NOW AND THEN WHOOPING AS LOUDLY AS HE COULD THE GULLS WHO HAD SPENT THE WINTER BY THE POND SCREAMED TO EACH OTHER THE CRANE DANCE HAS BEGUN
OUCH OUCH WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED THE MUD TURTLE THEN HE BEGAN TO SLAP THE WATER WITH HIS SHORT STOUT TAIL AND SAY OUCH
THE OTHER POND PEOPLE LIKED THEM MUCH BETTER THAN THEY DID THEIR NEIGHBORS THE MINKS THE WILD DUCKS WHO NESTED IN THE SEDGES WERE QUITE WILLING THAT THE YOUNG MUSKRATS SHOULD PLAY WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND THE MUD HENS WERE NOT AFRAID OF THEM
AND COULD DRAW IN HIS HEAD AND LEGS AND TAIL WHEN HE WANTED TO HIS SHELLS WERE GRAY QUITE THE COLOR OF A CLAY BANK AND HIS HEAD WAS LARGER THAN THOSE OF THE MUD TURTLES
I REMEMBER SO WELL MY FIRST SLOW CHILD AND HOW HE SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SINCE SHE COULD NOT EASILY GET HER FOREFEET TO HER EYES SHE SPRAWLED TO THE POND AND SWAM OFF WITH ONLY HER HEAD AND A LITTLE OF HER UPPER SHELL SHOWING ABOVE THE WATER
THEY WERE A FINE COMPANY TO LOOK UPON ORDERLY STRONG AND DIGNIFIED THEIR LONG NECKS WERE STRETCHED OUT STRAIGHT AHEAD THEIR LONG LEGS STRAIGHT BEHIND AND THEY BEAT THE AIR WITH SLOW REGULAR STROKES OF THE STRONG WINGS
AND SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER THAT SHE NEVER COULD REMEMBER WHAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN IT MADE HIM FEEL VERY BADLY TO HAVE HER LEAVE HIM SO HE WANTED A CHANCE TO TELL HER SOMETHING YET WHENEVER HE TRIED TO IT SEEMED TO STICK IN HIS BILL HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT SHE DIDN'T LIKE HIM
IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME NOT TO TELL WHAT I THINK I USED TO LIVE NEAR THEM THIS SHOWED THAT THE WISE OLD CRAYFISH HAD BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP AND KNEW HE SHOULD NOT SAY UNPLEASANT THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE IF HE COULD HELP IT
THEN HE SWAM TO SHALLOW WATER AND DREW HIMSELF INTO HIS SHELL AND LAY THERE
HIS NEIGHBORS BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND HIM BETTER AND HE WAS LESS GRUMPY SO THAT THOSE WHO WORE SHELLS WERE SOON QUITE FOND OF HIM BELOSTOMA DID NOT HAVE MANY FRIENDS AMONG THE SMALLER PEOPLE AND ONLY A FEW AMONG THE LARGER ONES THEY SAID THAT HE WAS CRUEL
THAT THE EELS HAD COME BACK TO LIVE IN THE OLD POND AGAIN MOTHER EEL OPENED HER BIG MOUTH VERY WIDE ON LAND SHE SAID DECIDEDLY AS SHE SWALLOWED THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH EELS WRIGGLE
THESE HOMES LOOKED LIKE HEAPS OF DRIED RUSHES UNLESS ONE WENT CLOSE TO THEM IF ONE DID THAT HE COULD PLAINLY SEE WHAT THEY WERE AND IF ONE HAPPENED TO BE A MUSKRAT AND COULD DIVE AND GO INTO THEM THROUGH THEIR WATERY DOORWAYS
HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NEVER SUCH A FINE MINK AS THE BACHELOR AND HE USED TO FOLLOW HIM AROUND
THE DANCE OF THE SAND HILL CRANES ONE FINE DAY IN SPRING A GREAT FLOCK OF SAND HILL CRANES CAME FROM THE SOUTH THEY WERE FLYING HIGH AND QUIETLY BECAUSE THE WEATHER WAS BRIGHT IF IT HAD BEEN STORMY
IN SPRING AND SUMMER WHEN THEY CAN FIND FRESH GRASSES AND YOUNG RUSHES OR A FEW PARSNIPS CARROTS AND TURNIPS FROM THE FARMERS FIELDS OTHER ANIMALS ARE QUITE SAFE IN THE WINTER THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON ROOTS
IT IS USEFUL IN FEELING OF THINGS SHE SAID AND THEN I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT QUITE BECOMING SHE COULD SEE HERSELF REFLECTED IN THE STILL WATER BELOW HER AND SHE NOTICED HOW PRETTILY THE DARK BROWN OF HER BACK SHADED INTO THE WHITE OF HER BELLY
THEN ONE OF THESE GREAT ANIMALS STOOPED OVER AND PICKED HIM UP AND HELD HIM BOTTOM SIDE UPPERMOST AND RAPPED ON THAT SIDE WHICH WAS FLAT AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH WAS ROUNDED AND STARED AT HIM WITH TWO GREAT EYES
YOU COULD GET ALONG PRETTY WELL WITH YOUR OWN TAIL WHY YES SAID THE YOUNG MINK WHO HAD BEGUN TO FEAR HE WAS NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING YES BUT HOW COULD THAT BE
THE SUN HAS BEEN SO HOT LATELY THAT I WAS SURE YOU WOULD DO WELL THE MOTHER TURTLE STRETCHED HER HEAD THIS WAY AND THAT UNTIL THERE WAS HARDLY A WRINKLE LEFT IN HER NECK SKIN SHE WAS SO EAGER TO SEE THEM ALL
AND THE BROTHERS WERE BIGGER THAN THE SISTERS AS MINK BROTHERS ALWAYS ARE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL THE SAME AGE ONE WAS VERY MUCH LARGER THAN ANY OF THE REST AND SO THEY CALLED HIM BIG BROTHER
HE WOULD NOT GROW AND SINCE THE SNAPPING TURTLE WAS A HEARTY EATER HIMSELF HE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE SENSE TO KEEP STILL ABOUT THAT BELOSTOMA TOLD THE MUD TURTLES WHAT THE SNAPPING TURTLE HAD SAID
AND WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SLIPPING OFF THE BACK END OF IT HE STUCK HIS CLAWS INTO THE SNAPPING TURTLE'S TAIL AND HELD ON IN THAT WAY HE KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT EASILY HURT EVEN IF HE DID MAKE A FUSS WHEN HE BUMPED HIS HEAD
YOU SLAPPED YOUR TAIL ON MY BACK
MOST OF THEM REMARKED THE TURTLES ALL OF THEM SHE SAID EXCEPT US ADDERS AND THE TURTLES I EVEN THINK THAT SOME OF THE TURTLES ARE A LITTLE QUEER DON'T YOU WE HAVE THOUGHT SO SAID THE MUD TURTLE
A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GREEN BROWN FROG WHO HAD NEVER FELT GROWN UP UNTIL NOW TRIED TO SING WITH THE OTHERS BUT SHE HAD NOT A STRONG VOICE AND WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO STOP AND VISIT WITH THE BIGGEST FROG'S SISTER
LET US GO OFF INTO THE WOODS AND REST YOU MAY BE VERY SURE HE WAS GLAD TO GO AND AS HE STALKED OFF WITH HER HE LED THE WAY TO A CHARMING NESTING PLACE HE DIDN'T KNOW JUST HOW TO TELL WHAT HE WANTED TO BUT HE HAD SEEN ANOTHER CRANE BOWING TO HER
I HOPE YOU DIVE WHERE THERE IS A SOFT BOTTOM SOMETIMES I DO AND SOMETIMES I DON'T ANSWERED THE SNAPPING TURTLE I CAN'T BOTHER TO SWIM DOWN SLOWLY AND TRY IT AND THEN GO BACK TO DIVE WHEN I WANT TO DIVE
BUT THEY WERE TOO MUCH EXCITED TO MIND AND THEY DID NOT STOP UNTIL THEIR FATHER CAME AND SLAPPED THEM WITH HIS TAIL THEN THEY KEPT STILL AND LISTENED TO THEIR MOTHER
EACH ONE HAD SO MANY EYES THAT HE COULD LOOK AT THE TEACHER WITH A FEW AND AT THE OTHER LITTLE CRAYFISHES WITH A FEW MORE AND STILL HAVE A GOOD MANY EYES LEFT WITH WHICH TO WATCH THE TADPOLES THESE EYES WERE ARRANGED IN TWO BIG BUNCHES
BABIES ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL WELL GROWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR THE YOUNGEST FIVE TO CALL OTHER MUSKRATS BABIES SO WHEN THEY WERE WARM AND WELL FED AND GOOD NATURED THEY LAUGHED AND SAID WHO CARES
THE FIRST YEAR I HAD ONLY A FEW CHILDREN THE NEXT YEAR I HAD MORE AND SO IT HAS GONE EVERY YEAR A FEW MORE CHILDREN THAN THE YEAR BEFORE UNTIL NOW I NEVER KNOW QUITE HOW MANY I DO HAVE BUT THERE IS ALWAYS ONE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
FOR ALL THE EIGHT CRANES HAD DANCED TOGETHER BUT HE THOUGHT IT VERY WONDERFUL DID YOU NOTICE TO WHOM I BOWED HE ASKED HE WAS SO EXCITED THAT HIS KNEES SHOOK AND HE HAD TO STAND ON BOTH LEGS AT ONCE TO KEEP FROM FALLING
AND FLY AROUND IN THE SUNSHINE TO FIND FOOD FOR THEIR CHILDREN AH YES SAID THE MUD TURTLE HOW THEY MUST WISH FOR SHELLS HUMPH SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHAT FOR TO FLY WITH
AND THEN SAT DOWN UNTIL IT SHOULD STOP ACHING WAIT FOR ME HE CALLED OUT TO HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS I'M COMING IN A MINUTE THE OTHER LITTLE TURTLES WAITED BUT WHEN HIS TOE WAS COMFORTABLE AGAIN AND HE STARTED TOWARD THEM HE MET A VERY INTERESTING SNAIL
AND UNLESS YOU LOOKED VERY CLOSELY YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THEY HAD ONLY TWO EYES APIECE THEY HAD GOOD EARS AND THERE WERE ALSO FINE SMELLING BRISTLES GROWING FROM THEIR HEADS
THIS IS THE SECRET ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING A LITTLE BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE CAN IS THAT ALL
AND TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS NOT THE TIP OF HIS TAIL
AS SOON AS THEY GOT NEAR THE BOYS THE SNAPPING TURTLE SPOKE OVER HIS BACK SHELL TO BELOSTOMA SLIDE OFF NOW SAID HE AND DRIVE AWAY THE SMALLER BOY
THE WATER GREW DARK AND CLOUDY BECAUSE HE KICKED UP SO MUCH MUD
EVEN THE FROGS WHO ARE AFRAID OF CRANES CREPT QUIETLY NEAR TO LOOK ON IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE ANOTHER YOUNG CRANE BEGAN TO SKIP AND HOP AND CIRCLE AROUND DROOPING HIS WINGS AND WHOOPING AS HE WENT
THAT WAS BELOSTOMA'S WAY HE WOULD STING PEOPLE WHO BOTHERED HIM BUT THEN HE ALWAYS SAID THAT THEY NEED NOT HAVE BOTHERED HIM AND PERHAPS THAT WAS SO WITH THE WATER ADDERS IT WAS DIFFERENT THEY WERE GOOD NATURED ENOUGH
IT IS SO IN THE WAY BESIDES THERE IS SUCH A STYLE ABOUT HAVING ONE'S HIND FEET DIFFERENT HE SPOKE JUST LOUD ENOUGH FOR THE BIGGEST FROG TO HEAR ANY ONE WOULD KNOW FROM THIS REMARK
THEY THOUGHT IT SOUNDED VERY MUCH THE SAME AS BEING SENT TO BED FOR BEING NAUGHTY THEY DID NOT DARE SAY ANYTHING FOR THEY KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER WAS GENTLE AS MUSKRATS ARE MOST OF THE TIME SHE COULD BE VERY SEVERE
DO YOU GOOD TO GET AWAY FROM HOME MORE NO WONDER YOUR EYES ARE WEAK WHEN YOU LIE AROUND IN THE MUD OF THE DARK POND BOTTOM ALL DAY INDEED I'LL NOT STAY YOU CAN COME TO SEE ME LIKE OTHER PEOPLE
BUT I NEVER SHALL I CAN HARDLY SEE NOW FOR THE PAIN IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY HEAD WHERE I BUMPED IT OR WAS IT THE LEFT SIDE I HIT QUEER I CAN'T REMEMBER
THEY WERE THOSE WHO THOUGHT OF STAYING THERE FOR THE SUMMER WHEN THE FLOCK AROSE TO FLY ON AGAIN EIGHT CRANES STAYED BEHIND THEY WATCHED THEIR FRIENDS FLY AWAY AND STOOD ON THE GROUND WITH THEIR NECKS AND BILLS UPLIFTED AND MOUTHS OPEN
SHE WAS QUITE OUT OF PATIENCE ALL HE CARES FOR SAID SHE IS JUST SNAPPING TURTLE SNAPPING TURTLE SNAPPING TURTLE
NOW THE BIGGEST FROG SWALLOWED A GREAT DEAL OF AIR FILLED THE SACS ON EACH SIDE OF HIS NECK WITH IT OPENED HIS BIG MOUTH AND SANG CROAKILY
AND HAVE MADE IT MY HOME EVER SINCE ONE COULD TELL BY LOOKING AT HIM THAT HE WAS RELATED TO THE MUD TURTLES HE HAD UPPER AND LOWER SHELLS LIKE THEM
I THINK THE DUCKS SPOIL THEIR CHILDREN SAID SHE THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS OVER THEM AND THEY ARE NOT NEARLY SO BRIGHT AS MY CHILDREN WHY MINE HATCH AS SOON AS THE EGGS ARE LAID AND GO HUNTING AT ONCE THEY ARE NO TROUBLE AT ALL
STAY UNDER WATER LONGER AND HUNT BY SCENT BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MINK ROUND THERE HIS FUR WAS SLEEKER AND MORE SHINING THAN THAT OF HIS FRIENDS AND IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE SISTERS OF HIS FRIENDS THOUGHT THAT HE OUGHT TO MARRY
WHILE THEY TRUMPETED OR CALLED OUT GOOD BYE STOP FOR US IN THE FALL THE FLYING CRANES TRUMPETED BACK WE WILL DON'T FORGET US THAT NIGHT THEY SLEPT NEAR TOGETHER AS THEY HAD DONE WHEN WITH THE LARGE FLOCK
I'M HERE HE CRIED JOYFULLY POKING FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER OF THEM WITH HIS HEAD THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE MOVED WITHOUT AWAKENING I TELL YOU I'M NOT HUNGRY HE MURMURED
IT IS TRUE THAT THEY HELPED KEEP THE POND SWEET AND CLEAN AND PICKED UP AND CARRIED AWAY MANY THINGS WHICH MADE THE SHORE UNTIDY STILL THEY WERE RUDE AND TALKED TOO LOUDLY AND WORE THEIR FEATHERS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE FINE LARGE BIRDS
LET THEM COME IN SWIMMING WITH THEIR CHILDREN IF THEY ARE WARM AND TIRED THE WATER ADDER LAUGHED IN HER SNAKY WAY AND SHOWED HER SHARP TEETH I HAVE HEARD SHE SAID THAT WHEN THE WILD DUCKS BRING THEIR CHILDREN HERE TO SWIM
YOU MAY BE VERY SURE I DON'T WANT TO SING THEN ANSWERED THE OLDER FROG I AM TOO TIRED BESIDES AFTER THE EGGS ARE LAID THERE IS NO REASON FOR WANTING TO SING
HE LAY PERFECTLY STILL FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM HE TRIED TO RUN AWAY THEN THEY LAUGHED AND PICKED HIM UP AGAIN AND ONE OF THEM TOOK SOMETHING SHARP AND SHINY AND CUT MARKS INTO HIS UPPER SHELL
YET THE MUD TURTLES AND SNAPPING TURTLE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO EVER CALLED UPON THEM AND FOUND THEM AT HOME THE SMALL PEOPLE WITHOUT SHELLS WERE AFRAID OF THEM AND THE CLAMS AND POND SNAILS NEVER CALLED UPON ANY ONE THE MINNOWS SAID THEY COULD NOT BEAR THE LOOKS OF THE ADDERS
ALL THE YOUNG FROGS THOUGHT HOW FINE IT WOULD BE TO BECOME THE BIGGEST FROG OF EVEN A VERY SMALL PUDDLE FOR THEN THEY COULD TELL THE OTHERS WHAT TO DO NOW THEY LOOKED AT THEIR LEADER AND EACH SAID TO HIMSELF PERHAPS
I WISH I MIGHT HELP YOU SOME TIME
AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT I HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING AND IF I AM SWIMMING UNDER THE WATER AND A DUCKLING PADDLES ALONG JUST ABOVE ME AND STICKS HIS FOOT INTO MY MOUTH I AM LIKELY TO SWALLOW HIM BEFORE I THINK THE WATER ADDER SAW THAT HE WAS PROVOKED BY WHAT SHE HAD SAID SO SHE TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
DOES MY SHELL LOOK VERY BAD HE CRIED I WISH I COULD SEE IT OH I AM SO GLAD TO GET BACK I'LL NEVER BE SLOW AGAIN NEVER NEVER HIS MOTHER CAME AND LEANED HER SHELL LOVINGLY AGAINST HIS
COME FOR THE TRAP AND THE MINK IN IT BEFORE HE FINISHED NOW TRY IT SAID HE AFTER HE HAD GNAWED FOR QUITE A WHILE THE BACHELOR BACKED OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD BUT HIS BODY STUCK IN THE HOLE
THE MINKS WERE A VERY DARK BROWN AND SCATTERED THROUGH THEIR CLOSE SOFT FUR WERE LONG SHINING HAIRS OF AN EVEN DARKER SHADE WHICH MADE THEIR COATS VERY BEAUTIFUL INDEED THE FUR WAS DARKER ON THEIR BACKS THAN ON THE UNDER PART OF THEIR BODIES
AND TALKED A WHILE WITH HIM COME ON SAID THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE DON'T LET'S WAIT ANY LONGER HE CAN CATCH UP SO THEY SPRAWLED ALONG UNTIL THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD SIT IN A ROW ON AN OLD LOG AND THEY CLIMBED ONTO IT AND SAT JUST CLOSE ENOUGH TOGETHER
HE WISHED TO BE JUST LIKE HIM IN EVERY WAY BUT ONE HE DID NOT WANT TO BE A BACHELOR THE OTHER YOUNG MINKS LAUGHED AT BIG BROTHER AND ASKED HIM IF HE THOUGHT HIS TAIL WOULD TURN WHITE IF HE FOLLOWED THE BACHELOR LONG ENOUGH
THE LARGER PEOPLE HAD BEEN SORRY TO HAVE THEM GO AND SOME OF THEM FELT THAT WITHOUT THE EELS AWAKE AND STIRRING THE POND WAS HARDLY A SAFE PLACE AT NIGHT I THINK IT IS A GOOD DEAL SAFER REMARKED A MINNOW WHO USUALLY SAID WHAT SHE THOUGHT
THE CLEVER WATER ADDER NONE OF THE POND PEOPLE WERE ALONE MORE THAN THE WATER ADDERS THE SNAPPING TURTLE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL UNTIL THE DAY WHEN HE AND BELOSTOMA DROVE AWAY THE BOYS AFTER THAT
THEN IT IS A KIND OF LUCK THAT CANNOT BE LOST IF I CARRIED MINE IN THE TIP OF MY TAIL SOMEBODY MIGHT BITE IT OFF AND LEAVE ME UNLUCKY BIG BROTHER KEPT THE SECRET
YOU ARE A GOOD FOR NOTHING BUG HE SAID YOU DO NO WORK AND YOU EAT MORE THAN ANY OTHER PERSON OF YOUR SIZE HERE NOBODY LIKES YOU
THE SLOW LITTLE MUD TURTLE WHEN THE TWENTY LITTLE MUD TURTLES BROKE THEIR EGG SHELLS ONE HOT SUMMER DAY AND POKED THEIR WAY UP THROUGH THE WARM SAND IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BURIED THEY LOOKED ALMOST AS MUCH ALIKE AS SO MANY RAINDROPS
WHAT IS THE MATTER SAID HE
AND THAT HE HAD A BAD HABIT OF USING HIS STOUT SUCKING TUBE TO STING WITH STILL BELOSTOMA DID NOT CARE HE SAID A GIANT WATER BUG DOES NOT ALWAYS LIVE IN THE WATER I SHALL HAVE MY WINGS SOON AND LEAVE THE WATER AND MARRY
THE BACHELOR SMILED AGAIN I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE SAID HE THAT MY LUCK IS NOT IN MY TAIL AND THEY NEVER BELIEVE IT I WILL TELL YOU THE SECRET OF MY LUCK
IF THEY HAD ALL BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN PLEASANTER FOR THE OLDEST FIVE WOULD PUT ON AIRS AND CALL THE OTHERS THE CHILDREN AND THE NEXT FIVE WOULD CALL THE YOUNGEST FIVE
STILL ALTHOUGH HE WAS SUCH A YOUNG CRANE AND HAD NEVER DANCED UNTIL THIS YEAR HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT SHE LIKED HIM AND ENJOYED HAVING HIM NEAR SO HE FLEW OFF TO THE FISHING PLACE WHERE HE HAD SEEN HER THE DAY BEFORE AND HE STALKED ALONG TO WHERE SHE WAS
AND THERE IS ONLY ONE OF ME SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE TO HIMSELF I MUST HAVE SOMEBODY TO HELP ME
AND THEY SAT ON THAT TO REST THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH HAD BEATEN
ASKED THE SNAPPING TURTLE AND HE WAS SNAPPY ABOUT IT OH NOTHING REPLIED THE WATER ADDER SWINGING HER HEAD BACK AND FORTH AND LOOKING AT THE SCALES ON HER BODY I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE
ONE MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE FELLOW CALLED OUT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE EELS MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER LET ME GO NEAR THEM AND NOW THEY'VE MOVED AWAY AND I WON'T EVER SEE THEM AND I THINK IT'S JUST HORRID EELS MY CHILDREN SAID THEIR TEACHER
THE BIGGEST FROG FOUND A COMFORTABLE PLACE AND SAT DOWN HE TOED IN WITH HIS EIGHT FRONT TOES AS WELL BRED FROGS DO AND ALL HIS FRIENDS TOED IN WITH THEIR EIGHT FRONT TOES HE TOED OUT WITH HIS NINE BACK TOES
ALL OF WHICH MEANT NOTHING AT ALL AND WAS ONLY SAID TO ANNOY HIS TEACHER THEY SCRAMBLED AWAY OVER THE POND BOTTOM
AND BY MISTAKE CALLED HIM THE QUICK SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
HE ONLY STARED AT THEM WITH HIS GREAT EYES AND SAID MY CHILDREN THAT STORY IS TOO SAD TO TELL AFTER THE BIGGEST FROG HAD STRETCHED ALL HIS TOES HE STRETCHED HIS LEGS AND TWITCHED HIS LIPS
AND THE WEAK WAY IN WHICH HE WAVED HIS PINCHING CLAW LEGS SHOWED HOW TIRED HE WAS AFTER HE HAD TOLD HIS PUPILS THE BEST WAY TO HOLD THEIR FOOD WITH THEIR PINCHING CLAWS
I HAVE HEARD SOME QUEER THINGS ABOUT THE EELS MYSELF SAID THE STICKLEBACK BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT MUCH AFRAID OF THEM I SUPPOSE I AM BRAVER BECAUSE I WEAR SO MANY OF MY BONES ON THE OUTSIDE JUST THEN
I WANT TO DIVE AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT YES SAID THE MUD TURTLE FATHER I KNOW HOW IT IS WHEN ONE HAS THE DIVING FEELING
AND HE PRETENDED NOT TO KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT BY IT A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS THE BACHELOR WAS CAUGHT IN A TRAP A COMMON CLUMSY WOODEN TRAP PUT TOGETHER WITH NAILS AND TWINE
AND HE BACKED INTO THE MUD KNOWING THAT FINE SOFT MUD IS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR STINGS
NONE OF THE POND PEOPLE KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO IT BUT SOMETHING HAD
AND CAN MOVE QUICKLY IF THEY WILL THIS IS WHY OTHER TURTLES SOMETIMES MAKE FUN OF A SLOW BROTHER BY CALLING HIM A LAND TORTOISE ONE BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINY AFTERNOON WHEN MOST OF THE TWENTY LITTLE TURTLES WERE SITTING ON A FLOATING LOG BY THE EDGE OF THE POND
SCRAMBLED AND CLUTCHED AND HELD ON WITH THEIR STRONG LITTLE FEET FIVE OF THEM SAID IT'S OUR TURN FIRST WE'RE THE OLDEST AND FIVE MORE SAID WELL IT'S OUR TURN NEXT ANYWAY CAUSE WE'RE NEXT OLDEST
HE BOWED TO HER OFTENER THAN TO ANY OF THE REST AND HE THOUGHT SHE NOTICED IT THEY DANCED UNTIL THEY WERE ALMOST TOO TIRED TO MOVE
WHEN THEY WERE EATING THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEGUN THE DANCE STALKED UP TO THE SISTER OF ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AS SHE STOOD IN THE EDGE OF THE POND GRACEFULLY BALANCED ON ONE LEG SHE DID NOT TURN HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM ALTHOUGH HAVING SUCH A LONG AND SLENDER NECK
THERE WAS BUT ONE SNAPPING TURTLE IN THE POND AND HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON THERE WHO HAD EVER BEEN HEARD TO WISH FOR ANOTHER HE HAD NOT ALWAYS LIVED THERE
SHE WOULD SAY NOW CHILDREN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY HAD TO STOP
POOR SORT OF FROG IT WOULD BE WHO COULDN'T LIKE OTHER PEOPLE'S TADPOLES
YES SAID A FINE OLD FELLOW WHO WAS FLOATING NEAR HER A ROW OF THEIR MOTHERS HE WAS A TURTLE WHOM SHE HAD NEVER LIKED VERY WELL BUT NOW SHE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE WAS RATHER AGREEABLE AFTER ALL
BUT I JUST MAKE THE BEST OF IT HOW ASKED THE GREEN BROWN FROG LOOKING A LITTLE MORE CHEERFUL
WHEN DID YOU THINK OF IT SO THEY WERE MARRIED AND MISSUS SAND HILL CRANE OFTEN TOLD HER FRIENDS AFTERWARD THAT MISTER CRANE WAS SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER THAT SHE JUST HAD TO MARRY HIM THEY WERE VERY VERY HAPPY AND AFTER A WHILE
IT QUITE STARTLED HER TO FIND HIM SITTING SO CLOSE TO HER
HE WOULD BEND HIS BODY STRETCH OUT HIS NECK OPEN HIS LONG SLENDER BILL AND SWALLOW IT AT ONE GULP THEN HE WOULD SEEM TO FALL ASLEEP AGAIN WHILE MOST OF THE CRANES WERE STILL FEEDING SOME OF THEM WERE STALKING THROUGH THE WOODS AND LOOKING THIS WAY AND THAT
HE WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO SLIP FROM THE LOG TO THE WATER IF ANYTHING SCARED THEM AND WHEN ONE DAY A STRANGE TURTLE FROM ANOTHER POND CAME TO VISIT HE SAID TO THE TURTLES WHO HAD ALWAYS LIVED THERE
THAT WHEN YOUNG DUCKS DIVE HEAD FIRST THEY ARE QUITE SURE TO COME UP AGAIN BUT THAT WHEN THEY DIVE FEET FIRST THEY NEVER COME UP
THEN THERE WAS NO QUARREL AMONG HER CHILDREN TO SEE WHO SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST TURN NOT AT ALL ONE YOUNG MUSKRAT SAID AREN'T YOU GOING TO LET US PLAY ANY MORE YES
SEVEN OF THEM HAD HUDDLED CLOSE TO HIM ALL WINTER COME OUT HE CRIED THE SPRING IS HERE AND IT IS NO TIME FOR FROGS TO BE ASLEEP ASLEEP NO INDEED EXCLAIMED HIS SISTER
SHE STOOD WITH HER HEAD ON HER BREAST AND LOOKED AT THE WATER AFTER A WHILE HE TRUMPETED SOFTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE JUST TRYING HIS VOICE THEN SHE GAVE A PRETTY LITTLE START AND SAID OH ARE YOU HERE HOW YOU DID FRIGHTEN ME
HIS TAIL WAS LONG AND SCALY AND POINTED AND HIS FORELEGS WERE LARGE AND WARTY THERE WERE FINE STRONG WEBS BETWEEN HIS TOES AS THERE WERE BETWEEN THE TOES OF HIS RELATIVES THE MUD TURTLES
AND HE PULLED HIS TAIL OUT OF THE MUD AND SWAM AWAY
THEY GATHERED AROUND HIM SOME OF THEM SWIMMING TO HIM SOME WALKING FORWARD SOME SIDEWISE AND SOME BACKWARD IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THEM WHICH WAY THEY CAME THEY WERE RESTLESS PUPILS AND THEIR TEACHER COULD NOT KEEP THEM FROM LOOKING BEHIND THEM
AN ELDERLY AND HARD WORKING FROG AS SHE SWAM TO THE SHORE AND CRAWLED OUT ON IT
THEY DID MOST OF THEIR HUNTING IN THE RIVER SWIMMING WITH THEIR BODIES ALMOST ALL UNDER WATER AND DIVING AND TURNING AND TWISTING GRACEFULLY AND QUICKLY WHEN THEY HUNTED ON LAND THEY COULD TELL BY SMELLING JUST WHICH WAY TO GO FOR THEIR FOOD
BUT PEOPLE SAID THAT ONE OF THE ADDERS HAD FRIGHTENED THE YELLOW BROWN FROG SO THAT HE NEVER GOT OVER IT AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE FELT SO THE WATER ADDERS WERE CERTAINLY THE CLEVEREST PEOPLE IN THE POND
AND THEN SHE ADDED WHAT A COMFORT IT WILL BE IF ANY OF THEM ARE CROSS OR RUDE TO THINK
HAS THE BUSHIEST TAIL OR THE LONGEST FUR OR THE THICKEST PADS ON HIS FEET NOW SAID THE BACHELOR WE WILL TALK ABOUT LUCK WE WILL GO TO A PLACE WHERE NOBODY CAN HEAR WHAT WE SAY
WHO THOUGHT THAT THE BACHELOR WAS TO GIVE HIM HIS WHITE TIPPED TAIL NEVER MIND NOW ANSWERED THE BACHELOR AND HE TOLD THE YOUNG MINK JUST WHERE TO GNAW FOR A LONG TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND BUT THAT OF THE YOUNG MINK'S TEETH ON THE WOOD OF THE TRAP
I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED BIG BROTHER YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO WEAR TWO ASKED THE BACHELOR OH NO ANSWERED BIG BROTHER
AS THEY CAME NEAR THE POND THEY FLEW LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL ALL SWEPT DOWN TO THE EARTH AND ALIGHTED TALL AND STATELY BY THE EDGE OF THE WATER THEY HAD EATEN NOTHING FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND WERE SOON HUNTING FOR FOOD SOME ON LAND
WITH HER TAIL TWISTED CARELESSLY AROUND A WILLOW BRANCH THE SNAPPING TURTLE AND A MUD TURTLE FATHER WERE IN THE SHALLOW WATER BELOW HER HER SLENDER FORKED TONGUE WAS DARTING IN AND OUT OF HER OPEN MOUTH
SAID THE SAUCY ONE POOH SAID THE BIGGEST ONE THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW THEY DON'T RUN ON LAND WELL I GUESS THEY DO REPLIED THE SAUCY ONE
THAT HE WAS YOUNG AND FOOLISH FOR WHEN PEOPLE ARE WISE THEY KNOW THAT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FEET AND EARS AND BODIES ARE JUST THE WAY THAT THEY WERE FIRST MADE TO BE
EVERY CRANE DANCED BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ALL AND AS THEY DID SO THEY LOOKED LOVINGLY AT EACH OTHER AND ADMIRED THE FINE STEPS AND ENJOYED THE WHOOPING THIS WENT ON UNTIL THEY WERE SO TIRED THEY COULD HARDLY STAND AND HAD TO STOP TO EAT AND REST
IT'LL DO THEM GOOD TO HEAR THE TRUTH SAID HE I ALWAYS SPEAK RIGHT OUT THEY ARE AS BAD AS THE WATER ADDER THEY HAVE NO BACKBONE THE CLAMS LISTENED POLITELY AND SAID NOTHING THEY NEVER DID TALK MUCH
I WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DO THAT ALWAYS GLAD TO HELP MY NEIGHBORS SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE PLEASANT DAY ISN'T IT I MUST TELL THE FISHES THAT THE BOYS ARE GONE THE POOR LITTLE FELLOWS WERE ALMOST TOO SCARED TO SWIM
HE MIGHT JUST AS SENSIBLY ASK PEOPLE TO ADMIRE HIM FOR NOT EATING WHEN HIS STOMACH WAS FULL
THEN HE WAS VERY VERY TIRED BUT HE WANTED SO MUCH TO GET BACK TO HIS HOME IN THE POND THAT HE STARTED AT ONCE BY MOONLIGHT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER SEEN THE MOON FOR EXCEPT WHEN THEY ARE LAYING EGGS TURTLES USUALLY SLEEP AT NIGHT
OR BECAUSE HE WANTED TO DO THIS OR LOOK AT THAT OR TALK TO SOME OTHER PERSON HE WAS A VERY TRYING LITTLE TURTLE YET HIS MOTHER LOVED HIM AND DID NOT LIKE IT WHEN THE REST CALLED HIM A LAND TORTOISE IT IS ALL RIGHT YOU KNOW TO BE A LAND TORTOISE WHEN YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER ARE LAND TORTOISES
THE OTHER POND PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS JUST LIKE THEM ALWAYS PRETENDING TO BE MORE THAN THEY REALLY WERE FIFTEEN YOUNG MUSKRATS ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ALL BORN THE SUMMER BEFORE STARTED OFF TO LOOK AT THE OLD HOME
THE BIGGEST FROG AWAKENS THE BIGGEST FROG STRETCHED THE FOUR TOES OF HIS RIGHT FOREFOOT THEN HE STRETCHED THE FOUR TOES OF HIS LEFT FOREFOOT
THE YOUNGER FROGS FOLLOWED THROUGH THE WARMER SHALLOW WATER UNTIL THEY WERE PARTLY OUT OF IT
THEN HE SWAM AWAY AND TOLD THE CLAMS WHAT HE HAD SAID
THE ADDERS WERE ALWAYS AWAY PEOPLE SAID THAT THE ADDERS WERE AFRAID OF THEM THE YELLOW BROWN FROG WISHED THAT THE ADDERS COULD BE SCARED BADLY SCARED SOME TIME SO SCARED THAT A CHILLY FEELING WOULD RUN DOWN THEIR BACKS FROM THEIR HEADS CLEAR TO THE TIPS OF THEIR TAILS
OUT IS NOT TO GET IN AND I'VE GOTTEN IN CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LUCKY TAIL TO MAKE THE TRAP OPEN ASKED BIG BROTHER I COULD DO SOMETHING WITH MY TEETH ANSWERED THE BACHELOR IF THEY WERE ONLY WHERE THE TIP OF MY TAIL IS
THE YELLOW BROWN FROG HOPPED A LITTLE NEARER AND SANG AS LOUDLY AS HE COULD
I HAVE GOOD TEETH SAID HE TELL ME WHAT TO DO IF YOU WILL HELP ME OUT SAID THE BACHELOR I WILL GIVE YOU MY LUCK AND WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE TAIL I HAVE ASKED THE YOUNG MINK
BUT THEN I GET RIGHT OVER IT I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN MY LITTLE TALK WITH HIM I DON'T SEE ANY REASON FOR TELLING HIM I AM SORRY HE IS VERY SILLY TO THINK SO MUCH OF IT HE LIFTED HIS BIG HEAD QUITE HIGH
OF COURSE I KNOW YOU CAN NEVER COME BACK BUT SEND YOUR FRIENDS HERE TO LAY THEIR EGGS WE MUSTN'T BE LEFT WITHOUT SOME OF YOUR FAMILY THANK YOU SAID BELOSTOMA
AND COULD JUST REMEMBER LEAVING HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHEN HE WAS YOUNG I WAS CARRIED AWAY FROM MY PEOPLE HE SAID AND KEPT ON LAND FOR A FEW DAYS THEN I WAS BROUGHT HERE
WHEN A CRANE IS AS MUCH EXCITED AS THAT IT IS PRETTY SERIOUS TO MY SISTER SHE ASKED CARELESSLY AS SHE DREW ONE OF HER LONG TAIL FEATHERS THROUGH HER BEAK NO SAID HE I BOWED TO HER SISTER
THEY HAD SUCH UGLY MOUTHS AND SUCH QUICK MOTIONS THE LARGER FISHES KEPT AWAY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR CHILDREN WHO WERE SMALL AND TENDER ONE MIGHT THINK THAT THE SAND HILL CRANES THE FISH HAWKS AND THE OTHER SHORE FAMILIES WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS FOR THEM BUT WHEN THEY CALLED
OR IF THEY HAD BEEN FLYING BY NIGHT AS THEY USUALLY DID THEY WOULD HAVE STAYED NEARER THE GROUND AND THEIR LEADER WOULD HAVE TRUMPETED LOUDLY TO LET HIS FOLLOWERS KNOW WHICH WAY HE WAS GOING THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TRUMPETED BUT MORE SOFTLY TO TELL HIM THAT THEY WERE COMING AFTER
BUT CUDDLED INSIDE HIS TWO SHELLS AND WENT TO SLEEP ALSO HE WAS SO TIRED THAT HE DID NOT AWAKEN UNTIL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE SKY WHEN HE DID OPEN HIS EYES HIS RELATIVES WERE SITTING AROUND LOOKING AT HIM AND HE REMEMBERED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE HE SLEPT
IF HE HAD BEEN AN OLDER CRANE AND UNDERSTOOD THE WAYS OF THE WORLD A LITTLE BETTER HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE MEANT AREN'T YOU COMING TO THAT FISHING PLACE I AM GOING NOW
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FUR ON THEIR TAILS OR ON THEIR FEET AND THOSE PARTS WERE BLACK THESE FIFTEEN CHILDREN HAD BEEN FAIRLY WELL BROUGHT UP BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD MANY CARES
IS THERE ANY REASON WHY YOU SHOULD KNOW WHICH ONES THEY ARE IT ISN'T AS THOUGH YOU WERE A BIRD AND HAD TO KEEP THEM WARM OR AS THOUGH YOU WERE A MINK AND HAD TO FEED YOUR CHILDREN THE SUN WILL HATCH THEM
THEIR MOTHER HAD BROUGHT UP A LARGE FAMILY AND WAS NOT STRONG SHE HAD JUST CAST THE SHELL WHICH SHE HAD WORN FOR A YEAR AND NOW SHE WAS WEAK AND HELPLESS UNTIL THE NEW ONE SHOULD HARDEN ON HER IT IS SUCH A BOTHER SHE SAID
AND HE RAISED ONE OF HIS HIND FEET TO SHOW WHERE HE MEANT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL HINDFOOT THICKLY PADDED AND WITH SHORT PARTLY WEBBED TOES AND NO HAIR AT ALL GROWING BETWEEN THEM THE CLAWS WERE SHORT SHARP AND CURVED
TOOK SIDES WITH ONE AND PART TOOK SIDES WITH THE OTHER WHAT HAD BEEN A LOVELY FROLIC BECAME AN UNPLEASANT DISGRACEFUL QUARREL AND THEY SAID SUCH THINGS AS THESE
AFTER SHE HAD SAID ALL THIS WHICH WAS A GREAT DEAL FOR A FROG TO SAY AT ONCE SHE SHUT HER BIG MOUTH AND SLID HER EYELIDS OVER HER EYES
THEY DO NOT ALWAYS TAKE SO MANY HOME AS THEY BROUGHT THE SNAPPING TURTLE BECAME VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HIS WARTY RIGHT FORELEG AND DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAID THE MUD TURTLE SMILED I HAVE HEARD SHE WENT ON
HE POKED HIS HEAD OUT OF THE MUD A VERY VERY LITTLE WAY AND SAW A MINNOW SWIMMING PAST GOOD DAY SAID HE IS IT TIME TO GET UP
THE CRAYFISH STUCK HIS TAIL INTO THE MUD HE OFTEN DID THIS WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED IT SEEMED TO HELP HIM THINK WHEN HE HAD THOUGHT FOR A WHILE HE WAVED HIS BIG PINCHING CLAWS AND SAID
HE HAD A GREAT POCKET IN HIS BODY FILLED WITH WATER FOR IF HIS SKIN SHOULD GET DRY HE COULDN'T BREATHE THROUGH IT AND UNLESS HE CARRIED WATER WITH HIM HE COULD NOT STAY ASHORE AT ALL
AND SLID INTO THE WATER ALL HER FRIENDS FOLLOWING HER THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE SAW THESE GREAT ANIMALS COMING TOWARD HIM HE SPRAWLED OFF THE END OF HIS LOG AND SLID INTO THE WATER AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS FOLLOWED HIM EXCEPT THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
