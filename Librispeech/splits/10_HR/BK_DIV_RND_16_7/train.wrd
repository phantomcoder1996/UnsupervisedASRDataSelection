BUT IF YOU GO DEFENDING THESE FELLOWS THEN THE SAME THING APPLIES TO YOU NEXT THING I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE YAPPING ABOUT FREE SPEECH FREE SPEECH THERE'S TOO MUCH FREE SPEECH AND FREE GAS AND FREE BEER AND FREE LOVE
WHILE SAM NODDED AT HER OVER KENNICOTT'S SHOULDER SHE WAS EMBARRASSED PERHAPS I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE AWAY I'M OUT OF PRACTISE IN LYING I WISH THEY WOULD GET IT OVER JUST A BLOCK MORE AND MY BABY
THE FURNACE SOUNDS UNALTERABLE ETERNAL REMOVING ASHES SHOVELING COAL YES SHE WAS BACK HOME NOTHING HAD CHANGED SHE HAD NEVER BEEN AWAY CALIFORNIA HAD SHE SEEN IT
HUGH WEPT WITH HER WAIT FOR MUMMY A SECOND SHE HASTENED DOWN TO THE CELLAR TO KENNICOTT HE WAS STANDING BEFORE THE FURNACE
NEW ENGLAND MILL TOWNS WITH THE HANDS LIVING IN ROWS OF COTTAGES LIKE BLOCKS OF LAVA A RICH FARMING CENTER IN NEW JERSEY OFF THE RAILROAD FURIOUSLY PIOUS RULED BY OLD MEN UNBELIEVABLY IGNORANT OLD MEN
SHE FOUND THE SAME FAITH NOT ONLY IN GIRLS ESCAPED FROM DOMESTICITY BUT ALSO IN DEMURE OLD LADIES WHO TRAGICALLY DEPRIVED OF ESTEEMED HUSBANDS AND HUGE OLD HOUSES
SITTING ABOUT THE GROCERY TALKING OF JAMES G BLAINE A SOUTHERN TOWN FULL OF THE MAGNOLIAS AND WHITE COLUMNS WHICH CAROL HAD ACCEPTED AS PROOF OF ROMANCE BUT HATING THE NEGROES OBSEQUIOUS TO THE OLD FAMILIES
WERE EQUALLY WICKED AND TO BE AVOIDED AND BY CLEAVING TO TINCOMB CHURCH THEY KEPT THEIR IDEALS FROM ALL CONTAMINATION THEY WELCOMED CAROL ASKED ABOUT HER HUSBAND GAVE HER ADVICE REGARDING COLIC IN BABIES
HERE IN GOPHER PRAIRIE WE'VE CLEARED THE FIELDS AND BECOME SOFT SO WE MAKE OURSELVES UNHAPPY ARTIFICIALLY AT GREAT EXPENSE AND EXERTION METHODISTS DISLIKING EPISCOPALIANS THE MAN WITH THE HUDSON LAUGHING AT THE MAN WITH THE FLIVVER
I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO SETTLE DOWN AND BE SATISFIED AND NOT DOES HE LIKE CARROTS YET REPLIED CAROL SHE WAS CHEERFUL AS THE SNOW BEGAN TO CONCEAL THE SLATTERNLY YARDS
THE PRESENCE OF HUGH MADE HER FEEL TEMPORARY SOME DAY OH SHE'D HAVE TO TAKE HIM BACK TO OPEN FIELDS AND THE RIGHT TO CLIMB ABOUT HAY LOFTS BUT THE FACT THAT SHE COULD NEVER BE EMINENT AMONG THESE SCOFFING ENTHUSIASTS
AND THEY MOST AFFLICT THE DISCIPLES WHO THE MOST GENEROUSLY SERVE THEM
IN THE MID AFTERNOON OF THIS SAME DAY KENNICOTT WAS CALLED INTO THE COUNTRY IT WAS BEA'S EVENING OUT HER EVENING FOR THE LUTHERAN DANCE CAROL WAS ALONE FROM THREE TILL MIDNIGHT
ALONG THE RAILROAD THE SECTIONS OF SNOW FENCE WHICH HAD BEEN STACKED ALL SUMMER IN ROMANTIC WOODEN TENTS OCCUPIED BY ROVING SMALL BOYS WERE SET UP TO PREVENT DRIFTS FROM COVERING THE TRACK
HE WAS A LAYER ON OF HANDS HE NEVER CAME TO THE HOUSE WITHOUT TRYING TO PAW HER HE TOUCHED HER ARM LET HIS FIST BRUSH HER SIDE SHE HATED THE MAN AND SHE WAS AFRAID OF HIM SHE WONDERED IF HE HAD HEARD OF ERIK AND WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE
HARRY INTERRUPTED WITH AN ACCOUNT OF HOW MUCH HE HIMSELF HAD SEEN TWO YEARS AGO WHEN KENNICOTT BOASTED WE WENT THROUGH THE MISSION AT SANTA BARBARA HARRY BROKE IN YEH THAT'S AN INTERESTING OLD MISSION SAY I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT HOTEL THERE DOC IT WAS SWELL
OH WHAT IS THERE TO CONFIDE THE PEOPLE ARE SAVORLESS AND PROUD OF IT AND EVEN IF I LIKED YOU TREMENDOUSLY I COULDN'T TALK TO YOU WITHOUT TWENTY OLD HEXES WATCHING WHISPERING
SO THE WHOLE THING WAS ILLEGAL AND LED BY THE SHERIFF PRECISELY HOW DO YOU EXPECT THESE ALIENS TO OBEY YOUR LAW IF THE OFFICER OF THE LAW TEACHES THEM TO BREAK IT IS IT A NEW KIND OF LOGIC
YET SHE ASSERTED THAT SHE HAD FOUND REAL WORK DISILLUSIONS SHE DID HAVE SHE DISCOVERED THAT IN THE AFTERNOON OFFICE ROUTINE STRETCHES TO THE GRAVE SHE DISCOVERED THAT AN OFFICE IS AS FULL OF CLIQUES AND SCANDALS AS A GOPHER PRAIRIE
THE DILLONS YES REALLY QUITE A DECENT YOUNG PAIR HARVEY DILLON AND HIS WIFE HE'S A DENTIST JUST COME TO TOWN THEY LIVE IN A ROOM BEHIND HIS OFFICE SAME AS I DO HERE THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH OF ANYBODY I'VE HEARD OF THEM
THE AFTERNOON GREW OLD AND DARK AUNT BESSIE WENT HOME CAROL TOOK THE BABY INTO HER OWN ROOM THE MAID CAME IN COMPLAINING I CAN'T GET NO EXTRA MILK TO MAKE CHIPPED BEEF FOR SUPPER
DECLARED SAM AND KENNICOTT AND DAVE DYER JOINED IN A PROUD YOU BET CAROL WALKED OUT HASTILY KENNICOTT OBSERVING HER THROUGH SUPPER TIME SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS BUBBLING AND WOULD SOON BOIL OVER
AND BECAUSE IN THE STRESS OF WAR WORK WITH ITS DEMAND FOR THOUSANDS OF TEMPORARY CLERKS SHE COULD BE INITIATED INTO THE WORLD OF OFFICES HUGH WAS TO GO WITH HER DESPITE THE WAILS AND RATHER EXTENSIVE COMMENTS OF AUNT BESSIE
POINTING WITH PRIDE HARRY HAYDOCK AS CHAIRMAN INTRODUCED HONEST JIM BLAUSSER AND I AM PROUD TO SAY MY FELLOW CITIZENS THAT IN HIS BRIEF STAY HERE MISTER BLAUSSER HAS BECOME MY WARM PERSONAL FRIEND AS WELL AS MY FELLOW BOOSTER

BOOST BOYS AND BOOST TOGETHER PUT GOPHER PRAIRIE ON THE MAP BRILLIANT RECORD OF OUR MATCHLESS TEAM THEN GLORY OF GLORIES THE TOWN PUT IN A WHITE WAY WHITE WAYS WERE IN FASHION IN THE MIDDLEWEST
LYMAN CASS GAVE CHAMP A WARM BERTH AS NIGHT WATCHMAN

HE GRINNED OH MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE WHEN WILL HAS POSITIVELY KNOWN OF A CASE WHERE DOCTOR
MAY I JOIN YOU IN THE HONOR OF HAVING SOMETHING THE MATTER YES THANKS NO I THINK IT'S THE TOWN BECAUSE THEY ENJOY SKATING MORE THAN BIOLOGY BUT I'M NOT ONLY MORE INTERESTED IN BIOLOGY THAN THE JOLLY SEVENTEEN
DID NOT KEEP HER FROM BEING PROUD OF THEM FROM DEFENDING THEM IN IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH KENNICOTT WHO GRUNTED SHE COULD HEAR HIS VOICE THEY'RE SIMPLY A BUNCH OF WILD IMPRACTICAL THEORISTS SITTIN ROUND CHEWING THE RAG AND
THE BOYS WORE SHOE PACKS BLUE FLANNEL SHIRTS WITH ENORMOUS PEARL BUTTONS AND MACKINAWS OF CRIMSON LEMON YELLOW AND FOXY BROWN CAROL CRIED FINE DAY TO THE BOYS SHE CAME IN A GLOW TO HOWLAND AND GOULD'S GROCERY
THEY WERE SCARECROWS IN A SHANTY TOWN TO THINK SHE MARVELED OF COMING TWO THOUSAND MILES PAST MOUNTAINS AND CITIES TO GET OFF HERE AND TO PLAN TO STAY HERE WHAT CONCEIVABLE REASON FOR CHOOSING THIS PARTICULAR PLACE
AND I'M GOING TO BREAK HIS HEART SHE SMILED AT HIM
BY GOLLY HE KNOWS US JUST AS IF WE'D NEVER BEEN AWAY SAID KENNICOTT YOU DON'T FIND ANY OF THESE CALIFORNIA KIDS AS BRIGHT AS HE IS AT HIS AGE
ABOUT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR THE CAPTAIN INTRODUCED HER TO THE SECRETARY OF A CONGRESSMAN A CYNICAL YOUNG WIDOW WITH MANY ACQUAINTANCES IN THE NAVY THROUGH HER CAROL MET COMMANDERS AND MAJORS NEWSPAPERMEN
A WESTERN MINING SETTLEMENT LIKE A TUMOR A BOOMING SEMI CITY WITH PARKS AND CLEVER ARCHITECTS VISITED BY FAMOUS PIANISTS AND UNCTUOUS LECTURERS BUT IRRITABLE FROM A STRUGGLE BETWEEN UNION LABOR AND THE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
THROUGH LATE NOVEMBER AND ALL DECEMBER IT SNOWED DAILY THE THERMOMETER WAS AT ZERO AND MIGHT DROP TO TWENTY BELOW OR THIRTY WINTER IS NOT A SEASON IN THE NORTH MIDDLEWEST IT IS AN INDUSTRY
WHEN HE FOUND OUT I CAME FROM MINNESOTA HE ASKED ME IF I KNEW DOCTOR CLEMWORTH OF RED WING AND OF COURSE WHILE I'VE NEVER MET HIM I'VE HEARD OF CLEMWORTH LOTS OF TIMES AND SEEMS HE'S THIS MAN'S BROTHER QUITE A COINCIDENCE
THE FOUR OF THEM DRANK RATHER BAD COFFEE WHICH POLLOCK MADE ON A KEROSENE BURNER THEY LAUGHED AND SPOKE OF MINNEAPOLIS AND WERE TREMENDOUSLY TACTFUL
AND TAR BAGS IN CLOSETS AND ALL OVER TOWN SMALL BOYS WERE SQUEALING OH THERE'S MY MITTENS OR LOOK AT MY SHOE PACKS THERE IS SO SHARP A DIVISION BETWEEN THE PANTING SUMMER AND THE STINGING WINTER OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS
THE WHEAT MONEY DID NOT REMAIN IN THE POCKETS OF THE FARMERS THE TOWNS EXISTED TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THAT IOWA FARMERS WERE SELLING THEIR LAND AT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AN ACRE AND COMING INTO MINNESOTA BUT WHOEVER BOUGHT OR SOLD OR MORTGAGED
BUT WHEN SNOW HAD ENDED THE SKATING AND SHE TRIED TO GET UP A MOONLIGHT SLIDING PARTY THE MATRONS HESITATED TO STIR AWAY FROM THEIR RADIATORS AND THEIR DAILY BRIDGE WHIST IMITATIONS OF THE CITY SHE HAD TO NAG THEM THEY SCOOTED DOWN A LONG HILL ON A BOB SLED
AND WHEN HE WAS LOST SHE WANTED TO LEAP FROM THE VESTIBULE AND RUN BACK TO HIM SHE THOUGHT OF A HUNDRED TENDERNESSES SHE HAD NEGLECTED SHE HAD HER FREEDOM AND IT WAS EMPTY THE MOMENT WAS NOT THE HIGHEST OF HER LIFE BUT THE LOWEST AND MOST DESOLATE
NOT CONFINED TO MAIN STREET AND A KITCHEN BUT LINKED WITH PARIS BANGKOK MADRID SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE COULD DO OFFICE WORK WITHOUT LOSING ANY OF THE PUTATIVE FEMININE VIRTUE OF DOMESTICITY THAT COOKING AND CLEANING
OF DIGNITY COMFORT AND CULTURE WITH LAWNS AND GARDENS KNOWN FAR AND WIDE THAT THE GOPHER PRAIRIE SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC LIBRARY IN ITS NEAT AND COMMODIOUS BUILDING WERE CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THE GOPHER PRAIRIE MILLS MADE THE
WHICH SINCE ALL THE WORK WAS DONE BY ASSISTANTS WAS THE ONE SINECURE IN TOWN THE ONE REWARD FOR POLITICAL PURITY BUT IT PROVED THAT MISTER BERT TYBEE THE FORMER BARTENDER DESIRED THE POSTMASTERSHIP AT HER SOLICITATION
BUT SHE WHO WAS TENDER AND MERRY HAD BEEN MADE TIMOROUS BY GOPHER PRAIRIE EVEN HER FLIGHT HAD BEEN BUT THE TEMPORARY COURAGE OF PANIC THE THING SHE GAINED IN WASHINGTON WAS NOT INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICE SYSTEMS AND LABOR UNIONS BUT RENEWED COURAGE
THE BOUNTIFUL HARVEST INCREASING POPULATION FAIR RETURN ON INVESTMENTS ALIEN AGITATORS WHO THREATEN THE SECURITY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS THE HEARTHSTONE THE FOUNDATION OF THE STATE SENATOR KNUTE NELSON ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AMERICANISM AND
HE LIKED TO BE CALLED HONEST JIM
THEY HUNT FOR PEOPLE FROM THEIR OWN STATES TO STAND BETWEEN THEM AND THE SHAME OF NAKED MOUNTAINS THEY TALK STEADILY IN PULLMANS ON HOTEL PORCHES AT CAFETERIAS AND MOTION PICTURE SHOWS ABOUT THE MOTORS AND CROPS AND COUNTY POLITICS BACK HOME
FLATLY WE'RE GOING TO FIND ELEPHANTS WITH GOLDEN HOWDAHS FROM WHICH PEEP YOUNG MAHARANEES WITH NECKLACES OF RUBIES AND A DAWN SEA COLORED LIKE THE BREAST OF A DOVE
CHAMP IS THE SALT OF THE EARTH BUT SOMEHOW I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM JOINING YOU IN SYMBOLIC DANCING OR MAKING IMPROVEMENTS ON THE DIESEL ENGINE NO HE'S A DEAR SOUL BLESS HIM BUT HE BELONGS IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM
THE ACCEPTANCE OF WOMEN WITHOUT EMBARRASSED BANTER FOR WHICH SHE HAD LONGED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE YET THEY SEEMED TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS THE SAM CLARKS SHE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE OF SECURE REPUTATION NOT HEMMED IN BY THE FIRE OF PROVINCIAL JEALOUSIES
CHEMISTS AND GEOGRAPHERS AND FISCAL EXPERTS FROM THE BUREAUS AND A TEACHER WHO WAS A FAMILIAR OF THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE HEADQUARTERS THE TEACHER TOOK HER TO HEADQUARTERS CAROL NEVER BECAME A PROMINENT SUFFRAGIST
HE DROPPED INTO THE SHRIEKING DESK CHAIR HE LOOKED SQUARELY AT HER SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS A MAN AND LONELY THEY WERE EMBARRASSED THEY ELABORATELY GLANCED AWAY AND WERE RELIEVED AS HE WENT ON
YET MANAGED TO MAKE A VERY COMFORTABLE THING OF IT BY LIVING IN SMALL FLATS AND HAVING TIME TO READ BUT SHE ALSO LEARNED THAT BY COMPARISON GOPHER PRAIRIE WAS A MODEL OF DARING COLOR CLEVER PLANNING AND FRENZIED INTELLECTUALITY
THE LINES ARE BROKEN AND UNCERTAIN OF DIRECTION OFTEN INSTEAD OF RISING THEY SINK IN WAVERING SCRAWLS AND THE COLORS ARE WATERY BLUE AND PINK AND THE DIM GRAY OF RUBBED PENCIL MARKS A FEW LINES ARE TRACEABLE
MOST OF HER RED CROSS WORK RAY STILL NEEDED NURSING SHE EXPLAINED WHEN CAROL SAW HIM WITH HIS UNIFORM OFF IN A PEPPER AND SALT SUIT AND A NEW GRAY FELT HAT SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED HE WAS NOT MAJOR WUTHERSPOON HE WAS RAYMIE
HE SHOUTED IN THE POOL AT THE CORONADO AND HE SPOKE OF THOUGH HE DID NOTHING MORE RADICAL THAN SPEAK OF BUYING EVENING CLOTHES CAROL WAS TOUCHED BY HIS EFFORTS TO ENJOY PICTURE GALLERIES
CYNICAL SANTA CLAUS CHILDREN LOVED HIM AND HE SNEAKED AWAY FROM WORK TO TELL THEM IMPROBABLE STORIES OF SEA FARING AND HORSE TRADING AND BEARS THE CHILDREN'S PARENTS EITHER LAUGHED AT HIM OR HATED HIM HE WAS THE ONE DEMOCRAT IN TOWN
THEY UPSET AND GOT SNOW DOWN THEIR NECKS THEY SHRIEKED THAT THEY WOULD DO IT AGAIN IMMEDIATELY AND THEY DID NOT DO IT AGAIN AT ALL SHE BADGERED ANOTHER GROUP INTO GOING SKIING THEY SHOUTED AND THREW SNOWBALLS
AND NOW I EXPECT YOU TO PLAY THE GAME
AND MISTER STOWBODY A CAPITALIST BUT YOU BUSINESS MEN ARE GOING TO BEAT ALL THE REST OF US AT IT WITH YOUR SIMPLE HEARTED ENERGETIC POMPOUS SHE GOT SO FAR ONLY BECAUSE KENNICOTT WAS SLOW IN SHAKING OFF RESPECT FOR HER NOW HE BAYED
WELD AN AUTOMOBILE SPRING SOOTHE A FRIGHTENED FILLY TINKER A CLOCK CARVE A GLOUCESTER SCHOONER WHICH MAGICALLY WENT INTO A BOTTLE NOW FOR A WEEK HE WAS COMMISSIONER GENERAL OF GOPHER PRAIRIE
A GRAYHOUND ON THE SCENT A GRAYHOUND WITH GLASSES TILTED FORWARD ON HIS THIN NOSE AND A SILKY INDECISIVE BROWN MUSTACHE HE HAD A GOLF JACKET OF JERSEY WORN THROUGH AT THE CREASES IN THE SLEEVES SHE NOTED
THOUGH IT ABSORBED MOST OF HER SALARY AN EXCELLENT NURSE FOR HUGH SHE HERSELF PUT HIM TO BED AND PLAYED WITH HIM ON HOLIDAYS THERE WERE WALKS WITH HIM THERE WERE MOTIONLESS EVENINGS OF READING BUT CHIEFLY WASHINGTON WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE
CHAMP WAS BROKEN HIS RHEUMATISM WAS WORSE THE ROOMS OVER THE STORE WERE SILENT HE COULD NOT DO HIS WORK AS BUYER AT THE ELEVATOR FARMERS COMING IN WITH SLED LOADS OF WHEAT COMPLAINED THAT CHAMP COULD NOT READ THE SCALE
AND EVEN IF I AM COWARDLY AND RUN AWAY ALL RIGHT CALL IT COWARDLY CALL ME ANYTHING YOU WANT TO I'VE BEEN RULED TOO LONG BY FEAR OF BEING CALLED THINGS I'M GOING AWAY TO BE QUIET AND THINK I'M I'M GOING I HAVE A RIGHT TO MY OWN LIFE
CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE SHE TRIED TO BE CONTENT WHICH WAS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS SHE FANATICALLY CLEANED HOUSE ALL APRIL SHE KNITTED A SWEATER FOR HUGH SHE WAS DILIGENT AT RED CROSS WORK
HE WAS WHISTLING TENDERLY STARING AT THE FURNACE WITH EYES WHICH SAW THE BLACK DOMED MONSTER AS A SYMBOL OF HOME AND OF THE BELOVED ROUTINE TO WHICH HE HAD RETURNED HIS GIPSYING DECENTLY ACCOMPLISHED
SAY THIS IS FINE HAVE A FINE TRIP MY YOU LOOK LIKE A ROSE CAROL HOW DID YOU LIKE THE COAST DOC WELL WELL WELL WHERE ALL DID YOU GO BUT AS KENNICOTT BEGAN TO PROCLAIM THE LIST OF PLACES ACHIEVED
BUT NOT YET ACQUIRED THE SMELL OF PATCHOULI OR OF FACTORY SMOKE ARE JUST AS SUSPICIOUS AND RIGHTEOUS I WONDER IF THE SMALL TOWN ISN'T WITH SOME LOVELY EXCEPTIONS A SOCIAL APPENDIX SOME DAY THESE DULL MARKET TOWNS MAY BE AS OBSOLETE AS MONASTERIES
AND MY OWN SON REPROVES ME BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GIVEN HIM RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION BUT THE STORY DOESN'T GO RIGHT I'M NEITHER GROANING NOR BEING DRAMATICALLY SAVED I KEEP ON RUNNING AWAY AND I ENJOY IT I'M MAD WITH JOY OVER IT
THE WOMAN WAS MYSTERY ROMANCE A STORY WHICH TOLD ITSELF DIFFERENTLY EVERY DAY NOW SHE WAS A MURDERESS NOW THE NEGLECTED WIFE OF AN AMBASSADOR IT WAS MYSTERY WHICH CAROL HAD MOST LACKED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE
SO THAT AS THEY WAVERED WITH THEIR SUIT CASES THEY SLID AND ALMOST FELL THE WET SNOW DRENCHED THEIR GLOVES THE WATER UNDERFOOT SPLASHED THEIR ITCHING ANKLES THEY SCUFFLED INCH BY INCH FOR THREE BLOCKS IN FRONT OF HARRY HAYDOCK'S KENNICOTT SIGHED
SHE HAD SHE MEDITATED PASSED THROUGH THE NOVELTY OF SEEING THE TOWN AND MEETING PEOPLE OF SKATING AND SLIDING AND HUNTING BEA WAS COMPETENT THERE WAS NO HOUSEHOLD LABOR EXCEPT SEWING AND DARNING AND GOSSIPY ASSISTANCE TO BEA IN BED MAKING
SHE WONDERED IF SHE OUGHT TO BE OFFENDED BY HIS CARESS THEN SHE WONDERED IF HE LIKED HER HAT THE NEW ORIENTAL TURBAN OF ROSE AND SILVER BROCADE HE DROPPED HER HAND HIS ELBOW BRUSHED HER SHOULDER HE FLITTED OVER TO THE DESK CHAIR HIS THIN BACK STOOPED
AS THE TRAIN STRUCK IN AMONG THE HILLS SHE RESOLVED I'M GOING TO LOVE THE FINE WILL KENNICOTT QUALITY THAT THERE IS IN GOPHER PRAIRIE THE NOBILITY OF GOOD SENSE IT WILL BE SWEET TO SEE VIDA AND GUY AND THE CLARKS
CLOTTED PAINT CANS ALL HALF COVERED BY THE ICY POOLS WHICH FILLED THE HOLLOWS OF THE YARDS THE REFUSE HAD STAINED THE WATER TO VILE COLORS OF WASTE THIN RED SOUR YELLOW STREAKY BROWN KENNICOTT CHUCKLED
THUS SHE CHANCED TO DISCOVER THAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO
THEY SAY THERE'S A CHANCE WE MAY GET ANOTHER FACTORY CREAM SEPARATOR WORKS HE ADDED YOU MIGHT TRY TO LOOK INTERESTED EVEN IF YOU AIN'T THE BABY WAS FRIGHTENED BY THE JOVIAN ROAR RAN WAILING TO HIDE HIS FACE IN CAROL'S LAP
SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENCOUNTER ERIK IN THE EAST BUT IT WAS A CHANCE THOUGHT SOON FORGOTTEN
AND WE CALLED THE PORTER THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD PORTER ON THAT CAR AND WE HAD A COUPLE BOTTLES OF GINGER ALE
HERE A STRANGER IS TAKEN IN IF HE IS CORRECT IF HE LIKES HUNTING AND MOTORING AND GOD AND OUR SENATOR THERE WE DIDN'T TAKE IN EVEN OUR OWN TILL WE HAD CONTEMPTUOUSLY GOT USED TO THEM
AND THE DOGGED WAY IN WHICH HE ACCUMULATED DATES AND DIMENSIONS WHEN THEY FOLLOWED MONKISH GUIDES THROUGH MISSIONS SHE FELT STRONG WHENEVER SHE WAS RESTLESS SHE DODGED HER THOUGHTS BY THE FAMILIAR VAGABOND FALLACY OF RUNNING AWAY FROM THEM OF MOVING ON TO A NEW PLACE
FINDING HARD NAMES FOR OUR OPPONENTS HOW WE DO SANCTIFY OUR EFFORTS TO KEEP THEM FROM GETTING THE HOLY DOLLARS WE WANT FOR OURSELVES THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT AND THE POLITICAL ORATORS AND I SUPPOSE I DO IT WHEN I CALL MISSUS BOGART A PURITAN
WHERE EVERY HOUSE WAS OPEN TO VIEW WHERE EVERY PERSON WAS BUT TOO EASY TO MEET WHERE THERE WERE NO SECRET GATES OPENING UPON MOORS OVER WHICH ONE MIGHT WALK BY MOSS DEADENED PATHS TO STRANGE HIGH ADVENTURES IN AN ANCIENT GARDEN
WHICH HE HELD IN HIS MOUTH LIKE AN EXTRAORDINARY SET OF EXTERNAL FALSE TEETH THE UNIVERSAL SIGN OF WINTER WAS THE TOWN HANDYMAN MILES BJORNSTAM A TALL THICK RED MUSTACHED BACHELOR OPINIONATED ATHEIST GENERAL STORE ARGUER
AND FOR FOUR YEARS I LIVED OH I WON'T RHAPSODIZE ABOUT NEW YORK IT WAS DIRTY AND NOISY AND BREATHLESS AND GHASTLY EXPENSIVE BUT COMPARED WITH THE MOLDY ACADEMY IN WHICH I HAD BEEN SMOTHERED I WENT TO SYMPHONIES TWICE A WEEK
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM WITH ME SUPPOSE I REFUSE YOU WON'T FORLORNLY UH CARRIE WHAT THE DEVIL IS IT YOU WANT ANYWAY OH CONVERSATION
HER DISCOVERY THAT SHE REALLY COULD GET AWAY FROM MAIN STREET WAS AS SWEET AS THE DISCOVERY OF LOVE KENNICOTT NEVER CONSENTED DEFINITELY AT MOST HE AGREED TO A PUBLIC THEORY THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE A SHORT TRIP
CAROL WAITED FOR HIM IN THE STATION AMONG HUDDLED GERMAN WOMEN WITH SHAWLS AND UMBRELLAS AND RAGGED BEARDED FARMERS IN CORDUROY COATS PEASANTS MUTE AS OXEN IN A ROOM THICK WITH THE STEAM OF WET COATS THE REEK OF THE RED HOT STOVE
HELL HOUND YOU OLD DEVIL HOW ARE YOU ANYWAY
PASSED HER THE GINGERBREAD AND SCALLOPED POTATOES AT CHURCH SUPPERS AND IN GENERAL MADE HER VERY UNHAPPY AND LONELY SO THAT SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENLIST IN THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE ORGANIZATION AND BE ALLOWED TO GO TO JAIL
UNHAPPY WOMEN ARE GIVEN TO PROTECTING THEIR SENSITIVENESS BY CYNICAL GOSSIP BY WHINING BY HIGH CHURCH AND NEW THOUGHT RELIGIONS OR BY A FOG OF VAGUENESS CAROL HAD HIDDEN IN NONE OF THESE REFUGES FROM REALITY
SHE LOOKED ABOUT WITH IMPERSONAL EYES BUT KENNICOTT THROUGH RAIN BLURRED LASHES CAUGHT THE GLORY THAT WAS BACK HOME
HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS TABLE DESK FINGERING THE STARRY ENAMELED VASE SHE COULD NOT COMMENT SHE PICTURED HERSELF RUNNING ACROSS THE ROOM TO PAT HIS HAIR SHE SAW THAT HIS LIPS WERE FIRM UNDER HIS SOFT FADED MUSTACHE
THEY WERE COMPOSED OF ORNAMENTED POSTS WITH CLUSTERS OF HIGH POWERED ELECTRIC LIGHTS ALONG TWO OR THREE BLOCKS ON MAIN STREET THE DAUNTLESS CONFESSED WHITE WAY IS INSTALLED TOWN LIT UP LIKE BROADWAY SPEECH BY HON JAMES BLAUSSER
TOO DAMNED WET TO PAINT SIT DOWN AND TALK AND SO FOR TEN MINUTES SHE LIVED IN A ROMANTIC NOVEL HER ONLY STRUGGLE WAS IN COAXING KENNICOTT NOT TO SPEND ALL HIS TIME WITH THE TOURISTS FROM THE TEN THOUSAND OTHER GOPHER PRAIRIES
THERE'S ONE THING THAT'S THE MATTER WITH GOPHER PRAIRIE AT LEAST WITH THE RULING CLASS THERE IS A RULING CLASS DESPITE ALL OUR PROFESSIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE PENALTY WE TRIBAL RULERS PAY IS THAT OUR SUBJECTS WATCH US EVERY MINUTE
HE WAS THE GUEST OF HONOR AT THE COMMERCIAL CLUB BANQUET AT THE MINNIEMASHIE HOUSE AN OCCASION FOR MENUS PRINTED IN GOLD BUT INJUDICIOUSLY PROOF READ FOR FREE CIGARS SOFT DAMP SLABS OF LAKE SUPERIOR WHITEFISH SERVED AS FILLET OF SOLE
ONLY BY SUCH FUSSING AS THE WIDOW BOGART'S COULD SHE MAKE IT FILL HER TIME SHE COULD NOT HAVE OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT TO THE VILLAGE DOCTOR'S WIFE IT WAS TABOO SHE WAS A WOMAN WITH A WORKING BRAIN AND NO WORK
NO IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT I THINK IT'S A GREATNESS OF LIFE A REFUSAL TO BE CONTENT WITH EVEN THE HEALTHIEST MUD DON'T YOU KNOW THAT NOBODY EVER SOLVED A PROBLEM BY RUNNING AWAY FROM IT PERHAPS
SHE GLANCED ACROSS THE ALLEY AT THE ROOM WHICH FERN HAD OCCUPIED A RAG OF A GRAY CURTAIN MASKED THE STILL WINDOW
THAT'LL BE ABOUT ALL FROM YOU I'VE STOOD FOR YOUR SNEERING AT THIS TOWN AND SAYING HOW UGLY AND DULL IT IS I'VE STOOD FOR YOUR REFUSING TO APPRECIATE GOOD FELLOWS LIKE SAM I'VE EVEN STOOD FOR YOUR RIDICULING OUR WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW CAMPAIGN
SHE SAW A PENCIL MARK ON A WINDOW SILL SHE HAD MADE IT ON A SEPTEMBER DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN PLANNING A PICNIC FOR FERN MULLINS AND ERIK FERN AND SHE HAD BEEN HYSTERICAL WITH NONSENSE HAD INVENTED MAD PARTIES FOR ALL THE COMING WINTER
RINGING TO THE SKATES ON SHORE THE ICE TIPPED REEDS CLATTERED IN THE WIND AND OAK TWIGS WITH STUBBORN LAST LEAVES HUNG AGAINST A MILKY SKY HARRY HAYDOCK DID FIGURE EIGHTS AND CAROL WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE PERFECT LIFE
THAT THIS WAS THE ONE LOGICAL LOCATION FOR FACTORIES AND WHOLESALE HOUSES
THE VILLAGE VIRUS IS THE GERM WHICH IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY LIKE THE HOOK WORM IT INFECTS AMBITIOUS PEOPLE WHO STAY TOO LONG IN THE PROVINCES YOU'LL FIND IT EPIDEMIC AMONG LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND MINISTERS AND COLLEGE BRED MERCHANTS
AND KENNICOTT HAD TO MAKE HIMSELF HUMBLE AND COURT BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD THE DIM INJUSTICE OF NOT BEING UNDERSTOOD EVEN BY HIS SON LEFT HIM IRRITABLE HE FELT INJURED AN EVENT WHICH DID NOT DIRECTLY TOUCH THEM BROUGHT DOWN HIS WRATH
THE MOB FLOWING BETWEEN THE SQUATTY ROWS OF SHOPS HAD TAKEN THE ORGANIZER FROM HIS HOTEL RIDDEN HIM ON A FENCE RAIL PUT HIM ON A FREIGHT TRAIN AND WARNED HIM NOT TO RETURN THE STORY WAS THRESHED OUT IN DAVE DYER'S DRUG STORE
BEST FLOUR IN THE COUNTRY THAT THE SURROUNDING FARM LANDS WERE RENOWNED
I'LL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW I'VE SEEN EM I'VE DONE EUROPE FROM SOUP TO NUTS THEY CAN'T SPRING THAT STUFF ON JIM BLAUSSER AND GET AWAY WITH IT AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE ONLY LIVE THING IN EUROPE IS OUR BOYS THAT ARE FIGHTING THERE NOW LONDON
THIS IS A USEFUL MARKET CENTER AN INTERESTING PIONEER POST BUT IT IS NOT A HOME FOR ME MEDITATED THE STRANGER CAROL KENNICOTT SUGGESTED I'D PHONE FOR A FLIVVER BUT IT'D TAKE QUITE A WHILE FOR IT TO GET HERE LET'S WALK
SHE SPOKE ILL OF HIM AT HOME AND IN PUBLIC PLACES BUT KENNICOTT AND THE OTHER POWERS INSISTED MAYBE HE IS KIND OF A ROUGHNECK
WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ANY TOWN OF ANYWHERES NEAR OUR SIZE IN THE STATE THAT HAS SUCH A STERLING WAR RECORD ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU'D BETTER WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW
THE TOWNSMEN INVITED THEMSELVES TO THE FEAST MILLERS REAL ESTATE MEN LAWYERS MERCHANTS AND DOCTOR WILL KENNICOTT THEY BOUGHT LAND AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SOLD IT NEXT DAY AT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY AND BOUGHT AGAIN
WITH SPURIOUS ENTHUSIASM HE SAID SPLENDID I WILL FROM THE DOOR HE GLANCED AT HER CURLED IN THE PEELED LEATHER CHAIR HE SLIPPED OUT CAME BACK WITH DOCTOR AND MISSUS DILLON
I WOULDN'T CARE WHETHER IT WAS A LABORATORY OR A CARNIVAL BUT IT'S MERELY SAFE TELL ME MISTER POLLOCK WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH GOPHER PRAIRIE IS ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH IT ISN'T THERE PERHAPS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH YOU AND ME
SHE DID NOT HUNT FOR THE SORT OF VEILING SHE WANTED SHE TOOK WHAT SHE COULD GET AND ONLY AT HOWLAND AND GOULD'S WAS THERE SUCH A LUXURY AS CANNED ASPARAGUS ROUTINE CARE WAS ALL SHE COULD DEVOTE TO THE HOUSE
AND I'M GOING TO SEE MY BABY ALL THE WORDS HE'LL BE ABLE TO SAY NOW IT'S A NEW START EVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT THUS ON APRIL FIRST AMONG DAPPLED HILLS AND THE BRONZE OF SCRUB OAKS
CAN I HELP HOW COULD YOU I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BY LISTENING I HAVEN'T DONE THAT TONIGHT BUT NORMALLY CAN'T I BE THE CONFIDANT OF THE OLD FRENCH PLAYS THE TIRING MAID WITH THE MIRROR AND THE LOYAL EARS
BUT WAS I MORE HAPPY WHEN I WAS DRUDGING I WAS NOT I WAS JUST BEDRAGGLED AND UNHAPPY IT'S WORK BUT NOT MY WORK I COULD RUN AN OFFICE OR A LIBRARY OR NURSE AND TEACH CHILDREN
OH PLEASE WAIT TILL MY GENERATION HAS STOPPED REBELLING BEFORE YOURS STARTS IN WHAT'S A GENERATION IT'S A RAY IN THE ILLUMINATION OF THE SPIRIT THAT'S FOOLISH
WHEN THE BABY WAS ABED AND THEY SAT COMPOSEDLY IN CANVAS CHAIRS ON THE PORCH HE EXPERIMENTED
THAT SHE HADN'T GIVEN THEM A CHANCE TO BETRAY THEIR OPINIONS OF HER THE MEN SMILED BUT DID THEY LIKE HER SHE WAS LIVELY AMONG THE WOMEN BUT WAS SHE ONE OF THEM
AND EVERYWHERE WAS A RHYTHMIC SOUND OF WOOD SAWING IT WAS SATURDAY AND THE NEIGHBORS SONS WERE GETTING UP THE WINTER FUEL BEHIND WALLS OF CORDED WOOD IN BACK YARDS THEIR SAWBUCKS STOOD IN DEPRESSIONS SCATTERED WITH CANARY YELLOW FLAKES OF SAWDUST
SHE WAS SILENT WHEN VIDA RAVED THAT THOUGH AMERICA HATED WAR AS MUCH AS EVER WE MUST INVADE GERMANY AND WIPE OUT EVERY MAN BECAUSE IT WAS NOW PROVEN THAT THERE WAS NO SOLDIER IN THE GERMAN ARMY WHO WAS NOT CRUCIFYING PRISONERS
GUY CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING WITH THE TOWN REALLY NO WE CAN'T HE DISPOSED OF IT LIKE A JUDGE RULING OUT AN IMPROPER OBJECTION RETURNED TO MATTERS LESS UNCOMFORTABLY ENERGETIC CURIOUS
THAT WHEN SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE SHE SAW THE DOOR KNOBS THE NEWSPAPER ON THE TABLE EVERY WHITE SURFACE AS DAZZLING MAUVE AND HER HEAD WAS DIZZY IN THE PYROTECHNIC DIMNESS WHEN HER EYES HAD RECOVERED SHE FELT EXPANDED DRUNK WITH HEALTH MISTRESS OF LIFE
BUT ONE THING I'M NOT GOING TO STAND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND MY OWN WIFE BEING SEDITIOUS YOU CAN CAMOUFLAGE ALL YOU WANT TO BUT YOU KNOW DARN WELL THAT THESE RADICALS AS YOU CALL EM ARE OPPOSED TO THE WAR AND LET ME TELL YOU RIGHT HERE AND NOW
NO ONE MET THEM AND BECAUSE OF THE ICY ROADS THE ONLY CONVEYANCE AT THE STATION WAS THE HOTEL BUS WHICH THEY MISSED WHILE KENNICOTT WAS GIVING HIS TRUNK CHECK TO THE STATION AGENT THE ONLY PERSON TO WELCOME THEM
AND IF I HAD MY WAY I'D MAKE YOU FOLKS LIVE UP TO THE ESTABLISHED RULES OF DECENCY EVEN IF I HAD TO TAKE YOU WILL SHE WAS NOT TIMOROUS NOW AM I PRO GERMAN IF I FAIL TO THROB TO HONEST JIM BLAUSSER TOO
SHE FLED FROM THE THOUGHT WITH A DUBIOUS SOME DAY HER REFORMS HER IMPULSES TOWARD BEAUTY IN RAW MAIN STREET THEY HAD BECOME INDISTINCT BUT SHE WOULD SET THEM GOING NOW SHE WOULD
I THOUGHT I WAS KEEPING UP BUT I GUESS THE VILLAGE VIRUS HAD ME ALREADY I WAS READING FOUR COPIES OF CHEAP FICTION MAGAZINES TO ONE POEM I'D PUT OFF THE MINNEAPOLIS TRIPS TILL I SIMPLY HAD TO GO THERE ON A LOT OF LEGAL MATTERS
DISLOYAL NON PATRIOTIC PRO GERMAN PACIFISTS THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DID THIS ORGANIZER SAY ANYTHING PRO GERMAN NOT ON YOUR LIFE THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM A CHANCE HIS LAUGH WAS STAGEY
THEY JOURNEYED FOR THREE AND A HALF MONTHS THEY SAW THE GRAND CANYON THE ADOBE WALLS OF SANTE FE AND IN A DRIVE FROM EL PASO INTO MEXICO THEIR FIRST FOREIGN LAND THEY JOGGED FROM SAN DIEGO AND LA JOLLA TO LOS ANGELES PASADENA
MAYBE IT WASN'T EXACTLY REGULAR BUT WHAT'S THE ODDS THEY KNEW THIS FELLOW WOULD TRY TO STIR UP TROUBLE WHENEVER IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO A QUESTION OF DEFENDING AMERICANISM AND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IT'S JUSTIFIABLE TO SET ASIDE ORDINARY PROCEDURE
SHE REALIZED THAT IT WAS GUY POLLOCK I'M AWFULLY SORRY MISSUS KENNICOTT BUT I DON'T KNOW WON'T YOU COME IN AND WAIT FOR THEM
AND YOU AND ALL THESE LONG HAIRED MEN AND SHORT HAIRED WOMEN CAN BEEF ALL YOU WANT TO BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THESE FELLOWS AND IF THEY AIN'T PATRIOTIC WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM BE PATRIOTIC AND LORD KNOWS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO SAY THIS TO MY OWN WIFE
NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT COMPLICATION DID YOU IN THIS OFF TO BOHEMIA AND EXPRESS YOURSELF AND FREE LOVE AND LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE STUFF YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO ME IF YOU CAN KEEP ME CAN YOU HE MOVED UNEASILY
VERY OLD AND WEAK WHO A FEW DECADES AGO HAD BEEN BOYS AND GIRLS OF THE FRONTIER RIDING BRONCOS THROUGH THE RANK WINDY GRASS OF THIS PRAIRIE THEY HOBBLED BEHIND A BAND MADE UP OF BUSINESS MEN AND HIGH SCHOOL BOYS
AND ANNOUNCED THAT IN A FEW DAYS HE WOULD ADDRESS A FARMERS POLITICAL MEETING THAT NIGHT THE NEWS RAN A MOB OF A HUNDRED BUSINESS MEN LED BY THE SHERIFF THE TAME VILLAGE STREET AND THE SMUG VILLAGE FACES RUDDLED BY THE LIGHT OF BOBBING LANTERNS
BLACK BRANCHES THE SPONGY BROWN EARTH BETWEEN PATCHES OF DECAYED SNOW ON THE LAWNS THE VACANT LOTS WERE FULL OF TALL DEAD WEEDS STRIPPED OF SUMMER LEAVES THE HOUSES WERE HOPELESS TEMPORARY SHELTERS KENNICOTT CHUCKLED
AND THE SAME THING GOES FOR THAT CROWD OF CRABS AND SNOBS DOWN EAST AND NEXT TIME YOU HEAR SOME ZOB FROM YAHOOVILLE ON THE HUDSON CHEWING THE RAG AND BULLING AND TRYING TO GET YOUR GOAT YOU TELL HIM THAT NO TWO FISTED ENTERPRISING WESTERNER WOULD HAVE NEW YORK FOR A GIFT
FROM THE TOP GALLERY I WALKED IN GRAMERCY PARK AND I READ OH EVERYTHING THROUGH A COUSIN I LEARNED THAT JULIUS FLICKERBAUGH WAS SICK AND NEEDED A PARTNER I CAME HERE JULIUS GOT WELL
WE CAN'T GET WHOLESOMELY DRUNK AND RELAX WE HAVE TO BE SO CORRECT ABOUT SEX MORALS AND INCONSPICUOUS CLOTHES AND DOING OUR COMMERCIAL TRICKERY ONLY IN THE TRADITIONAL WAYS THAT NONE OF US CAN LIVE UP TO IT AND WE BECOME HORRIBLY HYPOCRITICAL UNAVOIDABLY
AND THAT THE STORES IN GOPHER PRAIRIE COMPARED FAVORABLY WITH MINNEAPOLIS AND CHICAGO IN THEIR ABUNDANCE OF LUXURIES AND NECESSITIES AND THE EVER COURTEOUS ATTENTION OF THE SKILLED CLERKS SHE LEARNED IN BRIEF
THEY STEPPED UNCOMFORTABLY FROM THE SAFETY OF THE PLANK PLATFORM AND BALANCING ON THEIR TOES TAKING CAUTIOUS STRIDES VENTURED ALONG THE ROAD THE SLEETY RAIN WAS TURNING TO SNOW THE AIR WAS STEALTHILY COLD BENEATH AN INCH OF WATER WAS A LAYER OF ICE
HALF AN HOUR LATER CHAIRMAN HAYDOCK MOVED A VOTE OF THANKS TO MISTER BLAUSSER THE BOOSTERS CAMPAIGN WAS ON THE TOWN SOUGHT THAT EFFICIENT AND MODERN VARIETY OF FAME WHICH IS KNOWN AS PUBLICITY
ALONG WITH GENERAL GRANT'S SWORD AND I'M OH I SUPPOSE I'M SEEKING FOR A GOSPEL THAT WILL EVANGELIZE GOPHER PRAIRIE REALLY EVANGELIZE IT TO WHAT TO ANYTHING THAT'S DEFINITE SERIOUSNESS OR FRIVOLOUSNESS OR BOTH
SHE BEGAN TO THINK WITH UNPLEASANT LUCIDITY SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE PEOPLE LIKED HER SHE HAD GONE TO THE WOMEN AT AFTERNOON COFFEES TO THE MERCHANTS IN THEIR STORES WITH SO MANY OUTPOURING COMMENTS AND WHIMSIES
BUT CAROL COULD DISCOVER NO MORE PICTURES NOR INTERESTING FOOD NOR GRACIOUS VOICES NOR AMUSING CONVERSATION NOR QUESTING MINDS SHE COULD SHE ASSERTED ENDURE A SHABBY BUT MODEST TOWN
HE WAS WELL BUT STILL WEAK FROM HAVING BEEN GASSED HE HAD BEEN DISCHARGED AND HE CAME HOME AS THE FIRST OF THE WAR VETERANS IT WAS RUMORED THAT HE SURPRISED VIDA BY COMING UNANNOUNCED THAT VIDA FAINTED WHEN SHE SAW HIM AND FOR A NIGHT AND DAY
THE FARMERS CAME INTO TOWN IN HOME MADE SLEIGHS WITH BED QUILTS AND HAY PILED IN THE ROUGH BOXES FUR COATS FUR CAPS FUR MITTENS OVERSHOES BUCKLING ALMOST TO THE KNEES GRAY KNITTED SCARFS TEN FEET LONG THICK WOOLEN SOCKS
CANVAS JACKETS LINED WITH FLUFFY YELLOW WOOL LIKE THE PLUMAGE OF DUCKLINGS MOCCASINS RED FLANNEL WRISTLETS FOR THE BLAZING CHAPPED WRISTS OF BOYS THESE PROTECTIONS AGAINST WINTER WERE BUSILY DUG OUT OF MOTH BALL SPRINKLED DRAWERS
THERE WERE AS MANY DISTINCTIONS IN WRAPS AS IN MOTOR CARS THE LESSER SORT APPEARED IN YELLOW AND BLACK DOGSKIN COATS BUT KENNICOTT WAS LORDLY IN A LONG RACCOON ULSTER AND A NEW SEAL CAP WHEN THE SNOW WAS TOO DEEP FOR HIS MOTOR
HE CALLED BOTH LYMAN CASS THE MILLER AND THE FINN HOMESTEADER FROM LOST LAKE BY THEIR FIRST NAMES HE WAS KNOWN AS THE RED SWEDE AND CONSIDERED SLIGHTLY INSANE BJORNSTAM COULD DO ANYTHING WITH HIS HANDS SOLDER A PAN
BUT SHE WAS BETRAYED BY HER FAILURE TO GLOW OVER THE BOOSTING KENNICOTT BELIEVED IN IT DEMANDED THAT SHE SAY PATRIOTIC THINGS ABOUT THE WHITE WAY AND THE NEW FACTORY HE SNORTED BY GOLLY I'VE DONE ALL I COULD
AND FOUND THE COARSE TOBACCO STAINED UNIMAGINATIVE OLD MAN LYING ON THE SNOW OF THE GRAVE HIS THICK ARMS SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE RAW MOUND AS IF TO PROTECT HER FROM THE COLD HER
AND I WAS GLAD TO LEARN ABOUT IT SEEMS THAT THE GEAR LEVER IN THE KUTZ IS AN INCH LONGER EVEN THIS CHRONICLE OF VOYAGES HARRY INTERRUPTED WITH REMARKS ON THE ADVANTAGES OF THE BALL GEAR SHIFT KENNICOTT GAVE UP HOPE OF ADEQUATE CREDIT FOR BEING A TRAVELED MAN
I'M TIRED OF PLAYING TRAIN LET'S PLAY SOMETHING ELSE LET'S GO SEE AUNTIE BOGART OH NO
I THINK WE'D BETTER WALK PROBABLY MAKE BETTER TIME AND I'M JUST CRAZY TO SEE MY BABY WITH THEIR SUIT CASES THEY WADDLED ON THEIR COATS WERE SOAKED THROUGH CAROL HAD FORGOTTEN HER
THE WIDOW ROBBING DEACON OF FICTION CAN'T HELP BEING HYPOCRITICAL THE WIDOWS THEMSELVES DEMAND IT THEY ADMIRE HIS UNCTUOUSNESS AND LOOK AT ME SUPPOSE I DID DARE TO MAKE LOVE TO SOME EXQUISITE MARRIED WOMAN I WOULDN'T ADMIT IT TO MYSELF
HE STALKED TO HER TOOK HER UNRESPONSIVE HAND CAROL YOU HAVE BEEN HAPPY HERE TONIGHT YES I'M BEGGING SHE SQUEEZED HIS HAND QUICKLY THEN SNATCHED HERS AWAY SHE HAD BUT LITTLE OF THE CURIOSITY OF THE FLIRT
WHILE KENNICOTT SEESAWED ON HIS TOES AND CHUCKLED WONDER WHAT HUGH'LL SAY WHEN HE SEES US
STORM SHEDS WERE ERECTED AT EVERY DOOR IN EVERY BLOCK THE HOUSEHOLDERS SAM CLARK THE WEALTHY MISTER DAWSON ALL SAVE ASTHMATIC EZRA STOWBODY WHO EXTRAVAGANTLY HIRED A BOY
AND THE NEW ARRIVALS IN THIS STRANGE LAND FOUND IT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO REALIZE THAT THERE WERE MANY CREATURES AROUND THEM WHO WERE INVISIBLE YET COULD BE HEARD PLAINLY SHALL I WIND HIM UP ASKED BETSY FEELING VERY SORRY FOR TIK TOK
MERCY KIND ENEMIES MERCY SPARE US AND WE WILL BE YOUR SLAVES FOREVER THE OTHER OFFICERS WHO HAD NOW ADVANCED INTO THE CLEARING LIKEWISE FELL UPON THEIR KNEES AND BEGGED FOR MERCY
I WILL ADMIT THEY ARE VERY PRETTY AT FIRST SIGHT ONE CANNOT FAIL TO ADMIRE THEM AS WELL AS THE RICH JEWELS SCATTERED BENEATH THEM
THIS NOME KING IS REALLY A POWERFUL FELLOW AND HAS A LEGION OF NOMES TO ASSIST HIM WHEREAS OUR BOLD QUEEN COMMANDS A CLOCKWORK MAN AND A BAND OF FAINT HEARTED OFFICERS
WHAT CAN ALL THIS MEAN FOR ANSWER QUEEN ANN SAILED UP FROM THE TUBE TOOK A RIDE THROUGH THE AIR AS HIGH AS THE TREETOPS AND ALIGHTED SQUARELY ON TOP OF THE PECULIAR PERSON'S HEAD SMASHING A JEWELED CROWN OVER HIS EYES AND TUMBLING HIM TO THE GROUND
AND FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR THEY CONTINUED THEIR FEARFUL JOURNEY THEN JUST AS THEY BEGAN TO FEAR THE TUBE WOULD NEVER END TIK TOK POPPED OUT INTO BROAD DAYLIGHT AND AFTER MAKING A GRACEFUL CIRCLE IN THE AIR FELL WITH A SPLASH INTO A GREAT MARBLE FOUNTAIN
IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO DEPRIVE THE WORLD OF SUCH A CLEVER CONTRIVANCE
AND THE SKIN OF ONE ARM WAS BRIGHT YELLOW AND THE SKIN OF THE OTHER ARM A VIVID GREEN HE HAD ONE BLUE LEG AND ONE PINK ONE WHILE BOTH HIS FEET WHICH SHOWED THROUGH THE OPEN SANDALS HE WORE WERE JET BLACK
AND PERHAPS A LITTLE NERVOUS FOR THEY COULD NOT BE KILLED EVEN THOUGH RUGGEDO MIGHT CAUSE THEM MUCH SUFFERING AND PERHAPS DESTROY THEM UTTERLY BUT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED BETSY AND HANK TO GO ALONE INTO THE CAVERNS THE LITTLE GIRL IS MORTAL
AND HE CAST AN EVIL LOOK AT THE OTHER PRISONERS AND SAID NEVER MIND THE GIRL AND THE DONKEY HERE ARE FOUR AT LEAST WHO CANNOT ESCAPE MY VENGEANCE LET ME SEE I BELIEVE I'LL CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT TIK TOK
RENDERED DESPERATE BY THEIR SAD CONDITION THE OFFICERS EXHIBITED COURAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THEY LEFT HOME
SAID THE UGLY ONE IN A VOICE OF DESPAIR WHY NOT BROTHER ASKED SHAGGY ANXIOUSLY DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO ME CAME THE ANSWER THROUGH THE CLOSED DOOR NO TELL ME BROTHER WHAT HAVE THEY DONE
AS QUEEN ANN REACHED THE PLACE AND BEHELD HER KNEELING ARMY PERMIT US TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES REPLIED SHAGGY STEPPING FORWARD THIS IS TIK TOK THE CLOCKWORK MAN WHO WORKS BETTER THAN SOME MEAT PEOPLE
NO AGREED FILES THAT IS A FACT BUT IF MY OFFICERS WILL KINDLY COMMAND ME TO CONQUER YOU
NOR WAS HANK THERE IS NO ONE IN THE SLIMY CAVE YOUR MAJESTY
TIK TOK TACKLES A TOUGH TASK WHILE SHAGGY AND HIS COMPANIONS STOOD HUDDLED IN A GROUP AT ONE SIDE THE ARMY OF OOGABOO WAS APPROACHING ALONG THE PATHWAY THE TRAMP OF THEIR FEET BEING NOW AND THEN ACCOMPANIED BY A DISMAL GROAN
WE DON'T KNOW YOUR MAJESTY WAS THE REPLY BUT THIS IS ABSURD SAID ANN WITH A FROWN IF WE CAN'T GET TO RUGGEDO
THE SOCIETY OF SUCH A WICKED MONSTER AS YOU YOU FORGET RETORTED THE KING SCOWLING DARKLY THAT YOU ALSO ARE IN MY POWER NOT SO RUGGEDO
THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER IS BEYOND THE REACH OF YOUR SPITE OR MALICE
HER HIS HANDS MET IN AIR AND NOW THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER WAS IN ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM AS SMILING AND COMPOSED AS BEFORE
AT THAT TIME YOU HAD NO GUN SAID POLYCHROME
SHE NOW TURNED TO THE OFFICERS AND SAID I MUST ASK YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR I KNOW IT IS UNDIGNIFIED IN OFFICERS TO FIGHT BUT UNLESS YOU IMMEDIATELY CAPTURE PRIVATE FILES AND FORCE HIM TO OBEY MY ORDERS THERE WILL BE NO PLUNDER FOR ANY OF US
YOU CAN SOON BRING THE NOME KING TO REASON SO IT WAS DECIDED TO WAIT NO LONGER SHAGGY WALKED THROUGH THE ENTRANCE FIRST AND AFTER HIM CAME THE OTHERS THEY HAD NO THOUGHT OF DANGER TO THEMSELVES
AS HE OWNS THE LOVE MAGNET I THINK I'LL TRANSFORM HIM INTO A DOVE AND THEN WE CAN PRACTICE SHOOTING AT HIM WITH TIK TOK'S GUN
WITH A PAIR OF SCISSORS BEING FREED THE DOVE QUICKLY FLEW UPWARD
HE SAID AND THEN HIS COPPER JAWS CLICKED TOGETHER AND HE COULD SAY NO MORE HE NEXT MADE AN ATTEMPT TO WALK BUT AFTER SEVERAL AWKWARD TRIALS FOUND HE COULD NOT MOVE HIS JOINTS PEALS OF JEERING LAUGHTER FROM PERSONS UNSEEN GREETED TIK TOK'S FAILURE
HERE'S ANOTHER OF THEM TUBEKINS LYING IN THE WATER OF THE FOUNTAIN GRACIOUS CRIED BETSY IT MUST BE TIK TOK AND HE'LL DROWN WATER IS A BAD THING FOR HIS CLOCKWORKS ANYWAY AGREED SHAGGY AS WITH ONE ACCORD THEY ALL STARTED FOR THE FOUNTAIN
HE WORE A ROBE OF SCARLET WHICH DID NOT COVER HIS ARMS AND EXTENDED NO LOWER THAN HIS BARE KNEES ON THE BOSOM OF THE ROBE WAS EMBROIDERED A TERRIBLE DRAGON'S HEAD AS HORRIBLE TO LOOK AT AS THE MAN WAS BEAUTIFUL HIS ARMS AND LEGS WERE LEFT BARE
THAT THE OFFICERS BEGAN WHISPERING TOGETHER AND PRESENTLY COLONEL CHEESE SAID YOUR MAJESTY BY COMBINING OUR BRAINS WE HAVE JUST EVOLVED A MOST BRILLIANT IDEA WE WILL MAKE THE CLOCKWORK MAN THE PRIVATE SOLDIER WHO ME ASKED TIK TOK
WHICH SWUNG BACK AND FORTH DURING THE SWIFT JOURNEY AND POMMELED EVERYONE WITHIN THEIR REACH NOW FOLLOWED QUEEN ANN WHO HAD STRUCK THE TUBE IN A SITTING POSITION AND WENT FLYING ALONG WITH A DASH AND ABANDON THAT THOROUGHLY BEWILDERED THE POOR LADY
KALIKO WENT AWAY LOOKING SAD AND DISTURBED FOR HE KNEW THE KING WAS CRUEL AND UNJUST ENOUGH TO CARRY OUT THIS THREAT
SAID COLONEL PLUM EAGERLY THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF BRAVERY AND ONE CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO POSSESS THEM ALL
THE OTHER HALF IS DIVIDED AMONG THE OFFICERS AND THE PRIVATE GETS THE REST
INQUIRED MAJOR STOCKINGS IN AN ANXIOUS VOICE OF COURSE ANSWERED SHAGGY HE OWNS ALL THE METAL THAT LIES UNDERGROUND GOLD SILVER COPPER BRASS AND TIN
BUT IF IT SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY AND THE MAGIC WORKED THE MAGICIAN WOULD BE SEVERELY PUNISHED WHEN POLYCHROME SAW SHAGGY MAN TRANSFORMED INTO A DOVE
WAS MUCH SURPRISED WHEN A ROPE SHOT OUT FROM THE DARKNESS AND TWINED AROUND HIS BODY
QUITE SMOOTHLY AND HIS JOINTS WORKED FAIRLY WELL COME COMMANDED TUBEKINS AND TURNING HIS BACK UPON THEM HE WALKED UP THE PATH TOWARD THE CASTLE SHALL WE GO ASKED QUEEN ANN UNCERTAINLY
I WONDER WHAT IS THE BEST AND SUREST WAY TO WAKEN A DRAGON
EXCLAIMED THE LITTLE GIRL BE PATIENT AND YOU'LL FIND OUT MY DEAR SAID POLYCHROME BUT ISN'T THIS AN ODD EXPERIENCE HERE AM I WHOSE HOME IS IN THE SKIES MAKING A JOURNEY THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE EARTH
WHEN FIRST THEY TUMBLED INTO THE TUBE ALL WERE TOO DAZED TO THINK CLEARLY BUT THE TRIP WAS A LONG ONE BECAUSE THE CAVITY LED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE EARTH TO A PLACE JUST OPPOSITE THE NOME KING'S DOMINIONS AND LONG BEFORE THE ADVENTURERS GOT TO THE END
BECAUSE ALL TUBES ARE MADE THAT WAY BUT THIS TUBE IS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND EVERYONE IS FORBIDDEN TO FALL INTO IT WE DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE EXPLAINED BETSY AND POLYCHROME ADDED I AM QUITE SURE THAT RUGGEDO THE NOME KING PUSHED US DOWN THAT TUBE HA
HAVE THE GOLD CRUCIBLE HEATED TO A WHITE SEETHING HEAT AND THEN WE'LL DUMP THE COPPER MAN INTO IT AND MELT HIM UP BUT YOUR MAJESTY PROTESTED KALIKO WHO HAD RETURNED TO THE ROOM AFTER SENDING A HUNDRED NOMES TO SEARCH FOR THE OOGABOO PEOPLE
WHO HAD SHAKEN OFF THE GRASP OF THE OFFICERS WITHOUT EFFORT AND WAS NOW TRYING TO PULL THE BATTERED CROWN FROM OFF HIS EYES SHAGGY WHO WAS ALWAYS POLITE HELPED HIM TO DO THIS AND WHEN THE MAN WAS FREE AND COULD SEE AGAIN HE LOOKED AT HIS VISITORS WITH EVIDENT AMAZEMENT
AND PICKED UP THEIR DISCARDED SWORDS PRIVATE FILES SEIZE AND BIND THESE PRISONERS SCREAMED THE QUEEN NO SAID FILES THROWING DOWN HIS GUN AND REMOVING THE KNAPSACK WHICH WAS STRAPPED TO HIS BACK I RESIGN MY POSITION AS THE ARMY OF OOGABOO
THE MULE NOW DASHED FORWARD AND BEGAN BACKING UPON THE OFFICERS AND KICKING FIERCE AND DANGEROUS HEELS AT THEM THE ATTACK WAS SO SUDDEN THAT THE OFFICERS SCATTERED LIKE DUST IN A WHIRLWIND
PERHAPS YOU'LL KNOW HIM BY THAT THE ONLY PERSON WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS CAVERN SAID ANN HAS RUN AWAY FROM US WHENEVER WE APPROACHED HIM HE HIDES OVER YONDER AMONG THE TREES THAT ARE NOT GOLD AND WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CATCH SIGHT OF HIS FACE
THEN YOU ARE ENEMIES OF RUGGEDO
YOU WILL CARRY THE GUN THAT MISTER FILES USED A SOL DIER MUST BE A BLE TO RUN AS WELL AS TO FIGHT PROTESTED TIK TOK
THERE IS BUT ONE SLIMY CAVE AND THERE IS NO ONE IN IT RETURNED PANG POSITIVELY RUGGEDO WAS BEGINNING TO BE ALARMED AS WELL AS ANGRY HOWEVER THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT MADE HIM THE MORE VINDICTIVE
THEY THREW THEMSELVES UPON HIM AND HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN CAPTURING HIM WHEN THEIR FELLOW ADVENTURERS REACHED THE SPOT GOODNESS GRACIOUS CRIED BETSY WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU ALL
AND THERE WAS NO MORE TALK ABOUT CONQUERING AND BINDING ANY OF HIS PARTY IF YOU INSIST ON CONQUERING ANYONE SAID SHAGGY YOU MAY MARCH WITH ME TO THE UNDERGROUND KINGDOM OF RUGGEDO TO CONQUER THE WORLD AS YOU HAVE SET OUT TO DO
SO AFTER A TIME THEY ABANDONED THE CHASE AND RUGGEDO RETURNED TO HIS THRONE AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FACE WITH A FINELY WOVEN HANDKERCHIEF OF CLOTH OF GOLD WELL SAID POLYCHROME WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO NOW
THEN SINCE THEY ARE NOW HELPLESS WHY NOT RELEASE THEM AND SEND THEM BACK TO THE EARTH'S SURFACE BECAUSE I HATE EM AND MEAN TO MAKE EM SUFFER FOR THEIR INVASION BUT I'LL MAKE A BARGAIN WITH YOU SWEET POLLY REMAIN HERE AND LIVE WITH ME
AND EACH FLOWER HEAD WAS FIRMLY SET UPON ITS SLENDER BUT STOUT STEM THERE WERE EVEN A FEW WILD ROSES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE SIGHT OF THESE THAT GAVE THE PRINCESS COURAGE TO ASK THE IMPORTANT QUESTION SHE DROPPED TO HER KNEES FACING THE FLOWERS
NOT FOR A SIN GLE SEC OND I CAN NOT FIGHT
BUT HANK ONLY UTTERED A PLAINTIVE HEE HAW FOR IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OBEY AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES HAD PASSED AND NO HARM HAD BEFALLEN THEM BETSY GAINED COURAGE SHE COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL
AND UNLESS RUGGEDO'S EYES BEHELD THE TALISMAN IT COULD NOT AFFECT HIM AS FOR BETSY BOBBIN AND HER MULE HE BELIEVED KALIKO HAD PLACED THEM IN THE SLIMY CAVE WHILE ANN AND HER OFFICERS HE THOUGHT SAFELY IMPRISONED IN THE PIT
AS IF TO ASSIST HIM A STRONG CURRENT OF WARM AIR WAS DIRECTED AGAINST THE COPPER MAN WHICH QUICKLY DRIED HIM SOON HE WAS ABLE TO SAY
BY AND BY A NOISE SOUNDED FROM WITHIN THE HUT ARE YOU READY ASKED SHAGGY YES BROTHER CAME THE REPLY AND THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN TO ALLOW THE UGLY ONE TO STEP FORTH BETSY MIGHT HAVE LAUGHED ALOUD
THEN SHE TURNED TO SHAGGY AND ASKED ARE YOU SURE HE HASN'T SEEN THE LOVE MAGNET I'M POSITIVE ANSWERED SHAGGY BUT YOU SEEM TO BE SOMETHING OF A LOVE MAGNET YOURSELF POLYCHROME SHE LAUGHED AGAIN AND SAID TO RUGGEDO
INSTEAD OF ENJOYING ALL THESE GLITTERY GOLDEN ONES ASKED BETSY BECAUSE HE FINDS FOOD AMONG THE NATURAL TREES REPLIED KALIKO AND I REMEMBER THAT HE HAS BUILT A LITTLE HOUSE THERE TO SLEEP IN AS FOR THESE GLITTERY GOLDEN TREES
ROARED THE KING I'M GETTING TIRED OF YOU KALIKO AND THE FIRST THING YOU KNOW I'LL TURN YOU INTO A POTATO AND MAKE SARATOGA CHIPS OF YOU THE NEXT TO CONSIDER HE ADDED MORE MILDLY IS THE SHAGGY MAN
AND MY OFFICERS ARE UNABLE TO FIGHT THEY ARE EXCEPTIONALLY BRAVE IN COMMANDING OTHERS TO FIGHT BUT COULD NOT THEMSELVES MEET THE ENEMY AND CONQUER
PERHAPS RUGGEDO HIMSELF MIGHT BREAK HIS OWN ENCHANTMENT SUGGESTED ANN BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE ALLOWED THE OLD KING TO ESCAPE NEVER MIND MY DEAR BROTHER SAID SHAGGY CONSOLINGLY I AM VERY HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND YOU AGAIN
THEY ALL STOOD LOOKING FROM ONE ROAD TO ANOTHER IN PERPLEXITY THE PATHS RADIATED FROM THE LITTLE CLEARING LIKE THE RAYS OF THE MIDDAY SUN AND EACH PATH SEEMED LIKE ALL THE OTHERS FILES AND THE ROSE PRINCESS WHO HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME GOOD FRIENDS
AND WHEN SHE LOOKED AROUND HER SHE SAW THE QUEEN AND THE PECULIAR PERSON STRUGGLING TOGETHER UPON THE GROUND WHERE THE MAN WAS TRYING TO CHOKE ANN AND SHE HAD BOTH HANDS IN HIS BUSHY HAIR AND WAS PULLING WITH ALL HER MIGHT SOME OF THE OFFICERS WHEN THEY GOT UPON THEIR FEET
SHE MAY BECOME MORE MODEST IN HER AMBITIONS WHERE IS THE DRAGON NOW INQUIRED OZGA UP THERE ON THE ROCKS REPLIED FILES
THERE IS NO COAST HERE WAS THE REPLY
AND POSSESSES NO MAGIC POWERS WHATEVER
HE CAME OUT OF HIS THRONE TO STAND BEFORE THE SHAGGY MAN AND THEN HE WAVED HIS HANDS PALMS DOWNWARD IN SEVEN SEMICIRCLES OVER HIS VICTIM'S HEAD SAYING IN A LOW BUT CLEAR TONE OF VOICE THE MAGIC WUGWA
AND RUGGEDO EVEN CAME DOWN FROM HIS THRONE TO ASSIST HIS GENERAL BUT NEVER COULD THEY LAY HANDS UPON THE LOVELY SKY FAIRY WHO FLITTED HERE AND THERE WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHT AND CONSTANTLY DEFIED THEM WITH HER MERRY LAUGHTER AS SHE EVADED THEIR EFFORTS
KALIKO RETURNED TO THE CAVERN IN TIME TO OVERHEAR THIS QUESTION AND BEING A LOYAL NOME AND EAGER TO SERVE HIS KING HE ANSWERED BY SAYING IF WE CAN MANAGE TO BIND THE SHAGGY MAN'S ARMS TIGHT TO HIS BODY
AND HE ADDED THAT AFTER WE HAD GOTTEN INTO TROUBLE HE WOULD WAKE UP AND CONQUER THE NOME KING IN A JIFFY AS HIS MASTER THE JINJIN HAS ORDERED HIM TO DO QUOX MEANS WELL SAID SHAGGY BUT I DO NOT THINK WE SHALL NEED HIS SERVICES
THIS SPEECH OF SHAGGY MAN'S WAS OVERHEARD BY THE LONG EARED HEARER
AND BOWED TO RUGGEDO THEY'RE ALL GONE SAID HE
I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN TO REPAY ME FOR ALL MY BOTHER REPLIED THE NOME KING THEN HE SAID TO KALIKO SUMMON THE EXECUTIONERS KALIKO AT ONCE WITHDREW AND PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH A SCORE OF NOMES
IN THE HANDS OF THE OFFICERS OF OOGABOO A DOZEN OF WHOM WERE CLINGING TO THE OLD NOME AND HOLDING HIM FAST IN SPITE OF HIS EFFORTS TO ESCAPE THERE ALSO WAS QUEEN ANN LOOKING GRIMLY UPON THE SCENE OF STRIFE BUT WHEN SHE OBSERVED HER FORMER COMPANIONS APPROACHING
AND EVEN HER SHOES WERE SO CUT AND SLASHED THAT THEY WERE READY TO FALL FROM HER FEET THE OFFICERS HAD FARED SOMEWHAT WORSE THAN THEIR LEADER FOR HOLES WERE WORN IN THE KNEES OF THEIR TROUSERS WHILE SHARP POINTS OF ROCK IN THE ROOF AND SIDES OF THE TUNNEL
WAKE UP QUOX SHE CRIED IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO ACT BUT QUOX DID NOT WAKE UP HE LAY AS ONE IN A TRANCE ABSOLUTELY MOTIONLESS WITH HIS ENORMOUS EYES TIGHT CLOSED
THEN IT CLOSED AGAIN DON'T FORGET A HOLE FOR YOUR NOSE CRIED BETSY YOU MUST BREATHE YOU KNOW FOR A TIME THERE WAS SILENCE
RUGGEDO DID YOU SAY RUGGEDO CRIED THE MAN BECOMING MUCH EXCITED THAT IS WHAT SHE SAID REPLIED SHAGGY AND I BELIEVE SHE IS RIGHT
BUT THE GENERALS NOW SHOUTED FORWARD AND BIND THE PRISONERS AND THE COLONELS AND MAJORS AND CAPTAINS REPEATED THE COMMAND YELLING IT AS LOUD AS THEY COULD ALL THIS NOISE ANNOYED HANK WHO HAD BEEN EYEING THE ARMY OF OOGABOO WITH STRONG DISFAVOR
AND ARE OBSTRUCTING OUR JOURNEY IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO CONQUER YOU UNWORTHY THOUGH YOU MAY BE OF SUCH HIGH HONOR THAT'S ALL RIGHT REPLIED SHAGGY CONQUER US AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE WE DON'T MIND BUT WE WON'T BE ANYBODY'S SLAVES
AS TIK TOK HAS TO DO EVERYTHING IN HIS SLOW MECHANICAL WAY DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY ARE LIKELY TO FAIL ASKED THE ROSE PRINCESS I DO INDEED REPLIED SHAGGY
WELL REPLIED RUGGEDO I LIKE YOU THE OTHERS I HATE I HATE EVERYBODY BUT YOU WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO LIVE ALWAYS IN THIS BEAUTIFUL CAVERN POLYCHROME SEE THE JEWELS THAT STUD THE WALLS HAVE EVERY TINT AND COLOR OF YOUR RAINBOW
COULDN'T YOU MANAGE TO FALL ALL BY YOURSELF MY DEAR I'LL TRY LAUGHED THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER ALL THIS TIME THEY WERE SWIFTLY FALLING THROUGH THE TUBE AND IT WAS NOT SO EASY FOR THEM TO TALK AS YOU MAY IMAGINE WHEN YOU READ THEIR WORDS
IN A MILD AND SYMPATHETIC TONE OF VOICE
BUT JUST THEN SHE RECEIVED A SHOVE THAT ALMOST PITCHED HER FORWARD ON HER HEAD SO SHE DECIDED TO GO THE OFFICERS WHO HESITATED RECEIVED SEVERAL ENERGETIC KICKS BUT COULD NOT SEE WHO DELIVERED THEM THEREFORE THEY ALSO DECIDED VERY WISELY TO GO
AS SOON AS SHE SAW THAT TROUBLE HAD OVERTAKEN SHAGGY SHE TURNED AND RAN LIGHTLY BACK THROUGH THE PASSAGE AND OUT OF THE ENTRANCE
ALL OF WHOM WERE NEARLY AS EVIL LOOKING AS THEIR HATED MASTER THEY BORE GREAT GOLDEN PINCERS AND PRODS OF SILVER AND CLAMPS AND CHAINS AND VARIOUS WICKED LOOKING INSTRUMENTS
AND HIS SILVER SCALES THEN DESPAIRING AT LAST OF WAKENING THE BEAST AND WORRIED OVER THE FATE OF HER FRIENDS POLYCHROME AGAIN RAN DOWN TO THE ENTRANCE AND HURRIED ALONG THE PASSAGE INTO THE NOME KING'S CAVERN HERE SHE FOUND RUGGEDO
OF COURSE SAID FILES THE FIELD FLOWERS MUST BE SECOND COUSINS TO A ROSE PRINCESS AND I BELIEVE IF YOU ASK THEM THEY WILL TELL YOU SHE LOOKED MORE CLOSELY AT THE FLOWERS THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF WHITE DAISIES GOLDEN BUTTERCUPS BLUEBELLS AND DAFFODILS GROWING BY THE ROADSIDE
AND ARRANGED HIS WHISKERS ON MY WORD SAID HE YOU ARE A VERY CAPTIVATING CREATURE MOREOVER I PERCEIVE YOU ARE A FAIRY I AM POLYCHROME THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER SHE SAID PROUDLY
BUT SOON THEY GAINED COURAGE TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THE PECULIAR PERSON AS HE WAS A TYPE OF ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY LAND WHOM THEY AFTERWARD MET I WILL TRY TO TELL YOU WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE HIS FACE WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT LACKED EXPRESSION
I BELIEVE THE MAGICIAN WAS GOING THE OTHER WAY AND PROBABLY HE WENT MUCH FASTER THAN WE ARE GOING IT'S FAST ENOUGH TO SUIT ME REMARKED SHAGGY GENTLY REMOVING POLYCHROME'S HEEL FROM HIS LEFT EYE
I AM SURE SHE WAS RIGHT WAILED THE PRISONER BUT RUGGEDO WANTED TO INJURE ME TO MAKE ME UGLY IN THE EYES OF ALL THE WORLD SO HE PERFORMED A WICKED ENCHANTMENT I WENT TO BED BEAUTIFUL OR YOU MIGHT SAY HANDSOME TO BE VERY MODEST
AND POLYCHROME DANCED WITH GLEE BUT ANN WAS FURIOUS AT THIS IGNOBLE DEFEAT OF HER GALLANT FORCES BY ONE SMALL MULE PRIVATE FILES I COMMAND YOU TO DO YOUR DUTY SHE CRIED AGAIN
AND THAT TIK TOK WOULD SOON BE MELTED IN A CRUCIBLE
AS ONE OF THE OFFICERS STEPPED ON A SHARP STONE OR KNOCKED HIS FUNNYBONE AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR'S SWORD HANDLE THEN OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES MARCHED PRIVATE FILES BEARING THE BANNER OF OOGABOO WHICH FLUTTERED FROM A LONG POLE
BUT I AND MY COMPANIONS WOULD LIKE THE ASSISTANCE OF YOUR ARMY AND IF YOU HELP US TO CONQUER RUGGEDO AND TO RESCUE MY BROTHER FROM CAPTIVITY WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO KEEP ALL THE GOLD AND JEWELS AND OTHER PLUNDER YOU MAY FIND THIS PROSPECT WAS SO TEMPTING
ALSO THEY HOPED THEY HAD SEEN THE LAST OF THE DEGRADED KING I'M AWFUL GLAD HE'S GONE SAID BETSY SIGHING DEEPLY IF HE DOESN'T GET RECKLESS AND SPEND HIS WEALTH FOOLISHLY HE'S GOT ENOUGH TO START A BANK WHEN HE GETS TO OKLAHOMA BUT MY BROTHER
NO ONE SAID PANG THE COVER WAS THERE BUT THE PRISONERS WERE NOT UNDER IT IN THAT CASE SNARLED THE KING
ADVANCED A LITTLE WAY ALONG ONE OF THE ROADS AND FOUND THAT IT WAS BORDERED BY PRETTY WILD FLOWERS WHY DON'T YOU ASK THE FLOWERS TO TELL YOU THE WAY HE SAID TO HIS COMPANION THE FLOWERS RETURNED THE PRINCESS SURPRISED AT THE QUESTION
AND TURN ALL THE HATRED IN HIS HEART INTO LOVE RUGGEDO WAS PROUD OF HIS HATRED AND ABHORRED LOVE OF ANY SORT REALLY SAID HE
WHILE TWO SMALLER ONES BEFORE THE NOSTRILS ALLOWED THE MAN TO BREATHE FREELY THE CLOTH WAS THEN TIGHTLY DRAWN OVER THE UGLY ONE'S FACE AND KNOTTED AT THE BACK OF HIS NECK HE WAS DRESSED IN CLOTHES THAT HAD ONCE BEEN GOOD BUT NOW WERE SADLY WORN AND FRAYED
I KNOW AND I'LL GO AS SOON AS I HAVE FILLED MY POCKETS SAID RUGGEDO MEEKLY THEN FILL THEM AND BE GONE RETURNED THE NEW KING RUGGEDO OBEYED STOOPING DOWN HE BEGAN GATHERING UP JEWELS BY THE HANDFUL
THEY BECOME PRETTY TAME I BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE DECLARED SHAGGY MY DEAR BROTHER IS VERY WISE TO PREFER REAL TREES TO THE IMITATION ONES BUT COME LET US GO THERE AND FIND HIM SHAGGY STARTED FOR THE GREEN GROVE AT ONCE
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE ONE OF YOUR OFFICERS THE PRIVATE ASKED SHAGGY BUT AT ONCE EVERY OFFICER BEGAN TO PROTEST AND THE QUEEN OF OOGABOO SHOOK HER HEAD AS SHE REPLIED THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE A PRIVATE SOLDIER MUST BE A TERRIBLE FIGHTER
THEY HAD BEGUN TO RECOVER THEIR WITS THIS IS AWFUL HANK CRIED BETSY IN A LOUD VOICE AND QUEEN ANN HEARD HER AND CALLED OUT
THAT IS INDEED TRUE REPLIED SHAGGY
NO ONE CAN RESCUE ME NOW OH BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN ABOUT THAT SAID SHAGGY THERE IS A NEW KING OF THE NOMES NAMED KALIKO IN RUGGEDO'S PLACE AND HE HAS PROMISED YOU SHALL GO FREE FREE I DARE NOT GO FREE
SO THAT HE COULD NOT ATTACK THEIR QUEEN AGAIN BY THIS TIME SHAGGY POLYCHROME
HIS SILK STOCKINGS HAD HOLES IN THEM AND HIS SHOES WERE STUB TOED AND NEEDED BLACKENING BUT WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT WHISPERED BETSY WHEN THE POOR MAN HAS BEEN A PRISONER FOR SO MANY YEARS SHAGGY HAD DARTED FORWARD
ALL MADE OF PRECIOUS METALS AND SET WITH DIAMONDS AND RUBIES NOW PANG SAID RUGGEDO ADDRESSING THE LEADER OF THE EXECUTIONERS FETCH THE ARMY OF OOGABOO AND THEIR QUEEN FROM THE PIT AND TORTURE THEM HERE IN MY PRESENCE
THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER LAUGHED MERRILY AND SO INFECTIOUS WAS THIS JOYOUS LAUGH THAT BETSY ECHOED IT
BUT I BEG YOU NOW TO COME FORTH AND FACE US WHO ARE YOUR FRIENDS NONE HERE WILL LAUGH OR JEER HOWEVER UNHANDSOME YOU MAY BE NO INDEED THEY ALL ADDED PLEADINGLY BUT THE UGLY ONE REFUSED THE INVITATION
AND PLEASE DON'T ASK ME WHY EITHER WHY SAID BETSY NO ONE CAN TELL WHERE WE ARE GOING UNTIL WE GET THERE REPLIED SHAGGY AND THEN HE YELLED OUCH FOR POLYCHROME HAD OVERTAKEN HIM AND WAS NOW SITTING ON HIS HEAD
YELLED THE GENERALS DRAWING THEIR SWORDS
I WILL MERELY CLAIM THAT I WAS GOOD LOOKING AND I WAKENED THE NEXT MORNING THE HOMELIEST MAN IN ALL THE WORLD I AM SO REPULSIVE THAT WHEN I LOOK IN A MIRROR I FRIGHTEN MYSELF POOR BROTHER SAID SHAGGY SOFTLY
THE NOME KING THINKING HIMSELF WHOLLY MASTER OF THE SITUATION WAS LAUGHING AND JEERING AT HIS PRISONERS WHEN POLYCHROME EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL AND DANCING LIKE A RAY OF LIGHT ENTERED THE CAVERN OHO CRIED THE KING A
AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED HIM BEING CURIOUS TO WITNESS THE FINAL RESCUE OF HIS LONG SOUGHT LONG LOST BROTHER
ONE BY ONE HE HAD MET THE INVADERS AND EASILY CAPTURED THEM THE DREADED LOVE MAGNET WAS INDEED IN SHAGGY'S POCKET ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY FROM THE KING BUT SHAGGY WAS POWERLESS TO SHOW IT
THERE WAS TIK TOK FLAT UPON HIS BACK AND SLIDING HEADFOREMOST DOWN THE INCLINE AND THERE WERE THE OFFICERS OF THE ARMY OF OOGABOO ALL TANGLED UP IN A CONFUSED CROWD FLAPPING THEIR ARMS AND TRYING TO SHIELD THEIR FACES FROM THE CLANKING SWORDS
AND WERE CURIOUSLY EXAMINING THE STRANGE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES
HE COULD NOT GET THE LOVE MAGNET OUT OF HIS POCKET TRUE CRIED THE KING IN DELIGHT AT THIS EASY SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM GET AT ONCE A DOZEN NOMES WITH ROPES AND PLACE THEM IN THE PASSAGE WHERE THEY CAN SEIZE AND BIND SHAGGY AS SOON AS HE ENTERS
ONCE BETSY'S HEELS FLEW UP AND STRUCK A SIMILAR SUBSTANCE OVERHEAD THEY WERE INDEED DESCENDING THE HOLLOW TUBE THAT LED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD STOP HANK STOP CRIED THE GIRL
AND HE REFUSES TO COME OUT OF THAT HOUSE AND FACE US I'LL TELL YOU REPLIED BETSY LET HIM PUT ON A MASK THE VERY IDEA I WAS SEEKING EXCLAIMED SHAGGY JOYFULLY AND THEN HE CALLED OUT BROTHER
OFFICERS GIVE THE COMMAND TO MARCH
THE EFFECT OF THIS WELL KNOWN SORCERY WAS INSTANTANEOUS INSTEAD OF THE SHAGGY MAN A PRETTY DOVE LAY FLUTTERING UPON THE FLOOR ITS WINGS CONFINED BY TINY CORDS WOUND AROUND THEM
GONE WHERE THEY LEFT NO ADDRESS YOUR MAJESTY BUT THEY ARE NOT IN THE PIT
PERHAPS A MORE UNHAPPY AND HOMESICK LOT OF CONQUERORS NEVER EXISTED THAN THIS BAND FROM OOGABOO AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF WANDERING IN THEIR MARVELOUS PRISON THEY WERE FRIGHTENED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT RUGGEDO HAD COME AMONG THEM
BEHOLD THE UGLY ONE BUT WHEN THE NOMES SAW MY FACE THEY ALL FELL TO LAUGHING AND JEERING WHICH PREVENTED THEM FROM WORKING AT THEIR TASKS SEEING THIS RUGGEDO BECAME ANGRY AND PUSHED ME INTO A TUNNEL
SHE PICKED UP A PIECE OF ROCK AND POUNDED AGAINST HIS EYELIDS WITH IT SAYING WAKE UP QUOX WAKE UP BUT HE WOULD NOT WAKEN DEAR ME HOW UNFORTUNATE SIGHED THE LOVELY RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER
AND THAT'S ENOUGH TOO SAID FILES DO I GET A SALARY INQUIRED TIK TOK YOU GET YOUR SHARE OF THE PLUNDER ANSWERED THE QUEEN YES REMARKED FILES ONE HALF OF THE PLUNDER GOES TO QUEEN ANN
BUT BEFORE THEY COULD REACH IT INVISIBLE HANDS RAISED TIK TOK FROM THE MARBLE BASIN AND SET HIM UPON HIS FEET BESIDE IT WATER DRIPPING FROM EVERY JOINT OF HIS COPPER BODY
AND THEY ARE NOT SO ELUSIVE I'LL HAVE FRESH DEWDROPS GATHERED FOR YOUR FEASTING EVERY DAY
EXAMINED THEM WITH MUCH CURIOSITY THEN DISCOVERING THAT THREE OF THE PARTY WERE GIRLS HE LIFTED HIS CAP AND MADE A POLITE BOW
THAT MUST BE MY DEAR BROTHER EXCLAIMED SHAGGY YES IT MUST BE ASSENTED KALIKO NO ONE ELSE INHABITS THIS SPLENDID DOME SO THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE BUT WHY DOES HE HIDE AMONG THOSE GREEN TREES
SHE TURNED AWAY IN A SHAMEFACED MANNER FOR ANN AND HER OFFICERS WERE INDEED A SIGHT TO BEHOLD HER MAJESTY'S CLOTHING ONCE SO RICH AND GORGEOUS WAS NOW WORN AND TORN INTO SHREDS BY HER LONG CRAWL THROUGH THE TUNNEL WHICH BY THE WAY
AND HERE IS PRINCESS OZGA OF ROSELAND JUST NOW UNFORTUNATELY EXILED FROM HER KINGDOM OF ROSES I NEXT PRESENT POLYCHROME A SKY FAIRY WHO LOST HER BOW BY AN ACCIDENT AND CAN'T FIND HER WAY HOME
THAT IS A KINDLY DEED REPLIED UGLY IN A SAD VOICE BUT I DREAD TO GO BACK TO THE WORLD IN THIS DIREFUL CONDITION UNLESS I REMAIN FOREVER MASKED MY DREADFUL FACE WOULD CURDLE ALL THE MILK AND STOP ALL THE CLOCKS
RUGGEDO HAD NO FEAR OF FILES OR OZGA BUT TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE HE HAD ORDERED GOLDEN HANDCUFFS PLACED UPON THEIR WRISTS THESE DID NOT CAUSE THEM ANY GREAT ANNOYANCE BUT PREVENTED THEM FROM MAKING AN ATTACK HAD THEY BEEN INCLINED TO DO SO
SHOULDER YOUR GUN AND STAND READY TO MARCH ADVISED FILES SO TIK TOK HELD THE GUN STRAIGHT AND STOOD STILL WHAT NEXT HE ASKED THE QUEEN TURNED TO SHAGGY WHICH ROAD LEADS TO THE METAL MONARCH'S CAVERN
RUBBING HIS HANDS GLEEFULLY TOGETHER ONE ENEMY IS OUT OF MY WAY AND NOW FOR THE OTHERS PERHAPS MY READERS SHOULD BE WARNED NOT TO ATTEMPT THE ABOVE TRANSFORMATION FOR
AS WELL AS IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR FRIENDS IT WILL BE GREAT SPORT I HEAR YOUR MAJESTY AND I OBEY YOUR MAJESTY ANSWERED PANG AND WENT WITH HIS NOMES INTO THE PASSAGE IN A FEW MINUTES HE RETURNED
AND ALL THE OTHERS WERE SILENT FROM SYMPATHY I WAS SO ASHAMED OF MY LOOKS CONTINUED THE VOICE OF SHAGGY'S BROTHER THAT I TRIED TO HIDE BUT THE CRUEL KING RUGGEDO FORCED ME TO APPEAR BEFORE ALL THE LEGION OF NOMES TO WHOM HE SAID
SAID TIK TOK PICKING UP THE GUN AND EXAMINING IT WONDERINGLY FOR HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SUCH A WEAPON THEN ANN STRAPPED THE KNAPSACK TO TIK TOK'S COPPER BACK AND SAID NOW WE ARE READY TO MARCH TO RUGGEDO'S KINGDOM AND CONQUER IT
CLEVERLY MADE OF TWIGS AND GOLDEN BRANCHES WOVEN TOGETHER AS THEY APPROACHED THE PLACE THEY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A FORM THAT DARTED INTO THE HUT AND SLAMMED THE DOOR TIGHT SHUT AFTER HIM SHAGGY MAN RAN TO THE DOOR AND CRIED ALOUD BROTHER
NO THANK YOU LAUGHED POLYCHROME MY HOME IS IN THE SKY AND I'M ONLY ON A VISIT TO THIS SOLID SORDID EARTH BUT TELL ME RUGGEDO WHY MY FRIENDS HAVE BEEN WOUND WITH CORDS AND BOUND WITH CHAINS
I CANNOT SAID HE INDEED I CANNOT FACE STRANGERS UGLY AS I AM SHAGGY MAN TURNED TO THE GROUP SURROUNDING HIM WHAT SHALL I DO HE ASKED IN SORROWFUL TONES I CANNOT LEAVE MY DEAR BROTHER HERE
CAN'T THE ENCHANTMENT BE BROKEN IN SOME WAY INQUIRED BETSY SHAGGY LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT KALIKO WHO SHOOK HIS HEAD I AM SURE I CAN'T BREAK THE ENCHANTMENT HE SAID RUGGEDO WAS FOND OF MAGIC AND LEARNED A GOOD MANY ENCHANTMENTS THAT WE NOMES KNOW NOTHING OF
QUITE DISCONCERTED BY THIS UNEXPECTED EFFECT OF THE MAGNET SHAGGY DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM THE QUEEN'S ENCIRCLING ARMS AND QUICKLY HID THE TALISMAN IN HIS POCKET THE ADVENTURERS FROM OOGABOO WERE NOW HIS FIRM FRIENDS
SAID ANN SCORNFULLY A PRETTY LOT OF VAGABONDS YOU ARE INDEED ALL LOST OR STRAYED I SUPPOSE AND NOT WORTH A QUEEN'S PLUNDERING I'M SORRY I'VE CONQUERED YOU BUT YOU HAVEN'T CONQUERED US YET CALLED BETSY INDIGNANTLY
SAID GENERAL CONE MUSTERING COURAGE TO ADVANCE TO THE WELL BUT JUST THEN HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF TIK TOK AND SHAGGY AND AT ONCE FELL UPON HIS KNEES TREMBLING AND FRIGHTENED AND CRIED OUT
AND CONVERSE MORE AT OUR EASE THE OFFICERS HAD BY THIS TIME RISEN FROM THEIR KNEES AND BRUSHED THE DUST FROM THEIR TROUSERS TO THEM THE ENEMY DID NOT LOOK VERY FIERCE SO THE GENERALS AND COLONELS AND MAJORS AND CAPTAINS GAINED COURAGE TO FACE THEM
WHO HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER THEN A LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY BUT UNSEEN BY THE OTHERS IN THE INKY DARKNESS SLID BETSY AND HANK WHILE BEHIND THEM WERE SHAGGY AND POLYCHROME AND FINALLY FILES AND THE PRINCESS
ALTHOUGH I MAY NEVER SEE YOUR FACE SO LET US MAKE THE MOST OF THIS JOYFUL REUNION THE UGLY ONE WAS AFFECTED TO TEARS BY THIS TENDER SPEECH AND THE TEARS BEGAN TO WET THE RED HANDKERCHIEF
AND STAGGERED DOWN THE PATH BY THE WAY HE HAD COME THEY LET HIM DEPART IN SILENCE FOR WITH ALL HE HAD TAKEN THE MASSES OF JEWELS UPON THE GROUND
HAD LED HER DIRECTLY INTO THE METAL FOREST IT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE THREE SECRET PASSAGES AND BY FAR THE MOST DIFFICULT OF THE THREE ANN HAD NOT ONLY TORN HER PRETTY SKIRT AND JACKET BUT HER CROWN HAD BECOME BENT AND BATTERED
PUT A MASK OVER YOUR FACE AND THEN NONE OF US CAN SEE WHAT YOUR FEATURES ARE LIKE I HAVE NO MASK ANSWERED THE UGLY ONE LOOK HERE SAID BETSY HE CAN USE MY HANDKERCHIEF SHAGGY LOOKED AT THE LITTLE SQUARE OF CLOTH AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
HAD RECOVERED FROM HANK'S KICK AND HAD PICKED THEMSELVES UP THEIR FIRST ACT WAS TO TURN TIK TOK ON HIS BACK AND PUT A HEAVY DIAMOND ON TOP OF HIM SO THAT HE COULD NOT GET UP AGAIN THEN THEY CAREFULLY PUT HIS GUN IN A CORNER OF THE CAVERN
BUT FILES AND THE PRINCESS FOLLOWED ON AFTER SHAGGY DETERMINED NOT TO DESERT THEIR FRIEND AND HOPING THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ARISE TO RESCUE HIM AS FOR POLYCHROME
AND RUGGEDO PRESENTED A COMICAL SIGHT FOR SURELY NO MAN EVER BEFORE HAD SO MANY POCKETS OR ANY AT ALL FILLED WITH SUCH A CHOICE COLLECTION OF PRECIOUS STONES HE NEGLECTED TO THANK THE YOUNG LADIES FOR THEIR KINDNESS BUT GAVE THEM A SURLY NOD OF FAREWELL
I ENLISTED TO FIGHT THE ENEMY AND BECOME A HERO BUT IF YOU WANT SOME ONE TO BIND HARMLESS GIRLS YOU WILL HAVE TO HIRE ANOTHER PRIVATE THEN HE WALKED OVER TO THE OTHERS AND SHOOK HANDS WITH SHAGGY AND TIK TOK
BUT AS HE HAD NO PLACE TO GO HE STOOD BY AND FACED HIS FORMER SERVANT WHO WAS NOW KING IN HIS PLACE IN A HUMBLE AND PLEADING MANNER
SHOUTED THE MAJORS DRAWING THEIR SWORDS FALL IN BAWLED THE CAPTAINS DRAWING THEIR SWORDS
CAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HIM AT ALL BUT WE STARTED OUT TO CONQUER HIM WHICH ISN'T AS FRIENDLY AS IT MIGHT BE TRUE AGREED THE MAN HE LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY FROM ONE TO ANOTHER OF THEM FOR A WHILE
FOR HANK MADE NO DISTINCTION IN FAVOR OF A LADY WHO WAS AN OPEN ENEMY BETSY GRABBED HER CHAMPION BY THE FORELOCK HOWEVER AND SO HELD HIM FAST AND WHEN THE OFFICERS SAW THAT THE MULE WAS RESTRAINED FROM FURTHER ATTACKS THEY CREPT FEARFULLY BACK
CRIED THE COLONELS DRAWING THEIR SWORDS
FOR JUST AS SOON AS I AM SATISFIED THAT QUEEN ANN AND HER ARMY HAVE FAILED TO CONQUER RUGGEDO I SHALL ENTER THE CAVERNS AND SHOW THE KING MY LOVE MAGNET THAT HE CANNOT RESIST THEREFORE THE CONQUEST WILL BE MADE WITH EASE
REPLIED POLYCHROME I HAVE OFTEN HEARD OF THIS PASSAGE WHICH WAS ONCE BUILT BY A MAGICIAN WHO WAS A GREAT TRAVELER HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SAVE HIM THE BOTHER OF GOING AROUND THE EARTH'S SURFACE BUT HE TUMBLED THROUGH THE TUBE SO FAST
IT WAS A LOVELY PLACE INDEED AND SEEMED TO BE THE GARDEN OF SOME GREAT PRINCE FOR THROUGH THE VISTAS OF TREES AND SHRUBBERY COULD BE SEEN THE TOWERS OF AN IMMENSE CASTLE BUT AS YET THE ONLY INHABITANT TO GREET THEM WAS THE PECULIAR PERSON JUST MENTIONED
THIS POLE HE STUCK IN THE GROUND JUST IN FRONT OF THE WELL AND THEN HE CRIED IN A LOUD VOICE I HEREBY CONQUER THIS TERRITORY IN THE NAME OF QUEEN ANN SOFORTH OF OOGABOO
HAD MADE RAGS OF EVERY INCH OF THEIR ONCE BRILLIANT UNIFORMS A MORE TATTERED AND WOEFUL ARMY NEVER CAME OUT OF A BATTLE THAN THESE HARMLESS VICTIMS OF THE ROCKY PASSAGE BUT IT HAD SEEMED THEIR ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM THE CRUEL NOME KING
CLOSING THE ROCK ENTRANCE SO THAT I COULD NOT GET OUT I FOLLOWED THE LENGTH OF THE TUNNEL UNTIL I REACHED THIS HUGE DOME WHERE THE MARVELOUS METAL FOREST STANDS AND HERE I HAVE REMAINED EVER SINCE POOR BROTHER REPEATED SHAGGY
WHERE I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE CENTER OF THE EARTH ASKED BETSY HER VOICE TREMBLING A LITTLE THROUGH NERVOUSNESS WHY
THE EYELIDS HAD BIG SILVER SCALES ON THEM LIKE ALL THE REST OF HIS BODY POLYCHROME MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT QUOX WAS DEAD HAD SHE NOT KNOWN THAT DRAGONS DO NOT DIE EASILY
THE OFFICERS THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE TURNED A CORNER SO THEY KEPT ON THEIR WAY AND ALL OF THEM LIKEWISE DISAPPEARED ONE AFTER ANOTHER QUEEN ANN WAS RATHER SURPRISED AT THIS AND IN HASTENING FORWARD TO LEARN THE REASON SHE ALSO VANISHED FROM SIGHT
AND RANGED BEFORE THE KING WERE THE ROSE PRINCESS FILES AND THE SHAGGY MAN TIK TOK STILL LAY UPON THE FLOOR WEIGHTED DOWN BY THE BIG DIAMOND RUGGEDO WAS NOW IN A MORE CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE NOME KING TO BE HIS MASTER AND WAS READY TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS THEREFORE HE REPEATED SHAGGY'S SPEECH TO THE KING WHO AT ONCE REALIZED THAT HIS KINGDOM WAS IN GRAVE DANGER
HOW COULD ANYONE BE SAFE WHEN SHE'S GOING ABOUT SIXTY MILES A MINUTE THEN AFTER A PAUSE SHE ADDED BUT WHERE DO YOU S'POSE WE'RE GOING TO YOUR MAJ'STY DON'T ASK HER THAT PLEASE DON'T SAID SHAGGY WHO WAS NOT TOO FAR AWAY TO OVERHEAR THEM
THE MULE WAS HEAVIER AND HAD BETSY CLINGING TO HIS BACK SO HE DID NOT GO SO HIGH UP FORTUNATELY FOR HIS LITTLE RIDER HE STRUCK THE GROUND UPON HIS FOUR FEET BETSY WAS JARRED A TRIFLE BUT NOT HURT
TIK TOK IS THE ONLY ONE OF OUR PARTY FITTED TO UNDERTAKE THE JOB WHAT MUST I DO ASKED TIK TOK OBEY ORDERS REPLIED ANN WHEN THE OFFICERS COMMAND YOU TO DO ANYTHING YOU MUST DO IT THAT IS ALL
ALTHOUGH THE EXACT MAGICAL FORMULA HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IT IS UNLAWFUL IN ALL CIVILIZED COUNTRIES FOR ANYONE TO TRANSFORM A PERSON INTO A DOVE BY MUTTERING THE WORDS RUGGEDO USED THERE WERE NO LAWS TO PREVENT THE NOME KING FROM PERFORMING THIS TRANSFORMATION
AND THE BEAUTIFUL ROSE PRINCESS AND SHOOK HIS HEAD IT WOULD BE IMPOLITE AND I WON'T DO IT HE ASSERTED YOU MUST CRIED ANN IT IS YOUR DUTY TO OBEY ORDERS I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY ORDERS FROM MY OFFICERS OBJECTED THE PRIVATE
AND I'LL SET ALL THESE PEOPLE FREE YOU SHALL BE MY DAUGHTER OR MY WIFE OR MY AUNT OR GRANDMOTHER WHICHEVER YOU LIKE ONLY STAY HERE TO BRIGHTEN MY GLOOMY KINGDOM AND MAKE ME HAPPY POLYCHROME LOOKED AT HIM WONDERINGLY
SHE WALKED AROUND QUOX TWO OR THREE TIMES TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME TENDER PLACE ON HIS BODY WHERE A THUMP OR A PUNCH MIGHT BE FELT BUT HE LAY EXTENDED ALONG THE ROCKS WITH HIS CHIN FLAT UPON THE GROUND AND HIS LEGS DRAWN UNDERNEATH HIS BODY
ANSWERED THE MARQUIS HOW MUCH DO I OWE THIS GRACIOUS PRINCE WHAT IS THERE I WOULD NOT DO TO EVINCE MY EARNEST GRATITUDE THAT IS RIGHT CRIED THE MARQUISE I LOVE TO SEE YOU THUS
BUT THE GENTLE VOICE WHICH USUALLY HAS SUCH POWER OVER ME FAILS TO CONVINCE ME TO DAY I FEEL THE SAME AS REGARDS YOURSELF SAID VALENTINE AND I OWN THAT IF YOU HAVE NO STRONGER PROOF TO GIVE ME I HAVE ANOTHER REPLIED MAXIMILIAN
ON WHOM I SHALL REVENGE MYSELF I ASSURE YOU FOR ALL I HAVE SUFFERED DURING THE LAST MONTH NOW I REPEAT BEAUCHAMP I WISH TO RETURN TO HUMAN AND MATERIAL EXISTENCE AND IF YOU ARE STILL THE FRIEND YOU PROFESS TO BE
WHAT PULL AS BEAUCHAMP SAYS HAVE I YOU GREAT PEOPLE ALWAYS LOSE SOMETHING BY SCANDAL NOTWITHSTANDING YOUR MILLIONS COME WHO IS MY FATHER I CAME TO TELL YOU AH CRIED BENEDETTO HIS EYES SPARKLING WITH JOY
IF YOUR DAUGHTER HAD COMMITTED ONLY ONE CRIME AND I SAW HER MEDITATING ANOTHER I WOULD SAY WARN HER PUNISH HER LET HER PASS THE REMAINDER OF HER LIFE IN A CONVENT WEEPING AND PRAYING
THE OLD MAN LOOKED AT HER FOR AN INSTANT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF THE DEEPEST TENDERNESS THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE NOTARY HE SIGNIFICANTLY WINKED HIS EYE IN TOKEN OF DISSENT WHAT SAID THE NOTARY
YES SAID VALENTINE HE WAS VERY FOND OF ME WHO DOES NOT LOVE YOU VALENTINE SMILED SADLY WHAT ARE YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S SYMPTOMS AN EXTREME NERVOUS EXCITEMENT AND A STRANGELY AGITATED SLEEP
FOR A DECLARATION TO BE AVAILABLE SHOULD BE MADE BEFORE THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES HE THEN TOOK VILLEFORT'S ARM
THERE ARE AT LEAST FEW THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN SAID THE COUNT COLDLY AND YOU TOOK PLEASURE IN BEHOLDING THESE DREADFUL SPECTACLES MY FIRST SENTIMENT WAS HORROR THE SECOND INDIFFERENCE THE THIRD CURIOSITY
BUT FOR YOU IN THE WORDS OF THE GOSPEL SEEK AND YOU SHALL FIND I HAVE FOUND ALREADY WHAT I WOULD STAB THE MAN BUT THE WOMAN TOLD ME THAT IF ANY MISFORTUNE HAPPENED TO HER BETROTHED SHE WOULD KILL HERSELF
FOR HE HAS DONE FOR US WHAT HE GRANTS ONLY TO HIS CHOSEN HE SENT US ONE OF HIS ANGELS
HE ORDERED THE CARRIAGE THEREFORE FOR ELEVEN O'CLOCK DESIRING SIGNOR PASTRINI TO INFORM HIM THE MOMENT THAT ALBERT RETURNED TO THE HOTEL AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ALBERT HAD NOT COME BACK FRANZ DRESSED HIMSELF AND WENT OUT TELLING HIS HOST
I CONSIDER MYSELF AS BRAVE AS MOST MEN BUT WHEN I DREW FROM MY BREAST THE LITTLE KEY OF THE STAIRCASE WHICH I HAD FOUND IN MY COAT THAT LITTLE KEY WE BOTH USED TO CHERISH SO MUCH WHICH YOU WISHED TO HAVE FASTENED TO A GOLDEN RING
OH SPEAK SPEAK DOCTOR I SHALL HAVE COURAGE WELL SIR YOU HAVE IN YOUR ESTABLISHMENT OR IN YOUR FAMILY PERHAPS ONE OF THE FRIGHTFUL MONSTROSITIES OF WHICH EACH CENTURY PRODUCES ONLY ONE
AND SIGNED TO THEM TO GET OUT OF THE WAY THE CRIMINAL STROVE TO RISE BUT ERE HE HAD TIME THE MACE FELL ON HIS LEFT TEMPLE A DULL AND HEAVY SOUND WAS HEARD AND THE MAN DROPPED LIKE AN OX ON HIS FACE
EVERY ARTICLE OF DRESS HAT COAT GLOVES AND BOOTS WAS FROM THE FIRST MAKERS HE SEEMED SCARCELY FIVE AND THIRTY
DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS THE DOOR WAS OPENED WIDE ENOUGH TO ADMIT HER AND WHEN SHE HAD PASSED THROUGH IT WAS AGAIN SHUT WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF HER FOR AN INSTANT THE CONCIERGE TOOK A WHISTLE FROM HIS POCKET AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE COURT AND BLEW IT
ANOTHER KIND OF RECREATION IN WHICH A HANDKERCHIEF IS FILLED WITH SAND PEBBLES
I RECOLLECT COMING FOR MY MOTHER TO LOOK AT IT WHEN M DE SAINT MERAN ADVERTISED IT FOR SALE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO
HE TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE SOUP WHICH THE JAILER HAD BROUGHT ROSE STAGGERED TOWARDS IT RAISED THE VESSEL TO HIS LIPS AND DRANK OFF THE CONTENTS WITH A FEELING OF INDESCRIBABLE PLEASURE
THE NOTARY HERE DESCENDED AND VALENTINE WAS INFORMED THAT HER GRANDMOTHER WAS ALONE GO UPSTAIRS SHE SAID TO THE DOCTOR AND YOU OH I DARE NOT SHE FORBADE MY SENDING FOR YOU AND
I MUST ASCERTAIN IF YOUR INSINUATIONS ARE JUST AND AM GOING NOW TO INQUIRE OF THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
BUT NOT FOR THE SURVIVOR ON THE CONTRARY
IT IS WELL SIR REPLIED VILLEFORT FROM BELOW IT IS WELL HAVE PATIENCE BUT ONE DAY LONGER WHAT I HAVE SAID I WILL DO NOIRTIER SEEMED TO BE CALMED BY THESE WORDS
FROM THE REMARKS WE HAVE QUOTED FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE ANY EFFECT TO THE INTEREST HE HAD FELT AS WE HAVE SAID
AND BEEN MORE BITTER THAN EVER AGAINST THE MINISTRY RE ENTERED HIS CARRIAGE
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF ASKED THE ABBE SMILINGLY IMPUTING THE DEEP ABSTRACTION IN WHICH HIS VISITOR WAS PLUNGED TO THE EXCESS OF HIS AWE AND WONDER I WAS REFLECTING IN THE FIRST PLACE REPLIED DANTES
REALLY THIS IS TOO ABSURD SAID VILLEFORT EXCUSE ME SIR REPLIED THE NOTARY ON THE CONTRARY THE MEANING OF M NOIRTIER IS QUITE EVIDENT TO ME AND I CAN QUITE EASILY CONNECT THE TRAIN OF IDEAS PASSING IN HIS MIND
IT WAS ONE OF THESE HE HAD UNCOVERED AND WHICH HE MUST REMOVE FROM ITS SOCKET DANTES STROVE TO DO THIS WITH HIS NAILS BUT THEY WERE TOO WEAK THE FRAGMENTS OF THE JUG BROKE AND AFTER AN HOUR OF USELESS TOIL HE PAUSED
WHAT HAS HE DONE ASKED ALBERT OH NOTHING WORTH SPEAKING OF
WILD EYES
WE ARE RICH WITH FORTY FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS WE CAN LIVE LIKE PRINCESSES FOR TWO YEARS AND COMFORTABLY FOR FOUR BUT BEFORE SIX MONTHS YOU WITH YOUR MUSIC AND I WITH MY VOICE
WHY HOW COULD YOU MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE SUCH AN OLD STAGER
FOR THE WEARER TRIED HIS BEST TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW COAT HE BESTOWED THE SAME ATTENTION UPON THE CAMBRIC FRONT OF A SHIRT WHICH HAD CONSIDERABLY CHANGED IN COLOR SINCE HIS ENTRANCE INTO THE PRISON
WELL MONSIEUR I AM AT YOUR SERVICE
WITH THE WHIRL OF THE WALTZ AND GALOP WHILE BRILLIANT STREAMS OF LIGHT SHONE THROUGH THE OPENINGS OF THE VENETIAN BLINDS AT THIS MOMENT THE GARDEN WAS ONLY OCCUPIED BY ABOUT TEN SERVANTS WHO HAD JUST RECEIVED ORDERS FROM THEIR MISTRESS TO PREPARE THE SUPPER
HAVE I NOT HEARD TALK OF SOME STRANGE ADVENTURE WITH BANDITS OR THIEVES HID IN RUINS AND OF HIS HAVING HAD A MIRACULOUS ESCAPE I FORGET HOW BUT I KNOW HE USED TO AMUSE MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER BY TELLING THEM ABOUT IT AFTER HIS RETURN FROM ITALY
NOW M DANGLARS ASK THESE GENTLEMEN WHERE THEY ARE CAUGHT STERLETS SAID CHATEAU RENAUD ARE ONLY FOUND IN THE VOLGA AND SAID CAVALCANTI I KNOW THAT LAKE FUSARO ALONE SUPPLIES LAMPREYS OF THAT SIZE
TURNING TO M DE VILLEFORT YES SAID THE PROCUREUR AND I THINK THE WILL PROMISES TO BE YET MORE EXTRAORDINARY FOR I CANNOT SEE HOW IT IS TO BE DRAWN UP WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF VALENTINE
AND THAT EXPLAINS HOW IT COMES TO PASS THAT FALLEN AS I TRUST HE IS FOREVER NAPOLEON HAS STILL RETAINED A TRAIN OF PARASITICAL SATELLITES
TELL YOUR COACHMAN TO STOP AT THE DOOR YOU WILL PRESENT MY EXCUSES TO THE MARQUISE AND MADEMOISELLE RENEE WHOM I LEAVE ON SUCH A DAY WITH GREAT REGRET YOU WILL FIND THEM BOTH HERE AND CAN MAKE YOUR FAREWELLS IN PERSON A THOUSAND THANKS AND NOW FOR THE LETTER
KITCHENS OF COURSE COMPLETE ONES AND COOKS EXCELLENT WELL A FOWL FISH GAME IT SIGNIFIES LITTLE SO THAT I EAT AS YOUR EXCELLENCY PLEASES YOU MENTIONED A FOWL I THINK YES A FOWL
FOR EXCEPT MYSELF THESE ROOMS WOULD NOT HOLD A SHADOW MORE
WAS ORDERED TO REMAIN AT MARTIGUES TIS WELL I WISH YOU TO WRITE FROM TIME TO TIME TO THE CAPTAINS IN CHARGE OF THE TWO VESSELS SO AS TO KEEP THEM ON THE ALERT
MY SENSES ARE CONFUSED AND DURING THE LAST HOUR THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT THOUGHTS HAVE PASSED THROUGH MY BRAIN OH IF YOU REFUSE MY ADVICE WHAT DO YOU ADVISE SAID VALENTINE RAISING HER EYES TO HEAVEN AND SIGHING I AM FREE
AND THE COUNTESS WAS SO MUCH IN UNISON WITH HIS OWN PERSONAL DISQUIETUDE I INFORMED THEM AT THE HOTEL THAT I HAD THE HONOR OF PASSING THE NIGHT HERE DUKE SAID FRANZ AND DESIRED THEM TO COME AND INFORM ME OF HIS RETURN AH
I MOTIVES OF HATRED AGAINST DANTES NONE ON MY WORD I SAW YOU WERE UNHAPPY AND YOUR UNHAPPINESS INTERESTED ME THAT'S ALL BUT SINCE YOU BELIEVE I ACT FOR MY OWN ACCOUNT ADIEU MY DEAR FRIEND GET OUT OF THE AFFAIR AS BEST YOU MAY
AS WHEN DEATH RELAXES ITS VIGILANCE OVER THEM FOR A MOMENT IN ORDER TO STRIKE SOME OTHER OLD PERSON THEN WHILE MADAME DE SAINT MERAN REMAINED ON HER KNEES PRAYING FERVENTLY
OBSERVED THE YOUNG ARISTOCRAT IT WAS ONLY TO FIGHT AS AN AMATEUR
BUT SUCH AS WE ARE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED BITTER SORROWS AND GOD HAS POURED BALM INTO YOUR WOUNDS AS HE DOES INTO THOSE OF ALL WHO ARE IN AFFLICTION SAID MONTE CRISTO INQUIRINGLY YES COUNT RETURNED JULIE WE MAY INDEED SAY HE HAS
IT IS NO REASON BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT SEEN AN EXECUTION AT PARIS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SEE ONE ANYWHERE ELSE WHEN YOU TRAVEL IT IS TO SEE EVERYTHING
YES COUNT HAVE YOU BROUGHT IT HERE IT IS VERY WELL AND WHERE IS THIS HOUSE THAT I PURCHASE ASKED THE COUNT CARELESSLY ADDRESSING HIMSELF HALF TO BERTUCCIO HALF TO THE NOTARY
LENT YOU ONE OF MY CARRIAGES
RAYS OF LIGHT WERE VISIBLE THE COUNT LAID HIS HAND ON FRANZ'S SHOULDER WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A CAMP OF BANDITS IN REPOSE HE INQUIRED EXCEEDINGLY REPLIED FRANZ COME WITH ME THEN PEPPINO PUT OUT THE TORCH PEPPINO OBEYED
AND HAVING TEN MINUTES BEFORE ME AND MY STRAWBERRIES BEING RIPE WHEN A DAY LONGER BY THE BY SIR DO YOU THINK DORMICE EAT THEM INDEED I SHOULD THINK NOT REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
HIS NEW VALET BROUGHT HIM THE PAPERS AND WITH THEM A CUP OF CHOCOLATE WHAT ARE YOU BRINGING ME SAID HE A CUP OF CHOCOLATE I DID NOT ASK FOR IT WHO HAS PAID ME THIS ATTENTION
WHO ARE HUNG UP TO THE YARD ARM HE WOULD NOT DIE BY WHAT SEEMED AN INFAMOUS DEATH HE RESOLVED TO ADOPT THE SECOND AND BEGAN THAT DAY TO CARRY OUT HIS RESOLVE NEARLY FOUR YEARS HAD PASSED AWAY
SHOWING TO THE YOUNG MAN A SLENDER STICK ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG AND MUCH RESEMBLING THE SIZE OF THE HANDLE OF A FINE PAINTING BRUSH TO THE END OF WHICH WAS TIED BY A PIECE OF THREAD
EACH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY TWO PRIESTS NEITHER HAD HIS EYES BANDAGED PEPPINO WALKED WITH A FIRM STEP DOUBTLESS AWARE OF WHAT AWAITED HIM ANDREA WAS SUPPORTED BY TWO PRIESTS EACH OF THEM FROM TIME TO TIME KISSED THE CRUCIFIX
I SHOULD NOT SEE HIM THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN I COULD NOT REPEAT THE SIGNALS AND THEN NOT HAVING REPEATED THEM THROUGH NEGLIGENCE I SHOULD BE FINED HOW MUCH
YOU SENT FOR ME HE SAID TO THE PRISONER ARE YOU SIR
THEIR DEMAND WAS FAIR AND THE CHIEF INCLINED HIS HEAD IN SIGN OF ACQUIESCENCE THE EYES OF ALL SHONE FIERCELY AS THEY MADE THEIR DEMAND AND THE RED LIGHT OF THE FIRE MADE THEM LOOK LIKE DEMONS THE NAMES OF ALL INCLUDING CARLINI WERE PLACED IN A HAT
AND HER GLANCE WAS TURNED TOWARDS HEAVEN
THE HOUSE ALI HAD CHOSEN AND WHICH WAS TO SERVE AS A TOWN RESIDENCE TO MONTE CRISTO
WHO HEARING NO NEWS OF HER LOVER HAD COME UNOBSERVED TO INQUIRE AFTER HIM
OH DO NOT GIVE ME CREDIT FOR THIS MADAME IT WAS DONE BY THE ROMANS WHO MUCH ESTEEMED THEM AND PLINY RELATES THAT THEY SENT SLAVES FROM OSTIA TO ROME WHO CARRIED ON THEIR HEADS FISH WHICH HE CALLS THE MULUS AND WHICH FROM THE DESCRIPTION MUST PROBABLY BE THE GOLDFISH
AND HAD GONE TO BED AND TO SLEEP SHE CALLED THE MAID AND QUESTIONED HER MADEMOISELLE EUGENIE SAID THE MAID
COME WHO IS MY FATHER I CAME TO TELL YOU AH CRIED BENEDETTO HIS EYES SPARKLING WITH JOY JUST THEN THE DOOR OPENED
AMONGST WHICH HE HAD CAREFULLY ARRANGED IN CHARACTERS ONLY KNOWN TO HIMSELF THE NAMES OF ALL THOSE WHO EITHER IN HIS POLITICAL CAREER IN MONEY MATTERS AT THE BAR OR IN HIS MYSTERIOUS LOVE AFFAIRS HAD BECOME HIS ENEMIES
YES SAID DANGLARS TAKING IT FROM BEYOND HIS REACH AND AS WHAT I SAY AND DO IS MERELY IN JEST AND I AMONGST THE FIRST AND FOREMOST SHOULD BE SORRY IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO DANTES THE WORTHY DANTES LOOK HERE
THAT OF NAPOLEON ON THE COLUMN OF THE PLACE VENDOME THE ONLY DIFFERENCE CONSISTS IN THE OPPOSITE CHARACTER OF THE EQUALITY ADVOCATED BY THESE TWO MEN ONE IS THE EQUALITY THAT ELEVATES THE OTHER IS THE EQUALITY THAT DEGRADES
FROM THE CARRIAGE TO THE PORT THE TWO GENDARMES WHO WERE OPPOSITE TO HIM DESCENDED FIRST THEN HE WAS ORDERED TO ALIGHT AND THE GENDARMES ON EACH SIDE OF HIM FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS A BOAT WHICH A CUSTOM HOUSE OFFICER
THEN IT IS TO YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT THIS LETTER IS ADDRESSED IS THERE ANY ANSWER INQUIRED FRANZ TAKING THE LETTER FROM HIM YES YOUR FRIEND AT LEAST HOPES SO COME UP STAIRS WITH ME AND I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU
WOMAN SIREN THAT YOU ARE
BUT CONTINUED SHE LORD WILMORE HAD A FAMILY OR FRIENDS HE MUST HAVE KNOWN SOME ONE CAN WE NOT OH IT IS USELESS TO INQUIRE RETURNED THE COUNT PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE WAS NOT THE MAN YOU SEEK FOR
TERESA WAS SIXTEEN AND VAMPA SEVENTEEN
HOW CAN A YOUNG MAN LIVE UPON FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH BUT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE YOUNG MAN SHOULD WANT A FEW THOUSANDS MORE DO NOT ADVANCE IT THE FATHER WILL NEVER REPAY IT
HEROIC ACTION INTERRUPTED CHATEAU RENAUD I WAS CHOSEN BUT THAT IS NOT ALL
WELL LISTEN MORCERF AH BEAUCHAMP I SEE YOU KNOW SOMETHING ALREADY YOU WILL RESTORE ME TO LIFE I DO NOT SAY THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU BUT IT IS AT LEAST A RAY OF LIGHT IN A DARK NIGHT
I RAN TO THE HOSPITAL AND LEARNED THAT THE SAME NIGHT THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER A CHILD HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE WRAPPED IN PART OF A FINE LINEN NAPKIN PURPOSELY TORN IN HALF THIS PORTION OF THE NAPKIN WAS MARKED WITH HALF A BARON'S CROWN
I DO NOT THINK IT IS A MOMENT TO GIVE WAY TO USELESS SORROW
HOW DO YOU DO MY DEAR SON SAID THE MAJOR GRAVELY AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF PAINFUL SEPARATION SAID ANDREA IN THE SAME TONE OF VOICE AND GLANCING TOWARDS THE DOOR WHAT A HAPPINESS IT IS TO MEET AGAIN
DO YOU WISH TO ASSASSINATE A MAN WHO IN THE EYES OF HEAVEN IS A BROTHER OH MY FORMER FRIENDS MY FORMER FRIENDS HE MURMURED AND FELL WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND THEN RISING IN DESPAIR HE EXCLAIMED THE CHIEF THE CHIEF
YES YOU IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT ME SINCE YOU INTEREST YOURSELF IN MY AFFAIRS I THINK IT IS NOW MY TURN TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS AH TRUE
AFTER HAVING DEPRIVED ME OF MY LIBERTY AFTER HAVING DEPRIVED ME OF DEATH AFTER HAVING RECALLED ME TO EXISTENCE MY GOD HAVE PITY ON ME AND DO NOT LET ME DIE IN DESPAIR
WHO CAME TO TELL HIM THAT THE TRAVELLING CARRIAGE WAS IN READINESS
CERTAINLY AND THE NEXT MOMENT
I RETREATED WITH THE REST FOR EIGHT AND FORTY HOURS I ENDURED THE RAIN DURING THE DAY AND THE COLD DURING THE NIGHT TOLERABLY WELL
YOU MAY DEPEND UPON ME TO FIND YOU A FITTING DWELLING HERE
THEN IN THAT CASE I SHALL ALWAYS CHOOSE TO REMAIN THERE YOU CANNOT CONTROL CIRCUMSTANCES MY DEAR SIR MAN PROPOSES AND GOD DISPOSES ANDREA SIGHED BUT SAID HE
SIGNOR PASTRINI DID AS HE WAS DESIRED AND RETURNING FIVE MINUTES AFTER HE SAID THE COUNT AWAITS YOUR EXCELLENCY FRANZ WENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR AND A SERVANT INTRODUCED HIM TO THE COUNT HE WAS IN A SMALL ROOM WHICH FRANZ HAD NOT YET SEEN
SAID THE BARONESS SPEAK TO ME NOT AS A MAGISTRATE BUT AS A FRIEND AND WHEN I AM IN BITTER ANGUISH OF SPIRIT DO NOT TELL ME THAT I OUGHT TO BE GAY VILLEFORT BOWED WHEN I HEAR MISFORTUNES NAMED MADAME
I RECOLLECT THAT AT ROME YOU SAID SOMETHING OF A PROJECTED MARRIAGE MAY I CONGRATULATE YOU
A MAGNIFICENT PEACH WAS HANGING AGAINST AN ADJOINING WALL RIPENED BY THE SAME ARTIFICIAL HEAT MERCEDES DREW NEAR AND PLUCKED THE FRUIT TAKE THIS PEACH THEN SHE SAID THE COUNT AGAIN REFUSED WHAT AGAIN
AND THAT MYSTERIOUS STAIRCASE THE PASSAGE THROUGH WHICH NOT TO DISTURB THEIR SLEEP THE DOCTOR AND NURSE PASS OR EVEN THE FATHER CARRYING THE SLEEPING CHILD
OR RATHER MY ACQUAINTANCE DURING THE LAST THIRTY YEARS YOU KNOW I HAVE MADE THE MOST OF MY ARMS THOUGH I NEVER FORGOT MY ORIGIN A PROOF OF GREAT HUMILITY OR GREAT PRIDE SAID MONTE CRISTO
IT WAS EASY TO ASCERTAIN THIS BUT HOW COULD HE RISK THE QUESTION IT WAS EASY TO CALL HIS JAILER'S ATTENTION TO THE NOISE AND WATCH HIS COUNTENANCE AS HE LISTENED
HIS EYES SPARKLING WITH AVARICE OH YOU KNEW THAT WELL ENOUGH BEFORE SPEAKING TO ME SAID ANDREA BECOMING MORE AND MORE EXCITED IF I HAD BEEN WEARING A HANDKERCHIEF LIKE YOURS ON MY HEAD
BY THE SAD CONVICTION THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO DO SO FOR WERE IT ONCE DISCOVERED BY HER FATHER AND MOTHER ALL WOULD BE LOST TWO HOURS PASSED THUS
I EAT EVERYWHERE AND OF EVERYTHING ONLY I EAT BUT LITTLE AND TO DAY THAT YOU REPROACH ME WITH MY WANT OF APPETITE IS MY DAY OF APPETITE
IF YOU WISH TO GO ALONE SIR I WILL GO AND TELL MY MISTRESS
THE BRIGANDS HAVE NEVER BEEN REALLY EXTIRPATED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROME SOMETIMES A CHIEF IS WANTED BUT WHEN A CHIEF PRESENTS HIMSELF HE RARELY HAS TO WAIT LONG FOR A BAND OF FOLLOWERS THE CELEBRATED CUCUMETTO
AND THAT IS WHAT I TOLD THE GENTLEMAN AS WE WALKED ALONG PERMIT ME SAID THE NOTARY TURNING FIRST TO VILLEFORT AND THEN TO VALENTINE PERMIT ME TO STATE THAT THE CASE IN QUESTION IS JUST ONE OF THOSE IN WHICH A PUBLIC OFFICER LIKE MYSELF
DOCTOR EVERY SON OF WOMAN IS BORN TO SUFFER AND TO DIE I AM CONTENT TO SUFFER AND TO AWAIT DEATH
AND IT WAS EVIDENT DANGLARS WOULD NOT FIGHT AND IN ADDITION TO THIS EVERYTHING FORGOTTEN OR UNPERCEIVED BEFORE PRESENTED ITSELF NOW TO HIS RECOLLECTION MONTE CRISTO KNEW EVERYTHING AS HE HAD BOUGHT THE DAUGHTER OF ALI PASHA
MORE A SLIGHT COLOR SEEMED STRIVING TO RISE IN HIS PALE CHEEKS HIS NOSTRILS DILATED LIKE THOSE OF A WILD BEAST THAT SCENTS ITS PREY AND HIS LIPS HALF OPENED DISCLOSED HIS WHITE TEETH SMALL AND SHARP LIKE THOSE OF A JACKAL
ARE YOU GOING TO MARRY MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS WHY DO YOU ASK ME NOW BECAUSE THE RUPTURE OR FULFILMENT OF THIS ENGAGEMENT IS CONNECTED WITH THE PERSON OF WHOM WE WERE SPEAKING
IN SOME PARTS OF FRANCE YES EXCELLENCY YOU KNOW THE ENVIRONS OF PARIS THEN NO EXCELLENCY NO RETURNED THE STEWARD WITH A SORT OF NERVOUS TREMBLING WHICH MONTE CRISTO A CONNOISSEUR IN ALL EMOTIONS RIGHTLY ATTRIBUTED TO GREAT DISQUIETUDE
THE STEPS EVEN SEEMED A PARTI COLORED SEA THAT WAS IMPELLED TOWARDS THE PORTICO EVERY NICHE IN THE WALL HELD ITS LIVING STATUE WHAT THE COUNT SAID WAS TRUE THE MOST CURIOUS SPECTACLE IN LIFE IS THAT OF DEATH AND YET
AND THE LADIES SNATCHING THEIR BOUQUETS FROM THEIR FAIR BOSOMS STREWED THE TABLE WITH THEIR FLORAL TREASURES IN A WORD AN ALMOST POETICAL FERVOR PREVAILED AH SAID THE MARQUISE DE SAINT MERAN
WELL SAID ANDREA
AND EVEN THEN MY VESSELS WOULD BECOME CARAVANS SO MUCH THE BETTER
I SOMETIMES LOSE ALL RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST AND THEN I EXPERIENCE THE SAME SORT OF HAPPINESS I CAN IMAGINE THE DEAD FEEL STILL IT IS BETTER THAN SUFFERING BUT SIR HE HAS FLED LET HIM ESCAPE INACTION IS A PARDONABLE OFFENCE
AND YOU KNOW I AM A SPECULATOR
FRANZ WAS FASCINATED BY THE HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THE TWO ASSISTANTS HAD BORNE ANDREA TO THE SCAFFOLD AND THERE IN SPITE OF HIS STRUGGLES HIS BITES AND HIS CRIES HAD FORCED HIM TO HIS KNEES DURING THIS TIME THE EXECUTIONER HAD RAISED HIS MACE
SEND ME THE BOWSTRING AND MAKE MY SECRETARIES STRANGLE ME YOU SAY VERY TRUE RESPONDED DEBRAY YES SAID ALBERT
I HAVE BEEN ALMOST OBLIGED TO WAIT BERTUCCIO MADE BUT ONE BOUND TO THE ANTE CHAMBER AND CRIED IN A HOARSE VOICE HIS EXCELLENCY'S HORSES MONTE CRISTO WROTE TWO OR THREE NOTES AND AS HE SEALED THE LAST THE STEWARD APPEARED
NOW WHAT IS VAGUE IS DOUBTFUL AND IT WAS A WISE MAN WHO SAID
BUT IN SUCH A SITUATION A SINGLE MOMENT SUFFICES TO CHANGE THE STRONGEST DOUBT INTO CERTAINTY YES YES HE MURMURED I AM IN THE HANDS OF THE BRIGANDS OF WHOM ALBERT DE MORCERF SPOKE
EITHER IN VOICE OR FACE IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE POINTS OF ENGLISH HORSES THE COUNTENANCE OF POOR ALI RECOVERED ITS SERENITY PERMIT ME TO ASSURE YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID BERTUCCIO
FOR A MOMENT THE IDEA OF STRUGGLING CROSSED HIS MIND AND OF SO ENDING THE UNEXPECTED EVIL THAT HAD OVERTAKEN HIM
THANKS SAID THE LATTER CLOSING THE REGISTER WITH A SLAM I HAVE ALL I WANT NOW IT IS FOR ME TO PERFORM MY PROMISE GIVE ME A SIMPLE ASSIGNMENT OF YOUR DEBT ACKNOWLEDGE THEREIN THE RECEIPT OF THE CASH AND I WILL HAND YOU OVER THE MONEY
AND THE NOTARY HAD ARRIVED THOUGH HIS COMING WAS ANNOUNCED IN A VERY LOW TONE MADAME DE SAINT MERAN AROSE FROM HER PILLOW THE NOTARY SHE EXCLAIMED LET HIM COME IN
YOU THEREFORE STILL OWE ME FIVE MILLIONS AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS I WILL TAKE THE FIVE SCRAPS OF PAPER THAT I NOW HOLD AS BONDS WITH YOUR SIGNATURE ALONE AND HERE IS A RECEIPT IN FULL FOR THE SIX MILLIONS BETWEEN US
AND IT COST ME THREE THOUSAND FRANCS LET US HEAR THE HISTORY SAID FRANZ MOTIONING SIGNOR PASTRINI TO SEAT HIMSELF
AND IN FRANCE ETERNAL FRIENDSHIPS ARE AS RARE AS THE CUSTOM OF DIVIDING BREAD AND SALT WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT SAID THE COUNTESS BREATHLESSLY WITH HER EYES FIXED ON MONTE CRISTO WHOSE ARM SHE CONVULSIVELY PRESSED WITH BOTH HANDS WE ARE FRIENDS ARE WE NOT
MY DEAR FRIEND SAID ALBERT TO BEAUCHAMP IT IS PLAIN THAT THE AFFAIRS OF SPAIN ARE SETTLED
A BANKER NEVER LOSES AN OPPORTUNITY OF DOUBLING HIS CAPITAL IS YOUR EXCELLENCY REALLY IN EARNEST INQUIRED THE STEWARD MONTE CRISTO REGARDED THE PERSON WHO DURST PRESUME TO DOUBT HIS WORDS WITH THE LOOK OF ONE EQUALLY SURPRISED AND DISPLEASED
AS SOON AS I LEARNED I COULD IN ANY WAY ASSIST YOU I MOST EAGERLY SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF OFFERING MY SERVICES THE TWO YOUNG MEN BOWED FRANZ HAD AS YET FOUND NOTHING TO SAY
I THINK IT IS QUITE TIME TO THINK OF GIVING ME SOMETHING TO EAT BUT WHETHER HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM OR WHETHER HE HAD RECEIVED NO ORDERS RESPECTING THE NOURISHMENT OF DANGLARS THE GIANT WITHOUT ANSWERING WENT ON WITH HIS DINNER
THE WALLS ARE DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE REST THE GRATINGS ARE EVERY DAY CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY JAILERS WHOSE HERCULEAN PROPORTIONS AND COLD PITILESS EXPRESSION
MADAME DE VILLEFORT WHO WAS IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS WOULD NEITHER BELIEVE NOR THINK OF THE MISFORTUNE BUT MADEMOISELLE VALENTINE AT THE FIRST WORDS GUESSED THE WHOLE TRUTH NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE PRECAUTIONS OF HER FATHER THE BLOW STRUCK HER LIKE A THUNDERBOLT AND SHE FELL SENSELESS
THAT IS BEING WRESTED FROM ITS GRASP SUDDENLY HE RALLIED MADE A VIOLENT EFFORT TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF AND THEN A SMILE GRADUALLY WIDENED THE FEATURES OF HIS DISTURBED COUNTENANCE CERTAINLY HE SAID YOUR RECEIPT IS MONEY
IT APPEARS TO ME THAT YOU RECEIVE A FRIEND WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CEREMONY GROUND ARMS EXCLAIMED THE CHIEF WITH AN IMPERATIVE SIGN OF THE HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY THEN TURNING TO THE SINGULAR PERSONAGE WHO HAD CAUSED THIS SCENE HE SAID
THAT I WAS THERE AND MY PRESENCE HAD THE EFFECT OF RENDERING YOU UNJUST IN YOUR COMPARISON NO BUT TELL ME IT IS A QUESTION OF SIMPLE CURIOSITY AND WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY CERTAIN IDEAS PASSING IN MY MIND RELATIVE
AND AS HE SMOKES HIS CHIBOUQUE SEE ALL PARIS PASS BEFORE HIM YOU HAVE NO IDEA THEN MORREL ASKED CHATEAU RENAUD YOU DO NOT PROPOSE ANYTHING OH YES RETURNED THE YOUNG MAN SMILING ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE ONE
THE ANSWER WAS SO LITTLE LIKE THE ONE MERCEDES DESIRED THAT SHE TURNED AWAY TO GIVE VENT TO A SIGH WHICH SOUNDED MORE LIKE A GROAN THANK YOU SHE SAID AND THEY WALKED ON AGAIN THEY WENT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE GARDEN WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD
INSTEAD OF AS IS THE CASE WHEN A CURTAIN FALLS ON A TRAGEDY GOING HOME TO SUP PEACEFULLY WITH HIS FAMILY AND THEN RETIRING TO REST THAT HE MAY RECOMMENCE HIS MIMIC WOES ON THE MORROW IS REMOVED FROM YOUR SIGHT MERELY TO BE RECONDUCTED TO HIS PRISON
I THOUGHT YOU WERE EARNING A LIVING IN TUSCANY OR PIEDMONT BY ACTING AS FACCHINO OR CICERONE AND I PITIED YOU SINCERELY AS I WOULD A CHILD OF MY OWN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS DID CALL YOU MY CHILD
THE UNFORTUNATE YOUTH WAS INTREPID IN THE ATTACK AND RUDE IN THE DEFENCE
IT WAS NOT I WHO MADE THAT PROMISE CRIED MORCERF IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ONE ELSE WHOM YOU HAVE RESCUED IN THE SAME MANNER AND WHOM YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN PRAY SPEAK OF IT FOR I SHALL NOT ONLY I TRUST RELATE THE LITTLE I DO KNOW BUT ALSO A GREAT DEAL I DO NOT KNOW
WHY SO BECAUSE THOUGH I AM NOT A BARON BY BIRTH
COME YOU DO NOT FLATTER HIM I SCARCELY KNOW HIM I THINK I HAVE SEEN HIM THREE TIMES IN MY LIFE ALL I KNOW RELATING TO HIM IS THROUGH BUSONI AND HIMSELF
THOUGH SHE HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO PUT ON THE OUTWARD SEMBLANCE OF WOE SHE THEN TURNED TOWARDS THE AVENUE AS SHE ADVANCED SHE FANCIED SHE HEARD A VOICE SPEAKING HER NAME SHE STOPPED ASTONISHED
A FEW WORDS SUFFICED FOR A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE TWO OFFICERS OF THE LAW THEY READ TO NOIRTIER THE FORMAL COPY OF A WILL
YOU SENT FOR ME HE SAID TO THE PRISONER ARE YOU SIR THE CHIEF OF THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT ME HERE YES YOUR EXCELLENCY WHAT THEN HOW MUCH DO YOU REQUIRE FOR MY RANSOM MERELY THE FIVE MILLION YOU HAVE ABOUT YOU
WHO IS ALWAYS TEASING ME ABOUT COMING TO WORK AT MY EMBROIDERY WHICH I AM IN A FAIR WAY NEVER TO GET DONE SO PRAY EXCUSE YOURSELF AS WELL AS YOU CAN FOR HAVING MADE ME WAIT AND AFTER THAT TELL ME WHY I SEE YOU IN A DRESS SO SINGULAR THAT AT FIRST I DID NOT RECOGNIZE YOU
NO NOISE DISTURBED THE SILENCE BUT THE OWL WHOSE PIERCING CRY SEEMED TO BE CALLING UP THE PHANTOMS OF THE NIGHT I TIED MY LANTERN TO A FORKED BRANCH I HAD NOTICED A YEAR BEFORE
AND SWALLOWS NESTS IN CHINA I EAT EVERYWHERE AND OF EVERYTHING ONLY I EAT BUT LITTLE AND TO DAY
PROBABLY BECAUSE THE CAPTIVES POSSESS TEETH WHICH FREQUENTLY GNAW THE BARS AND SOMETIMES THE KEEPERS ALSO IT IS A PRISON WITHIN A PRISON THE WALLS ARE DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE REST THE GRATINGS ARE EVERY DAY CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY JAILERS WHOSE HERCULEAN PROPORTIONS AND
AND I ASSURE YOU HE SEEMED FULLY TO COMPREHEND THAT THIS MODE OF RECONCILING POLITICAL DIFFERENCES WAS BASED UPON SOUND AND EXCELLENT PRINCIPLES THEN THE KING WHO WITHOUT OUR SUSPECTING IT HAD OVERHEARD OUR CONVERSATION
AND ORDERED HIM TO SELL AT ANY PRICE WHEN IT WAS SEEN THAT DANGLARS SOLD THE SPANISH FUNDS FELL DIRECTLY DANGLARS LOST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS BUT HE RID HIMSELF OF ALL HIS SPANISH SHARES
HE OFFERED HIM ONE THOUSAND FRANCS FOR A MOUTHFUL OF BREAD BUT PEPPINO DID NOT ANSWER ON THE FIFTH DAY HE DRAGGED HIMSELF TO THE DOOR OF THE CELL ARE YOU NOT A CHRISTIAN HE SAID FALLING ON HIS KNEES
BUT ON THE CONTRARY THE PARTICULARS WHICH ARE GIVEN PROVE THAT FERNAND MONDEGO RAISED BY ALI PASHA TO THE RANK OF GOVERNOR GENERAL IS NO OTHER THAN COUNT FERNAND OF MORCERF
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU SHOULD BE SEEN THERE DO YOU THINK SO ASKED THE BARONESS I DO IN THAT CASE I WILL GO AND THE TWO CARRIAGES PASSED ON TOWARDS THEIR DIFFERENT DESTINATIONS MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE CAME
AND TWO MORE WITH MY PISTOLS BUT I WAS THEN DISARMED AND TWO WERE STILL LEFT ONE SEIZED ME BY THE HAIR THAT IS WHY I NOW WEAR IT SO SHORT FOR NO ONE KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN THE OTHER SWUNG A YATAGHAN AND I ALREADY FELT THE COLD STEEL ON MY NECK
BERTUCCIO CRIED HE STRIKING A LIGHT HAMMER WITH A PLIANT HANDLE ON A SMALL GONG BERTUCCIO THE STEWARD APPEARED AT THE DOOR MONSIEUR BERTUCCIO SAID THE COUNT DID YOU NEVER TELL ME THAT YOU HAD TRAVELLED IN FRANCE
AS SHE HAD A COMMUNICATION TO MAKE ON WHICH A PART OF MY FORTUNE DEPENDED LET THEM TAKE MY FORTUNE I AM ALREADY TOO RICH AND PERHAPS WHEN THEY HAVE TAKEN IT THEY WILL LEAVE ME IN PEACE AND QUIETNESS
LET US TALK OF THOSE IF YOU PLEASE WHO SENT YOU COME COME YOU ARE GOING ON QUICKLY M
REPLIED THE DUKE HERE I THINK IS ONE OF MY SERVANTS WHO IS SEEKING YOU THE DUKE WAS NOT MISTAKEN WHEN HE SAW FRANZ THE SERVANT CAME UP TO HIM YOUR EXCELLENCY HE SAID THE MASTER OF THE HOTEL DE LONDRES
WHICH IS ONE OF THE SAFEST BANKS IN PARIS AND DOES MY FATHER MEAN TO REMAIN LONG IN PARIS ASKED ANDREA ONLY A FEW DAYS REPLIED MONTE CRISTO HIS SERVICE DOES NOT ALLOW HIM TO ABSENT HIMSELF MORE THAN TWO OR THREE WEEKS TOGETHER AH MY DEAR FATHER
HE IS A WISE MAN ACCORDING TO HIS OWN SHOWING
AND PRAY THAT IF YOU SHOULD EVER BE IN A SIMILAR PREDICAMENT HE MAY DO AS MUCH FOR YOU AS HE DID FOR ME
AND THEY BOTH RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY TO THE PROCUREUR'S STUDY
CONSIDER BY BECOMING A GARDENER I EFFECTUALLY SCREEN OUR MEETINGS FROM ALL SUSPICION OR DANGER I BESEECH OF YOU MAXIMILIAN TO CEASE TRIFLING AND TELL ME WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN SIMPLY
ONCE AGAIN KISSED THE ICE COLD BROW AND TRIED VAINLY TO CLOSE THE RESISTING EYES WHICH GLARED HORRIBLY TURNED THE HEAD TOWARDS THE WALL SO THAT THE JAILER MIGHT WHEN HE BROUGHT THE EVENING MEAL BELIEVE THAT HE WAS ASLEEP AS WAS HIS FREQUENT CUSTOM
AND GREEK MISTRESSES HAVE YOU SEEN THE GREEK MISTRESS
THE CHILD UNACCUSTOMED TO SUCH TREATMENT AROSE PALE AND TREMBLING
WELL I WENT TO A HORSE DEALER'S WHERE I SAW THIS MAGNIFICENT HORSE WHICH I HAVE NAMED MEDEAH I ASKED THE PRICE
MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI AND YOU REALLY MEAN TO SAY MONSIEUR THAT MY DEAR FATHER IS HERE YES SIR AND I CAN EVEN ADD THAT I HAVE ONLY JUST LEFT HIS COMPANY THE HISTORY WHICH HE RELATED TO ME OF HIS LOST SON TOUCHED ME TO THE QUICK
I WOULD WISH TO KNOW IF THEY HAVE NOT IN SOME MEASURE CONTRIBUTED TO RENDER YOU A STRANGER TO THE WORLD IN WHICH YOUR FORTUNE AND YOUR NAME ENTITLE YOU TO MAKE A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE SIR RETURNED THE YOUNG MAN WITH A REASSURANCE OF MANNER
AN ENGLISHMAN SAID MONTE CRISTO WHO GREW UNEASY AT THE ATTENTION WITH WHICH JULIE LOOKED AT HIM AN ENGLISHMAN YOU SAY YES REPLIED MAXIMILIAN AN ENGLISHMAN WHO REPRESENTED HIMSELF AS THE CONFIDENTIAL CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH AT ROME
I CANNOT SEE IT IN THE SAME LIGHT AS YOU DO WHAT APPEARS TO YOU TO EMANATE FROM A CELESTIAL SOURCE SEEMS TO ME TO PROCEED FROM ONE FAR LESS PURE PROVIDENCE APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE NO SHARE IN THIS AFFAIR AND HAPPILY SO
AND LAFAYETTE THAT WAS A NOBLE EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW MONSIEUR
BUT TWO MILLION FRANCS MAKE A NICE LITTLE SUM REPLIED MORCERF
HAD DOUBTLESS RECOMMENDED THE SUFFERER AH ADDED THE COUNT IN A CONTEMPTUOUS TONE
MAY I BE HANGED IF I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE CAN EAT SUCH FILTH AND HE WITHDREW TO SEAT HIMSELF UPON HIS GOAT SKIN WHICH REMINDED HIM OF THE SMELL OF THE BRANDY
HE STARTED WHEN HE SAW RENEE FOR HE FANCIED SHE WAS AGAIN ABOUT TO PLEAD FOR DANTES
WHO SUPPLIED YOU WITH THE MATERIALS FOR MAKING THIS WONDERFUL WORK I TORE UP SEVERAL OF MY SHIRTS AND RIPPED OUT THE SEAMS IN THE SHEETS OF MY BED DURING MY THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT AT FENESTRELLE
AND FASTENED THE STRING TO THE NAIL AND CAST A LOOK AROUND THE MAN AT THE TELEGRAPH SAID HE MUST EITHER ENGAGE A GARDENER OR DEVOTE HIMSELF PASSIONATELY TO AGRICULTURE
WHICH WILL MAKE IT STILL MORE DIFFICULT MY FRIEND SAID MORCERF LET US ENJOY THE PRESENT WITHOUT GLOOMY FOREBODINGS FOR THE FUTURE AT LEAST WE CAN HAVE A WINDOW WHERE IN THE CORSO AH A WINDOW EXCLAIMED SIGNOR PASTRINI
BUT NO ON REFLECTION THE PROCUREUR WAS NOT A MERCILESS MAN AND IT WAS NOT THE MAGISTRATE SLAVE TO HIS DUTIES BUT THE FRIEND THE LOYAL FRIEND WHO ROUGHLY BUT FIRMLY CUT INTO THE VERY CORE OF THE CORRUPTION
AND BELIEVED FIRMLY IN HER DAUGHTER'S INNOCENCE AND FIDELITY TO THE PATERNAL ROOF SHE LISTENED AT EUGENIE'S DOOR AND HEARING NO SOUND TRIED TO ENTER BUT THE BOLTS WERE IN PLACE MADAME DANGLARS THEN CONCLUDED THAT THE YOUNG GIRL HAD BEEN OVERCOME WITH THE TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT OF THE EVENING
EDMOND AH YOU ARE THERE
MANY OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE THE IMPORT OF WHICH WAS A UNANIMOUS OPINION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING SINISTER ABOUT THE ROOM IS IT NOT SO ASKED MONTE CRISTO LOOK AT THAT LARGE CLUMSY BED HUNG WITH SUCH GLOOMY BLOOD COLORED DRAPERY
YOU LIVE BADLY ON YOUR THOUSAND FRANCS BADLY ENOUGH BUT YET I DO LIVE YES BUT YOU HAVE A WRETCHEDLY SMALL GARDEN TRUE THE GARDEN IS NOT LARGE
WITH THE AIR OF A MOUNTEBANK SOUNDING HIS OWN PRAISES TO INVOLVE ME THREE GOVERNMENTS MUST CRUMBLE TO DUST WELL SUCH THINGS HAVE BEEN THAT THERE SHOULD BE A FAMINE RECOLLECT THE SEVEN FAT AND THE SEVEN LEAN KINE
STAY SAID DEBRAY I RECOGNIZE THIS HOBBEMA AH INDEED YES IT WAS PROPOSED FOR THE MUSEUM WHICH I BELIEVE DOES NOT CONTAIN ONE SAID MONTE CRISTO
I SHALL BE GONE ONLY A FEW MOMENTS
AND OPENED IT WITH A KEY WHICH HE WORE ROUND HIS NECK AND WHICH NEVER LEFT HIM AFTER HAVING SOUGHT FOR A FEW MINUTES HE STOPPED AT A LEAF WHICH HAD SEVERAL NOTES AND COMPARED THEM WITH THE DEED OF SALE WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE
DO NOT YIELD TO THOSE GLOOMY THOUGHTS YOU WILL LONG LIVE WITH US HAPPY LOVED AND HONORED AND WE WILL MAKE YOU FORGET NEVER NEVER NEVER SAID THE MARCHIONESS
WHICH MEANS WHICH MEANS THAT MY COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO IS ONE OF THOSE FISHERMEN HE HAS EVEN A NAME TAKEN FROM THE BOOK SINCE HE CALLS HIMSELF SINBAD THE SAILOR AND HAS A CAVE FILLED WITH GOLD AND YOU HAVE SEEN THIS CAVERN MORCERF
THE COUNT STRUCK THRICE UPON HIS GONG WHEN ALI WAS WANTED ONE STROKE WAS GIVEN TWO SUMMONED BAPTISTIN AND THREE BERTUCCIO THE STEWARD ENTERED
WHICH REMINDED MONTE CRISTO OF THE SICKLY MOONS WHICH BAD ARTISTS ARE SO FOND OF DAUBING INTO THEIR PICTURES OF RUINS BUT WHILE WE ARE SPEAKING OF BUSINESS DANGLARS ADDED
AND GRADUALLY THE MAN APPEARED LESS UGLY THE BREAD LESS BLACK AND THE CHEESE MORE FRESH WHILE THOSE DREADFUL VULGAR ONIONS RECALLED TO HIS MIND CERTAIN SAUCES AND SIDE DISHES WHICH HIS COOK PREPARED IN A VERY SUPERIOR MANNER WHENEVER HE SAID
SHE SAID TO HER CHUM SADIE THE GIRL THAT WAITS ON YOU WITH HER LEFT SIDE SAY SADE I MADE A DATE FOR DINNER THIS EVENING WITH PIGGY
THE LOCAL NOTE OF THE MERE GLOBE TROTTER BUT HIS OPINIONS NEVER FLUTTERED OR DROOPED HE WAS AS IMPARTIAL TO CITIES COUNTRIES AND CONTINENTS AS THE WINDS OR GRAVITATION AND AS E RUSHMORE COGLAN PRATTLED OF THIS LITTLE PLANET I THOUGHT WITH GLEE
AND YET SOMEHOW I COULD NEVER THINK OF HER AS EXISTING OUTSIDE OF CYPHER'S THERE NATURE HAD PLACED HER AND SHE HAD TAKEN ROOT AND GROWN MIGHTILY
HER VOICE RANG LIKE A GREAT SILVER BELL HER SMILE WAS MANY TOOTHED AND FREQUENT SHE SEEMED LIKE A YELLOW SUNRISE ON MOUNTAIN TOPS I NEVER SAW HER BUT I THOUGHT OF THE YOSEMITE
PRINCE MICHAEL SAT ON HIS FAVOURITE BENCH AND SMILED IT WAS A DIVERTING THOUGHT TO HIM THAT HE WAS WEALTHY ENOUGH TO BUY EVERY ONE OF THOSE CLOSE RANGED BULKY WINDOW LIT MANSIONS THAT FACED HIM IF HE CHOSE
ONCE SHE MOVED OVER BY MAXWELL'S DESK NEAR ENOUGH FOR HIM TO BE AWARE OF HER PRESENCE THE MACHINE SITTING AT THAT DESK WAS NO LONGER A MAN IT WAS A BUSY NEW YORK BROKER MOVED BY BUZZING WHEELS
PEDESTALLED AND IN BRONZE SHE MIGHT HAVE STOOD WITH THE NOBLEST OF HER HEROIC SISTERS AS LIVER AND BACON ENLIVENING THE WORLD SHE BELONGED TO CYPHER'S YOU EXPECTED TO SEE HER COLOSSAL FIGURE LOOM THROUGH THAT REEKING BLUE CLOUD OF SMOKE FROM FRYING FAT
IN HER NEAT BLACK TURBAN HAT WAS THE GOLD GREEN WING OF A MACAW ON THIS MORNING SHE WAS SOFTLY AND SHYLY RADIANT HER EYES WERE DREAMILY BRIGHT HER CHEEKS GENUINE PEACHBLOW HER EXPRESSION A HAPPY ONE
EVEN PITCHER'S FACE RELAXED INTO SOMETHING RESEMBLING ANIMATION ON THE EXCHANGE THERE WERE HURRICANES AND LANDSLIDES AND SNOWSTORMS AND GLACIERS AND VOLCANOES AND THOSE ELEMENTAL DISTURBANCES
IT DOESN'T LOOK AS IF I WOULD NEED THAT PALACE ON THE HUDSON BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER JUST THE SAME PRINCE MICHAEL SANK INTO DEEP SLUMBER HIS BATTERED HAT ROLLED FROM THE BENCH TO THE GROUND
BUT OH MISTER TOOMEY YOU ARE SO DASHING SO RECKLESS SUPPOSE IN YOUR ENTHUSIASM SOME ACCIDENT SHOULD BEFALL YOU THEN WHAT OLD MAN DENNY READ ON ABOUT THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITH ONE FINGER ON THE LINES
ITS FACE IS THAT OF A TYRANT ITS NUMBERS ARE FALSE AS THOSE ON A LOTTERY TICKET ITS HANDS ARE THOSE OF A BUNCO STEERER WHO MAKES AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOU TO YOUR RUIN
THEN SHE BECAME INTENSELY INTERESTED IN A LITTLE RED SPECK ON THE SIDE OF HER NOSE AND AFTER THAT WAS ATTENDED TO SHE DREW UP A CHAIR TO THE RICKETY TABLE AND TOLD HER FORTUNE WITH AN OLD DECK OF CARDS
OHO WON'T IT THUNDERED THE CHAMPION OF THE ROOT OF EVIL YOU TELL ME WHERE YOUR EXCLUSIVE CIRCLES WOULD BE IF THE FIRST ASTOR HADN'T HAD THE MONEY TO PAY FOR HIS STEERAGE PASSAGE OVER RICHARD SIGHED
WE WERE AT OUR SUPPER OF BEEF STEW AND DRIED APPLES WHEN HE TROTTED IN AS IF ON THE HEELS OF A DOG TEAM AND MADE ONE OF THE MESS AT OUR TABLE WITH THE FREEDOM OF THE CAMPS HE ASSAULTED OUR EARS AND CLAIMED THE FELLOWSHIP OF MEN LOST IN THE WILDS OF A HASH HOUSE
IN THE SHADOWED SPOTS FAUNS AND HAMADRYADS WOOED UNCONSCIOUS OF THE GAZE OF MORTAL EYES A HAND ORGAN PHILOMEL BY THE GRACE OF OUR STAGE CARPENTER FANCY FLUTED AND DRONED IN A SIDE STREET AROUND THE ENCHANTED BOUNDARIES OF THE LITTLE PARK
SHE WORE NO CHAINS BRACELETS OR LOCKETS SHE HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING ABOUT TO ACCEPT AN INVITATION TO LUNCHEON HER DRESS WAS GREY AND PLAIN BUT IT FITTED HER FIGURE WITH FIDELITY AND DISCRETION
PARK BUM FOR TWENTY YEARS ON HIS LAST LEGS I GUESS THE OTHER POLICEMAN STOOPED AND LOOKED AT SOMETHING CRUMPLED AND CRISP IN THE HAND OF THE SLEEPER
I WAS ABOUT TO PUT MY OPINION TO THE TEST BY INQUIRING OF THIS GENTLEMAN WHEN YOU INTERRUPTED WITH YOUR OWN LARGER THEORY I MUST CONFESS AND NOW THE DARK HAIRED YOUNG MAN SPOKE TO ME
ENDING NEAR THE FLOOR WITH A SILVER HEART THERE WAS A SELF POSSESSED YOUNG LADY CONNECTED WITH THESE ACCESSORIES AND PITCHER WAS THERE TO CONSTRUE HER LADY FROM THE STENOGRAPHER'S AGENCY TO SEE ABOUT THE POSITION SAID PITCHER MAXWELL TURNED HALF AROUND
SAID ANTHONY DECIDEDLY I'VE HEARD OF THESE YOUNG BLOODS SPENDING TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS A DOZEN FOR SOAP AND GOING OVER THE HUNDRED MARK FOR CLOTHES YOU'VE GOT AS MUCH MONEY TO WASTE AS ANY OF EM AND YET YOU STICK TO WHAT'S DECENT AND MODERATE NOW I USE THE OLD EUREKA NOT ONLY FOR SENTIMENT BUT IT'S THE PUREST SOAP MADE
WITH HIS SWORD CLANKING AGAINST HIS HIGH BOOTS ONCE WHEN A BOY WAS RATTLING A PIECE OF CHAIN AGAINST A LAMP POST
OUR GODDESS OF GRUB WAS BUILT ON LINES SO MAJESTIC THAT THEY COULD BE FOLLOWED ONLY WITH AWE HER SLEEVES WERE ALWAYS ROLLED ABOVE HER ELBOWS
AND THEY DID NOT APPEAR TO BE GETTING ANY OF US OUT A FLY COP AN ANGEL POLICEMAN FLEW OVER TO ME AND TOOK ME BY THE LEFT WING NEAR AT HAND WAS A GROUP OF VERY PROSPEROUS LOOKING SPIRITS ARRAIGNED FOR JUDGMENT
OH WAILED MISSUS MURPHY TWAS YISTERDAY OR MAYBE FOUR HOURS AGO I DUNNO BUT IT'S LOST HE IS ME LITTLE BOY MIKE HE WAS PLAYIN ON THE SIDEWALK ONLY THIS MORNIN' OR WAS IT WEDNESDAY I'M THAT BUSY WITH WORK TIS HARD TO KEEP UP WITH DATES

TO THE BEAK OF A ROBBER JAY I WAS TOLD BY A SCULPTOR FROM MAUCH CHUNK THAT THE SCENE WAS TRULY PARISIAN MY COSMOPOLITE WAS NAMED E RUSHMORE COGLAN
THIS I SAY HAPPENED THREE YEARS AGO AND ABOUT THAT TIME A LITTLE LUCK DESCENDED UPON US THREE AND WE WERE ENABLED TO BUY COSTLIER AND LESS WHOLESOME FOOD THAN CYPHER'S
SHE WAS A GRAND EXAMPLE OF KRAFT'S THEORY OF THE ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE SHE BELONGED LARGELY TO WAITING AS MINERVA DID TO THE ART OF SCRAPPING OR VENUS TO THE SCIENCE OF SERIOUS FLIRTATION
AND THE KLONDIKER THREW DOWN HIS PELTS AND NUGGETS AS DROSS AND LET HIS JAW FALL HALF WAY AND STARED AT HER YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THE DIAMOND TIARAS ON MILLY'S BROW AND THE HAND EMBROIDERED SILK PARIS GOWNS THAT HE MEANT TO BUY FOR HER
I WON'T DETAIN YOU A MINUTE I SAW WHERE IT FELL IN LESS THAN A MINUTE HE WAS BACK IN THE CAB WITH THE RING BUT WITHIN THAT MINUTE A CROSSTOWN CAR HAD STOPPED DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE CAB THE CABMAN TRIED TO PASS TO THE LEFT BUT A HEAVY EXPRESS WAGON CUT HIM OFF HE TRIED THE RIGHT
AT MIDNIGHT THE CAFE WAS CROWDED BY SOME CHANCE THE LITTLE TABLE AT WHICH I SAT HAD ESCAPED THE EYE OF INCOMERS AND TWO VACANT CHAIRS AT IT EXTENDED THEIR ARMS WITH VENAL HOSPITALITY TO THE INFLUX OF PATRONS
THERE AS IT SHOULD BE THE DRUGGIST IS A COUNSELLOR A CONFESSOR AN ADVISER AN ABLE AND WILLING MISSIONARY AND MENTOR WHOSE LEARNING IS RESPECTED WHOSE OCCULT WISDOM IS VENERATED AND WHOSE MEDICINE IS OFTEN POURED
WE HAD NO CREDIT WE WENT IN CALLED FOR FOOD AND ATE IT WE PAID OR WE DID NOT PAY WE HAD CONFIDENCE IN CYPHER'S SULLENNESS AND SMOULDERING FEROCITY
THE OLDEST NEW YORKER AMONG THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS THAT LINED THE SIDEWALKS HAD NOT WITNESSED A STREET BLOCKADE OF THE PROPORTIONS OF THIS ONE I'M VERY SORRY SAID RICHARD AS HE RESUMED HIS SEAT
HIS PABULUM WAS AN UNQUENCHABLE BELIEF IN THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE HIS THEORY WAS FIXED AROUND CORNED BEEF HASH WITH POACHED EGG THERE WAS A STORY BEHIND THE PICTURE SO I WENT HOME AND LET IT DRIP OUT OF A FOUNTAIN PEN THE IDEA OF KRAFT
TAKE HER FOR A WALK IN THE PARK OR A STRAW RIDE OR WALK HOME WITH HER FROM CHURCH CHANCE PSHAW YOU DON'T KNOW THE SOCIAL MILL DAD SHE'S PART OF THE STREAM THAT TURNS IT EVERY HOUR AND MINUTE OF HER TIME IS ARRANGED FOR DAYS IN ADVANCE
WITH ROSY HELD IN THE CLUTCHES OF MORPHEUS FOR A MANY HOURS DEEP SLUMBER AND THE BLOODTHIRSTY PARENT WAITING ARMED AND FOREWARNED IKEY FELT THAT HIS RIVAL WAS CLOSE INDEED UPON DISCOMFITURE
JOVIALLY SHARPLY VICIOUSLY EXCITEDLY MESSENGER BOYS RAN IN AND OUT WITH MESSAGES AND TELEGRAMS THE CLERKS IN THE OFFICE JUMPED ABOUT LIKE SAILORS DURING A STORM

THE LOVE PHILTRE OF IKEY SCHOENSTEIN THE BLUE LIGHT DRUG STORE IS DOWNTOWN BETWEEN THE BOWERY AND FIRST AVENUE WHERE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO STREETS IS THE SHORTEST THE BLUE LIGHT DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT PHARMACY IS A THING OF BRIC A BRAC SCENT AND ICE CREAM SODA
TO PAUSE IN A SORT OF INVOLUNTARY ARMISTICE
HER REST HAD NEVER BEEN DISTURBED BY WHISPERS OF STOLEN COPES NO CRITIC HAD ELEVATED HIS EYEBROWS AT HER INFANTILE ENTOMOLOGIST
HE WAS FOXIER STILL FINGER BOWLS WERE NOT BEYOND THE COMPASS OF HIS EXPERIENCE THEY WERE NOT TO BE HAD IN THE PENSION MURPHY BUT THEIR EQUIVALENT WAS AT HAND TRIUMPHANTLY HE SENT THE GRANITE WARE WASH BASIN AT THE HEAD OF HIS MATRIMONIAL ADVERSARY
DULCIE WAS PAID FIVE DOLLARS PER WEEK IT WOULD BE INSTRUCTIVE TO KNOW HOW SHE LIVED ON THAT AMOUNT DON'T CARE VERY WELL
WHY I'VE SEEN KENTUCKIANS WHO HATED WHISKEY VIRGINIANS WHO WEREN'T DESCENDED FROM POCAHONTAS INDIANIANS WHO HADN'T WRITTEN A NOVEL MEXICANS WHO DIDN'T WEAR VELVET TROUSERS WITH SILVER DOLLARS SEWED ALONG THE SEAMS

AND THERE WAS NO ROOM IN IT FOR THE HUMAN WORLD OR THE WORLD OF NATURE WHEN THE LUNCHEON HOUR DREW NEAR THERE CAME A SLIGHT LULL IN THE UPROAR MAXWELL STOOD BY HIS DESK WITH HIS HANDS FULL OF TELEGRAMS AND MEMORANDA
HE SAW A CONGESTED FLOOD OF WAGONS TRUCKS CABS VANS AND STREET CARS FILLING THE VAST SPACE WHERE BROADWAY SIXTH AVENUE AND THIRTY FOURTH STREET CROSS ONE ANOTHER AS A TWENTY SIX INCH MAIDEN FILLS HER TWENTY TWO INCH GIRDLE
OF THROWING A FILM OVER HIS EYES RENDERING OPAQUE THE WINDOWS OF HIS SOUL ONCE WHEN WE LEFT HIM UNPAID WITH EGREGIOUS EXCUSES I LOOKED BACK AND SAW HIM SHAKING WITH INAUDIBLE LAUGHTER BEHIND HIS FILM NOW AND THEN WE PAID UP BACK SCORES

AND IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT HIS MIND ALSO MOVED ALONG ITS OWN SET OF GROOVES I SHOULD LIKE TO BE A PERIWINKLE SAID HE MYSTERIOUSLY ON THE TOP OF A VALLEY AND SING TOORALLOO RALLOO

MY PEN IS NOT THE KIND INTENDED FOR HIM I AM NO CARPENTER AT TEN MINUTES TO SEVEN DULCIE WAS READY SHE LOOKED AT HERSELF IN THE WRINKLY MIRROR THE REFLECTION WAS SATISFACTORY THE DARK BLUE DRESS FITTING WITHOUT A WRINKLE
IMPERSONAL AND BRUSQUE FLASHED UPON HER HALF IMPATIENTLY NOTHING ANSWERED THE STENOGRAPHER MOVING AWAY WITH A LITTLE SMILE MISTER PITCHER SHE SAID TO THE CONFIDENTIAL CLERK
WHAT'S THE USE OF BRAGGING ABOUT BEING FROM THE NORTH OR THE SOUTH OR THE OLD MANOR HOUSE IN THE DALE OR EUCLID AVENUE CLEVELAND OR PIKE'S PEAK OR FAIRFAX COUNTY VIRGINIA OR HOOLIGAN'S FLATS OR ANY PLACE
I WOULDN'T HAVE THIS DOUBLE HANDICAP MAKE A FALSE START TO NIGHT FOR A MILLION HE SAID
AND THAT THE WORST WE WICKED ONES MAY EXPECT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION THIS IS A PLEASING HYPOTHESIS BUT THERE LINGERS YET SOME OF THE OLD GOODLY TERROR OF ORTHODOXY
THE WINDOWS OF MISSUS MURPHY'S BOARDING HOUSE WERE OPEN A GROUP OF BOARDERS WERE SEATED ON THE HIGH STOOP UPON ROUND FLAT MATS LIKE GERMAN PANCAKES IN ONE OF THE SECOND FLOOR FRONT WINDOWS MISSUS MC CASKEY AWAITED HER HUSBAND
I DREAMED THAT I WAS STANDING NEAR A CROWD OF PROSPEROUS LOOKING ANGELS
YOU SAID YOU WANTED DRUGS REMARKED IKEY MISTER MC GOWAN LOOKED ILL AT EASE AND HARASSED A CONDITION OPPOSED TO HIS USUAL LINE OF DEMEANOUR HE MADE A PATENT MEDICINE ALMANAC INTO A ROLL AND FITTED IT WITH UNPROFITABLE CAREFULNESS ABOUT HIS FINGER
CLAD AS THE POOREST OF MENDICANTS IN THE PARKS HE LOVED TO STUDY HUMANITY HE FOUND IN ALTRUISM MORE PLEASURE THAN HIS RICHES HIS STATION AND ALL THE GROSSER SWEETS OF LIFE HAD GIVEN HIM
FIFTEEN CENTS FOR SUPPER TEN CENTS FOR BREAKFAST TEN CENTS FOR LUNCH ANOTHER DIME WAS TO BE ADDED TO HER SMALL STORE OF SAVINGS AND FIVE CENTS WAS TO BE SQUANDERED FOR LICORICE DROPS

MISTER MC GOWAN SMILED NOT THEM HE SAID NOT ANY DAGOES BUT YOU'VE LOCATED THE DIAGNOSIS ALL RIGHT ENOUGH IT'S UNDER MY COAT NEAR THE RIBS SAY IKEY
THE OLD MAN LAID ASIDE HIS NEWSPAPER LOOKED AT HIM WITH A KINDLY GRIMNESS ON HIS BIG SMOOTH RUDDY COUNTENANCE RUMPLED HIS MOP OF WHITE HAIR WITH ONE HAND AND RATTLED THE KEYS IN HIS POCKET WITH THE OTHER RICHARD SAID ANTHONY ROCKWALL WHAT DO YOU PAY FOR THE SOAP THAT YOU USE
AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS IKEY'S FRIEND AND CUSTOMER AND OFTEN DROPPED IN AT THE BLUE LIGHT DRUG STORE TO HAVE A BRUISE PAINTED WITH IODINE OR GET A CUT RUBBER PLASTERED AFTER A PLEASANT EVENING SPENT ALONG THE BOWERY
THE YOUNG LADY HAD BEEN MAXWELL'S STENOGRAPHER FOR A YEAR SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL IN A WAY THAT WAS DECIDEDLY UNSTENOGRAPHIC SHE FOREWENT THE POMP OF THE ALLURING POMPADOUR
HE HAD NOT YET TAKEN THE MEASURE OF THIS SIRE OF HIS WHO WAS AS FULL OF UNEXPECTEDNESSES AS A GIRL AT HER FIRST PARTY SIX DOLLARS A DOZEN I THINK DAD AND YOUR CLOTHES I SUPPOSE ABOUT SIXTY DOLLARS AS A RULE YOU'RE A GENTLEMAN
THE MAY MOON SHONE BRIGHT UPON THE PRIVATE BOARDING HOUSE OF MISSUS MURPHY BY REFERENCE TO THE ALMANAC A LARGE AMOUNT OF TERRITORY WILL BE DISCOVERED UPON WHICH ITS RAYS ALSO FELL
AND BRAG ABOUT THEIR DRAINAGE CANAL I'VE SEEN A SOUTHERNER ON BEING INTRODUCED TO THE KING OF ENGLAND HAND THAT MONARCH WITHOUT BATTING HIS EYES THE INFORMATION THAT HIS GRAND AUNT ON HIS MOTHER'S SIDE WAS RELATED BY MARRIAGE TO THE PERKINSES OF CHARLESTON
AN UNFINISHED STORY WE NO LONGER GROAN AND HEAP ASHES UPON OUR HEADS WHEN THE FLAMES OF TOPHET ARE MENTIONED FOR EVEN THE PREACHERS HAVE BEGUN TO TELL US THAT GOD IS RADIUM OR ETHER OR SOME SCIENTIFIC COMPOUND
MILLY STEERED HER MAGNIFICENT WAY LIKE SOME GREAT LINER CLEAVING AMONG THE CANOES OF HOWLING SAVAGES OUR GODDESS OF GRUB WAS BUILT ON LINES SO MAJESTIC THAT THEY COULD BE FOLLOWED ONLY WITH AWE
I KNOW AN ESQUIMAU IN UPERNAVIK WHO SENDS TO CINCINNATI FOR HIS NECKTIES

WHEN THE GIRLS NAMED HIM AN UNDESERVING STIGMA WAS CAST UPON THE NOBLE FAMILY OF SWINE THE WORDS OF THREE LETTERS LESSON IN THE OLD BLUE SPELLING BOOK BEGINS WITH PIGGY'S BIOGRAPHY HE WAS FAT HE HAD THE SOUL OF A RAT
SHE ASKED ME TO GIVE IT TO YOU WHEN YOU HAD FOUND THE ONE YOU LOVED YOUNG ROCKWALL TOOK THE RING REVERENTLY AND TRIED IT ON HIS SMALLEST FINGER IT SLIPPED AS FAR AS THE SECOND JOINT AND STOPPED
BATHOS TRULY BUT MISTER TOOMEY SAT DOWN AT THE SIDE OF MISS PURDY MILLINERY AND THEIR HANDS CAME TOGETHER IN SYMPATHY THE TWO OLD MAIDS MISSES WALSH WHO COMPLAINED EVERY DAY ABOUT THE NOISE IN THE HALLS
DULCIE HURRIED HOMEWARD HER EYES WERE SHINING AND HER CHEEKS SHOWED THE DELICATE PINK OF LIFE'S REAL LIFE'S APPROACHING DAWN
BRIGHTLY BUT THE PERPENDICULAR LINE OF PERPLEXITY BETWEEN HIS BROWS WAS NOT SMOOTHED AWAY HE LAUGHED AND EVEN THEN IT DID NOT BUT HE ACCEPTED THE MOMENTARY DIVERSION GLAD TO MEET YOU PRINCE HE SAID GOOD HUMOUREDLY YES I'D SAY YOU WERE INCOG ALL RIGHT
THE PAINTER WAS A YOUNG SCRUB OUT OF THE WEST NAMED KRAFT WHO HAD A FAVOURITE FOOD AND A PET THEORY HIS PABULUM WAS AN UNQUENCHABLE BELIEF IN THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE
AND ONE MAY STAND ON A CHAIR AND DIG AT IT IN VAIN UNTIL ONE'S FINGERS ARE PINK AND BRUISED A HAIRPIN WILL NOT REMOVE IT THEREFORE LET US CALL IT IMMOVABLE SO DULCIE LIT THE GAS
WHY NOW THAT'S BAD ENOUGH ENTIRELY THE CHILDER THEY BE DIFFERENT IF TWAS A WOMAN I'D BE WILLIN FOR THEY LEAVE PEACE BEHIND EM WHEN THEY GO DISREGARDING THE THRUST MISSUS MC CASKEY CAUGHT HER HUSBAND'S ARM
I MAY NEED CARFARES OLD MAN DENNY HALL ROOM FOURTH FLOOR BACK WHO SAT ON THE LOWEST STEP TRYING TO READ A PAPER BY THE STREET LAMP TURNED OVER A PAGE TO FOLLOW UP THE ARTICLE ABOUT THE CARPENTERS STRIKE MISSUS MURPHY SHRIEKED TO THE MOON
AND SEE HIM HIDE OUT UNDER THE BED LIKE A MANGY PUP
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT SOMEBODY TAPPED LIGHTLY ON ANTHONY ROCKWALL'S DOOR
CAESAR HAD HIS BRUTUS THE COTTON HAS ITS BOLLWORM THE CHORUS GIRL HAS HER PITTSBURGER THE SUMMER BOARDER HAS HIS POISON IVY THE HERO HAS HIS CARNEGIE MEDAL ART HAS ITS MORGAN THE ROSE HAS ITS SPEAK I INTERRUPTED MUCH PERTURBED
BOTH MORPHEUS AND THE BIRD ARE INCOMPETENT WITNESSES AND YOUR LISTENER DARE NOT ATTACK YOUR RECITAL THE BASELESS FABRIC OF A VISION THEN SHALL FURNISH MY THEME
I WONDER IF YOU'D BE SO SUPERIOR AND SNIPPY IF YOU HAD TO LIVE ON SIX DOLLARS A WEEK
ONE WHO IF HE BRAGGED AT ALL WOULD BRAG OF HIS WHOLE ROUND GLOBE AGAINST THE MARTIANS AND THE INHABITANTS OF THE MOON EXPRESSION ON THESE SUBJECTS WAS PRECIPITATED FROM E RUSHMORE COGLAN BY THE THIRD CORNER TO OUR TABLE
CAME TO SIX CENTS AND TWO SUNDAY PAPERS ONE FOR THE PERSONAL COLUMN AND THE OTHER TO READ WERE TEN CENTS
I MUST MAKE A PRESCRIPTION THAT IS TO BE CALLED FOR SOON SAY SAID MC GOWAN LOOKING UP SUDDENLY SAY IKEY AIN'T THERE A DRUG OF SOME KIND
IT WAS HER OWN AND HERS ONLY THE ODOUR BROUGHT HER VIVIDLY ALMOST TANGIBLY BEFORE HIM THE WORLD OF FINANCE DWINDLED SUDDENLY TO A SPECK AND SHE WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM
WITH A FOUNTAIN PEN OVER HIS RIGHT EAR AND HIS HAIR HANGING IN DISORDERLY STRINGS OVER HIS FOREHEAD HIS WINDOW WAS OPEN FOR THE BELOVED JANITRESS SPRING HAD TURNED ON A LITTLE WARMTH THROUGH THE WAKING REGISTERS OF THE EARTH
IT'S THIS OLD BUSINESS THAT HAS DRIVEN EVERYTHING ELSE OUT OF YOUR HEAD FOR THE TIME
AND DREW THE APPROPRIATE RETURN OF A BREAD PUDDING IN AN EARTHEN DISH A HUNK OF SWISS CHEESE ACCURATELY THROWN BY HER HUSBAND STRUCK MISSUS MC CASKEY BELOW ONE EYE WHEN SHE REPLIED WITH A WELL AIMED COFFEE POT FULL OF A HOT BLACK SEMI FRAGRANT LIQUID
AND THIS DAY WAS HARVEY MAXWELL'S BUSY DAY THE TICKER BEGAN TO REEL OUT JERKILY ITS FITFUL COILS OF TAPE THE DESK TELEPHONE HAD A CHRONIC ATTACK OF BUZZING MEN BEGAN TO THRONG INTO THE OFFICE
THE BATTLE ACCORDING TO COURSES SHOULD HAVE ENDED
THE FIST OF E RUSHMORE COGLAN BANGED THE TABLE AND I WAS JARRED INTO SILENCE EXCUSE ME SAID HE BUT THAT'S A QUESTION I NEVER LIKE TO HEAR ASKED WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHERE A MAN IS FROM
TRYING TO COVER HE CHARGED UPON THE DESK OF THE STENOGRAPHER SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH A SMILE A SOFT PINK CREPT OVER HER CHEEK AND HER EYES WERE KIND AND FRANK
THERE AMID THE STEAM OF VEGETABLES AND THE VAPOURS OF ACRES OF HAM AND THE CRASH OF CROCKERY THE CLATTER OF STEEL THE SCREAMING OF SHORT ORDERS THE CRIES OF THE HUNGERING AND ALL THE HORRID TUMULT OF FEEDING MAN
AND HUNG THE BLACK TURBAN HAT WITH THE GOLD GREEN MACAW WING IN ITS ACCUSTOMED PLACE HE WHO HAS BEEN DENIED THE SPECTACLE OF A BUSY MANHATTAN BROKER DURING A RUSH OF BUSINESS IS HANDICAPPED FOR THE PROFESSION OF ANTHROPOLOGY
WE ARE ALL BROTHERS CHINAMEN ENGLISHMEN ZULUS PATAGONIANS AND THE PEOPLE IN THE BEND OF THE KAW RIVER SOME DAY ALL THIS PETTY PRIDE IN ONE'S CITY OR STATE OR SECTION OR COUNTRY WILL BE WIPED OUT
AH SAID ANTHONY KEENLY WHAT'S HER NAME RICHARD BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE LIBRARY FLOOR THERE WAS ENOUGH COMRADESHIP AND SYMPATHY IN THIS CRUDE OLD FATHER OF HIS TO DRAW HIS CONFIDENCE WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER
IT IS OF DRUGS OF THAT NATURE THAT PHARMACEUTISTS MUST HAVE MUCH CAREFULNESS TO YOU ALONE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WOULD I INTRUST A POWDER LIKE THAT BUT FOR YOU I SHALL MAKE IT AND YOU SHALL SEE HOW IT MAKES ROSY TO THINK OF YOU IKEY WENT BEHIND THE PRESCRIPTION DESK
SIX DOLLARS IS A LARGER AMOUNT I WILL TELL YOU HOW SHE LIVED ON SIX DOLLARS PER WEEK ONE AFTERNOON AT SIX
I'VE NOT MUCH CONTROL OF MY THOUGHTS BUT I'LL DO MY BEST SAID ISABEL HENRIETTA GAZED AT HER IN SILENCE FOR A PERIOD WHICH TRIED ISABEL'S PATIENCE SO THAT OUR HEROINE ADDED AT LAST
ISABEL ALWAYS FELT AN IMPULSE TO PULL OUT THE PINS NOT THAT SHE IMAGINED THEY INFLICTED ANY DAMAGE ON THE TOUGH OLD PARCHMENT BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HER HER AUNT MIGHT MAKE BETTER USE OF HER SHARPNESS
BUT SHE WAS NOTIFIED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS OCCASION OF THE FINITE CHARACTER OF BUNCHIE'S INTELLECT HITHERTO SHE HAD BEEN MAINLY STRUCK WITH ITS EXTENT
WHY INDEED SHOULD WE PERPETUALLY BE THINKING WHETHER THINGS ARE GOOD FOR US AS IF WE WERE PATIENTS LYING IN A HOSPITAL WHY SHOULD I BE SO AFRAID OF NOT DOING RIGHT AS IF IT MATTERED TO THE WORLD WHETHER I DO RIGHT OR WRONG
IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU DESIRE TO TREAT THEM NO WONDER YOU DON'T LIKE AMERICA IF YOU'VE NOT GOOD SERVANTS YOU'RE MISERABLE MISSUS TOUCHETT SERENELY SAID THEY'RE VERY BAD IN AMERICA BUT I'VE FIVE PERFECT ONES IN FLORENCE
A REAL LITTLE PASSIONATE FORCE TO SEE AT PLAY IS THE FINEST THING IN NATURE IT'S FINER THAN THE FINEST WORK OF ART THAN A GREEK BAS RELIEF
CASPAR GOODWOOD ISABEL READ THIS MISSIVE WITH SUCH DEEP ATTENTION THAT SHE HAD NOT PERCEIVED AN APPROACHING TREAD ON THE SOFT GRASS
THEY HAD BEEN CALLED ENCHANTING I CAN'T HELP IT ISABEL ANSWERED I THINK IT'S LOVELY TO BE SO QUIET AND REASONABLE AND SATISFIED I SHOULD LIKE TO BE LIKE THAT HEAVEN FORBID CRIED RALPH WITH ARDOUR
ISABEL'S ORIGINALITY WAS THAT SHE GAVE ONE AN IMPRESSION OF HAVING INTENTIONS OF HER OWN WHENEVER SHE EXECUTES THEM SAID RALPH MAY I BE THERE TO SEE IT DEVOLVED UPON HIM OF COURSE TO DO THE HONOURS OF THE PLACE
A CHANCE FOR WHAT A CHANCE TO DEVELOP OH MOSES EDMUND LUDLOW EXCLAIMED I HOPE SHE ISN'T GOING TO DEVELOP ANY MORE IF I WERE NOT SURE YOU ONLY SAID THAT FOR ARGUMENT
THE GENERAL APPLICATION OF HER CONFIDENCE HER SITUATION AT GARDENCOURT THEREFORE APPRECIATED AS WE HAVE SEEN HER TO BE BY ISABEL AND FULL OF APPRECIATION HERSELF OF THAT FREE PLAY OF INTELLIGENCE
RALPH MEANWHILE HANDED ISABEL HER CANDLESTICK HE HAD BEEN WATCHING HER IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM HER TEMPER WAS INVOLVED AN ACCIDENT THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING BUT IF HE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING OF A FLARE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED FOR THE GIRL SIMPLY LAUGHED A LITTLE
WOULD SAVOUR OF IMMODESTY EVEN OF ARROGANCE
YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT AT YOUR BLEST ALBANY MY DEAR ISABEL ROSE BLUSHING I WISH I WERE SHE SAID OH I SAY MOTHER RALPH BROKE OUT
ISABEL HAD LISTENED QUICKLY YOU'VE TOO MUCH POWER OF THOUGHT ABOVE ALL TOO MUCH CONSCIENCE RALPH ADDED IT'S OUT OF ALL REASON THE NUMBER OF THINGS YOU THINK WRONG PUT BACK YOUR WATCH DIET YOUR FEVER
DON'T YOU THINK SHE GETS ENOUGH AT HOME WELL SHE OUGHT TO GO ABROAD SAID MISSUS LUDLOW SHE'S JUST THE PERSON TO GO ABROAD AND YOU WANT THE OLD LADY TO TAKE HER IS THAT IT SHE HAS OFFERED TO TAKE HER SHE'S DYING TO HAVE ISABEL GO
ASKED ISABEL ABRUPTLY WHY AS A KIND OF COMPLIMENT A COMPLIMENT ON WHAT ON YOUR SO BEAUTIFULLY EXISTING HE LIKED ME TOO MUCH SHE PRESENTLY DECLARED THAT'S A WAY WE ALL HAVE
ARBITRARY OR CAPRICIOUS THEREFORE IT IS THAT I BELIEVE YOU WILL LET ME SEE YOU AGAIN YOU TOLD ME THAT I'M NOT DISAGREEABLE TO YOU AND I BELIEVE IT FOR I DON'T SEE WHY THAT SHOULD BE I SHALL ALWAYS THINK OF YOU
ISABEL SAID TO THIS YOUNG MAN THE DAY AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT SAN REMO SOMETHING I'VE THOUGHT MORE THAN ONCE OF ASKING YOU BY LETTER BUT THAT I'VE HESITATED ON THE WHOLE TO WRITE ABOUT FACE TO FACE NEVERTHELESS
BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL IT TO BE WRONG THAT SO LITTLE NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THEM AND THAT HER FAILURE REALLY VERY GRATUITOUS TO MAKE HERSELF IMPORTANT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD NOT MUCH TO DO WITH THE ACRIMONY OF HER ALLUSIONS TO HER HUSBAND'S ADOPTED COUNTRY
HAD NOT MADE AN IMPERTINENCE DO YOU SUPPOSE YOUR BROTHER'S SINCERE ISABEL ENQUIRED WITH A SMILE OH HE MUST BE YOU KNOW MILDRED EXCLAIMED QUICKLY
THAT I HOPE WILL NEVER BE WHEN I WROTE TO YOU FROM LIVERPOOL I SAID I HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO TELL YOU YOU'VE NEVER ASKED ME WHAT IT IS IS IT BECAUSE YOU'VE SUSPECTED SUSPECTED WHAT
THAT IT WAS ALTOGETHER A PAINFUL ONE NEVERTHELESS SHE MADE ANSWER TO HIS DECLARATION COLDLY ENOUGH JUST AS YOU PLEASE
SAID ISABEL I WANT VERY MUCH TO SEE THEM AT HOME SHE HAD THIS PLEASURE A FEW DAYS LATER WHEN WITH RALPH AND HIS MOTHER SHE DROVE OVER TO LOCKLEIGH
OF LATE IT WAS NOT TO BE DENIED LITERATURE HAD SEEMED A FADING LIGHT AND EVEN AFTER SHE HAD REMINDED HERSELF THAT HER UNCLE'S LIBRARY WAS PROVIDED WITH A COMPLETE SET OF THOSE AUTHORS WHICH NO GENTLEMAN'S COLLECTION SHOULD BE WITHOUT
A LARGE FORTUNE MEANS FREEDOM AND I'M AFRAID OF THAT IT'S SUCH A FINE THING AND ONE SHOULD MAKE SUCH A GOOD USE OF IT IF ONE SHOULDN'T ONE WOULD BE ASHAMED AND ONE MUST KEEP THINKING IT'S A CONSTANT EFFORT
HIS USELESS LIFE HIS FANTASTIC MOTHER
SHE ASKED OF HER AUNT WHEN YOU CRITICISE EVERYTHING HERE YOU SHOULD HAVE A POINT OF VIEW YOURS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AMERICAN YOU THOUGHT EVERYTHING OVER THERE SO DISAGREEABLE WHEN I CRITICISE I HAVE MINE IT'S THOROUGHLY AMERICAN
I LIKE TO BE TREATED AS AN AMERICAN LADY POOR AMERICAN LADIES CRIED MISSUS TOUCHETT WITH A LAUGH THEY'RE THE SLAVES OF SLAVES THEY'RE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN HENRIETTA RETORTED
HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF COURSE THAT IT HAD BEEN A SMALL KINDNESS TO HIS FATHER TO WISH THAT OF THE TWO THE ACTIVE RATHER THAN THE PASSIVE PARTY SHOULD KNOW THE FELT WOUND HE REMEMBERED THAT THE OLD MAN HAD ALWAYS TREATED HIS OWN FORECAST OF AN EARLY END AS A CLEVER FALLACY
HIS COUSIN WAS A VERY BRILLIANT GIRL
IT KEEPS THE SOUNDS OF THE WORLD FROM REACHING THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS AND IT MAKES THE WORLD THINK THAT DANCING'S GOING ON WITHIN
YOU'RE A CAPITAL PERSON TO ADVISE SAID RALPH YOU TAKE THE WIND OUT OF MY SAILS SHE LOOKED AT HIM AS IF SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM THOUGH SHE WAS FOLLOWING OUT THE TRAIN OF REFLEXION WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD KINDLED
I COULD HAVE TALKED A LONG TIME TO SUCH A LISTENER HE WAS SO QUIET SO INTENSE HE DRANK IT ALL IN WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT ME ISABEL ASKED I SAID YOU WERE ON THE WHOLE THE FINEST CREATURE I KNOW
SHOULD YOU LIKE ME BETTER IF I WERE YOUR BUTLER DEAR HER HUSBAND ASKED I DON'T THINK I SHOULD YOU WOULDN'T AT ALL HAVE THE TENUE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN I LIKE THAT MISS STACKPOLE SAID RALPH
AND IN THAT TIME A GREAT MANY THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN SHE HAD INDEED FAILED TO SAY TO HERSELF THAT HER AMERICAN SUITOR MIGHT FIND SOME OTHER GIRL MORE COMFORTABLE TO WOO BECAUSE THOUGH IT WAS CERTAIN MANY OTHER GIRLS WOULD PROVE SO
SHE COMMUNICATED HER DISBELIEF TO HER FRIEND FOR THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS NEVERTHELESS SHE STOOD PREPARED TO HEAR THE YOUNG MAN'S NAME ANNOUNCED THE FEELING PRESSED UPON HER IT MADE THE AIR SULTRY
SHOULD CULTIVATE A SCAR OUT OF PROPORTION TO ANY WOUND ENGLISHMEN LIKED MOREOVER TO BE COMFORTABLE SAID ISABEL AND THERE COULD BE LITTLE COMFORT FOR LORD WARBURTON IN THE LONG RUN IN BROODING OVER A SELF SUFFICIENT AMERICAN GIRL
AND TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION AT A LOW TEMPERATURE THE POOR GIRL LIKED TO BE THOUGHT CLEVER BUT SHE HATED TO BE THOUGHT BOOKISH
IT MUST BE SAID THAT HER WIT WAS EXERCISED TO A LARGE EXTENT IN SELF DEFENCE FOR HER COUSIN AMUSED HIMSELF WITH CALLING HER COLUMBIA AND ACCUSING HER OF A PATRIOTISM SO HEATED THAT IT SCORCHED HE DREW A CARICATURE OF HER
BUT SHE FALTERED BEFORE HER FRIEND'S IMPLACABLE GLITTER MY DEAR CHILD YOU CERTAINLY ENCOURAGED HIM ISABEL MADE FOR THE MOMENT AS IF TO DENY THIS CHARGE INSTEAD OF WHICH HOWEVER SHE PRESENTLY ANSWERED
SHE WAS GLAD TO PAUSE HOWEVER ON THE EDGE OF THIS LARGER ADVENTURE THERE WAS SUCH A THRILL EVEN IN THE PRELIMINARY HOVERING IT AFFECTED HER MOREOVER AS A PEACEFUL INTERLUDE AS A HUSH OF THE DRUM AND FIFE IN A CAREER WHICH SHE HAD LITTLE WARRANT
SHE HAD OFTEN REMARKED IN SPITE OF WHICH HOWEVER SHE HELD HER RATHER WISTFULLY IN SIGHT
HE WAS ALSO LEAN AND BROWN HE WAS NOT ROMANTICALLY HE WAS MUCH RATHER OBSCURELY HANDSOME BUT HIS PHYSIOGNOMY HAD AN AIR
YOU CAN'T DO SO IF YOUR ATTENTION IS DISTRACTED BY IRRELEVANT GOSSIP HIS OWN CONVERSATION
WHILE HE BRUSHED HIS HAT I'M SURE I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT EXCLAIMED THE GIRL
BUT LORD WARBURTON EXERCISED SOME INGENUITY IN ENGAGING HIS LEAST FAMILIAR GUEST IN A STROLL APART FROM THE OTHERS I WISH YOU TO SEE THE PLACE PROPERLY SERIOUSLY HE SAID
TIME ENOUGH TO INSTITUTE A SEARCH FOR A RICH ECCLESIASTICISM AND GIVE IT UP AS VAIN
SHE LIVED IN ABUNDANT OPPORTUNITY FOR DANCING PLENTY OF NEW DRESSES THE LONDON SPECTATOR THE LATEST PUBLICATIONS THE MUSIC OF GOUNOD THE POETRY OF BROWNING THE PROSE OF GEORGE ELIOT THESE THINGS NOW AS MEMORY PLAYED OVER THEM
ISABEL RESPONDED YOU SAY THAT RIGHT I HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TALK WITH HIM HE HAS COME AFTER YOU DID HE TELL YOU SO NO HE TOLD ME NOTHING THAT'S HOW I KNEW IT SAID HENRIETTA CLEVERLY
AS TO WHOM THE PROPOSAL OF AN OWNERSHIP DIVIDED WITH HER COUSIN HAD BEEN APPLIED AS IMPARTIALLY AS POSSIBLE AS IMPARTIALLY AS BUNCHIE'S OWN SOMEWHAT FICKLE AND INCONSTANT SYMPATHIES WOULD ALLOW
HENRIETTA DOESN'T OH HANG HENRIETTA SAID RALPH COARSELY IF YOU ASK ME I'M DELIGHTED AT IT IS THAT WHY YOUR FATHER DID IT FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT I DIFFER WITH MISS STACKPOLE
WITH WHOM SHE TALKED A GREAT DEAL AND WITH WHOM HER CONVERSATION WAS OF A SORT THAT GAVE A LARGE LICENCE TO EXTRAVAGANCE HER COUSIN USED AS THE PHRASE IS TO CHAFF HER
HE HAD BEEN DEEPLY AFFECTED THIS SHE BELIEVED AND SHE WAS STILL CAPABLE OF DERIVING PLEASURE FROM THE BELIEF BUT IT WAS ABSURD THAT A MAN BOTH SO INTELLIGENT AND SO HONOURABLY DEALT WITH
TOO INDIFFERENT TO SORDID CONSIDERATIONS
SHE'D KEEP PEOPLE OFF VERY WELL I THINK
SHE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST BELIEF THAT THIS MERIT WOULD ATTRACT HIM BUT SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE HERSELF MIGHT KNOW THE HUMILIATION OF CHANGE MIGHT REALLY FOR THAT MATTER COME TO THE END OF THE THINGS THAT WERE NOT CASPAR
AH BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S VISIT TO MAKE ONE FEEL GRAND OH EXCLAIMED LUDLOW SHE'S GRANDER THAN EVER WHENEVER I FEEL GRAND SAID THE GIRL IT WILL BE FOR A BETTER REASON
HE HAD INDEED RATHER SHARPLY REGISTERED HIMSELF ON HER FINE SENSE AND SHE HAD THOUGHT OF HIM SEVERAL TIMES SHE HAD HOPED SHE SHOULD SEE HIM AGAIN HOPED TOO THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A FEW OTHERS GARDENCOURT WAS NOT DULL
I'M SURE SHE HAS LIVED ALL HER LIFE IN A BOARDING HOUSE AND I DETEST THE MANNERS AND THE LIBERTIES OF SUCH PLACES IF YOU ASK ME IF I PREFER MY OWN MANNERS WHICH YOU DOUBTLESS THINK VERY BAD I'LL TELL YOU THAT I PREFER THEM IMMENSELY
SHE HAD HAD THE BEST OF EVERYTHING AND IN A WORLD IN WHICH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SO MANY PEOPLE MADE THEM UNENVIABLE IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE NEVER TO HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING PARTICULARLY UNPLEASANT
BETWEEN HEDGEROWS MADE THICK BY MIDSUMMER WHEN THEY REACHED HOME THEY USUALLY FOUND TEA HAD BEEN SERVED ON THE LAWN
BUT ISABEL CHALLENGED THIS ASSERTION WITH A GOOD DEAL OF SERIOUSNESS YOU MUST NOT SAY THAT LILY I DON'T FEEL GRAND AT ALL I'M SURE THERE'S NO HARM SAID THE CONCILIATORY LILY
MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS RIGHT IN GUESSING THAT HENRIETTA DISAPPROVED OF HER BUT SHE HAD NOT QUITE PUT HER FINGER ON THE REASON A DAY OR TWO AFTER MISS STACKPOLE'S ARRIVAL
THAT AN INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED WHICH MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO PUT HER GOOD HUMOUR TO THE TEST
THEY'RE THE COMPANIONS OF THEIR SERVANTS THE IRISH CHAMBERMAID AND THE NEGRO WAITER THEY SHARE THEIR WORK DO YOU CALL THE DOMESTICS IN AN AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD SLAVES MISS STACKPOLE ENQUIRED
IF I BELIEVED THAT I SHOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY FORTUNATELY I DON'T BELIEVE IT I WANT TO BE TREATED WITH JUSTICE I WANT NOTHING BUT THAT VERY GOOD BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT JUSTICE TO A LOVELY BEING
SAID MILDRED THE YOUNGER SISTER AT THE SAME TIME WARBURTON'S VERY REASONABLE MISS MOLYNEUX OBSERVED
OF LAUGHING AT ALL THINGS BEGINNING WITH HIMSELF SUCH SLENDER FACULTY OF REVERENCE AS HE POSSESSED CENTRED WHOLLY UPON HIS FATHER FOR THE REST HE EXERCISED HIS WIT INDIFFERENTLY UPON HIS FATHER'S SON THIS GENTLEMAN'S WEAK LUNGS
YES THAT'S WHAT YOU ENJOY MOST I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT YOU'RE UP TO SAID LORD WARBURTON
CRIED LORD WARBURTON STILL WITH HIS SONOROUS MIRTH MY EXCUSE FOR NOT ROWING IS THAT MY COUSIN ROWS SO WELL SAID RALPH SHE DOES EVERYTHING WELL SHE TOUCHES NOTHING THAT SHE DOESN'T ADORN
I THINK ONE OUGHT TO BE LIBERAL MILDRED ARGUED GENTLY WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN SO EVEN FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES
IS AFTER ALL A FLORID SORT OF SENTIMENT I'M NOT A LOVELY BEING HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I'M ASKING SUCH ODIOUS QUESTIONS I MUST SEEM TO YOU DELICATE
ISABEL SAID TO HERSELF THAT IT BESPOKE RESOLUTION TO NIGHT IN SPITE OF WHICH IN HALF AN HOUR CASPAR GOODWOOD WHO HAD ARRIVED HOPEFUL AS WELL AS RESOLUTE TOOK HIS WAY BACK TO HIS LODGING WITH THE FEELING OF A MAN DEFEATED
WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS GREATLY ADMIRED IF HIS COUSIN WERE TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN AN ENTERTAINMENT TO HIM RALPH WAS CONSCIOUS SHE WAS AN ENTERTAINMENT OF A HIGH ORDER A CHARACTER LIKE THAT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
FRESH COMPLEXIONS AND SOMETHING OF THE SMILE OF CHILDHOOD YES THEIR EYES WHICH ISABEL ADMIRED WERE ROUND QUIET AND CONTENTED
THE FATHER AND SON HAD BEEN CLOSE COMPANIONS AND THE IDEA OF BEING LEFT ALONE WITH THE REMNANT OF A TASTELESS LIFE ON HIS HANDS WAS NOT GRATIFYING TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ALWAYS AND TACITLY COUNTED UPON HIS ELDER'S HELP IN MAKING THE BEST OF A POOR BUSINESS
ONLY I BEG IT SHALL NOT BE BEFORE MIDNIGHT
ABOVE ALL WITH RIGHTNESS OF EFFECT NINETEEN PERSONS OUT OF TWENTY INCLUDING THE YOUNGER SISTER HERSELF
BUT WHICH HE HAD NOW CEASED TO ENJOY ISABEL ENJOYED IT LARGELY AND HANDLING THE REINS IN A MANNER WHICH APPROVED ITSELF TO THE GROOM AS KNOWING WAS NEVER WEARY OF DRIVING HER UNCLE'S CAPITAL HORSES THROUGH WINDING LANES AND BYWAYS
WHICH HE SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO DISCREDIT SO FAR AS HE MIGHT BY DYING FIRST BUT OF THE TWO TRIUMPHS THAT OF REFUTING A SOPHISTICAL SON AND THAT OF HOLDING ON A WHILE LONGER TO A STATE OF BEING WHICH WITH ALL ABATEMENTS HE ENJOYED
EXCEPT THAT SHE'S SO ORIGINAL WELL I DON'T LIKE ORIGINALS I LIKE TRANSLATIONS MISTER LUDLOW HAD MORE THAN ONCE REPLIED
OF MISSUS TOUCHETT'S APPEARANCE AND IN THE EVENING PREPARED TO COMPLY WITH THEIR AUNT'S COMMANDS OF WHAT ISABEL THEN SAID NO REPORT HAS REMAINED
I NEEDN'T BE SO TERRIBLY EMANCIPATED DOUBTLESS NOT AND YET AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T THINK YOUR UNCLE LIKES ME YOU'RE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN
SHE OUGHT TO MARRY AN ARMENIAN OR A PORTUGUESE
IT APPEARED TO ISABEL THAT THE UNPLEASANT HAD BEEN EVEN TOO ABSENT FROM HER KNOWLEDGE FOR SHE HAD GATHERED FROM HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH LITERATURE THAT IT WAS OFTEN A SOURCE OF INTEREST AND EVEN OF INSTRUCTION
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU SHE OBSERVED TO HIM ONCE BUT I SUSPECT YOU'RE A GREAT HUMBUG THAT'S YOUR PRIVILEGE RALPH ANSWERED WHO HAD NOT BEEN USED TO BEING SO CRUDELY ADDRESSED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CARE FOR
WELL NOW THERE'S A SPECIMEN HE SAID TO HER AS THEY WALKED UP FROM THE RIVERSIDE AND HE RECOGNISED LORD WARBURTON A SPECIMEN OF WHAT ASKED THE GIRL A SPECIMEN OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN DO YOU MEAN THEY'RE ALL LIKE HIM
THAN SPOKE THEIR GOOD WISHES
ISABEL PRESENTLY FOUND HERSELF IN THE SINGULAR SITUATION OF DEFENDING THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION AGAINST HER AUNT
WHENEVER SHE STROLLED UPON THE SHORE WITH HER COUSIN AND SHE WAS THE COMPANION OF HIS DAILY WALK SHE LOOKED ACROSS THE SEA WITH LONGING EYES TO WHERE SHE KNEW THAT GENOA LAY
GROWN USED TO FEELING RICH THE CONSCIOUSNESS IN QUESTION FOUND A PROPER PLACE IN RATHER A DENSE LITTLE GROUP OF IDEAS THAT SHE HAD ABOUT HERSELF AND OFTEN IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE LEAST AGREEABLE
SHE SHOULD RECEIVE THE NEWS WITHOUT A PANG EVEN OF SURPRISE IT WOULD HAVE PROVED THAT HE BELIEVED SHE WAS FIRM WHICH WAS WHAT SHE WISHED TO SEEM TO HIM
THEY'RE NOT MORBID AT ANY RATE
THAT WHEN RALPH WISHED TO SEE HER HE WAS AT LIBERTY TO REMEMBER THAT PALAZZO CRESCENTINI CONTAINED A LARGE APARTMENT KNOWN AS THE QUARTER OF THE SIGNORINO I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING
I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU WANT WITH FIVE HENRIETTA COULDN'T HELP OBSERVING I DON'T THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE FIVE PERSONS SURROUNDING ME IN THAT MENIAL POSITION
HIS ADOPTED AND HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HIS CHARMING NEW FOUND COUSIN I KEEP A BAND OF MUSIC IN MY ANTE ROOM HE SAID ONCE TO HER IT HAS ORDERS TO PLAY WITHOUT STOPPING IT RENDERS ME TWO EXCELLENT SERVICES
SAID ISABEL SERIOUSLY WELL YOU THINK US QUAINT' THAT'S THE SAME THING
SHE WAS ABSORBED IN THE ALARM GIVEN HER BY HENRIETTA'S INTIMATION THAT CASPAR GOODWOOD WOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT GARDENCOURT SHE PRETENDED TO HERSELF HOWEVER THAT SHE THOUGHT THE EVENT IMPOSSIBLE AND LATER
YOU'RE EASILY CHARMED MY LORD
PROPERTY ERECTS A KIND OF BARRIER YOU CAN DO A GREAT MANY THINGS IF YOU'RE RICH WHICH WOULD BE SEVERELY CRITICISED IF YOU WERE POOR YOU CAN GO AND COME YOU CAN TRAVEL ALONE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN ESTABLISHMENT
BUT ISABEL WAS IN A SITUATION THAT GAVE A VALUE TO ANY CHANGE SHE HAD A DESIRE TO LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND HER AND AS SHE SAID TO HERSELF TO BEGIN AFRESH THIS DESIRE INDEED WAS NOT A BIRTH OF THE PRESENT OCCASION
BUT THIS OF COURSE WAS BETWEEN THEMSELVES
THEY TOOK A BOAT ON THE RIVER THE DEAR LITTLE RIVER AS ISABEL CALLED IT WHERE THE OPPOSITE SHORE SEEMED STILL A PART OF THE FOREGROUND OF THE LANDSCAPE OR DROVE OVER THE COUNTRY IN A PHAETON A LOW CAPACIOUS THICK WHEELED PHAETON
MADAME MERLE HAD PREDICTED TO MISSUS TOUCHETT THAT AFTER THEIR YOUNG FRIEND HAD PUT HER HAND INTO HER POCKET HALF A DOZEN TIMES SHE WOULD BE RECONCILED TO THE IDEA THAT IT HAD BEEN FILLED BY A MUNIFICENT UNCLE
SHE WOULD BE AS AMERICAN AS IT PLEASED HIM TO REGARD HER AND IF HE CHOSE TO LAUGH AT HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM PLENTY OF OCCUPATION SHE DEFENDED ENGLAND AGAINST HIS MOTHER BUT WHEN RALPH SANG ITS PRAISES ON PURPOSE AS SHE SAID TO WORK HER UP
YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU GAVE ME MY DISMISSAL AT ALBANY THREE MONTHS AGO I DID NOT ACCEPT IT I PROTESTED AGAINST IT YOU IN FACT APPEARED TO ACCEPT MY PROTEST AND TO ADMIT THAT I HAD THE RIGHT ON MY SIDE
AND FOUND HENRIETTA WANTING IN DELICACY I ASKED HIM AND HE SAID HE MEANT TO DO NOTHING MISS STACKPOLE ANSWERED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE'S NOT A MAN TO DO NOTHING HE IS A MAN OF HIGH BOLD ACTION
AT A TIME WHEN HIS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF A BURDEN TO HIM HER SUDDEN ARRIVAL WHICH PROMISED NOTHING AND WAS AN OPEN HANDED GIFT OF FATE HAD REFRESHED AND QUICKENED THEM GIVEN THEM WINGS AND SOMETHING TO FLY FOR
BUT THE TWO FOR THE MOST PART SAT SILENT THE OLD MAN WITH HIS HEAD BACK AND HIS EYES CLOSED HIS WIFE OCCUPIED WITH HER KNITTING AND WEARING THAT APPEARANCE OF RARE PROFUNDITY WITH WHICH SOME LADIES CONSIDER THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR NEEDLES
BUT HIS WIFE REMAINED IN THE DRAWING ROOM WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PARTY SHE PROLONGED HER VIGIL FOR SOMETHING LESS THAN AN HOUR AND THEN RISING OBSERVED TO ISABEL THAT IT WAS TIME THEY SHOULD BID THE GENTLEMEN GOOD NIGHT ISABEL HAD AS YET NO DESIRE TO GO TO BED
THEY HAD LIVED WITH NURSEMAIDS AND GOVERNESSES USUALLY VERY BAD ONES OR HAD BEEN SENT TO SUPERFICIAL SCHOOLS KEPT BY THE FRENCH FROM WHICH AT THE END OF A MONTH THEY HAD BEEN REMOVED IN TEARS THIS VIEW OF THE MATTER WOULD HAVE EXCITED
SHE WAS REASSURED QUICKLY ENOUGH BY HER SENSE OF HIS GREAT GOOD MANNERS
SHE HAD THOUGHT IT VERY POSSIBLE HE WOULD COME IN
FOR WHAT IS USUALLY CALLED SOCIAL INTERCOURSE SHE HAD VERY LITTLE RELISH BUT NOTHING PLEASED HER MORE THAN TO FIND HER HALL TABLE WHITENED WITH OBLONG MORSELS OF SYMBOLIC PASTEBOARD SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS A VERY JUST WOMAN
WHICH SHE PRIVATELY JUDGED TO BE A MYSTERIOUS SURVIVAL OF FEUDALISM IT WAS PERHAPS BECAUSE HER MIND WAS OPPRESSED WITH THIS IMAGE THAT SHE SUFFERED SOME DAYS TO ELAPSE BEFORE SHE TOOK OCCASION TO SAY TO ISABEL
THAN A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL IT'S VERY PLEASANT TO BE SO WELL TREATED WHERE ONE HAD LEAST LOOKED FOR IT I HAD NEVER BEEN MORE BLUE MORE BORED THAN FOR A WEEK BEFORE SHE CAME I HAD NEVER EXPECTED LESS THAT ANYTHING PLEASANT WOULD HAPPEN
SHE HAD HEARD THE SOUND BEFORE AND SHE RECOGNISED IT
A CLEAR AND QUIET HARBOUR ENCLOSED BY A BRAVE GRANITE BREAKWATER BUT THAT DAY COULD ONLY COME IN ITS ORDER AND SHE COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT WITH FOLDED HANDS THAT LORD WARBURTON SHOULD CONTINUE TO CHERISH HER IMAGE
SAID ISABEL BECAUSE I'M SURE HE'S NICE
SO VERY MUCH MORE FETCHING
SEEMED TO HER MORE THAN A NOBLE HUMILITY OR AN ENLIGHTENED PRIDE OUGHT TO WISH TO RECKON WITH SHE HAD SO DEFINITELY UNDERTAKEN TO PRESERVE NO RECORD OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THAT A CORRESPONDING EFFORT ON HIS OWN PART
YOU SEEM TO ME TROUBLED SAID RALPH I AM TROUBLED ABOUT WHAT FOR A MOMENT SHE ANSWERED NOTHING THEN SHE BROKE OUT DO YOU THINK IT GOOD FOR ME SUDDENLY TO BE MADE SO RICH
LORD WARBURTON HAD BEEN RIGHT ABOUT HER SHE WAS A REALLY INTERESTING LITTLE FIGURE RALPH WONDERED HOW THEIR NEIGHBOUR HAD FOUND IT OUT SO SOON AND THEN HE SAID IT WAS ONLY ANOTHER PROOF OF HIS FRIEND'S HIGH ABILITIES
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION WHEN I SAID FREEMEN I DIDN'T MEAN YOU SIR AND THIS WAS THE ONLY REWARD THAT RALPH GOT FOR HIS COMPLIMENT MISS STACKPOLE WAS BAFFLED
AND WHATEVER HE DOES WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT I QUITE BELIEVE THAT HENRIETTA MIGHT BE WANTING IN DELICACY BUT IT TOUCHED THE GIRL ALL THE SAME TO HEAR THIS DECLARATION AH YOU DO CARE FOR HIM HER VISITOR RANG OUT
ISABEL CONSIDERED I'M NOT VEXED BUT I'M SURPRISED AND A GOOD DEAL MYSTIFIED WASN'T IT PROPER I SHOULD REMAIN IN THE DRAWING ROOM NOT IN THE LEAST YOUNG GIRLS HERE IN DECENT HOUSES
THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE THE LONGEST WAY ROUND TO FLORENCE IN ORDER TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS WITH HER INVALID SON
WHO HAD ELOPED WITH A RUSSIAN NOBLEMAN STAYING AT THE SAME HOTEL EVEN IN THIS IRREGULAR SITUATION AN INCIDENT OF THE GIRL'S ELEVENTH YEAR
DO YOU THINK HE WOULD STAND THE TEST THE TEST I
AND HER SATISFACTION WAS AT THE ROOT OF THE GOOD SPIRITS WHICH ENABLED HER TO TAKE HER COUSIN'S CHAFF
OF THE CHOREOGRAPHIC CIRCLE HER SISTER
THIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCUSSION HOWEVER MISS STACKPOLE REJECTED WITH SCORN MIDDLING INDEED IF THEY WERE NOT THE BEST IN THE WORLD THEY WERE THE WORST BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MIDDLING ABOUT AN AMERICAN HOTEL
A GREEK BAS RELIEF TO STICK OVER MY CHIMNEY PIECE THE KEY OF A BEAUTIFUL EDIFICE IS THRUST INTO MY HAND AND I'M TOLD TO WALK IN AND ADMIRE MY POOR BOY YOU'VE BEEN SADLY UNGRATEFUL
RALPH WILL LIGHT MY CANDLE ISABEL GAILY ENGAGED I'LL LIGHT YOUR CANDLE DO LET ME LIGHT YOUR CANDLE MISS ARCHER
I SHOULD FEEL VERY BADLY HIS WIFE REPLIED BUT YOU KNOW YOU LOVE HER
LIVE AS YOU LIKE BEST AND YOUR CHARACTER WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF MOST THINGS ARE GOOD FOR YOU THE EXCEPTIONS ARE VERY RARE AND A COMFORTABLE INCOME'S NOT ONE OF THEM RALPH PAUSED SMILING
AS THE TWO WERE MAKING READY FOR THEIR VISIT I DO HOPE IMMENSELY SHE'LL DO SOMETHING HANDSOME FOR ISABEL SHE HAS EVIDENTLY TAKEN A GREAT FANCY TO HER WHAT IS IT YOU WISH HER TO DO EDMUND LUDLOW ASKED
HER VISITORS FLUSHED AND HER COUSIN TOLD HER AFTER THEY WERE GONE THAT IF SHE SAID SUCH THINGS TO THOSE POOR GIRLS THEY WOULD THINK SHE WAS IN SOME WILD FREE MANNER PRACTISING ON THEM
AS IT WERE QUITE CAPABLE OF FLOORING HIS MAN
AND SHE DEEMED THIS A GREAT CHARM FOR TWO OR THREE OF THE FRIENDS OF HER GIRLHOOD HAD BEEN REGRETTABLY OPEN TO THE CHARGE
HE TOOK A RESOLVE AFTER THIS NOT TO MISINTERPRET HER WORDS EVEN WHEN MISS STACKPOLE APPEARED TO STRIKE THE PERSONAL NOTE MOST STRONGLY HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF THAT PERSONS IN HER VIEW WERE SIMPLE AND HOMOGENEOUS ORGANISMS
TO HOPE WHAT THAT IN FUTURE I MAY SEE YOU OFTEN
A PASTIME FOR WHICH THE WEATHER REMAINED FAVOURABLE WITH A PERSISTENCY NOT ALLOWED FOR IN ISABEL'S SOMEWHAT LUGUBRIOUS PREVISION OF THE CLIMATE AND IN THE LONG AFTERNOONS OF WHICH THE LENGTH WAS BUT THE MEASURE OF HER GRATIFIED EAGERNESS
IS THERE ANYTHING MYSTERIOUS IN A PURPOSE ENTERTAINED AND EXECUTED EVERY YEAR IN THE MOST PUBLIC MANNER BY FIFTY THOUSAND OF MY FELLOW COUNTRYMEN THE PURPOSE OF IMPROVING ONE'S MIND BY FOREIGN TRAVEL
I'M GLAD YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT ME SAID LORD WARBURTON BUT I NEVERTHELESS DON'T THINK HE'D LIKE ME TO KEEP COMING TO GARDENCOURT
I SHALL NEVER THINK OF ANY ONE ELSE I CAME TO ENGLAND SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE I COULDN'T STAY AT HOME AFTER YOU HAD GONE I HATED THE COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT IN IT IF I LIKE THIS COUNTRY AT PRESENT
ESPECIALLY THE LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE
OF THEIR OPINIONS ISABEL WAS NEVER VERY DEFINITELY INFORMED
EITHER TO CASPAR GOODWOOD OR TO LORD WARBURTON AND YET COULDN'T BUT FEEL THEM APPRECIABLY IN DEBT TO HER SHE HAD OF COURSE REMINDED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS TO HEAR FROM MISTER GOODWOOD AGAIN BUT THIS WAS NOT TO BE FOR ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF
THEN SHE ROSE AND MOVED ABOUT THE ROOM AND FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER PREFERRING THE PLACES WHERE THE VAGUE LAMPLIGHT EXPIRED SHE WAS RESTLESS AND EVEN AGITATED AT MOMENTS SHE TREMBLED A
ONE SHOULD GET AS MANY NEW IDEAS AS POSSIBLE YES BUT THEY SHOULDN'T INTERFERE WITH THE OLD ONES WHEN THE OLD ONES HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT ONES ISABEL TURNED ABOUT AGAIN IF YOU MEAN THAT I HAD ANY IDEA WITH REGARD TO MISTER GOODWOOD
OF WHICH EVEN AT A DISTANCE THE DESULTORY CHARACTER WAS APPRECIABLE WITH
I DON'T THINK YOU CARE FOR ANYTHING YOU DON'T REALLY CARE FOR ENGLAND WHEN YOU PRAISE IT YOU DON'T CARE FOR AMERICA EVEN WHEN YOU PRETEND TO ABUSE IT I CARE FOR NOTHING BUT YOU DEAR COUSIN SAID RALPH IF I COULD BELIEVE
WHERE THEY LIVED WITH THEIR BROTHER AND THEN THEY MIGHT SEE HER VERY VERY OFTEN THEY WONDERED IF SHE WOULDN'T COME OVER SOME DAY AND SLEEP THEY WERE EXPECTING SOME PEOPLE ON THE TWENTY NINTH SO PERHAPS SHE WOULD COME WHILE THE PEOPLE WERE THERE
SO LITTLE SURFACE OFFERED SO LIMITED A FACE TO THE ACCRETIONS OF HUMAN CONTACT NOTHING TENDER NOTHING SYMPATHETIC HAD EVER HAD A CHANCE TO FASTEN UPON IT
FULL OF THE RURAL INCIDENTS SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND PAST COTTAGES THATCHED AND TIMBERED PAST ALE HOUSES LATTICED AND SANDED PAST PATCHES OF ANCIENT COMMON AND GLIMPSES OF EMPTY PARKS
AND HIS WIFE'S POSITION WAS THAT OF RATHER A GRIM VISITOR SO THAT IN THE LINE OF CONDUCT THAT OPENED ITSELF TO RALPH DUTY AND INCLINATION WERE HARMONIOUSLY MIXED HE WAS NOT A GREAT WALKER BUT HE STROLLED ABOUT THE GROUNDS WITH HIS COUSIN
WHEN LORD WARBURTON SHOWED HER THE HOUSE AFTER LUNCHEON IT SEEMED TO HER A MATTER OF COURSE THAT IT SHOULD BE A NOBLE PICTURE WITHIN IT HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL MODERNISED SOME OF ITS BEST POINTS HAD LOST THEIR PURITY
IN WHICH THE DIFFICULTY OF DOING AS ONE LIKED APPEARED TO INCREASE AS ONE GREW OLDER HAD BEEN SENSIBLY MODIFIED BY THE PAIN OF SEPARATION FROM HIS CLEVER HIS SUPERIOR HIS REMARKABLE GIRL LATER WHEN THE JOURNEYS TO EUROPE CEASED
WERE ENCASED IN SEALSKIN JACKETS THEIR FRIENDLINESS WAS GREAT SO GREAT THAT THEY WERE ALMOST EMBARRASSED TO SHOW IT THEY SEEMED SOMEWHAT AFRAID OF THE YOUNG LADY FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD AND RATHER LOOKED
OF REQUESTING YOUR ATTENTION WHICH IT REWARDED ACCORDING TO THE CHARM YOU FOUND IN BLUE EYES OF REMARKABLE FIXEDNESS THE EYES OF A COMPLEXION OTHER THAN HIS OWN AND A JAW OF THE SOMEWHAT ANGULAR MOULD WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BESPEAK RESOLUTION
AND AT IMPORTANT MOMENTS WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN THANKFUL TO MAKE USE OF HER JUDGEMENT ALONE SHE PAID THE PENALTY OF HAVING GIVEN UNDUE ENCOURAGEMENT
AS YET FOR REGARDING AS AGITATED BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PICTURING TO HERSELF BY THE LIGHT OF HER HOPES HER FEARS HER FANCIES HER AMBITIONS HER PREDILECTIONS
WHICH IN SPITE OF INCREASING DISTANCE WERE STILL SUFFICIENTLY SALIENT THEY WERE RECOGNISABLE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
OF A YOUNG LADY WHO HAD CONFIDED IN HIS HOSPITALITY SHE WAS RIGHT IN TRUSTING TO HIS GOOD MANNERS FOR HE PRESENTLY WENT ON LAUGHING A LITTLE AND WITHOUT A TRACE OF THE ACCENT THAT HAD DISCOMPOSED HER
BUT HIS EYES ASKED IT AND HIS HANDSHAKE WHEN HE BADE ME GOOD BYE THANK YOU FOR DOING SO AND ISABEL TURNED AWAY YES YOU'RE CHANGED YOU'VE GOT NEW IDEAS OVER HERE HER FRIEND CONTINUED I HOPE SO SAID ISABEL
OH NO THEY'RE NOT ALL LIKE HIM
HE VERY SOON ESTABLISHED WITH HER A REPUTATION FOR TREATING EVERYTHING AS A JOKE AND HE WAS NOT A MAN TO NEGLECT THE PRIVILEGES SUCH A REPUTATION CONFERRED
AND IF HE HAD BEEN TROUBLED ABOUT MONEY MATTERS NOTHING EVER DISTURBED THEIR IRREFLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MANY POSSESSIONS
WHILE I TALKED I NEVER SAW AN UGLY MAN LOOK SO HANDSOME HE'S VERY SIMPLE MINDED SAID ISABEL AND HE'S NOT SO UGLY THERE'S NOTHING SO SIMPLIFYING AS A GRAND PASSION
MIGHT WATCH A FREE GREYHOUND I WANT TO SEE HER SAFELY MARRIED THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE SHE FREQUENTLY NOTED TO HER HUSBAND WELL I MUST SAY I SHOULD HAVE NO PARTICULAR DESIRE TO MARRY HER
YOU CAN'T IMPROVE YOUR MIND MISS ARCHER HER COMPANION DECLARED IT'S ALREADY A MOST FORMIDABLE INSTRUMENT IT LOOKS DOWN ON US ALL IT DESPISES US DESPISES YOU YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME
IT TOOK PERPETUALLY FOR GRANTED A THOUSAND GOOD INTENTIONS SHE LOST HERSELF IN A MAZE OF VISIONS THE FINE THINGS TO BE DONE BY A RICH INDEPENDENT GENEROUS GIRL WHO TOOK A LARGE HUMAN VIEW OF OCCASIONS AND OBLIGATIONS
AS REGARDS THAT SAID ISABEL I SHOULD FIND IN MY OWN NATION ENTERTAINMENT FOR A LIFETIME BUT WE'VE A LONG DRIVE AND MY AUNT WILL SOON WISH TO START SHE TURNED BACK
MISS ARCHER THESE WORDS WERE UTTERED WITH AN INDEFINABLE SOUND WHICH STARTLED THE GIRL
SHE WAS LEARNING TO SACRIFICE CONSISTENCY TO CONSIDERATIONS OF THAT INFERIOR ORDER FOR WHICH THE EXCUSE MUST BE FOUND IN THE PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS NOT TO THE CREDIT OF HER ABSOLUTE RECTITUDE
NO I'M NOT EASILY CHARMED AND THEN HE STOPPED A MOMENT
THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN GRAVELY ILL IN THE SPRING AND THE DOCTORS HAD WHISPERED TO RALPH THAT ANOTHER ATTACK WOULD BE LESS EASY TO DEAL WITH JUST NOW HE APPEARED DISBURDENED OF PAIN BUT RALPH COULD NOT RID HIMSELF OF A SUSPICION THAT THIS WAS A SUBTERFUGE OF THE ENEMY
WHATEVER HE DOES WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT ISABEL REPEATED WHEN A MAN'S OF THAT INFALLIBLE MOULD WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO HIM WHAT ONE FEELS IT MAY NOT MATTER TO HIM BUT IT MATTERS TO ONE'S SELF AH
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I SHOULD WAIT FOR YOU MISSUS TOUCHETT ANSWERED
THE PLACE ITSELF WAS SOVEREIGN HER UNCLE WAS MORE AND MORE A SORT OF GOLDEN GRANDFATHER AND RALPH WAS UNLIKE ANY COUSIN SHE HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED HER IDEA OF COUSINS HAVING TENDED TO GLOOM THEN
SHE WAS IN THE MOOD FOR LIKING EVERYTHING
A CANDID NATURAL COUNTENANCE A CAPACIOUS APPETITE AND A TENDENCY TO INDISCRIMINATE LAUGHTER
POOR RALPH HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS STEEPED IN MELANCHOLY HIS OUTLOOK HABITUALLY SOMBRE LAY UNDER THE SHADOW OF A DEEPER CLOUD
IT'S THOUGHT A VERY GOOD POSITION SAID THE YOUNGER SISTER IT'S THE FIRST POSITION IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTY I DARE SAY YOU THINK ME VERY IRREVERENT ISABEL TOOK OCCASION TO REMARK
HAD LAID BEFORE HER A PAIR OF ALTERNATIVES NOW OF COURSE YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOUR OWN MISTRESS AND ARE AS FREE AS THE BIRD ON THE BOUGH I DON'T MEAN YOU WERE NOT SO BEFORE BUT YOU'RE AT PRESENT ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING
IT IS ONLY BECAUSE IT HOLDS YOU I HAVE BEEN TO ENGLAND BEFORE BUT HAVE NEVER ENJOYED IT MUCH MAY I NOT COME AND SEE YOU FOR HALF AN HOUR THIS AT PRESENT IS THE DEAREST WISH OF YOURS FAITHFULLY
ISABEL RETURNED DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A FALSE POSITION HER COMPANIONS EVIDENTLY HAD LOST THEMSELVES MY BROTHER'S POSITION MISS MOLYNEUX ENQUIRED
SHE COULD SUMMON BACK HER FAITH IN CASE OF NEED WITH AN EFFORT BUT THE EFFORT WAS OFTEN PAINFUL EVEN WHEN THE REALITY HAD BEEN PLEASANT THE PAST WAS APT TO LOOK DEAD AND ITS REVIVAL RATHER TO SHOW THE
AND HAD MASTERED THE SOVEREIGN TRUTH THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS GOT FOR NOTHING SHE HAD PLAYED NO SOCIAL PART AS MISTRESS OF GARDENCOURT AND IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY A MINUTE ACCOUNT SHOULD BE KEPT OF HER COMINGS AND GOINGS
I'M NOT SO IN THE LEAST I PROTEST
A REMARKABLY HANDSOME HEAD AND A VERY TAKING MANNER INDEED AS ONE OF THEM HAD SAID HE WAS ALWAYS TAKING SOMETHING THEY HAD DECLARED THAT HE WAS MAKING A VERY POOR USE OF HIS LIFE HE HAD SQUANDERED A SUBSTANTIAL FORTUNE
IN A SHORT TIME THE CHIEF'S VOICE WAS HEARD ON THE STAIR IN A TONE OF IMPATIENT FURY CALLUM WHY CALLUM BEG DIAOUL HE ENTERED THE ROOM WITH ALL THE MARKS OF A MAN AGITATED BY A TOWERING PASSION
THE QUESTION INDEED OCCURRED WHITHER HE WAS TO DIRECT HIS COURSE WHEN AGAIN AT HIS OWN DISPOSAL TWO SCHEMES SEEMED PRACTICABLE YET BOTH ATTENDED WITH DANGER AND DIFFICULTY ONE WAS TO GO BACK TO GLENNAQUOICH AND JOIN FERGUS MAC IVOR
THIS DOUGHTY GENERAL'S NERVES BEING BRACED BY THE KEEN AIR OF ABERDEEN HE HAS TAKEN SHIPPING FOR DUNBAR AND I HAVE JUST RECEIVED CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT HE LANDED THERE YESTERDAY
IS ABSOLUTELY UNCERTAIN HIS MATTER WAS COPIOUS HIS VOICE POWERFUL AND HIS MEMORY STRONG SO THAT THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE OF HIS ENDING HIS EXHORTATION TILL THE PARTY HAD REACHED STIRLING
DEAR FERGUS SAID WAVERLEY EAGERLY RETURNING HIS GREETING IT IS LONG SINCE I HAVE HEARD A FRIEND'S VOICE WHERE IS FLORA SAFE AND A TRIUMPHANT SPECTATOR OF OUR SUCCESS IN THIS PLACE SAID WAVERLEY AY
UPON THE SIXTH DAY OF HIS CONFINEMENT WAVERLEY FOUND HIMSELF SO WELL THAT HE BEGAN TO MEDITATE HIS ESCAPE FROM THIS DULL AND MISERABLE PRISON HOUSE THINKING ANY RISK WHICH HE MIGHT INCUR IN THE ATTEMPT PREFERABLE TO THE STUPEFYING AND INTOLERABLE UNIFORMITY OF JANET'S RETIREMENT
WITH HER PATERNAL ESTATE TACKED TO THE FRINGE OF HER ERMINE BUT BEFORE ENTERING UPON A SUBJECT OF PROVERBIAL DELAY I MUST REMIND MY READER OF THE PROGRESS OF A STONE ROLLED DOWNHILL BY AN IDLE TRUANT BOY
NOR SO FAR AS HE COULD OBSERVE DID SHE AGAIN REVISIT THE COTTAGE ALL PRECAUTIONS TO BLOCKADE HIS VIEW WERE FROM THAT TIME ABANDONED AND HE WAS NOT ONLY PERMITTED BUT ASSISTED TO RISE
AY YE ARE DECEIVED WITH HER ENCHANTMENTS
WHO COULD HOWEVER DISTINGUISH A FEW DROPPING SHOTS FIRED ABOUT THE SPOT WHICH HE HAD LEFT THIS AS HE AFTERWARDS LEARNED PROCEEDED FROM GILFILLAN'S PARTY WHO HAD NOW ASSEMBLED THE STRAGGLERS IN FRONT AND REAR HAVING JOINED THE OTHERS
AND FRANK STANLEY ACTED AS BRIDESMAN HAVING JOINED EDWARD WITH THAT VIEW SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL LADY EMILY AND COLONEL TALBOT HAD PROPOSED BEING PRESENT BUT LADY EMILY'S HEALTH WHEN THE DAY APPROACHED WAS FOUND INADEQUATE TO THE JOURNEY
AND OPPOSED HIS EXIT ACCOMPANYING HIS ACTION WITH SIGNS WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY THERE WAS DANGER IN THE ATTEMPT AND AN ENEMY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
NOR WAS THE FACE VISIBLE AND TO CROWN HIS VEXATION WHILE HE LABOURED WITH THE NAIL TO ENLARGE THE HOLE THAT HE MIGHT OBTAIN A MORE COMPLETE VIEW A SLIGHT NOISE BETRAYED HIS PURPOSE AND THE OBJECT OF HIS CURIOSITY INSTANTLY DISAPPEARED
DISTRICT OF MOIDART WITH ONLY SEVEN ATTENDANTS AND OF THE NUMEROUS CHIEFS AND CLANS WHOSE LOYAL ENTHUSIASM AT ONCE PLACED A SOLITARY ADVENTURER AT THE HEAD OF A GALLANT ARMY YOU MUST ALSO I THINK HAVE LEARNED THAT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE HANOVERIAN ELECTOR
THE OPPOSITE OPINION MAINTAINS THAT A RETROGRADE MOVEMENT IN OUR CIRCUMSTANCES IS CERTAIN TO THROW UTTER DISCREDIT ON OUR ARMS AND UNDERTAKING AND FAR FROM GAINING US NEW PARTIZANS WILL BE THE MEANS OF DISHEARTENING THOSE WHO HAVE JOINED OUR STANDARD
AND EMPLOYMENTS AND INHERITANCES OF THIS WICKED WORLD I COULD PROVE TO YOU BY THE SCRIPTURE
AT THEIR APPROACH THE HIGHLANDERS DREW OFF BUT NOT BEFORE THEY HAD RIFLED GILFILLAN AND TWO OF HIS PEOPLE WHO REMAINED ON THE SPOT GRIEVOUSLY WOUNDED A FEW SHOTS WERE EXCHANGED BETWIXT THEM AND THE WESTLANDERS
THE OFFICERS WHO USE THESE LAST ARGUMENTS AMONG WHOM IS YOUR FRIEND FERGUS MAC IVOR MAINTAIN THAT IF THE HIGHLANDERS ARE STRANGERS TO THE USUAL MILITARY DISCIPLINE OF EUROPE THE SOLDIERS WHOM THEY ARE TO ENCOUNTER ARE NO LESS STRANGERS TO THEIR PECULIAR AND FORMIDABLE MODE OF ATTACK
AT ALL FITTING PAUSES OF HIS HOMILY AND WHAT MAY YE BE FRIEND SAID THE GIFTED GILFILLAN
AS I THINK IT NECESSARY TO HAVE FOR THE FUTURE MISTRESS OF MY FAMILY AND THE MOTHER OF MY CHILDREN SHE IS A VERY PRETTY INTELLIGENT GIRL AND IS CERTAINLY OF ONE OF THE VERY FIRST LOWLAND FAMILIES AND WITH A LITTLE OF FLORA'S INSTRUCTIONS AND FORMING
FOR I HOLD THAT THE CHIEF OF SUCH A CLAN AS THE SLIOCHD NAN IVOR IS SUPERIOR IN RANK TO ANY EARL IN SCOTLAND BUT I HAD A PARTICULAR REASON FOR ASSUMING THIS CURSED TITLE AT THIS TIME
THAT HE WAS FORTHWITH LEVELLED TO THE GROUND IN THE CONFUSION WHICH ENSUED THE HORSE WHICH BORE OUR HERO WAS SHOT BY ONE OF GILFILLAN'S PARTY AS HE DISCHARGED HIS FIRELOCK AT RANDOM WAVERLEY FELL WITH AND INDEED UNDER THE ANIMAL
WAVERLEY WAS COMPELLED TO CONCLUDE THAT HIS CONJECTURE WAS ALTOGETHER IMPROBABLE SINCE TO SUPPOSE SHE HAD LEFT HER COMPARATIVELY SAFE SITUATION AT GLENNAQUOICH TO DESCEND INTO THE LOW COUNTRY NOW THE SEAT OF CIVIL WAR
NOT TO MENTION THAT SOMETIMES HIS BED HAD NOT BEEN ARRANGED FOR TWO DAYS TOGETHER WAVERLEY'S MIND INVOLUNTARILY TURNED TO THE PATMOS OF THE BARON OF BRADWARDINE WHO WAS WELL PLEASED WITH JANET'S FARE AND A FEW BUNCHES OF STRAW STOWED IN A CLEFT IN THE FRONT OF A SAND CLIFF
AND THERE WERE FEW UPON WHOSE FEATURES RAGE PRODUCED A MORE VIOLENT EFFECT THE VEINS OF HIS FOREHEAD SWELLED WHEN HE WAS IN SUCH AGITATION HIS NOSTRIL BECAME DILATED HIS CHEEK AND EYE INFLAMED AND HISLOOK THAT OF A DEMONIAC
AND EXALTED IMAGINATION FORMS A PECULIAR SPECIES OF COURAGE WHICH SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES THE LIGHT USUALLY CARRIED BY A MINER SUFFICIENTLY COMPETENT INDEED TO AFFORD HIM GUIDANCE AND COMFORT DURING THE ORDINARY PERILS OF HIS LABOUR BUT CERTAIN TO BE EXTINGUISHED SHOULD HE ENCOUNTER
AFTER A FEW WORDS OF GAELIC FROM WHICH WAVERLEY GATHERED THAT HE EXHORTED HIM TO REPOSE SO BEHOLD OUR HERO FOR A SECOND TIME THE PATIENT OF A HIGHLAND ESCULAPIUS BUT IN A SITUATION MUCH MORE UNCOMFORTABLE THAN WHEN HE WAS THE GUEST OF THE WORTHY TOMANRAIT
WHEN BEHOLD THE PEDLAR SNATCHING A MUSKET FROM THE PERSON WHO WAS NEXT HIM BESTOWED THE BUTT OF IT WITH SUCH EMPHASIS ON THE HEAD OF HIS LATE INSTRUCTOR
WAVERLEY WAS THEN MOUNTED UPON ONE OF THE HORSES A CHANGE WHICH THE FATIGUE OF THE NIGHT AND HIS RECENT ILLNESS RENDERED EXCEEDINGLY ACCEPTABLE HIS PORTMANTEAU WAS PLACED ON ANOTHER PONY DUNCAN MOUNTED A THIRD AND THEY SET FORWARD AT A ROUND PACE ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR ESCORT
THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEEMS WELL RECONCILED TO AND WHAT BECOMES OF THE HOMAGE CURSE THE HOMAGE I BELIEVE ROSE IS TO PULL OFF THE QUEEN'S SLIPPER ON HER CORONATION DAY OR SOME SUCH TRASH
RESOLVING THAT HE SHOULD BE A HEARER AT LEAST IF NOT A DISPUTANT PROCEEDED IN HIS JEREMIADE
AND INDEMNITIES AND OATHS AND BONDS AND OTHER CORRUPTIONS
HOW MUCH LONGER THIS MILITARY THEOLOGIST MIGHT HAVE CONTINUED HIS INVECTIVE
THE BELT OF WHICH WAS PLAITED WITH SILVER AND THE STEEL BASKET HILT RICHLY AND CURIOUSLY INLAID THE BLADE SAID THE PRINCE IS A GENUINE ANDREA FERRARA IT HAS BEEN A SORT OF HEIR LOOM IN OUR FAMILY BUT I AM CONVINCED I PUT IT INTO BETTER HANDS THAN MY OWN
WHEN THIS OFFICER LEFT THE ROOM THE CHIEFTAIN GRADUALLY REASSUMED SOME DEGREE OF COMPOSURE I KNOW WAVERLEY HE SAID THAT COLONEL TALBOT HAS PERSUADED YOU TO CURSE TEN TIMES A DAY YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH US NAY NEVER DENY IT
THAT THE ATTACHMENT AND COURAGE OF THE CHIEFS AND GENTLEMEN ARE NOT TO BE DOUBTED AND THAT AS THEY WILL BE IN THE MIDST OF THE ENEMY THEIR CLANSMEN WILL AS SURELY FOLLOW THEM IN FINE THAT HAVING DRAWN THE SWORD WE SHOULD THROW AWAY THE SCABBARD AND TRUST OUR CAUSE TO BATTLE AND TO THE GOD OF BATTLES
BY THE HONOUR OF DONALD STEWART GOVERNOR OF THE GARRISON AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL IN THE SERVICE OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE CHARLES EDWARD SO SAYING HE HASTILY LEFT THE APARTMENT AS IF TO AVOID FURTHER DISCUSSION
THAT NOBODY DARE LAUGH AT HIM SO HIS ABSURDITY GOES FOR NOTHING I TELL YOU THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NO EARTHLY OBJECTION NONE I HAD SETTLED THE THING ENTIRELY IN MY OWN MIND BUT HAD YOU ASKED THE BARON'S CONSENT SAID WAVERLEY OR ROSE'S
THE HIGHLANDER AFTER GIVING THEM A FULL VIEW OF HIS PERSON DIVED AMONG THE THICKETS FOR HIS RUSE DE GUERRE HAD NOW PERFECTLY SUCCEEDED WHILE THE SOLDIERS PURSUED THE CAUSE OF THEIR DISTURBANCE IN ONE DIRECTION WAVERLEY ADOPTING THE HINT OF HIS REMAINING ATTENDANT
BUT HIS PRIDE FOUND SOME CONSOLATION IN REFLECTING THAT HE AND HIS SON IN LAW HAVING BEEN SO LATELY IN ARMS AGAINST GOVERNMENT IT MIGHT GIVE MATTER OF REASONABLE FEAR AND OFFENCE TO THE RULING POWERS
AS THOSE WHO WERE JUST ARRIVED SNATCHED A HASTY MEAL AND THE OTHERS ASSUMED THEIR ARMS AND MADE BRIEF PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR DEPARTURE AS HE SAT IN THE SMOKY HUT AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE FIRE AROUND WHICH THE OTHERS WERE CROWDED HE FELT A GENTLE PRESSURE UPON HIS ARM
SO THAT HE FAIRLY GAVE US THE SLIP AND MARCHED NORTHWARD TO ABERDEEN LEAVING THE LOW COUNTRY OPEN AND UNDEFENDED NOT TO LOSE SO FAVOURABLE AN OPPORTUNITY I MARCHED ON TO THIS METROPOLIS DRIVING BEFORE ME TWO REGIMENTS OF HORSE
AND IT WAS ONLY AS SHE TRIPT OUT FROM THE DOOR THAT FAVOURED BY THE OBSCURITY SHE GAVE WAVERLEY A PARTING SMILE AND NOD OF SIGNIFICANCE ERE SHE VANISHED IN THE DARK GLEN THE YOUNG HIGHLANDER WAS REPEATEDLY
FOR THIS OPINION HE GAVE MOST LEARNED AND SATISFACTORY REASONS THAT THE READER MAY NOT CARE TO HEAR REPEATED HAVING ESCAPED FROM THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAVERLEY WENT TO FERGUS'S LODGINGS BY APPOINTMENT TO AWAIT HIS RETURN FROM HOLYROOD HOUSE
HAD OCCASIONED HIM SOME PERSONAL INCONVENIENCE AS UPON THE BARONET'S BEING ARRESTED BY A KING'S MESSENGER HE HAD DEEMED IT PRUDENT TO RETIRE TO A CONCEALMENT CALLED THE PRIEST'S HOLE FROM THE USE IT HAD BEEN PUT TO IN FORMER DAYS WHERE HE ASSURED OUR HERO
IT ASSORTED TOO WELL WITH THE PRINCIPLES IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO INCUR REPROBATION OR EVEN CENSURE COLONEL TALBOT ALSO HAD SMOOTHED THE WAY WITH GREAT ADDRESS FOR EDWARD'S FAVOURABLE RECEPTION BY DWELLING UPON HIS GALLANT BEHAVIOUR IN THE MILITARY CHARACTER
AND I ASKED YOU TO MEET ME HERE THINKING LIKE A FOOL THAT I SHOULD WANT YOUR COUNTENANCE AS BRIDE'S MAN WELL I STATE MY PRETENSION THEY ARE NOT DENIED THE PROMISES SO REPEATEDLY MADE AND THE PATENT GRANTED THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGED
BUT SINCE THE DAYS OF OUR GRANDMOTHER EVE THE GRATIFICATION OF INORDINATE CURIOSITY
IN THE MEANWHILE I HOPE FOR YOUR PERMISSION TO SERVE AS A VOLUNTEER UNDER MY FRIEND FERGUS MAC IVOR AT LEAST SAID THE PRINCE WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY PLEASED WITH THIS PROPOSAL ALLOW ME THE PLEASURE OF ARMING YOU AFTER THE HIGHLAND FASHION WITH THESE WORDS HE UNBUCKLED THE BROADSWORD WHICH HE WORE
WHY WHAT SIGNIFIES WHAT THEY WERE MAN I TELL YOU IT WAS I THAT MADE THEM I TO WHOM HE OWES MORE THAN TO ANY THREE WHO HAVE JOINED THE STANDARD FOR I NEGOTIATED THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND BROUGHT IN ALL THE PERTHSHIRE MEN WHEN NOT ONE WOULD HAVE STIRRED
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT A PARTY OF SOLDIERS WERE NEAR AND UPON THEIR GUARD THOUGH NOT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO DETECT MEN SKILFUL IN EVERY ART OF PREDATORY WARFARE LIKE THOSE WITH WHOM HE NOW WATCHED THEIR INEFFECTUAL PRECAUTIONS WHEN THESE SOUNDS HAD DIED UPON THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT
ANSWERED GILFILLAN CONTEMPTUOUSLY A WRETCHED ERASTIAN
ONE THAT BEING INFERIOR PROBABLY IN NUMBERS AND CERTAINLY IN DISCIPLINE AND MILITARY APPOINTMENTS NOT TO MENTION OUR TOTAL WANT OF ARTILLERY AND THE WEAKNESS OF OUR CAVALRY IT WILL BE SAFEST TO FALL BACK TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS AND THERE PROTRACT THE WAR UNTIL FRESH SUCCOURS ARRIVE FROM FRANCE
BUT I PROPOSE AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE TO ASSUME THE RANK WHICH THE PATENT BESTOWED I HAVE THE OLD STORY OF THE JEALOUSY OF C AND M TRUMPED UP AGAINST ME I RESIST THIS PRETEXT AND OFFER TO PROCURE THEIR WRITTEN ACQUIESCENCE
BUT HIS FORTUNE HAD SETTLED THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE LEFT TO HIS OPTION
THAT THEY SHOULD WEAR THE TARTAN STRIPED IN THE MODE PECULIAR TO THEIR RACE A MARK OF DISTINCTION ANCIENTLY GENERAL THROUGH THE HIGHLANDS AND STILL MAINTAINED BY THOSE CHIEFS WHO WERE PROUD OF THEIR LINEAGE OR JEALOUS OF THEIR SEPARATE AND EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY
THE PRINCE FOR ALTHOUGH UNFORTUNATE IN THE FAULTS AND FOLLIES OF HIS FOREFATHERS
AFTER PROCEEDING A GREATER WAY IN THIS INCONVENIENT MANNER THAN WAS AT ALL COMFORTABLE TO HIS KNEES AND SHINS WAVERLEY PERCEIVED THE SMELL OF SMOKE WHICH PROBABLY HAD BEEN MUCH SOONER DISTINGUISHED BY THE MORE ACUTE NASAL ORGANS OF HIS GUIDE
TO COME OUT AGREEABLE TO HIS PROMISE TWENTY TIMES PLEDGED UNDER A PRETENDED JEALOUSY OF THE PRINCE'S PARTIALITY TO ME AND TO LEAVE THIS MISERABLE DRIVELLER WITHOUT A PRETENCE FOR HIS COWARDICE THE PRINCE ASKS IT AS A PERSONAL FAVOUR OF ME FORSOOTH
WHO HAS BEEN FREQUENT IN HIS INQUIRIES AFTER YOU THUS SAYING HE DRAGGED WAVERLEY BY THE ARM OUT OF THE GUARD CHAMBER AND ERE HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS CONDUCTED EDWARD FOUND HIMSELF IN A PRESENCE ROOM FITTED UP WITH SOME ATTEMPT AT ROYAL STATE
WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF ACTING AS ONE OF MY AIDES DE CAMP UNTIL YOU CAN BE ATTACHED TO A REGIMENT OF WHICH I HOPE SEVERAL WILL BE SPEEDILY EMBODIED YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL FORGIVE ME ANSWERED WAVERLEY
OF SOFTNESS AND DELICACY HOLD DIALOGUE WITH THE HOARSE INWARD CROAK OF OLD JANET FOR SO HE UNDERSTOOD HIS ANTIQUATED ATTENDANT WAS DENOMINATED HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO AMUSE HIS SOLITUDE
AND THE THATCH OF BRANCHES OF TREES THE FIRE WAS IN THE CENTRE AND FILLED THE WHOLE WIGWAM WITH SMOKE WHICH ESCAPED AS MUCH THROUGH THE DOOR AS BY MEANS OF A CIRCULAR APERTURE IN THE ROOF AN OLD HIGHLAND SIBYL THE ONLY INHABITANT OF THIS FORLORN MANSION
BUT THE LATTER NOW WITHOUT A COMMANDER AND APPREHENSIVE OF A SECOND AMBUSH DID NOT MAKE ANY SERIOUS EFFORT TO RECOVER THEIR PRISONER
AND THEY NOW CARRIED ON BUSINESS AS MESSRS CLIPPURSE AND HOOKEM THESE WORTHY GENTLEMEN HAD DIRECTIONS TO MAKE THE NECESSARY SETTLEMENTS ON THE MOST SPLENDID SCALE OF LIBERALITY AS IF EDWARD WERE TO WED A PEERESS IN HER OWN RIGHT
SWEEPING BEFORE THEM EVERY CONSIDERATION OF AN OPPOSITE TENDENCY THE TIME BESIDES ADMITTED OF NO DELIBERATION AND WAVERLEY KNEELING TO CHARLES EDWARD
RANKED THE EXPLOITS OF EDWARD WITH THOSE OF WILIBERT HILDEBRAND AND NIGEL THE VAUNTED HEROES OF THEIR LINE THE APPEARANCE OF WAVERLEY EMBROWNED BY EXERCISE AND DIGNIFIED BY THE HABITS OF MILITARY DISCIPLINE
AND SUSTAINED SOME SEVERE CONTUSIONS BUT HE WAS ALMOST INSTANTLY EXTRICATED FROM THE FALLEN STEED BY TWO HIGHLANDERS WHO EACH SEIZING HIM BY THE ARM HURRIED HIM AWAY FROM THE SCUFFLE AND FROM THE HIGHROAD
AND WHICH OF COURSE WOULD SUPERSEDE THAT DIFFICULTY
AND TWO HIGHLANDERS ENTERED WHOM WAVERLEY RECOGNISED AS HAVING BEEN A PART OF HIS ORIGINAL ESCORT TO THIS COTTAGE THEY CONVERSED FOR A SHORT TIME WITH THE OLD MAN AND HIS COMPANION AND THEN MADE WAVERLEY UNDERSTAND BY VERY SIGNIFICANT SIGNS THAT HE WAS TO PREPARE TO ACCOMPANY THEM
BUT AS WE BEFORE HINTED HE ALSO EXULTED AS A POLITICIAN IN BEHOLDING SECURED TO HIS PARTY A PARTIZAN OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE AND HE WAS FAR FROM BEING INSENSIBLE TO THE PERSONAL IMPORTANCE WHICH HE HIMSELF GAINED WITH THE PRINCE FROM HAVING SO MATERIALLY
WE ARE THEREFORE SO FAR FROM ATTEMPTING TO TRACE THE DULL PROGRESS OF MESSRS CLIPPURSE AND HOOKEM OR THAT OF THEIR WORTHY OFFICIAL BRETHREN WHO HAD THE CHARGE OF SUING OUT THE PARDONS OF EDWARD WAVERLEY AND HIS INTENDED FATHER IN LAW
FOR I AM AT THIS MOMENT TEMPTED TO CURSE MY OWN WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT I MADE THIS VERY MORNING TWO SUITS TO THE PRINCE AND HE HAS REJECTED THEM BOTH WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT WHAT CAN I THINK ANSWERED WAVERLEY TILL I KNOW WHAT YOUR REQUESTS WERE
I COULD HAVE NO OBJECTION BUT FERGUS SAID WAVERLEY I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU HAD ANY AFFECTION FOR MISS BRADWARDINE AND YOU ARE ALWAYS SNEERING AT HER FATHER I HAVE AS MUCH AFFECTION FOR MISS BRADWARDINE MY GOOD FRIEND
AND THENCE TO TAKE SHIPPING FOR ENGLAND HIS MIND WAVERED BETWEEN THESE PLANS AND PROBABLY IF HE HAD EFFECTED HIS ESCAPE IN THE MANNER HE PROPOSED
HE MIGHT BE ABLE BY BECOMING A BORROWER OF THE NIGHT FOR AN HOUR OR TWO TO REACH IT THAT EVENING HE THEREFORE PUT FORTH HIS STRENGTH AND MARCHED STOUTLY ALONG AT THE HEAD OF HIS FOLLOWERS
SET FORTH BY THE FRIENDS OF THE ELECTOR OF HANOVER IN WHICH THEY RANK MISTER WAVERLEY AMONG THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY WHO ARE MENACED WITH THE PAINS OF HIGH TREASON FOR LOYALTY TO THEIR LEGITIMATE SOVEREIGN BUT I DESIRE TO GAIN NO ADHERENTS SAVE FROM AFFECTION AND CONVICTION
YE'VE BEEN FED IN SICCAN A FAULD BELIKE NO I AM OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND SAID WAVERLEY
GILFILLAN BUT NEITHER DID THIS PRODUCE ANY MARK OF RECOGNITION FROM HIS ESCORT THE TWILIGHT HAD GIVEN PLACE TO MOONSHINE WHEN THE PARTY HALTED UPON THE BRINK OF A PRECIPITOUS GLEN WHICH AS PARTLY ENLIGHTENED BY THE MOONBEAMS
CHARLES EDWARD ON HIS PART SEEMED EAGER TO SHOW HIS ATTENDANTS THE VALUE WHICH HE ATTACHED TO HIS NEW ADHERENT BY ENTERING IMMEDIATELY AS IN CONFIDENCE UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS SITUATION YOU HAVE BEEN SECLUDED SO MUCH FROM INTELLIGENCE MISTER WAVERLEY
RECOVERED BY THE SWORD WHICH HE WAS ALREADY BENDING TOWARDS OTHER CONQUESTS GAVE EDWARD IN HIS OWN EYES THE DIGNITY AND IMPORTANCE WHICH HE HAD CEASED TO CONSIDER AS HIS ATTRIBUTES REJECTED SLANDERED AND THREATENED UPON THE ONE SIDE
AH YOUR HONOUR HAS A NOTABLE FACULTY IN SEARCHING AND EXPLAINING THE SECRET
FERGUS GAVE A BROAD STARE AT THE COMPARISON WHICH THIS SUPPOSITION IMPLIED BUT CAUTIOUSLY SUPPRESSED THE ANSWER WHICH ROSE TO HIS TONGUE O WE SHOULD EASILY HAVE ARRANGED ALL THAT SO SIR I CRAVED A PRIVATE INTERVIEW AND THIS MORNING WAS ASSIGNED
HAD NOT HIS ATTENTION BEEN ATTRACTED BY A PEDLAR WHO HAD JOINED THE MARCH FROM A CROSS ROAD
FOR SERVICES THEN RENDERED AND CERTAINLY MY MERIT HAS NOT BEEN DIMINISHED TO SAY THE LEAST BY MY SUBSEQUENT BEHAVIOUR NOW SIR I VALUE THIS BAUBLE OF A CORONET AS LITTLE AS YOU CAN OR ANY PHILOSOPHER ON EARTH
EDWARD HAD REACHED HIS NATIVE COUNTRY BEFORE HE COULD AS USUAL ON FORMER OCCASIONS LOOK ROUND FOR ENJOYMENT UPON THE FACE OF NATURE HE THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE LEAVING EDINBURGH BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE THAT PLEASURE
HEAVILY CONSTRUCTED OF OAK AND STUDDED THICKLY WITH IRON NAILS BEING NEXT OPENED ADMITTED THEM INTO THE INTERIOR COURT YARD A GENTLEMAN DRESSED IN THE HIGHLAND GARB AND HAVING A WHITE COCKADE IN HIS BONNET ASSISTED WAVERLEY TO DISMOUNT FROM HIS HORSE
HE LOOKED ROUND IT WAS ALICE THE DAUGHTER OF DONALD BEAN LEAN SHE SHOWED HIM A PACKET OF PAPERS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE MOTION WAS REMARKED BY NO ONE ELSE
AND PASSED ON AS IF TO ASSIST OLD JANET IN PACKING WAVERLEY'S CLOTHES IN HIS PORTMANTEAU IT WAS OBVIOUSLY HER WISH THAT HE SHOULD NOT SEEM TO RECOGNISE HER YET SHE REPEATEDLY LOOKED BACK AT HIM AS AN OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED OF DOING SO UNOBSERVED
WHEN IT GAVE WAY TO THE CARE OF HIS ATTENDANTS AND THE STRENGTH OF HIS CONSTITUTION AND HE COULD NOW RAISE HIMSELF IN HIS BED THOUGH NOT WITHOUT PAIN HE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DISINCLINATION ON THE PART OF THE OLD WOMAN WHO ACTED AS HIS NURSE
WAVERLEY TURNED AND WAS WARMLY EMBRACED BY FERGUS MAC IVOR A THOUSAND WELCOMES TO HOLYROOD ONCE MORE POSSESSED BY HER LEGITIMATE SOVEREIGN DID I NOT SAY WE SHOULD PROSPER AND THAT YOU WOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE PHILISTINES IF YOU PARTED FROM US
WILL YOU NOT ADD TO YOUR CIVILITIES SAID WAVERLEY AFTER HAVING MADE THE USUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HAVING THE KINDNESS TO INFORM ME WHERE I AM AND WHETHER OR NOT I AM TO CONSIDER MYSELF AS A PRISONER
WHEN DUNCAN HIMSELF APPEARED OUT OF BREATH INDEED AND WITH ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF HAVING RUN FOR HIS LIFE BUT LAUGHING AND IN HIGH SPIRITS AT THE SUCCESS OF THE STRATAGEM BY WHICH HE HAD BAFFLED HIS PURSUERS THIS INDEED WAVERLEY COULD EASILY CONCEIVE MIGHT BE A MATTER OF
AND WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE REMARKED WHAT SHE DID SHE FOLDED THE PACKET WITH GREAT ADDRESS AND SPEED
WAVERLEY FOUND HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE GLOOMY YET PICTURESQUE STRUCTURE WHICH HE HAD ADMIRED AT A DISTANCE A HUGE IRON GRATED DOOR WHICH FORMED THE EXTERIOR DEFENCE OF THE GATEWAY WAS ALREADY THROWN BACK TO RECEIVE THEM AND A SECOND
AND EASILY OUTWEIGHED ALL PRUDENTIAL MOTIVES TO BE THUS PERSONALLY SOLICITED FOR ASSISTANCE BY A PRINCE WHOSE FORM AND MANNERS
HE EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN CONTRIVING SOME PLAN TO GRATIFY HIS CURIOSITY IN DESPITE OF THE SEDULOUS CAUTION OF JANET AND THE OLD HIGHLAND JANIZARY
LAYING HIS HAND ON THE SHOULDER OF THAT GALLANT AND ACCOMPLISHED CHIEFTAIN SAVED THEM THE TROUBLE OF FARTHER DELIBERATION BY ENTERING THE GATES WITH FIVE HUNDRED CAMERONS THUS FAR THEREFORE WE HAVE DONE WELL BUT IN THE MEANWHILE
AND ADVANCING BOLDLY UPON THE OPEN HEATH AS IF TO INVITE DISCOVERY HE LEVELLED HIS PIECE AND FIRED AT THE SENTINEL A WOUND IN THE ARM PROVED A DISAGREEABLE INTERRUPTION TO THE POOR FELLOW'S METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS TO THE TUNE OF NANCY DAWSON WHICH HE WAS WHISTLING
OR INDIAN FILE WAVERLEY BEING PLACED NEAREST TO THEIR LEADER HE MOVED WITH GREAT PRECAUTION AS IF TO AVOID GIVING ANY ALARM AND HALTED AS SOON AS HE CAME TO THE VERGE OF THE ASCENT WAVERLEY WAS SOON SENSIBLE OF THE REASON
BEING AS WAVERLEY WELL KNEW THE CONSTANT REPLY OF A HIGHLANDER
FROM CAUSES OF WHICH I AM BUT INDISTINCTLY INFORMED THAT I PRESUME YOU ARE EVEN YET UNACQUAINTED WITH THE IMPORTANT PARTICULARS OF MY PRESENT SITUATION
NO GREAT DIFFICULTY TO THE ACTIVE MOUNTAINEER WHO WAS PERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE GROUND AND TRACED HIS COURSE WITH A FIRMNESS AND CONFIDENCE TO WHICH HIS PURSUERS MUST HAVE BEEN STRANGERS THE ALARM WHICH HE EXCITED SEEMED STILL TO CONTINUE
I AM NOT LIKELY I THINK TO ASK ANYTHING VERY UNREASONABLE AND IF I DID THEY MIGHT HAVE STRETCHED A POINT WELL BUT YOU SHALL KNOW ALL NOW THAT I CAN DRAW MY BREATH AGAIN WITH SOME FREEDOM YOU REMEMBER MY EARL'S PATENT IT IS DATED SOME YEARS BACK
THE ONLY FURNITURE EXCEPTING A WASHING TUB AND A WOODEN PRESS CALLED IN SCOTLAND AN AMBRY SORELY DECAYED WAS A LARGE WOODEN BED PLANKED AS IS USUAL ALL AROUND AND OPENING BY A SLIDING PANEL
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT AMONG THESE NOBLES AND GENTLEMEN HE WILL FIND WORTHY ASSOCIATES IN A GALLANT ENTERPRISE AND WILL FOLLOW A MASTER WHO MAY BE UNFORTUNATE BUT I TRUST WILL NEVER BE UNGRATEFUL THE POLITIC CHIEFTAIN
OR TO JOIN THE FORCES OF THE ELECTOR HE SHALL HAVE MY PASSPORT AND FREE PERMISSION TO DO SO AND I CAN ONLY REGRET THAT MY PRESENT POWER WILL NOT EXTEND TO PROTECT HIM AGAINST THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A MEASURE BUT CONTINUED CHARLES EDWARD AFTER ANOTHER SHORT PAUSE
PARTICULARLY HIS BRAVERY AND GENEROSITY AT PRESTON UNTIL WARMED AT THE IDEA OF THEIR NEPHEW'S ENGAGING IN SINGLE COMBAT MAKING PRISONER AND SAVING FROM SLAUGHTER SO DISTINGUISHED AN OFFICER AS THE COLONEL HIMSELF THE IMAGINATION OF THE BARONET AND HIS SISTER
ALLOW ME INSTEAD OF THE CAPTAIN'S COMMISSION WHICH YOU HAVE LOST
AND PROBABLY EXTENDED TO THE VERGE OF THE GLEN WHERE WAVERLEY HAD BEEN SO LONG AN INHABITANT
IN AN ADJACENT HOLLOW THEY FOUND SEVERAL HIGHLANDERS WITH A HORSE OR TWO THEY HAD NOT JOINED THEM ABOVE A FEW MINUTES WHICH WAVERLEY'S ATTENDANT EMPLOYED IN ALL PROBABILITY IN COMMUNICATING THE CAUSE OF THEIR DELAY FOR THE WORDS DUNCAN DUROCH WERE OFTEN REPEATED
THAT HE COULD NOT VENTURE TO OFFER AN OPINION AS DERIVED FROM MILITARY SKILL BUT THAT THE COUNSEL WOULD BE FAR THE MOST ACCEPTABLE TO HIM WHICH SHOULD FIRST AFFORD HIM AN OPPORTUNITY
MISTER GILFILLAN THEN CONSIDERED THE LAWFULNESS OF A PRIVATE MAN'S STANDING FORTH AS THE AVENGER OF PUBLIC OPPRESSION
IF MISTER WAVERLEY SHOULD LIKE HIS ANCESTOR SIR NIGEL DETERMINE TO EMBRACE A CAUSE WHICH HAS LITTLE TO RECOMMEND IT BUT ITS JUSTICE AND FOLLOW A PRINCE WHO THROWS HIMSELF UPON THE AFFECTIONS OF HIS PEOPLE TO RECOVER THE THRONE OF HIS ANCESTORS OR PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT
AS IF HE LONGED TO ENTER INTO CONTROVERSY WITH HIM AT LENGTH UNABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION HE SLACKENED HIS PACE TILL HE WAS ALONGSIDE OF HIS PRISONER'S HORSE AND AFTER MARCHING A FEW STEPS IN SILENCE ABREAST OF HIM HE SUDDENLY ASKED
THEY TELL OWER A CLASH O TERROR AND A CLATTER O COMFORT IN THEIR SERMONS
THUS SAYING HE EXTENDED HIS HAND TO EDWARD WITH THE UTMOST COURTESY WHO COULD NOT HAD HE DESIRED IT HAVE AVOIDED RENDERING HIM THE HOMAGE WHICH SEEMED DUE TO HIS RANK AND WAS CERTAINLY THE RIGHT OF HIS BIRTH I AM SORRY TO UNDERSTAND MISTER WAVERLEY THAT
YOU MUST KNOW THAT I LEARNED ACCIDENTALLY THAT THE PRINCE HAS BEEN PRESSING THAT OLD FOOLISH BARON OF BRADWARDINE TO DISINHERIT HIS MALE HEIR OR NINETEENTH OR TWENTIETH COUSIN WHO HAS TAKEN A COMMAND IN THE ELECTOR OF HANOVER'S MILITIA
AND THE HIGHLANDER WHO ASSUMED THE COMMAND AND WHO IN WAVERLEY'S AWAKENED RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO BE THE SAME TALL FIGURE WHO HAD ACTED AS DONALD BEAN LEAN'S LIEUTENANT BY WHISPERS AND SIGNS IMPOSED THE STRICTEST SILENCE
IN VIRTUE OF THE DATE OF MY PATENT AS PRIOR TO THEIR SILLY CLAIMS I ASSURE YOU I WOULD HAVE HAD SUCH A CONSENT FROM THEM IF IT HAD BEEN AT THE POINT OF THE SWORD AND THEN OUT COMES THE REAL TRUTH AND HE DARES TO TELL ME TO MY FACE
FRIEND
JOINED TO THE DELAY OCCASIONED BY THE MODE OF TRAVELLING AT THAT PERIOD RENDERED IT CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN TWO MONTHS ERE WAVERLEY HAVING LEFT ENGLAND ALIGHTED ONCE MORE AT THE MANSION OF THE LAIRD OF DUCHRAN TO CLAIM THE HAND OF HIS PLIGHTED BRIDE
AND I AM EVEN AT THIS MOMENT UNCERTAIN WHETHER I CAN HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CONSIDERING MISTER WAVERLEY AS AMONG MINE HE THEN PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT BUT BEFORE EDWARD COULD ADJUST A SUITABLE REPLY OR EVEN ARRANGE HIS IDEAS AS TO ITS PURPORT THE PRINCE TOOK OUT A PAPER AND THEN PROCEEDED
NO OTHER INCIDENT MARKED THE COURSE OF THAT NIGHT'S JOURNEY AND AT THE DAWN OF MORNING THEY ATTAINED THE BANKS OF A RAPID RIVER THE COUNTRY AROUND WAS AT ONCE FERTILE AND ROMANTIC STEEP BANKS OF WOOD WERE BROKEN BY CORN FIELDS
DESPATCHED BY HIS COMRADES AS IF TO COLLECT INTELLIGENCE AT LENGTH WHEN HE HAD RETURNED FOR THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THE WHOLE PARTY AROSE AND MADE SIGNS TO OUR HERO TO ACCOMPANY THEM BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE HOWEVER HE SHOOK HANDS WITH OLD JANET
HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED TO THE CAUSE WHICH THE PREJUDICES OF EDUCATION AND THE POLITICAL PRINCIPLES OF HIS FAMILY HAD ALREADY RECOMMENDED AS THE MOST JUST THESE THOUGHTS RUSHED THROUGH HIS MIND LIKE A TORRENT
SIR JOHN COPE MARCHED INTO THE HIGHLANDS AT THE HEAD OF A NUMEROUS AND WELL APPOINTED MILITARY FORCE WITH THE INTENTION OF GIVING US BATTLE BUT THAT HIS COURAGE FAILED HIM WHEN WE WERE WITHIN THREE HOURS MARCH OF EACH OTHER
OBEYED VERY COOLLY EVAN DHU UPON WHOSE BROW THE SUSPICION THAT HIS CHIEF HAD BEEN INSULTED CALLED UP A CORRESPONDING STORM SWELLED IN SULLEN SILENCE AWAITING TO LEARN WHERE OR UPON WHOM VENGEANCE WAS TO DESCEND
CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT A NOCTURNAL ADVENTURE
AND WILL ADD TO IT PISTOLS OF THE SAME WORKMANSHIP COLONEL MAC IVOR YOU MUST HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO YOUR FRIEND I WILL DETAIN YOU NO LONGER FROM YOUR PRIVATE CONVERSATION
AN INCIDENT OCCURRED WHICH INTERRUPTED HIS HARANGUE
BUT IT WAS PLAIN FROM ALICE'S MANNER THAT SHE DESIRED HE SHOULD CONSULT IT IN SECRET NOR DID SHE AGAIN SEEK HIS EYE AFTER SHE HAD SATISFIED HERSELF THAT HER MANOEUVRE WAS OBSERVED AND UNDERSTOOD
AS MY VIEWS IN LIFE MADE WHAT AT ANY OTHER TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN A MERE TRIFLE AT THIS CRISIS A SEVERE SACRIFICE AND THEN I EXPLAINED TO HIM MY FULL PLAN AND WHAT DID THE PRINCE ANSWER
AND ADDED SUBSTANTIAL MARKS OF HIS GRATITUDE FOR HER ATTENDANCE
HE REALLY LOVED WAVERLEY BECAUSE THEIR FEELINGS AND PROJECTS NEVER THWARTED EACH OTHER HE HOPED TO SEE HIM UNITED WITH FLORA
THIS WAS A JOYFUL COMMUNICATION WHAT HAD ALREADY PASSED DURING HIS CONFINEMENT MADE IT EVIDENT THAT NO PERSONAL INJURY WAS DESIGNED TO HIM AND HIS ROMANTIC SPIRIT HAVING RECOVERED DURING HIS REPOSE MUCH OF THAT ELASTICITY WHICH ANXIETY RESENTMENT DISAPPOINTMENT
AND TO SETTLE HIS ESTATE UPON YOUR PRETTY LITTLE FRIEND ROSE AND THIS AS BEING THE COMMAND OF HIS KING AND OVERLORD
HAD ACQUIRED AN ATHLETIC AND HARDY CHARACTER WHICH NOT ONLY VERIFIED THE COLONEL'S NARRATION BUT SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED ALL THE INHABITANTS OF WAVERLEY HONOUR THEY CROWDED TO SEE TO HEAR HIM AND TO SING HIS PRAISES
OR IN A SCUTCHEON OF PRETENCE OR IN A SEPARATE SHIELD PERHAPS ANY WAY THAT WOULD NOT BLEMISH MY OWN COAT OF ARMS AND AS TO ROSE I DON'T SEE WHAT OBJECTION SHE COULD HAVE MADE IF HER FATHER WAS SATISFIED PERHAPS THE SAME THAT YOUR SISTER MAKES TO ME YOU BEING SATISFIED
WHICH LED TO THE SUMMIT OF A RISING GROUND THE COUNTRY WAS UNINCLOSED BEING PART OF A VERY EXTENSIVE HEATH OR COMMON BUT IT WAS FAR FROM LEVEL EXHIBITING IN MANY PLACES HOLLOWS FILLED WITH FURZE AND BROOM
WHICH FERGUS THREW FROM HIM WITH GREAT PASSION I WISH TO GOD HE SAID THE OLD DEN WOULD TUMBLE DOWN UPON THE HEADS OF THE FOOLS WHO ATTACK AND THE KNAVES WHO DEFEND IT I SEE WAVERLEY YOU THINK I AM MAD LEAVE US EVAN BUT BE WITHIN CALL
AND DIED AWAY UPON THE BREEZE AS THEY RAPIDLY PROCEEDED WHEN THEY HAD WALKED ABOUT HALF AN HOUR STILL ALONG OPEN AND WASTE GROUND OF THE SAME DESCRIPTION THEY CAME TO THE STUMP OF AN ANCIENT OAK WHICH FROM ITS RELICS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN AT ONE TIME A TREE OF VERY LARGE SIZE
WELL SIR AS ROSE BRADWARDINE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE MADE A SUITABLE MATCH FOR ME BUT FOR THIS IDIOTICAL PREDILECTION OF HER FATHER FOR THE HEIR MALE
BUILT UP BY OUR FATHERS IN SIXTEEN FORTY TWO
SO WAVERLEY YOU ARE THERE SAID THE CHIEF AFTER A MOMENT'S RECOLLECTION YES I REMEMBER I ASKED YOU TO SHARE MY TRIUMPH AND YOU HAVE COME TO WITNESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT WE SHALL CALL IT EVAN NOW PRESENTED THE WRITTEN REPORT HE HAD IN HIS HAND
WHERE THEIR APPEARANCE EXCITED NEITHER SURPRISE NOR CURIOSITY IN THE FEW PEASANTS WHOM THE LABOURS OF THE HARVEST BEGAN TO SUMMON FROM THEIR REPOSE THE PARTY CROSSED AN ANCIENT AND NARROW BRIDGE OF SEVERAL ARCHES AND TURNING TO THE LEFT UP AN AVENUE OF HUGE OLD SYCAMORES
I AM TO HAVE A PARTICULAR AUDIENCE TO MORROW SAID FERGUS TO WAVERLEY OVERNIGHT AND YOU MUST MEET ME TO WISH ME JOY OF THE SUCCESS WHICH I SECURELY ANTICIPATE
NOT TO PRESS MY JUST AND REASONABLE REQUEST AT THIS MOMENT AFTER THIS PUT YOUR FAITH IN PRINCES AND DID YOUR AUDIENCE END HERE END O NO I WAS DETERMINED TO LEAVE HIM NO PRETENCE FOR HIS INGRATITUDE
INTIMATED NO PURPOSE OF PLUNDER AND WHO IN ALL OTHER POINTS APPEARED TO CONSULT HIS WELFARE AND HIS WISHES IT OCCURRED TO OUR HERO THAT DURING THE WORST CRISIS OF HIS ILLNESS A FEMALE FIGURE YOUNGER THAN HIS OLD HIGHLAND NURSE HAD APPEARED TO FLIT AROUND HIS COUCH
THE OLD GENTLEMAN PUT AN END TO THE CONTEST BY SECURING IT ON THE OUTSIDE WITH A NAIL SO EFFECTUALLY THAT THE DOOR COULD NOT BE DRAWN TILL THIS EXTERIOR IMPEDIMENT WAS REMOVED WHILE MUSING UPON THE CAUSE OF THIS CONTRADICTORY SPIRIT IN PERSONS WHOSE CONDUCT
MISTER PEMBROKE WHO SECRETLY EXTOLLED HIS SPIRIT AND COURAGE IN EMBRACING THE GENUINE CAUSE OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND CENSURED HIS PUPIL GENTLY NEVERTHELESS FOR BEING SO CARELESS OF HIS MANUSCRIPTS WHICH INDEED HE SAID
FOR HE HEARD AT NO GREAT DISTANCE AN ENGLISH SENTINEL CALL OUT ALL'S WELL THE HEAVY SOUND SUNK ON THE NIGHT WIND DOWN THE WOODY GLEN AND WAS ANSWERED BY THE ECHOES OF ITS BANKS A SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH TIME THE SIGNAL WAS REPEATED FAINTER AND FAINTER AS IF AT A GREATER AND GREATER DISTANCE
UNACCUSTOMED TO THE ADDRESS AND MANNERS OF A POLISHED COURT IN WHICH CHARLES WAS EMINENTLY SKILFUL
MOREOVER THE READER WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO IMAGINE THAT JOB HOUGHTON AND HIS DAME WERE SUITABLY PROVIDED FOR ALTHOUGH THEY COULD NEVER BE PERSUADED THAT THEIR SON FELL OTHERWISE THAN FIGHTING BY THE YOUNG SQUIRE'S SIDE SO THAT ALICK
THE HIGHLANDERS BEGAN THEIR MARCH SWIFTLY YET WITH THE MOST CAUTIOUS SILENCE WAVERLEY HAD LITTLE TIME OR INDEED DISPOSITION FOR OBSERVATION AND COULD ONLY DISCERN THAT THEY PASSED AT SOME DISTANCE FROM A LARGE BUILDING IN THE WINDOWS OF WHICH A LIGHT OR TWO YET SEEMED TO TWINKLE
IN THIS CITY AT LEAST ANSWERED HIS FRIEND
AFTER A LONG CONSULTATION AMONG THEMSELVES SIX OF THE PARTY LEFT THE HUT WITH THEIR ARMS LEAVING BEHIND AN OLD AND A YOUNG MAN THE FORMER ADDRESSED WAVERLEY AND BATHED THE CONTUSIONS WHICH SWELLING AND LIVID COLOUR NOW MADE CONSPICUOUS HIS OWN PORTMANTEAU
AND WITH MUCH COURTESY BID HIM WELCOME TO THE CASTLE THE GOVERNOR FOR SO WE MUST TERM HIM HAVING CONDUCTED WAVERLEY TO A HALF RUINOUS APARTMENT WHERE HOWEVER THERE WAS A SMALL CAMP BED AND HAVING OFFERED HIM ANY REFRESHMENT WHICH HE DESIRED WAS THEN ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM
WAVERLEY OR TIS SIXTY YEARS SINCE
AND AS IT SEEMED BY THE SIDE OF A BROOK FOR WAVERLEY HEARD THE RUSHING OF A CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WATER ALTHOUGH ITS STREAM WAS INVISIBLE IN THE DARKNESS THE PARTY AGAIN STOPPED BEFORE A SMALL AND RUDELY CONSTRUCTED HOVEL THE DOOR WAS OPEN
WHICH TAKES ROOT WITHIN THE PLACE BESIEGED OR IT MAY BE OF THE HERB WOODBIND PARIETARIA OR PELLITORY WE SHALL NOT I SAY GAIN IT BY THIS SAME BLOCKADE OR LEAGUER OF EDINBURGH CASTLE
THE MORROW CAME AND IN THE CHIEF'S APARTMENT HE FOUND ENSIGN MACCOMBICH WAITING TO MAKE REPORT OF HIS TURN OF DUTY IN A SORT OF DITCH WHICH THEY HAD DUG ACROSS THE CASTLE HILL AND CALLED A TRENCH
AND RAW HEAD AND BLOODY BONE STORIES WITH WHICH HE ASTONISHED THE SERVANTS HALL BUT ALTHOUGH THESE IMPORTANT MATTERS MAY BE BRIEFLY TOLD IN NARRATIVE LIKE A NEWSPAPER REPORT OF A CHANCERY SUIT YET WITH ALL THE URGENCY WHICH WAVERLEY COULD USE THE REAL TIME WHICH THE LAW PROCEEDINGS OCCUPIED
THE FOREMOST OF THE BAND BEING THE STOUTEST AND MOST ACTIVE HAD PUSHED ON AND HAVING SURMOUNTED THE ASCENT WERE OUT OF KEN FOR THE PRESENT GILFILLAN WITH THE PEDLAR AND THE SMALL PARTY WHO WERE WAVERLEY'S MORE IMMEDIATE GUARD
WHOSE BONNET AND PLAID STREAMING IN THE WIND DECLARED HIM TO BE A HIGHLANDER AS A BROAD WHITE ENSIGN WHICH FLOATED FROM ANOTHER TOWER ANNOUNCED THAT THE GARRISON WAS HELD BY THE INSURGENT ADHERENTS OF THE HOUSE OF STUART PASSING HASTILY THROUGH A SMALL AND MEAN TOWN
WHY IT IS WELL IT IS WRITTEN CURSE NOT THE KING NO NOT IN THY THOUGHT WHY HE ANSWERED THAT TRULY HE WAS GLAD I HAD MADE HIM MY CONFIDANT TO PREVENT MORE GRIEVOUS DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HE COULD ASSURE ME UPON THE WORD OF A PRINCE
IN AMENDS IT WAS ARRANGED THAT EDWARD WAVERLEY AND HIS LADY WHO WITH THE BARON PROPOSED AN IMMEDIATE JOURNEY TO WAVERLEY HONOUR SHOULD IN THEIR WAY SPEND A FEW DAYS AT AN ESTATE WHICH COLONEL TALBOT HAD BEEN TEMPTED TO PURCHASE IN SCOTLAND AS A VERY GREAT BARGAIN
THE HAPPINESS OF THEIR MEETING WAS NOT TARNISHED BY A SINGLE WORD OF REPROACH ON THE CONTRARY WHATEVER PAIN SIR EVERARD AND MISSUS RACHEL HAD FELT DURING WAVERLEY'S PERILOUS ENGAGEMENT WITH THE YOUNG CHEVALIER
AS WELL AS ON THAT OF THE ELDERLY HIGHLANDER TO PERMIT THE DOOR OF THE BED TO BE LEFT OPEN SO THAT HE MIGHT AMUSE HIMSELF WITH OBSERVING THEIR MOTIONS AND AT LENGTH AFTER WAVERLEY HAD REPEATEDLY DRAWN OPEN AND THEY HAD AS FREQUENTLY SHUT THE HATCHWAY OF HIS CAGE
BUT WHEN THE STORY DRAWS NEAR ITS CLOSE WE HURRY OVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES HOWEVER IMPORTANT WHICH YOUR IMAGINATION MUST HAVE FORESTALLED AND LEAVE YOU TO SUPPOSE THOSE THINGS WHICH IT WOULD BE ABUSING YOUR PATIENCE TO RELATE AT LENGTH
WHICH AGITATED HIS WHOLE FRAME OF MORTALITY AS HE ENTERED THE APARTMENT HE UNBUCKLED HIS BROADSWORD AND THROWING IT DOWN WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT THE WEAPON ROLLED TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM I KNOW NOT WHAT HE EXCLAIMED
BY WHOM HE WAS SURE TO BE KINDLY RECEIVED AND IN THE PRESENT STATE OF HIS MIND THE RIGOUR WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED FULLY ABSOLVED HIM IN HIS OWN EYES FROM HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE EXISTING GOVERNMENT THE OTHER PROJECT WAS TO ENDEAVOUR TO ATTAIN A SCOTTISH SEAPORT
FOR A DROPPING SHOT OR TWO WERE HEARD AT A GREAT DISTANCE WHICH SEEMED TO SERVE AS AN ADDITION TO THE MIRTH OF DUNCAN AND HIS COMRADES THE MOUNTAINEER NOW RESUMED THE ARMS WITH WHICH HE HAD ENTRUSTED OUR HERO GIVING HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE DANGERS OF THE JOURNEY WERE HAPPILY SURMOUNTED
WERE NEAR THE TOP OF THE ASCENT AND THE REMAINDER STRAGGLED AFTER THEM AT A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL SUCH WAS THE SITUATION OF MATTERS WHEN THE PEDLAR MISSING AS HE SAID A LITTLE DOGGIE WHICH BELONGED TO HIM
IN HIS EASY AND GRACEFUL MANNERS WAVERLEY AFTERWARDS THOUGHT HE COULD HAVE DISCOVERED HIS HIGH BIRTH AND RANK ALTHOUGH THE STAR ON HIS BREAST AND THE EMBROIDERED GARTER AT HIS KNEE HAD NOT APPEARED AS ITS INDICATIONS LET ME PRESENT TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS SAID FERGUS BOWING PROFOUNDLY
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX AN INCIDENT THE DINNER HOUR OF SCOTLAND SIXTY YEARS SINCE WAS TWO O'CLOCK
HE DELIVERED TO EDWARD A SWORD AND STEEL PISTOL AND POINTING UP THE TRACK LAID HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS OWN CLAYMORE AS IF TO MAKE HIM SENSIBLE THEY MIGHT HAVE OCCASION TO USE FORCE TO MAKE GOOD THEIR PASSAGE HE THEN PLACED HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF THE PARTY WHO MOVED UP THE PATHWAY IN SINGLE
IT SMOKES AND THUNDERS DOWN TAKING A ROOD AT EVERY SPRING CLEARING HEDGE AND DITCH LIKE A YORKSHIRE HUNTSMAN AND BECOMING MOST FURIOUSLY RAPID IN ITS COURSE WHEN IT IS NEAREST TO BEING CONSIGNED TO REST FOR EVER
A YOUNG MAN WEARING HIS OWN FAIR HAIR DISTINGUISHED BY THE DIGNITY OF HIS MIEN AND THE NOBLE EXPRESSION OF HIS WELL FORMED AND REGULAR FEATURES ADVANCED OUT OF A CIRCLE OF MILITARY GENTLEMEN AND HIGHLAND CHIEFS BY WHOM HE WAS SURROUNDED
THAT MY PATENT MUST BE SUPPRESSED FOR THE PRESENT FOR FEAR OF DISGUSTING THAT RASCALLY COWARD AND FAINEANT NAMING THE RIVAL CHIEF OF HIS OWN CLAN WHO HAS NO BETTER TITLE TO BE A CHIEFTAIN THAN I TO BE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND WHO IS PLEASED TO SHELTER HIS DASTARDLY RELUCTANCE
SAID THE YOUNG CHEVALIER INTERRUPTING HIM I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR INTERRUPTING YOU MY DEAR MAC IVOR
AND THE INSIDE OF THE PREMISES APPEARED AS UNCOMFORTABLE AND RUDE AS ITS SITUATION AND EXTERIOR FOREBODED THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF A FLOOR OF ANY KIND THE ROOF SEEMED RENT IN SEVERAL PLACES THE WALLS WERE COMPOSED OF LOOSE STONES AND TURF
AND WHY SHOULD SHE APPARENTLY DESIRE CONCEALMENT FANCY IMMEDIATELY AROUSED HERSELF AND TURNED TO FLORA MAC IVOR BUT AFTER A SHORT CONFLICT BETWEEN HIS EAGER DESIRE TO BELIEVE SHE WAS IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD GUARDING LIKE AN ANGEL OF MERCY THE COUCH OF HIS SICKNESS
DANIEL BURTON WAS ON HIS FEET NOW TRYING TO SHAKE OFF THE CONFLICTING EMOTIONS THAT WERE ALL BUT PARALYZING HIM WHY YOU CAN'T GET ANYTHING FOR THOSE DA JUST IN TIME HE PULLED HIMSELF UP AT THAT MOMENT TOO HE SAW SUSAN'S FACE HE SAT DOWN LIMPLY
IF HE PREFERRED TO HAVE AN IGNORANT SERVANT GIRL TAKE CARE OF HIS POOR AFFLICTED SON SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY BUT THAT CERTAINLY HE COULD NOT EXPECT HER TO STAY TOO ESPECIALLY AFTER BEING INSULTED AS SHE HAD BEEN
YOU JEST WAIT AN SEE THE FATE THAT I'VE CUT OUT FOR YOU WE'LL BE SO PROUD WE'LL LAUGH ALOUD AN YOU'LL BE LAUGHIN TOO I MADE THAT UP LAST NIGHT WHEN I LAID AWAKE THINKIN OF ALL THE FINE THINGS WE WAS GOIN TO HAVE YOU DO
SUSAN'S FACE WAS AGHAST TO WORK I SAID REPEATED DANIEL BURTON SHARPLY I SHALL WANT BREAKFAST AT SEVEN O'CLOCK SUSAN HE TURNED AWAY PLAINLY INDICATING THAT FOR HIM THE MATTER WAS CLOSED BUT FOR SUSAN THE MATTER WAS NOT CLOSED
DO WHAT TAKE DOWN JOHN MC GUIRE'S STORY
THEN TIRED BUT HAPPY SHE WENT TO BED IT WAS THE NEXT DAY THAT THE NURSE WENT AND THAT MISSUS COLEBROOK CAME THE DOCTOR SAID THAT KEITH MIGHT BE DRESSED NOW ANY DAY THAT HE SHOULD BE DRESSED IN FACT AND BEGIN TO TAKE SOME EXERCISE
CAN'T I PLEASE AND THIS FROM SUSAN THIS PALPITATING PLEADING PLEASE DANIEL BURTON WITH A HELPLESS GESTURE THAT EXPRESSED EMBARRASSMENT DISMAY BEWILDERMENT AND RESIGNATION THREW UP BOTH HANDS AND SETTLED BACK IN HIS CHAIR
BUT I DO KNOW AN THAT'S THE FUNNY PART OF IT KEITH SHE CRIED LISTEN
SAID KEITH VERY QUIETLY FROM THE BED AND SUSAN NOT DARING TO UNCLOSE HER LIPS
I ACTED AS IF ANYTHING WAS THE MATTER STAMMERED THE YOUTH WELL YOU DO NOW TELL ME WHAT IS IT NOTHING NOTHING SUSAN NOTHING YOU CAN HELP KEITH WAS PACING BACK AND FORTH AND UP AND DOWN THE LIVING ROOM
SUSAN'S JOY THEN AT KEITH'S GRACIOUS RESPONSE TO VISITORS ATTENTIONS CHANGED TO A VAGUE UNEASINESS BEHIND AND BEYOND IT ALL LAY AN INTANGIBLE SOMETHING UPON WHICH SUSAN COULD NOT PLACE HER FINGER
AND FINGER THE BOOKS ON THE LITTLE TABLE BY THE WINDOW SHE CREPT BACK TO HER KITCHEN AND RATTLED STILL MORE LOUDLY THE POTS AND PANS IN THE SINK JUST BEFORE THE NOON MEAL KEITH APPEARED ONCE MORE AT THE KITCHEN DOOR SUSAN
YOU JEST WAIT THE FIRST ELEMENTAL THING IS TO LEARN HIM SELF DEFIANCE SO HE CAN DO THINGS FOR HIMSELF
THE BIG SOFA IN THE HALL DOWNSTAIRS AND THE DROPLEAF TABLE IN THE DINING ROOM HUMPH BUT WILL HE PAY ANYTHING FOR THEM THINGS
WHERE I DIDN'T KNOW AGAIN NONSENSE KEITH SUSAN WAS BEGINNING TO TALK MORE LIKE HERSELF GO BACK TO BE SICK OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK AN BE SICK LISTEN DON'T YOU WORRY AN DON'T YOU FRET SOMETHIN BETTER IS COMIN YET SOMETHIN FINE WHAT'LL YOU BET
ONLY I I SUPPOSE I WOULD HAVE TO BE DOROTHY PARKMAN NOW I COULDN'T KEEP THE OTHER UP FOREVER OF COURSE BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL SHE STOPPED AND LOOKED AGAIN FEARFULLY TOWARD THE CLOSED DOORS SUSAN HOW
UNCONSCIOUSLY DANIEL BURTON SAT A LITTLE STRAIGHTER AND LIFTED HIS CHIN THOUGH HIS EYES WERE SMILING SOMETHING ELSE YES IT'S POETRY
WHEN A MAN'S GOT A COUPLE OF HUNS COMING STRAIGHT FOR HIM AND HE KNOWS HE'S GOT TO GET EM BOTH AT ONCE YOU CAN'T VERY WELL SING OUT HERE
THEN SHE TOLD SOMETHING OF HERSELF AND OF HER HABIT OF TURNING EVERYTHING INTO RHYME FOR SHE FELT IT DUE TO THEM SHE SAID THAT THEY KNOW SOMETHING OF THE PERSON WITH WHOM THEY WERE DEALING SHE TOUCHED AGAIN ON THE POVERTY OF THE HOUSEHOLD
OR ON HIS OWN WITH JOHN MC GUIRE IT IS NO WONDER SURELY THAT VERY SOON THE TOWN CEASED TO STARE AND GOSSIP OR EVEN TO SHAKE WISE HEADS OF PROPHECY NANCY HOLWORTHY'S DEATH WAS TWO MONTHS IN THE PAST
T AIN'T FOR ME TO PRETENSE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE INFERRIN TO BUT JEST LET ME TELL YOU THIS
I'LL TAKE MY MEALS DOWN HERE AFTER THIS WHY KEITH HOWEVER IN THE WORLD DID YOU THEN SUSAN PULLED HERSELF UP GOOD BOY KEITH THAT WILL MAKE IT LOTS EASIER SHE SAID CHEERFULLY IMPERSONALLY
YOU CAN YOU CAN HOW MAKE HIM WRITE IT DOWN JEST AS HE TALKS HE CAN HE WANTS TO HE'S ALWAYS WANTED TO THEN PUBLISH IT IN A BOOK SO
I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT THERE TO WALK ANY MORE NOT ANY MORE I DON'T WANT TO GO ANYWHERE WHERE ANYBODY'LL SEE ME SHUCKS SUSAN'S VOICE WAS HARSHLY UNSTEADY AGAIN SEE YOU INDEED WHY WE'RE GOIN TO BE SO PROUD OF YOU WE'LL WANT THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE YOU
SO SHORTLY THAT MISSUS MC GUIRE OPENED HER EYES A BIT AND WONDERED WHY SUSAN'S LIPS HAD SNAPPED TIGHT SHUT IN THAT STRAIGHT HARD LINE BUT WHAT AILS THE WOMAN SHE MUTTERED TO HERSELF VEXEDLY AS SHE CROSSED THE BACK YARD TO HER OWN DOOR
WEARILY INDIFFERENT AS TO EVERYTHING THAT WAS TAKING PLACE ABOUT HIM LAY MOTIONLESS AS USUAL HIS FACE TURNED TOWARD THE WALL AND AT TEN O'CLOCK MISSUS COLEBROOK WENT FIVE MINUTES LATER DANIEL BURTON ENTERED THE KITCHEN
SURE I DID AN KEITH IT WAS GREAT FUN REALLY JEST TO SEE HOW SMART I COULD BE DOIN IT AN I TIMED MYSELF TOO IT TOOK ME TWENTY FIVE MINUTES THE FIRST TIME DEAR DEAR BUT I WAS CLUMSY BUT I CAN DO IT LOTS QUICKER NOW THOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL EVER DO IT AS QUICK AS YOU WILL
AND THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER WAY TO DO IT THAN TO TELL HIM OF THESE BRAVE SOLDIERS WHO WERE DOING SOMETHING SO REALLY WORTH WHILE IN THE WORLD AN HE'S SO INTERESTED THE DEAR BOY SHE CONCLUDED WITH A SIGH
THAT I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE IN HIS AUDIENCE BUT KEITH HE WOULDN'T MIND HE WOULDN'T MIND A BIT URGED SUSAN IF HE DIDN'T KNOW AN' OH NO HE WOULDN'T MIND BEING CHEATED AND DECEIVED AND MADE A FOOL OF JUST BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SEE
AND IT WOULDN'T BE EASY TO TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND HE'D NEVER FORGIVE IT I KNOW HE WOULDN'T TO THINK I'D TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF HIS NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE
SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT SHE NEED NOT HAVE WORRIED FOR IF KEITH HAD RECOGNIZED IT FOR WHAT IT WAS HE MADE NO SIGN AND EVEN SUSAN HERSELF COULD FIND NO FAULT WITH HIS BEHAVIOR HE WAS CORDIAL CHEERY ALMOST GAY OUTWARDLY
LET ME TELL YOU THIS DANIEL BURTON THAT BOY HAS MORE CONSOLATION FOR YOUR FEELIN'S THAN YOU HAVE FOR HIS EVERY TIME DIDN'T HE JEST COME TO ME AN BEG TO EAT WITH ME CAUSE HIS DAD DIDN'T LIKE TO SEE DISAGREEABLE THINGS AN' THE MAN WHEELED SHARPLY
BUT WHICH FILLED HER HEART WITH DISTRUST AND SO STILL SHE KEPT HER EYES ON KEITH IN JUNE DOROTHY PARKMAN CAME TO HINSDALE SHE CAME AT ONCE TO SEE SUSAN BUT SHE WOULD ONLY STEP INSIDE THE HALL AND SHE SPOKE LOW AND HURRIEDLY
OH IT WAS WONDERFUL AN THERE
BUT NO STARTLING ALTERATIONS OR IMPROVEMENTS WERE PROMISED BY THE EVIDENCE AND KEITH WAS STILL
I'M GLAD YOUR COURAGE IS STILL GOOD SUSAN BUT I'M AFRAID THE DEAR PUBLIC IS GOING TO APPRECIATE YOUR POEMS ABOUT THE WAY IT DOES MY PICTURES
OH KEITH WHY HE'D EVEN FORGET HIS EYES THEN IT WOULD HELP SOME KEITH DREW IN HIS BREATH AND HELD IT A MOMENT SUSPENDED AND HE'D EVEN BE HELPING US TO WIN OUT OVER THERE
SUSAN THE BOY PUT OUT HIS HAND GROPINGLY TURNING HIS HEAD WITH THE PITIFUL UNCERTAINTY OF THE BLIND SUSAN YOU ARE THERE AREN'T YOU
THE BOY HIS FACE TO THE WALL LAY MOTIONLESS BUT HE WAS NOT ASLEEP SUSAN KNEW THAT FOR SHE HAD HEARD HIS VOICE NOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE BIDDING THE NURSE GOOD BYE FOR ONE BRIEF MOMENT SUSAN HESITATED THEN BRISKLY SHE STEPPED INTO THE ROOM WITH A CHEERY
AND TO THINK OF ALL THAT TO DAY BEING WASTED ON A BLIND BABY TIED TO A PICTURE PUZZLE MOANED KEITH RESUMING HIS NERVOUS PACING OF THE ROOM IF ONLY A MAN A REAL MAN COULD HAVE HEARD HIM ONE THAT COULD GO AND DO A MAN'S WORK WHY SUSAN
AND IT WAS THE WAY YOU DID IT WITH NEVER A WORD OR A HINT THAT I WAS DIFFERENT YOU DID THINGS AND YOU MADE ME DO THINGS WITHOUT REMINDING ME ALL THE TIME THAT I WAS BLIND I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT FIRST DAY WHEN YOU TOLD
NOT EVEN USING HIS CANE TO DEFINE THE FAMILIAR LIMITS OF HIS PATHWAY SUDDENLY HE TURNED AND STOPPED SHORT HIS WHOLE BODY QUIVERING WITH EMOTION SUSAN I CAN'T I CAN'T STAND IT HE MOANED
TAKING UP AND SETTING DOWN ONE OBJECT AFTER ANOTHER IN THE AIMLESS FASHION OF ONE WHOSE FINGERS ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY THE MIND WHEN THE DOCTOR HAD GONE SUSAN DID NOT WAIT FOR DANIEL BURTON TO SEEK HER OUT SHE WENT AT ONCE TO THE STUDIO
LOOKING NOT A LITTLE STARTLED AS HE FOLLOWED HER WITH HALF RELUCTANT FEET IN THE STUDIO SUSAN FLOURISHED ACCUSING ARMS LOOK AT THAT
IT COSTS MONEY FOR THAT SUSAN'S FACE FELL
TELLING OF THE FAILURE OF THE SECOND OPERATION SUSAN HAD READ IT AND ACCEPTED IT WITH STERNLY CONTROLLED EYES THAT DID NOT SHED ONE TEAR BUT WHEN KEITH'S LETTER CAME NOT EVEN MENTIONING THE OPERATION HER SELF CONTROL SNAPPED AND SHE BURST OPENLY INTO TEARS
SUSAN WAS STILL BREATHLESS STILL SHINING EYED A STRANGE EXOTIC SUSAN THAT DANIEL BURTON HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE I'VE HEARD THAT WRITERS SOME WRITERS GET LOTS OF MONEY MISTER BURTON AN I CAN WRITE MORE LOTS MORE
BUT IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT KEITH IT WAS A WEARY SPENT NERVELESS KEITH THAT LAY BACK ON THE PILLOW WITH SCARCELY SO MUCH AS THE FLUTTER OF AN EYELID TO SHOW LIFE IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN GET YOU KEITH SHE ASKED
I I SHALL BE ASHAMED OF YOU IF YOU AIN'T AND WITHOUT ANOTHER GLANCE AT THE BOY AND BEFORE HE COULD POSSIBLY PROTEST SUSAN HURRIED FROM THE ROOM HER HEAD WAS STILL HIGH AND HER VOICE STILL DETERMINEDLY CLEAR BUT IN THE HALL OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM
I TRIED TO DO IT TWO OR THREE TIMES INDEED I DID BUT THE WORDS JUST WOULDN'T COME AND NOW I DON'T KNOW WHEN I CAN TELL HIM
INDEED I'M HERE SHE CRIED GAYLY GIVING A WARM CLASP TO HIS EAGERLY OUTSTRETCHED HAND HOW DO YOU DO SUSAN WAS JUST SAYING BUT SUSAN WAS GONE WITH UPFLUNG HANDS AND A LOOK THAT SAID
THERE WAS INCREDULOUS HURT AMAZEMENT IN THE BOY'S VOICE BUT SUSAN WAS VISIBLY STEELING HERSELF AGAINST IT WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT I'M LOAFIN ALL DAY AN YOUR AUNT GONE NOW AN ME WITH IT ALL ON MY HANDS SHE DEMANDED
AND AFTER A FRUITLESS PUTTERING ABOUT THE KITCHEN SUSAN MARCHED DETERMINEDLY UPSTAIRS TO KEITH'S ROOM AT THE DOOR SHE DID HESITATE A BREATHLESS MINUTE THEN RESOLUTELY SHE PUSHED IT OPEN THE BOY FULLY DRESSED STOOD BY THE BED
NEW THINGS OF INTEREST THAT HE WAS SEEING HE SAID NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT THE OPERATION HE DID SAY THAT THERE WAS A BIG DOCTOR COMING FROM PARIS WHOM HE WAS GOING TO SEE IN MAY HOWEVER THAT WAS ALL WHEN THE DOCTOR'S LETTER HAD COME
ONLY A FAINT SHAKE OF THE HEAD ANSWERED HER THE DOCTOR SAYS YOU'RE LOTS BETTER KEITH THERE WAS NO SORT OF REPLY TO THIS AND FOR ANOTHER LONG MINUTE SUSAN SAT TENSE AND MOTIONLESS WATCHING THE BOY'S FACE
I KNOW I KNOW NODDED SUSAN IT'S THAT WAY WITH ME IN MY POETRY I JEST HAVE TO GET RIGHT AHEAD WHILE THE FUSE BURNS AN SPELL EM SOMEHOW ANYHOW SO'S TO GET EM DOWN WHILE I'M IN THE FIT OF IT
SPELT AGGRESSIVE DETERMINATION AS SHE ENTERED THE STUDIO AND DANIEL BURTON SHIFTED UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR AS HE FACED HER NOR DID HE FAIL TO NOTE THAT SHE CARRIED SOME FOLDED PAPERS IN HER HAND YES YES SUSAN I KNOW
BUT HE OBVIOUSLY WORKED HALF HEARTEDLY AND HE STILL ROAMED THE HOUSE AFTER READING THE EVENING PAPER AND SPENT EVEN MORE TIME BEFORE THE GREAT WAR MAP ON HIS STUDIO WALL TRUE ALSO DISGRUNTLED TRADESMEN NO LONGER RANG PEREMPTORY PEALS ON THE DOORBELL
YOU'VE BEEN SICK VERY SICK HOW LONG OH SEVERAL WEEKS IT'S OCTOBER NOW AND I'VE BEEN BLIND ALL THAT TIME YES BUT I HAVEN'T KNOWN I WAS BLIND NO I WANT TO GO BACK
NO YOU DON'T RAKE ME INTO THIS THING YOUNG LADY AS PLAINLY AS IF SHE HAD SPOKEN THE WORDS THEMSELVES IN THE LIVING ROOM A MINUTE LATER KEITH BEGAN EAGER QUESTIONING WHEN DID YOU COME YESTERDAY AND YOU CAME TO SEE ME
WOMEN BROUGHT HIM JELLY AND FRUIT AND MEN CLAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID HOW ARE YOU MY BOY IN VOICES THAT WERE NOT QUITE STEADY
WHEN DANIEL BURTON THIS MORNING THEREFORE HEARD SUSAN SINGING THIS SONG HE WAS IN NO DOUBT AS TO SUSAN'S STATE OF MIND A FACT WHICH CERTAINLY DID NOT ADD TO HIS OWN SERENITY UPSTAIRS KEITH
A FLAPPY TRANSPARALLEL JELLYFISH DRAT HER BUT I AIN'T GOIN TO GIVE UP NOT MUCH I AIN'T AND SUSAN ATTACKED THE LITTLE KITCHEN STOVE WITH A VIGOR THAT WOULD HAVE BROUGHT TERROR TO THE CLINKERS OF A FURNACE FIRE POT
THAT EVENING IN HER OWN ROOM SUSAN PORED OVER THE TWO INEXPENSIVE MAGAZINES THAT CAME TO THE HOUSE
HIM THAT YOU DON'T MIND BEING WITH BLIND FOLKS A MITE SO NOW HE WON'T CARE A BIT WHEN HE KNOWS YOU ARE DOROTHY PARKMAN BUT THE GIRL SHOOK HER HEAD AGAIN YES I KNOW HE MIGHT NOT MIND THAT PART PERHAPS
DOCTOR STEWART CAME ON AGAIN TO TAKE HIS DAUGHTER BACK FOR THE HOLIDAYS HE CALLED AT ONCE TO SEE MISTER BURTON AND THE TWO HAD A LONG CONFERENCE IN THE STUDIO WHILE SUSAN FEVERISHLY MOVED FROM ROOM TO ROOM DOWNSTAIRS
MAYBE YOU THINK I HAIN'T GOT ANYTHING TO DO BUT TRESPASS UP AN DOWN THEM STAIRS ALL DAY WAITIN ON YOU WHEN YOU ARE PERFECTLY CAPACIOUS OF WAITIN ON YOURSELF SOME WHY SUSAN
WITH DANIEL BURTON'S KIND PERMISSION THEREFORE THE DOCTOR WOULD KEEP KEITH WHERE HE WAS FOR THE PRESENT PENDING THE ARRIVAL OF THE GREAT SPECIALIST IT WAS A BITTER BLOW
YOU'D NEVER GUESS IN A MILLION YEARS SO I'M GOIN TO TELL YOU FOR THE LAST THREE MORNIN'S SHE'S TIED UP HER EYES WITH A HANDKERCHIEF AN THEN DRESSED HERSELF JEST TO MAKE SURE IT COULD BE DONE YOU KNOW SUSAN DID YOU REALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME A FAINT TRACE OF INTEREST CAME INTO THE BOY'S FACE
AN I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN WHAT YOU'D SAY TOO IF I'D STOPPED TO THINK WELL I MUST BE GOIN ANYHOW I ONLY CAME OVER TO SHOW YOU THE LETTER FROM MY JOHN I'M SURE I WISH'T WAS
BUT THEY'RE NOT YOU THERE'S NOT ANY ONE LIKE YOU CUT IN THE YOUTH FERVENTLY AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO STAY A LONG TIME AREN'T YOU
AT THE BURTON HOMESTEAD THE CHANGES DID NOT SEEM SO STUPENDOUS AFTER ALL TRUE DANIEL BURTON HAD ABANDONED THE PEDDLING OF PEAS AND BEANS ACROSS THE COUNTER AND HAD AT THE EARNEST SOLICITATION OF HIS SON GOT OUT HIS EASEL AND PLACED A FRESH CANVAS UPON IT
YOU'RE GOIN TO BE BETTER THAN FOLKS JEST COMMON FOLKS YOU'RE GOIN TO DO THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS THAT BUT I CAN'T I'M BLIND I TELL YOU CUT IN THE BOY I CAN'T DO ANYTHING NOW BUT YOU CAN AN YOU'RE GOIN TO INSISTED SUSAN AGAIN YOU JEST WAIT TILL I TELL YOU
BUT WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY JOHN MC GUIRE WOULD BE GLAD WHEN HE FOUND OUT HOW WE'D LIED TO HIS POOR BLIND EYES I I JUST COULDN'T HOLD IT IN I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING BUT NEVER MIND THAT NOW SUSAN
THAT ANYBODY MIGHT HAVE WITH THEM PICTURES ALL PUT AWAY AN HIS EASEL HID BEHIND THE DOOR AN NOT A BRUSH OR A CUBE OF PAINT IN SIGHT AN HIM DOLIN OUT VINEGAR AN MOLASSES DOWN TO THAT OLD STORE I TELL YOU IT MADE ME SICK MISTER JENKINS SICK
ER YES YES IT IS THAT'S SO MISTER JENKINS WAS BACKING OUT OF THE ROOM AND LOOKING TOWARD THE STAIRWAY MISTER JENKINS HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE BURTON HOUSEHOLD LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE LEARNED TO TAKE SUSAN AT HER OWN VALUATION WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED
DID KEITH DO THAT HE DID JEST NOW SIR ALL RIGHT SUSAN I I DON'T THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO SAY ANY MORE AND SUSAN AFTER A SHARP GLANCE INTO THE MAN'S HALF AVERTED FACE
HERE SURE I'M HERE BUT SO DUMB WITH AMAZEMENT AN ADMIRATION THAT I COULDN'T OPEN MY HEAD TO SEE YOU STANDIN THERE ALL DRESSED LIKE THAT WHAT DID I TELL YOU I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT NOW COME LET'S GO SEE DAD SHE WAS AT HIS SIDE NOW HER ARM LINKED INTO HIS BUT THE BOY DREW BACK

THERE AIN'T THAT TRUE EVERY WORD OF IT SHE DEMANDED AN THERE AIN'T HARDLY ANY POEM LICENSE IN IT TOO I THINK THEY'RE A WAYS LOTS BETTER WHEN THERE AIN'T BUT SOMETIMES OF COURSE YOU JEST HAVE TO USE IT
CHAPTER ELEVEN NOT PATS BUT SCRATCHES MISSUS COLEBROOK WENT HOME THE NEXT DAY SHE WORE THE AIR OF AN INJURED MARTYR AT BREAKFAST SHE TOLD HER BROTHER THAT OF COURSE
AND TO HEAR HIM TELL IT IT WAS WONDERFUL WONDERFUL I KNOW I KNOW NODDED SUSAN IT WAS LIKE HIS LETTERS YOU COULD SEE THINGS HE MADE YOU SEE EM AN THAT'S WHAT HE ALWAYS DID
BUT SUSAN IT BREAKS MY HEART MOANED THE MAN TURNING QUITE AWAY WHAT IF IT DOES AIN'T HIS BROKE TOO CAN'T YOU THINK OF HIM A LITTLE
YOU'RE GETTIN YOURSELF ALL WORKED UP AN THEN OH MY HOW THAT NURSE WILL SCOLD I SHAN'T BE SPLENDID MOANED THE BOY I SHAN'T BE ANYTHING NOW I SHAN'T BE JERRY OR NED OR DAD
HE COULDN'T DO IT I CAN SEE THAT NOW BUT KEITH COULDN'T YOU DO IT TAKE IT DOWN I MEAN AS HE TALKED LIKE A STYLOGRAPHER KEITH SHOOK HIS HEAD I WISH I COULD
AND STILL THRASHED HIS ARMS WILDLY ABOUT TILL THE LITTLE WHITE POWDER THE NURSE GAVE HIM GOT IN ITS BLESSED WORK AND THEN HE SLEPT KEITH WAS ENTIRELY CONSCIOUS THE NEXT DAY WHEN SUSAN CAME IN TO SIT WITH HIM WHILE THE NURSE TOOK HER REST
BEYOND THE STAIRWAY I HAD TO COME TO SEE HOW HE WAS SHE BEGAN A LITTLE BREATHLESSLY AND I WANTED TO ASK YOU IF YOU THOUGHT I COULD DO ANY GOOD OR OR BE ANY HELP TO HIM EITHER AS MISS STEWART OR DOROTHY PARKMAN
LET HIM GO DOWNTOWN AN COME BACK YOU'D THINK HE'D BEEN TO THE CIRCUS THE WONDERFUL THINGS HE'D TELL ME HE'D SEEN ON THE WAY

HE COULD BE OVER ON THE GRASS RIGHT CLOSE WHERE HE COULD HEAR EVERY WORD AN YOU COULD GET JOHN TO TALKIN AN AS SOON AS HE GOT REALLY STARTED ON A STORY YOUR FATHER COULD BEGIN TO WRITE AN JOHN WOULDN'T KNOW A THING ABOUT IT AN' YES YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT
ONLY DIMLY NOW COULD HE DISCERN LIGHT AT ALL IN A LETTER TO DANIEL BURTON DOCTOR STEWART STATED THE CASE FREELY AND FRANKLY YET HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD NOT GIVEN UP HOPE YET
NONSENSE JEST AS IF A LITTLE THING LIKE BEIN BLIND WAS GOIN TO KEEP YOU FROM BEIN LIKE FOLKS AGAIN SUSAN WAS SPEAKING VERY LOUDLY VERY CHEERFULLY THOUGH WITH FIRST ONE HAND THEN THE OTHER SHE WAS BRUSHING AWAY THE HOT TEARS THAT WERE ROLLING DOWN HER CHEEKS WHY KEITH

WASN'T SHE HERSELF ALWAYS BRAGGIN ABOUT HIS BEIN SO BRAVE HUMPH THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS PLEASIN SOME FOLKS IT SEEMS FINISHED MISSUS MC GUIRE AS SHE ENTERED HER OWN DOOR BUT MISSUS MC GUIRE WAS NOT THE ONLY FREQUENT CALLER
THAT EVENING SUSAN SOUGHT HER EMPLOYER IN THE STUDIO DANIEL BURTON SPENT ALL HIS WAKING HOURS IN THE STUDIO NOW THE WOODS AND FIELDS WERE NOTHING BUT A BARREN DESERT OF LONELINESS TO DANIEL BURTON WITHOUT KEITH THE VERY POISE OF SUSAN'S HEAD
HE THEN WENT ON TO EXPLAIN IN PARIS THERE WAS A NOTED SPECIALIST IN WHOM HE HAD GREAT CONFIDENCE HE WISHED VERY MUCH THAT THIS MAN COULD SEE KEITH TO TAKE KEITH OVER NOW HOWEVER AS WAR CONDITIONS WERE
SHE WATCHED HIM GET UP AND MOVE SLOWLY ALONG THE SIDE OF THE ROOM PICKING HIS WAY SHE WATCHED HIM PAUSE AND MOVE HESITATING FINGERS DOWN THE BACKS OF THE CHAIRS THAT HE ENCOUNTERED BUT WHEN SHE SAW HIM STOP

LEADING THE WAY THROUGH THE DININGROOM IN THE KITCHEN SHE STOPPED AND TURNED EAGERLY

HIS FACE WAS ALIGHT ALMOST EAGER I DID IT I DID IT SUSAN AND IF IT HASN'T BEEN MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES I DID IT SOONER THAN YOU SUSAN TRIED TO SPEAK BUT THE TEARS WERE AGAIN CHASING EACH OTHER DOWN HER CHEEKS
SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN KEITH'S FRENZIED AVOIDANCE OF SUCH CALLERS IN THE OLD DAYS BUT TO HER SURPRISE NOW KEITH WELCOMED MAZIE JOYOUSLY SO JOYOUSLY THAT SUSAN BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT BEHIND THE JOYOUSNESS
ON THESE TWO CHAIRS BY THE BED BUT HOW CAN I DRESS ME WHEN I CAN'T SEE A THING
SO BUSY WAS SHE TRYING TO CONCOCT SOMETHING THAT WOULD TEMPT HER EMPLOYER TO BREAK A FAST THAT WAS BECOMING TERRIFYING TO HER THEN CAME KEITH'S LETTER HE WROTE CHEERFULLY HOPEFULLY HE TOLD OF NEW GAMES THAT HE WAS PLAYING
THE FELLOW THAT READS IT WOULDN'T NEED ANY RECRUITING STATION TO SEND HIM OVER THERE IF THERE WAS ONLY A WAY THAT FATHER COULD
AN MAKE YOU SLIP NO CUBES OF PIG LENT GRAY OR BLACK NOR ANY OTHER COLOR LENT BRIGHTNESS TO THIS DANK WORLD AN HE THE ARTIST THE BRIGHT SOUL WHO BOSSED THIS RANCH

HE WOULDN'T YOU DON'T KNOW JUST TO DAY HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT ABOUT SOME ONE WHO HAD TRIED TO DECEIVE HIM IN A LITTLE THING BECAUSE HE WAS BLIND AND I COULD SEE HOW BITTER HE WAS
I WISH YOUR FATHER SHE BEGAN SUDDENLY SHE STOPPED

HE'S GOT EYES KEITH'S VOICE BROKE A LITTLE
READ THEM HE MUTTERED AS CLEARLY AS HE COULD CONSIDERING THE TIGHTNESS THAT HAD COME INTO HIS THROAT AND SUSAN READ THIS SPRING OH GENTLE SPRING I LOVE THY RILLS I LOVE THY WOODEN ROCKY RILLS
KEITH IT'S MAZIE MAZIE AND DOROTHY CAROLED THE HIGH PITCHED VOICE AGAIN BUT KEITH WITH A TUG SO IMPERATIVE THAT SUSAN HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO OBEY TURNED HIS HEAD QUITE AWAY AS HE GROPED FOR THE DOOR TO GO IN IN THE HALL HE DREW A CHOKING BREATH SUSAN
SUSAN I THOUGHT I HEARD WAS MISS STEWART HERE HE DEMANDED EXCITEDLY WITH ONLY THE BRIEFEST OF HESITATIONS AND A HALF DESPAIRING HALF RELIEVED LOOK INTO SUSAN'S STARTLED EYES THE YOUNG GIRL HURRIED FORWARD
THAT DONE SHE COPIED THE LETTER WORD FOR WORD EXCEPT FOR THE TITLE OF THE POEM SUBMITTED IT WAS A LONG LETTER SUSAN TOLD FIRST OF KEITH AND HIS MISFORTUNE AND THE IMPERATIVE NEED OF MONEY FOR THE OPERATION
IT WAS JUST THE WAY HE TOLD IT THAT'S WHY I KNOW HE COULD HAVE BEEN A WRITER HE COULD MAKE OTHERS SEE EVERYTHING BUT NOW THAT'S ALL OVER NOW HE'LL NEVER BE ANYTHING I CAN SEE HIM
NO I CAN'T LET YOU ALONE KEITH SHE REPLIED VOICE AND MANNER NOW COLDLY FIRM WHY NOT
AND THE SHOUTS AND GROANS OF THE MEN AT OUR SIDE AND THEY NEEDED MEN MORE MEN TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THOSE THAT HAD FALLEN EVEN ONE MAN COUNTED THERE COUNTED FOR OH SO MUCH FOR AT THE LAST THERE WAS JUST ONE MAN LEFT

SHE CHOKED BARELY HAD SUSAN WHIPPED HERSELF INTO PRESENTABLE SHAPE AGAIN WHEN KEITH'S VOICE AT THE KITCHEN DOOR CAUSED HER TO FACE ABOUT WITH A STARTLED CRY I'M DOWNSTAIRS SUSAN THE BOY'S VOICE CHALLENGED HERS FOR COLDNESS NOW

AN TWAS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE SUSAN MOANED TO THE LAW STUDENT
THEN WITH ALMOST A GUILTY LOOK OVER HER SHOULDER SHE STAMMERED KEITH I DON'T WANT YOU TO TALK TO ME BUT I DO WISH YOU'D JUST SPEAK TO ME BUT KEITH ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AGAIN FAINTLY AND TURNED HIS FACE AWAY TO THE WALL
BUT KEITH ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AGAIN AND COMPLAINED OF FEELING OH SO TIRED AND SUSAN LOOKING AT HIS PALE CONSTRAINED FACE DID NOT QUOTE ANY MORE POETRY TO HIM OR TALK ABOUT THE GLORIOUS FUTURE IN STORE FOR HIM
AN KEROSENE CANS DANIEL BURTON HANDS OVER THE COUNTER HE WON'T NEVER BE JEST A COMMON STOREKEEPER HE'LL BE THINKIN FLOWERS AN WOODS AN SUNSETS JEST THE SAME FURTHERMORE AN MOREOVER IN MY OPINION
BUT BARELY HAD SHE FINISHED READING THE LETTER ALOUD WHEN THE REAL OBJECT OF HER VISIT WAS DISCLOSED BY THE TRIUMPHANT WELL SUSAN BETTS
AN'T AIN'T WAGES IT'S IT'S SOMETHIN ELSE SOMETHIN VERY IMPORTUNE THERE WAS A SUBDUED EXCITEMENT IN SUSAN'S FACE AND MANNER THAT WAS PUZZLING YET MOST PROMISING
WHY WHEN I GET TO GOIN THEY JEST COME AUTOCRATICALLY POEMS DO WITHOUT ANY THINKIN AT ALL AN' BUT HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK I OUGHT TO GET GET GOOD HEAVENS WOMAN
BUT THE NEXT MORNING AFTER SHE HAD GIVEN KEITH HIS BREAKFAST NOT OF TOAST AND OATMEAL SHE SUGGESTED BLITHELY THAT HE GET UP AND BE DRESSED WHEN HE REFUSED SHE TRIED COAXING MILDLY THEN MORE STRENUOUSLY
BUT SHE HAD NOT REACHED THE HALL BELOW WHEN THE SOBS SHOOK HER FRAME
AND LET IT PLAINLY BE SEEN THAT SHE HAD HIGH HOPES OF THE MONEY THESE POEMS WERE GOING TO BRING SHE DID NOT SET A PRICE SHE WOULD LEAVE THAT TO THEIR OWN INDISCRETION SHE SAID IN CLOSING IT WAS MIDNIGHT BEFORE SUSAN HAD COPIED THIS LETTER AND PREPARED THE TWO MANUSCRIPTS FOR MAILING

HE HAD ALREADY SAT UP IN A CHAIR EVERY DAY FOR A WEEK AND HE WAS IN NO FURTHER NEED OF MEDICINE EXCEPT A TONIC TO BUILD HIM UP IN FACT ALL EFFORTS NOW SHOULD BE TURNED TOWARD BUILDING HIM UP THE DOCTOR SAID THAT WAS WHAT HE NEEDED
YOU KNOW HE HE DOESN'T LIKE TO SEE DISAGREEABLE THINGS DISAGREEABLE THINGS INDEED EXPLODED SUSAN HER FEATURES WORKING AGAIN WELL I GUESS IF HE CALLS IT DISAGREEABLE TO SEE HIS SON DRESSED UP AN WALKIN AROUND BUT KEITH INTERRUPTED HER ONCE MORE WITH AN EVEN STRONGER PROTEST
ABOUT ME YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULDN'T MIND NOW AND OF COURSE IT CAN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE ABOUT HIS EYES FOR HE DOESN'T NEED FATHER OR OR ANY ONE NOW HER VOICE BROKE
BUT SUSAN JOHN MC GUIRE WOULDN'T TELL IT TO HIM DON'T YOU SEE HE WON'T EVEN SEE ANYBODY BUT ME AND HE DIDN'T TALK LIKE THIS EVEN TO ME UNTIL TO DAY
FOR DAYS AFTER THE LETTER CAME DANIEL BURTON SHUT HIMSELF UP IN HIS STUDIO REFUSING TO SEE ANY ONE BUT SUSAN AND ALMOST REFUSING TO SEE HER SUSAN INDEED HEART BROKEN AS SHE WAS HERSELF

AND THAT WAS ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FEET LOWER OH GRANDPAPA EXCLAIMED PHRONSIE IN GENTLE SURPRISE UNABLE TO COMPASS SUCH FIGURES MISTER KING'S PARTY HAD MADE ONE OR TWO PLEASANT LITTLE JOURNEYS TO THE LAUTERBRUNNEN VALLEY STAYING THERE AND AT MUERREN
STROLLED BY AND LOOKED CURIOUSLY AT THE GROUP BUT AS MISTER KING MET HIS EYE COOLLY AND THE PARTY SEEMED INTELLIGENT AND WELL ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES IT WASN'T NECESSARY TO TENDER HIS SERVICES IF THEY WERE TALKING TO A WORTHLESS VAGABOND
TOMORROW WE MUST SAY GOOD BY MY BOY AND I HEY WHAT EXCLAIMED MISTER KING SETTING HIS COFFEE CUP DOWN NOT VERY GENTLY OUR VACATION CANNOT BE A VERY LONG ONE SAID TOM'S MOTHER WITH A LITTLE SMILE

WHEN PHRONSIE SLIPPED OUT OF HER CHAIR WHERE SHE HAPPENED THIS MORNING TO BE SITTING NEXT TO MOTHER FISHER AND RUNNING AROUND TO HIS CHAIR PIPED OUT
INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION AMID A BABEL OF SOUNDS AND IT WASN'T UNTIL POLLY WAS DRIVING UP IN THE BIG CAB WITH HER PART OF MISTER KING'S FAMILY AS HE CALLED IT THROUGH THE BROAD AVENUES AND BOULEVARDS
CRIED THE LITTLE DOCTOR STANDING ON HIS TIPTOES AND BRISTLING WITH INDIGNATION HIS BIG SPECTACLES HAD SLIPPED TO THE END OF HIS NOSE HIS SHARP LITTLE EYES BLAZING ABOVE THEM FRENCHY STARED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT UNABLE TO FIND HIS TONGUE
CONTINUED MISSUS SELWYN MY FATHER SEEMED NEVER ABLE TO DISCOVER THAT HE WAS DOING THE LAD HARM BY ALL SORTS OF INDULGENCE AND FAMILIARITY WITH HIM A SORT OF HAIL FELLOW WELL MET WAY THAT SURPRISED ME MORE THAN I CAN EXPRESS
BUT THEY CAME BACK TO SIT ON THE BENCHES BY THE WALNUT AND THE PLANE TREES IN FRONT OF THE MATCHLESS JUNGFRAU AND THIS IS BEST OF ALL SAID POLLY AND SO THE DAYS SLIPPED BY TILL ONE MORNING AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE MISSUS SELWYN SAID
OR LISTENED TO IN THE SLIGHTEST HE SAID CALMLY ANYBODY WHO WILL TROT ROUND WITH A KODAK HANGING TO HIS NECK BY A VILLANOUS STRAP
OTHERWISE WE SHALL ATTRACT ATTENTION TO BE STANDING HERE AND GAZING AT THEM AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT LITTLE BEAUTY AGAIN REMARKED EDWARD I'LL CONFESS EVELYN SO EVELYN AND EDWARD
PERHAPS SO SAID POLLY
ASKED MISTER KING PRESENTLY SHE IS RESTING IN THE HOTEL SAID MOTHER FISHER FAST ASLEEP I THINK BY THIS TIME YES SAID ADELA SHE IS I JUST PEEKED IN ON HER AND SHE HASN'T MOVED WHERE YOU TUCKED HER UP ON THE LOUNGE
AT THAT OLD MISTER KING WAS QUITE GONE IN DESPAIR PHRONSIE POLLY BENT OVER AND WHISPERED CLOSE TO THE WET LITTLE CHEEK DON'T YOU SEE GRANDPAPA IS FEELING BADLY I'M AFRAID HE WILL BE SICK PHRONSIE IF HE IS UNHAPPY
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LITTLE WIDOW GRAY WHO STAYED AT HOME TO LOOK OVER ADELA'S CLOTHES AND TAKE ANY LAST STITCHES GOING OFF BY THEMSELVES I DO WANT TO SEE THE VENUS DE MILO SAID POLLY QUITE GONE WITH IMPATIENCE
AND THE SUN SHINES UP THERE A GOOD DEAL AND IT'S TOO PERFECTLY LOVELY FOR ANYTHING PHRONSIE PEPPER THEN I WANT TO GO DECIDED PHRONSIE I DO SO WANT TO SEE THAT WHITE NEEDLE POLLY WELL EAT YOUR BREAKFAST SAID POLLY
IN THAT CASE MISSUS FISHER OLD MISTER KING LOOKED DOWN THE TABLE LENGTH TO MAMSIE WE MUST GO TOO FOR I DON'T INTEND TO LOSE SIGHT OF THESE NICE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS UNTIL I AM OBLIGED TO TOM'S FACE WAS ONE BIG SMILE
NO INDEED WE MUST GO IN CARRIAGES OR NOT AT ALL BUT FATHER AND JASPER'S FACE FELL DON'T YOU SEE THE UPPER DECK OF THE TRAM CAR IS SO HIGH AND THERE ARE FINE SEATS THERE
AND THE REST OF THE PARTY CROWDED UP AS CLOSE AS THEY COULD THEY ARE HER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING CLOTHES SAID MISSUS FISHER I DO BELIEVE FOR THE OLD WOMAN WAS WORKING FEARFULLY HARD TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND
THIS IS MY SEAT I ONLY LEFT IT TO SPEAK TO MY FATHER BUT THE FRENCHMAN BEING THERE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD GET STILL FURTHER INTO THE SEAT SO HE TWISTED AND EDGED BUT JASPER SLIPPED NEATLY IN AND LOOKED CALMLY UP AT HIM
AS SINCE MY MOTHER'S DEATH A DOZEN YEARS AGO HAS HAPPENED IT PAINED ME MUCH A SHADOW PASSED OVER HER BROW BUT IT WAS GONE AGAIN AND SHE SMILED AND HER EYES REGAINED THEIR OLD PLACID LOOK I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA WITH MY HUSBAND
POLLY RAN OFF A FEW STEPS AND SAT DOWN ON A LOG TO FOCUS THE MARKEN GIRLS HAPPENED TO LOOK UP AND IMMEDIATELY WHIRLED AROUND AND PRESENTED THEIR BACKS TO HER OH DEAR HOW HATEFUL SHE EXCLAIMED
THERE ARE MY FATHER AND MY TWO DAUGHTERS AND MY OTHER BOYS IN ENGLAND
OR ANY OF OUR HOME FRIENDS IT'S MISSUS SELWYN SHE HAD CONFIDED TO THE LITTLE DOCTOR JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE SHE HASN'T ANY NONSENSE ABOUT HER IF SHE IS AN EARL'S DAUGHTER EARL'S DAUGHTER SNIFFED THE LITTLE DOCTOR
CATCHING HER BREATH AND STANDING QUITE STILL AS SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE WONDERFUL MARBLE INSTINCT WITH LIFE AT THE END OF THE LONG CORRIDOR BELOW STAIRS WHY SHE'S SMILING AT US
DO LET US SIT UP TOP WE'LL DO IT NOW POLLY WHISPERED JASPER IN A TRANSPORT WHEN PHRONSIE LOOKS LIKE THAT SEE HER FACE DO YOU REALLY WANT TO GO IN A DIRTY OLD TRAM CAR PHRONSIE INSTEAD OF IN A CARRIAGE
TO COME OUT OF IT BRIGHT AND SMILING AND NOW IT HAS MADE TWO PEOPLE HAPPY PHRONSIE POLLY HAD SAID WHEN THE PRESENTATION WAS WELL OVER AND SHE ENDED UP WITH A KISS IT MADE ME HAPPY IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT OF ME AND THEN
NEVER MIND SAID JASPER LOOKING OVER HIS ARMFUL OF PRESENTS TO INVESTIGATE HIS PAPER OF GRAPES IF WE DON'T LOSE BUT ONE WE'RE LUCKY
OH ADELA THESE PAINTINGS WILL WAIT WELL THAT OLD STATUE WILL WAIT TOO CRIED ADELA PULLING HER OFF INTO ANOTHER GALLERY NOW POLLY MADEMOISELLE SAYS IN POINT OF ART THE PICTURES IN HERE ARE QUITE IMPORTANT
AND THOSE EMBROIDERED JACKETS OVER THEIR WAISTS AND THOSE CAPS AND HORRIBLE POT HOOKS AND LONG CURLS IT'S WELL THAT WE'VE GOT SO MANY PICTURES FOR THE PEOPLE AT HOME WOULD NEVER BELIEVE OUR STORIES WITHOUT THEM
WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL WITH THE FLYING FOOTSTEPS HOVE IN SIGHT IT WAS JASPER
AS OF COURSE WAS NATURAL FOR HE IS THE ELDEST AND THOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT BELIEVE IT MISSUS FISHER MY FATHER WAS ALWAYS PASSIONATELY FOND OF THE BOY I DO BELIEVE IT SAID MOTHER FISHER QUIETLY AND SHE PUT HER HAND OVER THE FOLDED ONES
POLLY HAD A CHINA WINDMILL AND AN INKSTAND OF DELFT WARE AND SEVERAL OTHER THINGS AND JASPER CARRIED ALL THE BIG BUNDLES O DEAR ME SAID POLLY NOW WE MUST RUN OR WE SHA'N'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO STAY ON THE BEACH
WE SHALL SEE IT AFTER DINNER CHILD AND PHRONSIE SMILED WELL CONTENTED BUT WHEN SHE REACHED THE CORNER GRAT STATION AND TOOK GRANDPAPA'S HAND AND BEGAN TO ASCEND THE BRIDLE PATH TO THE HOTEL SHE COULDN'T CONTAIN HERSELF AND SCREAMED RIGHT OUT
WHY THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I SPECIALLY WANTED TO SEE YES SO DID I SAID POLLY
HE WOULD REPLY TO ALL REMONSTRANCE AND DON'T ASK ME TO PUT MY HEAD INTO A CATHEDRAL OR A MUSEUM TO MISTER KING LAND ALIVE MAN I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT HOW TO TAKE CARE OF LIVING BODIES BEFORE I STARE AT BONES AND RELICS
WHEN THE PARSON RUNNING AS HE HADN'T RUN FOR YEARS APPEARED TO THEIR VIEW AND AFTER HIM AT SUCH A GAIT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS FORTUNE IN A PROFESSIONAL WAY WAS THE LITTLE DOCTOR HIS HAT WAS GONE
TO BE SURE SAID JASPER WELL WE MUST GIVE HER SOME AND THAT'S A FACT THE SMALL GIRL KEPT ON AT A DOG TROT ALONG THE BANK HER EYES FIXED ON THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO TOSSED OUT SUCH MAGIC WEALTH
WHICH CAUSED HER TO LIFT HER HEAD THE CARRIAGES ARE ORDERED SO AS SOON AS WE ARE THROUGH BREAKFAST WE WILL BE OFF OH FATHER EXCLAIMED JASPER IN DISMAY MUST WE GO IN CARRIAGES HOW ELSE WOULD YOU GO JASPER ASKED HIS FATHER
THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO KICK UP THEIR HEELS AND UNSETTLE THAT HEAVY PARTY O DEAR ME EXCLAIMED PHRONSIE IN GREAT DISTRESS THAT WOULD HURT THE POOR WOMAN TOM WELL IT SHOWS THAT THE DONKEY LIKES IT SAID TOM WITH A LAUGH BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KICK UP HIS HEELS
AND ONE TWO THREE CLINKING COINS FELL SAFELY INTO IT BUT THE BOYS RACING ALONG IN ADVANCE SOON DISCOVERED THIS SUCCESSFUL TRICK AND COMPLETELY SWARMED AROUND HER HOWLING DREADFULLY SO SHE HASTENED OFF
WHEN THE BOAT WAS NEARING THE ISLAND OF MARKEN THE LITTLE YELLOW CHEESE HAD BEEN PRESENTED WITH ALL DUE FORMALITY TO ONE OF THE SAILORS WHO HAD BEEN SPECIALLY KIND IN THE MATTER OF SECURING GOOD SEATS FOR MISTER KING'S PARTY POLLY AND PHRONSIE HAVING HELD A WHISPERED CONFERENCE IN A RETIRED NOOK
AT SCHOOL IN PARIS AND THEY ARE QUITE NICE OH I MEAN YOU'LL HAVE TO PUT ON COARSE WOOLLEN ONES THAT THE PEASANT WOMEN KNIT ON PURPOSE WE ALL SHALL HAVE TO DO THE SAME ON OVER OUR SHOES EXPLAINED JASPER
OH SOME GRAPES PLEASE JASPER SAID POLLY
AND HOLDING OUT HER ARMS AND SINGING HER SHRILL SONG BUT WHEN THE MONEY WAS THROWN SHE WAS ALWAYS A BIT TOO LATE AND THE OTHER CHILDREN SCRAMBLING AND SCUFFLING HAD POUNCED UPON IT AND HAD MADE OFF WITH IT HERE YOU BOYS KEEP AWAY YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH
THAT'S ELEGANT ONLY MADEMOISELLE WON'T TAKE US THERE VERY OFTEN I WISH I WAS RICH AND I'D HAVE A SPAN OF LONG TAILED GREY HORSES AND DRIVE UP AND DOWN THERE EVERY DAY POLLY LAUGHED WELL
I AM GOING FOR THERE IS A MARINE HOSPITAL FOR CHILDREN THERE THAT I WOULDN'T MISS FOR THE WORLD
AND HAS IT A LITTLE WHITE TENT ON THE SIDE JUST LIKE MY MOUNTAIN HERE ASKED PHRONSIE HOLDING POLLY'S ARM AS SHE TURNED OFF TO CATCH THE CHATTER OF THE OTHERS OH I SUPPOSE SO ANSWERED POLLY CARELESSLY
TO FIND THAT HIS PLAN WASN'T PRODUCTIVE OF MUCH HAPPINESS AFTER ALL HE HAD JUST OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SAY AUTHORITATIVELY
THEN SHE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT ADELA YOU MAY FIRST SHE SAID NO I'M NOT GOING TO DECLARED ADELA YES YES SAID POLLY I'D RATHER YOU DID FIRST I TRULY HAD ADELA
AND AS EVERYBODY HAD REGAINED COMPOSURE HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL VERY HAPPY HIMSELF AS THE CAR RUMBLED OFF THIS IS FINE HE KEPT SAYING TO HIMSELF THE BOY KNEW WHAT WAS BEST
LOOKING DOWN INTO HER TROUBLED LITTLE FACE WHERE HE SAT ON THE PIAZZA RAILING SWINGING HIS LONG LEGS THEY LIKE IT THOSE DONKEYS DO DO THEY ASKED PHRONSIE DOUBTFULLY YES INDEED SAID TOM WITH A GUSTO AS IF HE WISHED HE WERE A DONKEY AND IN JUST THAT VERY SPOT
CRIED JASPER COME POLLY AND PHRONSIE LET US TOSS THEM SOME WHIZ SPIN WENT THE COINS TO FALL INTO THE THICK STUBBY GRASS ON THE BANK
NOW RUN OFF WITH YOU YOU'VE PLANNED IT WELL SO JASPER MADE HAPPY FOR THE DAY RUSHED BACK TO HIS SEAT A HAND NOT OVER CLEAN WAS LAID ON IT AND A TALL INDIVIDUAL
UNLESS THEY GET A CHANCE TO LET THEM TO SOME ONE ELSE THEY NEEDN'T BE THE LOSERS NOW THEN AS JASPER BOUNDED OFF TO EXECUTE THE COMMAND GET ON YOUR BONNETS AND HATS ALL OF YOU AND WE'LL TRY THIS WONDERFUL TRAM CAR
AND AFTER THEY HAD THEIR DINNER AND WERE SCATTERED IN GROUPS IN THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE SITTING ON THE WOODEN BENCHES BY THE LONG TABLES OR TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OR WATCHING THROUGH THE BIG GLASS SOME MOUNTAIN CLIMBERS ON ONE OF THE SNOWY SPURS OF THE MATTERHORN
SAID PHRONSIE AS POLLY AND JASPER RAN UP TO A DOORWAY THROUGH WHICH THEY COULD SEE THEIR PARTY PHRONSIE STOOD JUST INSIDE AND APPEARED TO BE WATCHING FOR THEM THERE'S A WOMAN HERE WHO'S BEEN SHOWING US THINGS
THE LITTLE DOCTOR LEANED BACK IN HIS SEAT AND BEAMED AT HER OVER HIS BIG GLASSES SHE BEGAN TO LOOK RESTED AND YOUNG ALREADY THIS JOURNEY IS THE VERY THING HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF AND HIS HARD WORKED HAND SLIPPED ITSELF OVER HER TOIL WORN ONE
THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE A LITTLE TENT UP THERE A LITTLE WHITE TENT DOESN'T IT GRANDPAPA DEAR YES PHRONSIE SAID GRANDPAPA HAPPILY JUST AS HE WOULD HAVE SAID YES PHRONSIE IF SHE HAD POINTED OUT ANY OTHER OBJECT IN THE SNOWY OUTLINE
TAKE CARE POLLY YOU ALMOST STEPPED OFF BACKWARD DOWN THE BANK WARNED ADELA PULLING HER BACK AS THEY GOT OFF THE STEAMBOAT AND STOPPED A BIT TO LOOK AROUND
SIMILARLY OCCUPIED AND AT A LITTLE REMOVE WAS THE REMAINDER OF THE PARTY
I WILL ENGAGE THE ROOMS BEFORE WE GO BACK THIS AFTERNOON
OH GRANDPAPA I'D RATHER STAY HERE IT IS BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT ECHOED OLD MISTER KING FEELING TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER SINCE HE STARTED ON HIS TRAVELS WELL WELL CHILD I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT LOOKING DOWN INTO HER BEAMING LITTLE FACE
AND SO RAN ON TOM WHY WE MUSTN'T WORRY YOU AND I IF THE DONKEY DOESN'T JUST THINK HE MADE A FINE DIVERSION BY POINTING WITH HIS KNIFE BLADE UP TO THE SLENDER SPIRE OF THE MATTERHORN WE'RE GOING UP ON A LITTLE JAUNT TO MORROW
WHILE THE REST SHOUTED AS HE PICKED AT THE FERN BOX THUS HANGING TO TOM
AND HE LAUNCHED FORTH ON SO MANY AND SO VARIED DELIGHTS THAT PHRONSIE'S PLEASED LITTLE LAUGH RANG OUT AGAIN AND AGAIN BRINGING REST TO MANY A WEARIED TRAVELLER TIRED WITH THE SIGHTS SOUNDS AND SCENES OF A EUROPEAN JOURNEY
MISSUS SELWYN UNCLASPED HERS SOFT AND WHITE TO DRAW WITHIN THEM THE TOIL WORN ONE NOW THAT'S COMFORTABLE SHE SAID WITH ANOTHER LITTLE SMILE AND HERE IS WHERE HIS ECCENTRICITY BECAME THE MOST DANGEROUS TO THE PEACE OF MIND OF OUR FAMILY
SHE'S STUNNING AND NO MISTAKE MANY A CONNOISSEUR IN FEMININE LOVELINESS TURNED FOR A LAST LOOK OR PASSED AGAIN FOR THE SAME PURPOSE
WELL NOW I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT I WOULDN'T HATE A TITLE SO MUCH IF THERE WAS A GRAIN OF COMMON SENSE WENT ALONG WITH IT AND THAT MISSUS SELWYN JUST SAVES THE WHOLE LOT OF ENGLISH NOBILITY AND MAKES EM WORTH SPEAKING TO IN MY OPINION
LOOKING OUT FROM THE BIG PIAZZA CROWDED WITH THE HOTEL PEOPLE OUT TO THE ROAD IN FRONT WITH EVERY IMAGINABLE TOURIST PASSING AND REPASSING DONKEYS WERE BEING DRIVEN UP EITHER LOADED DOWN TO THEIR UTMOST WITH HEAVY BAGS AND TRUNKS
TIRED BUT RADIANT AT LAST ONE MORNING GRANDPAPA SAID
ARE THEY SAID POOR POLLY LISTLESSLY YES THEY ARE SAID ADELA TWITCHING HER SLEEVE AND MADEMOISELLE BRINGS US IN THIS ROOM EVERY SINGLE TIME WE COME TO THE LOUVRE IT'S THE EARLY FRENCH SCHOOL YOU KNOW SHE BROUGHT UP GLIBLY
BUT SHE THRUST HER ARMS INTO THE SLEEVES AND PULLED IT ON AGAIN I KNOW BUT YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING SAID MISSUS FISHER AND HAVE GOTTEN ALL HEATED UP WELL IT'S PERFECTLY SPLENDID TO TRAVEL TO PLACES WHERE WE CAN RUN AND RACE SAID POLLY IN SATISFACTION
AND THEN THE ONE PLEASURE HE HAD WAS IN PICKING OUT SOMETHING FOR POLLY OH IF THE LITTLE RED LEATHER CASE HAD GONE BACK TO THE POOR OLD MAN RAN THROUGH MOTHER FISHER'S MIND
IN LEADING ME TO YOUR PARTY MAY I TELL YOU OF OURSELVES SOME TIME WHEN A GOOD OPPORTUNITY OFFERS FOR A QUIET TALK I'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER SAID MOTHER FISHER HEARTILY IF THERE IS ONE PERSON I LIKE MORE THAN ANOTHER WHO ISN'T OF OUR FAMILY
I SHOULD RATHER SAY THEY WERE DECLARED JASPER DEAR ME WHAT A BUNCH IT'S NOT AS BIG AS MINE SAID POLLY HOLDING UP HERS TO THE LIGHT YOU MADE ME TAKE THAT ONE JASPER
YES AND I TOOK A PICTURE OF THE SAUCY GIRL WHILE SHE WAS TRYING TO STOP YOURS SAID JASPER SO SHE DIDN'T DO MUCH HARM AFTER ALL OH HERE IS A SPLENDID GROUP SEE THEM STANDING BY THAT OLD TUMBLE DOWN HOUSE POLLY HE ADDED EXCITEDLY
SAID OLD MISTER KING LAUGHING HEARTILY AT THE PERFORMANCE AND THEY WOULDN'T MIND YOU IN THE LEAST IF THEY DID I SUPPOSE NOT SAID JASPER IN CHAGRIN OH THE MEAN LITTLE BEGGARS HOLD UP YOUR APRON SCREAMED POLLY TO THE LITTLE GIRL
THERE YOU GO SWINGING HER TO HIS SHOULDER NOW THEN HE GUIDED HER HAND AND AWAY SPUN THE COIN IT DID IT DID CROWED PHRONSIE FROM HER HIGH PERCH
AND MISTER KING WOULD LAUGH AND LET HIM ALONE HE'S INCORRIGIBLE THAT HUSBAND OF YOURS MISSUS FISHER HE WOULD ADD AND WE MUST JUST LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY AND MAMSIE WOULD SMILE AND EVERY NIGHT THE LITTLE DOCTOR WOULD TOME FROM HIS TRAMPS AND MEDICAL STUDY
MOURNED POLLY FOR I'M AFRAID SHE'LL KEEP AWAY FROM ME ALL THE WHILE WE'RE ON THIS ISLAND AND THEN I CAN'T GET A CHANCE TO GIVE HER MY KODAK AT ALL SHE HAD IT AT THE MODEL FARM
AND RESIGNED HIMSELF AT ONCE AND CLOSED HIS EYES INSTINCTIVELY HE WAS A MISERABLE LOOKING MAN TALL THIN AND STOOP SHOULDERED THEY SAW WHEN THEY GOT HIM ON HIS FEET UNKEMPT AND UNWASHED
THERE SAT PHRONSIE ON A GRASSY BANK A LITTLE ABOVE THEM WITH ONE OF THE FATTEST MARKEN BABIES IN HER LAP A VARIEGATED GROUP OF NATIVES WAS NEAR BY WATCHING HER INTENTLY
I KNOW ONE IS A KODAK AND THE OTHER IS A FERN BOX SAID JASPER NODDING I ACKNOWLEDGE THEY ARE DIFFERENT AND THEY ALL BURST OUT LAUGHING AGAIN WELL AT LEAST SAID TOM JOINING IN THE LAUGH YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE TOO
I DON'T LIKE PARIS TOM LET THE WORDS OUT BEFORE HE THOUGHT THAT'S JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A BOY SNIFFED ADELA OH POLLY YOU OUGHT TO SEE THE SHOPS WHEN MADEMOISELLE HAS TAKEN US INTO SOME
THEY WERE AT BREAKFAST AND EVERYBODY IN THE VICINITY TURNED AND STARED AT THEIR TABLE DON'T MIND IT POLLY SAID JASPER HER NEXT NEIGHBOUR I WANT TO DO THE SAME THING AND IT WILL DO SOME OF THOSE STARCHED AND PRIM PEOPLE GOOD TO HEAR A LITTLE ENTHUSIASM
AND PHRONSIE WAS CONTENT TO PASS HOUR AFTER HOUR THERE BY GRANDPAPA'S SIDE AND IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF PRETTY PICTURES AND STORIES IN AND ABOUT THE SNOW CLAD HEIGHTS OF THE MAJESTIC MOUNTAIN AND THE THRONG OF GAILY DRESSED PEOPLE SOJOURNING IN THE BIG HOTELS
THAT ARE MERE OUTSIDE MATTERS AND EASILY EXPLAINED IF YOU UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE OF HIS LIFE A KINDER MAN NEVER LIVED NOR A MORE REASONABLE ONE BUT IT WAS A MISFORTUNE THAT HE HAD TO BE LEFT SO MUCH ALONE
TO MORROW NOW WE'LL DROP IN AGAIN AND LOOK AT SOME OF THE PICTURES THERE IS BEAUTY ENOUGH IN THAT STATUE SAID A LADY WHO JUST PASSED THEM TO THE GENTLEMAN WITH HER TO SATISFY ANY ONE
OH MISSUS FISHER SHE DREW HER HANDS BY A SUDDEN MOVEMENT AWAY AND PUT THEM ON MOTHER FISHER'S SHOULDERS AND THEN THAT BRITISH MATRON RARELY DEMONSTRATIVE WITH HER OWN CHILDREN EVEN LEANED OVER AND KISSED POLLY'S MOTHER I CAN'T SEE WHY IT'S SO WARM UP HERE
TOM SAW THE FELLOW SLINK WITH THE MANNER OF ONE WHO KNEW THE INS AND OUTS OF THE PLACE WELL NOW GLIDING AND DUCKING LOW IN THE SPARSER GROWTH NOW MAKING A BOLD RUN AROUND SOME EXPOSED CURVE NOW DASHING INTO A DENSE PART OF THE WOOD
POLLY WAS ALREADY GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF HOLDING UP AN IMAGINARY APRON AND AT LAST THE LITTLE GIRL UNDERSTOOD BY GESTURES WHAT SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY GET INTO HER HEAD BY WORDS SO SHE PICKED UP THE SKIRT OF HER GOWN IN HER STURDY LITTLE FISTS
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THIS TO THE LITTLE GIRL JASPER SHOUTED TO THEM AS THEY THREW COIN AFTER COIN
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SPLENDID PICTURE NEVER MIND SAID JASPER YOU CAN CATCH THEM UNAWARES AND HAVE ANOTHER TRY AT THEM NOT SO GOOD AS THAT SAID POLLY SORROWFULLY WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED
YOU WOULD WANT TO STOP AT EVERY PLACE SAID POLLY FROM THE SEAT IN FRONT WITH A GAY LITTLE LAUGH AND WE NEVER SHOULD GET ON AT THAT RATE BUT THEN I AM JUST AS BAD SHE CONFESSED SO AM I CHIMED IN JASPER DEAR ME
BUT THE FRENCH PERSON COULD INTERPRET THE EXPRESSION OF THE FACE UNDER THE WHITE HAIR AND HE ACCORDINGLY LEFT A POSITION IN FRONT OF JASPER TO SIDLE UP TOWARD MISTER KING'S SEAT IN A THREATENING ATTITUDE
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE EVER SO MUCH TO DO TO DAY TO GET OFF YES I WILL DECLARED PHRONSIE ATTACKING HER COLD CHICKEN AND ROLL WITH GREAT VIGOUR IT SEEMS AS IF THE WHOLE WORLD WERE AT ZERMATT SAID THE PARSON
THROWING HERSELF DOWN ON THE ROCKS THE OTHERS ALL DOING THE SAME THING MISTER KING AND THE PARSON AND MISSUS HENDERSON FOUND THEM AND PRETTY SOON THE GROUP WAS A BIG ONE WELL WELL WE ARE ALL HERE TOGETHER NO WHERE IS MISSUS GRAY
WE'LL SEE WHAT FATHER IS GOING TO LET US DO SAID JASPER WASN'T THAT FUN SNOWBALLING JUST THINK IN JULY CRIED POLLY CRANING HER NECK TO LOOK BACK DOWN THE PATH TOWARD THE RIFFELBERG STATION DID YOU PICK UP SOME OF THAT SNOW ASKED ADELA
FOR WE ARE GETTING SO THAT WE WANT TO TAKE ROOT IN EACH PLACE YOU JUST WAIT TILL YOU GET TO ZERMATT WHISPERED POLLY TO PHRONSIE WHO UNDER COVER OF THE TALK BUZZING AROUND THE TABLE HAD CONFIDED TO HER THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE HER BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN
AS IT LAY ON HER LAP SHE TURNED TO HIM WITH A SMILE ADONIRAM I NEVER IMAGINED ANYTHING LIKE THIS SHE SAID SIMPLY NO MORE DID I HE ANSWERED THAT'S THE GOOD OF OUR COMING WIFE
IN THE SHAPE OF A PARTNER WHO COULD TELL AND REALISING IF HE CAUGHT THE MAN AT ALL HE MUST DO ONE OF HIS SPRINTS HE COVERED THE GROUND BY A SERIES OF FLYING LEAPS DASHED IN WHERE HE SAW HIS PREY RUSH
THEY STOPPED AT THE TOP OF THE STONE STAIRWAY LEADING DOWN TO THE SANDS WHERE SOME COMELY PEASANT WOMEN FISHERMEN'S WIVES
TO LOOK INTO THAT FELLOW'S FACE PHRONSIE GOT OUT OF HER CHAIR TO COME AND STAND BY HIS SIDE I LIKE THAT WHITE NEEDLE SHE SAID WITH A GLEEFUL SMILE POLLY SAID IT WAS NICE AND I LIKE IT I SHOULD SAY IT WAS DECLARED TOM WITH A BOB OF HIS HEAD PHRONSIE
THE FRENCHMAN UNABLE TO GET HIS BALANCE SAT DOWN IN JASPER'S LAP BUT HE BOUNDED UP AGAIN BLUE WITH RAGE WHAT'S ALL THIS DEMANDED MISTER KING WHO NEVER COULD SPEAK FRENCH IN A HURRY
AH THE PLACID LOOK CAME BACK AS QUICKLY THAT IS MY ONLY COMFORT THAT YOU DID FOR FATHER TOLD THE WHOLE NOT SPARING HIMSELF NOW HE SEES THINGS IN THE RIGHT LIGHT HE SAYS BECAUSE YOUR YOUNG PEOPLE TAUGHT IT TO HIM
HE HAD AN EXHILARATION ALREADY THAT MADE HIM FEEL ALMOST AS YOUNG AS POLLY AND JASPER SCAMPERING UP THE CIRCULAR STAIRWAY AT THE OTHER END WELL BLESS ME WE ARE UP AREN'T WE HE EXCLAIMED SITTING DOWN AND CASTING A GLANCE AROUND
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA SAID JASPER WHY DIDN'T WE THINK OF IT BEFORE SHE WON'T UNDERSTAND ANY BETTER THAN THE BOYS SAID OLD MISTER KING YOU FORGET CHILDREN THAT THESE YOUNGSTERS DON'T KNOW OUR LANGUAGE
O DEAR ME CRIED ADELA IN DISMAY AND I THINK WE SHALL SLIP AND SLIDE A GREAT DEAL WORSE WITH THOSE THINGS TIED ON OUR FEET THAN TO GO WITHOUT ANY SAID POLLY WRINKLING UP HER BROWS AT THE IDEA
DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING SO FASCINATING CRIED POLLY PEPPER CLASPING HER HANDS IN DELIGHT AND NOT STOPPING TO SIT DOWN BUT LOOKING ALL AROUND YOU HAD BETTER SIT DOWN ADVISED MOTHER FISHER
WELL MAYBE HE HAS SOME WE'LL THINK SO ANYWAY POLLY ANSWERED OH SEE JASPER IS CALLING US TO BE SURE THERE HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOAT NEAREST MARKEN
ARE PERFECTLY LOVELY CRIED POLLY FEELING AS IF SHE MUST GET AWAY FROM THE BONNETS AND CLOTHES YES
FOR HAVING THAT CHILD AS COMPANY AND THOSE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE YOU SAY THE TRUTH REPLIED OLD MISTER KING CORDIALLY FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY HEART I PITY ANY ONE WHO HASN'T SOME CHILDREN TO TAKE ALONG WHEN GOING ABROAD BUT THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE LITTLE PEPPERS HE ADDED
WHERE MY DUTY IS PUTTING THE BOYS AS FAST AS THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH AND THE LITTLE GIRLS AS WELL INTO ENGLISH SCHOOLS BUT TOM HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH MY FATHER AT THE VACATIONS
AND BESIDES GRANDPAPA WILL WORRY OVER US IF WE'RE NOT THERE WE CAN'T RUN MUCH LOADED DOWN WITH THIS SAID JASPER LOOKING AT HIS ARMFUL AND LAUGHING
ONE MORE LEAP WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND I HAVE YOU CRIED TOM THE MAN UNDER HIM THROWN TO THE GROUND BY THE SUDDENNESS OF TOM'S LEAP ON HIM WAS WRIGGLING AND SQUIRMING WITH ALL THE DESPERATION OF A TRAPPED CREATURE
SO IT DID PET WELL NOW HERE IS ANOTHER THERE'S A LITTLE GIRL BACK THERE AND SHE HASN'T ANY MOURNED PHRONSIE
WITH A SLY LOOK AT JASPER BUT ANYTHING LIKE THIS MIGHT NOT HAPPEN AGAIN IN A HUNDRED TIMES FATHER SAID JASPER I SUPPOSE I MUST SAY YES I KNOW IT TO THAT SAID HIS FATHER
CONTINUED POLLY SQUINTING UP AT A CROOKED ROW ALL COLOURS GREEN STRIPES AND BLACK STRIPES AND O DEAR ME JASPER KING JUST LOOK AT PHRONSIE JASPER FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION OF POLLY'S FINGER
WHEN I DISCOVERED IT ON MY LAST RETURN VISIT TO MY OLD HOME MY FATHER WHO NEVER TOLERATED ANYTHING BUT RESPECT FROM ALL OF US WHO WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DESPOTIC GOVERNMENT I CAN ASSURE YOU WAS ALLOWING TOM WELL YOU WERE WITH HIM ON THE STEAMER
SO SHE WAS JUST GOING TO GET UP FROM HER LOG WHEN THE GIRLS THINKING FROM HER ATTITUDE THAT SHE HAD GIVEN UP THE IDEA OF TAKING A PICTURE OF THEM TURNED BACK TO THEIR WORK AS QUICK AS A FLASH POLLY FOCUSSED AGAIN AND WAS JUST TOUCHING THE BUTTON
AND HE WAS CRUELLY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T COME DOWN TO VISIT HIM IN HIS HOME WE COULDN'T SAID MOTHER FISHER IN A SORRY VOICE AT SEEING THE OTHER FACE I UNDERSTAND QUITE SAID TOM'S MOTHER WITH A GENTLE PRESSURE OF THE HAND SHE HELD
AND THEN HE SAW ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN THE PERSON OF THE PARSON WHO WAS JUST AS BIG AS THE DOCTOR WAS SMALL WITH ONE LOOK HE GLANCED AROUND TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY MORE SUCH SPECIMENS AT ANY RATE IT WAS TIME TO BE GOING
AND THEN DEVOTED HER WHOLE TIME AND ENERGY TO THE DISPLAY OF THE GARMENTS AND SHE EVEN LAUGHED ALOUD WHEN OLD MISTER KING PUT SOME COINS IN HER HARD HAND
HIS LONG BLACK HAIR HUNG AROUND A FACE SALLOW IN THE EXTREME AND HE SHOOK SO AS TOM AND JASPER MARCHED HIM BACK ESCORTED BY THE BODY GUARD OF THE PARSON AND THE LITTLE DOCTOR THAT THE TWO BOYS PUT THEIR HANDS UNDER HIS ARMS TO HELP HIM ALONG
FOR THERE SEEMED TO BE A VERY GENEROUS NUMBER OF THE SMALLER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY AND SAT DOWN WITH IT IN HER LAP ON THE RICKETY STEP THEN THEY ALL DREW UP STIFF AS STICKS AND DIDN'T EVEN WINK THAT'S CAPITAL SAID JASPER IN HUGE SATISFACTION
AND THERE'S A CUNNING LITTLE PLACE WHERE YOU AND I COULD CREEP INTO THE TENT SAID PHRONSIE BENDING HER NECK LIKE A MEDITATIVE BIRD AND I VERY MUCH WISH WE COULD GRANDPAPA DEAR WE'D FIND IT PRETTY COLD IN THERE SAID GRANDPAPA AND WISH WE WERE BACK HERE ON THIS NICE SEAT PHRONSIE
THEN SHE LOOKED UP AND CAUGHT MAMSIE'S EYE AND TURNED BACK QUICKLY AT ANY RATE PHRONSIE IT'S ALL PEAKED ON THE TOP OH ALMOST AS SHARP AS A NEEDLE AND IT SEEMS TO STICK RIGHT INTO THE BLUE SKY AND THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF OTHER MOUNTAINS OH AWFULLY HIGH
AND FORMED A DUTCH PERSPECTIVE PERFECTLY AWFUL ALL THESE QUEER DELIGHTFUL THINGS WERE PRESENTLY IMPRISONED IN THE TWO KODAKS JASPER LOOKED UP THERE THAT'S MY LAST PICTURE HE DECLARED AT ANY RATE FOR NOW
WHO WAS POINTING OUT THIS AND THAT TO POLLY JASPER NODDED BACK AGAIN DON'T LET HIM BOTHER YOU TO SEE EVERYTHING POLLY CALLED GRANDPAPA TAKE MY ADVICE IT'S A NUISANCE TO TRY TO COMPASS THE WHOLE PLACE ON THE FIRST VISIT
WHAT A BOTHER EXCLAIMED JASPER IT IS TO HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ANYWAY AND SHE HASN'T ANY APRON POLLY CORRECTED HER MOTHER THAT IS HER BROWN GOWN
WE'VE HAD SUCH FUN SIGHED POLLY AND SHE AND JASPER CAST THEIR BUNDLES ON THE SOFT SAND THEN SHE THREW HERSELF DOWN NEXT TO THEM AND PUSHED UP THE LITTLE BROWN RINGS FROM HER DAMP BROW JASPER SET HIS PAPER OF GRAPES IN HER LAP THEN RUSHED OFF
WHEREFORE HE LEFT HIS FEASTS AND MINIONS DEAR AND JUSTLY RULED AND DIED A SAINT IN NAME BUT WHEN HIS HASTING SPIRIT HEAVENWARD CAME A STERN VOICE CRIED
IS A VOLUME THAT COULD DO NO POSSIBLE HARM TO ANY ONE THESE POEMS DISPLAY A HEALTHY ROLLICKING G R SIMS TONE OF FEELING AN ALMOST UNBOUNDED REGARD FOR THE CONVERTED DRUNKARD
BEAUTY OF STYLE AND THEIR SOLEMN CADENCES HAVE SOMETHING OF THE GRAND MANNER ABOUT THEM THE EDITOR MISTER WILTON
IS THE DESCRIPTION OF MISTER ROBERT BUCHANAN'S GRANDEUR OF MIND THIS IS DECIDEDLY NEW DOCTOR COCKLE TELLS US THAT MULLNER'S GUILT AND THE ANCESTRESS OF GRILLPARZER ARE THE MASTERPIECES OF GERMAN FATE TRAGEDY
OR PREPARED FOR THEIR FLIGHT IN THE AUTUMN AND WHEN SNOW WAS ON THE GROUND SHE USED TO OPEN THE WINDOWS TO LET THE ROBINS HOP IN AND PICK CRUMBS ON THE BREAKFAST TABLE ON ONE OCCASION SHE WENT WITH HER FATHER ON A TOUR IN THE HIGHLANDS AND FOUND ON HER RETURN THAT A PET GOLDFINCH
AND CAVALIERE'S RAPPRESENTAZIONE PRECEDED IT BY SOME YEARS AND IT IS SOMEWHAT EXAGGERATED TO SAY THAT UNDER THE REGIME OF THE COMMONWEALTH THE NATIONAL GROWTH OF ENGLISH MUSIC RECEIVED A CHECK FROM WHICH IT NEVER AFTERWARDS RECOVERED AS IT WAS WITH CROMWELL'S AUSPICES
WAS OVERBORNE AND MANGLED CRUELLY THEN CRAWLED I TO HER FEET IN WHOSE DEAR CAUSE I MADE THIS VENTURE AND BEHOLD I SAID
THEIR SURPRISE AND PLEASURE WERE GREAT WHEN I EXPLAINED THE MATTER TO THEM THE HISTORY OF JOSEPH THEY ALL FOUND A DIFFICULTY IN REALISING THAT THIS HAD ACTUALLY OCCURRED ONE ASKED IF EGYPT EXISTED NOW AND IF PEOPLE LIVED IN IT
HAS NO ABIDING PLACE HIS OWN TO CALL IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT THE WORST WORK IS ALWAYS DONE WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS AND THAT PEOPLE ARE NEVER SO TRIVIAL AS WHEN THEY TAKE THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY
AND THE ONLY CONSOLATION THAT WE CAN OFFER TO THE TIMID AND THE TORIES IS THAT AS LONG AS SO MUCH STRENGTH IS EMPLOYED IN BLOWING THE TRUMPET THE SWORD SO FAR AS MISS NESBIT IS CONCERNED WILL PROBABLY REMAIN SHEATHED
THE PRETTIEST THING IN THE WHOLE VOLUME IS THIS LITTLE LYRIC ON SPRING SUCH BLUE OF SKY SO PALELY FAIR SUCH GLOW OF EARTH SUCH LUCID AIR SUCH PURPLE ON THE MOUNTAIN LINES SUCH DEEP NEW VERDURE IN THE PINES
PART OF IT LIKE ROUGH MATERIAL FOR POETRY AND PART OF IT LIKE MISSHAPEN PROSE IT IS AN INTERESTING SPECIMEN OF POETIC WRITING BUT IT IS NOT A PERFECT WORK OF ART
WOMEN MUST WEEP BY PROFESSOR F HARALD WILLIAMS SWAN SONNENSCHEIN AND CO
HOWEVER IT IS ONLY FAIR TO ADD THAT LADY BELLAIRS RECOGNISES THE IMPORTANCE OF SELF DEVELOPMENT QUITE AS MUCH AS THE IMPORTANCE OF SELF DENIAL AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF SOUND SENSE IN EVERYTHING THAT SHE SAYS ABOUT THE GRADUAL GROWTH AND FORMATION OF CHARACTER INDEED
BUT THE STORY SEEMS TO ME TO BE FAR TOO CHARMING TO REQUIRE ANY MORAL OF THE KIND BOUND UP IN THE SAME VOLUME IS A LIFE OF MISS MARY CARPENTER ALSO WRITTEN BY PHYLLIS BROWNE MISS CARPENTER DOES NOT SEEM TO ME TO HAVE THE CHARM AND FASCINATION OF MISSUS SOMERVILLE
JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE TO THAT STRANGE PLAY ON THE SAME SUBJECT WHICH MISTER SWINBURNE SO MUCH ADMIRES INDEED IT MAY BE SAID TO POSSESS ALL THE FATAL ORIGINALITY OF INEXPERIENCE HOWEVER
A VERY AMUSING CIRCUMSTANCE IN CONNECTION WITH MISSUS SOMERVILLE'S ACQUAINTANCE WITH SIR WALTER AROSE OUT OF THE CHILDISH INQUISITIVENESS OF WORONZOW GREIG MISSUS SOMERVILLE'S LITTLE BOY DURING THE TIME MISSUS SOMERVILLE WAS VISITING ABBOTSFORD
THIS IS OUR VENGEANCE DAY OUR MASTERS MADE FAT WITH OUR FASTING SHALL FALL BEFORE US LIKE CORN WHEN THE SICKLE FOR HARVEST IS STRONG OLD WRONGS SHALL GIVE MIGHT TO OUR ARM
NOR TOO ORDINARY A TYPE TO BE COMMON EXCELLENT ALSO IN ITS DIRECT SIMPLICITY OF RENDERING IS THE PICTURE OF MISS JULIET D'ARCY AND THE SCENE IN WHICH AT THE MOMENT OF HER DEATH THE OLD WOMAN'S MEMORY RETURNS TO HER IS QUITE ADMIRABLE
ARE TWO STRONG SIMPLE VERSES AND INDEED THE SPIRIT OF THE WHOLE POEM IS DIGNIFIED AND STATELY THE REST OF THE VOLUME HOWEVER IS DISAPPOINTING ORDINARY THEOLOGY HAS LONG SINCE CONVERTED ITS GOLD INTO LEAD
ON THE SUBJECT OF TIGHT LACING THE FASHIONABLE ENGLISH WAIST ALSO IS NOT MERELY FAR TOO SMALL AND CONSEQUENTLY QUITE OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE REST OF THE FIGURE BUT IT IS WORN FAR TOO LOW DOWN I USE THE EXPRESSION WORN ADVISEDLY
AND THAT LITERATURE HAD NOT YET BECOME A MOUTHPIECE FOR THE UTTERANCES OF HUMANITY MEN APPRECIATED THE ARISTOCRACY OF INTELLECT BUT WITH THE DEMOCRACY OF SUFFERING THEY HAD NO SYMPATHY THE CRY FROM THE BRICKFIELDS HAD STILL TO BE HEARD
AND EVEN THE VISIBLE ARTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO TRANSLATE INTO ANY SYMBOLS OF BEAUTY THE DISCOVERIES OF MODERN SCIENCE AT THE ARTS AND CRAFTS EXHIBITION WE FIND THE COSMOGONY OF MOSES NOT THE COSMOGONY OF DARWIN
THOUGH TO QUOTE HER OWN WORDS SHE WAS GRIEVED TO FIND THAT THE LARK WHICH AT HEAVEN'S GATE SINGS IS THOUGHT UNWORTHY OF MAN'S PROTECTION AND SHE TOOK A GREAT FANCY TO A GENTLEMAN WHO ON BEING TOLD OF THE NUMBER OF SINGING BIRDS THAT IS EATEN IN ITALY
AND THE SOUL EMERGES FROM IT STRONGER AND MORE SELF CONTAINED TO HIM CERTAINLY IT HAS BEEN A MODE OF PURIFICATION THE OPENING SONNETS
THE CHRYSANTHEMUM THE IMPERIAL FLOWER OF JAPAN HAS SUGGESTED THE TINTS OF MOST OF THE EMPRESS'S OWN GOWNS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COLOUR SCHEMES OF OTHER FLOWERS THE REST OF THE COSTUMES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED
BOTH IN CONCEPTION AND IN TREATMENT TO ME HOWEVER THE CHIEF INTEREST OF THE BOOK LIES IN THE LITTLE LIFELIKE SKETCHES OF IRISH CHARACTER WITH WHICH IT ABOUNDS MODERN REALISTIC ART HAS NOT YET PRODUCED A HAMLET
FAR AWAY WITH OUR GALLANT AND BRAVE THE LOUD WAR CRY IS SOUNDING LIKE WILD REVELRIE AND OUR HEROES DASH ON TO THEIR GRAVE FOR THE FIERCE ZULU TRIBES HAVE ARISEN IN THEIR MIGHT
THIS IS HARDLY A VERY FELICITOUS WAY OF INTRODUCING A POET NOR CAN WE SAY THAT MISTER SMITH'S POEMS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY EITHER FIRE OR CULTURE HE HAS A PLACID PLEASANT WAY OF WRITING AND INDEED HIS VERSES CANNOT DO ANY HARM
HAS OF COURSE AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTEREST BUT HAS NO ARTISTIC VALUE AT ALL INDEED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ART THE FEW LITTLE POEMS AT THE END OF THE VOLUME ARE WORTH ALL THE AMBITIOUS
HE HAS CONVERTED A CLEVER RHYMER INTO AN EARNEST AND DEEP THINKING POET THE NARROW CONFINES OF THE PRISON CELL SEEM TO SUIT THE SONNET'S SCANTY PLOT OF GROUND
MAKING A SHORT SHARP NOD WITH THE HEAD INTENDED TO DO DUTY FOR A BOW ALL NONSENSE IN THE SHAPE OF BELIEF IN DREAMS OMENS PRESENTIMENTS
WHILE ABOVE MY FROCK BANDS DREW MY SHOULDERS BACK TILL THE SHOULDER BLADES MET THEN A STEEL ROD WITH A SEMICIRCLE WHICH WENT UNDER MY CHIN WAS CLASPED TO THE STEEL BUSK IN MY STAYS
THE FIRST POEM THAT WE COME TO IS A VIGOROUS ATTACK ON THOSE WICKED AND MISGUIDED PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT BEAUTY IS ITS OWN REASON FOR EXISTING AND THAT ART SHOULD HAVE NO OTHER AIM BUT HER OWN PERFECTION
THOUGH HE REALLY SHOULD NOT PUBLISH SUCH ATTEMPTS AT METRICAL VERSIONS OF THE PSALMS AS THE FOLLOWING A SEPTUAGENARIAN WE FREQUENTLY MAY SEE AN OCTOGENARIAN IF ONE SHOULD LIVE TO BE HE IS A BURDEN TO HIMSELF WITH WEARINESS AND WOE
SHALL GROW AROUND THY DWELLING LUSCIOUS FARE OF FRUIT ON WHICH THE SUN HAS LAUGHED THIS IS THE IMMATURE MANNER OF ENDYMION WITH A VENGEANCE AND IS NOT TO BE ENCOURAGED STILL
THE ACCOUNT OF HIS MIDNIGHT RIDE TO WARN HIS ENEMY OF AN IMPENDING ATTACK OF MOONLIGHTERS IS MOST POWERFUL AND SPIRITED AND IT IS PLEASANT TO MEET IN MODERN FICTION A CHARACTER THAT HAS ALL THE FINE INCONSISTENCIES OF LIFE AND IS NEITHER TOO FANTASTIC AN EXCEPTION TO BE TRUE
PERSONALLY AND LOOKING AT THE MATTER FROM A PURELY ARTISTIC POINT OF VIEW WE PREFER MISS NESBIT'S GENTLER MOMENTS HER EYE FOR NATURE IS PECULIARLY KEEN
LORD IN THE INN OF MY POOR WORTHLESS HEART GUESTS COME AND GO BUT THERE IS ROOM FOR THEE HAS SOME MERIT AND MIGHT BE CONVERTED INTO A GOOD SONNET THE MAJORITY OF THE POEMS HOWEVER ARE QUITE WORTHLESS
DOESN'T GIVE THE BOY SIXPENCE ANOTHER BOY WAS ASKED AFTER A SUNDAY EVENING LECTURE ON THANKFULNESS WHAT PLEASURE HE ENJOYED MOST IN THE COURSE OF A YEAR HE REPLIED CANDIDLY COCK FIGHTIN MA'AM THERE'S A PIT UP BY THE BLACK BOY AS IS WORTH ANYTHINK IN BRISSEL
OF ALBANY NEW YORK IT IS A WORD BORROWED FROM THE INDIANS AND SHOULD WE THINK BE RETURNED TO THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE MOST CURIOUS POEM OF THE BOOK IS CALLED SCENES AT THE HOLY HOME
BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT CONVEY THAT SECRET TO THE READER IT IS HEAVY ABSTRACT AND PROSAIC AND SHOWS HOW INTOLERABLY DULL A MAN CAN BE WHO HAS THE BEST INTENTIONS AND THE MOST EARNEST BELIEFS
I STUDY POETRY SIMPLY AS A FINE ART BY WHICH I MAY EXERCISE MY INTELLECT AND ELEVATE MY TASTE WROTE THE LATE MISTER GEORGE MORINE MANY YEARS AGO TO A FRIEND
AND HIS VERSE IS DISTINGUISHED BY A CERTAIN REFINEMENT AND PURITY OF OUTLINE THOUGH NOT PASSIONATE HE CAN PLAY VERY PRETTILY WITH THE WORDS OF PASSION AND HIS EMOTIONS ARE QUITE HEALTHY AND QUITE HARMLESS IN EXCELSIS
THERE IS SOMETHING VERY PLEASANT IN COMING ACROSS A POET WHO CAN APOSTROPHISE BYRON AS TRANSCENDENT STAR THAT GEMS THE FIRMAMENT OF POESY AND CAN SPEAK OF LONGFELLOW AS A MIGHTY TITAN
THE WAVERLEY NOVELS WERE APPEARING AND WERE CREATING A GREAT SENSATION YET EVEN SCOTT'S INTIMATE FRIENDS DID NOT KNOW THAT HE WAS THE AUTHOR HE ENJOYED KEEPING THE AFFAIR A MYSTERY BUT LITTLE WORONZOW DISCOVERED WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
AND WILL BE APPRECIATED BY ALL EGYPTOLOGISTS THERE IS ALSO A CHARMING PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM ON THE PICTURES OF THE OLD MASTERS THE MELLOW RICHNESS OF WHOSE TINTS IMPART BY CONTRAST GREATER DELICACY STILL TO MODERN ART
I LAY DOWN MY LIFE'S TREASURE MY PRIDE MY GARMENTS AND MY NAME WITH MEN THE WORLD AND I HENCEFORTH SHALL BE AS TWAIN
THEY NATURALLY FALL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER AND MARRY AND FOR MANY YEARS DAVID WESTREN LEADS A PERFECTLY HAPPY LIFE SUDDENLY CALAMITY COMES UPON HIM
WHILE MY ARM CARRIES FIST OR MY FOOT BEARS A TOE TREK TREK PLY THE WHIP TOUCH THE FORE OXEN'S SKIN I'LL WARRANT WE'LL GO IT THROUGH THICK AND THROUGH THIN LOOP
ADDING SOMETHING TO ITS HORROR HOWEVER WHILE FULLY RECOGNISING THE WICKEDNESS OF PATCHING WE CANNOT BUT THINK THAT PROFESSOR HARALD WILLIAMS
AND AFTER THEM STOOD UP MIDHIR THE PROUD WHO REIGNED UPON THE HILLS OF BRI OF BRI THE LOVED OF LIATH BRI OF THE BROKEN HEART AND LAST WAS ANGUS OG ALL THESE HAD MANY VOICES BUT FOR BOV DERG WERE MOST
LORD HENRY SOMERSET HAS TOO MUCH HEART AND TOO LITTLE ART TO MAKE A GOOD POET AND SUCH ART AS HE DOES POSSESS IS DEVOID OF ALMOST EVERY INTELLECTUAL QUALITY AND ENTIRELY LACKING IN ANY INTELLECTUAL STRENGTH
WITH ITS DAINTY DANCING MEASURE ITS DELICATE AND WILFUL FANCY AND THE SHARP POIGNANT NOTE OF PASSION THAT SUDDENLY STRIKES ACROSS IT MARRING ITS LIGHT LAUGHTER AND LENDING ITS BEAUTY A TERRIBLE AND TRAGIC MEANING
TO MISTER BURNE JONES MAN IS STILL A FALLEN ANGEL NOT A GREATER APE POVERTY AND MISERY UPON THE OTHER HAND ARE TERRIBLY CONCRETE THINGS WE FIND THEIR INCARNATION EVERYWHERE
AND IS AS DEPRESSING AS IT IS DETESTABLE HOWEVER AS THE COWL DOES NOT MAKE THE MONK SO THE BINDING IN THE CASE OF THE SAVILE CLUB SCHOOL DOES NOT MAKE THE POET AND WE OPEN THE VOLUME WITHOUT PREJUDICE
AND THE AUTHOR OF AN IMPORTANT BOOK ON PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY MISSUS SOMERVILLE IS OF COURSE WELL KNOWN THE SCIENTIFIC BODIES OF EUROPE COVERED HER WITH HONOURS HER BUST STANDS IN THE HALL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND ONE OF THE WOMEN'S COLLEGES AT OXFORD BEARS HER NAME
AND WORSE POETRY HERE IS A PASSAGE FROM THE LEARNED JUDGE'S ACCOUNT OF ROMULUS POOR TATIUS BY SOME UNKNOWN HAND WAS SOON ASSASSINATED SOME SAID BY ROMULUS COMMAND I KNOW NOT
WHO BRINGS THEM BACK TO IRELAND TO CLAIM THEIR INHERITANCE FOR THEM BUT A SUDDEN STROKE OF PARALYSIS DEPRIVES HER OF HER MEMORY AND SHE FORGETS THE NAME OF THE LITTLE SCOTCH VILLAGE IN WHICH ISMAY'S INFORMAL MARRIAGE TOOK PLACE
IS AWKWARD AND UNCOUTH AND YET THE POEM IN WHICH THE EXPRESSION OCCURS HAS SOME PRETTY LINES MISTER IAN HAMILTON SHOULD PRUNE PRUNING WHETHER IN THE GARDEN OR IN THE STUDY
AND THE EXILE HAS MANY POWERFUL AND PICTURESQUE LINES MISTER DENNING SHOULD MAKE A SELECTION OF HIS POEMS AND PUBLISH THEM IN BETTER TYPE AND ON BETTER PAPER THE GET UP OF HIS VOLUME
IMPLIES ANY APPROVAL OF THE PARTICULAR FORMS THAT FASHION MAY ADOPT MISSUS CRAIK'S ARTICLE ON THE CONDITION OF THE ENGLISH STAGE WILL I FEEL SURE BE READ WITH GREAT INTEREST BY ALL WHO ARE WATCHING THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRAMATIC ART IN THIS COUNTRY
GATHERING WHATEVER IS OF SWEET AND DEAR THE WANDERING WIND HAS PASSED AWAY FROM HERE HAS PASSED TO WHERE WITHIN YOUR GARDEN WAITS THE CONCENTRATED SWEETNESS OF THE YEAR
AS IF THE BULK OF TWENTY MILLION WHALES WERE WORTH ONE PLEADING SOUL OR ALL THE LAWS THAT RULE THE LIFELESS SUNS COULD SOOTHE THE SENSE OF OUTRAGE IN A LOVING HUMAN HEART SUBLIME MAJESTIC
THE CRITICAL SPIRIT BEGINS TO MANIFEST ITSELF AND LIFE IS NOT TREATED AS A MERE SPECTACLE BUT THE LAWS OF ITS EVOLUTION AND PROGRESS ARE INVESTIGATED ALSO WE ADMIT THAT THE DESIRE TO REPRESENT LIFE AT ALL COSTS UNDER DRAMATIC CONDITIONS
TILL THE WHOLE OF EUROPE THRILLED WITH THE MARVEL AND MYSTERY OF THIS NEW LANGUAGE OF THE SOUL SOME SMALL DETAILS SHOULD PERHAPS BE NOTICED IT IS HARDLY ACCURATE FOR INSTANCE
WE HAVE OFTEN HAD OCCASION TO DIFFER FROM MISTER SYMONDS ON QUESTIONS OF DETAIL AND WE HAVE MORE THAN ONCE FELT IT OUR DUTY TO PROTEST AGAINST THE RHETORIC AND OVER EMPHASIS OF HIS STYLE BUT WE FULLY RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS WORK
VIRTUE IS NO OTHER THAN SELF INTEREST DEEPLY UNDERSTOOD
AND THE DARK BLUE SHEEN IS CHANGED TO GREEN AND THE GREEN FADES INTO GREY AND THE SLEEPERS ARE ROUSED FROM THEIR SLUMBERS
THE PICTURE SHE GIVES OF MISSUS SOMERVILLE WORKING AWAY AT HER TRANSLATION OF LAPLACE IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HER CHILDREN IS VERY CHARMING AND REMINDS ONE OF WHAT IS TOLD OF GEORGE SAND THERE IS AN AMUSING ACCOUNT OF MISSUS SOMERVILLE'S VISIT TO THE WIDOW OF THE YOUNG PRETENDER
BUT THE ANSWER THAT SATISFIED JOB DOES NOT SATISFY HIM HE FINDS NO COMFORT IN CONTEMPLATING LEVIATHAN AS IF WE LACKED REMINDING OF BRUTE FORCE AS IF WE NEVER FELT THE CLUMSY HOOF
A FEW YEARS AGO SOME OF OUR MINOR POETS TRIED TO SET SCIENCE TO MUSIC TO WRITE SONNETS ON THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST AND ODES TO NATURAL SELECTION SOCIALISM AND THE SYMPATHY WITH THOSE WHO ARE UNFIT SEEM
STILL IT IS NOT WITHOUT POWER AND CULTURED VERSE IS CERTAINLY A PLEASANTER MEDIUM FOR STORY TELLING THAN COARSE AND COMMON PROSE THE HERO OF THE POEM IS A YOUNG CLERGYMAN OF THE MUSCULAR CHRISTIAN SCHOOL
REMEMBRANCE OF WRONGS SHALL MAKE LASTING THE GRAVES WE WILL DIG FOR OUR TYRANTS WE BORE WITH TOO MUCH AND TOO LONG THE POEM FROM WHICH WE TAKE THIS STANZA IS REMARKABLY VIGOROUS
BRISTOL J W ARROWSMITH
IT CERTAINLY MUST BE ADMITTED THAT TO PATCH OR TO EXULT IN THE BASEST BLANK IS A FORM OF CONDUCT QUITE UNBEFITTING AN ARTIST THE VERY OBSCURITY AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE CHARACTER OF SUCH A CRIME
AND EDUCATION WHICH HAS BEEN SO TARDILY AND IN SOME INSTANCES SO GRUDGINGLY GRANTED TO THEM THE EMPRESS OF JAPAN HAS BEEN ORDERING A WHOLE WARDROBE OF FASHIONABLE DRESSES IN PARIS FOR HER OWN USE AND THE USE OF HER LADIES IN WAITING
AND AN UNJUST IMPRISONMENT FOR A NOBLE CAUSE STRENGTHENS AS WELL AS DEEPENS THE NATURE IN VINCULIS
THE DOOM OF THE CHILDREN OF LIR AND THE LAMENTATION FOR THE SONS OF TURANN RHYME GIVES ARCHITECTURE AS WELL AS MELODY TO SONG
AND THE REPETITION OF THE WORD STRIKES IS NOT VERY FELICITOUS BUT THE GRACE OF MOVEMENT AND DELICACY OF TOUCH ARE PLEASING THE WIND BY MISTER JAMES ROSS
NOT OF COURSE A GREAT POET BUT CERTAINLY AN ARTIST IN POETRY AND ONE TO WHOM LANGUAGE IS INDEBTED EVEN THOSE CONCEITS THAT MISTER SYMONDS FEELS BOUND TO CENSURE HAVE SOMETHING CHARMING ABOUT THEM
THE PRISON OF THE DANES IS NOT AT ALL A BAD POEM AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF ELOQUENT STRONG WRITING IN THE PASSAGE BEGINNING THE DYING STAR SONG OF THE NIGHT SINKS IN THE DAWNING DAY
YET HE WILL ALWAYS OCCUPY A PLACE IN ENGLISH LITERATURE
PSEUDO EPICS THAT MISTER TODHUNTER HAS TRIED TO CONSTRUCT OUT OF CELTIC LORE A BACCHIC DAY IS CHARMING AND THE SONNET ON THE OPEN AIR PERFORMANCE OF THE FAITHFULL SHEPHERDESSE
WHILE HER MAID LACES HER WAIST INTO A FIFTEEN INCH CIRCLE TO BEGIN WITH THE WAIST IS NOT A CIRCLE AT ALL BUT AN OVAL NOR CAN THERE BE ANY GREATER ERROR THAN TO IMAGINE THAT AN UNNATURALLY SMALL WAIST GIVES AN AIR OF GRACE OR EVEN OF SLIGHTNESS TO THE WHOLE FIGURE
WITH ANGERS AND ALARMS AND THIS SONNET HAS ALL THE STRANGE STRENGTH OF THAT DESPAIR WHICH IS BUT THE PRELUDE TO A LARGER HOPE
NOR IS THERE MUCH USE IN GIVING THEM THE RESULTS OF CULTURE UNLESS WE ALSO GIVE THEM THOSE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CULTURE CAN BE REALISED IN THESE COLD CROWDED CITIES OF THE NORTH
THE MOST AMBITIOUS POEM IN THE BOOK IS SOMEWHAT TOO ABSTRACT AND METAPHYSICAL AND SUCH LINES AS LIFT THEE O'ER THY HERE AND NOW LOOK BEYOND THINE I AND THOU
AND IT IS NO DOUBT QUITE RIGHT THAT THE SAINTS SHOULD TAKE THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY IT IS ONLY FAIR ALSO TO REMEMBER THAT HER WORK OF RESCUE AND REFORMATION WAS CARRIED ON UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTIES
CULTURE IN ITS USE OF LANGUAGE COURAGE IN ITS SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER THE MODERN APOSTLE OF WHOM MISS NADEN SINGS IS A YOUNG CLERGYMAN WHO PREACHES PANTHEISTIC SOCIALISM IN THE FREE CHURCH OF SOME PROVINCIAL MANUFACTURING TOWN CONVERTS EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE WOMAN WHOM HE LOVES
RENAISSANCE IN ITALY THE CATHOLIC REACTION IN TWO PARTS BY JOHN ADDINGTON SYMONDS
AY BUT WHEN OUR TRUST TOTTERS AND FAITH IS SHATTERED TO THE BASE GRAND WORDS WILL NOT UPREAR IT MISTER HAYES STATES THE PROBLEM OF LIFE EXTREMELY WELL BUT HIS SOLUTION IS SADLY INADEQUATE
THOU SPRANG LIKE MAGIC FROM THE SAND AS TOUCHED BY THE MAGICIAN'S WAND THOU SPRANG IS SLIGHTLY DEPRESSING AND THE SECOND LINE IS RATHER OBSCURE
AND IS KILLED IN A STREET RIOT THE STORY IS EXCEEDINGLY POWERFUL BUT SEEMS MORE SUITABLE FOR PROSE THAN FOR VERSE IT IS RIGHT THAT A POET SHOULD BE FULL OF THE SPIRIT OF HIS AGE BUT THE EXTERNAL FORMS OF MODERN LIFE ARE HARDLY AS YET EXPRESSIVE OF THAT SPIRIT
WITHIN WHAT NEW LIFE WAITS ME LITTLE EASE COLD LYING HUNGER NIGHTS OF WAKEFULNESS
AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BE AT ONCE DIDACTIC AND DELIGHTFUL BUT LADY BELLAIRS MANAGES VERY CLEVERLY TO STEER A MIDDLE COURSE BETWEEN THE CHARYBDIS OF DULNESS AND THE SCYLLA OF FLIPPANCY
MISTER FOSTER SEEMS TO BE QUITE POPULAR IN AMERICA THE CHICAGO TIMES FINDS HIS FANCIES VERY PLAYFUL AND SUNNY AND THE INDIANAPOLIS JOURNAL SPEAKS OF HIS TENDER AND APPRECIATIVE STYLE
WHERE HIS FATHER EDITED THE ZANESVILLE AURORA AND HE HAD AN UNCLE WHO WAS A SUPERIOR MAN AND EDITED THE WHEELING INTELLIGENCER HIS POEMS SEEM TO BE EXTREMELY POPULAR AND HAVE BEEN HIGHLY PRAISED
I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT MISS RAMSAY'S BRILLIANT SUCCESS AT CAMBRIDGE IS NOT DESTINED TO REMAIN AN ISOLATED INSTANCE OF WHAT WOMEN CAN DO IN INTELLECTUAL COMPETITIONS WITH MEN AT THE ROYAL UNIVERSITY IN IRELAND
BUT SUCH LINES AS THE FOLLOWING WHICH OCCUR IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGHT WITH THE BOAR I HUNG AS CLOSE AS KEEPSAKE LOCKET ON MAIDEN BREAST BUT FROM ITS SOCKET HE WRENCHED MY BRIDLE ARM
THE HABIT OF MAKING ALLOWANCES FOR THE OPINIONS FEELINGS OR PREJUDICES OF OTHERS AN ERECT CARRIAGE THAT IS A SOUND BODY A GOOD MEMORY FOR FACES AND FACTS CONNECTED WITH THEM THUS AVOIDING GIVING OFFENCE
THE CAUSTIC PENS OF ERUDITION STILL RECORD WHOSE ANCIENT CITIES OF GLITTERING MINARETS REFLECT THE GOLD OF AFRIC'S GORGEOUS SUNSETS THE CAUSTIC PENS OF ERUDITION IS QUITE DELIGHTFUL
BROKEN FIGURATIVE IN SHORT MORE POETICAL WELL HERE IS THE SPEECH OF POTIPHAR'S WIFE UNDER STRONG EMOTION
BUT WE SHOULD NOT MEASURE BY TOO HIGH A STANDARD THE UNTUTORED UTTERANCES OF ARTLESS NATURE THE OPENING LINES OF THE VENDETTA ALSO DESERVE MENTION WHEN STARS ARE GLOWING THROUGH DAY'S GLOAMING GLOW
WHO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO HESITATION IN INTERRUPTING THE PROGRESS OF THE PLAY WITH OBSERVATIONS OF THIS KIND
IS NOT ALWAYS BOTANISING AND MORALISING IN THIS RECKLESS AND IMPROPER FASHION HE HAS BETTER MOMENTS AND THOSE WHO SYMPATHISE WITH THE DUKE OF WESTMINSTER'S EFFORTS TO PROVIDE OPEN SPACES FOR THE PEOPLE
AND HER STYLE IS ALWAYS ADMIRABLE IN ITS CLEARNESS AND PRECISION MISS LEFFLER ARNIM'S STATEMENT IN A LECTURE DELIVERED RECENTLY AT SAINT SAVIOUR'S HOSPITAL THAT SHE HAD HEARD OF INSTANCES WHERE LADIES WERE SO DETERMINED NOT TO EXCEED THE FASHIONABLE MEASUREMENT
THE CONTINUAL USE OF PERIPHRASES IS UNDOUBTEDLY A GRAVE FAULT IN STYLE YET WHO BUT A PEDANT WOULD REALLY QUARREL WITH SUCH PERIPHRASES AS
AND THOSE WHO CONSIDER THAT STUPIDITY IS THE PROPER BASIS FOR THE DOMESTIC VIRTUES AND THAT INTELLECTUAL WOMEN MUST OF NECESSITY BE HELPLESS WITH THEIR HANDS CANNOT DO BETTER THAN READ PHYLLIS BROWNE'S PLEASANT LITTLE BOOK
THE YOUNG MEN WHO GO OUT AT NIGHT TO BE DRILLED BY AN IRISH AMERICAN THE FARMERS WITH THEIR WILD LAND HUNGER BIDDING SECRETLY AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR EVERY VACANT FIELD THE DISPENSARY DOCTOR WHO IS ALWAYS REGRETTING THAT HE HAS NOT GOT A TRINITY COLLEGE DEGREE
ARE EXCESSIVELY TEDIOUS BUT WHEN MISTER RODD LEAVES THE PROBLEM OF THE UNCONDITIONED TO TAKE CARE OF ITSELF AND MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THE MYSTERIES OF THE EGO AND THE NON EGO HE IS VERY PLEASANT READING INDEED
AND THE POET HAS ADMIRABLE OPPORTUNITIES OF DRAWING WEIRD AND DRAMATIC CONTRASTS BETWEEN THE PURPLE OF THE RICH AND THE RAGS OF THE POOR FROM MISS NESBIT'S BOOK COMES NOT MERELY THE VOICE OF SYMPATHY BUT ALSO THE CRY OF REVOLUTION
NAY SOMETIMES THEY EVEN DIE THEREOF A FEW DAYS AFTER MY ARRIVAL AT SCHOOL MISSUS SOMERVILLE TELLS US IN HER MEMOIRS ALTHOUGH PERFECTLY STRAIGHT AND WELL MADE I WAS ENCLOSED IN STIFF STAYS WITH A STEEL BUSK IN FRONT
SOME TIME AFTER THE BIRTH OF HER THIRD CHILD ISMAY DIED AND HER HUSBAND WHO HAD NEVER MADE HIS MARRIAGE PUBLIC NOR TAKEN ANY PAINS TO ESTABLISH THE LEGITIMACY OF HIS CHILDREN IS DROWNED WHILE YACHTING OFF THE COAST OF FRANCE

SUDDEN EXCLAMATIONS OF ANNOYANCE SURPRISE OR JOY
A HIDEOUS IDOL WHOSE FACE WAS BLACKENED WITH SOOT FROM BURNING HUMAN FLESH SUCH A SENTENCE ALSO AS
NOR DID HER SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE EVER WARP OR DULL THE TENDERNESS AND HUMANITY OF HER NATURE FOR BIRDS AND ANIMALS SHE HAD ALWAYS A GREAT LOVE WE HEAR OF HER AS A LITTLE GIRL WATCHING WITH EAGER EYES THE SWALLOWS AS THEY BUILT THEIR NESTS IN SUMMER
THIS NOTE OF REALISM IN DEALING WITH NATIONAL TYPES OF CHARACTER HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC OF IRISH FICTION FROM THE DAYS OF MISS EDGEWORTH DOWN TO OUR OWN DAYS
AND THEIR INCORRIGIBLE LAZINESS THE SHREWD SHOPKEEPER WHO IMPORTS ARMS IN FLOUR BARRELS FOR THE USE OF THE MOONLIGHTERS AND AS SOON AS HE HAS GOT RID OF THEM GIVES INFORMATION OF THEIR WHEREABOUTS TO THE POLICE
AND OTHERS SWEET AND NOT A FEW SHAMEFUL THEIR SUBJECT WAS NOT OF HIGH OR SERIOUS IMPORT THEY CONTAINED MUCH THAT WAS WILFUL AND WEAK
TO WHOM MISTER MORINE BEQUEATHED HIS MANUSCRIPTS SEEMS TO HAVE PERFORMED HIS TASK WITH GREAT TACT AND JUDGMENT AND WE HOPE THAT THIS LITTLE BOOK WILL MEET WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT IT DESERVES

REBECCA THE WITCH AND OTHER TALES BY DAVID SKAATS FOSTER G P PUTNAM'S SONS
SOME OF THE STANZAS ARE VERY GRACEFUL NOTABLY ONE BEGINNING YES LIKE A BUBBLE FILLED WITH SMOKE THE CURD WHITE MOON UPSWIMMING BROKE THE VACANCY OF SPACE
THE LIVE LIGHT STRIKES THE BROKEN TOWERS THE CROCUS BULBS BURST INTO FLOWERS THE SAP STRIKES UP THE BLACK VINE STOCK AND THE LIZARD WAKES IN THE SPLINTERED ROCK
AND AN INSCRIPTION IN GOLDEN LETTERS ON THE COVER INFORMS US THAT HIS POEMS ARE ADDRESSED TO THE RISING GENERATION WHOM HE TELLS US ELSEWHERE HE IS ANXIOUS TO INITIATE INTO THE GREAT COMPREHENSIVE TRUTH THAT
REMINDS US THAT RHETORIC HAS NOT YET LOST ITS CHARMS FOR MISTER SYMONDS STILL ON THE WHOLE THE STYLE SHOWS FAR MORE RESERVE BALANCE AND SOBRIETY THAN CAN BE FOUND IN THE EARLIER VOLUMES WHERE VIOLENT ANTITHESIS FORMS THE PREDOMINANT CHARACTERISTIC
THERE IS HARDLY ANY FORM OF TORTURE THAT HAS NOT BEEN INFLICTED ON GIRLS AND ENDURED BY WOMEN IN OBEDIENCE TO THE DICTATES OF AN UNREASONABLE AND MONSTROUS FASHION IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A REAL SPANISH FIGURE SAYS MONTAIGNE
MISTER DENNING IS NOT ALWAYS SO ANXIOUS TO REPRODUCE THE FAULTS OF HIS MASTER SOMETIMES HE WRITES WITH WONDERFUL GRACE AND CHARM SYLVIA FOR INSTANCE IS AN EXCEEDINGLY PRETTY POEM
BIRMINGHAM CORNISH BROTHERS
THEY ARE TRUTHS OF FACT NOT TRUTHS OF THE IMAGINATION AND THOUGH THEY MAY GIVE THE POET AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REALISM THEY OFTEN ROB THE POEM OF THE REALITY THAT IS SO ESSENTIAL TO IT ART HOWEVER IS A MATTER OF RESULT NOT OF THEORY AND IF THE FRUIT IS PLEASANT
TO USE THE SLANG PHRASE OF OUR YOUNG POETS IS VERY BAD INDEED AND REFLECTS NO CREDIT ON THE PRESS OF THE EDUCATION SOCIETY OF BOMBAY THE BEST POEM IN MISTER JOSEPH MC KIM'S LITTLE BOOK IS
AND HAS A STRONG OBJECTION TO PEOPLE WHO INSIST ON MAKING LONG CONFESSIONS THE IMPORTANT YOUNG CURATE FRESH FROM MAYNOOTH WHO GIVES HIMSELF MORE AIRS THAN A BISHOP AND HAS TO BE KEPT IN ORDER THE PROFESSIONAL BEGGARS WITH THEIR DEVOUT FAITH THEIR GROTESQUE HUMOUR
ARE THE FIRST AND LAST STANZAS OF MISTER TODHUNTER'S POEM THE BANSHEE TO THROW AWAY THE NATURAL GRACE OF RHYME FROM A MODERN SONG IS AS MISTER SWINBURNE ONCE REMARKED
AND EVERY COPYIST OF THE CROWD WITH HIS OWN SOUL THAT FACE ENDOWED GENTLE SEVERE MAJESTIC MEAN BUT WHICH WAS CHRIST THE NAZARENE THEN ONE WHO WATCHED THEM MADE COMPLAINT AND MARVELLED SAYING
THE DEMONS JEALOUSY ENVY HATE IN THE BREAST OF THOSE PASSED BY IT IS A CURIOUS THING THAT WHEN MINOR POETS WRITE CHORUSES TO A PLAY THEY SHOULD ALWAYS CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO ADOPT THE STYLE
THAN AS A PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED IN THESE TWO LAST VOLUMES HOWEVER HE SHOWS A CLEARER APPRECIATION OF THE OFFICE OF HISTORY THE ART OF THE PICTURESQUE CHRONICLER IS COMPLETED BY SOMETHING LIKE THE SCIENCE OF THE TRUE HISTORIAN
AND ACCURACY IS OFTEN SACRIFICED TO AN ADJECTIVE AMONGST THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS OF THE BOOK ARE THOSE ON THE INQUISITION ON SARPI THE GREAT CHAMPION OF THE SEVERANCE OF CHURCH FROM STATE AND ON GIORDANO BRUNO
AND TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE CURRANT JELLY AT A VERY CRITICAL MOMENT SHE OWED THE AFFECTION OF SOME OF HER HUSBAND'S RELATIVES WHO UP TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN RATHER PREJUDICED AGAINST HER ON THE GROUND THAT SHE WAS MERELY AN UNPRACTICAL BLUE STOCKING
AND THAT A FOND FATHER SHOULD LEARN FROM THE EXAMPLE OF THE CHESTNUT THAT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN OFTEN TURN OUT BADLY WE MUST ADMIT THAT WE HAVE NO SYMPATHY WITH THIS POINT OF VIEW AND WE STRONGLY PROTEST AGAINST THE IDEA THAT
IS MOST GRACEFULLY PHRASED AND MOST HAPPY IN CONCEPTION MISTER PEACOCK IS AN AMERICAN POET AND PROFESSOR THOMAS DANLEIGH SUPPLEE A M PH D F R S
POEMS IN THE MODERN SPIRIT WITH THE SECRET OF CONTENT
IS EXPRESSED IN SO INADEQUATE A FORM IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY MISTER CYRUS THORNTON SHOULD HAVE CALLED HIS VOLUME VOICES OF THE STREET HOWEVER
A MAZURKA OF CHOPIN IS CHARMING IN SPITE OF THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE FIFTH LINE AND SO ARE THE VERSES ON ASSISI AND THOSE ON SAN SERVOLO AT VENICE THESE LAST HAVE ALL THE BRILLIANCY OF A CLEVER PASTEL
AND CONCEIVED IN THE SPIRIT OF THE AUTHOR OF THE SCARLET LETTER THE COMBINATION IS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT THE POEM AS A PIECE OF FICTION HAS MANY ELEMENTS OF INTEREST
THE BEST OF THEM HAVE OFTEN SOME NEW BEAUTY TO SHOW US AND THOUGH THE WORST OF THEM MAY BORE YET THEY RARELY BRUTALISE POOR FOLKS LIVES FOR INSTANCE
FROM THE SONNETS WE TAKE THIS AT RANDOM NOT SPRING TOO LAVISH OF HER BUD AND LEAF BUT AUTUMN WITH SAD EYES AND BROWS AUSTERE WHEN FIELDS ARE BARE
SHE HAS ALWAYS AN EXQUISITE SENSE OF COLOUR AND SOMETIMES A MOST DELICATE EAR FOR MUSIC MANY OF HER POEMS SUCH AS THE MOAT HOUSE ABSOLUTION AND THE SINGING OF THE MAGNIFICAT ARE TRUE WORKS OF ART
THE POET'S VISION OF DEATH WHICH IS QUITE ABOVE THE AVERAGE MISSUS DOBELL INFORMS US THAT SHE HAS ALREADY PUBLISHED SIXTEEN VOLUMES OF POETRY AND THAT SHE INTENDS TO PUBLISH TWO MORE
WERE ANTHONY TROLLOPE AND GEORGE ELIOT ALIVE WHICH UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE NOT AS REGARDS THE SUBJECT OF QUACK SNUBBING YOU KNOW TO SUPPORT ME I AM SURE THEY HADN'T BEEN SLOW
FOR HIS SOPHISTICAL DEFENCE OF PHILOSOPHIC DOUBT WHICH IS ONE OF THE DULLEST BOOKS WE KNOW BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED
THE LONGEST POEM IN THE BOOK IS A MOST MASTERLY AND DRAMATIC DESCRIPTION OF THE TRAGIC LIFE OF THE IRISH PEASANT LITERATURE IS NOT MUCH INDEBTED TO MISTER BALFOUR
NOT AS A TRIBUTE TO THE DISTINGUISHED MATHEMATICIAN BUT AS A RECOGNITION OF THE EXCELLENCE OF SOME ORANGE MARMALADE WHICH THE DISTINGUISHED MATHEMATICIAN HAD PREPARED WITH HER OWN HANDS AND PRESENTED TO THE SHIPS BEFORE THEY LEFT ENGLAND
AND WRITTEN DOWN ON THE FLY LEAVES OF THE PRISONER'S PRAYER BOOK ARE FULL OF THINGS NOBLY CONCEIVED AND NOBLY UTTERED AND SHOW THAT THOUGH MISTER BALFOUR MAY ENFORCE PLAIN LIVING
A HUMBLE SOLDIER IN THE ARMY OF FAITH EXPRESSES A HOPE THAT HIS BOOK MAY INVIGORATE DEVOTIONAL FEELING ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUNG TO WHOM VERSE IS PERHAPS MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN TO THEIR ELDERS
GOD'S GARDEN BY HEARTSEASE JAMES NISBET AND CO
NO SOUND OF ME SHALL PIERCE FOR GOOD OR ILL THESE WALLS OF GRIEF NOR SHALL I HEAR THE VAIN LAUGHTER AND TEARS OF THOSE WHO LOVE ME STILL
THE SARAH BERNHARDT TEA GOWN FOR INSTANCE FIGURED IN THE PRESENT ISSUE HAS MANY GOOD POINTS ABOUT IT AND THE GIGANTIC DRESS IMPROVER DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME TO BE REALLY ESSENTIAL TO THE MODE AND THOUGH THE POSTILLION COSTUME OF THE FANCY DRESS BALL
IN SPITE OF ENDLESS INTERRUPTIONS CAUSED BY SUCH PROCEEDINGS AS SHOOTING MARBLES AT ANY OBJECT BEHIND HER WHISTLING STAMPING FIGHTING SHRIEKING OUT AMEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRAYER
IT WAS THE LAST THING WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR OF JOHN HALIFAX GENTLEMAN AND REACHED ME ONLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE HER LAMENTED DEATH THAT THE STATE OF THINGS IS SUCH AS MISSUS CRAIK DESCRIBES
AS ANY OTHER FORM OF THEOLOGICAL THOUGHT HERE IS THE OPENING OF A POEM CALLED A STREET SERMON WHICH IS AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF WHAT MUSCULAR CHRISTIANITY CAN DO IN THE SPHERE OF VERSE MAKING WHAT
WHICH IS ELABORATELY COMMONPLACE BUT THE FLIGHT OF CALLIOPE HAS MANY CHARMING PASSAGES IT IS A PITY THAT MISTER KELLY HAS INCLUDED THE POEMS WRITTEN BEFORE THE AGE OF NINETEEN YOUTH IS RARELY ORIGINAL
NOTHING COULD BE MUCH WORSE THAN THIS AND IF THE LINE WHERE FIERCE HYAENAS SEEK THEIR AWFUL FEAST IS INTENDED TO FRIGHTEN US IT ENTIRELY MISSES ITS EFFECT THE ODE IS FOLLOWED BY SOME SONNETS
IS A RATHER GUSTY ODE WRITTEN APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE SCHEME OF METRE AND NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE AS IT LACKS BOTH THE STRENGTH OF THE BLIZZARD AND THE SWEETNESS OF ZEPHYR HERE IS THE OPENING
THESE HOWEVER ARE MINOR POINTS MISTER SYMONDS IS TO BE WARMLY CONGRATULATED ON THE COMPLETION OF HIS HISTORY OF THE RENAISSANCE IN ITALY IT IS A MOST WONDERFUL MONUMENT OF LITERARY LABOUR AND ITS VALUE TO THE STUDENT OF HUMANISM CANNOT BE DOUBTED
ON THE POETRY OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY MISTER SYMONDS HAS OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL TO SAY AND ON SUCH SUBJECTS HE ALWAYS WRITES WITH EASE GRACE AND DELICACY OF PERCEPTION
NOR ARE NATURE'S SECRETS EVER DISCLOSED TO THOSE WHO APPROACH HER IN THIS SPIRIT HOWEVER THE AUTHOR OF THIS IRRITATING LITTLE VOLUME
TO THE LATTER THEY CAN HAVE NO BETTER GUIDE THAN MISTER SYMONDS WHOSE DESCRIPTION OF THE POEM IS MOST FASCINATING MARINO LIKE MANY GREATER MEN HAS SUFFERED MUCH FROM HIS DISCIPLES BUT HE HIMSELF WAS A MASTER OF GRACEFUL FANCY
TEDIOUS AS ZULEEKHA AND JOSEPH ARE THE CHORUS OF ANCIENTS IS MUCH WORSE THESE IDEAL SPECTATORS SEEM TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN UTTERING THOSE SOLEMN PLATITUDES THAT WITH THE AGED PASS FOR WISDOM
CHIEFLY BECAUSE NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER HAD THE PLUCK TO TACKLE THE MATTER THEY WERE ASHAMED TO HAVE THEIR DAUGHTER KNOW THAT SHE HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN EVEN A SMALL DECEPTION IT SEEMED SO LIKE INTRUDING INTO HER INTIMATE LIFE THERE ARE PARENTS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW
HAD RINGS ROUND HER EYES WHICH TOLD OF SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND WHY WE WERE MERE SPECTATORS WE HAD BEEN INTERESTED TO DISPUTE AND LOOK ON BUT SHE KNEW THAT SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IN THE NORTHEAST HER MAN WAS CARRYING A GUN
ALL RIGHT SAID THE TRAINED NURSE HE IS FAST ASLEEP AND SO HE WAS JUST AS WELL SAID THE DOCTOR THOUGH IT DOES NOT SPEAK SO WELL FOR THE STORY AS IT MIGHT
CERTAINLY ONE OF YOUR BEASTLY HEAD ACHES SHE UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU
DON'T LET'S TALK OF IT IN SPITE OF MYSELF I EXPECT I WENT WHITE FOR HE EXCLAIMED DARN IT I SUPPOSE I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE TOLD YOU
EVEN WHEN I BELIEVED IN YOU BECAUSE I WANTED TO AND HALF HOPED THAT ALL MY TEACHING WAS WRONG I MADE A BARGAIN WITH MYSELF I TOLD MYSELF QUITE CALMLY THAT I KNEW PERFECTLY WELL ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE FUTURE
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SPEAKING ANXIOUSLY EJACULATED I SWEAR I DON'T FOLLOW YOU SHE WENT ON AS IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY WHICH HAD TO BE SAID AS IF SHE WERE REASONING IT OUT FOR HERSELF
RIGHT THERE IN YOUR SCHOPENHAUER YOU HAVE A PRIMAL REASON THAT IS IF YOU CHOSE TO FOLLOW YOUR PHILOSOPHER TO THE EXTENT OF ACTUALLY BELIEVING THAT NATURE HAS DELIBERATELY FROM THE BEGINNING PROTECTED WOMEN AGAINST THAT SIN OF WHICH SO MUCH IS MADE
THE FLOWERBEDS TO DRESS THE DINNER TABLE IF WE WERE GOING IN TWO DAYS WHERE WAS THE GOOD OF LEAVING THE FLOWERS TO DIE ALONE
AND SHE SAILED INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING THE DOCTOR GAZING QUIZZICALLY AFTER HER BEFORE SHE WAS OUT OF HEARING HE CALLED TO HER I SAY YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT SINCE NINETY TWO
NOT ALWAYS UNHAPPY ONES I FANCY I SUPPOSE ALL MEN FLATTER THEMSELVES THAT WAY AND ARGUE THAT PROBABLY THE SABINE WOMEN PREFERRED THEIR FATE TO NO FATE AT ALL
MORE THAN ONE OF US SMILED AT HIS RESEMBLANCE TO PIERRE JANET ENTERING THE TRIBUNE AT THE COLLEGE DE FRANCE AND THE YOUNGSTER SAID UNDER HIS BREATH A CLINIQUE I SUPPOSE THE DOCTOR'S EARS WERE SHARP
PERHAPS SHATTUCK GAVE AN AMUSED LAUGH DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU KEPT ME TO THE POINT NOT EXACTLY AT THAT TIME
NO ONE DARED MEN CAN'T ROUGH HOUSE THAT KIND OF A WOMAN AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE THE CRITIC SPOKE UP YOU WERE RIGHT TO READ THAT STORY IT IS NOT THE SORT OF THING THAT LENDS ITSELF TO NARRATING
THE DOCTOR'S STORY AS ONE DREAMS THE TALE OF AN ADOLESCENT THE NEXT DAY WAS VERY PEACEFUL WE WERE BECOMING HABITUATED TO THE SITUATION IT WAS A SUNDAY AND THE WEATHER WAS WARM
AND THEN ROLLED OVER AMONG THE CUSHIONS OF THE HAMMOCK IN WHICH SHE WAS SWINGING AND BURST INTO A TORRENT OF TEARS WHEN THE PAROXYSM HAD PASSED SHE SAT UP WIPED HER EYES IN WHICH HOWEVER THERE WAS NO LAUGHTER AND SAID PASSIONATELY
ARE ELECTED TO THE TASK BY SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MERE DESIRE TO SERVE IN HER CASE THE GIFT OF HER YOUTH AND HER ILLUSIONS HAD DONE OTHERS NO REAL GOOD AND HAD MORE OR LESS
AND DREARILY STARTED UP THE HILL SHE DID NOT GO FAR HOWEVER MISS MORELAND HAD HER MISGIVINGS ON THAT POINT AND JUST AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO DRAW A BREATH OF RELIEF CONVINCED THAT AFTER ALL SHE WOULD GO THE GIRL STOPPED
NO STORY IS FINISHED UNTIL THE HEROINE IS DEAD SAID THE JOURNALIST
SEE HERE HE WHISPERED
THE YOUNGSTER PUT A STOOL UNDER HER PRETTY FEET AND THE DOCTOR SET A CUSHION BEHIND HER BACK WHILE THE JOURNALIST WITH A LAUGH POURED HER A GLASS OF WATER AND THE VIOLINIST CEREMONIOUSLY LEANED OVER AND ASKED SHALL I TURN FOR YOU SHE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING
I'D AS LIEF LIVE IN A WORLD CREATED AND RUN BY GEORGE BERNARD SHAW
LOOKING IN VAIN FOR A CAB AND WONDERING AFTER ALL WHY SHE HAD VENTURED OUT
AND MORE ADJACENT OF COURSE TEACHER'S PET NEVER HAS ANY SECRETS FROM THE TEACHER AND DOES NOT MEAN TO BE A SNEAK EITHER JUST CAN'T HELP TURNING HERSELF INSIDE OUT FOR HER IDOL
A TORRENT OF WORDS RUSHED TO THE MAN'S LIPS BUT HE WAS TOO WISE TO MAKE EXCUSES YET THERE WERE EXCUSES ANY FAIR MINDED JUDGE WOULD HAVE SAID SO BUT HE KNEW BETTER THAN TO THINK THAT FOR ONE MOMENT THEY WOULD BE EXCUSES IN THE MIND OF THIS WOMAN
SORRY TO SPOIL ANY MORE ILLUSIONS DEAR CHILD BUT HOW ABOUT THE LONG LIST OF MEN WHO ARE ANNUALLY RUINED BY IT THE MEN IN THE PRISONS THE MEN WHO KILL THEMSELVES THE MEN WHO HANG FOR IT THOSE ARE CRIMES I AM NOT TALKING OF THE CRIMINAL CLASSES
THE LITERATURE TEACHER COUNTED FOR SOMETHING IN THE AFFAIR AND I IMAGINE THAT IT WAS NEVER TALKED OVER BETWEEN THE PARENTS AND DAUGHTER WHO SOON AFTER LEFT TOWN FOR EUROPE AND FOR THREE YEARS WERE NOT SEEN IN BOSTON
WHY THE LITERATURE TEACHER WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING HER CAREFULLY HAD HER THEORY SHE KNEW A LOT ABOUT GIRLS WASN'T SHE ONCE ONE HERSELF SO IT WAS BY HER ADVICE THAT THE FAMILY DOCTOR WAS TAKEN INTO THE FAMILY CONFIDENCE
I BORE MY CHILDREN IN PEACE WITH THE DIVINE CONSOLATION OF YOUR DEVOTION ABOUT ME WHAT RIGHT HAVE I TO DENY ANOTHER WOMAN THE SAME JOY SHATTUCK SPRANG TO HIS FEET IT'S NOT TRUE HE GASPED IT'S NOT TRUE
AND CARRIED A BIG LACE BAG ON HER ARM AND AS SHE LEANED BACK IN HER CHAIR SHE PULLED ONE OF THE BIG OLD FASHIONED CANDLES IN ITS DEEP GLASS TOWARD HER AND SAID WITH A NERVOUS LAUGH
I COULD NOT BEAR TO HUMBLE YOU IN YOUR OWN EYES BY LETTING YOU SUSPECT THAT I KNEW THE TRUTH I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO DISTURB THE OUTWARD RESPECTABILITY OF YOUR LIFE BY INTERRUPTING ITS OUTWARD CALM TO BE ABSOLUTELY HONEST THOUGH I HAD LOST YOU I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO GIVE YOU UP
HE APPEARED TO BE REFLECTING AS HE LIGHTED IT AND IF HIS MIND COULD HAVE BEEN READ IT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS WONDERING HOW IT HAD HAPPENED THAT THE CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN THIS TURN
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MAN COMES OUT OF A GREAT PASSION JUST AS GOOD AS NEW WHILE A WOMAN IS SHATTERED IN A MORAL SENSE AND NEVER FULLY RECOVERS HERSELF SHATTUCK'S BACK WAS TOWARD HER WHEN HE REPLIED
THAN IT HAD BEEN TO OPPOSE HER FATHER IN THIS REALIZATION THERE WAS A TOUCH OF SELF REPROACH SHE KNEW IN HER OWN HEART THAT SHE WOULD BE GLAD TO DO NO MORE WORK OF THAT SORT EXPERIENCE HAD MADE HER HOPELESS
THE LOVE OF A MAN IN HER OWN SET BUT THE SHADOW OF TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE SAT ON HER LIKE A SHADOW OF FEAR SHE WAS IMPATIENT WITH HERSELF THE WORLD LIVING
I IMAGINE THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE ADOLESCENT FINDS IT MUCH EASIER TO CONFIDE IN SOME ONE OTHER THAN THE PARENTS WHO WOULD SEEM TO BE HER PROPER CONFIDANTS AT ANY RATE THE BANKER AND HIS WIFE WERE SIMPLY STAGGERED
AT WHICH NATURE LAUGHS YET THIS OTHER WOMAN PROUD HIGH MINDED UNSELFISH HITHERTO ABOVE REPROACH HAD GIVEN HERSELF FOR LOVE ALONE WITH EVERYTHING TO LOSE AND NOTHING TO GAIN I HAVE COME TO DOUBT MYSELF
WATCHING FOR THE DREADED OFFICER HERSELF IT WAS THE OLD STORY A DYING MOTHER NO FATHER NO ONE TO DO ANYTHING A CHILD SENT OUT TO CUNNINGLY DEFY THE LAW BUT IT SEEMED TO BE ONLY FOR BREAD
IN FACT HE FORBADE MY GOING AGAIN IS IT A REAL GERMAN VICTORY I ASKED IF IT ISN'T
OF COURSE MY HUSBAND IS A GOOD MAN IN ALL WAYS I DO HIM PERFECT JUSTICE
I LOOKED BACK AT MY MARRIAGE AND SAW THE AFFAIR AS IT REALLY WAS I HAD NOT SOLD MYSELF TO YOU EXACTLY I HAD LOVED YOU TOO MUCH TO BARGAIN IN THAT WAY NEVERTHELESS THE MARRIAGE HAD BEEN A BARGAIN IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR PROMISE TO PROTECT AND PROVIDE FOR ME TO FEED ME CLOTHE ME
HE TOOK HER LACE SCARF FROM THE BACK OF HER CHAIR AND STROLLED AFTER HER THE SCULPTOR SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WITH SUCH A DROLL EXPRESSION THAT WE ALL HAD TO SMILE THEN WE WENT INDOORS WELL SAID THE DOCTOR AS HE JOINED HER
I HOPE THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE THE LAST TWO WORDS AS IF HE HAD EXPECTED HER TO ANTICIPATE THEM WITH SOMETHING AND THERE WAS A HALF INTERROGATIVE NOTE IN HIS VOICE SHE MADE NO RESPONSE SO HE WENT ON
UNTIL HE CAME SPICK AND SPAN IN WHITE FLANNELS
WHEN THEY DID RETURN IT WAS TO ANNOUNCE THE MARRIAGE OF THE PRINCIPAL GIRL TO THE SON OF THE FAMILY LAWYER A CLEVER MAN AND A RISING POLITICIAN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LITERATURE TEACHER AND THE PRINCIPAL GIRL HAD NEVER WHOLLY BROKEN OFF
SHE SHRANK BACK WITH A SHUDDER CRYING OUT THAT HE SHOULD SPARE HER HER OWN CONTEMPT THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE HER THE POWER TO SEEK PEACE AND HER VOICE HAD SUCH A TONE OF TERROR AS SHE RECOILED FROM HIM THAT HE FELT HOW POWERLESS ANY PROTEST WOULD BE
AND WHO IS FORCED AT THE SAME TIME TO ENCOUNTER THE LAWS OF NATURE AND PAY AT THE SAME TIME THE PENALTY OF BEING A WOMAN AND THE PENALTY OF KNOWLEDGE FOR JUST SO SURELY AS WE LIVE WE MUST ENCOUNTER LOVE
AND ARE FORCED TO MAKE A REAL EFFORT TO FACE THE FUTURE TO GO ON IN FACT THE SMILE HAD DIED OUT OF SHATTUCK'S FACE AND HE SAID QUITE SERIOUSLY AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED NAOMI I HAVE VERY DIFFERENT RECOLLECTIONS OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR
I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT OF YOU BUT I DO KNOW THAT NO WOMAN WAS EVER WOOED AS HOTLY AS YOU WERE OR EVER I SWEAR IT MORE ARDENTLY DESIRED NO WOMAN EVER LED A MAN THE CHASE YOU LED ME IF EVER IN THOSE DAYS YOU WERE AS ANXIOUS FOR MY LOVE AS YOU HAVE SAID YOU WERE THIS EVENING
BUT NOT ENOUGH OF ONE TO BEAR THE THOUGHT OF HER ALONE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY WITH MIND AND EMOTIONS CLOUDED I MAY BE COWARDLY ENOUGH TO WISH THAT I HAD NEVER FOUND IT OUT I AM NOT COWARD ENOUGH TO KEEP SILENT ANY LONGER
ONLY ALAS HE IS NOT THE LOVER OF MY DREAMS MY CHILDREN ARE NICE HANDSOME BOYS
THAT IF I WENT FORWARD WITH YOU I WENT FORWARD DELIBERATELY WITH OPEN EYES KNOWING WHAT LOGICALLY I MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND IN THE FUTURE IGNORANCE THAT BLISSFUL COMFORT OF SO MANY WOMEN WAS DENIED ME STILL
FOR A SICK MOTHER A DYING MOTHER AND BEGGED AS IF NOT ACCUSTOMED TO IT ALL THE TIME WITH AN EYE FOR THAT DREAD
I'D RATHER THAT IT WERE TRUE THAT SHE HAD PICKED IT UP SOMEWHERE AS WE BEGAN TO PREPARE TO GO IN THE DOCTOR LOOKED DOWN THE PATH TO WHERE THE DIVORCEE WAS STILL STANDING
THE DOCTOR HAD KNOWN THE GIRL SINCE HE USHERED HER INTO THE WORLD IF THERE WERE ANY ONE WITH WHOM SHE HAD SHOWN THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF INTIMACY IT WAS WITH HIM LIKE ALL DOCTORS WHOSE ASSOCIATIONS ARE SO LARGELY WITH WOMEN
OLD SCEPTICS AND MODERN SCOFFERS I REMEMBER IT WELL BEFORE I WAS OUT OF MY TEENS I HAD IMBIBED A MISTRUST FOR ALL EMOTIONS PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ALL ON THE OUTSIDE THAT I HAD NONE
THE SPELL OF NATURE WAS UPON ME AND FOR A TIME I DREAMED THAT A DEPTH OF PASSIONATE LOVE LIKE MINE A LIFE OF LOYAL DEVOTION MIGHT WRAP ONE MAN ROUND AND KEEP HIM SAFE MIGHT IN FACT WORK A MIRACLE
AND SOMEBODY WILL GO RIGHT HOME WITH YOU TO SEE YOUR MOTHER TO WARM YOU YOU POOR LITTLE MITE AND FEED YOU AND MAKE YOU QUITE HAPPY SHE DID NOT EXPLAIN AND THE CHILD WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD
I HAVE HAD MY DAY FOR YEARS IT WAS AN ENVIABLE ONE NO WOMAN CAN HOPE FOR MORE WHAT RIGHT HAVE I TO STAND IN THE WAY OF ANOTHER WOMAN'S HAPPINESS A HAPPINESS NO ONE CAN VALUE BETTER THAN I WHO SO LONG WORE IT IN SECURITY
DIFFERENT AND BESIDE WHICH THE LIFE I TRY TO LEAD WITH ALL THE STRENGTH I HAVE IS NO MORE LIKE THE LIFE I DREAMED THAN MY BOYS ARE LIKE MY DREAM CHILDREN IF YOU THINK IT HAS NOT TAKEN COURAGE TO PLAY THE PART I HAVE PLAYED
IT IS HARD ENOUGH TO THINK OF LIVES GOING OUT STILL AS THE DOCTOR WAS SO FOND OF SAYING MAN IS BORN TO DIE AND WOMAN TOO BUT THAT THE GREAT WORKS OF MEN HIS BEQUEST TO THE COMING GENERATIONS SHOULD BE WANTONLY DESTROYED
ONE OF THE SORT WHO SEEMED TO DO EVERYTHING BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE AND WITH A LACK OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS OR PRETENSION EVERY ONE ADMIRED HER SOME OF HER COMRADES WOULD HAVE LOVED HER IF SHE HAD GIVEN THEM THE CHANCE
WITH SUCH A TEACHER THAN THEY EVER DO WITH THE MATHEMATICS ALSO AS ALWAYS HAPPENS THERE WAS A TEACHER'S PET ONE OF THOSE GIRLS THAT HAS TO ADORE SOMETHING AND THE LITERATURE TEACHER AS SHE WAS SMART AND GOOD LOOKING WAS AS CONVENIENT TO ADORE AS ANYTHING ELSE
BUT I SEEMED TO LACK SOME OF THE QUALITIES THAT AID TO RECONCILE OTHER WIVES TO LIFE I SEEMED TO BE WITHOUT MOTHER LOVE MY CHILDREN WERE DEAR TO ME ONLY BECAUSE THEY WERE YOURS THE MATERNAL PASSION WHICH IN SO MANY WOMEN IS THE ABSORBING EMOTION OF LIFE WAS DENIED ME
WAIT THERE A MINUTE AND MUM I'LL TELL YOU
IT MADE HIM UNQUIET IN HIS MIND WHY ALL THIS MYSTERY WHY WELL WHY A GREAT MANY THINGS FOR OF COURSE THE PRINCIPAL GIRL HAD TO PREPARE FOR THESE ABSENCES AND ALTHOUGH THE LITTLE FIBS SHE TOLD WERE HARMLESS ENOUGH WELL
DID SHE ASKED THE CRITIC OF THE DIVORCEE WHO WAS STILL NERVOUSLY ROLLING HER MANUSCRIPT IN BOTH HANDS I DON'T KNOW HOW SHOULD I AND IF I DID I SHOULDN'T TELL YOU IT ISN'T A TRUE STORY OF COURSE
SHARE YOUR FORTUNE WITH ME AND GIVE ME YOUR NAME I HAD GIVEN YOU MYSELF
ALL THAT SHE HAD BEEN IN HER LOYALTY HER NOBILITY WAS SO MUCH A PART OF THIS MAN'S LIFE WHAT COMPARED TO THAT WERE PETTY SINS OR BIG ONES HE SAW THE PAST AS A DROWNING MAN SEES THE PANORAMA OF HIS EXISTENCE
MY FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO BE DONE WITH LIFE BUT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO THAT MUCH AS I DESIRED IT IT WOULD HAVE LEFT YOU SUCH A WRETCHED MEMORY OF ME YOU COULD NEVER HAVE PARDONED ME THE SCANDAL AND I FELT THAT I HAD AT LEAST THE RIGHT TO LEAVE YOU A DECENT RECOLLECTION OF ME
SINGULARLY ENOUGH AS I GREW CALM I GREW TO RESPECT THIS OTHER WOMAN I COULD NOT BLAME HER FOR LOVING YOU I ENDED BY ADMIRING HER I HAD KNOWN HER SO WELL SHE WAS SUCH A PROUD WOMAN
REPENTING THEIR SINS AND PRAYING FOR BLESSINGS ON THE FUTURE IN THEORY BUT IN REALITY FUSSING THEMSELVES ILL OVER BELATED FINERY SHE HAD HAD FOR SOME YEARS A NUMBER OF POOR PROTEGEES IN THE LOWER END OF THE CITY
THE DEAR LITTLE JOSEPHINE AND I STILL THINK THAT IS THE BANNER STORY ME TOO SAID THE DOCTOR AS WE WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF I CAN TELL A THIRD PHASE
I THOUGHT I HAD MADE HER SO REASONABLE JUST WHAT ALL WOMEN OUGHT TO BE AND WHAT NONE OF US ARE
THAT LIFE IS VERY UNFAIR TO WOMEN WELL I DON'T SEE THAT
IT IS THE GLORY THAT GILDS OUR FACTS IT IS THE BRILLIANT BARRIER WHICH SEPARATES US FROM THE BEASTS AND THE ONLY REAL THING THAT DIVIDES US INTO CLASSES THOUGH OF COURSE
YOU MIGHT TAKE IT OUT INTERRUPTED THE HUSBAND IN FEELING FLATTERED THAT IT TAKES SO MUCH TO CONQUER SUCH AS YOU SO WE MIGHT BUT THAT ONCE CONQUERED NEITHER MAN NOR NATURE HAS ANY FURTHER USE FOR US AND REGRET LIKE ART IS LONG
MISSUS SHATTUCK EXAMINED HER DAINTILY POLISHED NAILS RUBBED THEM CAREFULLY ON THE PALM OF HER HAND AS WOMEN HAVE A TRICK OF DOING
THE THINGS ONE DOES NOT SAYS EVEN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF OUR ENGAGEMENT I KNEW THAT I WAS NOT AS ESSENTIAL TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME LIFE HELD OTHER INTERESTS FOR YOU EVEN THE FLATTERY OF OTHER WOMEN STILL HAD ITS CHARM FOR YOU
I KNOW THAT THIS IS VERY SHOCKING I HAVE BECOME USED TO IT AND IT IS THE TRUTH I HAVE NOT BLAMED YOU I COULD NOT AND BE REASONABLE NO MAN CAN BE OTHER THAN NATURE PLANS OR PERMITS BUT HOW I HAVE PITIED MYSELF
THE TRAGIC WHEN MY TURN COMES
AND THERE ARE SOME EVEN AMONG WOMEN WHO MUST KNOW THE TRUTH AND ABIDE BY IT WELL THANK HEAVEN SAID THE MAN PULLING AT HIS CIGAR THAT MOST WOMEN ARE MORE EMOTIONAL THAN INTELLIGENT AS NATURE MEANT THEM TO BE
IN TEN YEARS I DOUBT IF YOU HAVE EVER MADE SO FRANK A DECLARATION AS THAT IN WORDS HE WAS WONDERING IF AFTER ALL SHE WERE GOING TO DEVELOP INTO AN EMOTIONAL WOMAN
AS I FELT I MUST IF I LET ANY ONE DISCOVER MOST OF ALL YOU WHAT I KNEW SO LIKE A COWARD I LIVED ON BECOMING GRADUALLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE IDEA THAT MY DAY WAS PAST BUT KNOWING THAT THE MOMENT I WAS FORCED TO SPEAK
OF COURSE YOU MIGHT HAVE ACTED IT OUT BUT YOU WERE WISE NOT TO I CAN'T HELP IT GOT TO SAY IT SAID THE JOURNALIST WHAT A HORRID WOMAN THE DIVORCEE LOOKED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT
AND SHE ROSE FROM HER CHAIR AND WALKED AWAY INTO THE MOONLIGHT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY EJACULATED THE VIOLINIST WHO ADMIRED HER TREMENDOUSLY THAT SHE MADE THAT UP IN THE IMAGINATION SHE CARRIES AROUND UNDER THAT PRETTY FLUFFY HAIR
BY JOVE IS THE STORY OF THE PRINCIPAL GIRL ALL TOLD THAT'S A SHAME
I'M NOT AN AUTHOR AND I AM GOING TO BED
AND SHE WAS JUST CONVENTIONAL ENOUGH IN SPITE OF HER POSE TO THE EXACT CONTRARY TO HOPE THAT NONE OF HER FRIENDS WOULD PASS SHE KNEW HER SET WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT IT WOULD CAUSE SOMETHING ALMOST LIKE A SCANDAL IF SHE WERE SEEN OUT ALONE ON FOOT ON THE VERY EVE OF HER WEDDING DAY
MISSUS SHATTUCK SEEMED TO BE THINKING AS HE PASSED HER HE STOPPED PICKED UP HER CUSHIONS AND RE ARRANGED THEM ABOUT HER WITH AN IDLE CARESS BY THE WAY A KISS GENTLY DROPPED ON THE INSIDE OF HER WHITE WRIST
AS THEY HURRIED ALONG IT WAS IN FRONT OF A DARK HOUSE THAT THEY FINALLY STOPPED AND WENT UP THE STONE STEPS INTO A HALL SO DARK THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE THE CHILD'S DIRTY COLD HANDS IN HERS TO BE SURE OF THE WAY
AND IF BETWEEN TWO RIDICULOUS POSITIONS MARRIAGE HAVING BEEN PUSHED NEAREST HAD NOT BECOME DESPERATELY INEVITABLE
GIVES THAT SAME PERMISSION TO ALMOST ANY ONE WHO ASKS FOR IT NAOMI HE GROANED FROM HIS COVERED MOUTH WHAT GHASTLY PHILOSOPHY ISN'T THAT THE MARRIAGE LAW HOW MUCH BETTER AM I AFTER ALL THAN THE POOR GIRL IN THE STREET
THOUGH THEY ARE A BIT DISCONCERTING TO ME AS A HUSBAND I SUPPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT IS LOGICAL ENOUGH YOU WERE ALWAYS EVEN AS A GIRL INCLINED TO MAKING FOOTNOTES I SUPPOSE THEIR PRESENT DARING IS SIMPLY THE RESULT OF OUR BEING JUST A LITTLE OLDER THAN WE USED TO BE
TO PUT OUT OF HER MIND THERE SEEMED BUT ONE THING TO DO GO WITH THE CHILD SHE KNEW THAT IF SHE DID NOT SHE WOULD NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT NOR SMILE THE NEXT DAY
NONE OF YOU SEEM TO REALLY LIKE ANY STORY BUT YOUR OWN AND I MUST CONFESS THAT AMONG US WE ARE PUTTING FORTH A STRANGE BAGGAGE ON THE CONTRARY SAID THE CRITIC
BUT LIKE THE LINES OF MEAN TEMPERATURE THE TRUTH IS SAID THE LAWYER IF THE PRINCIPAL GIRL HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO STRUGGLE FOR HER LIVING THE FACT THAT HER IMAGINATION DID NOT RUN AT ANY POINT INTO HER WORLD OF REALITIES
BUT IT DID NOT MAKE HER ANY THE LESS NERVOUS OR HER VOICE ANY THE LESS SHAKY AS SHE BEGAN IT WAS AFTER DINNER ON ONE OF THOSE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN THEY DINED ALONE TOGETHER THEY WERE TAKING COFFEE IN MISSUS SHATTUCK'S ESPECIAL CORNER OF THE DRAWING ROOM
THEY SOMETIMES DO IN THE BEST REGULATED FAMILIES IT WAS DECIDED TO PUT A DISCREET PERSON ON THE JOB AND DISCOVER FIRST OF ALL WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON
HE WAS FACING HER ASTRIDE HIS CHAIR IN A POSITION MAN HAS LOVED SINCE CREATION HE WAS JUST THINKING THAT HIS WIFE HAD NEVER LOOKED HANDSOMER FINER IN FACT IN ALL HER LIFE QUITE THE SATISFACTORY ALL ROUND DESIRABLE SORT OF A WOMAN
I THINK IT A HORRID STORY AND I THINK INTERRUPTED THE DOCTOR THAT YOU HAVE A VICIOUS MIND AND HERE THE DOCTOR CAST A QUICK LOOK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE YOUNGSTER WHO WAS STRETCHED OUT IN A STEAMER CHAIR AND HAD NOT SAID A WORD
NO ONE WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT LEAST OF ALL I MY REASON HAD ALREADY TAUGHT ME THAT MINE WAS BUT THE COMMON FATE OF ALL WOMEN THAT LIFE WAS DEMANDING OF ME THE USUAL TRIBUTE TO POSTERITY THAT THE SWEETNESS OF THE EMOTION WAS NATURE'S TRICK TO MAKE IT ENDURABLE
SHE SAID PETTISHLY IT SERVES ME QUITE RIGHT NOW I SUPPOSE THEY'VE GOT ALL SORTS OF QUEER NOTIONS IN THEIR HEADS NONSENSE SAID THE DOCTOR ALL AUTHORS YOU KNOW RUN THE RISK OF GETTING MIXED UP IN THEIR ROMANCES THINK OF CHARLOTTE BRONTE
THAT HE WOULD NEVER DESERT HIS WIFE FOR HER HAD HE NOT BETRAYED HER OF WHAT USE TO TELL HER HOW HE HAD REPENTED HIS FOLLY THAT HE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT HIMSELF THERE WERE THE FACTS AND NATURE AND HIS WIFE'S PHILOSOPHY AGAINST HIM
WE CAME INTO THIS WORLD LIKE BEASTS WHY AREN'T WE CONTENT TO LIVE LIKE BEASTS AND MAKE NO PRETENSES WOMEN WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO EXPECT THEN AND THERE'D BE NO SUCH THING AS BROKEN HEARTS IN SPITE OF ALL THE POLISH OF CIVILIZATION MAN IS SIMPLY BENT ON CONQUEST
FOR SOME REASON SHATTUCK SEEMED TO FIND THE CIGAR HE WAS SMOKING MOST UNSATISFACTORY EITHER IT HAD BEEN BROKEN OR HE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY CHEWED THE END A THING WHICH HE DETESTED AND THERE WAS A PAUSE WHILE HE DISCARDED THE WEED AND SELECTED A FRESH ONE
NOT A BIT HE ANSWERED RUNNING HIS KEEN BROWN EYES OVER US TO BE SURE WE WERE LISTENING BEFORE HE BEGAN
A WOMAN SCALES THE HEIGHTS BUT ONCE HENCE IT MUST DEPEND IN THE CASE OF WOMEN CAPABLE OF DEEP LOVE ON THE MEN WHETHER THE RELATION INTO WHICH MARRIAGE BETRAYS THEM BE DECENT OR INDECENT WHAT I SHOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DISCOVER IS WHAT PROVISION DOES EITHER MAN
I AM SORRY FOR YOUR LACK OF INSIGHT AND SHE GOT UP AND WALKED AWAY
WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO VISIT ON WORK OF A CHARITABLE NATURE BEGUN WHEN SHE WAS A SCHOOL GIRL SHE HAD FOUND WORK ENOUGH TO DO THERE EVER SINCE IT WAS WORK OF WHICH HER FATHER A HARD HEADED MAN OF BUSINESS STRONGLY DISAPPROVED ALTHOUGH HE WAS READY ENOUGH TO GIVE HIS MONEY
OH NO I WAS BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE IN THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN MARRIAGE AND I DID WHAT I THOUGHT BECAME A WOMANLY WOMAN I ASSERTED MY RIGHTS AND MADE A COMMON OR GARDEN ROW THE DOCTOR LAUGHED AS SHE STAMPED HER FOOT AT HIM
MESSENGER BOY WHO BY HER ORDERS AWAITED HER ARRIVAL AS FOR THE CLOSED CARRIAGE THAT SHE ALSO BESPOKE HERSELF AT A SMART LIVERY STABLE WHERE SHE WAS KNOWN WHEN SHE ENTERED IT
THOUGH SUCH OF THE ENGLISH AS I SAW WERE IN GAY ENOUGH SPIRITS AND THERE WAS NOT AN ATMOSPHERE OF DEFEAT FACT IS I KEPT OUT OF SIGHT AND ONLY GOT STRAY IMPRESSIONS GO ON DOWN NOW OR THEY'LL GUESS SOMETHING I'M NOT GOING TO SAY A WORD YET
BUT OF THE WORLD IN WHICH NORMAL PEOPLE LIVE OUR SET HE LAUGHED BUT THAT IS NOT THE WHOLE WORLD ALAS I KNOW THAT MEN WELL BRED CULTIVATED REFINED EVEN HONORABLE MEN SEEM TO BE ABLE TO REPEAT EVERY EMOTION OF LIFE
I DENY IT SAID THE CRITIC MINE HAD REAL LITERARY QUALITY AND A VERY DRAMATIC CLIMAX OH WELL IF DEATH IS DRAMATIC PERHAPS YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE UP TO DATE WHO HAS KILLED HIS HEROINE
I AGREED TO ABIDE THE CONSEQUENCES AND TO ABIDE THEM CALMLY AND DURING ALL THOSE DAYS WHEN I SUPPOSED WE WERE SO NEAR TOGETHER YOU SHOWED ME NOTHING OF THIS THAT WAS IN YOUR HEART
AND HE HAD DARED BE GAY THE MOMENT THE STEAMER SLID INTO THE CHANNEL WAS THAT ONLY THIS MORNING IT SEEMED TO BE IN THE LAST CENTURY SHE APPROACHED AND STRETCHED HER HAND TOWARD THE DOOR HE DID NOT MOVE
THAT SHE VOUCHED FOR A SPECIAL DONATION FOR THE CASE AS A SORT OF COMMEMORATIVE GIFT THE SUM WAS LARGE IT WAS A QUIXOTIC SORT OF SALVE TO A SICK CONSCIENCE WHICH TOLD HER THAT SHE OUGHT TO GO HERSELF THE CHILD STILL SOBBING TURNED AWAY
I RECKON YOU GET THE LAURELS
WHY YOU MIGHT AS WELL FORBID A ROSE TO BLOSSOM BY WORD OF MOUTH AS TRY TO THWART NATURE IN A BEAUTIFUL HEALTHY WOMAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO BRING UP A WOMAN AS I WAS BROUGHT UP ONLY PREPARES HER TO TAKE THE DISTEMPER THE QUICKER
THE GARDEN HAD NEVER BEEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN IT WAS THAT EVENING WITH THE SILVER LIGHT OF THE MOON THROUGH THE TREES AND THE SMELL OF THE FRESHLY WATERED EARTH AND FLOWERS WE HAD NO DOUBT WHO WAS TO CONTRIBUTE THE STORY THE DIVORCEE WAS DRESSED WITH UNUSUAL CARE FOR THE ROLE
IT OBLIGES THEM TO BE LOOKED OVER IN ALL THEIR MISERY IT PRESUMES A WORTHINESS OR ITS PRETENCE WHICH THEY RESENT ALMOST AS MUCH AS THEY DO THE INTRUSION OF THE VISITING COMMITTEE THIS DISINCLINATION IS AS OLD AS POVERTY AND IS THE ROCK AHEAD OF
MEN AND WOMEN KNOW VERY RARELY ANYTHING OF THE GREAT STRUGGLES THAT GO ON IN THE HEARTS OF ONE ANOTHER BESIDES I KNEW HOW EASILY YOU WOULD REPLY NATURALLY WE ARE ALL ON THE DEFENSIVE IN THIS LIFE IT WAS WITH THINGS DEEPER THAN WORDS THAT I WAS DEALING
MY POOR FATHER HAD HOPED WITH HIS TEACHINGS TO SAVE ME FROM FUTURE MISERY HE HAD PROBABLY THOUGHT TO SPARE ME THE COMMONPLACE SORROWS OF LOVE BUT HE COULD NOT THERE IS ONE THING MY CHILD THAT THE PASSING GENERATION CANNOT DO FOR ITS HEIRS LIVE FOR THEM LUCKILY
BUT ACCORDING TO NATURE'S ETERNAL PLAN MY HEART COULD NOT LISTEN TO MY HEAD IT BEAT SO LOUD WHEN YOU WERE BY IT COULD NOT HEAR PERHAPS BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF MY FATHER'S PHILOSOPHY LEFT IN ME
SHE WAS AT ONCE DRIVEN TO THE PARK STREET STATION WHERE SHE BOUGHT A ROUND TRIP TICKET TO WALTHAM THERE SHE WALKED TO THE RIVER HIRED A BOAT
YOUNG AS I WAS I SAID TO MYSELF IF YOU MARRY THIS MAN WITH YOUR EYES OPEN BLAME YOURSELF NOT HIM IF YOU SUFFER I DO BELIEVE THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT
I FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO UP THE OTHER STAIRCASE A LITTLE LATER THE YOUNGSTER WAS AN OLD PET OF MINE AND OFF AND ON I HAD MOTHERED HIM I TAPPED AT THE DOOR CAN'T COME IN
WAS TO GIVE HER MONEY BUT UNLUCKILY SHE BELONGED TO A SOCIETY PLEDGED NOT TO GIVE ALMS IN THE STREETS AND HER SENSE OF THE POWER OF A MORAL OBLIGATION WAS A STRONG NOTION OF DUTY WHICH HAD DESCENDED TO HER FROM HER PURITAN ANCESTORS
WATCHING THE WHITE SAILS AS THE YACHTS MADE FOR MARBLEHEAD HARBOR AND THE LONG LINE OF SURF BEATING AGAINST THE RUGGED ROCKS BEYOND THE WIDE PEBBLY BEACH ON WHICH THE DRAGGING STONES MADE WEIRD MUSIC
AS THE PENALTY OF YOUR LOVE NOTHING MORE I MUST BE SINGULARLY UNFITTED FOR MARRIAGE BECAUSE WHEN THE HOUR CAME IN WHICH I FELT THAT I WAS NO LONGER YOUR WIFE YOUR CHILDREN SEEMED NO LONGER MINE THEY MERELY REPRESENTED THE NEXT GENERATION BORN OF ME
I SUPPOSE YOU THINK ME THE MOST UNGRATEFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD I KNOW ONLY TOO WELL THAT TO MANY WOMEN MY POSITION HAS ALWAYS APPEARED ENVIABLE POOR
YOU KNOW I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS SORT OF THING IT IS REALLY MY VERY FIRST APPEARANCE AND I COULD NOT POSSIBLY TELL IT AS THE REST OF YOU MORE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE CAN DO AND SHE TOOK THE MANUSCRIPT OUT OF HER LACE BAG AND SETTLING HERSELF GRACEFULLY UNROLLED IT
THEN THAT IS SURELY AN ERROR OF CIVILIZATION IF A MAN CAN DISCUSS SUCH MATTERS MORE EASILY WITH A WOMAN WHO IS NOT HIS WIFE IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO FRANKNESS IN MARRIAGE DICK DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT A MAN AND WOMAN STRONGLY ATTRACTED TOWARD ONE ANOTHER
IT DOES NOT SEEM TO UPROOT A MAN'S WHOLE BEING DOES IT SERVE WOMEN IN THAT WAY I BEAR WITNESS THAT IT MAKES SOME OF YOU DEUCEDLY HANDSOME AND I HAVE HEARD THAT IT MAKES SOME OF YOU GOOD YES AS CHASTISEMENT DOES
TAKE OFF YOUR LAURELS CRITIC AND CROWN THE DOCTOR FOR THAT LITTLE TALE SHOUTED THE CRITIC NEVER THAT HAS NOT A BIT OF LITERARY MERIT
SHATTUCK WAS ASTRIDE HIS CHAIR AGAIN HIS ELBOWS ON THE BACK HIS CHIN IN HIS HANDS HE NO LONGER RESPONDED WORDS WERE DANGEROUS HIS LIPS WERE PRESSED CLOSE TOGETHER AND THERE WAS A LONG DEEP LINE BETWEEN HIS EYES
BUT THE SPARK FLICKERED OUT AND I IMAGINE WE SETTLED DOWN FOR THE STORY WITH MORE EAGERNESS THAN ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING ESPECIALLY WHEN THE DOCTOR THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS AND LIFTED HIS CHIN INTO THE AIR AS IF HE WERE IN THE TRIBUNE
AND SHE HAD NONE OF THE SPIRITUAL SUPPORT THAT MADE WOMEN LIKE SAINT CATHERINE OF SIENNA BUT IF EXPERIENCE HAD ROBBED HER OF HER ILLUSIONS SHE KNEW TOO THAT IT HAD SET A SEAL OF PAIN ON ALL THE FUTURE FOR HER
TO HAVE LOST YOU THEN WOULD HAVE KILLED ME SHATTUCK LOOKED AT HER SHARPLY WITH ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE SAID A NEW INTEREST BUT SHE WAS NO LONGER LOOKING AT HIM SHE WENT ON HURRIEDLY YOU LOVED ME OF COURSE I WAS OF YOUR WORLD
MISERABLE SPECIMEN AT FIRST SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER IT WERE BOY OR GIRL WHIMPERING AND MOPPING ITS NOSE WITH A VERY DIRTY HAND
I DO BELIEVE IT TRULY YOU ARE NO MORE CHARITABLE TOWARD MY SEX THAN MOST WOMEN ARE YET NEITHER YOUR TEACHER NOR YOU MAY BE RIGHT A THEORETIC ARGUER LIKE SCHOPENHAUER MAKES GOOD ENOUGH READING FOR CALM MINDS
ALL THE MORE REASON FOR RETURNING IN GOOD SEASON AND HERE IT WAS DARK WORSE STILL THE TRIP HAD BEEN IN EVERY WAY UNSUCCESSFUL SHE HAD TURNED HER FACE HOMEWARD SIMPLY ASKING HERSELF AS SHE HAD DONE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE IF IT WERE
OBVIOUSLY THE THING TO DO WAS TO DELIVER THE CHILD UP TO THE POLICE IT WOULD BE AT ONCE PROPERLY CARED FOR AND THE MOTHER ALSO BUT MISS MORELAND KNEW TOO MUCH OF OFFICIAL CHARITY TO BE GUILTY OF THAT THE EASIEST THING
IT WOULD ONLY BE BY GIVING UP THE WORLD HER WORLD ABANDONING HER LIFE WITH ITS LUXURY ITS LOVE EVERYTHING SHE HAD BEEN BRED TO AND LONGED FOR SHE DID NOT FEEL A CALL TO DO THAT SO SHE CHOSE THE EXISTENCE TO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BORN
DID I NOT FIND A CLEAR LOGICAL MIND GOING THE SAME WAY MY MIND WILL GO I MIGHT BE TROUBLED WITH DOUBTS AND AFRAID THAT I WAS GOING QUITE WRONG WELL THE DEUCE AND ALL WITH A WOMAN WHEN SHE BEGINS TO READ STUFF LIKE THAT IS HER INABILITY TO GENERALIZE
THE RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION WAS AT FIRST CONSOLING AND THEN AMAZING
THEY DARED NOT BROACH THE SUBJECT TO THE PRINCIPAL GIRL AND IN THEIR DISTRESS TURNED TO THE FAMILY LAWYER AS THEY WERE TOO COWARDLY TO TAKE HIS FIRST ADVICE
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS WAS THAT THE WAY IT HAPPENED NO NO REPLIED THE DIVORCEE PETULANTLY THAT IS NOT A BIT THE WAY IT HAPPENED THAT IS THE WAY I WISH IT HAD HAPPENED
SHATTUCK'S HEAD FELL FORWARD ON HIS ARMS THE IDEA OF DENIAL OR PROTEST DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM THE STEADY VOICE WENT MONOTONOUSLY ON I COULD NOT BEAR TO HUMBLE YOU IN THE EYES OF OTHERS EVEN BY FORCING YOU TO FACE A SCANDAL
HAVE YOU AND YET MONTHS BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED I KNEW THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BROKEN YOUR HEART IF THE WEDDING HAD NOT COME OFF AT ALL MY DEAR THE MODERN HEART DOES NOT BREAK EASILY IN THIS AGE WE ARE SCHOOLED TO MEET THE ACCIDENTS OF LIFE WITH SOME PHILOSOPHY AND YET
YET ALL ABOUT US THE COUNTRY WAS SO LOVELY AND SO TRANQUIL HORSES WERE WALKING THE FIELDS AND EVEN AS WE SAT AT DINNER WE COULD HEAR THE VOICES AND THE HEAVY FEET OF THE PEASANT WOMEN AS THEY WENT HOME FROM THEIR WORK
THAT HE FELT AS IF SHE WERE ALREADY A STRANGER TO HIM SHE TOOK A LAST LOOK ROUND THE ROOM HER EYES SEEMED TO DEVOUR EVERY DETAIL I SHALL FIND MEANS TO GIVE YOU YOUR FREEDOM AT ONCE YOU WILL ACTUALLY LEAVE ME
BUT SHE HAD FELT IT ABSURD ALWAYS TO GO ABOUT THIS KIND OF WORK IN A PRIVATE CARRIAGE AND TO DAY SHE COULD NOT AS SHE USUALLY DID TAKE A STREET CAR FOR FEAR OF MEETING FRIENDS THEY THOUGHT HER QUEER ENOUGH AS IT WAS
OR CIVILIZATION PROPOSE TO MAKE FOR THE WOMAN WHOM FATE IN WANTON IRONY REDUCES EVEN IN MARRIAGE TO THE SELF CONSIDERED LEVEL OF THE GIRL IN THE STREET THERE WAS AMAZEMENT EVEN A FOREBODING ON SHATTUCK'S FACE AS HE PAUSED IN HIS WALK
ENCLOSED IT AND SEALED THE ENVELOPE THEN SHE WENT OUT TO THE SIDE WALK AGAIN WITH THE CHILD STOOPING OVER HER SHE MADE SURE THAT THE LITTLE ONE REALLY DID KNOW THE STREET IT ISN'T FAR FROM HERE SHE SAID GIVE THAT TO ANY ONE THERE
SHE HAD NOT RAISED HER VOICE WHICH SEEMED AS WITHOUT FEELING AS IT WAS WITHOUT EMPHASIS SHE CAREFULLY EXAMINED HER HANDKERCHIEF CORNER BY CORNER AND HE NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW THIN HER HANDS HAD BECOME NATURALLY SHE WENT ON IN THAT COLORLESS VOICE
HE LEANED FORWARD AND PICKED UP A BOOK WHICH LAY OPEN ON A CHAIR NEAR HIM AND CARELESSLY GLANCED AT IT SCHOPENHAUER AND HE WRINKLED HIS BROWS AND GLANCED HALF WHIMSICALLY DOWN THE PAGE I NEVER CAN GET USED TO A WOMAN READING THAT STUFF AND IN FRENCH AT THAT
THE LAWYER IS A REALIST SAID THE SCULPTOR OF COURSE THAT APPEALS TO HIM IF YOU WANT MY OPINION I CONSIDER THAT THERE IS JUST AS MUCH IMAGINATION IN THAT STORY
AND MAKE ONE POLYGAMOUS MAN MONOGAMOUS BUT EVEN WHILE THAT HOPE WAS IN MY HEART REASON ROSE UP AND MOCKED IT BIDDING ME ADVANCE INTO THE FUTURE AT MY PERIL I DID IT BUT I MADE A BARGAIN WITH MYSELF
AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT THE LITERATURE TEACHER NEVER DID SHE ALWAYS LOOKED UPON THE INCIDENT AS HER WORST MOMENT OF TACTLESSNESS BULLY BULLY EXCLAIMED THE LAWYER
I AM NOT GOING INTO THAT I ONLY CLAIM THAT MORE PEOPLE KNOW THE CONDITION THAN DARE TO CONFESS IT IT IS AFTER ALL ONLY SYMBOLIC OF THE DUALITY OF THE SOUL OR CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE
I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE TEMPEST ALONE IN SPITE OF REASON IN SPITE OF PHILOSOPHY I HAVE SUFFERED FROM JEALOUSY FROM SHAME FROM RAGE FROM SELF CONTEMPT BUT THAT IS ALL PAST NOW
WOMAN IS ONLY ONE PHASE OF THE CHASE TO HIM A CHASE IN WHICH EVERY ACTIVE VIRILE MAN IS OCCUPIED FROM HIS CRADLE TO HIS GRAVE YOU ARE THE CONQUERORS WE ARE SIMPLY THE CONQUERED SHATTUCK TRIED TO MAKE HIS VOICE LIGHT AS HE SAID
IT WAS IN THE DAYS BEFORE BOSTON HAD MUCH OF AN IMMIGRANT QUARTER WHEN SOME SMART FAMILIES STILL LIVED IN THE OLD COLONIAL HOUSES AT THE NORTH END AND MINISTERS AND LAWYERS AND ALL PROFESSIONAL MEN SENT THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AT THAT TIME PROBABLY
THAT MY WIFE HAS DEVELOPED RATHER SINGULAR TO SAY THE LEAST UNFLATTERING IDEAS OF LIFE
SHE SWEPT BY HIM DOWN THE LONG ROOM EVERYTHING IN WHICH WAS SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH HER BEFORE SHE REACHED THE DOOR HE WAS THERE AND HIS BACK AGAINST IT SHE STOPPED BUT SHE DID NOT LOOK AT HIM
SHE WENT ON FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE COMMUNITY PERHAPS STILL IT IS NOT ALWAYS PLEASANT TO BE A WOMAN AND YET THINK A WOMAN WHOSE REASON HAS BEEN MISTAKENLY DEVELOPED AT THE EXPENSE OF HER CAPACITY TO ENJOY BEING A WOMAN
SOMETIMES READING AND SOMETIMES MERELY STARING OUT AT THE RIVER OR UP AT THE SKY AT SUNSET SHE ROWED BACK TO THE TOWN RETURNED TO THE CITY AND WALKED FROM THE STATION TO HER HOME THIS ALL SEEMED SIMPLE ENOUGH BUT IT PUZZLED THE FATHER
WHEN THE COFFEE CAME OUT
HE STEPPED ASIDE WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM SHE QUICKLY OPENED THE DOOR AND PASSED OUT
I WAS A WOMAN THAT OTHER MEN LIKED AND THEREFORE A DESIRABLE WOMAN I WAS OF GOOD FAMILY ALTOGETHER YOUR SOCIAL EQUAL IN FACT QUITE THE SORT OF WOMAN IT BECAME YOU TO MARRY I PLEASED YOU AND I LOVED YOU
BUT HE IS BAD FOR AN EMOTIONAL TEMPERAMENT AND BY JOVE NAOMI HE WAS A BAD EXAMPLE OF HIS OWN PHILOSOPHY MY DEAR DICK I AM AFRAID I READ SCHOPENHAUER BECAUSE I THOUGHT WHAT HE WRITES LONG BEFORE I EVER HEARD OF HIM I READ HIM BECAUSE
BUT NO ONE COULD EVER GET INTIMATE WITH HER SHE CAME
SHE KNEW THAT HE FELT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS PUPILS AND THIS HAD AN UNPLEASANT LOOK HE TOOK THE PAINS TO VERIFY THE TWO STATEMENTS THEN THERE WAS BUT ONE THING TO DO TO LAY THE MATTER BEFORE THE PARENTS OF THE GIRL
ALL RIGHT LAUGHED THE DOCTOR THEN WE HAD ALL BETTER GO INSIDE THE SANITARIUM WALLS AT ONCE DO YOU PRESUME SAID THE JOURNALIST TO PRETEND THAT THIS IS A NORMAL INCIDENT
YOU THREW AT US LAST NIGHT PERSISTED THE LAWYER WHY DECLARED THE CRITIC I CALL MINE A HEALTHY STORY COMPARED WITH THIS ONE IT IS A SHOCKING TALE FOR THE OPERATING ROOM
WHEN THE WIFE CAME BACK TO THE HAMMOCK TEN MINUTES LATER
THIS DESERTION OF THE ENGLISH PUT AN END TO ORMOND'S AUTHORITY
NOTHING LESS THAN FATAL EXPERIENCE COULD ENGAGE THE ENGLISH PRINCES TO PAY A DUE REGARD TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THAT FORMIDABLE ASSEMBLY THE EARL OF SUFFOLK CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE DYING ABOUT THIS TIME
SO THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO GIVE A DECISIVE OPINION WITH REGARD TO THESE ARTICLES
HIS POLICY HOWEVER HAD THE DESIRED EFFECT HAVING LED THE ARMY WITHOUT DELAY TO WEXFORD HE BEGAN TO BATTER THE TOWN THE GARRISON AFTER A SLIGHT DEFENCE OFFERED TO CAPITULATE BUT BEFORE THEY OBTAINED A CESSATION THEY IMPRUDENTLY NEGLECTED THEIR GUARDS
HAD BASELY SOLD HIM TOGETHER WITH THEIR OWN HONOR TO HIS BARBAROUS ENEMIES
WITHOUT WAITING FOR NEW INCIDENTS WITHOUT COVERING THEMSELVES WITH NEW PRETENCES THEY IMMEDIATELY DESERTED HIM AND REFUSED HIM ALL REASONABLE SUPPLY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY DESIRED NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE HIM PLUNGED IN INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES
AND THOUGH ORDERS WERE ISSUED BY THE MAGISTRATES TO ARREST THEM THESE WERE EXECUTED WITH SUCH SLOWNESS AND RELUCTANCE THAT THE CRIMINALS HAD ALL OF THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING THEIR ESCAPE
AND TO REPAIR THE DISGRACE WHICH THE ARMY HAD SUSTAINED AMONG THE REST HAMBDEN WHO HAD A REGIMENT OF INFANTRY THAT LAY AT A DISTANCE JOINED THE HORSE AS A VOLUNTEER AND OVERTAKING THE ROYALISTS ON CHALGRAVE FIELD ENTERED INTO THE THICKEST OF THE BATTLE
THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF GUILT COULD NOT BE FIXED UPON HIM WHAT IDEA HE ASKED MUST ALL MANKIND ENTERTAIN OF HIS HONOR SHOULD HE SACRIFICE HIS INNOCENT FRIEND TO PECUNIARY CONSIDERATIONS WHAT FURTHER AUTHORITY SHOULD HE RETAIN IN THE NATION
AND RESOUNDED WITH THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED RELIGION FROM THE DESPERATE ATTEMPTS OF PAPISTS AND MALIGNANTS MULTITUDES FLOCKED TOWARDS WESTMINSTER AND INSULTED THE PRELATES AND SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ADHERED TO THE CROWN
AND REDUCING THE KING TO THE RANK OF FIRST MAGISTRATE WHICH WAS THE PROJECT OF THE PRESBYTERIANS THIS SECT MORE ARDENT IN THE PURSUIT OF LIBERTY ASPIRED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF THE MONARCHY AND EVEN OF THE ARISTOCRACY AND PROJECTED AN ENTIRE EQUALITY OF RANK AND ORDER
WHETHER IF UNLIMITED POWER WERE INTRUSTED TO THE PARLIAMENT DURING SO LONG A PERIOD IT WOULD NOT BE EASY FOR THEM TO FRAME THE SUBSEQUENT BILL IN THE MANNER MOST AGREEABLE TO THEMSELVES AND KEEP FOREVER POSSESSION OF THE SWORD AS WELL AS OF EVERY ARTICLE OF CIVIL POWER AND JURISDICTION
WHO WERE APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE OR PERHAPS ACTUATED BY THEIR OWN TERRORS RAN FROM GATE TO GATE CRYING OUT THAT THE CAVALIERS WERE COMING TO BURN THE CITY AND THAT THE KING HIMSELF WAS AT THEIR HEAD
TREDAH AND WEXFORD THE IRISH ACTUATED BY NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS PREJUDICES COULD NO LONGER BE KEPT IN OBEDIENCE BY A PROTESTANT GOVERNOR WHO WAS SO UNSUCCESSFUL IN ALL HIS ENTERPRISES THE CLERGY RENEWED THEIR EXCOMMUNICATIONS AGAINST HIM
CHARLES FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE BY SOME DECISIVE ADVANTAGE TO REDUCE THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT TO A REASONABLE SUBMISSION AND MIGHT THEN EXPECT WITH SECURITY THE MEETING OF A SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
HAVING ENTERED CORNWALL BY BRIDGES THROWN OVER THE TAMAR HASTENED TO AN ACTION LEST STAMWOOD SHOULD JOIN HIM AND OBTAIN THE HONOR OF THAT VICTORY WHICH HE LOOKED FOR WITH ASSURANCE
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THEY THOUGHT WHEN ALL THESE PRETENSIONS WERE METHODISED AND PROSECUTED BY THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGE TO MAINTAIN ANY SHADOW OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SUCH UNLIMITED AUTHORITY IN THE SOVEREIGN
IN THESE RIGID OPINIONS THE WHOLE SECTARIES AMIDST ALL THEIR OTHER DIFFERENCES UNANIMOUSLY CONCURRED THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE INDEPENDENTS KEPT PACE WITH THEIR RELIGIOUS NOT CONTENT WITH CONFINING TO VERY NARROW LIMITS THE POWER OF THE CROWN
ATTENDED BY A FEW LIVERY SERVANTS THE INTELLIGENCE WAS CONVEYED TO LONDON AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY VOTED THAT HE HAD APPEARED IN A HOSTILE MANNER TO THE TERROR AND AFFRIGHT OF HIS MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS
NEWCASTLE HAVING CARRIED ON THE ATTACK OF HULL FOR SOME TIME WAS BEAT OFF BY A SALLY OF THE GARRISON AND SUFFERED SO MUCH THAT HE THOUGHT PROPER TO RAISE THE SIEGE ABOUT THE SAME TIME MANCHESTER WHO ADVANCED FROM THE EASTERN ASSOCIATED COUNTIES
FOR ALLOWING WILMOT TO PASS HIM AND PROCEED WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION TO THE SUCCOR OF THE DISTRESSED INFANTRY AT THE DEVIZES BUT ESSEX FINDING THAT HIS ARMY FELL CONTINUALLY TO DECAY AFTER THE SIEGE OF READING
ALL THE OTHER MEASURES OF THE PARLIAMENT EITHER WERE HITHERTO ABSOLUTELY INSIGNIFICANT OR TENDED RATHER TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE PROTESTANT CAUSE IN IRELAND BY CONTINUING THEIR VIOLENT PERSECUTION AND STILL MORE VIOLENT MENACES AGAINST PRIESTS AND PAPISTS
DOES NOT THE PARLIAMENT CONSIST OF THOSE VERY MEN WHO HAVE EVER OPPOSED ALL WAR WITH SCOTLAND WHO HAVE PUNISHED THE AUTHORS OF OUR OPPRESSIONS WHO HAVE OBTAINED US THE REDRESS OF EVERY GRIEVANCE AND WHO WITH MANY HONORABLE EXPRESSIONS
FROM ALL QUARTERS THE PARLIAMENT WAS HARASSED WITH PETITIONS OF A VERY FREE NATURE WHICH STRONGLY SPOKE THE SENSE OF THE NATION AND PROVED HOW ARDENTLY ALL MEN LONGED FOR THE RESTORATION OF THEIR LAWS AND LIBERTIES
TO MORROW THEY WILL ATTACK SOME BRANCH OF HIS PREROGATIVE BY THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND PROMISES AND PROTESTATIONS THEY HAD ENGAGED THE CROWN IN A WAR AS SOON AS THEY SAW A RETREAT IMPOSSIBLE
IN ORDER TO FORTIFY HIMSELF AGAINST THE RESENTMENT OF JAMES BUCKINGHAM HAD AFFECTED POPULARITY AND ENTERED INTO THE CABALS OF THE PURITANS BUT BEING SECURE OF THE CONFIDENCE OF CHARLES HE HAD SINCE ABANDONED THIS PARTY
THOUGH A DETERMINED PROTESTANT BY PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS INCLINATION HE HAD ENTERTAINED NO VIOLENT HORROR AGAINST POPERY AND A LITTLE HUMANITY HE THOUGHT WAS DUE BY THE NATION TO THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS
THAT WHOEVER DRAWS THE SWORD AGAINST HIS SOVEREIGN SHOULD THROW AWAY THE SCABBARD BY TERRIFYING OTHERS WITH THE FEAR OF VENGEANCE FROM THE OFFENDED PRINCE THEY HAD ENGAGED GREATER NUMBERS INTO THE OPPOSITION AGAINST PEACE THAN HAD ADOPTED THEIR OTHER PRINCIPLES WITH REGARD TO GOVERNMENT AND RELIGION
WHOSE MEMORY THEY RESPECTED AND WHOSE TRAGICAL DEATH THEY DEPLORED
HAD THOUGH UNDER GREAT DISADVANTAGES OF SITUATION AND NUMBERS PUT THE IRISH TO ROUT AND RETURNED IN TRIUMPH TO DUBLIN THE REBELS RAISED THE SIEGE OF TREDAH
THE PEERS VOTED A DECLARATION AGAINST THOSE TUMULTS AND SENT IT TO THE LOWER HOUSE BUT THESE REFUSED THEIR CONCURRENCE SOME SEDITIOUS APPRENTICES BEING SEIZED AND COMMITTED TO PRISON IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED THEIR LIBERTY
AND THE SEVERITY AND APPLICATION REQUISITE TO THE SUPPORT OF DISCIPLINE WERE QUALITIES IN WHICH HE WAS ENTIRELY WANTING WHEN PRINCE RUPERT CONTRARY TO HIS ADVICE RESOLVED ON THIS BATTLE AND ISSUED ALL ORDERS WITHOUT COMMUNICATING HIS INTENTIONS TO HIM
THAT POPULAR ASSEMBLIES AS BY THEIR VERY NUMBER THEY ARE IN A GREAT MEASURE EXEMPT FROM THE RESTRAINT OF SHAME SO WHEN THEY ALSO OVERLEAP THE BOUNDS OF LAW
EXCITED BY EMULATION OR SUPPORTED BY HIS HABITS OF HYPOCRISY ENDEAVORED TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF BEYOND HIS FELLOWS AND TO ARRIVE AT A HIGHER PITCH OF SAINTSHIP AND PERFECTION IN PROPORTION TO ITS DEGREE OF FANATICISM
HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY RETRACT ALL THOSE CONCESSIONS WHICH WITH SO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES OF VIOLENCE AND INDIGNITY THE SCOTS HAVE EXTORTED FROM HIM BESIDES A SENSE OF HIS OWN INTEREST AND A REGARD TO ROYAL POWER WHICH HAS BEEN ENTIRELY ANNIHILATED IN THIS COUNTRY
SOME MAXIMS OF MILITARY OBEDIENCE
THE KING PRESSED THEM ON ONE SIDE PRINCE MAURICE ON ANOTHER SIR RICHARD GRANVILLE ON A THIRD ESSEX ROBARTS AND SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL OFFICERS ESCAPED IN A BOAT TO PLYMOUTH BALFOUR WITH HIS HORSE PASSED THE KING'S OUTPOSTS IN A THICK MIST
AND WHICH LAY AT THAT TIME UNDER PROROGATION BUT BEING TOLD THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD APPEAR UNUSUAL HE ISSUED WRITS FOR SUMMONING A NEW PARLIAMENT ON THE SEVENTH OF MAY AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PRESBYTERIAN DISCIPLINE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED BUT INDULGED STILL IN AN ARDENT PASSION FOR PROPAGATING BY ALL METHODS THAT MODE OF RELIGION IN THE NEIGHBORING KINGDOMS HAVING FLATTERED THEMSELVES IN THE FERVOR OF THEIR ZEAL
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY APPLAUDED THIS GLORIOUS IMITATION OF THE PIETY DISPLAYED BY THEIR ANCESTORS WHO THEY SAID IN THREE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS DURING THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH HAD ENDEAVORED TO ENGAGE THE ENGLISH BY PERSUASION
AFFABILITY AND EVERY AMIABLE VIRTUE THESE MEN FINDING THAT THEIR CREDIT RAN HIGH WITH THE NATION VENTURED TO ENCOURAGE THOSE POPULAR DISORDERS WHICH THEY VAINLY IMAGINED
BEGAN TO DISCOVER ITSELF WITH HIGH CONTEST AND ANIMOSITY THE INDEPENDENTS WHO HAD AT FIRST TAKEN SHELTER AND CONCEALED THEMSELVES UNDER THE WINGS OF THE PRESBYTERIANS NOW EVIDENTLY APPEARED A DISTINCT PARTY AND BETRAYED VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS AND PRETENSIONS
THE KING'S ARMY BY BRINGING OFF THEIR CANNON FROM DENNINGTON CASTLE IN THE FACE OF THE ENEMY SEEMED TO HAVE SUFFICIENTLY REPAIRED THE HONOR WHICH THEY HAD LOST AT NEWBURY
HE TOO EITHER FROM VANITY OR POLITICS HAD VENTURED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN BUT A PRIEST PAST MIDDLE AGE OF A SEVERE CHARACTER AND OCCUPIED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION OR VENGEANCE
THE MATCH WITH FRANCE AND THE ARTICLES IN FAVOR OF CATHOLICS WHICH WERE SUSPECTED TO BE IN THE TREATY WERE LIKEWISE CAUSES OF DISGUST TO THIS WHOLE PARTY
THEY LOADED WITH EXTRAORDINARY CARESSES HAVING ASSOCIATED IN THEIR CAUSE THE COUNTIES OF HERTFORD ESSEX CAMBRIDGE NORFOLK SUFFOLK LINCOLN AND HUNTINGDON THEY GAVE THE EARL OF MANCHESTER A COMMISSION TO BE GENERAL OF THE ASSOCIATION
AND THEY PROCEEDED TO FRAME AN ORDINANCE IN WHICH BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT THEY NAMED LIEUTENANTS FOR ALL THE COUNTIES AND CONFERRED ON THEM THE COMMAND OF THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE OF ALL THE GUARDS
SO FULL WAS CROMWELL OF THESE REPUBLICAN PROJECTS THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS HABITS OF PROFOUND DISSIMULATION HE COULD NOT SO CAREFULLY GUARD HIS EXPRESSIONS BUT THAT SOMETIMES HIS FAVORITE NOTIONS WOULD ESCAPE HIM
THAT BY SUPERNATURAL ASSISTANCES THEY SHOULD BE ENABLED TO CARRY THEIR TRIUMPHANT COVENANT TO THE GATES OF ROME ITSELF IT BEHOVED THEM FIRST TO RENDER IT PREVALENT IN ENGLAND WHICH ALREADY SHOWED SO GREAT A DISPOSITION TO RECEIVE IT
NOW REQUIRED HIM TO ABANDON A PARTY WHERE HE MET WITH SUCH UNWORTHY TREATMENT NEXT MORNING EARLY HE SENT WORD TO THE PRINCE THAT HE WAS INSTANTLY TO LEAVE THE KINGDOM AND WITHOUT DELAY HE WENT TO SCARBOROUGH WHERE HE FOUND A VESSEL WHICH CARRIED HIM BEYOND SEA
AND CHALONER THE INTIMATE FRIEND OF TOMKINS HAD ENTERTAINED LIKE SENTIMENTS AND AS THE CONNECTIONS OF THESE TWO GENTLEMEN LAY CHIEFLY IN THE CITY THEY INFORMED WALLER THAT THE SAME ABHORRENCE OF WAR PREVAILED THERE AMONG ALL MEN OF REASON AND MODERATION
THE WHOLE AUTHORITY IN SCOTLAND
THEY WOULD FIND IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF MEN NOW FORMED BY EXPERIENCE TO COMMAND AND AUTHORITY THAT THE RANK ALONE POSSESSED BY SUCH AS WERE MEMBERS OF EITHER HOUSE PREVENTED ENVY RETAINED THE ARMY IN OBEDIENCE AND GAVE WEIGHT TO MILITARY ORDERS
AND SENT PRINCE MAURICE WITH A DETACHMENT INTO DEVONSHIRE HE DELIBERATED HOW TO EMPLOY THE REMAINING FORCES IN AN ENTERPRISE OF MOMENT SOME PROPOSED AND SEEMINGLY WITH REASON TO MARCH DIRECTLY TO LONDON WHERE EVERY THING WAS IN CONFUSION
THAT HOUSE DESIRED A CONFERENCE WITH THE COMMONS WHOM THEY INFORMED OF THIS UNEXPECTED PROTESTATION THE OPPORTUNITY WAS SEIZED WITH JOY AND TRIUMPH
EVERY MAN HAD FRAMED THE MODEL OF A REPUBLIC AND HOWEVER NEW IT WAS OR FANTASTICAL HE WAS EAGER IN RECOMMENDING IT TO HIS FELLOW CITIZENS OR EVEN IMPOSING IT BY FORCE UPON THEM
AND WHICH BY THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THEIR COVENANT THEY HAD ENGAGED TO DEFEND THEY CONSIDERED BESIDES
AND THAT THE HOUSE OF PEERS WOULD HAVE NO PART IN THE HONOR NAY THEY WENT SO FAR AS OPENLY TO TELL THE LORDS THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF THE WHOLE KINGDOM
WERE ENRAGED TO FIND THAT BY THE TREACHERY OR SUPERIOR CUNNING OF THEN ASSOCIATES THE FRUITS OF ALL THEIR SUCCESSFUL LABORS WERE RAVISHED FROM THEM THE FORMER PARTY FROM INCLINATION AND PRINCIPLE
AND DO ACCORDINGLY CONCEIVE OURSELVES WHOLLY BOUND TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND ARE RESOLVED BY GOD'S HELP TO KEEP THIS CITY ACCORDINGLY
WITHOUT RESPECT OF PERSONS THE EXTIRPATION OF POPERY AND PRELACY SUPERSTITION
HAVING LAID DOWN HIS ARMS AT THE COMMAND OF THE LATE KING HAD RETIRED INTO FRANCE
THE LESS WOULD THEY BE INCLINED TO SECOND THAT RASH AND DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE THAT THE PEERS WOULD CERTAINLY REFUSE THEIR CONCURRENCE NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES OF PREVAILING ON THEM BUT BY INSTIGATING THE POPULACE TO TUMULT AND DISORDER
WHICH BRINGETH SUCH HAPPINESS TO THIS NATION AND MAKES US ENVIED OF ALL OTHERS WHILE THERE IS THIS SWEETNESS BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY AND THE COMMONS LEST WE LOSE THE REPUTE OF A FREE PEOPLE BY OUR TURBULENCY IN PARLIAMENT
THAT THOUGH NO KING THAT EVER WAS IN ENGLAND COULD BE MORE CAREFUL OF YOUR PRIVILEGES THAN I SHALL BE YET IN CASES OF TREASON NO PERSON HAS PRIVILEGE
AND THAT THE PEERS WERE NOTHING BUT INDIVIDUALS WHO HELD THEIR SEATS IN A PARTICULAR CAPACITY AND THEREFORE IF THEIR LORDSHIPS WILL NOT CONSENT TO THE PASSING OF ACTS NECESSARY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE PEOPLE THE COMMONS
AT THE TIME WHEN THE OTHER OFFICERS RESIGNED THEIR COMMISSIONS CARE WAS TAKEN THAT HE SHOULD BE SENT WITH A BODY OF HORSE TO RELIEVE TAUNTON BESIEGED BY THE ROYALISTS HIS ABSENCE BEING REMARKED ORDERS WERE DESPATCHED FOR HIS IMMEDIATE ATTENDANCE IN PARLIAMENT
NOTHING WHICH THEY UNDERTOOK COULD POSSIBLY PROSPER THE PARLIAMENT NO DOUBT CONTINUED HE
BEING DISTINGUISHABLE BY THEIR HABIT AND BEING THE OBJECT OF VIOLENT HATRED TO ALL THE SECTARIES WERE EXPOSED TO THE MOST DANGEROUS INSULTS WILLIAMS NOW CREATED ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
SAT DOWN BEFORE HULL HOTHAM WAS NO LONGER GOVERNOR OF THIS PLACE THAT GENTLEMAN AND HIS SON PARTLY FROM A JEALOUSY ENTERTAINED OF LORD FAIRFAX PARTLY REPENTING OF THEIR ENGAGEMENTS AGAINST THE KING HAD ENTERED INTO A CORRESPONDENCE WITH NEWCASTLE
AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WAS THE MORE EXPOSED TO THEIR HATRED AND RESENTMENT THOUGH THE RELIGIOUS SCHEMES OF MANY OF THE PURITANS WHEN EXPLAINED APPEAR PRETTY FRIVOLOUS WE ARE NOT THENCE TO IMAGINE THAT THEY WERE PURSUED BY NONE BUT PERSONS OF WEAK UNDERSTANDINGS
THAT THIS NOBLEMAN HAD WILFULLY NEGLECTED AT DENNINGTON CASTLE A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY OF FINISHING THE WAR BY A TOTAL DEFEAT OF THE ROYALISTS I SHOWED HIM EVIDENTLY SAID CROMWELL HOW THIS SUCCESS MIGHT BE OBTAINED
HOWEVER RIDICULOUS WERE WILLINGLY ATTENDED TO AND WERE DISPERSED AMONG THE MULTITUDE TO WHOSE CAPACITY THEY WERE WELL ADAPTED BEALE A TAILOR INFORMED THE COMMONS THAT WALKING IN THE FIELDS
OR WHAT PRIVATE SECURITY TO THOSE WHO IN OPPOSITION TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW HAVE SO GENEROUSLY VENTURED THEIR LIVES IN ITS DEFENCE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS APPREHENSION
AND WHILE HE EXPRESSED HIS OWN PENITENCE HE RECEIVED THEIR DEVOUT EXHORTATIONS WITH HUMILITY AND REVERENCE AS CONVEYING CLEARER CONVICTION AND INFORMATION THAN IN HIS LIFE HE HAD EVER BEFORE ATTAINED PRESENTS TOO OF WHICH AS WELL AS OF FLATTERY
VERY LITTLE AUTHORITY IN HIS HANDS AND SCARCELY WOULD AFFORD HIM PERSONAL LIBERTY AND SECURITY AS THE PROSPECT OF AFFAIRS IN IRELAND WAS AT THAT TIME NOT UNPROMISING HE INTENDED
THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND FOND OF HIS RANK AND DIGNITY REGARDED WITH HORROR A SCHEME WHICH IF IT TOOK PLACE
COLONEL URREY A SCOTCHMAN WHO SERVED IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY HAVING RECEIVED SOME DISGUST CAME TO OXFORD AND OFFERED HIS SERVICES TO THE KING IN ORDER TO PROVE THE SINCERITY OF HIS CONVERSION
AND AS ALL ESSENTIAL DISTINCTION WAS DENIED BETWEEN THE LAITY AND THE CLERGY NO CEREMONY NO INSTITUTION NO VOCATION NO IMPOSITION OF HANDS WAS AS IN ALL OTHER CHURCHES SUPPOSED REQUISITE TO CONVEY A RIGHT TO HOLY ORDERS
MUNIFICENT AND GENEROUS IN HIS EXPENSE POLITE AND ELEGANT IN HIS TASTE COURTEOUS AND HUMANE IN HIS BEHAVIOR HE BROUGHT A GREAT ACCESSION OF FRIENDS AND OF CREDIT TO THE PARTY WHICH HE EMBRACED
MANY FEARS AND JEALOUSIES TO BE ALLAYED ERE THEY COULD CORDIALLY ENTERTAIN THOUGHTS OF RESTORING THE FAMILY WHICH THEY HAD SO GRIEVOUSLY OFFENDED AND WHOSE PRINCIPLES THEY REGARDED WITH SUCH VIOLENT ABHORRENCE
THE ONLY ONE WHICH REMAINED OF HIS PREROGATIVE UNDER COLOR OF PROVIDING FOR NATIONAL PEACE ENDANGERED BY THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ENGLISH ARMIES WAS A CONVENTION CALLED AN ASSEMBLY WHICH THOUGH IT MEETS WITH LESS SOLEMNITY
AND OBTAINED THE DOUBLE ADVANTAGE OF PASSING UNMOLESTED AN OPEN COUNTRY AND OF SURPRISING A CONVOY OF PROVISIONS WHICH LAY IN THAT TOWN
NOTWITHSTANDING THE LOW CONDITION INTO WHICH THE HOUSE OF PEERS WAS FALLEN THERE APPEARED SOME INTENTION OF REJECTING THIS ORDINANCE AND THE POPULAR LEADERS WERE AGAIN OBLIGED TO APPLY TO THE MULTITUDE AND TO EXTINGUISH BY THREATS OF NEW TUMULTS
YET HAVING LEARNED ALL MILITARY EXERCISES AND BEING ANIMATED WITH UNCONQUERABLE ZEAL FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENGAGED
AND FOR THE OBSERVANCE AND PRESERVATION OF THE LAWS AND I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS AND ASSIST THOSE LAWS FOR MY PRESERVATION NO SOONER DID THE COMMONS DESPAIR OF OBTAINING THE KING'S CONSENT TO THEIR BILL THAN THEY INSTANTLY VOTED
BUT SO RIVETTED THROUGHOUT THE NATION WERE THE PREJUDICES WITH REGARD TO SPANISH DECEIT AND FALSEHOOD THAT VERY FEW OF THE COMMONS SEEM AS YET TO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SEDUCED BY BUCKINGHAM'S NARRATIVE
STILL RETAINED AN ATTACHMENT TO THE HIERARCHY AND TO THE ANCIENT MODES OF WORSHIP BUT IN THE PRESENT DANGER WHICH THREATENED THEIR CAUSE ALL SCRUPLES WERE LAID ASIDE AND THE COVENANT
DROPPED FROM THESE MEMBERS UPON INQUIRY IT APPEARED THAT NO SUCH EXPRESSIONS HAD BEEN USED THE MEMBERS WERE RELEASED AND THE KING REAPED NO OTHER BENEFIT FROM THIS ATTEMPT THAN TO EXASPERATE THE HOUSE STILL
HIS VEHEMENT TEMPER PROMPTED HIM TO RAISE SUDDENLY TO THE HIGHEST ELEVATION HIS FLATTERERS AND DEPENDANTS AND UPON THE LEAST OCCASION OF DISPLEASURE HE THREW THEM DOWN WITH EQUAL IMPETUOSITY AND VIOLENCE IMPLACABLE IN HIS HATRED
THAN THE COLLECTING OF ANY MAGAZINES STORES OR ARMIES WHICH MIGHT BREED APPREHENSIONS OF VIOLENT OR ILLEGAL COUNSELS BUT THE URGENT NECESSITY OF HIS SITUATION NO LONGER ADMITTED OF DELAY
THESE TROOPS SO LONG AS THEY WERE ALLOWED TO REMAIN WERE USEFUL BY DIVERTING THE FORCE OF THE IRISH REBELS AND PROTECTING IN THE NORTH THE SMALL REMNANTS OF THE BRITISH PLANTERS BUT EXCEPT THIS CONTRACT WITH THE SCOTTISH NATION
DISINTERESTED IN HIS VIEWS OPEN IN HIS CONDUCT HE HAD FORMED ONE OF THE MOST SHINING CHARACTERS OF THE AGE
HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF MANY AND TO RECOVER THEM FROM THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH AT FIRST THEY HAD BEEN SEIZED
WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE COMMAND HE SAILED IMMEDIATELY FOR CADIZ AND FOUND THE BAY FULL OF SPANISH SHIPS OF GREAT VALUE HE EITHER NEGLECTED TO ATTACK THESE SHIPS OR ATTEMPTED IT PREPOSTEROUSLY
BUT THOUGH THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL BORE GREAT FAVOR TO THE KING THE STATES WERE UNEASY AT HIS PRESENCE THEY DREADED THE PARLIAMENT
WHILE OTHERS THOUGHT THAT HIS CONDUCT IN THESE THREE PARTICULARS WOULD ADMIT OF APOLOGY AND EXTENUATION THAT THE LETTER OF THE LAW AS MUCH AS THE MOST FLAMING COURT SERMON INCULCATES PASSIVE OBEDIENCE IS APPARENT
AND THAT NO PEER BE MADE BUT WITH CONSENT OF BOTH HOUSES SHOULD I GRANT THESE DEMANDS SAID THE KING IN REPLY I MAY BE WAITED ON BAREHEADED I MAY HAVE MY HAND KISSED
IS THE MOST NOTED OF THOSE VERY FEW INSTANCES FROM WHICH THE ENEMIES OF THIS PRINCE HAVE ENDEAVORED TO LOAD HIM WITH THE IMPUTATION OF INSINCERITY AND HAVE INFERRED THAT THE PARLIAMENT COULD REPOSE NO CONFIDENCE IN HIS PROFESSIONS AND DECLARATIONS NOT EVEN IN HIS LAWS AND STATUTES
AND HAD MUCH RETARDED THE ADVANCES OF THE KING'S ARMY BY CONTINUAL SALLIES HE INFESTED THEM IN THEIR TRENCHES AND GAINED SUDDEN ADVANTAGES OVER THEM BY DISPUTING EVERY INCH OF GROUND HE REPRESSED THE VIGOR AND ALACRITY OF THEIR COURAGE ELATED BY FORMER SUCCESSES
TO ANSWER THEREFORE ALL THESE GREAT AND IMPORTANT ENDS TO SATISFY THEIR YOUNG KING IN THE FIRST REQUEST WHICH HE MADE THEM TO PROVE THEIR SENSE OF THE MANY ROYAL VIRTUES PARTICULARLY ECONOMY WITH WHICH CHARLES WAS ENDUED
WHILE HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERROR OF EMPLOYING A PLEA OF NECESSITY IN ORDER TO INFRINGE THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION WARNED THE PARLIAMENT NOT TO IMITATE AN EXAMPLE ON WHICH THEY THREW SUCH VIOLENT BLAME AND THE PARLIAMENT
WOULD FIRST BE ATTEMPTED BY CROMWELL AND HE WAS DESIROUS TO EMPLOY THE ENEMY SOME TIME IN THAT SIEGE WHILE HE HIMSELF SHOULD REPAIR HIS BROKEN FORCES BUT CROMWELL KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF DESPATCH HAVING MADE A BREACH HE ORDERED A GENERAL ASSAULT
AND THE ENEMIES OF THE CHURCH WERE SO FAIR FROM THE BEGINNING AS NOT TO LAY CLAIM TO LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE WHICH THEY CALLED A TOLERATION FOR SOUL MURDER THEY OPENLY CHALLENGED THE SUPERIORITY AND EVEN MENACED THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH WITH THAT PERSECUTION
IN ORDER TO REMOVE ALL JEALOUSY HE HAD RESOLVED THAT THEIR USURPATIONS AND ILLEGAL PRETENSIONS SHOULD BE APPARENT TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND THOUGHT THAT TO RECOVER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS A POINT MUCH MORE MATERIAL TO HIS INTEREST
AND APPOINTED AN ARMY TO BE LEVIED UNDER HIS COMMAND BUT ABOVE ALL THEY WERE INTENT THAT ESSEX'S ARMY ON WHICH THEIR WHOLE FORTUNE DEPENDED SHOULD BE PUT IN A CONDITION OF MARCHING AGAINST THE KING
AND ITS PROFESSORS AND ON PRETENCE OF RENDERING MORE SIMPLE THE DISTRIBUTION OF JUSTICE WERE DESIROUS OF ABOLISHING THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF ENGLISH JURISPRUDENCE
THIS ARTICLE TOGETHER WITH THE NEW IMPOSITIONS LAID ON MERCHANDISE BY JAMES CONSTITUTED NEAR HALF OF THE CROWN REVENUES AND BY DEPRIVING THE KING OF THESE RESOURCES THEY WOULD HAVE REDUCED HIM TO TOTAL SUBJECTION AND DEPENDENCE
WHICH MIGHT OBLIGE THE PARLIAMENT TO ACCEPT OF REASONABLE CONDITIONS AND RESTORE PEACE TO THE NATION THE CHARMS OF HIS CONVERSATION JOINED TO HIS CHARACTER OF COURAGE AND INTEGRITY HAD PROCURED HIM THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF NORTHUMBERLAND CONWAY
YET LEST ANY AMBIGUITY SHOULD REMAIN SIR DUDLEY CARLETON VICE CHAMBERLAIN TOOK CARE TO EXPLAIN IT I PRAY YOU CONSIDER SAID HE WHAT THESE NEW COUNSELS ARE OR MAY BE I FEAR TO DECLARE THOSE THAT I CONCEIVE
THE KING'S PARTISANS HAD ALL ALONG MAINTAINED THAT THE FEARS AND JEALOUSIES OF THE PARLIAMENT AFTER THE SECURITIES SO EARLY AND EASILY GIVEN TO PUBLIC LIBERTY WERE EITHER FEIGNED OR GROUNDLESS AND THAT NO HUMAN INSTITUTION COULD BE BETTER POISED AND ADJUSTED
YET HE COULD ASSURE THEM THAT THEIR TROOPS CONTAINED GENERALS FIT TO COMMAND IN ANY ENTERPRISE IN CHRISTENDOM THE ARMY INDEED HE WAS SORRY TO SAY IT DID NOT CORRESPOND BY ITS DISCIPLINE TO THE MERIT OF THE OFFICERS NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES
THE MECHANIC INDULGING THE FERVORS OF ZEAL AND GUIDED BY THE ILLAPSES OF THE SPIRIT RESIGNED HIMSELF TO AN INWARD AND SUPERIOR DIRECTION AND WAS CONSECRATED IN A MANNER BY AN IMMEDIATE INTERCOURSE AND COMMUNICATION WITH HEAVEN THE CATHOLICS
THAT THEY HAD TRAITOROUSLY ENDEAVORED TO SUBVERT THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS AND GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM TO DEPRIVE THE KING OF HIS REGAL POWER AND TO IMPOSE ON HIS SUBJECTS AN ARBITRARY AND TYRANNICAL AUTHORITY THAT THEY HAD ENDEAVORED
UPON REFLECTION IT SEEMED NOT IMPRACTICABLE THAT A COMBINATION MIGHT BE FORMED BETWEEN THE LORDS AND CITIZENS AND BY MUTUAL CONCERT THE ILLEGAL TAXES BE REFUSED
STAMFORD BEING ENCAMPED ON THE TOP OF A HIGH HILL NEAR STRATUM THEY ATTACKED HIM IN FOUR DIVISIONS AT FIVE IN THE MORNING HAVING LAIN ALL NIGHT UNDER ARMS ONE DIVISION WAS COMMANDED BY LORD MOHUN AND SIR RALPH HOPTON
AND WHO FROM A PRIVATE STATION HAD MOUNTED IN THE EARLIEST YOUTH
TO FIND SECURITY FOR BOTH PARTIES ESPECIALLY FOR THAT OF THE PARLIAMENT AMIDST SUCH VIOLENT ANIMOSITIES POWER ALONE COULD INSURE SAFETY AND THE POWER OF ONE SIDE WAS NECESSARILY ATTENDED WITH DANGER TO THE OTHER
AND FIRMLY UNITED BY ZEAL AND PASSION AS BY THE MOST LEGAL AND ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT A SMALL COMMITTEE ON WHOM THE TWO HOUSES DEVOLVED THEIR POWER HAD DIRECTED ALL THEIR MILITARY OPERATIONS AND HAD PRESERVED A SECRECY IN DELIBERATION
UNDER COLOR OF REDRESSING GRIEVANCES WHICH DURING THIS SHORT REIGN COULD NOT BE VERY NUMEROUS THEY WERE TO PROCEED IN REGULATING AND CONTROLLING EVERY PART OF GOVERNMENT WHICH DISPLEASED THEM
WHICH WAS BEFORE SUFFICIENTLY PROVIDED WITH RELIGIOUS AS WELL AS CIVIL CAUSES OF QUARREL WAS ALSO SUPPLIED WITH PARTY NAMES UNDER WHICH THE FACTIONS MIGHT RENDEZVOUS AND SIGNALIZE THEIR MUTUAL HATRED
AND THOUGH THE SPIRIT OF A LIMITED GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO REQUIRE IN EXTRAORDINARY CASES SOME MITIGATION OF SO RIGOROUS A DOCTRINE IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THE PRESIDING GENIUS OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION
THE PARLIAMENT FOR SO WE MUST HENCEFORTH CALL A SMALL AND INCONSIDERABLE PART OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAVING MURDERED THEIR SOVEREIGN WITH SO MANY APPEARING CIRCUMSTANCES OF SOLEMNITY AND JUSTICE AND SO MUCH REAL VIOLENCE
CARRIED THEM TO EMBRACE OPPOSITE MAXIMS IN THEIR POLITICAL CONDUCT THOUGH INVITED BY THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT TO MODEL THEIR GOVERNMENT INTO A REPUBLICAN FORM THEY RESOLVED STILL TO ADHERE TO MONARCHY WHICH HAD EVER PREVAILED IN THEIR COUNTRY
CROMWELL PRETENDED TO RETALIATE BY THIS SEVERE EXECUTION THE CRUELTY OF THE IRISH MASSACRE BUT HE WELL KNEW THAT ALMOST THE WHOLE GARRISON WAS ENGLISH AND HIS JUSTICE WAS ONLY A BARBAROUS POLICY IN ORDER TO TERRIFY ALL OTHER GARRISONS FROM RESISTANCE
WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOT OF A CIVIL BUT OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE THE DISTEMPERED IMAGINATIONS OF MEN WERE AGITATED WITH A CONTINUAL DREAD OF POPERY WITH A HORROR AGAINST PRELACY WITH AN ANTIPATHY TO CEREMONIES AND THE LITURGY
MANY OF THE PRESBYTERIANS SHOWED THE INCONVENIENCE AND DANGER OF THE PROJECTED ALTERATION WHITLOCKE IN PARTICULAR A MAN OF HONOR WHO LOVED HIS COUNTRY THOUGH IN EVERY CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT HE ALWAYS ADHERED TO THE RULING POWER SAID
IN ALL CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS YOU KNOW THAT PARLIAMENTS WERE IN USE ANCIENTLY BY WHICH THOSE KINGDOMS WERE GOVERNED IN A MOST FLOURISHING MANNER UNTIL THE MONARCHS BEGAN TO KNOW THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND SEEING THE TURBULENT SPIRIT OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS AT LENGTH
AND THE SECTARIES RESOLVED TO GRATIFY THEIR VENGEANCE IN THE PUNISHMENT OF THIS PRELATE WHO HAD SO LONG BY HIS AUTHORITY AND BY THE EXECUTION OF PENAL LAWS KEPT THEIR ZEALOUS SPIRIT UNDER CONFINEMENT
THE TITLE OF MAJESTY MAY BE CONTINUED TO ME AND THE KING'S AUTHORITY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES MAY STILL BE THE STYLE OF YOUR COMMANDS I MAY HAVE SWORDS AND MACES CARRIED BEFORE ME
HE DARED TO CARRY HIS AMBITIOUS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN HERSELF AND HE FAILED NOT TO MAKE IMPRESSION ON A HEART NOT UNDISPOSED TO THE TENDER PASSIONS THAT ATTACHMENT AT LEAST OF THE MIND WHICH APPEARS SO DELICIOUS AND IS SO DANGEROUS
NO INTERPOSITION OF THE MAGISTRATE IN RELIGIOUS CONCERNS NO FIXED ENCOURAGEMENT ANNEXED TO ANY SYSTEM OF DOCTRINES OR OPINIONS ACCORDING TO THEIR PRINCIPLES EACH CONGREGATION UNITED VOLUNTARILY AND BY SPIRITUAL TIES
MOBBISH COMBATS AND SKIRMISHES ENSUED THE PARLIAMENT ON THIS OCCASION WENT SO FAR AS TO VOTE THAT WHEN THE LORDS AND COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT WHICH IS THE SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE
THEY CONFIRMED THE IRISH CATHOLICS IN THEIR REBELLION AND CUT OFF ALL HOPES OF INDULGENCE AND TOLERATION BY DISPOSING BEFOREHAND OF ALL THE IRISH FORFEITURES TO SUBSCRIBERS OR ADVENTURERS THEY RENDERED ALL MEN OF PROPERTY DESPERATE
HIS GARRISON HOWEVER WAS REDUCED TO THE LAST EXTREMITY AND HE FAILED NOT FROM TIME TO TIME TO INFORM THE PARLIAMENT THAT UNLESS SPEEDILY RELIEVED HE SHOULD BE NECESSITATED FROM THE EXTREME WANT OF PROVISIONS AND AMMUNITION TO OPEN HIS GATES TO THE ENEMY
THE KING SEEMED DESIROUS OF EMBRACING EVERY OPPORTUNITY BY WHICH HE COULD EXPRESS A CONTEMPT AND DISREGARD FOR THEM NO ONE WAS AT THAT TIME SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE OF THE GREAT WEIGHT WHICH THE COMMONS BORE IN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
AND WEARING IN THEIR HATS BLACK AND SEA GREEN RIBBONS BY WAY OF FAVORS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND ASSEMBLED AT BURFORD UNDER THE COMMAND OF THOMSON A MAN FORMERLY CONDEMNED FOR SEDITION BY A COURT MARTIAL BUT PARDONED BY THE GENERAL
THIS VERY HOUSE OF COMMONS IN THEIR FAMOUS REMONSTRANCE TOOK CARE TO JUSTIFY THEMSELVES AS FROM THE HIGHEST IMPUTATION FROM ANY INTENTION TO RELAX THE GOLDEN REINS OF DISCIPLINE AS THEY CALLED THEM OR TO GRANT ANY TOLERATION
THAT A TOTAL CONFUSION OF ALL RANK AND ORDER WAS JUSTLY TO BE APPREHENDED AND THE WONDER WAS NOT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE NOBLES SHOULD SEEK SHELTER UNDER THE THRONE
THEY BY LITTLE AND LITTLE BEGAN TO STAND ON THEIR PREROGATIVES AND AT LAST OVERTHREW THE PARLIAMENTS THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM
ALL LAWYERS AND DIVINES WHO HAD EMBRACED THE KING'S PARTY SHOULD BE RENDERED INCAPABLE OF ANY OFFICE BE FORBIDDEN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR PROFESSION BE PROHIBITED FROM COMING WITHIN THE VERGE OF THE COURT AND FORFEIT THE THIRD OF THEIR ESTATES TO THE PARLIAMENT
AS IF THEIR BUSINESS WERE CHIEFLY BY PROVOKING THE KING TO MAKE HIM VIOLATE HIS OWN SAFE CONDUCT THE ANSWER FROM THE CITY WAS IN THESE WORDS WE THE INHABITANTS MAGISTRATES OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS WITHIN THE GARRISON OF GLOUCESTER
WITH ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF RAGE AND CONTUMELY HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH BY HIS ZEALOUS COUNTRYMEN THOUGH IN THIS INSTANCE THE KING SAW MORE EVIDENTLY THE FURIOUS SPIRIT BY WHICH THE SCOTS WERE ACTUATED
WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GENTLE GOVERNMENT HAD FIRST EXCITED A REBELLION AGAINST THE LATE KING AFTER THE MOST UNLIMITED CONCESSIONS HAD RENEWED THEIR REBELLION AND STOPPED THE PROGRESS OF HIS VICTORIES IN ENGLAND
THAT THE KING MIGHT DESPAIR OF ALL COMPOSITION
LORD FALKLAND HAD ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY A MAN WHO ADORNED THE PUREST VIRTUE WITH THE RICHEST GIFTS OF NATURE AND THE MOST VALUABLE ACQUISITIONS OF LEARNING BY HIM ASSISTED BY THE KING HIMSELF
THE POWER OF FRANCE FREED FROM THIS IMPEDIMENT WOULD SOON BECOME FORMIDABLE TO ENGLAND AND TO ALL THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS THOUGH CHARLES PROBABLY BORE BUT SMALL FAVOR TO THE HUGONOTS WHO SO MUCH RESEMBLED THE PURITANS IN DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP
AND IF THE KING EITHER CUT THEM SHORT IN THIS UNDERTAKING OR REFUSED COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR DEMANDS HE MUST NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPLY FROM THE COMMONS GREAT DISSATISFACTION WAS EXPRESSED BY CHARLES AT A TREATMENT WHICH HE DEEMED SO HARSH AND UNDUTIFUL
SIR DUDLEY DIGGES SIR JOHN ELLIOT SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH MISTER SELDEN AND MISTER PYM ANIMATED WITH A WARM REGARD TO LIBERTY
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HAVE I VIOLATED YOUR LAWS HAVE I DENIED TO PASS ANY BILL FOR THE EASE AND SECURITY OF MY SUBJECTS I DO NOT ASK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME
YESTERDAY I SENT A SERJEANT AT ARMS TO DEMAND SOME WHO BY MY ORDER WERE ACCUSED OF HIGH TREASON INSTEAD OF OBEDIENCE I RECEIVED A MESSAGE I MUST HERE DECLARE TO YOU
BUT UPON CONDITION OF HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND STRICT OBSERVANCE OF THE COVENANT AND HIS ENTERTAINING NO OTHER PERSONS ABOUT HIM BUT SUCH AS WERE GODLY MEN AND FAITHFUL TO THAT OBLIGATION
BUCKINGHAM THOUGH LYING UNDER IMPEACHMENT WAS YET BY MEANS OF COURT INTEREST CHOSEN IN HIS PLACE THE COMMONS RESENTED AND LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF THIS AFFRONT AND THE MORE TO ENRAGE THEM THE KING HIMSELF WROTE A LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY EXTOLLING THE DUKE
AFTER MANY FRUITLESS EVASIONS THE KING
TO LAY ASIDE ALL PRIVATE ENDS AND RENOUNCE EVERY OFFICE ATTENDED WITH PROFIT OR ADVANTAGE THAT THE ABSENCE OF SO MANY MEMBERS OCCUPIED IN DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENTS HAD RENDERED THE HOUSE EXTREMELY THIN AND DIMINISHED THE AUTHORITY OF THEIR DETERMINATIONS
ABOVE FORTY THOUSAND MEN PASSED INTO FOREIGN SERVICE AND CROMWELL
TERRIFIED WITH THE PROSPECT OF RENEWING HIS PAINS AND FATIGUE HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO MAINTAIN THE FEW RESOURCES WHICH REMAINED TO A DESPERATE CAUSE AND THOUGHT THAT THE SAME REGARD TO HONOR WHICH HAD AT FIRST CALLED HIM TO ARMS
THE CORNISH IN THREE DIVISIONS ATTACKED THE WEST SIDE WITH A RESOLUTION WHICH NOTHING COULD CONTROL BUT THOUGH THE MIDDLE DIVISION HAD ALREADY MOUNTED THE WALL SO GREAT WAS THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE GROUND AND SO BRAVE THE DEFENCE OF THE GARRISON
THESE GENTLEMEN GAVE THE RABBLE THE APPELLATION OF ROUNDHEADS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SHORT CROPPED HAIR WHICH THEY WORE THESE CALLED THE OTHERS CAVALIERS AND THUS THE NATION
UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THEY PRETENDED BY A VERBAL CRITICISM ON THE TENSE OF A LATIN VERB TO RAVISH FROM THE KING HIS NEGATIVE VOICE IN THE LEGISLATURE
BEDFORD HOLLAND AND CONWAY HAD DESERTED THE PARLIAMENT AND HAD GONE TO OXFORD CLARE AND LOVELACE HAD FOLLOWED THEM
HE ASKED THE SPEAKER WHO STOOD BELOW WHETHER ANY OF THESE PERSONS WERE IN THE HOUSE THE SPEAKER FALLING ON HIS KNEE PRUDENTLY REPLIED I HAVE SIR
MANY SPEECHES WERE MADE TO THE CITIZENS BY THE PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS
THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED PROVINCES WERE MUCH ATTACHED TO HIS INTERESTS BESIDES HIS CONNECTION WITH THE FAMILY OF ORANGE WHICH WAS EXTREMELY BELOVED BY THE POPULACE ALL MEN REGARDED WITH COMPASSION HIS HELPLESS CONDITION
SOON AFTER DESERTED TO THE PARLIAMENT SOME IRISH CATHOLICS CAME OVER WITH THESE TROOPS AND JOINED THE ROYAL ARMY WHERE THEY CONTINUED THE SAME CRUELTIES AND DISORDERS TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED
DURING THIS TIME OF DISORDER AND DANGER OFFERED THEIR SERVICE TO THE KING BETWEEN THEM AND THE POPULACE THERE PASSED FREQUENT SKIRMISHES WHICH ENDED NOT WITHOUT BLOODSHED BY WAY OF REPROACH
GAVE A TOTAL DEFEAT TO THEIR ENEMIES RUTHVEN WITH A FEW BROKEN TROOPS FLED TO SALTASH AND WHEN THAT TOWN WAS TAKEN HE ESCAPED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AND ALMOST ALONE INTO PLYMOUTH STAMFORD RETIRED
THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND HAD NEVER HITHERTO AFFORDED ONE INSTANCE WHERE ANY GREAT MOVEMENT OR REVOLUTION HAD PROCEEDED FROM THE LOWER HOUSE AND AS THEIR RANK BOTH CONSIDERED IN A BODY AND AS INDIVIDUALS WAS BUT THE SECOND IN THE KINGDOM
RENDERED HIM MORE DEPENDENT AND MORE EXPOSED TO THE ENCROACHMENTS OF THE COMMONS HE WAS RESOLVED TO TRY ONCE MORE THAT REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL EXPEDIENT FOR SUPPLY PERHAPS TOO A LITTLE POLITICAL ART WHICH AT THAT TIME HE PRACTISED
AND ONLY DESIRED LEAVE WITH MY OWN BRIGADE OF HORSE TO CHARGE THE KING'S ARMY IN THEIR RETREAT LEAVING IT IN THE EARL'S CHOICE IF HE THOUGHT PROPER
AND MORE ACTUATED BY PRINCIPLE
MOST OF HIS ENGLISH COUNSELLORS DISSUADED HIM FROM ACCEPTING CONDITIONS SO DISADVANTAGEOUS AND DISHONORABLE THEY SAID
BEING A NATIVE OF IRELAND AND A PERSON ENDOWED WITH GREAT PRUDENCE AND VIRTUE FORMED A SCHEME FOR COMPOSING THE DISORDERS OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR ENGAGING THE REBEL IRISH TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE OF HIS ROYAL MASTER
THERE WERE MANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH STRONGLY INVITED THE NATIVES OF IRELAND TO EMBRACE THE KING'S PARTY
AND THE HEARTS OF HIS LOYAL SUBJECTS WHICH WITH GOD'S BLESSING HE DOUBTED NOT WOULD RECOVER ALL THE REST COLLECTING THEREFORE SOME FORCES HE ADVANCED SOUTHWARDS
AND A VIGOROUS OFFENSIVE WAR BE WAGED AGAINST THESE MIGHTY POTENTATES ERE THEY WOULD RESIGN A PRINCIPALITY WHICH THEY HAD NOW FULLY SUBDUED AND WHICH THEY HELD IN SECURE POSSESSION BY ITS BEING SURROUNDED WITH ALL THEIR OTHER TERRITORIES
ESSEX'S HORSE WERE SEVERAL TIMES BROKEN BY THE KING'S BUT HIS INFANTRY MAINTAINED THEMSELVES IN FIRM ARRAY AND BESIDES GIVING A CONTINUED FIRE THEY PRESENTED AN INVINCIBLE RAMPART OF PIKES AGAINST THE FURIOUS SHOCK OF PRINCE RUPERT
THE WOUNDED MAN UTTERED A LOW GROAN THAT THRILLED ME AND THEN SENT A COLD SHUDDER THROUGH MY VEINS FOR I WAS ALMOST TOUCHING HIM AND SET ASIDE THE FEELING OF HORROR AT HAVING BEEN AS IT WERE PARTNER IN INFLICTING HIS INJURY
AND SEEMED TO BE ENDEAVOURING TO COMPREHEND WHAT I SAID MY FATHER THE PRISONER I SAID AGAIN WITH MY LIPS NOW TO HIS EAR PRISONER
JUSS FASS NOW AND AS HE SPOKE
AT LAST HE BENT DOWN AND WHISPERED A FEW WORDS TO HIS PATIENT WHO IMMEDIATELY ROSE ORDERS WERE THEN GIVEN TO THE BLACKS WHO WERE TO STAY UNDER THE COMMAND OF JACK PENNY AND FOLLOWED BY JIMMY
THE SCOURING OF THE ROCKS MUST HAVE BEEN INCESSANT THEN MY THOUGHTS CAME BACK TO OUR HORRIBLE POSITION
BE QUIET AND FOLLOW HIM JUST THEN OUR GUIDE STOPPED AND LET ME GO TO HIS SIDE FEVER MY HEAD HE SAID SOFTLY AND AS IF APOLOGISING CAN'T THINK
THEN I BEGAN TO THINK OF MY MOTHER AND FATHER HOW I SHOULD HAVE FAILED IN HELPING THEM AND I REMEMBER THINKING WHAT A GOOD JOB IT WAS THAT MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME
NEAR THE END MY COMPANIONS SEEMED AVERSE TO SPEAKING TO ME OR EACH OTHER BUT WERE EVIDENTLY MOODY AND THOUGHTFUL ALL BUT JIMMY WHO SEEMED TO BE GETTING EXCITED
AND TAUGHT ME HOW TO CATCH THE SPEAR ON A SHIELD AND TO AVOID BLOWS MADE WITH WADDIES JIMMY'S LESSONS WERE NOT THROWN AWAY I COULD AVOID A THROWN SPEAR THOUGH HELPLESS
AND GYP BEGAN WHINING AND PADDLING ABOUT ASKING US AS IT WERE WITH HIS INTELLIGENT EYES WHETHER WE DID NOT MEAN TO START HI GYP GYP SHOUTED JIMMY JUST THEN
ABUTMENT AND REACHING UP AS HIGH AS HE COULD BEGAN TO CLIMB IT DID NOT SEEM TO OCCUR TO HIM AT FIRST THAT IF HE WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE NO ONE ELSE WOULD BE AND HE TRIED TWICE
SNUFFED AT IT LAPPED A LITTLE AND THREW UP HIS HEAD AGAIN BARKING AND SPLASHING IN IT A LITTLE AS HE RAN IN BREAST HIGH AND CAME BACK AS IF INTIMATING THAT HE WAS
IT WAS AS IF HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF FOR THE WORST AND WAS NOW GOING TO MAKE STRENUOUS EFFORTS TO SAVE HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS
A BULLET WOUND NOT A DANGEROUS ONE AT ALL TO MY ASTONISHMENT HE WENT ON TALKING QUITE CALMLY AND WITHOUT ANY OF THE DAZED LOOK AND THE STRANGE HABIT OF FORGETTING HIS OWN TONGUE TO CONTINUE IN THAT OF THE PEOPLE AMONG WHOM HE HAD BEEN A PRISONER FOR SO LONG
CHAPTER THIRTY HOW I TALKED WITH MY NEW FRIEND AS I HEARD THE SOUND OF THE PURSUIT A HORRIBLE SENSATION OF DREAD CAME OVER ME I FELT THAT WE MUST BE TAKEN AND IN ADDITION
WHILE IF ON THE OTHER HAND WE DID NOT RESIST ALL HOPE OF RESCUING MY POOR FATHER WOULD BE GONE WE MUST FIGHT I SAID TO MYSELF SETTING MY TEETH HARD AND BRINGING MY GUN TO BEAR ON THE SPOT WHERE I COULD SEE SOMETHING MOVING
AND THIS MEANT REVEALING OUR POSITION AND THERE ALL THE TIME WERE THE ENEMY STEADILY MAKING THEIR WAY RIGHT TOWARDS US WHAT SHALL I DO I SAID TO MYSELF AS I REALISED IN A SMALL WAY WHAT MUST BE THE FEELINGS OF A GENERAL WHO FINDS THAT THE BATTLE IS GOING AGAINST HIM
AND HERE THE DOCTOR SET HIMSELF TO WORK TO MORE SECURELY BANDAGE HIS PATIENT'S SHOULDER JACK PENNY LOOKING ON RESTING UPON HIS GUN AND WEARING A COUNTENANCE FULL OF MISERY THERE SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN HE HAD FINISHED
GET MUCH TOO MUCH WATER MASS JOE HE SAID WHAT UM GOING TO DO I SHOOK MY HEAD SADLY
IN A NICHE OF THE ROCK WHERE THEIR WEIGHT AND THE SHELTER MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM BEING WASHED AWAY
IT IS ENOUGH TO SCARE ANYBODY BUT I'LL TRY AND LET THEM SEE THAT I BELONG TO A SUPERIOR RACE AND WILL NOT SHOW WHAT I FEEL MY EYES KEPT WANDERING ABOUT EAGERLY FIRST TO LOOK WHERE MY COMPANIONS
BENEATH WHICH IT WAS BLACK AS EVER BUT OUTSIDE THE STARS SHONE BRILLIANTLY AND IT WAS COMPARATIVELY LIGHT
AND BE SEIZED AND KNOCKED ON THE HEAD FOR CERTAIN THE FIERCE RESISTANCE HE WOULD MAKE CERTAINLY WOULD CAUSE HIS DEATH AND I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT
NO MY LAD HE SAID NOTHING
STOP HIM RUN AFTER HIM HE MUST NOT GO I CRIED I STOPPED FOR THERE WAS A LOW PIPING WHISTLE LIKE THE CRY OF A BLUE MOUNTAIN PARROT BACK AT HOME JACK PENNY I GASPED AND I ANSWERED THE CALL
DEAR JOE CAME BACK AND WELL IT WAS IN THE DARK AND WE WERE NOT ASHAMED
AND WARMTH WAS RAPIDLY RESTORED TO OUR LIMBS BY ROCKS THAT SOON GREW HEATED IN THE TORRID RAYS BIG BUNYIP GOT NO MORE WATER ALL GONE DIS TIME SAID JIMMY CALMLY
AND MYSELF WITH JIMMY FOR GUIDE JACK PENNY WAS TO TAKE COMMAND OF THE CAVE AND BE READY TO DEFEND IT AND HELP US IF ATTACKED OR WE WERE PURSUED AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS TO HAVE THE BEARERS
AND ANOTHER BEGAN WE DARED NOT STIR FOR NOW IT SEEMED TO BE SO LIGHT
LAY THE SEA WITH OUR SCHOONER BUT THE OTHER WAS GONE
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX HOW THE DOCTOR FOUND A PATIENT READY TO HIS HAND WE WAITED FOR SOME MINUTES CROUCHED THERE AMONG THE BUSHES LISTENING TO THE COMING OF THOSE WHO FORCED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE TREES
THAT THEY SHOULD GIVE WAY JUST AT A TIME WHEN A BOLD ATTACK WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ENDED IN OUR DESTRUCTION BUT I COULD MAKE OUT NOTHING
NO I MEAN DRESSED DOWN LIKE THAT WAS AN ENGLISHMAN IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE PENNY YOU MUST BE MORE CAREFUL IF YOU MEAN TO HANDLE A GUN HERE TAKE IT AWAY SAID JACK PENNY BITTERLY
THE VILLAGE IS ON FIRE AND THE BLACKS MUST SEE YOU IF YOU ARE TAKEN NOW YOU WILL BE KILLED WITHOUT MERCY WE MUST RISK IT I SAID EXCITEDLY STEPPING FORWARD AND YOUR FATHER TOO I RECOILED
AS HIGH AS WE COULD ON LEDGES AND BLOCKS OF STONE
HE SLIPPED AWAY FROM US BEFORE WE COULD STOP HIM AND WHILE WE WERE DEBATING AS TO WHETHER WE HAD NOT BETTER RUSH IN AND FIGHT IN HIS DEFENCE THE SAVAGES CROWDED INTO THE HUT AND ONCE MORE THERE WAS A LOUD BUZZ OF VOICES
THE EXCITEMENT I FELT WAS SO GREAT THAT IT SEEMED A VERY LITTLE WHILE BEFORE JIMMY STOPPED SHORT TO LISTEN HEAR UM TALKUM TALKUM HE WHISPERED WE COULD NEITHER OF US HEAR A SOUND
I KNEW THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN BURNED TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND THEN SUNK I BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FATE OF THE OTHER SCHOONER'S CREW
AS THE RIVER ROSE WHEN THE BLACK CAME TO ME AND TOUCHED MY SHOULDER
NO KNOW WHAT UM SAY CRIED THE BLACK IMPATIENTLY CAN'T GET AWAY I SAID NO GET WAY WAITUM WAITUM JIMMY JIMMY SEE
WHERE WE STOOD WITH THE WATER RISING STILL HIGHER
JIMMY MIGHT HAVE MANAGED TO ESCAPE PERHAPS HIS BLACK SKIN WOULD MAKE HIM BE LOOKED UPON AS A FRIEND BUT THE OLD CAPTAIN WHAT ABOUT HIM HE WOULD RETURN
SO FOLLOWED THE DOCTOR INTO THE CAVE CLIMBED THE RIFT WITH HIM
MASS JOE NO GUN NO POWDER POP NO CHOPPER NO KNIFE NO FIGHT WORKS TALL WHERE IS HE I SAID EXCITEDLY AS I HELD THE ARM OF OUR GUIDE BLACKS COMING AFTER US
ALL OVER BIG COUNTRY WATER ALL GONE JIMMY CUNNING ARTFUL NOT MEAN DIE DIS TIME BUNYIP NOT GOT NUFF WATER GIVE JIMMY SOMETHING EAT
AND THEN RISE UP AND LOOK ROUND AT HIS COMPANIONS SAYING A FEW WORDS IN THEIR TONGUE THE CHILL OF HORROR CAME BACK ONCE MORE
WAITING TO SEE IF THE BLACK HAD MADE ANY DISCOVERY AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO ME AN INTERMINABLE TIME I HEARD A SLIGHT RUSTLING SOUND AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT THERE WAS A HAND UPON MY ARM AND DIRECTLY AFTER A WARM PAIR OF LIPS UPON MY EAR
SWIM MUCH FASS ALL DOWN A WATER WON'T DIE OH NO OH NO THERE WAS SO MUCH HOPE AND CONFIDENCE IN THE BLACK'S MANNER AND HIS BROKEN ENGLISH THAT I FELT MY HEART
BUT HE IS SAVING US I SAID TAKING US TO OUR FRIENDS JIMMY NO KNOW JIMMY TINK DOCTOR SOMEWHERE RIGHT LONG BIG HILL GIB BLACK WHITE FELLOW TOPPER TOPPER MAKE UM TINK MORE
AS HE UNCLOSED HIS EYES AND STARED FIRST UP AT THE CEILING AND THEN ABOUT HIM TILL HIS EYES RESTED UPON US WHEN HE SMILED AM I MUCH HURT HE SAID IN A LOW CALM VOICE OH NO SAID THE DOCTOR
AND USED THEIR WAR CLUBS IN THE MOST GALLANT MANNER JIMMY TOO SEEMED TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO AS BRAVE A BLACK WARRIOR AS EVER FOUGHT AND IT WAS THE GALLANT RESISTANCE OFFERED
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO HOW WE HEARD A BLACK DISCUSSION AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE RESCUE PARTY CONSISTED OF THE DOCTOR
AND PRESSED IT SILENTLY TO CALL MY ATTENTION TO OUR BLACK FOLLOWERS WHO WERE LAYING THEIR BOWS AND ARROWS REGULARLY IN COMPANY WITH THEIR WADDIES EACH MAN LOOKING VERY STERN AND GRAVE
MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN RUNNING TO AND FRO AS IF WILD NOW WOULD BE THE TIME SAID THE DOCTOR WE MIGHT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CONFUSION AND GET YOUR FATHER AWAY YES I CRIED EXCITEDLY
I THOUGHT I SHOULD FIND YOU HERE HE SAID AND I CAME ON THINKING THAT PERHAPS I COULD HELP YOU HELP US YES OF COURSE YOU CAN YOU SHALL HELP US TO GET MISTER CARSTAIRS AWAY
WITH A WONDERFUL DISPLAY OF ACTIVITY WHICH RESULTED MERELY IN HIS SLIPPING BACK THEN HE TRIED ELSEWHERE IN TWO PLACES BUT WITH THE SAME RESULT AND AFTER A FEW MORE TRIALS
AND TO MY GREAT JOY I FELT MORE MYSELF AT LAST AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF INCOMPREHENSIBLE CHATTER IT SEEMED THAT A DECISION HAD BEEN COME TO ABOUT ME
HERE LET ME HELP YOU SAID THE DOCTOR HOLDING OUT HIS HAND YES SAID JIMMY DRAWING HIS WADDY AND BOOMERANG FROM HIS BELT HOLD UM TIGHT UM ALL IN BLACK FELLOW WAY
AFTER A CONTEMPTUOUS LOOK AT THE BLACKS WHO WERE CALMLY AWAITING THEIR FATE
TANTALISING ME SO THAT I GRASPED HIS ARM EXCLAIMING FIERCELY SPEAK ENGLISH WHERE IS MY FATHER I COULD HARDLY SEE HIS FACE BUT THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO TELL THAT HE TURNED TOWARDS ME AND HE STOPPED SPEAKING
OF OUR ENEMIES AND WE GAZED EXCITEDLY DOWN THE GORGE AND THEN AT EACH OTHER JACK PENNY SHUDDERING AND TURNING AWAY HIS HEAD
IT WAS WITH THE FEELING THAT WE WERE NEVER LIKELY TO SEE THE THINGS AGAIN
AND LEAVE HIM WHOM I HAD COME TO SEEK BEHIND THEN COMMON SENSE STEPPED IN AND MADE ME KNOW THAT IT WAS FOLLY TO STAY WHILE JIMMY SUPPLEMENTED THESE THOUGHTS BY SAYING
AT MY HEAD IF THAT BLOW HAD TAKEN EFFECT I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL
THE DOCTOR MOTIONED US TO KEEP AWAY AND WE ALL WENT TO THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK OVER THE NIGHT'S ADVENTURE THE CONVERSATION CHANGING AT TIMES TO A DISCUSSION OF OUR FRIEND'S MENTAL AFFECTION
DISTORT EVERYTHING NEAR AT HAND HERE HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE AND BENDING DOWN WE ALL LISTENED TO HIS WORDS WHICH CAME FEEBLY CONSEQUENT UPON HIS EXERTIONS I HAVE BEEN TO THE FAR HUT
I FORGET I CANNOT SPEAK SOMETIMES I CANNOT THINK IT IS ALL DARK HERE HERE IN MY MIND WHY HAVE YOU COME WE ARE FRIENDS SAID THE DOCTOR WHERE IS MISTER CARSTAIRS
ALL TOP HERE JIMMY GO SEE I QUITE SHARED WITH THE DOCTOR THE FEELING OF HELPLESS ANNOYANCE AT HAVING TO DEPEND SO MUCH ON THE BLACK
THE NOISE WAS NOT SO GREAT THOUGH NOW THAT WE COULD NOT TALK AND AFTER RECOVERING FROM THE APPALLING SHOCK OF THE NEW DANGER WE HAD TIME TO LOOK AROUND OUR FIRST THOUGHT WAS
NO WATER GO DOWN HE SAID MASS JOE MASS JACK DOCTOR
THEN BY DEGREES IT CREPT ON AND ON TILL I WAS STANDING WITH IT REACHING MY HIPS A FEARFUL SILENCE NOW ENSUED AND THE THOUGHT CAME UPON ME
ONCE MORE THERE SEEMED TO RISE UP BEFORE ME OUR QUIET PEACEFUL HOME NEAR SYDNEY
AND I READ IN HIS FACE THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THE SLIGHTEST HOPE I LOOKED AT JACK PENNY WHO WAS DEEPLY INTENT UPON A LITTLE BLUE ANCHOR THAT SOME BUSH SHEPHERD HAD TATTOOED UPON HIS THIN WHITE ARM THEN I TURNED TO JIMMY
HE HAD OBTAINED FROM OUR GUIDE THE LATTER CHECKED HIM THOUGH LAYING A HAND UPON HIS ARM AS HE SAID TO ME AFTER LISTENING INTENTLY YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT THESE PEOPLE ARE TOO STRONG YOU MUST ESCAPE
WHEN NO WATER BIG SWIM MANY HAD BEEN THE TIMES WHEN JIMMY AND I HAD DASHED INTO THE RIVER AND SWUM ABOUT BY THE HOUR TOGETHER
BUT THOUGH THE MOVEMENT AMONG THE BUSHES WAS PLAIN ENOUGH I ONLY CAUGHT ONE GLIMPSE OF A BLACK BODY AND HAD I BEEN DISPOSED TO SHOOT IT WAS TOO QUICK FOR ME AND WAS GONE IN AN INSTANT
BLACK FELLOW COME ALONG HE CAUGHT MY ARM AND FOLLOWING OUR GUIDE WE HURRIED ON THROUGH THE DARKNESS WHICH WAS SO DENSE THAT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE WONDERFUL EYESIGHT OF MY BLACK COMPANION A FACULTY WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED
FOR HE ROSE FROM WHERE HE HAD BEEN SEATED AND TOOK MY HAND QUITE RIGHT MY LAD HE SAID ONE MUST NEVER SAY DESPAIR THERE'S A LEDGE
I WAS SURE THEY SAW US AND WITH A WORD OF WARNING TO THE DOCTOR I TURNED AND SHOULD HAVE FLED BUT FOR TWO HANDS THAT WERE LAID UPON MY SHOULDERS PRESSING ME DOWN THE DOCTOR CROUCHING LIKEWISE
AND MORE STERN THAN THE OTHERS WHICH WERE SILENCED AND AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO WE HEARD OUR FRIEND THE ENGLISHMAN RESPOND IN A DEPRECATING VOICE AND APPARENTLY PLEAD FOR MERCY
AS I FULLY REALISED THE FACT THAT THEY HAD BEEN COMPLETELY SWEPT AWAY THERE COULD NOT BE A MOMENT'S DOUBT OF THAT
HOLDING TIGHTLY BY THE DOCTOR ON ONE SIDE BY JIMMY ON THE OTHER AND IN ANOTHER MINUTE I KNEW THAT THE RISING WATER WOULD BE AT MY LIPS I REMEMBER GIVING A CURIOUS GASP AS IF MY BREATH WAS GOING
BEING HURRIED ALONG AND PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF A CROWD OF THE SAVAGES ALL OF WHOM SEEMED TO BE ROLLING THEIR EYES AND LOOKING AT ME AS IF ENJOYING MY POSITION WELL I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
AND TO SET MY BRAIN AT WORK SCHEMING IT SEEMED TO GROW DARKER JUST THEN THE STARS FADING OUT BEHIND A THICK VEIL OF CLOUDS AND CREEPING NEARER TO THE DOCTOR I SAT DOWN BESIDE WHERE HE KNELT
FOR I WAS WEARY OF WAITING FOR OPPORTUNITIES FAST ASLEEP POOR FELLOW HE WHISPERED COMING BACK SO SILENTLY THAT HE STARTLED ME WHERE'S THE BLACK
AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT MORE OF THIS HORRIBLE BLOODSHED MUST ENSUE WE WERE CROUCHING CLOSE BUT THE WOUNDED MAN WAS MOANING AND HIS COMPANIONS MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT HEAR HIM AND THEN DISCOVERY MUST FOLLOW
THE POOR DAZED CREATURE TURNED TO THE DOCTOR NOW AND BENT TOWARDS HIM HOLDING HIM BY THE ARM THIS TIME CHIEF'S HUT YES RIGHT ACROSS
IT WOULD BE OVER THE LEDGE I WAS NOTING TOO THAT NOW
THAT WHEN THE FINAL STRUGGLE WAS AT HAND WE SHOULD BE SO CLASPED TOGETHER THAT SWIMMING WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AND WE MUST ALL BE DROWNED AND NOW ONCE MORE WITH THE WATER RISING STEADILY
WHO AFTER A TIME CAME UNWILLINGLY FROM THEIR LOWER POSITION SPLASHING MOURNFULLY THROUGH THE WATER BUT EVIDENTLY UNWILLING EVEN THEN TO DISOBEY THEIR WHITE LEADER THEY GROUPED THEMSELVES
AND PRETTY SWIFTLY THEN THE HARDY LIFE I HAD LED OUT IN THE BUSH WITH JIMMY FOR MY COMPANION HAD MADE ME LIGHT OF FOOT AND TOLERABLY ENDURING
WE WERE HURRYING ON ALL THIS TIME ENTIRELY UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE STRANGE BEING WHO HAD SET US FREE BUT NOT WITHOUT PROTESTS FROM THE BLACK WHO WAS GROWING JEALOUS OF OUR GUIDE AND WHO KEPT ON WHISPERING
I WAS EITHER TO TIE SOMETHING TO HIS COLLAR OR TAKE IT OFF DO NEITHER SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY LOOK THEY ARE LIGHTING A FIRE THE OTHERS MUST HAVE COME BACK
LIKE THE BLACK AGAINST BULLETS WHICH HE SAID CAME TOO MUCH FASTER FASTER TO TOP AND AS THE SAVAGE MADE THE BLOW AT ME I FOLLOWED OUT JIMMY'S TACTICS THREW MYSELF FORWARD
BULLET RIGHT THROUGH THE SHOULDER SAID THE DOCTOR IN A SHORT ABRUPT MANNER AND AS HE SPOKE HE RAPIDLY TORE UP HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND PLUGGED AND BOUND THE WOUND SUPPLEMENTING THE HANDKERCHIEF WITH A LONG SCARF WHICH HE WORE ROUND THE WAIST
JIMMY STOOPED DOWN EXASPERATING ME THE WHILE BY GRINNING AS IF IT WAS GOOD FUN TILL THE SUFFERER FROM OUR MISTAKE WAS PLACED UPON HIS BACK WHEN HE EXCLAIMED LOT MUCH HEAVY HEAVY TWICE TWO SHEEP HEAVY
BUT I COULD NOT HELP IT JACK'S ASPECT AS HE SAT THERE COOLLY VERY COOLLY CLOTHED IN HIS TROUSERS ALONE WAS SO LUDICROUS THAT I BURST OUT LAUGHING WHEN JIMMY JOINED IN AND BEGAN TO DANCE WITH DELIGHT
AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JIMMY BUT TURNING MY HEAD
WAS TAKEN OFF POUND BY POUND AND BEFORE WE COULD REALISE THE TRUTH THE WATER WAS AT MY KNEES TEN MINUTES LATER IT WAS AT MY FEET AND BEFORE HALF AN HOUR HAD PASSED
AND I FOUND THAT WE WERE IN THE SHADOW CAST BY A LONG HUT WHOSE BACK WAS WITHIN A YARD OR SO OF OUR FEET JIMMY PLACED HIS LIPS CLOSE TO MY EAR THEN TO THE DOCTOR'S AND TO EACH OF US HE WHISPERED SOON GO SLEEP SLEEP
NO GO NO FARRER MASS JOE JIMMY FINE A DOCTOR AN MASS JACK PENNY HI COME ALONG JIMMY NOW HE WAS JUST REPEATING THIS IN MY EAR WHEN WE WERE HURRYING ON FASTER
AND SOMEHOW IT SEEMED THAT THEY DESERVED IT THEN I BEGAN THINKING OF MY OWN FRIENDS AND THEN VERY SELFISHLY NO DOUBT ABOUT MYSELF BUT I HAD LITTLE TIME FOR THOUGHT
I WHISPERED ONCE OR TWICE TO THE DOCTOR BUT HE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY LIPS I TURNED TO JIMMY BUT HE HAD CROUCHED DOWN AND WAS RESTING HIMSELF ACCORDING TO HIS HABIT
NO I EXCLAIMED DELIGHTED AT THIS TURN IN OUR AFFAIRS JIMMY HELPED ME TO ESCAPE I SAY YOU DON'T THINK I RAN AWAY AND DESERTED YOU MY DEAR BOY HE CRIED I WAS AFRAID THAT YOU WOULD THINK THIS OF ME
THE SHOCK OF THE WOUND HAS AFFECTED HIS HEAD BENEFICIALLY IT SEEMS THE DOCTOR SAID AT LAST WHETHER IT WILL LAST I CANNOT SAY
TO LEFT TO RIGHT AND IN FRONT THE SWOLLEN RUSHING TORRENT THE DOCTOR STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT THE WATER FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN TURNED TO ME HOW HIGH ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WERE WE DO YOU THINK WHEN WE CAME HERE
LISTENING TO THE INCESSANT TALKING OF THE SAVAGES
CHAPTER THIRTY NINE HOW WE TOOK A LAST LOOK ROUND AND FOUND IT WAS TIME TO GO THAT NEXT EVENING SEEMED AS IT WOULD NEVER COME
MY SPIRITS ROSE THEN AT THESE THOUGHTS AND I RAPIDLY THREW OFF PART OF MY CLOTHES
EVERY ACT AT FIRST I HAD FELT NUMBED AND COLD MY LEGS AND ARMS ACHED AND WHEN THE BLACKS TOOK OFF THE ROPE THAT THEY HAD BOUND ABOUT MY LIMBS
I WON'T FIRE IT OFF AGAIN I WAS VERY NEARLY MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE I SAID OUT OF COMPASSION FOR JACK PENNY HE SEEMED SO MUCH DISTRESSED
AND AS WE ENTERED I LOOKED ROUND AGAIN TO CATCH SIGHT OF ANOTHER BLACK FIGURE CROUCHING FAR UP THE OPPOSITE BANK AT THE FOOT OF A GREAT TREE I DID NOT SPEAK FOR IT WAS BETTER THAT THE BLACK SHOULD NOT THINK HE HAD BEEN SEEN
CLAPPING ME ON THE SHOULDER AND TURNING SHARPLY I SAW THE MEANING OF THE PROLONGATION OF THE THUNDER FOR A GREAT WAVE AT LEAST TEN FEET HIGH RUDDY FOAMING AND FULL OF TOSSING BRANCHES CAME RUSHING DOWN THE GORGE
WITH HIS LIPS TO MY EAR THE STORM HIGH UP THE MOUNTAINS FLOOD THE GORGE JUST THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER CRASHING PEAL OF THUNDER CLOSE UPON A FLASH OF LIGHTNING AND THE HISSING RAIN CEASED AS IF BY MAGIC
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE WE AWAIT OUR FATE I GLANCED FROM THE BLACKS TO THE DOCTOR TO SEE THAT HE WAS INTENTLY GAZING UP THE GORGE WHERE THE RUSHING WATER CAME SEETHING DOWN
AND CAME TO ME WAGGING HIS TAIL AND UTTERING A SHARP BARK OR TWO
FOR I KNEW HE FELT THAT IT WAS HOPELESS BUT ALL THE SAME HE GRANTED THAT IT WAS OUR DUTY TO TRY THE DOCTOR NOW BENT DOWN OVER THE WATER AND I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS RISING FASTER THAN EVER
HE WENT TO THE EDGE OF THE SHELF AND DIPPED ONE FOOT IN THE WATER THEN THE OTHER
I'M READY STOP FOR YOUR LIVES SAID A VOICE AT OUR ELBOW AND TURNING I SAW MISTER FRANCIS WITH HIS SWARTHY FACE LIT UP BY THE FIRE YOU COULD NOT GET NEAR THE HUT NOW WITHOUT BEING SEEN
SMELL UM BLACK FELLOW ONE EYE PEEPING ROUND UM TREES YES WE HAVE SEEN THEM TOO I SAID
WHO HAD BEEN FIERCE AND ANGRY SNAPPING AND BARKING FURIOUSLY AT THE SAVAGES EACH TIME THEY CHARGED SUDDENLY THREW UP HIS HEAD AND UTTERED A DISMAL HOWL HERE YOU HOLD YOUR NOISE CRIED JACK PENNY
WITH A FEW SILVERY CLOUDS FLOATING AWAY IN THE REAR OF THE STORM WHILE THE SUN SHONE DOWN GLORIOUSLY IT SEEMED TOO HARD TO BEAR
ONLY THAT THE NOISE OF THE THUNDER STILL SEEMED TO CONTINUE AND GROW INTO A SOUND LIKE A FIERCE RUSH BUT THIS WAS NOTHING NEW THE THUNDER HAD BEEN GOING ON BEFORE AND THAT
HIM EAT PIECE JIMMY ALL UP LEGGUM CRIED THE BLACK HERE GYP I CRIED AS THE DOG STOPPED HIS WHINING CRY OF PLEASURE BUT GROWLED ONCE MORE HERE I SAID THIS IS A FRIEND PAT HIS HEAD SIR AND
WE COULD NOT TELL FOR HOW LONG WHILE ON TAKING A HASTY GLANCE AT OUR POSITION IT WAS THIS OVERHEAD THE SHELVING ROCK QUITE IMPASSABLE
AND ON PARTING THE BOUGHS AND TWIGS WE BOTH STARTED BACK IN HORROR MY BOY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE CRIED THE DOCTOR AS I STOOD SPEECHLESS THERE BY HIS SIDE WE HAVE NOT SO MANY FRIENDS THAT WE COULD AFFORD TO KILL THEM
BUT ONLY TO BE SHAMED OUT OF ANY FRANTIC DISPLAY OF GRIEF BY THE STOICAL CALMNESS WITH WHICH ALL SEEMED TO BE PREPARING TO MEET THEIR FATE
AND SO LIKE DID IT ALL SEEM TO THE LAST TIME THAT NO TIME MIGHT HAVE ELAPSED SINCE WE CROUCHED THERE BREATHING HEAVILY WITH EXCITEMENT
I TURNED AGHAST TO THE DOCTOR AND THEN MADE AS IF TO RUN EXPECTING THAT THE NEXT MOMENT WE SHOULD BE SWEPT AWAY BUT HE CAUGHT ME BY THE ARM WITH A GRIP LIKE IRON STAND STILL HE ROARED
BUT ALREADY HE WAS BUSY FEELING THE FOLLY OF WASTING WORDS AND DOWN UPON HIS KNEES TO PLACE THE HEAD OF OUR FRIEND THE PRISONER OF THE SAVAGES IN A MORE COMFORTABLE POSITION BEFORE BEGINNING TO EXAMINE HIM FOR HIS WOUND
WHOSE HAND NOW MOVED FROM MY SHOULDER TO MY LIPS I DREW A BREATH FULL OF RELIEF THE NEXT MOMENT FOR IN PLACE OF DASHING DOWN UPON US THE BLACKS RUSHED INTO THE HUT BEHIND WHICH WE WERE STANDING CROWDING IT
CASTING GLANCES BEHIND ME FROM TIME TO TIME AND SEEING THAT
FOR A FRESH WAVE THE RESULT PROBABLY OF SOME PORTION OF THE FLOOD THAT HAD BEEN DAMMED UP HIGHER ON THE RIVER COURSE
THEN THE CHIEF SAVAGE SPOKE AGAIN IN STERN TONES THERE WAS A BUZZ OF VOICES ONCE MORE AND THE SAVAGES SEEMED TO FILE OUT AND CROSS THE OPENING TOWARDS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VILLAGE
THAT THIS WAS HE WHOM I SOUGHT BUT TERRIBLY CHANGED HE SAID SOMETHING IN REPLY IN THE SAVAGE TONGUE STOPPED AND THEN WENT ON I FORGET I DON'T KNOW
GO ON THEN I SAID WITH A GROAN OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND MISTER FRANCIS TOOK THE LEAD ONCE MORE AND THE DOCTOR FOLLOWING I WAS LAST BUT JIMMY I SAID
WHERE EVEN A BIRD COULD CLIMB AND IN DESPAIR I TOO BEGAN TO STRIP OFF SOME OF MY CLOTHES ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO SWIM SAID THE DOCTOR GRAVELY I NODDED
JUST THEN I HEARD A VOICE IN THE HUT WHICH MADE ME START WITH JOY THEN THERE WAS A RUSTLING SOUND AND JIMMY CAME ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HUT ALL RIGHTUMS HE WHISPERED
BUT THERE THANK HEAVEN YOU ARE SAFE AND THOUGH WE HAVE NOT RESCUED YOUR FATHER WE KNOW ENOUGH TO MAKE SUCCESS CERTAIN I'M AFRAID NOT I SAID HASTILY THE SAVAGES HAVE DISCOVERED OUR HIDING PLACE NO
I WAS PANTING HEAVILY AND A CHOKING SENSATION CAME UPON ME BUT I RACED ON SINCE IT WAS FOR LIFE HOW LONG THE PURSUIT LASTED I CANNOT TELL PERHAPS A MINUTE
HE HAS GONE ON IN FRONT I THOUGHT AND ONCE MORE I TRAMPED WEARILY ON
BUT I CAN SEE NONE UNLESS THE WATER SINKS WE ARE LOST JOE MY LAD YOU MUST ACT LIKE A MAN I'LL TRY DOCTOR I SAID IN A CHOKING VOICE AND AS I SPOKE
CAN WE DO ANYTHING DOCTOR I SAID AT LAST IN A LOW AWE STRICKEN VOICE HE GAZED AT ME TENDERLY AND HELD OUT HIS HAND TO PRESS MINE WHEN I LAID IT IN HIS GRASP
I THINK HE WILL DO NOW TWO INCHES LOWER MASTER PENNY AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEAD MAN I COULDN'T HELP IT DRAWLED JACK PENNY I THOUGHT HE WAS A SAVAGE COMING TO KILL US I'M ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING
GLIDING SILENTLY THROUGH THE FOREST FOR QUITE THREE HOURS WHEN MISTER FRANCIS STOPPED AND IT WAS DECIDED TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES A LITTLE BEFORE PROCEEDING FARTHER THE DOCTOR HAD SETTLED
NOT DIE YET WHILE JIMMY NOT GO DIE
GREAT TUPID GO DIE WHEN QUITE WELL TANK YOU MASS JOE JIMMY BLACK FELLOW WON'T DIE YET MASS JOE HAB BIG SWIM LONG O JIMMY
THAT'S RIGHT HE SAID I SHALL DO THE SAME WE MIGHT REACH SOME LEDGE LOWER DOWN HE SAID THAT WORD MIGHT WITH A SLOW
I COULD NOT EVEN MAKE OUT THE TREE WHERE JIMMY HAD BEEN TIED ALL AT ONCE A SENSATION AS OF PANIC SEIZED ME FOR THE GROUP OF BLACKS SET UP A LOUD SHOUT AND CAME RUNNING TOWARDS WHERE WE WERE
AND CLAMBER BEYOND THE REACH OF THE RUSHING TORRENT BUT NO
I EXCHANGED GLANCES WITH THE DOCTOR WHO SIGNED TO ME TO BE SILENT IT WAS A VERY HARD ONE VERY HARD THE WOUNDED MAN CONTINUED AND THEN HE STOPPED SHORT
HE WAS GONE WHAT IS IT WHISPERED THE DOCTOR AND I TOLD HIM THE DOCTOR DREW HIS PISTOL I HEARD HIM IN THE DARKNESS AND GRASPED MY ARM AS IF TO BE READY FOR FLIGHT BUT
BUT A SIGHT OF THE CALM RESIGNATION OF MY COMPANIONS DAMPED ME AGAIN TILL JIMMY ONCE MORE SPOKE MASS JOE TAKE OFF CLOSUMS PUT LONG GUN UP IN CORNER COME AND FETCH UM
AND THEN I JOINED THE DOCTOR IN SEARCHING
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE SAVAGES HAD QUITTED THE HUT IN THIS BELIEF I LAID MY HAND UPON THE DOCTOR'S ARM AND WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WHEN CLOSE BY US AS IT SEEMED
AND STEPPING MORE CAUTIOUSLY WE WERE SOON CLOSE UP BEHIND A GREAT HUT THIS IS THE PLACE WHISPERED MISTER FRANCIS HE IS KEPT PRISONER HERE OR ELSE AT THE GREAT HUT ON THE OTHER SIDE HIST
STILL THE WATER ROSE STEADILY HIGHER AND HIGHER INCH BY INCH
THE DULL BOOM OF THE TREMENDOUS WAVE HAD PASSED TOO BUT THE RIVER HISSED AND ROARED AS IT TORE ALONG BENEATH OUR FEET AND IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT IT WAS RISING HIGHER STILL
HOW TIGHTLY PROBABLY THEY NEVER KNEW THEN I REMEMBER THAT MY HEAD SUDDENLY SEEMED TO GROW CLEAR
AND GYP MADE A BOUND FROM MY SIDE INTO THE DARKNESS LEAVING US ALONE
AND THEN THERE WAS A FAINT SOUND OF RUSTLING WITH THE CRACKING NOISE MADE BY A JOINT AS IF SOME ONE HAD RISEN TO A STANDING POSITION WERE THE SAVAGES COMING ROUND TO OUR SIDE AND ABOUT TO LEAP UPON US
CRACKS AND POINTS OF ROCK THAT WE HAD BEFORE NOTICED DISAPPEARING ENTIRELY TILL THE FLOWING EARTH STAINED SURFACE WAS BUT A FEW INCHES BELOW THE LEDGE
BETTER THE LONG ANXIETY I THOUGHT OF WATCHING AND WAITING FOR MY RETURN THAN TO KNOW I HAD BEEN KILLED LIKE THIS BUT I'M NOT KILLED YET I THOUGHT AS THE BLOOD FLUSHED TO MY FACE
BUT THEY DID NOT STIR THEY REMAINED WITH THEIR POSITIONS UNALTERED AND STILL THE WATER ADVANCED
TO BE SMOOTHED AND FOLDED AND LAID UPON THE JACKET AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I THOROUGHLY REALISED HOW EXCESSIVELY THIN POOR JACK PENNY WAS AND THE REASON WHY
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY EVIL WILL RESULT FROM IT HIST HE IS COMING TO OUR CONVERSATION HAD BEEN CARRIED ON IN A WHISPER AND WE NOW STOPPED SHORT AND WATCHED THE DOCTOR'S PATIENT IN THE DIM TWILIGHT OF THE CAVERN
THAT MY PURSUERS WERE AS SWIFT OF FOOT AND THAT THOUGH I WAS CLOSE UPON
WHERE HE BENT DOWN AND CRAWLED IN ON HANDS AND KNEES WAITING TILL HIS BURDEN WAS REMOVED FROM HIS BACK AND THEN GETTING UP ONCE MORE TO LOOK ROUND SMILING JIMMY CARRY LOT O MEN LIKE THAT WAY
AND NOW RISING INTO QUITE AN ANGRY SHOUT NOW DESCENDING INTO A LOW BUZZ THE TALK TALK TALK WENT ON AS IF THEY WERE SAYING THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
TO SEE CRACK AND CREVICE GRADUALLY FILL AND POINT AFTER POINT COVERED BY THE SEETHING WATER WHICH CREPT UP SLOWLY AND INSIDIOUSLY HIGHER AND HIGHER EVEN AS WE WATCHED YES SAID THE DOCTOR
THAN WHEN WE STARTED YES I SAID BUT BUT NONSENSE BOY WHY WE'VE FOUND YOUR FATHER WE KNOW WHERE HE IS AND IF WE CAN'T GET HIM AWAY BY STRATAGEM
BUT I HAD GREAT FAITH IN JIMMY'S HEARING FOR IN OLD TIMES HE HAD GIVEN ME SOME REMARKABLE INSTANCES OF THE ACUTENESS OF THIS SENSE
STOPPED SHORT ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY UP THE NARROW SLOPE THAT LED TO OUR LITTLE FORT AND THEN WITH A SHRIEK OF DISMAY TURNED AND BEGAN TO RETREAT I STARED AFTER THEM
JIMMY WENT ON GYP KEEPING CLOSE TO HIS HEELS NOW AS IF HE QUITE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT BEING SEEN WE HAD LEFT THE DENSE FOREST AND WERE WALKING IN A MORE OPEN PART AMONG TALL TREES
IT IS A SIGNAL FOR US TO COME BACK HOW DO YOU KNOW WE AGREED UPON IT I SAID HE WAS TO SEND THE DOG IN SEARCH OF US IF WE DID NOT JOIN HIM IN TWO HOURS AND IF WE WERE IN TROUBLE
AT LEAST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE DOCTOR WAS SAYING THOSE OR SIMILAR WORDS FROM OUT OF A MIST AND THEN ALL WAS SILENT
AND ALL THIS WHILE THE TALKING WENT ON RISING AND FALLING TILL IT SEEMED ALMOST MADDENING TO HEAR WE MUST HAVE WAITED THERE QUITE A COUPLE OF HOURS AND STILL THERE WAS NO CHANGE
AND HIS VOICE SOUNDED HOLLOW AND STRANGE GYP UTTERED A WHINE THAT DOG HAD BEEN SO WELL TRAINED THAT HE RARELY BARKED RAN QUICKLY UP THE FURTHER BANK OF THE RIVULET
HE STARTED AND LOOKED IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS I DID WHICH WAS RIGHT DOWN THE GULLY AND SAW WHAT HAD TAKEN MY ATTENTION NAMELY THE STOOPING BODIES OF A COUPLE OF BLACKS HURRYING AWAY THROUGH THE BUSHES AT A PRETTY GOOD RATE
AND WHEN THIS HAD GONE BY THERE WAS
TUPID WHITE FELLOW ALL A SAME MUD IN UM HEAD HE SEEMS STRANGE IN HIS HEAD I SAID YES ISS MAD MAD NO WASH UM HEAD CLEAN CAN'T TINK STRAIGHT UP
OH YOU MEANT WHAT YOU DID FOR THE BEST SAID THE DOCTOR LAYING HIS HAND ON JACK PENNY'S SHOULDER WHAT DID HE WANT TO LOOK LIKE A SAVAGE FOR GRUMBLED JACK WHO WAS GOING TO KNOW THAT ANY ONE DRESSED UP
BUT SOMEHOW I DID NOT FEEL AS IF I REPENTED OF COMING SAVE WHEN I THOUGHT THAT MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE TWO SORROWS NOW WHEN SHE CAME
OF ALL TIMES WAS THE HOUR FOR THAT SO WE WORKED ON WITH MANY A FURTIVE GLANCE AT THE WATER WHICH KEPT ON ENCROACHING TILL IT BEGAN TO LAP THE FEET OF OUR BLACK COMPANIONS
AS IF IN CHASE OF OUR ENEMIES AND BEFORE I HAD MORE THAN TIME TO REALISE THE DANGER
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED WHY FOR MONKS WAS REALLY OLIVER'S OLDER HALF BROTHER A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE THIS STORY BEGAN OLIVER'S FATHER HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO GO ON A TRIP TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY
AND HIS WHOLE HEART LONGED TO MARRY RACHEL BUT BOUNDERBY TOLD HIM BLUNTLY THAT THE LAW HE HAD IN MIND WAS ONLY FOR RICH MEN WHO COULD AFFORD TO SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND HE FURTHER ADDED ACCORDING TO HIS USUAL CUSTOM
MISTER TULKINGHORN CALLED ON HER AND TOLD HER OF THE UNKNOWN MAN'S DEATH SHE PRETENDED TO LISTEN WITH LITTLE INTEREST BUT HIS TRAINED EYE SAW THAT SHE WAS DEEPLY MOVED BY IT
THERE WAS AN ANGEL'S HALO ABOUT HER HEAD SOON THE WRETCHED CREATURE SHE HAD AIDED PASSED OUT OF HIS DAILY LIFE AGAIN TO GO HE KNEW NOT WHERE AND THIS ACT OF RACHEL'S REMAINED TO MAKE HIS LOVE AND LONGING GREATER
NEXT CARTON BOUGHT A QUANTITY OF A DRUG WHOSE FUMES WOULD RENDER A MAN INSENSIBLE AND WITH THIS IN HIS POCKET EARLY NEXT MORNING HE WENT TO THE SPY BARSAD AND BADE HIM REDEEM HIS PROMISE AND TAKE HIM TO THE CELL WHERE DARNAY WAITED FOR THE SIGNAL OF DEATH
HAD BEEN CALLED TO ATTEND HIM AND SO BY ACCIDENT HAD LEARNED THE WHOLE HORRIFIED AT THE WICKED WRONG HE WROTE OF IT IN A LETTER TO THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE THE MARQUIS WHOM IT ACCUSED LEARNED OF THIS AND
AND THAT HER GRANDFATHER BLAMED HIM AS THE CAUSE OF THEIR MISFORTUNE
HE HAD COME BACK NOW TO ENGLAND A RICH MAN TO FIND THE OTHER HAD VANISHED WITH LITTLE NELL HIS GRANDCHILD HE HAD SOON LEARNED THE STORY OF THEIR MISFORTUNE AND HOW THE FEAR OF QUILP HAD DRIVEN THEM AWAY
THAT I MIGHT NOT SEE HOW LAME SHE WAS
OR STUMBLING AGAINST HIM AND WHEN THIS HAPPENED ONE OF THEM WOULD SLIP A HAND INTO HIS POCKET AND TAKE OUT EITHER THE WATCH OR THE SNUFF BOX OR THE HANDKERCHIEF IF THE JEW FELT A HAND IN HIS POCKET HE CRIED OUT
AND MADE ALL THE CONGREGATION LOOK SURPRISED KIT TOOK HER HOME PACKED HER BOX AND BUNDLED HER INTO THE COACH WHICH THE STRANGER BROUGHT AND AWAY THEY WENT TO FIND THE WANDERERS NOW QUILP HAD ALL ALONG SUSPECTED THAT KIT AND HIS MOTHER
MISSUS SPARSIT FOUND BOUNDERBY AT HIS CITY HOTEL EXPLODED WITH THE COMBUSTIBLE INFORMATION SHE CARRIED AND FAINTED QUITE AWAY ON HIS COAT COLLAR FURIOUS AT THE NEWS SHE BROUGHT BOUNDERBY HUSTLED HER INTO A FAST TRAIN AND TOGETHER
IN ORDER TO GAIN MORE PRIVILEGES AND HIGHER WAGES FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS THIS MOVEMENT IN TIME HAD REACHED COKETOWN
HE MADE HER GIVE HIM THE MONEY SHE HAD EARNED FROM THE WAXWORK JOINED THE GAMBLERS AND IN A FEW HOURS HAD LOST IT ALL HIS INSANITY HAD MADE HIM FORGET THE PRESENCE OF THE CHILD HE SO LOVED AND WHEN THE GAME WAS DONE IT WAS TOO LATE TO LEAVE THE INN THAT NIGHT
WHEN HE MOVED TO GAD'S HILL IT SEEMED AS THOUGH DICKENS HAD GAINED ALMOST ALL OF THE THINGS MEN STRIVE MOST FOR BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE HAPPY THERE NOR PERHAPS WAS HE EVER AGAIN TO BE REALLY HAPPY ANYWHERE
HE LOOKED UP AS THEY CAME NEAR IT WAS THE KIND OLD SCHOOLMASTER IN WHOSE SCHOOL THEY HAD SLEPT BEFORE THEY MET MISSUS JARLEY IN HER HOUSE ON WHEELS WHEN SHE SAW HIM LITTLE NELL SHRIEKED AND FELL UNCONSCIOUS AT HIS FEET
HE THOUGHT AT LAST BUT TO RUN AWAY SO HE TIED UP HIS FEW BELONGINGS IN A HANDKERCHIEF AND WAITING TILL THE FIRST BEAM OF SUNRISE HE UNBARRED THE DOOR
THE LOCKET FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE MISTRESS OF THE POORHOUSE WHO WAS NAMED MISSUS BUMBLE IT CONTAINED THE DEAD MOTHER'S WEDDING RING AND AS MISSUS BUMBLE WAS A DISHONEST WOMAN
AND BEFORE LONG HE FOUND A ROAD THAT HE KNEW LED TO LONDON OLIVER HAD NEVER SEEN A CITY BUT HE THOUGHT WHERE THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE THERE WOULD CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING FOR A BOY TO DO TO EARN HIS LIVING
BOUNDERBY WAS A PRECIOUS HYPOCRITE OF AN ODD SORT
WHICH SEEMED DESTINED NEVER TO END WAS SIR LEICESTER DEDLOCK AND ONE DAY THE CHANCERY COURT HAVING ACTUALLY MADE A LITTLE PROGRESS MISTER TULKINGHORN BROUGHT THE BARONET SOME LEGAL PAPERS TO READ TO HIM AS THE LAWYER HELD ONE IN HIS HAND
MORE THAN ONE WENT SEARCHING EVERYWHERE FOR THEM WITHOUT SUCCESS ONE OF THESE WAS QUILP THE UGLY DWARF HE HAD LOANED THE GRANDFATHER MORE MONEY THAN THE SHOP WOULD BRING
HE DECIDED NOW TO VISIT THIS COUNTRY AND MEET HIS AMERICAN READERS FACE TO FACE HE LANDED AT BOSTON ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WIFE IN EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO AND VISITED MANY OF THE GREATER CITIES OF THE EASTERN STATES
THAT HER GRANDFATHER WAS NOT A THIEF AND THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING WHEN HE STOLE HER MONEY BUT SHE KNEW TOO THAT IF PEOPLE FOUND OUT HE WAS CRAZY THEY WOULD TAKE HIM AWAY FROM HER AND SHUT HIM UP WHERE SHE COULD NOT BE WITH HIM AND OF THIS SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK
DESERTED BY HIS WICKED MOTHER AND BROUGHT UP A VAGABOND BY A DRUNKEN GRANDMOTHER
OLIVER SAW SHE WAS VERY SORRY FOR HIM AND INDEED SHE TOLD HIM SHE WOULD HELP HIM IF SHE COULD BUT THAT THERE WAS NO USE TRYING TO ESCAPE NOW BECAUSE THEY WERE WATCHED ALL THE TIME AND IF HE GOT AWAY SIKES WOULD CERTAINLY KILL HER
WHEN AT LAST SHE FELL ASLEEP SHE WAKED SUDDENLY TO SEE A FIGURE IN THE ROOM SHE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO SCREAM AND LAY VERY STILL AND TREMBLED THE ROBBER SEARCHED HER CLOTHING
TWO PERSONS HOWEVER HAD A SUSPICION OF THE TRUTH ONE OF THESE WAS THE PORTER OF THE BANK WHOSE SUSPICION WAS STRONG THE OTHER WAS LOUISA WHO THOUGH HER LOVE DENIED IT ROOM
SHE HAD PICKED UP A HAT AND INSIDE IT WAS THE NAME STEPHEN BLACKPOOL AN INSTANT LATER A SCREAM BROKE FROM HER LIPS THAT ECHOED OVER THE COUNTRY SIDE
MISTER BUMBLE PICKED UP THE LADLE AND STRUCK OLIVER ON THE HEAD WITH IT THEN HE POUNCED ON HIM AND SHOOK HIM WHEN HE WAS TIRED SHAKING HIM HE DRAGGED HIM AWAY AND SHUT HIM UP IN A DARK ROOM
HE TOLD HIM SIMPLY THAT HE COULD DO SO THROUGH HIS SON TOM THIS WAS ALL HE DIED WHILE THEY BORE HIM HOME HOLDING THE HAND OF RACHEL WHOM HE LOVED STEPHEN'S LAST WORDS HAD TOLD THE TRUTH TO MISTER GRADGRIND
KNOCKED HIM FLAT ON THE FLOOR THE BIG BULLY SCREAMED FOR HELP AND CRIED THAT HE WAS BEING MURDERED SO THAT THE UNDERTAKER AND HIS WIFE CAME RUNNING IN OLIVER TOLD THEM WHAT THE APPRENTICE HAD SAID BUT THAT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
HE HAD A DRESS OF LITTLE NELL'S IN HIS HAND AND SMOOTHED AND PATTED IT AS HE MUTTERED THAT SHE HAD BEEN ASLEEP ASLEEP A LONG TIME NOW AND WAS MARBLE COLD AND WOULD NOT WAKE
HOWEVER HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WAS THE FACE OF A THIEF AND REFUSED TO APPEAR AGAINST HIM BUT THE MAGISTRATE WAS IN A BAD HUMOR AND WAS ABOUT TO SENTENCE OLIVER TO PRISON ANYWAY
AFTER HE WAS RELEASED HE JOINED HIS WICKED SISTER SALLY AND THE TWO SANK LOWER AND LOWER TILL THEY MIGHT EVEN BE SEEN ON DARK NIGHTS ON NARROW LONDON STREETS SEARCHING IN REFUSE BOXES FOR BITS OF FOOD LIKE TWIN SPIRITS OF WICKEDNESS AND CRIME
AS THE YEARS WENT BY HIS LETTERS TO HIS OLDEST SON TOLD OF HIS OWN WORK AND PLANS WHEN HIS YOUNGEST SON SAILED AWAY TO LIVE IN AUSTRALIA HE WROTE POOR PLORN IS GONE IT WAS A HARD PARTING AT THE LAST
WHICH IT WAS AND THEN THE GAME BEGAN ALL OVER AGAIN AT LAST FAGIN MADE OLIVER TRY IF HE COULD TAKE SOMETHING OUT OF HIS POCKET WITHOUT HIS KNOWING IT AND WHEN OLIVER SUCCEEDED HE PATTED HIS HEAD AND SEEMED WELL PLEASED
HE DISAPPEARED THAT NIGHT AND LATER SISSY TOLD HIS FATHER WHAT SHE HAD DONE MISTER GRADGRIND WITH SISSY AND LOUISA FOLLOWED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE INTENDING TO GET HIS SON TO THE NEAREST SEAPORT AND SO OUT OF THE COUNTRY ON A VESSEL
TO SAVE HIMSELF HE HAD TO PROMISE NEXT DAY DARNAY WAS TRIED FOR THE SECOND TIME WHEN THE JUDGE ASKED FOR THE ACCUSATION DEFARGE LAID A PAPER BEFORE HIM
THE MAN WHO HAD FALLEN SO LOW AS TO DRAG OUT A WRETCHED EXISTENCE BY COPYING LAW PAPERS WHOM UNTIL SHE SAW THE HANDWRITING IN THE LAWYER'S HANDS SHE HAD BELIEVED TO BE DEAD WAS A MAN LADY DEDLOCK HAD ONCE LOVED
TO PUT DOCTOR MANETTE OUT OF THE WAY HAD HIM ARRESTED SECRETLY TAKEN FROM HIS WIFE AND BABY DAUGHTER
HE TOLD HOW HE HAD YEARS BEFORE RENOUNCED HIS FAMILY AND TITLE LEFT FRANCE AND SUPPORTED HIMSELF RATHER THAN BE A BURDEN ON THE PEASANTRY HE TOLD HOW HE HAD MARRIED A WOMAN OF FRENCH BIRTH THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE GOOD DOCTOR MANETTE
THREW ALL WHO BORE NOBLE NAMES OR TITLES INTO DUNGEONS AND AS THEY HAD PLANNED SET UP A GOVERNMENT OF THEIR OWN DARNAY SAFE IN LONDON WITH LUCIE KNEW LITTLE AND THOUGHT LESS OF ALL THIS
AS THE ONE WHO HAD BROUGHT OLIVER SAT ABOUT A TABLE SMOKING PIPES LIKE ROUGH GROWN MEN OLIVER'S GUIDE INTRODUCED HIM TO THE JEW WHOSE NAME WAS FAGIN
STEPHEN BLACKPOOL THE MILL WORKER WAS ON TRIAL IT WAS A TIME OF GREAT DISSATISFACTION AMONG WORKMEN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
WHICH HE CONCEALED IN THE CELL WALL DENOUNCING THE FAMILY OF EVREMONDE AND ALL THEIR DESCENDANTS THE READING OF THIS PAPER BY DEFARGE AS MAY BE GUESSED AROUSED ALL THE MURDEROUS PASSIONS OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COURT ROOM
THERE UNDER THE TREES STOOD HARTHOUSE HIS HORSE TIED NEAR BY
TOWARD WHATEVER NEW LOT THE FUTURE HELD FOR HIM TOM'S PLOT WORKED WELL NEXT DAY THERE WAS A SENSATION IN COKETOWN BOUNDERBY'S BANK WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN ROBBED
IT WAS THIS A WICKED MAN SO WICKED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF THUNDER WHO WENT BY THE NAME OF MONKS HAD COME TO HIM AND TOLD HIM HE WOULD PAY A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
OH MY CHILD MY CHILD NOT DEAD IN THE FIRST HOURS OF HER LIFE AS MY CRUEL SISTER TOLD ME BUT STERNLY NURTURED BY HER AFTER SHE HAD RENOUNCED ME AND MY NAME
WHOM THEY CALLED THE ARTFUL DODGER CAME IN AND GAVE THE JEW SOME POCKETBOOKS AND HANDKERCHIEFS OLIVER THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE MADE THE POCKETBOOKS ONLY THEY DID NOT LOOK NEW AND SOME SEEMED TO HAVE MONEY IN THEM
BUT HE THOUGHT THE FACT THAT HE HIMSELF HAD REFUSED TO BE ONE OF THEM AND HAD GIVEN HIS SYMPATHY RATHER TO THE PEOPLE THEY OPPRESSED WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OBTAIN GABELLE'S RELEASE
AND THE LETTER HAD BEEN THE LOST CLUE SO LONG SOUGHT TO THEIR HIDING PLACE SNOW BEGAN FALLING AS THE DAYLIGHT WORE AWAY AND THE COACH WHEELS MADE NO NOISE ALL NIGHT AND ALL THE NEXT DAY THEY RODE AND IT WAS MIDNIGHT BEFORE THEY CAME TO THE TOWN
A GREAT BANQUET OF FAREWELL WAS GIVEN TO HIM IN NEW YORK AND HE RETURNED TO ENGLAND BEARING THE ADMIRATION AND LOVE OF THE WHOLE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEFORE LEAVING ENGLAND HE HAD PROMISED TO GIVE ONE OTHER COURSE OF READINGS THERE AND THIS PROMISE
THEN HE WOULD BEGIN THE ALPHABET ALL OVER AGAIN LITTLE OLIVER THE BABY GREW WITHOUT ANY IDEA OF WHO HE WAS WHEN HE WAS A YEAR OLD HE WAS SENT TO THE POOR FARM WHERE AN OLD WOMAN TOOK CARE OF ORPHAN CHILDREN
AND THAT NOW ONE OF HIS KINDRED BY SOME UNKNOWN ERROR HAD BEEN SEIZED THEY CHEERED HIM LIFTED HIM ON THEIR SHOULDERS AND RUSHED AWAY TO DEMAND FOR HIM THE RELEASE OF DARNAY
THE WAVES THREW HIS DROWNED BODY FINALLY ON THE EDGE OF A DISMAL SWAMP IN THE RED GLARE OF THE BLAZING RUIN WHICH THE OVERTURNED STOVE THAT NIGHT MADE OF THE BUILDING IN WHICH HE HAD FRAMED HIS EVIL PLOTS AND THIS WAS THE END OF QUILP THE DWARF
MISTER GEORGE HAD AMONG HIS PAPERS A LETTER ONCE WRITTEN HIM BY CAPTAIN HAWDON AND NOT KNOWING THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS TO BE USED LOANED IT TO THE LAWYER THE HANDWRITING WAS THE SAME AND THUS MISTER TULKINGHORN KNEW THAT THE COPYIST HAD REALLY BEEN CAPTAIN HAWDON
DEFARGE READ IT ALOUD TO THE JURY AND THIS WAS THE TERRIBLE TALE IT TOLD THE MARQUIS DE SAINT EVREMONDE THE CRUEL UNCLE OF DARNAY WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN
HE BURST OUT CRYING SO THAT A KIND HEARTED MAGISTRATE INTERFERED AND WOULD NOT LET THE CHIMNEY SWEEP HAVE HIM MISTER BUMBLE FINALLY GAVE HIM TO THE VILLAGE UNDERTAKER
AND LUCIE AND STARTED FOR ENGLAND THAT VERY HOUR MISS PROSS WAS LEFT TO FOLLOW THEM IN ANOTHER CARRIAGE WHILE MISS PROSS SAT WAITING IN THE EMPTY HOUSE WHO SHOULD COME IN BUT THE TERRIBLE MADAME DEFARGE
HE SAW HERE AN EXCELLENT CHANCE TO PUT HIS SYSTEM TO THE TEST TO TAKE THIS UNTAUGHT GIRL AND BRING HER UP FROM THE START ENTIRELY ON FACTS WOULD BE A GOOD EXPERIMENT WITH THIS IN VIEW THEN HE PROPOSED TO TAKE SISSY TO HIS HOUSE
THERE WAS A FURTHER REASON FOR MADAME DEFARGE'S HATRED FOR THE POOR WOMAN WHOM DARNAY'S UNCLE HAD SO WRONGED HAD BEEN HER OWN SISTER IN VAIN OLD DOCTOR MANETTE PLEADED
FROM HIS WONDERFUL RESEMBLANCE TO THEIR DEAD FATHER HE GUESSED AT ONCE
THE BOYS HAD NOTHING BUT THIN GRUEL FOR THEIR MEALS WITH AN ONION TWICE A WEEK AND HALF A ROLL ON SUNDAYS THEY ATE IN A GREAT STONE HALL IN ONE END OF WHICH STOOD THE BIG COPPER OF GRUEL
THE EVIL AND FOLLY OF SELFISHNESS IS WHAT DICKENS HAD IN MIND WITH HIS INCREASING WEALTH DICKENS HAD OF COURSE CHANGED HIS MANNER OF LIFE HE LIVED PART OF THE TIME IN THE COUNTRY NEAR LONDON IN BRIGHTON IN DOVER AND IN FRANCE AND ITALY
A POLICEMAN WAS AT HAND AND HE WAS DRAGGED MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE TO THE POLICE COURT FOLLOWED BY THE ANGRY OLD GENTLEMAN THE MOMENT THE LATTER SAW THE BOY'S FACE
PEEVISH TORMENTING ONE OF HER NOBLE RELATIVES AN INVALID WITH A LAME LEG BUT MEANWHILE ANOTHER DAY HAD PASSED
HE WAS ABOUT OLIVER'S AGE WITH A SNUB NOSE BOW LEGS AND LITTLE SHARP EYES
THIS FRIGHTFUL HUMAN STORM WHICH FOR SO MANY YEARS HAD BEEN GATHERING IN FRANCE BURST OVER PARIS THE POOR PEOPLE ROSE BY THOUSANDS SEIZED WHATEVER WEAPONS THEY COULD GET GUNS AXES OR EVEN STONES OF THE STREET AND
RODE WITH JINGLE ROCHESTER WAS REALLY THE CLOISTERHAM WHERE THE WICKED CHOIR MASTER JOHN JASPER KILLED HIS NEPHEW IN THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD AND IT WAS IN THOSE VERY MARSHES NEAR BY THAT MAGWITCH
TILL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN SIKES WOKE HIM ROUGHLY AND BADE HIM COME WITH THEM IT WAS FOGGY AND COLD AND DARK OUTSIDE SIKES AND ONE OF THE OTHERS EACH TOOK ONE OF OLIVER'S HANDS
SHE KNEW HIS STORY AND LOVED HIM TOO HE COULD NOT MARRY HER BECAUSE HIS OWN WIFE STOOD IN THE WAY NOR COULD HE EVEN SEE OR WALK WITH HER OFTEN FOR FEAR BUSY TONGUES MIGHT TALK OF IT
SUCH HE SAID AS HE HAD NEVER SEEN AND THREW BOTH ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK THEY DID NOT KNOW AT FIRST THAT SHE WAS DEAD THEY LAID LITTLE NELL TO REST THE NEXT DAY IN THE CHURCHYARD WHERE SHE HAD SO OFTEN SAT
AND THIS MONEY WAS STILL UNPAID WHEN HE HAD DISAPPEARED IT WAS SAID THAT HE HAD FALLEN OVERBOARD FROM A VESSEL AND HAD BEEN DROWNED TO THINK NOW THAT THE CAPTAIN HAD BEEN LIVING AS A COPYIST ALL THESE YEARS IN LONDON FREE FROM ARREST FOR THE DEBT
JOE A WRETCHED CROSSING SWEEPER TO WHOM WHEN HE HAD IT HE OFTEN GAVE A COIN THUS MUCH THE LAWYER LEARNED BUT FROM THE STRANGE LODGER HIMSELF HE LEARNED NOTHING
AND READ IT NOW THROUGH TEARS OF JOY AND PRIDE HE FOLLOWED THIS WITH OTHERS AS SUCCESSFUL
FOR A THUNDER STORM WAS ROLLING UP MISSUS SPARSIT DID NOT CATCH LOUISA'S ANSWER WHERE AND WHEN HARTHOUSE ASKED HER TO JOIN HIM SHE COULD NOT HEAR BUT AS HE MOUNTED AND RODE AWAY SHE THOUGHT HE SAID TO NIGHT
AND WAS FULL OF STORIES OF SECRET THEFTS AND MURDERS FOR THE OLD JEW HAVING TORTURED HIS MIND BY LONELINESS AND GLOOM HAD LEFT THE VOLUME IN HIS WAY HOPING IT WOULD INSTIL INTO HIS SOUL THE POISON THAT WOULD BLACKEN IT FOR EVER
HALF HIDDEN BY RUBBISH AND GRASSES YAWNED THE RAGGED MOUTH OF A DARK ABANDONED SHAFT THAT INSTANT BOTH RACHEL AND SISSY GUESSED THE TRUTH THAT STEPHEN RETURNING HAD NOT SEEN THE CHASM IN THE DARKNESS AND HAD FALLEN INTO ITS DEPTHS
SOMETIMES WALKING A GOOD PART OF THE WAY CLEANLY AND PLAINLY DRESSED AND WITH HER SPARE SHAWL AND UMBRELLA JUST TO WATCH HIM GO INTO HIS FINE HOUSE OR TO LOOK IN ADMIRATION AT THE MILLS OR THE FINE BANK HE OWNED
AS CARTON WALKED ALONG THE STREET THINKING SADLY OF LUCIE'S NEW GRIEF HE SAW A MAN WHOSE FACE AND FIGURE SEEMED FAMILIAR FOLLOWING HE SOON RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE ENGLISH SPY BARSAD
AND YET WHOSE MANNERS AND APPEARANCE WERE PICTURED SO REALLY THAT THEY SEEMED TO BE ACTUAL PERSONS WHOM ONE MIGHT MEET AND LAUGH WITH ANYWHERE WITH SUCH A SUCCESS AND THE MONEY IT BROUGHT HIM DICKENS HAD LEISURE TO BEGIN THE WONDERFUL SERIES OF STORIES
AND TO CARE FOR AND TEACH HER PROVIDED
CERTAINLY ITS HONEST FUN ITS MERRIMENT ITS QUAINTNESS GOOD HUMOR AND CHARITY APPEALED TO EVERY READER MORE THAN ALL IT MADE PEOPLE ACQUAINTED WITH A NEW COMPANY OF CHARACTERS NONE OF WHOM HAD EVER EXISTED OR COULD EVER EXIST
HE WAS NOW BOTH FAMOUS AND RICH HE BOUGHT A HOUSE ON GAD'S HILL A PLACE NEAR CHATHAM WHERE HE HAD SPENT THE HAPPIEST PART OF HIS CHILDHOOD AND SETTLED DOWN TO A LIFE OF COMFORT AND LABOR
THIS WAS BY NO MEANS AN EASY TASK BUT DICKENS HAD GREAT STRENGTH OF WILL AND A DETERMINATION TO DO WELL WHATEVER HE DID AT ALL AND HE SUCCEEDED JUST AS DAVID COPPERFIELD DID IN THE STORY
THE DWARF RECEIVED WARNING FROM SALLY BRASS BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO GET AWAY WHEN HE HEARD THE KNOCKING ON THE GATES AND KNEW THAT THE LAW HE HAD SO LONG DEFIED WAS AT LAST UPON HIM HE FELL INTO A PANIC AND DID NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN
SO HE TRIED TO FIND SOME ONE THEY HAD LOVED TO GO WITH HIM TO SHOW THAT HE INTENDED ONLY KINDNESS HE WAS NOT LONG IN HEARING OF KIT WHO HAD FOUND A SITUATION AS FOOTMAN AND HE GAINED HIS EMPLOYER'S LEAVE TO TAKE THE LAD WITH HIM
HAD BEEN ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT AND NOW SPENT MUCH TIME IN LONDON
THESE HAPPY YEARS WERE NOT TO LAST LONG WHEN HE WAS NINE YEARS OLD HIS FATHER BECAME POOR AND THE FAMILY WAS OBLIGED TO MOVE TO LONDON WHERE IT LIVED IN A SHABBY HOUSE IN A POOR SUBURB
WHOM HE HAD THUS SAVED TO HER HE WENT ALMOST GLADLY A POOR LITTLE SEAMSTRESS RODE IN THE DEATH CART BESIDE HIM SHE WAS SO SMALL AND WEAK THAT SHE FEARED TO DIE AND CARTON HELD HER COLD HAND
THAN TO HIDE HIS CRIME BY THROWING SUSPICION ON SOME ONE ELSE HE COULD FORCE THE DOOR OF THE SAFE BEFORE HE LEFT AT NIGHT AND DROP A KEY OF THE BANK DOOR WHICH HE HAD SECRETLY MADE
AND THE HOUSES OLD AND HIDEOUSLY FILTHY THE PEOPLE TOO SEEMED LOW AND WRETCHED HE WAS JUST WONDERING IF HE HAD NOT BETTER RUN AWAY WHEN THE BOY PUSHED OPEN A DOOR
ONCE OR TWICE RIDING IN CARTS WHICH WERE GOING IN THEIR DIRECTION WHENEVER THIS HAPPENED SIKES KEPT HIS HAND IN THE POCKET WHERE THE PISTOL WAS SO THAT OLIVER WAS AFRAID TO APPEAL FOR HELP
WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS AMUSING SO THAT HE FOUND LIFE NO BETTER THAN IT HAD BEEN AT THE WORKHOUSE THE UNDERTAKER HAD AN APPRENTICE TOO WHO KICKED HIM WHENEVER HE CAME NEAR
SO THAT HE TOO WOULD BE A BURGLAR HIS LIMBS BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND HE SANK TO HIS KNEES BEGGING THEM TO HAVE MERCY AND TO LET HIM RUN AWAY AND DIE IN THE FIELDS RATHER THAN TO MAKE HIM STEAL
ALL THIS WRETCHEDNESS OLIVER BORE AS WELL AS HE COULD WITHOUT COMPLAINING BUT ONE DAY THE COWARDLY APPRENTICE BEGAN TO SAY UNKIND THINGS OF OLIVER'S DEAD MOTHER AND THIS HE COULD NOT STAND
THIS SO ENRAGED THE LAWYER THAT WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE LITTLE MAID'S EVIDENCE AND FOUND THAT HE HIMSELF WAS CAUGHT HE MADE FULL CONFESSION OF THE PART QUILP HAD PLAYED AND TOLD THE WHOLE STORY TO REVENGE HIMSELF ON THE DWARF
AND SCARCELY THREE YEARS AFTER HIS LEAVING THE DAILY NEWS HE BEGAN THE PUBLICATION OF A NEW MAGAZINE WHICH HE CALLED HOUSEHOLD WORDS HIS AIM WAS TO MAKE IT CHEERFUL USEFUL AND AT THE SAME TIME CHEAP SO THAT THE POOR COULD AFFORD TO BUY IT AS WELL AS THE RICH
AS A MATTER OF FACT HIS GRANDMOTHER HAD BEEN A RESPECTABLE HONEST SOUL AND HIS MOTHER HAD PINCHED AND SAVED TO BRING HIM UP DECENTLY HAD GIVEN HIM SOME SCHOOLING AND FINALLY APPRENTICED HIM IN A GOOD TRADE
THE ROBBERY OF BOUNDERBY'S BANK IN ONE OF BOUNDERBY'S WEAVING MILLS A MAN NAMED STEPHEN BLACKPOOL HAD WORKED FOR YEARS HE WAS STURDY AND HONEST BUT HAD A STOOPING FRAME A KNITTED BROW AND IRON GRAY HAIR
AND LEFT SECRETLY SENDING A LETTER BACK TELLING HER WHERE AND WHY HE WAS GOING AND BY THE TIME SHE READ THIS HE WAS WELL ON HIS WAY FROM ENGLAND DARNAY HAD EXPECTED TO FIND NO TROUBLE IN HIS ERRAND AND LITTLE PERSONAL RISK IN HIS JOURNEY
SHE THOUGHT IT A CAPITAL CHANCE TO MAKE SOME MONEY SHE WENT THEREFORE TO MONKS'S HOUSE AND SOLD THE LOCKET AND RING TO HIM THESE MONKS THOUGHT
BOUNDERBY FLEW INTO A STILL GREATER RAGE AND STAMPED OFF SWEARING HIS WIFE SHOULD COME HOME BY NOON NEXT DAY OR NOT AT ALL TO BE SURE LOUISA DID NOT GO AND NEXT DAY BOUNDERBY SENT HER CLOTHES TO MISTER GRADGRIND
BUT SIKES DREW HIS PISTOL WITH A FRIGHTFUL OATH AND DRAGGED HIM ON IN THE BACK OF THE HOUSE WAS A WINDOW WHICH WAS NOT FASTENED BECAUSE IT WAS MUCH TOO SMALL FOR A MAN TO GET THROUGH BUT OLIVER WAS SO LITTLE THAT HE COULD DO IT EASILY
THE SAFE TOM DECLARED HE HAD FOUND OPEN WITH A LARGE PART OF ITS CONTENTS MISSING A KEY TO THE BANK DOOR WAS PICKED UP IN THE STREET THIS IT WAS CONCLUDED THE THIEF HAD THROWN AWAY AFTER USING WHO HAD DONE IT HAD ANY SUSPICIOUS PERSON BEEN SEEN ABOUT THE PLACE
AND IN HER SHAME STOLE AWAY FROM HER HOME POOR AND ILL CLAD TO DIE FINALLY IN THE POORHOUSE THE OLDER BROTHER WHO HAD TAKEN THE NAME OF MONKS HUNTED AND HUNTED FOR THEM
AS FROM THE MOST FAMOUS IT WAS WHILE ENGAGED IN THIS WORK THAT DICKENS WROTE THE BEST ONE OF ALL HIS TALES DAVID COPPERFIELD THE ONE WHICH IS IN SO LARGE A PART THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN EARLY LIFE THIS BOOK BROUGHT DICKENS TO THE HEIGHT OF HIS CAREER
HE LIVED THERE TILL HE WAS A PALE HANDSOME BOY OF NINE YEARS AND THEN HE WAS TAKEN TO THE WORKHOUSE WHERE WITH MANY OTHER BOYS OF HIS OWN AGE OR OLDER HE HAD TO WORK HARD ALL DAY PICKING OAKUM
AND DOWN BENEATH THE FACTS OF HIS SYSTEM HE HAD IT STILL THOUGH IT HAD BEEN COVERED UP SO LONG THAT NOBODY WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT LEAST OF ALL PERHAPS HIS OWN CHILDREN MISTER GRADGRIND'S INTIMATE FRIEND ONE WHOM HE WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO ADMIRE
BUT AS SOON AS HE LANDED ON THE SHORES OF FRANCE HE DISCOVERED HIS MISTAKE HE HAD ONLY TO GIVE HIS REAL NAME THE MARQUIS DE SAINT EVREMONDE WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO IF HE WOULD HELP GABELLE
DICKENS'S LIFE AT THIS TIME WAS SO MISERABLE THAT ALWAYS AFTERWARD HE DREADED TO SPEAK OF IT AND NEVER COULD BEAR EVEN TO WALK IN THE STREET WHERE THE BLACKING WAREHOUSE OF HIS BOYHOOD HAD STOOD
TO GET WORK UNDER HIS OWN NAME HE HAD TAKEN ANOTHER NOW THAT HE WAS DIRECTLY CHARGED WITH THE CRIME SHE WROTE HIM THE NEWS AT ONCE SO THAT HE MIGHT LOSE NO TIME IN RETURNING TO FACE THE UNJUST ACCUSATION
LATER AT SIR LEICESTER'S
WALKING PAST THE BUILDING AGAIN AND AGAIN WATCHING VAINLY FOR TOM TO APPEAR
MISSUS SPARSIT STOOD BEHIND A TREE LIKE ROBINSON CRUSOE
HOWEVER THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE OLD BARONET LOVED HIS WIFE AND WAS VERY PROUD OF HER SIR LEICESTER'S FAMILY LAWYER WAS NAMED TULKINGHORN HE WAS A DULL DIGNIFIED MAN WHO ALWAYS DRESSED IN BLACK AND SELDOM SPOKE UNLESS HE HAD TO
FOR IN HIS FORTY YEARS HE HAD KNOWN MUCH TROUBLE MANY YEARS BEFORE HE HAD MARRIED UNHAPPILY FOR THROUGH NO FAULT OR FAILING OF HIS OWN HIS WIFE TOOK TO DRINK LEFT OFF WORK AND BECAME A SHAME AND A DISGRACE TO THE TOWN
AND BELIEVING THAT AT LEAST IT WOULD HELP TOM SHE CONSENTED SHE MARRIED BOUNDERBY THE RICHEST MAN IN COKETOWN AND WENT TO LIVE IN HIS FINE HOUSE WHILE MISSUS SPARSIT THE HOUSEKEEPER
AND AT LENGTH HIS TURN CAME TO BE TRIED AND HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE DRUNKEN IGNORANT MEN WHO CALLED THEMSELVES JUDGE AND JURY
AND INVITING HER TO TAKE HERSELF OFF AT ONCE SO MISSUS SPARSIT FOR ALL HER CAP SETTING AND SPYING
THE TRUTH WAS THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER WAS A LONG MISSING BROTHER OF LITTLE NELL'S GRANDFATHER A MISUNDERSTANDING HAD COME BETWEEN THEM MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN BOTH WERE YOUNG MEN THE YOUNGER HAD BECOME A TRAVELER IN MANY COUNTRIES AND HAD NEVER SEEN HIS BROTHER SINCE
HE TOLD HIM TO WAIT DURING THE NEXT TWO OR THREE EVENINGS NEAR THE DOOR OF BOUNDERBY'S BANK AND PROMISED THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD SEEK STEPHEN THERE AND TELL HIM FURTHER THERE WAS NO KINDNESS HOWEVER IN THIS PROPOSAL
AND DO WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM THE FIRST ONE WHO CAME BY WAS A MIDDLE AGED CHIMNEY SWEEP WHO WANTED A BOY TO CLIMB UP THE INSIDES OF CHIMNEYS AND CLEAN OUT THE SOOT THIS WAS A DANGEROUS THING TO DO FOR SOMETIMES THE BOYS WHO DID IT
WHO WAS TO DIE WITHIN THE HOUR SO SHE STOPPED ON HER WAY TO THE EXECUTION TO SEE LUCIE AND THUS HAVE EVIDENCE AGAINST HER
LOUISA CAME TO HIM SHE HAD WITNESSED THE INTERVIEW IN WHICH HER HUSBAND HAD DISCHARGED THIS FAITHFUL WORKMAN HAD FOUND OUT WHERE HE LIVED AND HAD MADE HER BROTHER TOM BRING HER THERE THAT SHE MIGHT TELL STEPHEN HOW SORRY SHE WAS
AND KEPT POOR RICHARD CARSTONE FROM HIS FORTUNE TILL THE FORTUNE ITSELF HAD DISAPPEARED WAS A VERY WRONG LEGAL SYSTEM INDEED OFTEN TOO DICKENS'S STORIES ARE IN A SENSE SERMONS AGAINST VERY HUMAN SINS
AND HE HEARD IT WITH ASTONISHMENT AND WONDER TO FIND SUCH A GREAT HEART AND HEROISM IN A CHILD HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED SCHOOLMASTER HE TOLD HER IN ANOTHER TOWN TO WHICH HE WAS THEN ON HIS WAY AND HE DECLARED THEY SHOULD GO WITH HIM AND HE WOULD CARE FOR THEM
OF THE BASTILLE WHERE HE HAD LIVED THOSE EIGHTEEN YEARS NOT KNOWING WHETHER HIS WIFE AND CHILD LIVED OR DIED HE WAITED TEN YEARS FOR RELEASE AND WHEN NONE CAME AT LAST FEELING HIS MIND GIVING WAY HE WROTE THE ACCOUNT
HE KEPT IN HIS ROOM A BIG BOX LIKE TRUNK IN WHICH WAS A SILVER STOVE THAT HE USED TO COOK HIS MEALS THE STOVE HAD A LOT OF LITTLE OPENINGS IN ONE HE WOULD PUT AN EGG IN ANOTHER SOME COFFEE IN ANOTHER A PIECE OF MEAT AND IN THE FOURTH
NUMBERS OF WHICH AT THAT TIME WERE MANAGED BY MEN ALMOST AS CRUEL AND INHUMAN AS WAS SQUEERS IN THE STORY IT IS GOOD TO LEARN THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS NOVEL AN END WAS MADE OF MANY SUCH BOYS SCHOOLS
NO ONE GAVE THEM ANYTHING AND THEY LIVED FOR THREE DAYS WITH ONLY TWO PENNY LOAVES TO EAT FOR ALL THEIR MONEY WAS NOW GONE AND SLEPT AT NIGHT IN THE ASHES OF SOME POOR LABORER'S HUT THE FOURTH DAY THEY DRAGGED THEMSELVES INTO THE COUNTRY AGAIN
AND THEN INVITE THEM TO HIS ROOMS WHERE HE WOULD QUESTION THEM FOR A LONG TIME
HE HAD COME TO THIS MELANCHOLY CONCLUSION THIS VERY DAY AND HAD SENT SISSY OUT ON AN ERRAND SO THAT HE MIGHT SLIP AWAY ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DOG MERRYLEGS WHILE SHE WAS ABSENT
THE SCHOOLMASTER CARRIED HER TO AN INN NEAR BY WHERE SHE WAS PUT TO BED AND DOCTORED UNDER HIS CARE FOR SHE WAS VERY WEAK SHE TOLD HIM ALL THE STORY OF THEIR WANDERINGS
UNDER HIS MOUNTAIN OF FACTS STIRRED AGAIN AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE MOUNTAIN CRUMBLED AWAY AND HE SAW IN AN INSTANT AS BY A LIGHTNING FLASH THAT THE PLAN OF LIFE TO WHICH HE HAD SO RIGIDLY HELD WAS A COMPLETE AND HIDEOUS FAILURE
OR RIDING HORSEBACK WITH HIS DOGS RACING AFTER HIM HE LIKED BEST TO WANDER ALONG THE CLIFFS OR ACROSS THE DOWNS BY THE SEA WHEN HE WAS IN LONDON HE OFTEN WALKED THE STREETS HALF THE NIGHT THINKING OUT HIS STORIES
HIS FATHER WAS PUT INTO PRISON FOR DEBT THE SAME PRISON IN WHICH LITTLE DORRIT IN THE STORY OF THAT NAME GREW UP A VERY BITTER PERIOD FOLLOWED FOR THE SOLITARY TEN YEAR OLD BOY A TIME IN WHICH HE LONG AFTERWARD WROTE
NEXT DAY AT THE NOON HOUR HE WENT TO HIS EMPLOYER'S HOUSE TO ASK HIS ADVICE HE KNEW THE LAW SOMETIMES RELEASED TWO PEOPLE FROM THE MARRIAGE TIE WHEN ONE OR THE OTHER LIVED WICKEDLY
AND NOT SEEING RACHEL IN THESE DAYS WAS LONELY AND DISHEARTENED THIS CONDITION OF THINGS DID NOT ESCAPE THE EYE OF BOUNDERBY WHO SENT FOR STEPHEN AND QUESTIONED HIM BUT EVEN IN HIS TROUBLE
NANCY TOOK HIM TO THE HOUSE WHERE SIKES LIVED AND THE NEXT MORNING THE LATTER STARTED OUT MAKING OLIVER GO WITH HIM
THAT SAME NIGHT OF HIS RELEASE ALL THE HAPPINESS OF DARNAY AND LUCIE WAS SUDDENLY BROKEN SOLDIERS CAME AND AGAIN ARRESTED HIM DEFARGE AND HIS WIFE WERE THE ACCUSERS THIS TIME AND HE WAS TO BE RETRIED
SLEARY FOR SISSY'S SAKE HAD PROVIDED TOM WITH A DISGUISE IN WHICH NOT EVEN HIS FATHER RECOGNIZED HIM
THE ONE BEFORE OLIVER WAS NAMED SWUBBLE THEN CAME OLIVER WITH A T THE NEXT WOULD BE UNWIN THE NEXT VILKINS
SIKES HAD A LOADED PISTOL IN HIS OVERCOAT POCKET AND HE SHOWED THIS TO OLIVER AND TOLD HIM IF HE SPOKE TO ANYBODY ON THE ROAD OR TRIED TO GET AWAY HE WOULD SHOOT HIM WITH IT THEY WALKED A LONG WAY OUT OF LONDON
AND HAD LITTLE TO EAT AND MANY WHIPPINGS MISTER BUMBLE THE MASTER OF THE POORHOUSE WAS A POMPOUS SELF IMPORTANT BULLY WHO BROWBEAT EVERY ONE WEAKER THAN HIMSELF
AND HE BECAME MORE ANXIOUS THAN EVER TO FIND OUT WHAT CONNECTION THERE COULD BE BETWEEN THIS PROUD AND TITLED WOMAN AND THE MISERABLE COPYIST WHO HAD LIVED AND DIED IN SQUALOR CHANCE FAVORED MISTER TULKINGHORN'S OBJECT
HIS JOINTS WERE GETTING STIFF HE MISSED IN HIS TUMBLING AND HE COULD NO LONGER MAKE THE PEOPLE LAUGH AS HE HAD ONCE DONE
THEY RAN AND ROUSED THE TOWN CROWDS CAME FROM COKETOWN ROPE AND WINDLASS WERE BROUGHT AND TWO MEN WERE LOWERED INTO THE PIT THE POOR FELLOW WAS THERE ALIVE BUT TERRIBLY INJURED
SO HE TRUDGED STOUTLY ON AND BEFORE NIGHTFALL HAD WALKED TWENTY MILES HE BEGGED A CRUST OF BREAD AT A COTTAGE AND SLEPT UNDER A HAYRICK THE NEXT DAY AND NIGHT HE WAS SO VERY HUNGRY AND COLD
A BURNT MARK IN THE FLOOR AND A STICKY SMOKE THAT STUCK TO THE WINDOW PANES AND HUNG IN THE AIR LIKE SOOT AND THIS WAS ALL THE NEIGHBORS FOUND WHEN THEY CAME TO SEARCH FOR HIM THIS WAS THE END OF KROOK
ALL THESE THINGS MADE FAGIN DETERMINED TO GAIN POSSESSION OF OLIVER AGAIN AND TO DO THIS HE GOT THE HELP OF TWO OTHERS A YOUNG WOMAN NAMED NANCY AND HER LOVER A BRUTAL ROBBER NAMED BILL SIKES
THEN HE WAS TAKEN TO AN EMPTY CELL AND LEFT ALONE IT HAPPENED THAT THE BANK OF WHICH MISTER LORRY WAS AGENT HAD AN OFFICE ALSO IN PARIS AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD COME THERE ON BUSINESS THE DAY BEFORE DARNAY ARRIVED
FOR THEIR CAGES TO BE OPENED TO DESTROY ALL IN THEIR PATH THEY WERE AFRAID OF COURSE TO KEEP ANY WRITTEN LIST OF PERSONS WHOM THEY HAD THUS CONDEMNED SO MADAME DEFARGE THE WIFE OF THE WINE SELLER
HIS ONE PASSION WAS THE DISCOVERY OF OTHER PEOPLE'S SECRETS HE KNEW MORE FAMILY SECRETS THAN ANY ONE ELSE IN LONDON AND TO DISCOVER A NEW ONE HE WOULD HAVE RISKED ALL HIS FORTUNE NOW
IT IS SAD TO REFLECT THAT HE WHO HAS PAINTED SO BEAUTIFULLY FOR OTHERS THE JOYS AND SORROWS OF PERFECT LOVE AND HOME WAS HIMSELF DESTINED TO KNOW NEITHER THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED THIS SEPARATION WERE YEARS OF CONSTANT LABOR FOR DICKENS
AT MISTER CRUMMLES'S THEATER BUT HIS ACTING WAS FOR HIS OWN AMUSEMENT AND IT IS DOUBTFUL IF HE EVER THOUGHT SERIOUSLY OF ADOPTING THE STAGE AS A PROFESSION IF HE DID HIS SUCCESS AS A REPORTER SOON DETERMINED HIM OTHERWISE
IN THE FIRST TWO OF THESE STORIES ONE MAY SEE MOST CLEARLY THE PRINCIPLE THAT UNDERLAY ALMOST ALL OF DICKENS'S WORK HE WAS NEVER CONTENT MERELY TO TELL AN INTERESTING STORY HE WROTE WITH A PURPOSE
THE OLD MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD FOR GRIEF HAD KILLED ALL MEMORY PUSHING THEM ASIDE HE WENT INTO THE NEXT ROOM CALLING LITTLE NELL'S NAME SOFTLY AS HE WENT THEY FOLLOWED KIT SOBBED AS THEY ENTERED FOR THERE ON HER BED LITTLE NELL LAY DEAD
AS THE BROTHER LAY DYING FROM THE SWORD WOUND DOCTOR MANETTE
UNKNOWN TO HIM A LITTLE CHILD OF HIS OWN WAS LYING DEAD AT HOME WITH SUCH A TENDER HEART FOR ALL THE WORLD HE WAS MORE THAN AN AFFECTIONATE FATHER TO HIS OWN CHILDREN AND GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO THEIR HAPPINESS AND EDUCATION
SHE WAITED IN THE RAIN REJOICING TILL HER PATIENCE WAS AT LENGTH REWARDED BY SEEING LOUISA CLOAKED AND VEILED AS IF FOR A JOURNEY COME FROM THE HOUSE AND GO TOWARD THE RAILROAD STATION
FOR HER IMAGINATION WAS QUITE STARVED UNDER THEIR TEACHINGS
AFTER EACH MEAL THEY ALL SAT STARING AT THE COPPER AND SUCKING THEIR FINGERS BUT NOBODY DARED ASK FOR MORE ONE DAY THEY FELT SO TERRIBLY HUNGRY
ABOUT THIS TIME A STRANGER CAME TO COKETOWN HE WAS JAMES HARTHOUSE A SUAVE POLISHED MAN OF THE WORLD GOOD LOOKING WELL DRESSED WITH A GALLANT YET INDOLENT MANNER AND BOLD EYES
IN THE MIDST OF THESE FEARS SHE ACCIDENTALLY DISCOVERED ONE DAY THAT THE BABY NAME OF ESTHER SUMMERSON OF BLEAK HOUSE HAD BEEN NOT SUMMERSON BUT HAWDON THIS MADE LADY DEDLOCK GUESS THE WHOLE TRUTH THAT ESTHER WAS IN REALITY HER OWN DAUGHTER
DAY WHAT HE MEANT CARTON HAD IN FACT FORMED A DESPERATE PLAN TO RESCUE LUCIE'S HUSBAND WHOM HE SO MUCH RESEMBLED IN FACE AND FIGURE EVEN THOUGH IT MEANT HIS OWN DEATH
WHERE THEY COULD NEVER BE FOUND BUT MONKS DID NOT GIVE UP SEARCHING FOR OLIVER AND AT LAST ON THE VERY DAY THAT OLIVER WAS ARRESTED HE SAW HIM COMING FROM FAGIN'S HOUSE WITH THE ARTFUL DODGER
WONDERED TO SEE HIS BOWED FORM HAUNTING THE PLACE NOTHING CAME OF HIS WAITING HOWEVER AND THE FOURTH MORNING SAW HIM WITH HIS THOUGHTS ON RACHEL TRUDGING OUT OF TOWN ALONG THE HIGHROAD BRAVELY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
A GENTLE LOVABLE GIRL OF SEVENTEEN NO SORROW EVER TOUCHED HIM AS THIS DID AFTER SHE DIED HE WROTE YEARS AFTERWARD I DREAMED OF HER EVERY NIGHT FOR MANY WEEKS AND ALWAYS WITH A KIND OF QUIET HAPPINESS
WHILE THEY TALKED THROUGH THE WINDOW THEY SAW A GREAT CROWD OF PEOPLE COME RUSHING INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE BUILDING TO SHARPEN WEAPONS AT A HUGE
THAT THE VULGAR BULLY BEGAN TO THINK HIS COLD PROUD WIFE MUCH TOO REGARDLESS OF HIM AND OF HIS IMPORTANCE WHAT PLEASED THE HAWK FACED OLD BUSYBODY MOST WAS THE GAME THE SUAVE HARTHOUSE WAS PLAYING
OR SEARCHING FOR THE ODD CHARACTERS WHICH HE PUT IN THEM THIS NATURAL ACTIVITY AND RESTLESSNESS EVEN LED HIM SOMETIMES TO MAKE POLITICAL SPEECHES AND FINALLY TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW LONDON NEWSPAPER THE DAILY NEWS OF WHICH HE WAS THE FIRST EDITOR
ADVERTISED HIS COUNTRY HOUSE FOR SALE AND NEEDING SOMETHING TO TAKE HIS SPITE OUT UPON REDOUBLED HIS EFFORTS TO FIND THE ROBBER OF THE BANK
FOR NOW THE TRUE STORY OF THE BULLYING MILL OWNER'S TALES WAS OUT BOUNDERBY WHO HAD TURNED VERY RED WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT SEEM TO ENJOY THE SCENE
HE LIKED BEST HOWEVER A LITTLE ENGLISH WATERING PLACE CALLED BROADSTAIRS A TINY FISHING VILLAGE BUILT ON A CLIFF WITH THE SEA ROLLING AND DASHING BENEATH IT
THE HAN CLOTHING I OBSERVED WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE AMERICANS AND IN MANY RESPECTS MORE LIKE THE GARB TO WHICH I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED IN THE EARLIER PART OF MY LIFE IT WAS MADE OF SYNTHETIC FABRICS LIKE SILKS LOOSE AND COMFORTABLE TROUSERS OF KNEE LENGTH AND SLEEVELESS SHIRTS
HE OUTLINED TO US BETWEEN THE GRUNTS THAT ACCOMPANIED EACH LEAP HIS PLAN OF ACTION WE HAVE TO START THE BIG BUSINESS UNH SOONER OR LATER HE SAID AND IF UNH
THE RECORD OF THE INTERIOR REAR VIEWPLATE SHOWS MEMBERS OF THE CREW CLIMBING TOWARD THE REAR REP RAY GENERATOR IN AN ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH MANUAL CONTROL OF IT AND INCREASE THE LIFT THE PROJECTOSCOPE RELAYS
WILMA AND I HAD BEEN MARRIED THE DAY AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SHIPS AND SPENT THIS INTERVENING PERIOD IN A DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON CAMPING HIGH IN THE MOUNTAINS ON OUR RETURN WE HAD A CAMP OF OUR OWN
THE ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMUNITY WAS SUMMONED BACK AND NORMAL LIFE WAS RESUMED WILMA AND I HAD BEEN MARRIED THE DAY AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SHIPS AND SPENT THIS INTERVENING PERIOD IN A DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON CAMPING HIGH IN THE MOUNTAINS
SEVEN EIGHT NINE THAT SEEMS TO BE ALL
AND SAW HIM LEAVE THE CONTROL ROOM IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ORDER AN INSTANT LATER CONFUSED SOUNDS REACHED THE CONTROL ROOM ELECTROPHONE SUCH AS MIGHT BE MADE BY A MAN FALLING HEAVILY AND FOOTSTEPS REAPPROACHED THE CONTROL ROOM
WHERE GAUNT AND BLASH ASSURED US THE MILITARY OFFICES WERE LOCATED TWICE BARKER CAUTIONED US TO STOP AS WE WERE ABOUT TO PASS IN FRONT OF MIRROR LIKE WINDOWS IN THE PASSAGE WALL AND FLATTENING OURSELVES TO THE FLOOR WE CRAWLED PAST THEM
BUT WILMA AND I HAD RAISED THE FLAPS OF OUR HELMETS AND SWITCHED OFF OUR SPEAKERS FOR CONVERSATION BETWEEN OURSELVES AND BY THE TIME WE DISCOVERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE SHIPS WERE CLEARLY VISIBLE SO FAST WERE THEY APPROACHING JUMP WE HEARD THE BOSS ORDER DEERING TO THE NORTH ROGERS TO THE EAST
LACKED STRONG HANDS IN AUTHORITY AND WERE RIFE WITH INTRIGUE ON THE WHOLE I THOUGHT I WOULD BE WISE TO STAY WITH A GROUP WHICH HAD ALREADY PROVED ITS FRIENDLINESS AND IN WHICH I SEEMED TO HAVE PROSPECTS OF ADVANCEMENT
I SPENT IN A STATE OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION FREE FROM THE RAVAGES OF KATABOLIC PROCESSES
I ASKED CREEPING TO A POSITION OPPOSITE THE DOOR AND DRAWING MY HAND GUN AGAIN THERE WAS A CHORUS OF ASSENT THEN ON THE COUNT OF THREE SHOOT UP THOSE REPELLOR RAYS ALL OF THEM
THE GK FORTY THREE
I WONDERED IF A RAID MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE BILL HEARN AND I TALKED IT OVER WITH OUR HAN AFFAIRS BOSS AND HIS EXPERTS
TWICE WE HAD TO NOSE DOWN AND LIE MOTIONLESS ON THE GROUND NEAR A ROUTE WHILE HAN SHIPS PASSED THOSE WERE TENSE MOMENTS HAD THE GREEN BACK OF OUR SHIP BEEN OBSERVED WE WOULD HAVE BEEN DISINTEGRATED IN A SECOND
WITH MY ELECTRIC TORCH I EXPLORED THE SHAFT TO ITS END BUT COULD FIND NO OTHER WAY OUT THE AIR BECAME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO BREATHE
WHEREAS THEY WOULD HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY IN HITTING IT IF IT HAD BEEN MOVING AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THEIR POSITION THEY GOT ONE REP RAY THE OTHER WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD IT UP IT FLOATED TO EARTH NOSE DOWN AND SINCE IT WAS UNARMED AND UNARMORED
AND THE HUNTING OF STRAY HAN SHIPS BECAME AN ENTHUSIASTIC SPORT THE RESULTS WERE DISASTROUS TO OUR HEREDITARY ENEMIES FROM THE PACIFIC COAST CAME THE REPORT OF A GREAT TRANSPACIFIC LINER OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TONS LIFT
WHICH MIGHT GIVE SHELTER TO THE AMERICANS BUT THEY'VE BEEN BEAMING THOSE PATHS SO HARD IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THEY EVEN HAD INFORMATION OF THIS STRATEGY AND IN ADDITION THEY'VE BEEN USING CODE FINALLY WE'VE PICKED UP THREE OF THEIR MESSAGES
AND AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED WE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF BANTER OVER WHICH ONE OF US WAS CAMP BOSS THE TITLE STOOD AFTER MY NAME ON THE BIG BOSS RECORDS AND THOSE OF THE BIG CAMBOSS OF COURSE BUT WILMA AIRILY HELD THAT THIS MEANT NOTHING AT ALL
BY ATTEMPTING TO AVOID ALLIANCES AS ANY MAN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WOULD HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY WHO ALIGNED HIMSELF WITH NO POLITICAL PARTY
WHERE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WORLD OVERGROWN WITH A VAST FOREST AND NO VISIBLE SIGN OF HUMAN HABITATION MET MY EYES I SHALL PASS OVER THE DAYS OF MENTAL AGONY THAT FOLLOWED IN MY ATTEMPT TO GRASP THE MEANING OF IT ALL
PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THAT UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE FROM WHICH I HAVE SEEN THE TWENTY FIFTH CENTURY ENTERING IT AS I DID IN ONE LEAP ACROSS A GAP OF FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO YEARS THIS STATEMENT REQUIRES ELUCIDATION
ON WHICH A FAINT LIGHT GLOWED AS A SIGNAL FOR OURSELVES MIGHT BE OBSERVED BY ANY HAN GUARD OR NIGHT PROWLER APPARENTLY IT WAS NOT
THE HANS DISCONTINUED THEIR SERVICE ALONG THIS ROUTE AND AS EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE BADLY SHAKEN BY OUR SUCCESS SENT NO RAIDERS DOWN THE BEACHES
THE HANS DISCONTINUED THEIR SERVICE ALONG THIS ROUTE AND AS EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE BADLY SHAKEN BY OUR SUCCESS SENT NO RAIDERS DOWN THE BEACHES IT WAS A FEW WEEKS LATER THAT BIG BOSS HART SENT FOR ME TONY HE SAID
TO MAKE AN INVESTIGATION OF THIS TECHNIQUE AND DEVELOP A DEFENSE AGAINST IT IN THE MEANTIME IT URGES THAT PRIVATE NAVIGATORS AVOID THIS TERRITORY IN PARTICULAR
WHICH RECENTLY WENT DEAD WHILE BEAMING THE VALLEY IN A SYSTEMATIC EFFORT TO WIPE OUT THE WORKS AND CAMPS OF THE TRIBESMEN THE OFFICE CONSIDERS AS OBVIOUS
AS SOCIETY WAS ORGANIZED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
AS I HAD FOR WILMA WE SLEPT IN GREATER COMFORT THAT NIGHT UNDER OUR INERTRON BLANKETS AND WERE OFF WITH THE DAWN LEAPING CAUTIOUSLY TO THE TOP OF THE RIDGE OVERLOOKING THE VALLEY WHICH WILMA AND I HAD LEFT THE BOSS SCANNED THE SKY WITH HIS ULTROSCOPE
SERVING AS A TARGET HIMSELF WHILE HE CALLED ON THE MEN INDIVIDUALLY TO AIM THEIR PIECES AND LOCK THEM IN POSITION
AMAZING AND IMPOSSIBLE AS IT SEEMS THERE IS A GROUP OR PERHAPS AN ENTIRE GANG SOMEWHERE AMONG US THAT IS BETRAYING US TO THE HANS IT MAY BE THE BAD BLOODS OR IT MAY BE ONE OF THOSE GANGS WHO LIVE NEAR ONE OF THE HAN CITIES YOU KNOW
AND IT ISN'T INFORMATION THE HANS ARE GIVING IN RETURN BUT SOME FORM OF GOODS OR PRIVILEGE
ON OUR RETURN WE HAD A CAMP OF OUR OWN OF COURSE
AND THAT THE SHIP HUNG STERN DOWN FOR A SHORT SPACE SWINGING LIKE A PENDULUM THE FORWARD VIEWPLATES AND INDICATORS DID NOT CEASE FUNCTIONING BUT THEIR RECORDS ARE CHAOTIC EXCEPT FOR ONE PROJECTOSCOPE STILL WHICH SHOWS THE BOWL OF THE VALLEY
I THOUGHT OTHERWISE HER SKULL MIGHT HAVE BEEN FRACTURED OH MY HEAD SHE GROANED COMING TO AS I LIFTED HER GENTLY IN MY ARMS AND STRODE OUT IN THE OPEN WITH HER
ALL THIS STUFF WE CLEARED FROM THE SUSQUANNAS A FEW HOURS AGO
DEERING HIT HER HEAD KNOCKED OUT ONE OR MORE MEMBERS OF THE CREW APPROACHING WE'RE NOT DISCOVERED YET I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM STAND A BIT LONGER BUT BE READY I THINK MY LAST WORDS MUST HAVE BEEN HEARD BY THE MAN WHO WAS APPROACHING
WILMA HUNT FOR THAT RECORD I SAID KNOWING THAT BY THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF TALKING I COULD KEEP THE ENTIRE COMMAND CONTINUOUSLY INFORMED AS TO THE SITUATION ON THE HILLSIDES KEEP YOUR GUNS TRAINED ON THE CIRCLES AND STAND BY ON THE HILLTOPS HOW MANY OF YOU ARE THERE
THAT WHOEVER IS CLEARING US TO THEM IS DOING IT PIECEMEAL IT SOUNDS LIKE A BIT OF OCCASIONAL BARTER RATHER THAN AN OUT AND OUT ALLIANCE THEY'RE HOLDING BACK AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE FOR FUTURE BARTERING PERHAPS YES HART SAID
INCREDIBLE TREASON AFTER RECEIVING THIS REPORT AND REASSURANCES OF SUPPORT FROM THE BIG BOSSES OF THE NEIGHBORING GANGS HART DETERMINED TO REESTABLISH THE WYOMING VALLEY COMMUNITY
WE NOTICED TOO THAT THE ROCK IN THE SIDE WALLS OF THE SHAFT WAS SOFT EVIDENTLY DUE TO THE RADIOACTIVITY AND PIECES CRUMBLED UNDER FOOT RATHER EASILY WE MADE OUR WAY CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE SHAFT WHEN SUDDENLY THE ROTTED TIMBERS ABOVE US GAVE WAY
ELSEWHERE I HAVE SET DOWN FOR WHATEVER INTEREST THEY HAVE IN THIS THE TWENTY FIFTH CENTURY MY PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY NOW IT OCCURS TO ME THAT MY MEMOIRS OF THE TWENTY FIFTH CENTURY MAY HAVE AN EQUAL INTEREST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW
WERE YOU EVER HERE BEFORE I ASKED NO HE REPLIED BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN STUDYING THEIR ELECTROPHONE COMMUNICATIONS FOR SEVEN YEARS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THESE MACHINES WHEN I RUN ACROSS
WHAT COULD I DO TO JAM THE CONTROLS OF THE SHIPS THAT WOULD NOT REGISTER ON THE RECORDING INSTRUMENTS OF THE OTHER SHIPS I GAZED AT THE MASS OF CONTROLS LEVERS AND WHEELS GALORE IN THE CENTER OF THE COMPARTMENT
THE AMMUNITION PLANT AND THE ROCKET SHIP PLANT WHICH HAD JUST BEEN ABOUT TO START OPERATION AT THE TIME OF THE RAID WERE INTACT AS WERE THE OTHER IMPORTANT PLANTS
AND UNTIL MY RECENT FLASH OF INSPIRATION NO ONE AMONG THEM APPARENTLY HAD EVER THOUGHT OF THE SCHEME OF SHOOTING A ROCKET INTO A REPELLOR BEAM AND LETTING THE BEAM ITSELF HURL IT UPWARD INTO THE MOST VITAL PART OF THE HAN SHIP HART PATIENTLY PLACED HIS MEN
ITS POLITICAL FINANCIAL INDUSTRIAL AND SCIENTIFIC INFLUENCE BEING SUPREME AND IN THE ARTS ALSO IT WAS RAPIDLY CLIMBING INTO LEADERSHIP I AWOKE TO FIND THE AMERICA I KNEW A TOTAL WRECK TO FIND AMERICANS A HUNTED RACE IN THEIR OWN LAND
DIRECTLY UNDER THE REGULAR SHIP ROUTES OF THE HANS WHO AS A MATTER OF PRECAUTION
AS TO THOSE OF THE EARLY NINETEENTH IN LATER YEARS
BUT WILMA LOOKED AT ME MEANINGLY AND POINTED TO WHERE THE TWISTED PLATES OF THE SHIP PROJECTING FROM THE GROUND OFFERED A SHELTER TOO LATE BOSS SHE SAID THEY'D SEE US
FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS AND THE HANS WERE JUST FINDING IT OUT FOR CENTURIES THEY HAD NOT REGARDED US AS ANY SORT OF A MENACE
AND BELLIES OF CLEAR ULTRON THAT WILL BE MORT GIBBONS SAID HART WE'VE ONLY GOT THREE SWOOPERS LEFT TONY BUT I'LL RISK ONE OF THEM IF YOU AND THE OTHERS WILL VOLUNTARILY RISK YOUR EXISTENCES BUT MIND
WHICH MADE THE LOAD WEIGH BUT A FEW OUNCES AND A SHORT SWORD THIS GEAR WE STRAPPED OVER EACH OTHER'S SHOULDERS ON TOP OF OUR JUMPING BELTS IN ADDITION WE EACH RECEIVED AN ULTROPHONE
WE'RE IN FOR IT NOW THE HANS ARE SURE TO LAUNCH REPRISAL EXPEDITIONS IF WE'RE TO SAVE THE RACE WE MUST KEEP THEM AWAY FROM OUR CAMPS AND PLANTS I'M THINKING OF DEVELOPING A PERMANENT FIELD FORCE
THE HANS QUITE OBVIOUSLY HAVE LEARNED THAT WE ARE PICKING UP THEIR ELECTROPHONE WAVES FOR THEY'VE GONE BACK TO THEIR OLD BUT EXTREMELY ACCURATE SYSTEM OF DIRECTIONAL CONTROL
AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T MISS AND I COUNTED I THINK MY THREE WAS A BIT WEAK I KNOW IT TOOK ALL THE COURAGE I HAD TO UTTER IT FOR AN AGONIZING INSTANT NOTHING HAPPENED
WITH SOME STRUGGLES WE GOT INTO OUR SPECIAL AIR HELMETS AND ADJUSTED THE PRESSURE AT OUR SIGNAL GIBBONS EXHAUSTED THE AIR IN THE COMPARTMENT PUMPING IT INTO THE BODY OF THE SHIP AND AS THE LITTLE SIGNAL LIGHT FLASHED WILMA THREW OPEN THE HATCH
THEY'RE PUTTING ARMOR OF GREAT THICKNESS IN THE HULLS OF THEIR SHIPS BELOW THE REP RAY MACHINES
THE PARTY DEBARKED LEAVING ONE MAN ON BOARD IN THE CONTROL CABIN
THE FOREST SCREEN ABOVE IT HOWEVER HAD BEEN ANNIHILATED AND IT WAS DETERMINED TO ABANDON IT AFTER REMOVING ALL USABLE MACHINERY AND EVIDENCES OF THE PROCESSES THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO THE HAN SCIENTISTS SHOULD THEY RETURN TO THE VALLEY IN THE FUTURE
BUT THEY'VE BEEN BEAMING THOSE PATHS SO HARD IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THEY EVEN HAD INFORMATION OF THIS STRATEGY AND IN ADDITION THEY'VE BEEN USING CODE FINALLY
I BEGAN THE EXPLORATION OF A DESERTED WORKING IN A MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICT WHERE SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE A NUMBER OF MINING ENGINEERS HAD REPORTED TRACES OF CARNOTITE
UNOFFICIAL INTIMATIONS FROM LO TAN ARE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE HEAVEN COUNCIL HAS THE MATTER UNDER CONSIDERATION
NO SAID THE BIG BOSS THOUGHTFULLY THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT IT THEN IT'S QUITE CLEAR I VENTURED THAT WHOEVER IS CLEARING US TO THEM IS DOING IT PIECEMEAL
THE DEDUCTION THAT THE TRIBESMEN HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW AND AS YET UNDETERMINED TECHNIQUE OF ATTACK ON AIRSHIPS AND HAS RECOMMENDED TO THE HEAVEN BORN THAT IMMEDIATE AND UNLIMITED AUTHORITY BE GIVEN THE NAVIGATION INTELLIGENCE DIVISION
THAT FIRST HAN SHIP KNEW THE LOCATION OF OUR PLANTS EXACTLY YOU REMEMBER IT FLOATED DIRECTLY INTO POSITION ABOVE THE VALLEY AND BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC BEAMING THEN THE HANS QUITE OBVIOUSLY HAVE LEARNED THAT WE ARE PICKING UP THEIR ELECTROPHONE WAVES
THERE ARE STILL MANY IN THE WORLD WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH MY UNIQUE EXPERIENCE FIVE CENTURIES FROM NOW THERE MAY BE MANY MORE ESPECIALLY IF CIVILIZATION IS FATED TO ENDURE ANY WORSE CONVULSIONS THAN THOSE WHICH HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE A D AND THE PRESENT TIME
HAD SOFTENED AND DEVITALIZED THE HANS IT HAD LIKEWISE DEVELOPED BENEATH THE PROTECTING FOLIAGE OF THE FOREST THE GROWTH OF A VIGOROUS NEW AMERICAN CIVILIZATION
THEIR REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENTIFIC PROCESSES AND MECHANICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF WORK THEY HAD NO ECONOMIC NEED FOR THE FORESTS AND NO ECONOMIC DESIRE FOR THE ENSLAVED LABOR OF AN UNRULY RACE
THEY HAD FIRED ROCKETS INTO IT WITH EASE WHEREAS THEY WOULD HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY IN HITTING IT IF IT HAD BEEN MOVING AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THEIR POSITION THEY GOT ONE REP RAY THE OTHER WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD IT UP
I WAS AFRAID THAT SOME AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE APPARATUS EXISTED IN THE ROOM THROUGH WHICH I MIGHT BE HEARD ON THE OTHER SHIPS THE RISK OF TRYING TO JAM THE CONTROLS WAS TOO GREAT I ABANDONED THE IDEA AND WITHDREW SOFTLY
WAS AS QUICKLY DEPOSED EITHER BY THEM OR BY HIS SUPERIORS AS THE ANCIENT WARD LEADER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WHO LOST CONTROL OF HIS VOTES AS SOCIETY WAS ORGANIZED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
TO BE PRECISE I LIVED THE FIRST TWENTY NINE YEARS OF MY LIFE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT AND NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN THE OTHER FIFTY TWO SINCE TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN THE GAP BETWEEN THESE TWO A PERIOD OF NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED YEARS
THERE DEVELOPED A SPIRIT OF SELF SACRIFICE AND CONSIDERATION FOR THE COMMON GOOD THAT MADE THE SCHEME APPLICABLE AND EFFICIENT IN ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CO OPERATION
WAS OF GOSSAMER FINENESS THOUGH ANYWAY I BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE LIFTED THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE FIVE OF US SO STRONG AND TOUGH WAS THIS INVISIBLE METAL AS AN EXTRA PRECAUTION SINCE THE WIRE WAS OF THE PUREST METAL AND THEREFORE TOTALLY INVISIBLE EVEN IN DAYLIGHT
TOWER PILED UP ON TOWER AND ALL BUILT ON THE VAST BASE MASS OF THE CITY
ALONG THE LINES OF THE REGULAR ARMIES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY YOU TOLD ME ABOUT ITS BUSINESS WILL BE TWOFOLD TO CARRY THE WARFARE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO THE HANS AND TO SERVE AS A DECOY
A CAREFUL SURVEY OF THE TERRITORY SHOWED THAT IT WAS ONLY THE NORTHERN SECTIONS AND SLOPES THAT HAD BEEN BEAMED BY THE FIRST HAN SHIP THE SYNTHETIC FABRICS PLANT HAD BEEN PARTIALLY WIPED OUT THOUGH THE LOWER LEVELS UNDERGROUND HAD NOT BEEN REACHED BY THE DIS RAY
ALONG THE LINES OF THE REGULAR ARMIES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY YOU TOLD ME ABOUT ITS BUSINESS WILL BE TWOFOLD TO CARRY THE WARFARE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO THE HANS AND TO SERVE AS A DECOY
THE BOSS EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IT WAS HIS IDEA THAT HE WILMA AND I SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE WRECK IF HAN SHIPS SHOULD APPEAR IN THE SKY WE WOULD LEAP FOR THE HILLSIDES I SUGGESTED TO HIM TO HAVE THE MEN SET UP THEIR LONG GUNS TRAINED ON AN IMAGINARY CIRCLE SURROUNDING THE WRECK
BUT IT WASN'T ONCE OVER THE WATER HOWEVER WE CLIMBED IN A GREAT SPIRAL TEN MILES IN DIAMETER UNTIL OUR ALTIMETER REGISTERED TEN MILES HERE GIBBONS SHUT OFF HIS ROCKET MOTOR AND WE FLOATED FAR ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE ATLANTIC LINERS
PROJECTOSCOPES HE SAID PROBABLY ON AUTOMATIC RECORD ONLY AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT STILL WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANY RECORDS FOR THEM TO STUDY AFTER WE'RE GONE
I JUMPED AHEAD BARELY ESCAPING THE AVALANCHE OF COAL AND SOFT ROCK BUT MY COMPANIONS WHO WERE SEVERAL PACES BEHIND ME WERE BURIED UNDER IT AND UNDOUBTEDLY MET INSTANT DEATH I WAS TRAPPED RETURN WAS IMPOSSIBLE
THE OTHERS MUST HAVE CRASHED DOWN WHILE I WAS DEAFENED BY THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION OF MY OWN ROCKETS SOMEBODY HIT THE OTHER REPELLOR RAY OF ONE OF THE TWO REMAINING SHIPS AND IT FELL OUT OF SIGHT BEYOND A HILLTOP THE OTHER FARTHER AWAY
WHICH MAY BRING DESTRUCTION ON ALL SHIPS ENGAGING THEREIN SO UNLESS FURTHER EVIDENCE ACTUALLY IS DEVELOPED OR THE HEAVEN BORN ORDERS TO THE CONTRARY THE MILITARY WILL HOLD TO A DEFENSIVE POLICY
SWINGING IN WIDE ARCS RECORDED LITTLE OF VALUE EXCEPT AT THE ENDS OF THEIR SWINGS ONE OF THESE FROM A MACHINE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE SET IN TELESCOPIC FOCUS SHOWS SEVERAL VIEWS OF GREAT VALUE IN PICTURING THE FALLS OF THE OTHER SHIPS
AND OF THE SYSTEM BY WHICH THE INFORMATION WAS FILED THE ATTEMPT BEGAN TO LOOK FEASIBLE THOUGH HART INSTANTLY TURNED THE IDEA DOWN WHEN I FIRST PRESENTED IT TO HIM IT WAS UNTHINKABLE HE SAID SHEER SUICIDE
WE KEPT THEM ADJUSTED TO SHORT RANGE WORK FOR FEAR THAT THOSE WHO HAD BEEN CLEARING WITH THE HANS AND AGAINST WHOM WE WERE ON A RAID FOR EVIDENCE MIGHT ALSO PICK UP OUR CONVERSATION WE HAD NO FEAR THAT THE HANS WOULD HEAR US
ALTHOUGH THE COUNCIL OF BOSSES UNH HAD INTENDED WAITING A FEW YEARS UNTIL ENOUGH ROCKET SHIPS HAVE BEEN UNH BUILT BUT NO MATTER WHAT THE SACRIFICE UNH
WE ALL HAD OUR BELTS HOOKED ON SMALL RINGS THAT SLID DOWN THE WIRE I WENT DOWN WITH THE END OF THE WIRE WILMA FOLLOWED A FEW FEET ABOVE ME THEN BARKER GAUNT AND BLASH GIBBONS OF COURSE STAYED BEHIND TO HOLD THE SHIP IN POSITION
RECORDED TWO GREEN MISSILES OF ROUGHLY CYLINDRICAL SHAPE PROJECTED FROM THE WRECKAGE INTO THE LANDING COMPARTMENT OF THE SHIP AT SUCH CLOSE RANGE THESE WERE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED
OR FROM WHICH THERE WAS ANY NEED TO OBSERVE IT THE HANS HAD NEGLECTED TO LIGHT THE TOWER ROOF OR INDEED TO OCCUPY IT AT ALL THIS WAS THE REASON WE HAD SELECTED IT AS OUR LANDING PLACE AS SOON AS GIBBONS HAD OUR WORD HE EXTINGUISHED THE KNOB LIGHT
AFRAID OF ACCIDENTS HAVE A RULING AGAINST IT LEAVE THEM TO US THEN I SAID FOR I HAD A HASTILY FORMED PLAN IN MY MIND YOU ON THE HILLSIDES TAKE THE SHIPS ABOVE ABANDON THE RING TARGET
A CAREFUL SURVEY OF THE TERRITORY SHOWED THAT IT WAS ONLY THE NORTHERN SECTIONS AND SLOPES THAT HAD BEEN BEAMED BY THE FIRST HAN SHIP
THIS TOOK SOME TIME AND CALCULATION ON THE PART OF BILL BARKER
THE BIG BOSSES HAVE JUST HELD A NATIONAL ULTROPHONE COUNCIL IT WAS DECIDED THAT AMERICA MUST ORGANIZE ON A NATIONAL BASIS THE FIRST MOVE IS TO DEVELOP SECTIONAL ORGANIZATION BY ZONES I HAVE BEEN MADE SUPERBOSS OF THE MID ATLANTIC ZONE
THAT FIRST HAN SHIP KNEW THE LOCATION OF OUR PLANTS EXACTLY YOU REMEMBER IT FLOATED DIRECTLY INTO POSITION ABOVE THE VALLEY AND BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC BEAMING THEN
EXCEPT THAT THE LANDING PARTY FROM THE SHIP STROLLED INTO MY RANGE OF VISION THEN STARTLED THEY TURNED THEIR EYES UPWARD FOR AN INSTANT THEY STOOD FROZEN WITH HORROR AT WHATEVER THEY SAW ONE HURLED HIS KNIFE AT ME
WHEN I BEGAN MY LONG SLEEP MAN HAD JUST BEGUN HIS REAL CONQUEST OF THE AIR IN A SUDDEN SERIES OF TRANSOCEANIC FLIGHTS IN AIRPLANES DRIVEN BY INTERNAL COMBUSTION MOTORS HE HAD BARELY BEGUN TO SPECULATE ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF HARNESSING SUB ATOMIC FORCES
DON'T YOU KNOW DEAR HEART THAT YOU OFFERED ME THE GREATEST INSULT A HUSBAND COULD GIVE A WIFE YOU DIDN'T OF COURSE THE OTHERS IT SEEMED HAD ALL BEEN IN ON THE SECRET AND NOW THEY WOULD HAVE KIDDED ME UNMERCIFULLY
I OPENED THE TRAP AND LOOKED DOWN BUT QUICKLY SHUT IT AGAIN WHEN I FELT THE AIR RUSHING OUT OF THE SHIP INTO THE RAREFIED ATMOSPHERE IN A TORRENT GIBBONS LITERALLY YELLED A PROTEST FROM HIS INSTRUMENT BOARD I FORGOT I MUMBLED
THIS MEANT THE THIRD PROJECTOSCOPE FROM THE BOW OF THE SHIP ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE LOWER DECK WITH WHICH HE FOLLOWED THE LANDING GROUP AS IT WALKED AROUND THE WRECK
THE WYOMING MASSACRE THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE SHIP I SPOKE QUIETLY WITH MY HAND OVER MY MOUTH FOR FEAR THEY MIGHT HEAR ME ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
WE'LL OVERPOWER THE GUARD INSIDE BUT DON'T SHOOT WE MAY ESCAPE BEING SEEN BY BOTH THIS CREW AND SHIPS ABOVE THEY CAN'T SEE OVER THIS WRECK IT WAS SO EASY THAT IT SEEMED TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
SEVEN AND FORTY NINE ONE HUNDREDTHS AFTER MIDNIGHT AFTER VIOLENT DISTURBANCES THE LOCATION FINDERS WENT OUT OF OPERATION ELECTROACTIVITY REGISTERS APPLIED TO THE TERRITORY OF THE WYOMING VALLEY REMAIN DEAD
DID NOT APPLY AS WELL TO TWENTIETH CENTURY CONDITIONS AS TO THOSE OF THE EARLY NINETEENTH IN LATER YEARS I FELT THAT THERE WAS A CERTAIN SOFTENING OF MORAL FIBER AMONG THE PEOPLE
I CONFESS I WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED THAT SHE COULD SO COURAGEOUSLY RISK MY LOSS EVEN THOUGH I WAS AMAZED AT HER FORTITUDE BUT LATER I WAS TO LEARN HOW LITTLE I KNEW HER THEN WE WERE READY TO SLIDE OFF AT DAWN THE NEXT MORNING
FOR I HAD ELECTED TO SEARCH NO FARTHER FOR A PERMANENT ALLIANCE MUCH AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH THIS TWENTY FIFTH CENTURY LIFE IN OTHER SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY THE WYOMINGS HAD A HIGH MORALE
SINCE THEY'RE SETTLING WITHOUT OPENING UP DISINTEGRATORS ANY OPINIONS MY EAR DISCS REMAINED SILENT
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LET THEM GET US ON THE RUN UNH WE'LL SET A TRAP FOR THE YELLOW DEVILS IN THE UNH VALLEY
MAKING THE UNMODIFIED SUNLIGHT UNNECESSARY FOR HEALTH AND UNDESIRABLE FOR COMFORT SINCE THE HANS DID NOT HAVE THE SECRET OF INERTRON NONE OF THEM WORE ANTI GRAVITY BELTS
AND FORTUNATELY FOR OUR PLAN IN DARKNESS
THE PHONES VIEWPLATES AND ALL OTHER SIGNALING DEVICES OF FIVE OF THE SEVEN SHIPS CEASED OPERATING SUDDENLY AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME MOMENT ABOUT SEVEN FOUR NINE ACCORDING TO THE HAN SYSTEM OF RECKONING TIME
AT THE SAME MOMENT ITS RECORDS ADD LITTLE TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DISASTER
IN A LITTLE WHILE MY SENSES REELED AND I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN I AWOKE THERE WAS A COOL AND REFRESHING CIRCULATION OF AIR IN THE SHAFT I HAD NO THOUGHT THAT I HAD BEEN UNCONSCIOUS MORE THAN A FEW HOURS
THIS CONVERSATION SET ME THINKING
SOMEWHERE IN NU YOK OR BAH FLO OR POSSIBLY IN LO TAN ITSELF THE RECORD OF THIS TRAITOROUS TRANSACTION WOULD BE MORE OR LESS OPENLY FILED IF WE COULD ONLY GET AT IT
WITH THE NAVIGATION INTELLIGENCE DIVISION IT HOLDS THAT UNLESS FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE NATURE OF THE DISASTER IS DEVELOPED IN THE NEAR FUTURE THE PUBLIC INTEREST WILL BE BETTER SERVED
THE ETERNAL CYCLE SEEMS TO BE AT WORK I FEAR THAT SLOWLY THOUGH SURELY PRIVATE WEALTH IS REAPPEARING CODES OF INFLEXIBILITY ARE DEVELOPING THEY WILL BE FOLLOWED BY CORRUPTION DEGRADATION
BUT SHE DIDN'T SHE WAS MADE OF FAR STERNER STUFF THAN THE WOMEN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY NOT THAT SHE COULDN'T WEEP AS COPIOUSLY OR BE JUST AS WHIMSICAL ON OCCASION BUT SHE WOULDN'T WEEP FOR THE SAME REASONS SHE JUST GAVE ME AN UNFATHOMABLE LOOK
AND FITTED IT TOGETHER INTO A VERY DEFINITE PICTURE OF THE GREAT CENTRAL FILING OFFICE OF THE HANS IN NU YOK WHERE THE ENTIRE MASS OF OFFICIAL RECORDS WAS KEPT CONSTANTLY AVAILABLE FOR INSTANT PROJECTOSCOPING TO ANY OF THE CITY'S OFFICES
BUT YOU TWO HAD BETTER BE MOVING HE'S BECKONING YOU NOW HART WAS ABOUT TO CALL US ON OUR PHONES WHEN WE LOOKED UP AS SOON AS WE DID SO HE LEAPED AWAY WAVING US TO FOLLOW CLOSELY HE WAS A POWERFUL MAN
THEY'RE PUTTING ARMOR OF GREAT THICKNESS IN THE HULLS OF THEIR SHIPS BELOW THE REP RAY MACHINES NEAR BAH FLO
THE SLIGHTEST RESORT TO AN ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENT HE FEARED MIGHT BE DETECTED BY OUR ENEMIES LOCATORS IN FACT WE DID NOT DARE BRING OUR SWOOPER ANY LOWER THAN FIVE MILES FOR FEAR THAT ITS CAPACITY MIGHT BE REFLECTED IN THEIR INSTRUMENTS
FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS WE WATCHED AS GIBBONS BENT OVER HIS LEVERS CONSTANTLY ADJUSTING THEM WITH DEFT TOUCHES OF HIS FINGERS AFTER A BIT OF WAVERING THE BEAM REMAINED CENTERED ON THE NEEDLE NOW I SAID LET'S DROP
A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO THERE WERE CERTAIN OF THESE PEOPLE'S ANCESTORS WHO ACTUALLY DEGRADED THEMSELVES BY MATING WITH THE HANS SOMETIMES EVEN SERVING THEM AS SLAVES IN THE DAYS BEFORE THEY BROUGHT ALL THEIR SERVICE MACHINERY TO PERFECTION
AND CONTROL THE PAYING OUT OF THE LINE WE ALL HAD OUR ULTROPHONES IN PLACE INSIDE OUR AIR HELMETS AND SO COULD CONVERSE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WITH GIBBONS BUT AT WILMA'S SUGGESTION
WE'VE PICKED UP THREE OF THEIR MESSAGES IN WHICH THEY DISCUSS WITH SOME NERVOUSNESS THE EXISTENCE OF OUR MYSTERIOUS ULTROPHONE BUT THEY STILL HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE AND CONTROL OF ULTRONIC ACTIVITY I ASKED
YOU DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO LET YOU GO ALONE DO YOU TONY I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EARS LAST NIGHT WHEN YOU SPOKE OF GOING WITHOUT ME
WE'RE IN FOR IT NOW THE HANS ARE SURE TO LAUNCH REPRISAL EXPEDITIONS IF WE'RE TO SAVE THE RACE WE MUST KEEP THEM AWAY FROM OUR CAMPS AND PLANTS I'M THINKING OF DEVELOPING A PERMANENT FIELD FORCE
SHOW THE EXPLOSIONS AS TAKING PLACE IN THE MIDST OF THE LANDING PARTY AS IT RETURNED EVIDENTLY UNSUSPICIOUS TO THE SHIP THEN IN RAPID SUCCESSION
HE SAID THROWING BACK THE LID OF WHAT I HAD SUPPOSED WAS A BIG SUPPLY CASE AND WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF WILMA STEPPED OUT OF THE CASE IF YOU GO INTO ZERO A COMMON EXPRESSION OF THE DAY FOR BEING ANNIHILATED BY THE DISINTEGRATOR RAY
SOMETIMES EVEN SERVING THEM AS SLAVES IN THE DAYS BEFORE THEY BROUGHT ALL THEIR SERVICE MACHINERY TO PERFECTION THERE IS SUCH A GANG CALLED THE NAGRAS UP NEAR BAH FLO AND ANOTHER IN MID JERSEY
SPEAK IN ROTATION FROM BALD KNOB AROUND TO THE EAST NORTH WEST IN TURN THE MEN CALLED THEIR NAMES THERE WERE TWENTY OF THEM I ASSIGNED THEM BY NAME TO COVER THE VARIOUS HAN SHIPS NUMBERING THE LATTER FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
TO PROVIDE BERTHS FOR THE GREAT LINERS AND OTHER AIR CRAFT STRAIGHT BENEATH MY FEET WAS A TINY DARK PATCH IT SEEMED THE ONLY SPOT IN THE ENTIRE CITY THAT WAS NOT AFLAME WITH RADIANCE THIS WAS THE CENTRAL TOWER
WHICH WERE INDULGED IN HOWEVER WITH GREAT RESTRAINT AND ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAINTAINING CONTACTS
AND THOSE OF THE BIG CAMBOSS OF COURSE BUT WILMA AIRILY HELD THAT THIS MEANT NOTHING AT ALL AND GENERALLY SUCCEEDED IN MAKING ME ADMIT IT WHENEVER SHE CHOSE I FOUND MYSELF A FULL FLEDGED MEMBER OF THE GANG NOW
THAT ONE WAS CONTAINED ENTIRELY IN A SMALL POCKET CASE THESE WITH WHICH WE WERE NOW EQUIPPED CONSISTED OF A PAIR OF EAR DISCS EACH A SEPARATE AND SELF CONTAINED RECEIVING SET THEY SLIPPED INTO LITTLE POCKETS OVER OUR EARS IN THE FABRIC HELMETS WE WORE
JUST WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT ANYBODY HAS BEEN CLEARING INFORMATION TO THE HANS I ASKED WELL HE REPLIED FIRST OF ALL THERE WAS THAT RAID UPON US
THERE DEVELOPED A SPIRIT OF SELF SACRIFICE AND CONSIDERATION FOR THE COMMON GOOD THAT MADE THE SCHEME APPLICABLE AND EFFICIENT IN ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CO OPERATION I HAVE A LITTLE HERESY ABOUT ALL THIS HOWEVER MY ASSOCIATES REGARD THE THOUGHT
SETTING THE ULTRON WIRE REEL I CLIMBED THROUGH AND BEGAN TO SLIDE DOWN GENTLY WE ALL HAD OUR BELTS ON OF COURSE ADJUSTED TO A WEIGHT BALANCE OF BUT A FEW OUNCES AND THE FIVE MILE REEL OF ULTRON WIRE THAT WAS TO BE OUR GUIDE
FOR THE HAN CITIES WERE ENTIRELY ENCLOSED WITH SPLENDID ARRANGEMENTS FOR VENTILATION AND HEATING THESE ARRANGEMENTS OF COURSE WERE EQUALLY ADEQUATE IN THEIR AIRSHIPS THE HANS INDEED HAD QUITE A DISTASTE FOR UNSHADED DAYLIGHT SINCE THEIR LIGHTING APPARATUS DIFFUSED A CONTROLLED AMOUNT OF VIOLET RAYS
WHICH CONCERNS OUR EARLY BATTLES AGAINST THE HANS AND NOT OUR MORE MODERN PROBLEMS OF SELF CONTROL OUR VICTORY OVER THE SEVEN HAN SHIPS HAD SET THE COUNTRY ABLAZE THE SECRET HAD BEEN CAREFULLY COMMUNICATED TO THE OTHER GANGS
AND ALL OF THE REAR PROJECTOSCOPE RECORDS ENABLE THE RECONSTRUCTION IN DETAIL OF THE PENDULUM AND TORSIONAL MOVEMENTS OF THE SHIP AND ITS SAG TOWARD THE EARTH
STAND BY AND KEEP ALERT RAPIDLY AND EASILY THE LARGEST OF THE HAN SHIPS SETTLED TO THE EARTH
UNDER THESE MODERN SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THE KIND OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM TO WHICH I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WAS IMPOSSIBLE I WOULD HAVE BEEN AS MUCH OF A NONENTITY IN EVERY PHASE OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIP
AND HAD MADE NO FURTHER PRACTICAL PENETRATION INTO THE FIELD OF ETHEREAL PULSATIONS THAN THE PRIMITIVE RADIO AND TELEVISION OF THAT DAY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE WORLD
BUT NO VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF TRIBESMEN THE CONTROL ROOM VIEWPLATE IS ALSO A CHAOTIC RECORD OF THE SHIP'S CREW TUMBLING AND FALLING TO THE REAR WALL THEN THE FORWARD REP RAY GENERATOR EXPLODED AND ALL SIGNALS WENT DEAD
BUT MUSCULARLY MUCH UNDERDEVELOPED
A FIGURE ENTERING AND LEAVING THE CONTROL ROOM HURRIEDLY THE BASE CAPTAIN NOW BELIEVES AND THE STILLS OF THE PHOTORECORD SUPPORT HIS BELIEF THAT THIS WAS NOT THE CREW MEMBER WHO HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE CONTROL ROOM BEFORE THE BASE CAPTAIN COULD SPEAK TO HIM
WE MUST HAVE WON DEAREST DID WE WE MOST CERTAINLY DID I REASSURED HER ALL BUT ONE CRASHED AND THAT ONE IS DRIFTING DOWN TOWARD THE SOUTH
IT FLOATED TO EARTH NOSE DOWN AND SINCE IT WAS UNARMED AND UNARMORED THEY HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN SHOOTING IT TO PIECES AND MASSACRING ITS CREW AND PASSENGERS IT SEEMED BARBAROUS TO ME
THE BIG BOSSES HAVE JUST HELD A NATIONAL ULTROPHONE COUNCIL IT WAS DECIDED THAT AMERICA MUST ORGANIZE ON A NATIONAL BASIS THE FIRST MOVE IS TO DEVELOP SECTIONAL ORGANIZATION BY ZONES I HAVE BEEN MADE SUPERBOSS OF THE MID ATLANTIC ZONE
FOR THEY NEEDED NOT THE FORESTS IN WHICH THE AMERICANS LIVED NOR THE RESOURCES OF THE VAST TERRITORIES THESE FORESTS COVERED WITH THE PERFECTION TO WHICH THEY HAD REDUCED THE SYNTHETIC PRODUCTION OF NECESSITIES AND LUXURIES
ON THE WHOLE I THOUGHT I WOULD BE WISE TO STAY WITH A GROUP WHICH HAD ALREADY PROVED ITS FRIENDLINESS
OUR REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE ERIES ROCKETS BOUNCED OFF HARMLESSLY MOST OF THE PARTY WAS WIPED OUT AS THE DIS RAYS WENT INTO ACTION ON THEM THIS IS GOING TO MEAN REAL BUSINESS FOR ALL OF THE GANGS BEFORE LONG
I RAN FORWARD ALONG THE KEEL GANGWAY SEARCHING FOR THE CONTROL ROOM I FOUND IT WELL UP IN THE NOSE OF THE SHIP AND IT WAS DESERTED
IN FACT WE HAD THE ADDED ADVANTAGE THAT EVEN AFTER WE LANDED WE COULD CONVERSE FREELY WITHOUT DANGER OF THEIR HEARING OUR VOICES THROUGH OUR AIR HELMETS FOR A WHILE I COULD SEE NOTHING BELOW BUT UTTER DARKNESS THEN I REALIZED FROM THE FEEL OF THE AIR
I HAD KISSED WILMA GOOD BYE AT OUR CAMP AND AFTER A FINAL CONFERENCE OVER OUR PLANS WE BOARDED OUR CRAFT AND GENTLY GLIDED AWAY OVER THE TREE TOPS ON A COURSE WHICH AFTER CROSSING THREE ROUTES OF THE HAN SHIPS WOULD TAKE US OUT OVER THE ATLANTIC OFF THE JERSEY COAST
THEY HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN SHOOTING IT TO PIECES AND MASSACRING ITS CREW AND PASSENGERS IT SEEMED BARBAROUS TO ME BUT THEN I DID NOT HAVE CENTURIES OF BITTER PERSECUTION IN MY BLOOD
THERE ENSUED SEVERAL DAYS OF RESEARCH IN WHICH THE HAN RECORDS OF THE ENTIRE DECADE WERE SCANNED AND ANALYZED IN THE END THEY PICKED OUT A MASS OF DETAIL
AND READ AS FOLLOWS THIS IS PUBLIC INTELLIGENCE OFFICE NU YOK BROADCASTING WARNING TO NAVIGATORS OF PRIVATE SHIPS AND NEWS OF PUBLIC INTEREST THE SQUADRON OF SEVEN SHIPS WHICH LEFT NU YOK THIS MORNING
OR UTTERLY DESTROYED BY THE SHIP'S DISINTEGRATOR RAYS WHICH APPARENTLY HAD CONTINUED TO OPERATE IN THE MIDST OF ITS WARPED REMAINS FOR SOME MOMENTS AFTER THE CRASH IT WAS UNPLEASANT WORK SEARCHING THE MANGLED BODIES OF THE CREW BUT IT HAD TO BE DONE
IN THE END THE HUNDRED MEN WERE RINGED ABOUT THE VALLEY ON THE HILLSIDES AND TOPS EACH IN A POSITION FROM WHICH HE HAD A GOOD VIEW OF THE WRECKAGE OF THE HAN SHIP BUT NOT A MAN HAD COME IN VIEW SO FAR AS I COULD SEE IN THE WHOLE PROCESS
I ASKED MY MEN ON THE HILLSIDES NOT YET I HEARD THE BOSS REPLY SHIPS OVERHEAD STILL STANDING NO BEAMS HAVE BEEN BROKEN OUT MEN ON GROUND ABSORBED IN WRECK MOST OF THEM HAVE CRAWLED INTO IT OUT OF SIGHT GOOD I SAID QUICKLY
AND A MOMENT LATER ANOTHER VAST HULK CRASHED TO EARTH I LOOKED OUT THEN STEPPED OUT ON THE GROUND THE ONLY HAN SHIPS IN THE SKY WERE TWO OF THE SCOUTS TO THE SOUTH WHICH WERE HANGING PERPENDICULARLY AND SAGGING SLOWLY DOWN
TRAIN YOUR ROCKETS ON THEIR REPELLOR RAYS ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY UP BETWEEN SHIPS AND GROUND AIM IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ELEVATION
FOR THEY LIVED LIVES OF DEGENERATIVE PHYSICAL INERTIA HAVING MACHINERY OF EVERY DESCRIPTION FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL LABOR AND CONVENIENT CONVEYANCES FOR ANY MOVEMENT OF MORE THAN A FEW STEPS
ON ORDERS FROM THE BASE SQUADRON COMMANDER
BUT DID NOT PENETRATE AS NEAR AS WE CAN GATHER FROM THEIR REPORTS THEIR LABORATORIES HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW ALLOY OF GREAT TENSILE STRENGTH AND ELASTICITY WHICH NEVERTHELESS
HIS COMMANDS SENDING OUT JUMPERS IN PURSUIT OF THE DESCENDING SHIP RANG IN MY EARS BUT I PAID NO ATTENTION TO THEM I LEAPED BACK INTO THE COMPARTMENT OF THE HAN SHIP AND KNELT BESIDE MY WILMA HER PADDED HELMET HAD ABSORBED MUCH OF THE BLOW
THE CHEST DISCS WERE LIKEWISE SELF CONTAINED SENDING SETS STRAPPED TO THE CHEST A FEW INCHES BELOW THE NECK AND ACTUATED BY THE VIBRATIONS FROM THE VOCAL CORDS THROUGH THE BODY TISSUES THE TOTAL RANGE OF THESE SETS WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILES
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN WILMA'S HIDING PLACE AND THE DOOR IN THE SIDE OF THE HAN SHIP WAS NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET SHE WAS ALREADY CROUCHED WITH HER FEET BRACED AGAINST A METAL BEAM TAKING THE LIFT OF THAT WONDERFUL INERTRON BELT INTO HER CALCULATION
WHICH NOW ARE BEING PATROLLED BY THE ENTIRE FORCE OF THE MILITARY OFFICE WHICH IS BEAMING THE ROUTES GENEROUSLY TO A WIDTH OF TEN MILES THE MILITARY OFFICE REPORTS THAT IT IS AT PRESENT CONSIDERING NO RETALIATORY RAIDS AGAINST THE TRIBESMEN
FINALLY HOWEVER HE SUCCEEDED IN LOCATING ABOVE THE CENTRAL TOWER OF THE CITY IF MY CALCULATIONS ARE AS MUCH AS TEN FEET OFF HE REMARKED WITH CONFIDENCE I'LL EAT THE TOWER NOW THE REST IS UP TO YOU MORT
IT SOUNDS LIKE A BIT OF OCCASIONAL BARTER RATHER THAN AN OUT AND OUT ALLIANCE THEY'RE HOLDING BACK AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE FOR FUTURE BARTERING PERHAPS YES HART SAID
THE SAND SNIPERS PRACTICALLY INVISIBLE IN THEIR SAND COLORED CLOTHING AND HALF BURIED ALONG THE BEACHES LAY IN WAIT FOR DAYS RISKING THE PLAY OF DIS BEAMS ALONG THE ROUTE AND FINALLY REGISTERING FOUR HITS WITHIN A WEEK
OR IT MAY BE ONE OF THOSE GANGS WHO LIVE NEAR ONE OF THE HAN CITIES YOU KNOW A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO THERE WERE CERTAIN OF THESE PEOPLE'S ANCESTORS WHO ACTUALLY DEGRADED THEMSELVES BY MATING WITH THE HANS
FOR THE PHONE PLANT HAD BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST TO BE PUT IN OPERATION AND WHEN IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE HANS DID NOT INTEND ANY IMMEDIATE REPRISALS THE ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMUNITY WAS SUMMONED BACK AND NORMAL LIFE WAS RESUMED
HE WAS JUST AS MUCH OF AN AUTOCRAT AND JUST AS MUCH DEPENDENT UPON THE GENERAL POPULARITY OF HIS ACTIONS FOR THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN HIS AUTOCRACY THE SUB BOSS WHO COULD NOT COMMAND THE LOYALTY OF HIS FOLLOWERS
FIRST GIVING HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CAMPMASTERS
POLITICAL LINES AND IN THIS CONNECTION IT AMUSED ME TO NOTICE HOW UNIVERSAL HAD BECOME THE USE OF THE WORD BOSS THE LEADER THE PERSON IN CHARGE OR AUTHORITY OVER ANYTHING WAS A BOSS
I RAN BACK TO THE ENTRANCE COMPARTMENT WILMA STILL LAY WHERE SHE HAD SLUMPED DOWN I HEARD THE VOICES OF THE HANS APPROACHING IT WAS TIME TO ACT THE NEXT FEW SECONDS WOULD TELL WHETHER THE SHIPS IN THE AIR WOULD TRY OR BE ABLE TO MELT US INTO NOTHINGNESS
BUT SHE DID NOT ATTAIN TO THIS POSITION OF PREEMINENCE WITHOUT A LONG AND BITTER STRUGGLE EVERY ADVANCE TOWARD THE GOAL OF SOCIAL AND INTELLECTUAL EQUALITY WAS STRENUOUSLY CONTESTED BY THE MEN
BUT GREAT AS WERE THE FREEDOM AND EDUCATIONAL ADVANTAGES OF THE ROMAN WOMEN THE STARTLING FACT REMAINS THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW FRAGMENTARY VERSES OF SLIGHT MERIT AND OF QUESTIONABLE AUTHENTICITY
BUT IT IS RATHER AS A MATHEMATICIAN THAN AS AN ASTRONOMER THAT SHE WILL BE REMEMBERED BY THE DEVOTEES OF SCIENCE THE FIRST AMERICAN WOMAN TO WIN DISTINCTION IN ASTRONOMY WAS MISS MARIA MITCHELL
AFTER THE MECHANISM OF THE HEAVENS THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONNECTION OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES
AND ABOUT HER EMINENCE AS A TEACHER OF SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY SHE WAS BUT ONE OF MANY OF THE GREEK WOMEN OF HER AGE THAT WON RENOWN BY THEIR GIFTS OF INTELLECT AND BY THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THEIR TIME AND COUNTRY
CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING WITHOUT REGARD TO SEASONS IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF HIS ASSISTANT TO NOTE THE CLOCKS AND TO WRITE DOWN THE OBSERVATIONS FROM HIS DICTATIONS AS THEY WERE MADE
ONE REQUIRING KEENER CRITICAL SENSE OR MORE PROFOUND LEARNING THAN WERE PAULA AND EUSTOCHIUM OR ONE IN WHICH THEIR EFFORTS WERE CROWNED WITH MORE BRILLIANT SUCCESS THAN WERE THOSE OF THESE TWO SUPREME EXEMPLARS
TO HER AND HER STAFF WERE ASSIGNED THE REDUCTIONS AND MEASUREMENTS OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC AND PHOTOMETRIC WORK DONE IN CAMBRIDGE AND AREQUIPA PERU SHE WAS SINGULARLY SUCCESSFUL IN HER STUDIES OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATES
THE LITERARY TREASURES OF ANTIQUITY WERE PRESERVED AND MULTIPLIED HERE MONKS AND NUNS LABORED AND STUDIED ALWAYS KEEPING LIGHTED THE SACRED TORCH OF KNOWLEDGE ET QUASI CURSORES VITAI LAMPADA TRADUNT
AMONG THESE WAS THE STOIC PHILOSOPHER C MUSONIUS RUFUS
HAD FROM HIS YOUTH BEEN AN ENTHUSIASTIC STUDENT OF ASTRONOMY
IT WAS DURING THIS PERIOD THAT SHE READ BOWDITCH'S TRANSLATION OF LAPLACE'S MECANIQUE CELESTE AND GAUSS'S THEORIA MOTUS CORPORUM CAELESTIUM IN THE ORIGINAL
BUT ALSO ONE WHO AFTER HER HUSBAND'S DEATH WAS QUITE PREPARED AS PLUTARCH ASSURES US TO UNDERTAKE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE EXTENSIVE PROPERTY WHICH HE LEFT HIS FAMILY
DESCRIBES HER AS HAVING A FACE THAT WAS SWEET SERIOUS AND MODEST HER EYES WERE DARK AND SPARKLING AND SHE WAS BLESSED WITH A POWERFUL MEMORY A SOLID JUDGMENT AND A READY IMAGINATION
BEFORE WHOM PALE THE AUSTERE VIRTUE OF THE FATHER AND THE COURAGE OF THE HUSBAND ARE THEY NOT THE PRIDE OF THE WHOLE OF ROME I SHALL ADD BUT ONE WORD MORE
PITS BARDS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND COMPARES THEM AND WEIGHS HOMER AND MARS IN THE BALANCE
HAD NO MORE LOVE FOR EDUCATED WOMEN THAN HAVE SOME OF OUR CONTEMPORARIES FOR A BLUE STOCKING HOUSEKEEPER HE GIVES HIS OPINION OF THEM IN THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTIC FASHION THAT WOMAN IS A WORSE NUISANCE THAN USUAL
AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE ANGLO SAXON NUNS JUST MENTIONED IT IS EVIDENT THAT THEY WERE OF A TRUTH WOMEN OF EXCEPTIONAL WORTH AND OF STERLING CHARACTER AND IT IS EQUALLY CLEAR
WHOSE MINDS HAD HITHERTO BEEN CONFINED TO THE COMPARATIVELY BARREN FIELD OF ROMAN LETTERS THE SPLENDID CREATIONS OF GREEK GENIUS CAME AS A REVELATION TO BECOME THOROUGHLY VERSED IN GREEK POETRY AND PROFICIENT IN THE TEACHINGS OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY
THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO DEVOTE HERSELF TO THE NEWTONIAN SWEEPER WHICH SHE USED TO SUCH GOOD PURPOSE BESIDES THE EIGHT COMETS BY HER DISCOVERED
BESIDE THOSE OF EULER AND LAGRANGE
APART FROM THE INTEREST WHICH ATTACHES TO CAEDMON FROM A HISTORICAL AND LITERARY POINT OF VIEW HIS LIFE DISCLOSES TO US ESSENTIAL PECULIARITIES IN THE OUTWARD ORGANIZATION
WHICH IT HAS BECOME THROUGH THE MARVELOUS DISCOVERIES MADE IN HEAT LIGHT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM DURING THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS AS WELL AS THROUGH THOSE COUNTLESS BRILLIANT INVESTIGATIONS WHICH HAVE LED UP TO OUR PRESENT DOCTRINE OF THE CORRELATION AND CONSERVATION
AND FROM WHAT WE KNOW OF THE LIVES OF THESE TWO REMARKABLE WOMEN WHO AS SAINT JEROME INFORMS US IN THE EPITAPH WHICH HE HAD ENGRAVED ON PAULA'S TOMB IN THE CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY IN BETHLEHEM WERE DESCENDED FROM THE SCIPIOS THE GRACCHI AND THE PAULI ON THE MOTHER'S SIDE
THE MOTHER OF JULIUS CAESAR IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THIS EMINENT MAN WAS AS MUCH INDEBTED TO HIS MOTHER FOR HIS SUCCESS AND GREATNESS
MARTIAL DOES INDEED SPEAK OF A YOUNG MAIDEN IN WHOM WERE COMBINED THE ELOQUENCE OF PLATO WITH THE AUSTERE PHILOSOPHY OF THE PORCH AND WHO WROTE VERSES WORTHY OF A CHASTE SAPPHO BUT THIS WAS EVIDENTLY A GREAT EXAGGERATION FOR WE HAVE NO OTHER EVIDENCE OF HER EXISTENCE
IT WAS ON THIS OCCASION WHEN REFERRING TO THE IMMENSITY OF THE TASK WHICH SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL HAD UNDERTAKEN THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY PAID A DESERVING TRIBUTE TO THE GREAT ASTRONOMER'S DEVOTED SISTER IN WHICH IS FOUND THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT
OR THE WEST OR THE NORTH OF EUROPE THAT LETTERS FLOURISHED IT WAS ALWAYS THE CONVENT OR THE MONASTERY THAT WAS THE HOME OF LEARNING AND CULTURE WITHIN THESE HOLY PRECINCTS
AND RESENTED PARTICULARLY THE PREEMINENCE GIVEN TO PAULA AND HER ACCOMPLISHED DAUGHTER BUT THEIR REPROACHES PROVOKED A REPLY FROM THE SAINT THAT WAS WORTHY OF THE MOST CHIVALROUS CHAMPION OF WOMAN AND REVEALED AT THE SAME TIME
AND A GRAND NIECE OF EDWIN THE FIRST CHRISTIAN KING OF NORTHUMBRIA HER CONVENT AND ADJOINING MONASTERY FOR MONKS SOON BECAME THE MOST NOTED CENTER OF LEARNING AND CULTURE IN BRITAIN
SHE WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO HAVE REACHED THE AGE OF REASON OR EXPERIENCE AND HER NOBLEST EPITAPH IT WAS AVERRED WAS COUCHED IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS SHE WAS GENTLE PIOUS LOVED HER HUSBAND WAS SKILLFUL AT THE LOOM
SUCH A COLLECTION WOULD BE BEYOND PRICE AS IT WOULD COMPLETE THE PICTURE OF THE AGE SO WELL SKETCHED BY SAINT JEROME
LONG ESTABLISHED CUSTOM REQUIRED THAT SHE SHOULD PASS A PUBLIC EXAMINATION ON THE SUBJECT MATTER WHICH SHE WAS TO TEACH FIVE EXAMINERS WERE CHOSEN BY LOT AND ALL OF THEM PROVED TO BE MEN WHOSE NAMES SAYS FANTUZZI
WHEN WE PERUSE THE FRAGMENTARY NOTICES OF THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS AS RECORDED IN THE PAGES OF MORE RECENT INVESTIGATORS REGARDING THE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES OF A CERTAIN CLASS OF WOMEN LIVING IN ATHENS AND THE EMINENCE WHICH THEY ATTAINED IN SCIENCE PHILOSOPHY AND LITERATURE
BUT NO ONE HAS EVER EQUALED THE MAN WHO HAD ONLY GOD FOR A MASTER AND NOT WITHOUT WARRANT DOES THE ELOQUENT MONTALEMBERT IN THE MASTERLY WORK JUST QUOTED PEN THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT DURING THIS PERIOD MANY AND IMPORTANT CHANGES WERE EFFECTED REGARDING THE SOCIAL AND CIVIL STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE FIRST PLACE THE ROMAN MATRON HAD MUCH MORE FREEDOM THAN WAS ACCORDED THE GREEK WIFE DURING THE AGE OF PERICLES
CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF EDUCATED WOMEN THAT LIVED IN THE LATTER DAYS OF THE REPUBLIC AND DURING THE EARLIER PART OF THE EMPIRE AND THEIR WELL KNOWN CULTURE AND LOVE OF LETTERS IT IS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT THEY MAY HAVE WRITTEN MUCH IN BOTH PROSE AND VERSE OF WHICH WE HAVE NO RECORD
WISHED TO EXCLUDE WOMEN FROM ALL PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS THE SENATE AFTER A HEATED DEBATE DECIDED BY A LARGE MAJORITY THAT THE COOPERATION OF WOMEN IN QUESTIONS OF ADMINISTRATION FAR FROM BEING A MENACE AS SOME CONTENDED
SHE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN TO BE ELECTED A MEMBER OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF FRANCE AND THE CHARACTER OF HER WORK AS AN OBSERVER AS WELL AS A COMPUTER HAS GIVEN HER AN ENVIABLE POSITION AMONG THE ASTRONOMERS OF THE WORLD
TREATING OF PHYSICAL SUBJECTS OR OF SUBJECTS INTIMATELY RELATED TO PHYSICS ARE THE FORM AND ROTATION OF THE EARTH THE TIDES OF THE OCEAN AND ATMOSPHERE AND AN ABSTRUSE INVESTIGATION
AND WHO HE DECLARES HELD HER HEAD ABOVE ALL VICES
THUS CICERO TELLS US OF AN INTERVIEW WHICH HE HAD AT ANTIUM WITH BRUTUS AND CASSIUS BESIDES THE MEN THERE WERE PRESENT ON THIS OCCASION THREE WOMEN WHO TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THE DISCUSSION THESE WERE SERVILIA
WHICH WERE CENTERS OF LITERARY ACTIVITY AND OF NUNS WHO DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES BY THEIR LEARNING AND BY THE BENIGN INFLUENCE WHICH THEY EXERTED FAR BEYOND THE WALLS OF THE CLOISTER I CANNOT HOWEVER REFRAIN FROM REFERRING TO THAT GROUP OF LEARNED ENGLISH NUNS
AND WOULD AT THE SAME TIME BE A BITING SATIRE ON THE DEMIGODS OF FRENCH LITERATURE WHO HAD DARED TO EXCLUDE HIM FROM THEIR SOCIETY THAT HE MIGHT NOT MEET THE SAME REFUSAL ON THE PART OF THE ACADEMY OF BOLOGNA AS HE HAD EXPERIENCED IN PARIS
SHE WAS EVEN AT AN EARLY AGE REGARDED AS A MARVEL OF LEARNING FOR
M DARBOUX THE PRESIDENT OF THE JURY COMPLIMENTED THE YOUNG AMERICAN DOCTOR ON HER SPLENDID WORK AND CONCLUDED A NOTABLE ADDRESS IN HER HONOR IN THE FOLLOWING LAUDATORY WORDS
OF THE ZEALOUS AND INTELLIGENT INMATES OF THE CLOISTER OF THE MONASTIC INSTITUTIONS FOR MEN THERE IS NO OCCASION TO SPEAK EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THEY CONTRIBUTED TO THE INTELLECTUAL ADVANCEMENT OF WOMAN IN SOME CASES
FOUND THEIR WAY TO ROME ESPECIALLY UNDER THE EMPIRE THEY WERE ALWAYS KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND AND NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ACHIEVING ANYTHING APPROACHING THE ASCENDANCY WHICH DISTINGUISHED THEM DURING THE TIME OF ASPASIA THEIR INFLUENCE IN LITERATURE AND POLITICS
AND IN BUT FEW FOR MEN MISS MITCHELL WAS A MEMBER OF SEVERAL LEARNED SOCIETIES AND THE AUTHOR OF A NUMBER OF PAPERS CONTAINING THE RESULTS OF HER OBSERVATIONS ON JUPITER AND SATURN AND THEIR SATELLITES
FOR THE NAUTICAL ALMANAC A POSITION SHE HELD FOR NINETEEN YEARS DURING THE SAME PERIOD SHE WAS EMPLOYED BY THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY WHEN VASSAR COLLEGE WAS OPENED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE
FOR MANY YEARS MISSUS W FLEMING
LIKE HER ILLUSTRIOUS COUNTRYWOMAN SAINT HILDA THE ABBESS OF BISCHOPSHEIM WAS THE FRIEND AND COUNSELOR OF SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL RULERS CHARLEMAGNE THAT EMINENT PATRON OF SCHOLARS HAD A GREAT ADMIRATION FOR HER
AND BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT THE WONDERFUL ADVANCE THAT HAD BEEN MADE IN THE GENERAL STATUS OF WOMEN SINCE THE DAYS OF PERICLES AND ASPASIA I HAVE REFERRED TO THEM ALSO
AND HIS INSPIRATION MORE EARNEST AND IMPASSIONED IT WAS THIS NORTHUMBRIAN COWHERD TRANSFORMED INTO A MONK OF WHITBY WHO SANG BEFORE THE ABBESS HILDA THE REVOLT OF SATAN AND PARADISE LOST A THOUSAND YEARS EARLIER THAN MILTON
DOES NOT HESITATE TO DECLARE THAT CERTAIN OF CAEDMON'S VERSES RESEMBLED SO CLOSELY CERTAIN PASSAGES OF THE PARADISE LOST THAT SOME OF MILTON'S LINES SEEM ALMOST LIKE A TRANSLATION FROM THE WORK OF HIS DISTINGUISHED PREDECESSOR
AS THERE WAS NO ATLANTIC CABLE IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS NOT KNOWN WHO WAS THE FORTUNATE WINNER OF THE PRIZE UNTIL NEARLY A YEAR AFTERWARD
IN RECOGNITION OF THE VALUABLE SERVICES RENDERED BY HER AS THE FELLOW WORKER OF HER IMMORTAL BROTHER SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL
BOTH SYMBOLS OF THE DOCTORATE AFTER THIS THE YOUNG DOCTOR PROCEEDED TO WHERE THE THREE CARDINALS WERE SEATED AND IN DELICATELY CHOSEN WORDS ALSO IN LATIN EXPRESSED TO THEM HER THANKS FOR THE HONOR OF THEIR PRESENCE
SHE IT WAS WHO NOTED THE RIGHT ASCENSIONS AND POLAR DISTANCES OF THE OBJECTS OBSERVED SHE IT WAS WHO HAVING PASSED THE NIGHT NEAR THE INSTRUMENT TOOK THE ROUGH MANUSCRIPTS TO HER COTTAGE AT THE DAWN OF DAY
PRESENTED HERSELF AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE DOCTORATE IN PHILOSOPHY THIS WAS THE OCCASION FOR A STILL MORE BRILLIANT AND IMPOSING CEREMONY IT WAS HELD IN THE SPACIOUS HALL OF HERCULES IN THE COMMUNAL PALACE WHICH WAS MAGNIFICENTLY DECORATED FOR THE SPLENDID FUNCTION
THE WIFE OF GERMANICUS IN MANY RESPECTS SHE WAS THE MOST COMMANDING PERSONALITY OF HER AGE AND EXHIBITED IN AN EMINENT DEGREE THOSE STERLING QUALITIES WHICH WE ARE WONT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE STRONG DIGNIFIED COURAGEOUS WOMEN OF ANCIENT ROME
IN VERSES WHICH MAY STILL BE ADMIRED EVEN BESIDE THE IMMORTAL POEM OF THE BRITISH HOMER SO REMARKABLE INDEED IN SOME INSTANCES IS THE SIMILARITY IN THE PRODUCTIONS OF THE TWO POETS THAT F PALGRAVE ONE OF THE MOST COMPETENT OF ENGLISH CRITICS
BY DEDICATING TO THEM A GREAT NUMBER OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS
ALL THE NOBILITY OF SOUL OF THE ROUSED LION OF BETHLEHEM IT IS NOT ONLY A DEFENCE OF HIS COURSE BUT ALSO A SPLENDID TRIBUTE TO HIS TWO ILLUSTRIOUS FRIENDS AND A TRIBUTE ALSO TO THE GREAT AND GOOD WOMEN OF ALL TIME THERE ARE PEOPLE
SHE WAS THEIR TEACHER AND IT WAS HER EDUCATED AND REFINED MIND THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
MORE STRIKINGLY ILLUSTRATES THAN THE TWO INSTANCES GIVEN THE VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE STATUS OF THE WIVES OF GREECE AND ROME OR EXHIBITS MORE CLEARLY THE ADVANTAGES ACCRUING TO EARLY TRAINING AND THOROUGH MENTAL DEVELOPMENT
RUMINATED IT AS A CLEAN ANIMAL RUMINATES ITS FOOD AND TRANSFORMED IT INTO SONGS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT ALL WHO HEARD WERE DELIGHTED AS HIS POETICAL FACULTY BECAME MORE DEVELOPED HIS PROFOUNDLY ORIGINAL GENIUS BECAME MORE MARKED
THE WOMEN OF THE CLOISTER OWED MUCH TO ECCLESIASTICS FOR THEIR LITERARY TRAINING BUT THERE ARE NOT WANTING INSTANCES IN WHICH THE NUNS TOOK THE LEAD IN EDUCATION AND HAD THE DIRECTION OF SCHOOLS WHICH GAVE TO THE CHURCH PRIESTS AND BISHOPS OF RECOGNIZED SCHOLARSHIP
LAURA BASSI WAS IN CONSTANT CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE MOST CELEBRATED SCHOLARS OF EUROPE AND MORE ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE WHO HAD ATTAINED EMINENCE IN HER SPECIAL LINE OF WORK AMONG THE LETTERS RECEIVED FROM HER ILLUSTRIOUS CORRESPONDENTS WERE TWO FROM VOLTAIRE
ROSE AND PRONOUNCED AN ELOQUENT DISCOURSE IN LATIN TO WHICH LAURA MADE A SUITABLE RESPONSE IN THE SAME LANGUAGE
WE HAVE SEEN IN CONSIDERING HER INTELLECTUAL ATTAINMENTS
SHE CONVERSED FLUENTLY WITH ME IN LATIN FOR AN HOUR WITH GRACE AND PRECISION SHE IS VERY PROFICIENT IN METAPHYSICS BUT SHE PREFERS MODERN PHYSICS PARTICULARLY THAT OF NEWTON
ENDOWED WITH A SOUL AND A GENIUS FAR ABOVE THAT OF ORDINARY MORTALS AND AS BEING THE POSSESSOR OF A TALENT THAT INDICATED SOMETHING SUPERHUMAN
IN ALL THINGS MORE COMPARABLE TO THE GODS THAN TO MEN
OR TO DETRACT IN THE LEAST FROM THE SINGULAR AFFECTION WHICH SO CLOSELY UNITED HER TO HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN SHE WAS AS MUCH AT HOME WITH THE NEEDLE AND THE SPINDLE AS SHE WAS WITH HER BOOKS AND THE APPARATUS OF HER LABORATORY
MARY W WHITNEY OF VASSAR MARY E BOYD OF SMITH SUSAN CUNNINGHAM OF SWARTHMORE AND ANNIE S YOUNG OF MT HOLYOKE
IN A MANNER THAT EXCITED THE ADMIRATION AND WON THE PLAUDITS OF ALL PRESENT CARDINAL LAMBERTINI WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THE BRILLIANT DEFENCE WHICH SHE HAD MADE AGAINST THE FIVE TRAINED DIALECTICIANS AND THE EVIDENCE SHE GAVE OF VARIED AND PROFOUND LEARNING
IT DEALS SPECIALLY WITH THE PHILOSOPHY OF LEIBNITZ AND DISCUSSES SUCH QUESTIONS AS FORCE TIME AND SPACE HER VIEWS RESPECTING THE NATURE OF THE FORCE CALLED VIS VIVA WHICH WAS MUCH DISCUSSED IN HER TIME
WITH THE FREE AND HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED ROMAN MATRON WE FIND ALMOST AS MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AS THERE IS BETWEEN A CHILD AND A FULLY DEVELOPED WOMAN ALL THE DIFFERENCE THERE WAS BETWEEN THE UNSOPHISTICATED YOUNG WIFE NOT QUITE FIFTEEN
IT WAS ALSO A FITTING PRELUDE TO SIR JOHN'S CAPE OBSERVATIONS A COPY OF WHICH GREAT WORK SHE RECEIVED FROM HER NEPHEW NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SUBSEQUENTLY
IT IS NOT SURPRISING THEN THAT SHE WAS REGARDED AS AN ORACLE AND THAT ALL CLASSES FLOCKED TO HER AS THEY DID TO THE ABBESS OF WHITBY FOR GUIDANCE AND ASSISTANCE FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS
CONSISTED IN KNOWING HOW TO TAKE THE WOOL AND MAKE A DRESS AND IN SEEING HOW HER MOTHER'S HANDMAIDENS HAD THEIR DAILY SPINNING TASKS ASSIGNED TO THEM CORNELIA ON THE CONTRARY WAS NOT ONLY AS WE HAVE SEEN HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED
AND BY WHICH THEY AT THE SAME TIME REVOLUTIONIZED THE SCIENCE OF THE STARS FOR THEY HAD NOT ONLY TO DESIGN AND MAKE THE SPECULA BUT ALSO THE MOUNTINGS OF THE MIRRORS AS WELL AND IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE MONEY REQUIRED FOR MATERIAL AND WORKMEN
ALTHOUGH IT HAS PRODUCED A NEWTON IF YOUR PROTECTION SHOULD OBTAIN FOR ME THIS TITLE OF WHICH I AM SO AMBITIOUS THE GRATITUDE OF MY HEART WILL BE EQUAL TO MY ADMIRATION FOR YOURSELF
WHICH THE GREAT MAN ACCEPTED WITH TOUCHING HUMILITY AND INCORPORATED IN A REVISED COPY MORE WONDERFUL STILL THE LATIN PSALTER AS IT HAS COME DOWN TO US IS NOT AS IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED
HOW MUCH OF THE LITERARY WORK OF THE WOMEN OF TO DAY WILL RECEIVE RECOGNITION TWENTY CENTURIES HENCE SOME OF IT MAY IT IS TRUE FIND A PLACE IN THE FIREPROOF LIBRARIES OF THE TIME BUT WHO OUTSIDE OF A FEW ANTIQUARIANS WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO READ IT
WHERE FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL WOMEN HAVE BEEN AS CORDIALLY WELCOMED TO MEMBERSHIP IN ITS LEARNED SOCIETIES AS TO THE CHAIRS OF ITS GREAT UNIVERSITIES
HOW DIFFERENT IT WAS IN THE CASE OF LAURA BASSI
AND IS REPRESENTED AS BEING A VERITABLE PRODIGY OF LEARNING FOR AMONG HER MANY CLAIMS TO DISTINCTION SHE IS SAID TO HAVE PUBLICLY TAUGHT NATURAL AND MORAL PHILOSOPHY IN THE SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES OF ATTICA FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS TO HAVE WRITTEN FORTY BOOKS
IN WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED THE HELIOCENTRIC THEORY OF THE PLANETARY SYSTEM WAS PLACED IN THE HANDS OF COPERNICUS ON THE DAY OF HIS DEATH JUST A FEW HOURS BEFORE HE EXPIRED HE SEEMED CONSCIOUS OF WHAT IT WAS
THE FIRST PUBLIC LECTURE OF THE GIFTED YOUNG DOTTORESSA WAS MADE THE OCCASION OF A DEMONSTRATION SUCH AS THE OLD WALLS OF THE UNIVERSITY HAD RARELY WITNESSED HER LECTURE ROOM WAS THRONGED BY THE ELITE OF THE CITY
ON THE EVENING OF OCTOBER FIRST EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN SHE WAS THE DISCOVERER OF A COMET THAT ATTRACTED GREAT ATTENTION BECAUSE IT SECURED FOR HER A MEDAL OFFERED BY THE KING OF DENMARK IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE
OF THE HENRY DRAPER MEMORIAL BY MISSUS HENRY DRAPER IN ORDER THAT THE WORK OF PHOTOGRAPHING STELLAR SPECTRA
LITERARY PRODUCTIONS MUST HAVE MORE THAN ORDINARY VALUE TO SURVIVE TWO THOUSAND YEARS AND ESPECIALLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF SUCH REVOLUTIONS AND UPHEAVALS AS HAVE CONVULSED THE WORLD SINCE THE TIME OF THE PAX ROMANA WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS AT PEACE UNDER AUGUSTUS
BORN IN THE ISLAND OF NANTUCKET IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN SHE AT AN EARLY AGE DISPLAYED REMARKABLE TALENT FOR ASTRONOMY AND MATHEMATICS HER FIRST INSTRUCTOR WAS HER FATHER WHO BESIDES BEING A SCHOOL TEACHER
SHE WHOSE UNFLAGGING TOIL HAD SO GREATLY CONTRIBUTED TO ITS SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION IN THE HANDS OF HER BELOVED BROTHER LIVED TO WITNESS ITS TRIUMPHANT TERMINATION THROUGH THE NO LESS PERSISTENT INDUSTRY AND STRENUOUS LABOR OF HIS SON
THE MOTHERS OF THE GREATEST POETS ARTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS OF ALL TIME BUT IT EXHIBITS RATHER HER GOOD FORTUNE IN BEING ABLE TO EFFECT A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GREATEST STATESMAN OF GREECE
THE SECOND LETTER OF VOLTAIRE IS IN RESPONSE TO ONE RECEIVED FROM LAURA BASSI ANNOUNCING THAT HE HAD BEEN ELECTED TO MEMBERSHIP IN THE BOLOGNA ACADEMY
THE FIRST LETTER WRITTEN IN ITALIAN IS SO CHARACTERISTIC OF THE WRITER THAT IT WILL BEAR REPRODUCTION MOST ILLUSTRIOUS LADY
AND HER POPULARITY FAR FROM WANING WAXED GREATER WITH THE PASSING YEARS AT THE TIME OF LAURA'S ENTERING UPON HER PROFESSIONAL CAREER THE SENATE OF BOLOGNA HAD A MEDAL COINED IN HER HONOR ON THE OBVERSE OF WHICH WAS HER NAME AND EFFIGY
WERE STUDIES SO DIVERSE AS GREEK AND THE HIGHER MATHEMATICS SHE WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE GREAT PHYSICO MATHEMATICAL WORK OF NEWTON AND DID NOT REST UNTIL SHE HAD THOROUGHLY MASTERED THE CONTENTS OF HIS EPOCH MAKING PRINCIPIA
OF HER WE KNOW MORE THAN WE DO OF THE DAUGHTER OF ARISTIPPUS BUT EVEN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACQUISITIONS AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF HYPATIA IS UNFORTUNATELY EXTREMELY MEAGER WE DO HOWEVER KNOW FROM THE HISTORIAN SOCRATES AND FROM SYNESIUS BISHOP OF PTOLEMAIS
BY THE SUCCESS THEY ACHIEVED IN MOLDING THE CHARACTERS OF SOME OF THE GREATEST MEN OF THEIR OWN OR OF ANY AGE IT IS A SPLENDID TRIBUTE THAT CICERO IN HIS ORATOR PAYS TO LAELIA WHEN HE TELLS OF THE PURITY OF HER LANGUAGE AND THE CHARM OF HER CONVERSATION
FAR FROM INTERRUPTING HER STUDIES WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN THE JOY OF HER LIFE LAURA'S UNIVERSITY WORK GAVE NEW ZEST TO THE LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC PURSUITS WHICH HAD ALWAYS SUCH A FASCINATION FOR HER AMONG THE SUBJECTS THAT SPECIALLY ENGAGED HER ATTENTION
RECENTLY READ ME SOME LETTERS WHICH HE AVERRED HAD BEEN WRITTEN BY HIS WIFE I BELIEVED THAT PLAUTUS OR TERENCE WAS BEING READ IN PROSE WHETHER THEY WERE REALLY HIS WIFE'S AS HE MAINTAINS OR HIS OWN WHICH HE DENIES HE DESERVES EQUAL HONOR
AND THE TAKING OF CONSTANTINOPLE BY THE TURKS IN FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE IS USUALLY KNOWN IN HISTORY AS THE MIDDLE AGES BY SOME IT IS CONSIDERED AS SYNONYMOUS WITH THE DARK AGES BECAUSE OF THE DECLINE OF LEARNING AND CIVILIZATION DURING THIS LONG INTERVAL OF TIME
HAS BY NO MEANS BEEN CONFINED TO THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS AS OBSERVERS WRITERS AND COMPUTERS REFERENCE MUST ALSO BE MADE TO THE FINANCIAL AID WHICH THEY HAVE GIVEN TO VARIOUS OBSERVATORIES AND LEARNED SOCIETIES
RULE OF ANCHORESSES PRESUPPOSES IN HIS AUDITORS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN A KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN AND FRENCH AS WELL AS OF ENGLISH IN CERTAIN CONVENTS LATIN WAS ALMOST THE SOLE MEDIUM OF COMMUNICATION
EITHER BECAUSE HE COMPOSES THEM OR BECAUSE HE HAS MADE HIS WIFE WHOM HE MARRIED WHEN A MERE GIRL
AND FOUNDER OF THE CAPITOLINE OBSERVATORY BORN IN EIGHTEEN O EIGHT SHE MANIFESTED AT AN EARLY AGE A DECIDED TASTE FOR ASTRONOMY WHICH WAS CAREFULLY DEVELOPED BY HER UNCLE SHE IT WAS WHO ORGANIZED THE METEOROLOGICO
THERE SHE SOON BECAME PROFICIENT IN A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES AND THEN DEVOTED HERSELF TO THE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS AND ASTRONOMY AFTER SECURING HER BACCALAUREATE AND LICENTIATE IN PARIS
OCCURS THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH TO THE GREAT SUPERIORITY YOU POSSESS AND WHICH HAS SO NOBLY ILLUSTRATED YOUR NAME ON THE HIGH REGIONS OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS YOU ADD MADAM A VARIETY OF INFORMATION IN ALL PARTS OF PHYSICS AND DESCRIPTIVE NATURAL HISTORY
THIS WE SHOULD NOW CONSIDER BUT A NOMINAL SUM BUT SHE MANAGED TO LIVE ON IT
TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S SCHOOL AFTER HIS DEATH AND DOES NOT ANTIQUITY CREDIT HER WITH BEING NOT ONLY A SUCCESSFUL TEACHER OF PHILOSOPHY BUT ALSO A WRITER OF BOOKS OF RECOGNIZED VALUE
EITHER AS OBSERVERS AND COMPUTERS OR AS WRITERS ARE MISS ALICE EVERETT WHO HAS DONE SPLENDID WORK IN THE OBSERVATORIES OF GREENWICH AND POTSDAM MISSES M A ORR MARY ASHLEY ALICE BROWN MARY PROCTOR
ARE BOTH MODES OF MOTION THE SECOND BOOK WRITTEN BY THIS REMARKABLE WOMAN IS ENTITLED INSTITUTIONS DE PHYSIQUE AND WAS DEDICATED TO HER SON FOR WHOSE BENEFIT IT WAS PRIMARILY WRITTEN
OF WHOM MARTIAL WRITES LET EVERY GIRL WHOSE WISH IT IS TO PLEASE A SINGLE MAN READ SULPICIA LET EVERY MAN WHOSE WISH IT IS TO PLEASE A SINGLE MAID READ SULPICIA BUT IF THE FEW AMATORY VERSES THAT ARE CREDITED TO HER
WHEN HOWEVER IN NINETEEN O TWO SHE WAS FORMALLY NOMINATED FOR FELLOWSHIP IN THIS SAME SOCIETY SHE FAILED OF ELECTION BECAUSE THE COUNCIL OF THE SOCIETY DISCOVERED THAT
ALTHOUGH HER CHIEF TITLE TO FAME IS HER NOTABLE WORK IN MATHEMATICAL ASTRONOMY ESPECIALLY HER TRANSLATION OF LAPLACE'S MECHANIQUE CELESTE
AND WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO ITS ADVANCEMENT BY THEIR OBSERVATIONS AND WRITINGS WOULD BE A VERY LONG ONE
SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO REGARD IT AS A SPECIAL GIFT OF GOD WORTHY OF ALL RESPECT AND OF THE MOST TENDER CARE AND IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT THE MORE READILY DEVELOP THE SPLENDID TALENTS OF THIS LITERARY PRODIGY THE KEEN DISCERNING ABBESS
WHO BASES HIS STATEMENTS ON THOSE OF EARLY GREEK WRITERS THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE WOMAN THAT WON DISTINCTION BY HER KNOWLEDGE OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AS EARLY AS THE DAYS OF SOCRATES IN HIS WORK DE LAUDIBUS MULIERUM
AND THE RAPID PROGRESS IN SOCIAL AND INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM THERE WAS A NOTABLE CHANGE IN THE CHARACTER OF THE EDUCATION GIVEN TO WOMEN AT LEAST TO THOSE OF THE WEALTHIER AND PATRICIAN FAMILIES THIS WAS IN GREAT MEASURE
THE FORMER DESIGNATION SEEMS PREFERABLE FOR AS WE SHALL SEE THE LATTER IS MORE OR LESS MISLEADING DURING THE WANDERING OF THE NATIONS IN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES AND THE LONG AND FIERCE STRUGGLES BETWEEN THE BARBARIAN HORDES FROM THE NORTH
BY DAWES IN ENGLAND ON OCTOBER SEVENTH AND BY MADAME RUEMKER
AND PLACES YOU IN AN HONORABLE RANK BESIDE THOSE WOMEN WHO HAVE CONSECRATED THEMSELVES TO THE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS IN THE LAST CENTURY
THOUGH UPON WHAT IT MIGHT CONSIDER NARROW GROUNDS AND FALSE PRINCIPLES
IT MUST NOT HOWEVER BE INFERRED FROM THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY OF LAURA BASSI OR THE ENTHUSIASTIC DEMONSTRATIONS THAT WERE SO FREQUENTLY MADE IN HER HONOR THAT SHE WAS UNIQUE IN THIS RESPECT AMONG HER COUNTRYWOMEN
BEYOND THE SPHERE AND CAPACITY OF WHAT WAS ASSUMED TO BE THE INTELLECTUALLY WEAKER SEX
SHE APPLIED FOR ADMISSION AS A STUDENT TO THE PARIS OBSERVATORY THE DIRECTORS OF THE OBSERVATORY CONSULTED THE STATUTES NO WOMAN HAD HITHERTO PROPOSED HERSELF AS A COLLEAGUE BUT THERE WAS NO RULE OPPOSING IT
AND A GENERAL INDEX OF REFERENCE TO EVERY OBSERVATION OF EVERY STAR IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED BRITISH CATALOGUE
FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH BOTH IN THE NEW AND THE OLD WORLD
SHE IS LIKEWISE TO BE ACCORDED A PROMINENT PLACE AMONG SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATORS FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS TO PHYSICS AND COGNATE BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE CHIEF AMONG THESE ARE HER WORKS ON THE CONNECTION OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
WHO WAS HER PUPIL THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THE MOST RICHLY DOWERED WOMEN OF ALL TIME BORN AND EDUCATED IN ALEXANDRIA WHEN ITS SCHOOLS AND SCHOLARS WERE THE MOST CELEBRATED IN THE WORLD
AND SO ELOQUENT AND EFFECTIVE WAS HER SPEECH THAT SHE NOT ONLY WON HER CASE BUT ALSO WON THE PRAISE OF THE CRITIC QUINTILIAN FOR HER SPLENDID ORATORICAL EFFORT YET MORE A CERTAIN WOMAN IN THE ROMAN POSSESSIONS IN AFRICA
SINCE THEN SOPHIE GERMAIN
IS ABLE TO INVESTIGATE PHENOMENA AND DETERMINE LAWS THAT WERE QUITE UNKNOWN UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO
FOR IT IS PROBABLE THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR INFLUENCE ON JEROME AND THEIR ACTIVE COOPERATION IN HIS GREAT LIFE WORK WE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE LATIN VERSION OF THE SCRIPTURES THAT IS TO DAY KNOWN AS THE VULGATE THIS IS EVINCED FROM THE LETTERS OF THE SAINT HIMSELF
OF THE GREEK MAIDEN WE ARE TOLD THAT BEFORE HER MARRIAGE SHE HAD BEEN MOST CAREFULLY BROUGHT UP TO SEE AND HEAR AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AND TO ASK THE FEWEST QUESTIONS THAT HER WHOLE EXPERIENCE BEFORE HER MARRIAGE
SHOULD IN NO CASE BE APPLIED TO THE WORKS OF A WOMAN LESS SEVERELY THAN TO THOSE OF A MAN THE SEX OF THE FORMER SHOULD NO LONGER BE AN OBSTACLE
PHILOSOPHIAE NATURALIS PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA THE MARQUISE'S FIRST SCIENTIFIC WORK WAS AN INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE NATURE OF FIRE THE FRENCH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES HAD OFFERED A PRIZE FOR THE BEST MEMOIR ON THE SUBJECT
SHE WAS GIVEN A SEAT BETWEEN THE CHANCELLOR AND THE PRIOR OF THE UNIVERSITY WHO IN TURN WERE FLANKED BY THE PROFESSORS AND OFFICIALS OF THE INSTITUTION AFTER THE USUAL PRELIMINARIES OF THE FUNCTION WERE OVER THE PRIOR OF THE UNIVERSITY DOCTOR BAZZANI
NEVER BOUGHT MONARCH HONOR SO CHEAP SHORTLY AFTERWARDS CAROLINE WAS APPOINTED AS ASSISTANT TO HER BROTHER
OF SAN FRANCISCO WHILE YET QUITE YOUNG
WILL ALWAYS BE HELD BY OUR UNIVERSITY IN GLORIOUS REMEMBRANCE
SHE EXHIBITED A SPECIAL INTEREST IN SHOOTING STARS AND PREPARED THE FIRST CATALOGUE OF THESE METEORS OBSERVED IN ITALY IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR SHE DISCOVERED A COMET SHE HAS ALSO LEFT VALUABLE STUDIES ON THE PROBABLE INFLUENCE OF THE MOON ON EARTHQUAKES
NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES SHE HAD TO CONFRONT LAURA ACQUITTED HERSELF WITH EVEN GREATER CREDIT THAN ON FORMER OCCASIONS OF A SIMILAR CHARACTER THERE WAS NO QUESTION IN THE MIND OF ANY ONE PRESENT AT THE EXAMINATION
SECURED FOR HER SO ENVIABLE A PLACE AMONG THE MATHEMATICIANS OF HER TIME AND PLACED ALL ENGLISH STUDENTS OF MATHEMATICAL ASTRONOMY UNDER SUCH DEEP OBLIGATIONS IT IS TRUE THAT SHE EVER MANIFESTED A LIVELY INTEREST IN CELESTIAL PHENOMENA
OF WHICH HE WAS A DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR SHE AS SUIDAS INFORMS US DEVOTED HERSELF TO THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT SHE WAS SOON REGARDED AS THE ABLEST LIVING EXPONENT OF THE DOCTRINES OF PLATO AND ARISTOTLE HER KNOWLEDGE
HAD THEIR CRITICS THE SATIRISTS OF THE TIME
IN WHICH THERE WAS A SMALL TELESCOPE AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN
WHICH TREATS OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF SOME OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GENTLER SEX
AND SO PERSISTENT WAS HER ACTIVITY IN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS THAT IT IS SOMETIMES ASSERTED THAT SHE WAS THE PRIME MOVER OF MOST OF THE PUBLIC ACTS OF BOTH THESE RULERS THIS WOMAN WHOM OVID DESCRIBES AS HAVING THE FEATURES OF VENUS AND THE MANNER OF JUNO
UNTIL SHE ATTAINED SOME PROFICIENCY IN THE RUDIMENTS THEN MOST PROBABLY HER EDUCATION IN THE SCHOLASTIC SENSE CAME TO AN END HER BROTHERS AND BOY SCHOOLMATES IF THEIR PARENTS WISHED IT COULD PROCEED FROM THE PRIMARY SCHOOL TO THE SECONDARY
AND AS A TEACHER HAVE NOT BEEN OVERESTIMATED LIVING IN AN AGE OF PRODIGIOUS MENTAL ACTIVITY WHEN WOMEN AS WELL AS MEN WERE ACTUATED BY AN ABIDING LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR ITS OWN SAKE
SPECIAL ATTENTION HAS BEEN CALLED TO HER AS A TYPE
AND REFLECT ON THE ADVANTAGES THEY ENJOYED AS PUPILS OF THE ABLEST TEACHERS OF THE LYCEUM THE PORTICO AND THE ACADEMY WHEN WE REMEMBER FURTHER THAT THEY LIVED IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF INTELLIGENCE SUCH AS HAS SINCE BEEN UNKNOWN
IS EVIDENCED BY THE HONORS OF WHICH SHE WAS THE RECIPIENT THE FIRST OF THESE HONORS CAME IN THE FORM OF A GOLD MEDAL UNANIMOUSLY AWARDED BY THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY FOR HER REDUCTION OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED NEBULAE
THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE STUDY AND TEACHING OF PHYSICS WAS GREATLY AUGMENTED THE BRILLIANT SUCCESS OF LAURA BASSI AND MARY SOMERVILLE HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT RESULTS
AND AFTER GRAECIA CAPTA ROMAM CEPIT WHEN GREEK IDEAS AND GREEK CUSTOMS WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE CAPITAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD IT WAS STILL THE ROMAN MATRON THAT WAS SUPREME AND ALTHOUGH MANY GREEK WOMEN SOME OF THEM OF RARE BEAUTY AND CULTURE
AND TO SALUTE THE HONOR OF HER AGE AND OF WOMEN THERE IS NOT A BASSI IN LONDON
AND WHO SO EXERTED HER INFLUENCE FOR PEACE DURING THE TROUBLOUS TIMES IN WHICH SHE LIVED THAT SHE LIVES IN HISTORY AS A PEACEMAKER IN MARKED CONTRAST TO THIS GENTLE AND SYMPATHETIC WOMAN WAS THE ENERGETIC AND HEROIC AGRIPPINA
AND FROM THAT TIME ON SHE WAS HIS ASSIDUOUS CO WORKER IN THE STUDY OF THE HEAVENS AFTER TEACHING SCHOOL FOR SOME YEARS SHE BECAME THE LIBRARIAN OF THE NANTUCKET ATHENEUM A
THEN TOO THERE ARE MANY WOMEN WHO OCCUPY IMPORTANT POSITIONS AS PROFESSORS OR ASSISTANT PROFESSORS IN OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
MENTION MUST BE MADE OF THE MISSES ANTONIA C MAURY FLORENCE CUSHMAN LOUISA D WELLS MABEL C STEPHENS
SHE TOO LIKE HER DISTINGUISHED PREDECESSOR IN ATHENS WAS AN INSTRUCTOR IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY
THE EYES OF HER WHO IS GLORIFIED WERE HERE BELOW TURNED TO THE STARRY HEAVENS HER OWN DISCOVERIES OF COMETS AND HER PARTICIPATION IN THE IMMORTAL LABORS OF HER BROTHER WILLIAM HERSCHEL
COULD BE EMBODIED IN A FEW PAGES IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING FACTS WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT TO FIND WOMEN ENGAGED IN THE STUDY MUCH LESS IN THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE DURING ANCIENT TIMES AND YET IF WE ARE TO CREDIT BOCCACCIO
AND THE FULLEST MEASURE OF EDUCATIONAL FREEDOM ENJOYED BY THE ROMAN THAT ASPASIA IN SPITE OF ALL THE ODDS AGAINST HER WAS ABLE TO RISE TO SUCH A PINNACLE OF GLORY DOES NOT PROVE THAT SHE WAS THE SUPERIOR OF HER COUNTRYWOMEN
ANNA WINLOCK ANNIE J CANNON AND HENRIETTA S LEAVITT
AND AS FOR MEN OF THE OLD CONSERVATIVE TYPE A LEARNED WOMAN WAS AS MUCH AN OBJECT OF HORROR AS IS A MILITANT SUFFRAGETTE IN CONSERVATIVE ENGLAND TO DAY
HER INVESTIGATIONS ON THE ELECTRIC ARC AND ON THE SAND RIPPLES OF THE SEASHORE WON FOR HER THE FIRST MEDAL EVER AWARDED TO A WOMAN BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY
AN EXTRAORDINARY MONUMENT TO THE UNEXTINGUISHED ARDOR OF A LADY OF SEVENTY FIVE IN THE CAUSE OF ABSTRACT SCIENCE TO HER NEPHEW SIR JOHN HERSCHEL IT PROVED INVALUABLE AS IT SUPPLIED THE NEEDFUL DATA
WAS THE AMBITION OF SCORES OF ROMAN WOMEN WHO SOON BECAME NOTED FOR THE EXTENT AND VARIETY OF THEIR ATTAINMENTS AS WELL AS FOR THEIR RARE CULTURE AND CHARMING PERSONALITY AMONG THE PIONEERS OF THE INTELLECTUAL MOVEMENT IN ROME
CONSIDERING HER MANIFOLD DUTIES AS A PROFESSOR IN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE MOTHER OF A LARGE FAMILY IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED THAT LAURA BASSI WOULD HAVE MUCH TIME FOR WRITING FOR THE PRESS SHE WAS HOWEVER ABLE TO DEVOTE SOME OF HER LEISURE MOMENTS TO THE CULTIVATION OF THE MUSES
HER VERSES AS WELL AS HER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SCIENCE OF PHYSICS ARE SCATTERED THROUGH VARIOUS PUBLICATIONS BUT THEY SUFFICE TO SHOW THAT THE ACCOUNTS OF HER TRANSMITTED TO US BY HER CONTEMPORARIES WERE NOT EXAGGERATED
WHEN I LISTEN HE DECLARES TO MY MOTHER IN LAW LAELIA FOR WOMEN PRESERVE THE TRADITIONAL PURITY OF ACCENT THE BEST BECAUSE BEING LIMITED IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH THE MULTITUDE THEY RETAIN THEIR EARLY IMPRESSIONS
NO TWO WERE EVER MORE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER OR EXHIBITED GREATER ENTHUSIASM IN THE TASK TO WHICH THEY SO
THAT WERE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THAT MADE CAROLINE HERSCHEL SO VALUABLE AS AN ASSISTANT TO HER BROTHER AND ENABLED HIM TO ACHIEVE THE UNIQUE POSITION WHICH IS HIS AMONG THE WORLD'S GREATEST ASTRONOMERS HAD SHE BEEN ABLE TO DEVOTE ALL HER TIME TO MINDING THE HEAVENS
FOR THE FIRST ONE WHO SHOULD DISCOVER A TELESCOPIC COMET
SHE TOOK PART IN ALL REPUTABLE ENTERTAINMENT WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE BESIDES THIS SHE HAD MORE AND GREATER LEGAL RIGHTS THAN GREEK WOMEN HAD EVER KNOWN
THE PURITY OF DIANA AND THE WISDOM AND CRAFT OF MINERVA
AND ASSISTANT TO HER BROTHER CAROLINE FOUND TIME TO PREPARE A NUMBER OF WORKS FOR THE PRESS AMONG THESE WERE A CATALOGUE OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY STARS OBSERVED BY FLAMSTEED BUT NOT INCLUDED IN THE BRITISH CATALOGUE
FAR MORE NOTABLE HOWEVER THAN THE CONVENTS OF ARLES AND POITIERS WAS THE CELEBRATED CONVENT OF SAINT HILDA AT WHITBY HILDA THE FOUNDRESS AND FIRST ABBESS OF WHITBY WAS A PRINCESS OF THE BLOOD ROYAL
WHICH IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY STUDDED THE COAST OF NORTHUMBRIA AND WHICH WITH ALL THEIR NUMEROUS DEPENDENTS FOUND OFTEN A MORE COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT UNDER THE CROZIER OF SUCH A WOMAN AS HILDA
BUT AFTER TOUCHING IT AND CONTEMPLATING IT FOR A MOMENT HE LAPSED INTO A STATE OF INSENSIBILITY WHICH SOON TERMINATED IN DEATH WITH MISS HERSCHEL THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT ALTHOUGH IN HER NINETY SEVENTH
ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST AS THEY ARE NOT ONLY OPPOSED TO THOSE WHICH WERE HELD BY DESCARTES AND NEWTON BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY ARE IN ESSENTIAL ACCORD WITH THOSE NOW ACCEPTED IN THE WORLD OF SCIENCE ALL THINGS CONSIDERED
AND SO GREAT WAS HER REPUTATION FOR KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM THAT NOT ONLY PRIESTS AND BISHOPS BUT ALSO PRINCES AND KINGS SOUGHT HER COUNSEL IN IMPORTANT MATTERS OF CHURCH AND STATE AS TO THE MONKS SUBJECT TO HER AUTHORITY
BY LAW LET OTHERS STRIVE TO GAIN RENOWN
IF ANY ONE DREAMS HE FOUGHT WITH A CAT THAT SCRATCHED HIM SORELY THAT DENOTES SOME SICKNESS OR AFFLICTION IF ANY SHALL DREAM THAT A WOMAN BECAME THE MOTHER OF A CAT INSTEAD OF A WELL SHAPED BABY IT IS A BAD HIEROGLYPHIC AND BETOKENS NO GOOD TO THE DREAMER
AGAIN LET HERCULES HIMSELF DO WHAT HE MAY THE CAT WILL MEW AND DOG WILL HAVE HIS DAY THE WISDOM OF OUR FOREFATHERS TEACHES US THAT IF A CAT BE CARRIED IN A BAG FROM ITS OLD HOME TO A NEW HOUSE LET THE DISTANCE BE SEVERAL MILES
CHARMS INCANTATIONS SORCERIES SUCKING CHILDREN'S BREATHS STOPPING OUT LATE ON THE TILES CATTERWAULING AND MOLROWING IN THE NIGHT SEASON PROWLING ABOUT THE STREETS AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS AND A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS TOO NUMEROUS AND TOO UNPLEASANT TO MENTION
SAID FOX CHOSE OF COURSE THE SHADY SIDE OF THE WAY AS MOST AGREEABLE I KNEW THAT THE SUNNY SIDE WOULD BE LEFT FOR ME AND THAT CATS PREFER THE SUNSHINE CATS USUALLY BUT NOT ALWAYS FALL ON THEIR FEET BECAUSE OF THE FACILITY WITH WHICH THEY BALANCE THEMSELVES WHEN SPRINGING FROM A HEIGHT
LAY THE ANIMAL UPON YOUR KNEES AND APPLY THE RIGHT HAND TO THE BACK THE LEFT FORE PAW RESTING ON THE PALM OF YOUR LEFT HAND
THAT NINE OUT OF TEN AMONG MY AUTHORITIES WERE PREJUDICED AGAINST THE ANIMAL ABOUT WHICH THEY WROTE AND FURTHERMORE THAT THEY KNEW VERY LITTLE INDEED UPON THE SUBJECT
IDLE YOUNG HOUSEWIFE OR BID THE DEVIL SCRATCH HER THEN NO DOUBT BUT MOTHER NOBS IS THE WITCH AND THE YOUNG GIRL IS OWL BLASTED ET CETERA THEY THAT HAVE THEIR BRAINS BAITED AND THEIR FANCIES DISTEMPERED
THE NATURAL POSTURE IS FORWARD AND OUTWARD SO AS TO CATCH SOUNDS PROCEEDING FROM THE FRONT AND SIDES THE UPPER HALF HOWEVER IS MOVEABLE AND BY MEANS OF A THIN LAYER OF MUSCULAR FIBRES IT IS MADE TO CURVE BACKWARDS AND RECEIVE SOUNDS FROM THE REAR
THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM RHEUMATISM OFTEN FIND THE PRESENCE OF A CAT ALLEVIATE THEIR SUFFERINGS
THE BEWITCHED ONES DETERMINED TO WREAK THEIR VENGEANCE AND THEN IT WAS THAT THE TRUE SATANIC NATURE OF POOR PUSS APPEARED TRAPS WERE SET TO CATCH HER BUT SHE WOULD NOT BE CAUGHT ROPES WERE PURCHASED TO HANG HER BUT SHE WOULD NOT BOW HER HEAD TO THE NOOSE
THAT IF A HAIR OF HER MISTRESS'S HEAD WERE LAID UPON THE ANIMAL'S BACK
THEY WERE PLACED IN ROWS AND A MONKEY BEAT TIME TO THEM AS THE CATS MEWED AND THE HISTORIAN OF THE FACTS RELATES THAT THE DIVERSITY OF THE TONES WHICH THEY EMITTED PRODUCED A VERY LUDICROUS EFFECT
IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND HERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF A FAMOUS WITCH'S FAMOUS CAT YE RATS IN TRIUMPH ELEVATE YOUR EARS EXULT YE MICE FOR FATE'S ABHORRED SHEARS
THOUGH HE IS SADLY MISTAKEN ON THE SUBJECT OF WHICH HE WRITES THESE WERE PROBABLY HIS HONEST OPINIONS BUT WHAT CAN BE SAID FOR A WRITER IN THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA WHO HOLDS FORTH AS FOLLOWS AND IS NOT ONLY IGNORANT OF WHAT HE TALKS ABOUT BUT STEALS BUFFON'S ABSURD PREJUDICES AND PASSES THEM OFF AS HIS OWN
THE CURIOSITY WITH WHICH THEY SPY INTO ALL PLACES AND THE THOROUGH SMELLING WHICH ANY NEW OBJECT INVARIABLY RECEIVES FROM THEM COMMENDS TO US THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE EVEN UNDER DIFFICULTIES CATS HOWEVER WILL NEVER SMELL THE SAME THING TWICE OVER
WITH ROUND PUPILS NOT ELONGATED AS THOSE OF CATS USUALLY ARE IT OCCASIONALLY SUFFERS FROM IRRITATION IN THE EARS BUT THIS HAS NOT AT ALL RESULTED IN DEAFNESS DO YOU KNOW WHY CATS ALWAYS WASH THEMSELVES AFTER A MEAL
TO WHICH IT IS WELL KNOWN PUSS HAS A NATURAL AVERSION SHE IS NOW AS FOND OF THE WATER AS A NEWFOUNDLAND DOG AND TAKES HER REGULAR PEREGRINATIONS ALONG THE ROCKS AT ITS EDGE LOOKING OUT FOR HER GAME READY TO DIVE FOR IT AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE TALKING OF THE CAT'S FONDNESS FOR FISH I SHOULD HOWEVER MENTION
I CANNOT EXACTLY REMEMBER WHAT I DID OR HOW MUCH BUT MY BOOK ABOUT CATS
I HAVE NOTICED THIS OFTEN MYSELF AND HAVE SEEN THEM RUSH ABOUT IN A HALF WILD STATE JUST BEFORE WINDY WEATHER I THINK IT IS WHEN THE WIND IS RISING THAT THEY ARE MOST AFFECTED IT IS STATED IN A JAPANESE BOOK THAT THE TIP OF A CAT'S NOSE IS ALWAYS COLD
THREE TIMES A DAY TO CURE A WHITLOW PUT THE FINGER AFFECTED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR EVERY DAY INTO A CAT'S EAR
THEN THEY RESTED HIM A LITTLE AND THEN RAN HIM AGAIN AND THUS THEY DID FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND NIGHTS TOGETHER
I WILL TELL YOU IN ANOTHER CHAPTER I MEAN TO TRY AND BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING IN THE FIRST PLACE WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE WORD CAT LET US LOOK IN THE DICTIONARY A CAT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR JOHNSON IS A DOMESTICK ANIMAL THAT CATCHES MICE
HERE I THINK ARE SOME PRETTY SENTIMENTS AND SOME VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CAT KIND LET US HOPE THAT THE OTHER CONTRIBUTORS TO THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA KNEW SOMETHING MORE OF WHAT THEY WROTE ABOUT THAN THE GENTLEMAN ABOVE QUOTED AND THESE OPINIONS ARE NOT UNCOMMON
THE ARTERIES WHICH SUPPLY THE BRAIN ON THEIR ENTRANCE INTO THE BASIS OF THE SKULL SUDDENLY DIVIDE INTO A GREAT NUMBER OF MINUTE BRANCHES FORMING A COMPLICATED NETWORK OF VESSELS AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH ON THE WELL KNOWN PRINCIPLE OF HYDRAULICS MUST GREATLY CHECK THE VELOCITY OF THE BLOOD CONDUCTED THROUGH THEM
SHRILL CATS WHOM FIERCE DOMESTIC BRAWLS DELIGHT CROSS CATS WHO NOTHING WANT BUT TEETH TO BITE STARCH CATS OF PURITANIC ASPECT SAD AND LEARNED CATS WHO TALK THEIR HUSBANDS MAD CONFOUNDED CATS WHO COUGH AND CROAK AND CRY
IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE BLACK CREATURE IN A TRYAL OF WITCHES AT BURY SAINT EDMUNDS SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR A WITNESS DEPOSED TO HAVING CAUGHT ONE OF THESE IMPS IN A BLANKET WAITING FOR HER CHILD WHO SLEPT IN IT AND WAS BEWITCHED
I LOVE TO LISTEN TO EM IT MAY BE FANCY BUT SOMEHOW THEY DON'T SEEM TO PLAY SO SWEETLY AS THEY DID WHEN I WAS A GIRL
VIRGIL HAS ALSO MADE THE SUBJECT A THEME FOR POETIC ALLUSION THE CHINESE LOOK INTO THEIR CAT'S EYES TO KNOW WHAT O'CLOCK IT IS
WITH LITTLE BOYS IN THE STREET A CAT IS A DREADFULLY OBJECTIONABLE PLAYTHING ROUGHLY CUT OUT OF A STICK OR PIECE OF WOOD AND SHARPENED AT EACH END THOSE WHOSE WAY TO BUSINESS LIES THROUGH LOW NEIGHBOURHOODS AND WHO VENTURE UPON SHORT CUTS
IN SHAPE OF BODY HE IS LIKE UNTO A LEOPARDE
BLACK CATS ESPECIALLY ARE SAID TO BE HIGHLY CHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY WHICH WHEN THE ANIMAL IS IRRITATED IS EASILY VISIBLE IN THE DARK HERE ARE DIRECTIONS I HAVE FOR PRODUCING THE EFFECT LAY ONE HAND UPON THE CAT'S THROAT AND SLIGHTLY PRESS ITS SHOULDER BONES
WITH THE IMAGINATIONS AND APPREHENSIONS OF WITCHES CONJURORS AND FAIRIES
AS THEY WATCH FOR HOURS TOGETHER BY A MOUSE HOLE OR IN AMBUSH FOR A BIRD IN THEIR NICELY CALCULATED SPRINGS WE ARE TAUGHT NEITHER TO COME SHORT THROUGH WANT OF MERCY OR GO BEYOND THE MARK IN ITS EXCESS
WHO SHALL HANG THE BELL ABOUT THE CAT'S NECK THE MICE AT A CONSULTATION HOW TO SECURE THEMSELVES FROM THE CAT RESOLVED UPON HANGING A BELL ABOUT HER NECK TO GIVE WARNING WHEN SHE APPROACHED BUT WHEN THIS WAS RESOLVED ON THEY WERE AS FAR OFF AS EVER FOR WHO WAS TO DO IT
FOR INSTANCE ALLOW ME TO QUOTE FROM AN ARTICLE IN A POPULAR MISCELLANY NO I CANNOT ABIDE CATS SAYS THE WRITER PET CATS WILD CATS TOM CATS GIB CATS PERSIAN CATS ANGORA CATS TORTOISESHELL CATS TABBY CATS BLACK CATS MANX CATS BRINDLED CATS
WHEN THE ANIMAL IS ALARMED OR FIRST DISTURBED IT NATURALLY DILATES THE PUPIL AND THE EYE GLARES WHEN IT IS APPEASED OR COMPOSED THE PUPIL CONTRACTS AND THE LIGHT IN THE EYE IS NO LONGER SEEN
IT MAY REMIND ONE OF THE PLACID COUNTENANCE AND CALM REPOSE WITH WHICH THE SPHYNX SEEMS TO LOOK FORTH FROM THE SHADOW OF THE PYRAMIDS ON THE CHANGES AND TROUBLES OF THE WORLD THIS LEADS TO THE REMARK THAT CATS AFTER ALL ARE VERY ENIGMATICAL CREATURES
IT WAS SWORN THAT SHE HAD TWO IMPS ONE IN THE FORM OF A KITTEN AND ANOTHER IN THAT OF A MOLE AND THEY LEAPT ON HER SHOULDER AND THE KITTEN SUCKED UNDER HER RIGHT EAR ON HER NECK AND THE MOLE ON THE LEFT SIDE IN THE LIKE PLACE AND AT ANOTHER TIME A SPIRIT WAS SEEN
THERE IS A STORY OF A SEA OFFICER WHO WAS MUCH PLAGUED BY A COUPLE OF SPARKS PREPARED WITH THEIR OFFENSIVE INSTRUMENTS VULGARLY TERMED CAT CALLS AND DESCRIBES HOW THE SQUEAK WAS STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE BY A BLOW FROM THE OFFICER
CONTAINING A THEORY OF THE EARTH A GENERAL HISTORY OF MAN OF THE BRUTE CREATION AND OF VEGETABLES MINERALS ET CETERA OF WHICH MISTER BARR PUBLISHED AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION IN TEN GOODLY VOLUMES THUS IN THIS WORK OF WORLD WIDE CELEBRITY IS THE FELINE RACE DISCUSSED
WAS SAID TO HAVE BOUGHT A PIG IN A POKE TO TURN THE CAT IN THE PAN ACCORDING TO BACON IS WHEN THAT WHICH A MAN SAYS TO ANOTHER HE SAYS IT AS IF ANOTHER HAD SAID IT TO HIM THERE IS A KIND OF SHIP TOO CALLED A CAT A VESSEL FORMED ON THE NORWEGIAN MODEL
THOSE WERE DREADFUL TIMES FOR THE ILL LOOKING OLD LADIES AND THE MORE SO IF THEY WERE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE AN AFFECTION FOR THE FELINE RACE A WRINKLED HAG OF WICKED FAME BESIDE A LITTLE SMOKY FLAME
THAT ALL THE WEIGHT OF HER BODY MIGHT REST UPON HER SEAT BY THAT MEANS AFTER SOME HOURS THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD WOULD BE STOPPED AND HER SITTING WOULD BE AS PAINFUL AS THE WOODEN HORSE
BUT ONCE HAVING LAID IT AT MY FEET AND HAD HIS HEAD SCRATCHED IN RETURN HIS INTEREST IN THE MATTER SEEMED TO CEASE AND HE WENT AWAY WITHOUT AGAIN ATTEMPTING TO TOUCH IT IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE HAD MADE ME A PRESENT OF THE GAME AND AS WE SOMETIMES THINK WHEN WE MAKE ANYONE A PRESENT OF SOMETHING TO EAT IT WOULD BE MORE DELICATE FOR US TO GO AWAY IMMEDIATELY
WHICH HE GAVE WITH SO STRONG A WILL THAT HIS CHILD'S TRUMPET WAS STRUCK THROUGH HIS CHEEK THE CAT CALL USED AT THEATRES IN FORMER TIMES WAS A SMALL CIRCULAR WHISTLE COMPOSED OF TWO PLATES OF TIN OF ABOUT THE SIZE OF A HALF PENNY PERFORATED BY A HOLE IN THE CENTRE
BEING IN THE CONSTANT HABIT OF DIVING INTO THE SEA AND BRINGING UP THE FISH ALIVE IN HER MOUTH AND DEPOSITING THEM IN THE GUARD ROOM FOR THE USE OF THE SAILORS SHE IS NOW SEVEN YEARS OLD AND HAS LONG BEEN A USEFUL CATERER IT IS SUPPOSED THAT HER PURSUIT OF THE WATER RATS FIRST TAUGHT HER TO VENTURE INTO THE WATER
THEN SHED ENOUGH TO FLOAT A DOZEN WHALES AND USE FOR POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS YOUR TAILS
FEW EVEN AMONGST PUSSY'S MOST ARDENT ADMIRERS WHO POSSESS THE FACULTY OF HEARING AND HAVE HEARD THE MUSIC OF CATS WOULD DESIRE THE CONTINUANCE OF THEIR SWEET VOICES YET A CONCERT WAS EXHIBITED AT PARIS WHEREIN CATS WERE THE PERFORMERS
SUPPOSE THEY ONLY FAWN ON US BECAUSE WE HOUSE AND FEED THEM THEY HAVE NO NOBLER PROOFS OF FRIENDSHIP WITH WHICH TO THANK US AND IF THEIR VERY GRATITUDE FOR THIS SELF INTERESTED HIRE BE ADDUCED AS A CRIME ALAS POOR PUSSIES HAD MINETTE BEEN A THOMAS A WHISKERED FUR COLLARED PHILANDER
HE WOULD MOST PROBABLY HAVE SURMOUNTED THAT UNMANLY WEAKNESS AND RECEIVED ALL FAVOURS AS BUT HIS DUE I NEVER SEE A MISSUS MOUSER RUBBING HER SOFT COAT AGAINST ME WITH ROUND UPTURNED EYES BUT I TRANSLATE HER PURR INTO WORDS LIKE THESE
ONE OF THE FRAUDS OF WITCHCRAFT WAS THE WITCH PRETENDING TO TRANSFORM HERSELF INTO A CAT AND THIS LED TO THE CAT BEING TORMENTED BY THE IGNORANT VULGAR
IN FIFTEEN YEARS FROM FIFTEEN EIGHTY TO FIFTEEN NINETY FIVE REMIGIUS BURNT NINE HUNDRED REPUTED WITCHES IN LORRAINE IN GERMANY THEY TORTURED AND BURNT THEM DAILY UNTIL MANY UNFORTUNATES DESTROYED THEMSELVES FOR FEAR OF A DEATH BY TORMENT
AN UNTAMED SCOLD OF FOURSCORE YEAR ABOUT HER SWARMED A NUMEROUS BROOD OF CATS WHO LANK WITH HUNGER MEWED TEASED WITH THEIR CRIES
THE NERVOUS BULBS AT THE ENDS OF A LION'S WHISKERS ARE AS LARGE AS A SMALL PEA BUT AN ENGLISH WRITER DIFFERS FROM HIM THUS EVERY ONE MUST HAVE OBSERVED WHAT ARE USUALLY CALLED THE WHISKERS ON A CAT'S UPPER LIP THE USE OF THESE IN A STATE OF NATURE IS VERY IMPORTANT
MIDST BEDS OF AROMATIC MARUM STRAY OR RAPTUR'D ROVE BESIDE THE MILKY WAY KITTENS THAN EASTERN HOURIS FAIRER SEEN WHOSE BRIGHT EYES GLISTEN WITH IMMORTAL GREEN SHALL SMOOTH FOR TABBY SWAINS THEIR YIELDING FUR
BUT SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE IN THE CAT
AND SHE HATH A LITTLE HELP OF THE EPILEPSY OR CRAMP TO TEACH HER TO ROLL HER EYES WRY HER MOUTH GNASH HER TEETH STARTLE WITH HER BODY HOLD HER ARMS AND HANDS STIFF ET CETERA AND THEN WHEN AN OLD MOTHER NOBS HATH BY CHANCE CALLED HER
BUT EITHER THROUGH FEAR OR FALSEHOOD THEY APPROACH HIM BY WINDINGS TO SEEK FOR THOSE CARESSES THEY HAVE NO PLEASURE IN BUT ONLY TO FLATTER THOSE FROM WHOM THEY RECEIVE THEM VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT FAITHFUL ANIMAL THE DOG WHOSE SENTIMENTS ARE ALL DIRECTED TO THE PERSON OF HIS MASTER
AND WAS SCARCE SENSIBLE OF WHAT HE SAID OR DID THEY SWAM HIM TWICE OR THRICE ALTHOUGH THAT WAS NO TRUE RULE TO TRY HIM BY FOR THEY SENT IN UNSUSPECTED PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME AND THEY SWAM AS WELL AS HE
FOR THE SAME REASON THE ANIMAL BY A CHANGE OF POSTURE OR OTHER MEANS INTERCEPTING THE RAYS IMMEDIATELY DEPRIVES THE OBSERVER OF ALL LIGHT OTHERWISE EXISTING IN OR PERMEATING THE ROOM IN THIS ACTION WHEN THE IRIS OF THE EYE IS COMPLETELY OPEN THE DEGREE OF BRILLIANCY IS THE GREATEST
BUT I CAN FIND NO PARTICULARS UPON THE SUBJECT IN THE WORKS OF WRITERS ON THE WEST INDIES IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND A COMMON EXPRESSION OF CONTEMPT IS TO CALL A PERSON CAT FACED ARTISTS CALL PORTRAITS CONTAINING TWO THIRDS OF THE FIGURE KIT CAT SIZE
STEVENS STATES THAT IN SOME COUNTIES OF ENGLAND IT USED TO BE THOUGHT A GOOD BIT OF FUN TO CLOSE UP A CAT IN A CASK WITH A QUANTITY OF SOOT AND SUSPEND THE CASK ON A LINE THEN HE WHO COULD KNOCK OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE CASK AS HE RAN UNDER IT
WHICH WERE IN REALITY BUT MOLES SCORBUTIC SPOTS OR WARTS WHICH FREQUENTLY GROW LARGE AND PENDULOUS IN OLD AGE AND WERE ABSURDLY DECLARED TO BE TEATS TO SUCKLE IMPS THUS OF ONE JOANE WILLIMOT IN SIXTEEN NINETEEN
AS BEFORE NARRATED THEY TIED TOGETHER THE THUMBS AND TOES OF THE SUSPECTED PERSON ABOUT WHOSE WAIST WAS FASTENED A CORD THE ENDS OF WHICH WERE HELD ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER BY TWO MEN WHOSE POWER IT WAS TO STRAIN OR SLACKEN IT IF THEY FLOATED THEY WERE WITCHES
OF THIS METHOD OF TRIAL BY WATER ORDEAL SCOT OBSERVES THAT A WOMAN ABOVE THE AGE OF FIFTY YEARS AND BEING BOUND BOTH HAND AND FOOT HER CLOTHES BEING UPON HER AND BEING LAID SOFTLY UPON THE WATER SINKETH NOT A LONG TIME
CAN CLASP CAN CLIMB AND CAN STRIKE SIDEWAYS AND SEAT HERSELF AT A HEIGHT UPON A VERY NARROW SPACE THE LATERAL MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAD IN CATS ARE NOT SO EXTENSIVE AS IN THE OWL BUT ARE NEVERTHELESS CONSIDERABLE
GUANAHANI OR CAT ISLAND A SMALL ISLAND OF THE BAHAMA GROUP IN THE WEST INDIES IS SUPPOSED TO BE SO CALLED BECAUSE WILD CATS OF LARGE SIZE USED TO INFEST IT
THAT IT WAS IN THE FORM OF A TOAD AND WAS CAUGHT AND THROWN INTO THE FIRE WHERE IT MADE A GREAT AND HORRIBLE NOISE AND AFTER A SPACE THERE WAS A FLASHING IN THE FIRE LIKE GUNPOWDER MAKING A NOISE LIKE THE DISCHARGE OF A PISTOL
THIS SO CHANGES THE POSITION OF THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY THAT THE BODY MAKES A HALF TURN IN THE AIR AND THE FEET BECOME LOWEST
IT WAS VERY REQUISITE THAT THESE WITCH FINDERS SHOULD TAKE CARE TO GO TO NO TOWNS BUT WHERE THEY MIGHT DO WHAT THEY WOULD WITHOUT BEING CONTROLLED BY STICKLERS BUT IF THE TIMES HAD NOT BEEN AS THEY WERE THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND BUT FEW TOWNS WHERE THEY MIGHT BE SUFFERED TO USE THE TRIAL OF THE STOOL
WHEN THE CAT IS AWAY THE MICE WILL PLAY WHEN CANDLES ARE OUT ALL CATS ARE GREY OTHERWISE JOAN IS AS GOOD AS MY LADY IN THE DARK THE CAT KNOWS WHOSE LIPS SHE LICKS
A MISTER MOODY OF SESMOND NEAR NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE HAD A CAT IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE WHICH HAD BEEN IN HIS POSSESSION FOR SOME YEARS
THE SAME GAME IS CALLED PIGGIE I LEARN BY THE NEWSPAPER THAT A YOUNG WOMAN AT LEEDS NEARLY LOST HER EYE SIGHT BY A BLOW FROM ONE OF THESE PIGGIES OR CATS AND THE MAGISTRATES SENT THE BOY WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF IT TO AN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL ORDERING HIS FATHER
AND FREQUENTLY BROUGHT THEM HOME ALIVE BESIDES MINNOWS AND EELS SHE OCCASIONALLY CARRIED HOME PILCHARDS ONE OF WHICH ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG WAS ONCE FOUND IN HER POSSESSION SHE ALSO CONTRIVED TO TEACH A NEIGHBOUR'S CAT TO FISH
THE SHE CAT GOES WITH YOUNG FROM FIFTY FIVE TO FIFTY EIGHT DAYS AND GENERALLY HAS FOUR OR FIVE KITTENS AT A LITTER WHEN BORN THEY ARE BLIND AND DEAF LIKE PUPPIES THEY GET THEIR SIGHT IN ABOUT NINE DAYS AND ARE ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE REACHING FULL GROWTH
WITH CRITIC CAT CALL SOUND THE STOPS OF WIT IN CHETWOOD'S HISTORY OF THE STAGE
AND AS MANY MORE IN THE COUNTRY AS MADE UP THREESCORE IN THIS WORK HE WAS AIDED BY ONE JOHN STERN AND A WOMAN WHO WITH THE REST PRETENDED TO HAVE SECRET MEANS OF TESTING WITCHCRAFT NOR WAS THEIR ZEAL UNREWARDED BY THE WEAK AND SUPERSTITIOUS PARLIAMENT
IN SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN MARGARET AND PHILIP FLOWER WERE EXECUTED AT LINCOLN THEIR MOTHER WAS ALSO ACCUSED DYING IN GOAL BEFORE PROBABLY OF FRIGHT ADDED TO OLD AGE AND INFIRMITY
EVER SO LONG AGO IT STRUCK ME THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY AND WRITE A BOOK ABOUT CATS I MENTIONED THE IDEA TO SOME OF MY FRIENDS THE FIRST BURST OUT LAUGHING AT THE END OF MY OPENING SENTENCE SO I REFRAINED FROM ENTERING INTO FURTHER DETAILS
AND BEFORE I HAD TIME TO BEGIN TO TELL HIM SAID HE EXPECTED IT WAS VERY LITTLE WHY NOT DOGS ASKED ONE FRIEND OF MINE HITTING UPON THE NOTION AS THOUGH BY INSPIRATION OR HORSES SAID SOME ONE ELSE OR PIGS OR
THE HORSE RIDDEN BY A MAN WHO HAS GOT ANY CAT'S HAIR ON HIS CLOTHING WILL PERSPIRE VIOLENTLY AND SOON BECOME EXHAUSTED IF THE WIND BLOWS OVER A CAT RIDING IN A VEHICLE UPON THE HORSE DRAWING IT IT WILL WEARY THE HORSE VERY MUCH
HE WAS SEIZED AND TESTED THEY WATCHED HIM AND KEPT HIM AWAKE AT NIGHT AND RAN HIM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ABOUT THE ROOM
GOING MUMBLING IN THE STREETS ONE THAT HATH FORGOTTEN HER PATER NOSTER AND YET HATH A SHREWD TONGUE TO CALL A DRAB A DRAB IF SHE HATH LEARNED OF AN OLD WIFE IN A CHIMNEY END PAX MAX FAX FOR A SPELL
PROVIDED PROBABLY TO SUIT THE NATURE OF THEIR FOOD WHICH IS GREEN THE SUBJECT HOWEVER OF THE VARIOUS COLOURS OF THE TAPETUM IN DIFFERENT ANIMALS IS NOT YET UNDERSTOOD
HE WAS DESERVEDLY CONDEMNED AND SUFFERED DEATH HIMSELF AS A WIZARD DOCTOR HARSENET ARCHBISHOP OF YORK IN HIS DECLARATION OF POPISH IMPOSTURES SAYS OUT OF THOSE IS SHAP'D US THE TRUE IDEA OF A WITCH
THE MONODIST CONNECTS HIM WITH CATS OF GREAT RENOWN IN THE ANNALS OF WITCHCRAFT
IT WAS ASSERTED THAT THEY HAD PROCURED THE DEATH OF THE LORD HENRY MOSSE ELDEST SON OF THE EARL OF RUTLAND BY PROCURING HIS RIGHT HAND GLOVE WHICH AFTER BEING RUBBED ON THE BACK OF THEIR IMP NAMED RUTTERKIN
WHEN THESE RAYS REACH THE OBSERVER DIRECT HE SEES THE LAMPS OR LUMINIFEROUS BODIES THEMSELVES BUT WHEN HE IS OUT OF THEIR DIRECT SIGHT THE BRIGHTNESS OF THEIR ILLUMINATION ONLY BECOMES APPARENT THROUGH THE RAYS BEING COLLECTED AND REFLECTED BY SOME APPROPRIATE SUBSTANCE
AND ROLLING ON THE FLOOR WOULD STRIVE TO FREE HERSELF FROM THE OBJECT OF HER FEARS THE POINTING OF A FINGER AT HER SIDE AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A FOOT WOULD CAUSE HER FUR TO BRISTLE UP AND THROW HER INTO A VIOLENT TREMOUR IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FONDNESS OF CATS FOR FISH
CATS HIDE THEIR CLAWS THE WANDERING CAT GETS MANY A RAP THE CAT IS HUNGRY WHEN A CRUST CONTENTS HER HE LIVES UNDER THE SIGN OF THE CAT'S FOOT
WHO DOES LIKE TO BE RUBBED THE WRONG WAY AND WHO OBJECTS TO YOUR TREADING ON HER TAIL NOR IS THE SOFT FOOT WITH ITS SKILFULLY SHEATHED AND EVER SHARP CLAWS WITHOUT A MORAL TOO FOR WHILST THERE IS NOTHING COMMENDABLE IN ANYTHING APPROACHING TO SPITE PASSION OR REVENGE
TO GRIND NO MORE AND DIRE TO TELL COMMISSION'D BY OLD NICK A CATALEPSY MADE AN END OF DICK
BUT EVEN THIS WOULD BE INSUFFICIENT FOR CATS HAVE TO LOOK FOR THEIR PREY IN HOLES CELLARS AND OTHER PLACES WHERE LITTLE OR NO LIGHT CAN PENETRATE HENCE THE CAT IS FURNISHED WITH A BRIGHT METAL LIKE LUSTROUS MEMBRANE CALLED THE TAPETUM WHICH LINES PART OF THE HOLLOW GLOBE OF THE EYE
FOR WE PAY NO RESPECT TO THOSE WHO BEING FOND OF ALL BEASTS KEEP CATS FOR AMUSEMENT THOUGH THESE ANIMALS ARE GENTLE AND FROLICKSOME WHEN YOUNG YET THEY EVEN THEN POSSESS AN INNATE CUNNING AND PERVERSE DISPOSITION WHICH AGE INCREASES AND WHICH EDUCATION ONLY SERVES TO CONCEAL
WHEN THE WITCH FINDER HAD DONE IN NEWCASTLE AND RECEIVED HIS WAGES HE WENT INTO NORTHUMBERLAND TO TRY WOMEN THERE AND GOT THREE POUNDS A PIECE
HANG THESE TOGETHER IN A NET IN A CONVENIENT PLACE AND WHEN ONE OF THEM HAS SCENTED IT HER CRY WILL SOON CALL THOSE ABOUT HER THAT ARE WITHIN HEARING AND THEY WILL RANT AND RUN ABOUT LEAPING AND CAPERING TO GET AT THE NET WHICH MUST BE HUNG OR PLACED
LEST IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED WE DESIRED TO BE ASKED TO STOP AND PARTAKE OF IT TOM THUS DEPARTED NO DOUBT WITH A SIMILAR IDEA NO EXPERIMENT SAYS AN INTELLIGENT WRITER CAN BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THAT OF SETTING A KITTEN FOR THE FIRST TIME BEFORE A LOOKING GLASS THE ANIMAL APPEARS SURPRISED AND PLEASED WITH THE REFLECTION
AND OTHERS FLED THE COUNTRY LUDOVICUS PARAMO STATES THAT THE INQUISITION WITHIN THE SPACE OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS HAD BURNT THIRTY THOUSAND OF THESE REPUTED WITCHES
THIS EXHIBITION WAS ANNOUNCED TO THE PARISIAN PUBLIC BY THE TITLE OF CONCERT MIAULANT THIS WOULD SEEM TO PROVE THAT CATS MAY BE TAUGHT TRICKS WHICH IS NOT GENERALLY BELIEVED BUT IS NEVERTHELESS THE CASE
THE CAT FALL IS THE NAME OF A ROPE EMPLOYED UPON THE CAT HEAD TWO LITTLE HOLES ASTERN ABOVE THE GUN ROOM PORTS ARE CALLED CAT HOLES A CAT'S PAW IS A PARTICULAR TURN IN THE BIGHT OF A ROPE MADE TO HOOK A TACKLE IN
IS MADE FROM THE DRIED INTESTINES OF THE CAT THE LARGER STRINGS BEING FROM THE INTESTINES OF SHEEP AND LAMBS FAIN WOULD THE CAT FISH EAT BUT SHE IS LOTH TO WET HER FEET THE CAT SEES NOT THE MOUSE EVER
BUT WHEN THE IRIS IS PARTLY CONTRACTED WHICH IT ALWAYS IS WHEN THE EXTERNAL LIGHT OR THE LIGHT IN THE ROOM IS INCREASED THEN THE ILLUMINATION IS MORE OBSCURE THE INTERNAL MOTIONS OF THE ANIMALS HAVE ALSO GREAT INFLUENCE OVER THIS LUMINOUS APPEARANCE BY THE CONTRACTION AND RELAXATION OF THE IRIS DEPENDENT UPON THEM
BUT THE WORD HAS ONE OR TWO OTHER MEANINGS FOR INSTANCE IN THIEVES SLANG THE WORD CAT SIGNIFIES A LADY'S MUFF AND TO FREE A CAT TO STEAL A MUFF AMONG SOLDIERS AND SAILORS A CAT MEANS SOMETHING VERY UNPLEASANT INDEED
WHICH MEANS HOW CAN IT HELP BREAKING OR STEALING THAT WHICH IS LEFT IN ITS WAY THAT THAT COMES OF A CAT WILL CATCH MICE A CAT MAY LOOK AT A KING AN OLD CAT LAPS AS MUCH AS A YOUNG KITTEN
HOWEVER WITCHCRAFT MAY HAVE BEEN LAUGHED AWAY AND LAUGHTER HAS BEEN MORE EFFECTUAL TO RID THE WORLD OF IT THAN ROPE OR STAKE THERE ARE STILL TO BE FOUND INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE IN THE EVIL POWERS OF HOOK NOSED CRONES BLACK CATS AND BROOM STICKS IN A SQUALID HUT LIVED A MISERABLE DAME
CROSS LEGGED OR IN SOME OTHER UNEASY POSTURE AND IF SHE WERE REFRACTORY SHE WAS TIED TOO BY CORDS AND KEPT WITHOUT MEAT OR SLEEP FOR A SPACE OF FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS ALL THIS TIME SHE WAS STRICTLY WATCHED
WERE AGNES BRIDGES AND RACHEL PINDER WHO HAD COUNTERFEITED TO BE POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL AND VOMITED PINS AND RAGS BUT WERE DETECTED AND STOOD BEFORE THE PREACHER AT SAINT PAUL'S CROSS AND ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR HYPOCRITICAL COUNTERFEITING THIS HAPPENED IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
LIKE ALL KNAVES THEY KNOW HOW TO CONCEAL THEIR INTENTIONS TO WATCH WAIT AND CHOOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SEIZING THEIR PREY TO FLY FROM PUNISHMENT AND TO REMAIN AWAY UNTIL THE DANGER IS OVER AND THEY CAN RETURN WITH SAFETY THEY READILY CONFORM TO THE HABITS OF SOCIETY BUT NEVER ACQUIRE ITS MANNERS
AS NATURE SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN THEM AN APPETITE WHICH WITH THEIR GREAT ANTIPATHY TO WATER THEY CAN RARELY GRATIFY UNASSISTED MANY INSTANCES HAVE HOWEVER BEEN RECORDED OF CATS CATCHING FISH
WHICH WAS AS BAD AS MOST TORTURES DO BUT IMAGINE A POOR OLD CREATURE UNDER ALL THE WEAKNESS AND INFIRMITIES OF OLD AGE SET LIKE A FOOL IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROOM WITH A RABBLE OF TEN TOWNS ABOUT HER HOME THEN HER LEGS TIED ACROSS
I HAVE A BLACK CAT WHICH IS VERY FAT BUT A WONDERFUL HUNTSMAN AND SURPRISINGLY NIMBLE AT THE CHASE HE IS ALSO AS PROUD OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS AS A HUMAN SPORTSMAN AND BRINGS ME EVERY HEAD OF GAME HE CATCHES SOMETIMES IF I HAVE BEEN OUT WHEN HE HAS CAUGHT HIS MOUSE
BUT THE SPARROW FLEW AWAY THIS VEXED PUSSY EXTREMELY AND HE SAID AS LONG AS I LIVE I WILL EAT FIRST AND WASH MY FACE AFTERWARDS WHICH ALL CATS DO EVEN TO THIS DAY
HE HAS GONE ALL OVER THE HOUSE IN SEARCH OF ME AND AT LAST HAS TAKEN HIS SEAT BY THE FIRESIDE OR OUT IN THE GARDEN AND NURSED THE TROPHY OF HIS PROWESS UNTIL I RETURNED
AND WAVE WITH JOY HIS GRATULATING TAIL THERE SHALL THE WORTHIES OF THE WHISKERED RACE
AND AS SHE SITS UP LIKE A BEAR ON HER HIND LEGS TO ASK FOR SOMETHING WHICH CATS WILL OFTEN DO FOR A LONG TIME TOGETHER YOU MAY SEE THE ADVANTAGE OF A WINNING AND ENGAGING WAY AS WELL WHEN YOU ARE SEEKING A FAVOUR AS WHEN YOU THINK FIT TO DECLINE ONE
IS A KIND OF GEM FOUND CHIEFLY IN SIBERIA IT IS VERY HARD AND SEMI TRANSPARENT AND HAS DIFFERENT POINTS FROM WHENCE THE LIGHT IS REFLECTED WITH A KIND OF YELLOWISH RADIATION SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE EYES OF CATS CATKINS
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE UNFORTUNATE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL WHOSE LIVINGS WERE SEQUESTERED BY THE PARLIAMENT AND WHO WAS SUSPECTED AS MALIGNANT
WHETHER IN PLAY OR IN EARNEST CATS ARE THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF ELEGANCE AS YOUR CAT RUBS HER HEAD AGAINST SOMETHING YOU OFFER HER WHICH SHE EITHER DOES NOT FANCY OR DOES NOT WANT SHE INSTRUCTS YOU THAT THERE IS A GRACIOUS MODE OF REFUSING A THING
WHO PRETENDED GREAT POWERS OF DISCOVERING WITCHCRAFT AND WAS ENGAGED BY THE TOWNSMEN OF NEWCASTLE TO PRACTISE THERE AND ONE MAN AND FIFTEEN WOMEN WERE HANGED BY HIM BUT HE ULTIMATELY SHARED AS HOPKINS DID THE CRUEL FATE HE HAD AWARDED TO SO MANY OTHERS
CARE WILL KILL A CAT ONE SAYS AND YET CATS ARE SAID TO HAVE NINE LIVES LET US HOPE THAT POOR PUSSY WILL NEVER BE PUT TO A WORSE DEATH A MUFFLED CAT IS NO GOOD MOUSER THAT CAT IS OUT OF KIND THAT SWEET MILK WILL NOT LAP
THOSE WHO WISH THEIR CATS TO CATCH MICE I SHOULD ADVISE NOT TO NEGLECT THE CAT'S FOOD A STARVED CAT MAKES A VERY BAD MOUSER BEING TOO EAGER AND HUNGRY FOR THE WORK IT TRIES TO POUNCE UPON ITS PREY BEFORE THE PROPER TIME COMES A GOOD MOUSER DOES NOT EAT THE MOUSE
A CAT CAN LOOK ROUND PRETTY FAR BEHIND IT WITHOUT MOVING ITS BODY WHICH MIGHT BE APT TO STARTLE ITS PREY THE SPINE OF THE CAT IS VERY FULL AND LOOSE IN ORDER THAT ALL ITS MOVEMENTS IN ALL POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE FREE AND UNRESTRAINED
HE BRINGS HIS CAT DICK FROM THE FLOOD AND CONSEQUENTLY THROUGH RUTTERKIN A CAT WHO WAS
BECAUSE A LACERATED WOUND OFTENER FESTERS THAN A SMOOTH CUT FROM A SHARP KNIFE IT IS ERRONEOUSLY SAID THAT CATS FEEL A CUTANEOUS IRRITATION AT THE APPROACH OF RAIN AND OFFER SENSIBLE EVIDENCE OF UNEASINESS ALLUSION MAY BE FOUND TO THIS IN THOMSON'S SEASONS
BUT FORTUNATELY MADE THE DISCOVERY IN TIME TO SAVE ITS LIFE A CAT'S LOVE OF THE SUNSHINE IS WELL KNOWN AND PERHAPS THIS STORY MAY NOT BE UNFAMILIAR TO THE READER ONE BROILING HOT SUMMER'S DAY CHARLES JAMES FOX AND THE PRINCE OF WALES WERE LOUNGING UP SAINT JAMES'S STREET
AND FINALLY A BLUNDERBUSS WAS LOADED TO SHOOT HER LOADED TO THE VERY MUZZLE BY CONJURATIONS AND ENCHANTMENTS WHEN THAT GUN WAS FIRED IT KNOCKED THE HOLDER BACKWARDS AND NEVER INJURED THE BLACK CAT ANOTHER MAN TRIED WITH THE SAME RESULT AND YET ANOTHER
THERE IS AN IDEA THAT WHITE CATS WITH BLUE EYES ARE ALWAYS DEAF BUT A CORRESPONDENT OF NOTES AND QUERIES SAYS I AM MYSELF POSSESSED OF A WHITE CAT WHICH AT THE ADVANCED AGE OF UPWARDS OF SEVENTEEN YEARS STILL RETAINS ITS HEARING TO GREAT PERFECTION
IT WAS A LARGE HOUSE WALLED ROUND VERY CAREFULLY AND SAID TO BE FULL OF PATIENTS IT WAS AT DAMASCUS THAT THE INCIDENT ABOVE RELATED OCCURRED TO MAHOMET HIS FOLLOWERS IN THIS PLACE EVER AFTERWARDS PAID A GREAT RESPECT TO CATS
AND THE LIGHT AIR PERCEIVED IN A CALM BY A RIPPLING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER IS KNOWN BY THE SAME NAME
THE RETINA OR EXPANSION OF THE OPTIC NERVE IS MOST SENSITIVE TO THE STIMULUS OF LIGHT HENCE A WELL MARKED CILIARY MUSCLE CONTRACTS THE PUPIL TO A MERE VERTICAL FISSURE DURING THE DAY WHILE IN THE DARK THE PUPIL DILATES ENORMOUSLY AND LETS IN AS MUCH LIGHT AS POSSIBLE
HE WILL COMMIT A THIEF TO PRISON AND PROSECUTE HIM TO THE DEATH FOR THE CAT SIGNIFIES A COMMON THIEF IF HE DREAMS THAT HE EATS CAT'S FLESH HE WILL HAVE THE GOODS OF THE THIEF THAT ROBBED HIM IF HE DREAMS THAT HE HATH THE SKIN THEN HE WILL HAVE ALL THE THIEF'S GOODS
CONFESSED THAT SHE TOOK A CAT AND CHRISTENED IT ET CETERA AND THAT IN THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE SAID CAT WAS CONVEYED INTO THE MIDDEST OF THE SEA BY ALL THESE WITCHES SAYLING IN THEIR RIDDLES
DRAW CATS TOGETHER AND FASCINATE THEM WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS IN THE NEW MOON GATHER THE HERB NEPE AND DRY IT IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN WHEN IT IS TEMPERATELY HOT
IN HIS OPINION THE CAT IS A USEFUL BUT DECEITFUL DOMESTIC ALTHOUGH WHEN YOUNG IT IS PLAYFUL AND GAY IT POSSESSES AT THE SAME TIME AN INNATE MALICE AND PERVERSE DISPOSITION WHICH INCREASES AS IT GROWS UP AND WHICH EDUCATION LEARNS IT TO CONCEAL BUT NEVER TO SUBDUE
AND REQUIRED BOND OF HIM TO ANSWER AT THE SESSIONS HE ESCAPED INTO SCOTLAND WHERE HE WAS MADE PRISONER INDICTED ARRAIGNED AND CONDEMNED FOR SUCH LIKE VILLANY EXERCISED IN SCOTLAND AND CONFESSED AT THE GALLOWS THAT HE HAD BEEN THE DEATH OF ABOVE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY WOMEN
WHICH IS IN FACT A THIRD EYELID SLIDING OVER THE TRANSPARENT CORNEA BENEATH THE COMMON EYELIDS THIS MEMBRANE IS NOT ALTOGETHER OPAQUE BUT TRANSLUCENT ALLOWING LIGHT TO FALL ON THE RETINA AND ACTING AS IT WERE LIKE A SHADE
IN THEIR NOISELESS TREAD AND STEALTHY MOVEMENTS WE ARE REMINDED OF THE FREQUENT IMPORTANCE OF SECRESY AND CAUTION PRIOR TO ACTION WHILE THEIR PROMPTITUDE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT WARNS US ON THE OTHER HAND AGAINST THE EVILS OF IRRESOLUTION AND DELAY
AND MAUDLIN CATS WHO DRINK ETERNALLY FASTIDIOUS CATS WHO PINE FOR COSTLY CATES AND JEALOUS CATS WHO CATECHISE THEIR MATES CAT PRUDES WHO WHEN THEY'RE ASK'D THE QUESTION SQUALL
FOR OF ATTACHMENT THEY HAVE ONLY THE APPEARANCE AS MAY BE SEEN BY THE OBLIQUITY OF THEIR MOTIONS AND DUPLICITY OF THEIR LOOKS THEY NEVER LOOK IN THE FACE THOSE WHO TREAT THEM BEST AND OF WHOM THEY SEEM TO BE THE MOST FOND
NO VASE THY RELICS RARE TO FAME CONSIGN NO REV'REND CHARACTERS THY RANK EXPRESS NOR HAIL THEE DICK D D NOR F R S THOUGH NO FUNEREAL CYPRESS SHADE THY TOMB
THE REVEREND MISTER WOOD EXPRESSES AN OPINION THAT ON ACCOUNT OF THE SUPERABUNDANCE OF ELECTRICITY WHICH IS DEVELOPED IN THE CAT THE ANIMAL IS FOUND VERY USEFUL TO PARALYSED PERSONS WHO INSTINCTIVELY ENCOURAGE ITS APPROACH AND FROM THE TOUCH DERIVE SOME BENEFIT
AT THE CORNER OF DOWNING STREET NEXT TO KING STREET CALLED THE CAT AND BAGPIPES IT WAS ALSO A CHOP HOUSE USED BY MANY PERSONS CONNECTED WITH THE PUBLIC OFFICES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD GEORGE ROSE
BENEDICAMUS DOMINO
I LOOKED THROUGH TWO OR THREE HUNDRED WORKS OF ONE SORT AND ANOTHER AND AS MANY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND ODD NUMBERS OF DEFUNCT PERIODICALS AND ALTHOUGH I DARESAY I HAVE OVERLOOKED SOME OF THE VERY BEST I HAVE REALLY TAKEN A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE
THEY ARE ORGANS OF TOUCH THEY ARE ATTACHED TO A BED OF CLOSE GLANDS UNDER THE SKIN AND EACH OF THESE LONG AND STIFF HAIRS IS CONNECTED WITH THE NERVES OF THE LIP THE SLIGHTEST CONTACT OF THESE WHISKERS WITH ANY SURROUNDING OBJECT IS THUS FELT MOST DISTINCTLY BY THE ANIMAL ALTHOUGH THE HAIRS ARE OF THEMSELVES INSENSIBLE
ITS EARS ARE NOT SO MOVEABLE AS THOSE OF SOME OTHER ANIMALS BUT ARE MORE SO THAN IN VERY MANY ANIMALS THE SHAPE OF THE EXTERNAL EAR OR RATHER CARTILAGINOUS PORTION IS ADMIRABLY ADAPTED TO INTERCEPT SOUNDS
THE CORNEA OF THE EYE OF THE CAT AND OF MANY OTHER ANIMALS HAS A GREAT POWER OF CONCENTRATING THE RAYS AND REFLECTING THEM THROUGH THE PUPIL PROFESSOR BOHN AT LEIPSIC MADE EXPERIMENTS PROVING THAT WHEN THE EXTERNAL LIGHT IS WHOLLY EXCLUDED NONE CAN BE SEEN IN THE CAT'S EYE
WERE SACRIFICED TO THE ZEALOUS MASTER HOPKINS FOR CATS AND KITTENS WERE FREQUENTLY SAID TO BE IMPS WHO HAD TAKEN THAT FORM HOWEVER HE WAS NOT THE ONLY SCOUNDREL WHO MADE WITCH FINDING A TRADE IN SYKE'S LOCAL RECORDER MENTION IS MADE OF A SCOTCHMAN
ARE IMPERFECT FLOWERS HANGING FROM TREES IN THE MANNER OF A ROPE OR CAT'S TAIL CAT'S MEAT CAT THYME AND CAT'S FOOT
I GIVE THE AUTHOR'S WORDS AS I FIND THEM THE CAT IS A FAITHLESS DOMESTIC AND ONLY KEPT THROUGH NECESSITY TO OPPOSE TO ANOTHER DOMESTIC WHICH INCOMMODES US STILL MORE AND WHICH WE CANNOT DRIVE AWAY
AGAIN NOTHING CAN BE MORE UNJUST THAN TO CALL CATS CRUEL IF SUCH A WORD AS CRUEL COULD BE APPLIED TO A CREATURE WITHOUT REASON FEW ANIMALS COULD BE FOUND MORE CRUEL THAN A ROBIN REDBREAST
IF ANY OF YOU HAVE A SHEEP SICK OF THE GIDDIES OR A HOG OF THE MUMPS OR A HORSE OF THE STAGGERS OR A KNAVISH BOY OF THE SCHOOL OR AN IDLE GIRL OF THE WHEEL OR A YOUNG DRAB OF THE SULLENS AND HATH NOT FAT ENOUGH FOR HER PORRIDGE OR BUTTER ENOUGH FOR HER BREAD
I SHALL NEVER FORGET HOW VEXED AND DISAPPOINTED I WAS AT HEARING THAT DICK TURPIN NEVER DID RIDE TO YORK ON HIS FAMOUS MARE BLACK BESS
ALTHOUGH A CAT CANNOT LICK ITS FACE AND HEAD IT NEVERTHELESS CLEANS THESE PARTS THOROUGHLY IN FACT AS WE OFTEN OBSERVE A CAT LICKS ITS RIGHT PAW FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN BRUSHES DOWN THE CORRESPONDING SIDE OF THE HEAD AND FACE AND WHEN THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED IT DOES THE SAME WITH THE OTHER PAW AND CORRESPONDING SIDE
I KNEW ONE WHICH USED TO OPEN AN OVEN DOOR AFTER THE KITCHEN FIRE WAS OUT AND CREEP INTO THE OVEN ONE DAY THE SERVANT SHUT THE DOOR NOT NOTICING THE CAT WAS INSIDE AND LIGHTED THE FIRE FOR A LONG WHILE SHE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHENCE CAME THE SOUNDS OF ITS CRYING AND SCRATCHING
AND THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SOFT CUSHIONS OF HIS FEET AND THE FUR UPON WHICH HE TREADS THE RETRACTABLE CLAWS NEVER COMING IN CONTACT WITH THE GROUND ENABLE HIM TO MOVE TOWARDS HIS VICTIM WITH A STILLNESS EVEN GREATER THAN THAT OF THE SNAKE WHO CREEPS ALONG THE GRASS AND IS NOT PERCEIVED TILL HE IS COILED ROUND HIS PREY
WHO IN A WORK UPON THE SUBJECT AMONG OTHER THINGS ASSIGNED THIS SOMEWHAT RIDICULOUS REASON FOR ITS PRETENDED INFALLIBILITY THAT AS SUCH PERSONS HAD RENOUNCED THEIR BAPTISM BY WATER SO THE WATER REFUSES TO RECEIVE THEM
ALSO TERMED CAT PIPES IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THERE WAS AN INSTRUMENT BY THAT NAME USED BY THE AUDIENCES AT THE THEATRE
THE THIRD SAID NOBODY WOULD READ IT AND ADDED BESIDES
AND THEREUPON THE TOAD WAS NO MORE SEEN NOR HEARD ALL OF WHICH WAS THE SIMPLE NATURAL RESULT OF THIS CRUEL PROCEEDING BUT WHICH WAS RECEIVED BY JUDGE AND JURY AT THAT TIME OF THE POOR TOAD BEING AN IMP HUTCHINSON IN HIS ESSAY ON WITCHCRAFT SAYS
BUT IT IS NOT SUCH A RARITY AS WE ARE LED TO BELIEVE ON THE CONTRARY SPECIMENS ARE FREQUENTLY OFFERED FOR SALE AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS IT IS ANOTHER GREAT MISTAKE TO THINK THAT CATS HAVE FLEAS THE INSECT INFESTING A HALF GROWN CAT DOES NOT LEAP LIKE A FLEA
YET WAS THE UNFORTUNATE OLD CLERGYMAN CONDEMNED TO DEATH AND EXECUTED IN THE BOOK WRITTEN SOME YEARS AFTER THIS BY MISTER GAUL HE MENTIONS THEIR MODE OF DISCOVERING WITCHES WHICH WAS PRINCIPALLY BY MARKS OR SIGNS UPON THEIR BODIES
TESTING ALL BY THESE MODES OF TRIAL AND ENDING IN THE CRUEL DEATHS OF MANY WRETCHED OLD PERSONS A REACTION AGAINST HIM TOOK PLACE PROBABLY AT THE INSTIGATION OF SOME WHOSE FRIENDS HAD BEEN CONDEMNED INNOCENTLY OR OF THOSE WHO WERE TOO WISE TO BELIEVE IN HIS TESTS
CONSEQUENTLY THOSE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF DIABOLICAL PRACTICES WERE TIED NECK AND HEELS TOGETHER AND TOSSED INTO A POND IF THEY FLOATED OR SWAM THEY WERE GUILTY AND THEREFORE TAKEN OUT AND HANGED OR BURNT IF THEY WERE INNOCENT THEY WERE DROWNED
THEY STAND OUT ON EACH SIDE IN THE LION AS WELL AS IN THE COMMON CAT SO THAT FROM POINT TO POINT THEY ARE EQUAL IN WIDTH TO THE ANIMAL'S BODY IF WE IMAGINE THEREFORE A LION STEALING THROUGH A COVERT OF WOOD IN AN IMPERFECT LIGHT
OH THAT ALL FEMALES MADE SUCH GOOD USE OF THEIR TONGUES CROSS FROM SHEER MELANCHOLY REFLECTING IN THEIR STARVED AND PERSECUTED MATURITY ON THE FONDNESS LAVISHED OVER THE DAYS IN WHICH THEY WERE PET USELESS TOYS AS SOON AS THEY CAN DESERVE AND MAY REQUIRE KIND TREATMENT
AND SINCERELY HOPE THAT I SHALL BE ABLE TO AMUSE YOU BY MY VERSION OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO TELL WITH A GOOD MANY THINGS WHICH HAVE NOT YET APPEARED IN PRINT THAT I HAVE TO TELL MYSELF ONE THING I FOUND OUT VERY EARLY IN MY RESEARCHES AND THAT WAS
THEY WERE ASSURED THESE WERE THE IMPS IN SIXTEEN FORTY FIVE ONE WAS HANGED AT CAMBRIDGE WHO KEPT A TAME FROG WHICH WAS SWORN TO BE HER IMP AND ONE AT GLOUCESTER IN SIXTEEN FORTY NINE WHO WAS CONVICTED FOR HAVING SUCKLED A SOW
WHICH POWER OF BALANCING IS IN SOME DEGREE PRODUCED BY THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE HEEL THE BONES OF WHICH HAVE NO FEWER THAN FOUR JOINTS CATS ALIGHT SOFTLY ON THEIR FEET BECAUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOOT IS A LARGE BALL OR PAD IN FIVE PARTS FORMED OF AN ELASTIC SUBSTANCE AND AT THE BASE OF EACH TOE IS A SIMILAR PAD
HE DOTH DELIGHTE THAT HE ENJOYETH HIS LIBERTIE AND IN HIS YOUTH HE IS SWIFTE PLYANTE AND MERYE HE MAKETH A RUFULL NOYSE AND A GASTEFULLE WHEN HE PROFERETH TO FIGHTE WITH ANOTHER HE IS A CRUELL BEASTE WHEN HE IS WILDE
AS A YOUNG COSTERMONGER HAVING ONE OF HIS FRONT TEETH PULLED OUT TO ENABLE HIM TO WHISTLE WELL LET US HOPE THAT HIS TALENT WAS PROPERLY APPRECIATED IN THE CIRCLES IN WHICH HE MOVED WITH RESPECT TO CAT CALLS OR CAT CALS
AND DISGUSTED WITH HIS COLD WICKEDNESS HIS OWN FAMOUS AND CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THE EXPERIMENT OF SWIMMING WAS TRIED UPON HIMSELF AND THIS WRETCH WHO HAD SACRIFICED SO MANY BY THE SAME TEST WAS FOUND TO BE GUILTY TOO
THEY ARE AS ILL USED AS IF THEY WERE CONSTANT WIVES RATHER UNFAIR ON LADIES OF THEIR EXCESSIVE GENIUS COULD EVERY CAT LIKE WHITTINGTON'S CATCH FORTUNES FOR HER MASTER AS WELL AS MICE WE SHOULD HEAR NO MORE SAID AGAINST THE SPECIES
THE FIRST DAY SAYS LADY MORGAN IN HER DELIGHTFUL BOOK WE HAD THE HONOUR OF DINING AT THE PALACE OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF TORONTO AT NAPLES HE SAID TO ME
