FAR MORE READY TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND EACH HEARING VERY LITTLE OF WHAT THE OTHER SAID MISSUS THORPE HOWEVER HAD ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE AS A TALKER OVER MISSUS ALLEN IN A FAMILY OF CHILDREN
AND ALMOST FORGOT MISTER TILNEY WHILE SHE TALKED TO MISS THORPE FRIENDSHIP IS CERTAINLY THE FINEST BALM FOR THE PANGS OF DISAPPOINTED LOVE THEIR CONVERSATION TURNED UPON THOSE SUBJECTS OF WHICH THE FREE DISCUSSION HAS GENERALLY MUCH TO DO IN PERFECTING A SUDDEN INTIMACY BETWEEN TWO YOUNG LADIES
SUCH AS DRESS BALLS FLIRTATIONS AND QUIZZES MISS THORPE HOWEVER BEING FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN MISS MORLAND AND AT LEAST FOUR YEARS BETTER INFORMED
AND WHOM SHE INSTANTLY JOINED WITH A FIRMER DETERMINATION TO BE ACQUAINTED THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD COURAGE TO COMMAND HAD SHE NOT BEEN URGED BY THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE DAY BEFORE MISS TILNEY MET HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY
HOW SURPRISED I WAS TO SEE HIM AGAIN I FELT SO SURE OF HIS BEING QUITE GONE AWAY
NOR AN EXPRESSION USED BY EITHER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MADE AND USED SOME THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE UNDER THAT ROOF IN EVERY BATH SEASON
MISSUS ALLEN HAD NO SIMILAR INFORMATION TO GIVE NO SIMILAR TRIUMPHS TO PRESS ON THE UNWILLING AND UNBELIEVING EAR OF HER FRIEND
AT LENGTH HOWEVER SHE WAS EMPOWERED TO DISENGAGE HERSELF FROM HER FRIEND BY THE AVOWED NECESSITY OF SPEAKING TO MISS TILNEY WHOM SHE MOST JOYFULLY SAW JUST ENTERING THE ROOM WITH MISSUS HUGHES
NO INDEED I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEN I AM QUITE AT A LOSS ONE THING HOWEVER I MUST OBSERVE THIS DISPOSITION ON YOUR SIDE IS RATHER ALARMING
NO INDEED I SHOULD NOT OH YES YOU WOULD INDEED I KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
WHICH I CAN KNOW NOTHING OF THERE YOU ARE NOT FOND OF THE COUNTRY YES I AM I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED THERE AND ALWAYS BEEN VERY HAPPY
HERE COME MY DEAR GIRLS CRIED MISSUS THORPE POINTING AT THREE SMART LOOKING FEMALES WHO ARM IN ARM WERE THEN MOVING TOWARDS HER
THAT THOUGH CATHERINE'S SUPPORTING OPINION WAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY CALLED FOR BY ONE OR THE OTHER SHE WAS NEVER ABLE TO GIVE ANY
IS HE IN THE HOUSE NOW LOOK ABOUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE I ASSURE YOU I CAN HARDLY EXIST TILL I SEE HIM NO SAID CATHERINE HE IS NOT HERE I CANNOT SEE HIM ANYWHERE OH HORRID
I HOPE I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU AGAIN SOON SAID CATHERINE SHALL YOU BE AT THE COTILLION BALL TOMORROW PERHAPS WE YES I THINK WE CERTAINLY SHALL I AM GLAD OF IT FOR WE SHALL ALL BE THERE
WHAT WOULD NOT I GIVE TO SEE HIM I REALLY AM QUITE WILD WITH IMPATIENCE MY MOTHER SAYS HE IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD SHE SAW HIM THIS MORNING YOU KNOW YOU MUST INTRODUCE HIM TO ME
AND AGAIN SOLICITED TO DANCE BY MISTER TILNEY HIMSELF WITH WHAT SPARKLING EYES AND READY MOTION SHE GRANTED HIS REQUEST AND WITH HOW PLEASING A FLUTTER OF HEART SHE WENT WITH HIM TO THE SET MAY BE EASILY IMAGINED
IN MARRIAGE THE MAN IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN TO MAKE THE HOME AGREEABLE TO THE MAN HE IS TO PURVEY AND SHE IS TO SMILE BUT IN DANCING THEIR DUTIES ARE EXACTLY CHANGED
AFTER PARADING THE ROOM TILL THEY WERE TIRED AND HOW PLEASANT IT WOULD BE IF WE HAD ANY ACQUAINTANCE HERE
AND ALL OUR AGREEABLENESS BELONGS SOLELY TO EACH OTHER FOR THAT TIME NOBODY CAN FASTEN THEMSELVES ON THE NOTICE OF ONE WITHOUT INJURING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER I CONSIDER A COUNTRY DANCE AS AN EMBLEM OF MARRIAGE
DILIGENCE OUR POINT WOULD GAIN AND THE UNWEARIED DILIGENCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD EVERY DAY WISHED FOR THE SAME THING WAS AT LENGTH TO HAVE ITS JUST REWARD FOR HARDLY HAD SHE BEEN SEATED TEN MINUTES
WELL OTHER PEOPLE MUST JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THOSE WHO GO TO LONDON MAY THINK NOTHING OF BATH BUT I WHO LIVE IN A SMALL RETIRED VILLAGE IN THE COUNTRY CAN NEVER FIND GREATER SAMENESS IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAN IN MY OWN HOME
GREAT THOUGH NOT UNCOMMON FROM WHICH ONE OF THE OTHER SEX RATHER THAN HER OWN A BROTHER RATHER THAN A GREAT AUNT MIGHT HAVE WARNED HER
WISHED TO PLEASE AS SOON AS THEY WERE JOINED BY THE THORPES CATHERINE'S AGONY BEGAN SHE FIDGETED ABOUT IF JOHN THORPE CAME TOWARDS HER HID HERSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM HIS VIEW AND WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR HIM
TWELVE O'CLOCK WAS HER PARTING SPEECH TO HER NEW FRIEND OF HER OTHER HER OLDER HER MORE ESTABLISHED FRIEND ISABELLA OF WHOSE FIDELITY AND WORTH SHE HAD ENJOYED A FORTNIGHT'S EXPERIENCE SHE SCARCELY SAW ANYTHING DURING THE EVENING
AND SO I AM AT HOME ONLY I DO NOT FIND SO MUCH OF IT I WALK ABOUT HERE AND SO I DO THERE BUT HERE I SEE A VARIETY OF PEOPLE IN EVERY STREET AND THERE I CAN ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN
SOON AFTER THEIR REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE SET CATHERINE PERCEIVED HERSELF TO BE EARNESTLY REGARDED BY A GENTLEMAN WHO STOOD AMONG THE LOOKERS ON IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HER PARTNER
AM I NEVER TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM HOW DO YOU LIKE MY GOWN I THINK IT DOES NOT LOOK AMISS THE SLEEVES WERE ENTIRELY MY OWN THOUGHT DO YOU KNOW I GET SO IMMODERATELY SICK OF BATH
ALL HAVE BEEN OR AT LEAST ALL HAVE BELIEVED THEMSELVES TO BE IN DANGER FROM THE PURSUIT OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY WISHED TO AVOID AND ALL HAVE BEEN ANXIOUS FOR THE ATTENTIONS OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY
AND THE HONEST RELISH OF BALLS AND PLAYS AND EVERYDAY SIGHTS IS PAST WITH THEM HERE THEIR CONVERSATION CLOSED THE DEMANDS OF THE DANCE BECOMING NOW TOO IMPORTUNATE FOR A DIVIDED ATTENTION
NEAR LONDON THE WHOLE BEING EXPLAINED MANY OBLIGING THINGS WERE SAID BY THE MISS THORPES OF THEIR WISH OF BEING BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HER OF BEING CONSIDERED AS ALREADY FRIENDS THROUGH THE FRIENDSHIP OF THEIR BROTHERS ET CETERA WHICH CATHERINE HEARD WITH PLEASURE
OH CRIED ANDREA LEAPING WITH JOY THEN HE MENTALLY ADDED STILL MY UNKNOWN PROTECTOR I AM NOT FORGOTTEN THEY WISH FOR SECRECY
THE AUDIENCE FELT THAT A STARTLING REVELATION WAS TO FOLLOW THIS OMINOUS PRELUDE WELL SAID THE PRESIDENT YOUR NAME I CANNOT TELL YOU MY NAME SINCE I DO NOT KNOW IT BUT I KNOW MY FATHER'S AND CAN TELL IT TO YOU
IF I HAVE COMMITTED AN ADDITIONAL CRIME PUNISH ME BUT IF YOU WILL ALLOW THAT EVER SINCE THE DAY OF MY BIRTH MY FATE HAS BEEN SAD BITTER AND LAMENTABLE THEN PITY ME BUT YOUR MOTHER ASKED THE PRESIDENT MY MOTHER THOUGHT ME DEAD SHE IS NOT GUILTY
TO PREVENT A VISITOR FROM SHAKING HANDS WITH OR PASSING ANYTHING TO THE PRISONERS IT IS A WRETCHED DAMP NAY EVEN HORRIBLE SPOT MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THE AGONIZING CONFERENCES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THOSE IRON BARS AND YET
KING'S ATTORNEY YES AND IF YOU WISH TO KNOW HIS NAME I WILL TELL IT
THE CHAMPS ELYSEES COME LET US TALK A LITTLE ABOUT MY FATHER WHO THEN AM I YOU SIR YOU ARE MY ADOPTED FATHER
SEE THE PRINCE IS PLUMING HIMSELF SAID ONE OF THE THIEVES HE'S A FINE LOOKING FELLOW SAID ANOTHER IF HE HAD ONLY A COMB AND HAIR GREASE HE'D TAKE THE SHINE OFF THE GENTLEMEN IN WHITE KIDS HIS COAT LOOKS ALMOST NEW AND HIS BOOTS SHINE LIKE A NIGGER'S FACE IT'S PLEASANT TO HAVE SUCH WELL DRESSED COMRADES
BUT WHICH THEY CAN TAKE UP AGAIN INSTANTLY IF YOU ATTEMPT TO INTERCEPT THEIR MOVEMENTS MY FATHER I WILL KNOW WHO MY FATHER IS SAID THE OBSTINATE YOUTH I WILL PERISH IF I MUST BUT I WILL KNOW IT WHAT DOES SCANDAL SIGNIFY TO ME WHAT POSSESSIONS WHAT REPUTATION
CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVEN THE LIONS DEN ONE DIVISION OF LA FORCE IN WHICH THE MOST DANGEROUS AND DESPERATE PRISONERS ARE CONFINED IS CALLED THE COURT OF SAINT BERNARD THE PRISONERS IN THEIR EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE HAVE NAMED IT THE LIONS DEN
THE UNFORTUNATE YOUTH WAS INTREPID IN THE ATTACK AND RUDE IN THE DEFENCE
A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY WHEN THEY SAW THAT THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PRISONER INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO THE TERROR
WELL BE IT SO YOU HAVE CONTINUED YOUR COURSE OF VILLANY YOU HAVE ROBBED YOU HAVE ASSASSINATED WELL I SHOULD SAY IF YOU HAD ME TAKEN TO A PRIVATE ROOM ONLY TO TELL ME THIS YOU MIGHT HAVE SAVED YOURSELF THE TROUBLE I KNOW ALL THESE THINGS
THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY MANIFESTED GREAT SURPRISE BUT ANDREA APPEARED QUITE UNMOVED YOUR AGE SAID THE PRESIDENT WILL YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION
AND WHO NO DOUBT PRACTICED UPON HIM ALL THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO USE IN VAIN ENDEAVORED TO MAKE HIM LOWER HIS EYES NOTWITHSTANDING THE DEPTH AND PROFUNDITY OF HIS GAZE AT LENGTH THE READING OF THE INDICTMENT WAS ENDED ACCUSED SAID THE PRESIDENT
AS HE STEPPED INTO THE OBLONG AND GRATED VEHICLE WHICH THEY CALL THE SALAD BASKET NEVER MIND WE SHALL SEE TO MORROW THEN HE ADDED TURNING TOWARDS BERTUCCIO
GENTLEMEN I KNOW I AM IN THE HANDS OF AN AVENGING GOD WE NEED NO PROOFS EVERYTHING RELATING TO THIS YOUNG MAN IS TRUE A DULL GLOOMY SILENCE LIKE THAT WHICH PRECEDES SOME AWFUL PHENOMENON OF NATURE PERVADED THE ASSEMBLY WHO SHUDDERED IN DISMAY
THE HAND WHICH HAS RETREATED FOR A WHILE WILL BE AGAIN STRETCHED FORTH TO SAVE ME AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I SHALL THINK MYSELF SINKING INTO THE ABYSS WHY SHOULD I RISK AN IMPRUDENT STEP IT MIGHT ALIENATE MY PROTECTOR HE HAS TWO MEANS OF EXTRICATING ME FROM THIS DILEMMA
EVERY ONE TURNED TOWARDS THE PROCUREUR WHO UNABLE TO BEAR THE UNIVERSAL GAZE NOW RIVETED ON HIM ALONE ADVANCED STAGGERING INTO THE MIDST OF THE TRIBUNAL WITH HIS HAIR DISHEVELLED AND HIS FACE INDENTED WITH THE MARK OF HIS NAILS THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY UTTERED A LONG MURMUR OF ASTONISHMENT
YOU YOU SAID THE YOUNG MAN LOOKING FEARFULLY AROUND HIM DO YOU NOT RECOGNIZE ME UNHAPPY CHILD SILENCE BE SILENT SAID ANDREA WHO KNEW THE DELICATE SENSE OF HEARING POSSESSED BY THE WALLS FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE DO NOT SPEAK SO LOUD
WHAT ARE YOU NO LONGER IN POSSESSION OF YOUR SENSES THIS STRANGE UNEXPECTED TERRIBLE ACCUSATION HAS DISORDERED YOUR REASON COME RECOVER THE PROCUREUR DROPPED HIS HEAD HIS TEETH CHATTERED LIKE THOSE OF A MAN UNDER A VIOLENT ATTACK OF FEVER AND YET HE WAS DEADLY PALE
LET US TALK OF THOSE IF YOU PLEASE WHO SENT YOU COME COME YOU ARE GOING ON QUICKLY M
THE JUDGES TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE THE JURY TOOK THEIR SEATS
I UNDERSTAND BERTUCCIO HAS BEEN SENT BY MY PROTECTOR THE KEEPER SPOKE FOR A MOMENT WITH AN OFFICIAL THEN OPENED THE IRON GATES AND CONDUCTED ANDREA TO A ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR THE ROOM WAS WHITEWASHED AS IS THE CUSTOM IN PRISONS BUT IT LOOKED QUITE BRILLIANT TO A PRISONER
I AM NO COMRADE OF THESE PEOPLE SAID THE YOUNG MAN PROUDLY YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO INSULT ME THUS
I WILL RETURN TO MORROW SAID BERTUCCIO GOOD GENDARMES I AM AT YOUR SERVICE AH SIR DO LEAVE A FEW CROWNS FOR ME AT THE GATE THAT I MAY HAVE SOME THINGS I AM IN NEED OF IT SHALL BE DONE REPLIED BERTUCCIO
AND DO YOU DARE SET YOUR FELLOW CITIZENS AN EXAMPLE OF DISORDER WHICH EVEN IN THESE TIMES HAS NEVER BEEN EQUALLED
LOOKED AT BENEDETTO AS IF HE HAD BEEN GAZING AT THE HEAD OF MEDUSA AND BECAME LIVID AS FOR BENEDETTO HE GRACEFULLY WIPED HIS LIPS WITH A FINE CAMBRIC POCKET HANDKERCHIEF YOUR PROFESSION FIRST I WAS A FORGER ANSWERED ANDREA AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE
THE THIEVES HAD ALREADY APPROACHED ANDREA SOME SCREAMING LA SAVATE LA SAVATE A CRUEL OPERATION WHICH CONSISTS IN CUFFING A COMRADE WHO MAY HAVE FALLEN INTO DISGRACE NOT WITH AN OLD SHOE BUT WITH AN IRON HEELED ONE
JUST THEN THE DOOR OPENED AND THE JAILER ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO BERTUCCIO SAID EXCUSE ME SIR BUT THE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE IS WAITING FOR THE PRISONER AND SO CLOSES OUR INTERVIEW SAID ANDREA TO THE WORTHY STEWARD I WISH THE TROUBLESOME FELLOW WERE AT THE DEVIL
THE KEEPER RETIRED NOW SAID THE STEWARD WHAT HAVE YOU TO TELL ME AND YOU SAID ANDREA YOU SPEAK FIRST
FRIGHTFUL THOUGH THIS SPOT MAY BE IT IS LOOKED UPON AS A KIND OF PARADISE BY THE MEN WHOSE DAYS ARE NUMBERED IT IS SO RARE FOR THEM TO LEAVE THE LIONS DEN FOR ANY OTHER PLACE
ANDREA PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE SUCCESSIVE CHARGES WHICH WERE BROUGHT AGAINST HIM
EVERY ONE WAITED ANXIOUSLY MY FATHER IS KING'S ATTORNEY REPLIED ANDREA CALMLY KING'S ATTORNEY SAID THE PRESIDENT STUPEFIED
I DID NOT EVEN WISH TO KNOW HER NAME NOR DO I KNOW IT JUST THEN A PIERCING CRY ENDING IN A SOB BURST FROM THE CENTRE OF THE CROWD WHO ENCIRCLED THE LADY WHO HAD BEFORE FAINTED AND WHO NOW FELL INTO A VIOLENT FIT OF HYSTERICS SHE WAS CARRIED OUT OF THE HALL THE THICK VEIL WHICH CONCEALED HER FACE DROPPED OFF
SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY
WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOREVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK
AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY
DURING THE DAY I WAS SUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MY FRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER
WOULD SUDDENLY EXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES WHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPAST WAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT
THAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THE SHAPES OF OBJECTS
MY RAGE IS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNED LOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVE BUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TO HIS DESTRUCTION
MY FATHER EVEN NOW MIGHT BE WRITHING UNDER HIS GRASP AND ERNEST MIGHT BE DEAD AT HIS FEET THIS IDEA MADE ME SHUDDER AND RECALLED ME TO ACTION
BUT WHY SHOULD I DWELL UPON THE INCIDENTS THAT FOLLOWED THIS LAST OVERWHELMING EVENT MINE HAS BEEN A TALE OF HORRORS I HAVE REACHED THEIR ACME AND WHAT I MUST NOW RELATE
MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
HOW IGNORANT ART THOU IN THY PRIDE OF WISDOM CEASE
AND I FELT A KIND OF PANIC ON SEEING THE PALE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON ILLUMINATE THE CHAMBER THE SHUTTERS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND WITH A SENSATION OF HORROR NOT TO BE DESCRIBED
SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOUR VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR
ON WHICH I KNEEL BY THE SHADES THAT WANDER NEAR ME BY THE DEEP AND ETERNAL GRIEF THAT I FEEL I SWEAR AND BY THEE O NIGHT AND THE SPIRITS THAT PRESIDE OVER THEE TO PURSUE THE DAEMON
AND I WAS LEFT DRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING AND THUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH
THE WIND WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE SOUTH NOW ROSE WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN THE WEST THE MOON HAD REACHED HER SUMMIT IN THE HEAVENS AND WAS BEGINNING TO DESCEND
HAVE YOURSELF DESCRIBED TO BE HIS PROPERTIES THAT THIS WILL PROVE IMPRACTICABLE AND THUS WHILE EVERY PROPER MEASURE IS PURSUED YOU SHOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CANNOT BE
BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
I TREMBLED WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION AS I SAID THIS THERE WAS A FRENZY IN MY MANNER AND SOMETHING I DOUBT NOT OF THAT HAUGHTY FIERCENESS WHICH THE MARTYRS OF OLD ARE SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED
WILL SATISFY MY EVERLASTING HATRED MY COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE WERE INVIGORATED BY THESE SCOFFING WORDS
AND DESIRED AND ARDENTLY PRAYED THAT I MIGHT HAVE HIM WITHIN MY GRASP TO WREAK A GREAT
AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE
A FILM COVERED MY EYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER IN THIS STATE I WAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM
HOWEVER IT WAS HARDLY MORNING AND I MIGHT REASONABLY HOPE TO ARRIVE BY NIGHT
THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH
AS IF TO SEEK SOMETHING THAT I HAD LOST AFTER AN INTERVAL I AROSE AND AS IF BY INSTINCT CRAWLED INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE CORPSE OF MY BELOVED LAY THERE WERE WOMEN WEEPING AROUND I HUNG OVER IT
FROM THE EXECUTION OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THIS OCCASION
I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SIGHT I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS AND BY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP
WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
MISERY ON HIS GREY HAIRS AND DOOMED HIM TO WASTE IN WRETCHEDNESS HE COULD NOT LIVE UNDER THE HORRORS THAT WERE ACCUMULATED AROUND HIM THE SPRINGS OF EXISTENCE SUDDENLY GAVE WAY
TO HIM WHO FEELS HIMSELF PREORDAINED TO CONTEMPLATION AND NOT TO BELIEF ALL BELIEVERS ARE TOO NOISY AND OBTRUSIVE HE GUARDS AGAINST THEM
OUR LOATHING OF DIRT MAY BE SO GREAT AS TO PREVENT OUR CLEANING OURSELVES JUSTIFYING OURSELVES
AROUND THE HERO EVERYTHING BECOMES A TRAGEDY
A TARDY SENSE OF PRUDENCE THAT PROMPTS ONE TO TRY TO SHUT HIS MOUTH ABOUT THE TIME HE HAS PUT HIS FOOT IN IT AGE SOMETHING TO BRAG ABOUT IN YOUR WINE CELLAR AND FORGET IN A BIRTH DAY BOOK
THOU ART LURED ON THROUGH ALL MANNER OF HARDSHIPS AND THERE IS AN END TO THY PEACE OF MIND ART FAIN TO LEAD A LIFE OF PLEASURE YET WHO DOES NOT SCORN AND CONTEMN ONE
A NATION IS A DETOUR OF NATURE
THE SEXES DECEIVE THEMSELVES ABOUT EACH OTHER THE REASON IS THAT IN REALITY THEY HONOUR AND LOVE ONLY THEMSELVES OR THEIR OWN IDEAL TO EXPRESS IT MORE AGREEABLY THUS MAN WISHES WOMAN TO BE PEACEABLE
IF ONE HAS FAILED TO SEE THE HAND THAT KILLS WITH LENIENCY SEVENTY IF A MAN HAS CHARACTER HE HAS ALSO HIS TYPICAL EXPERIENCE WHICH ALWAYS RECURS SEVENTY ONE
AUGUR ONE WHO BORED THE ANCIENTS WITH PROPHECIES
AND I HEARD ONLY PRAISE ONE HUNDRED WE ALL FEIGN TO OURSELVES THAT WE ARE SIMPLER THAN WE ARE WE THUS RELAX OURSELVES AWAY FROM OUR FELLOWS
ONE MAY INDEED LIE WITH THE MOUTH BUT WITH THE ACCOMPANYING GRIMACE ONE NEVERTHELESS TELLS THE TRUTH
HOMOEOPATHY
WE DO THE SAME WHEN AWAKE AS WHEN DREAMING WE ONLY INVENT AND IMAGINE HIM WITH WHOM WE HAVE INTERCOURSE AND FORGET IT IMMEDIATELY
JESUS SAID TO HIS JEWS THE LAW WAS FOR SERVANTS LOVE GOD AS I LOVE HIM AS HIS SON WHAT HAVE WE SONS OF GOD TO DO WITH MORALS
NOT ONLY OUR REASON BUT ALSO OUR CONSCIENCE TRUCKLES TO OUR STRONGEST IMPULSE THE TYRANT IN US
YES BUT ONE RECOVERS IT FROM AMONG THE ASHES EIGHTY FOUR WOMAN LEARNS HOW TO HATE IN PROPORTION AS SHE FORGETS HOW TO CHARM EIGHTY FIVE
NINETY FIVE TO BE ASHAMED OF ONE'S IMMORALITY IS A STEP ON THE LADDER AT THE END OF WHICH ONE IS ASHAMED ALSO OF ONE'S MORALITY NINETY SIX
NINETY EIGHT WHEN ONE TRAINS ONE'S CONSCIENCE IT KISSES ONE WHILE IT BITES NINETY NINE THE DISAPPOINTED ONE SPEAKS I LISTENED FOR THE ECHO
THERE BE BORN A SINGLE LAUGH BETWEEN THE LIDS THE LABORER WILL ACCREDIT HIMSELF WORTHY OF HIS HIRE IN FURTHER EXPLANATION IT SHOULD BE SAID
IT IS BEYOND DOUBT THEN THAT THESE PATHS DO NOT LEAD TO HAPPINESS THEY CANNOT GUIDE ANYONE TO THE PROMISED GOAL NOW I WILL VERY BRIEFLY SHOW WHAT SERIOUS EVILS ARE INVOLVED IN FOLLOWING THEM JUST CONSIDER
THE BOAST OF AN OLD VINTAGE THE BUG A BOO OF AN OLD MAID ALCOHOL A LIQUID GOOD FOR PRESERVING ALMOST EVERYTHING EXCEPT SECRETS
WHERE THERE IS THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE THERE IS ALWAYS PARADISE
OR AN EARTHLY ELIGIBLE WITH MONEY AND A HEART ANTI ROOMS EUPHEMISTIC TERM FOR CANFIELD'S NEW YORK CITY ANTI IMPERIALIST A PATRIOT WHOSE CONSCIENCE WORKS OVERTIME
HE WHO CANNOT FIND THE WAY TO HIS IDEAL LIVES MORE FRIVOLOUSLY AND SHAMELESSLY THAN THE MAN WITHOUT AN IDEAL
A SIGN OF STRONG CHARACTER WHEN ONCE THE RESOLUTION HAS BEEN TAKEN TO SHUT THE EAR EVEN TO THE BEST COUNTER ARGUMENTS OCCASIONALLY THEREFORE A WILL TO STUPIDITY
ONE IS PUNISHED BEST FOR ONE'S VIRTUES
THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS EVERYTHING NOW TURNS OUT BEST FOR ME I NOW LOVE EVERY FATE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE MY FATE
YOU WANT TO PREPOSSESS HIM IN YOUR FAVOUR THEN YOU MUST BE EMBARRASSED BEFORE HIM
ALL SKIN ALIMONY AN EXPENSIVE SOOTHING SYRUP PRESCRIBED BY THE JUDGE FOR A DIVORCEE'S BLEEDING HEART OLD SPELLING ALLAY MONEY ALLOPATHY
ONE BEGINS TO DISTRUST VERY CLEVER PERSONS WHEN THEY BECOME EMBARRASSED EIGHTY NINE DREADFUL EXPERIENCES RAISE THE QUESTION WHETHER HE WHO EXPERIENCES THEM
AGAIN ON HOW SLIGHT AND PERISHABLE A POSSESSION DO THEY RELY WHO SET BEFORE THEMSELVES BODILY EXCELLENCES CAN YE EVER SURPASS THE ELEPHANT IN BULK OR THE BULL IN STRENGTH
WHERE THERE IS NEITHER LOVE NOR HATRED IN THE GAME WOMAN'S PLAY IS MEDIOCRE
CHRISTIANITY GAVE EROS POISON TO DRINK HE DID NOT DIE OF IT CERTAINLY BUT DEGENERATED TO VICE
IT IS A CURIOUS THING THAT GOD LEARNED GREEK WHEN HE WISHED TO TURN AUTHOR AND THAT HE DID NOT LEARN IT BETTER
YES AND THEN TO GET ROUND THEM
WHEN A WOMAN HAS SCHOLARLY INCLINATIONS THERE IS GENERALLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER SEXUAL NATURE BARRENNESS ITSELF CONDUCES TO A CERTAIN VIRILITY OF TASTE MAN INDEED IF I MAY SAY SO IS THE BARREN ANIMAL
OUR VANITY WOULD LIKE WHAT WE DO BEST TO PASS PRECISELY FOR WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT TO US CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF MANY SYSTEMS OF MORALS
THE WILL TO OVERCOME AN EMOTION IS ULTIMATELY ONLY THE WILL OF ANOTHER
EVEN CONCUBINAGE HAS BEEN CORRUPTED BY MARRIAGE
BLUE THE ONLY COLOR WE CAN FEEL INVISIBLE BLUE A POLICEMAN BLUSH A TEMPORARY ERYTHEMA AND CALORIFIC EFFULGENCE OF THE PHYSIOGNOMY AETEOLOGIZED BY THE PERCEPTIVENESS OF THE SENSORIUM
BUT I WAS THERE AND YOU WEREN'T
DEAD OR ALIVE OR WHICH SHOULD THROW ANY LIGHT UPON HIS FATE HAND BILLS PROCLAIMING THIS REWARD AND DESCRIBING THE MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE WERE EXHIBITED IN EVERY BAR ROOM AND OTHER CONSPICUOUS PLACE THROUGHOUT WESTCHESTER AND THE ADJACENT TOWNSHIPS
SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
HE GLANCED AWAY WHILE THE ANGRY COLOUR LEFT HIS FACE HE WAS A LITTLE DAZED BY THE REALIZATION THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO GRAHAM AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO AN ENEMY AS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HOWELLS IN THE OLD BEDROOM HE FELT THE TOUCH OF GRAHAM'S HAND ON HIS SHOULDER I'M ONLY WORKING IN YOUR SERVICE GRAHAM SAID KINDLY
ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO LEARN HOW HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE APPARENT MIRACLES
AND WHITE AND FURNISHED WITH LIGHT AND HEAT HOT OR COLD WATER IF DESIRED
HE WAS AROUSED BY THE TRAMPING OF MEN AROUND THE HOUSE AND STRANGE HARSH VOICES HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW AND GLANCED FROM THE WINDOW IT HAD LONG BEEN DAYLIGHT TWO BURLY FELLOWS IN OVERALLS CARRYING PICK AND SPADE ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
BOWER A SHADY RETREAT IN GENERAL BOWERY A SHADY RETREAT IN NEW YORK BRACE SECURITY FOR THE TROUSERS BRACER SECURITY FOR THE STOMACH BRACELET SECURITY FOR THE PAWN BROKER BRAIN
OR AT THE VERY OUTSIDE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER OR HE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED BY LAPIERRE
PERRY PROFESSED TO HAVE SEEN AND CONVERSED WITH HIM THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT INTERVIEW AND CONVERSATION HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND SAVAREEN HAD RIDDEN NORTHWARD FROM THE GATE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS HE COULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED
BONE ONE DOLLAR THE ORIGINAL PRICE OF A WIFE NOTE ADAM WHO HAD TO GIVE UP ONE BONE BEFORE HE GOT EVE BONNETS A FEMALE HEAD TROUBLE WHICH IS CONTRACTED THE LATTER PART OF LENT AND BREAKS OUT ON EASTER BOODLE
A STRIP OF SAND SKIRTED BY WATER COVERED WITH LADY KILLERS IN SUMMER LIFE SAVERS IN WINTER
HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
BOHEMIA NOT ON THE MAP A LAND FLOWING WITH CANNED MILK AND DISTILLED HONEY AND UNTROUBLED BY CONSISTENCY CONVENTION CONSCIENCE OR CASH
HENCE AN UNATTACHED MAN WHICH ANY LADY MAY STICK STICK TO OR GET STUCK ON BACKBITER A MOSQUITO BALANCE SOMETHING WANTED BY BOOK KEEPERS AND OFTEN LOST BY TOPERS
WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT THIS EFFECTUALLY DISPOSED OF ANY POSSIBLE THEORY AS TO JONATHAN AND HIS WIFE HAVING MISTAKEN SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SAVAREEN SQUIRE HARRINGTON LIKEWISE LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE MAN'S DOINGS ON THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
USUALLY OCCUPIED BY THE INTELLECT BROTHERS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
THE FORMER EASY MANNERED UNCOMMUNICATIVE FOREIGNER HE APPEARED MOREOVER TO HAVE SLEPT PLEASANTLY HIS EYES SHOWED NO WEARINESS HIS CLOTHING NO DISARRANGEMENT HE SPOKE AT ONCE
GAVE ME THE CREEPS TOO MAKES ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE HAS AN ABOMINABLY DEEP PURPOSE IN USING HIS WITS TO HANG ON HERE HE SUGGESTS RESOURCES AS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AS ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE OLD ROOM YOU'LL CONFESS BOBBY HE'S HAD A GOOD DEAL OF INFLUENCE OVER YOU AN INFLUENCE FOR EVIL
BUT THE HORSE WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER IT SEEMED IMPROBABLE THAT TWO LIVING SUBSTANCES OF SUCH BULK SHOULD PASS OUT OF BEING AND LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND THEM THEY MUST LITERALLY HAVE MELTED INTO THIN AIR NO THEY HADN'T AT LEAST THE BLACK MARE HADN'T
I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF SINCE HE CAME BACK GRAHAM ANSWERED IF THERE'S ANY QUEER POWER BEHIND HIS QUIET MANNER MAYBE HE IS PSYCHIC MAYBE HE CAN DO THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'VE WONDERED IF HE HAD WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING IT
IF IT'S SO FAR FETCHED GRAHAM ASKED QUIETLY WHY DO YOU REVOLT FROM THE IDEA BOBBY TURNED ON HIM AND WHY DO YOU FILL MY MIND WITH SUCH THOUGHTS IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY SAY SO GO TELL ROBINSON SO
GRAHAM FROWNED IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH YOUR SLEEP WALKING LAST NIGHT YET IT'S AS CLEAR AS EVER THAT MARIA AND HE ARE UP TO SOME GAME IN WHICH YOU FIGURE HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL BOBBY PERSISTED GET UP GRAHAM ADVISED
BOBBY HANDED HIM A BANKNOTE HE DIDN'T MISS GRAHAM'S MEANING GLANCE
SCRATCHED AND WITH BROKEN HANDLES THE CLOSED COLONIAL DESK THE MISERLY RAG CARPET ALL SEEMED MUTELY ASKING AS BOBBY DID
MISSUS SAVAREEN SAT UP WAITING FOR HER LORD UNTIL LONG PAST MIDNIGHT BUT HER VIGIL WAS IN VAIN LAPIERRE AFTER CLOSING UP HIS INN FOR THE NIGHT DROPPED IN ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE TO SEE IF ANY NEWS OF THE ABSENTEE HAD ARRIVED
WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
MONEY BORN OF POOR BUT DISHONEST PARENTS
DISTINGUISHED FROM MENU BY FIGURES IN THE RIGHT HAND COLUMN BIOGRAPH A STEREOPTICON PICTURE TAKEN WITH A CHILL AND SHOWN WITH TREMORS BIRDIE
AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EVIDENCE BOBBY DEFENDED HIMSELF IF IT HAD BEEN STOLEN EARLIER THE COAT POCKET MIGHT HAVE RETAINED ITS BULGING SHAPE
YOU SEE I SPENT A GOOD DEAL IN SMITHTOWN YESTERDAY
IN FACT HE HAD NOT WORN IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PREVIOUSLY HIS WIFE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING FOLDED AND LAID IT AWAY IN THE TOP OF A LARGE TRUNK ON THE SATURDAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST SINCE WHICH TIME SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON IT HERE WAS A DEEPENING OF THE MYSTERY
MAY BE FOUND IN A CASH BOOK OR THE KANGAROO GAIT BANDIT AN OUTLAW SEE ALDERMAN BARBER A BRILLIANT CONVERSATIONALIST WHO OCCASIONALLY SHAVES AND CUTS HAIR
FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
AND DEPOSITED ON A DRY PATCH OF GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE MORASS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE INTERIOR THEY CAME UPON A MAN'S COAT MADE OF DARK BROWN STUFF
EACH PERSON HAS HIS OWN IDEA OF THE RELATIVE VALUES ATTACHED TO HUMAN ACTIONS
FROM THE BEGINNING OF ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT DOWN TO THE BIRTH OF THE UNITED STATES AND EVEN TO THE PRESENT TIME FURNISHES AMPLE PROOF OF THIS AND STILL THE UNSUCCESSFUL REVOLUTIONIST MEETS WITH THE SEVEREST PENALTIES TO HIM
HE FEELS THAT HE DOES NO WRONG IF HE APPROPRIATES THE ORE ELABORATE MEANS ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT THIS EVEN COMPELLING THE ABSOLUTE STRIPPING OF THE WORKMAN AND A COMPLETE CHANGE OF CLOTHES ON GOING IN AND COMING OUT OF THE MINE
IT IS EASY TO DISTINGUISH THIS SORT OF ACTION FROM THE THINGS DONE BY THOSE WHO ARE KNOWN AS CRIMINALS THEIR ACTS ARE DONE TO SERVE PERSONAL ENDS
FOR EXAMPLE THE REVENUE LAWS THESE ARE CLEAR AND EXPLICIT AND YET MEN TAKE EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE TO HAVE THEIR PROPERTY EXEMPTED FROM TAXATION IN OTHER WORDS TO DEFRAUD THE STATE
AND THE LAST TIME HE SAID HE THOUGHT OF ASKING THE DIRECTORS TO GIVE ME A FIFTY POUND NOTE SO I COULD GO HOME TO MY FRIENDS IN IRELAND POOR M'GARRY HE RECEIVED RATHER BETTER PAY THAN THE OTHER MEN BECAUSE HE WAS AMBITIOUS AND TOOK SHIFTS
AND CUT EACH OTHER'S THROATS AND OURS IN THE BARGAIN IF WE DON'T BELONG TO A STRONG UNION WITHOUT GOING FURTHER INTO THE ARGUMENT THIS MAN ON THE MILE END WASTE POINTED THE MORAL THAT WHEN TWO MEN WERE AFTER THE ONE JOB WAGES WERE BOUND TO FALL
IS INTERESTED IN KEEPING IT ALIVE AND THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FEAR LOSING THEIR VOTES SOCIAL IDEAS ARE ALWAYS CHANGING NO LAWS OR CUSTOMS ARE ETERNAL THE ORDINARY MAN AND ESPECIALLY THE MAN UNDER THE NORMAL
AND A SHOCK TO THE CONSCIENCE IS FAR MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT A LAW IS BROKEN FOR THE MOST PART THE PROMPTINGS OF CONSCIENCE FOLLOW PRETTY CLOSELY THE INHIBITIONS OF THE CRIMINAL CODE ALTHOUGH THEY MAY OR MAY NOT FOLLOW THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW
A CUTTING OUR THROATS RIGHT ALONG YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM WAS THE ANSWER THEY'RE JUST LIKE US AND THEY'VE GOT TO LIVE DON'T BLAME THE MAN WHO OFFERS TO WORK CHEAPER THAN YOU AND GETS YOUR JOB BUT OW ABOUT THE WIFE AN KIDDIES HIS INTERLOCUTOR DEMANDED
THIS IS DONE ON THE EXCUSE THAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES IT AND THE MAN WHO MAKES A STRICT RETURN ACCORDING TO LAW WOULD PAY THE TAXES OF THE SHIRKERS WHILE THIS IS TRUE IT SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ALL MEN VIOLATE THE LAW
THERE IS A GENERAL DECLINE IN WAGES THROUGHOUT THE LAND WHICH GIVING RISE TO LABOUR DISPUTES AND STRIKES IS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THE UNEMPLOYED WHO GLADLY PICK UP THE TOOLS THROWN DOWN BY THE STRIKERS SWEATING
THERE YOU ARE CAME THE ANSWER HOW ABOUT THE WIFE AND KIDDIES OF THE MAN WHO WORKS CHEAPER THAN YOU AND GETS YOUR JOB EH HOW ABOUT HIS WIFE AND KIDDIES HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN THEM THAN IN YOURS AND HE CAN'T SEE THEM STARVE SO HE CUTS THE PRICE OF LABOUR AND OUT YOU GO
IS NECESSARY TO SOCIAL LIFE THIS MEANS PUTTING NEW WINE INTO OLD BOTTLES AND WINE THAT IS MUCH TOO STRONG FOR THE BOTTLES EVERYBODY CAN SEE WHY SOME PARTICULAR LAW MIGHT BE VIOLATED
WHILE CROSSING THE YARD I FELT SOMETHING TAKE HOLD OF MY LEG AND SCREW IT OFF I BECAME UNCONSCIOUS
THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO WILL USE THE STRONGEST AND HIGHEST EMOTIONS OF MEN TO SERVE THEIR PRIVATE SORDID ENDS CHANGING SOCIAL SYSTEMS NEW POLITICAL IDEAS THE LABOR CAUSE
THAT THE LEAST EFFICIENT MUST DESCEND TO THE VERY BOTTOM WHICH IS THE SHAMBLES WHEREIN THEY PERISH MISERABLY A GLANCE AT THE CONFIRMED INEFFICIENTS AT THE BOTTOM
FOR FAR LESS RETURN I HAVE DEPICTED THE NIGHTS THEY SPEND AND HOW DRIVEN IN BY PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION THEY GO TO THE CASUAL WARD FOR A REST UP NOR IS THE CASUAL WARD A SOFT SNAP
ARE IMBUED WITH THE WILL TO LIVE AND THEY TAKE ALL MEANS IN THEIR POWER TO GO ON LIVING THE PHILOSOPHER CAN NEITHER QUARREL WITH THE IDEALIST WHO MAKES THE SACRIFICE NOR THE ORGANIZATION THAT PRESERVES ITSELF WHILE IT CAN
IS QUITE SHORT TO THOSE WHO FEEL THE INJUSTICE AND PUT THEIR IDEAS IN FORCE BY TAKING PROPERTY WHEN AND WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO GET IT FOR INSTANCE
AND THERE YOU ARE AGAIN RIGHT ON THE HEAD THE UNION CHEEKS COMPETITION AMONG THE LABOURERS BUT MAKES IT HARDER WHERE THERE ARE NO UNIONS THERE'S WHERE YOUR CHEAP LABOUR OF WHITECHAPEL COMES IN THEY'RE UNSKILLED AND HAVE NO UNIONS
AND IN LONDON YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT ONE ADULT IN EVERY FOUR DIES ON PUBLIC CHARITY EITHER IN THE WORKHOUSE THE HOSPITAL OR THE ASYLUM
WILL BUY HIM THREE FAIR MEALS A BED AT NIGHT AND LEAVE HIM A COUPLE OF PENNIES FOR POCKET MONEY HE WOULD RATHER WORK FOR THOSE TWO SHILLINGS THAN FOR THE CHARITY OF THE CASUAL WARD FOR HE KNOWS THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO WORK SO HARD AND THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SO ABOMINABLY TREATED
THE OTHER TWO NO MATTER HOW CAPABLE THEY MAY BE WILL NONE THE LESS BE INEFFICIENTS IF GERMANY JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES SHOULD CAPTURE THE ENTIRE WORLD MARKET FOR IRON COAL AND TEXTILES
THEN TOO EVERY STATE OR NATION CARRIES A LARGE LIST OF LAWS THAT MEN HAVE SO LONG VIOLATED AND IGNORED THAT THEY VIRTUALLY ARE DEAD TO VIOLATE THESE BRINGS NO FEELING OF WRONG
AND HAVE COVERED THE HOLE UP WITH A PIECE OF SHEET IRON THEY GAVE ME TWENTY FIVE POUNDS THEY DIDN'T RECKON THAT AS COMPENSATION THEY SAID IT WAS ONLY FOR CHARITY'S SAKE OUT OF THAT I PAID NINE POUNDS FOR A MACHINE BY WHICH TO WHEEL MYSELF ABOUT
AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW A GOOD WORKER MAY SUDDENLY BECOME INEFFICIENT AND WHAT THEN HAPPENS TO HIM I AM TEMPTED TO GIVE THE CASE OF M'GARRY A MAN THIRTY TWO YEARS OF AGE AND AN INMATE OF THE WORKHOUSE
PROBABLY THE CHIEF BARRIER TO THE COMMISSION OF CRIME IS THE FEELING OF RIGHT AND WRONG CONNECTED WITH THE DOING OR NOT DOING OF PARTICULAR ACTS ALL MEN HAVE A MORE OR LESS BINDING CONSCIENCE THIS IS THE RESULT OF LONG TEACHING
NOW HERE ONE CAN STEP OUT OF DOORS AND GET A THING IN FIVE MINUTES MISTER TILNEY WAS POLITE ENOUGH TO SEEM INTERESTED IN WHAT SHE SAID AND SHE KEPT HIM ON THE SUBJECT OF MUSLINS TILL THE DANCING RECOMMENCED
I WAS NOT THINKING OF ANYTHING THAT IS ARTFUL AND DEEP TO BE SURE BUT I HAD RATHER BE TOLD AT ONCE THAT YOU WILL NOT TELL ME WELL THEN I WILL NOT THANK YOU
HOW PROPER MISTER TILNEY MIGHT BE AS A DREAMER OR A LOVER HAD NOT YET PERHAPS ENTERED MISTER ALLEN'S HEAD BUT THAT HE WAS NOT OBJECTIONABLE AS A COMMON ACQUAINTANCE FOR HIS YOUNG CHARGE
I BOUGHT ONE FOR HER THE OTHER DAY AND IT WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE A PRODIGIOUS BARGAIN BY EVERY LADY WHO SAW IT I GAVE BUT FIVE SHILLINGS A YARD FOR IT AND A TRUE INDIAN MUSLIN
CATHERINE FEARED AS SHE LISTENED TO THEIR DISCOURSE THAT HE INDULGED HIMSELF A LITTLE TOO MUCH WITH THE FOIBLES OF OTHERS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF SO EARNESTLY
YES I LIKE IT VERY WELL NOW I MUST GIVE ONE SMIRK AND THEN WE MAY BE RATIONAL AGAIN CATHERINE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD NOT KNOWING WHETHER SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO LAUGH
IF YOU PLEASE I DANCED WITH A VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN INTRODUCED BY MISTER KING HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONVERSATION WITH HIM SEEMS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY GENIUS
NEVER SIR INDEED
REPLIED MISSUS ALLEN AND SO I TOLD MISS MORLAND WHEN SHE BOUGHT IT BUT THEN YOU KNOW MADAM MUSLIN ALWAYS TURNS TO SOME ACCOUNT OR OTHER MISS MORLAND WILL GET ENOUGH OUT OF IT FOR A HANDKERCHIEF
THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES INTRODUCED TO HER A VERY GENTLEMANLIKE YOUNG MAN AS A PARTNER HIS NAME WAS TILNEY HE SEEMED TO BE ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE AND TWENTY
EVERYBODY ALLOWS THAT THE TALENT OF WRITING AGREEABLE LETTERS IS PECULIARLY FEMALE NATURE MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING BUT I AM SURE IT MUST BE ESSENTIALLY ASSISTED BY THE PRACTICE OF KEEPING A JOURNAL
SAID CATHERINE DOUBTINGLY WHETHER LADIES DO WRITE SO MUCH BETTER LETTERS THAN GENTLEMEN THAT IS I SHOULD NOT THINK THE SUPERIORITY WAS ALWAYS ON OUR SIDE
OF EVERY DAY TO BE RELATED AS THEY OUGHT TO BE UNLESS NOTED DOWN EVERY EVENING IN A JOURNAL HOW ARE YOUR VARIOUS DRESSES TO BE REMEMBERED AND THE PARTICULAR STATE OF YOUR COMPLEXION
I AM AFRAID IT HAS TORN A HOLE ALREADY I SHALL BE QUITE SORRY IF IT HAS FOR THIS IS A FAVOURITE GOWN THOUGH IT COST BUT NINE SHILLINGS A YARD THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED IT MADAM
I SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF ME SAID HE GRAVELY I SHALL MAKE BUT A POOR FIGURE IN YOUR JOURNAL TOMORROW MY JOURNAL YES I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL SAY
FOR NOW WE SHALL SOON BE ACQUAINTED AS I AM AUTHORIZED TO TEASE YOU ON THIS SUBJECT WHENEVER WE MEET AND NOTHING IN THE WORLD ADVANCES INTIMACY SO MUCH THEY DANCED AGAIN
IT IS THIS DELIGHTFUL HABIT OF JOURNALING WHICH LARGELY CONTRIBUTES TO FORM THE EASY STYLE OF WRITING FOR WHICH LADIES ARE SO GENERALLY CELEBRATED
WAS RATHER TALL HAD A PLEASING COUNTENANCE A VERY INTELLIGENT AND LIVELY EYE AND IF NOT QUITE HANDSOME WAS VERY NEAR IT HIS ADDRESS WAS GOOD
BUT WAS STRANGELY HARASSED BY A QUEER HALF WITTED MAN WHO WOULD MAKE ME DANCE WITH HIM AND DISTRESSED ME BY HIS NONSENSE INDEED I SHALL SAY NO SUCH THING
BUT I HOPE IT WAS NO MORE THAN IN A SLIGHT SLUMBER OR A MORNING DOZE AT MOST FOR IF IT BE TRUE AS A CELEBRATED WRITER HAS MAINTAINED
SAID HE AS THEY WALKED BACK TO THE BALLROOM NOT OF YOUR PARTNER I HOPE FOR BY THAT SHAKE OF THE HEAD YOUR MEDITATIONS ARE NOT SATISFACTORY CATHERINE COLOURED AND SAID
IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THE USUAL STYLE OF LETTER WRITING AMONG WOMEN IS FAULTLESS EXCEPT IN THREE PARTICULARS AND WHAT ARE THEY A GENERAL DEFICIENCY OF SUBJECT
ABOUT A WEEK SIR REPLIED CATHERINE TRYING NOT TO LAUGH REALLY WITH AFFECTED ASTONISHMENT WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED SIR
EXCELLENCE IS PRETTY FAIRLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE SEXES THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY MISSUS ALLEN
THAT NO YOUNG LADY CAN BE JUSTIFIED IN FALLING IN LOVE BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN'S LOVE IS DECLARED IT MUST BE VERY IMPROPER THAT A YOUNG LADY SHOULD DREAM OF A GENTLEMAN BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN IS FIRST KNOWN TO HAVE DREAMT OF HER
AFTER CHATTING SOME TIME ON SUCH MATTERS AS NATURALLY AROSE FROM THE OBJECTS AROUND THEM HE SUDDENLY ADDRESSED HER WITH I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN VERY REMISS MADAM
HOW CAN YOU SAID CATHERINE LAUGHING BE SO SHE HAD ALMOST SAID STRANGE
AND CURL OF YOUR HAIR TO BE DESCRIBED IN ALL THEIR DIVERSITIES WITHOUT HAVING CONSTANT RECOURSE TO A JOURNAL MY DEAR MADAM I AM NOT SO IGNORANT OF YOUNG LADIES WAYS AS YOU WISH TO BELIEVE ME
THAT ON RAISING MY HEAD AGAIN I SAW ONLY MY UNCLE AND HANS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER THE ICELANDERS HAD BEEN DISMISSED
HANS SLEPT PEACEABLY AT THE FOOT OF A ROCK IN A LAVA BED WHERE HE HAD FOUND A SUITABLE COUCH FOR HIMSELF BUT MY UNCLE WAS PACING AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE I HAD NEITHER THE WISH NOR THE STRENGTH TO RISE
SAID THE RAT AS THEY THRUST HIM INTO HIS BEDROOM
I THEN REMEMBERED THAT WE HAD SEARCHED FOR IT IN VAIN THE EVENING BEFORE MY UNCLE QUESTIONED HANS WHO AFTER HAVING EXAMINED ATTENTIVELY WITH THE EYE OF A HUNTSMAN REPLIED
THE ORDER TO HALT THEREFORE GAVE ME PLEASURE HANS LAID OUR PROVISIONS UPON A BLOCK OF LAVA AND WE ATE WITH A GOOD APPETITE BUT ONE THING TROUBLED ME OUR SUPPLY OF WATER WAS HALF CONSUMED
IN ORDER THAT ANY MAN WHO MISSED HIS FOOTING MIGHT BE HELD UP BY HIS COMPANIONS THIS SOLID FORMATION WAS PRUDENT BUT DID NOT REMOVE ALL DANGER YET NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE DESCENT DOWN STEEPS UNKNOWN TO THE GUIDE
BUT ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF JUNE THE LAST DAY BUT ONE OF THE MONTH WITH THE CHANGE OF THE MOON CAME A CHANGE OF WEATHER THE SUN POURED A FLOOD OF LIGHT DOWN THE CRATER EVERY HILLOCK
SO THAT THE GENTLE SLOPE ALLOWED ITS LOWER BRIM TO BE REACHED WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY INVOLUNTARILY I COMPARED THE WHOLE CRATER TO AN ENORMOUS ERECTED MORTAR AND THE COMPARISON PUT ME IN A TERRIBLE FRIGHT WHAT MADNESS I THOUGHT
IT STILL LINED THE WALLS WITH A THICK AND GLISTENING COAT THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WAS HERE INTENSIFIED A HUNDREDFOLD BY REFLECTION THE ONLY DIFFICULTY IN PROCEEDING LAY IN NOT SLIDING TOO FAST DOWN AN INCLINE OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE DEGREES
HANS CARRIED THE OTHER APPARATUS WHICH WAS ALSO PUT INTO ACTION THIS INGENIOUS APPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY WOULD ENABLE US TO GO ON FOR A LONG TIME BY CREATING AN ARTIFICIAL LIGHT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INFLAMMABLE GASES NOW MARCH CRIED MY UNCLE
WHAT ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WAS THE CAUSE OF THEM I COULD NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION AT THE MOMENT HUNGER AND FATIGUE MADE ME INCAPABLE OF REASONING A DESCENT OF SEVEN HOURS CONSECUTIVELY IS NOT MADE WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE EXPENDITURE OF STRENGTH I WAS EXHAUSTED
HIS HEARTY ACCENTS FALTERED AND FELL AWAY AS HE NOTICED THE STERN UNBENDING LOOK ON THE COUNTENANCES OF HIS SILENT FRIENDS AND HIS INVITATION REMAINED UNFINISHED THE BADGER STRODE UP THE STEPS TAKE HIM INSIDE HE SAID STERNLY TO HIS COMPANIONS
NOW THAT HE WAS MERELY TOAD AND NO LONGER THE TERROR OF THE HIGHWAY HE GIGGLED FEEBLY AND LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER APPEALINGLY
I DEMAND AN INSTANT EXPLANATION TAKE THEM OFF HIM THEN YOU TWO ORDERED THE BADGER BRIEFLY THEY HAD TO LAY TOAD OUT ON THE FLOOR KICKING AND CALLING ALL SORTS OF NAMES BEFORE THEY COULD GET TO WORK PROPERLY
MORE THAN THAT I AM ANXIOUS ABOUT IT WE HAVE ONLY WATER ENOUGH FOR FIVE DAYS
THIS CORD SEEMED A FRAGILE THING FOR THREE PERSONS TO BE SUSPENDED FROM I MADE AS LITTLE USE OF IT AS POSSIBLE PERFORMING WONDERFUL FEATS OF EQUILIBRIUM UPON THE LAVA PROJECTIONS WHICH MY FOOT SEEMED TO CATCH HOLD OF LIKE A HAND
SO SAYING MY UNCLE TOOK IN ONE HAND RUHMKORFF'S APPARATUS WHICH WAS HANGING FROM HIS NECK AND WITH THE OTHER HE FORMED AN ELECTRIC COMMUNICATION WITH THE COIL IN THE LANTERN AND A SUFFICIENTLY BRIGHT LIGHT DISPERSED THE DARKNESS OF THE PASSAGE
INTENDED FOR SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS HE CONSULTED HIS INSTRUMENTS AND RECORDED
IS THAT POSSIBLE YES OR FIGURES ARE OF NO USE THE PROFESSOR'S CALCULATIONS WERE QUITE CORRECT
DO CALCULATE MY BOY NOTHING IS EASIER SAID I PUTTING DOWN FIGURES IN MY NOTE BOOK NINE TIMES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET GIVES A DEPTH OF ELEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET VERY ACCURATE INDEED WELL
HOW SO I ASKED YOU WILL SEE PRESENTLY MY UNCLE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO EMPLOY MAGNIFICENT RESOURCES OBEYING ORDERS HANS TIED ALL THE NON FRAGILE ARTICLES IN ONE BUNDLE CORDED THEM FIRMLY
I'LL MAKE ONE MORE EFFORT TO BRING YOU TO REASON YOU WILL COME WITH ME INTO THE SMOKING ROOM AND THERE YOU WILL HEAR SOME FACTS ABOUT YOURSELF AND WE'LL SEE WHETHER YOU COME OUT OF THAT ROOM THE SAME TOAD THAT YOU WENT IN
RUSHED BOUNDING DOWN THE ABYSS AND IN THEIR FALL AWOKE ECHOES REMARKABLE FOR THEIR LOUD AND WELL DEFINED SHARPNESS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CONE THERE WERE GLACIERS HERE HANS ADVANCED ONLY WITH EXTREME PRECAUTION
A ROPE FASTENED TO THE EDGE OF THE APERTURE MIGHT HAVE HELPED US DOWN BUT HOW WERE WE TO UNFASTEN IT WHEN ARRIVED AT THE OTHER END MY UNCLE EMPLOYED A VERY SIMPLE EXPEDIENT TO OBVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY HE UNCOILED A CORD OF THE THICKNESS OF A FINGER
THE ORDER OF THESE VOLCANIC FORMATIONS AFFORDS THE STRONGEST CONFIRMATION TO THE THEORIES OF DAVY
HERE WE ARE AT THE TOP OF SNAEFELL AND HERE ARE TWO PEAKS
TO GO DOWN INTO A MORTAR PERHAPS A LOADED MORTAR TO BE SHOT UP INTO THE AIR AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
LEANING OVER THE EDGE OF OUR NARROW STANDING GROUND I OBSERVED THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE WAS STILL INVISIBLE THE SAME MANOEUVRE WAS REPEATED WITH THE CORD AND HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE HAD DESCENDED ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED FEET
NOW IT IS OUR TURN NOW I ASK ANY SENSIBLE MAN IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HEAR THOSE WORDS WITHOUT A SHUDDER THE PROFESSOR FASTENED HIS PACKAGE OF INSTRUMENTS UPON HIS SHOULDERS HANS TOOK THE TOOLS I TOOK THE ARMS
MY UNCLE TURNED TOO AND FOLLOWED IT AT NOON BEING AT ITS LEAST EXTENT IT CAME AND SOFTLY FELL UPON THE EDGE OF THE MIDDLE CHIMNEY THERE IT IS
MY UNCLE RECKONED UPON A FRESH SUPPLY FROM SUBTERRANEAN SOURCES BUT HITHERTO WE HAD MET WITH NONE I COULD NOT HELP DRAWING HIS ATTENTION TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE
LET US THEREFORE ASSUME THIS LAST HYPOTHESIS AS THE MOST SUITABLE TO OUR SITUATION AND CALCULATE
HE TOOK TOAD FIRMLY BY THE ARM LED HIM INTO THE SMOKING ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM THAT'S NO GOOD SAID THE RAT CONTEMPTUOUSLY
ITS DEPTH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET IMAGINE THE ASPECT OF SUCH A RESERVOIR BRIM FULL AND RUNNING OVER WITH LIQUID FIRE AMID THE ROLLING THUNDER THE BOTTOM OF THE FUNNEL WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FEET IN CIRCUIT
PORTHOS KNOCKED WITH HIS HAND A TALL PALE CLERK HIS FACE SHADED BY A FOREST OF VIRGIN HAIR OPENED THE DOOR AND BOWED WITH THE AIR OF A MAN FORCED AT ONCE TO RESPECT IN ANOTHER LOFTY STATURE WHICH INDICATED STRENGTH
TAKE MY ADVICE DON'T TOUCH THEM DEVIL TAKE ME IF I TASTE ONE OF THEM MURMURED PORTHOS TO HIMSELF AND THEN SAID ALOUD THANK YOU MY COUSIN I AM NO LONGER HUNGRY THERE WAS SILENCE PORTHOS COULD HARDLY KEEP HIS COUNTENANCE
A NOTE WHICH YOU WILL FIND AT HOME WILL TELL YOU BEGONE BEGONE AT THESE WORDS SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE CORRIDOR AND PUSHED D'ARTAGNAN OUT OF THE ROOM D'ARTAGNAN OBEYED LIKE A CHILD WITHOUT THE LEAST RESISTANCE OR OBJECTION
AH BUT THE VALISE I WANT CRIED PORTHOS IS A WELL FILLED ONE MY DEAR MADAME UTTERED FRESH SIGHS MOLIERE HAD NOT WRITTEN HIS SCENE IN L'AVARE THEN
TO THE SHAME OF THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE AND HIS OWN REGRET THAT HE DID NOT SEE THAT FIRE THAT ANIMATION THAT BUSTLE WHICH WHEN A GOOD REPAST IS ON FOOT PREVAILS GENERALLY IN THAT SANCTUARY OF GOOD LIVING
UPON THE EDGE OF WHICH FOR STILL GREATER PRECAUTION HE PLACED HIS FEET THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE TOOK PORTHOS INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM AND THEY BEGAN TO LAY THE BASIS OF A RECONCILIATION YOU CAN COME AND DINE THREE TIMES A WEEK
THE LATTER WISHED TO DETAIN HIM BY DARTING CERTAIN TENDER GLANCES BUT PORTHOS URGED THE COMMANDS OF DUTY AND THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE PLACE TO THE KING
THAT AT FIRST SIGHT ONE MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED TO HAVE SOME MEAT ON THEM PRETENDED TO SHOW THEMSELVES BUT THE CLERKS WERE NOT THE DUPES OF THIS DECEIT AND THEIR LUGUBRIOUS LOOKS SETTLED DOWN INTO RESIGNED COUNTENANCES
FREQUENTLY CAST HIS EYES WITH GREAT UNEASINESS UPON A LARGE CHEST PLACED IN FRONT OF HIS OAK DESK PORTHOS COMPREHENDED THAT THIS CHEST ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT CORRESPOND IN SHAPE WITH THAT WHICH HE HAD SEEN IN HIS DREAMS MUST BE THE BLESSED COFFER
THE CARDINAL WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE AND THE KING WAS VERY PALE THE KING MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD WITHOUT A MASK AND THE RIBBONS OF HIS DOUBLET SCARCELY TIED HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE QUEEN AND IN AN ALTERED VOICE SAID
WAS DRAWN AND THE PALE FACE OF THE CARDINAL APPEARED HE BEING DRESSED AS A SPANISH CAVALIER HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THOSE OF THE QUEEN AND A SMILE OF TERRIBLE JOY PASSED OVER HIS LIPS THE QUEEN DID NOT WEAR HER DIAMOND STUDS
THE MUSKETEER COULD NOT FORGET THE EVIL REPORTS WHICH THEN PREVAILED AND WHICH INDEED HAVE SURVIVED THEM OF THE PROCURATORS OF THE PERIOD MEANNESS STINGINESS FASTS BUT AS AFTER ALL
THE KING OPENED IT AND FOUND IN IT TWO DIAMOND STUDS WHAT DOES THIS MEAN DEMANDED HE OF THE CARDINAL NOTHING REPLIED THE LATTER ONLY IF THE QUEEN HAS THE STUDS WHICH I VERY MUCH DOUBT COUNT THEM SIRE
HE SOON DISTINGUISHED HER VOICE FROM THE OTHERS AT FIRST BY A SLIGHTLY FOREIGN ACCENT AND NEXT BY THAT TONE OF DOMINATION NATURALLY IMPRESSED UPON ALL ROYAL WORDS HE HEARD HER APPROACH AND WITHDRAW FROM THE PARTIALLY OPEN DOOR
I CAN SEND FOR THEM TO THE LOUVRE WHERE THEY ARE AND THUS YOUR MAJESTY'S WISHES WILL BE COMPLIED WITH DO SO MADAME DO SO AND THAT AT ONCE FOR WITHIN AN HOUR THE BALLET WILL COMMENCE THE QUEEN BENT IN TOKEN OF SUBMISSION
THIS IS FINE SAID PORTHOS TO HIMSELF I AM PRETTILY CAUGHT
AND TOOK FROM A BUFFET A PIECE OF CHEESE SOME PRESERVED QUINCES AND A CAKE WHICH SHE HAD HERSELF MADE OF ALMONDS AND HONEY
BUT THE KING TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE PRIVILEGE HE HAD OF LEAVING HIS LADY TO ADVANCE EAGERLY TOWARD THE QUEEN I THANK YOU MADAME SAID HE FOR THE DEFERENCE YOU HAVE SHOWN TO MY WISHES BUT I THINK YOU WANT TWO OF THE STUDS AND I BRING THEM BACK TO YOU
CUT OFF THE NECK WHICH WITH THE HEAD SHE PUT ON ONE SIDE FOR HERSELF RAISED THE WING FOR PORTHOS AND THEN RETURNED THE BIRD OTHERWISE INTACT TO THE SERVANT WHO HAD BROUGHT IT IN
A STRIPLING OF A DOZEN YEARS RISING BEHIND THE THIRD IN ALL THREE CLERKS AND A HALF WHICH FOR THE TIME ARGUED A VERY EXTENSIVE CLIENTAGE ALTHOUGH THE MUSKETEER WAS NOT EXPECTED BEFORE ONE O'CLOCK
PORTHOS LOOKED AT THE BOTTLE WHICH WAS NEAR HIM AND HOPED THAT WITH WINE BREAD AND CHEESE HE MIGHT MAKE A DINNER BUT WINE WAS WANTING THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTY
WAS PREPARED IN THE LITTLE ROOM ON THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT JEAN IN FRONT OF THE SILVER BUFFET OF THE CITY WHICH WAS GUARDED BY FOUR ARCHERS AT MIDNIGHT GREAT CRIES AND LOUD ACCLAMATIONS WERE HEARD IT WAS THE KING
THE SAME HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE QUEEN AND MADAME THE PRESIDENT THE NOBLES AND LADIES OF THEIR MAJESTIES SUITES WERE TO DRESS TWO BY TWO IN CHAMBERS PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE
IT IS MY COUSIN CRIED THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE COME IN COME IN MONSIEUR PORTHOS THE NAME OF PORTHOS PRODUCED ITS EFFECT UPON THE CLERKS WHO BEGAN TO LAUGH BUT PORTHOS TURNED SHARPLY ROUND
AT SIX IN THE EVENING THE GUESTS BEGAN TO COME AS FAST AS THEY ENTERED THEY WERE PLACED IN THE GRAND SALOON ON THE PLATFORMS PREPARED FOR THEM AT NINE O'CLOCK MADAME LA PREMIERE PRESIDENTE ARRIVED
IN WHICH THE WHOLE OF HIS SLENDER BODY WAS CONCEALED WAS BRISK AND DRY HIS LITTLE GRAY EYES SHONE LIKE CARBUNCLES AND APPEARED WITH HIS GRINNING MOUTH TO BE THE ONLY PART OF HIS FACE IN WHICH LIFE SURVIVED
AN ILL SMELLING DARK PASSAGE A STAIRCASE HALF LIGHTED BY BARS THROUGH WHICH STOLE A GLIMMER FROM A NEIGHBORING YARD ON THE FIRST FLOOR A LOW DOOR STUDDED WITH ENORMOUS NAILS
WHICH WAS ENTIRELY DARK AND LED D'ARTAGNAN INTO IT THERE SHE MADE A FRESH SIGN OF SILENCE AND OPENED A SECOND DOOR CONCEALED BY TAPESTRY THE OPENING OF THIS DOOR DISCLOSED A BRILLIANT LIGHT AND SHE DISAPPEARED
A PRIVATE ROOM HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE KING AND ANOTHER FOR MONSIEUR
OR UPON SECTIONS OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE WRONGS SO OUTRAGEOUS AS TO JUSTIFY EVEN THE MOST PEACEFUL PERSONS IN GOING TO WAR THERE ARE ALSO WEAK NATIONS SO UTTERLY INCOMPETENT
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASSACRED FOR IF THE JEWS IN RUSSIA AND THE ARMENIANS IN TURKEY HAD BEEN ARMED AND HAD BEEN EFFICIENT IN THE USE OF THEIR ARMS NO MOB WOULD HAVE MEDDLED WITH THEM
I KISSED HER SHOES AND THE ANKLES ABOVE HER SHOES WHEN THE HEM OF HER GARMENT TOUCHED MY FACE I TREMBLED WHEN AFTER TWO YEARS OF THAT LIFE
I WAS TREMBLING ALL OVER I HATED THE MEN I THOUGHT HAD WRONGED HER I WAS SICK OF LIVING ALONE AND WANTED HER BACK THE LONGER I WAITED THE MORE RAW AND TENDER I BECAME I THOUGHT THAT IF SHE CAME IN AND JUST
LATE IN APRIL CAME THE PLANTING IN THE LITTLE PATHS AMONG THE SEED BEDS SHE STOOD HOLDING A PAPER BAG IN HER HAND THE BAG WAS FILLED WITH SEEDS A FEW AT A TIME SHE HANDED ME THE SEEDS
AS MATTERS BETWEEN PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE DECIDED DURING THE LAST CENTURY AT LEAST HALF OF THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUGHT HAVE BEEN CIVIL AND NOT FOREIGN WARS THERE ARE BIG AND POWERFUL NATIONS WHICH HABITUALLY COMMIT EITHER UPON OTHER NATIONS
WASH WILLIAMS HAD BEEN CALLED THE BEST TELEGRAPH OPERATOR IN THE STATE AND IN SPITE OF HIS DEGRADEMENT TO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG HE WAS STILL PROUD OF HIS ABILITY
I SAT IN THE PARLOR OF THAT HOUSE TWO HOURS HER MOTHER TOOK ME IN THERE AND LEFT ME THEIR HOUSE WAS STYLISH THEY WERE WHAT IS CALLED RESPECTABLE PEOPLE THERE WERE PLUSH CHAIRS AND A COUCH IN THE ROOM
WHEN WASH WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS SUCH A ONE HAD AN INSTINCT TO PAY HIM HOMAGE TO RAISE HIS HAT OR TO BOW BEFORE HIM THE SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAD SUPERVISION OVER THE TELEGRAPH OPERATORS
UNDER THE MAHDI FOR A DOZEN YEARS AND DURING THOSE DOZEN YEARS THE BIGOTRY TYRANNY AND CRUEL RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WERE SUCH AS FLOURISHED IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY AND IN SPITE OF SYSTEMATIC SLAVE RAIDS
WHO ARE READY ENOUGH TO PRAISE WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST AND YET ARE INCAPABLE OF PROFITING BY IT WHEN FACED BY THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT DURING OUR GENERATION THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PECULIARLY THE CASE AMONG THE MEN
IN THE COMPLETENESS OF HIS UGLINESS HE ACHIEVED A KIND OF PERVERTED BEAUTY CHILDREN STOPPING BEFORE THE CAGE ARE FASCINATED MEN TURN AWAY WITH AN AIR OF DISGUST AND WOMEN LINGER FOR A MOMENT
IT IS THE FOOLISH PEACE AT ANY PRICE PERSONS WHO TRY TO PERSUADE OUR PEOPLE TO MAKE UNWISE AND IMPROPER TREATIES OR TO STOP BUILDING UP THE NAVY BUT IF TROUBLE COMES AND THE TREATIES ARE REPUDIATED
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MEN A LITTLE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WOMEN THEY ARE SENT TO PREVENT MEN MAKING THE WORLD WORTH WHILE IT IS A TRICK IN NATURE UGH THEY ARE CREEPING CRAWLING SQUIRMING THINGS
SOMETHING HE SAW LURKING IN THE STARING EYES TOLD HIM THAT THE MAN WHO HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO OTHERS HAD NEVERTHELESS SOMETHING TO SAY TO HIM
AND SAT ON A PILE OF DECAYING RAILROAD TIES BESIDE THE TRACKS IT WAS THEN THAT THE OPERATOR TOLD THE YOUNG REPORTER HIS STORY OF HATE PERHAPS A DOZEN TIMES
HE WAITED EXPECTANTLY WHEN THE OPERATOR REMAINED SILENT AND SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT TALKING HE TRIED TO MAKE CONVERSATION WERE YOU EVER MARRIED MISTER WILLIAMS HE BEGAN
THERE WAS SOMETHING ALMOST BEAUTIFUL IN THE VOICE OF WASH WILLIAMS THE HIDEOUS TELLING HIS STORY OF HATE THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR OF WINESBURG SITTING IN THE DARKNESS ON THE RAILROAD TIES HAD BECOME A POET
TO THEIR COUNTRY AND TO MANKIND THAN THOSE WHO EXALT UNRIGHTEOUS PEACE AS BETTER THAN RIGHTEOUS WAR THE MEN WHO HAVE STOOD HIGHEST IN OUR HISTORY AS IN THE HISTORY OF ALL COUNTRIES ARE THOSE WHO SCORNED INJUSTICE
IF THEY AFFECTED ONLY THEMSELVES MANY OF THEM ARE IN THE ORDINARY RELATIONS OF LIFE GOOD CITIZENS THEY ARE EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER GOOD CITIZENS WHO BELIEVE THAT ENFORCED UNIVERSAL VEGETARIANISM OR ANTI VACCINATION
HE COMMANDED MY WIFE SHE IS DEAD YES SURELY I TELL YOU ALL WOMEN ARE DEAD MY MOTHER YOUR MOTHER
WITH HIGH IDEALISM TEMPERED BY SANE FACING OF THE ACTUAL FACTS OF LIFE HAVE STRIVEN TO BRING NEARER THE DAY WHEN ARMED STRIFE BETWEEN NATION AND NATION BETWEEN CLASS AND CLASS
IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THEY SHOULD HAVE PEACEFULLY SUBMITTED TO SEEING THEIR COUNTRY SPLIT INTO HALF A DOZEN JANGLING CONFEDERACIES AND SLAVERY MADE PERPETUAL IF UNWILLING TO LEARN FROM THEIR OWN HISTORY
AROSE FROM THE PILE OF RAILROAD TIES AND WALKED ALONG THE TRACKS TOWARD TOWN THE OPERATOR FINISHED HIS TALE QUICKLY BREATHLESSLY HER MOTHER SENT FOR ME HE SAID
AS YET IN NEITHER CASE IS THERE ANY EFFICIENT METHOD OF GETTING INTERNATIONAL ACTION AND IF JOINT ACTION BY SEVERAL POWERS IS SECURED THE RESULT IS USUALLY CONSIDERABLY WORSE THAN IF ONLY ONE POWER INTERFERED
RUSSIA GERMANY ENGLAND AND FRANCE IN POSSESSION OF FRAGMENTS OF HER EMPIRE AND HAS TWICE WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE PRESENT GENERATION SEEN HER CAPITAL IN THE HANDS OF ALLIED INVADERS BECAUSE SHE IN VERY FACT
ONLY WHEN THE SUDAN LOST ITS INDEPENDENCE AND PASSED UNDER ENGLISH RULE YET THIS WELL MEANING LITTLE SONNETEER SINCERELY FELT THAT HIS VERSES WERE ISSUED IN THE CAUSE OF HUMANITY
HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
IN ORDER THAT A MARQUIS MIGHT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER OR TO HAVE INSISTED THAT SINCE A FAIR MAIDEN WAS TO BE SOUGHT SHE SHOULD KEEP HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY MISTER GASCOIGNE'S CALCULATIONS WERE OF THE KIND CALLED RATIONAL
AND WHAT REMAINED OF ALL THINGS KNOWABLE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THROUGH NOVELS PLAYS AND POEMS ABOUT HER FRENCH AND MUSIC THE TWO JUSTIFYING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A YOUNG LADY SHE FELT NO GROUND FOR UNEASINESS
FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
AND HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING A TOO FRISKY HORSE IN ORDER THAT GWENDOLEN MIGHT BE THREATENED WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BE RESCUED BY A MAN OF PROPERTY HE WISHED HIS NIECE WELL AND HE MEANT HER TO BE SEEN TO ADVANTAGE IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
IT WAS ALWAYS SHE HERSELF WHO HAD TO BE TOLERANT TO BEG THAT ALICE WHO SAT WAITING ON HER WOULD NOT STICK UP HER SHOULDERS IN THAT FRIGHTFUL MANNER AND THAT ISABEL INSTEAD OF PUSHING UP TO HER AND ASKING QUESTIONS WOULD GO AWAY TO MISS MERRY
THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
BUT HER THOUGHTS NEVER DWELT ON MARRIAGE AS THE FULFILLMENT OF HER AMBITION THE DRAMAS IN WHICH SHE IMAGINED HERSELF A HEROINE WERE NOT WROUGHT UP TO THAT CLOSE TO BE VERY MUCH SUED OR HOPELESSLY SIGHED FOR AS A BRIDE WAS INDEED
AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
WHAT WILL GWENDOLEN THINK IF THE FOOTMAN TROD HEAVILY IN CREAKING BOOTS OR IF THE LAUNDRESS'S WORK WAS UNSATISFACTORY THE MAID SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO FOR MISS HARLETH
HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
WHOSE FIRMNESS SHOWED ITSELF IN NO VERY GRACEFUL OR EUPHONIOUS WAY AND WHO WERE NOT ELDEST DAUGHTERS WITH A TENDER TIMID MOTHER COMPUNCTIOUS AT HAVING SUBJECTED THEM TO INCONVENIENCES
WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
YOU WILL HEREAFTER FIND YOUR OWN HOUSE AS FAULTLESS AS YOU NOW DO THIS THERE CERTAINLY ARE CIRCUMSTANCES SAID WILLOUGHBY
OR VARIETY OF SPECULATION HER WONDER WAS OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IT WAS ENGROSSED BY THE EXTRAORDINARY SILENCE OF HER SISTER AND WILLOUGHBY ON THE SUBJECT WHICH THEY MUST KNOW TO BE PECULIARLY INTERESTING TO THEM ALL AS THIS SILENCE CONTINUED
I AM HEARTILY GLAD OF IT HE CRIED MAY SHE ALWAYS BE POOR IF SHE CAN EMPLOY HER RICHES NO BETTER THANK YOU WILLOUGHBY BUT YOU MAY BE ASSURED THAT I WOULD NOT SACRIFICE ONE SENTIMENT OF LOCAL ATTACHMENT OF YOURS OR OF ANY ONE WHOM I LOVED
AN ELEMENT FATAL TO MAN THEY SAY BUT VITAL TO MYRIADS OF ANIMALS AND TO ME
THE NAUTILUS WAS MOTIONLESS ITS BALLAST TANKS FULL IT WAS SITTING AT A DEPTH OF ONE THOUSAND METERS IN A COMPARATIVELY UNPOPULATED REGION OF THE OCEAN WHERE ONLY LARGER FISH PUT IN OCCASIONAL APPEARANCES JUST THEN I WAS STUDYING A DELIGHTFUL BOOK
SEE HE WENT ON IT'S WAKING UP UNDER THE SUN'S CARESSES IT'S GOING TO RELIVE ITS DAILY EXISTENCE WHAT A FASCINATING FIELD OF STUDY LIES IN WATCHING THE PLAY OF ITS ORGANISM IT OWNS A PULSE AND ARTERIES IT HAS SPASMS AND I SIDE WITH THE SCHOLARLY
IT WAS A FINE CATCH BUT NOT SURPRISING IN ESSENCE THESE NETS STAYED IN OUR WAKE FOR SEVERAL HOURS INCARCERATING AN ENTIRE AQUATIC WORLD IN PRISONS MADE OF THREAD SO WE WERE NEVER LACKING IN PROVISIONS OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY
OR THAT THEY MEANT THERE'S NOTHING IN SIGHT AND IN TRUTH THE OCEAN WAS DESERTED NOT A SAIL ON THE HORIZON THE TIPS OF CRESPO ISLAND HAD DISAPPEARED DURING THE NIGHT THE SEA ABSORBING EVERY COLOR OF THE PRISM EXCEPT ITS BLUE RAYS
CONSEIL AND LAND SPENT THE LONG HOURS WITH ME CONSEIL HAD TOLD HIS FRIEND ABOUT THE WONDERS OF OUR UNDERSEA STROLL AND THE CANADIAN WAS SORRY HE HADN'T GONE ALONG BUT I HOPED AN OPPORTUNITY WOULD ARISE FOR A VISIT TO THE FORESTS OF OCEANIA
MADE A SPECIAL STUDY OF THEM AND THESE ANIMALS FURNISHED MANY RIBALD
HAS ONLY TO INCREASE ITS HEAT SALT AND MICROSCOPIC ANIMAL LIFE IN ESSENCE HEAT CREATES THE DIFFERENT DENSITIES THAT LEAD TO CURRENTS AND COUNTERCURRENTS EVAPORATION
AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED METERS WAS FOUND IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METERS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN THE MOST REMARKABLE SOUNDINGS WERE TAKEN IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC NEAR THE THIRTY FIFTH PARALLEL AND THEY GAVE TWELVE THOUSAND METERS
ALMOST EVERY DAY THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE WERE OPEN FOR SOME HOURS AND OUR EYES NEVER TIRED OF PROBING THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNDERWATER WORLD THE NAUTILUS'S GENERAL HEADING WAS SOUTHEAST
CAN ACCOUNT FOR MUST IT NOT HAVE BEEN SO MARIANNE SPEAKING TO HER IN A LOWERED VOICE THEN CONTINUING HIS FORMER TONE HE SAID AND YET THIS HOUSE YOU WOULD SPOIL MISSUS DASHWOOD
AND BUILD IT UP AGAIN IN THE EXACT PLAN OF THIS COTTAGE WITH DARK NARROW STAIRS AND A KITCHEN THAT SMOKES I SUPPOSE SAID ELINOR YES CRIED HE IN THE SAME EAGER TONE WITH ALL AND EVERY THING BELONGING TO IT
REACHING STRATA LOCATED TWO THOUSAND METERS UNDERWATER THE THERMOMETER INDICATED A TEMPERATURE OF FOUR POINT TWO FIVE DEGREES CENTIGRADE WHICH AT THIS DEPTH SEEMED TO BE A TEMPERATURE COMMON TO ALL LATITUDES
THE PROPELLER WAS INSTANTLY SET IN MOTION AND THE LOG GAVE OUR SPEED AS TWENTY MILES PER HOUR OVER THE ENSUING DAYS AND WEEKS CAPTAIN NEMO WAS VERY FRUGAL WITH HIS VISITS I SAW HIM ONLY AT RARE INTERVALS
WHICH THE WATER HADN'T YET DECOMPOSED WITH A SUPREME EFFORT SHE HAD LIFTED HER CHILD ABOVE HER HEAD AND THE POOR LITTLE CREATURE'S ARMS WERE STILL TWINED AROUND ITS MOTHER'S NECK THE POSTURES OF THE FOUR SEAMEN SEEMED GHASTLY TO ME TWISTED FROM CONVULSIVE MOVEMENTS
WITH A FIXED DETERMINATION THAT HE SHOULD NOT ESCAPE THEM ALL SOMETHING VERY MELANCHOLY MUST BE THE MATTER I AM SURE SAID SHE I COULD SEE IT IN HIS FACE
IN THE MIDST OF THE LIQUID ELEMENT BUT ALSO TO PROBE THE OCEAN'S MOST DAUNTING MYSTERIES DURING THE DAY OF DECEMBER ELEVENTH I WAS BUSY READING IN THE MAIN LOUNGE NED LAND AND CONSEIL WERE OBSERVING THE LUMINOUS WATERS THROUGH THE GAPING PANELS
A SORRY SIGHT THIS CARCASS LOST UNDER THE WAVES
MISSUS DASHWOOD AGAIN ASSURED HIM THAT NO ALTERATION OF THE KIND SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED YOU ARE A GOOD WOMAN HE WARMLY REPLIED YOUR PROMISE MAKES ME EASY EXTEND IT A LITTLE FARTHER AND IT WILL MAKE ME HAPPY
AND EVERY BODY WOULD BE EAGER TO PASS THROUGH THE ROOM WHICH HAS HITHERTO CONTAINED WITHIN ITSELF MORE REAL ACCOMMODATION AND COMFORT THAN ANY OTHER APARTMENT OF THE HANDSOMEST DIMENSIONS IN THE WORLD COULD POSSIBLY AFFORD
DO YOU KNOW THE DEPTH OF THE OCEAN FLOOR AT LEAST CAPTAIN I KNOW WHAT THE MAJOR SOUNDINGS TELL US COULD YOU QUOTE THEM TO ME SO I CAN DOUBLE CHECK THEM AS THE NEED ARISES HERE I REPLIED ARE A FEW OF THEM THAT STICK IN MY MEMORY IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
NED LAND WAS NOT MISTAKEN WE WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A SHIP WHOSE SEVERED SHROUDS STILL HUNG FROM THEIR CLASPS ITS HULL LOOKED IN GOOD CONDITION
SHE COULD NOT ACCOUNT AND IT WAS SO WHOLLY CONTRADICTORY TO THEIR GENERAL OPINIONS AND PRACTICE THAT A DOUBT SOMETIMES ENTERED HER MIND OF THEIR BEING REALLY ENGAGED AND THIS DOUBT WAS ENOUGH TO PREVENT HER MAKING ANY INQUIRY OF MARIANNE
DOESN'T IT EXPERIENCE BOTH ANGER AND AFFECTION LAST EVENING IT WENT TO SLEEP JUST AS WE DID AND THERE IT IS WAKING UP AFTER A PEACEFUL NIGHT NO HELLOS OR GOOD MORNINGS FOR THIS GENT YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS ECCENTRIC INDIVIDUAL WAS SIMPLY CONTINUING A CONVERSATION WE'D ALREADY STARTED
THAT THE NAUTILUS ENCOUNTERED THIS ARMY OF DISTINCTLY NOCTURNAL MOLLUSKS THEY NUMBERED IN THE MILLIONS THEY WERE MIGRATING FROM THE TEMPERATE ZONES TOWARD ZONES STILL WARMER FOLLOWING THE ITINERARIES OF HERRING AND SARDINES WE STARED AT THEM THROUGH OUR THICK GLASS WINDOWS
ON NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTH AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE NAUTILUS CLEARED THE TROPIC OF CANCER AT LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO DEGREES ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT PASSED IN SIGHT OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS WHERE THE FAMOUS CAPTAIN COOK MET HIS DEATH
HIS CHIEF OFFICER REGULARLY FIXED THE POSITIONS I FOUND REPORTED ON THE CHART
DECKED OUT IN THE COLORS BLUE AND SILVER AND THREE MAGNIFICENT TUNA WHOSE HIGH SPEEDS COULDN'T SAVE THEM FROM OUR TRAWL
FOR WHAT ELSE CAN IT BE I WONDER WHETHER IT IS SO I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO KNOW THE TRUTH OF IT PERHAPS IT IS ABOUT MISS WILLIAMS AND BY THE BYE I DARE SAY IT IS BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO CONSCIOUS WHEN I MENTIONED HER
THE TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD THE PONDERATION OF AIR THE FIXATION OF MERCURY SUCCEEDED TO THAT PLACE IN THE PUBLIC MIND WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY OCCUPIED BY THE CONTROVERSIES OF THE ROTA
AND THOUGH NO PAPIST LIKED A PAPIST MUCH BETTER THAN A PURITAN IT WOULD BE UNJUST TO DENY THAT CHARLES HAD SOME OF THE QUALITIES OF A GOOD AND EVEN OF A GREAT PRINCE HE WROTE AND SPOKE NOT LIKE HIS FATHER
HAD AT LENGTH PRODUCED AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE CAVALIERS AND THE PRESBYTERIANS SOME PRESBYTERIANS HAD INDEED BEEN DISPOSED TO SUCH AN ALLIANCE EVEN BEFORE THE DEATH OF CHARLES THE FIRST BUT IT WAS
ONE AFTER ANOTHER PHANTOMS WHICH HAD HAUNTED THE WORLD THROUGH AGES OF DARKNESS FLED BEFORE THE LIGHT ASTROLOGY AND ALCHYMY BECAME JESTS SOON THERE WAS SCARCELY A COUNTY IN WHICH SOME OF THE QUORUM DID NOT SMILE CONTEMPTUOUSLY
AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE CROWN TO DEPRIVE THE COURTS OF LAW OF ALL INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY
ALL CLASSES WERE HURRIED ALONG BY THE PREVAILING SENTIMENT
TOUCH THEM NOT SAID DEATH
IT WAS SO PALE THE SMALL EYES HAD CLOSED THEMSELVES AND IT DREW ITS BREATH SO SOFTLY NOW AND THEN WITH A DEEP RESPIRATION AS IF IT SIGHED AND THE MOTHER LOOKED STILL MORE SORROWFULLY ON THE LITTLE CREATURE
TAKEN THE SIDE OF PUBLIC LIBERTY TO SIT IN THE UPPER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT WITHOUT ANY NEW CREATION THUS FAR THE STATESMEN BY WHOSE ADVICE RICHARD ACTED HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL
HAST SUNG FOR THY CHILD I AM FOND OF THEM I HAVE HEARD THEM BEFORE I AM NIGHT I SAW THY TEARS WHILST THOU SANG'ST THEM
AND SHE LOOKED DOWN INTO THE WELL
FOR THE DREAD OF THAT INVINCIBLE ARMY WAS ON ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE ISLAND AND THE CAVALIERS TAUGHT BY A HUNDRED DISASTROUS FIELDS HOW LITTLE NUMBERS CAN EFFECT AGAINST DISCIPLINE
THERE COULD BE NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF MUTUAL CONTRACT
THAT PARTY HAD ALWAYS BEEN DESIROUS TO SEE THE OLD CIVIL POLITY
BUT DO NOT STOP ME NOW I MAY OVERTAKE HIM I MAY FIND MY CHILD BUT NIGHT STOOD STILL AND MUTE THEN THE MOTHER WRUNG HER HANDS
WAS SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE SHOULD NEVER HAVE REPROACHED HIM WITH THIS GREAT VICE
THE REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT CEASING TO OPERATE IN POLITICS BEGAN TO EXERT ITSELF WITH UNPRECEDENTED VIGOUR AND HARDIHOOD IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS
BUT DARING AND INGENIOUS MEN MIGHT INDEMNIFY THEMSELVES BY TREATING WITH DISDAIN WHAT HAD LATELY BEEN CONSIDERED AS THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF NATURE THE TORRENT WHICH HAD BEEN DAMMED UP IN ONE CHANNEL RUSHED VIOLENTLY INTO ANOTHER
AND GOT THE OLD WOMAN'S SNOW WHITE HAIR INSTEAD SO THEY WENT INTO DEATH'S GREAT GREENHOUSE WHERE FLOWERS AND TREES GREW STRANGELY INTO ONE ANOTHER THERE STOOD FINE HYACINTHS UNDER GLASS BELLS AND THERE STOOD
IT SEEMED THAT THE INDEPENDENTS WERE TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE PRESBYTERIANS AND THAT THE MEN OF THE SWORD WERE TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE MEN OF THE GOWN A COALITION
AND FELT TOWARDS THOSE WHOM HE HAD DESERTED THAT PECULIAR MALIGNITY WHICH HAS IN ALL AGES BEEN CHARACTERISTIC OF APOSTATES
AS OFTEN AS THE TRUNCHEON WAS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FEEBLE HAND TO ANOTHER
DOCTRINE THE CIVIL TROUBLES HAD STIMULATED THE FACULTIES OF THE EDUCATED CLASSES AND HAD CALLED FORTH A RESTLESS ACTIVITY AND AN INSATIABLE CURIOSITY SUCH AS HAD NOT BEFORE BEEN KNOWN AMONG US
WHERE SHALL I FIND MY LITTLE CHILD NAY I KNOW NOT SAID THE WOMAN
THE OLD MAN SAT AND ROCKED THE CRADLE
AND THE WIND BLEW SO THAT IT CUT THE FACE AS THE OLD MAN TREMBLED WITH COLD AND THE LITTLE CHILD SLEPT A MOMENT
HIS CHOICE WAS SOON MADE HE DISSOLVED HIS FIRST PARLIAMENT AND LEVIED TAXES BY HIS OWN AUTHORITY HE CONVOKED A SECOND PARLIAMENT AND FOUND IT MORE INTRACTABLE THAN THE FIRST
AND PUZZLED PHILOSOPHERS CHARLES HIMSELF HAD A LABORATORY AT WHITEHALL AND WAS FAR MORE ACTIVE AND ATTENTIVE
TO MAKE CHARLES A MONARCH AS ABSOLUTE AS ANY ON THE CONTINENT
SAID THE WEEPING MOTHER AND SHE WEPT STILL MORE
SUBSTITUTED FOR THE ANCIENT JURISPRUDENCE OF THE REALM THE KING CALLED A THIRD PARLIAMENT AND SOON PERCEIVED THAT THE OPPOSITION WAS STRONGER AND FIERCER THAN EVER
THE GREAT LEADEN WEIGHT RAN DOWN TO THE FLOOR BUMP AND THEN THE CLOCK ALSO STOOD STILL BUT THE POOR MOTHER RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND CRIED ALOUD FOR HER CHILD
STRONG STEMMED PEONIES THERE GREW WATER PLANTS SOME SO FRESH OTHERS HALF SICK
REPORT TO HIM THAT NOT A SINGLE DISSENTER WAS TO BE FOUND
IT WAS THEN THAT RAY MADE A NEW CLASSIFICATION OF BIRDS AND FISHES AND THAT THE ATTENTION OF WOODWARD WAS FIRST DRAWN TOWARDS FOSSILS AND SHELLS
OUT THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE SNOW THERE SAT A WOMAN IN LONG BLACK CLOTHES AND SHE SAID DEATH HAS BEEN IN THY CHAMBER AND I SAW HIM HASTEN AWAY WITH THY LITTLE CHILD
BUT THE OLD MAN WAS GONE AND HER LITTLE CHILD WAS GONE HE HAD TAKEN IT WITH HIM AND THE OLD CLOCK IN THE
ON THE TROOPS IF THE PRESBYTERIANS OBSTINATELY STOOD ALOOF FROM THE ROYALISTS THE STATE WAS LOST AND MEN MIGHT WELL DOUBT WHETHER BY THE COMBINED EXERTIONS OF PRESBYTERIANS AND ROYALISTS IT COULD BE SAVED
IT WAS PROBABLE THAT CHARLES THE SECOND WOULD TAKE WARNING BY THE FATE OF CHARLES THE FIRST BUT BE THIS AS IT MIGHT THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED THE COUNTRY
AND BY CHEERFUL RESIGNATION UNDER CRUEL WRONGS AND MISFORTUNES BUT THE CANT THEN
CRIED THE DWARF ANGRILY BUT HERE ARE THE LIONS COMING THEY'LL EAT YOU UP IN THREE MOUTHFULS AND THERE WILL BE AN END OF YOU AND YOUR PRIDE AND INDEED AT THAT MOMENT THE POOR PRINCESS HEARD THEIR DREADFUL HOWLS COMING NEARER
DO LEAVE ME IN PEACE MADAM I DON'T WANT TO CARE FOR ANYONE BUT YOU WOULD BE VERY HAPPY WITH ANY OF THESE PRINCES SAID THE QUEEN
WITHOUT THE YELLOW DWARF AND HIS ORANGE TREE
SEEING THAT I HAVE LOST THE BASKET OF CAKE
THIS IS ONE THAT SHE LIKED VERY MUCH
AND THAT NEITHER OF THESE WAS THE REAL REASON OF THE QUEEN'S UNEASINESS SO SHE MADE UP HER MIND THAT SHE WOULD GO AND CONSULT THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT ABOUT IT ESPECIALLY AS SHE HAD OFTEN HEARD HOW WISE SHE WAS
BEHIND THEM CAME A TALL OLD WOMAN WHOSE UGLINESS WAS EVEN MORE SURPRISING THAN HER EXTREME OLD AGE SHE WORE A RUFF OF BLACK TAFFETA A RED VELVET HOOD AND A FARTHINGALE ALL IN RAGS
THE UNHAPPY QUEEN SEEING ALL AT ONCE WHAT A MISERABLE LIFE HER DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE WITH THIS DWARF COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA AND FELL DOWN INSENSIBLE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD WHEN SHE REVIVED
WHICH WERE GIVEN AWAY TO EVERYONE WHO LIKED TO HOLD OUT HIS HAND WHICH NUMBERS OF PEOPLE HASTENED TO DO YOU MAY BE SURE INDEED SOME FOUND THIS BY FAR THE MOST AMUSING PART OF THE WEDDING FESTIVITIES
THIS CHANCE MEETING WITH AN UNHAPPY PRINCESS FOR WHOM I ONCE HAD A PASSING FANCY BEFORE I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MEET YOU HAS AFFECTED ME A LITTLE I ADMIT BUT YOU ARE SO MUCH MORE TO ME THAN SHE IS THAT I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN LEAVE YOU
HER MOTHER WHO SINCE THE DEATH OF THE KING HER FATHER HAD NOTHING IN THE WORLD SHE CARED FOR SO MUCH AS THIS LITTLE PRINCESS WAS SO TERRIBLY AFRAID OF LOSING HER THAT SHE QUITE SPOILED HER
AND AS MANY ELEGIES MADRIGALS AND SONGS WHICH WERE SENT HER BY ALL THE POETS IN THE WORLD
BUT THE QUEEN WHO DIDN'T WANT HER TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ONLY SAID THAT SHE WAS ILL OR THAT ONE OF HER NEIGHBORS WAS THREATENING TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HER BELLISSIMA KNEW QUITE WELL THAT SOMETHING WAS BEING HIDDEN FROM HER
GREW UP SO PROUD AND SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER OWN BEAUTY THAT SHE DESPISED EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD THE QUEEN HER MOTHER BY HER CARESSES AND FLATTERIES HELPED TO MAKE HER BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO GOOD FOR HER
AND FOR EVER MISERABLE CREATURE LEST I TAKE YOUR LIFE AND SO RID MYSELF OF YOUR MALICE HE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN THESE WORDS WHEN THE LID OF THE BOX FELL BACK ON THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIBLE NOISE
AND MANY LITTLE BROOKS MURMURED SOFTLY UNDER THE SHADY TREES WHERE IT WAS ALWAYS COOL AND FRESH A LITTLE WAY OFF STOOD A SPLENDID PALACE THE WALLS OF WHICH WERE OF TRANSPARENT EMERALDS
WAS FEELING TERRIBLY SAD AT BEING SO RAPIDLY TORN AWAY FROM HIS BELOVED PRINCESS BUT HE KNEW TOO WELL HOW POWERFUL THE FAIRY WAS TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING FROM HER EXCEPT BY GREAT PATIENCE AND CUNNING
SAVE ME THIS MINUTE OR I SHALL DIE OF TERROR INDEED AS SHE SPOKE SHE FELL DOWN INSENSIBLE
HE SAW HIS BELOVED PRINCESS IN A CASTLE BUILT OF POLISHED STEEL THE WALLS OF WHICH REFLECTED THE SUN'S RAYS SO HOTLY THAT NO ONE COULD APPROACH IT WITHOUT BEING BURNT TO A CINDER
AND WERE BRIGHT RED AT THIS DREADFUL SIGHT THE POOR QUEEN WHO WAS TREMBLING LIKE A DOVE WHEN IT SEES A HAWK CRIED OUT AS LOUD AS SHE COULD
IS IT YOU DEAR PRINCE WHAT MISFORTUNE HAS BROUGHT YOU TO THIS DISMAL PLACE THE KING WHO WAS QUITE DECEIVED BY HER ALTERED APPEARANCE REPLIED ALAS BEAUTIFUL FAIRY THE FAIRY WHO BROUGHT ME HERE FIRST TOOK AWAY MY SIGHT
IF YOU HAD NOT NOTICED HOW MUCH I PITIED THESE PRINCES WHO WERE LEAVING ME FOR EVER BUT FOR YOU SIRE IT IS VERY DIFFERENT YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE PLEASED WITH ME
WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW ALL THESE THINGS AND REMEMBERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE TOO FELL INTO THE DEEPEST SADNESS
AND HER MOTHER WHO WAS GETTING REALLY ANGRY AT HER DETERMINATION NOT TO BE MARRIED BEGAN TO WISH THAT SHE HAD NOT ALLOWED HER TO HAVE HER OWN WAY SO MUCH AT LAST NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO DO
WHO WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE HE WAS A DWARF AND HAD SUCH A YELLOW FACE AND LIVED IN THE ORANGE TREE I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT FOR I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A WIFE ALL OVER THE WORLD NOW IF YOU WILL PROMISE THAT SHE SHALL MARRY ME
SO LITTLE DID SHE CARE YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW HARD HEARTED HER LOVERS THOUGHT HER AND THE QUEEN WHO WISHED TO SEE HER MARRIED DID NOT KNOW HOW TO PERSUADE HER TO THINK OF IT SERIOUSLY BELLISSIMA SHE SAID I
AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY ALREADY YOU SEE IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO DO IF YOU REALLY CARE FOR ME
AND SAW IT COVERED WITH FLOWERS AND FRUIT SHE STOPPED AND BEGAN TO GATHER SOME OF THE ORANGES AND THEN PUTTING DOWN HER BASKET SHE SAT DOWN TO EAT THEM BUT WHEN IT WAS TIME TO GO ON AGAIN THE BASKET HAD DISAPPEARED AND THOUGH SHE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
AND BEGGED HER TO FORGIVE HIM AT LAST THE HAPPY DAY CAME EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR BELLISSIMA'S WEDDING THE TRUMPETS SOUNDED
AND IT WAS SO DARK THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY SEE AT ALL THE THUNDER CRASHED AND THE LIGHTNING SEEMED AS IF IT MUST BURN UP EVERYTHING THE TWO BASILISKS APPEARED
DO YOU REALLY MEAN WHAT YOU SAY PRINCE SAID THE FAIRY QUITE DECEIVED SURELY REPLIED THE PRINCE HOW COULD I DECEIVE YOU YOU SEE IT IS SO MUCH MORE FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BE LOVED BY A FAIRY THAN BY A SIMPLE PRINCESS
ARE LIABLE TO LIVE FOR MANY YEARS MY LIFE IS NECESSARILY SHORT SO I MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FEW DAYS THAT REMAIN TO ME THERE THERE DON'T WORRY ANSWERED THE SCARECROW SOOTHINGLY
THE MOST STUPID OF THE ENTIRE PARTY YOU MAKE ME QUITE ASHAMED OF MYSELF SAID THE SCARECROW BOWING LOW TO THE SAW HORSE NEVERTHELESS THE CREATURE IS RIGHT DECLARED THE WOGGLE BUG
BUT OUR FRIEND THE WOGGLE BUG CLAIMS TO BE HIGHLY EDUCATED SO HE OUGHT EASILY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT CAN BE DONE IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF EDUCATION
AND THE ENGRAVED OIL CAN I BEGIN TO THINK
OBJECTED TIP NO BUT HE MAY BE INDUCED TO CARRY THREE SAID HIS MAJESTY I SHALL THEREFORE LEAVE MY ROYAL ARMY BEHIND FOR FROM THE EASE WITH WHICH HE WAS CONQUERED
SAID HE I HAVE CAPTURED A WOGGLE BUG A VERY RARE AND INTERESTING SPECIMEN DO ANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT A WOGGLE BUG IS NO YELLED THE SCHOLARS IN CHORUS THEN SAID THE PROFESSOR
THEY COULD USE YOU FOR SEED THE SOLDIER NOW RETURNED WITH A LONG LINE AND TIED ALL THREE FIRMLY TOGETHER ALSO LASHING THEM TO THE BODY OF THE SAW HORSE SO THERE SEEMED LITTLE DANGER OF THEIR TUMBLING OFF NOW THROW OPEN THE GATES COMMANDED THE SCARECROW
AND WE WILL MAKE A DASH TO LIBERTY OR TO DEATH THE COURTYARD IN WHICH THEY WERE STANDING WAS LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PALACE WHICH SURROUNDED IT ON ALL SIDES BUT IN ONE PLACE A PASSAGE LED TO AN OUTER GATEWAY
ASKED THE WOGGLE BUG LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WITH UNCONCEALED INTEREST NOT MORE SO THAN YOURSELF ANSWERED THE SCARECROW EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS UNUSUAL UNTIL YOU GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT WHAT RARE PHILOSOPHY
THEN I AM REALLY IN DANGER DECLARED HIS MAJESTY POSITIVELY AND IT WILL BE WISE FOR ME TO CONSIDER A MEANS TO ESCAPE
THEN BRIGHT AND EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THEY SET OUT UPON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO THE EMERALD CITY
I'M SURE THE EMPEROR WILL RECEIVE US EVEN IN HIS PRESENT STATE THE EMPEROR'S STATE IS ALWAYS MAGNIFICENT SAID THE MAN
SUGGESTED TIP I CAN'T SAID THE SCARECROW WHY NOT YOU'VE A MOUTH HAVEN'T YOU ASKED THE BOY YES BUT MY MOUTH IS PAINTED ON AND THERE'S NO SWALLOW CONNECTED WITH IT ANSWERED THE SCARECROW IN FACT HE CONTINUED
I EXPECTED THIS BLOW SAID THE SOLDIER SULKILY BUT I CAN BEAR IT I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF BY CUTTING OFF MY LOVELY GREEN WHISKERS AND AFTER ALL
AS A MATTER OF FACT WE ARE NONE OF US ABOVE CRITICISM SO LET US BEAR WITH EACH OTHERS FAULTS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION SAID THE WOGGLE BUG APPROVINGLY YOU MUST HAVE AN EXCELLENT HEART MY METALLIC FRIEND I HAVE
HOW LARGE AN ARMY CAN YOU ASSEMBLE WE DO NOT NEED AN ARMY REPLIED THE WOODMAN WE FOUR WITH THE AID OF MY GLEAMING AXE ARE ENOUGH TO STRIKE TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE REBELS WE FIVE CORRECTED THE PUMPKINHEAD FIVE
KNOWING NO BETTER I USED MY ARMS AS WELL AS MY LEGS FOR WALKING AND CRAWLED UNDER THE EDGES OF STONES OR HID AMONG THE ROOTS OF GRASSES WITH NO THOUGHT BEYOND FINDING A FEW INSECTS SMALLER THAN MYSELF TO FEED UPON
AH THEN YOU WOULD NOT BE FIT TO ASSOCIATE WITH RETURNED THE SCARECROW THE MATTER IS MORE SERIOUS THAN I SUSPECTED YOU SAID THE PUMPKINHEAD GLOOMILY
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU ARE HERE THAT TERRIBLE SAW HORSE RAN AWAY WITH ME I SUSPECTED IT SAID TIP DID YOU GET HURT ARE YOU CRACKED AT ALL
REPEATED THE TIN WOODMAN YES
HAS LATELY CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE NICKEL PLATED GOOD GRACIOUS THE SCARECROW EXCLAIMED AT HEARING THIS IF HIS WIT BEARS THE SAME POLISH HOW SPARKLING IT MUST BE BUT SHOW US IN
BUT ALTHOUGH MANY WERE BEATEN OFF IN THIS WAY THE BIRDS WERE SO NUMEROUS AND SO BRAVE THAT THEY CONTINUED THE ATTACK AS FURIOUSLY AS BEFORE SOME OF THEM PECKED AT THE EYES OF THE GUMP WHICH HUNG OVER THE NEST IN A HELPLESS CONDITION
THE FLUTTER OF THESE GREAT WINGS FILLED THE JACKDAWS WITH TERROR AND WHEN THE GUMP
FOR NO MAN COULD FACE THE TERRIBLE WEAPONS OF THE INVADERS WELL SAID THE SCARECROW AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT
THE FACE OF THE SCARECROW AND MANY PORTIONS OF HIS BODY BORE GREAT BLOTCHES OF PUTZ POMADE FOR THE TIN WOODMAN IN HIS EAGERNESS TO WELCOME HIS FRIEND HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE CONDITION OF HIS TOILET AND HAD RUBBED THE THICK COATING OF PASTE FROM HIS OWN BODY
TO ACCEPT YOUR KIND INVITATION FOR NOWHERE IN THE LAND OF OZ COULD I HOPE TO MEET WITH SO CONGENIAL A COMPANY THAT IS TRUE ACKNOWLEDGED THE PUMPKINHEAD WE ARE QUITE AS CONGENIAL AS FLIES AND HONEY
I WAS PROUD OF MY GREAT SIZE AND REALIZED THAT NOW I COULD SAFELY TRAVEL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHILE MY SUPERIOR CULTURE WOULD MAKE ME A FIT ASSOCIATE FOR THE MOST LEARNED PERSON I MIGHT CHANCE TO MEET SO WHILE THE PROFESSOR PICKED THE LITTLE GIRLS
BUT I WON'T TAKE ANOTHER PILL I PROMISE YOU AND WITH THIS REMARK HE RETIRED SULKILY TO THE BACK OF THE NEST WELL SAID THE WOGGLE BUG IT REMAINS FOR ME TO SAVE US IN MY MOST HIGHLY MAGNIFIED AND THOROUGHLY EDUCATED MANNER FOR I SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE AND WILLING TO MAKE A WISH
THE SCARECROW PLANS AN ESCAPE TIP SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE GIRLS AND FOLLOWED SWIFTLY AFTER THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS
CAUGHT UP INTO KNOTS AND FASTENED WITH TINY SILVER AXES UPON A HANDSOME CENTER TABLE STOOD A LARGE SILVER OIL CAN RICHLY ENGRAVED WITH SCENES FROM THE PAST ADVENTURES OF THE TIN WOODMAN DOROTHY
HE DOESN'T SEEM ESPECIALLY GRACEFUL HE REMARKED MUSINGLY BUT I SUPPOSE HE CAN RUN HE CAN INDEED SAID TIP GAZING UPON THE SAW HORSE ADMIRINGLY
WHO WERE MORE FRIGHTENED THAN HURT OFF THE GROUND AND THE PUPILS CLUSTERED AROUND HIM CLOSELY GROUPED I CALMLY WALKED OUT OF THE SCHOOL HOUSE TURNED A CORNER AND ESCAPED UNNOTICED
DON'T LET'S QUARREL THERE ARE LOWER JOKES THAN SITTING ON A TOP HAT DISLIKE OF THE RED TIED YOUTH BORN OF HIS PREDATORY OPINIONS AND EVIDENT INTIMACY WITH THE PRETTY GODCHILD
SHE HAD WORN AT A FANCY DRESS PARTY AS THE QUEEN OF DIAMONDS INDEED HER UNCLE JAMES BLOUNT WAS GETTING ALMOST OUT OF HAND IN HIS EXCITEMENT HE WAS LIKE A SCHOOLBOY
WHO RUBBED HIS BIG FUR GLOVES TOGETHER LONG BEFORE THIS REVELATION WAS COMPLETE THE TWO BIG DOORS OF THE PORCH HAD OPENED IN THE MIDDLE AND COLONEL ADAMS FATHER OF THE FURRY YOUNG LADY

ALMOST DANCING I'LL BE COLUMBINE AND YOU SHALL BE PANTALOON THE MILLIONAIRE HELD HIMSELF STIFF WITH A SORT OF HEATHEN SOLEMNITY I THINK MY DEAR HE SAID
HE PUT A PAPER DONKEY'S HEAD UNEXPECTEDLY ON FATHER BROWN WHO BORE IT PATIENTLY AND EVEN FOUND SOME PRIVATE MANNER OF MOVING HIS EARS HE EVEN ESSAYED TO PUT THE PAPER DONKEY'S TAIL
OH THAT'S MY GODFATHER SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER HE ALWAYS COMES ON BOXING DAY THEN AFTER AN INNOCENT PAUSE WHICH UNCONSCIOUSLY BETRAYED SOME LACK OF ENTHUSIASM
WITH HIM ALSO WAS THE MORE INSIGNIFICANT FIGURE OF THE PRIEST FROM THE NEIGHBOURING ROMAN CHURCH FOR THE COLONEL'S LATE WIFE HAD BEEN A CATHOLIC AND THE CHILDREN AS IS COMMON IN SUCH CASES HAD BEEN TRAINED TO FOLLOW HER
OH DON'T JUMP MISTER CROOK SHE CALLED OUT IN SOME ALARM IT'S MUCH TOO HIGH THE INDIVIDUAL RIDING THE PARTY WALL LIKE AN AERIAL HORSE
HAD COME OUT HIMSELF TO INVITE HIS EMINENT GUEST INSIDE HE WAS A TALL SUNBURNT AND VERY SILENT MAN WHO WORE A RED SMOKING CAP LIKE A FEZ MAKING HIM LOOK LIKE ONE OF THE ENGLISH SIRDARS
FISCHER STOOD BEAMING BENEVOLENTLY AND DRINKING DEEP OF THE ASTONISHMENT AND ECSTASY OF THE GIRL THE GRIM ADMIRATION AND GRUFF THANKS OF THE COLONEL THE WONDER OF THE WHOLE GROUP
RUBY ADAMS ADDED HE IS VERY KIND JOHN CROOK JOURNALIST HAD HEARD OF THAT EMINENT CITY MAGNATE AND IT WAS NOT HIS FAULT IF THE CITY MAGNATE
HERE SHE GAVE AN EXCLAMATION OF WONDER REAL OR RITUAL AND LOOKING UP AT THE HIGH GARDEN WALL ABOVE HER BEHELD IT FANTASTICALLY BESTRIDDEN BY A SOMEWHAT FANTASTIC FIGURE
HE'S A JOURNALIST AND KNOWS ALL THE OLDEST JOKES I CAN BE HARLEQUIN THAT ONLY WANTS LONG LEGS AND JUMPING ABOUT MY FRIEND FLORIAN PHONES HE'S BRINGING THE POLICE COSTUME HE'S CHANGING ON THE WAY

AND BEGAN TO UNPACK HIM LIKE SOME VERY CAREFULLY PROTECTED PARCEL RUGS ENOUGH TO STOCK A BAZAAR FURS OF ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST AND SCARVES OF ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
WITH SPECULATION IN HIS EYE I'VE HEARD THAT GARDENERS USE IT AND I ONCE MADE SIX CHILDREN HAPPY AT CHRISTMAS WHEN THE CONJUROR DIDN'T COME ENTIRELY WITH SOOT APPLIED EXTERNALLY
DOES A SOCIALIST MEAN A MAN WHO DESIRES A SOCIAL EVENING WITH THE CHIMNEY SWEEP A SOCIALIST MEANS A MAN WHO WANTS ALL THE CHIMNEYS SWEPT AND ALL THE CHIMNEY SWEEPS PAID FOR IT BUT WHO WON'T ALLOW YOU
YOU SEE AN ENGLISH INTERIOR OPEN A MOONLIT GARDEN IT ALL GOES BY MAGIC AND SNATCHING A CHANCE PIECE OF BILLIARD CHALK FROM HIS POCKET HE RAN IT ACROSS THE HALL FLOOR
ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE STOOD THE STABLE ON THE OTHER AN ALLEY OR CLOISTER OF LAURELS LED TO THE LARGER GARDEN BEHIND THE YOUNG LADY HAVING SCATTERED BREAD FOR THE BIRDS
OH SPLENDID CRIED RUBY OH I WISH YOU'D DO IT TO THIS COMPANY THE BOISTEROUS CANADIAN MISTER BLOUNT WAS LIFTING HIS LOUD VOICE IN APPLAUSE
IT'S A BETTER DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM THAN SOME RECENTLY GIVEN BUT SURELY THE GET UP WOULD BE TOO BIG A BUSINESS NOT A SCRAP CRIED BLOUNT QUITE CARRIED AWAY
PREVENTED FROM SMASHING THE OLD VICTORIAN LUSTRE CHANDELIERS THAT HE MIGHT COVER HIMSELF WITH RESPLENDENT CRYSTALS IN FACT HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DONE SO HAD NOT RUBY UNEARTHED SOME OLD PANTOMIME PASTE JEWELS

AND BURROWING MARMOTS MOUNTAIN BEAVERS WOOD RATS AND OTHER SMALL MOUNTAIN PEOPLE GO INTO WINTER QUARTERS SOME OF THEM NOT AGAIN TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY UNTIL THE GENERAL AWAKENING AND RESURRECTION OF THE SPRING
HE DIED WITH COURAGE AND WITH MANY PIOUS EXPRESSIONS BUT SHOWED BY LOOK AND GESTURE SUCH STRONG RESENTMENT AT THE BARBARITY AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED THAT HIS ENEMIES SPREAD A CALUMNIOUS REPORT CONCERNING HIM
NOT TO BE FORGIVEN BATEMAN WAS ARRESTED AND INDICTED THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM WERE MEN OF INFAMOUS CHARACTER MEN TOO WHO WERE SWEARING FOR THEIR OWN LIVES NONE OF THEM HAD YET GOT HIS PARDON
OF WHICH THEY HAD READ IN FOX WILLIAM PENN FOR WHOM EXHIBITIONS WHICH HUMANE MEN GENERALLY AVOID SEEM TO HAVE HAD A STRONG ATTRACTION HASTENED FROM CHEAPSIDE
AND PILING THEIR UPROOTED TREES HEAD DOWNWARD IN ROWS ALONG THE SIDES OF THE GAPS LIKE LATERAL MORAINES SCARS AND BROKEN BRANCHES OF THE TREES STANDING ON THE SIDES OF THE GAPS RECORD THE DEPTH OF THE OVERWHELMING FLOOD
HAD BEEN THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAD FORMED A CORRECT JUDGMENT OF HIS CHARACTER EVEN LEWIS UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH OF THE STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING IN ENGLAND TO BE AWARE THAT THE DIVULGING OF THE TRUTH MIGHT DO HARM
THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY A CRUEL EXPERIENCE THAT THE ANTIPATHY OF THE NATION TO THEIR RELIGION WAS NOT A FANCY WHICH WOULD YIELD TO THE MANDATE OF A PRINCE BUT A PROFOUND SENTIMENT
THEN AWAY IN GRAND STYLE GO THE PONDEROUS ICY MASSES WITHOUT ANY FINE SNOW DUST THOSE OF CLOUDS REST DESCEND LIKE THUNDERBOLTS FOR MORE THAN A MILE
WHOM HE SUPPOSED TO BE OF HIS OWN RELIGIOUS PERSUASION AND ASSURED HER THAT SHE WOULD BE GREATLY EDIFIED AND COMFORTED BY THE PERUSAL IN REQUITAL OF HIS KINDNESS SHE DELIVERED TO HIM A FEW DAYS LATER
THE OPPRESSED PURITANS RECKONED UP NOT WITHOUT A GLOOMY SATISFACTION THE HOUSES WHICH HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN AND THE SHIPS WHICH HAD BEEN CAST AWAY AND DERIVED SOME CONSOLATION FROM THINKING THAT HEAVEN WAS BEARING AWFUL TESTIMONY
AGAINST THE INIQUITY WHICH AFFLICTED THE EARTH SINCE THAT TERRIBLE DAY NO WOMAN HAS SUFFERED DEATH IN ENGLAND
BUT JAMES SUPPOSED THAT THE PRIMATE WAS STRUCK DUMB BY THE IRRESISTIBLE FORCE OF REASON AND EAGERLY CHALLENGED HIS GRACE TO PRODUCE WITH THE HELP OF THE WHOLE EPISCOPAL BENCH A SATISFACTORY REPLY
BEFORE THE SUNSHINE HAD TIME TO CHANGE THEM I SET OUT EARLY TO CLIMB BY A SIDE CANYON TO THE TOP OF A COMMANDING RIDGE A LITTLE OVER THREE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE VALLEY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LOOSENESS OF THE SNOW THAT BLOCKED THE CANYON
I KNEW THE CLIMB WOULD REQUIRE A LONG TIME SOME THREE OR FOUR HOURS AS I ESTIMATED BUT IT PROVED FAR MORE DIFFICULT THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED MOST OF THE WAY I SANK WAIST DEEP
TWO PAPERS IN WHICH WERE SET FORTH VERY CONCISELY THE ARGUMENTS ORDINARILY USED BY ROMAN CATHOLICS IN CONTROVERSY WITH PROTESTANTS HAD BEEN FOUND IN CHARLES'S STRONG BOX
HAD THOUGHT THAT ON THIS POINT IT WAS ADVISABLE TO BE CAUTIOUS AND HAD NOT VENTURED TO INTER HIS BROTHER WITH THE RITES OF THE CHURCH OF ROME FOR A TIME THEREFORE EVERY MAN WAS AT LIBERTY TO BELIEVE WHAT HE WISHED
COMPELLING HUGE SLEEPING BOULDERS TO WAKE UP AND JOIN IN THEIR DANCE AND SONG TO SWELL THEIR EXULTING CHORUS IN EARLY SUMMER AFTER THE FLOOD SEASON THE YOSEMITE STREAMS ARE IN THEIR PRIME
LEAPING FROM BENCH TO BENCH SPREADING AND NARROWING AND THROWING OFF CLOUDS OF WHIRLING DUST LIKE THE SPRAY OF FOAMING CATARACTS COMPARED WITH WATERFALLS AND CASCADES
HAD BEGUN TO FEEL PAINFUL MISGIVINGS AND OCCASIONALLY VENTURED TO HINT A SMALL PART OF WHAT THEY FELT DURING MANY YEARS THE ZEAL OF THE ENGLISH TORY FOR HEREDITARY MONARCHY
FOR THE MEMORY OF HIS DECEASED MASTER THIS PLEA THE KING CONSIDERED AS THE SUBTERFUGE
AND ALL THE LANDSCAPE IS GLOWING LIKE A BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE THEN THE STREAMS ARE AT THEIR LOWEST EBB WITH SCARCE A MEMORY LEFT OF THEIR WILD SPRING FLOODS
HE ORDERED THESE TRACTS TO BE PRINTED WITH THE UTMOST POMP OF TYPOGRAPHY AND APPENDED TO THEM A DECLARATION ATTESTED BY HIS SIGN MANUAL AND CERTIFYING THAT THE ORIGINALS WERE IN HIS BROTHER'S OWN HAND
WHICH MAY BE CALLED ANNUAL AND CENTURY AVALANCHES WHICH STILL FURTHER ENRICH THE SCENERY THE ONLY PLACE ABOUT THE VALLEY WHERE ONE MAY BE SURE TO SEE THE ANNUAL KIND IS ON THE NORTH SLOPE OF CLOUDS REST
WHERE UNDER ORDINARY WEATHER CONDITIONS THE SNOW ACCUMULATED FROM WINTER TO WINTER LIES AT REST FOR MANY YEARS ALLOWING TREES FIFTY TO A HUNDRED FEET HIGH TO GROW UNDISTURBED ON THE SLOPES BENEATH THEM
LET ME HAVE A SOLID ANSWER AND IN A GENTLEMANLIKE STYLE AND IT MAY HAVE THE EFFECT WHICH YOU SO MUCH DESIRE OF BRINGING ME OVER TO YOUR CHURCH
AND APPEARED TO BE IN HIS HANDWRITING THESE PAPERS JAMES SHOWED TRIUMPHANTLY TO SEVERAL PROTESTANTS AND DECLARED THAT TO HIS KNOWLEDGE HIS BROTHER HAD LIVED AND DIED
APPLE PIE ORDER SAID MISTER BOFFIN
IF YOU ENTERED MY EMPLOYMENT WHAT WOULD YOU DO I WOULD KEEP EXACT ACCOUNTS OF ALL THE EXPENDITURE YOU SANCTIONED MISTER BOFFIN I WOULD WRITE YOUR LETTERS UNDER YOUR DIRECTION
WITH A MORBID EXPECTATION MURMURED EUGENE TO LIGHTWOOD THAT SOMEBODY IS ALWAYS GOING TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH THIS IS HEXAM'S BOAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
IF YOU WOULDN'T OBJECT TO STANDING BY HIM HALF A MINUTE SIR WAS THE REPLY I'LL FIND THE NEAREST OF OUR MEN TO COME AND TAKE CHARGE OF HIM I STILL CALL IT HIM YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR LOOKING BACK AS HE WENT WITH A PHILOSOPHICAL SMILE UPON THE FORCE OF HABIT
AND LEANING WELL OVER THE STERN WITH A WILL COME IT WAS AN AWFUL SORT OF FISHING BUT IT NO MORE DISCONCERTED MISTER INSPECTOR THAN IF HE HAD BEEN FISHING IN A PUNT ON A SUMMER EVENING BY SOME SOOTHING WEIR HIGH UP THE PEACEFUL RIVER
HE CAN SWIM CAN THIS MAN AND INSTANTLY HE STRIKES OUT
WE CAN TALK IT OVER NOW CAN'T US MISTER ROKESMITH BOWED THANKED HER AND SAID HE HOPED SO LET ME SEE THEN RESUMED MISTER BOFFIN WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CHIN IT WAS SECRETARY THAT YOU NAMED WASN'T IT
THE THREE WATCHERS LOOKED EACH AT THE BLANK FACES OF THE OTHER TWO
AS HE PASSED THROUGH THESE CURIOUS VICISSITUDES OF FATIGUE AND SLUMBER ARRANGED UPON THE SCALE OF A DOZEN HOURS TO THE SECOND HE BECAME AWARE OF ANSWERING ALOUD A COMMUNICATION OF PRESSING IMPORTANCE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN MADE TO HIM AND THEN TURNED IT INTO A COUGH ON BEHOLDING MISTER INSPECTOR
TO WHOM SHALL IT BE ADDRESSED MISTER BOFFIN ANYONE YOURSELF MISTER ROKESMITH QUICKLY WROTE AND THEN READ ALOUD MISTER BOFFIN PRESENTS HIS COMPLIMENTS TO MISTER JOHN ROKESMITH
RELINQUISHING HIS HAT AND GLOVES MISTER ROKESMITH SAT DOWN QUIETLY AT THE TABLE ARRANGED THE OPEN PAPERS INTO AN ORDERLY HEAP CAST HIS EYES OVER EACH IN SUCCESSION FOLDED IT DOCKETED IT ON THE OUTSIDE LAID IT IN A SECOND HEAP
AND BEGS TO SAY THAT HE HAS DECIDED ON GIVING MISTER JOHN ROKESMITH A TRIAL IN THE CAPACITY HE DESIRES TO FILL MISTER BOFFIN TAKES MISTER JOHN ROKESMITH AT HIS WORD IN POSTPONING TO SOME INDEFINITE PERIOD THE CONSIDERATION OF SALARY IT IS QUITE UNDERSTOOD
I SAID SECRETARY ASSENTED MISTER ROKESMITH IT RATHER PUZZLED ME AT THE TIME SAID MISTER BOFFIN AND IT RATHER PUZZLED ME AND MISSUS BOFFIN WHEN WE SPOKE OF IT AFTERWARDS BECAUSE NOT TO MAKE A MYSTERY OF OUR BELIEF
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER THAT I'VE NOT HAD TIME TO TURN YOUR OFFER OVER THAT'S APOLOGY FOR BOTH OF US FOR MISTER BOFFIN AND FOR ME AS WELL SAID THE SMILING MISSUS BOFFIN BUT LOR
NOT SO EASY DONE HIS LUCK'S GOT FOULED UNDER THE KEELS OF THE BARGES I TRIED TO HAUL IN LAST TIME BUT I COULDN'T SEE HOW TAUT THE LINE IS
GAVE HIM HIS HAND IN PLEDGE OF THEIR NEW RELATIONS SO DID MISSUS BOFFIN NOW SAID MISTER BOFFIN WHO IN HIS FRANKNESS FELT THAT IT DID NOT BECOME HIM TO HAVE A GENTLEMAN IN HIS EMPLOYMENT FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT REPOSING SOME CONFIDENCE IN HIM
ALL RIGHT GIVE WAY SAID LIGHTWOOD GIVE WAY BY GEORGE REPEATED RIDERHOOD BEFORE SHOVING OFF IF HE'S GONE AND MADE OFF ANY HOW LAWYER LIGHTWOOD IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE ME GIVE WAY IN A DIFFERENT MANNER
BUT THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW FASHIONABLE WE MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT GROW WELL MISSUS BOFFIN HAS CARRIED THE DAY AND WE'RE GOING IN NECK AND CROP FOR FASHION I RATHER INFERRED THAT SIR REPLIED JOHN ROKESMITH
AND YOU WILL OBSERVE NOW THAT THIS KNOT WHICH WAS DRAWN CHOCK TIGHT ROUND HIS NECK BY THE STRAIN OF HIS OWN ARMS IS A SLIP KNOT HOLDING IT UP FOR DEMONSTRATION PLAIN ENOUGH
NOW SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR SEE HOW IT WORKS ROUND UPON HIM IT'S A WILD TEMPESTUOUS EVENING WHEN THIS MAN THAT WAS STOOPING TO WIPE SOME HAILSTONES OUT OF HIS HAIR WITH AN END OF HIS OWN DROWNED JACKET THERE
ACCEPTING LIGHTWOOD'S PROFFERED HAND TO HELP HIM UP HE THEN PUT ON HIS COAT AND SAID TO RIDERHOOD HAND ME OVER THOSE SPARE SCULLS OF YOURS AND I'LL PULL THIS IN TO THE NEAREST STAIRS GO AHEAD YOU AND KEEP OUT IN PRETTY OPEN WATER THAT I MAYN'T GET FOULED AGAIN
AS MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD SAT BEFORE THE BLAZING FIRE CONSCIOUS OF DRINKING BRANDY AND WATER THEN AND THERE IN HIS SLEEP AND YET AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME DRINKING BURNT SHERRY AT THE SIX JOLLY FELLOWSHIPS AND LYING UNDER THE BOAT ON THE RIVER SHORE AND SITTING IN THE BOAT THAT RIDERHOOD ROWED
SO MUCH COACH MAKER'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH HORSE DEALER'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH HARNESS MAKER'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH GOLDSMITH'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH TOTAL SO VERY MUCH THEN CAME CORRESPONDENCE
DISCOLOURED COPPER ROTTEN WOOD HONEY COMBED STONE GREEN DANK DEPOSIT THAT THE AFTER CONSEQUENCES OF BEING CRUSHED SUCKED UNDER AND DRAWN DOWN LOOKED AS UGLY TO THE IMAGINATION AS THE MAIN EVENT
MISTER INSPECTOR HAVING TO MISTER RIDERHOOD ANNOUNCED HIS OFFICIAL INTENTION OF KEEPING HIS EYE UPON HIM STOOD HIM IN A CORNER OF THE FIREPLACE LIKE A WET UMBRELLA AND TOOK NO FURTHER OUTWARD AND VISIBLE NOTICE OF THAT HONEST MAN
WHEN HE CAME SCRAMBLING BACK AS PALE AS THE MORNING AND GASPED OUT BY THE LORD HE'S DONE ME
WITH AN EXCEEDINGLY DISTRUSTFUL AND CORRECTIVE THUMB
AND HARD WORK HOLDING FORTH AT THAT IMMEASURABLE LENGTH TO EUGENE WHEN HE HAD BEEN RESCUED WITH A ROPE FROM THE RUNNING PAVEMENT FOR MAKING OFF IN THAT EXTRAORDINARY MANNER BUT HE OFFERED SUCH AMPLE APOLOGIES AND WAS SO VERY PENITENT
WORDS NEVER TO BE ANSWERED THOSE UPON THE EARTH SIDE OF THE GRAVE THE WIND SWEEPS JEERINGLY OVER FATHER WHIPS HIM WITH THE FRAYED ENDS OF HIS DRESS AND HIS JAGGED HAIR
AND LISTENING TO THE LECTURE RECENTLY CONCLUDED AND HAVING TO DINE IN THE TEMPLE WITH AN UNKNOWN MAN WHO DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS M H F EUGENE GAFFER HARMON AND SAID HE LIVED AT HAILSTORM
LET US HEAR WHAT THEY'RE ALL ABOUT WILL YOU BE SO GOOD JOHN ROKESMITH READ HIS ABSTRACTS ALOUD THEY WERE ALL ABOUT THE NEW HOUSE DECORATOR'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH FURNITURE ESTIMATE SO MUCH ESTIMATE FOR FURNITURE OF OFFICES
HE MAKES IT TOO SECURE AS IT HAPPENS HE IS A LITTLE LONGER ABOUT THIS THAN USUAL HIS HANDS BEING NUMBED
THE WITCH OF THE NORTH SEEMED TO THINK FOR A TIME WITH HER HEAD BOWED AND HER EYES UPON THE GROUND THEN SHE LOOKED UP AND SAID I DO NOT KNOW WHERE KANSAS IS FOR I HAVE NEVER HEARD THAT COUNTRY MENTIONED BEFORE BUT TELL ME
YOU MUST BE A GREAT SORCERESS WHY ASKED THE GIRL
FINDING IT JUST WHAT SHE WANTED TO HELP OUT HER BREAKFAST THEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE AND HAVING HELPED HERSELF AND TOTO TO A GOOD DRINK OF THE COOL CLEAR WATER SHE SET ABOUT MAKING READY FOR THE JOURNEY TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS
WHAT WORRIED HER MOST WAS THAT THE BREAD WAS NEARLY GONE AND ANOTHER MEAL FOR HERSELF AND TOTO WOULD EMPTY THE BASKET TO BE SURE NEITHER THE WOODMAN NOR THE SCARECROW EVER ATE ANYTHING
SHE CARRIED IT DOWN TO THE LITTLE BROOK AND FILLED IT WITH CLEAR SPARKLING WATER TOTO RAN OVER TO THE TREES AND BEGAN TO BARK AT THE BIRDS SITTING THERE DOROTHY WENT TO GET HIM AND SAW SUCH DELICIOUS FRUIT HANGING FROM THE BRANCHES THAT SHE GATHERED SOME OF IT
AND WHY IS THAT ASKED THE SCARECROW I WILL TELL YOU MY STORY AND THEN YOU WILL KNOW SO WHILE THEY WERE WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST THE TIN WOODMAN TOLD THE FOLLOWING STORY
WON'T YOU GO WITH ME PLEADED THE GIRL WHO HAD BEGUN TO LOOK UPON THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN AS HER ONLY FRIEND NO I CANNOT DO THAT SHE REPLIED BUT I WILL GIVE YOU MY KISS AND NO ONE WILL DARE INJURE A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN KISSED BY THE WITCH OF THE NORTH
ANSWERED THE WITCH SINKING HER VOICE TO A WHISPER HE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN ALL THE REST OF US TOGETHER HE LIVES IN THE CITY OF EMERALDS DOROTHY WAS GOING TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION BUT JUST THEN
SAID THE GIRL WHO WAS HALF FRIGHTENED AT FACING A REAL WITCH OH NO THAT IS A GREAT MISTAKE THERE WERE ONLY FOUR WITCHES IN ALL THE LAND OF OZ AND TWO OF THEM
WHILE I WAS IN LOVE I WAS THE HAPPIEST MAN ON EARTH BUT NO ONE CAN LOVE WHO HAS NOT A HEART AND SO I AM RESOLVED TO ASK OZ TO GIVE ME ONE IF HE DOES I WILL GO BACK TO THE MUNCHKIN MAIDEN AND MARRY HER
EVIDENTLY THE MUNCHKINS WERE GOOD FARMERS AND ABLE TO RAISE LARGE CROPS ONCE IN A WHILE SHE WOULD PASS A HOUSE AND THE PEOPLE CAME OUT TO LOOK AT HER AND BOW LOW AS SHE WENT BY FOR EVERYONE KNEW SHE HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF DESTROYING THE WICKED WITCH AND SETTING THEM FREE FROM BONDAGE
DOROTHY HAD ONLY ONE OTHER DRESS BUT THAT HAPPENED TO BE CLEAN AND WAS HANGING ON A PEG BESIDE HER BED IT WAS GINGHAM WITH CHECKS OF WHITE AND BLUE AND ALTHOUGH THE BLUE WAS SOMEWHAT FADED WITH MANY WASHINGS IT WAS STILL A PRETTY FROCK
THERE WAS ONLY ONE DANGER THAT MY JOINTS WOULD RUST BUT I KEPT AN OIL CAN IN MY COTTAGE AND TOOK CARE TO OIL MYSELF WHENEVER I NEEDED IT HOWEVER THERE CAME A DAY WHEN I FORGOT TO DO THIS AND BEING CAUGHT IN A RAINSTORM BEFORE I THOUGHT OF THE DANGER MY JOINTS HAD RUSTED
DO YOU THINK HE ASKED IF I GO TO THE EMERALD CITY WITH YOU THAT OZ WOULD GIVE ME SOME BRAINS I CANNOT TELL SHE RETURNED BUT YOU MAY COME WITH ME IF YOU LIKE
SAID THE SCARECROW WITH A SMILE FOR IT IS VERY TEDIOUS BEING PERCHED UP HERE NIGHT AND DAY TO SCARE AWAY CROWS CAN'T YOU GET DOWN ASKED DOROTHY NO FOR THIS POLE IS STUCK UP MY BACK
DOROTHY LISTENED TO THIS SPEECH WITH WONDER WHAT COULD THE LITTLE WOMAN POSSIBLY MEAN BY CALLING HER A SORCERESS AND SAYING SHE HAD KILLED THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST DOROTHY WAS AN INNOCENT HARMLESS LITTLE GIRL
BUT MY ACTION ANGERED THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST FOR SHE HAD PROMISED THE OLD WOMAN I SHOULD NOT MARRY THE PRETTY MUNCHKIN GIRL WHEN I BEGAN CHOPPING AGAIN MY AXE SLIPPED AND CUT OFF MY RIGHT LEG AGAIN I WENT TO THE TINSMITH AND AGAIN HE MADE ME A LEG OUT OF TIN
SHE WAS SURPRISED AS SHE WALKED ALONG TO SEE HOW PRETTY THE COUNTRY WAS ABOUT HER THERE WERE NEAT FENCES AT THE SIDES OF THE ROAD PAINTED A DAINTY BLUE COLOR AND BEYOND THEM WERE FIELDS OF GRAIN AND VEGETABLES IN ABUNDANCE
THERE WERE LOVELY PATCHES OF GREENSWARD ALL ABOUT WITH STATELY TREES BEARING RICH AND LUSCIOUS FRUITS BANKS OF GORGEOUS FLOWERS WERE ON EVERY HAND AND BIRDS WITH RARE AND BRILLIANT PLUMAGE SANG AND FLUTTERED IN THE TREES AND BUSHES
THEY TURNED AND WALKED THROUGH THE FOREST A FEW STEPS WHEN DOROTHY DISCOVERED SOMETHING SHINING IN A RAY OF SUNSHINE THAT FELL BETWEEN THE TREES SHE RAN TO THE PLACE AND THEN STOPPED SHORT WITH A LITTLE CRY OF SURPRISE
THE COUNCIL WITH THE MUNCHKINS SHE WAS AWAKENED BY A SHOCK SO SUDDEN AND SEVERE THAT IF DOROTHY HAD NOT BEEN LYING ON THE SOFT BED SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HURT AS IT WAS THE JAR MADE HER CATCH HER BREATH AND WONDER WHAT HAD HAPPENED
AND THEN THE MAN COULD TURN IT HIMSELF
AUNT EM HAS TOLD ME THAT THE WITCHES WERE ALL DEAD YEARS AND YEARS AGO WHO IS AUNT EM INQUIRED THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN
AND ARE GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR THE FAVOR WHO ARE THE MUNCHKINS INQUIRED DOROTHY THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THIS LAND OF THE EAST WHERE THE WICKED WITCH RULED ARE YOU A MUNCHKIN ASKED DOROTHY NO BUT I AM THEIR FRIEND
I SHALL NOT MIND IT FOR I CAN'T GET TIRED I'LL TELL YOU A SECRET HE CONTINUED AS HE WALKED ALONG THERE IS ONLY ONE THING IN THE WORLD I AM AFRAID OF WHAT IS THAT ASKED DOROTHY
I WOULD NEED THE OIL CAN BADLY IT WAS A BIT OF GOOD LUCK TO HAVE THEIR NEW COMRADE JOIN THE PARTY FOR SOON AFTER THEY HAD BEGUN THEIR JOURNEY AGAIN THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THE TREES AND BRANCHES GREW SO THICK OVER THE ROAD
BUT THE GIRL LIVED WITH AN OLD WOMAN WHO DID NOT WANT HER TO MARRY ANYONE FOR SHE WAS SO LAZY SHE WISHED THE GIRL TO REMAIN WITH HER AND DO THE COOKING AND THE HOUSEWORK SO THE OLD WOMAN WENT TO THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST AND PROMISED HER TWO SHEEP AND A COW IF SHE WOULD PREVENT THE MARRIAGE
AND IT WILL TAKE YOU MANY DAYS THE COUNTRY HERE IS RICH AND PLEASANT BUT YOU MUST PASS THROUGH ROUGH AND DANGEROUS PLACES BEFORE YOU REACH THE END OF YOUR JOURNEY THIS WORRIED DOROTHY A LITTLE
THAT IS TRUE SAID THE SCARECROW YOU SEE HE CONTINUED CONFIDENTIALLY I DON'T MIND MY LEGS AND ARMS AND BODY BEING STUFFED BECAUSE I CANNOT GET HURT IF ANYONE TREADS ON MY TOES OR STICKS A PIN INTO ME IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR I CAN'T FEEL IT
WITH THE FLAT OF MY SWORD I STRUCK DOWN HIS POLLUTING HAND AND GRASPING DEJAH THORIS ROUND THE WAIST I SWUNG HER BEHIND ME AS WITH MY BACK AGAINST THE DRAPERIES OF THE DAIS I FACED THE TYRANT OF THE NORTH AND HIS ROOMFUL OF NOBLE WARRIORS
THE MESSENGER STAGGERED BACK IN HORROR AS THOUGH FROM A BLOW IN THE FACE THEN FLY NOBLES OF OKAR HE CRIED FOR NAUGHT CAN SAVE YOU HARK THEY COME AS HE SPOKE WE HEARD THE DEEP ROAR OF ANGRY MEN FROM THE CORRIDOR WITHOUT
IT WAS NO TRIFLING JOB THAT HOR VASTUS HAD BEFORE HIM AFTER THEY HAD LEFT I BID CARTHORIS GOOD NIGHT FOR I WAS VERY TIRED AND GOING TO MY OWN APARTMENTS BATHED AND LAY DOWN UPON MY SLEEPING SILKS AND FURS FOR THE FIRST GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
I HAD BACKED INTO THE PIT WHICH HAD RECEIVED ISSUS FOR A SECOND I TOPPLED THERE UPON THE BRINK THEN I TOO WITH THE BOY STILL TIGHTLY CLUTCHED IN MY ARMS PITCHED BACKWARD INTO THE BLACK ABYSS WE STRUCK A POLISHED CHUTE
THE FORMER AGREED TO TAKE SUCH VESSELS AS WE REQUIRED INTO DOCK AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE
I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR LOVING HIM THUVIA SHE SAID AND THAT YOUR AFFECTION FOR HIM IS PURE AND SINCERE I CAN WELL BELIEVE FROM THE CANDOUR OF YOUR AVOWAL OF IT TO ME THE FLEET CONTINUED NORTH NEARLY TO HELIUM BUT LAST NIGHT THEY EVIDENTLY REALIZED THAT JOHN CARTER HAD INDEED ESCAPED THEM
WITH A SNARL HE SPRANG TOWARD ME WITH NAKED SWORD BUT WHETHER SALENSUS OLL WAS A GOOD SWORDSMAN OR A POOR I NEVER LEARNED FOR WITH DEJAH THORIS AT MY BACK I WAS NO LONGER HUMAN I WAS A SUPERMAN AND NO MAN COULD HAVE WITHSTOOD ME THEN
SHE TOLD DEJAH THORIS THAT MANY YEARS AGO SHE HAD TAKEN THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE FROM THE COURT OF HER FATHER THE JEDDAK OF PTARTH SHE WAS THUVIA THE PRINCESS OF PTARTH AND THEN SHE ASKED DEJAH THORIS WHO SHE MIGHT BE
THAT ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO INSPIRE ME TO VICTORY OVER EVEN GREATER ODDS AND I VERILY BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BESTED THE ENTIRE ROOMFUL OF YELLOW WARRIORS THAT DAY IN THE NUPTIAL CHAMBER OF THE PALACE AT KADABRA HAD NOT INTERRUPTION COME TO MY AID
FROM THE CORRIDOR UNDETECTED PRESENTLY I SAW A SERIES OF DOORS OPENING FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE CORRIDOR AND AS THEY ALL LOOKED ALIKE TO ME I TRIED THE FIRST ONE THAT I REACHED IT OPENED INTO A SMALL CHAMBER LUXURIOUSLY FURNISHED
AND I THINK ONCE OUT THAT WE SHALL FIND NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ARMING OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN A COUNTRY WHICH ABOUNDS SO PLENTIFULLY IN ARMED MEN AS YOU SAY HE REPLIED WITH A SMILE AND SHRUG
THE OPENING ABOVE US CLOSED AS MAGICALLY AS IT HAD OPENED AND WE SHOT DOWN UNHARMED INTO A DIMLY LIGHTED APARTMENT FAR BELOW THE ARENA AS I ROSE TO MY FEET THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS THE MALIGNANT COUNTENANCE OF ISSUS GLARING AT ME
AND I FOUGHT FOR A GREAT LOVE AND FOR THE MOTHER OF MY BOY AND FROM BEHIND MY SHOULDER IN THE SILVERY CADENCE OF THAT DEAR VOICE ROSE THE BRAVE BATTLE ANTHEM OF HELIUM WHICH THE NATION'S WOMEN SING AS THEIR MEN MARCH OUT TO VICTORY
WHAT I WAS MOST CONCERNED IN OF COURSE WAS THE RESCUING OF DEJAH THORIS
AND AS ONE THEY ENLISTED WITH ME TO FOLLOW OUR BELOVED PRINCESS IN HER WANDERINGS EVEN TO THE SACRED ISS AND THE VALLEY DOR WE CAME UPON HER BUT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE PALACE WITH HER WAS FAITHFUL WOOLA THE HOUND BUT NONE OTHER
ONCE WITHIN THE PALACE I DREW SOLA TO THE DINING HALL AND WHEN SHE HAD GREETED HER FATHER AFTER THE FORMAL MANNER OF THE GREEN MEN SHE TOLD THE STORY OF THE PILGRIMAGE AND CAPTURE OF DEJAH THORIS SEVEN DAYS AGO AFTER HER AUDIENCE WITH ZAT ARRAS DEJAH THORIS ATTEMPTED TO SLIP FROM THE PALACE IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT
KANTOS KAN HE WAS LEADING THE LITTLE PARTY THAT HAD WON ITS WAY INTO THE VERY HEART OF THE PALACE OF SALENSUS OLL IN AN INSTANT I SAW THAT BY ATTACKING THE OKARIANS FROM THE REAR I COULD SO QUICKLY DISORGANIZE THEM THAT THEIR FURTHER RESISTANCE WOULD BE SHORT LIVED
HE ALONE MAY REVIVE THE FLAGGING COURAGE OF OUR WARRIORS HE ALONE MAY SAVE THE DAY FOR OKAR WHERE IS SALENSUS OLL THE NOBLES STEPPED BACK FROM ABOUT THE DEAD BODY OF THEIR RULER AND ONE OF THEM POINTED TO THE GRINNING CORPSE
AS I WATCHED THE PROCESSION THAT MOVED SLOWLY TOWARD THE THRONE A PROCESSION WHICH CONSISTED OF BUT A HANDFUL OF PRIESTS WHO FOLLOWED DEJAH THORIS AND THE TWO GUARDSMEN I CAUGHT A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF A BLACK FACE PEERING FROM BEHIND THE DRAPERIES
FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME AT LEAST THEY WILL BE COMPARATIVELY SAFE HE SAID AND WE WILL AT LEAST KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR THEM
TORITH TOOK A HALF STEP TOWARD THE ENTRANCE TO THE POOL AS THOUGH TO CORROBORATE MY STORY FOR THAT INSTANT EVERYTHING HUNG IN THE BALANCE FOR HAD HE DONE SO AND FOUND THE EMPTY SUBMARINE STILL LYING AT HER WHARF THE WHOLE WEAK FABRIC OF MY CONCOCTION
THE RESULT OF WHICH IS SHOWN IN THE PRESENT SPLENDID RACE OF RED MEN I HAD ALWAYS SUPPOSED THAT ALL TRACES OF THE ORIGINAL RACES HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE FACE OF MARS YET WITHIN THE PAST FOUR DAYS I HAD FOUND BOTH WHITES AND BLACKS IN GREAT MULTITUDES
THE GUARDS BELOW THERE THE GUARDS WE WERE CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND ALL SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN RUN QUICKLY ACROSS A LITTLE PIECE OF SWARD AND DISAPPEAR IN THE SHRUBBERY BEYOND HE WAS ON THE BALCONY WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM CRIED HOR VASTUS QUICK LET US FOLLOW HIM
WHO WAS EMERGING FROM HIS OFFICE TO LEARN THE CAUSE OF THE COMMOTION THE BLACK READ THE ORDER AND FOR A MOMENT EYED US WITH EVIDENT SUSPICION
SO THAT TO ME WAS LEFT THE REMNANTS OF THE YELLOW MEN WITHIN THE THRONEROOM THEY KEPT ME BUSY TOO
UPON WHICH STOOD SALENSUS OLL AWAITING HIS BRIDE NOW THE GUARDSMEN WERE FORCING THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM UP THE FEW STEPS TO THE SIDE OF THE TYRANT OF OKAR AND I HAD NO EYES AND NO THOUGHTS FOR AUGHT ELSE A PRIEST OPENED A BOOK AND RAISING HIS HAND
WHEN THEY HAD COME INTO THE CORRIDOR WITH ME THEY TURNED TOWARD A SECRET PANEL IN THE WALL WHICH LED TO THE PASSAGE THAT TERMINATED IN THE PITS BENEATH THE PALACE THAT ANY KNEW OF THIS PANEL OUTSIDE MY OWN HOUSEHOLD I WAS DOUBTFUL YET THE LEADER OF THE BAND DID NOT HESITATE A MOMENT
ON A LEVEL FLOOR OF SOFT SAND VERY QUIETLY I LOWERED MYSELF FROM THE INKY CELL ABOVE INTO THE INKY PIT BELOW SO UTTERLY DARK WAS IT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE OUR HANDS AT AN INCH FROM OUR NOSES NEVER I THINK
THEY DID NOT EAT MUCH LESS DIGEST INSTEAD THEY TOOK THE FRESH LIVING BLOOD OF OTHER CREATURES AND INJECTED IT INTO THEIR OWN VEINS I HAVE MYSELF SEEN THIS BEING DONE AS I SHALL MENTION IN ITS PLACE BUT
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN THESE STRUCTURES AND HAVE ONLY THE ILL IMAGINED EFFORTS OF ARTISTS OR THE IMPERFECT DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH EYE WITNESSES AS MYSELF TO GO UPON SCARCELY REALISE THAT LIVING QUALITY I RECALL PARTICULARLY THE ILLUSTRATION
AND I ASSERT THAT I WATCHED THEM CLOSELY TIME AFTER TIME AND THAT I HAVE SEEN FOUR FIVE AND ONCE SIX OF THEM SLUGGISHLY PERFORMING THE MOST ELABORATELY COMPLICATED OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITHOUT EITHER SOUND OR GESTURE THEIR PECULIAR HOOTING
AND THE FIRST NAUSEA NO LONGER OBSCURED MY OBSERVATION MOREOVER I WAS CONCEALED AND MOTIONLESS AND UNDER NO URGENCY OF ACTION THEY WERE I NOW SAW THE MOST UNEARTHLY CREATURES IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE THEY WERE HUGE ROUND BODIES
WHILE I WAS STILL DOUBTFUL IT RAPPED SMARTLY AGAINST THE CELLAR DOOR AND CLOSED IT I HEARD IT GO INTO THE PANTRY AND THE BISCUIT TINS RATTLED AND A BOTTLE SMASHED AND THEN CAME A HEAVY BUMP AGAINST THE CELLAR DOOR THEN SILENCE THAT PASSED
AND MOVING FEEBLY AFTER THEIR VAST JOURNEY ACROSS SPACE WHILE I WAS STILL WATCHING THEIR SLUGGISH MOTIONS IN THE SUNLIGHT AND NOTING EACH STRANGE DETAIL OF THEIR FORM THE CURATE REMINDED ME OF HIS PRESENCE BY PULLING VIOLENTLY AT MY ARM I TURNED TO A SCOWLING FACE
WITHOUT ANY OF THE EMOTIONAL SUBSTRATUM OF THE HUMAN BEING THE LAST SALIENT POINT IN WHICH THE SYSTEMS OF THESE CREATURES DIFFERED FROM OURS
EVEN AS I SAW THESE MARTIANS FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY SEEMED TO BE ENDEAVOURING TO RAISE THEMSELVES ON THESE HANDS BUT OF COURSE WITH THE INCREASED WEIGHT OF TERRESTRIAL CONDITIONS THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE THERE IS REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT ON MARS THEY MAY HAVE PROGRESSED UPON THEM WITH SOME FACILITY
OR HAS PREFERRED OTHER EXPEDIENTS TO ITS DEVELOPMENT AND NOT ONLY DID THE MARTIANS EITHER NOT KNOW OF WHICH IS INCREDIBLE OR ABSTAIN FROM THE WHEEL BUT IN THEIR APPARATUS SINGULARLY LITTLE USE IS MADE OF THE FIXED PIVOT OR RELATIVELY FIXED PIVOT WITH CIRCULAR MOTIONS THEREABOUT CONFINED
SINCE KNOWN TO BE ANATOMICALLY AN EAR THOUGH IT MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST USELESS
THE TUNICATES THE TWO PROCESSES OCCUR SIDE BY SIDE BUT FINALLY THE SEXUAL METHOD SUPERSEDED ITS COMPETITOR ALTOGETHER ON MARS HOWEVER JUST THE REVERSE HAS APPARENTLY BEEN THE CASE
AND NOT ONLY WERE THEY EVIDENTLY MUCH LESS SENSIBLE OF CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE THAN WE ARE BUT CHANGES OF PRESSURE DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE AFFECTED THEIR HEALTH AT ALL SERIOUSLY YET THOUGH THEY WORE NO CLOTHING
AND SEEMED TO GO OUT OF THE CELLAR AGAIN FOR A MINUTE I WAS NOT SURE APPARENTLY IT HAD TAKEN A LUMP OF COAL TO EXAMINE I SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF SLIGHTLY SHIFTING MY POSITION WHICH HAD BECOME CRAMPED AND THEN LISTENED
PERHAPS NOTHING IS MORE WONDERFUL TO A MAN THAN THE CURIOUS FACT THAT WHAT IS THE DOMINANT FEATURE OF ALMOST ALL HUMAN DEVICES IN MECHANISM IS ABSENT THE WHEEL IS ABSENT
AND NOTHING I COULD DO WOULD MODERATE HIS SPEECH IT IS JUST O GOD HE WOULD SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT IS JUST ON ME AND MINE BE THE PUNISHMENT LAID WE HAVE SINNED WE HAVE FALLEN SHORT THERE WAS POVERTY SORROW
THEN HE WOULD SUDDENLY REVERT TO THE MATTER OF THE FOOD I WITHHELD FROM HIM PRAYING BEGGING WEEPING AT LAST THREATENING HE BEGAN TO RAISE HIS VOICE I PRAYED HIM NOT TO HE PERCEIVED A HOLD ON ME
AND TWISTING AND TURNING WITH QUEER SUDDEN MOVEMENTS THIS WAY AND THAT FOR A WHILE I STOOD FASCINATED BY THAT SLOW FITFUL ADVANCE THEN WITH A FAINT HOARSE CRY I FORCED MYSELF ACROSS THE SCULLERY I TREMBLED VIOLENTLY
INTO A SHAPE HAVING AN UNMISTAKABLE LIKENESS TO ITS OWN AND DOWN ON THE LEFT A BUSY LITTLE DIGGING MECHANISM HAD COME INTO VIEW EMITTING JETS OF GREEN VAPOUR AND WORKING ITS WAY ROUND THE PIT EXCAVATING AND EMBANKING IN A METHODICAL AND DISCRIMINATING MANNER
THEY HAVE BECOME PRACTICALLY MERE BRAINS WEARING DIFFERENT BODIES ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS JUST AS MEN WEAR SUITS OF CLOTHES AND TAKE A BICYCLE IN A HURRY OR AN UMBRELLA IN THE WET AND OF THEIR APPLIANCES
OVER THAT ASPECT WE HUNG NOW ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE GREAT CIRCULAR PIT THE MARTIANS WERE ENGAGED IN MAKING THE HEAVY BEATING SOUND WAS EVIDENTLY JUST BEHIND US AND EVER AND AGAIN A BRIGHT GREEN VAPOUR DROVE UP LIKE A VEIL ACROSS OUR PEEPHOLE
AND I HELD MY PEACE I PREACHED ACCEPTABLE FOLLY MY GOD WHAT FOLLY WHEN I SHOULD HAVE STOOD UP THOUGH I DIED FOR IT AND CALLED UPON THEM TO REPENT REPENT OPPRESSORS OF THE POOR AND NEEDY THE WINE PRESS OF GOD
AND THEREFORE WITHOUT ANY OF THE TUMULTUOUS EMOTIONS THAT ARISE FROM THAT DIFFERENCE AMONG MEN A YOUNG MARTIAN THERE CAN NOW BE NO DISPUTE WAS REALLY BORN UPON EARTH DURING THE WAR AND IT WAS FOUND ATTACHED TO ITS PARENT PARTIALLY BUDDED OFF
AND THAT THE TENDENCY OF NATURAL SELECTION WOULD LIE IN THE DIRECTION OF THEIR STEADY DIMINUTION THROUGH THE COMING AGES THE BRAIN ALONE REMAINED A CARDINAL NECESSITY ONLY ONE OTHER PART OF THE BODY HAD A STRONG CASE FOR SURVIVAL AND THAT WAS THE HAND
FROM CERTAIN VAGUE MEMORIES I AM INCLINED TO THINK MY OWN MIND WANDERED AT TIMES I HAD STRANGE AND HIDEOUS DREAMS WHENEVER I SLEPT IT SOUNDS PARADOXICAL BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE WEAKNESS AND INSANITY OF THE CURATE WARNED ME BRACED ME AND KEPT ME A SANE MAN
AND ALWAYS FROTHY REPENTANCE FOR HIS VACANT SHAM OF GOD'S SERVICE SUCH AS MADE ME PITY HIM THEN HE SLEPT AWHILE AND BEGAN AGAIN WITH RENEWED STRENGTH SO LOUDLY THAT I MUST NEEDS MAKE HIM DESIST BE STILL I IMPLORED
I WHISPERED FOR THE CURATE SEVERAL TIMES AND AT LAST FELT MY WAY TO THE DOOR OF THE KITCHEN IT WAS STILL DAYLIGHT AND I PERCEIVED HIM ACROSS THE ROOM LYING AGAINST THE TRIANGULAR HOLE THAT LOOKED OUT UPON THE MARTIANS
I HAD BEEN DOZING BUT IN AN INSTANT I WAS AWAKE ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT WE SAT FACE TO FACE I WEARY BUT RESOLUTE AND HE WEEPING AND COMPLAINING OF HIS IMMEDIATE HUNGER
OUR BODIES ARE HALF MADE UP OF GLANDS AND TUBES AND ORGANS OCCUPIED IN TURNING HETEROGENEOUS FOOD INTO BLOOD THE DIGESTIVE PROCESSES AND THEIR REACTION UPON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SAP OUR STRENGTH AND COLOUR OUR MINDS
I HAVE BEEN STILL TOO LONG HE SAID IN A TONE THAT MUST HAVE REACHED THE PIT
THE ANTITHESIS OF THE NORMAL MAN THAT IS THE MAN OF ACUTE CONSCIOUSNESS WHO HAS COME OF COURSE NOT OUT OF THE LAP OF NATURE BUT OUT OF A RETORT THIS IS ALMOST MYSTICISM GENTLEMEN BUT I SUSPECT THIS TOO
HER JUDGMENT OF MEN AND THINGS THOUGH BASED ON SPECIAL PREJUDICES WAS SELDOM TOTALLY WRONG AND ALMOST NEVER WRONG HEADED HER DRAWING ROOM WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WIDE WORLD WHERE AN ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
THAT MADE THE GROUNDLESS FAME OF HIS CONDEMNATION THE FAME OF HIS RELEASE WAS MADE FOR HIM ON NO BETTER GROUNDS BY PEOPLE WHO WISHED TO EXPLOIT THE SENTIMENTAL ASPECT OF HIS IMPRISONMENT EITHER FOR PURPOSES OF THEIR OWN
WITH AN UNEXPECTED DEPTH OF FEELING EIGHTEEN STONE I SHOULD SAY AND NOT FIVE FOOT SIX POOR FELLOW IT'S TERRIBLE TERRIBLE THE LADY OF THE HOUSE GAZING ABSENTLY AT THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
BUT STILL IF I DON'T CONSULT A DOCTOR IT IS FROM SPITE MY LIVER IS BAD WELL LET IT GET WORSE I HAVE BEEN GOING ON LIKE THAT FOR A LONG TIME TWENTY YEARS NOW I AM FORTY I USED TO BE IN THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE
A CERTAIN SIMPLICITY OF THOUGHT IS COMMON TO SERENE SOULS AT BOTH ENDS OF THE SOCIAL SCALE THE GREAT LADY WAS SIMPLE IN HER OWN WAY HIS VIEWS AND BELIEFS HAD NOTHING IN THEM TO SHOCK OR STARTLE HER
BUT ENOUGH NOT ANOTHER WORD ON THAT SUBJECT OF SUCH EXTREME INTEREST TO YOU I WILL CONTINUE CALMLY CONCERNING PERSONS WITH STRONG NERVES WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND A CERTAIN REFINEMENT OF ENJOYMENT THOUGH IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
HE SMILED INNOCENTLY AT A TALL BRILLIANT GIRL WHOSE EYES MET HIS ACCIDENTALLY AND WENT OUT UNCONSCIOUS OF THE GLANCES FOLLOWING HIM ACROSS THE ROOM
THOUGH WE SCARCELY BELIEVE IN IT OURSELVES AS A RULE NO THEY ARE NONPLUSSED IN ALL SINCERITY THE WALL HAS FOR THEM SOMETHING TRANQUILLISING MORALLY SOOTHING FINAL MAYBE EVEN SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS BUT OF THE WALL LATER
I AM NOT DISPUTING THAT BUT PERHAPS THE NORMAL MAN SHOULD BE STUPID HOW DO YOU KNOW PERHAPS IT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL IN FACT AND I AM THE MORE PERSUADED OF THAT SUSPICION IF ONE CAN CALL IT SO BY THE FACT THAT IF YOU TAKE FOR INSTANCE
LEFT ALONE WITH HER ON THE PRIVATE SIDE OF THE SCREEN SEEMED TO BE REARRANGING HER MENTAL IMPRESSIONS BEHIND HER THOUGHTFUL IMMOBILITY OF A HANDSOME OLD FACE MEN WITH GREY MOUSTACHES AND FULL HEALTHY VAGUELY SMILING COUNTENANCES APPROACHED
AND WHAT IS MORE THAT FROM ILL BRED AFFECTATION I AM CLANKING A SWORD LIKE MY OFFICER BUT GENTLEMEN WHOEVER CAN PRIDE HIMSELF ON HIS DISEASES AND EVEN SWAGGER OVER THEM THOUGH AFTER ALL EVERYONE DOES DO THAT
I AM WELL EDUCATED ENOUGH NOT TO BE SUPERSTITIOUS BUT I AM SUPERSTITIOUS NO I REFUSE TO CONSULT A DOCTOR FROM SPITE THAT YOU PROBABLY WILL NOT UNDERSTAND WELL I UNDERSTAND IT THOUGH OF COURSE
I WAS CONSCIOUS EVERY MOMENT IN MYSELF OF MANY VERY MANY ELEMENTS ABSOLUTELY OPPOSITE TO THAT I FELT THEM POSITIVELY SWARMING IN ME THESE OPPOSITE ELEMENTS I KNEW THAT THEY HAD BEEN SWARMING IN ME ALL MY LIFE AND CRAVING SOME OUTLET FROM ME
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF POLICE BEHELD THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE FILLING A PRIVILEGED ARM CHAIR WITHIN THE SCREEN HE SAT THERE BY THE HEAD OF THE OLD LADY'S COUCH MILD VOICED AND QUIET WITH NO MORE SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THAN A VERY SMALL CHILD
I WAS ASHAMED EVEN NOW PERHAPS I AM ASHAMED I GOT TO THE POINT OF FEELING A SORT OF SECRET ABNORMAL DESPICABLE ENJOYMENT IN RETURNING HOME TO MY CORNER ON SOME DISGUSTING PETERSBURG NIGHT
THE INTERRUPTED CONVERSATIONS WERE RESUMED IN THEIR PROPER TONE GRAVE OR LIGHT ONLY A WELL SET UP LONG LIMBED ACTIVE LOOKING MAN OF FORTY TALKING WITH TWO LADIES NEAR A WINDOW REMARKED ALOUD
WELL SUCH A DIRECT PERSON I REGARD AS THE REAL NORMAL MAN AS HIS TENDER MOTHER NATURE WISHED TO SEE HIM WHEN SHE GRACIOUSLY BROUGHT HIM INTO BEING ON THE EARTH I ENVY SUCH A MAN TILL I AM GREEN IN THE FACE HE IS STUPID
PEOPLE DO PRIDE THEMSELVES ON THEIR DISEASES AND I DO MAY BE MORE THAN ANYONE WE WILL NOT DISPUTE IT MY CONTENTION WAS ABSURD BUT YET I AM FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT A GREAT DEAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS
IN THE FIRST PLACE TO BLAME BECAUSE I AM CLEVERER THAN ANY OF THE PEOPLE SURROUNDING ME I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF CLEVERER THAN ANY OF THE PEOPLE SURROUNDING ME AND SOMETIMES WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY ASHAMED OF IT AT ANY RATE
PROMPTLY BECOMES ABSORBED IN COLD MALIGNANT AND ABOVE ALL EVERLASTING SPITE FOR FORTY YEARS TOGETHER IT WILL REMEMBER ITS INJURY DOWN TO THE SMALLEST MOST IGNOMINIOUS DETAILS AND EVERY TIME WILL ADD OF ITSELF
THAT ONE IS NOT TO BLAME IN BEING A SCOUNDREL AS THOUGH THAT WERE ANY CONSOLATION TO THE SCOUNDREL ONCE HE HAS COME TO REALISE THAT HE ACTUALLY IS A SCOUNDREL BUT ENOUGH ECH I HAVE TALKED A LOT OF NONSENSE BUT WHAT HAVE I EXPLAINED
I COULD NOT HAVE REVENGED MYSELF ON ANY ONE FOR ANYTHING BECAUSE I SHOULD CERTAINLY NEVER HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO DO ANYTHING EVEN IF I HAD BEEN ABLE TO WHY SHOULD I NOT HAVE MADE UP MY MIND
AND THEY KEPT HIM SHUT UP FOR TWENTY YEARS ONE SHUDDERS AT THE STUPIDITY OF IT AND NOW THEY HAVE LET HIM OUT EVERYBODY BELONGING TO HIM IS GONE AWAY SOMEWHERE OR DEAD HIS PARENTS ARE DEAD THE GIRL HE WAS TO MARRY HAS DIED WHILE HE WAS IN PRISON
IT WAS AS THOUGH IT WERE MY MOST NORMAL CONDITION AND NOT IN THE LEAST DISEASE OR DEPRAVITY SO THAT AT LAST ALL DESIRE IN ME TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS DEPRAVITY PASSED IT ENDED BY MY ALMOST BELIEVING PERHAPS ACTUALLY BELIEVING
BECAUSE PERHAPS IN REALITY THERE WAS NOTHING FOR YOU TO CHANGE INTO AND THE WORST OF IT WAS AND THE ROOT OF IT ALL THAT IT WAS ALL IN ACCORD WITH THE NORMAL FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF OVER ACUTE CONSCIOUSNESS
THEY LOWERED THEIR SPEARS AND SUFFERED HIM TO ENTER AND HE PASSED WHIRRING THROUGH THE EARTHWARD GATEWAY EVEN SO HE CAME AS FORETOLD TO THE CITY OF NEVER PERCHED UPON TOLDENARBA
THE HIPPOGRIFF SHIED FRANTICALLY AND NEITHER THE MAGIC HALTER NOR ANYTHING THAT HE DID COULD MAKE THE MONSTER FACE IT AT LAST FROM THE CITY OF NEVER'S LONELY OUTSKIRTS WHERE NO INHABITANTS WALKED
FIRST OF ALL NUTH WANTED TO SEE A BUSINESS REFERENCE AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN ONE FROM A JEWELLER WITH WHOM HE HAPPENED TO BE HAND IN GLOVE THE UPSHOT OF IT WAS THAT HE AGREED TO TAKE YOUNG TONKER FOR THIS WAS THE SURNAME OF THE LIKELY LAD
AND WITHOUT ONE WINDOW AT ALL FACING IN THAT DIRECTION THEY DID NOT SPEAK OF IT THERE AND ELSEWHERE IT IS UNHEARD OF INTO THIS WOOD STEPPED NUTH AND TOMMY TONKER THEY HAD NO FIREARMS
AND ALWAYS THE OLD COMPANION THE GLORIOUS WIND KINGDOM BY KINGDOM SLIPT BY AND STILL HIS BREATH WAS EVEN IT IS A GOLDEN THING TO GALLOP ON GOOD TURF IN ONE'S YOUTH SAID THE YOUNG MAN HORSE THE CENTAUR
THE ORB WAS GREY BUT IT GLITTERED LIGHTS BLINKED SURPRISINGLY IN EARLY WINDOWS FORTH OVER WET DIM FIELDS WENT COWS FROM THEIR HOUSES EVEN IN THIS HOUR TOUCHED THE FIELDS AGAIN THE FEET OF THE HIPPOGRIFF
WHEN THERE APPEARED FAR UP IN THE DEEPS OF THE NIGHT TWO LITTLE SAFFRON SPECKS THEN FOUR AND FIVE IT WAS THE HIPPOGRIFFS DANCING AND TWIRLING AROUND IN THE SUN ANOTHER FLOCK JOINED THEM THERE WERE TWELVE OF THEM NOW
AND THERE WERE NONE THAT DID NOT FEAR STRANGE WARS WHEN THEY SAW SHEPPERALK SWERVE AND LEAP ALONG THE PUBLIC WAYS SO HE PASSED FROM CITY TO CITY BY NIGHT HE LAY DOWN UNPANTING IN THE REEDS OF SOME MARSH OR A FOREST
AND PASSING AWAY MOURNING CATASTROPHES IN OTHER WORLDS AND THEY BUILT TEMPLES SOMETIMES TO RUINED STARS THAT HAD FALLEN FLAMING DOWN FROM THE MILKY WAY GIVING THEM WORSHIP STILL WHEN BY US LONG SINCE FORGOTTEN
HISTORY DOES NOT KNOW THEM BUT WHAT OF THAT NOT ALL OF US HAVE SAT AT HISTORIANS FEET BUT ALL HAVE LEARNED FABLE AND MYTH AT THEIR MOTHERS KNEES
INSTRUCTED BY MISTER NUTH WHO WAITED OUTSIDE CAME AWAY WITH ONE POCKETFUL OF RINGS AND SHIRT STUDS IT WAS QUITE A LIGHT POCKETFUL BUT THE JEWELLERS IN PARIS COULD NOT MATCH IT WITHOUT SENDING SPECIALLY TO AFRICA
AND BUY A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY THEN HE DESCENDED SOFTLY AND BECKONED TO NUTH BUT THE GNOLES HAD WATCHED HIM THROUGH KNAVISH HOLES THAT THEY BORE IN TRUNKS OF THE TREES
SO THAT LORD CASTLENORMAN HAD TO BORROW BONE SHIRT STUDS NOT EVEN RUMOUR WHISPERED THE NAME OF NUTH WERE I TO SAY THAT THIS TURNED HIS HEAD THERE ARE THOSE TO WHOM THE ASSERTION WOULD GIVE PAIN
REVELLING UP IN THE SKY BUT WHEN PIGEONS STIRRED ON THE BRANCHES AND THE FIRST SMALL BIRD WAS ABROAD AND LITTLE COOTS FROM THE RUSHES VENTURED TO PEER ABOUT
AND IN THE END ONE WINDY OCTOBER MORNING WITH A MENACE IN THE AIR FOUND HIM AND NUTH DRAWING NEAR TO THE DREADFUL WOOD NUTH BY WEIGHING LITTLE EMERALDS AGAINST PIECES OF COMMON ROCK HAD ASCERTAINED THE PROBABLE WEIGHT OF THOSE HOUSE ORNAMENTS
AND LEAPING FROM CRAG TO CRAG HE GALLOPED BY VALLEY AND CHASM BY TORRENT BED AND SCAR OF AVALANCHE UNTIL HE CAME TO THE WANDERING LEAGUES OF THE PLAIN AND LEFT BEHIND HIM FOR EVER
IT HAD BEEN PROPHECIED THAT HE SHOULD COME THERE THEY KNEW IT WHEN THE PEBBLES WERE BEING MADE AND BEFORE THE ISLES OF CORAL WERE GIVEN UNTO THE SEA AND THUS THE PROPHECY CAME UNTO FULFILMENT AND PASSED INTO HISTORY
AND SO AT LENGTH TO OBLIVION OUT OF WHICH I DRAG IT AS IT GOES FLOATING BY INTO WHICH I SHALL ONE DAY TUMBLE THE HIPPOGRIFFS DANCE BEFORE DAWN IN THE UPPER AIR LONG BEFORE SUNRISE FLASHES UPON OUR LAWNS
THESE MOULDERING CHAIRS THESE FULL LENGTH ANCESTORS AND CARVED MAHOGANY ARE THE PRODUCE OF THE INCOMPARABLE NUTH IT MAY BE URGED AGAINST MY USE OF THE WORD INCOMPARABLE THAT IN THE BURGLARY BUSINESS THE NAME OF SLITH
THAT OVERPEER THE EDGES OF THE WORLD AND SEEM TO DANCE WITH DIGNITY AND CALM IN THAT GENTLE LIGHT OF EVENING THAT IS WONDER'S NATIVE HAUNT THEN DOES THE CITY OF NEVER UNVISITED AND AFAR LOOK LONG AT HER SISTER THE WORLD
TO THE OLD GREEN CASEMENT AND THE MOMENT THAT TONKER TOUCHED THE WITHERED BOARDS THE SILENCE THAT THOUGH OMINOUS WAS EARTHLY BECAME UNEARTHLY LIKE THE TOUCH OF A GHOUL AND TONKER HEARD HIS BREATH OFFENDING AGAINST THAT SILENCE
TONKER HAD ASKED FOR A PISTOL BUT NUTH REPLIED THAT THE SOUND OF A SHOT WOULD BRING EVERYTHING DOWN ON US AND NO MORE WAS SAID ABOUT IT INTO THE WOOD THEY WENT ALL DAY DEEPER AND DEEPER
PACE CAME TO HIM LIKE A MAIDEN WITH A LAMP A NEW AND BEAUTIFUL WONDER THE WIND LAUGHED AS IT PASSED HIM HE PUT HIS HEAD DOWN LOW TO THE SCENT OF THE FLOWERS HE LIFTED IT UP TO BE NEARER THE UNSEEN STARS
THE RIDER TURNED SLOWLY EARTHWARD HE KNEW NOW WHY ALL THE WINDOWS FACED THIS WAY THE DENIZENS OF THE TWILIGHT GAZED AT THE WORLD AND NOT AT A GREATER THAN THEM THEN FROM THE LAST STEP OF THE EARTHWARD STAIRWAY
WITH COBBLED AGATES WERE ITS STREETS A GLORY THROUGH SMALL SQUARE PANES OF ROSE QUARTZ THE CITIZENS LOOKED FROM THEIR HOUSES TO THEM AS THEY LOOKED ABROAD THE WORLD FAR OFF SEEMED HAPPY
HAD HAMMERED FROM MOUNTAIN GOLD AND SET WITH OPALS BARTERED FROM THE GNOMES HE PUT IT UPON HIS WRIST AND SAID NO WORD BUT WALKED FROM HIS MOTHER'S CAVERN AND HE TOOK WITH HIM TOO THAT CLARION OF THE CENTAURS
I KNOW I DO TEACHING THOSE TIRESOME CHILDREN NEARLY ALL DAY WHEN I'M LONGING TO ENJOY MYSELF AT HOME BEGAN MEG IN THE COMPLAINING TONE AGAIN YOU DON'T HAVE HALF SUCH A HARD TIME AS I DO SAID JO
BUT AFTER HE HAD CALLED SAID SOMETHING FUNNY OR KIND TO EACH ONE OF THE GIRLS AND TALKED OVER OLD TIMES WITH THEIR MOTHER NOBODY FELT MUCH AFRAID OF HIM EXCEPT TIMID BETH THE OTHER LION WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE POOR AND LAURIE RICH FOR THIS MADE THEM SHY OF ACCEPTING FAVORS WHICH THEY COULD NOT RETURN
LOOK UNDER YOUR PILLOWS CHRISTMAS MORNING AND YOU WILL FIND YOUR GUIDEBOOK REPLIED MISSUS MARCH THEY TALKED OVER THE NEW PLAN WHILE OLD HANNAH CLEARED THE TABLE THEN OUT CAME THE FOUR LITTLE WORK BASKETS AND THE NEEDLES FLEW AS THE GIRLS MADE SHEETS FOR AUNT MARCH
THE OLD GENTLEMAN SOFTLY STROKED THE HAIR OFF HER FOREHEAD AND STOOPING DOWN HE KISSED HER SAYING IN A TONE FEW PEOPLE EVER HEARD I HAD A LITTLE GIRL ONCE WITH EYES LIKE THESE GOD BLESS YOU MY DEAR GOOD DAY MADAM
HE SAID TO MISSUS MARCH THE BOY NEGLECTS HIS MUSIC NOW AND I'M GLAD OF IT FOR HE WAS GETTING TOO FOND OF IT BUT THE PIANO SUFFERS FOR WANT OF USE
AFTER MANY SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS WITH MEG AND JO THE PATTERN WAS CHOSEN THE MATERIALS BOUGHT AND THE SLIPPERS BEGUN
BUT SHE GOT NO FURTHER FOR JO QUENCHED HER BY SLAMMING DOWN THE WINDOW
I CAN'T GET OVER MY DISAPPOINTMENT IN NOT BEING A BOY AND IT'S WORSE THAN EVER NOW FOR I'M DYING TO GO AND FIGHT WITH PAPA AND I CAN ONLY STAY HOME AND KNIT LIKE A POKY OLD WOMAN AND JO SHOOK THE BLUE ARMY SOCK TILL THE NEEDLES RATTLED LIKE CASTANETS AND HER BALL BOUNDED ACROSS THE ROOM POOR JO
NEXT DAY HAVING SEEN BOTH THE OLD AND YOUNG GENTLEMAN OUT OF THE HOUSE BETH AFTER TWO OR THREE RETREATS FAIRLY GOT IN AT THE SIDE DOOR AND MADE HER WAY AS NOISELESSLY AS ANY MOUSE TO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE HER IDOL STOOD
IT WAS UNINTERESTING SEWING BUT TONIGHT NO ONE GRUMBLED THEY ADOPTED JO'S PLAN OF DIVIDING THE LONG SEAMS INTO FOUR PARTS AND CALLING THE QUARTERS EUROPE ASIA AFRICA AND AMERICA AND
SHE WAS NOT ELEGANTLY DRESSED BUT A NOBLE LOOKING WOMAN AND THE GIRLS THOUGHT THE GRAY CLOAK AND UNFASHIONABLE BONNET COVERED THE MOST SPLENDID MOTHER IN THE WORLD WELL DEARIES HOW HAVE YOU GOT ON TODAY
AND IF THEY DON'T CARE TO COME WHY NEVER MIND HERE A LITTLE HAND SLIPPED INTO HIS AND BETH LOOKED UP
IF I WASN'T TOO OLD FOR SUCH THINGS I'D RATHER LIKE TO PLAY IT OVER AGAIN SAID AMY WHO BEGAN TO TALK OF RENOUNCING CHILDISH THINGS AT THE MATURE AGE OF TWELVE WE NEVER ARE TOO OLD FOR THIS MY DEAR BECAUSE IT IS A PLAY WE ARE PLAYING ALL THE TIME IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
SAID BETH WHO WAS TOASTING HER FACE AND THE BREAD FOR TEA AT THE SAME TIME LET MARMEE THINK WE ARE GETTING THINGS FOR OURSELVES AND THEN SURPRISE HER WE MUST GO SHOPPING TOMORROW AFTERNOON MEG THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO ABOUT THE PLAY FOR CHRISTMAS NIGHT
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE SHUT UP FOR HOURS WITH A NERVOUS FUSSY OLD LADY WHO KEEPS YOU TROTTING IS NEVER SATISFIED AND WORRIES YOU TILL YOU'RE READY TO FLY OUT THE WINDOW OR CRY IT'S NAUGHTY TO FRET BUT I DO THINK WASHING DISHES AND KEEPING THINGS TIDY IS THE WORST WORK IN THE WORLD
AND THE SERVANTS ARE NEVER NEAR THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER NINE O'CLOCK HERE HE ROSE AS IF GOING AND BETH MADE UP HER MIND TO SPEAK FOR THAT LAST ARRANGEMENT LEFT NOTHING TO BE DESIRED
SAID BETH CONTENTEDLY FROM HER CORNER THE FOUR YOUNG FACES ON WHICH THE FIRELIGHT SHONE BRIGHTENED AT THE CHEERFUL WORDS BUT DARKENED AGAIN AS JO SAID SADLY WE HAVEN'T GOT FATHER AND SHALL NOT HAVE HIM FOR A LONG TIME
I RATHER THINK SHE HASN'T GOT ANY SAID HER MOTHER YES I HAVE MINE IS DISHES AND DUSTERS AND ENVYING GIRLS WITH NICE PIANOS AND BEING AFRAID OF PEOPLE BETH'S BUNDLE WAS SUCH A FUNNY ONE THAT EVERYBODY WANTED TO LAUGH BUT NOBODY DID FOR IT WOULD HAVE HURT HER FEELINGS VERY MUCH
AND I SHALL PROVIDE THE SLIPPERS FOR HE TOLD ME TO TAKE SPECIAL CARE OF MOTHER WHILE HE WAS GONE
AND SHE RAN AWAY DECLARING SHE WOULD NEVER GO THERE ANY MORE NOT EVEN FOR THE DEAR PIANO NO PERSUASIONS OR ENTICEMENTS COULD OVERCOME HER FEAR TILL THE FACT COMING TO MISTER LAURENCE'S EAR IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY HE SET ABOUT MENDING MATTERS
AMY FOLLOWED BUT SHE POKED HER HANDS OUT STIFFLY BEFORE HER AND JERKED HERSELF ALONG AS IF SHE WENT BY MACHINERY AND HER OW WAS MORE SUGGESTIVE OF PINS BEING RUN INTO HER THAN OF FEAR AND ANGUISH
IT MAKES ME CROSS AND MY HANDS GET SO STIFF I CAN'T PRACTICE WELL AT ALL AND BETH LOOKED AT HER ROUGH HANDS WITH A SIGH THAT ANY ONE COULD HEAR THAT TIME I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF YOU SUFFER AS I DO CRIED AMY
WE CAN'T DO MUCH BUT WE CAN MAKE OUR LITTLE SACRIFICES AND OUGHT TO DO IT GLADLY BUT I AM AFRAID I DON'T AND MEG SHOOK HER HEAD AS SHE THOUGHT REGRETFULLY OF ALL THE PRETTY THINGS SHE WANTED
I LOVE IT DEARLY AND I'LL COME IF YOU ARE QUITE SURE NOBODY WILL HEAR ME AND BE DISTURBED SHE ADDED FEARING TO BE RUDE AND TREMBLING AT HER OWN BOLDNESS AS SHE SPOKE NOT A SOUL MY DEAR THE HOUSE IS EMPTY HALF THE DAY
BRIGHTENED TO WELCOME HER MEG STOPPED LECTURING AND LIGHTED THE LAMP AMY GOT OUT OF THE EASY CHAIR WITHOUT BEING ASKED AND JO FORGOT HOW TIRED SHE WAS AS SHE SAT UP TO HOLD THE SLIPPERS NEARER TO THE BLAZE THEY ARE QUITE WORN OUT MARMEE MUST HAVE A NEW PAIR
LET US DO IT SAID MEG THOUGHTFULLY IT IS ONLY ANOTHER NAME FOR TRYING TO BE GOOD AND THE STORY MAY HELP US
YOU WON'T STOP I KNOW AS LONG AS YOU CAN TRAIL ROUND IN A WHITE GOWN WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN AND WEAR GOLD PAPER JEWELRY YOU ARE THE BEST ACTRESS WE'VE GOT AND THERE'LL BE AN END OF EVERYTHING IF YOU QUIT THE BOARDS SAID JO WE OUGHT TO REHEARSE TONIGHT
IN HER EARNEST YET TIMID WAY OH SIR THEY DO CARE VERY VERY MUCH ARE YOU THE MUSICAL GIRL HE ASKED WITHOUT ANY STARTLING HEY AS HE LOOKED DOWN AT HER VERY KINDLY I'M BETH
OUR BURDENS ARE HERE OUR ROAD IS BEFORE US AND THE LONGING FOR GOODNESS AND HAPPINESS IS THE GUIDE THAT LEADS US THROUGH MANY TROUBLES AND MISTAKES TO THE PEACE WHICH IS A TRUE CELESTIAL CITY NOW MY LITTLE PILGRIMS SUPPOSE YOU BEGIN AGAIN
IF JO IS A TOMBOY AND AMY A GOOSE WHAT AM I PLEASE ASKED BETH READY TO SHARE THE LECTURE YOU'RE A DEAR AND NOTHING ELSE ANSWERED MEG WARMLY AND NO ONE CONTRADICTED HER FOR THE MOUSE WAS THE PET OF THE FAMILY
ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE SECOND DAY SHE WENT OUT TO DO AN ERRAND AND GIVE POOR JOANNA THE INVALID DOLL HER DAILY EXERCISE AS SHE CAME UP THE STREET ON HER RETURN SHE SAW THREE YES FOUR HEADS POPPING IN AND OUT OF THE PARLOR WINDOWS
DEAR ME HOW HAPPY AND GOOD WE'D BE IF WE HAD NO WORRIES SAID MEG WHO COULD REMEMBER BETTER TIMES
HIS FEUDS WITH PARASITES HIS HORROR OF FROSTS HIS ANXIETY WHEN THE BUDS COME SLOWLY HIS RAPTURE WHEN THE LEAVES ATTAIN THEIR LUSTRE IN THE EAST THE ART OF FLORICULTURE IS A VERY ANCIENT ONE
HE SINGS ONLY OF HIMSELF HIS WORKS MAY BE NEARER SCIENCE BUT ARE FURTHER FROM HUMANITY WE HAVE AN OLD SAYING IN JAPAN THAT A WOMAN CANNOT LOVE A MAN WHO IS TRULY VAIN FOR THEIR IS NO CREVICE IN HIS HEART FOR LOVE TO ENTER AND FILL UP
THE POWER OF TRADITION AND CONVENTIONALITY AS WELL AS OUR HEREDITARY INSTINCTS RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF OUR CAPACITY FOR ARTISTIC ENJOYMENT OUR VERY INDIVIDUALITY ESTABLISHES IN ONE SENSE A LIMIT TO OUR UNDERSTANDING
WHAT SOLACE DO THEY NOT BRING TO THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WHAT A LIGHT OF BLISS TO THE DARKNESS OF WEARY SPIRITS THEIR SERENE TENDERNESS RESTORES TO US OUR WANING CONFIDENCE IN THE UNIVERSE EVEN AS THE INTENT GAZE OF A BEAUTIFUL CHILD RECALLS OUR LOST HOPES
HE ENTERED THE REALM OF ART WHEN HE PERCEIVED THE SUBTLE USE OF THE USELESS IN JOY OR SADNESS FLOWERS ARE OUR CONSTANT FRIENDS WE EAT DRINK SING DANCE AND FLIRT WITH THEM WE WED AND CHRISTEN WITH FLOWERS WE DARE NOT DIE WITHOUT THEM
WITH THE PERFECTING OF THE TEA RITUAL UNDER RIKIU IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY FLOWER ARRANGEMENT ALSO ATTAINS ITS FULL GROWTH RIKIU AND HIS SUCCESSORS
WE HAVE WORSHIPPED WITH THE LILY WE HAVE MEDITATED WITH THE LOTUS WE HAVE CHARGED IN BATTLE ARRAY WITH THE ROSE AND THE CHRYSANTHEMUM WE HAVE EVEN ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK IN THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS HOW COULD WE LIVE WITHOUT THEM IT FRIGHTENS ONE TO CONCEIVE OF A WORLD BEREFT OF THEIR PRESENCE
ARE CONSTANTLY IN A STATE OF MISERY WHILE VAINLY TRYING TO APPEAR HAPPY AND CONTENTED WE STAGGER IN THE ATTEMPT TO KEEP OUR MORAL EQUILIBRIUM AND SEE FORERUNNERS OF THE TEMPEST IN EVERY CLOUD THAT FLOATS ON THE HORIZON
IN FACT THROUGH THEIR TEACHINGS TEA HAS ENTERED THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE
THE SILKEN WRAPPING WITHIN WHOSE SOFT FOLDS LAY THE HOLY OF HOLIES RARELY WAS THE OBJECT EXPOSED TO VIEW AND THEN ONLY TO THE INITIATED
THE BIRTH OF THE ART OF FLOWER ARRANGEMENT SEEMS TO BE SIMULTANEOUS WITH THAT OF TEAISM IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY OUR LEGENDS ASCRIBE THE FIRST FLOWER ARRANGEMENT TO THOSE EARLY BUDDHIST SAINTS WHO GATHERED THE FLOWERS STREWN BY THE STORM
IT WOULD BE HIS BOAST THAT HE COULD KEEP LIFE WITHIN YOU FOR TWO OR MORE WEEKS LONGER THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT HIS TREATMENT WOULD YOU NOT HAVE PREFERRED TO HAVE BEEN KILLED AT ONCE WHEN YOU WERE FIRST CAPTURED
THAT THEY ALWAYS ASSOCIATE THE LEAVES IF THERE BE ANY
SHE MAY SAY HOW LOVELY YOU ARE WHILE HER FINGERS ARE STILL MOIST WITH YOUR BLOOD TELL ME WILL THIS BE KINDNESS IT MAY BE YOUR FATE TO BE IMPRISONED IN THE HAIR OF ONE WHOM YOU KNOW TO BE HEARTLESS OR TO BE THRUST INTO THE BUTTONHOLE OF ONE
HAVE YOU HEARD THE TAOIST TALE OF THE TAMING OF THE HARP ONCE IN THE HOARY AGES IN THE RAVINE OF LUNGMEN STOOD A KIRI TREE A VERITABLE KING OF THE FOREST IT REARED ITS HEAD TO TALK TO THE STARS ITS ROOTS STRUCK DEEP INTO THE EARTH
ONCE MORE THE SWEET BREATH OF SPRING PLAYED AMIDST ITS BRANCHES THE YOUNG CATARACTS AS THEY DANCED DOWN THE RAVINE LAUGHED TO THE BUDDING FLOWERS ANON WERE HEARD THE DREAMY VOICES OF SUMMER WITH ITS MYRIAD INSECTS THE GENTLE PATTERING OF RAIN
ONE IS REMINDED IN THIS CONNECTION OF A STORY CONCERNING KOBORI ENSHIU ENSHIU WAS COMPLIMENTED BY HIS DISCIPLES ON THE ADMIRABLE TASTE HE HAD DISPLAYED IN THE CHOICE OF HIS COLLECTION SAID THEY
HAVE YOU NOT NOTICED THAT THE WILD FLOWERS ARE BECOMING SCARCER EVERY YEAR IT MAY BE THAT THEIR WISE MEN HAVE TOLD THEM TO DEPART TILL MAN BECOMES MORE HUMAN PERHAPS THEY HAVE MIGRATED TO HEAVEN
THEY ARE NOT COWARDS LIKE MEN SOME FLOWERS GLORY IN DEATH CERTAINLY THE JAPANESE CHERRY BLOSSOMS DO AS THEY FREELY SURRENDER THEMSELVES TO THE WINDS ANYONE WHO HAS STOOD BEFORE THE FRAGRANT AVALANCHE AT YOSHINO OR ARASHIYAMA MUST HAVE REALIZED THIS
AND THE MONASTERY OF KOHOAN ALL THE CELEBRATED GARDENS OF JAPAN WERE LAID OUT BY THE TEA MASTERS OUR POTTERY WOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE ATTAINED ITS HIGH QUALITY OF EXCELLENCE
THE MYSTIC FIRE CONSUMES OUR WEAKNESS THE SACRED SWORD CLEAVES THE BONDAGE OF DESIRE FROM OUR ASHES SPRINGS THE PHOENIX OF CELESTIAL HOPE OUT OF THE FREEDOM COMES A HIGHER REALISATION OF MANHOOD
AND THUS OFTEN MISS THE RICH REPAST OF BEAUTY SPREAD BEFORE OUR VERY EYES A MASTER HAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO OFFER WHILE WE GO HUNGRY SOLELY BECAUSE OF OUR OWN LACK OF APPRECIATION
WHO ON A FREEZING NIGHT IN LACK OF FUEL FOR A FIRE CUTS HIS CHERISHED PLANTS IN ORDER TO ENTERTAIN A WANDERING FRIAR
EVEN THE PALACES AND MONASTERIES BUILT AFTER THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY HAVE ALL BEEN SUBJECT THE MANY SIDED KOBORI ENSHIU HAS LEFT NOTABLE EXAMPLES OF HIS GENIUS IN THE IMPERIAL VILLA OF KATSURA
SUDDENLY TAKES FIRE THROUGH THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE SAMURAI IN CHARGE RESOLVED AT ALL HAZARDS TO RESCUE THE PRECIOUS PAINTING HE RUSHES INTO THE BURNING BUILDING AND SEIZES THE KAKEMONO ONLY TO FIND ALL MEANS OF EXIT CUT OFF BY THE FLAMES
HAS MOREOVER CREATED IN US THE HABIT OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE SPECIES A COLLECTOR IS ANXIOUS TO ACQUIRE SPECIMENS TO ILLUSTRATE A PERIOD OR A SCHOOL
STRUGGLING ARTISTS WEARY SOULS LINGERING IN THE SHADOW OF COLD DISDAIN IN OUR SELF CENTERED CENTURY WHAT INSPIRATION DO WE OFFER THEM THE PAST MAY WELL LOOK WITH PITY AT THE POVERTY OF OUR CIVILISATION
IT IS TO BE DEPLORED THAT SO FEW OF US REALLY TAKE PAINS TO STUDY THE MOODS OF THE MASTERS IN OUR STUBBORN IGNORANCE WE REFUSE TO RENDER THEM THIS SIMPLE COURTESY
DIE DIE DIE DIE DEATH COMES TO ALL DESTRUCTION FACES US WHEREVER WE TURN DESTRUCTION BELOW AND ABOVE DESTRUCTION BEHIND AND BEFORE CHANGE IS THE ONLY ETERNAL
I SPRANG FOR HIS HAND BUT SAW THAT I WAS TOO LATE AND JUMPED ASIDE AT THE SAME INSTANT HE FIRED AND THE BULLET WHICH WOULD HAVE STRUCK ME PASSED THROUGH THE HEART OF MY UNFORTUNATE BROTHER
HIS NAME WAS JOHN PALMER THE STATION CLOCK WAS UPON THE STROKE OF FIVE AND THE GUARD WAS ABOUT TO GIVE THE CUSTOMARY SIGNAL TO THE ENGINE DRIVER WHEN HE OBSERVED TWO BELATED PASSENGERS HURRYING DOWN THE PLATFORM THE ONE WAS
AS IT CAME UP TO HIM AND THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE INCIDENT TWELVE MINUTES AFTER ITS DEPARTURE THE TRAIN REACHED WILLESDEN JUNCTION WHERE IT STOPPED FOR A VERY SHORT INTERVAL AN EXAMINATION OF THE TICKETS HAS MADE IT CERTAIN
AS WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO THE THREE PEOPLE WHO HAD STARTED AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE FROM WILLESDEN IN THOSE TWO COMPARTMENTS I HAVE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO PERSONAL PROPERTY WHICH MIGHT HELP TO IDENTIFY HIM
IF OUR SUPPOSITION OF INCIPIENT MANIA IS CORRECT THE YOUNG MAN IS LIKELY TO HAVE ASSAULTED THE OTHER AS THE UPSHOT OF THE QUARREL THE ELDER MAN SHOT THE INTRUDER AND THEN MADE HIS ESCAPE FROM THE CARRIAGE
ALSO THAT I COULD DO NOTHING AGAINST MAC COY WHICH WOULD NOT RECOIL UPON MY MOTHER AND MYSELF HOW COULD WE CONVICT HIM WITHOUT A FULL ACCOUNT OF MY BROTHER'S CAREER BEING MADE PUBLIC THE VERY THING WHICH OF ALL OTHERS WE WISHED TO AVOID
BUT HIS ANGER AGAINST ME AND MY RESENTMENT TOWARDS HIM HAD BOTH FOR THE MOMENT BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN THIS SUDDEN TRAGEDY IT WAS HE WHO FIRST REALIZED THE SITUATION THE TRAIN WAS FOR SOME REASON GOING VERY SLOWLY AT THE MOMENT
THE TWO COMPARTMENTS IN QUESTION WAS UNCOUPLED AND SIDE TRACKED THEN ON THE ARRIVAL OF INSPECTOR VANE OF SCOTLAND YARD AND OF MISTER HENDERSON A DETECTIVE IN THE SERVICE OF THE RAILWAY COMPANY AN EXHAUSTIVE INQUIRY
IT WAS SURMISED BY SOME THAT HE WAS CONCEALED UNDER THE SEAT AND THAT BEING DISCOVERED HE WAS FOR SOME REASON POSSIBLY BECAUSE HE HAD OVERHEARD THEIR GUILTY SECRETS PUT TO DEATH BY HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS
I TRIED TO STOP THE TRAIN SO AS TO FOLLOW THEM BUT THE WHEELS WERE ALREADY MOVING AND IT WAS TOO LATE WHEN WE STOPPED AT WILLESDEN I INSTANTLY CHANGED MY CARRIAGE IT APPEARS THAT I WAS NOT SEEN TO DO SO WHICH IS NOT SURPRISING
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME IF I'M NOT VERY FREE WITH NAMES THERE'S LESS REASON NOW THAN THERE WAS FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN MOTHER WAS STILL LIVING BUT FOR ALL THAT I HAD RATHER COVER UP OUR TRACKS ALL I CAN
COULD GET OUT OF THE TRAIN AND ONE OTHER GET IN DURING THE UNBROKEN RUN BETWEEN WILLESDEN AND RUGBY
AND THEN ONE DAY HE DRESSED HIMSELF AS A GIRL AND HE CARRIED IT OFF SO WELL AND MADE HIMSELF SUCH A VALUABLE DECOY THAT IT WAS THEIR FAVOURITE GAME AFTERWARDS THEY HAD MADE IT RIGHT WITH TAMMANY AND WITH THE POLICE
TO DESCRIBE OR TO IDENTIFY HIM HE WAS A MAN OF THIRTY FOUR OR THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE DRESSED IN SOME GREY MATERIAL SHARP NOSED ALERT WITH A RUDDY WEATHER BEATEN FACE AND A SMALL
NOW THERE IS ONE MOST REMARKABLE AND SUGGESTIVE FACT WHICH HAS NOT MET WITH THE ATTENTION WHICH IT DESERVES THERE IS A LOCAL TRAIN RUNNING THROUGH HARROW AND KING'S LANGLEY WHICH IS TIMED IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE A WOMAN WHOM HE LOVED AND A MAN WHOM HE HATED AND WHO IN RETURN HATED HIM THE YOUNG MAN WAS EXCITABLE AND IMPULSIVE HE OPENED THE DOOR OF HIS CARRIAGE STEPPED FROM THE FOOTBOARD
THE EXPRESS BEING FIVE MINUTES LATE AT RUGBY THE ATTENTION OF THE STATION OFFICIALS WAS DRAWN TO THE FACT THAT THE DOOR OF ONE OF THE FIRST CLASS CARRIAGES WAS OPEN AN EXAMINATION OF THAT COMPARTMENT AND OF ITS NEIGHBOUR
IS A DETAIL WHICH WE HAVE AT PRESENT NO MEANS OF EXPLAINING I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY AT FIRST SIGHT IT MIGHT SEEM IMPROBABLE THAT AT SUCH A MOMENT A MURDERER WOULD BURDEN HIMSELF IN HIS FLIGHT WITH A BROWN LEATHER BAG
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE A MARY JANE OF YOURSELF WHILE I CAN HELP IT IF NOTHING BUT THAT DISGUISE STANDS BETWEEN YOU AND A GAOL THEN TO GAOL YOU SHALL GO THAT WAS THE WAY TO MANAGE HIM I FELT MY ADVANTAGE AT ONCE
AND THAT THIS WAS HIS PLUNDER WAS DISCOUNTED BY THE FACT THAT ALL SIX WERE OF AMERICAN MAKE AND OF A TYPE WHICH IS RARE IN ENGLAND THREE OF THEM BORE THE MARK OF THE ROCHESTER WATCHMAKING COMPANY
THE GUARD TURNED THE HANDLE OF THE NEAREST DOOR IN THE CARRIAGE WHICH HE HAD OPENED THERE SAT A SMALL MAN WITH A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH HIS APPEARANCE SEEMS TO HAVE IMPRESSED ITSELF UPON THE GUARD'S MEMORY FOR HE WAS PREPARED AFTERWARDS
AN EXCEPTIONALLY TALL MAN DRESSED IN A LONG BLACK OVERCOAT WITH ASTRAKHAN COLLAR AND CUFFS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT THE EVENING WAS AN INCLEMENT ONE AND THE TALL TRAVELLER HAD THE HIGH WARM COLLAR
HE GOT OFF INTO NEW YORK AND WENT RAPIDLY FROM BAD TO WORSE AT FIRST HE WAS ONLY FAST AND THEN HE WAS CRIMINAL AND THEN AT THE END OF A YEAR OR TWO HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS YOUNG CROOKS IN THE CITY
ON THE CONTRARY THE PRESS BOTH IN ENGLAND AND IN AMERICA TEEMED WITH SUGGESTIONS AND SUPPOSITIONS MOST OF WHICH WERE OBVIOUSLY ABSURD THE FACT THAT THE WATCHES WERE OF AMERICAN MAKE
HE HAD FORMED A FRIENDSHIP WITH SPARROW MAC COY WHO WAS AT THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION AS A BUNCO STEERER GREEN GOODSMAN AND GENERAL RASCAL THEY TOOK TO CARD SHARPING
MY ANSWER IS THAT HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT IF THE BAG WERE FOUND HIS IDENTITY WOULD BE ESTABLISHED IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR HIM TO TAKE IT WITH HIM MY THEORY STANDS OR FALLS UPON ONE POINT
DEBRAY COULD BUT GIVE HER ADVICE SHE MUST APPLY TO SOME ONE MORE POWERFUL THAN HE
AND HAD GONE TO BED AND TO SLEEP SHE CALLED THE MAID AND QUESTIONED HER MADEMOISELLE EUGENIE SAID THE MAID
WHERE DO YOU COME FROM OH THIS IS TOO MUCH MADAME THESE ARE MY ORDERS EXCUSE ME YOUR NAME THE BARONESS DANGLARS YOU HAVE SEEN ME TWENTY TIMES
PALE AND COLD ADIEU SIR SHE SAID ADIEU MADAME REPLIED THE KING'S ATTORNEY AS IN AN ALMOST JOYFUL MANNER HE CONDUCTED HER TO THE DOOR
YOU WILL EXCUSE THIS POOR FELLOW MADAME
POSSIBLY MADAME AND NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT
AND WHEN IT COMMANDS IT STRIKES YOU WILL TELL ME THAT I AM A LIVING BEING AND NOT A CODE A MAN AND NOT A VOLUME LOOK AT ME MADAME
AND BELIEVED FIRMLY IN HER DAUGHTER'S INNOCENCE AND FIDELITY TO THE PATERNAL ROOF SHE LISTENED AT EUGENIE'S DOOR AND HEARING NO SOUND TRIED TO ENTER BUT THE BOLTS WERE IN PLACE MADAME DANGLARS THEN CONCLUDED THAT THE YOUNG GIRL HAD BEEN OVERCOME WITH THE TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT OF THE EVENING
THE BARONESS BECAME PALE YOU WERE SAYING THIS WERE YOU NOT WELL I OWN IT I WILL ANSWER YOU
HAVE NOT HAPPENED BY NATURAL MEANS I WAS NOT THINKING OF THAT REPLIED MADAME DANGLARS QUICKLY YES YOU WERE THINKING OF IT AND WITH JUSTICE
BUT THIS IS TRAMPLING ON THE WEAK SIR THE WEAKNESS OF A MURDERER HIS DISHONOR REFLECTS UPON US
FOR IN A SOCIETY SUCH AS OURS SATIRE INFLICTS A PAINFUL AND INCURABLE WOUND
THIS IS HIS DESCRIPTION BENEDETTO CONDEMNED AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN FOR FIVE YEARS TO THE GALLEYS FOR FORGERY HE PROMISED WELL AS YOU SEE FIRST A RUNAWAY THEN AN ASSASSIN
HAVE MANKIND TREATED ME AS A BROTHER HAVE THEY LOVED ME HAVE THEY SPARED ME HAS ANY ONE SHOWN THE MERCY TOWARDS ME THAT YOU NOW ASK AT MY HANDS NO MADAME THEY STRUCK ME ALWAYS STRUCK ME
SAID THE BARONESS SPEAK TO ME NOT AS A MAGISTRATE BUT AS A FRIEND AND WHEN I AM IN BITTER ANGUISH OF SPIRIT DO NOT TELL ME THAT I OUGHT TO BE GAY VILLEFORT BOWED WHEN I HEAR MISFORTUNES NAMED MADAME
THE BARONESS RETURNED TO THE HOTEL WITH AS MUCH CAUTION AS EUGENIE USED IN LEAVING IT SHE RAN LIGHTLY UP STAIRS AND WITH AN ACHING HEART ENTERED HER APARTMENT CONTIGUOUS AS WE KNOW TO THAT OF EUGENIE SHE WAS FEARFUL OF EXCITING ANY REMARK
NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS A SOURCE OF DISSENSION AND SCANDAL UNDER THE PATERNAL ROOF BUT BECAUSE SHE HAD AT ONCE CLASSED HIM IN THAT CATALOGUE OF BIPEDS WHOM PLATO ENDEAVORS TO WITHDRAW FROM THE APPELLATION OF MEN
REPLIED VILLEFORT AH EXCLAIMED THE BARONESS WITHOUT EXPRESSING THE IDEAS WHICH THE EXCLAMATION BETRAYED VILLEFORT LOOKED AT HER WITH THAT PIERCING GLANCE WHICH READS THE SECRETS OF THE HEART
VILLEFORT HERE EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARD A LARGE CRUCIFIX PLACED OPPOSITE TO HIS DESK WHEN THEY ARE DISCOVERED I SWEAR TO YOU BY ALL I HOLD MOST SACRED
YOU WHO PURSUE CRIME SO VINDICTIVELY ANSWER NOW
AND HER GLANCE WAS TURNED TOWARDS HEAVEN
MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE WENT TO BED WITHOUT A SHADOW OF SUSPICION AND BEGAN TO MUSE OVER THE RECENT EVENTS IN PROPORTION AS HER MEMORY BECAME CLEARER THE OCCURRENCES OF THE EVENING WERE REVEALED IN THEIR TRUE LIGHT WHAT SHE HAD TAKEN FOR CONFUSION WAS A TUMULT
THIS YOUNG MAN THOUGH A MURDERER IS AN ORPHAN ABANDONED BY EVERYBODY SO MUCH THE WORSE OR RATHER SO MUCH THE BETTER
NOW AFTER THE OATH I HAVE JUST TAKEN AND WHICH I WILL KEEP MADAME DARE YOU ASK FOR MERCY FOR THAT WRETCH BUT SIR ARE YOU SURE HE IS AS GUILTY AS THEY SAY LISTEN
HAS THE LAW A MEMORY FOR ALL THOSE SOFT RECOLLECTIONS YOU ENDEAVOR TO RECALL NO MADAME
THEN RESTING BOTH HANDS UPON HIS DESK HE SAID IN A VOICE MORE HOLLOW THAN USUAL THERE ARE CRIMES WHICH REMAIN UNPUNISHED BECAUSE THE CRIMINALS ARE UNKNOWN
FIVE DAYS ARE MORE THAN I REQUIRE
BUT NO ON REFLECTION THE PROCUREUR WAS NOT A MERCILESS MAN AND IT WAS NOT THE MAGISTRATE SLAVE TO HIS DUTIES BUT THE FRIEND THE LOYAL FRIEND WHO ROUGHLY BUT FIRMLY CUT INTO THE VERY CORE OF THE CORRUPTION
IN THE COURT SHOWING HIS MERCHANDISE WAS A TRADESMAN WHO HAD BEEN ADMITTED WITH THE SAME PRECAUTIONS THE BARONESS ASCENDED THE STEPS SHE FELT HERSELF STRONGLY INFECTED WITH THE SADNESS WHICH SEEMED TO MAGNIFY HER OWN
OR WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THE PROCUREUR WELL I HAVE BUSINESS WITH THE PROCUREUR IS IT PRESSING BUSINESS YOU CAN IMAGINE SO SINCE I HAVE NOT EVEN BROUGHT MY CARRIAGE OUT YET BUT ENOUGH OF THIS HERE IS MY CARD
YOU TOO THEN ARE UNHAPPY SHE SAID YES MADAME REPLIED THE MAGISTRATE THEN YOU PITY ME SINCERELY MADAME AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT BRINGS ME HERE
HE SAID I HAVE WITHIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS CONTRACTED THE BAD HABIT OF THINKING OF MY OWN AND THEN I CANNOT HELP DRAWING UP AN EGOTISTICAL PARALLEL IN MY MIND THAT IS THE REASON THAT BY THE SIDE OF MY MISFORTUNES
FOR IN THE TACIT RELATIONS WHICH MAINTAIN THE BOND OF FAMILY UNION THE MOTHER TO MAINTAIN HER ASCENDANCY OVER HER DAUGHTER MUST NEVER FAIL TO BE A MODEL OF WISDOM AND A TYPE OF PERFECTION NOW
IS NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN AN ASSASSIN SIR I DO NOT DENY THE JUSTICE OF YOUR CORRECTION
I NEVER REST TILL I HAVE TORN THE DISGUISES FROM MY FELLOW CREATURES AND FOUND OUT THEIR WEAKNESSES I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THEM AND MORE I REPEAT IT WITH JOY WITH TRIUMPH I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND SOME PROOF OF HUMAN PERVERSITY OR ERROR
A DRAGOON HAS BROUGHT THIS DESPATCH FROM THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR
THOUGH YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT FOR SHE PETTED HIM AS SHE DID DAISY AND HE THOUGHT HER A VERY DELIGHTFUL WOMAN ONE FAULT OF NAT'S GAVE THE BHAERS MUCH ANXIETY ALTHOUGH THEY SAW HOW IT HAD BEEN STRENGTHENED BY FEAR AND IGNORANCE I REGRET TO SAY THAT NAT SOMETIMES TOLD LIES
THERE WAS MISS NAN TO BE SURE TUGGING ALONG A VERY LARGE BAND BOX TIED UP IN LINEN BAG VERY HOT AND DUSTY AND TIRED DID SHE LOOK
THAT SPOILED HER CLEAN FROCK AND HURT HER LITTLE FEELINGS VERY MUCH HE PUT ROUGH WHITE PEBBLES IN THE SUGAR BOWL WHEN HIS GRANDMOTHER CAME TO TEA
THESE TRAITS MADE HIS PARENTS ANXIOUS TO BALANCE THEM WITH USEFUL KNOWLEDGE AND HEALTHFUL SOCIETY LEST THEY SHOULD MAKE HIM ONE OF THOSE PALE PRECOCIOUS CHILDREN WHO AMAZE AND DELIGHT A FAMILY SOMETIMES AND FADE AWAY LIKE HOT HOUSE FLOWERS
DINNER'S READY LET ME RING THE BELL AND ROB BEGAN A SOLO UPON THAT INSTRUMENT WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR ONE'S SELF SPEAK THEN I MAY HAVE NAN MAY I ASKED MISSUS JO
INDEED THE FAMILY CALLED HIM THE BLUNDERBUSS AND ALWAYS EXPECTED TO SEE HIM TUMBLE OVER THE CHAIRS BUMP AGAINST THE TABLES AND KNOCK DOWN ANY SMALL ARTICLES NEAR HIM HE BRAGGED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT WHAT HE COULD DO BUT SELDOM DID ANY THING TO PROVE IT WAS NOT BRAVE AND A LITTLE GIVEN TO TALE TELLING
AND WHEN HE RECOVERED THE OVERTASKED BRAIN GAVE OUT
HE HOWLS AT EVERY THING ANSWERED JACK SCORNFULLY I DON'T I NEVER CRY NO MATTER HOW I'M HURT IT'S BABYISH SAID NAN LOFTILY POOH I COULD MAKE YOU CRY IN TWO MINUTES RETURNED STUFFY ROUSING UP SEE IF YOU CAN
AND WAS ORDERED TO ASK LEAVE BEFORE DISPOSING OF HER CLOTHES SHE DELIGHTED THE BOYS BY MAKING A FIRE SHIP OUT OF A SHINGLE WITH TWO LARGE SAILS WET WITH TURPENTINE
NO I WANT TO SEE THE BOYS AND THE BARN AND RAN OFF SWINGING HER HAT BY ONE STRING TILL IT BROKE WHEN SHE LEFT IT TO ITS FATE ON THE GRASS HULLO NAN CRIED THE BOYS AS SHE BOUNCED IN AMONG THEM WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT I'M GOING TO STAY
AND HUNG ALL OVER WITH DAISY CHAINS MADE BY HIS LITTLE PLAYMATE WHILE HE LAY ON THE GRASS AND TOLD HER STORIES NO ONE SAID A WORD ABOUT THE SCENE OF THE MORNING BUT ITS EFFECT WAS ALL THE MORE LASTING FOR THAT REASON PERHAPS
ANOTHER HELPFUL THING HAPPENED IN A MOST UNEXPECTED AND AGREEABLE MANNER SEVERAL OF THE BOYS WERE IN BUSINESS AS THEY CALLED IT FOR MOST OF THEM WERE POOR AND KNOWING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN WAY TO MAKE BY AND BY THE BHAERS ENCOURAGED ANY EFFORTS AT INDEPENDENCE TOMMY SOLD HIS EGGS
TROTTED TO TAP AT HIS DOOR WITH A MOTHERLY GET UP MY DEAR IT'S MOST BREAKFAST TIME AND HERE'S YOUR CLEAN COLLAR
WITH TEARS IN HER EYES SO LIKE MY BETH AND GO SOFTLY BY LEST EVEN HER FAMILIAR PRESENCE MAR THE CHILD'S SWEET SATISFACTION NAT WAS VERY FOND OF MISSUS BHAER BUT FOUND SOMETHING EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE IN THE GOOD PROFESSOR WHO TOOK FATHERLY CARE OF THE SHY FEEBLE BOY
TOMMY WAS SO STAGGERED BY THIS LAST SPEECH THAT HE NEARLY TUMBLED DOWN THE BANK BUT SAVED HIMSELF
AND IN MENDING THESE NAT FOUND AN EMPLOYMENT THAT JUST SUITED HIM HE WAS VERY NEAT AND SKILLFUL WITH THOSE SLENDER FINGERS OF HIS AND PASSED MANY A RAINY AFTERNOON WITH HIS GUM BOTTLE PAINT BOX AND KNIFE
BUT IF YOU THINK IT WILL CURE ME I'LL LET YOU SNIP MY TONGUE SAID NAT HEROICALLY FOR HE DREADED PAIN YET DID WISH TO STOP FIBBING MISTER BHAER SMILED BUT SHOOK HIS HEAD
I'M GOING TO WALK WANT TO COME ASKED NAT TRYING TO LOOK AS IF NOTHING WAS THE MATTER YET FEELING VERY GRATEFUL FOR HER SILENT SYMPATHY BECAUSE HE FANCIED EVERYONE MUST LOOK UPON HIM AS A WRETCH OH YES
PRETTY COBWEBS HE WAS SO FOND OF SPINNING IN THAT LITTLE BRAIN OF HIS TO BE SURE HE RATHER SHOCKED HIS MOTHER WHEN HE CAME HOME BY BANGING DOORS SAYING BY GEORGE EMPHATICALLY AND DEMANDING TALL THICK BOOTS THAT CLUMPED LIKE PAPA'S
YES BUT PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME I CAN'T BEAR IT CRIED NAT
FOR THEY ALWAYS FLEW AT THEIR FATHER THE MINUTE SCHOOL WAS DONE AT FIRST PERHAPS BUT IT WILL DO POSY GOOD SHE IS GETTING PRIM AND BETTYISH AND NEEDS STIRRING UP A BIT SHE ALWAYS HAS A GOOD TIME WHEN NAN COMES OVER TO PLAY AND THE TWO WILL HELP EACH OTHER WITHOUT KNOWING IT
I'D RATHER HAVE MY HEAD CUT OFF THAN DO IT NOW
IT WAS A TERRIBLE LESSON TO HIS AMBITIOUS FATHER HE COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF HIS PROMISING CHILD CHANGED TO A FEEBLE IDIOT AND HE SENT HIM AWAY TO PLUMFIELD SCARCELY HOPING THAT HE COULD BE HELPED BUT SURE THAT HE WOULD BE KINDLY TREATED
LITTLE ANNIE HARDING WHAT NAUGHTY NAN AS THE LADS CALL HER CRIED MISTER BHAER LOOKING VERY MUCH AMUSED YES SHE IS RUNNING WILD AT HOME SINCE HER MOTHER DIED AND IS TOO BRIGHT A CHILD TO BE SPOILT BY SERVANTS
I CAN BEAT YOU IN RUNNING ANY WAY RETURNED NAN FALLING BACK ON HER STRONG POINT CAN SHE ASKED NAT OF JACK
IT IS SO MUCH NICER THAN FIDDLING IN THE STREET FOR THEN I GOT NONE OF THE MONEY AND NOW I HAVE IT ALL AND A GOOD TIME BESIDES
AND YOUR AUNT CAME AND CARRIED ME OFF ISN'T IT GREAT FUN WHY YES DID YOU BRING YOUR BIG DOLL ASKED DAISY HOPING SHE HAD FOR ON THE LAST VISIT NAN HAD RAVAGED THE BABY HOUSE AND INSISTED ON WASHING BLANCHE MATILDA'S PLASTER FACE
NEVER WAS A GARDEN MORE FAITHFULLY HOED MISTER BHAER REALLY FEARED THAT NOTHING WOULD FIND TIME TO GROW NAT KEPT UP SUCH A STIRRING OF THE SOIL
AND I COULDN'T GO ON NO SIR
I THINK YOU WILL ASK THE DEAR GOD TO HELP YOU AND TRY TO SPARE US BOTH ANOTHER SCENE LIKE THIS TOMMY SAW NO MORE FOR HE CREPT BACK TO THE HALL LOOKING SO EXCITED AND SOBER THAT THE BOYS CROWDED ROUND HIM TO ASK WHAT WAS BEING DONE TO NAT
ANOTHER TIME YOU MUST WAIT FOR YOU WILL GET INTO TROUBLE IF YOU RUN AWAY
SHE IS FULL OF SPIRITS AND ONLY NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT WHAT TO DO WITH THEM TO BE AS NICE A LITTLE GIRL AS DAISY THOSE QUICK WITS OF HERS WOULD ENJOY LESSONS IF THEY WERE RIGHTLY DIRECTED AND WHAT IS NOW A TRICKSY MIDGET WOULD SOON BECOME A BUSY HAPPY CHILD
FOR HE WENT TO MISTER LAURENCE'S GREAT HOUSE SAW HIS PRETTY WIFE AND LITTLE FAIRY OF A DAUGHTER HAD A GOOD DINNER AND WAS MADE SO COMFORTABLE THAT HE TALKED AND DREAMED OF IT FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS AFTERWARD IT TAKES SO LITTLE TO MAKE A CHILD HAPPY THAT IT IS A PITY
HE DROPPED A HOT CENT DOWN MARY ANN'S BACK AS THAT PRETTY MAID WAS WAITING AT TABLE ONE DAY WHEN THERE WERE GENTLEMEN TO DINNER WHEREAT THE POOR GIRL UPSET THE SOUP AND RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM IN DISMAY LEAVING THE FAMILY TO THINK THAT SHE HAD GONE MAD
AND SHE WAS OFTEN FOUND SITTING ON THE STAIRS OUTSIDE NAT'S DOOR WHILE HE WAS PRACTISING THIS PLEASED HIM VERY MUCH AND HE PLAYED HIS BEST FOR THAT ONE QUIET LITTLE LISTENER FOR SHE NEVER WOULD COME IN BUT PREFERRED TO SIT SEWING HER GAY PATCHWORK OR TENDING ONE OF HER MANY DOLLS WITH AN EXPRESSION OF DREAMY PLEASURE ON HER FACE THAT MADE AUNT JO SAY
YOU WILL HAVE DONE A MAGNIFICENT WORK INTERRUPTED MISTER BHAER
YES SHE'S SOMEWHERE ROUND RETURNED NAN WITH MOST UNMATERNAL CARELESSNESS I MADE YOU A RING COMING ALONG AND PULLED THE HAIRS OUT OF DOBBIN'S TAIL DON'T YOU WANT IT
DE WITT SUCCEEDED AFTER AN ANGRY DEBATE IN SECURING A MAJORITY FOR THE ACT FIVE TOWNS HOWEVER OBSTINATELY REFUSED THEIR ASSENT AND CLAIMED THAT IT COULD NOT BE PASSED WITHOUT IT BUT DE WITT HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO RISK ILLEGALITY
BUT POPULAR FEELING ON BOTH SIDES WAS NOW AROUSED
FOUND THE ENGLISH FLEET OFF THE SHETLANDS A VIOLENT STORM AROSE FROM THE FORCE OF WHICH BLAKE WAS PROTECTED WHILE THE DUTCH VESSELS WERE SCATTERED FAR AND WIDE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY OUT OF NINETY NINE SHIPS TROMP COULD ONLY COLLECT THIRTY FIVE
BUT THE OLD SORES REMAINED OPEN MOREOVER THE REFUSAL OF THE STATES GENERAL TO RECEIVE THE PARLIAMENTARY ENVOYS THE MURDER OF DORESLAER AND THE PROTECTION AFFORDED TO ROYALIST REFUGEES HAD BEEN ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RESENTMENT
FULL OF RESENTMENT THOUGH HE WAS AT THE BAD TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED TROMP WAS TOO GOOD A PATRIOT TO REFUSE AT THE END OF NOVEMBER THE OLD ADMIRAL AT THE HEAD OF ONE HUNDRED WARSHIPS PUT TO SEA FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONVOYING SOME FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MERCHANTMEN THROUGH THE STRAITS
ADD THE STRAINED VINEGAR THE BEATEN YOLKS OF SIX EGGS AND TWO TABLESPOONFULS OF GRATED HORSERADISH BRING TO THE BOIL POUR OVER THE FISH AND SERVE PERCH A LA STANLEY
AND TO BID THEM TO TREAT WITH HARSH INGRATITUDE THE INFANT HEIR OF A FAMILY TO WHICH THE DUTCH PEOPLE OWED SO DEEP A DEBT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO PREPARE FOR A VIGOROUS RESUMPTION OF THE WAR STRONG EFFORTS WERE THEREFORE MADE AT DE WITT'S INSTIGATION
ARTICLE TWELVE STIPULATED THAT THE PRINCE OF ORANGE SHOULD NOT AT ANY TIME HOLD ANY OF THE OFFICES OR DIGNITIES WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BY HIS ANCESTORS OR BE APPOINTED TO ANY MILITARY COMMAND
THE ENGLISH NOW INSTITUTED A BLOCKADE OF THE DUTCH COAST WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING TO DESPERATE STRAITS A LAND WHOSE WELFARE AND PROSPERITY DEPENDED WHOLLY ON COMMERCE AMSTERDAM WAS RUINED IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES DIRECT NEGOTIATION WAS PERFORCE ATTEMPTED
THE EXPULSION OF THE MEMBERS AND ADHERENTS OF THE HOUSE OF STEWART INCLUDING THE PRINCESS ROYAL AND THE QUEEN OF BOHEMIA WITH THEIR CHILDREN
UNA RESPUBLICA WHICH NOTHING BUT SHEER CONQUEST AND DIRE NECESSITY WOULD EVER INDUCE THE DUTCH PEOPLE TO ACCEPT ACCORDINGLY THE WAR WENT ON THOUGH THE ENVOYS DID NOT LEAVE LONDON HOPING STILL THAT SOME BETTER TERMS MIGHT BE OFFERED
AND AS THE ORANGE PARTISANS WERE EVERYWHERE CLAMOROUSLY ACTIVE THE ADMIRAL WAS SUSPECT IN HIS PLACE CORNELISZ WITTE DE WITH WAS APPOINTED A CAPABLE SAILOR BUT DISLIKED IN THE FLEET AS MUCH AS TROMP WAS BELOVED DE WITH EFFECTED A JUNCTION WITH DE RUYTER
WHILE THE ENGLISH ON THEIR SIDE WERE SHUT OUT FROM THE BALTIC WHERE THE KING OF DENMARK AS THE ALLY OF THE UNITED PROVINCES HAD CLOSED THE SOUND AND FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN WHERE ADMIRAL VAN GALEN
HE INDUCED THE STATES GENERAL BY A BARE MAJORITY FOUR PROVINCES TO THREE TO SEND A CONCILIATORY LETTER THE DATE OF WHICH APRIL THIRTIETH SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE COINCIDED WITH CROMWELL'S FORCIBLE DISSOLUTION OF THE RUMP PARLIAMENT AND THE ASSUMPTION BY HIM
ALL OF THEM BEING CAPTURED OR BURNT WHILE BLAKE WITH THE MAIN FORCE OFF THE NORTH COAST OF SCOTLAND DESTROYED THE DUTCH FISHING FLEET AND THEIR CONVOY AFTER THESE FIRST BLOWS AGAINST THE ENEMY'S COMMERCE GOOD FORTUNE CONTINUED TO ATTEND THE ENGLISH
WHILE MANY ENGLISH PRIZES WERE CAPTURED THIS STATE OF THINGS WAS HOWEVER NOT TO LAST LONG TOWARDS THE END OF FEBRUARY SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE BLAKE PUT TO SEA WITH NEARLY EIGHTY SHIPS AND ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OFF PORTLAND MET TROMP AT THE HEAD OF A FORCE NEARLY EQUAL TO HIS OWN IN NUMBER
APPEARED AT FIRST TO OPEN OUT A PROSPECT OF FRIENDLIER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO NEIGHBOURING REPUBLICS IN JANUARY SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE THE GREAT ASSEMBLY FORMALLY RECOGNISED THE COMMONWEALTH
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE ARMY OF DICTATORIAL POWERS
THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO PASS A VOTE OF THANKS TO THE ENVOYS FOR NOT HAVING DELIVERED THE ACT TO CROMWELL DE WITT'S POSITION APPEARED HOPELESS
SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER DIP IN EGG AND CORN MEAL AND FRY IN DEEP FAT
NEAR THE GABBARD THE ENGLISH FLEET UNDER MONK AND DEANE EACH FLEET NUMBERED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SAIL BUT THE DUTCH SHIPS WERE INFERIOR IN SIZE SOLIDITY AND WEIGHT OF METAL FOR TWO DAYS THE FIGHT WAS OBSTINATELY AND FIERCELY CONTESTED
AND HE HAD MOREOVER BEEN AT SEA WITHOUT REPLENISHMENT OF STORES EVER SINCE THE FIGHT AT DUNGENESS WHILE THE ENGLISH HAD COME STRAIGHT FROM PORT THE FIGHT
THE ILL SUCCESS OF TROMP THOUGH HE WAS IN NO WAY TO BLAME FOR IT CAUSED CONSIDERABLE ALARM AND DISCONTENT IN HOLLAND HIS ENEMIES OF THE STATES PARTY IN THAT PROVINCE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT TO SUSPEND THE GALLANT OLD SEAMAN FROM HIS COMMAND HE WAS AN ORANGIST
AND THE RISK OF A RENEWAL OF THE WAR NO FURTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN AND THE PROTECTOR PROFESSED HIMSELF SATISFIED WITH A GUARANTEE OF SUCH DOUBTFUL VALIDITY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WITHHOLD ADMIRATION FROM DE WITT'S MARVELLOUS DIPLOMATIC DEXTERITY
THE OLD HERO FELL MORTALLY WOUNDED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF WHAT PROVED TO BE AN UNEQUAL FIGHT
AND THEN THE OFFICIAL LETTER FROM LONDON WAS READ TO THEM
TROMP WAS PREVENTED FROM FOLLOWING BLAKE BY STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS HE THEN TURNED UPON AYSCUE WHOSE SMALL FORCE HE MUST HAVE OVERWHELMED BUT FOR A SUDDEN CHANGE TO A SOUTHERLY GALE THE DUTCH ADMIRAL NOW SAILED NORTHWARDS AND JULY TWENTY FIFTH
SCARCELY LESS INJURIOUS WAS THE PROHIBITION TO ALIENS TO FISH IN BRITISH WATERS AND THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE RIGHTS BASED ON THE MAGNUS INTERCURSUS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF WHICH DUTCH STATESMEN HAD SO LONG AND STRENUOUSLY FOUGHT
AND SUCH WAS HIS PERSUASIVE SKILL THAT HE ACCOMPLISHED THE UNPRECEDENTED FEAT OF GETTING THIS DILATORY BODY TO ACCEPT THE CONDITIONS OF PEACE ALMOST WITHOUT DISCUSSION
BEFORE THE SITTINGS OF THE GREAT ASSEMBLY HAD COME TO AN END A YOUNG STATESMAN DESTINED TO PLAY THE LEADING PART IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DUTCH REPUBLIC DURING TWO DECADES HAD ALREADY MADE HIS MARK
TROMP WAS OBLIGED TO RETREAT HAVING LOST TWENTY SHIPS HE COMPLAINED BITTERLY AS DID HIS VICE ADMIRALS DE RUYTER AND DE WITH TO THE BOARD OF ADMIRALTY OF THE INFERIORITY OF THE VESSELS OF HIS FLEET AS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE ADVERSARY
AYSCUE HAD PREVIOUSLY SAILED UP CHANNEL WITH FORTY MEN OF WAR AND FIVE FIRESHIPS FOR A SIMILAR PURPOSE THE TWO FLEETS MET ON AUGUST SIXTEENTH AND DESPITE HIS INFERIORITY OF FORCE DE RUYTER FORCED AYSCUE TO WITHDRAW INTO PLYMOUTH AND WAS ABLE TO BRING HIS CONVOY HOME TO SAFETY
PROPOSITIONS BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE STADTHOLDER AS INDISPENSABLE TO THE SECURITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH SANCTIONED BY ALL THE PROVINCES EXCEPT HOLLAND AND SANCTIONED BY SEVENTEEN OF THE EIGHTEEN TOWN COUNCILS OF HOLLAND HAD REPEATEDLY
BUT IF SHE HAS A FAULT IT IS PRIDE MISTER BELLEW PRIDE PRIDE PRIDE WITH A CAPITAL P YES SHE IS VERY PROUD
AND NO PART OF HIS CONDUCT TO HER SINCE HER MARRIAGE HAD INDICATED TENDERNESS ON HIS PART OR HAD BEEN CALCULATED TO CALL FORTH TENDERNESS ON HERS HE HAD DONE ALL IN HIS POWER TO DISTURB HER DOMESTIC HAPPINESS
IT ISN'T MUCH OF A JUMP TO GO OVER YOUR HEAD REPLIED NIMBLEHEELS
AND HAVE BEEN BUT IMPERFECTLY DESCRIBED BY SOME OF THOSE WHO HAVE WRITTEN THE HISTORY OF HIS EXPEDITION THE OBSTACLES WHICH HE MIGHT EXPECT TO ENCOUNTER ON ENGLISH GROUND THOUGH THE LEAST FORMIDABLE OF THE OBSTACLES WHICH STOOD IN THE WAY OF HIS DESIGN WERE YET SERIOUS
HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE MADNESS IN HIM TO IMITATE THE EXAMPLE OF MONMOUTH TO CROSS THE SEA WITH A FEW BRITISH ADVENTURERS AND TO TRUST TO A GENERAL RISING OF THE POPULATION IT WAS NECESSARY
I'M PERFECTLY SATISFIED TO LIVE RIGHT ON THE GREEN MEADOWS WHICH SHOWS YOUR GOOD COMMON SENSE SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE BY THE WAY DANNY I SUPPOSE YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH NIMBLEHEELS THE JUMPING MOUSE
WOULD BE ALMOST AS GREAT A CALAMITY AS A DEFEAT SUCH A VICTORY WOULD BE THE MOST CRUEL WOUND EVER INFLICTED ON THE NATIONAL PRIDE OF ONE OF THE PROUDEST OF NATIONS THE CROWN SO WON WOULD NEVER BE WORN IN PEACE OR SECURITY
BUT HOLY BUT THOUGH SHE CAREFULLY ABSTAINED FROM DOING OR SAYING ANYTHING THAT COULD ADD TO HIS DIFFICULTIES THOSE DIFFICULTIES WERE SERIOUS INDEED THEY WERE IN TRUTH BUT IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD EVEN BY SOME OF THOSE WHO INVITED HIM OVER
THUS SHE WAS UNWONTEDLY DEAF AND UNRESPONSIVE TO SMALL PORGES WHO PRESENTLY FELL INTO A PROFOUND GLOOM IN CONSEQUENCE AND THUS SHE HELD IN THE EAGER MARE WHO THEREFORE SHIED AND FIDGETED
IT WAS SOME JUMP EXCLAIMED JUMPER THE HARE ADMIRINGLY
IN THAT SAME FAR NORTHERN COUNTRY IS A CLOSE RELATIVE CALLED THE BROWN LEMMING HE IS VERY MUCH LIKE BANDY SAVE THAT HE IS ALL BROWN AND DOES NOT CHANGE HIS COAT IN WINTER
FOR HIS SIZE AMONG ALL THE ANIMALS IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY WHEN I SAY THIS I MEAN THE GREATEST GROUND JUMPER
HAD BEEN AT HIS ABSOLUTE DISPOSAL BUT IN TRUTH IT SEEMED VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER HE WOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF A SINGLE BATTALION OF ALL THE DIFFICULTIES WITH WHICH HE HAD TO STRUGGLE THE GREATEST THOUGH LITTLE NOTICED BY ENGLISH HISTORIANS
SUCH GREAT BIG TEARS AND SO VERY QUIET WHEN SHE HEARD MY LITTLE STICK COME TAPPING ALONG SHE TRIED TO HIDE THEM I MEAN HER TEARS OF COURSE MISTER BELLEW AND WHEN I DREW HER DEAR BEAUTIFUL HEAD DOWN INTO MY ARMS SHE
REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE HOP UP ON THAT LOG SIDE OF YOUR COUSIN WHITEFOOT WHERE ALL CAN SEE YOU NIMBLEHEELS HOPPED UP BESIDE WHITEFOOT THE WOOD MOUSE AND AS THE TWO LITTLE COUSINS SAT SIDE BY SIDE
AND MAY COME THE LONGEST WAY ROUND YES IT'S IN MY MIND SHE WILL KEEP AWAY FROM DAPPLEMERE AS LONG AS EVER SHE CAN AND I THINK SAID BELLEW YES I THINK I'LL TAKE A WALK
THEN WHEN I DO WAKE UP I HAVE PLENTY TO EAT I MIGHT ADD SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE THAT WHEN HE GOES TO SLEEP FOR THE WINTER HE CURLS UP IN A LITTLE BALL WITH HIS LONG TAIL WRAPPED AROUND HIM AND IN HIS BED OF SOFT GRASS HE SLEEPS VERY SOUND INDEED
AND CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL AND PRICKLY PORKY THE PORCUPINE WHO WERE SITTING IN TREES KEPT THEIR PLACES YOU SEE THEY FELT QUITE SAFE AS SOON AS ALL THOSE WHO HAD RUN HAD REACHED PLACES OF SAFETY
IT'S ALL BEEN HERE SO LONG THAT THEM CHEERS AN TABLES HAS COME TO BE PART O THE OUSE SIR SO WHEN SHE COMES AN FINDS AS IT AIN'T ALL BEEN TOOK
BY THE HOLLOW TAP OF THE AUCTIONEER'S CRUEL HAMMER AND EACH TIME THE CLAMOURING VOICES ROSE SHE SHIVERED AND EVERY BLOW OF THE CRUEL HAMMER SEEMED TO FALL UPON HER QUIVERING HEART
BEEN NEGATIVED BY THE SINGLE VOICE OF AMSTERDAM THE ONLY CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDY IN SUCH CASES WAS THAT DEPUTIES FROM THE CITIES WHICH WERE AGREED SHOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE CITY WHICH DISSENTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPOSTULATION
THAT FOOD BECOMES VERY SCARCE WHERE THE LEMMINGS ARE THEN VERY MANY OF THEM GET TOGETHER JUST AS MIGRATING BIRDS FORM GREAT FLOCKS AND START ON A LONG JOURNEY IN SEARCH OF A PLACE WHERE THERE IS PLENTY OF FOOD
ANTHEA CLIMBED DOWN FROM THE HIGH DOG CART AIDING SMALL PORGES TO EARTH AND WITH HIS HAND CLASPED TIGHT IN HERS AND WITH LIPS SET FIRM SHE TURNED AND ENTERED THE HALL BUT UPON THE THRESHOLD SHE STOPPED
I KNOW SHE LOVES EVERY STICK AND STAVE OF THAT OLD FURNITURE BUT BUT NODDED BELLEW YES I UNDERSTAND MISTER BELLEW IF ANTHEA
LIKE JOHNNY CHUCK HE GETS VERY FAT BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP NOW NIMBLEHEELS SHOW US HOW YOU CAN JUMP NIMBLEHEELS HOPPED DOWN FROM THE LOG ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SITTING AND AT ONCE SHOT INTO THE AIR IN SUCH A HIGH
AND HAD ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF SPYING EAVESDROPPING
THE HATRED WITH WHICH THE HIGH COMMISSION AND THE JESUITS WERE REGARDED WOULD GIVE PLACE TO THE MORE INTENSE HATRED WHICH WOULD BE INSPIRED BY THE ALIEN CONQUERORS AND MANY WHO HAD HITHERTO CONTEMPLATED THE POWER OF FRANCE WITH DREAD AND LOATHING WOULD SAY THAT
BUT I LIKE BEST TO BE AMONG THE WEEDS BECAUSE THEY ARE TALL AND KEEP ME WELL HIDDEN
HE HAD CONSPIRED WITH TYRCONNEL AND WITH FRANCE AGAINST MARY'S RIGHTS AND HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR DEPRIVING HER OF ONE AT LEAST OF THE THREE CROWNS TO WHICH AT HIS DEATH
THEY THREW THEMSELVES UPON HIM AND HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN CAPTURING HIM WHEN THEIR FELLOW ADVENTURERS REACHED THE SPOT GOODNESS GRACIOUS CRIED BETSY WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU ALL
HE CONTINUED LISTLESS AND ALOOF IF HE HAD GIVEN HIS CONSENT TO THE UNDERTAKING OR RATHER ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE SWEPT INTO IT BY THE WISHES OF HIS OFFICERS IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE THE SERVICE OFFERED WAS OF A REGULAR AND HONOURABLE KIND
TO REST BETSY SAT ON HANK'S BACK POLYCHROME DANCED LIGHTLY UP AND DOWN THE JEWELED PATHS WHILE FILES AND THE PRINCESS WANDERED THROUGH THE GROVES ARM IN ARM TIK TOK WHO NEVER TIRED STOOD MOTIONLESS
YE'RE MAUDLIN WOLVERSTONE GROWLED WE'LL TALK AGAIN TO MORROW THEY DID BUT TO LITTLE PURPOSE EITHER THAT DAY OR ON ANY DAY THEREAFTER WHILE THE RAINS WHICH SET IN THAT NIGHT ENDURED
WE'VE BUT TO SPY THE CHANCE WHEN THE JAMAICA FLEET IS AWAY THERE'S ENOUGH PLUNDER IN THE TOWN TO TEMPT THE LADS AND THERE'S THE WENCH FOR YOU
HIS EYES BLAZING HIS LIVID FACE DISTORTED YE'LL LEAVE MY CABIN THIS MINUTE
AND ALL THE OTHERS WERE SILENT FROM SYMPATHY I WAS SO ASHAMED OF MY LOOKS CONTINUED THE VOICE OF SHAGGY'S BROTHER THAT I TRIED TO HIDE BUT THE CRUEL KING RUGGEDO FORCED ME TO APPEAR BEFORE ALL THE LEGION OF NOMES TO WHOM HE SAID
WOLVERSTONE LOOKED HIM OVER IN CONTEMPT THEN LAUGHED AND SPOKE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY ALL AROUND HIM OF COURSE WHAT ELSE AND HE LAUGHED AGAIN A LAUGH THAT SEEMED TO DYKE TO BE CALLING HIM A FOOL
NEWS HAS REACHED US FROM FRANCE THAT THERE IS WAR WITH SPAIN THAT IS NEWS IS IT GROWLED BLOOD I AM SPEAKING OFFICIALLY MY CAPTAIN I AM NOT ALLUDING TO UNOFFICIAL SKIRMISHES
HAD MADE RAGS OF EVERY INCH OF THEIR ONCE BRILLIANT UNIFORMS A MORE TATTERED AND WOEFUL ARMY NEVER CAME OUT OF A BATTLE THAN THESE HARMLESS VICTIMS OF THE ROCKY PASSAGE BUT IT HAD SEEMED THEIR ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM THE CRUEL NOME KING
HE HAD HIS INSTRUCTIONS IT WAS TAKING A DEAL UPON HIMSELF TO EXCEED THEM THE BUCCANEERS WERE FIRM
THAT THE SHARE OFFERED WAS TOO SMALL FOR ONE FIFTH OF THE PRIZES THE OFFICERS WOULD ANSWER FOR THEIR MEN NOT FOR LESS
HAGTHORPE ANNOUNCED AT ONCE THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS OPPORTUNE THE MEN WERE GRUMBLING AT THEIR PROTRACTED INACTION AND WOULD NO DOUBT BE READY TO ACCEPT THE SERVICE
PERHAPS RUGGEDO HIMSELF MIGHT BREAK HIS OWN ENCHANTMENT SUGGESTED ANN BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE ALLOWED THE OLD KING TO ESCAPE NEVER MIND MY DEAR BROTHER SAID SHAGGY CONSOLINGLY I AM VERY HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND YOU AGAIN
WOLVERSTONE CONGRATULATED HIMSELF UPON THE DISCRETION HE HAD USED WITH DYKE
THEN LISTEN AND OUT CAME THE TALE THAT WOLVERSTONE HAD TOLD THE CAPTAIN STEADIED HIMSELF TO GRASP IT IT'LL DO AS WELL ASERTRUTH SAID HE WHEN WOLVERSTONE HAD FINISHED
THAT WAS COMPOSED OF BUSTLING TRADERS OF SEVERAL NATIONS ENGLISH FRENCH AND DUTCH OF PLANTERS AND OF SEAMEN OF VARIOUS DEGREES
HE HAD NEVER YET BEEN KNOWN TO USE AND WOLVERSTONE IN TERROR BEFORE THAT FURY WENT OUT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD THE SUBJECT WAS NOT RAISED AGAIN AND CAPTAIN BLOOD WAS LEFT TO HIS IDLE ABSTRACTION
A MOMENT THEY SHARPENED IN THEIR GAZE AS HE BROUGHT HIS VISITOR INTO FOCUS THEN HE LAUGHED A LOOSE IDIOT LAUGH THAT YET SOMEHOW WAS HALF A SNEER AH THE OLD WOLF SAID HE
AND RUGGEDO PRESENTED A COMICAL SIGHT FOR SURELY NO MAN EVER BEFORE HAD SO MANY POCKETS OR ANY AT ALL FILLED WITH SUCH A CHOICE COLLECTION OF PRECIOUS STONES HE NEGLECTED TO THANK THE YOUNG LADIES FOR THEIR KINDNESS BUT GAVE THEM A SURLY NOD OF FAREWELL
HE HAD THE RIGHT IMAGINATION THAT KNOWS JUST HOW FAR IT IS SAFE TO STRAY FROM THE TRUTH AND JUST HOW FAR TO COLOUR IT SO AS TO CHANGE ITS SHAPE FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES HAVING DELIVERED HIMSELF OF HIS DECOCTION OF FACT AND FALSEHOOD
AND EVEN HER SHOES WERE SO CUT AND SLASHED THAT THEY WERE READY TO FALL FROM HER FEET THE OFFICERS HAD FARED SOMEWHAT WORSE THAN THEIR LEADER FOR HOLES WERE WORN IN THE KNEES OF THEIR TROUSERS WHILE SHARP POINTS OF ROCK IN THE ROOF AND SIDES OF THE TUNNEL
SHE TURNED AWAY IN A SHAMEFACED MANNER FOR ANN AND HER OFFICERS WERE INDEED A SIGHT TO BEHOLD HER MAJESTY'S CLOTHING ONCE SO RICH AND GORGEOUS WAS NOW WORN AND TORN INTO SHREDS BY HER LONG CRAWL THROUGH THE TUNNEL WHICH BY THE WAY
WHILST THE BLUE EYES THAT HAD BEEN SO VIVID AND COMPELLING WERE NOW DULL AND LACKLUSTRE WOLVERSTONE THE ONLY ONE WHO HELD THE CLUE TO THIS DEGENERATION VENTURED ONCE AND ONCE ONLY TO BEARD HIM FRANKLY ABOUT IT
CLOSING THE ROCK ENTRANCE SO THAT I COULD NOT GET OUT I FOLLOWED THE LENGTH OF THE TUNNEL UNTIL I REACHED THIS HUGE DOME WHERE THE MARVELOUS METAL FOREST STANDS AND HERE I HAVE REMAINED EVER SINCE POOR BROTHER REPEATED SHAGGY
I'VE MADE EM IF THEY THOUGHT AS HOW YOU'D TAKEN THE KING'S COMMISSION IN EARNEST AND FOR THE PURPOSE O DOING AS MORGAN DID YE GUESS WHAT WOULD FOLLOW HELL WOULD FOLLOW SAID THE CAPTAIN
THEY BECOME PRETTY TAME I BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE DECLARED SHAGGY MY DEAR BROTHER IS VERY WISE TO PREFER REAL TREES TO THE IMITATION ONES BUT COME LET US GO THERE AND FIND HIM SHAGGY STARTED FOR THE GREEN GROVE AT ONCE
ALSO THEY HOPED THEY HAD SEEN THE LAST OF THE DEGRADED KING I'M AWFUL GLAD HE'S GONE SAID BETSY SIGHING DEEPLY IF HE DOESN'T GET RECKLESS AND SPEND HIS WEALTH FOOLISHLY HE'S GOT ENOUGH TO START A BANK WHEN HE GETS TO OKLAHOMA BUT MY BROTHER
AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED HIM BEING CURIOUS TO WITNESS THE FINAL RESCUE OF HIS LONG SOUGHT LONG LOST BROTHER
IN THE GREAT CABIN OF THE ARABELLA HE FOUND PETER BLOOD ALONE AND VERY FAR GONE IN DRINK A CONDITION IN WHICH NO MAN EVER BEFORE REMEMBERED TO HAVE SEEN HIM AS WOLVERSTONE CAME IN THE CAPTAIN RAISED BLOODSHOT EYES TO CONSIDER HIM
SO THAT HE COULD NOT ATTACK THEIR QUEEN AGAIN BY THIS TIME SHAGGY POLYCHROME
AND WILLY WAGTAILS HAD A VERY POOR OPINION OF WHITE PEOPLE
RUGGEDO DID YOU SAY RUGGEDO CRIED THE MAN BECOMING MUCH EXCITED THAT IS WHAT SHE SAID REPLIED SHAGGY AND I BELIEVE SHE IS RIGHT
THERE IS NO COAST HERE WAS THE REPLY
AND WERE CURIOUSLY EXAMINING THE STRANGE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES
THERE WAS TIK TOK FLAT UPON HIS BACK AND SLIDING HEADFOREMOST DOWN THE INCLINE AND THERE WERE THE OFFICERS OF THE ARMY OF OOGABOO ALL TANGLED UP IN A CONFUSED CROWD FLAPPING THEIR ARMS AND TRYING TO SHIELD THEIR FACES FROM THE CLANKING SWORDS
NO ANSWERED THE KANGAROO BECAUSE PAST THAT PLACE WE CAN REACH SOME VERY WILD COUNTRY
AND THE SKIN OF ONE ARM WAS BRIGHT YELLOW AND THE SKIN OF THE OTHER ARM A VIVID GREEN HE HAD ONE BLUE LEG AND ONE PINK ONE WHILE BOTH HIS FEET WHICH SHOWED THROUGH THE OPEN SANDALS HE WORE WERE JET BLACK
SAID TIK TOK PICKING UP THE GUN AND EXAMINING IT WONDERINGLY FOR HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SUCH A WEAPON THEN ANN STRAPPED THE KNAPSACK TO TIK TOK'S COPPER BACK AND SAID NOW WE ARE READY TO MARCH TO RUGGEDO'S KINGDOM AND CONQUER IT
AS QUEEN ANN REACHED THE PLACE AND BEHELD HER KNEELING ARMY PERMIT US TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES REPLIED SHAGGY STEPPING FORWARD THIS IS TIK TOK THE CLOCKWORK MAN WHO WORKS BETTER THAN SOME MEAT PEOPLE
WHERE I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE CENTER OF THE EARTH ASKED BETSY HER VOICE TREMBLING A LITTLE THROUGH NERVOUSNESS WHY
WHICH SWUNG BACK AND FORTH DURING THE SWIFT JOURNEY AND POMMELED EVERYONE WITHIN THEIR REACH NOW FOLLOWED QUEEN ANN WHO HAD STRUCK THE TUBE IN A SITTING POSITION AND WENT FLYING ALONG WITH A DASH AND ABANDON THAT THOROUGHLY BEWILDERED THE POOR LADY
BUT JUST THEN SHE RECEIVED A SHOVE THAT ALMOST PITCHED HER FORWARD ON HER HEAD SO SHE DECIDED TO GO THE OFFICERS WHO HESITATED RECEIVED SEVERAL ENERGETIC KICKS BUT COULD NOT SEE WHO DELIVERED THEM THEREFORE THEY ALSO DECIDED VERY WISELY TO GO
HE WORE A ROBE OF SCARLET WHICH DID NOT COVER HIS ARMS AND EXTENDED NO LOWER THAN HIS BARE KNEES ON THE BOSOM OF THE ROBE WAS EMBROIDERED A TERRIBLE DRAGON'S HEAD AS HORRIBLE TO LOOK AT AS THE MAN WAS BEAUTIFUL HIS ARMS AND LEGS WERE LEFT BARE
OF COURSE DOT THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN SO THE KANGAROO TOOK HER TO THE ROCK WHERE THEY PEEPED THROUGH THE TREES AND SAW BEFORE THEM THE WEIRD SCENE AND DANCE DOT NEARLY SCREAMED WITH FRIGHT AT THE SIGHT SHE HAD THOUGHT SHE WOULD SEE A FEW BLACK FOLK
BUT ALL THE SAME SHE SOMETIMES WISHED SHE COULD BE A NOBLE KANGAROO AND NOT A DESPISED HUMAN BEING I WISH I WERE NOT A LITTLE WHITE GIRL SHE WHISPERED TO THE KANGAROO THE GENTLE ANIMAL PATTED HER KINDLY WITH HER DELICATE BLACK HANDS
AND KEPT TAKING OFF HIS OLD STRAW HAT TO THE OTHER BLACKFELLOWS AND TO THE REST OF THE TRIBE WHO KEPT UP THE NOISE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIRES NOW THIS IS BETTER SAID THE KANGAROO WITH A SMILE IT'S VERY SILLY
AND HELD ON FOR DEAR LIFE ALL AROUND WAS DARKNESS AND THEY WERE NOT FALLING DIRECTLY DOWNWARD BUT SEEMED TO BE SLIDING ALONG A STEEP INCLINE HANK'S HOOFS WERE RESTING UPON SOME SMOOTH SUBSTANCE OVER WHICH HE SLID WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF THE WIND
QUITE DISCONCERTED BY THIS UNEXPECTED EFFECT OF THE MAGNET SHAGGY DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM THE QUEEN'S ENCIRCLING ARMS AND QUICKLY HID THE TALISMAN IN HIS POCKET THE ADVENTURERS FROM OOGABOO WERE NOW HIS FIRM FRIENDS
AND FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR THEY CONTINUED THEIR FEARFUL JOURNEY THEN JUST AS THEY BEGAN TO FEAR THE TUBE WOULD NEVER END TIK TOK POPPED OUT INTO BROAD DAYLIGHT AND AFTER MAKING A GRACEFUL CIRCLE IN THE AIR FELL WITH A SPLASH INTO A GREAT MARBLE FOUNTAIN
YOU ARE AS NICE NOW AS MY BABY KANGAROO SHE SAID SADLY BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO GROW INTO A REAL WHITE HUMAN FOR SOME REASON THERE HAVE TO BE ALL SORTS OF CREATURES ON THE EARTH THERE ARE HAWKS SNAKES DINGOES AND HUMANS AND NO ONE CAN TELL FOR WHAT GOOD THEY EXIST
THIS POLE HE STUCK IN THE GROUND JUST IN FRONT OF THE WELL AND THEN HE CRIED IN A LOUD VOICE I HEREBY CONQUER THIS TERRITORY IN THE NAME OF QUEEN ANN SOFORTH OF OOGABOO
SHOULDER YOUR GUN AND STAND READY TO MARCH ADVISED FILES SO TIK TOK HELD THE GUN STRAIGHT AND STOOD STILL WHAT NEXT HE ASKED THE QUEEN TURNED TO SHAGGY WHICH ROAD LEADS TO THE METAL MONARCH'S CAVERN
TIK TOK TACKLES A TOUGH TASK WHILE SHAGGY AND HIS COMPANIONS STOOD HUDDLED IN A GROUP AT ONE SIDE THE ARMY OF OOGABOO WAS APPROACHING ALONG THE PATHWAY THE TRAMP OF THEIR FEET BEING NOW AND THEN ACCOMPANIED BY A DISMAL GROAN
WHO HAD SHAKEN OFF THE GRASP OF THE OFFICERS WITHOUT EFFORT AND WAS NOW TRYING TO PULL THE BATTERED CROWN FROM OFF HIS EYES SHAGGY WHO WAS ALWAYS POLITE HELPED HIM TO DO THIS AND WHEN THE MAN WAS FREE AND COULD SEE AGAIN HE LOOKED AT HIS VISITORS WITH EVIDENT AMAZEMENT
WHEN FIRST THEY TUMBLED INTO THE TUBE ALL WERE TOO DAZED TO THINK CLEARLY BUT THE TRIP WAS A LONG ONE BECAUSE THE CAVITY LED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE EARTH TO A PLACE JUST OPPOSITE THE NOME KING'S DOMINIONS AND LONG BEFORE THE ADVENTURERS GOT TO THE END
CRIED THE COLONELS DRAWING THEIR SWORDS
AND POLYCHROME DANCED WITH GLEE BUT ANN WAS FURIOUS AT THIS IGNOBLE DEFEAT OF HER GALLANT FORCES BY ONE SMALL MULE PRIVATE FILES I COMMAND YOU TO DO YOUR DUTY SHE CRIED AGAIN
THEN YOU ARE ENEMIES OF RUGGEDO
AND THAT'S ENOUGH TOO SAID FILES DO I GET A SALARY INQUIRED TIK TOK YOU GET YOUR SHARE OF THE PLUNDER ANSWERED THE QUEEN YES REMARKED FILES ONE HALF OF THE PLUNDER GOES TO QUEEN ANN
SHE WHISPERED TO DOT THAT IT WOULD BE NICE FOR A LITTLE HUMAN TO SEE SOME OTHER HUMANS AFTER BEING SO LONG AMONGST BUSH CREATURES AND SAID ALSO THAT THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DANGER IN HOPPING TO A ROCK THAT WOULD COMMAND A VIEW OF THE OPEN GROUND WHERE THE CORROBOREE WAS BEING HELD
BECAUSE ALL TUBES ARE MADE THAT WAY BUT THIS TUBE IS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND EVERYONE IS FORBIDDEN TO FALL INTO IT WE DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE EXPLAINED BETSY AND POLYCHROME ADDED I AM QUITE SURE THAT RUGGEDO THE NOME KING PUSHED US DOWN THAT TUBE HA
TIK TOK IS THE ONLY ONE OF OUR PARTY FITTED TO UNDERTAKE THE JOB WHAT MUST I DO ASKED TIK TOK OBEY ORDERS REPLIED ANN WHEN THE OFFICERS COMMAND YOU TO DO ANYTHING YOU MUST DO IT THAT IS ALL

ALLEGORICAL POEM ON SHAKSPEARE'S MULBERRY TREE
THE GREAT FIELD OF GENIUS AND EXERTION WHERE TALENTS OF EVERY KIND HAVE THE FULLEST SCOPE AND THE HIGHEST ENCOURAGEMENT IT IS A MEMORABLE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HIS PUPIL DAVID GARRICK WENT THITHER
THIS VOLUME WAS PUT FORTH IN A VERY ATTRACTIVE MANNER WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY JOHN LEECH WHO WAS THE FIRST ARTIST TO MAKE THESE CHARACTERS LIVE AND HIS DRAWINGS WERE VARIED AND SPIRITED THERE FOLLOWED UPON THIS FOUR OTHERS
RUDE AND BLIND CRITICISM S SADLY COUNTERBALANCED BY NUMEROUS FAULTS SAID WITH EPIGRAMMATIC POINT
SOMETHING STIFLING AND OVER PERFUMED SPINNING A NETWORK OF FALSEHOODS SPIRITUAL AND MORAL SIGNIFICANCE
THACKERAY WROTE OF IT WHO CAN LISTEN TO OBJECTIONS REGARDING SUCH A BOOK AS THIS
RIGID AND EXACT BOUNDARIES ROOTED IN IMMEASURABLE ERROR AND FALSITY ROUSED TO TUMULTUOUS ACTIVITY
SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DEAR SIR I HAD THE FAVOUR OF YOURS AND AM EXTREMELY OBLIGED TO YOU BUT I CANNOT SAY I HAD A GREATER AFFECTION FOR YOU UPON IT THAN I HAD BEFORE
SHE MUST HAVE HAD A SUPERIORITY OF UNDERSTANDING AND TALENTS AS SHE CERTAINLY INSPIRED HIM WITH A MORE THAN ORDINARY PASSION AND SHE HAVING SIGNIFIED HER WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT OF HIS HAND
BECAUSE ON THOSE DAYS SHE FORSOOK THE CHEERFUL SOCIETY OF HER MATES AND SOUGHT A SAFE SOLITUDE IN THE WOODS RETURNING AFTER A TIME WITH A JOCUND SMILE ON HER SMUG FACE AFTER ONE OF THESE PRIVATE LUNCHEONS REBECCA HAD BEEN TEMPTED BEYOND HER STRENGTH
AFTER EVERY SUCCESSFUL TRADE HE GENERALLY PASSED A LONGER OR SHORTER TERM IN JAIL FOR WHEN A POOR MAN WITHOUT GOODS OR CHATTELS HAS THE INVETERATE HABIT OF SWAPPING IT FOLLOWS NATURALLY THAT HE MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO SWAP
WHILE AUNT MIRANDA HAD THE POST OF OBSERVATION AT THE SITTING ROOM WINDOW SOMETIMES THEY WOULD WORK ON THE SIDE PORCH
THE NEXT MORNING AT RECESS REBECCA OBSERVED MINNIE TELLING THE TALE WITH VARIATIONS TO HULDAH MESERVE SHE THREATENED ME WHISPERED MINNIE BUT I NEVER BELIEVE A WORD SHE SAYS
I'LL STITCH THEM ON FOR YOU AND TRIM THE WAIST AND SLEEVES WITH POINTED TAPE TRIMMING SO THE DRESS'LL BE REAL PRETTY FOR SECOND BEST REBECCA'S JOY KNEW NO BOUNDS I'LL BASTE LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE SHE EXCLAIMED IT'S A THOUSAND YARDS ROUND THAT SKIRT AS WELL I KNOW HAVING HEMMED IT
CAPABLE WITH HIS CONTRADICTORY ORDERS AND HIS FONDNESS FOR THE EXTREME REAR OF LEADING ANY REGIMENT TO AN INGLORIOUS DEATH SOMETIMES THE LONG SUFFERING HOUSE WAS A LOG HUT AND THE BRAVE SETTLERS DEFEATED A BAND OF HOSTILE INDIANS
SEESAW WAS NOT WITH THEM SO SHE HASTENED HER STEPS IN ORDER TO SECURE COMPANY ON HER HOMEWARD WALK
SHE TRIED TO LIKE HER AUNT MIRANDA
TO BRIGHTEN MY DECLINING YEARS THERE FINALLY WAS A PINK GINGHAM AND WHEN IT WAS NICELY FINISHED AUNT JANE GAVE REBECCA A DELIGHTFUL SURPRISE SHE SHOWED HER HOW TO MAKE A PRETTY TRIMMING OF NARROW WHITE LINEN TAPE
STILL AUNT JANE'S PATIENCE HELD GOOD AND SOME SMALL MEASURE OF SKILL WAS CREEPING INTO REBECCA'S FINGERS FINGERS THAT HELD PENCIL PAINT BRUSH AND PEN SO CLEVERLY AND WERE SO CLUMSY WITH THE DAINTY LITTLE NEEDLE
IN PART AND BY DEGREES AND THE CONSTANT FITTING OF HERSELF TO THESE NEW AND DIFFICULT STANDARDS OF CONDUCT SEEMED TO MAKE HER OLDER THAN EVER FOR HER YEARS THE CHILD TOOK HER SEWING AND SAT BESIDE AUNT JANE IN THE KITCHEN
AND THE TOWN HELPED IN THE FEEDING AND CLOTHING OF THE CHILDREN GEORGE A LANKY BOY OF FOURTEEN DID CHORES ON NEIGHBORING FARMS AND THE OTHERS SAMUEL CLARA BELLE SUSAN ELIJAH AND ELISHA WENT TO SCHOOL WHEN SUFFICIENTLY CLOTHED AND NOT OTHERWISE MORE PLEASANTLY ENGAGED
AND THAT THERE CHARACTER AND THAT THERE FOUR SEVENTY FIVE O YOURN NOBODY EVER SEE ANY OF EM BUT YOU AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE EM AGAIN MISSUS SIMPSON WHO WAS DECIDEDLY ABNER'S BETTER HALF TOOK IN WASHING AND WENT OUT TO DO DAYS CLEANING
GREAT CARE WAS USED IN APPORTIONING THE PARTS FOR THERE WAS NO DISPOSITION TO LET ANYBODY WIN BUT THE AMERICANS SEESAW SIMPSON WAS USUALLY MADE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE BRITISH ARMY AND A LIMP AND UNCERTAIN ONE HE WAS
AND PERHAPS IF THE FACTS WERE KNOWN OTHERS BESIDES AURELIA THE RANDALLS WERE ALIENS
AS WELL AS VERDANT LEVELS ON WHICH TO BUILD HOUSES A GROUP OF TREES CONCEALED IT SOMEWHAT FROM VIEW AND FLUNG A GRATEFUL SHADE OVER THE DWELLINGS ERECTED THERE
BUT IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE THAT REBECCA AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER RIVERBORO CHILDREN HAD HEARD THE PARTICULARS OF THE WIDOW RIDEOUT'S MISSING SLEIGH AND ABNER SIMPSON'S SUPPOSED CONNECTION WITH IT THERE IS NOT AN EXCESS OF DELICACY OR CHIVALRY IN THE ORDINARY COUNTRY SCHOOL
THEN FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS THEY SUSPICIONED I WAS TRYIN FOR A PLACE TO TEACH SCHOOL AND WHEN I GAVE UP HOPE AN TOOK TO DRESSMAKIN THEY PITIED ME AND SYMPATHIZED WITH ME FOR THAT
MY MOTHER AND ALL YOUR RELATIONS AND THE PRESIDENT SAID REBECCA GAINING COURAGE AS THE NOBLE WORDS FELL FROM HER LIPS I DON'T CARE IF YOU TELL THE TOWN THE WHOLE OF YORK COUNTY THE STATE OF MAINE
IT'S BEEN SUCH A SIGHT OF WORK IF YOU THINK YOU COULD MOVE UP SOME STONES
WHEN THE FIRST BROWN GINGHAM FROCK WAS COMPLETED THE CHILD SEIZED WHAT SHE THOUGHT AN OPPORTUNE MOMENT AND ASKED HER AUNT MIRANDA IF SHE MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER COLOR FOR THE NEXT ONE I BOUGHT A WHOLE PIECE OF THE BROWN SAID MIRANDA LACONICALLY THAT'LL GIVE YOU TWO MORE DRESSES WITH PLENTY FOR NEW SLEEVES
SHE FINISHED GRANDILOQUENTLY
IN IT IN BEWILDERING CONFUSION WERE OLD SLEIGHS PUNGS HORSE RAKES HOGSHEADS SETTEES WITHOUT BACKS BED STEADS WITHOUT HEADS IN ALL STAGES OF DISABILITY AND NEVER THE SAME ON TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS
OR OCCASIONALLY WERE MASSACRED BY THEM BUT IN EITHER CASE THE SIMPSON HOUSE LOOKED TO QUOTE A RIVERBORO EXPRESSION AS IF THE DEVIL HAD BEEN HAVING AN AUCTION IN IT NEXT TO THIS UNCOMMONLY INTERESTING PLAYGROUND AS A FIELD OF ACTION CAME IN THE CHILDREN'S OPINION THE SECRET SPOT
I SEE SUSAN SIMPSON AND THE TWINS AND EMMA JANE PERKINS HIDING BEHIND THE FENCE REBECCA LEAPED OFF THE PORCH SNATCHED ALICE ROBINSON FROM UNDER THE CURRANT BUSHES
WAS RETURNING HOME BY WAY OF THE SHORT CUT
CLARA BELLE SUSAN AND THE TWINS WERE RUNNING ALONG THE PATH AND MINNIE WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN SHRIEKING WHAT MADE THE SLEIGH LOVE SIMPSON SO THE EAGER CHILDREN CRIED WHY SIMPSON LOVED THE SLEIGH YOU KNOW THE TEACHER QUICK REPLIED
IS NOT AN OBJECT OF DELIGHT MINNIE SMELLIE IF
THE CORAL HAD PARTLY SERVED ITS PURPOSE AS A RECONCILING BOND
THEY HAVE NOTHIN TO DO BUT GUESS AN THEY'LL GUESS RIGHT EVERY TIME I WAS ALL TUCKERED OUT TRYIN TO MISLEAD EM AND DECEIVE EM AND SIDETRACK EM
HANNAH TOOK AFTER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE SHE WAS ALL SAWYER POOR HANNAH THAT WAS TRUE HANNAH SPOKE ONLY WHEN SPOKEN TO INSTEAD OF FIRST LAST AND ALL THE TIME HANNAH AT FOURTEEN WAS A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH HANNAH LIKED TO KNIT
AND WHENEVER THE FEELING OF REMORSE WAS STRONG WITHIN HER SHE MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT TO PLEASE HER GRIM AND DIFFICULT RELATIVE BUT HOW COULD SHE SUCCEED WHEN SHE WAS NEVER HERSELF IN HER AUNT MIRANDA'S PRESENCE THE SEARCHING LOOK OF THE EYES THE SHARP VOICE THE HARD KNOTTY FINGERS
OR DIRT TRAPS SET IN HER GARDEN PATHS THE SIMPSON TWINS STOOD IN SUCH AWE OF HER THAT THEY COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO COME TO THE SIDE DOOR EVEN WHEN MISS JANE HELD GINGERBREAD COOKIES IN HER OUTSTRETCHED HANDS IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT REBECCA IRRITATED HER AUNT WITH EVERY BREATH SHE DREW
THE LAST GLIMPSE OF THE ROUTED SIMPSON TRIBE
AND LAUNCELOT WITH THIS SWORD SHALL SLAY THE MAN THAT IN THE WORLD HE LOVED BEST THAT SHALL BE SIR GAWAINE ALL THIS HE LET WRITE IN THE POMMEL OF THE SWORD
AND SHE GRANTED THEM WITH WEEPING IT SHOULD BE DONE RICHLY IN THE BEST MANNER NOW WILL YE SEND FOR A PRIEST THAT WE MAY RECEIVE OUR SACRAMENT AND RECEIVE THE BLESSED BODY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST YEA
AND THEN HE CAME AND SMOTE BALIN ON THE FACE WITH THE BACK OF HIS HAND AND SAID KNIGHT WHY BEHOLDEST ME SO FOR SHAME THEREFORE EAT THY MEAT AND DO THAT THOU CAME FOR THOU SAYEST SOOTH SAID BALIN
AND THERE BESIDE HE SAW A GREAT HORSE OF WAR TIED TO A TREE AND THERE BESIDE SAT A FAIR KNIGHT ON THE GROUND AND MADE GREAT MOURNING
THEN I BEHOTE YOU SAID BALIN PART OF HIS BLOOD TO HEAL YOUR SON WITHAL WE WILL BE FORWARD TO MORN SAID HIS HOST
AND SO WERE THEY BURIED BOTH AND THE LADY LET MAKE A MENTION OF BALAN HOW HE WAS THERE SLAIN BY HIS BROTHER'S HANDS
TO HEAR OF THAT BATTLE FOR THE GREAT BLOOD SHEDDING AND THEIR HAUBERKS UNNAILED THAT NAKED THEY WERE ON EVERY SIDE AT LAST BALAN THE YOUNGER BROTHER WITHDREW HIM A LITTLE AND LAID HIM DOWN
ALAS SAID BALIN ALL THAT MADE AN UNHAPPY KNIGHT IN THE CASTLE
AND DOUBT NOT BUT THE VENGEANCE WILL FALL ON THEE AT THE LAST WHEN BALIN WAS PAST THOSE COUNTRIES HE WAS PASSING FAIN SO HE RODE EIGHT DAYS OR HE MET WITH ADVENTURE AND AT THE LAST HE CAME INTO A FAIR FOREST IN A VALLEY AND WAS WARE OF A TOWER
INTO THAT ISLAND AND IT WAS BUT HALF A FOOT BROAD AND THERE SHALL NEVER MAN PASS THAT BRIDGE NOR HAVE HARDINESS TO GO OVER BUT IF HE WERE A PASSING GOOD MAN AND A GOOD KNIGHT WITHOUT TREACHERY OR VILLAINY
GOD KNOWETH I DID NONE OTHER BUT AS I WOULD YE DID TO ME ALAS SAID GARNISH NOW IS MY SORROW DOUBLE THAT I MAY NOT ENDURE
THEN BALIN WENT THROUGH ALL THE CHAMBERS AGAIN AND TOLD THE KNIGHT HOW HE FOUND HER
ALAS YE HAVE PUT YOURSELF IN GREAT DANGER FOR BY YOUR SHIELD YE SHOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN IT IS GREAT PITY OF YOU AS EVER WAS OF KNIGHT FOR OF THY PROWESS AND HARDINESS THOU HAST NO FELLOW LIVING
AND SO THEY AVENTRYD
LADY IT SHALL BE DONE AND SO SHE SENT FOR A PRIEST AND GAVE THEM THEIR RIGHTS NOW SAID BALIN WHEN WE ARE BURIED IN ONE TOMB AND THE MENTION MADE OVER US HOW TWO BRETHREN SLEW EACH OTHER
WAS THE FIRST THAT ROSE ON FOOT AND DREW HIS SWORD AND WENT TOWARD BALIN
AND ON WHITSUNDAY HE ACHIEVED THE SWORD AS IT IS REHEARSED IN THE BOOK OF SANGREAL SOON AFTER THIS WAS DONE MERLIN CAME TO KING ARTHUR AND TOLD HIM OF THE DOLOROUS STROKE THAT BALIN GAVE TO KING PELLAM
THERE WILL NEVER GOOD KNIGHT NOR GOOD MAN SEE OUR TOMB BUT THEY WILL PRAY FOR OUR SOULS AND SO ALL THE LADIES AND GENTLEWOMEN WEPT FOR PITY THEN ANON BALAN DIED BUT BALIN DIED NOT TILL THE MIDNIGHT AFTER
SUNDER AND WHEN BALIN WAS WEAPONLESS HE RAN INTO A CHAMBER FOR TO SEEK SOME WEAPON AND SO FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND NO WEAPON HE COULD FIND AND ALWAYS KING PELLAM AFTER HIM AND AT THE LAST HE ENTERED INTO A CHAMBER THAT WAS MARVELLOUSLY WELL DIGHT AND RICHLY
AND SO GALAHAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THE SCABBARD AND ACHIEVED THE SWORD THAT WAS THERE IN THE MARBLE STONE
WHEREFORE ALL THE WIDE WORLD SHALL SPEAK OF US BOTH ALAS SAID BALAN THAT EVER I SAW THIS DAY
KNIGHT WITH THE TWO SWORDS YE MUST HAVE ADO AND JOUST WITH A KNIGHT HEREBY THAT KEEPETH AN ISLAND
AND HOW BALIN AND BALAN FOUGHT TOGETHER THE MARVELLEST BATTLE THAT EVER WAS HEARD OF AND HOW THEY WERE BURIED BOTH IN ONE TOMB ALAS SAID KING ARTHUR
AND KING PELLAM LAY SO MANY YEARS SORE WOUNDED AND MIGHT NEVER BE WHOLE TILL GALAHAD THE HAUT PRINCE HEALED HIM IN THE QUEST OF THE SANGREAL FOR IN THAT PLACE WAS PART OF THE BLOOD OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST THAT JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA
SAID THESE TWO KNIGHTS SO THEY RODE MORE THAN A PACE TILL THAT THEY CAME TO A FAIR CASTLE WELL WALLED AND DITCHED I WILL INTO THE CASTLE SAID BALIN AND LOOK IF SHE BE THERE SO HE WENT IN AND SEARCHED FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND FOUND HER BED BUT SHE WAS NOT THERE
SO HE RODE FORTH THROUGH THE FAIR COUNTRIES AND CITIES AND FOUND THE PEOPLE DEAD SLAIN ON EVERY SIDE AND ALL THAT WERE ALIVE CRIED O BALIN THOU HAST CAUSED GREAT DAMAGE IN THESE COUNTRIES FOR THE DOLOROUS STROKE THOU GAVEST UNTO KING PELLAM THREE COUNTRIES ARE DESTROYED
AND GAVE ME LANDS HIS NAME IS DUKE HERMEL AND HIS DAUGHTER IS SHE THAT I LOVE AND SHE ME AS I DEEMED HOW FAR IS SHE HENCE SAID BALIN BUT SIX MILE SAID THE KNIGHT
INVISIBLE BUT I KNOW NOT HIS NAME AH SAID BALIN I KNOW THAT KNIGHT HIS NAME IS GARLON HE HATH SLAIN TWO KNIGHTS OF MINE IN THE SAME MANNER THEREFORE
FOR HERE IT HAPPED ME TO SLAY A KNIGHT THAT KEPT THIS ISLAND AND SINCE MIGHT I NEVER DEPART AND NO MORE SHOULD YE BROTHER AN YE MIGHT HAVE SLAIN ME AS YE HAVE AND ESCAPED YOURSELF WITH THE LIFE
AMONG KNIGHTS OF WORSHIP AND HIS LADY AFORE HIM SOON BALIN ASKED A KNIGHT IS THERE NOT A KNIGHT IN THIS COURT WHOSE NAME IS GARLON YONDER HE GOETH SAID A KNIGHT HE WITH THE BLACK FACE HE IS THE MARVELLEST KNIGHT THAT IS NOW LIVING
TO RIDE TOWARD THIS CASTLE THEN SAW HE AN OLD HOAR GENTLEMAN COMING TOWARD HIM THAT SAID BALIN LE SAVAGE THOU PASSEST THY BOUNDS TO COME THIS WAY THEREFORE TURN AGAIN AND IT WILL AVAIL THEE
AND HE MIGHT NOT HANDLE IT THEN MERLIN LAUGHED WHY LAUGH YE SAID THE KNIGHT THIS IS THE CAUSE SAID MERLIN THERE SHALL NEVER MAN HANDLE THIS SWORD BUT THE BEST KNIGHT OF THE WORLD AND THAT SHALL BE SIR LAUNCELOT OR ELSE GALAHAD HIS SON
AN YE WILL TELL ME WHERE SHE IS WHAT IS YOUR NAME SAID THE KNIGHT MY NAME IS BALIN LE SAVAGE AH SIR I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH
THE BASHFUL STUDENT HAD BECOME THE GENIAL COMPANION AND INTERESTING TALKER LOUIS OF BAVARIA WHO MADE MUNICH ONE OF THE ART CENTRES OF THE WORLD WAS HIS ADMIRER AND FRIEND
WHILST THE OPPOSITE SHORE IS STILL UNKNOWN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BREAKING UP OF THE ICE HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE EASTERN LOCKS FOR THIS STRAIT APPEARED ENTIRELY FREE
CONTAINED THE INFORMATION THAT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THE ESQUIMAUX HAD MET ON KING WILLIAM'S LAND A DETACHMENT OF FORTY MEN TRAVELLING ON THE ICE AND DRAGGING A BOAT THIN EMACIATED
AS DID THIS BANKER YOUNG THORWALDSEN NOW MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE DANISH AMBASSADOR TO NAPLES WHO INTRODUCED HIM TO THE FAMILY OF BARON WILHELM VON HUMBOLDT
VISITING ON THE WAY ALEXANDER OF RUSSIA WHO AFTER THORWALDSEN HAD MADE HIS BUST PRESENTED THE ARTIST WITH A DIAMOND RING ALTHOUGH A PROTESTANT ACCOUNTED NOW THE GREATEST LIVING SCULPTOR
AND HIS TRUNKS WAITED AT THE DOOR AS HE WAS LEAVING THE HOUSE HIS TRAVELLING COMPANION SAID TO HIM WE MUST WAIT TILL TO MORROW FROM A MISTAKE IN OUR PASSPORTS A FEW HOURS LATER MISTER THOMAS HOPE AN ENGLISH BANKER
MENDELSSOHN THE GREAT COMPOSER HAD BECOME HIS WARM FRIEND AND USED TO PLAY FOR HIM AS HE WORKED IN HIS STUDIO SIR WALTER SCOTT CAME TO VISIT THE ARTIST
WAS TOM'S COMMENT YES BUT IF THEY FOUNDER WHAT WILL BECOME OF DORA I DON'T BELIEVE ANY ONE OF THEM WOULD PUT HIMSELF OUT TO SAVE HER I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT THERE DICK
ALREADY FAMOUS THAT HAD JUST MADE AN ANTARCTIC CAMPAIGN UNDER JAMES ROSS IN EIGHTEEN FORTY THE EREBUS EQUIPPED BY FRANKLIN CARRIED A CREW OF SEVENTY MEN OFFICERS AND SAILORS
WITHOUT FURTHER WORDS THE BIG STEAMER'S ENGINES WERE STARTED UP AGAIN AND AWAY SHE SPED LEAVING THE SEARCHLIGHT TO SINK AND RISE ON THE ROLLERS LEFT IN HER WAKE
THE ACADEMY OF COPENHAGEN NOW SENT HIM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AS AN EXPRESSION OF THEIR PRIDE IN HIM HOW MUCH MORE HE NEEDED IT WHEN HE WAS NEAR STARVING ALL THOSE NINE YEARS IN ROME
SOME UNDER A BOAT TURNED UPSIDE DOWN OTHERS UNDER THE REMAINS OF A TENT
TO GET UNDER WAY TO NIGHT FOR LANCASTER STRAIT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER HIS DEPARTURE FROM DISKO BAY THE CAPTAINS OF TWO WHALERS THE PRINCE OF WALES AND THE ENTERPRISE
THAT I DON'T CARE IN THE LEAST WHAT THE WORLD THINKS ABOUT THESE THINGS SOMETIMES HE REFUSED EVEN TO DINE WITH THE KING FINDING AT LAST THAT SOCIETY WOULD GIVE HIM NO REST
WHAT DID THE POOR UNFORTUNATE MEN DO THEY DOUBTLESS EXPLORED THE SURROUNDING LAND ATTEMPTING ANY CHANCE OF SAFETY FOR THE ADMIRAL WAS AN ENERGETIC MAN AND IF HE DID NOT SUCCEED
GROANED DICK HE ISN'T DOING A SINGLE THING WITHOUT PAY WE MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT SOME PROVISIONS FROM HIM PUT IN MARTIN HARRIS
AND STRUCK WITH THE GRANDEUR OF HIS MODEL OF JASON ASKED THE COST IN MARBLE SIX HUNDRED SEQUINS OVER TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS HE ANSWERED NOT DARING TO HOPE FOR SUCH GOOD FORTUNE THAT IS NOT ENOUGH
IF HE TELLS THE TRUTH WE MAY AS WELL PUT INTO HARBOR AND MAKE FOR SAND HAVEN SAID MARTIN HARRIS WHO HAD NOW RESUMED THE CHASE ONCE MORE YES
A BOAT IS DEAD AHEAD CAME SUDDENLY FROM DICK AND SERGEANT BROWN ALSO GAVE A CRY OF WARNING THEN CAME A SHOCK AND A CRASH AND A SPLINTERING OF WOOD FOLLOWED BY THE CRIES OF MEN AND BOYS AND THE SCREAMS OF A WOMAN AND A GIRL
AND A LOADED GUN AT HIS SIDE FURTHER ON A BOILER WITH THE REMNANTS OF A HORRIBLE MEAL WHEN THE ADMIRALTY RECEIVED THESE TIDINGS IT BEGGED THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
THE TERROR HAD SIXTY EIGHT MEN
WHAT VISIONS OF FAME MUST HAVE COME BEFORE HIM NOW AS HE SAID GOOD BY TO HIS POOR PARENTS WHOM ALAS HE WAS NEVER TO SEE AGAIN AND TAKING HIS LITTLE DOG HECTOR STARTED FOR FAR AWAY ITALY
AND SAID HE HAD TWO PISTOLS AND CARTER HAD THE SAME ONE OF THE EXTRA WEAPONS WAS LOANED TO DICK AND THE SECOND WENT TO TOM IT WAS DECIDED
SOON A LEADING COUNTESS COMMISSIONED HIM TO CUT FOUR MARBLE STATUES BACCHUS GANYMEDE APOLLO AND VENUS TWO YEARS LATER HE WAS MADE PROFESSOR IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF FLORENCE
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT BECAME OF THEM SAID JOHN HATTERAS IN A FIRM VOICE YES THEY DID TRY TO REACH HUDSON'S BAY AND THEY SPLIT UP INTO SEVERAL PARTIES YES THEY DID MAKE FOR THE SOUTH
HE WAS MADE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMY OF SAINT LUKE A POSITION HELD BY CANOVA WHEN HE WAS ALIVE
AND RAN TO WHERE HE COULD NOT BE SEEN FROM THE OTHER YACHT HE PULLED FROM THE SEASHELL A SMALL SQUARE OF PAPER UPON WHICH HAD BEEN HASTILY SCRAWLED THE FOLLOWING IN LEAD PENCIL I WILL HELP YOU ALL
THE FORWARD MADE UP FOR LOST TIME SHE FLED ALONG SO QUICKLY THAT SHE PASSED OSBORNE BAY ON THE FOURTEENTH OF JUNE
BUT BEFORE THE GUN WENT DOWN THOSE ON THE OTHER YACHT SAW HER HEAD FOR THE COAST ONCE MORE I GUESS THE NOTE TOLD THE TRUTH SAID HARRIS IS SAND HAVEN NEAR HERE QUESTIONED TOM
I DON'T WANT HIS STUFF REMARKED SAM I'M AFRAID IT WOULD CHOKE ME IF I TRIED TO EAT IT THE STOP HAD GIVEN THE FLYAWAY AN ADVANTAGE
TO SEEK A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE SOON AFTER THE REIGN OF AUGUSTUS THEY OBLIGED THE DACIANS
DEPARTED LONG SINCE TO ENRICH THE BARBARIANS WITH OUR TREASURES AND NOW RETURNS WITH HER SAVAGE ALLIES TO CONTAMINATE
WHICH WAS CAPABLE OF RESISTING A SWORD OR JAVELIN
AND THE DUTIES OF ACTIVE LIFE THOSE WHO OCCASIONALLY MENTION THE EDUCATION OR TALENTS OF CONSTANTIUS ALLOW THAT HE EXCELLED IN THE GYMNASTIC ARTS OF LEAPING AND RUNNING THAT HE WAS A DEXTEROUS ARCHER A SKILFUL HORSEMAN
THE FIRST WILLIAM DID NOT DEGENERATE FROM THE VALOR OF HIS RACE BUT HIS TEMPER WAS SLOTHFUL HIS MANNERS WERE DISSOLUTE HIS PASSIONS HEADSTRONG AND MISCHIEVOUS AND THE MONARCH IS RESPONSIBLE NOT ONLY FOR HIS PERSONAL VICES
MIGHT BE EXCUSED BY THE PARTIALITY OF PATERNAL AFFECTION BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVES OF THE EMPEROR WHEN HE ENDANGERED THE SAFETY BOTH OF HIS FAMILY AND OF HIS PEOPLE BY THE UNNECESSARY ELEVATION
EXASPERATED A FREE AND COMMERCIAL PEOPLE ONE HUNDRED GALLEYS WERE LAUNCHED AND ARMED IN AS MANY DAYS THEY SWEPT THE COASTS OF DALMATIA AND GREECE BUT AFTER SOME MUTUAL WOUNDS THE WAR WAS TERMINATED BY AN AGREEMENT
CONSISTED ONLY OF LARGE WAGONS DRAWN BY OXEN AND COVERED IN THE FORM OF TENTS THE MILITARY STRENGTH OF THE NATION WAS COMPOSED OF CAVALRY AND THE CUSTOM OF THEIR WARRIORS TO LEAD IN THEIR HAND ONE OR TWO SPARE HORSES
AND ORDERED HIS TROOPS TO ASSEMBLE IN THE LOW COUNTRY OF PERTHSHIRE SOME OF THEM WERE QUARTERED AT SUCH A DISTANCE THAT THEY DID NOT ARRIVE IN TIME
AND A SERIES OF HUNGARIAN AND TURKISH WARS
THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION OF THE KINGDOM AND THAT THE FIRST DUTY OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO PUT AN END TO AN ANARCHY WHICH WAS DAILY PRODUCING DISASTERS AND CRIMES
IN ANY AGE OF THE EMPIRE HANNIBALIANUS ALONE WAS DISTINGUISHED BY THE TITLE OF KING
IN THEIR WARS AGAINST THE ROMAN CHURCH THE EMPEROR AND HIS SON MAINFROY
THE GREAT ADMIRAL WHO ABUSED THE CONFIDENCE AND CONSPIRED AGAINST THE LIFE OF HIS BENEFACTOR FROM THE ARABIAN CONQUEST SICILY HAD IMBIBED A DEEP TINCTURE OF ORIENTAL MANNERS THE DESPOTISM THE POMP
WITH A FORMIDABLE BODY OF CAVALRY
THIS INHERITANCE COULD ONLY BE ACQUIRED BY ARMS AND I AM PLEASED TO TRANSCRIBE THE STYLE AND SENSE OF THE HISTORIAN FALCANDUS WHO WRITES AT THE MOMENT AND ON THE SPOT WITH THE FEELINGS OF A PATRIOT
WOULD HAVE SENT TWO THOUSAND CLAYMORES TO THE JACOBITE SIDE BUT THAT WORD HE WOULD NOT SPEAK AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE CONDUCT OF HIS FOLLOWERS WAS AS IRRESOLUTE AND INCONSISTENT AS HIS OWN
THE SERVICE OF A NORMAN ARMY AND THE TRUCE OF THIRTY YEARS WAS NOT DISTURBED BY ANY HOSTILITIES BETWEEN SICILY AND CONSTANTINOPLE ABOUT THE END OF THAT PERIOD
WHO YIELDED TO THE PRESSURE OF THE GOTHIC POWER THEY SEEM TO HAVE CHOSEN A KING FROM THAT NATION
THE WALLS WOULD HAVE OFFERED VERY LITTLE RESISTANCE TO A BATTERING TRAIN BUT WERE QUITE STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP THE HERDSMEN OF THE GRAMPIANS IN AWE ABOUT FIVE MILES SOUTH OF THIS STRONGHOLD
WHICH AFFLICTED PALERMO THE ISLAND AND THE CONTINENT DURING THE REIGN OF WILLIAM THE FIRST
WHERE HE WAS EXPOSED ALMOST WITHOUT DEFENCE TO THE FURY OF THESE MONSTERS OF THE DESERT
AND THE SUBJECTS OF ANDRONICUS MIGHT SALUTE THE STRANGERS AS FRIENDS
TO RECOVER THE PROVINCES OF ITALY AND SICILY AND TO CHASTISE THIS PRETENDED KING
BELONGED TO HIS STEWARD OR TO HIS HEIR APPARENT THE MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY POST IN ATHOL WAS BLAIR CASTLE THE HOUSE WHICH NOW BEARS THAT NAME IS NOT DISTINGUISHED BY ANY STRIKING PECULIARITY
LORD MURRAY THE MARQUESS'S ELDEST SON WHO WAS MARRIED TO A DAUGHTER OF THE DUKE OF HAMILTON DECLARED FOR KING WILLIAM STEWART OF BALLENACH THE MARQUESS'S CONFIDENTIAL AGENT
THAT THE CRISIS REQUIRED PROMPT AND STRENUOUS EXERTION ON THE FATE OF BLAIR CASTLE PROBABLY DEPENDED THE FATE OF ALL ATHOL ON THE FATE OF ATHOL MIGHT DEPEND THE FATE OF SCOTLAND MACKAY HASTENED NORTHWARD
WHO CONSIDERED HIM AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MARQUESS OCCUPIED BLAIR CASTLE MURRAY WITH TWELVE HUNDRED FOLLOWERS APPEARED BEFORE THE WALLS AND DEMANDED TO BE ADMITTED
THE MOST PUSILLANIMOUS OF MANKIND ALREADY IN THE SHORT SPACE OF SIX MONTHS HE HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES A JACOBITE AND SEVERAL TIMES A WILLIAMITE BOTH JACOBITES AND WILLIAMITES REGARDED HIM WITH CONTEMPT AND DISTRUST
WERE DESTINED TO FORM THE EXTENT OF HIS NEW KINGDOM FOR EACH OF THESE PRINCES A SUITABLE ESTABLISHMENT WAS PROVIDED A JUST PROPORTION OF GUARDS OF LEGIONS AND OF AUXILIARIES WAS ALLOTTED FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE DIGNITY AND DEFENCE
CAN UNITE FOR THEIR COMMON SAFETY
THIS STATE OF THINGS WOULD HAVE ENDED IN SOME GREAT CONVULSION IF THE KING OF SCOTLAND HAD NOT BEEN ALSO KING OF A MUCH GREATER AND MORE OPULENT KINGDOM CHARLES THE FIRST HAD NEVER FOUND ANY PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER
THE GOTHIC KINGS ASPIRED TO EXTEND THEIR DOMINION FROM THE EUXINE TO THE FRONTIERS OF GERMANY
AND THE PROVINCES OF PONTUS CAPPADOCIA
WITH THIS VIEW HE SOLICITED THE ALLIANCE OF THE PEOPLE AND THE BISHOP OF ROME SEVERAL OF THE NOBLES EMBRACED THE CAUSE OF THE GREEK MONARCH THE SPLENDID NUPTIALS OF HIS NIECE WITH ODO FRANGIPANI
WHICH HAD BEEN INEXORABLY PROSCRIBED BY THE LATIN CLERGY AFTER THE LOSS OF HER DUKES APULIA WAS CHAINED AS A SERVILE APPENDAGE TO THE CROWN OF SICILY THE FOUNDER OF THE MONARCHY HAD RULED BY THE SWORD
HER LAUGH IS LIKE A RAINBOW TINTED SPRAY HER LIPS ARE LIKE TWO BUDDED ROSES HER LIPS LIKE A LOVELY SONG THAT RIPPLES AS IT FLOWS HER LIPS LIKE TWILIGHT WATER
HIS EYES GLOWED LIKE BLUE COALS HIS EYES WERE HOLLOWS OF MADNESS HIS HAIR LIKE MOLDY HAY HIS FACE BURNT LIKE A BRAND HIS FACE WAS GLAD AS DAWN TO ME
THOUGH IT HAD BROUGHT GREAT CALAMITIES BOTH ON THE HOUSE OF STUART AND ON THE HOUSE OF BOURBON HAD BEEN BY NO MEANS UNPROFITABLE TO HIMSELF HE WAS OLD HE SAID HE WAS FAT
A PIKE A LONG KNIFE CALLED A SKEAN OR AT THE VERY LEAST A STRONG ASHEN STAKE POINTED AND HARDENED IN THE FIRE THE VERY WOMEN WERE EXHORTED BY THEIR SPIRITUAL DIRECTORS TO CARRY SKEANS EVERY SMITH
IF THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWED HIM LESS THAN SUFFICED FOR HIS WANTS IT WAS NOT EXTREME TO MARK THE MEANS BY WHICH HE SUPPLIED THE DEFICIENCY THOUGH FOUR FIFTHS OF THE POPULATION OF IRELAND WERE CELTIC AND ROMAN CATHOLIC
WERE SELECTED FOR THE IMPORTANT SERVICE OF ORGANIZING AND DISCIPLINING THE IRISH LEVIES THE CHIEF COMMAND WAS HELD BY A VETERAN WARRIOR THE COUNT OF ROSEN
BANDON WHERE THE PROTESTANTS HAD MUSTERED IN CONSIDERABLE FORCE WAS REDUCED BY LIEUTENANT GENERAL MACARTHY AN IRISH OFFICER WHO WAS DESCENDED FROM ONE OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS CELTIC HOUSES
HE WAS THEREFORE A FAVOURITE WITH HIS MASTER FOR TO JAMES UNPOPULARITY OBSTINACY AND IMPLACABILITY WERE THE GREATEST RECOMMENDATIONS THAT A STATESMAN COULD HAVE
IT IS COMMONLY ASSUMED IT IS COMPARATIVELY EASY IT IS CURIOUS SOPHISTRY IT IS CURIOUS TO OBSERVE IT IS DESIRABLE FOR US
HE DANCED LIKE A MAN IN A SWARM OF HORNETS HE FELL AS FALLS SOME FOREST LION FIGHTING WELL HE FELL DOWN ON MY THRESHOLD LIKE A WOUNDED STAG
OR AN OLD GUN BARREL IN A CORNER OF A MANSION
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO RESPOND FITLY IT IS DIFFICULT TO AVOID SAYING IT IS DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE IT IS DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE
WAS TOO COSTLY FOR THE MUNIFICENCE OR TOO TRIFLING FOR THE ATTENTION OF HIS GRACIOUS AND SPLENDID HOST ON THE FIFTEENTH OF FEBRUARY JAMES PAID A FAREWELL VISIT TO VERSAILLES
WHO HELD THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL
AND NEVER HAD THE VAST PALACE AND THE SUMPTUOUS GARDENS PRESENTED A GAYER ASPECT IN THE EVENING THE TWO KINGS AFTER A LONG AND EARNEST CONFERENCE IN PRIVATE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE BEFORE A SPLENDID CIRCLE OF LORDS AND LADIES
HEELED LIKE AN AVALANCHE TO LEEWARD HER ARMS LIKE SLUMBER O'ER MY SHOULDERS CREPT HER BANNERS LIKE A THOUSAND SUNSETS GLOW HER BEAUTY BROKE ON HIM LIKE SOME RARE FLOWER
IT IS DIFFICULT TO PUT A LIMIT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SURMISE IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER IT IS EASY ENOUGH TO ADD
IT IS BUT FAIR TO SAY IT IS BUT TOO TRUE IT IS BY NO MEANS MY DESIGN IT IS CERTAINLY ESPECIALLY PLEASANT IT IS CERTAINLY REMARKABLE
IF ANY EVIL CHANCE SHOULD FORCE YOU TO RETURN BE ASSURED THAT YOU WILL FIND ME TO THE LAST SUCH AS YOU HAVE FOUND ME HITHERTO ON THE SEVENTEENTH LEWIS PAID IN RETURN A FAREWELL VISIT TO SAINT GERMAINS
HE SAW DISASTER LIKE A GHOSTLY FIGURE FOLLOWING HER HE SNATCHED FURIOUSLY AT BREATH LIKE A TIGER SNATCHING AT MEAT
HER DUSKY CHEEK WOULD BURN LIKE A POPPY
IT IS A POPULAR IDEA IT IS A RARE PRIVILEGE IT IS A RECOGNIZED PRINCIPLE IT IS A REMARKABLE AND STRIKING FACT IT IS A STRANGE FACT
HIS BASHFULNESS MELTED LIKE A SPRING FROST HIS BROW BENT LIKE A CLIFF O'ER HIS THOUGHTS
UNDERTOOK TO ANSWER FOR THE ZEAL AND FIDELITY OF THE IRISH PEOPLE WHOSE LANGUAGE HE COULD NOT SPEAK AND ON WHOSE LAND HE HAD NEVER SET HIS FOOT IT WAS NECESSARY TO RECEIVE HIS SUGGESTIONS WITH CAUTION SUCH WERE THE SENTIMENTS OF LEWIS
BURNED WHATEVER THEY COULD NOT REMOVE AND WELL ARMED AND MOUNTED SET OUT FOR THOSE SPOTS IN ULSTER WHICH WERE THE STRONGHOLDS OF THEIR RACE AND OF THEIR FAITH
IT IS ALL VERY FINE TO THINK IT IS ALL VERY WELL TO SAY IT IS ALMOST PROVERBIAL IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE IT IS ALSO PROBABLY TRUE
HER EYES AS STARS OF TWILIGHT FAIR HER EYES GLIMMERING STAR LIKE IN HER PALE FACE HER EYES WERE AS A DOVE THAT SICKENETH
IT IS MY GRATEFUL DUTY TO ADDRESS YOU IT IS MY HOPE
HE SPOKE WITH A UNIFORMITY OF EMPHASIS THAT MADE HIS WORDS STAND OUT LIKE THE RAISED TYPE FOR THE BLIND HE SWAYED IN THE SUDDEN GRIP OF ANGER HE SWEEPS THE FIELD OF BATTLE LIKE A MONSOON
AND IN THESE SENTIMENTS HE WAS CONFIRMED BY HIS MINISTER OF WAR LOUVOIS WHO ON PRIVATE AS WELL AS ON PUBLIC GROUNDS WAS UNWILLING THAT JAMES SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A LARGE MILITARY FORCE LOUVOIS HATED LAUZUN
BECAUSE NO PROSECUTOR DARED TO APPEAR ANOTHER DECLARED THAT HE HAD ARMED HIMSELF IN CONFORMITY TO THE ORDERS OF HIS SPIRITUAL GUIDE
FOR HE CAME HOME EVERY EVENING MORE AND MORE DEPRESSED AFTER THE NECESSARY LEAVE TAKING WHICH HE HAD RESOLVED TO HAVE WITH EVERY INDIVIDUAL PARISHIONER
MARGARET INEXPERIENCED AS SHE WAS IN ALL THE NECESSARY MATTER OF FACT BUSINESS TO BE GOT THROUGH DID NOT KNOW TO WHOM TO APPLY FOR ADVICE THE COOK AND CHARLOTTE WORKED AWAY WITH WILLING ARMS AND STOUT HEARTS AT ALL THE MOVING AND PACKING AND AS FAR AS THAT WENT
EVERYTHING WENT ON WITH THE REGULARITY OF CLOCKWORK ONCE A YEAR THERE WAS A LONG DISCUSSION BETWEEN HER AUNT AND EDITH AS TO WHETHER THEY SHOULD GO TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT ABROAD OR TO SCOTLAND BUT AT SUCH TIMES MARGARET HERSELF WAS SECURE OF DRIFTING WITHOUT ANY
DIXON YOU FORGET TO WHOM YOU ARE SPEAKING SHE STOOD UPRIGHT AND FIRM ON HER FEET NOW CONFRONTING THE WAITING MAID AND FIXING HER WITH HER STEADY DISCERNING EYE I AM MISTER HALE'S DAUGHTER
SHE LONGED TO ASK AND YET WOULD NOT HAVE HEARD FOR ALL THE WORLD THE FINE CRISP MORNING MADE HER MOTHER FEEL PARTICULARLY WELL AND HAPPY AT BREAKFAST TIME
BEHIND WHICH THERE MIGHT BE THE INEFFACEABLE PEACE AND GLORY OF THE ALMIGHTY THOSE NEVER ENDING DEPTHS OF SPACE IN THEIR STILL SERENITY WERE MORE MOCKING TO HER THAN ANY MATERIAL BOUNDS COULD BE SHUTTING IN THE CRIES OF EARTH'S SUFFERERS
TO HELP EDITH TO DRAW OUT THE LISTS OF WHO SHOULD TAKE DOWN WHOM IN THE DINNER PARTIES AT HOME NOR WAS THE HOUSEHOLD IN WHICH SHE LIVED ONE THAT CALLED FOR MUCH DECISION EXCEPT IN THE ONE GRAND CASE OF CAPTAIN LENNOX'S OFFER
YESTERDAY ONLY YESTERDAY REPLIED MARGARET DETECTING THE JEALOUSY WHICH PROMPTED THE INQUIRY POOR PAPA TRYING TO DIVERT HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS INTO COMPASSIONATE SYMPATHY FOR ALL HER FATHER HAD GONE THROUGH MISSUS HALE RAISED HER HEAD
YET LETTING HER FEET TOUCH THE GROUND WITHOUT FAIRLY STANDING DOWN AS SHE SHADED HER WET RUFFLED HAIR OFF HER FACE AND TRIED TO LOOK AS THOUGH NOTHING WERE THE MATTER
I DARE SAY
OR THE BAD AIR FROM SOME OF THE STAGNANT PONDS OH MAMMA SAID MARGARET FAINTLY SMILING AS SHE KISSED HER MOTHER I AM QUITE WELL DON'T ALARM YOURSELF ABOUT ME I AM ONLY TIRED MARGARET WENT UPSTAIRS
I HAD A COUSIN MISS WHO TURNED METHODIST PREACHER AFTER HE WAS FIFTY YEARS OF AGE AND A TAILOR ALL HIS LIFE BUT THEN HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A PAIR OF TROUSERS TO FIT FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD BEEN IN THE TRADE SO IT WAS NO WONDER BUT FOR MASTER
BUT WHILE SHE STOOD BY THE WINDOW THINKING HOW TO BEGIN AND WAITING FOR THE SERVANT TO HAVE LEFT THE ROOM HER MOTHER HAD GONE UP STAIRS TO PUT ON HER THINGS TO GO TO THE SCHOOL SHE CAME DOWN READY EQUIPPED IN A BRISKER MOOD THAN USUAL
FROM HER BETTER INFORMED CHILD MARGARET SAT DOWN BY HER MOTHER AND TOOK HER UNRESISTING HEAD ON HER BREAST BENDING HER OWN SOFT CHEEKS DOWN CARESSINGLY TO TOUCH HER FACE
IT IS WELL HE IS NOT ALIVE TO SEE WHAT YOUR FATHER HAS COME TO EVERY DAY AFTER DINNER WHEN I WAS A GIRL LIVING WITH YOUR AUNT SHAW AT BERESFORD COURT SIR JOHN USED TO GIVE FOR THE FIRST TOAST
AS IF SHE HAD ONLY BEEN ASLEEP I HARDLY CAN TELL WHAT TIME IT IS REPLIED DIXON IN AN AGGRIEVED TONE OF VOICE SINCE YOUR MAMMA TOLD ME THIS TERRIBLE NEWS WHEN I DRESSED HER FOR TEA I'VE LOST ALL COUNT OF TIME
BUT ALMOST ANY ONE BUT MISTER HALE WOULD HAVE HAD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH TO SEE THAT IN SO SHORT A TIME IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIX ON ANY HOUSE IN MILTON NORTHERN OR INDEED ELSEWHERE
NOT FAR OFF IT IS HALF PAST NINE YOU HAD BETTER GO TO BED AT ONCE DEAR ASK DIXON FOR SOME GRUEL I WILL COME AND SEE YOU AS SOON AS YOU ARE IN BED
NOT IN DISTANCE BUT IN NEVER MIND IF YOU REALLY THINK IT WILL DO YOUR MOTHER GOOD LET IT BE FIXED SO THIS WAS A GREAT STEP
MISSUS HALE WAS SILENT FOR SOME TIME QUIETLY CRYING AT LAST SHE SAID AND THE FURNITURE HOW IN THE WORLD ARE WE TO MANAGE THE REMOVAL I NEVER REMOVED IN MY LIFE AND ONLY A FORTNIGHT TO THINK ABOUT IT
MISSUS HALE SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO CRY I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU
MISTAKEN AS MARGARET FELT HER FATHER'S CONDUCT TO HAVE BEEN SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR IT BLAMED BY HER MOTHER SHE KNEW THAT HIS VERY RESERVE HAD ORIGINATED IN A TENDERNESS FOR HER WHICH MIGHT BE COWARDLY
DO YOU FEEL ILL MY DARLING ASKED MISSUS HALE ANXIOUSLY MISUNDERSTANDING MARGARET'S HINT OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF THEIR STAY AT HELSTONE YOU LOOK PALE AND TIRED IT IS THIS SOFT DAMP UNHEALTHY AIR
THE GORMANS WHO ARE OUR NEAREST NEIGHBOURS TO CALL SOCIETY AND WE HARDLY EVER SEE THEM HAVE BEEN IN TRADE JUST AS MUCH AS THESE MILTON NORTHERN PEOPLE YES SAID MISSUS HALE ALMOST INDIGNANTLY
THERE WERE THE THREE HARD FACTS HARDLY SPOKEN WHAT MAKES YOU SAY SO
I DID NOT HEAR YOU COME INTO THE ROOM SAID MARGARET RESUMING HER TREMBLING SELF RESTRAINT IS IT VERY LATE CONTINUED SHE LIFTING HERSELF LANGUIDLY OFF THE BED
BUT CATCHING A LOOK AT MARGARET'S STRAIGHT STERN BROW JUST HERE SHE COUGHED THE REMAINDER OF THE SENTENCE AWAY AND MEEKLY TOOK THE HOREHOUND DROP THAT MARGARET OFFERED HER TO STOP THE LITTLE TICKLING AT MY CHEST MISS
NEVER TO RETURN MISTER HENRY LENNOX'S VISIT HIS OFFER WAS LIKE A DREAM A THING BESIDE HER ACTUAL LIFE THE HARD REALITY WAS
CREAKING OF ONE OF THE BOARDS REMINDED HER THAT SHE MUST MAKE NO NOISE SHE WENT AND CURLED HERSELF UP
WHO WERE ONLY TOO PROUD TO BE ALLOWED TO COME TO THE PARSONAGE ON A BUSY DAY
THAT IT BECAME A LITTLE DOMESTIC JOKE TO WONDER WHAT TIME
SHE COULD NOT DOUBT BUT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPATIENTLY RECEIVED BY MISTER LENNOX IT WAS A BITTER MORTIFICATION TO HER IN ONE SENSE BUT SHE COULD BEAR IT PATIENTLY
OF PROPRIETY AND HER OWN HELPLESS DEPENDENCE ON OTHERS HAD ALWAYS MADE HER INSIST THAT A FOOTMAN SHOULD ACCOMPANY EDITH AND MARGARET IF THEY WENT BEYOND HARLEY STREET OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD
FROM THE LOW BRUSHWOOD OR TANGLED FURZE IT WAS A TRIAL TO COME DOWN FROM SUCH MOTION OR SUCH STILLNESS
BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT HER MOTHER WAS INCLINED TO LOOK UPON THIS NEW FRIENDSHIP OF HER HUSBAND'S WITH JEALOUS EYES AS LONG AS HIS TIME HAD BEEN SOLELY OCCUPIED WITH HIS BOOKS AND HIS PARISHIONERS
SHE ASKED MARGARET IF SHE REMEMBERED THE DAY TWELVE MONTH ON WHICH SHE EDITH WROTE HOW IT RAINED ALL DAY LONG IN HARLEY STREET
MARGARET SAT DOWN ON A BOX THE DIRECTION CARD UPON WHICH STRUCK HER AS HAVING BEEN WRITTEN AT HELSTONE BEAUTIFUL BELOVED HELSTONE SHE LOST HERSELF IN DISMAL THOUGHT
PROUD BONNY FACE LIKE A BOOK COME ALONG BESS THERE'S THE MILL BELL RINGING MARGARET WENT HOME WONDERING AT HER NEW FRIENDS AND SMILING AT THE MAN'S INSIGHT
AND HERE THEY MUST REMAIN
SHE WAS THROWN WITH ONE OR TWO OF THOSE WHO IN ALL MEASURES AFFECTING MASSES OF PEOPLE MUST BE ACUTE SUFFERERS FOR THE GOOD OF MANY THE QUESTION ALWAYS IS
OF ITS EXERCISE BUT MARGARET WENT LESS ABROAD AMONG MACHINERY AND MEN SAW LESS OF POWER IN ITS PUBLIC EFFECT
AND HALF SMILED BACK AT THEIR REMARKS SHE DID NOT MIND MEETING ANY NUMBER OF GIRLS LOUD SPOKEN AND BOISTEROUS THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE BUT SHE ALTERNATELY DREADED AND FIRED UP AGAINST THE WORKMEN
BUT IF SHE HAD KNOWN HOW LONG IT WOULD BE BEFORE THE BRIGHTNESS CAME HER HEART WOULD HAVE SUNK LOW DOWN THE TIME OF THE YEAR WAS MOST UNPROPITIOUS TO HEALTH AS WELL AS TO SPIRITS
THE DISTANCE WAS TOO GREAT MISTER HALE MET WITH SEVERAL PUPILS RECOMMENDED TO HIM BY MISTER BELL OR BY THE MORE
AND MAYBE DON'T KNOW MANY FOLK HERE AND YO'VE GIVEN MY WENCH HERE FLOWERS OUT OF YO'R OWN HAND YO MAY COME IF YO LIKE
SO MOST OF THE MANUFACTURERS PLACED THEIR SONS IN SUCKING SITUATIONS AT FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE
SHE DOUBTED IF ANY ONE OF THAT OLD SET EVER THOUGHT OF HER EXCEPT HENRY LENNOX
THEY COULD HEAR OF NO GIRL TO ASSIST HER ALL WERE AT WORK IN THE FACTORIES AT LEAST THOSE WHO APPLIED WERE WELL SCOLDED BY DIXON FOR THINKING THAT SUCH AS THEY COULD EVER BE TRUSTED TO WORK IN A GENTLEMAN'S HOUSE
BUT AT LAST SHE DETERMINED TO TAKE HER MIND AWAY FROM THE PRESENT AND SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD A LETTER FROM EDITH WHICH SHE HAD ONLY HALF READ IN THE BUSTLE OF THE MORNING IT WAS TO TELL OF THEIR ARRIVAL AT CORFU
IN ITS ROUGH WHOLESALE JUDGMENT WOULD HAVE OPPRESSED AND IRRITATED MISTER LENNOX AS SHE REALISED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHE GREW TO BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT WAS THEY WERE AT THE LOWEST NOW THEY COULD NOT BE WORSE
AND KEPT TWO SERVANTS ONE OF THEM SO VERY HIGH AND MIGHTY
MISTER HALE WAS EQUALLY OUT OF SPIRITS AND EQUALLY CAME UPON MARGARET FOR SYMPATHY MARGARET
MARGARET WAS WEARY AND IMPATIENT OF THE ACCOUNTS WHICH DIXON PERPETUALLY BROUGHT
AS AT HELSTONE SHE HAD APPEARED TO CARE LITTLE WHETHER SHE SAW MUCH OF HIM OR NOT BUT NOW THAT HE LOOKED EAGERLY FORWARD TO EACH RENEWAL OF HIS INTERCOURSE WITH MISTER THORNTON SHE SEEMED HURT AND ANNOYED
MISTER THORNTON WAS PERHAPS THE OLDEST OF MISTER HALE'S PUPILS
GLAD TO THINK THAT HER LOOKS SUCH AS THEY WERE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE POWER TO CALL UP A PLEASANT THOUGHT HE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND HER ACKNOWLEDGING GLANCE AND A SILENT RECOGNITION WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM
EDITH'S ASTONISHMENT AND HER AUNT SHAW'S DISMAY WOULD HAVE TO BE MET BRAVELY WHEN THEIR LETTERS CAME SO MARGARET ROSE UP AND BEGAN SLOWLY TO UNDRESS HERSELF
THE GAY NEW LIFE OPENING UPON HER
HER MOTHER CAUGHT A SEVERE COLD AND DIXON HERSELF WAS EVIDENTLY NOT WELL ALTHOUGH MARGARET COULD NOT INSULT HER MORE THAN BY TRYING TO SAVE HER OR BY TAKING ANY CARE OF HER
LATE AS IT WAS IN THE YEAR SEEMED SPENT IN BOATING OR LAND PIC NICS ALL OUT OF DOORS PLEASURE SEEKING AND GLAD
WHOSE STEPS WERE REGULATED BY THE FEEBLENESS OF THE LATTER SHE NOW SPOKE TO THE GIRL AND THERE WAS A SOUND OF TENDER PITY IN THE TONE OF HER VOICE AS SHE DID SO THAT WENT RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THE FATHER
SHE READ THIS MEANING TOO IN THE MAN'S EYES I'M NONE SO FOND OF HAVING STRANGE FOLK IN MY HOUSE BUT THEN RELENTING AS HE SAW HER HEIGHTENED COLOUR HE ADDED YO'RE A FOREIGNER AS ONE MAY SAY
I'M NONE SO SURE O THAT
ALL CAME VIVIDLY BEFORE HER IN STRANGE CONTRAST TO THE PRESENT TIME THE SMOOTH SEA OF THAT OLD LIFE CLOSED UP WITHOUT A MARK LEFT TO TELL WHERE THEY HAD ALL BEEN
SHE HAD HEARD HIM OFTEN BOAST OF HIS POWER OF PUTTING ANY DISAGREEABLE THOUGHT FAR AWAY FROM HIM THEN SHE PENETRATED FARTHER INTO WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF SHE HAD CARED FOR HIM AS A LOVER AND HAD ACCEPTED HIM
THE SOBS OF THE MOURNERS DEEP AND LOW SHELLEY AT THE TIME ARRANGED THE PREVIOUS DAY THEY SET OUT ON THEIR WALK TO SEE NICHOLAS HIGGINS AND HIS DAUGHTER
OR HELP ON THE RIGHT AND JUST CAUSE THOUGH IT GOES AGAIN THE STRONG HAND
AND TO MIND THAT THEY WERE ORPHANS AND THEIR MOTHER A WIDOW IT WAS WHO COULD DO MOST AND THE CHILDER ARE SURE OF A BELLYFUL TO DAY AND OF KINDNESS TOO DOES HOO KNOW HOW HE DIED NO SAID MARGARET I COULD NOT TELL HER ALL AT ONCE
WITH A BLACK UNSHAVEN BEARD OF SEVERAL DAYS GROWTH MAKING HIS PALE FACE LOOK YET PALER AND A JACKET WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL THE BETTER FOR PATCHING WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF FINDING YOU JUST AFTER DINNER TIME
BUT THORNTON HAVING GOT HIS OWN PURPOSE
ALL AT ONCE MARGARET SAW THAT HER FATHER WAS INDEED UNABLE HE WAS TREMBLING FROM HEAD TO FOOT I WILL GO SAID SHE BLESS YO MISS IT WILL BE A KIND ACT
ASKED HER FATHER I WAS THINKING OF HIM TOO THEY KNOCKED THERE WAS NO ANSWER SO THEY TRIED THE DOOR IT WAS BOLTED BUT THEY THOUGHT THEY HEARD HIM MOVING WITHIN NICHOLAS
NO YOU YOU SAID MARGARET THEY AWAITED HER PERFECT RECOVERY IN SILENCE THEN THE NEIGHBOUR WOMAN SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK MISSUS BOUCHER'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS ON HER LAP
AND BAD WORDS IS PLENTIFUL HE WAS IN A MOOD TO TAKE A SURLY PLEASURE IN GIVING ANSWERS THAT WERE LIKE RIDDLES BUT MARGARET SAW THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO BE ASKED FOR THE EXPLANATION AND GOOD WORDS ARE ASKING FOR WORK
THOUGH MARGARET COULD READ THE WELCOME IN HIS EYE SIT YE DOWN SIT YE DOWN FIRE'S WELLY OUT SAID HE GIVING IT A VIGOROUS POKE AS IF TO TURN ATTENTION AWAY FROM HIMSELF HE WAS RATHER DISORDERLY TO BE SURE
ADDRESSING HERSELF IN NO VERY GENTLE VOICE
SAID MARGARET THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND THEY MIGHT HAVE GONE AWAY BELIEVING THE HOUSE TO BE EMPTY IF THERE HAD NOT BEEN SOME ACCIDENTAL FALL AS OF A BOOK WITHIN NICHOLAS SAID MARGARET AGAIN
AND EVERY SEPARATE LOCK WAS A CONDUIT FOR WATER THROUGH ALL THESE DISFIGUREMENTS MARGARET RECOGNISED JOHN BOUCHER IT SEEMED TO HER SO SACRILEGIOUS TO BE PEERING INTO THAT POOR
MAPPEN AS TENDER AS A MOTHER
MARGARET SAID SOMETHING SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HER THROAT AND MOUTH WERE SO DRY AND THE CHILDREN'S NOISE COMPLETELY PREVENTED HER FROM BEING HEARD SHE TRIED AGAIN HOW ARE YOU MISSUS BOUCHER BUT VERY POORLY I'M AFRAID
I COULD MAPPEN HA LEARNT IF ANY ONE HAD TRIED TO TEACH ME WOULD IT NOT BE WORTH WHILE SAID MISTER HALE TO ASK YOUR OLD MASTER IF HE WOULD TAKE YOU BACK AGAIN IT MIGHT BE A POOR CHANCE BUT IT WOULD BE A CHANCE
I'LL STOP WITH HER AS LONG AS I'M NEEDED
I'M SORRY THEY TOOK THE BABBY I'LL GO FOR IT SAID MARGARET AND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE RETURNED CARRYING JOHNNIE HIS FACE ALL SMEARED WITH EATING AND HIS HANDS LOADED WITH TREASURES IN THE SHAPE OF SHELLS
SO THAT WHEN SHE COMES ROUND SHE SHOULD ONLY FIND ONE OR TWO THAT SHE KNOWS ABOUT HER PAPA WILL YOU SPEAK TO THE MEN AND GET THEM TO GO AWAY SHE CANNOT BREATHE POOR THING WITH THIS CROWD ABOUT HER MARGARET WAS KNEELING DOWN BY MISSUS BOUCHER
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX UNION NOT ALWAYS STRENGTH THE STEPS OF THE BEARERS HEAVY
SEE HOO'S COMING ROUND SHALL YOU OR I DO IT
BUT YO MUN PROMISE NOT GIVE IT TO HIM
SHE APOLOGETICALLY CONTINUED TO MARGARET
THAT HE'S OBLIGED TO COME IN AND BE WISE AND HELPFUL IN SPITE OF HIMSELF BOUCHER WERE A FOOL ALL ALONG
HE'S LIKER A WEED LOUNGING OVER THE GROUND MUN JUST MAKE UP THEIR MIND TO BE PUT OUT O THE WAY I'M SORE VEXED WI HIM JUST NOW SO MAPPEN I DUNNOT SPEAK HIM FAIR
AND SAID IN A WEAK PIPING KIND OF VOICE IT'S NOT JOHN BOUCHER HE HAD NA SPUNK ENOUGH SURE IT'S NOT JOHN BOUCHER WHY THEY ARE A LOOKING THIS WAY
OPEN IT QUICK SAID SHE TO THE ELDEST CHILD IT'S BOLTED MAKE NO NOISE BE VERY STILL
DON'T YOU SEE HOW YOU'VE MADE BOUCHER WHAT HE IS BY DRIVING HIM INTO THE UNION AGAINST HIS WILL WITHOUT HIS HEART GOING WITH IT YOU HAVE MADE HIM WHAT HE IS MADE HIM WHAT HE IS WHAT WAS HE
AND THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER PERHAPS TO SET AN EXAMPLE OF CLEARING THE HOUSE WHICH WAS FILLED WITH IDLE IF SYMPATHISING GAZERS SHE LOOKED ROUND FOR NICHOLAS HIGGINS
HE LOOKED UP AGAIN WITH A SHARP GLANCE AT THE QUESTIONER AND THEN TITTERED A LOW AND BITTER LAUGH
DISTORTED AGONISED FACE THAT BY A FLASH OF INSTINCT SHE WENT FORWARDS AND SOFTLY COVERED THE DEAD MAN'S COUNTENANCE WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF
THREE OF THEM BEING POLICEMEN THEY CARRIED A DOOR TAKEN OFF ITS HINGES UPON THEIR SHOULDERS ON WHICH LAY SOME DEAD HUMAN CREATURE AND FROM EACH SIDE OF THE DOOR THERE WERE CONSTANT DROPPINGS
AND EVEN UNSEEN TO THE WOMAN FASTENING THE BOLT MISSUS BOUCHER WAS SITTING IN A ROCKING CHAIR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ILL REDD UP FIREPLACE IT LOOKED AS IF THE HOUSE HAD BEEN UNTOUCHED FOR DAYS BY ANY EFFORT AT CLEANLINESS
AND I RECKON THEY'LL FIND THAT THEY CANNOT STICK TO IT BUT IT'S IN FORCE NOW BY AND BY THEY'LL FIND OUT TYRANTS MAKES LIARS THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE MARGARET WAS HESITATING WHETHER SHE SHOULD SAY WHAT WAS IN HER MIND
I NEVER GO TO LONDON SO I AM NOT LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO AVAIL MYSELF OF YOUR POLITE OFFERS AT THIS INSTANT MISTER THORNTON ENTERED THE ROOM HE HAD ONLY JUST RETURNED FROM OXFORD
AND DIXON AND PERSONAL EXPENSES AND CONFECTIONERY ALL YOUNG LADIES EAT CONFECTIONERY TILL WISDOM COMES BY AGE I SHALL CONSULT SOME LADY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE AND SEE HOW MUCH YOU WILL HAVE FROM YOUR FATHER BEFORE FIXING THIS
HIS MOURNING SUIT SPOKE OF THE REASON THAT HAD CALLED HIM THERE JOHN SAID HIS MOTHER THIS LADY IS MISSUS SHAW MISS HALE'S AUNT I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT MISS HALE'S CALL IS TO WISH US GOOD BYE
SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LIE DOWN AGAIN AND TRY NOT TO THINK MY DEAREST CHILD HAS THAT LETTER VEXED OR TROUBLED YOU NO SAID MARGARET FEEBLY I SHALL BE BETTER WHEN TO MORROW IS OVER
AND YO'RE GOING TO BE A GRAND LADY UP LUNNON AREN'T YO NOT A GRAND LADY SAID MARGARET HALF SMILING WELL THORNTON SAID SAYS HE A DAY OR TWO AGO
THE MEANEST THING TO WHICH WE BID ADIEU LOSES ITS MEANNESS IN THE PARTING HOUR ELLIOTT
FOR PAYING TWO VISITS THAT SHE HAD OFTEN MADE BY HERSELF AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY SHE WAS HALF AFRAID OF OWNING THAT ONE PLACE TO WHICH SHE WAS GOING WAS NICHOLAS HIGGINS
SAID MISSUS SHAW LOOKING FONDLY AT MARGARET AND I AM GLAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY OWN OBLIGATION FOR ANY KINDNESS THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HER IF YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND EVER COME TO TOWN MY SON AND DAUGHTER
HER BODY AS IF IN ACUTE SUFFERING AND SAID OH LET US GO I CANNOT BE PATIENT HERE I SHALL NOT GET WELL HERE I WANT TO FORGET SO THE ARRANGEMENTS WENT ON
AND LANGUIDLY SETTING ASIDE SUCH ARTICLES AS SHE WISHED TO RETAIN DIXON FOLLOWED HER BY MISSUS SHAW'S DESIRE OSTENSIBLY TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS
OF COURSE THERE IS NONE OR YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND IT BY THIS TIME IF YOU FOLLOWED MY DIRECTIONS THEN THE CAPTAIN DECLARES HE MUST TAKE YOU AND HIS MOTHER IN LAW HOME AND
BUT TO DAY IS MY ONLY DAY IF CAPTAIN LENNOX COMES THIS AFTERNOON AND IF WE MUST IF I MUST REALLY GO TO MORROW OH YES WE SHALL GO TO MORROW
AND SHE AND MISSUS SHAW CONSULTED AS TO THE DESIRABLENESS OF DELAYING THE MORROW'S JOURNEY BUT WHEN HER AUNT RELUCTANTLY PROPOSED A FEW DAYS DELAY TO MARGARET
THEN SAID I THERE'S AS GOOD A MAN GONE AS EVER LIVED ON THIS EARTH LET WHO WILL BE T OTHER AND I CAME TO SEE YO AND TELL YO HOW GRIEVED I WERE
IF I DUNNOT SEE HER AFORE HOO GOES I'LL STRIVE TO GET UP TO LUNNUN NEXT WHISSUNTIDE THAT I WILL I'LL NOT BE BAULKED OF SAYING HER GOOD BYE BY ANY RELATIONS WHATSOMDEVER
WHICH HAD SUGGESTED THEMSELVES TO HER AS SHE WAS COMING ALONG IN THE COACH
LEAVING DIXON IN CHARGE OF ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR PAYING BILLS DISPOSING OF FURNITURE AND SHUTTING UP THE HOUSE BEFORE THAT WEDNESDAY THAT MOURNFUL WEDNESDAY WHEN MISTER HALE WAS TO BE INTERRED
HER PASSIONATE DECLARATION THAT THERE WAS NOT A MAN IN ALL THAT VIOLENT AND DESPERATE CROWD FOR WHOM SHE DID NOT CARE AS MUCH AS FOR HIM AND AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER TAUNTING WORDS HIS BROW GREW STERN
HE WOULD FAIN DO YOU THE POOR GOOD OF ENDOWING YOU MATERIALLY AND THE OLD MAN HAS NOT A KNOWN RELATION ON EARTH WHO IS THERE TO MOURN FOR ADAM BELL AND HIS WHOLE HEART IS SET AND BENT UPON THIS ONE THING
MISSUS SHAW HUDDLED HERSELF UP IN HER SHAWL AND SHIVERED WHAT AN ICY ROOM SHE SAID THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR SOME TIME BEFORE MISSUS THORNTON ENTERED
THAT IF SHE COULD HAVE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER FORM OF ACCEPTANCE
AND THERE WAS NO TONE OF REGRET OR EMOTION OF ANY KIND IN THE VOICE WITH WHICH HE SAID GOOD BYE AND THE OFFERED HAND WAS TAKEN WITH A RESOLUTE CALMNESS
AND SHE SATE DOWN HASTILY AS IF AFRAID OF THINKING AND WROTE DEAR SIR THE ACCOMPANYING BOOK I AM SURE WILL BE VALUED BY YOU FOR THE SAKE OF MY FATHER TO WHOM IT BELONGED YOURS SINCERELY
THERE WILL HAVE TO BE A SALE SO SELECT WHAT THINGS YOU WISH RESERVED OR YOU CAN SEND A LIST AFTERWARDS NOW TWO THINGS MORE AND I HAVE DONE YOU KNOW OR IF YOU DON'T YOUR POOR FATHER DID
ALL THE DAY LONG SHE KEPT HERSELF FROM THINKING OF THE CEREMONY WHICH WAS GOING ON AT OXFORD
AT BREAKFAST TIME THE NEXT DAY SHE EXPRESSED HER WISH TO GO AND BID ONE OR TWO FRIENDS GOOD BYE MISSUS SHAW OBJECTED
SHE WAS SURE MARGARET WOULD NEVER REGAIN HER LOST STRENGTH WHILE SHE STAYED IN MILTON AND SHE HERSELF WAS AFRAID OF ONE OF HER OLD ATTACKS OF THE NERVES MARGARET MUST RETURN WITH HER AND THAT QUICKLY
INSTANTLY MARY'S GENEROSITY WAS KEENLY ALIVE
NOW TO MISSUS THORNTON'S THOUGHT SHE TO HERSELF IT MUST BE DONE
TEAR SWOLLEN FACE AND THE QUIVER IN THE VOICE WHICH MARGARET TRIED TO MAKE SO STEADY ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MY AUNT MISSUS SHAW I AM GOING AWAY FROM MILTON TO MORROW
THAT SHE HAD TO SUBMIT TO MUCH WATCHING AND PETTING AND SIGHING I TOLD YOU SO'S FROM HER AUNT DIXON SAID SHE WAS QUITE AS BAD AS SHE HAD BEEN ON THE FIRST DAY SHE HEARD OF HER FATHER'S DEATH
PROVED THAT IN SUCH A STATE AS MARGARET WAS IN FOOD WOULD ONLY CHOKE NOT NOURISH HER MISTER BELL GAVE A GREAT SIGH LIFTED UP HIS STOUT OLD LIMBS STIFF WITH TRAVELLING FROM THEIR EASY POSITION
I WAS KEPT BY THOSE WOMEN IN THE DRAWING ROOM MISSUS SHAW IS ANXIOUS TO GET HOME ON ACCOUNT OF HER DAUGHTER SHE SAYS
AND MAKE MY BOW TO HER AUNT AND GO OFF WITH YOU STRAIGHT
TOOK HIM TO HER SWEET PRESENCE EVERY STEP OF WHICH WAS RICH AS EACH RECURRING MOMENT THAT BORE HIM AWAY FROM HER MADE HIM RECALL SOME FRESH GRACE IN HER DEMEANOUR OR PLEASANT PUNGENCY IN HER CHARACTER YES
AND LIFE WITHOUT AN ATMOSPHERE OF EITHER HOPE OR FEAR MISSUS THORNTON AND FANNY WERE IN THE DINING ROOM THE LATTER IN A FLUTTER OF SMALL EXULTATION AS THE MAID HELD UP ONE GLOSSY MATERIAL AFTER ANOTHER
IF YOU DON'T LIKE SHOLTO TO BE SO LONG ABSENT FROM YOU EDITH I HOPE YOU WILL LET ME GO DOWN TO MILTON AND GIVE WHAT ASSISTANCE I CAN
AND I SHOULD HAVE PEOPLE GOING AND TALKING AND SPOILING THE SIMPLICITY OF THE WHOLE THING PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT ANY NEW PLAN YOU CAN'T HELP THAT MY ENEMIES IF I HAVE ANY MAY MAKE A PHILANTHROPIC FUSS ABOUT THIS DINNER SCHEME
BUT MORE FREQUENTLY PLANNING HOW SOON SHE COULD GET MARGARET AWAY FROM THAT HORRID PLACE AND BACK INTO THE PLEASANT COMFORTS OF HARLEY STREET OH DEAR SHE SAID TO HER MAID LOOK AT THOSE CHIMNEYS
BUT AFTER WIPING HER EYES AND STEADYING HER VOICE SHE MANAGED TO TELL MISTER BELL THAT MISSUS LENNOX WAS TOO NEAR HER CONFINEMENT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE ANY JOURNEY AT PRESENT WELL I SUPPOSE WE MUST HAVE MISSUS SHAW
HER MOTHER REALLY TRIED TO SYMPATHISE WITH HER BUT COULD NOT NEITHER TASTE NOR DRESS WERE IN HER LINE OF SUBJECTS AND SHE HEARTILY WISHED THAT FANNY HAD ACCEPTED HER BROTHER'S OFFER
THAT MISS HALE HAS APPEARED ALMOST FRIENDLESS AND HAS CERTAINLY HAD A GOOD DEAL OF ANXIETY TO BEAR BUT SHE DID NOT FEEL INTEREST ENOUGH IN THE ANSWER TO HER QUESTION TO WAIT FOR IT SHE LEFT THE ROOM TO MAKE HER HOUSEHOLD ARRANGEMENTS
MISTER THORNTON BEGAN TO THINK IT LONG FOR HE WAS FULL OF BUSINESS AND HAD HARDLY BEEN ABLE TO SPARE THE TIME FOR RUNNING UP TO CRAMPTON AND ENQUIRING HOW MISS HALE WAS
NEITHER LOSS OF FATHER NOR LOSS OF MOTHER DEAR AS SHE WAS TO MISTER THORNTON COULD HAVE POISONED THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE WEEKS THE DAYS THE HOURS WHEN A WALK OF TWO MILES EVERY STEP OF WHICH WAS PLEASANT
INTERESTING TIME BE MISTER BELL RESTRICTED HIMSELF TO COUGHING OVER THE END OF HIS SENTENCE SHE COULD BE CONTENT TO BE AT VENICE OR NAPLES OR SOME OF THOSE POPISH PLACES AT THE LAST INTERESTING TIME
AND ALMOST BREATHLESS BY HIM HE WOULD NOT LEAVE HER EVEN FOR THE DINNER WHICH DIXON HAD PREPARED FOR HIM DOWN STAIRS AND WITH SOBBING HOSPITALITY WOULD FAIN HAVE TEMPTED HIM TO EAT
THESE VISIONS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN DWELLING ON WITH COMPLACENCY IN HER CONVERSATION WITH MISSUS SHAW'S MAID SKILFULLY ELICITING MEANWHILE ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF STATE AND CONSEQUENCE CONNECTED WITH THE HARLEY STREET ESTABLISHMENT
HE DARED NOT ASK HER TO ACCOMPANY HIM BACK TO OXFORD WHICH HAD BEEN ONE OF THE PLANS HE HAD FORMED ON THE JOURNEY TO MILTON HER PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION WAS EVIDENTLY TOO COMPLETE FOR HER TO UNDERTAKE ANY SUCH FATIGUE
YOU MUST NOT GO TO THE CLARENDON WE HAVE FIVE OR SIX EMPTY BED ROOMS AT HOME WELL AIRED I THINK YOU MAY TRUST MY MOTHER FOR THAT THEN I'LL ONLY RUN UP STAIRS AND WISH THAT WAN GIRL GOOD NIGHT
I HOPE YOU HAVE A WHITE WAND I WAS VERY SCRUPULOUS AT FIRST IN CONFINING MYSELF TO THE MERE PURCHASING PART
IN VAIN URGED UPON HER TO TASTE SOME SWEETBREADS STEWED WITH OYSTERS SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH THE SAME QUIET OBSTINACY AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
SHE LAY ON THE SOFA WITH HER EYES SHUT NEVER SPEAKING BUT WHEN SPOKEN TO AND THEN REPLYING IN WHISPERS MISTER BELL WAS PERPLEXED HE DARED NOT LEAVE HER
HE HAD A PLATEFUL OF SOMETHING BROUGHT UP TO HIM IN GENERAL HE WAS PARTICULAR AND DAINTY ENOUGH AND KNEW WELL EACH SHADE OF FLAVOUR IN HIS FOOD BUT NOW THE DEVILLED CHICKEN TASTED LIKE SAWDUST
I WISH I WERE HER ONLY FRIEND MADAM I DARESAY IT SOUNDS VERY BRUTAL BUT HERE HAVE I BEEN DISPLACED AND TURNED OUT OF MY POST OF COMFORTER AND ADVISER BY A FINE LADY AUNT
IF IT DID NOT EXCEED THE LOVER IN HER ESTIMATION WHEN HER BROTHER AND MISTER BELL CAME IN FANNY BLUSHED AND SIMPERED AND FLUTTERED OVER THE SIGNS OF HER EMPLOYMENT IN A WAY WHICH COULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO DRAW ATTENTION FROM ANY ONE ELSE BUT MISTER BELL
IT HAD BEEN A ROYAL TIME OF LUXURY TO HIM WITH ALL ITS STINGS AND CONTUMELIES COMPARED TO THE POVERTY THAT CREPT ROUND AND CLIPPED THE ANTICIPATION OF THE FUTURE DOWN TO SORDID FACT
HE MINCED UP SOME OF THE FOWL FOR MARGARET AND PEPPERED AND SALTED IT WELL BUT WHEN DIXON FOLLOWING HIS DIRECTIONS TRIED TO FEED HER THE LANGUID SHAKE OF HEAD
SHE ASKED ABOUT AS BROKEN DOWN BY THIS LAST STROKE AS SHE CAN BE
BUT YOU ARE HARDLY ACQUAINTED WITH OUR DARKSHIRE FELLOWS FOR ALL YOU'RE A DARKSHIRE MAN YOURSELF THEY HAVE SUCH A SENSE OF HUMOUR AND SUCH A RACY MODE OF EXPRESSION
IS THAT YOU COME IN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU SO MISTER THORNTON WENT INTO THE STUDY AND DIXON HAD TO RETREAT INTO THE KITCHEN AND REINSTATE HERSELF IN HER OWN ESTEEM
I DID HOPE YOU HAD HAD NOBLENESS ENOUGH IN YOU TO MAKE YOU PAY HER THE HOMAGE OF THE HEART
THERE WAS A CRUEL FORCE IN THEIR CALM CERTAINTY WHICH THREATENED TO GRAPPLE AND CRUSH HER FLIMSY HOPES AND FANCIES
JERKING SENTENCES THAT HIS NAME WAS DOWLER THAT HE WAS GOING TO BATH ON PLEASURE THAT HE WAS FORMERLY IN THE ARMY THAT HE HAD NOW SET UP IN BUSINESS AS A GENTLEMAN THAT HE LIVED UPON THE PROFITS
THIS IS INDEED AN ACQUISITION
IT IS LONG VERY LONG MISTER PICKWICK SINCE YOU DRANK THE WATERS IT APPEARS AN AGE MISTER PICKWICK RE MARKABLE SUCH WERE THE EXPRESSIONS WITH WHICH ANGELO CYRUS BANTAM ESQUIRE M C TOOK MISTER PICKWICK'S HAND
HE WAS BUTTONED UP TO THE CHIN IN A BROWN COAT AND HAD A LARGE SEALSKIN TRAVELLING CAP AND A GREATCOAT AND CLOAK LYING ON THE SEAT BESIDE HIM
ADAM PAUSED AND LOOKED AT HETTY WHO WAS PLUCKING THE LEAVES FROM THE FILBERT TREES AND TEARING THEM UP IN HER HAND HER LITTLE PLANS AND PRECONCERTED SPEECHES HAD ALL FORSAKEN HER LIKE AN ILL LEARNT LESSON UNDER THE TERRIBLE AGITATION PRODUCED BY ADAM'S WORDS
TO MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY AT WHICH MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY WOULD SHRUG UP HER SHOULDERS AND COUGH AS MUCH AS TO SAY SHE WONDERED WHETHER HE EVER WOULD BEGIN
WHEN SAM WELLER CAME UP TO HIS MASTER AND WHISPERING IN HIS EAR BEGGED TO SPEAK TO HIM WITH AN AIR OF THE DEEPEST MYSTERY WELL SAM SAID MISTER PICKWICK WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW HERE'S RAYTHER A RUM GO SIR REPLIED SAM WHAT INQUIRED MISTER PICKWICK
WHY MISTER PICKWICK HAD NOT RETURNED THAT DIAMOND OR LED THE CLUB OR ROUGHED THE SPADE OR FINESSED THE HEART OR LED THROUGH THE HONOUR OR BROUGHT OUT THE ACE OR PLAYED UP TO THE KING OR SOME SUCH THING
INTO THE TEA ROOM MISTER PICKWICK TURNED AND CATCHING SIGHT OF HIM MISTER BANTAM CORKSCREWED HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD AND WELCOMED HIM WITH ECSTASY MY DEAR SIR I AM HIGHLY HONOURED
LOW AND GENTLE BUT VERY PLEASANT TO HEAR IN A FEMALE VOICE WHETHER IN BATH OR ELSEWHERE
WALKED BACK TO THE GEORGE AND VULTURE WHERE HE WAS PRETTY BUSILY EMPLOYED UNTIL BED TIME IN REDUCING CLOTHES AND LINEN INTO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE COMPASS AND EXERTING HIS MECHANICAL GENIUS IN CONSTRUCTING A VARIETY OF INGENIOUS DEVICES FOR KEEPING THE LIDS ON BOXES WHICH HAD NEITHER LOCKS NOR HINGES
NOT DANCING BECAUSE THERE WERE NO PARTNERS FOR THEM AND NOT PLAYING CARDS LEST THEY SHOULD BE SET DOWN AS IRRETRIEVABLY SINGLE WERE IN THE FAVOURABLE SITUATION OF BEING ABLE TO ABUSE EVERYBODY WITHOUT REFLECTING ON THEMSELVES IN SHORT THEY COULD ABUSE EVERYBODY BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS THERE
AN INSTANCE OF CONDESCENSION AT WHICH ANGELO BANTAM WAS EVEN MORE OVERPOWERED THAN BEFORE TICKETS OF ADMISSION TO THAT EVENING'S ASSEMBLY WERE TO HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR THE WHOLE PARTY BUT AS THEY WERE NOT READY MISTER PICKWICK UNDERTOOK DESPITE ALL THE PROTESTATIONS TO THE CONTRARY OF ANGELO BANTAM
DRESSES RUSTLED FEATHERS WAVED LIGHTS SHONE AND JEWELS SPARKLED THERE WAS THE MUSIC NOT OF THE QUADRILLE BAND FOR IT HAD NOT YET COMMENCED
THIS HERE SIR REJOINED SAM
AND IN REPLY TO ALL THESE GRAVE CHARGES MISTER PICKWICK WOULD BE WHOLLY UNABLE TO PLEAD ANY JUSTIFICATION WHATEVER HAVING BY THIS TIME FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE GAME PEOPLE CAME AND LOOKED ON TOO WHICH MADE MISTER PICKWICK NERVOUS
HOW IS THAT SAM SAID MISTER PICKWICK AREN'T THE NAMES DOWN ON THE WAY BILL THE NAMES IS NOT ONLY DOWN ON THE VAY BILL SIR REPLIED SAM BUT THEY'VE PAINTED VUN ON EM UP
YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT NOT TO READ IT JUST YET SAID ADAM READ IT WHEN YOU'RE BY YOURSELF BUT STAY OUT A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND LET US CALL THE CHILDREN YOU LOOK SO WHITE AND ILL YOUR AUNT MAY TAKE NOTICE OF IT HETTY HEARD THE WARNING
YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO OBSERVE THAT THIS IS A VERY UNNECESSARY DISPLAY OF EXCITEMENT I HAVE ONLY TAKEN PLACES INSIDE FOR TWO I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID THE FIERCE MAN I WITHDRAW MY EXPRESSIONS
THE CARDS WERE AGAINST HIM ALSO AND WHEN THEY LEFT OFF AT TEN MINUTES PAST ELEVEN MISS BOLO ROSE FROM THE TABLE CONSIDERABLY AGITATED AND WENT STRAIGHT HOME IN A FLOOD OF TEARS AND A SEDAN CHAIR
YOU'RE A SWEET PET MY LOVE REPLIED MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY TAPPING HER DAUGHTER'S CHEEK WITH HER FAN AND ARE ALWAYS TO BE TRUSTED HE'S IMMENSELY RICH MY DEAR BLESS YOU WITH THESE WORDS MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY KISSED HER ELDEST DAUGHTER MOST AFFECTIONATELY
MISTER PICKWICK LADY SNUPHANUPH MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY MISS BOLO MISTER PICKWICK BOWED TO EACH OF THE LADIES AND FINDING ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE CUT MISTER PICKWICK AND MISS BOLO AGAINST LADY SNUPHANUPH AND MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY
AND AN OLD ONE BEHIND WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH FARMING THERE WAS A CONSTANT SUCCESSION OF CHRISTIAN NAMES IN SMOCK FROCKS AND WHITE COATS WHO WERE INVITED TO HAVE A LIFT BY THE GUARD AND WHO KNEW EVERY HORSE AND HOSTLER ON THE ROAD AND OFF IT AND THERE WAS A DINNER
BUT THE DETERMINATION TO CONCEAL WHAT SHE FELT STILL GOVERNED HER IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A BLIND PROMPTING NOW FOR SHE WAS UNABLE TO CALCULATE THE EFFECT OF HER WORDS YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO SAY AS I LOVE HIM SHE SAID FAINTLY BUT IMPETUOUSLY PLUCKING ANOTHER ROUGH LEAF AND TEARING IT UP
YOU DON'T SAY SO SAID MISTER PICKWICK YES YOU'LL HEAR HIS VOICE IN A MOMENT MISTER PICKWICK
NO NOT ALL OF YOU SAID THE STRANGE MAN EMPHATICALLY I'VE TAKEN TWO PLACES IF THEY TRY TO SQUEEZE SIX PEOPLE INTO AN INFERNAL BOX THAT ONLY HOLDS FOUR I'LL TAKE A POST CHAISE AND BRING AN ACTION I'VE PAID MY FARE IT WON'T DO
IF HE PLAYED A WRONG CARD MISS BOLO LOOKED A SMALL ARMOURY OF DAGGERS IF HE STOPPED TO CONSIDER WHICH WAS THE RIGHT ONE LADY SNUPHANUPH WOULD THROW HERSELF BACK IN HER CHAIR AND SMILE WITH A MINGLED GLANCE OF IMPATIENCE AND PITY
WHICH WAS INSTANTANEOUSLY ANSWERED BY A POWDERED HEADED FOOTMAN IN GORGEOUS LIVERY AND OF SYMMETRICAL STATURE IS THIS HERE MISTER BANTAM'S OLD FELLER
OPPOSITE THE GREAT PUMP ROOM BATH WHERE THE WAITERS FROM THEIR COSTUME MIGHT BE MISTAKEN FOR WESTMINSTER BOYS ONLY THEY DESTROY THE ILLUSION BY BEHAVING THEMSELVES MUCH BETTER BREAKFAST HAD SCARCELY BEEN CLEARED AWAY ON THE SUCCEEDING MORNING WHEN A WAITER BROUGHT IN MISTER DOWLER'S CARD
THAT ADAM MIGHT BETRAY WHAT HE KNEW TO HER UNCLE AND AUNT AND HIS SUDDEN PROPOSITION TO TALK WITH HER ALONE HAD SET HER THOUGHTS TO WORK IN A NEW WAY
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEAP AT HALF A CROWN A MOUTH IF ANY MODERATE NUMBER OF MOUTHS COULD HAVE EATEN IT IN THE TIME AND AT SEVEN O'CLOCK P M MISTER PICKWICK AND HIS FRIENDS AND MISTER DOWLER AND HIS WIFE RESPECTIVELY RETIRED TO THEIR PRIVATE SITTING ROOMS AT THE WHITE HART HOTEL
AND MISTER CRUSHTON HAD BEEN REFLECTING WHAT SUBJECT HIS LORDSHIP COULD TALK ABOUT BEST
PALPABLE SPRING INDEED OR THE INDICATIONS OF IT I AM SITTING IN BRIGHT SUNSHINE AT THE EDGE OF THE CREEK THE SURFACE JUST RIPPLED BY THE WIND ALL IS SOLITUDE MORNING FRESHNESS NEGLIGENCE
HE LIVED SIMPLY AND ECONOMICALLY BUT QUITE WELL WAS ALWAYS CHEERY AND COURTEOUS PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY A LITTLE BLUNT HAVING VERY POSITIVE OPINIONS UPON POLITICS RELIGION AND SO FORTH
IN ALL DIRECTIONS OVERHEAD THROUGH WHICH THE SUN BEAM'D AN INDESCRIBABLE UTTERANCE OF COLOR AND LIGHT SO GORGEOUS YET SO SOFT SUCH AS I HAD NEVER WITNESS'D BEFORE THEN ITS CONTINUANCE
TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO HIS REGIMENT BUT IN REALITY HE DID NOT HIMSELF KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THAT HALF HOUR TO THE TROOPS ENTRUSTED TO HIM AND COULD NOT SAY WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER THE ATTACK HAD BEEN REPULSED OR HIS REGIMENT HAD BEEN BROKEN UP
AT ONE OF OUR INTERVIEWS HE GAVE ME A MINUTE ACCOUNT OF PAINE'S SICKNESS AND DEATH IN SHORT FROM THOSE TALKS I WAS AND AM SATISFIED THAT MY OLD FRIEND WITH HIS MARK'D ADVANTAGES HAD MENTALLY MORALLY AND EMOTIONALLY GAUGED THE AUTHOR
HE REPORTED THAT HIS REGIMENT HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY FRENCH CAVALRY AND THAT THOUGH THE ATTACK HAD BEEN REPULSED HE HAD LOST MORE THAN HALF HIS MEN HE SAID THE ATTACK HAD BEEN REPULSED EMPLOYING THIS MILITARY TERM
THE NEARER THEY GOT TO THE HOLLOW THE LESS THEY COULD SEE BUT THE MORE THEY FELT THE NEARNESS OF THE ACTUAL BATTLEFIELD THEY BEGAN TO MEET WOUNDED MEN ONE WITH A BLEEDING HEAD AND NO CAP WAS BEING DRAGGED ALONG BY TWO SOLDIERS
I AM SURE OF IT OF THE FOUL AND FOOLISH FICTIONS YET TOLD ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DECEASE THE ABSOLUTE FACT IS THAT AS HE LIVED A GOOD LIFE AFTER ITS KIND HE DIED CALMLY AND PHILOSOPHICALLY AS BECAME HIM
OR RECEIVING AND DISCUSSING THE RESULT IN THIS SECLUDED PLACE UNCARED FOR UNKNOWN CROWS AND CROWS
STANDING ON END FEBRUARY TWENTY A SOLITARY AND PLEASANT SUNDOWN HOUR AT THE POND EXERCISING ARMS CHEST MY WHOLE BODY
AND MUSKET SHOTS SOUNDED SEVERAL OF OUR MEN FELL AMONG THEM THE ROUND FACED OFFICER WHO HAD MARCHED SO GAILY AND COMPLACENTLY BUT AT THE MOMENT THE FIRST REPORT WAS HEARD BAGRATION LOOKED ROUND AND SHOUTED
THE SOIL THE SOIL TOO LET OTHERS PEN AND INK THE SEA THE AIR AS I SOMETIMES TRY BUT NOW I FEEL TO CHOOSE THE COMMON SOIL FOR THEME NAUGHT ELSE
AND CERTAINLY HIS LATER YEARS VERY FREQUENT COMPANION A REMARKABLY FINE OLD MAN COLONEL FELLOWS WHO MAY YET BE REMEMBER'D BY SOME STRAY RELICS OF THAT PERIOD AND SPOT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL FIRST GIVE
A MOROSE SOLDIER MARCHING ON THE LEFT TURNED HIS EYES ON BAGRATION AS HE SHOUTED WITH AN EXPRESSION THAT SEEMED TO SAY WE KNOW THAT OURSELVES ANOTHER WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND AS THOUGH FEARING TO RELAX
AND THE INSTINCTS OF ABSOLUTE JUSTICE REMAIN'D VITAL ANYWHERE ABOUT NEW YORK CITY HALL OR TAMMANY THEY WERE TO BE FOUND IN COLONEL FELLOWS HE LIKED YOUNG MEN AND ENJOY'D TO LEISURELY TALK WITH THEM OVER A SOCIAL GLASS OF TODDY AFTER HIS DAY'S WORK
AS I SIT A MOMENT WRITING THIS BY THE BANK I SEE THE BLACK CLEAR CUT REFLECTION OF THEM FAR BELOW FLYING THROUGH THE WATERY LOOKING GLASS BY ONES TWOS OR LONG STRINGS
PIERS SURFACES ROOFS SHIPPING MANTLED WITH SNOW A FAINT WINTER VAPOR HUNG A FITTING ACCOMPANIMENT AROUND AND OVER THE ENDLESS WHITISH SPREAD AND GAVE IT JUST A TINGE
WITH A STUPID AND HAPPY EXPRESSION THE SAME MAN WHO HAD RUSHED OUT OF THE WATTLE SHED AT THAT MOMENT HE WAS CLEARLY THINKING OF NOTHING BUT HOW DASHING A FELLOW HE WOULD APPEAR AS HE PASSED THE COMMANDER
THE DEAD LEAVES THE INCIPIENT GRASS AND THE LATENT LIFE UNDERNEATH THE EFFORT TO START SOMETHING ALREADY IN SHELTER'D SPOTS SOME LITTLE FLOWERS THE DISTANT EMERALD SHOW OF WINTER WHEAT AND THE RYE FIELDS
DOMINATING THE ESTHETIC AND SOUL SENSES SUMPTUOUSLY TENDERLY FULL I END THIS NOTE BY THE POND JUST LIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE THROUGH THE EVENING SHADOWS THE WESTERN REFLECTIONS
WITH THE SELF SATISFACTION OF A MAN ON PARADE HE STEPPED LIGHTLY WITH HIS MUSCULAR LEGS AS IF SAILING ALONG STRETCHING HIMSELF TO HIS FULL HEIGHT WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EFFORT HIS EASE CONTRASTING
IN ITS WATER MIRROR SURFACE WITH INVERTED FIGURES OF TREES I HEAR NOW AND THEN THE FLUP OF A PIKE LEAPING OUT AND RIPPLING THE WATER THE GATES OPENING APRIL SIXTH
THAT HE LABOR'D WELL AND WISELY FOR THE STATES IN THE TRYING PERIOD OF THEIR PARTURITION AND IN THE SEEDS OF THEIR CHARACTER THERE SEEMS TO ME NO QUESTION I DARE NOT SAY HOW MUCH OF WHAT OUR UNION IS OWNING AND ENJOYING TO DAY
LAST NIGHT AND TO DAY RAINY AND THICK TILL MID AFTERNOON WHEN THE WIND CHOPP'D ROUND THE CLOUDS SWIFTLY DREW OFF LIKE CURTAINS THE CLEAR APPEAR'D AND WITH IT THE FAIREST GRANDEST
HE ORDERED HIM TO BRING DOWN THE TWO BATTALIONS OF THE SIXTH CHASSEURS WHOM THEY HAD JUST PASSED PRINCE ANDREW WAS STRUCK BY THE CHANGED EXPRESSION ON PRINCE BAGRATION'S FACE AT THIS MOMENT IT EXPRESSED THE CONCENTRATED
NAY IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THERE IS SOME VITAL UNSEEN PRESENCE AN AFTERNOON SCENE FEBRUARY TWENTY TWO
DO IT YOURSELF SAID SAUNDERS I DON'T MIND HELPING YOU WITH GUINEA PIGS OCCASIONALLY WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE LEARNED PARTLY BECAUSE I DON'T FEAR A GUINEA PIG'S REVENGE THIS THING'S DIFFERENT ALL RIGHT YOU MISERABLE SKUNK I WON'T FORGET THE WAY YOU'VE STOOD BY ME
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD A WONDERFUL WAY WITH YOU IN DEALING WITH SERVANTS YOU MUSTN'T LET POOR OLD MERRIT GO OF COURSE SHE SHAN'T GO SAID SAUNDERS SHE'S PROBABLY ONLY ANGLING FOR A RISE IN SALARY
AND I THOUGHT IT WANTED FOOD SO I TOOK OUT THE BOX SIR AND GOT A CAGE AND WAS GOING TO TRANSFER IT WHEN THE ANIMAL GOT AWAY WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT I NEVER WROTE ANY SUCH NOTE
EUSTACE BORLSOVER WOULD NOT LEAVE HIS ROOM BUT HE THOUGHT THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN SAUNDERS'S SUGGESTION TO LEAVE BRIGHTON WITHOUT NOTICE HE BEGAN RAPIDLY TO REGAIN HIS STRENGTH
WILL ELEVEN O'CLOCK TO NIGHT BE SUITABLE FOR OUR LAST APPOINTMENT WHO IS IT FROM ASKED BORLSOVER IT WAS MEANT FOR ME SAID SAUNDERS THERE'S NO ANSWER MISSUS PRINCE AND HE PUT THE PAPER INTO HIS POCKET A DUNNING LETTER FROM A TAILOR
WE'LL KEEP IT THERE TILL IT DIES HE SAID MAY I BURN IN HELL IF I EVER OPEN THE DOOR OF THAT SAFE AGAIN MISSUS MERRIT DEPARTED AT THE END OF THE MONTH HER SUCCESSOR CERTAINLY WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE SERVANTS
THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY AND OPENED THE DESK THE BOX WAS AS THEY HAD LEFT IT ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ASKED EUSTACE I AM WAITING FOR YOU TO VOLUNTEER TO OPEN THE LID
I'LL WIRE TO YOU THERE AT THE CROWN TO TELL YOU THE BRIGHTON ADDRESS THE HOUSE HE CHOSE AT BRIGHTON WAS IN A TERRACE HE HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE IT WAS KEPT BY HIS OLD COLLEGE GYP A MAN OF DISCREET SILENCE
SHE TOOK HER HANDS OUT OF THE WATER AND WAS DRYING THEM ABSENT MINDED LIKE ON THE ROLLER TOWEL WHEN SHE FOUND THAT SHE WAS DRYING SOMEONE ELSE'S HAND AS WELL ONLY COLDER THAN HERS WHAT NONSENSE EXCLAIMED SAUNDERS EXACTLY SIR
THEN THAT GIRL EMMA LAIDLAW LEFT THE DOOR OPEN WHEN SHE WAS CLEANING AND I THINK IT MUST HAVE ESCAPED AND YOU THINK IT WAS THE ANIMAL THAT'S BEEN FRIGHTENING THE MAIDS WELL NO SIR NOT QUITE THEY SAID IT WAS YOU'LL EXCUSE ME SIR
I'VE GOT IT AT LAST HE SAID IN A TONE OF TRIUMPH GOOD LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT IT NOT WHEN IT'S LOOSE GET ME SOME NAILS AND A HAMMER AND A BOARD OF SOME SORT CAN YOU HOLD IT ALL RIGHT YES THE THING'S QUITE LIMP
AND YOU OPENED THE DESK YES SIR AND AS I WAS GETTING THE CAGE READY THE ANIMAL HOPPED OUT WHAT ANIMAL THE ANIMAL INSIDE THE BOX SIR WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE
AND WRAPPED THE BOARD IN IT NOW GET THE KEYS FROM MY POCKET AND OPEN THE SAFE CHUCK THE OTHER THINGS OUT OH LORD IT'S GETTING ITSELF INTO FRIGHTFUL KNOTS AND OPEN IT QUICK HE THREW THE THING IN AND BANGED THE DOOR
THEN YOU'RE LUCKY IN GETTING OFF SO EASILY SIR THE MAN REPLIED BY THE WAY THEY HAVE GONE ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS I SHOULD SAY THEY WERE EXPERIENCED CRACKSMEN THEY MUST HAVE CAUGHT THE ALARM WHEN THEY WERE JUST BEGINNING THEIR EVENING'S WORK YES SAID EUSTACE
NO THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A PERSONAL INTERVIEW WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF TOWN WE'LL GO BACK TO MORROW AND YOU MUST WORK YOUR COLD FOR ALL IT'S WORTH DON'T FORGET THAT IT'S GOT ON TO THE CHEST AND WILL REQUIRE WEEKS OF FEEDING UP AND NURSING
WHICH HE CLOSED WITH A BANG FRIGHTENED BY THE NOISE THE PARROT SHOOK ITS WINGS PREPARATORY TO FLIGHT AND AS IT DID SO THE FINGERS OF THE HAND GOT HOLD OF IT BY THE THROAT THERE WAS A SHRILL SCREAM FROM PETER AS HE FLUTTERED ACROSS THE ROOM
BY AN EXCELLENT COOK THE ROOMS WERE ON THE FIRST FLOOR THE TWO BEDROOMS WERE AT THE BACK AND OPENED OUT OF EACH OTHER SAUNDERS CAN HAVE THE SMALLER ONE THOUGH IT IS THE ONLY ONE WITH A FIREPLACE HE SAID I'LL STICK TO THE LARGER OF THE TWO
I WAS GOING TO MENTION IT MYSELF I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE SIR WHEN I FOUND YOUR NOTE ASKING ME TO OPEN THAT DESK AND TAKE OUT THE BOX WITH THE RAT I BROKE THE LOCK AS YOU TOLD ME AND WAS GLAD TO DO IT BECAUSE I COULD HEAR THE ANIMAL IN THE BOX MAKING A GREAT NOISE
SEND MISTER SAUNDERS HERE AT ONCE HE SAID TO THE MAID WHO CAME IN ANSWER TO THE BELL TELL HIM I WANT HIM IMMEDIATELY THEN HE WENT WITH THE HAND TO THE FIRE THERE WAS A RAGGED GASH ACROSS THE BACK WHERE THE BIRD'S BEAK HAD TORN IT
BUT AT THE TIME HE THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING BLACK AND CHARRED WAS CREEPING SLOWLY VERY SLOWLY FROM THE MASS OF FLAMES TOWARDS EUSTACE BORLSOVER FOR A MOMENT HE THOUGHT OF RETURNING TO HIS FRIEND
WHEN ONCE AT LIBERTY PETER WOULD SHOW NO INCLINATION TO RETURN AND WOULD OFTEN BE ABOUT THE HOUSE FOR DAYS NOW AFTER SIX CONSECUTIVE WEEKS OF CAPTIVITY PETER HAD AGAIN DISCOVERED A NEW MEANS OF UNLOOSING HIS BOLTS AND WAS AT LARGE
I'VE HAD TIME TO SMOKE ONE CIGARETTE ALREADY IT'S BAD TO KEEP AN INVALID WAITING THERE'S ONLY ONE POSSIBLE THING FOR YOU TO DO WHAT WAS THAT THE IVY BLOWING AGAINST THE WINDOW THERE IT'S YOUR MOVE NOW EUSTACE
I SUPPOSE HE MUST HAVE GOT WIND OF OUR LEAVING IT WAS A CLEVER LIE AND EUSTACE ASKED NO MORE QUESTIONS THEY WENT ON WITH THEIR GAME
AND PREPARE A LITTLE BODY FOR IT NOW IT'S GOT INTO THAT LITTLE BODY AND IS OFF ON ITS OWN WELL WHAT ARE WE TO DO WE'LL KEEP OUR EYES OPEN SAID SAUNDERS AND TRY TO CATCH IT IF WE CAN'T DO THAT
IT'S YOUR AFFAIR THOUGH MISSUS MERRIT IF I UNDERSTAND IT GIVES A MONTH'S NOTICE OH THAT'S QUITE ABSURD ON MISSUS MERRIT'S PART SAUNDERS REPLIED SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT LET'S SEE WHAT SHE SAYS
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HER BUT WE COULDN'T GET HER TO STOP YOU DON'T BELIEVE ALL THIS SAID EUSTACE TURNING SUDDENLY TOWARDS THE BUTLER ME SIR OH NO SIR I'VE NOT SEEN ANYTHING NOR HEARD ANYTHING
BUT WHEN I CAME AWAY I SAW ONE OR TWO OF THEM LYING UNDER THE TREES AS THEY PROCEEDED THE TORCH THREW A GLOOMY LIGHT UPON THE GROUND AND FAR AMONG THE RECESSES OF THE WOODS
HE WAS IMPATIENT TO SECURE HER AGAIN UNDER HIS ROOF AND HAD COMMISSIONED UGO TO ASSIST BERTRAND IN GUARDING HER BACK TO THE CASTLE THUS COMPELLED TO RETURN EMILY BADE THE KIND MADDELINA FAREWELL WITH REGRET
HOWEVER SOFTENED BY A CONJECTURE THAT VALANCOURT WAS THERE AND SHE FOUND SOME DEGREE OF COMFORT IN THE THOUGHT OF BEING NEAR HIM NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONSIDERATION THAT HE WAS PROBABLY A PRISONER
IT SURELY CAME FROM THE RAMPARTS ABOVE AND ON LOOKING UP THEY PERCEIVED A LIGHT MOVING ALONG THE WALLS WHILE IN THE NEXT INSTANT THE BREEZE SWELLING THE VOICE SOUNDED LOUDER THAN BEFORE
FOR BESIDES THE CANNON FROM THE WALLS OUR ARCHERS ON THE TWO ROUND TOWERS SHOWERED DOWN UPON THEM AT SUCH A RATE THAT BY HOLY PETER THERE WAS NO STANDING IT I NEVER SAW A BETTER SIGHT IN MY LIFE
AS HE GAVE ME THE PICTURE THAT THIS HAS BEEN MY COMPANION AND ONLY SOLACE IN ALL MY MISFORTUNES TELL HER THAT I HAVE WORN IT NEXT MY HEART AND THAT I SENT IT HER AS THE PLEDGE OF AN AFFECTION WHICH CAN NEVER DIE
BUT UPON EMILY'S EARNEST ENTREATIES THAT THEY WOULD PROCEED BERTRAND UTTERING SOME JOKE UPON THE UNFORTUNATE PERSON TO WHOM IT HAD BELONGED THREW IT HARD UPON THE GROUND AND THEY PASSED ON
BRING THE LIGHT HITHER SAID BERTRAND I HAVE STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING THAT RATTLES LOUD ENOUGH
LUDOVICO HAVING PROMISED TO ACCOMPANY ANNETTE TO THE CORRIDOR IN THE EVENING WHERE AFTER SEVERAL HOURS IMPATIENTLY COUNTED HE ARRIVED EMILY HAVING THEN UTTERED THE NAME OF VALANCOURT COULD ARTICULATE NO MORE
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROVISION FOR HERSELF AND VALANCOURT FOR LIFE THREW ONLY A LIGHT AND TRANSIENT SHADE UPON HER SPIRITS THE IDEA OF VALANCOURT AND THAT SHE SHOULD SEE HIM SO SOON ALONE OCCUPIED HER HEART
ALMOST EQUAL TO A PROOF ARRESTED THE COUNT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ACCUSATION AND WITHOUT EVEN HINTING TO HIM HIS CRIME THREW HIM INTO ONE OF THOSE SECRET PRISONS WHICH WERE THE TERROR OF THE VENETIANS
AND BRANCHES OF THE TREES THAT HAD SO LATELY ADORNED IT AND SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN A SPOT PARTICULARLY FATAL TO THE BESIEGERS FOR IT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TREES
WHO THE ENEMY WAS THAT HAD OCCASIONED HIM THIS CALAMITY HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GUESS UNLESS INDEED IT WAS MONTONI ON WHOM HIS SUSPICIONS RESTED AND NOT ONLY WITH MUCH APPARENT PROBABILITY
WITHOUT EXPERIENCING SOMEWHAT OF THE JOY OF HOPE THEY CONTINUED TO WIND ALONG THE VALLEY AND SOON AFTER SHE SAW AGAIN THE OLD WALLS AND MOON LIT TOWERS RISING OVER THE WOODS
THEY PERCEIVED A STEEL BREASTPLATE ON THE GROUND WHICH BERTRAND RAISED AND THEY SAW THAT IT WAS PIERCED THROUGH AND THAT THE LINING WAS ENTIRELY COVERED WITH BLOOD
AND TO BEG YOU WOULD ALLOW HIM TO VISIT YOU THIS NIGHT IF IT WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT FOR THAT HE COULD NO LONGER LIVE UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITHOUT SEEING YOU THE HOUR HE SAID HE COULD NOT MENTION FOR IT MUST DEPEND ON CIRCUMSTANCES
AND SHE FOUND HERSELF ONCE MORE BENEATH THE GLOOMY ARCH AND HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE THAT SEEMED TO SHUT HER FROM THE WORLD FOR EVER IN THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS IN THE FIRST COURT OF THE CASTLE
AND THE TOWER TOO THE ROAD WINDING ROUND THE BASE OF A MOUNTAIN THEY NOW CAME WITHIN VIEW OF THE CASTLE WHICH WAS SHEWN IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE VALLEY BY A GLEAM OF MOON SHINE AND THEN VANISHED IN SHADE
WHEN CAN YOU SEE THE CHEVALIER AGAIN THAT IS UNCERTAIN SIGNORA REPLIED HE
AND THEN A TRUMPET SOUNDED OF WHICH EMILY ENQUIRED THE OCCASION O THEY ARE ONLY CHANGING WATCH REPLIED UGO I DO NOT REMEMBER THIS TRUMPET
WHEN UDOLPHO WAS ONCE MORE LEFT TO THE QUIET POSSESSION OF MONTONI HE DISPATCHED UGO INTO TUSCANY FOR EMILY WHOM HE HAD SENT FROM CONSIDERATIONS OF HER PERSONAL SAFETY
SAID ANNETTE AND LOOKED IMPATIENTLY AT LUDOVICO WHO UNDERSTOOD HER LOOK AND REPLIED TO EMILY YES LADY THE CHEVALIER DOES INDEED REMEMBER YOU AND I AM SURE HAS A VERY GREAT REGARD FOR YOU
BUT IT SHONE ONLY AT INTERVALS FOR THE NIGHT WAS CLOUDY AND LIGHTED BY THE TORCH WHICH UGO CARRIED THE TRAVELLERS PACED SILENTLY ALONG EMILY MUSING ON HER SITUATION AND BERTRAND AND UGO ANTICIPATING
REPLIED THE SOLDIER WHAT MY OLD COMRADE CRIED UGO DON'T YOU KNOW ME NOT KNOW UGO I HAVE BROUGHT HOME A PRISONER HERE BOUND HAND AND FOOT A FELLOW WHO HAS BEEN DRINKING TUSCANY WINE
THAT EXTENDED AT THEIR FEET AND TO THE DISTANT MEDITERRANEAN WHOSE WAVES SHE HAD SO OFTEN WISHED WOULD BEAR HER BACK TO FRANCE THE DISTRESS SHE FELT ON HER RETURN TOWARDS THE PLACE OF HER FORMER SUFFERINGS WAS
IN DOUBTFUL JOY AND TENDERNESS AND WHEN THE STRAIN CEASED SHE CONSIDERED IT AS A SIGNAL THAT VALANCOURT WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE PRISON SOON AFTER SHE HEARD STEPS IN THE CORRIDOR THEY WERE THE LIGHT
HIS CASTLE WAS BESIEGED BY TROOPS WHO SEEMED WILLING TO DARE EVERY THING AND TO SUFFER PATIENTLY ANY HARDSHIPS IN PURSUIT OF VICTORY THE STRENGTH OF THE FORTRESS HOWEVER WITHSTOOD THEIR ATTACK
AN IDEAL SUPERNAL ONE IT IS GOD GOD IS SPIRIT
THE FIGHT AGAINST REASON THE FAIREST PART OF CHILDHOOD PASSES WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF COMING TO BLOWS WITH REASON WE CARE NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT IT DO NOT MEDDLE WITH IT ADMIT NO REASON
WILL IT IS TO BE HOPED BECOME CLEAR AS WE GO ON LET US TAKE UP THE INHERITANCE LEFT BY THE ANCIENTS AND AS ACTIVE WORKMEN DO WITH IT AS MUCH AS CAN BE DONE WITH IT
THE HEAVENLY THE ATTITUDE IS NOW ALTOGETHER REVERSED THE YOUTH TAKES UP AN INTELLECTUAL POSITION WHILE THE BOY WHO DID NOT YET FEEL HIMSELF AS MIND
SO LONG IT IS ONLY THOUGHTS THAT ONE HAS IDEAS THAT HE HOPES TO BE ABLE TO REALIZE SOME DAY WHEN HE HAS FOUND A SPHERE OF ACTION THUS ONE HAS MEANWHILE ONLY IDEALS
THE WORLD LIES DESPISED AT OUR FEET FAR BENEATH US AND OUR HEAVEN INTO WHICH ITS MIGHTY ARMS ARE NO LONGER THRUST AND ITS STUPEFYING BREATH DOES NOT COME SEDUCTIVELY AS IT MAY POSE
THOUGH HE DOES NOT THEREFORE HESITATE TO ASCERTAIN IN AN INDIVIDUAL CASE
AND THE MORE WE FEEL OURSELVES THE SMALLER APPEARS THAT WHICH BEFORE SEEMED INVINCIBLE AND WHAT IS OUR TRICKERY SHREWDNESS COURAGE OBDURACY WHAT ELSE BUT
I REFER ALL TO MYSELF IF AS SPIRIT I HAD THRUST AWAY THE WORLD IN THE DEEPEST CONTEMPT SO AS OWNER I THRUST SPIRITS OR IDEAS AWAY INTO THEIR VANITY
THE SPIRIT WANTS TO SPREAD OUT SO AS TO FOUND ITS EMPIRE AN EMPIRE THAT IS NOT OF THIS WORLD THE WORLD JUST CONQUERED THUS THEN IT LONGS TO BECOME ALL IN ALL TO ITSELF
FOR THE ANCIENTS HAD ACCOMPLISHED THAT BUT BACK OF THE GOD WHOM THE ANCIENTS BEQUEATHED TO THEM BACK OF THE GOD WHO IS SPIRIT BACK OF EVERYTHING THAT IS THE SPIRIT'S THE SPIRITUAL
AND FEELS THAT ALL THE VALUE OF HIS EXISTENCE CONSISTS IN BEING SPIRIT IT BECOMES EASY FOR THE YOUTH TO GIVE HIS LIFE THE BODILY LIFE FOR A NOTHING
THE SULTAN HAS SET HIS CAUSE ON NOTHING BUT HIMSELF HE IS TO HIMSELF ALL IN ALL HE IS TO HIMSELF THE ONLY ONE AND TOLERATES NOBODY WHO WOULD DARE NOT TO BE ONE OF HIS PEOPLE
THE MODERNS NEVER DID NOR DO MAKE THEIR WAY FURTHER
FATHERLAND AND SO ON THEREFORE THE MAN SHOWS A SECOND SELF DISCOVERY THE YOUTH FOUND HIMSELF AS SPIRIT AND LOST HIMSELF AGAIN IN THE GENERAL SPIRIT THE COMPLETE
BUT THE ACTIVITY OF THE SPIRIT WHICH SEARCHES EVEN THE DEPTHS OF THE GODHEAD IS THEOLOGY IF THE ANCIENTS HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW BUT WISDOM OF THE WORLD
THE COMBAT OF SELF ASSERTION IS UNAVOIDABLE VICTORY OR DEFEAT BETWEEN THE TWO ALTERNATIVES THE FATE OF THE COMBAT WAVERS THE VICTOR BECOMES THE LORD
AS I FIND MYSELF BACK OF THINGS AND THAT AS MIND SO I MUST LATER FIND MYSELF ALSO BACK OF THOUGHTS TO WIT AS THEIR CREATOR AND OWNER
AND HAS ONLY HIMSELF BEFORE HIS EYES WOE TO ALL THAT IS NOT WELL PLEASING TO HIM HE SERVES NO HIGHER PERSON AND SATISFIES ONLY HIMSELF HIS CAUSE IS A PURELY
THE NOTHING OUT OF WHICH I MYSELF AS CREATOR CREATE EVERYTHING AWAY THEN WITH EVERY CONCERN THAT IS NOT ALTOGETHER MY CONCERN
NOTHING IS MORE TO ME
SHAME ON THE EGOIST WHO THINKS ONLY OF HIMSELF LET US LOOK AND SEE THEN HOW THEY MANAGE THEIR CONCERNS
AND ARE NO LONGER REGARDED FOR NOW HE SAYS ONE MUST OBEY GOD RATHER THAN MEN FROM THIS HIGH STANDPOINT EVERYTHING EARTHLY RECEDES INTO CONTEMPTIBLE REMOTENESS
AND THAT I SHALL HAVE NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE OF MY EMPTINESS I AM NOTHING IN THE SENSE OF EMPTINESS BUT I AM THE CREATIVE NOTHING
THEY HAD BEEN ONLY THOUGHTS THAT WE HAD ABOUT A THING WE THOUGHT OF THE THING SO OR SO THUS WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT GOD MADE THE WORLD THAT WE SEE THERE BUT WE DID NOT THINK OF SEARCH
AND PLAYED HERETICAL PRANKS WITH ALL TENETS OF THE FAITH AND THE TALK THEN WAS ESPECIALLY IN ITALY AND AT THE ROMAN COURT IF ONLY THE HEART REMAINS CHRISTIAN MINDED
MANKIND LOOKS ONLY AT ITSELF MANKIND WILL PROMOTE THE INTERESTS OF MANKIND ONLY MANKIND IS ITS OWN CAUSE THAT IT MAY DEVELOP
BUT BOTH REMAIN ENEMIES AND ALWAYS LIE IN WAIT THEY WATCH FOR EACH OTHER'S WEAKNESSES CHILDREN FOR THOSE OF THEIR PARENTS AND PARENTS
IF MANKIND AS YOU AFFIRM HAVE SUBSTANCE ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES TO BE ALL IN ALL TO THEMSELVES THEN I FEEL THAT I SHALL STILL LESS LACK THAT
SO THE MOST BRILLIANT THINGS HAPPENED IN THE TIME OF HUMANISM OR AS ONE MIGHT PERHAPS ALSO SAY OF MACHIAVELLIANISM PRINTING THE NEW WORLD ET CETERA
OH THAT WAS FROM MY HORSE SKIN I SOLD IT YESTERDAY EVENING
BUT AS SOON AS MORE PEOPLE PASSED BY AND NODDED HIM GOOD MORNING
HE SAYS WE SHOULD NOT EAT PORRIDGE FOR HE HAS CONJURED THE WHOLE OVEN FULL OF ROAST MEATS AND FISH AND CAKES
TILL BIG KLAUS WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT HE JUMPED INTO THE CART AND DROVE HOME AS HARD AS HE COULD THE APOTHECARY AND ALL THE PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MUST BE MAD SO THEY LET HIM GO YOU SHALL PAY FOR THIS SAID BIG KLAUS AS HE DROVE HOME
IT WAS A GOOD THING FOR MY GRANDMOTHER THAT SHE WAS DEAD ALREADY
SOON AFTER BIG KLAUS CAME OUT OF THE CHURCH AND TAKING UP THE SACK ON HIS SHOULDERS IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF IT HAD BECOME LIGHTER FOR THE OLD CATTLE DRIVER WAS NOT HALF AS HEAVY AS LITTLE KLAUS HOW EASY HE IS TO CARRY NOW
A BUSHEL OF MONEY HE IS MAKING GAME OF US THEY SAID AND THE SHOEMAKERS SEIZED THEIR YARD MEASURES AND THE TANNERS THEIR LEATHERN APRONS AND THEY GAVE BIG KLAUS A GOOD BEATING SKINS SKINS THEY CRIED MOCKINGLY
THEN HE FLAYED THE SKIN OFF HIS HORSE DRIED IT AND PUT IT IN A SACK WHICH HE THREW OVER HIS SHOULDER AND WENT INTO THE TOWN TO SELL IT HE HAD A LONG WAY TO GO AND HAD TO PASS THROUGH A GREAT DARK FOREST A DREADFUL
YOU MUSTN'T SAY THAT SAID BIG KLAUS ONLY ONE HORSE IS YOURS BUT AS SOON AS SOMEONE ELSE WAS GOING BY LITTLE KLAUS FORGOT THAT HE MUST NOT SAY IT AND CALLED OUT
THEN HE SHOUTED THE SAME THING AGAIN
I SAY SAID THE FARMER HE MUST BE UGLY YOU MUST KNOW THAT I CAN'T BEAR TO LOOK AT A SEXTON BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER I KNOW THAT IT IS THE DEVIL AND I SHA'N'T MIND I FEEL UP TO IT NOW BUT HE MUST NOT COME TOO NEAR ME
HE SAYS
ALAS NOW I HAVE NO HORSE
SKINS SKINS WHO WILL BUY SKINS HE CRIED THROUGH THE STREETS
OH DEAR OH DEAR GROANED LITTLE KLAUS IN THE SACK TWISTING AND TURNING HIMSELF BUT HE COULD NOT UNDO THE STRING THERE CAME BY AN OLD OLD SHEPHERD WITH SNOW WHITE HAIR AND A LONG STAFF IN HIS HAND
THAT MUST BE BECAUSE I HEARD PART OF THE SERVICE
SHE IS SITTING OUTSIDE IN THE CART I CANNOT BRING HER IN
SAID BIG KLAUS DO YOU THINK I SHOULD ALSO
PLUMP THERE WAS BIG KLAUS IN THE WATER AND HE SANK LIKE LEAD TO THE BOTTOM
I FELL ON THIS AND IMMEDIATELY THE SACK OPENED THE LOVELIEST MAIDEN IN SNOW WHITE GARMENTS WITH A GREEN GARLAND ROUND HER WET HAIR TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND SAID
FAREWELL SAID LITTLE KLAUS AND AWAY HE WENT WITH HIS MONEY AND THE BIG CHEST WHEREIN SAT THE SEXTON
LAID HER IN THE CART AND DROVE OFF TO THE APOTHECARY'S AND ASKED WHETHER HE WANTED TO BUY A DEAD BODY WHO IS IT AND HOW DID YOU GET IT ASKED THE APOTHECARY IT IS MY GRANDMOTHER SAID BIG KLAUS
SAID THE HOST BUT THE DEAD WOMAN DID NOT ANSWER A WORD AND SAT STILL DON'T YOU HEAR CRIED THE HOST AS LOUD AS HE COULD
WHO KNOWS THAT HE ISN'T IN THERE STILL LITTLE KLAUS GAVE THE FARMER HIS SACK WITH THE DRY SKIN AND GOT INSTEAD A GOOD BUSHELFUL OF MONEY THE FARMER ALSO GAVE HIM A WHEELBARROW TO CARRY AWAY HIS MONEY AND THE CHEST
YES NOW I HAVE SEEN HIM HE LOOKED JUST LIKE OUR SEXTON OH IT WAS HORRID SO HE HAD TO DRINK AGAIN
BUT WHY DID YOU COME UP TO US AGAIN ASKED BIG KLAUS
YOU WILL TAKE CARE OF THE CATTLE WON'T YOU ASKED THE OLD MAN
AS YOU HAVE BEEN SO GOOD AS TO GIVE ME SHELTER TO NIGHT I WILL SELL HIM YOU SHALL HAVE THE WIZARD FOR A BUSHEL OF MONEY BUT I MUST HAVE FULL MEASURE THAT YOU SHALL SAID THE FARMER
WHEN THE SUN ROSE THEY WERE IN FRONT OF A LARGE INN
HER HUSBAND WAS NOT AT HOME AND SHE TOOK IN NO STRANGERS WELL I MUST LIE DOWN OUTSIDE SAID LITTLE KLAUS
FOR US THREE BOTTLES OF WINE THEY ARE STANDING IN THE CORNER BY THE OVEN THE WIFE HAD TO FETCH THE WINE WHICH SHE HAD HIDDEN AND THE FARMER DRANK AND GREW VERY MERRY
I KILLED HER IN ORDER TO GET A BUSHEL OF MONEY YOU ARE MAD SAID THE APOTHECARY DON'T MENTION SUCH THINGS OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR HEAD AND HE BEGAN TO TELL HIM WHAT A DREADFUL THING HE HAD DONE AND WHAT A WICKED MAN HE WAS
YES BUT HELP ME FIRST SAID BIG KLAUS OR ELSE YOU SHALL HAVE A BEATING AND SO HE CREPT INTO THE LARGE SACK WHICH WAS LYING ON THE BACK OF ONE OF THE OXEN
BEGGED THE FARMER GOING TOWARDS THE CHEST WHERE HIS WIFE HAD HIDDEN THE REAL SEXTON
AND HE COULD JUST SEE INTO THE ROOM THERE STOOD A LARGE TABLE SPREAD WITH WINE AND ROAST MEAT AND A BEAUTIFUL FISH THE FARMER'S WIFE AND THE SEXTON SAT AT THE TABLE BUT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE
SO HE WENT HIMSELF TO LITTLE KLAUS WITH THE MEASURE WELL NOW WHERE DID YOU GET ALL THIS MONEY
AND A MILE FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD THERE IS ANOTHER HERD WHICH I WILL GIVE YOU AS A PRESENT NOW I SAW THAT THE RIVER WAS A GREAT HIGH ROAD FOR THE SEA PEOPLE ALONG IT THEY TRAVEL
AND THE GOOD WOMAN THEREFORE PUT IN FRONT OF HIM THE BEST FOOD SHE HAD BUT WHEN THEY HEARD THE FARMER COMING THEY WERE FRIGHTENED
HOW THE WIND WHISTLED IN MY EARS AS YOU THREW ME FROM THE BRIDGE INTO THE COLD WATER I SANK AT ONCE TO THE BOTTOM BUT I DID NOT HURT MYSELF FOR UNDERNEATH WAS GROWING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SOFT GRASS
OH SAID LITTLE KLAUS THAT WAS JUST SO POLITIC OF ME YOU HEARD WHAT I TOLD YOU THAT THE SEA MAIDEN SAID TO ME A MILE FARTHER ALONG THE ROAD AND BY THE ROAD SHE MEANT THE RIVER FOR SHE CAN GO BY NO OTHER WAY
SHE WAS FILLING UP HIS GLASS WHILE HE STUCK HIS FORK INTO THE FISH WHICH WAS HIS FAVOURITE DISH IF ONE COULD ONLY GET SOME OF THAT
HAVING FAIRLY SCUDDED BEFORE THE GALE WE ARRIVED BY THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AT THE SAUCE POSTA IN THE ROAD WE SAW GREAT NUMBERS OF DEER AND NEAR THE MOUNTAIN A GUANACO THE PLAIN
IN GUESSING WHICH THEY SHOW MUCH SKILL THEY SHOULD ALL MEET FROM DIFFERENT POINTS OF THE COMPASS ON A PLAIN PIECE OF GROUND
I DO NOT DOUBT THAT THIS IS THE CASE FOR THE GAUCHOS ASSURED ME THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DRY SUMMER THIS STREAM AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE COLORADO HAS PERIODICAL FLOODS
A FINE MALE OSTRICH BEING TURNED BY THE HEADMOST RIDERS TRIED TO ESCAPE ON ONE SIDE THE GAUCHOS PURSUED AT A RECKLESS PACE TWISTING THEIR HORSES ABOUT WITH THE MOST ADMIRABLE COMMAND
AND THEIR ONLY FUEL WAS THE DRY STALKS OF A SMALL PLANT SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING AN ALOE THE SOLE LUXURY WHICH THESE MEN ENJOYED WAS SMOKING THE LITTLE PAPER CIGARS AND SUCKING MATE
I USED TO THINK THAT THE CARRION VULTURES MAN'S CONSTANT ATTENDANTS ON THESE DREARY PLAINS WHILE SEATED ON THE LITTLE NEIGHBOURING CLIFFS SEEMED BY THEIR VERY PATIENCE TO SAY AH
AND THUS DRIVE TOGETHER THE WILD ANIMALS ONE DAY I WENT OUT HUNTING AT BAHIA BLANCA BUT THE MEN THERE MERELY RODE IN A CRESCENT EACH BEING ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE APART FROM THE OTHER
AN ALTITUDE VERY REMARKABLE ON THIS EASTERN SIDE OF THE CONTINENT I AM NOT AWARE THAT ANY FOREIGNER PREVIOUS TO MY VISIT HAD ASCENDED THIS MOUNTAIN
BUT GOT THERE WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY EVERY TWENTY YARDS I HAD THE CRAMP IN THE UPPER PART OF BOTH THIGHS SO THAT I WAS AFRAID I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE GOT DOWN AGAIN
AND WHILE CROSSING IT I SAW TWO HORSES GRAZING I IMMEDIATELY HID MYSELF IN THE LONG GRASS AND BEGAN TO RECONNOITRE BUT AS I COULD SEE NO SIGNS OF INDIANS
THEIR ALTITUDE WAS BUT LITTLE GREATER AND EVERY PURPOSE OF GEOLOGY HAD BEEN ANSWERED SO THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS NOT WORTH THE HAZARD OF ANY FURTHER EXERTION I PRESUME THE CAUSE OF THE CRAMP
AFTER A LONG GALLOP HAVING CHANGED HORSES TWICE WE REACHED THE RIO SAUCE IT IS A DEEP RAPID
THE GUIDE TOLD ME TO ASCEND THE NEAREST RIDGE WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD LEAD ME TO THE FOUR PEAKS THAT CROWN THE SUMMIT THE CLIMBING UP SUCH ROUGH ROCKS WAS VERY FATIGUING
THE PARTY SEPARATED AND SO ARRANGED THEIR PLANS
THIS HOWEVER DOES NOT APPLY TO A MAN ON HORSEBACK FOR WHEN THE SPEED OF THE HORSE IS ADDED TO THE FORCE OF THE ARM IT IS SAID THAT THEY CAN BE WHIRLED WITH EFFECT TO THE DISTANCE OF EIGHTY YARDS
BUT THE DOGS KILLED ONE WHEN WE RETURNED TO THE POSTA WE FOUND TWO OF THE PARTY RETURNED WHO HAD BEEN HUNTING BY THEMSELVES THEY HAD KILLED A PUMA AND HAD FOUND AN OSTRICH'S NEST WITH TWENTY SEVEN EGGS IN IT
THE JESUIT FALCONER WHOSE INFORMATION IS GENERALLY SO VERY CORRECT FIGURES IT AS A CONSIDERABLE RIVER RISING AT THE FOOT OF THE CORDILLERA WITH RESPECT TO ITS SOURCE
WHEN A GREAT TALL MAN BY NAME LUCIANO CAME AT FULL GALLOP AFTER HIM SHOUTING TO HIM TO STOP AND SAYING THAT HE ONLY WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM JUST AS THE SPANIARD WAS ON THE POINT OF REACHING THE BOAT LUCIANO THREW THE BALLS
AND DRINKING MUCH MATE AND SMOKING SEVERAL CIGARITOS SOON MADE UP MY BED FOR THE NIGHT THE WIND WAS VERY STRONG AND COLD BUT I NEVER SLEPT MORE COMFORTABLY SEPTEMBER
SET OUT FOR BUENOS AYRES RIO SAUCE SIERRA VENTANA THIRD POSTA DRIVING HORSES BOLAS PARTRIDGES AND FOXES FEATURES OF THE COUNTRY
READY FOR ANY SUDDEN DANGER IF THE STILLNESS OF THE DESOLATE PLAIN WAS BROKEN BY ONE OF THE DOGS BARKING A SOLDIER LEAVING THE FIRE WOULD PLACE HIS HEAD CLOSE TO THE GROUND AND THUS SLOWLY SCAN THE HORIZON
IN THE MORNING WE RODE TO SOME NEIGHBOURING HILLS TO VIEW THE COUNTRY AND TO EXAMINE THE GEOLOGY AFTER DINNER THE SOLDIERS DIVIDED THEMSELVES INTO TWO PARTIES FOR A TRIAL OF SKILL WITH THE BOLAS
WHAT A LIFE OF MISERY THESE MEN APPEAR TO US TO LEAD THEY WERE AT LEAST TEN LEAGUES FROM THE SAUCE POSTA AND SINCE THE MURDER COMMITTED BY THE INDIANS TWENTY FROM ANOTHER
WE MET A LARGE HERD OF CATTLE AND HORSES GUARDED BY FIFTEEN SOLDIERS BUT WE WERE TOLD MANY HAD BEEN LOST IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE ANIMALS ACROSS THE PLAINS
WHICH NOT ONLY ABUTS AGAINST ITS STEEP SIDES BUT LIKEWISE SEPARATES THE PARALLEL RANGES THE UNIFORMITY OF THE COLOURING GIVES AN EXTREME QUIETNESS TO THE VIEW
THE LIEUTENANT AND HIS FOUR SOLDIERS THE LATTER WERE STRANGE BEINGS THE FIRST A FINE YOUNG NEGRO THE SECOND HALF INDIAN AND NEGRO AND THE TWO OTHERS NON DESCRIPTS NAMELY
TWO SPEARS WERE STUCK IN THE GROUND TWENTY FIVE YARDS APART BUT THEY WERE STRUCK AND ENTANGLED ONLY ONCE IN FOUR OR FIVE TIMES THE BALLS CAN BE THROWN FIFTY OR SIXTY YARDS BUT WITH LITTLE CERTAINTY
BUT HE WAS DETERMINED TO GO EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD HAVE TO WALK EVERY STEP OF THE ROAD AND LIVE ON FRUITS THAT HE COULD GATHER BY THE WAY HE WAS A BRIGHT CLEVER BOY WHO HAD SPENT HIS LIFE HITHERTO IN A VILLAGE BUT WAS NOW EAGER TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
THIS WOMAN WAS A WIDOW WHO WAS CARRYING ON THE BUSINESS LEFT HER BY HER HUSBAND AS SOON AS THE CAMEL DRIVER SAW MOHAMMED HE STOPPED HIM AND SAID MY MISTRESS WISHES TO SEE YOU BEFORE NOON I THINK SHE INTENDS TO ENGAGE YOU TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER CARAVANS
THE HUNS HAD A FAMOUS KING NAMED AT'TI LA HE WAS ONLY TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BECAME THEIR KING BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS YOUNG HE WAS VERY BRAVE AND AMBITIOUS AND HE WANTED TO BE A GREAT AND POWERFUL KING NOT FAR FROM ATTILA'S PALACE
AND AT LAST THE EMPEROR HAD TO GIVE HIM A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
AND THIS TITLE HAS BEEN BORNE EVER SINCE BY THE RELIGIOUS CHIEF OF THE MOHAMMEDANS IN MODERN TIMES THE SULTANS OR RULERS OF TURKEY
AFTER THIS THE VANDALS BECAME MORE THAN EVER THE TERROR OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ALL THE COUNTRIES BORDERING UPON IT EVERY YEAR THEIR SHIPS WENT ROUND THE COASTS FROM ASIA MINOR TO SPAIN ATTACKING AND PLUNDERING CITIES ON THEIR WAY
TO THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER WHEN THE EMPEROR MAXIMUS HEARD THAT THE VANDALS WERE COMING HE PREPARED TO FLEE FROM THE CITY AND HE ADVISED THE SENATE TO DO THE SAME THE PEOPLE WERE SO ANGRY AT THIS
AND CARRYING OFF PRISONERS ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE ROMANS FAILED TO PUT A STOP TO THESE RAVAGES THE EMPEROR LEO WHO RULED OVER THE EASTERN DIVISION OF THE EMPIRE FITTED OUT A GREAT FLEET AT CONSTANTINOPLE
HE GAINED WONDERFUL VICTORIES FOR JUSTINIAN AND CONQUERED SOME OF THE OLD ROMAN PROVINCES THAT HAD BEEN LOST FOR MANY YEARS THE VICTORIES OF THESE TWO GENERALS LARGELY HELPED TO MAKE THE REIGN OF JUSTINIAN REMARKABLE IN HISTORY
AFTER RULING SEVERAL YEARS VALENTINIAN HAD JUST BEEN MURDERED BY A ROMAN NOBLE NAMED MAXIMUS WHO HAD AT ONCE MADE HIMSELF EMPEROR WHEN THE MESSENGER ENTERED THE ROOM WHERE GENSERIC WAS HE SAID GREAT KING
BUT HE WAS YOUNG AND FULL OF SPIRIT AND VERY SOON HE REMEMBERED ONLY WHAT HAD BEEN SAID TO HIM ABOUT HIS BECOMING A GREAT AND FAMOUS CONQUEROR AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR WAR HE GATHERED TOGETHER THE BEST MEN
LAUGHED AT WHAT HE TOLD THEM BUT SOME POOR PEOPLE AND A FEW SLAVES BELIEVED HIM AND ADOPTED THE NEW RELIGION OTHERS SAID HE WAS A DREAMER AND A FOOL MOHAMMED HOWEVER PAID NO HEED TO THE INSULTS HE RECEIVED
HE SAID THAT MANY TIMES THE ANGEL GABRIEL APPEARED TO HIM AND REVEALED TO HIM THE RELIGION WHICH HE AFTERWARDS TAUGHT HIS FOLLOWERS AS HE HIMSELF COULD NOT WRITE HE COMMITTED TO MEMORY ALL THAT THE ANGEL TOLD HIM AND HAD IT WRITTEN IN A BOOK
BUT HAS BECOME DARK FROM BEING WEPT UPON AND TOUCHED BY SO MANY MILLIONS OF PILGRIMS IT REALLY IS REDDISH BROWN IN COLOR BEFORE THE TIME OF MOHAMMED THE KA'A BA WAS A PAGAN TEMPLE
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HE WENT TO THE HOUSE OF KHADIJAH FOR HE WAS WELL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING EMPLOYED IN SO IMPORTANT A SERVICE
IT ITS WALL AT ONE CORNER IS THE CELEBRATED BLACK STONE MOSLEMS REGARD THIS STONE WITH THE GREATEST REVERENCE THEY SAY THAT IT CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN ONCE WHITE
LAID SIEGE TO THE CITY THINKING THAT HE WOULD COMPEL THE ROMANS TO SURRENDER BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING ANY THOUGHT OF SURRENDER BELISARIUS WAS PREPARING HIS MEN FOR FIGHT AND WHEN THEY WERE READY HE ATTACKED VITIGES AND DEFEATED HIM
FOR A LONG TIME THE GRANDEST CHURCH STRUCTURE IN THE WORLD THE GREAT TEMPLE STILL EXISTS IN ALL ITS BEAUTY AND GRANDEUR
THERE WAS A GREAT ROCKY CAVE IN THE MOUNTAINS IN THIS CAVE LIVED A STRANGE MAN CALLED THE HERMIT OF THE ROCKS
HAD SETTLED IN PARTS OF GAUL AND THEIR KING HAD NOW AGREED TO JOIN THE ROMANS AGAINST THE COMMON ENEMY THE TERRIBLE HUNS SO THE GREAT ARMY OF THE ROMANS AND VISIGOTHS
FROM THE VARIOUS TRIBES OF HIS PEOPLE AND TRAINED THEM INTO A GREAT ARMY OF GOOD SOLDIERS TWO ABOUT THIS TIME ONE OF THE KING'S SHEPHERDS WHILE TAKING CARE OF CATTLE IN THE FIELDS
SOON AFTERWARDS HE BEGAN TO PREACH TO THE PEOPLE HE SPOKE IN THE MARKET AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES
THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE A SPLENDID CHURCH WAS BUILT FOR HIM IN MEDINA IT WAS CALLED A MOSQUE AND ALL MOHAMMEDAN CHURCHES OR PLACES OF WORSHIP
BUT SINCE THEN ROME HAD BECOME AGAIN GRAND AND WEALTHY SO THERE WAS PLENTY FOR GENSERIC AND HIS VANDALS TO CARRY AWAY THEY SPENT FOURTEEN DAYS IN THE WORK OF PLUNDER THEY SACKED THE TEMPLES
THE BROTHER OF EMPEROR LEO'S WIFE BASILICUS SAILED WITH HIS SHIPS TO AFRICA AND LANDED THE ARMY NOT FAR FROM CARTHAGE GENSERIC ASKED FOR A TRUCE FOR FIVE DAYS TO CONSIDER TERMS OF PEACE AND THE TRUCE WAS GRANTED
AND HE SOON BECAME A SKILLFUL CAMEL DRIVER MOHAMMED WAS VERY FAITHFUL AND HONEST IN ALL HIS WORK HE ALWAYS SPOKE THE TRUTH AND NEVER BROKE A PROMISE I HAVE GIVEN MY PROMISE HE WOULD SAY AND I MUST KEEP IT
THAT MOHAMMED FLED FROM MECCA THIS EVENT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MOHAMMEDAN HISTORY IT IS CALLED THE FLIGHT OF THE PROPHET OR THE HEJ'I RA
TRIB O'NI AN TO COLLECT AND SIMPLIFY THE PRINCIPAL LAWS THE COLLECTION WHICH HE MADE WAS CALLED THE CODE OF JUSTINIAN IT STILL EXISTS AND IS THE MODEL ACCORDING TO WHICH MOST OF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE HAVE MADE THEIR LAWS
HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH HOWEVER TO HAVE TWO GREAT GENERALS TO LEAD HIS ARMIES ONE OF THEM WAS NAMED BELISARIUS AND THE OTHER NARSES BELISARIUS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST SOLDIERS THAT EVER LIVED
WHAT YOU DO BY THAT POND HOLE EH I COME AND TOUCH YOU AND MY GOD ONE WOULD THINK I HAVE STAB YOU SUCH AN ASS
JIMMIE DALE MOVED TO THE REAR OF THE ROOM TO THE WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE GARAGE AND YARD I DON'T SEE ANYTHING SIR JASON CALLED WATCH JIMMIE DALE ANSWERED A MINUTE PASSED TWO THREE
WHEN HE HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE HALF AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY
IN A VILE HUMOUR THAT YOU TOLD ME A LADY HAD BEEN CALLING BUT THAT I SAID IF SHE CALLED AGAIN I WASN'T TO BE DISTURBED
THE SAPLING WAS ABOUT TWENTY FEET IN HEIGHT LEVERETT THRUST THE BUTT OF IT INTO THE POOL WITHOUT ANY EFFORT HE PUSHED THE ENTIRE SAPLING OUT OF SIGHT IN THE DEPTHLESS SILT HE HAD TO MANOEUVRE VERY GINGERLY TO DUMP KLOON INTO THE POOL AND KEEP OUT OF IT HIMSELF
THAT THEY HAD IN STORE FOR HIM BEFORE THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF CLOSING DOWN AROUND HIM WITH A NETWORK OF SPIES THAT HE COULD NOT ELUDE BY MORNING JIMMIE DALE WOULD BE LARRY THE BAT AND INHABITING THE SANCTUARY AGAIN AND A TIP TO JASON HIS OLD BUTLER
THAT THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO TRAFFIC BUT THEN IT MUST BE ONE OR TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT THAT HOUR THE CITY STREETS CERTAINLY THOSE THAT WOULD BE CHOSEN BY THESE MEN WOULD BE QUITE AS DESERTED AS ANY COUNTRY ROAD AND AS FOR A SENSE OF DIRECTION
ONLY A MINUTE TO CUT THOSE WIRES
THAT SHE HAD EVER CALLED UPON HIM TO UNDERTAKE
DEVILISH CUNNING ARRAYED AGAINST HIM THAT ONCE BEFORE HE HAD EXPERIENCED THAT NIGHT
DRAGGING ROLLING BUMPING OVER ROOTS JAKE KLOON TOOK HIS LAST TRAIL THROUGH THE WILDERNESS LEAVING A REDDER PATH THAN WAS LEFT BY THE SETTING SUN THROUGH FERN AND MOSS AND WASTES OF PITCHER PLANTS
MASTER JIM SIR I GO TO BED JASON AND NOT A WORD OF THIS YES SIR GOOD NIGHT MASTER JIM GOOD NIGHT JASON JIMMIE DALE GROPED HIS WAY TO THE BIG LOUNGING CHAIR IN WHICH HE HAD FOUND JASON ASLEEP AND FLUNG HIMSELF INTO IT
THEY WERE STARING TENSELY INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE THE TELEPHONE ON THE DESK WAS RINGING VIBRANTLY CLAMOUROUSLY THROUGH THE STILLNESS OF THE ROOM JASON WHITE FRIGHTENED BEWILDERED TOUCHED HIS LIPS WITH THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE
MOUNTED THE STEPS AND WITH HIS LATCH KEY THEY HAD AT LEAST PERMITTED HIM TO RETAIN THE CONTENTS OF HIS POCKETS WHEN THEY HAD FORCED HIM TO CHANGE HIS CLOTHES OPENED THE FRONT DOOR SOFTLY AND STEPPING INSIDE CLOSED THE DOOR AS SILENTLY AS HE HAD OPENED IT HE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT TO LISTEN
IF AS HE HAD THOUGHT ONLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE HE WAS THROUGH FOREVER WITH HIS DUAL LIFE THAT WOULD NOT HAVE MATTERED
WHAT DID THIS MEAN WIRES
JASON LIFTED THE RECEIVER FROM THE HOOK YES HELLO HE SAID YES MA'AM MISTER DALE HAS COME IN BUT HE HAS RETIRED YES I TOLD HIM BUT BEGGING YOUR PARDON MA'AM
THE LOWER EDGE OF WHOSE SILL WAS JUST SLIGHTLY BELOW THE LEVEL OF HIS SHOULDER IT OPENED INWARD IF HE REMEMBERED CORRECTLY HIS FINGERS WERE FEELING FOR THE FASTENINGS IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE A THING HE MUTTERED IN ANNOYANCE WHERE WERE THE FASTENINGS AT THE SIDES OR AT THE BOTTOM
IT COULD BE ONLY SPECULATION HE HAD DECIDED THAT ONCE BEFORE THE MAN AT HIS SIDE FELT AGAIN OVER THE SCARF TO SEE THAT IT WAS IN PLACE
TWO DELICATE PURE WHITE BUTTERFLIES RARE SURVIVORS OF A NATIVE SPECIES DRIVEN FROM CIVILIZATION INTO THE WILDERNESS BY THE ADVENT OF THE FOREIGN WHITE FLUTTERED IN AIRY PLAY OVER THE DEAD MAN
AN IRRITATION AT THE USELESS TWISTINGS AND TURNINGS OF THE CAR THAT HAD LATTERLY BECOME MORE FREQUENT TOOK HOLD UPON HIM HOW MUCH LONGER WAS THIS TO LAST THEY MUST HAVE BEEN FULLY AN HOUR AND A HALF ON THE ROAD ALREADY AND AH THE CAR WAS STOPPING NOW
AS A LOGICAL CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM AT HIS HOME THOSE WIRES WHERE DID THEY LEAD TO NOT FAR AWAY THAT WOULD BE ALMOST A MECHANICAL IMPOSSIBILITY
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MASTER JIM NOTHING AT ALL SIR EXCEPT TO KEEP ASKING EACH TIME IF SHE COULD SPEAK TO YOU NOTHING ELSE JASON
HIS EYES NEVER STIRRING FROM THE SPRAWLING THING ON THE GROUND
FOOL THAT HE HAD BEEN NOT TO HAVE SEEN THAT BEFORE AND YET WOULD IT HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
SQUEAKING SQUEALING CHATTERING HIS OPINION OF MURDER AND LEVERETT SHAKING WITH THE SHOCK
BRINGING A MOMENTARY UPLIFT ONLY TO BE DISCARDED THE NEXT INSTANT WITH A SORT OF BITTER DESPERATE REGRET THESE MEN WERE NOT MEN OF MERE ORDINARY INTELLIGENCE
THE CAR STOPPED THE DOOR WAS OPENED HE WAS PUSHED TOWARD IT
HE HAD READ THOSE WORDS OF HERS THAT HAD SENT THE BLOOD COURSING AND LEAPING THROUGH HIS VEINS
IF THEY HAD DELIBERATELY MURDERED THE CHAUFFEUR BECAUSE OF A REFUSAL TO ANSWER
AND ONCE OR TWICE KLOON'S BIG BOOTS BROKE THROUGH THE CRUST OF FALLEN LEAVES SOAKING HIM TO THE ANKLES WITH BLACK SILT LEVERETT ALWAYS A COWARD HAD PURSUED HIS DEVIOUS AND LARCENOUS WAY THROUGH THE WORLD ALWAYS IN DEADLY FEAR OF SINK HOLES
AND WAS STILL AGAIN WHAT TIME IS IT JASON JIMMIE DALE ASKED PRESENTLY IT'LL BE ABOUT HALF PAST FOUR SIR GO TO BED JASON YES SIR BUT JASON'S VOICE LOW TROUBLED CAME THROUGH THE DARKNESS FROM THE UPPER END OF THE ROOM
BY MEANS OF WHICH THERE WAS A CHANCE THAT HE COULD HOIST THEM WITH THEIR OWN PETARD THE TELEPHONE RANG AGAIN IMPERATIVELY PERSISTENTLY LISTEN JASON JIMMIE DALE WAS SPEAKING RAPIDLY EARNESTLY
THERE WAS PLENTY OF MONEY NOW HIDDEN IN THE SANCTUARY ENOUGH FOR ANY EMERGENCY ENOUGH TO LAST HIM INDEFINITELY HE STEPPED FORWARD ALONG THE HALL HIS TREAD NOISELESS ON THE RICH HEAVY RUG PASSED INTO THE REAR OF THE HOUSE DESCENDED THE BACK STAIRS
COULD SHE SUPPLY THE LINKS THAT WOULD FORGE THE CHAIN INTO AN UNBROKEN WHOLE AND THEN FOR THE SECOND TIME THE CAR SLOWED DOWN AND THIS TIME THE MAN ON THE SEAT BESIDE JIMMIE DALE REACHED UP AND UNTIED THE SCARF
IN A SUBURBAN TOWN ON A COUNTRY ROAD IT SEEMED CHILDISHLY ABSURD THAT HE COULD NOT AT LEAST DIFFERENTIATE TO THAT EXTENT AND YET FROM THE MOMENT HE HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE AUTOMOBILE IN WHICH HE NOW FOUND HIMSELF HE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT THAT HE COULD NOT TELL
A SINGLE SHOT WOULD SETTLE ALL PROBLEMS FOR HIM BUT IF HE MISSED
JIMMIE DALE STEPPED TO THE SWITCH AND TURNED OFF THE LIGHT THEN STOOD HESITANT IN THE DARKNESS
IT WAS ADDRESSED TO THE REVEREND HORACE GLENNIE PERPETUAL CURATE OF MOONFLEET
AND THERE IS NOTHING BUT A HOLE THEY MUST HAVE SCOOTED RIGHT INTO THE HOLE HENNY THE DUTCH DOLL SAID RAGGEDY ANDY LAY FLAT UPON THE SHINY TIN AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE HOLE ARE YOU DOWN THERE PENNY DOLLS HE CALLED THERE WAS NO ANSWER
FOR WHO WAS THERE NOW TO CARE A JOT FOR ME I MIGHT GO AND DROWN MYSELF ON MOONFLEET BEACH FOR ANYONE THAT WOULD GRIEVE OVER ME WHAT DID IT PROFIT ME TO HAVE BROKEN BONDS AND TO BE FREE AGAIN WHAT USE WAS FREEDOM TO ME NOW WHERE WAS I TO GO
THE FOLKS WILL NEVER FIND HIM DOWN THERE FOR WE CAN NOT TELL THEM WHERE HE IS AND THEY WILL NEVER GUESS IT THE DOLLS WERE ALL VERY SAD THEY STAYED OUT UPON THE SHINY NEW TIN GUTTER UNTIL IT BEGAN RAINING AND HOPED AND HOPED THAT RAGGEDY ANDY COULD GET BACK UP TO THEM
FIRST HE LIFTED THE SAIL FROM THE DEAD BODY AND LOOKED AT THE SLEEPING FACE THEN HE TOOK OUT A COMMON PRAYER READING THE COMMENDAMUS OVER THE DEAD AND GIVING ME SPIRITUAL COMFORT AND LASTLY HE FELL TO TALKING ABOUT THE PAST
AND HOW SHE COULD STILL FIND A PLACE IN HER HEART FOR SO POOR A THING AS I BUT AS TO WHAT SHE SAID I WAS TO LEARN HER MEANING THIS VERY NIGHT MASTER RATSEY HAD COME IN AND GONE AGAIN NOT STOPPING WITH ME VERY LONG BECAUSE THERE WAS MUCH DOING ON THE BEACH
HE SAID IF WE WARN'T PRISONERS IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT THING AND NOBODY BUT A MEAN ORNERY PERSON WOULD STEAL WHEN HE WARN'T A PRISONER SO WE ALLOWED WE WOULD STEAL EVERYTHING THERE WAS THAT COME HANDY
THEN I FELT A LIGHT TOUCH ON MY SHOULDER AND LOOKING UP SAW STANDING BY ME A TALL AND STATELY WOMAN GIRL NO LONGER BUT WOMAN IN THE FULL STRENGTH AND BEAUTY OF YOUTH I KNEW HER IN A MOMENT FOR SHE HAD ALTERED LITTLE
NOW THERE'S SENSE IN THAT I SAYS LETTING ON DON'T COST NOTHING LETTING ON AIN'T NO TROUBLE AND IF IT'S ANY OBJECT I DON'T MIND LETTING ON WE WAS AT IT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEAR
WERE COME BACK TO MOONFLEET AND THAT THE OLD LANDER WAS DROWNED SAVING THE YOUNG MAN'S LIFE THE DUSK WAS CREEPING UP AS I TURNED BACK THE SAIL FROM OFF HIS FACE AND TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AT MY LOST FRIEND MY ONLY FRIEND
AND DON'T YOU RECKON THEY'LL WANT CLEWS OF COURSE THEY WILL AND YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE THEM ANY
THAT A MAN LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS FRIEND AND SOME OF MISTER GLENNIE'S VERSES AND OF OURSELVES LET ME SPEAK LAST THE MANOR HOUSE IS A STATELY HOME AGAIN WITH TRIM LAWNS AND TERRACED BALUSTRADES
CONFOUND IT IT'S FOOLISH TOM IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE HOW FOOLISH IT IS IT'S THE RIGHT WAYAND IT'S THE REGULAR WAY
THEY ALL DO WHAT IN THE NATION CAN HE DO WITH IT DO WITH IT HE CAN HIDE IT IN HIS BED CAN'T HE THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL DO AND HE'S GOT TO TOO
AS COLONEL JOHN MOHUNE SET APART THIS TREASURE IT CANNOT BE BUT THAT WE SHALL DO GRIEVOUS WRONG IN PUTTING THEM TO OTHER USE SO FARE YOU WELL AND REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE OTHER TREASURES BESIDES THIS AND THAT A GOOD WOMAN'S LOVE
ANSWERED UNCLE CLEM BUT THEY ARE PUTTING NEW SHINGLES OR SOMETHING ON THE ROOF AFTER THE MEN HAD LEFT THEIR WORK AND GONE HOME TO SUPPER AND THE HOUSE WAS QUIET RAGGEDY ANDY CAUTIOUSLY MOVED HIS HEAD OUT FROM UNDER THE LITTLE BED QUILT AND
ALONG DURING THE MORNING I BORROWED A SHEET AND A WHITE SHIRT OFF OF THE CLOTHES LINE AND I FOUND AN OLD SACK AND PUT THEM IN IT AND WE WENT DOWN AND GOT THE FOX FIRE AND PUT THAT IN TOO I CALLED IT BORROWING
THAT HE ALDOBRAND WAS DESIROUS TO LEAVE ALL HIS GOODS TO ONE
THE VILLAGE TOO RENEWED ITSELF WITH THE NEW ALMSHOUSES AND CHURCH THERE WERE OLD HOUSES REBUILT AND FRESH ONES REARED AND ALL ARE OURS EXCEPT THE WHY NOT WHICH STILL REMAINS THE DUCHY INN
WHY THERE AIN'T NO NECESSITY FOR IT AND WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SAW HIS LEG OFF FOR ANYWAY WELL SOME OF THE BEST AUTHORITIES HAS DONE IT THEY COULDN'T GET THE CHAIN OFF SO THEY JUST CUT THEIR HAND OFF AND SHOVED AND A LEG WOULD BE BETTER STILL BUT WE GOT TO LET THAT GO
NOW HENNY AND UNCLE CLEM THOUGHT THAT RAGGEDY ANDY MEANT FOR THEM TO LET GO OF HIS FEET
TIS THEN I TURN IN BED AND THANK GOD MORE FROM THE HEART PERHAPS THAN ANY OTHER LIVING MAN THAT I AM NOT FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE ON MOONFLEET BEACH AND MORE THAN ONCE I HAVE STOOD ROPE IN HAND IN THAT SAME AWFUL PLACE
I THOUGHT HE WAS WITH ALL THE OTHER DOLLS IN THE NURSERY THOUGH ALL DAY SUNDAY IT RAINED AND ALL OF SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING WHEN DADDY STARTED TO WORK IT WAS STILL RAINING AS DADDY WALKED OUT OF THE FRONT GATE
AS MASKEW'S MATCH HAD BEEN A LIGHT FOR OUR FISHING BOATS IN THE PAST LASTLY WE BEAUTIFIED THE CHURCH TURNING OUT THE CUMBROUS SEATS OF OAK AND NEATLY PEWING IT WITH DEAL AND BAIZE THAT MADE IT MOST COMMODIOUS TO SIT IN OF THE SABBATH
IS WORTH FAR MORE THAN ALL THE GOLD AND JEWELS OF THE WORLD AS I ONCE KNEW AND WITH THAT HE LEFT ME I GUESSED THAT HE HAD SPOKEN WITH GRACE THAT DAY AND AS I LAY DOZING IN FRONT OF THE FIRE ALONE IN THIS OLD ROOM I KNEW SO WELL
HE EXCLAIMED WHEN HE HAD PEEPED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE ROOF THE GUTTER
AND THE NIGHT WALKING IN DEW ACROSS THE MEADOWS TO WATCH THE SPRING CLOTHE THE BEECH BOUGHS WITH GREEN OR THE FIGS RIPEN ON THE SOUTHERN WALL WHILE BEHIND ALL IS SPREAD AS A CURTAIN THE ETERNAL SEA EVER THE SAME AND EVER CHANGING
BUT MARVELLING HOW SHE HAD COME JUST IN THE POINT OF TIME TO PROVE ME WRONG TO THINK I HAD NO FRIEND AND SHE WENT ON IS IT WELL FOR YOU TO BE HERE GRIEVE NOT TOO SADLY FOR NONE COULD HAVE DIED NOBLER THAN HE DIED
AND THERE HE SAT ALL AFTERNOON STEAMING AND DRYING OUT AND AS HE SAT THERE HE SMILED AND SMILED EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO ONE TO SEE HIM HE FELT VERY HAPPY WITHIN
MAY I NOT SHARE YOUR SORROW DID YOU NOT THINK TO TELL ME YOU WERE COME DID YOU NOT SEE THE LIGHT DID YOU NOT KNOW THERE WAS A FRIEND THAT WAITED FOR YOU I SAID NOTHING NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK
AND GILDED WOODWORK IT SEEMED TO HAVE MADE BUT ONE CIRCULAR WING SWEEP SUCH AS YOU MAY SEE A GULL MAKE OVER GREY WATER ON A STORMY DAY NEXT MOMENT IT WAS PERCHED AGAIN ON THE CHAIR BACK
FOR THE PHOENIX SPENT THE NIGHT IN PUTTING THINGS STRAIGHT HOW THE MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTED FOR THIS AND HOW MANY OF THE THEATRE OFFICIALS STILL BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE MAD ON THAT NIGHT WILL NEVER BE KNOWN NEXT DAY MOTHER SAW THE BURNT HOLES IN THE CARPET
AND SO SAT SWELTERING THROUGH WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN A MOST THRILLING MEAL HE FELT THAT HE WAS A BLOT ON THE SMART BEAUTY OF THE FAMILY AND HE HOPED THE PHOENIX KNEW WHAT HE WAS SUFFERING FOR ITS SAKE
WITH A GLOOMY SHAKE OF THE HEAD BUT I AM GETTING OLD WHY YOU'VE HARDLY BEEN HATCHED ANY TIME AT ALL TIME REMARKED THE PHOENIX IS MEASURED BY HEARTBEATS I'M SURE THE PALPITATIONS I'VE HAD SINCE I'VE KNOWN YOU
DID YOU NOTICE THEY SAID AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN SUDDENLY ANTHEA'S FACE TURNED PALE UNDER THE DIRT WHICH IT HAD COLLECTED ON IT DURING THE FIRE OH SHE CRIED
BUT WE LIKE THEM TO KNOW IT UNLESS WE ARE THE VERY BEST AND NOBLEST KIND OF PEOPLE AND ROBERT WAS JUST ORDINARY
IRONING THE DRESSES AND SEWING THE LACE IN OCCUPIED SOME TIME AND NO ONE WAS DULL BECAUSE THERE WAS THE THEATRE TO LOOK FORWARD TO AND ALSO THE POSSIBLE GROWTH OF HAIRS ON THE CARPET
MOTHER WAS VERY CLEVER BUT EVEN SHE COULD NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND THE COOK'S ACCOUNTS THE LAMB WAS VERY GLAD TO HAVE HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO PLAY WITH HIM HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THEM A BIT
WELL THEN I SHOULD SAY YOU WERE SICKENING FOR SOMETHING MUMPS OR MEASLES OR THRUSH OR TEETHING GOODBYE HE WENT AND ROBERT WAS AT LAST ABLE TO REMOVE HIS COAT MOP HIS PERSPIRING BROW
IN YOUR MIND PERHAPS SAID JANE BUT IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD IN YOUR BODY YOU'D GET TOO BALLOONY THE PHOENIX YAWNED LOOK HERE SAID ANTHEA I REALLY HAVE AN IDEA
IT WANTED TO KNOW WHY THERE WAS NO ALTAR NO FIRE NO INCENSE AND BECAME SO EXCITED AND FRETFUL AND TIRESOME THAT FOUR AT LEAST OF THE PARTY OF FIVE WISHED DEEPLY THAT IT HAD BEEN LEFT AT HOME
AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS KNEELING ON THE LINOLEUM OF THE HALL TRYING TO KISS FOUR DAMP CHILDREN AT ONCE AND LAUGHING AND CRYING BY TURNS WHILE FATHER STOOD LOOKING ON AND SAYING HE WAS BLESSED OR SOMETHING
AND MOTHER LOOKING LOVELY IN HER GREY EVENING DRESS THAT CHANGES INTO PINK AND GREEN WHEN SHE MOVES ROBERT PRETENDED THAT HE WAS TOO COLD TO TAKE OFF HIS GREAT COAT
SHE HELD IT OUT AND THE CHILDREN HOLDING IT BY ITS YIELDING CORNERS READ BOX FOR KIDDIES AT GARRICK STALLS FOR US HAYMARKET MEET CHARING CROSS
IT FLAPPED ITS GOLDEN WINGS AND CRIED IN A VOICE THAT COULD BE HEARD ALL OVER THE THEATRE WELL DONE MY SERVANTS YE HAVE MY FAVOUR AND MY COUNTENANCE LITTLE TOM ON THE STAGE STOPPED SHORT IN WHAT HE WAS SAYING
THEY LOOKED OVER THE FRONT OF THE BOX COULD THEY CLIMB DOWN IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE CERTAINLY BUT WOULD THEY BE MUCH BETTER OFF LOOK AT THE PEOPLE MOANED ANTHEA WE COULDN'T GET THROUGH
WHAT RADIANT RITES AND ALL TO DO HONOUR TO ME THE SONGS IN THE PLAY IT TOOK TO BE HYMNS IN ITS HONOUR THE CHORUSES WERE CHORIC SONGS IN ITS PRAISE THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS IT SAID
IT WAS VERY HOT THE THEATRE WAS A PIT OF FIRE
ONLY THE FABRIC OF THE OLD CARPET WAS LEFT AND THAT WAS FULL OF HOLES COME SAID THE PHOENIX I'M COOL NOW THE FOUR CHILDREN GOT ON TO WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE CARPET
OF WHOM YOU SPEAK MAY HELP ME TO FORGET THE WEIGHT OF MY YEARS SO THAT EVENING THE PHOENIX SNUGGED INSIDE THE WAISTCOAT OF ROBERT'S ETONS
I HAVE HEARD THAT THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING FIERY THEY ONLY DRINK A GREAT DEAL MUCH MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DRINK LEMONADE AND FIZZY THINGS AND THE MORE YOU DRINK OF THOSE THE MORE GOOD YOU GET
IT FLUTTERED OFF AND THEN SOME ONE SAID IN THE OTHER EAR THEY'RE SAFE AT HOME AND WHEN I TURNED AGAIN TO SEE WHO IT WAS SPEAKING HANGED IF THERE WASN'T THAT CONFOUNDED PIGEON ON MY OTHER SHOULDER DAZED BY THE FIRE I SUPPOSE
AND THE CARPET WAS LYING IN ITS PROPER PLACE ON THE NURSERY FLOOR AS CALM AND UNMOVED AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN TO THE THEATRE OR TAKEN PART IN A FIRE IN ITS LIFE
HOW FAR FAIRER THAN MY TEMPLE OR HAVE I GUESSED ARIGHT HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME HITHER TO LIFT UP MY HEART WITH EMOTIONS OF JOYOUS SURPRISE TELL ME MY ROBERT IS IT NOT THAT THIS THIS IS MY TRUE TEMPLE
THAT YOU ARE NOT TO PLAY WITH PARAFFIN WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WE HAVE BURNT A PARAFFINY RAG ANTHEA ANSWERED IT WAS NO USE TELLING MOTHER WHAT THEY HAD DONE TO THE CARPET
AND RELEASE THE CRUSHED AND DISHEVELLED PHOENIX ROBERT HAD TO ARRANGE HIS DAMP HAIR AT THE LOOKING GLASS AT THE BACK OF THE BOX AND THE PHOENIX HAD TO PREEN ITS DISORDERED FEATHERS FOR SOME TIME BEFORE EITHER OF THEM WAS FIT TO BE SEEN
I MEAN THE GREY ONE WITH THE RED TAIL ALL EYES WERE ON THE STAGE WHERE THE LOBSTER WAS DELIGHTING THE AUDIENCE WITH THAT GEM OF A SONG IF YOU CAN'T WALK STRAIGHT WALK SIDEWAYS WHEN THE PHOENIX MURMURED WARMLY
A CARPET DOESN'T HAVE AN EASY LIFE OF IT IN THIS ROOM DOES IT IT'S NOT OUR FAULT MOTHER IS IT THAT OUR BOOTS ARE THE REALLY RELIABLE KIND ROBERT ASKED THE QUESTION MORE IN SORROW THAN IN ANGER
IT WAS COVERED WITH SNOW AND SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SURROUNDING ROCKS BUT WILSON AND MULRADY SUCCEEDED IN DIGGING IT OUT AND CLEARING THE OPENING AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S HARD WORK TO THE GREAT JOY OF THE WHOLE PARTY
GLENARVAN MC NABBS ROBERT
NO MY BRAVE BOY REST YOURSELF YOU'LL BE A MAN WHEN OTHERS ARE ONLY CHILDREN AT YOUR AGE REPLIED GLENARVAN ON REACHING THE LITTLE MOUND OF PORPHYRY GLENARVAN
HAD JUST TIME TO THROW THEMSELVES FLAT ON THE GROUND BEFORE THEY SWEPT PAST LIKE A WHIRLWIND
THAT'S THE EFFECT OF LIVING BACKWARDS THE QUEEN SAID KINDLY IT ALWAYS MAKES ONE A LITTLE GIDDY AT FIRST LIVING BACKWARDS ALICE REPEATED IN GREAT ASTONISHMENT I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING
LOQUACIOUS BY HIS CALLING HE HARDLY SPOKE TO HIS PEONS THEY UNDERSTOOD THEIR DUTIES PERFECTLY IF ONE OF THE MULES STOPPED THEY URGED IT ON WITH A GUTTURAL CRY AND IF THAT PROVED UNAVAILING A GOOD SIZED PEBBLE
FOR WE ARE QUITE AS COLD AS WE ARE HUNGRY FOR MY PART I WOULD RATHER SEE A GOOD FAGGOT JUST NOW THAN A SLICE OF VENISON WELL TOM WE'LL TRY AND GET SOME COMBUSTIBLE OR OTHER SAID PAGANEL COMBUSTIBLES
AM I ADDRESSING THE WHITE QUEEN WELL YES IF YOU CALL THAT A DRESSING THE QUEEN SAID IT ISN'T MY NOTION OF THE THING AT ALL ALICE THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER DO TO HAVE
LIKE A SMALL CAMEL WITHOUT A HUMP THE HEAD WAS SMALL AND THE BODY FLATTENED THE LEGS WERE LONG AND SLENDER THE SKIN FINE AND THE HAIR THE COLOR OF CAFE AU LAIT PAGANEL HAD SCARCELY LOOKED AT IT BEFORE HE EXCLAIMED A GUANACO
OUR FRIEND MC NABBS IS RIGHT SAID GLENARVAN GET EVERYTHING IN READINESS FOR SUPPER AND I'LL GO OUT AND TURN WOODCUTTER WILSON AND I WILL GO WITH YOU SAID PAGANEL DO YOU WANT ME ASKED ROBERT GETTING UP
WHICH ACCORDING TO THE THERMOMETER WAS TEN DEGREES BELOW ZERO BESIDES THERE WAS A SORT OF FIREPLACE IN IT WITH A CHIMNEY OF BRICKS BADLY ENOUGH PUT TOGETHER CERTAINLY BUT STILL IT ALLOWED OF A FIRE BEING LIGHTED
IN SPITE OF THE PERFECT CALMNESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE COLD WAS STINGING PAGANEL CONSULTED HIS BAROMETER AND FOUND THAT THE DEPRESSION OF THE MERCURY CORRESPONDED TO AN ELEVATION OF ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET
BUT THEN I HAD DONE THE THINGS I WAS PUNISHED FOR SAID ALICE THAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE BUT IF YOU HADN'T DONE THEM THE QUEEN SAID THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER STILL BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER
AND THEIR LEGS IN HIGH LEATHER BOOTS THE MULES WERE RICHLY CAPARISONED WITH THE ARAB BIT IN THEIR MOUTHS AND LONG REINS OF PLAITED LEATHER WHICH SERVED AS A WHIP THE HEADSTALL OF THE BRIDLE WAS DECORATED WITH METAL ORNAMENTS
FIVE MONTHS AND A DAY I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SAID ALICE CAN'T YOU THE QUEEN SAID IN A PITYING TONE TRY AGAIN
AS THE BOAT GLIDED BY THERE WAS ALWAYS A MORE LOVELY ONE THAT SHE COULDN'T REACH THE PRETTIEST ARE ALWAYS FURTHER SHE SAID AT LAST WITH A SIGH AT THE OBSTINACY OF THE RUSHES IN GROWING SO FAR OFF
WHAT SORT OF AN ANIMAL IS THAT ASKED GLENARVAN ONE YOU CAN EAT AND IT IS GOOD SAVORY MEAT I ASSURE YOU A DISH OF OLYMPUS I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE FRESH MEAT FOR SUPPER AND SUCH MEAT
FOR THE SHOP WAS VERY DARK TOWARDS THE END THE EGG SEEMS TO GET FURTHER AWAY
EVEN IN THE MIDST OF HER TEARS CAN YOU KEEP FROM CRYING BY CONSIDERING THINGS SHE ASKED THAT'S THE WAY IT'S DONE THE QUEEN SAID WITH GREAT DECISION NOBODY CAN DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE YOU KNOW LET'S CONSIDER YOUR AGE TO BEGIN WITH
WHAT A LOVELY ONE ONLY I COULDN'T QUITE REACH IT AND IT CERTAINLY DID SEEM A LITTLE PROVOKING ALMOST AS IF IT HAPPENED ON PURPOSE SHE THOUGHT THAT THOUGH SHE MANAGED TO PICK PLENTY OF BEAUTIFUL RUSHES
SUDDENLY A FURIOUS AVALANCHE CAME DOWN AN AVALANCHE OF LIVING ANIMALS MAD WITH FEAR THE WHOLE PLATEAU SEEMED TO TREMBLE THERE WERE HUNDREDS PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF THESE ANIMALS AND IN SPITE OF THE RAREFIED ATMOSPHERE
THAT PARTICULAR SHELF WAS ALWAYS QUITE EMPTY THOUGH THE OTHERS ROUND IT WERE CROWDED AS FULL AS THEY COULD HOLD THINGS FLOW ABOUT SO HERE SHE SAID AT LAST IN A PLAINTIVE TONE AFTER SHE HAD SPENT A MINUTE OR SO IN VAINLY PURSUING A LARGE BRIGHT THING
BUT THE ODDEST PART OF IT ALL WAS THAT WHENEVER SHE LOOKED HARD AT ANY SHELF
SOON CURED THE ANIMAL'S OBSTINACY IF A STRAP GOT LOOSE OR A REIN FELL A PEON CAME FORWARD INSTANTLY AND THROWING OFF HIS PONCHO
HIS COMPANIONS HAD HARDLY TIME TO THANK HIM FOR HIS OBLIGING GOOD NATURE WHEN DISTANT AND PROLONGED HOWLS BROKE ON THEIR EAR PLAINLY NOT PROCEEDING FROM ONE OR TWO SOLITARY ANIMALS
THE BRUSH HAS GOT ENTANGLED IN IT THE QUEEN SAID WITH A SIGH AND I LOST THE COMB YESTERDAY ALICE CAREFULLY RELEASED THE BRUSH AND DID HER BEST TO GET THE HAIR INTO ORDER COME YOU LOOK RATHER BETTER NOW
AS IF SHE WERE FLYING AND ALICE VERY CIVILLY WENT TO MEET HER WITH THE SHAWL I'M VERY GLAD I HAPPENED TO BE IN THE WAY ALICE SAID AS SHE HELPED HER TO PUT ON HER SHAWL AGAIN THE WHITE QUEEN ONLY LOOKED AT HER IN A HELPLESS FRIGHTENED SORT OF WAY
AND OPPOSITE TO HER WAS AN OLD SHEEP SITTING IN AN ARM CHAIR KNITTING AND EVERY NOW AND THEN LEAVING OFF TO LOOK AT HER THROUGH A GREAT PAIR OF SPECTACLES WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO BUY THE SHEEP SAID AT LAST

THENCE ON AS FAR AS INDUS EAST EUPHRATES WEST AND OFT BEYOND TO SOUTH THE PERSIAN BAY AND INACCESSIBLE THE ARABIAN DROUTH HERE NINEVEH OF LENGTH WITHIN HER WALL SEVERAL DAYS JOURNEY BUILT BY NINUS OLD
NOR CONTENT IN HEAVEN BY ALL HIS ANGELS GLORIFIED REQUIRES GLORY FROM MEN
AND TO THE FIEND MADE ANSWER MEET THAT MADE VOID ALL HIS WILES
NO LET THEM SERVE THEIR ENEMIES WHO SERVE IDOLS WITH GOD YET HE AT LENGTH
TO WHAT END I HAVE BROUGHT THEE HITHER
THY KINGDOM THOUGH FORETOLD BY PROPHET OR BY ANGEL UNLESS THOU ENDEAVOUR AS THY FATHER DAVID DID THOU NEVER SHALT OBTAIN
SHALL I SEEK GLORY THEN AS VAIN MEN SEEK OFT NOT DESERVED I SEEK NOT MINE BUT HIS WHO SENT ME AND THEREBY WITNESS WHENCE I AM
OF WHOM WHAT COULD HE LESS EXPECT THAN GLORY AND BENEDICTION THAT IS THANKS THE SLIGHTEST EASIEST READIEST RECOMPENSE FROM THEM WHO COULD RETURN HIM NOTHING ELSE AND NOT RETURNING THAT
THE INTELLIGENT AMONG THEM AND THE WISE ARE FEW AND GLORY SCARCE OF FEW IS RAISED
IF YOUNG AFRICAN FOR FAME HIS WASTED COUNTRY FREED FROM PUNIC RAGE THE DEED BECOMES UNPRAISED THE MAN AT LEAST AND LOSES THOUGH BUT VERBAL HIS REWARD
REMEMBERING ABRAHAM BY SOME WONDROUS CALL MAY BRING THEM BACK REPENTANT AND SINCERE AND AT THEIR PASSING CLEAVE THE ASSYRIAN FLOOD WHILE TO THEIR NATIVE LAND WITH JOY THEY HASTE
PLAUSIBLE TO THE WORLD TO ME WORTH NAUGHT MEANS I MUST USE THOU SAY'ST PREDICTION ELSE WILL UNPREDICT AND FAIL ME OF THE THRONE MY TIME I TOLD THEE AND THAT
BUT I WILL BRING THEE WHERE THOU SOON SHALT QUIT THOSE RUDIMENTS AND SEE BEFORE THINE EYES THE MONARCHIES OF THE EARTH THEIR POMP AND STATE SUFFICIENT INTRODUCTION TO INFORM THEE OF THYSELF SO APT IN REGAL ARTS AND REGAL MYSTERIES
TO BALSARA'S HAVEN HE SAW THEM IN THEIR FORMS OF BATTLE RANGED HOW QUICK THEY WHEELED AND FLYING BEHIND THEM SHOT
WITH ALL HIS NORTHERN POWERS BESIEGED ALBRACEA AS ROMANCES TELL THE CITY OF GALLAPHRONE
AND SHAME WHO FOR SO MANY BENEFITS RECEIVED TURNED RECREANT TO GOD INGRATE AND FALSE AND SO OF ALL TRUE GOOD HIMSELF DESPOILED YET SACRILEGIOUS
AS HE WHO SEEKING ASSES FOUND A KINGDOM IRRESOLUTE UNHARDY UNADVENTROUS
SO WHEN BEGIN THE FATHER IN HIS PURPOSE HATH DECREED HE IN WHOSE HAND ALL TIMES AND SEASONS ROWL WHAT IF HE HATH DECREED THAT I SHALL FIRST BE TRIED IN HUMBLE STATE
SHOULD KINGS AND NATIONS FROM THY MOUTH CONSULT THY COUNSEL WOULD BE AS THE ORACLE URIM AND THUMMIM THOSE ORACULOUS GEMS ON AARON'S BREAST OR TONGUE OF SEERS OLD INFALLIBLE OR
WISE OR UNWISE NO DIFFERENCE NO EXEMPTION ABOVE ALL SACRIFICE OR HALLOWED GIFT GLORY HE REQUIRES AND GLORY HE RECEIVES
AND THESE TWO GREAT VICTORIES REALLY CRUSHED THE REBELLION ALTHOUGH MUCH HARD FIGHTING REMAINED TO BE DONE BEFORE THE END WAS REACHED GRANT'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST VICKSBURG DESERVES TO BE COMPARED WITH THAT OF NAPOLEON WHICH RESULTED IN THE FALL OF ULM
FROM THAT TIME UNTIL HIS DEATH LESS THAN TWO YEARS AFTERWARD HIS CAREER WAS ONE OF BRILLIANT AND ALMOST UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESS WHETHER SERVING WITH AN INDEPENDENT COMMAND IN THE VALLEY
BUT HE FAILED EVEN MORE SIGNALLY WHEN GIVEN A GREAT INDEPENDENT COMMAND HE HAD UNDER HIM ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND MEN WHEN TOWARD THE END OF APRIL HE PREPARED TO ATTACK LEE'S ARMY WHICH WAS BUT HALF AS STRONG
NO SUCH POLICY WAS PRACTICAL IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND IN THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC BUT IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED QUITE NATURAL AND PROPER TO JACKSON'S ANCESTORS THE GRIM SCOTCH IRISH WHO DEFENDED LONDONDERRY AGAINST THE FORCES OF THE STUART KING
AND HE DID NOT HEAR FROM THERE AGAIN UNTIL MAY ELEVENTH WHEN JUST AS HIS TROOPS WERE ENGAGING IN THE BATTLE OF BLACK RIVER BRIDGE AN OFFICER APPEARED FROM PORT HUDSON WITH AN ORDER FROM GENERAL HALLECK
THE CONFEDERATES ADVANCED IN A DENSE MASS YELLING AND CHEERING AND THE DISCHARGE OF THE GUNS FAIRLY BLEW THEM BACK ACROSS THE WORK'S THEY HAD JUST TAKEN
AND THE CHARGE WAS REPULSED AT ONCE BUT A FEW PRICELESS MOMENTS HAD BEEN SAVED AND PLEASANTON HAD BEEN GIVEN TIME TO POST TWENTY TWO GUNS LOADED WITH DOUBLE CANISTER WHERE THEY WOULD BEAR UPON THE ENEMY
CHEERING THEM WITH VOICE AND GESTURE HIS PALE FACE FLUSHED WITH JOY AND EXCITEMENT WHILE FROM TIME TO TIME AS HE SAT ON HIS HORSE HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND LOOKING UPWARD THANKED HEAVEN FOR THE VICTORY IT HAD VOUCHSAFED HIM
BECAUSE OF THE INFINITE WOE AND SUFFERING AND BECAUSE OF THE SPLENDID ULTIMATE TRIUMPH WE HOLD THAT IT WAS VITAL TO THE WELFARE NOT ONLY OF OUR PEOPLE ON THIS CONTINENT BUT OF THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE
THE GREATEST NATION ON THE EARTH BUT WE RECOGNIZE GLADLY THAT SOUTH AS WELL AS NORTH WHEN THE FIGHT WAS ONCE ON THE LEADERS OF THE ARMIES AND THE SOLDIERS WHOM THEY LED DISPLAYED THE SAME QUALITIES OF DARING AND STEADFAST COURAGE
AGAIN THEY CHARGED AND AGAIN WERE DRIVEN BACK AND WHEN THE BATTLE ONCE MORE BEGAN THE UNION REINFORCEMENTS HAD ARRIVED IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT JACKSON HIMSELF WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED HE HAD BEEN LEADING AND URGING ON THE ADVANCE OF HIS MEN
SHIELDED BY THE FOREST JACKSON MARCHED HIS GRAY COLUMNS RAPIDLY TO THE LEFT ALONG THE NARROW COUNTRY ROADS UNTIL HE WAS SQUARE ON THE FLANK OF THE UNION RIGHT WING WHICH WAS HELD BY THE ELEVENTH CORPS UNDER HOWARD
WHEN I HEARD A GREAT CHEERING TO THE RIGHT OF OUR LINE AND LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION SAW LAWLER IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES LEADING A CHARGE ON THE ENEMY I IMMEDIATELY MOUNTED MY HORSE AND RODE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CHARGE AND SAW NO MORE OF THE OFFICER WHO HAD DELIVERED THE MESSAGE
AND MOREOVER IT DELAYED PEMBERTON WHEN DELAY WAS OF VALUE TO GRANT IN FINISHING JOHNSTON AFTER THIS USELESS TURN TO THE SOUTHWARD PEMBERTON RESUMED HIS MARCH TO THE EAST AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE BEGINNING IN ACCORDANCE WITH JOHNSTON'S ORDERS
FOR A WHILE IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE ARMY WOULD BE SWEPT OFF BUT HOOKER AND HIS SUBORDINATES EXERTED EVERY EFFORT TO RESTORE ORDER IT WAS IMPERATIVE TO GAIN TIME SO THAT THE UNTOUCHED PORTIONS OF THE ARMY COULD FORM ACROSS THE LINE OF THE CONFEDERATE ADVANCE
THROUGH A MISTAKE BY THE CONFEDERATES BEHIND THEM JACKSON FELL STRUCK IN SEVERAL PLACES HE WAS PUT IN A LITTER AND CARRIED BACK BUT HE NEVER LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHEN ONE OF HIS GENERALS COMPLAINED OF THE TERRIBLE EFFECT OF THE UNION CANNONADE
LIKE A SERVANT OF THE LORD WITH HIS BIBLE AND HIS SWORD OUR GENERAL RODE ALONG US TO FORM US FOR THE FIGHT MACAULAY
IN DASH AND LIGHT HEARTED DARING CUSTER AND KEARNEY STOOD AS CONSPICUOUS AS STUART AND MORGAN AND ON THE OTHER HAND NO NORTHERN GENERAL APPROACHED THE ROUNDHEAD TYPE THE TYPE OF THE STERN RELIGIOUS WARRIORS WHO FOUGHT UNDER CROMWELL
THENCE HE MARCHED TO GRAND GULF ON THE MISSISSIPPI WHICH HE TOOK AND WHICH HE HAD PLANNED TO MAKE A BASE OF SUPPLY WHEN HE REACHED GRAND GULF HOWEVER HE FOUND THAT HE WOULD BE OBLIGED TO WAIT A MONTH
FLEEING FROM THEIR COVERTS AT THE APPROACH OF THE CONFEDERATES SUDDENLY CAME RUNNING OVER AND INTO THE UNION LINES IN ANOTHER MINUTE THE FRIGHTENED PICKETS CAME TUMBLING BACK AND RIGHT BEHIND THEM CAME THE LONG FILES OF CHARGING YELLING CONFEDERATES
TO RETURN TO GRAND GULF AND THENCE COOPERATE WITH BANKS AGAINST PORT HUDSON GRANT REPLIED THAT THE ORDER CAME TOO LATE THE BEARER OF THE DESPATCH INSISTED THAT I OUGHT TO OBEY THE ORDER AND WAS GIVING ARGUMENTS TO SUPPORT THE POSITION
AS DARKNESS DREW NEAR HE WAS IN THE FRONT WHERE FRIEND AND FOE WERE MINGLED IN ALMOST INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION HE AND HIS STAFF WERE FIRED AT AT CLOSE RANGE BY THE UNION TROOPS AND AS THEY TURNED WERE FIRED AT AGAIN
ON JANUARY TWENTY NINTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE GENERAL GRANT TOOK COMMAND OF THE ARMY INTENDED TO OPERATE AGAINST VICKSBURG THE LAST PLACE HELD BY THE REBELS ON THE MISSISSIPPI
BY A SYSTEM OF GRADUAL APPROACHES A STRONG BASE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AT MEMPHIS AND THEN THE ARMY AND THE FLEET MOVED GRADUALLY FORWARD BUILDING STOREHOUSES AND TAKING STRONG POSITIONS AS THEY WENT
HE ANSWERED YOU MUST HOLD YOUR GROUND FOR SEVERAL DAYS HE LINGERED HEARING HOW LEE BEAT HOOKER IN DETAIL AND FORCED HIM BACK ACROSS THE RIVER THEN THE OLD PURITAN DIED AT THE END HIS MIND WANDERED
AN INTERCEPTED MESSAGE REVEALED TO HIM THE FACT THAT PEMBERTON IN ACCORDANCE WITH JOHNSTON'S ORDERS HAD COME OUT OF VICKSBURG WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN AND WAS MOVING EASTWARD AGAINST HIM PEMBERTON HOWEVER INSTEAD OF HOLDING A STRAIGHT LINE AGAINST GRANT
IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE HOOKER HAD COMMAND OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC LIKE MC CLELLAN HE WAS ABLE TO PERFECT THE DISCIPLINE OF HIS FORCES AND TO ORGANIZE THEM AND AS A DIVISION COMMANDER HE WAS BETTER THAN MC CLELLAN
SHE GOES TO THE TOP OF A HIGH TOWER TO PRECIPITATE HERSELF HEADLONG THUS TO DESCEND THE SHORTEST WAY TO THE SHADES BELOW BUT A VOICE FROM THE TOWER SAID TO HER WHY POOR UNLUCKY GIRL DOST THOU DESIGN TO PUT AN END TO THY DAYS IN SO DREADFUL A MANNER
FOR SEE SHE WALKS THE EARTH LOVE'S OWN HIS WEDDED BRIDE BY HOLIEST VOW PLEDGED IN OLYMPUS AND MADE KNOWN TO MORTALS BY THE TYPE WHICH NOW HANGS GLITTERING ON HER SNOWY BROW
AND BY OBSERVING HIS DIRECTIONS SHE SOON RETURNED TO VENUS WITH HER ARMS FULL OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE BUT SHE RECEIVED NOT THE APPROBATION OF HER IMPLACABLE MISTRESS WHO SAID I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS BY NONE OF YOUR OWN DOINGS THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS TASK
STARTLED WITH WHICH HE OPENED HIS EYES AND FIXED THEM FULL UPON HER THEN WITHOUT SAYING ONE WORD HE SPREAD HIS WHITE WINGS AND FLEW OUT OF THE WINDOW PSYCHE IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO FOLLOW HIM FELL FROM THE WINDOW TO THE GROUND
GIVE ME THE PALM OF BEAUTY OVER MY ILLUSTRIOUS RIVALS PALLAS AND JUNO BUT SHE SHALL NOT SO QUIETLY USURP MY HONORS I WILL GIVE HER CAUSE TO REPENT OF SO UNLAWFUL A BEAUTY
AND A SHARP KNIFE AND HID THEM OUT OF SIGHT OF HER HUSBAND WHEN HE HAD FALLEN INTO HIS FIRST SLEEP SHE SILENTLY ROSE AND UNCOVERING HER LAMP BEHELD NOT A HIDEOUS MONSTER BUT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND CHARMING OF THE GODS
YOU SHOULD RATHER HAVE GRIEVED WHEN THE PEOPLE SHOWERED UPON ME UNDESERVED HONORS AND WITH ONE VOICE CALLED ME A VENUS I NOW PERCEIVE THAT I AM A VICTIM TO THAT NAME I SUBMIT LEAD ME TO THAT ROCK TO WHICH MY UNHAPPY FATE HAS DESTINED ME
PUT THEM IN CONCEALMENT THAT YOUR HUSBAND MAY NOT DISCOVER THEM AND WHEN HE IS SOUND ASLEEP SLIP OUT OF BED BRING FORTH YOUR LAMP AND SEE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER WHAT THEY SAY IS TRUE OR NOT IF IT IS HESITATE NOT TO CUT OFF THE MONSTER'S HEAD AND THEREBY RECOVER YOUR LIBERTY
BUT AN INFERNAL AND TRULY STYGIAN SLEEP WHICH BEING THUS SET FREE FROM ITS PRISON TOOK POSSESSION OF HER AND SHE FELL DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE ROAD A SLEEPY CORPSE WITHOUT SENSE OR MOTION BUT CUPID BEING NOW RECOVERED FROM HIS WOUND
SOON MADE HER CONFESS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO FILL HER BOSOM WITH DARK SUSPICIONS CALL TO MIND THEY SAID
OF PALE MOUTHED PROPHET DREAMING IN MOORE'S SUMMER FETE A FANCY BALL IS DESCRIBED IN WHICH ONE OF THE CHARACTERS PERSONATED IS PSYCHE NOT IN DARK DISGUISE TO NIGHT HATH OUR YOUNG HEROINE VEILED HER LIGHT
THROUGH THE DIM GROTTO'S TRACERY OF SPARS MID THE PINE TEMPLES ON THE MOONLIT MOUNT WHERE SILENCE SITS TO LISTEN TO THE STARS IN THE DEEP GLADE WHERE DWELLS THE BROODING DOVE THE PAINTED VALLEY AND THE SCENTED AIR
THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE FIRST APPEARS IN THE WORKS OF APULEIUS A WRITER OF THE SECOND CENTURY OF OUR ERA IT IS THEREFORE OF MUCH MORE RECENT DATE THAN MOST OF THE LEGENDS OF THE AGE OF FABLE IT IS THIS THAT KEATS ALLUDES TO IN HIS ODE TO PSYCHE
BUT THE VOICE ADDED WHEN PROSERPINE HAS GIVEN YOU THE BOX FILLED WITH HER BEAUTY OF ALL THINGS THIS IS CHIEFLY TO BE OBSERVED BY YOU
AND THAT BRIGHT SPIRIT OF IMMORTAL BIRTH UNTIL HER PINING SOUL AND WEEPING EYES HAD LEARNED TO SEEK HIM ONLY IN THE SKIES TILL WINGS UNTO THE WEARY HEART WERE GIVEN AND SHE BECAME LOVE'S ANGEL BRIDE IN HEAVEN
THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN MERIT YOUR LOVER MUST BE BY DINT OF INDUSTRY AND DILIGENCE I WILL MAKE TRIAL OF YOUR HOUSEWIFERY THEN SHE ORDERED PSYCHE TO BE LED TO THE STOREHOUSE OF HER TEMPLE
PSYCHE WAS NOW SATISFIED THAT HER DESTRUCTION WAS AT HAND BEING OBLIGED TO GO WITH HER OWN FEET DIRECTLY DOWN TO EREBUS WHEREFORE TO MAKE NO DELAY OF WHAT WAS NOT TO BE AVOIDED
HER EARS TOO WERE FEASTED WITH MUSIC FROM INVISIBLE PERFORMERS OF WHOM ONE SANG ANOTHER PLAYED ON THE LUTE AND ALL CLOSED IN THE WONDERFUL HARMONY OF A FULL CHORUS SHE HAD NOT YET SEEN HER DESTINED HUSBAND
SCATTERED ABOUT LAY SICKLES AND RAKES AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF HARVEST WITHOUT ORDER AS IF THROWN CARELESSLY OUT OF THE WEARY REAPERS HANDS IN THE SULTRY HOURS OF THE DAY THIS UNSEEMLY CONFUSION
BUT GO RETURN TO YOUR SISTERS WHOSE ADVICE YOU SEEM TO THINK PREFERABLE TO MINE I INFLICT NO OTHER PUNISHMENT ON YOU THAN TO LEAVE YOU FOREVER LOVE CANNOT DWELL WITH SUSPICION SO SAYING HE FLED AWAY LEAVING POOR PSYCHE PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND
PSYCHE OBEDIENTLY WENT TO THE RIVERSIDE PREPARED TO DO HER BEST TO EXECUTE THE COMMAND BUT THE RIVER GOD INSPIRED THE REEDS WITH HARMONIOUS MURMURS WHICH SEEMED TO SAY O MAIDEN SEVERELY TRIED TEMPT NOT THE DANGEROUS FLOOD
MOST UNDUTIFUL AND FAITHLESS OF SERVANTS SAID SHE DO YOU AT LAST REMEMBER THAT YOU REALLY HAVE A MISTRESS OR HAVE YOU RATHER COME TO SEE YOUR SICK HUSBAND YET LAID UP OF THE WOUND GIVEN HIM BY HIS LOVING WIFE YOU ARE SO ILL FAVORED AND DISAGREEABLE
FOR IT WAS HIS PLEASURE FOR THE BEST OF REASONS TO KEEP CONCEALED WHY SHOULD YOU WISH TO BEHOLD ME HE SAID HAVE YOU ANY DOUBT OF MY LOVE HAVE YOU ANY WISH UNGRATIFIED IF YOU SAW ME PERHAPS YOU WOULD FEAR ME PERHAPS ADORE ME
PSYCHE HENCEFORTH FROWNED UPON BY VENUS DERIVED NO BENEFIT FROM ALL HER CHARMS TRUE ALL EYES WERE CAST EAGERLY UPON HER AND EVERY MOUTH SPOKE HER PRAISES
A CERTAIN KING AND QUEEN HAD THREE DAUGHTERS THE CHARMS OF THE TWO ELDER WERE MORE THAN COMMON BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNGEST WAS SO WONDERFUL THAT THE POVERTY OF LANGUAGE IS UNABLE TO EXPRESS ITS DUE PRAISE THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY WAS SO GREAT
THERE ARE TWO FOUNTAINS IN VENUS'S GARDEN ONE OF SWEET WATERS THE OTHER OF BITTER CUPID FILLED TWO AMBER VASES ONE FROM EACH FOUNTAIN AND SUSPENDING THEM FROM THE TOP OF HIS QUIVER HASTENED TO THE CHAMBER OF PSYCHE WHOM HE FOUND ASLEEP
THE INHABITANTS OF THIS VALLEY SAY THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS A TERRIBLE AND MONSTROUS SERPENT WHO NOURISHES YOU FOR A WHILE WITH DAINTIES THAT HE MAY BY AND BY DEVOUR YOU TAKE OUR ADVICE PROVIDE YOURSELF WITH A LAMP AND A SHARP KNIFE
THEREFORE HIS WIFE WAS NOT SURPRISED ALTHOUGH THE DUSK WAS FALLING THAT FARMER CHRISTOPHER SHOULD BE AT WORK IN BLIND MAN'S HOLIDAY AS WE CALL IT BUT SHE WAS SURPRISED NAY ASTONISHED WHEN BY THE LIGHT OF THE KITCHEN FIRE BRIGHTENED UP FOR HER HUSBAND
WATER DROPPED ON IT FROM A MEDICINE DROPPER WILL BOIL
THIS I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO DO BECAUSE IT SAVED SO MUCH TROUBLE AND I HAD NO MONEY TO SPEND WITH HIM BUT STILL HE REQUESTED THE USE OF MY NAME AND I BEGGED HIM TO DO THE BEST WITH IT AS I NEVER HAD KEPT A BANKER
AND THEMSELVES AS WELL IN A DIFFERENT WAY THEY DID WHAT NEARLY ALL ENGLISHMEN DO WHEN A THING IS RIGHT AND SENSIBLE THEY SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AND SAID THAT THEY COULD NOT DENY BUT THAT THERE WAS REASON IN MY VIEW OF THE MATTER AND ALTHOUGH THEY THEMSELVES MUST BE THE LOSERS WHICH WAS A HANDSOME THING TO SAY
IF THIS WERE ALL THE STYLE OF IT THEN HAVING KNOWN HIM A LUSTY MAN AND A FINE SINGER IN AN ALE HOUSE
THE WORKMEN AT THE SWEDISH MELTING HOUSE SHOWED THE SAME THING TO SOME TRAVELLERS IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY FOR REGNARD SAW IT IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY ONE AT THE COPPER WORKS IN LAPLAND
WHICH HIS MOTHER SAID NOTHING COULD EQUAL NEVERTHELESS HE WOULD COME TO BE NURSED AS REGULAR AS A CLOCK ALMOST AND INASMUCH AS HE WAS THE FIRST BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER MADE MUCH OF HIM FOR GOD ONLY KNEW WHETHER THEY COULD EVER COMPASS SUCH ANOTHER ONE
THE METALLIC DRESS WHICH IS SUPERADDED TO THESE MEANS OF DEFENCE CONSISTS OF FIVE PRINCIPAL PIECES
HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE NOBLER PURPOSE OF SAVING HUMAN LIFE AND RESCUING PROPERTY FROM THE FLAMES
IN A WORD THEIR TASTE BEING OFFENDED THEY CAME BACK TO THE KITCHEN AND STAMPED AND THERE WAS THE BABY LYING BY EVIL LUCK THIS CHILD BEGAN TO SQUEAL ABOUT HIS MOTHER HAVING BEEN PETTED HITHERTO AND WONT TO GET ALL HE WANTED BY RAISING HIS VOICE BUT A LITTLE
THEN LET US HAVE A GAME OF LORIOT WITH THE BABY IT WILL BE THE BEST THING THAT COULD BEFALL A LUSTY INFANT HERETIC RIDE A COCK HORSE TO BANBURY CROSS BYE BYE BABY BUNTING TOSS HIM UP AND LET ME SEE IF MY WRIST BE STEADY
WHY THE HAND MAY BE DIPPED IN MOLTEN METALS
FOR HE COULD RUN SAY TWO YARDS ALONE AND PERHAPS FOUR OR FIVE BY HOLDING TO HANDLES AND HE HAD A WAY OF LOOKING ROUND AND SPREADING HIS LEGS AND LAUGHING WITH HIS BRAVE LITTLE BODY WELL FETCHED UP AFTER A DESPERATE JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE TABLE
HE THEN SQUEEZED THE FINGERS OF HIS HORNY HAND CLOSE TOGETHER PUT IT FOR A FEW MINUTES UNDER HIS ARMPIT TO MAKE IT SWEAT AS HE SAID AND TAKING IT AGAIN OUT DREW IT OVER A LADLE FILLED WITH MELTED COPPER SOME OF WHICH HE SKIMMED OFF
FOR OFTENTIME SHE HAD HICCOUGHS WHILE THIS GOOD MAID WAS IN THE OVEN BY SIDE OF BACK KITCHEN FIREPLACE WITH A FAGGOT OF WOOD DRAWN OVER HER AND LYING SO THAT HER OWN HEART BEAT WORSE THAN IF SHE WERE BAKING THE MEN AS I SAID BEFORE
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THE REAL GENTRY FOR A LONG TIME TREATED MY NEW HONOURS WITH CONTEMPT AND RIDICULE BUT GRADUALLY AS THEY FOUND THAT I WAS NOT SUCH A FOOL AS TO CLAIM ANY EQUALITY WITH THEM BUT WENT ABOUT MY FARM WORK AND THREW ANOTHER MAN AT WRESTLING
A PLOVER BEING A WILD BIRD JUST THE SAME AS A RAVEN IS UPON THIS CHAIN OF REASONING AND WITHOUT ANY WEAK MISGIVINGS
THAT NOTHING BUT THE NEW WISPS OF SAMSON COULD HAVE HELD ME IN LONDON TOWN LORNA WAS MOVED WITH EQUAL LONGING TOWARDS THE COUNTRY AND COUNTRY WAYS AND SHE SPOKE QUITE AS MUCH OF THE GLISTENING DEW AS SHE DID OF THE SMELL OF OUR OVEN
DECLINED IN THE MOST DECIDED MANNER TO PAY A FARTHING TOWARDS IT AND AS I HAD NOW NO MONEY LEFT THE HERALDS BECAME AS BLUE AS AZURE AND AS RED AS GULES UNTIL HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN CAME FORWARD VERY KINDLY AND SAID THAT IF HIS MAJESTY GAVE ME A COAT OF ARMS
COOLING WATER AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE DEGREES
THE SAME GENTLEMAN WHO PERFORMED THE EXPERIMENTS ABOVE DESCRIBED VENTURED TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO STILL HIGHER TEMPERATURES SIR CHARLES BLAGDEN WENT INTO A ROOM WHERE THE HEAT WAS ONE DEGREE OR TWO DEGREES ABOVE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES
AND SHE MEANT WHAT WAS RIGHT BY HER MASTER AND MISTRESS BUT COULD NOT HELP BEING FRIGHTENED AND MANY WOMEN HAVE BLAMED HER AS I THINK UNDULY FOR HER MODE OF FORSAKING BABY SO IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN BABY INSTINCT RATHER THAN REASON MIGHT HAVE HAD THE DAY WITH HER
BEFORE THE HEAT BECAME INCONVENIENT A FIREMAN HAVING HIS HAND WITHIN A DOUBLE ASBESTOS GLOVE AND ITS PALM PROTECTED BY A PIECE OF ASBESTOS CLOTH SEIZED WITH IMPUNITY A LARGE PIECE OF RED HOT IRON
THE HEAD DRESS IS A LARGE CAP WHICH ENVELOPS THE WHOLE HEAD DOWN TO THE NECK HAVING SUITABLE PERFORATIONS FOR THE EYES NOSE AND MOUTH THE STOCKINGS AND CAP ARE SINGLE BUT THE GLOVES ARE MADE OF DOUBLE AMIANTHUS CLOTH
IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS NO MISTAKE RESPECTING THE DEGREE OF HEAT INDICATED BY THE THERMOMETER AND THAT THE AIR WHICH THEY BREATHED WAS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING ALL THE WELL KNOWN EFFECTS OF SUCH A HEAT ON INANIMATE MATTER
WHO HAS TRAVELLED THROUGH ALL EUROPE TO PRESENT THIS VALUABLE GIFT TO HIS SPECIES SIR H DAVY HAD LONG AGO SHOWN THAT A SAFETY LAMP FOR ILLUMINATING MINES CONTAINING INFLAMMABLE AIR MIGHT BE CONSTRUCTED OF WIRE GAUZE ALONE
AND REMAINED EIGHT MINUTES IN THIS SITUATION FREQUENTLY WALKING ABOUT TO ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROOM BUT STANDING STILL MOST OF THE TIME IN THE COOLEST SPOT
AND AS THEY HAD NOTICED THAT THE EFFECT OF THE HOT AIR WAS GREATLY INCREASED BY PUTTING IT IN MOTION THEY BLEW UPON THE STEAK WITH A PAIR OF BELLOWS AND THUS HASTENED THE DRESSING OF IT TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE GREATEST PORTION OF IT WAS FOUND TO BE PRETTY WELL DONE IN THIRTEEN MINUTES
AND MOVED HIS HAND BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS VERY QUICKLY BY WAY OF OSTENTATION WHILE I WAS VIEWING THIS PERFORMANCE I REMARKED A SMELL LIKE THAT OF SINGED HORN OR LEATHER THOUGH HIS HAND WAS NOT BURNT
WITH THE RASP OF WINTER BRISTLES RISING THROUGH AND AMONG THE SOFT SUMMER COAT AND WHEN THE NEW STRAW BEGAN TO COME IN GOLDEN WITH THE HARVEST GLOSS AND SMELLING MOST DIVINELY AT THOSE STRANGE LIVERY STABLES WHERE THE NAGS ARE PUT QUITE TAIL TO TAIL
GOD HAS MADE THE EARTH QUITE LARGE WITH A SPREAD OF LAND LARGE ENOUGH FOR ALL TO LIVE ON WITHOUT FIGHTING ALSO A MIGHTY SPREAD OF WATER LAYING HANDS ON SAND AND CLIFF WITH A SOLEMN VOICE IN STORM TIME
AND TWO HOGSHEADS AND A HALF OF CIDER AND A HUNDREDWEIGHT OF CANDLES NOT TO MENTION OTHER THINGS OF ALMOST EVERY VARIETY WHICH THEY GOT BY INSISTING UPON IT SURELY THESE MIGHT HAVE SUFFICED TO KEEP THE PEOPLE IN THEIR PLACE WITH NO OUTBURST OF WANTONNESS
THEY ADVANCED TO THEIR TREMBLING LADY EXPECTING HER TO APPROVE THEIR SERVICES HELEN DREW NEAR SHE BOWED TO THE PRIESTS ONE OF THE WOMEN PUT HER HAND ON THE PALL TO UNCOVER THE ONCE LOVELY FACE OF THE MURDERED MARION
AND THE HEREDITARY PROPERTY OF HIS FATHER SIR MALCOLM WALLACE WAS SITUATED IN THE ABBEY PARISH OF PAISLEY
AND OF HELEN MAR'S GRATITUDE THE MAN KISSED IT RESPECTFULLY AND BOWING SWORE TO PRESERVE SO DISTINGUISHING A GIFT TO THE LATEST HOUR OF HIS EXISTENCE
BY THE DOLEFUL LAMENT OF THE TROOP RETURNING FROM ELLERSLIE SHE DROPPED THE HALF FORMED SCARF FROM HER HAND AND LISTENED WITHOUT DARING TO DRAW HER BREATH TO THE DEEP TONED LAMENTATIONS
AND FORMING THE SCARF SHE MEANT SHOULD ADORN HER PRESENT THUS TIME FLEW TILL THE SAND GLASS TOLD HER IT WAS THE EIGHTH HOUR BUT ERE SHE HAD FINISHED HER TASK SHE WAS ROUSED FROM THE PROFOUND STILLNESS IN WHICH THAT PART OF THE CASTLE LAY
USUALLY CALLED THE RHYMER HE WAS A POET AND A SAGE AND BELIEVED BY HIS CONTEMPORARIES TO BE A PROPHET HE WAS BORN AT ERCILDOWN A VILLAGE ON THE LEEDER OR LAUDER WHERE THE RUINS OF HIS PATERNAL CASTLE CALLED LEARMONT TOWER STILL REMAIN
ERE HALBERT WITHDREW HE RESPECTFULLY PUT HER HAND TO HIS LIPS GOOD NIGHT CONTINUED SHE ERE YOU SEE ME AGAIN I TRUST THE EARTHLY PART OF THE ANGEL NOW IN PARADISE WILL BE SAFE WITHIN THESE TOWERS
WHO IS IT THAT DARES THUS INVADE THY DUTIES BUT MY GRATITUDE GRATITUDE TO THE ONCE LOVED LORD WILL NOT OFFEND THY PURE SPIRIT
AND TO PREVENT HER HEARING FROM YOUR OWN LIPS ALL YOU HAVE NOW TOLD ME
AGAIN THE MOURNFUL WAILINGS ROSE ON THE AIR AND WITH A CONVULSION OF FEELINGS SHE COULD NOT RESTRAIN SHE THREW HERSELF ON HER KNEES AND LEANING HER HEAD ON THE NEWLY ADORNED HELMET WEPT PROFUSELY
SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE HEARD THE DIRGE OF HER COUNTRY SO PIERCING SO THRILLINGLY AWFUL HER HEAD FELL ON THE ARMOR AND SCARF
THAT HE IS AN OUTLAW LADY MAR SPRINGS FROM US THAT DEATH IS THE PREFERABLE COMFORTER OF HIS SORROWS ALSO HE OWES TO US FOR WAS IT NOT FOR MY FATHER'S SAKE THAT HIS WIFE FELL
HE POURED A THOUSAND BLESSINGS ON HER HEAD AND ALMOST THOUGHT THAT HE SAW IN HER BEAUTIFUL FORM ONE OF HEAVEN'S INHABITANTS SENT TO BEAR AWAY HIS DEAR MISTRESS TO HER DIVINE ABODE ON ENTERING HER FATHER'S APARTMENT
CHAPTER SEVEN BOTHWELL CASTLE MEANWHILE THE LADY HELEN HAD RETIRED TO HER OWN APARTMENTS LORD MAR'S BANNER BEING BROUGHT TO HER FROM THE ARMORY SHE SAT DOWN TO WEAVE INTO ITS SILKEN TEXTURE
RETIRE WITH HIS FAMILY INTO THE HIGHLANDS AND THERE AWAIT THE ISSUE OF THE CONTEST IT IS TOO LATE TO RETREAT DEAR MADAM CONTINUED SHE
ONE OF THE MEN OUT OF THE NUMBERS WHO HASTENED TO THE ASSISTANCE OF THEIR MASTER FELL DEAD ON HER BODY WHILE THE CHIEF HIMSELF SORELY WOUNDED AND BREATHING REVENGE AND BLASPHEMY WAS FORCED OFF BY THE SURVIVORS
MACGREGOR'S WIFE WAS SET ON A PILLION BEHIND HIM AND SOULIS GIVING THE WORD THEY ALL MARCHED ON AT A RAPID PACE IN A FEW HOURS HAVING CLEARED THE SHADY VALLEYS OF THE CLYDE
ONE OF THE MOST EXCELLENT PROOF HE DREW FROM AN OAKEN CHEST A COAT OF BLACK MAIL STUDDED WITH GOLD HELEN ADMIRED ITS STRENGTH AND BEAUTY IT IS THE RICHEST IN ALL SCOTLAND ANSWERED HE
AND WELL IT MIGHT BE FOR IT WAS NOT ONLY THE HOME OF ALL HIS WEDDED JOYS BUT UNDER ITS ROOF HIS MOTHER THE LADY MARGARET CRAWFORD DREW HER FIRST BREATH AH WOE IS ME
LADY HELEN REPLIED THAT SHE REVERED HIS SENTIMENTS TOO SINCERELY TO INSULT THEM BY ANY PERSUASIONS TO THE CONTRARY AND TAKING A DIAMOND CLASP FROM HER BOSOM SHE PUT IT INTO HIS HAND WEAR IT IN REMEMBRANCE OF YOUR VIRTUE
HELEN LOVED THE RESOLUTION OF HER COUSIN AND BELIEVING THAT THE NOW RAVAGED ELLERSLIE HAD NO ATTRACTIONS TO HOLD MARAUDERS AMONGST ITS RUINS SHE DISMISSED LORD ANDREW TO MAKE HIS PREPARATIONS AND TURNED HERSELF TO PREFER HER SUIT ACCORDINGLY TO HER FATHER
STILL CALLED WALLACE'S OAK STANDS CLOSE TO THE ROAD FROM PAISLEY TO LEITH AND WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE FROM IT ONCE STOOD THE MANOR OF ELLERSLIE THE VENERABLE NAME IS NOW CORRUPTED INTO ELDERSLIE
WE SHALL NOT BE BETTER OFF ANSWERED HE SHOULD WE ATTEMPT TO RETURN PRECIPICES LIE ON EITHER SIDE AND TO STAND STILL WOULD BE EQUALLY PERILOUS THE TORRENTS FROM THE HEIGHTS INCREASE SO RAPIDLY
ON HEARING THAT THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE HE HAD SO LATELY BELIEVED HIS OWN BEYOND THE POWER OF FATE THAT HIS PROPERTY AS HE CALLED HER THE DEVOTED SLAVE OF HIS WILL THE MISTRESS OF HIS DESTINY WAS LOST TO HIM FOREVER
AT THAT MOMENT HER COUCH WAS SHAKEN BY A SUDDEN SHOCK AND IN THE NEXT SHE WAS COVERED WITH THE BLOOD OF SOULIS A STROKE FROM AN UNSEEN ARM HAD REACHED HIM AND STARTING ON HIS FEET A FEARFUL BATTLE OF SWORDS TOOK PLACE OVER THE PROSTRATE HELEN
WHEN FOR HER SAKE HE THUS FORSWEARS ALL FUTURE JOYS BUT THOSE WHICH CAMPS AND VICTORIES MAY YIELD AH WHAT WOULD I GIVE TO BE MY COUSIN MURRAY TO BEAR THIS PENNON AT HIS SIDE
THEN HER SACRED RELICS HAVE BEEN CONSUMED IN THE BURNING HOUSE I HOPE NOT REJOINED HALBERT THE CHAPEL I SPEAK OF IS AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE MAIN BUILDING IT WAS EXCAVATED IN THE ROCK BY SIR RONALD CRAWFORD
AND WITH A BEATING HEART RETIRED TO PROSECUTE HER PLANS MURRAY WHO MET HER IN THE ANTEROOM INFORMED HER THAT FIFTY MEN THE STURDIEST IN THE GLEN AWAITED HER ORDERS WHILE SHE TELLING HER COUSIN OF THE EARL'S APPROVAL

AND THERE MET SIR GALAHAD AN OLD MAN CLOTHED IN RELIGIOUS CLOTHING AND SAID SIR HAVE HERE THE KEYS OF THIS CASTLE THEN SIR GALAHAD OPENED THE GATES AND SAW SO MUCH PEOPLE IN THE STREETS THAT HE MIGHT NOT NUMBER THEM AND ALL SAID
SIR SAID THE GENTLEWOMAN THAT YE SEND AFTER ALL THE KNIGHTS HITHER THAT HOLD THEIR LANDS OF THIS CASTLE AND MAKE THEM TO SWEAR FOR TO USE THE CUSTOMS THAT WERE USED HERETOFORE OF OLD TIME I WILL WELL SAID GALAHAD AND THERE SHE BROUGHT HIM AN HORN OF IVORY
AND I NAKED AS YE BE WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO ME NOW BY YOUR TRUE KNIGHTHOOD
THROUGH THE HOLY VESSEL I AM HEALED BUT I HAVE MARVEL OF THIS SLEEPING KNIGHT THAT HAD NO POWER TO AWAKE WHEN THIS HOLY VESSEL WAS BROUGHT HITHER I DARE RIGHT WELL SAY SAID THE SQUIRE THAT HE DWELLETH IN SOME DEADLY SIN WHEREOF HE WAS NEVER CONFESSED
AND WHEN SIR LAUNCELOT HEARD THIS HE WAS PASSING HEAVY AND WIST NOT WHAT TO DO AND SO DEPARTED SORE WEEPING AND CURSED THE TIME THAT HE WAS BORN FOR THEN HE DEEMED NEVER TO HAVE HAD WORSHIP MORE
BY MY FAITH SAID THE KNIGHT WHATSOMEVER HE BE HE IS UNHAPPY FOR AS I DEEM HE IS OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE ROUND TABLE THE WHICH IS ENTERED INTO THE QUEST OF THE SANGREAL SIR SAID THE SQUIRE
BUT THAT WE MAY BE FRIENDS ALL THAT I HAVE OFFENDED IS AND WAS FOR THE LOVE OF LA BEALE ISOUD AND AS FOR HER I DARE SAY SHE IS PEERLESS ABOVE ALL OTHER LADIES AND ALSO I PROFFERED HER NEVER NO DISHONOUR
WHY SAID GALAHAD WILL YE ALL HAVE ADO WITH ME AT ONCE
SHORTLY AFTER OUR MARRIAGE ALAS SIR WHAT SHALL I SAY NOW LOVE BLINDED ME I FELL INTO THE ABYSS I BELIEVED HIM I AGREED TO EVERYTHING HE GAVE ME THE PAPER WHICH YOU HAVE READ
I WAS IN ECSTACY I ENTREATED HER TO SING AFTER SOME LITTLE CEREMONY
AND I SAW THAT IT CONTAINED A PORTRAIT EXACTLY LIKE HER
BUT IN VAIN OH WHAT A CRUEL LONG NIGHT IT WAS IN THE MORNING I HEARD THAT THE MONSTER HAD GONE AWAY WITH HIS SERVANT ONE HOUR AFTER SEALING MY SHAME YOU MAY IMAGINE MY DESPAIR I ADOPTED THE ONLY PLAN THAT DESPAIR COULD SUGGEST
IT IS MUCH BETTER STILL TO AVOID THAT FATAL IMPOSSIBILITY BY NEVER PLAYING OTHERWISE THAN WITH MONEY IN HAND NO DOUBT OF IT FOR THEN YOU WILL SAVE BOTH YOUR HONOUR AND YOUR PURSE BUT AS YOU ARE FOND OF GAMES OF CHANCE I ADVISE YOU NEVER TO PUNT
AND SHE SANG AT SIGHT IN A MANNER WHICH FAIRLY RAVISHED ME I BEGGED THAT SHE WOULD ALLOW ME TO KISS HER HAND AND SHE DID NOT SAY YES BUT WHEN I TOOK IT AND PRESSED MY LIPS ON IT SHE DID NOT OPPOSE ANY RESISTANCE
SEEING HER ALONE AND OBSERVING HER UNCERTAIN WALK I FELT MYSELF DRAWN TOWARDS HER AS IF AN UNSEEN HAND HAD GUIDED ME I COME UP TO HER AND OFFER MY SERVICES IF I CAN BE OF ANY USE TO HER
BUT YOU HAVE OPENED MY EYES TAKE AWAY I ENTREAT YOU THIS STILETTO WHICH HENCEFORTH IS USELESS TO ME I TRUST IN YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND I HAVE AN INWARD CERTAINTY THAT I SHALL BE INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY HONOUR AS WELL AS FOR MY LIFE
I FELT THAT IT GAVE NEW STRENGTH TO MY HOPES AND THAT FEELING PREVENTED ME FROM REGRETTING MY HEAVY LOSS BUT GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT GENEROSITY OF MY BENEFACTOR I WAS FULLY DETERMINED ON KEEPING MY PROMISE
IN THE EARLY PART OF OCTOBER SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX THE THEATRES BEING OPENED I WAS WALKING ABOUT WITH MY MASK ON WHEN I PERCEIVED A WOMAN WHOSE HEAD WAS WELL ENVELOPED IN THE HOOD OF HER MANTLE GETTING OUT OF THE FERRARA BARGE WHICH HAD JUST ARRIVED
HE EXCUSED HIMSELF IN A VERY POLITE MANNER DROWNING HIS REFUSAL IN THAT SEA OF COMMONPLACES WHICH PEOPLE ARE SURE TO REPEAT WHEN THEY CANNOT OR WILL NOT OBLIGE A FRIEND ZAWOISKI CAME IN AS HE WAS STILL APOLOGIZING AND I LEFT THEM TOGETHER
I NEVER THOUGHT OF INSPIRING HER WITH LOVE FOR ME AND I HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA THAT I COULD FALL IN LOVE WITH HER SHE WAS UNHAPPY AND HER UNHAPPINESS A SACRED THING IN MY EYES
YOUR FAULT WAS THAT OF A WARM HEART SEDUCED BY LOVE OVER WHICH REASON COULD HAVE NO SWAY AND YOUR FLIGHT THE ACTION OF A SOUL CRYING FOR REPARATION OR FOR REVENGE FULLY JUSTIFIES YOU
HAVE THROWN ME INTO THE ABYSS I AM IN YOUR HANDS AND I FEEL CERTAIN THAT I SHALL HAVE NO CAUSE TO REPENT IT I NEEDED ALL SHE HAD JUST TOLD ME TO CONFIRM ME IN THE INTEREST WHICH I HAD FELT IN HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENT
SHE HESITATES I INSIST AND SHE GIVES WAY THE TAVERN WAS CLOSE AT HAND
L'ABBADIE WAS FURIOUS AND HE HAD SOME REASON TO BE SO
AND I PRESENTED HIM TO MY PROTECTOR WHO PROMISED HIM HIS VOTE BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE I AM GOING TO RELATE PREVENTED HIM FROM FULFILLING HIS PROMISE
I MUST THINK OF DEFENDING MYSELF AGAINST MY OWN SELF MUCH MORE THAN AGAINST YOU THE COMPLIMENT STRUCK ME AS SO FINE AND SO COMPLIMENTARY TO ME THAT I THOUGHT IT BETTER NOT TO TAKE IT UP
I HEARD FROM ONE OF HIS MOTHER'S GONDOLIERS THAT HE HAD RETURNED TO VENICE THREE DAYS BEFORE BUT THAT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD GONE AWAY AGAIN WITHOUT ANY SERVANT AND NOBODY KNEW HIS WHEREABOUTS NOT EVEN HIS MOTHER THE SAME EVENING
BUT YOU MAY IMAGINE THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED UPON ME BY THE SUDDEN APPARITION OF A MASKED MAN WHO ABRUPTLY AND AS IF PLACED THERE PURPOSELY BY PROVIDENCE OFFERED ME HIS SERVICES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT YOU HAD GUESSED MY DISTRESS
WITH BLACK HAIR YOU ARE MISTAKEN SHE SAID IT IS A PORTRAIT OF MY BROTHER HE IS TWO YEARS OLDER THAN I AND IS AN OFFICER IN THE PAPAL ARMY I BEGGED HER PERMISSION TO PUT THE RING ON HER FINGER SHE CONSENTED
EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS TRUE MY BROTHER I HOPE WILL AVENGE ME YOU ARE GREATLY MISTAKEN IF YOU IMAGINE THAT STEFFANI WILL FIGHT YOUR BROTHER STEFFANI IS A COWARD WHO WILL NEVER EXPOSE HIMSELF TO AN HONOURABLE DEATH AS I WAS SPEAKING
YET I FELT MY LOVE TAKING SUCH PROPORTIONS THAT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO KEEP IT A MYSTERY ANY LONGER SOON AFTER THAT
HE HAS ALREADY DONE YOU GREAT INJURY AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO FIND HIM AT HOME HE MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF RECEIVING YOU BADLY IF HE SHOULD NOT BE AT HOME IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT HIS MOTHER WOULD NOT EXACTLY WELCOME YOU
AND AS I DID NOT RETURN HOME TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT I WENT TO BED WITHOUT SEEING MY FATHER IN THE MORNING I SAID IN HIS PRESENCE THAT I INTENDED TO CALL UPON L'ABBADIE TO CONGRATULATE HIM UPON HIS APPOINTMENT YOU MAY SPARE YOURSELF THAT TROUBLE
MAY BE SURE THAT OUR PLAYING LAST NIGHT WAS ONLY A JOKE HE OWES ME NOTHING MY WIFE BEGS TO SEND HIM HALF OF THE GOLD WHICH HE HAS LOST IN CASH COUNT RINALDI
OF A YOUNG POLISH NOBLEMAN CALLED ZAWOISKI HE WAS EXPECTING MONEY FROM POLAND BUT IN THE MEAN TIME THE VENETIAN LADIES DID NOT LET HIM WANT FOR ANY BEING ALL VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIS HANDSOME FACE AND HIS POLISH MANNERS
ONE MONTH AGO I HAD NEVER COMMITTED A FAULT WHICH COULD CALL A BLUSH UPON MY FACE AND THE BITTER TEARS WHICH I SHED EVERY DAY WILL I HOPE WASH OUT MY CRIME IN THE EYES OF GOD I HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY BROUGHT UP BUT LOVE AND THE WANT OF EXPERIENCE
PRESENTED ME ONE DAY AS WE WERE OUT WALKING TO AN UNKNOWN COUNTESS WHO TOOK MY FANCY VERY STRONGLY WE CALLED ON HER IN THE EVENING AND AFTER INTRODUCING ME TO HER HUSBAND COUNT RINALDI SHE INVITED US TO REMAIN AND HAVE SUPPER
BUT IF YOU WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO COME WITH ME TO A CAFE
HE SWORE A THOUSAND TIMES THAT HE ADORED ME THAT HIS INTENTIONS WERE HONOURABLE I ENTREATED HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF TO MY PARENTS TO ASK ME IN MARRIAGE
FROM THE NORTH CHAMBERS SINCE HENRI AND HIMSELF HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO RETURN FROM THEM IN SAFETY HENRI HOWEVER WAS LESS SUCCESSFUL IN DISGUISING HIS FEELINGS FROM HIS COUNTENANCE AN EXPRESSION OF TERROR WAS NOT ENTIRELY FADED
I HAVE SOMETIMES KNOWN HER ARGUE NOT ONLY WITH METHOD BUT WITH ACUTENESS AND THEN IN A MOMENT START OFF INTO MADNESS HER CONSCIENCE SEEMS AFFLICTED SAID EMILY DID YOU EVER HEAR WHAT CIRCUMSTANCE REDUCED HER TO THIS DEPLORABLE CONDITION
REPLIED TO THE ENQUIRIES OF THE FORMER THAT SISTER AGNES WAS STILL LIVING AND SENSIBLE BUT THAT IT WAS THOUGHT SHE COULD NOT SURVIVE THE NIGHT IN THE PARLOUR THEY FOUND SEVERAL OF THE BOARDERS WHO REJOICED TO SEE EMILY
AS I HAVE HEARD BESTOWING HER ON A NOBLEMAN WHOM SHE DISLIKED AN ILL GOVERNED PASSION PROVED HER DESTRUCTION EVERY OBLIGATION OF VIRTUE AND OF DUTY WAS FORGOTTEN
IT WAS EVER HER CHIEF CONSOLATION THAT SHE HAD STRICTLY OBEYED HIM IN THIS PARTICULAR LITTLE MORE WAS SAID BY THE ABBESS WHO APPEARED TOO MUCH AFFECTED BY THE SUBJECT SHE HAD LATELY LEFT TO BE WILLING TO CONVERSE
AND TOLD HER MANY LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE CONVENT SINCE HER DEPARTURE AND WHICH WERE INTERESTING TO HER ONLY BECAUSE THEY RELATED TO PERSONS
THAT FEW OF THE PRESENT SISTERHOOD I BELIEVE WERE WITNESSES OF THE CEREMONY NAY EVER OUR LADY MOTHER DID NOT THEN PRESIDE OVER THE CONVENT BUT I CAN REMEMBER WHEN SISTER AGNES WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SHE RETAINS THAT AIR OF HIGH RANK
IN BECOMING OF OUR ORDER AT LENGTH UNSETTLED HER REASON AT FIRST SHE WAS FRANTIC AND MELANCHOLY BY QUICK ALTERNATIVES THEN SHE SUNK INTO A DEEP AND SETTLED MELANCHOLY WHICH STILL HOWEVER HAS AT TIMES
O DO NOT FROWN SO STERNLY HAH THERE AGAIN TIL SHE HERSELF WHY DO YOU LOOK SO PITEOUSLY UPON ME AND SMILE TOO SMILE ON ME WHAT GROAN WAS THAT
AND EXPRESSING THEIR ADMIRATION OF HIS INTREPIDITY IN HAVING DARED TO PASS A NIGHT IN THE APARTMENT WHENCE LUDOVICO HAD DISAPPEARED FOR SHE HAD NOT CONSIDERED WITH WHAT RAPIDITY A TALE OF WONDER CIRCULATES THE NUNS HAD ACQUIRED THEIR INFORMATION FROM PEASANTS
OR TO THINK OF HER MORE DURING THE LIFE OF HIS FATHER HE HAD OBSERVED THE FIRST COMMAND BUT HAD FOUND IT IMPRACTICABLE TO OBEY THE SECOND AND HAD SOMETIMES SOOTHED HIS PASSION BY VISITING HER FAVOURITE HAUNTS
AND DROP THIS UNUSUAL RESERVE HOWEVER YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO SUSPECT
AND MY PRESENT RESERVE CANNOT MAKE YOU QUESTION EITHER MY ESTEEM OR THE SINCERITY OF MY FRIENDSHIP I WILL NOT DOUBT EITHER SAID THE BARON THOUGH YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO EXPRESS MY SURPRISE AT THIS SILENCE
GRATITUDE AND PITY LEAD TO LOVE WHEN HER IMAGINATION IS RESCUED FROM ITS PRESENT DELUSION
THE DIM LAMP THAT GAVE LIGHT TO THE PLACE TURNING HER EYES AS THE DOOR OPENED SHE BECKONED TO EMILY TO COME IN WHO HAVING DONE SO SEATED HERSELF IN SILENCE BESIDE THE NUN'S LITTLE MATTRESS OF STRAW
AS THE DIGNITY OF HER AIR MUST ALREADY HAVE INFORMED YOU BUT I WILL NOT DISHONOUR THEIR NAME SO MUCH AS TO REVEAL IT LOVE WAS THE OCCASION OF HER CRIME AND OF HER MADNESS SHE WAS BELOVED BY A GENTLEMAN OF INFERIOR FORTUNE AND HER FATHER
WITHOUT OBSERVING HER EMOTION SAT DOWN ON THE MATTRESS BY HER SAYING YOUR CURIOSITY SISTER HAS MADE YOU PUNCTUAL BUT YOU HAVE NOTHING REMARKABLE TO HEAR IN THE HISTORY OF POOR AGNES OF WHOM I AVOIDED TO SPEAK IN THE PRESENCE OF MY LAY SISTERS
WHO BROUGHT FRUIT TO THE MONASTERY AND WHOSE WHOLE ATTENTION HAD BEEN FIXED SINCE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF LUDOVICO ON WHAT WAS PASSING IN THE CASTLE EMILY LISTENED IN SILENCE TO THE VARIOUS OPINIONS OF THE NUNS
BUT A MORE THAN COMMON STILLNESS PERVADED THE COURT AND THE CLOISTERS THROUGH WHICH EMILY AND BLANCHE PASSED IN THEIR WAY TO THE GREAT HALL WHERE A NUN
THE DYING MOMENTS OF HER BELOVED FATHER AND SHE WISHED ONCE MORE TO WEEP OVER THE SPOT WHERE HIS REMAINS WERE BURIED DURING THE SILENCE
AS WELL AS TO SEE SOME OF HER FORMER FRIENDS SHE AND THE LADY BLANCHE EXTENDED THEIR WALK TO THE MONASTERY AT THE GATE STOOD A CARRIAGE WHICH FROM THE HEAT OF THE HORSES
WAS NO LONGER WITHIN THE REACH OF HIS VOWS BY WHAT ACCIDENT HE DISCOVERED EMILY AND ASSISTED TO RELEASE HER FROM A TERRIBLE IMPRISONMENT HAS ALREADY APPEARED AND ALSO THE UNAVAILING HOPE WITH WHICH HE THEN ENCOURAGED HIS LOVE
SOON AFTER HE TOOK LEAVE AND WHEN EMILY JOINED SOME OF THE NUNS SHE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THEM ACQUAINTED WITH A CIRCUMSTANCE
AND CALMLY SAID TO AGNES DAUGHTER I HAVE BROUGHT MADEMOISELLE SAINT AUBERT TO VISIT YOU I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER AGNES MADE NO REPLY BUT STILL GAZING WILDLY UPON EMILY EXCLAIMED
BUT HER SPIRITS HAVE BEEN MUCH AGITATED BY THE ARRIVAL OF THE GENTLEMAN SHE WISHED SO MUCH TO SEE YES OBSERVED THE ABBESS THAT HAS UNDOUBTEDLY OCCASIONED THIS PAROXYSM OF FRENZY WHEN SHE IS BETTER
THE NUN AS SHE CONCLUDED UTTERED A SHUDDERING SIGH THAT STARTLED EMILY WHO LOOKING UP PERCEIVED THE EYES OF AGNES FIXED ON HERS AFTER WHICH THE SISTER ROSE TOOK HER HAND GAZED EARNESTLY UPON HER COUNTENANCE
AMONG WHICH WAS THE FISHING HOUSE WHERE ONCE OR TWICE HE ADDRESSED HER IN VERSE CONCEALING HIS NAME IN OBEDIENCE TO THE PROMISE HE HAD GIVEN HIS FATHER THERE TOO HE PLAYED THE PATHETIC AIR TO WHICH SHE HAD LISTENED WITH SUCH SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION
UPON WHICH HER EYE HAD INVOLUNTARILY GLANCED AND THOUGH THEY NOW AND INDEED WHENEVER SHE REMEMBERED THEM REVIVED AN EXCESS OF PAINFUL CURIOSITY CONCERNING THEIR FULL IMPORT AND THE MOTIVES FOR HER FATHER'S COMMAND
YES FOR REAL RUSSIANS THE QUESTIONS OF GOD'S EXISTENCE AND OF IMMORTALITY OR AS YOU SAY THE SAME QUESTIONS TURNED INSIDE OUT COME FIRST AND FOREMOST OF COURSE AND SO THEY SHOULD SAID ALYOSHA
OF MY LOVE IF YOU LIKE I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE YOUNG LADY I WORRIED MYSELF OVER HER AND SHE WORRIED ME I SAT WATCHING OVER HER AND ALL AT ONCE IT'S COLLAPSED I SPOKE THIS MORNING WITH INSPIRATION BUT I WENT AWAY AND ROARED WITH LAUGHTER WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT
WHEN I WENT AWAY TO MOSCOW FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS I NEVER THOUGHT OF YOU AT ALL THEN WHEN YOU CAME TO MOSCOW YOURSELF WE ONLY MET ONCE SOMEWHERE I BELIEVE AND NOW I'VE BEEN HERE MORE THAN THREE MONTHS AND SO FAR WE HAVE SCARCELY SAID A WORD TO EACH OTHER TO MORROW I AM GOING AWAY
HE LOOKED AT THEM AND A NEW IDEA SEEMED TO DAWN UPON HIM SO THAT HE APPARENTLY FORGOT HIS GRIEF FOR A MINUTE GRADUALLY HE SEEMED TO SINK INTO BROODING AND DID NOT RESIST WHEN THE COFFIN WAS LIFTED UP AND CARRIED TO THE GRAVE
IF THERE WERE NO GOD HE WOULD HAVE TO BE INVENTED
IS THAT IT NO THEN YOU KNOW WHAT FOR IT'S DIFFERENT FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT WE IN OUR GREEN YOUTH HAVE TO SETTLE THE ETERNAL QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL
IT'S ALL TOO FUNNY AH ALYOSHA IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW LIGHT MY HEART IS NOW WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT I SAT HERE EATING MY DINNER AND WAS NEARLY ORDERING CHAMPAGNE TO CELEBRATE MY FIRST HOUR OF FREEDOM TFOO IT'S BEEN GOING ON NEARLY SIX MONTHS
THEN HE WAS REMINDED THAT HE MUST CRUMBLE THE BREAD AND HE WAS AWFULLY EXCITED SNATCHED UP THE BREAD AND BEGAN PULLING IT TO PIECES AND FLINGING THE MORSELS ON THE GRAVE COME FLY DOWN BIRDS FLY DOWN SPARROWS HE MUTTERED ANXIOUSLY
THE BOYS RAISED THE COFFIN BUT AS THEY PASSED THE MOTHER THEY STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND LOWERED IT THAT SHE MIGHT SAY GOOD BY TO ILUSHA BUT ON SEEING THAT PRECIOUS LITTLE FACE WHICH FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS SHE HAD ONLY LOOKED AT FROM A DISTANCE
BEGIN WHERE YOU LIKE YOU DECLARED YESTERDAY AT FATHER'S THAT THERE WAS NO GOD ALYOSHA LOOKED SEARCHINGLY AT HIS BROTHER I SAID THAT YESTERDAY AT DINNER ON PURPOSE TO TEASE YOU AND I SAW YOUR EYES GLOW
I KNOW THAT MY YOUTH WILL TRIUMPH OVER EVERYTHING EVERY DISILLUSIONMENT EVERY DISGUST WITH LIFE I'VE ASKED MYSELF MANY TIMES WHETHER THERE IS IN THE WORLD ANY DESPAIR THAT WOULD OVERCOME THIS FRANTIC AND PERHAPS UNSEEMLY THIRST FOR LIFE IN ME
IT WAS AN OLD AND RATHER POOR CHURCH MANY OF THE IKONS WERE WITHOUT SETTINGS BUT SUCH CHURCHES ARE THE BEST FOR PRAYING IN DURING THE MASS SNEGIRYOV BECAME SOMEWHAT CALMER THOUGH AT TIMES HE HAD OUTBURSTS OF THE SAME UNCONSCIOUS AND AS IT WERE INCOHERENT ANXIETY
BUT HE BEGGED ME NOT TO TELL DMITRI THAT HE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT HIM ADDED ALYOSHA
I COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED EVEN YESTERDAY HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO PUT AN END TO IT IF I WANTED
AND THEN TO SAY GOOD BY I BELIEVE IT'S ALWAYS BEST TO GET TO KNOW PEOPLE JUST BEFORE LEAVING THEM I'VE NOTICED HOW YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT ME THESE THREE MONTHS THERE HAS BEEN A CONTINUAL LOOK OF EXPECTATION IN YOUR EYES AND I CAN'T ENDURE THAT
ME LAUGHING I DON'T WANT TO WOUND MY LITTLE BROTHER WHO HAS BEEN WATCHING ME WITH SUCH EXPECTATION FOR THREE MONTHS ALYOSHA LOOK STRAIGHT AT ME OF COURSE I AM JUST SUCH A LITTLE BOY AS YOU ARE ONLY NOT A NOVICE
IT'S A FEATURE OF THE KARAMAZOVS IT'S TRUE THAT THIRST FOR LIFE REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IT NO DOUBT TOO BUT WHY IS IT BASE THE CENTRIPETAL FORCE ON OUR PLANET IS STILL FEARFULLY STRONG ALYOSHA I HAVE A LONGING FOR LIFE AND I GO ON LIVING IN SPITE OF LOGIC
AS WE ALL KNOW HE CREATED IT ACCORDING TO THE GEOMETRY OF EUCLID AND THE HUMAN MIND WITH THE CONCEPTION OF ONLY THREE DIMENSIONS IN SPACE YET THERE HAVE BEEN AND STILL ARE GEOMETRICIANS AND PHILOSOPHERS AND EVEN SOME OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED
NOBODY DIES OF HYSTERICS THOUGH THEY DON'T MATTER GOD GAVE WOMAN HYSTERICS AS A RELIEF I WON'T GO TO HER AT ALL WHY PUSH MYSELF FORWARD AGAIN BUT YOU TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD NEVER CARED FOR YOU I DID THAT ON PURPOSE ALYOSHA
ALYOSHA TOLD HIM SHE HAD BEEN HYSTERICAL AND THAT SHE WAS NOW HE HEARD UNCONSCIOUS AND DELIRIOUS ISN'T MADAME HOHLAKOV LAYING IT ON I THINK NOT I MUST FIND OUT
YOU WON'T BE ANGRY ALYOSHA LAUGHED TOO WELL THAT YOU ARE JUST AS YOUNG AS OTHER YOUNG MEN OF THREE AND TWENTY THAT YOU ARE JUST A YOUNG AND FRESH AND NICE BOY GREEN IN FACT NOW HAVE I INSULTED YOU DREADFULLY
EVEN IF THEY ARE SUCH LITTLE FELLOWS AS YOU YOUR EXPECTANT EYES CEASED TO ANNOY ME I GREW FOND OF THEM IN THE END THOSE EXPECTANT EYES YOU SEEM TO LOVE ME FOR SOME REASON ALYOSHA
I AM ALWAYS MANLY BUT THIS IS AWFUL KARAMAZOV IF I AM NOT KEEPING YOU ONE QUESTION BEFORE YOU GO IN WHAT IS IT KOLYA SAID ALYOSHA IS YOUR BROTHER INNOCENT OR GUILTY WAS IT HE KILLED YOUR FATHER OR WAS IT THE VALET AS YOU SAY
WELL ONLY FANCY
ONE OF THE BOYS OBSERVED THAT IT WAS AWKWARD FOR HIM TO CRUMBLE THE BREAD WITH THE FLOWERS IN HIS HANDS AND SUGGESTED HE SHOULD GIVE THEM TO SOME ONE TO HOLD FOR A TIME BUT HE WOULD NOT DO THIS AND SEEMED INDEED SUDDENLY ALARMED FOR HIS FLOWERS AS THOUGH THEY WANTED TO TAKE THEM FROM HIM ALTOGETHER
THOUGH HE IS RUINED HE IS HAPPY I COULD ENVY HIM WHAT DO YOU MEAN HOW CAN YOU WHY CRIED ALYOSHA SURPRISED OH IF I TOO COULD SACRIFICE MYSELF SOME DAY FOR TRUTH SAID KOLYA WITH ENTHUSIASM
BUT NOW I'VE NO OBJECTION TO DISCUSSING WITH YOU AND I SAY SO VERY SERIOUSLY
THOUGH I'VE LONG CEASED PERHAPS TO HAVE FAITH IN THEM YET FROM OLD HABIT ONE'S HEART PRIZES THEM HERE THEY HAVE BROUGHT THE SOUP FOR YOU EAT IT IT WILL DO YOU GOOD IT'S FIRST RATE SOUP THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT HERE I WANT TO TRAVEL IN EUROPE ALYOSHA
THAT'S A SURPRISE FOR YOU ISN'T IT YES OF COURSE IF YOU ARE NOT JOKING NOW JOKING I WAS TOLD AT THE ELDER'S YESTERDAY THAT I WAS JOKING YOU KNOW DEAR BOY THERE WAS AN OLD SINNER IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WHO DECLARED THAT
AT THE MOMENT OF ETERNAL HARMONY SOMETHING SO PRECIOUS WILL COME TO PASS THAT IT WILL SUFFICE FOR ALL HEARTS FOR THE COMFORTING OF ALL RESENTMENTS FOR THE ATONEMENT OF ALL THE CRIMES OF HUMANITY OF ALL THE BLOOD THEY'VE SHED
THE FORLORN SILENCE OF THOSE WHO ARE BEREFT OF HOPE AND HAVE ALMOST CEASED TO CARE PRESENTLY EGBERT STARTED FROM HIS SEAT WITH AN AIR OF RESOLUTION THE LIGHT OF BATTLE WAS IN HIS EYES LET ME COME TO THE WRITING TABLE HE EXCLAIMED GLADLY SAID JANETTA
I DONT DISPUTE THE NECESSITY BUT I DONT THINK THE SOME ONE SHOULD BE ME SAID JANETTA I WOULDNT MIND WRITING A LETTER OF ANGRY RECRIMINATION OR HEARTLESS SATIRE TO SOME SUITABLE RECIPIENT IN FACT I SHOULD RATHER ENJOY IT
IN MY QUALITY OF PIERROT I HAD NO WEAPONS I SEIZED HIM ROUND THE WAIST AND CARRIED HIM ROUND THE PARLOUR RUNNING ALL THE TIME WHILE HE KEPT ON FLOGGING ME I THEN PUT HIM DOWN ADROITLY SNATCHING HIS WAND OUT OF HIS HAND I LIFTED HIS COLUMBINE ON MY SHOULDERS AND PURSUED HIM
THAT WISH OF YOURS TO GIVE ME UP YOUR PLACE WHEN YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT I WAS HAPPY WITH M M AROSE FROM YOUR FRIENDSHIP RATHER THAN FROM YOUR LOVE AND FOR THE PRESENT I MUST BE GLAD TO SEE THAT YOUR FRIENDSHIP IS STRONGER THAN YOUR LOVE
OH SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE NEW YEAR HONOURS LIST A FRIEND OF OURS MADE SUCH A CLEVER REMARK WHEN HE READ IT THEN YOU CAN STICK IN ANY REMARK THAT COMES INTO YOUR HEAD IT NEEDNT BE CLEVER THE FROPLINSONS WONT KNOW WHETHER IT IS OR ISNT
AND I STOPPED NEAR THE DANCERS AFTER I HAD EXAMINED THE PANTALOONS PUNCHES HARLEQUINS AND MERRY ANDREWS I WENT NEAR THE GRATING WHERE I SAW ALL THE NUNS AND BOARDERS SOME SEATED SOME STANDING AND WITHOUT APPEARING TO NOTICE ANY OF THEM IN PARTICULAR
ENTERED THE SANCTUARY AND SAW MY DIVINITY LEANING AGAINST THE MANTELPIECE SHE WORE HER CONVENT DRESS I COME NEAR HER BY STEALTH IN ORDER TO ENJOY HER SURPRISE I LOOK AT HER AND I REMAIN PETRIFIED ASTOUNDED THE PERSON I SEE IS NOT M M
I WENT AT ONCE TO THE CONVENT THE PARLOUR WAS FULL BUT THANKS TO MY COSTUME OF PIERROT WHICH WAS SEEN IN VENICE BUT VERY SELDOM EVERYBODY MADE ROOM FOR ME I WALKED ON ASSUMING THE GAIT OF A BOOBY THE TRUE CHARACTERISTIC OF MY COSTUME
THE PERMISSION WAS GRANTED AND YOU CANNOT IMAGINE OUR PLEASURE IN SEEING OURSELVES AT LIBERTY FOR THE FIRST TIME TO SLEEP IN THE SAME BED TO DAY SHORTLY AFTER YOU HAD LEFT THE PARLOUR WHERE YOU SO MUCH AMUSED US WITHOUT OUR DISCOVERING THAT THE DELIGHTFUL PIERROT WAS OUR FRIEND
YOU PLEAD THE CAUSE OF YOUR FRIEND WITH THE ELOQUENCE OF AN ANGEL BUT DEAR LITTLE WIFE YOU DO NOT SEE THE AFFAIR IN ITS PROPER LIGHT YOU HAVE INTELLIGENCE AND A PURE SOUL BUT YOU HAVE NOT MY EXPERIENCE
MY DEAR M M RETIRED TO HER ROOM AND I FOLLOWED HER THE MOMENT WE WERE ALONE SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WANTED ME TO RENDER HER A SERVICE FROM WHICH DEPENDED OUR HAPPINESS I NEED NOT TELL YOU HOW READILY I ANSWERED THAT SHE HAD ONLY TO NAME IT
M M IS AFTER ME THE ONLY WOMAN WORTHY OF YOUR LOVE THE ONLY ONE WITH WHOM I COULD CONSENT TO SHARE IT I USED TO PITY YOU BUT I DO SO NO LONGER AND YOUR HAPPINESS MAKES ME HAPPY KISS ME NOW
AND WITH SUCH AN AIR OF STUPIDITY THAT EVERYBODY LAUGHED AND MADE ROOM FOR US MY PARTNER DANCED VERY WELL ACCORDING TO HER COSTUME AND I KEPT MY CHARACTER WITH SUCH PERFECTION THAT THE LAUGHTER WAS GENERAL
AS TO BE DECEIVED BY ALL THIS AFFAIR I AM MISERABLE AND IT IS HER DOING THEN I SHOULD BE RIGHT IF I COMPLAINED OF HER ALSO BECAUSE SHE MAKES ME FEEL THAT SHE IS THE MISTRESS OF MY LOVER AND SHE SHEWS ME THAT AFTER SEDUCING HIM FROM ME
MOST LIKELY SHE MEANT TO PROVE THAT SHE LOVED YOU FOR YOUR OWN SAKE THAT YOUR HAPPINESS MAKES HER HAPPY AND THAT SHE IS NOT JEALOUS OF HER BEST FRIEND BEING HER RIVAL TO CONVINCE YOU THAT YOU OUGHT NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH HER FOR HAVING DISCOVERED OUR SECRET
WHEN HE SAID NINEPENCE I GAVE HIM THEIR ADDRESS JABBED OUR CARD IN PAID TENPENCE OR ELEVENPENCE TO COVER THE POSTAGE AND THANKED HEAVEN WITH LESS SINCERITY AND INFINITELY MORE TROUBLE THEY EVENTUALLY THANKED ME THE FROPLINSONS DONT PLAY BRIDGE SAID EGBERT
BELIEVE ME DEAREST I AM SICK FROM UNHAPPINESS I LOVE YOU WITH MY WHOLE SOUL BUT I AM IN SUCH A SITUATION THAT WHAT YOU ARE WEEPING MY LOVE OH I ENTREAT YOU SPARE MY HEART I AM SO SORRY TO HAVE TOLD YOU SUCH A THING
AND LAUGHING AT ALL THOSE REASONABLE BEINGS WHO EXERCISE THEIR REASON TO AVOID THE MISFORTUNES WHICH THEY FEAR DESTROYING AT THE SAME TIME THE PLEASURE THAT THEY MIGHT ENJOY
A WORDSWORTH BOOKLET NEXT CHRISTMAS AND ANOTHER CALENDAR THE CHRISTMAS AFTER WITH THE SAME PROBLEM OF HAVING TO WRITE SUITABLE LETTERS OF THANKFULNESS NO THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO DROP ALL FURTHER ALLUSION TO THE CALENDAR AND SWITCH OFF ON TO SOME OTHER TOPIC BUT WHAT OTHER TOPIC
I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN OUR PASSING A WHOLE NIGHT TOGETHER AS INNOCENTLY AS IF WE WERE BROTHER AND SISTER IF SHE KNOWS YOU AS WELL AS I DO SHE WILL INDEED THINK IT MOST WONDERFUL IN THAT CASE YOU MAY TELL HER THE CONTRARY IF YOU LIKE
AND SOME CONVENTIONAL HIEROGLYPHIC TO SHOW THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO BE A CHRISTMAS OR NEW YEAR GIFT THERE WOULD BE A COUNTERFOIL WITH SPACE FOR THE RECIPIENTS NAME AND THE DATE OF ARRIVAL AND ALL YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO WOULD BE TO SIGN AND DATE THE COUNTERFOIL ADD A CONVENTIONAL HIEROGLYPHIC
EVERYBODY LAUGHED LOUDLY AND IMPROVING MY OPPORTUNITY I RAN THROUGH THE CROWD AND DISAPPEARED I WAS IN A PERSPIRATION AND THE WEATHER WAS COLD I THREW MYSELF INTO A GONDOLA AND IN ORDER NOT TO GET CHILLED I LANDED AT THE RIDOTTO
YOU WILL REACH IT IN FIVE MINUTES YOU WILL STEP OUT AND ENTER A SMALL APARTMENT WHERE YOU WILL FIND A GOOD FIRE YOU WILL BE ALONE AND YOU WILL WAIT FOR WHOM I ENQUIRED FOR NOBODY YOU NEED NOT KNOW ANY MORE
BUT I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE SORRY WHEN M M FEELS THE SAME I LOVE HER WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF MARRYING HER DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME DEAREST AS FOR YOU KNOWING THAT YOU MUST BE MY WIFE I AM CERTAIN OF OUR LOVE WHICH PRACTICE WILL ANIMATE WITH NEW LIFE
AFTER ASSURING HER THAT I NO LONGER ENTERTAINED ANY DOUBT OF HER INNOCENCE I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THE BEHAVIOUR OF HER FRIEND VERY AMBIGUOUS I SAID THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE PLEASURE I FELT IN SEEING HER THE TRICK PLAYED UPON ME BY HER FRIEND WAS A VERY BAD ONE
WITH A QUOTATION OF ONE OF HIS GREAT THOUGHTS FOR EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR IMPOSSIBLE SAID EGBERT HE DIDNT HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUGHTS IN THE WHOLE OF HIS LIFE OR IF HE DID HE KEPT THEM TO HIMSELF HE WAS A MAN OF ACTION NOT OF INTROSPECTION
OH HANG IT ALL MY LAD CRIED THE MASTER IN DISAPPOINTED TONES DON'T SAY THAT BUT I DO CRIED ARCHY THERE OUGHT TO BE A TRAP DOOR COVERED WITH STONES LEADING DOWN A PLACE LIKE A WELL YES THAT'S WHAT WE'VE COME DOWN
AND THAT'S THE PLACE LOOK HERE MISTER GURR
AND THEY THEMSELVES HUNT SAND HOPPERS AND EAT ANYTHING THEY CAN FIND OR STEAL SO THEY GROW BIGGER AND THEN LIKE THE BOY WHO GROWS QUICKLY THE CRAB FINDS HIS SHELLY SUIT A SIZE TOO SMALL FOR HIM NOW LOOK AT HIS SUIT IT IS A HARD COAT
BLESS ME TOO HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF ALL THESE THINGS MATURELY CONSIDERED THEM YET HE WOULD NOT YIELD TO THE MIGHT OF THE STRANGERS THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS MAN AND ALL HIS RACE WAS IN HIS EYES THE HOLIEST MOST URGENT DUTY
FOR THAT IF THEY DID NOT OBEY GOD HEREIN THEY SHOULD BE PUNISHED SO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL CAME TOGETHER TO THEIR ASSEMBLY AND CONSIDERED OF THESE MATTERS WHEN A MAN WHOSE NAME WAS BERECHIAH AND WHO WAS ONE OF CHIEF REPUTATION IN THE GOVERNMENT
AND FORBADE THEM TO BRING IN THE APPOINTED SACRIFICES AND TOOK AWAY THE GIFTS THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO IT
BUT WHEN PUL KING OF ASSYRIA HAD MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT THINK MEET TO FIGHT OR ENGAGE IN BATTLE WITH THE ASSYRIANS BUT HE PERSUADED HIM TO ACCEPT OF A THOUSAND TALENTS OF SILVER AND TO GO AWAY AND SO PUT AN END TO THE WAR
THE POPULACE MIGHT HAVE WREAKED THEIR UTMOST FURY ON THE OTHER HEBREWS BUT NOT UPON NUN WHOSE SON HOSEA HAD BEEN HIS COMRADE IN ARMS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED LEADERS IN THE ARMY AND AN INTIMATE FAMILY FRIEND
HI IN THERE DO YOU SURRENDER THERE WAS NOT A SOUND AND AFTER A MOMENTARY PAUSE THE MASTER SPAT IN HIS FIST GRIPPED HIS CUTLASS
WHY DOES THE CRAB HAVE TO CHANGE ITS SHELL FOUR WHY DOES IT HIDE AWAY AT THAT TIME FIVE OF WHAT USE ARE SHORE CRABS
NO THE PLACE IS DARK AS PITCH AND WE HAVE NO LIGHTS
THE OWNER USUALLY OVERLOOKED THE DEPARTURE OF THE FLOCKS AND HERDS AND THE MOB HAD MARKED HIM AND HIS FAMILY FOR THE FIRST VICTIMS OF THEIR FURY THE SWIFTEST OF THE AVENGERS HAD NOW REACHED HIS EXTENSIVE FARM BUILDINGS AMONG THEM HORNECHT
AND HAD DRIVEN AWAY MUCH PREY HE RETURNED WITH HIS ARMY BACK TO DAMASCUS NOW WHEN THE KING OF JERUSALEM KNEW THAT THE SYRIANS WERE RETURNED HOME HE SUPPOSING HIMSELF A MATCH FOR THE KING OF ISRAEL DREW OUT HIS ARMY AGAINST HIM
HE ALSO MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE AMMONITES AND OVERCAME THEM IN BATTLE AND ORDERED THEM TO PAY TRIBUTE A HUNDRED TALENTS AND TEN THOUSAND CORI OF WHEAT AND AS MANY OF BARLEY EVERY YEAR
HERE THEY EAT FIGHT GROW AND CHANGE THEIR COATS JUST AS THE YOUNG CRABS DO THEY ARE NOW LIKE THEIR PARENTS SOMETIMES THEY GROW TO BE HUGE AND TO WEIGH AS MUCH AS TEN AND A HALF POUNDS
ONE TRYING TO STEAL THE OTHER'S SHELL OUR COLOURED PICTURE PAGE THIRTY FIVE SHOWS SOME HERMITS AT WAR FIGHTING HOUSE HUNTING AND MOVING HOUSE SEEM TO BE THE HERMIT'S FAVOURITE PURSUITS
AND HE CARRIED THEM WITH HIM AND CAME TO DAMASCUS AND GAVE IT TO THE KING OF ASSYRIA ACCORDING TO HIS AGREEMENT SO HE CONFESSED THAT HE OWED HIM THANKS FOR ALL HE HAD DONE FOR HIM AND RETURNED TO JERUSALEM
HE MET THE ARMY BEFORE THE CITY WALLS AND WITH A LOUD VOICE TOLD THEM THAT THEY HAD GOTTEN THE VICTORY NOT BY THEIR OWN STRENGTH BUT BY REASON OF THE ANGER GOD HAD AGAINST KING AHAZ
WHOSE NAME WAS NAHUM WHO SPAKE AFTER THIS MANNER CONCERNING THE OVERTHROW OF THE ASSYRIANS AND OF NINEVEH
AND UPON RECEIVING THIS INFORMATION THE MASTER SPREAD HIS MEN OUT A FEW YARDS APART TO SWEEP THE GROUND AFTER THE FASHION OBSERVED ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT YOU MUST FIND IT NOW MY LADS HE SAID
WHO LAID SNARES FOR HIM NOW THIS PEKAH HELD THE GOVERNMENT TWENTY YEARS AND PROVED A WICKED MAN AND A TRANSGRESSOR
HE IMITATED THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AND REARED ALTARS IN JERUSALEM AND OFFERED SACRIFICES UPON THEM TO IDOLS TO WHICH ALSO HE OFFERED HIS OWN SON AS A BURNT OFFERING ACCORDING TO THE PRACTICES OF THE CANAANITES
FOR THE TRAP DOOR IF THAT WAS THE SPOT WHERE IT LAY WAS COVERED AND THEREFORE THE MEN COULD NOT BE IN THE CAVE BAD JOB WE'VE GOT NO LANTHORNS SAID GURR WHO WAS LOOKING OVER ARCHY'S SHOULDER
EXERCISES ONE WHAT IS A CRAB LARVA LIKE TWO GIVE THE NAMES OF FOUR CRUSTACEANS THREE
AND THE ROUGH TRAP DOOR WAS LAID BARE THE TWO BOLTS BY WHICH IT WAS SECURED WERE SEEN TO BE UNFASTENED AND THE LOCK UNSHOT NO WAY OUT MISTER RAYSTOKE IS THERE NO THEN WE'VE GOT EM TRAPPED SAFE THIS TIME SAID GURR AS THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN
AS THE PROPHETS ASSURE US NOR OUGHT WE THEREFORE TO INTRODUCE THE PRACTICE OF NEW CRIMES WHEN THE SOLDIERS HEARD THAT THEY PERMITTED THEM TO DO WHAT THEY THOUGHT BEST
HOW THE WORKMAN HAD GRASPED A HATCHET THE HOUSEWIFE AN AXE THEY THEMSELVES SCARCELY KNEW THEY WERE DASHING FORWARD TO DEAL DEATH AND RUIN AND HAD HAD NO OCCASION TO SEARCH FOR WEAPONS THEY HAD BEEN CLOSE AT HAND
AND THE REGION BEYOND JORDAN AND THE ADJOINING COUNTRY WHICH IS CALLED GALILEE
THE MOTHER LOBSTER CARRIES AS MANY AS THIRTY THOUSAND EGGS UNDER HER BODY NEEDLESS TO SAY A VERY VERY FEW OF THIS ENORMOUS FAMILY SURVIVE THE DANGERS OF THE SEA THE RULE THERE IS EAT AND BE EATEN
BLESS ME TOO PHARAOH HAD UTTERED THEM AND THE ENTREATY HAD BEEN ADDRESSED NEITHER TO OLD RUI THE CHIEF PRIEST NOR TO HIMSELF THE ONLY PERSONS WHO COULD POSSESS THE PRIVILEGE OF BLESSING THE MONARCH
WHOM HE RECOGNIZED AS THE LEADER OF THE BAND THAT HAD NEARLY RIDDEN HIM DOWN AT THE GAP WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING FOR YOUNG DAVE TOLLIVER THE AUTUMN BEFORE THAT DOUBTLESS WAS YOUNG BUCK
SO HALE STARTED ON THE TWO BOYS FOLLOWING THE MULE WAS SLOW AND BEING IN A HURRY HALE URGED HIM WITH HIS WHIP EVERY TIME HE STRUCK THE BEAST WOULD KICK UP AND ONCE THE GIRL CAME NEAR GOING OFF YOU MUST WATCH OUT WHEN I HIT HIM SAID HALE
ON ONE CORNER OF THE SQUARE HE COULD SEE THE CHIEF STORE OF THE TOWN MARKED BUCK FALIN GENERAL MERCHANDISE AND THE BIG MAN IN THE DOOR WITH THE BUSHY REDHEAD HE GUESSED WAS THE LEADER OF THE FALIN CLAN OUTSIDE THE DOOR STOOD A SMALLER REPLICA OF THE SAME FIGURE
CERTAINLY DID YOU TELL THE RED FOX THAT DAY YOU SEED HIM WHEN YOU WAS GOIN OVER TO THE GAP LAST FALL THAT YOU SEED ME AT UNCLE JUDD'S NO SAID HALE BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT I SAW THE RED FOX THAT DAY THE BOY LAUGHED UNPLEASANTLY
THAT'S RIGHT THE TROUBLE IN THE MOUNTAINS IS THAT YOU GIRLS MARRY SO EARLY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET AN EDUCATION SHE WASN'T GOING TO MARRY EARLY SHE SAID BUT HALE LEARNED NOW THAT SHE HAD A SWEETHEART WHO HAD BEEN IN TOWN THAT DAY AND APPARENTLY THE TWO HAD HAD A QUARREL WHO IT WAS SHE WOULD NOT TELL
IN EVERY DOORWAY STOOD A MAN CAUTIOUSLY LOOKING ON AND IN A HOTEL WINDOW HE SAW A WOMAN'S FRIGHTENED FACE IT WAS SO STILL THAT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT A TRAGEDY COULD BE IMMINENT AND YET WHILE HE WAS TRYING TO TAKE THE CONDITIONS IN ONE OF THE QUARRELLING MEN
FROM THE LANDLORD AND WHEN THE BEAST WAS BROUGHT AROUND HE OVERHEARD TWO MEN TALKING AT THE END OF THE PORCH
AN ATMOSPHERIC DIFFERENCE HE FELT AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE DOOR THE CROWD HAD MELTED FROM THE SQUARE THERE WERE NO WOMEN IN SIGHT BUT EIGHT ARMED MEN WERE IN FRONT OF THE DOOR AND TWO OF THEM A RED FALIN AND A BLACK TOLLIVER BAD RUFE IT WAS WERE QUARRELLING
HAVEN'T YOU GOT SOME KINFOLKS OVER THE MOUNTAIN YES I GOT AN UNCLE LIVIN OVER THAR DEVIL JUDD FOLKS CALLS HIM SAID THE GIRL SIMPLY THIS GIRL WAS COUSIN TO LITTLE JUNE IN LONESOME COVE
SIT STILL SAID HALE QUIETLY THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A FIGHT SO LONG AS YOU ARE HERE THAR HAIN'T SAID ONE OF THE MEN WELL THEN HE LOOKED SHARPLY AT THE GIRL AND TURNED HIS HORSE COME ON BILL THAT'S OLE DAVE TOLLIVER'S GAL THE GIRL'S FACE WAS ON FIRE THEM MEAN FALINS
AND ONE OF THE BOYS RAN HIS EYES UP BOOT AND LEG AND IF THEY WERE LIFTED HIGHER HALE COULD NOT TELL WHAR'D YOU GIT HIM HE SQUEAKED THE GIRL TURNED HER HEAD AS THE MULE BROKE INTO A TROT AIN'T GOT TIME TO TELL THEY ARE MY COUSINS EXPLAINED THE GIRL
HOWDYE SAID HALE TAKING IN THE GROUP WITH HIS GLANCE BUT LEAVING HIS EYES ON YOUNG DAVE THE REST NODDED BUT THE BOY WAS TOO SURPRISED FOR SPEECH AND THE SPIRIT OF DEVILTRY TOOK THE GIRL WHEN SHE SAW HER BROTHER'S FACE AND AT THE GATE SHE TURNED MUCH OBLEEGED SHE SAID
ON THE MANTEL WERE TWO PISTOLS AND IN ONE CORNER WAS THE BIG WINCHESTER HE REMEMBERED AND BEHIND IT WAS THE BIG BRASS TELESCOPE ON THE TABLE WAS A BIBLE AND A VOLUME OF SWEDENBORG AND AMONG THE USUAL STRINGS OF PEPPER PODS AND BEANS AND TWISTED LONG GREEN TOBACCO
ALL DROPPED AND WITH THOSE TWO ALL PUT UP THEIR GUNS EACH MAN HOWEVER WATCHING NOW THE MAN WHO HAD JUST BEEN COVERING HIM IT IS NOT WISE FOR THE STRANGER TO SHOW TOO MUCH INTEREST IN THE PERSONAL AFFAIRS OF MOUNTAIN MEN
WITH MEMORIES OF THE FEUD WHICH HAD LONG EMBROILED THE WHOLE COUNTY NOT THAT EVERYBODY TOOK PART IN IT BUT ON THE MATTER EVERYBODY AS AN OLD WOMAN TOLD HIM HAD FEELIN'S IT HAD BEGUN SO HE LEARNED JUST AFTER THE WAR
YES SAID HALE IMPATIENTLY I'M GOING OVER TO LONESOME COVE CAN I STAY HERE ALL NIGHT SHORE SAID THE OLD MAN HOSPITABLY THAT'S A FINE HOSS YOU GOT THAR HE ADDED WITH A CHUCKLE BEEN SWAPPIN
WHAT'S THE CALIBRE BIGGEST MADE WAS THE ANSWER
WELL I WASN'T CROSSIN THAT CRICK JES EXACTLY FER FUN SAID THE GIRL DEMURELY AND THEN SHE MURMURED SOMETHING ABOUT HER COUSINS AND LOOKED BACK THEY HAD GONE DOWN TO A SHALLOWER FORD AND WHEN THEY TOO HAD WADED ACROSS THEY SAID NOTHING AND THE GIRL SAID NOTHING
NOW WHEN I GIVE THE WORD I WANT YOU JIM FALIN AND RUFE TOLLIVER THAR TO DRAP YER GUNS ALREADY RUFE WAS GRINNING LIKE A DEVIL OVER THE ABSURDITY OF THE SITUATION NOW SAID THE JUDGE AND THE TWO GUNS WERE DROPPED PUT EM IN YO POCKETS THEY DID DRAP
WHO DREAMED DREAMS AND HAD VISIONS AND SLIPPED THROUGH THE HILLS IN HIS MYSTERIOUS MOCCASINS ON ERRANDS OF MERCY OR CHASING MEN FROM VANITY PERSONAL ENMITY OR FOR FUN AND STILL APPEARED SO SANE HE WAS A TYPE THAT CONFOUNDED NO WONDER
OR A WOMAN WITH A BABY IN HER LAP AND TWO MORE CHILDREN BEHIND ALL DRESSED IN HOMESPUN OR STORE CLOTHES AND THE PAINT FROM ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS ON HER HAT STREAKING THE FACE OF EVERY GIRL WHO HAD UNWISELY SCANNED THE HEAVENS THAT MORNING
CENTRE FIRE RIM SAID THE RED FOX
NOW AND THEN AN OPEN FEUDSMAN WITH A WINCHESTER PASSED AND MANY A MAN WAS BELTED WITH CARTRIDGES FOR THE BIG PISTOL DANGLING AT HIS HIP WHEN COURT OPENED THE RAIN CEASED THE SUN CAME OUT AND HALE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD TO THE BATTERED TEMPLE OF JUSTICE
WHY DON'T SOMEBODY SHOOT HE ASKED SARCASTICALLY YOU'RE A PURTY SET O FOOLS AIN'T YOU
HE KNEW HOW FOOLISH IT WAS FOR THE STRANGER TO SHOW SYMPATHY WITH OR INTEREST IN ONE FACTION OR ANOTHER IN A MOUNTAIN FEUD BUT TO GIVE ANY KIND OF INFORMATION OF ONE TO THE OTHER THAT WAS UNWISE INDEED AHEAD OF THEM NOW A LITTLE STREAM RAN FROM A RAVINE ACROSS THE ROAD
HE'LL DO YOU MORE GOOD THAR THAN ANY WHAR ELSE HALE LAUGHED ALOUD THE JUDGE GLARED AT HIM AND HE TURNED QUICKLY UPSTAIRS TO HIS WORK IN THE DEED ROOM TILL NOON HE WORKED AND YET THERE WAS NO TROUBLE AFTER DINNER HE WENT BACK AND IN TWO HOURS HIS WORK WAS DONE
WERE DRYING HERBS AND ROOTS OF ALL KINDS AND ABOUT THE FIREPLACE WERE BOTTLES OF LIQUIDS THAT HAD BEEN STEWED FROM THEM THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN SERVED AND OPENED HER LIPS NOT AT ALL SUPPER WAS EATEN WITH NO FURTHER REFERENCE TO THE DOINGS IN TOWN THAT DAY
THE OLD BEAST STUMBLING OVER THE STONES WHEREAT THE GIRL UNAFRAID MADE SOUNDS OF MUCH MERRIMENT ACROSS HALE STOPPED AND SAID COURTEOUSLY IF YOU ARE GOING UP THIS WAY YOU ARE QUITE WELCOME TO RIDE ON
AND SHE CAUGHT HER BREATH SO SUDDENLY AND SO SHARPLY THAT HALE TURNED TO SEE WHAT THE MATTER WAS SHE SEARCHED HIS FACE WITH HER BLACK EYES WHICH WERE LIKE JUNE'S WITHOUT THE DEPTHS OF JUNE'S I WAS JUST A WONDERIN IF MEBBE YOU WASN'T THE SAME FELLER THAT WAS OVER IN LONESOME LAST FALL
OF THE REMAINS OF MAN ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMAINS OF THE GREAT EXTINCT SOUTH AMERICAN FAUNA OF THE MYLODON OF A GIANT UNGULATE OF A HUGE CAT LIKE THE LION AND OF AN EXTRAORDINARY ABERRANT HORSE
FOR IT IS NOT SAFE TO GENERALIZE OVERMUCH ABOUT ANY COUNTRY MERELY FROM A VISIT TO ITS CAPITAL OR ITS CHIEF SEAPORT THESE TRAVELLERS OF THE SECOND CATEGORY CAN GIVE US MOST INTERESTING AND VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT QUAINT LITTLE BELATED CITIES
AND IF POSSIBLE VIVID STYLE IS VITAL TO THE PRODUCTION OF THE BEST WORK IN EITHER SCIENCE OR HISTORY DARWIN AND HUXLEY ARE CLASSICS AND THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IF THEY HAD NOT WRITTEN GOOD ENGLISH THE THOUGHT IS ESSENTIAL
IF EXPRESSED IN A MEAN OR OBSCURE MANNER MISTER HASEMAN HAS SUCH EXCELLENT THOUGHT THAT IT IS A PITY TO MAKE IT A WORK OF IRRITATING LABOR TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT THE THOUGHT IS
HE ADDS A RARE POWER TO DRAW WITH BOTH CAUTION AND ORIGINALITY THE NECESSARY GENERAL CONCLUSIONS FROM THE RESULTS OF HIS OWN OBSERVATIONS AND FROM THE RECORDED STUDIES OF OTHER MEN
INSTEAD OF LEAVING VACANCIES WHICH MUST BE FILLED BY THE PUZZLED AND GROPING READER HIS OWN VIEWS AND HIS QUOTATIONS FROM THE VIEWS OF OTHERS ABOUT THE STATIC AND DYNAMIC THEORIES OF DISTRIBUTION ARE EXAMPLES OF AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE
SO IMPERFECTLY EXPRESSED AS TO MAKE US DOUBTFUL WHETHER IT IS PERFECTLY APPREHENDED BY THE WRITER HE CAN AVOID THE USE OF THOSE PEDANTIC TERMS WHICH ARE REALLY NOTHING BUT OFFENSIVE AND FORTUNATELY EPHEMERAL SCIENTIFIC SLANG
AND ALL THE OTHER CONTINENTS PRESENT AND PAST OF THE WORLD SINCE A PERIOD GEOLOGICALLY NOT VERY REMOTE THESE LAND BRIDGES MOREOVER MUST MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN LITERALLY BRIDGES
OF COURSE TRAVELLERS OF THIS KIND NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THEMSELVES DO NOT QUALIFY THEM TO SPEAK AS WILDERNESS EXPLORERS
AND BOTH MISCHIEVOUS UNLESS THIS SCIENTIST POSSESS A RARE AND ACCURATE HABIT OF THOUGHT JOINED TO INDUSTRY AND MASTERY OF DETAIL NAMELY THE GIFT OF CLEAR AND INTERESTING WRITING AND THE GIFT OF GENERALIZATION
BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT HE STUDIED AT FIRST HAND MANY OTHER MORE OR LESS KINDRED SUBJECTS AS MAY BE SEEN IN HIS REMARKS ON THE INDIANS AND IN HIS EXCELLENT PAMPHLET ON SOME FACTORS OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IN SOUTH AMERICA
AMEGHINO RENDERED MARKED SERVICES TO PALEONTOLOGY BUT HE GENERALIZED WITH COMPLETE RECKLESSNESS FROM THE SLENDEREST DATA AND EVEN THESE DATA HE OFTEN COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTOOD OR MISINTERPRETED
OR THE BARREN GROUNDS WEST OF HUDSON BAY A HUNDRED YEARS AGO EVEN SEVENTY OR EIGHTY YEARS AGO BEFORE THE AGE OF STEAMBOATS AND RAILROADS IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT THAN AT PRESENT TO DEFINE THE LIMITS BETWEEN THIS CLASS AND THE NEXT
LONG NARROW TONGUES OF LAND THRUST IN EVERY DIRECTION ACROSS THE BROAD OCEANS ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW THE CONTINENTAL LAND MASSES HAVE BEEN IN A FAIRLY FLUID CONDITION OF INSTABILITY
HIS FAVORITE THESIS INCLUDED THE ORIGIN OF MAMMALIAN LIFE AND OF MAN HIMSELF IN SOUTHERNMOST SOUTH AMERICA WITH AS INCIDENTS THE BELIEF THAT THE MAMMALIAN BEARING STRATA OF SOUTH AMERICA
MUST BE FURTHEST REMOVED FROM FINALITY THE ZOOLOGIST WHO WORKS TO MOST ADVANTAGE IN THE WILDERNESS MUST TAKE HIS TIME AND THEREFORE HE MUST NORMALLY FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF AND NOT ACCOMPANY THE FIRST EXPLORERS
ARE OTHER INSTANCES OF THE WORK THAT CAN THUS BE DONE BURTON'S WRITINGS ON THE INTERIOR OF BRAZIL OFFER AN EXCELLENT INSTANCE OF THE VALUE OF A SOJOURN OR TRIP OF THIS TYPE EVEN WITHOUT ANY ESPECIAL SCIENTIFIC OBJECT
WERE OF MUCH GREATER AGE THAN THE STRATA WITH CORRESPONDING REMAINS ELSEWHERE THAT IN SOUTH AMERICA VARIOUS SPECIES AND GENERA OF MEN EXISTED IN TERTIARY TIMES
AND NO BOOK SINCE WRITTEN HAS IN ANY WAY SUPPLANTED IT TRAVEL OF THE THIRD CATEGORY INCLUDES THE WORK OF THE TRUE WILDERNESS EXPLORERS WHO ADD TO OUR SUM OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE AND OF THE SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO FOLLOWING THEIR SEVERAL BENTS
THIS IS A TRIP WELL WORTH TAKING BY ALL INTELLIGENT MEN AND WOMEN WHO CAN AFFORD IT AND IT IS BEING TAKEN BY SUCH MEN AND WOMEN WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IT ENTAILS NO MORE DIFFICULTY THAN A SIMILAR TRIP TO THE MEDITERRANEAN
IT IS DESIRABLE THAT HERE AND THERE A PART OF THE WORK SHOULD BE DONE IN OUTLINE BY SUCH A GEOGRAPHIC AND ZOOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE AS OURS WE WOULD FOR EXAMPLE BE VERY GRATEFUL FOR SUCH WORK IN PORTIONS OF THE INTERIOR OF THE GUIANAS
OVER A LARGE EXTENT OF SOUTH AMERICAN TERRITORY HITHERTO ONLY PARTIALLY KNOWN OR QUITE UNEXPLORED HASEMAN'S PRIMARY OBJECT WAS TO STUDY THE CHARACTERISTICS AND DISTRIBUTION OF SOUTH AMERICAN FISHES
TRAVELS OF THIS KIND IN SOUTH AMERICA IN ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL MATTERS THE STUDIES AND OBSERVATIONS OF THESE TRAVELLERS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT AND SOMETIMES TO CORRECT THOSE OF TRAVELLERS OF THE FIRST CATEGORY
FOR BOOKS OF TRAVEL DARWIN'S VOYAGE OF THE BEAGLE IS TO ME THE BEST BOOK OF THE KIND EVER WRITTEN IT IS ONE OF THOSE CLASSICS WHICH DECLINE TO GO INTO ARTIFICIAL CATEGORIES AND WHICH STAND BY THEMSELVES
FIRST THERE ARE THE TRAVELLERS WHO SKIRT THE CONTINENT IN COMFORTABLE STEAMERS GOING FROM ONE GREAT SEAPORT TO ANOTHER AND OCCASIONALLY TAKING A SHORT RAILWAY JOURNEY TO SOME BIG INTERIOR CITY NOT TOO FAR FROM THE COAST
INSTEAD OF THE CHARACTERISTIC OR BODILY CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ANIMAL OR SPECIES AND OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLEX WHEN HE MEANS NOTHING WHATEVER BUT THE ENVIRONMENT
THE REASON THAT IT IS WORTH WHILE TO ENTER THIS PROTEST AGAINST MISTER HASEMAN'S STYLE IS BECAUSE HIS WORK IS OF SUCH REAL AND MARKED VALUE THE PAMPHLET ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF SOUTH AMERICAN SPECIES SHOWS THAT TO EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY AS A FIELD WORKER
AND THEY SAY THAT IF WE CONSIDER IT APART FROM THE SCRIPTURES THE OPINIONS OF THE AGES ARE SO MANY AND SO VARIED THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE ONE MORE THAN THE OTHER AND THAT FINALLY CONSIDERING THIS NOBILITY
BUT NOW SOMETHING HAPPENED PLEASE LET ME TELL IT MY OWN WAY A SHOUT FROM THE DRIVEWAY OR A BIT OF SNOW THROWN AGAINST THE WINDOW DREW HER ATTENTION TO A MAN STANDING BELOW
TURNING UPON ME WITH SOME SEVERITY HE DECLARED THERE ARE NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE CHANCES IN A THOUSAND THAT MY NEXT WORD TO YOU WILL BE TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR MISTER DURAND'S ARRAIGNMENT AND TRIAL BUT AN INFINITESIMAL CHANCE REMAINS TO THE CONTRARY
MUST BE MORE NOBLE THAN SCULPTURE THAT OF THE BLACKSMITH MUST SURPASS THE GOLDSMITH'S AND THAT OF MASONRY MUST BE SUPERIOR TO ARCHITECTURE THEY SAY NEXT THAT THE TRUE DIFFICULTIES LIE RATHER IN THE MIND THAN IN THE BODY
BUT I DID NOT QUAIL I ONLY SUBDUED MY MANNER AND SPOKE WITH QUIETER CONVICTION
CALL FOR MORE STUDY AND KNOWLEDGE ARE MORE NOBLE AND EXCELLENT THAN THOSE THAT AVAIL THEMSELVES RATHER OF STRENGTH OF BODY AND THEY DECLARE THAT SINCE THE PAINTERS RELY MORE ON THE WORTH OF THE MIND THAN THE OTHERS THIS HIGHEST HONOUR BELONGS TO PAINTING
NO ONLY THE ONE TIME IS SHE DISCREET VERY ON THIS SUBJECT SHE WILL BE LIKE THE GRAVE UNLESS FORCED BY YOU TO SPEAK AND MISS GREY SHE IS STILL ILL
USING ONLY HIS MIND AND HAND MOREOVER THEY LAY VERY GREAT STRESS ON THE FACT THAT THINGS ARE MORE NOBLE AND MORE PERFECT IN PROPORTION AS THEY APPROACH MORE NEARLY TO THE TRUTH
NOT TO MENTION THAT IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF ART THAT HAS TO BE PRACTISED DESIGN WHICH IS OUR DESIGN IS USED BY ALL SO THAT THE MEMBERS OF PAINTING ARE MORE NUMEROUS AND MORE USEFUL THAN THOSE OF SCULPTURE THEY DO NOT
TO SHOW THAT THE LATTER MIGHT HAVE COME INTO MISTER DURAND'S POSSESSION IN SOME OF THE MANY VISITS HE WAS SHOWN TO HAVE MADE OF LATE TO VARIOUS CURIO SHOPS IN AND OUT OF NEW YORK CITY
THE MOMENT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN HER PRESENCE NOT BECAUSE SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
THAT THEY HAVE MANY MORE THAN THE SCULPTORS BECAUSE PAINTING EMBRACES THE INVENTION OF HISTORY THE MOST DIFFICULT ART OF FORESHORTENING ALL THE BRANCHES OF ARCHITECTURE NEEDFUL FOR THE MAKING OF BUILDINGS PERSPECTIVE COLOURING IN DISTEMPER
IN CONTRAST WITH WHAT MAY BE BELIEVED NAY SEEN TO HAVE HAPPENED IN ANCIENT TIMES WHEN SCULPTURE ROSE TO ITS GREATEST HEIGHT INDEED IT IS MANIFEST THAT HE WHO CANNOT USE AND WASTE
A SMALL QUANTITY OF MARBLE AND HARD STONE WHICH ARE VERY COSTLY CANNOT HAVE THAT PRACTICE IN THE ART THAT IS ESSENTIAL HE WHO DOES NOT PRACTISE DOES NOT LEARN IT AND HE WHO DOES NOT LEARN IT CAN DO NO GOOD WHEREFORE
THEY SAY MOREOVER THAT WHEREAS SCULPTURE THROUGH THE STUBBORNNESS AND THE IMPERFECTION OF THE MATERIAL DOES NOT REPRESENT THE EMOTIONS OF THE SOUL SAVE WITH MOTION WHICH DOES NOT HOWEVER FIND MUCH SCOPE THEREIN
OR TO THE SMALL JUDGMENT OF THE SCULPTOR THIS NEVER HAPPENS TO PAINTERS FOR THE REASON THAT AT EVERY SLIP OF THE BRUSH
SUBORDINATE TO ITSELF THAN HAS PAINTING SUCH AS LOW RELIEF WORKING IN CLAY WAX PLASTER WOOD AND IVORY CASTING IN METALS
IT SEEMS THAT WHEN THE FIRST NEWS CAME OF THE GREAT CRIME WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN NEW YORK MISTER FAIRBROTHER WAS ABSENT FROM THE HOTEL ON A PROSPECTING TOUR THROUGH THE ADJACENT MOUNTAINS
I DID NOT SEE WHERE HE CARRIED THEM I ONLY SAW HIS FACE TURNED TOWARD THE ALCOVE
SAYING THAT SCULPTURE CALLS FOR A CERTAIN BETTER DISPOSITION BOTH OF MIND AND OF BODY THAT ARE RARELY FOUND TOGETHER WHEREAS PAINTING CONTENTS ITSELF WITH ANY FEEBLE TEMPERAMENT SO LONG AS IT HAS A HAND IF NOT BOLD AT LEAST SURE
I FELT MY SPIRIT HARDEN AND MY PURPOSE STRENGTHEN TILL I HARDLY KNEW MYSELF I MUST HAVE FRIGHTENED MY UNCLE FOR HIS HAND WAS ALWAYS ON MY ARM AND HIS CHIDING VOICE IN MY EAR BIDDING ME BEWARE
HAS NOT ONLY DIMINISHED BY A GREAT AMOUNT THEIR OWN WORKS AND THE HONOURABLE TESTIMONIES OF OTHERS BUT HAS ALSO BLOTTED OUT AND DESTROYED THE NAMES OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN KEPT ALIVE BY ANY OTHER MEANS THAN BY THE RIGHT VIVACIOUS
AS THE OTHERS SAY AND NOT TO BE REMEDIED SAVE BY PATCHES WHICH EVEN AS IN GARMENTS THEY ARE SIGNS OF POVERTY OF WARDROBE SO TOO BOTH IN SCULPTURE AND IN PICTURES ARE SIGNS OF POVERTY OF INTELLECT AND JUDGMENT
SAY IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IF THE SCULPTORS WISH TO DISCUSS THE MATTER ON THE GROUND OF THE SCRIPTURES THE CHIEF NOBILITY IS THEIR OWN AND THAT THE SCULPTORS DECEIVE THEMSELVES VERY GRIEVOUSLY
AND MAKES USE OF TOUCH AND SIGHT THE PAINTERS IN TWO DISTINCT ACTIONS GIVE RELIEF AND DEPTH TO A FLAT SURFACE WITH THE HELP OF ONE SINGLE SENSE AND THIS WHEN IT HAS BEEN DONE BY A PERSON INTELLIGENT IN THE ART
HIS CONDITION WAS SUCH THAT NEITHER THE COURIER NOR SUCH OTHERS AS SAW HIM HAD THE HEART TO TELL HIM THE DREADFUL NEWS FROM NEW YORK OR EVEN TO SHOW HIM THE PAPERS TO THEIR GREAT RELIEF HE BETRAYED NO CURIOSITY IN THEM
AND HIS TONE ALTOGETHER GENTLE AS IN REPLY TO MY EXCUSES FOR TROUBLING HIM WITH MY OPINIONS HE TOLD ME THAT IN A CASE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE
FROM THE AIDS THAT IT REQUIRES FOR ITS COMPLETION AND FROM THE TIME THAT IS TAKEN IN WORKING IT RATHER THAN FROM THE EXCELLENCE OF THE ART ITSELF AND ALTHOUGH THAT DOES NOT SUFFICE AND NO GREATER PRICE IS FOUND
WHICH HAD ALREADY FIGURED IN THE INQUEST AS THE MYSTERIOUS COMMUNICATION TAKEN FROM MISSUS FAIRBROTHER'S HAND BY THE CORONER

HIS TONES STRANGELY QUIET YES SENOR I HAVE THE PAPERS TO PROVE IT DO YOU ADMIT IT HE DEMANDED OF WALCOTT WITH A GLANCE WHICH MADE THE LATTER QUAIL WHILE HIS HAND SOUGHT ONE OF THE LOADED REVOLVERS LYING ON THE TABLE
AND PROVOKES A GREAT DEAL OF INNOCENT MIRTH YOU DON'T YOURSELF BELIEVE THAT LAST YARN ABOUT THE PROHIBITION CANDIDATE DO YOU I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY YARN ABOUT HIM SAID THE BIBLIOMANIAC THAT HE IS THE OWNER OF A BREWERY UP IN ROCHESTER
OR AT LEAST THAT THE STORY IS GREATLY EXAGGERATED HE MAY HAVE STUCK A PIN INTO THE COOK AND PLAYED SOME BOYISH TRICK UPON SOME OF HIS RELATIVES BUT THE STORY ON THE FACE OF IT IS UNTRUE AND THEREFORE HARMLESS
WHO SPENT HIS LIFE LOOKING FOR AN HONEST MAN WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT EVERY FOUR YEARS THAT HE COULD SPOT HIM INSTANTLY BY MERELY COMING TO THIS COUNTRY AND TAKING HIS CHOICE FROM AMONG THE SEVERAL CANDIDATES
CAN HAVE NO PRIVATE LIFE THEN YOU APPROVE OF THESE STORIES OF CANDIDATES COUSINS THE PRATTLING ANECDOTES OF THEIR GRANDCHILDREN THESE PARAGRAPHS NARRATING THE DOINGS OF THEIR UNCLES IN LAW AND ALL THAT SNEERED THE BIBLIOMANIAC
NOTHING SAID THE OTHER SHE IS SIMPLY RUINING HERSELF SAID OLIVER I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET REGGIE MANN TO HAVE HER INTRODUCED TO MISSUS DEVON BUT HE SAYS HE WOULDN'T DARE TO TAKE THE RISK NO I PRESUME NOT SAID MONTAGUE
A SINGLE SCRATCH MEANS DEATH AT SIGHT OF HER WALCOTT'S FACE GREW LIVID YOU FIEND YOU SHE DEVIL HE HISSED THIS IS YOUR DOING IS IT AND HE BURST INTO A TORRENT OF CURSES AND IMPRECATIONS
MISTER UNDERWOOD WENT BRIEFLY OVER THE TERMS WHICH HE HAD OUTLINED ON A SHEET OF PAPER BEFORE HIM ON HIS DESK WALCOTT SEATED EIGHT OR TEN FEET DISTANT LISTENED HIS DARK FACE PALING WITH ANGER
UNIMAGINATIVE PEOPLE AND THAT WOULD BE DEATH TO PROGRESS NO PEOPLE CAN PROGRESS THAT LACKS IMAGINATION POLITICS IS AN EMERY WHEEL THAT KEEPS OUR WITS POLISHED WELL
THEY HAD WAITED BUT A FEW MOMENTS WHEN MISTER UNDERWOOD'S CARRIAGE STOPPED BEFORE THIS ENTRANCE AND AN INSTANT LATER KATE HEARD HER FATHER'S VOICE DIRECTING THE COACHMAN TO CALL FOR HIM IN ABOUT AN HOUR AS THE KEY TURNED IN THE LOCK SHE HEARD WALCOTT'S VOICE ALSO
MISTER GAMBLE COMES FROM PITTSBURG INTERPOSED OLIVER INDEED SAID MONTAGUE STRIVING TO MAKE CONVERSATION ARE YOU IN BUSINESS THERE NO I AM OUT OF BUSINESS SAID MISTER GAMBLE WITH A SMILE
AS SHE EXTENDED HER HAND SHE TAUNTINGLY HELD HER WRIST CLOSE TO THE TINY POINT SCARCELY LARGER THAN A GOOD SIZED PIN LIFE AND FREEDOM ARE PRECIOUS SENOR SHE SAID IN LOW MOCKING TONES
THE STEEL MAN YOU MEAN ASKED MONTAGUE NO I NEVER MET HIM WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HIM SAID THE OTHER POOR CHAP IT REALLY WAS HARD LUCK YOU KNOW IT WASN'T HIS FAULT DID YOU EVER HEAR THE TRUE STORY NO SAID MONTAGUE
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING THE TRUST AND LAST YEAR THEY BOUGHT ME OUT AND NOW I'M SEEING THE WORLD MISTER GAMBLE RELAPSED INTO THOUGHT AGAIN I NEVER WENT IN FOR THAT SORT OF THING MYSELF HE SAID MEDITATIVELY I AM A MARRIED MAN I AM
YOU'VE NOTICED THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS I SUPPOSE I HAVE NOTICED THEM SAID MONTAGUE HE IS ADDING SOMETHING OVER A MILLION A MONTH I HEAR IT SOUNDS VERY ATTRACTIVE SAID THE OTHER AND ADDED DRILY
THEN YOU CANNOT COMPLAIN IF UNCLE SAM IS EQUALLY SOLICITOUS ABOUT THE PERSONAL PARAPHERNALIA OF THE MAN WHO ASKS TO OCCUPY HIS LITTLE COTTAGE ON THE POTOMAC SAID THE IDIOT
YOU ARE WARM AS THE CHILDREN SAY LAUGHED HIS BROTHER MONTAGUE STARED AT HIM OLIVER YOU DON'T MEAN IT HE SAID THAT FELLOW IN SOCIETY
BY THE WAY OLIVER REMARKED AFTER A MOMENT THE PRENTICES HAVE ASKED ALICE UP TO NEWPORT ALICE SEEMS TO BE QUITE TAKEN WITH THAT YOUNG CHAP CURTISS HE COMES AROUND A GOOD DEAL SAID MONTAGUE HE SEEMS A VERY DECENT FELLOW
ONCE CALMED MISTER UNDERWOOD NOTWITHSTANDING MISTER BRITTON'S PROTESTATIONS SULLENLY REFUSED TO PROSECUTE WALCOTT TELEPHONING FOR AN ATTORNEY WHO WAS AN OLD TIME AND TRUSTED FRIEND
AND SHE SAVED ME FROM WORSE THAN DEATH IN PREVENTING THE CARRYING OUT OF THE FARCE OF AN ILLEGAL MARRIAGE WITH THAT VILLAIN BY GIVING ME A GLIMPSE OF HIS REAL CHARACTER BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE
CERTAINLY I DO SAID THE IDIOT WHEN I HEAR THAT JUDGE TORKIN'S GRANDSON AGED FOUR HAS COME OUT FOR HIS GRANDFATHER'S OPPONENT I AM DELIGHTED AND GIVE THE JUDGE CREDIT FOR THE INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHICH HEREDITY ACCOUNTS FOR
THE CHIEF TROUBLE WITH HIM IS THAT HE GETS CONFIDENTIAL MONTAGUE RELAPSED INTO SILENCE AND OLIVER CHANGED THE SUBJECT IT SEEMS TOO BAD ABOUT LUCY HE SAID IS THERE NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT
IT BEGAN IN PARIS SOME NEWSPAPER WOMAN TRIED TO BLACKMAIL HIM AND HE HAD HER PUT IN JAIL FOR THREE MONTHS AND WHEN SHE GOT OUT AGAIN THEN THE PAPERS AT HOME BEGAN TO GET STORIES ABOUT POOR INGHAM'S CUTTING UP
AND THE PRINCIPAL WITNESS AGAINST THAT MAN HIS OWN WIFE DO YOU SUPPOSE FOR A MOMENT I'LL HAVE MY DAUGHTER'S NAME DRAGGED THROUGH SUCH MIRE NO BY GOD I'LL BLOW THE DOG'S BRAINS OUT WITH MY OWN HAND FIRST
HE HAD AN AGREEMENT DRAWN AND SIGNED WHEREBY UPON THE REPAYMENT OF THE FUNDS BELONGING TO HIM AFTER DEDUCTING AN AMOUNT THEREFROM SUFFICIENT TO REPLACE WHAT HE HAD MISAPPROPRIATED HE WAS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY ALTOGETHER
THEY'VE GOT A NEW SCANDAL ON THEIR HANDS NOW SAID OLIVER THEY'RE A LIVELY CROWD THE STEEL FELLOWS LAUGHED THE OTHER THEY WANT TO MAKE DAVIDSON RESIGN TOO BUT HE'LL FIGHT THEM HE KNOWS TOO MUCH YOU SHOULD HEAR HIS STORY
OVERTOOK EFFIE FLYING DOWN ONE OF THE LONG ALLEYS AT THE HEAD OF HER PACK BEYOND HER HE SAW MISS VINER SEATED NEAR THE STONE RIMMED BASIN BESIDE WHICH HE AND ANNA HAD PAUSED ON THEIR FIRST WALK TO THE RIVER THE GIRL COMING FORWARD AT HIS APPROACH
HE HAD STAKED SOMETHING MORE ON IT AND HAD SOMEHOW IN THE SEQUEL HAD A MORE PALPABLE LOSS TO SHOW BUT THE PLAIN FACT WAS THAT HE HADN'T SPENT A PENNY ON IT WHICH WAS NO DOUBT THE REASON OF THE PRODIGIOUS SCORE IT HAD SINCE BEEN ROLLING UP
AND HIS STEP MOTHER'S CONCERN POSSIBLY ANNA HAD FOUND REASON TO CHANGE HER OWN ATTITUDE IN THE MATTER AND HAD MADE THE CHANGE KNOWN TO OWEN BUT THIS AGAIN WAS NEGATIVED BY THE FACT THAT DURING THE AFTERNOON'S SHOOTING
TAKE CARE SYLVIE ANXIOUSLY EXCLAIMED AS HE BEGAN RATHER CLUMSILY TO POINT IT YOU'LL CUT YOUR FINGER OFF IF YOU HOLD THE KNIFE SO IF OO CUTS IT OFF WILL OO GIVE IT TO ME PLEASE BRUNO THOUGHTFULLY ADDED
WHY NOT TRY THE LARGE ONE I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT A DOOR UNLOCKS MUCH MORE NICELY WITH ITS OWN KEY THE VERY FIRST TRIAL OF THE LARGE KEY PROVED A SUCCESS THE GARDENER OPENED THE DOOR AND HELD OUT HIS HAND FOR THE MONEY
AND SYLVIE SETS ME SOME LESSONS THEN IT'S ALL RIGHT I'M SORRY YOU DON'T LIKE LESSONS I SAID YOU SHOULD COPY SYLVIE SHE'S ALWAYS AS BUSY AS THE DAY IS LONG
BUT AS HIS EYE FELL ON MISS VINER HIS EXPRESSION ALTERED AS SUDDENLY AS HERS THE CHANGE FOR DARROW WAS LESS DEFINABLE BUT PERHAPS FOR THAT REASON IT STRUCK HIM AS MORE SHARPLY SIGNIFICANT
IN FACT IT CAN ONLY BE SHE WENT ON WITH ONE OF HER DISCONCERTING FLASHES OF ASTUTENESS FOR ONE OF TWO REASONS EITHER BECAUSE YOU FEEL YOU OUGHT TO HELP ME OR BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON YOU THINK YOU OWE IT TO MISSUS LEATH TO LET HER KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW OF ME
IN MAKING THINGS INTO HEAPS WHICH NO DOUBT YOU OFTEN DO
THE LOOK WAS SO FUGITIVE THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID WHEREIN IT DIFFERED FROM HER NORMAL PROFESSIONAL AIR OF HAVING HER PUPIL ON HER MIND EFFIE SPRANG PAST THEM AND DARROW TOOK UP THE GIRL'S CHALLENGE
AT ANY RATE BEAT ABOUT THE CASE AS HE WOULD IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE OWED IT TO ANNA AND INCIDENTALLY TO HIS OWN PEACE OF MIND TO FIND SOME WAY OF SECURING SOPHY VINER'S FUTURE
I HOPE AT ANY RATE YOU'LL LISTEN TO MY REASONS THERE'S BEEN TIME ON BOTH SIDES TO THINK THEM OVER SINCE HE CAUGHT HIMSELF BACK AND HUNG HELPLESS ON THE SINCE
AND SUCH HORRID MEALS WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR DINNER TO DAY SAID THE PROFESSOR A LITTLE PIECE OF A DEAD CROW WAS BRUNO'S MOURNFUL REPLY HE MEANS ROOK PIE SYLVIE EXPLAINED
THE MUFFLED SUNLIGHT GLEAMED LIKE GOLD TISSUE THROUGH GREY GAUZE AND THE BEECH ALLEYS TAPERED AWAY TO A BLUE HAZE BLENT OF SKY AND FOREST
I SHOULD HAVE SHOOKED HIM OUT IF HE'D BEEN IN THERE HAS HE EVER BEEN LOST BEFORE SYLVIE ENQUIRED TURNING UP A CORNER OF THE HEARTH RUG AND PEEPING UNDER IT ONCE BEFORE SAID THE PROFESSOR HE ONCE LOST HIMSELF IN A WOOD AND COULDN'T HE FIND HIS SELF AGAIN SAID BRUNO
HE ARE TOO FAT WE HAD NO SORT OF DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE GARDENER THOUGH HE WAS HIDDEN FROM US BY SOME TREES THAT HARSH VOICE OF HIS SERVED TO DIRECT US AND AS WE DREW NEARER
WE WILL TRY A LESS EXCITING TOPIC THE PROFESSOR MILDLY REMARKED TO THE CHILDREN YOU WERE ASKING WE ASKED HIM TO LET US THROUGH THE GARDEN DOOR SAID SYLVIE BUT HE WOULDN'T BUT PERHAPS HE WOULD FOR YOU
FOR THE SAME SPACE OF TIME THE PAST SURGED UP IN HIM CONFUSEDLY THEN A VEIL DROPPED BETWEEN THEM HERE'S EFFIE NOW SHE EXCLAIMED HE TURNED AND SAW THE LITTLE GIRL TROTTING BACK TO THEM HER HAND IN OWEN LEATH'S
SEE SAID THE PROFESSOR POINTING OUT A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BULL'S EYE HIS IMPERIAL FATNESS HAD ONLY ONE SHOT AT IT AND HE WENT IN JUST HERE BRUNO CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE HOLE COULDN'T GO IN THERE HE WHISPERED TO ME
FOR A MOMENT IT OCCURRED TO DARROW THAT ANNA MIGHT HAVE EMPLOYED HER AFTERNOON IN PREPARING MADAME DE CHANTELLE FOR HER GRANDSON'S IMPENDING ANNOUNCEMENT BUT A GLANCE AT THE ELDER LADY'S UNCLOUDED BROW SHOWED THAT HE MUST SEEK ELSEWHERE THE CLUE TO OWEN'S TACITURNITY
BUT AS HE LOCKED THE DOOR BEHIND US WE HEARD HIM SINGING THOUGHTFULLY TO HIMSELF HE THOUGHT HE SAW A GARDEN DOOR THAT OPENED WITH A KEY HE LOOKED AGAIN AND FOUND IT WAS A DOUBLE RULE OF THREE
AND WHO HAD BEEN DESCRIBED TO HIM AS SUBJECT TO SUDDEN CHANGES OF HUMOUR AS TO ANNA'S FANCIED PERTURBATION IT MIGHT SIMPLY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT SHE HAD DECIDED TO PLEAD OWEN'S CAUSE THE NEXT DAY AND HAD PERHAPS ALREADY HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES AWAITING HER
THE CHANCE OF ANOTHER AND CALMER TALK AND HE RESOLVED TO SEEK IT AT THE EARLIEST HOUR HE HAD GATHERED THAT EFFIE'S LESSONS WERE PRECEDED BY AN EARLY SCAMPER IN THE PARK
IF HE SUSPECTED THAT THE CONVERSATION WAS NOT THE RESULT OF AN ACCIDENTAL ENCOUNTER MIGHT WONDER AT HIS STEP MOTHER'S SUITOR BEING ENGAGED AT SUCH AN HOUR IN PRIVATE TALK WITH HER LITTLE GIRL'S GOVERNESS
IF I WAS AS WISE AS THAT I SHOULD HAVE A HEAD ACHE ALL DAY LONG I KNOW I SHOULD YOU APPEAR TO BE TALKING TO SOMEBODY THAT ISN'T HERE THE PROFESSOR SAID TURNING ROUND TO THE CHILDREN WHO IS IT BRUNO LOOKED PUZZLED
BRUNO SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND BEGAN CRYING HE IS SO CRUEL HE SOBBED
WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU'LL ONLY LET ME SHE RAISED A HAND AS THOUGH TO CHECK HIM IT'S EXTREMELY FRIENDLY OF YOU I DO BELIEVE YOU MEAN IT AS A FRIEND BUT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY FINDING ME AS YOU SAY
AND HE BEGAN TROTTING ROUND AND ROUND THE ROOM LIFTING UP THE CHAIRS AND SHAKING THEM BRUNO TOOK A VERY SMALL BOOK OUT OF THE BOOKCASE OPENED IT AND SHOOK IT IN IMITATION OF THE PROFESSOR HE ISN'T HERE HE SAID
SHE LAID THE CASE BEFORE HIM WITH A COLD LUCIDITY I SHOULD IN YOUR PLACE I BELIEVE SHE ENDED WITH A LITTLE LAUGH I SHOULDN'T FEEL JUSTIFIED IN TELLING HER BEHIND YOUR BACK IF I THOUGHT YOU UNSUITED FOR THE PLACE
IN A HIGHER MANNER THE POET COMMUNICATES THE SAME PLEASURE
A SMALL ALTERATION IN OUR LOCAL POSITION APPRIZES US OF A DUALISM WE ARE STRANGELY AFFECTED BY SEEING THE SHORE FROM A MOVING SHIP FROM A BALLOON OR THROUGH THE TINTS OF AN UNUSUAL SKY
WHAT NEW THOUGHTS ARE SUGGESTED BY SEEING A FACE OF COUNTRY QUITE FAMILIAR IN THE RAPID MOVEMENT OF THE RAIL ROAD CAR NAY THE MOST WONTED OBJECTS MAKE A VERY SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE POINT OF VISION PLEASE US MOST
THE RELATIONS OF PARTS AND THE END OF THE WHOLE REMAINING THE SAME WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE WHETHER LAND AND SEA INTERACT AND WORLDS REVOLVE AND INTERMINGLE WITHOUT NUMBER OR END DEEP YAWNING UNDER DEEP
HOUSE AND TRADE IN MY UTTER IMPOTENCE TO TEST THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE REPORT OF MY SENSES TO KNOW WHETHER THE IMPRESSIONS THEY MAKE ON ME CORRESPOND WITH OUTLYING OBJECTS WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE
TO THIS ONE END OF DISCIPLINE ALL PARTS OF NATURE CONSPIRE A NOBLE DOUBT PERPETUALLY SUGGESTS ITSELF WHETHER THIS END BE NOT THE FINAL CAUSE OF THE UNIVERSE AND WHETHER NATURE OUTWARDLY EXISTS
WHILST WE BEHOLD UNVEILED THE NATURE OF JUSTICE AND TRUTH WE LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ABSOLUTE AND THE CONDITIONAL OR RELATIVE WE APPREHEND THE ABSOLUTE AS IT WERE FOR THE FIRST TIME
WE EXIST WE BECOME IMMORTAL FOR WE LEARN THAT TIME AND SPACE ARE RELATIONS OF MATTER THAT WITH A PERCEPTION OF TRUTH OR A VIRTUOUS WILL THEY HAVE NO AFFINITY
THERE IS SOMETHING UNGRATEFUL IN EXPANDING TOO CURIOUSLY THE PARTICULARS OF THE GENERAL PROPOSITION THAT ALL CULTURE TENDS TO IMBUE US WITH IDEALISM I HAVE NO HOSTILITY TO NATURE BUT A CHILD'S LOVE TO IT
ENABLES THE POET THUS TO MAKE FREE WITH THE MOST IMPOSING FORMS AND PHENOMENA OF THE WORLD AND TO ASSERT THE PREDOMINANCE OF THE SOUL THREE
THE SUN THE MOUNTAIN THE CAMP THE CITY THE HERO THE MAIDEN NOT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE KNOW THEM BUT ONLY LIFTED FROM THE GROUND AND AFLOAT BEFORE THE EYE HE UNFIXES THE LAND AND THE SEA
MAN AND NATURE ARE INDISSOLUBLY JOINED THINGS ARE ULTIMATES AND THEY NEVER LOOK BEYOND THEIR SPHERE THE PRESENCE OF REASON MARS THIS FAITH
THAT THIS FEEBLE HUMAN BEING HAS PENETRATED THE VAST MASSES OF NATURE WITH AN INFORMING SOUL AND RECOGNISED ITSELF IN THEIR HARMONY THAT IS SEIZED THEIR LAW
PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL SCIENCE AND RELIGION ALL TEND TO AFFECT OUR CONVICTIONS OF THE REALITY OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD BUT I OWN
THE LOUNGER THE BEGGAR THE BOYS THE DOGS ARE UNREALIZED AT ONCE OR AT LEAST WHOLLY DETACHED FROM ALL RELATION TO THE OBSERVER AND SEEN AS APPARENT NOT SUBSTANTIAL BEINGS
THE WILD BEAUTY OF THIS HYPERBOLE I MAY SAY IN PASSING IT WOULD NOT BE EASY TO MATCH IN LITERATURE THIS TRANSFIGURATION WHICH ALL MATERIAL OBJECTS UNDERGO THROUGH THE PASSION OF THE POET
ANY TIME THESE TWENTY YEARS IN THESE CASES BY MECHANICAL MEANS IS SUGGESTED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OBSERVER AND THE SPECTACLE BETWEEN MAN AND NATURE HENCE ARISES A PLEASURE MIXED WITH AWE
THIS WILL BE FOUND CONTRARY TO ALL EXPERIENCE YET IS TRUE HAD ALREADY TRANSFERRED NATURE INTO THE MIND AND LEFT MATTER LIKE AN OUTCAST CORPSE FOUR
AT THE UNION OR OPPOSITION OF OTHER PERSONS NO MAN IS ITS ENEMY IT ACCEPTS WHATSOEVER BEFALLS AS PART OF ITS LESSON
WHICH IT USES TO CALL VISIONARY CHILDREN IT IS TRUE BELIEVE IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD THE BELIEF THAT IT APPEARS ONLY IS AN AFTERTHOUGHT BUT WITH CULTURE
I ONLY WISH TO INDICATE THE TRUE POSITION OF NATURE IN REGARD TO MAN WHEREIN TO ESTABLISH MAN ALL RIGHT EDUCATION TENDS AS THE GROUND WHICH TO ATTAIN IS THE OBJECT OF HUMAN LIFE THAT IS
TO ESTEEM NATURE AS AN ACCIDENT AND AN EFFECT TO THE SENSES AND THE UNRENEWED UNDERSTANDING BELONGS A SORT OF INSTINCTIVE BELIEF IN THE ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE OF NATURE IN THEIR VIEW
SAID OF EXTERNAL BEAUTY IT IS THE FRAIL AND WEARY WEED IN WHICH GOD DRESSES THE SOUL WHICH HE HAS CALLED INTO TIME IT APPEARS THAT MOTION POETRY
AND USES IT TO EMBODY ANY CAPRICE OF THOUGHT THAT IS UPPER MOST IN HIS MIND THE REMOTEST SPACES OF NATURE ARE VISITED AND THE FARTHEST SUNDERED THINGS ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER
BUT LIKE A HOUSE TO STAND IT IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS STRUCTURE THAT SO LONG AS THE ACTIVE POWERS PREDOMINATE OVER THE REFLECTIVE
THE BEST MOMENTS OF LIFE ARE THESE DELICIOUS AWAKENINGS OF THE HIGHER POWERS AND THE REVERENTIAL WITHDRAWING OF NATURE BEFORE ITS GOD LET US PROCEED TO INDICATE THE EFFECTS OF CULTURE ONE
OF MAN'S CONNECTION WITH NATURE CULTURE INVERTS THE VULGAR VIEWS OF NATURE AND BRINGS THE MIND TO CALL THAT APPARENT WHICH IT USES TO CALL REAL AND THAT REAL
LIFE IS NO LONGER IRKSOME AND WE THINK IT WILL NEVER BE SO NO MAN FEARS AGE OR MISFORTUNE OR DEATH IN THEIR SERENE COMPANY FOR HE IS TRANSPORTED OUT OF THE DISTRICT OF CHANGE
AS WILL APPEAR BY WHAT WE SHALL SAY IN TREATING OF THE TRANSPARENCY AND OPACITY OF BODIES FOR THE SURFACE CONSISTING THUS OF PARTICLES PUT TOGETHER AND THE ETHEREAL PARTICLES BEING ABOVE AND SMALLER
THEY EVEN THINK THAT THEY ARE RESPECTABLE PERSONS
THAT EACH SMALL PIECE OF THIS WAVE HC HAVING ARRIVED AT THE PLANE A B AND THERE GENERATING EACH ONE ITS PARTICULAR WAVE THESE WILL ALL HAVE WHEN C ARRIVES AT B
AND THIS WAS ITS THIRD AND GREATEST DAY WE LEFT ON MILD TEMPERED HORSES QUITE UNLIKE THE FIERCE FELLOWS OF YAMAGATA KEN
SHE DEMANDED YES SENORA TWO BETTER THAN YOURS BUT THE FACT IS THAT I WAS ADMIRING YOUR FRIZZES RETORTED THE RATHER UNGALLANT SOLDIER AS HE MOVED AWAY FROM HER
AND IF ONE WISHES TO SEE HOW THE WAVE AC HAS COME SUCCESSIVELY TO B N
FOR THE TRIANGLES ACB B N A BEING RECTANGULAR AND HAVING THE SIDE A B COMMON

AHAA AHA
MONKEY THEATRES AND DOG THEATRES TWO MANGY SHEEP AND A LEAN PIG ATTRACTING WONDERING CROWDS FOR NEITHER OF THESE ANIMALS IS KNOWN IN THIS REGION OF JAPAN
ACCORDING TO CLERICAL OPINION IN THE PHILIPPINES THE HIGHEST SECULAR OFFICIAL IS INFERIOR TO A FRIAR COOK CEDANT ARMA TOGAE SAID CICERO IN THE SENATE
WHO WAS EDUCATED IN THE COLLEGE OF OUR SISTERHOOD HE'S RICH AND WON'T CARE TO MAKE ENEMIES AND TO RUN THE RISK OF RUINING HIS FORTUNE AND HIS HAPPINESS THE SICK MAN NODDED IN AGREEMENT YES I THINK AS YOU DO
AN OLDER FRIEND OF THE FAMILY CONFESSOR OF THE DECEASED LADY AGE DIGNITY AND AUTHORITY
DOWN THE PINE AVENUE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ON HORSEBACK AND ON FOOT WERE TROOPING INTO MINATO FROM ALL THE FARMING VILLAGES GLAD IN THE GLORIOUS SUNSHINE WHICH SUCCEEDED FOUR DAYS OF RAIN THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF HORSES
WAS THE YOUNG DOMINICAN'S GREETING AS HE ENTERED SEATED IN A LARGE ARMCHAIR WAS AN AGED PRIEST WASTED AND RATHER SALLOW LIKE THE SAINTS THAT RIVERA PAINTED
REPLIED FRAY DAMASO SOURLY WITHOUT TAKING HIS HAND FROM THE BACK OF THE CHAIR SINCE YOU COMMAND IT I OBEY CONCLUDED FRAY SIBYLA DISPOSING HIMSELF TO TAKE THE SEAT I DON'T COMMAND IT
VANS AND KURUMAS POLICEMEN AND HORSEMEN ALL ON THEIR WAY TO A MEAN LOOKING TOWN MINATO THE JUNK PORT OF KUBOTA WHICH WAS KEEPING MATSURI OR FESTIVAL IN HONOUR OF THE BIRTHDAY OF THE GOD SHIMMAI
MEANWHILE THE FRANCISCAN HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF DO YOU SEE HE SAID TO THE RUBICUND YOUTH AT THE SAME TIME FLOURISHING HIS DESSERT SPOON
IMAGINING TO MYSELF THAT THE PLANE IN WHICH THIS FIGURE IS CUTS THE SPHERE OF THE WAVE THROUGH ITS CENTRE AND INTERSECTS THE PLANE A B AT RIGHT ANGLES
AS IF FROM INSTINCT THE TWO FRIARS BOTH STARTED TOWARD THE HEAD OF THE TABLE PERHAPS FROM HABIT
GET IN MARIA OR WE'LL BE LATE WHETHER OR NOT PADRE DAMASO WAS PREPARING A SERMON WE CANNOT SAY BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT SOME GRAVE MATTER FILLED HIS MIND FOR HE DID NOT EXTEND HIS HAND TO CAPITAN TIAGO
IF NOT SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR HIM TO DECLARE HIMSELF AN ENEMY OF OURS
I SAY THEN THAT THE WAVE AC BEING REGARDED ONLY AS A LINE PRODUCES NO LIGHT FOR A VISIBLE RAY OF LIGHT HOWEVER NARROW IT MAY BE HAS ALWAYS SOME WIDTH
AND TWO SPECIAL PEAKS OF UNEQUAL HEIGHT AT THE TOP THE WHOLE BEING NEARLY FIFTY FEET FROM THE GROUND ALL THESE PROJECTIONS WERE COVERED WITH BLACK COTTON CLOTH FROM WHICH BRANCHES OF PINES PROTRUDED
HE WAS ABOUT TO SAY THE DINNER IS NEARLY OVER AND HIS REVERENCE IS NOW SATIATED BUT RESTRAINED HIMSELF AND MERELY REMARKED TO THE OTHERS GENTLEMEN DON'T BE SURPRISED AT THE FAMILIARITY WITH WHICH OUR FORMER CURATE TREATS ME
IT IS EVIDENT THAT ONE COULD NOT DEMONSTRATE THE EQUALITY OF THE ANGLES OF INCIDENCE AND REFLEXION BY SIMILITUDE TO THAT WHICH HAPPENS TO A BALL THROWN AGAINST A WALL OF WHICH WRITERS HAVE ALWAYS MADE USE
WHENCE IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT THOUGH THE MOVEMENT OF THE ETHEREAL MATTER MIGHT COMMUNICATE ITSELF PARTLY TO THAT OF THE REFLECTING BODY THIS COULD IN NOTHING ALTER THE VELOCITY OF PROGRESSION OF THE WAVES
BUT ANYTHING MORE RUDE AND BARBAROUS COULD SCARCELY BE SEEN ON THE FRONTS OF EACH CAR UNDER A CANOPY WERE THIRTY PERFORMERS ON THIRTY DIABOLICAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH RENT THE AIR WITH A TRULY INFERNAL DISCORD
AND AN ARRANGEMENT OF BLUE COTTON FITFULLY AGITATED BY A PAIR OF BELLOWS BELOW REPRESENTED THE SEA
BESIDES I'VE LEARNED THAT THE PROVINCIAL HAS SCOFFED AT MY ORDERS I ASKED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THIS FRIAR AS A PUNISHMENT AND THEY TRANSFERRED HIM TO A BETTER TOWN MONKISH TRICKS AS WE SAY IN SPAIN
WHICH TURNED INTO A TREMENDOUS TORRENT WHICH HAS LASTED FOR SIXTEEN HOURS LOW HILLS BROAD RICE VALLEYS IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE PUDDLING THE RICE A SECOND TIME TO KILL THE WEEDS BAD ROADS PRETTY VILLAGES MUCH INDIGO FEW PASSENGERS
BESIDES WE NEED THEIR ATTACKS TO KEEP US AWAKE THAT MAKES US SEE OUR WEAKNESSES SO THAT WE MAY REMEDY THEM EXAGGERATED FLATTERY WILL DECEIVE US AND PUT US TO SLEEP
SOMETHING HAS FRIGHTENED YOU HE SAID GENTLY SEATING HIMSELF ON THE ARM OF KARAMANEH'S CHAIR AND PATTING HER HAND AS IF TO REASSURE HER TELL US ALL ABOUT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE OUR MEETING THAT NIGHT THE GIRL TURNED HER EYES FROM ME AND GLANCED UP AT STACEY
I SOUGHT FURTIVELY TO MOVE MY ARMS ONLY TO REALIZE THAT AS I HAD ANTICIPATED THE HANDCUFFS WERE CHAINED TO A RING IN THE WALL BEHIND ME THE ESTABLISHMENTS OF DOCTOR FU MANCHU WERE ALWAYS WELL PROVIDED WITH SUCH CONTRIVANCES AS THESE
I SUPPOSE I DID NOT AWAKE VERY READILY FOLLOWING THE NERVOUS VIGILANCE OF THE PAST SIX MONTHS MY TIRED NERVES IN THE ENJOYMENT OF THIS RELAXATION WERE RAPIDLY RECUPERATING
SOMETHING I KNEW OF THE HISTORY OF THAT GHASTLY SPECIMEN THAT THING NEITHER MAN NOR APE FOR WITHIN MY OWN KNOWLEDGE HAD IT NOT ATTEMPTED THE LIFE OF NAYLAND SMITH AND WAS IT NOT I WHO WITH AN AX HAD MAIMED IT IN THE INSTANT OF ONE OF ITS LAST SLAYINGS
I KNEW THAT WITH MY WRISTS HANDCUFFED BEHIND ME I LAY IN A ROOM WHICH WAS ALSO OCCUPIED BY DOCTOR FU MANCHU THIS ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY OF THE CHINAMAN'S PRESENCE WAS EVIDENCED NOT BY MY SENSES
PAINFULLY CONVERSANT WITH THE UNCANNY WEAPONS EMPLOYED BY THE HASHISHIN I KNEW NOW BEYOND ANY POSSIBILITY OF DOUBT THAT DEATH WAS BEHIND ME A PATTERING LIKE NAKED FEET SOUNDED ON THE ROAD AND WITHOUT PAUSING IN MY HEADLONG CAREER I SENT A RANDOM SHOT INTO THE BLACKNESS
HAVING DISPATCHED MY TELEGRAM I BOARDED THE SIX FIFTY FIVE I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE THE COMPARTMENT TO MYSELF AND SO DEEP IN REVERIE WAS I THAT THE TRAIN WAS ACTUALLY CLEAR OF THE PLATFORMS ERE I LEARNED THAT I HAD A COMPANION HE MUST HAVE JOINED ME AT THE MOMENT THAT THE TRAIN STARTED
TRUSTING TO PROVIDENCE TO GUIDE ME I PLUNGED DOWN THE LANE THAT TURNED TO THE LEFT AND ALMOST EXHAUSTED SAW THE GATES BEFORE ME SAW THE SWEEP OF THE DRIVE AND THE MOONLIGHT GLEAMING ON THE WINDOWS NONE OF THE WINDOWS WERE ILLUMINATED
THE HORROR OF THE THING WAS PLAYING HAVOC WITH MY OWN COMPOSURE HOWEVER THERE I LAY FETTERED IN THE SAME ROOM WITH THIS MAN WHOSE EXISTENCE WAS A MENACE TO THE ENTIRE WHITE RACE WHILST PLACIDLY HE PURSUED AN EXPERIMENT DESIGNED IF HIS OWN WORDS WERE BELIEVABLE
THEN IT MAY COME FROM MESSINA IT DOESN'T COME FROM MESSINA REPLIED THE MAN AT THE TABLE BEGINNING TO WRITE RAPIDLY
THEY WERE LOCKED WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION I HURLED MY GRIP OVER THE TOP AND CLAMBERED UP THE BARS AS I GOT ASTRIDE FROM THE BLACKNESS OF THE LANE CAME THE OMINOUS HUM AND MY HAT WENT SPINNING AWAY ACROSS THE LAWN
BUT ONLY BY AN INNER CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SAME THAT ALWAYS AWOKE INTO LIFE AT THE APPROACH NOT ONLY OF FU MANCHU IN PERSON BUT OF CERTAIN OF HIS UNCANNY SERVANTS A FAINT PERFUME HUNG IN THE AIR ABOUT ME
I LAY UPON A LONG LOW SETTEE IN A FAIRLY LARGE ROOM WHICH WAS FURNISHED AS I HAD ANTICIPATED IN AN ABSOLUTELY ORIENTAL FASHION THE TWO WINDOWS WERE SO SCREENED AS TO HAVE LOST FROM THE INTERIOR POINT OF VIEW ALL RESEMBLANCE TO EUROPEAN WINDOWS
THE NIGHT SWALLOWED HIM UP MY FEARS HAD BEEN JUSTIFIED THE MAN WAS ONE OF THE HASHISHIN A SPY OF HASSAN OF ALEPPO WHAT DID IT MEAN I CRANED FROM THE WINDOW SEARCHING THE PLATFORM RIGHT AND LEFT BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM
ON AND ON I RAN FLYING FROM AN UNKNOWN BUT AS A WARNING INSTINCT TOLD ME DEADLY PERIL RAN AS A MAN RUNS PURSUED BY DEVILS
WHAT INFORMATION HAD BURKE TO SELL HE HAD REFUSED FOR SOME REASON TO DISCUSS THE MATTER THAT EVENING AND NOW ENACTING THE PART ALLOTTED HIM BY NAYLAND SMITH HE FEIGNED SLEEP CONSISTENTLY
HAVE YOU GOT IT DEMANDED MY COMPANION AS WE ENTERED THE ROOM
WITH A SECOND PIERCING SHRIEK LOUDER THAN THAT RECENTLY UTTERED BY BURKE WAILING THROUGH THE NIGHT FROM SOMEWHERE BELOW I TURNED DESPERATELY TO THE MAN ON THE BED WHO NOW WAS BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY SILENT
WHEN THE TRAIN LEFT NORTHAMPTON I FOUND MYSELF ALONE AND I SHOULD ONLY WEARY YOU WERE I TO ATTEMPT TO RECOUNT THE TROUBLED CONJECTURES THAT BORE ME COMPANY TO BIRMINGHAM
THE QUEST OF THE PROPHET'S SLIPPER WAS ENDED IN ALL PROBABILITY THAT BLOOD STAINED RELIC WAS ALREADY EASTWARD BOUND HASSAN OF ALEPPO ITS AWFUL GUARDIAN HAD TRIUMPHED AND HAD ESCAPED RETRIBUTION EARL DEXTER WAS DEAD
THE BLACK CLOUD VEILED THE MOON AND COMPLETE DARKNESS FELL
SHE SAID AND HER SWEET VOICE WAS SLIGHTLY TREMULOUS HE MUST BE PUT ON HIS GUARD I STARTED UP WHY I SAID FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL US WHAT HAS HAPPENED
A HUGE GLASS RETORT THE BULB WAS FULLY TWO FEET IN DIAMETER FITTED WITH A LIEBIG'S CONDENSER RESTED IN A METAL FRAME AND WITHIN THE BULB FLOATING IN AN OILY SUBSTANCE WAS A FUNGUS SOME SIX INCHES HIGH
PLATTS NODDED ABSENTLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WEIRD FLAMES STROMBOLI HE SAID WE SHALL BE NEARLY THROUGH THE STRAITS BY BREAKFAST TIME
AT A LARGE AND VERY FINELY CARVED TABLE SAT DOCTOR FU MANCHU A YELLOW AND FADED VOLUME OPEN BEFORE HIM
COME DOWNSTAIRS REPLIED SMITH QUIETLY AND SEE FOR YOURSELF HE TURNED HIS HEAD ASIDE FROM THE BED VERY UNSTEADILY I FOLLOWED HIM DOWN THE STAIRS AND THROUGH THE RAMBLING OLD HOUSE OUT INTO THE STONE PAVED COURTYARD
DESPITE THE CONFUSION OF MY MIND I BECAME AWARE OF SOUNDS OUTSIDE AND BELOW ME TWICE THE THING AT THE WINDOW COUGHED THERE WAS AN INCESSANT LASH LIKE CRACKING
BRACE UP SAID SMITH LAYING HIS HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER REMEMBER HE CHOSE TO PLAY WITH FIRE ONE WILD LOOK THE MAN CAST FROM SMITH TO ME THEN WENT OFF STAGGERING TOWARD THE FARM SMITH I BEGAN
BY THE DEATH GRIN OF THE FACE THE GLEAMING FANGS WERE REVEALED AND THE BODY THE LONG YELLOW GRAY BODY RESTED OR SEEMED TO REST UPON SHORT MALFORMED LEGS WHILST ONE LONG LIMP ARM THE RIGHT
I HAD LITTLE IDEA OF ITS LOCATION BUT HE ADDED WIRE TRAIN AND WILL MEET AT H SO THAT I HAD NO UNEASINESS ON THAT SCORE I HAD CONTEMPLATED CATCHING THE TWO FORTY FIVE FROM EUSTON BUT BY THE TIME I HAD GOT MY WORK INTO SOMETHING LIKE ORDER
GO TO A LECTURE WITH HIM WITH HIM MARTIN EDEN SHE SOARED SO FAR ABOVE HIM THAT THERE SEEMED NOTHING ELSE FOR HIM TO DO THAN DIE FOR HER IT WAS THE ONLY FIT WAY IN WHICH HE COULD EXPRESS THE TREMENDOUS AND LOFTY EMOTION HE FELT FOR HER
FOR A LONG WHILE SHE WAS SURE HE WAS BEARING HER FEELING IN MIND SINCE IT COULDN'T HAVE CHANGED SINCE CHRISTMAS AND THAT WHEN SHE ARRIVED THERE SHE WOULD FIND THAT HE HAD HAD EVERYTHING ALTERED AND ALL TRACES OF VERA'S LIFE THERE REMOVED
HE HAS SAID LUCY INDEED HE HAS ALREADY IN SENDING ME YOU AND SHE SMILED UP AT HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE HAD KNOWN HER AND HE TOO HAD THE FEELING THAT HE HAD KNOWN HER EVER SINCE HE COULD REMEMBER
HIS EYES WERE SHINING LIKE AN ANGEL'S AND HIS FACE WAS TRANSFIGURED PURGED OF ALL EARTHLY DROSS AND PURE AND HOLY
A DIFFERENT BEING FROM THE INDIGNANTLY MISERABLE PERSON WHO HAD DRAGGED ABOUT THAT VERY CLIFF KILLING TIME SUCH A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE HE COULD SEE SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT SHE KNEW HE HAD TO GO SHE WAS GRATEFUL AND IMMENSELY EXPRESSIVE OF HER GRATITUDE
THROUGH HER HEART CREPT THE THOUGHT OF WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE WHEN DUSK CAME AND HE WENT AWAY FOR THE LAST TIME AND SHE WOULD BE ALONE ALL ALONE IN THE SILENT HOUSE AND UPSTAIRS THAT STRANGE WONDERFUL ABSORBED THING THAT USED TO BE HER FATHER
CLINGING TO EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE DARK SO THEY TALKED ON IN SUBDUED VOICES AS PEOPLE DO WHO ARE IN SOME HOLY PLACE SITTING CLOSE TOGETHER LOOKING OUT AT THE STARLIT SEA DARKNESS AND COOLNESS GATHERING ROUND THEM
YOU FORGET HOW I TALKED WHEN YOU FIRST MET ME I HAVE LEARNED A NEW LANGUAGE SINCE THEN BEFORE THAT TIME I TALKED AS THAT GIRL TALKS NOW I CAN MANAGE TO MAKE MYSELF UNDERSTOOD SUFFICIENTLY IN YOUR LANGUAGE TO EXPLAIN THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT OTHER GIRL'S LANGUAGE
WAS TO HAVE LIVED AND LOVED WELL AND HE WAS ONLY TWENTY ONE AND HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE HIS HAND TREMBLED AS HE HUNG UP THE RECEIVER AND HE WAS WEAK FROM THE ORGAN WHICH HAD STIRRED HIM
REMEMBERING HIS WORDS AND WHOLE HEARTEDLY AGREEING
AND HE HAD OTHER THINGS TO SEE TO BESIDES HER AFFAIRS HIS OWN PATIENTS SCATTERED WIDELY OVER A LONELY COUNTRYSIDE WEMYSS HAD NOTHING TO SEE TO HE COULD CONCENTRATE ENTIRELY ON LUCY
HE ANSWERED AND THEY STARED AT EACH OTHER ASTONISHED AT THE NATURE OF THE BOND BETWEEN THEM AT ITS CLOSENESS AT THE WAY IT SEEMED ALMOST MIRACULOUSLY TO HAVE BEEN ARRANGED THAT THEY SHOULD MEET ON THE CREST OF DESPAIR AND SAVE EACH OTHER
ONE SHE COULD SO PERFECTLY AGREE WITH AND UNDERSTAND SHE FELT QUITE SORRY SHE HAD NOTHING IN HER MIND IN THE WAY OF THOUGHTS SHE WAS ASHAMED OF TO TELL HIM THEN AND THERE BUT THERE WASN'T A DOUBT
AND HEADS AGAINST THE FELLOWS SHOULDERS WHERE THE STREETS WERE UNLIGHTED BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT SHE WASN'T THAT KIND OF A GIRL HE MUST DO SOMETHING
AND SHE HAD THE RELIEVED EYES OF A CHILD WHO HAS BEEN LEFT ALONE IN THE DARK AND SEES ITS MOTHER COMING IN WITH A CANDLE VERA USEDN'T TO LOOK LIKE THAT VERA HAD ACCEPTED EVERYTHING HE DID FOR HER AS A MATTER OF COURSE
IT WAS THE SUBLIME ABNEGATION OF TRUE LOVE THAT COMES TO ALL LOVERS AND IT CAME TO HIM THERE AT THE TELEPHONE IN A WHIRLWIND OF FIRE AND GLORY AND TO DIE FOR HER HE FELT
HE IS YOU YOU AND HE ARE ONE IN MIND AND SOUL NOW AND WHEN HE IS YOUR HUSBAND YOU AND HE WILL BECOME PERFECT AND COMPLETE BY BEING ONE IN BODY AS WELL EVERARD LUCY LUCY EVERARD
YOU'RE TO GO TO SLEEP AND NOT THINK OF ANYTHING WEMYSS ORDERED AS SHE WENT SLOWLY UPSTAIRS
IT WAS WEMYSS WHO HAD DONE ALL THE THINKING FOR HER AND IN THE SPARE MOMENTS BETWEEN HIS VISITS TO THE UNDERTAKER ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENTS AND TO THE DOCTOR ABOUT THE CERTIFICATE AND TO THE VICAR ABOUT THE BURIAL
NATURALLY HE WASN'T GOING TO LET THE POOR LITTLE GIRL SLEEP ALONE IN THAT HOUSE WITH A DEAD BODY AND THE STRANGE SERVANTS WHO HAD BEEN HIRED TOGETHER WITH THE HOUSE AND KNEW NOTHING EITHER ABOUT HER OR HER FATHER PROBABLY GETTING RESTIVE AS NIGHT DREW ON
OF HIS LIFE AND OF THE REGULAR HEALTHY CALM WITH WHICH IT HAD PROCEEDED TILL A WEEK AGO WHY THIS CALM SHOULD HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED AND SO CRUELLY HE COULDN'T IMAGINE IT WASN'T AS IF HE HAD DESERVED IT
CROOKED IT VERY SLIGHTLY AND WITH SECRET TENTATIVENESS NOT INVITINGLY BUT JUST CASUALLY AS THOUGH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO WALK THAT WAY AND THEN THE WONDERFUL THING HAPPENED HE FELT HER HAND UPON HIS ARM
THIS WOULD PUT HIM ON THE INSIDE HE SHOULD BE ON THE OUTSIDE SHOULD HE THEREFORE DROP HER ARM AND CHANGE OVER AND IF HE DID SO WOULD HE HAVE TO REPEAT THE MANOEUVRE THE NEXT TIME AND THE NEXT
YET THE WILLOWS HAUNTED HER AND WHAT A COMFORT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO TELL HIM ALL SHE FELT AND LET HIM HELP HER TO GET RID OF HER GROWING OBSESSION BY LAUGHING AT HER WHAT A COMFORT IF
YOU'LL LIKE THE VIEW FROM YOUR SITTING ROOM AT THE WILLOWS SHE NATURALLY WANTED TO CRY OUT THAT SHE WOULDN'T AND ASK HIM HOW HE COULD SUPPOSE SHE WOULD LIKE WHAT WAS TO HER A VIEW FOR EVER ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH
DELICIOUS THRILLS RAN THROUGH HIM AT THE CONTACT AND FOR A FEW SWEET MOMENTS IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD LEFT THE SOLID EARTH AND WAS FLYING WITH HER THROUGH THE AIR BUT HE WAS SOON BACK AGAIN PERTURBED BY A NEW COMPLICATION THEY WERE CROSSING THE STREET
FOR HE KNEW THAT MISTER HIGGINBOTHAM'S FERRET EYES WERE FIXED UPON HIM IT WAS NOT MUCH THAT RUTH WANTED TO SAY
MISTER HIGGINBOTHAM WHO HAD CALLED HIM JEERED MARTIN WENT TO THE TELEPHONE IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM AND FELT A WAVE OF WARMTH RUSH THROUGH HIM AS HE HEARD RUTH'S VOICE IN HIS BATTLE WITH THE SONNET HE HAD FORGOTTEN HER EXISTENCE
AND MOSES RECEIVED HIS ADVICE VERY KINDLY AND ACTED ACCORDING TO HIS SUGGESTION NOR DID HE CONCEAL THE INVENTION OF THIS METHOD NOR PRETEND TO IT HIMSELF BUT INFORMED THE MULTITUDE WHO IT WAS THAT INVENTED IT
HE BADE HIS BROTHER AARON AND HUR THEIR SISTER MIRIAM'S HUSBAND TO STAND ON EACH SIDE OF HIM AND TAKE HOLD OF HIS HANDS AND NOT PERMIT HIS WEARINESS TO PREVENT IT BUT TO ASSIST HIM IN THE EXTENSION OF HIS HANDS
AND IT CAME TO A CLOSE FIGHT HAND TO HAND BOTH SIDES SHOWING GREAT ALACRITY AND ENCOURAGING ONE ANOTHER
EVERY ONE STILL GOING TO HIM AND SUPPOSING THAT THEY SHOULD THEN ONLY OBTAIN JUSTICE IF HE WERE THE ARBITRATOR AND THOSE THAT LOST THEIR CAUSES THOUGHT IT NO HARM WHILE THEY THOUGHT THEY LOST THEM JUSTLY AND NOT BY PARTIALITY
AND THAT THEY ARE TO JUDGE THEMSELVES TO HAVE ALL THESE ADVANTAGES IN THE DIVINE ASSISTANCE THEY ARE ALSO TO SUPPOSE THE ENEMY'S ARMY TO BE SMALL UNARMED WEAK AND SUCH AS WANT THOSE CONVENIENCES WHICH THEY KNOW MUST BE WANTED WHEN IT IS GOD'S WILL
BY THESE MEANS TWO ADVANTAGES WILL BE GAINED THE HEBREWS WILL HAVE JUSTICE DONE THEM AND THOU WILT BE ABLE TO ATTEND CONSTANTLY ON GOD
BUT AFTERWARD HE TOOK HIM TO HIMSELF
AND WHAT THOU HAST DONE BY MINISTERING UNDER GOD TO THE PEOPLE'S PRESERVATION PERMIT THEREFORE THE DETERMINATION OF COMMON CAUSES TO BE DONE BY OTHERS BUT DO THOU RESERVE THYSELF TO THE ATTENDANCE ON GOD ONLY
THE LORD THE CONQUEROR HE ALSO FORETOLD THAT THE AMALEKITES SHOULD UTTERLY BE DESTROYED AND THAT HEREAFTER NONE OF THEM SHOULD REMAIN BECAUSE THEY FOUGHT AGAINST THE HEBREWS AND THIS WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WILDERNESS AND IN THEIR DISTRESS ALSO
AND PATIENT TO UNDERGO LABORS OF GREAT ABILITIES TO UNDERSTAND AND TO SPEAK WHAT WAS PROPER AND VERY SERIOUS IN THE WORSHIP OF GOD
THOSE THAT INDUCED THE REST TO DO SO WERE SUCH AS INHABITED GOBOLITIS AND PETRA THEY WERE CALLED AMALEKITES AND WERE THE MOST WARLIKE OF THE NATIONS THAT LIVED THEREABOUT AND WHOSE KINGS EXHORTED ONE ANOTHER
OF THE TRIBE OF EPHRAIM OVER THEM
THAT THEY WERE TO SUPPOSE THEIR OWN ARMY TO BE NUMEROUS WANTING NOTHING NEITHER WEAPONS NOR MONEY NOR PROVISIONS NOR SUCH OTHER CONVENIENCES AS WHEN MEN ARE IN POSSESSION OF THEY FIGHT UNDAUNTEDLY
AND GOING GRADUALLY ON HE CAME TO MOUNT SINAI IN THREE MONTHS TIME AFTER THEY WERE REMOVED OUT OF EGYPT AT WHICH MOUNTAIN AS WE HAVE BEFORE RELATED THE VISION OF THE BUSH AND THE OTHER WONDERFUL APPEARANCES HAD HAPPENED CHAPTER THREE
AND LET THERE BE ONE COMMANDER OVER EACH NUMBER TO BE DENOMINATED FROM THE NUMBER OF THOSE OVER WHOM THEY ARE RULERS BUT SUCH AS THE WHOLE MULTITUDE HAVE TRIED AND DO APPROVE OF
ONE WITH ANOTHER BUT IF ANY GREAT CAUSE ARISE LET THEM BRING THE COGNIZANCE OF IT BEFORE THE RULERS OF A HIGHER DIGNITY BUT IF ANY GREAT DIFFICULTY ARISE THAT IS TOO HARD FOR EVEN THEIR DETERMINATION LET THEM SEND IT TO THEE
BUT THESE WERE AGAINST FAMINE AND THIRST THINGS INDEED THAT ARE IN THEIR OWN NATURE INSUPERABLE AS ALSO AGAINST MOUNTAINS AND THAT SEA WHICH AFFORDED THEM NO WAY FOR ESCAPING
YET HAD ALL THESE DIFFICULTIES BEEN CONQUERED BY GOD'S GRACIOUS KINDNESS TO THEM SO HE EXHORTED THEM TO BE COURAGEOUS AT THIS TIME AND TO LOOK UPON THEIR ENTIRE PROSPERITY
HE PERMITTED THE HEBREWS TO REST FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN HE BROUGHT THEM OUT AFTER THE FIGHT IN ORDER OF BATTLE
WHO THEN CALLED TOGETHER THE PRINCES OF THEIR TRIBES AND THEIR CHIEF MEN
AND ADVISED HIM TO LEAVE THE TROUBLE OF LESSER CAUSES TO OTHERS
THEN DIVIDE THEM INTO FIVE HUNDREDS AND AGAIN INTO HUNDREDS AND INTO FIFTIES AND SET RULERS OVER EACH OF THEM WHO MAY DISTINGUISH THEM INTO THIRTIES AND KEEP THEM IN ORDER AND AT LAST NUMBER THEM BY TWENTIES AND BY TENS
HE ALSO GAVE A PARTICULAR EXHORTATION TO THE PRINCIPAL MEN OF THE HEBREWS AND ENCOURAGED THE WHOLE ARMY AS IT STOOD ARMED BEFORE HIM
FOR THAT CERTAIN OTHERS OF THE HEBREWS MIGHT BE FOUND THAT WERE FIT TO DETERMINE CAUSES BUT THAT NOBODY BUT A MOSES COULD TAKE OF THE SAFETY OF SO MANY TEN THOUSANDS BE THEREFORE SAYS HE INSENSIBLE OF THINE OWN VIRTUE
FOR THEY NOT ONLY OVERCAME THOSE THAT FOUGHT AGAINST THEM BUT TERRIFIED ALSO THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS AND GOT GREAT AND SPLENDID ADVANTAGES WHICH THEY OBTAINED OF THEIR ENEMIES BY THEIR HARD PAINS IN THIS BATTLE FOR WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN THE ENEMY'S CAMP
AND WHEN HE HAD THUS ANIMATED THE ARMY BOTH BY HIS WORDS AND WORKS AND PREPARED EVERY THING HE RETIRED TO A MOUNTAIN AND COMMITTED THE ARMY TO GOD
UNDER THEIR RULERS OF THOUSANDS AND RULERS OF HUNDREDS WHO LIVED WITHOUT ORDER BEFORE
AND RUMORS ABOUT THEM RAN ABROAD THIS MADE THE INHABITANTS OF THOSE COUNTRIES TO BE IN NO SMALL FEAR ACCORDINGLY THEY SENT AMBASSADORS TO ONE ANOTHER AND EXHORTED ONE ANOTHER TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND TO ENDEAVOR TO DESTROY THESE MEN
BUT TO CRUSH THEM BEFORE THEY GATHER STRENGTH AND COME TO BE IN PROSPERITY AND PERHAPS ATTACK THEM FIRST IN A HOSTILE MANNER AS PRESUMING UPON OUR INDOLENCE IN NOT ATTACKING THEM BEFORE AND THAT WE OUGHT TO AVENGE OURSELVES OF THEM FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE WILDERNESS
HE ALSO APPOINTED A SMALL PARTY OF THE ARMED MEN TO BE NEAR THE WATER AND TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN AND THE WOMEN AND OF THE ENTIRE CAMP
WHEN THIS WAS DONE THE HEBREWS CONQUERED THE AMALEKITES BY MAIN FORCE AND INDEED THEY HAD ALL PERISHED UNLESS THE APPROACH OF THE NIGHT HAD OBLIGED THE HEBREWS TO DESIST FROM KILLING ANY MORE SO OUR FOREFATHERS OBTAINED A MOST SIGNAL AND MOST SEASONABLE VICTORY
NOT ONLY FOR THE PRESENT BUT FOR THE FUTURE AGES ALSO FOR THEY NOT ONLY MADE SLAVES OF THE BODIES OF THEIR ENEMIES BUT SUBDUED THEIR MINDS ALSO
AND SUCH A ONE AS HAD RUN AWAY FROM SLAVERY UNDER THE EGYPTIANS LAY IN WAIT TO RUIN THEM WHICH ARMY THEY WERE NOT IN COMMON PRUDENCE AND REGARD TO THEIR OWN SAFETY TO OVERLOOK
THEY GOT ALSO THE PREY OF THEIR CATTLE AND OF WHATSOEVER USES TO FOLLOW CAMPS WHEN THEY REMOVE FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER SO THE HEBREWS NOW VALUED THEMSELVES UPON THEIR COURAGE AND CLAIMED GREAT MERIT FOR THEIR VALOR
THE LADY CAUSED THESE THREE DISTRESSFUL KNIGHTS TO BE BURIED WELL AND WORSHIPFULLY IN A RICH ABBEY IN THAT PLACE SHE OFFERED THEIR MASS PENNY AND GAVE RICH OFFERINGS OF SILVER AND OF LIGHTS BESIDES MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON THEM IN THAT DAY
I'LL ALWAYS BE UGLY NOW BECAUSE ANGEL IS NOT HERE AND I HAVE NOBODY TO TAKE CARE OF ME MY HUSBAND THAT WAS IS GONE AWAY AND NEVER WILL LOVE ME ANY MORE BUT I LOVE HIM JUST THE SAME AND HATE ALL OTHER MEN AND LIKE TO MAKE EM THINK SCORNFULLY OF ME
THERE WERE FEW TREES OR NONE THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE GROWN IN THE HEDGES BEING MERCILESSLY PLASHED DOWN WITH THE QUICKSET BY THE TENANT FARMERS THE NATURAL ENEMIES OF TREE BUSH AND BRAKE IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE AHEAD OF HER
THE FOUR BODIES WERE FALLEN ON THE FIELD AND LAY WITH THOSE WHO HAD PERISHED IN THAT DAY BUT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT MISCHIEF THESE FOUR LOVERS HAD DONE THEIR ADVERSARIES THEIR SHIELDS WERE CAST DESPITEFULLY WITHOUT THE LISTS BUT IN THIS THEIR FOEMEN DID WRONGFULLY
AND THIS IS MY OPINION I BLUNDERED I THINK MORE EDIFYINGLY AT LEAST FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF MY OWN INSTRUCTION I VENTURED UPON SEVERAL THEMES WITH A GREATER FRANKNESS THAN I HAD USED IN ANTICIPATIONS
THUS TESS WALKS ON A FIGURE WHICH IS PART OF THE LANDSCAPE A FIELDWOMAN PURE AND SIMPLE IN WINTER GUISE A GRAY SERGE CAPE A RED WOOLLEN CRAVAT A STUFF SKIRT COVERED BY A WHITEY BROWN ROUGH WRAPPER
THEY WERE SET UPON BY THEIR ADVERSARIES AND ASSAILED SO FIERCELY THAT THREE WERE SLAIN OUTRIGHT AS TO THE FOURTH HE YET LIVED BUT ALTOGETHER MAULED AND SHAKEN FOR HIS THIGH WAS BROKEN AND A SPEAR HEAD REMAINED IN HIS SIDE
THERE ARE WORKS AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM THAT ARE BEST BEGUN WITH A PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR AND HERE INDEED BECAUSE OF A VERY NATURAL MISUNDERSTANDING THIS IS THE ONLY COURSE TO TAKE THROUGHOUT THESE PAPERS SOUNDS A NOTE A DISTINCTIVE AND PERSONAL NOTE
BUT YOU USED TO BE AS GOOD A DAIRYWOMAN AS I YES BUT I'VE GOT OUT O THAT SINCE I TOOK TO DRINK
ON WHICH MOVING PICTURES INTERMITTENTLY APPEAR
WHAT SHALL I DO FOR NEVER SHALL I KNOW HAPPINESS AGAIN THESE FOUR KNIGHTS HAD SET THEIR HEARTS UPON ME AND DESPITE THEIR GREAT TREASURE ESTEEMED MY LOVE AS RICHER THAN ALL THEIR WEALTH ALAS FOR THE FAIR AND VALIANT KNIGHT ALAS FOR THE LOYAL AND GENEROUS MAN
NEVER SINCE SHE HAD WORKED AMONG THE STUBBLE AT MARLOTT SHE ALSO BY A FELICITOUS THOUGHT TOOK A HANDKERCHIEF FROM HER BUNDLE AND TIED IT ROUND HER FACE UNDER HER BONNET COVERING HER CHIN AND HALF HER CHEEKS AND TEMPLES
THEN WITH HER LITTLE SCISSORS BY THE AID OF A POCKET LOOKING GLASS SHE MERCILESSLY NIPPED HER EYEBROWS OFF AND THUS INSURED AGAINST AGGRESSIVE ADMIRATION SHE WENT ON HER UNEVEN WAY
IT WILL BE EVIDENT TO THE EXPERIENCED READER THAT BY OMITTING CERTAIN SPECULATIVE AND METAPHYSICAL ELEMENTS AND BY ELABORATING INCIDENT THIS BOOK MIGHT HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO A STRAIGHTFORWARD STORY
PERCHANCE I MAY FIND YOU COMFORT FAIR FRIEND REPLIED SHE
THERE DWELT A DAME WHO WAS DEARLY HELD OF ALL FOR REASON OF THE MUCH GOOD THAT WAS FOUND IN HER THIS LADY WAS PASSING FAIR OF BODY APT IN BOOK AS ANY CLERK AND MEETLY SCHOOLED IN EVERY GRACE THAT IT BECOMETH DAME TO HAVE
THEY WALKED ON TOGETHER AND SOON REACHED THE FARMHOUSE WHICH WAS ALMOST SUBLIME IN ITS DREARINESS
THEY GET INTO MIGHTY TANGLES AND TROUBLES WITH WOMEN AND HE HAS HAD HIS TROUBLES
SOUTHERLY AT MANY MILES DISTANCE AND OVER THE HILLS AND RIDGES COASTWARD
THE FORM WHICH APPEALS MOST READILY TO WHAT IS CALLED THE SERIOUS READER THE READER WHO IS OFTEN NO MORE THAN THE SOLEMNLY IMPATIENT PARASITE OF GREAT QUESTIONS HE LIKES EVERYTHING IN HARD HEAVY LINES BLACK AND WHITE YES AND NO
THIS PERSON IS SPOKEN OF AS THE BOTANIST AND HE IS A LEANER RATHER TALLER GRAVER AND MUCH LESS GARRULOUS MAN HIS FACE IS WEAKLY HANDSOME AND DONE IN TONES OF GREY HE IS FAIRISH AND GREY EYED
EACH CRIED HER NAME WITHIN THE LISTS NOW WHEN EASTERTIDE WAS COME A GREAT TOURNAMENT WAS PROCLAIMED TO BE HELD BEYOND THE WALLS OF NANTES THAT RICH CITY THE FOUR LOVERS WERE THE APPELLANTS IN THIS TOURNEY
SHE ENDED WITH THE HEAVY AND COURSE PURSUITS WHICH SHE LIKED LEAST WORK ON ARABLE LAND WORK OF SUCH ROUGHNESS INDEED AS SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE DELIBERATELY VOLUTEERED FOR
AND SHE FOUND THAT IMMEDIATELY WITHIN THE GABLE
I HAVE WRITTEN INTO IT AS WELL AS I CAN THE HERETICAL METAPHYSICAL SCEPTICISM UPON WHICH ALL MY THINKING RESTS AND I HAVE INSERTED CERTAIN SECTIONS REFLECTING UPON THE ESTABLISHED METHODS OF SOCIOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE
FROM THE NET WHEREIN THEY WERE TAKEN BUT I FIND MY LIFE MORE BITTER THAN MY COMRADES FOUND THE GRAVE I SEE YOU ON YOUR GOINGS AND COMINGS ABOUT THE HOUSE I MAY SPEAK WITH YOU BOTH MATINS AND VESPERS
NOR WAS THE CHIVALRY OF NANTES BACKWARD IN THIS QUARREL BUT TILL THE VESPERS OF THE TOURNAMENT WAS COME THEY STAYED THEMSELVES WITHIN THE LISTS AND STRUCK STOUTLY FOR THEIR LORD AFTER THE FOUR LOVERS HAD LACED THEIR HARNESS UPON THEM
MARIAN PAUSED BUT YOU BE A GENTLEMAN'S WIFE AND IT SEEMS HARDLY FAIR THAT YOU SHOULD LIVE LIKE THIS
AND AS ACCEPTANCE IN ANY VARIETY OF THESE GREW HOPELESS APPLIED NEXT FOR THE LESS LIGHT TILL
IF YOU ENGAGE YOU'LL BE SET SWEDE HACKING THAT'S WHAT I BE DOING BUT YOU WON'T LIKE IT O ANYTHING WILL YOU SPEAK FOR ME YOU WILL DO BETTER BY SPEAKING FOR YOURSELF VERY WELL NOW MARIAN REMEMBER
THOUGH THE EVENING WAS COLD WORE THE PRINT GOWN AND THE TILT BONNET OF SUMMER TIME TESS INSTINCTIVELY THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE MARIAN AND WHEN SHE CAME NEAR ENOUGH TO BE DISTINGUISHABLE IN THE GLOOM SURELY ENOUGH IT WAS SHE MARIAN WAS EVEN STOUTER AND REDDER IN THE FACE THAN FORMERLY
NOTHING ABOUT HIM IF I GET THE PLACE
BUT OVER AGAINST THIS WRITER HERE PRESENTED THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER EARTHLY PERSON IN THE BOOK WHO GATHERS HIMSELF TOGETHER
AND ALL MEN HELD THEM IN SORE DISPLEASURE GREAT WERE THE LAMENTATION AND THE CRY WHEN THE NEWS OF THIS MISCHANCE WAS NOISED ABOUT THE CITY SUCH A TUMULT OF MOURNING WAS NEVER BEFORE HEARD FOR THE WHOLE CITY WAS MOVED
MADE THEM CONTENTED BROUGHT THEM OUT FROM EGYPT AND LED THEM TO THE HOLY LAND THIS PEOPLE FROM THE DEPTHS OF DEGRADATION WERE LIFTED UP TO THE HEIGHT OF GLORY THEY WERE CAPTIVE THEY BECAME FREE
IT IS BEYOND DOUBT THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN ASSISTED BY AN OMNIPOTENT POWER CONSIDER ALSO WHAT TRIALS AND DIFFICULTIES ARISE FOR PEOPLE TO PREVENT AN ACT OF CRUELTY MOSES STRUCK DOWN AN EGYPTIAN
WHO WAS KNOWN AMONG MEN AS A MURDERER WHO THROUGH FEAR HAD FOR A LONG TIME REMAINED IN CONCEALMENT AND WHO HAD BECOME A SHEPHERD ESTABLISH SO GREAT A CAUSE WHEN THE WISEST PHILOSOPHERS ON EARTH HAVE NOT DISPLAYED ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THIS INFLUENCE
A WORK WHICH ALL THE VICTORIOUS GOVERNMENTS WITH ALL THEIR HOSTS ARE UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH CONSIDER WHAT WAS THE FATE OF SO MANY AND DIVERSE EMPIRES AND PEOPLES THE ROMAN EMPIRE FRANCE GERMANY RUSSIA ENGLAND
TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCES THEY OVERCAME HIM AND BROUGHT HIM INTO DIREST DISTRESS AT LAST THEY CROWNED HIM WITH THE CROWN OF THORNS AND CRUCIFIED HIM BUT CHRIST WHILE APPARENTLY IN THE DEEPEST MISERY AND AFFLICTION PROCLAIMED
MOREOVER IN THE DAYS OF CHRIST THE MORALS OF THE WHOLE WORLD AND THE CONDITION OF THE ISRAELITES HAD BECOME COMPLETELY CONFUSED AND CORRUPTED AND ISRAEL HAD FALLEN INTO A STATE OF THE UTMOST DEGRADATION MISERY AND BONDAGE
THAT IS TO SAY HE MUST EDUCATE INTELLIGENCE AND THOUGHT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY MAY ATTAIN COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT SO THAT KNOWLEDGE AND SCIENCE MAY INCREASE AND THE REALITY OF THINGS THE MYSTERIES OF BEINGS AND THE PROPERTIES OF EXISTENCE MAY BE DISCOVERED
WHO ARE ATTACHED TO THE BIBLE AND DENY CHRIST OR IN THE PAPAL COURT
IF A MAN BE LEFT ALONE IN A WILDERNESS WHERE HE SEES NONE OF HIS OWN KIND HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BECOME A MERE BRUTE IT IS THEN CLEAR THAT AN EDUCATOR IS NEEDED BUT EDUCATION IS OF THREE KINDS MATERIAL HUMAN
YOU WILL FIND THAT ALL ARE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF ORGANIZATION
HE INVENTED THE TELEGRAPH WHICH IS THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE EAST AND THE WEST IT IS EVIDENT THEN THAT MAN RULES OVER NATURE NOW WHEN YOU BEHOLD IN EXISTENCE SUCH ORGANIZATIONS ARRANGEMENTS AND LAWS
ONE HOLY SOUL GIVES LIFE TO THE WORLD OF HUMANITY CHANGES THE ASPECT OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE CAUSES INTELLIGENCE TO PROGRESS VIVIFIES SOULS
THAT AMONG SURROUNDING NATIONS IF ONE WISHED TO PRAISE A MAN ONE SAID SURELY HE IS AN ISRAELITE
THESE OBVIOUS ARGUMENTS ARE ADDUCED FOR WEAK SOULS BUT IF THE INNER PERCEPTION BE OPEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND CLEAR PROOFS BECOME VISIBLE THUS WHEN MAN FEELS THE INDWELLING SPIRIT
THE SAME IS TRUE WITH RESPECT TO ANIMALS NOTICE THAT WHEN THE ANIMAL IS TRAINED IT BECOMES DOMESTIC AND ALSO THAT MAN
THAT THERE MUST BE ONE WHO IS IN HEALTH
AND FROM THINGS PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES CONCLUSIONS AS TO INTELLECTUAL THINGS MAY BE DEDUCED HE MUST ALSO IMPART SPIRITUAL EDUCATION SO THAT INTELLIGENCE AND COMPREHENSION MAY PENETRATE THE METAPHYSICAL WORLD
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD OF EXISTENCE IT IS THE SAME THE SMALLEST CREATED THING PROVES THAT THERE IS A CREATOR FOR INSTANCE THIS PIECE OF BREAD PROVES THAT IT HAS A MAKER PRAISE BE TO GOD
IT IS CERTAIN AND INDISPUTABLE THAT THE CREATOR OF MAN IS NOT LIKE MAN BECAUSE A POWERLESS CREATURE CANNOT CREATE ANOTHER BEING THE MAKER THE CREATOR HAS TO POSSESS ALL PERFECTIONS IN ORDER THAT HE MAY CREATE
AND SPIRITUAL MATERIAL EDUCATION IS CONCERNED WITH THE PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE BODY
THEY WERE NOT REAL EDUCATORS THEREFORE IT MUST BE OUR TASK TO PROVE TO THE THOUGHTFUL BY REASONABLE ARGUMENTS THE PROPHETHOOD OF MOSES OF CHRIST AND OF THE OTHER DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS
NOTHING SHORT OF A DIVINE POWER COULD ACCOMPLISH SO GREAT A WORK WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER THIS WITH JUSTICE FOR THIS IS THE OFFICE OF JUSTICE A CAUSE WHICH ALL THE GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLES OF THE WORLD
SEE WHAT A PERFECT EDUCATOR ABRAHAM WAS
THIS EDUCATION IS COMMON TO ANIMALS AND MAN HUMAN EDUCATION SIGNIFIES CIVILIZATION AND PROGRESS THAT IS TO SAY GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION CHARITABLE WORKS TRADES ARTS AND HANDICRAFTS SCIENCES
AND EVEN HIS OWN FAMILY BY REJECTING ALL THEIR GODS ALONE AND WITHOUT HELP HE RESISTED A POWERFUL TRIBE A TASK WHICH IS NEITHER SIMPLE NOR EASY IT IS AS IF IN THIS DAY SOMEONE WERE TO GO TO A CHRISTIAN PEOPLE
OTHERWISE THE PAINTING WOULD HAVE CREATED ITSELF HOWEVER PERFECT THE PICTURE MAY BE
IF THEY REMAIN WITHOUT A CULTIVATOR THEY WILL BE FRUITLESS AND WITHOUT FRUIT THEY ARE USELESS BUT IF THEY RECEIVE THE CARE OF A GARDENER
CAN THE CREATION BE PERFECT AND THE CREATOR IMPERFECT CAN A PICTURE BE A MASTERPIECE AND THE PAINTER IMPERFECT IN HIS ART FOR IT IS HIS ART AND HIS CREATION MOREOVER THE PICTURE CANNOT BE LIKE THE PAINTER
THESE FACTS ARE UNDENIABLE
FROM THE SMALLEST INVISIBLE ATOM UP TO SUCH LARGE BODIES OF THE WORLD OF EXISTENCE AS THE GLOBE OF THE SUN OR THE OTHER GREAT STARS AND LUMINOUS SPHERES WHETHER YOU REGARD THEIR ARRANGEMENT THEIR COMPOSITION THEIR FORM OR THEIR MOVEMENT
THE MANIFESTATION OF THE WORDS LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE
SEE WHAT A POWER IT IS THAT ENABLED A MAN WHO WAS A FUGITIVE FROM HIS COUNTRY TO FOUND SUCH A FAMILY TO ESTABLISH SUCH A FAITH AND TO PROMULGATE SUCH TEACHINGS
IF THERE WERE NO EDUCATOR THERE WOULD BE NO SUCH THINGS AS COMFORTS CIVILIZATION
CHRIST AFTERWARD CHRIST CAME SAYING I AM BORN OF THE HOLY SPIRIT THOUGH IT IS NOW EASY FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO BELIEVE THIS ASSERTION
IT FLOWS WITHOUT WILL OR INTELLIGENCE THE NATURE OF THE SUN IS RADIANCE IT SHINES WITHOUT WILL OR INTELLIGENCE THE NATURE OF VAPOR IS TO ASCEND IT ASCENDS WITHOUT WILL OR INTELLIGENCE
NANNY'S CHANCE WAS NOT A FAILURE AND WHEN SHE SAW THE NEXT DANDELIONS HE BROUGHT HER ALL THE SUNSHINE CAME BACK INTO THE WORLD BRIGHTER THAN EVER FOR JACK WELL MIGHT IT SEEM SO
WITH WIDE FRONT EXPOSING THE LOWER PART OF THE CHEEKS ONE HAVING A BROAD FACE WEARS A CLOSER FRONT AND IF THE JAW BE WIDE IT IS IN APPEARANCE DIMINISHED BY BRINGING THE CORNERS OF THE BONNET
AND THE VULGAR WOMAN WITH FEATURES CORRESPONDINGLY RUDE WILL EASILY BE SEEN THROUGH THE INAPPROPRIATE MASK IN WHICH HER MILLINER OR DRESSMAKER MAY HAVE INVESTED HER
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE LITTLE BLIND GIRL WHO LOOKED UP AT HIM SO IMPLORINGLY THAT HE COULDN'T RESIST THE MUTE APPEAL THE DOCTOR'S GOING OUT BUT MAYBE HE'LL SEE YOU A MINUTE
HONEST JOHN FLOYD DID HIS DUTY BUT HE DIDN'T FIND THE OWNER SO THE OLD PURSE CAME BACK AT LAST AND NOW JACK COULD KEEP IT WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE
IF IN ANY INDIVIDUAL LOCOMOTIVE SYMMETRY OF FIGURE IS COMBINED WITH DIRECT AND LINEAR GAIT
IF VIEWED BEHIND THE FEET AT EVERY STEP ARE THROWN OUT BACKWARD AND SOMEWHAT LATERALLY THE KNEES ARE CERTAINLY MUCH INCLINED INWARD IF VIEWED IN FRONT THE DRESS AT EVERY STEP
NANNY WAS VERY PATIENT BUT BY AND BY MISSUS QUINN BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT SENDING HER TO SOME ALMSHOUSE FOR SHE WAS TOO POOR TO BE BURDENED WITH A HELPLESS CHILD
THEN PURPLE IS USED WHEN IT IS THE FAULT OF A FACE TO CONTAIN TOO MUCH BLUE AND YELLOW
AND CARE IS THEN TAKEN THAT THESE LININGS DO NOT COME INTO THE DIRECT VIEW OF THE OBSERVER AND OPERATE PREJUDICIALLY ON THE FACE BY CONTRAST OVERPOWERING THE LITTLE COLOR WHICH BY REFLECTION THEY SHOULD HEIGHTEN
THE BOOKS THAT WOULD GIVE HIM A TASTE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH WAS MORE ENTICING TO HIS WIDE AWAKE YOUNG MIND THAN CLOTHES AND FOOD TO HIS POOR LITTLE BODY IT WASN'T AN EASY THING TO DO
NANNY WAS ASLEEP WHEN IT HAPPENED AND AS THEY SAT COUNTING THE DINGY BILLS MISSUS QUINN SAID TO THE BOY JACK YOU'D BETTER KEEP THIS FOR YOURSELF I
THAT WENT TO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO HEARD IT JACK'S FACE I SEE IT OH I SEE IT ONLY A FRECKLED ROUND FACE WITH WET EYES AND TIGHTLY SET LIPS
AND FOR THIS HE PAID BY CARRYING THE BUNDLES AND GETTING THE CINDERS FOR HER FIRE FOOD AND CLOTHES HE PICKED UP AS HE COULD AND HIS ONLY FRIEND WAS LITTLE NANNY
SOON FINDING THAT MANY COMFORTS QUIETLY GOT INTO HIS LIFE THAT MUCH HELP WAS GIVEN WITHOUT WORDS AND THAT THE DAYS OF HUNGER AND RAGS HEAVY BURDENS AND DUSTY ASH HEAPS WERE GONE BY FOR EVER
DOCTOR WILKINSON'S COOK TOLD ME ONCE THAT HE DONE SOMETHING TO A LADY'S EYES AND ASKED A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IT JACK SIGHED A LONG HOPELESS SIGH
HIS HEARTY BOY'S APPETITE DID LONG FOR BETTER FOOD AND OH
AS GREEN AROUND THE FACE HEIGHTENS A FAINT RED IN THE CHEEKS BY CONTRAST SO THE PINK LINING OF THE BONNET AIDS IT BY REFLECTION
AND ASSUMED A CERTAIN SINEWY OR BONY APPEARANCE
IT'S ALL LUCK ABOUT NANNY'S EYES AND MAYBE YOU ARE ONLY THROWING AWAY A CHANCE YOU'LL NEVER HAVE AGAIN JACK LEANED HIS HEAD ON HIS ARMS AND STARED AT THE MONEY ALL SPREAD OUT THERE
TO THE DEAR LITTLE FACE IN THE TRUNDLE BED AND HE SAID WITH A DECIDED NOD I'LL GIVE NANNY THE CHANCE
WHICH MADE THEM FORGET EVERY TROUBLE THEY HAD EVER KNOWN NEXT DAY THE KIND MAN CAME TO GIVE NANNY HER CHANCE SHE HAD NO DOUBT AND VERY LITTLE FEAR
WHEN JACK ENDED THE DOCTOR SAT NANNY ON HIS KNEE GENTLY LIFTED UP THE HALF SHUT EYELIDS AND AFTER EXAMINING THE FILM A MINUTE STROKED HER PRETTY HAIR AND
BOTH IN MOTHERS AND NURSERY MAIDS BY THE RIGHT SHOULDER BEING LARGER AND MORE ELEVATED THAN THE LEFT THE HABITS OF THE SEAMSTRESS ARE INDICATED BY THE NECK SUDDENLY BENDING FORWARD
SUCH INDICATIONS ARE AFFORDED BY THE WALK TO EVERY CAREFUL OBSERVER IN CONSIDERING THE PROPORTION OF THE LIMBS TO THE BODY IF EVEN IN A YOUNG WOMAN THE WALK THOUGH OTHERWISE GOOD BE HEAVY
AS TO FIGURE A CERTAIN SYMMETRY OR DISPROPORTION OF PARTS EITHER OF WHICH DEPENDS IMMEDIATELY UPON THE LOCOMOTIVE SYSTEM OR A CERTAIN SOFTNESS OR HARDNESS OF FORM
AND THE HEEL BE SEEN AT EACH STEP TO LIFT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRESS UPWARD AND BACKWARD NEITHER THE HIP NOR THE CALF IS WELL DEVELOPED
THE FEAR OF THIS NEARLY BROKE JACK'S HEART AND HE WENT ABOUT WITH SUCH AN ANXIOUS FACE THAT IT WAS A MERCY NANNY DID NOT SEE IT JACK WAS ONLY TWELVE
THOSE WHO HAVE THE HAUNCHES TOO NARROW TAKE CARE NOT TO HAVE THE BOTTOM OF THE DRESS TOO WIDE TALL WOMEN HAVE A WIDE SKIRT OR SEVERAL FLOUNCES OR BOTH OF THESE
THE GAIT HOWEVER IS OFTEN FORMED IN A GREAT MEASURE BY LOCAL OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE OBSERVER SHOULD AVOID BEING MISLED DRESS AS AFFORDING INDICATIONS
I WONDER THAT YOUR CONSCIENCE ALLOWS YOU TO SHIRK YOUR PART OF THE DUTY AND LEAVE ALL THE TIRESOME ENTERTAINING TO BE DONE BY ME SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH WIDE OPENED EYES AND A CONCERNED FACE
I MUST HAVE WALKED TOO FAR I DON'T LIKE IT THOUGH I MUST SEE A DOCTOR I MUST CERTAINLY SEE A DOCTOR ALICE BENT OVER HIM FULL OF SYMPATHY AND HE TOOK HER ARM I WALKED BEHIND HIM IN SILENCE
IN LOVE WITH HER HUSBAND BUT A WOMAN OF THE WORLD MANNERS AS FINE AS MISSUS MC LANE'S BUT TOO ALOOF AND SENSITIVE TO CARE FOR LEADERSHIP SHE HAD MADE THE GRAND TOUR IN EUROPE THEY DISCOVERED
WINDING UP WITH AN HOUR AND A HALF OF LADY NASELTON ONE GETS SO TIRED OF ONE'S OWN SEX NOT A SINGLE MAN ALL THE AFTERNOON SOMEBODY ELSE'S HUSBAND TO PASS THE BREAD AND BUTTER WOULD HAVE BEEN A GODSEND
I STROLLED UP AND DOWN THE DRIVE THIS RESTLESSNESS WAS ONE OF MY GREATEST TROUBLES WHEN THE FIT CAME I COULD NEITHER WORK NOR READ NOR THINK CONNECTEDLY IT WAS A PHASE OF INCIPIENT DISSATISFACTION WITH LIFE
THE OLDER WOMEN WORE SMALL BONNETS AND CASHMERE SHAWLS LACE COLLARS AND CAMEOS
I TURNED ROUND WITH A TERRIFIED START ALMOST AT MY SIDE SOME HEAVY BODY HAD FALLEN TO THE GROUND WITH A FAINT GROAN A SINGLE STEP AND I WAS BENDING OVER THE PROSTRATE FORM OF A MAN
SHE TOOK NO NOURISHMENT BUT MILK AND BROTH AND SPOKE TO NO ONE TODAY THIS WOULD BE A REST CURE AND WAS EQUALLY BENEFICIAL WHEN THE ATTACK WAS OVER MISSUS MC LANE WOULD ARISE WITH A CLEAR COMPLEXION
AGAINST THE GREY SKY HE WAS LASHING THE THISTLES BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH HIS LONG WHIP MAYBE HE GROWLED
BUT MISSUS ABBOTT A LADY OF THREE CHINS AND AN EAGLE EYE WHO HAD CLUNG FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO BLACK SATIN AND BUGLES WAS TOO PERSISTENT TO BE DENIED
SHE EXCLAIMED I WAS IN AN EVIL MOOD AND I DETERMINED TO SHOCK HER IT WAS NEVER A DIFFICULT TASK SO I DO SOMETIMES I ANSWERED BUT TO DAY MY CALLERS HAVE BEEN ALL WOMEN
HE HAD BEEN STRICKEN WITH A SUDDEN TERROR WHOSE WAS THE VOICE WHENCE HIS FEAR OF IT I WATCHED HIM LEANING SLIGHTLY UPON ALICE'S ARM AND WALKING ON SLOWLY IN FRONT OF ME TOWARDS THE HOUSE
SHE WAS SWEET AND GRACIOUS BUT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOT A HINT OF EMBARRASSMENT SHE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SHINE AND THEY LIKED HER THE BETTER FOR THAT THE YOUNG MEN SOON DISCOVERED THEY COULD MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON THIS LOVELY IMPORTATION
PRESENTLY HE OPENED HIS EYES AND RAISED HIS HEAD A LITTLE LOOKING HALF FEARFULLY AROUND IT WAS HER VOICE HE WHISPERED HOARSELY IT CAME TO ME THROUGH THE SHADOWS WHERE IS SHE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HER
INDUCED BY AN INGENUOUS COMPOUND OF AMAZEMENT DISAPPOINTMENT AND ADMIRATION THEY HAD BEEN PREPARED TO FORGIVE TO ENDURE TO MAKE EVERY ALLOWANCE
HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN ME TO CATCH COLD THROUGH WEARING THIN CLOTHES OR GOING WITHOUT A HAT I ASKED I AM TIRED OF BEING INDOORS THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE HERE ALL THE AFTERNOON
OUT UPON THE MOIST AIR HIS GREAT FIGURE LOOMING UNNATURALLY LARGE THROUGH THE MISTY TWILIGHT WAS THE LAST TO VANISH IT WAS MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF MISTER BRUCE DEVILLE OF DEVILLE COURT
I HELD OUT MY ARM AND HE STAGGERED UP HE WAS STILL WHITE AND SHAKEN BUT EVIDENTLY HIS MEMORY WAS RETURNING I REMEMBER IT WAS CLOSE IN THE STUDY HE SAID VERY CLOSE I WAS TIRED TOO
I CAUGHT HIS HAND AND GAZED INTO HIS FACE WITH HORRIFIED EYES IT WAS MY FATHER HE MUST HAVE BEEN WITHIN A YARD OF ME WHEN HE FELL HIS EYES WERE HALF CLOSED AND HIS HANDS WERE COLD
I FANCY I HEARD THAT ONE WAS EXPECTED A SULLEN IMPATIENT GROWL CAME FROM HER SIDE
IF HE DID NOT OCCUPY HIMSELF LUCRATIVELY WAS UNFIT FOR THE SOCIETY OF ENTERPRISING CITIZENS FEW HAD COME IN TIME FOR THE GOLD DIGGINGS BUT ALL
CLASPED AT THE BASE BY A STRING OF PEARLS ON HER HEAD AS PROUDLY POISED AS MISSUS MC LANE'S WAS A BLUE VELVET HAT HIGHER IN THE CROWN THAN THE PREVAILING FASHION
I LOOKED AFTER HER AND SIGHED
AND THE LOW MANTEL PIECE MISSUS MC LANE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE BEAUTY WITH THE AID OF THE SAN FRANCISCO SHOPS BUT AT LEAST SHE HAD MANAGED TO GIVE HER ROOMS A SEVERE AND STATELY SIMPLICITY
LIFTED THE EYEBROWS TO WHICH SONNETS HAD BEEN WRITTEN WITH AN AIR OF HAUGHTY RESIGNATION BUT MADE UP HER MIND TO ABATE HER SCORN OF THE NORTH AND ORDER HER GOWNS FROM NEW YORK HEREAFTER BUT THE SAN FRANCISCANS
THERE IS NOTHING SERIOUS THE MATTER AT LEAST I THINK NOT I WHISPERED TO ALICE IT IS ONLY A FAINTING FIT I RUBBED HIS HANDS AND WE FORCED SOME BRANDY BETWEEN HIS LIPS
COME BACK INTO THE HOUSE WITH ME I LAUGHED AT HER IN CONTEMPT THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE INDEED BETWEEN MY MUSLIN GOWN AND THE PLAIN BLACK SKIRT AND JACKET POWDERED WITH DUST WHICH WAS ALICE'S USUAL COSTUME
BUT THEY FOUND NOTHING TO DEPLORE BUT THE AGONIZING NECESSITY FOR IMMEDIATE READJUSTMENT MISSUS TALBOT WAS UNQUESTIONABLY A PRODUCT OF THE BEST SOCIETY THE SOUTH COULD HAVE DONE NO BETTER
THE MAN WAS NEAREST TO ME AND I COULD SEE HIM MORE DISTINCTLY HE WAS TALL AND VERY BROAD WITH A RAGGED BEARD AND LONG HAIR HE WORE NO COLLAR AND THERE WAS A GREAT RENT IN HIS SHABBY SHOOTING COAT
THE DELAY OF DRESSING WAS MORE THAN I HAD PATIENCE TO ENCOUNTER UNLESS I WAS COMPLETELY MISTAKEN HERE WAS THE VERY PERSON WHOM I WANTED TO ENLIGHTEN ME GLOODY SHOWED HIMSELF AT THE DOOR
THE MAGISTRATE WOULD PUT QUESTIONS TO ME WOULDN'T HE SIR VERY GOOD YOU PUT QUESTIONS TO ME AND I'LL ANSWER THEM TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
WAS SURVEYING WITH THE COLD CURIOSITY OF AN INTELLIGENCE EMPTY OF HUMAN EMOTION THE DESTRUCTION OF ONE OF THOSE FABRICS WHOSE UNEQUAL CONTESTS AND REPEATED TRIUMPHS HAD PROVOKED ITS HAUGHTY SURPRISE
MY CLOTHES WEIGHED UPON ME LIKE A SUIT OF ARMOUR SO INFLEXIBLY HARD WERE THEY FROZEN YET I GOT UPON MY LEGS AND FOUND THAT I COULD STAND AND WALK AND THAT LIFE FLOWED WARM IN MY VEINS
THE INVESTIGATION THAT FOLLOWED WAS FAR TOO LONG AND TOO WEARISOME TO BE RELATED HERE IF I GIVE THE SUBSTANCE OF IT I SHALL HAVE DONE ENOUGH SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS AWAKE AND SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS ALONE SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP AND DREAMING
I TOOK FROM THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN A STOUT CLOAK AND THREW IT OVER ME ENVELOPING MY HEAD WHICH I HAD CASED IN A WARM FUR CAP WITH THE HOOD OF IT AND THUS EQUIPPED I LIGHTED A SMALL HAND LANTERN THAT WAS USED ON DARK NIGHTS FOR HEAVING THE LOG
HER CASE MIGHT NOT BE SO DESPERATE AS WAS THREATENED BY THE WAY IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN TORN AND PRECIPITATED PAST THE ICEBERG AT MOMENTS WHEN SHE PLUNGED THE WHITENESS OF THE WATER CREAMING UPON THE SURGES ON EITHER HAND
IT WAS WONDERFUL HOWEVER THAT SHE SHOULD STILL BE AFLOAT NO MAN COULD HAVE HEARD THE RENDING AND GRATING OF HER SIDE AGAINST THE ICE WITHOUT SUPPOSING THAT EVERY PLANK IN IT WAS BEING TORN OUT
BUT I NOW NOTICED THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE HAMPER BEING ON THE LARBOARD SIDE BALANCED THE LIST THE VESSEL TOOK FROM HER SHIFTED BALLAST AND THAT SHE FLOATED ON A LEVEL KEEL WITH HER BOWS FAIR AT THE SEA
TILL ALL THAT QUARTER OF THE SEA LOOKED TO BE A MASS OF LEAPING DAZZLE UPON THE EASTERN SEA LINE LAY A RANGE OF WHITE CLOUDS COMPACT AS THE CHALK CLIFFS OF DOVER
REASSERTED ITSELF AND MAYBE I ALSO GOT SOME SLENDER COMFORT FROM OBSERVING THAT DULL AND HEAVY AS WAS THE MOTION OF THE BRIG THERE WAS YET THE BUOYANCY OF VITALITY IN HER MANNER OF MOUNTING THE SEAS AND THAT AFTER ALL
HAD WE ANY PROOF TO JUSTIFY US GLOODY AT ONCE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE HAD NO PROOF I HAPPENED TO LOOK AT THE BOAT HE SAID AND I MISSED THE OARS OH YES I SEARCHED THE BOAT HOUSE NO OARS NO OARS
HEAVING VERY SLOWLY THOUGH YOU FELT THE WEIGHT OF THE MIGHTY OCEAN IN EVERY FOLD AND EASTWARDS THE SHOULDERS OF THE SWELL CATCHING THE GLORIOUS REFLECTION OF THE SUN HURLED THE SPLENDOUR ALONG
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ANOTHER TON OF WATER WOULD SINK HER AND IF THE SWELL FELL OVER HER BOWS AND FILLED THE DECKS DOWN SHE WOULD GO I HAD A SMALL PARCEL OF GUINEAS IN MY CHEST AND WAS ABOUT TO FETCH THIS MONEY
I TOOK DOWN THE LAMP TRIMMED IT AND WENT TO THE LAZARETTE HATCH AT THE AFTER END OF THE CABIN HERE WERE KEPT THE STORES FOR THE CREW
THE BRIG PITCHED AND ROLLED HEAVILY MUCH OF THE BUOYANCY OF HER EARLIER DANCE WAS GONE OUT OF HER NEVERTHELESS I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THIS SLUGGISHNESS WAS ALTOGETHER DUE TO THE WATER SHE HAD TAKEN IN
I RAN TO THE CABIN BUT THE LAZARETTE WAS FULL OF WATER AND NONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN IT TO BE COME AT I THEREUPON RANSACKED THE CABIN AND FOUND A WHOLE DUTCH CHEESE A PIECE OF RAW PORK HALF A HAM
IT WAS AS SILENT AS A PHANTOM AND WITH ARCHED NECK AND MOTIONLESS PLUMES SEEMED TO WATCH ME WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT PRESENTLY GREW INSUFFERABLE SO FAR FROM FINDING ANY COMFORT OF COMPANIONSHIP IN THE CREATURE
HAD FLOATED THE JOLLY BOAT OUT OF THE LONG BOAT AND SWEPT IT BOTTOM UP TO THE GANGWAY WHERE IT LAY AS THOUGH GOD'S MERCY DESIGNED IT SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR MY USE FOR NOT LONG AFTER IT HAD BEEN FLOATED OUT THE BRIG STRUCK THE BERG THE MASTS FELL
IN THIS DIFFICULTY HE CAME BACK TO MY BEDSIDE LOOK HERE SIR WHAT I SAY IS THAT KICK HAS WIPED OUT THE DEBT OF THANKS I OWE HIM YES I SAY THE ACCOUNT BETWEEN US TWO IS SETTLED NOW ON BOTH SIDES
THAN BY SAILING INTO THE GREAT DESOLATION OF THE NORTH WEST THE BURDEN OF MY LONELINESS WEIGHED DOWN UPON ME SO CRUSHINGLY THAT I CANNOT BUT CONSIDER MY SENSES MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT DULLED BY SUFFERING
EVEN ONE ONLY TO MAKE ME AN ECHO FOR MINE OWN SPEECH NAY GOD HIMSELF THE MERCIFUL FATHER OF ALL EVEN HE SEEMED NOT THE BLACKNESS LAY LIKE A PALL UPON THE DEEP AND UPON MY SOUL
AND AS IF THAT HAD NOT SUFFICED TO SLAY HIM THE FALL OF THE MASTS HAD IN SOME WONDERFUL MANNER WHIPPED A ROPE SEVERAL TIMES ROUND HIS BODY BINDING HIS ARMS AND ENCIRCLING HIS THROAT SO TIGHTLY
I'M DISMISSED FROM MY MASTER'S SERVICE THAT'S ALL IT WAS PLAINLY NOT ALL RELIEVED EVEN BY THAT GUARDED REPLY I POINTED TO A CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I MEAN WELL BY YOU I ASKED
FOR THEY LAY UNDER A WHOLE BODY OF SHROUDS COMPLICATED BY A MASS OF OTHER GEAR AGAINST WHICH LEANED A PORTION OF THE CABOOSE I VIEWED THEM LONG ENOUGH TO SATISFY MY MIND THAT THEY WERE DEAD AND THEN WITH A HEART OF LEAD TURNED AWAY
SHOT WITH PEARLY LUSTRE FLOATED OVERHEAD VERY HIGH IT WAS IN TRUTH A FAIR AND PLEASANT MORNING OF AN ICY COLDNESS INDEED BUT THE AIR BEING DRY ITS SHREWDNESS WAS ENDURABLE
NEVERTHELESS ITS RAYS SUFFERED ME TO GUESS AT THE PICTURE OF RUIN THE DECKS OFFERED THE MAIN MAST WAS SNAPPED THREE OR FOUR FEET ABOVE THE DECK AND THE STUMP OF IT SHOWED AS JAGGED AND BARBED AS A WILD BEAST'S TEETH
THEY WOULD EVEN SAY SOMETIMES THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HEAR HER OWN PRAISES FOR FEAR IT SHOULD MAKE HER VAIN AND THEN WHISPER THEM BEHIND THEIR HANDS BUT SO LOUD THAT SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO HEAR EVERY WORD THE CONSEQUENCE WAS
THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH AN ABSENCE NOW AND THEN AND WERE NOT AT FIRST FRIGHTENED BUT WHEN IT GREW DARK AND SHE DID NOT APPEAR THE HUSBAND SET OUT WITH HIS DOGS IN ONE DIRECTION AND THE WIFE IN ANOTHER TO SEEK THEIR CHILD
WHEN HE TOOK HIS HALF HE GAVE THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN THE BANANAS WHICH GROW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BUNCH AND ARE SMALL AND WRINKLED THE NICE BIG FAT ONES HE KEPT FOR HIMSELF AND CARRIED THEM HOME TO LET THEM RIPEN IN THE DARK
SHE PLAYED WITH THE TOYS HER FATHER MADE HER AND THOUGHT THEM THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS IN THE WORLD WINDMILLS AND LITTLE CROOKS AND WATER WHEELS AND SOMETIMES LAMBS MADE ALL OF WOOL AND DOLLS MADE OUT OF THE LEG BONES OF SHEEP WHICH HER MOTHER DRESSED FOR HER
THE MONKEY CALLED OUT LET GO MY HAND AND GIVE ME A BANANA OR ELSE I'LL GIVE YOU A HARD HARD BLOW WITH MY OTHER HAND THE IMAGE OF WAX DID NOT LET GO THE MONKEY GAVE THE IMAGE A HARD HARD BLOW WITH HIS OTHER HAND
AND A DOUBLE VERTICAL WRINKLE SETTLED OVER HER NOSE THE WISE WOMAN SAW IT FOR ALL HER BUSINESS WAS WITH AGNES THOUGH SHE LITTLE KNEW IT AND RISING WENT AND OFFERED THE CUP TO THE CHILD WHERE SHE SAT WITH HER KNITTING IN A CORNER
THE MONKEY WAS PLAYING HIS GUITAR
HOW THE MONKEY ESCAPED BEING EATEN ONCE UPON A TIME
THE WISE WOMAN LOOKED AT THE MOTHER YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE OFFERED IT TO HER IF YOU DID NOT MEAN HER TO HAVE IT SAID THE MOTHER SIDING WITH THE DEVIL IN HER CHILD AGAINST THE WISE WOMAN AND HER CHILD TOO SOME FOOLISH PEOPLE THINK THEY TAKE ANOTHER'S PART
BEGGED HIM TO DANCE SOME MORE IF YOU WILL OPEN THE DOOR A LITTLE BIT SO THAT I CAN HAVE MORE AIR TO BREATHE I'LL SHOW YOU A NEW DANCE SAID THE MONKEY THE CHILDREN OPENED THE DOOR
TILL SHE HAD FINISHED IT THEN LOOKING INTO THE EMPTY CUP SAID YOU MIGHT HAVE GIVEN ME BACK AS MUCH AS YOU HAD NO CLAIM UPON AGNES TURNED AWAY AND MADE NO ANSWER FAR LESS FROM SHAME THAN INDIGNATION
DARE TO TELL HIM THAT THE MONKEY HAD ESCAPED THEY LET HIM THINK THAT THE STICKS AND THE COCOANUT SHELL IN THE POT WAS THE MONKEY
EVERY TIME THE MAN HEARD THE MONKEY PLAY THE GUITAR HE WOULD COME NEAR AND TRY TO CATCH HIM THE MONKEY GREW AFRAID OF THE MAN SO AFRAID THAT HE GAVE UP PLAYING HIS GUITAR AT ALL
WHEN HE GOT THROUGH PLAYING HE STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE GROUND THERE WAS THE MAN WAITING FOR HIM HE CRAWLED QUICKLY BACK
DID NOT LET GO THEN THE MONKEY MADE SUCH AN UPROAR WITH HIS CRIES AND SHOUTS THAT VERY SOON MONKEYS CAME RUNNING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS THERE WERE BIG MONKEYS AND LITTLE MONKEYS AND MIDDLE SIZED MONKEYS
SOME OF THE BEASTS WERE GOOD TO EAT AND OTHERS WERE NOT GOOD AT ALL THE OX WAS FOUND TO BE VERY GOOD
VERY IMAGE OF HER OWN AND SHE LOOKED SO SIMPERING AND MAWKISH AND SELF CONSCIOUS AND SILLY THAT SHE MADE THE WISE WOMAN FEEL RATHER SICK NOT THAT THE CHILD WAS A FOOL
THE NEW BODY THAT WAS GROWING INSIDE OF IT AND WOULD COME OUT OF IT WHEN SHE DIED WOULD BE UGLY AND CROOKED THIS WAY AND THAT LIKE AN AGED HAWTHORN THAT HAS LIVED HUNDREDS OF YEARS EXPOSED UPON ALL SIDES TO SALT SEA WINDS
LET GO MY FOOT LET GO MY TWO HANDS AND MY FOOT
OR AMONGST THE HEATHER WHERE THE BEES WERE BUSY OR SHE WOULD WANDER AWAY AMONGST THE HILLS AND BE NOBODY KNEW WHERE SOMETIMES FROM MORNING TO NIGHT NOR DID HER PARENTS VENTURE TO FIND FAULT WITH HER SHE NEVER WENT INTO RAGES LIKE THE PRINCESS
UNTIL AT LENGTH ALL GAVE UP THE SEARCH IN DESPAIR EXCEPT THE MOTHER ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NEARLY CONVINCED NOW THAT THE POOR WOMAN HAD CARRIED HER OFF ONE DAY
AS TIME WENT ON THIS DISEASE OF SELF CONCEIT WENT ON TOO GRADUALLY DEVOURING THE GOOD THAT WAS IN HER FOR THERE IS NO FAULT THAT DOES NOT BRING ITS BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND COUSINS TO LIVE WITH IT
AT LAST HE WAS FREE WHEN THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED
ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE WORLD HAD JUST BEEN MADE AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE KIND OF BANANA BUT VERY MANY KINDS OF MONKEYS THERE WAS A LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD A BIG GARDEN FULL OF BANANA TREES
AND SO THEY RUN ABOUT FOREVER LOOKING FOR THEIR OWN SHADOWS THAT THEY MAY WORSHIP THEM AND MISERABLE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT FIND THEM BEING THEMSELVES TOO NEAR THE GROUND TO HAVE ANY SHADOWS AND WHAT BECOMES OF THEM AT LAST THERE IS BUT ONE WHO KNOWS
THEN LAY THEIR FACES ON THE GROUND TILL THEY GROW INTO SNOUTS WHEN AT LAST THEY ARE A HIDEOUS SORT OF LIZARDS EACH OF WHICH BELIEVES HIMSELF THE BEST WISEST AND LOVELIEST BEING IN THE WORLD YEA THE VERY CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE
ALTHOUGH THEY WERE MANY SHE COULD ONLY PLAY WITH ONE AT A TIME AND THAT INDEED TROUBLED HER A LITTLE OR LIVE LAMBS THAT WERE NOT ALL WOOL OR THE SHEEP DOGS WHICH WERE VERY FRIENDLY WITH HER AND THE BEST OF PLAYFELLOWS AS SHE THOUGHT FOR SHE HAD NO HUMAN ONES TO COMPARE THEM WITH
AND RIDE AWAY IN TRIUMPH ON THE BACK OF A DEVIL IS ONE OF THE POOREST SO LONG AS SHE WAS LEFT TO TAKE HER OWN WAY AND DO AS SHE WOULD SHE GAVE HER PARENTS LITTLE TROUBLE SHE WOULD PLAY ABOUT BY HERSELF IN THE LITTLE GARDEN WITH ITS FEW HARDY FLOWERS
THE IMAGE OF WAX DID NOT LET GO THEN THE MONKEY
THE WISE WOMAN HAD HER EYE UPON HER SHE SAW THAT SOMETHING SPECIAL MUST BE DONE ELSE SHE WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE WHO KNEEL TO THEIR OWN SHADOWS TILL FEET GROW ON THEIR KNEES THEN GO DOWN ON THEIR HANDS TILL THEIR HANDS GROW INTO FEET
THIS MORNING HE WAS FEELING VERY GOOD NATURED
THE IMAGE OF WAX ANSWERED NEVER A WORD AGAIN THE MONKEY SAID THIS TIME IN A LITTLE LOUDER VOICE O PEDDLER BOY PEDDLER BOY PLEASE GIVE ME A BANANA JUST ONE LITTLE RIPE LITTLE
HE FELT THE SHOCK OF A VIGOROUS HAND SEIZING HIM AND THE SWOON IN WHICH HIS SENSES VANISHED HARDLY ALLOWED HIM TIME FOR THE THOUGHT MINGLED WITH A LAST MEMORY OF COSETTE I AM TAKEN PRISONER I SHALL BE SHOT
THAT THE EXCOMMUNICATION WAS UNJUST AND THAT BEING UNJUST IT WAS NOT VALID ONLY MADE THEM TREMBLE THE MORE AS A DEFIANCE CAST AT A MYSTIC IMAGE
BALDASSARRE WAS EVIDENTLY HELPLESS THE THING TO BE FEARED WAS NOT THAT HE SHOULD INJURE TITO BUT THAT TITO COMING UPON HIS TRACES SHOULD CARRY OUT SOME NEW SCHEME FOR RIDDING HIMSELF OF THE INJURED MAN WHO WAS A HAUNTING DREAD TO HIM
HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT HE COULD MAKE HIMSELF NO ANSWER EXCEPT THAT THE MAN RESEMBLED SOME ONE OF WHOM HIS MEMORY PRESERVED A CONFUSED TRACE HOWEVER APART FROM THE IDENTITY WHICH HE COULD NOT MANAGE TO CATCH BOULATRUELLE
IT REQUIRED A GOOD QUARTER OF AN HOUR IN A BEE LINE THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH WHICH IS PECULIARLY DENSE VERY THORNY AND VERY AGGRESSIVE IN THAT LOCALITY A FULL HALF HOUR WAS NECESSARY BOULATRUELLE COMMITTED THE ERROR
AND SHIELDING THEM WITH HIS BODY AND FACING AN ENTIRE BATTALION ALONE HE MADE THEM PASS IN BEHIND HIM ALL PRECIPITATED THEMSELVES THITHER ENJOLRAS EXECUTING WITH HIS RIFLE WHICH HE NOW USED LIKE A CANE
WHERE THE LITTLE PAINTED TABERNACLE WAS AND WHERE SHE WAS THEN SITTING SO THAT SHE MIGHT BE AWAY FROM THE NOISE OF STRANGE FOOTSTEPS ROMOLA ASSENTED QUIETLY
WITH A COBBLER'S SHOULDER STICK OF FIRE
SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND FIRST THE GREAT BELL WAS SOUNDED
HE SPENT THE INTERVALS OF BUSINESS CHIEFLY IN THE COUNTRY
THE HEAP OF STONES DESTINED FOR NO ONE KNOWS WHAT EMPLOYMENT
OR A MAN WHO HAD BEEN ROBBED AN ORDER OF NOLLE PROSEQUI
MADE HER SHRINK FROM TITO WITH A HORROR WHICH WOULD PERHAPS HAVE URGED SOME PASSIONATE SPEECH IN SPITE OF HERSELF IF HE HAD NOT BEEN MORE THAN USUALLY ABSENT FROM HOME LIKE MANY OF THE WEALTHIER CITIZENS IN THAT TIME OF PESTILENCE
AND AS ONE KNOTS ONE THREAD TO ANOTHER THREAD
ON SCRUTINIZING THE SOLITARY WASTE ON THE SIDE WHERE THE FOREST IS THOROUGHLY ENTANGLED AND WILD BOULATRUELLE SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS MAN HARDLY HAD HE GOT HIS EYE UPON HIM WHEN HE LOST SIGHT OF HIM
BROKEN AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE NATIONAL GUARD AND THE MUNICIPAL GUARD ON FOOT AND SUPPORTED BY SERRIED MASSES WHICH COULD BE HEARD THOUGH NOT SEEN
HE WAS RAPIDLY PASSING IN HIS DAILY SERMONS FROM THE GENERAL TO THE SPECIAL FROM TELLING HIS HEARERS THAT THEY MUST POSTPONE THEIR PRIVATE PASSIONS AND INTERESTS TO THE PUBLIC GOOD
HE HAD NO PRIVATE MALICE HE SOUGHT NO PETTY GRATIFICATION
THEY BROUGHT NO SIGN FROM BALDASSARRE AND IN SPITE OF SPECIAL WATCH ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT NO REVELATION OF THE SUSPECTED CONSPIRACY
AND WITH KICKS SHOUTING CALLING ENTREATING WRINGING THEIR HANDS NO ONE OPENED FROM THE LITTLE WINDOW ON THE THIRD FLOOR THE HEAD OF THE DEAD MAN GAZED DOWN UPON THEM BUT ENJOLRAS AND MARIUS
ONE WOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED HIM A PHANTOM ENGAGED IN FIRING A GUN THE INSURGENTS CARTRIDGES WERE GIVING OUT BUT NOT THEIR SARCASMS IN THIS WHIRLWIND OF THE SEPULCHRE IN WHICH THEY STOOD THEY LAUGHED
FELT HER RELATION TO THE CHURCH ONLY THROUGH SAVONAROLA HIS MORAL FORCE HAD BEEN THE ONLY AUTHORITY TO WHICH SHE HAD BOWED AND IN HIS EXCOMMUNICATION SHE ONLY SAW THE MENACE OF HOSTILE VICE ON ONE SIDE SHE SAW A MAN
WAS ON THIS OCCASION GUILTY OF THE FAULT OF GOING STRAIGHT HE FLUNG HIMSELF RESOLUTELY INTO THE TANGLE OF UNDERGROWTH HE HAD TO DEAL WITH HOLLY BUSHES NETTLES HAWTHORNS EGLANTINES THISTLES
AS THERE WOULD BE AGENTS COMING TO PACK UP THE ANTIQUITIES THEN LEANING TO KISS HER ON THE BROW
WHY WAS HE IN THESE WOODS
AND THE DOOR OF THAT HOUSE SUDDENLY OPENED A CRACK AND CLOSED AGAIN INSTANTLY WAS LIFE FOR THESE DESPAIRING MEN BEHIND THIS HOUSE THERE WERE STREETS POSSIBLE FLIGHT SPACE THEY SET TO KNOCKING AT THAT DOOR WITH THE BUTTS OF THEIR GUNS
AND OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN AND HELD THE SCALING PARTY IN CHECK WITH THESE FRIGHTFULLY FRAGILE CLUBS
WHEN THEY WERE EXHAUSTED WHEN THESE FORMIDABLE MEN ON THE POINT OF DEATH HAD NO LONGER EITHER POWDER OR BALL
WHERE ALL THE OFFICERS OF GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE ELECTED
THAT FORCE WAS THE PREACHING OF SAVONAROLA IMPELLED PARTLY BY THE SPIRITUAL NECESSITY THAT WAS LAID UPON HIM TO GUIDE THE PEOPLE AND PARTLY BY THE PROMPTING OF PUBLIC MEN WHO COULD GET NO MEASURES CARRIED WITHOUT HIS AID
AND THE PURER THE GOVERNMENT OF FLORENCE WOULD BECOME THE MORE SECURE FROM THE DESIGNS OF MEN WHO SAW THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE IN THE MORAL DEBASEMENT OF THEIR FELLOWS THE NEARER WOULD THE FLORENTINE PEOPLE APPROACH THE CHARACTER OF A PURE COMMUNITY
FROM ITS CLUSTERS OF LIGHTNING THE BARRICADE WAS UNDERNEATH IT ON BOTH SIDES THE RESOLUTION WAS EQUAL THE BRAVERY EXHIBITED THERE WAS ALMOST BARBAROUS AND WAS COMPLICATED WITH A SORT OF HEROIC FEROCITY
AS ITS POINT OF APPARENT ORIGIN AND SINCE THAT MOMENT IN THE PIAZZA DEL DUOMO WHEN TITO MOUNTED ON THE BALES HAD TASTED A KEEN PLEASURE IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS ABILITY TO TICKLE THE EARS OF MEN WITH ANY PHRASES THAT PLEASED THEM
BENEATH THE BLACK CLOTH TWO STRAIGHT AND RIGID FORMS WERE VISIBLE
IN WHICH THE HEREDITARY INFLUENCE OF GOOD FAMILIES WOULD BE LESS ADULTERATED WITH THE VOTES OF SHOPKEEPERS DOCTORS OF LAW DISPUTED DAY AFTER DAY AND FAR ON INTO THE NIGHT
AN AILING CHESTNUT TREE BANDAGED WITH A SHEET OF ZINC NAILED DIRECTLY UPON THE BARK
WHO HAD BUT A FEW MORE ROUNDS TO FIRE WHO WERE FUMBLING IN THEIR POCKETS WHICH HAD BEEN EMPTIED OF CARTRIDGES NEARLY ALL OF WHOM WERE WOUNDED WITH HEAD OR ARM BANDAGED WITH BLACK AND BLOOD STAINED LINEN WITH HOLES IN THEIR CLOTHES FROM WHICH THE BLOOD TRICKLED
WHICH THEY TOGETHER HAD ASCENDED ONCE WHEN THE SUN OF THEIR HOPE WAS STILL HIGH SHE DID NOT MEET HIM AGAIN THAT DAY SHE AND HONORA ATE THEIR MEALS IN SILENCE HONORA DARK WITH DISAPPROVAL
THINK WHAT SUCH A BRAIN AND HEART AS YOURS WOULD MEAN TO A NEW CAUSE WE'D LOSE OURSELVES AND FIND OURSELVES LABORING FOR ONE OF THE KINDEST LOVINGEST IDEAS THE HARD OLD WORLD HAS YET DEVISED WILL YOU COME AND HELP ME KARL
THE SUN COMES DOWN EACH EVENING IN ITS LOVELY VALES TO REST AND THOUGH FAR AND DIM ON THE OCEAN'S RIM IT SEEMS TO MORTAL VIEW WE SHALL REACH ITS HALLS ERE THE EVENING FALLS IN MY STRONG AND SWIFT CANOE
AND HOW HE PUT THEM DOWN IN ARGUMENT THE PAGAN IRISH HAD MANY GODS AND MANY IDOLS AMONG OTHER THINGS THEY WORSHIPPED THE FAIRIES WHO WERE AND ARE STILL CALLED IN IRISH SHEE
THAT I CANNOT LET YOU GO EVEN THOUGH YOU GO ON TO GREAT USEFULNESS AND GREAT GOODNESS I TELL YOU YOUR PLACE IS HERE IN MY HOME IT IS SAFE HERE
SOME HARMLESS SOME MALIGNANT WHO WILL BE FOUND ENUMERATED AND DESCRIBED IN EITHER OF MY TWO SOCIAL HISTORIES THE IDOLS WORSHIPPED BY THE PAGAN IRISH WERE NEARLY ALL OF THEM STONES MOSTLY PILLAR STONES
NESTLING AGAINST HER DARK ONE AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM MOVING UNSEEINGLY SHE HEARD THE HARD WRUNG GROAN THAT CAME FROM HIS LIPS A MOMENT LATER AS SHE MOUNTED THE STAIRS SHE SAW HIM STRIDING UP THE TRAIL
FACING A TASK TOO LARGE FOR HER NEEDING THE COMFORT OF HER LOVER'S WORD SHE STRETCHED HERSELF UPON THE SAND FACE DOWNWARD WEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID OF LIFE
PACIFIC THUNDERED IN UPON THEM THEY COULD HEAR THE WINDS CALLING AND CALLING WITH AN IMMEMORIAL INVITATION THEY KNEW OF THE LITTLE JEWELLED ISLANDS THAT LAY OUT IN THE SEAS AND OF THE LANDS OF ELD ON THE FAR FAR SHORE
BUT FOR THE IDEA I REPRESENT AND THE WORK I MEAN TO DO THEY WOULD BE TRAMPLED IN THE DUST OF THE WORLD CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I AM CALLED TO THIS AS MEN ARE CALLED TO HONORABLE SERVICES FOR THEIR COUNTRY
THEY COULD RAISE A DRUIDICAL OR MAGIC FOG WHICH HID THINGS FROM VIEW OR BRING ON DARKNESS IN THE DAY LIKE THE BLACKEST NIGHT THEY COULD BRING DOWN SHOWERS OF FIRE OR BLOOD CAUSE A SNOWFALL EVEN IN SUMMER
TILL THE GROUND WAS COVERED HALF A YARD DEEP AND BRING ON STORMS AND TEMPESTS ON SEA OR LAND THEY COULD DRIVE A MAN MAD BY THEIR SORCERY A POWER WHICH WAS DREADED MOST OF ALL BY THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL
I WARNED YOU OF ITS DANGER YOU TOLD ME OF ITS GLORY BUT I REPEAT MY WARNING NOW FOR I SEE YOU VENTURING ON TO THAT PRECIPICE OF LONELINESS AND FAME ON WHICH NONE BUT SAD AND LONELY WOMEN STAND
TELL IT BELOVED SHE KISSED HIS BROW AND HIS EYES HE FELT HER TEARS UPON HIS CHEEKS YOU KNOW ALL THAT I HAVE THOUGHT AND FELT SHE SAID
YOU SAY I AM DEAR TO YOU TRANSFER YOUR INTERESTS AND COME WITH ME KARL HER VOICE WAS A PLEADER'S YET IT KEPT ITS PRIDE
HE TOOK BOTH WOMEN WITH A PROTECTING GESTURE INTO HIS EMBRACE THE THREE REJOICED TOGETHER IN THAT HONEST DEMONSTRATION WHICH SEEMS PERMISSIBLE IN THE WEST WHERE SOCIAL FORMS AND FEARS HAVE NOT MUCH FOOTHOLD
MANY OF THESE RESIDENCES ARE STILL WELL KNOWN SUCH AS CARRIGCLEENA A CIRCLE OF GREY ROCKS NEAR MALLOW WHERE LIVED CLEENA THE FAIRY QUEEN OF SOUTH MUNSTER
WHICH WERE SOMETIMES COVERED OVER WITH GOLD SILVER OR BRONZE THE PEOPLE ALSO WORSHIPPED THE ELEMENTS THAT IS TO SAY WATER FIRE THE SUN THE WIND AND SUCH LIKE THE WORSHIP OF WELLS WAS VERY GENERAL
I MEAN TO BE THE MOTHER TO MANY MANY CHILDREN KARL SHE SAID IN A VOICE WHICH THRILLED WITH SORROW AND PRIDE AND A STRANGE JOY TO THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN
THE GREATEST FIRST AND AFTER THEM THE LESS AND THE LESS NO MORE LACKING IN BEAUTY THAN THE GREAT ALL WAS AS IT SHOULD BE ALL WAS ORDERED ALL WAS FIT AND WONDERFUL
RATHS OR FORTS THAT ARE FOUND EVERYWHERE IN IRELAND THE FAIRIES WERE NOT ALWAYS CONFINED TO THEIR DWELLINGS THEY OFTEN GOT OUT BUT THEY WERE GENERALLY INVISIBLE
HOW UNFALTERING THEY WOULD PACE TENEBROUS VALLEYS ALWAYS THEY WOULD BE TOGETHER THEIR LAUGHTER WOULD CHIME AND THEIR TEARS WOULD FALL IN UNISON WHERE ONE FAILED THE OTHER WOULD REDEEM WHERE ONE DOUBTED THE OTHER WOULD HOPE
ADMIT IT HONORA HONORA SIGHED HEAVILY OH YES
THEN YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED TO RESPECT ME AFTER ALL I WORSHIP YOU HE CRIED KATE SMILED SADLY I KNOW SHE SAID BUT WORSHIP PASSES NO HE FLUNG OUT
THAN I CAN MAKE THE WORDS CONVEY TO YOU BUT YOU MUST THINK THEM OVER KATE I BEG YOU TO THINK THEM OVER IN THE DARKNESS KATE HEARD HONORA STEALING AWAY TO HER ROOM
MY CRYSTAL BOAT WILL GUARD THEE TILL WE REACH THAT SILVER STRAND
IT WOULD BE BY LOOKING INTO THEIR FACES THAT ONE COULD SEE THE MARKS OF PASSION THE PASSION OF SORROW OF LOVE OF SACRIFICE AS THEY CAME OUT OF THE PINON GROVE HONORA DISCOVERED HER BABIES
FROM PAIN AND SORROW FREE
I WISH YOU A MERRY JUNE DECLARED MIRIAM WITH AN INFECTIOUS GIGGLE THAT WAS ECHOED BY THE OTHERS THEN ELFREDA OPENED THE PACKAGE FROM MIRIAM WHICH CONTAINED A JAPANESE SILK KIMONO SIMILAR TO ONE OF HER OWN THAT HER ROOMMATE HAD GREATLY ADMIRED
THEN THOUGHTFUL OF THE OTHER GIRL'S FEELINGS SHE SMILED AND STRETCHED OUT HER HAND DON'T SAY ANYTHING FURTHER ABOUT IT MISS GAINES I HOPE WE SHALL BE FRIENDS
MISTER SOUTHARD WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE HIS SISTER AND GUESTS AND AT TWO O'CLOCK THEY WERE GETTING INTO THEIR WRAPS PREPARATORY TO ACCOMPANYING MISS SOUTHARD TO ANOTHER THEATRE TO SEE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PLAYS OF THE SEASON THAT NIGHT THEY SAW THE ACTOR IN HAMLET
THAT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE TO CONSIDER BESIDES MYSELF THAT IS WHAT BEING A FRESHMAN AT OVERTON HAS TAUGHT ME
IT WILL BE EASIER TO NEGLECT ONE'S GARDEN THEN
WHEN THE CURTAIN SHUT OUT THE STILL FORM OF THE JAPANESE GIRL AND THE PRIMA DONNA RECEIVED HER USUAL OVATION
I HAVE ORDERED DINNER FOR SIX O'CLOCK EATING DINNER IN A DRESSING ROOM WAS AN INNOVATION AS FAR AS GRACE AND MIRIAM WERE CONCERNED
WE HAVE HAD A PERFECTLY WONDERFUL HOLIDAY ASSERTED GRACE AND THE SOUTHARDS ARE THE MOST HOSPITABLE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH I'D NEVER MAKE UP MY LOST SLEEP I SHALL BECOME A RABID ADVOCATE OF THE HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK RULE FOR THE NEXT WEEK AT LEAST
I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO THINK THAT ALMOST MY LAST ACT BEFORE GOING HOME TO MY MOTHER
AT THE STATION GROUPS OF HAPPY FACED GIRLS STOOD WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE PLENTY OF COMPANY OBSERVED ANNE DO YOU REMEMBER HOW FORLORN WE FELT WHEN WE WERE CAST AWAY ON THIS STATION PLATFORM LAST FALL WE WON'T FEEL SO STRANGE NEXT SEPTEMBER
NO THANK YOU I'LL STAND SHE REPLIED THEN IN A HALTING FASHION SHE SAID MISS HARLOWE I
YOU HAVE SHARP EYES SMILED MISTER SOUTHARD I HAPPENED TO REMEMBER THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT GOES INTO THIS RAREBIT NEXT I COULD FEEL MYSELF GROWING COLD WITH DESPAIR
ANNE WHO AT GRACE'S FIRST WORDS HAD STEPPED TO THE CHIFFONIER TOOK OUT A BERIBBONED BUNDLE AND STOOD HOLDING IT TOWARD THE STOUT GIRL ANOTHER MOMENT AND MIRIAM HAD RETURNED BEARING HER OFFERING
DID YOU NOTICE THE WAY THAT MISS WELLS LOOKED AT ME THIS MORNING MUTTERED MARY HAMPTON TO HER SATELLITES NEVER MIND A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT SNAPPED ALBERTA WICKS THE QUESTION IS WHERE IS J ELFREDA
GRACE'S HEART SWELLED WITH PRIDE AS SHE GAZED AT THE STATELY OLD BUILDING SURROUNDED BY ITS SILENT LEAFY GUARD OVERTON MY ALMA MATER SHE SAID SOFTLY
THEN SHE JOINED IN THE INSISTENT APPLAUSE THAT EVERETT SOUTHARD'S ART HAD EVOKED PRESENTLY THE ACTOR APPEARED AND BOWED HIS APPRECIATION OF THE TRIBUTE THEN HE MADE HIS EXIT NOR COULD HE BE INDUCED TO APPEAR AGAIN ANNE SAT AS THOUGH TURNED TO STONE
THE RAREBIT WAS VOTED A SUCCESS AFTER DECORATING THE ACTOR WITH A BIT OF BLUE RIBBON ON WHICH MIRIAM PAINSTAKINGLY PRINTED FIRST PREMIUM WITH A LEAD PENCIL HE WAS ESCORTED TO THE HEAD OF THE TABLE
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE VIRGINIA CHANGES HER MIND WHAT THE VANQUISHED SOPHOMORES THOUGHT OF THE TRICK THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED ON THEM WAS A MATTER FOR SPECULATION ONCE BACK IN OVERTON THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION HAD DAWNED UPON THEM
AND TREATED THEM TO AN UNWELCOME SURPRISE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ANY ONE OF THEM UNTIL THEY HAD RETURNED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HOUSES THAT THEY HAD LEFT J ELFREDA LOCKED IN THE HAUNTED ABODE OF THE TWO BROTHERS
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ONLY TWO HOURS AGO YOU WERE HAMLET LAUGHED GRACE YOU LOOK ANYTHING BUT TRAGIC NOW HE LOOKED EVERY BIT AS TRAGIC JUST A MOMENT AGO I SAW A DISTINCT HAMLET LIKE EXPRESSION CREEP INTO HIS FACE STATED MIRIAM BOLDLY
AND CONGRATULATED ROUNDLY UPON BEING ABLE NOT ONLY TO ACT BUT TO COOK THE NEXT MORNING EVERY ONE CONFESSED TO BEING A TRIFLE SLEEPY BUT APPEARED AT BREAKFAST AT THE USUAL TIME
HEARING NO SOUND FROM WITHIN SHE TURNED THE KNOB FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND STEPPED INSIDE
WHICH MISTER SOUTHARD ORDERED ARRANGED ON THE TABLE THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FOR THE OCCASION
DID YOU MENTION THAT SHE CHANGED IT VIOLENTLY SLYLY PUT IN MIRIAM I DID NOT WAS THE SMILING ASSERTION I DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT LET ALONE MENTION IT
I'VE THOUGHT OF A LOVELY PLAN TO LIGHTEN MY LABORS
AND SHE FINALLY WENT TO HER ROOM WISHING REGRETFULLY THAT SHE HAD BEEN LESS READY TO QUARREL WITH THE GIRLS WHO BADE FAIR TO LEAD THEIR CLASS BOTH IN SCHOLARSHIP AND POPULARITY
ON SATURDAY MORNING THE GIRLS WENT ON ANOTHER SHOPPING EXPEDITION
HER ARMS PILED HIGH WITH SKIRTS AND GOWNS DEPOSITING THEM ON THE FLOOR
THAT IS MY OPINION OF THE MATTER TOO AGREED GRACE
THEN THREE SLEEPY YOUNG WOMEN FAIRLY TUMBLED INTO THEIR BEDS COMPLETELY TIRED OUT BY THEIR EVENTFUL DAY AS THE RETURN TO OVERTON WAS TO BE MADE ON THE NOON TRAIN THE SOUTHARD HOUSEHOLD ROSE IN GOOD SEASON ON SUNDAY MORNING BREAKFAST WAS RATHER A QUIET MEAL
MISTER SOUTHARD HAD ARRANGED THAT THEY SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO HIS DRESSING ROOM IT WAS THE SAME THEATRE IN WHICH ANNE HAD PLAYED THE PREVIOUS WINTER AND SEVERAL OF THE STAGE HANDS RECOGNIZED HER AND BOWED RESPECTFULLY TO HER AS SHE PASSED THROUGH TO THE ACTOR'S DRESSING ROOM
IT WAS APPARENT THAT THEY STRONGLY SUSPECTED THE IDENTITY OF THE AVENGING SPECTERS ELFREDA'S PRESENCE TOO CONFIRMED THEIR SUSPICIONS IN A SPIRIT OF PURE MISCHIEF MABEL ASHE PULLED A LEAF FROM HER NOTE BOOK BORROWING A PENCIL
THEN WHEN WHEN WE DIDN'T SEE YOU BEFORE GOING HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS ANNE SUGGESTED THAT WE PUT THEM AWAY BECAUSE WE ALL HOPED THAT YOU'D BE FRIENDS WITH US AGAIN SOME DAY RUMMAGING IN THE TRAY OF HER TRUNK SHE PRODUCED A LONG FLAT PACKAGE WHICH SHE OFFERED TO ELFREDA
DIRECTLY AFTER CHAPEL THE NEXT MORNING EIGHT YOUNG WOMEN WERE TO BE SEEN IN AN ANXIOUS GROUP JUST OUTSIDE THE CHAPEL SEVERAL FRESHMEN AND TWO OR THREE JUNIORS GLANCED APPRAISINGLY AT THEM THEN PASSED ON
IN THE MEANTIME GRACE WAS TRYING VAINLY TO MAKE UP HER MIND WHAT TO DO SHOULD SHE GO DIRECTLY TO THE TWO MISCHIEVOUS SOPHOMORES REVEALING THE IDENTITY OF THE GHOSTS OR SHOULD SHE LEAVE THEM IN A QUANDARY AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THEIR UNWOMANLY TRICK
BUT WE CAN GET UP BOATING AND GYPSY PARTIES
THE EARLY WINTER DARKNESS WAS FALLING WHEN THE THREE GIRLS HURRIED UP THE STAIRS AT WAYNE HALL AS FAST AS THE WEIGHT OF THEIR SUIT CASES WOULD PERMIT MIRIAM'S DOOR WAS CLOSED SHE KNOCKED ON IT AT FIRST SOFTLY THEN WITH MORE FORCE
THAT MOST OF HIS TANTRUMS AS THEY CALLED THEM GREW OUT OF HIS HYSTERICAL HIDDEN FEAR MARY HAD BEEN SORRY FOR HIM WHEN HE HAD TOLD HER HE ALWAYS BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT IT WHEN HE WAS CROSS OR TIRED
FOR THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO COINED MONEY THEN BUT IN KIND THAT IS TO SAY CATTLE AND PROVISIONS OF VARIOUS SORTS PLOUGH OXEN HOGS SHEEP WITH MANTLES AND OTHER ARTICLES OF DRESS
BECAME SUDDENLY DISCONCERTED BY THE STEADY SCORNFUL GAZE OF TWO PAIRS OF EYES THAT LOOKED THEIR FULL MEASURE OF CONTEMPT AND HASTILY TURNING HIS ATTENTION TO MARIAN PASSED BY WITHOUT SPEAKING CONTEMPTIBLE COWARD RAGED GRACE DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID ANNE
TO SEE MARTHA STANDING WAITING FOR HER WITH A DOLEFUL FACE WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED WHAT DID COLIN SAY WHEN YOU TOLD HIM I COULDN'T COME
EMMA DEAN'S FAMILIAR DRAWL STARTLED BOTH GRACE AND ARLINE MY BROTHER HAD IT MADE FOR A COLLEGE PLAY CALLED SPHINX WHEN WE BEGAN TO PLAN FOR THE BAZAAR I SENT HOME FOR IT
HE'S SELFISH IF YOU LIKE MARY'S EYES FLASHED FIRE HE'S NICER THAN ANY OTHER BOY THAT EVER LIVED SHE SAID HE'S HE'S LIKE AN ANGEL IT MIGHT SOUND RATHER SILLY TO SAY THAT BUT SHE DID NOT CARE A NICE ANGEL COLIN SNEERED FEROCIOUSLY
THERE IS AN ARRANGEMENT INSIDE THE HEAD THAT MAKES PROMENADING POSSIBLE
THEY PAY MORE THAN THAT IN COMPANIES LIKE MISTER SOUTHARD'S REPLIED ANNE IF I HAD ACQUIRED FAME I COULD COMMAND TWICE THAT SUM I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY HE EVER CHOSE ME SUPPOSE I SHOULD FAIL ENTIRELY NONSENSE RETORTED GRACE YOU COULDN'T FAIL IF YOU TRIED
WHICH ALMOST PUT AN END TO THE CIRCUS THEN AND THERE AFTER DUE CONSIDERATION THE PERFORMERS AGREED TO GO ON WITH THE SPECTACLE BUT MANY AND INDIGNANT WERE THE THEORIES ADVANCED AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE NEWS HAD TRAVELED ABROAD THAT THE INFORMATION HAD GONE FORTH THROUGH A MEMBER OF THE CLUB
WITH BEST WISHES I REMAIN YOURS SINCERELY EVERETT SOUTHARD WELL I SHOULD SAY THE UNEXPECTED HAD HAPPENED SAID GRACE AS ANNE FINISHED READING
AND THAT HIS DECISIONS WERE TO BE STRAIGHT AND STAINLESS LIKE THE WAND SEVERAL OTHER FORMS HAD TO BE GONE THROUGH TILL THE CEREMONY WAS COMPLETED AND HE WAS THEN THE LAWFUL KING
AND HELD TO HER UNRELENTING RESOLVE TO BE REVENGED UPON THEM INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY WHENEVER THE OPPORTUNITY SHOULD ARISE IN CAUTIONING HER FRIENDS THE PREVIOUS YEAR AGAINST PLACING THEMSELVES IN A POSITION LIABLE TO PUT THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH ELEANOR
THEN THEY PAUSED BEFORE A PLATFORM ABOUT FOUR FEET IN HEIGHT ON WHICH REPOSED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GIGANTIC SPHINX HER PAWS STIFFLY FOLDED IN FRONT OF HER ASK ME A QUESTION
WHY ANNE THINK OF IT YOU WILL HAVE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SIX WEEKS WORK
AND IF NECESSARY TAKE THEIR VOTES WHEN THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS AND BESIDES THIS KINGS AS WE SHALL SEE FARTHER ON HAD TO OBEY THE LAW THE SAME AS THEIR SUBJECTS
AND DICKON TALKED TO HIM JUST AS HE HAD TALKED TO THE ROBIN
HE SAID MARY FLEW INTO A FINE PASSION SHE COULD FLY INTO A PASSION WITHOUT MAKING A NOISE
AND THEY WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT THE PICTURES AND READ SOME OF THE GARDENING BOOKS AND PERHAPS TRIED PLAYING THE GAMES AND HE WOULD HAVE ENJOYED HIMSELF SO MUCH
HER COMPANION ANSWERED IN ROUGH TONES
IF THE DISTRICT WAS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO HAVE A KING IT WAS RULED BY A CHIEF WHO WAS SUBJECT TO THE KING OF THE LARGER TERRITORY IN WHICH THE DISTRICT WAS INCLUDED THE KING WAS ALWAYS CHOSEN FROM ONE PARTICULAR RULING FAMILY
AS SHE AND GRACE WERE TAKING A LAST WALK AROUND THE GREAT GAYLY DECORATED ROOM BEFORE GOING TO LUNCHEON THAT DAY NOW AS THEY STOOD SIDE BY SIDE ANXIOUSLY WATCHING THE STEADILY INCREASING TIDE OF VISITORS
DOLLS TOYS BOOKS SHE OPENED THE PACKAGE WONDERING IF HE HAD SENT A DOLL
HE HAD A LARGE TRACT OF LAND FREE BESIDES WHICH EVERY TENANT AND HOUSEHOLDER THROUGHOUT HIS DOMINION HAD TO MAKE A YEARLY PAYMENT ACCORDING TO HIS MEANS THESE PAYMENTS WERE MADE NOT IN MONEY
ALL WITH GOOD SALARIES THE HIGHER THE GRADE OF THE KING THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF HIS HOUSEHOLD AND THE GRANDER THE PERSONS HOLDING OFFICES FORMING PART OF HIS RETINUE THERE WERE NOBLES WHO DID NOTHING AT ALL BUT WAIT ON HIM
IN THE HEARING OF ALL THAT HE WOULD GOVERN HIS PEOPLE WITH STRICT JUSTICE AND THAT HE WOULD OBSERVE THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND MAINTAIN THE OLD CUSTOMS OF THE TRIBE OR KINGDOM THEN HE PUT BY HIS SWORD
JUST THEN ANNE EXCLAIMED VERY SOFTLY LOOK GRACE ISN'T THAT MARIAN AND HER CAVALIER WHERE ASKED GRACE TURNING QUICKLY ACROSS THE STREET COMING IN THIS DIRECTION I DO BELIEVE MARIAN IS CRYING TOO THEY ARE CROSSING NOW AND WILL PASS US
YOU KNOW MY VIEWS ON THAT SUBJECT I WAS ONLY JESTING DEAR GRACE ASSURED HER SEEING THE LOOK OF ANXIETY THAT CREPT INTO ANNE'S EYES I KNOW YOU'LL COME BACK WE COULDN'T GRADUATE WITHOUT YOU
AND THE APPLAUSE HAD DIED AWAY IN A PLEASANT HUM OF CONVERSATION THAT AROSE FROM THE THRONG OF STUDENTS AND VISITORS THAT MORE THAN COMFORTABLY FILLED THE GYMNASIUM I DON'T SEE HOW THOSE GIRLS MANAGED TO ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH IN SO SHORT A TIME
THE HOUSE STEWARD'S OFFICE WAS ONE OF GREAT RESPONSIBILITY AND HE HAD PLENTY OF ANXIETY AND WORRY AND ACCORDINGLY HE HELD A HIGH RANK AND WAS WELL PAID FOR HIS SERVICES THERE WAS A CHAMPION
AND ISN'T SHE GREAT HOW DID EMMA HAPPEN TO THINK OF HER LET ALONE GETTING HER UP
SHE WAS CROSS AND DISAPPOINTED
THEN ALBERTA WICKS MARY HAMPTON AND KATHLEEN WEST WERE USHERED INTO THE TENT I AM THE SPHINX BEGAN THE FAR AWAY VOICE AGAIN IN THE MAMMOTH HEAD ASK ME A QUESTION
AND HAD A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHT AS IT WAS THEY DID THE NEXT THING TO IT YOU ARE A SELFISH THING
BOTH DECLARED ARLINE BOLDLY
THE OLD IRISH KINGS LIVED IN GREAT STYLE ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE HIGHER RANKS AND LIKE THE KINGS OF OUR OWN DAY KEPT IN THEIR PALACES NUMBERS OF PERSONS TO ATTEND ON THEM HOLDING VARIOUS OFFICES
IT WAS A LITTLE WORK OF ART THAT LAY IN A BOX A TOY NIGHTINGALE WHICH WAS TO SING LIKE A LIVE ONE BUT IT WAS ALL COVERED WITH DIAMONDS RUBIES AND SAPPHIRES
AND THE NIGHTINGALE SANG SO GLORIOUSLY THAT THE TEARS CAME INTO THE EMPEROR'S EYES AND THE TEARS RAN DOWN OVER HIS CHEEKS AND THEN THE NIGHTINGALE SANG STILL MORE SWEETLY
YES HE DECLARED THAT IT WAS BETTER THAN THE REAL NIGHTINGALE NOT ONLY IN ITS FEATHERS AND ITS MANY BEAUTIFUL DIAMONDS BUT INSIDE AS WELL FOR YOU SEE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND ABOVE ALL YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY
WHO WAS SO GRAND THAT IF ANY ONE LOWER IN RANK THAN HE DARED TO SPEAK TO HIM OR TO ASK HIM ANY QUESTION
TO THE POOR FISHERMAN TO THE PEASANT'S ROOF TO EVERY ONE WHO DWELLS FAR AWAY FROM YOU AND FROM YOUR COURT I LOVE YOUR HEART MORE THAN YOUR CROWN AND YET THE CROWN HAS AN AIR OF SANCTITY ABOUT IT I WILL COME AND SING TO YOU
AND SANG SO THAT IT WAS A JOY TO HEAR IT IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE GLASS BELLS SAID THE CAVALIER AND LOOK
AND AGAIN HE RAN UP AND DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND THROUGH ALL THE HALLS AND PASSAGES AND HALF THE COURT RAN WITH HIM
FIVE YEARS HAD GONE BY AND A REAL GRIEF CAME UPON THE WHOLE NATION THE CHINESE WERE REALLY FOND OF THEIR EMPEROR AND NOW HE WAS SICK AND COULD NOT IT WAS SAID LIVE MUCH LONGER
AND THE TRAVELERS TOLD OF IT WHEN THEY CAME HOME AND THE LEARNED MEN WROTE MANY BOOKS ABOUT THE TOWN THE PALACE AND THE GARDEN BUT THEY DID NOT FORGET THE NIGHTINGALE THAT WAS SPOKEN OF MOST OF ALL
THE REST QUITE LOVELY AND MILD THESE WERE ALL THE EMPEROR'S BAD AND GOOD DEEDS THAT STOOD BEFORE HIM NOW THAT DEATH SAT UPON HIS HEART DO YOU REMEMBER THIS WHISPERED ONE TO THE OTHER DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
IT'S WONDERFUL THAT WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE THAT BIRD WILL BE A GREAT SUCCESS AT COURT SHALL I SING ONCE MORE BEFORE THE EMPEROR ASKED THE NIGHTINGALE FOR IT THOUGHT THE EMPEROR WAS PRESENT
WERE TO BE SEEN THE MOST WONDERFUL FLOWERS AND TO THE PRETTIEST OF THEM SILVER BELLS WERE TIED WHICH TINKLED SO THAT NOBODY SHOULD PASS BY WITHOUT NOTICING THE FLOWERS YES EVERYTHING IN THE EMPEROR'S GARDEN WAS NICELY SET OUT
AND ALL THOSE WHO WERE POETS WROTE GREAT POEMS ABOUT THE NIGHTINGALE IN THE WOOD BY THE DEEP LAKE THE BOOKS WENT ALL OVER THE WORLD AND A FEW OF THEM ONCE CAME TO THE EMPEROR HE SAT IN HIS GOLDEN CHAIR AND READ AND READ
EVERY MOMENT HE NODDED HIS HEAD FOR IT PLEASED HIM TO HEAR THE FINE THINGS THAT WERE SAID ABOUT THE CITY THE PALACE AND THE GARDEN BUT THE NIGHTINGALE IS THE BEST OF ALL IT STOOD WRITTEN THERE
STOPPED STILL AND LISTENED WHEN HE HAD GONE OUT AT NIGHT TO THROW OUT HIS NETS
AND HE SAID THE NIGHTINGALE SHOULD HAVE HIS GOLDEN SLIPPER TO WEAR ROUND ITS NECK BUT THE NIGHTINGALE THANKED HIM
THREE AND THIRTY TIMES OVER DID IT SING THE SAME PIECE AND YET WAS NOT TIRED THE PEOPLE WOULD GLADLY HAVE HEARD IT AGAIN BUT THE EMPEROR SAID THAT THE LIVING NIGHTINGALE OUGHT TO SING A LITTLE SOMETHING BUT WHERE WAS IT
FROM ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD TRAVELERS CAME TO THE CITY OF THE EMPEROR AND ADMIRED IT AND THE PALACE AND THE GARDEN BUT WHEN THEY HEARD THE NIGHTINGALE THEY ALL SAID THAT IS THE BEST OF ALL
NO ONE HAD NOTICED THAT IT HAD FLOWN AWAY OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW BACK TO ITS GREEN WOODS BUT WHAT IS BECOME OF IT ASKED THE EMPEROR THEN ALL THE COURTIERS SCOLDED AND THOUGHT THE NIGHTINGALE WAS A VERY THANKLESS CREATURE
THE EMPEROR'S PALACE WAS THE MOST SPLENDID IN THE WORLD IT WAS MADE WHOLLY OF FINE PORCELAIN VERY COSTLY BUT SO BRITTLE AND SO HARD TO HANDLE THAT ONE HAD TO TAKE CARE HOW ONE TOUCHED IT IN THE GARDEN
THAT YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIRD WHO TELLS YOU EVERYTHING THEN ALL WILL GO WELL
WERE RANGED ABOUT IT IN TITLE IT HAD COME TO BE HIGH IMPERIAL AFTER DINNER SINGER AND IN RANK IT WAS NUMBER ONE ON THE LEFT HAND FOR THE EMPEROR RECKONED THAT SIDE THE MOST IMPORTANT ON WHICH THE HEART IS PLACED
I HAVE NEVER HEARD IT NAMED REPLIED THE CAVALIER IT HAS NEVER BEEN PRESENTED AT COURT I COMMAND THAT IT SHALL COME HERE THIS EVENING AND SING BEFORE ME SAID THE EMPEROR ALL THE WORLD KNOWS WHAT I HAVE AND I DO NOT KNOW IT MYSELF
I DON'T KNOW THAT AT ALL IS THERE SUCH A BIRD IN MY EMPIRE AND IN MY GARDEN TO BOOT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT ONE HAS TO READ ABOUT SUCH THINGS HEREUPON HE CALLED HIS CAVALIER
AND DRIVEN DEATH FROM MY HEART HOW CAN I PAY YOU YOU HAVE PAID ME REPLIED THE NIGHTINGALE I DREW TEARS FROM YOUR EYES THE FIRST TIME I SANG I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT
SO THEY ALL WENT OUT INTO THE WOOD WHERE THE NIGHTINGALE WAS WONT TO SING HALF THE COURT WENT OUT WHEN THEY WERE ON THE WAY A COW BEGAN TO LOW OH CRIED THE COURT PAGES NOW WE HAVE IT
THE MOST GLORIOUS FLOWERS WHICH COULD RING CLEARLY HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE HALLS THERE WAS A RUNNING TO AND FRO AND A DRAUGHT OF AIR BUT ALL THE BELLS RANG SO EXACTLY TOGETHER THAT ONE COULD NOT HEAR ANY NOISE
WHERE THE ELDER BLOSSOM SMELLS SWEET AND WHERE THE FRESH GRASS IS WET WITH THE TEARS OF MOURNERS THEN DEATH FELT A LONGING TO SEE HIS GARDEN AND FLOATED OUT AT THE WINDOW IN THE FORM OF A COLD WHITE MIST
WILL YOU GIVE ME THE EMPEROR'S CROWN AND DEATH GAVE UP EACH OF THESE TREASURES FOR A SONG AND THE NIGHTINGALE SANG ON AND ON IT SANG OF THE QUIET CHURCHYARD WHERE THE WHITE ROSES GROW
YE DON'T HAVE TER HAVE EM IF YE DON'T WANT EM YOU CAN CHANGE EM UGH SHUDDERED MISSUS MERIDETH MARGARET HOW CAN YOU LAUGH WHY IT'S FUNNY I THINK LAUGHED MARGARET AGAIN AS SHE TURNED AWAY
BUT YOU DON'T MEAN
MC GINNIS PAUSED HIS BREATH SUSPENDED BUT I DO SHE ANSWERED THE QUICK RED FLYING TO HER CHEEKS THEN HALF LAUGHING HALF CRYING SHE FALTERED AND
ONLY ON THAT ONE CONDITION MARGARET SMILED BUT SHE MADE NO COMMENT IT WAS ENOUGH TO FIGHT PRESENT BATTLES WITHOUT TRYING TO WIN FUTURE ONES
HAVE CHANGED YOUR OPINION OF HER GENTLENESS SHE SHE FOUGHT HIM
STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART HARRY
IN THE CHILDREN'S VACATION HOME FOR THE POOR LITTLE WAIFS FROM THE CITY AN TER THINK OF HER FINDIN HER OWN BABY JEST BY GIVIN SOME OTHER WOMAN'S BABY A BIT OF JOY CRIED MISSUS MERTON
TO BECOME AT ONCE MARGARET KENDALL THE DAINTY LITTLE DAUGHTER OF A WELL BRED FASTIDIOUS MOTHER TO THE DOCTOR
SOMETIMES IT WAS AMBITION THERE WERE MEN WHO COULD NOT EVEN SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF THEIR ADOPTED COUNTRY INTELLIGIBLY YET WHO HAD EVER BEFORE THEM THE ONE END AND AIM MONEY TO THIS END AND AIM
THERE WERE OTHER PHASES TOO
FOR ONE MOMENT MARGARET GAZED INTO THE MAN'S FACE WITH STARTLED EYES THEN SHE TURNED AND COVERED HER OWN TELLTALE FACE WITH HER HANDS AND BECAUSE IT WAS A TELLTALE FACE SPENCER TOOK A LONG STRIDE TOWARD HER
DOUBTLESS THAT WAS HALF THE CAUSE OF HER PRESENT RESTLESSNESS AND UNHAPPINESS SHE HAD LOVED HIM ALL THE TIME AND DID NOT KNOW IT SURELY THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WORLD WHO COULD SO WISELY HELP HER IN HER DEAR WORK
THAT IT COULD NOT BE EASY FOR HIM TO SEE HER SO FREQUENTLY NOW THAT THE ENGAGEMENT WAS BROKEN MARGARET BLAMED HERSELF BITTERLY NOT FOR THE BROKEN ENGAGEMENT BUT FOR THE FACT
CHAPTER THIRTY ONE
YOU'LL NEED A REST ALL RIGHT I'M THINKING AND WE'LL KEEP YOU JUST AS LONG AS WE CAN TOO WITH LIGHTNING RAPIDITY MISSUS MERIDETH HAD CHANGED THEIR PLANS IN HER MIND THEY WOULD GO TO NEW YORK NOT EGYPT EGYPT HAD SEEMED DESIRABLE
SHE'S HOME NOW IN HER OWN MOTHER'S ARMS
AND HAD MATERIALLY STRENGTHENED THE TEACHING FORCE AS FOR HILCREST SHE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT STAY AT HILCREST ANYWAY NOW
YOU POOR CHILD OF COURSE YOU DO AND NO WONDER YOU ARE WORN OUT WITH THE STRAIN MARGARET SHE RAISED A PROTESTING HAND NO NO YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND I I HAVE MADE A FAILURE OF IT
WHY DON'T YOU COME TO ME FRANKLY AND FREELY AND TELL ME THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE THERE WAS NO ANSWER THE MAN HAD HALF TURNED HIS FACE SO THAT ONLY HIS PROFILE SHOWED CLEAN CUT AND SQUARE CHINNED AGAINST THE CLOSE SHUT DOOR
GRADUALLY HER CONFUSED SENSES WERE COMING INTO SOMETHING LIKE ORDER SLOWLY HER DAZED THOUGHTS WERE TAKING SHAPE IT WAS HER OWN FAULT SHE HAD BROUGHT THIS THING UPON HERSELF
WELL WHY DON'T YE CALL IT THE MILL HOUSE THEN AN DONE WITH IT DEMANDED PATTY PATTY YOU'RE A GENIUS I WILL CRIED MARGARET AND THE MILL HOUSE IT WAS FROM THAT DAY
MANY'S THE NIGHT I'VE WALKED THE STREET OUTSIDE WATCHING THE LIGHT AT YOUR WINDOW AND MANY'S THE NIGHT I'VE NOT GONE HOME UNTIL DAWN
YOU SHOULD HEAR PATTY SAY IT REALLY TO APPRECIATE IT
OH BUT IF I'M HERE I SHALL BE THERE CONTESTED MARGARET WITH A HASTE THAT REFUSED TO CONSIDER LOGIC THEN AS SHE SAW THE WHIMSICAL SMILE COME INTO THE MAN'S EYES SHE ADDED BROKENLY
AND HE TURNED AWAY A WEEK LATER MARGARET LEARNED THAT ROSY AND KATY WERE OUT OF SCHOOL WHEN SHE LOOKED THEM UP SHE FOUND THEM AT WORK IN THE MILLS THIS MATTER OF THE SCHOOL QUESTION WAS A GREAT PUZZLE TO MARGARET VERY EARLY IN HER EFFORTS
IT IS AT THE MILLS THEMSELVES THAT THE FIRST START MUST BE MADE THE FIRST BEGINNING OF THE DIVVYING UP PERHAPS IF THERE WERE SOME ONE TO SHOW US HE PAUSED THEN WENT ON UNSTEADILY
LITTLE BULLETINS FROM THE SICK ROOM THEN HAD COME THE GOOD NEWS THAT FRANK WAS OUT OF DANGER THOUGH STILL FAR TOO WEAK TO UNDERTAKE THE LONG JOURNEY HOME THEIR LETTERS SHOWED UNMISTAKABLY THEIR IMPATIENCE AT THE DELAY AND QUESTIONED HER AS TO HER HEALTH AND WELFARE
AS SHE FELL BACK AND HIS EYES STILL BLAZED INTO HERS I AM AFRAID I'M AFRAID OF MYSELF HE CRIED I DON'T DARE TO TRUST MYSELF WITHIN SIGHT OF YOUR DEAR EYES OR WITHIN TOUCH OF YOUR DEAR HANDS THOUGH ALL THE WHILE I'M HUNGRY FOR BOTH
AN THE BOY BOBBY BACK FROM THE CITY AND AIN'T SADIE GETTIN WELL AN STRONG ON THE FARM HERE AND IT'S A COMFORT TER ME TOO WHEN I REMEMBER TWAS BOBBY WHO FIRST FOUND THE LITTLE MARGARET
AND THEN HURRY BACK TO AMERICA ALONE AS FOR FRANK HIMSELF HE HAD NOT WRITTEN HER SINCE HIS ILLNESS MARGARET WAS THINKING OF ALL THIS AND WAS FEELING SPECIALLY FORLORN
THERE WAS A FEVERISHNESS IN MARGARET'S MANNER AND A TREMULOUSNESS IN HER VOICE
CERTAINLY BUT SHE WAS OVERWHELMED NOT ONLY THE CAKES AND THE TIDIES HOWEVER GAVE MISSUS KENDALL FOOD FOR THOUGHT DURING THOSE FIRST FEW DAYS AFTER MARGARET'S RETURN
WITH AN EXALTATION THAT RENDERED HER OBLIVIOUS TO TASTE AND FEELING IN DUE TIME THE MILL HOUSE AS MARGARET CALLED HER NEW HOME WAS READY FOR OCCUPANCY AND THE FAMILY MOVED IN NAMING THE PLACE HAD GIVEN MARGARET NO LITTLE FOOD FOR THOUGHT
ON THE LOST AND FOUND NOR WAS THIS ALL TO MISSUS KENDALL IT SEEMED THAT ALMOST EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE PLACE CAME TO HER DOOR WITH INQUIRIES AND CONGRATULATIONS TOGETHER
IF THE MAN HEARD HE DID NOT HEED THE BONDS OF HIS SELF CONTROL HAD SNAPPED AND THE TORRENT OF WORDS CAME WITH A FORCE THAT TOLD HOW GREAT HAD BEEN THE PRESSURE
THE LOOK OF FRANTIC HORROR PASSED SLOWLY OUT OF HER EYES GIVING WAY TO ACUTE MISERY AS HE TALKED AND AS HIS PERSONALITY ONCE MORE BEGAN TO DOMINATE HER OWN BUT IT WAS NOT YET OVER BUT THE VOLORS SHE CRIED THE VOLORS
SO THICK AND INCESSANT IT WAS SO COMPLETE HER CONCENTRATION IN THE SENSE OF SIGHT EXCEPT FOR THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FROM ITS SUDDENNESS AND OVERWHELMING FORCE SOME MOB OF PHANTOMS TROOPING ON A SUDDEN
MEN WERE NOT YET PERFECT HE SAID THERE RAN IN THEIR VEINS THE BLOOD OF MEN WHO FOR TWENTY CENTURIES HAD BEEN CHRISTIANS THERE MUST BE NO DESPAIR FAITH IN MAN WAS OF THE VERY ESSENCE OF RELIGION FAITH IN MAN'S BEST SELF IN WHAT HE WOULD BECOME
HE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING WELL AFTER ALL MAN WAS NOT YET PERFECTLY CIVILISED HE DID NOT LIKE TO THINK OF WHAT AWAITED HIM AT HOME ONCE ABOUT FIVE HOURS EARLIER HE HAD LISTENED TO HIS WIFE'S VOICE THROUGH THE TELEPHONE
THERE GIVE ME YOUR HANDS NOW LISTEN TO ME
RUNNING OR WALKING SHE HARDLY KNEW ROUND THE CORNER TO THE RIGHT AND THE ENTIRE SPACE WAS ONE STREAM OF HEADS AND FACES PRESSING SO FIERCELY THAT THE GROUP AT THE RAILINGS WERE DETACHED LIKE WEEDS AND DRIFTED TOO SIDEWAYS CLUTCHING AT THE BARS
BY THE WISDOM OF HER PONTIFFS OVER RULED BY GOD ALMIGHTY THE LINES HAD BEEN DRAWING TIGHTER EVERY YEAR HE INSTANCED THE ABOLITION OF ALL LOCAL USAGES INCLUDING THOSE SO LONG CHERISHED BY THE EAST
OUT OF SOME VISTA OF THE SPIRITUAL WORLD VISIBLE ACROSS AN OPEN SPACE AND ABOUT TO VANISH AGAIN IN OBSCURITY THAT EMPTY STREET WAS FULL NOW ON THIS SIDE AND THAT SO FAR AS SHE COULD SEE THE YOUNG MEN WERE GONE
SWEPT AWAY IN THIS MURDEROUS PASSION OF THE PEOPLE OF HER FAITH THEY WERE NO BETTER THAN CHRISTIANS AFTER ALL AS FIERCE AS THE MEN ON WHOM THEY AVENGED THEMSELVES AS DARK AS THOUGH THE SAVIOUR JULIAN HAD NEVER COME IT WAS ALL LOST
IT WAS AS IF PROGRESS HAD NOT YET BEGUN AND VOLORS WERE UNINVENTED AS IF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE HAD NOT COME TO DISBELIEVE IN GOD AND TO DISCOVER THAT ITSELF WAS GOD
PERCY BEGAN TO LOOK WITH ALL HIS EYES HE KNEW THE POPE'S FACE WELL FROM A HUNDRED PHOTOGRAPHS AND MOVING PICTURES EVEN HIS GESTURES WERE FAMILIAR TO HIM THE SLIGHT BOWING OF THE HEAD IN ASSENT
I TELL YOU THAT IF WE HAD FORBIDDEN IT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN YET MORE MURDER AND THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE LOST THEIR RULERS WE WERE PASSIVE SINCE WE COULD DO NOTHING AH BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO DIE OH OLIVER LET ME DIE AT LEAST I CANNOT BEAR IT
HOLY FATHER THE MASS PRAYER THE ROSARY THESE FIRST AND LAST THE WORLD DENIES THEIR POWER IT IS ON THEIR POWER THAT CHRISTIANS MUST THROW ALL THEIR WEIGHT ALL THINGS IN JESUS CHRIST IN JESUS CHRIST FIRST AND LAST NOTHING ELSE CAN AVAIL
HE HAD SEEN THAT SILENCE ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A HORROR ONCE AT ANY RATE AT THE SIGHT OF A SPLASH OF BLOOD ON HER SHOE WELL MY DARLING SIT DOWN AT LEAST HE SAID SHE OBEYED HIM MECHANICALLY
ON THE OTHER HAND IT WOULD REASSURE THE FAITHFUL AND PURGE OUT THE HALF HEARTED ONCE IN THE EARLY AGES SATAN'S ATTACK HAD BEEN MADE ON THE BODILY SIDE WITH WHIPS AND FIRE AND BEASTS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY IT HAD BEEN ON THE INTELLECTUAL SIDE
AH THE PATHOS OF IT ALL THE DESPAIRING ACCEPTANCE OF ANY CREED THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR SORROW THE WILD WORSHIP OF ANY GOD WHO HAD CLAIMED TO BEAR IT AND AGAIN CAME THE SOUND STRIKING ACROSS HER PEACE
GIVING THE IMPRESSION OF A CURIOUS MINGLING OF ASCETIC POVERTY AND DIGNITY BY ITS RED TILED FLOOR
LIFTING THE THIN WHITE HAND STRETCHED OUT TO HIS LIPS HE HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE AS HE STOOD UP FATHER FRANKLIN HOLINESS SAID THE CARDINAL'S VOICE AT HIS EAR
HE LOOSED HER HANDS AND STILL SMILED AT HER THE BELL SHE SAID WITH A FLASH OF APPREHENSION BUT IT IS ALL WELL BETWEEN US AGAIN HER FACE STEADIED ITSELF INTO LOYALTY AND CONFIDENCE IT IS ALL WELL SHE SAID
INSTANTLY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE SUBURBS WHERE THEY WERE NO LONGER UNDER HIS JURISDICTION BUT HE HAD NOT STAYED HERE HE HAD SENT ONCE MORE AMBASSADORS TO EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD INFORMING THE GOVERNMENT OF EACH OF THEIR ARRIVAL
SHE WAS WATCHING THOSE STRANGE EMBLEMS STRAINING HER EYES THROUGH THE DUSK STRIVING TO DISTINGUISH THE BATTERED BROKEN SHAPES HALF GUESSING YET AFRAID TO GUESS THEN ON A SUDDEN FROM THE HIDDEN LAMPS BENEATH THE EAVES LIGHT LEAPED INTO BEING
AND THIS WAS THE MAN THOUGHT PERCY PAPA ANGELICUS WHOM HE WAS TO SEE IN A MINUTE OR TWO THE CARDINAL PUT HIS HAND ON THE PRIEST'S KNEE AS THE DOOR OPENED AND A PURPLE PRELATE APPEARED BOWING
HE MUST DO ALL FOR WE CAN DO NOTHING THE WHITE HEAD BOWED THEN IT ROSE ERECT YES MY SON BUT SO LONG AS JESUS CHRIST DEIGNS TO USE US WE MUST BE USED HE IS PROPHET AND KING AS WELL AS PRIEST
WE THEN TOO MUST BE PROPHET AND KING AS WELL AS PRIEST WHAT OF PROPHECY AND ROYALTY THE VOICE THRILLED PERCY LIKE A TRUMPET YES HOLINESS FOR PROPHECY THEN LET US PREACH CHARITY FOR ROYALTY LET US REIGN ON CROSSES
AND WHEN THAT WAS DONE THE CHURCH'S CAUSE UNLESS GOD INTERVENED WOULD BE OVER PERCY SAT BACK TREMBLING YES MY SON AND WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE
RUBRICS AND THE AFFAIRS OF MISSIONARY COUNTRIES WITH THE NEW AND EXTRAORDINARY PRIVILEGES GRANTED TO MISSION PRIESTS AT THIS POINT HE BECAME AWARE THAT HIS SELF CONSCIOUSNESS HAD LEFT HIM AND HE BEGAN EVEN WITH LITTLE GESTURES
THE CHIN WAS FIRM AND CLOVEN AND THE POISE OF THE WHOLE HEAD WAS STRANGELY YOUTHFUL IT WAS A FACE OF GREAT GENEROSITY AND SWEETNESS SET AT AN ANGLE BETWEEN DEFIANCE AND HUMILITY BUT ECCLESIASTICAL FROM EAR TO EAR AND BROW TO CHIN
BUT THAT AT PRESENT THEY WERE TOO EXCITING TO THE IMAGINATION SO HE HAD REMOVED THE TRAMS THE VOLORS THE LABORATORIES THE MANUFACTORIES
AND THAT SOMETHING INDEFINABLE IS STIRRING WITHIN US WE HESITATE TO TURN AGAINST OUR BREASTS A LITTLE PIECE OF STEEL OR BLOW OUT OUR BRAINS WITH A LITTLE INSTRUMENT NO LARGER THAN OUR HAND IT SEEMS TO US THAT CHAOS WOULD RETURN AGAIN
IN HER LANGUOR COULD BE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED THAT GENTLENESS OF SOUL THAT LETHARGY OF THE WEAKER OF TWO BEINGS WHO LOVE ONE OF WHOM EXISTS ONLY IN THE OTHER AND RESPONDS TO HIM AS DOES THE ECHO THE YOUNG MAN WAS CONSCIOUS OF IT AND SEEMED PROUD OF IT AND GRATEFUL FOR IT
INTO THE HEART OF THE BEING WHO OPENS HER ARMS TO YOU YOU WILL PLUNGE THAT BLOOD STAINED BUT REPENTANT ARM
WHEN HE SMILED SHE SMILED TOO BUT NEVER ALONE WHEN HE SPOKE SHE REPLIED AND SHE ATE WHAT HE SERVED HER BUT THERE WAS ABOUT HER A SILENCE WHICH WAS ONLY BROKEN AT HIS INSTANCE
AND SPARE THEM THE SEVERE LESSONS OF UNHAPPINESS OUR WISDOM AND SKEPTICISM ARE IN OUR HANDS BUT CHILDREN'S TOYS FORGIVE US FOR DREAMING THAT WE CAN DEFY THEE THOU WHO SMILEST AT GOLGOTHA THE WORST RESULT OF ALL OUR VAIN MISERY IS THAT IT TEMPTS US TO FORGET THEE
THE BEINGS MOVE ABOUT CROSS EACH OTHER'S PATHS CLASP EACH OTHER FOR AN HOUR AND THEN FALL AND OTHERS RISE IN THEIR PLACE WHERE LIFE FAILS LIFE HASTENS TO THE SPOT WHERE AIR IS WANTING AIR RUSHES
NEVER ALLOW THEM TO WHITEN IF THEY ARE NOT WHITE TO NIGHT AND THEN WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN THE WORLD IF YOU GO AWAY WHERE WILL YOU GO WHAT CAN YOU HOPE FOR IF YOU REMAIN AH IN LOOKING AT THAT WOMAN YOU SEEM TO HAVE A TREASURE BURIED IN YOUR HEART IT IS NOT MERELY THAT YOU LOSE HER
THERE IS AMONG THEM ALL BUT ONE THAT DOES NOT DISTURB THAT PENETRATES AND THAT DIES ONLY WITH THE BEING IN WHICH IT HAS TAKEN ROOT BUT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME YES AT FIRST FOR WHAT I HAVE TO SUFFER IS SO KEEN THAT THE ABSENCE OF THE HABITUAL OBJECT OF MY LOVE WOULD KILL ME
YOU ARE GOING AWAY AND FOREVER WHAT YOU MY LIFE MY ADORED MISTRESS YOU FLEE FROM ME I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN NEVER NEVER I SAID ALOUD AND ADDRESSING MYSELF TO THE SLEEPING BRIGITTE AS THOUGH SHE COULD HEAR ME I ADDED
THESE THINGS ARE BUT AN ABSURD DREAM I RECALLED THE TIME WHEN I WAS IGNORANT OF LIFE WHEN I WAS TAKING MY FIRST STEPS IN EXPERIENCE I REMEMBERED AN OLD BEGGAR WHO USED TO SIT ON A STONE BENCH BEFORE THE FARM GATE TO WHOM I WAS SOMETIMES SENT WITH THE REMAINS OF OUR MORNING MEAL
I AM A FOOL A MADMAN A CHILD WHO THINKS HIMSELF A MAN GOD BE PRAISED YOU ARE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL YOU LIVE AND YOU WILL FORGET ME
WHILE NOT BELIEVING IN HIM MYSELF I RECOILED KNOWING THAT SHE BELIEVED IN HIM IT WAS NOT VAIN TERROR THAT ARRESTED MY HAND WHO SAW ME I WAS ALONE AND IT WAS NIGHT WAS IT PREJUDICE WHAT PREVENTED ME FROM HURLING OUT OF MY SIGHT THAT LITTLE PIECE OF BLACK WOOD
I BEAT MY BREAST AND ALTHOUGH LOOKING AT HER I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT I TOUCHED HER AS THOUGH TO ASSURE MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT A DREAM MY FACE AS I SAW IT IN THE GLASS REGARDED ME WITH ASTONISHMENT
WHO AMUSES HIMSELF AND WHILES AWAY AN IDLE HOUR WATCHING THIS SPECTACLE OF CREATION ALWAYS RENEWED AND ALWAYS DYING SEEING THE WORK OF MAN'S HANDS RISING THE GRASS GROWING LOOKING UPON THE PLANTING OF THE SEED AND THE FALL OF THE THUNDERBOLT
THAT SOUL AND THAT BODY ARE THY BROTHERS FOR SIX MONTHS THY MOUTH HAS NOT SPOKEN THY HEART HAS NOT THROBBED WITHOUT A RESPONSIVE WORD AND HEART BEAT FROM HER AND THAT WOMAN WHOM GOD HAS SENT THEE AS HE SENDS THE ROSE TO THE FIELD
BEHOLDING MAN WALKING ABOUT UPON HIS EARTH UNTIL HE MEETS THE BECKONING FINGER OF DEATH COUNTING TEARS AND WATCHING THEM DRY UPON THE CHEEK OF PAIN NOTING THE PURE PROFILE OF LOVE AND THE WRINKLED FACE OF AGE SEEING HANDS STRETCHED UP TO HIM IN SUPPLICATION
I THREW MYSELF ON THE FOOT OF THE BED IN SUCH A FRIGHTFUL STATE OF DESPAIR THAT MY REASON FLED AND I NO LONGER KNEW WHERE I WAS OR WHAT I WAS DOING BRIGITTE SIGHED MY SENSES STIRRED WITHIN ME WAS IT GRIEF OR DESPAIR I DO NOT KNOW
HOW CAN THE WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN PRAISED RESOLVE TO BE PRAISED NO MORE DOES SHE THINK SHE IS LIVING WHEN SHE REMAINS IN THE SHADOW AND THERE IS SILENCE ROUND ABOUT HER BEAUTY HER BEAUTY ITSELF IS THE ADMIRING GLANCE OF HER LOVER
WHEN I WAS UNKNOWN TO YOU I GRADUALLY APPROACHED CLOSER AND CLOSER TO YOU UNTIL BUT LET US NOT GO INTO THE PAST LITTLE BY LITTLE MY LETTERS WILL BECOME LESS FREQUENT UNTIL THEY CEASE ALTOGETHER I WILL THUS DESCEND THE HILL THAT I HAVE BEEN CLIMBING FOR THE PAST YEAR
GOD HAS ESTABLISHED IT MAN DISCUSSES IT BUT OVER EVERY DOOR IS WRITTEN DO WHAT THOU WILT THOU SHALT DIE WHAT WILL BE SAID IF I KILL BRIGITTE NEITHER OF US WILL HEAR
WHO AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE WASTES LIFE IN IDLE REGRETS IF SHE SHOULD THINK OF DYING OF GRIEF THAT BEAUTIFUL BOSOM WOULD URGE HER TO LIVE AND HER GLASS WOULD PERSUADE HER AND THE DAY WHEN HER EXHAUSTED TEARS GIVE PLACE TO THE FIRST SMILE
I WAS BORN IN AN IMPIOUS CENTURY AND I HAVE MANY CRIMES TO EXPIATE THOU SON OF GOD WHOM MEN FORGET I HAVE NOT BEEN TAUGHT TO LOVE THEE I HAVE NEVER WORSHIPED IN THY TEMPLES BUT I THANK HEAVEN THAT WHERE I FIND THEE I TREMBLE AND BOW IN REVERENCE
YOU WILL TOUCH WITH YOUR LEFT HAND THE WOUNDS THAT YOU INFLICT WITH YOUR RIGHT YOU WILL MAKE A SHROUD OF YOUR VIRTUE IN WHICH TO BURY YOUR CRIMES
YOU WILL SPEAK OF YOUR YOUTH AND YOU WILL PERSUADE YOURSELF THAT HEAVEN OUGHT TO PARDON YOU THAT YOUR MISFORTUNES ARE INVOLUNTARY AND YOU WILL IMPLORE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS TO GRANT YOU A LITTLE REPOSE BUT WHO KNOWS YOU ARE STILL YOUNG
HE IS SEATED BEFORE AN ORGAN HIS WINGS ARE HALF FOLDED HIS HANDS EXTENDED OVER THE IVORY KEYS HE BEGINS AN ETERNAL HYMN THE HYMN OF LOVE AND IMMORTAL REST BUT HIS WINGS DROOP HIS HEAD FALLS OVER THE KEYS THE ANGEL OF DEATH HAS TOUCHED HIM ON THE SHOULDER
WHO HAD OFFENDED HER THEN INSULTED HER THEN ABANDONED HER ONLY TO TAKE HER BACK AGAIN TREMBLING WITH FEAR BESET WITH SUSPICION FINALLY THROWN ON THAT BED OF SORROW WHERE SHE NOW LAY EXTENDED WAS I
DO NOT ATTEND HER FUNERAL OBSEQUIES FOR FEAR THAT ON THE MORROW YOU WILL NOT BE CONSOLED TURN THE POIGNARD AGAINST YOUR OWN HEART WHILE THAT HEART YET LOVES THE GOD WHO MADE IT IS IT YOUR YOUTH THAT MAKES YOU PAUSE AND WOULD YOU SPARE THOSE YOUTHFUL LOCKS
I PICKED IT UP IT WAS A LETTER AND I RECOGNIZED BRIGITTE'S HAND THE ENVELOPE WAS NOT SEALED I OPENED IT AND READ AS FOLLOWS
YOU SAW A BETTER TIME SHINING IN THE FUTURE WHEN YOUR LIFE CONSECRATED TO THE OBJECT OF YOUR ADORATION GAVE PROMISE OF NEW STRENGTH AT THAT MOMENT THE ABYSS YAWNS BEFORE YOU
AND CONSEQUENTLY MY NERVES BEGAN TO EXHIBIT PALPABLE SIGNS OF DISTRESS WITH HER FIRST IMPERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT UPWARD A TREMBLING COMMENCED IN MY ARMS INCREASED AND EXTENDED RAPIDLY TO MY BODY AND LOWER EXTREMITIES
ARCHIBALD SIMS HAD RESIDED THERE ARCHIBALD HAD BEEN A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IN HIS DAY AND WHERE IS THE MAN OF HIS AGE IN GEORGIA WHO HAS NOT CONSEQUENTLY HE WAS CALLED SQUIRE SIMS IT IS THE CUSTOM IN THIS STATE WHEN A MAN HAS ONCE ACQUIRED A TITLE
I'LL BE BACK AGAIN THOUGH BY THE TIME SIME STOW SHOOTS
YOUR FATHER'S BET ON ME AT THE STORE HE WAS AT THE SHOOTING MATCH AND NOTHING COULD MAKE HIM BELIEVE BUT THAT I WAS A GREAT SHOT WITH A RIFLE AS WELL AS A SHOT GUN BET HE WOULD ON ME IN SPITE OF ALL I COULD SAY
GENTLEMEN SAID HE AS HE CAME TO THE MARK
AND FOR IT THE PAPER IS REDUCED TO ABOUT TWO AND A HALF INCHES SQUARE OUT OF THE CENTER OF IT IS CUT A RHOMBUS OF ABOUT THE WIDTH OF AN INCH MEASURED DIAGONALLY THIS IS THE BULL'S EYE OR DIAMOND AS THE MARKSMEN CHOOSE TO CALL IT IN THE CENTER OF THIS IS THE CROSS
NO ONE KNEW WHICH SENT DOWN THE BALL MEASURED THE CONTENTS OF HIS GUN WITH HIS FIRST AND SECOND FINGERS ON THE PROTRUDING PART OF THE RAMROD SHOOK HIS HEAD AGAIN TO SIGNIFY THERE WAS TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE POWDER PRIMED CAREFULLY PLACED AN ARCHED PIECE OF TIN OVER THE HIND SIGHT TO SHADE IT
WHAT IS IT THEN IT IS HALL SAID I
THE BEEF IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE PRIZES OR AS THEY ARE COMMONLY TERMED FIVE QUARTERS THE HIDE AND TALLOW COUNTING AS ONE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR A SIXTH WAS ADDED THE LEAD WHICH WAS SHOT IN THE MATCH
I NOW OF COURSE DETERMINED TO REVERSE THE MODE OF FIRING AND PUT FORTH ALL MY PHYSICAL ENERGIES TO RAISE SOAP STICK TO THE MARK THE EFFORT SILENCED BILLY AND GAVE TONGUE TO ALL HIS COMPANIONS I HAD JUST STRENGTH ENOUGH TO MASTER SOAP STICK'S OBSTINATE PROCLIVITY
ACCORDINGLY I COMMENCED LOWERING OLD SOAP STICK BUT IN SPITE OF ALL MY MUSCULAR POWERS SHE WAS STRICTLY OBEDIENT TO THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION AND CAME DOWN WITH A UNIFORMLY ACCELERATED VELOCITY BEFORE I COULD ARREST HER DOWNWARD FLIGHT
AND BILLY CURLEW TO WHOM WAS ADDED UPON THIS OCCASION BY COMMON CONSENT AND WITH AWFUL FOREBODINGS YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT THE TARGET WAS FIXED AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT THREE FEET FROM THE GROUND AND THE JUDGES CAPTAIN TURNER AND SQUIRE PORTER
THEIR EXPECTATIONS HAD RECEIVED ASSURANCE FROM THE COURTESY WHICH HAD BEEN EXTENDED TO ME AND NOTHING HAD HAPPENED TO DISAPPOINT THEM BUT THE SINGLE CAUTION TO THEM AGAINST THE DRY GRIPES WHICH WAS AS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN IN IRONY AS IN EARNEST
AND IT FLASHED LIKE ELECTRICITY AROUND THE TARGET AS I JUDGED FROM THE ANXIOUS GAZE OF ALL IN THAT DIRECTION POLICY DICTATED THAT I SHOULD FIRE WITH A FALLING RIFLE AND I ADOPTED THIS MODE DETERMINING TO FIRE AS SOON AS THE SIGHTS CAME ON A LINE WITH THE DIAMOND BEAD OR NO BEAD
OH YOU DIDN'T TAKE TIME SAID MEALY NO MAN CAN SHOOT THAT'S IN SUCH A HURRY AS YOU IS I'D HARDLY GOT TO SLEEP FORE I HEARD THE CRACK O THE GUN THE NEXT WAS MOSES FIRMBY
A GENERIC TERM WHICH IN THOSE DAYS EMBRACED THREE DESCRIPTIONS OF FIREARMS INDIAN TRADERS A LONG CHEAP BUT SOMETIMES EXCELLENT KIND OF GUN THAT MOTHER BRITAIN USED TO SEND HITHER FOR TRAFFIC WITH THE INDIANS
OH YES THERE IS STRANGER DO YOU SEE THIS HOLDING UP HIS PONDEROUS RIFLE WITH AN EASE THAT ASTONISHED ME
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNPARDONABLE TO DISAPPOINT THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED ON ME UNFORTUNATELY TOO FOR ME THE MATCH DIFFERED IN ONE RESPECT FROM THOSE WHICH I HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF ATTENDING IN MY YOUNGER DAYS IN OLDEN TIMES THE CONTEST WAS CARRIED ON CHIEFLY WITH SHOT GUNS
AND GIVE HIM THE PLEASURE OF AN EVENING'S CHAT ABOUT OLD TIMES HIS HOUSE SHOULD BE AS FREE TO ME AS MY OWN BUT I COULD NOT ACCEPT HIS HOSPITALITY WITHOUT RETRACING FIVE OR SIX MILES OF THE ROAD WHICH I HAD ALREADY PASSED AND THEREFORE I DECLINED IT WELL IF YOU WON'T GO
PRETTY DIGGING SAID HE I FIND YOU'RE NOT THE FOOL I TOOK YOU TO BE SO HERE'S TO A BETTER ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOU WITH ALL MY HEART RETURNED I BUT YOU MUST BE AS CLEVER AS I'VE BEEN AND GIVE ME YOUR NAME
HIRAM ASSUMED THE FIGURE OF A NOTE OF INTERROGATION TOOK A LONG SIGHT AND FIRED I'VE EAT PAPER SAID HE AT THE CRACK OF THE GUN WITHOUT LOOKING OR SEEMING TO LOOK TOWARD THE TARGET BUCK KILLER MADE A CLEAR RACKET
THAT I HAD ACCIDENTALLY FALLEN IN WITH BILLY CURLEW WHO BEGGED ME TO COME WITH HIM TO THE SHOOTING MATCH AND AS IT LAY RIGHT ON MY ROAD I HAD STOPPED OH SAID HE WITH A CONCILIATORY NOD IF YOU'RE UP FOR ANYTHING YOU NEEDN'T BE MEALY MOUTHED ABOUT IT FORE US BOYS
HE WAS BORN A SHOOTING AND KILLED SQUIRRELS BEFORE HE WAS WEANED NOR DID I EVER HEAR OF BUT ONE REPLIED I AND THAT ONE WAS MYSELF AND WHERE DID YOU WIN BEEF SO YOUNG STRANGER AT BERRY ADAMS'S
I DIDN'T KNOW SAID I BUT THAT YOU WERE GOING TO MEET THE HUNTSMEN OR GOING TO YOUR STAND AH SURE ENOUGH REJOINED HE THAT MOUT BE A BEE AS THE OLD WOMAN SAID WHEN SHE KILLED A WASP
AN'T YOU DRIV THE CROSS
AND IN THIS COURSE I RARELY FAIL TO PLEASE HOW'S THE OLD WOMAN
SAID BILLY AS THE SMOKE ROSE FROM BEFORE HIS EYE YOU'VE JIST TOUCHED THE CROSS ON THE LOWER SIDE WAS THE REPLY OF ONE OF THE JUDGES I WAS AFRAID I WAS DRAWING MY BEAD A LEETLE TOO FINE SAID BILLY NOW LYMAN YOU SEE WHAT THE SOAP STICK CAN DO
TO THIS I BELIEVE THEY USUALLY IF NOT INVARIABLY MEASURE WHERE NONE OF THE BALLS TOUCH THE CROSS BUT IF THE CROSS BE DRIVEN THEY MEASURE FROM IT TO THE CENTER OF THE BULLET HOLE
BUT IT ANSWERED THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS PUT WHICH WAS ONLY TO DRAW HIM INTO CONVERSATION
NEVER PRACTICED SHOOTING WITH THE DOUBLE WABBLE IT'S THE GREATEST TAKE IN THE WORLD WHEN YOU LEARN TO DRIVE THE CROSS WITH IT ANOTHER SORT FOR GETTING BETS UPON TO THE DROP SIGHT WITH A SINGLE WABBLE AND THE SOAP STICK'S THE VERY YARN FOR IT
SELECTED ONE WITHOUT FLAW OR WRINKLE DREW OUT HIS PATCHING FOUND THE MOST EVEN PART OF IT SPRUNG OPEN THE GREASE BOX IN THE BREECH OF HIS RIFLE TOOK UP JUST SO MUCH GREASE DISTRIBUTED IT WITH GREAT EQUALITY OVER THE CHOSEN PART OF HIS PATCHING LAID IT OVER THE MUZZLE OF HIS RIFLE
STRONG POINTS PERSONAL AMBITION ADAPTABILITY AND QUICK PHYSICAL ENERGY ARE THE STRONGEST POINTS OF THE THORACIC WEAKEST POINTS TOO GREAT EXCITABILITY IRRESPONSIBILITY AND SUPERSENSITIVENESS
YOUR QUICKNESS IF CALLED INTO COUNSEL WILL ENABLE YOU TO SEE FROM WHAT INSTINCTS YOUR MISTAKES HABITUALLY ARISE AND THE DIRECTION IN WHICH MOST OF THEM HAVE POINTED
EVEN YOUR DEAREST FRIENDS ARE SELDOM GIVEN A PEEP INTO THE ACTUAL YOU AND THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE THIS AS A DEFICIENCY IN OTHERS WE BOTTLE UP OURSELVES AND DEFY THE WORLD'S CORK SCREWS ALL SAVE THE THORACIC
SHE CAN'T SAID THE CAT MADE OF WORSTED SHE CAN'T COME TO YOU SHE HASN'T GOT ANY LEGS I KNOW IT I'M FIFTY YEARS OLD I NEVER SAW THEM NEVER MIND THE CAT SAID THE BOY LEANING AGAINST A GREYHOUND
AND THE PILLAR RETURNS THE COMPLIMENT WE DO NOT LIKE ANYTHING WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND AND WE SELDOM UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THAT DIFFERS DECIDEDLY FROM OURSELVES THUS WE DISTRUST AND DISLIKE FOREIGNERS AND TO A GREATER OR LESSER EXTENT OTHER FAMILIES
HE IS LIKELY TO TELL NOT ONLY HIS FAMILY BUT HIS NEWEST ACQUAINTANCES JUST WHAT HE IS PLANNING TO DO AND HOW HE EXPECTS TO DO IT THE NATURALLY SECRETIVE PERSON
SOCIAL ASSETS
WE LEAD SUCH DRAB LIVES OURSELVES AND KEEP BACK SO MUCH
NEVER FOUND IN OTHER TYPES HIS PLEASING VOICE
HE HAS A BETTER NATURAL START IN HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS THAN ANY OTHER TYPE SOCIAL LIABILITIES QUICK TEMPER HIS INFLAMMABLE NATURE AND APPEARANCES OF VANITY ARE HIS GREATEST SOCIAL LIABILITIES
SAID THE PARIAN GIRL I DON'T LIKE THAT WHY I HAVE PRIVATE REASONS WHAT NO MATTER I KNOW SAID THE CAT MADE OF WORSTED I SAW HER BEHIND SHE'S HOLLOW
LIKES RESPONSIVE PEOPLE WE ALL LIKE ANSWERS WE WANT TO BE ASSURED THAT WHAT WE HAVE SAID OR DONE HAS REGISTERED THE THORACIC IS ALWAYS SAYING OR DOING SOMETHING AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY OTHER PEOPLE ARE SO UNRESPONSIVE
I WILL TRY ANYTHING ONCE MANY COURSE DINNERS IF THE FOOD IS GOOD ARE ESPECIALLY POPULAR WITH THEM THE TRIMMINGS AT DINNER OUT OF THE ORDINARY SURROUNDINGS IN WHICH TO DINE ARE ALWAYS WELCOME TO THIS TYPE
AH CAME ANOTHER SIGH IT WAS FROM THE CHINA GIRL RISING OUT OF A PEN WIPER HOW I PITY YOU DO YOU SAID HE EAGERLY DO YOU THEN I LOVE YOU WILL YOU MARRY ME AH SAID SHE BUT
DEEP SEA DIVING AUTO RACING AND SIMILAR FIELDS HAS A STRONG APPEAL FOR THIS TYPE
IT WOULD BE A BEST SELLER NATURALLY CONFIDENTIAL PERSONAL EXPERIENCES PERSONAL SECRETS AND PERSONAL PREFERENCES ARE SUBJECTS WE ARE ALL INTERESTED IN
AND COULD GET UP WHEN HE WANTED TO WHEN THE PLAY BECAME TIRESOME AND GO OUT IT IS PAINFUL TO SAY SUCH THINGS OUT LOUD SAID THE BOY LEANING AGAINST A GREYHOUND WITH A TREMBLING VOICE
SAID THE STEADFAST BOY LEANING AGAINST A GREYHOUND AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE CAT GO AWAY SAID THE PARIAN GIRL ANGRILY YOU'RE ALL HATEFUL I WON'T HAVE YOU AH SIGHED THE BOY LEANING AGAINST A GREYHOUND
AND OF WASTING LESS ENERGY IN UNNECESSARY WORDS AND MOTIONS SHOULD AVOID ALL SITUATIONS CONDITIONS AND PEOPLE WHO SLIP THE BELT OFF THE WILL WHO TEND TO CUT LIFE UP INTO BITS BY DISSIPATION OR PLEASURE SEEKING
HE ALLOWS HIS ASSOCIATES TO SEE MUCH OF WHAT IS PASSING IN HIS MIND ALL THE TIME
FIFTY YEARS OLD IN FACT THERE WAS ANOTHER YOUNG PERSON THERE YOUNG LIKE THE BOY LEANING ON A GREYHOUND AND SHE TOO WAS OF PARIAN SHE WAS VERY FAIR IN FRONT BUT BEHIND AH
THAT IS A SECRET WHICH IS NOT QUITE TIME YET TO TELL ONE OTHER STOOD THERE AT LEAST SHE SEEMED TO STAND BUT NOBODY COULD SEE HER FEET FOR HER DRESS WAS SO VERY WIDE AND SO FINELY FLOUNCED
AS IN EVERYTHING ELSE AND WHAT HE BUYS WILL SERVE THAT END DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FASHION AND FLARE
AND PROCEEDS TO RUN THEM OFF FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT
THE THORACIC IS ALSO EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF DANCING ENJOYS VAUDEVILLE THE AVERAGE THORACIC ENJOYS VAUDEVILLE
THE THORACIC FINDS IT HARD TO MAINTAIN A GRUDGE BECAUSE HE GETS OVER IT JUST AS HE GETS OVER EVERYTHING ELSE
THE ALIMENTIVE LIKES LOTS OF RICH FOOD
AND A QUARREL COMES BETWEEN YOU HE MAY BE EVER SO BITTER AND BITING IN THE MOMENT OF HIS ANGER BUT IN MOST CASES HE WILL FORGIVE YOU EVENTUALLY REALLY FORGETS DISAGREEMENTS IT IS NOT AS EASY FOR OTHER TYPES TO FORGIVE
THE THORACIC MAKES OTHERS SEE AND FEEL WHAT HE DESCRIBES HE IS THEREFORE KNOWN AS THE MOST CHARMING CONVERSATIONALIST BEAUTIFUL VOICE
FOR HE KNOWS THAT THE REWARDS HE IS AFTER CAN NOT BE HAD BY THE DOWN AND OUTER THE NATURAL AND NORMAL VANITY OF THE THORACIC STANDS HIM IN HAND HERE MORE THAN IN ALMOST ANY OTHER PLACE IN LIFE THE WORLD ENTERTAINED BY THEM
HE WENT TO THE MANTEL PIECE AND TOOK UP THE CHINA GIRL RISING OUT OF A PEN WIPER WHY SHE HAS LEGS AFTER ALL SAID HE THEY'RE FALSE SAID THE CAT MADE OF WORSTED THEY'RE FALSE I KNOW IT I'M FIFTY YEARS OLD
NEVER MIND GO ON MY DEAR TO THE PARIAN GIRL WHAT
AND FINDS LIKE THE BOY RECOVERING FROM THE CHICKENPOX THAT HE SIMPLY HASN'T IT ANY MORE DISEASES HE IS MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO ACUTE DISEASES ARE THE ONES CHIEFLY AFFECTING THIS TYPE
WERE ALSO MISTRESSES OF SEVERAL LANGUAGES A WOMAN'S EDUCATION AT THIS TIME WAS NOT COMPLETE UNLESS SHE COULD WRITE LATIN AND SPEAK IT FLUENTLY THE AUTHOR OF THAT MOST INTERESTING EARLY ENGLISH WORK ANCREN RIWLE
AND RARE MENTAL ENDOWMENTS THEY RECALL THE BEST TRADITIONS OF A CORNELIA OR A CALPHURNIA WHILE SO GREAT WAS THEIR PURITY OF LIFE AND SO UNBOUNDED WAS THEIR CHARITY TO THE POOR AND SUFFERING THAT THEY WERE HONORED BY BEING NUMBERED AMONG THE SAINTS OF THE EARLY CHURCH
ONE REQUIRING KEENER CRITICAL SENSE OR MORE PROFOUND LEARNING THAN WERE PAULA AND EUSTOCHIUM OR ONE IN WHICH THEIR EFFORTS WERE CROWNED WITH MORE BRILLIANT SUCCESS THAN WERE THOSE OF THESE TWO SUPREME EXEMPLARS
RECEIVED CAEDMON INTO THE MONASTERY OF MONKS AND HAD HIM TRANSLATE THE ENTIRE BIBLE INTO ANGLO SAXON
WHOSE MINDS HAD HITHERTO BEEN CONFINED TO THE COMPARATIVELY BARREN FIELD OF ROMAN LETTERS THE SPLENDID CREATIONS OF GREEK GENIUS CAME AS A REVELATION TO BECOME THOROUGHLY VERSED IN GREEK POETRY AND PROFICIENT IN THE TEACHINGS OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY
OF WHOM MARTIAL WRITES LET EVERY GIRL WHOSE WISH IT IS TO PLEASE A SINGLE MAN READ SULPICIA LET EVERY MAN WHOSE WISH IT IS TO PLEASE A SINGLE MAID READ SULPICIA BUT IF THE FEW AMATORY VERSES THAT ARE CREDITED TO HER
OF THE GREEK MAIDEN WE ARE TOLD THAT BEFORE HER MARRIAGE SHE HAD BEEN MOST CAREFULLY BROUGHT UP TO SEE AND HEAR AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AND TO ASK THE FEWEST QUESTIONS THAT HER WHOLE EXPERIENCE BEFORE HER MARRIAGE
HOW MUCH OF THE LITERARY WORK OF THE WOMEN OF TO DAY WILL RECEIVE RECOGNITION TWENTY CENTURIES HENCE SOME OF IT MAY IT IS TRUE FIND A PLACE IN THE FIREPROOF LIBRARIES OF THE TIME BUT WHO OUTSIDE OF A FEW ANTIQUARIANS WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO READ IT
APART FROM THE INTEREST WHICH ATTACHES TO CAEDMON FROM A HISTORICAL AND LITERARY POINT OF VIEW HIS LIFE DISCLOSES TO US ESSENTIAL PECULIARITIES IN THE OUTWARD ORGANIZATION
AND WAS TREATED RATHER AS THE PEER AND COMPANION OF MAN THAN AS HIS TOY OR HIS SLAVE BESIDES THIS FOREIGN WOMEN WERE NEVER SO CONSPICUOUS IN ROME AS IN ATHENS EVEN AFTER GREECE HAD BECOME A ROMAN PROVINCE
AND AFTER GRAECIA CAPTA ROMAM CEPIT WHEN GREEK IDEAS AND GREEK CUSTOMS WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE CAPITAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD IT WAS STILL THE ROMAN MATRON THAT WAS SUPREME AND ALTHOUGH MANY GREEK WOMEN SOME OF THEM OF RARE BEAUTY AND CULTURE
FAR MORE NOTABLE HOWEVER THAN THE CONVENTS OF ARLES AND POITIERS WAS THE CELEBRATED CONVENT OF SAINT HILDA AT WHITBY HILDA THE FOUNDRESS AND FIRST ABBESS OF WHITBY WAS A PRINCESS OF THE BLOOD ROYAL
CONSISTED IN KNOWING HOW TO TAKE THE WOOL AND MAKE A DRESS AND IN SEEING HOW HER MOTHER'S HANDMAIDENS HAD THEIR DAILY SPINNING TASKS ASSIGNED TO THEM CORNELIA ON THE CONTRARY WAS NOT ONLY AS WE HAVE SEEN HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED
WHEN THEY ARE ACCORDED THE NECESSARY FREEDOM OF ACTION AND WHEN THEY ARE PROPERLY EQUIPPED FOR WORK BY EDUCATION AND BY ASSOCIATION WITH MEN OF LEARNING AND EXPERIENCE COMPARING THE SECLUDED AND ILLITERATE GREEK WIFE
SHE WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO HAVE REACHED THE AGE OF REASON OR EXPERIENCE AND HER NOBLEST EPITAPH IT WAS AVERRED WAS COUCHED IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS SHE WAS GENTLE PIOUS LOVED HER HUSBAND WAS SKILLFUL AT THE LOOM
AND AS FOR MEN OF THE OLD CONSERVATIVE TYPE A LEARNED WOMAN WAS AS MUCH AN OBJECT OF HORROR AS IS A MILITANT SUFFRAGETTE IN CONSERVATIVE ENGLAND TO DAY
BY DEDICATING TO THEM A GREAT NUMBER OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS
AND BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT THE WONDERFUL ADVANCE THAT HAD BEEN MADE IN THE GENERAL STATUS OF WOMEN SINCE THE DAYS OF PERICLES AND ASPASIA I HAVE REFERRED TO THEM ALSO
THERE WERE CENTERS OF CULTURE IN ONE PART OF EUROPE OR ANOTHER AT ONE TIME THE CENTER WAS IN ITALY AT ANOTHER IN GAUL AND AT STILL ANOTHER IT WAS IN BRITAIN OR IRELAND OR GERMANY BUT WHETHER IT WAS IN THE SOUTH
AND RESENTED PARTICULARLY THE PREEMINENCE GIVEN TO PAULA AND HER ACCOMPLISHED DAUGHTER BUT THEIR REPROACHES PROVOKED A REPLY FROM THE SAINT THAT WAS WORTHY OF THE MOST CHIVALROUS CHAMPION OF WOMAN AND REVEALED AT THE SAME TIME
HAD SO IMPRESSED HER FELLOW CITIZENS BY HER INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITY THAT SHE WAS CHOSEN AS ONE OF THE TWO CHIEF MAGISTRATES OF THE PLACE SHE IS KNOWN IN HISTORY AS MESSIA CASTULA
AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE ANGLO SAXON NUNS JUST MENTIONED IT IS EVIDENT THAT THEY WERE OF A TRUTH WOMEN OF EXCEPTIONAL WORTH AND OF STERLING CHARACTER AND IT IS EQUALLY CLEAR
AND SO ELOQUENT AND EFFECTIVE WAS HER SPEECH THAT SHE NOT ONLY WON HER CASE BUT ALSO WON THE PRAISE OF THE CRITIC QUINTILIAN FOR HER SPLENDID ORATORICAL EFFORT YET MORE A CERTAIN WOMAN IN THE ROMAN POSSESSIONS IN AFRICA
THE WIFE OF GERMANICUS IN MANY RESPECTS SHE WAS THE MOST COMMANDING PERSONALITY OF HER AGE AND EXHIBITED IN AN EMINENT DEGREE THOSE STERLING QUALITIES WHICH WE ARE WONT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE STRONG DIGNIFIED COURAGEOUS WOMEN OF ANCIENT ROME
WHICH THE GREAT MAN ACCEPTED WITH TOUCHING HUMILITY AND INCORPORATED IN A REVISED COPY MORE WONDERFUL STILL THE LATIN PSALTER AS IT HAS COME DOWN TO US IS NOT AS IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED
OF THE GRACE THE KNOWLEDGE THE CULTURE THE REFINEMENT OF ROMAN WOMANHOOD THE CROWNING GLORIES OF WOMANHOOD THROUGHOUT THE AGES SAINT JEROME SHOWED HIS GRATEFUL RECOGNITION OF THE INVALUABLE ASSISTANCE RECEIVED FROM HIS DEVOTED AND TALENTED CO WORKERS
IN ALL THINGS MORE COMPARABLE TO THE GODS THAN TO MEN
FOR IT IS PROBABLE THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR INFLUENCE ON JEROME AND THEIR ACTIVE COOPERATION IN HIS GREAT LIFE WORK WE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE LATIN VERSION OF THE SCRIPTURES THAT IS TO DAY KNOWN AS THE VULGATE THIS IS EVINCED FROM THE LETTERS OF THE SAINT HIMSELF
THE FORMER DESIGNATION SEEMS PREFERABLE FOR AS WE SHALL SEE THE LATTER IS MORE OR LESS MISLEADING DURING THE WANDERING OF THE NATIONS IN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES AND THE LONG AND FIERCE STRUGGLES BETWEEN THE BARBARIAN HORDES FROM THE NORTH
