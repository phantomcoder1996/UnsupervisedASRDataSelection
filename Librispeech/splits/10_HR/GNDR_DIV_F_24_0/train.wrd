THERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDREN
FOR TEN TO ONE WHETHER YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN YOU SHOULD NEVER FRET ABOUT TRIFLES AFTER A SHORT SILENCE I HOPE MY CATHERINE YOU ARE NOT GETTING OUT OF HUMOUR WITH HOME BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO GRAND AS NORTHANGER
WHO OWNED THE CHIEF OF THE PROPERTY ABOUT FULLERTON THE VILLAGE IN WILTSHIRE WHERE THE MORLANDS LIVED WAS ORDERED TO BATH FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GOUTY CONSTITUTION AND HIS LADY A GOOD HUMOURED WOMAN FOND OF MISS MORLAND AND PROBABLY AWARE THAT IF
SOME EXPLANATION ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT HE HAD TO GIVE BUT HIS FIRST PURPOSE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND BEFORE THEY REACHED MISTER ALLEN'S GROUNDS HE HAD DONE IT SO WELL THAT CATHERINE DID NOT THINK IT COULD EVER BE REPEATED TOO OFTEN
AND ON DEVELOPING FROM AMIDST ALL HER PERPLEXITY OF WORDS IN REPLY THE MEANING WHICH ONE SHORT SYLLABLE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO THEM AND
THAT WOULD BE TURNING YOUR VISIT INTO AN EVIL INDEED WHEREVER YOU ARE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONTENTED BUT ESPECIALLY AT HOME BECAUSE THERE YOU MUST SPEND THE MOST OF YOUR TIME I DID NOT QUITE LIKE AT BREAKFAST
HAD BEEN THE ONLY CAUSE OF GIVING HER A SERIOUS THOUGHT IT IS A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE IN ROMANCE I ACKNOWLEDGE AND DREADFULLY DEROGATORY OF AN HEROINE'S DIGNITY BUT IF IT BE AS NEW IN COMMON LIFE
BESTOWING A RICH AUNT AND SINKING HALF THE CHILDREN HE WAS ABLE TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE FAMILY TO THE GENERAL IN A MOST RESPECTABLE LIGHT FOR CATHERINE HOWEVER THE PECULIAR OBJECT OF THE GENERAL'S CURIOSITY
AND HE KNEW THE YOUNG MAN ON WHOM THE FULLERTON ESTATE MUST DEVOLVE THE GENERAL NEEDED NO MORE ENRAGED WITH ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD BUT HIMSELF HE SET OUT THE NEXT DAY FOR THE ABBEY WHERE HIS PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN SEEN
THIS LITTLE WORK WAS FINISHED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN O THREE AND INTENDED FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION IT WAS DISPOSED OF TO A BOOKSELLER IT WAS EVEN ADVERTISED
APPLIED TO HER WORK BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES SUNK AGAIN WITHOUT KNOWING IT HERSELF INTO LANGUOR AND LISTLESSNESS MOVING HERSELF IN HER CHAIR FROM THE IRRITATION OF WEARINESS MUCH OFTENER THAN SHE MOVED HER NEEDLE
NOTHING TO LAY TO HER CHARGE BUT HER BEING THE INVOLUNTARY UNCONSCIOUS OBJECT OF A DECEPTION WHICH HIS PRIDE COULD NOT PARDON AND WHICH A BETTER PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO OWN
OF MISS MORLAND'S BEING UNDER THEIR CARE AND AS SOON AS HIS ACQUAINTANCE ALLOWED HIM TO JUDGE OF THEIR TREATING HER WITH PARENTAL KINDNESS HIS RESOLUTION WAS SOON FORMED
HE STEADILY REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIS FATHER INTO HEREFORDSHIRE AN ENGAGEMENT FORMED ALMOST AT THE MOMENT TO PROMOTE THE DISMISSAL OF CATHERINE AND AS STEADILY DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF OFFERING HER HIS HAND
MISSUS MORLAND HAD BEEN ALWAYS KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS EACH AND INSTANTLY PLEASED BY HIS APPEARANCE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE SIMPLE PROFESSIONS OF UNAFFECTED BENEVOLENCE THANKING HIM FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION TO HER DAUGHTER
UPON SUCH INTELLIGENCE THE GENERAL HAD PROCEEDED FOR NEVER HAD IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO DOUBT ITS AUTHORITY THORPE'S INTEREST IN THE FAMILY BY HIS SISTER'S APPROACHING CONNECTION WITH ONE OF ITS MEMBERS
THIS WAS STRANGE INDEED BUT STRANGE THINGS MAY BE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR IF THEIR CAUSE BE FAIRLY SEARCHED OUT THERE WAS NOT ONE LORD IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NO NOT EVEN A BARONET
SUCH WAS THE PERMISSION UPON WHICH HE HAD NOW OFFERED HER HIS HAND THE AFFRIGHTED CATHERINE AMIDST ALL THE TERRORS OF EXPECTATION AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS ACCOUNT
LIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT SMILING AT GRIEF SO FAR HER IMPROVEMENT WAS SUFFICIENT AND IN MANY OTHER POINTS SHE CAME ON EXCEEDINGLY WELL FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT WRITE SONNETS
THE CREDIT OF A WILD IMAGINATION WILL AT LEAST BE ALL MY OWN A VERY SHORT VISIT TO MISSUS ALLEN IN WHICH HENRY TALKED AT RANDOM WITHOUT SENSE OR CONNECTION AND CATHERINE
HER ABILITIES WERE QUITE AS EXTRAORDINARY SHE NEVER COULD LEARN OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BEFORE SHE WAS TAUGHT AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THEN FOR SHE WAS OFTEN INATTENTIVE AND OCCASIONALLY STUPID
AND BEING AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN DAILY EXPECTATION OF MORLAND'S ENGAGING ISABELLA BUT LIKEWISE PRETTY WELL RESOLVED UPON MARRYING CATHERINE HIMSELF
SHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEM
NO OPPOSING DESIRE THAT SHOULD DARE TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN WORDS COULD ILL BROOK THE OPPOSITION OF HIS SON STEADY AS THE SANCTION OF REASON AND THE DICTATE OF CONSCIENCE COULD MAKE IT BUT IN SUCH A CAUSE HIS ANGER
HER GREATEST DEFICIENCY WAS IN THE PENCIL SHE HAD NO NOTION OF DRAWING NOT ENOUGH EVEN TO ATTEMPT A SKETCH OF HER LOVER'S PROFILE THAT SHE MIGHT BE DETECTED IN THE DESIGN
HIS VANITY INDUCED HIM TO REPRESENT THE FAMILY AS YET MORE WEALTHY THAN HIS VANITY AND AVARICE HAD MADE HIM BELIEVE THEM WITH WHOMSOEVER HE WAS OR WAS LIKELY TO BE CONNECTED
AND HIS OWN VIEWS ON ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH HE BOASTED WITH ALMOST EQUAL OPENNESS SEEMED SUFFICIENT VOUCHERS FOR HIS TRUTH AND TO THESE WERE ADDED THE ABSOLUTE FACTS OF THE ALLENS BEING WEALTHY AND CHILDLESS
CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY
IN WHAT POINTS HIS OWN CONJECTURES MIGHT ASSIST HIM AND WHAT PORTION MUST YET REMAIN TO BE TOLD IN A LETTER FROM JAMES
HER LOVE OF DIRT GAVE WAY TO AN INCLINATION FOR FINERY AND SHE GREW CLEAN AS SHE GREW SMART SHE HAD NOW THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES HEARING HER FATHER AND MOTHER REMARK ON HER PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT
AND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES
NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE
WHERE THERE ARE HEADS AND ARMS AND LEGS ENOUGH FOR THE NUMBER BUT THE MORLANDS HAD LITTLE OTHER RIGHT TO THE WORD FOR THEY WERE IN GENERAL VERY PLAIN AND CATHERINE FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE AS PLAIN AS ANY
HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER
FOR MISSUS MORLAND THINKING IT PROBABLE AS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IN HIS WISH OF WAITING ON THEIR WORTHY NEIGHBOURS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO GIVE OF HIS FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR
BUT WHEN A THIRD NIGHT'S REST HAD NEITHER RESTORED HER CHEERFULNESS IMPROVED HER IN USEFUL ACTIVITY NOR GIVEN HER A GREATER INCLINATION FOR NEEDLEWORK SHE COULD NO LONGER REFRAIN FROM THE GENTLE REPROOF OF
DESIROUS OF MISTER MORLAND'S ASSISTANCE AS WELL IN GIVING ENCOURAGEMENT AS IN FINDING CONVERSATION FOR HER GUEST WHOSE EMBARRASSMENT ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT SHE EARNESTLY PITIED
WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER AS MISTER HENRY TILNEY WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY
CATHERINE AT ANY RATE HEARD ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT IN SUSPECTING GENERAL TILNEY OF EITHER MURDERING OR SHUTTING UP HIS WIFE SHE HAD SCARCELY SINNED AGAINST HIS CHARACTER OR MAGNIFIED HIS CRUELTY
SHE KNEW NOT THAT A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES TILL ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST OBJECT SHE BEHELD WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
SCARCELY OPENED HER LIPS DISMISSED THEM TO THE ECSTASIES OF ANOTHER TETE A TETE AND BEFORE IT WAS SUFFERED TO CLOSE SHE WAS ENABLED TO JUDGE HOW FAR HE WAS SANCTIONED BY PARENTAL AUTHORITY IN HIS PRESENT APPLICATION
THOUGH HIS HEART WAS GREATLY RELIEVED BY SUCH UNLOOKED FOR MILDNESS IT WAS NOT JUST AT THAT MOMENT IN HIS POWER TO SAY ANYTHING TO THE PURPOSE RETURNING IN SILENCE TO HIS SEAT THEREFORE
AND RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO BOOKS OR AT LEAST BOOKS OF INFORMATION FOR PROVIDED THAT NOTHING LIKE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE COULD BE GAINED FROM THEM PROVIDED THEY WERE ALL STORY AND NO REFLECTION
THAT THE POOR BEETLE WHICH WE TREAD UPON IN CORPORAL SUFFERANCE FEELS A PANG AS GREAT AS WHEN A GIANT DIES AND THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IN LOVE ALWAYS LOOKS
AND THANKFUL FOR MISTER THORPE'S COMMUNICATION HE ALMOST INSTANTLY DETERMINED TO SPARE NO PAINS IN WEAKENING HIS BOASTED INTEREST AND RUINING HIS DEAREST HOPES
HAD SEEN WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SUDDENNESS CONTINUANCE AND EXTENT OF HIS ATTENTION AND THOUGH LATTERLY FROM SOME HINTS WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED AN ALMOST POSITIVE COMMAND TO HIS SON OF DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO ATTACH HER
AS HE HAD LATELY HAD PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITIES OF DISCOVERING AIMING AT A STYLE OF LIFE WHICH THEIR FORTUNE COULD NOT WARRANT SEEKING TO BETTER THEMSELVES BY WEALTHY CONNECTIONS A FORWARD BRAGGING SCHEMING RACE
HAD ACCIDENTALLY INQUIRED OF THORPE IF HE KNEW MORE OF HER THAN HER NAME THORPE MOST HAPPY TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A MAN OF GENERAL TILNEY'S IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN JOYFULLY AND PROUDLY COMMUNICATIVE
I LEAVE IT TO MY READER'S SAGACITY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF ALL THIS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HENRY TO COMMUNICATE AT THIS TIME TO CATHERINE HOW MUCH OF IT HE COULD HAVE LEARNT FROM HIS FATHER
HENRY WAS CONVINCED OF HIS FATHER'S BELIEVING IT TO BE AN ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION IT WAS NOT TILL THE LATE EXPLANATION AT NORTHANGER THAT THEY HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF THE FALSE CALCULATIONS WHICH HAD HURRIED HIM ON
FRENCH BY HER MOTHER HER PROFICIENCY IN EITHER WAS NOT REMARKABLE AND SHE SHIRKED HER LESSONS IN BOTH WHENEVER SHE COULD WHAT A STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE CHARACTER FOR WITH ALL THESE SYMPTOMS OF PROFLIGACY AT TEN YEARS OLD
COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REJECTION BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
HATED CONFINEMENT AND CLEANLINESS AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN AT FIFTEEN APPEARANCES WERE MENDING
CATHERINE TOOK UP HER WORK DIRECTLY SAYING IN A DEJECTED VOICE THAT HER HEAD DID NOT RUN UPON BATH MUCH THEN YOU ARE FRETTING ABOUT GENERAL TILNEY AND THAT IS VERY SIMPLE OF YOU
TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT NORTHANGER I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT I EAT THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH SUCH A SUBJECT
HER INTIMACY THERE HAD MADE HIM SERIOUSLY DETERMINE ON HER BEING HANDSOMELY LEGACIED HEREAFTER AND TO SPEAK OF HER THEREFORE AS THE ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGED FUTURE HEIRESS OF FULLERTON NATURALLY FOLLOWED
HIS OWN CONSEQUENCE ALWAYS REQUIRED THAT THEIRS SHOULD BE GREAT AND AS HIS INTIMACY WITH ANY ACQUAINTANCE GREW SO REGULARLY GREW THEIR FORTUNE THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS FRIEND MORLAND THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST OVERRATED
HER MOTHER WAS THREE MONTHS IN TEACHING HER ONLY TO REPEAT THE BEGGAR'S PETITION AND AFTER ALL HER NEXT SISTER SALLY COULD SAY IT BETTER THAN SHE DID NOT THAT CATHERINE WAS ALWAYS STUPID BY NO MEANS
SO AT EIGHT YEARS OLD SHE BEGAN SHE LEARNT A YEAR AND COULD NOT BEAR IT AND MISSUS MORLAND WHO DID NOT INSIST ON HER DAUGHTERS BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN SPITE OF INCAPACITY OR DISTASTE ALLOWED HER TO LEAVE OFF
NORTHANGER ABBEY
WITHOUT HAVING SEEN ONE AMIABLE YOUTH WHO COULD CALL FORTH HER SENSIBILITY WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED ONE REAL PASSION AND WITHOUT HAVING EXCITED EVEN ANY ADMIRATION BUT WHAT WAS VERY MODERATE AND VERY TRANSIENT
AND SPURNING A FRIENDSHIP WHICH COULD BE NO LONGER SERVICEABLE HASTENED TO CONTRADICT ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MORLANDS CONFESSED HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN TOTALLY MISTAKEN IN HIS OPINION OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND CHARACTER
WHICH IT MUST BE MORE PLEASANT FOR HIM TO COMMUNICATE ONLY TO CATHERINE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PREVENT HER ACCOMPANYING HIM THEY BEGAN THEIR WALK AND MISSUS MORLAND WAS NOT ENTIRELY MISTAKEN IN HIS OBJECT IN WISHING IT
HAD EVER SINCE HIS INTRODUCTION TO ISABELLA BEEN GRADUALLY INCREASING AND BY MERELY ADDING TWICE AS MUCH FOR THE GRANDEUR OF THE MOMENT BY DOUBLING WHAT HE CHOSE TO THINK THE AMOUNT OF MISTER MORLAND'S PREFERMENT TREBLING HIS PRIVATE FORTUNE
CHAPTER THIRTY CATHERINE'S DISPOSITION WAS NOT NATURALLY SEDENTARY NOR HAD HER HABITS BEEN EVER VERY INDUSTRIOUS BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HITHERTO HAVE BEEN HER DEFECTS OF THAT SORT
THE TERRIFIED GENERAL PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF ALLEN WITH AN INQUIRING LOOK AND HERE TOO THORPE HAD LEARNT HIS ERROR THE ALLENS HE BELIEVED HAD LIVED NEAR THEM TOO LONG
JOHN THORPE HAD FIRST MISLED HIM THE GENERAL PERCEIVING HIS SON ONE NIGHT AT THE THEATRE TO BE PAYING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO MISS MORLAND
THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY WHO WAS SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND
ON HIS RETURN FROM WOODSTON TWO DAYS BEFORE HE HAD BEEN MET NEAR THE ABBEY BY HIS IMPATIENT FATHER HASTILY INFORMED IN ANGRY TERMS OF MISS MORLAND'S DEPARTURE AND ORDERED TO THINK OF HER NO MORE
AND HIS OWN SPECULATIONS HE HAD YET SOMETHING MORE IN RESERVE AND THE TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HER FATHER COULD GIVE HER WOULD BE A PRETTY ADDITION TO MISTER ALLEN'S ESTATE
IRRITATED BY CATHERINE'S REFUSAL AND YET MORE BY THE FAILURE OF A VERY RECENT ENDEAVOUR TO ACCOMPLISH A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN MORLAND AND ISABELLA CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOREVER
CATHERINE HERSELF COULD NOT BE MORE IGNORANT AT THE TIME OF ALL THIS THAN HIS OWN CHILDREN HENRY AND ELEANOR PERCEIVING NOTHING IN HER SITUATION LIKELY TO ENGAGE THEIR FATHER'S PARTICULAR RESPECT
BUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY MISTER ALLEN
MISSUS MORLAND HAD VERY EARLY DISPATCHED ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO SUMMON HIM BUT MISTER MORLAND WAS FROM HOME AND BEING THUS WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS IN HIS ANGER AND THEY PARTED IN DREADFUL DISAGREEMENT HENRY IN AN AGITATION OF MIND WHICH MANY SOLITARY HOURS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPOSE
BUT HER GLOWING CHEEK AND BRIGHTENED EYE MADE HER MOTHER TRUST THAT THIS GOOD NATURED VISIT WOULD AT LEAST SET HER HEART AT EASE FOR A TIME AND GLADLY THEREFORE DID SHE LAY ASIDE THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE MIRROR FOR A FUTURE HOUR
BEEN CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF GIVING THE YOUNG PEOPLE EVEN A DECENT SUPPORT THEY WERE IN FACT A NECESSITOUS FAMILY NUMEROUS TOO ALMOST BEYOND EXAMPLE BY NO MEANS RESPECTED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
AND DELIGHTED IN ALL THE EXCELLENCIES OF HER CHARACTER AND TRULY LOVED HER SOCIETY I MUST CONFESS THAT HIS AFFECTION ORIGINATED IN NOTHING BETTER THAN GRATITUDE OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT A PERSUASION OF HER PARTIALITY FOR HIM
THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACK
NOT MERELY TO DOLLS BUT TO THE MORE HEROIC ENJOYMENTS OF INFANCY NURSING A DORMOUSE FEEDING A CANARY BIRD OR WATERING A ROSE BUSH INDEED SHE HAD NO TASTE FOR A GARDEN
MY DEAR CATHERINE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GROWING QUITE A FINE LADY I DO NOT KNOW WHEN POOR RICHARD'S CRAVATS WOULD BE DONE IF HE HAD NO FRIEND BUT YOU YOUR HEAD RUNS TOO MUCH UPON BATH
THERE SHE FELL MISERABLY SHORT OF THE TRUE HEROIC HEIGHT AT PRESENT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER OWN POVERTY FOR SHE HAD NO LOVER TO PORTRAY SHE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN
AND DESIGNED HER FOR HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ON DISCOVERING HIS ERROR TO TURN HER FROM THE HOUSE SEEMED THE BEST THOUGH TO HIS FEELINGS AN INADEQUATE PROOF OF HIS RESENTMENT TOWARDS HERSELF AND HIS CONTEMPT OF HER FAMILY
AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES UNBROKEN SILENCE HENRY TURNING TO CATHERINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HER MOTHER'S ENTRANCE ASKED HER WITH SUDDEN ALACRITY IF MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN WERE NOW AT FULLERTON
SHE LEARNT THE FABLE OF THE HARE AND MANY FRIENDS AS QUICKLY AS ANY GIRL IN ENGLAND HER MOTHER WISHED HER TO LEARN MUSIC AND CATHERINE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD LIKE IT FOR SHE WAS VERY FOND OF TINKLING THE KEYS OF THE OLD FORLORN SPINNET
THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM AT NORTHANGER HAD BEEN OF THE MOST UNFRIENDLY KIND HENRY'S INDIGNATION ON HEARING HOW CATHERINE HAD BEEN TREATED ON COMPREHENDING HIS FATHER'S VIEWS AND BEING ORDERED TO ACQUIESCE IN THEM
AND BELIEVING THAT HEART TO BE HIS OWN WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO GAIN NO UNWORTHY RETRACTION OF A TACIT CONSENT
HER MOTHER COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THEM NOW TO BE GREATLY INCREASED SHE COULD NEITHER SIT STILL NOR EMPLOY HERSELF FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER WALKING ROUND THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF NOTHING BUT MOTION WAS VOLUNTARY
MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR FROM THOMPSON THAT IT IS A DELIGHTFUL TASK TO TEACH THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOT
ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW HIM THE WAY YOU MAY SEE THE HOUSE FROM THIS WINDOW SIR WAS INFORMATION ON SARAH'S SIDE WHICH PRODUCED ONLY A BOW OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE GENTLEMAN AND A SILENCING NOD FROM HER MOTHER
DARK LANK HAIR AND STRONG FEATURES SO MUCH FOR HER PERSON AND NOT LESS UNPROPITIOUS FOR HEROISM SEEMED HER MIND SHE WAS FOND OF ALL BOY'S PLAYS AND GREATLY PREFERRED CRICKET
MISLED BY THE RHODOMONTADE OF HIS FRIEND TO BELIEVE HIS FATHER A MAN OF SUBSTANCE AND CREDIT WHEREAS THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE TWO OR THREE LAST WEEKS PROVED HIM TO BE NEITHER
HAD BEEN OPEN AND BOLD THE GENERAL ACCUSTOMED ON EVERY ORDINARY OCCASION TO GIVE THE LAW IN HIS FAMILY PREPARED FOR NO RELUCTANCE BUT OF FEELING
AND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD EVEN WALK ABOUT THE HOUSE RATHER THAN REMAIN FIXED FOR ANY TIME IN THE PARLOUR HER LOSS OF SPIRITS WAS A YET GREATER ALTERATION IN HER RAMBLING AND HER IDLENESS
SHE BROUGHT HERSELF TO READ THEM AND THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF HER THROWING A WHOLE PARTY INTO RAPTURES BY A PRELUDE ON THE PIANOFORTE OF HER OWN COMPOSITION SHE COULD LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE WITH VERY LITTLE FATIGUE
THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER HER OWN PERSON AND DISPOSITION WERE ALL EQUALLY AGAINST HER HER FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN WITHOUT BEING NEGLECTED OR POOR AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN
HENRY IN HAVING SUCH THINGS TO RELATE OF HIS FATHER WAS ALMOST AS PITIABLE AS IN THEIR FIRST AVOWAL TO HIMSELF HE BLUSHED FOR THE NARROW MINDED COUNSEL WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO EXPOSE
THAT THEY WERE FALSE THE GENERAL HAD LEARNT FROM THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD SUGGESTED THEM FROM THORPE HIMSELF WHOM HE HAD CHANCED TO MEET AGAIN IN TOWN AND WHO UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXACTLY OPPOSITE FEELINGS
SHE HAD NEVER ANY OBJECTION TO BOOKS AT ALL BUT FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SHE WAS IN TRAINING FOR A HEROINE SHE READ ALL SUCH WORKS AS HEROINES MUST READ TO SUPPLY THEIR MEMORIES WITH THOSE QUOTATIONS WHICH ARE SO SERVICEABLE
THE PUBLIC ARE ENTREATED TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE IT WAS FINISHED MANY MORE SINCE IT WAS BEGUN AND THAT DURING THAT PERIOD PLACES MANNERS BOOKS AND OPINIONS HAVE UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE CHANGES
ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOILT FOR HOME BY GREAT ACQUAINTANCE THE MIRROR I THINK I WILL LOOK IT OUT FOR YOU SOME DAY OR OTHER BECAUSE I AM SURE IT WILL DO YOU GOOD CATHERINE SAID NO MORE AND WITH AN ENDEAVOUR TO DO RIGHT
SHE HAD A THIN AWKWARD FIGURE
SHE BEGAN TO CURL HER HAIR AND LONG FOR BALLS HER COMPLEXION IMPROVED HER FEATURES WERE SOFTENED BY PLUMPNESS AND COLOUR HER EYES GAINED MORE ANIMATION AND HER FIGURE MORE CONSEQUENCE
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED ERE SHE RETURNED DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE VOLUME FROM WHICH SO MUCH WAS HOPED HER AVOCATIONS ABOVE HAVING SHUT OUT ALL NOISE BUT WHAT SHE CREATED HERSELF
BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS APPEARANCE THERE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED HE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO EXPECT A WELCOME AT FULLERTON AND STATING HIS IMPATIENCE TO BE ASSURED OF MISS MORLAND'S HAVING REACHED HER HOME IN SAFETY
AS THE CAUSE OF HIS INTRUSION HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIMSELF TO AN UNCANDID JUDGE OR A RESENTFUL HEART FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HIM OR HIS SISTER IN THEIR FATHER'S MISCONDUCT
AND FROM SHAKESPEARE SHE GAINED A GREAT STORE OF INFORMATION AMONGST THE REST THAT TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR ARE TO THE JEALOUS CONFIRMATION STRONG AS PROOFS OF HOLY WRIT
THAN A BEAUTY FROM HER CRADLE CAN EVER RECEIVE MISSUS MORLAND WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN AND WISHED TO SEE HER CHILDREN EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE BUT HER TIME WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED IN LYING IN AND TEACHING THE LITTLE ONES
FOR AFTER COMING EAGERLY FORWARD ON THE FIRST OVERTURE OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WITH THE MOST LIBERAL PROPOSALS HE HAD ON BEING BROUGHT TO THE POINT BY THE SHREWDNESS OF THE RELATOR
HER MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF USEFUL PLAIN SENSE WITH A GOOD TEMPER AND WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE WITH A GOOD CONSTITUTION SHE HAD THREE SONS BEFORE CATHERINE WAS BORN
THAT I SHALL NOT TELL YOU SAID THE GARTER
ALICE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THIS IT WASN'T AT ALL LIKE CONVERSATION SHE THOUGHT AS HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO HER IN FACT HIS LAST REMARK WAS
YOU'RE SO EXACTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE THE FACE IS WHAT ONE GOES BY GENERALLY ALICE REMARKED IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE THAT'S JUST WHAT I COMPLAIN OF
THEN CAME THE WARM BOX IRON
HE SAID I'D GO AND WAKE THEM IF I TOOK A CORKSCREW FROM THE SHELF I WENT TO WAKE THEM UP MYSELF AND WHEN I FOUND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED I PULLED AND PUSHED
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
HUMPTY DUMPTY WENT ON WAGGING HIS HEAD GRAVELY FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR TO GET THEIR WAGES YOU KNOW ALICE DIDN'T VENTURE TO ASK WHAT HE PAID THEM WITH
WITH A KIND OF SNEEZE IN THE MIDDLE HOWEVER YOU'LL HEAR IT DONE MAYBE DOWN IN THE WOOD YONDER AND WHEN YOU'VE ONCE HEARD IT YOU'LL BE QUITE CONTENT
YES ALL HIS HORSES AND ALL HIS MEN HUMPTY DUMPTY WENT ON THEY'D PICK ME UP AGAIN IN A MINUTE THEY WOULD HOWEVER
LET'S GO BACK TO THE LAST REMARK BUT ONE I'M AFRAID I CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER IT ALICE SAID VERY POLITELY IN THAT CASE WE START FRESH
HE WENT ON WITHOUT NOTICING HER REMARK WAS WRITTEN ENTIRELY FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT
I SEE WELL THAT YOU ARE BOTH FOR USE AND ORNAMENT
CLEARLY THAT IT WAS HUMPTY DUMPTY HIMSELF IT CAN'T BE ANYBODY ELSE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I'M AS CERTAIN OF IT
GYROSCOPE TO GIMBLE
IT'S VERY PROVOKING HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID AFTER A LONG SILENCE LOOKING AWAY FROM ALICE AS HE SPOKE TO BE CALLED AN EGG VERY
AND IT HAPPENED THAT IT CAME TO BE WASHED IN COMPANY WITH A GARTER NAY SAID THE COLLAR
IF HE SMILED MUCH MORE THE ENDS OF HIS MOUTH MIGHT MEET BEHIND SHE THOUGHT AND THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIS HEAD I'M AFRAID IT WOULD COME OFF
BUT HUMPTY DUMPTY ONLY SHUT HIS EYES AND SAID WAIT TILL YOU'VE TRIED ALICE WAITED A MINUTE TO SEE IF HE WOULD SPEAK AGAIN
HUMPTY DUMPTY EXCLAIMED TRIUMPHANTLY YOU NEVER SAID A WORD LIKE IT
BUT I AM EXTREMELY SORRY FOR THE GARTER I MEAN THE GIRDLE THAT WENT INTO THE WATER TUB I HAVE MUCH ON MY CONSCIENCE I WANT TO BECOME WHITE PAPER
DO YOU SEEK MY HAND SAID THE SCISSORS
WHEN SHE HAD COME WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF IT SHE SAW THAT IT HAD EYES AND A NOSE AND MOUTH AND WHEN SHE HAD COME CLOSE TO IT SHE SAW
IN I TOLD THEM ONCE I TOLD THEM TWICE THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ADVICE I TOOK A KETTLE LARGE AND NEW
HOW WELL YOU CAN STRETCH YOUR LEGS OUT IT IS THE MOST GRACEFUL PERFORMANCE I HAVE EVER SEEN
BUT GLORY DOESN'T MEAN A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT ALICE OBJECTED WHEN I USE A WORD HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID IN RATHER A SCORNFUL TONE
HOW OLD DID YOU SAY YOU WERE ALICE MADE A SHORT CALCULATION AND SAID SEVEN YEARS AND SIX MONTHS WRONG
YOU DESERVE TO BE A BARONESS SAID THE COLLAR ALL THAT I HAVE IS A FINE GENTLEMAN A BOOT JACK AND A HAIR COMB IF I ONLY HAD THE BARONY
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE SAID ALICE AND HOW MANY BIRTHDAYS HAVE YOU ONE
SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY ALICE DIDN'T WANT TO BEGIN ANOTHER ARGUMENT SO SHE SAID NOTHING SEVEN YEARS AND SIX MONTHS HUMPTY DUMPTY REPEATED THOUGHTFULLY
CRIED HUMPTY DUMPTY
AS HIS EYES WERE STEADILY FIXED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND HE DIDN'T TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE OF HER SHE THOUGHT HE MUST BE A STUFFED FIGURE AFTER ALL
ALICE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO SAY ANYTHING SO AFTER A MINUTE HUMPTY DUMPTY BEGAN AGAIN THEY'VE A TEMPER SOME OF THEM
HIM AND THEN HE WAS CONDEMNED I SHALL NOW BE OBLIGED TO ASK THE HAIR COMB IT IS SURPRISING HOW WELL YOU PRESERVE YOUR TEETH MISS SAID THE COLLAR
AT THE EDGE AND SO CAME THE LONG SCISSORS TO CUT OFF THE JAGGED PART OH SAID THE COLLAR YOU ARE CERTAINLY THE FIRST OPERA DANCER
CERTAINLY SAID ALICE
I'M AFRAID I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID ALICE IT GETS EASIER FURTHER ON HUMPTY DUMPTY REPLIED I SENT TO THEM AGAIN TO SAY
AND THE MOME RATHS
IMPENETRABILITY THAT'S WHAT I SAY
HUMPTY DUMPTY TOOK THE BOOK AND LOOKED AT IT CAREFULLY THAT SEEMS TO BE DONE RIGHT HE BEGAN YOU'RE HOLDING IT UPSIDE DOWN ALICE INTERRUPTED
NEVER HAPPENED TO IT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO BEWARE
HAVE YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF BEING BETROTHED YES OF COURSE YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT SAID THE HAIR COMB
HE SAID AT LAST WHEN A PERSON DOESN'T KNOW A CRAVAT FROM A BELT I KNOW IT'S VERY IGNORANT OF ME ALICE SAID
ALICE ASKED DOUBTFULLY OF COURSE IT MUST HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID WITH A SHORT LAUGH MY NAME MEANS THE SHAPE I AM
AND THEY PUT ME OUT I SENT A MESSAGE TO THE FISH I TOLD THEM
AND A BEAUTIFUL ONE AS YOU SAY IT'S A PRESENT FROM THE WHITE KING AND QUEEN THERE NOW IS IT REALLY SAID ALICE QUITE PLEASED TO FIND THAT SHE HAD
ARE SOMETHING LIKE BADGERS
I AM QUITE CHANGED I BEGIN TO UNFOLD MYSELF YOU WILL BURN A HOLE IN ME OH I OFFER YOU MY HAND RAG SAID THE BOX IRON
ANXIETY FOR THE QUEER CREATURE THAT WALL IS SO VERY NARROW WHAT TREMENDOUSLY EASY RIDDLES YOU ASK HUMPTY DUMPTY GROWLED OUT
TO BE SURE I WAS HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID GAILY AS SHE TURNED IT ROUND FOR HIM I THOUGHT IT LOOKED A LITTLE QUEER AS I WAS SAYING THAT SEEMS TO BE DONE RIGHT
MAYHAP YOU'LL NEVER SEE SUCH ANOTHER
I'M NOT CERTAIN ABOUT I THINK IT'S SHORT FOR FROM HOME MEANING THAT THEY'D LOST THEIR WAY YOU KNOW AND WHAT DOES OUTGRABE MEAN WELL
MOUTH UNDER IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME NOW IF YOU HAD THE TWO EYES ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE NOSE FOR INSTANCE OR THE MOUTH AT THE TOP THAT
IS THE GRASS PLOT ROUND A SUN DIAL I SUPPOSE SAID ALICE SURPRISED AT HER OWN INGENUITY
BUT THE COLLAR THE MOST FOR HE WAS A REAL BOASTER I HAVE HAD SUCH AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF SWEETHEARTS SAID THE COLLAR I COULD NOT BE IN PEACE IT IS TRUE
THOUGH I HAVEN'T TIME TO LOOK IT OVER THOROUGHLY JUST NOW
ALICE COULDN'T HELP SMILING AS SHE TOOK OUT HER MEMORANDUM BOOK AND WORKED THE SUM FOR HIM
SHE FELT THAT IT WOULD HARDLY BE CIVIL TO STAY SO SHE GOT UP AND HELD OUT HER HAND GOOD BYE
AND KICKED AND KNOCKED AND WHEN I FOUND THE DOOR WAS SHUT I TRIED TO TURN THE HANDLE BUT THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE IS THAT ALL ALICE TIMIDLY ASKED
I LIKE BIRTHDAY PRESENTS BEST SHE SAID AT LAST
NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THE QUESTION IS SAID ALICE WHETHER YOU CAN MAKE WORDS MEAN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
SHE ADDED HOPING TO TURN HER REMARK INTO A SORT OF A COMPLIMENT SOME PEOPLE SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKING AWAY FROM HER AS USUAL HAVE NO MORE SENSE THAN A BABY
I WAS ALWAYS A FINE STARCHED UP GENTLEMAN I HAD BOTH A BOOT JACK AND A HAIR COMB
IN SUMMER WHEN THE DAYS ARE LONG PERHAPS YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THE SONG IN AUTUMN WHEN THE LEAVES ARE BROWN TAKE PEN AND INK
FIT FOR THE DEED I HAD TO DO MY HEART WENT HOP MY HEART WENT THUMP I FILLED THE KETTLE AT THE PUMP THEN SOME ONE CAME TO ME AND SAID
AND THEY'RE SOMETHING LIKE CORKSCREWS
AS IF HIS NAME WERE WRITTEN ALL OVER HIS FACE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN A HUNDRED TIMES EASILY ON THAT ENORMOUS FACE HUMPTY DUMPTY WAS SITTING WITH
THAT'S A GREAT DEAL TO MAKE ONE WORD MEAN ALICE SAID IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE WHEN I MAKE A WORD DO A LOT OF WORK LIKE THAT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY
IF IT COMES TO THAT OH IT NEEDN'T COME TO THAT ALICE HASTILY SAID HOPING TO KEEP HIM FROM BEGINNING THE PIECE I'M GOING TO REPEAT
I BEG YOUR PARDON ALICE SAID WITH A PUZZLED AIR I'M NOT OFFENDED SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY I MEAN WHAT IS AN UN BIRTHDAY PRESENT
SHE SAID THAT ONE CAN'T HELP GROWING OLDER ONE CAN'T PERHAPS SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY BUT TWO CAN
WHOLE LIFE'S HISTORY PRINTED ON IT EVEN THE MOST SECRET
AND IT BECAME SO
WITH PROPER ASSISTANCE YOU MIGHT HAVE LEFT OFF AT SEVEN
SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY STRETCHING OUT ONE OF HIS GREAT HANDS
THE LITTLE FISHES OF THE SEA THEY SENT AN ANSWER BACK TO ME
THERE WAS A LARGE COMPANY OF RAGS THE FINE BY THEMSELVES AND THE COARSE BY THEMSELVES JUST AS IT SHOULD BE THEY ALL HAD MUCH TO SAY
SHE SAID AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD I SHOULDN'T KNOW YOU AGAIN IF WE DID MEET HUMPTY DUMPTY REPLIED IN A DISCONTENTED TONE GIVING HER ONE OF HIS FINGERS TO SHAKE
IS A THIN SHABBY LOOKING BIRD
SAID ALICE NOT WISHING TO BEGIN AN ARGUMENT WHY
HOW OLD ARE YOU ALICE EXPLAINED IF I'D MEANT THAT
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR DAYS WHEN YOU MIGHT GET
HUMPTY DUMPTY SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY OF COURSE YOU DON'T TILL I TELL YOU I MEANT THERE'S A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT FOR YOU
WHO BECAME GLOWING HOT BUT I LEFT HER STANDING TILL SHE GOT BLACK AGAIN THERE WAS ALSO THE FIRST OPERA DANCER SHE GAVE ME THAT CUT
THERE ARE TWO MEANINGS PACKED UP INTO ONE WORD I SEE IT NOW ALICE REMARKED THOUGHTFULLY AND WHAT ARE TOVES
THEY HAD HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF THE SUBJECT OF AGE SHE THOUGHT AND IF THEY REALLY WERE TO TAKE TURNS IN CHOOSING SUBJECTS IT WAS HER TURN NOW AT LEAST
WAS NOT TRUE FOR IT WAS HIS MASTER WHO HAD THEM BUT HE BOASTED DON'T COME SO NEAR ME SAID THE GARTER
AND WENT PROUDLY OVER THE COLLAR FOR SHE FANCIED SHE WAS A STEAM ENGINE THAT WOULD GO ON THE RAILROAD AND DRAW THE WAGGONS RAG
AND SO FINE SO SOFT AND SO NEAT
THE LITTLE FISHES ARE IN BED I SAID TO HIM I SAID IT PLAIN THEN YOU MUST WAKE THEM UP AGAIN I SAID IT VERY LOUD AND CLEAR
THE FISHES ANSWERED
OF COURSE I DON'T THINK SO WHY IF
THEY ARE THAT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY ALSO THEY MAKE THEIR NESTS UNDER SUN DIALS ALSO THEY LIVE ON CHEESE
AND HOW EXACTLY LIKE AN EGG HE IS SHE SAID ALOUD STANDING WITH HER HANDS READY TO CATCH HIM FOR SHE WAS EVERY MOMENT EXPECTING HIM TO FALL
SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY AND IT'S MY TURN TO CHOOSE A SUBJECT HE TALKS ABOUT IT JUST AS IF IT WAS A GAME THOUGHT ALICE SO HERE'S A QUESTION FOR YOU
THERE'S GLORY FOR YOU
AND AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE FELL OFF THE WALL IN DOING SO AND OFFERED ALICE HIS HAND SHE WATCHED HIM A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY AS SHE TOOK IT
HUMPTY DUMPTY CRIED BREAKING INTO A SUDDEN PASSION YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING AT DOORS AND BEHIND TREES AND DOWN CHIMNEYS OR YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT
WHICH WAS NECK AND WHICH WAS WAIST EVIDENTLY HUMPTY DUMPTY WAS VERY ANGRY
BUT THE GARTER WAS SO BASHFUL SO MODEST AND THOUGHT IT WAS A STRANGE QUESTION TO ANSWER YOU ARE CERTAINLY A GIRDLE SAID THE COLLAR THAT IS TO SAY AN INSIDE GIRDLE
AND A GOOD HANDSOME SHAPE IT IS TOO WITH A NAME LIKE YOURS YOU MIGHT BE ANY SHAPE ALMOST
SHE NEVER FINISHED THE SENTENCE FOR AT THIS MOMENT
SAID ALICE WHAT THAT MEANS NOW YOU TALK LIKE A REASONABLE CHILD SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKING VERY MUCH PLEASED I MEANT BY IMPENETRABILITY
SO SHE SAT DOWN AND SAID
EXCLAIMED THE COLLAR NOW THERE WAS NO OTHER TO COURT AND SO HE DESPISED IT A LONG TIME PASSED AWAY THEN THE COLLAR CAME INTO THE RAG CHEST AT THE PAPER MILL
HIS LEGS CROSSED LIKE A TURK ON THE TOP OF A HIGH WALL SUCH A NARROW ONE THAT ALICE QUITE WONDERED HOW HE COULD KEEP HIS BALANCE AND
SHE WAS SO FEROCIOUS MY OWN HAIR COMB WAS IN LOVE WITH ME SHE LOST ALL HER TEETH
PARTICULARLY VERBS THEY'RE THE PROUDEST ADJECTIVES YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH BUT NOT VERBS HOWEVER I CAN MANAGE THE WHOLE LOT OF THEM
I WENT AND SHOUTED IN HIS EAR HUMPTY DUMPTY RAISED HIS VOICE ALMOST TO A SCREAM
BUT TELL ME YOUR NAME AND YOUR BUSINESS MY NAME IS ALICE BUT IT'S A STUPID ENOUGH NAME HUMPTY DUMPTY INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY
BUT THE COLLAR CAME TO BE JUST THIS VERY PIECE OF WHITE PAPER WE HERE SEE AND ON WHICH THE STORY IS PRINTED AND THAT WAS BECAUSE IT BOASTED SO TERRIBLY AFTERWARDS OF WHAT HAD
I THINK IT WAS
I'M NOT PROUD YOU MAY SHAKE HANDS WITH ME
HUMPTY DUMPTY REMARKED SEVERELY ALICE WAS SILENT IN SPRING WHEN WOODS ARE GETTING GREEN
I HAVEN'T INDEED ALICE SAID VERY GENTLY IT'S IN A BOOK AH WELL THEY MAY WRITE SUCH THINGS IN A BOOK HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID IN A CALMER TONE
IN WINTER WHEN THE FIELDS ARE WHITE I SING THIS SONG FOR YOUR DELIGHT ONLY I DON'T SING IT HE ADDED AS AN EXPLANATION
SHE WAS A GIRDLE SO FINE SO SOFT AND SO CHARMING SHE THREW HERSELF INTO A TUB OF WATER FOR MY SAKE
THERE'S ANOTHER PORTMANTEAU FOR YOU
I SAID YOU LOOKED LIKE AN EGG SIR ALICE GENTLY EXPLAINED
AND WRITE IT DOWN I WILL IF I CAN REMEMBER IT SO LONG
SHE SAID GOOD BYE ONCE MORE AND GETTING NO ANSWER TO THIS SHE QUIETLY WALKED AWAY BUT SHE COULDN'T HELP SAYING TO HERSELF AS SHE WENT
THAT WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT SUBJECT AND IT WOULD BE JUST AS WELL IF YOU'D MENTION WHAT YOU MEAN TO DO NEXT AS I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T MEAN TO STOP HERE ALL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR OF COURSE HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKED DOUBTFUL I'D RATHER SEE THAT DONE ON PAPER HE SAID
ALMOST OUT LOUD FORGETTING THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY WOULD HEAR HER DON'T STAND THERE CHATTERING TO YOURSELF LIKE THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID LOOKING AT HER FOR THE FIRST TIME
ALL THAT HARD STUFF TO YOU I READ IT IN A BOOK SAID ALICE BUT I HAD SOME POETRY REPEATED TO ME MUCH EASIER THAN THAT
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A HISTORY OF ENGLAND THAT IS NOW TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ME I'M ONE THAT HAS SPOKEN TO A KING I AM
FOR WE CAN NEVER KNOW IF WE MAY NOT IN THE COURSE OF TIME ALSO COME INTO THE RAG CHEST AND BE MADE INTO WHITE PAPER AND THEN HAVE OUR
IT MEANS JUST WHAT
AN UNCOMFORTABLE SORT OF AGE NOW IF YOU'D ASKED MY ADVICE I'D HAVE SAID LEAVE OFF AT SEVEN BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW
SHE CORRECTED HERSELF ON SECOND THOUGHTS A BEAUTIFUL CRAVAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID
A BELT I MEAN I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE ADDED IN DISMAY
ASK ANOTHER DON'T YOU THINK YOU'D BE SAFER DOWN ON THE GROUND
OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY SHE REPEATED THIS ALOUD AS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HAVE SUCH A LONG WORD TO SAY OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY PEOPLE
I SEE YOU DON'T SAID ALICE
WHEN HE DID SPEAK AGAIN IT WAS IN A DEEP GROWL
AND A GOOD MANY THAT HAVEN'T BEEN INVENTED JUST YET THIS SOUNDED VERY HOPEFUL SO ALICE REPEATED THE FIRST VERSE TWAS BRILLIG
AND ALICE THOUGHT WITH A SHUDDER I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE MESSENGER FOR ANYTHING BUT HE WAS VERY STIFF AND PROUD HE SAID YOU NEEDN'T SHOUT SO LOUD
HUMPTY DUMPTY HOWEVER THE EGG ONLY GOT LARGER AND LARGER
THAT'S ALL SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY GOOD BYE THIS WAS RATHER SUDDEN ALICE THOUGHT BUT AFTER SUCH A VERY STRONG HINT THAT SHE OUGHT TO BE GOING
JABBERWOCKY LET'S HEAR IT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY I CAN EXPLAIN ALL THE POEMS THAT WERE EVER INVENTED
PRUDE EXCLAIMED THE COLLAR AND THEN IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE WASHING TUB IT WAS STARCHED HUNG OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR IN THE SUNSHINE AND WAS THEN LAID ON THE IRONING BLANKET
AND A LONG WAY BEYOND IT ON EACH SIDE ALICE ADDED EXACTLY SO
EVIDENTLY ADDRESSED TO A TREE SO SHE STOOD AND SOFTLY REPEATED TO HERSELF HUMPTY DUMPTY SAT ON A WALL HUMPTY DUMPTY HAD A GREAT FALL ALL THE KING'S
HORSES AND ALL THE KING'S MEN COULDN'T PUT HUMPTY DUMPTY IN HIS PLACE AGAIN THAT LAST LINE IS MUCH TOO LONG FOR THE POETRY SHE ADDED
OH SAID ALICE SHE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO MAKE ANY OTHER REMARK AH YOU SHOULD SEE EM
BUT HE HAD THE FINEST FALSE COLLARS IN THE WORLD AND IT IS ABOUT ONE OF THESE COLLARS THAT WE ARE NOW TO HEAR A STORY IT WAS SO OLD THAT IT BEGAN TO THINK OF MARRIAGE
ALICE SAID INDIGNANTLY TOO PROUD THE OTHER INQUIRED
IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE GINGER CAME BACK AND BEFORE WE WERE LEFT ALONE AND THEN SHE TOLD ME ALL THAT SHE HAD SEEN I CAN'T TELL MUCH SHE SAID WE WENT A GALLOP NEARLY ALL THE WAY
WELL OLD CHAP HE SAID I THINK WE SHOULD SUIT EACH OTHER I'LL GIVE TWENTY FOUR FOR HIM SAY TWENTY FIVE AND YOU SHALL HAVE HIM TWENTY FOUR TEN SAID MY FRIEND IN A VERY DECIDED TONE
I HARDLY KNOW WHERE I AM GOING OR WHAT I HAD BETTER DO SAID THE SOLDIER BUT I THINK I SHOULD LIKE VERY WELL TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS THAT THE PRINCESSES DANCE AND THEN IN TIME I MIGHT BE A KING WELL SAID THE OLD DAME
AND THERE WERE SOME VERY DEJECTED LOOKING OLD HORSES WITH THE UNDER LIP HANGING DOWN AND THE EARS LYING BACK HEAVILY AS IF THERE WERE NO MORE PLEASURE IN LIFE AND NO MORE HOPE THERE WERE SOME SO THIN YOU MIGHT SEE ALL THEIR RIBS
THERE WAS ONE MAN I THOUGHT IF HE WOULD BUY ME I SHOULD BE HAPPY HE WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN NOR YET ONE OF THE LOUD FLASHY SORT THAT CALL THEMSELVES SO HE WAS RATHER A SMALL MAN BUT WELL MADE
AND WHEN THE KING ASKED HIM WHERE DO MY TWELVE DAUGHTERS DANCE AT NIGHT HE ANSWERED WITH TWELVE PRINCES IN A CASTLE UNDER GROUND AND THEN HE TOLD THE KING ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHOWED HIM THE THREE BRANCHES AND THE GOLDEN CUP
THAT IF ANY PERSON COULD DISCOVER THE SECRET AND FIND OUT WHERE IT WAS THAT THE PRINCESSES DANCED IN THE NIGHT HE SHOULD HAVE THE ONE HE LIKED BEST FOR HIS WIFE AND SHOULD BE KING AFTER HIS DEATH
AS SOON AS THE TIME CAME WHEN HE WAS TO DECLARE THE SECRET HE WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE KING WITH THE THREE BRANCHES AND THE GOLDEN CUP AND THE TWELVE PRINCESSES STOOD LISTENING BEHIND THE DOOR TO HEAR WHAT HE WOULD SAY
AS IF HE WAS FAST ASLEEP WHEN THE TWELVE PRINCESSES HEARD THIS THEY LAUGHED HEARTILY AND THE ELDEST SAID THIS FELLOW TOO MIGHT HAVE DONE A WISER THING THAN LOSE HIS LIFE IN THIS WAY
THEY CONFESSED IT ALL AND THE KING ASKED THE SOLDIER
AND GLITTERED AND SPARKLED BEAUTIFULLY THE SOLDIER WISHED TO TAKE AWAY SOME TOKEN OF THE PLACE SO HE BROKE OFF A LITTLE BRANCH AND THERE CAME A LOUD NOISE FROM THE TREE THEN THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SAID AGAIN
BUT THE YOUNGEST SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS WHILE YOU ARE SO HAPPY I FEEL VERY UNEASY I AM SURE SOME MISCHANCE WILL BEFALL US YOU SIMPLETON SAID THE ELDEST YOU ARE ALWAYS AFRAID
ONLY TAKE CARE NOT TO DRINK ANY OF THE WINE WHICH ONE OF THE PRINCESSES WILL BRING TO YOU IN THE EVENING AND AS SOON AS SHE LEAVES YOU PRETEND TO BE FAST ASLEEP THEN SHE GAVE HIM A CLOAK AND SAID
TILL WE CAME TO HIS GATE THERE WAS A SHORT DRIVE UP TO THE HOUSE BETWEEN TALL EVERGREENS BLANTYRE ALIGHTED AT THE GATE AND WAS GOING TO OPEN IT FOR LADY ANNE BUT SHE SAID I WILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE
THE SOLDIER PLACED HIMSELF IN THE BOAT WITH THE ELDEST PRINCESS AND ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE THEY TOOK LEAVE OF EACH OTHER THE PRINCESSES PROMISING TO COME AGAIN THE NEXT NIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER BROKE A BRANCH FROM EACH AND EVERY TIME THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE WHICH MADE THE YOUNGEST SISTER TREMBLE WITH FEAR BUT THE ELDEST STILL SAID IT WAS ONLY THE PRINCES WHO WERE CRYING FOR JOY
SO THAT WHEN SHE PUT THE CUP TO HER MOUTH IT WAS EMPTY AT THIS TOO THE YOUNGEST SISTER WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED BUT THE ELDEST ALWAYS SILENCED HER
STEADY WOAH STEADY ON THE HIGHROAD WE WERE ALL RIGHT AND AT THE DOCTOR'S AND THE HALL HE DID HIS ERRAND LIKE A GOOD MAN AND TRUE THEY ASKED HIM IN TO TAKE A DROP OF SOMETHING
HE THEN SOMEHOW SCRAMBLED INTO THE SADDLE AND WITH A GEE UP AND A CLAP ON MY SIDES WITH BOTH HIS LEGS HE STARTED ON HIS JOURNEY MAKING A LITTLE CIRCUIT TO AVOID THE DIKE HE HAD NO WHIP WHICH SEEMED TO TROUBLE HIM
THEN THEY ROSE UP AND OPENED THEIR DRAWERS AND BOXES AND TOOK OUT ALL THEIR FINE CLOTHES AND DRESSED THEMSELVES AT THE GLASS
ORDERED HIS HEAD TO BE CUT OFF AFTER HIM CAME SEVERAL OTHERS
TO THE COMMON TO THE COMMON SIR SHE HAS TURNED OFF THERE I KNEW THIS COMMON VERY WELL IT WAS FOR THE MOST PART VERY UNEVEN GROUND COVERED WITH HEATHER AND DARK GREEN FURZE BUSHES
AND WITH ONE DETERMINED LEAP CLEARED BOTH DIKE AND BANK MOTIONLESS AMONG THE HEATHER WITH HER FACE TO THE EARTH
BUT HE WALKED OFF ONE OR TWO MORE CAME WHO DID NOT MEAN BUSINESS THEN THE HARD FACED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN AND OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS A VERY CLOSE BARGAIN WAS BEING DRIVEN FOR MY SALESMAN
AND A GOOD MANY LIKE MYSELF HANDSOME AND HIGH BRED
I WAS PUT WITH TWO OR THREE OTHER STRONG USEFUL LOOKING HORSES AND A GOOD MANY PEOPLE CAME TO LOOK AT US THE GENTLEMEN ALWAYS TURNED FROM ME WHEN THEY SAW MY BROKEN KNEES
YOU SILLY CREATURE SAID THE ELDEST IT IS NOTHING BUT A NAIL IN THE WALL THEN DOWN THEY ALL WENT AND AT THE BOTTOM THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A MOST DELIGHTFUL GROVE OF TREES AND THE LEAVES WERE ALL OF SILVER
AS THEY WERE TROTTED OUT WITH A LEADING REIN THE GROOM RUNNING BY THE SIDE BUT ROUND IN THE BACKGROUND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF POOR THINGS SADLY BROKEN DOWN WITH HARD WORK WITH THEIR KNEES KNUCKLING OVER
AS SOON AS YOU PUT THAT ON YOU WILL BECOME INVISIBLE AND YOU WILL THEN BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE PRINCESSES WHEREVER THEY GO
BUT SHE GAVE A VIOLENT KICK AND DASHED OFF INTO A HEADLONG GALLOP IT WAS SO SUDDEN THAT LADY ANNE WAS NEARLY UNSEATED BUT SHE SOON RECOVERED HERSELF I GAVE A LOUD SHRILL NEIGH FOR HELP
JUST THEN SOME CART HORSES AND SEVERAL YOUNG COLTS CAME TROTTING OUT IN A VERY DISORDERLY MANNER WHILE A BOY BEHIND WAS CRACKING A GREAT WHIP THE COLTS WERE WILD AND FROLICSOME
TALKING TO HIMSELF AND TALKING TO ME HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO LONDON THROUGH PLEASANT LANES AND COUNTRY ROADS UNTIL WE CAME INTO THE GREAT LONDON THOROUGHFARE ON WHICH WE TRAVELED STEADILY
AND I HAVE FOLLOWED THE HOUNDS A GREAT MANY TIMES THOUGH I KNOW YOU DO NOT APPROVE OF LADIES HUNTING BUT STILL THAT IS THE FACT AND I INTEND TO TRY THIS LIZZIE
AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE COACH HOUSES AND STABLES ON THE OTHER MY OWNER PULLED UP AT ONE OF THE HOUSES AND WHISTLED THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A YOUNG WOMAN FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE GIRL AND BOY RAN OUT
AT ONCE THE LITTLE HAND WAS PATTING ABOUT ALL OVER MY SHOULDER WITHOUT FEAR HOW GOOD IT FELT LET ME GET HIM A BRAN MASH WHILE YOU RUB HIM DOWN SAID THE MOTHER DO POLLY IT'S JUST WHAT HE WANTS
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN HOW MANY KINGS SONS HAVE ALREADY WATCHED IN VAIN AND AS FOR THIS SOLDIER EVEN IF I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM HIS SLEEPING DRAUGHT
SO THEY WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO A GREAT LAKE AND AT THE SIDE OF THE LAKE THERE LAY TWELVE LITTLE BOATS WITH TWELVE HANDSOME PRINCES IN THEM WHO SEEMED TO BE WAITING THERE FOR THE PRINCESSES ONE OF THE PRINCESSES WENT INTO EACH BOAT
THROUGH SOME ACCIDENT OR BLEMISH UNSOUNDNESS OF WIND OR SOME OTHER COMPLAINT THERE WERE SOME SPLENDID ANIMALS QUITE IN THEIR PRIME AND FIT FOR ANYTHING THEY WERE THROWING OUT THEIR LEGS AND SHOWING OFF THEIR PACES IN HIGH STYLE
THEN HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN ON HIS BED AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
BUT THE ELDEST SAID IT IS ONLY OUR PRINCES WHO ARE SHOUTING FOR JOY AT OUR APPROACH THEN THEY CAME TO ANOTHER GROVE OF TREES WHERE ALL THE LEAVES WERE OF GOLD AND AFTERWARDS TO A THIRD WHERE THE LEAVES WERE ALL GLITTERING DIAMONDS
BEGAN TO THINK HE SHOULD NOT GET ALL HE ASKED AND MUST COME DOWN BUT JUST THEN THE GRAY EYED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN I COULD NOT HELP REACHING OUT MY HEAD TOWARD HIM HE STROKED MY FACE KINDLY
AND WHETHER IT WAS THE STUPID COLT OR THE LOUD CRACKING OF THE WHIP
AND QUICK IN ALL HIS MOTIONS I KNEW IN A MOMENT BY THE WAY HE HANDLED ME THAT HE WAS USED TO HORSES HE SPOKE GENTLY AND HIS GRAY EYE HAD A KINDLY CHEERY LOOK IN IT IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO SAY
JUST AS WE WERE MOVING OFF A FOOTMAN CAME OUT WITH A SLIP OF PAPER
I AM NOT VERY YOUNG SO I WILL HAVE THE ELDEST AND THEY WERE MARRIED THAT VERY DAY
AND WHEN THE EVENING CAME HE WAS LED TO THE OUTER CHAMBER JUST AS HE WAS GOING TO LIE DOWN THE ELDEST OF THE PRINCESSES BROUGHT HIM A CUP OF WINE BUT THE SOLDIER THREW IT ALL AWAY SECRETLY TAKING CARE NOT TO DRINK A DROP
TWO DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT BLANTYRE PAID ME A VISIT HE PATTED ME AND PRAISED ME VERY MUCH HE TOLD LORD GEORGE THAT HE WAS SURE THE HORSE KNEW OF ANNIE'S DANGER AS WELL AS HE DID
WHILE OTHERS WOULD TAKE THEIR HANDS GENTLY OVER ONE'S BODY WITH A PAT NOW AND THEN AS MUCH AS TO SAY BY YOUR LEAVE OF COURSE I JUDGED A GOOD DEAL OF THE BUYERS BY THEIR MANNERS TO MYSELF
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE STAIRS THE SOLDIER RAN ON BEFORE THE PRINCESSES AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND AS THE TWELVE SISTERS SLOWLY CAME UP VERY MUCH TIRED THEY HEARD HIM SNORING IN HIS BED SO THEY SAID
BUT WHOEVER TRIED AND DID NOT SUCCEED AFTER THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH A KING'S SON SOON CAME HE WAS WELL ENTERTAINED AND IN THE EVENING
LOOSENED HER COLLAR FELT HER HANDS AND WRIST THEN STARTED UP AND LOOKED WILDLY ROUND HIM FOR HELP AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE WERE TWO MEN CUTTING TURF WHO SEEING LIZZIE RUNNING WILD WITHOUT A RIDER
NOW ALL IS QUITE SAFE THEN THEY UNDRESSED THEMSELVES PUT AWAY THEIR FINE CLOTHES PULLED OFF THEIR SHOES AND WENT TO BED IN THE MORNING THE SOLDIER SAID NOTHING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
I FOUND BY THEIR CONVERSATION THAT MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS NOW OUT OF DANGER AND WOULD SOON BE ABLE TO RIDE AGAIN
WAS TAKEN TO THE CHAMBER NEXT TO THE ONE WHERE THE PRINCESSES LAY IN THEIR TWELVE BEDS THERE HE WAS TO SIT AND WATCH WHERE THEY WENT TO DANCE AND IN ORDER THAT NOTHING MIGHT PASS WITHOUT HIS HEARING IT THE DOOR OF HIS CHAMBER WAS LEFT OPEN
TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AFTER AWHILE SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE CARRIAGE AND WE CAME HOME TOGETHER I HEARD MY MASTER SAY TO A GENTLEMAN WHO STOPPED HIM TO INQUIRE THAT HE HOPED NO BONES WERE BROKEN BUT THAT SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN YET
THERE WERE ALSO OPEN SPACES OF FINE SHORT GRASS WITH ANT HILLS AND MOLE TURNS EVERYWHERE
AND GOT THERE JUST AS THE DOCTOR RODE UP THERE WAS A WOMAN SITTING ON THE GROUND WITH THE LADY'S HEAD IN HER LAP THE DOCTOR POURED SOMETHING INTO HER MOUTH BUT ALL THAT I HEARD WAS SHE IS NOT DEAD THEN I WAS LED OFF BY A MAN
THERE HAD BEEN A WIDE DIKE RECENTLY CUT AND THE EARTH FROM THE CUTTING WAS CAST UP ROUGHLY ON THE OTHER SIDE SURELY THIS WOULD STOP THEM BUT NO WITH SCARCELY A PAUSE LIZZIE TOOK THE LEAP
AND SHE CRIED OUT TO HER SISTERS ALL IS NOT RIGHT
SHE WAS UNCOMMON GOOD TO MY WIFE IN THE WINTER THEN MOUNT THIS HORSE MY FRIEND YOUR NECK WILL BE QUITE SAFE AND RIDE TO THE DOCTOR'S AND ASK HIM TO COME INSTANTLY
THE LADY ANNE OR A RUNAWAY HORSE EARLY IN THE SPRING LORD W AND PART OF HIS FAMILY WENT UP TO LONDON AND TOOK YORK WITH THEM
AND EVERY THING HAPPENED JUST AS BEFORE THE PRINCESSES DANCED EACH TIME TILL THEIR SHOES WERE WORN TO PIECES AND THEN RETURNED HOME HOWEVER ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE SOLDIER CARRIED AWAY ONE OF THE GOLDEN CUPS AS A TOKEN OF WHERE HE HAD BEEN
AND THE SOLDIER STEPPED INTO THE SAME BOAT WITH THE YOUNGEST AS THEY WERE ROWING OVER THE LAKE THE PRINCE WHO WAS IN THE BOAT WITH THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS AND THE SOLDIER SAID I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT IS BUT THOUGH I AM ROWING WITH ALL MY MIGHT
MAY OPEN HER EYES SOON THEN SEEING THE OTHER MAN HE CALLED OUT HERE JOE RUN FOR SOME WATER AND TELL MY MISSIS
AT LAST IN PASSING THROUGH ONE WE CAME TO A LONG CAB STAND WHEN MY RIDER CALLED OUT IN A CHEERY VOICE GOOD NIGHT GOVERNOR HALLOO CRIED A VOICE HAVE YOU GOT A GOOD ONE I THINK SO REPLIED MY OWNER
THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES THERE WAS A KING WHO HAD TWELVE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS THEY SLEPT IN TWELVE BEDS ALL IN ONE ROOM AND WHEN THEY WENT TO BED THE DOORS WERE SHUT
AGAIN AND AGAIN I NEIGHED PAWING THE GROUND IMPATIENTLY AND TOSSING MY HEAD TO GET THE REIN LOOSE I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BLANTYRE CAME RUNNING TO THE GATE HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY ABOUT
NO DOUBT A HORSE FAIR IS A VERY AMUSING PLACE TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AT ANY RATE THERE IS PLENTY TO SEE
THE MONEY WAS PAID ON THE SPOT AND MY NEW MASTER TOOK MY HALTER AND LED ME OUT OF THE FAIR TO AN INN WHERE HE HAD A SADDLE AND BRIDLE READY HE GAVE ME A GOOD FEED OF OATS AND STOOD BY WHILE I ATE IT
STAYING AT THE HALL HE ALWAYS RODE LIZZIE AND PRAISED HER SO MUCH THAT ONE DAY LADY ANNE ORDERED THE SIDE SADDLE TO BE PUT ON HER AND THE OTHER SADDLE ON ME WHEN WE CAME TO THE DOOR THE GENTLEMAN SEEMED VERY UNEASY
WHEN LORD GEORGE TOOK GINGER FOR HUNTING YORK SHOOK HIS HEAD HE SAID IT OUGHT TO BE A STEADY HAND TO TRAIN A HORSE FOR THE FIRST SEASON AND NOT A RANDOM RIDER LIKE LORD GEORGE GINGER USED TO LIKE IT VERY MUCH
OPEN THE GATES AND MOTHER WILL BRING US THE LANTERN THE NEXT MINUTE THEY WERE ALL STANDING ROUND ME IN A SMALL STABLE YARD IS HE GENTLE FATHER YES DOLLY AS GENTLE AS YOUR OWN KITTEN COME AND PAT HIM
AND NOT ANOTHER SIXPENCE YES OR NO DONE SAID THE SALESMAN AND YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THERE'S A MONSTROUS DEAL OF QUALITY IN THAT HORSE AND IF YOU WANT HIM FOR CAB WORK HE'S A BARGAIN
SOMETIMES WITH GINGER SOMETIMES WITH LIZZIE THIS LIZZIE WAS A BRIGHT BAY MARE ALMOST THOROUGHBRED AND A GREAT FAVORITE WITH THE GENTLEMEN ON ACCOUNT OF HER FINE ACTION AND LIVELY SPIRIT
NO NO HE SAID I'LL BE BACK TO EM AGAIN BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE FIELDS
WOULD THEY ASK THIS QUESTION FOR HER AT DOCTOR ASHLEY'S AND BRING THE ANSWER THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT A MILE OFF AND THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE WAS THE LAST IN IT WE WENT ALONG GAYLY ENOUGH
AND I WILL TRY YOUR CHARMING LIZZIE YOU MUST CONFESS THAT IN SIZE AND APPEARANCE
AND SOME WITH OLD SORES ON THEIR BACKS AND HIPS THESE WERE SAD SIGHTS FOR A HORSE TO LOOK UPON WHO KNOWS NOT BUT HE MAY COME TO THE SAME STATE THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF BARGAINING OF RUNNING UP AND BEATING DOWN
LONG BEFORE WE CAME TO THE BEND SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH WAY HAD SHE TURNED A WOMAN WAS STANDING AT HER GARDEN GATE SHADING HER EYES WITH HER HAND AND LOOKING EAGERLY UP THE ROAD
AND THE HEAD GROOM WAS LEFT IN CHARGE THE LADY HARRIET WHO REMAINED AT THE HALL WAS A GREAT INVALID AND NEVER WENT OUT IN THE CARRIAGE AND THE LADY ANNE PREFERRED RIDING ON HORSEBACK WITH HER BROTHER OR COUSINS
AND JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE FLYING FIGURE NOW FAR AWAY ON THE ROAD IN AN INSTANT HE SPRANG TO THE SADDLE I NEEDED NO WHIP NO SPUR FOR I WAS AS EAGER AS MY RIDER
NOW IT CHANCED THAT AN OLD SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN WOUNDED IN BATTLE AND COULD FIGHT NO LONGER PASSED THROUGH THE COUNTRY WHERE THIS KING REIGNED AND AS HE WAS TRAVELLING THROUGH A WOOD HE MET AN OLD WOMAN WHO ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING
AND IF A HORSE MAY SPEAK HIS MIND SO FAR AS HE UNDERSTANDS I SHOULD SAY THERE WERE MORE LIES TOLD AND MORE TRICKERY AT THAT HORSE FAIR
HOW IS THIS HE SAID ARE YOU TIRED OF YOUR GOOD BLACK AUSTER OH NO NOT AT ALL SHE REPLIED BUT I AM AMIABLE ENOUGH TO LET YOU RIDE HIM FOR ONCE
AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL MASH READY FOR ME SAUSAGE DUMPLING AND APPLE TURNOVER SHOUTED THE BOY WHICH SET THEM ALL LAUGHING I WAS LED INTO A COMFORTABLE CLEAN SMELLING STALL WITH PLENTY OF DRY STRAW
LONG STRINGS OF YOUNG HORSES OUT OF THE COUNTRY FRESH FROM THE MARSHES AND DROVES OF SHAGGY LITTLE WELSH PONIES NO HIGHER THAN MERRYLEGS AND HUNDREDS OF CART HORSES OF ALL SORTS
SO PLEASE HELP ME TO MOUNT LIKE A GOOD FRIEND AS YOU ARE THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE SAID HE PLACED HER CAREFULLY ON THE SADDLE LOOKED TO THE BIT AND CURB GAVE THE REINS GENTLY INTO HER HAND AND THEN MOUNTED ME
BUT MY PACE SOON CURED THAT DIFFICULTY AND HE FOUND THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO STICK TO THE SADDLE AND HOLD ME IN WHICH HE DID MANFULLY I SHOOK HIM AS LITTLE AS I COULD HELP BUT ONCE OR TWICE
TILL IN THE TWILIGHT WE REACHED THE GREAT CITY THE GAS LAMPS WERE ALREADY LIGHTED THERE WERE STREETS TO THE RIGHT AND STREETS TO THE LEFT AND STREETS CROSSING EACH OTHER FOR MILE UPON MILE I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NEVER COME TO THE END OF THEM
AND WAS SOON HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES LIZZIE WAS STANDING QUIETLY BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A FEW PACES OFF WITH HER BACK TO ME MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS SITTING EASILY WITH A LOOSE REIN
THERE THEY ALL LANDED AND WENT INTO THE CASTLE AND EACH PRINCE DANCED WITH HIS PRINCESS AND THE SOLDIER WHO WAS ALL THE TIME INVISIBLE DANCED WITH THEM TOO AND WHEN ANY OF THE PRINCESSES HAD A CUP OF WINE SET BY HER HE DRANK IT ALL UP
WE DO NOT GET ON SO FAST AS USUAL AND I AM QUITE TIRED THE BOAT SEEMS VERY HEAVY TODAY IT IS ONLY THE HEAT OF THE WEATHER SAID THE PRINCESS I FEEL IT VERY WARM TOO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE STOOD A FINE ILLUMINATED CASTLE
AND LOCKED UP BUT EVERY MORNING THEIR SHOES WERE FOUND TO BE QUITE WORN THROUGH AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DANCED IN ALL NIGHT AND YET NOBODY COULD FIND OUT HOW IT HAPPENED OR WHERE THEY HAD BEEN THEN THE KING MADE IT KNOWN TO ALL THE LAND
HIS SHOVEL DROPPED AND HIS HANDS RAISED AS WE CAME NEAR HE MADE A SIGN TO SPEAK
NO SMELL OF OLD BEER AND TOBACCO WHICH I HATED BUT A FRESH SMELL AS IF HE HAD COME OUT OF A HAYLOFT HE OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS FOR ME BUT THAT WAS REFUSED AND HE WALKED AWAY
THERE WAS NO SOUND GENTLY HE TURNED HER FACE UPWARD IT WAS GHASTLY WHITE AND THE EYES WERE CLOSED ANNIE DEAR ANNIE DO SPEAK BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER HE UNBUTTONED HER HABIT
ANOTHER BEND AND SHE WAS HIDDEN AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES WE CAUGHT GLIMPSES AND THEN LOST THEM WE SCARCELY SEEMED TO GAIN GROUND UPON THEM AT ALL AN OLD ROAD MENDER WAS STANDING NEAR A HEAP OF STONES
BUT GINGER WHO KNEW MORE OF HER THAN I DID TOLD ME SHE WAS RATHER NERVOUS
THE ELDEST LEADING THE WAY AND THINKING HE HAD NO TIME TO LOSE HE JUMPED UP PUT ON THE CLOAK WHICH THE OLD WOMAN HAD GIVEN HIM AND FOLLOWED THEM BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAIRS HE TROD ON THE GOWN OF THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN SHE CAME BACK I COULD SEE THAT SHE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH STRAINED AND NOW AND THEN SHE GAVE A SHORT COUGH SHE HAD TOO MUCH SPIRIT TO COMPLAIN BUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
SHE WAS A PERFECT HORSEWOMAN AND AS GAY AND GENTLE AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL SHE CHOSE ME FOR HER HORSE AND NAMED ME BLACK AUSTER I ENJOYED THESE RIDES VERY MUCH IN THE CLEAR COLD AIR
BUT THE KING'S SON SOON FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE IN THE MORNING HE FOUND THAT THE PRINCESSES HAD ALL BEEN DANCING FOR THE SOLES OF THEIR SHOES WERE FULL OF HOLES THE SAME THING HAPPENED THE SECOND AND THIRD NIGHT SO THE KING
THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE WERE TAKEN OFF AND A CLOTH THROWN OVER ME GINGER WAS SADDLED AND SENT OFF IN GREAT HASTE FOR LORD GEORGE AND I SOON HEARD THE CARRIAGE ROLL OUT OF THE YARD
WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THEN THE KING CALLED FOR THE PRINCESSES AND ASKED THEM WHETHER WHAT THE SOLDIER SAID WAS TRUE AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY WERE DISCOVERED
HE DETERMINED TO TRY HIS LUCK SO HE WENT TO THE KING AND SAID HE WAS WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THE TASK HE WAS AS WELL RECEIVED AS THE OTHERS HAD BEEN AND THE KING ORDERED FINE ROYAL ROBES TO BE GIVEN HIM
SCARCELY DRAWING THE REIN BLANTYRE SHOUTED WHICH WAY TO THE RIGHT CRIED THE WOMAN POINTING WITH HER HAND AND AWAY WE WENT UP THE RIGHT HAND ROAD THEN FOR A MOMENT WE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER
BUT NOW WITH A LIGHT HAND AND A PRACTICED EYE HE GUIDED ME OVER THE GROUND IN SUCH A MASTERLY MANNER THAT MY PACE WAS SCARCELY SLACKENED AND WE WERE DECIDEDLY GAINING ON THEM
THOUGH THE MAN WHO HAD ME SWORE IT WAS ONLY A SLIP IN THE STALL THE FIRST THING WAS TO PULL MY MOUTH OPEN
I WISH YOU LUCK WITH HIM THANK YOU GOVERNOR AND HE RODE ON WE SOON TURNED UP ONE OF THE SIDE STREETS AND ABOUT HALFWAY UP THAT WE TURNED INTO A VERY NARROW STREET WITH RATHER POOR LOOKING HOUSES ON ONE SIDE
HAD LEFT THEIR WORK TO CATCH HER BLANTYRE'S HALLOO SOON BROUGHT THEM TO THE SPOT THE FOREMOST MAN SEEMED MUCH TROUBLED AT THE SIGHT AND ASKED WHAT HE COULD DO CAN YOU RIDE
WE HAD HARDLY TURNED ON THE COMMON WHEN WE CAUGHT SIGHT AGAIN OF THE GREEN HABIT FLYING ON BEFORE US MY LADY'S HAT WAS GONE AND HER LONG BROWN HAIR WAS STREAMING BEHIND HER HER HEAD AND BODY WERE THROWN BACK
THEN FEEL ALL THE WAY DOWN MY LEGS AND GIVE ME A HARD FEEL OF THE SKIN AND FLESH AND THEN TRY MY PACES IT WAS WONDERFUL WHAT A DIFFERENCE THERE WAS IN THE WAY THESE THINGS WERE DONE SOME DID IT IN A ROUGH OFFHAND WAY AS IF
AND LEANING A LITTLE FORWARD WE DASHED AFTER THEM FOR ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF THE ROAD RAN STRAIGHT AND THEN BENT TO THE RIGHT AFTER WHICH IT DIVIDED INTO TWO ROADS
HUMMING A LITTLE SONG I LISTENED TO MY RIDER'S FOOTSTEPS UNTIL THEY REACHED THE HOUSE AND HEARD HIM KNOCK AT THE DOOR THERE WAS A MEADOW ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE GATE OF WHICH STOOD OPEN
LET ME BEG YOU TO HAVE THE SADDLES CHANGED MY DEAR COUSIN SAID LADY ANNE LAUGHING PRAY DO NOT TROUBLE YOUR GOOD CAREFUL HEAD ABOUT ME I HAVE BEEN A HORSEWOMAN EVER SINCE I WAS A BABY
WITH LADY ANNE'S MAID AND HELP I SHALL STAY HERE ALL RIGHT SIR
WHAT THEY DOES THEY DOES
THAT THERE IS A GOD AND THAT HE SET HER HER LIFE I DUNNOT BELIEVE SHE'LL EVER LIVE AGAIN
FOR HER HEART SMOTE HER AT THE IDEA OF LEAVING THE POOR AFFECTIONATE GIRL ALONE BUT MARY HAD FRIENDS AMONG THE NEIGHBOURS SHE SAID WHO WOULD COME IN AND SIT A BIT WITH HER IT WAS ALL RIGHT BUT FATHER HE WAS THERE BY THEM
AS SHE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN MORE HE HAD SHAKEN OFF HIS EMOTION AS IF HE WAS ASHAMED OF HAVING EVER GIVEN WAY TO IT
THERE WILL BE SOME RISK NO DOUBT BUT WE WILL LESSEN IT AS MUCH AS EVER WE CAN AND IT IS SO LITTLE
I'VE BEEN THINKING SHE MIGHT GO AND SEE HER MOTHER JUST AT THAT VERY TIME
MISTER HIGGINS I TRUST WHATEVER ELSE YOU HAVE GIVEN UP YOU BELIEVE' MISTER HALE'S VOICE DROPPED LOW IN REVERENCE
COME UP NOW MY HEART'S WELLY BROSSEN
HE SHOOK HIMSELF HEAVILY GAVE THEM ONE MORE SULLEN LOOK SPOKE NEVER A WORD BUT MADE FOR THE DOOR OH FATHER FATHER SAID MARY THROWING HERSELF UPON HIS ARM
IF IT WERE BUT FOR AN END WHICH AFFECTED THE GOOD OF ALL INSTEAD OF THAT OF MERELY ONE CLASS AS OPPOSED TO ANOTHER I RECKON IT'S TIME FOR ME TO BE GOING SIR SAID HIGGINS AS THE CLOCK STRUCK TEN HOME
MARY WAS HUMBLY SOBBING IN THE BACK GROUND THEY WENT DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT A WORD
WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE HOUSE SERVANT ALONG THE PASSAGE AND THROUGH THE KITCHEN STEPPING CAUTIOUSLY ON EVERY DARK MARK IN THE PATTERN OF THE OIL CLOTH IN ORDER TO CONCEAL HIS DIRTY FOOT PRINTS MARGARET RAN UPSTAIRS SHE MET DIXON ON THE LANDING HOW IS MAMMA WHERE IS PAPA
MISTER HIGGINS I'M SURE YOU'LL JOIN US IN FAMILY PRAYER HIGGINS LOOKED AT MARGARET DOUBTFULLY HER GRAVE SWEET EYES MET HIS THERE WAS NO COMPULSION ONLY DEEP INTEREST IN THEM HE DID NOT SPEAK BUT HE KEPT HIS PLACE
ON WHICH TO ARGUE FOR THE RIGHT AND THE JUST AND WHAT ARE THE UNION'S WAYS AND MEANS
HE STOOD UNCERTAIN WITH DOGGED IRRESOLUTION UPON HIS FACE
BUT UNWILLING TO USE THE VIOLENCE HE HAD THREATENED NOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE MARGARET LAID HER HAND ON HIS ARM COME WITH ME SHE SAID COME AND SEE HER
MARGARET TOUCHED HIS ARM VERY SOFTLY SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN BEFORE NOR HAD HE HEARD HER RISE
THEY CAME UP THICK AND CHOKED AND HOARSE WERE YO WITH HER
I SOME PLACES THEM'S FINED WHO SPEAKS TO HIM YO TRY THAT MISS TRY LIVING A YEAR OR TWO AMONG THEM AS LOOKS AWAY IF YO LOOK AT EM TRY WORKING WITHIN TWO YARDS O CROWDS O MEN WHO
THAT WERE ALL BUT THAT WERE ENOUGH FOR ME MISTER HALE BLEW HIS NOSE AND GOT UP TO SNUFF THE CANDLES IN ORDER TO CONCEAL HIS EMOTION
SHE TOLD ME LAST OF ALL TO KEEP YO FRO DRINK
THEY RECKONED ON THEIR FELLOW MEN AS IF THEY POSSESSED THE CALCULABLE POWERS OF MACHINES NO MORE NO LESS NO ALLOWANCE FOR HUMAN PASSIONS GETTING THE BETTER OF REASON AS IN THE CASE OF BOUCHER AND THE RIOTERS AND BELIEVING THAT THE REPRESENTATIONS OF THEIR INJURIES
ANY NIGHT BUT TO NIGHT OH HELP ME HE'S GOING OUT TO DRINK AGAIN FATHER I'LL NOT LEAVE YO
SAID MARGARET VERY SOFTLY HE UNDERSTOOD HER AND TOOK HER OFFERED HAND HOME MISS
AY SOOTH WE FEEL TOO STRONG IN WEAL TO NEED THEE ON THAT ROAD BUT WOE BEING COME THE SOUL IS DUMB THAT CRIETH NOT ON GOD MISSUS BROWNING
YOU FORGET SAID MARGARET I DON'T KNOW MUCH OF BOUCHER BUT THE ONLY TIME I SAW HIM IT WAS NOT HIS OWN SUFFERINGS HE SPOKE OF BUT THOSE OF HIS
SUDDENLY HE LOOKED UP AT HER WITH A WILD SEARCHING INQUIRY IN HIS GLANCE
WHY SAID MARGARET
THEREFORE TO RECTIFY YOUR OPINIONS IN IS THE SCIENCE OF TRADE I'M GLAD SIR SAID HIGGINS WITH A CURIOUS WINK OF HIS EYE THAT YO PUT IN SO THEY THINK
BUT AT LAST HE MOVED TOWARDS THE STAIRS SHE AND HE STOOD BY THE CORPSE
WHICH FIRST SUGGESTED TO MARGARET THE IDEA THAT HE HAD BEEN DRINKING NOT ENOUGH TO INTOXICATE HIMSELF BUT ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS THOUGHTS BEWILDERED BUT SHE WERE YOUNGER THAN ME
NOUGHT CAN HURT HER NOW THEN RAISING HIS VOICE TO A WAILING CRY HE WENT ON
MARGARET POURED OUT THE TEA IN SILENCE TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING AGREEABLE TO SAY
HE LOOKED UP AT HER DEFYINGLY IT'S MY OWN HOUSE STAND OUT O THE WAY WENCH OR I'LL MAKE YO HE HAD SHAKEN OFF MARY WITH VIOLENCE HE LOOKED READY TO STRIKE MARGARET BUT SHE NEVER MOVED A FEATURE NEVER TOOK HER DEEP SERIOUS EYES OFF HIM
THEN MARGARET WAS GLAD THAT SHE HAD COME THE FACE OFTEN SO WEARY WITH PAIN SO RESTLESS WITH TROUBLOUS THOUGHTS HAD NOW THE FAINT SOFT SMILE OF ETERNAL REST UPON IT
AND THAT WAS DEATH IT LOOKED MORE PEACEFUL THAN LIFE ALL BEAUTIFUL SCRIPTURES CAME INTO HER MIND THEY REST FROM THEIR LABOURS THE WEARY ARE AT REST HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP SLOWLY SLOWLY MARGARET TURNED AWAY FROM THE BED
MARGARET FELT THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGED HER POWER WHAT COULD SHE DO NEXT HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON A CHAIR
HE STARED BACK ON HER WITH GLOOMY FIERCENESS IF SHE HAD STIRRED
MISSUS HALE LIFTED HERSELF UP FROM A DOZE WHEN DID YOU WRITE TO FREDERICK MARGARET YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY MAMMA YESTERDAY AND THE LETTER WENT
SUCH TROUBLE AND HAD SUCH NEVER ENDING CARE AND I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK IT WERE ALL A SET O CHANCES THAT MIGHT HA BEEN ALTERED
YE THINK I FORGET WHO'S LYING THERE AND HOW HOO LOVED YO AND
MARY CAME TREMBLING TOWARDS HIM GET THEE GONE GET THEE GONE HE CRIED STRIKING WILDLY AND BLINDLY AT HER WHAT DO I CARE FOR THEE MARGARET TOOK HER HAND AND HELD IT SOFTLY IN HERS HE TORE HIS HAIR
THAT AFTERNOON SHE WALKED SWIFTLY TO THE HIGGINS'S HOUSE MARY WAS LOOKING OUT FOR HER WITH A HALF DISTRUSTFUL FACE MARGARET SMILED INTO HER EYES TO RE ASSURE HER THEY PASSED QUICKLY THROUGH THE HOUSE PLACE UPSTAIRS AND INTO THE QUIET PRESENCE OF THE DEAD
NOR TO THE LEFT WHILE HE TRAMPED ALONG BY MARGARET'S SIDE HE FEARED BEING UPSET BY THE WORDS STILL MORE THE LOOKS OF SYMPATHISING NEIGHBOURS SO HE AND MARGARET WALKED IN SILENCE AS HE GOT NEAR THE STREET IN WHICH HE KNEW SHE LIVED HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS CLOTHES HIS HANDS AND SHOES
DYING SO LONG THAT HE HAD PERSUADED HIMSELF SHE WOULD NOT DIE THAT SHE WOULD PULL THROUGH MARGARET FELT AS IF SHE HAD NO BUSINESS TO BE THERE FAMILIARLY ACQUAINTING HERSELF WITH THE SURROUNDINGS OF DEATH WHICH HE THE FATHER HAD ONLY JUST LEARNT
THOUGH HE HURT HER ARM WITH HIS GRIPE AND WILD GLEAMS CAME ACROSS THE STUPIDITY OF HIS EYES SHE IS DEAD SHE SAID HE LOOKED AT HER STILL WITH THAT SEARCHING LOOK WHICH SEEMED TO FADE OUT OF HIS EYES AS HE GAZED
POOR FELLOW ECHOED MISSUS HALE BUT I ALMOST WISH YOU HAD NOT WRITTEN WOULD IT BE TOO LATE TO STOP HIM IF YOU WROTE AGAIN MARGARET I'M AFRAID IT WOULD MAMMA SAID MARGARET REMEMBERING THE URGENCY WITH WHICH SHE HAD ENTREATED HIM TO COME DIRECTLY IF HE WISHED TO SEE HIS MOTHER ALIVE
NOT YET PAPA I THINK PERHAPS NOT AT ALL LET US ASK HIM ABOUT THE STRIKE AND GIVE HIM ALL THE SYMPATHY HE NEEDS
IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIRABLE BUT MARGARET ASSURED HIM
HE BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE HARD WOOD THEN HE LAY EXHAUSTED AND STUPID STILL HIS DAUGHTER AND MARGARET DID NOT MOVE MARY TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT AT LAST IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN HOUR HE LIFTED HIMSELF UP
SO FAR SO GOOD BUT WHERE WAS MISTER HALE
WHILE HERE NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES FOR US ENOUGH TO NOTICE WHAT WE DO
AT LAST HIGGINS FOUND WORDS MAN I COULD FELL YO TO THE GROUND FOR TEMPTING ME
WHILE HE IS HERE THEY'LL BE CLEVER IF THEY COME IN PAST ME SAID DIXON SHOWING HER TEETH AT THE BARE IDEA
OH MARGARET I'M SO AFRAID OF HIS COMING IF HE SHOULD BE RECOGNISED IF HE SHOULD BE TAKEN IF HE SHOULD BE EXECUTED AFTER ALL THESE YEARS THAT HE HAS KEPT AWAY AND LIVED IN SAFETY I KEEP FALLING ASLEEP AND DREAMING THAT HE IS CAUGHT AND BEING TRIED OH MAMMA DON'T BE AFRAID
YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH RESPECT FOR HIM NOR GAINED MUCH GOOD FROM HAVING HIM IN
MARGARET HOW COULD YOU SAY SO MUTTERED HE REPROACHFULLY
AND THOUGH THY SPIRIT'S LIFE TRIALS UNTOLD ASSAIL WITH GIANT STRENGTH GOOD CHEER GOOD CHEER SOON ENDS THE BITTER STRIFE AND THOU SHALT REIGN IN PEACE WITH CHRIST AT LENGTH
I ALWAYS DISLIKE THAT DOING THINGS IN SUCH A HURRY SAID MISSUS HALE MARGARET WAS SILENT COME NOW MA'AM SAID DIXON WITH A KIND OF CHEERFUL AUTHORITY YOU KNOW SEEING MASTER FREDERICK IS JUST THE VERY THING OF ALL OTHERS YOU'RE LONGING FOR
THE NOISE APPEARED TO ROUSE HIM HE TOOK SUDDEN HOLD OF MARGARET'S ARM AND HELD HER TILL HE COULD GATHER WORDS TO SPEAK
AND A MAN S NO MAN WHO'LL GROAN OUT LOUD
ALONG WI IT COME CRIMES BUT I THINK IT WERE A GREATER CRIME TO LET IT ALONE OUR ONLY CHANCE IS BINDING MEN TOGETHER IN ONE COMMON INTEREST AND IF SOME ARE COWARDS AND SOME ARE FOOLS THEY MUN COME ALONG AND JOIN THE GREAT MARCH WHOSE ONLY STRENGTH IS IN NUMBERS OH
THERE HAD BEEN A PAUSE OF AN INSTANT ON THE STEEP CROOKED STAIR
WOULD HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON STRANGERS FAR AWAY AS THE INJURIES FANCIED OR REAL HAD UPON THEMSELVES
NO REPLIED MARGARET STANDING STILL WITH THE UTMOST PATIENCE NOW SHE FOUND HERSELF PERCEIVED IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE HE SPOKE AGAIN BUT HE KEPT HIS HOLD ON HER ARM ALL MEN MUST DIE SAID HE AT LAST WITH A STRANGE SORT OF GRAVITY
BUT HER CALM FACE FIXED ON HIS PATIENT AND TRUSTFUL COMPELLED HIM TO ANSWER
FAINT SHE'S BEEN SO BEFORE OFTEN SHE IS DEAD REPLIED MARGARET
WE MAY CLEM TO SKIN AND BONE AND
STUDYING THE REALITY OF HER DEATH BRINGING HIMSELF TO UNDERSTAND THAT HER PLACE SHOULD KNOW HER NO MORE
BUT I'LL SEE ABOUT HER BEING SAFE OFF AS SOON AS WE KNOW WHEN HE COMES GOD BLESS HIM SO TAKE YOUR TEA MA'AM IN COMFORT AND TRUST TO ME MISSUS HALE DID TRUST IN DIXON MORE THAN IN MARGARET DIXON'S WORDS QUIETED HER FOR THE TIME
I DON'T EXPECT TO CONVINCE YOU IN A DAY NOT IN ONE CONVERSATION BUT LET US KNOW EACH OTHER AND SPEAK FREELY TO EACH OTHER ABOUT THESE THINGS AND THE TRUTH WILL PREVAIL
I SAID IT WAS A PAINFUL THING AND SO IT WAS CERTAINLY INTERPOSED MISTER WINKLE I SAID I HAD PLEDGED MY WORD AS A GENTLEMAN TO SKIN HIM MY CHARACTER WAS AT STAKE I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE AS AN OFFICER IN HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE I WAS BOUND TO SKIN HIM
I HOPE THAT ERE TRIAL HASN'T BROKE HIS SPIRIT BUT IT LOOKS BAD WERY BAD
YES BUT THAT AIN'T ALL SAID SAM AGAIN DIRECTING HIS MASTER'S ATTENTION TO THE COACH DOOR
WHICH WAS INSTANTANEOUSLY ANSWERED BY A POWDERED HEADED FOOTMAN IN GORGEOUS LIVERY AND OF SYMMETRICAL STATURE IS THIS HERE MISTER BANTAM'S OLD FELLER
BUT THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE THE POSSIBILITIES TO WHICH SHE COULD GIVE NO SHAPE BEGAN TO PRESS UPON HER LIKE THE INVISIBLE WEIGHT OF AIR SHE WAS ALONE ON HER LITTLE ISLAND OF DREAMS AND ALL AROUND HER WAS THE DARK UNKNOWN WATER WHERE ARTHUR WAS GONE
HE WAS BUTTONED UP TO THE CHIN IN A BROWN COAT AND HAD A LARGE SEALSKIN TRAVELLING CAP AND A GREATCOAT AND CLOAK LYING ON THE SEAT BESIDE HIM
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO STEP DOWNSTAIRS CERT'NLY SIR REPLIED MISTER WELLER AND ACTING ON MISTER PICKWICK'S GENTLE HINT SAM RETIRED NO PERKER SAID MISTER PICKWICK WITH GREAT SERIOUSNESS OF MANNER
AND WHO HAVE AN AMALGAMATION OF THEMSELVES AT THE GUILDHALL EVERY FORTNIGHT WHICH IS TO SAY THE LEAST REMARKABLE GOOD BYE GOOD BYE AND PROTESTING ALL THE WAY DOWNSTAIRS THAT HE WAS MOST SATISFIED AND MOST DELIGHTED AND MOST OVERPOWERED AND MOST FLATTERED
AND THAT THE INDIVIDUAL FOR WHOM THE SECOND PLACE WAS TAKEN WAS A PERSONAGE NO LESS ILLUSTRIOUS THAN MISSUS DOWLER HIS LADY WIFE SHE'S A FINE WOMAN SAID MISTER DOWLER I AM PROUD OF HER I HAVE REASON I HOPE I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF JUDGING SAID MISTER PICKWICK WITH A SMILE
NO NOT ALL OF YOU SAID THE STRANGE MAN EMPHATICALLY I'VE TAKEN TWO PLACES IF THEY TRY TO SQUEEZE SIX PEOPLE INTO AN INFERNAL BOX THAT ONLY HOLDS FOUR I'LL TAKE A POST CHAISE AND BRING AN ACTION I'VE PAID MY FARE IT WON'T DO
THAN IT WAS REPLACED BY ANOTHER AS DAINTY AND BEWITCHING IN THE TEA ROOM AND HOVERING ROUND THE CARD TABLES WERE A VAST NUMBER OF QUEER OLD LADIES AND DECREPIT OLD GENTLEMEN DISCUSSING ALL THE SMALL TALK AND SCANDAL OF THE DAY WITH A RELISH AND GUSTO WHICH SUFFICIENTLY BESPOKE
BUT WHEN I SEE YOU'RE BEING MADE LOVE TO BY A GENTLEMAN AS CAN NEVER MARRY YOU AND DOESNA THINK O MARRYING YOU I FEEL BOUND T INTERFERE FOR YOU I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT TO THEM AS ARE THE PLACE O YOUR PARENTS FOR THAT MIGHT BRING WORSE TROUBLE THAN'S NEEDFUL
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHERE SHALL WE GO NEXT MISTER TUPMAN AND MISTER SNODGRASS WERE TOO MUCH AFFECTED BY THEIR FRIEND'S HEROISM TO OFFER ANY REPLY
HIS BOSOM FRIEND HOW DO YOU DO MY LORD
VERY GOOD SAID MISTER PICKWICK UNTIL THAT TIME MY DEAR FELLOW LET ME HEAR NO MORE OF THE MATTER AND NOW CONTINUED MISTER PICKWICK LOOKING ROUND ON HIS FRIENDS WITH A GOOD HUMOURED SMILE AND A SPARKLE IN THE EYE WHICH NO SPECTACLES COULD DIM OR CONCEAL
I HOPE WE SHALL MEET AGAIN SIR SAID THE POWDERED HEADED FOOTMAN RUBBING HIS HANDS AND FOLLOWING SAM OUT TO THE DOOR STEP YOU ARE WERY OBLIGIN SIR REPLIED SAM NOW DON'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE FATIGUED BEYOND YOUR POWERS
THE FRIEND WAS A CHARMING YOUNG MAN OF NOT MUCH MORE THAN FIFTY DRESSED IN A VERY BRIGHT BLUE COAT WITH RESPLENDENT BUTTONS BLACK TROUSERS AND THE THINNEST POSSIBLE PAIR OF HIGHLY POLISHED BOOTS A GOLD EYE GLASS WAS SUSPENDED FROM HIS NECK BY A SHORT BROAD BLACK RIBBON
THE INSIDES CONTRIVED TO BE VERY COMPANIONABLE ALL THE WAY THE OUTSIDES DID AS OUTSIDES ALWAYS DO
SHE WAS REALLY AS ANXIOUS AS ADAM WAS THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SOME PRIVATE TALK WITH HIM SHE WONDERED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF HER AND ARTHUR HE MUST HAVE SEEN THEM KISSING SHE KNEW BUT SHE HAD NO CONCEPTION OF THE SCENE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN ARTHUR AND ADAM
THE NEXT SUNDAY ADAM JOINED THE POYSERS ON THEIR WAY OUT OF CHURCH HOPING FOR AN INVITATION TO GO HOME WITH THEM
ADAM'S WORDS RELIEVED ONE OF HETTY'S FEARS BUT THEY ALSO CARRIED A MEANING WHICH SICKENED HER WITH A STRENGTHENED FOREBODING SHE WAS PALE AND TREMBLING AND YET SHE WOULD HAVE ANGRILY CONTRADICTED ADAM IF SHE HAD DARED TO BETRAY HER FEELINGS
IT RECALLED TO HER THE NECESSITY OF RALLYING HER NATIVE POWERS OF CONCEALMENT WHICH HAD HALF GIVEN WAY UNDER THE SHOCK OF ADAM'S WORDS AND SHE HAD THE LETTER IN HER POCKET SHE WAS SURE THERE WAS COMFORT IN THAT LETTER IN SPITE OF ADAM
THE ONLY OBSERVABLE ALTERATIONS IN HIS APPEARANCE WERE THAT HE WORE A BRIGHTER BLUE COAT WITH A WHITE SILK LINING BLACK TIGHTS BLACK SILK STOCKINGS AND PUMPS AND A WHITE WAISTCOAT AND WAS IF POSSIBLE JUST A THOUGHT MORE SCENTED
THE HORSES IN THE STAGES THAT WERE GOING OUT AND HAD COME THROUGH THE CITY WERE SMOKING SO THAT THE OUTSIDE PASSENGERS WERE INVISIBLE THE NEWSPAPER SELLERS LOOKED MOIST AND SMELLED MOULDY
BUT IT WOULDN'T DO WAITER SAID THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE WHISKERS SIR REPLIED A MAN WITH A DIRTY COMPLEXION AND A TOWEL OF THE SAME EMERGING FROM THE KENNEL BEFORE MENTIONED SOME MORE TOAST YES SIR
I'VE HAD MY DINNER YOU DINE EARLY SIR SAID THE POWDERED HEADED FOOTMAN I FIND I GETS ON BETTER AT SUPPER WHEN I DOES REPLIED SAM HAVE YOU BEEN LONG IN BATH SIR INQUIRED THE POWDERED HEADED FOOTMAN I HAVE NOT HAD THE PLEASURE OF HEARING OF YOU BEFORE
HOW IS THAT SAM SAID MISTER PICKWICK AREN'T THE NAMES DOWN ON THE WAY BILL THE NAMES IS NOT ONLY DOWN ON THE VAY BILL SIR REPLIED SAM BUT THEY'VE PAINTED VUN ON EM UP
IF HE PLAYED A WRONG CARD MISS BOLO LOOKED A SMALL ARMOURY OF DAGGERS IF HE STOPPED TO CONSIDER WHICH WAS THE RIGHT ONE LADY SNUPHANUPH WOULD THROW HERSELF BACK IN HER CHAIR AND SMILE WITH A MINGLED GLANCE OF IMPATIENCE AND PITY
REPORTS OF THE TRIAL IN THOSE CONFOUNDED PAPERS THOUGHT MISTER PICKWICK THEY HAVE HEARD ALL ABOUT ME YOU ARE THE GENTLEMAN RESIDING ON CLAPHAM GREEN RESUMED BANTAM WHO LOST THE USE OF HIS LIMBS FROM IMPRUDENTLY TAKING COLD AFTER PORT WINE
THAT ADAM MIGHT BETRAY WHAT HE KNEW TO HER UNCLE AND AUNT AND HIS SUDDEN PROPOSITION TO TALK WITH HER ALONE HAD SET HER THOUGHTS TO WORK IN A NEW WAY
THOSE WHO KNOW ME BEST BEST KNOW IT CRUSH ME HERE THE FIERCE GENTLEMAN RANG THE BELL WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND TOLD THE WAITER HE'D BETTER BRING THE TOAST IN FIVE SECONDS OR HE'D KNOW THE REASON WHY MY GOOD SIR SAID MISTER PICKWICK
THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES EMERGED FROM HIS CHARIOT AT THE DOOR OF THE ASSEMBLY ROOMS IN THE SAME WIG THE SAME TEETH THE SAME EYE GLASS THE SAME WATCH AND SEALS THE SAME RINGS THE SAME SHIRT PIN AND THE SAME CANE
THE REMEMBRANCE OF THAT SCENE HAD OFTEN BEEN WITH HIM SINCE THURSDAY EVENING
LOW AND GENTLE BUT VERY PLEASANT TO HEAR IN A FEMALE VOICE WHETHER IN BATH OR ELSEWHERE
HUSH DRAW A LITTLE NEARER MISTER PICKWICK YOU SEE THE SPLENDIDLY DRESSED YOUNG MAN COMING THIS WAY
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEAP AT HALF A CROWN A MOUTH IF ANY MODERATE NUMBER OF MOUTHS COULD HAVE EATEN IT IN THE TIME AND AT SEVEN O'CLOCK P M MISTER PICKWICK AND HIS FRIENDS AND MISTER DOWLER AND HIS WIFE RESPECTIVELY RETIRED TO THEIR PRIVATE SITTING ROOMS AT THE WHITE HART HOTEL
NOW JANE SAID MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY TURNING TO ONE OF THE GIRLS WHAT IS IT I CAME TO ASK MA WHETHER I MIGHT DANCE WITH THE YOUNGEST MISTER CRAWLEY WHISPERED THE PRETTIER AND YOUNGER OF THE TWO
THIS HERE SIR REJOINED SAM
THE RED BUNCHES HETTY'S SWEET BLUSH IT CAME IMPORTUNATELY NOW ON THIS SAD EVENING WITH THE LOW HANGING CLOUDS BUT HE TRIED TO SUPPRESS IT LEST SOME EMOTION SHOULD IMPEL HIM TO SAY MORE THAN WAS NEEDFUL FOR HETTY'S SAKE
THIS IS INDEED AN ACQUISITION
AS ARRANGED WITH ENTIRELY NEW MOVEMENTS FOR THAT NOBLE INSTRUMENT THE ORGAN EITHER MOUTH OR BARREL ARRIVING AT THE NUMBER IN QUEEN SQUARE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED HE LEFT OFF WHISTLING AND GAVE A CHEERFUL KNOCK
SAID THE STRANGE MAN I MADE AN OBSERVATION TO MY FRIEND SIR REPLIED MISTER PICKWICK ALWAYS READY TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION I WONDERED AT WHAT HOUSE THE BATH COACH PUT UP PERHAPS YOU CAN INFORM ME ARE YOU GOING TO BATH SAID THE STRANGE MAN
WALKED BACK TO THE GEORGE AND VULTURE WHERE HE WAS PRETTY BUSILY EMPLOYED UNTIL BED TIME IN REDUCING CLOTHES AND LINEN INTO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE COMPASS AND EXERTING HIS MECHANICAL GENIUS IN CONSTRUCTING A VARIETY OF INGENIOUS DEVICES FOR KEEPING THE LIDS ON BOXES WHICH HAD NEITHER LOCKS NOR HINGES
CONSIDER WHAT YOU OWE TO SOCIETY AND DON'T LET YOURSELF BE INJURED BY TOO MUCH WORK FOR THE SAKE O YOUR FELLER CREETURS KEEP YOURSELF AS QUIET AS YOU CAN ONLY THINK WHAT A LOSS YOU WOULD BE WITH THESE PATHETIC WORDS SAM WELLER DEPARTED
MISTER PICKWICK HAPPENED TO BE LOOKING ANOTHER WAY AT THE MOMENT SO HER LADYSHIP NODDED HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM AND FROWNED EXPRESSIVELY MY FRIEND MISTER PICKWICK MY LADY WILL BE MOST HAPPY I AM SURE REMARKABLY SO SAID THE M C TAKING THE HINT
DONE SAID MISTER PICKWICK WHAT SHOULD BE DONE
BANTAM MISTER PICKWICK KNOW EACH OTHER
WILL YOU CONTRIVE FOR ME TO WALK OUT IN THE GARDEN A BIT WITH YOU THIS EVENING IF IT KEEPS FINE HETTY I'VE SOMETHING PARTIC'LAR TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
HE WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE GLAD OF A LITTLE REASONABLE TALK ABOUT BUSINESS THE WHILE AND FOR HIS OWN PART HE WAS CURIOUS TO HEAR THE MOST RECENT NEWS ABOUT THE CHASE FARM SO THROUGH THE REST OF THE WALK HE CLAIMED ADAM'S CONVERSATION FOR HIMSELF
AND AN OLD ONE BEHIND WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH FARMING THERE WAS A CONSTANT SUCCESSION OF CHRISTIAN NAMES IN SMOCK FROCKS AND WHITE COATS WHO WERE INVITED TO HAVE A LIFT BY THE GUARD AND WHO KNEW EVERY HORSE AND HOSTLER ON THE ROAD AND OFF IT AND THERE WAS A DINNER
TO KNOW IF I WASN'T THE POST GLORWIOUS GLORWIOUS AT THIS ANECDOTE HIS LORDSHIP LAUGHED VERY HEARTILY AS DID THE LISTENERS OF COURSE
AND THERE SURE ENOUGH IN GILT LETTERS OF A GOODLY SIZE WAS THE MAGIC NAME OF PICKWICK DEAR ME EXCLAIMED MISTER PICKWICK QUITE STAGGERED BY THE COINCIDENCE WHAT A VERY EXTRAORDINARY THING
NOT ONE HALFPENNY SAID MISTER PICKWICK FIRMLY NOT ONE HALFPENNY HOOROAR FOR THE PRINCIPLE AS THE MONEY LENDER SAID VEN HE VOULDN'T RENEW THE BILL OBSERVED MISTER WELLER WHO WAS CLEARING AWAY THE BREAKFAST THINGS SAM SAID MISTER PICKWICK
MISTER DOWLER PAID HIS BILL AND HURRIED OUT WITH HIS TRAVELLING CAP COAT AND CLOAK AND MISTER PICKWICK AND HIS FRIENDS FOLLOWED TO SECURE THEIR PLACES
CERTAINLY NOT REPLIED MISTER PICKWICK EAGERLY NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT JUMP UP TO YOUR SEAT DIRECTLY I AM WERY MUCH AFEERED MUTTERED SAM TO HIMSELF AS HE TURNED AWAY THAT SOMETHIN QUEER'S COME OVER THE GOVERNOR OR HE'D NEVER HA STOOD THIS SO QUIET
THE FAT OLD LADY INQUIRED MISTER PICKWICK INNOCENTLY
AND AS LONG AS ADAM THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY HOPE OF HER HAVING HIM HE WOULD DO JUST WHAT SHE LIKED SHE KNEW BESIDES SHE MUST GO ON SEEMING TO ENCOURAGE ADAM LEST HER UNCLE AND AUNT SHOULD BE ANGRY AND SUSPECT HER OF HAVING SOME SECRET LOVER
WHO APPLIES HER REFINED INTELLECT TO THE PROBLEM OF COMMITTING INDISCRETIONS WITHOUT COMPROMISING HERSELF PERHAPS THE RESEMBLANCE WAS NOT MUCH THE LESS BECAUSE HETTY FELT VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE WHILE THE PARTING WITH ARTHUR WAS A DOUBLE PAIN TO HER
YOU SHALL REPLIED DOWLER SHE SHALL KNOW YOU SHE SHALL ESTEEM YOU I COURTED HER UNDER SINGULAR CIRCUMSTANCES I WON HER THROUGH A RASH VOW THUS I SAW HER I LOVED HER I PROPOSED SHE REFUSED ME YOU LOVE ANOTHER
YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO OBSERVE THAT THIS IS A VERY UNNECESSARY DISPLAY OF EXCITEMENT I HAVE ONLY TAKEN PLACES INSIDE FOR TWO I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID THE FIERCE MAN I WITHDRAW MY EXPRESSIONS
A LOOKING GLASS AND A LIVE WAITER
AS THE TRUMP CARD WAS TURNED UP AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SECOND DEAL TWO YOUNG LADIES HURRIED INTO THE ROOM AND TOOK THEIR STATIONS ON EITHER SIDE OF MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY'S CHAIR WHERE THEY WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL THE HAND WAS OVER
COS IF IT IS JIST YOU STEP IN TO HIM WITH THAT ERE CARD AND SAY MISTER VELLER'S A WAITIN WILL YOU SAID SAM AND SAYING IT HE VERY COOLLY WALKED INTO THE HALL AND SAT DOWN THE POWDERED HEADED FOOTMAN SLAMMED THE DOOR VERY HARD AND SCOWLED VERY GRANDLY
THEY RETURNED TO THE WHITE HART AND DESPATCHED SAM ON THE ERRAND TO WHICH HIS MASTER HAD PLEDGED HIM SAM WELLER PUT ON HIS HAT IN A VERY EASY AND GRACEFUL MANNER AND THRUSTING HIS HANDS IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKETS WALKED WITH GREAT DELIBERATION TO QUEEN SQUARE
AS IF HE REALLY COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND TO THE TRIAL OF LETTING IT GO AGAIN IT IS A VERY LONG TIME SINCE I DRANK THE WATERS CERTAINLY REPLIED MISTER PICKWICK FOR TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE I WAS NEVER HERE BEFORE
INTO THE TEA ROOM MISTER PICKWICK TURNED AND CATCHING SIGHT OF HIM MISTER BANTAM CORKSCREWED HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD AND WELCOMED HIM WITH ECSTASY MY DEAR SIR I AM HIGHLY HONOURED
FOR SHE HAD TREMBLED WHEN SHE FOUND HE WAS GOING HOME WITH THEM LEST HE SHOULD MEAN TO TELL
AND FROWNING IN A WARNING MANNER UPON THE OTHER SORTED HER CARDS POOR MISTER PICKWICK HE HAD NEVER PLAYED WITH THREE THOROUGH PACED FEMALE CARD PLAYERS BEFORE THEY WERE SO DESPERATELY SHARP THAT THEY QUITE FRIGHTENED HIM
HETTY'S LITTLE BRAIN WAS BUSY WITH THIS COMBINATION AS SHE HUNG ON ADAM'S ARM AND SAID YES OR NO TO SOME SLIGHT OBSERVATIONS OF HIS
THERE WERE JUST TWO PLACES TO BE HAD INSIDE AND JUST THREE TO BE HAD OUT SO SAM WELLER BOOKED FOR THEM ALL AND HAVING EXCHANGED A FEW COMPLIMENTS WITH THE BOOKING OFFICE CLERK ON THE SUBJECT OF A PEWTER HALF CROWN WHICH WAS TENDERED HIM AS A PORTION OF HIS CHANGE
AN INSTANCE OF CONDESCENSION AT WHICH ANGELO BANTAM WAS EVEN MORE OVERPOWERED THAN BEFORE TICKETS OF ADMISSION TO THAT EVENING'S ASSEMBLY WERE TO HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR THE WHOLE PARTY BUT AS THEY WERE NOT READY MISTER PICKWICK UNDERTOOK DESPITE ALL THE PROTESTATIONS TO THE CONTRARY OF ANGELO BANTAM
SO WHAT BETWEEN MISTER DOWLER'S STORIES AND MISSUS DOWLER'S CHARMS
I KNOW THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE I KNOW THEY ARE DONE EVERY DAY
SO I SHOULD THINK REJOINED MISTER PICKWICK DRILY
SHE SHOULD LEARN WHAT HE THOUGHT AND WHAT HE MEANT TO DO SHE FELT A CERTAIN CONFIDENCE THAT SHE COULD PERSUADE HIM NOT TO DO ANYTHING SHE DID NOT WANT HIM TO DO SHE COULD PERHAPS EVEN MAKE HIM BELIEVE THAT SHE DIDN'T CARE FOR ARTHUR
AND AFTER TEA WHEN THE BOYS WERE GOING INTO THE GARDEN AND TOTTY BEGGED TO GO WITH THEM
I KNOW WE SHALL I LIKE YOUR LOOKS THEY PLEASE ME GENTLEMEN YOUR HANDS AND NAMES KNOW ME OF COURSE AN INTERCHANGE OF FRIENDLY SALUTATIONS FOLLOWED THIS GRACIOUS SPEECH AND THE FIERCE GENTLEMAN IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED TO INFORM THE FRIENDS IN THE SAME SHORT ABRUPT
SPARE MY BLUSHES I KNOW HIM YOU DO VERY GOOD IF HE REMAINS HERE I'LL SKIN HIM LORD BLESS ME EXCLAIMED MISTER PICKWICK INVOLUNTARILY DID YOU SKIN THE GENTLEMAN SIR INQUIRED MISTER WINKLE WITH A VERY PALE FACE I WROTE HIM A NOTE
ADAM PAUSED AND LOOKED AT HETTY WHO WAS PLUCKING THE LEAVES FROM THE FILBERT TREES AND TEARING THEM UP IN HER HAND HER LITTLE PLANS AND PRECONCERTED SPEECHES HAD ALL FORSAKEN HER LIKE AN ILL LEARNT LESSON UNDER THE TERRIBLE AGITATION PRODUCED BY ADAM'S WORDS
WITH AND TOTTY WAS WATCHING THEM WITH A PUPPYLIKE AIR OF CONTEMPLATION IT WAS BUT A SHORT TIME HARDLY TWO MONTHS SINCE ADAM HAD HAD HIS MIND FILLED WITH DELICIOUS HOPES AS HE STOOD BY HETTY'S SIDE IN THIS GARDEN
ANGELO BANTAM REJOINED MISTER PICKWICK AND LED HIM INTO THE CARD ROOM JUST AT THE VERY MOMENT OF THEIR ENTRANCE THE DOWAGER LADY SNUPHANUPH AND TWO OTHER LADIES OF AN ANCIENT AND WHIST LIKE APPEARANCE WERE HOVERING OVER AN UNOCCUPIED CARD TABLE
AND MISTER CRUSHTON HAD BEEN REFLECTING WHAT SUBJECT HIS LORDSHIP COULD TALK ABOUT BEST
I SHALL YIELD MYSELF UP WITH PERFECT CHEERFULNESS AND CONTENT OF HEART WHEN CAN THEY DO THIS THEY CAN ISSUE EXECUTION MY DEAR SIR FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE DAMAGES AND TAXED COSTS NEXT TERM REPLIED PERKER JUST TWO MONTHS HENCE MY DEAR SIR
JERKING SENTENCES THAT HIS NAME WAS DOWLER THAT HE WAS GOING TO BATH ON PLEASURE THAT HE WAS FORMERLY IN THE ARMY THAT HE HAD NOW SET UP IN BUSINESS AS A GENTLEMAN THAT HE LIVED UPON THE PROFITS
THE CARDS WERE AGAINST HIM ALSO AND WHEN THEY LEFT OFF AT TEN MINUTES PAST ELEVEN MISS BOLO ROSE FROM THE TABLE CONSIDERABLY AGITATED AND WENT STRAIGHT HOME IN A FLOOD OF TEARS AND A SEDAN CHAIR
MISTER PICKWICK LADY SNUPHANUPH MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY MISS BOLO MISTER PICKWICK BOWED TO EACH OF THE LADIES AND FINDING ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE CUT MISTER PICKWICK AND MISS BOLO AGAINST LADY SNUPHANUPH AND MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY
SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL IN HER PALENESS AND AGITATION WITH HER DARK CHILDISH EYES DILATED AND HER BREATH SHORTER THAN USUAL ADAM'S HEART YEARNED OVER HER AS HE LOOKED AT HER
AND THINK THERE'S NOBODY BUT ME KNOWS ABOUT THIS AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU AS IF I WAS YOUR BROTHER YOU'RE THE SAME AS EVER TO ME FOR I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'VE DONE ANY WRONG KNOWINGLY HETTY HAD LAID HER HAND ON THE LETTER BUT ADAM DID NOT LOOSE IT TILL HE HAD DONE SPEAKING
TO MY SHAME I MUST SAY THAT I AM PERFECTLY SERIOUS REJOINED MISTER PICKWICK I REALLY NEVER WAS HERE BEFORE OH I SEE EXCLAIMED THE GRAND MASTER LOOKING EXTREMELY PLEASED YES YES GOOD GOOD BETTER AND BETTER YOU ARE THE GENTLEMAN OF WHOM WE HAVE HEARD
AND THEY NO SOONER SET EYES UPON MISTER PICKWICK UNDER THE CONVOY OF ANGELO BANTAM THAN THEY EXCHANGED GLANCES WITH EACH OTHER SEEING THAT HE WAS PRECISELY THE VERY PERSON THEY WANTED TO MAKE UP THE RUBBER
ARE MOMENTS SNATCHED FROM PARADISE RENDERED BEWITCHING BY MUSIC BEAUTY ELEGANCE FASHION ETIQUETTE AND AND ABOVE ALL BY THE ABSENCE OF TRADESPEOPLE WHO ARE QUITE INCONSISTENT WITH PARADISE
SHE CLUNG TO THE COMFORTING HOPEFUL WORDS ARTHUR HAD UTTERED IN THEIR LAST MEETING
BUT COMFORT HER AND SOOTHE HER AND SAVE HER FROM THIS PAIN IF HE HAD BUT SOME SORT OF STRENGTH THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO RESCUE HER POOR TROUBLED MIND AS HE WOULD HAVE RESCUED HER BODY IN THE FACE OF ALL DANGER
HETTY SAID NOTHING SHE FELT A REVIVAL OF HOPE AT THE MENTION OF A LETTER WHICH ADAM HAD NOT READ THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT IN IT FROM WHAT HE THOUGHT ADAM TOOK OUT THE LETTER BUT HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND STILL WHILE HE SAID IN A TONE OF TENDER ENTREATY
BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO THROW AWAY AN UNRIPE APPLE THAT SHE HAD SET HER SMALL TEETH IN HEGH TOTTY SAID ADAM COME AND RIDE ON MY SHOULDER EVER SO HIGH YOU'LL TOUCH THE TOPS O THE TREES
OH VERY MUCH SO INDEED SIR SAID THE POWDERED HEADED FOOTMAN TAKING SAM'S REMARKS AS A HIGH COMPLIMENT VERY MUCH SO INDEED DO YOU DO ANYTHING IN THIS WAY SIR INQUIRED THE TALL FOOTMAN PRODUCING A SMALL SNUFF BOX WITH A FOX'S HEAD ON THE TOP OF IT
EVERYTHING WAS FORGOTTEN BUT THE PAIN AND ANGER SHE FELT AT ADAM'S WORDS NAY HETTY SAID ADAM IF HE'D CARED FOR YOU RIGHTLY HE'D NEVER HA BEHAVED SO HE TOLD ME HIMSELF HE MEANT NOTHING BY HIS KISSING AND PRESENTS
A MAIL CART WHAT AN EXCELLENT IDEA RE MARKABLE GWACIOUS HEAVENS SAID HIS LORDSHIP
AND HASTENING WITH A HUMBLE COUNTENANCE TO MISTER BANTAM'S STUDY BY THE BYE WHO EVER KNEW A MAN WHO NEVER READ OR WROTE EITHER WHO HADN'T GOT SOME SMALL BACK PARLOUR WHICH HE WOULD CALL A STUDY THERE IS THE ANSWER SIR

SO MISTER PICKWICK PAUSED IN VAIN WELL SAID THAT GENTLEMAN IF YOU LEAVE ME TO SUGGEST OUR DESTINATION I SAY BATH I THINK NONE OF US HAVE EVER BEEN THERE
THERE WAS ONE YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN AN INDIA RUBBER CLOAK WHO SMOKED CIGARS ALL DAY AND THERE WAS ANOTHER YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN A PARODY UPON A GREATCOAT WHO LIGHTED A GOOD MANY AND FEELING OBVIOUSLY UNSETTLED AFTER THE SECOND WHIFF THREW THEM AWAY WHEN HE THOUGHT NOBODY WAS LOOKING AT HIM
PUTTING ON GLOVES SETTING DOWN CUPS AND SO FORTH
SHE COULD GATHER NO ELATION OF SPIRITS NOW BY LOOKING FORWARD BUT ONLY BY LOOKING BACKWARD TO BUILD CONFIDENCE ON PAST WORDS AND CARESSES BUT OCCASIONALLY SINCE THURSDAY EVENING HER DIM ANXIETIES HAD BEEN ALMOST LOST BEHIND THE MORE DEFINITE FEAR
THE JEWS WITH THE FIFTY BLADED PENKNIVES SHUT THEM UP IN DESPAIR THE MEN WITH THE POCKET BOOKS MADE POCKET BOOKS OF THEM WATCH GUARDS AND TOASTING FORKS WERE ALIKE AT A DISCOUNT AND PENCIL CASES AND SPONGES WERE A DRUG IN THE MARKET
GIRANDOLES AND WAX CANDLES AND IN ALL PARTS OF THE SCENE GLIDING FROM SPOT TO SPOT IN SILENT SOFTNESS
THERE WAS A CRUEL FORCE IN THEIR CALM CERTAINTY WHICH THREATENED TO GRAPPLE AND CRUSH HER FLIMSY HOPES AND FANCIES
LORDSHIP IT IS VERY WARM MY LORD REPLIED THE M C CONFOUNDED ASSENTED THE HONOURABLE MISTER CRUSHTON
AND IN REPLY TO ALL THESE GRAVE CHARGES MISTER PICKWICK WOULD BE WHOLLY UNABLE TO PLEAD ANY JUSTIFICATION WHATEVER HAVING BY THIS TIME FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE GAME PEOPLE CAME AND LOOKED ON TOO WHICH MADE MISTER PICKWICK NERVOUS
SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF WHAT HE SAID SHE HAD NOT LISTENED
FOR FEAR YOU SHOULD BE DECEIVING YOURSELF IT'S NEVER ENTERED HIS HEAD THE THOUGHT O MARRYING YOU HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW DURST YOU SAY SO SAID HETTY PAUSING IN HER WALK AND TREMBLING THE TERRIBLE DECISION OF ADAM'S TONE SHOOK HER WITH FEAR
COME YOU'LL GO ON WITH US ADAM MISTER POYSER SAID WHEN THEY REACHED THE TURNING AND AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN THE FIELDS ADAM VENTURED TO OFFER HIS ARM TO HETTY THE CHILDREN SOON GAVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY OF LINGERING BEHIND A LITTLE AND THEN ADAM SAID
BUT FAILING NOT FROM TIME TO TIME TO CAST AN ANXIOUS SIDELONG GLANCE UPON THEIR DAUGHTERS WHO REMEMBERING THE MATERNAL INJUNCTION TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THEIR YOUTH HAD ALREADY COMMENCED INCIPIENT FLIRTATIONS IN THE MISLAYING SCARVES
WHEN HE KNEW HE COULD NEVER MAKE YOU THE RIGHT AMENDS HE'S BEEN TRIFLING WITH YOU AND MAKING A PLAYTHING OF YOU AND CARING NOTHING ABOUT YOU AS A MAN OUGHT TO CARE YES HE DOES CARE FOR ME I KNOW BETTER NOR YOU HETTY BURST OUT

INQUIRED SAM WELLER NOTHING ABASHED BY THE BLAZE OF SPLENDOUR WHICH BURST UPON HIS SIGHT IN THE PERSON OF THE POWDERED HEADED FOOTMAN WITH THE GORGEOUS LIVERY WHY YOUNG MAN WAS THE HAUGHTY INQUIRY OF THE POWDERED HEADED FOOTMAN
IT IS LONG VERY LONG MISTER PICKWICK SINCE YOU DRANK THE WATERS IT APPEARS AN AGE MISTER PICKWICK RE MARKABLE SUCH WERE THE EXPRESSIONS WITH WHICH ANGELO CYRUS BANTAM ESQUIRE M C TOOK MISTER PICKWICK'S HAND
AFTER WHAT I SAW ON THURSDAY NIGHT HETTY HE BEGAN YOU WON'T THINK ME MAKING TOO FREE IN WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY IF YOU WAS BEING COURTED BY ANY MAN AS UD MAKE YOU HIS WIFE AND I'D KNOWN YOU WAS FOND OF HIM AND MEANT TO HAVE HIM

ONE OF THESE BOXES WAS OCCUPIED ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION BY A STERN EYED MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND FORTY WHO HAD A BALD AND GLOSSY FOREHEAD WITH A GOOD DEAL OF BLACK HAIR AT THE SIDES AND BACK OF HIS HEAD AND LARGE BLACK WHISKERS
WHO CONSIDERED IT EXTREMELY PROBABLE THAT IF MISTER PICKWICK SAW A LITTLE CHANGE AND GAIETY HE WOULD BE INCLINED TO THINK BETTER OF HIS DETERMINATION AND WORSE OF A DEBTOR'S PRISON
MA WHISPERED THE OTHER WHO WAS MUCH OLDER THAN HER SISTER AND VERY INSIPID AND ARTIFICIAL
DRESSES RUSTLED FEATHERS WAVED LIGHTS SHONE AND JEWELS SPARKLED THERE WAS THE MUSIC NOT OF THE QUADRILLE BAND FOR IT HAD NOT YET COMMENCED
WHEN SAM WELLER CAME UP TO HIS MASTER AND WHISPERING IN HIS EAR BEGGED TO SPEAK TO HIM WITH AN AIR OF THE DEEPEST MYSTERY WELL SAM SAID MISTER PICKWICK WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW HERE'S RAYTHER A RUM GO SIR REPLIED SAM WHAT INQUIRED MISTER PICKWICK
PERHAPS YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ME HETTY BECAUSE YOU THINK TOO WELL OF HIM BECAUSE YOU THINK HE LOVES YOU BETTER THAN HE DOES BUT I'VE GOT A LETTER MY POCKET AS HE WROTE HIMSELF FOR ME TO GIVE YOU I'VE NOT READ THE LETTER BUT HE SAYS HE'S TOLD YOU THE TRUTH IN IT
AND LASTLY SEATED ON SOME OF THE BACK BENCHES WHERE THEY HAD ALREADY TAKEN UP THEIR POSITIONS FOR THE EVENING WERE DIVERS UNMARRIED LADIES PAST THEIR GRAND CLIMACTERIC WHO
NOT DANCING BECAUSE THERE WERE NO PARTNERS FOR THEM AND NOT PLAYING CARDS LEST THEY SHOULD BE SET DOWN AS IRRETRIEVABLY SINGLE WERE IN THE FAVOURABLE SITUATION OF BEING ABLE TO ABUSE EVERYBODY WITHOUT REFLECTING ON THEMSELVES IN SHORT THEY COULD ABUSE EVERYBODY BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS THERE
TO SEND SAM FOR THEM AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON TO THE M C S HOUSE IN QUEEN SQUARE HAVING TAKEN A SHORT WALK THROUGH THE CITY AND ARRIVED AT THE UNANIMOUS CONCLUSION THAT PARK STREET WAS VERY MUCH LIKE THE PERPENDICULAR STREETS A MAN SEES IN A DREAM WHICH HE CANNOT GET UP FOR THE LIFE OF HIM
BESIDES ALL THIS THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF DISTRACTING CONVERSATION NEAR THE TABLE BETWEEN ANGELO BANTAM AND THE TWO MISSES MATINTER WHO BEING SINGLE AND SINGULAR PAID GREAT COURT TO THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A STRAY PARTNER NOW AND THEN
BUT I KNOW BETTER NOR THAT I CAN'T HELP THINKING AS YOU'VE BEEN TRUSTING TO HIS LOVING YOU WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY YOU FOR ALL HE'S A GENTLEMAN
A GOLD SNUFF BOX WAS LIGHTLY CLASPED IN HIS LEFT HAND GOLD RINGS INNUMERABLE GLITTERED ON HIS FINGERS AND A LARGE DIAMOND PIN SET IN GOLD GLISTENED IN HIS SHIRT FRILL HE HAD A GOLD WATCH AND A GOLD CURB CHAIN WITH LARGE GOLD SEALS
HIS FEATURES WERE CONTRACTED INTO A PERPETUAL SMILE AND HIS TEETH WERE IN SUCH PERFECT ORDER THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT AT A SMALL DISTANCE TO TELL THE REAL FROM THE FALSE MISTER PICKWICK SAID MISTER DOWLER MY FRIEND ANGELO CYRUS BANTAM ESQUIRE M C
IS IT INDEED SAID MISTER PICKWICK
AND PENDING THE ARRIVAL OF THE TOAST ADVANCED TO THE FRONT OF THE FIRE AND TAKING HIS COAT TAILS UNDER HIS ARMS LOOKED AT HIS BOOTS AND RUMINATED I WONDER WHEREABOUTS IN BATH THIS COACH PUTS UP SAID MISTER PICKWICK MILDLY ADDRESSING MISTER WINKLE HUM EH WHAT'S THAT
ANGELO CYRUS BANTAM ESQUIRE M C STEPPED INTO A VERY ELEGANT CHARIOT THAT WAITED AT THE DOOR AND RATTLED OFF AT THE APPOINTED HOUR MISTER PICKWICK AND HIS FRIENDS ESCORTED BY DOWLER REPAIRED TO THE ASSEMBLY ROOMS AND WROTE THEIR NAMES DOWN IN THE BOOK
BUT SHE WAS SILENT YOU'RE SO YOUNG YOU KNOW HETTY HE WENT ON ALMOST TENDERLY
TO MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY AT WHICH MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY WOULD SHRUG UP HER SHOULDERS AND COUGH AS MUCH AS TO SAY SHE WONDERED WHETHER HE EVER WOULD BEGIN
AND WITH AN EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE WHICH SEEMED TO DENOTE THAT HE WAS GREATLY AMUSED WITH SOMETHING OR OTHER WALKED MERRILY AWAY
BUT THE DETERMINATION TO CONCEAL WHAT SHE FELT STILL GOVERNED HER IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A BLIND PROMPTING NOW FOR SHE WAS UNABLE TO CALCULATE THE EFFECT OF HER WORDS YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO SAY AS I LOVE HIM SHE SAID FAINTLY BUT IMPETUOUSLY PLUCKING ANOTHER ROUGH LEAF AND TEARING IT UP
LEAVING SAM WELLER TO RESCUE THE LUGGAGE FROM THE SEVEN OR EIGHT PORTERS WHO FLUNG THEMSELVES SAVAGELY UPON IT THE MOMENT THE COACH STOPPED AND FINDING THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES TOO EARLY MISTER PICKWICK AND HIS FRIENDS WENT FOR SHELTER INTO THE TRAVELLERS ROOM
GOOD GOD JANE HOW CAN YOU THINK OF SUCH THINGS REPLIED THE MAMMA INDIGNANTLY HAVEN'T YOU REPEATEDLY HEARD THAT HIS FATHER HAS EIGHT HUNDRED A YEAR WHICH DIES WITH HIM I AM ASHAMED OF YOU NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT
ADDED HIS LORDSHIP I DWOVE IT OVER TO BWISTOL THE OTHER MORNING IN A CWIMSON COAT WITH TWO SERVANTS WIDING A QUARTER OF A MILE BEHIND
I WILL REJOINED DOWLER THIS IS A LONG CALL
I REGRETTED THE NECESSITY BUT IT MUST BE DONE HE WAS OPEN TO CONVICTION HE SAW THAT THE RULES OF THE SERVICE WERE IMPERATIVE HE FLED I MARRIED HER HERE'S THE COACH THAT'S HER HEAD
WHY MISTER PICKWICK HAD NOT RETURNED THAT DIAMOND OR LED THE CLUB OR ROUGHED THE SPADE OR FINESSED THE HEART OR LED THROUGH THE HONOUR OR BROUGHT OUT THE ACE OR PLAYED UP TO THE KING OR SOME SUCH THING
ANYBODY HERE INQUIRED DOWLER SUSPICIOUSLY ANYBODY
IT'S ODD ENOUGH CERTAINLY SAM SAID MISTER PICKWICK BUT IF WE STAND TALKING HERE WE SHALL LOSE OUR PLACES
MISTER PICKWICK ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPLIMENT WHICH THE SUPPOSITION IMPLIED BUT HAD THE SELF DENIAL TO REPUDIATE IT NOTWITHSTANDING AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A MOMENT'S SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE M C BEGGED TO INTRODUCE HIS FRIENDS MISTER TUPMAN MISTER WINKLE AND MISTER SNODGRASS
WHICH WAS VERY DIGNIFIED AND HAVING SCRUTINISED THAT GENTLEMAN AND HIS COMPANIONS TO HIS ENTIRE SATISFACTION HUMMED A TUNE
MY FRIENDS HERE HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO DISSUADE ME FROM THIS DETERMINATION BUT WITHOUT AVAIL I SHALL EMPLOY MYSELF AS USUAL UNTIL THE OPPOSITE PARTY HAVE THE POWER OF ISSUING A LEGAL PROCESS OF EXECUTION AGAINST ME AND IF THEY ARE VILE ENOUGH TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF IT AND TO ARREST MY PERSON
STOP IN THE TEA ROOM TAKE YOUR SIXPENN'ORTH THEN LAY ON HOT WATER AND CALL IT TEA DRINK IT SAID MISTER DOWLER IN A LOUD VOICE DIRECTING MISTER PICKWICK WHO ADVANCED AT THE HEAD OF THE LITTLE PARTY WITH MISSUS DOWLER ON HIS ARM
OPPOSITE THE GREAT PUMP ROOM BATH WHERE THE WAITERS FROM THEIR COSTUME MIGHT BE MISTAKEN FOR WESTMINSTER BOYS ONLY THEY DESTROY THE ILLUSION BY BEHAVING THEMSELVES MUCH BETTER BREAKFAST HAD SCARCELY BEEN CLEARED AWAY ON THE SUCCEEDING MORNING WHEN A WAITER BROUGHT IN MISTER DOWLER'S CARD
THE LAST RESOURCE OF HUMAN DEJECTION THE TRAVELLERS ROOM AT THE WHITE HORSE CELLAR IS OF COURSE UNCOMFORTABLE
AND OFTENER AFFECT TO BE BUT IT IS CERTAIN HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF SOME INDEFENSIBLE TREACHERY TO WOMEN AND HAD IN A CERTAIN MYSTERY CALLED MAKING LOVE PRACTISED MANY DECEITS WHICH IF HE HAD USED IN TRADE
TO WHAT HAVE TENDED ALL THOSE ELEGANT AND LUSCIOUS DESCRIPTIONS OF HAPPINESS ARISING FROM VIOLENT AND MUTUAL FONDNESS ALL THOSE WARM PROFESSIONS OF TENDERNESS AND GENEROUS DISINTERESTED LOVE DID YOU IMAGINE SHE WOULD NOT APPLY THEM
OH HOW BITTER A THING IT IS TO LOOK INTO HAPPINESS THROUGH ANOTHER MAN'S EYES THEN ANSWERED ROSALIND STILL IN GANYMEDE'S DRESS AND SPEAKING WITH HIS VOIC IF YOU DO LOVE ROSALIND SO NEAR THE HEART THEN WHEN YOUR BROTHER MARRIES ALIENA
THEN STILL SOBBING HE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND AND LOWERED IT GRADUALLY SEVEN TIMES AS THOUGH HE WERE TOUCHING IN SUCCESSION SEVEN HEADS OF UNEQUAL HEIGHTS
HE WAS NO LONGER EVEN JEAN VALJEAN HE WAS NUMBER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED ONE WHAT BECAME OF HIS SISTER WHAT BECAME OF THE SEVEN CHILDREN WHO TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT THAT
AND THAT THERE WAS A LIONESS CROUCHING NEAR WAITING FOR THE MAN WHO WAS ASLEEP TO WAKE FOR THEY SAY THAT LIONS WILL NOT PREY ON ANYTHING THAT IS DEAD OR SLEEPING THEN ORLANDO LOOKED AT THE MAN AND SAW THAT IT WAS HIS WICKED BROTHER OLIVER WHO HAD TRIED TO TAKE HIS LIFE
I KNOW NOT THROUGH WHAT CHANNELS THE NEWS REACHED HIM SOME ONE WHO HAD KNOWN THEM IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY HAD SEEN HIS SISTER SHE WAS IN PARIS
IF YOU REMEMBER SHE WOULD NOT LET NANCY GO WITH US TO THE MASQUERADE NAY UPON MY HONOUR I THINK SHE'S IN THE RIGHT OF IT SAYS JONES HOWEVER I HAVE TAKEN HER AT HER WORD AND HAVE SENT PARTRIDGE TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER LODGING IF YOU WILL SAYS NIGHTINGALE
FOR I AM SURE THOU ART A VERY GOOD NATURED FELLOW AND SUCH A ONE CAN NEVER BE GUILTY OF A CRUELTY OF THAT KIND BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE PLEASED YOUR OWN VANITY WITHOUT CONSIDERING THAT THIS POOR GIRL WAS MADE A SACRIFICE TO IT
AND WHILE YOU HAVE HAD NO DESIGN BUT OF AMUSING AN IDLE HOUR YOU HAVE ACTUALLY GIVEN HER REASON TO FLATTER HERSELF THAT YOU HAD THE MOST SERIOUS DESIGNS IN HER FAVOUR PRITHEE JACK ANSWER ME HONESTLY
I DO NOT SUPPOSE SO ILL OF YOU NAY I WILL GO FARTHER I DO NOT IMAGINE YOU HAVE LAID A REGULAR PREMEDITATED SCHEME FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE QUIET OF A POOR LITTLE CREATURE OR HAVE EVEN FORESEEN THE CONSEQUENCE
WHO IF CONSIDERED HE SAID AS THEY OUGHT TO BE IN THE LIGHT OF THE DEAREST FRIENDS WERE TO BE CULTIVATED HONOURED AND CARESSED WITH THE UTMOST LOVE AND TENDERNESS BUT IF REGARDED AS ENEMIES
A BIT OF MEAT A SLICE OF BACON THE HEART OF THE CABBAGE TO GIVE TO ONE OF HER CHILDREN AS HE WENT ON EATING WITH HIS HEAD BENT OVER THE TABLE AND ALMOST INTO HIS SOUP HIS LONG HAIR FALLING ABOUT HIS BOWL AND CONCEALING HIS EYES
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE ALSO WAS DISENTANGLING FROM AMID THE VAGUE IDEAS OF A POOR MAN IGNORANT OF EVERYTHING SOMETHING EXCESSIVE WHILE THE BOLT OF HIS IRON COLLAR WAS BEING RIVETED BEHIND HIS HEAD WITH HEAVY BLOWS FROM THE HAMMER
AND AS THEY WERE GOING AWAY SHE TURNED BACK MORE THAN ONCE TO SAY ANOTHER KIND WORD TO THE BRAVE YOUNG MAN GENTLEMAN SHE SAID GIVING HIM A CHAIN FROM HER NECK WEAR THIS FOR ME
THREE YEARS FOR THOSE FOUR HOURS NINETEEN YEARS IN OCTOBER EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN HE WAS RELEASED HE HAD ENTERED THERE IN SEVENTEEN NINETY SIX FOR HAVING BROKEN A PANE OF GLASS
BUT TIME AND ABSENCE WILL SOON WEAR OFF SUCH IMPRESSIONS IT IS A RECEIPT I MUST TAKE MYSELF FOR TO CONFESS THE TRUTH TO YOU I NEVER LIKED ANY GIRL HALF SO MUCH IN MY WHOLE LIFE BUT I MUST LET YOU INTO THE WHOLE SECRET TOM
THREE YEARS FOR THIS FRESH ATTEMPT SIXTEEN YEARS FINALLY I THINK IT WAS DURING HIS THIRTEENTH YEAR HE MADE A LAST ATTEMPT AND ONLY SUCCEEDED IN GETTING RETAKEN AT THE END OF FOUR HOURS OF ABSENCE
DRESSED UP AS A YOUNG COUNTRYMAN AND HER COUSIN AS A COUNTRY GIRL AND ROSALIND SAID THAT SHE WOULD BE CALLED GANYMEDE AND CELIA ALIENA THEY WERE VERY TIRED WHEN AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE FOREST OF ARDEN
AND CAN KEEP CHAIRS WAITING AT YOUR DOOR TILL TWO IN THE MORNING HE THEN RAN ON WITH MUCH COMMONPLACE RAILLERY OF THE SAME KIND TILL JONES AT LAST INTERRUPTED HIM SAYING I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE RECEIVED ALL THIS INFORMATION FROM MISSUS MILLER
WHO HATH BEEN UP HERE A LITTLE WHILE AGO TO GIVE ME WARNING THE GOOD WOMAN IS AFRAID IT SEEMS OF THE REPUTATION OF HER DAUGHTERS OH SHE IS WONDERFULLY NICE SAYS NIGHTINGALE UPON THAT ACCOUNT
THE FAMILY HAD NO BREAD NO BREAD LITERALLY SEVEN CHILDREN
AS THE POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR THE DISASTER OF A DESTINY CLAUDE GUEUX HAD STOLEN A LOAF JEAN VALJEAN HAD STOLEN A LOAF ENGLISH STATISTICS PROVE THE FACT THAT FOUR THEFTS OUT OF FIVE IN LONDON
HIS SISTER WORKED ALSO BUT WHAT COULD SHE DO WITH SEVEN LITTLE CHILDREN IT WAS A SAD GROUP ENVELOPED IN MISERY WHICH WAS BEING GRADUALLY ANNIHILATED A VERY HARD WINTER CAME JEAN HAD NO WORK
OR SPEAK INGENUOUSLY
AND WITHIN A MONTH FROM HIS DECEASE I WAS MARRIED TO A CLERGYMAN
I LOVE ALIENA SO WELL THAT I WILL GIVE UP MY ESTATES TO YOU AND MARRY HER AND LIVE HERE AS A SHEPHERD LET YOUR WEDDING BE TO MORROW SAID ORLANDO AND I WILL ASK THE DUKE AND HIS FRIENDS
IN THE SIXTH YEAR HIS TURN TO ESCAPE OCCURRED AGAIN HE AVAILED HIMSELF OF IT BUT COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH HIS FLIGHT FULLY HE WAS MISSING AT ROLL CALL THE CANNON WERE FIRED
NEVERTHELESS WE WILL REMARK CURSORILY THERE IS STILL AN ABYSS BETWEEN THESE RACES OF MEN AND THE HIDEOUS ASSASSIN OF THE TOWNS THE POACHER LIVES IN THE FOREST THE SMUGGLER LIVES IN THE MOUNTAINS OR ON THE SEA
THIS WAS DONE SIMPLY AS A DUTY AND EVEN A LITTLE CHURLISHLY ON THE PART OF JEAN VALJEAN THUS HIS YOUTH HAD BEEN SPENT IN RUDE AND ILL PAID TOIL HE HAD NEVER KNOWN A KIND WOMAN FRIEND IN HIS NATIVE PARTS
AND THE GIRLS SENT OUT OF THE ROOM THAN THE WIDOW WITHOUT MUCH PREFACE BEGAN AS FOLLOWS WELL THERE ARE VERY SURPRIZING THINGS HAPPEN IN THIS WORLD BUT CERTAINLY IT IS A WONDERFUL BUSINESS THAT I SHOULD HAVE A RELATION OF MISTER ALLWORTHY IN MY HOUSE
AS OTHERS HAD BEEN SO THEY SPOKE TO HIM AND ASKED HIM NOT TO ATTEMPT SO DANGEROUS AN ADVENTURE BUT THE ONLY EFFECT OF THEIR WORDS WAS TO MAKE HIM WISH MORE TO COME OFF WELL IN THE ENCOUNTER SO AS TO WIN PRAISE FROM SUCH SWEET LADIES
NO ANSWERED JONES I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU MAKE LOVE TO HER AS YOU HAVE OFTEN DONE IN MY PRESENCE I HAVE BEEN ASTONISHED AT THE BLINDNESS OF HER MOTHER IN NEVER SEEING IT
WAS ANNOUNCED IN PARIS ON THAT SAME DAY A GREAT GANG OF GALLEY SLAVES WAS PUT IN CHAINS AT BICETRE JEAN VALJEAN FORMED A PART OF THAT GANG AN OLD TURNKEY OF THE PRISON WHO IS NOW NEARLY EIGHTY YEARS OLD
WAS A SISTER OLDER THAN HIMSELF A WIDOW WITH SEVEN CHILDREN BOYS AND GIRLS THIS SISTER HAD BROUGHT UP JEAN VALJEAN AND SO LONG AS SHE HAD A HUSBAND SHE LODGED AND FED HER YOUNG BROTHER THE HUSBAND DIED
I DO FROM MY HEART ANSWERED JONES OF HAVING DEBAUCHED THE GIRL BUT NOT FROM HAVING GAINED HER AFFECTIONS IF I HAVE SAID NIGHTINGALE I AM SORRY FOR IT
HE HAD NEITHER EATEN NOR SLEPT FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS THE MARITIME TRIBUNAL CONDEMNED HIM FOR THIS CRIME TO A PROLONGATION OF HIS TERM FOR THREE YEARS WHICH MADE EIGHT YEARS
INDEED JACK SAID JONES YOU WILFULLY MISUNDERSTAND ME
HE DID NOT CARE MUCH WHETHER HE LIVED OR DIED BUT NOW THE SIGHT OF THE FAIR ROSALIND GAVE HIM STRENGTH AND COURAGE SO THAT HE DID MARVELOUSLY AND AT LAST THREW CHARLES TO SUCH A TUNE THAT THE WRESTLER HAD TO BE CARRIED OFF THE GROUND
A FLASH AS THOUGH A WINDOW HAD SUDDENLY BEEN OPENED UPON THE DESTINY OF THOSE THINGS WHOM HE HAD LOVED THEN ALL CLOSED AGAIN HE HEARD NOTHING MORE FOREVER NOTHING FROM THEM EVER REACHED HIM AGAIN HE NEVER BEHELD THEM
NIGHTINGALE ANSWERED WHAT THE DEVIL WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO
HE HAD A GUN WHICH HE USED BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD HE WAS A BIT OF A POACHER AND THIS INJURED HIS CASE THERE EXISTS A LEGITIMATE PREJUDICE AGAINST POACHERS THE POACHER LIKE THE SMUGGLER SMACKS TOO STRONGLY OF THE BRIGAND
IF THERE BE TRUTH IN SIGHT HE SAID YOU ARE MY ROSALIND I WILL HAVE NO FATHER IF YOU BE NOT HE SHE SAID TO THE DUKE AND TO ORLANDO I WILL HAVE NO HUSBAND IF YOU BE NOT HE
A FARMER'S WIFE NAMED MARIE CLAUDE THE VALJEAN CHILDREN HABITUALLY FAMISHED SOMETIMES WENT TO BORROW FROM MARIE CLAUDE A PINT OF MILK IN THEIR MOTHER'S NAME WHICH THEY DRANK BEHIND A HEDGE OR IN SOME ALLEY CORNER SNATCHING THE JUG FROM EACH OTHER SO HASTILY
STILL RECALLS PERFECTLY THAT UNFORTUNATE WRETCH WHO WAS CHAINED TO THE END OF THE FOURTH LINE IN THE NORTH ANGLE OF THE COURTYARD HE WAS SEATED ON THE GROUND LIKE THE OTHERS HE DID NOT SEEM TO COMPREHEND HIS POSITION EXCEPT THAT IT WAS HORRIBLE
NOR WOULD I TO PROCURE PLEASURE TO MYSELF BE KNOWINGLY THE CAUSE OF MISERY TO ANY HUMAN BEING WELL WELL SAID NIGHTINGALE I BELIEVE YOU AND I AM CONVINCED YOU ACQUIT ME OF ANY SUCH THING
AND AS THEY WERE SITTING ON THE GRASS A COUNTRYMAN PASSED THAT WAY AND GANYMEDE ASKED HIM IF HE COULD GET THEM FOOD HE DID SO AND TOLD THEM THAT A SHEPHERD'S FLOCKS AND HOUSE WERE TO BE SOLD
AND AFTER A SHORT SALUTATION SAID SO TOM I HEAR YOU HAD COMPANY VERY LATE LAST NIGHT UPON MY SOUL YOU ARE A HAPPY FELLOW
WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD BUT AS SHE ENTERED THE PRINTING OFFICE AT SIX AND THE SCHOOL ONLY OPENED AT SEVEN THE CHILD HAD TO WAIT IN THE COURTYARD FOR THE SCHOOL TO OPEN FOR AN HOUR ONE HOUR OF A WINTER NIGHT IN THE OPEN AIR
HAD BEEN A GOOD FRIEND TO THE BANISHED DUKE SO THAT FREDERICK HEARD WITH REGRET WHOSE SON ORLANDO WAS AND WOULD NOT BEFRIEND HIM BUT ROSALIND WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT THIS HANDSOME YOUNG STRANGER WAS THE SON OF HER FATHER'S OLD FRIEND
HAVE HUNGER FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE CAUSE JEAN VALJEAN HAD ENTERED THE GALLEYS SOBBING AND SHUDDERING HE EMERGED IMPASSIVE
SO ORLANDO AND ROSALIND WERE MARRIED AND OLIVER AND CELIA AND THEY LIVED HAPPY EVER AFTER RETURNING WITH THE DUKE TO THE KINGDOM FOR FREDERICK HAD BEEN SHOWN BY A HOLY HERMIT THE WICKEDNESS OF HIS WAYS AND SO GAVE BACK THE DUKEDOM OF HIS BROTHER
HELPLESS FRIENDLESS ORPHANS TO THE CARE OR RATHER TO THE CRUELTY OF THE WORLD YOU MUST KNOW SIR THOUGH I AM NOW REDUCED TO GET MY LIVING BY LETTING LODGINGS I WAS BORN AND BRED A GENTLEWOMAN MY FATHER WAS AN OFFICER OF THE ARMY
OF A SMOKING ROOF OF A PASSING MAN OF A BARKING DOG OF A GALLOPING HORSE OF A STRIKING CLOCK OF THE DAY BECAUSE ONE CAN SEE OF THE NIGHT BECAUSE ONE CANNOT SEE OF THE HIGHWAY OF THE PATH OF A BUSH OF SLEEP
PRESSING HIMSELF CLOSE TO THE CAT THAT HE MIGHT SUFFER LESS FROM COLD AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THE SCHOOL OPENED AND HE ENTERED THAT IS WHAT WAS TOLD TO JEAN VALJEAN THEY TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT FOR ONE DAY IT WAS A MOMENT
AND HAVING INHERITED A VAST FORTUNE FROM HER FATHER WHICH HE HAD GOT BY PAWNBROKING WAS MARRIED TO A GENTLEMAN OF GREAT ESTATE AND FASHION SHE USED MY SISTER SO BARBAROUSLY OFTEN UPBRAIDING HER WITH HER BIRTH AND POVERTY
I WOULD NOT ANSWERED NIGHTINGALE UNDERGO THE PAIN OF TAKING LEAVE FOR TEN THOUSAND POUNDS BESIDES I AM CONVINCED INSTEAD OF ANSWERING ANY GOOD PURPOSE IT WOULD ONLY SERVE TO INFLAME MY POOR NANCY THE MORE
WHAT AN OMINOUS MINUTE IS THAT IN WHICH SOCIETY DRAWS BACK AND CONSUMMATES THE IRREPARABLE ABANDONMENT OF A SENTIENT BEING
MY FATHER HATH PROVIDED A MATCH FOR ME WITH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW AND SHE IS NOW COMING TO TOWN IN ORDER FOR ME TO MAKE MY ADDRESSES TO HER AT THESE WORDS JONES BURST INTO A LOUD FIT OF LAUGHTER
AND HIMSELF WENT INTO A MONASTERY TO PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS THE WEDDING WAS A MERRY ONE IN THE MOSSY GLADES OF THE FOREST A SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDESS WHO HAD BEEN FRIENDS WITH ROSALIND WHEN SHE WAS HERSELF DISGUISED AS A SHEPHERD WERE MARRIED ON THE SAME DAY
UPON MY SOUL TOM CRIES NIGHTINGALE
WHAT BECOMES OF THE HANDFUL OF LEAVES FROM THE YOUNG TREE WHICH IS SAWED OFF AT THE ROOT IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME STORY THESE POOR LIVING BEINGS THESE CREATURES OF GOD HENCEFORTH WITHOUT SUPPORT WITHOUT GUIDE WITHOUT REFUGE
WAS PUNISHED BY AN ADDITION OF FIVE YEARS TWO OF THEM IN THE DOUBLE CHAIN THIRTEEN YEARS IN THE TENTH YEAR HIS TURN CAME ROUND AGAIN HE AGAIN PROFITED BY IT HE SUCCEEDED NO BETTER
THAT THE LITTLE GIRLS SPILLED IT ON THEIR APRONS AND DOWN THEIR NECKS IF THEIR MOTHER HAD KNOWN OF THIS MARAUDING SHE WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THE DELINQUENTS SEVERELY JEAN VALJEAN GRUFFLY AND GRUMBLINGLY PAID MARIE CLAUDE FOR THE PINT OF MILK BEHIND THEIR MOTHER'S BACK
AND THE CHILDREN WERE NOT PUNISHED IN PRUNING SEASON HE EARNED EIGHTEEN SOUS A DAY THEN HE HIRED OUT AS A HAY MAKER AS LABORER AS NEAT HERD ON A FARM AS A DRUDGE HE DID WHATEVER HE COULD
FOR THAT GOOD WOMAN HAVING LEARNT EITHER BY MEANS OF PARTRIDGE OR BY SOME OTHER MEANS NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL THAT HE HAD A CONNEXION WITH MISTER ALLWORTHY COULD NOT ENDURE THE THOUGHTS OF PARTING WITH HIM IN AN ANGRY MANNER JONES ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
WHO HAUNTS THESE WOODS AND HANGS SONNETS ON THE TREES IF I COULD FIND HIM I WOULD SOON CURE HIM OF HIS FOLLY ORLANDO CONFESSED THAT HE WAS THE FOOLISH LOVER
HE WEPT HIS TEARS STIFLED HIM THEY IMPEDED HIS SPEECH HE ONLY MANAGED TO SAY FROM TIME TO TIME
ALAS SIR YOU LITTLE IMAGINE WHAT A FRIEND THAT BEST OF GENTLEMEN HATH BEEN TO ME AND MINE YES SIR I AM NOT ASHAMED TO OWN IT IT IS OWING TO HIS GOODNESS THAT I DID NOT LONG SINCE PERISH FOR WANT AND LEAVE MY POOR LITTLE WRETCHES TWO DESTITUTE
THAT YOU HAVE MADE HER DAUGHTER DISTRACTEDLY IN LOVE WITH YOU THE POOR GIRL CANNOT CONCEAL IT A MOMENT HER EYES ARE NEVER OFF FROM YOU AND SHE ALWAYS COLOURS EVERY TIME YOU COME INTO THE ROOM INDEED I PITY HER HEARTILY
HE NEVER MET THEM AGAIN AND IN THE CONTINUATION OF THIS MOURNFUL HISTORY THEY WILL NOT BE MET WITH ANY MORE TOWARDS THE END OF THIS FOURTH YEAR JEAN VALJEAN'S TURN TO ESCAPE ARRIVED
HE FOUGHT WITH THE LIONESS AND KILLED HER AND SAVED HIS BROTHER'S LIFE WHILE ORLANDO WAS FIGHTING THE LIONESS OLIVER WOKE TO SEE HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HAD TREATED SO BADLY SAVING HIM FROM A WILD BEAST AT THE RISK OF HIS OWN LIFE
SO I AM GOING TO PALL MALL AND DO YOU INTEND TO MAKE A SECRET OF YOUR GOING AWAY SAID JONES I PROMISE YOU ANSWERED NIGHTINGALE I DON'T INTEND TO BILK MY LODGINGS BUT I HAVE A PRIVATE REASON FOR NOT TAKING A FORMAL LEAVE
THAT IS TO SAY THE LARGER HALF OF A SHOULDER OF MUTTON
ORLANDO LIKE ROSALIND'S FATHER WAS BEING KEPT OUT OF HIS INHERITANCE BY HIS BROTHER AND WAS SO SAD AT HIS BROTHER'S UNKINDNESS THAT
HE HAD NOT HAD THE TIME TO FALL IN LOVE HE RETURNED AT NIGHT WEARY AND ATE HIS BROTH WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HIS SISTER MOTHER JEANNE OFTEN TOOK THE BEST PART OF HIS REPAST FROM HIS BOWL WHILE HE WAS EATING
BUT WHEN GANYMEDE HEARD OF THE DANGER ORLANDO HAD BEEN IN SHE FAINTED AND WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF SAID TRULY ENOUGH I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A WOMAN BY RIGHT OLIVER WENT BACK TO HIS BROTHER AND TOLD HIM ALL THIS SAYING
YOU MUST LEAVE THE COURT AT ONCE HE SAID TO ROSALIND WHY SHE ASKED NEVER MIND WHY ANSWERED THE DUKE YOU ARE BANISHED IF WITHIN TEN DAYS YOU ARE FOUND WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF MY COURT YOU DIE
WHICH WE HOPE WILL BE VERY ATTENTIVELY PERUSED BY YOUNG PEOPLE OF BOTH SEXES PARTRIDGE HAD NO SOONER LEFT MISTER JONES THAN MISTER NIGHTINGALE WITH WHOM HE HAD NOW CONTRACTED A GREAT INTIMACY CAME TO HIM
AND BEING KINDLY RECEIVED STAYED WITH HIM NOW ORLANDO COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT ROSALIND AND HE WENT ABOUT THE FOREST CARVING HER NAME ON TREES AND WRITING LOVE SONNETS AND HANGING THEM ON THE BUSHES AND THERE ROSALIND AND CELIA FOUND THEM
HE THEN TOLD NIGHTINGALE HE SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO LODGE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM AND IT WAS ACCORDINGLY AGREED BETWEEN THEM THAT NIGHTINGALE SHOULD PROCURE HIM EITHER THE GROUND FLOOR
CHARLES A CELEBRATED WRESTLER WAS THERE WHO HAD KILLED MANY MEN IN CONTESTS OF THIS KIND ORLANDO THE YOUNG MAN HE WAS TO WRESTLE WITH WAS SO SLENDER AND YOUTHFUL THAT ROSALIND AND CELIA THOUGHT HE WOULD SURELY BE KILLED
SO HE SENT HIS BROTHER TO ASK GANYMEDE TO COME TO HIM OLIVER WENT AND TOLD THE WHOLE STORY TO GANYMEDE AND ALIENA AND ALIENA WAS SO CHARMED WITH HIS MANLY WAY OF CONFESSING HIS FAULTS THAT SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM AT ONCE
JEAN VALJEAN WAS PRONOUNCED GUILTY THE TERMS OF THE CODE WERE EXPLICIT THERE OCCUR FORMIDABLE HOURS IN OUR CIVILIZATION THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THE PENAL LAWS DECREE A SHIPWRECK
HE HAD THE AIR OF PERCEIVING NOTHING AND ALLOWING IT
AND SHE HAD THE FINE AND SECRET JOY OF KNOWING THAT ALL HIS LOVE WORDS CAME TO THE RIGHT EARS THUS MANY DAYS PASSED PLEASANTLY AWAY ONE MORNING AS ORLANDO WAS GOING TO VISIT GANYMEDE HE SAW A MAN ASLEEP ON THE GROUND
HIS COMRADES ASSISTED HIM AS IS THE CUSTOM IN THAT SAD PLACE HE ESCAPED HE WANDERED FOR TWO DAYS IN THE FIELDS AT LIBERTY IF BEING AT LIBERTY IS TO BE HUNTED TO TURN THE HEAD EVERY INSTANT TO QUAKE AT THE SLIGHTEST NOISE TO BE AFRAID OF EVERYTHING
SHALL YOU MARRY HER NOW THE NEXT DAY THE DUKE AND HIS FOLLOWERS AND ORLANDO AND OLIVER AND ALIENA WERE ALL GATHERED TOGETHER FOR THE WEDDING THEN GANYMEDE CAME IN AND SAID TO THE DUKE
AND IN THE EVENING OR TO MORROW MORNING I INTEND TO DEPART JONES PROMISED HE WOULD NOT AND SAID UPON REFLECTION HE THOUGHT AS HE HAD DETERMINED AND WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE HER HE TOOK THE MOST PRUDENT METHOD
AND DIED IN A CONSIDERABLE RANK BUT HE LIVED UP TO HIS PAY AND AS THAT EXPIRED WITH HIM HIS FAMILY AT HIS DEATH BECAME BEGGARS WE WERE THREE SISTERS ONE OF US HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO DIE SOON AFTER OF THE SMALL POX
THE ELDEST OF THE SEVEN CHILDREN WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD THE YOUNGEST ONE JEAN VALJEAN HAD JUST ATTAINED HIS TWENTY FIFTH YEAR HE TOOK THE FATHER'S PLACE AND IN HIS TURN SUPPORTED THE SISTER WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP
HE HAD LOST HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AT A VERY EARLY AGE HIS MOTHER HAD DIED OF A MILK FEVER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY ATTENDED TO HIS FATHER A TREE PRUNER LIKE HIMSELF HAD BEEN KILLED BY A FALL FROM A TREE
AND WHAT IS MORE RARE AMONG YOUNG GENTLEMEN OF THE TOWN ONE OF STRICT HONESTY TOO YET IN AFFAIRS OF LOVE HE WAS SOMEWHAT LOOSE IN HIS MORALS NOT THAT HE WAS EVEN HERE AS VOID OF PRINCIPLE AS GENTLEMEN SOMETIMES ARE
NOT SO PRIVATE ANSWERED JONES
TOM TOM ANSWERED NIGHTINGALE LAST NIGHT REMEMBER LAST NIGHT WHEN EVERY EYE WAS CLOSED AND THE PALE MOON AND SILENT STARS SHONE CONSCIOUS OF THE THEFT LOOKEE MISTER NIGHTINGALE SAID JONES
SHE HAD WITH HER ONLY ONE CHILD A LITTLE BOY THE YOUNGEST WHERE WERE THE OTHER SIX PERHAPS SHE DID NOT KNOW HERSELF EVERY MORNING SHE WENT TO A PRINTING OFFICE
THAN TO VALUE HIMSELF UPON IT CHAPTER FIVE A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE HISTORY OF MISSUS MILLER JONES THIS DAY EAT A PRETTY GOOD DINNER FOR A SICK MAN
WANDERED AWAY AT RANDOM WHO EVEN KNOWS EACH IN HIS OWN DIRECTION PERHAPS AND LITTLE BY LITTLE BURIED THEMSELVES IN THAT COLD MIST WHICH ENGULFS SOLITARY DESTINIES GLOOMY SHADES INTO WHICH DISAPPEAR IN SUCCESSION SO MANY UNLUCKY HEADS
IF I BRING IN YOUR DAUGHTER ROSALIND WILL YOU GIVE HER TO ORLANDO HERE THAT I WOULD SAID THE DUKE IF I HAD ALL KINGDOMS TO GIVE WITH HER AND YOU SAY YOU WILL HAVE HER WHEN I BRING HER
I AM NO CANTING HYPOCRITE NOR DO I PRETEND TO THE GIFT OF CHASTITY MORE THAN MY NEIGHBOURS I HAVE BEEN GUILTY WITH WOMEN I OWN IT
ONE DAY ORLANDO MET THEM BUT HE DID NOT KNOW ROSALIND IN HER BOY'S CLOTHES THOUGH HE LIKED THE PRETTY SHEPHERD YOUTH BECAUSE HE FANCIED A LIKENESS IN HIM TO HER HE LOVED THERE IS A FOOLISH LOVER SAID ROSALIND
IN THAT HEART WHERE THERE HAD BEEN A WOUND THERE WAS A SCAR THAT IS ALL ONLY ONCE DURING ALL THE TIME WHICH HE SPENT AT TOULON DID HE HEAR HIS SISTER MENTIONED THIS HAPPENED I THINK TOWARDS THE END OF THE FOURTH YEAR OF HIS CAPTIVITY
FOR THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HIMSELF WAS TO OCCUPY THAT WHICH WAS BETWEEN THEM THIS NIGHTINGALE OF WHOM WE SHALL BE PRESENTLY OBLIGED TO SAY A LITTLE MORE WAS IN THE ORDINARY TRANSACTIONS OF LIFE A MAN OF STRICT HONOUR
HIS FATHER WAS CALLED JEAN VALJEAN OR VLAJEAN PROBABLY A SOBRIQUET
IT WAS JEAN VALJEAN THIS TOOK PLACE IN SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE
CROUCHED DOWN AND DOUBLED UP OVER HIS BASKET WHEN IT RAINED AN OLD WOMAN THE PORTRESS TOOK PITY ON HIM SHE TOOK HIM INTO HER DEN WHERE THERE WAS A PALLET A SPINNING WHEEL AND TWO WOODEN CHAIRS AND THE LITTLE ONE SLUMBERED IN A CORNER
THAT WOULD I HE ANSWERED WERE I KING OF ALL KINGDOMS THEN ROSALIND AND CELIA WENT OUT AND ROSALIND PUT ON HER PRETTY WOMAN'S CLOTHES AGAIN AND AFTER A WHILE CAME BACK SHE TURNED TO HER FATHER
THE CITIES MAKE FEROCIOUS MEN BECAUSE THEY MAKE CORRUPT MEN THE MOUNTAIN THE SEA THE FOREST MAKE SAVAGE MEN THEY DEVELOP THE FIERCE SIDE BUT OFTEN WITHOUT DESTROYING THE HUMANE SIDE
WE MAY I BELIEVE BE AGAIN TOGETHER FOR TO TELL YOU A SECRET WHICH I DESIRE YOU WON'T MENTION IN THE FAMILY I INTEND TO QUIT THE HOUSE TO DAY WHAT HATH MISSUS MILLER GIVEN YOU WARNING TOO MY FRIEND CRIES JONES NO ANSWERED THE OTHER
THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW THE CHILD TO COME INTO THE PRINTING OFFICE BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE WAY THEY SAID WHEN THE WORKMEN PASSED IN THE MORNING THEY BEHELD THIS POOR LITTLE BEING SEATED ON THE PAVEMENT OVERCOME WITH DROWSINESS AND OFTEN FAST ASLEEP IN THE SHADOW
DUKE FREDERICK WAS PLEASED WITH HIS COURAGE AND ASKED HIS NAME MY NAME IS ORLANDO AND I AM THE YOUNGEST SON OF SIR ROWLAND DE BOYS SAID THE YOUNG MAN NOW SIR ROWLAND DE BOYS WHEN HE WAS ALIVE
I GIVE MYSELF TO YOU FOR I AM YOURS IF THERE BE TRUTH IN SIGHT HE SAID YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER THEN SHE SAID TO ORLANDO I GIVE MYSELF TO YOU FOR I AM YOURS
THE VICTORY OF MONTENOTTE WON BY THE GENERAL IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY OF ITALY WHOM THE MESSAGE OF THE DIRECTORY TO THE FIVE HUNDRED
AND AT NIGHT THE PATROL FOUND HIM HIDDEN UNDER THE KEEL OF A VESSEL IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION HE RESISTED THE GALLEY GUARDS WHO SEIZED HIM ESCAPE AND REBELLION THIS CASE PROVIDED FOR BY A SPECIAL CODE
THOU WILT MAKE AN ADMIRABLE PARSON SO I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD NOT GO TO BED TO NANCY NOW IF SHE WOULD LET YOU NO CRIES JONES
AND ALL WITH SUCH PRETTY FEASTINGS AND MERRYMAKINGS AS COULD BE NOWHERE WITHIN FOUR WALLS
SO ROSALIND SET OUT TO SEEK HER FATHER THE BANISHED DUKE IN THE FOREST OF ARDEN CELIA LOVED HER TOO MUCH TO LET HER GO ALONE AND AS IT WAS RATHER A DANGEROUS JOURNEY ROSALIND BEING THE TALLER
HERE WILL BE SOME WET EYES ON YOUR DEPARTURE POOR NANCY I PITY HER FAITH INDEED JACK YOU HAVE PLAYED THE FOOL WITH THAT GIRL YOU HAVE GIVEN HER A LONGING WHICH I AM AFRAID NOTHING WILL EVER CURE HER OF
I COULD GIVE MORE BUT THAT MY HAND LACKS MEANS ROSALIND AND CELIA WHEN THEY WERE ALONE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT THE HANDSOME WRESTLER
JEAN VALJEAN WAS OF THAT THOUGHTFUL BUT NOT GLOOMY DISPOSITION WHICH CONSTITUTES THE PECULIARITY OF AFFECTIONATE NATURES ON THE WHOLE HOWEVER
IN THE SOMBRE MARCH OF THE HUMAN RACE THEY QUITTED THE COUNTRY THE CLOCK TOWER OF WHAT HAD BEEN THEIR VILLAGE FORGOT THEM THE BOUNDARY LINE OF WHAT HAD BEEN THEIR FIELD FORGOT THEM AFTER A FEW YEARS RESIDENCE IN THE GALLEYS
THEY BOUGHT THESE AND SETTLED DOWN AS SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDESS IN THE FOREST IN THE MEANTIME OLIVER HAVING SOUGHT TO TAKE HIS BROTHER ORLANDO'S LIFE ORLANDO ALSO WANDERED INTO THE FOREST
AND TAKEN A LOAF OF BREAD ROOM FOR A BRIEF PARENTHESIS THIS IS THE SECOND TIME DURING HIS STUDIES ON THE PENAL QUESTION AND DAMNATION BY LAW THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK HAS COME ACROSS THE THEFT OF A LOAF OF BREAD
THIS MADE HIM REPENT OF HIS WICKEDNESS AND HE BEGGED ORLANDO'S PARDON AND FROM THENCEFORTH THEY WERE DEAR BROTHERS THE LIONESS HAD WOUNDED ORLANDO'S ARM SO MUCH THAT HE COULD NOT GO ON TO SEE THE SHEPHERD
HE SET OUT FOR TOULON HE ARRIVED THERE AFTER A JOURNEY OF TWENTY SEVEN DAYS ON A CART WITH A CHAIN ON HIS NECK AT TOULON HE WAS CLOTHED IN THE RED CASSOCK ALL THAT HAD CONSTITUTED HIS LIFE EVEN TO HIS NAME WAS EFFACED
AND WOULD OFTEN BOAST OF HIS SKILL IN GAINING OF WOMEN AND HIS TRIUMPHS OVER THEIR HEARTS FOR WHICH HE HAD BEFORE THIS TIME RECEIVED SOME REBUKES FROM JONES WHO ALWAYS EXPREST GREAT BITTERNESS AGAINST ANY MISBEHAVIOUR TO THE FAIR PART OF THE SPECIES
WAS PREPARING TO GO TO BED WHEN HE HEARD A VIOLENT BLOW ON THE GRATED FRONT OF HIS SHOP HE ARRIVED IN TIME TO SEE AN ARM PASSED THROUGH A HOLE MADE BY A BLOW FROM A FIST THROUGH THE GRATING AND THE GLASS
OH JONES JONES I WISH I HAD A FORTUNE IN MY OWN POSSESSION I HEARTILY WISH YOU HAD CRIES JONES FOR IF THIS BE THE CASE I SINCERELY PITY YOU BOTH BUT SURELY YOU DON'T INTEND TO GO AWAY WITHOUT TAKING YOUR LEAVE OF HER
CALLING HER IN DERISION A GENTLEWOMAN THAT I BELIEVE SHE AT LENGTH BROKE THE HEART OF THE POOR GIRL IN SHORT SHE LIKEWISE DIED WITHIN A TWELVEMONTH AFTER MY FATHER FORTUNE THOUGHT PROPER TO PROVIDE BETTER FOR ME
WHERE SHE WAS A FOLDER AND STITCHER SHE WAS OBLIGED TO BE THERE AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING LONG BEFORE DAYLIGHT IN WINTER IN THE SAME BUILDING WITH THE PRINTING OFFICE THERE WAS A SCHOOL AND TO THIS SCHOOL SHE TOOK HER LITTLE BOY
HE HAD NOT LEARNED TO READ IN HIS CHILDHOOD
THE ARM SEIZED A LOAF OF BREAD AND CARRIED IT OFF ISABEAU RAN OUT IN HASTE THE ROBBER FLED AT THE FULL SPEED OF HIS LEGS ISABEAU RAN AFTER HIM AND STOPPED HIM THE THIEF HAD FLUNG AWAY THE LOAF BUT HIS ARM WAS STILL BLEEDING
BUT AS THE WORLD I KNOW NOT WELL FOR WHAT REASON AGREE TO SEE THIS TREACHERY IN A BETTER LIGHT HE WAS SO FAR FROM BEING ASHAMED OF HIS INIQUITIES OF THIS KIND THAT HE GLORIED IN THEM
AND I WILL TAKE HER PART AND BE WAYWARD AND CONTRARY AS IS THE WAY OF WOMEN TILL I MAKE YOU ASHAMED OF YOUR FOLLY IN LOVING HER AND SO EVERY DAY HE WENT TO HER HOUSE AND TOOK A PLEASURE IN SAYING TO HER ALL THE PRETTY THINGS HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO ROSALIND
SAID CELIA WRESTLE WITH THY AFFECTIONS OH ANSWERED ROSALIND THEY TAKE THE PART OF A BETTER WRESTLER THAN MYSELF LOOK HERE COMES THE DUKE WITH HIS EYES FULL OF ANGER SAID CELIA
BEFORE THESE CALLERS WERE GONE THE BROTHER OF THE WIDOW STEAVENS WHO LIVED ON THE BLACK HAWK ROAD DREW UP AT OUR DOOR AND AFTER HIM CAME THE FATHER OF THE GERMAN FAMILY OUR NEAREST NEIGHBORS ON THE SOUTH THEY DISMOUNTED AND JOINED US IN THE DINING ROOM

WHEN SPRING CAME AFTER THAT HARD WINTER ONE COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THE NIMBLE AIR EVERY MORNING I WAKENED WITH A FRESH CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WINTER WAS OVER THERE WERE NONE OF THE SIGNS OF SPRING FOR WHICH I USED TO WATCH IN VIRGINIA NO BUDDING WOODS OR BLOOMING GARDENS
SHE GREETED ME GAYLY AND BEGAN AT ONCE TO TELL ME HOW MUCH PLOUGHING SHE HAD DONE THAT DAY AMBROSCH SHE SAID WAS ON THE NORTH QUARTER BREAKING SOD WITH THE OXEN JIM YOU ASK JAKE HOW MUCH HE PLOUGHED TO DAY I DON'T WANT THAT JAKE GET MORE DONE IN ONE DAY THAN ME
GRANDFATHER HAD EXPLAINED TO AMBROSCH THAT SOME DAY WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS PUT UNDER FENCE AND THE ROADS WERE CONFINED TO SECTION LINES TWO ROADS WOULD CROSS EXACTLY ON THAT CORNER BUT AMBROSCH ONLY SAID IT MAKES NO MATTER
WHEN THE SUN WAS DROPPING LOW ANTONIA CAME UP THE BIG SOUTH DRAW WITH HER TEAM HOW MUCH OLDER SHE HAD GROWN IN EIGHT MONTHS SHE HAD COME TO US A CHILD AND NOW SHE WAS A TALL STRONG YOUNG GIRL ALTHOUGH HER FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY HAD JUST SLIPPED BY
I THINK EMMALINE HE CONCLUDED I WILL ASK ANTONIA TO COME OVER AND HELP YOU IN THE KITCHEN SHE WILL BE GLAD TO EARN SOMETHING AND IT WILL BE A GOOD TIME TO END MISUNDERSTANDINGS I MAY AS WELL RIDE OVER THIS MORNING AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
OTTO PRETENDED NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANTONIA'S BEHAVIOR HE ONLY LIFTED HIS BROWS AND SAID YOU CAN'T TELL ME ANYTHING NEW ABOUT A CZECH I'M AN AUSTRIAN GRANDFATHER WAS NEVER A PARTY TO WHAT JAKE CALLED OUR FEUD WITH THE SHIMERDAS
THEN IF MISSUS SHIMERDA WAS INCLINED TO MAKE TROUBLE HER SON WAS STILL UNDER AGE SHE WOULD BE FORESTALLED
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL BLUE MORNING THE BUFFALO PEAS WERE BLOOMING IN PINK AND PURPLE MASSES ALONG THE ROADSIDE AND THE LARKS PERCHED ON LAST YEAR'S DRIED SUNFLOWER STALKS WERE SINGING STRAIGHT AT THE SUN THEIR HEADS THROWN BACK AND THEIR YELLOW BREASTS A QUIVER
AMBROSCH WORKED IT OUT IN HIS SHREWD HEAD THAT JAKE HAD TO SELL HIS PIG TO PAY HIS FINE THIS THEORY AFFORDED THE SHIMERDAS GREAT SATISFACTION APPARENTLY FOR WEEKS AFTERWARD WHENEVER JAKE AND I MET ANTONIA ON HER WAY TO THE POST OFFICE
IF HE CAN SPARE SIX DOLLARS PINCHED AS HE IS IT SHOWS HE BELIEVES WHAT HE PROFESSES IT WAS GRANDFATHER WHO BROUGHT ABOUT A RECONCILIATION WITH THE SHIMERDAS
SHE STARTED AND CLUTCHED THE ROPE TIGHTER SEEING THAT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND GRANDFATHER TURNED BACK YOU NEED NOT PAY ME ANYTHING MORE NO MORE MONEY THE COW IS YOURS PAY NO MORE
AND I WOULD NEVER BE THE ONE TO SAY YOU WERE NOT IN GOD'S CARE WHEN YOU WERE AMONG THE SOLDIERS AFTER DINNER IT WAS DECIDED THAT YOUNG JELINEK SHOULD HOOK OUR TWO STRONG BLACK FARMHORSES TO THE SCRAPER AND BREAK A ROAD THROUGH TO THE SHIMERDAS SO THAT A WAGON COULD GO WHEN IT WAS NECESSARY
THEY WERE ALL EAGER FOR ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE SUICIDE AND THEY WERE GREATLY CONCERNED AS TO WHERE MISTER SHIMERDA WOULD BE BURIED THE NEAREST CATHOLIC CEMETERY WAS AT BLACK HAWK
AND I FEEL SAD FOR HIS FAMILY WE HAD LISTENED ATTENTIVELY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO ADMIRE HIS FRANK MANLY FAITH I AM ALWAYS GLAD TO MEET A YOUNG MAN WHO THINKS SERIOUSLY ABOUT THESE THINGS SAID GRANDFATHER
I WANT THEM TO COME OVER AND HELP ME CUT MY OATS AND WHEAT NEXT MONTH I WILL PAY THEM WAGES GOOD MORNING BY THE WAY MISSUS SHIMERDA
GRANDFATHER CHUCKLED SAYING HE HAD RATHER EXPECTED SHE WOULD FOLLOW THE MATTER UP JAKE PAID HIS FINE WITH A TEN DOLLAR BILL GRANDFATHER HAD GIVEN HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT WHEN THE SHIMERDAS FOUND THAT JAKE SOLD HIS PIG IN TOWN THAT DAY
ALL DAY LONG OUR PRIEST GO ABOUT THERE TO GIVE THE SACRAMENT TO DYING MEN AND I GO WITH HIM TO CARRY THE VESSELS WITH THE HOLY SACRAMENT EVERYBODY THAT GO NEAR THAT CAMP CATCH THE SICKNESS BUT ME AND THE PRIEST BUT WE HAVE NO SICKNESS WE HAVE NO FEAR
WE RODE AWAY LAUGHING AND GRANDFATHER SAID
I WAS GETTING EVEN WITH ANTONIA FOR HER INDIFFERENCE SINCE THE FATHER'S DEATH AMBROSCH WAS MORE THAN EVER THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE AND HE SEEMED TO DIRECT THE FEELINGS AS WELL AS THE FORTUNES OF HIS WOMEN FOLK ANTONIA OFTEN QUOTED HIS OPINIONS TO ME
JAKE LAUGHED SHEEPISHLY I DON'T WANT TO HAVE NO TROUBLE WITH AMBROSCH IF HE'LL LET ME ALONE I'LL LET HIM ALONE IF HE SLAP YOU WE AIN'T GOT NO PIG FOR PAY THE FINE SHE SAID INSINUATINGLY
AS IF THEY ACHED GRANDMOTHER HAD SAID HEAVY FIELD WORK'LL SPOIL THAT GIRL SHE'LL LOSE ALL HER NICE WAYS AND GET ROUGH ONES SHE HAD LOST THEM ALREADY AFTER SUPPER I RODE HOME THROUGH THE SAD SOFT SPRING TWILIGHT
HIS TONE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD ALREADY DECIDED FOR ME AFTER BREAKFAST WE SET OFF TOGETHER
I AIN'T A GOING TO CARRY SUCH A LOOKING THING BACK TO MISTER BURDEN AMBROSCH DROPPED THE COLLAR ON THE GROUND ALL RIGHT HE SAID COOLLY TOOK UP HIS OIL CAN AND BEGAN TO CLIMB THE MILL JAKE CAUGHT HIM BY THE BELT OF HIS TROUSERS AND YANKED HIM BACK
I RAN OUT AND MET HER AS SHE BROUGHT HER HORSES UP TO THE WINDMILL TO WATER THEM SHE WORE THE BOOTS HER FATHER HAD SO THOUGHTFULLY TAKEN OFF BEFORE HE SHOT HIMSELF AND HIS OLD FUR CAP HER OUTGROWN COTTON DRESS SWITCHED ABOUT HER CALVES OVER THE BOOT TOPS
HE SAY I BREAK HIS SAW WHEN WE BUILD AND I NEVER GRUMBLED AMBROSCH I KNEW HE HAD BROKEN THE SAW AND THEN HID IT AND LIED ABOUT IT I BEGAN TO WISH I HAD NOT STAYED FOR SUPPER EVERYTHING WAS DISAGREEABLE TO ME
INDEED HE WAS NEVER THE SAME HORSE AFTERWARD
OFF ACROSS THE POND IN THE DRAW HEAD AMBROSCH WAS UP ON THE WINDMILL TOWER OILING THE WHEEL HE CAME DOWN NOT VERY CORDIALLY WHEN JAKE ASKED FOR THE COLLAR HE GRUNTED AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
THE WIND BLEW ABOUT US IN WARM SWEET GUSTS WE RODE SLOWLY WITH A PLEASANT SENSE OF SUNDAY INDOLENCE WE FOUND THE SHIMERDAS WORKING JUST AS IF IT WERE A WEEK DAY MAREK WAS CLEANING OUT THE STABLE AND ANTONIA AND HER MOTHER WERE MAKING GARDEN
ON MONDAY ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER JAKE HAD STARTED WE SAW MISSUS SHIMERDA AND HER AMBROSCH PROUDLY DRIVING BY LOOKING NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR LEFT AS THEY RATTLED OUT OF SIGHT DOWN THE BLACK HAWK ROAD
I WONDERED WHY FUCHS HAD NOT STUCK TO CABINET WORK HE SETTLED DOWN TO IT WITH SUCH EASE AND CONTENT HE HANDLED THE TOOLS AS IF HE LIKED THE FEEL OF THEM AND WHEN HE PLANED HIS HANDS WENT BACK AND FORTH OVER THE BOARDS IN AN EAGER BENEFICENT WAY AS IF HE WERE BLESSING THEM
HER NECK CAME UP STRONGLY OUT OF HER SHOULDERS LIKE THE BOLE OF A TREE OUT OF THE TURF
WHEN I RODE UP TO THE SHIMERDAS ONE BRIGHT WINDY AFTERNOON IN APRIL YULKA RAN OUT TO MEET ME IT WAS TO HER NOW THAT I GAVE READING LESSONS ANTONIA WAS BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS
HAD HELD A MEETING AND DECIDED THAT THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD COULD NOT EXTEND ITS HOSPITALITY TO MISTER SHIMERDA GRANDMOTHER WAS INDIGNANT IF THESE FOREIGNERS ARE SO CLANNISH MISTER BUSHY WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE AN AMERICAN GRAVEYARD THAT WILL BE MORE LIBERAL MINDED
HE FOUND MISSUS SHIMERDA SITTING BY THE HORSE WITH HER LANTERN GROANING AND WRINGING HER HANDS IT TOOK BUT A FEW MOMENTS TO RELEASE THE GASES PENT UP IN THE POOR BEAST AND THE TWO WOMEN HEARD THE RUSH OF WIND AND SAW THE ROAN VISIBLY DIMINISH IN GIRTH
HE WAS BADLY FRIGHTENED CERTAINLY AND PERHAPS HE EVEN FELT SOME STIRRINGS OF REMORSE FOR HIS INDIFFERENCE TO THE OLD MAN'S MISERY AND LONELINESS AT SUPPER THE MEN ATE LIKE VIKINGS AND THE CHOCOLATE CAKE WHICH I HAD HOPED WOULD LINGER ON UNTIL TO MORROW IN A MUTILATED CONDITION
THERE WAS ONLY SPRING ITSELF THE THROB OF IT THE LIGHT RESTLESSNESS
SINCE WINTER I HAD SEEN VERY LITTLE OF ANTONIA SHE WAS OUT IN THE FIELDS FROM SUN UP UNTIL SUN DOWN IF I RODE OVER TO SEE HER WHERE SHE WAS PLOUGHING
ANTONIA HAD GONE DOWN TO THE BARN ONE NIGHT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED AND SHE NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE ROANS WAS SWOLLEN ABOUT THE MIDDLE AND STOOD WITH ITS HEAD HANGING SHE MOUNTED ANOTHER HORSE WITHOUT WAITING TO SADDLE HIM
HE SEEMED TO REMEMBER HEARING THERE HAD ONCE BEEN SUCH A CUSTOM IN BOHEMIA MISSUS SHIMERDA IS MADE UP HER MIND HE ADDED I TRY TO PERSUADE HER AND SAY IT LOOKS BAD FOR HER TO ALL THE NEIGHBORS BUT SHE SAY SO IT MUST BE
THESE FOREIGNERS AIN'T THE SAME YOU CAN'T TRUST EM TO BE FAIR IT'S DIRTY TO KICK A FELLER YOU HEARD HOW THE WOMEN TURNED ON YOU
I REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW HE STRODE INTO OUR KITCHEN IN HIS FELT BOOTS AND LONG WOLFSKIN COAT HIS EYES AND CHEEKS BRIGHT WITH THE COLD AT SIGHT OF GRANDMOTHER HE SNATCHED OFF HIS FUR CAP GREETING HER IN A DEEP ROLLING VOICE WHICH SEEMED OLDER THAN HE
GRANDMOTHER SAID YES M FUCHS ADMITTED WITH MODEST PRIDE SO FEW FOLKS DOES KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GOOD TIGHT BOX THAT'LL TURN WATER I SOMETIMES WONDER IF THERE'LL BE ANYBODY ABOUT TO DO IT FOR ME
MISSUS SHIMERDA DROPPED THE ROPE RAN AFTER US AND CROUCHING DOWN BESIDE GRANDFATHER SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND KISSED IT I DOUBT IF HE HAD EVER BEEN SO MUCH EMBARRASSED BEFORE I WAS A LITTLE STARTLED TOO SOMEHOW THAT SEEMED TO BRING THE OLD WORLD VERY CLOSE
THIS WHAT YOU WANT HE ASKED SURLILY JAKE JUMPED OFF HIS HORSE I SAW A WAVE OF RED COME UP UNDER THE ROUGH STUBBLE ON HIS FACE THAT AIN'T THE PIECE OF HARNESS I LOANED YOU AMBROSCH OR IF IT IS YOU'VE USED IT SHAMEFUL
WHILE SHE UNHARNESSED HER TEAM WE WALKED SLOWLY BACK TOWARD THE HOUSE AMBROSCH HAD COME IN FROM THE NORTH QUARTER AND WAS WATERING HIS OXEN AT THE TANK ANTONIA TOOK MY HAND
IF HE MAKE TALK ABOUT FIFTEEN DOLLARS I SEND HIM BACK THE COW
I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISSUS BURDEN FOR THAT YOU ARE SO KIND TO POOR STRANGERS FROM MY KAWN TREE HE DID NOT HESITATE LIKE A FARMER BOY BUT LOOKED ONE EAGERLY IN THE EYE WHEN HE SPOKE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS WARM AND SPONTANEOUS
WHEN AMBROSCH CAME BACK FROM MISTER BUSHY'S WE LEARNED THAT HE HAD GIVEN MAREK'S WAGES TO THE PRIEST AT BLACK HAWK FOR MASSES FOR THEIR FATHER'S SOUL GRANDMOTHER THOUGHT ANTONIA NEEDED SHOES MORE THAN MISTER SHIMERDA NEEDED PRAYERS BUT GRANDFATHER SAID TOLERANTLY
GOOD MORNING MISSUS SHIMERDA CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I WILL FIND AMBROSCH WHICH FIELD HE WITH THE SOD CORN SHE POINTED TOWARD THE NORTH STILL STANDING IN FRONT OF THE COW AS IF SHE HOPED TO CONCEAL IT
HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS TOOLS AT FIRST BUT FIGURED FOR A LONG WHILE ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND MEASURED THE PLANKS AND MADE MARKS ON THEM WHILE HE WAS THUS ENGAGED HE WHISTLED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF OR TEASINGLY PULLED AT HIS HALF EAR
DISAPPEARED ON THE SECOND ROUND THEY TALKED EXCITEDLY ABOUT WHERE THEY SHOULD BURY MISTER SHIMERDA I GATHERED THAT THE NEIGHBORS WERE ALL DISTURBED AND SHOCKED ABOUT SOMETHING IT DEVELOPED THAT MISSUS SHIMERDA AND AMBROSCH WANTED THE OLD MAN BURIED ON THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THEIR OWN LAND
AND HAMMERED ON OUR DOOR JUST AS WE WERE GOING TO BED GRANDFATHER ANSWERED HER KNOCK HE DID NOT SEND ONE OF HIS MEN BUT RODE BACK WITH HER HIMSELF
THEY HAD FOUR COMFORTABLE ROOMS TO LIVE IN A NEW WINDMILL BOUGHT ON CREDIT A CHICKEN HOUSE AND POULTRY MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD PAID GRANDFATHER TEN DOLLARS FOR A MILK COW AND WAS TO GIVE HIM FIFTEEN MORE AS SOON AS THEY HARVESTED THEIR FIRST CROP
MAKING ME FEEL THAT SHE WAS NOW GROWN UP AND HAD NO TIME FOR ME ON SUNDAYS SHE HELPED HER MOTHER MAKE GARDEN OR SEWED ALL DAY GRANDFATHER WAS PLEASED WITH ANTONIA WHEN WE COMPLAINED OF HER HE ONLY SMILED AND SAID
THERE WAS A BURYING GROUND OVER BY THE NORWEGIAN CHURCH WEST OF SQUAW CREEK PERHAPS THE NORWEGIANS WOULD TAKE MISTER SHIMERDA IN
FUCHS WHO WAS THE ONLY CABINET MAKER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS SET TO WORK ON A COFFIN JELINEK PUT ON HIS LONG WOLFSKIN COAT AND WHEN WE ADMIRED IT HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD SHOT AND SKINNED THE COYOTES AND THE YOUNG MAN WHO BATCHED WITH HIM
BECAUSE WE CARRY THAT BLOOD AND THAT BODY OF CHRIST AND IT PRESERVE US HE PAUSED LOOKING AT GRANDFATHER THAT I KNOW MISTER BURDEN FOR IT HAPPENED TO MYSELF ALL THE SOLDIERS KNOW TOO WHEN WE WALK ALONG THE ROAD
WHAT THE CHURCH TEACH SEEM PLAIN TO ME BY N BY WAR TIMES COME WHEN THE AUSTRIANS FIGHT US WE HAVE VERY MANY SOLDIERS IN CAMP NEAR MY VILLAGE AND THE CHOLERA BREAK OUT IN THAT CAMP AND THE MEN DIE LIKE FLIES
GRANDFATHER SMILED TO HIMSELF WHILE HE TIED HIS HORSE AND WE FOLLOWED HER BEHIND THE BARN WE CAME UPON A FUNNY SIGHT THE COW HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN GRAZING SOMEWHERE IN THE DRAW MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD RUN TO THE ANIMAL PULLED UP THE LARIAT PIN
I TOLD HER ADDING THAT HE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE A DRY SPRING AND THAT THE CORN WOULD NOT BE HELD BACK BY TOO MUCH RAIN AS IT HAD BEEN LAST YEAR SHE GAVE ME A SHREWD GLANCE HE NOT JESUS SHE BLUSTERED HE NOT KNOW ABOUT THE WET
KEEP COW SHE ASKED IN A BEWILDERED TONE HER NARROW EYES SNAPPING AT US IN THE SUNLIGHT EXACTLY PAY NO MORE KEEP COW HE NODDED
AMBROSCH'S FEET HAD SCARCELY TOUCHED THE GROUND WHEN HE LUNGED OUT WITH A VICIOUS KICK AT JAKE'S STOMACH FORTUNATELY JAKE WAS IN SUCH A POSITION THAT HE COULD DODGE IT THIS WAS NOT THE SORT OF THING COUNTRY BOYS DID WHEN THEY PLAYED AT FISTICUFFS AND JAKE WAS FURIOUS
BEFORE WE REACHED THE STABLE I FELT SOMETHING TENSE IN HER SILENCE AND GLANCING UP I SAW THAT SHE WAS CRYING SHE TURNED HER FACE FROM ME AND LOOKED OFF AT THE RED STREAK OF DYING LIGHT OVER THE DARK PRAIRIE I CLIMBED UP INTO THE LOFT AND THREW DOWN THE HAY FOR HER
THE ONE IDEA THAT HAD EVER GOT THROUGH POOR MAREK'S THICK HEAD WAS THAT ALL EXERTION WAS MERITORIOUS HE ALWAYS BORE DOWN ON THE HANDLES OF THE CULTIVATOR AND DROVE THE BLADES SO DEEP INTO THE EARTH THAT THE HORSES WERE SOON EXHAUSTED
GRANDMOTHER MOVED ABOUT QUIETLY SO AS NOT TO DISTURB HIM AT LAST HE FOLDED HIS RULER AND TURNED A CHEERFUL FACE TO US
HE BROKE OUT NOW AND THEN INTO GERMAN HYMNS AS IF THIS OCCUPATION BROUGHT BACK OLD TIMES TO HIM AT FOUR O'CLOCK MISTER BUSHY THE POSTMASTER WITH ANOTHER NEIGHBOR WHO LIVED EAST OF US STOPPED IN TO GET WARM THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO THE SHIMERDAS
OUR HEAVY CARPENTER'S BENCH HAD TO BE BROUGHT FROM THE BARN AND CARRIED DOWN INTO THE KITCHEN FUCHS SELECTED BOARDS FROM A PILE OF PLANKS GRANDFATHER HAD HAULED OUT FROM TOWN IN THE FALL TO MAKE A NEW FLOOR FOR THE OATS BIN WHEN AT LAST THE LUMBER AND TOOLS WERE ASSEMBLED
NOWADAYS TONY COULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT THE PRICES OF THINGS OR HOW MUCH SHE COULD LIFT AND ENDURE
GRANDFATHER HEARD OUR STORY WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE HE ADVISED JAKE TO RIDE TO TOWN TO MORROW
I HOPE YOUR GRANDPA AIN'T LOSE NO STACKS NO WE DID N'T I CAME TO ASK YOU SOMETHING TONY GRANDMOTHER WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU CAN'T GO TO THE TERM OF SCHOOL THAT BEGINS NEXT WEEK OVER AT THE SOD SCHOOLHOUSE SHE SAYS THERE'S A GOOD TEACHER AND YOU'D LEARN A LOT
TWO SWEDES HAD FELL OUT OF THAT BUCKET ONCE AND HIT THE WATER FEET DOWN
AND THE DOORS WERE CLOSED AGAIN AND THE COLD DRAFTS SHUT OUT GRANDFATHER RODE AWAY TO MEET THE CORONER AT THE SHIMERDAS AND FUCHS TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND SETTLED DOWN TO WORK I SAT ON HIS WORK TABLE AND WATCHED HIM
ONE MORNING HE TOLD US THAT THE SMALL GRAIN WAS COMING ON SO WELL HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BEGIN TO CUT HIS WHEAT ON THE FIRST OF JULY HE WOULD NEED MORE MEN AND IF IT WERE AGREEABLE TO EVERY ONE HE WOULD ENGAGE AMBROSCH FOR THE REAPING AND THRASHING AS THE SHIMERDAS HAD NO SMALL GRAIN OF THEIR OWN
AFTER I BEGAN TO GO TO THE COUNTRY SCHOOL I SAW LESS OF THE BOHEMIANS WE WERE SIXTEEN PUPILS AT THE SOD SCHOOLHOUSE AND WE ALL CAME ON HORSEBACK AND BROUGHT OUR DINNER MY SCHOOLMATES WERE NONE OF THEM VERY INTERESTING BUT I SOMEHOW FELT THAT BY MAKING COMRADES OF THEM
AND WHEN WE CAME UPON HER SHE WAS TRYING TO HIDE THE COW IN AN OLD CAVE IN THE BANK
HIS SOD CORN WILL BE GOOD FOR FODDER THIS WINTER SAID GRANDFATHER ENCOURAGINGLY AND WHERE IS ANTONIA SHE GO WITH MISSUS SHIMERDA KEPT WIGGLING HER BARE FEET ABOUT NERVOUSLY IN THE DUST VERY WELL I WILL RIDE UP THERE
THEIR FATHER HAS DONE A GREAT SIN HE LOOKED STRAIGHT AT GRANDFATHER OUR LORD HAS SAID THAT GRANDFATHER SEEMED TO LIKE HIS FRANKNESS WE BELIEVE THAT TOO JELINEK BUT WE BELIEVE THAT MISTER SHIMERDA'S SOUL WILL COME TO ITS CREATOR AS WELL OFF WITHOUT A PRIEST
LAW LAW SHE SHRIEKED AFTER US LAW FOR KNOCK MY AMBROSCH DOWN I NEVER LIKE YOU NO MORE JAKE AND JIM BURDEN ANTONIA PANTED NO FRIENDS ANY MORE
FUCHS BROUGHT HOME WITH HIM A STRANGER A YOUNG BOHEMIAN WHO HAD TAKEN A HOMESTEAD NEAR BLACK HAWK AND WHO CAME ON HIS ONLY HORSE TO HELP HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN IN THEIR TROUBLE THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW ANTON JELINEK
UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS TALKED DEAR WOMAN TO HERSELF OR TO THE LORD IF THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO LISTEN BUT GRANDFATHER WAS NATURALLY TACITURN
THEY AIN'T TO BE TRUSTED I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GET TOO THICK WITH ANY OF EM
JAKE STOPPED AND TURNED HIS HORSE FOR A SECOND WELL YOU'RE A DAMNED UNGRATEFUL LOT THE WHOLE PACK OF YOU HE SHOUTED BACK I GUESS THE BURDENS CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU YOU'VE BEEN A SIGHT OF TROUBLE TO THEM ANYHOW
I WANT WE HAVE VERY MUCH CORN THIS FALL WHILE THE HORSES DREW IN THE WATER AND NOSED EACH OTHER AND THEN DRANK AGAIN ANTONIA SAT DOWN ON THE WINDMILL STEP AND RESTED HER HEAD ON HER HAND YOU SEE THE BIG PRAIRIE FIRE FROM YOUR PLACE LAST NIGHT
ALL AFTERNOON WHEREVER ONE WENT IN THE HOUSE ONE COULD HEAR THE PANTING WHEEZE OF THE SAW OR THE PLEASANT PURRING OF THE PLANE THEY WERE SUCH CHEERFUL NOISES SEEMING TO PROMISE NEW THINGS FOR LIVING PEOPLE
WAS FOR A FELLOW IN THE BLACK TIGER MINE UP ABOVE SILVERTON COLORADO
GRANDFATHER ASKED JELINEK WHETHER IN THE OLD COUNTRY THERE WAS SOME SUPERSTITION TO THE EFFECT THAT A SUICIDE MUST BE BURIED AT THE CROSS ROADS
HE WAS A STRAPPING YOUNG FELLOW IN THE EARLY TWENTIES THEN HANDSOME WARM HEARTED AND FULL OF LIFE
OR GOING ALONG THE ROAD WITH HER WORK TEAM SHE WOULD CLAP HER HANDS AND CALL TO US IN A SPITEFUL CROWING VOICE
HE LANDED AMBROSCH A BLOW ON THE HEAD IT SOUNDED LIKE THE CRACK OF AN AXE ON A COW PUMPKIN AMBROSCH DROPPED OVER STUNNED WE HEARD SQUEALS AND LOOKING UP SAW ANTONIA AND HER MOTHER COMING ON THE RUN
AND TOOK MAREK WITH HIM AT FULL WAGES MISSUS SHIMERDA THEN DROVE THE SECOND CULTIVATOR SHE AND ANTONIA WORKED IN THE FIELDS ALL DAY AND DID THE CHORES AT NIGHT WHILE THE TWO WOMEN WERE RUNNING THE PLACE ALONE ONE OF THE NEW HORSES GOT COLIC AND GAVE THEM A TERRIBLE FRIGHT
AND JAKE AND OTTO WERE OFTEN SO TIRED AFTER SUPPER THAT I USED TO FEEL AS IF I WERE SURROUNDED BY A WALL OF SILENCE NOW EVERY ONE SEEMED EAGER TO TALK THAT AFTERNOON FUCHS TOLD ME STORY AFTER STORY ABOUT THE BLACK TIGER MINE
RISING SUDDENLY SINKING SUDDENLY IMPULSIVE AND PLAYFUL LIKE A BIG PUPPY THAT PAWED YOU AND THEN LAY DOWN TO BE PETTED IF I HAD BEEN TOSSED DOWN BLINDFOLD ON THAT RED PRAIRIE I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WAS SPRING EVERYWHERE NOW THERE WAS THE SMELL OF BURNING GRASS
AMBROSCH SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAUNTERED DOWN THE HILL TOWARD THE STABLE I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS ONE OF HIS MEAN DAYS PRESENTLY HE RETURNED CARRYING A COLLAR THAT HAD BEEN BADLY USED TRAMPLED IN THE DIRT AND GNAWED BY RATS UNTIL THE HAIR WAS STICKING OUT OF IT
IT WAS A PITY THAT THOSE FRESHLY PLANED PINE BOARDS WERE TO BE PUT UNDERGROUND SO SOON THE LUMBER WAS HARD TO WORK BECAUSE IT WAS FULL OF FROST AND THE BOARDS GAVE OFF A SWEET SMELL OF PINE WOODS AS THE HEAP OF YELLOW SHAVINGS GREW HIGHER AND HIGHER
AND SHE LET ME SEE THAT SHE ADMIRED HIM WHILE SHE THOUGHT OF ME ONLY AS A LITTLE BOY BEFORE THE SPRING WAS OVER THERE WAS A DISTINCT COLDNESS BETWEEN US AND THE SHIMERDAS IT CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY
WE WAS SNOWED IN THEN LIKE WE ARE NOW AND I HAPPENED TO BE THE ONLY MAN IN CAMP THAT COULD MAKE A COFFIN FOR HIM IT'S A HANDY THING TO KNOW WHEN YOU KNOCK ABOUT LIKE I'VE DONE
SCHOOL IS ALL RIGHT FOR LITTLE BOYS I HELP MAKE THIS LAND ONE GOOD FARM SHE CLUCKED TO HER TEAM AND STARTED FOR THE BARN I WALKED BESIDE HER FEELING VEXED WAS SHE GOING TO GROW UP BOASTFUL LIKE HER MOTHER I WONDERED
MOST MEN WERE GAME AND WENT WITHOUT A GRUDGE THE POSTMASTER GOING HOME STOPPED TO SAY THAT GRANDFATHER WOULD BRING THE CORONER BACK WITH HIM TO SPEND THE NIGHT THE OFFICERS OF THE NORWEGIAN CHURCH HE TOLD US
YOU WON'T FORGET MY FATHER JIM NO I SAID I WILL NEVER FORGET HIM MISSUS SHIMERDA ASKED ME TO STAY FOR SUPPER AFTER AMBROSCH AND ANTONIA HAD WASHED THE FIELD DUST FROM THEIR HANDS AND FACES AT THE WASH BASIN BY THE KITCHEN DOOR
THE NEWS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED OVER THERE HAD SOMEHOW GOT ABROAD THROUGH THE SNOW BLOCKED COUNTRY GRANDMOTHER GAVE THE VISITORS SUGAR CAKES AND HOT COFFEE
AND HE SUCCEEDED IN SELLING THEM TO A NEWLY ARRIVED GERMAN WITH THE MONEY HE BOUGHT ANOTHER TEAM OF HORSES WHICH GRANDFATHER SELECTED FOR HIM MAREK WAS STRONG AND AMBROSCH WORKED HIM HARD BUT HE COULD NEVER TEACH HIM TO CULTIVATE CORN I REMEMBER
AMBROSCH AND ANTONIA ALWAYS GREETED HIM RESPECTFULLY AND HE ASKED THEM ABOUT THEIR AFFAIRS AND GAVE THEM ADVICE AS USUAL HE THOUGHT THE FUTURE LOOKED HOPEFUL FOR THEM AMBROSCH WAS A FAR SEEING FELLOW HE SOON REALIZED THAT HIS OXEN WERE TOO HEAVY FOR ANY WORK EXCEPT BREAKING SOD
HE WAS A MILD FLURRIED OLD MAN A CIVIL WAR VETERAN WITH ONE SLEEVE HANGING EMPTY HE SEEMED TO FIND THIS CASE VERY PERPLEXING AND SAID
IF I LOSE THAT HORSE MISTER BURDEN ANTONIA EXCLAIMED I NEVER STAY HERE TILL AMBROSCH COME HOME I GO DROWN MYSELF IN THE POND BEFORE MORNING
SHE SEEMED TO THINK THAT MY ELDERS WITHHELD HELPFUL INFORMATION AND THAT FROM ME SHE MIGHT GET VALUABLE SECRETS ON THIS OCCASION SHE ASKED ME VERY CRAFTILY WHEN GRANDFATHER EXPECTED TO BEGIN PLANTING CORN
AT DINNER GRANDFATHER TALKED TO JELINEK MORE THAN HE USUALLY DID TO STRANGERS WILL THEY BE MUCH DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE WE CANNOT GET A PRIEST HE ASKED JELINEK LOOKED SERIOUS
THEY DID NOT TAKE THE PATH AROUND THE POND BUT PLUNGED THROUGH THE MUDDY WATER WITHOUT EVEN LIFTING THEIR SKIRTS THEY CAME ON SCREAMING AND CLAWING THE AIR
ANTONIA STOOD UP LIFTING AND DROPPING HER SHOULDERS AS IF THEY WERE STIFF I AIN'T GOT TIME TO LEARN I CAN WORK LIKE MANS NOW MY MOTHER CAN'T SAY NO MORE HOW AMBROSCH DO ALL AND NOBODY TO HELP HIM I CAN WORK AS MUCH AS HIM
AND THE DRY I DID NOT ANSWER HER WHAT WAS THE USE AS I SAT WAITING FOR THE HOUR WHEN AMBROSCH AND ANTONIA WOULD RETURN FROM THE FIELDS I WATCHED MISSUS SHIMERDA AT HER WORK SHE TOOK FROM THE OVEN A COFFEE CAKE WHICH SHE WANTED TO KEEP WARM FOR SUPPER
THERE I WILL BURY HIM IF I DIG THE GRAVE MYSELF SHE SAY I HAVE TO PROMISE HER I HELP AMBROSCH MAKE THE GRAVE TO MORROW GRANDFATHER SMOOTHED HIS BEARD AND LOOKED JUDICIAL
DON'T BE MAD I KNOW IT'S AWFUL HARD WORK FOR BREAK SOD I MILK THE COW FOR YOU TO MORROW IF YOU WANT MISSUS SHIMERDA TURNED QUICKLY TO ME THAT COW NOT GIVE SO MUCH MILK LIKE WHAT YOUR GRANDPA SAY
THE SHIMERDAS WERE IN THEIR NEW LOG HOUSE BY THEN THE NEIGHBORS HAD HELPED THEM TO BUILD IT IN MARCH IT STOOD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEIR OLD CAVE WHICH THEY USED AS A CELLAR THE FAMILY WERE NOW FAIRLY EQUIPPED TO BEGIN THEIR STRUGGLE WITH THE SOIL
WE RODE AWAY FEELING SO OUTRAGED THAT THE FINE MORNING WAS SPOILED FOR US I HAD N'T A WORD TO SAY AND POOR JAKE WAS WHITE AS PAPER AND TREMBLING ALL OVER IT MADE HIM SICK TO GET SO ANGRY
SOMETIME YOU WILL TELL ME ALL THOSE NICE THINGS YOU LEARN AT THE SCHOOL WON'T YOU JIMMY SHE ASKED WITH A SUDDEN RUSH OF FEELING IN HER VOICE MY FATHER HE WENT MUCH TO SCHOOL
OUR NEIGHBORS BURNED OFF THEIR PASTURE BEFORE THE NEW GRASS MADE A START SO THAT THE FRESH GROWTH WOULD NOT BE MIXED WITH THE DEAD STAND OF LAST YEAR THOSE LIGHT SWIFT FIRES RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SEEMED A PART OF THE SAME KINDLING THAT WAS IN THE AIR
I'LL GET RIGHT AFTER JOSIAH TO START ONE IN THE SPRING IF ANYTHING WAS TO HAPPEN TO ME I DON'T WANT THE NORWEGIANS HOLDING INQUISITIONS OVER ME TO SEE WHETHER I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO BE LAID AMONGST EM SOON GRANDFATHER RETURNED BRINGING WITH HIM ANTON JELINEK AND THAT IMPORTANT PERSON THE CORONER
THE WAY HE ACTED AND THE WAY HIS AXE FIT THE WOUND WAS ENOUGH TO CONVICT ANY MAN
I TIED MY PONY AND WENT INTO THE KITCHEN WHERE MISSUS SHIMERDA WAS BAKING BREAD CHEWING POPPY SEEDS AS SHE WORKED BY THIS TIME SHE COULD SPEAK ENOUGH ENGLISH TO ASK ME A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT OUR MEN WERE DOING IN THE FIELDS
AND WRAPPED IT IN A QUILT STUFFED WITH FEATHERS I HAVE SEEN HER PUT EVEN A ROAST GOOSE IN THIS QUILT TO KEEP IT HOT WHEN THE NEIGHBORS WERE THERE BUILDING THE NEW HOUSE THEY SAW HER DO THIS AND THE STORY GOT ABROAD THAT THE SHIMERDAS KEPT THEIR FOOD IN THEIR FEATHER BEDS
O NIGHTS WI TWENTY GALLONS O MILK ON MY MIND AND DINGALL ULL TAKE NO MORE BUTTER LET ALONE PAYING FOR IT
AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET IS HE COME BACK SAID ADAM AT LAST NO HE IS NOT SAID MISTER IRWINE QUIETLY LAY DOWN YOUR HAT ADAM UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A LITTLE FRESH AIR
NOT BUT WHAT I'M GLAD TO HEAR O ANYBODY RESPECTABLE COMING INTO THE PARISH THERE'S SOME
THERE'S PLENTY O THINGS MAY HAPPEN BETWEEN THIS AND MICHAELMAS TWELVEMONTH THE CAPTAIN MAY BE MASTER AFORE THEM FOR WHAT WE KNOW SAID MISSUS POYSER INCLINED TO TAKE AN UNUSUALLY HOPEFUL VIEW OF AN EMBARRASSMENT WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY HER OWN MERIT
AND KNOWS ALL THE WHILE THE PUNISHMENT LL FALL ON SOMEBODY ELSE THERE AGAIN YOU PARTLY DECEIVE YOURSELF ADAM THERE IS NO SORT OF WRONG DEED OF WHICH A MAN CAN BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU CAN'T ISOLATE YOURSELF
IT WAS AS IF YOU WAS A INSECT AND HE WAS GOING TO DAB HIS FINGER NAIL ON YOU HOWEVER SHE SAID YOUR SERVANT SIR AND CURTSIED WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT DEFERENCE AS SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM SHE WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO MISBEHAVE TOWARDS HER BETTERS
BUT THEN THAT'S THE DEEPEST CURSE OF ALL THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BLACKNESS OF IT IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE MY POOR HETTY SHE CAN NEVER BE MY SWEET HETTY AGAIN THE PRETTIEST THING GOD HAD MADE
SAID BARTLE MASSEY RISING HASTILY AND UNFASTENING THE DOOR IT WAS MISTER IRWINE ADAM ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WITH INSTINCTIVE RESPECT AS MISTER IRWINE APPROACHED HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND I'M LATE ADAM
SMILING UP AT ME I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME AND WAS GOOD ADAM'S VOICE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY SINKING INTO A HOARSE UNDERTONE AS IF HE WERE ONLY TALKING TO HIMSELF BUT NOW HE SAID ABRUPTLY LOOKING AT MISTER IRWINE
I WANT HIM TO FEEL WHAT SHE FEELS IT'S HIS WORK SHE WAS A CHILD AS IT UD HA GONE T ANYBODY'S HEART TO LOOK AT I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE'S DONE IT WAS HIM BROUGHT HER TO IT AND HE SHALL KNOW IT HE SHALL FEEL IT
BUT PERHAPS THE POYSERS
NOT HALF SO HATEFUL AS THAT LET A MAN DO WHAT HE WILL IF HE KNOWS HE'S TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT HIMSELF
HE PROFFERED VARIOUS CORROBORATING CIRCUMSTANCES I SEE HIM MYSELF HE SAID I SEE HIM COMING ALONG BY THE CRAB TREE MEADOW ON A BALD FACED HOSS I'D JUST BEEN T HEV A PINT
WAS BEGINNING A MILD REMONSTRANCE EXPLANATORY OF THE INCONVENIENCE HE SHOULD FIND IN HAVING TO BUY AND SELL MORE STOCK WITH
AND WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE CAUSEWAY WHEN HIS MASTER BECKONED YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR AND YOU MAY GO SPINNIN UNDERHAND WAYS O DOING US A MISCHIEF FOR YOU'VE GOT OLD HARRY TO YOUR FRIEND THOUGH NOBODY ELSE IS
THOUGH THERE'S SOME ON IT AS ONE'S NO NEED TO SEE THE SMELL'S ENOUGH
HELD IT FIRMLY BETWEEN HER CLASPED HANDS SAY WHY I SAY YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE
AND NOT BY OTHER PEOPLE'S FAULT I'M NONE FOR WORRETING SAID MISTER POYSER RISING FROM HIS THREE CORNERED CHAIR AND WALKING SLOWLY TOWARDS THE DOOR
THE NEGLECTED BEARD OF A MAN JUST RISEN FROM A SICK BED HIS HEAVY BLACK HAIR HANGS OVER HIS FOREHEAD AND THERE IS NO ACTIVE IMPULSE IN HIM WHICH INCLINES HIM TO PUSH IT OFF THAT HE MAY BE MORE AWAKE TO WHAT IS AROUND HIM
WI INS AN OUTS TO FIT INT EVERYTHING ELSE IF YOU COULD MAKE A PUDDING WI THINKING O THE BATTER IT UD BE EASY GETTING DINNER
AND FLY IN THE FACE OF THE CATECHISM WITHOUT SEVERE PROVOCATION IS YOUR HUSBAND AT HOME MISSUS POYSER YES SIR HE'S ONLY THE RICK YARD I'LL SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE IF YOU'LL PLEASE TO GET DOWN AND STEP IN
AND LOSE HALF OF EM WI THE MEASLES AND THERE'S THE FETCHING AND CARRYING AS UD BE WELLY HALF A DAY'S WORK FOR A MAN AN HOSS THAT'S TO BE TOOK OUT O THE PROFITS I RECKON BUT THERE'S FOLKS UD HOLD A SIEVE UNDER THE PUMP
AND THAT FRESH HEARER WAS MARTIN POYSER WHO AS HIS WIFE SAID
HE HAS ONE ARM OVER THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AND HE SEEMS TO BE LOOKING DOWN AT HIS CLASPED HANDS HE IS ROUSED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
I SHOULD THINK A MAN AS HAS LIVED AMONG THE GENTRY FROM A BY
I FEAR YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OUT AGAIN TO DAY YOU NEEDN'T DECEIVE ME SIR SAID ADAM LOOKING HARD AT MISTER IRWINE AND SPEAKING IN A TONE OF ANGRY SUSPICION YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF ME I ONLY WANT JUSTICE
AND KEEPING EM WITH THEIR HANDS ON THEIR HIPS LISTENING TO ALL MANNER O GOSSIP WHEN THEY SHOULD BE DOWN ON THEIR KNEES A SCOURING IF WE'RE TO GO TO RUIN IT SHANNA BE WI HAVING OUR BACK KITCHEN TURNED INTO A PUBLIC WELL POYSER
THERE ARE OCCASIONS ON WHICH TWO SERVANT GIRLS AND A WAGGONER MAY BE A FORMIDABLE AUDIENCE AND AS THE SQUIRE RODE AWAY ON HIS BLACK PONY EVEN THE GIFT OF SHORT SIGHTEDNESS DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM BEING AWARE THAT MOLLY
AND THEN STAND BY AND SEE EM PUNISH HER WHILE THEY LET ME ALONE AND ALL FOR A BIT O PLEASURE AS IF HE'D HAD A MAN'S HEART IN HIM HE'D HA CUT HIS HAND OFF SOONER THAN HE'D HA TAKEN IT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T FORESEE WHAT'S HAPPENED
AND IF THE MEETING HAD NO GOOD EFFECT ON HER IT WOULD BE PURE USELESS SUFFERING TO YOU SEVERE SUFFERING I FEAR SHE IS VERY MUCH CHANGED ADAM STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR
AND YOU KEEP IT SO EXQUISITELY CLEAN MISSUS POYSER I LIKE THESE PREMISES DO YOU KNOW BEYOND ANY ON THE ESTATE WELL SIR SINCE YOU'RE FOND OF EM
SAID MISTER POYSER WITH A GOOD NATURED BLANKNESS OF IMAGINATION AS TO THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT IF I'M CALLED UPON TO SPEAK SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER AFTER GLANCING AT HER HUSBAND WITH PITY AT HIS SOFTNESS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ME
SAID MISSUS POYSER AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN BOWED LOW IN ANSWER TO HETTY'S CURTSY WHILE TOTTY CONSCIOUS OF A PINAFORE STAINED WITH GOOSEBERRY JAM STOOD HIDING HER FACE AGAINST THE CLOCK AND PEEPING ROUND FURTIVELY
HE MAY BE WEAK BUT HE IS NOT CALLOUS NOT COLDLY SELFISH I AM PERSUADED
THANK YOU I WILL DO SO I WANT TO CONSULT HIM ABOUT A LITTLE MATTER BUT YOU ARE QUITE AS MUCH CONCERNED IN IT IF NOT MORE I MUST HAVE YOUR OPINION TOO HETTY RUN AND TELL YOUR UNCLE TO COME IN
I THINK FOLKS HAVE TO WAIT LONG ENOUGH AFORE IT'S BROUGHT TO EM THE FACT IS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE IGNORING MISSUS POYSER'S THEORY OF WORLDLY PROSPERITY
THAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE FETCHING AND CARRYING YOU WILL NOT HAVE MISSUS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE WHO THOUGHT THAT THIS ENTRANCE INTO PARTICULARS INDICATED A DISTANT INCLINATION TO COMPROMISE ON MISSUS POYSER'S PART
YES ADAM I AND THE CHAPLAIN HAVE BOTH BEEN WITH HER THIS EVENING DID YOU ASK HER SIR DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME YES SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH SOME HESITATION
ADDED TO THOSE WE ARE SUFFERING UNDER YOU COULD NOT BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU WOULD ENTAIL THE WORST SORROWS ON EVERY ONE WHO LOVES YOU YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF BLIND FURY THAT WOULD LEAVE ALL THE PRESENT EVILS JUST AS THEY WERE
POYSER MIGHT SIT DOWN IF HE LIKED SHE THOUGHT SHE WASN'T GOING TO SIT DOWN AS IF SHE'D GIVE IN TO ANY SUCH SMOOTH TONGUED PALAVER MISTER POYSER WHO LOOKED AND FELT THE REVERSE OF ICY DID SIT DOWN IN HIS THREE CORNERED CHAIR
I FEEL THE TERRIBLE EXTENT OF SUFFERING THIS SIN OF ARTHUR'S HAS CAUSED TO OTHERS BUT SO DOES EVERY SIN CAUSE SUFFERING TO OTHERS BESIDES THOSE WHO COMMIT IT AN ACT OF VENGEANCE ON YOUR PART AGAINST ARTHUR WOULD SIMPLY BE ANOTHER EVIL
HE WOULD RATHER GIVE UP THAN HAVE A QUARREL ANY DAY AND AFTER ALL IT MATTERED MORE TO HIS WIFE THAN TO HIM SO AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE HE LOOKED UP AT HER AND SAID MILDLY WHAT DOST SAY
I SAYS FOR I WANTED TO HEAR THE TURN OF HIS TONGUE AS I MIGHT KNOW WHETHER HE WAS A THIS COUNTRY MAN SO I SAYS GOOD MORNING SIR IT LL OLD HUP FOR THE BARLEY THIS MORNING I THINK THERE'LL BE A BIT GOT HIN IF WE'VE GOOD LUCK
ON ALL HANDS ABOUT YOUR FINE CHEESE AND BUTTER SAID THE SQUIRE LOOKING POLITELY UNCONSCIOUS THAT THERE COULD BE ANY QUESTION ON WHICH HE AND MISSUS POYSER MIGHT HAPPEN TO DISAGREE I THINK I SEE THE DOOR OPEN THERE
AND NOW POYSER AS SATCHELL IS LAID UP I AM INTENDING TO LET THE CHASE FARM TO A RESPECTABLE TENANT I'M TIRED OF HAVING A FARM ON MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IS MADE THE BEST OF IN SUCH CASES AS YOU KNOW
IF THEY NOW URGE YOU STRONGLY TO GO AND SEE HER TO MORROW MORNING EVEN WITHOUT HER CONSENT
AND THE GANDER HISSING AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE PONY'S HEELS CARRIED OUT THE IDEA OF MISSUS POYSER'S SOLO IN AN IMPRESSIVE QUARTET MISSUS POYSER HOWEVER HAD NO SOONER SEEN THE PONY MOVE OFF THAN SHE TURNED ROUND
SHE ALWAYS CITED IT AFTERWARDS AS A CASE OF PREVISION WHICH REALLY HAD SOMETHING MORE IN IT THAN HER OWN REMARKABLE PENETRATION THAT THE MOMENT SHE SET EYES ON THE SQUIRE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I SHOULDNA WONDER IF HE'S COME ABOUT THAT MAN
AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT SEE THAT TO FIX YOUR MIND ON ARTHUR'S PUNISHMENT IS REVENGE AND NOT JUSTICE YOU ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LED ON TO THE COMMISSION OF SOME GREAT WRONG REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
EVEN IN DETERMINING WHO HAS COMMITTED A SINGLE CRIMINAL ACT AND THE PROBLEM
IN THESE CASES WE SOMETIMES FORM OUR JUDGMENT ON WHAT SEEMS TO US STRONG EVIDENCE AND YET FOR WANT OF KNOWING SOME SMALL FACT OUR JUDGMENT IS WRONG BUT SUPPOSE THE WORST YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY
SINCE THEY WON'T COME NIGH HER THEMSELVES BUT I THINK SHE WOULD FOR THE METHODISTS ARE GREAT FOLKS FOR GOING INTO THE PRISONS AND SETH SAID HE THOUGHT SHE WOULD SHE'D A VERY TENDER WAY WITH HER DINAH HAD
BLOOD ULL BEAR IT BUT I'LL NOT MAKE A MARTYR O MYSELF AND WEAR MYSELF TO SKIN AND BONE AND WORRET MYSELF AS IF I WAS A CHURN WI BUTTER A COMING IN'T FOR NO LANDLORD IN ENGLAND NOT IF HE WAS KING GEORGE HIMSELF
THIS MICHAELMAS TWELVEMONTH SAID MISTER POYSER AND GOING INTO A STRANGE PARISH WHERE THEE KNOW'ST NOBODY IT'LL BE HARD UPON US BOTH
WITH TWO BEDS IN IT ONE LAID ON THE FLOOR IT IS TEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE DARK WALL OPPOSITE THE WINDOW SHUTS OUT THE MOONLIGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DIP CANDLE BY WHICH BARTLE MASSEY IS PRETENDING TO READ
IF YOU'LL GET A STRANGER TO LEAD SUCH A LIFE HERE AS THAT A MAGGOT MUST BE BORN THE ROTTEN CHEESE TO LIKE IT I RECKON YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR CONTINUED MISSUS POYSER FOLLOWING THE OLD SQUIRE BEYOND THE DOOR
ALL HIS LIFE WHY DO YOU CRAVE VENGEANCE IN THIS WAY NO AMOUNT OF TORTURE THAT YOU COULD INFLICT ON HIM COULD BENEFIT HER NO O GOD NO ADAM GROANED OUT SINKING ON HIS CHAIR AGAIN
THE SPEECHES HAD ALWAYS REMAINED IMAGINARY GOOD DAY MISSUS POYSER SAID THE OLD SQUIRE PEERING AT HER WITH HIS SHORT SIGHTED EYES A MODE OF LOOKING AT HER WHICH AS MISSUS POYSER OBSERVED ALLAYS AGGRAVATED ME
HE WILL KNOW HE WILL SUFFER LONG AND BITTERLY HE HAS A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE I CAN'T BE ENTIRELY DECEIVED IN HIS CHARACTER I AM CONVINCED
HE FORESAW ENOUGH HE'D NO RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT HARM AND SHAME TO HER
I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU'D LET A BIT O REPAIRS BE DONE TO EM FOR THE BOARDING'S THAT STATE AS WE'RE LIKE TO BE EATEN UP WI RATS AND MICE AND THE CELLAR YOU MAY STAN UP TO YOUR KNEES WATER IN'T IF YOU LIKE TO GO DOWN BUT PERHAPS YOU'D RATHER BELIEVE MY WORDS
BETHELL WILL DO THAT REGULARLY WITH THE CART AND PONY OH SIR BEGGING YOUR PARDON I'VE NEVER BEEN USED T HAVING GENTLEFOLKS'S SERVANTS COMING ABOUT MY BACK PLACES A MAKING LOVE TO BOTH THE GELLS AT ONCE
I THINK SHE HAS NOT A GOOD METHOD AS YOU HAVE INDEED SIR I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SAID MISSUS POYSER IN A HARD VOICE ROLLING AND UNROLLING HER KNITTING AND LOOKING ICILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS SHE CONTINUED TO STAND OPPOSITE THE SQUIRE
FOR WANT O KNOWING HOW T UNDO THE TACKLE
IT IS NOT ONLY YOU SOME FATAL INFLUENCE SEEMS TO HAVE SHUT UP HER HEART AGAINST HER FELLOW CREATURES SHE HAS SCARCELY SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN NO EITHER TO ME OR THE CHAPLAIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO BEFORE YOU WERE MENTIONED TO HER
MISTER POYSER HAD JUST ENTERED IN SHIRT SLEEVES AND OPEN WAISTCOAT WITH A FACE A SHADE REDDER THAN USUAL FROM THE EXERTION OF PITCHING AS HE STOOD RED ROTUND AND RADIANT
NOT YET I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY
WI THE CELLAR FULL O WATER AND FROGS AND TOADS HOPPIN UP THE STEPS BY DOZENS AND THE FLOORS ROTTEN AND THE RATS AND MICE GNAWING EVERY BIT O CHEESE AND RUNNIN OVER OUR HEADS AS WE LIE BED TILL WE EXPECT EM TO EAT US UP ALIVE
AS IS A GOING TO TAKE THE CHASE FARM WANTING POYSER TO DO SOMETHING FOR HIM WITHOUT PAY BUT POYSER'S A FOOL IF HE DOES
THE NEXT SATURDAY EVENING THERE WAS MUCH EXCITED DISCUSSION AT THE DONNITHORNE ARMS CONCERNING AN INCIDENT WHICH HAD OCCURRED THAT VERY DAY NO LESS THAN A SECOND APPEARANCE OF THE SMART MAN IN TOP BOOTS
AND JUST AS I COME UP BY THE BIG ASH TREE I SEE THE MAN TOP BOOTS COMING ALONG ON A BALD FACED HOSS I WISH I MAY NEVER STIR IF I DIDN'T AND I STOOD STILL TILL HE COME UP AND I SAYS GOOD MORNING SIR
THERE'S NO PLEASURE LIVING IF YOU'RE TO BE CORKED UP FOR EVER AND ONLY DRIBBLE YOUR MIND OUT BY THE SLY LIKE A LEAKY BARREL I SHAN'T REPENT SAYING WHAT I THINK
I KNOW THERE'S THEM AS IS BORN T OWN THE LAND AND THEM AS IS BORN TO SWEAT ON'T HERE MISSUS POYSER PAUSED TO GASP A LITTLE AND I KNOW IT'S CHRISTENED FOLKS'S DUTY TO SUBMIT TO THEIR BETTERS AS FUR AS FLESH AND
GAVE THE TWO HILARIOUS DAMSELS A LOOK WHICH DROVE THEM INTO THE BACK KITCHEN AND UNSPEARING HER KNITTING BEGAN TO KNIT AGAIN WITH HER USUAL RAPIDITY AS SHE RE ENTERED THE HOUSE THEE'ST DONE IT NOW SAID MISTER POYSER
THE REST OF THE PARTY BEING LOAMSNIRE MEN
HE WAS MUCH TOO ACUTE A MAN NOT TO SEE THROUGH THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND TO FORESEE PERFECTLY WHAT WOULD BE HIS WIFE'S VIEW OF THE SUBJECT BUT HE DISLIKED GIVING UNPLEASANT ANSWERS UNLESS IT WAS ON A POINT OF FARMING PRACTICE
TILL A PLACE TUMBLES DOWN AND NOT THEN ON'Y WI BEGGING AND PRAYING AND HAVING TO PAY HALF AND BEING STRUNG UP WI THE RENT AS IT'S MUCH IF HE GETS ENOUGH OUT O THE LAND TO PAY FOR ALL HE'S PUT HIS OWN MONEY INTO THE GROUND BEFOREHAND SEE
IT SEEMS THEY HAD NO EXACT ADDRESS ADAM SAT RUMINATING A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID
YOU'RE ABOUT AS NEAR THE RIGHT LANGUAGE AS A PIG'S SQUEAKING IS LIKE A TUNE PLAYED ON A KEY BUGLE WELL I DON'T KNOW
FOR YOUR NAME'S NO BETTER THAN A BRIMSTONE MATCH IN EVERYBODY'S NOSE IF IT ISNA TWO THREE OLD FOLKS AS YOU THINK O SAVING YOUR SOUL BY GIVING EM A BIT O FLANNEL AND A DROP O PORRIDGE AN YOU MAY BE RIGHT THINKING IT'LL TAKE BUT LITTLE TO SAVE YOUR SOUL
BUT KEEPING NEAR THE DOOR I'M SURE I SHOULD LIKE MY BREAKFAST BETTER IF I KNEW THE BUTTER AND CREAM CAME FROM THIS DAIRY THANK YOU THAT REALLY IS A PLEASANT SIGHT UNFORTUNATELY MY SLIGHT TENDENCY TO RHEUMATISM MAKES ME AFRAID OF DAMP
LET US ALL SIT DOWN ADAM TOOK HIS CHAIR AGAIN MECHANICALLY AND BARTLE FOR WHOM THERE WAS NO CHAIR REMAINING SAT ON THE BED IN THE BACKGROUND HAVE YOU SEEN HER SIR
FOR THE OLD SQUIRE'S VISITS TO HIS TENANTRY WERE RARE AND THOUGH MISSUS POYSER HAD DURING THE LAST TWELVEMONTH RECITED MANY IMAGINARY SPEECHES MEANING EVEN MORE THAN MET THE EAR
THAT THE INTERVIEW MIGHT AFFECT HER FAVOURABLY BUT I GRIEVE TO SAY I HAVE SCARCELY ANY HOPE OF THAT SHE DIDN'T SEEM AGITATED WHEN I MENTIONED YOUR NAME SHE ONLY SAID NO IN THE SAME COLD OBSTINATE WAY AS USUAL
SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEATING HIMSELF ON A SMALL CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR DO YOU KNOW MISSUS POYSER SIT DOWN PRAY BOTH OF YOU I'VE BEEN FAR FROM CONTENTED FOR SOME TIME WITH MISSUS SATCHELL'S DAIRY MANAGEMENT
WHEN I ASKED HER IF THERE WAS ANY ONE OF HER FAMILY WHOM SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO WHOM SHE COULD OPEN HER MIND SHE SAID WITH A VIOLENT SHUDDER TELL THEM NOT TO COME NEAR ME I WON'T SEE ANY OF THEM
YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED IF I CAST A COVETOUS EYE ON YOUR CREAM AND BUTTER I DON'T EXPECT THAT MISSUS SATCHELL'S CREAM AND BUTTER WILL BEAR COMPARISON WITH YOURS I CAN'T SAY SIR I'M SURE IT'S SELDOM I SEE OTHER FOLKS'S BUTTER
FOR IT IS PASSION AND YOU DECEIVE YOURSELF IN CALLING IT JUSTICE IT MIGHT BE WITH YOU PRECISELY AS IT HAS BEEN WITH ARTHUR NAY WORSE YOUR PASSION MIGHT LEAD YOU YOURSELF INTO A HORRIBLE CRIME
TO SIN AND MISERY I'M NOT DECEIVING YOU ADAM SAID MISTER IRWINE ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IS NOT COME BACK WAS NOT COME BACK WHEN I LEFT I HAVE LEFT A LETTER FOR HIM HE WILL KNOW
AND WISELY FELL BACK ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED IN A SINGLE EVENING WAS RENEWED IN THE CHURCHYARD BEFORE SERVICE THE NEXT DAY WITH THE FRESH INTEREST CONFERRED ON ALL NEWS WHEN THERE IS A FRESH PERSON TO HEAR IT
I'LL SIT DOWN IN YOUR COMFORTABLE KITCHEN AH POYSER HOW DO YOU DO IN THE MIDST OF BUSINESS I SEE AS USUAL I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT YOUR WIFE'S BEAUTIFUL DAIRY
AND I SHALL NOT FORGET YOUR READINESS TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR LANDLORD AS WELL AS A NEIGHBOUR I KNOW YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOUR LEASE RENEWED FOR THREE YEARS WHEN THE PRESENT ONE EXPIRES OTHERWISE I DARESAY THURLE WHO IS A MAN OF SOME CAPITAL
IS DINAH MORRIS COME TO EM SIR SETH SAID THEY'D SENT FOR HER NO MISTER POYSER TELLS ME SHE WAS NOT COME WHEN HE LEFT THEY'RE AFRAID THE LETTER HAS NOT REACHED HER
IF I'D THOUGHT OF IT EARLIER I WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME MEASURES FOR FINDING HER OUT SAID MISTER IRWINE BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW I FEAR WELL ADAM I MUST GO NOW TRY TO GET SOME REST TO NIGHT
YOU HAVE A MIND THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THIS FULLY ADAM WHEN YOU ARE CALM DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN'T ENTER INTO THE ANGUISH THAT DRIVES YOU INTO THIS STATE OF REVENGEFUL HATRED BUT
MISSUS POYSER HAD HAD HER EYES FIXED ON HER HUSBAND WITH COLD SEVERITY DURING HIS SILENCE BUT NOW SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD WITH A TOSS LOOKED ICILY AT THE OPPOSITE ROOF OF THE COW SHED AND SPEARING HER KNITTING TOGETHER WITH THE LOOSE PIN
WHILE HE SPOKE TO BARTLE MASSEY ABOUT OLD MISTER DONNITHORNE'S FUNERAL AND OTHER MATTERS OF AN INDIFFERENT KIND BUT AT LENGTH ADAM TURNED ROUND AND SAID IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE
THAT THE GUILT OF HER CRIME LIES WITH HIM AND THAT HE OUGHT TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT IT IS NOT FOR US MEN TO APPORTION THE SHARES OF MORAL GUILT AND RETRIBUTION WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID MISTAKES
AND THERE'S LITTLE LIKELIHOOD FOR IT SEEMS AS IF THEM AS AREN'T WANTED HERE ARE TH
SIGN HER SOUL AWAY I'VE A RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR I MAKE ONE QUARTER O THE RENT AND SAVE ANOTHER QUARTER
A LITTLE ALARMED AND UNEASY BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME TRIUMPHANT AMUSEMENT AT HIS WIFE'S OUTBREAK YES I KNOW I'VE DONE IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
WHAT'S TO MAKE ME SURE AS THE HOUSE WON'T BE PUT O BOARD WAGE AFORE WE'RE MANY MONTHS OLDER AND THEN
THAN CORN LAND MISTER POYSER WAS LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIS MOUTH SCREWED UP
THAT IT WAS NOT IN THIS CASE A PURELY ABSTRACT QUESTION I DARESAY SAID MISSUS POYSER BITTERLY TURNING HER HEAD HALF WAY TOWARDS HER HUSBAND AND LOOKING AT THE VACANT ARM CHAIR I DARESAY IT'S TRUE FOR MEN
AND SEIZED HIS HAT WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE BUT HE STOOD STILL THEN AND LOOKED AT MISTER IRWINE AS IF HE HAD A QUESTION TO ASK WHICH IT WAS YET DIFFICULT TO UTTER BARTLE MASSEY ROSE QUIETLY TURNED THE KEY IN THE DOOR
WHEN MISSUS POYSER BURST IN WITH THE DESPERATE DETERMINATION TO HAVE HER SAY OUT THIS ONCE THOUGH IT WERE TO RAIN NOTICES TO QUIT AND THE ONLY SHELTER WERE THE WORK HOUSE THEN SIR IF I MAY SPEAK AS
NO NOT WORSE SAID ADAM BITTERLY I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WORSE I'D SOONER DO IT I'D SOONER DO A WICKEDNESS AS I COULD SUFFER FOR BY MYSELF THAN HA BROUGHT HER TO DO WICKEDNESS
YOU NEVER SAW HER SIR DID YOU YES I DID I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HER SHE PLEASED ME A GOOD DEAL AND NOW YOU MENTION IT I WISH SHE WOULD COME FOR IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A GENTLE MILD WOMAN LIKE HER
AYE AYE MAN SAID BARTLE WITH A TONE OF SARCASTIC CONSOLATION YOU TALK THE RIGHT LANGUAGE FOR YOU WHEN MIKE HOLDSWORTH'S GOAT SAYS BA A A IT'S ALL RIGHT IT UD BE UNNATURAL FOR IT TO MAKE ANY OTHER NOISE
YOU'RE LIKELY TO FIND MISTER THURLE AN EXCELLENT NEIGHBOUR I ASSURE YOU SUCH A ONE AS YOU WILL FEEL GLAD TO HAVE ACCOMMODATED BY THE LITTLE PLAN I'M GOING TO MENTION ESPECIALLY AS I HOPE YOU WILL FIND IT AS MUCH TO YOUR OWN ADVANTAGE AS HIS
AFTER YOU HAD GIVEN THAT BLOW TO ARTHUR IN THE GROVE ADAM WAS SILENT THE LAST WORDS HAD CALLED UP A VIVID IMAGE OF THE PAST AND MISTER IRWINE LEFT HIM TO HIS THOUGHTS
AS IT'S A MERCY THEY HANNA EAT THE CHILDREN LONG AGO
FOR AFTER THE FIRST MOMENTS OF STUNNED SURPRISE HE HAD GOT UP AND WAVING HIS HAND TOWARDS HER WITH A SMILE HAD WALKED OUT TOWARDS HIS PONY BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GET AWAY IMMEDIATELY FOR JOHN WAS WALKING THE PONY UP AND DOWN THE YARD
WHAT A FINE OLD KITCHEN THIS IS SAID MISTER DONNITHORNE LOOKING ROUND ADMIRINGLY HE ALWAYS SPOKE IN THE SAME DELIBERATE WELL CHISELLED POLITE WAY WHETHER HIS WORDS WERE SUGARY OR VENOMOUS
NO NO MY DEAR MISSUS POYSER CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE SQUIRE STILL CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN POWERS OF PERSUASION YOU MUST NOT OVERWORK YOURSELF
EVEN WITHOUT THE FINAL THREAT HER HUSBAND REALLY ALARMED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR LEAVING THE OLD PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN BRED AND BORN FOR HE BELIEVED THE OLD SQUIRE HAD SMALL SPITE ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING
AS SPEAKS MY MIND THERE'S PLENTY O THE SAME WAY O THINKING THIS PARISH
BUT SHE ISN'T AS GUILTY AS THEY SAY YOU DON'T THINK SHE IS SIR SHE CAN'T HA DONE IT THAT PERHAPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY ADAM MISTER IRWINE ANSWERED GENTLY
BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOUR WORK WILL RATHER BE LESSENED THAN INCREASED IN THIS WAY THERE IS SO MUCH MILK REQUIRED AT THE ABBEY THAT YOU WILL HAVE LITTLE INCREASE OF CHEESE AND BUTTER MAKING FROM THE ADDITION TO YOUR DAIRY
NOW THE PLAN I'M THINKING OF IS TO EFFECT A LITTLE EXCHANGE IF YOU WERE TO HAVE THE HOLLOW PASTURES YOU MIGHT INCREASE YOUR DAIRY WHICH MUST BE SO PROFITABLE UNDER YOUR WIFE'S MANAGEMENT AND I SHOULD REQUEST YOU MISSUS POYSER
INDEED SIR IF IT'S ANYTHING T OUR ADVANTAGE
THE PERSONAL WITNESS TO THE STRANGER'S VISIT PRONOUNCED CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO BE NOTHING BETTER THAN A BAILIFF SUCH AS SATCHELL HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM NO ONE HAD THOUGHT OF DENYING MISTER CASSON'S TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD SEEN THE STRANGER NEVERTHELESS
AS HE STEPPED OUT ON THE PATH HE HEARD VOICES AND PRESENTLY SOME DOZEN MEN ONE OF WHOM HELD A HORSE BURST OUT UPON HIM AND WITH SUDDEN FURY SEIZED AND FLUNG HIM TO THE GROUND
FAREWELL MY OWN MOTHER NOT YET NOT YET AH SEE HE HAS TAKEN THE BELSIZE ROAD OH RICHARD PRAY HEAVEN THEY MAY NOT MEET TUSH THEY WILL NOT MEET YOU ARE PALE YOU FAINT
AND THE BRASS PLATE OF THE COMPASS CASE SPARKLED IN THE SUN LIKE A JEWEL
SHE WAS A DELICATE LOOKING CHILD OF SIX YEARS OLD WITH BLUE EYES AND BRIGHT HAIR THOUGH INDULGED BY HER FATHER AND SPOILED BY HER MOTHER THE NATURAL SWEETNESS OF HER DISPOSITION SAVED HER FROM BEING DISAGREEABLE
BUT HE SAW THE READY BAYONET OF THE SENTRY GLEAM AND HE CHECKED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT FOR HIS ASSAILANT WAS MISTER MAURICE FRERE WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU DO HERE ASKED THE GENTLEMAN WITH AN OATH YOU LAZY SKULKING HOUND WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE
IT WAS HE WHO NEGOTIATED WITH MARY STUART FOR ELIZABETH IT WAS HE WHO WORMED OUT OF COBHAM THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE GREAT RALEIGH HE BECAME RICH AND HIS SISTER THE WIDOW OF HENRY DE KIRKHAVEN LORD OF HEMFLEET MARRYING INTO THE FAMILY OF THE WOTTONS
WHICH EXHALED A HEAVY AND INTOXICATING PERFUME FOR AN INSTANT THE TWO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THEN RUFUS DAWES WAS SEIZED FROM BEHIND BY HIS COLLAR AND FLUNG WITH A SHOCK UPON THE DECK LEAPING TO HIS FEET HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO RUSH UPON HIS ASSAILANT
THE LOW BROWED COARSE FEATURED RUFFIANS GROUPED ABOUT THE DECK CAST MANY A LEER OF CONTEMPT AT THE SOLITARY FIGURE BUT THEIR REMARKS WERE CONFINED TO GESTURES ONLY THERE ARE DEGREES IN CRIME AND RUFUS DAWES THE CONVICTED FELON
THE FATHER AND SON APPROACHED EACH OTHER AS THE YOUNG MAN GAINED THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH WHICH LED TO THE HEATH HE MET SIR RICHARD RETURNING FROM THE VILLAGE
TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HOWEVER SIR RICHARD PASSED SWIFTLY ON WITH BODY BENT FORWARD AS ONE IN THE ACT OF FALLING AND WITH EYES UNCONSCIOUS OF SURROUNDINGS STARING STRAIGHT INTO THE DISTANCE HALF TERRIFIED AT THIS STRANGE APPEARANCE RICHARD HURRIED ONWARD
HIS COMPANIONS SITTING ON THE COMBINGS OF THE MAIN HATCH OR CROUCHED IN CARELESS FASHION ON THE SHADY SIDE OF THE BARRICADE WERE LAUGHING AND TALKING WITH BLASPHEMOUS AND OBSCENE MERRIMENT HIDEOUS TO CONTEMPLATE
AND THE EFFECTS OF HER EDUCATION AS YET ONLY SHOWED THEMSELVES IN A THOUSAND IMPERIOUS PRETTINESSES WHICH MADE HER THE DARLING OF THE SHIP LITTLE MISS SYLVIA WAS PRIVILEGED TO GO ANYWHERE AND DO ANYTHING AND EVEN CONVICTISM SHUT ITS FOUL MOUTH IN HER PRESENCE
THESE DREADFUL CALMS THIS SEMI FASHIONABLE SLIP SLOP WITHIN TWENTY YARDS OF THE WILD BEASTS DEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARRICADE SOUNDED STRANGE BUT MISTER FRERE THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT
THE DOOR OF THE BARRICADE WAS OPEN AND THE SENTRY A YOUNG SOLDIER OCCUPIED IN STARING AT THE RELIEF GUARD DID NOT NOTICE THE PRISONER PASS THROUGH IT
RICHARD TOOK UP THE BOOK AND READ IN GOLD LETTERS ON THE COVER LORD BELLASIS THE UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE BODY AND RAISED IT THE SKULL HAD BEEN FRACTURED BY A BLOW BUT IT SEEMED THAT LIFE YET LINGERED
HOPPED OVER THE BARRICADE AND ROLLED TO THE FEET OF RUFUS DAWES WHO WAS STILL LEANING APPARENTLY LOST IN THOUGHT AGAINST THE SIDE THE BRIGHT SPOT OF COLOUR ROLLING ACROSS THE WHITE DECK CAUGHT HIS EYE STOOPING MECHANICALLY HE PICKED UP THE BALL AND STEPPED FORWARD TO RETURN IT
AS THE SUN SANK THE RELIEF GUARD CAME UP THE AFTER HATCHWAY AND THE RELIEVED GUARD PREPARED TO SUPERINTEND THE DESCENT OF THE CONVICTS AT THIS MOMENT SYLVIA MISSED HER BALL WHICH TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A SUDDEN LURCH OF THE VESSEL
WITH THE NIGGARDLY ECONOMY OF HER HUSBAND
INSOLENT BLACKGUARDS AND THEN THE NOISE OF THE SENTRY ON THE QUARTER DECK BELOW HIM GROUNDING ARMS TURNED THE CURRENT OF HIS THOUGHTS A THIN TALL SOLDIER LIKE MAN WITH A COLD BLUE EYE AND PRIM FEATURES CAME OUT OF THE CUDDY BELOW
A DEED SO BLOODTHIRSTY AND A RESPITE SO UNEXPECTED HAD INVESTED THE NAME OF RUFUS DAWES WITH A GRIM DISTINCTION WHICH HIS SUPERIOR MENTAL ABILITIES NO LESS THAN HIS HAUGHTY TEMPER AND POWERFUL FRAME COMBINED TO SUPPORT
YOU CONFESS YOUR SHAME AND GLORY IN THE CONFESSION MOTHER DEAR MOTHER CRIED THE YOUNG MAN IN A PAROXYSM OF GRIEF SAY THAT YOU DID NOT MEAN THOSE WORDS YOU SAID THEM BUT IN ANGER SEE I AM CALM NOW AND HE MAY STRIKE ME IF HE WILL
THE YOUNG MAN ON THE POOP CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE TALL FIGURE LEANING AGAINST THE BULWARKS AND IT GAVE HIM AN EXCUSE TO BREAK THE MONOTONY OF HIS EMPLOYMENT
HOT YES DEAR ME MOST OPPRESSIVE JOHN THE CAMP STOOL PRAY MISTER FRERE OH THANK YOU SYLVIA SYLVIA JOHN HAVE YOU MY SMELLING SALTS STILL A CALM I SUPPOSE
SIR RICHARD DEVINE LAUGHED AGAIN I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU ARE SO WELL DISPOSED LISTEN NOW TO NIGHT I SEND FOR QUAID TO ALTER MY WILL MY SISTER'S SON MAURICE FRERE SHALL BE MY HEIR IN YOUR STEAD I GIVE YOU NOTHING
FASCINATION WAS AN INTEGRAL PORTION OF JULIA VICKERS'S NATURE ADMIRATION WAS ALL SHE LIVED FOR AND EVEN IN A CONVICT SHIP WITH HER HUSBAND AT HER ELBOW SHE MUST FLIRT OR PERISH OF MENTAL INANITION THERE WAS NO HARM IN THE CREATURE
THE MEN AND BOYS WERE PRISONERS OF THE CROWN AND THE CATTLE PEN WAS THEIR EXERCISE GROUND THEIR PRISON WAS DOWN THE MAIN HATCHWAY ON THE TWEEN DECKS AND THE BARRICADE CONTINUED DOWN MADE ITS SIDE WALLS
I DO NOT THINK HOWEVER THAT YOU WILL DISCOVER ANY EXAGGERATIONS SOME OF THE EVENTS NARRATED ARE DOUBTLESS TRAGIC AND TERRIBLE BUT I HOLD IT NEEDFUL TO MY PURPOSE TO RECORD THEM FOR THEY ARE EVENTS WHICH HAVE ACTUALLY OCCURRED
AT HALF PAST NINE RICHARD DEVINE QUITTED HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE TO BEGIN THE NEW LIFE HE HAD CHOSEN AND SO
IT SEEMED AN HOUR TO HIS EXCITED FANCY BEFORE HE SAW A LIGHT PASS ALONG THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE HE HAD QUITTED AND KNEW THAT SIR RICHARD HAD SAFELY REACHED HIS CHAMBER WITH SOME BEWILDERED INTENTION OF SUMMONING AID HE LEFT THE BODY AND MADE TOWARDS THE TOWN
AND SHE FOUND HIM HARSH DISENCHANTED AND COMMONPLACE A DAUGHTER BORN TWO YEARS AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE WAS THE ONLY LINK THAT BOUND THE ILL ASSORTED PAIR VICKERS IDOLIZED LITTLE SYLVIA
HE HAD STOOD THUS IN ONE PLACE OR ANOTHER EVER SINCE THE GROANING VESSEL HAD ESCAPED FROM THE ROLLERS OF THE BAY OF BISCAY AND THE MISERABLE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CREATURES AMONG WHOM HE WAS CLASSED HAD BEEN FREED FROM THEIR IRONS AND ALLOWED TO SNIFF FRESH AIR TWICE A DAY
HE HAD BEEN TRIED FOR THE ROBBERY AND MURDER OF LORD BELLASIS THE FRIENDLESS VAGABOND'S LAME STORY OF FINDING ON THE HEATH A DYING MAN WOULD NOT HAVE AVAILED HIM BUT FOR THE CURIOUS FACT SWORN TO BY THE LANDLORD OF THE SPANIARDS INN
AT FIRST THE YOUNG MAN SO RUDELY ASSAILED DID NOT COMPREHEND HIS OWN DANGER HIS MIND BENT UPON ONE HIDEOUS EXPLANATION OF THE CRIME DID NOT SEE ANOTHER OBVIOUS ONE WHICH HAD ALREADY OCCURRED TO THE MIND OF THE LANDLORD OF THE THREE SPANIARDS
AND AT A TURN OF THE PATH STUMBLED UPON SOMETHING WHICH HORRIBLY ACCOUNTED FOR THE CURIOUS ACTION OF THE OLD MAN A DEAD BODY LAY UPON ITS FACE IN THE HEATHER BESIDE IT WAS A HEAVY RIDING WHIP STAINED AT THE HANDLE WITH BLOOD AND AN OPEN POCKET BOOK
AND THEN HOLDING BY A STAY HE TURNED ABOUT AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE WAIST OF THE SHIP SAVE FOR THE MAN AT THE WHEEL AND THE GUARD AT THE QUARTER RAILING HE WAS ALONE ON THE DECK A FEW BIRDS FLEW ROUND ABOUT THE VESSEL AND SEEMED TO PASS UNDER HER STERN WINDOWS
AND WITHIN THE LAST YEAR FRANCE HAS ESTABLISHED AT NEW CALEDONIA A PENAL SETTLEMENT WHICH WILL IN THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS REPEAT IN ITS ANNALS THE HISTORY OF MACQUARIE HARBOUR AND OF NORFOLK ISLAND WITH THIS BRIEF PREFACE I BEG YOU TO ACCEPT THIS WORK
TO MORROW YOUR FATHER YOUR SISTERS ALL THE WORLD SHALL KNOW THE STORY YOU HAVE TOLD ME BY HEAVEN SIR YOU WILL NOT DO THIS BURST OUT THE YOUNG MAN SILENCE BASTARD CRIED SIR RICHARD
EVEN RAN DOWN TO THE QUARTER DECK AND PULLED THE COAT TAILS OF THE SENTRY ON DUTY AT LAST TIRED OF RUNNING ABOUT SHE TOOK A LITTLE STRIPED LEATHER BALL FROM THE BOSOM OF HER FROCK AND CALLING TO HER FATHER THREW IT UP TO HIM AS HE STOOD ON THE POOP
BUT UPON THE BIRTH OF THE SON WHO IS THE HERO OF THIS HISTORY HE AFFECTED A QUARREL WITH THE CITY KNIGHT
CHARLES READE HAS DRAWN THE INTERIOR OF A HOUSE OF CORRECTION IN ENGLAND AND VICTOR HUGO HAS SHOWN HOW A FRENCH CONVICT FARES AFTER THE FULFILMENT OF HIS SENTENCE BUT NO WRITER SO FAR AS I AM AWARE
CRINGED AND SUBMITTED WHEN THEY MET HIM FACE TO FACE FOR IN A CONVICT SHIP THE GREATEST VILLAIN IS THE GREATEST HERO AND THE ONLY NOBILITY ACKNOWLEDGED BY THAT HIDEOUS COMMONWEALTH IS THAT ORDER OF THE HALTER WHICH IS CONFERRED BY THE HAND OF THE HANGMAN
AND FEW OUT OF THE DOOMED HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WERE IGNORANT OF THE OFFENCE WHICH THEIR COMPANIONS HAD COMMITTED THE MORE GUILTY BOASTED OF THEIR SUPERIORITY IN VICE THE PETTY CRIMINALS SWORE THAT THEIR GUILT WAS BLACKER THAN IT APPEARED MOREOVER
OF THE POSSESSIONS OF THE HOUSE OF WOTTON WADE THIS OLD MANOR TIMBERLESS AND BARE WAS ALL THAT REMAINED AND ITS MASTER RARELY VISITED IT
WAS A PRODUCT OF HIS TIME OF GOOD FAMILY HIS ANCESTOR ARMIGELL WAS REPUTED TO HAVE LANDED IN AMERICA BEFORE GILBERT OR RALEIGH HE HAD INHERITED HIS MANOR OF BELLASIS OR BELSIZE
BUT HE WITH CAP PULLED OVER HIS BROWS AND HANDS THRUST INTO THE POCKETS OF HIS COARSE GREY GARMENTS HELD ALOOF FROM THEIR DISMAL JOVIALITY THE SUN POURED HIS HOTTEST RAYS ON HIS HEAD UNHEEDED
SO MADAM SAID SIR RICHARD IN THE HIGH STRUNG ACCENTS WHICH IN CRISES OF GREAT MENTAL AGONY ARE COMMON TO THE MOST SELF RESTRAINED OF US YOU HAVE BEEN FOR TWENTY YEARS A LIVING LIE
BATTERED IN HEALTH AND RUINED IN POCKET BUT WHO BY DINT OF STAYS HAIR DYE AND COURAGE YET FACED THE WORLD WITH UNDAUNTED FRONT AND DINED AS GAILY IN BAILIFF HAUNTED BELSIZE AS HE HAD DINED AT CARLTON HOUSE
TO PURSUE THERE THE SAME RECKLESS LIFE WHICH IN LONDON HAD OFFENDED SIR RICHARD SIR RICHARD UPON THIS SENT FOR MAURICE FRERE HIS SISTER'S SON THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE TRADE HAD RUINED THE BRISTOL HOUSE OF FRERE
OVERCOME WITH HORROR FOR HE COULD NOT DOUBT BUT THAT HIS MOTHER'S WORST FEARS HAD BEEN REALIZED RICHARD KNELT THERE HOLDING HIS MURDERED FATHER IN HIS ARMS WAITING UNTIL THE MURDERER WHOSE NAME HE BORE SHOULD HAVE PLACED HIMSELF BEYOND PURSUIT
FOR TWENTY YEARS IN COMPANY WITH A SCOUNDREL WHOSE NAME IS A BYWORD FOR ALL THAT IS PROFLIGATE AND BASE YOU HAVE LAUGHED AT ME FOR A CREDULOUS AND HOOD WINKED FOOL AND NOW BECAUSE I DARED TO RAISE MY HAND TO THAT RECKLESS BOY
INDEED IF THERE HAD BEEN NOBODY ELSE NEAR IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT SHE WOULD HAVE DISDAINFULLY FASCINATED THE TWEEN DECKS AND MADE EYES AT THE MOST PRESENTABLE OF THE CONVICTS THERE VICKERS WITH A BOW TO FRERE SAW HIS WIFE UP THE LADDER AND THEN TURNED FOR HIS DAUGHTER
HE RETURNED IT AND SHOUTING WITH LAUGHTER CLAPPING HER HANDS BETWEEN EACH THROW THE CHILD KEPT UP THE GAME THE CONVICTS WHOSE SLICE OF FRESH AIR WAS NEARLY EATEN TURNED WITH EAGERNESS TO WATCH THIS NEW SOURCE OF AMUSEMENT
AND THOUGH EVERY CRANNY AND SEAM IN THE DECK SWELTERED HOT PITCH UNDER THE FIERCE HEAT THE MAN STOOD THERE MOTIONLESS AND MOROSE STARING AT THE SLEEPY SEA
ONE WAS AN OLD MAN WHOSE WHITE HAIR AND WRINKLED FACE GAVE TOKEN THAT HE WAS AT LEAST SIXTY YEARS OF AGE HE STOOD ERECT WITH HIS BACK TO THE WALL WHICH SEPARATES THE GARDEN FROM THE HEATH IN THE ATTITUDE OF ONE SURPRISED INTO SUDDEN PASSION
HE MARRIED HIS SISTER TO A WEALTHY BRISTOL MERCHANT ONE ANTHONY FRERE
GO DOWN BELOW AND REMEMBER WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU CRIED FRERE AND COMPREHENDING AT ONCE WHAT HAD OCCURRED HE MADE A MENTAL MINUTE OF THE NAME OF THE DEFAULTING SENTRY THE CONVICT WIPING THE BLOOD FROM HIS FACE TURNED ON HIS HEEL WITHOUT A WORD
TRIED TO RESTRAIN HIM BUT THE HEAD STRONG BOY THOUGH OWNING FOR HIS MOTHER THAT STRONG LOVE WHICH IS OFTEN A PART OF SUCH VIOLENT NATURES PROVED INTRACTABLE AND AFTER THREE YEARS OF PARENTAL FEUD HE WENT OFF TO THE CONTINENT
FAMILIARITY DESTROYS TERROR AND THE INCURABLE FLIRT FLUTTERED HER MUSLINS AND PLAYED OFF HER SECOND RATE GRACES UNDER THE NOSES OF THE GRINNING CONVICTS WITH AS MUCH COMPLACENCY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN IN A CHATHAM BALL ROOM
DESPITE MISSUS VICKERS'S REITERATED OBJECTIONS ON THE SCORE OF EDUCATIONAL DIFFICULTIES HE COULD EDUCATE HER HIMSELF IF NEED BE HE SAID AND SHE SHOULD NOT STAY AT HOME SO MISSUS VICKERS AFTER A HARD STRUGGLE GAVE UP THE POINT AND HER DREAMS OF BATH TOGETHER
UNDER CAREFUL SUPERVISION AND A JUST RULE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GUIDED TO GOOD BUT LEFT TO HIS OWN DEVICES OUTSIDE AND GALLED BY THE IRON YOKE OF PARENTAL DISCIPLINE AT HOME HE BECAME RECKLESS AND PRODIGAL
INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND CHILDISH PRATTLE WERE STRANGE TO THEM SOME SMILED AND NODDED WITH INTEREST IN THE VARYING FORTUNES OF THE GAME ONE YOUNG LAD COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN HIMSELF FROM APPLAUDING IT WAS AS THOUGH OUT OF THE SULTRY HEAT WHICH BROODED OVER THE SHIP
IN THE DELICATE MATTER OF MENDOZA
STRODE DOWN THE GARDEN WITH THE VIGOUR THAT ANGER LENDS AND TOOK THE ROAD TO LONDON RICHARD CRIED THE POOR MOTHER FORGIVE ME MY SON I HAVE RUINED YOU
EITHER TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF OR TO PURCHASE A CHANCE OF SAFETY AT THE PRICE OF HIS MOTHER'S DISHONOUR AND THE DEATH OF THE MAN WHOM HIS MOTHER HAD DECEIVED IF THE OUTCAST SON WERE BROUGHT A PRISONER TO NORTH END HOUSE SIR RICHARD NOW DOUBLY OPPRESSED OF FATE
THE DUC DE CHARTRES AND THEY SAY THE FOOL IS NOT YET NINETEEN FROM A PIGEON ARMIGELL WADE BECAME A HAWK AND AT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE HAVING LOST TOGETHER WITH HIS ESTATES ALL CHANCE OF WINNING THE ONE WOMAN WHO MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIM
A YOUNG MAN OF TWO AND TWENTY OWNING TO NO FRIENDS AND EXISTING AMONG THEM BUT BY THE FACT OF HIS CRIMINALITY HE WAS RESPECTED AND ADMIRED
IT WAS THE FAG END OF THE TWO HOURS EXERCISE GRACIOUSLY PERMITTED EACH AFTERNOON BY HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE THE FOURTH TO PRISONERS OF THE CROWN AND THE PRISONERS OF THE CROWN WERE ENJOYING THEMSELVES IT WAS NOT PERHAPS SO PLEASANT AS UNDER THE AWNING ON THE POOP DECK
WHAT'S YOUR NAME EH HE REPEATED THE ROUGH QUESTION TWICE BEFORE HIS PRISONER ANSWERED
HER SCARLET LIPS SHOWED HER WHITE EVEN TEETH HE KNEW HER AT ONCE SHE WAS SARAH PURFOY MISSUS VICKERS'S MAID BUT HE NEVER HAD BEEN SO CLOSE TO HER BEFORE AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF SOME STRANGE TROPICAL FLOWER
IF I CATCH YOU PUTTING YOUR FOOT ON THE QUARTER DECK AGAIN I'LL GIVE YOU A WEEK IN IRONS RUFUS DAWES PALE WITH RAGE AND MORTIFICATION OPENED HIS MOUTH TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF BUT HE ALLOWED THE WORDS TO DIE ON HIS LIPS WHAT WAS THE USE
THAT POSITIVELY SHE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT SKY AND BELIEVED THAT WICKED MISTER FRERE WAS DOING IT ON PURPOSE BY AND BY CAPTAIN BLUNT APPEARED AND TAKING THE GLASS FROM HIS OFFICER LOOKED THROUGH IT LONG AND CAREFULLY
RICHARD FORGIVE ME PRAY FOR ME HUSH DEAREST COME LET ME LEAD YOU IN I WILL WRITE I WILL SEND YOU NEWS OF ME ONCE AT LEAST ERE I DEPART SO YOU ARE CALMER MOTHER
HE HAD CRINGED AND CRAWLED AND FLUTTERED AND BLUSTERED HAD LICKED THE DUST OFF GREAT MEN'S SHOES AND DANCED ATTENDANCE IN GREAT MEN'S ANTE CHAMBERS NOTHING WAS TOO LOW NOTHING TOO HIGH FOR HIM
AND FOLLOWED HER HUSBAND WITH THE BEST GRACE SHE COULD MUSTER WHEN FAIRLY OUT TO SEA SHE SEEMED RECONCILED TO HER FATE AND EMPLOYED THE INTERVALS BETWEEN SCOLDING HER DAUGHTER AND HER MAID IN FASCINATING THE BOORISH YOUNG LIEUTENANT MAURICE FRERE
FRERE WHO FOUND MISSUS VICKERS'S CONVERSATION A LITTLE TIRESOME AND HAD BEEN GLANCING FROM TIME TO TIME AT THE COMPANION AS THOUGH IN EXPECTATION OF SOMEONE APPEARING NOTICED THE ACTION WHAT IS IT MISTER BEST
I WOULD THAT ITS MERITS WERE EQUAL EITHER TO YOUR KINDNESS OR TO MY REGARD
THOSE MEN IN WHOM EMOTION HAS THE EFFECT OF QUICKENING CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD REASON RAPIDLY IN MOMENTS OF DANGER AND IN THE TERRIBLE INSTANT WHEN HIS EYES MET THOSE OF LORD BELLASIS RICHARD DEVINE HAD SUMMED UP THE CHANCES OF HIS FUTURE FORTUNE
HE HAD AVOWED HIS INTENTION OF STRIKING ACROSS HAMPSTEAD TO BELSIZE I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT THE FIR TREES ON THE HEATH HE SAID WITH A WOMAN ASKED MISTER CROFTON NOT AT ALL WITH A PARSON A PARSON YOU STARE
LOOK YE HE CRIED IN SUDDEN FURY I AM NOT TO BE FOOLED SO EASILY YOUR FAMILY ARE PROUD COLONEL WADE HAS OTHER DAUGHTERS YOUR LOVER MY LORD BELLASIS EVEN NOW THINKS TO RETRIEVE HIS BROKEN FORTUNES BY MARRIAGE YOU HAVE CONFESSED YOUR SHAME
MISSUS VICKERS WAS FORTY TWO SHE OWNED TO THIRTY THREE AND HAD BEEN A GARRISON BELLE FOR ELEVEN WEARY YEARS BEFORE SHE MARRIED PRIM JOHN VICKERS THE MARRIAGE WAS NOT A HAPPY ONE VICKERS FOUND HIS WIFE EXTRAVAGANT VAIN AND SNAPPISH
IF YOU DIDN'T MURDER HIM YOU ROBBED HIM GROWLED MOGFORD AND YOU SHALL SLEEP AT BOW STREET TO NIGHT TOM RUN ON TO MEET THE PATROL
KISSED THE PALE FACE AND TURNED HIS OWN SCARCELY LESS PALE TOWARDS THE OLD MAN I OWE YOU NO DUTY HE SAID YOU HAVE ALWAYS HATED AND REVILED ME WHEN BY YOUR VIOLENCE YOU DROVE ME FROM YOUR HOUSE YOU SET SPIES TO WATCH ME IN THE LIFE I HAD CHOSEN
A TERROR OF I KNOW NOT WHAT COMING EVIL OVERPOWERS ME I TREMBLE FOR THE FUTURE
BUT IN THE WAIST A CURIOUS SIGHT PRESENTED ITSELF IT WAS AS THOUGH ONE HAD BUILT A CATTLE PEN THERE AT THE FOOT OF THE FOREMAST AND AT THE QUARTER DECK A STRONG BARRICADE LOOP HOLED AND FURNISHED WITH DOORS FOR INGRESS AND EGRESS
WHO NEITHER DICED NOR DRANK LIKE A GENTLEMAN DEPARTED MORE DESPERATELY AT WAR WITH FORTUNE THAN EVER FOR HIS OLD HAUNTS
MOTHER DEAR MOTHER DO NOT WEEP HE SAID
GOD DEFEND ME CRIED MISTER MOGFORD SCANNING BY THE PALE LIGHT OF THE RISING MOON THE FEATURES OF THE MURDERED MAN BUT IT IS LORD BELLASIS OH YOU BLOODY VILLAIN JEM BRING HIM ALONG HERE P'R'APS HIS LORDSHIP CAN RECOGNIZE HIM
HANDING OUT A FAIR HAIRED AFFECTED MINCING LADY OF MIDDLE AGE CAPTAIN VICKERS OF MISTER FRERE'S REGIMENT ORDERED FOR SERVICE IN VAN DIEMEN'S LAND WAS BRINGING HIS LADY ON DECK TO GET AN APPETITE FOR DINNER
ONLY TO APPEAR AGAIN AT HER BOWS A LAZY ALBATROSS WITH THE WHITE WATER FLASHING FROM HIS WINGS ROSE WITH A DABBLING SOUND TO LEEWARD AND IN THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN GLIDED THE HIDEOUS FIN OF A SILENTLY SWIMMING SHARK
RUFUS DAWES WAS NOT IN THE GANGWAY WAS IN FACT A GOOD TWO FEET FROM IT BUT AT THE SOUND OF LIEUTENANT FRERE'S VOICE HE STARTED AND WENT OBEDIENTLY TOWARDS THE HATCHWAY TOUCH YOUR HAT YOU DOG CRIES FRERE COMING TO THE QUARTER RAILING
CHAPTER ONE THE PRISON SHIP IN THE BREATHLESS STILLNESS OF A TROPICAL AFTERNOON WHEN THE AIR WAS HOT AND HEAVY AND THE SKY BRAZEN AND CLOUDLESS THE SHADOW OF THE MALABAR LAY SOLITARY ON THE SURFACE OF THE GLITTERING SEA
THIS CONTRACT WAS THE THIN END OF THAT WEDGE WHICH EVENTUALLY SPLIT THE MIGHTY OAK BLOCK OF GOVERNMENT PATRONAGE INTO THREE DECKERS AND SHIPS OF THE LINE
WHEN HE WAS TOLD BY THIN LIPPED COOL COLONEL WADE THAT THE RICH SHIPBUILDER SIR RICHARD DEVINE
SIR RICHARD DEVINE KNIGHT SHIPBUILDER NAVAL CONTRACTOR AND MILLIONAIRE WAS THE SON OF A HARWICH BOAT CARPENTER EARLY LEFT AN ORPHAN WITH A SISTER TO SUPPORT HE SOON REDUCED HIS SOLE AIM IN LIFE TO THE ACCUMULATION OF MONEY
THE MAN TO WHOSE KINDNESS HE OWED EDUCATION AND FORMER FORTUNE HE KNELT STUPEFIED UNABLE TO SPEAK OR MOVE COME CRIED MOGFORD AGAIN SAY MY LORD IS THIS THE VILLAIN
IT WAS NOT I CRIED RICHARD DEVINE FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LORD SAY THEN HE STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND BEING FORCED ON HIS KNEES BY HIS CAPTORS REMAINED STARING AT THE DYING MAN IN SUDDEN AND GHASTLY FEAR
FRERE BIT HIS THICK LIPS WITH MORTIFICATION AS HE FOLLOWED THE GIRL INTO THE CUDDY SARAH PURFOY HOWEVER TAKING THE ASTONISHED SYLVIA BY THE HAND
AND HAVING TO DO WITH THE HISTORY OF PAST COLONIAL DAYS SHOULD BEAR YOUR NAME UPON ITS DEDICATORY PAGE BUT BECAUSE THE PUBLICATION OF MY BOOK IS DUE TO YOUR ADVICE AND ENCOURAGEMENT THE CONVICT OF FICTION HAS BEEN HITHERTO SHOWN ONLY AT THE BEGINNING OR AT THE END OF HIS CAREER
AND LONG DESCENDED WOTTON WADE THERE HAD LONG BEEN LITTLE LOVE
HER IDLE SAILS FLAPPED AGAINST HER MASTS WITH A REGULARLY RECURRING NOISE AND HER BOWSPRIT WOULD SEEM TO RISE HIGHER WITH THE WATER'S SWELL TO DIP AGAIN WITH A JERK THAT MADE EACH ROPE TREMBLE AND TAUTEN
AND HE WOULD HAVE SLUNK PAST IN THE GLOOM
YOUR FATHER WAS A MAN OF FASHION A GAMBLER THE FRIEND OF RAKES AND PRODIGALS I WAS RICH I HAD BEEN KNIGHTED I WAS IN FAVOUR AT COURT HE WANTED MONEY AND HE SOLD YOU I PAID THE PRICE HE ASKED BUT THERE WAS NOTHING OF YOUR COUSIN MY LORD BELLASIS AND WOTTON IN THE BOND
AND HAD HEARD THAT OVER CLARET AND CARDS LORD BELLASIS AND HIS FRIENDS HAD OFTEN LAMENTED THE HARD FORTUNE WHICH GAVE THE BEAUTY ELLINOR TO SO SORDID A BRIDEGROOM
AND BOUGHT FOR HIM A COMMISSION IN A MARCHING REGIMENT HINTING DARKLY OF SPECIAL FAVOURS TO COME HIS OPEN PREFERENCE FOR HIS NEPHEW HAD GALLED TO THE QUICK HIS SENSITIVE WIFE WHO CONTRASTED WITH SOME HEART PANGS THE GALLANT PRODIGALITY OF HER FATHER
OUTSIDE THIS CATTLE PEN AN ARMED SENTRY STOOD ON GUARD INSIDE STANDING SITTING OR WALKING MONOTONOUSLY WITHIN RANGE OF THE SHINING BARRELS IN THE ARM CHEST ON THE POOP WERE SOME SIXTY MEN AND BOYS DRESSED IN UNIFORM GREY
YOU WOULD NOT PART ME FROM MY ONLY SON CRIED THE WRETCHED WOMAN TAKE HIM WITH YOU TO HIS FATHER THEN RICHARD DEVINE GENTLY LOOSED THE ARMS THAT AGAIN CLUNG AROUND HIS NECK
WHO MOST NEED FORGIVENESS LET ME SHARE YOUR BURDEN THAT I MAY LIGHTEN IT HE IS JUST IT IS FITTING THAT I GO I CAN EARN A NAME A NAME THAT I NEED NOT BLUSH TO BEAR NOR YOU TO HEAR I AM STRONG I CAN WORK THE WORLD IS WIDE
I HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH YOU I HAVE LONG FELT IT NOW WHEN I LEARN FOR THE FIRST TIME WHOSE SON I REALLY AM I REJOICE TO THINK THAT I HAVE LESS TO THANK YOU FOR THAN I ONCE BELIEVED I ACCEPT THE TERMS YOU OFFER I WILL GO NAY MOTHER THINK OF YOUR GOOD NAME
THANK YOU MISTER FRERE THESE HORRID LADDERS
WHAT IS IT SIR SHE ASKED RISING BUT TREMBLING WITH TERROR AS SHE STOOD WITH DROOPING ARMS AND WIDELY OPENED EYES THE OLD MAN LOOKED AT HER FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN SAID SLOWLY THAT THIS IMPOSTOR WHO SO LONG HAS FALSELY BORNE MY NAME
THE SUN WHO ROSE ON THE LEFT HAND EVERY MORNING A BLAZING BALL TO MOVE SLOWLY THROUGH THE UNBEARABLE BLUE UNTIL HE SANK FIERY RED IN MINGLING GLORIES OF SKY AND OCEAN ON THE RIGHT HAND
AND REALIZED TO THE FULL HIS PERSONAL PERIL THE RUNAWAY HORSE HAD GIVEN THE ALARM THE DRINKERS AT THE SPANIARDS INN HAD STARTED TO SEARCH THE HEATH AND HAD DISCOVERED A FELLOW IN ROUGH COSTUME WHOSE PERSON WAS UNKNOWN TO THEM HASTILY QUITTING A SPOT WHERE
THE FOURTH LORD BELLASIS COMBINED THE DARING OF ARMIGELL THE ADVENTURER
LADY DEVINE SHUDDERED CREEPING CLOSE AS THOUGH TO HIDE HERSELF IN THE BROAD BOSOM OF HER SON THE OLD MAN CONTINUED I MARRIED YOU ELLINOR WADE FOR YOUR BEAUTY YOU MARRIED ME FOR MY FORTUNE I WAS A PLEBEIAN A SHIP'S CARPENTER YOU WERE WELL BORN
THEN MISSUS VICKERS MUST OF COURSE LOOK ALSO AND WAS PRETTILY AFFECTED ABOUT THE FOCUS OF THE GLASS APPLYING HERSELF TO THAT INSTRUMENT WITH MUCH GIRLISH GIGGLING AND FINALLY DECLARING AFTER SHUTTING ONE EYE WITH HER FAIR HAND
AND TO BE SUBMITTED TO A DISCIPLINE WHICH MUST NECESSARILY DEPEND FOR ITS JUST ADMINISTRATION UPON THE PERSONAL CHARACTER AND TEMPER OF THEIR GAOLERS YOUR CRITICAL FACULTY WILL DOUBTLESS FIND IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND ARTISTIC WORKING OF THIS BOOK MANY FAULTS
A LADY OF MIDDLE AGE THE FACE OF THE YOUNG MAN WORE AN EXPRESSION OF HORROR STRICKEN ASTONISHMENT AND THE SLIGHT FRAME OF THE GREY HAIRED WOMAN WAS CONVULSED WITH SOBS
TWO OTHER MEN WAITED AS EAGERLY ONE MISTER LIONEL CROFTON
AND TO ILLUSTRATE IN THE MANNER BEST CALCULATED AS I THINK TO ATTRACT GENERAL ATTENTION THE INEXPEDIENCY OF AGAIN ALLOWING OFFENDERS AGAINST THE LAW TO BE HERDED TOGETHER IN PLACES REMOTE FROM THE WHOLESOME INFLUENCE OF PUBLIC OPINION
CONSIDERED HIM FORTUNATE WHEN HIS SENTENCE WAS COMMUTED TO TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE IT WAS CUSTOMARY ON BOARD THESE FLOATING PRISONS TO KEEP EACH MAN'S CRIME A SECRET FROM HIS FELLOWS
WHICH EXFOLIATED AND RAMIFIED INTO HUGE DOCKYARDS AT PLYMOUTH PORTSMOUTH AND SHEERNESS AND BORE AS ITS BUDS AND FLOWERS COUNTLESS BARRELS OF MEASLY PORK AND MAGGOTY BISCUIT
I AM THE SON OF SIR RICHARD DEVINE COME WITH ME TO YONDER HOUSE AND I WILL PROVE TO YOU THAT I HAVE BUT JUST QUITTED IT TO PLACE HIS INNOCENCE BEYOND IMMEDIATE QUESTION THAT COURSE OF ACTION WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOW
AY BITE YOUR LIPS THE WORD IS OF YOUR PRECIOUS MOTHER'S MAKING LADY DEVINE SLIPPED THROUGH HER SON'S ARMS AND FELL ON HER KNEES AT HER HUSBAND'S FEET DO NOT DO THIS RICHARD I HAVE BEEN FAITHFUL TO YOU FOR TWO AND TWENTY YEARS
IN ANOTHER INSTANT HE WAS ON THE SACRED QUARTER DECK HEATED WITH THE GAME HER CHEEKS AGLOW HER EYES SPARKLING HER GOLDEN HAIR AFLOAT SYLVIA HAD TURNED TO LEAP AFTER HER PLAYTHING BUT EVEN AS SHE TURNED FROM UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE CUDDY GLIDED A ROUNDED WHITE ARM
YOU LEAVE THIS HOUSE IN AN HOUR YOU CHANGE YOUR NAME YOU NEVER BY WORD OR DEED MAKE CLAIM ON ME OR MINE NO MATTER WHAT STRAIT OR POVERTY YOU PLEAD IF EVEN YOUR LIFE SHOULD HANG UPON THE ISSUE THE INSTANT I HEAR THAT THERE EXISTS ON EARTH ONE WHO CALLS HIMSELF RICHARD DEVINE
SHE RAN HITHER AND THITHER ASKED QUESTIONS INVENTED ANSWERS LAUGHED SANG GAMBOLLED PEERED INTO THE COMPASS CASE FELT IN THE POCKETS OF THE MAN AT THE HELM PUT HER TINY HAND INTO THE BIG PALM OF THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH
AND A SHAPELY HAND CAUGHT THE CHILD BY THE SASH AND DREW HER BACK THE NEXT MOMENT THE YOUNG MAN IN GREY HAD PLACED THE TOY IN HER HAND MAURICE FRERE DESCENDING THE POOP LADDER HAD NOT WITNESSED THIS LITTLE INCIDENT
THEN WE MUST PUSH ON FOR IT GROWS LATE THANKS MY DEAR SIR FOR THE WE BUT I MUST GO ALONE SAID LORD BELLASIS DRYLY TO MORROW YOU CAN SETTLE WITH ME FOR THE SITTING OF LAST WEEK HARK THE CLOCK IS STRIKING NINE GOOD NIGHT
SO THAT IF HE CHOSE AND THE CAPRICE OF HIS GAOLERS ALLOWED HIM HE COULD LEAD A NEW LIFE IN HIS ADOPTED HOME WITHOUT BEING TAUNTED WITH HIS FORMER MISDEEDS BUT LIKE OTHER EXCELLENT DEVICES THE EXPEDIENT WAS ONLY A NOMINAL ONE
HE LAUGHED AND IN THAT LAUGH HIS FURY SEEMED TO CONGEAL INTO A COLD AND CRUEL HATE YOU WOULD PRESERVE YOUR GOOD NAME THEN YOU WOULD CONCEAL THIS DISGRACE FROM THE WORLD YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR WISH UPON ONE CONDITION
THAT THE MURDERED NOBLEMAN HAD SHAKEN HIS HEAD WHEN ASKED IF THE PRISONER WAS HIS ASSASSIN THE VAGABOND WAS ACQUITTED OF THE MURDER BUT CONDEMNED TO DEATH FOR THE ROBBERY AND LONDON WHO TOOK SOME INTEREST IN THE TRIAL
ON REACHING THE DECK HE SAW ONLY THE UNEXPLAINED PRESENCE OF THE CONVICT UNIFORM THANK YOU SAID A VOICE AS RUFUS DAWES STOOPED BEFORE THE POUTING SYLVIA THE CONVICT RAISED HIS EYES AND SAW A YOUNG GIRL OF EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE TALL AND WELL DEVELOPED
ALLIED TO THIS POWERFUL HOUSE THE FAMILY TREE OF WOTTON WADE GREW AND FLOURISHED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR PHILIP THIRD BARON MARRIED THE CELEBRATED BEAUTY MISS POVEY
DEDICATION TO SIR CHARLES GAVAN DUFFY MY DEAR SIR CHARLES I TAKE LEAVE TO DEDICATE THIS WORK TO YOU NOT MERELY BECAUSE YOUR NINETEEN YEARS OF POLITICAL AND LITERARY LIFE IN AUSTRALIA RENDER IT VERY FITTING
I HAVE BORNE ALL THE SLIGHTS AND INSULTS YOU HAVE HEAPED UPON ME THE SHAMEFUL SECRET OF MY EARLY LOVE BROKE FROM ME WHEN IN YOUR RAGE YOU THREATENED HIM LET ME GO AWAY KILL ME BUT DO NOT SHAME ME
NO SOONER HAD HE BECOME MASTER OF HIS FORTUNE THAN HE TOOK TO DICE DRINK AND DEBAUCHERY WITH ALL THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF THE LAST CENTURY HE WAS FOREMOST IN EVERY RIOT MOST NOTORIOUS OF ALL THE NOTORIOUS BLOODS OF THE DAY
HE WAS RAISED TO THE PEERAGE IN SIXTEEN SIXTY SEVEN BY THE TITLE OF BARON BELLASIS AND WOTTON AND MARRIED FOR HIS SECOND WIFE ANNE DAUGHTER OF PHILIP STANHOPE SECOND EARL OF CHESTERFIELD
HORACE WALPOLE IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS TO SELWYN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE MENTIONS A FACT WHICH MAY STAND FOR A PAGE OF NARRATIVE YOUNG WADE HE SAYS
HE SWORE WITH FIERCE KNITTING OF HIS BLACK BROWS THAT NO LAW OF MAN NOR HEAVEN SHOULD FURTHER RESTRAIN HIM IN HIS SELFISH PRODIGALITY YOU HAVE SOLD YOUR DAUGHTER AND RUINED ME HE SAID LOOK TO THE CONSEQUENCES
IN THE HARWICH BOAT SHED NEARLY FIFTY YEARS BEFORE HE HAD CONTRACTED IN DEFIANCE OF PROPHESIED FAILURE TO BUILD THE HASTINGS SLOOP OF WAR FOR HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE THE THIRD'S LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY
HAS WRONGFULLY SQUANDERED MY MONEY AND UNLAWFULLY EATEN MY BREAD SHALL PACK THAT HE ABANDON FOR EVER THE NAME HE HAS USURPED KEEP HIMSELF FROM MY SIGHT AND NEVER SET FOOT AGAIN IN HOUSE OF MINE
HAS ATTEMPTED TO DEPICT THE DISMAL CONDITION OF A FELON DURING HIS TERM OF TRANSPORTATION I HAVE ENDEAVOURED IN HIS NATURAL LIFE TO SET FORTH THE WORKING AND THE RESULTS OF AN ENGLISH SYSTEM OF TRANSPORTATION CAREFULLY CONSIDERED AND CARRIED OUT UNDER OFFICIAL SUPERVISION
THE WEALTH OF THE HOUSE WAS FURTHER INCREASED BY THE UNION OF HER DAUGHTER SYBIL WITH MARMADUKE WADE MARMADUKE WADE WAS A LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY AND A PATRON OF PEPYS WHO IN HIS DIARY JULY SEVENTEENTH SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT SPEAKS OF VISITING HIM AT BELSIZE
A COOL BREEZE HAD SUDDENLY ARISEN IN THE MIDST OF THIS MIRTH THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH GLANCING ROUND THE FAST CRIMSONING HORIZON PAUSED ABRUPTLY AND SHADING HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND LOOKED OUT INTENTLY TO THE WESTWARD
THEN THE MIZENTOP WAS APPEALED TO AND DECLARED THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING AND AT LAST THE SUN WENT DOWN WITH A JERK AS THOUGH IT HAD SLIPPED THROUGH A SLIT IN THE SEA AND THE BLACK SPOT SWALLOWED UP IN THE GATHERING HAZE WAS SEEN NO MORE
AND WHICH IF THE BLUNDERS WHICH PRODUCED THEM BE REPEATED MUST INFALLIBLY OCCUR AGAIN IT IS TRUE THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAVE CEASED TO DEPORT THE CRIMINALS OF ENGLAND BUT THE METHOD OF PUNISHMENT OF WHICH THAT DEPORTATION WAS A PART IS STILL IN EXISTENCE
IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO WRITE AGAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS AS I WILL BE VERY BUSY GETTING SETTLED IN THE HOUSE I MUST GET THINGS ARRANGED JUST AS SOON AS I CAN SO I WILL BE ABLE TO GO OUT ON HORSEBACK WITH FAYE AND LIEUTENANT BALDWIN
AT ONE TIME I HAD TWO FULL TRAINLOADS BETWEEN THE PACIFIC AND THE ATLANTIC ON THEIR WAY TO LONDON I SPENT FOUR WINTERS IN LONDON DEALING IN THE HOP MARKET LITTLE AS I HAD THOUGHT EVER TO HANDLE AN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
THAT CAME TO HAVE GREAT IMPORTANCE IN MARCH OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE CHARLES WOOD OF OLYMPIA
GENERAL AND MISSUS PHILLIPS GAVE US A MOST CORDIAL WELCOME JUST AS THOUGH THEY HAD KNOWN US ALWAYS DINNER WAS SERVED SOON AFTER WE ARRIVED AND THE CHEERFUL DINING ROOM AND THE TABLE WITH ITS DAINTY CHINA AND BRIGHT SILVER WAS SUCH A SURPRISE
WE WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET IN THE AMBULANCE AND START ON OUR WAY TO THE POST BUT ALAS OUR TROUBLES WERE NOT OVER THE MULES MUST HAVE FELT THE EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR
THE CAPTAINS SEEM TO HAVE THE BEST OF EVERYTHING AND THE LIEUTENANTS ARE EXPECTED TO GET ALONG WITH SMALLER HOUSES MUCH LESS PAY AND MUCH LESS EVERYTHING ELSE AND AT THE SAME TIME PERFORM ALL OF THE DISAGREEABLE DUTIES
AND I FORGAVE THE DEBT TAKING NO JUDGMENTS AGAINST THEM AND I HAVE NEVER REGRETTED THE ACTION ALL MY ACCUMULATIONS WERE SWEPT AWAY AND I QUIT THE BUSINESS OR RATHER THE BUSINESS QUIT ME
THERE WAS ONLY THE ONE SMALL DOOR TO THE LITTLE ADOBE SHOP AND INTO THIS AN INDIAN HAD RIDDEN HIS PIEBALD PONY ITS FOREFEET WERE UP A STEP ON THE SILL AND ITS HEAD AND SHOULDERS WERE IN THE ROOM
AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT THEY TELL ME BUT IN FAYE'S COMPANY THE CAPTAIN IS CALLED GENERAL AND THE FIRST LIEUTENANT IS CALLED MAJOR
I HAVE WANTED TO SEE WITH MY VERY OWN EYES AN INDIAN A REAL NOBLE RED MAN DRESSED IN BEAUTIFUL SKINS EMBROIDERED WITH BEADS AND ON HIS HEAD LONG WAVING FEATHERS WELL
FAYE WILL BE SIMPLY FINE ALL THE TIME IN HIS BRAND NEW UNIFORM PERHAPS I CAN SEND A LONG LETTER SOON IF I LIVE TO REACH THAT ARMY POST THAT STILL SEEMS SO FAR AWAY
I SUPPOSE FOR ONCE I CALLED GENERAL PHILLIPS MISTER IT SO HAPPENED TOO THAT JUST THAT INSTANT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND IN THE ROOM SO EVERYONE HEARD THE BLUNDER GENERAL PHILLIPS STRAIGHTENED BACK IN HIS CHAIR
SAID AT THAT TIME TO BE THE LARGEST EXPORT HOP BUSINESS
AND PERHAPS BY THAT TIME IT WILL BE JUST AND FAIR FOR THE LIEUTENANTS TO HAVE EVERYTHING WE SAW OUR HOUSE YESTERDAY QUARTERS I MUST LEARN TO SAY
FINALLY HE RECOVERED SUFFICIENT BREATH TO TELL ME THAT AT PRESENT THERE WERE NO GOOD CARPENTERS IN THE COMPANY LATER ON HOWEVER I LEARNED THAT ONLY CAPTAINS AND OFFICERS OF HIGHER RANK CAN HAVE SUCH THINGS
IT SEEMS THAT IN THE ARMY LIEUTENANTS ARE CALLED MISTER ALWAYS
THEN OUT OVER THE BAR TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND DOWN TO SAN FRANCISCO THEN THERE WAS THE SEVEN DAYS JOURNEY OVER THE CENTRAL AND UNION PACIFIC AND CONNECTING LINES THIS MEANT SITTING BOLT UPRIGHT ALL THE WAY
ALL OF THE OFFICERS QUARTERS ARE NEW AND THIS SET HAS NEVER BEEN OCCUPIED IT HAS A HALL WITH A PRETTY STAIRWAY THREE ROOMS AND A LARGE SHED DOWNSTAIRS
INDIAN TERRITORY IN THE SPRING IT MUST BE A MOST DREADFUL PLACE WITH OLD LOG HOUSES BUILT IN THE HOT SAND HILLS AND SURROUNDED BY ALMOST EVERY TRIBE OF HOSTILE INDIANS
JUST AS THEY HAD COME IN THEY INSTANTLY MOUNTED THEIR PONIES AND ALL RODE DOWN THE STREET AND OUT OF SIGHT AT RACE SPEED SOME LEANING SO FAR OVER ON THEIR LITTLE BEASTS THAT ONE COULD HARDLY SEE THE INDIAN AT ALL
IT IS AMAZING TO SEE HOW TRACTABLE THE INDIANS CAN MAKE THEIR PONIES WITH ONLY THAT ONE REIN
WHICH MADE IT QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US THREE FRIGHTENED WOMEN TO RUN OUT IN THE STREET SO WE GOT BACK OF A COUNTER AND AS MISSUS PHILLIPS EXPRESSED IT MIDWAY BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP SEA
THE ACREAGE PLANTED TO HOPS WAS INCREASED UNTIL THE CROP YIELD OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO A YIELD OF MORE THAN SEVENTY ONE TONS GAVE THE PUYALLUP VALLEY THE BANNER CROP AS TO QUANTITY OF THE UNITED STATES
WE ACTUALLY PRESSED THE ENGLISH GROWERS SO CLOSELY THAT MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND ACRES OF HOPS WERE DESTROYED IN THAT COUNTRY OUR GREAT PROSPERITY WAS NOT TO LAST ONE EVENING IN EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO
JACOB R MEEKER WHO THEN LIVED ON HIS CLAIM IN THE PUYALLUP VALLEY JOHN V MEEKER MY BROTHER PASSED BY MY CABIN WHEN HE CARRIED THE SACK OF ROOTS ON HIS BACK
WITH THE CAVALRY HE HAS A CLASSMATE AND A FRIEND ALSO WHICH WILL MAKE IT PLEASANT FOR BOTH OF US IN MY LETTERS TO YOU I WILL DISREGARD ARMY ETIQUETTE AND CALL THE LIEUTENANTS BY THEIR RANK OTHERWISE YOU WOULD NOT KNOW OF WHOM I WAS WRITING
THE VINES DID NOT LOOK NATURAL I WALKED DOWN TO THE YARDS A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY AND THERE FIRST SAW THE HOP LOUSE THE YARD WAS LITERALLY ALIVE WITH LICE
THEREBY ADDING TO THEIR PAY AND THESE MEN ARE CALLED STRIKERS THERE ARE FOUR COMPANIES HERE THREE OF INFANTRY AND ONE TROOP OF CAVALRY YOU MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT FAYE IS IN THE INFANTRY
AND BEFORE THE WEEK WAS OUT I BEGAN TO RECEIVE SAMPLES FROM THEM AND LETTERS ASKING WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE HOPS IT APPEARED THAT THE ATTACK OF LICE WAS SIMULTANEOUS IN OREGON WASHINGTON AND BRITISH COLUMBIA
AND HIS LITTLE SON GAVE A SMOTHERED GIGGLE FOR WHICH HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO BED AT ONCE BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL THAT SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN SO DIGNIFIED AND STIFF
I GET THINGS MIXED SOMETIMES MOST GIRLS WOULD A SOLDIER IN UNIFORM WAITED UPON US AT DINNER AND THAT SEEMED SO FUNNY I WANTED TO WATCH HIM ALL THE TIME WHICH DISTRACTED ME
WHILE WE WERE IN THE LARGEST OF THESE SHOPS TEN OR TWELVE INDIANS DASHED UP TO THE DOOR ON THEIR PONIES
YESTERDAY MORNING DIRECTLY AFTER GUARD MOUNTING FAYE PUT ON HIS FULL DRESS UNIFORM EPAULETS BEAUTIFUL SCARLET SASH AND SWORD AND WENT OVER TO THE OFFICE OF THE COMMANDING OFFICER TO REPORT OFFICIALLY
STILL LESS HAD I THOUGHT EVER TO WRITE A BOOK MY FIRST PUBLICATION WAS AN EIGHTY PAGE PAMPHLET DESCRIPTIVE OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY PRINTED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY MY FIRST REAL BOOK HOP CULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES
HE THINKS THIS WAY BECAUSE HAVING GRADUATED AT WEST POINT THIS YEAR HE IS ONLY A SECOND LIEUTENANT JUST NOW AND GENERAL PHILLIPS IS HIS CAPTAIN AND COMPANY COMMANDER
AND SHE MUST KNOW FOR SHE HAS LIVED ON THE FRONTIER A LONG TIME AND HAS SEEN MANY INDIANS OF MANY TRIBES WE WENT TO LAS ANIMAS YESTERDAY MISSUS PHILLIPS MISSUS COLE AND I TO DO A LITTLE SHOPPING
BALLS AND PERCUSSION CAPS AND AS THESE THINGS WERE GIVEN THEM THEY WERE STUFFED DOWN THEIR MUZZLE LOADING RIFLES AND WHAT COULD NOT BE RAMMED DOWN THE BARRELS WAS PUT IN GREASY SKIN BAGS AND HIDDEN UNDER THEIR BLANKETS
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN AS IT WAS STILL QUITE DARK THE DRUMMING BECAME LESS LOUD AND THEN CEASED ALTOGETHER
AND TWO ROOMS AND A VERY LARGE HALL CLOSET ON THE SECOND FLOOR A SOLDIER IS CLEANING THE WINDOWS AND FLOORS AND MAKING THINGS TIDY GENERALLY MANY OF THE MEN LIKE TO COOK AND DO THINGS FOR OFFICERS OF THEIR COMPANY
THAT IT WAS NOT DIGNIFIED IN THE WIFE OF AN OFFICER TO DO SO AND THEN I TOLD HIM THAT AN OFFICER SHOULD TEACH AN ENLISTED MAN NOT TO SNICKER AT HIS WIFE AND NOT TO CALL HER SORR WHICH WAS DISRESPECTFUL I WANTED TO SAY MORE
READY FOR THE BLOOD OF INDIAN OR WHITE MAN THEREFORE HE HAD PERMITTED THEM TO DO ABOUT AS THEY PLEASED WHILE IN THE STORE PARTICULARLY AS WE WERE THERE AND HE SAW THAT WE WERE FRIGHTENED
AND TO INCREASE IN SIZE AND NUMBERS WITH EVERY STEP THEIR COMING WAS SO SUDDEN WE DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO GET OUT OF THEIR WAY AND IT SO HAPPENED THAT MISSUS PHILLIPS AND I WERE IN THEIR LINE OF MARCH
NOT ONE LITTLE THING HAS BEEN STOLEN THEY ARE OF A LIFE THAT HAS PASSED AS HAS PASSED THE BUFFALO AND THE ANTELOPE YES AND THE LOG AND ADOBE QUARTERS FOR THE ARMY ALL FLOWERY DESCRIPTIONS HAVE BEEN OMITTED
SO MUCH NICER THAN ANYTHING WE HAD EXPECTED TO FIND HERE AND ALL SO DIFFERENT FROM THE TERRIBLE PLACES WE HAD SEEN SINCE REACHING THE PLAINS IT WAS APPARENT AT ONCE THAT THIS WAS NOT A PLACE FOR SPOOKS GENERAL PHILLIPS IS NOT A REAL GENERAL
AND THEY WERE DESTROYING AT LEAST THE QUALITY OF THE HOPS I ISSUED A HOP CIRCULAR SENDING IT TO MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED CORRESPONDENTS ALL ALONG THE COAST IN CALIFORNIA OREGON WASHINGTON AND BRITISH COLUMBIA
TO TELL YOU THAT WE ARRIVED HERE SAFELY AND WILL TAKE THE STAGE FOR FORT LYON TO MORROW MORNING AT SIX O'CLOCK
WHERE ONE FEELS THERE IS DANGER OF BEING MURDERED ANY MINUTE NOT ONE WOMAN HAVE I SEEN HERE BUT THERE ARE MEN ANY NUMBER OF DREADFUL LOOKING MEN EACH ONE ARMED WITH BIG PISTOLS AND LEATHER BELTS FULL OF CARTRIDGES
BUT THE HOUSES WE SAW AS WE CAME FROM THE STATION WERE WORSE EVEN THAN THE MEN THEY LOOKED IN THE MOONLIGHT LIKE HUGE CAKES OF CLAY WHERE SPOOKS AND CREEPY THINGS MIGHT BE FOUND THE HOTEL IS MUCH LIKE THE HOUSES
EXCEPT THE WRETCHED RANCH AND STOCKADE WHERE WE GOT FRESH HORSES AND A PERFECTLY UNEATABLE DINNER IT WAS DARK WHEN WE REACHED THE POST SO OF COURSE WE COULD SEE NOTHING THAT NIGHT
AS I STEPPED OUT OF MY OFFICE AND CAST MY EYES TOWARD ONE GROUP OF HOP HOUSES IT STRUCK ME THAT THE HOP FOLIAGE OF A FIELD NEAR BY WAS OFF COLOR DID NOT LOOK NATURAL ONE OF MY CLERKS FROM THE OFFICE SAID THE SAME THING
A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWENTY MILES AND FROM THE SACK I TOOK ROOTS ENOUGH TO PLANT SIX HILLS OF HOPS
I SAW ONE TEST THE SHARP EDGE OF A LONG WICKED LOOKING KNIFE AND THEN IT ALSO DISAPPEARED UNDER HIS BLANKET ALL THIS TIME THE OTHER INDIANS WERE ON THEIR PONIES IN FRONT WATCHING EVERY MOVE THAT WAS BEING MADE AROUND THEM
YOU CAN SEE HOW TREACHEROUS THESE INDIANS ARE AND HOW VERY FAR FROM NOBLE IS THEIR METHOD OF WARFARE THEY ARE SO DISAPPOINTING TOO SO WHOLLY UNLIKE COOPER'S RED MEN
ONLY TWO YEARS AGO THE ENTIRE UTE NATION WAS ON THE WARPATH KILLING EVERY WHITE PERSON THEY CAME ACROSS AND ONE MUST HAVE MUCH FAITH IN INDIANS TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR CHANGE OF HEART
UNDER THE HAMMER AT SHERIFF'S SALE AT THAT TIME I HAD ADVANCED TO MY NEIGHBORS AND OTHERS UPON THEIR HOP CROPS MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH WAS LOST THESE PEOPLE SIMPLY COULD NOT PAY
THESE SOLDIERS ARE NOT NEARLY AS NICE AS ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THEM TO BE WHEN ONE SEES THEM DRESSED UP IN THEIR BLUE UNIFORMS WITH BRIGHT BRASS BUTTONS AND THEY CAN MAKE MISTAKES TOO FOR YESTERDAY WHEN I ASKED THAT SAME MAN A QUESTION
CAME IN THE STORE AND PASSED ON QUICKLY TO THE COUNTER FARTHEST BACK WHERE THE AMMUNITION IS KEPT AS THEY CAME TOWARD US IN THEIR IMPERIOUS WAY NEVER ONCE LOOKING TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT THEY SEEMED LIKE GIANTS
AND DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS WE ARE TO REMAIN WITH GENERAL AND MISSUS PHILLIPS SEVERAL DAYS WHILE OUR OWN HOUSE IS BEING MADE HABITABLE AND IN THE MEANTIME OUR TRUNKS AND BOXES WILL COME ALSO THE COLORED COOK
THEY CAME IN THE GREAT CEDAR LOG CANOES MANNED WITH TWENTY PADDLERS OR MORE FOR THE MOST PART I MANAGED MY INDIAN WORKERS VERY EASILY ONCE I HAD TO TIE UP TWO OF THEM TO A TREE FOR GETTING DRUNK THEIR FRIENDS CAME AND STOLE AWAY THE PRISONERS
FORT LYON COLORADO TERRITORY OCTOBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE WHEN A VERY SMALL GIRL I WAS TOLD MANY WONDERFUL TALES ABOUT A GRAND INDIAN CHIEF
BUT INSTEAD OF THE SMILE AND GRACIOUS ACQUIESCENCE I HAD EXPECTED THERE WAS ANOTHER STRAIGHTENING BACK IN THE CHAIR AND A SILENCE THAT WAS OMINOUS AND CHILLING
AND WHEN THE ONE IN THE LEAD GOT TO US WE WERE PUSHED ASIDE WITH SUCH IMPATIENT FORCE THAT WE BOTH FELL OVER ON THE COUNTER THE OTHERS PASSED ON JUST THE SAME HOWEVER AND IF WE HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR
I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN I WAS TOLD THIS BUT FAYE SAYS THAT HE IS VERY MUCH AFRAID THAT I WILL HAVE CAUSE SOONER OR LATER TO THINK THAT THE GRADE OF CAPTAIN IS QUITE HIGH ENOUGH
AND THEN HAD HIDDEN THEMSELVES ON THE TOP OF A BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE TRAIL THEY KNEW THE CHEYENNES TO BE FOLLOWING AND HAD FIRED UPON THEM AS THEY PASSED BELOW KILLING TWO AND WOUNDING A NUMBER OF OTHERS
I BEGAN TO THINK THAT PERHAPS INDIANS HAD COME UPON US AND CALLED TO FAYE
EVEN FOR GOVERNMENT MULES AND WHEN ONE SAYS LET'S TAKE A SPRINT THE OTHERS ALWAYS AGREE ABOUT THAT THERE IS NEVER THE SLIGHTEST HESITATION
FIRST SEVEN BALES THEN THE FOLLOWING YEAR FIVE HUNDRED BALES THEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED FINALLY OUR ANNUAL SHIPMENTS REACHED ELEVEN THOUSAND BALES A YEAR OR THE EQUIVALENT IN VALUE OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
HE ANSWERED YES SORR THEN I SMILED OF COURSE BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE ENOUGH SENSE TO SEE WHY WHEN I TOLD FAYE ABOUT IT HE LOOKED VEXED AND SAID I MUST NEVER LAUGH AT AN ENLISTED MAN
THAT YOUNG MAN DID NOT KNOW THAT HIS OWN SWARTHY FACE WAS A GREENISH WHITE ALL THE TIME THOSE INDIANS WERE IN THE STORE NOT ONE PENNY DID THEY PAY FOR THE THINGS THEY CARRIED OFF
IN THE CENTER OF WHICH IS A HIGH FLAGSTAFF AND A BIG CANNON THE BUILDINGS ARE VERY LOW AND BROAD AND ARE MADE OF ADOBE A KIND OF CLAY AND MUD MIXED TOGETHER AND THE WALLS ARE VERY THICK
BUT SEEING THAT THERE WERE POSSIBILITIES OF GREAT GAIN I TOOK PAINS TO STUDY HOP CULTURE AND FOUND THAT BY ALLOWING OUR HOPS TO MATURE THOROUGHLY CURING THEM AT A LOW TEMPERATURE AND BALING THEM WHILE HOT
AND AS WE HAVE TO BUY EVERYTHING I SAID AT DINNER LAST EVENING THAT WE MUST HAVE SOME PRECISELY LIKE IT SUPPOSING OF COURSE THAT GENERAL PHILLIPS WOULD FEEL HIGHLY GRATIFIED BECAUSE HIS TASTE WAS ADMIRED
IN AN AWFUL BREAKNECK WAY THE DAY WAS GLORIOUS AND THE ATMOSPHERE SO CLEAR WE COULD SEE MILES AND MILES IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT THERE WAS NOT ONE OBJECT TO BE SEEN ON THE VAST ROLLING PLAINS NOT A TREE NOR A HOUSE
WHERE IT IS LEFT IN A SQUARE BRUSH OF THREE OR FOUR INCHES THEY ARE PERFECTLY MATCHED COAL BLACK ALL OVER EXCEPT THEIR LITTLE NOSES AND ARE QUITE SMALL THEY ARE FULL OF MISCHIEF AND FULL OF WISDOM TOO
AND THAT EACH MAN WAS ANSWERING TO HIS NAME THERE WAS THE SAME PERFORMANCE THIS MORNING AND AT BREAKFAST I ASKED GENERAL PHILLIPS WHY SOLDIERS REQUIRED SUCH A BEATING OF DRUMS AND DEAFENING RACKET GENERALLY TO AWAKEN THEM IN THE MORNING
ALL BUT THE JAPANESE SILK WHICH HAPPENS TO BE IN THAT TRUNK BUT IMAGINE MY MORTIFICATION IN HAVING TO GO WITH FAYE TO HIS REGIMENT WITH ONLY TWO DRESSES AND THEN TO MAKE MY SHORTCOMINGS THE MORE VEXATIOUS
THERE IS NO HIGH WALL AROUND IT AS THERE IS AT FORT TRUMBULL
FAYE HAS JUST BEEN IN TO SAY THAT ONLY ONE OF MY TRUNKS CAN BE TAKEN ON THE STAGE WITH US AND OF COURSE I HAD TO SELECT ONE THAT HAS ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN IT AND CONSEQUENTLY LEAVE MY PRETTY DRESSES HERE TO BE SENT FOR
MY FATHER PLANTED THE REMAINDER
THE COMFORT AND PLENTY WE HAD HOPED AND STRUGGLED FOR WAS ATTAINED NEXT CAME A DEVELOPMENT IN THE FAMILY FORTUNES THAT WE HAD NOT DREAMED OF NEVER HAD WE THOUGHT TO SEE THE MEEKER FAMILY CONDUCTING A BUSINESS THAT WOULD REQUIRE A LONDON OFFICE
THAT AN OFFICER LEFT TO BE SOLD WHEN HE WAS RETIRED LAST SPRING WE GOT ONLY ENOUGH TO MAKE OURSELVES COMFORTABLE DURING THE WINTER FOR IT SEEMS TO BE THE GENERAL BELIEF HERE THAT THESE COMPANIES OF INFANTRY WILL BE ORDERED TO CAMP SUPPLY
THEY MADE ME SHIVER THIS ALL SUDDENLY CEASED AND IMMEDIATELY THERE WERE LIGHTS FLASHING SOME DISTANCE AWAY AND DOZENS OF MEN SEEMED TO BE TALKING ALL AT THE SAME TIME SOME OF THEM SHOUTING HERE HERE
AND RIDDEN FAR AWAY BEFORE ANYONE IN THE SLEEPY TOWN FOUND IT OUT WELL WHEN THOSE INSIDE HAD BEEN GIVEN OR HAD HELPED THEMSELVES TO WHATEVER THEY WANTED OUT THEY ALL MARCHED AGAIN QUICKLY AND SILENTLY
THIS UNEXPECTED PROSPERITY CAME TO US THROUGH THE HOP GROWING INDUSTRY UPON WHICH WE ENTERED WITH ALL OUR FORCE THE BUSINESS WAS WELL STARTED BY THE TIME OF MY FATHER'S DEATH IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE AND IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS FOLLOWING
MISSUS PHILLIPS SAYS THAT INDIANS ARE ALL ALIKE
THEY WERE ALL HIDEOUS WITH STREAKS OF RED OR GREEN PAINT ON THEIR FACES THAT MADE THEM LOOK LIKE FIENDS THEIR HAIR WAS ROPED WITH STRIPS OF BRIGHT COLORED STUFF AND HUNG DOWN ON EACH SIDE OF THEIR SHOULDERS IN FRONT
THERE ARE SEVERAL SMALL STORES IN THE HALF MEXICAN VILLAGE WHERE CURIOUS LITTLE THINGS FROM MEXICO CAN OFTEN BE FOUND IF ONE DOES NOT MIND POKING ABOUT UNDERNEATH THE TRASH AND DIRT THAT IS EVERYWHERE
THE PONY THAT WAS RIDDEN INTO THE STORE DOOR WAS WITHOUT A BRIDLE AND WAS GUIDED BY A LONG STRIP OF BUFFALO SKIN WHICH WAS FASTENED AROUND HIS LOWER JAW BY A SLIPKNOT
AND ONE CAN SEE BY HIS VERY WALK THAT HE EXPECTS THIS TO BE REMEMBERED ALWAYS SO IT IS APPARENT TO ME THAT THE SAFEST THING TO DO IS TO CALL EVERYONE GENERAL THERE SEEM TO BE SO MANY HERE
AND OF COURSE HAD ON LONG TROUSERLIKE LEGGINGS OF SKIN AND MOCCASINS THEY WERE NOT TALL BUT RATHER SHORT AND STOCKY THE ODOR OF THOSE SKINS AND OF THE INDIANS THEMSELVES IN THAT STUFFY LITTLE SHOP
WHICH WAS WHAT I INTENDED THEY SHOULD DO IT WAS IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHTEEN YEARS AFTER MY ARRIVAL FROM ACROSS THE PLAINS THAT I MADE MY FIRST RETURN JOURNEY TO THE STATES I HAD TO GO THROUGH THE MUD TO THE COLUMBIA RIVER
KIT CARSON COLORADO TERRITORY OCTOBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE
THIS WAS SOLD FOR EIGHTY FIVE CENTS A POUND OR A LITTLE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR THE BALE THIS SUM WAS MORE MONEY THAN HAD BEEN RECEIVED BY ANY OF THE SETTLERS IN THE PUYALLUP VALLEY EXCEPT PERHAPS TWO
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE FINDING AND LOSING A FORTUNE OUR YOUTHFUL DREAM OF BECOMING FARMERS WAS NOW REALIZED IN FULLEST MEASURE THE CLEARING WAS GRADUALLY ENLARGED AND ABUNDANT CROPS CAME TO REWARD OUR EFFORTS
THE HOP BUSINESS COULD NOT BE CALLED A VENTURE IT WAS SIMPLY A GROWTH THE CONDITIONS WERE FAVORABLE TO US IN THAT WE COULD PRODUCE HOPS FOR THE WORLD'S MARKET AT THE LOWEST PRICES
WAS PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE I MENTION THIS FACT SIMPLY AS ONE INSTANCE OUT OF THE MANY THAT COULD BE GIVEN OF THE UNEXPECTED LINES OF DEVELOPMENT THAT LIFE IN THE NEW LAND OPENED OUT TO THE PIONEERS
AS IT SEEMED THAT A SIMPLE CONCISE NARRATION OF EVENTS AS THEY ACTUALLY OCCURRED WAS MORE IN KEEPING WITH THE LIFE AND THAT WHICH CAME INTO IT FRANCES M A ROE
THAT THE ENGLISH METHODS DID NOT SUIT OUR DIFFERENT CONDITIONS FOR WHILE WE COULD KILL THE LICE WE HAD TO USE SO MUCH SPRAYING MATERIAL ON THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT IN KILLING THEM WE VIRTUALLY DESTROYED THE HOPS
WHICH BROUGHT AN AVERAGE OF SEVENTY CENTS A POUND MY FIRST HOP HOUSE WAS BUILT IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT A LOG HOUSE IT STILL STANDS IN PIONEER PARK IN PUYALLUP
WE FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE DURING HARVEST TIME MANY OF THESE WERE INDIANS SOME OF WHOM WOULD COME FOR A THOUSAND MILES DOWN THE COAST FROM BRITISH COLUMBIA AND EVEN THE CONFINES OF ALASKA
WHO WERE EVIDENTLY IN AN UGLY MOOD WITH QUANTITIES OF AMMUNITION WITHIN THEIR REACH AND ONLY TWO WHITE MEN TO PROTECT US EVEN THE FEW SMALL WINDOWS HAD IRON BARS ACROSS THEY COULD HAVE KILLED EVERY ONE OF US
I PRESUME THEY WOULD HAVE STEPPED OVER US AND OTHERWISE BEEN OBLIVIOUS TO OUR EXISTENCE THIS WAS MY INTRODUCTION TO AN INDIAN THE NOBLE RED MAN AS SOON AS THEY GOT TO THE COUNTER THEY DEMANDED POWDER
BUT HE DID NOT TELL ME
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO PLANT AN ACRE THE FOLLOWING YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN I PLANTED FOUR ACRES AND FOR TWENTY SIX SUCCESSIVE YEARS THEREAFTER WE ADDED TO THE AREA PLANTED
INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO SELL OUR HOPS AT THE TOP PRICE OF THE MARKET WE SAW OUR PRODUCT FALL TO THE FOOT OF THE LIST THE LAST CROP I RAISED COST ME ELEVEN CENTS A POUND AND SOLD FOR THREE
AND SOME PERSONS ASSERTED OF THE WORLD THE PUBLIC GENERALLY GAVE ME THE CREDIT OF INTRODUCING HOP CULTURE INTO THE NORTHWEST THEREFORE IT SEEMS FITTING TO TELL HERE THE STORY OF THE BEGINNINGS OF AN INDUSTRY
AN OFFICER OR CIVILIAN LIEUTENANT BALDWIN HAS BEEN ON THE FRONTIER MANY YEARS AND IS AN EXPERIENCED HUNTER OF BUFFALO AND ANTELOPE HE SAYS THAT I MUST COMMENCE RIDING HORSEBACK AT ONCE
ARE NOT IMAGINARY PERHAPS THE LETTERS THEMSELVES TELL THAT THEY ARE TRUTHFUL ACCOUNTS OF EXPERIENCES THAT CAME INTO MY OWN LIFE WITH THE ARMY IN THE FAR WEST WHETHER THEY BE ABOUT INDIANS DESPERADOES OR HUNTING
AND WERE GREATLY EXCITED BECAUSE THEY HAD JUST HEARD THERE WAS A SMALL PARTY OF CHEYENNES DOWN THE RIVER TWO OR THREE MILES THE UTES AND CHEYENNES ARE BITTER ENEMIES HE SAID THAT THE UTES WERE VERY CROSS
CALLED RED JACKET BY MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER WHO YOU WILL REMEMBER SAW HIM A NUMBER OF TIMES WHEN SHE ALSO WAS A SMALL GIRL AND SINCE THEN ALMOST ALL MY LIFE
THEY PROCEEDED TO RUN AWAY WITH US WE HAD THE FOUR LITTLE MULES THAT ARE THE SPECIAL PETS OF THE QUARTERMASTER AND ARE KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE GARRISON AS THE SHAVED TAILS BECAUSE THE HAIR ON THEIR TAILS IS KEPT CLOSELY CUT DOWN TO THE VERY TIPS
I SENT MY SECOND SON FRED MEEKER TO LONDON TO LEARN THE ENGLISH METHODS OF FIGHTING THE PEST AND TO IMPORT SOME SPRAYING MACHINERY WE FOUND TO OUR COST HOWEVER IN THE COURSE OF TIME
RUNS ALL AROUND THE POST AND BRINGS WATER TO THE TREES AND LAWNS BUT WATER FOR USE IN THE HOUSES IS BROUGHT UP IN WAGONS FROM THE ARKANSAS RIVER AND IS KEPT IN BARRELS YESTERDAY MORNING OUR FIRST HERE
THERE CERTAINLY COULD BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THE DEVIL SIDE OF IT IT WAS AN AWFUL SITUATION TO BE IN AND ONE TO TERRIFY ANYBODY WE WERE ACTUALLY PRISONERS PENNED IN WITH ALL THOSE SAVAGES
FOR THERE WERE NO SLEEPING CARS THEN AND NO DINERS EITHER ABOUT EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO I HAD COME TO REALIZE THAT THE IMPORTANT MARKET FOR HOPS WAS IN ENGLAND
I DO NOT SEE WHY WE SHOULD FEAR THE DEAD THE OTHER SHOOK HIS HEAD I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW SIR I ALWAYS SAID I DIDN'T BELIEVE BUT SOME THINGS IS MIGHTY QUEER
THIS HERE'S GRINDIN DAY AN I'VE BEEN T MILL OVER ON FALL CREEK THE MATTHEWS MILL HIT IS HIT'LL BE PLUMB DARK GIN I GIT HOME
WHEN THEY REACHED THE BIG LOG HOUSE THAT LOOKS DOWN UPON THE HOLLOW THE BOY WENT AT ONCE WITH HIS AXE TO THE WOODPILE WHILE THE OLDER MAN BUSIED HIMSELF WITH THE MILKING AND OTHER CHORES ABOUT THE BARN
THE MOUNTAINEER RELIGHTED HIS PIPE WHILE YOUNG MATT AND SAMMY SEATED THEMSELVES ON THE STEP AND MISSUS MATTHEWS COMING FROM THE HOUSE JOINED THE GROUP WE'VE JUST NATURALLY GOT TO FIND SOMEBODY TO STAY WITH THEM SHEEP DAD SAID THE SON
OR A SUDDEN WIDE QUESTIONING GAZE THAT REVEALED DEPTH OF SOUL WITHIN BUT WHAT IS THE USE WHEN ALL THIS IS WRITTEN THOSE WHO KNEW SAMMY WILL SAY TIS BUT A POOR PICTURE FOR SHE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN ALL THIS
AND THE EYES WERE HONEST EYES ANYONE MEETING THE PAIR AS THEY WALKED WITH THE LONG SWINGING STRIDE OF THE MOUNTAINEER UP THE STEEP MILL ROAD THAT GRAY AFTERNOON WOULD HAVE TURNED FOR A SECOND LOOK SUCH MEN ARE SELDOM SEEN
THE GRIM FACE OF THE ELDER MATTHEWS SHOWED BOTH PLEASURE AND AMUSEMENT YOU'RE MISTAKEN MISTER THE BOY'S MINE ALRIGHT AN HE'S ALL THAT YOU SAY AN MORE I RECKON
THE STRANGER ALONE KEPT HIS SEAT AND HE NOTED THE AGITATION OF THE OTHERS IN WONDER FOR SOME MOMENTS THE SOUND CONTINUED NOW SOFT AND LOW WITH THE SWEET SADNESS OF THE WIND IN THE PINES
I'LL HEP YOU HUNT HIT IF YOU WANT ME TO MISTER NO SAID THE OTHER I AM NOT LOOKING FOR MINES OF LEAD OR ZINC THERE IS GREATER WEALTH IN THESE HILLS AND FORESTS YOUNG MAN
THE BOY LOOKED AT THE SPEAKER IN WIDE EYED WONDER HE HAD A QUEER FEELING THAT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF A SUPERIOR BEING THROWING ONE THIN LEG OVER THE OLD MARE'S NECK AND WAVING A LONG ARM UP THE HILL AND TO THE LEFT JED DRAWLED
I KNOW THEY'RE TO HOME CAUSE THEY WAS A FIXIN T LEAVE THE MILL WHEN I LEFT BOUT AN HOUR AGO WAS THE RIVER UP MUCH WHEN YOU COME ACROST AS THE NATIVE SPOKE HE WAS STILL PEERING UNEASILY INTO THE WOODS I DID NOT CROSS THE RIVER
THEN CLEAR AND RINGING
HE SEEMED TO BE SHAPING HIS THOUGHT FOR FURTHER SPEECH WHEN AGAIN THE GIRL'S LAUGH RANG CLEAR ALONG THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE RETURNING FROM THE SPRING
HOW FAR IS IT TO THIS MATTHEWS PLACE AND HOW DO I GO JEST FOLLER THIS OLD TRAIL
NOW PLEADINGS AS THOUGH A SOUL IN DARKNESS PRAYED A GLEAM OF LIGHT AGAIN RISING SWELLING EXULTINGLY AS IN GLAD TRIUMPH ONLY TO DIE AWAY ONCE MORE TO THAT MOANING WAIL
I DID WHEN I HAD A HOME I CANNOT SAY THAT I LIVE ANYWHERE NOW OLD MATT LEANED FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR AS IF TO SPEAK AGAIN THEN PAUSED SOMEONE WAS COMING UP THE HILL
A POWERFUL NECK AND WELL POISED HEAD WITH WAVY RED BROWN HAIR AND BLUE EYES THAT HAD IN THEM THE CALM OF SUMMER SKIES OR THE GLINT OF BATTLE STEEL IT WAS A COUNTENANCE FEARLESS AND FRANK BUT GENTLE AND KIND
I I IT DOESN'T MUCH MATTER BOY I SUPPOSE I MUST FIND SOME PLACE WHERE I CAN STAY TO NIGHT DO YOU LIVE NEAR HERE NOPE JED ANSWERED HIT'S A RIGHT SMART PIECE TO WHAR I LIVE
THEN SHE TURNED QUICKLY AWAY AND WITHOUT A WORD WALKED TOWARD THE HOUSE WHILE THE BOY PRETENDING TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH THE PONY'S BRIDLE WATCHED HER AS SHE WENT WHEN THE GIRL WAS GONE THE BIG FELLOW LED THE HORSE AWAY TO THE STABLE
THERE'S MIGHTY STRANGE THINGS STIRRIN ON THIS HERE MOUNTAIN AN IN THE HOLLER DOWN YONDER SAY MISTER DID YOU EVER SEE A HANT THE GENTLEMAN DID NOT UNDERSTAND A HANT A GHOST SOME CALLS EM EXPLAINED JED
YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHILD THEN THE AMUSED SMILE LEFT THE FACE OF THE OLD MOUNTAINEER AS HE ANSWERED SLOWLY THERE WAS SIX BOYS SIR THIS ONE GRANT IS THE YOUNGEST
SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE ALWAYS HUNGRY LAUGHED THE OLDER WOMAN IN RETURN WELL JUST GO ON OUT TO THE BARN AND THE MEN WILL TAKE YOUR HORSE THEN COME RIGHT IN AND I'LL MIGHTY SOON HAVE SOMETHING TO FILL YOU UP OPERATIONS AT THE WOODPILE SUDDENLY CEASED
IN MEMORY OF THAT BEAUTIFUL SUMMER IN THE OZARK HILLS WHEN SO OFTEN WE FOLLOWED THE OLD TRAIL AROUND THE RISE OF MUTTON HOLLOW THE TRAIL THAT IS NOBODY KNOWS HOW OLD AND FROM SAMMY'S LOOKOUT
AND YOUNG MATT WAS FIRST AT THE BARN YARD GATE MISS SAMMY LANE WAS ONE OF THOSE RARE YOUNG WOMEN WHOSE APPEARANCE IS NOT TO BE DESCRIBED ONE CAN OF COURSE PUT IT DOWN THAT SHE WAS TALL BEAUTIFULLY TALL WITH THE TRIMNESS OF A YOUNG PINE
THERE AIN'T NOBODY THERE TO NIGHT AND AS NEAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT THERE'S THREE EWES AND THEIR LAMBS MISSING THERE AIN'T A BIT OF USE IN US TRYING TO DEPEND ON PETE I'LL RIDE OVER ON BEAR CREEK TO MORROW AND SEE IF I CAN GET THAT FELLOW BUCK TOLD US ABOUT
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU WAS A COMIN OVER REPLIED THE WOMAN IN THE DOORWAY I WAS A TELLIN THE MENFOLKS THIS MORNIN THAT YOU HADN'T BEEN NIGH THE WHOLE BLESSED WEEK MISTER MATTHEWS LOWED MAYBE YOU WAS SICK THE OTHER RETURNED WITH A GAY LAUGH
HE WITHDREW TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARN TO RETURN LATER WHEN THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE YOUNG MAN STOOD STROKING THE PONY AS THE LITTLE HORSE MUNCHED HIS GENEROUS FEED OF CORN
A CROW SHOOK THE WET FROM HIS PLUMAGE AND DRIED HIMSELF IN THE WARM LIGHT WHILE FAR BELOW THE MISTS ROLLED AND ON THE SURFACE OF THAT GRAY SEA THE TRAVELER SAW A COMPANY OF BUZZARDS WHEELING AND CIRCLING ABOVE SOME DEAD THING HIDDEN IN ITS DEPTH
IT'S NO USE HONEY SAID MISSUS MATTHEWS BREAKING THE SILENCE IT JUST AIN'T NO USE
AND THE DRIFTING MISTS FROM RIDGE TO RIDGE BECAME A SEA OF GHOSTLY LIGHT IT WAS A WEIRD SCENE ALMOST SUPERNATURAL IN ITS BEAUTY THEN FROM DOWN AT THE SPRING A YOUNG GIRL'S LAUGH ROSE CLEARLY
AND SOON THEY DISTINGUISHED THE STALWART FORM OF THE SON SAMMY COMING FROM THE HOUSE WITH AN EMPTY BUCKET MET THE YOUNG MAN AT THE GATE AND THE TWO WENT TOWARD THE SPRING TOGETHER
CHAPTER ONE THE STRANGER IT WAS CORN PLANTING TIME WHEN THE STRANGER FOLLOWED THE OLD TRAIL INTO THE MUTTON HOLLOW NEIGHBORHOOD ALL DAY A FINE RAIN HAD FALLEN STEADILY
SMALL WONDER OUR LIVES HAVE SO LITTLE OF GOD IN THEM WHEN WE COME IN TOUCH WITH SO LITTLE THAT GOD HAS MADE YOU LIVE IN THE CITY THEN WHEN YOU ARE AT HOME ASKED MISTER MATTHEWS LOOKING CURIOUSLY AT HIS GUEST
RECKON YOU MUST BE FROM KANSAS CITY OR CHICAGO I HEARD TELL THEY'RE MIGHTY BIG TOWNS THE STRANGER'S ONLY ANSWER WAS A CURT GOOD BY AS HIS FORM VANISHED IN THE MIST
OF THE SON YOUNG MATT THE PEOPLE CALLED HIM IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY THAT HE SEEMED MADE OF THE SAME METAL AND CAST IN THE SAME MOLD AS THE FATHER A MIGHTY FRAME SOFTENED YET BY YOUNG MANHOOD'S GRACE
PERHAPS WITH WEARINESS BUT HE CARRIED HIMSELF WITH THE UNCONSCIOUS AIR OF ONE LONG USED TO A POSITION OF CONSPICUOUS POWER AND INFLUENCE AND WHILE HIS WELL KEPT HAIR AND BEARD WERE STRONGLY TOUCHED WITH WHITE
HAIR DARK SHOWING A TOUCH OF GOLD WITH UMBER IN THE SHADOWS A BROW FULL BROAD SET OVER BROWN EYES THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO HIDE BEHIND THEIR FRINGED VEILS BUT LOOKED ALWAYS SQUARE OUT AT YOU WITH A HEALTHY LOOK OF GOOD COMRADESHIP A GLEAM OF MIRTH
RETURNED THE FATHER YOU FIND IT HARD TO GET HELP ON THE RANCH INQUIRED THE STRANGER YES SIR WE DO ANSWERED OLD MATT WE HAD A GOOD NOUGH MAN TILL ABOUT A MONTH AGO
THAT BOY IS THE FINEST SPECIMEN OF MANHOOD I HAVE EVER SEEN AND THE GIRL IS REMARKABLE REMARKABLE SIR YOU WILL PARDON ME I AM SURE BUT I AM AN ENTHUSIASTIC LOVER OF MY KIND AND I CERTAINLY HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A PAIR
YOUNG MATT HAD NOT BEEN CHOPPING LONG WHEN HE HEARD COMING UP THE HILL THE SOUND OF A HORSE'S FEET ON THE OLD TRAIL THE HORSE STOPPED AT THE HOUSE AND A VOICE THAT STIRRED THE BLOOD IN THE YOUNG MAN'S VEINS CALLED
I HAD ONLY TWO A BOY AND A GIRL HE SAID SOFTLY THE GIRL AND HER MOTHER HAVE BEEN GONE THESE TWENTY YEARS THE BOY GREW TO BE A MAN AND NOW HE HAS LEFT ME
THE MAN SAID IN ANSWER TO THE HOST'S QUESTION BUT AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS IN HIS MANNER A TOUCH OF EMBARRASSMENT AND HE CONTINUED QUICKLY AS IF TO PREVENT FURTHER QUESTION YOU HAVE TWO REMARKABLE CHILDREN SIR
IN THE CROWDED CITY CEMETERY THE GROUND IS ALWAYS SHAKEN BY THE TRAMPING OF FUNERAL PROFESSIONS HE BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS FOR SOME TIME THE STRANGER SAT THUS WHILE HIS HOST SPOKE NO WORD
MORE LAUD THAN GILT O'ER DUSTED TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
WHAR WAS YOU TRYIN TO GIT TO MISTER WHERE AM I TRYING TO GET TO AS THE MAN REPEATED JED'S QUESTION HE DREW HIS HAND WEARILY ACROSS HIS BROW
TO SEE THAT THE SHEEP WERE SAFELY FOLDED FOR THE NIGHT AND THE TWO WOMEN WERE BUSY IN THE HOUSE WITH THEIR AFTER SUPPER WORK MISTER MATTHEWS AND HIS GUEST SAT ON THE FRONT PORCH MY NAME IS HOWITT DANIEL HOWITT
A MOMENT HE WATCHED AND HORSE AND RIDER PASSED FROM SIGHT THE CLOUDS WERE DRIFTING FAR AWAY THE WESTERN SKY WAS CLEAR WITH THE SUN STILL ABOVE THE HILLS IN AN OLD TREE THAT LEANED FAR OUT OVER THE VALLEY
IN SILENCE THE MEN ON THE PORCH WATCHED THE MOON AS SHE SLOWLY PUSHED HER WAY UP THROUGH THE LEAFY SCREEN ON THE MOUNTAIN WALL HIGHER AND HIGHER SHE CLIMBED UNTIL HER RAYS FELL INTO THE VALLEY BELOW
I DOUBT IF THERE'S A MAN IN THE HILLS CAN MATCH HIM TO DAY NOT EXCEPTING WASH GIBBS AN HE'S A MIGHTY GOOD BOY TOO BUT THE GIRL IS A DAUGHTER OF A NEIGHBOR AND NO KIN AT ALL INDEED EXCLAIMED THE OTHER
NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCESSFULLY CONTESTED HIS PLACE AS THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE HILLS AND STILL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SIDE THE OLD FOLKS TELL WITH PRIDE TALES OF THE MARVELOUS FEATS OF STRENGTH PERFORMED IN THE DAYS WHEN OLD MATT WAS YOUNG
HE USED TO TAKE ON POWERFUL ABOUT THE BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY AND ALL THE TIME HE WAS A TURNIN IT INTO A HELL FOR THEM THAT HAD TO STAY HERE AFTER HE WAS GONE AS HE SPOKE ANGER AND HATRED GREW DARK IN THE GIANT'S FACE
HE ADDED WITH A SMILE AS HE RAISED HIS ARMS TO ASSIST THE GIRL TO DISMOUNT THE TEASING LIGHT VANISHED AS THE YOUNG WOMAN PLACED HER HANDS ON THE POWERFUL SHOULDERS OF THE GIANT
THEN LIFTING HIS HEAD THE MAN LOOKED AWAY OVER THE RIDGES JUST TOUCHED WITH THE LINGERING LIGHT AND THE VALLEY BELOW WRAPPED IN THE SHADOWY MISTS I CAME AWAY FROM IT ALL BECAUSE THEY SAID I MUST
RODE OUT OF THE GATE AND UP THE TRAIL BEFORE HIM AND WHEN THE MAN REACHED THE OPEN GROUND ON THE MOUNTAIN ABOVE AND ROUNDED THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL HE SAW THE PONY FAR AHEAD LOPING EASILY ALONG THE LITTLE PATH
BOUT THREE MILE I'D SAY DID YOU COME FROM SPRINGFIELD OR SAINT LOUIS MAYBE THE MAN LIFTED HIS SATCHEL FROM THE ROCK AS HE ANSWERED NO I DO NOT LIVE IN EITHER SPRINGFIELD OR SAINT LOUIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE
AND THE BIG MOUNTAINEER SAID IN A LOW TONE MISTER HOWITT YOU'VE GOT EDUCATION IT'S EASY TO SEE THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK SOMEBODY LIKE YOU DO YOU BELIEVE IN HANTS
LOWERING HIS LEG FROM THE HORSE'S NECK AND SETTLING THE MEAL SACK PREPARATORY TO MOVING
THE DEEP VOICE FALTERED PARDON ME SIR FOR SPEAKING OF THIS BUT MY LAD WAS SO LIKE YOUR BOY THERE HE WAS ALL I HAD AND NOW
NOW I AM VERY LONELY SIR THERE IS A BOND OF FELLOWSHIP IN SORROW THAT KNOWS NO CONVENTIONALITIES AS THE TWO MEN SAT IN THE HUSH OF THE COMING NIGHT
UNLESS THAT ONE OVER ON BEAR CREEK WILL COME I RECKON THOUGH HE'LL BE LIKE THE REST HE SAT STARING GLOOMILY INTO THE NIGHT IS THE WORK SO DIFFICULT MISTER HOWITT ASKED
AND WITHERED AND OLD ONE SITS SHAKING BEFORE THE FIRE A GENEROUS LOVING MOUTH RED LIPPED FULL ARCHED WITH THE CORNERS TUCKED IN AND PERFECT TEETH BETWEEN A WOMANLY CHIN AND NOSE WITH CHARACTER ENOUGH TO SAVE THEM FROM BEING PRETTY
YOU CAN'T SEE MUCH OF IT THIS EVENING THOUGH COUNT OF THE MISTS IT'LL FAIR UP BY MORNING I RECKON YOU CAN SEE A LONG WAY FROM HERE OF A CLEAR DAY MISTER YES INDEED
AND RESTING HIS SATCHEL ON A ROCK BESIDE THE NARROW PATH ADDED I AM VERY GLAD TO MEET YOU I FEAR THAT I AM LOST THE VOICE WAS MARVELOUSLY PURE DEEP AND MUSICAL
I WILL GO ON NOW FOR I MUST HURRY OR NIGHT WILL OVERTAKE ME AND I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THE PATH
HE LOOKED SEARCHINGLY INTO THE MISTS ON EVERY HAND AND PAUSED FREQUENTLY AS IF QUESTIONING THE PROPER COURSE SUDDENLY HE STEPPED QUICKLY FORWARD
NO I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THESE MOUNTAINS BEFORE I LOWED MAYBE YOU'D HEARD TELL O JIM OR SAMMY THERE'S THEM THAT LOWS JIM KNOWS A HEAP MORE BOUT OLD MAN DEWEY'S CAVE THAN HE LETS ON HIS PLACE BEIN SO NIGH
I AM ALRIGHT ANSWERED THE VOICE I'VE COME OVER T STOP WITH YOU TO NIGHT DAD'S AWAY AGAIN MANDY FORD STAID WITH ME LAST NIGHT BUT SHE HAD TO GO HOME THIS EVENIN THE BIG FELLOW AT THE WOODPILE DROVE HIS AXE DEEPER INTO THE LOG
AND BECAUSE I WAS HUNGRY FOR THIS HE WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD THE GLOWING SKY AND THE FOREST CLAD HILLS THIS IS GOOD FOR ME IT SOMEHOW SEEMS TO HELP ME KNOW HOW BIG GOD IS ONE COULD FIND PEACE HERE
AN WOULD BE TOO IF FOLKS CARED HALF AS MUCH BOUT BREEDING FOLKS AS THEY DO BOUT RAISING HOGS AN HORSES MISTER MATTHEWS WAS A GIANT FULLY SIX FEET FOUR INCHES IN HEIGHT
AND THE STRANGER SAW THE BIG HANDS CLENCH AND THE HUGE FRAME GROW TENSE WITH PASSION THEN AS IF STRIVING TO BE NOT UNGRACIOUS THE WOODSMAN SAID IN A SOMEWHAT SOFTER TONE
HIS EAR HAD CAUGHT THE SHARP RING OF A HORSE'S SHOE ON A FLINT ROCK SOMEWHERE IN THE MISTS ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE ABOVE IT WAS JED HOLLAND COMING DOWN THE TRAIL WITH A WEEK'S SUPPLY OF CORN MEAL IN A SACK ACROSS HIS HORSE'S BACK
THEIR FACES TURNED TOWARD THE SOMBER GROUP OF TREES THEY FELT STRONGLY DRAWN TO ONE ANOTHER THE MOUNTAINEER'S COMPANION SPOKE AGAIN HALF TO HIMSELF I WISH THAT MY DEAR ONES HAD A RESTING PLACE LIKE THAT
SO PASSIONATELY SWEET THE VOICE IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE MUSIC SHOULD COME FROM HUMAN LIPS IT WAS MORE AS THOUGH SOME GENIE OF THE FOREST CLAD HILLS WANDERED THROUGH THE MISTS SINGING AS HE WENT WITH THE JOY OF HIS POSSESSIONS
MUST BE FROM NEW YORK SURE SLOWLY THE OLD MAN TOILED UP THE MOUNTAIN UP FROM THE MISTS OF THE LOWER GROUND TO THE RIDGE ABOVE
AND LIKE THE BROWN EYES BETRAYED THE REAL STRENGTH OF THE MAN DENIED BY HIS GRAY HAIR AND BENT FORM THE TONES WERE AS DIFFERENT FROM THE HIGH KEYED SLURRING SPEECH OF THE BACKWOODS AS THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF WAS UNLIKE ANY MAN JED HAD EVER MET
THE OTHERS LIE OVER THERE HE POINTED WITH HIS PIPE TO WHERE A CLUMP OF PINES NOT FAR FROM THE HOUSE SHOWED DARK AND TALL AGAINST THE LAST RED GLOW IN THE SKY THE STRANGER GLANCED AT THE BIG MAN'S FACE IN QUICK SYMPATHY
HE TURNED AND LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY UP THE TRAIL
I WAS NEVER SICK A MINUTE IN MY LIFE THAT ANYBODY EVER HEARD TELL I'M POWERFUL HUNGRY THOUGH YOU'D BETTER PUT IN ANOTHER PAN OF CORN BREAD SHE TURNED HER PONY'S HEAD TOWARD THE BARN
THE STRANGER WHOM JED HAD MET ON THE OLD TRAIL STOOD AT THE GATE CHAPTER THREE THE VOICE FROM OUT THE MISTS WHILE YOUNG MATT WAS GONE TO THE CORRAL IN THE VALLEY
AND AS SHE FELT THE PLAY OF THE SWELLING MUSCLES THAT SWUNG HER TO THE GROUND SO EASILY HER FACE FLUSHED WITH ADMIRATION FOR THE FRACTION OF A MINUTE SHE STOOD FACING HIM HER HANDS STILL ON HIS ARMS HER LIPS PARTED AS IF TO SPEAK
AS THE FIGURE OF THE TRAVELER EMERGED FROM THE MISTS THE NATIVE CHECKED HIS HORSE TO GREET THE NEWCOMER WITH THE CUSTOMARY SALUTATION OF THE BACKWOODS HOWDY THE MAN RETURNED JED'S GREETING CORDIALLY
HIT SURE DO IKE GREETING THE GIRL THE YOUNG MAN OPENED THE GATE FOR HER TO PASS I'VE BEEN A LOOKIN FOR YOU OVER SAID SAMMY A TEASING LIGHT IN HER EYES DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT MANDY WAS STOPPIN WITH ME
AUNT MOLLIE WAS WEEPING SUDDENLY SAMMY SPRANG FROM THE STEPS AND RUNNING DOWN THE WALK TO THE GATE SENT A CLEAR PIERCING CALL OVER THE VALLEY
DIFFICULT NO THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO DO BUT TENDIN TO THE SHEEP THE MAN HAS TO STAY AT THE RANCH OF NIGHTS THOUGH MISTER HOWITT WAS WONDERING WHAT STAYING AT THE RANCH NIGHTS COULD HAVE TO DO WITH THE DIFFICULTY
DEEP BOSOMED WITH LIMBS FULL ROUNDED FAIRLY TINGLING WITH THE LIFE AND STRENGTH OF PERFECT WOMANHOOD AND IT MAY BE SAID THAT HER FACE WAS A FACE TO GO WITH ONE THROUGH THE YEARS AND TO LIVE STILL IN ONE'S DREAMS WHEN THE SAP OF LIFE IS GONE
DOWN YONDER'S MUTTON HOLLER THEN TURNING A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT AND POINTING INTO THE MIST WITH THE OTHER HAND HE CONTINUED
YOU KNOW THE MATTHEWS'S I RECKON THERE WAS A HINT OF IMPATIENCE NOW IN THE DEEP VOICE
THE BROWN CLEAR LIGHTED EYES THAT LOOKED FROM UNDER THEIR SHAGGY BROWS TOLD OF AN INTELLECT UNCLOUDED BY THE SHADOWS OF MANY YEARS IT WAS A FACE MARKED DEEPLY BY PRIDE PRIDE OF BIRTH OF INTELLECT
YONDER THAR BY THAT BIG ROCK THE STRANGER LOOKING
SURELY SIR ONE COULD FIND IT HERE PEACE AND STRENGTH THE MOUNTAINEER PUFFED HARD AT HIS PIPE FOR A WHILE THEN SAID GRUFFLY SEEMS THAT WAY MISTER TO THEM THAT DON'T KNOW
FLITTING FROM TREE TO TREE BUT EVEN AS HE LOOKED IT VANISHED AMONG THE HUNDREDS OF FANTASTIC SHAPES IN THE GRAY FOREST WHAT IS IT HE ASKED THE NATIVE SHOOK HIS HEAD DURNED IF I KNOW MISTER YOU CAN'T TELL
THE MAN FROM THE CITY SAW THAT HIS BIG HOST WAS TERRIBLY IN EARNEST AND ANSWERED QUIETLY NO I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH THINGS MISTER MATTHEWS BUT IF IT SHOULD BE TRUE
AND AS HE CLIMBED UNSEEN BY HIM A SHADOWY FORM FLITTED FROM TREE TO TREE IN THE DIM DRIPPING FOREST AS THE STRANGER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE LANE CABIN A YOUNG WOMAN ON A BROWN PONY
DO YOU THINK THIS MISTER LANE WOULD ENTERTAIN ME JED PUSHED A HAND UP UNDER HIS TATTERED OLD HAT AND SCRATCHED AWHILE BEFORE HE ANSWERED
CAUSE THEY'RE SO DAD BURNED ROUGH LEMME HEP YOU MISTER I'D LIKE MIGHTY WELL T GIT SOME CLOTHES LIKE THEM I DO NOT SPEAK OF GOLD MY BOY THE STRANGER ANSWERED KINDLY BUT I MUST NOT KEEP YOU LONGER OR DARKNESS WILL OVERTAKE US
STAY ANYWHERE WHAR DO YOU LIVE WHEN YOU'RE TO HOME AGAIN JED'S QUESTION WAS IGNORED YOU THINK THEN THAT MISTER MATTHEWS WILL KEEP ME LAW YES THEY'LL TAKE ANYBODY IN
BUT MANY'S THE TIME I'VE WISHED TO GOD I'D NEVER SEEN THESE HERE OZARKS I USED TO FEEL LIKE YOU DO BUT I CAN'T NO MORE THEY MIND ME NOW OF HIM THAT BLACKENED MY LIFE
WILL MISTER MATTHEWS KEEP ME DO YOU THINK JED WHO WAS STILL LOOKING UP THE TRAIL SUDDENLY LEANED FORWARD AND POINTING INTO THE TIMBER TO THE LEFT OF THE PATH SAID IN AN EXCITING WHISPER LOOK AT THAT MISTER
VERY TRUE VERY TRUE INDEED HE MUSED THEN HE TURNED TO JED AND ASKED IS THERE A HOUSE NEAR HERE JIM LANE LIVES UP THE TRAIL BOUT HALF A QUARTER EVER HEAR TELL O JIM
BY HIS DRESS THE MAN WAS FROM THE WORLD BEYOND THE RIDGES AND HIS CAREFULLY TAILORED CLOTHING LOOKED STRANGELY OUT OF PLACE IN THE MOUNTAIN WILDERNESS HIS FORM STOOPED A LITTLE IN THE SHOULDERS
SEEMING AT LAST TO LOSE ITSELF IN THE MISTS SLOWLY OLD MATT SANK BACK INTO HIS SEAT AND THE STRANGER HEARD HIM MUTTER POOR BOY POOR BOY
MISSUS MATTHEWS CAME CLOSE TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AND PLACED HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER AS HE HALF ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR HIS PIPE FALLEN TO THE FLOOR YOUNG MATT ROSE TO HIS FEET AND MOVED CLOSER TO THE GIRL WHO WAS ALSO STANDING
WEARILY THE MAN FOLLOWED THE OLD TRAIL TOWARD THE MATTHEWS PLACE AND ALWAYS AS HE WENT IN THE EDGE OF THE GLOOMY FOREST
AGAIN THE GIRL CALLED AND YET AGAIN
OF CULTURE THE FACE OF A SCHOLAR AND POET BUT IT WAS MORE IT WAS THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE FAIRLY STAGGERING UNDER A BURDEN OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND GRIEF AS THE STRANGER WALKED
IT'S ALRIGHT DAD THEN LET'S GO TO THE HOUSE MOTHER CALLED SUPPER SOME TIME AGO JUST AS THE LITTLE COMPANY WERE SEATING THEMSELVES AT THE TABLE THE DOG IN THE YARD BARKED LOUDLY YOUNG MATT WENT TO THE DOOR
THE ELDER MAN LAID HIS HAND ON THE BROAD SHOULDER OF THE LAD SO LIKE HIM AND LOOKED FULL INTO THE CLEAR EYES IS IT ALRIGHT SON HE ASKED GRUFFLY AND THE BOY ANSWERED AS HE RETURNED HIS FATHER'S LOOK
WHEN UP FROM THE VALLEY BELOW FROM OUT THE DARKNESS AND THE MISTS CAME A STRANGE SOUND A SOUND AS IF SOMEONE WERE SINGING A SONG WITHOUT WORDS SO WILD AND WEIRD WAS THE MELODY
WHAT MIGHT YER NAME BE MISTER THE OTHER LOOKING BACK OVER THE WAY HE HAD COME SEEMED NOT TO HEAR JED'S QUESTION AND THE NATIVE CONTINUED MINE'S HOLLAND PAP AN MAM THEY COME FROM TENNESSEE
PREACHIN BILL SAYS
BUD WILSON HE SURE SEED OLD MATT'S THE OTHER INTERRUPTED REALLY YOUNG MAN I MUST GO IT IS ALREADY LATE AND YOU KNOW I HAVE YET TO FIND A PLACE TO STAY FOR THE NIGHT LAW THAT'S ALRIGHT MISTER REPLIED JED
WITH BIG BONES BROAD SHOULDERS AND MIGHTY MUSCLES AT LOG ROLLINGS AND CHOPPING BEES IN THE FIELD OR AT THE MILL OR IN ANY OF THE GAMES IN WHICH THE BACKWOODSMAN TRIES HIS STRENGTH
SHE'S BEEN A DYIN TO SEE YOU I'M MIGHTY SORRY HE REPLIED FASTENING THE GATE AND COMING TO THE PONY'S SIDE WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME BEFORE I RECKON SHE'LL GET OVER IT ALRIGHT THOUGH
WHERE HE CROSSED HIS ARMS UPON THE SADDLE AND HID HIS FACE FROM THE LIGHT MISTER MATTHEWS COMING QUIETLY TO THE DOOR A FEW MINUTES LATER SAW THE BOY STANDING THERE AND THE RUGGED FACE OF THE BIG MOUNTAINEER SOFTENED AT THE SIGHT QUIETLY
AND THE MISTS HUNG HEAVY OVER THE VALLEY THE LOWER HILLS WERE WRAPPED AS IN A WINDING SHEET DANK AND COLD THE TREES WERE DRIPPING WITH MOISTURE THE STRANGER LOOKED TIRED AND WET
NECK LONG AND MUSCULAR ELEGANTLY ARCHED AND FREE FROM THROATINESS SHOULDERS OBLIQUE AND MUSCULAR CHEST DEEP AND CAPACIOUS BACK
AND YET A KIND OF COMMERCE CLINGS TO THE SPOT A PILGRIM WANTING A PIN OR A PISTOL A CUCUMBER OR A CAMEL A HOUSE OR A HORSE A LOAN OR A LENTIL A DATE OR A DRAGOMAN A MELON OR A MAN A DOVE OR A DONKEY
HE BECOMES AWARE OF A WATERING OF THE MOUTH AND A GNAWING SENSATION AT THE STOMACH WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IT MEANS THAT THE MENTAL IMPRESSION MADE UPON HIM BY THE WELCOME AND APPETIZING SPECTACLE HAS CAUSED A SECRETION OF SALIVA AND OF GASTRIC JUICE
SUCH A CONDITION I SAY IS ALWAYS SUBJECTIVE IT IS INDEPENDENT OF PASSES OR GESTURES IT HAS NO RELATION TO ANY FLUID EMANATING FROM THE OPERATOR IT HAS NO RELATION TO HIS WILL
AND AFTER WARNING ALL TO BE READY DISCHARGES A PISTOL UPON WHICH EACH ATTENDANT SWINGS HIS DOG AS FAR FORWARD AS HE CAN POSSIBLY THROW HIM BUT ALWAYS MAKING SURE THAT HE ALIGHTS ON HIS FEET
WHILE THE AREA OUTSIDE HAD BECOME A RECOGNIZED MARKET PLACE IN SOLOMON'S DAY THERE WAS GREAT TRAFFIC AT THE LOCALITY SHARED IN BY TRADERS FROM EGYPT AND THE RICH DEALERS FROM TYRE AND SIDON NEARLY THREE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE PASSED
HE WILL SAY THAT HE NOW SEES ONE STROKE AND POINT IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH LIES THE IMAGE SEEN THROUGH THE PRISM ANOTHER EXPERIMENT PROVES THAT HE MUST SEE IT IN ORDER TO IGNORE IT MAKE A RED CROSS
WE MAY INTRODUCE A VOLATILE SUBSTANCE SUCH AS CHLOROFORM AND ITS FIRST EFFECT WILL BE TO ABOLISH CONSCIOUSNESS AND INDUCE PROFOUND SLUMBER AND A BLESSED INSENSIBILITY TO PAIN THE LIKE EFFECTS WILL FOLLOW MORE SLOWLY UPON THE ABSORPTION OF A DRUG
THIS SPORT HAS BEEN MAINLY CONFINED TO THE WORKING CLASSES THE COLLIERS OF LANCASHIRE YORKSHIRE DURHAM AND NORTHUMBERLAND BEING PARTICULARLY DEVOTED TO IT AS A RULE THE CONTESTS ARE HANDICAPS
TO WHICH WEIGHT ALONE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE ENTITLED THEM EACH DOG IS TAKEN TO ITS STIPULATED MARK ACCORDING TO THE HANDICAP AND THERE LAID HOLD OF BY THE NAPE OF THE NECK AND HIND QUARTERS THE REAL STARTER STANDS BEHIND THE LOT
OR PERHAPS ONLY A SHUDDERING AND SKIN CONTRACTION KNOWN AS GOOSE SKIN THE IRRITATION OF THE NERVE END IN THE SKIN HAS CARRIED A MESSAGE TO THE INVOLUNTARY OR VOLUNTARY GANGLIA OF THE BRAIN WHICH HAS RESPONDED BY REFLECTING BACK AGAIN NERVE IMPULSES
INVISIBLE TO THE HYPNOTIC SUBJECT ON A SHEET OF WHITE PAPER AND YET CAUSE HIM TO LOOK FIXEDLY AT A DOT ON THE PAPER ON OR NEAR THE RED CROSS HE WILLS ON TRANSFERRING HIS EYE TO THE BLANK SHEET SEE A BLUISH GREEN AFTER IMAGE OF THE CROSS
THIS GLANCE AT THE SELLERS AND THEIR COMMODITIES THE READER HAS NEED TO GIVE ATTENTION IN THE NEXT PLACE TO VISITORS AND BUYERS FOR WHICH THE BEST STUDIES WILL BE FOUND OUTSIDE THE GATES WHERE THE SPECTACLE IS QUITE AS VARIED AND ANIMATED INDEED IT MAY BE MORE SO
BUT WHICH IT WOULD TAKE TOO MUCH TIME TO DEVELOP FULLY AT PRESENT MOST PEOPLE KNOW SOMETHING OF WHAT IS MEANT BY REFLEX ACTION THE NERVES WHICH PASS FROM THE VARIOUS ORGANS TO THE BRAIN
HERE THEN IT IS SEEN THAT WE HAVE A MECHANISM IN THE BODY KNOWN TO PHYSIOLOGISTS AS THE IDEO MOTOR OR SENSORY MOTOR SYSTEM OF NERVES WHICH CAN PRODUCE WITHOUT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND AUTOMATICALLY A SERIES OF MUSCULAR CONTRACTIONS
I WILL TAKE THE EXCELLENT ILLUSTRATION QUOTED BY DOCTOR B W CARPENTER IN HIS OLD TIME BUT VALUABLE BOOK ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BRAIN WHEN A HUNGRY MAN SEES FOOD OR WHEN LET US SAY A HUNGRY BOY LOOKS INTO A COOKSHOP
A LITTLE MIXING WITH THE THRONG HOWEVER A LITTLE FAMILIARITY WITH THE BUSINESS GOING ON WILL MAKE ANALYSIS POSSIBLE HERE STANDS A DONKEY DOZING UNDER PANNIERS FULL OF LENTILS BEANS ONIONS AND CUCUMBERS
GROANS AND OCCASIONALLY SHOWS HIS TEETH BUT THE MAN PACES INDIFFERENTLY TO AND FRO HOLDING THE DRIVING STRAP AND ALL THE TIME ADVERTISING HIS FRUITS FRESH FROM THE ORCHARDS OF THE KEDRON GRAPES DATES FIGS APPLES AND POMEGRANATES
IN ADDITION TO THIS PRIVATE TRIALS ARE NECESSARY IN THE PRESENCE OF SOMEONE WHO IS ACCUSTOMED TO TIMING RACES BY THE AID OF A STOP WATCH A BY NO MEANS EASY TASK CONSIDERING THAT A SLIGHT PARTICLE OF A SECOND
IN RATHER UNDER TWELVE SECONDS IN ORDER TO INDUCE EACH DOG TO DO ITS BEST THE OWNER OR MORE PROBABLY THE TRAINER STANDS BEYOND THE WINNING POST AND FRANTICALLY WAVES A TOWEL OR VERY STOUT RAG ACCOMPANIED BY A BABEL OF NOISE
ARE SIMILAR TO AND HAVE MUCH IN COMMON WITH MESMERIC SLEEP HYPNOTISM OR ELECTRO BIOLOGY WE HAVE ALREADY I HOPE SUCCEEDED IN ELIMINATING FROM OUR MINDS THE FALSE THEORY THE THEORY THAT IS TO SAY EXPERIMENTALLY PROVED TO BE FALSE
BETTER OPPORTUNITY WILL NOT OFFER TO GET SIGHT OF THE POPULACE WHO WILL AFTERWHILE GO FORWARD IN A MOOD VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH NOW POSSESSES THEM THE SCENE IS AT FIRST ONE OF UTTER CONFUSION CONFUSION OF ACTION SOUNDS COLORS AND THINGS
WHICH IS ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF ITS ACTIVITY DEPEND UPON THE HEALTHY REGULARITY OF THE QUANTITY OF BLOOD PASSING THROUGH ALL ITS PARTS AND UPON THE HEALTHY QUALITY OF THE BLOOD SO CIRCULATING IF WE PRESS UPON THE CAROTID ARTERIES WHICH PASS UP THROUGH THE NECK
OR ABEYANCE OF FUNCTION IN THE WILL CENTERS AND UPPER CONVOLUTIONS OF THE BRAIN AS IN ITS OTHER CENTERS OF LOCALIZATION HERE THEN WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A CLUE TO THE PHENOMENA PHENOMENA WHICH AS I HAVE POINTED OUT
BROUGHT FRESH FROM THE GARDENS AND TERRACES OF GALILEE WHEN NOT ENGAGED IN SERVING CUSTOMERS THE MASTER IN A VOICE WHICH ONLY THE INITIATED CAN UNDERSTAND CRIES HIS STOCK NOTHING CAN BE SIMPLER THAN HIS COSTUME
CONVEY WITH GREAT RAPIDITY MESSAGES TO ITS VARIOUS PARTS WHICH ARE ANSWERED BY REFLECTED WAVES OF IMPULSE IF THE SOLES OF THE FEET BE TICKLED CONTRACTION OF THE TOES OR INVOLUNTARY LAUGHTER WILL BE EXCITED
THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY ARE TRAVELLING MAKES THIS MOVEMENT NECESSARY IN MANY CASES TO ENABLE THE DOG TO AVOID ACCIDENT PARTICULARLY WHERE THE SPACE BEYOND THE WINNING MARK IS LIMITED FOR RACING PURPOSES THERE IS A WIDE MARGIN OF SIZE ALLOWED TO THE DOGS
WHEN MOLESTED HE WILL SNAP AT HIS OPPONENT WITH SUCH CELERITY AS TO TAKE EVEN THE MOST WATCHFUL BY SURPRISE WHILE HIS STRENGTH OF JAW COMBINED WITH ITS COMPARATIVELY GREAT LENGTH ENABLES HIM TO INFLICT SEVERE PUNISHMENT AT THE FIRST GRAB
HERE AGAIN THE CONSCIOUSNESS MAY BE ONLY PARTIALLY AFFECTED AND THE PERSON IN WHOM SLEEP COMA OR HALLUCINATION IS PRODUCED WHETHER BY PHYSICAL MEANS OR BY THE INFLUENCE OF SUGGESTION MAY REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE WILL OF OTHERS AND INCAPABLE OF EXERCISING HIS OWN VOLITION
HAS THE CREDIT FOR FIRST INTRODUCING CLASSES FOR WHIPPETS INTO THE PRIZE RING PREVIOUS TO THIS IT HAD NOT LONG BEEN GENERALLY RECOGNISED AS A DISTINCT BREED
WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE POINT AT WHICH IT WILL BE PLAIN THAT THE CONDITION PRODUCED IN THESE CASES AND KNOWN UNDER A VARIED JARGON INVENTED EITHER TO CONCEAL IGNORANCE TO EXPRESS HYPOTHESES OR TO MASK THE DESIGN OF IMPRESSING THE IMAGINATION
WITH LONG SHAGGY TUFTS OF FOX COLORED HAIR UNDER ITS THROAT NECK AND BODY AND A LOAD OF BOXES AND BASKETS CURIOUSLY ARRANGED UPON AN ENORMOUS SADDLE THE OWNER IS AN EGYPTIAN SMALL LITHE AND OF A COMPLEXION
THE FIRST HOUR BEING THE FIRST AFTER SUNRISE SO TO BE PRECISE THE MARKET AT THE JOPPA GATE DURING THE FIRST HOUR OF THE DAY STATED WAS IN FULL SESSION AND VERY LIVELY THE MASSIVE VALVES HAD BEEN WIDE OPEN SINCE DAWN
AS THE BLOOD IS PRESSED OUT BY THE CONTRACTION OF THE ARTERIES SO ALSO THE CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE DIRECTING WILL MAY BE ABOLISHED BY ALTERING THE QUALITY OF THE BLOOD PASSING THROUGH THE CONVOLUTIONS OF THE BRAIN
COLOUR IN THE WHIPPET IS ABSOLUTELY OF NO IMPORTANCE TO A GOOD JUDGE THOUGH POSSIBLY WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE PEACH FAWN IS THE FAVOURITE AMONG AMATEUR FANCIERS RED FAWNS BLUE OR SLATE COLOURED BLACK BRINDLED OF VARIOUS SHADES
REPORTS THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS MAKE A STROKE ON A PAPER OR BLACKBOARD AND TELL THE SUBJECT IT IS NOT THERE AND HE WILL SEE NOTHING BUT THE CLEAN PAPER OR BOARD NEXT HE NOT LOOKING
THE AREA OUTSIDE OF THEM IS ONE OF THE NOTABLE PLACES OF THE CITY LONG BEFORE DAVID COVETED ZION THERE WAS A CITADEL THERE
FOR EVERY POUND DIFFERENCE IN WEIGHT
OR IN WHAT ORDER THEY ARE ARRANGED SIMILARLY IF THE ORIGINAL SINGLE LINE TO WHICH HE IS BLIND BE DOUBLED BY A PRISM OF SIXTEEN DEGREES PLACED BEFORE ONE OF HIS EYES BOTH BEING KEPT OPEN
WITHOUT VARIATION FOR SEX BEING CONSIDERED ALTOGETHER TOO HEAVY APPEARANCES ARE SOMETIMES DECEPTIVE BUT THESE DOGS ARE RARELY WEIGHED FOR EXHIBITION PURPOSES
IT IS A REMARKABLE BUT WELL RECOGNISED FACT THAT BITCHES ARE FASTER THAN DOGS AND IN CONSEQUENCE THE TERMS UPON WHICH THEY ARE HANDICAPPED ARE VARIED THE GENERAL CUSTOM IS TO ALLOW A DOG
LOOSELY GATHERED AT THE WAIST AND A VEIL OR WIMPLE BROAD ENOUGH AFTER COVERING THE HEAD TO WRAP THE SHOULDERS THEIR MERCHANDISE IS CONTAINED IN A NUMBER OF EARTHEN JARS SUCH AS ARE STILL USED IN THE EAST FOR BRINGING WATER FROM THE WELLS
AND REMEMBER THAT THE COATS OF THE ARTERIES ARE MUSCULAR AND CONTRACTILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXTERNAL STIMULI ACTING WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OR WHEN THE CONSCIOUSNESS IS IN ABEYANCE I WILL GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS WHICH COMPLETES THE CHAIN OF PHENOMENA
AND FULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE POWER THERE IS IN THE LUSTRE OF A RIBBON AND THE INCISIVE GLEAM OF GOLD WHETHER IN BRACELET OR NECKLACE OR IN RINGS FOR THE FINGER OR THE NOSE AND WITH PEDDLERS OF HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS AND WITH DEALERS IN WEARING APPAREL
BUT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH HE WAS BRED IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT FOR WHICH HIS LARGER PROTOTYPE IS STILL USED THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT RABBITS WERE COURSED BY WHIPPETS AND HARES BY GREYHOUNDS
AND WITH HUCKSTERS OF ALL ARTICLES FANCIFUL AS WELL AS OF NEED HITHER AND THITHER TUGGING AT HALTERS AND ROPES NOW SCREAMING NOW COAXING TOIL THE VENDERS OF ANIMALS
THIS IS SO TO SPEAK A PROCESS OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION AND I HAVE OFTEN PRACTICED IT WHEN GOING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE WHEN IN THE MIDST OF A BUSY PRACTICE AND I SOMETIMES HAVE AMUSED MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY BY EXERCISING THIS FACULTY
THE TRAINED EYE OF THE JUDGE BEING SUFFICIENT GUIDE TO THE SIZE OF THE COMPETITORS ACCORDING TO HIS PARTIALITY FOR MIDDLE SIZE BIG OR LITTLE ANIMALS THE SOUTH DURHAM AND YORKSHIRE SHOW AT DARLINGTON
HAS ONLY TO INQUIRE FOR THE ARTICLE AT THE JOPPA GATE SOMETIMES THE SCENE IS QUITE ANIMATED AND THEN IT SUGGESTS WHAT A PLACE THE OLD MARKET MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE DAYS OF HEROD THE BUILDER AND TO THAT PERIOD AND THAT MARKET THE READER IS NOW TO BE TRANSFERRED
DOVES DUCKS AND FREQUENTLY THE SINGING BULBUL OR NIGHTINGALE MOST FREQUENTLY PIGEONS AND BUYERS RECEIVING THEM FROM THE NETS SELDOM FAIL TO THINK OF THE PERILOUS LIFE OF THE CATCHERS BOLD CLIMBERS OF THE CLIFFS
TO ALLOW A DOG IN TRAINING TO GAMBOL ABOUT EITHER ON THE ROADS OR IN THE FIELDS INDEED ALL DOGS WHICH ARE UNDERGOING PREPARATION FOR A RACE ARE PRACTICALLY DEPRIVED OF THEIR FREEDOM IN LIEU OF WHICH THEY ARE WALKED ALONG HARD ROADS SECURED BY A LEAD
IS A COMPLICATED ORGAN MADE UP INTERNALLY OF NERVE MASSES OR GANGLIA OF WHICH THE CENTRAL AND UNDERLYING MASSES ARE CONNECTED WITH THE AUTOMATIC FUNCTIONS AND INVOLUNTARY ACTIONS OF THE BODY SUCH AS THE ACTION OF THE HEART LUNGS STOMACH BOWELS ET CETERA
GRAPES OF EN GEDI WHEN A CUSTOMER HALTS ONE OF THEM ROUND COMES THE BOTTLE AND UPON LIFTING THE THUMB FROM THE NOZZLE OUT INTO THE READY CUP GUSHES THE DEEP RED BLOOD OF THE LUSCIOUS BERRY SCARCELY LESS BLATANT ARE THE DEALERS IN BIRDS
BECOMES WHITE AND ALMOST BLOODLESS IT IS IN THESE UPPER CONVOLUTIONS OF THE BRAIN AS WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE WILL AND THE DIRECTING POWER ARE RESIDENT SO THAT IN SLEEP THE WILL IS ABOLISHED AND CONSCIOUSNESS FADES GRADUALLY AWAY
FOR THERE ARE SUPERADDED THE EFFECTS OF TENT BOOTH AND SOOK GREATER SPACE LARGER CROWD
IT WAS PROBABLY OWING TO THIS HABIT WHICH IS COMMON TO ALL WHIPPETS THAT THEY WERE ORIGINALLY KNOWN AS SNAP DOGS THE WHIPPET EXISTED AS A SEPARATE BREED LONG BEFORE DOG SHOWS WERE THOUGHT OF
THAT IS TO SAY THE BRAIN HAS THROUGH THE IDEO MOTOR SET OF NERVES SENT A MESSAGE WHICH HAS DILATED THE VESSELS AROUND THE SALIVARY AND GASTRIC GLANDS INCREASED THE FLOW OF BLOOD THROUGH THEM AND QUICKENED THEIR SECRETION HERE WE HAVE THEN
THEIR ENTREATIES ARE USUALLY LOST IN THE GENERAL UPROAR AND THEY FARE ILLY AGAINST THE MANY COMPETITORS BRAWNY FELLOWS WITH BARE LEGS DIRTY TUNICS AND LONG BEARDS GOING ABOUT WITH BOTTLES LASHED TO THEIR BACKS AND SHOUTING HONEY OF WINE
AND THE BLOODLESSNESS OF THOSE CONVOLUTIONS RELATED TO NATURAL SLEEP BUT WE ARE NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT CONTROL OVER THEM WE CAN WE KNOW HELP TO COMPOSE OURSELVES TO SLEEP AS WE SAY IN ORDINARY LANGUAGE
AND POSSIBLY PREY UPON THE POCKETS OF A CREDULOUS AND WONDER LOVING PUBLIC SUCH NAMES AS MESMERIC CONDITION MAGNETIC SLEEP CLAIRVOYANCE ELECTRO BIOLOGY ANIMAL MAGNETISM FAITH TRANCE AND MANY OTHER ALIASES
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HYPNOTISM IS A COMPLEX STATE WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED IN AN OFFHAND WAY IN A SENTENCE OR TWO THERE ARE HOWEVER CERTAIN ASPECTS OF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE MAY SUPPOSE SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED
FOLLOWING THE HEBREW SYSTEM THE MEETING OF THE WISE MEN DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTERS TOOK PLACE IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE TWENTY FIFTH DAY OF THE THIRD MONTH OF THE YEAR THAT IS SAY
THIS PROVES THAT IT HAS IMPRESSED HIS SENSIBILITY HE HAS FELT BUT NOT PERCEIVED IT HE HAD ACTUALLY IGNORED IT REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE IT AS IT WERE DOCTOR ERNEST HART AN ENGLISH WRITER
WHILE THE INVESTING SURFACE SHOWS A SYSTEM OF COMPLICATED CONVOLUTIONS RICH IN GRAY MATTER THICKLY SOWN WITH MICROSCOPIC CELLS IN WHICH THE NERVE ENDS TERMINATE AT THE BASE OF THE BRAIN IS A COMPLETE CIRCLE OF ARTERIES
SUCH AS THE BEATING OF THE HEART THE BREATHING MOTIONS OF THE LUNGS WHICH MAINTAIN LIFE AND ARE CONTROLLED BY THE LOWER BRAIN CENTERS OF GANGLIA ARE QUICKLY STOPPED AND DEATH ENSUES WE KNOW BY OBSERVATION IN CASES WHERE PORTIONS OF THE SKULL HAVE BEEN REMOVED
WHERE NOT INFREQUENTLY THREE HUNDRED DOGS ARE ENTERED IN ONE HANDICAP THE BOROUGH GROUNDS AT OLDHAM AND THE WELLINGTON GROUNDS AT BURY ARE ALSO NOTED CENTRES FOR RACES
SURROUND THE ORIGINAL STROKE WITH OTHER STROKES EXACTLY LIKE IT AND ASK HIM WHAT HE SEES HE WILL POINT OUT ONE BY ONE THE NEW STROKES AND OMIT THE ORIGINAL ONE EVERY TIME NO MATTER HOW NUMEROUS THE NEXT STROKES MAY BE
AT THE CORNER WHERE THE LANE OPENS OUT INTO THE COURT SOME WOMEN SIT WITH THEIR BACKS AGAINST THE GRAY STONES OF THE WALL THEIR DRESS IS THAT COMMON TO THE HUMBLER CLASSES OF THE COUNTRY A LINEN FROCK EXTENDING THE FULL LENGTH OF THE PERSON
PROBABLY IN NO OTHER BREED EXCEPT THE GREYHOUND DO JUDGES ATTACH SO LITTLE IMPORTANCE TO THE SHAPE OF THE HEAD SO LONG AS THE JAWS ARE FAIRLY LONG AND THE COLOUR OF THE EYES SOMEWHAT IN KEEPING WITH THAT OF THE BODY
THE DISTANCE COVERED IN THE RACE IS GENERALLY TWO HUNDRED YARDS MINUS THE STARTS ALLOTTED AND SOME IDEA OF THE SPEED AT WHICH THESE VERY ACTIVE LITTLE ANIMALS CAN TRAVEL MAY BE GLEANED FROM THE FACT THAT THE FULL DISTANCE HAS BEEN COVERED
DEFENDED BY A TOWER MUCH MORE IMPOSING THAN THE OLD ONE THE LOCATION OF THE GATE HOWEVER WAS NOT DISTURBED FOR THE REASONS MOST LIKELY THAT THE ROADS WHICH MET AND MERGED IN FRONT OF IT COULD NOT WELL BE TRANSFERRED TO ANY OTHER POINT
AS ARE ADEQUATE TO PRODUCE SLEEP IN THE NATURAL STATE OR ARTIFICIAL SLUMBER EITHER BY TOTAL DEPRIVATION OR BY EXCESSIVE INCREASE OR LOCAL ABERRATION IN THE QUANTITY OR QUALITY OF BLOOD
AND FOR FEAR OF THEIR PICKING UP THE LEAST BIT OF REFUSE EACH IS SECURELY MUZZLED BY A BOX LIKE LEATHER ARRANGEMENT WHICH COMPLETELY ENVELOPS THE JAWS BUT WHICH IS FREELY PERFORATED TO PERMIT PROPER BREATHING
WHICH I DO NOT THINK IT VERY DIFFICULT TO ACQUIRE WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY PERSONS CAN WAKE AT A FIXED HOUR IN THE MORNING BY SETTING THEIR MINDS UPON IT JUST BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP NOW THERE IS SOMETHING HERE WHICH DESERVES A LITTLE FURTHER EXAMINATION
NOW I AM GOING TO CUT YOUR LEG OFF BUT IT WILL NOT HURT YOU IN THE LEAST AND THE PATIENT SUFFERS NOTHING IN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION PROFESSOR WILLIAM JAMES OF HARVARD COLLEGE
MAY SIMULTANEOUSLY BECOME HIGHLY CONGESTED NOW IF THE BRAIN OR ANY PART OF IT BE DEPRIVED OF THE CIRCULATION OF BLOOD THROUGH IT OR BE RENDERED PARTIALLY BLOODLESS OR IF IT BE EXCESSIVELY CONGESTED AND OVERLOADED WITH BLOOD
NO MORE AFFECTIONATE CREATURE IS TO BE FOUND YET HE POSSESSES CONSIDERABLE DETERMINATION AND PLUCK AND ON OCCASION WILL DEFEND HIMSELF IN HIS OWN WAY TOO FRAGILE IN HIS ANATOMY FOR FIGHTING IN THE ORDINARY SENSE OF THE WORD
THE STARTING POINT OF EACH COMPETITOR BEING REGULATED BY ITS WEIGHT BUT THE WINNERS OF PREVIOUS IMPORTANT EVENTS ARE PENALISED IN ADDITION ACCORDING TO THEIR PRESUMED MERIT BY HAVING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YARDS DEDUCTED FROM THE START
AND ARE SO CLEAN THAT EVEN SCRUPULOUS HOUSEWIVES TAKE NO OBJECTION TO THEIR FINDING THEIR WAY UNDER THE CLOTHES TO THE FOOT OF THE BED THEREBY SECURING THEIR OWN PROTECTION AND SERVING AS AN EXCELLENT FOOTWARMER IN THE WINTER MONTHS
SANDALS AND AN UNBLEACHED UNDYED BLANKET CROSSED OVER ONE SHOULDER AND GIRT ROUND THE WAIST NEAR BY AND FAR MORE IMPOSING AND GROTESQUE THOUGH SCARCELY AS PATIENT AS THE DONKEY KNEELS A CAMEL RAW BONED ROUGH AND GRAY
OR TO ANY INFLUENCE WHICH HE EXERCISES UPON INANIMATE OBJECTS DISTANCE DOES NOT AFFECT IT NOR PROXIMITY NOR THE INTERVENTION OF ANY CONDUCTORS OR NON CONDUCTORS WHETHER SILK OR GLASS OR STONE OR EVEN A BRICK WALL
BUT IN VIEW OF THE HANDICAP TERMS THOSE DOGS WHICH POSSESS SPEED
VESUVIUS OR FUSIYAMA OR STILL HOTTER PLACES MAY BE PRODUCED OR DREAMS OF ADVENTURE ON FROZEN SURFACES OR IN ARCTIC REGIONS MAY BE CREATED BY APPLYING ICE TO THE FEET OF THE SLEEPER
MEANS SO MANY YARDS AND THE AVERAGE SPEED WORKING OUT AT ABOUT SIXTEEN YARDS PER SECOND NEARLY TWICE AS FAST AS THE FASTEST PEDESTRIAN SPRINTER AND ALTOGETHER BEYOND THE POWER OF THE FLEETEST RACE HORSE
RATHER WIDE BETWEEN THE EYES AND FLAT ON THE TOP THE JAW POWERFUL YET CLEANLY CUT THE TEETH LEVEL AND WHITE EYES BRIGHT AND FIERY EARS SMALL FINE IN TEXTURE AND ROSE SHAPE
AND SOME LEATHERN BOTTLES AMONG THE JARS AND BOTTLES ROLLING UPON THE STONY FLOOR REGARDLESS OF THE CROWD AND COLD OFTEN IN DANGER BUT NEVER HURT PLAY HALF A DOZEN HALF NAKED CHILDREN THEIR BROWN BODIES JETTY EYES
ANY DISTANCE BETWEEN SIX AND A DOZEN MILES A DAY ACCORDING TO THE STAMINA AND CONDITION OF THE DOG IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PROPER AMOUNT OF EXERCISE AND SCALES ARE BROUGHT INTO USE EVERY FEW DAYS TO GAUGE THE EFFECT WHICH IS BEING PRODUCED
WHICH SHOULD BE STRONG AND POWERFUL FORE LEGS RATHER LONG WELL SET UNDER THE DOG POSSESSING A FAIR AMOUNT OF BONE HIND QUARTERS STRONG AND BROAD ACROSS STIFLES WELL BENT THIGHS BROAD AND MUSCULAR
OF VERY ANCIENT PARENTAGE AND DATE WHICH WILL I THINK HELP TO AN EXPLANATION FIRST LET US RECALL SOMETHING OF WHAT WE KNOW OF THE ANATOMY AND LOCALIZATION OF FUNCTION IN THE BRAIN AND OF THE NATURE OF ORDINARY SLEEP THE BRAIN AS YOU KNOW
ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCE PROBABLY THERE IS NO LOCALITY WHERE THE PASTIME HAS MAINTAINED SUCH A FIRM HOLD AS IN AND AROUND OLDHAM ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS TRACKS IN THE WORLD BEING AT HIGGINSHAW
THAT PERSONAL INFLUENCE WHICH WE ALL EXERT AT VARIOUS TIMES AND WHICH HE IGNORES NOT BECAUSE HE WOULD DENY IT BUT BECAUSE HE FEARS LENDING COUNTENANCE TO THE MAGNETIC FLUID AND OTHER SIMILAR THEORIES SAYS HE
IN A LIKE MANNER IT IS POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE COMA AND PROLONGED INSENSIBILITY BY PRESSURE OF THE THUMBS ON THE CAROTID OR HALLUCINATION DREAMS AND VISIONS BY DRUGS OR BY EXTERNAL STIMULATION OF THE NERVES
THE BEST OF THE MALES ARE NOT SO CLASSICAL IN OUTLINE AS THE FEMALES THOUGH SOME OF THEM ARE AS GOOD IN LEGS AND FEET POINTS WHICH ARE OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE THOUGH IT IS NOT QUITE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARD LAID DOWN BY THE CLUB IT WILL BE FOUND THAT MOST JUDGES
IN THE NATURAL BRAIN AND THE NATURAL BODY I WISH TO BRING UNDER NOTICE IN EXPLANATION OF THE TRUE AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE FALSE OR FALSELY INTERPRETED PHENOMENA OF HYPNOTISM MESMERISM AND ELECTRO BIOLOGY
EITHER IN MEN OR IN ANIMALS THAT DURING NATURAL SLEEP THE UPPER PART OF THE BRAIN ITS CONVOLUTED SURFACE WHICH IN HEALTH AND IN THE WAKING STATE IS FAINTLY PINK LIKE A BLUSHING CHEEK
IN SHORT DOCTOR HART'S THEORY IS THAT HYPNOTISM COMES FROM CONTROLLING THE BLOOD SUPPLY OF THE BRAIN CUTTING OFF THE SUPPLY FROM PARTS OR INCREASING IT IN OTHER PARTS THIS THEORY IS BORNE OUT BY THE WELL KNOWN FACT THAT SOME PERSONS CAN BLUSH OR TURN PALE AT WILL
FROM WHICH SPRING GREAT NUMBERS OF SMALL ARTERIAL VESSELS CARRYING A PROFUSE BLOOD SUPPLY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MASS AND CAPABLE OF CONTRACTION IN SMALL TRACTS SO THAT SMALL AREAS OF THE BRAIN MAY AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT BECOME BLOODLESS WHILE OTHER PARTS OF THE BRAIN
WHEN THE WEATHER IS COLD AND WET MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE OPINION BUT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ROAM ABOUT A HOUSE THE WHIPPET WILL FIND A COMFORTABLE PLACE AND WILL RARELY AIL ANYTHING IN SCORES OF HOUSES WHIPPETS GO TO BED WITH THE CHILDREN
AND THICK BLACK HAIR ATTESTING THE BLOOD OF ISRAEL SOMETIMES FROM UNDER THE WIMPLES THE MOTHERS LOOK UP AND IN THE VERNACULAR MODESTLY BESPEAK THEIR TRADE IN THE BOTTLES HONEY OF GRAPES IN THE JARS STRONG DRINK
WE FREE OURSELVES FROM THE INFLUENCE OF NOISES OF STRONG LIGHT OF POWERFUL COLORS OR OF TACTILE IMPRESSIONS WE LIE DOWN AND ENDEAVOR TO SOOTHE BRAIN ACTIVITY BY DRIVING AWAY DISTURBING THOUGHTS OR AS PEOPLE SOMETIMES SAY
AND IT IS WITHIN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT THE KENNEL CLUB HAS PLACED THE BREED ON ITS RECOGNISED LIST THE FOLLOWING IS THE STANDARD OF POINTS ADOPTED BY THE WHIPPET CLUB HEAD LONG AND LEAN
ARE MOST TO BE MET WITH HOWEVER IN SOME QUARTERS THE IDEA IS PREVALENT THAT WHIPPETS ARE DELICATE IN THEIR CONSTITUTION BUT THIS IS A POPULAR ERROR PROBABLY THEIR DISINCLINATION TO GO OUT OF DOORS ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE
THE RACE IS STARTED AND IN LESS TIME THAN IT TAKES TO WRITE IT THE COMPETITORS REACH THE GOAL ONE AND ALL AS THEY FINISH TAKING A FLYING LEAP AT THEIR TRAINER'S TOWEL TO WHICH THEY HOLD ON WITH SUCH TENACITY THAT THEY ARE SWUNG ROUND IN THE AIR
A PURELY SUBJECTIVE MENTAL ACTIVITY ACTING THROUGH A MECHANISM OF WHICH THE BOY IS QUITE IGNORANT AND WHICH HE IS UNABLE TO CONTROL AND PRODUCING THAT ACTION ON THE VESSELS OF DILATION OR CONTRACTION WHICH AS WE HAVE SEEN
SUCH AS OPIUM OR WE MAY INDUCE HALLUCINATIONS BY INTRODUCING INTO THE BLOOD OTHER TOXIC SUBSTANCES SUCH AS INDIAN HEMP OR STRAMONIUM WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUS OF THE MECHANISM PRODUCING THE ARTERIAL CONTRACTION
THAT SOME PEOPLE ALWAYS BLUSH ON THE MENTION OF CERTAIN THINGS OR CALLING UP CERTAIN IDEAS CERTAIN OTHER IDEAS WILL MAKE THEM TURN PALE NOW IF CERTAIN PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE MADE TO BLUSH OR TURN PALE
NOW HANGING WITH HAND AND FOOT TO THE FACE OF THE CRAG NOW SWINGING IN A BASKET FAR DOWN THE MOUNTAIN FISSURE BLENT WITH PEDDLERS OF JEWELRY SHARP MEN CLOAKED IN SCARLET AND BLUE TOP HEAVY UNDER PRODIGIOUS WHITE TURBANS
ARE NECESSARY FOR THE ABOLITION OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE ABEYANCE OF THE WILL OF THE SUBJECT WE NOW SEE THAT IDEAS ARISING IN THE MIND OF THE SUBJECT ARE SUFFICIENT TO INFLUENCE THE CIRCULATION IN THE BRAIN OF THE PERSON OPERATED ON AND SUCH VARIATIONS OF THE BLOOD SUPPLY OF THE BRAIN
TO FORM THE ARTERIAL CIRCLE OF WILLIS AT THE BASE OF THE BRAIN WITHIN THE SKULL OF WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN AND WHICH SUPPLIES THE BRAIN WITH BLOOD WE QUICKLY AS EVERY ONE KNOWS PRODUCE INSENSIBILITY
THAT THE WILL OR THE GESTURES OR THE MAGNETIC OR VITAL FLUID OF THE OPERATOR
IN AN ARTICLE IN THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL GIVES A GENERAL EXPLANATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE MAY ACCEPT AS TRUE SO FAR AS IT GOES BUT WHICH IS EVIDENTLY INCOMPLETE HE SEEMS TO MINIMIZE PERSONAL INFLUENCE TOO MUCH
THE RAYS OF THE SUN WITH THEIR PROMISE OF WARMTH LINGERED PROVOKINGLY FAR UP ON THE BATTLEMENTS AND TURRETS OF THE GREAT PILES ABOUT DOWN FROM WHICH FELL THE CROONING OF PIGEONS AND THE WHIR OF THE FLOCKS COMING AND GOING
OR TO AFFECT THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE SUBJECT BY ANY ONE OF A GREAT NUMBER OF CONTRIVANCES WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN I WILL REFER TO ONE OR TWO FACTS IN RELATION TO THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN AND SHOW ONE OR TWO SIMPLE EXPERIMENTS
OR THE SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY SEVENTH OF ROME THE SIXTY SEVENTH OF HEROD THE GREAT AND THE THIRTY FIFTH OF HIS REIGN THE FOURTH BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA THE HOURS OF THE DAY BY JUDEAN CUSTOM BEGIN WITH THE SUN
VERY LITTLE ELSE IS LOOKED FOR IN FRONT OF THE EARS AS IN THE CASE OF RACING COMPETITORS REALLY GOOD DOGS FOR SHOW PURPOSES ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND THAN BITCHES
TRY TO THINK OF NOTHING AND HAPPILY WE GENERALLY SUCCEED MORE OR LESS WELL SOME PEOPLE POSSESS AN EVEN MORE MARKED CONTROL OVER THIS MECHANISM OF SLEEP I CAN GENERALLY SUCCEED IN PUTTING MYSELF TO SLEEP AT ANY HOUR OF THE DAY EITHER IN THE LIBRARY CHAIR OR IN THE BROUGHAM
AND AT A TIME WHEN RECORDS OF PEDIGREES WERE NOT OFFICIALLY PRESERVED BUT IT IS VERY CERTAIN THAT THE GREYHOUND HAD A SHARE IN HIS GENEALOGICAL HISTORY FOR NOT ONLY SHOULD HIS APPEARANCE BE PRECISELY THAT OF A GREYHOUND IN MINIATURE
OR IF IT BE SUBJECTED TO LOCAL PRESSURE THE PART OF THE BRAIN SO ACTED UPON CEASES TO BE CAPABLE OF EXERCISING ITS FUNCTIONS THE REGULARITY OF THE ACTION OF THE BRAIN AND THE SANITY AND COMPLETENESS OF THE THOUGHT
BY CERTAIN SCIENTIFIC WRITERS ON THE SUBJECT FIRST WHAT IS THE CHARACTER OF THE DELUSIONS APPARENTLY CREATED IN THE MIND OF A PERSON IN THE HYPNOTIC CONDITION BY A SIMPLE WORD OF MOUTH STATEMENT AS WHEN A PHYSICIAN SAYS
AS A PASSING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE HOLY CITY STRANGERS AS WELL AS RESIDENTS WILL BE NECESSARY TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF SOME OF THE PAGES WHICH FOLLOW IT WILL BE WELL TO STOP AT THE GATE AND PASS THE SCENE IN REVIEW
BUSINESS ALWAYS AGGRESSIVE HAD PUSHED THROUGH THE ARCHED ENTRANCE INTO A NARROW LANE AND COURT WHICH PASSING BY THE WALLS OF THE GREAT TOWER CONDUCTED ON INTO THE CITY AS JERUSALEM IS IN THE HILL COUNTRY THE MORNING AIR ON THIS OCCASION WAS NOT A LITTLE CRISP
IT IS ESPECIALLY SO IN THE LANE AND COURT THE GROUND THERE IS PAVED WITH BROAD UNSHAPED FLAGS FROM WHICH EACH CRY AND JAR AND HOOF STAMP ARISES TO SWELL THE MEDLEY THAT RINGS AND ROARS UP BETWEEN THE SOLID IMPENDING WALLS
WE CAN TRANSMIT THE ORDER TO SLEEP BY TELEPHONE OR BY TELEGRAPH WE CAN PRACTICALLY GET THE SAME RESULTS WHILE ELIMINATING EVEN THE OPERATOR IF WE CAN CONTRIVE TO INFLUENCE THE IMAGINATION
WHICH HAVE CONTRACTED THE MUSCLES OF THE FEET OR SKIN MUSCLES OR HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ASSOCIATED IDEAS AND EXPLOSION OF LAUGHTER IN THE SAME WAY IF DURING SLEEP HEAT BE APPLIED TO THE SOLES OF THE FEET DREAMS OF WALKING OVER HOT SURFACES
WHICH HAS BORROWED A GOOD DEAL FROM THE DUST OF THE ROADS AND THE SANDS OF THE DESERT HE WEARS A FADED TARBOOSHE A LOOSE GOWN SLEEVELESS UNBELTED AND DROPPING FROM THE NECK TO THE KNEE HIS FEET ARE BARE THE CAMEL RESTLESS UNDER THE LOAD
A SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION OF HYPNOTISM DOCTOR HART'S THEORY IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THIS BOOK THE READER WILL FIND A SUMMARY OF THE THEORIES OF HYPNOTISM
BLEATING KIDS AND AWKWARD CAMELS ANIMALS OF EVERY KIND EXCEPT THE OUTLAWED SWINE ALL THESE ARE THERE NOT SINGLY AS DESCRIBED BUT MANY TIMES REPEATED NOT IN ONE PLACE BUT EVERYWHERE IN THE MARKET TURNING FROM THIS SCENE IN THE LANE AND COURT
AND BEFORE GLUCK STOOD HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER THANK YOU SAID THE MONARCH
ITS EYE MOVED TO THE BOTTLE WHICH HANS HELD IN HIS HAND HE RAISED IT DRANK SPURNED THE ANIMAL WITH HIS FOOT AND PASSED ON AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS
THEN GLUCK TOOK SOME BREAD IN HIS BASKET
AND THUS THE TREASURE VALLEY BECAME A GARDEN AGAIN AND THE INHERITANCE WHICH HAD BEEN LOST BY CRUELTY WAS REGAINED BY LOVE AND GLUCK WENT AND DWELT IN THE VALLEY AND THE POOR WERE NEVER DRIVEN FROM HIS DOOR
FOR PRESENTLY THE SOUND OF MUSIC FLOATED OUT FROM THE PARLOR MUSIC SO SOFT SO SWEET THAT INVOLUNTARILY THE BOY STOPPED HIS CRYING TO LISTEN THEN QUIETER TEARS DROPPED SLOWLY
THEN GLUCK STRUGGLED WITH HIMSELF AND DETERMINED TO BEAR THE THIRST A LITTLE LONGER AND HE PUT THE BOTTLE TO THE CHILD'S LIPS AND IT DRANK IT ALL BUT A FEW DROPS
HE STRETCHED HIS ARMS TO HANS AND CRIED FEEBLY WATER I AM DYING I HAVE NONE REPLIED HANS THOU HAST HAD THY SHARE OF LIFE
DRANK AND PASSED ON AND A DARK GRAY CLOUD CAME OVER THE SUN AND LONG SNAKELIKE SHADOWS CREPT UP ALONG THE MOUNTAIN SIDES HANS STRUGGLED ON THE SUN WAS SINKING
HOW LITTLE GLUCK SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER AND HOW HE PROSPERED THEREIN WITH OTHER MATTERS OF INTEREST WHEN GLUCK FOUND THAT SCHWARTZ DID NOT COME BACK HE WAS VERY SORRY AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO
BUT THE PRIEST COULD NOT GIVE ANY HOLY WATER TO SO ABANDONED A CHARACTER SO HANS WENT TO VESPERS IN THE EVENING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND UNDER PRETENSE OF CROSSING HIMSELF STOLE A CUPFUL
SQUIRE SENT YOU A LETTER AND I'M HAVING SUCH A JOLLY TIME I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEN RUMMAGED OUT THE NOTE WITH REMORSEFUL HASTE PROTESTING THAT HE WAS IN NO HURRY FOR MISTER GULLIVER
WITH A SHADOW CREEPING OVER HER FACE AS SOFTLY AS THE TWILIGHT WAS STEALING OVER THE WORLD WHILE THE DEW FELL AND EVERY THING GREW STILL AND DIM BEN DEAR I'VE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU
AND BEN SWAYED ABOUT IN HIS CHAIR AS IF HE WAS ALREADY DOING IT IN IMAGINATION YOU MAY TAKE A TURN ROUND MY FIELD ON LITA ANY DAY SHE WOULD LIKE IT
AND THE WATER WHICH IS FOUND IN THE VESSEL OF MERCY IS HOLY THOUGH IT HAD BEEN DEFILED WITH CORPSES SO SAYING THE DWARF STOOPED AND PLUCKED A LILY THAT GREW AT HIS FEET
THEN IT SMILED ON HIM AND GOT UP AND RAN DOWN THE HILL AND GLUCK LOOKED AFTER IT TILL IT BECAME AS SMALL AS A LITTLE STAR AND THEN TURNED AND BEGAN CLIMBING AGAIN
EVEN WITH NO GOLDEN RIVER TO SEEK FOR LEVEL LINES OF DEWY MIST LAY STRETCHED ALONG THE VALLEY OUT OF WHICH ROSE THE MASSY MOUNTAINS THEIR LOWER CLIFFS IN PALE GRAY SHADOW
AND THANKED HER BY LAYING HIS CHEEK AGAINST THE PRETTY SLIPPER THAT RESTED ON THE STEP BESIDE HIM AS IF HE HAD NO WORDS IN WHICH TO SWEAR LOYALTY TO THE GENTLE MISTRESS WHOM HE MEANT HENCEFORTH TO SERVE WITH GRATEFUL FIDELITY
AND THE GOOD CREATURE CROUCHED AT HER FEET LIKE A SMALL LION BOUND TO GUARD HER AND HER HOUSE FOR EVERMORE DON'T LIE ON THAT COLD STONE BEN COME HERE AND LET ME TRY TO COMFORT YOU
AS HE DID SO AN ICY CHILL SHOT THROUGH HIS LIMBS HE STAGGERED SHRIEKED AND FELL THE WATERS CLOSED OVER HIS CRY
SHOOK THE BOTTLE OF HOLY WATER IN SCHWARTZ'S FACE TILL IT FROTHED AGAIN AND MARCHED OFF IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS IN THE WORLD IT WAS INDEED A MORNING THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE ANYONE HAPPY
AND TO THIS DAY THE INHABITANTS OF THE VALLEY POINT OUT THE PLACE WHERE THE THREE DROPS OF HOLY DEW WERE CAST INTO THE STREAM AND TRACE THE COURSE OF THE GOLDEN RIVER UNDER THE GROUND UNTIL IT EMERGES IN THE TREASURE VALLEY
THEN SO SAD THAT IF ANY ONE HAD BEEN LOOKING HE WOULD HAVE WONDERED WHAT BAD NEWS HAD CHASED AWAY THE SUNSHINE SO SUDDENLY NO ONE DID LOOK
HIS THIRST BECAME INTOLERABLE AGAIN AND WHEN HE LOOKED AT HIS BOTTLE HE SAW THAT THERE WERE ONLY FIVE OR SIX DROPS LEFT IN IT AND HE COULD NOT VENTURE TO DRINK AND AS HE WAS HANGING THE FLASK TO HIS BELT AGAIN
HE KNEW HE WAS AN ORPHAN NOW AND TURNED INSTINCTIVELY TO THE OLD FRIEND WHO LOVED HIM BEST THROWING HIMSELF DOWN BESIDE HIS DOG BEN CLUNG ABOUT THE CURLY NECK SOBBING BITTERLY
YOU CAN'T YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM OH DADDY DADDY IF I'D ONLY SEEN YOU JEST ONCE MORE NO ONE COULD GRANT THAT WISH BUT MISS CELIA DID COMFORT HIM
SEEMING TO SOOTHE HIS PAIN AS THEY FELL WHILE THE SENSE OF LONELINESS PASSED AWAY AND IT GREW POSSIBLE TO WAIT TILL IT WAS TIME TO GO TO FATHER IN THAT FAR OFF COUNTRY LOVELIER THAN GOLDEN CALIFORNIA
THERE OPENED WHERE THEY FELL A SMALL CIRCULAR WHIRLPOOL INTO WHICH THE WATERS DESCENDED WITH A MUSICAL NOISE GLUCK STOOD WATCHING IT FOR SOME TIME VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED
AIN'T THAT BLACK ONE A BEAUTY SEEMS AS IF I COULD SEE HIS MANE BLOW IN THE WIND AND HEAR HIM WHINNY TO THAT SMALL FELLER TROTTING DOWN TO SEE IF HE CAN'T GET OVER AND BE SOCIABLE HOW I'D LIKE TO TAKE A ROUSIN RUN ROUND THAT MEADOW ON THE WHOLE LOT OF EM
AND PURE WHITE TRANSPARENT LILIES AND CRIMSON AND PURPLE BUTTERFLIES DARTED HITHER AND THITHER AND THE SKY SENT DOWN SUCH PURE LIGHT THAT GLUCK HAD NEVER FELT SO HAPPY IN HIS LIFE
AND CREEPING PLANTS GREW AND CLIMBED AMONG THE MOISTENING SOIL YOUNG FLOWERS OPENED SUDDENLY ALONG THE RIVERSIDES AS STARS LEAP OUT WHEN TWILIGHT IS DEEPENING AND THICKETS OF MYRTLE AND TENDRILS OF VINE
THEY BEAT HIM AGAIN TILL THEIR ARMS WERE TIRED AND STAGGERED TO BED
AND WAS FLOWING IN INNUMERABLE STREAMS AMONG THE DRY HEAPS OF RED SAND AND AS GLUCK GAZED FRESH GRASS SPRANG BESIDE THE NEW STREAMS
HE STRODE OVER THE PROSTRATE BODY AND DARTED ON AND A FLASH OF BLUE LIGHTNING ROSE OUT OF THE EAST SHAPED LIKE A SWORD IT SHOOK THRICE OVER THE WHOLE HEAVEN
AS SHE SAID THE LAST TWO WORDS WITH HER HAND ON BEN'S SHOULDER MADE HIM LOOK UP QUICKLY AND TURN RED WITH PLEASURE WONDERING WHAT THE SQUIRE HAD WRITTEN ABOUT HIM MOTHER MUST HAVE SOME OF THE PARTY
GLANCE AFTER GLANCE HE CAST ON THE FLASK OF WATER WHICH HUNG AT HIS BELT THREE DROPS ARE ENOUGH AT LAST THOUGHT HE
HAD TAKEN THE BOY INTO THEIR GENTLE KEEPING THE WIND HAD SUNG A LULLABY AMONG THE RUSTLING LILACS
CHAPTER TEN A HEAVY TROUBLE THANK YOU MA'AM THAT'S A TIP TOP BOOK SPECIALLY THE PICTURES BUT I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE THESE POOR FELLOWS
WITH A LOW WHINE AS IF HE SAID COUNT ME IN AND LET ME HELP TO PAY MY MASTER'S DEBT IF I CAN MISS CELIA SHOOK THE OFFERED PAW CORDIALLY
AND THE SOURCE OF THE GOLDEN RIVER HE ENTERED ON IT WITH THE BOLDNESS OF A PRACTICED MOUNTAINEER YET HE THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER TRAVERSED SO STRANGE OR SO DANGEROUS A GLACIER IN HIS LIFE THE ICE WAS EXCESSIVELY SLIPPERY
AND AS HE WENT HE THOUGHT HE HEARD THE NOISE OF WATER WORKING ITS WAY UNDER THE GROUND AND WHEN HE CAME IN SIGHT OF THE TREASURE VALLEY BEHOLD A RIVER LIKE THE GOLDEN RIVER WAS SPRINGING FROM A NEW CLEFT OF THE ROCKS ABOVE IT
FOR GLUCK SHOWED MANIFEST SYMPTOMS OF CONSTERNATION AT THIS UNLOOKED FOR REPLY TO HIS LAST OBSERVATION WHY DIDN'T YOU COME BEFORE CONTINUED THE DWARF
WHY SON SAID THE OLD MAN I AM FAINT WITH THIRST GIVE ME SOME OF THAT WATER THEN GLUCK LOOKED AT HIM AND WHEN HE SAW THAT HE WAS PALE AND WEARY
STILL KEPT GUARD BESIDE HIS LITTLE MASTER WHO WITH HIS HEAD PILLOWED ON HIS ARM LAY FAST ASLEEP
IT WAS WITH A NEW AND OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF PANIC TERROR THAT HE LEAPED THE LAST CHASM AND FLUNG HIMSELF EXHAUSTED AND SHUDDERING ON THE FIRM TURF OF THE MOUNTAIN
HE STOOD AT THE BRINK OF THE CHASM THROUGH WHICH IT RAN ITS WAVES WERE FILLED WITH THE RED GLORY OF THE SUNSET THEY SHOOK THEIR CRESTS LIKE TONGUES OF FIRE AND FLASHES OF BLOODY LIGHT GLEAMED ALONG THEIR FOAM
INSTEAD OF SENDING ME THOSE RASCALLY BROTHERS OF YOURS FOR ME TO HAVE THE TROUBLE OF TURNING INTO STONES VERY HARD STONES THEY MAKE TOO O DEAR ME SAID GLUCK HAVE YOU REALLY BEEN SO CRUEL
AND SHE'S GOIN TO HAVE THE SEATS IN THE PORCH LIFT UP
AND BEN GRATEFULLY SURVEYED THE ARAB CHIEF NOW HIS OWN THOUGH THE BEST OF ALL THE COLLECTION WON'T WE HAVE SPLENDID TIMES SHE SAYS WE MAY COME OVER EVERY NIGHT AND PLAY WITH HER AND THORNY
ASKED BAB AS BETTY TROTTED OFF IN A SILENT RAPTURE WITH THE BIG DARLING BOBBING OVER HER SHOULDER NOT YET I'VE SEVERAL THINGS TO SETTLE WITH MY NEW MAN
BUT HE THOUGHT THAT A STRANGE SHADOW HAD SUDDENLY COME ACROSS THE BLUE SKY THE PATH BECAME STEEPER AND MORE RUGGED EVERY MOMENT AND THE HIGH HILL AIR INSTEAD OF REFRESHING HIM
HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON HIS BASKET OF FOOD WHICH BECAME A PERILOUS INCUMBRANCE ON THE GLACIER AND HAD NOW NO MEANS OF REFRESHING HIMSELF BUT BY BREAKING OFF AND EATING SOME OF THE PIECES OF ICE
AND HE THOUGHT OF THE DWARF'S WORDS THAT NO ONE COULD SUCCEED EXCEPT IN HIS FIRST ATTEMPT
HE LAY A LONG TIME TO REST ON THE GRASS AFTER HE HAD GOT OVER
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT I'LL BE GOOD THEN AS KINDLY AS SHE COULD MISS CELIA READ THE BRIEF LETTER WHICH TOLD THE HARD NEWS BLUNTLY
NOT MONOTONOUS OR LOW BUT CHANGEFUL AND LOUD RISING OCCASIONALLY INTO DRIFTING PASSAGES OF WILD MELODY THEN BREAKING OFF INTO SHORT MELANCHOLY TONES
THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH WAS THAT THE TWO BROTHERS AFTER WRANGLING A LONG TIME ON THE KNOTTY QUESTION WHICH OF THEM SHOULD TRY HIS FORTUNE FIRST DREW THEIR SWORDS AND BEGAN FIGHTING
FOR THERE WAS A QUIVER IN HER VOICE THE MEANING OF WHICH HE FELT BEFORE HE UNDERSTOOD MISS CELIA PUT HER ARMS ABOUT HIM AND ANSWERED VERY TENDERLY BEN DEAR
AND SHE DOESN'T MIND HOW MANY QUESTIONS WE ASK I LIKE FOLKS THAT WILL TELL ME THINGS ADDED BAB WHOSE INQUISITIVE MIND WAS ALWAYS HUNGRY
APPARENTLY IN THE LAST AGONY OF DEATH FROM THIRST ITS TONGUE WAS OUT ITS JAWS DRY ITS LIMBS EXTENDED LIFELESSLY AND A SWARM OF BLACK ANTS WERE CRAWLING ABOUT ITS LIPS AND THROAT
AND THIS IS THE LETTER MISTER SMITHERS SENDS HOORAY WHERE IS HE PLEASE CRIED BEN WISHING SHE WOULD HURRY UP FOR MISS CELIA DID NOT EVEN OFFER HIM THE LETTER
SHE IS SO NICELY ASLEEP IT IS A PITY TO WAKE HER GOOD BY TILL TO MORROW LITTLE NEIGHBORS CONTINUED MISS CELIA AND DISMISSED THE GIRLS WITH A KISS IS BEN COMING TOO
CONFOUND THE KING AND HIS GOLD TOO SAID GLUCK AND HE OPENED THE FLASK AND POURED ALL THE WATER INTO THE DOG'S MOUTH THE DOG SPRANG UP AND STOOD ON ITS HIND LEGS
AND VERY GLAD TO SAVE HIM FOR ANOTHER DAY LEAVING THE YOUNG FOLKS BUSY WITH THEIR GAMES MISS CELIA SAT IN THE PORCH TO READ HER LETTERS FOR THERE WERE TWO AND AS SHE READ HER FACE GREW SO SOBER
AND MISS CELIA'S EYES TURNED TO THE DEEP SKY WHERE EARLY STARS WERE SHINING DIDN'T HE SEND FOR ME WHERE'S HE GONE WHEN S HE COMING BACK ASKED BEN QUICKLY
SLEPT IN THE BLUE SKY THE UTMOST PEAKS OF THE ETERNAL SNOW THE GOLDEN RIVER WHICH SPRANG FROM ONE OF THE LOWER AND SNOWLESS ELEVATIONS WAS NOW NEARLY IN SHADOW
BUT ITS DESCENT SEEMED TO BRING NO COOLNESS THE LEADEN HEIGHT OF THE DEAD AIR PRESSED UPON HIS BROW AND HEART BUT THE GOAL WAS NEAR HE SAW THE CATARACT OF THE GOLDEN RIVER SPRINGING FROM THE HILLSIDE
TOOK HIS ALPINE STAFF IN HIS HAND AND SET OFF FOR THE MOUNTAINS ON HIS WAY OUT OF THE TOWN HE HAD TO PASS THE PRISON AND AS HE LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOWS
AND GLUCK WENT ON AGAIN MERRILY AND THE PATH BECAME EASIER TO HIS FEET AND TWO OR THREE BLADES OF GRASS APPEARED UPON IT AND SOME GRASSHOPPERS BEGAN SINGING ON THE BANK BESIDE IT AND GLUCK THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER HEARD SUCH MERRY SINGING
YES HE SAID HE MIGHT GO AS FAR AS CALIFORNIA AND IF HE DID HE'D SEND FOR ME I'D LIKE TO GO THERE IT'S A REAL SPLENDID PLACE THEY SAY HE HAS GONE FURTHER AWAY THAN THAT TO A LOVELIER COUNTRY THAN CALIFORNIA I HOPE
AND BEN BROODED OVER THE FINE ETCHING OF THE DEAD AND DYING HORSES ON A BATTLE FIELD ONE PAST ALL FURTHER PAIN THE OTHER HELPLESS BUT LIFTING HIS HEAD FROM HIS DEAD MASTER TO NEIGH A FAREWELL TO THE COMRADES
FOR MISTER SMITHERS WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS THAT HE HAD KNOWN THE TRUTH MONTHS BEFORE AND NEVER TOLD THE BOY LEST HE SHOULD BE UNFITTED FOR THE WORK THEY GAVE HIM OF BEN BROWN THE ELDER'S DEATH THERE WAS LITTLE TO TELL
BUT AND HIS COUNTENANCE GREW STERN AS HE SPOKE THE WATER WHICH HAS BEEN REFUSED TO THE CRY OF THE WEARY AND DYING IS UNHOLY THOUGH IT HAD BEEN BLESSED BY EVERY SAINT IN HEAVEN
HE WAS MOREOVER SURPRISED ON SURMOUNTING THEM TO FIND THAT A LARGE GLACIER OF WHOSE EXISTENCE NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOUNTAINS HE HAD BEEN ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT LAY BETWEEN HIM
THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO GO AND THE HEAD BEN HAD LIFTED UP WITH A DESPERATE SORT OF LOOK WENT DOWN AGAIN ON SANCHO'S BREAST AS IF THERE WERE NO OTHER REFUGE LEFT
EXCEPT THAT HE WAS KILLED IN SOME WILD PLACE AT THE WEST AND A STRANGER WROTE THE FACT TO THE ONLY PERSON WHOSE NAME WAS FOUND IN BEN'S POCKET BOOK
MYRIADS OF DECEITFUL SHADOWS AND LURID LIGHTS PLAYED AND FLOATED ABOUT AND THROUGH THE PALE BLUE PINNACLES DAZZLING AND CONFUSING THE SIGHT OF THE TRAVELER WHILE HIS EARS GREW DULL AND HIS HEAD GIDDY
ALL BUT THE UPPERMOST JETS OF SPRAY WHICH ROSE LIKE SLOW SMOKE ABOVE THE UNDULATING LINE OF THE CATARACT AND FLOATED AWAY IN FEEBLE WREATHS UPON THE MORNING WIND ON THIS OBJECT AND ON THIS ALONE
MISTER SMITHERS OFFERED TO TAKE THE BOY BACK AND DO WELL BY HIM AVERRING THAT THE FATHER WISHED HIS SON TO REMAIN WHERE HE LEFT HIM AND FOLLOW THE PROFESSION TO WHICH HE WAS TRAINED
MY POOR LITTLE BOY I WISH I COULD SAY NO THERE WAS NO NEED OF ANY MORE WORDS NO NEED OF TEARS OR KIND ARMS AROUND HIM
THIS HOWEVER RELIEVED HIS THIRST AN HOUR'S REPOSE RECRUITED HIS HARDY FRAME AND WITH THE INDOMITABLE SPIRIT OF AVARICE HE RESUMED HIS LABORIOUS JOURNEY
HANS'S EYES AND THOUGHTS WERE FIXED FORGETTING THE DISTANCE HE HAD TO TRAVERSE HE SET OFF AT AN IMPRUDENT RATE OF WALKING WHICH GREATLY EXHAUSTED HIM BEFORE HE HAD SCALED THE FIRST RANGE OF THE GREEN AND LOW HILLS
QUESTIONING THE NEW FRIEND MEANTIME WITH EYES SO FULL OF DUMB LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND SORROW THAT THEY SEEMED ALMOST HUMAN WIPING AWAY HER OWN TEARS
WILL YOU GO BEN ASKED MISS CELIA HOPING TO DISTRACT HIS MIND FROM HIS GRIEF BY SPEAKING OF OTHER THINGS NO NO I'D RATHER TRAMP AND STARVE
MISS CELIA STOOPED TO PAT THE WHITE HEAD AND TO STROKE THE BLACK ONE LYING SO NEAR IT THAT THE DOG'S BREAST WAS THE BOY'S PILLOW PRESENTLY THE SOBBING CEASED AND BEN WHISPERED WITHOUT LOOKING UP
BUT BEN THOUGHT THERE NEVER WAS SO SWEET A LADY AS THE ONE WHO LEANED OVER HIM TO SHOW HIM HOW THE DISSECTED MAP WENT TOGETHER AND NEVER SMILED AT HIS MISTAKES
AND THEN THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF SWEET FLOWERS GROWING ON THE ROCKS BRIGHT GREEN MOSS WITH PALE PINK STARRY FLOWERS AND SOFT BELLED GENTIANS MORE BLUE THAN THE SKY AT ITS DEEPEST
SHE BEGAN SLOWLY AND THE BOY WAITED WITH A HAPPY FACE FOR NO ONE HAD CALLED HIM SO SINCE MELIA DIED THE SQUIRE HAS HEARD ABOUT YOUR FATHER
HE TURNED AND SAW A GRAY HAIRED OLD MAN EXTENDED ON THE ROCKS HIS EYES WERE SUNK HIS FEATURES DEADLY PALE AND GATHERED INTO AN EXPRESSION OF DESPAIR WATER
THE NOISE OF THE FRAY ALARMED THE NEIGHBORS WHO FINDING THEY COULD NOT PACIFY THE COMBATANTS SENT FOR THE CONSTABLE HANS ON HEARING THIS CONTRIVED TO ESCAPE AND HID HIMSELF
WHO GO GALLOPING AWAY IN A CLOUD OF DUST
AND HE'D BE WORSE NOW FATHER'S GONE DON'T SEND ME BACK LET ME STAY HERE
HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE FLOATING VAPOR BUT GRADUALLY ASCENDING TILL THEY CAUGHT THE SUNLIGHT WHICH RAN IN SHARP TOUCHES OF RUDDY COLOR ALONG THE ANGULAR CRAGS AND PIERCED IN LONG LEVEL RAYS
HE GAVE HIM THE WATER ONLY PRAY DON'T DRINK IT ALL SAID GLUCK BUT THE OLD MAN DRANK A GREAT DEAL AND GAVE HIM BACK THE BOTTLE TWO THIRDS EMPTY THEN HE BADE HIM GOOD SPEED
SCARCELY FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE HIM HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO BREATHE AND SPRANG ON TO COMPLETE HIS TASK AT THIS INSTANT A FAINT CRY FELL ON HIS EAR
THERE SEEMED A CURIOUS EXPRESSION ABOUT ALL THEIR OUTLINES A PERPETUAL RESEMBLANCE TO LIVING FEATURES DISTORTED AND SCORNFUL
IT WAS A FAIR CHILD STRETCHED NEARLY LIFELESS ON THE ROCK ITS BREAST HEAVING WITH THIRST ITS EYES CLOSED AND ITS LIPS PARCHED AND BURNING HANS EYED IT DELIBERATELY
AND MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO AND TRY HIS FORTUNE WITH THE GOLDEN RIVER THE LITTLE KING LOOKED VERY KIND THOUGHT HE I DON'T THINK HE WILL TURN ME INTO A BLACK STONE SO HE WENT TO THE PRIEST
SO THAT HIS BARNS BECAME FULL OF CORN AND HIS HOUSE OF TREASURE AND FOR HIM THE RIVER HAD ACCORDING TO THE DWARF'S PROMISE BECOME A RIVER OF GOLD
WHOSE LIDS WOULD SHUT SO THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO SING BYE SWEET BABY BYE WITH NO STARING EYES TO SPOIL THE ILLUSION WHAT HEAPS SHE KNOWS MORE THAN TEACHER I DO BELIEVE
SHE SAID STOOPING TO WIPE AWAY THE GREAT DROPS THAT KEPT ROLLING DOWN THE BROWN CHEEK HALF HIDDEN IN HER DRESS BUT BEN PUT HIS ARM OVER HIS FACE AND SOBBED OUT WITH A FRESH BURST OF GRIEF
AND HE AGAIN LOOKED DOWN TO THE FLASK AT HIS SIDE IT WAS HALF EMPTY BUT THERE WAS MUCH MORE THAN THREE DROPS IN IT HE STOPPED TO OPEN IT AND AGAIN AS HE DID SO SOMETHING MOVED IN THE PATH ABOVE HIM
NO ONE SAW HOW PITIFULLY HER EYES RESTED ON BEN'S HAPPY FACE WHEN THE LETTERS WERE PUT AWAY AND NO ONE MINDED THE NEW GENTLENESS IN HER MANNER AS SHE CAME BACK TO THE TABLE
SO KIND SO VERY KIND WAS SHE TO THEM ALL THAT WHEN AFTER AN HOUR OF MERRY PLAY SHE TOOK HER BROTHER IN TO BED THE THREE WHO REMAINED FELL TO PRAISING HER ENTHUSIASTICALLY
BUT SCHWARTZ WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE FINED FOR BREAKING THE PEACE AND HAVING DRUNK OUT HIS LAST PENNY THE EVENING BEFORE WAS THROWN INTO PRISON TILL HE SHOULD PAY WHEN HANS HEARD THIS
THROUGH THEIR FRINGES OF SPEARLIKE PINE FAR ABOVE SHOT UP RED SPLINTERED MASSES OF CASTELLATED ROCK
OR SUDDEN SHRIEKS RESEMBLING THOSE OF HUMAN VOICES IN DISTRESS OR PAIN THE ICE WAS BROKEN INTO THOUSANDS OF CONFUSED SHAPES BUT NONE HANS THOUGHT LIKE THE ORDINARY FORMS OF SPLINTERED ICE
WHEN HE HAD CLIMBED FOR AN HOUR HE GOT DREADFULLY THIRSTY AND WAS GOING TO DRINK LIKE HIS BROTHERS WHEN HE SAW AN OLD MAN COMING DOWN THE PATH ABOVE HIM LOOKING VERY FEEBLE AND LEANING ON A STAFF
AND AT THE TOP OF THE CATARACT OF THE GOLDEN RIVER ARE STILL TO BE SEEN TWO BLACK STONES ROUND WHICH THE WATERS HOWL MOURNFULLY EVERY DAY AT SUNSET AND THESE STONES ARE STILL CALLED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE VALLEY
AND THE RAYS BEAT INTENSELY UPON THE STEEP PATH WHILE THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE WAS MOTIONLESS AND PENETRATED WITH HEAT INTENSE THIRST WAS SOON ADDED TO THE BODILY FATIGUE WITH WHICH HANS WAS NOW AFFLICTED
MUTTERED BEN HASTILY TURNING BACK TO THE CHEERFUL PICTURE OF THE THREE HAPPY HORSES IN THE FIELD STANDING KNEE DEEP AMONG THE GRASS AS THEY PREPARE TO DRINK AT THE WIDE STREAM
AND GLUCK CLIMBED TO THE BRINK OF THE GOLDEN RIVER AND ITS WAVES WERE AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL AND AS BRILLIANT AS THE SUN
CRUEL SAID THE DWARF THEY POURED UNHOLY WATER INTO MY STREAM DO YOU SUPPOSE I'M GOING TO ALLOW THAT WHY SAID GLUCK I AM SURE SIR
BUT AS HE RAISED THE FLASK HE SAW A LITTLE CHILD LYING PANTING BY THE ROADSIDE
AND SET OFF VERY EARLY FOR THE MOUNTAINS
IF I WERE TO TELL YOU THAT HE WAS NEVER COMING BACK COULD YOU BEAR IT I GUESS I COULD BUT YOU DON'T MEAN IT OH MA'AM HE ISN'T DEAD CRIED BEN WITH A CRY THAT MADE HER HEART ACHE
HOW LONG SHE PLAYED MISS CELIA NEVER MINDED BUT WHEN SHE STOLE OUT TO SEE IF BEN HAD GONE SHE FOUND THAT OTHER FRIENDS EVEN KINDER THAN HERSELF
HE OPENED THE FLASK AND WAS RAISING IT TO HIS LIPS WHEN HIS EYE FELL ON AN OBJECT LYING ON THE ROCK BESIDE HIM HE THOUGHT IT MOVED IT WAS A SMALL DOG
BECAUSE NOT ONLY THE RIVER WAS NOT TURNED INTO GOLD BUT ITS WATERS SEEMED MUCH DIMINISHED IN QUANTITY YET HE OBEYED HIS FRIEND THE DWARF AND DESCENDED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS TOWARDS THE TREASURE VALLEY
AS HE SPOKE THE FIGURE OF THE DWARF BECAME INDISTINCT
HE WAS MUCH DELIGHTED AND DETERMINED TO SET OUT IMMEDIATELY FOR THE GOLDEN RIVER HOW TO GET THE HOLY WATER WAS THE QUESTION HE WENT TO THE PRIEST
AS THEY PUT THINGS TO RIGHTS BEFORE TAKING LEAVE SHE'S LIKE THE GOOD FAIRIES IN THE BOOKS AND HAS ALL SORTS OF NICE PRETTY THINGS IN HER HOUSE SAID BETTY ENJOYING A LAST HUG OF THE FASCINATING DOLL
AND THE DWARF SHOOK THEM INTO THE FLASK WHICH GLUCK HELD IN HIS HAND CAST THESE INTO THE RIVER HE SAID AND DESCEND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS INTO THE TREASURE VALLEY AND SO GOOD SPEED
ITS TAIL DISAPPEARED ITS EARS BECAME LONG LONGER SILKY GOLDEN ITS NOSE BECAME VERY RED ITS EYES BECAME VERY TWINKLING IN THREE SECONDS THE DOG WAS GONE
SEEMED TO THROW HIS BLOOD INTO A FEVER THE NOISE OF THE HILL CATARACTS SOUNDED LIKE MOCKERY IN HIS EARS THEY WERE ALL DISTANT AND HIS THIRST INCREASED EVERY MOMENT ANOTHER HOUR PASSED
HE HAD NO MONEY AND WAS OBLIGED TO GO AND HIRE HIMSELF AGAIN TO THE GOLDSMITH WHO WORKED HIM VERY HARD AND GAVE HIM VERY LITTLE MONEY
THEN HE WENT ON FOR ANOTHER HOUR
THE DISCOVERY OF THE TOTAL LOSS OF THEIR LAST PIECE OF PLATE HAD THE EFFECT OF SOBERING THEM JUST ENOUGH TO ENABLE THEM TO STAND OVER GLUCK BEATING HIM VERY STEADILY FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
NO I BROUGHT THE BOOK BUT IN THE HURRY OF MY TEA PARTY FORGOT TO UNPACK IT I'LL HUNT IT UP TO NIGHT REMIND ME THORNY THERE NOW I'VE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING TOO
WITH THE CONSTANT GUSH AND ROAR OF THE CONCEALED WATERS THESE PAINFUL CIRCUMSTANCES INCREASED UPON HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE ICE CRASHED AND YAWNED INTO FRESH CHASMS AT HIS FEET
WITH HERE AND THERE A STREAK OF SUNLIT SNOW TRACED DOWN THEIR CHASMS LIKE A LINE OF FORKED LIGHTNING AND FAR BEYOND AND FAR ABOVE ALL THESE FAINTER THAN THE MORNING CLOUD BUT PURER AND CHANGELESS
TOTTERING SPIRES NODDED AROUND HIM AND FELL THUNDERING ACROSS HIS PATH AND THOUGH HE HAD REPEATEDLY FACED THESE DANGERS ON THE MOST TERRIFIC GLACIERS AND IN THE WILDEST WEATHER
HE SAW A LITTLE DOG LYING ON THE ROCKS GASPING FOR BREATH JUST AS HANS HAD SEEN IT ON THE DAY OF HIS ASCENT AND GLUCK STOPPED AND LOOKED AT IT AND THEN AT THE GOLDEN RIVER NOT FIVE HUNDRED YARDS ABOVE HIM
POOR BEASTIE SAID GLUCK IT'LL BE DEAD WHEN I COME DOWN AGAIN IF I DON'T HELP IT THEN HE LOOKED CLOSER AND CLOSER AT IT AND ITS EYE TURNED ON HIM SO MOURNFULLY
IT WAS TWENTY TIMES WORSE FOR HIM WHO WAS NEITHER SO STRONG NOR SO PRACTICED ON THE MOUNTAINS HE HAD SEVERAL VERY BAD FALLS LOST HIS BASKET AND BREAD AND WAS VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED AT THE STRANGE NOISES UNDER THE ICE
AT THE EXPIRATION OF WHICH PERIOD THEY DROPPED INTO A COUPLE OF CHAIRS AND REQUESTED TO KNOW WHAT HE HAD GOT TO SAY FOR HIMSELF GLUCK TOLD THEM HIS STORY OF WHICH OF COURSE THEY DID NOT BELIEVE A WORD
AND RETURNED HOME IN TRIUMPH NEXT MORNING HE GOT UP BEFORE THE SUN ROSE PUT THE HOLY WATER INTO A STRONG FLASK AND TWO BOTTLES OF WINE AND SOME MEAT IN A BASKET SLUNG THEM OVER HIS BACK
WE ARE ORPHANS TOO AND WE WILL STAND BY ONE ANOTHER TILL A STRONGER FRIEND COMES TO HELP US SAID MISS CELIA WITH SUCH A MIXTURE OF RESOLUTION AND TENDERNESS IN HER VOICE THAT BEN FELT COMFORTED AT ONCE
YOU SHALL STAY HERE AND NO ONE SHALL TAKE YOU AWAY AGAINST YOUR WILL I CALLED YOU MY BOY IN PLAY NOW YOU SHALL BE MY BOY IN EARNEST THIS SHALL BE YOUR HOME AND THORNY YOUR BROTHER
THEN THE TROUT HAD FOUND HIMSELF CAUGHT AND THEY HAD SEEN THE FISHERMAN'S ROD BENT ALMOST DOUBLE AS THE TROUT DASHED TO AND FRO AND AT LAST THEY HAD SEEN THE FISHERMAN SLIP A NET INTO THE WATER
IN A FEW DAYS SHE BOWED ASSENT THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS WERE AGREED UPON
OF A TRUTH I TOOK REFUGE IN THY DWELLING TO SAVE ME FROM SLAUGHTER AND I HAVE COME TO THEE SEEKING THY PROTECTION AND ON NOWISE COVETING THY HOUSE NOR SHALL ANY MISCHIEF BETIDE THEE FROM ME TO MAKE THEE LEAVE THY HOME
AND WHO SHOWETH NO CONSTANCY IN FRIENDSHIP THE MOUSE REPLIED EVEN SO O MY FRIEND AND I DELIGHT IN THEE AND IN THEY NEIGHBORHOOD BUT WHAT BE THE MOTIVE OF THIS SPEECH
THE MAN THAT THEY SAW MOST OFTEN WAS A MAN CALLED BEARDY NED BECAUSE THOUGH HE WAS ONLY A YOUNGISH MAN HE HAD A SANDY COLOURED BEARD AND THEY WERE ALWAYS VERY SORRY FOR HIM
AND OF A TRUTH SHE HATH DONE US
PEOPLE LIKE CLERGYMEN AND LARGE EMPLOYERS OFTEN USED TO TELL HIM THAT HE OUGHT TO SETTLE DOWN BUT WHY SHOULD HE SETTLE DOWN HE ASKED SO LONG AS THERE WAS ONLY LIZ AND SHE COULD SLEEP IN HIS ARMS AS SNUG AS SNUG
WHERE THE BANK WAS HIGH AND THERE WAS A LITTLE BEACH FROM THE TOP OF THE BANK A GREAT TREE HAD FALLEN WITH ITS ROOTS STICKING UP IN THE AIR
THAT'S THE CHIEF THING IS IT QUITE SAFE ASKED CUTHBERT IT SEEMS RATHER QUEER I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT'S LIKE SAID BEARDY NED IT'S LIKE A DREAM OR RATHER IT'S NOT LIKE A DREAM SO MUCH AS WAKING UP FROM A DREAM YOU SEES THE TREES AND THINGS ALL KIND OF MISTY
AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO CHOKE AND TAKE DEEP BREATHS JUST THEN TOO BEARDY NED CAME CRASHING THROUGH THE REEDS WITH GREAT STRIDES FOR CUTHBERT HAD SHOUTED AS LOUD AS HE COULD JUST BEFORE HE PLUNGED INTO THE POOL NED'S FACE HAD TURNED GREY
AND HATH EATEN HIS FILL OF IT HE AND HIS FAMILY AND HATH LEFT MUCH EVERY LIVING BEING HATH EATEN OF IT AND IF THOU TAKE OF IT IN THEY TURN THOU ART WORTHIER THEREOF THAN ANY OTHER
BUT I'VE USED IT A LOT AND AFTER YOU'VE BLOWED IT OUT AND IT'S TAKEN YOU WITH IT IT GOES ON BURNING WHEN YOU COME BACK IT'S AN INCH SHORTER AN INCH SHORTER EVERY TIME AND THIS HERE BIT IS THE LAST BIT AS'LL EVER TAKE ANYONE TO IN BETWEEN LAND
AND KNOW O MY FRIEND THAT THOU ART MY NEIGHBOUR
AND THE DUSKY MEADOWS BUT THEY LOOKED JUST LIKE DREAM STICKS AND A DREAM FIRE
AND THE SUBTLEST IN JEST
IS LORD FREDERICK THE MAN YOU APPROVE FOR YOUR HUSBAND UPON THIS CLOSE INTERROGATION SHE DISCOVERED AN EMBARRASSMENT BEYOND ANY SHE HAD EVER YET BETRAYED AND FAINTLY REPLIED NO HE IS NOT
WERE HER GREED AND HEEDLESSNESS OF CONSEQUENCES THEN SAID THE SULTAN O SHAHRAZAD BY
IN A CAVE OF A CERTAIN MOUNTAIN AND AS OFTEN AS A CUB WAS BORN TO HIM AND GREW STOUT
LEFT THE CUB ALIVE AND BRED IT BY HIS SIDE
IT RAN FOR ALMOST A QUARTER OF A MILE THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF A SORT OF WOOD IT WAS UNDER THE ROOTS OF SOME OF THESE TREES
MISS WOODLEY JUST THEN ENTERED HER APARTMENT AND SHE FOUND HERSELF SO MUCH A COWARD
DORRIFORTH SAW HER CONCERN UPON THIS LAST TRIFLING OCCASION WITH A SECRET PLEASURE AND AN ADMIRATION THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE EXCITED SHE ONCE INSINUATED TO HIM TO BE A MEDIATOR BETWEEN THEM
AND STAND BEFORE ME EVEN AS THE THRALL STANDETH BEFORE HIS LORD QUOTH THE FOX O STUPID DULLARD WHO SEEKEST A VAIN THING I MARVEL AT THY FOLLY AND THY FRONT OF BRASS IN THAT
I SHOULD BE PARTIAL IF I BLAMED YOU MORE THAN HIM INDEED WHEN YOU TAKE THE LIBERTY TO CONDEMN HIM HIS CHARACTER MAKES THE FREEDOM APPEAR IN A MORE SERIOUS LIGHT THAN WHEN HE COMPLAINS OF YOU
SOMETIMES A FISHERMAN WOULD COME QUIETLY ALONG AND KNEEL DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND AFTER HE HAD SEEN A TROUT RISE WOULD OPEN A LITTLE BOX AND TAKE OUT A FLY LIKE THE ONE THAT THE TROUT HAD EATEN BUT THIS WOULD BE A SHAM FLY
MISTER SANDFORD FINDING HIS FRIEND DORRIFORTH FREQUENTLY PERPLEXED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS WARD AND HE HIMSELF THINKING HER INCORRIGIBLE
A PRESENTIMENT THAT HER GUARDIAN WAS GOING TO UPBRAID HER
DORRIFORTH WAS CONFUSED
AT A DINNER GIVEN BY LORD ELMWOOD SIR EDWARD WAS ANNOUNCED AS AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR MISS MILNER DID NOT SUPPOSE HIM SUCH
THE TWO PARTIES WOULD OCCASIONALLY JOIN AND OF COURSE SANDFORD AND SHE AT THOSE TIMES MET YET SO DISTANT
NAMED LORD FREDERICK LAWNLY AS BEING HOURLY EXPECTED AT HIS UNCLE'S THE COLOUR SPREAD OVER SIR EDWARD'S FACE DORRIFORTH WAS CONFOUNDED AND MISTER SANDFORD LOOKED ENRAGED DID LORD FREDERICK TELL YOU HE SHOULD BE DOWN
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO WAKE UP THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE IN IN BETWEEN LAND LIZ STIRRED AGAIN AND HE SHIFTED HER ON HIS KNEES A LITTLE
IN WHICH MISTER SANDFORD WAS TREATED AND MISS WOODLEY TURNED TO HIM WITH A BENEVOLENT SMILE UPON HER FACE HOPING TO SET HIM AN EXAMPLE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SHOULD RECEIVE THE REPROACH HER GOOD WISHES DID NOT SUCCEED
AND DEEM NOT THAT ALLAH WILL AGAIN GIVE THEE POSSESSION OF ME
SHINING WITH WHITENESS AND THE WOMAN SITTING AT WATCH AND WARD
AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD GO FAR AWAY AND NOT COME BACK FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS
DRAWING TOWARDS HER HOUSE WHERE LORD ELMWOOD WAS INVITED TO DINE
THAT I SHALL NEVER ENTER A HOUSE IN WHICH YOU ARE THE MISTRESS NOR ANY HOUSE I AM CERTAIN MISTER SANDFORD BUT IN WHICH YOU ARE YOURSELF THE MASTER
THE CROW AT ONCE FLEW UP TO THE TREE TOP BUT THE CAT ABODE CONFOUNDED AND SAID TO THE CROW O MY FRIEND HAST THOU NO DEVICE TO SAVE ME EVEN AS ALL MY HOPE IS IN THEE REPLIED THE CROW
BUT I KNOW YOU DO IT FOR HER GOOD WELL MISS MILNER CRIED DORRIFORTH AND THE MOST CUTTING THING HE COULD SAY SINCE I FIND MY PROPOSAL OF THE COUNTRY HAS PUT YOU OUT OF HUMOUR I SHALL MENTION IT NO MORE
HE WILL NOT THEN SO EVIDENTLY FOLLOW
BUT I HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK YOU AND TO WHICH I REQUIRE A SERIOUS AND UNEQUIVOCAL ANSWER DO YOU EXPECT LORD FREDERICK IN THE COUNTRY WITHOUT HESITATION SHE REPLIED I DO ONE MORE QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK MADAM
SANDFORD ASKED OF DORRIFORTH TO WHICH HE REPLIED NO BUT I HOPE MISTER SANDFORD YOU WILL PERMIT ME TO KNOW SAID MISS MILNER FOR AS SHE NOW MEANT TO TORMENT HIM BY WHAT SHE SAID
AND THESE WERE HANGING FROM STICKS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FIRE AND HE HAD WRAPPED HER IN A BLANKET AND SOON SHE WAS FAST ASLEEP LYING ON HIS KNEES AS HE SAT AND SMOKED HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING A LOT BUT AT LAST HE LOOKED AT CUTHBERT
THERE GOES A FOX HE SAID HE SUCKED HIS PIPE FOR A MOMENT IN SILENCE THE SOUND OF THE FIRE WAS LIKE SOMEBODY TALKING TO THEM
OUT OF HER HOLE AND CARRY IT FORTH AND LAY IT BACK UPON THE REST THE WOMAN STOOD BY AND SEEING THE ICHNEUMON DO THUS SAID TO HERSELF
AND AS I AM DEBARRED FROM THAT RESOURCE WHAT CAN I DO BUT STAND BEFORE HIM LIKE A GUILTY CREATURE ACKNOWLEDGING MY FAULTS SHE AGAIN ENTREATED HER FRIEND TO GO WITH HER BUT ON A POSITIVE REFUSAL FROM THE IMPROPRIETY OF SUCH AN INTRUSION
FOR BEARDY NED IN SPITE OF HIS GREAT TROUBLE WAS ALWAYS FULL OF A SECRET HAPPINESS AND HE HAD MADE THIS LITTLE SONG OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD THAT HE USED TO SING EVERY TWO OR THREE HOURS THE WICKEDEST GIRL THERE WAS THE WICKEDEST GIRL THERE IS
AND SHE BURST INTO TEARS DORRIFORTH INSTEAD OF BEING CONCERNED AS HE USUALLY WAS AT SEEING HER UNEASY APPEARED ON THE PRESENT OCCASION PROVOKED HE THOUGHT HER WEEPING WAS A NEW REPROACH TO HIS FRIEND MISTER SANDFORD
ELMWOOD HOUSE OR RATHER CASTLE THE SEAT OF LORD ELMWOOD WAS ONLY A FEW MILES DISTANT FROM THIS RESIDENCE
HE GAVE IT TO CUTHBERT DO YOU WANT TO GO THERE HE SAID YOU'VE SAVED MY LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE AND YOU'VE ONLY TO SAY THE WORD
HE FELT AS IF HE COULD JUMP OVER THE HIGHEST STAR
HE HAD NO LONGER ANY OBJECTION TO MAKE A REPLY AND THEREFORE ANSWERED NO MADAM IF IT DEPENDED UPON MY PERMISSION YOU SHOULD NOT KNOW
ANSWERED THE CROW THOU HAST MY LEAVE TO LET ME HEAR THY COMMUNICATION
OF THE GOODLINESS OF TRUE FRIENDSHIP
AND YET TEMPTING THEM TO FOLLOW
AM I THE MASTER HERE YOUR SERVANTS REPLIED SHE LOOKING AT THE COMPANY WILL NOT TELL YOU SO BUT I DO YOU CONDESCEND MISTER SANDFORD CRIED MISSUS HORTON
WHEN IT WAS THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING
CUTHBERT'S HAND WAS SHAKING A LITTLE BUT HE BLEW OUT THE CANDLE AND THEN FOR A MOMENT HE SAW NOTHING AT ALL BUT HE FELT SOMETHING HE FELT AS IF HE'D BEEN ASLEEP FOR EVER AND EVER AND HAD SUDDENLY OPENED HIS EYES HE FELT AS IF HE COULD DO ANYTHING HE WAS SO STRONG
AND HIS FACE HAD ASSUMED
BUT AS SOON AS THE BLOODSUCKER WAS AWARE OF THE SEARCH HE TURNED TO FLEE AND COMING
SHE IMMEDIATELY EXPERIENCED A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE HAD NOT ACTED PROPERLY AT LORD ELMWOOD'S
FOR I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SINCE MISS FENTON AND MISTER SANDFORD CAME TO TOWN I HAVE RECEIVED ONE TESTIMONY OF YOUR ESTEEM HAD THESE WORDS BEEN UTTERED WITH PLEASANTRY THEY MIGHT HAVE PASSED WITHOUT OBSERVATION
BUT AT LAST HE HAD SWUM ACROSS IT AND MADE A GRAB AT A PIECE OF LIZ'S FROCK JUST UNDER THE SURFACE HE PULLED THIS HARD AND TRIED TO GO ON SWIMMING WITH HIS OTHER ARM AND BOTH LEGS
THE RIGHT OF NEIGHBOURLINESS AND THE RIGHT OF AL ISLAM
TOLD OF A FLEA AND A MOUSE AND WHICH BEARETH OUT WHAT I HAVE SAID TO THEE ASKED THE CROW HOW SO AND THE FOX ANSWERED
ALSO THERE BE IMPLANTED IN MY BREAST A STORE OF LOVE TO THEE
IS MY YOUNG DAUGHTER LIZ HE ONLY MEANT IT IN FUN OF COURSE AND WHEN LIZ WAS RUNNING ABOUT HE WOULD SHOUT IT AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE BUT WHEN SHE WAS SLEEPY HE WOULD ONLY CROON IT UNTIL HER EYELIDS BEGAN TO DROP
ENTERED IT WHEN THE MOUSE SAW HIM SHE SAID TO HIM WHAT BRINGETH THEE IN TO ME THOU WHO ART NOT OF MY NATURE NOR OF MY KIND AND WHO CANST NOT BE ASSURED OF SAFETY FROM VIOLENCE OR OF NOT
A FRIEND IN NEED IS HE WHO EVER TRUE
IT WAS AGREED THE ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE INSTEAD OF RECEIVING THIS ABRUPT PROPOSAL WITH UNEASINESS MISS MILNER TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL PRESENT IMMEDIATELY CONSENTED
CAWING AND CRYING OUT FURTHERMORE HE WENT UP TO ONE OF THE DOGS AND FLAPPED HIS WINGS IN HIS FACE
WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF THE STUDY SHE OPENED IT WITH A TREPIDATION SHE COULD HARDLY ACCOUNT FOR
AND SAW THE BIRD FLYING NEAR THE GROUND AND LIGHTING
WHILE HE LOOKED AT CUTHBERT HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED HE SAID WHERE CANDLES GOES TO WHERE THEY GOES TO WHEN THEY GOES OUT NO I DON'T THINK SO SAID CUTHBERT WHERE DO THEY GO TO
FOR I UNDERSTAND THE SEAT TO WHICH YOUR GUARDIAN MEANS TO GO
GUARDIAN AND FRIEND ARE TWO DIFFERENT BEINGS
YET THOUGH MISS MILNER AT THOSE TIMES WAS SOFTENED INTO MELANCHOLY SHE BY NO MEANS APPEARED UNHAPPY
FOR HE CAN DO IN SUCH MATTERS WHAT I CANNOT SO HE DREW NEAR THE CROW'S HOME
AND HOW WELL SAITH THE POET
AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LORD FREDERICK SAID MISS WOODLEY TO HERSELF BUT HER UNDERSTANDING COMPELS HER TO SEE HIS FAULTS
WITH ALL GOOD AND THEN SHALT THOU SEE AND PRAISE THE ISSUE OF MY WORDS AND WHEN THE MOUSE HEARD THE SPEECH OF THE FLEA AND SHAHRAZAD
WHEN THE MISFORTUNE IS BUT IDEAL AND MISS MILNER FOUND INFINITE GRATIFICATION IN BEING TOLD
BUT THEN WHY ENCOURAGE HIM TO FOLLOW YOU HITHER MISS MILNER WHY COMMIT A THOUSAND FOLLIES SHE REPLIED IN TEARS EVERY HOUR OF MY LIFE YOU THEN PROMOTE THE HOPES OF LORD FREDERICK WITHOUT ONE SERIOUS INTENTION OF COMPLETING THEM
WHICH AM I TO BELIEVE WHICH YOU PLEASE WAS HER ANSWER WHILE SHE DISCOVERED AN INSULTED DIGNITY
EXCUSE WHAT YOU MY DEAR RETURNED MISS WOODLEY
IT WAS HARDLY MORE THAN A BUBBLY TRICKLE BUT LOWER DOWN IT GREW WIDER AND WIDER AND RAN BETWEEN THE REEDS AT THE EDGES OF THE MEADOWS
WITH MY FANGS FOR THOU KNOWEST WE EXCEED NOT THAT RECOMPENSE SO SAYING SHE GAVE HIM A BITE WHEREOF HE DIED AND I LIKEN THEE O DULLARD TO THE SERPENT IN HER DEALINGS WITH THAT MAN HAST THOU NOT HEARD WHAT THE POET SAITH
AND UPROOT THE VINES FROM BASE
AND WAS SHOWING CUTHBERT HOW TO COOK TROUT IT WAS BEGINNING TO GET DARK NOW AND THE STARS WERE SHINING AND THE FLAMES OF THE FIRE MADE THE RIVER LOOK LIKE INK BUT THEY WERE SO SHELTERED UNDER THE HIGH BANK THAT THEY MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN AT HOME
OR CONSENT TO BECOME HIS WIFE IN ANSWER TO THE ALTERNATIVE THUS OFFERED SHE APPEARED AVERSE TO BOTH PROPOSITIONS AND YET CAME TO NO EXPLANATION WHY BUT LEFT HER GUARDIAN AT THE END OF THE CONFERENCE
EITHER TO EXHORT HER TO HER DUTY OR TO WARN HER AGAINST HER FOLLY SHE WAS EVEN IN PERFECT GOOD HUMOUR WITH MISS FENTON AND ADDED FRIENDSHIP TO HOSPITALITY
MISWEEN SMOOTH FEELS THE VIPER TO THE TOUCH AND GLIDES WITH GRACE YET HIDES SHE DEADLIEST VENENE
IN A FEW DAYS THEY DEPARTED MISSUS HORTON
KNEW THAT SHE WAS ON THE WATCH FOR HER AND SAID IN HER MIND VERILY THIS AFFAIR IS LIKE TO END BLAMEABLY AND SORE I FEAR ME THIS WOMAN IS ON THE LOOK OUT FOR ME AND FORTUNE IS NO FRIEND
AND HE HAD WANDERED ABOUT EVER SINCE DOING ALL SORTS OF ODD JOBS SOMETIMES HE HELPED THE FARMERS GET THEIR HAY IN OR THE GAMEKEEPERS TRAP STOATS AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD CHOP WOOD
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN TAKING OFF SOME PART OF HER DRESS WHEN DORRIFORTH'S SERVANT CAME TO ACQUAINT HER THAT HIS MASTER WAS ALONE IN HIS STUDY AND BEGGED TO SPEAK WITH HER
AND FINDING HIS BODY SOFT AND BEING THIRSTY DRANK OF HIS BLOOD
AT LEAST FIX THE TIME YOU MEAN TO GO DURING THE AUTUMN AND BE FIRM TO YOUR DETERMINATION BUT IN THE AUTUMN REPLIED DORRIFORTH
EVERY RIVULET INTO A STAGNATED POOL AND EVERY SINGING BIRD INTO A CROAKING RAVEN
SHE SECRETLY TRIUMPHED IN THE MORTIFICATION SHE HOPED THAT MISTER SANDFORD WOULD RECEIVE FROM HER OBEDIENT BEHAVIOUR THE NEWS OF THIS INTENDED JOURNEY WAS OF COURSE SOON MADE PUBLIC THERE IS A SECRET CHARM IN BEING PITIED
BUT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PERIOD RESENTMENT FLEW TO MISS MILNER'S FACE AND SHE DARTED A PIERCING LOOK AT MISTER SANDFORD WHICH MORE POINTEDLY EXPRESSED THAT SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HIM THAN IF SHE HAD SPOKEN VOLUMES IN HER USUAL STRAIN OF RAILLERY
WHILE LONDON WAS FILLED WITH HER ADMIRERS WHO LIKE HER WOULD LANGUISH IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER SOLITUDE THESE THINGS AND A THOUSAND SUCH
DIRECTED IMMEDIATELY TO HIM AND A SEVERE WORD OF HIS INSTEAD OF EXASPERATING WAS SURE TO SUBDUE HER THIS WAS THE CASE AT PRESENT HIS WORDS WOUNDED HER TO THE HEART
IT IS THAT VERY TENDERNESS WHICH FRIGHTENS ME WHICH INTIMIDATES AND STRIKES ME DUMB
AS MUCH AT A LOSS TO DECIDE UPON HER TRUE SENTIMENTS AS HE WAS BEFORE
THEN BEARDY NED FELT IN HIS POCKET AND PULLED OUT THE END OF A CANDLE IT LOOKED LIKE AN ORDINARY CANDLE
HE BIT HIS FOREHAND FOR REPENTANCE
AND THAT TO SUFFER HIMSELF TO BE MOVED BY IT WOULD BE A TACIT CONDEMNATION OF HIS FRIEND'S CONDUCT SHE UNDERSTOOD HIS THOUGHTS AND GETTING THE BETTER OF HER TEARS APOLOGISED FOR HER WEAKNESS ADDING SHE COULD NEVER BEAR WITH INDIFFERENCE AN UNJUST ACCUSATION
ALL THE DECLINING ENMITY OF MISS MILNER WAS RENEWED AT THIS BEHAVIOUR AND SUSPECTING SANDFORD AS THE INSTIGATOR OF THE VISIT SHE COULD NOT OVERCOME HER DISPLEASURE
LIZ WAS FOUR YEARS OLD NOW AND AS BROWN AS HER FATHER AND HER HAIR WAS SHORT AND CURLY LIKE A BOY'S
HE SAT BOLT UPRIGHT AND THEN LOOKING ACROSS THE POOL HE SAW A LITTLE FORM STRUGGLING IN THE DEEP WATER AND ROLLING OVER IN IT HEAD DOWNWARD AND THEN BEGINNING TO SLIP OUT OF SIGHT IT WAS LIZ WITH ALL HER CLOTHES ON SHE HAD EVIDENTLY SLIPPED DOWN THE STEEP BANK
OVERLOOKING THE VINEYARD AND STANDING THERE
AND THE FOX SAID TO HIMSELF I HAVE A MIND TO SET UP A FRIENDSHIP WITH THIS CROW AND MAKE A COMRADE OF HIM
THAT THE BIGGEST OF THE TROUT HAD THEIR NESTS WHERE FISHERMEN WITH FLIES COULDN'T REACH THEM BUT THERE WERE SOME BIG TROUT TOO THAT LIVED UNDER THE MEADOW BANKS AND USED TO PUT UP THEIR NOSES IN THE SUMMER EVENINGS
MISTER SANDFORD WHO CAME WITH LORD ELMWOOD TO THE NEIGHBOURING SEAT
OF COURSE CUTHBERT COULDN'T ALWAYS BE BOTHERED TO GO UP THE RIVER WITH THE GIRLS
FOR THE WOMAN HAD ARMED HERSELF WITH A CUDGEL AND UNABLE TO CONTAIN HERSELF RAN UP TO THE SESAME AND BEGAN TURNING IT OVER AND EATING OF IT WHEREUPON THE WOMAN SMOTE HER WITH THAT CLUB AND CLEFT HER HEAD
THREE HOURS AGO HAD THE COURAGE TO VINDICATE YOUR OWN CAUSE BEFORE A WHOLE COMPANY OF WHOM MANY WERE YOUR ADVERSARIES DO YOU WANT AN ADVOCATE BEFORE YOUR GUARDIAN ALONE WHO HAS EVER TREATED YOU WITH TENDERNESS
FOR SHE HAD REFUSED BESIDES SIR EDWARD ASHTON MANY OTHERS OF EQUAL PRETENSIONS DEPEND UPON IT THEN CRIED SANDFORD
SHE FREQUENTLY FELT CONCERNED THAT HE DID NOT SPEAK TO HER ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN TO FIND FAULT AS USUAL
AND DRANK TEA AND LIZ WHO WAS ALMOST ASLEEP HAD A CUP OF MILK AND THEN THEY ATE BISCUITS AND JAM OUT OF A POT AND BEARDY NED FILLED HIS PIPE HE HAD MADE LIZ TAKE OFF HER WET CLOTHES OF COURSE
SHE IMAGINED THAT WHAT HE SAID MIGHT BE CENSURE AND SHE CONTINUED TO TREMBLE THOUGH HE REPEATEDLY ASSURED HER THAT HE MEANT ONLY TO ADVISE NOT UPBRAID HER FOR AS TO ALL THOSE LITTLE DISPUTES BETWEEN MISTER SANDFORD AND YOU SAID HE
THE TROUBLE IS YOU SEE BEARDY NED CONTINUED THAT CANDLES WHEN THEY GOES OUT CAN'T TAKE PEOPLE WITH THEM BUT JAMES PARKINS HE'D FOUND A CANDLE THAT COULD TAKE A PERSON WITH IT AND THIS IS THE CANDLE WHEN HE FIRST GAVE IT ME TWO YEAR AGO IT WAS ABOUT EIGHT INCHES LONG
BUT NEXT MOMENT BOTH HE AND LIZ WERE LAUGHING AND CUTHBERT SWAM BACK AGAIN TO PUT ON HIS CLOTHES AND THEN HE CROSSED THE RIVER UPON A PLANK LOWER DOWN WHERE HE FOUND BEARDY NED AND LIZ WAITING FOR HIM
HER SATISFACTION WAS AS EVIDENT AS EVERY OTHER PERSON'S
SO THE FOLK LOOKED INTO THE CLEFT AND SPYING THE WOLF SET TO PELTING HIM WITH HEAVY STONES AND THEY STINTED NOT SMITING HIM WITH STONES AND STICKS AND STABBING HIM WITH SPEARS
FOR BESIDE BEARDY NED STOOD A GIRL OF NINETEEN WHO HAD BEEN PADDLING IN THE STREAM
AND THERE WAS A LOOK IN HIS EYES THAT MADE CUTHBERT FEEL ALMOST FRIGHTENED BUT WHEN HE SAW LIZ SITTING UP AND CRYING HE GAVE A SHOUT AND CAUGHT HER IN HIS ARMS THEN HE GRIPPED CUTHBERT BY THE WRIST AND CUTHBERT COULD FEEL THAT HE WAS SHAKING ALL OVER AND THEN BEARDY NED BEGAN TO CRY TOO
OR A BLUE FLY OR A FLY WITH PALE WINGS LIKE A DISTANT RAIN CLOUD FLOATING DOWN ON THE TOP OF THE WATER AND PROBABLY WONDERING WHERE IT HAD GOT TO AND THEN THEY WOULD HEAR A LITTLE NOISE LIKE GROWN UP PEOPLE MAKE WITH THE TIPS OF THEIR TONGUES AGAINST THE ROOFS OF THEIR MOUTHS
MADE OF FEATHERS AND SILK CUNNINGLY TIED ROUND A SHARP HOOK AND HE WOULD THREAD IT ON TO A PIECE OF GUT SO THIN THAT THEY COULD HARDLY SEE IT THEN HE WOULD TIE THE GUT TO A SORT OF STRING THAT WAS HANGING DOWN FROM THE POINT OF HIS FISHING ROD
JAMES PARKINS THAT WAS HIS NAME AND THERE'S NOT ANOTHER LIKE IT IN THE WHOLE WORLD AND THERE NEVER WON'T BE AGAIN
BUT THOUGH SHE HAD THE GENEROSITY TO FORGIVE AN AFFRONT SHE HAD NOT THE HUMILITY TO MAKE A CONCESSION AND SHE FORESAW THAT NOTHING LESS THAN SOME VERY HUMBLE ATONEMENT ON HER PART WOULD PREVAIL UPON THE HAUGHTY PRIEST TO BE RECONCILED
HE HAD PUT A COUPLE OF BLANKETS THERE AND AN OLD WATERPROOF AND STANDING ON THE BEACH WERE A CUP AND KETTLE
AND YOU SEES EM QUARRELLING AND THE LIKE AND GRIEVING
AND INDEED I SHOULD LOVE TO WONE NEAR THEE AND I HAVE SUED FOR THINE INTIMACY TO THE END THAT WE MAY HELP EACH OTHER TO OUR SEVERAL OBJECTS AND SUCCESS SHALL SURELY WAIT UPON OUR AMITY
IT WAS STILL ONLY MAY SO THAT THE WATER WAS COLD BUT THE AIR ABOVE IT WAS WARM AND STILL AND HE WAS LYING ON THE BANK WITHOUT ANYTHING ON WHEN HE SUDDENLY HEARD A SPLASH AND A GURGLING CRY
INCITED THERETO BY LUST FOR THE RECOMPENSE AND EAGER TO FIND FAVOUR WITH HEAVEN AND SET HER IN HIS BREASTPOCKET
THEY GOES INTO THE IN BETWEEN LAND THE PLACE AS IS IN BETWEEN EVERYTHING YOU CAN SEE HOW DO I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THERE BECAUSE JAMES PARKINS SHOWED ME HOW THAT'S VERY INTERESTING SAID CUTHBERT POLITELY BUT BEARDY NED DIDN'T SEEM TO HEAR
DORRIFORTH THOUGHT HE DID KNOW AND MENTIONED LORD FREDERICK BUT SAID THAT HE HAD NO FARTHER AUTHORITY FOR THE SUPPOSITION THAN WHAT HIS OBSERVATION HAD GIVEN HIM FOR THAT EVERY EXPLANATION BOTH UPON HIS AND HER SIDE HAD BEEN EVADED TAKE HER THEN CRIED SANDFORD INTO THE COUNTRY
NOR DID HE GIVE OVER SHOUTING TILL HE WOKE THEM AND THEY SEEING HIM ALL CAME UP TO HIM IN HASTE
INTENT THEREBY REJOINED THE FOX HEAR THEN O MY FRIEND
AND THEN HE WOULD SWISH HIS ROD UNTIL THE FLY FLEW OUT STRAIGHT AND FELL UPON THE STREAM JUST AS THE REAL ONE HAD DONE SOMETIMES THEY COULD SEE A TROUT COME UP AND LOOK AT THIS FLY AND SHAKE HIS HEAD AND GO DOWN AGAIN
IGNORE NOT MY CASE AND MEN'S FEAR OF ME
THAT I FIRST SAW MY LIZ I MEAN HER MOTHER PERHAPS IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING IT WAS WHERE I FIRST SAW THIS ONE TOO
YES I'D LIKE TO HE SAID IT WOULD BE RATHER EXCITING BEARDY NED BENT FORWARD AND TOOK A STICK FROM THE FIRE HE LIT THE END OF THE CANDLE BETWEEN CUTHBERT'S FINGERS NOW BLOW IT OUT HE SAID AND YOU'LL GO OUT WITH IT IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT YOU'LL BE BACK IN A TICK
THIS IS A CONDUCT AGAINST WHICH IT IS MY DUTY TO GUARD YOU AND YOU SHALL NO LONGER DECEIVE EITHER HIM OR YOURSELF
AND THE CARE OF SO DANGEROUS A PERSON GIVEN INTO OTHER HANDS DORRIFORTH ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROPRIETY OF THIS ADVICE BUT LAMENTED THE DIFFICULTY OF PLEASING HIS WARD AS TO THE QUALITY OF HER LOVER
YET SHE WAS CONFIRMED FROM THESE INCREASED SYMPTOMS
BUT I WILL NOT CEASE MY WATCHING TILL HE FALL INTO MY HANDS AND I FIND OUT WHO IS THE THIEF THE ICHNEUMON GUESS WHAT WAS IN HER MIND SO SHE WENT TO THE MOUSE AND SAID TO HER O
MISS MILNER DID NOT LIKE MISTER SANDFORD
AND DO THEE ALL MANNER OF KINDNESS
BEHOLD I HAVE SAVED THEE FROM THAT THOU FEAREDEST AND SOUGHTEST TO FLY REPLIED SHE
THE AIR OF THE COUNTRY HAS AFFECTED THE LADY ALREADY BUT IT IS A COMFORTABLE THING CONTINUED HE THAT IN THE VARIETY OF HUMOURS TO WHICH SOME WOMEN ARE EXPOSED THEY CANNOT BE UNIFORM EVEN IN DECEIT DECEIT CRIED MISS MILNER
AN ESTATE BELONGING TO AN UNCLE OF LORD FREDERICK'S
AND HE WAS ABLE TO STAND UP AND LIFT HER OUT OF THE POOL SHE WAS QUITE PALE AND THE WATER WAS POURING FROM HER MOUTH AND HER EYES WERE STARING AS IF THEY COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING HE SCRAMBLED UP THE BANK GRAZING HIS KNEES
BUT ALL TIMES ARE NOT GOOD FOR FUNNING AND JESTING THE FOX REPLIED O IGNORAMUS IN GOOD SOOTH JESTING HATH A LIMIT WHICH THE JESTER MUST NOT OVERPASS
BEARDY NED TOOK HIM BY THE SHOULDER COME ALONG HE SAID AND HAVE SUPPER WITH US HE WAS CARRYING LIZ AND STICKING OUT OF ONE OF HIS POCKETS CUTHBERT COULD SEE THE TAILS OF A BRACE OF TROUT AND PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO A BEND OF THE STREAM
BUT VERY OFTEN THERE WOULD BE NO FISHERMEN AT ALL AND THEY WOULD SEE NOBODY FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND HEAR NOTHING BUT THE CRIES OF THE RIVER BIRDS AND THE SUCK SUCK OF THE FEEDING TROUT
INSTEAD OF THE ANGER WITH WHICH HE WAS PREPARED TO BEGIN HIS VOICE INVOLUNTARILY SOFTENED AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE SAID HE BEGAN
I WOULD FROM A SELF INTERESTED MOTIVE MISTER SANDFORD THAT I MIGHT HAVE A GREATER RESPECT FOR YOU SOME OF THE COMPANY LAUGHED MISSUS HORTON COUGHED MISS WOODLEY BLUSHED LORD ELMWOOD SNEERED DORRIFORTH FROWNED
SO THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT THAT I DO A FAIR DEED WHEREBY I MAY MANIFEST MY INNOCENCE AND WASH OUT ALL THE ILL DOINGS I HAVE DONE
STANDING OVER THE SPOT WHERE HIS FOE HAD BEEN SLAIN SAW THE WOLF DEAD SO HE WAGGED HIS HEAD FOR VERY JOYANCE AND BEGAN TO RECITE THESE COUPLETS
AT HER'S WAS SO SCRUPULOUSLY EXACT IN THE OBSERVANCE OF HIS WORD NEVER TO ENTER A HOUSE OF MISS MILNER'S THAT HE WOULD NOT EVEN CALL UPON HIS FRIEND DORRIFORTH THERE BUT IN THEIR WALKS AND AT LORD ELMWOOD'S
THERE AIN'T NO TIME THERE NOT AS WE RECKONS TIME BUT ONCE YOU'VE BEEN THERE
CUTHBERT COULDN'T MOVE BUT A MOMENT LATER HE WAS IN THE WATER AND SWIMMING ACROSS THE POOL AS FAST AS HE COULD AND FASTER THAN HE HAD EVER SWUM BEFORE HE PRAYED TO GOD THAT HE MIGHT BE IN TIME THE POOL HAD NEVER LOOKED SO WIDE
AND TAKING MEDICINE THEY ALL SEEMED TOO STUPID EVEN TO BOTHER ABOUT HE FELT LIKE A PRISONER JUST SET FREE HE KNEW THAT HE WAS REALLY FREE AND THAT NOTHING COULD EVER HURT HIM THEN HE BEGAN TO SEE THINGS
OF VERY TRUTH IT BEHOVETH BRETHREN IN CASE OF NEED TO CAST ABOUT FOR A DEVICE
THEY USED TO LIE ON THE BANK AND KEEP VERY STILL AND WATCH THE TROUT HAVING THEIR EVENING MEAL THEY
AND IF LORD FREDERICK SHOULD NOT FOLLOW THERE IS AN END OF YOUR SUSPICIONS I SHALL NOT EASILY PREVAIL UPON MISS MILNER TO LEAVE TOWN REPLIED HE WHILE IT IS IN THE HIGHEST FASHION
SHE WAS JUST NINETEEN SHE'D BEEN PADDLING IN THE STREAM I CALLED OUT TO HER AND SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AT ME SHE WAS IN AN OLD FROCK BUT SHE LOOKED QUITE THE LADY HER EYES WAS DARK AND SHE WAS SMILING HE MOVED HIS HEAD A LITTLE
SHE EXPECTED HE WAS ANGRY
SHE WAS OBLIGED AT LENGTH TO GO BY HERSELF HOW MUCH DOES THE DIFFERENCE OF EXTERIOR CIRCUMSTANCES INFLUENCE NOT ONLY THE MANNERS BUT EVEN THE PERSONS OF SOME PEOPLE MISS MILNER IN LORD ELMWOOD'S DRAWING ROOM
MISS WOODLEY DID NOT FAIL TO GIVE BOTH GENTLEMEN REASON TO BELIEVE A CONTENTION OF THIS NATURE WAS THE ACTUAL STATE OF MISS MILNER'S MIND
DORRIFORTH FIXED HIS EYES UPON HER WITH SOME TOKENS OF COMPASSION WHILE SANDFORD SEEMED TO EXULT AND BY HIS REPEATED WELCOMES TO THE BARONET GAVE PROOFS HOW MUCH HE WAS REJOICED TO SEE HIM
THOU BIDDEST ME SERVE THEE AND STAND UP BEFORE THEE AS I WERE A SLAVE BOUGHT WITH THY SILVER BUT SOON SHALT THOU SEE WHAT IS IN STORE FOR THEE IN THE WAY OF CRACKING
AND OH CRIED SHE COULD HER GUARDIAN AND MISTER SANDFORD KNOW OF THIS CONFLICT HOW MUCH WOULD THEY HAVE TO ADMIRE HOW LITTLE TO CONDEMN WITH SUCH FRIENDLY THOUGHTS AND WITH THE PUREST INTENTIONS
AND I CAN NEVER PAY YOU BACK BUT I'LL SHOW YOU A SECRET THAT NO ONE ELSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS CUTHBERT LIKED SECRETS SO HE WAS RATHER PLEASED BUT BEARDY NED CHANGED THE SUBJECT
AND SUCK DOWN THE FLIES THAT FELL ON THE WATER WHEN THEY WERE TIRED OF DANCING IN THE AIR CUTHBERT AND MARIAN AND DORIS AND GWENDOLEN WERE ALL VERY FOND OF THIS RIVER
BECAUSE THAT WAS WHERE HE HAD FIRST MET HIS DEAD WIFE HE HAD LIVED SO MUCH IN THE OPEN AIR THAT HIS SKIN WAS AS DARK AS A RED INDIAN'S AND WHEN HE LAUGHED HIS TEETH WERE LIKE SNOW AND HIS EYES LIKE THE SEA ON A SUNNY DAY
ONCE UPON A TIME A MOUSE DWELT IN THE HOUSE OF A MERCHANT WHO OWNED MUCH MERCHANDISE AND GREAT STORIES OF MONIES ONE NIGHT
SHE HAD LEFT HIM WITH A LITTLE GIRL ONLY TEN MONTHS OLD AND THAT WAS WHY NED HAD LET HIS BEARD GROW HE HADN'T TIME HE SAID TO LOOK AFTER THE LITTLE GIRL AND SHAVE HIS FACE EVERY DAY AS WELL
EXCEPT WHEN THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN PROPOSED AND YOU THOUGHT IT POLITENESS TO APPEAR SATISFIED AND I WAS SATISFIED TILL I RECOLLECTED THAT YOU MIGHT PROBABLY BE OF THE PARTY THEN EVERY GROVE WAS CHANGED INTO A WILDERNESS
BUT THIS AVAILED NAUGHT AND HE WAS AT HIS WITS END FOR WHAT TO DO SO HE SAID TO HIM IN SOFT LOW ACCENTS VERILY YOU TRIBE OF FOXES
SHE WOULD BE SURE TO DROWN BECAUSE BEARDY NED WAS NOWHERE IN SIGHT
A TOKEN OF APPROBATION FROM YOU MISTER DORRIFORTH RETURNED SHE I ALWAYS CONSIDERED WITH HIGH ESTIMATION BUT YOUR COMMENDATIONS ARE NOW BECOME INFINITELY SUPERIOR IN VALUE BY THEIR SCARCITY
BUT BEFORE ANY ACCOMMODATION COULD TAKE PLACE THE PEACE AND COMPOSURE OF THEIR ABODE
SIR EDWARD IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION ENQUIRED
THOSE INVOLUNTARY SIGHS HOWEVER THAT MISS WOODLEY HAD LONG AGO OBSERVED
AND GROWING BIGGER AND BIGGER THAT MEANT THAT A TROUT HAD BEEN LYING IN WAIT WITH HIS EYE COCKED ON THE SURFACE OF THE STREAM AND HAD SEEN THE FLY AND LIKED THE LOOK OF HIM AND SUDDENLY DECIDED TO SWALLOW HIM UP
BUT THERE WERE PREPARATIONS IMAGINABLE READILY ENOUGH BY THOSE WHO HAD SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE REMOTE AND FASHIONABLE TOWN OF SANDBOURNE SOMETHING WAS GROWING UP UNDER THE HANDS OF SEVERAL PERSONS WHO HAD NEVER SEEN GRACE MELBURY
SHE WOULD NOT RELINQUISH HER OPPORTUNITY
SO MUCH THE BETTER I HAD TO FIGHT THE BATTLE OF LIFE AS WELL AS YOU I MAY TELL YOU ABOUT IT SOME DAY BUT DON'T EVER ASK ME TO DO IT AND PARTICULARLY DO NOT PRESS ME TO TELL YOU NOW
INDEED I ROSE LATE TO DAY I HAVE HAD A BROKEN NIGHT OR RATHER MORNING
CONFLAGRATION BUT BURSTING OUT NOW HERE NOW THERE THE ONLY CERTAIN ELEMENT IN THEIR DIRECTION BEING ITS UNEXPECTEDNESS
THE ONE OR TWO WOODMEN WHO SAWED SHAPED SPOKESHAVED ON HER FATHER'S PREMISES AT THIS INACTIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR REGULARLY CAME AND UNLOCKED THE DOORS IN THE MORNING LOCKED THEM IN THE EVENING SUPPED
THE OUT BUILDINGS THE GARDEN EVERY OBJECT WORE THAT ASPECT OF MESMERIC FIXITY
HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER IN A FLUTTER OF EXCITEMENT OVER THE WEDDING GOWN JUST ARRIVED FROM THE LEADING DRESS MAKER OF SANDBOURNE WATERING PLACE AFORESAID DURING THESE WEEKS GILES WINTERBORNE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN OR HEARD OF
AFTER WHICH HIS DEPARTURE FROM HINTOCK WOULD BE IRREVOCABLE BUT COULD HE GO AWAY REMEMBERING WHAT HAD JUST PASSED THE TREES THE HILLS THE LEAVES THE GRASS
HER DREAMY EYES RESTING ON THE SWAYING TIP OF A DISTANT TREE
WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CARE BUT IT WAS NOT HEAVY FOR ITS SIZE MISSUS DOLLERY HERSELF CARRIED IT INTO THE HOUSE
THE SLEEVE OF A DRESSING GOWN WHICH MISTER FITZPIERS HAD BEEN WEARING ON HER OWN MEMORABLE VISIT TO HIM HER FACE FIRED RED SHE HAD JUST BEFORE THOUGHT OF DRESSING HERSELF AND TAKING A LONELY WALK UNDER THE TREES
AND BEHAVING GENERALLY AS BECAME A PATIENT WHO WAS IN NO GREAT HURRY TO LOSE THAT TITLE ON EACH OCCASION HE LOOKED GRAVELY AT THE LITTLE SCRATCH ON HER ARM AS IF IT HAD BEEN A SERIOUS WOUND
DOCTOR YOU ARE GOING AWAY SHE EXCLAIMED CONFRONTING HIM WITH ACCUSATORY REPROACH IN HER LARGE DARK EYES NO LESS THAN IN HER RICH COOING VOICE OH YES YOU ARE SHE WENT ON SPRINGING TO HER FEET
SHE LIKED MYSTERY IN HER LIFE IN HER LOVE IN HER HISTORY
FITZPIERS TOOK HER HAND WE DECLARE IT DO WE NOT MY DEAR GRACE SAID HE RELIEVED OF HER DOUBT SOMEWHAT OVERAWED AND EVER ANXIOUS TO PLEASE SHE WAS DISPOSED TO SETTLE THE MATTER YET WOMANLIKE
THAT'S WHERE THE SECRET LIES I'LL WARRANT ME NO FATHER NO IT IS NOT GILES IT IS SOMETHING I CANNOT TELL YOU OF WELL MAKE FOOLS OF US ALL MAKE US LAUGHING STOCKS BREAK IT OFF HAVE YOUR OWN WAY
AND WHY DIDN'T SHE MARRY HIM SAID MISSUS CHARMOND BECAUSE YOU SEE MA'AM HE LOST HIS HOUSES LOST HIS HOUSES
WELL THAT'S THE END OF ALL LOVE ACCORDING TO NATURE'S LAW I CAN GIVE NO OTHER REASON OH DON'T SPEAK LIKE THAT SHE EXCLAIMED SINCE WE ARE ONLY PICTURING THE POSSIBILITIES OF THAT TIME DON'T FOR PITY'S SAKE SPOIL THE PICTURE
THAT'S A MISTAKE OF HIS AND YOURS SIR I SPOKE TO HIM SO CLOSELY ABOUT THE QUESTION OF MARRIAGE WITH YOU THAT HE DID NOT APPREHEND MY STATE OF MIND
THINK IT WITH ALL YOUR HEART SAID HE IT IS A PLEASANT THOUGHT AND COSTS NOTHING SHE WEIGHED THAT REMARK IN SILENCE A WHILE DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING OF ME FROM THEN TILL NOW SHE INQUIRED NOT A WORD
MOREOVER SHE WAS PROUD AS A CULTIVATED WOMAN TO BE THE WIFE OF A CULTIVATED MAN IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY DENIED VERY FREQUENTLY TO YOUNG WOMEN IN HER POSITION NOWADAYS NOT A FEW
IN THE EVENING WITH LISTLESS ADROITNESS SHE ENCOURAGED THE MAID WHO DRESSED HER FOR DINNER TO SPEAK OF DOCTOR FITZPIERS'S MARRIAGE MISSUS FITZPIERS WAS ONCE SUPPOSED TO FAVOR MISTER WINTERBORNE SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN
ON THE DAY SHE BECAME A WIFE SO NEAR WAS THE TIME THE TINTS OF THE FOLIAGE WOULD HARDLY HAVE CHANGED EVERYTHING WAS SO MUCH AS USUAL THAT NO ITINERANT STRANGER WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED A WOMAN'S FATE TO BE HANGING IN THE BALANCE AT THAT SUMMER'S DECLINE
THUS THE TWO OR THREE DAYS THAT THEY HAD SPENT IN TENDER ACQUAINTANCE ON THE ROMANTIC SLOPES ABOVE THE NECKAR WERE STRETCHED OUT IN RETROSPECT TO THE LENGTH AND IMPORTANCE OF YEARS MADE TO FORM A CANVAS FOR INFINITE FANCIES
TIM TANGS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN SHE ENTERED THE SHELTER OF THE TALL HEDGE AND ONLY THE TOP OF HER HEAD COULD BE SEEN HASTENING IN THE DIRECTION OF HER OWN DWELLING
SHE JUMPED AT THE OPPORTUNITY OF HONORING HIS WORD AT THE MOMENT OF HER MENTAL LIBERATION THE BUSHES ABOUT THE GARDEN HAD MOVED AND HER FATHER EMERGED INTO THE SHADY GLADE WELL I HOPE IT IS MADE UP HE SAID CHEERILY
PRAY GOD IT IS FOR THE BEST FROM THIS HOUR THERE WAS NO SERIOUS ATTEMPT AT RECALCITRATION ON HER PART FITZPIERS KEPT HIMSELF CONTINUALLY NEAR HER DOMINATING ANY REBELLIOUS IMPULSE
AND SHE JUMPED UP PRESSED HIS HAND AND LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT HIM IT IS NECESSARY IT IS BEST FOR BOTH YOU AND ME
IN THE HOUSE OF A FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR AND GONE AWAY PEOPLE SAID THAT A CERTAIN LAXITY HAD CREPT INTO HIS LIFE THAT HE HAD NEVER GONE NEAR A CHURCH LATTERLY AND HAD BEEN SOMETIMES SEEN ON SUNDAYS WITH UNBLACKED BOOTS LYING ON HIS ELBOW UNDER A TREE
HIS REMOTE GAZE AT HER HAD BEEN ONE OF MILD INTEREST RATHER THAN OF RAPTURE BUT SHE LOOKED SO LOVELY IN THE GREEN WORLD ABOUT HER HER PINK CHEEKS HER SIMPLE LIGHT DRESS
IT WAS TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE HE VISITED MISSUS CHARMOND AGAIN THE MORNING HAD BEEN WINDY AND LITTLE SHOWERS HAD SOWED THEMSELVES LIKE GRAIN AGAINST THE WALLS AND WINDOW PANES OF THE HINTOCK COTTAGES
AND MADE REMARKS TO EACH OTHER AS THEY WATCHED ITS ENTRANCE MELBURY STOOD AT THE DOOR OF THE TIMBER SHED IN THE ATTITUDE OF A MAN TO WHOM SUCH AN ARRIVAL WAS A TRIFLING DOMESTIC DETAIL WITH WHICH HE DID NOT CONDESCEND TO BE CONCERNED
DONE WE HAVE DONE NOTHING PERHAPS WE HAVE THOUGHT THE MORE HOWEVER IT IS ALL VEXATION I AM GOING AWAY TO MIDDLETON ABBEY NEAR SHOTTSFORD WHERE A RELATIVE OF MY LATE HUSBAND LIVES WHO IS CONFINED TO HER BED
AND MANY THINGS OF WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROUD BUT IT HAD NEVER BEEN FATHOMED BY THE HONEST MINDS OF HINTOCK AND SHE RARELY VOLUNTEERED HER EXPERIENCES AS FOR HER CAPRICIOUS NATURE THE PEOPLE ON HER ESTATES GREW ACCUSTOMED TO IT
TO HOLY CHURCH WE'LL GO AND MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO US THEY RETURNED THROUGH THE BUSHES INDOORS GRACE WALKING FULL OF THOUGHT BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO SOMEWHAT COMFORTED BOTH BY FITZPIERS'S INGENIOUS EXPLANATION AND BY THE SENSE THAT SHE WAS NOT
RAN DOWN THE BARK OF THE OAKS AND ELMS THE RIND BELOW BEING COATED WITH A LICHENOUS WASH AS GREEN AS EMERALD THEY WERE STOUT TRUNKED TREES THAT NEVER ROCKED THEIR STEMS IN THE FIERCEST GALE
THOUGH IT WAS NOT COLD WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN HE ASKED SHE SAT IN AN EASY CHAIR HER FACE BEING TURNED AWAY OH SHE MURMURED IT IS BECAUSE THE WORLD IS SO DREARY OUTSIDE
I NATURALLY CANNOT FORGET THAT LITTLE SPACE IN WHICH I FLITTED ACROSS THE FIELD OF YOUR VISION IN THOSE DAYS OF THE PAST AND THE RECOLLECTION OPENS UP ALL SORTS OF IMAGININGS SUPPOSE MY MOTHER HAD NOT TAKEN ME AWAY SHE MURMURED
THE WHITE SKIRT OF A LONG LOOSE GARMENT A GRAY ARM STRETCHING FROM WITHIN THE PORCH ADJUSTED THE SHAWL OVER THE WOMAN'S SHOULDERS IT WAS WITHDRAWN AND DISAPPEARED THE DOOR CLOSING BEHIND HER
MY EYES WERE SO HEAVY THIS MORNING THAT I COULD HAVE WEPT MY LIFE AWAY I CANNOT BEAR YOU TO SEE MY FACE I KEEP IT AWAY FROM YOU PURPOSELY
AND SHE EXPERIENCED A MOURNFUL WANT OF SOME ONE TO CONFIDE IN THE DAY LOOMED SO BIG AND NIGH THAT HER PROPHETIC EAR COULD IN FANCY CATCH THE NOISE OF IT HEAR THE MURMUR OF THE VILLAGERS AS SHE CAME OUT OF CHURCH
THEN I AM GOING HE SAID VERY WELL SHE ANSWERED STRETCHING ONE HAND ROUND TO HIM AND PATTING HER EYES WITH A HANDKERCHIEF HELD IN THE OTHER
BUT WHO KNOWS OF THE ENGAGEMENT AS YET HOW CAN BREAKING IT DISGRACE YOU MELBURY THEN BY DEGREES ADMITTED THAT HE HAD MENTIONED THE ENGAGEMENT
IMAGINE THE JANGLE OF THE THREE THIN TONED HINTOCK BELLS THE DIALOGUES SEEMED TO GROW LOUDER AND THE DING DING DONG OF THOSE THREE CRAZED BELLS MORE PERSISTENT SHE AWOKE THE MORNING HAD COME
OF SOME INNERMOST CREEK OF AN EMBAYED SEA YET NO NEWS INTERFERED WITH THE NUPTIAL PURPOSE AT THEIR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE THE SAPPY GREEN TWIG TIPS OF THE SEASON'S GROWTH WOULD NOT SHE THOUGHT BE APPRECIABLY WOODIER
WE KNOW BETTER JEALOUS OH NO
AT LEAST WITH MORE EMOTIONAL TURBULENCE THAN AT ANY PREVIOUS TIME WHY DID MISSUS DOLLERY'S VAN INSTEAD OF PASSING ALONG AT THE END OF THE SMALLER VILLAGE TO GREAT HINTOCK DIRECT TURN ONE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO LITTLE HINTOCK LANE
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HA HA HA
IF OUR WEDDING CAN BE AT CHURCH I SAY YES SHE ANSWERED IN A MEASURED VOICE IF NOT I SAY NO FITZPIERS WAS GENEROUS IN HIS TURN IT SHALL BE SO HE REJOINED GRACEFULLY
NOW FOR A WINTER OF REGRETS AND AGONIES AND USELESS WISHES TILL I FORGET HIM IN THE SPRING OH I AM GLAD I AM GOING AWAY SHE LEFT HER CHAMBER AND WENT DOWN TO DINE WITH A SIGH
THOSE IN WHOM PARENTAL DISCOVERY OF THE VALUE OF EDUCATION HAS IMPLANTED TASTES WHICH PARENTAL CIRCLES FAIL TO GRATIFY BUT WHAT AN ATTENUATION WAS THIS COLD PRIDE OF THE DREAM OF HER YOUTH
SOMETHING BROKE THE STILLNESS THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE SHE WAS GAZING AT OPENED SOFTLY AND THERE CAME OUT INTO THE PORCH A FEMALE FIGURE WRAPPED IN A LARGE SHAWL BENEATH WHICH WAS VISIBLE
BEEN PAID AND HAD RUMBLED AWAY HE ENTERED THE DWELLING
HE DREW BACK THE WINDOW CURTAINS WHEREUPON THE RED GLOW OF THE LAMP AND THE TWO CANDLE FLAMES BECAME ALMOST INVISIBLE WITH THE FLOOD OF LATE AUTUMN SUNLIGHT THAT POURED IN SHALL I COME ROUND TO YOU HE ASKED HER BACK BEING TOWARDS HIM NO
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM LOOK SO INCENSED BEFORE NOW HEARKEN TO ME HE SAID THERE'S A TIME FOR A WOMAN TO ALTER HER MIND AND THERE'S A TIME WHEN SHE CAN NO LONGER ALTER IT IF SHE HAS ANY RIGHT EYE TO HER PARENTS HONOR
I CONGRATULATE YE IT IS ONLY A MONTH TO DAY TO THE TIME SHE DID NOT ANSWER BUT WITHOUT LIFTING HER DRESS WADED BETWEEN THE DEWY ROWS OF TALL POTATO GREEN INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PLOT WHERE HE WAS
SHE ROSE WHEN THE SPARROWS BEGAN TO WALK OUT OF THE ROOF HOLES SAT ON THE FLOOR OF HER ROOM IN THE DIM LIGHT AND BY AND BY PEEPED OUT BEHIND THE WINDOW CURTAINS IT WAS EVEN NOW DAY OUT OF DOORS
I WISH NOT TO MARRY ANYBODY BUT I'LL MARRY GILES WINTERBORNE IF YOU SAY I MUST AS AN ALTERNATIVE HER FATHER'S FACE SETTLED INTO RIGIDITY HE TURNED PALE AND CAME DELIBERATELY OUT OF THE PLOT BEFORE HE ANSWERED HER
THOUGH THE TONES OF MORNING WERE FEEBLE AND WAN AND IT WAS LONG BEFORE THE SUN WOULD BE PERCEPTIBLE IN THIS OVERSHADOWED VALE NOT A SOUND CAME FROM ANY OF THE OUT HOUSES AS YET THE TREE TRUNKS THE ROAD
PERFECTLY MADDENED WITH AN ACHING TOOTH AS NO BODY HEARD HER RING SHE THREW SOME GRAVEL AT MY WINDOW TILL AT LAST I HEARD HER AND SLIPPED ON MY DRESSING GOWN AND WENT DOWN THE POOR THING BEGGED ME WITH TEARS IN HER EYES TO TAKE OUT HER TORMENTOR
TANGS HAD MOMENTARILY STOPPED TO TAKE A PINCH OF SNUFF BUT OBSERVING MISSUS CHARMOND GAZING AT HIM HE HASTENED TO GET OVER THE TOP OUT OF HAIL
WITH AN AIR WHICH MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN CALLED PASSIONATE IT IS NO USE DENYING IT YOU HAVE BOUGHT A PRACTICE AT BUDMOUTH
SO THAT IT MIGHT CATCH THE EYES OF THE SERVANTS AND MAKE HIS PRESENCE APPEAR DECIDEDLY NECESSARY IN CASE THERE SHOULD BE ANY DOUBT OF THE FACT OH YOU HURT ME SHE EXCLAIMED ONE DAY HE WAS PEELING OFF THE BIT OF PLASTER ON HER ARM
WITH A CYNICAL GAZE AT SURROUNDING OBJECTS HE WAS LIKELY TO RETURN TO HINTOCK WHEN THE CIDER MAKING SEASON CAME ROUND HIS APPARATUS BEING STORED THERE AND TRAVEL WITH HIS MILL AND PRESS FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE
I BECOME FULL OF FEARS TILL I THINK I SHALL DIE FOR VERY FEAR THE TERRIBLE INSISTENCIES OF SOCIETY HOW SEVERE THEY ARE AND COLD AND INEXORABLE GHASTLY TOWARDS THOSE WHO ARE MADE OF WAX AND NOT OF STONE OH I AM AFRAID OF THEM
MY REFLECTIONS DOCTOR YOU MUST NOT COME HERE ANY MORE THEY BEGIN TO THINK IT A FARCE ALREADY I SAY YOU MUST COME NO MORE
WHEN ATTIRED SHE SEARCHED ABOUT THE HOUSE FOR HER FATHER SHE FOUND HIM AT LAST IN THE GARDEN STOOPING TO EXAMINE THE POTATOES FOR SIGNS OF DISEASE HEARING HER RUSTLE HE STOOD UP AND STRETCHED HIS BACK AND ARMS SAYING
AND NEVER PULL UP TILL IT REACHED MISTER MELBURY'S GATES THE GILDING SHINE OF EVENING FELL UPON A LARGE FLAT BOX NOT LESS THAN A YARD SQUARE AND SAFELY TIED WITH CORD AS IT WAS HANDED OUT FROM UNDER THE TILT
THE WOMAN WENT QUICKLY DOWN THE BOX EDGED PATH BETWEEN THE RASPBERRIES AND CURRANTS AND AS SHE WALKED HER WELL DEVELOPED FORM AND GAIT BETRAYED HER INDIVIDUALITY
I HAVE BEEN THINKING VERY MUCH ABOUT MY POSITION THIS MORNING EVER SINCE IT WAS LIGHT SHE BEGAN EXCITEDLY AND TREMBLING SO THAT SHE COULD HARDLY STAND AND I FEEL IT IS A FALSE ONE I WISH NOT TO MARRY MISTER FITZPIERS
AND WITH THAT MARVELLOUS SUBTLETY OF CONTRIVANCE IN STEERING ROUND ODD TEMPERS THAT IS FOUND IN SONS OF THE SOIL AND DEPENDANTS GENERALLY THEY MANAGED TO GET ALONG UNDER HER GOVERNMENT RATHER BETTER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE DONE BENEATH A MORE EQUABLE RULE
IN THE ENSUING TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE EVENING AFTER LEAVING HER HE WENT OUT INTO THE LANE AND WALKED AND PONDERED BETWEEN THE HIGH HEDGES NOW GREENISH WHITE WITH WILD CLEMATIS HERE CALLED OLD MAN'S BEARD FROM ITS ASPECT LATER IN THE YEAR
I HAVE REFUSED THE OPPORTUNITY I LOVE THIS PLACE TOO WELL TO DEPART YOU HAVE
PREPARING DOWN STAIRS THOUGH ON ROUSING HERSELF TO ROBE AND DESCEND SHE FOUND THAT THE SUN WAS THROWING HIS RAYS COMPLETELY OVER THE TREE TOPS A PROGRESS OF NATURAL PHENOMENA DENOTING THAT AT LEAST THREE HOURS HAD ELAPSED
COME HE INSISTED FIXING HIS EYES UPON HER TELL ME AT ONCE I SAY IT WAS THE GREATER STRENGTH AGAINST THE SMALLER BUT SHE WAS MASTERED LESS BY HIS MANNER THAN BY HER OWN SENSE OF THE UNFAIRNESS OF SILENCE
WHEREIN HUNG SOLITARY THE FOLDING STAR I SAID AT ONCE THAT YOU HAD FINALLY AGREED TO PAY THE PREMIUM THEY ASK AND THAT THE TEDIOUS QUESTION HAD BEEN SETTLED WHEN DO WE GO EDGAR I HAVE ALTERED MY MIND SAID HE
THE HOMAGE OF A THOUSAND HEARTS THE FOND DEEP LOVE OF ONE EVERYTHING HAD BEEN CLEAR THEN IN IMAGINATION NOW SOMETHING WAS UNDEFINED SHE HAD LITTLE CARKING ANXIETIES A CURIOUS FATEFULNESS SEEMED TO RULE HER
FITZPIERS HAD SEATED HIMSELF NEAR HER WHAT SETS YOU IN THIS MOURNFUL MOOD HE ASKED GENTLY IN REALITY HE KNEW THAT IT WAS THE RESULT OF A LOSS OF TONE FROM STAYING IN DOORS SO MUCH BUT HE DID NOT SAY SO
THEY WANT TOO MUCH SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY IS TOO LARGE A SUM AND IN SHORT I HAVE DECLINED TO GO FURTHER WE MUST WAIT FOR ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY I FEAR I AM NOT A GOOD BUSINESS MAN
IT WAS ALL SO PLAUSIBLE SO COMPLETELY EXPLAINED KNOWING NOTHING OF THE INCIDENT IN THE WOOD ON OLD MIDSUMMER EVE GRACE FELT THAT HER SUSPICIONS WERE UNWORTHY AND ABSURD AND WITH THE READINESS OF AN HONEST HEART
BEYOND THE ROAD WERE SOME COTTAGE ROOFS AND ORCHARDS OVER THESE ROOFS AND OVER THE APPLE TREES BEHIND
NO NO A GENTLE REASONABLENESS CAME INTO HER TONE AS SHE ADDED IT MUST NOT BE YOU KNOW IT WON'T DO VERY WELL GOOD BY THE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS GONE
FITZPIERS CONTRADICTED THIS IDEA IN HIS MOST VIBRATORY TONES AND SHE LAPSED INTO THE FRIVOLOUS ARCHNESS UNDER WHICH SHE HID PASSIONS OF NO MEAN STRENGTH STRANGE SMOULDERING ERRATIC PASSIONS KEPT DOWN LIKE A STIFLED
YET HE WELL DIVINED THE CONTENTS OF THAT BOX AND WAS IN TRUTH ALL THE WHILE IN A PLEASANT EXALTATION AT THE PROOF THAT THUS FAR AT ANY RATE NO DISAPPOINTMENT HAD SUPERVENED
AND MY DEAR FRIEND IF I CONTINUE TO FEEL ABOUT THE BUSINESS AS I FEEL AT THIS MOMENT PERHAPS I MAY CONCLUDE NEVER TO GO AT ALL BUT YOU HATE HINTOCK AND EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN IT THAT YOU DON'T MEAN TO TAKE AWAY WITH YOU
AND THEN THEN THE FIRE WOULD HAVE BURNED HIGHER AND HIGHER WHAT WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED I KNOW NOT BUT SORROW AND SICKNESS OF HEART AT LAST
TILL SHE PERCEIVED THAT IN HIS RESTLESSNESS AND PRIDE HE HAD PUBLISHED IT EVERYWHERE
HER VOICE SANK ALMOST TO A WHISPER AS SHE ADDED WITH AN INCIPIENT POUT UPON HER FULL LIPS LET ME THINK AT LEAST THAT IF YOU HAD REALLY LOVED ME AT ALL SERIOUSLY YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED ME FOR EVER AND EVER YOU ARE RIGHT
AND THE SEEMLINESS OF THINGS
LEANED OVER THEIR GARDEN GATES FOR A WHIFF OF EVENING AIR AND TO CATCH ANY LAST AND FARTHEST THROB OF NEWS FROM THE OUTER WORLD WHICH ENTERED AND EXPIRED AT LITTLE HINTOCK LIKE THE EXHAUSTED SWELL OF A WAVE IN SOME INNERMOST CAVERN
NOBODY CAN LIVE AT HINTOCK LEAST OF ALL A PROFESSIONAL MAN WHO WANTS TO KEEP ABREAST OF RECENT DISCOVERY AND THERE IS NOBODY HERE TO INDUCE SUCH A ONE TO STAY FOR OTHER REASONS THAT'S RIGHT
WHY SHOULD DEATH ONLY LEND WHAT LIFE IS COMPELLED TO BORROW REST ANSWER THAT DOCTOR FITZPIERS YOU MUST EAT OF A SECOND TREE OF KNOWLEDGE BEFORE YOU CAN DO IT FELICE CHARMOND THEN WHEN MY EMOTIONS HAVE EXHAUSTED THEMSELVES
AND SHAPING HER WILL INTO PASSIVE CONCURRENCE WITH ALL HIS DESIRES APART FROM HIS LOVER LIKE ANXIETY TO POSSESS HER THE FEW GOLDEN HUNDREDS OF THE TIMBER DEALER READY TO HAND FORMED A WARM BACKGROUND TO GRACE'S LOVELY FACE
LENDS TO SUCH SCENES OUTSIDE HER WINDOW HELPLESS IMMOBILITY SEEMED TO BE COMBINED WITH INTENSE CONSCIOUSNESS A MEDITATIVE INERTNESS POSSESSED ALL THINGS OPPRESSIVELY CONTRASTING WITH HER OWN ACTIVE EMOTIONS
SURELY AND SILENTLY WHENEVER GRACE HAD ANY DOUBTS OF HER POSITION THE SENSE OF CONTRACTING TIME WAS LIKE A SHORTENING CHAMBER AT OTHER MOMENTS SHE WAS COMPARATIVELY BLITHE DAY AFTER DAY WAXED AND WANED
PERSONALLY SHE LIKED THE HOME OF HER CHILDHOOD MUCH AND SHE WAS NOT AMBITIOUS BUT HER HUSBAND HAD SEEMED SO DISSATISFIED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES HEREABOUT SINCE THEIR MARRIAGE THAT SHE HAD SINCERELY HOPED TO GO FOR HIS SAKE
EACH HAD BEEN ENDOWED AND QUICKENED WITH A SUBTLE CHARM SINCE HE HAD DISCOVERED THE PERSON AND HISTORY AND ABOVE ALL MOOD OF THEIR OWNER THERE WAS EVERY TEMPORAL REASON FOR LEAVING IT
AND EDGING THROUGH A SLIT IN THE GARDEN FENCE WALKED AWAY INTO THE WOOD JUST ABOUT HERE THE TREES WERE LARGE AND WIDE APART AND THERE WAS NO UNDERGROWTH SO THAT SHE COULD BE SEEN TO SOME DISTANCE A SYLPH LIKE GREENISH WHITE CREATURE
THE DOCTOR'S PROFESSIONAL VISIT TO HINTOCK HOUSE WAS PROMPTLY REPEATED THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT
I WON'T SAY TO YE YOU SHALL MARRY HIM BUT I WILL SAY THAT IF YOU REFUSE I SHALL FOREVER BE ASHAMED AND A WEARY OF YE AS A DAUGHTER AND SHALL LOOK UPON YOU AS THE HOPE OF MY LIFE NO MORE
MY HOT BLOOD INDEED FITZPIERS EXAMINED SO CLOSELY THAT HIS BREATH TOUCHED HER TENDERLY AT WHICH THEIR EYES ROSE TO AN ENCOUNTER HERS SHOWING THEMSELVES AS DEEP AND MYSTERIOUS AS INTERSTELLAR SPACE
IN REFUSING THAT POOR MAN HIS REASONABLE REQUEST SHE SAID TO HERSELF I FOREDOOMED MY REJUVENATED GIRLHOOD'S ROMANCE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SUCH A BUSINESS MATTER COULD HAVE NETTLED MY OWN HEART LIKE THIS
SHE SAID WITH HESITATION I'LL TELL YOU BY AND BY I MUST GO IN DOORS I HAVE HAD NO BREAKFAST BY A SORT OF DIVINATION HIS CONJECTURE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FACT NOR I SAID HE LIGHTLY
CORRECTIVES AND REGULATIONS FRAMED THAT SOCIETY MAY TEND TO PERFECTION
HE LEFT HER AT THE DOOR OF HER FATHER'S HOUSE AS HE RECEDED AND WAS CLASPED OUT OF SIGHT BY THE FILMY SHADES HE IMPRESSED GRACE AS A MAN WHO HARDLY APPERTAINED TO HER EXISTENCE AT ALL
AND FITZPIERS WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE WINDOW CURTAINS WERE CLOSED AND A RED SHADED LAMP AND CANDLES BURNING
AS TONED BY THE SUNLIGHT AND LEAFAGE SHE HEARD A FOOT FALL CRUSHING DEAD LEAVES BEHIND HER AND FOUND HERSELF RECONNOITERED BY FITZPIERS HIMSELF APPROACHING GAY AND FRESH AS THE MORNING AROUND THEM
AND WENT SOME WAY TO REMOVE HIS UNEASINESS AT THE PROSPECT OF ENDANGERING HIS PROFESSIONAL AND SOCIAL CHANCES BY AN ALLIANCE WITH THE FAMILY OF A SIMPLE COUNTRYMAN THE INTERIM CLOSED UP ITS PERSPECTIVE
OH YES SAID FITZPIERS WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON GRACE WHOSE EYES WERE SHYLY BENT DOWNWARD NOW SAID HER FATHER TELL ME THE PAIR OF YE
IDLE DREAMS LUXURIOUS MELANCHOLIES AND SWEET ALLURING ASSERTIONS WHICH COULD NEITHER BE PROVED NOR DISPROVED GRACE WAS NEVER MENTIONED BETWEEN THEM BUT A RUMOR OF HIS PROPOSED DOMESTIC CHANGES SOMEHOW REACHED HER EARS
TO TROUBLESOME DUBIOUSNESS MATRIMONIAL AMBITION IS SUCH AN HONORABLE THING MY FATHER HAS TOLD ME THAT YOU HAVE SENT OFF ONE OF THE MEN WITH A LATE LETTER TO BUDMOUTH CRIED GRACE COMING OUT VIVACIOUSLY TO MEET HIM UNDER THE DECLINING LIGHT OF THE SKY
NEVER WOULD SEE HER OR CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HER AT ALL THOUGH THEIR CREATION HAD SUCH INTERESTING RELATION TO HER LIFE THAT IT WOULD ENCLOSE HER VERY HEART AT A MOMENT WHEN THAT HEART WOULD BEAT IF NOT WITH MORE EMOTIONAL ARDOR
AND SO GOT THE LETTER OFF THE MAN RETURNED MET FITZPIERS IN THE LANE AND TOLD HIM THE THING WAS DONE FITZPIERS WENT BACK TO HIS HOUSE MUSING
IN WHICH SHE HAD PICTURED HERSELF WALKING IN STATE TOWARDS THE ALTAR FLUSHED BY THE PURPLE LIGHT AND BLOOM OF HER OWN PASSION WITHOUT A SINGLE MISGIVING AS TO THE SEALING OF THE BOND AND FERVENTLY RECEIVING AS HER DUE
HE SPOKE THE LAST WORDS WITH A MOMENTARY FALTERING AT THE GREAT FOOLISHNESS OF HIS ACT FOR AS HE LOOKED IN HER FAIR AND HONORABLE FACE HIS HEART REPROACHED HIM FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE HER MANNER THAT EVENING SHOWED HER DISAPPOINTMENT
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT LIFE AND WHAT IT CAN BRING FORTH AND HOW YOU OUGHT TO ACT TO LEAD UP TO BEST ENDS OH YOU ARE AN UNGRATEFUL MAID GRACE YOU'VE SEEN THAT FELLOW GILES AND HE HAS GOT OVER YE
HE DREW A TROUBLED BREATH AND WENT IN DOORS HERE HE RAPIDLY PENNED A LETTER
THE NARROW INTERVAL THAT STOOD BEFORE THE DAY DIMINISHED YET THERE WAS IN GRACE'S MIND SOMETIMES A CERTAIN ANTICIPATIVE SATISFACTION THE SATISFACTION OF FEELING THAT SHE WOULD BE THE HEROINE OF AN HOUR
SORROW AND BITTERNESS IN THE SKY AND FLOODS OF AGONIZED TEARS BEATING AGAINST THE PANES I LAY AWAKE LAST NIGHT AND I COULD HEAR THE SCRAPE OF SNAILS CREEPING UP THE WINDOW GLASS IT WAS SO SAD
ONLY TO MIDDLETON ABBEY FOR A MONTH OR TWO YET PERHAPS I SHALL GAIN STRENGTH THERE PARTICULARLY STRENGTH OF MIND I REQUIRE IT AND WHEN I COME BACK I SHALL BE A NEW WOMAN AND YOU CAN COME AND SEE ME SAFELY THEN AND BRING YOUR WIFE WITH YOU
AND THE DELICATE FLEXIBILITY OF HER MOVEMENT ACQUIRED SUCH RARITY FROM THEIR WILD WOOD SETTING THAT HIS EYES KINDLED AS HE DREW NEAR MY DARLING WHAT IS IT YOUR FATHER SAYS YOU ARE IN THE POUTS AND JEALOUS
HIS WIFE HERSELF SAW THE AWKWARDNESS OF THEIR POSITION HERE AND CHEERFULLY WELCOMED THE PURPOSED CHANGE TOWARDS WHICH EVERY STEP HAD BEEN TAKEN BUT THE LAST BUT COULD HE FIND IT IN HIS HEART AS HE FOUND IT CLEARLY ENOUGH IN HIS CONSCIENCE TO GO AWAY
HALF WAY UP THE STEEP GREEN SLOPE CONFRONTING HER STOOD OLD TIMOTHY TANGS WHO WAS SHORTENING HIS WAY HOMEWARD BY CLAMBERING HERE WHERE THERE WAS NO ROAD AND IN OPPOSITION TO EXPRESS ORDERS THAT NO PATH WAS TO BE MADE THERE
THE SHOCK GIVEN TO HER GIRLISH SENSIBILITIES BY HIS IRREVERENT VIEWS OF MARRIAGE TOGETHER WITH THE SURE AND NEAR APPROACH OF THE DAY FIXED FOR COMMITTING HER FUTURE TO HIS KEEPING MADE HER SO RESTLESS
TO BE DEPRIVED OF A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY
SHE TURNED HER FACE AWAY SUDDENLY AH NONE OF THAT NONE OF THAT I CANNOT COQUET WITH YOU SHE CRIED DON'T SUPPOSE I CONSENT TO FOR ONE MOMENT OUR POOR BRIEF YOUTHFUL HOUR OF LOVE MAKING WAS TOO LONG AGO TO BEAR CONTINUING NOW
COQUET NOR I WITH YOU AS IT WAS WHEN I FOUND THE HISTORIC GLOVES SO IT IS NOW I MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE FOOLISH BUT I AM NO TRIFLER
AND WE'LL BE FRIENDS SHE AND I OH HOW THIS SHUTTING UP OF ONE'S SELF DOES LEAD TO INDULGENCE IN IDLE SENTIMENTS I SHALL NOT WISH YOU TO GIVE YOUR ATTENDANCE TO ME AFTER TO DAY
IF I DRAGGED HER HEAD OFF DOWN SHE SAT AND OUT IT CAME A LOVELY MOLAR NOT A SPECK UPON IT AND OFF SHE WENT WITH IT IN HER HANDKERCHIEF
HER WHOLE BEING SEEMED TO DISSOLVE IN A SAD POWERLESSNESS TO DO ANYTHING AND THE SENSE OF IT MADE HER LIPS TREMULOUS
DON'T TELL ME NOW DO YOU BIDE HERE I'LL SEND FITZPIERS TO YOU I SAW HIM SMOKING IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE BUT A MINUTE BY GONE HE WENT OFF HASTILY OUT OF THE GARDEN GATE AND DOWN THE LANE BUT SHE WOULD NOT STAY WHERE SHE WAS
MISSUS CHARMOND COULD OVERTLY BE NOTHING MORE TO HIM THAN A PATIENT NOW AND TO HIS WIFE AT THE OUTSIDE A PATRON IN THE UNATTACHED BACHELOR DAYS OF HIS FIRST SOJOURNING HERE HOW HIGHLY PROPER AN EMOTIONAL REASON FOR LINGERING ON WOULD HAVE APPEARED
SHE SHRANK AWAY AND HIS PURPOSED KISS MISCARRIED WHAT IS IT HE SAID MORE SERIOUSLY FOR THIS LITTLE DEFEAT SHE MADE NO ANSWER BEYOND MISTER FITZPIERS I HAVE HAD NO BREAKFAST I MUST GO IN
THE ENGAGEMENT WAS MADE IN LONDON AND I CAN'T GET OUT OF IT PERHAPS IT IS FOR THE BEST THAT I GO THERE TILL ALL THIS IS PAST WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO ENTER ON YOUR NEW PRACTICE AND LEAVE HINTOCK BEHIND FOREVER WITH YOUR PRETTY WIFE ON YOUR ARM
I RETURNED FOR A MOMENT TO TELL YOU THAT THE EVENING IS GOING TO BE FINE THE SUN IS SHINING SO DO OPEN YOUR CURTAINS AND PUT OUT THOSE LIGHTS SHALL I DO IT FOR YOU
NOTHING BESIDES YOU ARE GOING AWAY
AT THE CLOSE OF HIS TENURE IN HINTOCK HE HAD SOLD SOME OF HIS FURNITURE
YOU'VE HAD A TIFF A LOVERS TIFF THAT'S ALL I SUPPOSE IT IS SOME WOMAN
HE HAD ALSO TO HIS FURTHER SATISFACTION FOUND A SLIGHT SCAR ON HER TEMPLE AND IT WAS VERY CONVENIENT TO PUT A PIECE OF BLACK PLASTER ON THIS CONSPICUOUS PART OF HER PERSON IN PREFERENCE TO GOLD BEATER'S SKIN
RESPONDING TO IT ENTIRELY BY CROOKING THEIR LIMBS WRINKLED LIKE AN OLD CRONE'S FACE AND ANTLERED WITH DEAD BRANCHES THAT ROSE ABOVE THE FOLIAGE OF THEIR SUMMITS
NOW WITH REGARD TO THE DOCTOR'S NOTION OF LEAVING HINTOCK HE HAD ADVANCED FURTHER TOWARDS COMPLETING THE PURCHASE OF THE BUDMOUTH SURGEON'S GOOD WILL THAN HE HAD ADMITTED TO MISSUS CHARMOND THE WHOLE MATTER HUNG UPON WHAT HE MIGHT DO
WAS THE HOUSE YET OCCUPIED BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND THE ROUGH CAST FRONT SHOWING WHITELY THROUGH ITS CREEPERS THE WINDOW SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED THE BEDROOM CURTAINS CLOSELY DRAWN AND NOT THE THINNEST COIL OF SMOKE ROSE FROM THE RUGGED CHIMNEYS
WHY HAD HE CARRIED OUT THIS IMPULSE TAKEN SUCH WILD TROUBLE TO EFFECT A PROBABLE INJURY TO HIS OWN AND HIS YOUNG WIFE'S PROSPECTS HIS MOTIVE WAS FANTASTIC GLOWING SHAPELESS AS THE FIERY SCENERY ABOUT THE WESTERN SKY
CLEVERER GREATER THAN HERSELF ONE OUTSIDE HER MENTAL ORBIT AS SHE CONSIDERED HIM HE SEEMED TO BE HER RULER RATHER THAN HER EQUAL PROTECTOR AND DEAR FAMILIAR FRIEND THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD EXPERIENCED AT HIS WISH
IT WAS AT YOUR REQUEST I PUT IT ON SAID HE I KNOW IT SHE REPLIED IS THAT BLUE VEIN STILL IN MY TEMPLE THAT USED TO SHOW THERE THE SCAR MUST BE JUST UPON IT IF THE CUT HAD BEEN A LITTLE DEEPER IT WOULD HAVE SPILT
UNDER WHICH THE SCRAPE HAD TURNED THE COLOR OF AN UNRIPE BLACKBERRY PREVIOUS TO VANISHING ALTOGETHER WAIT A MOMENT THEN I'LL DAMP IT SAID FITZPIERS HE PUT HIS LIPS TO THE PLACE AND KEPT THEM THERE TILL THE PLASTER CAME OFF EASILY
AND EVERYTHING IN HIM AND IN NATURE TENDS TOWARD HEALTH SICKNESS CAN HAVE NO PLACE IN THE THOUGHT OF ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE FOR IT IS BY ITS OWN NATURE CONTINUALLY IMPELLED TOWARD THE FULLEST AND MOST PERFECT LIFE
ONE OF ASSUMPTION NOT OF REJECTION YOU ARE TO RECEIVE OR APPROPRIATE HEALTH RATHER THAN TO REJECT AND DENY DISEASE DENYING DISEASE ACCOMPLISHES NEXT TO NOTHING
THIS CONCEPTION OF HEALTH IS NOT A MENTAL PICTURE OF A PARTICULAR THING IT IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF HEALTH AND CARRIES WITH IT THE IDEA OF PERFECT FUNCTIONING IN EVERY PART AND ORGAN YOU MAY TRY TO PICTURE YOURSELF
BUT DO IT WITH THE HEALTH THOUGHT IN YOUR MIND DO NOT LET PEOPLE TELL THEIR WOES AND CATALOGUE THEIR SYMPTOMS TO YOU TURN THE CONVERSATION TO SOME OTHER SUBJECT OR EXCUSE YOURSELF AND GO BETTER BE CONSIDERED AN UNFEELING PERSON THAN TO HAVE THE DISEASE
NOTHING ESSENTIAL HAS BEEN OMITTED AND PRACTICALLY ALL THE SUPERFLUOUS HAS BEEN ELIMINATED THE SCIENCE OF BEING WELL IS AN EXACT SCIENCE LIKE ARITHMETIC NOTHING CAN BE ADDED TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND IF ANYTHING BE TAKEN FROM THEM
AND THAT HE SHOULD LIVE THE MOST COMPLETE LIFE POSSIBLE IN HIS PRESENT SPHERE OF ACTION THIS MUST BE SO BECAUSE THAT WHICH LIVES IN MAN IS SEEKING MORE LIFE GIVE A LITTLE CHILD A PENCIL AND PAPER
RESULTING FROM THE IMPERFECT THOUGHTS OF MEN PAST AND PRESENT IF MAN'S THOUGHTS OF HIMSELF HAD ALWAYS BEEN THOSE OF PERFECT HEALTH MAN COULD NOT POSSIBLY NOW BE OTHERWISE THAN PERFECTLY HEALTHY
AND PERFORM THE VOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF LIFE IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY MANNER YOUR STRENGTH WILL INCREASE FROM DAY TO DAY BUT FOR A TIME YOU MAY HAVE DAYS WHEN YOUR STRENGTH IS INSUFFICIENT FOR THE WORK YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO AT SUCH TIMES REST
BREATHE AND SLEEP IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY WAY AND THIS AS WE SHALL SHOW HE CAN DO WITHOUT STUDYING PHYSIOLOGY AT ALL THIS FOR THE MOST PART IS TRUE OF ALL HYGIENE
GOD THE FORMLESS SUBSTANCE DOES NOT SEE DISEASE THINK DISEASE KNOW DISEASE OR RECOGNIZE DISEASE DISEASE IS RECOGNIZED ONLY BY THE THOUGHT OF MAN
AND THESE FUNCTIONS ARE OF TWO CLASSES VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY
WHICH HAS CONTROL OVER ALL THE INVOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF HIS LIFE AND THE THOUGHT OF PERFECT HEALTH IMPRESSED UPON THIS PRINCIPLE WILL REACH EACH PART AND ORGAN MAN'S LIVER IS NOT CONTROLLED BY A LIVER PRINCIPLE
GET YOUR EXERCISE IN THE NATURAL WAY AS RECREATION NOT AS A FORCED STUNT FOR HEALTH'S SAKE ALONE RIDE A HORSE OR A BICYCLE PLAY TENNIS OR TENPINS OR TOSS A BALL HAVE SOME AVOCATION LIKE GARDENING
NO BETTER NOT WHEN YOU BEGIN TO LIVE IN THIS WAY YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT BE OF NORMAL STRENGTH AND YOU WILL GRADUALLY PASS FROM A LOW PHYSICAL CONDITION TO A HIGHER ONE IF YOU RELATE YOURSELF MENTALLY WITH HEALTH AND STRENGTH
ITS LIFE IS IN ALL AND ITS INTELLIGENCE IS IN ALL THIS SUBSTANCE CREATES BY THOUGHT AND ITS METHOD IS BY TAKING THE FORM OF THAT WHICH IT THINKS ABOUT THE THOUGHT OF A FORM HELD BY THIS SUBSTANCE
WITH FULL FAITH THAT GREAT STRENGTH IS AT HAND AND THEN GET UP AND GO ON AGAIN WHILE YOU REST DO NOT THINK OF YOUR PRESENT WEAKNESS THINK OF THE STRENGTH THAT IS COMING
I DID NOT SLEEP WELL LAST NIGHT I HAVE A PAIN IN MY SIDE I DO NOT FEEL AT ALL WELL TO DAY AND SO ON SAY I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP TO NIGHT
WHICH WILL RESULT IN ITS COMING INTO THE ATTITUDE AND FORM OF THE WORLD AND THESE MOTIONS ARE MADE WHEN IT WISHES TO CREATE AN OAK TREE IT THINKS OF THE SEQUENCES OF MOVEMENT
DO NOTHING READ HORACE FLETCHER ON THE A B Z OR OUR OWN NUTRITION AND GET THE FULL FORCE OF HIS EXPLANATION OF THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU LIVE ON THIS SCIENTIFIC PLAN YOU NEED NOT AND INDEED CANNOT
FOR THE ACTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH IS LARGELY DIRECTED BY MAN'S CONSCIOUS THOUGHT AFFECTING HIS SUB CONSCIOUS MIND MAN IS A THINKING CENTER CAPABLE
EXERCISE FOR FUN OR PROFIT EXERCISE BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO HEALTHY TO SIT STILL
BUT FOR COUNTLESS AGES MEN HAVE HELD THOUGHTS OF DISEASE ABNORMALITY OLD AGE AND DEATH AND THE PERVERTED FUNCTIONING RESULTING FROM THESE THOUGHTS HAS BECOME A PART OF THE INHERITANCE OF THE RACE
OF ALL MIND IS TOWARD HEALTH AND IF NO THOUGHTS ARE HELD IN THE CONSCIOUS MIND SAVE THOSE OF HEALTH ALL INTERNAL FUNCTIONING WILL COME TO BE PERFORMED IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY MANNER THE POWER OF NATURE WITHIN YOU IS SUFFICIENT
BUT HEALTH FROM ALL THE FOREGOING WE SEE THAT HEALTH IS A FACT OR TRUTH IN THE ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE FROM WHICH WE ARE ALL FORMED
HAVE AN EVACUATION OF THE BOWELS EVERY DAY AND THAT AN OPERATION IN FROM ONCE IN THREE DAYS TO ONCE IN TWO WEEKS IS QUITE SUFFICIENT FOR PERFECT HEALTH
THE PURPOSE OF NATURE SO FAR AS MAN IS CONCERNED IS THAT HE SHOULD BE CONTINUOUSLY ADVANCING INTO MORE LIFE AND PROGRESSING TOWARD PERFECT LIFE
WHATEVER LIVES MUST LIVE MORE AND MORE THE SEED LYING IN THE GRANARY HAS LIFE BUT IT IS NOT LIVING PUT IT INTO THE SOIL AND IT BECOMES ACTIVE
CHAPTER SIXTEEN SUPPLEMENTARY INSTRUCTIONS IN FORMING A CONCEPTION OF HEALTH IT IS NECESSARY TO THINK OF THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU WOULD LIVE AND WORK IF YOU WERE PERFECTLY WELL
BUT THE PERFORMANCES OF DOCTOR TANNER THE FORTY DAY FASTER AND THE WRITINGS OF DOCTOR DEWEY AND OTHERS ON THE FASTING CURE TOGETHER WITH THE EXPERIMENTS OF NUMBERLESS PEOPLE
SO THE IMPRESSION BECAME UNIVERSALLY DISSEMINATED THAT ONE WHO WAS DEPRIVED OF FOOD MUST DIE IN FROM FIVE TO TEN DAYS AND NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHEN CUT OFF FROM FOOD BY SHIPWRECK ACCIDENT OR FAMINE DID DIE WITHIN THIS PERIOD
WHICH FORMS A BODY OF MIND STUFF THIS MIND STUFF CONTROLS THE FUNCTIONING OF YOUR PHYSICAL BODY A THOUGHT OF DISEASE OR OF IMPERFECT FUNCTION IMPRESSED UPON THE MIND STUFF CAUSES DISEASE OR IMPERFECT FUNCTIONING IN THE PHYSICAL BODY
TO ENTIRELY BANISH FROM YOUR MEMORY ALL THAT YOU HAVE READ IN DOCTOR BOOKS AND PATENT MEDICINE ADVERTISEMENTS CONCERNING CONSTIPATION YOU NEED GIVE THE MATTER NO FURTHER THOUGHT AT ALL THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH WILL TAKE CARE OF IT
AND HE BEGINS TO DRAW CRUDE FIGURES THAT WHICH LIVES IN HIM IS TRYING TO EXPRESS ITSELF IN ART GIVE HIM A SET OF BLOCKS AND HE WILL TRY TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT WHICH LIVES IN HIM
AND THAT YOU HAVE CUT DOWN YOUR QUANTITY OF FOOD AND ARE REALLY EATING IN THE SCIENTIFIC WAY DISMISS CONSTIPATION FROM YOUR MIND FOREVER YOU HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH IT PUT YOUR TRUST IN THAT PRINCIPLE WITHIN YOU WHICH HAS THE POWER TO GIVE YOU PERFECT HEALTH
THAT ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE WORKS AND CREATES GOD MUST LIVE AND HE CANNOT LIVE EXCEPT AS HE CREATES AND INCREASES IN MULTIPLYING FORMS HE IS MOVING ON TO LIVE MORE
IN DUE TIME CAUSE PERFECT FUNCTIONING IN THE PHYSICAL BODY THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PHYSICAL BODY INTO THE IMAGE OF THE IDEAL HELD BY THE MIND BODY IS NOT ACCOMPLISHED INSTANTANEOUSLY
THERE ARE CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS WHICH WE SHOULD KNOW AND THESE WILL BE EXPLAINED IN LATER CHAPTERS BUT ASIDE FROM THESE PROPOSITIONS IGNORE PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE
AND YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF THE CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE PICTURE DOING THINGS IN JUST THAT WAY NEVER THINK OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WEAK OR SICKLY PEOPLE DO THINGS ALWAYS THINK OF THE WAY STRONG PEOPLE DO THINGS SPEND YOUR LEISURE TIME IN THINKING ABOUT THE STRONG WAY
MAN HOLDS IN HIS THOUGHT THE IDEA OF DISEASED AND ABNORMAL FUNCTIONING AND CONDITIONS AND SO PERVERTS THE ACTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH CAUSING DISEASED AND ABNORMAL FUNCTIONING
NO MATTER WHAT THEY THINK OR SAY POLITENESS DOES NOT REQUIRE YOU TO PERMIT YOURSELF TO BE POISONED BY DISEASED OR PERVERTED THOUGHT
AND RELATE YOURSELF TO THIS CONCEPTION IN WORD ACT AND ATTITUDE GUARD YOUR SPEECH MAKE EVERY WORD HARMONIZE WITH THE CONCEPTION OF PERFECT HEALTH NEVER COMPLAIN NEVER SAY THINGS LIKE THESE
WITH ALL ITS PRETENSIONS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE IS REALLY KNOWN AS TO THE INTERIOR WORKINGS AND PROCESSES OF THE BODY IT IS NOT KNOWN JUST HOW FOOD IS DIGESTED IT IS NOT KNOWN JUST WHAT PART FOOD PLAYS IF ANY
MAN IN PERFECT HEALTH IS THE THOUGHT OF ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE AND MAN IN IMPERFECT HEALTH IS THE RESULT OF HIS OWN FAILURE TO THINK PERFECT HEALTH AND TO PERFORM THE VOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF LIFE IN A HEALTHY WAY
AND EXERCISE GRATITUDE RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT YOUR STRENGTH IS GROWING RAPIDLY AND FEEL A DEEP THANKFULNESS TO THE LIVING ONE
UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY PHYSIOLOGY FIXED TEN DAYS AS THE EXTREME LIMIT OF MAN'S ENDURANCE WITHOUT FOOD IT WAS CONSIDERED THAT ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES COULD HE SURVIVE A LONGER FAST
ITS CAUSES OR POSSIBLE RESULTS AND SET YOURSELF TO THE WORK OF FORMING A CONCEPTION OF HEALTH THINK ABOUT HEALTH AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF HEALTH OF THE WORK THAT MAY BE DONE
WHAT TO THINK IN ORDER TO SEVER ALL MENTAL RELATIONS WITH DISEASE YOU MUST ENTER INTO MENTAL RELATIONS WITH HEALTH MAKING THE PROCESS POSITIVE NOT NEGATIVE
WHEN ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE WISHES TO CREATE A GIVEN FORM IT THINKS OF THE MOTIONS WHICH WILL PRODUCE THAT FORM WHEN IT WISHES TO CREATE A WORLD IT THINKS OF THE MOTIONS PERHAPS EXTENDING THROUGH AGES
LIFE BY LIVING INCREASES LIFE CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT INCREASING AND THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPULSE OF LIFE IS TO LIVE IT IS IN RESPONSE TO THIS FUNDAMENTAL IMPULSE
YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO FIND HOW EASILY YOU CAN CONQUER PAIN AND AFTER YOU HAVE LIVED FOR A TIME IN THIS SCIENTIFIC WAY PAINS AND ACHES WILL BE THINGS UNKNOWN TO YOU WHAT SHALL I DO WHEN I AM TOO WEAK FOR MY WORK
TO OVERCOME ALL HEREDITARY IMPRESSIONS AND IF YOU WILL LEARN TO CONTROL YOUR THOUGHTS SO THAT YOU SHALL THINK ONLY THOSE OF HEALTH
SUBSTANCE MOVES ALONG THE FIXED LINES OF GROWTH IT HAS ESTABLISHED AND THE IMPRESSION UPON IT OF THE HEALTH THOUGHT CAUSES THE HEALTHY BODY TO BE BUILT CELL BY CELL HOLDING ONLY THOUGHTS OF PERFECT HEALTH WILL ULTIMATELY CAUSE PERFECT FUNCTIONING
YOU CAN PICTURE YOURSELF AS DOING YOUR DAY'S WORK EASILY AND WITH SURPLUS VIGOR NEVER TIRED OR WEAK YOU CAN PICTURE IN YOUR MIND HOW ALL THINGS WOULD BE DONE BY A PERSON FULL OF HEALTH AND POWER
HAVE MADE IMPRESSIONS ON THIS MIND STUFF THESE MAY HAVE BEEN EITHER YOUR OWN THOUGHTS OR THOSE OF YOUR PARENTS WE BEGIN LIFE WITH MANY SUB CONSCIOUS IMPRESSIONS BOTH RIGHT AND WRONG BUT THE NATURAL TENDENCY
THAT WHICH LIVES IN MAN IS ALWAYS SEEKING TO LIVE MORE AND SINCE MAN LIVES MOST WHEN HE IS WELL THE PRINCIPLE OF NATURE IN HIM CAN SEEK ONLY HEALTH THE NATURAL STATE OF MAN IS A STATE OF PERFECT HEALTH
IT IS NOT NECESSARY OR ESSENTIAL HOWEVER TO HAVE A CLEAR MENTAL IMAGE OF YOURSELF AS YOU WISH TO BE IT IS ONLY ESSENTIAL TO FORM A CONCEPTION OF PERFECT HEALTH AND TO RELATE YOURSELF TO IT
WHO HAVE FASTED FROM FORTY TO SIXTY DAYS HAVE SHOWN THAT MAN'S ABILITY TO LIVE WITHOUT FOOD IS VASTLY GREATER THAN HAD BEEN SUPPOSED ANY PERSON PROPERLY EDUCATED CAN FAST FROM TWENTY
THERE IS NOT THE LEAST NEED OF DOING IT EXCEPT TO MAKE THE PROCESS OF YOUR MENTAL EMANCIPATION FROM FEAR A LITTLE EASIER IT MAY BE WORTH WHILE FOR THAT AND AS SOON AS YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS
HAS NO PLACE IN THE THOUGHT OF THE THINKING STUFF THE SUPREME MIND NEVER THINKS OF DISEASE DISEASE WAS NOT CREATED OR ORDAINED BY GOD OR SENT FORTH FROM HIM IT IS WHOLLY A PRODUCT OF SEPARATE CONSCIOUSNESS
AND FILLS THE INTERSPACES OF THE UNIVERSE IT IS THE LIFE OF ALL THE THOUGHT OF A FORM IN THIS SUBSTANCE CAUSES THE FORM THE THOUGHT OF A MOTION PRODUCES THE MOTION IN RELATION TO MAN
HUNGER WILL COME IN MUCH LESS TIME IN MOST LONG FASTS THE REASON HUNGER DOES NOT COME SOONER
TO FORTY DAYS WITH LITTLE LOSS IN WEIGHT AND OFTEN WITH NO APPARENT LOSS OF STRENGTH AT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO STARVED TO DEATH IN TEN DAYS OR LESS DID SO BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THAT DEATH WAS INEVITABLE
ALL RELATIONSHIP WITH DISEASE THE FIRST STEP IN THE SCIENCE OF BEING WELL IS THEN TO ENTER INTO COMPLETE THOUGHT CONNECTION WITH HEALTH
IT WILL CAUSE THE MOVEMENTS OF PERFECTLY HEALTHY FUNCTION WITHIN YOU HOLD WITH PERSISTENCE TO THE THOUGHT OF PERFECT HEALTH IN RELATION TO YOURSELF DO NOT PERMIT YOURSELF TO THINK IN ANY OTHER WAY
THE INVOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF MAN'S LIFE ARE UNDER THE DIRECT CONTROL OF THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH AND SO LONG AS MAN THINKS IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY WAY THESE FUNCTIONS ARE PERFECTLY PERFORMED
IN WHICH YOU CAN SPEND AN HOUR EVERY DAY WITH PLEASURE AND PROFIT THERE ARE A THOUSAND WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN GET EXERCISE ENOUGH TO KEEP YOUR BODY SUPPLE AND YOUR CIRCULATION GOOD AND YET NOT FALL INTO THE RUT OF EXERCISING FOR YOUR HEALTH
WHEN YOU LET PEOPLE TALK TO YOU OF SICKNESS YOU ASSIST THEM TO INCREASE AND MULTIPLY SICKNESS WHAT SHALL I DO WHEN I AM IN PAIN CAN ONE BE IN ACTUAL PHYSICAL SUFFERING AND STILL THINK ONLY THOUGHTS OF HEALTH YES DO NOT RESIST PAIN
AND FILLS THE INTERSPACES OF THE UNIVERSE WHILE ALL VISIBLE THINGS ARE MADE FROM IT YET THIS SUBSTANCE IN ITS FIRST FORMLESS CONDITION IS IN AND THROUGH ALL THE VISIBLE FORMS THAT IT HAS MADE
LET THE TIME BE AS LONG AS IT WILL AND THE SUB CONSCIOUS MIND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF POWERFUL AND POSITIVE SUGGESTION SUSPENDS HUNGER WHEN FOR ANY REASON NATURE TAKES AWAY YOUR HUNGER GO CHEERFULLY ON WITH YOUR USUAL WORK
OF ORIGINATING THOUGHT AND AS HE DOES NOT KNOW EVERYTHING HE MAKES MISTAKES AND THINKS ERROR NOT KNOWING EVERYTHING HE BELIEVES THINGS TO BE TRUE WHICH ARE NOT TRUE
HE HAS CAUSED IMPERFECT AND PERVERTED FUNCTIONING AND BY PERFORMING THE VOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF LIFE IN A PERVERTED MANNER HE HAS ASSISTED IN CAUSING DISEASE IF MAN WILL THINK ONLY THOUGHTS OF PERFECT HEALTH
WE WILL HERE ARRANGE IN A SYLLABUS THE BASIC TRUTHS OF THE SCIENCE OF BEING WELL THERE IS A THINKING SUBSTANCE FROM WHICH ALL THINGS ARE MADE AND WHICH IN ITS ORIGINAL STATE PERMEATES PENETRATES
AND AT ONCE BEGINS TO GATHER TO ITSELF FROM THE SURROUNDING SUBSTANCE AND TO BUILD A PLANT FORM IT WILL SO CAUSE INCREASE THAT A SEED HEAD WILL BE PRODUCED CONTAINING THIRTY SIXTY OR A HUNDRED SEEDS
AND HIS SECOND STEP TO LEARN HOW TO EAT DRINK BREATHE AND SLEEP IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY WAY IF MAN TAKES THESE TWO STEPS
AND PERFECT FUNCTIONING WILL IN DUE TIME PRODUCE A PERFECTLY HEALTHY BODY IT MAY BE AS WELL TO CONDENSE THIS CHAPTER INTO A SYLLABUS YOUR PHYSICAL BODY IS PERMEATED AND FITTED WITH AN INTELLIGENT SUBSTANCE
BY THE PATIENT HIMSELF HE BEGINS THE FAST WITH THE FEAR IF NOT ACTUALLY WITH THE HOPE THAT IT WILL BE MANY DAYS BEFORE HUNGER COMES THE LITERATURE HE HAS READ ON THE SUBJECT HAS PREPARED HIM TO EXPECT A LONG FAST AND HE IS GRIMLY DETERMINED TO GO TO A FINISH
THOUGHT FORCED UPON YOU WHEN YOU ARE IN COMPANY OF PEOPLE WHOSE CONVERSATIONAL STOCK IN TRADE IS SICKNESS AND KINDRED MATTERS IGNORE WHAT THEY SAY AND FALL TO OFFERING A MENTAL PRAYER OF GRATITUDE
THEREFORE TOWARD HEALTH MAN AS HE EXISTS IN THE THOUGHT OF THE FORMLESS SUBSTANCE HAS PERFECT HEALTH DISEASE WHICH IS ABNORMAL OR PERVERTED FUNCTION MOTION IMPERFECTLY MADE OR MADE IN THE DIRECTION OF IMPERFECT LIFE
WHICH IS CAUSING THE PAIN AND BE CERTAIN THAT THE PAIN WILL CEASE AS SOON AS THE GOOD WORK IS DONE FIX YOUR THOUGHTS WITH CONFIDENCE ON THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH WHICH IS MAKING SUCH CONDITIONS WITHIN YOU THAT PAIN WILL SOON BE UNNECESSARY
IS SEEKING EXPRESSION IN ARCHITECTURE SEAT HIM AT A PIANO AND HE WILL TRY TO DRAW HARMONY FROM THE KEYS THAT WHICH LIVES IN HIM IS TRYING TO EXPRESS ITSELF IN MUSIC
BUT WE DO NOT REALLY KNOW WHEN MAN BEGINS TO STUDY PHYSIOLOGY HE ENTERS THE DOMAIN OF THEORY AND DISPUTATION HE COMES AMONG CONFLICTING OPINIONS
BUT IF YOU LIVE IN THE MANNER WE HAVE DESCRIBED IT WILL BE OTHERWISE WITH YOU IF YOU EAT ONLY WHEN YOU HAVE AN EARNED HUNGER AND CHEW EVERY MOUTHFUL TO A LIQUID
IT DOES LITTLE GOOD TO CAST OUT THE DEVIL AND LEAVE THE HOUSE VACANT FOR HE WILL PRESENTLY RETURN WITH OTHERS WORSE THAN HIMSELF WHEN YOU ENTER INTO FULL AND CONSTANT MENTAL RELATIONS WITH HEALTH YOU MUST OF NECESSITY CEASE
WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE BEGINNING THEY ARE CHANGELESS CERTAIN MOTIONS INSTITUTED IN THE FORMLESS SUBSTANCE WILL FOREVER PRODUCE CERTAIN FORMS
OR PICTURE OF YOURSELF AS BEING WELL IMAGINING A PERFECTLY STRONG AND HEALTHY BODY AND TO SPEND SUFFICIENT TIME IN CONTEMPLATING THIS IMAGE TO MAKE IT YOUR HABITUAL THOUGHT OF YOURSELF
IN HARMONY WITH THIS CONCEPTION AND DO NOT DEPART FROM THIS ATTITUDE YOU MUST UNIFY YOURSELF IN THOUGHT WITH THE THING YOU DESIRE AND WHATEVER STATE OR CONDITION YOU UNIFY WITH YOURSELF IN THOUGHT
THE UNIVERSE IS A GREAT ADVANCING LIFE AND THE PURPOSE OF NATURE IS THE ADVANCEMENT OF LIFE TOWARD PERFECTION TOWARD PERFECT FUNCTIONING THE PURPOSE OF NATURE IS PERFECT HEALTH
I CAN SEE THAT I PROGRESS RAPIDLY AND THINGS OF SIMILAR MEANING
AND VERY STRONG TO IMAGINE YOURSELF DOING THINGS IN THE WAY OF A PERFECTLY WELL AND VERY STRONG PERSON UNTIL YOU HAVE A FAIRLY GOOD CONCEPTION OF WHAT YOU WOULD BE IF YOU WERE WELL THEN TAKE A MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ATTITUDE
UNLESS MAN PERFORMS THE EXTERNAL OR VOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF LIVING IN A HEALTHY MANNER MAN'S FIRST STEP MUST BE TO LEARN HOW TO THINK PERFECT HEALTH
ARE LONG CONTINUED FASTS NECESSARY SELDOM IF EVER THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH DOES NOT OFTEN REQUIRE TWENTY THIRTY OR FORTY DAYS TO GET READY FOR ACTION UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS
FIX YOUR MIND ON THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH WHICH IS BUILDING YOU INTO COMPLETE STRENGTH WHAT SHALL I DO ABOUT THAT GREAT BUGABOO WHICH SCARES MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO DEATH EVERY YEAR CONSTIPATION
MAN'S BODY IS FORMED FROM THE ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE AND IS THE RESULT OF CERTAIN MOTIONS WHICH FIRST EXISTED AS THOUGHTS OF ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE
AND CONDITIONS WITHIN HIS OWN BODY IN THE ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE THERE ARE HELD ONLY THE THOUGHTS OF PERFECT MOTION PERFECT AND HEALTHY FUNCTION COMPLETE LIFE GOD NEVER THINKS DISEASE OR IMPERFECTION
MENTAL HARMONY WITH THE POWER WHICH IS CAUSING THE PAIN ASSIST IT HELP IT ALONG DO NOT HESITATE WHEN NECESSARY TO USE HOT FOMENTATIONS AND SIMILAR MEANS TO FURTHER THE GOOD WORK WHICH IS GOING ON
AND IN SO FAR AS EVERYTHING WHICH IS CONNECTED WITH HEALTH IS CONCERNED YOUR WAY IS TO UNIFY YOURSELF WITH IT IN THOUGHT AND SPEECH THIS IS THE WHOLE THING IN A NUTSHELL MAKE YOURSELF ONE WITH HEALTH IN THOUGHT WORD AND ACTION
AND THERE WILL BE LITTLE ALMOST NOTHING
MAN DOES NOT HAVE TO STUDY ANATOMY OR PHYSIOLOGY SO THAT HE CAN FORM A MENTAL IMAGE OF EACH SEPARATE ORGAN AND ADDRESS HIMSELF TO IT HE DOES NOT HAVE TO TREAT HIS LIVER HIS KIDNEYS HIS STOMACH OR HIS HEART THERE IS ONE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH IN MAN
WILL SOON BECOME UNIFIED WITH YOU IN BODY THE SCIENTIFIC WAY IS TO SEVER RELATIONS WITH EVERYTHING YOU DO NOT WANT AND TO ENTER INTO RELATIONS WITH EVERYTHING YOU DO WANT FORM A CONCEPTION OF PERFECT HEALTH
KNOW THAT AS YOU THINK OF YOURSELF IN UNITY WITH THIS CONCEPTION THE ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE WHICH PERMEATES AND FILLS THE TISSUES OF YOUR BODY IS TAKING FORM ACCORDING TO THE THOUGHT AND KNOW THAT THIS INTELLIGENT
OF IMPERFECTION AND DISEASE THIS IS NOT NATURAL OR A PART OF THE PLAN OF NATURE THE PURPOSE OF NATURE CAN BE NOTHING ELSE THAN THE PERFECTION OF LIFE THIS WE SEE FROM THE VERY NATURE OF LIFE ITSELF
PERHAPS EXTENDING THROUGH AGES WHICH WILL RESULT IN THE FORM OF AN OAK TREE AND THESE MOTIONS ARE MADE THE PARTICULAR SEQUENCES OF MOTION BY WHICH DIFFERING FORMS SHOULD BE PRODUCED
ENTIRELY OR IN PART ARE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF MAN'S CONSCIOUS MIND AND HE CAN PERFORM THEM IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY WAY IF HE WILL IF HE DOES NOT PERFORM THEM IN A HEALTHY WAY
OF A MOTION CAUSES IT TO INSTITUTE THAT MOTION FORMS ARE CREATED BY THIS SUBSTANCE IN MOVING ITSELF INTO CERTAIN ATTITUDES OR POSITIONS
IF THE PAIN IS SEVERE LIE DOWN AND GIVE YOUR MIND TO THE WORK OF QUIETLY AND EASILY CO OPERATING WITH THE FORCE WHICH IS AT WORK FOR YOUR GOOD THIS IS THE TIME TO EXERCISE GRATITUDE AND FAITH BE THANKFUL FOR THE POWER OF HEALTH
HOLD THIS THOUGHT WITH PERFECT FAITH THAT IT IS THE FACT THE TRUTH IT IS THE TRUTH SO FAR AS YOUR MENTAL BODY IS CONCERNED YOU HAVE A MIND BODY AND A PHYSICAL BODY
A FAILURE WILL RESULT IF YOU FOLLOW STRICTLY THE WAY OF LIVING PRESCRIBED IN THIS BOOK YOU WILL BE WELL AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN FOLLOW THIS WAY BOTH IN THOUGHT AND ACTION RELATE NOT ONLY YOURSELF
HE CANNOT LONG BE WELL SO WE SEE THAT IF MAN THINKS IN A CERTAIN WAY AND EATS DRINKS BREATHES AND SLEEPS IN A CORRESPONDING WAY HE WILL BE WELL
RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS A GOOD THING PAIN IS CAUSED BY AN EFFORT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH TO OVERCOME SOME UNNATURAL CONDITION THIS YOU MUST KNOW AND FEEL WHEN YOU HAVE A PAIN
HIS STOMACH BY A DIGESTIVE PRINCIPLE AND SO ON THE PRINCIPLE OF HEALTH IS ONE THE LESS YOU GO INTO THE DETAILED STUDY OF PHYSIOLOGY THE BETTER FOR YOU OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS SCIENCE IS VERY IMPERFECT AND LEADS TO IMPERFECT THOUGHT
AND DO NOT CONNECT YOURSELF WITH SICKNESS EITHER BY THOUGHT WORD OR ACTION DO NOT READ DOCTOR BOOKS OR MEDICAL LITERATURE
AND IF YOU STOP EATING THE INSTANT YOU BEGIN TO BE CONSCIOUS OF AN ABATEMENT OF YOUR HUNGER YOU WILL SO PERFECTLY PREPARE YOUR FOOD FOR DIGESTION AND ASSIMILATION THAT PRACTICALLY ALL OF IT WILL BE TAKEN UP BY THE ABSORBENTS
SUBSTANCE OR MIND STUFF WILL CAUSE FUNCTION TO BE PERFORMED IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOUR BODY WILL BE REBUILT WITH PERFECTLY HEALTHY CELLS THE INTELLIGENT SUBSTANCE FROM WHICH ALL THINGS ARE MADE
AN ERRONEOUS PHYSIOLOGY HAD GIVEN THEM A WRONG THOUGHT ABOUT THEMSELVES WHEN A MAN IS DEPRIVED OF FOOD HE WILL DIE IN FROM TEN TO FIFTY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE WAY HE HAS BEEN TAUGHT OR IN OTHER WORDS
BUT SO FAR AS POSSIBLE ALL OTHERS IN YOUR THOUGHTS TO PERFECT HEALTH DO NOT SYMPATHIZE WITH PEOPLE WHEN THEY COMPLAIN OR EVEN WHEN THEY ARE SICK AND SUFFERING TURN THEIR THOUGHTS INTO A CONSTRUCTIVE CHANNEL IF YOU CAN DO ALL YOU CAN FOR THEIR RELIEF
YOU WILL SUFFER FROM NO WEAKNESS OR DISCOMFORT CAUSED BY ABSTINENCE WHEN YOU ARE NOT HUNGRY YOU WILL FEEL STRONGER HAPPIER AND MORE COMFORTABLE IF YOU DO NOT EAT THAN YOU WILL IF YOU DO EAT NO MATTER HOW LONG THE FAST
IT IS THE NATURE OF LIFE TO CONTINUALLY ADVANCE TOWARD MORE PERFECT LIVING ADVANCEMENT IS THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF THE VERY ACT OF LIVING INCREASE IS ALWAYS THE RESULT OF ACTIVE LIVING
ACCORDING TO THE WAY HE THINKS ABOUT IT SO YOU SEE THAT AN ERRONEOUS PHYSIOLOGY CAN WORK VERY MISCHIEVOUS RESULTS NO SCIENCE OF BEING WELL CAN BE FOUNDED ON CURRENT PHYSIOLOGY IT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY EXACT IN ITS KNOWLEDGE
PERMEATES AND PENETRATES ALL THINGS AND SO IT IS IN AND THROUGH YOUR BODY IT MOVES ACCORDING TO ITS THOUGHTS AND SO IF YOU HOLD ONLY THE THOUGHTS OF PERFECTLY HEALTHY FUNCTION
TO FORM A DISTINCT MENTAL PICTURE OF THEMSELVES IN A PERFECT OR IDEALIZED BODY IT IS MUCH EASIER AS IN THE SCIENCE OF GETTING RICH TO FORM A MENTAL IMAGE OF THE THINGS ONE WANTS TO HAVE
THE THOUGHTS OF THIS SUBSTANCE ARE ALWAYS OF PERFECT FUNCTIONING AND PERFECT HEALTH MAN IS A THINKING CENTER CAPABLE OF ORIGINAL THOUGHT AND HIS THOUGHT HAS POWER OVER HIS OWN FUNCTIONING BY THINKING IMPERFECT THOUGHTS
AND ARE PERFORMED IN A PERFECTLY HEALTHY MANNER SO LONG AS MAN THINKS IN A CERTAIN WAY THE VOLUNTARY FUNCTIONS OF LIFE ARE EATING DRINKING BREATHING AND SLEEPING THESE
RELATE IT BY YOUR REVERENT GRATITUDE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE WHICH IS ALL POWER AND GO ON YOUR WAY REJOICING WHAT ABOUT EXERCISE EVERY ONE IS THE BETTER FOR A LITTLE ALL ROUND USE OF THE MUSCLES EVERY DAY
THIS IS NOT SO EASY AS IT SOUNDS IT NECESSITATES THE TAKING OF CONSIDERABLE TIME FOR MEDITATION AND NOT ALL PERSONS HAVE THE IMAGING FACULTY WELL ENOUGH DEVELOPED
OUR ANCESTORS HAVE FOR MANY GENERATIONS HELD IMPERFECT IDEAS CONCERNING HUMAN FORM AND FUNCTIONING AND WE BEGIN LIFE WITH RACIAL SUB CONSCIOUS IMPRESSIONS
THE MIND BODY TAKES FORM JUST AS YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AND ANY THOUGHT WHICH YOU HOLD CONTINUOUSLY IS MADE VISIBLE BY THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PHYSICAL BODY INTO ITS IMAGE IMPLANTING THE THOUGHT OF PERFECT FUNCTIONING IN THE MIND BODY WILL
IN THE GENERATION OF FORCE IT IS NOT KNOWN EXACTLY WHAT THE LIVER SPLEEN AND PANCREAS ARE FOR OR WHAT PART THEIR SECRETIONS PLAY IN THE CHEMISTRY OF ASSIMILATION ON ALL THESE AND MOST OTHER POINTS WE THEORIZE
AND HE IS BOUND TO FORM MISTAKEN IDEAS CONCERNING HIMSELF THESE MISTAKEN IDEAS LEAD TO THE THINKING OF WRONG THOUGHTS AND THIS LEADS TO PERVERTED FUNCTIONING AND DISEASE ALL THAT THE MOST PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF PHYSIOLOGY COULD DO FOR MAN
AND DO NOT EAT UNTIL SHE GIVES IT BACK NO MATTER IF IT IS TWO THREE TEN DAYS OR LONGER YOU MAY BE PERFECTLY SURE THAT WHEN IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO EAT YOU WILL BE HUNGRY AND IF YOU ARE CHEERFULLY CONFIDENT AND KEEP YOUR FAITH IN HEALTH
AND THE PLEASURES THAT MAY BE ENJOYED IN A CONDITION OF PERFECT HEALTH THEN MAKE THIS CONCEPTION YOUR GUIDE IN THINKING OF YOURSELF REFUSE TO ENTERTAIN FOR AN INSTANT ANY THOUGHT OF YOURSELF WHICH IS NOT IN HARMONY WITH IT
CAST IT OUT INSTANTLY BY CALLING UP A THOUGHT WHICH IS IN HARMONY WITH THE CONCEPTION OF HEALTH THINK OF YOURSELF AT ALL TIMES AS REALIZING CONCEPTION AS BEING A STRONG AND PERFECTLY HEALTHY PERSONAGE AND DO NOT HARBOR A CONTRARY THOUGHT
I UNDERSTOOD HIS FEAR A GIGANTIC SHADOW APPEARED ABOVE THE POOR DIVER IT WAS A SHARK OF HUGE SIZE MOVING IN DIAGONALLY EYES ABLAZE JAWS WIDE OPEN I WAS SPEECHLESS WITH HORROR
I STARED WILD EYED I SAW THE FIGHT ENTER A NEW PHASE THE CAPTAIN FELL TO THE SEAFLOOR TOPPLED BY THE ENORMOUS MASS WEIGHING HIM DOWN THEN THE SHARK'S JAWS OPENED ASTOUNDINGLY WIDE LIKE A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL SHEARS
WHEN I SHARED THESE IMPRESSIONS WITH HIM HE ANSWERED ME IN A TONE TOUCHED WITH EMOTION THAT INDIAN PROFESSOR LIVES IN THE LAND OF THE OPPRESSED AND I AM TO THIS DAY AND WILL BE UNTIL MY LAST
HE FELL TO HIS KNEES AND STUFFED HIS SACK WITH SHELLFISH GATHERED AT RANDOM
I GOT UP QUICKLY DRESSED AND WENT INTO THE LOUNGE CAPTAIN NEMO WAS WAITING FOR ME PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE SAID TO ME ARE YOU READY TO START I'M READY KINDLY FOLLOW ME
AROUND OUR LONGBOAT BUT PAYING NO ATTENTION TO US THEY POUNCED ON THE CORPSE AND QUARRELED OVER EVERY SCRAP OF IT BY EIGHT THIRTY WE WERE BACK ON BOARD THE NAUTILUS THERE I FELL TO THINKING ABOUT THE INCIDENTS THAT MARKED OUR EXCURSION
WERE GENUINELY INEXHAUSTIBLE SINCE NATURE'S CREATIVE POWERS ARE GREATER THAN MAN'S DESTRUCTIVE INSTINCTS TRUE TO THOSE INSTINCTS NED LAND GREEDILY STUFFED THE FINEST OF THESE MOLLUSKS
WHOSE AFTERSHOCKS KNOCKED CONSEIL OFF HIS FEET MEANWHILE NED LAND PULLED THE CAPTAIN CLEAR UNINJURED THE LATTER STOOD UP WENT RIGHT TO THE INDIAN QUICKLY CUT THE ROPE BINDING THE MAN TO HIS STONE
TO THE NAUTILUS HE SAID THE LONGBOAT FLEW OVER THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES LATER WE ENCOUNTERED THE SHARK'S CORPSE AGAIN FLOATING FROM THE BLACK MARKINGS ON THE TIPS OF ITS FINS
AS FOR THE RUHMKORFF DEVICE IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE IN THE PICTURE BEFORE INSERTING MY HEAD INTO ITS COPPER CAPSULE I COMMENTED ON THIS TO THE CAPTAIN OUR LIGHTING EQUIPMENT WOULD BE USELESS TO US THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED ME
I STARED AT MY COMPANIONS THEY WERE ARMED IN THE SAME FASHION
LITTLE BY LITTLE HE OPENED HIS EYES HOW STARTLED HE MUST HAVE FELT HOW FRIGHTENED EVEN AT SEEING FOUR HUGE COPPER CRANIUMS LEANING OVER HIM AND ABOVE ALL
THEN WITH HIS HANDS HE RAISED THE FRINGED MEMBRANE FILLED TUNIC THAT MADE UP THE ANIMAL'S MANTLE THERE
THE SUN'S RAYS PIERCED THE CLOUD CURTAIN GATHERED ON THE EASTERLY HORIZON AND THE RADIANT ORB ROSE SWIFTLY I COULD CLEARLY SEE THE SHORE WHICH FEATURED A FEW SPARSE TREES HERE AND THERE
WE WALKED FOR HALF AN HOUR UNTIL WE ENCOUNTERED THE ANCHOR CONNECTING THE SEAFLOOR WITH THE NAUTILUS'S SKIFF BACK ON BOARD THE SAILORS HELPED DIVEST US OF OUR HEAVY COPPER CARAPACES CAPTAIN NEMO'S FIRST WORDS WERE SPOKEN TO THE CANADIAN
REPOSITIONED ITSELF ON ITS BELLY AND HEADED SWIFTLY TOWARD HIM I CAN SEE CAPTAIN NEMO'S BEARING TO THIS DAY BRACING HIMSELF HE WAITED FOR THE FEARSOME MAN EATER
AND WERE TEN OR MORE YEARS OLD
THEIR BRIGHTNESS MIGHT UNEXPECTEDLY ATTRACT CERTAIN DANGEROUS OCCUPANTS OF THESE WATERWAYS AS CAPTAIN NEMO PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS I TURNED TO CONSEIL AND NED LAND
NEAR SEVEN O'CLOCK WE FINALLY SURVEYED THE BANK OF SHELLFISH WHERE PEARL OYSTERS REPRODUCE BY THE MILLIONS
SLIGHTLY ROUNDED TRIANGLE ROBBER CRABS EXCLUSIVE TO THESE WATERWAYS AND HORRIBLE PARTHENOPE CRABS WHOSE APPEARANCE WAS REPULSIVE TO THE EYE ONE ANIMAL NO LESS HIDEOUS WHICH I ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL TIMES
FIVE METERS AWAY A SHADOW APPEARED AND DROPPED TO THE SEAFLOOR THE ALARMING IDEA OF SHARKS CROSSED MY MIND BUT I WAS MISTAKEN
INTO A NET HE CARRIED AT HIS SIDE BUT WE COULDN'T STOP WE HAD TO FOLLOW THE CAPTAIN
OVER THE MANNAR OYSTERBANK TWO IMPRESSIONS INEVITABLY STOOD OUT ONE CONCERNED CAPTAIN NEMO'S MATCHLESS BRAVERY
NONE OF THE NAUTILUS'S MEN WERE TO GO WITH US ON THIS NEW EXCURSION
WE WON'T BE GOING VERY DEEP AND THE SUN'S RAYS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO LIGHT OUR WAY BESIDES IT'S UNWISE TO CARRY ELECTRIC LANTERNS UNDER THESE WAVES
A PEARL WORTH TEN MILLION NIGHT FELL I WENT TO BED I SLEPT PRETTY POORLY MAN EATERS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN MY DREAMS AND I FOUND IT MORE OR LESS APPROPRIATE
I HAVEN'T LET THE NAUTILUS PULL TOO NEAR THE COAST AND WE'RE FAIRLY WELL OUT
I SAW A LOOSE PEARL AS BIG AS A COCONUT ITS GLOBULAR SHAPE PERFECT CLARITY AND WONDERFUL ORIENT
OARS IN POSITION FIVE OF THE NAUTILUS'S SAILORS WERE WAITING FOR US ABOARD THE SKIFF WHICH WAS MOORED ALONGSIDE THE NIGHT WAS STILL DARK LAYERS OF CLOUDS CLOAKED THE SKY AND LEFT ONLY A FEW STARS IN VIEW
BELLOWED SO TO SPEAK BLOOD WAS POURING INTO THE WAVES FROM ITS WOUNDS
THIS MAGNIFICENT BENEFACTION FROM THE MAN OF THE WATERS TO THE POOR INDIAN FROM CEYLON WAS ACCEPTED BY THE LATTER WITH TREMBLING HANDS HIS BEWILDERED EYES INDICATED
IN THE MIDST OF THIS MOVING VEGETATION UNDER ARBORS OF WATER PLANTS THERE RACED LEGIONS OF CLUMSY ARTICULATES IN PARTICULAR SOME FANGED FROG CRABS
WITH CIRCULAR SHELLS AWL SHAPED AUGER SHELLS
HERE UNDER THESE CLEAR WAVES THIS CRAB RACED AROUND WITH MATCHLESS AGILITY WHILE GREEN TURTLES FROM THE SPECIES FREQUENTING THE MALABAR COAST MOVED SLUGGISHLY AMONG THE CRUMBLING ROCKS
PULLED UP HIS STONE AND STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN THE WHOLE PROCESS LASTING ONLY THIRTY SECONDS THIS DIVER DIDN'T SEE US A SHADOW CAST BY OUR CRAG HID US FROM HIS VIEW AND BESIDES
AND WE SET FOOT ON LEVEL SAND IN A METER AND A HALF OF WATER
FOLLOWING THE PRACTICE USED IN MOST NAVIES WHILE THE LONGBOAT COASTED DROPS OF LIQUID FLICKED FROM THE OARS AND HIT THE DARK TROUGHS OF THE WAVES PITTER PATTERING LIKE SPLASHES OF MOLTEN LEAD
NO WITH A GESTURE HE ORDERED US TO CROUCH BESIDE HIM AT THE FOOT OF A WIDE CREVICE
SOME OF THESE SHELLS WERE FURROWED WITH FLAKY GREENISH BANDS THAT RADIATED DOWN FROM THE TOP THESE WERE THE YOUNG OYSTERS THE OTHERS HAD RUGGED BLACK SURFACES MEASURED UP TO FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS IN WIDTH
I WOULD SOON FIND OUT AFTER GOING DOWN A FAIRLY STEEP SLOPE OUR FEET TROD THE FLOOR OF A SORT OF CIRCULAR PIT
AND WE'LL BEGIN OUR STROLL I DIDN'T REPLY AND WHILE STARING AT THESE SUSPICIOUS WAVES I BEGAN TO PUT ON MY HEAVY AQUATIC CLOTHES HELPED BY THE LONGBOAT'S SAILORS
HE ALLOWED IT TO GROW IMPERCEPTIBLY WITH EACH PASSING YEAR THE MOLLUSK'S SECRETIONS ADDED NEW CONCENTRIC LAYERS THE CAPTAIN ALONE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE CAVE WHERE THIS WONDERFUL FRUIT OF NATURE WAS RIPENING
CONSEIL LOOKED AT IT WITH PURELY SCIENTIFIC FASCINATION AND I'M SURE HE PLACED IT NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON IN THE CLASS
YOU OBSERVE THIS CONFINED BAY A MONTH FROM NOW IN THIS VERY PLACE THE NUMEROUS FISHING BOATS OF THE HARVESTERS WILL GATHER AND THESE ARE THE WATERS THEIR DIVERS WILL RANSACK SO DARINGLY THIS
I APPROACHED THIS PHENOMENAL MOLLUSK ITS MASS OF FILAMENTS ATTACHED IT TO A TABLE OF GRANITE
NOT YET DISTURBED BY DIVERS AT WORK WE WALKED BY OURSELVES GENUINE LOITERERS STOPPING OR STRAYING AS OUR FANCIES DICTATED FOR MY PART I WAS NO LONGER WORRIED ABOUT THOSE DANGERS MY IMAGINATION HAD SO RIDICULOUSLY EXAGGERATED
BUT MY TWO FRIENDS HAD ALREADY ENCASED THEIR CRANIUMS IN THEIR METAL HEADGEAR AND THEY COULD NEITHER HEAR NOR REPLY
AND TO THOSE SHIMMERING IN THE CAPTAIN'S COLLECTION I ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS WORTH AT LEAST TEN MILLION FRANCS IT WAS A SUPERB NATURAL CURIOSITY RATHER THAN A LUXURIOUS PIECE OF JEWELRY
AMONG OTHER SPECIMENS IN THESE TWO BRANCHES I NOTED SOME WINDOWPANE OYSTERS WITH THIN VALVES OF UNEQUAL SIZE A TYPE OF OSTRACOD
HAD NOT NED LAND QUICK AS THOUGHT RUSHED FORWARD WITH HIS HARPOON AND DRIVEN ITS DREADFUL POINT INTO THE SHARK'S UNDERSIDE THE WAVES WERE SATURATED WITH MASSES OF BLOOD
THE THREE OF US FOLLOWED HIM AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER MIRACULOUSLY SAFE WE REACHED THE FISHERMAN'S LONGBOAT CAPTAIN NEMO'S FIRST CONCERN WAS TO REVIVE THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN I WASN'T SURE HE WOULD SUCCEED
ORDER CHONDROPTERYGIA WITH FIXED GILLS
COMING FROM WELL OUT A MILD SWELL MADE THE SKIFF ROLL GENTLY AND A FEW CRESTING BILLOWS LAPPED AT ITS BOW WE WERE SILENT WHAT WAS CAPTAIN NEMO THINKING
LAMP SHELLS EDIBLE DUCK CLAMS THAT FEED THE HINDU MARKETPLACE SUBTLY LUMINOUS JELLYFISH
HIS MOVEMENTS WERE SYSTEMATICALLY EXECUTED AND FOR HALF AN HOUR NO DANGER SEEMED TO THREATEN HIM
NOTHING ELSE UNTIL THE MOMENT WHEN
BY STICKING UNDER THE MOLLUSK'S FOLDS SOME PIECE OF GLASS OR METAL THAT WAS GRADUALLY COVERED WITH MOTHER OF PEARL IN ANY CASE COMPARING THIS PEARL TO OTHERS I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT
I SAW THE DARING CAPTAIN CLINGING TO ONE OF THE ANIMAL'S FINS FIGHTING THE MONSTER AT CLOSE QUARTERS BELABORING HIS
BETWEEN US AND THE SHORE THE SEA WAS DESERTED NOT A BOAT NOT A DIVER PROFOUND SOLITUDE REIGNED OVER THIS GATHERING PLACE OF PEARL FISHERMEN AS CAPTAIN NEMO HAD COMMENTED
IT WAS A MAN A LIVING MAN A BLACK INDIAN FISHERMAN A POOR DEVIL WHO NO DOUBT HAD COME TO GATHER WHAT HE COULD BEFORE HARVEST TIME I SAW THE BOTTOM OF HIS DINGHY MOORED A FEW FEET ABOVE HIS HEAD
BECAUSE HE HAD TO TEAR THEM FROM THE BANKS WHERE EACH CLUNG WITH ITS TOUGH MASS OF FILAMENTS AND HOW MANY OF THESE OYSTERS FOR WHICH HE RISKED HIS LIFE WOULD HAVE NO PEARL IN THEM I OBSERVED HIM WITH GREAT CARE
A HOLY WATER FONT THAT COULD HAVE HELD A WHOLE LAKE A BASIN MORE THAN TWO METERS WIDE HENCE EVEN BIGGER THAN THE ONE ADORNING THE NAUTILUS'S LOUNGE
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY FEMALE EAR THAT COULD HANDLE IT OUR VISIT TO THIS OPULENT GIANT CLAM CAME TO AN END
THERE ROSE UNDERFOOT SCHOOLS OF UNUSUAL FISH FROM THE GENUS MONOPTERUS WHOSE MEMBERS HAVE NO FIN
A REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT RACE FROM WHICH HE HAD FLED BENEATH THE SEAS IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING THIS STRANGE MAN HADN'T YET SUCCEEDED IN COMPLETELY STIFLING HIS HEART
THE SHALLOWS DREW NOTICEABLY CLOSER TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND SOON WALKING IN ONLY A METER OF WATER MY HEAD PASSED WELL ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE OCEAN CONSEIL REJOINED ME
EDIBLE FISH THAT WHEN DRIED AND MARINATED MAKE AN EXCELLENT DISH KNOWN BY THE NAME
AND WE PULLED CLEAR THE SKIFF HEADED SOUTHWARD THE OARSMEN TOOK THEIR TIME I WATCHED THEIR STROKES VIGOROUSLY CATCH THE WATER AND THEY ALWAYS WAITED TEN SECONDS BEFORE ROWING AGAIN
COVERING THREE QUARTERS OF THE HORIZON FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHWEST GOING UP CEYLON'S WEST COAST DURING THE NIGHT THE NAUTILUS LAY WEST OF THE BAY
CONTRARY TO THE CANADIAN'S VIEWS IN WHICH IT STILL SEEMED TOO FAR AWAY AS FOR CONSEIL HE HAD COME ALONG OUT OF SIMPLE CURIOSITY
THEN FOLLOWING THE CAPTAIN'S EXAMPLE I LET MYSELF BE CROWNED WITH MY HEAVY COPPER SPHERE AND OUR AIR TANKS IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO ACTION AN INSTANT LATER THE LONGBOAT'S SAILORS HELPED US OVERBOARD ONE AFTER THE OTHER
EAVESDROPPING ON HIS MOVEMENTS NOT MISSING A SINGLE DETAIL OF HIS FISHING SO HE WENT UP AND DOWN SEVERAL TIMES HE GATHERED ONLY ABOUT TEN SHELLFISH PER DIVE
WHAT ABOUT OUR WEAPONS I ASKED HIM OUR RIFLES RIFLES WHAT FOR DON'T YOUR MOUNTAINEERS ATTACK BEARS DAGGER IN HAND AND ISN'T STEEL SURER THAN LEAD HERE'S A STURDY BLADE SLIP IT UNDER YOUR BELT AND LET'S BE OFF
A DIRECT HIT TO THE HEART IN ITS STRUGGLES THE MAN EATER CHURNED THE WATERY MASS SO FURIOUSLY ITS EDDIES THREATENED TO KNOCK ME OVER I WANTED TO RUN TO THE CAPTAIN'S RESCUE BUT I WAS TRANSFIXED WITH HORROR UNABLE TO MOVE
I DISTINGUISHED THE UNPREDICTABLY CONTOURED SPRINGINGS OF A VAULT SUPPORTED BY NATURAL PILLARS FIRMLY BASED ON A GRANITE FOUNDATION LIKE THE WEIGHTY COLUMNS OF TUSCAN ARCHITECTURE WHY HAD OUR INCOMPREHENSIBLE GUIDE
THAT WOMB FOR PEARLS WHOSE VALVES ARE NEARLY EQUAL IN SIZE HAS THE SHAPE OF A ROUND SHELL WITH THICK WALLS
WHO JUMPED ASIDE AND AVOIDED THE SHARK'S BITE BUT NOT THE THRASHING OF ITS TAIL BECAUSE THAT TAIL STRUCK HIM ACROSS THE CHEST AND STRETCHED HIM OUT ON THE SEAFLOOR THIS SCENE LASTED BARELY A FEW SECONDS THE SHARK RETURNED ROLLED OVER ON ITS BACK
DEFINED THE UPPER LINES OF THE COAST WITH GREATER DISTINCTNESS FAIRLY FLAT TO THE EAST IT SWELLED A LITTLE TOWARD THE SOUTH
AND FINALLY SOME WONDERFUL OCULINA FLABELLIFORMA MAGNIFICENT SEA FANS THAT
WHOSE BODIES ARE COVERED WITH SCALY ARMOR DIVIDED INTO EIGHT LENGTHWISE SECTIONS MEANWHILE AS THE SUN GOT PROGRESSIVELY HIGHER IT LIT UP THE WATERY MASS MORE AND MORE THE SEAFLOOR CHANGED LITTLE BY LITTLE
WHICH THRASHED ABOUT WITH INDESCRIBABLE FURY NED LAND HADN'T MISSED HIS TARGET THIS WAS THE MONSTER'S DEATH RATTLE PIERCED TO THE HEART IT WAS STRUGGLING WITH DREADFUL SPASMS
IT WAS MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE FEET LONG ITS ENORMOUS MOUTH OCCUPIED A THIRD OF ITS BODY IT WAS AN ADULT AS COULD BE SEEN FROM THE SIX ROWS OF TEETH FORMING AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE IN ITS UPPER JAW
AND THE MANY STRANGE SIGHTS CAPTIVATED MY IMAGINATION THE SUN WAS ALREADY SENDING SUFFICIENT LIGHT UNDER THESE WAVES THE TINIEST OBJECTS REMAINED VISIBLE AFTER TEN MINUTES OF WALKING
THEN SOME SEA POACHERS FISH BELONGING TO THE GENUS
AND GLUING HIS HUGE COPPER CAPSULE TO MINE HIS EYES GAVE ME A FRIENDLY GREETING BUT THIS LOFTY PLATEAU MEASURED ONLY A FEW FATHOMS AND SOON WE REENTERED OUR ELEMENT I THINK I'VE NOW EARNED THE RIGHT TO DUB IT THAT TEN MINUTES LATER
CARRIED AWAY BY CURIOSITY I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND TO TAKE IT WEIGH IT FONDLE IT BUT THE CAPTAIN STOPPED ME SIGNALED NO REMOVED HIS DAGGER IN ONE SWIFT MOTION
WHO WAS STATIONED BESIDE ME SUDDENLY STOOD UP THEN HE STRODE RIGHT TOWARD THE MONSTER DAGGER IN HAND READY TO FIGHT IT AT CLOSE QUARTERS JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO SNAP UP THE POOR FISHERMAN THE MAN EATER SAW ITS NEW ADVERSARY
THANK YOU MISTER LAND HE TOLD HIM TIT FOR TAT CAPTAIN NED LAND REPLIED I OWED IT TO YOU THE GHOST OF A SMILE GLIDED ACROSS THE CAPTAIN'S LIPS AND THAT WAS ALL
BUT ITS CHAIN BARELY RAN BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LAY NO MORE THAN A METER DOWN AND THIS LOCALITY WAS ONE OF THE SHALLOWEST SPOTS
I ESTIMATED THE WEIGHT OF THIS GIANT CLAM AT THREE HUNDRED KILOGRAMS HENCE SUCH AN OYSTER HELD FIFTEEN KILOS OF MEAT AND YOU'D NEED THE STOMACH OF KING GARGANTUA TO EAT A COUPLE DOZEN
A MONTH TOO SOON AT SIX O'CLOCK THE DAY BROKE SUDDENLY WITH THAT SPEED UNIQUE TO TROPICAL REGIONS
SERVED TO LOWER HIM MORE QUICKLY TO THE OCEAN FLOOR THIS WAS THE EXTENT OF HIS EQUIPMENT
HOW COULD THIS POOR INDIAN EVER HAVE GUESSED THAT HUMAN BEINGS CREATURES LIKE HIMSELF
BAY IS FELICITOUSLY LAID OUT FOR THEIR TYPE OF FISHING IT'S SHELTERED FROM THE STRONGEST WINDS AND THE SEA IS NEVER VERY TURBULENT HERE HIGHLY FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR DIVING WORK NOW LET'S PUT ON OUR UNDERWATER SUITS
WHOSE ANTENNAS AND TUBULAR TENTACLES WERE INCREDIBLY LONG JUST THEN A HUGE CAVE OPENED UP IN OUR PATH HOLLOWED FROM A PICTURESQUE PILE OF ROCKS WHOSE SMOOTH HEIGHTS WERE COMPLETELY HUNG WITH UNDERWATER FLORA
AND WHEN I LIFTED MY ARMS SOMETIMES THEY WOULD PASS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SEA THEN THE LEVEL OF THE OYSTERBANK WOULD LOWER UNPREDICTABLY OFTEN WE WENT AROUND TALL POINTED ROCKS RISING LIKE PYRAMIDS
CAPTAIN NEMO TOOK ME TO THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY WHOSE STEPS LED TO THE PLATFORM NED AND CONSEIL WERE THERE
BUT I HAVE THE SKIFF READY AND IT WILL TAKE US TO THE EXACT SPOT WHERE WE'LL DISEMBARK WHICH WILL SAVE US A PRETTY LONG TREK IT'S CARRYING OUR DIVING EQUIPMENT
THE SKIFF ADVANCED TOWARD MANNAR ISLAND WHICH CURVED TO THE SOUTH CAPTAIN NEMO STOOD UP FROM HIS THWART AND STUDIED THE SEA AT HIS SIGNAL THE ANCHOR WAS LOWERED
FOUND SEATS IN THE STERN OF THE SKIFF THE LONGBOAT'S COXSWAIN TOOK THE TILLER
WE FOLLOWED HIM DOWN A GENTLE SLOPE AND DISAPPEARED UNDER THE WAVES THERE THE OBSESSIVE FEARS IN MY BRAIN LEFT ME I BECAME SURPRISINGLY CALM AGAIN THE EASE WITH WHICH I COULD MOVE INCREASED MY CONFIDENCE
AND I THOUGHT HIS SOLE REASON FOR LEADING US TO THIS LOCALITY
I HOPED SO SINCE THE POOR DEVIL HADN'T BEEN UNDER VERY LONG BUT THAT STROKE FROM THE SHARK'S TAIL COULD HAVE BEEN HIS DEATHBLOW
HAS ITS LINGUISTIC ROOTS IN THE WORD REQUIEM THE NEXT DAY AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
WHEN ALL AT ONCE JUST AS THE INDIAN WAS KNEELING ON THE SEAFLOOR I SAW HIM MAKE A FRIGHTENED GESTURE
WHAT ABOUT MY COMPANIONS CAPTAIN THEY'VE BEEN ALERTED AND ARE WAITING FOR US AREN'T WE GOING TO PUT ON OUR DIVING SUITS I ASKED NOT YET
AIMING THEIR LONG LEGS LIKE HEAVY ARTILLERY WATCHED US WITH UNBLINKING EYES WHILE UNDERFOOT THERE CREPT MILLIPEDES BLOODWORMS
AND WHEN THE LATTER RUSHED AT HIM THE CAPTAIN LEAPED ASIDE WITH PRODIGIOUS QUICKNESS AVOIDED A COLLISION AND SANK HIS DAGGER INTO ITS BELLY BUT THAT WASN'T THE END OF THE STORY A DREADFUL BATTLE WAS JOINED
THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW TO WHAT SUPERHUMAN CREATURES HE OWED BOTH HIS LIFE AND HIS FORTUNE AT THE CAPTAIN'S SIGNAL WE RETURNED TO THE BANK OF SHELLFISH AND RETRACING OUR STEPS
WE WERE IN FIVE METERS OF WATER AND THE TERRAIN HAD BECOME ALMOST FLAT
I RECOGNIZED THE DREADFUL SQUALUS MELANOPTERUS FROM THE SEAS OF THE EAST INDIES
WITH SUCH WONDERFUL DYE SPIKY PERIWINKLES FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS LONG THAT ROSE UNDER THE WAVES LIKE HANDS READY TO GRAB YOU TURBAN SNAILS WITH SHELLS MADE OF HORN
ON THE CURRENT CONDITION OF THIS GIANT CLAM THE MOLLUSK'S TWO VALVES WERE PARTLY OPEN
AT FIRST THIS CAVE LOOKED PITCH BLACK TO ME INSIDE THE SUN'S RAYS SEEMED TO DIMINISH BY DEGREES THEIR HAZY TRANSPARENCY WAS NOTHING MORE THAN DROWNED LIGHT CAPTAIN NEMO WENT IN WE FOLLOWED HIM
A GENUINE EIGHT DECIMETER SERPENT WITH A BLUISH GRAY BELLY WHICH WITHOUT THE GOLD LINES OVER ITS FLANKS COULD EASILY BE CONFUSED WITH THE CONGER EEL FROM THE BUTTERFISH GENUS WHOSE OVAL BODIES ARE VERY FLAT
UNDER THESE DARK WATERS THERE STRETCHED THE BANK OF SHELLFISH AN INEXHAUSTIBLE FIELD OF PEARLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILES LONG
HE ALONE REARED IT SO TO SPEAK IN ORDER TO TRANSFER IT ONE DAY TO HIS DEARLY BELOVED MUSEUM PERHAPS FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLES OF OYSTER FARMERS IN CHINA AND INDIA HE HAD EVEN PREDETERMINED THE CREATION OF THIS PEARL
THEN NOBODY WOULD KNOW ME SYLVIA HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE FINE COOKIES SHE WAS HOLDING ESTRALLA BY THE ARM AND TALKING VERY RAPIDLY ESTRALLA WAS ALMOST FRIGHTENED AT SYLVIA'S EAGERNESS YAS MISSY BUT WHAT FOR DO YOU WANTER GO SHE ASKED
SHE KNEW SHE MUST HAVE COME A LONG DISTANCE BUT COULD NOT TELL IF IT WAS FIVE MILES OR FIFTY SHE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW BUT THE SCENERY WAS STRANGE TO HER AS SHE SAT THERE SHE REVIEWED WHAT HAD PASSED HER MIND BECOMING CLEARER AS SHE THOUGHT
BREATHING HARD LINK SLIPPED BACK THE COVER OF THE DARK LANTERN
AND WISHED THAT THEY COULD AGAIN VISIT THE PLANTATION PHILIP HAD BROUGHT SYLVIA A LETTER FROM FLORA THANKING HER FOR THE LOCKET AND HOPING THAT THEY WOULD SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN PHILIP HAD NOT COME INTO THE HOUSE HE SEEMED MUCH OLDER TO SYLVIA THAN HE DID ON HER VISIT TO THE PLANTATION IN OCTOBER
AND TOOK FROM HIS POCKET SEVERAL SHEETS OF PAPER CLOSELY AND CARELESSLY WRITTEN UPON IN PENCIL THE FIRST SHEET WAS HEADED DYING CONFESSION OF MARGARET LANGMORE A FINE FORGERY IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF HE MUSED
THEN HE LOOKED AROUND TO SEE THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER WATER AROUND THE BUILDING WHEN SHE ROUSES UP SHE WILL BE DRY AND SHE WILL DRINK THIS HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF HALF A GLASS WILL DO THE WORK AND SHE WILL NEVER BOTHER ME OR ANYBODY ELSE ANY MORE HE PAUSED AGAIN
SAID MISSUS CLEAR NERVOUSLY IT'S AN AWFUL SITUATION AND SHE MOVED STEALTHILY ACROSS THE FLOOR TO THE WINDOW THERE WAS A FAINT GASLIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE WATCHERS COULD SEE HER FIGURE AND PROFILE BLACK AGAINST THE SLIGHT ILLUMINATION
CONTINUED THE OLD NEGRO FOR IT WAS A TIME WHEN THE COLORED PEOPLE WERE EAGER AND HOPEFUL FOR SOME NEWS THAT MIGHT PROMISE THEM THEIR FREEDOM SYLVIA KNEW THAT MISSUS CARLETON WAS WORRIED AND UNHAPPY IT WAS KNOWN IN CHARLESTON THAT FORT SUMTER WAS NEAR THE END OF ITS FOOD SUPPLIES
YOU CAN WRITE A LETTER TO MISSUS CARLETON AND WE WILL TAKE IT SUGGESTED SYLVIA AND THEN SHE TOLD HIM UNCLE PETER'S NEWS THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SENDING SHIPS TO THE AID OF THE FORT THAT IS GREAT NEWS SAID THE CAPTAIN IF IT IS ONLY TRUE WE MAY KEEP THE FORT FOR THE UNION
YOU ARE GOING TO HAND ME OVER TO THE THE AUTHORITIES NEVER COME I WON'T HURT YOU HE LED THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS ACROSS A SMALL STREAM AND PAST A SPOT WHERE SOME WILD BERRIES GREW THEN THEY STRUCK A TRAIL LEADING UP A HILLSIDE THE PLACE WAS NEW TO HER
AND NOW CAME TO ESCORT THE BARRISTER ACROSS LUCIAN PUT ON HIS HAT AT ONCE AND THE TWO WALKED OUT INTO THE DARK NIGHT FOR DARK IT WAS WITH NO MOON FEW STARS AND A GREAT MANY CLOUDS A MOST SATISFACTORY NIGHT FOR THEIR PURPOSE ALL THE BETTER
I'LL GIVE HER SOME OF IT NOW AND MAKE SURE HE RAISED UP THE ALMOST LIFELESS GIRL AND FORCED OPEN HER LIPS THEN HE TOOK THE GLASS AND POURED HALF THE CONTENTS DOWN HER THROAT
AND THEREFORE WAS WITHOUT A FRIEND IN THE WORLD SAVE DIANA LATER ON SHE WAS ADMITTED TO BAIL AND DIANA TOOK HER TO THE HOTEL IN KENSINGTON THERE TO WAIT FOR THE ARRIVAL OF MISTER CLYNE HIS ABSENCE AND SILENCE WERE BOTH UNACCOUNTABLE I HOPE NOTHING IS WRONG WITH POPPA
WHEN SYLVIA SAID THAT HER NAME WAS SYLVIA FULTON AND THAT SHE HAD COME TO SEE CAPTAIN CARLETON A SENTRY EXCLAIMED
AND THEY CAME UP UNDER THE WALLS OF FORT SUMTER WITHOUT A HINDRANCE THE SENTRIES AT THE FORT HAD WATCHED THE LITTLE CRAFT WITH ANXIOUS EYES WONDERING IF IT COULD BE BRINGING ANY MESSAGE BUT WHEN THE SOLDIERS LOOKED DOWN AT THE TWO LITTLE NEGRO GIRLS THEY LAUGHED IN SPITE OF THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT
AND AUNT CONNIE ROLLED HER EYES AND LIFTED HER HANDS AS IF SHE COULD ALREADY TASTE ITS RICHNESS ALL THAT AFTERNOON SYLVIA COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE PROPOSED TRIP SHE SAT WITH MISSUS CARLETON A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE SUPPER AND TOLD HER OF WHAT UNCLE PETER HAD SAID THAT SHIPS FROM THE NORTH WERE ON THE WAY TO THE AID OF FORT SUMTER
SAID LINK IN A LOW IMPATIENT VOICE WE WILL RUSH OUT SHOULD HE PROVE DANGEROUS
HE SAID PLEASANTLY I WAS AFRAID YOUR RUNNING AWAY WOULD HURT YOU I I MUST THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME MISTER STYLES SHE ANSWERED OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT MISS MARGARET I'D DO AS MUCH FOR YOU ANY DAY I THINK IT'S A BLOOMIN SHAME THE WAY YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED
CURSE HER AND HER BEAUTY HE WAITED AND AS SHE DID NOT RETURN TO CONSCIOUSNESS HE PICKED HER UP AND PLACED HER ON THE BED THEN HE HURRIED OUTSIDE GO BACK TO THE HOUSE HE SAID TO THE OLD WOMAN YOU'LL NOT BE NEEDED HERE ANY MORE
OUT OF THE DARKNESS STARTED A PALE FACE WITH WHITE HAIR AND LONG WHITE BEARD LUCIAN UTTERED A CRY MISTER VRAIN HE SAID SHRINKING BACK MISTER VRAIN
SYLVIA WAS THE FIRST ONE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE THE NEXT MORNING AND WAS DELIGHTED WHEN HER MOTHER SAID THAT SHE AND MISSUS CARLETON WERE INVITED TO LUNCHEON AT THE HOUSE OF A FRIEND AUNT CONNIE AND ESTRALLA WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU MISSUS FULTON ADDED AND SYLVIA FELT HER FACE FLUSH

OH ESTRALLA IF THE MEN ARE HUNGRY WE COULD CARRY THEM SOMETHING TO EAT BUT MOST OF ALL I WANT TO SEE CAPTAIN CARLETON AND GET SOME MESSAGE FOR HIS WIFE SHE IS SO UNHAPPY TO GO AWAY WITHOUT A WORD COME LONG DOWN IN DE GARDEN SAID ESTRALLA
SHE WRUNG HER HANDS AND HIS DARK EYES SEEMED TO PIERCE HER VERY SOUL SHE FELT FAINT AND SANK ON A BENCH COME WILL YOU ACCEPT MARGARET NO NO I CANNOT BUT THINK OF WHAT IS BEFORE YOU
SAID LUCIAN KISSING HER IT'S AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NOBODY ANY GOOD SO DIANA PLAYED THE PART OF A GOOD SAMARITAN TOWARDS HER STEPMOTHER AND HELPED HER TO BEAR THE EVIL OF BEING THRUST INTO PRISON LYDIA WROTE TO HER FATHER IN PARIS BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY

AND WRENT ABSENT IN THE SAME WAY FROM MISSUS BENSUSAN'S HOUSE IN JERSEY STREET APPEARED STRANGE AND ARGUED A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO AGAIN THE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND UNACCOUNTABLE ON THE WHOLE LUCIAN WAS NOT SATISFIED IN HIS MIND AS TO WHAT WOULD BE THE END OF THE MATTER
OUT OF YOUR HEAD HE INTERRUPTED I KNOW WHAT IS BEST AND YOU MUST DO AS I SAY COME ON AND HE PULLED HER FORWARD BY THE HAND WHERE TO NOT VERY FAR I I DO NOT WISH TO GO TO YOUR HOME I'LL NOT TAKE YOU THERE DON'T FEAR
AS THE MAN ENTERED THE ROOM MARGARET AROSE AND FACED HIM THE ENGLISHMAN WAS WELL DRESSED AND NEWLY SHAVEN AND WORE A ROSEBUD IN HIS BUTTONHOLE EVIDENTLY HE HAD SPENT SOME TIME OVER HIS TOILET IN HONOR OF THE OCCASION I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU UP AND LOOKING SO WELL

THAT YOU BEGGED ME TO LET YOU GET AWAY THAT YOU EVEN SAID YOU WOULD MARRY ME IF I WOULD AID YOU WHAT THEN EVERYBODY WILL THINK YOU GUILTY AND RAYMOND CASE WILL NEVER COME NEAR YOU AGAIN YOU
CRIED THE MAN WITH A SNARL AND MADE A DASH AT THE WOMAN WITH A CRY FOR HELP SHE ELUDED HIM AND SPRANG TOWARDS THE BEDROOM DOOR FOR PROTECTION THE NEXT MOMENT THE FOUR WATCHERS WERE IN THE ROOM WRESTLING WITH WRENT WHEN HE FELT THE GRIP OF THEIR HANDS AND KNEW THAT HE WAS BETRAYED
HE CRIED OUT SAVAGELY AND FOUGHT WITH THE STRENGTH OF TWO MEN HOWEVER HE COULD DO LITTLE AGAINST HIS FOUR ADVERSARIES AND WORN OUT WITH THE STRUGGLE COLLAPSED SUDDENLY ON TO THE DUSTY FLOOR WITH A MOTION OF DESPAIR LOST LOST HE MUTTERED ALL LOST
SO SHE SAID GOOD BYE AND PHILIP WALKED DOWN THE PATH AND WAVED HIS CAP TO HER AS HE REACHED THE GATE IT HAD BEEN MANY WEEKS SINCE THE BUTTERFLY HAD SAILED ABOUT CHARLESTON HARBOR BUT THE LITTLE BOAT WAS IN THE CHARGE OF AN OLD NEGRO WHO TOOK GOOD CARE OF IT THE NEGRO KNEW SYLVIA
MISSUS CARLETON'S SMILE VANISHED SYLVIA REALIZED THAT THIS KIND FRIEND WAS TROUBLED AND WISHED WITH ALL HER HEART THAT SHE COULD SAY TO MORROW I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT CAPTAIN CARLETON BUT SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST KEEP SILENT UNTIL SHE HAD CARRIED OUT HER PLAN
AND HAD HE KNOWN MISSUS CLEAR'S ADDRESS HE WOULD HAVE GONE TO QUESTION HER ABOUT IT BUT ONLY LINK KNEW WHERE THE WOMAN WAS TO BE FOUND AND KEPT THAT INFORMATION TO HIMSELF ESPECIALLY FROM DENZIL NOW THAT HE HAD THE REINS ONCE MORE IN HIS HANDS HE DID NOT INTEND THAT THE BARRISTER SHOULD TAKE THEM AGAIN
PEACOCK GAVE IT TO ME THIS MORNING THE SCENE WILL BE QUITE DRAMATIC I HOPE IT WON'T PROVE TO BE VRAIN SAID LUCIAN RESTLESSLY FOR HE THOUGHT HOW GRIEVED DIANA WOULD BE I HOPE NOT ANSWERED LINK CURTLY BUT THERE'S NO KNOWING
I SWEAR I AM NOT MARGARET MARRY ME AND I WILL CLEAR YOU AS SURELY AS THE SUN IS SHINING AND IF I REFUSE HE CAME AND CAUGHT HER BY THE ARM HIS FACE BLAZING WITH SUDDEN PASSION DO NOT DARE TO DO THAT
IF YOU GO BACK DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WILL DO THEY WILL SURELY HANG YOU OH MERCIFUL HEAVEN DO NOT SAY THAT I WOULDN'T IF IT WASN'T SO BUT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE CORONER AND THE CHIEF OF POLICE AND THEY HAVE ALL OF THE EVIDENCE AS STRAIGHT AS A STRING
THERE APPEARED A MESSAGE FROM WRENT THAT HE WOULD MEET MISSUS CLEAR AT NO THIRTEEN GENEVA SQUARE LINK WAS DELIGHTED WHEN MISSUS CLEAR SHOWED HIM THIS AND RUBBED HIS HANDS WITH MUCH PLEASURE AFFAIRS WERE ABOUT TO BE BROUGHT TO A CRISIS
A PERSON WHO WOULD KNOW ALL ABOUT THE DRUG WITH WHICH YOUR FATHER AND MISSUS LANGMORE WERE KILLED WHO WAS IT WILL YOU CONSENT TO MARRY ME TELL ME FIRST NO AFTERWARDS YOU ARE FOOLING ME
SHE MURMURED WHO COULD HAVE BEEN SO WICKED AS TO TAKE YOUR LIFE AN HOUR WENT BY AND SHE PREPARED TO LEAVE THE COTTAGE WHEN A SHADOW FELL ACROSS THE WINDOW AND MATLOCK STYLES APPEARED HE SPOKE A FEW LOW WORDS TO THE OLD WOMAN AND THE LATTER WALKED AWAY
PUNCTUAL TO THE MINUTE LINK IN A STATE OF SUBDUED EXCITEMENT CAME TO LUCIAN'S ROOMS ALREADY HE HAD SENT HIS TWO POLICEMEN OVER TO THE HOUSE INTO WHICH HE HAD INSTRUCTED THEM TO ENTER IN THE QUIETEST AND MOST UNOSTENTATIOUS MANNER
SHE SAID PRESENTLY AND CAME TO A HALT TO A PLACE WHERE YOU WILL BE SAFE THAT ISN'T ANSWERING THE QUESTION WE'LL BE THERE IN A FEW MINUTES AND THEN YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF MARGARET CANNOT YOU TRUST ME GIRL I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU
MARGARET'S STRENGTH GAVE OUT AND SUDDENLY SHE SANK DOWN ON HER KNEES ALL IN ARE YOU HE SAID NOT UNKINDLY AND STOOPING HE PICKED HER UP BODILY SHE TRIED TO RESIST BUT COULD NOT AND HE TOOK HER INTO THE COTTAGE AND PLACED HER ON A COUCH I'LL GET YOU A NURSE

CAN YOU TRUST MISSUS CLEAR ABSOLUTELY SHE KNOWS ON WHICH SIDE HER BREAD IS BUTTERED HER ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING FREE FROM HER SHARE OF THE MATTER IS TO TURN QUEEN'S EVIDENCE AND SHE INTENDS TO DO SO WHAT DID SHE SAY ABOUT VRAIN BEING WRENT WELL SIR
I WANT TO HELP YOU HE CAME CLOSER AT WHICH SHE RETREATED A STEP THANK YOU BUT I DO NOT SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO I MUST GO BACK AND GIVE MYSELF UP I I WAS NOT MYSELF WHEN I RAN AWAY IT WAS A VERY FOOLISH THING TO DO
I AM GLAD ALSO SAID THE VOICE HARSHLY AS I WISH TO KNOW WHY YOU PROPOSE TO BETRAY ME BECAUSE YOU WON'T PAY ME THE MONEY SAID MISSUS CLEAR BOLDLY AND IF YOU DON'T GIVE IT TO ME THIS VERY NIGHT I'LL GO STRAIGHT AND TELL THE POLICE ALL ABOUT MY HUSBAND I'LL KILL YOU FIRST
DECLARED ESTRALLA SMILINGLY I'LL GO AND THANK HER MYSELF SAID SYLVIA TAKING THE PLATE AND OFFERING ONE OF THE COOKIES TO ESTRALLA UNCLE PETE HE SAY AS DE SOLDIERS AT FORT SUMTER MUS BE GETTIN HUNGRY SAID THE LITTLE COLORED GIRL
LOOK AGAIN SAID LINK PASSING HIS HAND RAPIDLY OVER THE FACE AND HEAD OF THE PROSTRATE MAN
DIANA HAD NEVER LIKED LYDIA
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR LYDIA YOUR FATHER WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT HIS HOME FOR A LUNATIC ASYLUM NOR WOULD CLEAR HAVE BEEN MURDERED
I AM GIVING YOU EVERYTHING I HAVE MY WEALTH MY HONOR EVERYTHING CAN A MAN DO MORE THAN THAT I LOVE YOU LOVE YOU MORE THAN RAYMOND CASE EVER DID OR WILL
REPLIED LINK IN THE SAME TONE MYSELF MISTER DENZIL AND TWO POLICEMEN KEEP THE MAN IN TALK AND FIND OUT IF POSSIBLE IF HE COMMITTED THE MURDER I HOPE HE WON'T KILL ME MUTTERED MISSUS CLEAR HE WILL IF HE KNOWS I'VE BETRAYED HIM THAT WILL BE ALL RIGHT
AND LINK WITH LUCIAN WAITED NEAR THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE SITTING ROOM SO AS TO BE READY FOR MISSUS CLEAR
MAT YOU ALWAYS WERE A PLUM WITH THE PEN I'LL ADD A LINE TELLING WHERE SHE CAN BE FOUND AND THEN SEND IT TO THE CORONER THAT WILL BE BETTER THAN LEAVING IT AROUND HERE SHE MIGHT FIND IT BEFORE SHE DRANK THAT DOSE HE PAUSED AGAIN PERHAPS SHE WON'T DRINK IT AFTER ALL
AND HE KNEW THAT IT WAS THROUGH HER INTEREST IN ESTRALLA THAT THE LITTLE NEGRO GIRL AND HER MOTHER HAD BEEN GIVEN THEIR FREEDOM NOW AND THEN HE APPEARED AT AUNT CONNIE'S KITCHEN AND ONE WARM DAY TOWARD THE LAST OF MARCH WHEN SYLVIA WAS WANDERING ABOUT THE GARDEN SHE SAW UNCLE PETER GOING UP THE WALK TO THE REAR OF THE HOUSE
HELD FIRMLY TO THE IDEA THAT HER FATHER COULD NOT BEHAVE IN SUCH A WAY AND AS A SENSIBLE WOMAN SHE DID NOT THINK THAT A MAN WITH SO FEW OF HIS SENSES ABOUT HIM COULD HAVE ACTED THE DUAL PART WITH WHICH HE WAS CREDITED WITHOUT IN SOME MEASURE BETRAYING HIMSELF
IF I TRIED TO ESCAPE THEY WOULD SOON BE ON MY TRACK NO I CAN PREVENT THAT HOW BECAUSE THE WORLD WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE INNOCENT SHE GAVE A START AND LOOKED AT HIM WILDLY PLEADINGLY THEN YOU KNOW THE REAL MURDERER
YOU HAD BETTER THINK THIS MATTER OVER I DO NOT WANT TO THINK IT OVER MY MIND IS MADE UP I SHALL NEVER MARRY YOU NEVER NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I LOATHE AND DESPISE YOU THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE AND HIS DARK FACE TURNED A SICKLY WHITE
BUT IT HAPPENED THAT UNCLE PETER HAD BEEN SENT ON AN ERRAND TO A DISTANT PART OF THE TOWN AND BEFORE HE RETURNED THE BUTTERFLY WAS WELL DOWN THE HARBOR ONCE OR TWICE A GUARD BOAT PASSED THEM CLOSELY ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE ONLY TWO COLORED CHILDREN IN THE BOAT
I'LL SEE TO IT THAT YOU ESCAPE THAT YOU ARE NEVER BOTHERED ANY MORE HOW CAN YOU DO THAT NEVER MIND HOW IT CAN BE DONE PROMISE TO GIVE UP CASE AND BE MY WIFE AND I WILL ATTEND TO ALL OF THE REST AND I'LL PROMISE YOU MORE THAN THAT LISTEN
ALL WAS STILL AND SILENT AS THE GRAVE WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR DREARY WATCH THE MINUTES PASSED SLOWLY IN THE DARKNESS AND THERE WAS AN UNBROKEN SILENCE SAVE FOR THE BREATHING OF THE WATCHERS AND THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF MISSUS CLEAR NEAR THE WINDOW
CAPTAIN CARLETON MUST STAY AND PERHAPS FIGHT TO DEFEND THE FLAG SHE REPLIED I WISH WE COULD LEAVE AT ONCE BUT WE MUST STAY AS LONG AS WE CAN SYLVIA LISTENED SOBERLY SHE WONDERED WHAT HER MOTHER WOULD SAY IF SHE KNEW OF HER PROMISE TO MISSUS CARLETON
AND CLEARER THEY PAUSED AT THE DOOR AND THEN MOVED TOWARDS THE WINDOW WHERE MISSUS CLEAR WAS STANDING IS THAT YOU SAID A LOW VOICE WHICH CAME WEIRDLY OUT OF THE DARKNESS YES
HOWEVER IF THE OLD MAN DOES GET INTO TROUBLE HE CAN PLEAD INSANITY HIS HAVING BEEN IN THE ASYLUM OF JORCE IS A STRONG CARD FOR HIM TO PLAY GOOD DAY MISTER DENZIL I'LL SEE YOU TO NIGHT AT NINE O'CLOCK SHARP GOOD DAY REPLIED LUCIAN
BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY AND SOON HURRIED TO THE CABIN WHERE ESTRALLA WAS WAITING FOR HER IT WAS STILL EARLY IN THE FORENOON WHEN TWO LITTLE NEGRO GIRLS
AND RUDDER IN HAND WAS STEERING THE BOAT OUT TOWARD THE CHANNEL TWO OR THREE MEN IN UNIFORM WATCHED THE LITTLE DARKIES AS THEY SUPPOSED BOTH THE GIRLS TO BE WITH AMUSEMENT NEGRO CHILDREN WERE ALWAYS PLAYING ABOUT AND NO ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THEM MY LANDY WHISPERED ESTRALLA
I'M SURE HE WILL BE OVER SOON WHILE SHE WAS THUS WAITING FOR HER FATHER AND LINK IN EVERY WAY WAS SEEKING EVIDENCE AGAINST HER MISSUS CLEAR RECEIVED AN ANSWER TO HER MESSAGE IN THE SAME COLUMN OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND IN THE SAME CYPHER
THEN IN A BURST OF RAGE HE CAUGHT HER BY THE THROAT AND THREW HER BACKWARD TO THE FLOOR SHE OFFERED NO RESISTANCE AND PAUSING IN HIS MADNESS HE REALIZED THAT SHE HAD SWOONED AWAY FAINTED HE HISSED BETWEEN HIS SET TEETH I WISH SHE WAS DEAD
THAT SHE NEARLY UPSET THE PLATE OF COOKIES COULD WE OH ESTRALLA COULD WE REALLY SHE EXCLAIMED ESTRALLA LOOKED AT HER LITTLE MISTRESS WITH WONDERING EYES YAS COURSE NOBODY'D MIND TWO LEETLE NIGGER GALS BUT YOU AIN'T BLACK MISSY
SAID LINK CASTING A LOOK ROUND THE DESERTED SQUARE ALL THE BETTER FOR OUR LITTLE GAME I WISH TO SECURE THIS FELLOW AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE HERE'S THE DOOR OPEN IN WITH YOU MISTER DENZIL
LUCIAN COULD NOT FORBEAR POINTING OUT THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN DIANA'S PAST SENTIMENTS AND HER PRESENT ACTIONS BUT MISS VRAIN WAS QUITE READY WITH AN EXCUSE I AM ONLY DOING MY DUTY SHE SAID IN HERSELF I LIKE LYDIA AS LITTLE AS EVER I DID
SHE FELT MUCH STRONGER THAN WHEN AT THE HOME OF MARTHA SAMPSON IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD EXPERIENCED IN RUNNING AWAY SHE SANK DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR TO THINK MATTERS OVER HOW FAR WAS SHE FROM SIDHAM
I WISH YOU AND I COULD TAKE CAPTAIN CARLETON SOME OF THESE COOKIES RESPONDED SYLVIA IF YOU WAS BLACK LIKE I IS WE COULD GO A SAILIN RIGHT OFF TO DE FORT IN PLAIN DAYLIGHT SAID ESTRALLA SYLVIA SPRANG TO HER FEET SO QUICKLY
SO I WISH TO HELP HER IF POSSIBLE AND AFTER ALL ADDED DIANA SHE IS MY FATHER'S WIFE AS IF THAT FACT EXTENUATED ALL HE HAS REASON TO KNOW IT REPLIED LUCIAN BITTERLY
LUCIAN WAS SOMEWHAT OF THIS OPINION HIMSELF YET HE HAD AN UNEASY FEELING THAT VRAIN MIGHT PROVE TO BE THE CULPRIT THE FACT OF VRAIN'S BEING OFTEN AWAY FROM MISSUS CLEAR'S HOUSE IN BAYSWATER
SHE REMEMBERED THE SCENE AT THE INQUEST AND REMEMBERED HOW SHE HAD FAINTED AND HOW RAYMOND HAD SUPPORTED HER AND TAKEN HER TO THE NURSE'S HOUSE THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW THE CORONER'S JURY HAD ACCUSED HER OF THE TERRIBLE CRIME AND SHE GAVE A DEEP SHUDDER POOR DEAR FATHER
AND AS LINK WAS THE MOVING SPIRIT IN THE MATTER HIS VANITY WAS SUFFICIENTLY GRATIFIED AS TO MAKE HIM QUITE AMIABLE WE'VE GOT HIM THIS TIME MISTER DENZIL HE SAID WITH ENTHUSIASM YOU AND I AND A COUPLE OF POLICEMEN WILL GO DOWN TO THAT HOUSE IN GENEVA SQUARE BY THE FRONT SIR BY THE FRONT
H'AR'S DE HOT WATER AND ESTRALLA HURRIED OFF TO HELP SYLVIA SCRUB OFF THE STICKY SOOT WHICH HAD SO WELL DISGUISED HER AND WHEN MISSUS FULTON AND MISSUS CARLETON RETURNED THEY FOUND A VERY ROSY FACED SMILING LITTLE GIRL ON THE PORCH ALL READY TO TELL THEM OF HER TRIP TO FORT SUMTER
AND WHEN SHE ROUSED UP ONCE MORE AN OLD WOMAN WAS AT MARGARET'S SIDE SHE HAD ADMINISTERED SOME SORT OF DRUG WHAT THE GIRL DID NOT KNOW AND IT HAD PUT HER INTO A SOUND SLEEP WHEN MARGARET LOOKED AROUND AGAIN
CHAPTER TWENTY NINE A GLASS OF POISON MARGARET COULD DO NOTHING BUT STARE AT THE MAN BEFORE HER HE WAS HEAVY SET AND POWERFUL AND WONT TO HAVING HIS OWN WAY MISTER STYLES SHE BEGAN BUT HE PUT HIS HAND OVER HER MOUTH YOU ARE SICK
PERHAPS SHE WON'T ASK ME BUT IF I COULD GO AND SEE CAPTAIN CARLETON AND TELL HIM THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BOSTON WITH US AND THEN BRING HER BACK A MESSAGE I KNOW SHE'D BE HAPPIER THOUGHT THE LITTLE GIRL
TO TAKE A MESSAGE TO FORT SUMTER IF MISSUS CARLETON SHOULD ASK HER TO DO SO THE WARM DAYS OF EARLY MARCH MADE THE SOUTHERN CITY FULL OF FRAGRANCE AND BEAUTY MANY FLOWERS WERE IN BLOOM THE HEDGES WERE GREEN AND THE AIR SOFT AND WARM SYLVIA AND GRACE OFTEN SPOKE OF FLORA
WILL HIDE IN WHAT WAS THE BEDROOM AND LISTEN TO WHAT WRENT HAS TO SAY TO MISSUS CLEAR WE'LL GIVE HIM ROPE ENOUGH TO HANG HIMSELF SIR AND THEN POUNCE OUT AND NAB HIM WELL HE WON'T SHOW MUCH FIGHT IF HE IS MISTER VRAIN I DON'T BELIEVE HE IS MISTER VRAIN RETORTED THE DETECTIVE BLUNTLY
I'LL PUT CITRON AN RAISINS AN CURRANTS IN IT AN BUTTER
MISSUS CLEAR ALSO QUESTIONED LUCIAN WISHING TO BE ENLIGHTENED ON ALL POINTS NO SHE'LL COME IN BY THE BACK DOWN THE CELLARWAY AS WRENT EXPECTS HER TO COME THEN HE'LL FOLLOW IN THE SAME PATH AND WALK RIGHT INTO THE TRAP BUT WON'T THE TWO BE SEEN CLIMBING OVER THAT FENCE IN THE DAYTIME
APPEARED AT THE WHARF WHERE THE BUTTERFLY WAS MOORED UNCLE PETER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN BUT HE HAD JUST LEFT THE BOAT WHOSE SAIL HAD NOT EVEN BEEN LOWERED AND THE TWO GIRLS HURRIED ON BOARD IN A MOMENT SYLVIA HAD UNFASTENED THE ROPE PUSHED THE BOAT CLEAR OF THE LANDING
LINK HAD A DARK LANTERN WHICH HE USED CAREFULLY SO THAT NO LIGHT COULD BE SEEN FROM THE WINDOW LOOKING ON TO THE SQUARE AND WITH HIS THREE COMPANIONS HE WENT INTO THE BACK ROOM WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN USED BY CLEAR AS A SLEEPING APARTMENT HERE THE TWO POLICEMEN STATIONED THEMSELVES IN ONE CORNER
SHE CALLED AND RAN TO ASK HIM ABOUT THE BOAT UNCLE PETER HAD A GREAT DEAL OF NEWS TO TELL HE SAID THAT UNLESS MAJOR ANDERSON AND HIS SOLDIERS LEFT FORT SUMTER AT ONCE THAT ALL THE FORTS AND THE NEW BATTERIES BUILT BY THE CONFEDERATES WOULD OPEN FIRE UPON SUMTER AND DESTROY IT
IN A WHISPER HE CONVERSED WITH LINK HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING OF THAT GIRL RHODA HE ASKED WE HAVE TRACED HER TO BERKSHIRE WHISPERED LINK SHE WENT BACK TO HER GYPSY KINSFOLK YOU KNOW I DARE SAY WE'LL MANAGE TO LAY HANDS ON HER SOONER OR LATER
THEN CAN'T CAPTAIN CARLETON GO NORTH WITH US ASKED SYLVIA WHO HAD CONVINCED HERSELF THAT WHEN MISTER LINCOLN WAS IN CHARGE OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT ALL THE TROUBLES OVER CHARLESTON'S FORTS WOULD END BUT MISSUS FULTON SHOOK HER HEAD
BUT ESTRALLA LISTEN I COULD BE BLACK YOU COULD RUB SOOT FROM THE CHIMNEY ALL OVER MY FACE AND HANDS AND I COULD PIN MY HAIR CLOSE ON TOP OF MY HEAD
SAID LINK PUTTING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND LOOKING AT LUCIAN WITH AN ODD EXPRESSION YOU HAD BETTER WAIT TILL THE MAN'S CAUGHT BEFORE I ANSWER THAT QUESTION THEN MAYBE YOU WON'T REQUIRE AN ANSWER IT IS VERY PROBABLE I WON'T REPLIED LUCIAN DRILY WHAT TIME AM I TO SEE YOU TO NIGHT
WITHIN THE HOUR OF THEIR ARRIVAL SYLVIA AND ESTRALLA WERE ON THEIR WAY HOME THE CAPTAIN HAD PRAISED AND THANKED SYLVIA FOR THE LOYAL FRIENDSHIP THAT HAD PROMPTED HER VISIT MISSUS CARLETON AND I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER YOUR COURAGE HE SAID AS HE HANDED HER THE LETTER
THEN HE RECOVERED QUICKLY AND SMILED A BITTER SMILE NO I WAS NOT NEAR THE PLACE I CAN PROVE IT BESIDES YOUR FOLKS AND MYSELF WERE ON GOOD TERMS THERE IS SOMEBODY ELSE WHO WAS AROUND THE HOUSE WHEN THE AFFAIR HAPPENED SOMEBODY YOU KNOW WELL

SHE PANTED IF I ANSWER THAT QUESTION WILL YOU BECOME MY WIFE AGAIN SHE SHRANK BACK YOU KNOW THE MURDERER SHE REPEATED PERHAPS YOU COMMITTED THE FOUL DEEDS YOURSELF HE TOOK A STEP BACK AS IF STRUCK A BLOW
HE SAID THAT RALPH WAS IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY I'D BE A SOLDIER IF I WAS ONLY A LITTLE OLDER HE DECLARED AND SYLVIA DID NOT EVEN ASK HIM ABOUT DINKIE OR THE PONIES SHE WISHED THAT SHE COULD TELL HIM THAT VERY SOON SHE WAS GOING TO BOSTON BUT SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST NOT
SHE DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE LYDIA DEPRIVED OF HER MONEY AND PUT INTO JAIL THE PUNISHMENT WOULD BE NO MORE THAN SHE DESERVED YET WHEN THESE THINGS CAME TO PASS WHEN BY THE DISCOVERY THAT VRAIN YET LIVED LYDIA LOST HER LIBERTY AND WHEN
FINDING THAT MOLLY AND POLLY HAD NOT BEEN HURT BY THEIR FALL AND THAT NONE OF THE LITTLE DISHES WERE BROKEN YOU OUGHT TO TELL HER MOTHER TO WHIP HER SHE'S NO BUSINESS UP HERE SAID GRACE DON'T GRACE SYLVIA EXCLAIMED WE DON'T GET WHIPPED EVERY TIME WE MAKE A MISTAKE
CAPTAIN CARLETON SEEMED VERY GLAD TO WELCOME THEM AND SENT A SOLDIER TO ESCORT THE GIRLS TO THE OFFICERS QUARTERS WHILE MISTER FULTON WENT IN SEARCH OF MAJOR ANDERSON SYLVIA WONDERED IF SHE WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO TELL MISSUS CARLETON THAT SHE HAD SAFELY DELIVERED THE MESSAGE
WHILE SYLVIA PICKED UP HER TREASURED DOLLS MOLLY AND POLLY WHICH HER GRANDMOTHER FULTON HAD SENT HER ON HER LAST BIRTHDAY I WUZ UP HERE JEST A SITTIN AN A LOOKIN AT EM MISSY WAILED ESTRALLA I NEVER LAYED HAND ON EM
AND MISTER WAITE SMILED AND BOWED AND SEEMED EXACTLY LIKE SANTA CLAUS I'M EVER SO MUCH OBLIGED SAID SYLVIA I LIKE ESTRALLA DO YOU YES WELL AND I HOPE YOU WILL COME AGAIN MISS SYLVIA
WHOSE RED FACE AND WHITE WHISKERS MADE HER THINK OF THE PICTURES OF SANTA CLAUS WON'T YOU BE SEATED YOUNG LADY HE SAID VERY POLITELY WAVING HIS HAND TOWARD A LOW CUSHIONED CHAIR AND BOWING AS IF I WERE REALLY GROWN UP THOUGHT SYLVIA
AND I AM DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU TAKE HER OFF MY HANDS
GRACE WAS SO SERIOUS THAT SYLVIA WONDERED WHAT IT COULD BE
AND THEN LED THE WAY ACROSS THE WIDE HALL AND RAPPED AT A DOOR A LITTLE WHITE MISSY TO SEE YOU MASSA ROBERT HE SAID AND IN A MOMENT SYLVIA FOUND HERSELF STANDING BEFORE A SMILING GENTLEMAN
IT'S BECAUSE SHE IS ILL AND SHE'S DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T SEE LADY CAROLINE SYLVIA WHISPERED IN A MOMENT FLORA LOOKED UP WITH A LITTLE SMILE I AM SO SILLY SHE SAID YOU MUST FORGIVE ME
GRACE HAD TRIED BEST TO CONVINCE SYLVIA THAT SHE HAD REALLY DREAMED LADY CAROLINE BUT SYLVIA INSISTED THAT A FIGURE IN A WIDE PLUMED HAT AND A TRAILING GOWN HAD REALLY STEPPED OUT OF THE CLOSET
DECLARING THAT HE WAS JUST LIKE SANTA CLAUS SHE DID NOT REPROVE HER FOR GOING ON SUCH AN ERRAND WITHOUT PERMISSION BUT AGREED WITH HER LITTLE DAUGHTER THAT MISTER ROBERT WAITE WAS A VERY KIND AND GENEROUS GENTLEMAN
IT'S MIGHTY HARD TO GO OFF AND LEAVE MY MAMMY AN NEVER SEE YOU ALL NO MORE MISSY SYLVIA
SHE WAS AS SURE THAT ALL WOULD BE WELL NOW AS SHE HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED AND DESPONDENT WHEN SHE ENTERED THE ROOM SHALL I TELL MY MAMMY SHE ASKED EAGERLY YES SYLVIA RESPONDED I KNOW MY MOTHER WILL LET ME
WHO WAS CARRYING SYLVIA'S CAPE AND TRYING TO ACT AS MUCH LIKE A RALE GROWN UP LADY'S MAID AS POSSIBLE CAME DOWN TO THE LONG WHARF ALTHOUGH IT WAS DECEMBER THERE WAS LITTLE TO REMIND ANYONE OF WINTER THE AIR WAS SOFT AND CLEAR
MY MAMMY WAS OVER TO MASSA WAITE'S HOUSE LAS NIGHT AND
ESTRALLA HAD HIDDEN HERSELF BEHIND SOME SHRUBBERY AND JOINED SYLVIA AT THE GATE WOULD HE HIRE ME OUT MISSY SHE ASKED EAGERLY MY NO ANSWERED SYLVIA AND BEFORE SHE COULD EXPLAIN THE GENEROSITY OF ESTRALLA'S OWNER
WHERE IS SYLVIA ASKED MISTER FULTON LOOKING AT HIS WATCH WE REALLY OUGHT TO HAVE STARTED AN HOUR AGO FOR A MOMENT THE LITTLE GROUP LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN SILENCE THEN WITH A SUDDEN CRY ESTRALLA DARTED OFF
OH ESTRALLA ISN'T STUPID NOT A BIT REPLIED SYLVIA LAUGHINGLY ESTRALLA WHO WAS CAREFULLY PUTTING THE LITTLE TABLE IN ORDER
AND SHE WOULD SOON BE IN SIGHT OF SOME FAMILIAR PLACE
PERHAPS SHE HAS MISTER FULTON SAID FOR US TO COME RIGHT TO THE LANDING SAID GRACE HER THOUGHTS STILL FULL OF THE FAITHFUL SANCHO PANZA OF WHOM SHE HAD BEEN READING I WILL GO TO THE WHARF WITH YOU IT WAS TOO BAD TO LEAVE YOU
I DON'T THINK IT WAS FAIR SHE SAID SLOWLY OF COURSE IT WASN'T FAIR I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED THAT A CHARLESTON GIRL WOULD DO SUCH A MEAN TRICK DECLARED GRACE OF COURSE AS WE WERE HER COMPANY WE CAN'T LET HER KNOW THAT WE HAVE FOUND HER OUT
BUT HER FATHER WAS JUST LEAVING THE DINING ROOM WHEN SHE CAME IN ARE YOU GOING TO ASK YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS TO GO OUT IN THE BUTTERFLY THIS AFTERNOON HE ASKED
AND SYLVIA WAS OUT OF BED IN A SECOND STANDING CLOSE BESIDE THE LITTLE COLORED GIRL I DUNNO MISSY SYLVIA I SPEC DAR AIN'T NUFFIN YOU KIN DO BUT YOU HAS BEEN MIGHTY GOOD TO ME ESTRALLA REPLIED
BECAUSE GRANDMA SAID I COULD DO AS I PLEASED WITH THE MONEY AND I PLEASE TO PAY IT TO MISTER WAITE
CRAWLED UNDER THE SCRAGGLY BRANCHES OF SOME STUNTED TREES ON A SHELTERED SLOPE MY FATHER WILL COME AND FIND ME I KNOW HE WILL SHE SAID ALOUD ALMOST READY TO CRY I'LL WAIT HERE AND KEEP CALLING ESTRALLA SO HE WILL HEAR ME
IT WAS A VERY SOBER LITTLE DARKY WHO CAME UP TO SYLVIA'S ROOM THE NEXT MORNING SHE SET DOWN THE PITCHER OF WATER AND MOVED SILENTLY TOWARD THE DOOR WHAT'S THE MATTER ESTRALLA SYLVIA CALLED
I KNOW ONE THING SYLVIA YOU WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING MEAN IF YOU ARE A YANKEE GRACE DECLARED WARMLY WHAT'S THAT NOISE SHE ADDED QUICKLY THE ROOM WAS SHADOWY IN THE GATHERING TWILIGHT AND THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS HAD BEEN SITTING NEAR THE WINDOW
NO RESPONSE CAME TO HER CALLS SO SHE WENT DOWN THE STEPS AND ALONG THE WALK WHICH LED TO THE SAND BARS PAST THE HOUSES AND BARRACKS ON SULLIVAN'S ISLAND NO ONE WAS IN SIGHT WHOM SHE COULD ASK IF ESTRALLA HAD PASSED THAT WAY
AND HE HURRIED AWAY THINKING HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS SAFE WITH MISSUS CARLETON
SYLVIA I'M COMING OVER TO NIGHT I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU GRACE SAID AS THE TWO FRIENDS STOOD FOR A MOMENT AT SYLVIA'S GATE AFTER THEY HAD THANKED UNCLE CHRIS AND SAID GOOD BYE TO SYLVIA'S BROTHERS
AND A THOROUGH SEARCH FOR THE LITTLE GIRL WAS BEGUN AT ONCE NO ONE GAVE A THOUGHT TO ESTRALLA
AND THE TWO GIRLS TURNED DOWN THE STREET LEADING TO THE HOUSE OF ESTRALLA'S MASTER SYLVIA WENT UP THE FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS WHICH LED TO MISTER WAITE'S DOOR A LITTLE FEARFULLY A TALL GOOD NATURED COLORED MAN OPENED THE DOOR AND ASKED HER ERRAND
MISSUS CARLETON WAS IN HER PLEASANT SITTING ROOM AND DECLARED THAT SHE HAD BEEN WISHING FOR COMPANY AND HELD UP SOME STRIPS OF RED AND WHITE BUNTING I AM MAKING A NEW FLAG FOR FORT SUMTER SHE SAID PERHAPS YOU WILL HELP ME SEW ON THE STARS ONE FOR EACH STATE YOU KNOW
QUESTIONED ESTRALLA EARNESTLY I THINK I WILL TAKE THE MONEY SYLVIA SAID NOT ANSWERING ESTRALLA'S QUESTION THEN MISTER WAITE WILL BE SURE THAT I CAN PAY HIM
BEFORE SYLVIA COULD SPEAK SHE HEARD THE LITTLE WAILING CRY WHICH ESTRALLA ALWAYS GAVE WHEN IN TROUBLE AND THEN DON'T BE SKEERED MISSY
OH IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT
ESTRALLA IF YOU WERE EARNING WAGES FOR MISTER ROBERT WAITE WOULD HE LET YOU STAY HERE SYLVIA ASKED EAGERLY
PERHAPS FLORA WILL OWN UP GRACE SAID AS THE TWO GIRLS FOLLOWED MISSUS FULTON DOWN THE STAIRS ANYWAY YOU ARE MIGHTY FAIR ABOUT IT AND YOU'RE GOOD TO THAT STUPID LITTLE DARKY
IT WAS RATHER DIFFICULT WALKING HER FEET SLIPPED IN THE SAND AND AFTER A LITTLE SYLVIA DECIDED NOT TO FOLLOW THE SHORE BUT TO CLIMB BACK OVER THE SAND HILLS A COLD WIND WAS NOW BLOWING FROM THE WATER
FLORA DRESSED UP IN HER MOTHER'S THINGS AND THEN CAME UP THE STAIRS TO OUR ROOM SHE WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE US THINK SHE HAD A TRULY GHOST IN HER HOUSE THEN WHEN YOU CALLED OUT SHE GOT FRIGHTENED AND STUMBLED ON THE STAIRS
RODE DOWN THE DRIVEWAY JUST AS GRACE AND SYLVIA REACHED THE ENTRANCE HE GREETED THEM SMILINGLY AND STOPPED HIS HORSE TO SPEAK WITH THEM IT WAS ALL PLANNED FOR US TO GO TO THE PLANTATION BEFORE FLORA GOT HOME LAST NIGHT HE EXPLAINED FATHER THOUGHT IT WAS BEST FOR THE FAMILY TO BE OUT OF THE CITY
BUT ALL COMMUNICATION WITH NORTHERN STATES MIGHT BE PREVENTED IT WAS NO WONDER THAT MISTER AND MISSUS FULTON WERE ANXIOUS AND WORRIED
SYLVIA HURRIED HOME EAGER TO TELL HER MOTHER OF HER WONDERFUL NEW FRIEND AND OF FLORA'S DEPARTURE TO THE PLANTATION MISSUS FULTON LISTENED IN SURPRISE BUT WHEN SYLVIA FINISHED HER STORY OF MISTER WAITE'S KINDNESS
IS THERE ONE FOR SOUTH CAROLINA ASKED GRACE AS MISSUS CARLETON FOUND TWO SMALL THIMBLES WHICH SHE SAID SHE HAD USED WHEN SHE WAS NO OLDER THAN SYLVIA AND SHOWED THE GIRLS HOW TO SEW THE WHITE STARS SECURELY ON THE BLUE
YES SIR SAID SYLVIA MEEKLY WONDERING WHETHER SHE WOULD EVER DARE TELL HIM HER ERRAND THERE WAS A LITTLE SILENCE AND THEN MISTER WAITE TOOK A SEAT NEAR HIS LITTLE VISITOR AND SAID LET ME SEE
ALMOST FORGETTING HER SEARCH FOR ESTRALLA AND FINALLY DECIDING THAT IT WAS TIME TO GO BACK TO MISSUS CARLETON PROBABLY ESTRALLA IS THERE BEFORE THIS AND THEY WILL BE LOOKING FOR ME SHE THOUGHT AND CLIMBED ANOTHER SANDY SLOPE EXPECTING TO SEE THE HOUSES AND BARRACKS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER
WAIT ESTRALLA WHAT DO YOU MEAN EXCLAIMED SYLVIA SITTING UP IN BED
CHAPTER FIFTEEN WHERE IS SYLVIA THE BUTTERFLY WAS ALL READY AND WAITING FOR ITS PASSENGERS WHEN GRACE AND SYLVIA FOLLOWED BY THE SMILING AND DELIGHTED ESTRALLA
WELL PUT ON YOUR THINGS AND RUN AFTER THEM THAT'S A GOOD GIRL SAID MISTER FULTON WHY HERE IS ESTRALLA NOW HE ADDED AS THE LITTLE COLORED GIRL APPEARED AT THE DOOR TELL MISS SYLVIA TO COME DOWN TO THE LANDING I'LL MEET YOU THERE
I SPEC NOW I'LL GET WHIPPED
THE ADVENTURES OF DON QUIXOTE WAS THE TITLE OF THE BOOK AND AFTER GRACE BEGAN TO READ SHE ENTIRELY FORGOT SYLVIA ESTRALLA AND MISSUS CARLETON AND NOT UNTIL MISTER FULTON CAME INTO THE ROOM AN HOUR LATER DID SHE LIFT HER EYES FROM THE BOOK
AUNT CONNIE WAS AS DELIGHTED AS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR A MOTHER TO BE WHO KNOWS THAT HER YOUNGEST CHILD IS SAFE UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH HERSELF SHE TRIED TO THANK SYLVIA FOR PROTECTING ESTRALLA BUT SYLVIA WAS TOO HAPPY OVER HER SUCCESS TO LISTEN TO HER
A TWILIGHT TEA PARTY IT WAS LATE WHEN GRACE AND SYLVIA AWOKE THE FOLLOWING MORNING BUT THEY WERE DOWN STAIRS BEFORE THE BOYS APPEARED MISSUS HAYES GREETED THEM SMILINGLY
GRACE WAS READY TO START FOR SCHOOL WHEN SYLVIA AND ESTRALLA ARRIVED AND HER MOTHER GAVE HER CONSENT AT ONCE FOR HER TO GO SAILING IN THE AFTERNOON THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS WILL SOON BE HERE SO A HALF DAY OUT OF SCHOOL WILL NOT MATTER MISSUS WAITE SAID SMILINGLY
AND A LONG BLUE SKIRT ONE OF HER MOTHER'S THEY WEREN'T THERE YESTERDAY FOR THE DOOR WAS OPEN JUST AS IT WAS TO DAY WELL WHAT OF THAT ASKED SYLVIA OH SYLVIA CAN'T YOU SEE GRACE ASKED IMPATIENTLY
AND THERE IS PHILIP ON HORSEBACK THE CARRIAGE HAD TURNED ON TO THE STREET AND EVEN AS GRACE SPOKE A CURVE IN THE ROAD HID IT FROM VIEW PHILIP EVIDENTLY GIVING SOME DIRECTIONS TO THE NEGROES WHO WERE LOADING TRUNKS AND BOXES INTO A CART
IS NOT YOUR NAME IN A SONG THEN TO SYLVIA LET US SING HE HUMMED BEATING TIME WITH HIS RIGHT HAND OH YES I WAS NAMED FOR THAT SONG AND IF YOU PLEASE MISTER WAITE
I MUST SEE SYLVIA BEFORE SHE GOES PERHAPS I MAY NOT BE PERMITTED TO HAVE VISITORS MUCH LONGER SAID MISSUS CARLETON AND SHE AND GRACE LEFT THE PLEASANT ROOM AND FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY ESTRALLA MADE THEIR WAY OVER THE BRIDGE TO THE LANDING PLACE
BUT SHE SAID THAT FLORA WAS NOT WELL AND THAT MAMMY WOULD TAKE HER BREAKFAST TO HER UP STAIRS AFTER BREAKFAST YOU MUST GO UP AND STAY WITH HER A LITTLE WHILE SAID MISSUS HAYES WHY FLORA WAS NEVER ILL IN HER LIFE DECLARED RALPH WHAT'S THE MATTER
FOR USUALLY ESTRALLA WAS ALL SMILES AND HAD A GOOD DEAL TO SAY ESTRALLA SHOOK HER HEAD NUFFIN MISSY I KNOWED YOU COULDN'T DO NUFFIN BOUT IT MY MAMMY SAYS HOW NOBODY CAN
I'LL HAVE TO RUN OR I'LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL DECLARED GRACE I'LL BE ALL READY WHEN YOU CALL AND WITH A GAY GOOD BYE SHE WAS OFF DOWN THE STREET LEAVING SYLVIA AND ESTRALLA STANDING ALONE NEAR THE HIGH WALL WHICH ENCLOSED THE GARDEN OF THE HAYES HOUSE MASSA ROBERT WAITE
BUT I DIDN'T AND GRACE LAUGHED GOOD NATUREDLY BUT FLORA TURNED HER FACE FROM THEM AND BEGAN TO CRY AFTER MY BEING HURT AND SHE SOBBED BUT STOPPED QUICKLY SYLVIA AND GRACE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN AMAZEMENT
PERHAPS SHE MEANT TO TELL US ANYWAY SUGGESTED SYLVIA HOPEFULLY I'M SURE SHE DID SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE US LAUGH WELL THEN WHY DIDN'T SHE ASKED GRACE SYLVIA'S FACE CLOUDED SHE COULD NOT ANSWER THIS QUESTION
OH ESTRALLA YOU HAVEN'T BROKEN MY DOLLS WHAT WERE YOU UP HERE FOR ANYWAY AND SYLVIA QUITE FORGOT ALL HER PLANS TO RESCUE ESTRALLA AS SHE RAN TOWARD HER THE DOLL LADIES AS THE LITTLE DARKY GIRL HAD ALWAYS CALLED SYLVIA'S TWO CHINA DOLLS
NO I'LL TELL YOU AFTER SUPPER GRACE RESPONDED AND RAN ON TO HER OWN HOME
GRACE WATCHED HER ADMIRINGLY I BELIEVE YOU COULD STEER IN THE DARK SHE DECLARED OF COURSE SHE COULD IF SHE HAD A COMPASS AND WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE STARS SAID MISTER FULTON
BUT I COULD GO SLEIGHING RESPONDED SYLVIA AS THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF FLORA'S HOME THEY BOTH EXCLAIMED IN SURPRISE WHY THEY ARE ALL GOING AWAY
SYLVIA AND GRACE WERE BEING ENTERTAINED AT TEA BY MISSES MOLLY AND POLLY WHILE ESTRALLA WITH SHINING EYES AND A WIDE SMILE CARRIED TINY CUPS AND LITTLE CAKES TO THE GUESTS AND CHUCKLED DELIGHTEDLY OVER THE CLEVER THINGS WHICH
I AM GREATLY PLEASED TO HAVE MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE AND THE POLITE GENTLEMAN ESCORTED HER TO THE DOOR WHERE HE BADE HER GOOD BYE WITH SUCH AN ELEGANT BOW THAT SYLVIA NEARLY FELL BACKWARD IN HER EFFORT TO MAKE AS LOW A CURTSEY AS SEEMED NECESSARY
SYLVIA AND GRACE DECLARED MOLLY AND POLLY HAD SAID
MISSUS FULTON SAW SYLVIA CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY ESTRALLA RUNNING ACROSS THE GARDEN TOWARD THE HOUSE WHERE GRACE WAITE LIVED POOR LITTLE DARKY WHAT WILL SHE DO WHEN SYLVIA GOES NORTH SHE THOUGHT
SYLVIA AND GRACE SPREAD THE LITTLE TABLE BROUGHT CUSHIONS FROM THE WINDOW SEATS AND ADVISED MOLLY AND POLLY TO FORGIVE THE DISTURBANCE WHEN MISSUS FULTON CAME UP STAIRS A LITTLE LATER TO TELL GRACE THAT HER BLACK MAMMY HAD COME TO TAKE HER HOME SHE FOUND THREE VERY HAPPY LITTLE GIRLS
THEY HAD JUST FINISHED SUPPER WHEN GRACE APPEARED AND THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS WENT UP TO SYLVIA'S ROOM
OH YES AGREED MISTER FULTON BUT WE HAD BEST LOSE NO TIME IN FINDING HER WHILE CAPTAIN CARLETON QUESTIONED THE SOLDIERS MISTER FULTON AND MISSUS CARLETON AND GRACE HASTENED BACK TO THE OFFICERS QUARTERS
A FEW MOMENTS AFTER SYLVIA STARTED TO FIND ESTRALLA MISSUS CARLETON HAD BEEN CALLED TO A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE TELL SYLVIA I WON'T BE GONE LONG SHE HAD SAID TO GRACE GRACE DID NOT MIND BEING ALONE UNTIL SYLVIA RETURNED
MISTER FULTON CAME TO MEET THEM AND HELPED THEM ON BOARD THE BOAT AS THE BUTTERFLY MADE ITS WAY OUT INTO THE CHANNEL THE LITTLE GIRLS LOOKED BACK AT THE LONG WATER FRONT WHERE LAY MANY VESSELS FROM FAR OFF PORTS IN THE DISTANCE THEY COULD SEE THE SPIRE OF SAINT PHILIP'S
AN I'LL ALLERS GO WHAR YO GOES LIKE MISSY FLORA HAYES MAMMY DOES WHY YES I SUPPOSE YOU WILL AGREED SYLVIA SYLVIA HAD MEANT TO TELL HER MOTHER AND FATHER OF HER PLAN ABOUT ESTRALLA AT BREAKFAST TIME
I'SE MIGHTY GLAD HE GIVES ME TO YOU MISSY I RECKON MY MAMMY'S GWINE TO BE GLAD AND ESTRALLA QUITE FORGETTING THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS TROUBLE IN THE WORLD DANCED ALONG BESIDE HER NEW MISTRESS
FEELING ALMOST SURE THAT LIKE HERSELF ESTRALLA MUST BE WANDERING ABOUT LOST IN THE SAND HILLS IT WAS NEARLY DARK BEFORE SHE GAVE UP TRYING TO FIND HER WAY TO THE FORT AND SHIVERING AND HALF AFRAID
BUT THAT PHILIP SHOULD WANT THE PALMETTO FLAG TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE STARS AND STRIPES OVER FORT SUMTER SEEMED A MUCH GREATER MISFORTUNE WHEN HE KNOWS IT STANDS FOR SLAVERY SHE THOUGHT WONDERING IF HE HAD ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN ABOUT DINKIE
TWENTY DOLLARS WAS A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY SHE REFLECTED IF THE NORTHERN SOLDIERS WOULD ONLY COME QUICKLY AND SET THE SLAVES FREE BUT EVEN IF THEY DID NOT COME FOR A LONG TIME THE MONEY WOULD SURELY PAY MISTER WAITE WAGES FOR ESTRALLA SO THAT HE WOULD NOT INSIST ON SELLING HER
AND HAD SEEN CERTAIN THINGS WHICH MADE HER QUITE READY TO OWN THAT FLORA MIGHT BE RIGHT BUT SHE WAS RATHER SERIOUS AND SILENT FOR THE REST OF THE VISIT BEFORE THEY LEFT FLORA'S ROOM FLORA ASKED SYLVIA NOT TO TELL ANYONE THAT SHE HAD SEEN A GHOST
AND ESTRALLA HASN'T ANYTHING OF HER OWN JUST THINK YOUR UNCLE ROBERT CAN SELL HER AWAY FROM HER OWN MOTHER
GRACE LOOKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND THEN CLOSED THE DOOR NOT SEEING A LITTLE FIGURE CROUCHING IN A SHADOWY CORNER I WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE TO HEAR IT'S ABOUT THE GHOST SHE WHISPERED I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
YES AND IF SYLVIA UNDERSTOOD HOW TO STEER BY THE COMPASS SHE COULD STEER THE BUTTERFLY AS WELL AT NIGHT AS SHE CAN NOW SYLVIA LOOKED AT THE COMPASS WITH A NEW INTEREST SHE WAS SURE THAT NAVIGATION WOULD BE A MUCH MORE INTERESTING STUDY THAN GRAMMAR
WHICH SAT IN TWO SMALL CHAIRS IN FRONT OF A DOLL'S TABLE IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM WERE BOTH SPRAWLING ON THE FLOOR THEIR CHAIRS UPSET AND THE LITTLE TABLE WITH ITS TINY TEA SET OVERTURNED GRACE LIT THE CANDLES ON SYLVIA'S BUREAU
AND HE CALLED GRACE'S ATTENTION TO THE COMPASS FASTENED SECURELY NEAR SYLVIA'S SEAT AND EXPLAINED THE RULES OF NAVIGATION IS THAT THE WAY THE BIG SHIPS KNOW HOW TO FIND THEIR HARBORS ASKED GRACE WHEN MISTER FULTON TOLD HER OF THE STARS AND HOW THE PILOTS SET THEIR COURSE
NO SHE SAID YOU SHALL NOT BE SOLD NOW DON'T LOOK SO FRIGHTENED WE WILL HAVE A TEA PARTY FOR MOLLY AND POLLY AND YOU SHALL WAIT ON THEM RUN DOWN AND ASK YOUR MOTHER TO GIVE US SOME LITTLE CAKES ESTRALLA WAS OFF IN AN INSTANT AND WHILE SHE WAS AWAY
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU PLEASE WITH IT WAS WHAT GRANDMOTHER FULTON HAD SAID SYLVIA HAD THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD ASK HER MOTHER TO BUY HER A WATCH WITH THE MONEY BUT SHE DID NOT REMEMBER THAT NOW SHE KNEW THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING SHE WOULD RATHER KEEP ESTRALLA SAFE
FOR MISTER FULTON HAD TOLD HER THAT VERY MORNING THAT HE WAS SURE SOUTH CAROLINA WOULD SECEDE FROM THE UNION AND THEN NORTHERN MEN WOULD NO LONGER BE WELCOME IN CHARLESTON THAT MEANT OF COURSE THAT THE FULTONS WOULD HAVE TO RETURN TO BOSTON IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE
AND NOW FOUND HERSELF NEAR THE LANDING PLACE SO THAT WHEN MISSUS CARLETON MADE THE GIRLS A CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE AND LOOKED ABOUT TO GIVE ESTRALLA HER SHARE THE LITTLE COLORED GIRL WAS NOT TO BE SEEN I'LL CALL HER SAID SYLVIA AND RAN OUT ON THE VERANDA
SEE QUITE RIGHT BUT IF SHE IS LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE SHE IS NOT COSTING ME A PENNY FOR BOARD SO I AM INDEBTED TO YOU WELL WELL I MUST SEE THAT WHATEVER YOU WISH IS CARRIED OUT
IF YOU PLEASE SIR SHE IS AUNT CONNIE'S LITTLE GIRL AND SHE LIVES WITH US AND I LIKE HER AND I THOUGHT BEGAN SYLVIA BUT MISTER WAITE RAISED HIS HAND AND SHE STOPPED SUDDENLY
HE WAS JUST AS KIND AND POLITE AS IF I HAD BEEN A GROWN UP YOUNG LADY SAID SYLVIA WITH ENTHUSIASM YAS'M I RECKONS HE WOULD HAFTER BE
AFTER BREAKFAST MAMMY CAME TO TELL THE VISITORS THAT FLORA WAS READY TO SEE THEM BUT JUS FOR A LITTLE WHILE SHE ADDED AS SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF FLORA'S CHAMBER
THE SUN SHONE BRIGHTLY AND ONLY A LITTLE WESTERLY BREEZE RUFFLED THE BLUE WATERS OF THE HARBOR NEGROES WERE AT WORK ON THE WHARF LOADING BALES OF COTTON ON A BIG SHIP THEY WERE SINGING AS THEY WORKED
BUT SHE FOUND HERSELF FACING THE OPEN SEA
THE DECEMBER DAY DREW TO A CLOSE AND DUSKY SHADOWS CREPT OVER THE ISLAND ONCE OR TWICE SYLVIA'S WANDERINGS HAD BROUGHT HER BACK TO THE SHORE BUT NOT UNTIL THE DARKNESS BEGAN TO GATHER DID SHE REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS LOST
YOU SEE THE BOYS WOULD LAUGH AND NO ONE BUT ME REALLY BELIEVES THE HOUSE IS HAUNTED SHE EXPLAINED OF COURSE SYLVIA PROMISED BUT SHE WAS PUZZLED BY FLORA'S REQUEST
AND THERE MAY BE TROUBLE BUT THE PALMETTO FLAG WILL SOON FLOAT OVER FORT SUMTER HE ADDED SMILINGLY AND WITH A TOUCH OF HIS CAP AND A SMILING GOOD BYE HE RODE OFF SYLVIA WAS SORRY THAT FLORA WAS GOING AWAY
AND I'LL KEEP ON TO MISTER ROBERT WAITE'S AND HAVE IT ALL SETTLED THIS MORNING SYLVIA REPLIED PUTTING ON HER PRETTY NEW HAT YOU MAY COME TOO SHE ADDED
SHE CLIMBED A SMALL SAND HILL COVERED WITH STUNTED LITTLE TREES AND LOOKED ABOUT BUT COULD SEE NO TRACE OF THE LITTLE DARKY IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO SYLVIA THAT ESTRALLA WOULD GO BACK TO THE FORT
SYLVIA DID NOT DREAM IT I KNOW SHE SAW IT SHE DECLARED
ESTRALLA'S FACE HAD BRIGHTENED INSTANTLY AT SYLVIA'S PROMISE AND WHEN SYLVIA EXPLAINED THAT SHE HAD MONEY OF HER VERY OWN AND EVEN OPENED HER WRITING DESK AND SHOWED ESTRALLA THE SHINING GOLD PIECES THE LITTLE DARKY'S FEARS VANISHED
IN A SUNNY CORNER OF THE VERANDA FOR THE LAST HOUR WHERE IS SYLVIA ECHOED MISSUS CARLETON WHO CAME IN AT THAT MOMENT HAS SHE GONE TO THE BOAT
AND GAVE GRACE A NOTE FOR MISS PATTEN I'LL WALK TO FLORA'S WITH YOU SAID GRACE NOW SYLVIA OWN UP THAT YOU THINK CHARLESTON IS NICER THAN BOSTON
FLORA WAS BOLSTERED UP IN BED AND HAD ON A DAINTY DRESSING GOWN OF PINK MUSLIN TIED WITH WHITE RIBBONS BUT THERE WAS A BANDAGE ABOUT HER RIGHT WRIST AND A SOFT STRIP OF COTTON WAS BOUND ABOUT HER HEAD
BUT SHE WAS SURE THAT FLORA HAD NOT MEANT TO FRIGHTEN OR REALLY DECEIVE THEM AND SHE WANTED TO DEFEND HER ABSENT FRIEND WELL GRACE WE KNOW FLORA WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING MEAN AND YOU SEE SHE GOT HURT
SHE HELPED HERSELF TO THE RICH CREAMY CHOCOLATE AND THE LITTLE FROSTED CAKES AND THEN CURLED UP ON A BROAD COUCH NEAR THE WINDOW WITH A BOOK FULL OF WONDERFUL PICTURES THE PICTURES WERE OF A TALL MAN ON HORSEBACK AND A SHORT FAT MAN ON A DONKEY
SYLVIA ATE HER BREAKFAST HURRIEDLY AND RAN UPSTAIRS FOR HER CAPE AND HAT
ESTRALLA ESTRALLA AND SURE THAT IF SHE WAS WITHIN HEARING ESTRALLA WOULD INSTANTLY APPEAR AS SYLVIA CLIMBED OVER THE SANDY SLOPE SHE SAW HERE AND THERE A SMALL GREEN VINE WITH GLOSSY LEAVES AND A TINY YELLOW BLOSSOM
THEN I GUESS GRACE WILL BELIEVE THIS IS A HAUNTED HOUSE SAID FLORA A LITTLE TRIUMPHANTLY I DIDN'T SEE IT SAID GRACE AND TRULY I BELIEVE SYLVIA JUST DREAMED IT FLORA SAT UP IN BED SUDDENLY
ONE OF THE HISTORIC CHURCHES OF CHARLESTON AND EVERYWHERE FLUTTERED THE PALMETTO FLAG SYLVIA SAT IN THE STERN BESIDE HER FATHER AND VERY SOON THE TILLER WAS IN HER HAND AND SHE WAS SHAPING THE BOAT'S COURSE TOWARD THE FORTS
IT WAS DECIDED THAT RALPH AND PHILIP SHOULD RIDE BACK TO CHARLESTON THAT AFTERNOON WHEN UNCLE CHRIS DROVE THE LITTLE VISITORS HOME AND THAT FLORA SHOULD STAY AT THE PLANTATION WITH HER MOTHER FOR A DAY OR TWO SYLVIA HAD ENJOYED HER VISIT
I'LL ASK THEM RIGHT AWAY AFTER BREAKFAST BEFORE THEY START FOR SCHOOL SYLVIA PROMISED EAGERLY
THERE HAD BEEN MANY CHANGES AT FORT MOULTRIE SINCE SYLVIA'S LAST VISIT A DEEP DITCH HAD BEEN DUG BETWEEN THE FORT AND THE SAND BARS AND MANY WORKMEN WERE BUSY IN STRENGTHENING THE DEFENCES AND SYLVIA AND GRACE WONDERED WHY SO MANY SOLDIERS WERE STATIONED ALONG THE PARAPET
MISSY I'SE A GWINE TO RUN OFF AN HIDE MYSELF TIL THE YANKEE SOLDIERS COMES AND SETS US FREE SAID ESTRALLA YOU CAN'T DO THAT BUT DON'T BE FRIGHTENED ESTRALLA I HAVE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING I WILL HIRE YOU YES I WILL
SO THAT SHE FEELS LAME AND TIRED AND I THOUGHT A FEW HOURS IN BED WOULD BE THE BEST THING FOR HER EXPLAINED MISSUS HAYES MAMMY DOESN'T SEEM TO KNOW JUST HOW IT HAPPENED SHE CONCLUDED
MISSUS CARLETON HURRIEDLY EXPLAINED SYLVIA'S STARTING OFF TO FIND ESTRALLA AND HER OWN DEPARTURE SHE BLAMED HERSELF THAT SHE HAD PERMITTED SYLVIA TO GO OUT ALONE SHE MUST BE SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE FORT DECLARED CAPTAIN CARLETON
ALL READY TO START SAID MISTER FULTON AND IT WILL BE DUSK BEFORE WE REACH HOME WHERE IS SYLVIA OH EXCLAIMED GRACE LOOKING UP IN SURPRISE HASN'T SHE COME BACK WITH ESTRALLA MISSUS CARLETON HAS JUST GONE TO THE NEXT HOUSE
YOU KNOW WE HEARD SOMEONE FALL AND CRY OUT OF COURSE IT WAS FLORA NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW HOW SHE GOT HURT
AND SHE WAS GLAD OF THE SHELTER OF THE STUNTED TREES AND DECIDED TO REST FOR A LITTLE WHILE OF COURSE I CAN'T BE LOST BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I AM THIS IS SULLIVAN ISLAND AND THE FORT IS RIGHT OVER THERE I MUSTN'T REST BUT A MINUTE FOR MY FATHER SAID WE WOULD START HOME EARLY SHE THOUGHT
AND HERE IT IS WARM AND PLEASANT YOU COULDN'T GO SAILING IF YOU WERE IN BOSTON TO DAY SHE ADDED LAUGHINGLY
ESPECIALLY AS HER MOTHER HAD DECIDED THAT LESSONS WOULD NOT BEGIN UNTIL THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT HAD SEEMED TO MISSUS FULTON THAT HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS TIRED AND NOT AS WELL AS USUAL AND SHE WAS GLAD THAT THE SAILING EXPEDITION WOULD TAKE HER OUT FOR A LONG AFTERNOON ON THE WATER
THE LITTLE DARKY WAS WAILING AND SOBBING I KNOWED I'D BE SOLD I KNOWED IT KEEP STILL ESTRALLA MISTER WAITE SAYS I MAY HAVE YOU WITHOUT PAYING HIM JUST AS LONG AS I LIVE IN HIS HOUSE HE SAID YOU WERE TO BE MY MAID OH ESTRALLA
WE'VE BOUGHT A COTTAGE IN THE BRONX WITH THE MONEY SAID HE ANY EVENING AT SEVEN THEN SAID I WHEN YOU LED US AGAINST THE LUMBERMAN THE KLONDIKER IT WASN'T ALTOGETHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE
BUT THE CHIEF THING AT CYPHER'S WAS MILLY MILLY WAS A WAITRESS SHE WAS A GRAND EXAMPLE OF KRAFT'S THEORY OF THE ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE SHE BELONGED LARGELY TO WAITING AS MINERVA DID TO THE ART OF SCRAPPING OR VENUS TO THE SCIENCE OF SERIOUS FLIRTATION
THE BEST EXAMPLES OF THIS TREATMENT ARE FOUND IN FRANCE THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS THUS DECORATED WERE USUALLY OF PANELLED WOOD EITHER IN NATURAL OAK OR WALNUT
STUFFING HIS POCKETS WITH HIS EMBALMED BIRDS AND INDIGESTIBLE NUGGETS THERE HE RUMBLED A ROUGHLY GOOD HUMOURED PROTEST THAT'S THE GIRL FOR MY MONEY HE DECLARED SHE CAN EAT OUT OF MY SKILLET THE REST OF HER LIFE WHY I NEVER SEE SUCH A FINE GIRL
DID NOT TAKE SHAPE UNTIL MUCH LATER FOR WHEN BOOKS MULTIPLIED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF PRINTING IT BECAME CUSTOMARY TO FIT UP FOR THEIR RECEPTION LITTLE ROOMS CALLED CABINETS IN THE FAMOUS CABINET OF CATHERINE DE MEDICI AT BLOIS
WILL SHOW HOW SELDOM THE DETACHED BOOKCASE WAS USED IN FRENCH LIBRARIES BUT FEW MODELS ARE TO BE FOUND AND THESE WERE PROBABLY DESIGNED FOR USE IN THE BOUDOIR OR STUDY
OR THE WORK OF ROGER PAYNE AND SANDERSON UNSURPASSED AS THEY ARE IN COLOR VALUE ORDINARY BINDINGS OF HALF MOROCCO OR VELLUM FORM AN EXPANSE OF WARM LUSTROUS COLOR SUCH BINDINGS ARE COMPARATIVELY INEXPENSIVE
OUR PATHS SEPARATED AND I SAW KRAFT NO MORE AND JUDKINS SELDOM BUT AS I SAID I SAW A PAINTING THE OTHER DAY THAT WAS SOLD FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THE TITLE WAS BOADICEA AND THE FIGURE SEEMED TO FILL ALL OUT OF DOORS BUT OF ALL THE PICTURE'S ADMIRERS WHO STOOD BEFORE IT
YOU'LL TAKE ANOTHER WHISKEY AND MILK NOW KRAFT PERSUADED WITH SATAN'S SMILE I THOUGHT YOU UP COUNTRY FELLOWS WERE BETTER SPORTS KRAFT SPENT HIS PUNY STORE OF COIN AT THE BAR
STILL SOMEWHAT SOBER BEGAN TO BABBLE AGAIN OF MILLY KRAFT WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR SUCH A POLITE BARBED INSULT RELATING TO PEOPLE WHO WERE MISERLY WITH THEIR FUNDS THAT THE MINER CRASHED DOWN HANDFUL AFTER HANDFUL OF SILVER AND NOTES CALLING FOR ALL THE FLUIDS IN THE WORLD TO DROWN THE IMPUTATION
TO PRODUCE ALSO A SMALL EDITION IN LARGE PAPER COPIES THESE LARGE PAPER BOOKS THOUGH AS YET FAR FROM PERFECT IN TYPE AND MAKE UP ARE SUPERIOR TO THE AVERAGE COMMERCIAL ARTICLE AND APART FROM THEIR ARTISTIC MERIT ARE IN THEMSELVES A GOOD INVESTMENT
THUS THE FAMILY DRAWING ROOM IS TOO OFTEN MADE UNINHABITABLE FROM SOME VAGUE FEELING THAT A DRAWING ROOM IS NOT WORTHY OF ITS NAME UNLESS TOO FINE TO SIT IN
RATHER THAN TO DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THEM THE RICHLY ADORNED ROOM IN WHICH BOOKS ARE BUT A MINOR INCIDENT IS IN FACT NO LIBRARY AT ALL THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE DECORATIONS OF A LIBRARY SHOULD NOT BE SPLENDID BUT IN THAT CASE THE BOOKS MUST BE SPLENDID TOO
AND SO HUNG THAT IT MAY BE READILY DRAWN BACK DURING THE DAY IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE WINDOW WHILE IN A CORNER NEAR THIS WINDOW MAY BE PLACED AN EASY CHAIR AND A SMALL SOLIDLY MADE TABLE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD A LAMP AND A BOOK OR TWO THESE ROOMS IN SOME RECENTLY BUILT TOWN HOUSES CONTAIN CHIMNEYS SET IN AN ANGLE OF THE WALL
BUT THAT IS NOT THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY THREE YEARS AGO KRAFT BILL JUDKINS A POET AND I TOOK OUR MEALS AT CYPHER'S ON EIGHTH AVENUE I SAY TOOK WHEN WE HAD MONEY CYPHER GOT IT OFF OF US AS HE EXPRESSED IT WE HAD NO CREDIT
WE EMBRACED HIM AS A SPECIMEN AND IN THREE MINUTES WE HAD ALL BUT DIED FOR ONE ANOTHER AS FRIENDS HE WAS RUGGED AND BEARDED AND WIND DRIED HE HAD JUST COME OFF THE TRAIL HE SAID AT ONE OF THE NORTH RIVER FERRIES I FANCIED I COULD SEE THE SNOW DUST OF CHILCOOT YET POWDERING HIS SHOULDERS
SPACE MAY OF COURSE BE GAINED BY MEANS OF A SERIES OF BOOKCASES PROJECTING INTO THE ROOM AND FORMING DEEP BAYS ALONG EACH OF THE WALLS BUT THIS ARRANGEMENT IS SELDOM NECESSARY SAVE IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY
AND A MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN I SIGHED DESPAIRINGLY FROM WISCONSIN GROANED JUDKINS WE AGREED THAT THE AWFUL FATE SEEMED TO MENACE HER FEW THINGS WERE LESS IMPROBABLE MILLY LIKE SOME VAST VIRGIN STRETCH OF PINE WOODS
THUS RAISING THE BOOKS ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE FURNITURE THE PREVALENT FASHION OF LOW BOOK SHELVES STARTING FROM THE FLOOR AND NOT EXTENDING MUCH HIGHER THAN THE DADO MOULDING HAS PROBABLY BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE OTHER RECENT FASHION OF LOW STUDDED ROOMS
I'M GOING BACK THERE AND ASK HER TO MARRY ME
PROTOTYPES OF THE MODERN ROLLER TOP AND THE CANE OR LEATHER SEATED WRITING CHAIR WITH ROUNDED BACK AND FIVE SLIM STRONG LEGS
WERE MADE SUMPTUOUS AS CHURCH JEWELRY BY THE ART OF PAINTER AND GOLDSMITH LONG AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PRINTING PRESS BOOKS EXCEPT IN THE HANDS OF THE SCHOLAR CONTINUED TO BE A KIND OF CURIOSITY LIKE OTHER OBJECTS OF ART
AND THUS LEARN THAT THE MODERN BOOK IS TOO OFTEN MERELY THE CHEAPEST POSSIBLE VEHICLE FOR PUTTING WORDS INTO PRINT THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT SOME IMPROVEMENT AND IT IS NOW NOT UNUSUAL FOR A PUBLISHER IN BRINGING OUT A BOOK AT THE ORDINARY RATES
AT LAST THE BOLLWORM HAD ATTACKED THE COTTON THE POISON IVY WAS REACHING OUT ITS TENDRILS TO ENTWINE THE SUMMER BOARDER THE MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN THINLY DISGUISED AS THE ALASKAN MINER WAS ABOUT TO ENGULF OUR MILLY AND UPSET NATURE'S ADJUSTMENT KRAFT WAS THE FIRST TO ACT
ONE DAY CONCLUDED KRAFT SOLEMNLY THERE WILL COME TO CYPHER'S FOR A PLATE OF BEANS A MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN FROM WISCONSIN AND HE WILL MARRY MILLY NEVER EXCLAIMED JUDKINS AND I IN HORROR A LUMBERMAN REPEATED KRAFT HOARSELY
WHILE THE SMALL FRONT ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR IN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSE THE ONLY CORNER GIVEN OVER TO THE MASTER IS THROWN INTO THE HALL EITHER THAT THE HOUSE MAY APPEAR LARGER AND HANDSOMER OR FROM SHEER INABILITY TO MAKE SO SMALL A ROOM HABITABLE
OUR GODDESS OF GRUB WAS BUILT ON LINES SO MAJESTIC THAT THEY COULD BE FOLLOWED ONLY WITH AWE HER SLEEVES WERE ALWAYS ROLLED ABOVE HER ELBOWS
THUS THE WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH HIS OWN GUNS WE DROVE HIM FROM THE FIELD AND THEN WE HAD HIM CARTED TO A DISTANT SMALL HOTEL AND PUT TO BED WITH HIS NUGGETS AND BABY SEAL SKINS STUFFED AROUND HIM HE WILL NEVER FIND CYPHER'S AGAIN SAID KRAFT
WE WENT IN CALLED FOR FOOD AND ATE IT WE PAID OR WE DID NOT PAY WE HAD CONFIDENCE IN CYPHER'S SULLENNESS AND SMOULDERING FEROCITY DEEP DOWN IN HIS SUNLESS SOUL HE WAS EITHER A PRINCE A FOOL OR AN ARTIST
PEDESTALLED AND IN BRONZE SHE MIGHT HAVE STOOD WITH THE NOBLEST OF HER HEROIC SISTERS AS LIVER AND BACON ENLIVENING THE WORLD SHE BELONGED TO CYPHER'S YOU EXPECTED TO SEE HER COLOSSAL FIGURE LOOM THROUGH THAT REEKING BLUE CLOUD OF SMOKE FROM FRYING FAT
WE SHUDDERED TO THINK OF MILLY WITH HER VOICE MODULATED AND HER ELBOWS COVERED POURING TEA IN THE MARBLE TEEPEE OF A TREE MURDERER NO IN CYPHER'S SHE BELONGED IN THE BACON SMOKE THE CABBAGE PERFUME THE GRAND WAGNERIAN CHORUS OF HURLED IRONSTONE CHINA AND RATTLING CASTERS
THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD BOTH EDITION AND BINDING WILL DO BETTER TO BUY LARGE PAPER BOOKS OR CURRENT FIRST EDITIONS IN BOARDS THAN HANDSOMELY BOUND VOLUMES UNWORTHY IN TYPE AND PAPER THE PLAIN PAPER OR BUCKRAM COVERS OF A GOOD PUBLISHER ARE
HE WILL PROPOSE TO THE FIRST WHITE APRON HE SEES IN A DAIRY RESTAURANT TO MORROW AND MILLY I MEAN THE NATURAL ADJUSTMENT IS SAVED AND BACK TO CYPHER'S WENT WE THREE AND FINDING CUSTOMERS SCARCE WE JOINED HANDS AND DID AN INDIAN DANCE WITH MILLY IN THE CENTRE
WE WERE AT OUR SUPPER OF BEEF STEW AND DRIED APPLES WHEN HE TROTTED IN AS IF ON THE HEELS OF A DOG TEAM AND MADE ONE OF THE MESS AT OUR TABLE WITH THE FREEDOM OF THE CAMPS HE ASSAULTED OUR EARS AND CLAIMED THE FELLOWSHIP OF MEN LOST IN THE WILDS OF A HASH HOUSE
THE LIBRARY SMOKING ROOM AND DEN IN THE DAYS WHEN FURNITURE WAS DEFINED AS THAT WHICH MAY BE CARRIED ABOUT THE NATURAL BOOKCASE WAS A CHEST WITH A STRONG LOCK THESE CHESTS PACKED WITH PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPTS
AN ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE IN AN ART EXHIBITION THE OTHER DAY I SAW A PAINTING THAT HAD BEEN SOLD FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THE PAINTER WAS A YOUNG SCRUB OUT OF THE WEST NAMED KRAFT WHO HAD A FAVOURITE FOOD AND A PET THEORY
AND THEN GAVE JUDKINS AND ME SUCH AN APPEALING LOOK THAT WE WENT DOWN TO THE LAST DIME WE HAD IN TOASTING OUR GUEST THEN WHEN OUR AMMUNITION WAS GONE AND THE KLONDIKER
HIS PABULUM WAS AN UNQUENCHABLE BELIEF IN THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE HIS THEORY WAS FIXED AROUND CORNED BEEF HASH WITH POACHED EGG THERE WAS A STORY BEHIND THE PICTURE SO I WENT HOME AND LET IT DRIP OUT OF A FOUNTAIN PEN THE IDEA OF KRAFT
THE STUFF THE NIGGERS FEED YOU ON PULLMANS DON'T COUNT YOU GENTLEMEN ORDER WHAT YOU WANT AND THEN MILLY LOOMED UP WITH A THOUSAND DISHES ON HER BARE ARM LOOMED UP BIG AND WHITE AND PINK AND AWFUL AS MOUNT SAINT ELIAS WITH A SMILE LIKE DAY BREAKING IN A GULCH
FOR NOT ONLY MUST ONE KNEEL TO REACH THE LOWER SHELVES BUT THE BOOKS ARE HIDDEN AND ACCESS TO THEM IS OBSTRUCTED BY THEIR BEING ON A LEVEL WITH THE FURNITURE THE GENERAL DECORATION OF THE LIBRARY SHOULD BE OF SUCH CHARACTER AS TO FORM A BACKGROUND OR SETTING TO THE BOOKS
AND SUFFICIENT IN NUMBER TO DOMINATE ALL THE ACCESSORY DECORATIONS OF THE ROOM WHEN THERE ARE BOOKS ENOUGH IT IS BEST TO USE THEM AS PART OF THE DECORATIVE TREATMENT OF THE WALLS
THE WALLS SHOULD BE FREE FROM PATTERN AND LIGHT IN COLOR SINCE DARK WALLS NECESSITATE MUCH ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AND HAVE THE DISADVANTAGE OF MAKING A ROOM LOOK SMALL THE CEILING IF NOT PLAIN MUST BE ORNAMENTED WITH THE LIGHTEST TRACERY AND SUPPORTED BY A CORNICE CORRESPONDINGLY SIMPLE IN DESIGN
OUR FEARS MUST HAVE BEEN PROPHETIC FOR ON THAT SAME EVENING THE WILDWOOD DISCHARGED UPON US MILLY'S PREORDAINED CONFISCATOR OUR FEE TO ADJUSTMENT AND ORDER BUT ALASKA AND NOT WISCONSIN BORE THE BURDEN OF THE VISITATION
PROVIDED AS WE ARE NOW SUPPOSING THE OPENING IN THE PARALLEL WALL HAS BEEN CLOSED A BOOKCASE OR SOME OTHER HIGH PIECE OF FURNITURE MAY BE PLACED ON EACH SIDE OF THE MANTEL AND THERE WILL BE SPACE OPPOSITE FOR A SOFA AND A GOOD SIZED WRITING TABLE
BUT AS PEOPLE BEGAN TO BUY BOOKS FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT THEY CONTAINED LESS EXAGGERATED IMPORTANCE WAS ATTACHED TO THEIR EXTERIOR SO THAT BINDINGS THOUGH PERFECT AS TASTE AND SKILL COULD MAKE THEM
THE QUESTION OF BINDING LEADS INCIDENTALLY TO THAT OF EDITIONS THOUGH THE LATTER IS HARDLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS BOOK PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEGUN TO NOTICE THE OUTSIDE OF THEIR BOOKS NATURALLY COME TO APPRECIATE PAPER AND TYPE
IT HAS ALREADY BEEN POINTED OUT THAT THE PLAN OF BUILDING BOOK SHELVES INTO THE WALLS IS THE MOST DECORATIVE AND THE MOST PRACTICAL
THE WALLS ARE LINED WITH BOOK SHELVES CONCEALED BEHIND SLIDING PANELS A CONTRIVANCE RENDERED DOUBLY NECESSARY BY THE GENERAL INSECURITY OF PROPERTY AND BY THE FACT THAT THE BOOKS OF THAT PERIOD WHETHER IN MANUSCRIPT OR PRINTED
ONE OF US COMPARED THE HARMONY EXISTING BETWEEN A HAYDN SYMPHONY AND PISTACHE ICE CREAM TO THE EXQUISITE CONGRUITY BETWEEN MILLY AND CYPHER'S THERE IS A CERTAIN FATE HANGING OVER MILLY SAID KRAFT AND IF IT OVERTAKES HER SHE IS LOST TO CYPHER'S AND TO US
WAS MADE TO CATCH THE LUMBERMAN'S EYE AND WELL WE KNEW THE HABITS OF THE BADGERS ONCE FORTUNE SMILED UPON THEM STRAIGHT TO NEW YORK THEY HIE AND LAY THEIR GOODS AT THE FEET OF THE GIRL WHO SERVES THEM BEANS IN A BEANERY WHY THE ALPHABET ITSELF CONNIVES THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPER'S HEADLINER'S WORK IS CUT FOR HIM
SHE HAD SEEN FEWER YEARS THAN ANY OF US BUT SHE WAS OF SUCH SUPERB EVEHOOD AND SIMPLICITY THAT SHE MOTHERED US FROM THE BEGINNING CYPHER'S STORE OF EATABLES SHE POURED OUT UPON US WITH ROYAL INDIFFERENCE TO PRICE AND QUANTITY AS FROM A CORNUCOPIA THAT KNEW NO EXHAUSTION
THERE NATURE HAD PLACED HER AND SHE HAD TAKEN ROOT AND GROWN MIGHTILY SHE SEEMED HAPPY AND TOOK HER FEW POOR DOLLARS ON SATURDAY NIGHTS WITH THE FLUSHED PLEASURE OF A CHILD THAT RECEIVES AN UNEXPECTED DONATION IT WAS KRAFT WHO FIRST VOICED THE FEAR THAT EACH OF US MUST HAVE HELD LATENTLY
TO ADORN THE WALLS OF A LIBRARY AND THEN CONCEAL THEIR ORNAMENTATION BY EXPENSIVE BOOKCASES IS A WASTE OR RATHER A MISAPPLICATION OF EFFECTS ALWAYS A SIN AGAINST AESTHETIC PRINCIPLES THE IMPORTANCE OF BOOKBINDINGS AS AN ELEMENT IN HOUSE DECORATION HAS ALREADY BEEN TOUCHED UPON
BUT SINCE A TASTE FOR GOOD BINDINGS HAS COME TO BE REGARDED AS A COLLECTOR'S FAD LIKE ACCUMULATING SNUFF BOXES OR BAISERS DE PAIX IT SEEMS NEEDFUL TO POINT OUT HOW OBVIOUS AND VALUABLE A MEANS OF DECORATION IS LOST BY DISREGARDING THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF BOOKS
WHICH WAS ASSIDUOUSLY CULTIVATED IN THOSE PARISIAN SALONS OF WHICH MADAME DE RAMBOUILLET'S IS THE RECOGNIZED TYPE THE POSSESSION OF A LIBRARY HITHERTO THE PRIVILEGE OF KINGS
HE SAT AT A WORM EATEN DESK COVERED WITH FILES OF WAITERS CHECKS SO OLD THAT I WAS SURE THE BOTTOMEST ONE WAS FOR CLAMS THAT HENDRIK HUDSON HAD EATEN AND PAID FOR
BEAUTIFUL BINDINGS WERE STILL HIGHLY VALUED AND SOME OF THE MOST WONDERFUL WORK PRODUCED IN FRANCE BELONGS TO THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES
ARCHITECTS ARE BEGINNING TO REDISCOVER THE FORGOTTEN FACT THAT THE STUD OF A ROOM SHOULD BE REGULATED BY THE DIMENSIONS OF ITS FLOOR SPACE SO THAT IN THE NEWER HOUSES THE DWARF BOOKCASE IS NO LONGER A NECESSITY IT IS CERTAINLY LESS CONVENIENT THAN THE TALL OLD FASHIONED PRESS
CLOSE TO THE FRONT DOOR WHILE THERE IS USUALLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM FACING THE WINDOW ONE AT LEAST OF THESE OPENINGS BEING AS A RULE OF EXAGGERATED WIDTH IN SUCH CASES THE DOOR IN THE SIDE OF THE ROOM SHOULD BE WALLED UP
LESS AN INTELLECTUAL NEED THAN A TREASURE UPON WHICH RICH MEN PRIDED THEMSELVES IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THAT THE TASTE FOR BOOKS BECAME A TASTE FOR READING FRANCE LED THE WAY IN THIS NEW FASHION
HE LEAPED UP AND POUNDED THE KLONDIKER'S BACK COME OUT AND DRINK HE SHOUTED DRINK FIRST AND EAT AFTERWARD JUDKINS SEIZED ONE ARM AND I THE OTHER GAILY ROARINGLY IRRESISTIBLY IN JOLLY GOOD FELLOW STYLE WE DRAGGED HIM FROM THE RESTAURANT TO A CAFE
HER VOICE RANG LIKE A GREAT SILVER BELL HER SMILE WAS MANY TOOTHED AND FREQUENT SHE SEEMED LIKE A YELLOW SUNRISE ON MOUNTAIN TOPS I NEVER SAW HER BUT I THOUGHT OF THE YOSEMITE AND YET SOMEHOW I COULD NEVER THINK OF HER AS EXISTING OUTSIDE OF CYPHER'S
AND IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ACCORDING TO JOHN EVELYN THE THREE NATIONS OF GREAT BRITAIN CONTAINED FEWER BOOKS THAN PARIS ALMOST ALL THE OLD BOOKCASES HAD ONE FEATURE IN COMMON THAT IS THE LOWER CUPBOARD WITH SOLID DOORS THE BOOKCASE PROPER RESTED UPON THIS PROJECTING CUPBOARD
FOLLOWED THE PRINCE OR NOBLE FROM ONE CASTLE TO ANOTHER AND WERE EVEN CARRIED AFTER HIM INTO CAMP BEFORE THE INVENTION OF PRINTING WHEN TWENTY OR THIRTY BOOKS FORMED AN EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE LIBRARY AND MANY GREAT PERSONAGES WERE CONTENT WITH THE POSSESSION OF ONE VOLUME
THUS UTILIZING THE BOOKS AS PART OF HIS SCHEME OF DECORATION THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY THE MOST PRACTICAL BUT THE MOST DECORATIVE WAY OF HOUSING ANY COLLECTION OF BOOKS LARGE ENOUGH TO BE SO EMPLOYED
BANK DRAFTS FOR TWO MILLIONS WAS HIS SUMMING UP AND A THOUSAND A DAY PILING UP FROM MY CLAIMS AND NOW I WANT SOME BEEF STEW AND CANNED PEACHES I NEVER GOT OFF THE TRAIN SINCE I MUSHED OUT OF SEATTLE AND I'M HUNGRY
THE BEST WAY OF OBTAINING AN EFFECT OF SIZE IS TO PANEL THE WALLS BY MEANS OF CLEAR CUT ARCHITECTURAL MOULDINGS A FEW STRONG VERTICAL LINES WILL GIVE DIGNITY TO THE ROOM AND HEIGHT TO THE CEILING
REFERENCE HAS BEEN MADE TO THE WAY IN WHICH EVEN IN SMALL HOUSES A ROOM MAY BE SACRIFICED TO A SUPPOSED EFFECT OR TO SOME INHERITED TRADITION AS TO ITS FORMER USE
THE SMOKING ROOM PROPER WITH ITS MISE EN SCENE OF TURKISH DIVANS NARGHILEHS BRASS COFFEE TRAYS AND OTHER ORIENTAL PROPERTIES IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED A NECESSITY IN THE MODERN HOUSE
OF THROWING A FILM OVER HIS EYES RENDERING OPAQUE THE WINDOWS OF HIS SOUL ONCE WHEN WE LEFT HIM UNPAID WITH EGREGIOUS EXCUSES I LOOKED BACK AND SAW HIM SHAKING WITH INAUDIBLE LAUGHTER BEHIND HIS FILM NOW AND THEN WE PAID UP BACK SCORES
IN ENGLAND WHERE PRIVATE LIBRARIES WERE FEWER AND LESS EXTENSIVE THE MOVABLE BOOKCASE WAS MUCH USED AND EXAMPLES OF BUILT IN SHELVES ARE PROPORTIONATELY RARER
IN FACT MORE DECORATIVE BECAUSE MORE ARTISTIC THAN SHOWY TREE CALF OR ANTIQUE MOROCCO THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO THE LIBRARY ITSELF PLAIN SHELVES FILLED WITH GOOD EDITIONS IN GOOD BINDINGS ARE MORE TRULY DECORATIVE THAN ORNATE BOOKCASES LINED WITH TAWDRY BOOKS
THE CRIES OF THE HUNGERING AND ALL THE HORRID TUMULT OF FEEDING MAN SURROUNDED BY SWARMS OF THE BUZZING WINGED BEASTS BEQUEATHED US BY PHARAOH MILLY STEERED HER MAGNIFICENT WAY LIKE SOME GREAT LINER CLEAVING AMONG THE CANOES OF HOWLING SAVAGES
SUCH AMBULANT BOOKCASES WERE SUFFICIENT FOR THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MOST EAGER BIBLIOPHILE OCCASIONALLY THE VOLUMES WERE KEPT IN A SMALL PRESS OR CUPBOARD AND PLACED IN A CHEST ONLY WHEN THEIR OWNER TRAVELLED BUT THE BOOKCASE AS NOW KNOWN
IT IS USUALLY CONCEDED THAT COMMON SENSE SHOULD REGULATE THE FURNISHING OF THE DEN FRAGILE CHAIRS LACE PETTICOAT LAMP SHADES AND IRRELEVANT BRIC A BRAC ARE CONSEQUENTLY EXCLUDED AND THE MASTER'S SENSE OF COMFORT OFTEN EXPRESSES ITSELF IN A SET OF OFFICE FURNITURE
I BELIEVE I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO LONGED FOR BOADICEA TO STALK FROM HER FRAME BRINGING ME CORNED BEEF HASH WITH POACHED EGG I HURRIED AWAY TO SEE KRAFT HIS SATANIC EYES WERE THE SAME HIS HAIR WAS WORSE TANGLED BUT HIS CLOTHES HAD BEEN MADE BY A TAILOR I DIDN'T KNOW I SAID TO HIM
TO BE DECORATIVE A BOOKCASE NEED NOT CONTAIN THE PRODUCTIONS OF THE MASTER BINDERS
SINCE THE LATTER WORD SEEMS TO HAVE ATTAINED THE DIGNITY OF A TECHNICAL TERM
THIS I SAY HAPPENED THREE YEARS AGO AND ABOUT THAT TIME A LITTLE LUCK DESCENDED UPON US THREE
AND THE KLONDIKER THREW DOWN HIS PELTS AND NUGGETS AS DROSS AND LET HIS JAW FALL HALF WAY AND STARED AT HER YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THE DIAMOND TIARAS ON MILLY'S BROW AND THE HAND EMBROIDERED SILK PARIS GOWNS THAT HE MEANT TO BUY FOR HER
SHE WILL GROW FAT ASKED JUDKINS FEARSOMELY SHE WILL GO TO NIGHT SCHOOL AND BECOME REFINED I VENTURED ANXIOUSLY IT IS THIS SAID KRAFT PUNCTUATING IN A PUDDLE OF SPILLED COFFEE WITH A STIFF FOREFINGER
JUST AS YOU EXPECT THE PALISADES TO APPEAR THROUGH A DRIFTING HUDSON RIVER FOG THERE AMID THE STEAM OF VEGETABLES AND THE VAPOURS OF ACRES OF HAM AND THE CRASH OF CROCKERY THE CLATTER OF STEEL THE SCREAMING OF SHORT ORDERS
A ROLLER TOP DESK A REVOLVING CHAIR AND OTHERS OF THE PUFFY TYPE ALREADY DESCRIBED AS THE ACCEPTED MODEL OF A LUXURIOUS SEAT
HEAVY CEILING MOULDINGS ARE OBVIOUSLY OUT OF PLACE IN A SMALL ROOM AND A PLAIN EXPANSE OF PLASTER IS ALWAYS PREFERABLE TO MISAPPLIED ORNAMENT A SINGLE CURTAIN MADE OF SOME FLEXIBLE MATERIAL SUCH AS CORDUROY OR THIN UNLINED DAMASK
A MISPLACED ATTEMPT AT QUAINTNESS MAKING IT INCONVENIENT TO SIT NEAR THE HEARTH AND SERIOUSLY INTERFERING WITH THE GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE ROOM WHEN THE CHIMNEY OCCUPIES THE CENTRE OF THE LONGITUDINAL WALL THERE IS SPACE EVEN IN A VERY NARROW ROOM FOR A GROUP OF CHAIRS ABOUT THE FIREPLACE
CONVENIENCE WAS NOT SACRIFICED TO BEAUTY IN EITHER DESK OR CHAIR BUT BOTH THE OLD PIECES BEING DESIGNED BY SKILLED CABINET MAKERS WERE AS DECORATIVE AS THEY WERE USEFUL THERE SEEMS IN FACT NO REASON WHY THE MODERN DEN SHOULD NOT RESEMBLE THE FINANCIERS BUREAUX SEEN IN SO MANY OLD PRINTS
CAESAR HAD HIS BRUTUS THE COTTON HAS ITS BOLLWORM THE CHORUS GIRL HAS HER PITTSBURGER THE SUMMER BOARDER HAS HIS POISON IVY THE HERO HAS HIS CARNEGIE MEDAL ART HAS ITS MORGAN THE ROSE HAS ITS SPEAK I INTERRUPTED MUCH PERTURBED
WINSOME WAITRESS WINS WEALTHY WISCONSIN WOODSMAN FOR A WHILE WE FELT THAT MILLY WAS ON THE VERGE OF BEING LOST TO US IT WAS OUR LOVE OF THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE THAT INSPIRED US WE COULD NOT GIVE HER OVER TO A LUMBERMAN DOUBLY ACCURSED BY WEALTH AND PROVINCIALISM
VERY FOOLISH OF HIM I SUPPOSE BUT THEN HE DON'T KNOW YOU SO WELL AS I DO HE'S PREJUDICED YOU SEE I SUPPOSE SO SAID CHRIS MY WORD HE DID TAKE ON WHEN HE SAW THE MUSTANG COME OVER THE CLIFF AND DRAG YOU AFTER IT
WHILE THE NEXT SHOWED SIGNS OF COOKING IN THE SHAPE OF A CURLING LITTLE COLUMN OF SMOKE THERE WAS WATER IN BUCKETS OUTSIDE ON THE TERRACE WHERE BEHIND A KIND OF BREASTWORK HASTILY PILED UP WATCH WAS BEING KEPT
HARDLY SMARTS SIR IT'S JUST AS IF SOMEBODY WAS PLAYING AT SEWING IT UP WITH A RED HOT SKEWER NICE BOLD REFRESHING SORT OF PAIN TCHAH THAT'S ALL RIGHT
TWO HOLD MY ROPE UP WITH THE BARREL THOSE AT THE SURFACE NEEDED NO SECOND ORDER BUT BEGAN TO HAUL AWAY
TILL THE INDIANS HEAR ME AND COME OUT TO SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER THEN WE SUPPOSE THEY'LL MOUNT THE WHOLE HERD OF THEM AND COME AFTER ME MOUNTED MEN AGAINST ONE ON FOOT SAID THE DOCTOR WITH A SIGH I DON'T SUPPOSE THEY'LL CATCH ME SAID GRIGGS COOLLY
EVERYTHING IS THE GOOD THEY'VE SEEN EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE BUT THEY COULDN'T THINK WITH OUR BRAINS COULD THEY MY LAD BUT WHAT COULD THEY THINK OF OUR HUNTING ABOUT AS WE DID
BUT NOW THE GREAT DESIRE FROM WHICH HE SUFFERED WAS WANT OF SLEEP FOR HE WAS UTTERLY WEARY AND SO STIFF THAT HE COULD HARDLY REFRAIN FROM UTTERING A GROAN
OH WHAT A FELLOW YOU ARE CRIED THE BOY IMPATIENTLY SUCH A ONE AS YOU ARE FOR EATING AND NOTICING EVERYTHING
IT'S A RISK INDEED SAID THE DOCTOR IF THE INDIANS SHOULD HAPPEN TO RIDE IN THIS DIRECTION WHERE SHOULD WE BE SHOOTING AT THEM WOULD BE THE BEST THING SAID WILTON IT'S A THOUSAND TO ONE AGAINST THEIR FINDING THE BEASTS HERE SAID GRIGGS
BUT AS SOON AS WE HEARD YOU BEGIN TO POP AND THE REDSKINS CAME DOWN WE NEARLY WENT MAD WITH JOY I SAW THOUGH HE DIDN'T SAY MUCH OUT LOUD BUT I JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS LIPS MOVING NOW AND THEN AND THE WAY HE SHOT AFTERWARDS
I'M QUITE RIGHT NOW VERY WELL SAID THE DOCTOR WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER DAY AT ALL EVENTS BUT I DO NOT ANTICIPATE MAKING MUCH OF A FIND HERE I DON'T KNOW SIR SAID GRIGGS GRAVELY
THE MULES WERE LADEN WITH THE MUCH REDUCED LOADS SKEETER HAD HIS BUT HIS BELL WAS MUFFLED SO THAT IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY SILENT AND THE WATER BARRELS WERE HUNG IN POSITION ACROSS THE BACK OF THEIR REGULAR BEARER
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE SAID BOURNE SADLY SO'S EVERYTHING ELSE SIR REPLIED THE AMERICAN BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A PITY TO BEGIN FANCYING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN PERHAPS SO SAID BOURNE I BEG PARDON I'M AFRAID I DO ANTICIPATE A GOOD DEAL
BIRDS WILL NOT ENTER A TRAP IF THEY SEE ANYTHING STRANGE NOR INDIANS NEITHER SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY WE SHALL SEE TO THAT AND YOU'LL LET THEM GET WELL OUT OF HEARING BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO STOP THE GAP OF COURSE SAID THE DOCTOR
WELL HE CRIED HALF FIERCELY AFTER A SHORT PAUSE DURING WHICH HE LOOKED KEENLY AT FIRST ONE AND THEN THE OTHER OF THE BOYS
WELL YES A FEW SAID THE AMERICAN COOLLY BUT THEY'RE JUST ABOUT NOTHING TO WHAT YOU COULD TEACH ME I CRIED CHRIS STARING AT HIM IN WONDER
HORRIBLY PANTED CHRIS BUT I DO WISH YOU'D GO AND LET ME SLEEP I WILL SOON SAID NED
SOME VERY TOUGH WOOD I SUPPOSE LIKE THE YEW WITH WHICH THE ENGLISH USED TO MAKE BOWS NAY LOTS OF THEM ARE MADE OF HORSES OR BUFFALOES RIBS THEY'RE HANDY AND SHORT AND TOUGH YOU KNOW WITH WHAT A WHING THEY CAN SEND AN ARROW
WHERE THE DOCTOR CALLED A HALT ONCE MORE BUT ALL WAS STILL AND BLACKER THAN EVER AS GRIGGS WITH CHRIS AT HIS SIDE TURNED OFF TO THE RIGHT TO LEAD THE PARTY SLOWLY ONWARD TOWARDS THE NARROWS WHERE ALL STOOD AT LAST HOT AND WEARY
THEY'RE MADE DIFFERENTLY TO WHAT WE ARE IF THEY CAN WHISPERED THE AMERICAN DRYLY I'M LEAVING EVERYTHING TO MY NAG AND YOU'D BETTER DO THE SAME THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING SAID CHRIS YOU DON'T THINK THAT WAS AN INDIAN THEN NO ONLY SOME LITTLE ANIMAL THAT WE STARTED
TILL GRIGGS HANDS CAME WITHIN REACH WHEN CHRIS AND NED EACH SEIZED ONE TO GIVE THE FINAL TUG WHICH DREW HIM OVER THE EDGE OF THE HOLE
AND LOOKING OUT TO TRY AND TURN US INTO PIN CUSHIONS FOR THEIR ARROWS IF WE'D ONLY GO OUT FAR ENOUGH WHICH WE WOULDN'T DO ON ANY CONSIDERATION BUT THIS WILL QUITE UPSET OUR PLANS FOR TO NIGHT SAID CHRIS OH NO WE SHALL GO ON FOR THIS LOOKS PROMISING MY LAD
MY WORD I FELT BAD ENOUGH
IT ALMOST HAD A NASTY TASTE WHEN IT WAS MADE INTO TEA DIDN'T YOU NOTICE IT HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE BUT THERE WAS NO REPLY
YOU'D BETTER ASK ME SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM AND LIFT UP HIS HOOFS AND POINT AT THEM YES I SEE SAID CHRIS P'R'APS I SHALL ACT A BIT TOO FOR OUR FRIENDS BENEFIT SO DON'T BE SURPRISED
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SAID CHRIS THOUGHTFULLY DIDN'T YOU NOW SAID GRIGGS MOCKINGLY
I SHOULDN'T BE A BIT SURPRISED TO FIND TRACES OF MINING WITH FURNACES AND CRUCIBLES FOR MELTING THE GOLD SOMEWHERE THROUGH THESE OPENINGS
POOR FATHER SAID CHRIS
AND CHRIS MOVED FORWARD GAVE THE PONY HIS HEAD ONCE MORE AND THE CLEVER LITTLE ANIMAL PACED STEADILY ON FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS AND THEN TURNED OFF TO ITS LEFT AND BEGAN TO ASCEND HAH WHO WOULDN'T BE A PONY SAID GRIGGS AS CHRIS DREW REIN
GRIGGS SHOUTED CHRIS EXCITEDLY WHY THERE YOU ARE THE DOCTOR'S GONE THE OTHER WAY TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND A GULLY BY WHICH HE COULD CLIMB UP TO TRY AND FIND YOU I CAME THIS WAY SAME PURPOSE AND I'VE GOT ALL THE LUCK TAKE CARE
I ALMOST BELIEVE I WOULD RATHER HAVE DIED MYSELF CHRIS WAS PERFECTLY SOBERED NOW AND AS NED WALKED AWAY HE LAY THERE IN THE COOL SHADOW WITH A PECULIAR LOOK IN HIS WEARY EYES WHILE FAR FROM DESIRING SLEEP HE COULD ONLY LIE HOT HEADED AND IN FEVERISH PAIN
THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN SAID GRIGGS SO NOW AS YOU ARE GOING TO DIVIDE INTO TWO PARTIES EACH TO TAKE A SIDE I'LL SAY GOOD BYE AND STOP BELOW
ALL PREPARING TO DESCEND THE SLOPE AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH THE BARREL WAS SLUNG AND CARRIED BETWEEN WILTON AND BOURNE TO THE SPOT CHOSEN FOR THEIR CAMP HERE A GOOD FIRE WAS SOON MADE DEAD WOOD BEING PLENTIFUL AND OVER THE EVENING MEAL HASTILY PREPARED
IF THEY HAVE GONE BACK HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE AS THE ADVENTUROUS PARTY SAT TOGETHER TALKING IN A LOW TONE EACH WITH HIS WEAPONS READY YES SAID WILTON IF THEY HAVE GONE BACK SUPPOSE THEY HAVE CHOSEN THIS OF ALL NIGHTS FOR AN ATTACK
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SAID CHRIS STARING NO DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THEIR BOWS ARE OH YOU MEAN THE STRINGS MADE OUT OF TWISTED GUT PERHAPS THAT'S QUITE RIGHT MY LAD BUT NOT WHAT I MEANT I MEANT THE BOWS THEMSELVES
THEN THEY'LL RIDE BACK WITHOUT ANOTHER SHOT BEING FIRED AT THEM FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT I'M HURRYING ROUND TO JOIN YOUR PEOPLE HERE BY THE TOP WAY AND THE GULLY I SHAN'T LOSE ANY TIME AND IF I'M LUCKY I MAY GET HERE SOON ENOUGH TO JOIN YOU IN GIVING THE ENEMY A FEW BULLETS
I DON'T KNOW SAID THE DOCTOR THEY HAD A FIRE BURNING THERE LAST NIGHT YES SAID CHRIS DRYLY I KNOW BUT HE DID NOT THEN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN HOW HE KNEW THEY HAVEN'T SHOWN SINCE THEY FELT THE EFFECT OF OUR BULLETS BUT THEY'RE AS CUNNING AS THEY ARE TREACHEROUS
EVERY ONE GLARED AT THE SPEAKER AS IF WROTH WITH HIM FOR PROPOSING SO SIMPLE AND SELF EVIDENT A MEANS OF GETTING AT THE WATER AT A TIME WHEN THEY HAD ONLY SUCCEEDED AT THE RISK OF LOSING A VALUABLE LIFE BUT NO ONE SPOKE
AS HE ANTICIPATED ANOTHER CHECK WHEN THE PROJECTION WAS REACHED
THREE PAIRS OF HANDS WERE AT THE ROPE NOW AND THEIR OWNERS EXCHANGED GLANCES AS THEY KEPT UP A STEADY STRAIN FEELING THAT GRIGGS WAS TRYING TO CLIMB BUT JERKING THE LINE AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF HIS EFFORTS RESULTED IN A SERIES OF SLIPS
OUGHT I YES THAT YOU OUGHT THOSE FELLOWS SHOOT VERY STRAIGHT AND SEND THOSE THIN SPLINTS OF WOOD WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE THEY DO SIGHED CHRIS MY POOR MUSTANG AH
NOW THEN I WANT TO JOIN FATHER
ARMS THEN I'M ALL RIGHT I TELL YOU ONLY A BIT KNOCKED ABOUT BUT WHERE'S NED
YOU MUST KEEP A SHARPER LOOKOUT GRIGGS HE CRIED YOU FORGET THAT WE ARE WITHIN RANGE OF THEIR ARROWS I SHALL REMEMBER IN FUTURE DOCTOR SAID THE AMERICAN DRYLY DID THAT ARROW TOUCH YOU SAID THE DOCTOR ANXIOUSLY
AND THAT THOUGHT WAS WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE IF THE ROPE BROKE OR THE BARREL SLIPPED FROM ITS FASTENINGS HE SHUDDERED AGAIN AND AGAIN AT THE IDEA AS WITH BOURNE NOW HELPING THE BARREL WAS DRAWN HIGHER AND HIGHER
NO SIR NOT OF INDIANS SUCH AS ROVE THE PLAINS
THE DIAGONAL CUT YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S POISON IN IT DO YOU DOCTOR SAID THE AMERICAN WITH A LOOK OF AMUSEMENT ANY FORM OF DIRT IS POISON TO A WOUND SAID THE DOCTOR DRYING THE PLACE
GRIGGS JOINING IN CALMLY ENOUGH NOW
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE STRETCHED OUT SAID GRIGGS IN A WHISPER I THOUGHT WE WERE NEVER GOING TO GET HERE THEN TO THE DOCTOR
THERE YOU SUCCEEDED NOW DON'T THINK ANY MORE ABOUT IT
THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN WATCHING US MORE OR LESS THEN THEY'VE SEEN US HUNTING FOR A HIDING PLACE FOR THE PONIES AND MULES YES OF COURSE AND CLIMBING ABOUT AMONG THE ROCKS AT THE NARROWS TO BE SURE THEY HAVE THEN WHAT'S THE GOOD OF OUR GOING ON
WELL BOYS HE ADDED TURNING TO WHERE THE PAIR SAT TOGETHER WHISPERING HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT TO NIGHT'S WORK HORRID FATHER WHISPERED NED AS IF HE FELT THAT INDIANS MIGHT BE LISTENING AND YOU CHRIS CONTINUED BOURNE
THEN YOU HAVEN'T BROKEN YOUR NECK NO HOW MANY LEGS ARE SNAPPED
WHEN THEY COME RIDING BACK TO FIND THEIR WAY STOPPED AS IT OUGHT TO BE SAID THE DOCTOR DUBIOUSLY
EVEN IF THEY DID HAPPEN TO COME BUT WE'VE GOT TO CHANCE IT SIR EVERYTHING'S GONE RIGHT SO FAR AND LET'S HOPE WE SHALL KEEP ON THE SAME TRACK I HOPE SO REPLIED THE DOCTOR THEN NOW WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT GET BACK TO THE NARROW GATEWAY
THE SOONER THE BETTER SIR FOR THE NIGHT'S WEARING AWAY FAST BUT OUGHT WE AFTER ALL TO LEAVE ONE OF US IN CHARGE OF THE BEASTS HERE NO SIR SAID GRIGGS SHARPLY
THERE WAS PLENTY OF TIME AND THE DOCTOR'S PRINCIPAL EFFORTS WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS ARRESTING HURRY
I DON'T SAY IT WAS AND I DON'T SAY IT WASN'T MY LAD SAID THE AMERICAN TURNING AWAY CARELESSLY AS IF NOT SEEING THE EXTENDED HAND BUT LOOK HERE IT WAS BAD ENOUGH FOR YOU THAT SET TO WITH THE REDSKINS BUT IT WAS ALL EXCITEMENT AND ACTION
AND WHEN I BEGIN TO FIRE AT THEM PRETTY SHARPLY THEY'LL TURN BACK AT ONCE GET TO THEIR HORSES AND JOIN THEIR MATES TO HAVE A PALAVER AND COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT ISN'T SAFE TO STOP IN THE VALLEY BECAUSE THEY'LL BE EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT FOR FIRE TO BE OPENED BY US
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT CRIED CHRIS WITH A SHUDDER WHY NOT
AND IT WAS DURING THIS RIDE THAT THE BOY BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER THE EYESIGHT OF THE INDIANS WAS MUCH BETTER THAN THEIR OWN FOR HE SOON FOUND THAT ONCE MORE HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE OUT ANY ATTEMPT AT GUIDANCE AND TRUST ENTIRELY TO HIS PONY
NO FATHER NOT UNLESS THEY ARE READY TO DROP AS I DID HOW FAR CAN'T TELL SAID CHRIS WITH AN INVOLUNTARY SHUDDER IT WAS RATHER HORRIBLE AND I WONDER I WASN'T KILLED AND I WONDER TOO SAID THE DOCTOR SOLEMNLY
BUT ALL AT ONCE I DODGE IN AMONG THE STONES AND BEGIN TO CLIMB UP TO THE TERRACES GET UP TO THE TOP STEP WAY IN THE SQUARE PIT AND LOOSEN OUT THE STONES THERE AFTER BLOCKING THE PLACE BELOW
I WAS THINKING OF MOVING OFF SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY AND GETTING TO SOMEWHERE BETTER SUITED FOR A TEMPORARY CAMP YOU COULDN'T GET A BETTER PLACE THAN THIS DOCTOR SAID GRIGGS QUIETLY
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WILL DARE TO DESCEND IN THE DAYTIME FOR THEY WILL BE AFRAID THAT WE ARE WAITING TO FIRE AT ALL WHO SHOW SO COME ON ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN WALK GRIGGS WALK SIR I SHOULD LIKE TO RUN BUT YOUR LEG MUST SMART
THAT IT WAS TOO DARK FOR ANY SCOUTS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO SEE THAT AFTER THE WATERING EVERY BEAST WAS HOBBLED AND HELD IN READINESS FOR THE START THAT WAS TO BE MADE AND NOW THE BUSINESS PREPARATORY TO THE START WAS SET ABOUT EAGERLY
WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE LEG OF MY BOOT SIR SAID GRIGGS COOLLY BUT IT DID NOT GRAZE YOU WHY MAN YOU'RE BLEEDING FAST OH IT'S NOTHING SIR SAID THE MAN HOW DO YOU KNOW CRIED THE DOCTOR
WELL SEEING THAT I MADE A POINT OF SHOOTING A BIRD OR TWO EACH TIME WE WERE PLANNING OUT OUR PLACES AND ALL WE MEANT TO DO I SHOULD SAY THAT THEY THOUGHT WE WERE PROVIDING FOR THE POT NOW THEN COME AND HAVE A TURN AT YOUR PONY AND SPEND A GOOD DEAL OF TIME LOOKING AT HIS HURTS
BUT WHERE ARE THE MULES AND PONIES FATHER SAID CHRIS AS THEY HURRIED NOW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TERRACED CLIFF ON THEIR RIGHT HOBBLED AND GRAZING AT THE FOOT OF OUR CLIFF UNDER SHELTER OF A COUPLE OF RIFLES BUT THERE ARE MORE INDIANS AT THE MOUTH OF THE GULCH
DON'T YOU SAID CHRIS SOBERING DOWN I'M VERY SORRY BUT I'VE DONE THE BEST I COULD PERHAPS SO BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IF I HAD LOST MY PONY I COULD HAVE LAIN THERE AND GRINNED AS YOU'VE DONE POOR BRUTE
YOUR REGULAR RED INDIAN THINKS OF NOTHING BUT HIS HORSE HIS HUNTING AND A FIGHT WITH HIS ENEMIES SO AS TO GET PLUNDER THE PEOPLE WHO MINED FOR GOLD WERE A DIFFERENT KIND OF FOLK ALTOGETHER WELL WE SHALL SEE TO MORROW SAID THE DOCTOR THERE ARE SURE TO BE SOME TRACES OF THEM IN THEIR OLD HOMES
YOU HAD NO TIME TO THINK IT WAS A HUNDRED TIMES WORSE FOR US DOWN BELOW HERE INDEED SAID CHRIS HALF MOCKINGLY YES INDEED I TELL YOU MY LAD I NEVER PASSED SUCH A BAD HALF HOUR BEFORE IN MY LIFE
BUT AS I WAS SAYING YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN A DEAD ONE OVER THAT JOB SQUIRE THE REDSKINS MEANT YOU BUT THEY GOT THE WORST OF IT I SAY THOUGH I COULD TEACH YOU A MANY THINGS
BUT CAN THEY DO IT ALONE OH YES THE BRUTES ARE SAD COWARDS AND DON'T LIKE POWDER AND SHOT AT ALL THERE CRIED CHRIS
BACK THEN AT ONCE GRIGGS WILL LEAD AND ALL KEEP IN TOUCH AND OBSERVE PERFECT SILENCE THE DISTANCE SEEMED TO HAVE DOUBLED BEFORE THEY GOT TO THE DESCENT AND THIS SLOPE TO BE THREE TIMES AS LONG AS THEY TRAMPED SLOWLY DOWN INTO THE GULCH
I FELT THAT IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR A MAN TO DO GRIGGS SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY SO DID I SIR WAS THE FEEBLE REPLY BUT IT HAD TO BE DONE AND I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE A BETTER FINISH OUT OF THE JOB
AND COME CROWDING AFTER ME I RUN AS I NEVER RAN BEFORE STRAIGHT FOR THE NARROW WAY HERE DASH THROUGH MAKING FOR THE OLD CAMP AND THEY TEAR AWAY TO CUT ME OFF BEFORE I CAN GET UNDER COVER OF OUR MARKSMEN
THEY KNOW THERE ARE RIFLES AND GOOD SHOTS UP AT THE TOP YONDER AND I DARE SAY SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN HIT NOW COME ALONG THE PAIR STROLLED OUT TOWARDS WHERE THE ANIMALS WERE GRAZING
UGH IT WAS VERY HORRID WHEN THAT STONE GAVE WAY
AND THEN AFTER DEFTLY DRAWING THE EDGES OF THE WOUND TOGETHER CUTTING SOME STRIPS OF PLAISTER WITH THE BRIGHT SCISSORS READY AND APPLYING THEM TO KEEP ALL PROTECTED FROM THE AIR HURT MUCH HE SAID AS HE WORKED AWAY CHRIS WATCHING THE WHILE AS IF TAKING A LESSON
WE SHALL FIND THAT OUT TO MORROW SAID THE DOCTOR
WE COULD SEE EVERY MOVEMENT EXCEPT WHEN YOU GALLOPED OUT OF SIGHT IT ALL STOOD OUT LIKE A PICTURE AGAINST THE CLEAR MORNING SKY WHILE THERE WE WERE NEARLY ALL THE TIME
YOU BOYS EASE DOWN THE BARREL TILL I SHOUT DON'T LET IT GO WHEN THE WATER GRABS IT LOWER AWAY RIGHT I HAVE IT NOW EASE A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE NOW KEEP TIGHT
AND THEN POSSIBLY FROM EXHAUSTION AND THE RESULT OF THE EXCITING PASSAGES HE HAD GONE THROUGH HIS MIRTH GREW AT ONCE ALMOST HYSTERICAL SO THAT HE COULD NOT CHECK HIMSELF WHY WHAT'S THE MATTER CRIED NED WONDERINGLY HAVE I SAID ANYTHING COMIC
THINK THE ENEMY CAN SEE BETTER THAN WE DO HE VENTURED TO SAY DURING A TEMPORARY HALT TO MAKE OUT IF POSSIBLE WHAT HAD CAUSED A SUDDEN RUSHING SOUND THROUGH THE BUSHES IN FRONT
AND NED DID NOT NOTICE THE BITTERLY SARCASTIC RING THERE WAS IN HIS COMRADE'S WORDS AS HE SAID IN AN ENVIOUS TONE WELL IT'S ALL VERY FINE BUT I SHALL TELL FATHER THAT IT ISN'T FAIR FOR YOU TO BE MADE THE FAVOURITE AND I DON'T THINK YOU'VE BEHAVED WELL
WITH CHRIS KEEPING A KEEN LOOKOUT AHEAD FOR THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF HIS FATHER AND GIVING AN OCCASIONAL LOOK UP TOWARDS THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF WHICH HE NOTED WAS WONDERFULLY BROKEN UP INTO HOLLOWS AND PROMINENCES RIFTS AND GORGES THAT HAD BEEN INVISIBLE FROM A DISTANCE
THAT ONE WELL I THINK IT WAS EITHER ME OR THE DOCTOR BUT WE WERE IN SUCH A STATE OF EXCITEMENT THAT IT'S DOUBTFUL THERE I WAS SURE OF IT FROM THE FIRST CRIED CHRIS HOLDING OUT HIS HAND IT WAS YOU GRIGGS
DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH A COWARD BEFORE COME ALONG DOWN BELOW THERE AND SEE ABOUT A FIRE AND A MEAL SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY LET IT GO NOW GRIGGS YOU DIDN'T FEEL MORE NERVOUS THAN I DID I WAS WORSE I BELIEVE FOR I FELT GUILTY AS WELL FOR LETTING YOU GO DOWN
DON'T START HE SAID BUT GO ON JUST AS USUAL SOMETHING WRONG SAID CHRIS DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD NOT TO DO CALL IT SOMETHING WRONG IF YOU LIKE SAID GRIGGS LAUGHING BUT IT'S ONLY WHAT I EXPECTED
THEN ALL WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS TO WAIT TILL THEY COME UP IT DID NOT SEEM LONG BEFORE THE DOCTOR JOINED THEM AND THEN THE WHOLE TRAIN FILED UP THE SIDE GULLY
THEN WE SHALL END UP BY DRIVING ALL THE BEASTS IN FOR THE NIGHT CLOSE UP UNDER THE SHELTER OF OUR FIRE SHALL WE BE SALUTED WITH ANY ARROWS DO YOU THINK NO SAID GRIGGS I DON'T THINK SO WE'VE RATHER SICKENED THEM OF THAT
WITHIN HALF AN HOUR FROM THESE WORDS BEING SPOKEN THE LITTLE BAGGAGE TRAIN WAS IN MOTION DIMLY SEEN BENEATH THE BAND OF STARS OVERHEAD
AND ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM CHRIS WAS ABOUT TO GO OUT INTO THE VALLEY AND SEE TO HIS PONY EXAMINING THE WOUNDS AND GIVING HIM SOMETHING A LITTLE EXTRA IN THE WAY OF FOOD
I SAY I HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE DIDN'T ALL DISAPPEAR DOWN THAT HOLE AND NEVER COME UP AGAIN IT HAS QUITE UNNERVED YOU GRIGGS SAID THE DOCTOR KINDLY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SIR BUT IT HAS MADE ME FEEL THAT I DAREN'T GO DOWN THAT PLACE AGAIN EVEN IF IT WAS TO SAVE MY LIFE
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN YES WHO WAS FIRING YOUR FATHER OF COURSE YOU'RE PREVARICATING GRIGGS CRIED CHRIS HUSKILY TELL ME AT ONCE WHO FIRED THAT SHOT WHICH ONE WE TUMBLED TWO OR THREE OR MORE OF THE ENEMY DOWN SO DID YOU
WELL YES I WON'T SAY IT DON'T DOCTOR BUT NOT WORSE THAN I FEEL SOMEWHERE ELSE I SAY THOUGH HADN'T WE BETTER MAKE HASTE BACK TO THE FORT YES YOU FEEL FAINT DON'T YOU HORRIBLY SAID GRIGGS GIVING CHRIS A COMICAL LOOK LET'S GO THEN
PUT YOUR FOOT AS LIGHTLY AS YOU CAN TO THE GROUND AND LEAN ON ME WE MUST GET OUT OF BOWSHOT AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN
FROM WHERE IT HAD STUCK IN THE GROUND THAT'S NOT BAD SHOOTING SAID GRIGGS COOLLY HIT HIM DOCTOR
ONE SHOT EACH AND THEN YOU STAND FAST TO GIVE US TIME TO START THE TRAIN BACK BEFORE COMING TO YOUR SUPPORT YES SIR IT'S ALL CUT DEEP INTO ME BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHALL HAVE ANY TROUBLE THERE I HOPE NOT SAID THE DOCTOR
I DO SAID CHRIS IT WAS LOVELY BEING SHOT AT WITH ARROWS AND TUMBLING DOWN THOSE PRECIPICES BETTER THAN ANY DREAM I EVER HAD THE BOY'S FACE LOOKED MIRTHFUL
SUCH OF THEM AS HAD NOT BEEN SEEN FROM THE VALLEY BUT AT LAST HE WAS LYING DOWN IN THE COOL SHADE IN ONE OF THE CELLS AND DROPPING OFF BUT ONLY TO BE AROUSED BY THE COMING IN OF NED WHO WAS EAGER TO HEAR MORE
THINKING OF THE GALLANT WAY IN WHICH THE PONY HAD GALLOPED TO SAVE HIS LIFE
BUT THEY'LL BE PRETTY SHY OF SHOWING THEMSELVES NOW AFTER OUR BIT OF SHOOTING WALK QUICKER SAID CHRIS BUT TELL ME HOW DID THE ENEMY ATTACK YOU THAT'S WHAT WE WANT YOU TO TELL US LAD WHEN THEY BEGAN WE WERE AFRAID THEY HAD GOT YOU
TO BE SURE WE DID SAID GRIGGS EVERYTHING AND PRECIOUS UNPLEASANT SOME OF IT WAS IT BROUGHT US INTO ACTION PRETTY SOON THOUGH MAKING US HURRY UP TOWARDS THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY HERE ON THE CHANCE OF GETTING A GOOD SHOT OR TWO IN AMONGST OUR SAVAGE FRIENDS
SPOILED OUR NIGHT'S REST THOUGH SAID GRIGGS DRYLY FOR THERE WAS NO SLEEP FOR FEAR OF THE REDSKINS STEALING BY US IN THE DARK AND DRIVING OFF THE CATTLE AH SAID CHRIS WITH A SIGH MY POOR MUSTANG
I DON'T WONDER THAT YOU ARE FAINT CHRIS
I DON'T BELIEVE HE MADE A MISS I SAY THE REDSKINS WERE SOON TIRED OF SHOWING THEIR FACES OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF BUT MY WORD CHRIS LAD YOU HAD A NARROW ESCAPE SEVERAL SAID CHRIS SMILING AH YES
ONLY MY NONSENSE DOCTOR SAID GRIGGS CHEERILY MY FAINTNESS IS THE SAME AS SQUIRE'S HERE WE WANT OUR BREAKFAST HORRIBLY OH CRIED THE DOCTOR SMILING
LOWER IT A LITTLE WHISPERED CHRIS HUSKILY AND THE WEIGHT WAS ALLOWED TO DESCEND A FEW INCHES BEING IN THE GLOOM AS IT WENT DOWN UP NOW CRIED CHRIS AGAIN
MIND THESE STONES ARE SLIPPERY YES I'LL MIND SAID CHRIS AS HE DESCENDED THE ROCKS BACKWARDS THIS IS NOTHING BUT HADN'T YOU BETTER RUN AND TELL FATHER YOU'VE FOUND ME NAY I'M NOT GOING TO BRAG I DIDN'T FIND YOU YOU SEEM TO HAVE FOUND ME
IT SOUNDED LOUD BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S SO STILL AND WE EXPECT THAT EVERYTHING MEANS DANGER KEEP CLOSE BEHIND ME NOW
THE OLDEN FOLK PULL PULL PULL CRIED CHRIS WILDLY NO NO CAME FROM BELOW I'M ALL RIGHT ONLY A BIG STONE I LOOSENED WAIT A MOMENT AND THEN LET ME GO ON CHRIS UTTERED A HOARSE GASP AND TURNED FAINT
THOUGH ONLY A FEW MINUTES A TERRIBLY LONG TIME ALL RIGHT AT LAST SHE'S FULL NOW THEN HAUL UP
POOR PLUCKY LITTLE THING HE NEARLY KILLED YOU TOO IN HIS AGONY POOR CREATURE HE WAS SHOT SAVAGELY AH YES SEEMS RATHER HARD ON HIM A HORSE TO BE SHOT BY MEANS OF A HORSE
THAT'S RIGHT SIR I'LL SAY MY LESSON AS SOON AS IT'S DAYBREAK I SHALL MOVE DOWN THE GULLY RIGHT ON IN THE DIRECTION WHERE I BELIEVE THE INDIANS ARE ENCAMPED AND AS SOON AS I THINK I'M NEAR ENOUGH I'M GOING TO BEGIN SHOOTING WHEREVER I SEE A CHANCE AND PICKING UP MY BIRDS
AND ONE NEVER KNOWS WHAT THEY MAY BE ABOUT SOME QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER THE ADVENTURERS WERE ALL IN SHELTER ONE OF THE CELLS OF THE LOWER RANGE HAVING BEEN TURNED INTO A TEMPORARY MESS ROOM
GOT IT CAME FROM BELOW YES CRIED THE DOCTOR ALL RIGHT CAN YOU CLIMB UP THERE WAS NO ANSWER FOR SOME SECONDS AND THEN THE AMERICAN SAID IN A PECULIARLY HUSKY VOICE COMING UP HAUL STEADY
WAS GIVEN IN A QUICK SHARP SHOUT IN THE DOCTOR'S FAMILIAR VOICE AH LOOK OUT HE CRIED AND FOLLOWED UP HIS WORDS BY FIRING BUT BEFORE THE BULLET LEFT HIS RIFLE CHRIS HEARD A LOUD WHIRRING AND SAW HIS COMPANION START VIOLENTLY
THESE STOOD OUT STRONGLY MARKED AGAINST THE EDGE OF THE BLACK CLIFFS ON EITHER SIDE TOWERING UP AND SEEMING TO THE EXCITED IMAGINATION OF THE TWO LADS DOUBLE THEIR REAL HEIGHT AND OVERHANGING MORE AND MORE AS THE VALLEY SIDES GRADUALLY CLOSED IN TOWARDS THE MOUTH OF THE GULCH
NOT A BIT SIR REPLIED THE AMERICAN
HAH SIGHED THE DOCTOR ONLY A CLEAN LITTLE CUT IN THE FLESH I'LL PUT A STITCH OR TWO IN IT WHY IT'S AS CLEAN AS IF DONE WITH A KNIFE
WELL NATURALLY ENOUGH WHEN I SEE THE ENEMY AFTER ME I BEGIN TO RUN BUT SUPPOSE THEY DON'T ALL COME GRIGGS SAID CHRIS SHAN'T SUPPOSE ANYTHING OF THE KIND AND DON'T YOU TALK SO LOUDLY GROWLED THE AMERICAN
IT SEEMED TO CHRIS THAT HE COULD SEE EVERYTHING QUITE PLAINLY AS THEIR HANDS WHICH HELD THE HIDE ROPES WERE DRAWN LOWER AND LOWER THAT'S RIGHT CAME UP IN GRIGGS HOARSE
I FEEL AS IF I SHALL BE GLAD WHEN IT'S TO MORROW AND WE KNOW THE WORST OR THE BEST MY BOY SAID THE DOCTOR CHEERILY THERE I THINK WE MIGHT START NOW THE MOON HAS SET AND WE HAVE A LONG DARK NIGHT BEFORE US FOR OUR WORK
HOW DO I KNOW WHY DIDN'T I TELL YOU THE REDSKINS SPOILED OUR NIGHT'S REST YES WELL THAT MEANS WE WERE ALL WIDE AWAKE AT DAYBREAK THEN YOU SAW ALL CRIED CHRIS
I'VE BEEN UP AT THE LOOKOUT WITH YOUR FATHER AND WE MADE OUT TWO INDIANS CRAWLING TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF OVER THERE JUST LIKE A COUPLE OF BIG RED SLUGS ON A WET NIGHT THEN THEY'RE WATCHING US PANTED CHRIS JUST AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN MY LAD
WHY CERTAINLY NED HAD THE GLASS AND WAS TELESCOPING IN ALL DIRECTIONS UP AND DOWN THE VALLEY LOOKING OUT FOR SQUALLS WHEN HE SUDDENLY MADE US ALL JUMP NEARLY OUT OF OUR SKINS FOR JOY BY SHOUTING OUT THERE'S CHRIS AND THEN YOU SAW ALL THAT HAPPENED
I DID TRY TO BE PLUCKY BUT THAT PLACE BELOW THERE WITH THE WATER TRYING TO SWEEP YOU OFF INTO THE BLACK DARKNESS AND THE END WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME I BELIEVE I NEARLY LOST MY SENSES ONCE
READY AND WILLING SIR I GO FIRST DON'T I YES WITH CHRIS AS ADVANCE GUARD
I LIKED THAT PONY HE MADE ME JEALOUS OF YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT HIM SAID CHRIS QUICKLY I TRIED SO HARD TO SAVE HIM YOU DID MY LAD YOU DID
FEEL OVERDONE SAID THE DOCTOR A LITTLE SIR WAS THE FAINT REPLY CAN YOU GIVE ME A DROP OF THE WATER THIS WAS QUICKLY OBTAINED AND THE POOR FELLOW SWALLOWED IT WITH DIFFICULTY AND THEN SEEMED TO REVIVE A LITTLE
I WAS LAUGHING BECAUSE I COULD FIND THE PLACE HOW ASKED GRIGGS SHARPLY BY COMING FIRST MY PONY KNOWS HIS WAY HERE COME IN FRONT SAID GRIGGS SHORTLY
AND WENT THROUGH THE BIT OF PERFORMANCE ARRANGED CHRIS MARVELLING THE WHILE AT THE PERFECT COOLNESS DISPLAYED BY HIS COMPANION WHO WAS ON THE BRINK OF A MOST DARING ADVENTURE THE VERY THOUGHT OF WHICH SENT THE BLOOD DANCING THROUGH THE BOY'S VEINS AND MADE THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS TURN WET
ONCE MORE GRIGGS STOPPED SHORT AND CHRIS'S HEART BEGAN TO BEAT MORE HEAVILY THAN EVER DURING THE FEW MINUTES SILENCE THAT ENSUED I'M DONE WHISPERED GRIGGS AT LAST WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED CHRIS
HOW TO TUMBLE OVER A CLIFF LIKE THAT WITHOUT DOING YOURSELF ANY WORSE DAMAGE THAN MAKING A FEW SCRATCHES TEARING YOUR JACKET AND GETTING YOURSELF FULL OF DUST THEY HAD BEEN TRAMPING TOGETHER ACROSS THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY AS THEY TALKED ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES
YOU ARE A LUCKY ONE CHRIS HE SAID IN AN ILL USED TONE WHAT CRIED THE BOY ANGRILY BUT THE NEXT MOMENT THE REMARK PRESENTED SUCH A LUDICROUS SIDE THAT HE BEGAN TO LAUGH
AND THEY WENT ON AND ON THROUGH THE DARKNESS TILL GRIGGS SUDDENLY DREW REIN HERE WE ARE HE WHISPERED IT'S NARROW ENOUGH AND IT OUGHTN'T TO TAKE MANY MINUTES TO STOP THIS GAP SO THAT NO HORSE COULD GET THROUGH
WORKING THE ORACLE THE EVENING DREW NEAR AT LAST WITH EVERYTHING MADE READY THAT WAS POSSIBLE THE WATER AND PROVISIONS NEAR AT HAND SADDLES AND BRIDLES EXAMINED
NO SAID THE DOCTOR THAT MIGHT MEAN FAILURE EVERY ONE MUST BE IN HIS PLACE BEFORE THE DARKNESS FAILS US YES I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT SIR BUT MAKE SURE AS SOON AS THERE'S LIGHT ENOUGH THAT EVERY ONE IS WELL HIDDEN
HOW DID IT ALL HAPPEN CHRIS EXPLAINED IN A FEW WORDS AND THEN BEGAN QUESTIONING TO LEARN HOW THOSE HE HAD LEFT BEHIND WERE NEARLY TAKEN BY SURPRISE BUT THEIR PREPARATIONS PROVED TOO PERFECT AND A FEW SHOTS HAD DRIVEN THE INDIANS BACK
THE SHADES OF NIGHT WERE APPROACHING AS AFTER A LONG EXAMINATION OF CHRIS'S PONY THE ANIMALS WERE HEADED TOWARDS THE CAMP AND DRIVEN SLOWLY IN TOWARDS WHERE THEY WERE REGULARLY WATERED EVERY NIGHT AND SO WELL HAD ALL THE PREPARATIONS BEEN TIMED
I HEARD YOUR RIFLE CRACK AND SAW THEM COME OFF THE CLIFF NO NONSENSE GRIGGS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN I SAY WHO FIRED THAT SHOT AND I SAY WHICH ONE THERE WERE SO MANY THE ONE THAT SAVED MY LIFE OH I SEE CRIED THE AMERICAN
CHRIS FELT LIKE A HERO AFTER THE WARMTH OF HIS WELCOME WAS BEGINNING TO COOL DOWN
HERE LET'S GET BEHIND THAT STONE THEY CAN'T TOUCH US THERE GRIGGS WALKED FIRMLY ENOUGH HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE SHELTER SOUGHT FOR BUT HE LIMPED THE REST OF THE WAY AND WAS READY ENOUGH TO SIT DOWN BEHIND THE ROCK
WHILE THE DOCTOR WHO LOOKED ANXIOUS HELD ONE OF HIS HANDS BETTER NOW PANTED GRIGGS THAT'S BEAUTIFUL WATER COLD AND SWEET BUT I SHOULD HAVE TO BE VERY BAD BEFORE I DARED GO DOWN TO GET ANY MORE I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS SUCH A CUR
WHERE THE GRASSY PATCH IN A HOLLOW HAD BEEN SELECTED OFF THE TRACK AND HERE THE HALT WAS MADE THE BEASTS BEGINNING TO GRAZE AT ONCE
CHRIS SUFFERED FROM A PECULIAR SENSE OF EXCITEMENT AND DREAD OF ATTACK AS HE AND GRIGGS RODE CAUTIOUSLY ON THROUGH THE DARKNESS EACH WITH HIS RIFLE COCKED AND RESTING UPON HIS KNEE STRAINING HIS EYES THE WHILE FOR THE FIRST SIGN OF DANGER
THE GULLY OUGHT TO BE SOMEWHERE ABOUT HERE BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHERE IT IS AND WE MUST WAIT TILL MORNING CHRIS LAUGHED SOFTLY I DON'T SEE ANYTHING TO GRIN AT GRUMBLED GRIGGS I DON'T BELIEVE ANY INDIAN COULD FIND HIS WAY ALONG HERE
AND ALL OVERHUNG BY A LEVEL BAND OF APPARENTLY IMPASSABLE ROCK BUT DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF THEIR CHAT THEY HAD BEEN SO DEEPLY INTERESTED THAT NEITHER HAD GLANCED UPWARD TO THEIR RIGHT AND THE FIRST WARNING THEY HAD OF DANGER
WHILE IN AN HOUR IT MIGHT BE MADE SO THAT IT WOULD TAKE A WEEK TO MAKE IT PASSABLE COME ALONG AND MIND WE DON'T MISS THE GULLY HE LED ON AGAIN SLOWLY PAUSING AT INTERVALS TO LISTEN AND MAKE SURE
THERE I DON'T THINK WE SHALL WANT TO GET OUR WATER FROM THAT PLACE AGAIN WHY NOT SAID NED SUDDENLY
AND SLIPPERY IN HIS HANDS GO ON GENTLY
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY WERE OR WHAT THEY DID SAID CHRIS THAT NIGHT AS THEY LAID DOWN TO SLEEP IN THE DARK BOTTOM OF THE DEPRESSION GAZING UP AT THE GREAT LUSTROUS STARS BUT I DON'T WANT ANY MORE WATER GOT LIKE THAT UGH
YOU'LL WANT ALL YOUR STRENGTH AFTER I'VE PASSED TO TUMBLE DOWN THE ROCKS THE MORE THE BETTER IT MUSTN'T BE HALF DONE NO SAID THE DOCTOR GRAVELY THE ENTRANCE MUST BE WELL BLOCKED ALL READY YES CAME IN A WHISPER
THE RASPING OF BOOTS ON THE BLOCKS OF STONE BELOW CONTINUED AND AT THE END OF ANOTHER MINUTE CEASED AS GRIGGS SHOUTED UP THERE I'M ALL RIGHT STANDING ON A BIG BLOCK WITH THE WATER RUSHING ALONG ABOUT A FOOT BELOW ME KEEP TIGHT HOLD NOW
HE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN IN THE LAP OF ONE OF THE SAILORS HAVING HIS BACK STROKED HIS PLEASURE UPON THOSE OCCASIONS WAS EVINCED BY THE EMISSION OF FREQUENT GOOD NATURED GRUNTS AND LOOKING UP INTO THE FACE OF THE FRIENDLY STROKER
I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME SANG THE LARK DESCENDING ONCE MORE I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD REITERATED THE CATERPILLAR WITH AS GRAVE A FACE AS IF IT WERE A FACT
JEFF THE INQUISITIVE BY GENERAL RUSH C HAWKINS AMONG THE GUNBOATS DOING DUTY ON THE INLAND WATERS OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE EARLY SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
YOU BEGIN TO BE RATHER PUSHING THE OLD TREE SAID YOU SHOULD TRY TO GROW A LITTLE BROADER AND STOP THIS SHOOTING UP INTO THE AIR JUST SEE WHERE YOUR BRANCHES ARE SOARING
THE SNOW LAY HIGH OVER THE WHOLE LAND AND EVERY TREE STOOD DEEP IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND DREAMT OF THE SPRING AND WHEN THE SPRING CAME THE GRASS STOOD GREEN AND THE BIRDS BEGAN SINGING WHERE THEY LEFT OFF LAST
THE SUN SHONE ON THEM AND THE RAIN FELL ON THEM SO IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY GREW TALL OH HOW PRETTY THEY ARE SAID THE GREAT OAK AND STOOPED HIS CROOKED BOUGHS STILL MORE SO THAT THEY COULD GET A GOOD VIEW OF THEM
AND WITH THESE WORDS THE BUTTERFLY DROOPED HER WINGS AND DIED AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR WHO HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF EVEN SAYING YES OR NO TO THE REQUEST
AND YET THAT IS BUT A BEGINNING OF WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY CATERPILLAR WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE LITTLE EGGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE BUTTERFLIES TO BE SURE SAID THE CATERPILLAR CATERPILLARS SANG THE LARK
I SEE SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS I KNOW NO REASON WHY THERE SHOULD NOT BE MORE OH CATERPILLAR IT IS BECAUSE YOU CRAWL BECAUSE YOU NEVER GET BEYOND YOUR CABBAGE LEAF THAT YOU CALL ANY THING IMPOSSIBLE
DEAR ME IT IS A SAD PITY YOU CANNOT FLY YOURSELF BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER NURSE NOW SO YOU WILL DO YOUR BEST I HOPE DEAR DEAR
A GREAT OAK CALLED OUT AND SHOOK HIS BOUGHS IN TERROR BUT THE OLD OAK TOOK HIS FOSTER CHILDREN UNDER HIS PROTECTION IT SERVES HIM RIGHT HE SAID HE IS PAID OUT FOR HIS BOASTING
THEN I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE CRIED THE LARK FOR THE BEST OF MY NEWS REMAINS BEHIND YOU WILL ONE DAY BE A BUTTERFLY YOURSELF WRETCHED BIRD EXCLAIMED THE CATERPILLAR
WHICH COMPOSED WHAT COMMODORE GOLDSBOROUGH DESIGNATED HIS PASTEBOARD FLEET WAS THE LOUISIANA COMMANDED BY COMMANDER ALEXANDER MURRAY WHO WAS NOTED FOR HIS EFFICIENCY AND GOOD NATURE HIS TREATMENT OF HIS CREW
WHOM SHOULD THE CATERPILLAR CONSULT THERE WAS THE SHAGGY DOG WHO SOMETIMES CAME INTO THE GARDEN BUT HE WAS SO ROUGH HE WOULD MOST LIKELY WHISK ALL THE EGGS OFF THE CABBAGE LEAF WITH ONE BRUSH OF HIS TAIL
YOU MUST GIVE THEM EARLY DEW AND HONEY FROM THE FLOWERS AND YOU MUST LET THEM FLY ABOUT ONLY A LITTLE WAY AT FIRST FOR OF COURSE ONE CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO USE THEIR WINGS PROPERLY ALL AT ONCE
HOWEVER THERE LAY THE EGGS ON THE CABBAGE LEAF AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR HAD A KIND HEART SO SHE RESOLVED TO DO HER BEST BUT SHE GOT NO SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SO VERY ANXIOUS
THE BEECHES ONLY LAUGHED AND WENT ON GROWING AT LAST THEY CLOSED TOGETHER OVER THE LITTLE OAK'S HEAD AND THEN HE DIED THAT WAS A HORRID THING TO DO
IT WAS IN A LAND DOWN TOWARDS THE SOUTH THERE I TOOK A NAP UNDER THE BEECH TREES THEY ARE TALL SLIM TREES NOT CROOKED OLD THINGS LIKE YOU AND THEIR TOPS ARE SO DENSE THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP THROUGH THEM
THEY ARE TAKING OUR STRENGTH OUT OF US THEY SAID AND SHOOK AS MUCH AS THE BEECHES AROUND WOULD LET THEM THE LAND IS OURS NO LONGER ONE BOUGH DIED AFTER ANOTHER
SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR IN GREAT DISTRESS AND THEN SHE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT TILL AT LAST SHE THOUGHT OF THE LARK AND SHE FANCIED THAT BECAUSE HE WENT UP SO HIGH AND NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WENT TO
TREES BUT TREES THERE WERE IN PLENTY THEY STOOD EVERYWHERE FROM COAST TO COAST THEY SAW THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN ALL THE RIVERS AND LAKES AND STRETCHED THEIR MIGHTY BOUGHS UP TOWARDS HEAVEN
WAS LEFT STANDING ALONE BY THE SIDE OF THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS A PRETTY NURSE SHE HAS CHOSEN INDEED POOR LADY EXCLAIMED SHE AND A PRETTY BUSINESS I HAVE IN HAND WHY HER SENSES MUST HAVE LEFT HER
AND WHEN SHE WAS GOING INTO HER CHRYSALIS GRAVE SHE SAID I SHALL BE A BUTTERFLY SOME DAY BUT HER RELATIONS THOUGHT HER HEAD WAS WANDERING AND THEY SAID POOR THING
POSSIBLY WHILE ESCAPING FROM THE PROSPECTIVE MESS KETTLE OF A CONFEDERATE PICKET IN THOSE DAYS CONFEDERATE PICKETS WERE NOT VERY PARTICULAR AS TO THE QUALITY OR KIND OF FOOD AND I HAVE A SUSPICION THAT EVEN A RAZOR BACK WOULD HAVE BEEN A WELCOME ADDITION TO THEIR MEAL
SAID THE BEAR LICKING HIS PAWS THAT IS ALL THE SHADE YOU CAN GIVE AGAINST THE SUN IF YOU ARE NOT PLEASED WITH ME YOU CAN GO ANSWERED THE OAK PROUDLY
THE KINGS OF THE WOOD DO NOT COME TILL THE WHOLE COMPANY IS ASSEMBLED BUT AT LAST THEY CAME ALL THE LEAVES BURST FORTH FROM THE SWOLLEN BUDS AND THE TREES LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND COMPLIMENTED ONE ANOTHER ON THEIR BEAUTY
IN THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF JEFF'S CHARACTER IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD NONE OF THE USUAL WELL KNOWN TRAITS OF THE PIG HE WAS MORE LIKE A PETTED AND PAMPERED DOG
MORE THAN TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND THEN PATRIOTICALLY DECORATED IN HIS RIGHT EAR WAS A RED RIBBON IN HIS LEFT A WHITE ONE AROUND HIS NECK ANOTHER OF BLUE
I WILL BRING SOME BEECH NUTS WITH ME AND I VOW YOU WILL ALL TURN YELLOW WITH JEALOUSY WHEN YOU SEE HOW PRETTY THE NEW TREES ARE THEN HE MADE OFF BUT THE OAKS TALKED THE WHOLE DAY LONG ONE TO ANOTHER ABOUT THE FUNNY TREES HE HAD TOLD THEM ABOUT
AT LAST WE GET A LITTLE APPRECIATION SAID THE OLD OAK BUT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT WITH OUR LIVES THEN HE SAID TO THE BEECH TREES WHAT WAS I THINKING OF WHEN I HELPED YOU ON IN YOUR YOUNG DAYS
WHAT AN OLD STUPID I WAS BEFORE THAT WE OAK TREES WERE LORDS IN THE LAND AND NOW EVERY YEAR I SEE MY BROTHERS AROUND ME PERISHING IN THE FIGHT AGAINST YOU IT WILL SOON BE ALL OVER WITH ME
IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GO FROM ONE FORE CASTLE MESS TO ANOTHER AND TO INSIST UPON HAVING RATHER MORE THAN HIS SHARE OF THE CHOICE MORSELS FROM EACH IN A SHORT TIME HE CAME TO THE REPAIR SHOP VERY MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR WITH AN IMPAIRED DIGESTION
I AM LORD IN THE LAND AND WHATEVER WAY YOU LOOK YOU FIND MY BROTHERS AND NOTHING ELSE TRUE MUTTERED THE BEAR THAT IS JUST WHAT IS SO SICKENING I HAVE BEEN FOR A LITTLE TOUR ABROAD I MAY TELL YOU AND AM JUST A LITTLE BIT SPOILT
EVERY ONE HAS HIS OWN MANNER OF GROWTH AND WE HAVE OURS ANSWERED THE YOUNG BEECHES THIS IS THE WAY IT'S DONE WHERE WE COME FROM AND WE ARE PERHAPS AS GOOD AS YOU ARE
PERHAPS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO INQUIRE AND HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT IT NEXT TIME YOU GO UP HIGH OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR TIMIDLY THE LARK SAID PERHAPS HE SHOULD BUT HE DID NOT SATISFY HER CURIOSITY ANY FURTHER
BUT IN THIS THE OLD OAK WAS WRONG FOR THEY DID COME TOWARDS AUTUMN THE BEAR CAME BACK AND LAY DOWN UNDER THE OLD OAK MY FRIENDS DOWN THERE WISH ME TO PRESENT THEIR COMPLIMENTS HE SAID
SO SHE RESUMED HER WALK ROUND THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS NIBBLING A BIT OF THE CABBAGE LEAF NOW AND THEN AS SHE MOVED ALONG
AND A CUTICLE THAT SHOWED UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE OF SCURVY FOR THE FIRST HE WAS PUT UPON SHORT RATIONS FOR THE SECOND SAND BATHS ON SHORE WERE PRESCRIBED
AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THE SUN CAME OUT THEY PEEPED DOWN TO LOOK FOR THE BEECHES THEY WERE REALLY A LITTLE UNEASY BUT THEY WERE TOO PROUD TO TALK ABOUT IT AND ONE DAY THE LITTLE SHOOTS DID AT LAST BURST FORTH FROM THE EARTH
JEFF WAS A CONFIRMED LOVER OF GOOD EATING AND IN TIME PAID THE USUAL PENALTY FOR OVER INDULGENCE OF HIS VERY PIGGISH APPETITE WHILE THE MEAL PENNANT WAS UP
AND AM GLAD TO DO YOU A GOOD TURN AND THE FOX ROLLED ON THE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF THE BEECH TREES AND GOT HIS FUR FULL OF THE PRICKLY FRUITS AND RAN WITH THEM FAR OUT INTO THE COUNTRY THE BEAR DID THE SAME
YOU JEST WITH MY INFERIORITY NOW YOU ARE CRUEL AS WELL AS FOOLISH
FOR AS THE FIRST WONDER WAS POSSIBLE THE SECOND MIGHT BE SO TOO TEACH ME YOUR LESSON LARK SHE WOULD SAY AND THE LARK SANG TO HER OF THE WONDERS OF THE EARTH BELOW AND OF THE HEAVEN ABOVE
AND SEEMINGLY WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE EVENT IT MAY BE SAID OF HIM GENERALLY THAT HE WAS OVERFLOWING WITH SPIRITS AND TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN ALL THE DAILY ROUTINE WORK OF HIS SHIP
HIS REWARD FOR THIS UNUSUAL DEMONSTRATION WAS INSTANTANEOUS AND CONSISTED OF SOME APPLES AND A TOOTHSOME DESSERT OF SUGAR AFTERWARD HE MADE THE ROUND OF THE CAMPS WITH A SPECIAL ESCORT OF WARRANT OFFICERS AND DEVOTED JACK TARS
UNDER THIS TREATMENT POOR JEFF LOST ALL HIS BUOYANCY OF SPIRITS AND HIS HABITUAL FRISKINESS AND BECAME SAD AND DEJECTED BUT BORE HIS TROUBLES WITH PATIENCE HE TOOK TO THE SAND BATHS AT ONCE
HOGS OF THIS PARTICULAR KIND ARE FAMOUS SNAKE KILLERS A BIG RATTLER OR A GARTER SNAKE IS ALL THE SAME TO THEM THEY ADVANCE TO THE ATTACK WITH THE GREATEST IMPETUOSITY AND A FEAST UPON SNAKE IS THE USUAL REWARD OF EXCEPTIONAL BRAVERY
WHO GAVE THE LITTLE OAK A CLOUT ON THE HEAD WITH ONE OF HIS LOWEST BOUGHS HOLD YOUR TONGUE HE SAID AND DON'T TALK TILL YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT YOU NEED NONE OF YOU BELIEVE A WORD OF THE BEAR'S NONSENSE
HE WAS SEEN AFTER HE HAD RUN A FEW YARDS TO MAKE A GREAT JUMP AND THEN REMAIN IN HIS TRACKS THE PURSUING PARTY FOUND HIM ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DEMOLISHING A MOCCASIN WHICH HE HAD CRUSHED BY JUMPING AND LANDING WITH HIS FEET UPON ITS HEAD AND BACK
MADE HIM ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OFFICERS IN THE WHOLE FLEET HE ENTERED INTO ALL OF THEIR SPORTS AND SYMPATHIZED WITH THE DISCOMFORTS OF FORECASTLE LIFE HE WAS FOND OF ANIMAL PETS AND ALWAYS WELCOMED THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW ONE
YOU ARE WELCOME AMONG US SAID THE OLD OAK AND GRACIOUSLY INCLINED HIS HEAD TO THEM YOU SHALL BE MY FOSTER CHILDREN AND BE TREATED JUST AS WELL AS MY OWN THANKS SAID THE LITTLE BEECHES
WAS MADE MORE GLORIOUS BY THE EXCHANGE OF CAMP HOSPITALITIES AND AN INDULGENCE IN SUCH SIMPLE HILARITY AS THE OCCASION SEEMED TO REQUIRE BUT JEFF WAS NOT FORGOTTEN EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS BATHED AND SCRUBBED
AND PERHAPS YOU WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO LEAVE ME AT PEACE SINCE YOU CANNOT GIVE ME SHADE THE BEAR STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT AND CLOSED HIS EYES BUT HE GOT NO SLEEP THAT TIME FOR THE OTHER TREES HAD HEARD HIS STORY
AND GAVE FORTH MANY DISGRUNTLED GRUNTS WHEN LIFTED OUT OF THEM THE LAST TIME I SAW JEFF IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO HE WAS BURIED UP TO HIS EARS IN THE COOL SANDS OF THE ROANOKE ISLAND SHORE WITH EYES UPTURNED AND LOOKING LIKE A VERY SAD PIG
BECAUSE OF THEIR LONG LEGS SLENDER BODIES AND GREAT CAPACITY FOR RUNNING AND RAZOR BACKS ON ACCOUNT OF THE PROMINENCE OF THE SPINAL COLUMN THE ORIGIN OF THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES OF THE PORCINE TRIBE IS UNKNOWN BUT THERE IS A TRADITION TO THE EFFECT
BE GOOD ENOUGH TO MOVE YOUR LEAVES A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE THERE HAVE BEEN SCARCELY ANY BUDS ON MY LOWEST BRANCHES THIS YEAR YOU OVERSHADOW ME SO I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CONCERNS US ANSWERED THE BEECHES
BUT I DON'T WANT TO CHATTER ANY MORE WITH YOU JUST NOW I HAVE HAD TO TROT A MILE ON ACCOUNT OF A CONFOUNDED HUNTER WHO STRUCK ME ON ONE OF MY HIND LEGS WITH AN ARROW NOW I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SLEEP
EVERY ONE HAS QUITE ENOUGH TO DO TO LOOK AFTER HIMSELF IF HE IS EQUAL TO HIS WORK AND HAS LUCK IT TURNS OUT WELL FOR HIM IF NOT HE MUST BE PREPARED TO GO TO THE WALL THAT IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD
BY THIS TIME THERE WERE MANY MORE HUMAN BEINGS IN THE LAND THAN THERE WERE BEFORE AND THEY MADE HASTE TO HEW DOWN THE OAKS WHILE THERE WERE STILL SOME REMAINING OAK TIMBER IS BETTER THAN BEECH TIMBER THEY SAID
OH CATERPILLAR WHAT COMES TO YOU FROM THENCE RECEIVE AS I DO
WHAT KIND OF TREES CAN THEY BE WHOSE LEAVES SIT SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP BETWEEN THEM ASKED A LITTLE OAK WHO WAS LISTENING TO WHAT THE BIG ONES WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT BY HIS SIDE STOOD AN OLD GNARLED TREE
AND THE STORM BROKE THEM OFF AND CAST THEM ON THE GROUND THE OLD OAK HAD NOW ONLY A FEW LEAVES LEFT AT THE VERY TOP THE END IS NEAR HE SAID GRAVELY
AND THEY SAID NO MORE BUT THE LITTLE OAK COULD NOT BEAR THE STRANGE TREES IT IS DREADFUL THE WAY YOU SHOOT UP INTO THE AIR HE SAID IN VEXATION YOU ARE ALREADY HALF AS TALL AS I AM BUT I BEG YOU TO TAKE NOTICE THAT I AM MUCH OLDER
BUT WHY DO YOU ASK ME AND THEN DISBELIEVE WHAT I SAY YOU HAVE NEITHER FAITH NOR TRUST OH I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD SAID THE CATERPILLAR NAY BUT YOU DO NOT REPLIED THE LARK YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME EVEN ABOUT THE FOOD
I WILL ASK YOUR ADVICE NO MORE I TOLD YOU YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME CRIED THE LARK NETTLED IN HIS TURN I BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT I AM TOLD PERSISTED THE CATERPILLAR THAT IS
POSSIBLY HOWEVER RATHER MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THE AVERAGE CANINE PET THE FOURTH OF JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WAS A GALA DAY AT ROANOKE ISLAND
DEW AND THE HONEY OUT OF FLOWERS I AM AFRAID SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR NO SUCH THING OLD LADY SOMETHING SIMPLER THAN THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GET AT QUITE EASILY
SHE MADE HER BACK QUITE ACHE WITH WALKING ALL NIGHT ROUND HER YOUNG CHARGES FOR FEAR ANY HARM SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM AND IN THE MORNING SAYS SHE TO HERSELF TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
AND HE PICKED SOME FUNNY THINGS OUT OF HIS SHAGGY COAT HERE YOU MAY SEE WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU WHAT IS IT ASKED THE OAK THAT IS BEECH ANSWERED THE BEAR THE BEECH NUTS WHICH I PROMISED YOU
MANY THANKS ANSWERED THE BEECHES WE CAN GROW VERY NICELY IN THE SHADE AND THE WHOLE SUMMER PASSED BY AND ANOTHER SUMMER AFTER THAT AND STILL MORE SUMMERS THE BEECHES WENT ON GROWING
AND SHELTERED YOU AGAINST THE STORM I LET THE SUN SHINE ON YOU AS MUCH AS EVER HE WOULD AND I TREATED YOU AS IF YOU WERE MY OWN CHILDREN AND IN RETURN FOR ALL THIS YOU STIFLE ME STUFF AND NONSENSE
THUS ADORNED HE WAS BROUGHT ON SHORE TO PAY ME A VISIT AND AS HE CAME THROUGH MY DOOR HE APPEARED TO BE FILLED WITH THE PRIDE OF PATRIOTISM AND A REALIZATION OF THE GREATNESS OF THE OCCASION
AND THE CATERPILLAR SENT A MESSAGE TO HIM TO BEG HIM TO COME AND TALK TO HER AND WHEN HE CAME SHE TOLD HIM ALL HER DIFFICULTIES AND ASKED HIM WHAT SHE WAS TO DO TO FEED AND REAR THE LITTLE CREATURES SO DIFFERENT FROM HERSELF
SAID THE BEECHES SO THEY PUT FORTH FLOWERS AND FRUIT AND WHEN THE FRUIT WAS RIPE THE WIND SHOOK THE BOUGHS AND SCATTERED IT ROUND FAR AND WIDE YOU ARE QUICK PEOPLE LIKE ME SAID THE WIND I LIKE YOU FOR IT
AND GRINNED INTO THE BARGAIN AT THE OLD OAK WHILE HE LAY AND RESTED IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES THE FIELD MOUSE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY OVER HIS NEW FOOD AND THOUGHT THAT BEECH NUTS TASTED MUCH NICER THAN ACORNS
THE BUTTERFLY'S CHILDREN BY MISSUS ALFRED GATTY LET ME HIRE YOU AS A NURSE FOR MY POOR CHILDREN SAID A BUTTERFLY TO A QUIET CATERPILLAR WHO WAS STROLLING ALONG A CABBAGE LEAF IN HER
THEY KILLED MY WIFE AND ONE OF MY BROTHERS AND I MUST SEE ABOUT FINDING A PLACE WHERE I CAN LIVE IN PEACE THERE IS SCARCELY A SPOT LEFT WHERE A SELF RESPECTING BEAR CAN STAY GOODBYE YOU OLD GNARLED OAK TREES
THEN THE OAK'S LOWEST BRANCH DIED AND HE BEGAN TO BE SERIOUSLY ALARMED YOU ARE PRETTY THINGS HE SAID IF THIS IS THE WAY YOU REWARD ME FOR MY HOSPITALITY WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE I LET YOU GROW AT MY FEET
HE MUST BE VERY CLEVER AND KNOW A GREAT DEAL FOR TO GO UP VERY HIGH WHICH SHE COULD NEVER DO WAS THE CATERPILLAR'S IDEA OF PERFECT GLORY NOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING CORN FIELD THEIR LIVED A LARK
AND AT LAST QUITE OVERTOPPED THE LITTLE OAK KEEP YOUR LEAVES TO YOURSELF CRIED THE OAK YOU OVERSHADOW ME AND THAT IS WHAT I CAN'T ENDURE I MUST HAVE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE
OR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE ASKED A POOR CRAWLING CREATURE LIKE ME TO BRING UP HER DAINTY LITTLE ONES MUCH THEY'LL MIND ME TRULY WHEN THEY FEEL THE GAY WINGS ON THEIR BACKS AND CAN FLY AWAY OUT OF MY SIGHT WHENEVER THEY CHOOSE
IT WAS DECIDED TO PUT HIM ON A LIGHT DIET OF MILK WHICH PROVED AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS FOR WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER HIS FIRST MEAL THE PATIENT BECAME AS LIVELY AS POSSIBLE AS DAYS AND WEEKS WENT ON
WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF MY BABY BUTTERFLIES WHEN I AM GONE WILL YOU KIND MILD GREEN CATERPILLAR BUT YOU MUST MIND WHAT YOU GIVE THEM TO EAT CATERPILLAR THEY CANNOT OF COURSE LIVE ON YOUR ROUGH FOOD
AND WHEN SHE WAS A BUTTERFLY AND WAS GOING TO DIE AGAIN SHE SAID
AND THE CATERPILLAR TALKED ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE TO HER RELATIONS OF THE TIME WHEN SHE SHOULD BE A BUTTERFLY BUT NONE OF THEM BELIEVED HER SHE NEVERTHELESS HAD LEARNT THE LARK'S LESSON OF FAITH
SOON AFTERWARDS HOWEVER HE WENT SINGING UPWARDS INTO THE BRIGHT BLUE SKY BY DEGREES HIS VOICE DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TILL THE GREEN CATERPILLAR COULD NOT HEAR A SOUND
AS WELL AS YOU DO LOOK AT MY LONG GREEN BODY AND THESE ENDLESS LEGS AND THEN TALK TO ME ABOUT HAVING WINGS AND A PAINTED FEATHERY COAT FOOL AND FOOL YOU CRIED THE INDIGNANT LARK
WAS PLAYFUL GOOD NATURED AND EXPRESSED PLEASURE PAIN ANGER AND DESIRE WITH VARIOUS SQUEALS AND GRUNTS DELIVERED WITH A VARIETY OF INTONATIONS THAT WERE VERY EASILY INTERPRETED
INTERRUPTED THE LARK HOW AM I TO LEARN FAITH ASKED THE CATERPILLAR AT THAT MOMENT SHE FELT SOMETHING AT HER SIDE SHE LOOKED ROUND EIGHT OR TEN LITTLE GREEN CATERPILLARS WERE MOVING ABOUT
HE ATTACHED HIMSELF TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE SHIP HE HAD NO FAVORITES BUT WAS HAIL FELLOW WELL MET WITH ALL HE DEVELOPED ALL THE PLAYFUL QUALITIES OF A PUPPY AND REASONED OUT A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS IN HIS OWN WAY
AND NOT ONE OF MY ACORNS HAS SPROUTED UNDER YOUR SHADE BUT BEFORE I DIE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE NAME YOU GIVE TO SUCH CONDUCT THAT WILL NOT TAKE LONG TO SAY OLD FRIEND ANSWERED THE BEECHES
AND OF GOOD FAMILY BESIDES THE BEECHES LAUGHED WITH THEIR LITTLE TINY GREEN LEAVES BUT SAID NOTHING SHALL I BEND MY BRANCHES A LITTLE ASIDE SO THAT THE SUN CAN SHINE BETTER ON YOU THE OLD TREE ASKED POLITELY
BUT I FIND THAT HE IS FOOLISH AND SAUCY INSTEAD
NEVER SAID THE CATERPILLAR INDIGNANTLY IT WAS THEIR DYING MOTHER'S LAST REQUEST THAT I SHOULD DO NO SUCH THING THEIR DYING MOTHER KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE MATTER PERSISTED THE LARK
IN THIS ACT OF COURTESY HE IS ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY THE OFFICER OF THE DECK AND OFTEN BY OTHERS THAT MAY HAPPEN TO BE AT HAND AFTER THE ADVENT OF JEFF WHENEVER I WENT ON BOARD THE LOUISIANA HE WAS ALWAYS AT THE GANGWAY
ALL ROUND NEW LITTLE BEECH TREES SHOT UP WHICH GREW JUST AS FAST AS THEIR PARENTS AND LOOKED AS GREEN AND AS HAPPY AS IF THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE WAS
THE BEAR THE WOLF AND THE FOX WENT OUT HUNTING WHILE THE STAG GRAZED BY THE EDGE OF THE FEN THE FIELD MOUSE SAT OUTSIDE HIS HOLE AND ATE ACORNS AND THE BEAVER BUILT HIS ARTISTIC HOUSES BY THE RIVER BANKS
WE ARE ALL OAK TREES THEY SAID WE OWN THE LAND AND RULE OVER IT AND THEY WERE RIGHT THERE WERE ONLY A FEW HUMAN BEINGS THERE IN THOSE DAYS AND THOSE THAT THERE WERE WERE NOTHING BETTER THAN WILD ANIMALS
HOW WILL YOU BE ABLE TO HOLD OUT WHEN A REGULAR STORM COMES I ASSURE YOU THE WIND GIVES ONE'S HEAD A GOOD SHAKING MY OLD BOUGHS HAVE CREAKED MANY A TIME AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BECOME OF THE FLIMSY FINERY THAT YOU STICK UP IN THE AIR
HE WAS A PERFECTLY BLACK PIG OF THE RACER RAZOR BACK ORDER WHICH AT THAT TIME WERE PLENTIFUL IN THE COAST SECTIONS OF THE MORE SOUTHERN OF THE SLAVE HOLDING STATES THEY WERE CALLED RACERS
ONE DAY THE BEAR CAME TRUDGING ALONG AND LAY DOWN AT FULL BREADTH UNDER A GREAT OAK TREE ARE YOU THERE AGAIN YOU ROBBER SAID THE OAK AND SHOOK A LOT OF WITHERED LEAVES DOWN OVER HIM YOU SHOULD NOT SQUANDER YOUR LEAVES MY OLD FRIEND
WHEN ON SHORE HE FOLLOWED HIS FAVORITES LIKE A DOG AND WAS NEVER KNOWN TO ROOT EXCEPT IN SPEECH AND APPEARANCE HE WAS THE COUNTERPART OF A HAPPY GOOD NATURED AND WELL CARED FOR HOUSEHOLD DOG
THE DOCTOR WAS CONSULTED AND AFTER A CAREFUL DIAGNOSIS DECIDED THERE WAS NO ORGANIC DISEASE WANT OF PARENTAL CARE WANT OF NOURISHMENT AND EXPOSURE WERE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR JEFF'S UNFAVORABLE CONDITION
AND HAD ALREADY MADE A SHOW OF A HOLE IN THE CABBAGE LEAF THEY HAD BROKEN FROM THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS SHAME AND AMAZEMENT FILLED OUR GREEN FRIEND'S HEART BUT JOY SOON FOLLOWED
BUT THE OLD OAK GAZED SADLY OUT OVER THE WOOD THE LIGHT GREEN BEECH LEAVES WERE PEEPING OUT EVERYWHERE AND THE OAKS WERE SIGHING AND BEWAILING THEIR DISTRESS TO ONE ANOTHER
HIS PARTICULAR ADMIRERS DECLARED THAT HE LEARNED THE MEANING OF THE DIFFERENT WHISTLES OF THE BOATSWAIN THAT HE KNEW WHEN THE MEAL PENNANT WAS HOISTED TO THE PEAK COULD TELL WHEN THE CREW WAS BEAT TO QUARTERS FOR DRILL
I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR HASTILY WELL THEN FIRST OF ALL I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THESE LITTLE CREATURES ARE TO EAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS TO BE GUESS
IF THEY COME I WILL KILL THEM SAID THE LITTLE OAK TREE BUT DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS HE GOT ONE ON THE HEAD FROM THE OLD OAK IF THEY COME YOU SHALL TREAT THEM POLITELY YOU YOUNG DOG SAID HE BUT THEY WILL NOT COME
THAT IS NOT A POLITE WAY OF SPEAKING TO AN OLD TREE WITH MOSS ON HIS BOUGHS SAID THE OAK I BEGIN TO REPENT THAT I WAS SO KIND TO YOU IF YOU HAVE A SPARK OF HONOURABLE FEELING ALIVE IN YOU
NO SCHOOL NOW SAID BENNY HOPEFULLY NO BUT I CAN TEACH YOU
BUT IT'S LOTS OF FUN TO RUN YOU KNOW HE WAS DRESSED AND READY BY THIS TIME HOW LIGHT HE FELT HE FELT AS IF HE COULD ALMOST FLY PRESENTLY THE CONTESTANTS WERE ALL MARSHALLED OUT TO THE RUNNING TRACK HENRY WAS NUMBER FOUR
HE HAD RATHER HARD LINES AROUND HIS MOUTH BUT SOFTER ONES AROUND HIS EYES PRINTED ON THE GROUND GLASS TOP OF HIS DOOR WERE THESE WORDS IN BLACK AND GOLD J H CORDYCE PRESIDENT PRIVATE
WE COULD WHITTLE OUT LETTERS LIKE TYPE MAKE EACH LETTER BACKWARDS YOU KNOW AND STAMP THEM ON PAPER FINISHED VIOLET THERE WOULD BE ONLY TWENTY SIX IN ALL IT WOULDN'T BE AWFULLY HARD SAID JESS WE WOULDN'T BOTHER WITH CAPITALS
WHAT COULD WE USE FOR INK VIOLET WONDERED WRINKLING HER FOREHEAD
SO HE HOPPED IN CAN'T GO MYSELF SAID DOCTOR MC ALLISTER I'LL JUST DROP YOU AT THE GROUNDS THERE'S NO CHARGE FOR ADMITTANCE YOU JUST WATCH ALL THE EVENTS AND REPORT TO ME WHO WINS HENRY TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HIS FRIEND THAT HE OUGHT TO BE WORKING BUT THERE WAS ACTUALLY NO TIME
I SAID MY NAME WAS HENRY JAMES REPEATED HENRY THAT'S ALL RIGHT SO IT IS AFFIRMED JESS IT'S CLEVER TOO YOU CAN USE THAT NAME FOR YOUR BANK BOOK SO I CAN SAID HENRY DELIGHTED I'LL PUT IT IN THE BANK THIS VERY AFTERNOON
BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH HE DID NOT SEEM TO MIND THIS GREATLY IT'S FUN TO RUN ANYHOW HE THOUGHT IT WAS FUN CERTAINLY HE FELT AS IF HIS LIMBS WERE STRUNG TOGETHER ON SPRINGS
HE RAN EASILY WITHOUT EFFORT EACH STEP BOUNDING INTO THE NEXT LIKE AN ELASTIC AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF THIS HENRY HAD A NEW THOUGHT NOW YOU'VE TRIED HOW EASY YOU CAN RUN LET'S SEE HOW FAST YOU CAN RUN
AS SHE SAT BY CRUSHING THE JUICE FROM THE BERRIES WITH A STICK JESS PLANNED THE INK PAD WE'LL HAVE TO USE A SMALL PIECE OF THE WASH CLOTH I'M AFRAID SHE SAID AT LAST BUT FINALLY THEY WERE OBLIGED TO CUT OFF ONLY THE UNEVEN BITS OF CLOTH WHICH HUNG AROUND THE EDGES
AND IN COMPANY WITH THREE OTHER EXTREMELY RICH MEN HE ARRANGED ONCE A YEAR A FIELD DAY FOR THE TOWN OF INTERVALE
AND THEN NOT ONLY HENRY HIMSELF BUT THE ENORMOUS CROWD AS WELL BEGAN TO SEE HOW FAST HE COULD RUN SLOWLY HE GAINED ON THE FELLOW AHEAD OF HIM AND PASSED HIM WITH THE NEXT FELLOW AS A GOAL HE GRADUALLY CREPT ALONGSIDE AND PASSED HIM WITH A SPURT THE CROWD SHOUTED ITSELF HOARSE
AND BY THE WAY I BROUGHT SOMETHING FOR DINNER TONIGHT JESS LOOKED IN THE BAG THERE WERE A DOZEN SMOOTH BROWN POTATOES I KNOW HOW TO COOK THOSE SAID JESS NODDING HER HEAD WISELY YOU JUST WAIT CAN'T WAIT HARDLY
LET'S MAKE ONE SUGGESTED VIOLET SHAKING HER HAIR BACK WE HAVE SAVED ALL THE WRAPPING PAPER OFF THE BUNDLES YOU KNOW JESS WAS STARING OFF INTO SPACE AS SHE ALWAYS DID WHEN SHE HAD A BRIGHT IDEA VIOLET SHE CRIED AT LAST REMEMBER THOSE CHIPS
AND GATHERED A CUPFUL OF BLACKBERRIES
WHICH HAD TO STAND ON ITS HEAD ALWAYS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FLOOR TO IT AFTER SUPPER THE CHILDREN STILL WERE NOT TOO SLEEPY TO SHOW HENRY THE NEW PRIMER
HE SAT WITH HIS FINGER ON HIS LIP BUT THE CHILDREN WERE NEARLY PETRIFIED WITH ASTONISHMENT TO SEE WATCH COCK HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND GRAVELY PUT HIS PAW ON THE CENTER OF THE WORD NOW THIS WAS ONLY AN ACCIDENT
BUT HE COULD NOT TELL THE TWO WORDS APART DON'T YOU SEE BENNY JESS EXPLAINED PATIENTLY THIS ONE WITH THE WIGGLY S SAYS SEE BUT BENNY DID NOT SEE I'LL TELL YOU JESS SAID VIOLET AT LAST LET'S PRINT EACH WORD AGAIN ON A SEPARATE CARD
SO IT HAPPENED THAT THIS WAS THE MAIN THOUGHT IN HIS MIND WHEN THE STARTER'S GONG SOUNDED AND THE RACERS SHOT AWAY DOWN THE TRACK
HENRY DID NOT KNOW THAT THE FELLOW AHEAD HAD BEEN AHEAD ALL THE WAY AND JUST BECAUSE HE HENRY
HE REPEATED OVER AND OVER THE NAME OF EACH WINNER AS IT APPEARED ON THE HUGE SIGNBOARD IT WAS NEARLY ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN THE FREE FOR ALL RUNNING RACE WAS ANNOUNCED WHAT DO THEY MEAN FREE FOR ALL ASKED HENRY OF A SMALL BOY AT HIS SIDE
HE SORTED OUT CHIPS VERY CHEERFULLY AND WATCHED HIS TEACHERS WITH INTEREST AS THEY DUG CAREFULLY AROUND THE LETTERS WITH THE TWO KNIVES WE'LL TEACH HIM TWO WORDS TO BEGIN WITH SAID JESS THEN WE WON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE WHOLE ALPHABET AT ONCE LET'S BEGIN TO TEACH HIM SEE
SO ONLY THREE PIECES OF TYPE IN ALL VIOLET JESS CUT THE WIGGLY S BECAUSE SHE HAD THE BETTER KNIFE
HE HEARD THE DOCTOR CALL TO HIM FROM THE ROAD SO HE PROMPTLY TURNED OFF THE HOSE AND RAN OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS WANTED HOP IN COMMANDED THE DOCTOR NOT STOPPING HIS ENGINE YOU OUGHT TO GO TO SEE THE STUNTS AT THE ATHLETIC MEET IT'S FIELD DAY HENRY DID NOT WISH TO DELAY THE DOCTOR
BOYS WERE IN TRAINING FOR MILES AROUND GETTING READY FOR INTERVALE'S FIELD DAY AND NOT ONLY BOYS BUT MEN ALSO OLD AND YOUNG AND GIRLS OF ALL AGES INTO THE BARGAIN
IN FACT BOTH GIRLS HAD LEARNED TO TELL THE TIME VERY ACCURATELY BY THE SUN JESS STARTED UP A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FIRE OF CONES AS THEY TURNED INTO RED HOT ASHES AND BEGAN TO TOPPLE OVER ONE BY ONE INTO THE GLOWING PILE JESS LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY
TO SHOW HIM HOW THE S SOUNDED THEN SHE MIXED THE CARDS AND SAID ENCOURAGINGLY NOW BENNY
WHEN THIS WAS SEWED FIRMLY INTO PLACE AND PUT INTO A SMALL SAUCER JESS POURED ON THE PURPLE JUICE EVEN BENNY CAME UP ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES TO WATCH HER STAMP THE FIRST S IT CAME OUT BEAUTIFULLY ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THE PRIMER
HE LEFT IT ALONE FOR OVER FORTY YEARS YOU SEE EXPLAINED DOCTOR MC ALLISTER WHEN HENRY ARRIVED AT HIS LITTLE HOME IN THE WOODS WITH THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS
THAT'S THE WAY THEY DO AT SCHOOL AND THEN LET HIM POINT TO SEE THE GIRLS DID THIS USING SQUARES OF STIFF BROWN PAPER THEN THEY CALLED BENNY VERY CAREFULLY JESS EXPLAINED AGAIN WHICH WORD SAID SEE HISSING LIKE A HUGE SNAKE
BENNY HAD LEARNED BOTH WORDS PERFECTLY GOOD OLD WATCH SAID JESS IT ISN'T REALLY HARD AT ALL SAID BENNY IS IT WATCH DURING ALL THIS EXPERIMENT JESS HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HER DINNER WHEN YOU ARE LIVING OUTDOORS ALL THE TIME YOU DO NOT FORGET THINGS LIKE THAT
WHY JUST ANYBODY EXPLAINED THE BOY CURIOUSLY DIDN'T YOU EVER SEE ONE DIDN'T YOU SEE THE ONE LAST YEAR NO SAID HENRY THE BOY LAUGHED THAT WAS A FUNNY ONE HE SAID THERE WAS A COLLEGE RUNNER IN IT AND A COUPLE OF FAT MEN AND SOME GIRLS LOTS OF PEOPLE
AND ALLOW BENNY TO DISPLAY HIS FIRST READING LESSON HENRY GREATLY TAKEN WITH THE IDEA SAT UP UNTIL IT WAS ALMOST DARK CHIPPING OUT THE REMAINING LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET IF YOU SHOULD EVER CARE TO SEE THIS INTERESTING PRIMER WHICH WAS FINALLY TEN PAGES IN LENGTH
KNOCK THEM ON THE SIDE AND SCOOP THEM OUT WITH A SPOON AND PUT BUTTER ON TOP THE CHILDREN DID AS THE LITTLE COOK REQUESTED SPRINKLED ON A LITTLE SALT FROM THE SALT SHAKER AND TOOK A TASTE AH SAID HENRY IT'S
WATCH DID NOT REALLY KNOW ONE OF THE WORDS FROM THE OTHER BUT BENNY THOUGHT HE DID
AND THE LITTLE COLORED BOY OVER THERE WON IT YOU JUST OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN THAT BOY RUN HE WENT SO FAST YOU COULDN'T SEE HIS LEGS BEAT THE COLLEGE RUNNER YOU KNOW HENRY GAZED AT THE WINNER OF LAST YEAR'S RACE HE WAS SMALLER THAN HENRY BUT APPARENTLY OLDER
THE FIELD ALL ALONG THE COURSE WAS BLACK WITH PEOPLE HENRY COULD HEAR THEM CHEERING FOR NUMBER FOUR AS HE POUNDED BY SIX RUNNERS REMAINED AHEAD OF HIM HERE WAS THE KIND OF RACE THE CROWD LOVED NOT AN EASILY WON AFFAIR BETWEEN TWO RUNNERS
HE LIKED THE LOOK OF HENRY'S FACE AS HE PAUSED TO ASK IN AN UNDERTONE WHERE DID YOU TRAIN NEVER TRAINED REPLIED HENRY I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW THESE FELLOWS HAVE BEEN TRAINING ALL THE YEAR OBSERVED THE MAN YOU DON'T EXPECT TO WIN
AND THE MOMENT THEY WERE DONE SHE HAD DRAINED OFF THE WATER IN A REMARKABLE DRAINER AND HEAPED THEM ON THE BIGGEST DISH WITH MELTED BUTTER ON TOP
PRIZES WERE OFFERED FOR TENNIS BASEBALL ROWING SWIMMING RUNNING AND EVERY IMAGINABLE TYPE OF ATHLETIC FEAT BUT USUALLY THE INTEREST OF THE DAY CENTERED ON A FREE FOR ALL RACE OF ONE MILE WHICH EVERYONE ENJOYED AND A GREAT MANY PEOPLE ENTERED
HE BEGAN TO SPURT HE PASSED NUMBERS FOURTEEN AND THREE HE PASSED TWENTY FIVE SIX AND ONE ALMOST IN A BUNCH NUMBER SIXTEEN REMAINED AHEAD THEN HENRY BEGAN TO THINK OF WINNING
ONCE A YEAR J H CORDYCE ALLOWED HIMSELF A HOLIDAY IF HE HAD A WEAKNESS IT WAS FOR HEALTHY BOYS BOYS RUNNING WITHOUT THEIR HATS BOYS JUMPING BOYS THROWING RINGS BOYS SWIMMING BOYS VAULTING WITH A LONG POLE
IT WAS ABOUT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MEAL OF ALL IN FACT WHEN THE CHILDREN IN LATER YEARS RECALLED THEIR DIFFERENT FEASTS THEY ALWAYS CAME BACK TO THE BAKED POTATOES ROASTED IN THE ASHES OF THE PINE CONES HENRY SAID IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE POKED WITH A BLACK BIRCH STICK
NOW HENRY HAD NEVER BEEN TRAINED TO RUN BUT THE BOY POSSESSED AN UNUSUAL QUANTITY OF COMMON SENSE
O O SEE ME COME COME TO ME COME TO SEE ME CAT RAT
HOW MUCH THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR PRIZE WOULD MEAN TO JESS AND THE REST NUMBER SIXTEEN MUST BE PASSED I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE HE SAID QUIETLY IN HIS OWN MIND I'LL BET YOU I AM THE THOUGHT LENT HIM SPEED NUMBER FOUR NUMBER FOUR YELLED THE CROWD
YOU MIGHT EXAMINE THIS FAITHFUL COPY OF ITS FIRST PAGE WHICH REQUIRED FOUR DAYS FOR ITS COMPLETION ILLUSTRATION PAGE ONE SEE ME SEE ME
JESS HAND SHOOK WITH PURE PRIDE AS SHE STAMPED IT EVENLY ON THE PAGE AT LAST THE TWO WORDS WERE COMPLETED IN FACT THEY WERE DONE LONG BEFORE BENNY HAD THE SLIGHTEST IDEA HIS SISTERS WERE READY FOR HIM HE CAME WILLINGLY ENOUGH FOR HIS FIRST LESSON
BENNY SAID IT WAS BECAUSE JESS NEARLY BURNED THEM UP
HE HAD GONE IN FACT TO THE DRESSING ROOM WHERE BOYS OF ALL SIZES WERE PUTTING ON SANDALS AND RUNNING TRUNKS A MAN STEPPED UP TO HIM QUICKLY
I REMEMBER AN OLD UNCLE OF MINE WHO PUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE SAVINGS BANK AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT HE LEFT IT IN THERE TILL HE DIED AND IT CAME TO ME IT AMOUNTED TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WHEW SAID HENRY
MORE EDUCATION WITH TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IN HIS HAND HENRY FELT LIKE A MILLIONAIRE AS HE EDGED THROUGH THE CROWD TO THE GATE THAT'S THE BOY HE HEARD MANY A PERSON SAY WHEN HE WAS FORCED TO HOLD HIS SILVER CUP IN VIEW OUT OF HARM'S WAY
SHE HAD ALREADY SCRUBBED THE SMOOTH POTATOES AND DRIED THEM CAREFULLY SHE NOW POKED THEM ONE BY ONE INTO THE GLOWING ASHES WITH A STICK FROM A BIRCH TREE WHENEVER A POTATO LIT UP DANGEROUSLY SHE GAVE IT A POKE INTO A NEW POSITION
WHEN DOCTOR MC ALLISTER DROVE INTO HIS YARD HE FOUND A BOY WASHING THE CONCRETE DRIVES AS CALMLY AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED HE CHUCKLED QUIETLY FOR HE HAD STOPPED AT THE FAIR GROUNDS FOR A FEW MINUTES HIMSELF AND HELD A LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH THE SCORE KEEPER
THE TWO GIRLS CLAPPED THEIR HANDS WON'T HENRY BE SURPRISED WHEN HE FINDS THAT BENNY CAN READ NOW FROM THIS CONVERSATION BENNY GATHERED THAT THIS TYPE BUSINESS WOULD TAKE HIS SISTERS QUITE A WHILE TO PREPARE SO HE WAS NOT MUCH WORRIED ABOUT HIS PART OF THE WORK IN FACT
HENRY CALLED BACK AS HE WENT TO WORK WHEN HE HAD GONE BENNY FROLICKED AROUND NOISILY WITH THE DOG
YOU SAID THAT A LONG TIME AGO SAID BENNY WELL ISN'T IT TRUE DEMANDED HENRY ROLLING HIS BROTHER OVER ON THE PINE NEEDLES COME SAID VIOLET BREATHLESSLY FORGETTING TO RING THE BELL HOLD THEM WITH LEAVES DIRECTED JESS BECAUSE THEY'RE TERRIBLY HOT
HE BENT DOUBLE AND PUT ALL HIS ENERGY INTO THE LAST ELASTIC BOUND HE PASSED NUMBER SIXTEEN AND SHOT UNDER THE WIRE THEN THE CROWD WENT WILD IT SCRAMBLED OVER AND UNDER THE FENCE CHEERING AND BLOWING ITS HORNS
MISTER CORDYCE SMILED ABOUT HIS EYES AS HE CLOSED HIS DESK ORDERED HIS LIMOUSINE AND WENT OUT AND LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS OFFICE THE MILL HAD BEEN CLOSED DOWN FOR THE DAY
WHEN HENRY FAITHFULLY REPEATED THE LIST OF WINNERS HOWEVER HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE PRIZE QUERIED DOCTOR MC ALLISTER PUT IT IN THE SAVINGS BANK I GUESS REPLIED HENRY HAVE YOU AN ACCOUNT ASKED HIS FRIEND
AND WHEN HENRY FOUND HER SHE WAS JUST ROLLING THE CHARRED BALLS OUT ONTO THE FLAT STONES BURNED EM UP QUERIED HENRY BURNED NOTHING CRIED JESS ENERGETICALLY YOU JUST WAIT CAN'T WAIT HARDLY REPLIED HENRY SMILING
AND WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SEATED ON THE BLEACHERS AND THE STUNTS BEGAN HE FORGOT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD EXCEPT THE EXCITING EVENTS BEFORE HIS EYES HENRY HAD NO PENCIL BUT HE HAD AN EXCELLENT MEMORY
AND SO PLEASANT IN THE WOODS WITH THE LITTLE FLIES BUZZING ABOUT THAT BEFORE HE KNEW IT UNCLE WIGGILY HAD FALLEN ASLEEP HIS PINK NOSE STOPPED TWINKLING
AND HER BEAUTY UNTIL SOLOMON SIGHED A GREAT SIGH AND SAID IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE BUT WE SHALL SEE SO THE KING WROTE A LETTER TO BALKIS
THAT HE JUST HAD TO TORMENT CHATTERER BY LAUGHING AT HIM AND SAYING MEAN THINGS TO HIM UNTIL CHATTERER LOST HIS TEMPER AND SAID THINGS BACK QUITE IN THE OLD WAY THIS TICKLED SAMMY MORE THAN EVER
WHEN ALL WAS READY SOLOMON WAS WONT TO SEAT HIMSELF UPON HIS THRONE AND WOULD COMMAND THE WINDS TO DO THEIR DUTY
THE EAGLE SWOOPED DOWN AND WOULD HAVE SEIZED THE CULPRIT ROUGHLY IN HIS STRONG TALONS BUT THE HOOPOE BEGGED HIM FOR SOLOMON'S SAKE TO BE GENTLE FOR SOLOMON'S SAKE CRIED THE EAGLE DO YOU DARE TO NAME THE KING WHOM YOU HAVE INJURED
AND HOW GLAD ONE WOULD BE NOWADAYS TO HAVE SUCH KNOWLEDGE SOLOMON WAS ESPECIALLY FOND OF BIRDS AND LOVED TO TALK WITH THEM BECAUSE THEIR VOICES WERE SO SWEET AND THEY SPOKE SUCH BEAUTIFUL WORDS ONE DAY
BUT IF YOU HAVE NONE I'LL RUN HOME AND GET SOME MYSELF WILL YOU HOLD THE KITE WHILE I'M GONE TO BE SURE I WILL SAID UNCLE WIGGILY SO HE TOOK HOLD OF THE STRING OF TOMMIE'S KITE
REMEMBER KING THAT ONE DAY YOU ALSO MUST GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF YOUR SINS LET ME NOT THEREFORE BE CONDEMNED UNHEARD AND IF I HEAR YOU WHAT EXCUSE CAN YOU HAVE TO OFFER ANSWERED SOLOMON FROWNING
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY FEELING HIMSELF BEING PULLED AT FIRST
BUT OF ALL THE WINGED SINGERS WHO SPOKE THAT DAY IN THE GARDEN THE WISE KING CHOSE TO HAVE EVER NEAR HIM THE COCK BECAUSE HE HAD SPOKEN WORDS OF PIETY AND THE NIMBLE HOOPOE BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO PLUNGE HIS CLEAR GAZE
CRIED UNCLE WIGGILY I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT BUT I'LL GO WHAT WAS IT YOU WANTED OF ME HE ASKED TOMMIE KAT WHO WAS MAKING A FISHPOLE OF HIS TAIL BY STANDING IT STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR
OUT OF SIGHT JUST AS QUICKLY IT LOOKS TO ME VERY MUCH AS IF PETER RABBIT IS OVER THERE AND FEELING VERY NERVOUS SAID CHATTERER TO HIMSELF AND THEN HE CALLED SHARPLY JUST AS WHEN
FOR IT SOUNDED SO EXACTLY LIKE CHATTERER WHEN HE HAD BEEN A FREE LITTLE IMP OF MISCHIEF IN THE GREEN FOREST THAT SAMMY FELT SURE THAT CHATTERER HAD NOTHING THE MATTER WITH HIM
BUT THIS WAS HIS FAVORITE BIRD AND HE HOPED THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME REASON FOR SPARING HIM WELL SAID THE HOOPOE AT MECCA I MET A HOOPOE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO TOLD ME SO WONDERFUL A TALE OF THE MARVELOUS KINGDOM OF SHEBA
COLORED A BEAUTIFUL REDDISH GRAY WITH FEATHERS OF PURPLE BROWN AND WHITE AND HIS BLACK WINGS ARE BANDED WITH WHITE BUT THE PECULIAR THING ABOUT A HOOPOE IS HIS CROWN OF TAWNY FEATHERS A TALL CROWN FOR SO SMALL A BIRD
EACH OF US A GOLDEN CROWN ON HIS HEAD KING SOLOMON SMILED AND ANSWERED CROWNS OF GOLD SHALL YOU HAVE BUT YOU ARE FOOLISH BIRDS MY HOOPOES AND WHEN THE EVIL DAYS SHALL COME UPON YOU AND YOU SEE THE FOLLY OF YOUR DESIRE
AND THEN BECAUSE IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT AND HE REALLY DIDN'T DARE STAY ANOTHER MINUTE PETER WAVED GOOD BY TO CHATTERER AND STARTED FOR THE GREEN FOREST AS FAST AS HIS LONG LEGS COULD TAKE HIM
HE PUT A PIECE OF BROKEN MIRROR INTO HIS TRAP AND A HOOPOE SPYING IT WENT IN TO ADMIRE HERSELF AND WAS CAUGHT THE FOWLER LOOKED AT THE SHINING CROWN UPON HER HEAD AND SAID WHAT HAVE WE HERE
SAMMY FAIRLY ACHED ALL OVER TO SPREAD THE NEWS THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST AND OVER THE GREEN MEADOWS YOU KNOW HE IS A GREAT GOSSIP AND THIS WAS SUCH UNUSUAL NEWS SAMMY KNEW VERY WELL THAT NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE HIM
TOMMIE RAN HOLDING THE STRING THAT WAS FAST TO THE KITE AND UP AND UP AND UP IT WENT IN THE AIR SOON IT WAS SAILING QUITE NEAR THE CLOUDS
MORE GLORIOUS THAN GOLD MORE PRECIOUS THAN RARE JEWELS I SAW QUEEN BALKIS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF QUEENS TELL ME OF THIS QUEEN SAID SOLOMON LOOSENING HIS ROUGH GRASP UPON THE HOOPOE
EVERY ONE TURNED FOWLER AND BEGAN TO HUNT THE PRECIOUS BIRDS
WHICH WAS NOW QUITE HIGH IN THE AIR AND SITTING DOWN ON THE GROUND UNCLE WIGGILY HELD THE KITE FROM RUNNING AWAY WHILE TOMMIE WENT FOR MORE STRING IT WAS A NICE WARM SUMMER DAY
LOOKING AT THE KITE STRING WHICH WAS PULLING AT THE STUMP VERY HARD NOW BUT BEFORE YOU TAKE ME AWAY WOULD YOU MIND PULLING DOWN TOMMIE'S KITE ASKED THE BUNNY UNCLE I'LL LEAVE IT FOR HIM YES
DURING THE JOURNEY ABOVE THE AERIAL CARAVAN FLUTTERED A CLOUD OF BIRDS
I WANT THE ONE ABOUT THE DINNER BELL IS RINGING IN THE BREAD BOX THIS FINE DAY AND THE DINNER BELL IS RINGING FOR TO TAKE YOU FAR AWAY UNCLE WIGGILY AH THEN I HAD BETTER GO TO MY DINNER
THE CYNICAL OLD CROW CROAKED DISAGREEABLY THE FURTHER AWAY FROM MEN I AM THE BETTER I AM PLEASED LAST OF ALL THE COCK WHO SINGS IN THE MORNING CHANTED HIS JOYOUS SONG THINK OF YOUR CREATOR
AND AFTER THAT IS DONE
AND THEN HE AND UNCLE WIGGILY WENT TO A CLEAR OPEN PLACE IN THE FIELDS NEAR THE WOODS TO FLY IT THERE WAS A GOOD WIND BLOWING
SO IT WAS SAY THE MUSSULMANS THAT A BIRD TOLD SOLOMON OF THE GREAT QUEEN WHOSE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM IS DESCRIBED IN THE BIBLE
ANXIOUSLY THE EAGLE CALLED THE ROLL OF ALL THE BIRDS IN HIS COMPANY AND HE WAS HORRIFIED TO FIND THAT IT WAS SOLOMON'S FAVORITE THE HOOPOE WHO WAS MISSING WITH TERROR HE ANNOUNCED THE BIRD'S DESERTION TO THE MOST WISE KING
IT MADE CHATTERER ANGRY JUST TO SEE HIM SMARTY SMARTY MISTER SMARTY GLAD TO SEE YOU LOOKING HEARTY WEATHER'S FINE AS YOU CAN SEE WON'T YOU TAKE A WALK WITH ME SO SAID REDDY FOX
OR THE BAD FOX TRYING TO DRAG HIM OFF TO HIS DEN AND UNCLE WIGGILY OPENING HIS EYES CRIED HERE STOP THAT IF YOU PLEASE DON'T PULL ME SO BUT WHEN HE LOOKED AROUND HE COULD SEE NO ONE
THE WISE KING WAS CHATTING PLEASANTLY WITH THE BIRDS WHO LIVED IN HIS WONDERFUL GARDEN AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH HE HEARD THEM SAY THE NIGHTINGALE THE SWEETEST SINGER OF ALL CHANTED
DIDN'T YOU PROMISE TO GO TO THE FIVE AND TEN CENT STORE FOR ME AND BUY ME A PAIR OF DIAMOND EARRINGS ASKED NURSE JANE FUZZY WUZZY THE MUSKRAT LADY HOUSEKEEPER OH SO I DID
THAT WILL BE FUN CRIED TOMMIE
OFF TO MY DEN YOU SHALL GO YOU SHALL GO YOU SHALL GO OFF TO MY DEN OH HOLD ON CRIED THE BAD CREATURE THAT ISN'T THE SONG I WANTED TO SING THAT'S THE LONDON BRIDGE SONG
OH I WANTED YOU TO COME AND HELP ME BUILD A KITE AND THEN COME WITH ME AND FLY IT SAID THE KITTEN BOY
WELL PERHAPS I COULD SAID THE BUNNY UNCLE I WILL FIRST GO TO THE STORE AND GET NURSE JANE'S DIAMOND EARRINGS THEN ON THE WAY BACK I'LL STOP AND HELP YOU WITH YOUR KITE
ONLY OF COURSE NO ONE RODE ON THE KITE HAVE YOU ANY MORE STRING UNCLE WIGGILY ASKED THE KITTEN BOY AFTER A BIT STRING TOMMIE WHAT FOR
OF COURSE HE WAS PULLED ALMOST OFF HIS FEET HA THAT KITE IS A GREAT PULLER SAID THE BUNNY UNCLE I MUST LOOK OUT OR IT MIGHT PULL ME UP TO THE CLOUDS I HAD BETTER FASTEN THE STRING TO THIS OLD STUMP
UNCLE WIGGILY HAVE YOU ANYTHING SPECIAL TO DO TODAY ASKED TOMMIE KAT THE LITTLE KITTEN BOY ONE MORNING AS HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR OF THE HOLLOW STUMP BUNGALOW WHERE MISTER LONGEARS THE RABBIT GENTLEMAN LIVED
INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH AS IF IT WERE MADE OF TRANSPARENT GLASS AND DISCOVER THE PLACES WHERE SPRINGS OF LIVING WATER WERE HIDDEN UNDER THE SOIL IT WAS VERY CONVENIENT FOR SOLOMON WHEN HE WAS TRAVELING TO HAVE SOME ONE WITH HIM
THE EAGLE LED HIM TO THE KING WHO WITH A WRATHFUL FACE WAS SITTING ON HIS THRONE THE HOOPOE TREMBLED AND DROOPED HIS FEATHERS HUMBLY BUT WHEN SOLOMON WOULD HAVE CRUSHED HIM IN HIS MIGHTY FIST THE BIRD CRIED
KING SOLOMON AND THE BIRDS KING SOLOMON WAS WISER THAN ALL MEN AND HIS FAME WAS IN ALL NATIONS ROUND ABOUT JERUSALEM HE WAS SO WISE THAT HE KNEW EVERY SPOKEN LANGUAGE YES
THE BUNNY UNCLE AND THE LITTLE KITTEN BOY CUT OUT SOME RED PAPER IN THE SHAPE OF A KITE THEN THEY PASTED IT ON THE CROSSED STICKS WHICH WERE TIED TOGETHER WITH STRING THE KITE IS ALMOST DONE SAID UNCLE WIGGILY
AND THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR
IT SEEMED THAT SOON THERE WOULD BE NO MORE HOOPOES LEFT TO BEWAIL THEIR SAD FATE AT LAST THE FEW WHO STILL LIVED GATHERED TOGETHER AND HELD A MEETING TO CONSIDER WHAT SHOULD BE DONE FOR THEIR MINDS WERE FILLED WITH SORROW AND DISMAY
WHO WANTED TO WEAR THEM TO A PARTY MISSUS CLUCK CLUCK THE HEN LADY WAS GOING TO HAVE NEXT WEEK AND NOW TO MAKE THE KITE CRIED TOMMIE AS HE AND UNCLE WIGGILY REACHED THE HOUSE WHERE THE KAT FAMILY LIVED
ANYTHING SPECIAL TO DO WHY NO I GUESS NOT ANSWERED THE BUNNY UNCLE I JUST HAVE TO GO WALKING TO LOOK FOR AN ADVENTURE TO HAPPEN TO ME AND THEN
RIGHT AWAY PETER'S HEAD BOBBED UP FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A JACK IN THE BOX AND THIS TIME IT STAYED UP PETER'S EYES WERE ROUND WITH SURPRISE AS HE STARED ACROSS AT CHATTERER'S PRISON
AND THEN HE KNEW IT WAS TOMMIE'S KITE FLYING UP IN THE AIR THAT WAS DOING THE PULLING THE WIND WAS BLOWING HARD NOW AND AS UNCLE WIGGILY HAD THE KITE STRING WOUND AROUND HIS PAWS
SAMMY WAS SO RELIEVED TO THINK THAT CHATTERER WAS NOT DEAD AND HE WAS SO TICKLED TO THINK THAT CHATTERER WHO ALWAYS THOUGHT HIMSELF SO SMART SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT
IN ARABIA THAT I COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO VISIT THAT COUNTRY OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES AND THERE INDEED I SAW THE MOST PRODIGIOUS TREASURES BUT BEST OF ALL O KING
THEY GREW VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY THEY WENT DOWN BY THE LAKES AND POOLS
UNCLE WIGGILY WAS JUST GOING TO SLEEP AGAIN AND HE WAS WONDERING WHY IT TOOK TOMMIE SO LONG TO FIND MORE STRING FOR THE KITE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS A RUSTLING IN THE BUSHES AND OUT JUMPED THE BAD OLD BABBOON
OF SILVER OF WOOD FOR THE MULTITUDE OF PERSONS OF DIFFERENT RANK WHOM HE TOOK WITH HIM THERE WAS ALSO NO LACK OF THE MOST GORGEOUS FURNITURE
PAPER STICKS PASTE AND STRING WE'LL MAKE A BIG ONE AND FLY IT AWAY UP IN THE AIR
TAKE THIS LETTER TO QUEEN BALKIS THEN COME AWAY THE HOOPOE DID AS HE WAS BID DARTING OFF TOWARDS THE SOUTH LIKE AN ARROW AND THE NEXT DAY HE CAME TO THE PALACE OF THE QUEEN OF SHEBA WHERE SHE SAT
UNTIL THE EARTH BENEATH HIM LOOKED LIKE A BOWL TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
HE HAS DISCOVERED YOUR ABSENCE AND IN HIS RIGHTEOUS ANGER WILL PUNISH YOU SEVERELY LEAD ME TO HIM REPLIED THE HOOPOE I KNOW THAT HE WILL FORGIVE ME WHEN HE HEARS WHERE I HAVE BEEN AND WHAT I HAVE TO TELL HIM
WHO HAD ONCE BEFORE MADE TROUBLE FOR THE BUNNY UNCLE
A TALENT WAS WORTH THREE HUNDRED SHEKELS
AND WHEN SHE HAD READ THE BRIEF INVITATION SHE STARED AND STARED AGAIN BUT SHE HAD HEARD THE FAME OF SOLOMON AND WAS EAGER TO ASK HIM
I NEVER SAW A CROWN LIKE THIS UPON ANY BIRD I MUST ASK ABOUT THIS
O FOOLISH CREATURES WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED TALKING KING SOLOMON SOFTLY STROKED THE HEAD OF THE PRETTY LITTLE DOVE
KNOWING ALL THE TIME THAT CHATTERER COULDN'T TAKE A WALK WITH ANY ONE
YOU SEE REDDY KNEW THAT FARMER BROWN'S BOY
RETURN HERE TO ME AND I WILL HELP YOU YET AGAIN SO THE KING OF THE HOOPOES LEFT KING SOLOMON WITH A BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN CROWN UPON HIS HEAD AND SOON ALL THE HOOPOES WERE WEARING GOLDEN CROWNS THEREUPON
IN FACT HE DIDN'T HALF HEAR THE MEAN THINGS REDDY FOX SAID TO HIM YOU SEE IT WAS COMING OVER HIM MORE AND MORE THAT NOTHING COULD TAKE THE PLACE OF FREEDOM HE HAD A COMFORTABLE HOME PLENTY TO EAT
AS HE HELD IT UP AND CAN YOU TELL ME TOMMIE WHY YOUR KITE IS LIKE BUDDY THE GUINEA PIG BOY CAN I TELL YOU WHY MY KITE IS LIKE BUDDY THE GUINEA PIG BOY REPEATED TOMMIE LIKE A MAN IN A MINSTREL SHOW
BE SURE TO TELL NO OTHER MAN OF THE MATTER A SHEKEL WAS ABOUT SIXTY TWO CENTS AFTER THIS THE FOWLER CAUGHT MANY HOOPOES IN THE SAME WAY AND SOLD THEIR CROWNS TO ISSACHAR
IN HEAVY WAGONS OR CLUMSY BOATS BY DUSTY ROADS OR STORMY WAVES IT WAS IN NO SUCH TROUBLOUS WAYS THAT SOLOMON THE ALL POWERFUL TRAVERSED SPACE AND REACHED THE UTTERMOST CORNERS OF THE EARTH THANKS TO HIS GREAT KNOWLEDGE
THIS TIME I HAVE CAUGHT YOU YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM ME NOW I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU OFF TO MY DEN OH PLEASE DON'T BEGGED UNCLE WIGGILY YES I SHALL TOO BLABBERED THE BABBOON
FOR LIFE WAS NOT SO DREADFUL A THING AFTER ALL AND HE GAVE HER PERMISSION TO BUILD HER NEST UNDER THE WALLS OF THE GREAT TEMPLE WHICH HE WAS BUILDING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HOUSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD
BUT MORE THAN THIS HE COULD TALK WITH EVERYTHING THAT LIVED TREES AND FLOWERS BEASTS AND FOWLS CREEPING THINGS AND FISHES WHAT A VERY PLEASANT THING THAT WAS FOR SOLOMON TO BE SURE
BUT NOW THAT THERE MAY BE A MEMORIAL OF THE SERVICE WHICH ONCE YOU DID ME YOUR CROWNS OF GOLD SHALL BE CHANGED INTO CROWNS OF FEATHERS AND WITH THEM YOU MAY WALK UNHARMED UPON THE EARTH
SOME YEARS AFTERWARD THE DOVES HAD SO INCREASED IN NUMBERS THAT WITH THEIR EXTENDED WINGS THEY FORMED A VEIL OVER THE NUMBERLESS PILGRIMS WHO CAME TO JERUSALEM TO VISIT THE WONDERFUL TEMPLE
BUT HE COULDN'T STOP VERY LONG TO MAKE FUN OF POOR CHATTERER IN THE FIRST PLACE FARMER BROWN'S BOY HAD PUT HIS HEAD OUT THE BARN DOOR TO SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS WAS ABOUT IN THE SECOND PLACE
CONTENTMENT IS THE GREATEST HAPPINESS IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MOST PEOPLE NEVER TO HAVE BEEN BORN CROONED THE MELANCHOLY TURTLE DOVE THE HAPPY LITTLE SWALLOW GAVE HER OPINION DO GOOD
CHATTERER SAW SOMETHING VERY FAMILIAR BEHIND THE OLD STONE WALL AT THE EDGE OF THE OLD ORCHARD IT BOBBED UP AND THEN DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT AGAIN THEN IT BOBBED UP AGAIN ONLY TO DROP
