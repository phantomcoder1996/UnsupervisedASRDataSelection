DARK LANK HAIR AND STRONG FEATURES SO MUCH FOR HER PERSON AND NOT LESS UNPROPITIOUS FOR HEROISM SEEMED HER MIND SHE WAS FOND OF ALL BOY'S PLAYS AND GREATLY PREFERRED CRICKET
COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REJECTION BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
HAD SEEN WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SUDDENNESS CONTINUANCE AND EXTENT OF HIS ATTENTION AND THOUGH LATTERLY FROM SOME HINTS WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED AN ALMOST POSITIVE COMMAND TO HIS SON OF DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO ATTACH HER
HER INTIMACY THERE HAD MADE HIM SERIOUSLY DETERMINE ON HER BEING HANDSOMELY LEGACIED HEREAFTER AND TO SPEAK OF HER THEREFORE AS THE ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGED FUTURE HEIRESS OF FULLERTON NATURALLY FOLLOWED
JOHN THORPE HAD FIRST MISLED HIM THE GENERAL PERCEIVING HIS SON ONE NIGHT AT THE THEATRE TO BE PAYING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO MISS MORLAND
CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS APPEARANCE THERE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED HE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO EXPECT A WELCOME AT FULLERTON AND STATING HIS IMPATIENCE TO BE ASSURED OF MISS MORLAND'S HAVING REACHED HER HOME IN SAFETY
AND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD EVEN WALK ABOUT THE HOUSE RATHER THAN REMAIN FIXED FOR ANY TIME IN THE PARLOUR HER LOSS OF SPIRITS WAS A YET GREATER ALTERATION IN HER RAMBLING AND HER IDLENESS
BUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY MISTER ALLEN
CATHERINE AT ANY RATE HEARD ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT IN SUSPECTING GENERAL TILNEY OF EITHER MURDERING OR SHUTTING UP HIS WIFE SHE HAD SCARCELY SINNED AGAINST HIS CHARACTER OR MAGNIFIED HIS CRUELTY
AND ON DEVELOPING FROM AMIDST ALL HER PERPLEXITY OF WORDS IN REPLY THE MEANING WHICH ONE SHORT SYLLABLE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO THEM AND
SOME EXPLANATION ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT HE HAD TO GIVE BUT HIS FIRST PURPOSE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND BEFORE THEY REACHED MISTER ALLEN'S GROUNDS HE HAD DONE IT SO WELL THAT CATHERINE DID NOT THINK IT COULD EVER BE REPEATED TOO OFTEN
UPON SUCH INTELLIGENCE THE GENERAL HAD PROCEEDED FOR NEVER HAD IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO DOUBT ITS AUTHORITY THORPE'S INTEREST IN THE FAMILY BY HIS SISTER'S APPROACHING CONNECTION WITH ONE OF ITS MEMBERS
HENRY IN HAVING SUCH THINGS TO RELATE OF HIS FATHER WAS ALMOST AS PITIABLE AS IN THEIR FIRST AVOWAL TO HIMSELF HE BLUSHED FOR THE NARROW MINDED COUNSEL WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO EXPOSE
THAT THEY WERE FALSE THE GENERAL HAD LEARNT FROM THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD SUGGESTED THEM FROM THORPE HIMSELF WHOM HE HAD CHANCED TO MEET AGAIN IN TOWN AND WHO UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXACTLY OPPOSITE FEELINGS
BUT HER GLOWING CHEEK AND BRIGHTENED EYE MADE HER MOTHER TRUST THAT THIS GOOD NATURED VISIT WOULD AT LEAST SET HER HEART AT EASE FOR A TIME AND GLADLY THEREFORE DID SHE LAY ASIDE THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE MIRROR FOR A FUTURE HOUR
HATED CONFINEMENT AND CLEANLINESS AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN AT FIFTEEN APPEARANCES WERE MENDING
SUCH WAS THE PERMISSION UPON WHICH HE HAD NOW OFFERED HER HIS HAND THE AFFRIGHTED CATHERINE AMIDST ALL THE TERRORS OF EXPECTATION AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS ACCOUNT
SHE KNEW NOT THAT A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES TILL ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST OBJECT SHE BEHELD WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
SHE HAD NEVER ANY OBJECTION TO BOOKS AT ALL BUT FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SHE WAS IN TRAINING FOR A HEROINE SHE READ ALL SUCH WORKS AS HEROINES MUST READ TO SUPPLY THEIR MEMORIES WITH THOSE QUOTATIONS WHICH ARE SO SERVICEABLE
BEEN CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF GIVING THE YOUNG PEOPLE EVEN A DECENT SUPPORT THEY WERE IN FACT A NECESSITOUS FAMILY NUMEROUS TOO ALMOST BEYOND EXAMPLE BY NO MEANS RESPECTED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW HIM THE WAY YOU MAY SEE THE HOUSE FROM THIS WINDOW SIR WAS INFORMATION ON SARAH'S SIDE WHICH PRODUCED ONLY A BOW OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE GENTLEMAN AND A SILENCING NOD FROM HER MOTHER
MISSUS MORLAND HAD BEEN ALWAYS KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS EACH AND INSTANTLY PLEASED BY HIS APPEARANCE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE SIMPLE PROFESSIONS OF UNAFFECTED BENEVOLENCE THANKING HIM FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION TO HER DAUGHTER
WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER AS MISTER HENRY TILNEY WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY
DESIROUS OF MISTER MORLAND'S ASSISTANCE AS WELL IN GIVING ENCOURAGEMENT AS IN FINDING CONVERSATION FOR HER GUEST WHOSE EMBARRASSMENT ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT SHE EARNESTLY PITIED
CHAPTER THIRTY CATHERINE'S DISPOSITION WAS NOT NATURALLY SEDENTARY NOR HAD HER HABITS BEEN EVER VERY INDUSTRIOUS BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HITHERTO HAVE BEEN HER DEFECTS OF THAT SORT
HER ABILITIES WERE QUITE AS EXTRAORDINARY SHE NEVER COULD LEARN OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BEFORE SHE WAS TAUGHT AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THEN FOR SHE WAS OFTEN INATTENTIVE AND OCCASIONALLY STUPID
ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOILT FOR HOME BY GREAT ACQUAINTANCE THE MIRROR I THINK I WILL LOOK IT OUT FOR YOU SOME DAY OR OTHER BECAUSE I AM SURE IT WILL DO YOU GOOD CATHERINE SAID NO MORE AND WITH AN ENDEAVOUR TO DO RIGHT
LIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT SMILING AT GRIEF SO FAR HER IMPROVEMENT WAS SUFFICIENT AND IN MANY OTHER POINTS SHE CAME ON EXCEEDINGLY WELL FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT WRITE SONNETS
AND HE KNEW THE YOUNG MAN ON WHOM THE FULLERTON ESTATE MUST DEVOLVE THE GENERAL NEEDED NO MORE ENRAGED WITH ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD BUT HIMSELF HE SET OUT THE NEXT DAY FOR THE ABBEY WHERE HIS PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN SEEN
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED ERE SHE RETURNED DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE VOLUME FROM WHICH SO MUCH WAS HOPED HER AVOCATIONS ABOVE HAVING SHUT OUT ALL NOISE BUT WHAT SHE CREATED HERSELF
FOR AFTER COMING EAGERLY FORWARD ON THE FIRST OVERTURE OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WITH THE MOST LIBERAL PROPOSALS HE HAD ON BEING BROUGHT TO THE POINT BY THE SHREWDNESS OF THE RELATOR
HER GREATEST DEFICIENCY WAS IN THE PENCIL SHE HAD NO NOTION OF DRAWING NOT ENOUGH EVEN TO ATTEMPT A SKETCH OF HER LOVER'S PROFILE THAT SHE MIGHT BE DETECTED IN THE DESIGN
THOUGH HIS HEART WAS GREATLY RELIEVED BY SUCH UNLOOKED FOR MILDNESS IT WAS NOT JUST AT THAT MOMENT IN HIS POWER TO SAY ANYTHING TO THE PURPOSE RETURNING IN SILENCE TO HIS SEAT THEREFORE
SO AT EIGHT YEARS OLD SHE BEGAN SHE LEARNT A YEAR AND COULD NOT BEAR IT AND MISSUS MORLAND WHO DID NOT INSIST ON HER DAUGHTERS BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN SPITE OF INCAPACITY OR DISTASTE ALLOWED HER TO LEAVE OFF
THERE SHE FELL MISERABLY SHORT OF THE TRUE HEROIC HEIGHT AT PRESENT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER OWN POVERTY FOR SHE HAD NO LOVER TO PORTRAY SHE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN
THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM AT NORTHANGER HAD BEEN OF THE MOST UNFRIENDLY KIND HENRY'S INDIGNATION ON HEARING HOW CATHERINE HAD BEEN TREATED ON COMPREHENDING HIS FATHER'S VIEWS AND BEING ORDERED TO ACQUIESCE IN THEM
HIS VANITY INDUCED HIM TO REPRESENT THE FAMILY AS YET MORE WEALTHY THAN HIS VANITY AND AVARICE HAD MADE HIM BELIEVE THEM WITH WHOMSOEVER HE WAS OR WAS LIKELY TO BE CONNECTED
THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACK
AND FROM SHAKESPEARE SHE GAINED A GREAT STORE OF INFORMATION AMONGST THE REST THAT TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR ARE TO THE JEALOUS CONFIRMATION STRONG AS PROOFS OF HOLY WRIT
HER LOVE OF DIRT GAVE WAY TO AN INCLINATION FOR FINERY AND SHE GREW CLEAN AS SHE GREW SMART SHE HAD NOW THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES HEARING HER FATHER AND MOTHER REMARK ON HER PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT
FRENCH BY HER MOTHER HER PROFICIENCY IN EITHER WAS NOT REMARKABLE AND SHE SHIRKED HER LESSONS IN BOTH WHENEVER SHE COULD WHAT A STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE CHARACTER FOR WITH ALL THESE SYMPTOMS OF PROFLIGACY AT TEN YEARS OLD
APPLIED TO HER WORK BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES SUNK AGAIN WITHOUT KNOWING IT HERSELF INTO LANGUOR AND LISTLESSNESS MOVING HERSELF IN HER CHAIR FROM THE IRRITATION OF WEARINESS MUCH OFTENER THAN SHE MOVED HER NEEDLE
THIS WAS STRANGE INDEED BUT STRANGE THINGS MAY BE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR IF THEIR CAUSE BE FAIRLY SEARCHED OUT THERE WAS NOT ONE LORD IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NO NOT EVEN A BARONET
HENRY WAS CONVINCED OF HIS FATHER'S BELIEVING IT TO BE AN ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION IT WAS NOT TILL THE LATE EXPLANATION AT NORTHANGER THAT THEY HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF THE FALSE CALCULATIONS WHICH HAD HURRIED HIM ON
SHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEM
THAN A BEAUTY FROM HER CRADLE CAN EVER RECEIVE MISSUS MORLAND WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN AND WISHED TO SEE HER CHILDREN EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE BUT HER TIME WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED IN LYING IN AND TEACHING THE LITTLE ONES
SCARCELY OPENED HER LIPS DISMISSED THEM TO THE ECSTASIES OF ANOTHER TETE A TETE AND BEFORE IT WAS SUFFERED TO CLOSE SHE WAS ENABLED TO JUDGE HOW FAR HE WAS SANCTIONED BY PARENTAL AUTHORITY IN HIS PRESENT APPLICATION
BUT WHEN A THIRD NIGHT'S REST HAD NEITHER RESTORED HER CHEERFULNESS IMPROVED HER IN USEFUL ACTIVITY NOR GIVEN HER A GREATER INCLINATION FOR NEEDLEWORK SHE COULD NO LONGER REFRAIN FROM THE GENTLE REPROOF OF
HAD ACCIDENTALLY INQUIRED OF THORPE IF HE KNEW MORE OF HER THAN HER NAME THORPE MOST HAPPY TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A MAN OF GENERAL TILNEY'S IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN JOYFULLY AND PROUDLY COMMUNICATIVE
WHO OWNED THE CHIEF OF THE PROPERTY ABOUT FULLERTON THE VILLAGE IN WILTSHIRE WHERE THE MORLANDS LIVED WAS ORDERED TO BATH FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GOUTY CONSTITUTION AND HIS LADY A GOOD HUMOURED WOMAN FOND OF MISS MORLAND AND PROBABLY AWARE THAT IF
SHE BROUGHT HERSELF TO READ THEM AND THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF HER THROWING A WHOLE PARTY INTO RAPTURES BY A PRELUDE ON THE PIANOFORTE OF HER OWN COMPOSITION SHE COULD LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE WITH VERY LITTLE FATIGUE
AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES UNBROKEN SILENCE HENRY TURNING TO CATHERINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HER MOTHER'S ENTRANCE ASKED HER WITH SUDDEN ALACRITY IF MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN WERE NOW AT FULLERTON
AND SPURNING A FRIENDSHIP WHICH COULD BE NO LONGER SERVICEABLE HASTENED TO CONTRADICT ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MORLANDS CONFESSED HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN TOTALLY MISTAKEN IN HIS OPINION OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND CHARACTER
THAT WOULD BE TURNING YOUR VISIT INTO AN EVIL INDEED WHEREVER YOU ARE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONTENTED BUT ESPECIALLY AT HOME BECAUSE THERE YOU MUST SPEND THE MOST OF YOUR TIME I DID NOT QUITE LIKE AT BREAKFAST
IRRITATED BY CATHERINE'S REFUSAL AND YET MORE BY THE FAILURE OF A VERY RECENT ENDEAVOUR TO ACCOMPLISH A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN MORLAND AND ISABELLA CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOREVER
WHICH IT MUST BE MORE PLEASANT FOR HIM TO COMMUNICATE ONLY TO CATHERINE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PREVENT HER ACCOMPANYING HIM THEY BEGAN THEIR WALK AND MISSUS MORLAND WAS NOT ENTIRELY MISTAKEN IN HIS OBJECT IN WISHING IT
HER MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF USEFUL PLAIN SENSE WITH A GOOD TEMPER AND WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE WITH A GOOD CONSTITUTION SHE HAD THREE SONS BEFORE CATHERINE WAS BORN
THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY WHO WAS SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND
THAT THE POOR BEETLE WHICH WE TREAD UPON IN CORPORAL SUFFERANCE FEELS A PANG AS GREAT AS WHEN A GIANT DIES AND THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IN LOVE ALWAYS LOOKS
I LEAVE IT TO MY READER'S SAGACITY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF ALL THIS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HENRY TO COMMUNICATE AT THIS TIME TO CATHERINE HOW MUCH OF IT HE COULD HAVE LEARNT FROM HIS FATHER
THE CREDIT OF A WILD IMAGINATION WILL AT LEAST BE ALL MY OWN A VERY SHORT VISIT TO MISSUS ALLEN IN WHICH HENRY TALKED AT RANDOM WITHOUT SENSE OR CONNECTION AND CATHERINE
NO OPPOSING DESIRE THAT SHOULD DARE TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN WORDS COULD ILL BROOK THE OPPOSITION OF HIS SON STEADY AS THE SANCTION OF REASON AND THE DICTATE OF CONSCIENCE COULD MAKE IT BUT IN SUCH A CAUSE HIS ANGER
CATHERINE TOOK UP HER WORK DIRECTLY SAYING IN A DEJECTED VOICE THAT HER HEAD DID NOT RUN UPON BATH MUCH THEN YOU ARE FRETTING ABOUT GENERAL TILNEY AND THAT IS VERY SIMPLE OF YOU
MISLED BY THE RHODOMONTADE OF HIS FRIEND TO BELIEVE HIS FATHER A MAN OF SUBSTANCE AND CREDIT WHEREAS THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE TWO OR THREE LAST WEEKS PROVED HIM TO BE NEITHER
AND DESIGNED HER FOR HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ON DISCOVERING HIS ERROR TO TURN HER FROM THE HOUSE SEEMED THE BEST THOUGH TO HIS FEELINGS AN INADEQUATE PROOF OF HIS RESENTMENT TOWARDS HERSELF AND HIS CONTEMPT OF HER FAMILY
HAD BEEN THE ONLY CAUSE OF GIVING HER A SERIOUS THOUGHT IT IS A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE IN ROMANCE I ACKNOWLEDGE AND DREADFULLY DEROGATORY OF AN HEROINE'S DIGNITY BUT IF IT BE AS NEW IN COMMON LIFE
HIS OWN CONSEQUENCE ALWAYS REQUIRED THAT THEIRS SHOULD BE GREAT AND AS HIS INTIMACY WITH ANY ACQUAINTANCE GREW SO REGULARLY GREW THEIR FORTUNE THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS FRIEND MORLAND THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST OVERRATED
MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR FROM THOMPSON THAT IT IS A DELIGHTFUL TASK TO TEACH THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOT
MY DEAR CATHERINE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GROWING QUITE A FINE LADY I DO NOT KNOW WHEN POOR RICHARD'S CRAVATS WOULD BE DONE IF HE HAD NO FRIEND BUT YOU YOUR HEAD RUNS TOO MUCH UPON BATH
IN WHAT POINTS HIS OWN CONJECTURES MIGHT ASSIST HIM AND WHAT PORTION MUST YET REMAIN TO BE TOLD IN A LETTER FROM JAMES
SHE HAD A THIN AWKWARD FIGURE
AND RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO BOOKS OR AT LEAST BOOKS OF INFORMATION FOR PROVIDED THAT NOTHING LIKE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE COULD BE GAINED FROM THEM PROVIDED THEY WERE ALL STORY AND NO REFLECTION
THE TERRIFIED GENERAL PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF ALLEN WITH AN INQUIRING LOOK AND HERE TOO THORPE HAD LEARNT HIS ERROR THE ALLENS HE BELIEVED HAD LIVED NEAR THEM TOO LONG
HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER
SHE LEARNT THE FABLE OF THE HARE AND MANY FRIENDS AS QUICKLY AS ANY GIRL IN ENGLAND HER MOTHER WISHED HER TO LEARN MUSIC AND CATHERINE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD LIKE IT FOR SHE WAS VERY FOND OF TINKLING THE KEYS OF THE OLD FORLORN SPINNET
AND THANKFUL FOR MISTER THORPE'S COMMUNICATION HE ALMOST INSTANTLY DETERMINED TO SPARE NO PAINS IN WEAKENING HIS BOASTED INTEREST AND RUINING HIS DEAREST HOPES
BESTOWING A RICH AUNT AND SINKING HALF THE CHILDREN HE WAS ABLE TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE FAMILY TO THE GENERAL IN A MOST RESPECTABLE LIGHT FOR CATHERINE HOWEVER THE PECULIAR OBJECT OF THE GENERAL'S CURIOSITY
AND BELIEVING THAT HEART TO BE HIS OWN WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO GAIN NO UNWORTHY RETRACTION OF A TACIT CONSENT
FOR MISSUS MORLAND THINKING IT PROBABLE AS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IN HIS WISH OF WAITING ON THEIR WORTHY NEIGHBOURS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO GIVE OF HIS FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR
THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS IN HIS ANGER AND THEY PARTED IN DREADFUL DISAGREEMENT HENRY IN AN AGITATION OF MIND WHICH MANY SOLITARY HOURS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPOSE
THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER HER OWN PERSON AND DISPOSITION WERE ALL EQUALLY AGAINST HER HER FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN WITHOUT BEING NEGLECTED OR POOR AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN
NORTHANGER ABBEY
MISSUS MORLAND HAD VERY EARLY DISPATCHED ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO SUMMON HIM BUT MISTER MORLAND WAS FROM HOME AND BEING THUS WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
AND BEING AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN DAILY EXPECTATION OF MORLAND'S ENGAGING ISABELLA BUT LIKEWISE PRETTY WELL RESOLVED UPON MARRYING CATHERINE HIMSELF
HAD EVER SINCE HIS INTRODUCTION TO ISABELLA BEEN GRADUALLY INCREASING AND BY MERELY ADDING TWICE AS MUCH FOR THE GRANDEUR OF THE MOMENT BY DOUBLING WHAT HE CHOSE TO THINK THE AMOUNT OF MISTER MORLAND'S PREFERMENT TREBLING HIS PRIVATE FORTUNE
HER MOTHER WAS THREE MONTHS IN TEACHING HER ONLY TO REPEAT THE BEGGAR'S PETITION AND AFTER ALL HER NEXT SISTER SALLY COULD SAY IT BETTER THAN SHE DID NOT THAT CATHERINE WAS ALWAYS STUPID BY NO MEANS
NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE
TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT NORTHANGER I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT I EAT THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH SUCH A SUBJECT
SHE BEGAN TO CURL HER HAIR AND LONG FOR BALLS HER COMPLEXION IMPROVED HER FEATURES WERE SOFTENED BY PLUMPNESS AND COLOUR HER EYES GAINED MORE ANIMATION AND HER FIGURE MORE CONSEQUENCE
AND DELIGHTED IN ALL THE EXCELLENCIES OF HER CHARACTER AND TRULY LOVED HER SOCIETY I MUST CONFESS THAT HIS AFFECTION ORIGINATED IN NOTHING BETTER THAN GRATITUDE OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT A PERSUASION OF HER PARTIALITY FOR HIM
NOTHING TO LAY TO HER CHARGE BUT HER BEING THE INVOLUNTARY UNCONSCIOUS OBJECT OF A DECEPTION WHICH HIS PRIDE COULD NOT PARDON AND WHICH A BETTER PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO OWN
HER MOTHER COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THEM NOW TO BE GREATLY INCREASED SHE COULD NEITHER SIT STILL NOR EMPLOY HERSELF FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER WALKING ROUND THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF NOTHING BUT MOTION WAS VOLUNTARY
AND HIS OWN SPECULATIONS HE HAD YET SOMETHING MORE IN RESERVE AND THE TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HER FATHER COULD GIVE HER WOULD BE A PRETTY ADDITION TO MISTER ALLEN'S ESTATE
THE PUBLIC ARE ENTREATED TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE IT WAS FINISHED MANY MORE SINCE IT WAS BEGUN AND THAT DURING THAT PERIOD PLACES MANNERS BOOKS AND OPINIONS HAVE UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE CHANGES
THIS LITTLE WORK WAS FINISHED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN O THREE AND INTENDED FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION IT WAS DISPOSED OF TO A BOOKSELLER IT WAS EVEN ADVERTISED
HE STEADILY REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIS FATHER INTO HEREFORDSHIRE AN ENGAGEMENT FORMED ALMOST AT THE MOMENT TO PROMOTE THE DISMISSAL OF CATHERINE AND AS STEADILY DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF OFFERING HER HIS HAND
HAD BEEN OPEN AND BOLD THE GENERAL ACCUSTOMED ON EVERY ORDINARY OCCASION TO GIVE THE LAW IN HIS FAMILY PREPARED FOR NO RELUCTANCE BUT OF FEELING
FOR TEN TO ONE WHETHER YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN YOU SHOULD NEVER FRET ABOUT TRIFLES AFTER A SHORT SILENCE I HOPE MY CATHERINE YOU ARE NOT GETTING OUT OF HUMOUR WITH HOME BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO GRAND AS NORTHANGER
AS HE HAD LATELY HAD PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITIES OF DISCOVERING AIMING AT A STYLE OF LIFE WHICH THEIR FORTUNE COULD NOT WARRANT SEEKING TO BETTER THEMSELVES BY WEALTHY CONNECTIONS A FORWARD BRAGGING SCHEMING RACE
AND HIS OWN VIEWS ON ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH HE BOASTED WITH ALMOST EQUAL OPENNESS SEEMED SUFFICIENT VOUCHERS FOR HIS TRUTH AND TO THESE WERE ADDED THE ABSOLUTE FACTS OF THE ALLENS BEING WEALTHY AND CHILDLESS
OF MISS MORLAND'S BEING UNDER THEIR CARE AND AS SOON AS HIS ACQUAINTANCE ALLOWED HIM TO JUDGE OF THEIR TREATING HER WITH PARENTAL KINDNESS HIS RESOLUTION WAS SOON FORMED
CATHERINE HERSELF COULD NOT BE MORE IGNORANT AT THE TIME OF ALL THIS THAN HIS OWN CHILDREN HENRY AND ELEANOR PERCEIVING NOTHING IN HER SITUATION LIKELY TO ENGAGE THEIR FATHER'S PARTICULAR RESPECT
CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY
THERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDREN
NOT MERELY TO DOLLS BUT TO THE MORE HEROIC ENJOYMENTS OF INFANCY NURSING A DORMOUSE FEEDING A CANARY BIRD OR WATERING A ROSE BUSH INDEED SHE HAD NO TASTE FOR A GARDEN
ON HIS RETURN FROM WOODSTON TWO DAYS BEFORE HE HAD BEEN MET NEAR THE ABBEY BY HIS IMPATIENT FATHER HASTILY INFORMED IN ANGRY TERMS OF MISS MORLAND'S DEPARTURE AND ORDERED TO THINK OF HER NO MORE
AS THE CAUSE OF HIS INTRUSION HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIMSELF TO AN UNCANDID JUDGE OR A RESENTFUL HEART FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HIM OR HIS SISTER IN THEIR FATHER'S MISCONDUCT
AND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES
WITHOUT HAVING SEEN ONE AMIABLE YOUTH WHO COULD CALL FORTH HER SENSIBILITY WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED ONE REAL PASSION AND WITHOUT HAVING EXCITED EVEN ANY ADMIRATION BUT WHAT WAS VERY MODERATE AND VERY TRANSIENT
MISSUS BATES THE WIDOW OF A FORMER VICAR OF HIGHBURY WAS A VERY OLD LADY ALMOST PAST EVERY THING BUT TEA AND QUADRILLE SHE LIVED WITH HER SINGLE DAUGHTER IN A VERY SMALL WAY
HER FATHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER WITH NO PROSPECT OF A THIRD TO CHEER A LONG EVENING HER FATHER COMPOSED HIMSELF TO SLEEP AFTER DINNER AS USUAL
AND I AM SURE SHE WILL MISS HER MORE THAN SHE THINKS FOR EMMA TURNED AWAY HER HEAD DIVIDED BETWEEN TEARS AND SMILES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT AND HAPPY WAS SHE FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE IN THE POWER
QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING
AND THEREFORE CANNOT ALLOW HERSELF TO FEEL SO MUCH PAIN AS PLEASURE EVERY FRIEND OF MISS TAYLOR MUST BE GLAD TO HAVE HER SO HAPPILY MARRIED
WHO HAD FALLEN LITTLE SHORT OF A MOTHER IN AFFECTION SIXTEEN YEARS HAD MISS TAYLOR BEEN IN MISTER WOODHOUSE'S FAMILY LESS AS A GOVERNESS THAN A FRIEND VERY FOND OF BOTH DAUGHTERS BUT PARTICULARLY OF EMMA
THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD I KNOW AND WHAT YOU WOULD CERTAINLY SAY IF MY FATHER WERE NOT BY I BELIEVE IT IS VERY TRUE MY DEAR INDEED SAID MISTER WOODHOUSE WITH A SIGH I AM AFRAID I AM SOMETIMES VERY FANCIFUL AND TROUBLESOME
SHE WAS SHORT PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING WITH WHAT SELF DENYING GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND PROMOTED THE MATCH BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY
IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE
AND THE SHADOW OF AUTHORITY BEING NOW LONG PASSED AWAY THEY HAD BEEN LIVING TOGETHER AS FRIEND AND FRIEND VERY MUTUALLY ATTACHED AND EMMA DOING JUST WHAT SHE LIKED HIGHLY ESTEEMING MISS TAYLOR'S JUDGMENT BUT DIRECTED CHIEFLY BY HER OWN
THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM AND THE SMILES OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING THROWN AWAY AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET
AND HAD LIVED NEARLY TWENTY ONE YEARS IN THE WORLD WITH VERY LITTLE TO DISTRESS OR VEX HER SHE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE TWO DAUGHTERS OF A MOST AFFECTIONATE INDULGENT FATHER AND HAD IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER SISTER'S MARRIAGE
LET EMMA HELP YOU TO A LITTLE BIT OF TART A VERY LITTLE BIT OURS ARE ALL APPLE TARTS YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF UNWHOLESOME PRESERVES HERE I DO NOT ADVISE THE CUSTARD MISSUS GODDARD WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS
BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND WHERE GIRLS MIGHT BE SENT TO BE OUT OF THE WAY AND SCRAMBLE THEMSELVES INTO A LITTLE EDUCATION
OH NO WE ALL FELT THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ONLY HALF A MILE APART AND WERE SURE OF MEETING EVERY DAY DEAR EMMA BEARS EVERY THING SO WELL SAID HER FATHER BUT MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHE IS REALLY VERY SORRY TO LOSE POOR MISS TAYLOR
BY THE BYE I HAVE NOT WISHED YOU JOY BEING PRETTY WELL AWARE OF WHAT SORT OF JOY YOU MUST BOTH BE FEELING I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST
SHE HAD MANY ACQUAINTANCE IN THE PLACE FOR HER FATHER WAS UNIVERSALLY CIVIL BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF DOING HIM A SERVICE MISTER ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN TO BE SURE AND A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM
RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES AND MISTER WOODHOUSE HAD NOT MARRIED EARLY WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE
BUT WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSE OF HER OWN THIS IS THREE TIMES AS LARGE AND YOU HAVE NEVER ANY ODD HUMOURS MY DEAR HOW OFTEN WE SHALL BE GOING TO SEE THEM AND THEY COMING TO SEE US WE SHALL BE ALWAYS MEETING WE MUST BEGIN
IN LONG SENTENCES OF REFINED NONSENSE TO COMBINE LIBERAL ACQUIREMENTS WITH ELEGANT MORALITY UPON NEW PRINCIPLES AND NEW SYSTEMS AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY
AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO
PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
ONLY ONE MORE PAPA ONLY FOR MISTER ELTON POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM
WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
AH POOR MISS TAYLOR TIS A SAD BUSINESS POOR MISTER AND MISS WOODHOUSE IF YOU PLEASE BUT I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY POOR MISS TAYLOR I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND EMMA
AND SHE HAD THEN ONLY TO SIT AND THINK OF WHAT SHE HAD LOST THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND MISTER WESTON WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER EASY FORTUNE SUITABLE AGE AND PLEASANT MANNERS
SHE HAD NO VISIBLE FRIENDS BUT WHAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED AT HIGHBURY AND WAS NOW JUST RETURNED FROM A LONG VISIT IN THE COUNTRY TO SOME YOUNG LADIES WHO HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL THERE WITH HER SHE WAS A VERY PRETTY GIRL AND HER BEAUTY HAPPENED TO BE OF A SORT WHICH EMMA PARTICULARLY ADMIRED
FOR WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES I PROMISE YOU TO MAKE NONE FOR MYSELF PAPA BUT I MUST INDEED FOR OTHER PEOPLE IT IS THE GREATEST AMUSEMENT IN THE WORLD AND AFTER SUCH SUCCESS YOU KNOW
BEEN MISTRESS OF HIS HOUSE FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD HER MOTHER HAD DIED TOO LONG AGO FOR HER TO HAVE MORE THAN AN INDISTINCT REMEMBRANCE OF HER CARESSES AND HER PLACE HAD BEEN SUPPLIED BY AN EXCELLENT WOMAN AS GOVERNESS
MY DEAREST PAPA YOU DO NOT THINK I COULD MEAN YOU OR SUPPOSE MISTER KNIGHTLEY TO MEAN YOU WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA OH NO I MEANT ONLY MYSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME YOU KNOW IN A JOKE IT IS ALL A JOKE
BUT I THINK THERE MAY BE A THIRD A SOMETHING BETWEEN THE DO NOTHING AND THE DO ALL IF I HAD NOT PROMOTED MISTER WESTON'S VISITS HERE AND GIVEN MANY LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENTS AND SMOOTHED MANY LITTLE MATTERS IT MIGHT NOT HAVE COME TO ANY THING AFTER ALL
HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS AND HOPED BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY THROUGH THE EVENING AND BE ATTACKED BY NO REGRETS BUT HER OWN
AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER HE COULD NOT MEET HER IN CONVERSATION
SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES
EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO THAT MISS TAYLOR AND I MET WITH HIM IN BROADWAY LANE WHEN BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO DRIZZLE HE DARTED AWAY WITH SO MUCH GALLANTRY AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT
AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED
AND I AM SURE SHE WILL MAKE A VERY GOOD SERVANT SHE IS A CIVIL PRETTY SPOKEN GIRL I HAVE A GREAT OPINION OF HER WHENEVER I SEE HER SHE ALWAYS CURTSEYS AND ASKS ME HOW I DO IN A VERY PRETTY MANNER
HE HAD RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER AFTER SOME DAYS ABSENCE
WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN
NOT AT ALL SIR IT IS A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND SO MILD THAT I MUST DRAW BACK FROM YOUR GREAT FIRE BUT YOU MUST HAVE FOUND IT VERY DAMP AND DIRTY I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD
FOR MISS SMITH WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHOM EMMA KNEW VERY WELL BY SIGHT AND HAD LONG FELT AN INTEREST IN ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEAUTY A VERY GRACIOUS INVITATION WAS RETURNED AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION
OH NO MISTER WESTON CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN SOME PEOPLE EVEN TALKED OF A PROMISE TO HIS WIFE ON HER DEATHBED AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT
SHE KNEW IT WOULD BE SO MUCH LESS SO TO HER FATHER THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIM REALLY SUSPECT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE AS HER NOT BEING THOUGHT PERFECT BY EVERY BODY EMMA KNOWS I NEVER FLATTER HER SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER IT WAS VERY LUCKY FOR I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD POOR JAMES THINK HIMSELF SLIGHTED UPON ANY ACCOUNT
THE BACKGAMMON TABLE WAS PLACED BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WALKED IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY MISTER KNIGHTLEY A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT AND THIRTY WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF DEPENDENCE OR INDEPENDENCE AT ANY RATE IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE SAID EMMA PLAYFULLY
WHICH EXACTLY SUITED MISTER WOODHOUSE FULL OF TRIVIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND HARMLESS GOSSIP MISSUS GODDARD WAS THE MISTRESS OF A SCHOOL NOT OF A SEMINARY OR AN ESTABLISHMENT OR ANY THING WHICH PROFESSED
TO BE THE INTIMATES OF A GIRL WHO WANTED ONLY A LITTLE MORE KNOWLEDGE AND ELEGANCE TO BE QUITE PERFECT SHE WOULD NOTICE HER SHE WOULD IMPROVE HER SHE WOULD DETACH HER FROM HER BAD ACQUAINTANCE AND INTRODUCE HER INTO GOOD SOCIETY
BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU PAPA
AND I AGREE WITH YOU ENTIRELY THAT IT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING INVITE HIM TO DINNER EMMA AND HELP HIM TO THE BEST OF THE FISH AND THE CHICKEN
AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM
EMMA NEVER THINKS OF HERSELF IF SHE CAN DO GOOD TO OTHERS REJOINED MISTER WOODHOUSE UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART
THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED THAT THEY DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RANK AS MISFORTUNES WITH HER SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED
THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS
DIRTY SIR LOOK AT MY SHOES NOT A SPECK ON THEM WELL THAT IS QUITE SURPRISING FOR WE HAVE HAD A VAST DEAL OF RAIN HERE IT RAINED DREADFULLY HARD FOR HALF AN HOUR WHILE WE WERE AT BREAKFAST I WANTED THEM TO PUT OFF THE WEDDING
THE CARRIAGE BUT JAMES WILL NOT LIKE TO PUT THE HORSES TO FOR SUCH A LITTLE WAY AND WHERE ARE THE POOR HORSES TO BE WHILE WE ARE PAYING OUR VISIT THEY ARE TO BE PUT INTO MISTER WESTON'S STABLE PAPA YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS
AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY A NOTE WAS BROUGHT FROM MISSUS GODDARD REQUESTING IN MOST RESPECTFUL TERMS TO BE ALLOWED TO BRING MISS SMITH WITH HER A MOST WELCOME REQUEST
AND YET SHE WAS A HAPPY WOMAN AND A WOMAN WHOM NO ONE NAMED WITHOUT GOOD WILL IT WAS HER OWN UNIVERSAL GOOD WILL AND CONTENTED TEMPER WHICH WORKED SUCH WONDERS SHE LOVED EVERY BODY WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS
THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT
YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE WEDDING AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU FOR WE ALL BEHAVED CHARMINGLY EVERY BODY WAS PUNCTUAL EVERY BODY IN THEIR BEST LOOKS NOT A TEAR AND HARDLY A LONG FACE TO BE SEEN
THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS
EVERY BODY SAID THAT MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN OH DEAR NO MISTER WESTON WHO HAD BEEN A WIDOWER SO LONG
BUT I MEANT NO REFLECTION ON ANY BODY MISS TAYLOR HAS BEEN USED TO HAVE TWO PERSONS TO PLEASE SHE WILL NOW HAVE BUT ONE THE CHANCES ARE THAT SHE MUST BE A GAINER WELL SAID EMMA WILLING TO LET IT PASS
THE HAPPINESS OF MISS SMITH WAS QUITE EQUAL TO HER INTENTIONS MISS WOODHOUSE WAS SO GREAT A PERSONAGE IN HIGHBURY THAT THE PROSPECT OF THE INTRODUCTION HAD GIVEN AS MUCH PANIC AS PLEASURE
EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
MISTER WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD AND HIS GOOD NATURE FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER
FOR DEPEND UPON IT A LUCKY GUESS IS NEVER MERELY LUCK THERE IS ALWAYS SOME TALENT IN IT AND AS TO MY POOR WORD SUCCESS WHICH YOU QUARREL WITH I DO NOT KNOW THAT I AM SO ENTIRELY WITHOUT ANY CLAIM TO IT YOU HAVE DRAWN TWO PRETTY PICTURES
AS RENTING A LARGE FARM OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND RESIDING IN THE PARISH OF DONWELL VERY CREDITABLY SHE BELIEVED SHE KNEW MISTER KNIGHTLEY THOUGHT HIGHLY OF THEM BUT THEY MUST BE COARSE AND UNPOLISHED AND VERY UNFIT
HOW WAS SHE TO BEAR THE CHANGE IT WAS TRUE THAT HER FRIEND WAS GOING ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM BUT EMMA WAS AWARE THAT GREAT MUST BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MISSUS WESTON ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE
I OBSERVE SHE ALWAYS TURNS THE LOCK OF THE DOOR THE RIGHT WAY AND NEVER BANGS IT I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT AND IT WILL BE A GREAT COMFORT TO POOR MISS TAYLOR TO HAVE SOMEBODY ABOUT HER THAT SHE IS USED TO SEE WHENEVER JAMES GOES OVER TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER YOU KNOW SHE WILL BE HEARING OF US
WHERE IS YOUR MERIT WHAT ARE YOU PROUD OF YOU MADE A LUCKY GUESS AND THAT IS ALL THAT CAN BE SAID AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS I PITY YOU I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER
I THINK YOU MUST KNOW HARTFIELD ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND THAT A STRAIGHTFORWARD OPEN HEARTED MAN LIKE WESTON AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS
AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE ONE THAT I MADE THE MATCH MYSELF I MADE THE MATCH YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO
WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY HE WAS A MUCH OLDER MAN IN WAYS THAN IN YEARS AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER
BETWEEN THEM IT WAS MORE THE INTIMACY OF SISTERS EVEN BEFORE MISS TAYLOR HAD CEASED TO HOLD THE NOMINAL OFFICE OF GOVERNESS
THOUGH AS FAR AS SHE WAS HERSELF CONCERNED IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON
TILL HER FATHER AWOKE AND MADE IT NECESSARY TO BE CHEERFUL HIS SPIRITS REQUIRED SUPPORT HE WAS A NERVOUS MAN EASILY DEPRESSED FOND OF EVERY BODY THAT HE WAS USED TO AND HATING TO PART WITH THEM
SUCCESS SUPPOSES ENDEAVOUR YOUR TIME HAS BEEN PROPERLY AND DELICATELY SPENT IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND
BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND AND THEIR LITTLE CHILDREN TO FILL THE HOUSE AND GIVE HER PLEASANT SOCIETY AGAIN HIGHBURY THE LARGE AND POPULOUS VILLAGE ALMOST AMOUNTING TO A TOWN
FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF
SERLE UNDERSTANDS BOILING AN EGG BETTER THAN ANY BODY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU MISS BATES
WE MUST GO AND PAY WEDDING VISIT VERY SOON MY DEAR HOW AM I TO GET SO FAR RANDALLS IS SUCH A DISTANCE I COULD NOT WALK HALF SO FAR NO PAPA NOBODY THOUGHT OF YOUR WALKING WE MUST GO IN THE CARRIAGE TO BE SURE
YOU KNOW I CANNOT MISTER WESTON IS SUCH A GOOD HUMOURED PLEASANT EXCELLENT MAN THAT HE THOROUGHLY DESERVES A GOOD WIFE AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MISS TAYLOR LIVE WITH US FOR EVER AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN A HOUSE OF HER OWN
AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES HAD IT TAKEN PLACE ONLY ONCE A YEAR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRIEVANCE
I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA YOU CANNOT THINK THAT I SHALL LEAVE OFF MATCH MAKING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY SUCCESS SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
NOT UNFREQUENTLY THROUGH EMMA'S PERSUASION HE HAD SOME OF THE CHOSEN AND THE BEST TO DINE WITH HIM BUT EVENING PARTIES WERE WHAT HE PREFERRED AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY
ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY THAT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING I DARE SAY MISTER KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO MEET HIM WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE SIR AT ANY TIME SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY LAUGHING
AND WAS CONSIDERED WITH ALL THE REGARD AND RESPECT WHICH A HARMLESS OLD LADY UNDER SUCH UNTOWARD CIRCUMSTANCES CAN EXCITE HER DAUGHTER ENJOYED A MOST UNCOMMON DEGREE OF POPULARITY FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED
WE TALKED IT ALL OVER WITH MISTER WESTON LAST NIGHT AND AS FOR JAMES YOU MAY BE VERY SURE HE WILL ALWAYS LIKE GOING TO RANDALLS BECAUSE OF HIS DAUGHTER'S BEING HOUSEMAID THERE I ONLY DOUBT WHETHER HE WILL EVER TAKE US ANYWHERE ELSE THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA
WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE WITH AN ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE OF A SPIRIT WHICH YET WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY
AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE
THE REAL EVILS INDEED OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO WELL OF HERSELF THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED ALLOY TO HER MANY ENJOYMENTS
SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT
HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL AND SOMEBODY HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR TO THAT OF PARLOUR BOARDER THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN OF HER HISTORY
HATING CHANGE OF EVERY KIND MATRIMONY AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING
AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY NOT UNWILLING TO TALK
ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT WELL INFORMED USEFUL GENTLE KNOWING ALL THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY
WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE SAID MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN MAY COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED AH MY DEAR I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS
AND ANIMATED MISTER WOODHOUSE FOR SOME TIME MISTER KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER POOR ISABELLA AND HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY WHEN THIS WAS OVER MISTER WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED
WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL AND HELP AND RECOMMEND THE MINCED CHICKEN AND SCALLOPED OYSTERS
WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF COMING BACK PRODIGIES MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL WAS IN HIGH REPUTE AND VERY DESERVEDLY FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD
LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER AND IN WINTER DRESSED THEIR CHILBLAINS WITH HER OWN HANDS IT WAS NO WONDER THAT A TRAIN OF TWENTY YOUNG COUPLE NOW WALKED AFTER HER TO CHURCH SHE WAS A PLAIN MOTHERLY KIND OF WOMAN WHO HAD WORKED HARD IN HER YOUTH
LOOKED AT HER ANXIOUSLY CATHERINE TOOK HER PLACE AT THE TABLE AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ELEANOR SAID NO BAD NEWS FROM FULLERTON I HOPE MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS I HOPE THEY ARE NONE OF THEM ILL
WHAT SHE WOULD BE AT FOR THERE COULD BE NO NEED OF MY BEING PLAYED OFF TO MAKE HER SECURE OF TILNEY WE PARTED AT LAST BY MUTUAL CONSENT HAPPY FOR ME HAD WE NEVER MET
ARTLESS GUILELESS WITH AFFECTIONS STRONG BUT SIMPLE FORMING NO PRETENSIONS AND KNOWING NO DISGUISE SUCH A SISTER IN LAW HENRY I SHOULD DELIGHT IN SAID ELEANOR WITH A SMILE
AND DIVIDED AT THE NIB LIKE AN ORDINARY PEN DANTES EXAMINED IT WITH INTENSE ADMIRATION THEN LOOKED AROUND TO SEE THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN SHAPED SO CORRECTLY INTO FORM AH YES SAID FARIA THE PENKNIFE
LOOK AT THIS RAY OF LIGHT WHICH ENTERS BY MY WINDOW SAID THE ABBE AND THEN OBSERVE THE LINES TRACED ON THE WALL WELL BY MEANS OF THESE LINES WHICH ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOUBLE MOTION OF THE EARTH AND THE ELLIPSE IT DESCRIBES ROUND THE SUN
SHE HATED HERSELF MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS HE HAD SHE THOUGHT HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE THIS FATAL MORNING SHOWN SOMETHING LIKE AFFECTION FOR HER BUT NOW
THE EVENING WORE AWAY WITH NO ABATEMENT OF THIS SOOTHING POLITENESS AND HER SPIRITS WERE GRADUALLY RAISED TO A MODEST TRANQUILLITY SHE DID NOT LEARN EITHER TO FORGET OR DEFEND THE PAST
AS SOON AS SHE DARED LEAVE THE TABLE SHE HURRIED AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM BUT THE HOUSEMAIDS WERE BUSY IN IT AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO COME DOWN AGAIN SHE TURNED INTO THE DRAWING ROOM FOR PRIVACY BUT HENRY AND ELEANOR HAD LIKEWISE RETREATED THITHER
BUT SHE LEARNED TO HOPE THAT IT WOULD NEVER TRANSPIRE FARTHER AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT COST HER HENRY'S ENTIRE REGARD HER THOUGHTS BEING STILL CHIEFLY FIXED ON WHAT SHE HAD WITH SUCH CAUSELESS TERROR FELT AND DONE NOTHING COULD SHORTLY BE CLEARER
I FURNISHED MYSELF WITH A LIGHT
AFTER ELEANOR HAD AFFECTIONATELY EXPRESSED A WISH OF BEING OF USE OR COMFORT TO HER AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S FREE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF AND REFLECTION CATHERINE FELT EQUAL TO ENCOUNTERING HER FRIENDS
UPON SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO BE NOT PERFECTLY AMIABLE HER MIND MADE UP ON THESE SEVERAL POINTS AND HER RESOLUTION FORMED OF ALWAYS JUDGING AND ACTING IN FUTURE WITH THE GREATEST GOOD SENSE
YOU MUST BE BLESSED INDEED TO POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE THE ABBE SMILED WELL SAID HE BUT YOU HAD ANOTHER SUBJECT FOR YOUR THOUGHTS DID YOU NOT SAY SO JUST NOW I DID
AND ESPECIALLY WAS SHE ANXIOUS TO BE ASSURED OF ISABELLA'S HAVING MATCHED SOME FINE NETTING COTTON ON WHICH SHE HAD LEFT HER INTENT AND OF HER CONTINUING ON THE BEST TERMS WITH JAMES
THOUGH GOD KNOWS WITH LITTLE INCLINATION FOR WRITING I THINK IT MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS AT AN END BETWEEN MISS THORPE AND ME I LEFT HER AND BATH YESTERDAY NEVER TO SEE EITHER AGAIN
BUT WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF THE ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE TO INDIA AND TWO OR THREE VOYAGES TO THE LEVANT UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE RECITAL OF HIS LAST CRUISE WITH THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN LECLERE AND THE RECEIPT OF A PACKET TO BE DELIVERED BY HIMSELF TO THE GRAND MARSHAL
JAMES ONLY MEANS TO GIVE ME GOOD ADVICE HE GLADLY RECEIVED THE LETTER AND HAVING READ IT THROUGH WITH CLOSE ATTENTION RETURNED IT SAYING WELL IF IT IS TO BE SO I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I AM SORRY FOR IT
THAT I AM NEVER TO HEAR FROM HER PERHAPS NEVER TO SEE HER AGAIN
AND WERE AT THAT MOMENT DEEP IN CONSULTATION ABOUT HER SHE DREW BACK TRYING TO BEG THEIR PARDON BUT WAS WITH GENTLE VIOLENCE FORCED TO RETURN AND THE OTHERS WITHDREW
CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE
THE ANXIETIES OF COMMON LIFE BEGAN SOON TO SUCCEED TO THE ALARMS OF ROMANCE HER DESIRE OF HEARING FROM ISABELLA GREW EVERY DAY GREATER SHE WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO KNOW HOW THE BATH WORLD WENT ON AND HOW THE ROOMS WERE ATTENDED
UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF EVEN IN HENRY AND ELEANOR TILNEY SOME SLIGHT IMPERFECTION MIGHT HEREAFTER APPEAR
MURDER WAS NOT TOLERATED SERVANTS WERE NOT SLAVES AND NEITHER POISON NOR SLEEPING POTIONS TO BE PROCURED LIKE RHUBARB FROM EVERY DRUGGIST AMONG THE ALPS AND PYRENEES PERHAPS THERE WERE NO MIXED CHARACTERS
SAID THE ABBE WE HAVE SOME HOURS BEFORE US IT IS NOW JUST A QUARTER PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK INSTINCTIVELY DANTES TURNED ROUND TO OBSERVE BY WHAT WATCH OR CLOCK THE ABBE HAD BEEN ABLE SO ACCURATELY TO SPECIFY THE HOUR
APPEARED TO HIM PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE EACH WORD THAT FELL FROM HIS COMPANION'S LIPS SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH THE MYSTERIES OF SCIENCE AS WORTHY OF DIGGING OUT AS THE GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE MINES OF GUZERAT AND GOLCONDA
I DO NOT THINK I SHALL EVER WISH FOR A LETTER AGAIN I AM SORRY SAID HENRY CLOSING THE BOOK HE HAD JUST OPENED IF I HAD SUSPECTED THE LETTER OF CONTAINING ANYTHING UNWELCOME I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS
FROM EVEN LOOKING HIS SURPRISE BY HIS FATHER'S ENTRANCE THEY WENT TO BREAKFAST DIRECTLY BUT CATHERINE COULD HARDLY EAT ANYTHING TEARS FILLED HER EYES AND EVEN RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS AS SHE SAT THE LETTER WAS ONE MOMENT IN HER HAND
LONG BEFORE HER QUITTING BATH AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT OF READING WHICH SHE HAD THERE INDULGED
DEAREST CATHERINE BEWARE HOW YOU GIVE YOUR HEART
INCONCEIVABLE HENRY FREDERICK TOO WHO ALWAYS WORE HIS HEART SO PROUDLY
LAID ONE OVER THE OTHER LIKE FOLDS OF PAPYRUS THESE ROLLS CONSISTED OF SLIPS OF CLOTH ABOUT FOUR INCHES WIDE AND EIGHTEEN LONG THEY WERE ALL CAREFULLY NUMBERED AND CLOSELY COVERED WITH WRITING SO LEGIBLE THAT DANTES COULD EASILY READ IT
AS YET BUT ONE OF THEM LET ME HEAR THE OTHER IT WAS THIS THAT WHILE YOU HAD RELATED TO ME ALL THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR PAST LIFE YOU WERE PERFECTLY UNACQUAINTED WITH MINE YOUR LIFE MY YOUNG FRIEND HAS NOT BEEN OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH
HIS INTERVIEW WITH THAT PERSONAGE AND HIS RECEIVING IN PLACE OF THE PACKET BROUGHT A LETTER ADDRESSED TO A MONSIEUR NOIRTIER HIS ARRIVAL AT MARSEILLES AND INTERVIEW WITH HIS FATHER HIS AFFECTION FOR MERCEDES AND THEIR NUPTUAL FEAST
WHAT IS MOST TO THE CREDIT OF HUMAN NATURE SUCH FEELINGS OUGHT TO BE INVESTIGATED THAT THEY MAY KNOW THEMSELVES
SO THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINISH MY WORK HERE AND WAS IT NOT DISCOVERED THAT YOUR SHEETS WERE UNHEMMED
I AM SURE I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO LEAVE YOU SO SOON BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY DREADFUL FOR ME TO BE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY ELEANOR'S WORK WAS SUSPENDED WHILE SHE GAZED WITH INCREASING ASTONISHMENT
WILL YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE OF READING TO US THE PASSAGES WHICH CONCERN MY BROTHER NO READ IT YOURSELF CRIED CATHERINE WHOSE SECOND THOUGHTS WERE CLEARER I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING OF BLUSHING AGAIN THAT SHE HAD BLUSHED BEFORE
NOW LET ME BEHOLD THE CURIOUS PENS WITH WHICH YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOUR WORK LOOK
I WROTE THE WORD FINIS AT THE END OF THE SIXTY EIGHTH STRIP ABOUT A WEEK AGO I HAVE TORN UP TWO OF MY SHIRTS AND AS MANY HANDKERCHIEFS AS I WAS MASTER OF TO COMPLETE THE PRECIOUS PAGES
MOST BITTERLY DID SHE CRY IT WAS NOT ONLY WITH HERSELF THAT SHE WAS SUNK BUT WITH HENRY HER FOLLY WHICH NOW SEEMED EVEN CRIMINAL WAS ALL EXPOSED TO HIM AND HE MUST DESPISE HER FOREVER
WHICH HE COULD JUST RECOLLECT HAVING VISITED DURING A VOYAGE MADE IN HIS EARLIEST YOUTH
AND NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT IN NEVER ALLUDING IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY TO WHAT HAD PASSED WAS OF THE GREATEST ASSISTANCE TO HER AND SOONER THAN SHE COULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HER DISTRESS HER SPIRITS BECAME ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE
AND CAPABLE AS HERETOFORE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT BY ANYTHING HE SAID THERE WERE STILL SOME SUBJECTS INDEED UNDER WHICH SHE BELIEVED THEY MUST ALWAYS TREMBLE THE MENTION OF A CHEST OR A CABINET FOR INSTANCE
INTO WHICH THE ABBE'S CELL OPENED FROM THAT POINT THE PASSAGE BECAME MUCH NARROWER AND BARELY PERMITTED ONE TO CREEP THROUGH ON HANDS AND KNEES THE FLOOR OF THE ABBE'S CELL WAS PAVED AND IT HAD BEEN BY RAISING ONE OF THE STONES IN THE MOST OBSCURE CORNER
HIS ARREST AND SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION HIS TEMPORARY DETENTION AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE AND HIS FINAL IMPRISONMENT IN THE CHATEAU D'IF FROM THIS POINT EVERYTHING WAS A BLANK TO DANTES HE KNEW NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED
AND WHICH SUDDEN CHANCE FREQUENTLY BRINGS ABOUT WHILE AFFECTING TO BE DEEPLY ENGAGED IN EXAMINING THE LADDER THE MIND OF DANTES WAS IN FACT BUSILY OCCUPIED BY THE IDEA
AND MATCHES I PRETENDED THAT I HAD A DISORDER OF THE SKIN AND ASKED FOR A LITTLE SULPHUR WHICH WAS READILY SUPPLIED DANTES LAID THE DIFFERENT THINGS HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT ON THE TABLE AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAD DROOPING ON HIS BREAST
AS THOUGH OVERWHELMED BY THE PERSEVERANCE AND STRENGTH OF FARIA'S MIND YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ALL YET CONTINUED FARIA FOR I DID NOT THINK IT WISE TO TRUST ALL MY TREASURES IN THE SAME HIDING PLACE LET US SHUT THIS ONE UP
YOU THINK IT IS ALL FOR AMBITION THEN AND UPON MY WORD THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT SEEM VERY LIKE IT I CANNOT FORGET THAT WHEN SHE FIRST KNEW WHAT MY FATHER WOULD DO FOR THEM SHE SEEMED QUITE DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT MORE
I WOULD FAIN FIX THE SOURCE OF IT ON MAN THAT I MAY NO LONGER VENT REPROACHES UPON HEAVEN
IT IS ALL OVER WITH FREDERICK INDEED HE IS A DECEASED MAN DEFUNCT IN UNDERSTANDING PREPARE FOR YOUR SISTER IN LAW ELEANOR AND SUCH A SISTER IN LAW AS YOU MUST DELIGHT IN OPEN CANDID
YOU LOSE HALF YOURSELF YOU FEEL A VOID IN YOUR HEART WHICH NOTHING ELSE CAN OCCUPY SOCIETY IS BECOMING IRKSOME AND AS FOR THE AMUSEMENTS IN WHICH YOU WERE WONT TO SHARE AT BATH THE VERY IDEA OF THEM WITHOUT HER IS ABHORRENT
SERVING AS A SAFE DEPOSITORY OF THE ARTICLES MENTIONED TO DANTES
SHOULD I EVER GET OUT OF PRISON AND FIND IN ALL ITALY A PRINTER COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO PUBLISH WHAT I HAVE COMPOSED MY LITERARY REPUTATION IS FOREVER SECURED I SEE ANSWERED DANTES
MY FATHER AND MERCEDES COME SAID THE ABBE CLOSING HIS HIDING PLACE AND PUSHING THE BED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL SITUATION LET ME HEAR YOUR STORY DANTES OBEYED AND COMMENCED WHAT HE CALLED HIS HISTORY
AND YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT FROM THE COLLISION OF CLOUDS ELECTRICITY IS PRODUCED FROM ELECTRICITY LIGHTNING FROM LIGHTNING ILLUMINATION NO REPLIED DANTES I KNOW NOTHING
I HEMMED THE EDGES OVER AGAIN WITH WHAT WITH THIS NEEDLE SAID THE ABBE AS OPENING HIS RAGGED VESTMENTS HE SHOWED DANTES A LONG SHARP FISH BONE WITH A SMALL PERFORATED EYE FOR THE THREAD A SMALL PORTION OF WHICH STILL REMAINED IN IT
LET ME SOON HEAR FROM YOU DEAR CATHERINE YOU ARE MY ONLY FRIEND YOUR LOVE I DO BUILD UPON I WISH YOUR VISIT AT NORTHANGER MAY BE OVER BEFORE CAPTAIN TILNEY MAKES HIS ENGAGEMENT KNOWN
I AM ASHAMED TO THINK HOW LONG I BORE WITH IT BUT IF EVER MAN HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HIMSELF LOVED I WAS THAT MAN I CANNOT UNDERSTAND EVEN NOW
THAN THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL A VOLUNTARY SELF CREATED DELUSION EACH TRIFLING CIRCUMSTANCE RECEIVING IMPORTANCE FROM AN IMAGINATION RESOLVED ON ALARM AND EVERYTHING FORCED TO BEND TO ONE PURPOSE BY A MIND WHICH
SHE THANKED HIM AS HEARTILY AS IF HE HAD WRITTEN IT HIMSELF TIS ONLY FROM JAMES HOWEVER AS SHE LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION SHE OPENED IT IT WAS FROM OXFORD AND TO THIS PURPOSE DEAR CATHERINE
AND SHORT EXCLAMATIONS OF SORROWING WONDER DECLARED HER TO BE RECEIVING UNPLEASANT NEWS AND HENRY EARNESTLY WATCHING HER THROUGH THE WHOLE LETTER SAW PLAINLY THAT IT ENDED NO BETTER THAN IT BEGAN HE WAS PREVENTED HOWEVER
THE LIBERTY WHICH HER IMAGINATION HAD DARED TO TAKE WITH THE CHARACTER OF HIS FATHER COULD HE EVER FORGIVE IT THE ABSURDITY OF HER CURIOSITY AND HER FEARS COULD THEY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
SUCH A FRIEND AS ISABELLA HAD BEEN TO HER AND THEN THEIR OWN BROTHER SO CLOSELY CONCERNED IN IT SHE BELIEVED SHE MUST WAIVE THE SUBJECT ALTOGETHER HENRY AND ELEANOR WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND EACH AS SHE ENTERED IT
WHO SUPPLIED YOU WITH THE MATERIALS FOR MAKING THIS WONDERFUL WORK I TORE UP SEVERAL OF MY SHIRTS AND RIPPED OUT THE SEAMS IN THE SHEETS OF MY BED DURING MY THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT AT FENESTRELLE
AND EVERYTHING THAT IS BAD IN THE WORLD I HOPE SO FAR AS CONCERNS MY BROTHER YOU ARE MISINFORMED I HOPE HE HAS NOT HAD ANY MATERIAL SHARE IN BRINGING ON MISTER MORLAND'S DISAPPOINTMENT
THANK GOD I AM UNDECEIVED IN TIME BUT IT IS A HEAVY BLOW AFTER MY FATHER'S CONSENT HAD BEEN SO KINDLY GIVEN BUT NO MORE OF THIS SHE HAS MADE ME MISERABLE FOREVER
IN SHORT SHE MADE HERSELF AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WENT DOWN WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK FIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL
IN A STATE OF FREEDOM HAVE EVAPORATED IN A THOUSAND FOLLIES MISFORTUNE IS NEEDED TO BRING TO LIGHT THE TREASURES OF THE HUMAN INTELLECT COMPRESSION IS NEEDED TO EXPLODE GUNPOWDER CAPTIVITY HAS BROUGHT MY MENTAL FACULTIES TO A FOCUS
NIGHT WHY FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE ARE YOUR EYES LIKE CATS THAT YOU CAN SEE TO WORK IN THE DARK INDEED THEY ARE NOT BUT GOD HAS SUPPLIED MAN WITH THE INTELLIGENCE THAT ENABLES HIM TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF NATURAL CONDITIONS
I SHALL NOT ENTER INTO PARTICULARS THEY WOULD ONLY PAIN YOU MORE YOU WILL SOON HEAR ENOUGH FROM ANOTHER QUARTER TO KNOW WHERE LIES THE BLAME
THAN IF I POSSESSED A WATCH FOR THAT MIGHT BE BROKEN OR DERANGED IN ITS MOVEMENTS WHILE THE SUN AND EARTH NEVER VARY IN THEIR APPOINTED PATHS THIS LAST EXPLANATION WAS WHOLLY LOST UPON DANTES WHO HAD ALWAYS IMAGINED
ASKED THE ABBE OH YOUR GREAT WORK ON THE MONARCHY OF ITALY
IT CONTAINED SOMETHING WORSE THAN ANYBODY COULD SUPPOSE POOR JAMES IS SO UNHAPPY YOU WILL SOON KNOW WHY TO HAVE SO KIND HEARTED SO AFFECTIONATE A SISTER REPLIED HENRY WARMLY MUST BE A COMFORT TO HIM UNDER ANY DISTRESS
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF ASKED THE ABBE SMILINGLY IMPUTING THE DEEP ABSTRACTION IN WHICH HIS VISITOR WAS PLUNGED TO THE EXCESS OF HIS AWE AND WONDER I WAS REFLECTING IN THE FIRST PLACE REPLIED DANTES
I SUPPOSE HE WILL HARDLY EVER RECOVER IT YOUR BROTHER IS CERTAINLY VERY MUCH TO BE PITIED AT PRESENT BUT WE MUST NOT IN OUR CONCERN FOR HIS SUFFERINGS UNDERVALUE YOURS YOU FEEL I SUPPOSE THAT IN LOSING ISABELLA
ONE COULD CUT AND THRUST DANTES EXAMINED THE VARIOUS ARTICLES SHOWN TO HIM WITH THE SAME ATTENTION THAT HE HAD BESTOWED ON THE CURIOSITIES AND STRANGE TOOLS EXHIBITED IN THE SHOPS AT MARSEILLES
FREDERICK WILL NOT BE THE FIRST MAN WHO HAS CHOSEN A WIFE WITH LESS SENSE THAN HIS FAMILY EXPECTED I DO NOT ENVY HIS SITUATION EITHER AS A LOVER OR A SON MISS TILNEY
AT CATHERINE'S INVITATION NOW READ THE LETTER LIKEWISE AND HAVING EXPRESSED ALSO HER CONCERN AND SURPRISE BEGAN TO INQUIRE INTO MISS THORPE'S CONNECTIONS AND FORTUNE HER MOTHER IS A VERY GOOD SORT OF WOMAN WAS CATHERINE'S ANSWER
I SEPARATED THE FAT FROM THE MEAT SERVED TO ME MELTED IT AND SO MADE OIL HERE IS MY LAMP SO SAYING THE ABBE EXHIBITED A SORT OF TORCH VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN PUBLIC ILLUMINATIONS
OR YOU WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLY CIRCUMSTANCED POOR THORPE IS IN TOWN I DREAD THE SIGHT OF HIM HIS HONEST HEART WOULD FEEL SO MUCH I HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM AND MY FATHER HER DUPLICITY HURTS ME MORE THAN ALL
I HAVE ONE FAVOUR TO BEG SAID CATHERINE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS IN AN AGITATED MANNER THAT IF YOUR BROTHER SHOULD BE COMING HERE YOU WILL GIVE ME NOTICE OF IT THAT I MAY GO AWAY OUR BROTHER FREDERICK YES
WHAT WAS HER FATHER A LAWYER I BELIEVE THEY LIVE AT PUTNEY ARE THEY A WEALTHY FAMILY NO NOT VERY I DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA HAS ANY FORTUNE AT ALL BUT THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY IN YOUR FAMILY
BUT HENRY BEGAN TO SUSPECT THE TRUTH AND SOMETHING IN WHICH MISS THORPE'S NAME WAS INCLUDED PASSED HIS LIPS HOW QUICK YOU ARE CRIED CATHERINE YOU HAVE GUESSED IT I DECLARE AND YET WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT IT IN BATH
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ABBE'S CHAMBER AFTER HAVING PASSED WITH TOLERABLE EASE THROUGH THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE WHICH HOWEVER DID NOT ADMIT OF THEIR HOLDING THEMSELVES ERECT THE TWO FRIENDS REACHED THE FURTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR
THEN IN HER LAP AND THEN IN HER POCKET AND SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE KNEW NOT WHAT SHE DID THE GENERAL BETWEEN HIS COCOA AND HIS NEWSPAPER HAD LUCKILY NO LEISURE FOR NOTICING HER BUT TO THE OTHER TWO HER DISTRESS WAS EQUALLY VISIBLE
SHOWING TO THE YOUNG MAN A SLENDER STICK ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG AND MUCH RESEMBLING THE SIZE OF THE HANDLE OF A FINE PAINTING BRUSH TO THE END OF WHICH WAS TIED BY A PIECE OF THREAD
THERE SUCH AS WERE NOT AS SPOTLESS AS AN ANGEL MIGHT HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF A FIEND BUT IN ENGLAND IT WAS NOT SO AMONG THE ENGLISH SHE BELIEVED IN THEIR HEARTS AND HABITS
YOU LITTLE THOUGHT OF ITS ENDING SO ISABELLA NO WONDER NOW I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HER ISABELLA HAS DESERTED MY BROTHER AND IS TO MARRY YOURS COULD YOU HAVE BELIEVED THERE HAD BEEN SUCH INCONSTANCY AND FICKLENESS
THE FORMIDABLE HENRY SOON FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER WAS THAT HE PAID HER RATHER MORE ATTENTION THAN USUAL CATHERINE HAD NEVER WANTED COMFORT MORE AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS AWARE OF IT
AS WELL AS MAKE OUT THE SENSE IT BEING IN ITALIAN
CHARMING AS WERE ALL MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S WORKS AND CHARMING EVEN AS WERE THE WORKS OF ALL HER IMITATORS IT WAS NOT IN THEM PERHAPS THAT HUMAN NATURE AT LEAST IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WAS TO BE LOOKED FOR
AND UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE NEED NOT FEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME ACTUAL SPECKS IN THE CHARACTER OF THEIR FATHER WHO THOUGH CLEARED FROM THE GROSSLY INJURIOUS SUSPICIONS WHICH SHE MUST EVER BLUSH TO HAVE ENTERTAINED SHE DID BELIEVE
UPON THE ENORMOUS DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ABILITY YOU MUST HAVE EMPLOYED TO REACH THE HIGH PERFECTION TO WHICH YOU HAVE ATTAINED WHAT WOULD YOU NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IF YOU HAD BEEN FREE POSSIBLY NOTHING AT ALL THE OVERFLOW OF MY BRAIN WOULD PROBABLY
I TOLD YOU HOW I MANAGED TO OBTAIN THAT AND I ONLY JUST MAKE IT FROM TIME TO TIME AS I REQUIRE IT ONE THING STILL PUZZLES ME OBSERVED DANTES AND THAT IS HOW YOU MANAGED TO DO ALL THIS BY DAYLIGHT
TILL THE VERY LAST IF I REASONED WITH HER SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER
SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO FORGIVE HERSELF AND BE HAPPIER THAN EVER AND THE LENIENT HAND OF TIME DID MUCH FOR HER BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS IN THE COURSE OF ANOTHER DAY HENRY'S ASTONISHING GENEROSITY
THAT A PERSON SO INTELLIGENT INGENIOUS AND CLEAR SIGHTED AS THE ABBE MIGHT PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE DARK MYSTERY OF HIS OWN MISFORTUNES WHERE HE HIMSELF COULD SEE NOTHING
I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE YOUR TREASURES THE ABBE SMILED AND PROCEEDING TO THE DISUSED FIREPLACE RAISED BY THE HELP OF HIS CHISEL A LONG STONE WHICH HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN THE HEARTH BENEATH WHICH WAS A CAVITY OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH
HER ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA JAMES HAD PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD AND MISSUS ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO FULLERTON
HOWEVER I DISCOVERED THAT I SHOULD MERELY HAVE DROPPED INTO A SORT OF INNER COURT AND I THEREFORE RENOUNCED THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER AS TOO FULL OF RISK AND DANGER NEVERTHELESS I CAREFULLY PRESERVED MY LADDER
I NEVER WAS SO DECEIVED IN ANYONE'S CHARACTER IN MY LIFE BEFORE AMONG ALL THE GREAT VARIETY THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN AND STUDIED MY OWN DISAPPOINTMENT AND LOSS IN HER IS VERY GREAT BUT AS FOR POOR JAMES
WOULD IT BE TO PROMOTE HIS HAPPINESS TO ENABLE HIM TO MARRY SUCH A GIRL SHE MUST BE AN UNPRINCIPLED ONE OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE USED YOUR BROTHER SO AND HOW STRANGE AN INFATUATION ON FREDERICK'S SIDE A GIRL
I ONCE THOUGHT CONTINUED FARIA OF REMOVING THESE IRON BARS AND LETTING MYSELF DOWN FROM THE WINDOW WHICH AS YOU SEE IS SOMEWHAT WIDER THAN YOURS ALTHOUGH I SHOULD HAVE ENLARGED IT STILL MORE PREPARATORY TO MY FLIGHT
YOU WOULD NOT FOR INSTANCE NOW GO TO A BALL FOR THE WORLD YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NO LONGER ANY FRIEND TO WHOM YOU CAN SPEAK WITH UNRESERVE ON WHOSE REGARD YOU CAN PLACE DEPENDENCE OR WHOSE COUNSEL
AS THE WORKS OF THE SAVAGES IN THE SOUTH SEAS FROM WHENCE THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY THE DIFFERENT TRADING VESSELS AS FOR THE INK
AND EVEN OF THAT IF HARD PRESSED WOULD HAVE YIELDED THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN EXTREMITIES BUT IN THE CENTRAL PART OF ENGLAND THERE WAS SURELY SOME SECURITY FOR THE EXISTENCE EVEN OF A WIFE NOT BELOVED IN THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND THE MANNERS OF THE AGE
THEY PUT THE STONE BACK IN ITS PLACE THE ABBE SPRINKLED A LITTLE DUST OVER IT TO CONCEAL THE TRACES OF ITS HAVING BEEN REMOVED RUBBED HIS FOOT WELL ON IT TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE SAME APPEARANCE AS THE OTHER AND THEN GOING TOWARDS HIS BED
BUT PERHAPS OBSERVED CATHERINE THOUGH SHE HAS BEHAVED SO ILL BY OUR FAMILY SHE MAY BEHAVE BETTER BY YOURS NOW SHE HAS REALLY GOT THE MAN SHE LIKES SHE MAY BE CONSTANT
OF WHICH DANTES HAD WITNESSED THE COMPLETION AS HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER OF HIS FRIEND DANTES CAST AROUND ONE EAGER AND SEARCHING GLANCE IN QUEST OF THE EXPECTED MARVELS BUT NOTHING MORE THAN COMMON MET HIS VIEW IT IS WELL
HIS MARRYING MISS THORPE IS NOT PROBABLE I THINK YOU MUST BE DECEIVED SO FAR I AM VERY SORRY FOR MISTER MORLAND SORRY THAT ANYONE YOU LOVE SHOULD BE UNHAPPY BUT MY SURPRISE WOULD BE GREATER
INDEED I AM AFRAID SHE WILL REPLIED HENRY I AM AFRAID SHE WILL BE VERY CONSTANT UNLESS A BARONET SHOULD COME IN HER WAY THAT IS FREDERICK'S ONLY CHANCE I WILL GET THE BATH PAPER AND LOOK OVER THE ARRIVALS
NO I THANK YOU SIGHING AS SHE SPOKE THEY ARE ALL VERY WELL MY LETTER WAS FROM MY BROTHER AT OXFORD NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN SPEAKING THROUGH HER TEARS SHE ADDED
AND SHE DID NOT LOVE THE SIGHT OF JAPAN IN ANY SHAPE BUT EVEN SHE COULD ALLOW THAT AN OCCASIONAL MEMENTO OF PAST FOLLY HOWEVER PAINFUL MIGHT NOT BE WITHOUT USE
AND HER FACE SUDDENLY SOFTENED SHE SEEMED TO BE PULLING HERSELF TOGETHER FOR A FEW SECONDS AS THOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE WAS DOING AND GETTING UP RAPIDLY SHE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR WELL SHE LOVES MY CHILD HE THOUGHT
HE AT ONCE PERCEIVED IT AND BLUSHED TOO I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID SHE DID NOT SAY WE MUST DO OUR LESSONS BUT SHE SAID WE WERE TO GO FOR A WALK WITH MISS HOOLE TO GRANDMAMMA'S WELL GO TANYA MY DARLING OH WAIT A MINUTE THOUGH HE SAID
SHE HAD REFUSED TO SEE HER HUSBAND IT'S THAT IDIOTIC SMILE THAT'S TO BLAME FOR IT ALL THOUGHT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH BUT WHAT'S TO BE DONE WHAT'S TO BE DONE HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN DESPAIR
THE JOYOUS SMILE WAS EVOKED BY A GOOD DIGESTION BUT THIS JOYOUS SMILE AT ONCE RECALLED EVERYTHING TO HIM AND HE GREW THOUGHTFUL TWO CHILDISH VOICES STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH RECOGNIZED THE VOICES OF GRISHA HIS YOUNGEST BOY AND TANYA HIS ELDEST GIRL
HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN ADAPTING HIS FACE TO THE POSITION IN WHICH HE WAS PLACED TOWARDS HIS WIFE BY THE DISCOVERY OF HIS FAULT INSTEAD OF BEING HURT DENYING DEFENDING HIMSELF BEGGING FORGIVENESS INSTEAD OF REMAINING INDIFFERENT EVEN ANYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN WHAT HE DID DO
HAVING FINISHED THE PAPER A SECOND CUP OF COFFEE AND A ROLL AND BUTTER HE GOT UP SHAKING THE CRUMBS OF THE ROLL OFF HIS WAISTCOAT AND SQUARING HIS BROAD CHEST HE SMILED JOYOUSLY NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS ANYTHING PARTICULARLY AGREEABLE IN HIS MIND
WHICH WERE HELD ALSO BY MANY OF HIS CIRCLE IT AROSE NOT FROM HIS CONSIDERING LIBERALISM MORE RATIONAL BUT FROM ITS BEING IN CLOSER ACCORDANCE WITH HIS MANNER OF LIFE THE LIBERAL PARTY SAID THAT IN RUSSIA EVERYTHING IS WRONG
WITH PAIN AND WRATH SHE UTTERED THE WORD SO TERRIBLE TO HERSELF STRANGER HE LOOKED AT HER AND THE FURY EXPRESSED IN HER FACE ALARMED AND AMAZED HIM
SHOULD THEY HAVE ANY MILK SHOULD NOT A NEW COOK BE SENT FOR AH LET ME ALONE LET ME ALONE SHE SAID AND GOING BACK TO HER BEDROOM SHE SAT DOWN IN THE SAME PLACE AS SHE HAD SAT WHEN TALKING TO HER HUSBAND CLASPING TIGHTLY HER THIN HANDS WITH THE RINGS THAT SLIPPED DOWN ON HER BONY FINGERS
THREE DAYS AFTER THE QUARREL PRINCE STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH OBLONSKY
TURNING OUT HIS FEET THAT CARRIED HIS FULL FRAME SO EASILY HE PULLED UP THE BLIND AND RANG THE BELL LOUDLY IT WAS AT ONCE ANSWERED BY THE APPEARANCE OF AN OLD FRIEND
LET US SEND FOR MY BROTHER SHE SAID
DARYA ALEXANDROVNA IN A DRESSING JACKET AND WITH HER NOW SCANTY ONCE LUXURIANT AND BEAUTIFUL HAIR FASTENED UP WITH HAIRPINS ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WITH A SUNKEN THIN FACE AND LARGE STARTLED EYES
EH MATVEY HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD IT'S ALL RIGHT SIR SHE WILL COME ROUND SAID MATVEY COME ROUND YES SIR DO YOU THINK SO WHO'S THERE ASKED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HEARING THE RUSTLE OF A WOMAN'S DRESS AT THE DOOR IT'S I
AND THERE WERE SOME SORT OF LITTLE DECANTERS ON THE TABLE AND THEY WERE WOMEN TOO HE REMEMBERED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH'S EYES TWINKLED GAILY AND HE PONDERED WITH A SMILE YES IT WAS NICE VERY NICE
CAN WE LIVE TOGETHER IS THAT POSSIBLE TELL ME EH IS IT POSSIBLE SHE REPEATED RAISING HER VOICE AFTER MY HUSBAND THE FATHER OF MY CHILDREN ENTERS INTO A LOVE AFFAIR WITH HIS OWN CHILDREN'S GOVERNESS
AND HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO BE DONE
AND THE MOST AWFUL THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT'S ALL MY FAULT ALL MY FAULT THOUGH I'M NOT TO BLAME
AND GOING TO THE DOOR HE CALLED THEM THEY THREW DOWN THE BOX THAT REPRESENTED A TRAIN AND CAME IN TO THEIR FATHER THE LITTLE GIRL HER FATHER'S FAVORITE RAN UP BOLDLY EMBRACED HIM AND HUNG LAUGHINGLY ON HIS NECK
LAUGHING ONLY WITH HIS EYES AND PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS HE WATCHED HIS MASTER WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS SILENT A MINUTE THEN A GOOD HUMORED AND RATHER PITIFUL SMILE SHOWED ITSELF ON HIS HANDSOME FACE
BETRAYED BEWILDERMENT AND SUFFERING DOLLY HE SAID IN A SUBDUED AND TIMID VOICE HE BENT HIS HEAD TOWARDS HIS SHOULDER AND TRIED TO LOOK PITIFUL AND HUMBLE BUT FOR ALL THAT HE WAS RADIANT WITH FRESHNESS AND HEALTH
AND SAW HER AT LAST IN HER BEDROOM WITH THE UNLUCKY LETTER THAT REVEALED EVERYTHING IN HER HAND SHE HIS DOLLY FOREVER FUSSING AND WORRYING OVER HOUSEHOLD DETAILS AND LIMITED IN HER IDEAS AS HE CONSIDERED
AND TRYING ASSIDUOUSLY TO GIVE HER FEATURES A SEVERE AND CONTEMPTUOUS EXPRESSION SHE FELT SHE WAS AFRAID OF HIM AND AFRAID OF THE COMING INTERVIEW
THE MOST UNPLEASANT THING OF ALL WAS THAT HIS PECUNIARY INTERESTS SHOULD IN THIS WAY ENTER INTO THE QUESTION OF HIS RECONCILIATION WITH HIS WIFE AND THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE LED ON BY HIS INTERESTS THAT HE MIGHT SEEK A RECONCILIATION WITH HIS WIFE ON ACCOUNT OF THE SALE OF THE FOREST THAT IDEA HURT HIM
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS LETTERS STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH MOVED THE OFFICE PAPERS CLOSE TO HIM RAPIDLY LOOKED THROUGH TWO PIECES OF BUSINESS MADE A FEW NOTES WITH A BIG PENCIL AND PUSHING AWAY THE PAPERS TURNED TO HIS COFFEE AS HE SIPPED HIS COFFEE HE OPENED A STILL DAMP MORNING PAPER
STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS ALREADY WASHED AND COMBED AND READY TO BE DRESSED WHEN MATVEY STEPPING DELIBERATELY IN HIS CREAKY BOOTS
OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE PHRASES SHE HAD MORE THAN ONCE REPEATED TO HERSELF IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW DAYS SHE HAD CALLED HIM STIVA AND HE GLANCED AT HER WITH GRATITUDE AND MOVED TO TAKE HER HAND BUT SHE DREW BACK FROM HIM WITH AVERSION I THINK OF THE CHILDREN
TO SORT OUT THE CHILDREN'S THINGS AND HER OWN SO AS TO TAKE THEM TO HER MOTHER'S AND AGAIN SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO DO THIS BUT NOW AGAIN AS EACH TIME BEFORE SHE KEPT SAYING TO HERSELF THAT THINGS CANNOT GO ON LIKE THIS
AND CERTAINLY STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HAD MANY DEBTS AND WAS DECIDEDLY SHORT OF MONEY THE LIBERAL PARTY SAID THAT MARRIAGE IS AN INSTITUTION QUITE OUT OF DATE AND THAT IT NEEDS RECONSTRUCTION AND FAMILY LIFE CERTAINLY AFFORDED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH LITTLE GRATIFICATION
ONE MUST LIVE IN THE NEEDS OF THE DAY THAT IS FORGET ONESELF TO FORGET HIMSELF IN SLEEP WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOW AT LEAST TILL NIGHTTIME HE COULD NOT GO BACK NOW TO THE MUSIC SUNG BY THE DECANTER WOMEN SO HE MUST FORGET HIMSELF IN THE DREAM OF DAILY LIFE
AND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH COULD NOT GET THROUGH EVEN A SHORT SERVICE WITHOUT HIS LEGS ACHING FROM STANDING UP AND COULD NEVER MAKE OUT WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF ALL THE TERRIBLE AND HIGH FLOWN LANGUAGE ABOUT ANOTHER WORLD WHEN LIFE MIGHT BE SO VERY AMUSING IN THIS WORLD AND WITH ALL THIS
THIS IDIOTIC SMILE HE COULD NOT FORGIVE HIMSELF CATCHING SIGHT OF THAT SMILE DOLLY SHUDDERED AS THOUGH AT PHYSICAL PAIN BROKE OUT WITH HER CHARACTERISTIC HEAT INTO A FLOOD OF CRUEL WORDS AND RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM SINCE THEN
WERE HEARD OUTSIDE THE DOOR THEY WERE CARRYING SOMETHING AND DROPPED IT I TOLD YOU NOT TO SIT PASSENGERS ON THE ROOF SAID THE LITTLE GIRL IN ENGLISH THERE PICK THEM UP EVERYTHING'S IN CONFUSION THOUGHT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH THERE ARE THE CHILDREN RUNNING ABOUT BY THEMSELVES
THE WIFE HAD DISCOVERED THAT THE HUSBAND WAS CARRYING ON AN INTRIGUE WITH A FRENCH GIRL WHO HAD BEEN A GOVERNESS IN THEIR FAMILY AND SHE HAD ANNOUNCED TO HER HUSBAND THAT SHE COULD NOT GO ON LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM THIS POSITION OF AFFAIRS HAD NOW LASTED THREE DAYS
WELL WHAT IS THAT TO ME I CAN'T SEE HER SHE CRIED
THERE WAS A SOB IN HIS THROAT SHE SHUT THE BUREAU WITH A SLAM AND GLANCED AT HIM DOLLY WHAT CAN I SAY ONE THING FORGIVE REMEMBER CANNOT NINE YEARS OF MY LIFE ATONE FOR AN INSTANT SHE DROPPED HER EYES AND LISTENED
THERE WAS NO SOLUTION BUT THAT UNIVERSAL SOLUTION WHICH LIFE GIVES TO ALL QUESTIONS EVEN THE MOST COMPLEX AND INSOLUBLE
THEY'VE SENT FROM THE CARRIAGE JOBBERS STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH MADE NO REPLY HE MERELY GLANCED AT MATVEY IN THE LOOKING GLASS IN THE GLANCE IN WHICH THEIR EYES MET IN THE LOOKING GLASS IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH'S EYES ASKED
SHE COULD NOT GET OUT OF THE HABIT OF REGARDING HIM AS HER HUSBAND AND LOVING HIM BESIDES THIS SHE REALIZED THAT IF EVEN HERE IN HER OWN HOUSE SHE COULD HARDLY MANAGE TO LOOK AFTER HER FIVE CHILDREN PROPERLY THEY WOULD BE STILL WORSE OFF WHERE SHE WAS GOING WITH THEM ALL
AND NOT ONLY THE HUSBAND AND WIFE THEMSELVES BUT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLD WERE PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF IT EVERY PERSON IN THE HOUSE FELT THAT THERE WAS NO SENSE IN THEIR LIVING TOGETHER
THE WIDOW OF A STAFF CAPTAIN KALININ CAME WITH A REQUEST IMPOSSIBLE AND UNREASONABLE BUT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AS HE GENERALLY DID MADE HER SIT DOWN HEARD HER TO THE END ATTENTIVELY WITHOUT INTERRUPTING HER AND GAVE HER DETAILED ADVICE AS TO HOW AND TO WHOM TO APPLY
ARE THERE ANY PAPERS FROM THE OFFICE ASKED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH TAKING THE TELEGRAM AND SEATING HIMSELF AT THE LOOKING GLASS ON THE TABLE REPLIED MATVEY GLANCING WITH INQUIRING SYMPATHY AT HIS MASTER AND AFTER A SHORT PAUSE HE ADDED WITH A SLY SMILE
RECALLING EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED AND AGAIN EVERY DETAIL OF HIS QUARREL WITH HIS WIFE WAS PRESENT TO HIS IMAGINATION ALL THE HOPELESSNESS OF HIS POSITION AND WORST OF ALL HIS OWN FAULT YES SHE WON'T FORGIVE ME AND SHE CAN'T FORGIVE ME
STILL HOLDING HER AND STROKING HER SOFT LITTLE HAND HE TOOK OFF THE MANTELPIECE WHERE HE HAD PUT IT YESTERDAY A LITTLE BOX OF SWEETS AND GAVE HER TWO PICKING OUT HER FAVORITES A CHOCOLATE AND A FONDANT FOR GRISHA
WIPED HIS FACE SQUARED HIS CHEST AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM IT WAS FRIDAY AND IN THE DINING ROOM THE GERMAN WATCHMAKER WAS WINDING UP THE CLOCK STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH REMEMBERED HIS JOKE ABOUT THIS PUNCTUAL BALD WATCHMAKER
THAT SHE MUST TAKE SOME STEP TO PUNISH HIM PUT HIM TO SHAME AVENGE ON HIM SOME LITTLE PART AT LEAST OF THE SUFFERING HE HAD CAUSED HER SHE STILL CONTINUED TO TELL HERSELF THAT SHE SHOULD LEAVE HIM BUT SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE
A HANDSOME SUSCEPTIBLE MAN OF THIRTY FOUR WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE THE MOTHER OF FIVE LIVING AND TWO DEAD CHILDREN AND ONLY A YEAR YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF
DARYA ALEXANDROVNA MEANWHILE HAVING PACIFIED THE CHILD AND KNOWING FROM THE SOUND OF THE CARRIAGE THAT HE HAD GONE OFF WENT BACK AGAIN TO HER BEDROOM IT WAS HER SOLITARY REFUGE FROM THE HOUSEHOLD CARES WHICH
STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS A TRUTHFUL MAN IN HIS RELATIONS WITH HIMSELF HE WAS INCAPABLE OF DECEIVING HIMSELF AND PERSUADING HIMSELF THAT HE REPENTED OF HIS CONDUCT HE COULD NOT AT THIS DATE REPENT OF THE FACT THAT HE
GETTING MORE AND MORE HEATED YOUR TEARS MEAN NOTHING
TRANSLATED BY CONSTANCE GARNETT PART ONE CHAPTER ONE HAPPY FAMILIES ARE ALL ALIKE EVERY UNHAPPY FAMILY IS UNHAPPY IN ITS OWN WAY
ARRANGE EVERYTHING WITH DARYA IN THE SITTING ROOM FOR ANNA ARKADYEVNA HE SAID TO MATVEY WHEN HE CAME IN YES SIR STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH PUT ON HIS FUR COAT AND WENT OUT ONTO THE STEPS YOU WON'T DINE AT HOME SAID MATVEY SEEING HIM OFF
WHICH LOOKED PROMINENT FROM THE THINNESS OF HER FACE WAS STANDING AMONG A LITTER OF ALL SORTS OF THINGS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE ROOM BEFORE AN OPEN BUREAU FROM WHICH SHE WAS TAKING SOMETHING HEARING HER HUSBAND'S STEPS SHE STOPPED LOOKING TOWARDS THE DOOR
YOU HAVE NEITHER HEART NOR HONORABLE FEELING
SHE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO BEGIN TO SPEAK BUT COULD NOT HE WAITED YOU REMEMBER THE CHILDREN STIVA TO PLAY WITH THEM BUT I REMEMBER THEM AND KNOW THAT THIS MEANS THEIR RUIN SHE SAID
AND LET HER GO THE CARRIAGE IS READY SAID MATVEY BUT THERE'S SOME ONE TO SEE YOU WITH A PETITION BEEN HERE LONG ASKED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HALF AN HOUR HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU TO TELL ME AT ONCE
AND BEGAN READING IT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH TOOK IN AND READ A LIBERAL PAPER NOT AN EXTREME ONE BUT ONE ADVOCATING THE VIEWS HELD BY THE MAJORITY AND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT SCIENCE ART AND POLITICS HAD NO SPECIAL INTEREST FOR HIM
THAT THE GERMAN WAS WOUND UP FOR A WHOLE LIFETIME HIMSELF TO WIND UP WATCHES AND HE SMILED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS FOND OF A JOKE AND MAYBE SHE WILL COME ROUND THAT'S A GOOD EXPRESSION COME ROUND HE THOUGHT I MUST REPEAT THAT MATVEY HE SHOUTED
IN A RAPID GLANCE SHE SCANNED HIS FIGURE THAT BEAMED WITH HEALTH AND FRESHNESS YES HE IS HAPPY AND CONTENT SHE THOUGHT WHILE I AND THAT DISGUSTING GOOD NATURE WHICH EVERY ONE LIKES HIM FOR AND PRAISES I HATE THAT GOOD NATURE OF HIS SHE THOUGHT HER MOUTH STIFFENED
THAT NOTHING COULD COME OF IT BUT FALSITY THAT TO AMEND TO SET RIGHT THEIR RELATIONS WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HER ATTRACTIVE AGAIN AND ABLE TO INSPIRE LOVE OR TO MAKE HIM AN OLD MAN NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOVE EXCEPT DECEIT AND LYING NOTHING COULD COME OF IT NOW
ENJOYING AS SHE ALWAYS DID THE SMELL OF SCENT THAT CAME FROM HIS WHISKERS AT LAST THE LITTLE GIRL KISSED HIS FACE WHICH WAS FLUSHED FROM HIS STOOPING POSTURE AND BEAMING WITH TENDERNESS LOOSED HER HANDS AND WAS ABOUT TO RUN AWAY AGAIN BUT HER FATHER HELD HER BACK
AND SHE WENT OUT SLAMMING THE DOOR STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SIGHED WIPED HIS FACE AND WITH A SUBDUED TREAD WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM MATVEY SAYS SHE WILL COME ROUND BUT HOW I DON'T SEE THE LEAST CHANCE OF IT AH OH HOW HORRIBLE IT IS
BUT HE FELT ALL THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION AND WAS SORRY FOR HIS WIFE HIS CHILDREN AND HIMSELF
IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN NOTHING EXCEPT WHAT HE WANTED TO FORGET HIS WIFE AH YES HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND HIS HANDSOME FACE ASSUMED A HARASSED EXPRESSION TO GO OR NOT TO GO HE SAID TO HIMSELF
WAS NOT SO MUCH ANNOYED AT THE FACT ITSELF AS AT THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD MET HIS WIFE'S WORDS THERE HAPPENED TO HIM AT THAT INSTANT WHAT DOES HAPPEN TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE UNEXPECTEDLY CAUGHT IN SOMETHING VERY DISGRACEFUL
AND EVEN WROTE HER IN HIS LARGE SPRAWLING GOOD AND LEGIBLE HAND A CONFIDENT AND FLUENT LITTLE NOTE TO A PERSONAGE WHO MIGHT BE OF USE TO HER HAVING GOT RID OF THE STAFF CAPTAIN'S WIDOW STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH TOOK HIS HAT AND STOPPED TO RECOLLECT WHETHER HE HAD FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
SAID A FIRM PLEASANT WOMAN'S VOICE AND THE STERN POCKMARKED FACE OF MATRONA PHILIMONOVNA THE NURSE WAS THRUST IN AT THE DOORWAY WELL WHAT IS IT MATRONA QUERIED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH
THAT'S AS IT HAPPENS BUT HERE'S FOR THE HOUSEKEEPING HE SAID TAKING TEN ROUBLES FROM HIS POCKETBOOK THAT'LL BE ENOUGH ENOUGH OR NOT ENOUGH WE MUST MAKE IT DO SAID MATVEY SLAMMING THE CARRIAGE DOOR AND STEPPING BACK ONTO THE STEPS
ALTHOUGH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS COMPLETELY IN THE WRONG AS REGARDS HIS WIFE AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF THIS HIMSELF ALMOST EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE EVEN THE NURSE DARYA ALEXANDROVNA'S CHIEF ALLY WAS ON HIS SIDE
HE FIRMLY HELD THOSE VIEWS ON ALL THESE SUBJECTS WHICH WERE HELD BY THE MAJORITY AND BY HIS PAPER AND HE ONLY CHANGED THEM WHEN THE MAJORITY CHANGED THEM OR MORE STRICTLY SPEAKING HE DID NOT CHANGE THEM BUT THEY IMPERCEPTIBLY CHANGED OF THEMSELVES WITHIN HIM
HOW WELL WE GOT ON SHE WAS CONTENTED AND HAPPY IN HER CHILDREN I NEVER INTERFERED WITH HER IN ANYTHING I LET HER MANAGE THE CHILDREN AND THE HOUSE JUST AS SHE LIKED IT'S TRUE IT'S BAD HER HAVING BEEN A GOVERNESS IN OUR HOUSE THAT'S BAD THERE'S SOMETHING COMMON
THE MUSCLES OF THE CHEEK CONTRACTED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HER PALE NERVOUS FACE WHAT DO YOU WANT SHE SAID IN A RAPID DEEP UNNATURAL VOICE DOLLY HE REPEATED WITH A QUIVER IN HIS VOICE
VULGAR IN FLIRTING WITH ONE'S GOVERNESS BUT WHAT A GOVERNESS
AND DECEIT AND LYING WERE OPPOSED TO HIS NATURE IT MUST BE SOME TIME THOUGH IT CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS HE SAID TRYING TO GIVE HIMSELF COURAGE
WHEN HE WAS DRESSED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SPRINKLED SOME SCENT ON HIMSELF PULLED DOWN HIS SHIRT CUFFS DISTRIBUTED INTO HIS POCKETS HIS CIGARETTES POCKETBOOK MATCHES AND WATCH WITH ITS DOUBLE CHAIN AND SEALS AND SHAKING OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF
MATVEY MY SISTER ANNA ARKADYEVNA WILL BE HERE TOMORROW HE SAID CHECKING FOR A MINUTE THE SLEEK PLUMP HAND OF THE BARBER CUTTING A PINK PATH THROUGH HIS LONG CURLY WHISKERS THANK GOD SAID MATVEY SHOWING BY THIS RESPONSE THAT HE LIKE HIS MASTER
AND NOW DON'T I LOVE HIM DON'T I LOVE HIM MORE THAN BEFORE THE MOST HORRIBLE THING IS SHE BEGAN BUT DID NOT FINISH HER THOUGHT
A PRESENT ON HIS LAST BIRTHDAY WORKED FOR HIM BY HIS WIFE ON GOLD COLORED MOROCCO AND AS HE HAD DONE EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND WITHOUT GETTING UP TOWARDS THE PLACE WHERE HIS DRESSING GOWN ALWAYS HUNG IN HIS BEDROOM
AND GETTING UP HE PUT ON A GRAY DRESSING GOWN LINED WITH BLUE SILK TIED THE TASSELS IN A KNOT AND DRAWING A DEEP BREATH OF AIR INTO HIS BROAD BARE CHEST HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW WITH HIS USUAL CONFIDENT STEP
AND OPENED HIS EYES YES YES HOW WAS IT NOW HE THOUGHT GOING OVER HIS DREAM NOW HOW WAS IT TO BE SURE ALABIN WAS GIVING A DINNER AT DARMSTADT NO NOT DARMSTADT BUT SOMETHING AMERICAN YES BUT THEN DARMSTADT WAS IN AMERICA YES
COME THAT'LL DO YOU CAN GO SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH BLUSHING SUDDENLY WELL NOW DO DRESS ME HE TURNED TO MATVEY AND THREW OFF HIS DRESSING GOWN DECISIVELY
A WORN OUT WOMAN NO LONGER YOUNG OR GOOD LOOKING AND IN NO WAY REMARKABLE OR INTERESTING MERELY A GOOD MOTHER OUGHT FROM A SENSE OF FAIRNESS TO TAKE AN INDULGENT VIEW IT HAD TURNED OUT QUITE THE OTHER WAY OH IT'S AWFUL
WHY DO YOU TELL ME THAT DON'T YOU KNOW MATVEY PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS JACKET POCKETS THRUST OUT ONE LEG AND GAZED SILENTLY GOOD HUMOREDLY WITH A FAINT SMILE AT HIS MASTER I TOLD THEM TO COME ON SUNDAY AND TILL THEN NOT TO TROUBLE YOU OR THEMSELVES FOR NOTHING HE SAID
FEELING HIMSELF CLEAN FRAGRANT HEALTHY AND PHYSICALLY AT EASE IN SPITE OF HIS UNHAPPINESS HE WALKED WITH A SLIGHT SWING ON EACH LEG INTO THE DINING ROOM WHERE COFFEE WAS ALREADY WAITING FOR HIM AND BESIDE THE COFFEE LETTERS AND PAPERS FROM THE OFFICE
LIVING IN A CERTAIN SOCIETY OWING TO THE NEED ORDINARILY DEVELOPED AT YEARS OF DISCRETION FOR SOME DEGREE OF MENTAL ACTIVITY TO HAVE VIEWS WAS JUST AS INDISPENSABLE AS TO HAVE A HAT IF THERE WAS A REASON FOR HIS PREFERRING LIBERAL TO CONSERVATIVE VIEWS
AS IT WAS EVEN IN THE COURSE OF THESE THREE DAYS THE YOUNGEST WAS UNWELL FROM BEING GIVEN UNWHOLESOME SOUP AND THE OTHERS HAD ALMOST GONE WITHOUT THEIR DINNER THE DAY BEFORE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GO AWAY BUT CHEATING HERSELF SHE WENT ON ALL THE SAME SORTING OUT HER THINGS
HIS FACE UTTERLY INVOLUNTARILY REFLEX SPINAL ACTION REFLECTED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WHO WAS FOND OF PHYSIOLOGY UTTERLY INVOLUNTARILY ASSUMED ITS HABITUAL GOOD HUMORED AND THEREFORE IDIOTIC SMILE
THE CHILDREN RAN WILD ALL OVER THE HOUSE THE ENGLISH GOVERNESS QUARRELED WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER AND WROTE TO A FRIEND ASKING HER TO LOOK OUT FOR A NEW SITUATION FOR HER THE MAN COOK HAD WALKED OFF THE DAY BEFORE JUST AT DINNER TIME THE KITCHEN MAID AND THE COACHMAN
DARYA ALEXANDROVNA MATVEY REPEATED AS THOUGH IN DOUBT YES INFORM HER HERE TAKE THE TELEGRAM GIVE IT TO HER AND THEN DO WHAT SHE TELLS YOU YOU WANT TO TRY IT ON MATVEY UNDERSTOOD BUT HE ONLY SAID YES SIR
WOKE UP AT HIS USUAL HOUR THAT IS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING NOT IN HIS WIFE'S BEDROOM BUT ON THE LEATHER COVERED SOFA IN HIS STUDY HE TURNED OVER HIS STOUT WELL CARED FOR PERSON ON THE SPRINGY SOFA AS THOUGH HE WOULD SINK INTO A LONG SLEEP AGAIN
BUT TODAY THAT SATISFACTION WAS EMBITTERED BY MATRONA PHILIMONOVNA'S ADVICE AND THE UNSATISFACTORY STATE OF THE HOUSEHOLD
AS HE REMEMBERED THE ACUTELY PAINFUL SENSATIONS CAUSED HIM BY THIS QUARREL MOST UNPLEASANT OF ALL WAS THE FIRST MINUTE WHEN ON COMING HAPPY AND GOOD HUMORED FROM THE THEATER WITH A HUGE PEAR IN HIS HAND FOR HIS WIFE HE HAD NOT FOUND HIS WIFE IN THE DRAWING ROOM
BUT DOLLY FORGIVE ME SHE SAT DOWN HE LISTENED TO HER HARD HEAVY BREATHING
WAS SITTING PERFECTLY STILL WITH THE LETTER IN HER HAND LOOKING AT HIM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF HORROR DESPAIR AND INDIGNATION WHAT'S THIS THIS SHE ASKED POINTING TO THE LETTER AND AT THIS RECOLLECTION STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE
EXPECTING WHAT HE WOULD SAY AS IT WERE BESEECHING HIM IN SOME WAY OR OTHER TO MAKE HER BELIEVE DIFFERENTLY INSTANT OF PASSION HE SAID AND WOULD HAVE GONE ON BUT AT THAT WORD AS AT A PANG OF PHYSICAL PAIN HER LIPS STIFFENED AGAIN
BUT AFTER ALL WHILE SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE I KEPT MYSELF IN HAND AND THE WORST OF IT ALL IS THAT SHE'S ALREADY IT SEEMS AS IF ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT SO
STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HAD NOT CHOSEN HIS POLITICAL OPINIONS OR HIS VIEWS THESE POLITICAL OPINIONS AND VIEWS HAD COME TO HIM OF THEMSELVES JUST AS HE DID NOT CHOOSE THE SHAPES OF HIS HAT AND COAT BUT SIMPLY TOOK THOSE THAT WERE BEING WORN AND FOR HIM
HOW IS MAMMA HE ASKED PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS DAUGHTER'S SMOOTH SOFT LITTLE NECK GOOD MORNING HE SAID SMILING TO THE BOY WHO HAD COME UP TO GREET HIM HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE LOVED THE BOY LESS AND ALWAYS TRIED TO BE FAIR BUT THE BOY FELT IT
SEEING HER HUSBAND SHE DROPPED HER HANDS INTO THE DRAWER OF THE BUREAU AS THOUGH LOOKING FOR SOMETHING AND ONLY LOOKED ROUND AT HIM WHEN HE HAD COME QUITE UP TO HER BUT HER FACE TO WHICH SHE TRIED TO GIVE A SEVERE AND RESOLUTE EXPRESSION
GO TO HER SIR OWN YOUR FAULT AGAIN MAYBE GOD WILL AID YOU SHE IS SUFFERING SO IT'S SAD TO SEE HER
STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH COULD NOT ANSWER AS THE BARBER WAS AT WORK ON HIS UPPER LIP AND HE RAISED ONE FINGER MATVEY NODDED AT THE LOOKING GLASS ALONE IS THE ROOM TO BE GOT READY UPSTAIRS INFORM DARYA ALEXANDROVNA WHERE SHE ORDERS
AND HOW VULGARLY SHE SHOUTED HE SAID TO HIMSELF REMEMBERING HER SHRIEK AND THE WORDS SCOUNDREL AND MISTRESS AND VERY LIKELY THE MAIDS WERE LISTENING HORRIBLY VULGAR HORRIBLE STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH STOOD A FEW SECONDS ALONE
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL MORE THAT WAS DELIGHTFUL ONLY THERE'S NO PUTTING IT INTO WORDS OR EVEN EXPRESSING IT IN ONE'S THOUGHTS AWAKE AND NOTICING A GLEAM OF LIGHT PEEPING IN BESIDE ONE OF THE SERGE CURTAINS HE CHEERFULLY DROPPED HIS FEET OVER THE EDGE OF THE SOFA AND FELT ABOUT WITH THEM FOR HIS SLIPPERS
AND DROPPED SOME INNUENDOES REFLECTING ON THE MINISTRY WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC QUICKWITTEDNESS HE CAUGHT THE DRIFT OF EACH INNUENDO DIVINED WHENCE IT CAME AT WHOM AND ON WHAT GROUND IT WAS AIMED AND THAT AFFORDED HIM AS IT ALWAYS DID A CERTAIN SATISFACTION
EVEN IF WE REMAIN IN THE SAME HOUSE WE ARE STRANGERS STRANGERS FOREVER SHE REPEATED AGAIN WITH SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE THE WORD SO DREADFUL TO HER AND HOW I LOVED HIM MY GOD HOW I LOVED HIM HOW I LOVED HIM
AND FOR THAT REASON I WOULD DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD TO SAVE THEM BUT I DON'T MYSELF KNOW HOW TO SAVE THEM BY TAKING THEM AWAY FROM THEIR FATHER OR BY LEAVING THEM WITH A VICIOUS FATHER YES A VICIOUS FATHER TELL ME AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED
AND HE LIKED HIS NEWSPAPER AS HE DID HIS CIGAR AFTER DINNER FOR THE SLIGHT FOG IT DIFFUSED IN HIS BRAIN HE READ THE LEADING ARTICLE IN WHICH IT WAS MAINTAINED THAT IT WAS QUITE SENSELESS IN OUR DAY TO RAISE AN OUTCRY THAT RADICALISM WAS THREATENING TO SWALLOW UP ALL CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS
AS THOUGH THIS SHRIEK WERE CALLED UP BY PHYSICAL PAIN STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH COULD BE CALM WHEN HE THOUGHT OF HIS WIFE HE COULD HOPE THAT SHE WOULD COME ROUND AS MATVEY EXPRESSED IT AND COULD QUIETLY GO ON READING HIS PAPER AND DRINKING HIS COFFEE BUT WHEN HE SAW HER TORTURED SUFFERING FACE
HE HAD OBVIOUSLY PREPARED THE SENTENCE BEFOREHAND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SAW MATVEY WANTED TO MAKE A JOKE AND ATTRACT ATTENTION TO HIMSELF TEARING OPEN THE TELEGRAM HE READ IT THROUGH GUESSING AT THE WORDS MISSPELT AS THEY ALWAYS ARE IN TELEGRAMS AND HIS FACE BRIGHTENED
HIS LIPS SWELLED HIS EYES WERE SWIMMING WITH TEARS DOLLY HE SAID SOBBING NOW FOR MERCY'S SAKE THINK OF THE CHILDREN THEY ARE NOT TO BLAME I AM TO BLAME AND PUNISH ME MAKE ME EXPIATE MY FAULT ANYTHING I CAN DO I AM READY TO DO ANYTHING
HE VIGOROUSLY EMBRACED THE PILLOW ON THE OTHER SIDE AND BURIED HIS FACE IN IT BUT ALL AT ONCE HE JUMPED UP
HE READ THE LETTERS ONE WAS VERY UNPLEASANT FROM A MERCHANT WHO WAS BUYING A FOREST ON HIS WIFE'S PROPERTY TO SELL THIS FOREST WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL BUT AT PRESENT UNTIL HE WAS RECONCILED WITH HIS WIFE THE SUBJECT COULD NOT BE DISCUSSED
VERY WELL I WILL COME DIRECTLY AND SEE ABOUT IT BUT DID YOU SEND FOR SOME NEW MILK
AND THAT ONE NEED HAVE NO MORE GRAY HAIR AND OF THE SALE OF A LIGHT CARRIAGE AND OF A YOUNG PERSON SEEKING A SITUATION BUT THESE ITEMS OF INFORMATION DID NOT GIVE HIM AS USUAL A QUIET IRONICAL GRATIFICATION
SAID THE LITTLE GIRL POINTING TO THE CHOCOLATE YES YES
REALIZED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS ARRIVAL THAT IS THAT ANNA ARKADYEVNA THE SISTER HE WAS SO FOND OF MIGHT BRING ABOUT A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE ALONE OR WITH HER HUSBAND INQUIRED MATVEY
AND THAT THE STRAY PEOPLE BROUGHT TOGETHER BY CHANCE IN ANY INN HAD MORE IN COMMON WITH ONE ANOTHER THAN THEY THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLD OF THE OBLONSKYS THE WIFE DID NOT LEAVE HER OWN ROOM THE HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN AT HOME FOR THREE DAYS
NOTICING THE CHANGE OF HER FACE AT THE CHILD'S CRY MY CHILD HOW CAN SHE HATE ME DOLLY ONE WORD MORE HE SAID FOLLOWING HER IF YOU COME NEAR ME I WILL CALL IN THE SERVANTS THE CHILDREN THEY MAY ALL KNOW YOU ARE A SCOUNDREL I AM GOING AWAY AT ONCE AND YOU MAY LIVE HERE WITH YOUR MISTRESS
MONSIEUR I FOLLOWED THEM FROM CURIOSITY SO THAT I SAW THE COMBAT WITHOUT THE COMBATANTS SEEING ME AND WHAT TOOK PLACE OH THE AFFAIR WAS NOT LONG I ASSURE YOU THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON GUARD
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS UPON THE MOST CONSPICUOUS DOOR OF THE CORRIDOR WAS TRACED IN BLACK INK A GIGANTIC NUMBER ONE D'ARTAGNAN KNOCKED AND UPON THE BIDDING TO COME IN WHICH CAME FROM INSIDE HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER
DRESSED WITH A DOZEN YOUNG AND TENDER SPRING CHICKENS AFTER THE HARE HE ORDERED SOME PARTRIDGES A FEW PHEASANTS A COUPLE OF RABBITS AND A DOZEN FROGS AND LIZARDS THAT WAS ALL HE FELT ILL HE SAID AND COULD NOT EAT ANOTHER BITE
NOW I TRAVEL A GREAT DEAL PARTICULARLY ON THIS ROAD AND I WISH TO SEE ALL INNKEEPERS MAKING A FORTUNE IT SEEMS TO ME SAID THE HOST THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF SEEING MONSIEUR BAH I HAVE PASSED PERHAPS TEN TIMES THROUGH CHANTILLY
I WILL SEE THE QUEEN I WILL RELATE TO HER THE DETAILS OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS POOR WOMAN OF WHICH SHE IS NO DOUBT IGNORANT THESE DETAILS WILL GUIDE HER ON HER PART AND ON YOUR RETURN I SHALL PERHAPS HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS TO TELL YOU RELY ON ME
WILLINGLY SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHILE PORTHOS AND MOUSQUETON WERE BREAKFASTING WITH THE APPETITES OF CONVALESCENTS AND WITH THAT BROTHERLY CORDIALITY WHICH UNITES MEN IN MISFORTUNE D'ARTAGNAN RELATED HOW ARAMIS BEING WOUNDED WAS OBLIGED TO STOP AT CREVECOEUR
WHEREAS THE STRANGER ON THE CONTRARY IN SPITE OF ALL HIS RODOMONTADES QUICKLY THREW HIM ON HIS BACK AS MONSIEUR PORTHOS IS A VERY BOASTFUL MAN HE INSISTS THAT NOBODY SHALL KNOW HE HAS RECEIVED THIS WOUND EXCEPT THE DUCHESS
WAS BONACIEUX HIMSELF THE HUSBAND HAD PRESIDED AT THE ABDUCTION OF HIS WIFE A TERRIBLE INCLINATION SEIZED D'ARTAGNAN TO GRASP THE MERCER BY THE THROAT AND STRANGLE HIM BUT AS WE HAVE SAID
ALL LIGHT WHOLESOME FOOD SUITABLE FOR THE SICK BUT THE WINE SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHO FURNISHES THE WINE YOUR HOST THAT IS TO SAY YES AND NO HOW YES AND NO
AND WHAT WAS THE END OF THIS WORTHY MAN ASKED D'ARTAGNAN OH OF THE MOST UNFORTUNATE KIND MONSIEUR ONE DAY HE WAS SURPRISED IN A LONELY ROAD BETWEEN A HUGUENOT AND A CATHOLIC WITH BOTH OF WHOM HE HAD BEFORE HAD BUSINESS
THEN A SUDDEN IDEA CROSSED THE MIND OF D'ARTAGNAN THAT LITTLE STOUT MAN SHORT AND ELDERLY THAT SORT OF LACKEY DRESSED IN DARK CLOTHES TREATED WITHOUT CEREMONY BY THE MEN WEARING SWORDS WHO COMPOSED THE ESCORT
SO SO REPLIED PORTHOS ONLY THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO THE IMPERTINENT JACKANAPES GAVE ME HIS BILL AND I WAS FORCED TO TURN BOTH HIM AND HIS BILL OUT OF THE DOOR SO THAT I AM HERE
NO FATHER I HAVE NO ONE HOW CAN YOU EXIST THUS WITHOUT ANY ONE TO ATTACH YOU TO LIFE IT IS NOT MY FAULT MADAME AT MALTA I LOVED A YOUNG GIRL WAS ON THE POINT OF MARRYING HER
THIS WAS FULFILLING THE INTENTIONS OF MONSIEUR PORTHOS WHO HAD DESIRED US TO BE SO CAREFUL OF THIS LETTER WAS IT NOT NEARLY SO WELL MONSIEUR DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS GREAT LADY IS NO I HAVE HEARD PORTHOS SPEAK OF HER
YES MONSIEUR IN THIS HOUSE AND WE ARE EVEN A LITTLE UNEASY ON WHAT ACCOUNT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES HE HAS CONTRACTED WELL BUT WHATEVER EXPENSES HE MAY HAVE INCURRED I AM SURE HE IS IN A CONDITION TO PAY THEM
I PUT MY FOOT ON A STONE SLIPPED AND STRAINED MY KNEE TRULY HONOR
HE ACCEPTED MY CHALLENGE AND MY FAITH MY SEVENTY FIVE PISTOLES PASSED FROM MY POCKET TO HIS WITHOUT RECKONING MY HORSE WHICH HE WON INTO THE BARGAIN BUT YOU MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT MY DEAR PORTHOS
THE HOST ON SEEING A YOUNG MAN FOLLOWED BY A LACKEY WITH TWO EXTRA HORSES ADVANCED RESPECTFULLY TO THE DOOR NOW AS THEY HAD ALREADY TRAVELED ELEVEN LEAGUES D'ARTAGNAN THOUGHT IT TIME TO STOP
AND IN FRANCE ETERNAL FRIENDSHIPS ARE AS RARE AS THE CUSTOM OF DIVIDING BREAD AND SALT WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT SAID THE COUNTESS BREATHLESSLY WITH HER EYES FIXED ON MONTE CRISTO WHOSE ARM SHE CONVULSIVELY PRESSED WITH BOTH HANDS WE ARE FRIENDS ARE WE NOT
PINOCCHIO ATE LEAST OF ALL HE ASKED FOR A BITE OF BREAD AND A FEW NUTS AND THEN HARDLY TOUCHED THEM THE POOR FELLOW WITH HIS MIND ON THE FIELD OF WONDERS WAS SUFFERING FROM A GOLD PIECE INDIGESTION
IN FACT IN ADDITION TO THAT YELLOW SICKLY PALENESS WHICH INDICATES THE INSINUATION OF THE BILE IN THE BLOOD AND WHICH MIGHT BESIDES BE ACCIDENTAL
YOU SAID THAT PORTHOS HAD RECEIVED A SWORD CUT YES BUT HE HAS FORBIDDEN ME SO STRICTLY TO SAY SO AND WHY SO ZOUNDS MONSIEUR BECAUSE HE HAD BOASTED THAT HE WOULD PERFORATE THE STRANGER WITH WHOM YOU LEFT HIM IN DISPUTE
THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO HAVE ANY DOUBTS UPON THE SUPERIORITY OF OUR HOLY RELIGION FOR MY PART MONSIEUR I AM CATHOLIC MY FATHER FAITHFUL TO HIS PRINCIPLES HAVING MADE MY ELDER BROTHER A HUGUENOT
JUST AS PINOCCHIO STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE A HANDFUL OF THEM HE WAS AWAKENED BY THREE LOUD KNOCKS AT THE DOOR IT WAS THE INNKEEPER WHO HAD COME TO TELL HIM THAT MIDNIGHT HAD STRUCK ARE MY FRIENDS READY THE MARIONETTE ASKED HIM
I MUST ALLOW AS YOU SAY YOUR FATHER WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT FELLOW AND YOU SAY IN HIS LEISURE MOMENTS THE WORTHY MAN WAS A POACHER YES MONSIEUR AND IT WAS HE WHO TAUGHT ME TO LAY A SNARE AND GROUND A LINE THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WHEN I SAW OUR LABORERS
AH BUT YOU ARE JOKING MY WORTHY MAN SAID D'ARTAGNAN IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IF MY BOOTS NEED A SPONGE YOUR STOCKINGS AND SHOES STAND IN EQUAL NEED OF A BRUSH MAY YOU NOT HAVE BEEN PHILANDERING A LITTLE ALSO MONSIEUR BONACIEUX
THE COUNT BECAME PALE AS DEATH THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HIS HEART AND THEN AGAIN RISING DYED HIS CHEEKS WITH CRIMSON HIS EYES SWAM LIKE THOSE OF A MAN SUDDENLY DAZZLED CERTAINLY WE ARE FRIENDS HE REPLIED WHY SHOULD WE NOT BE
AND GATHERED A BUNCH OF MUSCATEL GRAPES SEE COUNT SHE SAID WITH A SMILE SO SAD IN ITS EXPRESSION THAT ONE COULD ALMOST DETECT THE TEARS ON HER EYELIDS SEE OUR FRENCH GRAPES ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED I KNOW WITH YOURS OF SICILY AND CYPRUS
A MAGNIFICENT PEACH WAS HANGING AGAINST AN ADJOINING WALL RIPENED BY THE SAME ARTIFICIAL HEAT MERCEDES DREW NEAR AND PLUCKED THE FRUIT TAKE THIS PEACH THEN SHE SAID THE COUNT AGAIN REFUSED WHAT AGAIN
MADAME I NEVER EAT MUSCATEL GRAPES REPLIED MONTE CRISTO AS IF THE SUBJECT HAD NOT BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE THE COUNTESS DASHED THE GRAPES INTO THE NEAREST THICKET WITH A GESTURE OF DESPAIR INFLEXIBLE MAN SHE MURMURED
ADDED HE LOOKING AT D'ARTAGNAN WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF UNEASINESS YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME NO
AND YET SAID D'ARTAGNAN LAUGHING IT APPEARS TO ME THAT FROM TIME TO TIME YOU MUST MAKE SORTIES AND HE AGAIN POINTED TO THE BOTTLES AND THE STEWPANS NOT I UNFORTUNATELY SAID PORTHOS THIS MISERABLE STRAIN CONFINES ME TO MY BED
MY FRIEND PLACED A BOTTLE AT THE DISTANCE OF THIRTY PACES AND AT EACH CAST HE CAUGHT THE NECK OF THE BOTTLE IN HIS RUNNING NOOSE I PRACTICED THIS EXERCISE AND AS NATURE HAS ENDOWED ME WITH SOME FACULTIES AT THIS DAY I CAN THROW THE LASSO WITH ANY MAN IN THE WORLD WELL
BEFORE STARTING OUT WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE NAP REMEMBER TO CALL US AT MIDNIGHT SHARP FOR WE MUST CONTINUE ON OUR JOURNEY YES SIR ANSWERED THE INNKEEPER WINKING IN A KNOWING WAY AT THE FOX AND THE CAT AS IF TO SAY I UNDERSTAND
WELL YOU SEE MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WITH WHAT ILL LUCK I PLAY REPLIED PORTHOS WITH THE MOST CARELESS AIR IN THE WORLD I WROTE TO HER TO SEND ME FIFTY LOUIS OR SO
YOUR LORDSHIP MUST HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY WHY TO BE SURE HE PROMISED TO REJOIN US AND WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF HIM HE HAS DONE US THE HONOR TO REMAIN HERE WHAT HE HAD DONE YOU THE HONOR TO REMAIN HERE
AND WHAT HAS BECAME OF HIM OH I DON'T KNOW HE HAD ENOUGH AND SET OFF WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE REST BUT YOU MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU SO THAT THIS STRAIN OF THE KNEE CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN MY DEAR PORTHOS KEEPS YOU IN BED
AND HAVE YOU FORGIVEN HER FOR ALL SHE HAS MADE YOU SUFFER HER YES BUT ONLY HER
DON'T BE AFRAID HE IS NOT SO MUCH OF A DEVIL AS HE APPEARS
WITHOUT ASKING INFORMATION OF ANY KIND ALIGHTED COMMENDED THE HORSES TO THE CARE OF HIS LACKEY
WHO ALTHOUGH SHE IS AT LEAST FIFTY STILL GIVES HERSELF JEALOUS AIRS
AS HE WAS SO IN NEED OF STRENGTH HE HAD TO HAVE FOUR MORE HELPINGS OF BUTTER AND CHEESE THE FOX AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF COAXING TRIED HIS BEST TO EAT A LITTLE THE DOCTOR HAD PUT HIM ON A DIET AND HE HAD TO BE SATISFIED WITH A SMALL HARE
PINOCCHIO PAID A GOLD PIECE FOR THE THREE SUPPERS AND STARTED ON HIS WAY TOWARD THE FIELD THAT WAS TO MAKE HIM A RICH MAN HE WALKED ON NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS GOING FOR IT WAS DARK SO DARK THAT NOT A THING WAS VISIBLE
HAPPINESS COMES TO MEET HIM DOES IT NOT MONSIEUR BONACIEUX BONACIEUX BECAME AS PALE AS DEATH AND GRINNED A GHASTLY SMILE AH AH SAID BONACIEUX YOU ARE A JOCULAR COMPANION
AS SOON AS PINOCCHIO WAS IN BED HE FELL FAST ASLEEP AND BEGAN TO DREAM HE DREAMED HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD THE FIELD WAS FULL OF VINES HEAVY WITH GRAPES
AND COMMENCED THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION MY FAITH MY GOOD HOST SAID D'ARTAGNAN FILLING THE TWO GLASSES
IT IS A WOUND THAT CONFINES HIM TO HIS BED AH AND A MASTER STROKE TOO I ASSURE YOU YOUR FRIEND'S SOUL MUST STICK TIGHT TO HIS BODY WERE YOU THERE THEN
BUT STEPPED BACK DO YOU REFUSE SAID MERCEDES IN A TREMULOUS VOICE PRAY EXCUSE ME MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BUT I NEVER EAT MUSCATEL GRAPES MERCEDES LET THEM FALL AND SIGHED
AND THAT SHE WAS SURE IT WAS FOR SOME WOMAN HE HAD RECEIVED THIS WOUND HAS HE BEEN WOUNDED THEN OH GOOD LORD
REJOICING TO THE SMELL IN ADDITION TO THIS HE PERCEIVED THAT THE TOP OF A WARDROBE AND THE MARBLE OF A COMMODE WERE COVERED WITH EMPTY BOTTLES AT THE SIGHT OF HIS FRIEND PORTHOS UTTERED A LOUD CRY OF JOY
WHO GOES THERE WHO GOES AS HE WALKED PINOCCHIO NOTICED A TINY INSECT GLIMMERING ON THE TRUNK OF A TREE A SMALL BEING THAT GLOWED WITH A PALE SOFT LIGHT WHO ARE YOU HE ASKED I AM THE GHOST OF THE TALKING CRICKET
A MAN IS NOT PRIVILEGED IN ALL WAYS SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU KNOW THE PROVERB UNLUCKY AT PLAY LUCKY IN LOVE
HE ASSISTED HIM TO RISE BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE HOTEL MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND DISAPPEARED SO IT WAS WITH MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN THIS STRANGER MEANT TO QUARREL IT APPEARS SO
REMEMBER THAT BOYS WHO INSIST ON HAVING THEIR OWN WAY SOONER OR LATER COME TO GRIEF THE SAME NONSENSE GOOD BY CRICKET GOOD NIGHT PINOCCHIO AND MAY HEAVEN PRESERVE YOU FROM THE ASSASSINS THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MINUTE
BUT THERE THE CONFIDENCE OF D'ARTAGNAN STOPPED HE ONLY ADDED THAT ON HIS RETURN FROM GREAT BRITAIN HE HAD BROUGHT BACK FOUR MAGNIFICENT HORSES
HOW COULD THEY DO SUCH A THING BEING PEOPLE OF GREAT REFINEMENT THEY DID NOT WANT TO OFFEND YOU SO DEEPLY AS NOT TO ALLOW YOU THE HONOR OF PAYING THE BILL TOO BAD
THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL ARABIAN CUSTOM WHICH MAKES ETERNAL FRIENDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE TOGETHER EATEN BREAD AND SALT UNDER THE SAME ROOF I KNOW IT MADAME REPLIED THE COUNT BUT WE ARE IN FRANCE AND NOT IN ARABIA
I HATE THEM NOT AT ALL WHY SHOULD I THE COUNTESS PLACED HERSELF BEFORE MONTE CRISTO STILL HOLDING IN HER HAND A PORTION OF THE PERFUMED GRAPES TAKE SOME SHE SAID
ALL FALSEHOOD IS A MASK AND HOWEVER WELL MADE THE MASK MAY BE WITH A LITTLE ATTENTION WE MAY ALWAYS SUCCEED IN DISTINGUISHING IT FROM THE TRUE FACE
MADAME DE VILLEFORT WHO WAS IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS WOULD NEITHER BELIEVE NOR THINK OF THE MISFORTUNE BUT MADEMOISELLE VALENTINE AT THE FIRST WORDS GUESSED THE WHOLE TRUTH NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE PRECAUTIONS OF HER FATHER THE BLOW STRUCK HER LIKE A THUNDERBOLT
AH MONSIEUR YOU INFUSE GENUINE BALM INTO MY BLOOD WE HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES AND THIS VERY MORNING THE SURGEON DECLARED THAT IF MONSIEUR PORTHOS DID NOT PAY HIM HE SHOULD LOOK TO ME AS IT WAS I WHO HAD SENT FOR HIM PORTHOS IS WOUNDED THEN
AND I ON THAT OF THE HUGUENOT TWO HOURS AFTER ALL WAS OVER WE HAD DONE THE BUSINESS OF BOTH ADMIRING THE FORESIGHT OF OUR POOR FATHER WHO HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION TO BRING EACH OF US UP IN A DIFFERENT RELIGION WELL
D'ARTAGNAN WAS THEREFORE SERVED WITH MIRACULOUS CELERITY THE REGIMENT OF THE GUARDS WAS RECRUITED AMONG THE FIRST GENTLEMEN OF THE KINGDOM AND D'ARTAGNAN FOLLOWED BY A LACKEY AND TRAVELING WITH FOUR MAGNIFICENT HORSES
INSTEAD OF RETURNING DIRECTLY HOME
WHILE A SPIT LOADED WITH PARTRIDGES WAS TURNING BEFORE THE FIRE AND ON EACH SIDE OF A LARGE CHIMNEYPIECE OVER TWO CHAFING DISHES WERE BOILING TWO STEWPANS FROM WHICH EXHALED A DOUBLE ODOR OF RABBIT AND FISH STEWS
RETURN HOME AND GIVE THE FOUR GOLD PIECES YOU HAVE LEFT TO YOUR POOR OLD FATHER WHO IS WEEPING BECAUSE HE HAS NOT SEEN YOU FOR MANY A DAY TOMORROW MY FATHER WILL BE A RICH MAN FOR THESE FOUR GOLD PIECES WILL BECOME TWO THOUSAND
MONTE CRISTO REMAINED AS UNMOVED AS IF THE REPROACH HAD NOT BEEN ADDRESSED TO HIM ALBERT AT THIS MOMENT RAN IN OH MOTHER HE EXCLAIMED SUCH A MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED WHAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED ASKED THE COUNTESS
WHO HAS BEEN HERE COME SPEAK MONSIEUR DE CAVOIS
SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE LET THEM TELL THEIR STORY OUT REPLIED MOUSQUETON THEN AS IN LEAVING THE CABARET THEY TOOK DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
WHEN WAR CAME AND CARRIED ME AWAY I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME WELL ENOUGH TO WAIT FOR ME AND EVEN TO REMAIN FAITHFUL TO MY MEMORY WHEN I RETURNED SHE WAS MARRIED THIS IS THE HISTORY OF MOST MEN WHO HAVE PASSED TWENTY YEARS OF AGE
THE PROTESTANT RELIGION IMMEDIATELY PREVAILED IN HIS MIND HE LOWERED HIS GUN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAVELER THEN WHEN HE WAS WITHIN TEN PACES OF HIM HE COMMENCED A CONVERSATION WHICH ALMOST ALWAYS ENDED BY THE TRAVELER'S ABANDONING HIS PURSE TO SAVE HIS LIFE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING
BUT YOU ARE HERE MY DEAR FELLOW LET US SPEAK OF YOU I CONFESS I BEGAN TO BE VERY UNEASY ON YOUR ACCOUNT BUT YOUR HOST BEHAVES VERY WELL TOWARD YOU AS IT APPEARS MY DEAR PORTHOS
WHY I WAS HERE ONLY TEN OR TWELVE DAYS AGO I WAS CONDUCTING SOME FRIENDS MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM BY THE BY HAD A DISPUTE WITH A STRANGER
WHEN D'ARTAGNAN HAD FINISHED HE SAID HUM ALL THIS SAVORS OF HIS EMINENCE A LEAGUE OFF BUT WHAT IS TO BE DONE SAID D'ARTAGNAN NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT PRESENT BUT QUITTING PARIS AS I TOLD YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
BUT MOUSQUETON FORAGES AND BRINGS IN PROVISIONS FRIEND MOUSQUETON YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE A REINFORCEMENT AND WE MUST HAVE AN INCREASE OF SUPPLIES MOUSQUETON SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU MUST RENDER ME A SERVICE WHAT MONSIEUR
THIS TIME HE HAD DECIDED TO RELATE ALL THAT HAD PASSED
NO I NEVER SAW HIM UNTIL THAT MOMENT AND HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE VERY WELL I KNOW ALL THAT I WISH TO KNOW PORTHOS'S CHAMBER IS YOU SAY ON THE FIRST STORY NUMBER ONE
IT IS THAT AS I WAS CRUELLY BORED AS YOU SAY AND AS I HAD THE SEVENTY FIVE PISTOLES IN MY POCKET WHICH YOU HAD DISTRIBUTED TO ME IN ORDER TO AMUSE MYSELF I INVITED A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS TRAVELING THIS WAY TO WALK UP AND PROPOSED A CAST OF DICE
THE HOUR IS LATE I WANT TO GO ON THE NIGHT IS VERY DARK I WANT TO GO ON THE ROAD IS DANGEROUS I WANT TO GO ON
MY GOD THAT'S ALL I SHALL BE ABOUT AGAIN IN A FEW DAYS WHY DID YOU NOT HAVE YOURSELF CONVEYED TO PARIS YOU MUST BE CRUELLY BORED HERE THAT WAS MY INTENTION BUT MY DEAR FRIEND I HAVE ONE THING TO CONFESS TO YOU WHAT'S THAT
THAT BONACIEUX WAS TERRIFIED AT IT AND HE ENDEAVORED TO DRAW BACK A STEP OR TWO BUT AS HE WAS STANDING BEFORE THE HALF OF THE DOOR WHICH WAS SHUT THE OBSTACLE COMPELLED HIM TO KEEP HIS PLACE
I HAVE SUFFERED DEEPLY MADAME ANSWERED MONTE CRISTO BUT NOW YOU ARE HAPPY DOUBTLESS REPLIED THE COUNT SINCE NO ONE HEARS ME COMPLAIN AND YOUR PRESENT HAPPINESS HAS IT SOFTENED YOUR HEART
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NEVER COME IN WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW PLANCHET DEMANDED D'ARTAGNAN OH I GIVE YOU A HUNDRED I GIVE YOU A THOUSAND TIMES TO GUESS MONSIEUR THE VISIT I RECEIVED IN YOUR ABSENCE WHEN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO WHILE YOU WERE AT MONSIEUR DE TREVILLE'S
THE ANSWER WAS SO LITTLE LIKE THE ONE MERCEDES DESIRED THAT SHE TURNED AWAY TO GIVE VENT TO A SIGH WHICH SOUNDED MORE LIKE A GROAN THANK YOU SHE SAID AND THEY WALKED ON AGAIN
THIS LACKEY WAS MY COMPATRIOT AND WE BECAME THE MORE INTIMATE FROM THERE BEING MANY RESEMBLANCES OF CHARACTER BETWEEN US WE LOVED SPORTING OF ALL KINDS BETTER THAN ANYTHING SO THAT HE RELATED TO ME HOW IN THE PLAINS OF THE PAMPAS THE NATIVES HUNT THE TIGER AND THE WILD BULL
OUR HOST HAS A WELL FURNISHED CELLAR THE KEY OF WHICH NEVER LEAVES HIM ONLY THIS CELLAR HAS A VENTILATING HOLE NOW THROUGH THIS VENTILATING HOLE I THROW MY LASSO AND AS I NOW KNOW IN WHICH PART OF THE CELLAR IS THE BEST WINE THAT'S MY POINT FOR SPORT
THE COUNT LOOKED AT MERCEDES AS IF TO INTERROGATE HER BUT SHE CONTINUED TO WALK ON IN SILENCE AND HE REFRAINED FROM SPEAKING
HE ADOPTED A MIXED BELIEF WHICH PERMITTED HIM TO BE SOMETIMES CATHOLIC SOMETIMES A HUGUENOT
THE PLACE NAMED BY BONACIEUX AS THAT WHICH HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF HIS JOURNEY WAS A FRESH PROOF IN SUPPORT OF THE SUSPICIONS D'ARTAGNAN HAD CONCEIVED
HE FURNISHES IT IT IS TRUE BUT HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE HAS THAT HONOR EXPLAIN YOURSELF MOUSQUETON YOUR CONVERSATION IS FULL OF INSTRUCTIVE THINGS THAT IS IT MONSIEUR
THAT'S ALL DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS PRETENDED DUCHESS IS I REPEAT TO YOU I DON'T KNOW HER
THIS PROBABILITY AFFORDED HIM HIS FIRST CONSOLATION IF BONACIEUX KNEW WHERE HIS WIFE WAS ONE MIGHT BY EXTREME MEANS FORCE THE MERCER TO OPEN HIS TEETH AND LET HIS SECRET ESCAPE
SHE IS A SLAVE WHOM I BOUGHT AT CONSTANTINOPLE MADAME THE DAUGHTER OF A PRINCE I HAVE ADOPTED HER AS MY DAUGHTER HAVING NO ONE ELSE TO LOVE IN THE WORLD YOU LIVE ALONE THEN I DO YOU HAVE NO SISTER NO SON
INDEED YES THEY WENT TWO HOURS AGO WHY IN SUCH A HURRY UNFORTUNATELY THE CAT RECEIVED A TELEGRAM WHICH SAID THAT HIS FIRST BORN WAS SUFFERING FROM CHILBLAINS AND WAS ON THE POINT OF DEATH
SAID THE COUNTESS WITHOUT REPLYING TO THE QUESTION NO MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BUT YOU SEE I MAKE NO RESISTANCE WE ARE GOING TO THE GREENHOUSE THAT YOU SEE AT THE OTHER END OF THE GROVE
YOUR LORDSHIP DOES ME MUCH HONOR SAID THE HOST AND I THANK YOU SINCERELY FOR YOUR KIND WISH BUT DON'T MISTAKE SAID D'ARTAGNAN THERE IS MORE SELFISHNESS IN MY TOAST THAN PERHAPS YOU MAY THINK
MY PRESENT HAPPINESS EQUALS MY PAST MISERY SAID THE COUNT ARE YOU NOT MARRIED ASKED THE COUNTESS I MARRIED EXCLAIMED MONTE CRISTO SHUDDERING
THAT'S UNPARDONABLE IN A MAN OF YOUR AGE AND WHO BESIDES HAS SUCH A PRETTY WIFE AS YOURS OH LORD NO
THE STRANGER PLACED THE POINT OF HIS SWORD AT HIS THROAT AND MONSIEUR PORTHOS FINDING HIMSELF AT THE MERCY OF HIS ADVERSARY ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF CONQUERED
ALLOW ME TO TAKE A GLASS OF WATER IN YOUR APARTMENT YOU KNOW THAT IS NEVER REFUSED AMONG NEIGHBORS WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE PERMISSION OF HIS HOST D'ARTAGNAN WENT QUICKLY INTO THE HOUSE AND CAST A RAPID GLANCE AT THE BED IT HAD NOT BEEN USED
THE FALSEHOOD WOULD THEN LIE AT MY DOOR AND AS I AM NOT A GENTLEMAN I MAY BE ALLOWED TO LIE
WHERE DID MY GOOD FRIENDS SAY THEY WOULD WAIT FOR ME HE ADDED
PORTHOS SEEMED TO BREATHE MORE FREELY AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU MY DEAR PORTHOS CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN WHY ON MAKING A THRUST AT MY ADVERSARY WHOM I HAD ALREADY HIT THREE TIMES AND WHOM I MEANT TO FINISH WITH THE FOURTH
EXACTLY SO SAID THE HOST I REMEMBER IT PERFECTLY IT IS NOT MONSIEUR PORTHOS THAT YOUR LORDSHIP MEANS YES THAT IS MY COMPANION'S NAME MY GOD MY DEAR HOST TELL ME IF ANYTHING HAS HAPPENED TO HIM
THE GRAPES WERE NO OTHER THAN GOLD COINS WHICH TINKLED MERRILY AS THEY SWAYED IN THE WIND THEY SEEMED TO SAY
THEY REACHED THE BUILDING ORNAMENTED WITH MAGNIFICENT FRUITS WHICH RIPEN AT THE BEGINNING OF JULY IN THE ARTIFICIAL TEMPERATURE WHICH TAKES THE PLACE OF THE SUN SO FREQUENTLY ABSENT IN OUR CLIMATE THE COUNTESS LEFT THE ARM OF MONTE CRISTO
HOWEVER NOT ONE OF THEM WAS VERY HUNGRY THE POOR CAT FELT VERY WEAK AND HE WAS ABLE TO EAT ONLY THIRTY FIVE MULLETS WITH TOMATO SAUCE AND FOUR PORTIONS OF TRIPE WITH CHEESE MOREOVER
WELL CAN I SEE PORTHOS CERTAINLY MONSIEUR TAKE THE STAIRS ON YOUR RIGHT GO UP THE FIRST FLIGHT AND KNOCK AT NUMBER ONE ONLY WARN HIM THAT IT IS YOU WHY SHOULD I DO THAT
BECAUSE SHE FLEW INTO A GREAT PASSION ON RECEIVING THE LETTER
NO ONE CAN REPROACH YOU FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND MONSIEUR BONACIEUX SAID THE YOUNG MAN YOU ARE A MODEL FOR REGULAR PEOPLE IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN A MAN POSSESSES A YOUNG AND PRETTY WIFE HE HAS NO NEED TO SEEK HAPPINESS ELSEWHERE
THAT WHEN HE SAW A HUGUENOT COMING HE FELT HIMSELF FILLED WITH SUCH ARDENT CATHOLIC ZEAL
MONSIEUR HE CARRIED ON A TRADE WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT SATISFACTORY WHICH
NO ONE TOLD ME YOU WERE
ANSWERED THE LITTLE BEING IN A FAINT VOICE THAT SOUNDED AS IF IT CAME FROM A FAR AWAY WORLD WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE MARIONETTE I WANT TO GIVE YOU A FEW WORDS OF GOOD ADVICE
AND WHO BOTH KNEW HIM AGAIN SO THEY UNITED AGAINST HIM AND HANGED HIM ON A TREE
ROUND ABOUT HIM NOT A LEAF STIRRED A FEW BATS SKIMMED HIS NOSE NOW AND AGAIN AND SCARED HIM HALF TO DEATH
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE JOURNEY OF ONE OF MY LADS TO PARIS
WELL SHE MUST BE AT HER COUNTRY SEAT FOR SHE HAS NOT ANSWERED ME TRULY NO SO I YESTERDAY ADDRESSED ANOTHER EPISTLE TO HER STILL MORE PRESSING THAN THE FIRST
HE FOUND PLANCHET IN A GREAT FRIGHT AH MONSIEUR
THEY WENT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE GARDEN WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD SIR SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED THE COUNTESS AFTER THEIR WALK HAD CONTINUED TEN MINUTES IN SILENCE IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE SEEN SO MUCH TRAVELLED SO FAR AND SUFFERED SO DEEPLY
I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE COUNTRY AND MY FATHER IN HIS LEISURE TIME WAS SOMETHING OF A POACHER
PERHAPS MY HEART WAS WEAKER THAN THE HEARTS OF MOST MEN AND I SUFFERED MORE THAN THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IN MY PLACE THAT IS ALL THE COUNTESS STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AS IF GASPING FOR BREATH YES SHE SAID
ONE CAN ONLY LOVE ONCE AND DID YOU EVER SEE HER AGAIN NEVER NEVER I NEVER RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY WHERE SHE LIVED TO MALTA YES MALTA SHE IS THEN NOW AT MALTA I THINK SO
BUT WHAT SHALL WE DRINK TO SO AS TO AVOID WOUNDING ANY SUSCEPTIBILITY LET US DRINK TO THE PROSPERITY OF YOUR ESTABLISHMENT
PARDON MY DEAR MONSIEUR BONACIEUX IF I DON'T STAND UPON CEREMONY SAID D'ARTAGNAN BUT NOTHING MAKES ONE SO THIRSTY AS WANT OF SLEEP I AM PARCHED WITH THIRST
AS THOUGH AWAKENING FROM A SLEEP TO THE REALITIES OF LIFE DID YOU SAY A MISFORTUNE INDEED I SHOULD EXPECT MISFORTUNES
DO NOT MY MOTHER AND YOU AGREE ASKED ALBERT ASTONISHED ON THE CONTRARY REPLIED THE COUNT DID YOU NOT HEAR HER DECLARE THAT WE WERE FRIENDS THEY RE ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM
SHE EXCLAIMED IN SO PLAINTIVE AN ACCENT THAT IT SEEMED TO STIFLE A SOB REALLY YOU PAIN ME A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED THE PEACH LIKE THE GRAPES FELL TO THE GROUND COUNT ADDED MERCEDES WITH A SUPPLICATING GLANCE
D'ARTAGNAN REMARKED SOMETHING PERFIDIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE PLAY OF THE WRINKLED FEATURES OF HIS COUNTENANCE A ROGUE DOES NOT LAUGH IN THE SAME WAY THAT AN HONEST MAN DOES A HYPOCRITE DOES NOT SHED THE TEARS OF A MAN OF GOOD FAITH
WELL HE COMES TO FETCH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER WHY SO
AND JUST AS SOON AS YOU HAVE HANDED OVER TO ME THOSE LITTLE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS SHE WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU IF YOU HAVE ME ARRESTED MY COMRADE WILL GIVE A TURN OF HIS THUMB TO THE LARK THAT'S ALL
STRIKING I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU SEE TO ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
THAN A REMEMBRANCE OF UDO'S APPEARANCE STARTED HIM OFF AGAIN I COULDN'T HAVE STAYED WITH HIM A MOMENT LONGER HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BURST
BUT NO DOUBT HE WOULD THINK OF SOME TREMENDOUSLY CUNNING DEVICE LATER ON TO EURALIA THEN WITH ALL DISPATCH HE TROTTED OFF
HE MIGHT GO BACK TO ARABY
WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK THAT AFTERNOON AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN CORONEL POINTED OUT THAT AS SHE HAD TURNED PRINCE UDO INTO INTO A A QUITE SO SAID UDO
THEREFORE I HAD NO INCLINATION TO PROLONG THE TIME ADD TO THIS MY SITUATION WAS IN OTHER RESPECTS VERY UNPLEASANT I MET MANY LARGE FISH WHO WERE IF I COULD JUDGE BY THEIR OPEN MOUTHS
IN THIS BOX HE HIDES A WATCH SPRING AND THIS WATCH SPRING PROPERLY HANDLED CUTS GOOD SIZED CHAINS AND BARS OF IRON THE UNFORTUNATE CONVICT IS SUPPOSED TO POSSESS MERELY A SOU NOT AT ALL
IT WAS BY THE PERIL OF THE ONE HE LOVED THAT HE FELT HIMSELF RESTRAINED THIS FRIGHTFUL SITUATION WHICH HAD ALREADY LASTED ABOVE HALF AN HOUR WAS CHANGING ITS ASPECT EVERY MOMENT
MARIUS HAD SUFFICIENT STRENGTH OF MIND TO REVIEW IN SUCCESSION ALL THE MOST HEART BREAKING CONJECTURES SEEKING HOPE AND FINDING NONE
FALSE ADDRESS THE RUFFIAN WHO HAD GONE WITH HER MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEHIND HER AND PICKED UP HIS AXE AGAIN SHE RESUMED NOBODY THERE
SOFTLY DETACHED A BIT OF PLASTER FROM THE WALL WRAPPED THE PAPER ROUND IT AND TOSSED THE WHOLE THROUGH THE CREVICE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DEN IT WAS HIGH TIME THENARDIER HAD CONQUERED HIS LAST FEARS OR HIS LAST SCRUPLES
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT HE WAS SAVE THAT THERE WAS AN IMPRESSION OF MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIS PERSON SUCH MAGNIFICENCE ANYHOW AS IS GIVEN BY AN ASTRAKHAN TRIMMED FUR COAT
WHY NOT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD CALLED FOR HIM WHAT DEVOTION IT SHOWED IF HE CAME TO HER EVEN NOW IN HIS PRESENT STATE OF BAD HEALTH SHE WAS IN TROUBLE
AS SHE SANK SHE FELL UPON HER SIDE AND FORCED A VERY LARGE LOBSTER TREE OUT OF ITS PLACE IT WAS IN THE SPRING WHEN THE LOBSTERS WERE VERY YOUNG
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO CUT HIS THROAT THAT'S IT IT WAS THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TAKING COUNSEL TOGETHER THENARDIER WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE TABLE
THE UNHAPPY WRETCH WHO ASPIRES TO DELIVERANCE FINDS MEANS SOMETIMES WITHOUT TOOLS SOMETIMES WITH A COMMON WOODEN HANDLED KNIFE TO SAW A SOU INTO TWO THIN PLATES
I'M TELLING YOU HOW THINGS STAND I WARN YOU SO THAT YOU MAY BE PREPARED HE PAUSED THE PRISONER DID NOT BREAK THE SILENCE AND THENARDIER RESUMED
I WILL NOW FAITHFULLY GIVE YOU IN HIS OWN WORDS AS I HEARD HIM RELATE THEM TO HIS FRIENDS SEVERAL TIMES ON MY ARRIVAL SAYS MY FATHER AT HELVOETSLUYS I WAS OBSERVED TO BREATHE WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
HE SAT UP SUDDENLY AND STARED AT CORONEL IT WAS THAT OLD WOMAN DID IT YOU MARK MY WORDS CORONEL SHE DID IT WHY SHOULD SHE
AS SOON AS MY WIFE RETURNS AND SAYS TO ME THE LARK IS ON THE WAY WE WILL RELEASE YOU AND YOU WILL BE FREE TO GO AND SLEEP AT HOME YOU SEE THAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE NOT EVIL
I ENDEAVOURED TO BRING ONE WITH ME BUT IT WAS TOO CUMBERSOME AND MY SALT WATER PEGASUS SEEMED MUCH DISPLEASED AT EVERY ATTEMPT TO STOP HIS CAREER WHILST I CONTINUED UPON HIS BACK
HE POSSESSES LIBERTY IT WAS A LARGE SOU OF THIS SORT
HE WAS NOT THINKING OF UDO HE WAS WONDERING IF PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD AN ATTENDANT OF SURPASSING BEAUTY OR A DRAGON OF SURPASSING MALEVOLENCE IF IN FACT
ARE SAID TO BE UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED FATHOMS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA ON THE SIDES OF WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT VARIETY OF TALL NOBLE TREES LOADED WITH MARINE FRUIT SUCH AS LOBSTERS CRABS OYSTERS SCOLLOPS
WHEN THE POLICE MADE THEIR DESCENT ON IT THIS SOU PIECE WAS ONE OF THOSE MARVELS OF INDUSTRY WHICH ARE ENGENDERED BY THE PATIENCE OF THE GALLEYS IN THE SHADOWS AND FOR THE SHADOWS MARVELS WHICH ARE NOTHING ELSE THAN INSTRUMENTS OF ESCAPE
HE SAID ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE STARTING WE AREN'T STARTING SAID THE VOICE WHAT'S THE MATTER WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE BUSHES FOR WHATEVER'S THE MATTER UDO
I WAS AFRAID SO HE SAID THAT'S THE CRUEL PART ABOUT IT HAD I BEEN A LION THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CERTAIN PATHETIC SPLENDOUR ABOUT MY POSITION ISOLATED CUT OFF SUFFERING IN REGAL SILENCE
THEY WILL BOTH ENTER THE CARRIAGE WITH MY COMRADE BEHIND SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THE BARRIER THERE IS A TRAP HARNESSED TO TWO VERY GOOD HORSES YOUR YOUNG LADY WILL BE TAKEN TO IT SHE WILL ALIGHT FROM THE FIACRE
MARIUS CAST A WILD GLANCE ABOUT HIM THE LAST MECHANICAL RESOURCE OF DESPAIR ALL AT ONCE A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH HIM AT HIS FEET ON THE TABLE A BRIGHT RAY OF LIGHT FROM THE FULL MOON
BUT FOR THE MOMENT I CANNOT SEE BEYOND THE SADNESS OF IT THAT TO A PRINCE OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF ARABY
THE HORRIBLE GLOWING TOOL DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT WHIRLING AS IT FLEW AND FELL FAR AWAY ON THE SNOW THE PRISONER RESUMED DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH ME HE WAS DISARMED
THE ENIGMA WAS MORE IMPENETRABLE THAN EVER WHO WAS THIS LITTLE ONE WHOM THENARDIER HAD CALLED THE LARK WAS SHE HIS URSULE THE PRISONER HAD NOT SEEMED TO BE AFFECTED BY THAT WORD THE LARK
TO HOLLOW OUT THESE PLATES WITHOUT AFFECTING THE COINAGE STAMP AND TO MAKE A FURROW ON THE EDGE OF THE SOU IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE PLATES WILL ADHERE AGAIN THIS CAN BE SCREWED TOGETHER AND UNSCREWED AT WILL IT IS A BOX
FOLLOWED HIM IN AN OPEN BOAT AS SOON AS SHE HAD GOT ON THE QUARTER DECK SHE FLEW AT HER HUSBAND AND ATTEMPTED TO STRIKE HIM WITH SUCH IMPETUOSITY THAT HE THOUGHT IT MOST PRUDENT TO SLIP ON ONE SIDE
IT'S NOTHING BUT A BIG CARRIAGE GATE
HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY
HE FOUND THIS GENTLE CREATURE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL AND LEARNED THE MEANS BY WHICH SHE CAME INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
THE CONTRAST WAS TOO STRIKING BUT HE ALONE HYACINTH'S ONLY HELP SURELY SHE WOULD APPRECIATE HIS MAGNANIMITY ALSO AS HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF A MOMENT AGO
I THINK I'M COMING OUT WONDERING WHAT IT ALL MEANT CORONEL WAITED IN SILENCE YES I AM COMING OUT CORONEL SAID THE VOICE BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE SURPRISED IF I DON'T LOOK VERY WELL
UNTAMABLE IN THE MAN THEY LOVE WELL THERE IT WAS IT WAS NOT AS IF HE HAD CORONEL WITH HIM CORONEL AND HE IN HIS PRESENT HEALTH COULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO EURALIA TOGETHER
REALLY FRANKLY HE ASKED
BESIDES I WAS THEN THOUGH GALLOPING OVER A MOUNTAIN OF ROCKS THAT LAY ABOUT MIDWAY THE PASSAGE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED FATHOM BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND BEGAN TO FIND THE WANT OF AIR INCONVENIENT
SEIZE HIM SAID THENARDIER TWO OF THE RUFFIANS LAID THEIR HANDS ON HIS SHOULDER AND THE MASKED MAN WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE TOOK UP HIS STATION IN FRONT OF HIM
THE PERIWINKLE IS A KIND OF SHRUB IT GROWS AT THE FOOT OF THE OYSTER TREE AND TWINES ROUND IT AS THE IVY DOES THE OAK
HE WAVED AN EXPLANATORY PAW EVEN IN THE MOST HIDEOUS OF BEASTS THERE MIGHT BE A DIGNITY HE MEDITATED FOR A MOMENT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A YAK CORONEL HE ASKED NEVER
WHAT THAT YOUNG GIRL WHOM THEY WERE ABDUCTING WAS NOT TO BE BROUGHT BACK ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS WAS TO BEAR HER OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHITHER AND WHAT IF IT WERE SHE IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS SHE
THINK THAT THE LARK REALLY IS YOUR DAUGHTER
REALLY I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BECAUSE I'M TOO UNIMPORTANT YES THAT MUST BE IT HE BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE BRIGHTER OBVIOUSLY THAT'S IT HE CARESSED A WHISKER WITH ONE OF HIS PAWS
SAID UDO NERVOUSLY THEN FRANKLY YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS LOOKS FUNNY VERY FUNNY SAID UDO WISTFULLY VERY FUNNY SAID CORONEL HIS HIGHNESS SIGHED
WELL THINK OF THAT UDO SHOWED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF IT BY WAVING IT PEEVISHLY THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR TACT HE SAID TELL ME WHAT I LOOK LIKE CORONEL CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT
THIS HE REJECTED AT ONCE WHEN YOU HAVE THE HEAD OF A RABBIT THE TAIL OF A LION AND THE MIDDLE OF A WOOLLY LAMB THE NEED FOR ACTION OF SOME KIND IS IMPERATIVE
AND MANY OF THEM BEING SEPARATED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE SHOCK THEY FELL UPON A CRAB TREE WHICH WAS GROWING BELOW THEM THEY HAVE LIKE THE FARINA OF PLANTS UNITED AND PRODUCED A FISH RESEMBLING BOTH
THE PRISONER DID NOT STIR STILL MARIUS FANCIED THAT AT INTERVALS AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HE HAD HEARD A FAINT DULL NOISE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISONER ALL AT ONCE THENARDIER ADDRESSED THE PRISONER
HE ADDED BITTERLY HOW DID IT HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW CORONEL I JUST WENT TO SLEEP
RABBIT HE SOBBED SO UNDIGNIFIED
HOWEVER WE'LL SOON GET HIM ALL RIGHT THAT EVENING HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE COTTAGE HAD STOOD BUT IT WAS GONE NEXT MORNING HE RODE BACK TO THE WOOD UDO WAS GONE TOO
THE REVOLTS OF THE FLESH AND THE SENSES WHEN SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL SUFFERING CAUSE THE SOUL TO SPRING FORTH AND MAKE IT APPEAR ON THE BROW JUST AS REBELLIONS AMONG THE SOLDIERY FORCE THE CAPTAIN TO SHOW HIMSELF
THENARDIER RAPIDLY UNFOLDED THE PAPER AND HELD IT CLOSE TO THE CANDLE IT'S IN EPONINE'S HANDWRITING THE DEVIL HE MADE A SIGN TO HIS WIFE WHO HASTILY DREW NEAR
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO GAIN BY THAT TO GAIN TIME CRIED THE PRISONER IN A THUNDERING VOICE AND AT THE SAME INSTANT HE SHOOK OFF HIS BONDS THEY WERE CUT
STARED AT HIM IN STUPEFACTION AS ALMOST FREE AND IN A FORMIDABLE ATTITUDE HE BRANDISHED ABOVE HIS HEAD THE RED HOT CHISEL WHICH EMITTED A THREATENING GLOW
AND IT WAS MY UNFORTUNATE LOT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR BRINGING THIS HAPPY PAIR TOGETHER AGAIN I CAN EASILY CONCEIVE WHAT EXECRATIONS THE HUSBAND LOADED ME WITH WHEN ON HIS RETURN
AND MAKE HER TELL ME WHAT SHE KNOWS SHE KNOWS SOMETHING I'M CERTAIN THEN WE SHALL SEE BETTER WHAT TO DO UDO MUSED FOR A SPACE WHY DIDN'T THEY TURN YOU INTO ANYTHING HE ASKED
THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME WRITE WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO WRITE THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME SAY WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO SAY HE STRIPPED UP HIS LEFT SLEEVE AND ADDED SEE HERE
HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE THENARDIER WOMAN DID IN FACT RUSH HASTILY INTO THE ROOM RED PANTING BREATHLESS WITH FLAMING EYES AND CRIED AS SHE SMOTE HER HUGE HANDS ON HER THIGHS SIMULTANEOUSLY
SO POPULAR TO ARABY WHERE HE RODE DAILY AMONG HIS FATHER'S SUBJECTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CHEERING HIM HOW AWKWARD FOR EVERYBODY ON TO EURALIA THEN
THENARDIER EXCLAIMED ARE YOU MAD ARE YOU CRAZY WHAT A PACK OF BOOBIES YOU WANT TO WASTE TIME DO YOU DRAW LOTS DO YOU BY A WET FINGER BY A SHORT STRAW
AND LET HER MAKE THE IMPRESSION OF HER FINGERS UPON THE WAVES RATHER THAN HIS FACE HE WAS NOT MUCH OUT IN HIS IDEAS OF THE CONSEQUENCE FOR MEETING NO OPPOSITION SHE WENT DIRECTLY OVERBOARD
CARRYING THEIR HEADS AT THE EXTREMITY OF THEIR TAILS I CROSSED CONTINUED HE ONE PRODIGIOUS RANGE OF ROCKS EQUAL IN HEIGHT TO THE ALPS THE TOPS OR HIGHEST PARTS OF THESE MARINE MOUNTAINS
IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE THE DOOR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE WAS HEARD TO OPEN AND SHUT AGAIN THE PRISONER MADE A MOVEMENT IN HIS BONDS HERE'S THE BOURGEOISE SAID THENARDIER
SO THEY HELD A COUNCIL OF WAR PRINCE UDO PUT FORWARD TWO SUGGESTIONS THE FIRST WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK ON THE MORROW AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN THE SECOND
THIS WAS WHAT MARIUS PERCEIVED MOST CLEARLY OF ALL A SORT OF HORRIBLE FASCINATION HELD HIM NAILED TO HIS POST FROM WHICH HE WAS OBSERVING AND COMMANDING THIS WHOLE SCENE THERE HE STOOD
CORONEL STOPPED YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S COMMANDS HE BEGAN RATHER COLDLY THERE WAS AN OMINOUS SNIFFING FROM THE BUSHES CORONEL SAID AN UNHAPPY VOICE AT LAST
WITH WRITTEN NAMES THROWN INTO A HAT WOULD YOU LIKE MY HAT CRIED A VOICE ON THE THRESHOLD
NOT ONLY ABLE BUT REALLY WISHED TO DEVOUR US NOW AS MY ROSINANTE WAS BLIND I HAD THESE HUNGRY GENTLEMEN'S ATTEMPTS TO GUARD AGAINST IN ADDITION TO MY OTHER DIFFICULTIES
READY TO SMASH HIS SKULL AT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT AT THE SAME TIME MARIUS HEARD BELOW HIM AT THE BASE OF THE PARTITION BUT SO NEAR THAT HE COULD NOT SEE WHO WAS SPEAKING THIS COLLOQUY CONDUCTED IN A LOW TONE
REPLIED THENARDIER SINCE PONINE HAS THROWN THE STONE THROUGH THE WINDOW IT INDICATES THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT WATCHED ON THAT SIDE THE MASK WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE DEPOSITED HIS HUGE KEY ON THE FLOOR
ROGER SCURVILEGS FRANKLY BREAKS DOWN OVER IT THAT ABOMINABLE WOMAN HE SAYS MEANING OF COURSE BELVANE AND HE HAS HYSTERICS FOR MORE THAN A PAGE LET US DESCRIBE IT CALMLY
AND WHERE HE KEEPS HIS SHINERS THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE MANAGED MATTERS PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE A DEAL STUPIDER THAN WOMEN
WAS SAFE WHILE HIS EXASPERATED WIFE VOCIFERATED
SHE WOULD FIND HIM STROKABLE AND THE LION IN HIM
THE PRISONER UTTERED NOT A SYLLABLE AFTER A PAUSE THENARDIER CONTINUED IT'S VERY SIMPLE AS YOU SEE THERE'LL BE NO HARM DONE UNLESS YOU WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE HARM DONE
I WAS VERY POLITE TO HER DON'T YOU REMEMBER MY SAYING TO YOU BE POLITE TO HER BECAUSE SHE'S PROBABLY A FAIRY
THIS WAS THE EXPEDIENT OF WHICH HE WAS IN SEARCH THE SOLUTION OF THAT FRIGHTFUL PROBLEM WHICH WAS TORTURING HIM OF SPARING THE ASSASSIN AND SAVING THE VICTIM HE KNELT DOWN ON HIS COMMODE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARM SEIZED THE SHEET OF PAPER
AND WHERE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH ONE MAY COME TO LOVE
THIS IS A PAINFUL CHAPTER FOR ME TO WRITE MERCIFULLY IT IS TO BE A SHORT ONE LATER ON I SHALL BECOME USED TO THE SITUATION INCLINED EVEN TO DWELL UPON ITS HUMOROUS SIDE
I'M I'M CORONEL HERE I AM SAID UDO PATHETICALLY
CORONEL GOT ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF EARSHOT HE BEGAN TO LAUGH SPASM AFTER SPASM SHOOK HIM NO SOONER HAD HE COMPOSED HIMSELF TO GRAVITY
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT SWUNG HIS RIGHT FOOT WHICH HUNG DOWN AND STARED AT THE BRAZIER WITH AN AIR OF SAVAGE REVERY
MY COMRADE WILL ENTER THE OTHER VEHICLE WITH HER AND MY WIFE WILL COME BACK HERE TO TELL US IT'S DONE AS FOR THE YOUNG LADY NO HARM WILL BE DONE TO HER
AS WE DREW NEAR THE DUTCH SHORE AND THE BODY OF WATER OVER OUR HEADS DID NOT EXCEED TWENTY FATHOMS I THOUGHT I SAW A HUMAN FIGURE IN A FEMALE DRESS THEN LYING ON THE SAND BEFORE ME WITH SOME SIGNS OF LIFE
THERE WERE ANY ADVENTURES IN EURALIA FOR A HUMBLE FELLOW LIKE HIMSELF CORONEL SAID A SMALL VOICE BEHIND HIM HE TURNED ROUND INDIFFERENTLY
THE PRISONER WAS ONLY ATTACHED TO THE BED NOW BY ONE LEG BEFORE THE SEVEN MEN HAD TIME TO COLLECT THEIR SENSES AND DASH FORWARD HE HAD BENT DOWN INTO THE FIREPLACE HAD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO THE BRAZIER
THE ONE ENJOINING HIM TO RESPECT HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT THE OTHER CRYING TO HIM TO RESCUE THE PRISONER THESE TWO VOICES CONTINUED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT STRUGGLE WHICH TORMENTED HIM TO AGONY UP TO THAT MOMENT
IT WAS LIKELY THAT SHE ALONE COULD TURN HIM BACK AGAIN AND THAT IN THAT CASE HE HAD BETTER ONLY THREATEN HER I WANT SOMEBODY KILLED SAID UDO RATHER NATURALLY SUPPOSE SAID CORONEL
HE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND BEGAN TO THINK IT OUT LEFT TO HIMSELF UDO VERY SOON MADE UP HIS MIND THERE WERE THREE COURSES OPEN TO HIM HE MIGHT STAY WHERE HE WAS TILL HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME HE BEGAN TO LOOK SO MUCH HAPPIER THAT CORONEL THOUGHT IT WAS A FAVOURABLE MOMENT IN WHICH TO WITHDRAW SHALL I GO NOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
SHE HANDED IT TO HER HUSBAND WHERE DID THIS COME FROM DEMANDED THENARDIER PARDIE EJACULATED HIS WIFE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE IT CAME FROM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
ARE TO JEWELLERS WORK WHAT THE METAPHORS OF SLANG ARE TO POETRY THERE ARE BENVENUTO CELLINIS IN THE GALLEYS
AS HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEND DOWN FOR FEAR OF BETRAYING HIMSELF HE HAD NOT CUT THE BONDS OF HIS LEFT LEG THE RUFFIANS HAD RECOVERED FROM THEIR FIRST SURPRISE BE EASY
AND HAD THEN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AGAIN AND NOW THENARDIER THE FEMALE THENARDIER AND THE RUFFIANS HUDDLED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE HOVEL
I OMITTED SEVERAL VERY MATERIAL PARTS IN MY FATHER'S JOURNEY ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL TO HOLLAND WHICH THAT THEY MAY NOT BE TOTALLY LOST
SHE WOULD FIND THAT INSPIRING
AND AFTER ALL THAT RACING AND FEE TO THE COACHMAN AND ALL I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PORTER AND THE PORTRESS A FINE STOUT WOMAN AND THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM MARIUS BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE
CORONEL CAME BACK FROM HIS STROLL IN THE SAME CASUAL WAY IN WHICH HE HAD STARTED
WHEN I CAME CLOSE I PERCEIVED HER HAND MOVE I TOOK IT INTO MINE AND BROUGHT HER ON SHORE AS A CORPSE AN APOTHECARY WHO HAD JUST BEEN INSTRUCTED BY DOCTOR HAWES
I SAW ONE ONCE IN BARODIA IT IS NOT A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL CORONEL BUT AS A YAK I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNLOVABLE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH AT A YAK CORONEL
A WOMAN'S LIFE SAVED THE CAUSE OF HER FALLING INTO THE SEA
OPENED THE DRAWER AND TOOK OUT THE KNIFE MARIUS FRETTED WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS PISTOL UNPRECEDENTED PERPLEXITY FOR THE LAST HOUR HE HAD HAD TWO VOICES IN HIS CONSCIENCE
OF LONDON TREATED HER PROPERLY AND SHE RECOVERED SHE WAS THE RIB OF A MAN WHO COMMANDED A VESSEL BELONGING TO HELVOETSLUYS HE WAS JUST GOING OUT OF PORT ON A VOYAGE WHEN SHE HEARING HE HAD GOT A MISTRESS WITH HIM
AND THEN I WILL GIVE MY LIFE AND MY BLOOD IF NECESSARY BUT I WILL DELIVER HER NOTHING SHALL STOP ME NEARLY HALF AN HOUR PASSED IN THIS MANNER THENARDIER SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN GLOOMY REFLECTIONS
GOOD BYE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
SHE PAUSED CHOKING THEN WENT ON
FRUIT SHOOK OFF THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE IT GROWS UPON BY THE MOTION OF THE WATER AS THOSE IN OUR GARDENS ARE BY THAT OF THE WIND THE LOBSTER TREES APPEARED THE RICHEST BUT THE CRAB AND OYSTERS WERE THE TALLEST
ALREADY THEN HE HAD SUFFERED IN HER SERVICE SO AT LEAST HE WOULD SAY AND SO POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE CORONEL HAD THOUGHT HIM FUNNY BUT WOMEN HAD NOT MUCH SENSE OF HUMOUR AS A RULE
CORONEL DECIDED THAT IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR TACT AH HERE YOU ARE HE SAID CHEERFULLY SHALL WE GET ALONG DON'T BE A FOOL CORONEL SAID UDO ALMOST CRYING
ALMOST INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT OR REFLECTION AS THOUGH ANNIHILATED BY THE ABOMINABLE THINGS VIEWED AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS HE WAITED IN THE HOPE OF SOME INCIDENT NO MATTER OF WHAT NATURE
AT THE SAME MOMENT HE EXTENDED HIS ARM AND LAID THE GLOWING CHISEL WHICH HE HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND BY ITS WOODEN HANDLE
WHAT WAS HE TO DO DISCHARGE THE PISTOL PLACE ALL THOSE SCOUNDRELS IN THE HANDS OF JUSTICE BUT THE HORRIBLE MAN WITH THE MEAT AXE WOULD NONE THE LESS BE OUT OF REACH WITH THE YOUNG GIRL
YOU ARE TOO GOOD YOU SEE IF IT HAD BEEN ME I'D HAVE CHOPPED THE BEAST IN FOUR QUARTERS TO BEGIN WITH AND IF HE HAD ACTED UGLY I'D HAVE BOILED HIM ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK AND SAY WHERE THE GIRL IS
FINALLY HE SAID TO THE PRISONER WITH A SLOW AND SINGULARLY FEROCIOUS TONE
THEY ALSO FOUND A TINY SAW OF BLUE STEEL WHICH WOULD FIT THE SOU IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRISONER HAD THIS SOU PIECE ON HIS PERSON AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE RUFFIANS SEARCHED HIM THAT HE CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IT IN HIS HAND
ASKED THE THENARDIER WOMAN WE HAVEN'T THE TIME THROUGH WHAT
AND A MITE OF A GIRL FACING THE END OF EVERYTHING YOUR HIGHNESS IS SAID TO BE BRAVE BUT EVEN YOUR WONDERFUL COURAGE CAN AVAIL NOTHING IN THIS INSTANCE SAID THE LEADER PLEASANTLY
WE HAVE ONLY THE BEST OF MOTIVES IN MIND TRUE THE HILLS ARE FULL OF LAWLESS FELLOWS AND WE ARE OBLIGED TO FIGHT THEM ALMOST DAILY BUT YOU HAVE FALLEN IN WITH HONEST MEN VERY NICE GENTLEMEN I TRUST LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO WE PUT A BAND OF ROBBERS TO FLIGHT
I TOOK UP THE FIRST VOLUME ONCE AND LOOKED IT OVER BUT I SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO INDEED I GUESSED WHAT SORT OF STUFF IT MUST BE BEFORE I SAW IT
IT WOULD BE USELESS TO DENY THE STORY THESE MEN WOULD NOT BELIEVE HER IN A FLASH
CALLING OUT TO HIS COMPANIONS IN A LANGUAGE STRANGE TO BEVERLY HE CRACKED THE WHIP AND ONCE MORE THEY WERE LUMBERING OVER THE WRETCHED ROAD BEVERLY SANK BACK INTO THE SEAT WITH A DEEP SIGH OF RESIGNATION WELL I'M IN FOR IT SHE THOUGHT
CONFESSED BEVERLY THE CHIEF OF THE HONEST MEN LAUGHED AGAIN A CLEAR RINGING LAUGH THAT BESPOKE SUPREME CONFIDENCE IN HIS RIGHT TO ENJOY HIMSELF AND WHO IS AUNT FANNY HE ASKED
PERMIT ME TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER ALONE YOU HAVE A RAGGED FOLLOWING YOUR HIGHNESS BUT IT SHALL BE A LOYAL ONE WILL YOU RE ENTER THE COACH IT IS NOT FAR TO THE PLACE I SPEAK OF AND I MYSELF WILL DRIVE YOU THERE COME
NOT I FAITH NO IF I READ ANY IT SHALL BE MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S HER NOVELS ARE AMUSING ENOUGH THEY ARE WORTH READING SOME FUN AND NATURE IN THEM UDOLPHO WAS WRITTEN BY MISSUS RADCLIFFE SAID CATHERINE
AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS
AND RACED BACK OVER THE ROAD THEY HAD TRAVELED SO PRECIPITOUSLY OVERCOME BY SURPRISE AND DISMAY
AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HE DID MISS MORLAND I AM SURE I CANNOT GUESS AT ALL CURRICLE HUNG YOU SEE SEAT TRUNK SWORD CASE SPLASHING BOARD LAMPS SILVER MOULDING ALL YOU SEE COMPLETE THE IRON WORK AS GOOD AS NEW OR BETTER
I AM POWERLESS I ONLY IMPLORE YOU TO TAKE WHAT VALUABLES YOU MAY FIND AND LET US PROCEED UNHARMED SHE CRIED RAPIDLY EAGER TO HAVE IT OVER PRAY HOW CAN YOUR HIGHNESS PROCEED YOU HAVE NO GUIDE NO DRIVER NO ESCORT
BUT PRAY WHY DO YOU CALL ME YOUR HIGHNESS DEMANDED BEVERLY THE TALL LEADER SWEPT THE GROUND WITH HIS HAT ONCE MORE ALL THE OUTSIDE WORLD KNOWS THE PRINCESS YETIVE WHY NOT THE HUMBLE MOUNTAIN MAN YOU WILL PARDON ME
AND THE MOANING OF THE OLD NEGRESS BEVERLY REALIZED WITH A SINKING HEART THAT THEY WERE ALONE AND HELPLESS IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH NIGHT UPON THEM SHE NEVER KNEW WHERE THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE CAME FROM
THEN AT LAST TO SATISFY HIMSELF WALKED OVER AND PEERED INTO THE COACH AUNT FANNY SET UP A DISMAL HOWL AN INSTANT LATER SIR HONESTY WAS PUSHED ASIDE AND MISS CALHOUN WAS ANXIOUSLY TRYING TO COMFORT HER OLD FRIEND THROUGH THE WINDOW
BY THIS TIME THEY HAD STRUCK A DESCENT IN THE ROAD AND WERE RUSHING ALONG AT BREAKNECK SPEED INTO OPPRESSIVE SHADOWS THAT BORE THE FIRST IMPRINTS OF NIGHT REALIZING AT LAST THAT HER CRIES WERE FALLING UPON PURPOSELY DEAF EARS
HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT AT LEAST ONE OF HER MEN HAD REMAINED FAITHFUL A MAN STEPPED QUIETLY FROM THE INNER SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ADVANCED WITH THE UNCERTAIN TREAD OF ONE WHO IS OVERCOME BY AMAZEMENT HE WAS A STRANGER
THOUGH THEY OVERTOOK AND PASSED THE TWO OFFENDING YOUNG MEN IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS SO FAR FROM SEEKING TO ATTRACT THEIR NOTICE THAT SHE LOOKED BACK AT THEM ONLY THREE TIMES JOHN THORPE KEPT OF COURSE WITH CATHERINE
WHICH HE COULD HAVE LEISURE TO DO WHILE THE BRIGHT EYES OF MISS THORPE WERE INCESSANTLY CHALLENGING HIS NOTICE AND TO HER HIS DEVOIRS WERE SPEEDILY PAID WITH A MIXTURE OF JOY AND EMBARRASSMENT WHICH MIGHT HAVE INFORMED CATHERINE
EXPECTING THE MURDEROUS BLADE OF THE DRIVER TO MEET HER AS SHE DID SO PAULOFF HAD SWUNG FROM THE BOX OF THE COACH AND WAS PEERING FIRST INTO THE WOODLAND BELOW
BUT I CHANCED TO MEET HIM ON MAGDALEN BRIDGE AS HE WAS DRIVING INTO OXFORD LAST TERM AH THORPE SAID HE DO YOU HAPPEN TO WANT SUCH A LITTLE THING AS THIS IT IS A CAPITAL ONE OF THE KIND BUT I AM CURSED TIRED OF IT
FOR WHILE HE SLIGHTLY AND CARELESSLY TOUCHED THE HAND OF ISABELLA ON HER HE BESTOWED A WHOLE SCRAPE AND HALF A SHORT BOW HE WAS A STOUT YOUNG MAN OF MIDDLING HEIGHT WHO WITH A PLAIN FACE AND UNGRACEFUL FORM
THE SERVANT HAD JUST MOUNTED THE CARRIAGE AND WAS DRIVING OFF SUCH TRUE BLOOD
WITH ITS GALLANT SMILE AND OMINOUS PATCH SHE HESITATED FEAR ENTERING HER SOUL ONCE MORE
BUT CATHERINE HEARD NEITHER THE PARTICULARS NOR THE RESULT HER COMPANION'S DISCOURSE NOW SUNK FROM ITS HITHERTO ANIMATED PITCH TO NOTHING MORE THAN A SHORT DECISIVE SENTENCE OF PRAISE OR CONDEMNATION ON THE FACE OF EVERY WOMAN THEY MET AND CATHERINE
LOOK AT THAT CREATURE AND SUPPOSE IT POSSIBLE IF YOU CAN HE DOES LOOK VERY HOT TO BE SURE HOT HE HAD NOT TURNED A HAIR TILL WE CAME TO WALCOT CHURCH
AND THIS ADDRESS
JAMES ACCEPTED THIS TRIBUTE OF GRATITUDE AND QUALIFIED HIS CONSCIENCE FOR ACCEPTING IT TOO BY SAYING WITH PERFECT SINCERITY INDEED CATHERINE I LOVE YOU DEARLY
NO NO I SHALL EXERCISE MINE AT THE AVERAGE OF FOUR HOURS EVERY DAY WHILE I AM HERE SHALL YOU INDEED SAID CATHERINE VERY SERIOUSLY
AND THE PRAISE OF SUCH A GIRL AS MISS THORPE EVEN YOU CATHERINE
IT WAS ELEVEN UPON MY SOUL I COUNTED EVERY STROKE THIS BROTHER OF YOURS WOULD PERSUADE ME OUT OF MY SENSES MISS MORLAND DO BUT LOOK AT MY HORSE
IT IS GETTING LATE AND YOUR RETINUE AT LEAST IS HUNGRY HE FLUNG OPEN THE COACH DOOR AND HIS HAT SWEPT THE GROUND ONCE MORE THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN PLAYED FITFULLY UPON HIS DARK GAUNT FACE
AFTER LISTENING AND AGREEING AS LONG AS SHE COULD WITH ALL THE CIVILITY AND DEFERENCE OF THE YOUTHFUL FEMALE MIND FEARFUL OF HAZARDING AN OPINION OF ITS OWN IN OPPOSITION TO THAT OF A SELF ASSURED MAN ESPECIALLY WHERE THE BEAUTY OF HER OWN SEX IS CONCERNED
WHETHER IN QUEST OF PASTRY MILLINERY OR EVEN AS IN THE PRESENT CASE OF YOUNG MEN ARE NOT DETAINED ON ONE SIDE OR OTHER BY CARRIAGES HORSEMEN OR CARTS
THE SITUATION OF SOME THE GROWTH OF THE REST AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS NOW PASSED BETWEEN THEM AND CONTINUED WITH ONLY ONE SMALL DIGRESSION ON JAMES'S PART IN PRAISE OF MISS THORPE TILL THEY REACHED PULTENEY STREET
THE MUTE APPEAL TRUST ME YOUR HIGHNESS HE SAID GRAVELY AND SHE ALLOWED HIM TO HAND HER INTO THE COACH A MOMENT LATER HE WAS UPON THE DRIVER'S BOX REINS IN HAND
YOUR ESCORT HAS FLED AS THOUGH PURSUED BY SOMETHING STRONGER THAN SHADOWS YOUR DRIVER HAS DESERTED YOUR HORSES ARE HALF DEAD YOU ARE INDEED AS YOU HAVE SAID POWERLESS AND YOU ARE BESIDES ALL THESE
HALF A MINUTE CONDUCTED THEM THROUGH THE PUMP YARD TO THE ARCHWAY OPPOSITE UNION PASSAGE BUT HERE THEY WERE STOPPED EVERYBODY ACQUAINTED WITH BATH MAY REMEMBER THE DIFFICULTIES OF CROSSING CHEAP STREET AT THIS POINT
AND THERE WAS A TINGE OF POLITE IRONY IN THE TONES BUT ALL PEOPLE ARE ALIKE IN THE MOUNTAINS THE KING AND THE THIEF THE PRINCESS AND THE JADE LIVE IN THE COMMON FOLD AND HIS HAT SWUNG SO LOW THAT IT TOUCHED THE GROUND
SHE IS JUST THE KIND OF YOUNG WOMAN I COULD WISH TO SEE YOU ATTACHED TO SHE HAS SO MUCH GOOD SENSE AND IS SO THOROUGHLY UNAFFECTED AND AMIABLE I ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO KNOW HER AND SHE SEEMS VERY FOND OF YOU SHE SAID THE HIGHEST THINGS IN YOUR PRAISE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
SUCH AS REPELLING BRIGANDS WHO SUDDENLY APPEAR UPON THE SCENE YES MAY I ASK WHY YOU DID NOT USE IT THIS EVENING BECAUSE IT IS LOCKED UP IN ONE OF MY BAGS I DON'T KNOW JUST WHICH ONE AND AUNT FANNY HAS THE KEY
FORTY AYE FIFTY FOR WHAT I CARE WELL I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN TOMORROW MIND I AM ENGAGED HOW DELIGHTFUL THAT WILL BE CRIED ISABELLA TURNING ROUND MY DEAREST CATHERINE I QUITE ENVY YOU
AT THE SAME INSTANT ANOTHER RAGGED STRANGER THEN TWO THREE FOUR OR FIVE APPEARED AS IF BY MAGIC SOME NEAR HER OTHERS APPROACHING FROM THE SHADOWS WHO
OUT DOOR LIFE IS NECESSARY FOR OUR HEALTH
PREVENTED HIS ACCEPTING THE INVITATION OF ONE FRIEND AND OBLIGED HIM TO HURRY AWAY AS SOON AS HE HAD SATISFIED THE DEMANDS OF THE OTHER
IT REQUIRES UNCOMMON STEADINESS OF REASON TO RESIST THE ATTRACTION OF BEING CALLED THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN THE WORLD
IF THE MAN HEARD HER HE GAVE NO EVIDENCE OF THE FACT HIS FACE WAS SET FORWARD AND HE WAS GUIDING THE HORSES WITH A FIRM UNQUIVERING HAND THE COACH RATTLED AND BOUNDED ALONG THE DANGEROUS WAY HEWN IN THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
BEVERLY CALHOUN SANK BACK INTO THE SEAT WEAK AND TERROR STRICKEN IT WAS PLAIN TO HER THAT THE HORSES WERE NOT RUNNING AWAY FOR THE MAN HAD BEEN LASHING THEM FURIOUSLY THERE WAS BUT ONE CONCLUSION
FOR SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE MOST DELIGHTED AND EXULTING AFFECTION ON HIS TWO YOUNGER SISTERS HE THEN BESTOWED AN EQUAL PORTION OF HIS FRATERNAL TENDERNESS FOR HE ASKED EACH OF THEM HOW THEY DID
LESS THAN A HUNDRED FEET FROM WHERE THE COACH WAS STANDING HE TURNED TO THE RIGHT AND WAS LOST AMONG THE ROCKS AHEAD FOUR HORSES COVERED WITH SWEAT WERE PANTING AND HEAVING AS IF IN GREAT DISTRESS AFTER THEIR MAD RUN
BEING CORRECTLY ADJUSTED CATHERINE WAS THEN LEFT TO THE LUXURY OF A RAISED RESTLESS AND FRIGHTENED IMAGINATION OVER THE PAGES OF UDOLPHO
HE WORE THE EXPRESSION OF A MAN TRAPPED AND SEEKING MEANS OF ESCAPE SUDDENLY HE DARTED BEHIND THE COACH ALMOST BRUSHING AGAINST BEVERLY'S HAT AS HE PASSED THE WINDOW SHE OPENED HER LIPS TO CALL TO HIM BUT EVEN AS SHE DID SO HE TOOK TO HIS HEELS
THESE MANNERS DID NOT PLEASE CATHERINE BUT HE WAS JAMES'S FRIEND AND ISABELLA'S BROTHER AND HER JUDGMENT WAS FURTHER BOUGHT OFF BY ISABELLA'S ASSURING HER WHEN THEY WITHDREW TO SEE THE NEW HAT THAT JOHN THOUGHT HER THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN THE WORLD
COVERING HIS PATCH CAREFULLY WITH HIS SLOUCHING HAT MY SERVANT SHE'S COLORED COLORED HE ASKED IN AMAZEMENT
IT IS INDEED A STREET OF SO IMPERTINENT A NATURE SO UNFORTUNATELY CONNECTED WITH THE GREAT LONDON AND OXFORD ROADS AND THE PRINCIPAL INN OF THE CITY THAT A DAY NEVER PASSES IN WHICH PARTIES OF LADIES HOWEVER IMPORTANT THEIR BUSINESS
YES SAID MORLAND WHO OVERHEARD THIS BUT YOU FORGET THAT YOUR HORSE WAS INCLUDED MY HORSE
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THEY ARE THIEVES OR ANGELS I RECKON I'LL HAVE TO TAKE WHAT COMES HE DOESN'T LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE AN ANGEL
A MISSTEP OR A FALSE TURN MIGHT EASILY START THE CLUMSY VEHICLE ROLLING DOWN THE DECLIVITY ON THE RIGHT THE CONVICT WAS TAKING DESPERATE CHANCES AND WITH A COOL CALCULATING BRAIN PREPARED TO LEAP TO THE GROUND IN CASE OF ACCIDENT
AND BESIDES YOU DO NOT KNOW THE WAY AREN'T YOU GOING TO ROB US DEMANDED BEVERLY HOPE SPRINGING TO THE SURFACE WITH A JOYFUL BOUND THE STRANGER LAUGHED HEARTILY AND SHOOK HIS HEAD DO WE NOT LOOK LIKE HONEST MEN
PLEASE PLEASE DON'T HURT HER COMPOSE YOURSELF SHE IS SAFE SAID THE LEADER BY THIS TIME IT WAS QUITE DARK AT A WORD FROM HIM TWO OR THREE MEN LIGHTED LANTERNS THE PICTURE WAS MORE WEIRD THAN EVER IN THE FITFUL GLOW
THE ONLY REWARD I CAN ASK IS FORGIVENESS FOR TRESPASSING UPON THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS YOU SHALL RECEIVE PARDON FOR ALL TRANSGRESSIONS BUT YOU MUST GET ME TO SOME PLACE OF SAFETY SAID BEVERLY EAGERLY AND QUICKLY TOO YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE ADDED
SO CONTENTEDLY WAS SHE ENDEAVOURING TO ENSURE A PLEASANT WALK TO HIM WHO BROUGHT THE DOUBLE RECOMMENDATION OF BEING HER BROTHER'S FRIEND AND HER FRIEND'S BROTHER SO PURE AND UNCOQUETTISH WERE HER FEELINGS THAT
AND THREADING THE GUTTERS OF THAT INTERESTING ALLEY
AND SAVE HIMSELF WITHOUT A THOUGHT FOR THE VICTIMS INSIDE STOP TURN AROUND SHE CRIED IN A FRENZY
WHO IN HEAVEN'S NAME ARE YOU SHE FALTERED
THANK YOU SAID CATHERINE
SHE UTTERED THE LAST OBSERVATION IN A LOUD VOICE AND IT HAD ITS EFFECT FOR THE LEADER CAME TO HER SIDE WITH LONG STRIDES CONVINCE YOUR SERVANT THAT WE MEAN NO HARM YOUR HIGHNESS HE SAID EAGERLY A NEW DEFERENCE IN HIS VOICE AND MANNER
A THIRD INDEED NO NO I DID NOT COME TO BATH TO DRIVE MY SISTERS ABOUT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD JOKE FAITH MORLAND MUST TAKE CARE OF YOU THIS BROUGHT ON A DIALOGUE OF CIVILITIES BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO
THE AWFUL ROCKING AND THE JOLTING GREW LESS SEVERE
BUT WHY HAVE YOU STOPPED US IN THIS MANNER STOPPED YOU CRIED THE MAN WITH THE PATCH I IMPLORE YOU TO UNSAY THAT YOUR HIGHNESS
WHY SHE'S A NEGRESS DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT A COLORED PERSON IS YOU MEAN SHE IS A SLAVE A BLACK SLAVE WE DON'T OWN SLAVES ANY MO' MORE HE LOOKED MORE PUZZLED THAN EVER
HE RAN IT A FEW WEEKS TILL I BELIEVE IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT
HE CRIED WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND TOWARD HIS COMPANIONS BEVERLY LOOKED DUBIOUS
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOT ONE WHO LOOKED AS THOUGH HE POSSESSED A COMPLETE OUTFIT OF WEARING APPAREL POOR WAYFARERS MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HIGHNESS REPLIED THE TALL VAGABOND BOWING LOW TO HER SURPRISE HE SPOKE IN VERY GOOD ENGLISH HIS VOICE WAS CLEAR
I OH YOUR HIGHNESS I AM BALDOS THE GOAT HUNTER A POOR SUBJECT FOR REWARD AT YOUR HANDS I MAY AS WELL ADMIT THAT I AM A POACHER AND HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT TO THE PROSPERITY OF YOUR HILLS
SO WHAT MATTERS AFTER ALL WE RESERVE THE RIGHT HOWEVER TO DO HOMAGE TO THE QUEEN WHO RULES OVER THESE WISE OLD HILLS I OFFER YOU THE HUMBLE SERVICES OF MYSELF AND MY COMPANIONS WE ARE YOURS TO COMMAND
IT WAS HAVE YOU EVER READ UDOLPHO MISTER THORPE UDOLPHO OH LORD NOT I I NEVER READ NOVELS I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO CATHERINE HUMBLED AND ASHAMED
AS THEY MET MISSUS THORPE WHO HAD DESCRIED THEM FROM ABOVE IN THE PASSAGE AH MOTHER HOW DO YOU DO SAID HE GIVING HER A HEARTY SHAKE OF THE HAND WHERE DID YOU GET THAT QUIZ OF A HAT IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE AN OLD WITCH
AND ON FINDING WHITHER THEY WERE GOING IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE GENTLEMEN SHOULD ACCOMPANY THEM TO EDGAR'S BUILDINGS AND PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO MISSUS THORPE JAMES AND ISABELLA LED THE WAY AND SO WELL SATISFIED WAS THE LATTER WITH HER LOT
CATHERINE BY WHOM THIS MEETING WAS WHOLLY UNEXPECTED RECEIVED HER BROTHER WITH THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE AND HE BEING OF A VERY AMIABLE DISPOSITION AND SINCERELY ATTACHED TO HER GAVE EVERY PROOF ON HIS SIDE OF EQUAL SATISFACTION
SET OFF TO WALK TOGETHER TO MISTER ALLEN'S AND JAMES AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON THEM SAID WELL CATHERINE HOW DO YOU LIKE MY FRIEND THORPE INSTEAD OF ANSWERING AS SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE HAD THERE BEEN NO FRIENDSHIP AND NO FLATTERY IN THE CASE I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL
HER TENDER BODY TOSSED FURIOUSLY ABOUT WITH THE SWAY OF THE VEHICLE
BUT APART FROM THIS HER QUICK BRAIN WAS EVOLVING ALL SORTS OF POSSIBLE ENDINGS NONE SHORT OF ABSOLUTE DISASTER EVEN AS SHE PRAYED THAT SOMETHING MIGHT INTERVENE TO CHECK THE MAD RUSH
MAY BE PROUD OF INDEED I AM SHE REPLIED I LOVE HER EXCEEDINGLY AND AM DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT YOU LIKE HER TOO YOU HARDLY MENTIONED ANYTHING OF HER WHEN YOU WROTE TO ME AFTER YOUR VISIT THERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT I SHOULD SOON SEE YOU MYSELF
A PROLONGED GROAN PROVED TO BEVERLY THAT AUNT FANNY HAD SCREWED UP SUFFICIENT COURAGE TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW MY OLD SERVANT SHE HALF WHISPERED THEN AS SEVERAL OF THE MEN STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR BUT SHE IS OLD AND WOULDN'T HARM A FLY
I NEED NOT ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE HAPPY HERE MY DEAR CATHERINE WITH SUCH A COMPANION AND FRIEND AS ISABELLA THORPE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BE OTHERWISE
I'M I'M NOT AFRAID BRAVELY SHIVERED BEVERLY IT IS MOST DANGEROUS I HAVE A REVOLVER THE WEAK LITTLE VOICE WENT ON OHO WHAT IS IT FOR
BUT HIS FRIEND DISREGARDED THEM ALL HE HAD A SURER TEST OF DISTANCE I KNOW IT MUST BE FIVE AND TWENTY SAID HE BY THE TIME WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT IT IS NOW HALF AFTER ONE WE DROVE OUT OF THE INN YARD AT TETBURY AS THE TOWN CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN
I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN CAMILLA YES
BUT THIS DETESTATION THOUGH SO JUST WAS OF SHORT DURATION FOR SHE LOOKED AGAIN AND EXCLAIMED DELIGHTFUL MISTER MORLAND AND MY BROTHER GOOD HEAVEN TIS JAMES WAS UTTERED AT THE SAME MOMENT BY CATHERINE
IS YO DAID YIT MISS BEV'LY IS DE END CAME MOANED AUNT FANNY BEVERLY COULD NOT REPRESS A SMILE I AM QUITE ALIVE AUNTIE THESE MEN WILL NOT HURT US THEY ARE VERY NICE GENTLEMEN
SAID THE MAN MOCKINGLY BEVERLY LOOKED AT HIM APPEALINGLY
HER BROTHER TOLD HER THAT IT WAS TWENTY THREE MILES THREE AND TWENTY CRIED THORPE FIVE AND TWENTY IF IT IS AN INCH MORLAND REMONSTRATED PLEADED THE AUTHORITY OF ROAD BOOKS INNKEEPERS AND MILESTONES
AND TOO MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN UNLESS HE WERE EASY WHERE HE OUGHT TO BE CIVIL AND IMPUDENT WHERE HE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO BE EASY HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING IT FROM TETBURY MISS MORLAND I DO NOT KNOW THE DISTANCE
AND BY JOHN'S ENGAGING HER BEFORE THEY PARTED TO DANCE WITH HIM THAT EVENING HAD SHE BEEN OLDER OR VAINER SUCH ATTACKS MIGHT HAVE DONE LITTLE
YES VERY KIND I NEVER WAS SO HAPPY BEFORE
WE ARE NOT SO FAR FROM THE WORLD AFTER ALL WE ROUGH PEOPLE OF THE HILLS
THE MAN SHE HAD FIRST OBSERVED STOPPED NEAR THE HORSES HEADS AND PEERED INTENTLY AT HER FROM BENEATH A BROAD AND RAKISH HAT HE WAS TALL AND APPEARED TO BE MORE RESPECTABLY CLAD THAN HIS FELLOWS
HE SAID LIGHTLY THE HORSES HAVE RESTED I THINK
IS NOT SHE YES VERY MUCH INDEED I FANCY MISTER ALLEN THINKS HER THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN BATH I DARE SAY HE DOES AND I DO NOT KNOW ANY MAN WHO IS A BETTER JUDGE OF BEAUTY THAN MISTER ALLEN
EVEN THE HILLS HAVE EYES AND EARS BEVERLY LISTENED WITH INCREASING PERPLEXITY IT WAS TRUE THAT SHE HAD LEFT SAINT PETERSBURG ON SUNDAY THAT THE UNPRECEDENTED FLOODS HAD STOPPED ALL RAILWAY TRAFFIC IN THE HILLS
THE HORSE WAS IMMEDIATELY CHECKED WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH ALMOST THREW HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES
THERE HAS NOT BEEN A TOLERABLY DECENT ONE COME OUT SINCE TOM JONES EXCEPT THE MONK I READ THAT T'OTHER DAY BUT AS FOR ALL THE OTHERS THEY ARE THE STUPIDEST THINGS IN CREATION I THINK YOU MUST LIKE UDOLPHO IF YOU WERE TO READ IT IT IS SO VERY INTERESTING
MAY I ASK YOUR HIGHNESS HOW DO YOU INTEND TO REACH EDELWEISS IN YOUR PRESENT CONDITION
AND I DEFY ANY MAN IN ENGLAND TO MAKE MY HORSE GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR IN HARNESS THAT MAKES IT EXACTLY TWENTY FIVE YOU HAVE LOST AN HOUR SAID MORLAND IT WAS ONLY TEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE CAME FROM TETBURY TEN O'CLOCK
VERY VERY MUCH INDEED ISABELLA PARTICULARLY
COMPELLING HER TO TRAVEL FOR MANY MILES BY STAGE AND THAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS CONFUSING HER IN SOME STRANGE WAY WITH THE PRINCESS YETIVE THE NEWS HAD EVIDENTLY SPED THROUGH AXPHAIN AND THE HILLS WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF FIRE
I WOULD NOT SELL MY HORSE FOR A HUNDRED ARE YOU FOND OF AN OPEN CARRIAGE MISS MORLAND YES VERY I HAVE HARDLY EVER AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING IN ONE BUT I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF IT I AM GLAD OF IT I WILL DRIVE YOU OUT IN MINE EVERY DAY
I KNOW OF A PLACE WHERE YOU MAY SPEND THE NIGHT COMFORTABLY AND BE REFRESHED FOR THE ROUGH JOURNEY TO MORROW TO MORROW HOW CAN I GO ON I AM ALONE SHE CRIED DESPAIRINGLY
AND SHE WAS NOW FATED TO FEEL AND LAMENT IT ONCE MORE FOR AT THE VERY MOMENT OF COMING OPPOSITE TO UNION PASSAGE
AND WORE AN ODD UNCOUTH GARB THE FAILING LIGHT TOLD HER THAT HE WAS NOT ONE OF HER LATE PROTECTORS SHE SHRANK BACK WITH A FAINT CRY OF ALARM READY TO FLY TO THE PROTECTING ARMS OF HOPELESS AUNT FANNY IF HER UNCERTAIN LEGS COULD CARRY HER
RENEWED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HIS GIG YOU WILL FIND HOWEVER MISS MORLAND IT WOULD BE RECKONED A CHEAP THING BY SOME PEOPLE FOR I MIGHT HAVE SOLD IT FOR TEN GUINEAS MORE THE NEXT DAY JACKSON OF ORIEL BID ME SIXTY AT ONCE MORLAND WAS WITH ME AT THE TIME
AND THEN THE COACH STOPPED WITH A MIGHTY LURCH DRAGGING HERSELF FROM THE CORNER POOR BEVERLY CALHOUN NO LONGER A DISDAINFUL HEROINE
I HOPE YOU WILL BE A GREAT DEAL TOGETHER WHILE YOU ARE IN BATH SHE IS A MOST AMIABLE GIRL SUCH A SUPERIOR UNDERSTANDING HOW FOND ALL THE FAMILY ARE OF HER SHE IS EVIDENTLY THE GENERAL FAVOURITE
HE WAS DELIBERATELY TAKING HER FARTHER INTO THE MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES HIS PURPOSE KNOWN ONLY TO HIMSELF A HUNDRED TERRORS PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO HER
I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN HILL TOMORROW THANK YOU BUT WILL NOT YOUR HORSE WANT REST REST HE HAS ONLY COME THREE AND TWENTY MILES TODAY ALL NONSENSE NOTHING RUINS HORSES SO MUCH AS REST NOTHING KNOCKS THEM UP SO SOON
LOOK AT HIS LOINS ONLY SEE HOW HE MOVES THAT HORSE CANNOT GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR TIE HIS LEGS AND HE WILL GET ON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY GIG MISS MORLAND
IT REMAINED ONLY FOR HER TO IMPRESS UPON AUNT FANNY THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS RESOLUTION WHAT WISE OLD HILLS THEY MUST BE SHE SAID WITH EVASIVE ENTHUSIASM YOU CANNOT EXPECT ME TO ADMIT HOWEVER THAT I AM THE PRINCESS SHE WENT ON
WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED WITH GREAT KINDNESS BY MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN INVITED BY THE FORMER TO DINE WITH THEM AND SUMMONED BY THE LATTER TO GUESS THE PRICE AND WEIGH THE MERITS OF A NEW MUFF AND TIPPET A PRE ENGAGEMENT IN EDGAR'S BUILDINGS
I HEARD THE SHOOTING CRIED BEVERLY IT WAS THAT WHICH PUT MY ESCORT TO FLIGHT THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SOLDIERS OF GRAUSTARK THEN YOUR HIGHNESS QUITE GALLANTLY THEY WERE COSSACKS OR WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM
THIS CRITIQUE THE JUSTNESS OF WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY LOST ON POOR CATHERINE BROUGHT THEM TO THE DOOR OF MISSUS THORPE'S LODGINGS AND THE FEELINGS OF THE DISCERNING AND UNPREJUDICED READER OF CAMILLA GAVE WAY TO THE FEELINGS OF THE DUTIFUL AND AFFECTIONATE SON
WITH SOME HESITATION FROM THE FEAR OF MORTIFYING HIM NO SURE WAS IT AYE I REMEMBER SO IT WAS I WAS THINKING OF THAT OTHER STUPID BOOK WRITTEN BY THAT WOMAN THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SHE WHO MARRIED THE FRENCH EMIGRANT
IN AFTER LIFE SHE WAS ABLE TO PICTURE IN HER MIND'S EYE ALL THE DETAILS OF THAT TABLEAU IN THE MOUNTAIN PASS THE HOPELESS COACH THE STEAMING HORSES THE RAKISH BANDIT AND HIS PICTURESQUE MEN THE TOWERING CRAGS
HE ASKED FIFTY GUINEAS I CLOSED WITH HIM DIRECTLY THREW DOWN THE MONEY AND THE CARRIAGE WAS MINE AND I AM SURE SAID CATHERINE
AUNT FANNY WAS STILL MOANING AND PRAYING BY TURNS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CARRIAGE DARKNESS WAS SETTLING DOWN UPON THE PASS AND OBJECTS A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY WERE SWALLOWED BY THE GLOOM THERE WAS NO SOUND SAVE THE BLOWING OF THE TIRED ANIMALS
DRIVEN ALONG ON BAD PAVEMENT BY A MOST KNOWING LOOKING COACHMAN WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE THAT COULD MOST FITLY ENDANGER THE LIVES OF HIMSELF HIS COMPANION AND HIS HORSE OH THESE ODIOUS GIGS SAID ISABELLA LOOKING UP HOW I DETEST THEM
I HAVE NEVER READ IT YOU HAD NO LOSS I ASSURE YOU IT IS THE HORRIDEST NONSENSE YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD IN IT BUT AN OLD MAN'S PLAYING AT SEE SAW AND LEARNING LATIN UPON MY SOUL THERE IS NOT
BUT SHE FORCED OPEN THE STUBBORN COACHDOOR AND SCRAMBLED TO THE GROUND LOOKING FRANTICALLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR A SINGLE SIGN OF HOPE IN THE MOST DESPAIRING TERROR SHE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED SHE STARTED TOWARD THE LEAD HORSES
EVERY MAN YOU MEET IN GRAUSTARK IS NOT A BRIGAND I TRUST FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE SIMPLE HUNTERS AND NOT WHAT WE MAY SEEM IT IS FORTUNATE THAT YOU HAVE FALLEN INTO HONEST HANDS THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE COACH HE ASKED QUICKLY ALERT
ASKED THE LEADER PUTTING AWAY HIS BRIEF SHOW OF INDIGNATION
I HAVE NEVER LIKED CATS SAID MISSUS GARDNER REMOTELY I LOVE THEM SAID DOROTHY THEY ARE SO NICE AND SELFISH DOGS ARE TOO GOOD AND UNSELFISH THEY MAKE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE BUT CATS ARE GLORIOUSLY HUMAN
AND ALINE WOULD NEVER LIKE HER THOUGH MISSUS GARDNER MIGHT BE WON ALTOGETHER ANNE SIGHED WITH RELIEF WHEN THE ORDEAL WAS OVER OF ALL SAD WORDS OF TONGUE OR PEN THE SADDEST ARE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUOTED PRISCILLA TRAGICALLY LIFTING THE CUSHION
PICKING UP MAGOG SHE SAT DOWN ON THE CUSHION UNDER WHICH WAS SECRETED PRISCILLA'S CHOCOLATE CAKE PRISCILLA AND ANNE EXCHANGED AGONIZED GLANCES BUT COULD DO NOTHING
LET'S ALL GO UP TOWN AND GET DRUNK SUGGESTED PHIL I AM GOING TO SQUANDER IT IN A WILD SOULLESS REVEL OF SOME SORT DECLARED ANNE GAILY AT ALL EVENTS IT ISN'T TAINTED MONEY LIKE THE CHECK I GOT FOR THAT HORRIBLE RELIABLE BAKING POWDER STORY
THE OLD WOMAN WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED WHEN SHE HEARD OF THIS NEW ADDITION TO HER FAMILY BUT SHE DID NOT GIVE WAY TO DESPAIR SHE SENT FOR THE CARPENTER AGAIN AND HAD HIM BUILD ANOTHER ADDITION TO HER HOUSE AS THE PICTURE SHOWS
THERE IS SO MUCH IN THE WORLD FOR US ALL IF WE ONLY HAVE THE EYES TO SEE IT AND THE HEART TO LOVE IT AND THE HAND TO GATHER IT TO OURSELVES SO MUCH IN MEN AND WOMEN SO MUCH IN ART AND LITERATURE SO MUCH EVERYWHERE IN WHICH TO DELIGHT
THE WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE SHE HAD SO MANY CHILDREN
THAT HER CARD WAS FULL WHEN HE CAME TO ASK HER FOR A DANCE AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE SAT WITH THE GIRLS BEFORE THE DYING EMBERS AT PATTY'S PLACE REMOVING THE SPRING CHILLINESS FROM THEIR SATIN SKINS NONE CHATTED MORE BLITHELY THAN SHE OF THE DAY'S EVENTS
MEANING A LOAD PACKED ON THE OUTSIDE OF A VAN IN AMERICA THE LOAD IS PACKED ON THE INSIDE OF A MAN
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT OUT OF YOUR REDMOND COURSE ANNE MURMURED PRISCILLA ASIDE I THINK SAID ANNE SLOWLY THAT I REALLY HAVE LEARNED TO LOOK UPON EACH LITTLE HINDRANCE AS A JEST AND EACH GREAT ONE AS THE FORESHADOWING OF VICTORY
ALSO HAD FOUR SMALL CHILDREN THAT MUST BE CARED FOR IN SOME WAY THE OLD WOMAN HAVING TAKEN THE OTHER TWELVE COULD NOT WELL REFUSE TO ADOPT THESE LITTLE ORPHANS ALSO I MAY AS WELL HAVE SIXTEEN AS A DOZEN SHE SAID WITH A SIGH
THE WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE
OR DOROTHY'S ARDENT IMPULSIVE GOOD WISHES IT WAS OF ONE STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE PANG THAT SPOILED THIS LONG EXPECTED DAY FOR HER AND LEFT IN IT A CERTAIN FAINT BUT ENDURING FLAVOR OF BITTERNESS
WITH WHITE GRAVEL PATHS AND MANY BEDS OF BRIGHT COLORED FLOWERS THE OLD WOMAN WAS VERY HAPPY AND CONTENTED THERE UNTIL ONE DAY SHE RECEIVED A LETTER SAYING THAT HER DAUGHTER HANNAH WAS DEAD AND HAD SENT HER FAMILY OF FIVE CHILDREN TO THEIR GRANDMOTHER TO BE TAKEN CARE OF
WITH A TINY PINK ENAMEL HEART AS A PENDANT ON THE ACCOMPANYING CARD WAS WRITTEN WITH ALL GOOD WISHES FROM YOUR OLD CHUM GILBERT ANNE LAUGHING OVER THE MEMORY THE ENAMEL HEART CONJURED UP THE FATAL DAY WHEN
WHO HANDS YOU A MINT AND GIVES YOU A SWEET SPIRIT FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY A BUN JURY TWELVE MEN CHOSEN TO DECIDE WHO HAS THE BETTER LAWYER
TO SHOW AUNT JAMESINA THE CHOCOLATE CAKE SHE HAD JUST ICED AT THIS AUSPICIOUS MOMENT THE KNOCKER SOUNDED NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO IT SAVE PHIL WHO SPRANG UP AND OPENED IT EXPECTING A BOY WITH THE HAT SHE HAD BOUGHT THAT MORNING
IF YOU ARE GOING TO EMBARK IN LITERATURE THOUGH TO BE SURE ADDED
COLLEGE CIRCLES EXPECTED THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HER ENGAGEMENT TO ROY ANY DAY ANNE EXPECTED IT HERSELF YET JUST BEFORE SHE LEFT PATTY'S PLACE FOR CONVOCATION SHE FLUNG ROY'S VIOLETS ASIDE AND PUT GILBERT'S LILIES OF THE VALLEY IN THEIR PLACE
SO LIKE A MAN THOUGHT ANNE SCORNFULLY SHALL YOU BE HOME SATURDAY AFTERNOON ASKED ROY YES MY MOTHER AND SISTERS ARE COMING TO CALL ON YOU SAID ROY QUIETLY SOMETHING WENT OVER ANNE WHICH MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS A THRILL
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX THE GARDNERS'CALL HERE IS A LETTER WITH AN INDIAN STAMP FOR YOU AUNT JIMSIE SAID PHIL HERE ARE THREE FOR STELLA AND TWO FOR PRIS AND A GLORIOUS FAT ONE FOR ME FROM JO
AND SOON PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO LOOK AT THE QUEER HOUSE AND THEY USUALLY WENT AWAY LAUGHING THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT MIND THIS AT ALL SHE WAS TOO BUSY TO BE ANGRY
SOLUS ALONE ALONE IN THE COLD AFTER DINNER SIT A WHILE AFTER SUPPER WALK A MILE AND EVERY MEAL'S A SUPPER TO THE HOBO J
THIS MISFORTUNE RUINED ALL THE OLD WOMAN'S DREAMS OF QUIET BUT THE NEXT DAY THE CHILDREN ARRIVED THREE BOYS AND TWO GIRLS AND SHE MADE THE BEST OF IT AND GAVE THEM THE BEDS HER OWN DAUGHTERS HAD ONCE OCCUPIED AND HER OWN COT AS WELL
BUT WOULD IT NOT BE SOMETHING OF AN ORDEAL GOSSIP HAD FILTERED TO ANNE REGARDING THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE GARDNERS VIEWED THE INFATUATION OF SON AND BROTHER ROY MUST HAVE BROUGHT PRESSURE TO BEAR IN THE MATTER OF THIS CALL ANNE KNEW SHE WOULD BE WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE
WHO NEVER SPOILED A COMPLIMENT BY MISPLACED ECONOMY BUT I MISTRUST YOU HAVEN'T ANY TOO MUCH SENSE YET IT'S NOT TO BE EXPECTED OF COURSE EXPERIENCE TEACHES SENSE YOU CAN'T LEARN IT IN A COLLEGE COURSE
YOU HAVE TWO DELIGHTFUL OLD CHINA DOGS THERE
ANNE'S EYES SHONE ALL THAT DAY LITERARY AMBITIONS SPROUTED AND BUDDED IN HER BRAIN THEIR EXHILARATION ACCOMPANIED HER TO JENNIE COOPER'S WALKING PARTY AND NOT EVEN THE SIGHT OF GILBERT AND CHRISTINE WALKING JUST AHEAD OF HER AND ROY
WELL I SUPPOSE THE LORD DOESN'T REGARD THE EARS OF A MAN SAID AUNT JAMESINA GRAVELY DROPPING ALL FURTHER CRITICISM OF MOODY SPURGEON
AN IMPLEMENT EMPLOYED BY MEN OF ACQUISITIVE NATURES WHO CANNOT AFFORD SEATS IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE JOB AN UNCERTAIN COMMODITY REGULATED BY A UNION CARD JOCKEY
THE HOUSE PRESENTED A VERY QUEER APPEARANCE NOW BUT SHE DID NOT MIND THAT SO LONG AS THE BABIES WERE COMFORTABLE I SHALL NOT HAVE TO BUILD AGAIN SHE SAID AND THAT IS ONE SATISFACTION I HAVE NOW NO MORE DAUGHTERS TO DIE AND LEAVE ME THEIR CHILDREN
RUSTY AND JOSEPH LEFT TO THEMSELVES BEGAN A GAME OF CHASE AND SPRANG MADLY INTO MISSUS GARDNER'S SILKEN LAP AND OUT OF IT IN THEIR WILD CAREER MISSUS GARDNER LIFTED HER LORGNETTE
ONE ENERGETIC TWIST AND IT GAVE WAY ANNE THRUST THE BROKEN TRINKET INTO HER POCKET HER HANDS WERE TREMBLING AND HER EYES WERE SMARTING BUT SHE WAS THE GAYEST OF ALL THE GAY REVELLERS THAT NIGHT AND TOLD GILBERT UNREGRETFULLY
AND HAS MARRIED THEM ALL HAPPILY SHE IS SURELY ENTITLED TO PASS HER REMAINING DAYS IN PEACE AND COMFORT SHE LIVED IN A PECULIAR LITTLE HOUSE THAT LOOKED SOMETHING LIKE THIS PICTURE
IT WAS AN OLD SKETCH I FOUND IN MY BOX I RE WROTE IT AND SENT IT IN BUT I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT IT COULD BE ACCEPTED BECAUSE IT HAD NO PLOT SAID ANNE RECALLING THE BITTER EXPERIENCE OF AVERIL'S ATONEMENT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THAT TEN DOLLARS ANNE
ANNE WALKED IN SILENCE PHIL CHATTERED OF MANY THINGS SUDDENLY SHE SAID
THERE ARE HEAPS OF THINGS YOU NEVER LEARN AT SCHOOL QUOTED STELLA HAVE YOU LEARNED ANYTHING AT REDMOND EXCEPT DEAD LANGUAGES AND GEOMETRY AND SUCH TRASH QUERIED AUNT JAMESINA OH YES I THINK WE HAVE AUNTY PROTESTED ANNE
LIES HAVE NO LEGS THAT'S WHY WE ALL HAVE TO STAND FOR THEM JACK AN INSTRUMENT REQUIRING A STRONG ARM AND USED FOR RAISING HEAVY WEIGHTS OR FOR PULLING OFF THE BOOTS
SHE HAD NEVER MET ANY OF ROY'S FAMILY SHE REALIZED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIS STATEMENT AND IT HAD SOMEHOW AN IRREVOCABLENESS ABOUT IT THAT CHILLED HER I SHALL BE GLAD TO SEE THEM SHE SAID FLATLY AND THEN WONDERED IF SHE REALLY WOULD BE GLAD SHE OUGHT TO BE OF COURSE
THE CHILDREN LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN SURPRISE FOR THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE BREAD AND THEN ONE OF THEM CONFESSED AND TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY OF HOW THEY HAD FRIGHTENED THE BAKER MAN FOR SAYING HE WOULD SEND THEM TO THE POOR HOUSE
IF YOU LIVE LONG ENOUGH BOTH WISHES WILL COME TRUE SAID ANNE CALMLY IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO BE SERENE YOU'RE AT HOME IN PHILOSOPHY I'M NOT AND WHEN I THINK OF THAT HORRIBLE PAPER TOMORROW I QUAIL IF I SHOULD FAIL IN IT WHAT WOULD JO SAY
SAID ANNE NEVER MIND I BEGIN FAINTLY TO DISCERN CLEAR WATER AHEAD WHERE NO EXAMINATION BREAKERS LOOM GIRLS DO YOU CAN YOU REALIZE THAT OUR REDMOND LIFE IS ALMOST OVER I CAN'T SAID ANNE SORROWFULLY
TO CON OR JOSH JOLLY BOAT THE SHIP OF STATE JUDGE ONE WHO SITS ON A BENCH IN A COURT FRAMES SENTENCES AND FINISHES CROOKS FOR A LIVING AND SWEARS CONTINUALLY
ANNE KNEW SHE WAS ROY'S FAVORITE SISTER AND WARMED TO HER SHE WOULD HAVE LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE ROY IF SHE HAD HAD DREAMY DARK EYES INSTEAD OF ROGUISH HAZEL ONES
THEN SHE PUT THREE NEW COTS IN THE NEW PART FOR THE BABIES TO SLEEP IN AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY WERE JUST AS COZY AND COMFORTABLE AS PEAS IN A POD THE GRANDMOTHER WAS A LIVELY OLD WOMAN FOR ONE OF HER YEARS
YOU DON'T ACT AS IF YOU WERE BY TIMES SAID AUNT JAMESINA SEVERELY OH AUNT JIMSIE HAVEN'T WE BEEN PRETTY GOOD GIRLS TAKE US BY AND LARGE THESE THREE WINTERS YOU'VE MOTHERED US PLEADED PHIL
THEY WILL DRIVE ME CRAZY SOME DAY ANYHOW SO A FEW MORE WILL NOT MATTER AT ALL ONCE MORE SHE SENT FOR THE CARPENTER AND BADE HIM BUILD A THIRD ADDITION TO THE HOUSE AND WHEN IT WAS COMPLETED SHE ADDED FOUR MORE COTS TO THE DOZEN THAT WERE ALREADY IN USE
JACK POT AN INSTRUMENT REQUIRING A STRONG HAND AND USED FOR RAISING HEAVY BETS OR FOR PULLING OFF THE STAKES JAG FROM THE SPANISH WORD ZAGA
AND THE FURNITURE TO SHOW A GOOD MANY SCRATCHES AND BRUISES BUT THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED TO LOOK AFTER THEM AS WELL AS SHE WAS ABLE UNTIL SARAH HER THIRD DAUGHTER ALSO DIED AND THREE MORE CHILDREN WERE SENT TO THEIR GRANDMOTHER TO BE BROUGHT UP
AND THE FLOWER BEDS TRAMPLED INTO SHAPELESS MASSES BY THIRTY TWO LITTLE FEET THAT RAN ABOUT FROM MORN TILL NIGHT BUT THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT COMPLAIN AT THIS
A FICTITIOUS QUALITY IN FEMALES REALLY SUSPICION IRRITANT SOMETHING WHICH IRRITATES COUNTER IRRITANT A WOMAN SHOPPING ISLAND
AND WHEN ALL THE SIXTEEN SMALL INDIANS RUSHED FROM THE BUSHES AND FLOURISHED THEIR TOMAHAWKS HE TOOK TO HIS HEELS AND RAN DOWN THE HILL AS FAST AS HE COULD GO WHEN THE GRANDMOTHER RETURNED SHE ASKED WHERE IS THE BREAD FOR YOUR SUPPER
SUMMING UP I THINK THAT IS WHAT REDMOND HAS GIVEN ME I SHALL HAVE TO FALL BACK ON ANOTHER PROFESSOR WOODLEIGH QUOTATION TO EXPRESS WHAT IT HAS DONE FOR ME SAID PRISCILLA YOU REMEMBER THAT HE SAID IN HIS ADDRESS
THE YOUNGSTERS WERE LIKE ALL OTHER CHILDREN AND GOT INTO MISCHIEF ONCE IN AWHILE BUT THE OLD WOMAN HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH CHILDREN AND MANAGED TO KEEP THEM IN ORDER VERY WELL WHILE THEY QUICKLY LEARNED TO OBEY HER AND GENERALLY DID AS THEY WERE BID
AND THERE WAS SUCH AN UPROAR THAT THEIR GRANDMOTHER HAD TO PUT COTTON IN HER EARS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT LOSE HER HEARING BUT SHE KEPT HER PROMISE AND MADE THEM EAT THEIR BROTH WITHOUT ANY BREAD FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO BREAD TO GIVE THEM THEN SHE STOOD THEM IN A ROW AND UNDRESSED THEM
SO THAT THE POOR GRANDMOTHER WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED THE ONLY PEACE SHE EVER GOT WAS WHEN THEY WERE ALL SAFELY TUCKED IN THEIR LITTLE COTS AND WERE SOUND ASLEEP FOR THEN AT LEAST SHE WAS FREE FROM WORRY AND HAD A CHANCE TO GATHER HER SCATTERED WITS
NO SAID ANNE I THINK IT'S TRUE SAID PHIL LIGHTLY ANNE DID NOT SPEAK IN THE DARKNESS SHE FELT HER FACE BURNING SHE SLIPPED HER HAND INSIDE HER COLLAR AND CAUGHT AT THE GOLD CHAIN
AND OUT ONE WHO IS JUST OUT OF IDEAS IDLE USELESS IDOLIZE TO MAKE USELESS IMPECUNIOUS TO BE IN A STATE OF POVERTY
SHE GAVE THEM SOME BROTH WITHOUT ANY BREAD AND WHIPPED THEM ALL SOUNDLY AND SENT THEM TO BED
BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THEM SETTLED IN THEIR NEW HOME WHEN MARGARET ANOTHER OF HER DAUGHTERS DIED AND SENT FOUR MORE CHILDREN TO HER MOTHER TO BE TAKEN CARE OF THE OLD WOMAN SCARCELY KNEW WHERE TO KEEP THIS NEW FLOCK THAT HAD COME TO HER FOLD
BUT HER EYES WANDERED TO ANOTHER BOX ON HER TABLE IT WAS FILLED WITH LILIES OF THE VALLEY AS FRESH AND FRAGRANT AS THOSE WHICH BLOOMED IN THE GREEN GABLES YARD WHEN JUNE CAME TO AVONLEA
THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU ANNE EXCEPT A CIRCULAR NOBODY NOTICED ANNE'S FLUSH AS SHE TOOK THE THIN LETTER PHIL TOSSED HER CARELESSLY BUT A FEW MINUTES LATER PHIL LOOKED UP TO SEE A TRANSFIGURED ANNE HONEY WHAT GOOD THING HAS HAPPENED
THANKFUL THAT ONE OF ROY'S SISTERS WAS LIKABLE
COULD QUITE SUBDUE THE SPARKLE OF HER STARRY HOPES NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS NOT SO RAPT FROM THINGS OF EARTH AS TO BE UNABLE TO NOTICE THAT CHRISTINE'S WALK WAS DECIDEDLY UNGRACEFUL BUT I SUPPOSE GILBERT LOOKS ONLY AT HER FACE
MY DAUGHTER USED TO WRITE STORIES BEFORE SHE WENT TO THE FOREIGN FIELD BUT NOW SHE HAS TURNED HER ATTENTION TO HIGHER THINGS SHE USED TO SAY HER MOTTO WAS NEVER WRITE A LINE YOU WOULD BE ASHAMED TO READ AT YOUR OWN FUNERAL YOU'D BETTER TAKE THAT FOR YOURS ANNE
MAKE A JEST OF YOUR DIFFICULTIES BUT OVERCOME THEM ISN'T THAT WORTH LEARNING AUNT JIMSIE YES IT IS DEARIE WHEN YOU'VE LEARNED TO LAUGH AT THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE LAUGHED AT AND NOT TO LAUGH AT THOSE THAT SHOULDN'T YOU'VE GOT WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING
A TRIFLE FORCED ALINE GARDNER WAS A YOUNGER EDITION OF HER MOTHER LACKING THE CORDIALITY SHE ENDEAVORED TO BE NICE BUT SUCCEEDED ONLY IN BEING HAUGHTY AND PATRONIZING DOROTHY GARDNER WAS SLIM AND JOLLY AND RATHER TOMBOYISH
AND ANY ONE WHO HASN'T CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT IT IS SO THERE IS NO NEED OF DEFINING IT THE BUSY DAYS FLEW BY AND EXAMINATIONS WERE OVER ANNE TOOK HIGH HONORS IN ENGLISH PRISCILLA TOOK HONORS IN CLASSICS AND PHIL IN MATHEMATICS
WE'VE LEARNED THE TRUTH OF WHAT PROFESSOR WOODLEIGH TOLD US LAST PHILOMATHIC SAID PHIL HE SAID HUMOR IS THE SPICIEST CONDIMENT IN THE FEAST OF EXISTENCE LAUGH AT YOUR MISTAKES BUT LEARN FROM THEM JOKE OVER YOUR TROUBLES BUT GATHER STRENGTH FROM THEM
THAT OF THE BREATHLESS MOMENT WHEN THE STATELY PRESIDENT OF REDMOND GAVE HER CAP AND DIPLOMA AND HAILED HER B A IT WAS NOT OF THE FLASH IN GILBERT'S EYES WHEN HE SAW HER LILIES NOR THE PUZZLED PAINED GLANCE ROY GAVE HER AS HE PASSED HER ON THE PLATFORM
A WARM PLUMMY ODOR FILLED THE WHOLE HOUSE FOR PRISCILLA WAS COOKING IN THE KITCHEN PRESENTLY SHE CAME IN ENSHROUDED IN A HUGE WORK APRON WITH A SMUDGE OF FLOUR ON HER NOSE
YOU ARE SIXTEEN VERY NAUGHTY CHILDREN EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN AND FOR PUNISHMENT YOU MUST EAT YOUR BROTH WITHOUT ANY BREAD AND AFTERWARDS EACH ONE SHALL HAVE A SOUND WHIPPING AND BE SENT TO BED THEN ALL THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO CRY AT ONCE
INFANTRY A DEFENDER OF THE PEACE INHABITANT A NATIVE OF ANY VILLAGE TOWN OR CITY OLDEST INHABITANT THE CHAMPION LIAR INTUITION

WELL KNIT NEW JERSEY WELL BIT SEE MOSQUITO
STELLA OBTAINED A GOOD ALL ROUND SHOWING THEN CAME CONVOCATION THIS IS WHAT I WOULD ONCE HAVE CALLED AN EPOCH IN MY LIFE SAID ANNE AS SHE TOOK ROY'S VIOLETS OUT OF THEIR BOX AND GAZED AT THEM THOUGHTFULLY SHE MEANT TO CARRY THEM OF COURSE
THEN A FLIGHT OF ARROWS CAME FROM THE BUSHES AND ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BLUNT AND COULD DO HIM NO HARM THEY RATTLED ALL OVER HIS BODY AND ONE HIT HIS NOSE AND ANOTHER HIS CHIN WHILE SEVERAL STUCK FAST IN THE LOAVES OF BREAD ALTOGETHER THE BAKER MAN WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
HOW THANKFUL LITTLE PHIL WILL BE WHEN ALL THIS EXAMINATING IS OVER EXAMINATING I NEVER HEARD SUCH A WORD WELL HAVEN'T I AS GOOD A RIGHT TO MAKE A WORD AS ANY ONE ELSE DEMANDED PHIL WORDS AREN'T MADE THEY GROW
THE ARTS GRADUATES GAVE A GRADUATION DANCE THAT NIGHT WHEN ANNE DRESSED FOR IT SHE TOSSED ASIDE THE PEARL BEADS SHE USUALLY WORE AND TOOK FROM HER TRUNK THE SMALL BOX THAT HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES ON CHRISTMAS DAY IN IT WAS A THREAD LIKE GOLD CHAIN
WILDLY PLUNGED THE CHOCOLATE CAKE UNDER A CUSHION ON THE INGLENOOK SOFA AND DASHED UPSTAIRS STELLA BEGAN FEVERISHLY GATHERING UP HER MANUSCRIPT ONLY AUNT JAMESINA AND PHIL REMAINED NORMAL THANKS TO THEM EVERYBODY WAS SOON SITTING AT EASE EVEN ANNE
THERE ARE SO MANY CHILDREN SHE SAID ONE DAY TO THE BAKER MAN THAT I OFTEN REALLY DO N'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
I SPENT IT USEFULLY FOR CLOTHES AND HATED THEM EVERY TIME I PUT THEM ON THINK OF HAVING A REAL LIVE AUTHOR AT PATTY'S PLACE SAID PRISCILLA
MEANING MONEY AN INVENTION FOR BURNING MONEY INCOME THE RELIABLE OFFSPRING OF A WISE INVESTMENT FROM LAT IN
GILBERT HAD CALLED HER CARROTS AND VAINLY TRIED TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH A PINK CANDY HEART HAD WRITTEN HIM A NICE LITTLE NOTE OF THANKS BUT SHE HAD NEVER WORN THE TRINKET TONIGHT SHE FASTENED IT ABOUT HER WHITE THROAT WITH A DREAMY SMILE SHE AND PHIL WALKED TO REDMOND TOGETHER
THIS CAKE IS NOW WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A FLAT FAILURE AND THE CUSHION IS LIKEWISE RUINED NEVER TELL ME THAT FRIDAY ISN'T UNLUCKY PEOPLE WHO SEND WORD THEY ARE COMING ON SATURDAY SHOULDN'T COME ON FRIDAY SAID AUNT JAMESINA
PRISCILLA CAME DOWN APRONLESS AND SMUDGELESS STELLA REDUCED HER CORNER TO DECENCY AND PHIL SAVED THE SITUATION BY A STREAM OF READY SMALL TALK MISSUS GARDNER WAS TALL AND THIN AND HANDSOME EXQUISITELY GOWNED CORDIAL WITH A CORDIALITY THAT SEEMED
OR FALLING DOWN AND HURTING THEMSELVES AND THESE HAD TO BE COMFORTED AND SOME WERE NAUGHTY AND HAD TO BE WHIPPED AND SOME WERE DIRTY AND HAD TO BE WASHED AND SOME WERE GOOD AND HAD TO BE KISSED IT WAS GRAN'MA DO THIS AND GRAN'MA DO THAT FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
SOME OF THE CHILDREN HEARD HIM SAY THIS AND THEY RESOLVED TO PLAY HIM A TRICK IN RETURN FOR HIS ILL NATURED SPEECH THE BAKER MAN CAME EVERY DAY TO THE SHOE HOUSE AND BROUGHT TWO GREAT BASKETS OF BREAD
FROM THE BUTCHER OR A LOW QUARTER IN TOWN IN EITHER CASE THE LOWER THE TOUGHER JOKE A FORM OF HUMOR ENJOYED BY SOME AND MISUNDERSTOOD BY MOST IN ENGLAND REQUIRING A DIAGRAM
RAISED LETTERS AND A CLUB JOLLY VERSUS
FROM JOG TO MOVE SLOWLY AND KEY SOMETHING THAT MAKES FAST HENCE ONE WHO MAKES THE PACE FAST OR SLOW ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS JOINT EITHER A LOW LIMB
THEY TOOK CARE NOT TO PLAY ANY MORE TRICKS ON THE BAKER MAN AND AS THEY GREW OLDER THEY WERE NATURALLY MUCH BETTER BEHAVED BEFORE MANY YEARS THE BOYS WERE OLD ENOUGH TO WORK FOR THE NEIGHBORING FARMERS AND THAT MADE THE WOMAN'S FAMILY A GOOD DEAL SMALLER
OF TOLERANT WONDER ANNE DESPITE HER AFFECTION FOR RUSTY WAS NOT ESPECIALLY FOND OF CATS BUT MISSUS GARDNER'S TONE ANNOYED HER INCONSEQUENTLY SHE REMEMBERED THAT MISSUS JOHN BLYTHE WAS SO FOND OF CATS THAT SHE KEPT AS MANY AS HER HUSBAND WOULD ALLOW
BUT WOULD DO HER HAIR LOW FRIDAY AFTERNOON NONE OF THE GIRLS HAD CLASSES AT REDMOND STELLA TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE A PAPER FOR THE PHILOMATHIC SOCIETY AND WAS SITTING AT THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF THE LIVING ROOM
IT SEEMS JUST YESTERDAY THAT PRIS AND I WERE ALONE IN THAT CROWD OF FRESHMEN AT REDMOND AND NOW WE ARE SENIORS IN OUR FINAL EXAMINATIONS POTENT WISE AND REVEREND SENIORS QUOTED PHIL DO YOU SUPPOSE WE REALLY ARE ANY WISER THAN WHEN WE CAME TO REDMOND

ASKED THE GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS SITTING UPON HER DOORSTEPS ENGAGED IN MENDING SIXTEEN PAIRS OF STOCKINGS AT YOUR HOUSE THE STRANGER REPLIED IT LOOKS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A BIG SHOE A SHOE SHE SAID IN SURPRISE WHY YES
AND AS SHE PUT THE NIGHTDRESS ON EACH ONE SHE GAVE IT A SOUND WHIPPING AND SENT IT TO BED THEY CRIED SOME OF COURSE BUT THEY KNEW VERY WELL THEY DESERVED THE PUNISHMENT AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE ALL OF THEM WERE SOUND ASLEEP
A DISTRESSING STOMACH TROUBLE THAT IS SOMETIMES TEMPORARILY RELIEVED BY KICKING THE CAT OR WHIPPING THE CHILDREN INDIVIDUALITY A HARMLESS TRAIT POSSESSED BY ONE'S SELF
THE CHILDREN ALL PAINTED THEIR FACES TO LOOK AS INDIANS DO WHEN THEY ARE ON THE WARPATH AND THEY CAUGHT THE ROOSTERS AND THE TURKEY COCK AND PULLED FEATHERS FROM THEIR TAILS TO STICK IN THEIR HAIR AND THEN THE BOYS MADE WOODEN TOMAHAWKS FOR THE GIRLS AND BOWS AND ARROWS FOR THEIR OWN USE
OF COURSE IT WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE NINE SMALL CHILDREN THAN FIVE AND THEY OFTEN LED EACH OTHER INTO MISCHIEF SO THAT THE FLOWER BEDS BEGAN TO BE TRAMPLED UPON AND THE GREEN GRASS TO BE WORN UNDER THE CONSTANT TREAD OF LITTLE FEET
BUT IT WAS A GOOD AND WHOLESOME DIET AND THE CHILDREN THRIVED AND GREW FAT UPON IT ONE DAY A STRANGER CAME ALONG THE ROAD AND WHEN HE SAW THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE HE BEGAN TO LAUGH WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT SIR

SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN A WOMAN OF MARK SAID PORTHOS WITH HIS LOUD LAUGH
SEVEN THOUSAND LIVRES CRIED PORTHOS THAT POOR LITTLE DIAMOND WAS WORTH SEVEN THOUSAND LIVRES
A FAMILY AFFAIR WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THE CARDINAL A FAMILY AFFAIR CONCERNED NOBODY PEOPLE MIGHT EMPLOY THEMSELVES IN A FAMILY AFFAIR BEFORE ALL THE WORLD
IN THE NEXT FORTY FIVE YEARS IN WHICH THE ILLUSTRIOUS MARINER HAD SOME SHARE IN TWENTY SEVEN OF THEM HE APPEARED AS A GODFATHER WHAT VOYAGES CARTIER ACTUALLY MADE BEFORE HE SUDDENLY APPEARS IN HISTORY AS A PILOT OF THE KING OF FRANCE
THE FOUR FRIENDS DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE TWO ABSENCES HAD AS MAY WELL BE SUPPOSED THE EYE ON THE WATCH THE NOSE TO THE WIND AND THE EAR ON THE HARK
IN THE MORNING AS HE WAS MOUNTING HIS HORSE D'ARTAGNAN WHO FELT AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART A PARTIALITY FOR THE DUKE TOOK PLANCHET ASIDE
IF YOUR ARRANGEMENTS AT TOURS ARE YOUR ARRANGEMENTS ARAMIS THOSE OF LONDON ARE MINE I REQUEST THEN THAT PLANCHET MAY BE CHOSEN MORE PARTICULARLY AS HE HAS ALREADY BEEN TO LONDON WITH ME AND KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK CORRECTLY
A KIND OF MILLET AS BIG AS PEASON
AND SOUGHT SHELTER UPON THE SEA GIRT PROMONTORY WHICH HAS SINCE BORNE THE NAME OF AARON'S ROCK AARON FOUNDED A SETTLEMENT TO THE SAME PLACE CAME ABOUT TWENTY YEARS LATER
CONFIDING IN THE ADDRESS OF BAZIN MADE A POMPOUS EULOGIUM ON HIS CANDIDATE FINALLY D'ARTAGNAN HAD ENTIRE FAITH IN THE BRAVERY OF PLANCHET AND REMINDED THEM OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD CONDUCTED HIMSELF
A BISHOP OF CASTLE GWENT WITH A SMALL BAND OF FOLLOWERS THE LEADER OF THIS FLOCK WAS KNOWN AS SAINT MALO AND HE GAVE HIS NAME TO THE SEAPORT
THAT WILL REDUCE THE SUM TO FIVE THOUSAND LIVRES
AND THE PROTEGE OF THE HIGH ADMIRAL OF FRANCE WE DO NOT KNOW THIS POSITION IN ITSELF AND THE FACT THAT AT THE TIME OF HIS MARRIAGE IN FIFTEEN NINETEEN HE HAD ALREADY THE RANK OF MASTER PILOT
D'ARTAGNAN PASSED THE DAY IN EXHIBITING HIS MUSKETEER'S UNIFORM IN EVERY STREET OF THE CAMP IN THE EVENING AT THE APPOINTED HOUR THE FOUR FRIENDS MET THERE ONLY REMAINED THREE THINGS TO DECIDE
AND IN LOOKING OUT FOR ALL THE COURIERS WHO ARRIVED MORE THAN ONCE AN INVOLUNTARY TREMBLING SEIZED THEM WHEN CALLED UPON FOR SOME UNEXPECTED SERVICE THEY HAD BESIDES TO LOOK CONSTANTLY TO THEIR OWN PROPER SAFETY
SAINT MALO BECAME FAMOUS AS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CORSAIRS OF THE NORTHERN COAST THESE HAD SUCCEEDED THE VIKINGS OF AN EARLIER DAY AND THEY SHOWED A HARDIHOOD AND A RECKLESS DARING EQUAL TO THAT OF THEIR PREDECESSORS LATER ON
WOULD SHOW THAT HE HAD MADE THE ATLANTIC VOYAGE THERE IS SOME FAINT EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD EVEN BEEN TO BRAZIL
IF SHE IS AS GREAT A LADY AS HER WRITING IS LARGE YOU ARE A LUCKY FELLOW GOMRADE
D'ARTAGNAN ALREADY WORE HIS UNIFORM FOR BEING NEARLY OF THE SAME SIZE AS ARAMIS AND AS ARAMIS WAS SO LIBERALLY PAID BY THE PUBLISHER WHO PURCHASED HIS POEM AS TO ALLOW HIM TO BUY EVERYTHING DOUBLE HE SOLD HIS FRIEND A COMPLETE OUTFIT
WERE SENDING FORTH ADVENTUROUS FISHERMEN TO PLY THEIR TRADE AMONG THE FOGS OF THE GREAT BANKS OF THE NEW LAND THE BRETON BOY WHOM WE MAY IMAGINE WANDERING ABOUT THE CROWDED WHARVES OF THE LITTLE HARBOUR
WELL MY DEAR FRIEND ADD TO HIS NATURAL DEVOTEDNESS A GOOD SUM OF MONEY AND THEN INSTEAD OF ANSWERING FOR HIM ONCE ANSWER FOR HIM TWICE
I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT OUR FRIEND D'ARTAGNAN HAS ADDED ANY OF HIS OWN TO THE AMOUNT BUT GENTLEMEN IN ALL THIS SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE DO NOT THINK OF THE QUEEN LET US TAKE SOME HEED OF THE WELFARE OF HER DEAR BUCKINGHAM THAT IS THE LEAST WE OWE HER
ARAMIS MUMBLED VERSES TO HIMSELF AND PORTHOS FROM TIME TO TIME PULLED A HAIR OR TWO FROM HIS MUSTACHE IN SIGN OF DESPAIR BUT ALL AT ONCE A SHADOW APPEARED IN THE DARKNESS THE OUTLINE OF WHICH WAS FAMILIAR TO D'ARTAGNAN AND A WELL KNOWN VOICE SAID
WHO WAS AN OPTIMIST WHEN THINGS WERE CONCERNED AND A PESSIMIST WHEN MEN WERE IN QUESTION THEY WILL PROMISE EVERYTHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE MONEY AND ON THE ROAD FEAR WILL PREVENT THEM FROM ACTING ONCE TAKEN THEY WILL BE PRESSED WHEN PRESSED THEY WILL CONFESS EVERYTHING
NOT AT ALL CRIED D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS ANXIOUS THE MATTER SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED ON THE CONTRARY I THINK IT VERY EASY IT WOULD BE NO DOUBT PARBLEU IF WE WRITE TO LORD DE WINTER ABOUT AFFAIRS OF VAST IMPORTANCE OF THE HORRORS OF THE CARDINAL
MY LORD DO YOU REMEMBER THE LITTLE GOAT PASTURE OF THE LUXEMBOURG GOOD THE LUXEMBOURG ONE MIGHT BELIEVE THIS IS AN ALLUSION TO THE QUEEN MOTHER
HERE FOR CENTURIES HAS DWELT A RACE OF ADVENTUROUS FISHERMEN AND NAVIGATORS WHOSE DARING IS UNSURPASSED BY ANY OTHER SEAFARING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE HISTORY
AND THAT THIS ADVENTURE WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY THE SAILING OF OTHER NORMAN SHIPS FOR THE SAME GOAL WE HAVE HOWEVER NO RECORD OF CARTIER AND HIS ACTUAL DOINGS UNTIL WE FIND HIS NAME IN AN ENTRY ON THE BAPTISMAL REGISTER OF SAINT MALO
AND IT IS A RATHER DIFFICULT MATTER THE CHANCELLOR HIMSELF WOULD BE PUZZLED HOW TO WRITE SUCH A LETTER AND YET THE CHANCELLOR DRAWS UP AN OFFICIAL REPORT VERY READILY NEVER MIND BE SILENT I WILL WRITE
FAMILY AFFAIR ARAMIS HAD DISCOVERED THE IDEA THE LACKEYS PORTHOS HAD DISCOVERED THE MEANS THE DIAMOND D'ARTAGNAN ALONE HAD DISCOVERED NOTHING HE ORDINARILY THE MOST INVENTIVE OF THE FOUR
HE THINKS IT HIS DUTY TO RESPOND TO THAT FRIENDSHIP BY SENDING YOU IMPORTANT INFORMATION TWICE YOU HAVE NEARLY BEEN THE VICTIM OF A NEAR RELATIVE WHOM YOU BELIEVE TO BE YOUR HEIR BECAUSE YOU ARE IGNORANT THAT BEFORE SHE CONTRACTED A MARRIAGE IN ENGLAND SHE WAS ALREADY MARRIED IN FRANCE
THE HEAD IS SLIGHTLY BOWED WITH THE WEIGHT OF YEARS AND THE FACE IS WANTING IN THAT SUGGESTION OF UNCONQUERABLE WILL WHICH IS THE DOMINATING FEATURE OF THE PORTRAIT OF SAINT MALO
MY DEAR ARAMIS YOU HAVE THE PEN OF A SECRETARY OF STATE LORD DE WINTER WILL NOW BE UPON HIS GUARD IF THE LETTER SHOULD REACH HIM AND EVEN IF IT SHOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE CARDINAL WE SHALL NOT BE COMPROMISED
DID NOT ALLOW THEM TO SLEEP VERY QUIETLY
YOU SHALL SEE IF CONFIDENCE CAN BE PLACED IN ME MOUNTED ON AN EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS TO LEAVE AT THE END OF TWENTY LEAGUES IN ORDER TO TAKE THE POST
THE PERSON WHO WRITES THESE FEW LINES HAD THE HONOR OF CROSSING SWORDS WITH YOU IN THE LITTLE ENCLOSURE
NEFFER NEFFER
IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE CONTENT WITH THE PICTURE WHICH HANGS IN THE TOWN HALL OF THE SEAPORT OF SAINT MALO IF IT DOES NOT SHOW US CARTIER AS HE WAS AND WE HAVE NO ABSOLUTE PROOF IN THE ONE OR THE OTHER DIRECTION
AND SMILING ACCORDING TO CUSTOM ENTERED THE CABARET OF THE PARPAILLOT AS THE FOUR FRIENDS WERE SITTING DOWN TO BREAKFAST SAYING AS HAD BEEN AGREED UPON
AND DOES THE HUSBAND OF THIS FRIGHTFUL CREATURE STILL LIVE SAID ARAMIS HE STILL LIVES ARE YOU QUITE SURE OF IT I AM HE
HAS PICTURED UPON IT A GROUP OF FIGURES THAT REPRESENT THE LANDING OF THE NAVIGATOR AND HIS FOLLOWERS AMONG THE INDIANS OF GASPE IT WAS THE FASHION OF THE TIME TO ATTEMPT BY SUCH DECORATIONS TO MAKE MAPS VIVID
HE CREDITED THIS WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO HIM THE EQUAL OF A DEMON WITH AGENTS AS SUPERNATURAL AS HERSELF AT THE LEAST NOISE HE IMAGINED HIMSELF ABOUT TO BE ARRESTED AND THAT PLANCHET WAS BEING BROUGHT BACK TO BE CONFRONTED WITH HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS
AND IN THOSE DAYS THIS WOULD SCARCELY HAVE OCCURRED TO A WRITER WHO HAD NOT SEEN BOTH PLANTS OF WHICH HE SPOKE THERE GROWETH LIKEWISE SO RUNS THE QUAINT TRANSLATION THAT APPEARS IN HAKLUYT'S VOYAGES
BUT THE THIRD TIME WHICH IS THE PRESENT YOU MAY SUCCUMB YOUR RELATIVE LEFT LA ROCHELLE FOR ENGLAND DURING THE NIGHT WATCH HER ARRIVAL FOR SHE HAS GREAT AND TERRIBLE PROJECTS IF YOU REQUIRE TO KNOW POSITIVELY WHAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF
AND OPENED THE SO ANXIOUSLY EXPECTED LETTER IT CONTAINED HALF A LINE IN A HAND PERFECTLY BRITISH AND WITH A CONCISENESS AS PERFECTLY SPARTAN THANK YOU BE EASY D'ARTAGNAN TRANSLATED THIS FOR THE OTHERS
AND HE RESTRAINED HIMSELF I HAVE THE NOTE
BUT REMEMBER ALSO THAT IF BY YOUR FAULT ANY EVIL HAPPENS TO D'ARTAGNAN I WILL FIND YOU WHEREVER YOU MAY BE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RIPPING UP YOUR BELLY
THE SON OF HIS SISTER JEHANNE STRANGELY ENOUGH THIS PROVED TO BE ONLY THE FIRST OF A GREAT MANY SACRED CEREMONIES OF THIS SORT IN WHICH HE TOOK PART THERE IS A RECORD OF MORE THAN FIFTY BAPTISMS AT SAINT MALO
AND PLACES CONFIDENCE IN NOBODY BUT HIM ANY OTHER PERSON WOULD FAIL BESIDES BAZIN IS AMBITIOUS AND LEARNED BAZIN HAS READ HISTORY GENTLEMEN HE KNOWS THAT SIXTUS THE FIFTH BECAME POPE AFTER HAVING KEPT PIGS
TO LET A WOMAN TERRIFY YOU SO AND WHAT DOES IT AMOUNT TO AFTER ALL TO BE IMPRISONED WELL BUT WE SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF PRISON MADAME BONACIEUX WAS RELEASED
THE SITUATION OF THE PORT HAS MADE IT A NURSERY OF HARDY SEAMEN THE TOWN STANDS UPON A LITTLE PROMONTORY THAT JUTS OUT AS A PENINSULA INTO THE OCEAN THE TIDE POURS IN AND OUT OF THE HARBOUR THUS FORMED
ADORNED HIS HEAD WITH A CARDINAL'S HAT BUT AS WE HAVE SAID BAZIN HAD NOT BY HIS FORTUNATE RETURN REMOVED MORE THAN A PART OF THE UNEASINESS WHICH WEIGHED UPON THE FOUR FRIENDS THE DAYS OF EXPECTATION ARE LONG
OUT OF THIS BACKGROUND THEN OF UNCERTAINTY AND CONJECTURE EMERGES IN FIFTEEN THIRTY FOUR JACQUES CARTIER A
AS IT MUST HAVE BEEN MADE LONG BEFORE THE SAINT MALO PORTRAIT WAS PAINTED THE RESEMBLANCE OF THE TWO FACES PERHAPS INDICATES THE EXISTENCE OF SOME DEFINITE AND GENUINE PORTRAIT OF JACQUES CARTIER OF WHICH THE RECORD HAS BEEN LOST
FOR WE KNOW NOTHING OF THE ORIGIN OF THE PORTRAIT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AN ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY OF RECENT YEARS SEEMS TO CONFIRM IN SOME DEGREE THE GENUINENESS OF THE SAINT MALO PORTRAIT
LET US GIVE HIM ONLY HALF THE SUM PROMISED HIM WITH THE LETTER WITH AN AGREEMENT THAT HE SHALL HAVE THE OTHER HALF IN EXCHANGE FOR THE REPLY
BUT SHE COULD NOT MARRY YOUR BROTHER BEING ALREADY MARRIED IN FRANCE AND HAVING BEEN
QUIETLY DRAWING FOUR PISTOLES FROM HIS POCKET AND THROWING THEM UPON THE TABLE COME GENTLEMEN SAID HE THEY ARE BEATING THE TATTOO LET US TO BED AND ATHOS WENT OUT OF THE PARPAILLOT FOLLOWED BY D'ARTAGNAN ARAMIS CAME BEHIND GIVING HIS ARM TO PORTHOS
NOW SWORN TO THE SERVICE OF HIS MOST CHRISTIAN MAJESTY
THEN MONSIEUR SAID PLANCHET YOU MUST BUY ME A WATCH
THAT'S ALL VERY WELL REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN BUT I AM TIRED OF FEARING WHEN I OPEN A FRESH BOTTLE THAT THE WINE MAY COME FROM THE CELLAR OF MILADY
DOUBTLESS SAID ARAMIS FOR WE NOT ONLY REQUIRE TO BE WELL SERVED IN ORDER TO SUCCEED BUT MOREOVER NOT TO FAIL FOR IN CASE OF FAILURE HEADS ARE IN QUESTION NOT FOR OUR LACKEYS
IN FANCY AT LEAST SUPPOSE THAT THIS FORLORN LITTLE SAVAGE WITH THE REGAL TITLE WAS A LITTLE GIRL WHOM THE NAVIGATOR AFTER THE FASHION OF HIS DAY HAD BROUGHT HOME AS LIVING EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE STRANGE LANDS THAT HE HAD SEEN
THESE GENTLEMEN ONLY SAY THIS OUT OF AFFECTION FOR ME BUT AT BOTTOM THEY ALL LIKE YOU AH MONSIEUR SAID PLANCHET I WILL SUCCEED OR I WILL CONSENT TO BE CUT IN QUARTERS AND IF THEY DO CUT ME IN QUARTERS BE ASSURED THAT NOT A MORSEL OF ME WILL SPEAK
IT WAS ONLY THIS I HAD A DREAM AND I RELATED IT TO HER YEZ YEZ SAID THE SWISS IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH TO DELL A DREAM BUT I NEFFER DREAM
THEN THE GLORY AND THEN THE DANGER
ITS OWNER DECIDED TO TEAR IT DOWN AND IN DOING SO HE STUMBLED UPON A STARTLING DISCOVERY HE FOUND A DUMMY WINDOW THAT GENERATIONS BEFORE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN BUILT OVER AND CONCEALED
HE STOOD AS GODFATHER TO HIS NEPHEW
YOU SPEAK LIKE THE APOCALYPSE AND YOU ARE AS TRUE AS THE GOSPEL THERE IS NOTHING NOW TO DO BUT TO PUT THE ADDRESS TO THIS LETTER THAT IS EASILY DONE SAID ARAMIS HE FOLDED THE LETTER FANCIFULLY AND TOOK UP HIS PEN AND WROTE
AND ME TOO SAID D'ARTAGNAN AND ME TOO SAID PORTHOS AND ME TOO SAID ARAMIS
HIS CHIN SUPPORTED BY HIS HAND WHILE HIS EYES GAZE OUTWARD UPON THE WESTERN OCEAN AS IF SEEKING TO PENETRATE ITS MYSTERIES THE FACE IS FIRM AND STRONG WITH TIGHT SET JAW PROMINENT BROW
THIS IS THE PICTURE THAT APPEARS IN THE FORM OF A MEDALLION OR RING SHAPED ILLUSTRATION IN MORE THAN ONE OF THE MODERN WORKS UPON THE GREAT ADVENTURER BUT HERE AGAIN WE HAVE NO PROOFS OF IDENTITY
REPUDIATED BY HER HUSBAND SAID ATHOS BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN BRANDED CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN BAH CRIED PORTHOS IMPOSSIBLE WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT SHE WANTED TO HAVE HER BROTHER IN LAW KILLED YES
WE WILL NOT VENTURE TO SAY WHETHER IT WAS FROM TERROR CREATED BY THE THREATS OR FROM TENDERNESS AT SEEING FOUR FRIENDS SO CLOSELY UNITED D'ARTAGNAN TOOK HIS HAND
IN A BAPTISMAL REGISTER OF SAINT MALO IS RECORDED THE CHRISTENING IN FIFTEEN TWENTY EIGHT OF A CERTAIN CATHERINE OF BREZIL TO WHOM CARTIER'S WIFE STOOD GODMOTHER WE MAY
DEMONS DEITIES MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURES AND NAKED SAVAGES DISPORTED THEMSELVES ALONG THE BORDERS OF THE MAPS AND HELPED TO DECORATE UNEXPLORED SPACES OF EARTH AND OCEAN
HERE AGAIN ARE THE TUFTED HAT THE BEARDED FACE AND THE FEATURES OF THE PICTURE OF SAINT MALO ON THE BACK OF THE WOOD THE DEEPLY GRAVEN INITIALS J C SEEMED TO PROVE
ON HIS HEAD IS THE TUFTED BRETON CAP FAMILIAR IN THE PICTURES OF THE DAYS OF THE GREAT NAVIGATORS AT THE WAIST ON THE LEFT SIDE HANGS A SWORD AND ON THE RIGHT CLOSE TO THE BELT THE DIRK OR PONIARD OF THE PERIOD
AND DID NOT LET GO TILL IT WAS REDUCED TO A CINDER THEN CALLING PLANCHET HE SAID NOW MY LAD YOU MAY CLAIM YOUR SEVEN HUNDRED LIVRES
HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO MY WAYS AND I AM PARTICULAR YESTERDAY'S AFFAIR MUST HAVE SHAKEN HIM A LITTLE HIS VOYAGE WOULD UPSET HIM QUITE PLANCHET WAS SENT FOR AND INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN HIM THE MATTER HAD BEEN NAMED TO HIM BY D'ARTAGNAN WHO IN THE FIRST PLACE POINTED OUT THE MONEY TO HIM
MIGHT FIND BEHIND THE COASTS AND ISLANDS NOW REVEALED TO EUROPE IN THE WESTERN SEA THE HALF FABLED EMPIRES OF CIPANGO AND CATHAY
LIKE UNTO THAT WHICH GROWETH IN BRESIL AND LATER ON IN THE ACCOUNT OF HIS SECOND VOYAGE HE REPEATS THE REFERENCE TO BRAZIL THEN GOODLY AND LARGE FIELDS
READ HER PAST HISTORY ON HER LEFT SHOULDER
AND AS IF HE BREATHED HIS CUSTOMARY ATMOSPHERE ON THE SIXTEENTH DAY IN PARTICULAR THESE SIGNS WERE SO STRONG IN D'ARTAGNAN AND HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT THEY COULD NOT REMAIN QUIET IN ONE PLACE AND WANDERED ABOUT LIKE GHOSTS ON THE ROAD BY WHICH PLANCHET WAS EXPECTED
A BENEFIT REPROACHED IS AN OFFENSE COMMITTED THE DEVIL SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU ARE INSUPPORTABLE IF THE LETTER MUST BE WRITTEN UNDER YOUR CENSURE MY FAITH I RENOUNCE THE TASK AND YOU WILL DO RIGHT HANDLE THE MUSKET AND THE SWORD MY DEAR FELLOW
PLANCHET IS BRAVE AND SHREWD THEY ARE TWO QUALITIES OUT OF THE FOUR GENTLEMEN SAID ARAMIS THE PRINCIPAL QUESTION IS NOT TO KNOW WHICH OF OUR FOUR LACKEYS IS THE MOST DISCREET THE MOST STRONG THE MOST CLEVER OR THE MOST BRAVE
NEFFER
MY COUSIN MY SISTER AND I ARE SKILLFUL IN INTERPRETING DREAMS AND EVEN ENTERTAIN GREAT FEAR OF THEM BUT OF YOURS IT MAY BE SAID I HOPE EVERY DREAM IS AN ILLUSION ADIEU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
MASTER PILOT OF THE PORT OF SAINCTE MALO
IN THE TICKLISH AFFAIR OF BOULOGNE THESE FOUR VIRTUES DISPUTED THE PRIZE FOR A LENGTH OF TIME AND GAVE BIRTH TO MAGNIFICENT SPEECHES WHICH WE DO NOT REPEAT HERE FOR FEAR THEY SHOULD BE DEEMED TOO LONG
WITH PRECISELY THE FACE AND BEARING WHICH THE HERO WORSHIPPER WOULD READ INTO THE CHARACTER OF SUCH A DISCOVERER THE PORT OF SAINT MALO THE BIRTHPLACE AND THE HOME OF CARTIER IS SITUATED IN THE OLD PROVINCE OF BRITTANY
UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF MONSIEUR ABBE HERE FOR EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS OR COMMON WANTS WILL THAT DO
WHO APPEARS TO ME TO BE A VERY GOOD LAD BUT IF HE DOES NOT COME SAID D'ARTAGNAN WELL IF HE DOES NOT COME IT WILL BE BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN DELAYED THAT'S ALL HE MAY HAVE FALLEN FROM HIS HORSE HE MAY HAVE CUT A CAPER FROM THE DECK
WELL REPLIED THE LATTER BLUSHING WHAT MUST I SAY
WELL CRIED D'ARTAGNAN TELL US ALL ABOUT IT
HIS EMINENCE IS THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS POLITICIAN OF TIMES PAST OF TIMES PRESENT AND PROBABLY OF TIMES TO COME HE WOULD EXTINGUISH THE SUN IF THE SUN INCOMMODED HIM GIVE THESE HAPPY TIDINGS TO YOUR SISTER MY DEAR COUSIN
AND ROSE IN HIS TURN WITH A NERVOUS MOVEMENT HE COULD NOT REPRESS THE DAY HOWEVER PASSED AWAY AND THE EVENING CAME ON SLOWLY BUT FINALLY IT CAME THE BARS WERE FILLED WITH DRINKERS
WITHIN A FEW YEARS AFTER THE GREAT DISCOVERY OF COLUMBUS
WHAT THEY SHOULD WRITE TO MILADY'S BROTHER WHAT THEY SHOULD WRITE TO THE CLEVER PERSON AT TOURS AND WHICH SHOULD BE THE LACKEYS TO CARRY THE LETTERS EVERYONE OFFERED HIS OWN
ARAMIS ACCORDINGLY TOOK THE QUILL REFLECTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS WROTE EIGHT OR TEN LINES IN A CHARMING LITTLE FEMALE HAND AND THEN WITH A VOICE SOFT AND SLOW AS IF EACH WORD HAD BEEN SCRUPULOUSLY WEIGHED HE READ THE FOLLOWING MY LORD
THE PRINCIPAL THING IS TO KNOW WHICH LOVES MONEY THE BEST WHAT ARAMIS SAYS IS VERY SENSIBLE REPLIED ATHOS WE MUST SPECULATE UPON THE FAULTS OF PEOPLE AND NOT UPON THEIR VIRTUES MONSIEUR ABBE YOU ARE A GREAT MORALIST
THAT THE IMAGE WHICH HAD LAIN HIDDEN FOR GENERATIONS BEHIND THE WOODWORK OF THE OLD CANADIAN HOUSE IS INDEED THAT OF THE GREAT DISCOVERER BESIDE THE INITIALS IS CARVED THE DATE SEVENTEEN O FOUR
AND ACT SO THAT WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME HEAR YOU SPOKEN OF MARIE MICHON AND WHAT DREAM DOES SHE MEAN ASKED THE DRAGOON WHO HAD APPROACHED DURING THE READING YEZ WHAT'S THE DREAM SAID THE SWISS
APPEAR ON THE REGISTERS OF SAINT MALO SAINT BRIAC AND OTHER PLACES IN SOME PROFUSION DURING THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES THE FAMILY SEEMS TO HAVE DIED OUT ALTHOUGH NOT MANY YEARS AGO
UNFORTUNATELY SAID ATHOS HE WHOM WE SEND MUST POSSESS IN HIMSELF ALONE THE FOUR QUALITIES UNITED
YOU WILL FURTHER SAY TO HIM WATCH OVER HIS GRACE LORD BUCKINGHAM FOR THEY WISH TO ASSASSINATE HIM BUT THIS PLANCHET IS SO SERIOUS AND IMPORTANT THAT I HAVE NOT INFORMED MY FRIENDS THAT I WOULD ENTRUST THIS SECRET TO YOU AND FOR A CAPTAIN'S COMMISSION I WOULD NOT WRITE IT
MADE A SIGN OF ASSENT TO D'ARTAGNAN WHO BY IT UNDERSTOOD HE WAS AT LIBERTY TO SPEAK WELL THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY SAID D'ARTAGNAN MY LORD YOUR SISTER IN LAW IS AN INFAMOUS WOMAN WHO WISHED TO HAVE YOU KILLED THAT SHE MIGHT INHERIT YOUR WEALTH
WHOSE NAME IS ASSOCIATED FOR ALL TIME WITH THE PROUD TITLE OF DISCOVERER OF CANADA THE PICTURE IS THAT OF A BEARDED MAN IN THE PRIME OF LIFE STANDING ON THE DECK OF A SHIP HIS BENT ELBOW RESTING UPON THE GUNWALE
AND BE A GOOD LAD REMEMBER IF YOU TALK IF YOU BABBLE IF YOU GET DRUNK YOU RISK YOUR MASTER'S HEAD WHO HAS SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN YOUR FIDELITY AND WHO ANSWERS FOR YOU
PORTHOS AND ARAMIS REMAINED BEHIND TO ENCOUNTER THE JOKES OF THE DRAGOON AND THE SWISS AS TO BAZIN HE WENT AND LAY DOWN ON A TRUSS OF STRAW AND AS HE HAD MORE IMAGINATION THAN THE SWISS HE DREAMED THAT ARAMIS HAVING BECOME POPE
A PARTNER WORTHY OF HIS COMPANY THEY WERE PLAYING TOGETHER AS USUAL WHEN SEVEN O'CLOCK SOUNDED THE PATROL WAS HEARD PASSING TO DOUBLE THE POSTS AT HALF PAST SEVEN THE RETREAT WAS SOUNDED WE ARE LOST SAID D'ARTAGNAN IN THE EAR OF ATHOS
AND OF THEIR FIVE CHILDREN THE SECOND ONE JACQUES ROSE TO GREATNESS AS THE DISCOVERER OF CANADA THERE IS LITTLE TO CHRONICLE
MILADY HAD HIM ONE DAY TURNED OUT OF DOORS WITH SUNDRY BLOWS OF A GOOD STICK TO ACCELERATE HIS MOTIONS NOW PLANCHET HAS AN EXCELLENT MEMORY AND I WILL BE BOUND THAT SOONER THAN RELINQUISH ANY POSSIBLE MEANS OF VENGEANCE HE WILL ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE BEATEN TO DEATH
LIFE IS A CHAPLET OF LITTLE MISERIES WHICH THE PHILOSOPHER COUNTS WITH A SMILE BE PHILOSOPHERS AS I AM GENTLEMEN SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND LET US DRINK
AND CONSTABLE OF THE TOWN AND CITY OF SAINT MALO CARTIER'S MARRIAGE WAS CHILDLESS SO THAT HE LEFT NO DIRECT DESCENDANTS BUT THE BRANCHES OF THE FAMILY DESCENDED FROM THE ORIGINAL JEAN CARTIER
MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN YOU WILL NEVER MAKE ANYTHING BUT A VERY BAD SECRETARY WHERE YOUR LIFE WAS SPARED FOR SHAME THAT'S UNWORTHY A MAN OF SPIRIT IS NOT TO BE REMINDED OF SUCH SERVICES
DIRECT DESCENDANTS OF PIERRE CARTIER THE UNCLE OF JACQUES WERE STILL SURVIVING IN FRANCE IT IS PERHAPS NO GREAT LOSS TO THE WORLD THAT WE HAVE SO LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANCESTORS AND RELATIVES OF THE FAMOUS MARINER IT IS HOWEVER
THIS JEAN CARTIER OR QUARTIER WHO WAS BORN IN SAINT MALO IN FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT TOOK TO WIFE IN FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN GUILLEMETTE BAUDOIN OF THE FOUR SONS THAT SHE BORE HIM
I HAVE DREAMED THAT THE UNLUCKY ENGLISHMAN WAS DEAD I CANNOT RECOLLECT WHETHER IT WAS BY STEEL OR BY POISON ONLY OF THIS I AM SURE I HAVE DREAMED HE WAS DEAD AND YOU KNOW MY DREAMS NEVER DECEIVE ME BE ASSURED THEN OF SEEING ME SOON RETURN
AND D'ARTAGNAN IN PARTICULAR WOULD HAVE WAGERED THAT THE DAYS WERE FORTY FOUR HOURS HE FORGOT THE NECESSARY SLOWNESS OF NAVIGATION HE EXAGGERATED TO HIMSELF THE POWER OF MILADY
HUMILIATED BY THE SUSPICION AND MOREOVER TERRIFIED AT THE CALM AIR OF THE MUSKETEER AND I SAID PORTHOS ROLLING HIS LARGE EYES REMEMBER I WILL SKIN YOU ALIVE AH MONSIEUR
SHE WAS MARRIED ASKED ARAMIS YES
D'ARTAGNAN AND I OR RATHER TO OBSERVE THE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER I AND D'ARTAGNAN
RAVAGED BY PERHAPS TWO CENTURIES OF WIND AND WEATHER THE OLD HOUSE AFFORDED BUT LITTLE SHELTER AGAINST THE BOISTEROUS GALES AND THE BITTER COLD OF THE RUDE CLIMATE OF THE GULF
IN THE TOWN HALL OF THE SEAPORT OF SAINT MALO THERE HANGS A PORTRAIT OF JACQUES CARTIER THE GREAT SEA CAPTAIN OF THAT PLACE
STILL FURTHER HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE WORTHY PICARD AT ONE TIME SO GREAT DIMINISHED DAY BY DAY
D'ARTAGNAN HAS GIVEN US AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM AND THE LETTER MUST BE WRITTEN AT ONCE THE DEVIL
HOW LIKE OR UNLIKE THE FEATURES OF CARTIER THIS PICTURE IN THE TOWN HALL MAY BE WE HAVE NO MEANS OF TELLING PAINTED PROBABLY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE IT HAS HUNG THERE FOR MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS
DEEPLY TO BE DEPLORED THAT BEYOND THE RECORD OF HIS VOYAGES WE KNOW SO LITTLE OF JACQUES CARTIER HIMSELF WE MAY TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT HE EARLY BECAME A SAILOR BROUGHT UP AT SUCH A TIME AND PLACE HE COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO DO SO
WITH TOMORROW ALWAYS THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW WHICH HE HAD PURSUED FOR THIRTY YEARS HE WAS SIXTY JUST A WEEK AGO THIS EVENING HE SAID AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO DOUBT IF HE WOULD REMAIN ON THE BEACH AT CORDOVA MUCH LONGER
WHEN THEY ONCE GET STARTED AN IT'S UP TO A FEW ALASKA JACKS AN TOUGH NUT BILLS TO GET THEIR FEET PLANTED FIRST ON THE OTHER SIDE WILL YOU GO ALAN SHOOK HIS HEAD SOME DAY BUT NOT NOW
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVEN MONTHS HIS MUSCLES RESPONDED TO THE SWING OF IT AND ERICKSEN OLD AS HIS YEARS IN THE WAY OF THE NORTH WHISTLED LOUDLY AND RUMBLED A BIT OF CRUDE SONG THROUGH HIS BEARD AS HE LIGHTED A FIRE
AND ARE RISING UP TO THE HIGHER GROUND OF THE COUNTRY OF THE PINES AND THE LAKES LOOK FROM THE WINDOW AS YOU GO THE CITY IS FAR BEHIND NOW
THE OLD FLASH WAS IN HIS EYES AND HE WAS SEEING THE FIGHT AHEAD OF HIM AGAIN THE FIGHT TO DO HIS BIT IN STRIKING THE SHACKLES OF MISGOVERNMENT FROM ALASKA AND ROUSING THE WORLD TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MENACE WHICH HUNG OVER HER
COULD NOT BE IMPROVISED IN THIS HURRIED THOUGH DISASTROUSLY SLOW PREPARATION FOR A WAR THE SHIP IN WHICH WOLFE WAS TO SAIL HAD BEEN LYING IDLE FOR YEARS AND HER PESTILENTIAL BILGE WATER SOON BEGAN TO MAKE THE SAILORS AND SOLDIERS SICKEN AND DIE
THAT NIGHT IN OLAF'S CABIN ALAN PUT HIMSELF BACK ON THE OLD TRACK AGAIN HE MADE NO EFFORT TO MINIMIZE THE TRAGEDY THAT HAD COME INTO HIS LIFE AND HE KNEW ITS EFFECT UPON HIM WOULD NEVER BE WIPED AWAY
AND AFTER THAT FOR AN HOUR OR MORE SOMETHING LIVED FOR HIM IN THE GLOW OF THE FIRE WHICH OLAF KEPT BURNING IT WAS THE MEMORY OF MARY STANDISH HER QUIET BEAUTIFUL EYES GAZING AT HIM HER PALE FACE
PAPA AND I ARE JUST GOING ON BOARD BUT I BELIEVE SHALL NOT SAIL THIS FORTNIGHT IN WHICH TIME IF I CAN GET ASHORE AT PORTSMOUTH OR ANY OTHER TOWN I WILL CERTAINLY WRITE TO YOU AND WHEN WE ARE GONE BY EVERY SHIP WE MEET BECAUSE I KNOW IT IS MY DUTY
WON'T LET THEM COME WITH COAL ENOUGH UNDER OUR FEET TO LAST A THOUSAND YEARS WE ARE BUYING FUEL FROM THE STATES WE'VE GOT BILLIONS IN COPPER AND OIL BUT CAN'T TOUCH THEM WE SHOULD HAVE SOME OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST MANUFACTURING PLANTS
IT LEAVES THE CITY EVERY DAY ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE TRAIN FOR MARIPOSA STRANGE THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW OF IT THOUGH YOU COME FROM THE LITTLE TOWN OR DID LONG YEARS AGO ODD THAT YOU NEVER KNEW IN ALL THESE YEARS
THAT MADE HIM FAMOUS ROUND THE WORLD NEWPORT ISLE OF WIGHT AUGUST SIXTH SEVENTEEN FORTY I RECEIVED MY DEAREST MAMMA'S LETTER ON MONDAY LAST BUT COULD NOT ANSWER IT THEN
ASK HIM IF HE EVER TASTED DUCK THAT COULD FOR A MOMENT BE COMPARED TO THE BLACK DUCKS IN THE RICE MARSH ALONG THE OSSAWIPPI AND AS FOR FISH AND FISHING
THAT CROWD OF SUBURBAN PEOPLE GOING HOME ON COMMUTATION TICKETS AND SOMETIMES STANDING THICK IN THE AISLES THOSE ARE OF COURSE NOT MARIPOSA PEOPLE BUT LOOK ROUND A LITTLE BIT AND YOU'LL FIND THEM EASILY ENOUGH
WITHIN A MONTH AN ARMY SUCH AS NO ONE HAD SEEN SINCE THE DAYS OF MARLBOROUGH HAD BEEN ASSEMBLED AT BLACKHEATH
AND SAT WATCHING OLAF AS HE MOTHERED THE HALF BAKED BANNOCK LOAF IT MADE HIM THINK OF HIS FATHER A THOUSAND TIMES THE TWO MUST HAVE CAMPED LIKE THIS IN THE DAYS WHEN ALASKA WAS NEW AND THERE WERE NO MAPS TO TELL THEM WHAT LAY BEYOND THE NEXT RANGE
THUNDERING AND POUNDING TOWARDS THE NORTH WITH HEMLOCK SPARKS POURING OUT INTO THE DARKNESS FROM THE FUNNEL OF IT OF COURSE YOU CAN'T TELL IT JUST AT FIRST ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE CROWDING INTO IT WITH GOLF CLUBS AND WEARING KNICKERBOCKERS AND FLAT CAPS WOULD DECEIVE ANYBODY
WHEN A WHOLE NATION WAS AFOOT TO FIGHT AND WHO WOULD NOT FIGHT THE SPANIARDS WHEN THEY CUT OFF BRITISH SAILORS EARS THAT WAS AN OLD TALE BY THIS TIME BUT THE FLAMES OF ANGER THREW IT INTO LURID RELIEF ONCE MORE
AND LOVED IT TOO FOR THE LITTLE TOWN IN THE SUNSHINE THAT IT RAN TO
MARIPOSA PEOPLE OH YES THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF THEM ON THE TRAIN EVERY DAY BUT OF COURSE YOU HARDLY RECOGNIZE THEM WHILE THE TRAIN IS STILL PASSING THROUGH THE SUBURBS
FOUGHT IN EGYPT FOR QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE MEMBER OF IT WHO REPRESENTED WOLFE ON THAT OCCASION IN THE PAGEANT OF THE QUEBEC CAMPAIGN
AND BUSINESSLIKE INTENTION OF SIFTING THE MATTER TO THE BOTTOM THAT HE MIGHT DISPROVE HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY AND SET HIMSELF RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES IN SELF DEFENSE HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ROSSLAND AN OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK DOWN WITH COLD FACTS
THE DISTURBING SOMETHING WHICH HIS MIND HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY BUILT UP BUT THE NEW ALAN REVOLTED HE WANTED TO CARRY THE THING AWAY WITH HIM HE WANTED IT TO LIVE AND SO IT WENT WITH HIM UNCONTAMINATED BY ANY TRUTHS OR LIES
BUT SINCE SUCH TREATMENT GIVES A TOTALLY FALSE IDEA OF HIS ACHIEVEMENT THIS LITTLE SKETCH DRAWN STRAIGHT FROM ORIGINAL SOURCES TRIES TO SHOW HIM AS HE REALLY WAS A CO WORKER WITH THE BRITISH FLEET IN A WAR BASED ENTIRELY ON NAVAL STRATEGY
BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING EXCEPTIONALLY ANXIOUS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF DISEASE FOR A SICKLY BOY IN A FAR OFF LAND OF PESTILENCE AND FEVER SHE HAD WRITTEN TO HIM THE VERY DAY HE LEFT
IT'S GOD'S OWN COUNTRY WE HAVE NORTH OF FIFTY EIGHT OLAF AND WE HAVE TEN TIMES THE WEALTH OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN CARE FOR A MILLION PEOPLE EASILY BUT BAD POLITICS AND BAD JUDGMENT BOTH HERE IN ALASKA AND AT WASHINGTON
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SALMON SHOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO US IF THE BARS ARE LET DOWN ALL AT ONCE TO THE FINANCIAL BANDITTI UNDERSTANDING AND COMMON SENSE MUST GUARD THE GATES
NO DON'T BOTHER TO LOOK AT THE REFLECTION OF YOUR FACE IN THE WINDOW PANE SHADOWED BY THE NIGHT OUTSIDE NOBODY COULD TELL YOU NOW AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
BUT OF COURSE HOME WOULD HARDLY BE THE WORD YOU WOULD APPLY TO THE LITTLE TOWN UNLESS PERHAPS LATE AT NIGHT WHEN YOU'D BEEN SITTING READING IN A QUIET CORNER SOMEWHERE SUCH A BOOK AS THE PRESENT ONE NATURALLY YOU DON'T KNOW OF THE MARIPOSA TRAIN NOW
AS AN ENSIGN IN THE TWELFTH REGIMENT OF FOOT HE WAS NOW FIFTEEN AN OFFICER A SOLDIER BORN AND BRED EAGER TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY AND JUST APPOINTED TO A REGIMENT ORDERED TO THE FRONT
AND SMILED GRIMLY INTO OLAF'S BEARDED FACE THEN WE CAN COUNT ON THAT THING COMING ACROSS THE NECK OF SEA FROM THE GULF OF ANADYR HE FINISHED AND IF IT EVER DOES COME THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES WILL AT LAST
LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE IT EVERY DAY THINK IT'S ONLY THE TRAIN TO THE GOLF GROUNDS BUT THE JOKE IS THAT AFTER IT PASSES OUT OF THE CITY AND THE SUBURBS AND THE GOLF GROUNDS IT TURNS ITSELF LITTLE BY LITTLE INTO THE MARIPOSA TRAIN
J WOLFE TO MISSUS WOLFE AT HER HOUSE IN GREENWICH KENT WOLFE'S VERY GOOD STATE OF HEALTH WAS NOT LIKELY TO CONTINUE SO EITHER IN CAMP OR ON BOARD SHIP
THE YELLOW FELLOWS WILL COME OUT SOME DAY FROM THAT RUMBLED THE OLD SOUR DOUGH STRIKING HIS PIPE IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND AND WHEN THEY DO THEY WON'T COME OVER TO US IN ONES AN TWOS AN THREES BUT IN MILLIONS THAT'S WHAT THE YELLOW FELLOWS WILL DO
YOU USED TO WANDER DOWN TO THE STATION ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AFTER YOUR WORK AND WATCH THE MARIPOSA PEOPLE GETTING ON THE TRAIN AND WISH THAT YOU COULD GO WHY YOU KNEW THAT TRAIN AT ONE TIME BETTER I SUPPOSE THAN ANY OTHER SINGLE THING IN THE CITY
IT WAS TO BE ONE OF THE GRANDEST AND FINEST HOUSES THAT THOUGHT COULD CONCEIVE MUCH FINER IN TRUE REALITY THAN THAT VAST PALACE OF SANDSTONE WITH THE PORTE COCHERE AND THE SWEEPING CONSERVATORIES THAT YOU AFTERWARDS BUILT IN THE COSTLIER PART OF THE CITY
WHILE HE WAS ATTENDING TO HIS AFFAIRS AT THE BANK OLAF SECURED INFORMATION THAT ROSSLAND WAS RESTING COMFORTABLY IN THE HOSPITAL AND HAD NOT ONE CHANCE IN TEN OF DYING IT WAS NOT ALAN'S INTENTION TO SEE HIM
BUT THE MARINES WERE NOT THE CORPS FOR HIM THEIR SERVICE COMPANIES WERE FIVE THOUSAND MILES AWAY WHILE WAR WITH FRANCE WAS BREAKING OUT MUCH NEARER HOME SO WHAT WAS HIS DELIGHT AT RECEIVING ANOTHER COMMISSION ON MARCH TWENTY FIFTH SEVENTEEN FORTY TWO
YOU'VE GOT TO COMBINE THAT WITH BOLSHEVISM THE MENACE OF BLACKEST RUSSIA A DISEASE WHICH IF IT CROSSES THE LITTLE NECK OF WATER AND GETS HOLD OF ALASKA WILL SHAKE THE AMERICAN CONTINENT TO BED ROCK
HERE AND THERE IN THE CROWD THOSE PEOPLE WITH THE CLOTHES THAT ARE PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT AND YET LOOK ODD IN SOME WAY THE WOMEN WITH THE PECULIAR HATS
LIKE A SMOLDERING CLOUD BUT YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE DANGER HE SAID IT WON'T COME FROM JAPAN TO CALIFORNIA IT WILL POUR LIKE A FLOOD THROUGH SIBERIA AND JUMP TO ALASKA IN A NIGHT IT ISN'T THE DANGER OF THE YELLOW MAN ALONE OLAF
IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY NINE THE OTHER HOUSE IS SQUERRYES COURT BELONGING THEN AND NOW TO THE WARDE FAMILY THE WOLFES CLOSEST FRIENDS WOLFE AND GEORGE WARDE WERE CHUMS FROM THE FIRST DAY THEY MET
MANY OF HIS ANCESTORS HAD STOOD READY TO FIGHT FOR KING AND COUNTRY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE HIS FATHER FOUGHT UNDER THE GREAT DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH IN THE WAR AGAINST FRANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HIS GRANDFATHER HIS GREAT GRANDFATHER HIS ONLY UNCLE
BUT IF YOU HAVE HALF FORGOTTEN MARIPOSA AND LONG SINCE LOST THE WAY TO IT YOU ARE ONLY LIKE THE GREATER PART OF THE MEN HERE IN THIS MAUSOLEUM CLUB IN THE CITY WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT THAT PRACTICALLY EVERY ONE OF THEM CAME FROM MARIPOSA ONCE UPON A TIME
THAT THE TRAIN WAS THERE EVERY AFTERNOON PUFFING UP STEAM IN THE CITY STATION AND THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BOARDED IT ANY DAY AND GONE HOME NO NOT HOME OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T CALL IT HOME NOW
AND ALL ABOUT THEM THE WONDER OF WILD ROSES AND PURPLE IRIS AND WHITE SEAS OF SEDGE COTTON AND YELLOW EYED DAISIES AND BIRDS SINGING IN THE GLADNESS OF SUMMER HE HEARD THE BIRDS
TO WIPE AWAY THE SHADOWS OF TRAGEDY MARY STANDISH WAS WITH HIM AGAIN BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AT SKAGWAY SHE WAS AT HIS SIDE IN THE HEART OF THE TUNDRAS THE SUN IN HER SHINING HAIR AND EYES
A LONG PEACE HAD MADE THE COUNTRY INDIFFERENT TO THE WELFARE OF THE ARMY AND NAVY NOW MEN WERE SUDDENLY BEING MASSED TOGETHER IN CAMPS AND FLEETS AS IF ON PURPOSE TO BREED DISEASE SANITATION ON A LARGE SCALE NEVER HAVING BEEN PRACTISED IN PEACE
HOME MEANS THAT BIG RED SANDSTONE HOUSE OF YOURS IN THE COSTLIER PART OF THE CITY HOME MEANS IN A WAY THIS MAUSOLEUM CLUB WHERE YOU SOMETIMES TALK WITH ME
INSIDE WAS A COMMISSION AS SECOND LIEUTENANT IN THE MARINES
SHIPS WERE FITTING OUT IN ENGLISH HARBOURS SOLDIERS WERE MARCHING INTO EVERY ENGLISH CAMP CROWDS WERE SINGING AND CHEERING FIRST ONE BOY'S FATHER AND THEN ANOTHER'S WAS UNDER ORDERS FOR THE FRONT AMONG THEM WAS WOLFE'S FATHER
WHICH ROSSLAND MIGHT HAVE TOLD HIM THEY LEFT CORDOVA EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND AT SUNSET THAT EVENING CAMPED ON THE TIP OF A WOODED ISLAND A MILE OR TWO FROM THE MAINLAND OLAF KNEW THE ISLAND
AND THE DUKE OF CUMBERLAND CAME DOWN TO REVIEW THEM
ALREADY THE CONDUCTOR HAS CHANGED HIS GLAZED HAT FOR AN ORDINARY ROUND CHRISTIE
YOU WOULD TAKE THE TRAIN AND GO BACK TO THE LITTLE TOWN TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE NOW AND IF THINGS HAD CHANGED MUCH SINCE YOUR DAY BUT EACH TIME WHEN YOUR HOLIDAYS CAME SOMEHOW YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND AND WENT DOWN TO
THE LANKY RED HAIRED BOY OF THIRTEEN AND A HALF TOOK HIS SEAT ON THE PORTSMOUTH COACH BESIDE HIS FATHER THE VETERAN SOLDIER OF FIFTY FIVE HIS MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF MUCH TOO FINE A SPIRIT TO GRUDGE ANYTHING FOR THE SERVICE OF HER COUNTRY
BESIDES IF IT IS NOT I WOULD DO IT OUT OF LOVE WITH PLEASURE I AM SORRY TO HEAR THAT YOUR HEAD IS SO BAD WHICH I FEAR IS CAUSED BY YOUR BEING SO MELANCHOLY BUT PRAY DEAR MAMMA IF YOU LOVE ME DON'T GIVE YOURSELF UP TO FEARS FOR US
THE WOODS I SAY FOR THE FARMS ARE THINNING OUT AND THE TRACK PLUNGES HERE AND THERE INTO GREAT STRETCHES OF BUSH TALL TAMERACK AND RED SCRUB WILLOW
HE CURSED COSSACK LAW AND THE PROHIBITORY MEASURES TO KEEP AMERICANS OUT MORE GOLD WAS OVER THERE THAN HAD EVER BEEN DREAMED OF IN ALASKA EVEN THE MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS WERE UNNAMED AND HE WAS GOING IF HE LIVED ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO
THAT DULL RESERVE THAT SEEMED TO HOLD THE PASSENGERS IN THE ELECTRIC SUBURBAN HAS CLEAN VANISHED AND GONE THEY ARE TALKING LISTEN OF THE HARVEST AND THE LATE ELECTION AND OF HOW THE LOCAL MEMBER IS MENTIONED FOR THE CABINET AND ALL THE OLD FAMILIAR TOPICS OF THE SORT
NOR HAS THE MARTIAL SPIRIT DESERTED THE DESCENDANTS OF THE WOLFES IN THE GENERATION NOW ALIVE THEY ARE SOLDIERS STILL THE PRESENT HEAD OF THE FAMILY WHO REPRESENTED IT AT THE CELEBRATION OF THE TERCENTENARY OF THE FOUNDING OF QUEBEC
HOW GORGEOUS IT ONCE SEEMED AND WITH A BOX STOVE SET UP IN ONE END OF IT THE STOVE IS BURNING FURIOUSLY AT ITS STICKS THIS AUTUMN EVENING FOR THE AIR SETS IN CHILL AS YOU GET CLEAR AWAY FROM THE CITY
AND ALWAYS THEY AWAKENED HIM SO THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT THE STARS AGAIN AND TRYING NOT TO THINK IN SPITE OF THE GRIEF IN HIS SOUL THEY WERE PLEASANT DREAMS AS THOUGH SOME GENTLE FORCE WERE AT WORK IN HIM SUBCONSCIOUSLY
AND IT PLEASED HIM TO THINK SHE WOULD HAVE MADE THIS SAME FIGHT FOR ALASKA IF SHE HAD LIVED IT WAS A THOUGHT WHICH BROUGHT A PAINFUL THICKENING IN HIS BREATH FOR ALWAYS THESE VISIONS WHICH OLAF COULD NOT SEE ENDED WITH MARY STANDISH
I SUPPOSE VERY PROBABLY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ONE OF THESE WOOD ENGINES SINCE YOU WERE A BOY FORTY YEARS AGO THE OLD ENGINE WITH A WIDE TOP LIKE A HAT ON ITS FUNNEL AND WITH SPARKS ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP A SUIT FOR DAMAGES ONCE IN EVERY MILE
WHEN THE SQUIRE HANDED HIM HIS FIRST COMMISSION AND THERE IT IS TO DAY AND ON IT ARE THE VERSES ENDING THIS SPOT SO SACRED WILL FOREVER CLAIM A PROUD ALLIANCE WITH ITS HERO'S NAME WOLFE WAS AT LAST AN OFFICER
AND THE BUBBLING OF COFFEE OVER A BED OF COALS WITH THE MYSTERIOUS DARKNESS OF THE TIMBER GATHERING IN ABOUT HIM
BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT WHEN THE CITY IS WELL BEHIND YOU BIT BY BIT THE TRAIN CHANGES ITS CHARACTER THE ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE THAT TOOK YOU THROUGH THE CITY TUNNELS IS OFF NOW
WOLFE'S MOTHER TO WHOM HE OWED A GREAT DEAL OF HIS GENIUS WAS A DESCENDANT OF TWO GOOD FAMILIES IN YORKSHIRE SHE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIS FATHER AND WAS VERY TALL AND HANDSOME WOLFE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO ONE LIKE HER
WAS BORN IN ENGLAND AND AS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF HIS ANCESTORS IN IRELAND HAD MARRIED OTHER THAN ENGLISH PROTESTANTS AND AS WOLFE'S MOTHER WAS ALSO ENGLISH WE MAY SAY THAT THE VICTOR OF QUEBEC WAS A PURE BRED ENGLISHMAN
AND THAT MARY STANDISH WOULD ALWAYS LIVE IN HIS THOUGHTS NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED IN THE YEARS TO COME BUT HE WAS NOT THE SORT TO LET ANY PART OF HIMSELF WITHER UP AND DIE BECAUSE OF A BLOW THAT HAD DARKENED HIS MENTAL VISIONS OF THINGS HIS PLANS LAY AHEAD OF HIM
MOST FORTUNATELY WOLFE WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO TAKE ILL AND SO HE WAS SENT HOME IN TIME TO SAVE HIM FROM THE FEVERS OF SPANISH AMERICA WOLFE WAS HAPPY TO SEE HIS MOTHER AGAIN TO HAVE HIS PONY TO RIDE AND HIS DOGS TO PLAY WITH
BY REASON I WAS AT CAMP TO SEE THE REGIMENTS OFF TO GO ON BOARD AND WAS TOO LATE FOR THE POST BUT AM VERY SORRY DEAR MAMMA THAT YOU DOUBT MY LOVE WHICH I'M SURE IS AS SINCERE AS EVER ANY SON'S WAS TO HIS MOTHER
BUT NO WONDER THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE FIVE O'CLOCK TRAIN FOR MARIPOSA VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT HUNDREDS OF THEM KNOW THAT THERE IS A TRAIN THAT GOES OUT AT FIVE O'CLOCK BUT THEY MISTAKE IT EVER SO MANY OF THEM THINK IT'S JUST A SUBURBAN TRAIN
WHY SURELY YES LAKE OSSAWIPPI THE BIG LAKE AS THEY USED TO CALL IT FROM WHICH THE RIVER RUNS DOWN TO THE SMALLER LAKE LAKE WISSANOTTI WHERE THE TOWN OF MARIPOSA HAS LAIN WAITING FOR YOU THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS
PRAY MY LOVE TO MY BROTHER PRAY MY SERVICE TO MISTER STRETON AND HIS FAMILY TO MISTER AND MISSUS WESTON AND TO GEORGE WARDE WHEN YOU SEE HIM AND PRAY BELIEVE ME TO BE MY DEAREST MAMMA YOUR MOST DUTIFUL LOVING AND AFFECTIONATE SON
SWINGING THE CURVE OF THE EMBANKMENT AT A BREAKNECK SPEED AS IT ROUNDS THE CORNER OF THE LAKE HOW FAST THE TRAIN GOES THIS AUTUMN NIGHT YOU HAVE TRAVELLED I KNOW YOU HAVE IN THE EMPIRE STATE EXPRESS
WHEN HE WAS A COLONEL AND HAD BEEN THROUGH THE WARS AND AT COURT HE STILL BELIEVED SHE WAS A MATCH FOR ALL THE BEAUTIES HE WAS NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO TAKE AFTER HER IN LOOKS EXCEPT IN HER ONE WEAK FEATURE A CUTAWAY CHIN HIS BODY INDEED
YOU'D GO BACK HOME AGAIN TO THE LITTLE TOWN AND BUILD A GREAT BIG HOUSE WITH A FINE VERANDAH NO STINT ABOUT IT THE BEST THAT MONEY COULD BUY PLANED LUMBER EVERY SQUARE FOOT OF IT AND A FINE PICKET FENCE IN FRONT OF IT
ASK YOUR NEIGHBOUR THERE AT THE NEXT TABLE WHETHER THE PARTRIDGE THAT THEY SOMETIMES SERVE TO YOU HERE CAN BE COMPARED FOR A MOMENT TO THE BIRDS THAT HE AND YOU OR HE AND SOME ONE ELSE USED TO SHOOT AS BOYS IN THE SPRUCE THICKETS ALONG THE LAKE
IT MAY BE A GENERATION FROM NOW MAYBE A CENTURY BUT IT'S COMING SURE AS GOD MAKES LIGHT IF WE LET ALASKA GO DOWN AND OUT AND MY WAY OF PREVENTING IT IS DIFFERENT FROM YOURS HE STARED INTO THE FIRE
THERE IS THE BRIDGE ITSELF AND THE LONG ROAR OF THE TRAIN AS IT RUSHES SOUNDING OVER THE TRESTLE WORK THAT RISES ABOVE THE MARSH HEAR THE CLATTER AS WE PASS THE SEMAPHORES AND SWITCH LIGHTS WE MUST BE CLOSE IN NOW
WHERE HE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AT SWINDEN'S HERE HE WORKED QUIETLY ENOUGH TILL JUST BEFORE HE ENTERED ON HIS TEENS THEN THE LONG PENT RAGE OF ENGLAND SUDDENLY BURST IN WAR WITH SPAIN THE PEOPLE WENT WILD WHEN THE BRITISH FLEET TOOK PORTO BELLO
BUT HE FULL OF THE STIR AND EXCITEMENT OF A BIG CAMP HAD CARRIED THE LETTER IN HIS POCKET FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE ANSWERING IT THEN HE WROTE HER THE FIRST OF MANY LETTERS FROM DIFFERENT SEATS OF WAR THE LAST ONE OF ALL BEING WRITTEN JUST BEFORE HE WON THE VICTORY
A SPANISH PORT IN CENTRAL AMERICA THE NEWS WAS CRIED THROUGH THE STREETS ALL NIGHT THE NOISE OF BATTLE SEEMED TO BE SOUNDING ALL ROUND SWINDEN'S SCHOOL WHERE MOST OF THE BOYS BELONGED TO NAVAL AND MILITARY FAMILIES
AND INSEPARABLY CONNECTED WITH INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
TO THE FORCES ASSEMBLING IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT
THAT THAT TRAIN OF MINGLED FLAT CARS AND COACHES THAT GOES TEARING INTO THE NIGHT
ANY LIFE OF WOLFE CAN BE ARTIFICIALLY SIMPLIFIED BY TREATING HIS PURELY MILITARY WORK AS SOMETHING COMPLETE IN ITSELF
SCARCELY A NIGHT RIDE ACROSS THE NECK OF BERING SEA AND YET AS PROSCRIBED AS THE SACRED PLAINS OF TIBET IT STIRRED OLD DESIRES IN ALAN'S BLOOD FOR HE KNEW THAT OF ALL FRONTIERS THE SIBERIAN WOULD BE THE LAST AND THE GREATEST
AND THAT NOT ONLY MEN BUT NATIONS WOULD PLAY THEIR PART IN THE BREAKING OF IT HE SAW THE RED GLEAM OF FIRELIGHT IN OLAF'S EYES AND IF WE DON'T GO IN FIRST FROM THIS SIDE ALAN
TWO OTHER HOUSES IN THE LITTLE COUNTRY TOWN OF WESTERHAM ARE FULL OF MEMORIES OF WOLFE ONE OF THESE WAS HIS FATHER'S A HOUSE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS BORN
SIBERIA WAS DRAGGING HIM THAT FORBIDDEN WORLD OF ADVENTURE AND MYSTERY AND MONUMENTAL OPPORTUNITY WHICH LAY ONLY A FEW MILES ACROSS THE STRAIT FROM THE SEWARD PENINSULA IN HIS ENTHUSIASM HE FORGOT ALAN'S TRAGEDY
PERHAPS IF YOU HAD COME BACK NOW AND AGAIN JUST AT ODD TIMES IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO THERE YOU HEAR IT
TWICE HE HAD TRIED IT SINCE HIS OLD COMRADE HAD DIED AND TWICE HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN OUT THE NEXT TIME HE WOULD KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT AND HE INVITED ALAN TO GO WITH HIM THERE WAS A THRILL IN THIS TALK OF A LAND SO NEAR
ARE OF AN OLD AND HONOURABLE LINE MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO THEIR FOREFATHERS LIVED IN ENGLAND AND LATER ON IN WALES LATER STILL IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY BEFORE AMERICA WAS DISCOVERED THEY WERE LIVING IN IRELAND WOLFE'S FATHER HOWEVER
WOLFE WAS DETERMINED TO GO AND FIGHT NOTHING COULD STOP HIM THERE WAS NO COMMISSION FOR HIM AS AN OFFICER NEVER MIND HE WOULD GO AS A VOLUNTEER AND WIN HIS COMMISSION IN THE FIELD SO ONE HOT DAY IN JULY SEVENTEEN FORTY
WATCHING THE EMBERS FLARE UP AND DIE I'M NOT PROUD OF THE STATES HE WENT ON AS IF SPEAKING TO SOMETHING WHICH HE SAW IN THE FLAMES I CAN'T BE AFTER THE RUIN THEIR UNINTELLIGENT PROPAGANDA AND LEGISLATION HAVE BROUGHT UPON ALASKA
AND HAD CHOSEN IT FOR REASONS OF HIS OWN IT WAS PRIMITIVE AND ALIVE WITH BIRDS OLAF LOVED THE BIRDS AND THE CHEER OF THEIR VESPER SONG AND BEDTIME TWITTER COMFORTED ALAN HE SEIZED AN AX
ONE TWO THREE
BOTH WISHED TO GO INTO THE ARMY AND BOTH OF COURSE PLAYED SOLDIERS LIKE OTHER VIRILE BOYS WARDE LIVED TO BE AN OLD MAN AND ACTUALLY DID BECOME A FAMOUS CAVALRY LEADER
AND HE HEARD THE GIRL'S VOICE ANSWERING THEM IN HER HAPPINESS AND TURNING THAT HAPPINESS FROM THE RADIANCE OF HER EYES UPON HIM
WOLFE'S PARENTS WENT TO LIVE AT WESTERHAM IN KENT SHORTLY AFTER THEY WERE MARRIED AND THERE ON JANUARY SECOND SEVENTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
THIS IS LAKE OSSAWIPPI SURELY ENOUGH YOU WOULD KNOW IT ANYWHERE BY THE BROAD STILL BLACK WATER WITH HARDLY A RIPPLE AND WITH THE GRIP OF THE COMING FROST ALREADY ON IT SUCH A GREAT SHEET OF BLACKNESS IT LOOKS AS THE TRAIN THUNDERS ALONG THE SIDE
AND THE NEW LIMITED AND THE MARITIME EXPRESS THAT HOLDS THE RECORD OF SIX HUNDRED WHIRLING MILES FROM PARIS TO MARSEILLES BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO THIS THIS MAD CAREER THIS BREAKNECK SPEED THIS THUNDERING ROAR OF THE MARIPOSA LOCAL DRIVING HARD TO ITS HOME
OLAF FELT RESTING UPON HIM SOMETHING OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A DOCTOR AND AFTER SUPPER HE SAT WITH HIS BACK TO A TREE AND TALKED OF THE OLD DAYS AS IF THEY WERE YESTERDAY AND THE DAY BEFORE
DO YOU SEE TOO THAT THE TRIM LITTLE CARS THAT CAME OUT OF THE CITY ON THE ELECTRIC SUBURBAN EXPRESS ARE BEING DISCARDED NOW AT THE WAY STATIONS ONE BY ONE AND IN THEIR PLACE IS THE OLD FAMILIAR CAR WITH THE STUFF CUSHIONS IN RED PLUSH
BUT WE CAN NOT BECAUSE EVERYTHING UP HERE IS LOCKED AWAY FROM US I REPEAT THAT ISN'T CONSERVATION IF THEY HAD APPLIED A LITTLE OF IT TO THE SALMON INDUSTRY BUT THEY DIDN'T AND THE SALMON ARE GOING LIKE THE BUFFALO OF THE PLAINS
DON'T TELL ME THAT THE SPEED IS ONLY TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS
BILL AND SAM AS IF THEY WERE ALL ONE FAMILY WHAT IS IT NOW NINE THIRTY AH THEN WE MUST BE NEARING THE TOWN THIS BIG BUSH THAT WE ARE PASSING THROUGH YOU REMEMBER IT SURELY AS THE GREAT SWAMP JUST THIS SIDE OF THE BRIDGE OVER THE OSSAWIPPI
HIS OLD AMBITIONS AND HIS DREAMS OF ACHIEVEMENT THEY SEEMED PULSELESS AND DEAD NOW BUT HE KNEW IT WAS BECAUSE HIS OWN FIRE HAD TEMPORARILY BURNED OUT AND HE REALIZED THE VITAL NECESSITY OF BUILDING IT UP AGAIN
BUT THOUGH HE TRIED HIS BEST TO STICK TO HIS LESSONS HIS HEART WAS WILD FOR THE WAR HE AND GEORGE WARDE USED TO GO EVERY DAY DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS BEHIND THE PIGEON HOUSE AT SQUERRYES COURT AND PRACTISE WITH THEIR SWORDS AND PISTOLS
THE SOLDIER WHO WON CANADA FOR ENGLAND IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY NINE SAT UNDER THE ARMS OF THE KING IN WHOSE SERVICE THE SAILOR CABOT HOISTED THE FLAG OF ENGLAND OVER CANADIAN SOIL IN FOURTEEN NINETY SEVEN
AMONG HIS ANGLO IRISH KINSMEN WERE THE GOLDSMITHS AND THE SEYMOURS OLIVER GOLDSMITH HIMSELF
FACE THE TRAGIC REALIZATION OF WHAT ALASKA COULD HAVE MEANT TO THE NATION
AND WITH A TANGLED UNDERGROWTH OF BUSH THAT HAS DEFIED FOR TWO GENERATIONS ALL ATTEMPTS TO CLEAR IT INTO THE FORM OF FIELDS WHY LOOK THAT GREAT SPACE THAT SEEMS TO OPEN OUT
THEY HAVE LENGTHENED OUT THE TRAIN BY THIS TIME WITH A STRING OF FLAT CARS AND FREIGHT CARS BETWEEN WHERE WE ARE SITTING AND THE ENGINE BUT AT EVERY CROSSWAY
AND THAT THERE ISN'T ONE OF THEM THAT DOESN'T SOMETIMES DREAM IN THE DULL QUIET OF THE LONG EVENING HERE IN THE CLUB THAT SOME DAY HE WILL GO BACK AND SEE THE PLACE THEY ALL DO ONLY THEY'RE HALF ASHAMED TO OWN IT
YES AND THE BEST TOO THE MOST COMFORTABLE THE MOST RELIABLE THE MOST LUXURIOUS AND THE SPEEDIEST TRAIN THAT EVER TURNED A WHEEL AND THE MOST GENIAL
THE FIGHT WE MUST WIN IS TO BRING ABOUT AN HONEST AND REASONABLE ADJUSTMENT OLAF AND THAT FIGHT WILL TAKE PLACE RIGHT HERE IN ALASKA AND NOT IN SIBERIA AND IF WE DON'T WIN HE RAISED HIS EYES FROM THE FIRE
SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING SHE CONSULTED ANNE WHO NEVER SEEMED CONSIDERED BY THE OTHERS AS HAVING ANY INTEREST IN THE QUESTION SHE CONSULTED AND IN A DEGREE WAS INFLUENCED BY HER
SHE WOULD IMPROVE HER SHE WOULD DETACH HER FROM HER BAD ACQUAINTANCE AND INTRODUCE HER INTO GOOD SOCIETY SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING
TURNING FROM THE SOCIETY OF SO DESERVING A SISTER TO BESTOW HER AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE ON ONE WHO OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER BUT THE OBJECT OF DISTANT CIVILITY FROM SITUATION MISSUS CLAY WAS IN LADY RUSSELL'S
SHE WILL NEVER SUBMIT TO ANY THING REQUIRING INDUSTRY AND PATIENCE AND A SUBJECTION OF THE FANCY TO THE UNDERSTANDING WHERE MISS TAYLOR FAILED TO STIMULATE I MAY SAFELY AFFIRM THAT HARRIET SMITH WILL DO NOTHING
HE WOULD SOONER QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AT ONCE THAN REMAIN IN IT ON SUCH DISGRACEFUL TERMS QUIT KELLYNCH HALL THE HINT WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN UP BY MISTER SHEPHERD WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S RETRENCHING
AND PERHAPS NO MAN CAN BE A GOOD JUDGE OF THE COMFORT A WOMAN FEELS IN THE SOCIETY OF ONE OF HER OWN SEX AFTER BEING USED TO IT ALL HER LIFE I CAN IMAGINE YOUR OBJECTION TO HARRIET SMITH SHE IS NOT THE SUPERIOR YOUNG WOMAN WHICH EMMA'S FRIEND OUGHT TO BE
ISABELLA SLOW AND DIFFIDENT AND EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE EMMA HAS BEEN MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AND OF YOU ALL IN HER MOTHER SHE LOST THE ONLY PERSON ABLE TO COPE WITH HER SHE INHERITS HER MOTHER'S TALENTS AND MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER SUBJECTION TO HER
OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL AND HELP AND RECOMMEND THE MINCED CHICKEN AND SCALLOPED OYSTERS WITH AN URGENCY WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE
I WILL NOT RAISE ANY OUTCRY I WILL KEEP MY ILL HUMOUR TO MYSELF I HAVE A VERY SINCERE INTEREST IN EMMA ISABELLA DOES NOT SEEM MORE MY SISTER HAS NEVER EXCITED A GREATER INTEREST PERHAPS HARDLY SO GREAT
MUST STILL SEE HEAR AND REMEMBER EMMA IS SPOILED BY BEING THE CLEVEREST OF HER FAMILY AT TEN YEARS OLD SHE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHICH PUZZLED HER SISTER AT SEVENTEEN SHE WAS ALWAYS QUICK AND ASSURED
OH YOU WOULD RATHER TALK OF HER PERSON THAN HER MIND WOULD YOU VERY WELL I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY EMMA'S BEING PRETTY PRETTY SAY BEAUTIFUL RATHER CAN YOU IMAGINE ANY THING NEARER PERFECT BEAUTY THAN EMMA ALTOGETHER
DO YOU REALLY THINK IT A BAD THING WHY SO I THINK THEY WILL NEITHER OF THEM DO THE OTHER ANY GOOD
IT HAS BEEN SO MANY YEARS MY PROVINCE TO GIVE ADVICE THAT YOU CANNOT BE SURPRIZED MISTER KNIGHTLEY AT THIS LITTLE REMAINS OF OFFICE NOT AT ALL CRIED HE I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR IT
TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MISTER WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS YOUTH
AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY THE HAPPINESS OF MISS SMITH WAS QUITE EQUAL TO HER INTENTIONS MISS WOODHOUSE WAS SO GREAT A PERSONAGE IN HIGHBURY
WHICH HAD BEEN HAPPILY ENGRAFTED ON THE BEGINNING HE WAS NOT ONLY TO QUIT HIS HOME BUT TO SEE IT IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS A TRIAL OF FORTITUDE WHICH STRONGER HEADS THAN SIR WALTER'S HAVE FOUND TOO MUCH KELLYNCH HALL WAS TO BE LET
SHE WAS A CLEVER YOUNG WOMAN WHO UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF PLEASING
AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO
WHAT EVERY COMFORT OF LIFE KNOCKED OFF JOURNEYS LONDON SERVANTS HORSES TABLE CONTRACTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS EVERY WHERE TO LIVE NO LONGER WITH THE DECENCIES EVEN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN NO
AND WAS CONSIDERED WITH ALL THE REGARD AND RESPECT WHICH A HARMLESS OLD LADY UNDER SUCH UNTOWARD CIRCUMSTANCES CAN EXCITE HER DAUGHTER ENJOYED A MOST UNCOMMON DEGREE OF POPULARITY
COMPREHENDED MANY SUCH NOT UNFREQUENTLY THROUGH EMMA'S PERSUASION HE HAD SOME OF THE CHOSEN AND THE BEST TO DINE WITH HIM BUT EVENING PARTIES WERE WHAT HE PREFERRED AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY
HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES IN TALKING AND LISTENING AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN BETWEENS
AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY NOT UNWILLING TO TALK
IT WAS A MUCH SAFER PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN IN HIS PREDICAMENT HE MIGHT THERE BE IMPORTANT AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EXPENSE TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT
HOW CAN EMMA IMAGINE SHE HAS ANY THING TO LEARN HERSELF WHILE HARRIET IS PRESENTING SUCH A DELIGHTFUL INFERIORITY AND AS FOR HARRIET I WILL VENTURE TO SAY THAT SHE CANNOT GAIN BY THE ACQUAINTANCE
SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT
THERE IS AN ANXIETY A CURIOSITY IN WHAT ONE FEELS FOR EMMA I WONDER WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER SO DO I SAID MISSUS WESTON GENTLY VERY MUCH
WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING
SEEM AS LITTLE TO TEMPT HER TO BREAK HER RESOLUTION AT PRESENT SAID MISSUS WESTON AS CAN WELL BE AND WHILE SHE IS SO HAPPY AT HARTFIELD I CANNOT WISH HER TO BE FORMING ANY ATTACHMENT WHICH WOULD BE CREATING SUCH DIFFICULTIES ON POOR MISTER WOODHOUSE'S ACCOUNT
FROM THE OPPOSITION OF TWO LEADING PRINCIPLES SHE WAS OF STRICT INTEGRITY HERSELF WITH A DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR BUT SHE WAS AS DESIROUS OF SAVING SIR WALTER'S FEELINGS AS SOLICITOUS FOR THE CREDIT OF THE FAMILY
WHY TO OWN THE TRUTH I AM AFRAID YOU ARE RATHER THROWN AWAY AND THAT WITH EVERY DISPOSITION TO BEAR THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO BE BORNE WE WILL NOT DESPAIR HOWEVER WESTON MAY GROW CROSS FROM THE WANTONNESS OF COMFORT OR HIS SON MAY PLAGUE HIM
I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF EMMA'S DOCTRINES GIVE ANY STRENGTH OF MIND OR TEND AT ALL TO MAKE A GIRL ADAPT HERSELF RATIONALLY
I CONSIDER MYSELF YOU KNOW AS HAVING SOMEWHAT OF THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEECH THAT EMMA'S MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD THE LIBERTY OF HINTING THAT I DO NOT THINK ANY POSSIBLE GOOD CAN ARISE FROM HARRIET SMITH'S INTIMACY BEING MADE A MATTER OF MUCH DISCUSSION AMONG YOU PRAY EXCUSE ME
LONDON BATH OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY ALL ANNE'S WISHES HAD BEEN FOR THE LATTER A SMALL HOUSE IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE THEY MIGHT STILL HAVE LADY RUSSELL'S SOCIETY STILL BE NEAR MARY
MISSUS BATES THE WIDOW OF A FORMER VICAR OF HIGHBURY WAS A VERY OLD LADY ALMOST PAST EVERY THING BUT TEA AND QUADRILLE SHE LIVED WITH HER SINGLE DAUGHTER IN A VERY SMALL WAY
THAT A TRAIN OF TWENTY YOUNG COUPLE NOW WALKED AFTER HER TO CHURCH SHE WAS A PLAIN MOTHERLY KIND OF WOMAN WHO HAD WORKED HARD IN HER YOUTH AND NOW THOUGHT HERSELF ENTITLED TO THE OCCASIONAL HOLIDAY OF A TEA VISIT
HIS CARE FOR THEIR HEALTH MADE HIM GRIEVE THAT THEY WOULD EAT SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND
BUT YOU WERE PREPARING YOURSELF TO BE AN EXCELLENT WIFE ALL THE TIME YOU WERE AT HARTFIELD YOU MIGHT NOT GIVE EMMA SUCH A COMPLETE EDUCATION AS YOUR POWERS WOULD SEEM TO PROMISE BUT YOU WERE RECEIVING A VERY GOOD EDUCATION FROM HER
I HOPE NOT THAT IT IS NOT LIKELY NO MISTER KNIGHTLEY DO NOT FORETELL VEXATION FROM THAT QUARTER NOT I INDEED I ONLY NAME POSSIBILITIES I DO NOT PRETEND TO EMMA'S GENIUS FOR FORETELLING AND GUESSING
A LARGER SOCIETY WOULD IMPROVE THEM SHE WANTED HER TO BE MORE KNOWN THE UNDESIRABLENESS OF ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR SIR WALTER WAS CERTAINLY MUCH STRENGTHENED BY ONE PART AND A VERY MATERIAL PART OF THE SCHEME
KNOWING WESTON TO BE OUT AND THAT YOU MUST STILL FIGHT YOUR OWN BATTLE MISTER WESTON WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORT ME IF HE WERE HERE FOR HE THINKS EXACTLY AS I DO ON THE SUBJECT WE WERE SPEAKING OF IT ONLY YESTERDAY AND AGREEING HOW FORTUNATE IT WAS FOR EMMA
THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT
I AM SURE YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT ME UNFIT FOR THE OFFICE I HELD YES SAID HE SMILING YOU ARE BETTER PLACED HERE
THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH A GIRL IN HIGHBURY FOR HER TO ASSOCIATE WITH MISTER KNIGHTLEY I SHALL NOT ALLOW YOU TO BE A FAIR JUDGE IN THIS CASE YOU ARE SO MUCH USED TO LIVE ALONE
ELIZABETH HAD BEEN LATELY FORMING AN INTIMACY WHICH SHE WISHED TO SEE INTERRUPTED IT WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER SHEPHERD WHO HAD RETURNED AFTER AN UNPROSPEROUS MARRIAGE TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE WITH THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF TWO CHILDREN
WE MUST BE SERIOUS AND DECIDED
THIS WILL CERTAINLY BE THE BEGINNING OF ONE OF OUR QUARRELS ABOUT EMMA MISTER KNIGHTLEY
OR ANY THING WHICH PROFESSED IN LONG SENTENCES OF REFINED NONSENSE TO COMBINE LIBERAL ACQUIREMENTS WITH ELEGANT MORALITY UPON NEW PRINCIPLES AND NEW SYSTEMS
HARTFIELD WILL ONLY PUT HER OUT OF CONCEIT WITH ALL THE OTHER PLACES SHE BELONGS TO SHE WILL GROW JUST REFINED ENOUGH TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THOSE AMONG WHOM BIRTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE PLACED HER HOME
SHE HAD A VALUE FOR RANK AND CONSEQUENCE WHICH BLINDED HER A LITTLE TO THE FAULTS OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED THEM HERSELF THE WIDOW OF ONLY A KNIGHT SHE GAVE THE DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE AND SIR WALTER
THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS
YOU NEVER COULD PERSUADE HER TO READ HALF SO MUCH AS YOU WISHED YOU KNOW YOU COULD NOT I DARE SAY REPLIED MISSUS WESTON SMILING THAT I THOUGHT SO THEN BUT SINCE WE HAVE PARTED I CAN NEVER REMEMBER EMMA'S OMITTING TO DO ANY THING I WISHED
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY MISTER KNIGHTLEY TO BE DEPENDENT ON YOUR RECOMMENDATION HAD I QUITTED MISTER WOODHOUSE'S FAMILY AND WANTED ANOTHER SITUATION
AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER THAN BECAUSE ELIZABETH DESERVED IT SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION
IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT SIR WALTER COULD MATERIALLY ALTER HIS STYLE OF LIVING IN A HOUSE WHICH HAD SUCH A CHARACTER OF HOSPITALITY AND ANCIENT DIGNITY TO SUPPORT IN ANY OTHER PLACE SIR WALTER MIGHT JUDGE FOR HIMSELF AND WOULD BE LOOKED UP TO AS REGULATING THE MODES OF LIFE
THAT THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE AND THE SUPPER TABLE WHICH ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE
THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER THE FRIENDS FROM WHOM SHE HAD JUST PARTED THOUGH VERY GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE MUST BE DOING HER HARM THEY WERE A FAMILY OF THE NAME OF MARTIN
THAT THE PROSPECT OF THE INTRODUCTION HAD GIVEN AS MUCH PANIC AS PLEASURE BUT THE HUMBLE GRATEFUL LITTLE GIRL WENT OFF WITH HIGHLY GRATIFIED FEELINGS
UNDER HIS PRESENT DIFFICULTIES THEY MUST RETRENCH THAT DID NOT ADMIT OF A DOUBT BUT SHE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT DONE WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE PAIN TO HIM AND ELIZABETH SHE DREW UP PLANS OF ECONOMY
THE LIST SHE DREW UP WHEN ONLY FOURTEEN I REMEMBER THINKING IT DID HER JUDGMENT SO MUCH CREDIT THAT I PRESERVED IT SOME TIME AND I DARE SAY SHE MAY HAVE MADE OUT A VERY GOOD LIST NOW BUT I HAVE DONE WITH EXPECTING ANY COURSE OF STEADY READING FROM EMMA
AND STILL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES SEEING THE LAWNS AND GROVES OF KELLYNCH WAS THE OBJECT OF HER AMBITION BUT THE USUAL FATE OF ANNE ATTENDED HER IN HAVING SOMETHING VERY OPPOSITE FROM HER INCLINATION FIXED ON SHE DISLIKED BATH AND DID NOT THINK IT AGREED WITH HER
STRICT IN HER NOTIONS OF DECORUM AND WITH MANNERS THAT WERE HELD A STANDARD OF GOOD BREEDING SHE HAD A CULTIVATED MIND AND WAS GENERALLY SPEAKING RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT BUT SHE HAD PREJUDICES ON THE SIDE OF ANCESTRY
THERE IS HARDLY ANY DESIRING TO REFRESH SUCH A MEMORY AS THAT SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY FEELINGLY AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE HAD DONE BUT I HE SOON ADDED WHO HAVE HAD NO SUCH CHARM THROWN OVER MY SENSES
THIS HOWEVER WAS A PROFOUND SECRET NOT TO BE BREATHED BEYOND THEIR OWN CIRCLE SIR WALTER COULD NOT HAVE BORNE THE DEGRADATION OF BEING KNOWN TO DESIGN LETTING HIS HOUSE MISTER SHEPHERD HAD ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD ADVERTISE
AS TO HAVE BEEN ALREADY STAYING THERE MORE THAN ONCE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT LADY RUSSELL WHO THOUGHT IT A FRIENDSHIP QUITE OUT OF PLACE COULD HINT OF CAUTION AND RESERVE LADY RUSSELL INDEED HAD SCARCELY ANY INFLUENCE WITH ELIZABETH
SERLE UNDERSTANDS BOILING AN EGG BETTER THAN ANY BODY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU
A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUSTICE AND EQUITY IF WE CAN PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO ALL THIS SAID LADY RUSSELL LOOKING OVER HER PAPER MUCH MAY BE DONE IF HE WILL ADOPT THESE REGULATIONS IN SEVEN YEARS HE WILL BE CLEAR
SHE CONSIDERED IT AS AN ACT OF INDISPENSABLE DUTY TO CLEAR AWAY THE CLAIMS OF CREDITORS WITH ALL THE EXPEDITION WHICH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RETRENCHMENTS COULD SECURE AND SAW NO DIGNITY IN ANYTHING SHORT OF IT SHE WANTED IT TO BE PRESCRIBED
THAT THEY SHOULD LOSE NEITHER CONSEQUENCE NOR ENJOYMENT BY SETTLING THERE LADY RUSSELL FELT OBLIGED TO OPPOSE HER DEAR ANNE'S KNOWN WISHES
FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER HE COULD COMMAND THE VISITS OF HIS OWN LITTLE CIRCLE IN A GREAT MEASURE AS HE LIKED HE HAD NOT MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE HIS HORROR OF LATE HOURS AND LARGE DINNER PARTIES
FACE AND FIGURE I
AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL
MADE HIM UNFIT FOR ANY ACQUAINTANCE BUT SUCH AS WOULD VISIT HIM ON HIS OWN TERMS FORTUNATELY FOR HIM HIGHBURY INCLUDING RANDALLS IN THE SAME PARISH AND DONWELL ABBEY IN THE PARISH ADJOINING THE SEAT OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY
THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM AND THE SMILES OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING THROWN AWAY
THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS
ON HIS OWN TERMS AND AS A GREAT FAVOUR THAT HE WOULD LET IT AT ALL HOW QUICK COME THE REASONS FOR APPROVING WHAT WE LIKE LADY RUSSELL HAD ANOTHER EXCELLENT ONE AT HAND FOR BEING EXTREMELY GLAD THAT SIR WALTER AND HIS FAMILY WERE TO REMOVE FROM THE COUNTRY
BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL
SHE HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY VERY EARNEST IN TRYING TO GET ANNE INCLUDED IN THE VISIT TO LONDON SENSIBLY OPEN TO ALL THE INJUSTICE
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND AS EMMA WANTS TO SEE HER BETTER INFORMED IT WILL BE AN INDUCEMENT TO HER TO READ MORE HERSELF THEY WILL READ TOGETHER SHE MEANS IT I KNOW EMMA HAS BEEN MEANING TO READ MORE EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
BUT I CONFESS THAT I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A FACE OR FIGURE MORE PLEASING TO ME THAN HERS BUT I AM A PARTIAL OLD FRIEND SUCH AN EYE THE TRUE HAZLE EYE AND SO BRILLIANT REGULAR FEATURES
OR MY DREAD OF ITS DOING THEM BOTH HARM AND I MISTER KNIGHTLEY AM EQUALLY STOUT IN MY CONFIDENCE OF ITS NOT DOING THEM ANY HARM WITH ALL DEAR EMMA'S LITTLE FAULTS SHE IS AN EXCELLENT CREATURE WHERE SHALL WE SEE A BETTER DAUGHTER
SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS HER YOUTH HAD PASSED WITHOUT DISTINCTION AND HER MIDDLE OF LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE CARE OF A FAILING MOTHER AND THE ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE A SMALL INCOME GO AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
AND WAS NOW JUST RETURNED FROM A LONG VISIT IN THE COUNTRY TO SOME YOUNG LADIES WHO HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL THERE WITH HER SHE WAS A VERY PRETTY GIRL AND HER BEAUTY HAPPENED TO BE OF A SORT WHICH EMMA PARTICULARLY ADMIRED SHE WAS SHORT
AS RENTING A LARGE FARM OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND RESIDING IN THE PARISH OF DONWELL VERY CREDITABLY SHE BELIEVED SHE KNEW MISTER KNIGHTLEY THOUGHT HIGHLY OF THEM BUT THEY MUST BE COARSE AND UNPOLISHED
AND WHO WAS PERFECTLY PERSUADED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE WITHOUT A CHANGE OF ABODE SINCE THE IDEA HAD BEEN STARTED IN THE VERY QUARTER WHICH OUGHT TO DICTATE HE HAD NO SCRUPLE HE SAID IN CONFESSING HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE
FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER AND IN WINTER DRESSED THEIR CHILBLAINS WITH HER OWN HANDS IT WAS NO WONDER
MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT
LADY RUSSELL WAS MOST ANXIOUSLY ZEALOUS ON THE SUBJECT AND GAVE IT MUCH SERIOUS CONSIDERATION SHE WAS A WOMAN RATHER OF SOUND THAN OF QUICK ABILITIES WHOSE DIFFICULTIES IN COMING TO ANY DECISION IN THIS INSTANCE WERE GREAT
OR A KINDER SISTER OR A TRUER FRIEND NO NO SHE HAS QUALITIES WHICH MAY BE TRUSTED SHE WILL NEVER LEAD ANY ONE REALLY WRONG SHE WILL MAKE NO LASTING BLUNDER WHERE EMMA ERRS ONCE SHE IS IN THE RIGHT A HUNDRED TIMES
AND ON MANY LESSER OCCASIONS HAD ENDEAVOURED TO GIVE ELIZABETH THE ADVANTAGE OF HER OWN BETTER JUDGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE BUT ALWAYS IN VAIN ELIZABETH WOULD GO HER OWN WAY AND NEVER HAD SHE PURSUED IT IN MORE DECIDED OPPOSITION TO LADY RUSSELL THAN IN THIS SELECTION OF MISSUS CLAY
AND HAVING FORMERLY OWED MUCH TO MISTER WOODHOUSE'S KINDNESS FELT HIS PARTICULAR CLAIM ON HER TO LEAVE HER NEAT PARLOUR HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY WORK WHENEVER SHE COULD AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE
AND BATH WAS TO BE HER HOME SIR WALTER HAD AT FIRST THOUGHT MORE OF LONDON BUT MISTER SHEPHERD FELT THAT HE COULD NOT BE TRUSTED IN LONDON AND HAD BEEN SKILFUL ENOUGH TO DISSUADE HIM FROM IT AND MAKE BATH PREFERRED
WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
THAT KELLYNCH HALL HAS A RESPECTABILITY IN ITSELF WHICH CANNOT BE AFFECTED BY THESE REDUCTIONS AND THAT THE TRUE DIGNITY OF SIR WALTER ELLIOT WILL BE VERY FAR FROM LESSENED IN THE EYES OF SENSIBLE PEOPLE
WHAT A BLOOM OF FULL HEALTH AND SUCH A PRETTY HEIGHT AND SIZE SUCH A FIRM AND UPRIGHT FIGURE THERE IS HEALTH NOT MERELY IN HER BLOOM BUT IN HER AIR HER HEAD HER GLANCE ONE HEARS SOMETIMES OF A CHILD BEING THE PICTURE OF HEALTH
BUT SUPPOSING ANY LITTLE INCONVENIENCE MAY BE APPREHENDED FROM THE INTIMACY IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT EMMA ACCOUNTABLE TO NOBODY BUT HER FATHER WHO PERFECTLY APPROVES THE ACQUAINTANCE SHOULD PUT AN END TO IT SO LONG AS IT IS A SOURCE OF PLEASURE TO HERSELF
IN MARKING OUT THE SCHEME OF RETRENCHMENT WHICH WAS AT LAST SUBMITTED TO SIR WALTER EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT
NOW EMMA ALWAYS GIVES ME THE IDEA OF BEING THE COMPLETE PICTURE OF GROWN UP HEALTH SHE IS LOVELINESS ITSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY IS NOT SHE I HAVE NOT A FAULT TO FIND WITH HER PERSON HE REPLIED I THINK HER ALL YOU DESCRIBE I LOVE TO LOOK AT HER
WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY A NOTE WAS BROUGHT FROM MISSUS GODDARD REQUESTING IN MOST RESPECTFUL TERMS
AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET AMONG THE MOST COME AT ABLE OF WHOM WERE MISSUS AND MISS BATES AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD
IN WHATEVER WAY HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE OF DOUBT AND INDECISION THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE EMMA IN LOVE AND IN SOME DOUBT OF A RETURN IT WOULD DO HER GOOD BUT THERE IS NOBODY HEREABOUTS TO ATTACH HER AND SHE GOES SO SELDOM FROM HOME THERE DOES INDEED
AND FELT AS A DUTY SHE RATED LADY RUSSELL'S INFLUENCE HIGHLY AND AS TO THE SEVERE DEGREE OF SELF DENIAL WHICH HER OWN CONSCIENCE PROMPTED SHE BELIEVED THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE MORE DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING THEM TO A COMPLETE THAN TO HALF A REFORMATION
THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT AND HAPPY WAS SHE FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE IN THE POWER THOUGH AS FAR AS SHE WAS HERSELF CONCERNED IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON
SHE ALWAYS DECLARES SHE WILL NEVER MARRY WHICH OF COURSE MEANS JUST NOTHING AT ALL BUT I HAVE NO IDEA THAT SHE HAS YET EVER SEEN A MAN SHE CARED FOR IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD THING FOR HER TO BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH A PROPER OBJECT
THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS
AND YET SHE WAS A HAPPY WOMAN AND A WOMAN WHOM NO ONE NAMED WITHOUT GOOD WILL IT WAS HER OWN UNIVERSAL GOOD WILL AND CONTENTED TEMPER WHICH WORKED SUCH WONDERS SHE LOVED EVERY BODY
EMMA MUST DO HARRIET GOOD AND BY SUPPLYING HER WITH A NEW OBJECT OF INTEREST HARRIET MAY BE SAID TO DO EMMA GOOD I HAVE BEEN SEEING THEIR INTIMACY WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE HOW VERY DIFFERENTLY WE FEEL NOT THINK THEY WILL DO EACH OTHER ANY GOOD
BY PASSING ALL THE WARM MONTHS WITH HER AT KELLYNCH LODGE EVERY DANGER WOULD BE AVOIDED AND IT WAS IN FACT A CHANGE WHICH MUST DO BOTH HEALTH AND SPIRITS GOOD ANNE HAD BEEN TOO LITTLE FROM HOME TOO LITTLE SEEN HER SPIRITS WERE NOT HIGH
AND SOMEBODY HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR TO THAT OF PARLOUR BOARDER THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN OF HER HISTORY SHE HAD NO VISIBLE FRIENDS BUT WHAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED AT HIGHBURY
AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST OF LADY RUSSELL'S TOO GENTLE REDUCTIONS HOW ANNE'S MORE RIGID REQUISITIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE LADY RUSSELL'S HAD NO SUCCESS AT ALL COULD NOT BE PUT UP WITH WERE NOT TO BE BORNE
PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
ROUND THE BRIGHT AIR WITH FOOTING TRUE
FAIR ARE GROWN UP PEOPLE'S TREES
LOOKING AFTER YOU OF COURSE THAT'S WHY YOU LOCKED THE DOOR I SUPPOSE TO KEEP ME OUT SHE HAD NO ANSWER READY BUT LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE STRUCK ME
AND PEEPING ROUND SAW THAT MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CORRECT IT WAS THE KELPIE SHE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER VERY SOFTLY AFRAID OF BEING LOCKED OUT A DANGER WHICH HAD SCARCELY OCCURRED TO ME BEFORE
CLEARER GROW AND SPARROW'S WINGS BEAT ON WINDOW LEDGES THESE SHALL WAKE THE YAWNING MAID SHE THE DOOR SHALL OPEN FINDING DEW ON GARDEN GLADE
TO BLUE SPARKLING WITH GOLD I COULD SEE MUCH BETTER AND FANCIED I COULD HEAR BETTER TOO
I WENT HOME AT A GOOD GALLOP TOOK OFF THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE AND LAID THEM IN A CART IN THE SHED TURNED MISSY LOOSE INTO THE STABLE SHUT THE DOOR AND RAN ACROSS THE FIELD TO THE MANSE
OLD DIAMOND HAD SO MUCH ADO TO STOP THE CAB AGAINST IT
CAME UP AND MAKING GOOD USE OF HIS STICK DROVE THEM OFF NOW MY LITTLE MAN HE SAID GET ON WHILE YOU CAN
SENSIBLE TALKING WE ON OUR FEET MUST GO
IN THE EAST A BREAKING IN THE HEDGES AND THE WHINS SLEEPING BIRDS A WAKING IN THE DARKNESS SHAPES OF THINGS HOUSES TREES AND HEDGES
IF YOU DIDN'T MIND TAKING ME TO CHISWICK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY YOU WHEN WE GOT THERE IT'S A LONG WAY BUT YOU SHALL HAVE THE WHOLE FARE FROM THE DOCKS AND SOMETHING OVER VERY WELL SIR SAID DIAMOND I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY
THEN TURNED TO THE CAB AND SAID BEFORE MISTER EVANS HAD QUITE BEGUN TO THINK SOMETHING MUST BE AMISS PLEASE SIR MY HARNESS HAS GIVEN AWAY WOULD YOU MIND STEPPING IN HERE FOR A FEW MINUTES THEY'RE FRIENDS OF MINE I'LL TAKE YOU WHERE YOU LIKE AFTER I'VE GOT IT MENDED
SO DIAMOND RAN IN AND HAD ANOTHER MOUTHFUL OF TEA AND BREAD AND BUTTER AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO TIRED AS HE WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE HE STARTED QUITE FRESH THIS MORNING IT WAS A CLOUDY DAY AND THE WIND BLEW HARD FROM THE NORTH
ALL UP THE VALE FROM THE AUTUMN BONFIRES SEE THE SMOKE TRAIL PLEASANT SUMMER OVER AND ALL THE SUMMER FLOWERS
WHICH IS ALL ABOUT DIAMOND IF HE HAD KNOWN THAT MISS COLEMAN THOUGHT MISTER EVANS WAS DEAD PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE MANAGED DIFFERENTLY THERE WAS A CRY AND A RUNNING TO AND FRO IN THE HOUSE
TELL MISS COLEMAN IT'S MISS COLEMAN HE WANTS TO SEE I DON'T KNOW SAID THE MAID HE DON'T LOOK MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN HE IS THOUGH AND I KNOW HIM AND SO DOES MISS COLEMAN
I CAME TO TAKE JAMIE HOME BUT HE WON'T GO YOU'RE A SILLY BOY TO THINK MY BROTHER JOHN WOULD DO HIM ANY HARM SHE RETURNED YOU'RE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH AREN'T YOU JAMIE DUFF
YOU HAD BETTER TELL HIM TOO I SAID THIS NOT THAT I DID NOT BELIEVE SHE HAD BEEN OUT TO LOOK FOR ME BUT BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE HAD LOCKED THE DOOR TO ANNOY ME
FOR HE HAD NEVER MADE HIMSELF THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE FIRM'S AFFAIRS FEW SPECULATIVE PEOPLE DO KNOW THEIR OWN AFFAIRS HENCE HE NEVER DOUBTED HE SHOULD FIND MATTERS MUCH AS HE LEFT THEM
NOTWITHSTANDING IN FACT I OWED THE GREATER PART OF THE COURAGE I POSSESSED
SOON THE FRAIL EGGS THEY SHALL CHIP AND UPSPRINGING MAKE ALL THE APRIL WOODS
CHILD AND GARDEN FLOWER AND SUN VANISH ALL THINGS MORTAL AS THE BUILDING SHADOWS FALL AS THE RAYS DIMINISH UNDER EVENING'S CLOAK THEY ALL
DO ALL HE COULD HOWEVER HE COULD NOT RECALL WHERE OR WHEN
FOR DOORS WERE SELDOM LOCKED IN THE SUMMER NIGHTS IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY SHE MADE ME NO REPLY BUT TURNED AND LEFT ME NOT EVEN SHUTTING THE DOOR
WHEN A MAN THINKS OF WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY IN SUCH A CASE HE MAY LOVE BUT HIS LOVE IS BUT A POOR AFFAIR MISTER COLEMAN TOOK HIM INTO THE FIRM AS A JUNIOR PARTNER
BUT FOR ALL THAT'S GONE AND COME I SHALL FIND MY SOLDIER DUMB HE HAS LIVED A LITTLE THING IN THE GRASSY WOODS OF SPRING DONE IF HE COULD TELL ME TRUE
BUT DIAMOND WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF THINKING ONLY OF HIMSELF HE SAW THAT HIS NEW FRIEND LOOKED WEARY IF NOT ILL AND VERY POOR WON'T YOU JUMP IN SIR HE SAID I WILL TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU LIKE
THE SHADOWS WERE VERY DIFFERENT TOO SOMEHOW THEY WERE LIKER TO THE LIGHT THAT MADE THEM THAN THE SUN SHADOWS ARE TO THE SUNLIGHT BOTH THE LIGHT AND THE SHADOWS OF THE MOON WERE STRANGE AND FEARFUL TO ME
GARDEN DARKENED DAISY SHUT CHILD IN BED THEY SLUMBER GLOW WORM IN THE HALLWAY RUT MICE AMONG THE LUMBER
THAT'S VERY UNGRATEFUL OF YOU JAMIE I SAID FULL OF MY OWN IMPORTANCE WHEN I'VE COME SO FAR AND ALL AT NIGHT TOO TO SET YOU FREE I'M FREE ENOUGH SAID JAMIE
I SHALL LET YOUR FATHER KNOW OF YOUR GOINGS ON SHE SAID RECOVERING HERSELF A LITTLE YOU NEED NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE I SHALL TELL HIM MYSELF AT BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
HE DIGS THE FLOWERS GREEN RED AND BLUE NOR WISHES TO BE SPOKEN TO HE DIGS THE FLOWERS AND CUTS THE HAY AND NEVER SEEMS TO WANT TO PLAY
THE GARDENER DOES NOT LOVE TO TALK HE MAKES ME KEEP THE GRAVEL WALK AND WHEN HE PUTS HIS TOOLS AWAY HE LOCKS THE DOOR AND TAKES THE KEY
WHEN THE LAWN IS SHAVEN CLEAR THEN MY HOLE SHALL REAPPEAR I SHALL FIND HIM NEVER FEAR I SHALL FIND MY GRENADIER
AND HOW HE HAD DONE AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT THEY ASKED HIM SUCH A MULTITUDE OF QUESTIONS SOME OF WHICH HE COULD ANSWER AND SOME OF WHICH HE COULD NOT ANSWER AND HIS FATHER SEEMED EVER SO MUCH BETTER FROM FINDING THAT HIS BOY WAS ALREADY NOT ONLY USEFUL TO HIS FAMILY BUT USEFUL TO OTHER PEOPLE
JUST AS IT WAS SHUT AWAY TOY LIKE IN THE EVEN HERE I SEE IT GLOW WITH DAY UNDER GLOWING HEAVEN EVERY PATH AND EVERY PLOT
FOR THEY HARDLY KNOW LIGHT FROM DARKNESS WELL AT FIRST THE MOON FRIGHTENED ME A LITTLE SHE LOOKED SO KNOWING AND YET ALL SHE SAID ROUND ABOUT ME WAS SO STRANGE
BIRDS ALL THE SUNNY DAY FLUTTER AND QUARREL HERE IN THE ARBOUR LIKE TENT OF THE LAUREL HERE IN THE FORK THE BROWN NEST IS SEATED FOUR LITTLE BLUE EGGS
WHEN THE GRASS IS RIPE LIKE GRAIN
AND CERTAINLY AS OFTEN AS I DID SO IT ABATED FEAR IS A WORSE THING THAN DANGER I HAD TO PASS VERY NIGH THE POOL TO WHICH TURKEY AND I HAD GONE THE NIGHT OF OUR ADVENTURE WITH BOGBONNY'S BULL
THE DUSTY ATTIC SPIDER CLAD HE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE MAKETH GLAD AND THROUGH THE BROKEN EDGE OF TILES INTO THE LADDERED HAY LOFT SMILES
IN WHICH CASE IT IS THE ONE FRIGHTFUL THING TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO HE HAD COME BACK A MORE HUMBLE MAN AND LONGING TO ASK MISS COLEMAN TO FORGIVE HIM BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT RUIN HAD FALLEN UPON THEM
I GAVE THE CORD A GREAT TUG OF ANGER PULLED OUT MY KNIFE AND CUT IT THEN HAULING JAMIE UP GOT HIM HALF AWAKE AT LAST HE STARED WITH FRIGHT FIRST AND THEN BEGAN TO CRY
ONE GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED NEAR THE MEWS ENGAGED HIM TO CARRY HIM TO THE CITY EVERY MORNING AT A CERTAIN HOUR AND DIAMOND WAS PUNCTUAL AS CLOCKWORK THOUGH TO EFFECT THAT REQUIRED A GOOD DEAL OF CARE FOR HIS FATHER'S WATCH WAS NOT MUCH TO BE DEPENDED ON
AND DID WORK WORTH DOING FOR A FORTNIGHT DIAMOND WENT ON DRIVING HIS CAB AND KEEPING HIS FAMILY HE HAD BEGUN TO BE KNOWN ABOUT SOME PARTS OF LONDON
THOUGH CLOSER STILL THE BLINDS WE PULL TO KEEP THE SHADY PARLOUR COOL YET HE WILL FIND A CHINK OR TWO TO SLIP HIS GOLDEN FINGERS THROUGH
I HAVE SAID THAT HE HAD NOT BEHAVED VERY WELL TO MISS COLEMAN HE HAD PUT OFF THEIR MARRIAGE MORE THAN ONCE IN A COWARDLY FASHION
ALL THE NAMES I KNOW FROM NURSE GARDENER'S GARTERS SHEPHERD'S PURSE BACHELOR'S BUTTONS LADY'S SMOCK
SILLY GARDENER SUMMER GOES AND WINTER COMES WITH PINCHING TOES WHEN IN THE GARDEN BARE AND BROWN YOU MUST LAY YOUR BARROW DOWN
HE WAS JUST CLAMBERING UP AGAIN WHEN THE GENTLEMAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAID IT'S THE WILDERNESS MISTER COLEMAN'S PLACE BUT I'LL DIRECT YOU WHEN WE COME INTO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT FLASHED UPON DIAMOND WHO HE WAS
AND THE MORNING BROKEN THERE MY GARDEN GROWS AGAIN GREEN AND ROSY PAINTED AS AT EVE BEHIND THE PANE FROM MY EYES IT FAINTED
HALF STUPID WITH FATIGUE AND WANT OF FOOD MISTER EVANS YIELDED TO THE BOY'S SUGGESTION AND WALKED IN AT THE DOOR WHICH THE MAID HELD WITH DIFFICULTY AGAINST THE WIND SHE TOOK MISTER EVANS FOR A VISITOR AS INDEED HE WAS
AND IN LIFTING IT TO PULL HIM UP FOUND A CORD TIED TO HIS WRIST I WAS INDIGNANT
BUT I RODE QUIETLY UP TO THE BACK OF THE YARD WHERE THE RICKS STOOD GOT OFF MISSY AND FASTENED THE BRIDLE TO THE GATE AND WALKED ACROSS TO THE CART SHED WHERE THE MOON WAS SHINING UPON THE LADDER LEADING UP TO THE LOFT
SHE IS NOT ABLE FOR THIS FOR HER LIGHT IS NOT HER OWN IT IS SECOND HAND FROM THE SUN HIMSELF AND HER SHADOWS THEREFORE ALSO ARE SECOND HAND SHADOWS PIECES CUT OUT OF THE GREAT SUN SHADOW
WHICH HE COULD NOT REFUSE BECAUSE HIS MOTHER WANTED THEM SO MUCH AT HOME FOR HIS FATHER HE LEFT THEM NEARLY AS HAPPY AS THEY WERE THEMSELVES THE REST OF THE DAY HE DID BETTER AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT SO MUCH TO TAKE HOME AS THE DAY BEFORE
THE NEXT MORNING DIAMOND WAS UP ALMOST AS EARLY AS BEFORE HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR FROM HIS MOTHER NOW AND MADE NO SECRET OF WHAT HE WAS ABOUT BY THE TIME HE REACHED THE STABLE SEVERAL OF THE MEN WERE THERE
I FOLLOWED HER WITHOUT EVEN BIDDING HIM GOOD NIGHT OH YOU'VE GOT MISSY HAVE YOU SHE SAID SPYING HER WHERE SHE STOOD WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK OF MILK OR A PIECE OF OATCAKE BEFORE YOU GO
SO SAYING HE OPENED THE DOOR AND GOT IN AND DIAMOND DROVE AWAY BUT AS HE DROVE HE COULD NOT HELP FANCYING HE HAD SEEN THE GENTLEMAN FOR DIAMOND KNEW HE WAS A GENTLEMAN BEFORE
ARE ALL SO STRONG AND SO REAL AND SO FRIENDLY YOU SEEM TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM THEY BELONG TO YOUR HOUSE
AS SOON AS HE WAS AWAKE ENOUGH TO KNOW ME HE STOPPED CRYING BUT NOT STARING AND HIS EYES SEEMED TO HAVE NOTHING BETTER THAN MOONLIGHT IN THEM COME ALONG JAMIE I SAID I'M COME TO TAKE YOU HOME
DESIRING NOTHING BUT BED WHEN I CAME NEAR THE HOUSE FROM THE BACK I SAW A FIGURE ENTERING THE GATE FROM THE FRONT IT WAS IN THE FULL LIGHT OF THE MOON WHICH WAS NOW UP A GOOD WAY
SHE GAVE A CRY OF ALARM BUT PRESENTLY OPENED THE DOOR LOOKING PALE AND FRIGHTENED WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF DOORS THIS TIME OF THE NIGHT SHE ASKED BUT WITHOUT QUITE HER USUAL ARROGANCE
LEST HE SHOULD BE BLOWN AWAY BUT HE DID NOT REALLY MIND IT HIS HEAD WAS FULL OF THE DREAM HE HAD DREAMED
AND THINKING IT BETTER TO LET HIM HAVE HIS BAG IN THIS QUIET PLACE
FOR AS JAMIE EXPLAINED TO ME AFTERWARDS THE CORD WHICH WAS TIED TO HIS WRIST INSTEAD OF BEING MEANT TO KEEP HIM A PRISONER WAS A DEVICE OF HER KINDNESS TO KEEP HIM FROM BEING TOO FRIGHTENED
GREAT IS THE SUN AND WIDE HE GOES THROUGH EMPTY HEAVEN WITH REPOSE AND IN THE BLUE AND GLOWING DAYS
AND IT WAS IN A MEASURE THROUGH HIS INFLUENCE THAT HE ENTERED UPON THOSE SPECULATIONS WHICH RUINED HIM SO HIS LOVE HAD NOT BEEN A BLESSING THE SHIP WHICH NORTH WIND HAD SUNK WAS THEIR LAST VENTURE
I DARED NOT HAVE GONE ON MY OWN TWO LEGS IT WAS NOT THAT I COULD SO EASILY RUN AWAY WITH FOUR INSTEAD BUT THAT SOMEHOW I WAS LIFTED ABOVE THE ORDINARY LEVEL OF FEAR BY BEING UPON HER BACK
WHOM THE RELIEF OF BEING CARRIED HAD MADE LESS AND LESS INCLINED TO CARRY HIMSELF HAD BEEN TURNING OVER THINGS IN HIS MIND AND AS THEY PASSED THE MINT CALLED TO DIAMOND
AND HUNT FOR HER FOOD AND MAKE CLOTHES FOR HER HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE MOST FORTUNATE OF MEN
WITH THE MOON BEHIND IT I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS THE KELPIE COME AFTER ME FOR IT WAS A TALL WOMAN MY HEART GAVE A GREAT JUMP UP BUT I SWALLOWED IT DOWN
WITH ONLY THE WIDE SILENT FIELDS ABOUT ME AND THE WIDER AND MORE SILENT SKY OVER MY HEAD THE FEAR BEGAN TO RETURN I FANCIED SOMETHING STRANGE CREEPING ALONG EVERY DITCH
FAIRY PLACES FAIRY THINGS FAIRY WOODS WHERE THE WILD BEE WINGS TINY TREES FOR TINY DAMES THESE MUST ALL BE FAIRY NAMES
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR FAILURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN NOW ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE CLOUDS HAD CLEARED OFF AND THE NIGHT HAD CHANGED FROM BROWN AND GREY
AND COLOURED A LITTLE WITH THE MOON'S YELLOWNESS IF I WERE WRITING FOR GROWN PEOPLE I SHOULD TELL THEM THAT THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND THINGS BECAUSE THEY THINK ABOUT THEM AND ASK GOD TO TEACH THEM WALK IN THE SUNLIGHT
FOR THE ROUGHS WERE IN GREAT FORCE HOWEVER THERE BEING NO BLOCK NOT EVEN IN NIGHTINGALE LANE HE REACHED THE ENTRANCE OF THE WHARF AND SET DOWN HIS PASSENGER WITHOUT ANNOYANCE
TINY WOODS BELOW WHOSE BOUGHS SHADY FAIRIES WEAVE A HOUSE
AND HE'D BETTER GO HOME AGAIN AS FAST AS HE CAN IF JOHN ADAM SHOULD COME OUT I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN OR PERHAPS HE'D LIKE TO STOP AND KEEP YOU COMPANY NO THANK YOU MISS ADAM
THIS GARDEN GROUND THAT NOW YOU SMOKE YOUR PIPE AROUND HAS SEEN IMMORTAL ACTIONS DONE
WHICH WAY ARE YOU GOING TO CHARING CROSS BUT I DON'T MIND WHERE I GO WELL I AM VERY TIRED IF YOU WILL TAKE ME TO CHARING CROSS I SHALL BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU I HAVE WALKED FROM GRAVESEND
BUT HE WAS NOT PAST BEING TAUGHT AND HIS TROUBLES HAD DONE HIM NO END OF GOOD FOR THEY HAD MADE HIM DOUBT HIMSELF
SOMETHING SHAPELESS BUT WITH A TERRIBLE CRY IN IT NEXT I THOUGHT I SAW A SCARCELY VISIBLE FORM NOW LIKE A CREATURE ON ALL FOURS NOW LIKE A MAN FAR OFF
BUT AS HE TURNED TO GO BACK SOME IDLERS NOT CONTENT WITH CHAFFING HIM SHOWED A MIND TO THE FARE THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD GIVEN HIM THEY WERE JUST PULLING HIM OFF THE BOX AND DIAMOND WAS SHOUTING FOR THE POLICE WHEN A PALE FACED MAN
WE SHALL LOOK DOWN ON THE BIRDIES NO LONGER THEY SHALL GO FLYING WITH MUSICAL SPEECHES HIGH OVERHEAD IN THE TOPS OF THE BEECHES IN SPITE OF OUR WISDOM AND
YOUNGER THAN WE ARE O CHILDREN AND FRAILER SOON IN THE BLUE AIR THEY'LL BE SINGER AND SAILOR WE SO MUCH OLDER TALLER AND STRONGER
O'ER THE LAWN UP TO MY KNEE UNDER GRASS ALONE HE LIES LOOKING UP WITH LEADEN EYES SCARLET COAT AND POINTED GUN TO THE STARS AND TO THE SUN
THE MOMENT HE CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION HE CHANGED HIS COURSE FROM WESTWARD TO NORTHWARD AND WENT STRAIGHT FOR MISTER COLEMAN'S POOR LITTLE HOUSE IN HOXTON
I CLIMBED THE LADDER AND AFTER SEVERAL FAILURES SUCCEEDED IN FINDING HOW THE DOOR WAS FASTENED WHEN I OPENED IT THE MOONLIGHT GOT IN BEFORE ME
BUT IF HE HAD NOT FALLEN IN WITH DIAMOND HE WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING THERE FIRST WHAT WAS DIAMOND TO DO HE HAD HEARD HIS FATHER AND MOTHER DROP SOME REMARKS CONCERNING MISTER EVANS WHICH MADE HIM DOUBTFUL OF HIM
THANK YOU MY MAN BUT I HAVE NO MONEY SO I CAN'T OH I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY I SHALL BE MUCH HAPPIER IF YOU WILL GET IN YOU HAVE SAVED ME ALL I HAD I OWE YOU A LIFT SIR
IN THE DARKNESS HOUSES SHINE PARENTS MOVE THE CANDLES TILL ON ALL THE NIGHT DIVINE TURNS THE BEDROOM HANDLES TILL AT LAST THE DAY BEGINS
I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE HER APPEARANCE IT WAS PECULIAR ENOUGH FOR SHE HAD JUST GOT OUT OF BED AND THROWN AN OLD SHAWL ABOUT HER SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT TO LOOK AT
OLD AND SERIOUS
I DON'T WANT TO GO BEFORE THE MORNING AND HE BEGAN TO WHIMPER AGAIN DO YOU CALL THIS FREE I SAID HOLDING UP HIS WRIST WHERE THE REMNANT OF THE CORD WAS HANGING OH
ALMOST AS SOON AS MISTER EVANS WENT IN THE WIND BEGAN TO CEASE AND WAS NOW STILL DIAMOND FOUND THAT BY MAKING THE BREECHING JUST A LITTLE TIGHTER THAN WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE FOR THE OLD HORSE HE COULD DO VERY WELL FOR THE PRESENT
SAID JAMIE THAT'S ONLY BUT ERE HE GOT FARTHER THE MOONLIGHT IN THE LOFT WAS DARKENED I LOOKED HURRIEDLY TOWARDS THE DOOR THERE STOOD THE STRANGEST FIGURE
THE GREY SMOKE TOWERS SING A SONG OF SEASONS SOMETHING BRIGHT IN ALL FLOWERS IN THE SUMMER
BETWEEN THE TWO HOWEVER HE DID MAKE A SUCCESS OF IT AFTER THAT FORTNIGHT HIS FATHER WAS ABLE TO GO OUT AGAIN
TALKING BEE AND LADYBIRD
EVERY BLUSH OF ROSES EVERY BLUE FORGET ME NOT WHERE THE DEW REPOSES UP THEY CRY THE DAY IS COME ON THE SMILING VALLEYS
I WOULD NOT DISGRACE MYSELF BEFORE JAMIE IT WAS NOT THE KELPIE HOWEVER BUT THE KEEPER'S SISTER
NO THANK YOU I SAID I SHALL BE GLAD TO GO TO BED I SHOULD THINK SO SHE ANSWERED JAMIE IS QUITE COMFORTABLE I ASSURE YOU AND I'LL TAKE CARE HE'S IN TIME FOR SCHOOL IN THE MORNING
BUT COMING RAPIDLY TOWARDS ME ACROSS THE NEAREST FIELD IT ALWAYS VANISHED HOWEVER BEFORE IT CAME CLOSE THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT THE FASTER I RODE THE MORE FRIGHTENED I BECAME
AND OTHERS WHO TAKE THINGS BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE TELL THEM SO ARE ALWAYS WALKING IN THE STRANGE MOONLIGHT
IT WAS OF COURSE OF NO USE TO DRIVE MISTER EVANS TO CHISWICK BUT IF HE SHOULD TELL HIM WHAT HAD BEFALLEN THEM AND WHERE THEY LIVED NOW HE MIGHT PUT OFF GOING TO SEE THEM AND HE WAS CERTAIN THAT MISS COLEMAN AT LEAST MUST WANT VERY MUCH TO SEE MISTER EVANS
THE OTHER END HAD BEEN TIED TO HER WRIST THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENED HE MIGHT PULL HER
THE MAID COULD NOT BUT REMEMBER DIAMOND HAVING SEEN HIM WHEN HE AND HIS FATHER BROUGHT THE LADIES HOME SO SHE BELIEVED HIM
AND MISTER EVANS HAD GONE OUT WITH IT IN THE HOPE OF TURNING ITS CARGO TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE HE WAS ONE OF THE SINGLE BOAT LOAD WHICH MANAGED TO REACH A DESERT ISLAND
WE HAVE BEAT THE MORNING DRUM PLAYMATE
A CABMAN OUGHT TO BE ABOVE MINDING THE WEATHER AT LEAST SO DIAMOND THOUGHT AT LENGTH HE WAS CALLED TO A NEIGHBOURING HOUSE
AND HAD NO SUSPICION THEREFORE OF THE CHANGE OF DIRECTION BY THIS TIME THE WIND HAD INCREASED ALMOST TO A HURRICANE AND AS THEY HAD OFTEN TO HEAD IT IT WAS NO JOKE FOR EITHER OF THE DIAMONDS THE DISTANCE HOWEVER WAS NOT GREAT
SO HARD SOMETIMES THAT PERCHED ON THE BOX WITH JUST HIS TOES TOUCHING THE GROUND
HERE WE HAD BEST ON TIP TOE TREAD WHILE I FOR SAFETY MARCH AHEAD FOR THIS IS THAT ENCHANTED GROUND WHERE ALL WHO LOITER SLUMBER SOUND
FOR MY SPEED SEEMED TO DRAW THE TERRORS THE FASTER AFTER ME HAVING DISCOVERED THIS I CHANGED MY PLAN AND WHEN I FELT MORE FRIGHTENED DREW REIN AND WENT SLOWER
HERE IS SIMPLE SHEPHERD'S LAND HERE ARE THE FAIRY HOLLYHOCKS
I HAD NOT RIDDEN FAR FROM THE STABLE BEFORE I AGAIN FOUND MYSELF
AT LENGTH I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE KEEPER'S FARM AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE MOON PEEPED FROM BEHIND A HILL THROWING AS LONG SHADOWS AS THE SETTING SUN BUT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
FOR ALTHOUGH SHE TRIED TO PUT IT ON HER VOICE TREMBLED TOO MUCH I RETORTED THE QUESTION WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUT YOURSELF I SAID
IN A LITTLE WHILE MISTER EVANS CAME OUT AND ASKED HIM TO COME IN DIAMOND OBEYED AND TO HIS DELIGHT MISS COLEMAN PUT HER ARMS ROUND HIM AND KISSED HIM AND THERE WAS PAYMENT FOR HIM NOT TO MENTION THE FIVE PRECIOUS SHILLINGS SHE GAVE HIM
BUT HE GOT UPON HIS BOX TO ARRANGE HIS THOUGHTS BEFORE MAKING ANY REPLY THE GENTLEMAN WAS MISTER EVANS TO WHOM MISS COLEMAN WAS TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED
AWAY BEHIND THE CURRANT ROW WHERE NO ONE ELSE BUT COOK MAY GO FAR IN THE PLOTS
HE BARES TO ALL THE GARDEN GROUND AND SHEDS A WARM AND GLITTERING LOOK AMONG THE IVY'S INMOST NOOK ABOVE THE HILLS ALONG THE BLUE
THE FERN BELOW THEM CAUGHT ALL THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS THE WEATHER WAS SULTRY AND BROODINGLY STILL MARGARET USED TO TRAMP ALONG BY HER FATHER'S SIDE CRUSHING DOWN THE FERN WITH A CRUEL GLEE
THE RELATION IN WHICH INSTITUTIONAL RELIGION DOES OR SHOULD STAND TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE IS ALSO IN PART A MATTER FOR PSYCHOLOGY WHICH IS HERE CALLED UPON TO DEAL WITH THE RELIGIOUS ASPECT OF THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
THE PLACE AND THE LIFE SHE HAD LONGED FOR FOR YEARS AT THAT TIME OF ALL TIMES FOR YEARNING AND LONGING JUST BEFORE THE SHARP SENSES LOSE THEIR OUTLINES IN SLEEP
AND TO INDICATE SOME OF THE RESULTS WHICH MIGHT FOLLOW UPON ITS HEALTHY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO POINT OUT THAT EACH OF THESE SUBJECTS NEEDS AT LEAST A VOLUME TO ITSELF
THE OPPRESSION OF WHICH COULD NOT BE RELIEVED BY ANY DAILY ACTION SUCH AS COMFORTING THE SURVIVORS OR TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL IN HOPE OF LESSENING THE EVILS IN THE GENERATION TO COME MISTER HALE DID NOT GO OUT AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS AS MUCH AS USUAL
WHICH CANNOT BE BOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN HEIR LOOM AND SHOWS THAT SHE HAD ANCESTORS SO THE OWNER OF THE ANCESTRAL LACE BECAME WORTHY OF SOMETHING MORE THAN THE LANGUID EXERTION TO BE AGREEABLE TO A VISITOR
FOR INFORMATION ON THESE MATTERS THEY MUST GO TO LARGER AND MORE TECHNICAL WORKS MY AIM HERE IS THE MORE GENERAL ONE OF INDICATING FIRST THE CHARACTERISTIC EXPERIENCES DISCOVERABLE WITHIN ALL GREAT RELIGIONS
THE SUCCEEDING SECTIONS OF THE BOOK TREAT IN SOME DETAIL THE LIGHT CAST ON SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS BY MENTAL ANALYSIS A PROCESS WHICH NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE CONDUCTED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A DEGRADED MATERIALISM
AT THIS POINT MISTER THORNTON CAME IN JUST BEFORE GOING TO THE MILL MOTHER I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT IF THERE IS ANY LITTLE THING THAT COULD SERVE MISSUS HALE AS AN INVALID YOU WILL OFFER IT I'M SURE IF I CAN FIND IT OUT I WILL
WERE BY FAR THE LIGHTEST NEWEST AND MOST AMUSING THE BOOK SHELVES DID NOT AFFORD MUCH RESOURCE MARGARET TOLD HER MOTHER EVERY PARTICULAR OF HER LONDON LIFE TO ALL OF WHICH MISSUS HALE LISTENED WITH INTEREST
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE OUT IN A CAB YOU CAME HOME WITH A HEADACHE FROM THE JOLTING I NEVER COMPLAINED OF IT I'M SURE NO
A SIGNAL WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD OFTEN TO BE REPEATED BEFORE ANY ONE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO THE HOUR OF THE DAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS AND ATTEND TO HIM NOW MISTER HALE LOITERED ABOUT THE GARDEN IF THE MORNING WAS FINE AND IF NOT
AS SHE FELT IT YIELD UNDER HER LIGHT FOOT AND SEND UP THE FRAGRANCE PECULIAR TO IT OUT ON THE BROAD COMMONS INTO THE WARM SCENTED LIGHT SEEING MULTITUDES OF WILD FREE LIVING CREATURES REVELLING IN THE SUNSHINE
IF WE ONLY LIVED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARISH IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THERE WE SHOULD BE ALMOST WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE STANSFIELDS CERTAINLY THE GORMANS WOULD BE WITHIN A WALK GORMANS SAID MARGARET
HE WENT ABRUPTLY OUT OF THE ROOM AFTER SAYING THIS IF HE HAD STAID A MINUTE LONGER FANNY WOULD HAVE CRIED AT HIS TONE OF COMMAND EVEN WHEN HE USED THE WORDS YOU WILL OBLIGE ME
AS MISSUS THORNTON OBSERVED TO HERSELF SHE LIKED MISSUS HALE'S DOUBLE KNITTING FAR BETTER THAT WAS SENSIBLE OF ITS KIND THE ROOM ALTOGETHER WAS FULL OF KNICK KNACKS WHICH MUST TAKE A LONG TIME TO DUST AND TIME TO PEOPLE OF LIMITED INCOME WAS MONEY
AND GAVE THE FACE AN UNDECIDED EXPRESSION BUT HE HAD THE SAME LARGE SOFT EYES AS HIS DAUGHTER EYES WHICH MOVED SLOWLY AND ALMOST GRANDLY ROUND IN THEIR ORBITS AND WERE WELL VEILED BY THEIR TRANSPARENT WHITE EYELIDS
OR WHO ARE OFFENDED BY THE RESULTING DEMONSTRATIONS OF CONTINUITY BETWEEN OUR MOST HOMELY AND MOST LOFTY REACTIONS TO THE UNIVERSE MIGHT TAKE TO THEMSELVES THE PLAIN WORDS OF THOMAS A KEMPIS THOU ART A MAN AND NOT GOD THOU ART FLESH
MARGARET'S MANNER HAD AN EXTRA TINGE OF COLDNESS IN IT WHEN SHE NEXT SPOKE YOU HAVE GOOD CONCERTS HERE I BELIEVE
BEFORE WINTER FAIRLY SET IN ACCORDINGLY SHE WAS BUSY PREPARING HER BOARD ONE MORNING WHEN SARAH THE HOUSEMAID THREW WIDE OPEN THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND ANNOUNCED
THIS BOOK OWES ITS ORIGIN TO THE FACT THAT IN THE AUTUMN OF NINETEEN TWENTY ONE THE AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE OXFORD INVITED ME TO DELIVER THE INAUGURAL COURSE OF A LECTURESHIP IN RELIGION NEWLY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE WILL OF THE LATE PROFESSOR UPTON
AND SHE REPINED EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY THAT HER HUSBAND WHO WAS MORE LEARNED THAN MISTER HUME A BETTER PARISH PRIEST THAN MISTER HOULDSWORTH SHOULD NOT HAVE MET WITH THE PREFERMENT THAT THESE TWO FORMER NEIGHBOURS OF THEIRS HAD DONE
WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER HER FATHER SEEMED THE BEST PERSON TO APPLY TO FOR INFORMATION AND WHEN WITH HIM
NOT ABSOLUTELY BASED ON A KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS IS EASILY BANISHED FOR A TIME BY A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY OR SOME HAPPY OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHEN THE BRILLIANT FOURTEEN FINE DAYS OF OCTOBER CAME ON
ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
SHE HAD LEARNT DRAWING WITH EDITH AND SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY REGRETTED DURING THE GLOOM OF THE BAD WEATHER HER IDLE REVELLING IN THE BEAUTY OF THE WOODLANDS WHILE IT HAD YET BEEN FINE TO MAKE HER DETERMINED TO SKETCH WHAT SHE COULD
ARE THOSE THE GORMANS WHO MADE THEIR FORTUNES IN TRADE AT SOUTHAMPTON OH I'M GLAD WE DON'T VISIT THEM I DON'T LIKE SHOPPY PEOPLE I THINK WE ARE FAR BETTER OFF KNOWING ONLY COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS
AND NO ANGEL SINCE MY SUBJECT IS NOT THE SPLENDOR OF HISTORIC SANCTITY BUT THE NORMAL LIFE OF THE SPIRIT AS IT MAY BE AND IS LIVED IN THE HERE AND NOW
MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN SOME COTTAGE IN THE GREEN SHADE OF THE FOREST HER OUT OF DOORS LIFE WAS PERFECT HER IN DOORS LIFE HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
BY HER CONSCIOUS PRIDE IN BEING ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEM ALL IF NEED WERE BUT THE CLOUD NEVER COMES IN THAT QUARTER OF THE HORIZON FROM WHICH WE WATCH FOR IT THERE HAD BEEN SLIGHT COMPLAINTS AND PASSING REGRETS ON HER MOTHER'S PART
I CALL MINE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE TASTE I LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHOSE OCCUPATIONS HAVE TO DO WITH LAND I LIKE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND THE THREE LEARNED PROFESSIONS AS THEY CALL THEM
BUT THE EVENINGS WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO FILL UP AGREEABLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER TEA HER FATHER WITHDREW INTO HIS SMALL LIBRARY AND SHE AND HER MOTHER WERE LEFT ALONE MISSUS HALE HAD NEVER CARED MUCH FOR BOOKS
FAINTLY AS IF IT WERE AN UNUSUAL EXERTION HIS FACE RETURNED INTO ITS LINES OF HABITUAL ANXIETY HE HAD A TRICK OF HALF OPENING HIS MOUTH AS IF TO SPEAK WHICH CONSTANTLY UNSETTLED THE FORM OF THE LIPS
HER MOTHER HAD BEEN DETAINED AT HOME BY A MULTITUDE OF HALF REASONS NONE OF WHICH ANYBODY FULLY UNDERSTOOD EXCEPT MISTER HALE WHO WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT ALL HIS ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF A GREY SATIN GOWN
BUT SURELY IT IS A VERY EASY JOURNEY TO LONDON YES BUT SOMEHOW SAID FANNY LOWERING HER VOICE MAMMA HAS NEVER BEEN TO LONDON HERSELF AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY LONGING
IF MISSUS SHAW HAD GUESSED AT THE REAL REASON WHY MISSUS HALE DID NOT ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWERED DOWN GOWNS UPON HER BUT IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE MISSUS SHAW HAD BEEN THE POOR PRETTY MISS BERESFORD
PSYCHOLOGY AND THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT TWO CONTEMPLATION AND SUGGESTION
PERHAPS IT WAS NOT QUITE A LOGICAL DEDUCTION FROM ALL THESE PREMISES BUT IT WAS STILL MISSUS SHAW'S CHARACTERISTIC CONCLUSION AS SHE THOUGHT OVER HER SISTER'S LOT
FANNY DON'T SPEAK SO OF YOUR BROTHER HE HAS GOOD REASONS OF SOME KIND OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NOT WISH US TO GO MAKE HASTE AND PUT YOUR THINGS ON
WITH WHAT ASKED MISSUS THORNTON HER BROW SLIGHTLY CONTRACTING
AND A FURTHER SECTION SUGGESTS SOME WAYS IN WHICH EDUCATIONISTS MIGHT PROMOTE THE UP SPRINGING OF THIS LIFE IN THE YOUNG FINALLY THE LAST CHAPTER ATTEMPTS TO PLACE THE FACT OF THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT IN ITS RELATION TO THE SOCIAL ORDER
IT WILL DO YOU GOOD INSTEAD OF HARM
NOT SO PLEASANT IN THE LATTER HALF OF SEPTEMBER THE AUTUMNAL RAINS AND STORMS CAME ON AND MARGARET WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN MORE IN THE HOUSE THAN SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE
I WISH I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT FROM AUNT SHAW I ONLY KNEW HE COULD NOT COME BACK TO ENGLAND BECAUSE OF THAT TERRIBLE AFFAIR POOR DEAR PAPA HOW SAD HE LOOKS
HER DEAR FATHER LEANING BACK ASLEEP IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE HIS BLUE BLACK HAIR WAS GREY NOW AND LAY THINLY OVER HIS BROWS THE BONES OF HIS FACE WERE PLAINLY TO BE SEEN
FULL OF DIMPLES AND GLANCES THAT SPOKE OF CHILDISH GLADNESS AND BOUNDLESS HOPE IN THE FUTURE IT WAS THE LATTER PART OF JULY WHEN MARGARET RETURNED HOME THE FOREST TREES WERE ALL ONE DARK FULL DUSKY GREEN
HIS ROOM WAS KEPT EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT IT AND WAS REGULARLY DUSTED AND PUT INTO ORDER BY DIXON MISSUS HALE'S MAID WHO TOUCHED NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK
AND MARGARET WOULD TRY TO TEMPT HER FORTH ON TO THE BEAUTIFUL BROAD UPLAND SUN STREAKED CLOUD SHADOWED COMMON FOR SHE WAS SURE THAT HER MOTHER HAD ACCUSTOMED HERSELF TOO MUCH TO AN IN DOORS LIFE SELDOM EXTENDING HER WALKS BEYOND THE CHURCH
CHAPTER TWELVE MORNING CALLS WELL I SUPPOSE WE MUST FRIENDS IN COUNCIL
RATHER THAN THE ABIDING SUBSTANCE OF SPIRITUALITY READERS OF THESE PAGES WILL FIND NOTHING ABOUT TRANCES ECSTASIES AND OTHER RARE PSYCHIC PHENOMENA WHICH SOMETIMES INDICATE HOLINESS AND SOMETIMES ONLY DISEASE
I AM SO GLAD I AM GOING HOME TO BE AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM AND MAMMA SHE WAS READY WITH A BRIGHT SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF FATIGUE TO GREET HER FATHER WHEN HE AWAKENED HE SMILED BACK AGAIN BUT
HALF CONFIDENTIAL SHAKE OF THE HEAD TO THE PARSON WHO WATCHED HIM AWAY BEYOND THE SWEET BRIAR HEDGE AND PAST THE GREAT ARBUTUS BEFORE HE TURNED INTO THE ROOM TO BEGIN HIS DAY'S WORK WITH ALL THE SIGNS OF A HEAVY HEART
LEARNED AND DELIGHTED IN USING THEIR PECULIAR WORDS TOOK UP HER FREEDOM AMONGST THEM NURSED THEIR BABIES TALKED OR READ WITH SLOW DISTINCTNESS TO THEIR OLD PEOPLE
BUT EVERY DAY HE WAS MORE OVERPOWERED THE WORLD BECAME MORE BEWILDERING AT EACH REPEATED URGENCY OF HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD PUT HIMSELF IN THE WAY OF SEEKING SOME PREFERMENT
A WHITE CHIP BONNET OH DOZENS OF THINGS FOR THE WEDDING AND HUNDREDS OF THINGS FOR THE HOUSE MARGARET ONLY KNEW THAT HER MOTHER HAD NOT FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO COME
NOW THERE WERE ONLY THE WELL BOUND LITTLE READ ENGLISH CLASSICS WHICH WERE WEEDED OUT OF HER FATHER'S LIBRARY TO FILL UP THE SMALL BOOK SHELVES IN THE DRAWING ROOM THOMSON'S SEASONS HAYLEY'S COWPER MIDDLETON'S CICERO
TOO CROWDED THAT IS THE WORST
AND BY RECENT WORK ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF AUTISTIC THOUGHT AND OF SUGGESTION THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE A PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR EVERY MAN WHO DESIRES TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF HIS SOUL
TO FIND THE CAUSE FOR THE LINES THAT SPOKE SO PLAINLY OF HABITUAL DISTRESS AND DEPRESSION POOR FREDERICK THOUGHT SHE SIGHING OH IF FREDERICK HAD BUT BEEN A CLERGYMAN INSTEAD OF GOING INTO THE NAVY AND BEING LOST TO US ALL
MISSUS THORNTON WAS SHY IT WAS ONLY OF LATE YEARS THAT SHE HAD HAD LEISURE ENOUGH IN HER LIFE TO GO INTO SOCIETY AND AS SOCIETY SHE DID NOT ENJOY IT
AS DINNER GIVING AND AS CRITICISING OTHER PEOPLE'S DINNERS SHE TOOK SATISFACTION IN IT BUT THIS GOING TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH STRANGERS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING
WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
MISSUS HALE WAS MAKING RATHER MORE EXERTION IN HER ANSWERS CAPTIVATED BY SOME REAL OLD LACE WHICH MISSUS THORNTON WORE LACE AS SHE AFTERWARDS OBSERVED TO DIXON OF THAT OLD ENGLISH POINT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MADE FOR THIS SEVENTY YEARS AND
AND SHE HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN ALL GRIEVANCES EXCEPT THAT OF THE UNHAPPINESS ARISING FROM DISPARITY OF AGE IN MARRIED LIFE ON WHICH SHE COULD DESCANT BY THE HALF HOUR DEAREST MARIA HAD MARRIED THE MAN OF HER HEART
THIS SHAME I SAY BETRAYED THE WANT OF A SECURE RESTING PLACE FOR HER AFFECTION SHE NEVER CALLED HER SON BY ANY NAME BUT JOHN LOVE AND DEAR AND SUCH LIKE TERMS WERE RESERVED FOR FANNY
AS FANNY HAD PUT IT IT DID SEEM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IMPERTINENTLY DISCUSSING MISSUS THORNTON'S FEELINGS BUT SHE ALSO ROSE UP AGAINST THAT LADY'S MANNER OF SHOWING THAT SHE WAS OFFENDED MISSUS THORNTON WENT ON AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
BUT SO MUCH THE MORE I HAVE TO WATCH OVER YOU NOW AS FOR FANNY THERE A LITTLE HARDSHIP WOULD DO HER GOOD SHE IS NOT MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AS YOU ARE JOHN SHE COULD NOT BEAR IT
SO HE WITHDREW WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE YET YOUNG INTO HIS LIBRARY TO SPEND HIS EVENINGS IF HE WERE AT HOME IN READING THE SPECULATIVE AND METAPHYSICAL BOOKS WHICH WERE HIS DELIGHT
NO CONDITIONS BEING ATTACHED TO THIS APPOINTMENT IT SEEMED A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SO FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MOMENT SOME OF THE IMPLICITS WHICH I BELIEVE TO UNDERLIE HUMAN EFFORT
WAS OF AN IVORY SMOOTHNESS AND DELICACY IF THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS IN GENERAL TOO DIGNIFIED AND RESERVED FOR ONE SO YOUNG NOW TALKING TO HER FATHER IT WAS BRIGHT AS THE MORNING
THEN SHE FELT THAT BY CONCEALING HER UTTER INDIFFERENCE TO ALL SUCH PLACES SHE WAS HARDLY SPEAKING WITH TRUTH SO SHE WENT ON
WHO MIGHT NOW PUT THEMSELVES TO TROUBLE AND EXPENSE IN THEIR TURN YET CRAMPTON WAS TOO FAR OFF FOR HER TO WALK AND SHE HAD REPEATEDLY QUESTIONED HER SON AS TO WHETHER HIS WISH THAT SHE SHOULD CALL ON THE HALES WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR THE EXPENSE OF CAB HIRE
AND HAD DISCOURAGED HER HUSBAND VERY EARLY IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE IN HIS DESIRE OF READING ALOUD TO HER WHILE SHE WORKED AT ONE TIME THEY HAD TRIED BACKGAMMON AS A RESOURCE BUT AS MISTER HALE GREW TO TAKE AN INCREASING INTEREST IN HIS SCHOOL AND HIS PARISHIONERS
EVERY IMPROVEMENT OF MACHINERY IS I BELIEVE TO BE SEEN THERE IN ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T LIKE MILLS AND MANUFACTORIES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS SAID FANNY IN A HALF WHISPER
MISSUS HALE IF SHE SPOKE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED WITH A READY MADE LIST
AND ACHIEVEMENT IN THE DOMAIN OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE THE MATERIAL GATHERED FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS NOW BEEN ADDED TO REVISED AND TO SOME EXTENT RE WRITTEN
SHE WILL DO YOU NO GOOD I SEE THE MOTHER LOOKS VERY ILL AND SEEMS A NICE QUIET KIND OF PERSON
FIFTEEN SHILLINGS A WEEK AND THREE SAVED OUT OF THEM THOUGHT MARGARET TO HERSELF BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY YOUNG SHE PROBABLY HAS FORGOTTEN HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT SHE MUST KNOW OF THOSE DAYS
MAY I INQUIRE MARGARET HAD NOT THE WORDS READY FOR AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WHICH TOOK HER A LITTLE BY SURPRISE SO MISS THORNTON REPLIED
MISTER THORNTON HAD HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN WORKING UP HIS MOTHER TO THE DESIRED POINT OF CIVILITY SHE DID NOT OFTEN MAKE CALLS AND WHEN SHE DID IT WAS IN HEAVY STATE THAT SHE WENT THROUGH HER DUTIES
THIS LIFE AT LEAST THESE WALKS REALISED ALL MARGARET'S ANTICIPATIONS SHE TOOK A PRIDE IN HER FOREST ITS PEOPLE WERE HER PEOPLE SHE MADE HEARTY FRIENDS WITH THEM
THE FULL ACCOUNT OF WHICH MARGARET HAD NEVER HEARD AND WHICH NOW SEEMED DOOMED TO BE BURIED IN SAD OBLIVION
HE WOULD BE DEPRESSED FOR MANY DAYS AFTER WITNESSING A DEATH BED OR HEARING OF ANY CRIME BUT NOW MARGARET NOTICED AN ABSENCE OF MIND AS IF HIS THOUGHTS WERE PRE OCCUPIED BY SOME SUBJECT
ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES MISTER HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
WHICH THE UNEASY TENDERNESS OF MISSUS THORNTON'S MANNER TO HER DAUGHTER THE SHAME WITH WHICH SHE THOUGHT TO HIDE THE POVERTY OF HER CHILD IN ALL THE GRAND QUALITIES WHICH SHE HERSELF POSSESSED UNCONSCIOUSLY AND WHICH SHE SET SO HIGH A VALUE UPON IN OTHERS
THAN THE SERENE CALM OF THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE WHO LED A PLACID CONTENTED LIFE MARGARET WAS PAINFULLY STRUCK BY THE WORN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION AND SHE WENT BACK OVER THE OPEN AND AVOWED CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER FATHER'S LIFE
SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY
CARRIED DAINTY MESSES TO THEIR SICK RESOLVED BEFORE LONG TO TEACH AT THE SCHOOL WHERE HER FATHER WENT EVERY DAY AS TO AN APPOINTED TASK BUT SHE WAS CONTINUALLY TEMPTED OFF TO GO AND SEE SOME INDIVIDUAL FRIEND
AND WITH THE SOFT VIOLENCE OF THE WEST WIND BEHIND HER AS SHE CROSSED SOME HEATH SHE SEEMED TO BE BORNE ONWARDS AS LIGHTLY AND EASILY AS THE FALLEN LEAF THAT WAS WAFTED ALONG BY THE AUTUMNAL BREEZE
MISSUS THORNTON WAS NOT A WOMAN MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING HER QUICK JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION SERVED HER IN GOOD STEAD OF ANY LONG ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH HERSELF SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT NOTHING COULD STRENGTHEN FANNY TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS PATIENTLY
AND THE PROBLEMS SURROUNDING SYMBOLS AND CULTS THESE CHAPTERS LEAD UP TO A DISCUSSION OF THE PERSONAL ASPECT OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE ITS CURVE OF GROWTH CHARACTERS AND ACTIVITIES
MISSUS THORNTON DID NOT SPEAK BUT SHE LAID HER WORK ON THE TABLE AND SEEMED TO THINK IT WILL BE A LONG WAY FOR HER TO WALK BACK AT NIGHT
NO ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOSE ABNORMAL EXPERIENCES AND STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH TOO OFTEN REGARDED AS SPECIALLY MYSTICAL ARE NOW RECOGNIZED BY ALL COMPETENT STUDENTS AS REPRESENTING THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS
HE FOUND THAT THE INTERRUPTIONS WHICH AROSE OUT OF THESE DUTIES WERE REGARDED AS HARDSHIPS BY HIS WIFE NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF HIS PROFESSION BUT TO BE REGRETTED AND STRUGGLED AGAINST BY HER AS THEY SEVERALLY AROSE
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF MILTON MISS HALE HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF OUR FACTORIES OUR MAGNIFICENT WAREHOUSES NO SAID MARGARET I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING OF THAT DESCRIPTION AS YET
TOO PLAINLY FOR BEAUTY IF HIS FEATURES HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT AS IT WAS THEY HAD A GRACE IF NOT A COMELINESS OF THEIR OWN THE FACE WAS IN REPOSE BUT IT WAS RATHER REST AFTER WEARINESS
THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP MANY LUXURIES WHICH HAD ONLY BEEN TROUBLES AND TRAMMELS TO HER FREEDOM IN HARLEY STREET HER KEEN ENJOYMENT OF EVERY SENSUOUS PLEASURE WAS BALANCED FINELY IF NOT OVERBALANCED
ALIAS HER MARRIED LIFE SHE REMAINED WITH HER AND WAS DEVOTED TO HER INTERESTS ALWAYS CONSIDERING HERSELF AS THE GOOD AND PROTECTING FAIRY WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO BAFFLE THE MALIGNANT GIANT MISTER HALE
NO ROSEBUD THAT COULD ONLY OPEN JUST ENOUGH TO LET OUT A YES AND NO AND AN'T PLEASE YOU SIR BUT THE WIDE MOUTH WAS ONE SOFT CURVE OF RICH RED LIPS AND THE SKIN IF NOT WHITE AND FAIR
WITH THE HEALTHY SHAME OF A CHILD SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HER KEENNESS OF SIGHT IN PERCEIVING THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE THERE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER ALWAYS SO KIND AND TENDER TOWARDS HER
BUT ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY LADY BERESFORD AS LADIES MAID TO SIR JOHN'S WARDS THE PRETTY MISS BERESFORDS THE BELLES OF RUTLANDSHIRE
AND WAS WANTED EVERYWHERE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME HER MIND AND BODY ACHED NOW WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF ALL SHE HAD DONE AND SAID WITHIN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS THE FAREWELLS SO HURRIEDLY TAKEN AMONGST ALL THE OTHER GOOD BYES
BUT SHE REFUSED TO LET HIM KEEP HORSES FOR IT THEY WERE HIRED FOR THE SOLEMN OCCASIONS WHEN SHE PAID MORNING OR EVENING VISITS SHE HAD HAD HORSES FOR THREE DAYS NOT A FORTNIGHT BEFORE
WARM GRATITUDE FIRST TO THE PRINCIPAL AND AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE WHO GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY OF DELIVERING THESE CHAPTERS IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND WHOSE UNFAILING SYMPATHY AND KINDNESS SO GREATLY HELPED ME
OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY
WHICH JUSTIFY OR ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THESE EXPERIENCES MAY BE ACCOMMODATED TO THE WORLD VIEW OF THE MODERN MAN AND NEXT THE NATURE OF THAT SPIRITUAL LIFE AS IT APPEARS IN HUMAN HISTORY
WHEN MARGARET HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HER A GREAT BOX OF BOOKS RECOMMENDED BY MASTERS OR GOVERNESS AND HAD FOUND THE SUMMER'S DAY ALL TOO SHORT TO GET THROUGH THE READING SHE HAD TO DO BEFORE HER RETURN TO TOWN
CHAPTER TWO ROSES AND THORNS BY THE SOFT GREEN LIGHT IN THE WOODY GLADE ON THE BANKS OF MOSS WHERE THY CHILDHOOD PLAYED BY THE HOUSEHOLD TREE
AND SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO THINK THAT THEIR MEETING AND GREETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT HELSTONE PARSONAGE RATHER THAN DURING THE CONFUSION OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOUSE IN HARLEY STREET WHERE SHE HERSELF HAD HAD TO PLAY THE PART OF FIGARO
THE SCHOOL AND THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES THIS DID GOOD FOR A TIME BUT WHEN THE AUTUMN DREW ON AND THE WEATHER BECAME MORE CHANGEABLE HER MOTHER'S IDEA OF THE UNHEALTHINESS OF THE PLACE INCREASED
HELSTONE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS OF THEIR OWN STANDARD OF CULTIVATION IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST OUT OF THE WAY PLACES IN ENGLAND SAID MISSUS HALE IN ONE OF HER PLAINTIVE MOODS
BUT HER HEART GAVE THANKS FOR HIM DAY AND NIGHT AND SHE WALKED PROUDLY AMONG WOMEN FOR HIS SAKE FANNY DEAR I SHALL HAVE HORSES TO THE CARRIAGE TO DAY TO GO AND CALL ON THESE HALES
BUT THE LITTLE ALTERCATION BETWEEN HER SON AND HER DAUGHTER DID NOT INCLINE MISSUS THORNTON MORE FAVOURABLY TOWARDS THESE HALES HER JEALOUS HEART REPEATED HER DAUGHTER'S QUESTION
WITH A WISDOM I HAVE SINCE LEARNED TO COMPREHEND THOUGH I REMEMBER IT SHOCKED ME A LITTLE AT THE TIME ALL THIS SET ME THINKING BEFORE THE DRESSING OF LITTLE DAVIE WAS OVER I HAD MY QUESTION TO PUT TO KIRSTY IT WAS IN FACT THE SAME QUESTION
CAME RUNNING IN GREAT DISTRESS TO KIRSTY CRYING FEE FEE BY WHICH HE MEANT TO INDICATE THAT A FLEA WAS RENDERING HIS LIFE MISERABLE
RUBY TURNED AWAY AND BEGAN PULLING AT HIS HAYRACK IN SILENCE DIAMOND GAVE A SHIVER AND LOOKING ROUND SAW THAT THE DOOR OF THE STABLE WAS OPEN
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE OLDER WE GREW THE MORE OUR MINDS WERE ALIENATED FROM HER AND THE MORE WE CAME TO REGARD HER AS OUR ENEMY IF SHE REALLY MEANT TO BE OUR FRIEND AFTER THE BEST FASHION SHE KNEW IT WAS AT LEAST AN UNCOMELY KIND OF FRIENDSHIP
MUST BE RENOUNCED USURPATION MAY REAR ITS CREST IN EACH STATE AND TRAMPLE UPON THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE WHILE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT COULD LEGALLY
NO HARM RETORTED DIAMOND
BECAUSE I WANTED TO GROW FAT YOU GREASE TUB OH MY TEETH AND TAIL I THOUGHT YOU WERE A HUMBUG WHY DID YOU WANT TO GET FAT THERE'S NO TRUTH TO BE GOT OUT OF YOU BUT BY CROSS QUESTIONING YOU AIN'T FIT TO BE A HORSE BECAUSE
KEEP OUT OF MY WAY YOU UNWORTHY WRETCH OR I'LL BITE YOU YOU A HORSE
BUT THERE'S YOUNG DIAMOND LISTENING TO ALL WE'RE SAYING AND HE KNOWS WELL ENOUGH THERE ARE HORSES IN HEAVEN FOR ANGELS TO RIDE UPON AS WELL AS OTHER ANIMALS LIONS AND EAGLES AND BULLS IN MORE IMPORTANT SITUATIONS
PROPER FOR SUCH IMPOSITIONS IF INEQUALITIES SHOULD ARISE IN SOME STATES FROM DUTIES ON PARTICULAR OBJECTS THESE WILL IN ALL PROBABILITY
THE NATURAL CURE FOR AN ILL ADMINISTRATION IN A POPULAR OR REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION IS A CHANGE OF MEN A GUARANTY BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY WOULD BE AS MUCH LEVELLED AGAINST THE USURPATIONS OF RULERS AS AGAINST THE FERMENTS AND OUTRAGES OF FACTION AND SEDITION IN THE COMMUNITY
AM I AWAKE OR AM I ASLEEP BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR THERE WAS NORTH WIND CALLING HIM
OR OF CONTRAVENING OR EXPLAINING AWAY A PROVISION WHICH HAS BEEN OF LATE A REPEATED THEME OF THE EULOGIES OF THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE NEW CONSTITUTION AND THE WANT OF WHICH IN THAT PLAN HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH PLAUSIBLE ANIMADVERSION AND SEVERE CRITICISM
CHAPTER FOUR KIRSTY MY FATHER HAD A HOUSEKEEPER A TRUSTY WOMAN HE CONSIDERED HER WE THOUGHT HER VERY OLD I SUPPOSE SHE WAS ABOUT FORTY SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT FOR SHE WAS GRIM FACED AND CENSORIOUS
IT WILL APPEAR FROM THE SPECIMENS WHICH HAVE BEEN CITED THAT THE AMERICAN CONFEDERACY IN THIS PARTICULAR STANDS DISCRIMINATED FROM EVERY OTHER INSTITUTION OF A SIMILAR KIND AND EXHIBITS A NEW AND UNEXAMPLED PHENOMENON IN THE POLITICAL WORLD
AFTER DOING EVERYTHING THAT FELL TO HIS SHARE THE BOY HAD A WEALTH OF TIME AT HIS DISPOSAL AND A HAPPY SOMETIMES A MERRY TIME IT WAS
I SHALL NOW PROCEED IN THE ENUMERATION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THOSE DEFECTS WHICH HAVE HITHERTO DISAPPOINTED OUR HOPES FROM THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED AMONG OURSELVES TO FORM A SAFE AND SATISFACTORY JUDGMENT OF THE PROPER REMEDY IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
WITH A VERY STRAIGHT BACK AND A VERY LONG UPPER LIP INDEED THE DISTANCE FROM HER NOSE TO HER MOUTH WAS GREATER THAN THE LENGTH OF HER NOSE WHEN I THINK OF HER FIRST IT IS ALWAYS AS MAKING SOME COMPLAINT TO MY FATHER AGAINST US
BUT KIRSTY HAD COME FROM A REGION WHERE THE HILLS WERE HILLS INDEED HILLS WITH MIGHTY SKELETONS OF STONE INSIDE THEM
THERE I'VE DONE I'M GOING TO SLEEP I'LL TRY TO THINK AS WELL OF YOU AS I CAN IF YOU WOULD BUT STEP OUT A BIT AND RUN OFF A LITTLE OF YOUR FAT HERE DIAMOND BEGAN TO DOUBLE UP HIS KNEES BUT RUBY SPOKE AGAIN AND AS YOUNG DIAMOND THOUGHT
HOLD YOUR TONGUE OR I'LL BREAK MY HALTER AND BE AT YOU WITH YOUR HANDSOME FAT NEVER MIND DIAMOND YOU'RE A GOOD HORSE YOU CAN'T HURT ME CAN'T HURT YOU JUST LET ME ONCE TRY NO YOU CAN'T WHY THEN
IN ALL SITUATIONS A FORMIDABLE OBJECTION IN A BRANCH OF TAXATION WHERE NO LIMITS TO THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE NATURE OF THINGS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FIXED RULE NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE END
BY BEING CROSS WITH THEM THIS COMES OF NOT HAVING FAITH ENOUGH IN GOD AND SHOWS HOW NECESSARY THIS FAITH IS FOR WHEN WE LOSE IT WE LOSE EVEN THE KINDNESS WHICH ALONE CAN SOOTHE THE SUFFERING
HE ASKED I'M ALWAYS WANTING SOMETHING SIR ANSWERED DIAMOND WELL THAT'S QUITE RIGHT SO LONG AS WHAT YOU WANT IS RIGHT EVERYBODY IS ALWAYS WANTING SOMETHING ONLY WE DON'T MENTION IT
BETTER BUT FALL ASLEEP BETWEEN EVERY STEP YOU'LL RUN A GOOD CHANCE OF LAMING ALL YOUR ANKLES AS YOU CALL THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER IT'S NOT YOUR LIVELY HORSE THAT COMES TO GRIEF IN THAT WAY
WOULD TURN AGAIN TO HIS BOOK OR HIS SERMON SAYING VERY WELL MISSUS MITCHELL
A GREAT PUFF OF WIND CAME AGAINST HIM AND IN OBEDIENCE TO IT HE TURNED HIS BACK AND WENT AS IT BLEW
I KNOW HE CAN SHINE BOOTS SIR SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR US
HE PICKED IT UP AND RAN BACK AND OPENED THE STABLE DOOR AND WENT IN
MAY SERVE AS A STANDARD THE STATE OF AGRICULTURE AND THE POPULOUSNESS OF A COUNTRY HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS NEARLY CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER AND AS A RULE FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED NUMBERS IN THE VIEW OF SIMPLICITY AND CERTAINTY ARE ENTITLED TO A PREFERENCE
WE CANNOT DENY THAT HE MADE MISSUS MITCHELL TOO IT IS VERY PUZZLING I CONFESS I REMEMBER ONCE THAT MY YOUNGEST BROTHER DAVIE A VERY LITTLE FELLOW THEN FOR HE COULD NOT SPEAK PLAINLY
A BOY LIKE THAT HE SAID OUGHT NOT TO BE PUSHED JOSEPH ASSENTED HEARTILY
IN A RATHER DIFFERENT TONE I SAY DIAMOND I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE AN HONEST OLD HORSE LIKE YOU THINK OF ME LIKE THAT I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH IT WAS MY OWN FAULT THAT I FELL LAME I TOLD YOU SO RETURNED THE OTHER
TILL SOME TIME AFTER SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS TOO SHY TO GO AND INQUIRE ABOUT HER BUT WHEN AT LENGTH SHE WENT TO LIVE WITH DIAMOND'S FAMILY
ANKLE INDEED WHY SHOULD YOU APE YOUR BETTERS HORSES AIN'T GOT ANY ANKLES
WELL I DON'T GRUDGE YOURS WHAT HE GETS BY ME SAID RUBY GETS RETORTED DIAMOND WHAT HE GETS ISN'T WORTH GRUDGING IT COMES TO NEXT TO NOTHING WHAT WITH YOUR FAT AND SHINE
THE GENIUS OF THE CITIZENS THE DEGREE OF INFORMATION THEY POSSESS THE STATE OF COMMERCE OF ARTS OF INDUSTRY THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MANY MORE TOO COMPLEX MINUTE OR ADVENTITIOUS TO ADMIT OF A PARTICULAR SPECIFICATION
FOR MISTER RAYMOND WAS AN OLD BACHELOR NO LONGER HE WAS BRINGING HIS WIFE WITH HIM TO LIVE AT THE MOUND THE MOMENT NANNY SAW HER SHE RECOGNISED HER AS THE LADY WHO HAD LENT HER THE RUBY RING THAT RING HAD BEEN GIVEN HER BY MISTER RAYMOND
BEFORE SHE LAID OUT ANYTHING EVEN ON FOOD HIS FATHER HAD BEEN VERY GLOOMY SO GLOOMY THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN CROSS TO HIS WIFE IT IS A STRANGE THING HOW PAIN OF SEEING THE SUFFERING OF THOSE WE LOVE WILL SOMETIMES MAKE US ADD TO THEIR SUFFERING
DIAMOND IN CONSEQUENCE HAD GONE TO BED VERY QUIET AND THOUGHTFUL A LITTLE TROUBLED INDEED IT HAD BEEN A VERY STORMY WINTER
IT'S MY BELIEF ONCE OUT THEY'D STICK OUT FOR EVER TALK OF KICKING WHY DON'T YOU PUT ONE FOOT BEFORE THE OTHER NOW AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE IN THE CAB THE ABUSE MASTER GETS FOR YOUR SAKE IS QUITE SHAMEFUL NO DECENT HORSE WOULD BRING IT ON HIM
WHERE THE WHOLE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT IS IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE
A LITTLE LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE DUSTY WINDOW FROM A GAS LAMP SUFFICIENT TO SHOW HIM DIAMOND AND RUBY WITH THEIR TWO HEADS UP
HE JUMPED OUT OF BED AND LOOKED EVERYWHERE BUT COULD NOT SEE HER DIAMOND COME HERE SHE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT WHERE THE HERE WAS HE COULD NOT TELL TO BE SURE THE ROOM WAS ALL BUT QUITE DARK
THE INORDINATE PRIDE OF STATE IMPORTANCE HAS SUGGESTED TO SOME MINDS AN OBJECTION TO THE PRINCIPLE OF A GUARANTY IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
THE SAYING IS AS JUST AS IT IS WITTY THAT IN POLITICAL ARITHMETIC TWO AND TWO DO NOT ALWAYS MAKE FOUR IF DUTIES ARE TOO HIGH THEY LESSEN THE CONSUMPTION THE COLLECTION IS ELUDED
MY IMPRESSION IS THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE HALF SHE TOLD HIM AT ALL EVENTS
BY THEIR VERY NATURE BE ABOUT SOMETHING AMISS I HAVE OCCASIONALLY WONDERED HOW SHE WOULD HAVE BEHAVED TO A GIRL ON REFLECTION I THINK A LITTLE BETTER BUT THE GIRL WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE OFF BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED FROM HER AS WE DID
THE NORTH WIND OFTEN BLEW WHEN DIAMOND WENT TO HIS BED WHICH WAS IN A TINY ROOM IN THE ROOF HE HEARD IT LIKE THE SEA MOANING AND WHEN HE FELL ASLEEP HE STILL HEARD THE MOANING ALL AT ONCE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THEY DON'T TALK HORSE SLANG UP THERE AND IT HURT ME VERY MUCH I ASSURE YOU DIAMOND THOUGH YOU MAYN'T BE GOOD ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO BELIEVE IT OLD DIAMOND MADE NO REPLY HE HAD LAIN DOWN AGAIN AND A SLEEPY SNORT VERY LIKE A SNORE
HAS BEEN ALREADY POINTED OUT AND HAS SUFFICIENTLY APPEARED FROM THE TRIAL WHICH HAS BEEN MADE OF IT I SPEAK OF IT NOW SOLELY WITH A VIEW TO EQUALITY AMONG THE STATES
IF WE ARE UNWILLING TO IMPAIR THE FORCE OF THIS APPLAUDED PROVISION WE SHALL BE OBLIGED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE UNITED STATES AFFORD THE EXTRAORDINARY SPECTACLE OF A GOVERNMENT DESTITUTE EVEN OF THE SHADOW OF CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO ENFORCE THE EXECUTION OF ITS OWN LAWS
WHICH WERE EVER TRYING TO GET UP A COUNTRY WHERE EVERY CLIFF AND ROCK AND WELL HAD ITS STORY
UPON A PRINCIPLE WHICH DISTRIBUTES THE PUBLIC BURDENS WITH SO UNEQUAL A HAND AND WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO IMPOVERISH AND OPPRESS THE CITIZENS OF SOME STATES WHILE THOSE OF OTHERS WOULD SCARCELY BE CONSCIOUS OF THE SMALL PROPORTION OF THE WEIGHT THEY WERE REQUIRED TO SUSTAIN
THE ATTEMPT THEREFORE TO REGULATE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE MEMBERS OF A CONFEDERACY BY ANY SUCH RULE CANNOT FAIL TO BE PRODUCTIVE OF GLARING INEQUALITY AND EXTREME OPPRESSION THIS INEQUALITY WOULD OF ITSELF
WHETHER SHE WAS NICE LOOKING OR NOT
SAID NOT IN A QUESTIONING BUT IN A CONCLUDING TONE GOD DIDN'T MAKE THE FEES KIRSTY OH YES DAVIE GOD MADE EVERYTHING GOD DID MAKE THE FLEAS SAID KIRSTY DAVIE WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE
FOR I WAS ALWAYS RATHER DELICATE AND IF I TOOK A DISLIKE TO ANYTHING WOULD RATHER GO WITHOUT THAN EAT OR DRINK OF IT BUT I HAVE TOLD YOU ENOUGH ABOUT HER TO MAKE IT PLAIN THAT SHE COULD BE NO FAVOURITE WITH US
IT WAS SHE WHO GAVE US SOMETHING TO EAT AS OFTEN AND AS MUCH AS WE WANTED
HE SHOT HIS HEAD OVER THE PARTITION AND LOOKING DOWN AT HIM SAID YOU JUST WAIT TILL TO MORROW AND YOU'LL SEE WHETHER I'M SPEAKING THE TRUTH OR NOT I DECLARE THE OLD HORSE IS FAST ASLEEP DIAMOND NO I WON'T
HE DOESN'T DO IT FOR MY SAKE IF I WERE HIS OWN HORSE HE WOULD WORK ME AS HARD AS HE DOES YOU AND I'M PROUD TO BE SO WORKED I WOULDN'T BE AS FAT AS YOU NOT FOR ALL YOU'RE WORTH
HAVE NO POWERS TO EXACT OBEDIENCE OR PUNISH DISOBEDIENCE TO THEIR RESOLUTIONS EITHER BY PECUNIARY MULCTS
SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE GOT IT INTO OUR HEADS THAT THE SHORTNESS OF HER TEMPER WAS MYSTERIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORTNESS OF HER NOSE SHE WAS SAVING EVEN TO STINGINESS SHE WOULD DO HER BEST TO PROVIDE WHAT MY FATHER LIKED
INDEED THEY ARE WELL YOU SEE DIAMOND I DON'T WANT TO GO LAME AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE YOU WERE SO VERY LAME AFTER ALL THERE OH BUT I WAS
REVEALED THAT IF HE WAS NOT ALREADY ASLEEP HE WAS PAST UNDERSTANDING A WORD THAT RUBY WAS SAYING WHEN YOUNG DIAMOND FOUND THIS HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT VENTURE TO TAKE UP THE DROPT SHUTTLECOCK OF THE CONVERSATION I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE IT RUBY
OR BY ANY OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL MODE THERE IS NO EXPRESS DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO THEM TO USE FORCE AGAINST DELINQUENT MEMBERS
THE WANT OF A MUTUAL GUARANTY OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS IS ANOTHER CAPITAL IMPERFECTION IN THE FEDERAL PLAN THERE IS NOTHING OF THIS KIND DECLARED IN THE ARTICLES THAT COMPOSE IT
WHERE THEY FOUND A CART WAITING TO CARRY THEM AND THEIR LUGGAGE TO THE MOUND WHICH WAS THE NAME OF MISTER RAYMOND'S NEW RESIDENCE I WILL NOT DESCRIBE THE VARIED FEELINGS OF THE PARTY AS THEY WENT OR WHEN THEY ARRIVED ALL I WILL SAY IS THAT DIAMOND WHO IS MY ONLY CARE WAS FULL OF QUIET DELIGHT
BUT SHE WOULD PUT A SKIN OVER IT AFTER HER OWN FASHION
BY WHICH IT IS DECLARED THAT EACH STATE SHALL RETAIN EVERY POWER JURISDICTION AND RIGHT
AND UPON A CERTAIN DAY JOSEPH TOOK HIS WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN AND NANNY AND JIM
WHICH PRODUCE AND CONSTITUTE NATIONAL WEALTH MUST BE SATISFIED THAT THERE IS NO COMMON STANDARD OR BAROMETER BY WHICH THE DEGREES OF IT CAN BE ASCERTAINED
AND SHE MIGHT BE CLOSE BESIDE HIM DEAR NORTH WIND SAID DIAMOND I WANT SO MUCH TO GO TO YOU BUT I CAN'T TELL WHERE COME HERE DIAMOND WAS ALL HER ANSWER
SAID OLD DIAMOND YOU ARE SO PLUMP AND YOUR SKIN SHINES SO YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF THERE'S NO HARM IN BEING FAT SAID RUBY IN A DEPRECATING TONE NO NOR IN BEING SLEEK I MAY AS WELL SHINE AS NOT
EVERY POSSIBLE PRIVILEGE IN THEIR NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES I MEANT TO DO IT DIAMOND AT THE WORDS THE OLD HORSE AROSE WITH A SCRAMBLE LIKE THUNDER SHOT HIS ANGRY HEAD AND GLARING EYE OVER INTO RUBY'S STALL AND SAID
THIS RIGHT WOULD REMAIN UNDIMINISHED
THERE YOU ARE WITH YOUR HUGE CARCASS CRUSHING DOWN YOUR POOR LEGS ALL NIGHT LONG YOU DON'T EVEN CARE FOR YOUR OWN LEGS SO LONG AS YOU CAN EAT EAT AND SLEEP SLEEP YOU A HORSE INDEED BUT I TELL YOU I WAS LAME
ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO SING THESE WERE VERY DIFFERENT TIMES FROM THOSE WHEN HE USED TO DRIVE THE CAB BUT YOU MUST NOT SUPPOSE THAT DIAMOND WAS IDLE HE DID NOT DO SO MUCH FOR HIS MOTHER NOW BECAUSE NANNY OCCUPIED HIS FORMER PLACE
HAVING MANY BLEAK MOORLAND HILLS THAT LAY ABOUT LIKE SLOW STIFFENED WAVES OF NO GREAT HEIGHT BUT OF MUCH DESOLATION AND AS FAR AS THE IMAGINATION WAS CONCERNED IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE MINDS OF FORMER GENERATIONS HAD BEEN AS BLEAK AS THE COUNTRY
HE WOULD ASK OUR VERSION OF THE AFFAIR AND LISTEN TO THAT AS HE HAD LISTENED TO HERS THEN HE WOULD SET FORTH TO US WHERE WE HAD BEEN WRONG IF WE WERE WRONG AND SEND US AWAY WITH AN INJUNCTION NOT TO PROVOKE MISSUS MITCHELL WHO COULDN'T HELP BEING SHORT IN HER TEMPER POOR THING
WILL IN A DEGREE BE AT HIS OWN OPTION AND CAN BE REGULATED BY AN ATTENTION TO HIS RESOURCES THE RICH MAY BE EXTRAVAGANT THE POOR CAN BE FRUGAL AND PRIVATE OPPRESSION MAY ALWAYS BE AVOIDED BY A JUDICIOUS SELECTION OF OBJECTS
YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO THE STABLE LOOK AT THE HORSE NEXT YOU HE'S SOMETHING LIKE A HORSE ALL SKIN AND BONE AND HIS MASTER AIN'T OVER KIND TO HIM EITHER HE PUT A STINGING LASH ON HIS WHIP LAST WEEK BUT THAT OLD HORSE KNOWS HE'S GOT THE WIFE AND CHILDREN TO KEEP
AND ENOUGH LIKEWISE TO SERVE AS A BACKGROUND TO MY DESCRIPTION OF KIRSTY KIRSTY WAS A HIGHLAND WOMAN WHO HAD THE CHARGE OF THE HOUSE IN WHICH THE FARM SERVANTS LIVED SHE WAS A CHEERFUL GRACIOUS KIND WOMAN A WOMAN OF GOD'S MAKING ONE WOULD SAY
WELL AT LEAST YOU OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL YOU'RE THE BETTER FOR IT YOU GET A TWO HOURS REST A DAY OUT OF IT I THANK MY MASTER FOR THAT NOT YOU YOU LAZY FELLOW
DEPEND UPON IT RUBY NO CABMAN LIKES TO BE ABUSED ANY MORE THAN HIS FARE
BUT HE HELPED HIS FATHER STILL BOTH IN THE STABLE AND THE HARNESS ROOM AND GENERALLY WENT WITH HIM ON THE BOX THAT HE MIGHT LEARN TO DRIVE A PAIR AND BE READY TO OPEN THE CARRIAGE DOOR MISTER RAYMOND ADVISED HIS FATHER TO GIVE HIM PLENTY OF LIBERTY
DURING WHICH THEY HAD BEEN TALKING OF HER NEW PROSPECTS THAT NANNY EXPRESSED TO DIAMOND HER OPINION OF THE COUNTRY THERE AIN'T NOTHING IN IT BUT THE SUN AND MOON DIAMOND THERE'S TREES AND FLOWERS SAID DIAMOND
THEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SPAKE LIKE A DISCONTENTED PROPHET OF OLD WHY DOESN'T HE GIVE THEM SOMETHING ELSE TO EAT THEN
OTHER DEFECTS OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HAMILTON
HE HEARD THE TWO HORSES TALKING TO EACH OTHER IN A STRANGE LANGUAGE WHICH YET SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE COULD UNDERSTAND AND TURN OVER IN HIS MIND IN ENGLISH THE FIRST WORDS HE HEARD WERE FROM DIAMOND WHO APPARENTLY HAD BEEN ALREADY QUARRELLING WITH RUBY
THAT THEY CONTAIN IN THEIR OWN NATURE A SECURITY AGAINST EXCESS THEY PRESCRIBE THEIR OWN LIMIT WHICH CANNOT BE EXCEEDED WITHOUT DEFEATING THE END PROPOSED THAT IS AN EXTENSION OF THE REVENUE WHEN APPLIED TO THIS OBJECT
BUT THE DOOR IS LOCKED HE KNEW WHERE THE KEY WAS IN A CERTAIN HOLE IN THE WALL FAR TOO HIGH FOR HIM TO GET AT HE RAN TO THE PLACE HOWEVER
WHAT IS IT NOW THERE'S A FRIEND OF NANNY'S A LAME BOY CALLED JIM I'VE HEARD OF HIM SAID MISTER RAYMOND WELL NANNY DOESN'T CARE MUCH ABOUT GOING TO THE COUNTRY SIR
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK HAVING IN THE THREE LAST NUMBERS TAKEN A SUMMARY REVIEW OF THE PRINCIPAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVENTS WHICH HAVE DEPICTED THE GENIUS AND FATE OF OTHER CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENTS
MY FATHER WOULD HEAR HER COMPLAINTS TO THE END WITHOUT PUTTING IN A WORD EXCEPT IT WERE TO ASK HER A QUESTION
THE WEATHER WAS VERY HOT AND THE WOODS VERY SHADOWY THERE WERE NOT A GREAT MANY WILD FLOWERS
DIAMOND OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AND DOWN THE STAIR AND INTO THE YARD HIS LITTLE HEART WAS IN A FLUTTER FOR HE HAD LONG GIVEN UP ALL THOUGHT OF SEEING HER AGAIN NEITHER NOW WAS HE TO SEE HER WHEN HE GOT OUT
A SUCCESSFUL FACTION MAY ERECT A TYRANNY ON THE RUINS OF ORDER AND LAW WHILE NO SUCCOR COULD CONSTITUTIONALLY BE AFFORDED BY THE UNION TO THE FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE GOVERNMENT
HE SAID BUT RUBY NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD OR TOOK ANY NOTICE OF HIM I SUPPOSE HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND MORE OF ENGLISH THAN JUST WHAT THE COACHMAN AND STABLEMAN WERE IN THE HABIT OF ADDRESSING HIM WITH FINDING HOWEVER THAT HIS COMPANION MADE NO REPLY
AND HE WORKS LIKE A HORSE I DARESAY HE GRUDGES HIS MASTER THE BEER HE DRINKS
IN A COUNTRY IMPERFECTLY SETTLED AND PROGRESSIVE IN IMPROVEMENT
THEY WOULD NEITHER BE SO GREAT IN THEIR DEGREE SO UNIFORM IN THEIR OPERATION NOR SO ODIOUS IN THEIR APPEARANCE AS THOSE WHICH WOULD NECESSARILY SPRING FROM QUOTAS UPON ANY SCALE THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE DEVISED
AND EVERYTHING READY FOR MIGRATING AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE
YOU GO ALONG LIKE A BUTTOCK OF BEEF UPON CASTORS YOU DO AIN'T YOU AFRAID I'LL KICK IF YOU GO ON LIKE THAT DIAMOND
AND DIAMOND'S CHIEF PLEASURE SEEMED TO BE TO LIE AMONGST THEM AND BREATHE THE PURE AIR BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS DREAMING OF THE COUNTRY AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND AND TRYING TO RECALL THE SONGS THE RIVER USED TO SING FOR THIS WAS MORE LIKE BEING AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT TO BE A BOY WAS IN HER EYES TO BE SOMETHING WRONG TO BEGIN WITH
IS ANOTHER FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN THE CONFEDERATION
AND AS I HEAR GET ALONG NO FASTER THAN A BIG DRAY HORSE WITH TWO TONS BEHIND HIM SO THEY TELL ME YOUR MASTER'S NOT MINE SAID RUBY I MUST ATTEND TO MY OWN MASTER'S INTERESTS AND EAT ALL THAT IS GIVEN ME
HIS OPINION OF HIM WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM NANNY'S
AND THE MOST OF THE WILD FLOWERS RISE EARLY TO BE BEFORE THE LEAVES BECAUSE IF THEY DID NOT
WHICH SHE CLAIMED FOR ALL HIGHLAND FOLK A LIGHT STEP A SWEET VOICE AND A MOST BOUNTEOUS HAND BUT THERE I COME INTO THE MORAL NATURE OF HER
THAT SHOWED ITSELF IN CONSTANT OPPOSITION FAULT FINDING AND COMPLAINT THE REAL MISTAKE WAS THAT WE WERE BOYS THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER ALTOGETHER ANTAGONISTIC TO THE BOY NATURE
THAT THE ACTIVE WEALTH OF KING'S COUNTY BEARS A MUCH GREATER PROPORTION TO THAT OF MONTGOMERY THAN IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE IF WE SHOULD TAKE EITHER THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE LANDS OR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE AS A CRITERION THE WEALTH OF NATIONS DEPENDS UPON AN INFINITE VARIETY OF CAUSES
THE CONSEQUENCE CLEARLY IS THAT THERE CAN BE NO COMMON MEASURE OF NATIONAL WEALTH AND OF COURSE NO GENERAL OR STATIONARY RULE BY WHICH THE ABILITY OF A STATE TO PAY TAXES CAN BE DETERMINED
PEOPLE'S KIND TO LAME BOYS YOU KNOW SIR BUT AFTER DARK THERE AIN'T SO MUCH DOING DIAMOND SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING JIM TO MISTER RAYMOND AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT HE RESOLVED TO GIVE THE BOY A CHANCE HE PROVIDED NEW CLOTHES FOR BOTH HIM AND NANNY
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO DIAMOND AND RUBY IT WAS FRIDAY NIGHT AND DIAMOND LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSEHOLD HAD HAD VERY LITTLE TO EAT THAT DAY THE MOTHER WOULD ALWAYS PAY THE WEEK'S RENT
THEY THINK I'M SILLY ADDED DIAMOND WITH ONE OF HIS SWEETEST SMILES WHAT MISTER RAYMOND THOUGHT I DARE HARDLY ATTEMPT TO PUT DOWN HERE
BUT FOR US SHE THOUGHT ALMOST ANYTHING GOOD ENOUGH SHE WOULD FOR INSTANCE GIVE US THE THINNEST OF MILK WE SAID SHE SKIMMED IT THREE TIMES BEFORE SHE THOUGHT IT BLUE ENOUGH FOR US MY TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS DID NOT MIND IT SO MUCH AS I DID
AS FOR NANNY SHE HAD BEEN SO HAPPY EVER SINCE SHE LEFT THE HOSPITAL
MAY BE ATTENDED WITH FEWER INCONVENIENCES THAN TO LEAVE THAT DISCRETION ALTOGETHER AT LARGE
IN THE COURSE OF TIME AND THINGS AN EQUILIBRIUM AS FAR AS IT IS ATTAINABLE IN SO COMPLICATED A SUBJECT WILL BE ESTABLISHED EVERYWHERE
ONCE I AM FAT MY NATURE IS TO KEEP FAT FOR A LONG TIME AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN MASTER MIGHT COME HOME AND WANT TO SEE ME YOU CONCEITED GOOD FOR NOTHING BRUTE YOU'RE ONLY FIT FOR THE KNACKER'S YARD YOU WANTED TO LOOK HANDSOME DID YOU
IN EVERY COUNTRY IT IS A HERCULEAN TASK
THIS FORMS A COMPLETE BARRIER AGAINST ANY MATERIAL OPPRESSION OF THE CITIZENS BY TAXES OF THIS CLASS AND IS ITSELF A NATURAL LIMITATION OF THE POWER OF IMPOSING THEM IMPOSITIONS OF THIS KIND USUALLY FALL UNDER THE DENOMINATION OF INDIRECT TAXES
FOR HER FACE I THINK THAT WAS RATHER QUEER
SAID MISTER RAYMOND I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU
YOU MAKE ME ASHAMED OF BEING A HORSE YOU DARE TO SAY MY MASTER AIN'T YOUR MASTER THAT'S YOUR GRATITUDE FOR THE WAY HE FEEDS YOU AND SPARES YOU PRAY WHERE WOULD YOUR CARCASS BE IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM
THERE IS DOUBTLESS A STRIKING ABSURDITY IN SUPPOSING THAT A RIGHT OF THIS KIND DOES NOT EXIST
AND WENT ON BLOWING SHE WANTS ME TO GO INTO THE STABLE
AND MUST FOR A LONG TIME CONSTITUTE THE CHIEF PART OF THE REVENUE RAISED IN THIS COUNTRY THOSE OF THE DIRECT KIND WHICH PRINCIPALLY RELATE TO LAND AND BUILDINGS MAY ADMIT OF A RULE OF APPORTIONMENT EITHER THE VALUE OF LAND
BEFORE THE END OF THE MONTH RUBY HAD GOT RESPECTABLY THIN AND DIAMOND RESPECTABLY STOUT THEY REALLY BEGAN TO LOOK FIT FOR DOUBLE HARNESS JOSEPH AND HIS WIFE GOT THEIR AFFAIRS IN ORDER
OH SHE'S NOT A BAD SORT SAID KIRSTY THOUGH I MUST SAY IF I WAS HER I WOULD TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE AGREEABLE TO RETURN TO KIRSTY SHE WAS OUR CONSTANT RESORT
AND BE SLEEK AND FAT AS I CAN AND GO NO FASTER THAN I NEED NOW REALLY IF THE REST OF THE HORSES WEREN'T ALL ASLEEP POOR THINGS THEY WORK TILL THEY'RE TIRED
JOSEPH YOUR MASTER SHOULD GROW LEAN I COULD HAVE PRETENDED TO BE LAME BUT THAT NO HORSE LEAST OF ALL AN ANGEL HORSE WOULD DO SO I MUST BE LAME AND SO I SPRAINED MY ANKLE FOR THE ANGEL HORSES HAVE ANKLES
PERHAPS SHE MEANT TO SPEAK THE TRUTH OR RATHER PERHAPS TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT SHE ALWAYS DID SPEAK THE TRUTH BUT CERTAINLY SHE WOULD EXAGGERATE THINGS AND GIVE THEM QUITE ANOTHER LOOK THE BONES OF HER STORY MIGHT BE TRUE
WHAT A POOR PITIFUL FIGURE WILL AMERICA MAKE IN THEIR EYES HOW LIABLE WOULD SHE BECOME NOT ONLY TO THEIR CONTEMPT BUT TO THEIR OUTRAGE AND HOW SOON WOULD DEAR BOUGHT EXPERIENCE PROCLAIM
OR WHY IS IT SUGGESTED THAT THREE OR FOUR CONFEDERACIES WOULD BE BETTER THAN ONE I AM PERSUADED IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT RIGHT ON THIS SUBJECT AND THAT THEIR UNIVERSAL AND UNIFORM ATTACHMENT TO THE CAUSE OF THE UNION
OR SPLIT INTO THREE OR FOUR INDEPENDENT AND PROBABLY DISCORDANT REPUBLICS OR CONFEDERACIES ONE INCLINING TO BRITAIN ANOTHER TO FRANCE AND A THIRD TO SPAIN AND PERHAPS PLAYED OFF AGAINST EACH OTHER BY THE THREE
WHICH IN ITS CONSEQUENCES MUST PROVE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THAT EVER ENGAGED THEIR ATTENTION THE PROPRIETY OF THEIR TAKING A VERY COMPREHENSIVE AS WELL AS A VERY SERIOUS VIEW OF IT WILL BE EVIDENT
HAVE INVARIABLY JOINED WITH THE PEOPLE IN THINKING THAT THE PROSPERITY OF AMERICA DEPENDED ON ITS UNION TO PRESERVE AND PERPETUATE IT WAS THE GREAT OBJECT OF THE PEOPLE IN FORMING THAT CONVENTION
AND THAT WHENEVER SUCH INDUCEMENTS MAY FIND FIT TIME AND OPPORTUNITY FOR OPERATION PRETENSES TO COLOR AND JUSTIFY THEM WILL NOT BE WANTING WISELY THEREFORE DO THEY CONSIDER UNION AND A GOOD NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
WHICH IS MORE COMMONLY THE FAULT OF THE HEAD THAN OF THE HEART WILL BE REPRESENTED AS MERE PRETENSE AND ARTIFICE THE STALE BAIT FOR POPULARITY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC GOOD IT WILL BE FORGOTTEN ON THE ONE HAND THAT JEALOUSY IS THE USUAL CONCOMITANT OF LOVE
CHARACTERIZED POLITICAL PARTIES FOR IN POLITICS AS IN RELIGION IT IS EQUALLY ABSURD TO AIM AT MAKING PROSELYTES BY FIRE AND SWORD HERESIES IN EITHER CAN RARELY BE CURED BY PERSECUTION AND YET
IT MAY PERHAPS BE THOUGHT SUPERFLUOUS TO OFFER ARGUMENTS TO PROVE THE UTILITY OF THE UNION A POINT NO DOUBT DEEPLY ENGRAVED ON THE HEARTS OF THE GREAT BODY OF THE PEOPLE IN EVERY STATE AND ONE WHICH IT MAY BE IMAGINED
ARE INFLUENCED BY PURER PRINCIPLES THAN THEIR ANTAGONISTS AMBITION AVARICE PERSONAL ANIMOSITY PARTY OPPOSITION AND MANY OTHER MOTIVES NOT MORE LAUDABLE THAN THESE
I AM WELL AWARE THAT IT WOULD BE DISINGENUOUS TO RESOLVE INDISCRIMINATELY THE OPPOSITION OF ANY SET OF MEN MERELY BECAUSE THEIR SITUATIONS MIGHT SUBJECT THEM TO SUSPICION INTO INTERESTED OR AMBITIOUS VIEWS CANDOR WILL OBLIGE US TO ADMIT
BECAUSE THE CHEAPNESS AND EXCELLENCE OF OUR PRODUCTIONS ADDED TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF VICINITY AND THE ENTERPRISE AND ADDRESS OF OUR MERCHANTS AND NAVIGATORS WILL GIVE US A GREATER SHARE IN THE ADVANTAGES WHICH THOSE TERRITORIES AFFORD
OF THE POWER EMOLUMENT AND CONSEQUENCE OF THE OFFICES THEY HOLD UNDER THE STATE ESTABLISHMENTS AND THE PERVERTED AMBITION OF ANOTHER CLASS OF MEN WHO WILL EITHER HOPE TO AGGRANDIZE THEMSELVES BY THE CONFUSIONS OF THEIR COUNTRY
VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES AND INCONVENIENCES WOULD BE INSEPARABLE FROM SUCH A SITUATION WHEREAS ONE GOVERNMENT WATCHING OVER THE GENERAL AND COMMON INTERESTS AND COMBINING AND DIRECTING THE POWERS AND RESOURCES OF THE WHOLE
PROVIDENCE HAS IN A PARTICULAR MANNER BLESSED IT WITH A VARIETY OF SOILS AND PRODUCTIONS AND WATERED IT WITH INNUMERABLE STREAMS FOR THE DELIGHT AND ACCOMMODATION OF ITS INHABITANTS
IN THE TRADE TO CHINA AND INDIA WE INTERFERE WITH MORE THAN ONE NATION INASMUCH AS IT ENABLES US TO PARTAKE IN ADVANTAGES WHICH THEY HAD IN A MANNER MONOPOLIZED AND AS WE THEREBY SUPPLY OURSELVES WITH COMMODITIES
WE OUGHT TO SEEK IT IN A DIVISION OF THE STATES INTO DISTINCT CONFEDERACIES OR SOVEREIGNTIES HOWEVER EXTRAORDINARY THIS NEW DOCTRINE MAY APPEAR IT NEVERTHELESS HAS ITS ADVOCATES AND CERTAIN CHARACTERS WHO WERE MUCH OPPOSED TO IT FORMERLY
IN THE COURSE OF THE PRECEDING OBSERVATIONS I HAVE HAD AN EYE MY FELLOW CITIZENS TO PUTTING YOU UPON YOUR GUARD AGAINST ALL ATTEMPTS FROM WHATEVER QUARTER TO INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION IN A MATTER OF THE UTMOST MOMENT TO YOUR WELFARE
WHICH WE USED TO PURCHASE FROM THEM THE EXTENSION OF OUR OWN COMMERCE IN OUR OWN VESSELS CANNOT GIVE PLEASURE TO ANY NATIONS WHO POSSESS TERRITORIES ON OR NEAR THIS CONTINENT
AND YOUR HAPPINESS I AFFECT NOT RESERVES WHICH I DO NOT FEEL I WILL NOT AMUSE YOU WITH AN APPEARANCE OF DELIBERATION WHEN I HAVE DECIDED I FRANKLY ACKNOWLEDGE TO YOU MY CONVICTIONS
RESORT TO SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES OF DISTINCT PORTIONS OF THE WHOLE
IF ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAD NOT CALLED FORTH ALL THE NATIONAL MEANS AND MATERIALS FOR FORMING FLEETS THEIR PROWESS AND THEIR THUNDER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CELEBRATED LET ENGLAND HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET
WOULD BE FREE FROM ALL THESE EMBARRASSMENTS AND CONDUCE FAR MORE TO THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE BUT WHATEVER MAY BE OUR SITUATION WHETHER FIRMLY UNITED UNDER ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT OR SPLIT INTO A NUMBER OF CONFEDERACIES
NOT ONLY MANY OF THE OFFICERS OF GOVERNMENT WHO OBEYED THE DICTATES OF PERSONAL INTEREST BUT OTHERS FROM A MISTAKEN ESTIMATE OF CONSEQUENCES OR THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF FORMER ATTACHMENTS
IN WHATEVER PART OF THE UNION THEY MAY BE FOUND
THAT WHEN A PEOPLE OR FAMILY SO DIVIDE IT NEVER FAILS TO BE AGAINST THEMSELVES
CERTAIN IT IS THAT FOREIGN NATIONS WILL KNOW AND VIEW IT EXACTLY AS IT IS AND THEY WILL ACT TOWARD US ACCORDINGLY IF THEY SEE THAT OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IS EFFICIENT AND WELL ADMINISTERED
AND THAT THE NOBLE ENTHUSIASM OF LIBERTY IS APT TO BE INFECTED WITH A SPIRIT OF NARROW AND ILLIBERAL DISTRUST ON THE OTHER HAND IT WILL BE EQUALLY FORGOTTEN THAT THE VIGOR OF GOVERNMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SECURITY OF LIBERTY
THE CRISIS AT WHICH WE ARE ARRIVED MAY WITH PROPRIETY BE REGARDED AS THE ERA IN WHICH THAT DECISION IS TO BE MADE AND A WRONG ELECTION OF THE PART WE SHALL ACT MAY IN THIS VIEW
ENJOYING THE SAME NATIONAL RIGHTS PRIVILEGES AND PROTECTION AS A NATION WE HAVE MADE PEACE AND WAR AS A NATION WE HAVE VANQUISHED OUR COMMON ENEMIES AS A NATION WE HAVE FORMED ALLIANCES
AND THAT OF THOSE MEN WHO HAVE OVERTURNED THE LIBERTIES OF REPUBLICS THE GREATEST NUMBER HAVE BEGUN THEIR CAREER BY PAYING AN OBSEQUIOUS COURT TO THE PEOPLE COMMENCING DEMAGOGUES AND ENDING TYRANTS
WOULD THOSE THREE GOVERNMENTS IF THEY AGREED AT ALL BE ABLE WITH ALL THEIR RESPECTIVE FORCES TO OPERATE AGAINST THE ENEMY SO EFFECTUALLY AS THE SINGLE GOVERNMENT OF GREAT BRITAIN WOULD WE HAVE HEARD MUCH OF THE FLEETS OF BRITAIN
THE HONEST ERRORS OF MINDS LED ASTRAY BY PRECONCEIVED JEALOUSIES AND FEARS SO NUMEROUS INDEED AND SO POWERFUL ARE THE CAUSES WHICH SERVE TO GIVE A FALSE BIAS TO THE JUDGMENT THAT WE UPON MANY OCCASIONS
THAN STATE GOVERNMENTS OR SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES CAN POSSIBLY DO FOR WANT OF CONCERT AND UNITY OF SYSTEM IT CAN PLACE THE MILITIA UNDER ONE PLAN OF DISCIPLINE AND BY PUTTING THEIR OFFICERS IN A PROPER LINE OF SUBORDINATION TO THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE
ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION AND LASTLY THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS ADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT TO LIBERTY AND TO PROPERTY
ARE APT TO OPERATE AS WELL UPON THOSE WHO SUPPORT AS THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE RIGHT SIDE OF A QUESTION WERE THERE NOT EVEN THESE INDUCEMENTS TO MODERATION NOTHING COULD BE MORE ILL JUDGED THAN THAT INTOLERANT SPIRIT WHICH HAS AT ALL TIMES
AND CAN SUPPLY THEIR MARKETS CHEAPER THAN THEY CAN THEMSELVES NOTWITHSTANDING ANY EFFORTS TO PREVENT IT BY BOUNTIES ON THEIR OWN OR DUTIES ON FOREIGN FISH
BUT THIS IS A THING MORE ARDENTLY TO BE WISHED THAN SERIOUSLY TO BE EXPECTED THE PLAN OFFERED TO OUR DELIBERATIONS AFFECTS TOO MANY PARTICULAR INTERESTS INNOVATES UPON TOO MANY LOCAL INSTITUTIONS
AMERICA WILL HAVE REASON TO EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE POET FAREWELL A LONG FAREWELL TO ALL MY GREATNESS
BE ONE NATION UNDER ONE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR THAT THEY SHOULD DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES AND GIVE TO THE HEAD OF EACH THE SAME KIND OF POWERS WHICH THEY ARE ADVISED TO PLACE IN ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
ALTHOUGH SUCH CONDUCT WOULD NOT BE WISE IT WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE NATURAL THE HISTORY OF THE STATES OF GREECE AND OF OTHER COUNTRIES ABOUNDS WITH SUCH INSTANCES AND IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT WHAT HAS SO OFTEN HAPPENED WOULD
AND WHEN THE PROGRESS OF HOSTILITY AND DESOLATION LEFT LITTLE ROOM FOR THOSE CALM AND MATURE INQUIRIES AND REFLECTIONS WHICH MUST EVER PRECEDE THE FORMATION OF A WISE AND WELL BALANCED GOVERNMENT FOR A FREE PEOPLE
OFTEN LEAD HIM TO ENGAGE IN WARS NOT SANCTIFIED BY JUSTICE OR THE VOICE AND INTERESTS OF HIS PEOPLE BUT INDEPENDENT OF THESE INDUCEMENTS TO WAR WHICH ARE MORE PREVALENT IN ABSOLUTE MONARCHIES BUT WHICH WELL DESERVE OUR ATTENTION
BUT THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA AGAINST DANGERS FROM FOREIGN FORCE DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON THEIR FORBEARING TO GIVE JUST CAUSES OF WAR TO OTHER NATIONS BUT ALSO ON THEIR PLACING AND CONTINUING THEMSELVES
THAT EVEN SUCH MEN MAY BE ACTUATED BY UPRIGHT INTENTIONS AND IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THAT MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION WHICH HAS MADE ITS APPEARANCE OR MAY HEREAFTER MAKE ITS APPEARANCE WILL SPRING FROM SOURCES BLAMELESS AT LEAST IF NOT RESPECTABLE
NOT TO INVOLVE IN ITS DISCUSSION A VARIETY OF OBJECTS FOREIGN TO ITS MERITS AND OF VIEWS PASSIONS AND PREJUDICES LITTLE FAVORABLE TO THE DISCOVERY OF TRUTH
MY LAST PAPER ASSIGNED SEVERAL REASONS WHY THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE WOULD BE BEST SECURED BY UNION AGAINST THE DANGER IT MAY BE EXPOSED TO BY JUST CAUSES OF WAR GIVEN TO OTHER NATIONS
BY ANY IMPRESSIONS OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THE EVIDENCE OF TRUTH YOU WILL NO DOUBT AT THE SAME TIME HAVE COLLECTED FROM THE GENERAL SCOPE OF THEM THAT THEY PROCEED FROM A SOURCE NOT UNFRIENDLY TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION
WERE ALSO MEMBERS OF THIS CONVENTION AND CARRIED INTO IT THEIR ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK THAT NOT ONLY THE FIRST BUT EVERY SUCCEEDING CONGRESS AS WELL AS THE LATE CONVENTION
IT HAS UNTIL LATELY BEEN A RECEIVED AND UNCONTRADICTED OPINION THAT THE PROSPERITY OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA DEPENDED ON THEIR CONTINUING FIRMLY UNITED AND THE WISHES PRAYERS AND EFFORTS OF OUR BEST AND WISEST CITIZENS
THAT BODY RECOMMENDED CERTAIN MEASURES TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND THE EVENT PROVED THEIR WISDOM YET IT IS FRESH IN OUR MEMORIES HOW SOON THE PRESS BEGAN TO TEEM WITH PAMPHLETS AND WEEKLY PAPERS AGAINST THOSE VERY MEASURES
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFTER AN UNEQUIVOCAL EXPERIENCE OF THE INEFFICACY OF THE SUBSISTING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU ARE CALLED UPON TO DELIBERATE ON A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
UNDERTOOK THE ARDUOUS TASK IN THE MILD SEASON OF PEACE WITH MINDS UNOCCUPIED BY OTHER SUBJECTS THEY PASSED MANY MONTHS IN COOL UNINTERRUPTED AND DAILY CONSULTATION AND FINALLY
HOWEVER JUST THESE SENTIMENTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO BE WE HAVE ALREADY SUFFICIENT INDICATIONS THAT IT WILL HAPPEN IN THIS AS IN ALL FORMER CASES OF GREAT NATIONAL DISCUSSION A TORRENT OF ANGRY AND MALIGNANT PASSIONS WILL BE LET LOOSE
THIS INTELLIGENT PEOPLE PERCEIVED AND REGRETTED THESE DEFECTS STILL CONTINUING NO LESS ATTACHED TO UNION THAN ENAMORED OF LIBERTY THEY OBSERVED THE DANGER WHICH IMMEDIATELY THREATENED THE FORMER AND MORE REMOTELY THE LATTER
LET SCOTLAND HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET LET WALES HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET LET IRELAND HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET
FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN JAY TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
AND THE MUTUAL TRANSPORTATION AND EXCHANGE OF THEIR VARIOUS COMMODITIES WITH EQUAL PLEASURE I HAVE AS OFTEN TAKEN NOTICE THAT PROVIDENCE HAS BEEN PLEASED TO GIVE THIS ONE CONNECTED COUNTRY TO ONE UNITED PEOPLE
WOULD PUT THE CONTINUANCE OF THE UNION IN THE UTMOST JEOPARDY THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE THE CASE AND I SINCERELY WISH THAT IT MAY BE AS CLEARLY FORESEEN BY EVERY GOOD CITIZEN THAT WHENEVER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION ARRIVES
AND I WILL FREELY LAY BEFORE YOU THE REASONS ON WHICH THEY ARE FOUNDED THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF GOOD INTENTIONS DISDAINS AMBIGUITY I SHALL NOT HOWEVER MULTIPLY PROFESSIONS ON THIS HEAD MY MOTIVES MUST REMAIN IN THE DEPOSITORY OF MY OWN BREAST
EXPERIENCE ON A FORMER OCCASION TEACHES US NOT TO BE TOO SANGUINE IN SUCH HOPES IT IS NOT YET FORGOTTEN THAT WELL GROUNDED APPREHENSIONS OF IMMINENT DANGER INDUCED THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA TO FORM THE MEMORABLE CONGRESS OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
FOR AS OUR CARRYING TRADE CANNOT INCREASE WITHOUT IN SOME DEGREE DIMINISHING THEIRS IT IS MORE THEIR INTEREST AND WILL BE MORE THEIR POLICY TO RESTRAIN THAN TO PROMOTE IT
THE SUBJECT SPEAKS ITS OWN IMPORTANCE COMPREHENDING IN ITS CONSEQUENCES NOTHING LESS THAN THE EXISTENCE OF THE UNION THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE PARTS OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THE FATE OF AN EMPIRE IN MANY RESPECTS THE MOST INTERESTING IN THE WORLD
RELATIVE TO THE OBJECT IN QUESTION MORE COMPETENT THAN ANY OTHER GIVEN NUMBER WHATEVER
WHO SHALL COMMAND THE ALLIED ARMIES AND FROM WHICH OF THEM SHALL HE RECEIVE HIS ORDERS WHO SHALL SETTLE THE TERMS OF PEACE AND IN CASE OF DISPUTES WHAT UMPIRE SHALL DECIDE BETWEEN THEM AND COMPEL ACQUIESCENCE
OR SEDUCED BY A TOO GREAT FONDNESS FOR PEACE TO DECLINE HAZARDING THEIR TRANQUILLITY AND PRESENT SAFETY FOR THE SAKE OF NEIGHBORS OF WHOM PERHAPS THEY HAVE BEEN JEALOUS AND WHOSE IMPORTANCE THEY ARE CONTENT TO SEE DIMINISHED
WILL AS IT WERE CONSOLIDATE THEM INTO ONE CORPS AND THEREBY RENDER THEM MORE EFFICIENT THAN IF DIVIDED INTO THIRTEEN OR INTO THREE OR FOUR DISTINCT INDEPENDENT COMPANIES
FOR SO IS THE FACT THAT THIS PLAN IS ONLY RECOMMENDED NOT IMPOSED YET LET IT BE REMEMBERED THAT IT IS NEITHER RECOMMENDED TO BLIND APPROBATION NOR TO BLIND REPROBATION BUT TO THAT SEDATE AND CANDID CONSIDERATION
FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER SEVENTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN JAY TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
WHICH THE MAGNITUDE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT DEMAND AND WHICH IT CERTAINLY OUGHT TO RECEIVE BUT THIS AS WAS REMARKED IN THE FOREGOING NUMBER OF THIS PAPER IS MORE TO BE WISHED THAN EXPECTED THAT IT MAY BE SO CONSIDERED AND EXAMINED
ARE AT PRESENT OF THE NUMBER WHATEVER MAY BE THE ARGUMENTS OR INDUCEMENTS WHICH HAVE WROUGHT THIS CHANGE IN THE SENTIMENTS AND DECLARATIONS OF THESE GENTLEMEN IT CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE WISE IN THE PEOPLE AT LARGE TO ADOPT THESE NEW POLITICAL TENETS
A PEOPLE DESCENDED FROM THE SAME ANCESTORS SPEAKING THE SAME LANGUAGE PROFESSING THE SAME RELIGION ATTACHED TO THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT VERY SIMILAR IN THEIR MANNERS AND CUSTOMS AND WHO
IT HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY REMARKED THAT IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RESERVED TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY BY THEIR CONDUCT AND EXAMPLE TO DECIDE THE IMPORTANT QUESTION WHETHER SOCIETIES OF MEN ARE REALLY CAPABLE OR NOT
THAT IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF A SOUND AND WELL INFORMED JUDGMENT THEIR INTEREST CAN NEVER BE SEPARATED AND THAT A DANGEROUS AMBITION MORE OFTEN LURKS BEHIND THE SPECIOUS MASK OF ZEAL FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE
AND THEREFORE THAT IT WAS NOT LESS THEIR INCLINATION THAN THEIR DUTY TO RECOMMEND ONLY SUCH MEASURES AS AFTER THE MOST MATURE DELIBERATION THEY REALLY THOUGHT PRUDENT AND ADVISABLE
IN THE PROGRESS OF THIS DISCUSSION I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO GIVE A SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO ALL THE OBJECTIONS WHICH SHALL HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE THAT MAY SEEM TO HAVE ANY CLAIM TO YOUR ATTENTION
JEALOUS AND ALIEN SOVEREIGNTIES SIMILAR SENTIMENTS HAVE HITHERTO PREVAILED AMONG ALL ORDERS AND DENOMINATIONS OF MEN AMONG US TO ALL GENERAL PURPOSES WE HAVE UNIFORMLY BEEN ONE PEOPLE EACH INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN EVERYWHERE
BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE REASONED AND DECIDED JUDICIOUSLY AND HAPPY THEY ARE IN REFLECTING THAT THEY DID SO THEY CONSIDERED THAT THE CONGRESS WAS COMPOSED OF MANY WISE AND EXPERIENCED MEN THAT
IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT A GOVERNMENT INSTITUTED IN TIMES SO INAUSPICIOUS SHOULD ON EXPERIMENT BE FOUND GREATLY DEFICIENT AND INADEQUATE TO THE PURPOSE IT WAS INTENDED TO ANSWER
THAN UNDER THE FORBIDDEN APPEARANCE OF ZEAL FOR THE FIRMNESS AND EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT HISTORY WILL TEACH US THAT THE FORMER HAS BEEN FOUND A MUCH MORE CERTAIN ROAD TO THE INTRODUCTION OF DESPOTISM THAN THE LATTER
SUCH AS THIRST FOR MILITARY GLORY REVENGE FOR PERSONAL AFFRONTS AMBITION OR PRIVATE COMPACTS TO AGGRANDIZE OR SUPPORT THEIR PARTICULAR FAMILIES OR PARTISANS THESE AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MOTIVES WHICH AFFECT ONLY THE MIND OF THE SOVEREIGN
WITHOUT HAVING BEEN AWED BY POWER OR INFLUENCED BY ANY PASSIONS EXCEPT LOVE FOR THEIR COUNTRY THEY PRESENTED AND RECOMMENDED TO THE PEOPLE THE PLAN PRODUCED BY THEIR JOINT AND VERY UNANIMOUS COUNCILS ADMIT
THIS CONVENTION COMPOSED OF MEN WHO POSSESSED THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE AND MANY OF WHOM HAD BECOME HIGHLY DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR PATRIOTISM VIRTUE AND WISDOM IN TIMES WHICH TRIED THE MINDS AND HEARTS OF MEN
FOR IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THAT CONGRESS WHO HAVE BEEN SINCE TRIED AND JUSTLY APPROVED FOR PATRIOTISM AND ABILITIES AND WHO HAVE GROWN OLD IN ACQUIRING POLITICAL INFORMATION
WITH THEM AND WITH MOST OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS WE ARE RIVALS IN NAVIGATION AND THE CARRYING TRADE AND WE SHALL DECEIVE OURSELVES IF WE SUPPOSE THAT ANY OF THEM WILL REJOICE TO SEE IT FLOURISH
TO JUDGE FROM THE CONDUCT OF THE OPPOSITE PARTIES WE SHALL BE LED TO CONCLUDE THAT THEY WILL MUTUALLY HOPE TO EVINCE THE JUSTNESS OF THEIR OPINIONS AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THEIR CONVERTS BY THE LOUDNESS OF THEIR DECLAMATIONS AND THE BITTERNESS OF THEIR INVECTIVES
IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT JEALOUSIES AND UNEASINESSES MAY GRADUALLY SLIDE INTO THE MINDS AND CABINETS OF OTHER NATIONS AND THAT WE ARE NOT TO EXPECT THAT THEY SHOULD REGARD OUR ADVANCEMENT IN UNION IN POWER AND CONSEQUENCE BY LAND AND BY SEA
YES MY COUNTRYMEN I OWN TO YOU THAT AFTER HAVING GIVEN IT AN ATTENTIVE CONSIDERATION I AM CLEARLY OF OPINION IT IS YOUR INTEREST TO ADOPT IT I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS IS THE SAFEST COURSE FOR YOUR LIBERTY YOUR DIGNITY
THE CERTAIN EVILS AND THE PROBABLE DANGERS TO WHICH EVERY STATE WILL BE EXPOSED FROM ITS DISSOLUTION THIS SHALL ACCORDINGLY CONSTITUTE THE SUBJECT OF MY NEXT ADDRESS
SEE WISE AND GOOD MEN ON THE WRONG AS WELL AS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF QUESTIONS OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE TO SOCIETY THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IF DULY ATTENDED TO WOULD FURNISH A LESSON OF MODERATION TO THOSE WHO ARE EVER SO MUCH PERSUADED
AND THOSE REASONS SHOW THAT SUCH CAUSES WOULD NOT ONLY BE MORE RARELY GIVEN BUT WOULD ALSO BE MORE EASILY ACCOMMODATED BY A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THAN EITHER BY THE STATE GOVERNMENTS OR THE PROPOSED LITTLE CONFEDERACIES
THAN CONSISTS WITH THE WISHES OR POLICY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SOVEREIGNS SPAIN THINKS IT CONVENIENT TO SHUT THE MISSISSIPPI AGAINST US ON THE ONE SIDE AND BRITAIN EXCLUDES US FROM THE SAINT LAWRENCE ON THE OTHER
OUR TRADE PRUDENTLY REGULATED OUR MILITIA PROPERLY ORGANIZED AND DISCIPLINED OUR RESOURCES AND FINANCES DISCREETLY MANAGED OUR CREDIT RE ESTABLISHED OUR PEOPLE FREE CONTENTED AND UNITED
AND THE TIME MAY COME IF WE ARE WISE WHEN THE FLEETS OF AMERICA MAY ENGAGE ATTENTION BUT IF ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAD NOT SO REGULATED THE NAVIGATION OF BRITAIN AS TO MAKE IT A NURSERY FOR SEAMEN
THESE AND SIMILAR CONSIDERATIONS THEN INDUCED THE PEOPLE TO RELY GREATLY ON THE JUDGMENT AND INTEGRITY OF THE CONGRESS AND THEY TOOK THEIR ADVICE NOTWITHSTANDING THE VARIOUS ARTS AND ENDEAVORS USED TO DETER THEM FROM IT
THAN THE ALTERNATIVE OF AN ADOPTION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION OR A DISMEMBERMENT OF THE UNION IT WILL THEREFORE BE OF USE TO BEGIN BY EXAMINING THE ADVANTAGES OF THAT UNION
TO INSTITUTE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PRESERVE AND PERPETUATE IT THEY FORMED IT ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY HAD A POLITICAL EXISTENCE NAY AT A TIME WHEN THEIR HABITATIONS WERE IN FLAMES WHEN MANY OF THEIR CITIZENS WERE BLEEDING
THE ARMS AND THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY AS THE SAFETY OF THE WHOLE IS THE INTEREST OF THE WHOLE AND CANNOT BE PROVIDED FOR WITHOUT GOVERNMENT EITHER ONE OR MORE OR MANY LET US INQUIRE WHETHER ONE GOOD GOVERNMENT IS NOT
OF ESTABLISHING GOOD GOVERNMENT FROM REFLECTION AND CHOICE OR WHETHER THEY ARE FOREVER DESTINED TO DEPEND FOR THEIR POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONS ON ACCIDENT AND FORCE IF THERE BE ANY TRUTH IN THE REMARK
NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THE INDISPENSABLE NECESSITY OF GOVERNMENT AND IT IS EQUALLY UNDENIABLE THAT WHENEVER AND HOWEVER IT IS INSTITUTED THE PEOPLE MUST CEDE TO IT
WHAT WOULD THE MILITIA OF BRITAIN BE IF THE ENGLISH MILITIA OBEYED THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND IF THE SCOTCH MILITIA OBEYED THE GOVERNMENT OF SCOTLAND AND IF THE WELSH MILITIA OBEYED THE GOVERNMENT OF WALES SUPPOSE AN INVASION
AMONG THE MOST FORMIDABLE OF THE OBSTACLES WHICH THE NEW CONSTITUTION WILL HAVE TO ENCOUNTER MAY READILY BE DISTINGUISHED THE OBVIOUS INTEREST OF A CERTAIN CLASS OF MEN IN EVERY STATE TO RESIST ALL CHANGES WHICH MAY HAZARD A DIMINUTION
SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MADE FOR EACH OTHER AND IT APPEARS AS IF IT WAS THE DESIGN OF PROVIDENCE THAT AN INHERITANCE SO PROPER AND CONVENIENT FOR A BAND OF BRETHREN UNITED TO EACH OTHER BY THE STRONGEST TIES SHOULD NEVER BE SPLIT INTO A NUMBER OF UNSOCIAL
IN ALL PROBABILITY BE GRADUALLY PROPAGATED TILL IT HAS VOTARIES ENOUGH TO COUNTENANCE AN OPEN AVOWAL OF IT FOR NOTHING CAN BE MORE EVIDENT TO THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO TAKE AN ENLARGED VIEW OF THE SUBJECT
AND BEING PERSUADED THAT AMPLE SECURITY FOR BOTH COULD ONLY BE FOUND IN A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MORE WISELY FRAMED THEY AS WITH ONE VOICE CONVENED THE LATE CONVENTION AT PHILADELPHIA TO TAKE THAT IMPORTANT SUBJECT UNDER CONSIDERATION
IN SUCH A SITUATION AS NOT TO INVITE HOSTILITY OR INSULT FOR IT NEED NOT BE OBSERVED THAT THERE ARE PRETENDED AS WELL AS JUST CAUSES OF WAR IT IS TOO TRUE HOWEVER DISGRACEFUL IT MAY BE TO HUMAN NATURE
BUT IF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE HAD REASON TO CONFIDE IN THE MEN OF THAT CONGRESS FEW OF WHOM HAD BEEN FULLY TRIED OR GENERALLY KNOWN STILL GREATER REASON HAVE THEY NOW TO RESPECT THE JUDGMENT AND ADVICE OF THE CONVENTION
WHAT FLEETS COULD THEY EVER HOPE TO HAVE IF ONE WAS ATTACKED WOULD THE OTHERS FLY TO ITS SUCCOR AND SPEND THEIR BLOOD AND MONEY IN ITS DEFENSE WOULD THERE BE NO DANGER OF THEIR BEING FLATTERED INTO NEUTRALITY BY ITS SPECIOUS PROMISES
SHE HAD NO OTHER LIGHT THAN THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE THE UNKINDLED LAMP STOOD ON THE TABLE SHE SAT ON THE GROUND LOOKING AT THE BRAZIER WITH HER FACE LEANING ON HER HAND
THE WHEELS ROLLED ON AND ROLLED DOWN BY THE MONUMENT AND BY THE TOWER AND BY THE DOCKS DOWN BY RATCLIFFE AND BY ROTHERHITHE
IF THE REAL MAN FEELS AS GUILTY AS I DO SAID EUGENE HE IS REMARKABLY UNCOMFORTABLE INFLUENCE OF SECRECY SUGGESTED LIGHTWOOD
NOT THE SPECIAL CAUSEWAY OF THE SIX JOLLY FELLOWSHIPS WHICH HAD A LANDING PLACE OF ITS OWN BUT ANOTHER A LITTLE REMOVED AND VERY NEAR TO THE OLD WINDMILL WHICH WAS THE DENOUNCED MAN'S DWELLING PLACE WERE A FEW BOATS SOME MOORED AND ALREADY BEGINNING TO FLOAT OTHERS HAULED UP ABOVE THE REACH OF THE TIDE
BOB GLIDDERY RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS FROM MISTER INSPECTOR AND DEPARTED IN A BECOMING STATE OF ALACRITY ENGENDERED BY REVERENCE FOR THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW IT'S A CERTAIN FACT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR THAT THIS MAN WE HAVE RECEIVED OUR INFORMATION FROM
HIGH UP AN AWFUL STAIRCASE COMMANDING A BURIAL GROUND AND I HAVE A WHOLE CLERK TO MYSELF AND HE HAS NOTHING TO DO BUT LOOK AT THE BURIAL GROUND AND WHAT HE WILL TURN OUT WHEN ARRIVED AT MATURITY I CANNOT CONCEIVE
SHE STARTED UP HE HAD BEEN SO VERY STILL THAT HE FELT SURE IT WAS NOT HE WHO HAD DISTURBED HER SO MERELY WITHDREW FROM THE WINDOW AND STOOD NEAR IT IN THE SHADOW OF THE WALL SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SAID IN AN ALARMED TONE FATHER WAS THAT YOU CALLING ME
BLEST IF I CAN MAKE IT OUT SAID HE STARING AT THEM MAKE WHAT OUT HAVE YOU SEEN HIM NO WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN ASKED LIGHTWOOD
BUT HE GLANCED SLIGHTLY AT THEM THOUGH HE LOOKED LONG AND STEADILY AT HER
NO RESPONSE AS SHE RE ENTERED AT THE DOOR HE DROPPED OVER THE BANK AND MADE HIS WAY BACK AMONG THE OOZE AND NEAR THE HIDING PLACE TO MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD TO WHOM HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN OF THE GIRL AND HOW THIS WAS BECOMING VERY GRIM INDEED
EUGENE WITH A LESS WEIGHTY SENSE OF PERSONAL TROUBLE ON HIM THAN HE USUALLY HAD WOULD GO OUT WITH MISTER INSPECTOR NOTE THE SPOT AND COME BACK ON THE SHELVING BANK OF THE RIVER AMONG THE SLIMY STONES OF A CAUSEWAY
HAS FOR SOME TIME PAST GIVEN THE OTHER MAN A BAD NAME ARISING OUT OF YOUR LIME BARGES AND THAT THE OTHER MAN HAS BEEN AVOIDED IN CONSEQUENCE I DON'T SAY WHAT IT MEANS OR PROVES BUT IT'S A CERTAIN FACT
YET IN SPITE OF HAVING THOSE WEIGHTS ON HIS CONSCIENCE EUGENE WAS SOMEWHAT ENLIVENED BY THE LATE SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF AFFAIRS SO WERE HIS TWO COMPANIONS ITS BEING A CHANGE WAS EVERYTHING THE SUSPENSE SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN A NEW LEASE AND TO HAVE BEGUN AFRESH FROM A RECENT DATE
AND AGAIN FATHER AND ONCE AGAIN AFTER LISTENING FATHER I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU CALL ME TWICE BEFORE
SHALL I INCOMMODE YOU IF I PUT MINE UP TOO RETURNED MORTIMER THANK YOU I HATE MINE IT WAS FORCED UPON ME SAID THE GLOOMY EUGENE BECAUSE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT WE WANTED A BARRISTER IN THE FAMILY
AND FORASMUCH AS CROUCHING UNDER THE LEE OF A HAULED UP BOAT ON A NIGHT WHEN IT BLEW COLD AND STRONG AND WHEN THE WEATHER WAS VARIED WITH BLASTS OF HAIL AT TIMES
THOROUGHLY USED TO HIM AS HE WAS HE FOUND SOMETHING NEW AND STRAINED IN HIM THAT WAS FOR THE MOMENT PERPLEXING THIS PASSED INTO HIS MIND AND PASSED OUT AGAIN BUT HE REMEMBERED IT AFTERWARDS
REMARKED EUGENE HE IS STILL THERE NO SAID MISTER INSPECTOR HE HAS QUITTED THOSE WORKS HE IS OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF WILL SHE BE LEFT ALONE THEN ASKED EUGENE SHE WILL BE LEFT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
DO YOU FEEL LIKE A DARK COMBINATION OF TRAITOR AND PICKPOCKET WHEN YOU THINK OF THAT GIRL RATHER RETURNED LIGHTWOOD DO YOU VERY MUCH SO THEIR ESCORT STROLLED BACK AGAIN AND REPORTED
AMONG BOW SPLITS STARING INTO WINDOWS AND WINDOWS STARING INTO SHIPS THE WHEELS ROLLED ON UNTIL THEY STOPPED AT A DARK CORNER RIVER WASHED AND OTHERWISE NOT WASHED AT ALL WHERE THE BOY ALIGHTED AND OPENED THE DOOR YOU MUST WALK THE REST SIR IT'S NOT MANY YARDS
THERE WAS SOMETHING ADDITIONAL TO LOOK FOR THEY WERE ALL THREE MORE SHARPLY ON THE ALERT AND LESS DEADENED BY THE MISERABLE INFLUENCES OF THE PLACE AND TIME MORE THAN AN HOUR HAD PASSED AND THEY WERE EVEN DOZING WHEN ONE OF THE THREE EACH SAID IT WAS HE AND HE HAD NOT DOZED
I ANSWER YOU SIMPLY MOST ON EM DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE HAS BEEN MUCH VIOLENCE AND ROBBERY BEFOREHAND AMONG THESE CASES I DON'T SUPPOSE AT ALL ABOUT IT RETURNED GAFFER I AIN'T ONE OF THE SUPPOSING SORT
BEGAN EUGENE WHICH NO MAN HAS A BETTER RIGHT TO DO THAN YOURSELF YOU KNOW SAID MISTER INSPECTOR I HOPE NOT SAID EUGENE MY FATHER HAVING BEEN A SHIPPER OF LIME BEFORE ME AND MY GRANDFATHER BEFORE HIM
ONLY IT HAD BEEN REGARDED BY MISTER INSPECTOR AS SO UNCOMMONLY SATISFACTORY AND SO FRAUGHT WITH MYSTERIOUS VIRTUES THAT NEITHER OF HIS CLIENTS HAD PRESUMED TO QUESTION IT TWO TAPS WERE NOW HEARD ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW
MADE OUT RIDERHOOD IN HIS BOAT AT THE SPOT AGREED ON THEY SPRANG UP CAME OUT FROM THEIR SHELTER AND WENT DOWN TO HIM WHEN HE SAW THEM COMING HE DROPPED ALONGSIDE THE CAUSEWAY SO THAT THEY STANDING ON THE CAUSEWAY COULD SPEAK WITH HIM IN WHISPERS UNDER THE SHADOWY MASS OF THE SIX JOLLY FELLOWSHIP PORTERS FAST ASLEEP
I AM QUITE AS BAD SAID LIGHTWOOD SITTING UP FACING HIM WITH A TUMBLED HEAD AFTER GOING THROUGH SOME WONDERFUL EVOLUTIONS IN WHICH HIS HEAD HAD BEEN THE LOWEST PART OF HIM THIS RESTLESSNESS BEGAN WITH ME LONG AGO
THERE WAS A CURIOUS MIXTURE IN THE BOY OF UNCOMPLETED SAVAGERY AND UNCOMPLETED CIVILIZATION HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE AND COARSE AND HIS FACE WAS COARSE AND HIS STUNTED FIGURE WAS COARSE BUT HE WAS CLEANER THAN OTHER BOYS OF HIS TYPE AND HIS WRITING THOUGH LARGE AND ROUND WAS GOOD
AND THEN WE SHALL BE SEEN LOOK HERE SAID RIDERHOOD WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THIS HE MAY HAVE BEEN LURKING IN AND OUT AND JUST HOLDING HIS OWN BETWIXT TWO OR THREE BRIDGES FOR HOURS BACK WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
STOICAL BUT CONTRADICTORY HE MAY BE DOING SO AT THIS PRESENT TIME WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR MY BOAT'S AMONG THEM BOATS HERE AT THE CAUSE'AY
MISTER INSPECTOR HAVING PROPOSED AS AN APPROPRIATE SENTIMENT THE LIME TRADE AND BOB WITHDREW TO REPORT THE COMMENDATIONS OF THE GUESTS TO MISS ABBEY IN THE BAR
AT THIS TIME OF THEIR WATCH THE WATER CLOSE TO THEM WOULD BE OFTEN AGITATED BY SOME IMPULSION GIVEN IT FROM A DISTANCE
IT IS SUCH A CONVENTIONAL SUPERSTITION SUCH PARROT GABBLE WHAT THE DEUCE AM I TO RUSH OUT INTO THE STREET COLLAR THE FIRST MAN OF A WEALTHY APPEARANCE THAT I MEET SHAKE HIM AND SAY GO TO LAW UPON THE SPOT YOU DOG AND RETAIN ME OR I'LL BE THE DEATH OF YOU YET THAT WOULD BE ENERGY
SAID THE BOY BUT IF SHE KNOWS HER LETTERS IT'S THE MOST SHE DOES AND THEM I LEARNED HER
DOWN BY WHERE ACCUMULATED SCUM OF HUMANITY SEEMED TO BE WASHED FROM HIGHER GROUNDS LIKE SO MUCH MORAL SEWAGE AND TO BE PAUSING UNTIL ITS OWN WEIGHT FORCED IT OVER THE BANK AND SUNK IT IN THE RIVER
THANK YOU THEN IDIOTS TALK SAID EUGENE LEANING BACK FOLDING HIS ARMS SMOKING WITH HIS EYES SHUT AND SPEAKING SLIGHTLY THROUGH HIS NOSE OF ENERGY IF THERE IS A WORD IN THE DICTIONARY UNDER ANY LETTER FROM A TO Z THAT I ABOMINATE IT IS ENERGY
THEY BURN SHERRY VERY WELL HERE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AS A PIECE OF LOCAL INTELLIGENCE PERHAPS YOU GENTLEMEN MIGHT LIKE A BOTTLE THE ANSWER BEING BY ALL MEANS
MORTIMER APOSTROPHIZED HIM LAUGHING QUITE HEARTILY WHEN THEY WERE ALONE AGAIN HOW CAN YOU BE SO RIDICULOUS I AM IN A RIDICULOUS HUMOUR QUOTH EUGENE I AM A RIDICULOUS FELLOW EVERYTHING IS RIDICULOUS COME ALONG
I DON'T LIKE THIS NOR I SAID LIGHTWOOD SHALL WE GO BEING HERE LET US STAY YOU OUGHT TO SEE IT OUT AND I WON'T LEAVE YOU BESIDES THAT LONELY GIRL WITH THE DARK HAIR RUNS IN MY HEAD
AND REQUESTED TO SEE THE MESSENGER WHO HAD BROUGHT THE PAPER HE WAS A BOY OF ABOUT FIFTEEN MORTIMER LOOKED AT THE BOY AND THE BOY LOOKED AT THE BRAN NEW PILGRIMS ON THE WALL GOING TO CANTERBURY IN MORE GOLD FRAME THAN PROCESSION AND MORE CARVING THAN COUNTRY WHOSE WRITING IS THIS
THE TROUSERS POCKETS EMPTY AND TURNED INSIDE OUT GAFFER HEXAM NODDED BUT THAT'S COMMON
NEXT TIME WITH A VIEW TO OUR PEACE OF MIND WE'LL COMMIT THE CRIME INSTEAD OF TAKING THE CRIMINAL YOU SWEAR IT CERTAINLY SWORN LET TIPPINS LOOK TO IT HER LIFE'S IN DANGER
THAT HAVING MISSED IT FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER HE WAS NOT ACCORDING TO HIS USUAL HABITS AT NIGHT TO BE COUNTED ON BEFORE NEXT HIGH WATER OR IT MIGHT BE AN HOUR OR SO LATER THAT HIS DAUGHTER SURVEYED THROUGH THE WINDOW WOULD SEEM TO BE SO EXPECTING HIM FOR THE SUPPER WAS NOT COOKING BUT SET OUT READY TO BE COOKED
DIVESTED OF ITS VARIOUS LIME LIGHTS AND SHADOWS HIS REPORT WENT TO THE EFFECT THAT GAFFER WAS AWAY IN HIS BOAT SUPPOSED TO BE ON HIS OLD LOOK OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTED LAST HIGH WATER
I HAD IT FIRST FROM ONE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX OF MY ACQUAINTANCE VAGUELY INDICATING MISS ABBEY WITH HIS THUMB OVER HIS SHOULDER DOWN AWAY AT A DISTANCE OVER YONDER THEN PROBABLY MISTER INSPECTOR WAS NOT QUITE UNPREPARED FOR THEIR VISIT THAT EVENING
HE SPOKE IN THE SINGULAR NUMBER TO THE EXPRESS EXCLUSION OF EUGENE THIS IS A CONFOUNDEDLY OUT OF THE WAY PLACE SAID MORTIMER SLIPPING OVER THE STONES AND REFUSE ON THE SHORE AS THE BOY TURNED THE CORNER SHARP HERE'S MY FATHER'S SIR WHERE THE LIGHT IS
HERE I AM SIR AND OUR FRIEND OF THE PERSPIRING BROW IS AT THE FAR CORNER THERE GOOD ANYTHING HAPPENED HIS DAUGHTER HAS BEEN OUT THINKING SHE HEARD HIM CALLING UNLESS IT WAS A SIGN TO HIM TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND WILL I TRUST EXCUSE ME AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER FOR THROWING OUT A REMARK WHICH I FEEL TO BE DUE TO THIS HOUSE AND THE COUNTRY WAS THAT THE T'OTHER GOVERNOR OR LAWYER LIGHTWOOD ASKED RIDERHOOD
BUT THERE WERE BELLS TO WINDWARD THAT TOLD THEM OF ITS BEING ONE TWO THREE WITHOUT THAT AID THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN HOW THE NIGHT WORE BY THE FALLING OF THE TIDE RECORDED IN THE APPEARANCE OF AN EVER WIDENING BLACK WET STRIP OF SHORE
SAID MORTIMER GLANCING RATHER SHRINKINGLY TOWARDS THE BUNK IS IT HERE TAIN'T NOT TO SAY HERE BUT IT'S CLOSE BY I DO EVERYTHING REG'LAR
AND LAZARUS YES AND HIM TOO BUT DON'T YOU TELL MY FATHER WE SHOULD HAVE NO PEACE IN OUR PLACE IF THAT GOT TOUCHED UPON IT'S MY SISTER'S CONTRIVING
AS THE TIME SO PASSED THIS SLINKING BUSINESS BECAME A MORE AND MORE PRECARIOUS ONE
BUT THE WHOLE WAS VERY INDISTINCTLY SEEN IN THE OBSCURITY OF THE NIGHT THE BOY LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE DOOR AND THEY PASSED AT ONCE INTO A LOW CIRCULAR ROOM WHERE A MAN STOOD BEFORE A RED FIRE LOOKING DOWN INTO IT AND A GIRL SAT ENGAGED IN NEEDLEWORK
IF LAZARUS WAS ONLY HALF AS FAR GONE THAT WAS THE GREATEST OF ALL THE MIRACLES HALLOA CRIED MORTIMER TURNING ROUND WITH HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD YOU SEEM TO BE AT HOME IN THE RED SEA MY YOUNG FRIEND READ OF IT WITH TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL SAID THE BOY
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND AT ANY TIME RETURNED EUGENE COME TO ME AT MY WORKS AND YOU'LL ALWAYS FIND AN OPENING IN THE LIME KILN THANKEE SIR SAID BOB THIS IS MY PARTNER
NOW HERE MOVING THE LIGHT TO ANOTHER SIMILAR PLACARD HIS POCKETS WAS FOUND EMPTY AND TURNED INSIDE OUT AND HERE MOVING THE LIGHT TO ANOTHER HER POCKET WAS FOUND EMPTY AND TURNED INSIDE OUT AND SO WAS THIS ONE'S AND SO WAS THAT ONE'S
I AM FAR FROM BEING CLEAR AS TO THE LAST PARTICULAR RETURNED MORTIMER WITH GREAT COMPOSURE THAT I HAVE MUCH ADVANTAGE OVER YOU I HATE SAID EUGENE PUTTING HIS LEGS UP ON THE OPPOSITE SEAT I HATE MY PROFESSION
IF I MIGHT SO FAR PRESUME AS TO OFFER A SUGGESTION TO MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND WHOSE KNOWLEDGE OF NAVAL MATTERS FAR BE IT FROM ME TO IMPEACH EUGENE STRUCK IN WITH GREAT DELIBERATION
MINE SIR WHO TOLD YOU TO WRITE IT MY FATHER JESSE HEXAM IS IT HE WHO FOUND THE BODY YES SIR WHAT IS YOUR FATHER THE BOY HESITATED
THEY WERE NOT INCLINED TO DISPUTE THIS RECOMMENDATION BUT THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THEY COULD JOIN THE WATCHERS WHEN SO DISPOSED RATHER THAN TRUST TO A VERBAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PLACE WHICH MIGHT MISLEAD
THEIR RETREAT WAS SO CHOSEN THAT WHILE THEY COULD WATCH THE RIVER THEY COULD WATCH THE HOUSE NO ONE HAD PASSED IN OR OUT SINCE THE DAUGHTER THOUGHT SHE HEARD THE FATHER CALLING NO ONE COULD PASS IN OR OUT WITHOUT BEING SEEN BUT IT WILL BE LIGHT AT FIVE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
TASTES LIKE THE WASH OF THE RIVER ARE YOU SO FAMILIAR WITH THE FLAVOUR OF THE WASH OF THE RIVER I SEEM TO BE TO NIGHT I FEEL AS IF I HAD BEEN HALF DROWNED AND SWALLOWING A GALLON OF IT INFLUENCE OF LOCALITY SUGGESTED LIGHTWOOD
PRECISELY MY VIEW OF THE CASE EUGENE BUT SHOW ME A GOOD OPPORTUNITY SHOW ME SOMETHING REALLY WORTH BEING ENERGETIC ABOUT AND I'LL SHOW YOU ENERGY AND SO WILL I SAID EUGENE
THE FIRE WAS IN A RUSTY BRAZIER NOT FITTED TO THE HEARTH AND A COMMON LAMP SHAPED LIKE A HYACINTH ROOT SMOKED AND FLARED IN THE NECK OF A STONE BOTTLE ON THE TABLE THERE WAS A WOODEN BUNK OR BERTH IN A CORNER
AND HE GLANCED AT THE BACKS OF THE BOOKS WITH AN AWAKENED CURIOSITY THAT WENT BELOW THE BINDING NO ONE WHO CAN READ EVER LOOKS AT A BOOK EVEN UNOPENED ON A SHELF LIKE ONE WHO CANNOT WERE ANY MEANS TAKEN DO YOU KNOW BOY TO ASCERTAIN IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO RESTORE LIFE
YOU ARE MIGHTY LEARNED TO NIGHT YOU AND YOUR INFLUENCES RETURNED EUGENE HOW LONG SHALL WE STAY HERE HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IF I COULD CHOOSE I SHOULD SAY A MINUTE REPLIED EUGENE
YOU MIGHTN'T BE MUCH GIVEN TO SUPPOSING AM I TO SHOW THE WAY AS HE OPENED THE DOOR IN PURSUANCE OF A NOD FROM LIGHTWOOD AN EXTREMELY PALE AND DISTURBED FACE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THE FACE OF A MAN MUCH AGITATED A BODY MISSING
SAID EUGENE WHEN THEY WERE STANDING UNDER THE BANK ROARED AND RIVEN AT BY THE WIND THERE'S THE LIGHT OF HER FIRE I'LL TAKE A PEEP THROUGH THE WINDOW
IT SHALL BE DONE GENTLEMEN IF IT CAN BE DONE CONVENIENTLY SAID MISTER INSPECTOR WITH COOLNESS THERE IS NO WISH ON MY PART TO CAUSE ANY DISTRESS IN THAT QUARTER INDEED I AM SORRY FOR THAT QUARTER THERE WAS A BOY IN THAT QUARTER
THIS ONE WAS A SAILOR WITH TWO ANCHORS AND A FLAG AND G F T ON HIS ARM LOOK AND SEE IF HE WARN'T QUITE RIGHT THIS ONE WAS THE YOUNG WOMAN IN GREY BOOTS AND HER LINEN MARKED WITH A CROSS LOOK AND SEE IF SHE WARN'T QUITE RIGHT
THERE MAY TURN OUT TO BE SOMETHING CONSIDERABLE FOR HIM THAT COMES IN SECOND AND I DON'T MENTION WHO MAY OR WHO MAY NOT TRY FOR THAT PLACE
ALWAYS WELL DISPOSED TO ASSIST THE CONSTITUTED AUTHORITIES MISS ABBEY BADE BOB GLIDDERY ATTEND THE GENTLEMEN TO THAT RETREAT AND PROMPTLY ENLIVEN IT WITH FIRE AND GASLIGHT
HE COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE SHINING THROUGH THE WINDOW PERHAPS IT DREW HIM ON TO LOOK IN PERHAPS HE HAD COME OUT WITH THE EXPRESS INTENTION
TWO OR THREE OLD SCULLS AND OARS STOOD AGAINST THE WALL AND AGAINST ANOTHER PART OF THE WALL WAS A SMALL DRESSER MAKING A SPARE SHOW OF THE COMMONEST ARTICLES OF CROCKERY AND COOKING VESSELS THE ROOF OF THE ROOM WAS NOT PLASTERED BUT WAS FORMED OF THE FLOORING OF THE ROOM ABOVE
IT PASSED INTO MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD'S MIND THAT A CHANGE OF SOME SORT BEST EXPRESSED PERHAPS AS AN INTENSIFICATION OF ALL THAT WAS WILDEST AND MOST NEGLIGENT AND RECKLESS IN HIS FRIEND HAD COME UPON HIM IN THE LAST HALF HOUR OR SO
IN FACT WE HAVING BEEN A FAMILY IMMERSED TO THE CROWNS OF OUR HEADS IN LIME DURING SEVERAL GENERATIONS
MORTIMER RANG THE BELL TO PAY THE SCORE AND BOB APPEARED TO TRANSACT THAT BUSINESS WITH HIM WHOM EUGENE IN HIS CARELESS EXTRAVAGANCE ASKED IF HE WOULD LIKE A SITUATION IN THE LIME TRADE THANKEE SIR NO SIR SAID BOB I'VE A GOOD SITIWATION HERE SIR
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN RULE BRITANNIA MUTTERED EUGENE BUT IT WASN'T MORTIMER HERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MISTER INSPECTOR TWO BURGLARIES NOW AND A FORGERY
THIS IS HIM AS HAD A NASTY CUT OVER THE EYE THIS IS THEM TWO YOUNG SISTERS WHAT TIED THEMSELVES TOGETHER WITH A HANDKECHER THIS THE DRUNKEN OLD CHAP IN A PAIR OF LIST SLIPPERS AND A NIGHTCAP WOT HAD OFFERED IT AFTERWARDS COME OUT
MAY BE ENDOWED WITH PHILANTHROPY ENOUGH TO TURN BOTTOM UPWARD AND EXTINGUISH HIM MORTIMER MY HONOURABLE FRIEND THREE BURGLARIES TWO FORGERIES AND A MIDNIGHT ASSASSINATION
OF THIS COMMISSION THE BARE ARMED BOB LEADING THE WAY WITH A FLAMING WISP OF PAPER SO SPEEDILY ACQUITTED HIMSELF THAT COSY SEEMED TO LEAP OUT OF A DARK SLEEP AND EMBRACE THEM WARMLY THE MOMENT THEY PASSED THE LINTELS OF ITS HOSPITABLE DOOR
MORTIMER INQUIRED AS HE SOUGHT FOR HIS HAT YOU WOULDN'T ASK SIR IF YOU KNEW HIS STATE
WITH THIS INDICATION OF HIS DEPRESSED STATE OF MIND EUGENE FELL SILENT THEY WERE ALL SILENT FOR A LONG WHILE AS IT GOT TO BE FLOOD TIDE AND THE WATER CAME NEARER TO THEM NOISES ON THE RIVER BECAME MORE FREQUENT AND THEY LISTENED MORE
BUT FOR THE IMMOBILITY WITH WHICH THE INFORMER WELL USED TO THE RIVER KEPT QUIET IN HIS PLACE
AND EACH OF US HAS THE FOURTH OF A CLERK CASSIM BABA IN THE ROBBER'S CAVE AND CASSIM IS THE ONLY RESPECTABLE MEMBER OF THE PARTY I AM ONE BY MYSELF ONE SAID MORTIMER
EUGENE VOUCHSAFED NO ANSWER BUT MADE THE PROPOSAL TO MORTIMER I'LL GO WITH YOU IF YOU LIKE SO THEY ALL THREE WENT AWAY TOGETHER IN THE VEHICLE THAT HAD BROUGHT THE BOY THE TWO FRIENDS ONCE BOYS TOGETHER AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL INSIDE SMOKING CIGARS
YOU MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A WORSE OPINION SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AFTER BRIEF CONSIDERATION TRY IT STOP A BIT LET'S WORK IT OUT IF I WANT YOU I'LL DROP ROUND UNDER THE FELLOWSHIPS AND TIP YOU A WHISTLE
THE TWO FRIENDS READ THE HANDBILL AS IT STUCK AGAINST THE WALL AND GAFFER READ THEM AS HE HELD THE LIGHT ONLY PAPERS ON THE UNFORTUNATE MAN I SEE SAID LIGHTWOOD GLANCING FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WAS FOUND TO THE FINDER ONLY PAPERS
WHETHER IN THAT SHABBY ROOK'S NEST HE IS ALWAYS PLOTTING WISDOM OR PLOTTING MURDER WHETHER HE WILL GROW UP AFTER SO MUCH SOLITARY BROODING TO ENLIGHTEN HIS FELLOW CREATURES OR TO POISON THEM IS THE ONLY SPECK OF INTEREST THAT PRESENTS ITSELF TO MY PROFESSIONAL VIEW
THE LOW BUILDING HAD THE LOOK OF HAVING ONCE BEEN A MILL
DEMANDED THE INFORMER ALL
NO TIME AIN'T BEEN LOST ON ANY HAND THE POLICE HAVE PUT INTO PRINT ALREADY AND HERE'S WHAT THE PRINT SAYS OF IT TAKING UP THE BOTTLE WITH THE LAMP IN IT HE HELD IT NEAR A PAPER ON THE WALL WITH THE POLICE HEADING BODY FOUND
I HAVE BEEN EUGENE UPON THE HONOURABLE ROLL OF SOLICITORS OF THE HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY AND ATTORNEYS AT COMMON LAW FIVE YEARS AND EXCEPT GRATUITOUSLY TAKING INSTRUCTIONS ON AN AVERAGE ONCE A FORTNIGHT FOR THE WILL OF LADY TIPPINS WHO HAS NOTHING TO LEAVE
WHICH I CHERISH NEXT TO MY LIFE BEING PRESENT I THINK IT MIGHT BE A MORE AGREEABLE PROCEEDING TO THE ASSISTING BYSTANDERS THAT IS TO SAY LIME BURNERS I ALSO SAID LIGHTWOOD PUSHING HIS FRIEND ASIDE WITH A LAUGH SHOULD MUCH PREFER THAT
IT WAS A LITTLE WINDOW OF BUT FOUR PIECES OF GLASS AND WAS NOT CURTAINED HE CHOSE IT BECAUSE THE LARGER WINDOW NEAR IT WAS IT SHOWED HIM THE ROOM AND THE BILLS UPON THE WALL RESPECTING THE DROWNED PEOPLE STARTING OUT AND RECEDING BY TURNS
IN THE MATTER OF THIS LIME I CERTAINLY HAD AN IDEA THAT IT MIGHT LIE BETWIXT THE TWO MEN I ALWAYS HAD THAT IDEA STILL I WAS FORCED TO WAIT FOR A START AND I WASN'T SO LUCKY AS TO GET A START
ASKED GAFFER HEXAM STOPPING SHORT OR A BODY FOUND WHICH
PLACING THESE ON THE TABLE AND BENDING OVER THE FIRE MERITORIOUSLY SENSIBLE OF THE TRYING NATURE OF HIS DUTY HE WATCHED THE WREATHS OF STEAM
IT'S A GOODISH STRETCH SIR I COME UP IN A CAB AND THE CAB'S WAITING TO BE PAID WE COULD GO BACK IN IT BEFORE YOU PAID IT IF YOU LIKED
ANOTHER MAN AS THE DISAPPEARING SKIRTS OF THE LADIES ASCENDED THE VENEERING STAIRCASE MORTIMER FOLLOWING THEM FORTH FROM THE DINING ROOM TURNED INTO A LIBRARY OF BRAN NEW BOOKS IN BRAN NEW BINDINGS LIBERALLY GILDED
ALONE BOB'S REAPPEARANCE WITH A STEAMING JUG BROKE OFF THE CONVERSATION BUT ALTHOUGH THE JUG STEAMED FORTH A DELICIOUS PERFUME ITS CONTENTS HAD NOT RECEIVED THAT LAST HAPPY TOUCH WHICH THE SURPASSING FINISH OF THE SIX JOLLY FELLOWSHIP PORTERS IMPARTED ON SUCH MOMENTOUS OCCASIONS
IN A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS CLEAR AND CREEPING UP THE RIVER UNDER THEIR OWN SHORE EUGENE HAD RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW TO LOOK INTO THE DARKNESS AFTER HIM I WISH THE BOAT OF MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND HE MURMURED LYING DOWN AGAIN AND SPEAKING INTO HIS HAT
CAUSING IT TO SEND FORTH ONE GENTLE HISS THEN HE RESTORED THE CONTENTS TO THE JUG HELD OVER THE STEAM OF THE JUG EACH OF THE THREE BRIGHT GLASSES IN SUCCESSION FINALLY FILLED THEM ALL AND WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AWAITED THE APPLAUSE OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES IT WAS BESTOWED
WHEN THE BOY SPOKE THESE WORDS SLIGHTINGLY OF HIS SISTER HE TOOK HIM ROUGHLY ENOUGH BY THE CHIN AND TURNED UP HIS FACE TO LOOK AT IT WELL I'M SURE SIR SAID THE BOY RESISTING I HOPE YOU'LL KNOW ME AGAIN
LIGHTWOOD HINTED WELL YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR IT WAS A QUESTION OF MAKING A MOVE IT'S OF NO USE MOVING IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR MOVE IS YOU HAD BETTER BY FAR KEEP STILL
IT WAS FORCED UPON ME SAID MORTIMER BECAUSE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT WE WANTED A SOLICITOR IN THE FAMILY AND WE HAVE GOT A PRECIOUS ONE THERE ARE FOUR OF US WITH OUR NAMES PAINTED ON A DOOR POST IN RIGHT OF ONE BLACK HOLE CALLED A SET OF CHAMBERS SAID EUGENE
YOU'LL MAKE OUT THAT THERE'S A SPECK OF SOMETHING OR ANOTHER THERE AND YOU'LL KNOW IT'S ME AND YOU'LL COME DOWN THAT CAUSE'AY TO ME UNDERSTOOD ALL UNDERSTOOD ALL OFF SHE GOES THEN IN A MOMENT WITH THE WIND CUTTING KEENLY AT HIM SIDEWAYS HE WAS STAGGERING DOWN TO HIS BOAT
FOR THE JOLLY FELLOWSHIP PORTERS ARE NOT THE JOLLIEST DOGS I HAVE KNOWN BUT I SUPPOSE WE ARE BEST HERE UNTIL THEY TURN US OUT WITH THE OTHER SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS AT MIDNIGHT
IT WON'T DO MORTIMER WE MUST GET INTO THE AIR WE MUST JOIN OUR DEAR FRIEND AND BROTHER RIDERHOOD
THE GENTLEMAN FATHER THE FIGURE AT THE RED FIRE TURNED RAISED ITS RUFFLED HEAD AND LOOKED LIKE A BIRD OF PREY YOU'RE MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD ESQUIRE ARE YOU SIR MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD IS MY NAME WHAT YOU FOUND
TO THE TURNING OF STEAM PADDLES TO THE CLINKING OF IRON CHAIN TO THE CREAKING OF BLOCKS TO THE MEASURED WORKING OF OARS TO THE OCCASIONAL VIOLENT BARKING OF SOME PASSING DOG ON SHIPBOARD WHO SEEMED TO SCENT THEM LYING IN THEIR HIDING PLACE
FOR THEY SPOKE AS THEY CROUCHED OR LAY WITHOUT SEEING ONE ANOTHER'S FACES IN REPLY TO THE QUESTION PUT BY MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND SAID EUGENE WHO WAS LYING ON HIS BACK WITH HIS HAT ON HIS FACE
I HAVE HAD NO SCRAP OF BUSINESS BUT THIS ROMANTIC BUSINESS AND I SAID EUGENE
THAT PART OF THE BANK HAVING RANK GRASS GROWING ON IT THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING CLOSE WITHOUT ANY NOISE OF FOOTSTEPS IT WAS BUT TO SCRAMBLE UP A RAGGED FACE OF PRETTY HARD MUD SOME THREE OR FOUR FEET HIGH AND COME UPON THE GRASS AND TO THE WINDOW HE CAME TO THE WINDOW BY THAT MEANS
THAT IT WOULD BE HIGH WATER AT ABOUT ONE AND THAT IT WAS NOW BARELY TEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT WATCH AND WAIT THAT THE INFORMER WAS KEEPING WATCH AT THE INSTANT OF THAT PRESENT REPORTING BUT THAT TWO HEADS WERE BETTER THAN ONE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SECOND WAS MISTER INSPECTOR'S
MISTER INSPECTOR HASTILY FORTIFYING HIMSELF WITH ANOTHER GLASS STROLLED OUT WITH A NOISELESS FOOT AND AN UNOCCUPIED COUNTENANCE AS ONE MIGHT GO TO SURVEY THE WEATHER AND THE GENERAL ASPECT OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES THIS IS BECOMING GRIM MORTIMER SAID EUGENE IN A LOW VOICE
AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF YOUR BOAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR WHAT IF I PUT OFF IN HER AND TAKE A LOOK ROUND
THEY PRETTY WELL PAPERS THE ROOM YOU SEE BUT I KNOW EM ALL I'M SCHOLAR ENOUGH HE WAVED THE LIGHT OVER THE WHOLE AS IF TO TYPIFY THE LIGHT OF HIS SCHOLARLY INTELLIGENCE AND THEN PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE AND STOOD BEHIND IT LOOKING INTENTLY AT HIS VISITORS
HIS MOVEMENTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLANNED TO GAIN FOR HIM IN GETTING BEYOND THEIR REACH TWELVE HOURS ADVANTAGE THE HONEST MAN WHO HAD EXPENDED THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW BECAME UNEASY AND BEGAN TO COMPLAIN WITH BITTERNESS OF THE PRONENESS OF MANKIND TO CHEAT HIM HIM INVESTED WITH THE DIGNITY OF LABOUR
BOB CARRIED IN HIS LEFT HAND ONE OF THOSE IRON MODELS OF SUGAR LOAF HATS BEFORE MENTIONED INTO WHICH HE EMPTIED THE JUG AND THE POINTED END OF WHICH HE THRUST DEEP DOWN INTO THE FIRE SO LEAVING IT FOR A FEW MOMENTS WHILE HE DISAPPEARED AND REAPPEARED WITH THREE BRIGHT DRINKING GLASSES
THE MESSENGER ON THE BOX BESIDE THE DRIVER LET ME SEE SAID MORTIMER AS THEY WENT ALONG
COME TO OUR HONEST FRIEND HE LED HIM TO THE POST OF WATCH AND THEY BOTH DROPPED DOWN AND CREPT UNDER THE LEE OF THE BOAT
GIVE ME SOME MORE OF THAT STUFF
THE NIGHT WAS NOT SO DARK BUT THAT BESIDES THE LIGHTS AT BOWS AND MASTHEADS GLIDING TO AND FRO THEY COULD DISCERN SOME SHADOWY BULK ATTACHED AND NOW AND THEN A GHOSTLY LIGHTER WITH A LARGE DARK SAIL LIKE A WARNING ARM WOULD START UP VERY NEAR THEM PASS ON AND VANISH
AND OFF TO SEA LIKE JOLLY COMPANIONS WHY THEN WE'LL TALK MISTER HAWKINS OVER WE WILL AND WE'LL GIVE HIM HIS SHARE TO BE SURE FOR ALL HIS KINDNESS
BUT SHE WAS A CLANNISH CREATURE AND RUSHED AT ONCE TO THE DEFENCE OF HER BROTHER NEVER MIND THAT MAN SHE SAID POINTEDLY
WE'LL HAVE TO JUMP ABOUT AND FIND OUT AND THEN MATES US THAT HAS THE BOATS I RECKON HAS THE UPPER HAND THUS HE KEPT RUNNING ON WITH HIS MOUTH FULL OF THE HOT BACON THUS HE RESTORED THEIR HOPE AND CONFIDENCE AND
AND NOW HE SANG FIFTEEN MEN WERE HIS ONLY SONG MATES
COULD ONLY BE DECIDED ON THE SPOT
WHEN THEY PUT A CLOTHES SACK ON THE FRONT OF THE SLED SHE SUGGESTED IT SHOULD GO ON THE BACK AND WHEN THEY HAD PUT IT ON THE BACK AND COVERED IT OVER WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER BUNDLES SHE DISCOVERED OVERLOOKED ARTICLES WHICH COULD ABIDE NOWHERE ELSE BUT IN THAT VERY SACK AND THEY UNLOADED AGAIN
AT THE FOOT OF A PRETTY BIG PINE AND INVOLVED IN A GREEN CREEPER WHICH HAD EVEN PARTLY LIFTED SOME OF THE SMALLER BONES A HUMAN SKELETON LAY WITH A FEW SHREDS OF CLOTHING ON THE GROUND I BELIEVE A CHILL STRUCK FOR A MOMENT TO EVERY HEART
BUT BY LITTLE AND LITTLE THE HILL BEGAN TO STEEPEN AND BECOME STONY UNDER FOOT AND THE WOOD TO CHANGE ITS CHARACTER AND TO GROW IN A MORE OPEN ORDER IT WAS INDEED A MOST PLEASANT PORTION OF THE ISLAND THAT WE WERE NOW APPROACHING
CHAPTER FIVE THE TOIL OF TRACE AND TRAIL THIRTY DAYS FROM THE TIME IT LEFT DAWSON THE SALT WATER MAIL WITH BUCK AND HIS MATES AT THE FORE ARRIVED AT SKAGUAY THEY WERE IN A WRETCHED STATE WORN OUT AND WORN DOWN
HE HAD STILL A FOOT IN EITHER CAMP AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT HE WOULD PREFER WEALTH AND FREEDOM WITH THE PIRATES TO A BARE ESCAPE FROM HANGING WHICH WAS THE BEST HE HAD TO HOPE ON OUR SIDE NAY AND EVEN IF THINGS
JUST THEN A MAN HAILED US FROM THE FIRE THAT BREAKFAST WAS READY AND WE WERE SOON SEATED HERE AND THERE ABOUT THE SAND OVER BISCUIT AND FRIED JUNK
JIM THAT'S ONE TO YOU THIS IS THE FIRST GLINT OF HOPE I HAD SINCE THE ATTACK FAILED
EATING AWAY WITH CAPTAIN FLINT UPON HIS SHOULDER HAD NOT A WORD OF BLAME FOR THEIR RECKLESSNESS AND THIS THE MORE SURPRISED ME FOR I THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER SHOWN HIMSELF SO CUNNING AS HE DID THEN
AND WHAT WITH WASTED FOOD AND SLEEPING SENTRIES THOUGH THEY WERE BOLD ENOUGH FOR A BRUSH AND BE DONE WITH IT I COULD SEE THEIR ENTIRE UNFITNESS FOR ANYTHING LIKE A PROLONGED CAMPAIGN EVEN SILVER
HAL AND HIS SISTER AND BROTHER IN LAW LISTENED UNWILLINGLY PITCHED TENT AND OVERHAULED THE OUTFIT CANNED GOODS WERE TURNED OUT THAT MADE MEN LAUGH FOR CANNED GOODS ON THE LONG TRAIL IS A THING TO DREAM ABOUT
HE CURSED LIKE A MADMAN WHEN THE FLIES SETTLED ON HIS HOT AND SHINY COUNTENANCE HE PLUCKED FURIOUSLY AT THE LINE THAT HELD ME TO HIM AND FROM TIME TO TIME TURNED HIS EYES UPON ME WITH A DEADLY LOOK CERTAINLY HE TOOK NO PAINS TO HIDE HIS THOUGHTS AND CERTAINLY I READ THEM LIKE PRINT
CHARLES TURNED HIS BACK AND DREW THE LASHINGS DOWN AS WELL AS HE COULD WHICH WAS NOT IN THE LEAST WELL AN OF COURSE THE DOGS CAN HIKE ALONG ALL DAY WITH THAT CONTRAPTION BEHIND THEM AFFIRMED A SECOND OF THE MEN CERTAINLY
IT WAS NOT THE DEAD TIREDNESS THAT COMES THROUGH BRIEF AND EXCESSIVE EFFORT FROM WHICH RECOVERY IS A MATTER OF HOURS BUT IT WAS THE DEAD TIREDNESS THAT COMES THROUGH THE SLOW AND PROLONGED STRENGTH DRAINAGE OF MONTHS OF TOIL
HE WAS A SEAMAN SAID GEORGE MERRY WHO BOLDER THAN THE REST HAD GONE UP CLOSE AND WAS EXAMINING THE RAGS OF CLOTHING LEASTWAYS THIS IS GOOD SEA CLOTH AYE AYE SAID SILVER LIKE ENOUGH
NO SPRING OR REBOUND WAS LEFT IN THEM THEIR FEET FELL HEAVILY ON THE TRAIL JARRING THEIR BODIES AND DOUBLING THE FATIGUE OF A DAY'S TRAVEL THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH THEM EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE DEAD TIRED
BUT THIS TIME FOLLOWING THE ADVICE HAL BROKE OUT THE RUNNERS WHICH HAD BEEN FROZEN TO THE SNOW THE OVERLOADED AND UNWIELDY SLED FORGED AHEAD BUCK AND HIS MATES STRUGGLING FRANTICALLY UNDER THE RAIN OF BLOWS A HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD THE PATH TURNED
WHEN THAT UNGODLY BUCCANEER WITH THE BLUE FACE HE WHO DIED AT SAVANNAH SINGING AND SHOUTING FOR DRINK HAD THERE WITH HIS OWN HAND CUT DOWN HIS SIX ACCOMPLICES THIS GROVE THAT WAS NOW SO PEACEFUL
IT'S SPRINGTIME AND YOU WON'T GET ANY MORE COLD WEATHER THE MAN REPLIED SHE SHOOK HER HEAD DECIDEDLY
SHOUT AFTER SHOUT CAME FROM HIM AND THE OTHERS BEGAN TO RUN IN HIS DIRECTION HE CAN'T A FOUND THE TREASURE SAID OLD MORGAN HURRYING PAST US FROM THE RIGHT
IF IT AIN'T NO GOOD TO SWEAR BY WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE A SPERRIT WOULD GIVE FOR IT NOT THAT AND HE SNAPPED HIS BIG FINGERS HALTING A MOMENT ON HIS CRUTCH BUT DICK WAS NOT TO BE COMFORTED INDEED IT WAS SOON PLAIN TO ME THAT THE LAD WAS FALLING SICK
AND THE FOREMOST BROKE INTO A RUN AND SUDDENLY NOT TEN YARDS FURTHER WE BEHELD THEM STOP A LOW CRY AROSE SILVER DOUBLED HIS PACE DIGGING AWAY WITH THE FOOT OF HIS CRUTCH LIKE ONE POSSESSED AND NEXT MOMENT HE AND I HAD COME ALSO TO A DEAD HALT
THE TREASURE HUNT FLINT'S POINTER JIM SAID SILVER WHEN WE WERE ALONE IF I SAVED YOUR LIFE YOU SAVED MINE AND I'LL NOT FORGET IT I SEEN THE DOCTOR WAVING YOU TO RUN FOR IT WITH THE TAIL OF MY EYE I DID
OR HARDER STILL TO UNDERSTAND THE DOCTOR'S LAST WARNING TO SILVER LOOK OUT FOR SQUALLS WHEN YOU FIND IT AND YOU WILL READILY BELIEVE HOW LITTLE TASTE I FOUND IN MY BREAKFAST AND WITH HOW UNEASY A HEART I SET FORTH BEHIND MY CAPTORS
THERE ARE THREE TALL TREES SAID HE ABOUT IN THE RIGHT LINE FROM SKELETON ISLAND SPY GLASS SHOULDER I TAKE IT
HIS HANDS RAISED ABOVE HIS HEAD LIKE A DIVER'S POINTING DIRECTLY IN THE OPPOSITE I'VE TAKEN A NOTION INTO MY OLD NUMBSKULL OBSERVED SILVER HERE'S THE COMPASS THERE'S THE TIP
BESIDES THE GREAT CUTLASS AT HIS WAIST AND A PISTOL IN EACH POCKET OF HIS SQUARE TAILED COAT TO COMPLETE HIS STRANGE APPEARANCE CAPTAIN FLINT SAT PERCHED UPON HIS SHOULDER AND GABBLING ODDS AND ENDS OF PURPOSELESS SEA TALK
OF SOME AMBIGUITY THEY RAN THE READER MAY REMEMBER THUS TALL TREE SPY GLASS SHOULDER BEARING A POINT TO THE N OF N N E SKELETON ISLAND
IT'S CHILD'S PLAY TO FIND THE STUFF NOW I'VE HALF A MIND TO DINE FIRST I DON'T FEEL SHARP GROWLED MORGAN THINKIN O FLINT I THINK IT WERE AS DONE ME
AGAIN HAL'S WHIP FELL UPON THE DOGS THEY THREW THEMSELVES AGAINST THE BREAST BANDS DUG THEIR FEET INTO THE PACKED SNOW GOT DOWN LOW TO IT AND PUT FORTH ALL THEIR STRENGTH THE SLED HELD AS THOUGH IT WERE AN ANCHOR
DEARS SHE CRIED SYMPATHETICALLY WHY DON'T YOU PULL HARD THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE WHIPPED BUCK DID NOT LIKE HER BUT HE WAS FEELING TOO MISERABLE TO RESIST HER TAKING IT AS PART OF THE DAY'S MISERABLE WORK
THESE ADDED TO THE SIX OF THE ORIGINAL TEAM AND TEEK AND KOONA THE HUSKIES OBTAINED AT THE RINK RAPIDS ON THE RECORD TRIP BROUGHT THE TEAM UP TO FOURTEEN
FOR MY PART I WAS HORRIBLY CAST DOWN SHOULD THE SCHEME HE HAD NOW SKETCHED PROVE FEASIBLE SILVER ALREADY DOUBLY A TRAITOR WOULD NOT HESITATE TO ADOPT IT
DURING THE LAST EIGHTEEN HUNDRED OF WHICH THEY HAD HAD BUT FIVE DAYS REST WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT SKAGUAY THEY WERE APPARENTLY ON THEIR LAST LEGS THEY COULD BARELY KEEP THE TRACES TAUT AND ON THE DOWN GRADES JUST MANAGED TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE SLED
BUT IT'S OVER AND DONE I'LL TAKE HIM IN A LINE WHEN WE GO TREASURE HUNTING FOR WE'LL KEEP HIM LIKE SO MUCH GOLD IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS YOU MARK AND IN THE MEANTIME ONCE WE GOT THE SHIP AND TREASURE BOTH
GIVING THE LIE TO THE LIMPLY DROOPING LIP IT CONCEALED HAL WAS A YOUNGSTER OF NINETEEN OR TWENTY WITH A BIG COLT'S REVOLVER AND A HUNTING KNIFE STRAPPED ABOUT HIM ON A BELT THAT FAIRLY BRISTLED WITH CARTRIDGES THIS BELT WAS THE MOST SALIENT THING ABOUT HIM
IN HIS LIFETIME OF DECEIT HAD OFTEN SUCCESSFULLY FEIGNED A HURT LEG WAS NOW LIMPING IN EARNEST SOL LEKS WAS LIMPING AND DUB WAS SUFFERING FROM A WRENCHED SHOULDER BLADE THEY WERE ALL TERRIBLY FOOTSORE
AND SINCE DOGS COUNT FOR LITTLE AGAINST DOLLARS THEY WERE TO BE SOLD THREE DAYS PASSED BY WHICH TIME BUCK AND HIS MATES FOUND HOW REALLY TIRED AND WEAK THEY WERE THEN ON THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH DAY
THERE WAS NO POWER OF RECUPERATION LEFT NO RESERVE STRENGTH TO CALL UPON
SHE WAS CHARLES'S WIFE AND HAL'S SISTER A NICE FAMILY PARTY BUCK WATCHED THEM APPREHENSIVELY AS THEY PROCEEDED TO TAKE DOWN THE TENT AND LOAD THE SLED THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT ABOUT THEIR MANNER BUT NO BUSINESSLIKE METHOD
I SAW HIM DEAD WITH THESE HERE DEADLIGHTS SAID MORGAN BILLY TOOK ME IN THERE HE LAID WITH
HE A CRIPPLE AND I A BOY AGAINST FIVE STRONG AND ACTIVE SEAMEN ADD TO THIS DOUBLE APPREHENSION THE MYSTERY THAT STILL HUNG OVER THE BEHAVIOUR OF MY FRIENDS THEIR UNEXPLAINED DESERTION OF THE STOCKADE THEIR INEXPLICABLE CESSION OF THE CHART
YOU CAN HELP THEM A MIGHTY LOT BY BREAKING OUT THAT SLED THE RUNNERS ARE FROZE FAST THROW YOUR WEIGHT AGAINST THE GEE POLE RIGHT AND LEFT AND BREAK IT OUT A THIRD TIME THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE
THREE MEN FROM A NEIGHBORING TENT CAME OUT AND LOOKED ON GRINNING AND WINKING AT ONE ANOTHER YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT SMART LOAD AS IT IS SAID ONE OF THEM AND IT'S NOT ME SHOULD TELL YOU YOUR BUSINESS BUT I WOULDN'T TOTE THAT TENT ALONG IF I WAS YOU
THE TOP OF THE PLATEAU WAS DOTTED THICKLY WITH PINE TREES OF VARYING HEIGHT EVERY HERE AND THERE ONE OF A DIFFERENT SPECIES ROSE FORTY OR FIFTY FEET CLEAR ABOVE ITS NEIGHBOURS AND WHICH OF THESE WAS THE PARTICULAR TALL TREE OF CAPTAIN FLINT
THEY WOULD HAVE RUN AWAY SEVERALLY HAD THEY DARED BUT FEAR KEPT THEM TOGETHER AND KEPT THEM CLOSE BY JOHN AS IF HIS DARING HELPED THEM HE ON HIS PART HAD PRETTY WELL FOUGHT HIS WEAKNESS DOWN SPERRIT WELL MAYBE HE SAID
INDEED I HAD TO LEND HIM A HAND OR HE MUST HAVE MISSED HIS FOOTING AND FALLEN BACKWARD DOWN THE HILL WE HAD THUS PROCEEDED FOR ABOUT HALF A MILE AND WERE APPROACHING THE BROW OF THE PLATEAU WHEN THE MAN UPON THE FARTHEST LEFT BEGAN TO CRY ALOUD AS IF IN TERROR
MUST THEN HAVE RUNG WITH CRIES I THOUGHT AND EVEN WITH THE THOUGHT I COULD BELIEVE I HEARD IT RINGING STILL WE WERE NOW AT THE MARGIN OF THE THICKET HUZZA MATES ALL TOGETHER SHOUTED MERRY
DIS IS DE LAS DEN WE GET ONE LONG RES EH FOR SURE ONE BULLY LONG RES THE DRIVERS CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED A LONG STOPOVER THEMSELVES
IN THE IMMEDIATE NEARNESS OF THE GOLD ALL ELSE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN HIS PROMISE AND THE DOCTOR'S WARNING WERE BOTH THINGS OF THE PAST AND I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOPED TO SEIZE UPON THE TREASURE FIND AND BOARD THE HISPANIOLA UNDER COVER OF NIGHT
THIS ARGUMENT SEEMED WEAK ENOUGH TO ME BUT YOU CAN NEVER TELL WHAT WILL AFFECT THE SUPERSTITIOUS AND TO MY WONDER GEORGE MERRY WAS GREATLY RELIEVED WELL THAT'S SO HE SAID YOU'VE A HEAD UPON YOUR SHOULDERS JOHN AND NO MISTAKE
E S E AND BY E TEN FEET A TALL TREE WAS THUS THE PRINCIPAL MARK NOW RIGHT BEFORE US THE ANCHORAGE WAS BOUNDED BY A PLATEAU FROM TWO TO THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH
THINK IT'LL RIDE ONE OF THE MEN ASKED WHY SHOULDN'T IT CHARLES DEMANDED RATHER SHORTLY OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT THAT'S ALL RIGHT THE MAN HASTENED MEEKLY TO SAY
A HEAVY SCENTED BROOM AND MANY FLOWERING SHRUBS HAD ALMOST TAKEN THE PLACE OF GRASS THICKETS OF GREEN NUTMEG TREES WERE DOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH THE RED COLUMNS AND THE BROAD SHADOW OF THE PINES AND THE FIRST
THE FIRST OF THE TALL TREES WAS REACHED AND BY THE BEARINGS PROVED THE WRONG ONE SO WITH THE SECOND THE THIRD ROSE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FEET INTO THE AIR ABOVE A CLUMP OF UNDERWOOD A GIANT OF A VEGETABLE WITH A RED COLUMN AS BIG AS A COTTAGE
MINGLED THEIR SPICE WITH THE AROMA OF THE OTHERS THE AIR BESIDES WAS FRESH AND STIRRING AND THIS UNDER THE SHEER SUNBEAMS WAS A WONDERFUL REFRESHMENT TO OUR SENSES
AND IT WAS NOW GROWN SO HOT THAT THEY COULD ONLY APPROACH IT FROM THE WINDWARD AND EVEN THERE NOT WITHOUT PRECAUTION IN THE SAME WASTEFUL SPIRIT THEY HAD COOKED I SUPPOSE THREE TIMES MORE THAN WE COULD EAT AND ONE OF THEM WITH AN EMPTY LAUGH
I'M HERE TO GET THAT STUFF AND I'LL NOT BE BEAT BY MAN OR DEVIL I NEVER WAS FEARED OF FLINT IN HIS LIFE AND BY THE POWERS I'LL FACE HIM DEAD
BLANKETS FOR A HOTEL QUOTH ONE OF THE MEN WHO LAUGHED AND HELPED HALF AS MANY IS TOO MUCH GET RID OF THEM THROW AWAY THAT TENT AND ALL THOSE DISHES
RATHER INDEED OF GROWING TERROR AT THE IRREVERENCE OF HIS WORDS BELAY THERE JOHN SAID MERRY DON'T YOU CROSS A SPERRIT AND THE REST WERE ALL TOO TERRIFIED TO REPLY
IT WAS CONSPICUOUS FAR TO SEA BOTH ON THE EAST AND WEST AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENTERED AS A SAILING MARK UPON THE CHART BUT IT WAS NOT ITS SIZE THAT NOW IMPRESSED MY COMPANIONS
THE RED CROSS WAS OF COURSE FAR TOO LARGE TO BE A GUIDE AND THE TERMS OF THE NOTE ON THE BACK AS YOU WILL HEAR
BY THE POWERS BEN GUNN ROARED SILVER AYE
BOUT SHIP MATES THIS HERE CREW IS ON A WRONG TACK I DO BELIEVE AND COME TO THINK ON IT IT WAS LIKE FLINT'S VOICE I GRANT YOU BUT
TWO MEN FROM THE STATES CAME ALONG AND BOUGHT THEM HARNESS AND ALL FOR A SONG THE MEN ADDRESSED EACH OTHER AS HAL AND CHARLES CHARLES WAS A MIDDLE AGED LIGHTISH COLORED MAN WITH WEAK AND WATERY EYES AND A MUSTACHE THAT TWISTED FIERCELY AND VIGOROUSLY UP
ERE WE WERE HALF WAY OVER LONG JOHN ALONE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND BIDDING THEM WAIT TILL THEY WERE THERE WE PULLED EASILY BY SILVER'S DIRECTIONS NOT TO WEARY THE HANDS PREMATURELY AND AFTER QUITE A LONG PASSAGE
THE DOGS NEVER STOPPED THE LIGHTENED SLED BOUNDED ON ITS SIDE BEHIND THEM THEY WERE ANGRY BECAUSE OF THE ILL TREATMENT THEY HAD RECEIVED AND THE UNJUST LOAD BUCK WAS RAGING HE BROKE INTO A RUN THE TEAM FOLLOWING HIS LEAD
WATER WOULD HAVE BEEN LITTLE TO THEIR TASTE A SAILOR IS NOT USUALLY A GOOD SHOT AND BESIDES ALL THAT WHEN THEY WERE SO SHORT OF EATABLES IT WAS NOT LIKELY THEY WOULD BE VERY FLUSH OF POWDER WELL THUS EQUIPPED WE ALL SET OUT EVEN THE FELLOW WITH THE BROKEN HEAD
IT ADVERTISED HIS CALLOWNESS A CALLOWNESS SHEER AND UNUTTERABLE BOTH MEN WERE MANIFESTLY OUT OF PLACE
CAME FROM OUR STOCK AND I COULD SEE THE TRUTH OF SILVER'S WORDS THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD HE NOT STRUCK A BARGAIN WITH THE DOCTOR HE AND HIS MUTINEERS DESERTED BY THE SHIP MUST HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO SUBSIST ON CLEAR WATER AND THE PROCEEDS OF THEIR HUNTING
THREW WHAT WAS LEFT INTO THE FIRE WHICH BLAZED AND ROARED AGAIN OVER THIS UNUSUAL FUEL I NEVER IN MY LIFE SAW MEN SO CARELESS OF THE MORROW HAND TO MOUTH IS THE ONLY WORD THAT CAN DESCRIBE THEIR WAY OF DOING
AFTER TWO EFFORTS THEY STOOD STILL PANTING THE WHIP WAS
NOT FOR A DOZEN CHARLESES SHE APPEALED TO EVERYBODY AND TO EVERYTHING FINALLY WIPING HER EYES AND PROCEEDING TO CAST OUT EVEN ARTICLES OF APPAREL THAT WERE IMPERATIVE NECESSARIES AND IN HER ZEAL WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED WITH HER OWN
THEY WERE UNABLE TO MOVE THE SLED THE LAZY BRUTES I'LL SHOW THEM HE CRIED PREPARING TO LASH OUT AT THEM WITH THE WHIP BUT MERCEDES INTERFERED CRYING OH HAL YOU MUSTN'T
BUT THERE'S ONE THING NOT CLEAR TO ME THERE WAS AN ECHO NOW NO MAN EVER SEEN A SPERRIT WITH A SHADOW WELL THEN WHAT'S HE DOING WITH AN ECHO TO HIM I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT AIN'T IN NATUR SURELY
ADJOINING ON THE NORTH THE SLOPING SOUTHERN SHOULDER OF THE SPY GLASS AND
AND IN THE NATURE OF REASON AND COMMON JUSTICE THEY DESERVED AN INTERVAL OF LOAFING BUT SO MANY WERE THE MEN WHO HAD RUSHED INTO THE KLONDIKE AND SO MANY WERE THE SWEETHEARTS WIVES AND KIN THAT HAD NOT RUSHED IN
THE CAPSIZED SLED GROUND OVER HIM AND THE DOGS DASHED ON UP THE STREET
AND SLOPED STEEPLY INTO THE MAIN STREET IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED AN EXPERIENCED MAN TO KEEP THE TOP HEAVY SLED UPRIGHT AND HAL WAS NOT SUCH A MAN AS THEY SWUNG ON THE TURN THE SLED WENT OVER SPILLING HALF ITS LOAD THROUGH THE LOOSE LASHINGS
WHEN DID EVER A GENTLEMAN O FORTUNE SHOW HIS STERN TO THAT MUCH DOLLARS FOR A BOOZY OLD SEAMAN WITH A BLUE MUG AND HIM DEAD TOO BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF REAWAKENING COURAGE IN HIS FOLLOWERS
AND NOW JIM WE'RE TO GO IN FOR THIS HERE TREASURE HUNTING WITH SEALED ORDERS TOO AND I DON'T LIKE IT AND YOU
NOR NOT NICE SAYS YOU GREAT GUNS MESSMATES BUT IF FLINT WAS LIVING THIS WOULD BE A HOT SPOT FOR YOU AND ME
DICK HAD HIS BIBLE OUT AND WAS PRAYING VOLUBLY HE HAD BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP HAD DICK BEFORE HE CAME TO SEA AND FELL AMONG BAD COMPANIONS STILL SILVER WAS UNCONQUERED I COULD HEAR HIS TEETH RATTLE IN HIS HEAD
BEFORE US WAS A GREAT EXCAVATION NOT VERY RECENT FOR THE SIDES HAD FALLEN IN AND GRASS HAD SPROUTED ON THE BOTTOM IN THIS WERE THE SHAFT OF A PICK BROKEN IN TWO AND THE BOARDS OF SEVERAL PACKING CASES STREWN AROUND
THEY'RE WEAK AS WATER IF YOU WANT TO KNOW CAME THE REPLY FROM ONE OF THE MEN PLUM TUCKERED OUT THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER THEY NEED A REST REST BE BLANKED SAID HAL WITH HIS BEARDLESS LIPS
BOTH WERE TO BE CARRIED ALONG WITH US FOR THE SAKE OF SAFETY AND SO WITH OUR NUMBERS DIVIDED BETWEEN THEM WE SET FORTH UPON THE BOSOM OF THE ANCHORAGE AS WE PULLED OVER THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ON THE CHART
AND YOU'VE GOT TO WHIP THEM TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF THEM THAT'S THEIR WAY YOU ASK ANY ONE ASK ONE OF THOSE MEN MERCEDES LOOKED AT THEM IMPLORINGLY UNTOLD REPUGNANCE AT SIGHT OF PAIN WRITTEN IN HER PRETTY FACE
MERRY WALKING FIRST WITH SILVER'S COMPASS TO KEEP THEM ON THE RIGHT LINE WITH SKELETON ISLAND HE HAD SAID THE TRUTH DEAD OR ALIVE NOBODY MINDED BEN GUNN DICK ALONE STILL HELD HIS BIBLE AND LOOKED AROUND HIM AS HE WENT WITH FEARFUL GLANCES
THE PARTY SPREAD ITSELF ABROAD IN A FAN SHAPE SHOUTING AND LEAPING TO AND FRO ABOUT THE CENTRE AND A GOOD WAY BEHIND THE REST SILVER AND I FOLLOWED I TETHERED BY MY ROPE HE PLOUGHING WITH DEEP PANTS AMONG THE SLIDING GRAVEL FROM TIME TO TIME
HE WERE AN UGLY DEVIL CRIED A THIRD PIRATE WITH A SHUDDER THAT BLUE IN THE FACE TOO THAT WAS HOW THE RUM TOOK HIM ADDED MERRY BLUE WELL I RECKON HE WAS BLUE
SAID HE IT'S LUCKY YOU HAVE BARBECUE TO THINK FOR YOU WITH THIS HERE HEAD I GOT WHAT I WANTED I DID SURE ENOUGH THEY HAVE THE SHIP WHERE THEY HAVE IT I DON'T KNOW YET BUT ONCE WE HIT THE TREASURE
SHE ATTACKED THE BELONGINGS OF HER MEN AND WENT THROUGH THEM LIKE A TORNADO THIS ACCOMPLISHED THE OUTFIT THOUGH CUT IN HALF WAS STILL A FORMIDABLE BULK CHARLES AND HAL WENT OUT IN THE EVENING AND BOUGHT SIX OUTSIDE DOGS
BUT HE HAD NOT YET SURRENDERED NOBODY IN THIS HERE ISLAND EVER HEARD OF DARBY HE MUTTERED NOT ONE BUT US THAT'S HERE AND THEN MAKING A GREAT EFFORT SHIPMATES HE CRIED
KIND HEARTED CITIZENS CAUGHT THE DOGS AND GATHERED UP THE SCATTERED BELONGINGS ALSO THEY GAVE ADVICE HALF THE LOAD AND TWICE THE DOGS
BUCK HEARD THE CHAFFERING SAW THE MONEY PASS BETWEEN THE MAN AND THE GOVERNMENT AGENT AND KNEW THAT THE SCOTCH HALF BREED AND THE MAIL TRAIN DRIVERS WERE PASSING OUT OF HIS LIFE ON THE HEELS OF PERRAULT AND FRANCOIS AND THE OTHERS WHO HAD GONE BEFORE
BEN GUNN'S NOT HERE IN THE BODY ANY MORE'N FLINT BUT THE OLDER HANDS GREETED THIS REMARK WITH SCORN WHY NOBODY MINDS BEN GUNN CRIED MERRY DEAD OR ALIVE NOBODY MINDS HIM
SHE CRIED IN GENERAL AND SHE CRIED IN PARTICULAR OVER EACH DISCARDED THING SHE CLASPED HANDS ABOUT KNEES ROCKING BACK AND FORTH BROKEN HEARTEDLY
THEIR WHOLE SOUL WAS FOUND UP IN THAT FORTUNE THAT WHOLE LIFETIME OF EXTRAVAGANCE AND PLEASURE THAT LAY WAITING THERE FOR EACH OF THEM SILVER HOBBLED GRUNTING ON HIS CRUTCH HIS NOSTRILS STOOD OUT AND QUIVERED
JUST TAKE A BEARING WILL YOU ALONG THE LINE OF THEM BONES IT WAS DONE THE BODY POINTED STRAIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ISLAND AND THE COMPASS READ DULY E S
WHEN DRIVEN WITH HIS MATES TO THE NEW OWNERS CAMP BUCK SAW A SLIPSHOD AND SLOVENLY AFFAIR TENT HALF STRETCHED DISHES UNWASHED EVERYTHING IN DISORDER ALSO HE SAW A WOMAN MERCEDES THE MEN CALLED HER
YOU WOULDN'T LOOK TO FIND A BISHOP HERE I RECKON BUT WHAT SORT OF A WAY IS THAT FOR BONES TO LIE TAIN'T IN NATUR INDEED ON A SECOND GLANCE IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO FANCY THAT THE BODY WAS IN A NATURAL POSITION
THAT THE CONGESTED MAIL WAS TAKING ON ALPINE PROPORTIONS ALSO THERE WERE OFFICIAL ORDERS FRESH BATCHES OF HUDSON BAY DOGS WERE TO TAKE THE PLACES OF THOSE WORTHLESS FOR THE TRAIL THE WORTHLESS ONES WERE TO BE GOT RID OF
BIT OF IT EVERY MUSCLE EVERY FIBRE EVERY CELL WAS TIRED DEAD TIRED AND THERE WAS REASON FOR IT IN LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS THEY HAD TRAVELLED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES
BUT IF EVER SPERRIT WALKED IT WOULD BE FLINT'S DEAR HEART BUT HE DIED BAD DID FLINT AYE THAT HE DID OBSERVED ANOTHER NOW HE RAGED AND NOW HE HOLLERED FOR THE RUM
AND HE DON'T WALK THAT I KNOW LEASTWAYS HE WON'T WALK BY DAY AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT CARE KILLED A CAT FETCH AHEAD FOR THE DOUBLOONS
MUST STICK CLOSE BACK TO BACK LIKE
BUT HE FOUND NO SYMPATHY AND SILVER EVEN JOKED HIM ON HIS PRECAUTIONS I TOLD YOU SAID HE I TOLD YOU YOU HAD SP'ILED YOUR BIBLE
AND WRENCHED IT FROM HIM THE POOR DEARS NOW YOU MUST PROMISE YOU WON'T BE HARSH WITH THEM FOR THE REST OF THE TRIP OR I WON'T GO A STEP PRECIOUS LOT YOU KNOW ABOUT DOGS HER BROTHER SNEERED AND I WISH YOU'D LEAVE ME ALONE THEY'RE LAZY I TELL YOU
WE STARTED CERTAINLY BUT IN SPITE OF THE HOT SUN AND THE STARING DAYLIGHT THE PIRATES NO LONGER RAN SEPARATE AND SHOUTING THROUGH THE WOOD
AND STRAGGLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO THE BEACH WHERE THE TWO GIGS AWAITED US EVEN THESE BORE TRACE OF THE DRUNKEN FOLLY OF THE PIRATES ONE IN A BROKEN THWART AND BOTH IN THEIR MUDDY AND UNBAILED CONDITION
IT WAS MAIN HOT AND THE WINDY WAS OPEN AND I HEAR THAT OLD SONG COMIN OUT AS CLEAR AS CLEAR AND THE DEATH HAUL ON THE MAN ALREADY COME COME SAID SILVER STOW THIS TALK HE'S DEAD
WHEN ONCE MORE MERCEDES INTERFERED SHE DROPPED ON HER KNEES BEFORE BUCK WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AND PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK
BUCK'S ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY POUNDS HAD DWINDLED TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THE REST OF HIS MATES THOUGH LIGHTER DOGS HAD RELATIVELY LOST MORE WEIGHT THAN HE PIKE THE MALINGERER WHO
THE TENT WAS ROLLED INTO AN AWKWARD BUNDLE THREE TIMES AS LARGE AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE TIN DISHES WERE PACKED AWAY UNWASHED MERCEDES CONTINUALLY FLUTTERED IN THE WAY OF HER MEN AND KEPT UP AN UNBROKEN CHATTERING OF REMONSTRANCE AND ADVICE
HAVE SOME BREAD TOASTED AND BUTTERED IN A DEEP DISH AND POUR THE CLAMS OVER CLAM SOUP MAY BE MADE BY PUTTING AN EQUAL QUANTITY OF WATER WITH THE LIQUOR AND PUTTING IN TOASTED BREAD CRACKERS OR DUMPLINGS
IT COULD SCARCELY BE CALLED A TRADE IN SPITE OF HIS FAVOURITE DESCRIPTION OF HIMSELF AS A HONEST TRADESMAN HIS STOCK CONSISTED OF A WOODEN STOOL MADE OUT OF A BROKEN BACKED CHAIR CUT DOWN
THE SHORT RATHER PLUMP WIFE OF A STARVED GROCER AND THE MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN WITHAL THIS LIEUTENANT HAD ALREADY EARNED THE COMPLIMENTARY NAME OF THE VENGEANCE HARK SAID THE VENGEANCE LISTEN THEN WHO COMES
YOU'RE AT IT AGIN ARE YOU AFTER HAILING THE MORN WITH THIS SECOND SALUTATION HE THREW A BOOT AT THE WOMAN AS A THIRD IT WAS A VERY MUDDY BOOT AND MAY INTRODUCE THE ODD CIRCUMSTANCE CONNECTED WITH MISTER CRUNCHER'S DOMESTIC ECONOMY
SET HIS HEAD AND HEART ON PIKES AND CARRIED THE THREE SPOILS OF THE DAY IN WOLF PROCESSION THROUGH THE STREETS
AS PASTE ALWAYS LOOKS MORE BEAUTIFUL WHEN JUST FROM THE OVEN ARRANGE YOUR DINNER SO THAT THE PIE MAY BE PLACED ON THE TABLE IMMEDIATELY IT IS DONE PLAIN OYSTER PIE
ONCE HE WENT ALOFT AND THE ROPE BROKE AND THEY CAUGHT HIM SHRIEKING TWICE HE WENT ALOFT AND THE ROPE BROKE AND THEY CAUGHT HIM SHRIEKING THEN THE ROPE WAS MERCIFUL AND HELD HIM AND HIS HEAD WAS SOON UPON A PIKE
AND KEEP IT BOILING FAST A LARGE FISH WILL TAKE FROM HALF TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR A SMALL ONE FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES A FAT SHAD IS VERY NICE BOILED ALTHOUGH ROCK AND BASS ARE PREFERRED GENERALLY
TAKE OUT THE PAPER OR NAPKIN AND POUR IN THE OYSTERS SEND IT HOT TO TABLE A BALTIMORE OYSTER PIE MAKE A CRUST AFTER THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN FOR PUFF PASTE GREASE THE BOTTOM OF A DEEP DISH
MIX AN EGG IN IT FILL THE FISH WITH THIS AND SEW IT UP OR TIE A STRING ROUND IT PUT IT IN A DEEP PAN OR OVAL OVEN AND BAKE IT AS YOU WOULD A FOWL TO A LARGE FISH ADD HALF A PINT OF WATER
THE JAR OR PAN SHOULD BE OF STONE WARE OR FIRE PROOF YELLOW WARE TO BOIL SALT COD PUT YOUR FISH TO SOAK OVER NIGHT CHANGE THE WATER IN THE MORNING AND LET IT STAY TILL YOU PUT IT ON WHICH SHOULD BE TWO HOURS BEFORE DINNER
AFTERWARDS SUPPING AT THEIR DOORS SCANTY AND INSUFFICIENT SUPPERS THOSE AND INNOCENT OF MEAT AS OF MOST OTHER SAUCE TO WRETCHED BREAD YET HUMAN FELLOWSHIP INFUSED SOME NOURISHMENT INTO THE FLINTY VIANDS
WITH TWO LITTLE COUNTERS WHERE THE OLDEST OF MEN MADE YOUR CHEQUE SHAKE AS IF THE WIND RUSTLED IT WHILE THEY EXAMINED THE SIGNATURE BY THE DINGIEST OF WINDOWS WHICH WERE ALWAYS UNDER A SHOWER BATH OF MUD FROM FLEET STREET
HAD THIS WORK ALWAYS READY FOR IT NOW THAT IT COULD STRIKE THE FINGERS OF THE KNITTING WOMEN WERE VICIOUS WITH THE EXPERIENCE THAT THEY COULD TEAR THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF SAINT ANTOINE THE IMAGE HAD BEEN HAMMERING INTO THIS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
THAT WAS WELL DONE LET HIM EAT IT NOW MADAME PUT HER KNIFE UNDER HER ARM AND CLAPPED HER HANDS AS AT A PLAY THE PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY BEHIND MADAME DEFARGE EXPLAINING THE CAUSE OF HER SATISFACTION TO THOSE BEHIND THEM
EQUAL PARTS OF LARD AND BUTTER DROP IN A SPOONFUL OF THE BATTER AND PUT INTO IT ONE LARGE OYSTER OR TWO SMALL ONES LET THEM BROWN SLOWLY SO AS NOT TO BURN TURN THEM CAREFULLY THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO HAVE OYSTERS AT BREAKFAST
SERVE IT WITH THE GRAVY IN THE DISH A LARGE FISH SHOULD BE ALLOWED AN HOUR SMALL ONES HALF AN HOUR TO BROIL SHAD SOAK A SALT SHAD A DAY OR NIGHT PREVIOUS TO COOKING
IT WAS KNOWN DIRECTLY TO THE FURTHEST CONFINES OF THE CROWD DEFARGE HAD BUT SPRUNG OVER A RAILING AND A TABLE AND FOLDED THE MISERABLE WRETCH IN A DEADLY EMBRACE
WAS TEARING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE ROUSING THE WOMEN THE MEN WERE TERRIBLE IN THE BLOODY MINDED ANGER WITH WHICH THEY LOOKED FROM WINDOWS CAUGHT UP WHAT ARMS THEY HAD AND CAME POURING DOWN INTO THE STREETS BUT THE WOMEN WERE A SIGHT TO CHILL THE BOLDEST
BEAT SIX OR EIGHT EGGS WITH SOME CHOPPED PARSLEY AND A LITTLE SALT HAVE THE PAN OR SPEEDER NICELY WASHED PUT IN A QUARTER OF A POUND OF BUTTER WHEN IT IS HOT POUR IN THE EGGS STIR IT WITH A SPOON TILL IT BEGINS TO FORM
WHILE THE TWINKLING EYES OF THE YOUTHFUL JERRY WERE AS RESTLESSLY WATCHFUL OF HIM AS OF EVERYTHING ELSE IN FLEET STREET THE HEAD OF ONE OF THE REGULAR INDOOR MESSENGERS ATTACHED TO TELLSON'S ESTABLISHMENT WAS PUT THROUGH THE DOOR AND THE WORD WAS GIVEN PORTER WANTED
EH WELL RETURNED MADAME ALMOST SAINT ANTOINE SLEPT THE DEFARGES SLEPT EVEN THE VENGEANCE SLEPT WITH HER STARVED GROCER
FIVE YEARS LATER TELLSON'S BANK BY TEMPLE BAR WAS AN OLD FASHIONED PLACE EVEN IN THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY IT WAS VERY SMALL VERY DARK VERY UGLY VERY INCOMMODIOUS
AND MACE PEPPER AND SALT TO YOUR TASTE LAY A PASTE IN A DEEP DISH PUT IN THE OYSTERS AND COVER THEM WITH PASTE CUT A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE
NOT YOU AND THROWING OFF OTHER SARCASTIC SPARKS FROM THE WHIRLING GRINDSTONE OF HIS INDIGNATION MISTER CRUNCHER BETOOK HIMSELF TO HIS BOOT CLEANING AND HIS GENERAL PREPARATION FOR BUSINESS IN THE MEANTIME HIS SON WHOSE HEAD WAS GARNISHED WITH TENDERER SPIKES
WITH MARVELLOUS QUICKNESS AT A DISTANCE THE MORE READILY BECAUSE CERTAIN MEN WHO HAD BY SOME WONDERFUL EXERCISE OF AGILITY CLIMBED UP THE EXTERNAL ARCHITECTURE TO LOOK IN FROM THE WINDOWS KNEW MADAME DEFARGE WELL AND ACTED AS A TELEGRAPH BETWEEN HER AND THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE BUILDING
THAT THEY MIGHT SEE NOW A LOG OF DEAD WOOD DRAWN THROUGH A FOREST OF LEGS HE WAS HAULED TO THE NEAREST STREET CORNER WHERE ONE OF THE FATAL LAMPS SWUNG AND THERE MADAME DEFARGE LET HIM GO AS A CAT MIGHT HAVE DONE TO A MOUSE
MAKE A THICKENING OF FLOUR AND WATER WHICH STIR IN A FEW MINUTES BEFORE YOU TAKE IT UP WITH TWO GLASSES OF WINE SERVE IT IN A DEEP COVERED DISH PUT IN THE EGGS JUST AS YOU DISH IT OYSTER SOUP
GRATED BREAD SOAKED IN CREAM PUT IN THE OMELET SOME THINK AN IMPROVEMENT THE DRIPPING OF A NICE HAM SOME PERSONS USE FOR OMELET INSTEAD OF BUTTER TO BOIL EGGS HAVE THE WATER BOILING AND LOOK AT YOUR WATCH AS YOU PUT THEM IN
HALF A SMALL TEA SPOONFUL OF SODA WELL MIXED WITH IT AFTER YOU PUT IN THE CREAM PERMIT IT TO REMAIN ON THE FIRE LONG ENOUGH TO ARRIVE AT BOILING HEAT AGAIN WHEN IT MUST BE TAKEN UP OR IT MAY CURDLE THROW INTO THE TUREEN A LITTLE FINELY CUT PARSLEY
HEAT BUTTER IN A FRYING PAN AND AFTER SEASONING THEM WITH PEPPER AND SALT PUT THEM IN SEPARATELY WHEN THEY ARE BROWN ON BOTH SIDES DRAW THEM TO ONE SIDE OF THE PAN STRAIN THE LIQUOR AND PUT IT IN WITH A PIECE OF BUTTER
OR SNOOKS BROTHERS MIGHT BUT TELLSON'S THANK HEAVEN ANY ONE OF THESE PARTNERS WOULD HAVE DISINHERITED HIS SON ON THE QUESTION OF REBUILDING TELLSON'S IN THIS RESPECT THE HOUSE WAS MUCH ON A PAR WITH THE COUNTRY
WHEN DONE TAKE IT UP ON A FISH DISH AND COVER IT WITH EGG SAUCE OR DRAWN BUTTER AND PARSLEY PICKLED MUSHROOMS AND WALNUTS AND MUSHROOM CATSUP ARE GOOD WITH BOILED FISH TO STEW TERRAPINS
IN A RATHER SIGNIFICANT MANNER CRAMPED IN ALL KINDS OF DIM CUPBOARDS AND HUTCHES AT TELLSON'S THE OLDEST OF MEN CARRIED ON THE BUSINESS GRAVELY WHEN THEY TOOK A YOUNG MAN INTO TELLSON'S LONDON HOUSE
AND WHEN COLD COVER THEM WITH VINEGAR TO BROWN OYSTERS IN THEIR OWN JUICE TAKE A QUART OF LARGE OYSTERS WASH THEM IN THEIR OWN JUICE DRAIN AND DIP THEM IN THE YELK OF EGGS
THIS FOULON WAS AT THE HOTEL DE VILLE AND MIGHT BE LOOSED NEVER IF SAINT ANTOINE KNEW HIS OWN SUFFERINGS INSULTS AND WRONGS ARMED MEN AND WOMEN FLOCKED OUT OF THE QUARTER SO FAST AND DREW EVEN THESE LAST DREGS AFTER THEM WITH SUCH A FORCE OF SUCTION
PUT A PIECE OF PAPER DOUBLED OVER IT AND THE LIGHT COLOR WILL BE RETAINED WHEN TAKEN FROM THE OVEN IF IT SHOULD LOOK DRY POUR SOME OF THE LIQUOR THAT WAS DRAINED FROM THE OYSTERS IN THE DISH HAVING PREVIOUSLY STRAINED AND BOILED IT
AND BAKE IT A SHALLOW PIE WILL BAKE IN THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR OYSTER SAUCE PLUMP THE OYSTERS FOR A FEW MINUTES OVER THE FIRE TAKE THEM OUT AND STIR INTO THE LIQUOR SOME FLOUR AND BUTTER MIXED TOGETHER
DIP THEM IN THIS AND FRY THEM IN BUTTER TO STEW CLAMS STRAIN THE LIQUOR AND STEW THEM IN IT FOR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES MAKE A THICKENING OF FLOUR WATER AND PEPPER STIR THIS IN AND LET IT BOIL UP
I KNOW HOW HARD IT HAS GROWN FOR ME THE WEARER OF THIS TO SUPPORT LIFE IN MYSELF BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT HAS GROWN FOR ME THE WEARER OF THIS TO DESTROY LIFE IN YOU EVERY LEAN BARE ARM THAT HAD BEEN WITHOUT WORK BEFORE
THEY KEPT HIM IN A DARK PLACE LIKE A CHEESE UNTIL HE HAD THE FULL TELLSON FLAVOUR AND BLUE MOULD UPON HIM THEN ONLY WAS HE PERMITTED TO BE SEEN
PICK OUT THE LARGEST OYSTERS AND DRAIN THEM SPRINKLE THEM WITH PEPPER AND SALT BEAT UP AN EGG AND DIP THEM FIRST IN IT AND THEN IN POUNDED CRACKERS AND FRY THEM IN BUTTER IT IS A PLAINER WAY TO DIP THEM IN CORN MEAL
SAY THEN MY HUSBAND WHAT IS IT NEWS FROM THE OTHER WORLD HOW THEN CRIED MADAME CONTEMPTUOUSLY THE OTHER WORLD
YOU CAN ADD MORE FOR THE GRAVY IF NECESSARY DUST FLOUR OVER AND BASTE IT WITH BUTTER ANY OTHER FRESH FISH CAN BE BAKED IN THE SAME WAY A LARGE ONE WILL BAKE SLOWLY IN AN HOUR AND A HALF SMALL ONES IN HALF AN HOUR
DEFARGE AND HIS WIFE LOOKED STEADFASTLY AT ONE ANOTHER THE VENGEANCE STOOPED AND THE JAR OF A DRUM WAS HEARD AS SHE MOVED IT AT HER FEET BEHIND THE COUNTER PATRIOTS SAID DEFARGE IN A DETERMINED VOICE ARE WE READY
WHEN IT IS OF A LIGHT BROWN ON THE UNDER SIDE IT IS DONE
AND WHO DIED AND WENT TO HELL EVERYBODY FROM ALL THROATS THE NEWS IS OF HIM HE IS AMONG US AMONG US FROM THE UNIVERSAL THROAT AGAIN AND DEAD NOT DEAD HE FEARED US SO MUCH AND WITH REASON
WHEN THE CRY SEEMED TO GO UP ALL OVER THE CITY BRING HIM OUT BRING HIM TO THE LAMP DOWN AND UP AND HEAD FOREMOST ON THE STEPS OF THE BUILDING NOW ON HIS KNEES NOW ON HIS FEET NOW ON HIS BACK DRAGGED AND STRUCK AT
YOUR PLATE WAS STOWED AWAY AMONG THE NEIGHBOURING CESSPOOLS AND EVIL COMMUNICATIONS CORRUPTED ITS GOOD POLISH IN A DAY OR TWO YOUR DEEDS GOT INTO EXTEMPORISED STRONG ROOMS MADE OF KITCHENS AND SCULLERIES
HE RESENTED MISSUS CRUNCHER'S SAYING GRACE WITH PARTICULAR ANIMOSITY NOW AGGERAWAYTER WHAT ARE YOU UP TO AT IT AGAIN HIS WIFE EXPLAINED THAT SHE HAD MERELY ASKED A BLESSING
COVER IT WITH PASTE THEN SEASON TWO QUARTS OF RAW OYSTERS WITHOUT THE LIQUOR WITH SPICES TO YOUR TASTE SOME PREFERRING NUTMEG MACE CAYENNE PEPPER OTHERS BLACK PEPPER ALONE
SEASON IT WELL WITH SALT AND PEPPER AND A LITTLE MACE OR CLOVES RUB A QUARTER OF A POUND OF BUTTER IN A HALF A TEA CUP OF FLOUR WITH A LITTLE PARSLEY AND THYME STIR THIS IN WITH A PINT OF OYSTERS
THAT WITHIN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THERE WAS NOT A HUMAN CREATURE IN SAINT ANTOINE'S BOSOM BUT A FEW OLD CRONES AND THE WAILING CHILDREN NO THEY WERE ALL BY THAT TIME CHOKING THE HALL OF EXAMINATION
STRAIN THE LIQUOR FROM THE OYSTERS AND PUT IT ON TO BOIL WITH AN EQUAL QUANTITY OF WATER TAKE OFF THE SCUM AS IT RISES PUT IN PEPPER SALT PARSLEY THYME AND BUTTER STIR IN A THICKENING OF FLOUR AND WATER THROW IN THE OYSTERS AND LET THEM SCALD
IT IS BEST TO DRAIN AN HOUR BEFORE YOU PUT IT TO THE FIRE IF IT HANGS LONG EXPOSED TO THE AIR IT LOSES ITS FLAVOR GREASE THE GRIDIRON TO KEEP IT FROM STICKING HAVE GOOD COALS AND PUT THE INSIDE DOWN FIRST
AND ACHIEVING THEM AGAIN IN GOSSIP GRADUALLY THESE STRINGS OF RAGGED PEOPLE SHORTENED AND FRAYED AWAY AND THEN POOR LIGHTS BEGAN TO SHINE IN HIGH WINDOWS AND SLENDER FIRES WERE MADE IN THE STREETS AT WHICH NEIGHBOURS COOKED IN COMMON
ACCORDINGLY THE FORGER WAS PUT TO DEATH THE UTTERER OF A BAD NOTE WAS PUT TO DEATH THE UNLAWFUL OPENER OF A LETTER WAS PUT TO DEATH THE PURLOINER OF FORTY SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE WAS PUT TO DEATH
AND STRUCK SOME SPARKS OF CHEERFULNESS OUT OF THEM FATHERS AND MOTHERS WHO HAD HAD THEIR FULL SHARE IN THE WORST OF THE DAY PLAYED GENTLY WITH THEIR MEAGRE CHILDREN AND LOVERS WITH SUCH A WORLD AROUND THEM AND BEFORE THEM LOVED AND HOPED
OYSTER FRITTERS MAKE A THICK BATTER WITH TWO EGGS SOME CRUMBS OF BREAD AND FLOUR AND A LITTLE MILK SEASON THIS WELL WITH PEPPER AND SALT
OYSTERS PICKLED ANOTHER WAY WASH AND DRAIN THE OYSTERS AND PUT THEM IN SALT AND WATER THAT WILL BEAR AN EGG LET THEM SCALD TILL PLUMP AND PUT THEM IN A GLASS JAR WITH SOME CLOVES AND WHOLE PEPPERS
THE LEAST GOOD IN THE WAY OF PREVENTION IT MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN WORTH REMARKING THAT THE FACT WAS EXACTLY THE REVERSE BUT IT CLEARED OFF AS TO THIS WORLD THE TROUBLE OF EACH PARTICULAR CASE AND LEFT NOTHING ELSE CONNECTED WITH IT TO BE LOOKED AFTER
TELLSON'S THEY SAID WANTED NO ELBOW ROOM TELLSON'S WANTED NO LIGHT TELLSON'S WANTED NO EMBELLISHMENT
BUT INDEED AT THAT TIME PUTTING TO DEATH WAS A RECIPE MUCH IN VOGUE WITH ALL TRADES AND PROFESSIONS AND NOT LEAST OF ALL WITH TELLSON'S DEATH IS NATURE'S REMEDY FOR ALL THINGS AND WHY NOT LEGISLATION'S
WHEN NOT ENGAGED IN MAKING FORAYS THROUGH THE BAR TO INFLICT BODILY AND MENTAL INJURIES OF AN ACUTE DESCRIPTION ON PASSING BOYS WHO WERE SMALL ENOUGH FOR HIS AMIABLE PURPOSE FATHER AND SON EXTREMELY LIKE EACH OTHER
JUST AS IT BOILS STIR IN A THICKENING OF MILK AND FLOUR PUT IN THE OYSTERS AND STIR THEM TILL THEY ARE SUFFICIENTLY STEWED THEN TAKE THEM OFF AND PUT IN THE YELKS OF TWO EGGS WELL BEATEN DO NOT PUT THIS IN WHILE IT IS BOILING OR IT WILL CURDLE
THEN TAKE OUT THE OYSTERS AND PUT TO THEIR OWN LIQUOR A TABLE SPOONFUL OF WHOLE BLACK PEPPER AND A TEA SPOONFUL OF MACE AND CLOVES LET IT BOIL FIVE MINUTES SKIM AND POUR IT OVER THE OYSTERS IN A JAR
PUT A PLATE OVER THE TOP OF THE JAR AND SET IT IN A MODERATELY WARM OVEN OR ON THE TOP OF A STOVE IN A PAN OF HOT WATER FOR FIVE OR SIX HOURS THEY WILL KEEP IN A COOL PLACE SEVERAL WEEKS AND ARE AN EXCELLENT RELISH
AND WHOSE YOUNG EYES STOOD CLOSE BY ONE ANOTHER AS HIS FATHER'S DID KEPT THE REQUIRED WATCH UPON HIS MOTHER HE GREATLY DISTURBED THAT POOR WOMAN AT INTERVALS BY DARTING OUT OF HIS SLEEPING CLOSET WHERE HE MADE HIS TOILET WITH A SUPPRESSED CRY OF YOU ARE GOING TO FLOP MOTHER HALLOA FATHER
I WAS NOT PRAYING AGAINST YOU I WAS PRAYING FOR YOU YOU WEREN'T AND IF YOU WERE I WON'T BE TOOK THE LIBERTY WITH HERE
INSTANTLY MADAME DEFARGE'S KNIFE WAS IN HER GIRDLE THE DRUM WAS BEATING IN THE STREETS AS IF IT AND A DRUMMER HAD FLOWN TOGETHER BY MAGIC AND THE VENGEANCE UTTERING TERRIFIC SHRIEKS AND FLINGING HER ARMS ABOUT HER HEAD LIKE ALL THE FORTY FURIES AT ONCE
COULD HAVE WAKENED HIM UP AND HAD THE SAME SPEECH OUT OF HIM AS BEFORE THE BASTILLE FELL OR OLD FOULON WAS SEIZED
DIRECTLY DOWN UPON THE OLD PRISONER'S HEAD THE FAVOUR WAS TOO MUCH TO BEAR IN AN INSTANT THE BARRIER OF DUST AND CHAFF THAT HAD STOOD SURPRISINGLY LONG WENT TO THE WINDS AND SAINT ANTOINE HAD GOT HIM
ENCAMPED AT A QUARTER BEFORE NINE IN GOOD TIME TO TOUCH HIS THREE CORNERED HAT TO THE OLDEST OF MEN AS THEY PASSED IN TO TELLSON'S JERRY TOOK UP HIS STATION ON THIS WINDY MARCH MORNING WITH YOUNG JERRY STANDING BY HIM

AND SILENTLY AND COMPOSEDLY LOOKED AT HIM WHILE THEY MADE READY AND WHILE HE BESOUGHT HER THE WOMEN PASSIONATELY SCREECHING AT HIM ALL THE TIME AND THE MEN STERNLY CALLING OUT TO HAVE HIM KILLED WITH GRASS IN HIS MOUTH
THUS IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT TELLSON'S WAS THE TRIUMPHANT PERFECTION OF INCONVENIENCE AFTER BURSTING OPEN A DOOR OF IDIOTIC OBSTINACY WITH A WEAK RATTLE IN ITS THROAT
THAT WHEREAS HE OFTEN CAME HOME AFTER BANKING HOURS WITH CLEAN BOOTS HE OFTEN GOT UP NEXT MORNING TO FIND THE SAME BOOTS COVERED WITH CLAY WHAT SAID MISTER CRUNCHER VARYING HIS APOSTROPHE AFTER MISSING HIS MARK WHAT ARE YOU UP TO AGGERAWAYTER
CUT SLITS IN THE SIDES OF EACH SEASON THEM WITH SALT AND PEPPER AND ROLL THEM IN CORN FLOUR HAVE IN YOUR FRYING PAN HOT LARD OR BACON DRIPPINGS IF THE FISH HAVE BEEN KEPT SEVERAL DAYS DIP THEM IN EGG BEFORE ROLLING THEM IN CORN FLOUR

PARTICLES OF WHICH FLEW UP YOUR NOSE AND DOWN YOUR THROAT WHEN THEY WERE OPENED AND SHUT YOUR BANK NOTES HAD A MUSTY ODOUR AS IF THEY WERE FAST DECOMPOSING INTO RAGS AGAIN
IT FORMED THE ENCAMPMENT FOR THE DAY ON THIS POST OF HIS MISTER CRUNCHER WAS AS WELL KNOWN TO FLEET STREET AND THE TEMPLE AS THE BAR ITSELF
AND WHICH WERE MADE THE DINGIER BY THEIR OWN IRON BARS PROPER AND THE HEAVY SHADOW OF TEMPLE BAR IF YOUR BUSINESS NECESSITATED YOUR SEEING THE HOUSE YOU WERE PUT INTO A SPECIES OF CONDEMNED HOLD AT THE BACK
LISTEN EVERYWHERE SAID MADAME AGAIN LISTEN TO HIM DEFARGE STOOD PANTING AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF EAGER EYES AND OPEN MOUTHS FORMED OUTSIDE THE DOOR ALL THOSE WITHIN THE WINE SHOP HAD SPRUNG TO THEIR FEET
OUTSIDE TELLSON'S NEVER BY ANY MEANS IN IT UNLESS CALLED IN WAS AN ODD JOB MAN AN OCCASIONAL PORTER AND MESSENGER WHO SERVED AS THE LIVE SIGN OF THE HOUSE HE WAS NEVER ABSENT DURING BUSINESS HOURS UNLESS UPON AN ERRAND
FRESH SHAD IS BETTER TO BE SPRINKLED WITH SALT AN HOUR BEFORE IT IS PUT TO BROIL PUT A PLATE OVER THE TOP TO KEEP THE HEAT IN IN BROILING SHAD OR OTHER FRESH FISH YOU SHOULD DUST THEM WITH CORN MEAL BEFORE YOU PUT THEM DOWN TO BAKE A FRESH SHAD
WITH THE WILDEST CRIES AND ACTIONS VILLAIN FOULON TAKEN MY SISTER OLD FOULON TAKEN MY MOTHER MISCREANT FOULON TAKEN MY DAUGHTER
THEN PUT IN SIX LARGE BLADES OF MACE A LITTLE CAYENNE AND BLACK OR WHITE PEPPER THE LATTER ON ACCOUNT OF THE COLOR IS PREFERABLE AS IT IS DESIRABLE TO HAVE THE SOUP AS WHITE AS POSSIBLE
POUR YOUR OYSTERS INTO THE DISH AND SEASON TO YOUR TASTE WITH BUTTER PEPPER AND SALT ADDING MACE OR CLOVES CRUMB BREAD ON THE TOP OF THE OYSTERS AND BAKE IT WITH A QUICK HEAT ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES TO FRY OYSTERS
GROWLING OVER IT LIKE ANY FOUR FOOTED INMATE OF A MENAGERIE TOWARDS NINE O'CLOCK HE SMOOTHED HIS RUFFLED ASPECT AND PRESENTING AS RESPECTABLE AND BUSINESS LIKE AN EXTERIOR AS HE COULD OVERLAY HIS NATURAL SELF WITH ISSUED FORTH TO THE OCCUPATION OF THE DAY
MISTER CRUNCHER HIMSELF ALWAYS SPOKE OF THE YEAR OF OUR LORD AS ANNA DOMINOES APPARENTLY UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE CHRISTIAN ERA DATED FROM THE INVENTION OF A POPULAR GAME BY A LADY WHO HAD BESTOWED HER NAME UPON IT
AND THE LAST FINISHING BLOWS HAD TOLD MIGHTILY ON THE EXPRESSION MADAME DEFARGE SAT OBSERVING IT WITH SUCH SUPPRESSED APPROVAL AS WAS TO BE DESIRED IN THE LEADER OF THE SAINT ANTOINE WOMEN ONE OF HER SISTERHOOD KNITTED BESIDE HER
BOOK THE SECOND THE GOLDEN THREAD
LET THEM REMAIN TILL THE WHITE IS SET AND TAKE THEM OUT WITH AN EGG SPOON AND PUT ON A DISH THAT HAS BUTTERED TOAST ON IT FRIED EGGS SLICE AND FRY ANY KIND OF BACON DISH IT
WHEN THEY ARE DONE TAKE THEM UP IN A DEEP COVERED DISH WITH BUTTERED TOAST IN THE BOTTOM A RICH OYSTER PIE STRAIN OFF THE LIQUOR FROM THE OYSTERS AND PUT IT ON TO BOIL WITH SOME BUTTER MACE NUTMEG PEPPER AND SALT
LOOKING SILENTLY ON AT THE MORNING TRAFFIC IN FLEET STREET WITH THEIR TWO HEADS AS NEAR TO ONE ANOTHER AS THE TWO EYES OF EACH WERE BORE A CONSIDERABLE RESEMBLANCE TO A PAIR OF MONKEYS THE RESEMBLANCE WAS NOT LESSENED BY THE ACCIDENTAL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE MATURE JERRY BIT AND SPAT OUT STRAW
HAVE THE EGGS READY IN A DISH AND POUR THEM INTO THE GRAVY WHEN DONE TAKE THEM UP AND LAY THEM ON THE MEAT FRIED EGGS ANOTHER WAY HAVE YOUR LARD OR BUTTER BOILING HOT BREAK IN ONE EGG AT A TIME
AT FIRST HE SLEPT HEAVILY BUT BY DEGREES BEGAN TO ROLL AND SURGE IN BED UNTIL HE ROSE ABOVE THE SURFACE WITH HIS SPIKY HAIR LOOKING AS IF IT MUST TEAR THE SHEETS TO RIBBONS AT WHICH JUNCTURE HE EXCLAIMED IN A VOICE OF DIRE EXASPERATION
LET SALMON SOAK OVER NIGHT AND BOIL IT SLOWLY FOR TWO HOURS EAT IT WITH DRAWN BUTTER TO PICKLE SALMON AFTER IT HAS BEEN BOILED HEAT VINEGAR SCALDING HOT WITH WHOLE PEPPERS AND CLOVES CUT THE FISH IN SMALL SQUARE PIECES
AND FLOUR ENOUGH TO THICKEN IT A DISH OF POACHED EGGS HAVE READY A KETTLE OF BOILING WATER POUR IT IN A PAN OR SPEEDER WHICH IS SET ON COALS HAVE THE EGGS AT HAND
MADAME DEFARGE HAD BUT FOLLOWED AND TURNED HER HAND IN ONE OF THE ROPES WITH WHICH HE WAS TIED THE VENGEANCE AND JACQUES THREE WERE NOT YET UP WITH THEM AND THE MEN AT THE WINDOWS HAD NOT YET SWOOPED INTO THE HALL LIKE BIRDS OF PREY FROM THEIR HIGH PERCHES
TO STEW OYSTERS OPEN THEM AND THROW THEM IN A STEW PAN WITH A LUMP OF BUTTER MAKE A THICKENING OF FLOUR AND WATER SALT AND PEPPER AND STIR IT IN JUST AS THE OYSTERS BOIL
THE ROOM IN WHICH HE LAY ABED WAS ALREADY SCRUBBED THROUGHOUT AND BETWEEN THE CUPS AND SAUCERS ARRANGED FOR BREAKFAST AND THE LUMBERING DEAL TABLE A VERY CLEAN WHITE CLOTH WAS SPREAD MISTER CRUNCHER REPOSED UNDER A PATCHWORK COUNTERPANE LIKE A HARLEQUIN AT HOME
AFTERWARDS PERMIT ALL TO BOIL TOGETHER ABOUT FIVE MINUTES THEN POUR IN THE OYSTERS AND A QUARTER OF A POUND OF BUTTER INTO WHICH A DESSERT SPOONFUL OF WHEAT FLOUR HAS BEEN RUBBED FINE KEEP THIS AT BOILING HEAT UNTIL THE OYSTERS BEGIN TO LOOK PLUMP
DON'T DO IT SAID MISTER CRUNCHES LOOKING ABOUT AS IF HE RATHER EXPECTED TO SEE THE LOAF DISAPPEAR UNDER THE EFFICACY OF HIS WIFE'S PETITIONS
YOU'VE GOT A DUTIFUL MOTHER YOU HAVE MY SON YOU'VE GOT A RELIGIOUS MOTHER YOU HAVE MY BOY GOING AND FLOPPING HERSELF DOWN AND PRAYING THAT THE BREAD AND BUTTER MAY BE SNATCHED OUT OF THE MOUTH OF HER ONLY CHILD MASTER CRUNCHER WHO WAS IN HIS SHIRT TOOK THIS VERY ILL
IN BOTH THERE WERE SEVERAL KNOTS OF LOUNGERS SQUALID AND MISERABLE BUT NOW WITH A MANIFEST SENSE OF POWER ENTHRONED ON THEIR DISTRESS THE RAGGEDEST NIGHTCAP AWRY ON THE WRETCHEDEST HEAD HAD THIS CROOKED SIGNIFICANCE IN IT
IT WAS AN OLD FASHIONED PLACE MOREOVER IN THE MORAL ATTRIBUTE THAT THE PARTNERS IN THE HOUSE WERE PROUD OF ITS SMALLNESS PROUD OF ITS DARKNESS PROUD OF ITS UGLINESS PROUD OF ITS INCOMMODIOUSNESS
THUS TELLSON'S IN ITS DAY LIKE GREATER PLACES OF BUSINESS ITS CONTEMPORARIES HAD TAKEN SO MANY LIVES THAT IF THE HEADS LAID LOW BEFORE IT HAD BEEN RANGED ON TEMPLE BAR INSTEAD OF BEING PRIVATELY DISPOSED OF
WHERE YOU MEDITATED ON A MISSPENT LIFE UNTIL THE HOUSE CAME WITH ITS HANDS IN ITS POCKETS AND YOU COULD HARDLY BLINK AT IT IN THE DISMAL TWILIGHT YOUR MONEY CAME OUT OF OR WENT INTO WORMY OLD WOODEN DRAWERS
TRIED TO LOOK AS THOUGH SHE SCARCELY TOUCHED THE FLOOR AND EVIDENTLY FELT HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT ON EARTH NOT AT THE LOCAL CLUB BUT SOMEWHERE FAR FAR AWAY IN THE CLOUDS
I WILL DIE BEFORE THAT DAY EVER COMES TO SEPARATE ME FROM THE MAN I LOVE AND THE CHILD WHO CALLS ME MOTHER YOU MAY FORCE ME FROM THIS HOUSE YOU MAY PLUNGE ME INTO POVERTY INTO CONTUMELY
HE RECALLED THE LOOK OF BEATITUDE WHICH HAD SO IRRITATED HIM AT THE CLUB AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE BEATITUDE WAS GONE FILLED HIS SOUL WITH TRIUMPH HE WAS PLEASED AND SATISFIED AND AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THE LACK OF SOMETHING
BUT I HAVE LOVED MISS OLYMPIA AS WE USED TO CALL HER
ALL THAT SURPRISED ME THE POLICE WERE WATCHING ME EVERY DAY AS A CAT WATCHES A MOUSE AND THOUGHT THAT THEY SURELY HAD GOT THE THIEF WHEN THEY FOUND THAT I HAD DEALINGS WITH BENJAMIN WELL YOU YOU WERE LAUGHING AT ME IN YOUR SLEEVE ALL THE TIME
TILL THIS MATTER CAN BE LEGALLY SETTLED I DO NOT WISH TO MAKE MYSELF HATEFUL TO HER FOR I ANTICIPATE THE DAY WHEN SHE WILL BE MY WIFE IN HEART AS SHE IS NOW IN LAW NEVER THE WORD RANG OUT IN TRUE WOMANLY REVOLT
GOOD BYE MY DEAR GOOD BYE SAID LIZZIE HE TOOK HER HAND IN ONE OF HIS PATTED HER ON THE HEAD WITH THE OTHER AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A CHILD
AND LISTENED GREEDILY TO THE BAND PLAYING THE MARCH LOOKING AT THEIR PALE ECSTATIC FACES ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THOSE STRAINS CAME FROM SOME HEAVENLY CHOIR
YOU SEE WE HAVE ALL OF US BEEN MADE REMARKABLE HAVEN'T WE YOU ARE ALWAYS REMARKABLE LORD GEORGE
SHE FELT ASHAMED THAT SHE HAD SUCH A SICKLY LOOKING ILL HUMOURED ORDINARY HUSBAND LET US GO HOME REPEATED THE TAX COLLECTOR WHY IT'S QUITE EARLY I BEG YOU TO COME HOME SAID THE TAX COLLECTOR DELIBERATELY
SO THAT ALL MIGHT KNOW HOW STALE AND WORTHLESS LIFE IS WHEN YOU WALK ALONG THE STREETS IN THE DARK AND HEAR THE SLUSH OF THE MUD UNDER YOUR FEET AND WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU WILL WAKE UP NEXT MORNING WITH NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO BUT VODKA AND CARDS OH HOW AWFUL IT IS
YOU ARE NO MORE THAN A CHILD TO ME BUT YOU HAVE SURPRISED ME I HOPE I HAVE NOT INJURED YOU LORD GEORGE DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU RODE TO HOUNDS THE DAY YOUR COUSIN TOOK THAT OTHER MAN'S HORSE THAT SURPRISED ME
MISSUS CARBUNCLE HAD COME PRETTY NEARLY TO THE END OF HER CAREER WHEREAS LIZZIE'S INCOME IN SPITE OF HER PERJURIES WAS COMPARATIVELY UNTOUCHED THE UNDOUBTED MISTRESS OF PORTRAY CASTLE
MY POLITICAL PRINCIPLES OH THE IRONY OF HIS VOICE THE TRIUMPH IN HIS LAUGH AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THEM
HE FALTERED TO HIS FEET AGAIN SAYING HUMBLY AS HE CREPT AWAY I COULDN'T HELP IT YOUR HONOR
LIZZIE PRICKED UP HER EARS IN SPITE OF ALL HIS HARSHNESS COULD IT BE THAT HE SHOULD BE THE CORSAIR STILL
FIVE OF THEM DEVOTED TO GRIEF FOR HER LOSS AND TWO TO RAGE AND BITTER REVULSION AGAINST HER WHOLE SEX WHEN I FOUND HER ALIVE AND MYSELF THE DESPISED VICTIM OF HER DECEPTION SHE WRONGED YOU SHE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
AND ACCEPTING THE PROTECTION OF THE MAN WHOSE NAME IS REALLY HERS GO FROM THIS HOUSE AT ONCE AT THIS ALTERNATIVE UTTERED WITH ICY DELIBERATION MISSUS PACKARD RECOILED WITH A SHARP CRY
AND HIS TONE GREW IN SEVERITY AND ASSURANCE YOU HAVE KNOWN FOR TWO YEARS THAT THIS WOMAN WHOM YOU CALLED YOURS WAS WITHIN YOUR REACH IF NOT UNDER YOUR VERY EYE AND YOU FORBORE TO CLAIM HER
FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING TO YOU THAT SURPRISED ME I MEANT TO BE SO KIND TO YOU ALL AND WHEN I FOUND THAT YOU ALWAYS TRAVELLED WITH TEN THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF DIAMONDS IN A BOX THAT SURPRISED ME VERY MUCH
WE HAVE ALL HAD AN EXPERIENCE SAID LORD GEORGE STILL LOOKING AT HER WITH THAT HALF COMIC TURN OF HIS FACE
ONLY TWO CONSIDERATIONS COULD HOLD BACK A MAN LIKE YOU FROM URGING A CLAIM HE REGARDED AS A SACRED RIGHT THE FACT OF A FORMER MARRIAGE OR THE REMEMBRANCE OF A FORFEITED CITIZENSHIP
A NARROW SPITEFUL SOUL GIVEN TO DRINK WITH A BIG CLOSELY CROPPED HEAD AND THICK PROTRUDING LIPS
THAT LIFE WAS BY NO MEANS SO DELIGHTFUL AS SHE FANCIED NOW IN HER EXCITEMENT YOU WAIT I'LL TEACH YOU TO SMILE SO BLISSFULLY HE MUTTERED YOU ARE NOT A BOARDING SCHOOL MISS YOU ARE NOT A GIRL AN OLD FRIGHT OUGHT TO REALISE SHE IS A FRIGHT
OF IRRESISTIBLE PASSION TRUE YES IT IS TRUE BUT WHAT DOES THAT TRUTH INVOLVE FOR ME NOT TWO WEEKS
AND SWORN EVER SO MANY FALSE OATHS AND HAVE BROUGHT ALL YOUR FRIENDS INTO TROUBLE AND HAVE GOT NOTHING BY IT WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF BEING SO CLEVER YOU NEED NOT COME HERE TO TEASE ME LORD GEORGE I CAME HERE BECAUSE YOU SENT FOR ME
THEN YOU ARE A VILLAIN AND I SHALL NOT FEEL MYSELF CALLED UPON TO SHOW YOU ANY CONSIDERATION BEYOND WHAT JUSTICE DEMANDS HAVE YOU ANY PLEA TO URGE BEYOND THE NATURAL ONE OF HER SEEMINGLY UNPROVOKED DESERTION OF YOU HAS NOT MY WIFE
LIZZIE IN SENDING TO HIM HAD SOME HALF FORMED IDEA OF A ROMANTIC FAREWELL THE MAN SHE THOUGHT HAD BEHAVED VERY BADLY TO HER HAD ACCEPTED VERY MUCH FROM HER HANDS AND HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HER ANYTHING IN RETURN
THAT YOUR WORK IS A TRAITOR'S WORK THAT THE GLORIFICATION YOU SPEAK OF IS FALSE THAT YOU MAY TALK IN MY FAVOR
AND NEVER DOUBTING THAT HER HUSBAND WAS TO BE A PRINCE OR AT THE WORST A BARON THE TAX COLLECTOR WATCHED SCOWLING WITH SPITE IT WAS NOT JEALOUSY HE WAS FEELING HE WAS ILL HUMOURED FIRST BECAUSE THE ROOM WAS TAKEN UP WITH DANCING
I'M NOT A MAN TO STAND ON TRIFLES BUT BY GEORGE IT WOULDN'T DO THEN WHO WANTED IT TO DO SAID LIZZIE GO AWAY YOU ARE VERY UNKIND TO ME I HOPE I MAY NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN
HE WAS NOW SILENT BUT STILL LOOKING DOWN UPON HER AS HE STOOD MOTIONLESS UPON THE RUG SO THAT SHE WAS COMPELLED TO SPEAK AGAIN I SENT FOR YOU LORD GEORGE BECAUSE I DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF PARTING WITH YOU FOR EVER WITHOUT ONE WORD OF ADIEU
THEIR FATHERS AND HUSBANDS FORCED TEMPORARILY INTO THE BACKGROUND CROWDED ROUND THE MEAGRE REFRESHMENT TABLE IN THE ENTRANCE HALL ALL THESE GOVERNMENT CASHIERS SECRETARIES CLERKS AND SUPERINTENDENTS STALE SICKLY LOOKING CLUMSY FIGURES
THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THAT SHE HATED HIM SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET UP SOME SHOW OF AN AFFECTIONATE FAREWELL SOME SCENE IN WHICH THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEARS AND TENDERNESS AND POETRY AND PERHAPS A PARTING CARESS BUT WITH HIS JEERING WORDS AND SNEERING FACE HE WAS AS HARD TO HER AS A ROCK
THE TAX COLLECTOR SAW THE LOOK OF BEATITUDE GRADUALLY VANISH FROM HIS WIFE'S FACE SAW HOW ASHAMED AND MISERABLE SHE WAS AND HE FELT A LITTLE HAPPIER WHY DO YOU WANT ME AT ONCE ASKED HIS WIFE I DON'T WANT YOU
ON HEARING THIS LIZZIE SMILED BUT DID NOT SAY A WORD THEN I PERCEIVED THAT I
AND SHE MUST POWDER HER FACE AND LACE HERSELF UP AND FRIZZING HER HAIR FLIRTING AND MAKING FACES AND FANCYING SHE'S DOING THE THING IN STYLE
AND IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FORCEFUL MEN AS WELL AS THE EXTREME NATURE OF THE CONFLICT THAT BOTH WERE QUIET IN MANNER AND SPEECH PERHAPS THE MAYOR THE MORE SO AS HE BEGAN THE STRUGGLE BY SAYING
OR BETTER PROSPECTS OFFERED THE CIPHER AND THE DESIRABILITY YOU EXPRESSED OF A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION UNREADABLE SAVE BY YOU TWO ALL THIS WAS ENOUGH TO START THE SUSPICION YOUR OWN MANNER HAS DONE THE REST
WERE THE PROPERTY OF MISS ROANOKE HAVING BEEN MADE OVER TO HER UNCONDITIONALLY LONG BEFORE THE WEDDING AS A PART OF A SEPARATE PECUNIARY TRANSACTION MISSUS CARBUNCLE HAD NO POWER OF DISPOSING OF MISS ROANOKE'S PROPERTY
THE INNS AND RESTAURANTS KEEP OPEN ALL NIGHT THE MILITARY COMMANDANT HIS SECRETARY AND THE LOCAL GARRISON PUT ON THEIR BEST UNIFORMS THE POLICE FLIT TO AND FRO LIKE MAD WHILE THE EFFECT ON THE LADIES IS BEYOND ALL DESCRIPTION
WITH A SPITEFUL EXPRESSION WHY HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED ANNA PAVLOVNA ASKED IN A FLUTTER NOTHING HAS HAPPENED BUT I WISH YOU TO GO HOME AT ONCE I WISH IT THAT'S ENOUGH AND WITHOUT FURTHER TALK PLEASE
AND ALL I'M SORRY FOR
A MAN OF TWENTY FIVE IS OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE A RECORD MISTER STEELE THE MAYOR'S TONE HARDENED SO DID HIS MANNER
BUT IT IS A FACULTY WHICH SHOULD HAVE MADE YOU PAUSE BEFORE YOU TRUSTED ME WITH THE FURTHERANCE AND FINAL SUCCESS OF A CAMPAIGN WHICH MAY OUTLAST THOSE EXIGENCIES I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN OF YOUR PARTY I AM NOT SO NOW AT HEART
OF COURSE NOT WHERE DO WE POOR COUNTRY BUMPKINS COME IN SNEERED THE TAX COLLECTOR WE ARE AT A DISCOUNT NOW WE'RE CLUMSY SEALS UNPOLISHED PROVINCIAL BEARS AND SHE'S THE QUEEN OF THE BALL
MISSUS CARBUNCLE WOULD DECLINE TO PAY IT AS SHE WAS INFORMED THAT ALL MONEYS POSSESSED BY LADY EUSTACE WERE NOW CONFISCATED TO THE CROWN BY REASON OF THE PERJURIES THE WORD WAS DOUBLY SCORED IN MISSUS CARBUNCLE'S NOTE WHICH LADY EUSTACE HAD COMMITTED
SPRANG IN AND SEIZED UPON THE OTHER WITH A VIOLENCE OF PASSION
THE NOBILITY WITH WHICH HE EMPHASIZED THOSE TWO WORDS MADE MY HEART SWELL SPOKEN THE TRUTH AH THEN THE MASK OF DISDAINFUL SERENITY WITH WHICH THE OTHER HAD HITHERTO VEILED THE BURNING ANGUISH OF HIS SOUL FELL IN ONE BURST
LIZZIE MIGHT HAVE SAVED HERSELF THE TROUBLE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO HER TO INSULT HER LATE FRIEND EVEN THOUGH IN DOING SO NEW INSULTS WERE HEAPED UPON HER OWN HEAD AS FOR THE TRUMPERY SPOONS THEY SO SAID MISSUS CARBUNCLE
WHY GO HOME WHY IT'S NOT ELEVEN O'CLOCK I WISH IT AND THAT'S ENOUGH COME ALONG AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT IT DON'T BE SILLY GO HOME ALONE IF YOU WANT TO ALL RIGHT THEN I SHALL MAKE A SCENE
COULD STILL DESPISE AND LOOK DOWN UPON MISSUS CARBUNCLE
JUST TO FEED YOUR REVENGE YES I WOULD DO THAT JEOPARDIZE INTERESTS YOU HAVE SO OFTEN PROFESSED IN MY HEARING TO BE FAR ABOVE PERSONAL CONSIDERATION THE SUCCESS OF YOUR PARTY THE TRIUMPH OF YOUR POLITICAL PRINCIPLES
PETTY FEELINGS OF ENVY VEXATION WOUNDED VANITY OF THAT SMALL PROVINCIAL MISANTHROPY ENGENDERED IN PETTY OFFICIALS BY VODKA AND A SEDENTARY LIFE SWARMED IN HIS HEART LIKE MICE WAITING FOR THE END OF THE MAZURKA
THERE WAS A TIME YOU KNOW WHEN EVEN COUSIN FRANK WASN'T A BETTER FELLOW THAN MYSELF MUCH YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT LORD GEORGE WELL I DID I THOUGHT ABOUT IT A GOOD DEAL MY LADY AND I LIKED THE IDEA OF IT VERY MUCH
I LOOKED TO SEE THE MAYOR SPRING AND GRASP HIM BY THE THROAT BUT THAT WAS LEFT FOR ANOTHER HAND AS THE SECRETARY BENT TO TOUCH THE DOOR IT SUDDENLY FLEW VIOLENTLY OPEN AND NIXON QUIVERING IN EVERY LIMB AND WITH HIS FACE AFIRE
HAD BECOME THE FIRST DEPOSITORY OF HER GREAT SECRET AND HAD PLACED NO MUTUAL CONFIDENCE IN HER HE HAD BEEN HARSH TO HER AND UNJUST AND THEN TOO HE HAD DECLINED TO BE IN LOVE WITH HER SHE WAS FULL OF SPITE AGAINST LORD GEORGE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO INJURE HIM
HAD THERE BEEN ANY DEVOTION BUT LORD GEORGE WAS BOTH IMPUDENT AND INDIFFERENT YES SHE SAID THANK GOODNESS I SHALL GET OUT OF THIS FRIGHTFUL PLACE TO MORROW AND SOON HAVE ONCE MORE A ROOF OF MY OWN OVER MY HEAD
HE WENT INTO THE HALL AND WALKED UP TO HIS WIFE ANNA PAVLOVNA WAS SITTING WITH HER PARTNER AND FLIRTING HER FAN AND COQUETTISHLY DROPPING HER EYELIDS WAS DESCRIBING HOW SHE USED TO DANCE IN PETERSBURG HER LIPS WERE PURSED UP LIKE A ROSEBUD AND SHE PRONOUNCED
AND THERE WAS NOWHERE HE COULD PLAY A GAME OF CARDS SECONDLY BECAUSE HE COULD NOT ENDURE THE SOUND OF WIND INSTRUMENTS AND THIRDLY BECAUSE HE FANCIED THE OFFICERS TREATED THE CIVILIANS SOMEWHAT TOO CASUALLY AND DISDAINFULLY
YOU ARE PRETTY YOU KNOW UNCOMMONLY PRETTY DON'T LORD GEORGE AND I'LL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE INCOME GOES FOR MUCH I SUPPOSE THAT'S REAL AT ANY RATE WELL I HOPE SO OF COURSE IT'S REAL
THE MAYOR GAVE NO EVIDENCE OF FEELING EITHER ITS FORCE OR ASSUMPTION
WHEN A POCK MARKED SOLDIER IN A RED SHIRT DARTED PAST THE WINDOWS THEY KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS LIEUTENANT RYMZOV'S ORDERLY RUNNING ABOUT THE TOWN TRYING TO GET SOME ENGLISH BITTER ALE ON TICK FOR HIS MASTER
UNFORTUNATELY YOU DIDN'T BUT I THOUGHT YOU DID AND YOU THOUGHT THAT I HAD DONE IT MISTER BENJAMIN WAS TOO CLEVER FOR US BOTH AND NOW HE IS GOING TO HAVE PENAL SERVITUDE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE I WONDER WHO WILL BE THE BETTER OF IT ALL
THIS WOMAN WHO HAS GONE THROUGH THE CEREMONY OF MARRIAGE WITH BOTH OF US SHALL NEVER KNOW TO WHICH OF US SHE IS THE LEGAL WIFE PERHAPS IT IS AS GOOD A REVENGE AS THE OTHER IT CERTAINLY WILL INTERFERE AS MUCH WITH HER PEACE OH OH NOT THAT I CAN NOT BEAR THAT
I WOULDN'T MIND IT SO MUCH IF ANYBODY WERE THE BETTER FOR IT
THEY'D NOT OBJECT TO MAKING LOVE TO HER I DARE SAY DURING THE MAZURKA THE TAX COLLECTOR'S FACE TWITCHED WITH SPITE A BLACK HAIRED OFFICER WITH PROMINENT EYES AND TARTAR CHEEKBONES DANCED THE MAZURKA WITH ANNA PAVLOVNA
SHE FELT MISERABLE INSULTED AND CHOKING WITH HATE AS SHE LISTENED TO HER HUSBAND'S HEAVY FOOTSTEPS SHE WAS SILENT TRYING TO THINK OF THE MOST OFFENSIVE BITING AND VENOMOUS WORD SHE COULD HURL AT HER HUSBAND
YET THE IMPRESSION MADE BY HIS LOOK AND ATTITUDE WERE NOT THE SAME THE FIRE HAD GONE OUT OF THEM A BLIGHT HAD STRUCK HIS SOUL THE FLUSH OF HIS TRIUMPH WAS GONE MAYOR PACKARD WAS MERCILESS
BECAUSE I'M BAD AND ONLY A NEW FRIEND
ASSUMING A STERN EXPRESSION HE WORKED HIS LEGS WITH GRAVITY AND FEELING AND SO CROOKED HIS KNEES THAT HE LOOKED LIKE A JACK A DANDY PULLED BY STRINGS WHILE ANNA PAVLOVNA PALE AND THRILLED BENDING HER FIGURE LANGUIDLY AND TURNING HER EYES UP
AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE MILITARY BAND WAS PLAYING IN THE STREET BEFORE THE CLUB WHILE IN THE CLUB ITSELF THE OFFICERS WERE DANCING WITH THE LADIES OF K THE LADIES FELT AS THOUGH THEY WERE ON WINGS
I FORGIVE YOU ALL AND HOPE YOU MAY DO WELL YET IF I MAY GIVE YOU ONE BIT OF ADVICE AT PARTING IT IS TO CAUTION YOU AGAINST BEING CLEVER WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO GET BY IT I AIN'T CLEVER AT ALL SAID LIZZIE BEGINNING TO WHIMPER
WHICH NAME STEELE OR BRAINARD YOU ACKNOWLEDGED BOTH MY REAL NAME IS BRAINARD THEREFORE IT IS ALSO HERS BUT I SHALL BE CONTENT IF SHE WILL TAKE MY PRESENT ONE OF STEELE
BUT WHAT ABOVE EVERYTHING REVOLTED HIM AND MOVED HIM TO INDIGNATION WAS THE EXPRESSION OF HAPPINESS ON HIS WIFE'S FACE IT MAKES ME SICK TO LOOK AT HER HE MUTTERED GOING ON FOR FORTY AND NOTHING TO BOAST OF AT ANY TIME
GOD HAS FINISHED WHAT THESE OLD ARMS HAD ONLY STRENGTH ENOUGH TO BEGIN HE IS DEAD THIS TIME AND IT'S A MERCY THANK GOD MISS OLYMPIA THANK GOD AS I DO NOW ON MY KNEES BUT HERE CATCHING THE MAYOR'S EYE
HOW OLD WERE YOU THEN HE DEMANDED WITH ALARMING INCONGRUITY THE SECRETARY STARTED HE ANSWERED HOWEVER CALMLY ENOUGH I SEVEN YEARS AGO I WAS TWENTY FIVE I AM THIRTY TWO NOW SO I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY
AND LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH HIS HEAD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE LIZZIE'S ANGER AGAINST THE MAN CHIEFLY AROSE FROM A FEELING THAT HE TREATED HER WITH ALL A CORSAIR'S FREEDOM WITHOUT ANY OF A CORSAIR'S TENDERNESS
AS IF AFRAID OF BETRAYING A TREMOR IN HIS RIGIDLY DRAWN UP FIGURE WAS THERE THE IMPEDIMENT OF A FORMER MARRIAGE NO ANSWER FROM THE STERNLY SET LIPS OR WAS IT THAT YOU ONCE SERVED A TERM A VERY SHORT TERM CUT SHORT BY A SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE
AND AT THE SAME TIME SHE WAS FULLY AWARE THAT NO WORD COULD PENETRATE HER TAX COLLECTOR'S HIDE WHAT DID HE CARE FOR WORDS HER BITTEREST ENEMY COULD NOT HAVE CONTRIVED FOR HER A MORE HELPLESS POSITION
THE HUSBAND IN THE COURSE OF THE MANEUVRES THE N CAVALRY REGIMENT HALTED FOR A NIGHT AT THE DISTRICT TOWN OF K SUCH AN EVENT AS THE VISIT OF OFFICERS ALWAYS HAS THE MOST EXCITING AND INSPIRING EFFECT ON THE INHABITANTS OF PROVINCIAL TOWNS
TO MARRY AT TWENTY FIVE A GIRL FROM THE KITCHEN ANY GIRL EVEN IF SHE HAD THE MAKING OF AN OLYMPIA PACKARD
THE MAYOR OUTRAGED IN EVERY SENTIMENT OF HONOR AS WELL AS IN THE MOST CHERISHED FEELINGS OF HIS HEART LOWERED UPON HIS UNMOVED SECRETARY WITH A WRATH WHICH WOULD HAVE BORNE DOWN ANY OTHER MAN BEFORE IT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU
GOOD GOOD RANG THRILLING THROUGH THE ROOM
AS TO THE MONEY WHICH LADY EUSTACE CLAIMED MISSUS CARBUNCLE ASSERTED THAT WHEN THE FINAL ACCOUNTS SHOULD BE MADE UP BETWEEN THEM IT WOULD BE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE BALANCE DUE TO MISSUS CARBUNCLE BUT EVEN WERE THERE ANYTHING DUE TO LADY EUSTACE
A LITTLE BRUNETTE OF THIRTY WITH A LONG NOSE AND A POINTED CHIN TIGHTLY LACED WITH HER FACE CAREFULLY POWDERED SHE DANCED WITHOUT PAUSING FOR BREATH DANCED TILL SHE WAS READY TO DROP EXHAUSTED BUT THOUGH SHE WAS EXHAUSTED IN BODY
THE REGIMENT THEY CRIED JOYFULLY THE REGIMENT IS COMING WHAT COULD THIS UNKNOWN REGIMENT THAT CAME BY CHANCE TO DAY AND WOULD DEPART AT DAWN TO MORROW MEAN TO THEM AFTERWARDS WHEN THE OFFICERS WERE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SQUARE
THE LADIES OF K HEARING THE REGIMENT APPROACHING FORSOOK THEIR PANS OF BOILING JAM AND RAN INTO THE STREET FORGETTING THEIR MORNING DESHABILLE AND GENERAL UNTIDINESS THEY RUSHED BREATHLESS WITH EXCITEMENT TO MEET THE REGIMENT
HER HEAD ACHES SAID THE TAX COLLECTOR FOR HIS WIFE COMING OUT OF THE CLUB THE HUSBAND AND WIFE WALKED ALL THE WAY HOME IN SILENCE THE TAX COLLECTOR WALKED BEHIND HIS WIFE AND WATCHING HER DOWNCAST SORROWFUL HUMILIATED LITTLE FIGURE
WOULD NOT LONG RUN IN OBSCURE CHANNELS IT WAS A SARCASM CALCULATED TO MADDEN THE PROUD MAN WHO ONLY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE HAD DESIGNATED THE OBJECT OF IT BY THE SACRED NAME OF WIFE BUT BEYOND A HASTY GLANCE AT THE WOMAN IT HAD BOWED ALMOST TO THE GROUND
WHICH WOULD DELEGALIZE WHATEVER CONTRACT YOU MAY HAVE ENTERED INTO STILL THE SECRETARY'S EYE DID NOT SWERVE
AH DEAR I HAVE KNOWN HER FOR MANY YEARS LIZZIE AND THAT BOTH COVERS AND DISCOVERS MANY FAULTS ONE LEARNS TO KNOW HOW BAD ONE'S OLD FRIENDS ARE BUT THEN ONE FORGIVES THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE OLD FRIENDS YOU CAN'T FORGIVE ME
MISTER STEELE YOU ARE BOTH A VILLAIN AND A BASTARD AND HAVE NO RIGHT IN LAW TO THIS WOMAN CONTRADICT ME IF YOU DARE I DARE BUT WILL NOT WAS THE VIOLENT REPLY I SHALL NOT GIVE YOU EVEN THAT SATISFACTION
LADY EUSTACE DID NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE DURING THE SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AND ENGAGED HERSELF EXCLUSIVELY WITH PREPARING FOR HER JOURNEY SHE HAD NO FURTHER INTERVIEW WITH MISSUS CARBUNCLE BUT THERE WERE MESSAGES BETWEEN THEM AND EVEN NOTES WERE WRITTEN THEY RESULTED IN NOTHING
NO NOT THE DEVIL BUT YOURSELF YOU EVEN THE YOU OF SEVEN YEARS BACK WOULD NOT HAVE LIVED IN ANY COUNTRY TOWN IF NECESSITY OR LET US SAY SAFETY HAD NOT DEMANDED IT YOU WITH YOUR LOOKS AND YOUR AMBITIONS
THE WOMAN WHO HAS QUEENED IT SO LONG IN C SOCIETY CAN NOT WISH TO UNDERGO THE CHARGE OF BIGAMY YOU WILL BRING SUCH A CHARGE CERTAINLY IF SHE DOES NOT VOLUNTARILY QUIT HER FALSE POSITION
I AM GOING TO PORTRAY ON MONDAY AND NEVER COMING BACK ANY MORE YOU'LL BE UP HERE BEFORE THE SEASON IS OVER WITH FIFTY MORE WONDERFUL SCHEMES IN YOUR LITTLE HEAD SO LORD FAWN IS DONE WITH IS HE
YOU YOU YOURSELF COULDN'T HAVE SUSPECTED ME OF TAKING THE DIAMONDS BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU'D GOT THEM YOU KNOW ALL SAFE IN YOUR POCKET BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL OWN THE TRUTH NOW DIDN'T YOU THINK THAT IT WAS I WHO STOLE THE BOX
OF COURSE I WOULD NOT GIVE THEM UP BECAUSE THEY WERE MY OWN
OH LORD GEORGE THAT WAS THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE HOW LITTLE HAPPINESS THERE IS FOR PEOPLE AND WHEN TEWETT GOT THAT GIRL TO SAY SHE'D MARRY HIM
NO WOMAN EVER INTENDED TO SHOW A MORE DISINTERESTED FRIENDSHIP THAN I HAVE DONE AND WHAT HAS BEEN MY RETURN YOU MEAN TO ME DISINTERESTED FRIENDSHIP TO ME AND LORD GEORGE TAPPED HIS BREAST LIGHTLY WITH HIS FINGERS
I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING MYSELF INTELLIGIBLE THE MAYOR FLUSHED INDIGNATION GAVE HIM VEHEMENCE THEN HE CRIED
THERE HAD BEEN A TIME WHEN HE USED TO READ PROGRESSIVE LITERATURE AND SING STUDENTS SONGS BUT NOW AS HE SAID OF HIMSELF HE WAS A TAX COLLECTOR AND NOTHING MORE HE STOOD LEANING AGAINST THE DOORPOST HIS EYES FIXED ON HIS WIFE ANNA PAVLOVNA
OVER WHICH OF THEM SHOULD I WASTE MY TIME THEN THE TIGER BROKE LOOSE IN THE MAN WHO FROM THE AGGRESSOR HAD BECOME THE ATTACKED AND HE CRIED I SHALL NEVER ANSWER THE DEVIL HAS WHISPERED HIS OWN SUGGESTIONS IN YOUR EAR THE DEVIL AND NOTHING ELSE
INTOXICATED BY THE DANCING THE MUSIC AND THE CLANK OF SPURS THEY THREW THEMSELVES HEART AND SOUL INTO MAKING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THEIR NEW PARTNERS AND QUITE FORGOT THEIR OLD CIVILIAN FRIENDS
NOT LAUGHING LORD GEORGE YES YOU WERE YOU HAD GOT THE KERNEL YOURSELF AND THOUGHT THAT I HAD TAKEN ALL THE TROUBLE TO CRACK THE NUT AND HAD FOUND MYSELF WITH NOTHING BUT THE SHELL THEN WHEN YOU FOUND YOU COULDN'T EAT THE KERNEL THAT YOU COULDN'T GET RID OF THE SWAG WITHOUT ASSISTANCE
HE ATTENDS YOU DOWN TO SCOTLAND DOES HE DOES MISTER EMILIUS GO TOO I BELIEVE YOU ARE TRYING TO INSULT ME SIR YOU CAN'T EXPECT BUT WHAT A MAN SHOULD BE A LITTLE JEALOUS WHEN HE HAS BEEN SO COMPLETELY CUT OUT HIMSELF
YOU'RE A PRETTY FIGURE UPON MY SOUL
THIS OF COURSE WAS UNPLEASANT BUT MISSUS CARBUNCLE DID NOT HAVE THE HONOURS OF THE BATTLE ALL TO HERSELF LIZZIE ALSO SAID SOME UNPLEASANT THINGS WHICH PERHAPS WERE THE MORE UNPLEASANT BECAUSE THEY WERE TRUE
YIELDED MORE AND MORE TO A SUDDEN WEAKNESS SAPPING HIS LIFE VIGOR TILL HE FELL PRONE AND APPARENTLY LIFELESS ON THE LOUNGE TOWARD WHICH
BUT NEVERTHELESS THERE WOULD BE SOME EXCITEMENT IN A FAREWELL IN WHICH SOME MOCK AFFECTION MIGHT BE DISPLAYED AND SHE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF ABUSING MISSUS CARBUNCLE SO YOU ARE OFF TO MORROW SAID LORD GEORGE TAKING HIS PLACE ON THE RUG BEFORE HER FIRE
YOUR EDUCATION AS A POLITICIAN HAS YET TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE YOU WILL BE FIT FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP OF A STATE I AM AN ADEPT AT THE GLORIFICATION OF THE PARTY OF THE MAN THAT IT SUITS MY PRESENT EXIGENCIES TO PROMOTE
AND ANNA PAVLOVNA COULD SCARCELY WALK SHE WAS STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DANCING THE MUSIC THE TALK THE LIGHTS AND THE NOISE SHE ASKED HERSELF AS SHE WALKED ALONG WHY GOD HAD THUS AFFLICTED HER
I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE A VERY DANGEROUS COMPANION PRAY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE HORRID NECKLACE THEN CAME THE ROBBERY AND YOU SEEMED TO LOSE YOUR DIAMONDS WITHOUT BEING AT ALL UNHAPPY ABOUT THEM OF COURSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT NOW
AND SO IS THE PRETTINESS LORD GEORGE IF THERE IS ANY I NEVER DOUBTED THAT LADY EUSTACE
PALE BITING HER LIPS AND ALMOST CRYING SHE WENT OUT TO THE ENTRY AND BEGAN PUTTING ON HER THINGS YOU ARE NOT GOING
NOT ONLY HER FACE BUT HER WHOLE FIGURE WAS EXPRESSIVE OF BEATITUDE THE TAX COLLECTOR COULD ENDURE IT NO LONGER HE FELT A DESIRE TO JEER AT THAT BEATITUDE TO MAKE ANNA PAVLOVNA FEEL THAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HERSELF
IS IS OH LORD GEORGE DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT SHE IS I KNOW THAT MISSUS CARBUNCLE IS IN A VERY BAD WAY AND THAT THAT GIRL HAS GONE CRAZY AND THAT POOR GRIFF HAS TAKEN HIMSELF OFF TO JAPAN AND THAT I AM SO KNOCKED ABOUT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO

COVERING HER FACE WITH HER HANDS THEY DON'T DO MUCH GOOD DO THEY IT'S BETTER TO TAKE PEOPLE AS YOU FIND EM AND THEN MAKE THE BEST OF EM THEY'RE A QUEER LOT AIN'T THEY THE SORT OF PEOPLE ONE MEETS ABOUT IN THE WORLD
MISTER STEELE I DO NOT MEAN YOU TO DISTURB MY HOUSE OR TO ROB ME OF MY WIFE WHAT WAS YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOU MET OLYMPIA BREWSTER A PAUSE THE SLIGHTEST IN THE WORLD BUT THE KEEN EYE OF THE ASTUTE LAWYER NOTED IT
IS WHAT MISSUS PACKARD SAYS OF YOUR PLAYING WITH HER FEARS DURING THESE TWO WEEKS TRUE MISTER STEELE WITHOUT A DROOP OF HIS EYE OR A TREMOR IN HIS VOICE THE ANSWER CAME SHORT SHARP AND EMPHATIC YES
NOTHING DELIGHTED YOU MORE THAN TO HAVE ME TIE MY PIECE BAGS ON YOUR BACKS FOR BURDENS GIVE YOU HATS AND STICKS AND ROLLS OF PAPER AND LET YOU TRAVEL THROUGH THE HOUSE FROM THE CELLAR WHICH WAS THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION UP UP TO THE HOUSETOP WHERE
SHE'D NEVER HAVE GONE IN HER RIGHT MIND CRIED HANNAH STARING AFTER HER WHILE THE GIRLS WERE RENDERED QUITE SPEECHLESS BY THE MIRACLE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN STILL MORE AMAZED IF THEY HAD SEEN WHAT BETH DID AFTERWARD
WHOM SHE TRUSTED AND LOVED AMY THOUGH THE YOUNGEST WAS A MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN HER OWN OPINION AT LEAST A REGULAR SNOW MAIDEN WITH BLUE EYES AND YELLOW HAIR CURLING ON HER SHOULDERS PALE AND SLENDER AND ALWAYS CARRYING HERSELF LIKE A YOUNG LADY MINDFUL OF HER MANNERS
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO AND THANK HIM SAID JO BY WAY OF A JOKE FOR THE IDEA OF THE CHILD'S REALLY GOING NEVER ENTERED HER HEAD
ROUND SHOULDERS HAD JO BIG HANDS AND FEET A FLYAWAY LOOK TO HER CLOTHES AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE APPEARANCE OF A GIRL WHO WAS RAPIDLY SHOOTING UP INTO A WOMAN AND DIDN'T LIKE IT ELIZABETH OR BETH AS EVERYONE CALLED HER
SHE WAS NOT ELEGANTLY DRESSED BUT A NOBLE LOOKING WOMAN AND THE GIRLS THOUGHT THE GRAY CLOAK AND UNFASHIONABLE BONNET COVERED THE MOST SPLENDID MOTHER IN THE WORLD WELL DEARIES HOW HAVE YOU GOT ON TODAY
AND THE MOMENT THEY SAW HER SEVERAL HANDS WERE WAVED AND SEVERAL JOYFUL VOICES SCREAMED HERE'S A LETTER FROM THE OLD GENTLEMAN COME QUICK AND READ IT OH BETH HE'S SENT YOU BEGAN AMY GESTICULATING WITH UNSEEMLY ENERGY
I DON'T CARE IF HUGO DOES COME AT ME WITH A PISTOL RETURNED AMY WHO WAS NOT GIFTED WITH DRAMATIC POWER BUT WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE SHE WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO BE BORNE OUT SHRIEKING BY THE VILLAIN OF THE PIECE DO IT THIS WAY CLASP YOUR HANDS SO AND STAGGER ACROSS THE ROOM CRYING FRANTICALLY
BUT I DON'T THINK THE LITTLE WE SHOULD SPEND WOULD DO ANY GOOD WE'VE EACH GOT A DOLLAR AND THE ARMY WOULDN'T BE MUCH HELPED BY OUR GIVING THAT
AND SHE RAN AWAY DECLARING SHE WOULD NEVER GO THERE ANY MORE NOT EVEN FOR THE DEAR PIANO NO PERSUASIONS OR ENTICEMENTS COULD OVERCOME HER FEAR TILL THE FACT COMING TO MISTER LAURENCE'S EAR IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY HE SET ABOUT MENDING MATTERS
THE GIRLS WILL HELP YOU ABOUT THEM AND I WILL PAY FOR THE MAKING UP REPLIED MISSUS MARCH WHO TOOK PECULIAR PLEASURE IN GRANTING BETH'S REQUESTS BECAUSE SHE SO SELDOM ASKED ANYTHING FOR HERSELF
HAS ANYONE CALLED BETH HOW IS YOUR COLD MEG JO YOU LOOK TIRED TO DEATH COME AND KISS ME BABY WHILE MAKING THESE MATERNAL INQUIRIES MISSUS MARCH GOT HER WET THINGS OFF HER WARM SLIPPERS ON AND SITTING DOWN IN THE EASY CHAIR
IS THAT A DAGGER THAT I SEE BEFORE ME MUTTERED JO ROLLING HER EYES AND CLUTCHING AT THE AIR AS SHE HAD SEEN A FAMOUS TRAGEDIAN DO NO IT'S THE TOASTING FORK WITH MOTHER'S SHOE ON IT INSTEAD OF THE BREAD
SO SHE ENJOYED HERSELF HEARTILY AND FOUND WHAT ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE THAT HER GRANTED WISH WAS ALL SHE HAD HOPED PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS BLESSING THAT A GREATER WAS GIVEN HER AT ANY RATE SHE DESERVED BOTH
DREW AMY TO HER LAP PREPARING TO ENJOY THE HAPPIEST HOUR OF HER BUSY DAY THE GIRLS FLEW ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE THINGS COMFORTABLE EACH IN HER OWN WAY MEG ARRANGED THE TEA TABLE JO BROUGHT WOOD AND SET CHAIRS DROPPING OVER TURNING AND CLATTERING EVERYTHING SHE TOUCHED
I KNOW I DO TEACHING THOSE TIRESOME CHILDREN NEARLY ALL DAY WHEN I'M LONGING TO ENJOY MYSELF AT HOME BEGAN MEG IN THE COMPLAINING TONE AGAIN YOU DON'T HAVE HALF SUCH A HARD TIME AS I DO SAID JO
I CAN'T GET OVER MY DISAPPOINTMENT IN NOT BEING A BOY AND IT'S WORSE THAN EVER NOW FOR I'M DYING TO GO AND FIGHT WITH PAPA AND I CAN ONLY STAY HOME AND KNIT LIKE A POKY OLD WOMAN AND JO SHOOK THE BLUE ARMY SOCK TILL THE NEEDLES RATTLED LIKE CASTANETS AND HER BALL BOUNDED ACROSS THE ROOM POOR JO
THAT'S WHY I DO IT I DETEST RUDE UNLADYLIKE GIRLS I HATE AFFECTED NIMINY PIMINY CHITS
DON'T I WISH I COULD GO AS A DRUMMER A VIVAN WHAT'S ITS NAME OR A NURSE SO I COULD BE NEAR HIM AND HELP HIM EXCLAIMED JO WITH A GROAN IT MUST BE VERY DISAGREEABLE TO SLEEP IN A TENT AND EAT ALL SORTS OF BAD TASTING THINGS AND DRINK OUT OF A TIN MUG
HEART'S EASE IS MY FAVORITE FLOWER AND THESE WILL ALWAYS REMIND ME OF THE GENTLE GIVER
HOW BLITHELY SHE SANG THAT EVENING AND HOW THEY ALL LAUGHED AT HER BECAUSE SHE WOKE AMY IN THE NIGHT BY PLAYING THE PIANO ON HER FACE IN HER SLEEP
MEG COULD WALK IN THE CONSERVATORY WHENEVER SHE LIKED AND REVEL IN BOUQUETS JO BROWSED OVER THE NEW LIBRARY VORACIOUSLY AND CONVULSED THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH HER CRITICISMS
IT WAS UNINTERESTING SEWING BUT TONIGHT NO ONE GRUMBLED THEY ADOPTED JO'S PLAN OF DIVIDING THE LONG SEAMS INTO FOUR PARTS AND CALLING THE QUARTERS EUROPE ASIA AFRICA AND AMERICA AND
AS YOUNG READERS LIKE TO KNOW HOW PEOPLE LOOK WE WILL TAKE THIS MOMENT TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE SKETCH OF THE FOUR SISTERS WHO SAT KNITTING AWAY IN THE TWILIGHT WHILE THE DECEMBER SNOW FELL QUIETLY WITHOUT AND THE FIRE CRACKLED CHEERFULLY WITHIN
HOW WILL WE GIVE THE THINGS ASKED MEG
AND AWAY HE WENT IN A GREAT HURRY BETH HAD A RAPTURE WITH HER MOTHER AND THEN RUSHED UP TO IMPART THE GLORIOUS NEWS TO HER FAMILY OF INVALIDS AS THE GIRLS WERE NOT HOME
YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE OFF BOYISH TRICKS AND TO BEHAVE BETTER JOSEPHINE IT DIDN'T MATTER SO MUCH WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL BUT NOW YOU ARE SO TALL AND TURN UP YOUR HAIR
DEAR ME HOW HAPPY AND GOOD WE'D BE IF WE HAD NO WORRIES SAID MEG WHO COULD REMEMBER BETTER TIMES
IT'S PROPER TO USE GOOD WORDS AND IMPROVE YOUR VOCABILARY RETURNED AMY WITH DIGNITY DON'T PECK AT ONE ANOTHER CHILDREN
IT MAKES ME CROSS AND MY HANDS GET SO STIFF I CAN'T PRACTICE WELL AT ALL AND BETH LOOKED AT HER ROUGH HANDS WITH A SIGH THAT ANY ONE COULD HEAR THAT TIME I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF YOU SUFFER AS I DO CRIED AMY
CHAPTER SIX BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL THE BIG HOUSE DID PROVE A PALACE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR ALL TO GET IN AND BETH FOUND IT VERY HARD TO PASS THE LIONS OLD MISTER LAURENCE WAS THE BIGGEST ONE
YOU KNOW THE REASON MOTHER PROPOSED NOT HAVING ANY PRESENTS THIS CHRISTMAS WAS BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE A HARD WINTER FOR EVERYONE AND SHE THINKS WE OUGHT NOT TO SPEND MONEY FOR PLEASURE WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERING SO IN THE ARMY
YES A NICE LONG LETTER HE IS WELL AND THINKS HE SHALL GET THROUGH THE COLD SEASON BETTER THAN WE FEARED HE SENDS ALL SORTS OF LOVING WISHES FOR CHRISTMAS AND AN ESPECIAL MESSAGE TO YOU GIRLS SAID MISSUS MARCH PATTING HER POCKET AS IF SHE HAD GOT A TREASURE THERE
BRIGHTENED TO WELCOME HER MEG STOPPED LECTURING AND LIGHTED THE LAMP AMY GOT OUT OF THE EASY CHAIR WITHOUT BEING ASKED AND JO FORGOT HOW TIRED SHE WAS AS SHE SAT UP TO HOLD THE SLIPPERS NEARER TO THE BLAZE THEY ARE QUITE WORN OUT MARMEE MUST HAVE A NEW PAIR
MISSUS MARCH BROKE THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED JO'S WORDS BY SAYING IN HER CHEERY VOICE DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU USED TO PLAY PILGRIMS PROGRESS WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE THINGS
BUT THE OLD GENTLEMAN NOT BEING AWARE OF HER INFIRMITY STARED AT HER SO HARD FROM UNDER HIS HEAVY EYEBROWS AND SAID HEY
AND GRATITUDE CAN CONQUER PRIDE
BETH TROTTED TO AND FRO BETWEEN PARLOR KITCHEN QUIET AND BUSY WHILE AMY GAVE DIRECTIONS TO EVERYONE AS SHE SAT WITH HER HANDS FOLDED AS THEY GATHERED ABOUT THE TABLE MISSUS MARCH SAID WITH A PARTICULARLY HAPPY FACE I'VE GOT A TREAT FOR YOU AFTER SUPPER
HE SAID TO MISSUS MARCH THE BOY NEGLECTS HIS MUSIC NOW AND I'M GLAD OF IT FOR HE WAS GETTING TOO FOND OF IT BUT THE PIANO SUFFERS FOR WANT OF USE
I THOUGHT I'D GET HER SOME WITH MY DOLLAR SAID BETH NO I SHALL CRIED AMY I'M THE OLDEST BEGAN MEG BUT JO CUT IN WITH A DECIDED
SO THAT THESE HARD DAYS NEED NOT BE WASTED I KNOW THEY WILL REMEMBER ALL I SAID TO THEM THAT THEY WILL BE LOVING CHILDREN TO YOU WILL DO THEIR DUTY FAITHFULLY FIGHT THEIR BOSOM ENEMIES BRAVELY AND CONQUER THEMSELVES SO BEAUTIFULLY
IF JO IS A TOMBOY AND AMY A GOOSE WHAT AM I PLEASE ASKED BETH READY TO SHARE THE LECTURE YOU'RE A DEAR AND NOTHING ELSE ANSWERED MEG WARMLY AND NO ONE CONTRADICTED HER FOR THE MOUSE WAS THE PET OF THE FAMILY
LOOK THERE LOOK THERE BETH DID LOOK AND TURNED PALE WITH DELIGHT AND SURPRISE FOR THERE STOOD A LITTLE CABINET PIANO WITH A LETTER LYING ON THE GLOSSY LID DIRECTED LIKE A SIGN BOARD TO MISS ELIZABETH MARCH
IT WAS A COMFORTABLE ROOM THOUGH THE CARPET WAS FADED AND THE FURNITURE VERY PLAIN FOR A GOOD PICTURE OR TWO HUNG ON THE WALLS BOOKS FILLED THE RECESSES CHRYSANTHEMUMS AND CHRISTMAS ROSES BLOOMED IN THE WINDOWS AND A PLEASANT ATMOSPHERE OF HOME PEACE PERVADED IT
AND IF THEY DON'T CARE TO COME WHY NEVER MIND HERE A LITTLE HAND SLIPPED INTO HIS AND BETH LOOKED UP
ISN'T IT SPLENDID OF HIM DON'T YOU THINK HE'S THE DEAREST OLD MAN IN THE WORLD HERE'S THE KEY IN THE LETTER WE DIDN'T OPEN IT BUT WE ARE DYING TO KNOW WHAT HE SAYS
AND THE SERVANTS ARE NEVER NEAR THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER NINE O'CLOCK HERE HE ROSE AS IF GOING AND BETH MADE UP HER MIND TO SPEAK FOR THAT LAST ARRANGEMENT LEFT NOTHING TO BE DESIRED
BUT AFTER HE HAD CALLED SAID SOMETHING FUNNY OR KIND TO EACH ONE OF THE GIRLS AND TALKED OVER OLD TIMES WITH THEIR MOTHER NOBODY FELT MUCH AFRAID OF HIM EXCEPT TIMID BETH THE OTHER LION WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE POOR AND LAURIE RICH FOR THIS MADE THEM SHY OF ACCEPTING FAVORS WHICH THEY COULD NOT RETURN
GLAD TO FIND YOU SO MERRY MY GIRLS SAID A CHEERY VOICE AT THE DOOR AND ACTORS AND AUDIENCE TURNED TO WELCOME A TALL MOTHERLY LADY WITH A CAN I HELP YOU LOOK ABOUT HER WHICH WAS TRULY DELIGHTFUL
BUT I'D LIKE TO TRY MACBETH IF WE ONLY HAD A TRAPDOOR FOR BANQUO
I'VE WANTED IT SO LONG SAID JO WHO WAS A BOOKWORM I PLANNED TO SPEND MINE IN NEW MUSIC SAID BETH WITH A LITTLE SIGH WHICH NO ONE HEARD BUT THE HEARTH BRUSH AND KETTLE HOLDER I SHALL GET A NICE BOX OF FABER'S DRAWING PENCILS
SAID BETH WHO WAS TOASTING HER FACE AND THE BREAD FOR TEA AT THE SAME TIME LET MARMEE THINK WE ARE GETTING THINGS FOR OURSELVES AND THEN SURPRISE HER WE MUST GO SHOPPING TOMORROW AFTERNOON MEG THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO ABOUT THE PLAY FOR CHRISTMAS NIGHT
WE CAN'T DO MUCH BUT WE CAN MAKE OUR LITTLE SACRIFICES AND OUGHT TO DO IT GLADLY BUT I AM AFRAID I DON'T AND MEG SHOOK HER HEAD AS SHE THOUGHT REGRETFULLY OF ALL THE PRETTY THINGS SHE WANTED
NEXT DAY HAVING SEEN BOTH THE OLD AND YOUNG GENTLEMAN OUT OF THE HOUSE BETH AFTER TWO OR THREE RETREATS FAIRLY GOT IN AT THE SIDE DOOR AND MADE HER WAY AS NOISELESSLY AS ANY MOUSE TO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE HER IDOL STOOD
NOW COME AND HEAR THE LETTER THEY ALL DREW TO THE FIRE
BUT SHE GOT NO FURTHER FOR JO QUENCHED HER BY SLAMMING DOWN THE WINDOW
OUR BURDENS ARE HERE OUR ROAD IS BEFORE US AND THE LONGING FOR GOODNESS AND HAPPINESS IS THE GUIDE THAT LEADS US THROUGH MANY TROUBLES AND MISTAKES TO THE PEACE WHICH IS A TRUE CELESTIAL CITY NOW MY LITTLE PILGRIMS SUPPOSE YOU BEGIN AGAIN
WHAT THE CHARACTERS OF THE FOUR SISTERS WERE WE WILL LEAVE TO BE FOUND OUT THE CLOCK STRUCK SIX AND HAVING SWEPT UP THE HEARTH BETH PUT A PAIR OF SLIPPERS DOWN TO WARM SOMEHOW THE SIGHT OF THE OLD SHOES HAD A GOOD EFFECT UPON THE GIRLS FOR MOTHER WAS COMING AND EVERYONE
THERE BETH THAT'S AN HONOR TO BE PROUD OF I'M SURE LAURIE TOLD ME HOW FOND MISTER LAURENCE USED TO BE OF THE CHILD WHO DIED AND HOW HE KEPT ALL HER LITTLE THINGS CAREFULLY
ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE SECOND DAY SHE WENT OUT TO DO AN ERRAND AND GIVE POOR JOANNA THE INVALID DOLL HER DAILY EXERCISE AS SHE CAME UP THE STREET ON HER RETURN SHE SAW THREE YES FOUR HEADS POPPING IN AND OUT OF THE PARLOR WINDOWS
AFTER MANY SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS WITH MEG AND JO THE PATTERN WAS CHOSEN THE MATERIALS BOUGHT AND THE SLIPPERS BEGUN
I SUSPECT SHE IS RIGHT AND THAT I'VE BEEN CODDLING THE FELLOW AS IF I'D BEEN HIS GRANDMOTHER LET HIM DO WHAT HE LIKES AS LONG AS HE IS HAPPY
AND STRAIGHTWAY FORGOT HER FEAR HERSELF AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THE UNSPEAKABLE DELIGHT WHICH THE MUSIC GAVE HER FOR IT WAS LIKE THE VOICE OF A BELOVED FRIEND
SHE STAYED TILL HANNAH CAME TO TAKE HER HOME TO DINNER BUT SHE HAD NO APPETITE AND COULD ONLY SIT AND SMILE UPON EVERYONE IN A GENERAL STATE OF BEATITUDE
A QUICK BRIGHT SMILE WENT ROUND LIKE A STREAK OF SUNSHINE BETH CLAPPED HER HANDS REGARDLESS OF THE BISCUIT SHE HELD AND JO TOSSED UP HER NAPKIN CRYING A LETTER A LETTER THREE CHEERS FOR FATHER
SAID AMY MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE NOTE TRY IT HONEY LET'S HEAR THE SOUND OF THE BABY PIANNY SAID HANNAH WHO ALWAYS TOOK A SHARE IN THE FAMILY JOYS AND SORROWS SO BETH TRIED IT AND EVERYONE PRONOUNCED IT THE MOST REMARKABLE PIANO EVER HEARD
A LITTLE WOMAN AND NOT BE ROUGH AND WILD BUT DO MY DUTY HERE INSTEAD OF WANTING TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE SAID JO THINKING THAT KEEPING HER TEMPER AT HOME WAS A MUCH HARDER TASK THAN FACING A REBEL OR TWO DOWN SOUTH BETH SAID NOTHING BUT WIPED AWAY HER TEARS
THEN THINGS WENT SMOOTHLY FOR DON PEDRO DEFIED THE WORLD IN A SPEECH OF TWO PAGES WITHOUT A SINGLE BREAK HAGAR THE WITCH CHANTED AN AWFUL INCANTATION OVER HER KETTLEFUL OF SIMMERING TOADS WITH WEIRD EFFECT
VERY FEW LETTERS WERE WRITTEN IN THOSE HARD TIMES THAT WERE NOT TOUCHING ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH FATHERS SENT HOME
LET'S EACH GET HER SOMETHING FOR CHRISTMAS AND NOT GET ANYTHING FOR OURSELVES THAT'S LIKE YOU DEAR WHAT WILL WE GET EXCLAIMED JO EVERYONE THOUGHT SOBERLY FOR A MINUTE THEN MEG ANNOUNCED AS IF THE IDEA WAS SUGGESTED BY THE SIGHT OF HER OWN PRETTY HANDS
DEAR MADAM HOW NICE IT SOUNDS I WISH SOMEONE WOULD WRITE TO ME SO SAID AMY WHO THOUGHT THE OLD FASHIONED ADDRESS VERY ELEGANT I HAVE HAD MANY PAIRS OF SLIPPERS IN MY LIFE BUT I NEVER HAD ANY THAT SUITED ME SO WELL AS YOURS CONTINUES JO
IT'S BAD ENOUGH TO BE A GIRL ANYWAY WHEN I LIKE BOY'S GAMES AND WORK AND MANNERS
BETH ATE NO MORE BUT CREPT AWAY TO SIT IN HER SHADOWY CORNER AND BROOD OVER THE DELIGHT TO COME TILL THE OTHERS WERE READY I THINK IT WAS SO SPLENDID IN FATHER TO GO AS CHAPLAIN WHEN HE WAS TOO OLD TO BE DRAFTED AND NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR A SOLDIER SAID MEG WARMLY
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD JO WAS VERY TALL THIN AND BROWN AND REMINDED ONE OF A COLT FOR SHE NEVER SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HER LONG LIMBS WHICH WERE VERY MUCH IN HER WAY
IT'S THE BEST WE'VE HAD YET SAID MEG AS THE DEAD VILLAIN SAT UP AND RUBBED HIS ELBOWS I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN WRITE AND ACT SUCH SPLENDID THINGS JO
AND THE PRETTY RACK AND STOOL ALL COMPLETE ADDED MEG OPENING THE INSTRUMENT AND DISPLAYING ITS BEAUTIES
SAID JO MARCHING UP AND DOWN WITH HER HANDS BEHIND HER BACK AND HER NOSE IN THE AIR I DON'T MEAN TO ACT ANY MORE AFTER THIS TIME I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR SUCH THINGS OBSERVED MEG WHO WAS AS MUCH A CHILD AS EVER ABOUT DRESSING UP FROLICS
IN HER EARNEST YET TIMID WAY OH SIR THEY DO CARE VERY VERY MUCH ARE YOU THE MUSICAL GIRL HE ASKED WITHOUT ANY STARTLING HEY AS HE LOOKED DOWN AT HER VERY KINDLY I'M BETH
AGAINST HER ROSY ONE FEELING AS IF HE HAD GOT HIS OWN LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER BACK AGAIN BETH CEASED TO FEAR HIM FROM THAT MOMENT AND SAT THERE TALKING TO HIM AS COZILY AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN HIM ALL HER LIFE FOR LOVE CASTS OUT FEAR
IT WAS A CHEERFUL HOPEFUL LETTER FULL OF LIVELY DESCRIPTIONS OF CAMP LIFE MARCHES AND MILITARY NEWS AND ONLY AT THE END DID THE WRITER'S HEART OVER FLOW WITH FATHERLY LOVE AND LONGING FOR THE LITTLE GIRLS AT HOME
SIGHED AMY WHEN WILL HE COME HOME MARMEE ASKED BETH WITH A LITTLE QUIVER IN HER VOICE NOT FOR MANY MONTHS DEAR UNLESS HE IS SICK
SHE NEVER SAW LAURIE MOUNT GUARD IN THE HALL TO WARN THE SERVANTS AWAY
DURING ONE OF THE BRIEF CALLS HE MADE HE ARTFULLY LED THE CONVERSATION TO MUSIC AND TALKED AWAY ABOUT GREAT SINGERS WHOM HE HAD SEEN FINE ORGANS HE HAD HEARD
NEVER HAVING KNOWN MOTHER OR SISTERS HE WAS QUICK TO FEEL THE INFLUENCES THEY BROUGHT ABOUT HIM AND THEIR BUSY LIVELY WAYS MADE HIM ASHAMED OF THE INDOLENT LIFE HE LED
BEFORE MISSUS MARCH COULD REPLY MISTER LAURENCE WENT ON WITH AN ODD LITTLE NOD AND SMILE THEY NEEDN'T SEE OR SPEAK TO ANYONE BUT RUN IN AT ANY TIME FOR I'M SHUT UP IN MY STUDY AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE LAURIE IS OUT A GREAT DEAL
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE SHUT UP FOR HOURS WITH A NERVOUS FUSSY OLD LADY WHO KEEPS YOU TROTTING IS NEVER SATISFIED AND WORRIES YOU TILL YOU'RE READY TO FLY OUT THE WINDOW OR CRY IT'S NAUGHTY TO FRET BUT I DO THINK WASHING DISHES AND KEEPING THINGS TIDY IS THE WORST WORK IN THE WORLD
FOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL WITH IMPERTINENT GIRLS WHO PLAGUE YOU IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR LESSONS AND LAUGH AT YOUR DRESSES AND LABEL YOUR FATHER IF HE ISN'T RICH AND INSULT YOU WHEN YOUR NOSE ISN'T NICE
WELL I THINK WE ARE FOR THOUGH WE DO HAVE TO WORK WE MAKE FUN OF OURSELVES AND ARE A PRETTY JOLLY SET AS JO WOULD SAY JO DOES USE SUCH SLANG WORDS OBSERVED AMY WITH A REPROVING LOOK AT THE LONG FIGURE STRETCHED ON THE RUG
AND I SHALL PROVIDE THE SLIPPERS FOR HE TOLD ME TO TAKE SPECIAL CARE OF MOTHER WHILE HE WAS GONE
AMY FOLLOWED BUT SHE POKED HER HANDS OUT STIFFLY BEFORE HER AND JERKED HERSELF ALONG AS IF SHE WENT BY MACHINERY AND HER OW WAS MORE SUGGESTIVE OF PINS BEING RUN INTO HER THAN OF FEAR AND ANGUISH
JO GAVE A DESPAIRING GROAN AND MEG LAUGHED OUTRIGHT WHILE BETH LET HER BREAD BURN AS SHE WATCHED THE FUN WITH INTEREST IT'S NO USE DO THE BEST YOU CAN WHEN THE TIME COMES AND IF THE AUDIENCE LAUGHS DON'T BLAME ME COME ON MEG
THE OLD GENTLEMAN SOFTLY STROKED THE HAIR OFF HER FOREHEAD AND STOOPING DOWN HE KISSED HER SAYING IN A TONE FEW PEOPLE EVER HEARD I HAD A LITTLE GIRL ONCE WITH EYES LIKE THESE GOD BLESS YOU MY DEAR GOOD DAY MADAM
HURRY AND GET DONE DON'T STOP TO QUIRK YOUR LITTLE FINGER AND SIMPER OVER YOUR PLATE AMY CRIED JO CHOKING ON HER TEA AND DROPPING HER BREAD BUTTER SIDE DOWN ON THE CARPET IN HER HASTE TO GET AT THE TREAT
HE WAS TIRED OF BOOKS AND FOUND PEOPLE SO INTERESTING NOW THAT MISTER BROOKE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE VERY UNSATISFACTORY REPORTS FOR LAURIE WAS ALWAYS PLAYING TRUANT AND RUNNING OVER TO THE MARCHES NEVER MIND LET HIM TAKE A HOLIDAY AND MAKE IT UP AFTERWARD
HE CAN'T GET INTO MISCHIEF IN THAT LITTLE NUNNERY OVER THERE AND MISSUS MARCH IS DOING MORE FOR HIM THAN WE CAN WHAT GOOD TIMES THEY HAD TO BE SURE
A CLUSTER OF GRAVE YET CHEERFUL PANSIES ON A DEEPER PURPLE GROUND WAS PRONOUNCED VERY APPROPRIATE AND PRETTY AND BETH WORKED AWAY EARLY AND LATE WITH OCCASIONAL LIFTS OVER HARD PARTS SHE WAS A NIMBLE LITTLE NEEDLEWOMAN AND THEY WERE FINISHED BEFORE ANYONE GOT TIRED OF THEM
YOU READ IT I CAN'T I FEEL SO QUEER OH IT IS TOO LOVELY AND BETH HID HER FACE IN JO'S APRON QUITE UPSET BY HER PRESENT JO OPENED THE PAPER AND BEGAN TO LAUGH FOR THE FIRST WORDS SHE SAW WERE MISS MARCH
I'M NOT AND IF TURNING UP MY HAIR MAKES ME ONE I'LL WEAR IT IN TWO TAILS TILL I'M TWENTY CRIED JO PULLING OFF HER NET AND SHAKING DOWN A CHESTNUT MANE
YES I MEAN TO I GUESS I'LL GO NOW BEFORE I GET FRIGHTENED THINKING ABOUT IT AND TO THE UTTER AMAZEMENT OF THE ASSEMBLED FAMILY BETH WALKED DELIBERATELY DOWN THE GARDEN THROUGH THE HEDGE AND IN AT THE LAURENCES DOOR WELL
I LIKE TO PAY MY DEBTS SO I KNOW YOU WILL ALLOW THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO SEND YOU SOMETHING WHICH ONCE BELONGED TO THE LITTLE GRAND DAUGHTER HE LOST WITH HEARTY THANKS AND BEST WISHES I REMAIN YOUR GRATEFUL FRIEND AND HUMBLE SERVANT JAMES LAURENCE
BUT I'LL TRULY TRY TO BE BETTER SO HE MAYN'T BE DISAPPOINTED IN ME BY AND BY WE ALL WILL CRIED MEG I THINK TOO MUCH OF MY LOOKS AND HATE TO WORK BUT WON'T ANY MORE IF I CAN HELP IT
IF I WASN'T TOO OLD FOR SUCH THINGS I'D RATHER LIKE TO PLAY IT OVER AGAIN SAID AMY WHO BEGAN TO TALK OF RENOUNCING CHILDISH THINGS AT THE MATURE AGE OF TWELVE WE NEVER ARE TOO OLD FOR THIS MY DEAR BECAUSE IT IS A PLAY WE ARE PLAYING ALL THE TIME IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
THEIR CHEERFUL SOCIETY AND THE COMFORT HE TOOK IN THAT HUMBLE HOME OF THEIRS SO THEY SOON FORGOT THEIR PRIDE AND INTERCHANGED KINDNESSES WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK WHICH WAS THE GREATER
WOULDN'T SOME OF YOUR GIRLS LIKE TO RUN OVER AND PRACTICE ON IT NOW AND THEN JUST TO KEEP IT IN TUNE YOU KNOW MA'AM BETH TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND PRESSED HER HANDS TIGHTLY TOGETHER TO KEEP FROM CLAPPING THEM FOR THIS WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE TEMPTATION AND THE THOUGHT OF PRACTICING ON THAT SPLENDID INSTRUMENT QUITE TOOK HER BREATH AWAY
WHEN THIS EXCITEMENT WAS OVER BETH WAITED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
AND TOLD SUCH CHARMING ANECDOTES THAT BETH FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY IN HER DISTANT CORNER BUT CREPT NEARER AND NEARER AS IF FASCINATED
THAT WHEN I COME BACK TO THEM I MAY BE FONDER AND PROUDER THAN EVER OF MY LITTLE WOMEN EVERYBODY SNIFFED WHEN THEY CAME TO THAT PART
BUT AFTER A WHILE THEY FOUND
EYES WIDE OPEN AND HER CHEEKS RED WITH EXCITEMENT OF THIS UNUSUAL PERFORMANCE
AMY COPIED PICTURES AND ENJOYED BEAUTY TO HER HEART'S CONTENT AND LAURIE PLAYED LORD OF THE MANOR IN THE MOST DELIGHTFUL STYLE BUT BETH THOUGH YEARNING FOR THE GRAND PIANO COULD NOT PLUCK UP COURAGE TO GO TO THE MANSION OF BLISS AS MEG CALLED IT SHE WENT ONCE WITH JO
I LOVE IT DEARLY AND I'LL COME IF YOU ARE QUITE SURE NOBODY WILL HEAR ME AND BE DISTURBED SHE ADDED FEARING TO BE RUDE AND TREMBLING AT HER OWN BOLDNESS AS SHE SPOKE NOT A SOUL MY DEAR THE HOUSE IS EMPTY HALF THE DAY
LOOK UNDER YOUR PILLOWS CHRISTMAS MORNING AND YOU WILL FIND YOUR GUIDEBOOK REPLIED MISSUS MARCH THEY TALKED OVER THE NEW PLAN WHILE OLD HANNAH CLEARED THE TABLE THEN OUT CAME THE FOUR LITTLE WORK BASKETS AND THE NEEDLES FLEW AS THE GIRLS MADE SHEETS FOR AUNT MARCH
YOU HAD ALL THE LOVELY THINGS YOU COULD COLLECT TO MAKE A CELESTIAL CITY WHAT FUN IT WAS ESPECIALLY GOING BY THE LIONS FIGHTING APOLLYON AND PASSING THROUGH THE VALLEY WHERE THE HOB GOBLINS WERE SAID JO
I REALLY NEED THEM SAID AMY DECIDEDLY MOTHER DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT OUR MONEY AND SHE WON'T WISH US TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING LET'S EACH BUY WHAT WE WANT AND HAVE A LITTLE FUN I'M SURE WE WORK HARD ENOUGH TO EARN IT CRIED JO EXAMINING THE HEELS OF HER SHOES IN A GENTLEMANLY MANNER
SHE HAD A DECIDED MOUTH A COMICAL NOSE AND SHARP GRAY EYES WHICH APPEARED TO SEE EVERYTHING AND WERE BY TURNS FIERCE FUNNY OR THOUGHTFUL HER LONG THICK HAIR WAS HER ONE BEAUTY BUT IT WAS USUALLY BUNDLED INTO A NET TO BE OUT OF HER WAY
YOU WON'T STOP I KNOW AS LONG AS YOU CAN TRAIL ROUND IN A WHITE GOWN WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN AND WEAR GOLD PAPER JEWELRY YOU ARE THE BEST ACTRESS WE'VE GOT AND THERE'LL BE AN END OF EVERYTHING IF YOU QUIT THE BOARDS SAID JO WE OUGHT TO REHEARSE TONIGHT

I RATHER THINK SHE HASN'T GOT ANY SAID HER MOTHER YES I HAVE MINE IS DISHES AND DUSTERS AND ENVYING GIRLS WITH NICE PIANOS AND BEING AFRAID OF PEOPLE BETH'S BUNDLE WAS SUCH A FUNNY ONE THAT EVERYBODY WANTED TO LAUGH BUT NOBODY DID FOR IT WOULD HAVE HURT HER FEELINGS VERY MUCH
OH DEAR YES HE LIKED IT AMAZINGLY AND WAS SO TOUCHED AND PLEASED BY THAT CONFIDING LITTLE KISS THAT ALL HIS CRUSTINESS VANISHED AND HE JUST SET HER ON HIS KNEE AND LAID HIS WRINKLED CHEEK
IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME SHE WENT AND KNOCKED AT THE STUDY DOOR BEFORE SHE GAVE HERSELF TIME TO THINK AND WHEN A GRUFF VOICE CALLED OUT COME IN SHE DID GO IN RIGHT UP TO MISTER LAURENCE WHO LOOKED QUITE TAKEN ABACK AND HELD OUT HER HAND SAYING
SAID BETH CONTENTEDLY FROM HER CORNER THE FOUR YOUNG FACES ON WHICH THE FIRELIGHT SHONE BRIGHTENED AT THE CHEERFUL WORDS BUT DARKENED AGAIN AS JO SAID SADLY WE HAVEN'T GOT FATHER AND SHALL NOT HAVE HIM FOR A LONG TIME
CAN I DO IT ASKED BETH A FEW WEEKS AFTER THAT EVENTFUL CALL OF HIS YES DEAR IT WILL PLEASE HIM VERY MUCH
IT'S TOO BAD BUT IT CAN'T BE HELPED SO YOU MUST TRY TO BE CONTENTED WITH MAKING YOUR NAME BOYISH AND PLAYING BROTHER TO US GIRLS

AS FOR YOU AMY CONTINUED MEG YOU ARE ALTOGETHER TOO PARTICULAR AND PRIM YOUR AIRS ARE FUNNY NOW BUT YOU'LL GROW UP AN AFFECTED LITTLE GOOSE IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE I LIKE YOUR NICE MANNERS AND REFINED WAYS OF SPEAKING WHEN YOU DON'T TRY TO BE ELEGANT
SO COME AND DRUM AWAY AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE AND I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO YOU HOW KIND YOU ARE SIR BETH BLUSHED LIKE A ROSE UNDER THE FRIENDLY LOOK HE WORE BUT SHE WAS NOT FRIGHTENED NOW
LET US DO IT SAID MEG THOUGHTFULLY IT IS ONLY ANOTHER NAME FOR TRYING TO BE GOOD AND THE STORY MAY HELP US
WITH THE DELIGHTFUL ENTHUSIASM OF YOUTH THEY TOOK THE SOLITARY BOY INTO THEIR MIDST AND MADE MUCH OF HIM AND HE FOUND SOMETHING VERY CHARMING IN THE INNOCENT COMPANIONSHIP OF THESE SIMPLE HEARTED GIRLS
SHE DIDN'T SAY PERHAPS NEVER BUT EACH SILENTLY ADDED IT THINKING OF FATHER FAR AWAY WHERE THE FIGHTING WAS NOBODY SPOKE FOR A MINUTE THEN MEG SAID IN AN ALTERED TONE
ALL SORTS OF PLEASANT THINGS HAPPENED ABOUT THAT TIME FOR THE NEW FRIENDSHIP FLOURISHED LIKE GRASS IN SPRING EVERY ONE LIKED LAURIE AND HE PRIVATELY INFORMED HIS TUTOR THAT THE MARCHES WERE REGULARLY SPLENDID GIRLS
AT NINE THEY STOPPED WORK AND SANG AS USUAL BEFORE THEY WENT TO BED NO ONE BUT BETH COULD GET MUCH MUSIC OUT OF THE OLD PIANO BUT SHE HAD A WAY OF SOFTLY TOUCHING THE YELLOW KEYS AND MAKING A PLEASANT ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE SIMPLE SONGS THEY SANG
ARMY SHOES BEST TO BE HAD CRIED JO SOME HANDKERCHIEFS ALL HEMMED SAID BETH
BUT OUT OF SCHOOL YE GODS AND LITTLE FISHES HOW TOMMY DID CAROUSE HE WOUND FAT ASIA UP IN HER OWN CLOTHES LINE AGAINST THE POST AND LEFT HERE THERE TO FUME AND SCOLD FOR HALF AN HOUR ONE BUSY MONDAY MORNING
TOMMY WAS SO STAGGERED BY THIS LAST SPEECH THAT HE NEARLY TUMBLED DOWN THE BANK BUT SAVED HIMSELF
AND I COULDN'T GO ON NO SIR
GOT RUN AWAY WITH AND HAD HIS EARS BOXED VIOLENT BY ASIA WHO CAUGHT HIM LUXURIOUSLY SKIMMING A PAN OF CREAM WITH HALF A STOLEN PIE UNDAUNTED HOWEVER BY ANY FAILURES OR REBUFFS THIS INDOMITABLE YOUTH WENT ON AMUSING HIMSELF WITH ALL SORTS OF TRICKS TILL NO ONE FELT SAFE
MISTER BHAER HAD JUST TAKEN DOWN THE LONG RULE THAT HUNG OVER HIS DESK
MISSUS BHAER HAD ADDRESSED HERSELF TO NAN BUT THE BOYS NUDGED ONE ANOTHER AND APPEARED TO TAKE THE HINT FOR THAT TIME AT LEAST AND PASSED THE BUTTER SAID PLEASE AND THANK YOU YES SIR AND NO MA'AM WITH UNUSUAL ELEGANCE AND RESPECT NAN SAID NOTHING
AND HE AROSE FROM EVERY DOWNFALL WITH REDOUBLED VIGOR THE FIRST DAY HE CAME HE CHOPPED THE TOP OFF ONE FINGER IN THE HAY CUTTER
AND SO SHOOK AND HUSTLED POOR STUFFY THAT FOR A MINUTE HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WAS ON HIS HEAD OR HIS HEELS SHE TOLD ME TO WAS ALL HE COULD SAY WHEN TOMMY LET HIM ALONE
DAISY WAS IN DESPAIR BUT NAN TOOK IT TO THE PAINTER WHO AS AT WORK ABOUT THE HOUSE GOT HIM TO PAINT IT BRICK RED WITH STARING BLACK EYES THEN SHE DRESSED IT UP WITH FEATHERS AND SCARLET FLANNEL AND ONE OF NED'S LEADEN HATCHETS AND IN THE CHARACTER OF AN INDIAN CHIEF THE LATE
WHERE HE WORKED AND HUMMED AS BUSILY AS THE BEES BOOMING ALL ABOUT HIM THIS IS THE CROP I LIKE BEST MISSUS BHAER USED TO SAY AS SHE PINCHED THE ONCE THIN CHEEKS NOW GETTING PLUMP AND RUDDY
THEY KNOW HEAPS AND I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING SAID NAT
IT IS SO MUCH NICER THAN FIDDLING IN THE STREET FOR THEN I GOT NONE OF THE MONEY AND NOW I HAVE IT ALL AND A GOOD TIME BESIDES
GIVING AWAY HER THINGS RIGHT AND LEFT AS LAVISHLY AS IF THE BIG BAND BOX HAD NO BOTTOM IT WAS THOSE GOOD TRAITS THAT SOON MADE LITTLE GIDDYGADDY AS THEY CALLED HER A FAVORITE WITH EVERY ONE DAISY NEVER COMPLAINED OF BEING DULL AGAIN
NAT DREW HIS SLEEVE ACROSS HIS EYES AND GAVE TWO MORE QUICK HARD STROKES THAT REDDENED THE HAND YET HURT THE GIVER MORE ISN'T THAT ENOUGH HE ASKED IN A BREATHLESS SORT OF TONE TWO MORE WAS ALL THE ANSWER AND HE GAVE THEM HARDLY SEEING WHERE THEY FELL THEN THREW THE RULE ALL ACROSS THE ROOM
CALLED OUT THE COMMODORE WHO JUST THEN HOVE IN SIGHT I DON'T HURT HER DO I DAISY AND DEMI TURNED TO HIS SISTER WHO WAS POORING NAN'S TINGLING HANDS AND RECOMMENDING WATER FOR THE PURPLE LUMP RAPIDLY DEVELOPING ITSELF ON HER FOREHEAD
FOR THEY ALWAYS FLEW AT THEIR FATHER THE MINUTE SCHOOL WAS DONE AT FIRST PERHAPS BUT IT WILL DO POSY GOOD SHE IS GETTING PRIM AND BETTYISH AND NEEDS STIRRING UP A BIT SHE ALWAYS HAS A GOOD TIME WHEN NAN COMES OVER TO PLAY AND THE TWO WILL HELP EACH OTHER WITHOUT KNOWING IT
TROTTED TO TAP AT HIS DOOR WITH A MOTHERLY GET UP MY DEAR IT'S MOST BREAKFAST TIME AND HERE'S YOUR CLEAN COLLAR
FOR THIS REVERSING THE ORDER OF THINGS ALMOST TOOK THEIR BREATH AWAY HE MADE ME DO THE SAME THING ONCE SAID EMIL AS IF CONFESSING A CRIME OF THE DEEPEST DYE AND YOU HIT HIM DEAR OLD FATHER BHAER BY THUNDER I'D JUST LIKE TO SEE YOU DO IT NOW SAID NED
AND HELP HIM WITH HIS LESSONS FOR THEY KEPT ABREAST THERE AND HAD NO THOUGHT OF RIVALRY THE LOVE BETWEEN THEM WAS AS STRONG AS EVER AND NO ONE COULD LAUGH DEMI OUT OF HIS AFFECTIONATE WAYS WITH DAISY
AND YOUR AUNT CAME AND CARRIED ME OFF ISN'T IT GREAT FUN WHY YES DID YOU BRING YOUR BIG DOLL ASKED DAISY HOPING SHE HAD FOR ON THE LAST VISIT NAN HAD RAVAGED THE BABY HOUSE AND INSISTED ON WASHING BLANCHE MATILDA'S PLASTER FACE
I AM SORRY YOU HATE MY BOYS BECAUSE THEY CAN BE WELL MANNERED AND MOST AGREEABLE WHEN THEY CHOOSE
YOU ARE THE BEST BOY IN THE WORLD PROMPTLY ANSWERED DAISY ADDING AS TRUTH COMPELLED HER TO DO YOU HURT ME SOMETIMES BUT YOU DON'T MEAN TO PUT AWAY THE BATS AND THINGS AND MIND WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT MY HEARTIES NO FIGHTING ALLOWED ABOARD THIS SHIP
DO IT AGAIN SAID STUFFY ANGRILY AND NAN WOULD HAVE DONE IT BUT NAT HELD HER AND TOMMY FORGETTING THE HEAT FLEW AT STUFFY LIKE A LITTLE GAME COCK ROARING OUT STOP IT OR I'LL THROW YOU OVER THE BARN
THE BOYS THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN AND NAN ENTERTAINED THEM ALL SUPPER TIME WITH AN ACCOUNT OF HER ADVENTURES FOR A BIG DOG HAD BARKED AT HER A MAN HAD LAUGHED AT HER A WOMAN HAD GIVEN HER A DOUGHNUT AND HER HAT HAD FALLEN INTO THE BROOK WHEN SHE STOPPED TO DRINK EXHAUSTED WITH HER EXERTION
FOR HE NEVER WAS STILL FORTUNATELY HE WAS NOT MISCHIEVOUS NOR VERY BRAVE
TEDDY WAS TOO YOUNG TO PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT PART IN THE AFFAIRS OF PLUMFIELD YET HE HAD HIS LITTLE SPHERE AND FILLED IT BEAUTIFULLY EVERY ONE FELT THE NEED OF A PET AT TIMES AND BABY WAS ALWAYS READY TO ACCOMMODATE FOR KISSING AND CUDDLING SUITED HIM EXCELLENTLY
AND THEN TROTTED BACK AGAIN SAYING AS HE ALWAYS DID WHEN DISAPPOINTED OF THE LONGED FOR SIGHT
BE IT FOR POETRY OR PLOUGHING IT SHALL BE CULTIVATED AND MADE USEFUL TO THEM IF POSSIBLE SO WHEN NAT CAME RUNNING TO HIM ONE DAY TO ASK WITH AN EXCITED FACE
AND HIS EAGERNESS TO SEE WHAT CAME NEXT IN THE STORY HELPED HIM ON TILL HE COULD READ AS WELL AS ANYBODY
SHE HARNESSED THE OLD TURKEY COCK TO A STRAW WAGON AND MADE HIM TROT ROUND THE HOUSE AT A TREMENDOUS PACE SHE GAVE HER CORAL NECKLACE FOR FOUR UNHAPPY KITTENS WHICH HAD BEEN TORMENTED BY SOME HEARTLESS LADS AND TENDED THEM FOR DAYS AS GENTLY AS A MOTHER DRESSING THEIR WOUNDS WITH COLD CREAM
YOU WILL HAVE DONE A MAGNIFICENT WORK INTERRUPTED MISTER BHAER
I'M GOING TO SAVE UP TILL I GET ENOUGH TO BUY A VIOLIN FOR MYSELF AND THEN I CAN EARN MY OWN LIVING CAN'T I HE USED TO SAY AS HE BROUGHT HIS DOLLARS TO MISTER BHAER TO KEEP I HOPE SO NAT BUT WE MUST GET YOU STRONG AND HEARTY FIRST AND PUT A LITTLE MORE KNOWLEDGE INTO THIS MUSICAL HEAD OF YOURS
AND NAN PRESENTED A HORSE HAIR RING IN TOKEN OF FRIENDSHIP AS THEY HAD BOTH VOWED THEY WOULD NEVER SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER AGAIN WHEN THEY LAST PARTED WON BY THE BEAUTY OF THE OFFERING DAISY GREW MORE CORDIAL AND PROPOSED RETIRING TO THE NURSERY BUT NAN SAID
FROM THE BREAKING OF TOMMY'S OWN NECK TO THE BLOWING UP OF THE ENTIRE FAMILY WITH GUNPOWDER AND NURSEY HAD A PARTICULAR DRAWER IN WHICH SHE KEPT BANDAGES PLASTERS AND SALVES FOR HIS ESPECIAL USE FOR TOMMY WAS ALWAYS BEING BROUGHT IN HALF DEAD BUT NOTHING EVER KILLED HIM
OR FOLLOW SILAS THE MAN FROM PLACE TO PLACE SEEING HIM WORK
FRITZ I'VE GOT A NEW IDEA CRIED MISSUS BHAER AS SHE MET HER HUSBAND ONE DAY AFTER SCHOOL WELL MY DEAR WHAT IS IT AND HE WAITED WILLINGLY TO HEAR THE NEW PLAN
THIS APPEAL ESTABLISHED THE RIGHT FEELING AMONG THEM AND NAT HAD FEW HINDRANCES TO STRUGGLE AGAINST FOR EVERY ONE WAS GLAD TO GIVE HIM A BOOST UP THE LADDER OF LEARNING TILL HE WAS STRONGER MUCH STUDY WAS NOT GOOD FOR HIM HOWEVER
STRIKE YOU OH I COULDN'T CRIED NAT THEN MIND THAT TRIPPING TONGUE OF THINE I HAVE NO WISH TO BE HURT BUT I WOULD GLADLY BEAR MUCH PAIN TO CURE THIS FAULT THIS SUGGESTION MADE SUCH AN IMPRESSION ON NAT THAT FOR A LONG TIME HE SET A WATCH UPON HIS LIPS
ASKED MISTER BHAER PATTING THE HAND THAT LAY ON HIS ARM OH DEAR NO SAID MOTHER BHAER BRISKLY I LIKE IT AND NEVER WAS HAPPIER THAN SINCE I HAD MY WILDERNESS OF BOYS YOU SEE FRITZ I FEEL A GREAT SYMPATHY FOR NAN BECAUSE I WAS SUCH A NAUGHTY CHILD MYSELF THAT I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
WHAT HAS IT BEEN DOING TO GET THOSE BLISTERS HE ASKED DRAWING IT FROM BEHIND HER BACK WHERE SHE HAD PUT IT WITH A LOOK WHICH MADE HIM THINK SHE HAD BEEN IN MISCHIEF BEFORE NAN COULD THINK OF ANY EXCUSE DAISY BURST OUT WITH THE WHOLE STORY DURING WHICH STUFFY TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE IN A BOWL OF BREAD AND MILK
MY PARENTS HAD TALKED AND CRIED AND PUNISHED BUT STILL DID I FORGET AS YOU THEN SAID THE DEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER I SHALL HELP YOU TO REMEMBER AND PUT A CHECK ON THIS UNRULY PART WITH THAT SHE DREW OUT MY TONGUE AND SNIPPED THE END WITH HER SCISSORS TILL THE BLOOD RAN THAT WAS TERRIBLE YOU MAY BELIEVE
LOOKING AS SCARED AND GUILTY AS IF ABOUT TO STAB HIS MASTER HE GAVE TWO FEEBLE BLOWS ON THE BROAD HAND HELD OUT TO HIM THEN HE STOPPED AND LOOKED UP HALF BLIND WITH TEARS BUT MISTER BHAER SAID STEADILY GO ON AND STRIKE HARDER AS IF SEEING THAT IT MUST BE DONE AND EAGER TO HAVE THE HARD TASK SOON OVER
DEMI WAS ONE OF THE CHILDREN WHO SHOW PLAINLY THE EFFECT OF INTELLIGENT LOVE AND CARE FOR SOUL AND BODY WORKED HARMONIOUSLY TOGETHER THE NATURAL REFINEMENT WHICH NOTHING BUT HOME INFLUENCE CAN TEACH GAVE HIM SWEET AND SIMPLE MANNERS HIS MOTHER HAD CHERISHED AN INNOCENT AND LOVING HEART IN HIM
AND THEN THOUGHT HIM TOO DELICATE TO STUDY SO THAT AT TWELVE YEARS OLD HE WAS A PALE PUFFY BOY DULL FRETFUL AND LAZY A FRIEND PERSUADED HER TO SEND HIM TO PLUMFIELD AND THERE HE SOON GOT WAKED UP FOR SWEET THINGS WERE SELDOM ALLOWED MUCH EXERCISE REQUIRED
WHILE DEMI CONSTRUCTED WATER MILLS WHIRLIGIGS AND UNKNOWN MACHINES OF AN INTRICATE AND USELESS NATURE AND DISPOSED OF THEM TO THE BOYS LET HIM BE A MECHANIC IF HE LIKES SAID MISTER BHAER GIVE A BOY A TRADE AND HE IS INDEPENDENT WORK IS WHOLESOME AND WHATEVER TALENT THESE LADS POSSESS
THOUGH YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT FOR SHE PETTED HIM AS SHE DID DAISY AND HE THOUGHT HER A VERY DELIGHTFUL WOMAN ONE FAULT OF NAT'S GAVE THE BHAERS MUCH ANXIETY ALTHOUGH THEY SAW HOW IT HAD BEEN STRENGTHENED BY FEAR AND IGNORANCE I REGRET TO SAY THAT NAT SOMETIMES TOLD LIES
INDEED THE FAMILY CALLED HIM THE BLUNDERBUSS AND ALWAYS EXPECTED TO SEE HIM TUMBLE OVER THE CHAIRS BUMP AGAINST THE TABLES AND KNOCK DOWN ANY SMALL ARTICLES NEAR HIM HE BRAGGED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT WHAT HE COULD DO BUT SELDOM DID ANY THING TO PROVE IT WAS NOT BRAVE AND A LITTLE GIVEN TO TALE TELLING
DICK BROWN AND ADOLPHUS OR DOLLY PETTINGILL WERE TWO EIGHT YEAR OLDS DOLLY STUTTERED BADLY BUT WAS GRADUALLY GETTING OVER IT FOR NO ONE WAS ALLOWED TO MOCK HIM AND MISTER BHAER TRIED TO CURE IT BY MAKING HIM TALK SLOWLY DOLLY WAS A GOOD LITTLE LAD
DEAR ME HALF THE SCIENCE OF TEACHING IS KNOWING HOW MUCH CHILDREN DO FOR ONE ANOTHER AND WHEN TO MIX THEM
AS FULL OF MISCHIEF AS A MONKEY YET SO GOOD HEARTED THAT ONE COULD NOT HELP FORGIVING HIS TRICKS SO SCATTER BRAINED THAT WORDS WENT BY HIM LIKE THE WIND
LITTLE ANNIE HARDING WHAT NAUGHTY NAN AS THE LADS CALL HER CRIED MISTER BHAER LOOKING VERY MUCH AMUSED YES SHE IS RUNNING WILD AT HOME SINCE HER MOTHER DIED AND IS TOO BRIGHT A CHILD TO BE SPOILT BY SERVANTS
CRIED MISSUS JO TWEAKING HIM BY THE EAR JUST AS IF HE WAS ONE OF THE BOYS WON'T DAISY'S HAIR STAND ERECT WITH HORROR AT NAN'S WILD WAYS
REVELLING OVER ROBINSON CRUSOE ARABIAN NIGHTS EDGEWORTH'S TALES
ANOTHER HELPFUL THING HAPPENED IN A MOST UNEXPECTED AND AGREEABLE MANNER SEVERAL OF THE BOYS WERE IN BUSINESS AS THEY CALLED IT FOR MOST OF THEM WERE POOR AND KNOWING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN WAY TO MAKE BY AND BY THE BHAERS ENCOURAGED ANY EFFORTS AT INDEPENDENCE TOMMY SOLD HIS EGGS
SITTING DOWN BESIDE HIM WHILE FRANZ LED A CLASS OF SMALL STUDENTS THROUGH THE INTRICACIES OF THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE DO I AND NAT LOOKED UTTERLY INCREDULOUS YES FOR ONE THING YOU CAN KEEP YOUR TEMPER AND JACK WHO IS QUICK AT NUMBERS CANNOT THAT IS AN EXCELLENT LESSON
PERHAPS HIS LOVE OF MUSIC KEPT IT SWEET IN SPITE OF THE DISCORD ALL ABOUT HIM MISTER LAURIE SAID SO AND HE OUGHT TO KNOW HOWEVER THAT MIGHT BE FATHER BHAER TOOK PLEASURE IN FOSTERING POOR NAT'S VIRTUES AND IN CURING HIS FAULTS FINDING HIS NEW PUPIL AS DOCILE AND AFFECTIONATE AS A GIRL
WISH I HADN'T TOLD THOUGHT GOOD NATURED TOMMY FOR TO BE FERULED WAS THE DEEPEST DISGRACE AT THIS SCHOOL
GIVE THE RIGHT HAND LITTLE DAUGHTER AND MIND THY MANNERS HE ADDED AS NAN OFFERED HIM HER LEFT THE OTHER HURTS ME THE POOR LITTLE HAND
THAT I HAD TIME TO THINK AFTER THAT I WAS MORE CAREFUL AND GOT ON BETTER FOR I FEARED THE BIG SCISSORS
AND LOOK AT HIM WITH A FRIGHTENED FACE HE PUT THE LITTLE BOY DOWN SAYING GO TO THY MOTHER BUBCHEN I WILL COME SOON
PRETTY COBWEBS HE WAS SO FOND OF SPINNING IN THAT LITTLE BRAIN OF HIS TO BE SURE HE RATHER SHOCKED HIS MOTHER WHEN HE CAME HOME BY BANGING DOORS SAYING BY GEORGE EMPHATICALLY AND DEMANDING TALL THICK BOOTS THAT CLUMPED LIKE PAPA'S
THINKING THAT A LESSON IN LEARNING TO HELP ONE ANOTHER WAS BETTER THAN ARITHMETIC JUST THEN MISTER BHAER TOLD THEM ABOUT NAT MAKING SUCH AN INTERESTING AND TOUCHING LITTLE STORY OUT OF IT THAT THE GOOD HEARTED LADS ALL PROMISED TO LEND HIM A HAND
FOR BOYS HAVE A GREAT DEAL MORE DELICACY THAN THEY GET CREDIT FOR
PROUDLY PATTING THE OLD POCKETBOOK AND FEELING LIKE A MILLIONAIRE ALREADY HE WAS IN BUSINESS TRULY FOR PICNICS WERE PLENTY AS SUMMER OPENED AND NAT'S SKILL WAS IN GREAT DEMAND HE WAS ALWAYS AT LIBERTY TO GO IF LESSONS WERE NOT NEGLECTED AND IF THE PICNICKERS WERE RESPECTABLE YOUNG PEOPLE
A QUIET QUAINT BOY WAS DEMI SERIOUS YET CHEERY QUITE UNCONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS UNUSUALLY BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL YET QUICK TO SEE AND LOVE INTELLIGENCE OR BEAUTY IN OTHER CHILDREN VERY FOND OF BOOKS AND FULL OF LIVELY FANCIES BORN OF A STRONG IMAGINATION AND A SPIRITUAL NATURE
POVERTY DEMI WAS HIS LITTLE FRIEND TOMMY HIS PATRON AND DAISY THE COMFORTER OF ALL HIS WOES FOR THOUGH THE CHILDREN WERE YOUNGER THAN HE HIS TIMID SPIRIT FOUND A PLEASURE IN THEIR INNOCENT SOCIETY AND RATHER SHRUNK FROM THE ROUGH SPORTS OF THE ELDER LADS
BUT MISTER BHAER GAVE HIM A SEAT IN THE DEEP WINDOW WHERE HE COULD TURN HIS BACK ON THE OTHERS AND FRANZ HEARD HIM SAY HIS LESSONS THERE SO NO ONE COULD HEAR HIS BLUNDERS OR SEE HOW HE BLOTTED HIS COPYBOOK HE WAS TRULY GRATEFUL FOR THIS AND TOILED AWAY SO DILIGENTLY THAT MISTER BHAER SAID SMILING
AND HUGGING THE KIND HAND IN BOTH HIS OWN LAID HIS FACE DOWN ON IT SOBBING OUT IN A PASSION OF LOVE AND SHAME AND PENITENCE I WILL REMEMBER OH I WILL THEN MISTER BHAER PUT AN ARM ABOUT HIM AND SAID IN A TONE AS COMPASSIONATE AS IT HAD JUST NOW BEEN FIRM
NOT TASKING IT WITH LONG HARD LESSONS PARROT LEARNED BUT HELPING IT TO UNFOLD AS NATURALLY AND BEAUTIFULLY AS SUN AND DEW HELP ROSES BLOOM HE WAS NOT A PERFECT CHILD BY ANY MEANS BUT HIS FAULTS WERE OF THE BETTER SORT
POPPYDILLA TOMAHAWKED ALL THE OTHER DOLLS AND CAUSED THE NURSERY TO RUN RED WITH IMAGINARY GORE SHE GAVE AWAY HER NEW SHOES TO A BEGGAR CHILD HOPING TO BE ALLOWED TO GO BAREFOOT BUT FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COMBINE CHARITY AND COMFORT
IT WOULD BE LIKE HER AND MISTER BHAER CAUGHT UP HIS HAT TO GO AND FIND THE CHILD
AND NOW I DO SOMETIMES BECAUSE THE BOYS LAUGH AT ME I KNOW IT'S BAD BUT I FORGET AND NAT LOOKED MUCH DEPRESSED BY HIS SINS WHEN I WAS A LITTLE LAD I USED TO TELL LIES ACH WHAT FIBS THEY WERE
GO AND PICK THAT BUNCH OF NETTLES THEN AND STUFFY POINTED TO A STURDY SPECIMEN OF THAT PRICKLY PLANT GROWING BY THE WALL NAN INSTANTLY GRASPED THE NETTLE PULLED IT UP AND HELD IT WITH A DEFIANT GESTURE IN SPITE OF THE ALMOST UNBEARABLE STING
AND SHE WAS OFTEN FOUND SITTING ON THE STAIRS OUTSIDE NAT'S DOOR WHILE HE WAS PRACTISING THIS PLEASED HIM VERY MUCH AND HE PLAYED HIS BEST FOR THAT ONE QUIET LITTLE LISTENER FOR SHE NEVER WOULD COME IN BUT PREFERRED TO SIT SEWING HER GAY PATCHWORK OR TENDING ONE OF HER MANY DOLLS WITH AN EXPRESSION OF DREAMY PLEASURE ON HER FACE THAT MADE AUNT JO SAY
WIPING THE DUST OFF NAN'S LITTLE HOT FACE WELL I WON'T ONLY PAPA TELLS ME NOT TO PUT OFF DOING THINGS SO I DON'T
TOMMY GAVE HIS EVIDENCE AND MISTER BHAER HEARD IT
AND WHEN HE RECOVERED THE OVERTASKED BRAIN GAVE OUT
HE SAID HE WOULD GLADLY IF HE COULD FIND AS GOOD A SCHOOL FOR GIRLS AS OURS WAS FOR BOYS I KNOW HE WOULD REJOICE TO HAVE HER COME SO SUPPOSE WE DRIVE OVER THIS AFTERNOON AND SEE ABOUT IT
FOR NAN INVENTED THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PLAYS AND HER PRANKS RIVALLED TOMMY'S TO THE AMUSEMENT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL
BILLY WARD WAS WHAT THE SCOTCH TENDERLY CALL AN INNOCENT FOR THOUGH THIRTEEN YEARS OLD HE WAS LIKE A CHILD OF SIX
NAT DECLARED HE DIDN'T AND THEN WAS ASHAMED TO OWN UP THAT HE DID DO IT WHEN JACK WAS CHASING HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE HE THOUGHT NO ONE WOULD FIND IT OUT
DAY AFTER DAY HE PORED OVER THE ALPHABET PROUDLY SAID A AND B
THEN HE SAID ALOUD AND SO EARNESTLY THAT DEMI HEARD HIM I DO WANT TO LEARN AND I WILL TRY
OR PROPOSED ALL SORTS OF QUEER PUNISHMENTS TO BE INFLICTED UPON HIMSELF
THIS RATHER BELONGS TO YOUR SIDE OF THE HOUSE SO I WON'T MEDDLE WITH IT MY DEAR MISSUS JO KNEW WHAT HE MEANT BUT SHE LIKED HER LITTLE BLACK SHEEP ALL THE BETTER FOR HER PLUCK THOUGH SHE ONLY SAID IN HER SOBEREST WAY DO YOU KNOW WHY I ASKED NAN TO COME HERE
FOR HE WENT TO MISTER LAURENCE'S GREAT HOUSE SAW HIS PRETTY WIFE AND LITTLE FAIRY OF A DAUGHTER HAD A GOOD DINNER AND WAS MADE SO COMFORTABLE THAT HE TALKED AND DREAMED OF IT FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS AFTERWARD IT TAKES SO LITTLE TO MAKE A CHILD HAPPY THAT IT IS A PITY
THEY SHAN'T LAUGH AT YOU IF THEY DO I'LL I'LL TELL THEM NOT TO CRIED DEMI QUITE FORGETTING WHERE HE WAS THE CLASS STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF SEVEN TIMES NINE AND EVERYONE LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON
HE DROPPED A HOT CENT DOWN MARY ANN'S BACK AS THAT PRETTY MAID WAS WAITING AT TABLE ONE DAY WHEN THERE WERE GENTLEMEN TO DINNER WHEREAT THE POOR GIRL UPSET THE SOUP AND RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM IN DISMAY LEAVING THE FAMILY TO THINK THAT SHE HAD GONE MAD
SEE NOW WHEN YOU TELL A LIE I WILL NOT PUNISH YOU BUT YOU SHALL PUNISH ME HOW ASKED NAT STARTLED AT THE IDEA YOU SHALL FERULE ME IN THE GOOD OLD FASHIONED WAY I SELDOM DO IT MYSELF BUT IT MAY MAKE YOU REMEMBER BETTER TO GIVE ME PAIN THAN TO FEEL IT YOURSELF
NOT VERY BLACK ONES SELDOM GETTING DEEPER THAN GRAY AND OFTEN THE MILDEST OF WHITE FIBS BUT THAT DID NOT MATTER A LIE IS A LIE AND THOUGH WE ALL TELL MANY POLITE UNTRUTHS IN THIS QUEER WORLD OF OURS IT IS NOT RIGHT AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT
HER FIRST REMARK IN THE MORNING WAS HAS MY BOX COME
THEN YOU CAN PLAY THE VIOLIN AND NOT ONE OF THE LADS CAN THOUGH THEY WANT TO DO IT VERY MUCH BUT BEST OF ALL NAT YOU REALLY CARE TO LEARN SOMETHING AND THAT IS HALF THE BATTLE
TILL DAISY WAS SHOCKED SHE MANAGED TO EXIST HOWEVER TILL FIVE O'CLOCK WHEN SHE DISAPPEARED
THAT SPOILED HER CLEAN FROCK AND HURT HER LITTLE FEELINGS VERY MUCH HE PUT ROUGH WHITE PEBBLES IN THE SUGAR BOWL WHEN HIS GRANDMOTHER CAME TO TEA
WHEN HE SAW HIS HOT FACE AND INKY FINGERS DON'T WORK SO HARD MY BOY YOU WILL TIRE YOURSELF OUT AND THERE IS TIME ENOUGH
AND WAS ORDERED TO ASK LEAVE BEFORE DISPOSING OF HER CLOTHES SHE DELIGHTED THE BOYS BY MAKING A FIRE SHIP OUT OF A SHINGLE WITH TWO LARGE SAILS WET WITH TURPENTINE
SHE COULD NOT GET ON WITHOUT HER LITTLE WORK BASKET AND BITS OF SEWING WHICH SHE DID SO NICELY THAT DEMI FREQUENTLY PULLED OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF DISPLAY HER NEAT STITCHES AND BABY JOSY HAD A FLANNEL PETTICOAT BEAUTIFULLY MADE BY SISTER DAISY
YES SHE'S SOMEWHERE ROUND RETURNED NAN WITH MOST UNMATERNAL CARELESSNESS I MADE YOU A RING COMING ALONG AND PULLED THE HAIRS OUT OF DOBBIN'S TAIL DON'T YOU WANT IT
GOOD FOR YOU CRIED THE BOYS QUICK TO ACKNOWLEDGE COURAGE EVEN IN ONE OF THE WEAKER SEX MORE NETTLED THAN SHE WAS STUFFY DETERMINED TO GET A CRY OUT OF HER SOMEHOW AND HE SAID TAUNTINGLY YOU ARE USED TO POKING YOUR HANDS INTO EVERY THING SO THAT ISN'T FAIR
BUT KEPT HERSELF QUIET AND REFRAINED FROM TICKLING DEMI THOUGH STRONGLY TEMPTED TO DO SO BECAUSE OF THE DIGNIFIED AIRS HE PUT ON
NEVER MIND IF SHE DID IT IS AWFULLY MEAN TO HURT A LITTLE GIRL SAID DEMI REPROACHFULLY HO I DON'T MIND I AIN'T A LITTLE GIRL I'M OLDER THAN YOU AND DAISY SO NOW CRIED NAN UNGRATEFULLY DON'T PREACH DEACON YOU BULLY POSY EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE
NAT DID NOT COME TO DINNER BUT MISSUS JO TOOK SOME UP TO HIM AND SAID A TENDER WORD WHICH DID HIM GOOD THOUGH HE COULD NOT LOOK AT HER BY AND BY THE LADS PLAYING OUTSIDE HEARD THE VIOLIN AND SAID AMONG THEMSELVES HE'S ALL RIGHT NOW HE WAS ALL RIGHT BUT FELT SHY ABOUT GOING DOWN
IS SHE GOING TO BE A LITTLE GENTLEMAN TOO ASKED ROB SHE'D LIKE IT WOULDN'T YOU NAN ADDED TOMMY NO I SHOULDN'T I HATE BOYS SAID NAN FIERCELY
WHEN IN DISGRACE GENTLE LITTLE DAISY WAS THEIR MOST CONGENIAL FRIEND
I THINK YOU WILL ASK THE DEAR GOD TO HELP YOU AND TRY TO SPARE US BOTH ANOTHER SCENE LIKE THIS TOMMY SAW NO MORE FOR HE CREPT BACK TO THE HALL LOOKING SO EXCITED AND SOBER THAT THE BOYS CROWDED ROUND HIM TO ASK WHAT WAS BEING DONE TO NAT
SAID TENDER HEARTED TOMMY OF COURSE WE WON'T BUT IT'S AWFUL TO TELL LIES AND DEMI LOOKED AS IF HE FOUND THE AWFULNESS MUCH INCREASED WHEN THE PUNISHMENT FELL NOT UPON THE SINNER BUT HIS BEST UNCLE FRITZ
HERE STUFFY RETIRED INTO HIS BOWL AGAIN AND DID NOT EMERGE TILL DEMI MADE THEM ALL LAUGH BY SAYING IN HIS SLOW WONDERING WAY HOW CAN SHE WHEN SHE'S SUCH A TOMBOY THAT'S JUST IT SHE NEEDS HELP AS MUCH AS YOU AND I EXPECT YOU SET HER AN EXAMPLE OF GOOD MANNERS
WITH TEARS IN HER EYES SO LIKE MY BETH AND GO SOFTLY BY LEST EVEN HER FAMILIAR PRESENCE MAR THE CHILD'S SWEET SATISFACTION NAT WAS VERY FOND OF MISSUS BHAER BUT FOUND SOMETHING EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE IN THE GOOD PROFESSOR WHO TOOK FATHERLY CARE OF THE SHY FEEBLE BOY
BUT JOHN REJOICED OVER HIM LAUGHED AT HIS EXPLOSIVE REMARKS GOT THE BOOTS AND SAID CONTENTEDLY HE IS DOING WELL SO LET HIM CLUMP I WANT MY SON TO BE A MANLY BOY AND THIS TEMPORARY ROUGHNESS WON'T HURT HIM WE CAN POLISH HIM UP BY AND BY
SHE IS FULL OF SPIRITS AND ONLY NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT WHAT TO DO WITH THEM TO BE AS NICE A LITTLE GIRL AS DAISY THOSE QUICK WITS OF HERS WOULD ENJOY LESSONS IF THEY WERE RIGHTLY DIRECTED AND WHAT IS NOW A TRICKSY MIDGET WOULD SOON BECOME A BUSY HAPPY CHILD
GIVING HIM ALL SORTS OF HARD LESSONS KEEPING AT HIS BOOKS SIX HOURS A DAY AND EXPECTING HIM TO ABSORB KNOWLEDGE AS A STRASBURG GOOSE DOES THE FOOD CRAMMED DOWN ITS THROAT HE THOUGHT HE WAS DOING HIS DUTY BUT HE NEARLY KILLED THE BOY FOR A FEVER GAVE THE POOR CHILD A SAD HOLIDAY
WILL YOU TRY SAID NAN LONGING TO DISPLAY HER POWERS IT'S TOO HOT AND TOMMY LANGUISHED AGAINST THE WALL AS IF QUITE EXHAUSTED WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH STUFFY ASKED NAN WHOSE QUICK EYES WERE ROVING FROM FACE TO FACE BALL HURT HIS HAND
WHY DON'T HE UP AND TAKE IT LIKE A MAN I WOULD THOUGHT TOMMY THOUGH HIS HEART BEAT FAST AT THE SIGHT I SHALL KEEP MY WORD AND YOU MUST REMEMBER TO TELL THE TRUTH OBEY ME NAT TAKE THIS AND GIVE ME SIX GOOD STROKES
BUT IF YOU THINK IT WILL CURE ME I'LL LET YOU SNIP MY TONGUE SAID NAT HEROICALLY FOR HE DREADED PAIN YET DID WISH TO STOP FIBBING MISTER BHAER SMILED BUT SHOOK HIS HEAD
AS DICK AMBLED PAST HER LOOKING LIKE A VERY HAPPY BUT A VERY FEEBLE LITTLE DROMEDARY BESIDE STOUT STUFFY WHO DID THE ELEPHANT WITH PONDEROUS PROPRIETY JACK FORD WAS A SHARP RATHER A SLY LAD WHO WAS SENT TO THIS SCHOOL BECAUSE IT WAS CHEAP
MANY MEN WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIM A SMART BOY BUT MISTER BHAER DID NOT LIKE HIS WAY OF ILLUSTRATING THAT YANKEE WORD AND THOUGHT HIS UNBOYISH KEENNESS AND MONEY LOVING AS MUCH OF AN AFFLICTION AS DOLLY'S STUTTER OR DICK'S HUMP NED BARKER WAS LIKE A THOUSAND OTHER BOYS OF FOURTEEN ALL LEGS BLUNDER AND BLUSTER
OH I'M THE DROMEDARY DON'T YOU SEE THE HUMP ON MY BACK WAS THE LAUGHING ANSWER
YOU CANNOT BE TOO CAREFUL WATCH YOUR TONGUE AND EYES AND HANDS FOR IT IS EASY TO TELL AND LOOK AND ACT UNTRUTH
I CAN BEAT YOU IN RUNNING ANY WAY RETURNED NAN FALLING BACK ON HER STRONG POINT CAN SHE ASKED NAT OF JACK
JACK SPECULATED IN LIVE STOCK FRANZ HELPED IN THE TEACHING AND WAS PAID FOR IT NED HAD A TASTE FOR CARPENTRY
AS IF IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP STILL
THEN THEY MUST LEARN GENTLE WAYS AND IMPROVE THEIR MANNERS AND HAVING GIRLS ABOUT WILL DO IT BETTER THAN ANY THING ELSE YOU ARE RIGHT AS USUAL NOW WHO SHALL WE HAVE ASKED MISTER BHAER
I'D LIKE ONE IF THEY DO DICK WAS ALWAYS MERRY AND DID HIS BEST TO BE LIKE OTHER BOYS
IN A WORLD SO FULL OF SUNSHINE AND PLEASANT THINGS THAT THERE SHOULD BE ANY WISTFUL FACES EMPTY HANDS OR LONELY LITTLE HEARTS FEELING THIS THE BHAERS GATHERED UP ALL THE CRUMBS THEY COULD FIND TO FEED THEIR FLOCK OF HUNGRY SPARROWS FOR THEY WERE NOT RICH EXCEPT IN CHARITY
WHICH HE DISPLAYED WITH INTENSE SATISFACTION
NO I WANT TO SEE THE BOYS AND THE BARN AND RAN OFF SWINGING HER HAT BY ONE STRING TILL IT BROKE WHEN SHE LEFT IT TO ITS FATE ON THE GRASS HULLO NAN CRIED THE BOYS AS SHE BOUNCED IN AMONG THEM WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT I'M GOING TO STAY
THE BOYS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN SILENCE FOR A MINUTE
WITH MUCH CONGENIAL WORK ENCOURAGEMENT AND HOPE NAT FOUND LIFE GETTING EASIER AND HAPPIER EVERY DAY AND MADE SUCH PROGRESS IN HIS MUSIC LESSONS THAT HIS TEACHER FORGAVE HIS SLOWNESS IN SOME OTHER THINGS KNOWING VERY WELL THAT WHERE THE HEART IS THE MIND WORKS BEST
I'VE SOMETIMES FELT THAT MYSELF
HI DAISY WHERE ARE YOU DAISY CAME AND LOOKED PLEASED TO SEE HER GUEST
FOR MISTER BHAER EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT A GOOD PLAIN EDUCATION IS NECESSARY FOR EVERYONE AND THAT NO AMOUNT OF MONEY SHOULD HIRE HIM TO GO WHERE HE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO DO WRONG NAT QUITE AGREED TO THIS AND IT WAS A PLEASANT SIGHT TO SEE THE INNOCENT HEARTED LAD GO DRIVING AWAY IN THE GAY WAGONS THAT STOPPED AT THE GATE FOR HIM
THESE TRAITS MADE HIS PARENTS ANXIOUS TO BALANCE THEM WITH USEFUL KNOWLEDGE AND HEALTHFUL SOCIETY LEST THEY SHOULD MAKE HIM ONE OF THOSE PALE PRECOCIOUS CHILDREN WHO AMAZE AND DELIGHT A FAMILY SOMETIMES AND FADE AWAY LIKE HOT HOUSE FLOWERS
MISSUS JO SELDOM STIRRED WITHOUT HIM SO HE HAD HIS LITTLE FINGER IN ALL THE DOMESTIC PIES
SO DON'T HURRY HIM DAISY WAS AS SUNSHINY AND CHARMING AS EVER WITH ALL SORTS OF WOMANLINESSES BUDDING IN HER FOR SHE WAS LIKE HER GENTLE MOTHER AND DELIGHTED IN DOMESTIC THINGS SHE HAD A FAMILY OF DOLLS WHOM SHE BROUGHT UP IN THE MOST EXEMPLARY MANNER
AND HUNG ALL OVER WITH DAISY CHAINS MADE BY HIS LITTLE PLAYMATE WHILE HE LAY ON THE GRASS AND TOLD HER STORIES NO ONE SAID A WORD ABOUT THE SCENE OF THE MORNING BUT ITS EFFECT WAS ALL THE MORE LASTING FOR THAT REASON PERHAPS
REPAIRING FURNITURE ANIMALS AND GAMES WHILE DAISY WAS DRESSMAKER TO THE DILAPIDATED DOLLS AS FAST AS THE TOYS WERE MENDED
TOMMY BANGS WAS THE SCAPEGRACE OF THE SCHOOL
DON'T SEE HOW THE STATION MASTER LET YOU HAVE IT SAID TOMMY
MY POOR DAN I NEVER CAN QUITE FORGIVE MYSELF FOR LETTING HIM GO SIGHED MISSUS BHAER AT THE SOUND OF THE NAME LITTLE TEDDY WHO HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN HIS FRIEND STRUGGLED DOWN FROM HIS FATHER'S ARMS AND TROTTED TO THE DOOR LOOKED OUT OVER THE SUNNY LAWN WITH A WISTFUL FACE
THERE WAS MISS NAN TO BE SURE TUGGING ALONG A VERY LARGE BAND BOX TIED UP IN LINEN BAG VERY HOT AND DUSTY AND TIRED DID SHE LOOK
MISTER LAURENCE DID NOT FORGET HIM BUT SENT CLOTHES AND BOOKS MUSIC AND KIND MESSAGES AND NOW AND THEN CAME OUT TO SEE HOW HIS BOY WAS GETTING ON OR TOOK HIM INTO TOWN TO A CONCERT ON WHICH OCCASIONS NAT FELT HIMSELF TRANSLATED INTO THE SEVENTH HEAVEN OF BLISS
FEEDING THEM WITH A DOLL'S SPOON AND MOURNING OVER THEM WHEN THEY DIED TILL SHE WAS CONSOLED BY ONE OF DEMI'S BEST TURTLES
AND WAS DESPERATELY ACCURATE FOR MISTER BHAER JUDGED RIGHTLY
HE FOUGHT HER BATTLES VALIANTLY AND NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND WHY BOYS SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SAY RIGHT OUT THAT THEY LOVED THEIR SISTERS DAISY ADORED HER TWIN THOUGHT MY BROTHER THE MOST REMARKABLE BOY IN THE WORLD AND EVERY MORNING IN HER LITTLE WRAPPER
ANOTHER TIME YOU MUST WAIT FOR YOU WILL GET INTO TROUBLE IF YOU RUN AWAY
AND IN MENDING THESE NAT FOUND AN EMPLOYMENT THAT JUST SUITED HIM HE WAS VERY NEAT AND SKILLFUL WITH THOSE SLENDER FINGERS OF HIS AND PASSED MANY A RAINY AFTERNOON WITH HIS GUM BOTTLE PAINT BOX AND KNIFE
AND HER TINY HANDS FOREVER OUTSTRETCHED IN GIVING SUCH A GENEROUS LITTLE CREATURE YOU NEVER SAW A SPOONFUL OF BREAD AND MILK HAD ALWAYS TO BE TAKEN BY MAMA OR NURSE BEFORE CAROL COULD ENJOY HER SUPPER AND WHATEVER BIT OF CAKE OR SWEETMEAT FOUND ITS WAY INTO HER PRETTY FINGERS
HITHERTO HE HAD FELT KEENLY THE DANGER THAT SOME OTHER MAN MIGHT STEP IN AND GET POSSESSION OF HETTY'S HEART AND HAND WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS STILL IN A POSITION THAT MADE HIM SHRINK FROM ASKING HER TO ACCEPT HIM EVEN IF HE HAD HAD A STRONG HOPE THAT SHE WAS FOND OF HIM
THERE WAS A CHEERFUL OPEN FIRE IN THE GRATE BUT THOUGH THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED THE SIDE WINDOWS THAT LOOKED OUT ON THE CHURCH OF OUR SAVIOUR NEXT DOOR WERE WIDE OPEN SUDDENLY A SOUND OF MUSIC POURED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT AIR AND DRIFTED INTO THE CHAMBER
AND ANYWAY I'M IN A HURRY MY HIRED BOY WENT HOME TO DAY
THE HITHERTO BABY IF THAT IS A POSSIBLE TERM SAT IN ONE CORNER AND SAID NOTHING BUT FELT IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY THAT HIS NOSE WAS OUT OF JOINT FOR THERE WAS A NEWER BABY NOW A POSSIBILITY HE HAD NEVER TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND THE FIRST GIRL TOO
THE PARTNERSHIP WITH JONATHAN BURGE WAS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF AT PRESENT THERE WERE THINGS IMPLICITLY TACKED TO IT THAT HE COULD NOT ACCEPT BUT ADAM THOUGHT THAT HE AND SETH MIGHT CARRY ON A LITTLE BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES IN ADDITION TO THEIR JOURNEYMAN'S WORK
WITH SUCH AN INGENIOUS ARRANGEMENT OF SLIDING DOORS AND BOLTS SUCH CONVENIENT NOOKS FOR STOWING HOUSEHOLD PROVENDER AND SUCH A SYMMETRICAL RESULT TO THE EYE THAT EVERY GOOD HOUSEWIFE WOULD BE IN RAPTURES WITH IT AND FALL THROUGH ALL THE GRADATIONS OF MELANCHOLY LONGING TILL HER HUSBAND PROMISED TO BUY IT FOR HER
SO LONG AS HE HAD NO OTHER PROSPECT THAN THAT OF GROWING POVERTY WITH A GROWING FAMILY AND HIS SAVINGS HAD BEEN SO CONSTANTLY DRAWN UPON BESIDES THE TERRIBLE SWEEP OF PAYING FOR SETH'S SUBSTITUTE IN THE MILITIA THAT HE HAD NOT ENOUGH MONEY BEFOREHAND TO FURNISH EVEN A SMALL COTTAGE
ADAM YOU PERCEIVE WAS BY NO MEANS A MARVELLOUS MAN NOR PROPERLY SPEAKING A GENIUS YET I WILL NOT PRETEND THAT HIS WAS AN ORDINARY CHARACTER AMONG WORKMEN
HE HAD TOO LITTLE FELLOW FEELING WITH THE WEAKNESS THAT ERRS IN SPITE OF FORESEEN CONSEQUENCES WITHOUT THIS FELLOW FEELING HOW ARE WE TO GET ENOUGH PATIENCE AND CHARITY TOWARDS OUR STUMBLING FALLING COMPANIONS IN THE LONG AND CHANGEFUL JOURNEY
AND HIS HOPE WAS FAR FROM BEING STRONG HE HAD BEEN TOO HEAVILY BURDENED WITH OTHER CLAIMS TO PROVIDE A HOME FOR HIMSELF AND HETTY A HOME SUCH AS HE COULD EXPECT HER TO BE CONTENT WITH AFTER THE COMFORT AND PLENTY OF THE FARM
SOME APPLICATION OF MINERAL PRODUCE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN FARMING PRACTICE SOME REFORM OF PARISH ABUSES WITH WHICH THEIR NAMES ARE ASSOCIATED BY ONE OR TWO GENERATIONS AFTER THEM THEIR EMPLOYERS WERE THE RICHER FOR THEM THE WORK OF THEIR HANDS HAS WORN WELL
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO COME TO ANY BUT FLUCTUATING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HETTY'S FEELINGS SHE WAS LIKE A KITTEN AND HAD THE SAME DISTRACTINGLY PRETTY LOOKS THAT MEANT NOTHING FOR EVERYBODY THAT CAME NEAR HER
WITH SLANTING RAYS THAT TREMBLE BETWEEN THE DELICATE SHADOWS OF THE LEAVES HE THOUGHT YESTERDAY WHEN HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO HER AS THEY CAME OUT OF CHURCH THAT THERE WAS A TOUCH OF MELANCHOLY KINDNESS IN HER FACE SUCH AS HE HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE
TO SPELL WITHOUT ANY OTHER MISTAKES THAN MUST IN FAIRNESS BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE UNREASONABLE CHARACTER OF ORTHOGRAPHY RATHER THAN TO ANY DEFICIENCY IN THE SPELLER AND MOREOVER TO LEARN HIS MUSICAL NOTES AND PART SINGING
AN A FOOL ULL HIT ON'T SOMETIMES WHEN A WISE MAN MISSES THAT'S WHY THE ALMANECKS GET SO MUCH CREDIT IT'S ONE O THEM CHANCY THINGS AS FOOLS THRIVE ON
LAY IN THE FACT THAT MISSUS BIRD NEVER ALLOWED HER BABIES TO GO OVER NIGHT UNNAMED SHE WAS A PERSON OF SO GREAT DECISION OF CHARACTER THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BLUSHED AT SUCH A THING SHE SAID THAT TO LET BLESSED BABIES GO DANGLING AND DAWDLING ABOUT WITHOUT NAMES FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS
APPARENTLY CROSSED BY SOME THOUGHT WHICH JARS WITH THE SINGING PERHAPS IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN ALREADY IN THE SECRET YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE GUESSED WHAT SAD MEMORIES WHAT WARM AFFECTION WHAT TENDER FLUTTERING HOPES HAD THEIR HOME IN THIS ATHLETIC BODY WITH THE BROKEN FINGER NAILS
TOSSED ABOUT LIKE TRODDEN MEADOW GRASS WHENEVER HE TAKES OFF HIS PAPER CAP AND WITH THE STRONG BARYTONE VOICE BURSTING EVERY NOW AND THEN INTO LOUD AND SOLEMN PSALM TUNES AS IF SEEKING AN OUTLET FOR SUPERFLUOUS STRENGTH YET PRESENTLY CHECKING HIMSELF
WHICH IN THE WESTERING SUN WAS A TREMULOUS SPLENDOUR WITH A SEA OF UNDERGROWTH WAVERED INTO GOLDEN BILLOWS BY EVERY PASSING WIND OLD ROBERT WILLIAMSON SAT OPPOSITE HIM ON A BENCH HE WAS A SMALL LEAN OLD MAN
MOST COMMONLY AS PAINSTAKING HONEST MEN WITH THE SKILL AND CONSCIENCE TO DO WELL THE TASKS THAT LIE BEFORE THEM THEIR LIVES HAVE NO DISCERNIBLE ECHO BEYOND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE THEY DWELT BUT YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO FIND THERE SOME GOOD PIECE OF ROAD SOME BUILDING
A STILL HIGHER DEVELOPMENT OF TREASON WHICH MADE HIM ACTUALLY GREEN WITH JEALOUSY BUT IT WAS TOO PROFOUND A SUBJECT TO BE SETTLED THEN AND THERE ON THE SPOT BESIDES
IT WOULD ALWAYS BE A HARD STRUGGLE WITH HIS MOTHER HE KNEW SHE WOULD BE JEALOUS OF ANY WIFE HE MIGHT CHOOSE AND SHE HAD SET HER MIND ESPECIALLY AGAINST HETTY PERHAPS FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT SHE SUSPECTED HETTY TO BE THE WOMAN HE HAD CHOSEN
MEANWHILE DEAR MISSUS BIRD LAY IN HER ROOM WEAK BUT SAFE AND HAPPY WITH HER SWEET GIRL BABY BY HER SIDE AND THE HEAVEN OF MOTHERHOOD OPENING BEFORE HER NURSE WAS MAKING GRUEL IN THE KITCHEN AND THE ROOM WAS DIM AND QUIET
BANGED HIS HEAD AGAINST THE RAILING A FEW TIMES JUST BY WAY OF UNCORKING THE VIALS OF HIS WRATH AND THEN SUBSIDED INTO GLOOMY SILENCE WAITING TO DECLARE WAR IF MORE FIRST GIRL BABIES WERE THRUST UPON A FAMILY ALREADY SURFEITED WITH THAT UNNECESSARY ARTICLE
WHEN THERE IS JUST A LINGERING HINT OF EARLY COOLNESS TO KEEP OFF LANGUOR UNDER THE DELICIOUS INFLUENCE OF WARMTH THE REASON ADAM WAS WALKING ALONG THE LANES AT THIS TIME WAS BECAUSE HIS WORK FOR THE REST OF THE DAY LAY AT A COUNTRY HOUSE ABOUT THREE MILES OFF
SO DONALD TOOK HIS NEW VELOCIPEDE AND WENT OUT TO RIDE UP AND DOWN THE STONE PAVEMENT AND NOTCH THE SHINS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE AS THEY PASSED BY WHILE PAUL SPUN HIS MUSICAL TOP ON THE FRONT STEPS BUT HUGH REFUSED TO LEAVE THE SCENE OF ACTION HE SEATED HIMSELF ON THE TOP STAIR IN THE HALL
AND PRAY A GLADSOME CHRISTMAS FOR ALL YOUR FELLOW MEN
BUT ADAM HAD NO SOONER CAUGHT HIS IMAGINATION LEAPING FORWARD IN THIS WAY MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE THAN HE CHECKED HIMSELF A PRETTY BUILDING I'M MAKING WITHOUT EITHER BRICKS OR TIMBER I'M UP THE GARRET A'READY AND HAVEN'T SO MUCH AS DUG THE FOUNDATION
THE STRONG FIBRES BEGIN THEIR ACCUSTOMED THRILL AND WHAT WAS A MOMENT BEFORE JOY VEXATION OR AMBITION BEGINS ITS CHANGE INTO ENERGY ALL PASSION BECOMES STRENGTH WHEN IT HAS AN OUTLET FROM THE NARROW LIMITS OF OUR PERSONAL LOT
WELL THESE PEDDLERS WERE MAN AND WIFE AND THE WOMAN TOOK SICK UP THERE AT THE GORDON PLACE AND JANET GORDON TOOK HER IN AND NURSED HER A BABY WAS BORN THE NEXT DAY AND THE WOMAN DIED THEN THE FIRST THING ANYBODY KNEW THE FATHER SKIPPED CLEAN OUT PACK AND ALL
AND KEEP SOMETHING IN RESERVE AGAINST A RAINY DAY HE HAD GOOD HOPE THAT HE SHOULD BE FIRMER ON HIS LEGS BY AND BY BUT HE COULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH A VAGUE CONFIDENCE IN HIS ARM AND BRAIN HE MUST HAVE DEFINITE PLANS AND SET ABOUT THEM AT ONCE
ADAM PICTURED TO HIMSELF MISSUS POYSER EXAMINING IT WITH HER KEEN EYE AND TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND OUT A DEFICIENCY AND OF COURSE CLOSE TO MISSUS POYSER STOOD HETTY AND ADAM WAS AGAIN BEGUILED FROM CALCULATIONS AND CONTRIVANCES INTO DREAMS AND HOPES
IT WOULD NEVER DO HE FEARED FOR HIS MOTHER TO LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS MARRIED AND YET HOW HARD SHE WOULD THINK IT IF HE ASKED HER TO LEAVE HIM YES THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN TO BE GONE THROUGH WITH HIS MOTHER
THIS UNREASONABLE BEHAVIOUR OF THE WEATHER HOWEVER COULD DISPLEASE NO ONE ELSE IN HAYSLOPE BESIDES MISTER CRAIG ALL HANDS WERE TO BE OUT IN THE MEADOWS THIS MORNING AS SOON AS THE DEW HAD RISEN
BUT UNLESS HE COULD MANAGE BOTH VISITS THIS LAST MUST BE PUT OFF TILL TO MORROW THE DESIRE TO BE NEAR HETTY AND TO SPEAK TO HER AGAIN WAS TOO STRONG AS HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO THIS HE WAS COMING VERY NEAR TO THE END OF HIS WALK
THEY KEPT THE BABY THEY CALLED HIM NEIL AND HAD HIM BAPTIZED SAME AS ANY CHRISTIAN CHILD HE'S ALWAYS LIVED THERE THEY DID WELL ENOUGH BY HIM HE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AND TAKEN TO CHURCH AND TREATED LIKE ONE OF THEMSELVES SOME FOLKS THINK THEY MADE TOO MUCH OF HIM
WHISTLING LOW WHILE HE CONSIDERS HOW A DIFFICULTY ABOUT A FLOOR JOIST OR A WINDOW FRAME IS TO BE OVERCOME OR AS HE PUSHES ONE OF THE YOUNGER WORKMEN ASIDE AND TAKES HIS PLACE IN UPHEAVING A WEIGHT OF TIMBER SAYING LET ALONE LAD
SPEAKING OF TEA DO YOU KNOW MISSUS ADAM PALMER AND MISSUS JIM MARTIN TOOK TEA TOGETHER AT FOSTER REID'S LAST WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON NO WHY I THOUGHT THEY WERE ON BAD TERMS SAID MISSUS WILLIAMSON BETRAYING A LITTLE FEMININE CURIOSITY
AND WAS NEVER SEEN OR HEARD TELL OF AFTERWARDS THE GORDONS WERE LEFT WITH THE FINE YOUNGSTER TO THEIR HANDS FOLKS ADVISED THEM TO SEND HIM TO THE ORPHAN ASYLUM AND TWOULD HAVE BEEN THE WISEST PLAN BUT THE GORDONS WERE NEVER FOND OF TAKING ADVICE
BUT NOW HE COULD NOT HELP SAYING TO HIMSELF THAT THE HEAVIEST PART OF HIS BURDEN WAS REMOVED AND THAT EVEN BEFORE THE END OF ANOTHER YEAR HIS CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT BE BROUGHT INTO A SHAPE THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO THINK OF MARRYING
LORD MASTER THINK OF IT WHAT CHANCT WOULD A POOR MOUSE HAVE NONE OF THE REST OF US ARE QUEER LEASTWISE WE HAIN'T FOUND IT OUT IF WE ARE BUT THEN WE'RE MIGHTY UNINTERESTING I'M BOUND TO ADMIT THAT WHERE DO THE GORDONS LIVE ASKED ERIC
WITHIN THE SOUND OF THE HAMMERS AT WORK ON THE REFITTING OF THE OLD HOUSE THE SOUND OF TOOLS TO A CLEVER WORKMAN WHO LOVES HIS WORK IS LIKE THE TENTATIVE SOUNDS OF THE ORCHESTRA TO THE VIOLINIST WHO HAS TO BEAR HIS PART IN THE OVERTURE
HOW HAS IT HAPPENED THAT AN ITALIAN BOY WITH A SCOTCH NAME IS LIVING IN A PLACE LIKE LINDSAY WELL MASTER IT WAS THIS WAY ABOUT TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO WAS IT TWENTY TWO MOTHER OR TWENTY FOUR YES IT WAS TWENTY TWO
PAUL CHOSE LUELLA FOR LUELLA WAS THE NURSE WHO HAD BEEN WITH HIM DURING HIS WHOLE BABYHOOD UP TO THE TIME OF HIS FIRST TROUSERS AND THE NAME SUGGESTED ALL SORTS OF COMFORTABLE THINGS UNCLE JACK SAID THAT THE FIRST GIRL SHOULD ALWAYS BE NAMED FOR HER MOTHER NO MATTER HOW HIDEOUS THE NAME HAPPENED TO BE
NO HE'S A ROUND JOLLY FELLOW IS ALECK AND HE STOPPED GROWING PRETTY MUCH BEFORE HE'D EVER BEGUN I RECKON THE MAN YOU MEAN IS THOMAS GORDON I SEEN HIM DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD TOO
AND PART OF A HISTORY OF BABYLON WHICH BARTLE MASSEY HAD LENT HIM HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MANY MORE BOOKS FROM BARTLE MASSEY BUT HE HAD NO TIME FOR READING THE COMMIN PRINT AS LISBETH CALLED IT SO BUSY AS HE WAS WITH FIGURES IN ALL THE LEISURE MOMENTS WHICH HE DID NOT FILL UP WITH EXTRA CARPENTRY
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS DO WITH THAT KIND FOR WHAT'S BRED IN BONE IS MIGHTY APT TO COME OUT IN FLESH IF TAINT KEPT DOWN PRETTY WELL NEIL'S SMART AND A GREAT WORKER THEY TELL ME BUT FOLKS HEREABOUTS DON'T LIKE HIM
BUT IT WAS A CASE IN WHICH HE MUST MAKE HER FEEL THAT HIS WILL WAS STRONG
LIKE ALL STRONG NATURES ADAM HAD CONFIDENCE IN HIS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE HE FELT SURE HE SHOULD SOME DAY IF HE LIVED BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A FAMILY AND MAKE A GOOD BROAD PATH FOR HIMSELF
THEY SAY HE AIN'T TO BE TRUSTED FURTHER'N YOU CAN SEE HIM IF AS FAR IT'S CERTAIN HE'S AWFUL HOT TEMPERED AND ONE TIME WHEN HE WAS GOING TO SCHOOL HE NEAR ABOUT KILLED A BOY HE'D TOOK A SPITE TO CHOKED HIM TILL HE WAS BLACK IN THE FACE AND NEIL HAD TO BE DRAGGED OFF
I S'POSE YOU DON'T WANT ANY OF THIS NOR YOU NOR YOU MOTHER ALECK SAYS OLD GEORGE WRIGHT IS HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE HIS WIFE HAS GONE TO CHARLOTTETOWN TO VISIT HER SISTER AND HE IS HIS OWN BOSS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE WAS MARRIED FORTY YEARS AGO
THE BOY LOOKS LIKE AN ITALIAN WELL NOW YOU KNOW MASTER I RECKON IT'S LIKELY HE DOES SEEING THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE IS YOU'VE HIT THE NAIL SQUARE ON THE HEAD ITALYUN YES SIR RATHER TOO MUCH SO I'M THINKING FOR DECENT FOLKS TASTE
HALF LOST IN LOOSE CLOTHES THAT SEEMED FAR TOO LARGE FOR HIM WHEN HE SPOKE HIS VOICE WAS AS THIN AND SQUEAKY AS HE APPEARED TO BE HIMSELF THE OTHER END OF THE BENCH WAS OCCUPIED BY TIMOTHY SLEEK AND COMPLACENT WITH A SNOWY BREAST AND WHITE PAWS
WAS ENOUGH TO RUIN THEM FOR LIFE SHE ALSO SAID THAT IF ONE COULD NOT MAKE UP ONE'S MIND IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT WAS A SIGN THAT BUT I WILL NOT REPEAT THE REST AS IT MIGHT PREJUDICE YOU AGAINST THE MOST CHARMING WOMAN IN THE WORLD
OF COURSE IT WAS THOUGHT FOOLISH BY MANY PEOPLE THOUGH UNCLE JACK DECLARED LAUGHINGLY THAT IT WAS VERY STRANGE IF A WHOLE FAMILY OF BIRDS COULD NOT BE INDULGED IN A SINGLE CAROL AND GRANDMA WHO ADORED THE CHILD THOUGHT THE NAME MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE THAN LUCY
IN THIS ROUGH MAN WHO KNEW NO BETTER LYRICS THAN HE COULD FIND IN THE OLD AND NEW VERSION AND AN OCCASIONAL HYMN WHO KNEW THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF PROFANE HISTORY AND FOR WHOM THE MOTION AND SHAPE OF THE EARTH
WITH AN INHERITANCE OF AFFECTIONS NURTURED BY A SIMPLE FAMILY LIFE OF COMMON NEED AND COMMON INDUSTRY AND AN INHERITANCE OF FACULTIES TRAINED IN SKILFUL COURAGEOUS LABOUR THEY MAKE THEIR WAY UPWARDS RARELY AS GENIUSES
THEY'RE ALWAYS GOOD BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER TELLS THEM EVERY SUNDAY THAT THEY'LL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL IF THEY DON'T BEHAVE IN SCHOOL IT'S EFFECTIVE TAKE SOME PRESERVE MASTER YOU KNOW WE DON'T HELP THINGS HERE THE WAY MISSUS ADAM SCOTT DOES WHEN SHE HAS BOARDERS
BUT YOU'RE LIKE OLD AUNT NANCY SCOTT YOU NEVER SAY ANYTHING UNCHARITABLE EXCEPT IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS YOU KNOW THE GORDONS AIN'T LIKE OTHER PEOPLE AND NEVER WERE AND NEVER WILL BE THEY'RE ABOUT THE ONLY QUEER FOLKS WE HAVE IN LINDSAY MASTER EXCEPT OLD PETER COOK WHO KEEPS TWENTY FIVE CATS
BESIDES ALL THIS HE HAD READ HIS BIBLE INCLUDING THE APOCRYPHAL BOOKS POOR RICHARD'S ALMANAC TAYLOR'S HOLY LIVING AND DYING THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS WITH BUNYAN'S LIFE AND HOLY WAR A GREAT DEAL OF BAILEY'S DICTIONARY VALENTINE AND ORSON
MAMA HAD NOT BEEN ASKED AND EVERYBODY FELT IT RATHER ABSURD AFTER ALL TO FORESTALL A DECREE THAT WAS CERTAIN TO BE ABSOLUTELY WISE JUST AND PERFECT THE REASON THAT THE SUBJECT HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP AT ALL SO EARLY IN THE DAY
OLD JAMES GORDON WAS LIVING THEN THOMAS AND JANET'S FATHER AND HE SAID HE WOULD NEVER TURN A CHILD OUT OF HIS DOOR HE WAS A MASTERFUL OLD MAN AND LIKED TO BE BOSS FOLKS USED TO SAY HE HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST THE SUN CAUSE IT ROSE AND SET WITHOUT HIS SAY SO ANYHOW
SO THEY ARE SO THEY ARE BUT THEY BOTH HAPPENED TO VISIT MISSUS FOSTER THE SAME AFTERNOON AND NEITHER WOULD LEAVE BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE KNUCKLING DOWN TO THE OTHER SO THEY STUCK IT OUT ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE PARLOUR
MISSUS WILLIAMSON WAS THE SAINT IN SPECTACLES AND CALICO WHICH LARRY WEST HAD TERMED HER ERIC LIKED HER GREATLY SHE WAS A SLIGHT GRAY HAIRED WOMAN WITH A THIN SWEET HIGH BRED FACE
EVER CAME TO MARRY ROBERT WILLIAMSON SHE SMILED IN A MOTHERLY FASHION AT ERIC AS HE HUNG HIS HAT ON THE WHITE WASHED WALL AND TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE TABLE OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW BEHIND HIM WAS A BIRCH GROVE
TO AWAIT ITS ARRIVAL AND DIRECT THE WORKMEN THIS LITTLE WALK WAS A REST TO ADAM AND HE WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY UNDER THE CHARM OF THE MOMENT IT WAS SUMMER MORNING IN HIS HEART AND HE SAW HETTY IN THE SUNSHINE A SUNSHINE WITHOUT GLARE
WHENEVER ADAM WAS STRONGLY CONVINCED OF ANY PROPOSITION IT TOOK THE FORM OF A PRINCIPLE IN HIS MIND IT WAS KNOWLEDGE TO BE ACTED ON AS MUCH AS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT DAMP WILL CAUSE RUST PERHAPS HERE LAY THE SECRET OF THE HARDNESS HE HAD ACCUSED HIMSELF OF
WHY MY BABY WHISPERED MISSUS BIRD IN SOFT SURPRISE I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT DAY IT WAS YOU ARE A LITTLE CHRISTMAS CHILD AND WE WILL NAME YOU CAROL' MOTHER'S LITTLE CHRISTMAS CAROL
WHY DONALD DON'T YOU THINK CAROL IS A SWEET NAME FOR A CHRISTMAS BABY IT CAME TO ME JUST A MOMENT AGO IN THE SINGING AS I WAS LYING HERE HALF ASLEEP AND HALF AWAKE I THINK IT IS A CHARMING NAME DEAR HEART AND THAT IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE YOU
AND WAKENED IN THEM A GLAD SURPRISE AT THE MERRY WORLD SHE HAD COME TO LIVE IN HER CHEEKS AND LIPS WERE AS RED AS HOLLY BERRIES HER HAIR WAS FOR ALL THE WORLD THE COLOR OF A CHRISTMAS CANDLE FLAME HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AS STARS HER LAUGH LIKE A CHIME OF CHRISTMAS BELLS
YES HE WOULD GO AND SEE HER THIS EVENING IT WAS SO LONG SINCE HE HAD BEEN AT THE HALL FARM HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GO TO THE NIGHT SCHOOL TO SEE WHY BARTLE MASSEY HAD NOT BEEN AT CHURCH YESTERDAY FOR HE FEARED HIS OLD FRIEND WAS ILL
AND THE WORK OF THEIR BRAINS HAS GUIDED WELL THE HANDS OF OTHER MEN THEY WENT ABOUT IN THEIR YOUTH IN FLANNEL OR PAPER CAPS IN COATS BLACK WITH COAL DUST OR STREAKED WITH LIME AND RED PAINT IN OLD AGE THEIR WHITE HAIRS ARE SEEN IN A PLACE OF HONOUR AT CHURCH AND AT MARKET
THEY NEVER MISS THAT AND NOBODY GOES THERE THERE'S JUST OLD THOMAS AND HIS SISTER JANET AND A NIECE OF THEIRS AND THIS HERE NEIL WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THEY'RE A QUEER DOUR CRANKY LOT AND I WILL SAY IT MOTHER THERE GIVE YOUR OLD MAN A CUP OF TEA AND NEVER MIND THE WAY HIS TONGUE RUNS ON
NO SOONER HAD THIS LITTLE PLAN SHAPED ITSELF IN HIS MIND THAN HE BEGAN TO BE BUSY WITH EXACT CALCULATIONS ABOUT THE WOOD TO BE BOUGHT AND THE PARTICULAR ARTICLE OF FURNITURE THAT SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN FIRST A KITCHEN CUPBOARD OF HIS OWN CONTRIVANCE
AND HE TOOK IT AS A SIGN THAT SHE HAD SOME SYMPATHY WITH HIS FAMILY TROUBLE POOR FELLOW THAT TOUCH OF MELANCHOLY CAME FROM QUITE ANOTHER SOURCE BUT HOW WAS HE TO KNOW WE LOOK AT THE ONE LITTLE WOMAN'S FACE WE LOVE AS WE LOOK AT THE FACE OF OUR MOTHER EARTH
THEY WERE CONSULTING ABOUT IT IN THE NURSERY MISTER BIRD SAID THAT HE HAD ASSISTED IN NAMING THE THREE BOYS AND THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE THIS MATTER ENTIRELY TO MISSUS BIRD DONALD WANTED THE CHILD CALLED MAUD AFTER A PRETTY LITTLE CURLY HAIRED GIRL WHO SAT NEXT HIM IN SCHOOL
TO BE SURE IF SHE LOVED HIM VERY MUCH SHE WOULD BE CONTENT TO WAIT FOR HIM BUT DID SHE LOVE HIM HIS HOPES HAD NEVER RISEN SO HIGH THAT HE HAD DARED TO ASK HER HE WAS CLEAR SIGHTED ENOUGH TO BE AWARE THAT HER UNCLE AND AUNT WOULD HAVE LOOKED KINDLY ON HIS SUIT
TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT HE WAS A POOR COLLEGE STUDENT WORKING HIS WAY THROUGH AS LARRY WEST HAD BEEN DOING ERIC DID NOT DISTURB THIS BELIEF ALTHOUGH HE SAID NOTHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT THE WILLIAMSONS WERE AT TEA IN THE KITCHEN WHEN ERIC WENT IN
WELL NOW FATHER YOU KNOW THEY TEASED HIM TERRIBLE PROTESTED MISSUS WILLIAMSON THE POOR BOY HAD A REAL HARD TIME WHEN HE WENT TO SCHOOL MASTER THE OTHER CHILDREN WERE ALWAYS CASTING THINGS UP TO HIM AND CALLING HIM NAMES
HE'S ON A REGULAR ORGY ALECK SAYS HE SMOKES IN THE PARLOUR AND SITS UP TILL ELEVEN O'CLOCK READING DIME NOVELS PERHAPS I MET MISTER TRACY SAID ERIC IS HE A TALL MAN WITH GRAY HAIR AND A DARK STERN FACE
IT WAS THE BOY CHOIR SINGING CHRISTMAS ANTHEMS HIGHER AND HIGHER ROSE THE CLEAR FRESH VOICES FULL OF HOPE AND CHEER AS CHILDREN'S VOICES ALWAYS ARE FULLER AND FULLER GREW THE BURST OF MELODY AS ONE GLAD STRAIN FELL UPON ANOTHER IN JOYFUL HARMONY
WHICH WAS BEING PUT IN REPAIR FOR THE SON OF A NEIGHBOURING SQUIRE AND HE HAD BEEN BUSY SINCE EARLY MORNING WITH THE PACKING OF PANELS DOORS AND CHIMNEY PIECES IN A WAGGON WHICH WAS NOW GONE ON BEFORE HIM WHILE JONATHAN BURGE HIMSELF HAD RIDDEN TO THE SPOT ON HORSEBACK
IN THE LABOUR OF OUR RIGHT ARM THE CUNNING OF OUR RIGHT HAND OR THE STILL CREATIVE ACTIVITY OF OUR THOUGHT LOOK AT ADAM THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY AS HE STANDS ON THE SCAFFOLDING WITH THE TWO FEET RULER IN HIS HAND
AND A PAPER CAP ON HIS HEAD HAS THE STRONG CONSCIENCE AND THE STRONG SENSE THE BLENDED SUSCEPTIBILITY AND SELF COMMAND OF OUR FRIEND ADAM HE WAS NOT AN AVERAGE MAN YET SUCH MEN AS HE ARE REARED HERE AND THERE IN EVERY GENERATION OF OUR PEASANT ARTISANS
FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT THEY SHOULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER TILL SETH WAS MARRIED AND THEY MIGHT HAVE BUILT A BIT THEMSELVES TO THE OLD HOUSE AND MADE MORE ROOM
HE LEFT WORD FOR YOU TO GO UP AND HAVE A GAME SOME EVENING SOON DON'T BEAT HIM TOO OFTEN EVEN IF YOU CAN YOU'LL NEED TO STAND IN WITH HIM I TELL YOU MASTER FOR HE'S GOT A SON THAT MAY BREW TROUBLE FOR YOU WHEN HE STARTS IN TO GO TO SCHOOL
AND EVERYBODY SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT MISSUS BIRD HAD THOUGHT OF NAMING THE BABY LUCY FOR GRANDMA HERSELF AND WHILE IT WOULD BE INDELICATE FOR HER TO FAVOR THAT NAME IT WOULD BE AGAINST HUMAN NATURE FOR HER TO SUGGEST ANY OTHER UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES HUGH
DEEPLY LINED WITH THE RECORDS OF OUTLIVED PAIN SHE TALKED LITTLE AS A RULE BUT IN THE PUNGENT COUNTRY PHRASE SHE NEVER SPOKE BUT SHE SAID SOMETHING THE ONE THING THAT CONSTANTLY PUZZLED ERIC WAS HOW SUCH A WOMAN
BUT PEOPLE SAY THERE IS EVERYTHING IN A GOOD BEGINNING AND SHE MAY HAVE BREATHED IN UNCONSCIOUSLY THE FRAGRANCE OF EVERGREENS AND HOLIDAY DINNERS WHILE THE PEALS OF SLEIGH BELLS AND THE LAUGHTER OF HAPPY CHILDREN MAY HAVE FALLEN UPON HER BABY EARS
THE WIVES AND DAUGHTERS DID DOUBLE WORK IN EVERY FARMHOUSE THAT THE MAIDS MIGHT GIVE THEIR HELP IN TOSSING THE HAY AND WHEN ADAM WAS MARCHING ALONG THE LANES WITH HIS BASKET OF TOOLS OVER HIS SHOULDER HE CAUGHT THE SOUND OF JOCOSE TALK AND RINGING LAUGHTER FROM BEHIND THE HEDGES
A LITTLE CHILD WAS BORN IN THE BIRD HOUSEHOLD THEY HAD INTENDED TO NAME THE BABY LUCY IF IT WERE A GIRL BUT THEY HADN'T EXPECTED HER ON CHRISTMAS MORNING AND A REAL CHRISTMAS BABY WAS NOT TO BE LIGHTLY NAMED THE WHOLE FAMILY AGREED IN THAT
AFTER OLD ROBERT HAD TAKEN A MOUTHFUL OF ANYTHING HE GAVE A PIECE TO TIMOTHY WHO ATE IT DAINTILY AND PURRED RESONANT GRATITUDE YOU SEE WE'RE BUSY WAITING FOR YOU MASTER SAID OLD ROBERT YOU'RE LATE THIS EVENING KEEP ANY OF THE YOUNGSTERS IN
SMALL FEAR OF IT THE GORDONS AIN'T SOCIABLE TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT NO SIR MOTHER PASS THE BISCUITS TO THE MASTER WHO WAS THE YOUNG FELLOW HE HAD WITH HIM ASKED ERIC CURIOUSLY NEIL NEIL GORDON
AND ADAM IN HIS OVERHOURS COULD DO ALL THE NICE WORK THAT REQUIRED PECULIAR SKILL THE MONEY GAINED IN THIS WAY WITH THE GOOD WAGES HE RECEIVED AS FOREMAN WOULD SOON ENABLE THEM TO GET BEFOREHAND WITH THE WORLD SO SPARINGLY AS THEY WOULD ALL LIVE NOW
AND I HOPE THAT BEING A GIRL THIS BABY HAS SOME CHANCE OF BEING AS LOVELY AS HER MOTHER AT WHICH SPEECH FROM THE BABY'S PAPA MISSUS BIRD THOUGH SHE WAS AS WEAK AND TIRED AS SHE COULD BE BLUSHED WITH HAPPINESS AND SO CAROL CAME BY HER NAME
IT WAS STRAIGHTWAY BROKEN IN HALF AND SHARED WITH DONALD PAUL OR HUGH AND WHEN THEY MADE BELIEVE NIBBLE THE MORSEL WITH AFFECTED ENJOYMENT SHE WOULD CLAP HER HANDS AND CROW WITH DELIGHT WHY DOES SHE DO IT ASKED DONALD THOUGHTFULLY NONE OF US BOYS EVER DID
SETH TRACY'S A YOUNG IMP AND HE'D FAR SOONER BE IN MISCHIEF THAN EAT HE TRIES TO RUN ON EVERY NEW TEACHER AND HE'S RUN TWO CLEAN OUT OF THE SCHOOL BUT HE MET HIS MATCH IN MISTER WEST WILLIAM TRACY'S BOYS NOW YOU WON'T HAVE A SCRAP OF BOTHER WITH THEM
BUT IT WAS ADAM'S STRENGTH NOT ITS CORRELATIVE HARDNESS THAT INFLUENCED HIS MEDITATIONS THIS MORNING HE HAD LONG MADE UP HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE WRONG AS WELL AS FOOLISH FOR HIM TO MARRY A BLOOMING YOUNG GIRL
BY BUYING A SMALL STOCK OF SUPERIOR WOOD AND MAKING ARTICLES OF HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE FOR WHICH ADAM HAD NO END OF CONTRIVANCES SETH MIGHT GAIN MORE BY WORKING AT SEPARATE JOBS UNDER ADAM'S DIRECTION THAN BY HIS JOURNEYMAN'S WORK
ADAM ON A WORKING DAY NOTWITHSTANDING MISTER CRAIG'S PROPHECY THE DARK BLUE CLOUD DISPERSED ITSELF WITHOUT HAVING PRODUCED THE THREATENED CONSEQUENCES THE WEATHER AS HE OBSERVED THE NEXT MORNING THE WEATHER YOU SEE S A TICKLISH THING
THOUGH THEIR MERRIMENT IS OF A POOR BLUNDERING SORT NOT AT ALL LIKE THE MERRIMENT OF BIRDS AND PERHAPS THERE IS NO TIME IN A SUMMER'S DAY MORE CHEERING THAN WHEN THE WARMTH OF THE SUN IS JUST BEGINNING TO TRIUMPH OVER THE FRESHNESS OF THE MORNING
POOR LITTLE FELLOW WELL MASTER TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO A COUPLE OF ITALIAN PACK PEDDLERS CAME ALONG AND CALLED AT THE GORDON PLACE THE COUNTRY WAS SWARMING WITH THEM THEN I USETER SET THE DOG ON ONE EVERY DAY ON AN AVERAGE
OH I DARESAY THEY TORMENTED HIM A LOT ADMITTED HER HUSBAND HE'S A GREAT HAND AT THE FIDDLE AND LIKES COMPANY HE GOES TO THE HARBOUR A GOOD DEAL BUT THEY SAY HE TAKES SULKY SPELLS WHEN HE HASN'T A WORD TO THROW TO A DOG TWOULDN'T BE ANY WONDER LIVING WITH THE GORDONS
AND ADAM HAD AT PRESENT ONLY LEARNED THE ALPHABET OF IT IN HIS FATHER'S SUDDEN DEATH WHICH BY ANNIHILATING IN AN INSTANT ALL THAT HAD STIMULATED HIS INDIGNATION HAD SENT A SUDDEN RUSH OF THOUGHT AND MEMORY OVER WHAT HAD CLAIMED HIS PITY AND TENDERNESS
A TEA TABLE CONVERSATION THE WILLIAMSON PLACE WHERE ERIC BOARDED WAS ON THE CREST OF THE SUCCEEDING HILL HE LIKED IT AS WELL AS LARRY WEST HAD PROPHESIED THAT HE WOULD THE WILLIAMSONS AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE LINDSAY PEOPLE
LIKE THOSE CLUMSY BELLS ROUND THE COWS NECKS IT HAS RATHER A COARSE SOUND WHEN IT COMES CLOSE AND MAY EVEN GRATE ON YOUR EARS PAINFULLY BUT HEARD FROM FAR OFF IT MINGLES VERY PRETTILY WITH THE OTHER JOYOUS SOUNDS OF NATURE MEN'S MUSCLES MOVE BETTER WHEN THEIR SOULS ARE MAKING MERRY MUSIC
BUT MY DEAR CHILD THE TIME IS DRAWING NEAR HERE IS APRIL AND JUNE OR SAY EVEN JULY IS VERY NEAR WITH SUCH BUSINESS TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE US YOUR INEXPERIENCE REALLY AMUSES ME
THRUSTING OUT OF THE MISTS LIKE HOSTILE FISTS WAITED THE CLOSE BLOCKADE THEN DIM TO LEFT AND RIGHT THE CURVING ISLANDS WITH THEIR SHATTERED MOUNDS THAT HAD BEEN FORTS
IT WAS THORN MURDERED HALLIJOHN AND I HAD NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH IT BARBARA BROKE OUT OF THE TREES AND FLEW ALONG BUT MISTER HARE WAS ALREADY IN LOCKING AND BARRING THE DOOR LET ME IN PAPA SHE CALLED OUT
MOUNDS WHICH IN SPITE OF FOUR LONG YEARS OF RENDING AGONY STILL HELD AGAINST THE LIGHT FAINT WRAITHS OF COLOR FOR THE BREEZE TO LIFT AND FLATTEN INTO FADED RED AND WHITE THESE SUNNY ISLANDS WERE NOT MEANT FOR WARS
THERE ARE RARE NIGHTS AMONG THESE WATERWAYS WHEN SPRING FIRST TREADS THE MEADOWS OF THE MARSH LEAVING FAINT FOOTPRINTS OF ELUSIVE GREEN TO GLIMMER AS SHE STRAYS BREAKING THE WINTER SILENCE WITH THE HARSH SHARP CALL OF WATERFOWL
I ALWAYS TOLD YOU HE WOULD BE HERE AGAIN SOON DID NOT I ANNE MY DEAR DID NOT I ALWAYS TELL YOU SO AND YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME IN TOWN NEXT WEEK YOU SEE AT THE LATEST I DARE SAY FOR SHE IS AS IMPATIENT AS THE BLACK GENTLEMAN WHEN ANY THING IS TO BE DONE
I MAKE NO INQUIRY MYSELF AND SHOULD BE SORRY TO HAVE ANY MADE BY MY FRIENDS WHEN I AM QUITE DETERMINED AS TO THE TIME I AM NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF BEING LONG UNEMPLOYED THERE ARE PLACES IN TOWN OFFICES WHERE INQUIRY WOULD SOON PRODUCE SOMETHING
IF YOU KNEW THE HARP YOU MIGHT DO ALL THAT I AM VERY SURE BUT YOU SING AS WELL AS PLAY YES I REALLY BELIEVE YOU MIGHT EVEN WITHOUT THE HARP STIPULATE FOR WHAT YOU CHOSE AND YOU MUST AND SHALL BE DELIGHTFULLY HONOURABLY AND COMFORTABLY SETTLED BEFORE THE CAMPBELLS OR I HAVE ANY REST
THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT I WANTED WELL PRETTY GOOD NEWS IS NOT IT HAVE YOU FINISHED IT HAS EMMA READ IT ALL PUT IT UP PUT IT UP WE WILL HAVE A GOOD TALK ABOUT IT SOME OTHER TIME BUT IT WILL NOT DO NOW
THE TWO LADIES LOOKED OVER IT TOGETHER AND HE SAT SMILING AND TALKING TO THEM THE WHOLE TIME IN A VOICE A LITTLE SUBDUED BUT VERY AUDIBLE TO EVERY BODY WELL HE IS COMING YOU SEE GOOD NEWS I THINK WELL WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT
WHAT WAS IT THAT HAD STEPPED OUT OF THAT GROVE OF TREES AND MYSTERIOUSLY BECKONED TO HER AS SHE STOOD AT THE WINDOW TURNING HER HEART TO SICKNESS AS SHE GAZED WAS IT A HUMAN BEING ONE TO BRING MORE EVIL TO THE HOUSE WHERE SO MUCH EVIL HAD ALREADY FALLEN
I SHALL ONLY JUST MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE OTHERS IN A COMMON WAY MISSUS WESTON WAS MOST COMFORTABLY PLEASED ON THE OCCASION HER LOOKS AND WORDS HAD NOTHING TO RESTRAIN THEM
A STABLE YARD SHE UTTERED IN A DEEPLY SHOCKED TONE RICHARD DID YOU EXPECT IT WOULD BE AS A MERCHANT OR A BANKER OR PERHAPS AS SECRETARY TO ONE OF HER MAJESTY'S MINISTERS OR THAT I WAS A GENTLEMAN AT LARGE LIVING ON MY FORTUNE
RUBBING DIM SHIFTING PASTELS IN THE SCENE WITH WHITE OF MOON AND BLUR OF SCUDDING CLOUD UNTIL THE MYRTLE THICKETS AND THE SAND THE SILENT STREAMS AND THE SUBSTANTIAL LAND GO DRIFTING DOWN THE TIDE OF NIGHT ASWOON
AND THE VESSEL HULL DOWN IN THE SEA WHERE THE WATERS JUST STIRRING FROM SLEEP LIFTED BRIGHT HANDS TO THE SUN HIDING THEIR LUSTY YOUNG DEAD HOLDING THEM JEALOUSLY CLOSE DOWN TO THE COLD HARBOR FLOOR
BETHEL LIGHTLY RETURNED RICHARD HARE HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT HE WAS AFTER HIS GINS AND HIS SNARES THAT NIGHT THOUGH POACHER AS HE IS BETHEL IS NO POACHER RICHARD IS HE NOT
HER CONGRATULATIONS WERE WARM AND OPEN BUT EMMA COULD NOT SPEAK SO FLUENTLY SHE WAS A LITTLE OCCUPIED IN WEIGHING HER OWN FEELINGS AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE OF HER AGITATION WHICH SHE RATHER THOUGHT WAS CONSIDERABLE
YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF PROCURING EXACTLY THE DESIRABLE THING I NOT AWARE SAID JANE SHAKING HER HEAD DEAR MISSUS ELTON WHO CAN HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AS I HAVE DONE
AND THE SLOW MOVING BREEZE DRAWS LANGUID FINGERS DOWN THEIR PLACID BROWS EVEN THE SURLY OCEAN KNOWS THEIR CHARMS AND UNDER THE SHRILL LAUGHTER OF THE SURF HE BOOMS AND SINGS HIS HEAVY MONOTONE TWO
OF FINISHING HIS DAY IN THE EFFORTS OF CIVILITY AND THE NOISE OF NUMBERS WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO STRIKE HIM DEEPLY A MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN MOTION SINCE EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN STILL WHO HAD BEEN LONG TALKING AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN SILENT
SHOOK ITS SHOULDERS FREE AND FACED THE SEA THEN CAME AN INTERVAL THAT SEEMED TO BE PART OF ETERNITY YEARS MIGHT HAVE PASSED OR SECONDS NO ONE KNEW CLOSE IN THE DARK WE HUDDLED EACH TO EACH
HER WIDE HIGH SWEEP OF SPARS FLAUNTING THEIR ARROGANCE AMONG THE STARS DARKNESS AGAIN SWIFT WINGED AND ABSOLUTE GULPING THE STARS FOLDING THE SHIPS AND SEA HOLDING US WAITING MUTE
THE POST OFFICE CATCHING COLD FETCHING LETTERS AND FRIENDSHIP WERE LONG UNDER DISCUSSION AND TO THEM SUCCEEDED ONE WHICH MUST BE AT LEAST EQUALLY UNPLEASANT TO JANE INQUIRIES WHETHER SHE HAD YET HEARD OF ANY SITUATION LIKELY TO SUIT HER
ELIZA COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT REMEMBER AND SHE PERSISTED IN CALLING YOUR ROOM MISTER RICHARD'S I THINK THE WOMAN DID IT HEEDLESSLY NOT MALICIOUSLY TO PROVOKE PAPA SHE WAS A GOOD SERVANT AND HAD BEEN WITH US THREE YEARS YOU KNOW
AYE THAT MAY SUIT YOUR HUMBLE IDEAS OF YOURSELF I KNOW WHAT A MODEST CREATURE YOU ARE BUT IT WILL NOT SATISFY YOUR FRIENDS TO HAVE YOU TAKING UP WITH ANY THING THAT MAY OFFER ANY INFERIOR COMMONPLACE SITUATION
REJOINED RICHARD HARE SIGNIFICANTLY THE TRUTH AS TO WHAT HE IS MAY COME OUT SOME TIME NOT THAT I WISH IT TO COME OUT THE MAN HAS DONE NO HARM TO ME AND HE MAY GO ON POACHING WITH IMPUNITY TILL DOOMSDAY FOR ALL I CARE HE AND LOCKSLEY
RICHARD INTERRUPTED HIS SISTER IN A HUSHED VOICE MAMMA ENTERTAINS ONE FIXED IDEA WHICH SHE CANNOT PUT FROM HER SHE IS CERTAIN THAT BETHEL HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER THEN SHE IS WRONG WHY SHOULD SHE THINK SO
THE FIRST TIME SHE TRANSGRESSED PAPA WARNED HER THE SECOND HE THUNDERED AT HER AS I BELIEVE NOBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD CAN THUNDER AND THE THIRD HE TURNED HER FROM THE DOORS NEVER ALLOWING HER TO GET HER BONNET
OH WHAT A MISERABLE NIGHT'S WORK THAT WAS OUR ONLY COMFORT IS RICHARD THAT YOU MUST HAVE COMMITTED THE DEED IN MADNESS I DID NOT COMMIT IT AT ALL HE REPLIED WHAT SHE EXCLAIMED
WHEN THE LADIES RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER EMMA FOUND IT HARDLY POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THEIR MAKING TWO DISTINCT PARTIES WITH SO MUCH PERSEVERANCE IN JUDGING AND BEHAVING ILL DID MISSUS ELTON ENGROSS JANE FAIRFAX AND SLIGHT HERSELF
I WAS NOT EVEN AT THE COTTAGE AT THE TIME I SWEAR IT TO YOU THE MAN WHO DID THE DEED WAS THORN THORN ECHOED BARBARA LIFTING HER HEAD WHO IS THORN I DON'T KNOW WHO
COLD AND STILL LOOKED THE OLD HOUSE IN THE MOONBEAMS NEVER WAS THE MOON BRIGHTER IT LIGHTED THE FAR STRETCHING GARDEN IT ILLUMINATED EVEN THE WEATHERCOCK ALOFT IT SHONE UPON THE PORTICO AND UPON ONE WHO APPEARED IN IT
I DID NOT MEAN I WAS NOT THINKING OF THE SLAVE TRADE REPLIED JANE GOVERNESS TRADE I ASSURE YOU WAS ALL THAT I HAD IN VIEW WIDELY DIFFERENT CERTAINLY AS TO THE GUILT OF THOSE WHO CARRY IT ON
IF MY HEALTH WAS DELICATE CAUSING MY POOR MOTHER TO INDULGE ME OUGHT THAT TO HAVE BEEN A REASON FOR HIS RIDICULING ME ON EVERY POSSIBLE OCCASION PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HAD MY HOME BEEN MADE HAPPIER I SHOULD NOT HAVE SOUGHT THE SOCIETY I DID ELSEWHERE
YOU MAY WELL CLASS THE DELIGHT THE HONOUR AND THE COMFORT OF SUCH A SITUATION TOGETHER SAID JANE THEY ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE EQUAL HOWEVER I AM VERY SERIOUS IN NOT WISHING ANY THING TO BE ATTEMPTED AT PRESENT FOR ME
IN A FAMILY NOT MOVING IN A CERTAIN CIRCLE OR ABLE TO COMMAND THE ELEGANCIES OF LIFE YOU ARE VERY OBLIGING BUT AS TO ALL THAT I AM VERY INDIFFERENT IT WOULD BE NO OBJECT TO ME TO BE WITH THE RICH MY MORTIFICATIONS I THINK WOULD ONLY BE THE GREATER
THREE A SUDDEN FLOOD OF MOONLIGHT DRENCHED THE SEA POINTING THE SCENE IN SHARP STRONG BLACK AND WHITE SUMTER CAME SHOULDERING THROUGH THE NIGHT BATTERED AND GRIM
THEN FLAME ON FLAME THE CARDINALS CAME BLOWING LIKE DRIVEN BRANDS UP FROM THE SULTRY LANDS WHERE SUMMER'S HAPPY FIRES ALWAYS BURN OLD SILENCES THAT PAIN HAD HELD TOO CLOSE AND LONG STIRRED TO THE MOCKER'S SONG
AND SOON MOVED AWAY TO MAKE THE REST OF HIS FRIENDS HAPPY BY A PARTIAL COMMUNICATION OF WHAT THE WHOLE ROOM MUST HAVE OVERHEARD ALREADY IT WAS WELL THAT HE TOOK EVERY BODY'S JOY FOR GRANTED OR HE MIGHT NOT HAVE THOUGHT EITHER MISTER WOODHOUSE OR MISTER KNIGHTLEY PARTICULARLY DELIGHTED
AND HOPE LOOKED OUT AGAIN FROM TIRED EYES DOWN WHERE THE WHITE POINT GARDENS DRANK THE SUN AND RIPPLED TO THE LIFT OF SPRINGING GRASS THE WOMEN CAME AND AFTER THEM THE AGED AND THE LAME THAT WAR HAD HURLED BACK AT THEM LIKE A TAUNT
THEN DOWN BENEATH OUR FEET WE CAUGHT THE GLEAM OF FOLDED WATER FLARING LEFT AND RIGHT WHILE WITH A NOISELESS RUSH A SHADOW DARKER THAN THE REST DREW FROM ITS FELLOWS SWARMING ROUND THE QUAY TOOK AN ONCOMING BREAKER
I HAVE SOME NOTION OF PUTTING SUCH A TRIMMING AS THIS TO MY WHITE AND SILVER POPLIN DO YOU THINK IT WILL LOOK WELL THE WHOLE PARTY WERE BUT JUST REASSEMBLED IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHEN MISTER WESTON MADE HIS APPEARANCE AMONG THEM
BUT EYES WENT HOMING SWIFTLY TO THE WEST WHERE FAINT AND VERY FEW THE WINDOWS OF THE TOWN CALLED OUT TO THEM YET HELD THEM NERVED AND READY FOR THE TEST YOUNG EVERY ONE THEY BROUGHT LIFE AT ITS BEST
READ IT READ IT SAID HE IT WILL GIVE YOU PLEASURE ONLY A FEW LINES WILL NOT TAKE YOU LONG READ IT TO EMMA
BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT IS NOT OVER TRIMMED I HAVE THE GREATEST DISLIKE TO THE IDEA OF BEING OVER TRIMMED QUITE A HORROR OF FINERY I MUST PUT ON A FEW ORNAMENTS NOW BECAUSE IT IS EXPECTED OF ME A BRIDE YOU KNOW MUST APPEAR LIKE A BRIDE
IS MY FATHER AS BITTER AGAINST ME AS EVER QUITE HE NEVER MENTIONS YOUR NAME OR SUFFERS IT TO BE MENTIONED
SEE HOW THEY CURVE AWAY BEFORE THE BAY BIDDING THE VOYAGER PAUSE WARM WITH THE HOARDED SUNS OF CENTURIES YOUNG WITH THE GARNERED YOUTH OF MANY SPRINGS THEY LAUGH LIKE HAPPY BATHERS WHILE THE SEAS BREAK IN THEIR OPEN ARMS
GILDING OLD RUINS WITH HER JASMINE SPRAY DISTILLING WARM MOIST PERFUME FROM CHILL WINTER SHADE OUT OF THE SOUTH SHE BROUGHT THE WHISPERINGS OF QUESTING WINGS
WHO HAD BEEN IN MORE THAN ONE CROWD AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALONE SUCH A MAN TO QUIT THE TRANQUILLITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS OWN FIRESIDE AND ON THE EVENING OF A COLD SLEETY APRIL DAY RUSH OUT AGAIN INTO THE WORLD
THE SOB AND GASP OF BREATH AGAINST AN AIR EMPTY AND DAMP AND FETID AS A TOMB WITH THEM I SEEMED TO REEL BENEATH THE SPIN AND HEEL WHEN COMBERS TOOK THEM FAIR
ON SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS I SAW THE LAST CREW GO OUT OF A WORLD TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LEAVE ONLY A CHOSEN FEW BESIDE THE CREW WERE GATHERED ON THE PIER
BARBARA I MUST BE ALLOWED AN INTERVIEW WITH MY MOTHER BARBARA HARE REFLECTED BEFORE SHE SPOKE I DO NOT SEE HOW IT CAN BE MANAGED WHY CAN'T SHE COME OUT TO ME AS YOU HAVE DONE IS SHE UP OR IN BED
AND IN THE EBB AND FLOW OF DARK AND MOON WE SAW THEM FARE STRAIGHT PAST THE ROW OF COFFINS WHERE THE FIFTH CREW LAY WAITING THEIR LAST SHORT VOYAGE ACROSS THE BAY AND AS THEY WENT NOT ONE AMONG THEM SWERVED
IN SPITE OF HIS SMOCK FROCK AND HIS STRAW WISPED HAT AND HIS FALSE WHISKERS BLACK AS EREBUS SHE KNEW HIM FOR HER BROTHER OH RICHARD WHERE HAVE YOU COME FROM WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE DID YOU KNOW ME BARBARA WAS HIS REJOINDER
MISTER WESTON HOWEVER TOO EAGER TO BE VERY OBSERVANT TOO COMMUNICATIVE TO WANT OTHERS TO TALK WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH WHAT SHE DID SAY
ONE OF THE OTHERS CARRYING HER BONNET AND SHAWL TO THE GATE AND HER BOXES WERE SENT AWAY THE SAME DAY PAPA TOOK AN OATH DID YOU HEAR OF IT WHAT OATH HE TAKES MANY THIS WAS A SOLEMN ONE RICHARD
AND THE FACES THAT WAITED AND WATCHED BLURRED INTO A WAVERING LINE LIKE FOAM ON THE CURVE OF THE DARK DOWN THERE BY THE RETICENT SEA WHAT IF THE DARKNESS SHOULD BRING THE LEAN BLOCKADE RUNNERS ACROSS WITH FOOD FOR THE HUNGRY AND SPENT
IN THIS STYLE SHE RAN ON NEVER THOROUGHLY STOPPED BY ANY THING TILL MISTER WOODHOUSE CAME INTO THE ROOM HER VANITY HAD THEN A CHANGE OF OBJECT AND EMMA HEARD HER SAYING IN THE SAME HALF WHISPER TO JANE
A SHIP OF LIGHT OUT OF A MOLTEN SEA HANG AN UNENDING PULSE BEAT GLOWING STARK WHILE THE HOT CLOUDS FLUNG BACK A SULLEN ROAR THEN ALL HER PRIDE SO CONFIDENT AND SURE WENT REELING DOWN THE DARK
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK OF IT TO NIGHT RETURNED BARBARA IN AN ALARMED TONE
BUT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AS I HAVE YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY CANDIDATES THERE ALWAYS ARE FOR THE FIRST SITUATIONS I SAW A VAST DEAL OF THAT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ROUND MAPLE GROVE A COUSIN OF MISTER SUCKLING MISSUS BRAGGE
HERE COMES THIS DEAR OLD BEAU OF MINE I PROTEST ONLY THINK OF HIS GALLANTRY IN COMING AWAY BEFORE THE OTHER MEN WHAT A DEAR CREATURE HE IS I ASSURE YOU I LIKE HIM EXCESSIVELY
THE CURVE OF SHIPS SHOOK OFF THEIR DIM VAGUE OUTLINES OF A DREAM AND STOOD PATIENT AS DEATH SO CERTAIN IN THEIR PRIDE SO SATISFIED TO WAIT THE SLOW INEVITABLENESS OF FATE CLOSE WHERE THE CHANNEL NARROWED TO THE BAY
I SHOULD SUFFER MORE FROM COMPARISON A GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY IS ALL THAT I SHOULD CONDITION FOR I KNOW YOU I KNOW YOU YOU WOULD TAKE UP WITH ANY THING BUT I SHALL BE A LITTLE MORE NICE AND I AM SURE THE GOOD CAMPBELLS WILL BE QUITE ON MY SIDE
THAT WAS GOODBYE AND GODSPEED I KNOW HE IS THERE WITH THE REST BRAVE BUT WITH QUIVERING LIPS EACH ALONE IN THE PRESS OF THE CROWD WAS SAYING IT OVER AND OVER
WHICH THOUGH PRINCIPALLY ADDRESSED TO MISSUS WESTON HE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST DOUBT OF BEING HIGHLY INTERESTING TO EVERY BODY IN THE ROOM HE GAVE HER A LETTER IT WAS FROM FRANK AND TO HERSELF HE HAD MET WITH IT IN HIS WAY AND HAD TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF OPENING IT
WELL RETURNED RICHARD IT WAS NOT TO DISCUSS THESE THINGS THAT I PUT MYSELF IN JEOPARDY AND TO ASSERT MY INNOCENCE CAN DO NO GOOD IT CANNOT SET ASIDE THE CORONER'S VERDICT OF WILFUL MURDER AGAINST RICHARD HARE THE YOUNGER
TRAILING ITS PALLOR LIKE A WINDING SHEET OVER THE LAST CREW AND ITS CHOSEN GRAVE
THE MONEY NO DOUBT CAN BE YOURS BUT I AM NOT SO SURE ABOUT YOUR SEEING MAMMA I AM TERRIFIED FOR YOUR SAFETY BUT IF IT IS AS YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE INNOCENT SHE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE COULD IT NOT BE PROVED
IF ANY ONE CAN HELP YOU OR TAKE MEASURES TO ESTABLISH YOUR INNOCENCE HE CAN AND YOU KNOW THAT HE IS TRUE AS STEEL THERE'S NO OTHER MAN LIVING SHOULD BE TRUSTED WITH THE SECRET THAT I AM HERE EXCEPT CARLYLE WHERE IS IT THEY SUPPOSE THAT I AM BARBARA
OFFICES FOR THE SALE NOT QUITE OF HUMAN FLESH BUT OF HUMAN INTELLECT OH MY DEAR HUMAN FLESH YOU QUITE SHOCK ME IF YOU MEAN A FLING AT THE SLAVE TRADE I ASSURE YOU MISTER SUCKLING WAS ALWAYS RATHER A FRIEND TO THE ABOLITION
WAS MAKING HIMSELF AGREEABLE AMONG THE REST AND HAVING SATISFIED THE INQUIRIES OF HIS WIFE AS TO HIS DINNER CONVINCING HER THAT NONE OF ALL HER CAREFUL DIRECTIONS TO THE SERVANTS HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN AND SPREAD ABROAD WHAT PUBLIC NEWS HE HAD HEARD WAS PROCEEDING TO A FAMILY COMMUNICATION
MOST LIKELY THEY WILL BE THERE TO MORROW OR SATURDAY AS TO HER ILLNESS ALL NOTHING OF COURSE BUT IT IS AN EXCELLENT THING TO HAVE FRANK AMONG US AGAIN SO NEAR AS TOWN THEY WILL STAY A GOOD WHILE WHEN THEY DO COME AND HE WILL BE HALF HIS TIME WITH US
GAZED AT BARBARA HALLOO WHAT BRINGS YOU OUT AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT YOUNG LADY I WENT DOWN TO THE GATE TO LOOK FOR YOU SHE PANTED AND HAD HAD STROLLED OVER TO THE SIDE PATH DID YOU NOT SEE ME
SHOULD MAMMA SEE YOU IT WILL KILL HER OUTRIGHT I CAN'T LIVE ON AS I AM LIVING HE ANSWERED GLOOMILY I HAVE BEEN WORKING IN LONDON EVER SINCE IN LONDON INTERRUPTED BARBARA IN LONDON AND HAVE NEVER STIRRED OUT OF IT
BUT AS TO THE GREATER MISERY OF THE VICTIMS I DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT LIES BUT I ONLY MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE ARE ADVERTISING OFFICES AND THAT BY APPLYING TO THEM I SHOULD HAVE NO DOUBT OF VERY SOON MEETING WITH SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD DO REPEATED MISSUS ELTON
OUT OF THE BLACKNESS WAVE ON LIVID WAVE LEAPT INTO BEING THUNDERED TO OUR FEET COUNTING THE MOMENTS FOR US BEAT BY BEAT UNTIL THE LAST AND SMALLEST DWINDLED PAST
THEN DROPPED OUT SOFTLY LIKE A DREAM INTO THE ROCKING SHADOWS OF THE STREAM A SUDDEN GRIND OF METAL SCARRED THE HUSH A MARSH HEN THRESHED THE WATER WITH HER WINGS AND FOR A BREATH THE MARSH LIFE WOKE AND THROBBED
RETORTED RICHARD HARE IN A TONE OF CHAFED ANGUISH PAINFUL TO HEAR I GET TWELVE SHILLINGS A WEEK AND THAT HAS TO FIND ME IN EVERYTHING POOR RICHARD POOR RICHARD SHE WAILED CARESSING HIS HAND AND WEEPING OVER IT
EACH HUDDLED DUMBLY TO EACH BUT EYES COULD NOT LIFT FROM THE SEA ONLY HANDS TOUCHED IN THE DAWN HE WOULD HAVE GONE MY MAN HE WAS LIKE THAT IN THE NIGHT WHEN I AWOKE WITH A START AND BROUGHT HIS VOICE UP FROM MY DREAM
I AM EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED TO YOU MISSUS ELTON I AM OBLIGED TO ANY BODY WHO FEELS FOR ME BUT I AM QUITE SERIOUS IN WISHING NOTHING TO BE DONE TILL THE SUMMER FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS LONGER I SHALL REMAIN WHERE I AM AND AS I AM
MISTER HARE CLOSED THE GATE AND WALKED ON UP THE PATH I MUST GO RICHARD SAID BARBARA HASTILY I DARE NOT STAY ANOTHER MINUTE BE HERE AGAIN TO MORROW NIGHT AND MEANWHILE I WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
AND PROFESSIONS OF MISSUS ELTON'S MEDITATED ACTIVITY HERE IS APRIL COME SAID SHE I GET QUITE ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU JUNE WILL SOON BE HERE BUT I HAVE NEVER FIXED ON JUNE OR ANY OTHER MONTH
THE DAY FLOODED ALL OF THE SKY AND THE SHIPS OF THE SULLEN BLOCKADE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND DREW DOWN THE WIND LEAVING THEIR WRECK TO THE WAVES HOUR HEAVED SLOWLY ON HOUR
SOME THAT YOU ARE IN AUSTRALIA THE VERY UNCERTAINTY HAS NEARLY KILLED MAMMA
IT IS HARD TO HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM HER FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND TO GO BACK WITHOUT SEEING HER RETURNED RICHARD AND ABOUT THE MONEY IT IS A HUNDRED POUNDS THAT I WANT YOU MUST BE HERE AGAIN TO MORROW NIGHT RICHARD
A SITUATION SUCH AS YOU DESERVE AND YOUR FRIENDS WOULD REQUIRE FOR YOU IS NO EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE IS NOT OBTAINED AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE INDEED INDEED WE MUST BEGIN INQUIRING DIRECTLY EXCUSE ME MA'AM BUT THIS IS BY NO MEANS MY INTENTION
WAS IT A SUPERNATURAL VISITANT OR WAS IT BUT A DELUSION OF HER OWN EYESIGHT NOT THE LATTER CERTAINLY FOR THE FIGURE WAS NOW EMERGING AGAIN MOTIONING TO HER AS BEFORE
BUT YOU REMEMBER HOW WEAK AND FANCIFUL SHE IS AND SINCE THAT DREADFUL NIGHT SHE IS ALWAYS HAVING WHAT SHE CALLS DREAMS' MEANING THAT SHE DREAMS OF THE MURDER IN ALL THESE DREAMS BETHEL IS PROMINENT
AND SHE SAYS SHE FEELS AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT HE WAS IN SOME WAY OR OTHER MIXED UP IN IT BARBARA HE WAS NO MORE MIXED UP IN IT THAN YOU AND YOU SAY THAT YOU WERE NOT
AND A CRY ESCAPED HER TELLING MORE OF SORROW THAN OF JOY THOUGH BETRAYING BOTH SHE PENETRATED THE TREES AND BURST INTO TEARS AS ONE IN THE DRESS OF A FARM LABORER CAUGHT HER IN HIS ARMS
AND WAITING THERE I SEEMED TO FEEL THE BEACH SLIP FROM MY REACH WHILE ALL THE STARS WENT BLANK THE SMELL OF OIL AND DEATH ENVELOPED ME AND I COULD FEEL THE CROUCHING FIGURES STRAINING AT A CRANK KNEES UNDER CHINS
YOU KNOW HIS DISPOSITION RICHARD AND THEREFORE MAY BE SURE HE WILL KEEP IT INDEED IT IS MOST DANGEROUS FOR YOU TO BE HERE I KNOW THAT HE NEVER TREATED ME AS HE OUGHT CRIED RICHARD BITTERLY
THEY WERE THE FIRST ENTITLED AFTER MISSUS WESTON AND EMMA TO BE MADE HAPPY FROM THEM HE WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED TO MISS FAIRFAX BUT SHE WAS SO DEEP IN CONVERSATION WITH JOHN KNIGHTLEY THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO POSITIVE AN INTERRUPTION
COLONEL AND MISSUS CAMPBELL ARE TO BE IN TOWN AGAIN BY MIDSUMMER SAID JANE I MUST SPEND SOME TIME WITH THEM I AM SURE THEY WILL WANT IT AFTERWARDS I MAY PROBABLY BE GLAD TO DISPOSE OF MYSELF BUT I WOULD NOT WISH YOU TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF MAKING ANY INQUIRIES AT PRESENT
BUT MY NATURAL TASTE IS ALL FOR SIMPLICITY A SIMPLE STYLE OF DRESS IS SO INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO FINERY BUT I AM QUITE IN THE MINORITY I BELIEVE FEW PEOPLE SEEM TO VALUE SIMPLICITY OF DRESS SHOW AND FINERY ARE EVERY THING
BESIDES A MAN THAT THE POLICE RUNNERS WERE AFTER COULD BE MORE SAFE IN OBSCURITY CONSIDERING THAT HE WAS A GENTLEMAN THAN BARBARA TURNED SUDDENLY AND PLACED HER HAND UPON HER BROTHER'S MOUTH BE SILENT FOR YOUR LIFE SHE WHISPERED HERE'S PAPA
YET HOW COULD THE CITY REJOICE WITH THE WOMEN OUT THERE BY THE WALL NIGHT GREW UNDER THE WHARVES AND CREPT THROUGH THE LISTENING STREETS UNTIL ONLY THE RED OF THE TILES SEEMED WARM FROM THE BREATH OF THE DAY
THE GUESSING AT IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME AND MY GUESS IS AS SURE AND TRUE A ONE AS THAT THE MOON IS IN THE HEAVENS BARBARA SHIVERED AS SHE DREW CLOSE TO HIM IT WAS A SHIVERING SUBJECT YOU SURELY DO NOT MEAN TO THROW THE GUILT ON BETHEL
TOO STIRRED FOR SPEECH OUR SENSES SHARPENED TO AN AGONY DREW OUT ACROSS THE WATER TILL THE ACHE WAS MORE THAN WE COULD BEAR TILL EYES COULD ALMOST SEE EARS ALMOST HEAR
AFTER THE DELIVERY OF THE VERDICT HE TOOK AN OATH IN THE JUSTICE ROOM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS BROTHER MAGISTRATES THAT IF HE COULD FIND YOU HE WOULD DELIVER YOU UP TO JUSTICE AND THAT HE WOULD DO IT THOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT TURN UP FOR TEN YEARS TO COME
SHE WAS SPEEDING AWAY BUT RICHARD HELD HER BACK YOU DID NOT SEEM TO BELIEVE MY ASSERTION OF INNOCENCE BARBARA WE ARE HERE ALONE IN THE STILL NIGHT WITH GOD ABOVE US AS TRULY AS THAT YOU AND I MUST SOMETIME MEET HIM FACE TO FACE I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH
VOICES WERE HEARD APPROACHING THE GATE THOSE OF JUSTICE HARE AND SQUIRE PINNER THE LATTER WALKED ON THE FORMER CAME IN THE BROTHER AND SISTER COWERED TOGETHER SCARCELY DARING TO BREATHE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD BARBARA'S HEART BEATING
IN THE TAUT STILLNESS NOT A WORD WAS UTTERED BUT ONE HEARD THE DEEP SLOW ORCHESTRATION OF THE NIGHT SWELL AND RELAPSE AS SWIFTLY ONE BY ONE CUTTING A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE GRAY THEY ROSE
ARE YOU AND I MYTHS RETORTED RICHARD SO EVEN YOU DOUBT ME RICHARD SHE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED WHY NOT TELL THE WHOLE CIRCUMSTANCES TO ARCHIBALD CARLYLE
BARBARA I SWEAR THAT I AM INNOCENT I SWEAR I WAS NOT PRESENT WHEN THE MAN WAS MURDERED I SWEAR THAT FROM MY OWN POSITIVE KNOWLEDGE MY EYESIGHT I KNOW NO MORE WHO DID IT THAN YOU
JOHN KNIGHTLEY ONLY WAS IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT THAT A MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE SPENT HIS EVENING QUIETLY AT HOME AFTER A DAY OF BUSINESS IN LONDON SHOULD SET OFF AGAIN AND WALK HALF A MILE TO ANOTHER MAN'S HOUSE FOR THE SAKE OF BEING IN MIXED COMPANY TILL BED TIME
COULD HE BY A TOUCH OF HIS FINGER HAVE INSTANTLY TAKEN BACK HIS WIFE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MOTIVE BUT HIS COMING WOULD PROBABLY PROLONG RATHER THAN BREAK UP THE PARTY JOHN KNIGHTLEY LOOKED AT HIM WITH AMAZEMENT THEN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID
MISSUS ELTON LEFT THEM NO CHOICE IF JANE REPRESSED HER FOR A LITTLE TIME SHE SOON BEGAN AGAIN AND THOUGH MUCH THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM WAS IN A HALF WHISPER ESPECIALLY ON MISSUS ELTON'S SIDE THERE WAS NO AVOIDING A KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS
