AND I KNOW SOMEBODY ELSE THAT SAID SO TOO WHO WAS IT THERE WAS NO ANSWER WHO WAS IT DEMANDED POLLYANNA MORE PEREMPTORILY DAD
ONLY EMPHASIZED THE PITIFUL MOTIONLESSNESS OF THE ONCE ACTIVE LITTLE FEET AND LEGS NOW LYING SO WOEFULLY QUIET UNDER THE BLANKETS AS TO THE GAME POLLYANNA TOLD NANCY THESE DAYS HOW GLAD SHE WAS GOING TO BE
AND HIS WIFE HAD A BABY HERE BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WEDDING BEFORE IT DOES SEEM SO STRANGE TO THINK OF ANNE BEING MARRIED IN A WAY SHE JUST SEEMS TO ME THE LITTLE GIRL MATTHEW BROUGHT HOME HERE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO
SO GILBERT DIDN'T GO BACK ON YOU AFTER ALL SAID MISSUS HARMON ANDREWS CONTRIVING TO CONVEY AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE IN HER TONE
THAT HAD TO DEAL WITH BIG FEARSOME SOUNDING WORDS BESIDES IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE WOULD NOT MISTER PENDLETON BE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN MISSUS CAREW'S TAKING THE BOY INTO HER HOME
HE WAS RICH TO BE SURE AND GILBERT IS POOR AT LEAST TO BEGIN WITH BUT THEN HE'S AN ISLAND BOY HE'S GILBERT BLYTHE SAID MARILLA CONTENTEDLY MARILLA WOULD HAVE DIED THE DEATH BEFORE SHE WOULD HAVE
IF YOU KNEW HALF AS MUCH AS HE DOES YOU'D KNOW THAT TOO SHE FINISHED WITH FLASHING EYES JIMMY PENDLETON FLUSHED MISERABLY AND LOOKED UTTERLY WRETCHED
OH NO DEAR IT WASN'T DOCTOR CHILTON AT ALL THAT I MEANT IT IS A NEW DOCTOR A VERY FAMOUS DOCTOR FROM NEW YORK WHO WHO KNOWS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ABOUT HURTS LIKE YOURS
THAT SHE WOULD DO ANYTHING ANYTHING BUT THAT TO PLEASE HER DEAR POLLYANNA AS THE DAYS OF WAITING PASSED ONE BY ONE IT DID INDEED SEEM THAT AUNT POLLY WAS DOING EVERYTHING BUT THAT
AND RETURNED INNUMERABLE CHEERY ANSWERS TO THE MANY MESSAGES OF LOVE AND INQUIRY THAT WERE BROUGHT TO HER BEDSIDE BUT SHE TOO GREW PALE AND THIN AND THE NERVOUS ACTIVITY OF THE POOR LITTLE HANDS AND ARMS
IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS PRAYED FOR SAID MISSUS RACHEL IN THE TONE OF ONE WHO IS COMFORTABLY SURE THAT HER PRAYERS HAVE AVAILED MUCH IT WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO FIND OUT THAT SHE REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE THE KINGSPORT MAN
I'M NOT JIMMY BEAN I'M JIMMY PENDLETON AND I MEAN THAT I SHOULD THINK FROM YOUR TALK THAT THERE WASN'T ANYBODY DOWN TO BOSTON BUT JUST THAT LOONY BOY WHO CALLS THEM BIRDS AND SQUIRRELS LADY LANCELOT
THAT SHE WAS GROWING THIN AND PALE AS TO POLLYANNA POLLYANNA PETTED THE DOG SMOOTHED THE CAT'S SLEEK HEAD ADMIRED THE FLOWERS AND ATE THE FRUITS AND JELLIES THAT WERE SENT IN TO HER
AN MISS POLLYANNA LOOKIN ON AN BOSSIN FROM THE BED
POLLYANNA'S FACE FELL I DON'T BELIEVE HE KNOWS HALF SO MUCH AS DOCTOR CHILTON OH YES HE DOES I'M SURE DEAR BUT IT WAS DOCTOR CHILTON WHO DOCTORED MISTER PENDLETON'S BROKEN LEG AUNT POLLY
SO THAT THE RICH PEOPLE COULD GIVE THE POOR PEOPLE PART OF THEIR MONEY BUT AGAIN MISTER PENDLETON INTERRUPTED WITH A LAUGH OH POLLYANNA POLLYANNA HE CHUCKLED I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GETTING INTO PRETTY DEEP WATER
THIS TIME BELDINGSVILLE DID NOT LITERALLY WELCOME POLLYANNA HOME WITH BRASS BANDS AND BUNTING PERHAPS BECAUSE THE HOUR OF HER EXPECTED ARRIVAL WAS KNOWN TO BUT FEW OF THE TOWNSPEOPLE
AND MILES OF PICTURES AND STATUES AND STORE WINDOWS AND STREETS THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY END AND FOLKS I NEVER SAW SUCH A LOT OF FOLKS WELL I'M SURE
THERE AIN'T NO SPECIAL DIFF'RENCE AS I CAN SEE OR ANYBODY I GUESS SHE JEST LAYS THERE AN SLEEPS AN TALKS SOME AN TRIES TER SMILE AN BE GLAD CAUSE THE SUN SETS OR THE MOON RISES OR SOME OTHER SUCH THING
THAT SHE COULD DO TO PLEASE HER NIECE I WOULDN'T A BELIEVED IT YOU COULDN'T A MADE ME BELIEVE IT NANCY SAID TO OLD TOM ONE MORNING
RED HAIR IS VERY FASHIONABLE NOW SAID ANNE TRYING TO SMILE BUT SPEAKING RATHER COLDLY LIFE HAD DEVELOPED IN HER A SENSE OF HUMOR WHICH HELPED HER OVER MANY DIFFICULTIES
I'M GOING TO GIVE ANNE TWO OF MY COTTON WARP SPREADS SHE RESUMED A TOBACCO STRIPE ONE AND AN APPLE LEAF ONE SHE TELLS ME THEY'RE GETTING TO BE REAL FASHIONABLE AGAIN
HE IS A VERY NICE BOY AND HE KNOWS A LOT BOOKS AND STORIES WHY HE CAN MAKE STORIES RIGHT OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD BESIDES IT ISN'T LADY LANCELOT IT'S SIR LANCELOT
NANCY SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS OH SHE AIN'T HANDSOME OF COURSE BUT I WILL OWN UP SHE DON'T LOOK LIKE THE SAME WOMAN WHAT WITH THE RIBBONS AN LACE JIGGERS MISS POLLYANNA MAKES HER WEAR ROUND HER NECK
SHE LOOKS LIKE FOLKS NOW SHE'S ACTUALLY ALMOST KEERFUL NOW NANCY INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN WITH A SLOW GRIN
SHE BELONGED TO THE TYPE WHICH ALWAYS HAS A STRINGY BLACK FEATHER IN ITS HAT AND STRAGGLING LOCKS OF HAIR ON ITS NECK ANNE'S SURFACE PLEASURE IN HER PRETTY BRIDAL THINGS WAS TEMPORARILY SHADOWED
LIKE EATING DINNER AT NIGHT INSTEAD OF NOONS WHEN YOU OUGHT TO EAT IT BUT EVERYBODY WAS SO GOOD TO ME AND I SAW SUCH A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS BUNKER HILL AND THE PUBLIC GARDEN AND THE SEEING BOSTON AUTOS
IT WAS WELL BUILT TO BEGIN WITH I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS SOME ROMANTIC STORY CONNECTED WITH ITS BUILDING BUT THE MAN I RENTED IT FROM DIDN'T KNOW IT HE SAID CAPTAIN JIM WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD SPIN THAT OLD YARN NOW WHO IS CAPTAIN JIM
THAT WOULD BE EXPECTING TOO MUCH BUT THERE IS A BROOK AND IT ACTUALLY CUTS ACROSS ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN THEN SAID ANNE WITH A LONG SIGH OF SUPREME SATISFACTION
AT THE LAST MOMENT A TELEGRAM TOLD OF AN UNAVOIDABLE DELAY OWING TO THE SUDDEN ILLNESS OF THE SPECIALIST HIMSELF
I'D LIKE TO BE ONE I DON'T DOUBT IT POLLYANNA SMILED THE MAN BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SCHEME OF YOURS FOR THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM ON YOUR HANDS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH
BUT THE HOUSE ITSELF GILBERT OUR FIRST HOME WHAT IS IT LIKE NOT VERY LARGE BUT LARGE ENOUGH FOR US THERE'S A SPLENDID LIVING ROOM WITH A FIREPLACE IN IT DOWNSTAIRS AND A DINING ROOM THAT LOOKS OUT ON THE HARBOR
WELL I GUESS YE WON'T THEN FROM ME OH MISTER TOM COME ON NOW WHEEDLED THE GIRL YE SEE THERE AIN'T MANY FOLKS HERE THAT I CAN ASK MAYBE NOT BUT THERE'S ONE ANYHOW THAT AIN'T ANSWERIN
SHE WA'N'T THERE AND ALWAYS EVERYWHERE SHE WENT POLLYANNA MET THE QUESTION WELL HOW DID YOU LIKE BOSTON PERHAPS TO NO ONE DID SHE ANSWER THIS MORE FULLY THAN SHE DID TO MISTER PENDLETON
AS HE TURNED LOFTILY AWAY LEAVING A DISTRESSED BEWILDERED POLLYANNA BEHIND HIM WELL ANYWAY I CAN BE GLAD HE DOESN'T ALWAYS ACT LIKE THIS SIGHED THE LITTLE GIRL
PUT INTO WORDS THE THOUGHT THAT WAS ALWAYS IN THE BACKGROUND OF HER MIND WHENEVER SHE HAD LOOKED AT GILBERT FROM HIS CHILDHOOD UP THE THOUGHT THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HER OWN WILFUL PRIDE LONG LONG AGO HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HER SON
THE NAME JAMIE THAT WAS DUBBED SISSY THE BOY SIGHED WE JUST WENT ON TILL WE FOUND ANOTHER PLACE AND TWAS THERE DAD DIED
IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT JIMMY SAID MUCH OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PAST LIFE OF HIS BEFORE SHE HAD KNOWN HIM AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SHE PROMPTED POLLYANNA HAD FOR THE MOMENT FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT OF THE CONTROVERSY
SURRENDERED AND LAUGHED WITH HIM WELL ANYWAY SHE REITERATED WHEN SHE HAD CAUGHT HER BREATH I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ALL THE SAME NO DEAR I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T AGREED THE MAN
BUT WHEN WE GET A PHONE IN THAT WON'T MATTER SO MUCH THE SITUATION IS BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKS TO THE SUNSET AND HAS THE GREAT BLUE HARBOR BEFORE IT THE SAND DUNES AREN'T VERY FAR AWAY THE SEA WINDS BLOW OVER THEM AND THE SEA SPRAY DRENCHES THEM
GLEN SAINT MARY FOLKS PREFER PLUSH BROCADE AND SIDEBOARDS WITH MIRRORS AND ORNAMENTATIONS I FANCY BUT MISS RUSSELL'S FURNITURE IS VERY GOOD AND I FEEL SURE YOU'LL LIKE IT ANNE SO FAR GOOD SAID ANNE
IN STARTING ON A ROUND OF FLY AWAY MINUTE CALLS ON ALL HER OLD FRIENDS INDEED FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS ACCORDING TO NANCY THERE WASN'T NO PUTTING OF YOUR FINGER ON HER ANYWHERES
DOCTOR CHILTON OH AUNT POLLY I'D SO LOVE TO HAVE DOCTOR CHILTON I'VE WANTED HIM ALL THE TIME BUT I WAS AFRAID YOU DIDN'T ON ACCOUNT OF HIS SEEING YOU IN THE SUN PARLOR THAT DAY YOU KNOW SO I DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING BUT
CAUSE THERE WA'N'T NO ONE ELSE SHE COULD PLAY IT WITH THOUGH SHE DID SPEAK OF HER AUNT MISS POLLY NANCY CHUCKLED I GUESS YOU HAIN'T GOT SUCH AN AWFUL DIFF'RENT OPINION O THE MISTRESS THAN I HAVE SHE BRIDLED
I HOPE YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY YOU HAVE MY BEST WISHES I'M SURE A LONG ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T OFTEN TURN OUT WELL BUT OF COURSE IN YOUR CASE IT COULDN'T BE HELPED
I'M SO GLAD YOU DO WANT HIM AUNT POLLY'S FACE HAD TURNED WHITE THEN RED THEN BACK TO WHITE AGAIN BUT WHEN SHE ANSWERED SHE SHOWED VERY PLAINLY THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO SPEAK LIGHTLY AND CHEERFULLY
I MADE THEM OF THE NICEST RAGS AND BRAIDED THEM IN STRIPES IT WAS SUCH COMPANY THESE LAST FEW WINTERS
BUT AS YET NOTHING HAD AVAILED TO STEEL HER AGAINST A REFERENCE TO HER HAIR SO IT IS SO IT IS CONCEDED MISSUS HARMON THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT QUEER FREAKS FASHION WILL TAKE
HER CHEEKS WERE VERY RED TOO I SAY IF YOU LOVED DOCTOR CHILTON AND DIDN'T LOVE THE OTHER ONE SIGHED POLLYANNA SEEMS TO ME THAT WOULD MAKE SOME DIFFERENCE IN THE GOOD HE WOULD DO AND I LOVE DOCTOR CHILTON
THERE WAS MORE EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR OF GREEN GABLES THAN THERE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE IN ALL ITS HISTORY EVEN MARILLA WAS SO EXCITED THAT SHE COULDN'T HELP SHOWING IT WHICH WAS LITTLE SHORT OF BEING PHENOMENAL
BUT THE DEEPS OF HAPPINESS BELOW COULD NOT THUS BE DISTURBED AND THE LITTLE STINGS OF MESDAMES BELL AND ANDREWS WERE FORGOTTEN WHEN GILBERT CAME LATER AND THEY WANDERED DOWN TO THE BIRCHES OF THE BROOK WHICH HAD BEEN SAPLINGS WHEN ANNE HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES
BUT I FOR REASONS WHICH I DO NOT CARE TO SPEAK OF NOW I DON'T WISH DOCTOR CHILTON CALLED IN ON ON THIS CASE AND BELIEVE ME HE CAN NOT KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT ABOUT YOUR TROUBLE AS THIS GREAT DOCTOR DOES
I CAN'T REALIZE THAT SHE'S GROWN UP I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT I FELT WHEN I SAW MATTHEW BRINGING IN A GIRL
AND THAT'S WHAT MADE ME THINK THAT IF ONLY A LOT OF MISSUS CAREW'S KIND COULD KNOW THE OTHER KIND BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T DO THE INTRODUCING I DIDN'T KNOW MANY OF THEM MYSELF ANYWAY BUT IF THEY COULD KNOW EACH OTHER
WELL SHE DIDN'T TELL MISS POLLY REJOINED NANCY MISS POLLYANNA TOLD ME LONG AGO THAT SHE COULDN'T TELL HER CAUSE HER AUNT DIDN'T LIKE TER HAVE HER TALK ABOUT HER FATHER AN TWAS HER FATHER'S GAME
FORE MISS POLLYANNA COME SAY MISTER TOM WHO WAS HER A LOVER I HAIN'T FOUND THAT OUT YET I HAIN'T I HAIN'T HAIN'T YE ASKED THE OLD MAN WITH AN ODD LOOK ON HIS FACE
GILBERT LOOKS VERY YOUNG FOR A DOCTOR I'M AFRAID PEOPLE WON'T HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM SAID MISSUS JASPER BELL GLOOMILY THEN SHE SHUT HER MOUTH TIGHTLY AS IF SHE HAD SAID WHAT SHE CONSIDERED IT HER DUTY TO SAY AND HELD HER CONSCIENCE CLEAR
THE NURSE ENTERED THE ROOM AT THAT MOMENT AND AUNT POLLY ROSE TO HER FEET ABRUPTLY A LOOK OF RELIEF ON HER FACE I AM VERY SORRY POLLYANNA SHE SAID A LITTLE STIFFLY
HER MARRIAGE HAD BEEN HAPPY WEALTH HAD NOT SPOILED HER SHE WAS STILL THE PLACID AMIABLE PINK CHEEKED JANE OF THE OLD QUARTETTE SYMPATHISING WITH HER OLD CHUM'S HAPPINESS AND AS KEENLY INTERESTED IN ALL THE DAINTY DETAILS OF ANNE'S TROUSSEAU
WELL FASHION OR NO FASHION I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING PRETTIER FOR A SPARE ROOM BED THAN A NICE APPLE LEAF SPREAD THAT'S WHAT I MUST SEE ABOUT GETTING THEM BLEACHED I'VE HAD THEM SEWED UP IN COTTON BAGS EVER SINCE THOMAS DIED
SHE SELLS BOWS LOVELY BOWS IN A BIG STORE SHE WANTS TO KNOW PEOPLE AND I INTRODUCED HER TO MISSUS CAREW AND WE HAD HER UP TO THE HOUSE AND WE HAD JAMIE AND LOTS OF OTHERS THERE TOO AND SHE WAS SO GLAD TO KNOW THEM
I RECKON MAYBE THAT'S THE PART I DON'T LIKE THE MOST THAT FOLKS DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER IT WOULD BE SUCH A LOT NICER IF THEY DID WHY JUST THINK MISTER PENDLETON THERE ARE LOTS OF FOLKS THAT LIVE ON DIRTY NARROW STREETS
BUT HER EYES WERE TROUBLED THE DOCTOR WAS OPENLY NERVOUS AND IMPATIENT MISS POLLY SAID LITTLE BUT EVEN THE SOFTENING WAVES OF HAIR ABOUT HER FACE AND THE BECOMING LACES AT HER THROAT COULD NOT HIDE THE FACT
I NEVER SUPPOSED SHE'D WANT THEM THEY'RE SO OLD FASHIONED AND NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT ANYTHING BUT HOOKED MATS NOW BUT SHE ASKED ME FOR THEM SAID SHE'D RATHER HAVE THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR HER FLOORS THEY ARE PRETTY
THE HINGES ARE ON ONE TRUNK AND THE CATCH ON THE OTHER THEIR BOUGHS FORM AN ARCH OVERHEAD OH I'M SO GLAD I COULDN'T LIVE WHERE THERE WERE NO TREES SOMETHING VITAL IN ME WOULD STARVE
AND HAVE MORE THINGS TO EAT AND WEAR THAN THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH NOW IF THOSE FOLKS ONLY KNEW THE OTHER FOLKS BUT MISTER PENDLETON INTERRUPTED WITH A LAUGH MY DEAR CHILD DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
CAUSE HE TOOK MISS JENNIE AWAY FROM EM AN MISS POLLY YOUNG AS SHE WAS COULDN'T NEVER FORGIVE HIM SHE WAS THAT FOND OF MISS JENNIE IN THEM DAYS I SEE I SEE TWAS A BAD MESS HE SIGHED AS HE TURNED AWAY
AND ONE DAY FATHER HEARD HER HE GOT AWFUL MAD SO MAD THAT I REMEMBERED IT ALWAYS WHAT HE SAID HE SAID JAMIE WASN'T NO SORT OF A NAME FOR A BOY
AND NO DOUBT THEY'RE AN AWFUL COLOR BUT THERE'S A MONTH YET AND DEW BLEACHING WILL WORK WONDERS ONLY A MONTH MARILLA SIGHED AND THEN SAID PROUDLY I'M GIVING ANNE THAT HALF DOZEN BRAIDED RUGS I HAVE IN THE GARRET
THEN SHE SAID GENTLY THOUGH YET WITH A TOUCH OF HER OLD STERN DECISIVENESS BUT I DO MIND POLLYANNA I MIND VERY MUCH I WOULD DO ANYTHING ALMOST ANYTHING FOR YOU MY DEAR
THE GODS SO SAYS THE OLD SUPERSTITION DO NOT LIKE TO BEHOLD TOO HAPPY MORTALS IT IS CERTAIN AT LEAST THAT SOME HUMAN BEINGS DO NOT
WITH HIS EYES TURNED AWAY YET THERE WAS A CURIOUS SOFTNESS IN HIS VOICE THAT WAS ALWAYS NOTICEABLE WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF HIS FATHER YOU YES TWAS JUST A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE HE DIED
AN I DECLARE TER GOODNESS IF MISS POLLY HAIN'T
IT SEEMS REAL STRANGE
IF IF YOU DON'T MIND VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DOCTOR CHILTON TRULY I WOULD A DISTRESSED COLOR SUFFUSED MISS POLLY'S FACE FOR A MOMENT SHE DID NOT SPEAK AT ALL
I WONDER WHAT HIS FATE WAS WELL IT WAS A FORTUNATE MISTAKE SAID MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE THOUGH MIND YOU THERE WAS A TIME I DIDN'T THINK SO THAT EVENING I CAME UP TO SEE ANNE AND SHE TREATED US TO SUCH A SCENE
AND I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE CUT DOWN AND THIS LAST SPRING THEY WERE WHITE AND SUCH A CROP OF PLUMS I NEVER REMEMBER AT GREEN GABLES
CAUSE I WAS ALREADY BENT PART WAY OVER NANCY GAVE A WISTFUL LAUGH WELL I AIN'T SURPRISED AFTER ALL YOU MIGHT KNOW SHE'D FIND SOMETHIN WE'VE BEEN PLAYIN IT THAT GAME SINCE ALMOST THE FIRST
BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO LET ME BE THE JUDGE THIS TIME BESIDES IT'S ALREADY ARRANGED THE NEW YORK DOCTOR IS COMING TO MORROW AS IT HAPPENED HOWEVER THE NEW YORK DOCTOR DID NOT COME TO MORROW
ON MOST OCCASIONS SHE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THE INTEREST SHOWN BUT ONE DAY SHE MET WITH A SURPRISE IT CAME THROUGH JIMMY PENDLETON SAY LOOK A HERE HE DEMANDED ONE AFTERNOON IRRITABLY
OLD TOM STIFFENED I WAS ONLY THINKIN TWOULD BE SOME OF A SURPRISE TO HER HE EXPLAINED WITH DIGNITY
CAME WITH HER MOTHER AND MISSUS JASPER BELL BUT IN JANE THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS HAD NOT BEEN CURDLED BY YEARS OF MATRIMONIAL BICKERINGS HER LINES HAD FALLEN IN PLEASANT PLACES IN SPITE OF THE FACT AS MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WOULD SAY
WHICH WOULD BE SO EASY NOW YOU KNOW BUT AS BEFORE AUNT POLLY SHOOK HER HEAD AND SAID NO DEAR VERY DECISIVELY
GROWING MORE AND MORE JEALOUS MOMENT BY MOMENT STILL DOGGEDLY HE HELD HIS GROUND WELL ANYHOW HE SCOFFED I DON'T THINK MUCH OF HIS NAME JAMIE HUMPH SOUNDS SISSY
WHO OWNS THE HOUSE WELL IT'S THE PROPERTY OF THE GLEN SAINT MARY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH NOW AND I RENTED IT FROM THE TRUSTEES BUT IT BELONGED UNTIL LATELY TO A VERY OLD LADY MISS ELIZABETH RUSSELL
BRIDLED THE LITTLE GIRL AGGRIEVEDLY AS THE MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH AND ANYWAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOME FOLKS SHOULD HAVE SUCH A LOT AND OTHER FOLKS SHOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING AND I DON'T LIKE IT
OLD TOM CHUCKLED WELL IT STRIKES ME MISS POLLY HERSELF AIN'T LOOKIN NONE THE WORSE FOR WEARIN THEM ERE CURLS ROUND HER FOREHEAD HE OBSERVED DRYLY COURSE SHE AIN'T RETORTED NANCY INDIGNANTLY
MARILLA FELT THAT IN SOME STRANGE WAY HIS MARRIAGE WITH ANNE WOULD PUT RIGHT THAT OLD MISTAKE GOOD HAD COME OUT OF THE EVIL OF THE ANCIENT BITTERNESS AS FOR ANNE HERSELF SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE ALMOST FELT FRIGHTENED
WHO WILL COME FROM NEW YORK TO MORROW POLLYANNA STILL LOOKED UNCONVINCED BUT AUNT POLLY IF YOU LOVED DOCTOR CHILTON WHAT POLLYANNA AUNT POLLY'S VOICE WAS VERY SHARP NOW
GRINNED OLD TOM THEN ABRUPTLY THE LIGHT DIED FROM HIS EYES HOW IS SHE TER DAY THE LITTLE GAL NANCY SHOOK HER HEAD HER FACE TOO HAD SOBERED JUST THE SAME MISTER TOM
JANE WAS NOT BRILLIANT AND HAD PROBABLY NEVER MADE A REMARK WORTH LISTENING TO IN HER LIFE BUT SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING THAT WOULD HURT ANYONE'S FEELINGS WHICH MAY BE A NEGATIVE TALENT BUT IS LIKEWISE A RARE AND ENVIABLE ONE
TWO OF THAT ILK DESCENDED UPON ANNE ONE VIOLET DUSK AND PROCEEDED TO DO WHAT IN THEM LAY TO PRICK THE RAINBOW BUBBLE OF HER SATISFACTION IF SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GETTING ANY PARTICULAR PRIZE IN YOUNG DOCTOR BLYTHE
NO THERE'S PARTS OF IT OH I WAS GLAD TO BE THERE SHE EXPLAINED HASTILY I HAD A PERFECTLY LOVELY TIME AND LOTS OF THINGS WERE SO QUEER AND DIFFERENT YOU KNOW
I'D BELIEVE ANYTHIN O THE MISTRESS NOW EVEN THAT SHE'D TAKE TER PLAYIN IT HERSELF BUT HAIN'T THE LITTLE GAL TOLD HER EVER SHE'S TOLD EV'RY ONE ELSE I GUESS I'M HEARIN OF IT EV'RYWHERE NOW SINCE SHE WAS HURTED SAID TOM
FOR WHO BETTER THAN HIMSELF COULD UNDERSTAND THE NEED OF A CHILD'S PRESENCE FOR THAT MATTER POLLYANNA TALKED TO EVERYBODY ABOUT JAMIE SHE ASSUMED THAT EVERYBODY WOULD BE AS INTERESTED AS SHE HERSELF WAS
IN TALKING OF JAMIE POLLYANNA LOST HER WORRIED BAFFLED LOOK POLLYANNA LOVED TO TALK OF JAMIE HERE WAS SOMETHING SHE UNDERSTOOD HERE WAS NO PROBLEM
AND YOU'VE KNOWN ME EVER SINCE REPEATED JIMMY BUT IN A FAR DIFFERENT VOICE JIMMY HAD SUDDENLY COME BACK TO THE PRESENT AND TO HIS GRIEVANCE BUT THEN I AIN'T JAMIE YOU KNOW HE FINISHED WITH SCORNFUL EMPHASIS
SHE DIDN'T KNOW EM HERSELF SHE SAID FOLKS DIDN'T DOWN THERE THERE WAS A SLIGHT PAUSE THEN WITH A SIGH POLLYANNA RESUMED
I COULDN'T GUESS I WOULDN'T THINK SHE COULD FIND ANYTHIN ABOUT THAT TER BE GLAD ABOUT SHE DID SHE SAID I COULD BE GLAD ANYHOW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TER STOOP SO FAR TER DO MY WEEDIN
IF TAIN'T MORE THAN TER LET IN THE CAT AN HER WHAT WOULDN'T LET FLUFF NOR BUFF UP STAIRS FOR LOVE NOR MONEY A WEEK AGO
BUT WERE NOW TALL IVORY COLUMNS IN A FAIRY PALACE OF TWILIGHT AND STARS IN THEIR SHADOWS ANNE AND GILBERT TALKED IN LOVER FASHION OF THEIR NEW HOME AND THEIR NEW LIFE TOGETHER I'VE FOUND A NEST FOR US ANNE OH WHERE
YES TWAS ALL ROUND ALL ROUND SIGHED NANCY IN HER TURN AS SHE WENT BACK TO HER KITCHEN FOR NO ONE WERE THOSE DAYS OF WAITING EASY THE NURSE TRIED TO LOOK CHEERFUL
WASN'T THERE ANYBODY ELSE DOWN TO BOSTON BUT JUST THAT EVERLASTING JAMIE WHY JIMMY BEAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED POLLYANNA THE BOY LIFTED HIS CHIN A LITTLE
THERE IS A BIG GROVE OF FIR TREES BEHIND IT TWO ROWS OF LOMBARDY POPLARS DOWN THE LANE AND A RING OF WHITE BIRCHES AROUND A VERY DELIGHTFUL GARDEN OUR FRONT DOOR OPENS RIGHT INTO THE GARDEN
THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T CARE TO KNOW EACH OTHER HE ASKED QUIZZICALLY OH BUT SOME OF THEM DO MAINTAINED POLLYANNA IN EAGER DEFENSE
IT WAS SURELY THEIR DUTY TO PUT THE MATTER BEFORE HER IN ANOTHER LIGHT YET THESE TWO WORTHY LADIES WERE NOT ENEMIES OF ANNE ON THE CONTRARY THEY WERE REALLY QUITE FOND OF HER
AS WAS USUALLY THE CASE WHEN THIS QUESTION WAS PUT TO HER SHE BEGAN HER REPLY WITH A TROUBLED FROWN OH I LIKED IT I JUST LOVED IT SOME OF IT BUT NOT ALL OF IT SMILED MISTER PENDLETON
OH YES SHE TOLD ME LONG AGO THE OLD MAN HESITATED THEN WENT ON HIS LIPS TWITCHING A LITTLE I WAS GROWLIN ONE DAY CAUSE I WAS SO BENT UP AND CROOKED AN WHAT DO YE S'POSE THE LITTLE THING SAID
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED FOLKS COMMENTED THE MAN I DO POLLYANNA FROWNED AGAIN AND PONDERED BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF SUCH A LOT OF THEM IF YOU DON'T KNOW EM AND MISSUS CAREW WOULDN'T LET ME
SHE'S SENT TIMOTHY DOWN TER COBB'S GREENHOUSE THREE TIMES FOR FRESH FLOWERS AN THAT BESIDES ALL THE POSIES FETCHED IN TER HER TOO AN THE OTHER DAY IF I DIDN'T FIND HER SITTIN
BUT THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO LACK OF JOYFUL GREETINGS ON THE PART OF EVERYBODY FROM THE MOMENT SHE STEPPED FROM THE RAILWAY TRAIN WITH HER AUNT POLLY AND DOCTOR CHILTON NOR DID POLLYANNA LOSE ANY TIME
WE STOPPED MOST A WEEK WITH A FARMER DAD HELPED ABOUT THE HAYIN' AND I DID TOO SOME THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS AWFUL GOOD TO ME AND PRETTY QUICK SHE WAS CALLIN ME JAMIE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT SHE JUST DID
HUMAN NATURE IS NOT OBLIGED TO BE CONSISTENT
YES RETURNED MISTER LORRY DRYING HIS EYES YOU ARE RIGHT BUT HE WILL PERISH THERE IS NO REAL HOPE YES HE WILL PERISH THERE IS NO REAL HOPE ECHOED CARTON
THE WRETCHED WIFE OF THE INNOCENT MAN THUS DOOMED TO DIE FELL UNDER THE SENTENCE AS IF SHE HAD BEEN MORTALLY STRICKEN BUT SHE UTTERED NO SOUND AND SO STRONG WAS THE VOICE WITHIN HER REPRESENTING THAT IT WAS SHE OF ALL THE WORLD WHO MUST UPHOLD HIM IN HIS MISERY
STRAIN IT THROUGH A COLANDER AND SKIM OFF ALL THE FAT THAT IS ON THE TOP SET IT AWAY TO COOL AND WHEN THE JELLY IS QUITE STIFF WIPE IT WITH A TOWEL TO TAKE OFF ANY GREASE THAT SHOULD REMAIN
AND PEACH KERNELS POUR BOILING WATER ON THEM WHICH WILL MAKE THEM PEEL EASILY EITHER ROLL THEM WITH A BOTTLE ON THE CAKE BOARD OR POUND IN A MORTAR WITH A LITTLE LOAF SUGAR THEY SHOULD NOT BE POUNDED TOO MUCH OR THEY WILL BE OILY
WHEN EGGS ARE USED IN CALF'S FOOT AND OTHER JELLIES CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO HAVE THE INGREDIENTS COOL
THE LAST CHANCE IS GONE IT WAS NOT MUCH YES HE HAD BETTER BE TAKEN TO HER BUT BEFORE YOU GO WILL YOU FOR A MOMENT STEADILY ATTEND TO ME DON'T ASK ME WHY I MAKE THE STIPULATIONS I AM GOING TO MAKE
FOLLOWED SYDNEY TO THE OUTER DOOR AND TOUCHING HIM ON THE SHOULDER AS HE WAS GOING AWAY CAUSED HIM TO TURN I HAVE NO HOPE SAID MISTER LORRY IN A LOW AND SORROWFUL WHISPER NOR HAVE I IF ANY ONE OF THESE MEN
AND WITH A RADIANT LOOK UPON HER FACE IN WHICH THERE WAS EVEN A COMFORTING SMILE AS HE WENT OUT AT THE PRISONERS DOOR SHE TURNED LAID HER HEAD LOVINGLY ON HER FATHER'S BREAST TRIED TO SPEAK TO HIM AND FELL AT HIS FEET
BUT ONLY ELICITED FROM HIS OWN WIFE A REPETITION OF HER LAST REPLY TELL THE WIND AND THE FIRE WHERE TO STOP NOT ME CUSTOMERS ENTERED AND THE GROUP WAS BROKEN UP THE ENGLISH CUSTOMER PAID FOR WHAT HE HAD HAD

THEN ISSUING FROM THE OBSCURE CORNER FROM WHICH HE HAD NEVER MOVED SYDNEY CARTON CAME AND TOOK HER UP ONLY HER FATHER AND MISTER LORRY WERE WITH HER HIS ARM TREMBLED AS IT RAISED HER AND SUPPORTED HER HEAD YET
SYDNEY CARTON PAUSED IN THE STREET NOT QUITE DECIDED WHERE TO GO AT TELLSON'S BANKING HOUSE AT NINE HE SAID WITH A MUSING FACE SHALL I DO WELL IN THE MEAN TIME TO SHOW MYSELF I THINK SO

PROMISE ME SOLEMNLY THAT NOTHING WILL INFLUENCE YOU TO ALTER THE COURSE ON WHICH WE NOW STAND PLEDGED TO ONE ANOTHER NOTHING CARTON REMEMBER THESE WORDS TO MORROW CHANGE THE COURSE OR DELAY IN IT FOR ANY REASON AND NO LIFE
IT IS SO ASSENTED DEFARGE AGAIN I COMMUNICATE TO HIM THAT SECRET I SMITE THIS BOSOM WITH THESE TWO HANDS AS I SMITE IT NOW AND I TELL HIM DEFARGE I WAS BROUGHT UP AMONG THE FISHERMEN OF THE SEA SHORE
HIS LONELY DAUGHTER BEREFT OF HER FINAL HOPE AND RELIANCE APPEALED TO THEM BOTH TOO STRONGLY AGAIN AS IF BY AGREEMENT THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER WITH ONE MEANING IN THEIR FACES CARTON WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
AND THEN ADVANCED TO HIM HERSELF AND ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS HE HAD ORDERED HE REPEATED WHAT HE HAD ALREADY SAID ENGLISH ASKED MADAME DEFARGE INQUISITIVELY RAISING HER DARK EYEBROWS
IT IS GOOD UNTIL RECALLED BUT IT MAY BE SOON RECALLED AND I HAVE REASON TO THINK WILL BE THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER THEY ARE IN GREAT DANGER THEY ARE IN DANGER OF DENUNCIATION BY MADAME DEFARGE
FOR OTHER CRIMES AS TYRANTS AND OPPRESSORS I HAVE THIS RACE A LONG TIME ON MY REGISTER DOOMED TO DESTRUCTION AND EXTERMINATION ASK MY HUSBAND IS THAT SO IT IS SO ASSENTED DEFARGE WITHOUT BEING ASKED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT DAYS
ICE CREAM WITH FRUIT MIX THE JUICE OF THE FRUIT WITH AS MUCH SUGAR AS WILL BE WANTED BEFORE YOU ADD THE CREAM WHICH NEED NOT BE VERY RICH POKEBERRY JUICE TO STAIN ICES MASH AND STRAIN RIPE POKEBERRIES
THEY WERE DISCUSSING THIS QUESTION AND WERE ALMOST BUILDING UP SOME WEAK STRUCTURE OF HOPE ON HIS PROLONGED ABSENCE WHEN THEY HEARD HIM ON THE STAIRS THE INSTANT HE ENTERED THE ROOM IT WAS PLAIN THAT ALL WAS LOST
ALL OF PITY THAT HAD A FLUSH OF PRIDE IN IT SHALL I TAKE HER TO A COACH I SHALL NEVER FEEL HER WEIGHT HE CARRIED HER LIGHTLY TO THE DOOR AND LAID HER TENDERLY DOWN IN A COACH HER FATHER AND THEIR OLD FRIEND
MISTER LORRY LEANED HIS ARM UPON THE DOOR POST AND BOWED HIS FACE UPON IT DON'T DESPOND SAID CARTON VERY GENTLY DON'T GRIEVE I ENCOURAGED DOCTOR MANETTE IN THIS IDEA BECAUSE I FELT THAT IT MIGHT ONE DAY BE
PUT A QUART OF WATER BOIL IT DOWN TO A PINT AND STRAIN IT THROUGH A FLANNEL BAG ADD SOME SUGAR AND WINE STIR IT AND PUT IT IN GLASSES BLANCMANGE SHAVE AN OUNCE OF ISINGLASS AND DISSOLVE IT IN BOILING WATER
THE AMIABLE VENGEANCE ADDED WITH A LAUGH YES MY FAITH AND YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE TO SEEING HIM ONCE MORE TO MORROW CARTON FOLLOWED THE LINES AND WORDS OF HIS PAPER WITH A SLOW FOREFINGER
NOW TAKE THIS PAPER THAT DOCTOR MANETTE HAS CARRIED ABOUT HIM IT IS A SIMILAR CERTIFICATE ENABLING HIM AND HIS DAUGHTER AND HER CHILD AT ANY TIME TO PASS THE BARRIER AND THE FRONTIER YOU SEE YES
MY PARTING BLESSING ON MY LOVE WE SHALL MEET AGAIN WHERE THE WEARY ARE AT REST THEY WERE HER HUSBAND'S WORDS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS BOSOM I CAN BEAR IT DEAR CHARLES I AM SUPPORTED FROM ABOVE
WHEN THE BASTILLE FALLS HE FINDS THIS PAPER OF TO DAY AND HE BRINGS IT HOME AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN THIS PLACE IS CLEAR AND SHUT WE READ IT HERE ON THIS SPOT BY THE LIGHT OF THIS LAMP ASK HIM IS THAT SO
THOUGH HE SAID IT WITH A GRAVE SMILE OF EARNESTNESS AND THOUGH HE EVEN PUT THE OLD MAN'S HAND TO HIS LIPS HE DID NOT PART FROM HIM THEN HE HELPED HIM SO FAR TO AROUSE THE ROCKING FIGURE BEFORE THE DYING EMBERS AS TO GET A CLOAK AND HAT PUT UPON IT
TO EACH PINT OF JUICE PUT A POUND OF SUGAR BOIL THEM TOGETHER TILL IT BECOMES A JELLY WHEN COLD PUT IT IN A JAR AND TIE IT CLOSE USE A SMALL QUANTITY OF THIS TO STAIN ICE CREAM OR JELLY
GOT INTO IT AND HE TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE THE DRIVER WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE GATEWAY WHERE HE HAD PAUSED IN THE DARK NOT MANY HOURS BEFORE TO PICTURE TO HIMSELF ON WHICH OF THE ROUGH STONES OF THE STREET HER FEET HAD TRODDEN HE LIFTED HER AGAIN
NOT IF TO LIFT THIS GLASS WOULD DO IT BUT I WOULD LEAVE THE MATTER THERE I SAY STOP THERE SEE YOU THEN JACQUES SAID MADAME DEFARGE WRATHFULLY AND SEE YOU TOO MY LITTLE VENGEANCE SEE YOU BOTH LISTEN
WHILE SHE ONLY FAINTS OH CARTON CARTON DEAR CARTON CRIED LITTLE LUCIE SPRINGING UP AND THROWING HER ARMS PASSIONATELY ROUND HIM IN A BURST OF GRIEF NOW THAT YOU HAVE COME I THINK YOU WILL DO SOMETHING TO HELP MAMMA
CONSOLATORY TO HER
BUT I WILL DO MY DUTY WHILE I CAN AND WHEN I LEAVE HER GOD WILL RAISE UP FRIENDS FOR HER AS HE DID FOR ME HER FATHER HAD FOLLOWED HER AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN ON HIS KNEES TO BOTH OF THEM BUT THAT DARNAY PUT OUT A HAND AND SEIZED HIM CRYING NO NO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
AND TO LET IT FALL WITH A RATTLE ON THE LEDGE BEFORE HER AS IF THE AXE HAD DROPPED THE CITIZENESS IS SUPERB CROAKED THE JURYMAN SHE IS AN ANGEL SAID THE VENGEANCE AND EMBRACED HER
TO ONE PINT OF CALF'S FOOT JELLY ADD A PINT OF CREAM A LITTLE MACE AND A QUARTER OF A POUND OF LOAF SUGAR BOIL IT FIFTEEN MINUTES STIRRING IT CONSTANTLY STRAIN IT THROUGH A FLANNEL BAG AND WHEN NEARLY COLD PUT IN N GLASS OF WHITE WINE
WHEN THE CREAM IS PUT IN A MOULD CLOSE IT AND MOVE IT IN THE ICE AS YOU CANNOT USE A SPOON WITHOUT WASTE ICE CREAM WITH LEMON ROLL TWO FRESH LEMONS IN AS MUCH POWDERED LOAF SUGAR AS WILL SWEETEN A QUART OF CREAM
AND CARRIED HER UP THE STAIRCASE TO THEIR ROOMS THERE HE LAID HER DOWN ON A COUCH WHERE HER CHILD AND MISS PROSS WEPT OVER HER DON'T RECALL HER TO HERSELF HE SAID SOFTLY TO THE LATTER SHE IS BETTER SO DON'T REVIVE HER TO CONSCIOUSNESS
AND NOT AUGMENT IT THAT IT QUICKLY RAISED HER EVEN FROM THAT SHOCK THE JUDGES HAVING TO TAKE PART IN A PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION OUT OF DOORS THE TRIBUNAL ADJOURNED THE QUICK NOISE AND MOVEMENT OF THE COURT'S EMPTYING ITSELF
IT WAS REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS THAT WHEN HE BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED HER FACE WITH HIS LIPS HE MURMURED SOME WORDS THE CHILD WHO WAS NEAREST TO HIM TOLD THEM AFTERWARDS AND TOLD HER GRANDCHILDREN WHEN SHE WAS A HANDSOME OLD LADY THAT SHE HEARD HIM SAY A LIFE YOU LOVE
AND EXACT THE PROMISE I AM GOING TO EXACT I HAVE A REASON A GOOD ONE I DO NOT DOUBT IT ANSWERED MISTER LORRY SAY ON THE FIGURE IN THE CHAIR BETWEEN THEM WAS ALL THE TIME MONOTONOUSLY ROCKING ITSELF TO AND FRO AND MOANING
HE RETURNED THE ANSWER IN GREAT TROUBLE AND VERY SLOWLY TRY THEM AGAIN THE HOURS BETWEEN THIS AND TO MORROW AFTERNOON ARE FEW AND SHORT BUT TRY I INTEND TO TRY I WILL NOT REST A MOMENT
WE KNOW NOW WHAT YOU UNDERWENT WHEN YOU SUSPECTED MY DESCENT AND WHEN YOU KNEW IT WE KNOW NOW THE NATURAL ANTIPATHY YOU STROVE AGAINST AND CONQUERED FOR HER DEAR SAKE
WHERE IS MY BENCH I HAVE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR MY BENCH AND I CAN'T FIND IT WHAT HAVE THEY DONE WITH MY WORK TIME PRESSES I MUST FINISH THOSE SHOES THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND THEIR HEARTS DIED WITHIN THEM COME

LET ME GET TO WORK GIVE ME MY WORK RECEIVING NO ANSWER HE TORE HIS HAIR AND BEAT HIS FEET UPON THE GROUND LIKE A DISTRACTED CHILD DON'T TORTURE A POOR FORLORN WRETCH HE IMPLORED THEM WITH A DREADFUL CRY BUT GIVE ME MY WORK
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US IF THOSE SHOES ARE NOT DONE TO NIGHT LOST UTTERLY LOST IT WAS SO CLEARLY BEYOND HOPE TO REASON WITH HIM OR TRY TO RESTORE HIM THAT AS IF BY AGREEMENT THEY EACH PUT A HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
HEAVEN GRANT I MAY CARTON BUT HOW I AM GOING TO TELL YOU HOW IT WILL DEPEND ON YOU AND IT COULD DEPEND ON NO BETTER MAN THIS NEW DENUNCIATION WILL CERTAINLY NOT TAKE PLACE UNTIL AFTER TO MORROW
I HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE REPEATED MADAME CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND ANGRILY YES I HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE I HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE TO BE NOT THE FACE OF A TRUE FRIEND OF THE REPUBLIC LET HIM TAKE CARE OF HIS FACE
KEEP IT CORKED UP IN A BOTTLE TO SEASON ICE CREAM SYRUP OF LEMON JUICE DISSOLVE THREE POUNDS OF LOAF SUGAR IN THREE QUARTS OF WATER SQUEEZE AND STRAIN LEMONS ENOUGH TO MAKE A QUART OF JUICE BOIL IT SLOWLY WITH THE WATER AND SUGAR AND TAKE OFF THE SCUM AS IT RISES
EARLY TO MORROW HAVE YOUR HORSES READY SO THAT THEY MAY BE IN STARTING TRIM AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT SHALL BE DONE HIS MANNER WAS SO FERVENT AND INSPIRING THAT MISTER LORRY CAUGHT THE FLAME AND WAS AS QUICK AS YOUTH YOU ARE A NOBLE HEART
FOR THE SAKE OF HER CHILD AND HER FATHER PRESS UPON HER THE NECESSITY OF LEAVING PARIS WITH THEM AND YOU AT THAT HOUR TELL HER THAT IT WAS HER HUSBAND'S LAST ARRANGEMENT
BOTH HER HEARERS DERIVED A HORRIBLE ENJOYMENT FROM THE DEADLY NATURE OF HER WRATH THE LISTENER COULD FEEL HOW WHITE SHE WAS WITHOUT SEEING HER AND BOTH HIGHLY COMMENDED IT DEFARGE A WEAK MINORITY INTERPOSED A FEW WORDS FOR THE MEMORY OF THE COMPASSIONATE WIFE OF THE MARQUIS
AND THEN FOR ENGLAND WHY THEN SAID MISTER LORRY GRASPING HIS EAGER BUT SO FIRM AND STEADY HAND IT DOES NOT ALL DEPEND ON ONE OLD MAN BUT I SHALL HAVE A YOUNG AND ARDENT MAN AT MY SIDE BY THE HELP OF HEAVEN YOU SHALL
THAT BROTHER WAS MY BROTHER THAT FATHER WAS MY FATHER
YOU KNOW IT IS A CAPITAL CRIME TO MOURN FOR OR SYMPATHISE WITH A VICTIM OF THE GUILLOTINE SHE AND HER FATHER WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY BE GUILTY OF THIS CRIME AND THIS WOMAN THE INVETERACY OF WHOSE PURSUIT CANNOT BE DESCRIBED
HAVING ASCERTAINED ITS SITUATION CARTON CAME OUT OF THOSE CLOSER STREETS AGAIN AND DINED AT A PLACE OF REFRESHMENT AND FELL SOUND ASLEEP AFTER DINNER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS HE HAD NO STRONG DRINK
WILL SUBMIT HIMSELF TO HER DO YOU NOT I AM SURE OF IT I THOUGHT SO QUIETLY AND STEADILY HAVE ALL THESE ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN THE COURTYARD HERE EVEN TO THE TAKING OF YOUR OWN SEAT IN THE CARRIAGE
IT IS A SOUND PRECAUTION AND MAY BE A NECESSARY PREPARATION BUT CARE CARE CARE LET ME THINK IT OUT CHECKING HIS STEPS WHICH HAD BEGUN TO TEND TOWARDS AN OBJECT
THEY SPOKE IN SUCH A TONE AS THEY WOULD HAVE USED IF THEY HAD BEEN WATCHING BY A SICK BED IN THE NIGHT CARTON STOOPED TO PICK UP THE COAT WHICH LAY ALMOST ENTANGLING HIS FEET
THE ENGLISH CUSTOMER WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS REFLECTIONS THEN THAT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD DEED TO SEIZE THAT ARM LIFT IT AND STRIKE UNDER IT SHARP AND DEEP BUT HE WENT HIS WAY AND WAS SOON SWALLOWED UP IN THE SHADOW OF THE PRISON WALL
PERPLEXEDLY COUNTED HIS CHANGE AND ASKED AS A STRANGER TO BE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE NATIONAL PALACE MADAME DEFARGE TOOK HIM TO THE DOOR AND PUT HER ARM ON HIS IN POINTING OUT THE ROAD
OF LITTLE WORTH AS LIFE IS WHEN WE MISUSE IT IT IS WORTH THAT EFFORT IT WOULD COST NOTHING TO LAY DOWN IF IT WERE NOT I WILL GO SAID DOCTOR MANETTE TO THE PROSECUTOR AND THE PRESIDENT STRAIGHT
AND SLIGHTLY ALTERED THE DISORDERED ARRANGEMENT OF HIS LOOSE CRAVAT AND HIS COAT COLLAR AND HIS WILD HAIR THIS DONE HE WENT ON DIRECT TO DEFARGE'S AND WENT IN THERE HAPPENED TO BE NO CUSTOMER IN THE SHOP BUT JACQUES THREE
BY MANY PASSAGES HAD NOT CEASED WHEN LUCIE STOOD STRETCHING OUT HER ARMS TOWARDS HER HUSBAND WITH NOTHING IN HER FACE BUT LOVE AND CONSOLATION IF I MIGHT TOUCH HIM IF I MIGHT EMBRACE HIM ONCE O GOOD CITIZENS IF YOU WOULD HAVE SO MUCH COMPASSION FOR US
AFTER LOOKING AT HER AS IF THE SOUND OF EVEN A SINGLE FRENCH WORD WERE SLOW TO EXPRESS ITSELF TO HIM HE ANSWERED IN HIS FORMER STRONG FOREIGN ACCENT YES MADAME YES I AM ENGLISH
CAN POSSIBLY BE SAVED AND MANY LIVES MUST INEVITABLY BE SACRIFICED I WILL REMEMBER THEM I HOPE TO DO MY PART FAITHFULLY AND I HOPE TO DO MINE NOW GOOD BYE
WHEN HE HAD GONE OUT INTO THE NEXT ROOM HE TURNED SUDDENLY ON MISTER LORRY AND HER FATHER WHO WERE FOLLOWING AND SAID TO THE LATTER YOU HAD GREAT INFLUENCE BUT YESTERDAY DOCTOR MANETTE LET IT AT LEAST BE TRIED
HE KNOWS THAT A WOOD SAWYER LIVING BY THE PRISON WALL IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE DEFARGES AND HAS BEEN REHEARSED BY MADAME DEFARGE AS TO HIS HAVING SEEN HER HE NEVER MENTIONED LUCIE'S NAME MAKING SIGNS AND SIGNALS TO PRISONERS
HE TOOK A TURN OR TWO IN THE ALREADY DARKENING STREET AND TRACED THE THOUGHT IN HIS MIND TO ITS POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES HIS FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CONFIRMED IT IS BEST HE SAID FINALLY RESOLVED
AS THAT BASTILLE PAPER DESCRIBES IS MY FAMILY DEFARGE THAT SISTER OF THE MORTALLY WOUNDED BOY UPON THE GROUND WAS MY SISTER THAT HUSBAND WAS MY SISTER'S HUSBAND THAT UNBORN CHILD WAS THEIR CHILD
THESE JUDGES AND ALL THE MEN IN POWER ARE VERY FRIENDLY TO YOU AND VERY RECOGNISANT OF YOUR SERVICES ARE THEY NOT NOTHING CONNECTED WITH CHARLES WAS CONCEALED FROM ME I HAD THE STRONGEST ASSURANCES THAT I SHOULD SAVE HIM AND I DID
AT THE APPOINTED HOUR HE EMERGED FROM IT TO PRESENT HIMSELF IN MISTER LORRY'S ROOM AGAIN WHERE HE FOUND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WALKING TO AND FRO IN RESTLESS ANXIETY HE SAID HE HAD BEEN WITH LUCIE UNTIL JUST NOW
SINCE LAST NIGHT HE HAD TAKEN NOTHING BUT A LITTLE LIGHT THIN WINE
AS TO THEE PURSUED MADAME IMPLACABLY ADDRESSING HER HUSBAND IF IT DEPENDED ON THEE WHICH HAPPILY IT DOES NOT THOU WOULDST RESCUE THIS MAN EVEN NOW NO PROTESTED DEFARGE
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU SPEED THOUGH MIND I EXPECT NOTHING WHEN ARE YOU LIKELY TO HAVE SEEN THESE DREAD POWERS DOCTOR MANETTE IMMEDIATELY AFTER DARK I SHOULD HOPE WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO FROM THIS
EXTERMINATION IS GOOD DOCTRINE MY WIFE SAID DEFARGE RATHER TROUBLED IN GENERAL I SAY NOTHING AGAINST IT BUT THIS DOCTOR HAS SUFFERED MUCH YOU HAVE SEEN HIM TO DAY YOU HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE WHEN THE PAPER WAS READ
OF THE RESTLESS FINGERS AND THE CROAKING VOICE THIS MAN WHOM HE HAD SEEN UPON THE JURY STOOD DRINKING AT THE LITTLE COUNTER IN CONVERSATION WITH THE DEFARGES MAN AND WIFE THE VENGEANCE ASSISTED IN THE CONVERSATION LIKE A REGULAR MEMBER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
THE MOMENT I COME TO YOU TAKE ME IN AND DRIVE AWAY I UNDERSTAND THAT I WAIT FOR YOU UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES YOU HAVE MY CERTIFICATE IN YOUR HAND WITH THE REST YOU KNOW AND WILL RESERVE MY PLACE WAIT FOR NOTHING BUT TO HAVE MY PLACE OCCUPIED
IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE SAID THE PRISONER ALL THINGS HAVE WORKED TOGETHER AS THEY HAVE FALLEN OUT IT WAS THE ALWAYS VAIN ENDEAVOUR TO DISCHARGE MY POOR MOTHER'S TRUST THAT FIRST BROUGHT MY FATAL PRESENCE NEAR YOU GOOD COULD NEVER COME OF SUCH EVIL
AND HAD ONLY LEFT HER FOR A FEW MINUTES TO COME AND KEEP HIS APPOINTMENT HER FATHER HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE HE QUITTED THE BANKING HOUSE TOWARDS FOUR O'CLOCK SHE HAD SOME FAINT HOPES THAT HIS MEDIATION MIGHT SAVE CHARLES BUT THEY WERE VERY SLIGHT
AND HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS SAINT ANTOINE DEFARGE HAD DESCRIBED HIMSELF THAT DAY AS THE KEEPER OF A WINE SHOP IN THE SAINT ANTOINE SUBURB IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ONE WHO KNEW THE CITY WELL TO FIND HIS HOUSE WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTION
THAT'S WELL I HAVE KNOWN SUCH ENERGY AS YOURS DO GREAT THINGS BEFORE NOW THOUGH NEVER HE ADDED WITH A SMILE AND A SIGH TOGETHER SUCH GREAT THINGS AS THIS BUT TRY
SEASON IT WITH A FEW DROPS OF ESSENCE OF LEMON OR SYRUP OF LEMON PEEL AND POWDERED WHITE SUGAR AND IF YOU CHOOSE A SPOONFUL OF PRESERVE SYRUP AND JUST AS YOU SEND IT TO TABLE
IT IS EASY TO FORESEE THAT THE PRETENCE WILL BE THE COMMON ONE A PRISON PLOT AND THAT IT WILL INVOLVE HER LIFE AND PERHAPS HER CHILD'S AND PERHAPS HER FATHER'S FOR BOTH HAVE BEEN SEEN WITH HER AT THAT PLACE DON'T LOOK SO HORRIFIED YOU WILL SAVE THEM ALL
AND TO TEMPT IT FORTH TO FIND WHERE THE BENCH AND WORK WERE HIDDEN THAT IT STILL MOANINGLY BESOUGHT TO HAVE HE WALKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND PROTECTED IT TO THE COURTYARD OF THE HOUSE WHERE THE AFFLICTED HEART SO HAPPY IN THE MEMORABLE TIME
WHO HAD DONE WITH IT IT WAS AS LATE AS SEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN HE AWOKE REFRESHED AND WENT OUT INTO THE STREETS AGAIN AS HE PASSED ALONG TOWARDS SAINT ANTOINE HE STOPPED AT A SHOP WINDOW WHERE THERE WAS A MIRROR
ONE GALLON OF CREAM TWO POUNDS ROLLED LOAF SUGAR ONE TEA SPOONFUL OF OIL OF LEMON IF FOR VANILLA CREAM USE A TABLE SPOONFUL OF TINCTURE OF VANILLA TWO EGGS BEATEN MIX WELL AND FREEZE IN THE USUAL WAY
I HAVE OBSERVED HER TO DAY AND I HAVE OBSERVED HER OTHER DAYS I HAVE OBSERVED HER IN THE COURT AND I HAVE OBSERVED HER IN THE STREET BY THE PRISON LET ME BUT LIFT MY FINGER SHE SEEMED TO RAISE IT THE LISTENER'S EYES WERE ALWAYS ON HIS PAPER
DEFARGE BROUGHT HIM THE WINE AND GAVE HIM GOOD EVENING HOW GOOD EVENING OH GOOD EVENING CITIZEN FILLING HIS GLASS AH AND GOOD WINE I DRINK TO THE REPUBLIC
HE BENT OVER THE CHILD AND LAID HER BLOOMING CHEEK AGAINST HIS FACE HE PUT HER GENTLY FROM HIM AND LOOKED AT HER UNCONSCIOUS MOTHER BEFORE I GO HE SAID AND PAUSED I MAY KISS HER
DID I SAY WE COULD DEPEND UPON NO BETTER MAN TELL HER TO NIGHT WHAT YOU KNOW OF HER DANGER AS INVOLVING HER CHILD AND HER FATHER DWELL UPON THAT FOR SHE WOULD LAY HER OWN FAIR HEAD BESIDE HER HUSBAND'S CHEERFULLY
AND THAT SUMMONS TO ANSWER FOR THOSE THINGS DESCENDS TO ME ASK HIM IS THAT SO IT IS SO ASSENTED DEFARGE ONCE MORE THEN TELL WIND AND FIRE WHERE TO STOP RETURNED MADAME BUT DON'T TELL ME
ALONG WITH TWO OF THE FOUR MEN WHO HAD TAKEN HIM LAST NIGHT AND BARSAD THE PEOPLE HAD ALL POURED OUT TO THE SHOW IN THE STREETS BARSAD PROPOSED TO THE REST LET HER EMBRACE HIM THEN IT IS BUT A MOMENT
MISTER LORRY HELD IT OPEN IN HIS HAND GAZING IN HIS EARNEST FACE KEEP IT FOR ME UNTIL TO MORROW I SHALL SEE HIM TO MORROW YOU REMEMBER AND I HAD BETTER NOT TAKE IT INTO THE PRISON WHY NOT I DON'T KNOW I PREFER NOT TO DO SO
A MOMENT LET ME SPEAK OF IT IN ITS PLACE FIRST HE PUT HIS HAND IN HIS COAT AND TOOK ANOTHER PAPER FROM IT THAT IS THE CERTIFICATE WHICH ENABLES ME TO PASS OUT OF THIS CITY LOOK AT IT YOU SEE SYDNEY CARTON AN ENGLISHMAN
THEN BOIL IT IN A QUART OF NEW MILK STRAIN IT AND SWEETEN IT TO YOUR TASTE SEASON AS YOU PREFER WITH ROSE WATER CINNAMON OR VANILLA
OR ALL OF THESE MEN WERE DISPOSED TO SPARE HIM WHICH IS A LARGE SUPPOSITION FOR WHAT IS HIS LIFE OR ANY MAN'S TO THEM I DOUBT IF THEY DURST SPARE HIM AFTER THE DEMONSTRATION IN THE COURT AND SO DO I I HEARD THE FALL OF THE AXE IN THAT SOUND
AND I WILL GO TO OTHERS WHOM IT IS BETTER NOT TO NAME I WILL WRITE TOO AND BUT STAY THERE IS A CELEBRATION IN THE STREETS AND NO ONE WILL BE ACCESSIBLE UNTIL DARK
TO SO UNHAPPY A BEGINNING BE COMFORTED AND FORGIVE ME HEAVEN BLESS YOU AS HE WAS DRAWN AWAY HIS WIFE RELEASED HIM AND STOOD LOOKING AFTER HIM WITH HER HANDS TOUCHING ONE ANOTHER IN THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER
WHEN HE HAD REVEALED HIS OWN DESOLATE HEART TO IT OUTWATCHED THE AWFUL NIGHT HE ENTERED THE COURTYARD AND REMAINED THERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS ALONE LOOKING UP AT THE LIGHT IN THE WINDOW OF HER ROOM BEFORE HE WENT AWAY HE BREATHED A BLESSING TOWARDS IT
DON'T SUFFER FOR ME A PARTING BLESSING FOR OUR CHILD I SEND IT TO HER BY YOU I KISS HER BY YOU I SAY FAREWELL TO HER BY YOU MY HUSBAND NO A MOMENT HE WAS TEARING HIMSELF APART FROM HER
CARTON TOOK IT UP AND THERE WAS A FOLDED PAPER IN IT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THIS HE SAID MISTER LORRY NODDED HIS CONSENT HE OPENED IT AND EXCLAIMED THANK GOD WHAT IS IT ASKED MISTER LORRY EAGERLY
MISTER LORRY SAW HIM SHRINK INTO THE EXACT FIGURE THAT DEFARGE HAD HAD IN KEEPING AFFECTED AND IMPRESSED WITH TERROR AS THEY BOTH WERE BY THIS SPECTACLE OF RUIN IT WAS NOT A TIME TO YIELD TO SUCH EMOTIONS
HE HAD BEEN MORE THAN FIVE HOURS GONE WHERE COULD HE BE MISTER LORRY WAITED UNTIL TEN BUT DOCTOR MANETTE NOT RETURNING AND HE BEING UNWILLING TO LEAVE LUCIE ANY LONGER IT WAS ARRANGED THAT HE SHOULD GO BACK TO HER AND COME TO THE BANKING HOUSE AGAIN AT MIDNIGHT
IT WILL BE DARK SOON AFTER FOUR LET US STRETCH THE HOUR OR TWO IF I GO TO MISTER LORRY'S AT NINE SHALL I HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE EITHER FROM OUR FRIEND OR FROM YOURSELF YES MAY YOU PROSPER MISTER LORRY
IT WAS SILENTLY ACQUIESCED IN AND THEY PASSED HER OVER THE SEATS IN THE HALL TO A RAISED PLACE WHERE HE BY LEANING OVER THE DOCK COULD FOLD HER IN HIS ARMS FAREWELL DEAR DARLING OF MY SOUL
AND AGAIN WE FACED EACH OTHER HE WAS SOON JOINED BY A QUARTET OF OFFICERS AND WITH MY BACK AGAINST A GOLDEN THRONE I FOUGHT ONCE AGAIN FOR DEJAH THORIS I WAS HARD PRESSED TO DEFEND MYSELF
I WAS STANDING NEAR THE WINDOW AND I KNEW THAT ONCE IN THE STREET I MIGHT GAIN THE PLAZA AND SAFETY BEFORE THE CREATURE COULD OVERTAKE ME AT LEAST THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
BLOWING A HOLE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WOOD AND MASONRY I THEN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE FEARSOME LOOKING THING AND RAISING IT TO ITS FEET MOTIONED FOR IT TO FOLLOW ME
BACK AND FORTH UPON THE FLOOR THEY ROLLED NEITHER ONE EMITTING A SOUND OF FEAR OR PAIN PRESENTLY I SAW THE GREAT EYES OF MY BEAST BULGING COMPLETELY FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND BLOOD FLOWING FROM ITS NOSTRILS
BAR COMAS HAD MUCH THE BETTER OF THE BATTLE AS HE WAS STRONGER QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IT SOON SEEMED THAT THE ENCOUNTER WAS DONE SAVING ONLY THE FINAL DEATH THRUST WHEN BAR COMAS SLIPPED IN
ALTHOUGH I AT FIRST BOMBARDED HIM WITH QUESTIONS FINALLY ALL THE HATRED AND MANIACAL LOATHING FOR THESE AWFUL CREATURES WHO HAD PLACED ME IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE WAS CENTERED BY MY TOTTERING REASON UPON THIS SINGLE EMISSARY
BAR COMAS WAS STONE DEAD AND ONLY THE MOST HERCULEAN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF DAK KOVA'S FEMALES SAVED HIM FROM THE FATE HE DESERVED THREE DAYS LATER HE WALKED WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO THE BODY OF BAR COMAS WHICH
AND WITH HIM MY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE WOMAN I LOVED MY BLADE WAS SWINGING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AS I SOUGHT TO PARRY THE THRUSTS AND CUTS OF MY OPPONENTS TWO I HAD DISARMED AND ONE WAS DOWN
BEFORE THE PLEA WERE MADE SHE REPLIED RISING AND PLACING HER DEAR HANDS UPON MY SHOULDERS AND SO I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER AND THUS IN THE MIDST OF A CITY OF WILD CONFLICT FILLED WITH THE ALARMS OF WAR
CAN IT BE THAT ALL EARTH MEN ARE AS YOU ALONE A STRANGER HUNTED THREATENED PERSECUTED YOU HAVE DONE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS WHAT IN ALL THE PAST AGES OF BARSOOM NO MAN HAS EVER DONE
BREAKING AWAY FROM A CLINCH IT WAS THE ONE LITTLE OPENING THAT DAK KOVA NEEDED AND HURLING HIMSELF AT THE BODY OF HIS ADVERSARY
WITH DIRE FOREBODINGS I AM EVER WILLING TO STAND AND FIGHT WHEN THE ODDS ARE NOT TOO OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST ME BUT IN THIS INSTANCE I PERCEIVED NEITHER GLORY NOR PROFIT
WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHAINED IN WARHOON IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
AND WITH A LAST POWERFUL EFFORT RIPPED THE YOUNG JEDDAK WIDE OPEN THE FULL LENGTH OF HIS BODY THE GREAT TUSK
STRENGTH AND COURAGE SOLA WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED THE SEARCHING PARTY OF HER OWN VOLITION WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE MARTIANS WHOSE FACE HAD NOT BEEN TWISTED IN LAUGHTER AS I BATTLED FOR MY LIFE SHE ON THE CONTRARY
BUT THAT YOU ARE YOU IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME DOUBT MY SANITY AS I ASK YOU MY PRINCESS TO BE MINE HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ABASHED WHO SO WELL KNEW THE ANSWER TO HIS PLEA
I WAITED HIS COMING CROUCHING LIKE SOME BEAST OF PREY AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE MY FOOD UPON THE GROUND I SWUNG THE CHAIN ABOVE MY HEAD AND CRASHED THE LINKS WITH ALL MY STRENGTH UPON HIS SKULL WITHOUT A SOUND
LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK
FEARLESS CONTEMPT AND HATE AND THEN WITHOUT DRAWING A WEAPON AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE HURLED HIMSELF AT THE THROAT OF HIS DEFAMER
WHEN I SAW TARS TARKAS SURGING THROUGH THE CROWD OF PYGMIES THAT SWARMED ABOUT HIM WITH ONE SWING OF HIS MIGHTY LONGSWORD HE LAID A DOZEN CORPSES AT HIS FEET
AS HE HAD IN MINE WITHOUT MORE ADO THEREFORE I TURNED TO MEET THE CHARGE OF THE INFURIATED BULL APE HE WAS NOW TOO CLOSE UPON ME FOR THE CUDGEL TO PROVE OF ANY EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE
RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
EVIL LOOKING PISTOL FROM ITS HOLSTER AND WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CREATURE WHEN I SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK UP HIS ARM THE BULLET STRIKING THE WOODEN CASING OF THE WINDOW EXPLODED
I SEIZED THE CUDGEL WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE BATTLE AND SWINGING IT WITH ALL THE POWER OF MY EARTHLY ARMS I CRASHED IT FULL UPON THE HEAD OF THE APE CRUSHING HIS SKULL AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN EGGSHELL
BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
SO I MERELY THREW IT AS HEAVILY AS I COULD AT HIS ADVANCING BULK IT STRUCK HIM JUST BELOW THE KNEES ELICITING A HOWL OF PAIN AND RAGE AND SO THROWING HIM OFF HIS BALANCE THAT HE LUNGED FULL UPON ME
FOR I AM FREE AND MORE STILL I HAVE TO SAY ERE IT IS AGAIN TOO LATE I RETURNED I HAVE DONE MANY STRANGE THINGS IN MY LIFE MANY THINGS THAT WISER MEN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED
AND TURNED TO FOLLOW US FROM THE ROOM THERE SEEMED SOMETHING MENACING IN THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD MY BEAST AND I HESITATED TO LEAVE UNTIL I HAD LEARNED THE OUTCOME IT WAS WELL I DID SO FOR THE WARRIOR DREW AN
AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
EVEN SHOULD I BREAK ONE OF THEM WITH MY FIRST BLOW FOR I FIGURED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO WARD OFF THE CUDGEL HE COULD REACH OUT AND ANNIHILATE ME WITH THE OTHERS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FOR A SECOND ATTACK
WITH DRAWN LONG SWORD IN AN INSTANT WE WERE ENGAGED AND I FOUND NO MEAN ANTAGONIST AS WE CIRCLED UPON THE BROAD PLATFORM I SAW SAB THAN RUSHING UP THE STEPS TO AID HIS FATHER
AND TARS TARKAS HASTENED AWAY TO DIRECT THE FIGHTING WITHOUT KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
WITH ARMS WIDE STRETCHED TO EASE HIS FALL AGAIN AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY I HAD RECOURSE TO EARTHLY TACTICS AND SWINGING MY RIGHT FIST FULL UPON THE POINT OF HIS CHIN
I NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN TWO GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS BATTLE WITH NATURE'S WEAPONS AND THE EXHIBITION OF ANIMAL FEROCITY WHICH ENSUED WAS AS FEARFUL A THING AS THE MOST DISORDERED IMAGINATION COULD PICTURE
AND TAKING MY HAND STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER TARS TARKAS AND THE OTHER WARRIORS HAD ENTERED AND WERE STANDING OVER THE NOW RAPIDLY REVIVING BRUTE WHICH HAD SAVED MY LIFE
FOR IT WAS SAB THAN PRINCE OF ZODANGA WHO STOOD REVEALED BEFORE ME THAN KOSIS NOW TOOK A SET OF THE ORNAMENTS FROM ONE OF THE SALVERS AND PLACED ONE OF THE COLLARS OF GOLD ABOUT HIS SON'S NECK
AGAINST THE IRON MUSCLES AND BRUTAL FEROCITY OF THIS ENRAGED DENIZEN OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD IN FACT THE ONLY OUTCOME OF SUCH AN ENCOUNTER SO FAR AS I MIGHT BE CONCERNED SEEMED SUDDEN DEATH
AND BENDING OVER ME WAS AN ANCIENT AND UGLY FEMALE AS I OPENED MY EYES SHE TURNED TO ONE OF THE WARRIORS SAYING HE WILL LIVE O JED TIS WELL REPLIED THE ONE SO ADDRESSED
THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
AND THAT MY MIND DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE TERRORS OF THAT INKY BLACKNESS HAS BEEN A WONDER TO ME EVER SINCE THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH CREEPING CRAWLING THINGS COLD SINUOUS BODIES PASSED OVER ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR UPPER AND LOWER LIMBS THEIR EYES WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND NON PROTRUDING THEIR EARS WERE HIGH SET BUT MORE LATERALLY LOCATED THAN THOSE OF THE MARTIANS
FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS
WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
SCARCELY HAD THE BLOW DESCENDED WHEN I WAS CONFRONTED WITH A NEW DANGER THE APE'S MATE RECOVERED FROM ITS FIRST SHOCK OF TERROR HAD RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF THE ENCOUNTER BY WAY OF THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING
THE INJURIES TO DAK KOVA HAD DELAYED THE MARCH SO GREATLY THAT IT WAS DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHICH WAS A RAID UPON A SMALL THARK COMMUNITY IN RETALIATION FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INCUBATOR UNTIL AFTER THE GREAT GAMES
WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
THEY SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN ARGUMENT AND FINALLY ONE OF THEM ADDRESSED ME BUT REMEMBERING MY IGNORANCE OF HIS LANGUAGE TURNED BACK TO TARS TARKAS WHO WITH A WORD AND GESTURE GAVE SOME COMMAND TO THE FELLOW
BACK INTO MY CORNER I CROUCHED
WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN STRIKE HER DOWN IT IS HER PLOT KILL HER KILL HER
THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
BACKED BY MUSCLES FAR TRANSCENDING THOSE OF THE MARTIAN MEN I HAD SEEN HAD LOCKED THE THROAT OF MY GUARDIAN AND SLOWLY WERE CHOKING OUT HIS LIFE AND BENDING BACK HIS HEAD AND NECK UPON HIS BODY
BATTLE AS IT IS VOUCHSAFED FEW BEINGS TO SEE THE STRENGTH AGILITY AND BLIND FEROCITY OF THESE TWO CREATURES IS APPROACHED BY NOTHING KNOWN TO EARTHLY MAN
DEATH STRUGGLE WITH MY PRESERVER WHICH WAS NOTHING LESS THAN MY FAITHFUL WATCH THING I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO CALL SO HIDEOUS A CREATURE A DOG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I GAINED MY FEET AND BACKING AGAINST THE WALL I WITNESSED SUCH A
WHILE IT JABBERED AND GESTICULATED AT SOME ANSWERING CREATURE BEHIND ME THIS OTHER WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY ITS MATE SOON CAME TOWARD US BEARING A MIGHTY STONE CUDGEL
HIS GREAT EYES FASTENED UPON ME IN WHAT SEEMED A PITIFUL APPEAL FOR PROTECTION I COULD NOT WITHSTAND THAT LOOK NOR COULD I ON SECOND THOUGHT HAVE DESERTED MY RESCUER WITHOUT GIVING AS GOOD AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF IN HIS BEHALF
VICTOR AND VANQUISHED ROLLED LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE MOSS A HUGE MASS OF TORN AND BLOODY FLESH
AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WAS FOR KANTOS KAN
HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
I HAVE BROUGHT A STRANGE CREATURE WEARING THE METAL OF A THARK WHOM IT IS MY PLEASURE TO HAVE BATTLE WITH A WILD THOAT AT THE GREAT GAMES HE WILL DIE AS BAR COMAS YOUR JEDDAK SEES FIT IF AT ALL
WHEN A BOLT OF MYRIAD LEGGED HORROR HURLED ITSELF THROUGH THE DOORWAY FULL UPON THE BREAST OF MY EXECUTIONER WITH A SHRIEK OF FEAR THE APE WHICH HELD ME LEAPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW BUT ITS MATE CLOSED IN A TERRIFIC
HE ENTIRELY OMITTED THE USUAL FORMAL SALUTATION AS WE ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THE JEDDAK AND AS HE PUSHED ME ROUGHLY BEFORE THE RULER HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD AND MENACING VOICE
WHICH I NEGOTIATED EASILY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE ONCE INSIDE HOWEVER THE GATE GAVE ME CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
BUT SO ALSO WAS THE APE WHOSE STRUGGLES WERE GROWING MOMENTARILY LESS SUDDENLY I CAME TO MYSELF
AGAINST ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH SHOULD I REMAIN AND FIGHT HOWEVER DESPERATELY IT IS TRUE I HELD THE CUDGEL BUT WHAT COULD I DO WITH IT AGAINST HIS FOUR GREAT ARMS
WHICH SEEMED TO MARK ALL THE GREATER WARRIORS AMONG THE WARHOONS AS WELL AS TO INDICATE THEIR AWFUL FEROCITY WHICH GREATLY TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT OF THE THARKS THE JEDDAK BAR COMAS WHO WAS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG
WHO PROVED TO BE THE JEDDAK OF THE HORDES OF WARHOON LIKE THE JED WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY SCARRED AND ALSO DECORATED WITH THE BREASTPLATE OF HUMAN SKULLS AND DRIED DEAD HANDS
AND SOON MY FIERCE ESCORT WAS RIDING ACROSS THE GARDENS OF THE JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS WE APPROACHED THE PALACE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO THE BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THAN KOSIS
SO WITH THE CUNNING OF A MADMAN I BACKED INTO THE FAR CORNER OF MY CELL WHEN NEXT I HEARD HIM APPROACHING
I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
HE WAS A HUGE FELLOW TERRIBLY SCARRED ABOUT THE FACE AND CHEST AND WITH ONE BROKEN TUSK AND A MISSING EAR
WHERE I MOMENTARILY EXPECTED THE FORMER TO FALL LIMP AT THE END OF A BROKEN NECK IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS THE APE WAS TEARING AWAY THE ENTIRE FRONT OF ITS BREAST WHICH WAS HELD IN THE VISE LIKE GRIP OF THE POWERFUL JAWS
AND SO I CAME CLOSE AND PEERED WITHIN AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS SAT THAN KOSIS AND HIS CONSORT
AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY AND FINALLY
MY ABSENCE HAD BEEN NOTED BY SOLA ON HER AWAKENING AND SHE HAD QUICKLY INFORMED TARS TARKAS WHO HAD SET OUT IMMEDIATELY WITH A HANDFUL OF WARRIORS TO SEARCH FOR ME AS THEY HAD APPROACHED THE LIMITS OF THE CITY
BY CUSTOM HAD NOT BEEN MOVED FROM WHERE IT FELL AND PLACING HIS FOOT UPON THE NECK OF HIS ERSTWHILE RULER HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF JEDDAK OF WARHOON
LOVE OR AFFECTION THESE PEOPLE FAIRLY WORSHIP PHYSICAL PROWESS AND BRAVERY AND NOTHING IS TOO GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADORATION AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS POSITION BY REPEATED EXAMPLES OF HIS SKILL
RATHER THAN BY A WATER HEARTED WEAKLING FROM WHOM EVEN OLD DAK KOVA COULD TEAR THE METAL WITH HIS BARE HANDS BAR COMAS EYED THE DEFIANT AND INSUBORDINATE CHIEFTAIN FOR AN INSTANT HIS EXPRESSION ONE OF HAUGHTY
THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
WITH WHICH IT EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO BRAIN ME THE CREATURES WERE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET TALL STANDING ERECT AND HAD LIKE THE GREEN MARTIANS AN INTERMEDIARY SET OF ARMS OR LEGS
SO THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN SAB THAN WE DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE TO ATTEMPT TO CUT AWAY THE BARS AND CHAINS WHICH HELD HIM PRISONER SO AT HIS SUGGESTION
CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES FOR GAINING A POSITION
HELD IN ITS POOR UGLY CARCASS MORE LOVE MORE LOYALTY MORE GRATITUDE
FOOD WAS BROUGHT ME AT INTERVALS BUT OWING TO THE UTTER DARKNESS OF THE PLACE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I LAY THERE DAYS OR WEEKS OR MONTHS IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF ALL MY LIFE
I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER
WAS SOBER WITH APPARENT SOLICITUDE AND AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THE MONSTER RUSHED TO ME AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED MY BODY FOR POSSIBLE WOUNDS OR INJURIES SATISFYING HERSELF THAT I HAD COME OFF UNSCATHED SHE SMILED QUIETLY
BUT AS HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE DEJAH THORIS SPRANG BEFORE HIM AND THEN MY SWORD FOUND THE SPOT THAT MADE SAB THAN JEDDAK OF ZODANGA
I BEHELD TARS TARKAS SOLA AND THREE OR FOUR WARRIORS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE CHAMBER AS MY EYES MET THEIRS I WAS FOR THE SECOND TIME THE RECIPIENT OF THEIR ZEALOUSLY GUARDED APPLAUSE
I GLIMPSED HIM JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE DOORWAY AND THE SIGHT OF HIM NOW ROARING AS HE PERCEIVED HIS LIFELESS FELLOW STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS RAGE FILLED ME I MUST CONFESS
AND STEALTHILY ON CAME THE AWFUL EYES UNTIL THEY REACHED THE DEAD BODY AT MY FEET THEN SLOWLY THEY RETREATED BUT THIS TIME WITH A STRANGE GRATING SOUND
AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS WITH THE FEMALE DURING WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOW FULLY FIT TO TRAVEL THE JED ORDERED THAT WE MOUNT AND RIDE AFTER THE MAIN COLUMN
HE SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR STONE DEAD LAUGHING AND CHATTERING LIKE THE IDIOT I WAS FAST BECOMING
AND SOLA GRASPING ME TIGHTLY BY THE ARM I HAD AT LEAST TWO FRIENDS ON MARS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WATCHED OVER ME WITH MOTHERLY SOLICITUDE AND A DUMB BRUTE WHICH AS I LATER CAME TO KNOW
TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
THIS ENCOUNTER TOGETHER WITH MY SET TO WITH THE MARTIAN WARRIOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND MY FEATS OF JUMPING PLACED ME UPON A HIGH PINNACLE IN THEIR REGARD EVIDENTLY DEVOID OF ALL THE FINER SENTIMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP
I WAS STRAPPED SECURELY TO AS WILD AND UNMANAGEABLE A THOAT AS I HAD EVER SEEN AND WITH A MOUNTED WARRIOR ON EITHER SIDE TO PREVENT THE BEAST FROM BOLTING
THEY ARE A SMALLER HORDE THAN THE THARKS BUT MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS
WE RODE FORTH AT A FURIOUS PACE IN PURSUIT OF THE COLUMN MY WOUNDS GAVE ME BUT LITTLE PAIN SO WONDERFULLY AND RAPIDLY HAD THE APPLICATIONS AND INJECTIONS OF THE FEMALE EXERCISED THEIR THERAPEUTIC POWERS
SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
AND DEPENDING FROM THESE A NUMBER OF DRIED HUMAN HANDS HIS REFERENCE TO THE GREAT GAMES OF WHICH I HAD HEARD SO MUCH WHILE AMONG THE THARKS CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD BUT JUMPED FROM PURGATORY INTO GEHENNA
WHO REPRESENTED TO ME THE ENTIRE HORDE OF WARHOONS I HAD NOTICED THAT HE ALWAYS ADVANCED WITH HIS DIM TORCH TO WHERE HE COULD PLACE THE FOOD WITHIN MY REACH AND AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE IT UPON THE FLOOR
AND LEAVING DEJAH THORIS IN CHARGE OF TARS TARKAS I TOOK A DOZEN WARRIORS AND HASTENED TO THE DUNGEONS BENEATH THE PALACE THE JAILERS HAD ALL LEFT TO JOIN THE FIGHTERS IN THE THRONE ROOM SO WE SEARCHED THE LABYRINTHINE PRISON WITHOUT OPPOSITION
A FIGHT THAT WON FRIENDS THE THING WHICH MORE NEARLY RESEMBLED OUR EARTHLY MEN THAN IT DID THE MARTIANS I HAD SEEN HELD ME PINIONED TO THE GROUND WITH ONE HUGE FOOT
MY BEAST HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS FIRST HOLD HAVING SUNK HIS MIGHTY FANGS FAR INTO THE BREAST OF HIS ADVERSARY BUT THE GREAT ARMS AND PAWS OF THE APE
IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
NO LONGER WAS I A JIBBERING IDIOT BUT A SANE REASONING MAN WITH THE MEANS OF ESCAPE WITHIN MY VERY HANDS AS I WAS GROPING TO REMOVE THE CHAIN FROM ABOUT MY VICTIM'S NECK
BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST FANCIES HAVE I DREAMED OF WINNING A DEJAH THORIS FOR MYSELF FOR NEVER HAD I DREAMED THAT IN ALL THE UNIVERSE DWELT SUCH A WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM
AND TRY TO GET UP BETTER CHILDREN IN THE MORNING NOW THEN DON'T LET ME HAVE TO TELL YOU TWICE IF I FIND ANY OF YOU NOT IN BED IN TEN MINUTES
THE MOAT AND THE TENTS
IT IS TRUE THAT DIRECTLY HE BIT A PIECE OFF THE REST VANISHED
I SAY THERE ARE LOTS OF STONES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COURTYARD IF WE TOOK SOME OF THOSE UP JUST TO DROP ON THEIR HEADS
WOULDN'T YOU SAID ROBERT YOU SEE
I'D GIVE SOMETHING FOR A JOLLY GOOD BOILING KETTLE OF LEAD
THIS IS THE VERY FIRST THING WE'VE WISHED FOR THAT HASN'T GOT US INTO A ROW AND THERE HASN'T BEEN THE LEAST LITTLE SCRAP OF A ROW ABOUT THIS NOBODY'S RAGING DOWNSTAIRS WE'RE SAFE AND SOUND
THE NEXT MOMENT ALL THE OTHERS WERE FOLLOWING HIS EXAMPLE AND OPENING AND SHUTTING THEIR MOUTHS AN INCH OR SO FROM THE BARE LOOKING TABLE ROBERT CAPTURED A
THEN IF WE HAD THE MUTTON IT WOULD BE REAL SAID ROBERT OH DON'T I WISH WE COULD FIND IT BUT WE CAN'T FIND IT I SUPPOSE IT ISN'T OURS TILL WE'VE GOT IT IN OUR MOUTHS
AND COULD SEE TOO THAT BEYOND THE MOAT ON EVERY SIDE THE TENTS OF THE BESIEGING PARTY WERE PITCHED
THE SAME AS OURS IN THE STABLE YARD SAID JANE
THE PUDDING WAS FORTUNATELY
HEAVY FEET AND THE CLANK OF STEEL NO ONE BREATHED FOR A MOMENT THE STEEL
IT IS REAL SAID ROBERT AND THEY ARE GOING TO ATTACK ALL RUSHED TO THE NARROW WINDOWS YES SAID ROBERT
SO A HEAP OF STONES GREW APACE UP IN THE ROOM ABOVE THE GATE AND ANOTHER HEAP A SHINY SPIKY DANGEROUS LOOKING HEAP OF DAGGERS AND KNIVES
IN THE GATE TOWER HERE I THINK I'M GLAD IT'S ONLY A GAME IT IS ONLY A GAME ISN'T IT SAID JANE BUT NO ONE ANSWERED
BISCUITS THREE WHOLE ONES AND A GENEROUS HANDFUL OF CRUMBS AND FRAGMENTS I GOT THEM THIS MORNING COOK AND I'D QUITE FORGOTTEN HE EXPLAINED AS HE DIVIDED THEM WITH SCRUPULOUS FAIRNESS INTO FOUR HEAPS
AND THE TRAMP OF ARMED MEN UP QUICK CRIED ROBERT LET'S DROP THINGS ON THEM EVEN THE GIRLS WERE FEELING ALMOST BRAVE NOW THEY FOLLOWED ROBERT QUICKLY AND UNDER HIS DIRECTIONS
OH DEAR SAID JANE DON'T YOU THINK WE'D BETTER SURRENDER NEVER SAID ROBERT WE'LL HAVE A PARLEY IF YOU LIKE BUT WE'LL NEVER SURRENDER
AND HIS FINGERS WERE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE ROBERT NEVER KNEW HOW THE MAN HAD MANAGED TO CLIMB UP OUT OF THE WATER BUT HE SAW THE CLINGING FINGERS AND HIT THEM AS HARD AS HE COULD WITH AN IRON BAR THAT HE CAUGHT UP FROM THE FLOOR THE MAN FELL
WHY SHOULD IT ASKED ROBERT WATER'S WATER ALL THE WORLD OVER
THE GARRISON WAS WELL PROVISIONED TILL SUNDOWN THEY BROUGHT UP SOME IRON POTS OF COLD WATER TO POUR ON THE BESIEGERS INSTEAD OF HOT LEAD WITH WHICH THE CASTLE DID NOT SEEM TO BE PROVIDED
EATEN WITH WATER FROM THE DEEP WELL IN THE COURTYARD DRUNK OUT OF HORNS
THEN ROBERT SPRANG SOFTLY TO THE DOOR HE PULLED OFF HIS SHOES
THEY LOOKED AT ROBERT WITH SURPRISED RESPECT ANTHEA SAID YOU REALLY ARE BRAVE ROBERT ROT CYRIL'S PALLOR TURNED TO REDNESS NOW ALL IN A MINUTE
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY AT BESIEGED CASTLES
A SIEGE AND BED THE CHILDREN WERE SITTING IN THE GLOOMY BANQUETING HALL AT THE END OF ONE OF THE LONG BARE WOODEN TABLES THERE WAS NOW NO HOPE
AND JANE TOOK A VERY LITTLE COURAGE AS SHE REMEMBERED THAT SUNSET COULDN'T BE FAR OFF NOW THE MOAT IS DREADFULLY THIN SAID ANTHEA BUT THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE CASTLE EVEN IF THEY DO SWIM OVER
NO BAWLED ROBERT OF COURSE WE DON'T NEVER
YOU CAN'T HELP IT IF YOU ARE POURING WATER ON A BESIEGING FOE AND YOUR CASTLE SUDDENLY CHANGES INTO YOUR HOUSE
BECAUSE HE KNEW THIS WAS FOR A BATTERING RAM WHAT A GOOD THING WE'VE GOT A MOAT HE SAID AND WHAT A GOOD THING THE DRAWBRIDGE IS UP I SHOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN HOW TO WORK IT OF COURSE IT WOULD BE UP IN A BESIEGED CASTLE
JUST AS HE WAS PUTTING AWAY THE RESERVE BISCUITS IN A SORT OF LITTLE STONE CUPBOARD WITHOUT A DOOR A SUDDEN SOUND MADE HIM DROP THREE IT WAS THE LOUD FIERCE CRY OF A TRUMPET YOU SEE
YES BUT LOOK HERE SQUIRREL SAID ROBERT YOU'RE SO CLEVER AT EXPLAINING ABOUT INVISIBLENESS AND ALL THAT HOW IS IT THE BISCUITS ARE HERE AND ALL THE BREAD AND MEAT AND THINGS HAVE DISAPPEARED
SHE ADDED HASTILY AND JANE AS WELL AND WE HAVEN'T GOT INTO
AS ANTHEA WAS CROSSING THE COURTYARD FOR MORE STONES A SUDDEN AND VALUABLE IDEA CAME TO HER SHE WENT TO MARTHA AND SAID
WAS GETTING RATHER DARK IN THE ROOM ABOVE THE GREAT
A TRUMPETER CAME FORWARD TO THE EDGE OF THE MOAT WHICH NOW SEEMED VERY MUCH NARROWER THAN AT FIRST
FEW INTREPID SURVIVORS THAT'S US
INTO THE MOAT WATER IN ANOTHER MOMENT ROBERT WAS OUTSIDE THE LITTLE ROOM
AND THE LITTLE ROOM WAS ALMOST QUITE DARK WE'VE HELD IT CRIED ROBERT WE WON'T SURRENDER THE SUN MUST SET IN A MINUTE HERE THEY'RE ALL JAWING UNDERNEATH AGAIN PITY THERE'S NO TIME TO GET MORE STONES HERE POUR THAT WATER DOWN ON THEM
THE FLASH OF PENNONED LANCES THE GLEAM OF ARMOUR
ALL GONE AND THERE WAS THE GARDEN WITH ITS TANGLE OF DAHLIAS AND MARIGOLDS AND ASTERS AND LATE ROSES AND THE SPIKY IRON RAILINGS AND THE QUIET WHITE ROAD EVERYONE
WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN DEGRADING FOR SIR WULFRIC DE TALBOT SAID JANE DREAMILY IF HE COULD HAVE KNOWN THAT HALF THE BESIEGED GARRISON WORE PINAFORES
ANYONE SHOULD FEEL FAINT IN STRESS OF BATTLE
BIG FRONT BEDROOM OF THEIR OWN HOUSE
IT WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER THERE WAS A CREAKING ABOVE AND SOMETHING RATTLED AND SHOOK THE PAVEMENT THEY STOOD ON SEEMED TO TREMBLE THEN A CRASH TOLD THEM THAT THE DRAWBRIDGE HAD BEEN LOWERED TO ITS PLACE
CLEANING OR SHARPENING THEIR ARMS RE STRINGING THEIR BOWS AND POLISHING THEIR SHIELDS A LARGE PARTY CAME ALONG THE ROAD WITH HORSES DRAGGING ALONG THE GREAT TRUNK OF A TREE AND CYRIL FELT QUITE PALE
THE MAN ANSWERED BACK
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL AND TAKING THE POT FROM ANTHEA POURED THE WATER OUT THROUGH THE ARROW SLIT AND AS HE BEGAN TO POUR THE NOISE OF THE BATTERING RAM AND THE TRAMPLING OF THE FOE AND THE SHOUTS OF
PAINFUL SCENE IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THEY ALL HAD ENOUGH MUTTON AND THAT WHEN MARTHA CAME TO CHANGE THE PLATES SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A MESS IN ALL HER BORN DAYS
THEY KNEW BUT TOO WELL THAT FOR THEM THERE WAS NOTHING THERE BUT TABLE SUDDENLY CYRIL FELT IN HIS POCKET
FOR NOBODY LOOKS NICE PICKING UP SLICES OF SUET PUDDING FROM THE TABLE IN ITS MOUTH LIKE A DOG THE GREAT THING AFTER ALL
AND TURNED THE GREAT KEY IN THE LOCK JUST AS JAKIN SPRANG TO THE INSIDE OF THE DOOR
AS CYRIL SAID ARMED HEAVILY FOR THESE SWORDS AND LANCES AND CROSSBOWS WERE FAR TOO WEIGHTY EVEN FOR CYRIL'S MANLY STRENGTH AND AS FOR THE LONGBOWS NONE OF THE CHILDREN COULD EVEN BEGIN TO BEND THEM THE DAGGERS WERE BETTER
OF COURSE THEY ARE ANTHEA POINTED CHEERFULLY THROUGH THE NARROW WINDOW
IT'S NO GOOD SAID ROBERT IN DEEP DEJECTION YOU'LL ONLY HULLO CYRIL STOOD UP WITH A GRIN OF TRIUMPH HOLDING A SQUARE PIECE OF BREAD IN HIS MOUTH IT WAS QUITE REAL EVERYONE SAW IT
HULLO THERE ROBERT BELLOWED BACK AT ONCE IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD THE KING AND OF OUR GOOD LORD AND TRUSTY LEADER SIR WULFRIC DE TALBOT WE SUMMON THIS CASTLE TO SURRENDER ON PAIN OF FIRE AND SWORD AND NO QUARTER
AND ALL THE PROVISIONS EATEN AND NOW
I'M JOLLY HUNGRY GOOD NIGHT KIDS GOOD NIGHT I HOPE THE CASTLE WON'T COME CREEPING BACK IN THE NIGHT SAID JANE OF COURSE IT WON'T SAID ANTHEA BRISKLY
THEY USED TO POUR BOILING LEAD DOWN ON BESIEGERS WHEN THEY GOT TOO CLOSE SAID ANTHEA FATHER SHOWED ME THE HOLES ON PURPOSE FOR POURING IT DOWN THROUGH AT BODIAM CASTLE AND THERE ARE HOLES LIKE IT
WITH A SINGLE GROWN UP THE DOOR WAS OPENED SUDDENLY AND FIERCELY YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES SAID THE VOICE OF MARTHA
I DON'T KNOW SAID CYRIL AFTER A PAUSE UNLESS IT'S BECAUSE WE HAD THEM
AND CALLING TO CYRIL TO LEND A HAND THEN THEY STOOD IN THE ARCHED GATE HOUSE BREATHING HARD AND LOOKING AT EACH OTHER JANE'S MOUTH WAS OPEN CHEER UP JENNY SAID ROBERT
PUT MINE IN MY POCKET PLEASE MY HANDS ARE SO DIRTY AND I'LL TELL THE OTHERS TO FETCH THEIRS THIS WAS INDEED A HAPPY THOUGHT FOR NOW WITH FOUR GENEROUS HANDFULS OF AIR WHICH TURNED TO BISCUIT AS MARTHA CRAMMED IT INTO THEIR POCKETS
JANE PLEADED I DON'T BELIEVE THE SUN'S GOING TO SET TO NIGHT AT ALL
IT ISN'T ROBERT WAS BEGINNING STERNLY BUT ANTHEA INTERRUPTED OH YES YOU DO SHE SAID COAXINGLY IT'S A VERY NICE GAME REALLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY GET IN AND IF THEY DO
SO ANTHEA TILTED THE POT OVER THE NEAREST LEAD HOLE AND POURED THEY HEARD A SPLASH BELOW
I THOUGHT WE COULDN'T GET THROUGH A WISH DAY WITHOUT A ROW SAID CYRIL IT WAS MUCH TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE COME ON BOBS MY MILITARY HERO IF WE LICK INTO BED SHARP SHE WON'T BE SO FRUMIOUS AND PERHAPS SHE'LL BONG US UP SOME SUPPER
AND NOW EVERYONE FELT MORE COURAGE TO PREPARE FOR THE ATTACK THAT WAS TO BE DELIVERED BEFORE SUNSET ROBERT AS CAPTAIN INSISTED ON CLIMBING TO THE TOP OF ONE OF THE TOWERS TO RECONNOITRE SO UP THEY ALL WENT
OH I SAY CYRIL WAS BEGINNING BUT ANTHEA STOPPED HIM
DEFENDING TO THE DEATH I MEAN ASKED ANTHEA WE OUGHT TO BE HEAVILY ARMED AND THEN SHOOT AT THEM WHEN THEY ADVANCE TO THE ATTACK
AND DE TALBOT FOR EVER ALL SUDDENLY STOPPED AND WENT OUT LIKE THE SNUFF OF A CANDLE THE LITTLE DARK ROOM SEEMED TO WHIRL ROUND AND TURN TOPSY TURVY AND WHEN THE CHILDREN CAME TO THEMSELVES
LYING FLAT ON THE FLOOR AND PUTTING ONE EYE TO THE LEAD HOLE OF COURSE THE HOLES GO STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE GATE HOUSE THAT'S FOR WHEN THE ENEMY HAS GOT PAST THE DOOR AND THE PORTCULLIS AND ALMOST ALL IS LOST HERE HAND ME THE POT
JUST PLAIN PLEASE THEY SAID MARTHA SAID WELL I NEVER WHAT NEXT I WONDER AND WENT AWAY THEN ENSUED ANOTHER SCENE ON WHICH I WILL NOT DWELL
A NEW CAP AND EVERYTHING SHE FLOUNCED OUT AMID A DISREGARDED CHORUS OF REGRETS AND APOLOGIES THE CHILDREN WERE VERY SORRY BUT REALLY IT WAS NOT THEIR FAULTS
ON THE GREY HORSE JANE CONSENTED TO LOOK AND THE SCENE WAS ALMOST TOO PRETTY TO BE ALARMING
THERE WAS A CONFUSED NOISE BELOW AND SOME GROANS OH DEAR
MARTHA HAD BROUGHT IN THE DINNER AND THE DINNER WAS INVISIBLE AND UNFEELABLE TOO
WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHICH OF YOU IS THE BRAVEST I THINK CYRIL WAS A PERFECT SILLY TO WISH FOR A CASTLE
I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T LAST THROUGH THE DAY WITHOUT GETTING UP TO SOME DOGGERY A PERSON CAN'T TAKE A BREATH OF AIR ON THE FRONT DOORSTEP BUT YOU MUST BE EMPTYING THE WASH HAND JUG ON TO THEIR HEADS OFF YOU GO TO BED THE LOT OF YOU
THINKING OF THE BISCUITS WHO PUTS MUTTON IN THEIR POCKETS GOOSE GIRL SAID CYRIL BUT I KNOW AT ANY RATE I'LL TRY IT HE LEANED OVER THE TABLE WITH HIS FACE ABOUT AN
BUT JANE HOPED THAT THE BESIEGERS WOULD NOT COME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR DAGGERS TO BE OF ANY USE NEVER MIND WE CAN HURL THEM LIKE JAVELINS SAID CYRIL OR DROP THEM ON PEOPLE'S HEADS
DREW A DEEP BREATH AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID ROBERT I TOLD YOU SO AND I SAY WE DIDN'T SURRENDER DID WE
THAT'S THAT BEAST JAKIN SAID ROBERT THERE'S STILL THE PORTCULLIS I'M ALMOST CERTAIN THAT'S WORKED FROM LOWER DOWN AND NOW THE DRAWBRIDGE RANG AND ECHOED HOLLOWLY TO THE HOOFS OF HORSES
THEY WERE EATEN IN A HAPPY SILENCE THOUGH THEY TASTED A LITTLE ODDLY
HE PEEPED INTO THE UPPER ROOM THE MAN WAS THERE AND IT WAS JAKIN ALL DRIPPING WITH MOAT WATER AND HE WAS FIDDLING ABOUT WITH THE MACHINERY WHICH ROBERT FELT SURE WORKED THE DRAWBRIDGE ROBERT BANGED THE DOOR SUDDENLY
AND AGAIN THE RAM BATTERED THE GREAT DOOR ANTHEA PAUSED
TO THE OTHERS WHO HAD ONLY SEEN THE CAMP AND THE BESIEGERS FROM A DISTANCE THE WHOLE THING SEEMED HALF A GAME OF MAKE BELIEVE AND HALF A SPLENDIDLY DISTINCT AND PERFECTLY SAFE DREAM
IT WAS JUST LIKE A SPLENDID COLOURED PICTURE THE TRUMPETS WERE SOUNDING AND WHEN THE TRUMPETS STOPPED FOR BREATH
A MAN WHO WAS WITH THE TRUMPETER SHOUTED WHAT HO WITHIN THERE AND
I'M AFRAID WE'VE HURT SOMEBODY ROBERT CAUGHT UP THE STONE IN A FURY I SHOULD
I THINK I AM NOW SAID ANTHEA SLOWLY BUT I WOULDN'T WISH FOR IT AGAIN I THINK SQUIRREL DEAR OH IT WAS SIMPLY SPLENDID SAID JANE UNEXPECTEDLY I WASN'T FRIGHTENED A BIT
SOME SAY THY GRACE IS YOUTH AND GENTLE SPORT BOTH GRACE AND FAULTS ARE LOV'D OF MORE AND LESS
AND THOU AWAY THE VERY BIRDS ARE MUTE OR IF THEY SING TIS WITH SO DULL A CHEER THAT LEAVES LOOK PALE DREADING THE WINTER'S NEAR
HAVE I NOT SEEN DWELLERS ON FORM AND FAVOUR LOSE ALL AND MORE BY PAYING TOO MUCH RENT FOR COMPOUND SWEET FORGOING SIMPLE SAVOUR PITIFUL THRIVERS IN THEIR GAZING SPENT NO
IT FEARS NOT POLICY THAT HERETIC WHICH WORKS ON LEASES OF SHORT NUMBER'D HOURS BUT ALL ALONE STANDS HUGELY POLITIC THAT IT NOR GROWS WITH HEAT NOR DROWNS WITH SHOWERS TO THIS I WITNESS CALL
YET NOR THE LAYS OF BIRDS NOR THE SWEET SMELL OF DIFFERENT FLOWERS IN ODOUR AND IN HUE COULD MAKE ME ANY SUMMER'S STORY TELL OR FROM THEIR PROUD LAP PLUCK THEM WHERE THEY GREW
WHILST MY POOR LIPS WHICH SHOULD THAT HARVEST REAP AT THE WOOD'S BOLDNESS BY THEE BLUSHING STAND TO BE SO TICKLED THEY WOULD CHANGE THEIR STATE AND SITUATION WITH THOSE DANCING CHIPS O'ER WHOM THY FINGERS WALK WITH GENTLE GAIT
TAKE HEED DEAR HEART OF THIS LARGE PRIVILEGE
EXTREME A BLISS IN PROOF
WHAT OLD DECEMBER'S BARENESS EVERYWHERE AND YET THIS TIME REMOVED WAS SUMMER'S TIME THE TEEMING AUTUMN BIG WITH RICH INCREASE BEARING THE WANTON BURDEN OF THE PRIME
THE ROSES FEARFULLY ON THORNS DID STAND ONE BLUSHING SHAME ANOTHER WHITE DESPAIR A THIRD NOR RED NOR WHITE HAD STOL'N OF BOTH AND TO HIS ROBBERY HAD ANNEX'D THY BREATH
ALL THESE I BETTER IN ONE GENERAL BEST THY LOVE IS BETTER THAN HIGH BIRTH TO ME RICHER THAN WEALTH PROUDER THAN GARMENTS COSTS
FOR WHY SHOULD OTHERS FALSE ADULTERATE EYES GIVE SALUTATION TO MY SPORTIVE BLOOD OR ON MY FRAILTIES WHY ARE FRAILER SPIES WHICH IN THEIR WILLS COUNT BAD WHAT I THINK GOOD
WERE'T AUGHT TO ME I BORE THE CANOPY WITH MY EXTERN THE OUTWARD HONOURING OR LAID GREAT BASES FOR ETERNITY WHICH PROVES MORE SHORT THAN WASTE OR RUINING
IF SNOW BE WHITE WHY THEN HER BREASTS ARE DUN IF HAIRS BE WIRES BLACK WIRES GROW ON HER HEAD I HAVE SEEN ROSES DAMASK'D RED AND WHITE
NOR DID I WONDER AT THE LILY'S WHITE NOR PRAISE THE DEEP VERMILION IN THE ROSE THEY WERE BUT SWEET BUT FIGURES OF DELIGHT DRAWN AFTER YOU YOU PATTERN OF ALL THOSE
YET SEEM'D IT WINTER STILL AND YOU AWAY AS WITH YOUR SHADOW I WITH THESE DID PLAY
SING TO THE EAR THAT DOTH THY LAYS ESTEEM AND GIVES THY PEN BOTH SKILL AND ARGUMENT
THE FORWARD VIOLET THUS DID I CHIDE SWEET THIEF WHENCE DIDST THOU STEAL THY SWEET THAT SMELLS IF NOT FROM MY LOVE'S BREATH
BUT FOR HIS THEFT IN PRIDE OF ALL HIS GROWTH A VENGEFUL CANKER EAT HIM UP TO DEATH
BY THEIR RANK THOUGHTS MY DEEDS MUST NOT BE SHOWN UNLESS THIS GENERAL EVIL THEY MAINTAIN ALL MEN ARE BAD AND IN THEIR BADNESS REIGN
WHICH SHALL ABOVE THAT IDLE RANK REMAIN BEYOND ALL DATE EVEN TO ETERNITY OR AT THE LEAST SO LONG AS BRAIN AND HEART HAVE FACULTY BY NATURE TO SUBSIST
MURDEROUS BLOODY FULL OF BLAME SAVAGE EXTREME RUDE CRUEL NOT TO TRUST ENJOY'D NO SOONER BUT DESPISED STRAIGHT PAST REASON HUNTED
THE SUMMER'S FLOWER IS TO THE SUMMER SWEET THOUGH TO ITSELF IT ONLY LIVE AND DIE BUT IF THAT FLOWER WITH BASE INFECTION MEET THE BASEST WEED
MY LOVE'S SWEET FACE SURVEY IF TIME HAVE ANY WRINKLE GRAVEN THERE IF ANY BE A SATIRE TO DECAY
THE PURPLE PRIDE WHICH ON THY SOFT CHEEK FOR COMPLEXION DWELLS IN MY LOVE'S VEINS THOU HAST TOO GROSSLY DY'D
A TRUE SOUL WHEN MOST IMPEACH'D STANDS LEAST IN THY CONTROL
WHATE'ER THY THOUGHTS OR THY HEART'S WORKINGS BE
HOW LIKE EVE'S APPLE DOTH THY BEAUTY GROW IF THY SWEET VIRTUE ANSWER NOT THY SHOW
SOME GLORY IN THEIR BIRTH SOME IN THEIR SKILL SOME IN THEIR WEALTH SOME IN THEIR BODY'S FORCE SOME IN THEIR GARMENTS THOUGH NEW FANGLED ILL
BUT NOW IS BLACK BEAUTY'S SUCCESSIVE HEIR AND BEAUTY SLANDER'D WITH A BASTARD SHAME FOR SINCE EACH HAND HATH PUT ON NATURE'S POWER FAIRING THE FOUL WITH ART'S FALSE BORROWED FACE
WHERE ART THOU MUSE THAT THOU FORGET'ST SO LONG TO SPEAK OF THAT WHICH GIVES THEE ALL THY MIGHT SPEND'ST THOU THY FURY ON SOME WORTHLESS SONG
NO I AM THAT I AM AND THEY THAT LEVEL AT MY ABUSES RECKON UP THEIR OWN I MAY BE STRAIGHT THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES BE BEVEL
THEY ARE BUT DRESSINGS OF A FORMER SIGHT OUR DATES ARE BRIEF AND THEREFORE WE ADMIRE WHAT THOU DOST FOIST UPON US THAT IS OLD AND RATHER MAKE THEM BORN TO OUR DESIRE THAN THINK THAT WE BEFORE HAVE HEARD THEM TOLD
THY RECORD NEVER CAN BE MISS'D THAT POOR RETENTION COULD NOT SO MUCH HOLD NOR NEED I TALLIES THY DEAR LOVE TO SCORE THEREFORE TO GIVE THEM FROM ME WAS I BOLD
O THOU MY LOVELY BOY WHO IN THY POWER DOST HOLD TIME'S FICKLE GLASS HIS FICKLE HOUR WHO HAST BY WANING GROWN
FROM YOU HAVE I BEEN ABSENT IN THE SPRING WHEN PROUD PIED APRIL DRESS'D IN ALL HIS TRIM HATH PUT A SPIRIT OF YOUTH IN EVERY THING
SINCE THAT MY LIFE ON THY REVOLT DOTH LIE
THY REGISTERS AND THEE I BOTH DEFY NOT WONDERING AT THE PRESENT NOR THE PAST FOR THY RECORDS AND WHAT WE SEE DOTH LIE
LET ME BE OBSEQUIOUS IN THY HEART AND TAKE THOU MY OBLATION POOR BUT FREE WHICH IS NOT MIX'D WITH SECONDS KNOWS NO ART BUT MUTUAL RENDER ONLY ME FOR THEE HENCE THOU SUBORNED INFORMER
IT SUFFERS NOT IN SMILING POMP NOR FALLS UNDER THE BLOW OF THRALLED DISCONTENT
IN MANY'S LOOKS THE FALSE HEART'S HISTORY IS WRIT IN MOODS AND FROWNS AND WRINKLES STRANGE BUT HEAVEN IN THY CREATION DID DECREE THAT IN THY FACE SWEET LOVE SHOULD EVER DWELL
YET WELL I KNOW THAT MUSIC HATH A FAR MORE PLEASING SOUND I GRANT I NEVER SAW A GODDESS GO MY MISTRESS WHEN SHE WALKS TREADS ON THE GROUND
BUT NO SUCH ROSES SEE I IN HER CHEEKS AND IN SOME PERFUMES IS THERE MORE DELIGHT THAN IN THE BREATH THAT FROM MY MISTRESS REEKS I LOVE TO HEAR HER SPEAK
THAT TONGUE THAT TELLS THE STORY OF THY DAYS MAKING LASCIVIOUS COMMENTS ON THY SPORT CANNOT DISPRAISE BUT IN A KIND OF PRAISE NAMING THY NAME BLESSES AN ILL REPORT
O WHAT A MANSION HAVE THOSE VICES GOT WHICH FOR THEIR HABITATION CHOSE OUT THEE WHERE BEAUTY'S VEIL DOTH COVER EVERY BLOT AND ALL THINGS TURNS TO FAIR THAT EYES CAN SEE
IF NATURE SOVEREIGN MISTRESS OVER WRACK AS THOU GOEST ONWARDS STILL WILL PLUCK THEE BACK SHE KEEPS THEE TO THIS PURPOSE
OUTBRAVES HIS DIGNITY FOR SWEETEST THINGS TURN SOUREST BY THEIR DEEDS LILIES THAT FESTER SMELL FAR WORSE THAN WEEDS
TIS BETTER TO BE VILE THAN VILE ESTEEM'D WHEN NOT TO BE RECEIVES REPROACH OF BEING AND THE JUST PLEASURE LOST WHICH IS SO DEEM'D NOT BY OUR FEELING BUT BY OTHERS SEEING
LIKE WIDOW'D WOMBS AFTER THEIR LORDS DECEASE YET THIS ABUNDANT ISSUE SEEM'D TO ME BUT HOPE OF ORPHANS AND UNFATHER'D FRUIT FOR SUMMER AND HIS PLEASURES WAIT ON THEE
AND THEY MOURNERS SEEM AT SUCH WHO NOT BORN FAIR NO BEAUTY LACK SLAND'RING CREATION WITH A FALSE ESTEEM YET SO THEY MOURN
THE FOOLS OF TIME WHICH DIE FOR GOODNESS WHO HAVE LIVED FOR CRIME
AND WILL DO NONE THAT DO NOT DO THE THING THEY MOST DO SHOW WHO MOVING OTHERS ARE THEMSELVES AS STONE
HAPPY TO HAVE THY LOVE HAPPY TO DIE
SWEET BEAUTY HATH NO NAME NO HOLY BOWER BUT IS PROFAN'D IF NOT LIVES IN DISGRACE
SOME IN THEIR HAWKS AND HOUNDS SOME IN THEIR HORSE AND EVERY HUMOUR HATH HIS ADJUNCT PLEASURE WHEREIN IT FINDS A JOY ABOVE THE REST BUT THESE PARTICULARS ARE NOT MY MEASURE
THY LOOKS WITH ME THY HEART IN OTHER PLACE FOR THERE CAN LIVE NO HATRED IN THINE EYE THEREFORE IN THAT I CANNOT KNOW THY CHANGE
AND NO SOONER HAD PAST REASON HATED AS A SWALLOW'D BAIT ON PURPOSE LAID TO MAKE THE TAKER MAD MAD IN PURSUIT AND IN POSSESSION SO HAD HAVING AND IN QUEST TO HAVE
THEY RIGHTLY DO INHERIT HEAVEN'S GRACES AND HUSBAND NATURE'S RICHES FROM EXPENSE THEY ARE THE LORDS AND OWNERS OF THEIR FACES OTHERS BUT STEWARDS OF THEIR EXCELLENCE
WHICH LIKE A CANKER IN THE FRAGRANT ROSE DOTH SPOT THE BEAUTY OF THY BUDDING NAME
DARKENING THY POWER TO LEND BASE SUBJECTS LIGHT RETURN FORGETFUL MUSE AND STRAIGHT REDEEM IN GENTLE NUMBERS TIME SO IDLY SPENT
BY FRICTION OF A HORSE'S TAIL ON THE ENTRAILS OF A CAT TO ROME SAID NERO IF TO SMOKE YOU TURN I SHALL NOT CEASE TO FIDDLE WHILE YOU BURN TO NERO ROME REPLIED PRAY DO YOUR WORST

THOUGH I SUSPECT THE AGED KNAVE HAD BEEN OF
WISE CHILD THIS WAS GREAT GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND A CUSTOMER WHO KNEW ALL THE VIRTUES OF THE ARTICLE IN ADVANCE REBECCA DIMPLED MORE AND MORE AND AT HER NEW FRIEND'S INVITATION SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT HIS SIDE NEAR THE EDGE OF THE PORCH
I'M KEEPING HOUSE TO DAY BUT I DON'T LIVE HERE EXPLAINED THE DELIGHTFUL GENTLEMAN I'M JUST ON A VISIT TO MY AUNT WHO HAS GONE TO PORTLAND I USED TO BE HERE AS A BOY AND I AM VERY FOND OF THE SPOT
AT ALL EVENTS HE HAD AN AIR OF THE CITY ABOUT HIM WELL SHAVEN FACE WELL TRIMMED MUSTACHE WELL FITTING CLOTHES REBECCA WAS A TRIFLE SHY AT THIS UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT EXPLAIN HER PRESENCE
AND THE PRICES OF BOTH THAT AND THE SNOW WHITE WERE UNFOLDED PRESENTLY SHE FORGOT ALL ABOUT HER SILENT PARTNER AT THE GATE AND WAS TALKING AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN THIS GRAND PERSONAGE ALL HER LIFE
WITH A PINK SASH PINK STOCKINGS BRONZE SLIPPERS
I'D RATHER BE AN APPLE TREE IN BLOSSOM THAT ONE THAT BLOOMS PINK BY OUR PIG PEN REBECCA LAUGHED THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING UNEXPECTED IN EMMA JANE'S REPLIES
OH EMMA JANE EMMA JANE WE ARE SOLD OUT MISTER ALADDIN FOLLOWED SMILINGLY TO CORROBORATE THIS ASTONISHING UNBELIEVABLE STATEMENT LIFTED ALL THEIR BOXES FROM THE BACK OF THE WAGON
DRAWING UP TO A GATEWAY AND INDICATING A HOUSE THAT WAS SET A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE ROAD I HAVEN'T GOT OVER TREMBLING FROM THE LAST PLACE YET A LADY HAD PUT HER HEAD OUT OF AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW AND CALLED
WHICH HAD BEEN BORN AND REARED IN A STATE OF ADVENTUROUS POVERTY AND PERILOUS UNCERTAINTY RIVERBORO WAS DOING ITS BEST TO RETURN THE ENTIRE TRIBE OF SIMPSONS TO THE LAND OF ITS FATHERS SO TO SPEAK
I CAN REMEMBER MINE WELL ENOUGH AND A PARTICULARLY UNPLEASANT ONE IT WAS SAID THE STRANGER SO WAS MINE SIGHED REBECCA WHAT WAS YOUR WORST TROUBLE LACK OF FOOD AND CLOTHES PRINCIPALLY
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING TAKES THE PLACE OF THE FARM WHERE ONE LIVED WHEN ONE WAS A CHILD OBSERVED REBECCA NEARLY BURSTING WITH PRIDE AT HAVING AT LAST SUCCESSFULLY USED THE INDEFINITE PRONOUN IN GENERAL CONVERSATION
OH DON'T MENTION IT LAUGHED MISTER ALADDIN LIFTING HIS HAT I WAS A SORT OF COMMERCIAL TRAVELER MYSELF ONCE YEARS AGO AND I LIKE TO SEE THE THING WELL DONE GOOD BY MISS REBECCA ROWENA
IT WAS A RUSTLY DAY A SCARLET AND BUFF YELLOW AND CARMINE BRONZE AND CRIMSON DAY THERE WERE STILL MANY LEAVES ON THE OAKS AND MAPLES MAKING A GOODLY SHOW OF RED AND BROWN AND GOLD
I SEE WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT I'LL TAKE THREE HUNDRED CAKES AND THAT WILL GIVE THEM SHADE AND ALL
SHE WAS AN INDULGENT PARENT HOWEVER AND REALLY HAD LITTLE OBJECTION TO EMMA JANE AMUSING HERSELF IN THIS UNUSUAL WAY IT WAS ONLY FOR REBECCA AS THE NIECE OF THE DIFFICULT MIRANDA SAWYER THAT SHE RAISED SCRUPLES
THINKING RIGHTLY THAT THE TOWN WHICH HAD GIVEN THEM BIRTH RATHER THAN THE TOWN OF THEIR ADOPTION SHOULD FEED THEM AND KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS UNTIL THE CHILDREN WERE OF AN AGE FOR SELF SUPPORT THERE WAS LITTLE TO EAT IN THE HOUSEHOLD
DULL EMMA JANE HAD NEVER SEEMED TO REBECCA SO NEAR SO DEAR SO TRIED AND TRUE AND REBECCA TO EMMA JANE'S FAITHFUL HEART HAD NEVER BEEN SO BRILLIANT SO BEWILDERING SO FASCINATING AS IN THIS VISIT TOGETHER
AND INTERVIEWED ANY ONE WHO SEEMED OF A COMING ON DISPOSITION EMMA JANE HAD DISPOSED OF THREE SINGLE CAKES REBECCA OF THREE SMALL BOXES FOR A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO PERSUADE THE PUBLIC WAS CLEARLY DEFINED AT THE START
OH REBECCA HOW COULD YOU CALL HIM A NICKNAME THE VERY FIRST TIME YOU EVER SAW HIM ALADDIN ISN'T A NICKNAME EXACTLY ANYWAY HE LAUGHED AND SEEMED TO LIKE IT
THE VERY PUREST CORROBORATED REBECCA NO ACID IN IT NOT A TRACE AND YET A CHILD COULD DO THE MONDAY WASHING WITH IT AND USE NO FORCE A BABE CORRECTED REBECCA
THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AT EMMA JANE'S HOUSE WHERE REBECCA TO HER UNBOUNDED JOY WAS TO STAY OVER SUNDAY HER AUNTS HAVING GONE TO PORTLAND TO THE FUNERAL OF AN OLD FRIEND
THE AIR WAS LIKE SPARKLING CIDER AND EVERY FIELD HAD ITS HEAPS OF YELLOW AND RUSSET GOOD THINGS TO EAT ALL READY FOR THE BARNS THE MILLS AND THE MARKETS THE HORSE FORGOT HIS TWENTY YEARS
HOW MUCH HAS YOUR AUNT ON HAND NOW SUGGESTED THE VERY MODEST AND INEXPERIENCED AGENT AND HOW MUCH WOULD SHE NEED
OH EXCLAIMED REBECCA SYMPATHETICALLY MINE WAS NO SHOES AND TOO MANY BABIES AND NOT ENOUGH BOOKS BUT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT AND HAPPY NOW AREN'T YOU SHE ASKED DOUBTFULLY FOR THOUGH HE LOOKED HANDSOME WELL FED AND PROSPEROUS
JUST LET ME KNOW WHENEVER YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SELL FOR I'M CERTAIN BEFOREHAND I SHALL WANT IT GOOD BY MISTER ALADDIN I SURELY WILL CRIED REBECCA TOSSING BACK HER DARK BRAIDS DELIGHTEDLY AND WAVING HER HAND OH REBECCA SAID EMMA JANE IN AN AWE STRUCK WHISPER
TIPPED OVER AND DISAPPEARED INTO A CLUMP OF LILAC BUSHES IT WAS A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FORTUNATELY AND THE AMUSED CAPITALIST PICKED HER UP SET HER ON HER FEET AND BRUSHED HER OFF YOU SHOULD NEVER SEEM SURPRISED WHEN YOU HAVE TAKEN A LARGE ORDER SAID HE
FROM WHICH THE JOY DAZZLED AGENT MIGHT TAKE HIS CHOICE SEESAW SIMPSON WAS NOT IN THE SYNDICATE CLARA BELLE WAS RATHER A SUCCESSFUL AGENT BUT SUSAN WHO COULD ONLY SAY THOAP NEVER MADE LARGE RETURNS
SATURDAY BEING A HOLIDAY THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE THE OLD WHITE HORSE DRIVE TO NORTH RIVERBORO THREE MILES AWAY EAT A TWELVE O'CLOCK DINNER WITH EMMA JANE'S COUSINS AND BE BACK AT FOUR O'CLOCK PUNCTUALLY
WHEN THE CHILDREN ASKED MISSUS PERKINS IF THEY COULD CALL AT JUST A FEW HOUSES COMING AND GOING AND SELL A LITTLE SOAP FOR THE SIMPSONS SHE AT FIRST REPLIED DECIDEDLY IN THE NEGATIVE
IF THEY SELL TWO HUNDRED MORE CAKES THIS MONTH AND NEXT THEY CAN HAVE THE LAMP BY CHRISTMAS REBECCA ANSWERED AND THEY CAN GET A SHADE BY SUMMER TIME BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HELP VERY MUCH AFTER TO DAY BECAUSE MY AUNT MIRANDA MAY NOT LIKE TO HAVE ME
SEE MY SCARLET DRESS IN MY BEAUTIFUL LOOKING GLASS AND WATCH ALL THE YELLOW AND BROWN TREES GROWING UPSIDE DOWN IN THE WATER WHEN I'M OLD ENOUGH TO EARN MONEY I'M GOING TO HAVE A DRESS LIKE THIS LEAF
WITH THE VISION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S TURKEYS BURSTING WITH FAT AND OTHER PEOPLE'S GOLDEN PUMPKINS AND SQUASHES AND CORN BEING GARNERED INTO BARNS THE YOUNG SIMPSONS GROPED ABOUT FOR SOME INEXPENSIVE FORM OF EXCITEMENT
BABE NOT BABY CORRECTED REBECCA FROM THE CIRCULAR IT'S JUST THE SAME THING ARGUED EMMA JANE OF COURSE IT'S JUST THE SAME THING BUT A BABY HAS GOT TO BE CALLED BABE OR INFANT IN A CIRCULAR
OH WON'T IT BE THE GREATEST FUN EMMA JANE AT SOME OF THE HOUSES WHERE THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW ME I SHAN'T BE FRIGHTENED AND I SHALL REEL OFF THE WHOLE RIGMAROLE INVALID BABE AND ALL
BUT A NOTE IN THE MARGIN OF THE CIRCULAR INFORMED THEM THAT IT STOOD TWO AND A HALF FEET HIGH WHEN SET UP IN ALL ITS DIGNITY AND SPLENDOR ON A PROPER TABLE THREE DOLLARS EXTRA IT WAS ONLY OF POLISHED BRASS CONTINUED THE CIRCULAR
THEY DID NOT ACCOMPANY EACH OTHER TO THE DOORS OF THEIR CHOSEN VICTIMS FEELING SURE THAT TOGETHER THEY COULD NOT APPROACH THE SUBJECT SERIOUSLY BUT THEY PARTED AT THE GATE OF EACH HOUSE THE ONE HOLDING THE HORSE WHILE THE OTHER TOOK THE SOAP SAMPLES
SO SHE ASKED IS THE LADY OF THE HOUSE AT HOME I AM THE LADY OF THE HOUSE AT PRESENT SAID THE STRANGER WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE WOULD YOU LIKE OR I MEAN
WHAT IF YOUR AUNT SHOULDN'T LIKE THE KIND OF SOAP QUERIED REBECCA NERVOUSLY MY AUNT ALWAYS LIKES WHAT I LIKE HE RETURNED MINE DOESN'T EXCLAIMED REBECCA THEN THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR AUNT OR WITH ME LAUGHED REBECCA
THEIR POVERTY THEIR JOYLESS LIFE AND THEIR ABJECT NEED OF A BANQUET LAMP TO BRIGHTEN THEIR EXISTENCE YOU NEEDN'T ARGUE THAT POINT LAUGHED THE MAN AS HE STOOD UP TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE RICH BLACKSMITH'S DAUGHTER AT THE GATE
AND SETTLED UPON THE SELLING OF SOAP FOR A PREMIUM THEY HAD SOLD ENOUGH TO THEIR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS DURING THE EARLIER AUTUMN TO SECURE A CHILD'S HANDCART WHICH THOUGH VERY WEAK ON ITS PINS COULD BE TRUNDLED OVER THE COUNTRY ROADS
WITH HIGHLY COLORED PICTURES OF THE PREMIUMS TO BE AWARDED FOR THE SALE OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CAKES IT WAS AT THIS JUNCTURE THAT CLARA BELLE AND SUSAN SIMPSON CONSULTED REBECCA WHO THREW HERSELF SOLIDLY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE ENTERPRISE
SNOW WHITE ROSE RED JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING THE AFFAIRS OF THE SIMPSONS REACHED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED A CRISIS EVEN IN THEIR FAMILY
ON THANKSGIVING THE LAMP ARRIVED IN A LARGE PACKING BOX AND WAS TAKEN OUT AND SET UP BY SEESAW SIMPSON WHO SUDDENLY BEGAN TO ADMIRE AND RESPECT THE BUSINESS ABILITY OF HIS SISTERS
WE ARE NOT SELLING FOR OUR OWN BENEFIT SAID REBECCA CONFIDENTIALLY MY FRIEND WHO IS HOLDING THE HORSE AT THE GATE IS THE DAUGHTER OF A VERY RICH BLACKSMITH AND DOESN'T NEED ANY MONEY
AND LESS TO WEAR THOUGH MISSUS SIMPSON DID AS ALWAYS HER POOR BEST THE CHILDREN MANAGED TO SATISFY THEIR APPETITES BY SITTING MODESTLY OUTSIDE THEIR NEIGHBORS KITCHEN DOORS WHEN MEALS WERE ABOUT TO BE SERVED
BUT WHEN FULLY PERSUADED THAT THE ENTERPRISE WAS A CHARITABLE ONE SHE ACQUIESCED THE GIRLS CALLED AT MISTER WATSON'S STORE AND ARRANGED FOR SEVERAL LARGE BOXES OF SOAP TO BE CHARGED TO CLARA BELLE SIMPSON'S ACCOUNT
I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID REBECCA CONSCIENTIOUSLY BUT I'LL LOOK IN THE CIRCULAR IT'S SURE TO TELL AND SHE DREW THE DOCUMENT FROM HER POCKET WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE MAGNIFICENT PROFITS YOU GET FROM THIS BUSINESS
AT THE MAN'S NOD OF ASSENT REBECCA SPED DOWN THE LANE
AND THE LATTER BEING INTENDED FOR THE TOILET THERE WAS A GREAT AMOUNT OF HILARITY IN THE PREPARATION FOR THIS EVENT AND A LONG COUNCIL IN EMMA JANE'S ATTIC THEY HAD THE SOAP COMPANY'S CIRCULAR FROM WHICH TO ARRANGE A PROPER SPEECH
I DON'T GET TO FEELING LIKE A FOOL SO AWFULLY EASY NOW LEAVE OUT THAT EATING PART IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT AND GO ON THE SNOW WHITE IS PROBABLY THE MOST REMARKABLE LAUNDRY SOAP EVER MANUFACTURED
IMMERSE THE GARMENTS IN A TUB LIGHTLY RUBBING THE MORE SOILED PORTIONS WITH THE SOAP LEAVE THEM SUBMERGED IN WATER FROM SUNSET TO SUNRISE AND THEN THE YOUNGEST BABY CAN WASH THEM WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST EFFORT
GREAT WIDE BEAUTIFUL WONDERFUL WORLD WITH THE WONDERFUL WATER ROUND YOU CURLED AND THE WONDERFUL GRASS UPON YOUR BREAST WORLD YOU ARE BEAUTIFULLY DREST
I THINK I KNOW ALREADY ANSWERED REBECCA WITH A BRIGHT GLANCE I'M SURE YOU MUST BE MISTER ALADDIN IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS OH PLEASE CAN I RUN DOWN AND TELL EMMA JANE SHE MUST BE SO TIRED WAITING AND SHE WILL BE SO GLAD
THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY POPULAR FAVORITES BUT THEY DID RECEIVE CERTAIN UNDESIRABLE MORSELS FROM THE MORE CHARITABLE HOUSEWIVES LIFE WAS RATHER DULL AND DREARY HOWEVER AND IN THE CHILL AND GLOOM OF NOVEMBER WEATHER
TO SHOW WHAT MY LEAVES WERE LIKE BEFORE I WAS A SCARLET MAPLE I THINK IT WOULD BE AWFUL HOMELY SAID EMMA JANE
REBECCA WALKED UP THE LANE AND WENT TO THE SIDE DOOR THERE WAS A PORCH THERE AND SEATED IN A ROCKING CHAIR HUSKING CORN WAS A GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN OR WAS HE MIDDLE AGED REBECCA COULD NOT MAKE UP HER MIND
WE ARE TRYING TO GET A PREMIUM FOR SOME FRIENDS OF OURS REBECCA HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF ALLUDING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH HER PREVIOUS CUSTOMERS BUT UNEXPECTEDLY SHE FOUND HERSELF DESCRIBING MISTER SIMPSON MISSUS SIMPSON AND THE SIMPSON FAMILY
ANY CHILD COULD SEE THAT HIS EYES WERE TIRED AND HIS MOUTH WAS SAD WHEN HE WAS NOT SPEAKING I'M DOING PRETTY WELL THANK YOU SAID THE MAN WITH A DELIGHTFUL SMILE
EMMA JANE HAD ENJOYED CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE OF THIS KIND AND REBECCA HAD SUCCEEDED IN UNSTOPPING HER EARS UNGLUING HER EYES AND LOOSENING HER TONGUE SO THAT SHE COULD PLAY THE GAME AFTER A FASHION
NOT COUNTING MISTER SIMPSON WHO ORDINARILY SAT ELSEWHERE AT THE TOWN'S EXPENSE THEY WARMED THEMSELVES RAPTUROUSLY IN THE VISION OF THE BANQUET LAMP WHICH SPEEDILY BECAME TO THEM MORE DESIRABLE THAN FOOD DRINK OR CLOTHING
PROMISING HER HELP AND THAT OF EMMA JANE PERKINS THE PREMIUMS WITHIN THEIR POSSIBLE GRASP WERE THREE A BOOKCASE A PLUSH RECLINING CHAIR AND A BANQUET LAMP OF COURSE THE SIMPSONS HAD NO BOOKS
AY SWEAT FOR THE HAPPY PRIVILEGE OF OCCUPYING THE SAME ROOM WITH THAT LAMP THROUGH THE COMING WINTER EVENINGS IT LOOKED TO BE ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL IN THE CATALOGUE AND EMMA JANE ADVISED CLARA BELLE TO MEASURE THE HEIGHT OF THE SIMPSON CEILINGS
SNIFFED THE SWEET BRIGHT AIR AND TROTTED LIKE A COLT NOKOMIS MOUNTAIN LOOKED BLUE AND CLEAR IN THE DISTANCE REBECCA STOOD IN THE WAGON AND APOSTROPHIZED THE LANDSCAPE WITH SUDDEN JOY OF LIVING
THESE WERE LIFTED INTO THE BACK OF THE WAGON AND A HAPPIER COUPLE NEVER DROVE ALONG THE COUNTRY ROAD THAN REBECCA AND HER COMPANION IT WAS A GLORIOUS INDIAN SUMMER DAY WHICH SUGGESTED NOTHING OF THANKSGIVING NEAR AT HAND AS IT WAS
DO YOU NEED ANY SOAP QUERIED REBECCA DO I LOOK AS IF I DID HE RESPONDED UNEXPECTEDLY REBECCA DIMPLED I DIDN'T MEAN THAT I HAVE SOME SOAP TO SELL
OH REBECCA DON'T LET'S SAY THAT INTERPOSED EMMA JANE HYSTERICALLY IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A FOOL IT TAKES SO LITTLE TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A FOOL EMMA JANE REBUKED REBECCA THAT SOMETIMES I THINK THAT YOU MUST BE ONE
I MEAN I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A VERY REMARKABLE SOAP THE BEST NOW ON THE MARKET IT IS CALLED THE OH I MUST KNOW THAT SOAP SAID THE GENTLEMAN GENIALLY MADE OUT OF PURE VEGETABLE FATS ISN'T IT
GO AWAY LITTLE GIRL WHATEVER YOU HAVE IN YOUR BOX WE DON'T WANT ANY I DON'T KNOW WHO LIVES HERE AND THE BLINDS ARE ALL SHUT IN FRONT IF THERE'S NOBODY AT HOME YOU MUSTN'T COUNT IT BUT TAKE THE NEXT HOUSE AS YOURS
BY DINT OF SUPERHUMAN EFFORT AND PUTTING SUCH A SEAL UPON THEIR LIPS AS NEVER MORTALS PUT BEFORE THE TWO GIRLS SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING THEIR WONDERFUL NEWS TO THEMSELVES
IN AN ECSTASY OF REMINISCENCE OH ISN'T HE PERFECTLY ELERGANT AND WASN'T IT LOVELY OF HIM TO BUY US OUT AND JUST THINK OF HAVING BOTH THE LAMP AND THE SHADE FOR ONE DAY'S WORK AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU WORE YOUR PINK GINGHAM NOW
NEITHER EMMA JANE NOR REBECCA PERCEIVED ANYTHING INCONGRUOUS IN THE IDEA OF THE SIMPSONS STRIVING FOR A BANQUET LAMP THEY LOOKED AT THE PICTURE DAILY AND KNEW THAT IF THEY THEMSELVES WERE FREE AGENTS THEY WOULD TOIL SUFFER
EMMA JANE PRACTICED IT ON REBECCA AND REBECCA ON EMMA JANE CAN I SELL YOU A LITTLE SOAP THIS AFTERNOON IT IS CALLED THE SNOW WHITE AND ROSE RED SOAP
AND THEY HAD WHAT WAS STILL BETTER THE REMEMBRANCE OF A CERTAIN PATENT MEDICINE VENDER'S DISCOURSE AT THE MILLTOWN FAIR HIS METHOD WHEN ONCE OBSERVED COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN NOR HIS MANNER NOR HIS VOCABULARY
AND THE TWINS WHO WERE SOMEWHAT YOUNG TO BE THOROUGHLY TRUSTWORTHY COULD BE GIVEN ONLY A HALF DOZEN CAKES AT A TIME AND WERE OBLIGED TO CARRY WITH THEM ON THEIR BUSINESS TRIPS A BRIEF DOCUMENT STATING THE PRICE PER CAKE DOZEN AND BOX
AND LET ELIJAH OR ELISHA TRY THE SOAP BEFORE WE BEGIN SELLING I CAN'T IMAGINE A BABE DOING A FAMILY WASH WITH ANY SOAP ANSWERED REBECCA BUT IT MUST BE TRUE OR THEY WOULD NEVER DARE TO PRINT IT SO DON'T LET'S BOTHER
REBECCA AND EMMA JANE OFFERED TO GO TWO OR THREE MILES IN SOME ONE DIRECTION AND SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO IN THE WAY OF STIRRING UP A POPULAR DEMAND FOR THE SNOW WHITE AND ROSE RED BRANDS THE FORMER BEING DEVOTED TO LAUNDRY PURPOSES
NEVER MIND SAID EMMA JANE COMFORTINGLY EVERYBODY SAYS YOU'RE AWFUL BRIGHT AND SMART AND MOTHER THINKS YOU'LL BE BETTER LOOKING ALL THE TIME AS YOU GROW OLDER YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT BUT I WAS A DREADFUL HOMELY BABY
I'D CHOOSE TO BE THAT SCARLET MAPLE JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE POND THERE AND SHE POINTED WITH THE WHIP THEN I COULD SEE SO MUCH MORE THAN YOUR PINK APPLE TREE BY THE PIG PEN I COULD LOOK AT ALL THE REST OF THE WOODS
SO YOU CONSIDER YOUR CHILDHOOD A THING OF THE PAST DO YOU YOUNG LADY I CAN STILL REMEMBER IT ANSWERED REBECCA GRAVELY THOUGH IT SEEMS A LONG TIME AGO
PERHAPS I SHALL SAY EVEN THE LAST SENTENCE IF I CAN REMEMBER IT WE SOUND EVERY CHORD IN THE GREAT MAC RO COSM OF SATISFACTION
AUNT MIRANDA WOULD SAY THAT WAS JUST LIKE ME AND IT IS BUT I CALLED HIM MISTER ALADDIN BECAUSE HE GAVE US A LAMP YOU KNOW THE STORY OF ALADDIN AND THE WONDERFUL LAMP
I CAN SEE THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE IT IF THEY WANT IT AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT THEM TO HAVE IT I'VE KNOWN WHAT IT WAS MYSELF TO DO WITHOUT A BANQUET LAMP NOW GIVE ME THE CIRCULAR AND LET'S DO SOME FIGURING HOW MUCH DO THE SIMPSONS LACK AT THIS MOMENT
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT FOR YOU TO BUY SO MUCH ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN AFFORD IT
HE RAISED HIS HAT TO US AND WE NOT THIRTEEN IT'LL BE FIVE YEARS BEFORE WE'RE LADIES NEVER MIND ANSWERED REBECCA WE ARE THE BEGINNINGS OF LADIES EVEN NOW HE TUCKED THE LAP ROBE ROUND US TOO CONTINUED EMMA JANE
SIX CAKES IN AN ORNAMENTAL BOX ONLY TWENTY CENTS FOR THE WHITE TWENTY FIVE CENTS FOR THE RED IT IS MADE FROM THE PUREST INGREDIENTS AND IF DESIRED COULD BE EATEN BY AN INVALID WITH RELISH AND PROFIT
THOUGH NEITHER OF THEM ASCRIBED EITHER SUCCESS OR DEFEAT TO ANYTHING BUT THE IMPERIOUS FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES HOUSEWIVES LOOKED AT EMMA JANE AND DESIRED NO SOAP LISTENED TO HER DESCRIPTION OF ITS MERITS AND STILL DESIRED NONE
THEN I THINK I'LL HAVE A BROWN SASH LIKE THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AND WHERE COULD I BE GREEN DO THEY HAVE GREEN PETTICOATS I WONDER I'D LIKE A GREEN PETTICOAT COMING OUT NOW AND THEN UNDERNEATH
NO IT DON'T NOT A MITE PERHAPS DIZZY ISN'T JUST THE RIGHT WORD BUT IT'S NEAREST I'D LIKE TO EAT COLOR AND DRINK IT AND SLEEP IN IT IF YOU COULD BE A TREE WHICH ONE WOULD YOU CHOOSE
WHAT IS YOUR NAME YOUNG LADY REBECCA ROWENA RANDALL SIR WHAT WITH AN AMUSED SMILE BOTH YOUR MOTHER WAS GENEROUS SHE COULDN'T BEAR TO GIVE UP EITHER OF THE NAMES SHE SAYS
WITH ITS INTIMACY ITS FREEDOM AND THE ADDED DELIGHTS OF AN EXCITING BUSINESS ENTERPRISE A GORGEOUS LEAF BLEW INTO THE WAGON DOES COLOR MAKE YOU SORT OF DIZZY ASKED REBECCA
THAT LUCKY REBECCA ACCOMPLISHED WITH ALMOST NO EFFORT RESULTS THAT POOR LITTLE EMMA JANE FAILED TO ATTAIN BY HARD AND CONSCIENTIOUS LABOR IT'S YOUR TURN REBECCA AND I'M GLAD TOO SAID EMMA JANE
AND CASTING ASIDE WITHOUT THOUGHT OR PANG THE PLUSH CHAIR
WITH LARGE BUSINESS SAGACITY AND AN EXECUTIVE CAPACITY WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN INHERITED FROM THEIR FATHER THEY NOW PROPOSED TO EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO A LARGER AREA AND DISTRIBUTE SOAP TO CONTIGUOUS VILLAGES
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE REPLIED CAN'T YOU MAKE IT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY INSTEAD OF CAPSIZING IN THAT UNBUSINESSLIKE WAY OH I COULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT EXCLAIMED REBECCA WHO WAS BLUSHING CRIMSON AT HER AWKWARD FALL
AND REBECCA LOOKED LONGINGLY AT EMMA JANE'S FAT ROSY CHEEKS AT HER BLUE EYES WHICH SAID NOTHING AT HER NEAT NOSE WHICH HAD NO CHARACTER AT HER RED LIPS FROM BETWEEN WHICH NO WORD WORTH LISTENING TO HAD EVER ISSUED
IT WOULD BE RATHER A NICE SURPRISE TO HAVE THE LAMP ARRIVE AT THE SIMPSONS ON THANKSGIVING DAY WOULDN'T IT HE ASKED AS HE TUCKED THE OLD LAP ROBE COSILY OVER THEIR FEET
THE SAME AS IT IS IN POETRY WOULD YOU RATHER SAY INFANT NO GRUMBLED EMMA JANE INFANT IS WORSE EVEN THAN BABE
OTHER STARS IN THEIR COURSES GOVERNED REBECCA'S DOINGS THE PEOPLE WHOM SHE INTERVIEWED EITHER REMEMBERED THEIR PRESENT NEED OF SOAP OR REMINDED THEMSELVES THAT THEY WOULD NEED IT IN THE FUTURE THE NOTABLE POINT IN THE CASE BEING
AND TAKING THE CIRCULAR PROMISED TO WRITE TO THE EXCELSIOR COMPANY THAT NIGHT CONCERNING THE PREMIUM IF YOU COULD CONTRIVE TO KEEP A SECRET YOU TWO LITTLE GIRLS
THOUGH IT WAS INVARIABLY MISTAKEN FOR SOLID GOLD AND THE SHADE THAT ACCOMPANIED IT AT LEAST IT ACCOMPANIED IT IF THE AGENT SOLD A HUNDRED EXTRA CAKES WAS OF CRINKLED CREPE PAPER PRINTED IN A DOZEN DELICIOUS HUES
EVEN IF MOTHER DID MAKE YOU PUT ON FLANNEL UNDERNEATH YOU DO LOOK SO PRETTY IN PINK AND RED REBECCA AND SO HOMELY IN DRAB AND BROWN I KNOW IT SIGHED REBECCA I WISH I WAS LIKE YOU PRETTY IN ALL COLORS
IF THESE VILLAGES COULD BE INDUCED TO BUY THE EXCELSIOR SOAP COMPANY PAID A VERY SMALL RETURN OF ANY KIND TO ITS INFANTILE AGENTS WHO WERE SCATTERED THROUGH THE STATE BUT IT INFLAMED THEIR IMAGINATIONS BY THE ISSUE OF CIRCULARS
HAD I BEEN AN INFANT STERNE HERE WAS A GRAND CHANCE FOR SENTIMENTAL OUTPUT AS THINGS WERE I COULD ONLY HURRY HOMEWARDS MY MORAL TAIL WELL BETWEEN MY LEGS WITH AN UNEASY FEELING AS I GLANCED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER THAT THERE WAS MORE IN THIS CHANCE THAN MET THE EYE
AND PRESENTLY I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE VILLAGE CHURCH SITTING SOLITARY WITHIN ITS CIRCLE OF ELMS FROM FORTH THE VESTRY WINDOW PROJECTED TWO SMALL LEGS GYRATING HUNGRY FOR FOOTHOLD WITH LARCENY
A BELATED TRUANT YOU HAVE DRAGGED A WEARY FOOT HOMEWARD WITH ONLY A PALE EXPRESSIONLESS MOON FOR COMPANY TO DAY WHY NOT I THE TRICKSTER THE HYPOCRITE I WHO WHIP ROUND CORNERS AND BLUSTER RELAPSE AND EVADE THEN RALLY AND PURSUE
KNIT SEVEN MAKE ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER
AND LET HER ROMANCES WAIT NOW MESSAGES OF CONGRATULATION FLOWED IN AND BEAMING FACES SHOWED EVERYWHERE ROB AMAZED HIS PARENTS BY PRODUCING A POEM WHICH WAS REMARKABLY GOOD FOR ONE OF HIS YEARS AND DEMI SET IT TO MUSIC THAT IT MIGHT BE SUNG WHEN THE SAILOR BOY RETURNED
THOUGH THE WHOLE PLACE SWARMED WITH SUCH PORTENTS THEY CARED NOT ABOUT EXPLORING FOR ROBBERS CAVES NOR DIGGING FOR HIDDEN TREASURE PERHAPS INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THEIR BEST QUALITIES THAT THEY SPENT THE GREATER PART OF THEIR TIME STUFFILY INDOORS
EVEN AS THEIR MOVEMENTS WERE CONFINED AND SLOW AND THEIR HABITS STEREOTYPED AND SENSELESS TO ANYTHING BUT APPEARANCES THEY WERE BLIND
WE HAD JUST LEFT IT OUTSIDE AND WERE ALL ON FIRE TO GET BACK TO IT OF COURSE WE DIDN'T WASTE THE REVELATION ON THEM THE FUTILITY OF IMPARTING OUR IDEAS HAD LONG BEEN DEMONSTRATED ONE IN THOUGHT AND PURPOSE LINKED BY THE NECESSITY OF COMBATING ONE HOSTILE FATE
HOW COULD REASONABLE PEOPLE SPEND THEIR PRECIOUS TIME SO
A PLACE ELF HAUNTED WONDERFUL SIMPLY PRODUCED SO MANY APPLES AND CHERRIES OR IT DIDN'T WHEN THE FAILURES OF NATURE WERE NOT INFREQUENTLY ASCRIBED TO US
AND LET US BEAR IT TOGETHER EMIL'S SHIP IS LOST AND AS YET NO NEWS OF HIM IT WAS WELL MISTER BHAER HAD TAKEN HIS WIFE INTO HIS STRONG ARMS FOR SHE LOOKED READY TO DROP BUT BORE UP AFTER A MOMENT
A SADDENING DOUBT A DULL SUSPICION CREEPS OVER ME ET IN ARCADIA EGO
MAKE ONE KNIT ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER
ALWAYS STUCK STAUNCHLY TO A NEW FAD TILL HE HAD WORN IT QUITE OUT JUST AT PRESENT HE WAS A MUFFIN MAN
HE HAD FOUND THE LITTLE GUIDE BOOK THAT CHRISTIAN CARRIED IN HIS BOSOM AND LOVE PENITENCE AND PRAYER THE THREE SWEET SISTERS HAD GIVEN HIM THE ARMOUR WHICH WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE HE HAD NOT LEARNED TO WEAR IT YET AND CHAFED AGAINST IT THOUGH HE FELT ITS VALUE
MAKE ONE KNIT SEVEN MAKE ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT FOUR EIGHTH ROW SEAMED MAKING ONE AT THE BEGINNING NINTH ROW MAKE ONE KNIT FIVE
STOOD THE ANCIENT WHIPPING POST OF THE VILLAGE ITS SIDES FRETTED WITH THE INITIALS OF A GENERATION THAT SCORNED ITS MUTE LESSON BUT STILL CLIPPED BY THE STOUT RUSTY SHACKLES THAT HAD TETHERED THE WRISTS
HE FIDDLED NIGHT AFTER NIGHT IN THE DINGY LITTLE THEATRE AND HE STUDIED SO DILIGENTLY THAT HIS MASTER WAS WELL PLEASED AND KEPT HIM IN MIND AS ONE TO WHOM PREFERMENT WAS DUE IF ANY CHANCE OCCURRED GAY FRIENDS FORGOT HIM BUT THE OLD ONES STOOD FAST
KNIT TWO TOGETHER TWICE
AND IT WAS WITH A CERTAIN SURPRISE THAT I FOUND MYSELF REGARDING THESE FATUOUS ONES WITH KINDLINESS INSTEAD OF CONTEMPT AS I RAMBLED BY UNHEEDED OF THEM THERE WAS INDEED SOME RECONCILING INFLUENCE ABROAD WHICH COULD BRING THE LIKE ANTICS INTO HARMONY WITH BUD AND GROWTH AND THE FROLIC AIR
BUT WAS THE MATTER ALLOWED TO END THERE I TROW NOT AGAIN WHEN HAROLD WAS LOCKED UP IN HIS ROOM ALL DAY FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY UPON A NEIGHBOUR'S PIG AN ACTION HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED BEING INDEED ON THE FRIENDLIEST TERMS WITH THE PORKER IN QUESTION
PERHAPS TOO AT A SPECIAL BIT OF WAGGISHNESS HE HAD STILL IN STORE FOR WHEN AT LAST HE GREW WEARY OF SUCH INSIGNIFICANT EARTHBOUND COMPANY HE DESERTED ME AT A CERTAIN SPOT I KNEW THEN DROPPED SUBSIDED AND SLUNK AWAY INTO NOTHINGNESS
FOR THE BOY WAS DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THIS SUDDEN ECLIPSE OF THE FIREFLY WHOSE LIGHT AND LIFE ALL MISSED WHEN THEY WERE GONE AND LURED HER OUT EVERY DAY FOR LONG DRIVES BEHIND THE BLACK MARE WHO SHOOK HER SILVERY BELLS TILL THEY MADE SUCH MERRY MUSIC JOSIE COULD NOT HELP LISTENING TO IT
HAROLD IT FURTHER APPEARED GREATLY COVETING TADPOLES AND TOP HEAVY WITH THE EAGERNESS OF POSSESSION HAD FALLEN INTO THE POND THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOTHING BUT ON ATTEMPTING TO SNEAK IN
THOUGH EMIL WHO WAS TO ACCOMPANY THEM WOULD BE THE GREATER HERO LITTLE DID THE DEAR SOULS DREAM WHAT A SURPRISE WAS IN STORE FOR THEM AS THEY INNOCENTLY LAID THEIR PLANS AND WISHED ALL THE BOYS COULD BE THERE TO WELCOME HOME THEIR ELDEST AND THEIR CASABLANCA
KIND WISHES AND COMFORTABLE GIFTS FOR THE LONELY FELLOW WHO COULD HAVE FALLEN ON THEIR NECKS AND CRIED LIKE A GIRL AT SEEING HIS OLD MATES AGAIN HOW GLAD HE WAS TO BE FOUND IN HIS LITTLE ROOM BUSY AT HIS PROPER WORK NOT LIVING LIKE AN IDLE GENTLEMAN ON BORROWED MONEY
I CAN LEAD YOU THE BEST AND RAREST DANCE OF ANY FOR I AM THE STRONG CAPRICIOUS ONE THE LORD OF MISRULE AND I ALONE AM IRRESPONSIBLE AND UNPRINCIPLED AND OBEY NO LAW AND FOR ME I WAS READY ENOUGH TO FALL IN WITH THE FELLOW'S HUMOUR WAS NOT THIS A WHOLE HOLIDAY
OR ADMIT THEMSELVES IN THE WRONG OR TO ACCEPT SIMILAR CONCESSIONS ON OUR PART FOR INSTANCE WHEN I FLUNG THE CAT OUT OF AN UPPER WINDOW THOUGH I DID IT FROM NO ILL FEELING AND IT DIDN'T HURT THE CAT
NOTHING COULD COMFORT HER NAN DOSED IN VAIN DAISY'S CHEERFUL WORDS WENT BY LIKE THE WIND AND BESS'S DEVICES TO AMUSE HER ALL FAILED UTTERLY TO CRY IN MOTHER'S ARMS AND TALK ABOUT THE WRECK WHICH HAUNTED HER EVEN IN HER SLEEP WAS ALL SHE CARED TO DO
FRANZ KEPT THE CABLE BUSY WITH HIS VARYING MESSAGES NAT SENT LOVING LETTERS FROM LEIPZIG AND TOM HARASSED THE SHIPPING AGENTS FOR NEWS EVEN BUSY JACK WROTE THEM WITH UNUSUAL WARMTH
KNIT THREE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT FOUR MAKE ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER MAKE ONE KNIT THREE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT FOUR MAKE ONE KNIT THE REST
A WEARY UNRHYTHMIC THING OF RISE AND FALL AND YET IT SEEMED TO ME A GENUINE UTTERANCE AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE ONE THING FITTING AND RIGHT AND PERFECT HUMANITY WOULD HAVE REJECTED IT WITH SCORN NATURE EVERYWHERE SINGING IN THE SAME KEY
UNDER THE DELUSION THAT THESE PALE PHANTASMS OF REALITY WERE AMONG THE IMPORTANCES OF LIFE WE ILLUMINATI EATING SILENTLY OUR HEADS FULL OF PLANS AND CONSPIRACIES COULD HAVE TOLD THEM WHAT REAL LIFE WAS
BILL'S COVETED BOOTY TOO I COULD EASILY GUESS AT THAT IT CAME FROM THE VICAR'S STORE OF BISCUITS KEPT AS I KNEW
I CAN SEE NOW THAT TO CHILDREN WITH A PROPER EQUIPMENT OF PARENTS THESE THINGS WOULD HAVE WORN A DIFFERENT ASPECT BUT TO THOSE WHOSE NEAREST WERE AUNTS AND UNCLES A SPECIAL ATTITUDE OF MIND MAY BE ALLOWED THEY TREATED US INDEED WITH KINDNESS ENOUGH AS TO THE NEEDS OF THE FLESH
ONLY YOU MUSTN'T SAY I TOLD YOU COS IT'S TO BE A SURPRISE ALL RIGHT I SAID MAGNANIMOUSLY
AND MISSUS MEG WAS GETTING ANXIOUS WHEN MISS CAMERON SENT JOSIE A KIND NOTE
THERE WAS NO HANDSOME EXPRESSION OF REGRET ON THE DISCOVERY OF THE REAL CULPRIT WHAT HAROLD HAD FELT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE IMPRISONMENT INDEED HE HAD VERY SOON ESCAPED BY THE WINDOW WITH ASSISTANCE FROM HIS ALLIES AND HAD ONLY GONE BACK IN TIME FOR HIS RELEASE AS THE OLYMPIAN HABIT
NO I WON'T I SWEAR I WON'T PROTESTED EDWARD I'LL BE QUITE A NEW LION THIS TIME SOMETHING YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE AND HE RACED OFF TO HIS POST CHARLOTTE HESITATED THEN SHE WENT TIMIDLY ON
EMERGING OUT OF THE CLOUDS AND PASSING AWAY AGAIN TO DRAG ON AN AIMLESS EXISTENCE SOMEWHERE OUT OF OUR KEN THEN BRUTE FORCE WAS PITILESSLY APPLIED WE WERE CAPTURED WASHED AND FORCED INTO CLEAN COLLARS
SILENT FACE TO FACE O'ER A DISCREET UNWINKING STILE AS A RULE THIS SORT OF THING STRUCK ME AS THE MOST PITIFUL TOMFOOLERY TWO CALVES RUBBING NOSES THROUGH A GATE WERE NATURAL AND RIGHT AND WITHIN THE ORDER OF THINGS BUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS
WITH SALIENT INTERESTS AND ACTIVE PURSUITS BECKONING THEM ON FROM EVERY SIDE COULD THUS
RECOGNISED AND ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT A FLICKER OF DISSENT ALL THE TIME THE HEARTY WIND WAS CALLING TO ME COMPANIONABLY FROM WHERE HE SWUNG AND BELLOWED IN THE TREE TOPS
HE NEITHER LAUGHED NOR SNEERED AS THE OLYMPIANS WOULD HAVE DONE BUT POSSESSED OF A SERIOUS IDIOSYNCRASY HE WOULD CONTRIBUTE SUCH LOTS OF VALUABLE SUGGESTION
BUT THE PASSION AND THE CALL OF THE DIVINE MORNING WERE HIGH IN MY BLOOD EARTH TO EARTH THAT WAS THE FRANK NOTE THE JOYOUS SUMMONS OF THE DAY AND THEY COULD NOT BUT JAR AND SEEM ARTIFICIAL THESE HUMAN DISCUSSIONS AND PRETENCES
WHILE THEY WAIT AND WORK SO HAPPILY LET US SEE HOW OUR OTHER ABSENT BOYS ARE FARING AS THEY TOO WAIT AND WORK AND HOPE FOR BETTER DAYS NAT WAS TOILING STEADILY ALONG THE PATH HE HAD WISELY CHOSEN THOUGH IT WAS BY NO MEANS STREWN WITH FLOWERS
THERE WAS HOPE THAT OTHERS MIGHT ALSO ESCAPE THOUGH THE GALE HAD SENT TWO TO THE BOTTOM A SWIFT SAILING STEAMER HAD BROUGHT THESE SCANTY NEWS AND HAPPIER ONES MIGHT COME AT ANY HOUR BUT KIND FRANZ HAD NOT ADDED THAT THE SAILORS REPORTED THE CAPTAIN'S BOAT AS UNDOUBTEDLY WRECKED BY THE FALLING MAST
THEN TOO HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO CONSTITUTE HIMSELF A HOSTILE ARMY OR A BAND OF MARAUDING INDIANS ON THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE NOTICE IN BRIEF A DISTINCTLY ABLE MAN WITH TALENTS SO FAR AS WE COULD JUDGE IMMENSELY ABOVE THE MAJORITY
SOME ONE OF US HAD HAD PRESENTS AND PRETTY CONVENTIONAL SPEECHES AND HAD GLOWED WITH THAT SENSE OF HEROISM WHICH IS NO LESS SWEET THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO DESERVE IT BUT THE HOLIDAY WAS FOR ALL THE RAPTURE OF AWAKENING NATURE FOR ALL
THEY WERE FREE TO ISSUE FORTH AND BUY GUNPOWDER IN THE FULL EYE OF THE SUN FREE TO FIRE CANNONS AND EXPLODE MINES ON THE LAWN YET THEY NEVER DID ANY ONE OF THESE THINGS NO IRRESISTIBLE ENERGY HALED THEM TO CHURCH O SUNDAYS
WHEN HE THOUGHT OF IT DAN FELT AS IF HE COULD NOT WAIT BUT MUST BURST THAT NARROW CELL AND FLY AWAY AS THE CADDIS WORMS HE USED TO WATCH BY THE BROOKSIDE SHED THEIR STONY COFFINS TO CLIMB THE FERNS AND SOAR INTO THE SKY NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE LULLED HIMSELF TO SLEEP WITH PLANNING HOW
HE BEAT THE UNICORN OBSERVED HAROLD DUBIOUSLY ALL ROUND THE TOWN THAT PROVES HE WAS A GOOD LION CRIED EDWARDS TRIUMPHANTLY BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU TO TELL EM WHEN YOU SEE EM I SHOULD ASK MARTHA SAID HAROLD OF THE SIMPLE CREED
FLASHED THE COLOUR BACK TRUE AND BRILLIANT AND THE SOFT AIR THRILLED WITH THE GERMINATING TOUCH THAT SEEMED TO KINDLE SOMETHING IN MY OWN SMALL PERSON AS WELL AS IN THE RASH PRIMROSE ALREADY LURKING IN SHELTERED HAUNTS OUT INTO THE BRIMMING SUN BATHED WORLD I SPED FREE OF LESSONS
THERE WAS GREAT SCRUBBING AND DUSTING AMONG THE MATRONS AS THEY SET THEIR HOUSES IN ORDER NOT ONLY FOR CLASS DAY BUT TO RECEIVE THE BRIDE AND GROOM WHO WERE TO COME TO THEM FOR THE HONEYMOON TRIP GREAT PLANS WERE MADE GIFTS PREPARED AND MUCH JOY FELT AT THE PROSPECT OF SEEING FRANZ AGAIN
SO HE WALKED UNDER THE LINDENS WITH A LIGHTER HEART AND IN THE MAY EVENINGS WENT ABOUT THE CITY WITH A BAND OF STROLLING STUDENTS MAKING MUSIC BEFORE HOUSES WHERE HE USED TO SIT AS GUEST
YET THEY WENT THERE REGULARLY OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THOUGH THEY BETRAYED NO GREATER DELIGHT IN THE EXPERIENCE THAN OURSELVES ON THE WHOLE THE EXISTENCE OF THESE OLYMPIANS SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY VOID OF INTERESTS

THE PANT AND SMOKE OF A DISTANT TRAIN ALL WERE WINE OR SONG WAS IT OR ODOUR THIS UNITY THEY ALL BLENDED INTO I HAD NO WORDS THEN TO DESCRIBE IT THAT EARTH EFFLUENCE OF WHICH I WAS SO CONSCIOUS NOR INDEED HAVE I FOUND WORDS SINCE
THEN UP WENT THE FLAG OUT RANG THE COLLEGE BELLS BANG WENT TEDDY'S LONG UNUSED CANNON AND A CHORUS OF HAPPY VOICES CRIED THANK GOD AS PEOPLE WENT ABOUT LAUGHING CRYING AND EMBRACING ONE ANOTHER IN A RAPTURE OF DELIGHT
AND ONCE MINNA THREW HIM MONEY WHICH HE HUMBLY RECEIVED AS PART OF HIS PENANCE BEING MORBID ON THE SUBJECT OF HIS SINS HIS REWARD CAME SOONER THAN HE EXPECTED AND WAS GREATER THAN HE DESERVED HE THOUGHT THOUGH HIS HEART LEAPED WITH JOY WHEN HIS MASTER ONE DAY INFORMED HIM
SEAMED MAKING A STITCH AT THE BEGINNING THIRD ROW MAKE ONE KNIT ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT TWO MAKE ONE KNIT THREE MAKE ONE KNIT TWO
AND SITTING BY HER GOOD MAN HEARD ALL THAT THERE WAS TO TELL TIDINGS HAD BEEN SENT TO THE SHIPOWNERS AT HAMBURG BY SOME OF THE SURVIVORS AND TELEGRAPHED AT ONCE BY FRANZ TO HIS UNCLE AS ONE BOAT LOAD WAS SAFE
AND THE AGE OF ACORNS HAVE DISPLACED OUR HARD WON CIVILISATION
AND I FELT SURE AS I RAMBLED OFF IN HIS WAKE THAT HE HAD MORE HOLIDAY MATTER TO SHOW ME AND SO INDEED HE HAD AND ALL OF IT WAS TO THE SAME LAWLESS TUNE LIKE A BLACK PIRATE FLAG ON THE BLUE OCEAN OF AIR A HAWK HUNG OMINOUS THEN PLUMMET WISE DROPPED TO THE HEDGEROW
TWENTIETH ROW SEAMED MAKE ONE AT THE BEGINNING TWENTY FIRST ROW SAME AS ELEVENTH
TEDDY STOOD ON HIS HEAD LITERALLY AND TORE ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ON OCTOO LIKE A SECOND PAUL REVERE ONLY HIS TIDINGS WERE GOOD BUT BEST OF ALL LITTLE JOSIE LIFTED UP HER HEAD AS THE SNOWDROPS DID AND BEGAN TO BLOOM AGAIN GROWING TALL AND QUIET
HAD THEY ALL BEEN TRUE THE ELDERS BORE IT QUIETLY HAVING LEARNED SUBMISSION IN LIFE'S HARD SCHOOL BUT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE REBELLED SOME HOPED AGAINST HOPE AND KEPT UP OTHERS DESPAIRED AT ONCE AND LITTLE JOSIE EMIL'S PET COUSIN AND PLAYMATE WAS SO BROKEN HEARTED
CHAPTER FIFTEEN WAITING
I SEEMED TO DISCERN FAINTLY A SOMETHING OF THE STERN MEANING IN HER VALOROUS CHANT MY INVISIBLE COMPANION WAS SINGING ALSO AND SEEMED AT TIMES TO BE CHUCKLING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF DOUBTLESS AT THOUGHT OF THE STRANGE NEW LESSONS HE WAS TEACHING ME
THAN THE KINDLY BEASTS WHO SHARED OUR NATURAL EXISTENCE IN THE SUN THE ESTRANGEMENT WAS FORTIFIED BY AN ABIDING SENSE OF INJUSTICE
AS BEST MAN HE COULD NOT REFUSE THE NEW SUIT FRANZ INSISTED ON ORDERING FOR HIM AND A CHEQUE FROM HOME ABOUT THAT TIME MADE HIM FEEL LIKE A MILLIONAIRE AND A HAPPY ONE FOR THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH KIND LETTERS FULL OF DELIGHT IN HIS SUCCESS
AND BE LIKE THE SELF SACRIFICING HEROINES SHE LOVED TO ACT
DO SHOUTED EDWARD VALIANTLY I SHOULD I SHOULD I SHOULD
SILENTLY SUBMITTING AS WAS OUR WONT WITH MORE CONTEMPT THAN ANGER ANON WITH UNCTUOUS HAIR AND FACES STIFFENED IN A CONVENTIONAL GRIN

DOLLY AND GEORGE CAME OFTEN BEARING THE LOVELIEST FLOWERS AND THE DAINTIEST BON BONS TO CHEER MISSUS BHAER AND SWEETEN JOSIE'S GRIEF WHILE GOOD HEARTED NED TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY FROM CHICAGO TO PRESS THEIR HANDS AND SAY WITH A TEAR IN HIS EYE
JUBILANT AS EVER HER SONG WENT BUBBLING ON AND DEATH IN LIFE AND AGAIN LIFE IN DEATH WERE ITS ALTERNATE BURDENS AND LOOKING ROUND AND SEEING THE SHEEP NIBBLED HEELS OF TURNIPS THAT DOTTED THE GROUND THEIR HEARTS EATEN OUT OF THEM IN FROST BOUND DAYS NOW OVER AND DONE
AT EACH STEP GROWING LESS CHARLOTTE THE MUMMER OF A MINUTE AND MORE THE ANXIOUS PILGRIM OF ALL TIME THE LION'S WRATH WAXED TERRIBLE AT HER APPROACH HIS ROARING FILLED THE STARTLED AIR
WITH THE SHADOW OF PAST SORROW TO TONE DOWN HER FORMER VIVACITY AND SHOW THAT SHE HAD LEARNED A LESSON IN TRYING TO ACT WELL HER PART ON THE REAL STAGE WHERE ALL HAVE TO TAKE THEIR SHARE IN THE GREAT DRAMA OF LIFE
BY THE BACK DOOR HE HAD RENDERED UP HIS DUCKWEED BEDABBLED PERSON INTO THE HANDS OF AN AUNT AND HAD BEEN PROMPTLY SENT OFF TO BED AND THIS ON A HOLIDAY WAS VERY MUCH
INTO THE VACANT MEADOW SPACES
THEN I PASSED ON MY WAY I PROTEST I WAS NOT ON BILL'S SIDE BUT THEN NEITHER WAS I ON THE VICAR'S
SO WE SHEERED OFF TOGETHER ARM IN ARM SO TO SPEAK AND WITH FULLEST CONFIDENCE I TOOK THE JIGGING THWARTWISE COURSE MY CHAINLESS PILOT LAID FOR ME A WHIMSICAL COMRADE I FOUND HIM ERE HE HAD DONE WITH ME
I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO HEAR ALL ABOUT THE DEAR OLD BOY I COULDN'T KEEP AWAY THAT'S RIGHT COMFORTABLE AND SHOWS ME THAT IF I DIDN'T TEACH MY BOYS ANYTHING ELSE I DID GIVE THEM THE BROTHERLY LOVE THAT WILL MAKE THEM STAND BY ONE ANOTHER ALL THEIR LIVES SAID MISSUS JO WHEN HE HAD GONE
IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AWAKENINGS OF THE YEAR THE EARTH STRETCHED HERSELF SMILING IN HER SLEEP AND EVERYTHING LEAPT AND PULSED TO THE STIR OF THE GIANT'S MOVEMENT WITH US IT WAS A WHOLE HOLIDAY THE OCCASION A BIRTHDAY IT MATTERS NOT WHOSE
AND CHEERED HIM UP WHEN HEIMWEH AND WEARINESS MADE HIM SAD AS SPRING CAME ON THINGS MENDED EXPENSES GREW LESS WORK PLEASANTER AND LIFE MORE BEARABLE THAN WHEN WINTRY STORMS BEAT ON HIS THINLY CLAD BACK
HOW RELIEVED WHEN HAVING HONESTLY CONFESSED HIS SHORTCOMINGS THEY ONLY LAUGHED AND OWNED THAT THEY ALSO HAD KNOWN LIKE EXPERIENCES AND WERE THE WISER FOR THEM HE WAS TO GO TO THE WEDDING LATE IN JUNE AND JOIN HIS COMRADES IN LONDON
AND FROST PINCHED THE TOES THAT PATIENTLY TRUDGED IN OLD BOOTS NO DEBTS BURDENED HIM THE YEAR OF ABSENCE WAS NEARLY OVER AND IF HE CHOSE TO STAY HERR BERGMANN HAD HOPES FOR HIM THAT WOULD BRING INDEPENDENCE FOR A TIME AT LEAST
WHENCE THERE ROSE THIN AND SHRILL A PITEOUS VOICE OF SQUEALING BY THE TIME I GOT THERE A WHISK OF FEATHERS ON THE TURF LIKE SCATTERED PLAYBILLS WAS ALL THAT REMAINED TO TELL OF THE TRAGEDY JUST ENACTED YET NATURE SMILED AND SANG ON PITILESS GAY IMPARTIAL
OH HE'S JUST PLAYIN MUFFIN MAN AS USUAL SAID CHARLOTTE WITH PETULANCE FANCY WANTING TO BE A MUFFIN MAN ON A WHOLE HOLIDAY IT WAS A STRANGE CRAZE CERTAINLY BUT HAROLD WHO INVENTED HIS OWN GAMES AND PLAYED THEM WITHOUT ASSISTANCE
KNIT THREE MAKE ONE KNIT ONE MAKE ONE KNIT THREE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT REMAINDER TWELFTH ROW SEAMED MAKE ONE AT THE BEGINNING
AS THE GREAT BERGMANN SELDOM PRAISED HIS PUPILS THESE WORDS FILLED NAT'S SOUL WITH PRIDE AND JOY AND HE WORKED YET MORE DILIGENTLY THAN BEFORE TO FULFIL HIS MASTER'S PROPHECY HE THOUGHT THE TRIP TO ENGLAND HAPPINESS ENOUGH BUT FOUND ROOM FOR MORE WHEN EARLY IN JUNE
THANKS TO THE FAITHFUL FRIEND WHO HAD STOOD BY HIM ALL THAT BITTER YEAR SOON HE WAS TO BE FREE AGAIN WORN AND SCARRED IN THE FRAY
SOME REGRET FOR FAULTS THAT LIE HEAVY ON THE CONSCIENCE WHEN THE ONE SINNED AGAINST IS GONE AND ALL OF THEM THE SOLEMN LESSON TO BE READY WHEN THE SUMMONS COMES A HUSH LAY OVER PLUMFIELD FOR WEEKS AND THE STUDIOUS FACES ON THE HILL REFLECTED THE SADNESS OF THOSE IN THE VALLEY
AND WHISKED HER OVER THE SNOWY ROADS AT A PACE WHICH SET THE BLOOD DANCING IN HER VEINS AND SENT HER HOME STRENGTHENED AND COMFORTED BY SUNSHINE FRESH AIR AND CONGENIAL SOCIETY THREE AIDS YOUNG SUFFERERS SELDOM CAN RESIST

EVEN WHEN HOPE WAXED FAINT AND HER HEART WAS HEAVY IF ANYTHING COULD COMFORT THE BHAERS FOR THE LOSS OF ONE BOY
AND THE OLD FREE LIFE WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE FROM THE TEMPTATIONS THAT BESET HIM IN CITIES BY AND BY WHEN I'M ALL RIGHT AGAIN AND HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL THAT I'M NOT ASHAMED OF I'LL GO HOME HE SAID WITH A QUICKER BEAT OF THE IMPETUOUS HEART THAT LONGED TO BE THERE SO INTENSELY
WELL THE OLYMPIANS ARE ALL PAST AND GONE SOMEHOW THE SUN DOES NOT SEEM TO SHINE SO BRIGHTLY AS IT USED THE TRACKLESS MEADOWS OF OLD TIME HAVE SHRUNK AND DWINDLED AWAY TO A FEW POOR ACRES
HOW PROUD HE WAS TO TELL HIS PLANS ASSURE THEM THAT HE HAD NO DEBTS AND RECEIVE THEIR PRAISES FOR HIS IMPROVEMENT IN MUSIC THEIR RESPECT FOR HIS ECONOMY AND STEADFASTNESS IN WELL DOING
BUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT ON THIS DAY OF DAYS EVEN A GRIZZLY FELT MISPLACED AND COMMON SURE ENOUGH AN UNDENIABLE BEAR SPRANG OUT ON US AS WE DROPPED INTO THE ROAD THEN ENSUED SHRIEKS GROWLINGS REVOLVER SHOTS AND UNRECORDED HEROISMS
I RAN SIDEWAYS SHOUTING I DUG GLAD HEELS INTO THE SQUELCHING SOIL I SPLASHED DIAMOND SHOWERS FROM PUDDLES WITH A STICK I HURLED CLODS SKYWARDS AT RANDOM AND PRESENTLY I SOMEHOW FOUND MYSELF SINGING
THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION IN THE CURATE WHO WOULD RECEIVE UNBLENCHING THE INFORMATION THAT THE MEADOW BEYOND THE ORCHARD WAS A PRAIRIE STUDDED WITH HERDS OF BUFFALO WHICH IT WAS OUR DELIGHT MOCCASINED AND TOMAHAWKED TO RIDE DOWN WITH THOSE WHOOPS THAT ANNOUNCE THE SCENTING OF BLOOD
SAID PROFESSOR BHAER COMING IN ONE DAY EARLY IN JANUARY PLEASE TELL IT AT ONCE I CAN'T BEAR TO WAIT FRITZ CRIED MISSUS JO DROPPING HER WORK AND STANDING UP AS IF TO TAKE THE SHOT BRAVELY BUT WE MUST WAIT AND HOPE HEART'S DEAREST COME
FOR MISSUS JO CARRIED THEM IN HER POCKET WHEN MISTER BHAER DID NOT HAVE THEM IN HIS AND BOTH TOOK A LOOK AT THEM WHEN THEY SAID THEIR PRAYERS AT NIGHT NOW THE PROFESSOR WAS HEARD HUMMING LIKE A BIG BEE AGAIN AS HE WENT TO HIS CLASSES
QUITE THORNY WAS IT IN FACT AND HARD TO TRAVEL AFTER THE TASTE OF EASE AND PLEASURE HE HAD GOT WHEN NIBBLING AT FORBIDDEN FRUIT BUT HIS CROP OF WILD OATS WAS A LIGHT ONE AND HE RESOLUTELY REAPED WHAT HE HAD SOWED FINDING SOME GOOD WHEAT AMONG THE TARES HE TAUGHT BY DAY
THAT HE WAS CHOSEN WITH SEVERAL OTHER OF HIS MOST PROMISING PUPILS TO JOIN THE MUSICAL SOCIETY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PART IN THE GREAT FESTIVAL IN LONDON THE NEXT JULY HERE WAS NOT ONLY HONOUR FOR THE VIOLINIST BUT HAPPINESS FOR THE MAN AS IT BROUGHT HIM NEARER HOME
KNIT THOSE LEFT AT THE END SIXTEENTH ROW SEAMED MAKE ONE AT THE BEGINNING SEVENTEENTH ROW MAKE ONE KNIT THREE KNIT TWO TOGETHER MAKE ONE
I TRUST HE IS A BISHOP BY THIS TIME HE HAD ALL THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS AS WE KNEW THESE STRANGE FOLK HAD VISITORS SOMETIMES STIFF AND COLOURLESS OLYMPIANS LIKE THEMSELVES EQUALLY WITHOUT VITAL INTERESTS AND INTELLIGENT PURSUITS
KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT TWO FOURTH ROW SEAMED MAKING ONE AT THE BEGINNING FIFTH ROW MAKE ONE KNIT TWO KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT ONE MAKE ONE

THE MASTERFUL WIND WAS UP AND OUT SHOUTING AND CHASING THE LORD OF THE MORNING POPLARS SWAYED AND TOSSED WITH A ROARING SWISH DEAD LEAVES SPRANG ALOFT AND WHIRLED INTO SPACE AND ALL THE CLEAR SWEPT HEAVEN SEEMED TO THRILL WITH SOUND LIKE A GREAT HARP
THE VARIOUS OUTDOOR JOYS OF PUDDLES AND SUN AND HEDGE BREAKING FOR ALL COLT LIKE I RAN THROUGH THE MEADOWS FRISKING HAPPY HEELS IN THE FACE OF NATURE LAUGHING RESPONSIVE ABOVE THE SKY WAS BLUEST OF THE BLUE WIDE POOLS LEFT BY THE WINTER'S FLOODS
KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT ONE MAKE ONE KNIT FIVE MAKE ONE KNIT ONE
OR TO HUNT BEARS AMONG THE HAZELS IT WAS INCESSANT MATTER FOR AMAZEMENT HOW THESE OLYMPIANS WOULD TALK OVER OUR HEADS DURING MEALS FOR INSTANCE OF THIS OR THE OTHER SOCIAL OR POLITICAL INANITY
AS HE REMEMBERED WHAT IT HAD DONE SINCE A CERTAIN LITTLE WHITE HAND HAD LAID IN IT CONFIDINGLY I'LL MAKE EM PROUD OF ME YET AND NO ONE SHALL EVER KNOW OF THIS AWFUL YEAR I CAN WIPE IT OUT AND I WILL SO HELP ME GOD
A SORRY SIGHT FOR ONE THAT HAD KNOWN THE FELLOW IN MORE BUSTLING CIRCUMSTANCES NATURE MIGHT AT LEAST HAVE PAUSED TO SHED ONE TEAR OVER THIS ROUGH JACKETED LITTLE SON OF HERS FOR HIS WASTED AIMS HIS CANCELLED AMBITIONS HIS WHOLE CAREER OF USEFULNESS CUT SUDDENLY SHORT BUT NOT A BIT OF IT
BUT ONLY A CERTAIN BLEND OF ENVY OF THEIR GOOD LUCK AND PITY FOR THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE USE OF IT INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST HOPELESS FEATURES IN THEIR CHARACTER WHEN WE TROUBLED OURSELVES TO WASTE A THOUGHT ON THEM WHICH WASN'T OFTEN
TO PASS ALONG BUSY STREETS OF YOUR OWN BUILDING FOR EVER RINGING AN IMAGINARY BELL AND OFFERING AIRY MUFFINS OF YOUR OWN MAKE TO A BUSTLING THRONGING CROWD OF YOUR OWN CREATION THERE WERE POINTS ABOUT THE GAME IT CANNOT BE DENIED THOUGH IT SEEMED SCARCE IN HARMONY WITH THIS RADIANT WIND SWEPT MORNING
AND OFFERING PHANTOM MUFFINS TO INVISIBLE WAYFARERS
WHILE THERE GREW UP IN ME AS IN THE PARALLEL CASE OF CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS A VAGUE SENSE OF A RULING POWER WILFUL AND FREAKISH AND PRONE TO THE PRACTICE OF VAGARIES JUST CHOOSING SO
TO HER WHO TOOK NO SIDES THERE WAS EVERY BIT AS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR THE HAWK AS FOR THE CHAFFINCH BOTH WERE HER CHILDREN AND SHE WOULD SHOW NO PREFERENCES FURTHER ON A HEDGEHOG LAY DEAD ATHWART THE PATH NAY MORE THAN DEAD DECADENT DISTINCTLY
MAKE ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT THREE MAKE ONE KNIT ONE MAKE ONE KNIT THREE
AND HAVING ENFORCED HER ORDERS WITH THE MOST AWFUL THREATS IN CASE OF DISOBEDIENCE SHE VANISHED LEAVING THE LITTLE GIRL AT LIBERTY TO EXPLORE THE PALACE
AND INTENDED SETTING OUT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY INTO THE WIDE WORLD IN SEARCH OF THE MAID SO THE NEXT MORNING THE PRINCE MOUNTED HIS FINE HORSE AND LEFT HIS HOME
WHEN TO HIS JOY AND WONDER HE SAW FOLLOWING HIM IN ANOTHER CANOE EXACTLY LIKE HIS OWN THE MAIDEN FOR WHOSE SAKE HE HAD MADE THIS LONG JOURNEY BUT THEY COULD NOT TOUCH EACH OTHER FOR BETWEEN THEM ROLLED GREAT WAVES WHICH LOOKED AS IF THEY WOULD SINK THE BOATS
AND ADDED TO IT ALL SHE HAD THREE HEADS HER APPEARANCE WAS A GREAT SHOCK TO THE PRINCE AND SO WAS HER VOICE WHICH WAS LIKE THE CROAKING OF MANY RAVENS SHE ASKED HIM
AT THE GATE MY MESSENGER AWAITS YOU AND YOU SHALL TAKE AGAIN
ONLY THE CHILDREN HAD NO FEAR AND REACHED THE OTHER SIDE IN SAFETY STILL THOUGH THE CHIEF AND THE YOUNG GIRL QUAILED IN TERROR AT THESE HORRIBLE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS NO HARM CAME TO THEM FOR THEIR LIVES HAD BEEN FREE FROM EVIL
THE RAINBOW APPEARED AS CLEARLY AS IT HAD EVER DONE IN THE FOUNTAIN BY THIS MEANS THEY WERE ABLE TO MEET WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE FIRE OR OF THE TWO BOTTLES IN WHICH THE OLD FAIRY KEPT HER EYE AND HER TOOTH AT NIGHT
SHE WAS ALSO SO SPITEFUL THAT SHE GLADLY DEVOTED ALL HER TIME TO CARRYING OUT ALL THE MEAN OR ILL NATURED TRICKS OF THE WHOLE BODY OF FAIRIES WITH HER LARGE EXPERIENCE ADDED TO HER NATIVE SPITE
SEVERAL YEARS PASSED DURING WHICH TIME THE PRINCESS GREW ACCUSTOMED TO HER LONELY LIFE OBEYED THE FAIRY'S ORDERS AND BY DEGREES FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE COURT OF THE KING HER FATHER
ONE OF THE OLD MEN SAY THAT THE LAND OF SOULS LAY TO THE SOUTH AND SO FILLED WITH NEW HOPE AND COURAGE HE SET HIS FACE SOUTHWARDS FOR MANY MANY MILES THE COUNTRY LOOKED THE SAME AS IT DID ROUND HIS OWN HOME
AND FOR SOME TIME THE LOVERS ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF SUNSHINE TOGETHER ONE DAY PRINCE RAINBOW APPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF WOE HE HAD JUST HEARD THAT HE WAS TO BE BANISHED FROM THIS LOVELY SPOT BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS TO GO
ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN I AM A VERY POOR WOMAN AND SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT I SET OUT FOR THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN IN ORDER TO SELL MY EGGS IN THE MARKET ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING BUT I LOST MY WAY IN THE DARK
AND HOW HE HAD HEARD FROM HIS OWN LIPS THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE THEN THEY WERE ALL DELIGHTED AND IN HIGH SPIRITS TOOK OUT THEIR WHIP AND CRACKED SO MUCH MONEY THAT IT CAME JUMPING UP FROM THE GROUND WHEN THE SEVEN YEARS HAD QUITE GONE THE FIEND CAME WITH HIS BOOK AND
THE PRINCE THANKED HIM FOR HIS INFORMATION AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY FOR A WHOLE YEAR ALONG THE SAME ROAD AND AT THE END OF IT CAME TO THE LITTLE HUT WHERE HE FOUND A VERY OLD MAN
THE PRINCE AND SHE FLEW LIKE THE WIND TILL THEY REACHED THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DWELLING BUT THE DRAGONS HAD NOTICED THEIR FLIGHT AND WOKE THEIR BROTHER OUT OF HIS YEAR'S SLEEP HE FLEW INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE WHEN HE HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED
BUT GREW LESS AND LESS THE FARTHER HE WENT SOUTH TILL IT DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER SOON THE TREES PUT FORTH THEIR BUDS AND FLOWERS SPRANG UP UNDER HIS FEET AND INSTEAD OF THICK CLOUDS THERE WAS BLUE SKY OVER HIS HEAD AND EVERYWHERE THE BIRDS WERE SINGING
AND EATING ANY YOUNG GIRLS OUR HEROINE OBEYED WITH GREAT SWEETNESS AND WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER LOVER
WITH DIAMOND WINDOWS HE OPENED THE BIG GATE LEADING INTO THE COURTYARD
SHE SAID TO HIM YOU ARE A BRAVE YOUTH AND I WILL MAKE YOU MY BODY SERVANT BUT WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU AS A REWARD TO BEGIN WITH
HE REMEMBERED HAVING HEARD FROM THE OLD OLD PEOPLE OF THE TRIBE THAT THERE WAS A PATH THAT LED TO THE LAND OF SOULS THAT IF YOU SOUGHT CAREFULLY YOU COULD FIND IT
HE ASKED HIM THE SAME QUESTION AND THE OLD MAN ANSWERED NO
HE NO LONGER SIGHED FOR FREEDOM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND LEARNED TO LOVE FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HE ADDED MANY OTHER TENDER SPEECHES TO THIS DECLARATION AND THE PRINCESS TO WHOM SUCH REMARKS WERE A NEW EXPERIENCE
VERY WELL
THE PRINCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY ROUSED BUT HE OPENED HIS EYES A LITTLE AND LOOKED ALL THE HANDSOMER IMPATIENT AT NOT BEING RECOGNISED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY NOW DREW OUT HER THIRD PRESENT AND ON OPENING THE CRYSTAL SCENT BOTTLE A LITTLE SYREN FLEW OUT
ONE OF THEM SAID TO THE OTHERS IF WE ARE CAUGHT WE SHALL BE HANGED ON THE GALLOWS HOW SHALL WE SET ABOUT IT THE OTHER SAID DO YOU SEE THAT LARGE CORNFIELD THERE
AT THE SAME TIME GIVING HER THE STRICTEST ORDERS NEVER TO LET OUT THE FIRE WHICH WAS BURNING BRIGHTLY IN THE GRATE SHE THEN GAVE TWO GLASS BOTTLES INTO THE PRINCESS'S CHARGE DESIRING HER TO TAKE THE GREATEST CARE OF THEM
SHE NOTICED THAT THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PRODUCE A BRILLIANT RAINBOW SHE STOOD STILL TO ADMIRE IT WHEN TO HER GREAT SURPRISE SHE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESSING HER WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE CENTRE OF ITS RAYS
THEN HE PUT A BOOK BEFORE THEM WHICH HE MADE ALL THREE OF THEM SIGN I WILL THEN GIVE YOU A RIDDLE HE SAID IF YOU GUESS IT YOU SHALL BE FREE AND OUT OF MY POWER THE DRAGON THEN FLEW AWAY
THE POOR YOUNG COUPLE WERE IN DESPAIR AND ONLY PARTED WITH THE LAST RAY OF SUNSHINE AND IN HOPES OF MEETING NEXT MORNING ALAS NEXT DAY WAS DARK AND GLOOMY AND IT WAS ONLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS FOR A FEW MINUTES
THEY ENTERED THE CASTLE AND WALKED THROUGH TWELVE SPLENDID HALLS ALL MADE OF GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE TWELFTH ROOM THEY FOUND THE MOTHER DRAGON SEATED ON A DIAMOND THRONE SHE WAS THE
STARTED OFF AT ONCE TAKING NOTHING WITH HER BUT HER DOG HER CAT A SPRIG OF MYRTLE AND THE STONE WHICH THE WIFE OF LOCRINOS GAVE HER WHEN LAGREE BECAME AWARE OF HER PRISONER'S FLIGHT
IT WAS THE ONLY CHANCE OF SEEING HER LOVER BEFORE THEY WERE SEPARATED AND SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO BREAK THE BOTTLE AND POUR THEIR CONTENTS INTO THE BASIN WHEN THE RAINBOW APPEARED AT ONCE THEIR FAREWELLS WERE FULL OF TENDERNESS
YOU EVER SAW THE PRINCESS CLIMBED UP ONE OF THE SILVER CHAINS HOLDING IN HER HAND THE LITTLE PORTER WHO IN SPITE OF HIS MINUTE SIZE OPENED A SECRET DOOR WITH HIS GOLDEN KEY AND LET HER IN
AT THE WATER WHICH LIES FAR OUT YONDER AND THE PLAINS WHICH STRETCH BEYOND
IF YOU WOULD HELP YOURSELVES ONE OF YOU MUST GO INTO THE WOOD AND THERE HE WILL COME UPON A TUMBLE DOWN BUILDING OF ROCKS WHICH LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE HOUSE HE MUST GO IN AND THERE HE WILL FIND HELP THE TWO MELANCHOLY ONES THOUGHT
SHE GAVE HER A NUT DESIRING HER ONLY TO OPEN IT IN THE MOST URGENT NEED AFTER A LONG AND TIRING JOURNEY FAIRER THAN A FAIRY WAS ONCE MORE RECEIVED IN A HOUSE AND BY A LADY EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE SHE
IF WE WERE TO HIDE OURSELVES IN THAT NO ONE COULD FIND US THE ARMY CANNOT COME INTO IT AND TO MORROW IT IS TO MARCH ON THEY CREPT INTO THE CORN BUT THE ARMY DID NOT MARCH ON BUT REMAINED ENCAMPED CLOSE AROUND THEM
CHARMS WOULD WIN ALL HEARTS WHEN THE THREE GREEN AND WHITE SISTERS APPEARED THEY DECLARED THE SECRET OF FAIRY THAN A FAIRY'S ROYAL BIRTH AND THE QUEEN TAKING THE TWO LOVERS IN HER CARRIAGE SET OFF WITH THEM FOR THE CAPITAL OF THE KINGDOM
THAN THEY RESOLVED TO GAIN POSSESSION OF HER WHO BORE IT AND EITHER TO TORMENT HER CRUELLY OR AT LEAST TO CONCEAL HER FROM THE EYES OF ALL MEN THE ELDEST OF THEIR TRIBE WAS ENTRUSTED TO CARRY OUT THEIR REVENGE THIS FAIRY WAS NAMED LAGREE
CONVENIENT WAY OF MEETING THAN BY THE GARDEN FOUNTAIN AND FAIRER THAN A FAIRY CARRIED OUT HIS PLAN DAILY WITH ENTIRE SUCCESS EVERY MORNING SHE PLACED A LARGE BASIN FULL OF WATER ON HER WINDOW SILL AND AS SOON AS THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER
THE BALL CAME TO AN END AT MIDNIGHT AND EARLY NEXT MORNING THE PRINCE AGAIN LED THE MOTHER DRAGON'S MARE OUT INTO THE MEADOW BUT AGAIN SHE VANISHED BEFORE HIS EYES THEN HE TOOK OUT HIS LITTLE BELL AND RANG IT TWICE
WHO NOW SAW HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS REAL SHAPE
LAGREE ON HER RETURN SOON FOUND OUT THE NEGLECT AND SEEMED ONLY TOO PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HER SPITE TO HER LOVELY PRISONER
SHE FLEW AT LAGREE'S FACE AND TORE OUT HER ONLY EYE THUS DELIVERING THE PRINCESS FOR EVER FROM HER PERSECUTOR
REST IN MY HUT AS SHE ALSO RESTED AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU ASK AND WHITHER YOU SHOULD GO ON HEARING THESE WORDS THE YOUNG MAN ENTERED THE HUT BUT HIS HEART WAS TOO EAGER WITHIN HIM
TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND AN OLD WOMAN WHO BEGGED HIM TO HELP HER OUT OF THE DITCH THE PRINCE BENT DOWN AND LIFTED HER OUT OF HER LIVING GRAVE ASKING HER AT THE SAME TIME HOW SHE HAD MANAGED TO GET THERE MY SON
VERY SOON HE NOTICED WITH WONDER THAT NEITHER ROCKS NOR TREES BARRED HIS PATH HE PASSED THROUGH THEM WITHOUT KNOWING IT FOR INDEED THEY WERE NOT ROCKS AND TREES AT ALL BUT ONLY THE SOULS OF THEM FOR THIS WAS THE LAND OF SHADOWS
JUST WAIT A MOMENT AND I WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING AND SHE DISAPPEARED INTO HER HUT BUT RETURNED VERY SOON AND SAID YOU ARE A MIGHTY PRINCE BUT AT THE SAME
FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THANKED HER WARMLY AND RESUMED HER WAY CHEERED BY PLEASANT THOUGHTS AFTER A TIME HER ROAD LED THROUGH A WOOD FULL OF SOFT AIRS AND SWEET ODOURS AND BEFORE SHE HAD GONE A HUNDRED YARDS SHE SAW A WONDERFUL SILVER CASTLE
BUT NO SOONER HAD LAGREE BEEN PUT TO FIGHT THAN OUR HEROINE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HUNGER AND THIRST SHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE SHOULD CERTAINLY EXPIRE AND IT WAS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY THAT SHE DRAGGED HERSELF AS FAR
SHE TOOK THE BIRD'S ADVICE AND IN DUE TIME ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF LOCRINOS LUCKILY SHE ONLY FOUND HIS WIFE AT HOME WHO WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE PRINCESS'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY AND SWEET GENTLE MANNERS
AFTER THE BALL WE WILL FLY AWAY TOGETHER ON THE THIRD DAY THE PRINCE LED THE MARE TO THE MEADOW AGAIN BUT ONCE MORE SHE VANISHED BEFORE HIS EYES THEN THE PRINCE TOOK OUT HIS LITTLE BELL AND RANG IT THREE TIMES
TO SUFFER HIM TO REST AND WHEN HE AROSE THE OLD MAN ROSE TOO AND STOOD WITH HIM AT THE DOOR LOOK HE SAID
AND LASTED TILL THE APPROACH OF WINTER WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER WENT BACK AGAIN TO HER MOTHER
AND DETERMINED TO LAY SIEGE TO THE FLOWER QUEEN'S PALACE BUT THE QUEEN CAUSED A FOREST OF FLOWERS AS HIGH AS THE SKY TO GROW UP ROUND HER DWELLING THROUGH WHICH NO ONE COULD FORCE A WAY
FAR AWAY IN NORTH AMERICA WHERE THE RED INDIANS DWELL
AND ON THE TOP OF THESE HE FOUND A HUT OR WIGWAM AN OLD MAN CLOTHED IN SKINS AND HOLDING A STAFF IN HIS HAND STOOD IN THE DOORWAY
SHE FELT A LITTLE REASSURED AND WAS FURTHER CHEERED WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT HER PET CAT AND DOG HAD FOLLOWED HER
THE VOICE WAS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN AND ITS SWEETNESS OF TONE AND THE AGREEABLE THINGS IT UTTERED LED ONE TO INFER THAT ITS OWNER MUST BE EQUALLY CHARMING BUT THIS HAD TO BE A MERE MATTER OF FANCY FOR NO ONE WAS VISIBLE
POINTING AT THE SIGNATURES SAID I WILL TAKE YOU UNDERGROUND WITH ME YOU SHALL HAVE A MEAL THERE IF YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT YOU WILL GET FOR YOUR ROAST MEAT YOU SHALL BE FREE
HERE AGAIN SHE RECEIVED A PRESENT WITH THE SAME INJUNCTIONS
THEN SAID THE FIRST SOLDIER
WE WILL EAT YOU UP THE PRINCE UNDERTOOK THE TASK AND LED THE MARE OUT TO THE MEADOW
AND THEY JOURNEYED ON WITH THEIR LITTLE WHIP THEY HAD AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY WANTED WORE GRAND CLOTHES AND MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE WORLD WHEREVER THEY WENT THEY LIVED IN MERRYMAKING AND SPLENDOUR DROVE ABOUT WITH HORSES AND CARRIAGES ATE AND DRANK BUT DID NOTHING WRONG
THEY SAT FOR TWO DAYS AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE CORN AND GREW SO HUNGRY THAT THEY NEARLY DIED BUT IF THEY WERE TO VENTURE OUT IT WAS CERTAIN DEATH THEY SAID AT LAST
THE PRINCE MADE THE MOST ARDENT AND SINCERE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISED TO NEGLECT NOTHING WHICH MIGHT HELP TO DELIVER HIS DEAR FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND IMPLORED HER TO CONSENT TO THEIR MARRIAGE AS SOON AS THEY SHOULD BOTH BE FREE
SHE MUST COME AND LIVE WITH ME IN MY PALACE UNDERGROUND THE PRINCE CONSENTED TO THIS AND LED HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE HOME WHERE THE WEDDING WAS HELD WITH GREAT POMP AND MAGNIFICENCE THE YOUNG COUPLE LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER TILL WINTER CAME
BUT NO MAN ENTERS IT WITHOUT LEAVING HIS BODY BEHIND HIM
BUT IN THE MURMUR OF THE WIND HE HEARD THE MASTER OF LIFE SAYING TO HIM RETURN WHITHER YOU CAME FOR I HAVE WORK FOR YOU TO DO AND YOUR PEOPLE NEED YOU AND FOR MANY YEARS YOU SHALL RULE OVER THEM
THE BIRD SAID YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE MOTHER DRAGON'S MARE WHO IS GALLOPING ABOUT AMONG THE CLOUDS I WILL SUMMON ALL THE EAGLES OF THE AIR TOGETHER AND ORDER THEM TO CATCH THE MARE AND BRING HER TO YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS THE KING OF THE EAGLES FLEW AWAY
IN A MOMENT THE KING OF THE FISHES APPEARED AND SAID TO HIM I KNOW QUITE WELL WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO AND I WILL SUMMON ALL THE FISHES OF THE SEA TOGETHER
THE PRINCESS ON HER SIDE VOWED TO HAVE NO OTHER HUSBAND AND DECLARED HERSELF WILLING TO BRAVE DEATH ITSELF IN ORDER TO REJOIN HIM THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED MUCH TIME FOR THEIR ADIEUS THE RAINBOW VANISHED AND THE PRINCESS RESOLVED TO RUN ALL RISKS
AND HIS HORSE HAD DIED OF EXHAUSTION WHILE HE HIMSELF HAD SUFFERED MUCH FROM WANT AND MISERY BUT STILL HE HAD COME ON NO TRACE OF HER HE WAS IN SEARCH OF AT LAST ONE DAY HE CAME TO A HUT IN FRONT OF WHICH SAT A VERY OLD MAN
HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO PRESENT HER TO HIS MOTHER AND THE COURT
SHE GAVE HIM AT THE SAME TIME A CLOAK MADE OF COPPER
SO THE NEXT MORNING HE GOT UP EARLY AND PUT SOME FOOD IN HIS POUCH AND SLUNG AN EXTRA SKIN OVER HIS SHOULDERS FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW LONG HIS JOURNEY WOULD TAKE NOR WHAT SORT OF COUNTRY HE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH ONLY ONE THING HE KNEW
AS TO CERTAIN DEATH AS SHE WAS CROSSING A WOOD A BIRD SANG TO HER TO PICK UP A SHINING PEBBLE WHICH SHE WOULD FIND IN A FOUNTAIN CLOSE BY AND TO USE IT WHEN NEEDED
SO THEY REACHED UNHURT THE SHORE OF THE HAPPY ISLAND AND WANDERED THROUGH THE FLOWERY FIELDS AND BY THE BANKS OF RUSHING STREAMS AND THEY KNEW NOT HUNGER NOR THIRST NEITHER COLD NOR HEAT
WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER DEPARTED AND WENT HOME TO HER MOTHER
ON OPENING IT FOUND THAT ALL THE SEEDS WERE AS MANY LITTLE VIOLINS WHICH FLEW UP IN THE VAULTED ROOF AND AT ONCE BEGAN PLAYING MELODIOUSLY
THE BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW INFORMED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THAT HE WAS YOUNG THE SON OF A POWERFUL KING AND THAT THE FAIRY LAGREE WHO OWED HIS PARENTS A GRUDGE
SHE READILY LET FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAVE THE FIRE
SHE WAS SO OLD THAT SHE ONLY HAD ONE EYE AND ONE TOOTH LEFT
THAT THEY WISHED THEIR HOUSES AND GARMENTS TO BE EQUALLY ALIKE THEIR OCCUPATION CONSISTED IN HELPING THOSE IN MISFORTUNE AND THEY WERE AS GENTLE AND BENEVOLENT AS LAGREE HAD BEEN CRUEL AND SPITEFUL THE THIRD FAIRY COMFORTED THE POOR TRAVELLER
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR WINEGLASS SHALL BE AN OLD HORSE'S HOOF SHALL BE OUR WINEGLASS
WHICH DESERVES TO BE REWARDED WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD FOR YOUR WIFE MOST CERTAINLY I WOULD REPLIED THE PRINCE SO THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED
WOULD LIKE TO ENTER HER SERVICE THIS FLATTERING SPEECH PLEASED THE DRAGONS AND THE ELDEST OF THEM SAID WELL YOU MAY COME WITH ME AND I WILL TAKE YOU TO THE MOTHER DRAGON
AND AT LAST IN DESPAIR SAT DOWN ON A BIG STONE AND CONTEMPLATED HIS SAD FATE AS HE SAT THUS LOST IN THOUGHT HE NOTICED AN EAGLE FLYING OVER HIS HEAD THEN HE SUDDENLY BETHOUGHT HIM OF HIS LITTLE BELL
FOR FIRE WITH WHICH TO RELIGHT THE ONE SHE HAD ALLOWED TO GO OUT NOW THIS LOCRINOS WAS A CRUEL MONSTER WHO DEVOURED EVERYONE HE CAME ACROSS AND ESPECIALLY ENJOYED A CHANCE OF CATCHING
SHE ENTERED A MAGNIFICENT ROOM WHICH APPEARED TO OCCUPY THE ENTIRE CASTLE AND WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY GOLD AND JEWELLED STARS IN THE CEILING
THE PRINCE BEGGED FOR A FOAL OF THE MARE WHICH THE MOTHER DRAGON AT ONCE GAVE HIM AND OVER AND ABOVE A CLOAK MADE OF GOLD FOR SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM BECAUSE HE HAD PRAISED HER BEAUTY SO IN THE EVENING HE APPEARED AT THE BALL IN HIS GOLDEN CLOAK
I WILL TELL YOU THIS IN THE NORTH SEA LIES A DEAD SEA CAT THAT SHALL BE THEIR ROAST MEAT AND THE RIB OF A WHALE THAT SHALL BE THEIR SILVER SPOON AND THE HOLLOW FOOT OF A DEAD HORSE THAT SHALL BE THEIR WINEGLASS
FAIRER THAN A FAIRY EAGERLY RAN TO THE WINDOW BUT IN HER HASTE SHE UPSET THE BASIN AND SPILT ALL THE WATER WITH WHICH SHE HAD CAREFULLY FILLED IT OVERNIGHT NO OTHER WATER WAS AT HAND EXCEPT THAT IN THE TWO BOTTLES
MANY OF THE YOUNG BRAVES SOUGHT HER IN MARRIAGE BUT SHE WOULD LISTEN TO ONE ONLY A HANDSOME CHIEF WHO HAD TAKEN HER FANCY SOME YEARS BEFORE SO THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED AND GREAT REJOICINGS WERE MADE
INSTEAD OF HIDING AS HE APPROACHED AND BIRDS CIRCLED ROUND HIM
WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN HEARD THAT HER DAUGHTER WANTED TO MARRY THE PRINCE SHE SAID TO HIM I WILL GIVE MY CONSENT TO YOUR MARRIAGE GLADLY BUT MY DAUGHTER CAN ONLY STAY WITH YOU IN SUMMER IN WINTER WHEN EVERYTHING IS DEAD AND THE GROUND COVERED WITH SNOW
BUT FROM SUNRISE TO SUNSET HE SAT BY THE PLACE WHERE SHE WAS LAID THINKING OF HIS HAPPINESS THAT WAS BURIED THERE AT LAST AFTER MANY DAYS A LIGHT SEEMED TO COME TO HIM OUT OF THE DARKNESS
NO I DO NOT ANSWERED THE OLD MAN
THE KING OF THE EAGLES WILL APPEAR IF YOU RING IT TWICE THE KING OF THE FOXES WILL COME TO YOU AND IF YOU RING IT THREE TIMES YOU WILL SEE THE KING OF THE FISHES BY YOUR SIDE
WHO WAS FULL OF WONDER WHEN SHE SAW HIM AND SAID
ONCE THERE LIVED A KING WHO HAD NO CHILDREN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER HIS MARRIAGE AT LENGTH HEAVEN GRANTED HIM A DAUGHTER OF SUCH REMARKABLE BEAUTY THAT HE COULD THINK OF NO NAME SO APPROPRIATE FOR HER AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRY
HAD REVENGED HERSELF BY DEPRIVING HIM OF HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SOME YEARS THAT SHE HAD IMPRISONED HIM IN THE PALACE WHERE HE HAD FOUND HIS CONFINEMENT HARD TO BEAR FOR SOME TIME BUT NOW HE OWNED
BEGGED HER NOT TO LOSE HEART AND ASSURED HER THAT HER TROUBLES SHOULD BE REWARDED SHE ACCOMPANIED HER ADVICE BY THE GIFT OF A CRYSTAL SMELLING BOTTLE WITH STRICT ORDERS ONLY TO OPEN IT IN CASE OF URGENT NEED
I KNOW ENOUGH AND CAN HELP MYSELF SPLENDIDLY THEN HE WENT BY ANOTHER WAY THROUGH THE WINDOW SECRETLY AND IN ALL HASTE BACK TO HIS COMRADES HE TOLD THEM HOW THE DRAGON HAD BEEN OUTWITTED BY HIS GRANDMOTHER
WHICH STOOD AT NO GREAT DISTANCE HERE SHE WAS RECEIVED BY A BEAUTIFUL LADY DRESSED IN GREEN AND WHITE TO MATCH THE HOUSE WHICH APPARENTLY BELONGED TO HER AND OF WHICH SHE SEEMED THE ONLY INHABITANT
COULD NOT HELP FEELING PLEASED AND TOUCHED BY HIS ATTENTIONS THE PRINCE COULD ONLY APPEAR OR SPEAK UNDER THE FORM OF A RAINBOW AND IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT THE SUN SHOULD SHINE ON WATER SO AS TO ENABLE THE RAYS TO FORM THEMSELVES
THE DRAGON MADE A FACE AND GROWLED AGAIN THREE TIMES HUM
SAID THEY THEN THE DRAGON SEIZED THEM IN HIS CLAWS TOOK THEM THROUGH THE AIR OVER THE ARMY AND SET THEM DOWN ON THE EARTH A LONG WAY FROM IT HE GAVE THEM A LITTLE WHIP SAYING
WHO HAS BEEN CAPTURED BY A DRAGON IF YOU WISH TO MARRY HER YOU MUST FIRST SET HER FREE AND THIS I WILL HELP YOU TO DO I WILL GIVE YOU THIS LITTLE BELL IF YOU RING IT ONCE
AND ARRIVED JUST AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAD FALLEN FAST ASLEEP THIS TIME SHE MADE SURE OF CATCHING HER VICTIM BUT THE CAT SPIED HER OUT
SHE ASKED HIM HOW HE CAME AND WHAT WAS HIS BUSINESS THERE HE TOLD HER ALL THAT HAPPENED AND BECAUSE SHE WAS PLEASED WITH HIM SHE TOOK COMPASSION ON HIM
TOWARDS EVENING THE PRINCE HEARD A MIGHTY RUSHING SOUND IN THE AIR AND WHEN HE LOOKED UP HE SAW THOUSANDS OF EAGLES DRIVING THE MARE BEFORE THEM THEY SANK AT HIS FEET ON TO THE GROUND AND GAVE THE MARE OVER TO HIM THEN THE PRINCE RODE HOME TO THE OLD MOTHER DRAGON
THEY WENT INTO A FIELD SAT DOWN AND THE TWO PULLED LONG FACES AN OLD WOMAN PASSED BY AND ASKED THEM WHY THEY WERE SO SAD
AS SHE DID SO THE SPRIG OF MYRTLE SHE CARRIED TOUCHED THE GROUND AND IMMEDIATELY A GREEN AND SHADY BOWER SPRANG UP ROUND HER IN WHICH SHE HOPED TO SLEEP IN PEACE BUT LAGREE HAD NOT GIVEN UP HER PURSUIT
AND HOW HE HAD GIVEN THEM MONEY AS PLENTIFULLY AS BLACKBERRIES BUT AS THEY HAD SIGNED THEIR NAMES THEY WERE HIS UNLESS WHEN THE SEVEN YEARS HAD PASSED THEY COULD GUESS A RIDDLE THE OLD WOMAN SAID
AND AGAIN SHE LED HIM TO THE BALL ROOM THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM SAFE AND SOUND AND WHEN THEY WERE DANCING TOGETHER SHE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR IF YOU SUCCEED AGAIN TO MORROW WAIT FOR ME WITH THE FOAL IN THE MEADOW
THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME IN WHICH TO USE THE NUT WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HER SHE OPENED IT AND OUT CAME A DIMINUTIVE HALL PORTER
WHAT USE WAS IT OUR DESERTING WE MUST PERISH HERE MISERABLY WHILST THEY WERE SPEAKING A FIERY DRAGON CAME FLYING THROUGH THE AIR
FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FELT A STRONG DESIRE TO ENTER THIS CASTLE BUT BESIDES BEING HUNG A LITTLE ABOVE THE GROUND THERE SEEMED TO BE NEITHER DOORS NOR WINDOWS SHE HAD NO DOUBT THOUGH REALLY I CANNOT THINK WHY
HERE TOO WAS THE FLOWER QUEEN'S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER HER DRESS WAS WOVEN OUT OF THE MOST LOVELY FLOWERS IN THE WORLD AND HER COMPLEXION WAS LIKE LILIES AND ROSES AS THE PRINCE WAS DANCING WITH HER HE MANAGED TO WHISPER IN HER EAR
AT THE SAME MOMENT THE WALLS OF THE ROOM EXPANDED AND OPENED OUT REVEALING A GOLDEN THRONE COVERED WITH JEWELS
AND THAT HE MIGHT RETURN IN PEACE TO REIGN OVER HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE LONGING FOR HIS PRESENCE THE COURT RECEIVED THE NEW KING WITH JOYFUL ACCLAMATIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED HIM AT ANY OTHER TIME
AND TAKING IT OUT OF HIS POCKET HE RANG IT ONCE IN A MOMENT HE HEARD A RUSTLING SOUND IN THE AIR BESIDE HIM AND THE KING OF THE EAGLES SANK AT HIS FEET
ONLY CONFIDE YOUR TROUBLE IN ME
OVER THERE AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST IN THE LITTLE HUT YOU SEE IN THE DISTANCE REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN THE PRINCE LIFTED HER ON TO HIS HORSE AND SOON THEY REACHED THE HUT WHERE THE OLD WOMAN GOT DOWN AND TURNING TO THE PRINCE SAID
WHEN SEVEN DRAGONS RUSHED ON HIM AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED THE PRINCE REPLIED
IN THE FIRST AND MOST SPLENDID OF THESE CARRIAGES SAT PRINCE RAINBOW'S MOTHER SHE FONDLY EMBRACED HER SON AFTER WHICH SHE INFORMED HIM THAT HIS FATHER HAD BEEN DEAD FOR SOME YEARS THAT THE ANGER OF THE FAIRIES WAS AT LENGTH APPEASED
THAT WON'T SAVE US AND THEY REMAINED WHERE THEY WERE BUT THE THIRD AND MERRY ONE JUMPED UP AND WENT INTO THE WOOD TILL HE FOUND THE ROCK HUT IN THE HUT SAT A VERY OLD WOMAN WHO WAS THE DRAGON'S GRANDMOTHER
A COUPLE OF JACK RABBITS RUN IN OFF THE PRAIRIE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE INNOCENT OF WHAT AWAITED THEM THAN WERE LENA AND I OUR EXCITEMENT BEGAN WITH THE RISE OF THE CURTAIN WHEN THE MOODY VARVILLE SEATED BEFORE THE FIRE INTERROGATED NANINE
THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO WHICH I HAD SEEN JAMES O'NEILL PLAY THAT WINTER WAS BY THE ONLY ALEXANDRE DUMAS I KNEW THIS PLAY I SAW WAS BY HIS SON AND I EXPECTED A FAMILY RESEMBLANCE
AT FIRST I WAS INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THIS HISTORY OF A WOMAN ON WHOM CLOTHED IN THE MAJESTY OF HER ALMOST ENDLESS YEARS THE SHADOW OF ETERNITY ITSELF LAY LIKE THE DARK WING OF NIGHT WAS SOME GIGANTIC ALLEGORY OF WHICH I COULD NOT CATCH THE MEANING
GAMING TABLES WHERE THE MEN PLAYED WITH PILES OF GOLD AND A STAIRCASE DOWN WHICH THE GUESTS MADE THEIR ENTRANCE AFTER ALL THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED ROUND THE CARD TABLES AND YOUNG DUVAL HAD BEEN WARNED BY PRUDENCE MARGUERITE DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE WITH VARVILLE SUCH A CLOAK
DECIDEDLY THERE WAS A NEW TANG ABOUT THIS DIALOGUE I HAD NEVER HEARD IN THE THEATER LINES THAT WERE ALIVE THAT PRESUPPOSED AND TOOK FOR GRANTED LIKE THOSE WHICH PASSED BETWEEN VARVILLE AND MARGUERITE IN THE BRIEF ENCOUNTER BEFORE HER FRIENDS ENTERED
WE NEVER ASCERTAINED AND NOW ALAS WE NEVER SHALL AT LEAST NOT YET THESE AND MANY OTHER QUESTIONS ARISE IN MY MIND BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD OF ASKING THEM NOW WILL YOU UNDERTAKE THE TASK
I HEARD AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS POPULARLY SUPPOSED TO BE AS MUCH AFRAID OF A WOMAN AS MOST PEOPLE ARE OF A MAD DOG WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR HIS PRECIPITATE RETREAT I CANNOT SAY HOWEVER THAT YOUNG VINCEY SHOWED MUCH AVERSION TO FEMININE SOCIETY ON THIS OCCASION
OR BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID OF RIDICULE AND DOUBT BEING CAST UPON OUR STATEMENTS I HOLD ONE VIEW ABOUT THIS MATTER AND LEO HOLDS ANOTHER AND FINALLY AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION WE HAVE COME TO A COMPROMISE NAMELY TO SEND THE HISTORY TO YOU
AND MAKES THEM DESERVEDLY DISLIKED BY THEIR FELLOWS THAT SAME EVENING
YOU ARE QUITE COMFORTABLE HERE ARE N'T YOU I LIVE IN LINCOLN NOW TOO JIM I'M IN BUSINESS FOR MYSELF I HAVE A DRESSMAKING SHOP IN THE RALEIGH BLOCK OUT ON O STREET I'VE MADE A REAL GOOD START BUT LENA WHEN DID YOU COME OH I'VE BEEN HERE ALL WINTER
SHE WAS ALREADY OLD WITH A RAVAGED COUNTENANCE AND A PHYSIQUE CURIOUSLY HARD AND STIFF SHE MOVED WITH DIFFICULTY I THINK SHE WAS LAME I SEEM TO REMEMBER SOME STORY ABOUT A MALADY OF THE SPINE
BY HORACE HOLLY A NAME THAT AT THE MOMENT WAS NOT FAMILIAR TO ME IT RAN AS FOLLOWS
SINCE IT WAS EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE THAT THE ACQUAINTANCE WOULD END IN A TRANSFER OF HER AFFECTIONS HE WAS ALTOGETHER TOO GOOD LOOKING AND WHAT IS MORE HE HAD NONE OF THAT CONSCIOUSNESS AND CONCEIT ABOUT HIM WHICH USUALLY AFFLICTS HANDSOME MEN
IN ADDITION HIS FACE WAS ALMOST WITHOUT FLAW A GOOD FACE AS WELL AS A BEAUTIFUL ONE AND WHEN HE LIFTED HIS HAT WHICH HE DID JUST THEN TO A PASSING LADY I SAW THAT HIS HEAD WAS COVERED WITH LITTLE GOLDEN CURLS GROWING CLOSE TO THE SCALP
BUT TO HIS OWN LITTLE COUNTRY TO HIS FATHER'S FIELDS SLOPING DOWN TO THE RIVER AND TO THE OLD BEECH TREES WITH BROKEN TOPS CLERIC SAID HE THOUGHT VIRGIL WHEN HE WAS DYING AT BRINDISI MUST HAVE REMEMBERED THAT PASSAGE
AFTER THE SECOND ACT I LEFT LENA IN TEARFUL CONTEMPLATION OF THE CEILING AND WENT OUT INTO THE LOBBY TO SMOKE AS I WALKED ABOUT THERE I CONGRATULATED MYSELF THAT I HAD NOT BROUGHT SOME LINCOLN GIRL WHO WOULD TALK DURING THE WAITS ABOUT THE JUNIOR DANCES
TO BE BRIEF AND COME TO MY BUSINESS I HAVE RECENTLY READ WITH MUCH INTEREST A BOOK OF YOURS DESCRIBING A CENTRAL AFRICAN ADVENTURE
AND I BEHELD LENA LINGARD SHE WAS SO QUIETLY CONVENTIONALIZED BY CITY CLOTHES THAT I MIGHT HAVE PASSED HER ON THE STREET WITHOUT SEEING HER HER BLACK SUIT FITTED HER FIGURE SMOOTHLY AND A BLACK LACE HAT WITH PALE BLUE FORGET ME NOTS
HER ARMAND WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY YOUNG AND SLIGHT A HANDSOME YOUTH PERPLEXED IN THE EXTREME BUT WHAT DID IT MATTER I BELIEVED DEVOUTLY IN HER POWER TO FASCINATE HIM IN HER DAZZLING LOVELINESS I BELIEVED HER YOUNG
HAD NEVER BEEN SO GLITTERING AND RECKLESS AS ON THE NIGHT WHEN IT GATHERED IN OLYMPE'S SALON FOR THE FOURTH ACT THERE WERE CHANDELIERS HUNG FROM THE CEILING I REMEMBER MANY SERVANTS IN LIVERY
SUCH A FAN SUCH JEWELS AND HER FACE ONE KNEW AT A GLANCE HOW IT WAS WITH HER WHEN ARMAND WITH THE TERRIBLE WORDS LOOK ALL OF YOU I OWE THIS WOMAN NOTHING
WAS DELICATE TORMENT I SEEM TO REMEMBER GILDED CHAIRS AND TABLES ARRANGED HURRIEDLY BY FOOTMEN IN WHITE GLOVES AND STOCKINGS LINEN OF DAZZLING WHITENESS GLITTERING GLASS SILVER DISHES A GREAT BOWL OF FRUIT AND THE REDDEST OF ROSES
GOOD GRACIOUS I SAID TO MY FRIEND WITH WHOM I WAS WALKING
EXACTLY AS IT HAPPENED AS REGARDS SHE HERSELF I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD DAY BY DAY WE GAVE GREATER OCCASION TO REGRET THAT WE DID NOT BETTER AVAIL OURSELVES OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION
ONE COULD EXPERIENCE EXCESS AND SATIETY WITHOUT THE INCONVENIENCE OF LEARNING WHAT TO DO WITH ONE'S HANDS IN A DRAWING ROOM WHEN THE CHARACTERS ALL SPOKE AT ONCE AND I MISSED SOME OF THE PHRASES THEY FLASHED AT EACH OTHER I WAS IN MISERY
THIS SUMMER I'M GOING TO BUILD THE HOUSE FOR MOTHER I'VE TALKED ABOUT SO LONG I WON'T BE ABLE TO PAY UP ON IT AT FIRST BUT
ILLNESS WHEN THE GAYETY WAS AT ITS HEIGHT HER PALLOR THE HANDKERCHIEF SHE CRUSHED AGAINST HER LIPS THE COUGH SHE SMOTHERED UNDER THE LAUGHTER WHILE GASTON KEPT PLAYING THE PIANO LIGHTLY IT ALL WRUNG MY HEART
THE DANISH LAUNDRY GIRLS AND THE THREE BOHEMIAN MARYS LENA HAD BROUGHT THEM ALL BACK TO ME IT CAME OVER ME AS IT HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE THE RELATION BETWEEN GIRLS LIKE THOSE AND THE POETRY OF VIRGIL
FILLING THE WORLD WITH LIGHT AND FRAGRANCE HERE ALSO I AM NOT ABLE TO ANSWER BUT MUST LEAVE THE READER TO FORM HIS OWN JUDGMENT ON THE FACTS BEFORE HIM
ARDENT RECKLESS DISILLUSIONED UNDER SENTENCE FEVERISH AVID OF PLEASURE I WANTED TO CROSS THE FOOTLIGHTS AND HELP THE SLIM WAISTED ARMAND IN THE FRILLED SHIRT TO CONVINCE HER THAT THERE WAS STILL LOYALTY AND DEVOTION IN THE WORLD HER SUDDEN
OR IS THE TRUE EXPLANATION WHAT I BELIEVE IT TO BE NAMELY THAT AYESHA SEEING FURTHER THAN WE CAN SEE PERCEIVED THE GERM AND SMOULDERING SPARK OF GREATNESS WHICH LAY HID WITHIN HER LOVER'S SOUL
I CAUGHT A FAINT ODOR OF VIOLET SACHET SO THAT'S LATIN IS IT IT LOOKS HARD
I THINK I'D BETTER GO HOME AND LOOK AFTER ANTONIA I SAID I THINK YOU HAD
IN A MOMENT I WATCHED HER FADE DOWN THE DUSKY STAIRWAY WHEN I TURNED BACK TO MY ROOM THE PLACE SEEMED MUCH PLEASANTER THAN BEFORE LENA HAD LEFT SOMETHING WARM AND FRIENDLY IN THE LAMPLIGHT
AND HIS WHISKERS GREW RIGHT UP TO HIS HAIR SO THAT THERE WAS UNCOMMONLY LITTLE OF HIS COUNTENANCE TO BE SEEN ALTOGETHER HE REMINDED ME FORCIBLY OF A GORILLA AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY PLEASING AND GENIAL ABOUT THE MAN'S EYE I REMEMBER SAYING THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HIM
UNDER THESE ALTERED CONDITIONS IT HAS BECOME A QUESTION WHETHER WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN WITHHOLDING FROM THE WORLD AN ACCOUNT OF A PHENOMENON WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE OF UNPARALLELED INTEREST MERELY BECAUSE OUR PRIVATE LIFE IS INVOLVED
HOWEVER THIS MAY BE IT HAS GIVEN ME AN IDEA
BUT NOT SO MUCH AS HER CYNICISM IN THE LONG DIALOGUE WITH HER LOVER WHICH FOLLOWED
EVERY SENTENCE MADE ONE OLDER AND WISER
FLUNG THE GOLD AND BANK NOTES AT THE HALF SWOONING MARGUERITE LENA COWERED BESIDE ME AND COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS THE CURTAIN ROSE ON THE BEDROOM SCENE
SHE HANDED HER FEELINGS OVER TO THE ACTORS WITH A KIND OF FATALISTIC RESIGNATION ACCESSORIES OF COSTUME AND SCENE MEANT MUCH MORE TO HER THAN TO ME SHE SAT ENTRANCED THROUGH ROBIN HOOD AND HUNG UPON THE LIPS OF THE CONTRALTO WHO SANG
WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE NECESSARY I INTRODUCE THE WORLD TO AYESHA AND THE CAVES OF KOR THE EDITOR P S THERE IS ON CONSIDERATION
AS I THINK THE READER WILL BE ALSO AND AT ONCE MADE UP MY MIND TO PRESS ON WITH THE MATTER I WROTE TO THIS EFFECT TO MISTER HOLLY BUT A WEEK AFTERWARDS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THAT GENTLEMAN'S LAWYERS RETURNING MY OWN
WE ARRIVED EARLY BECAUSE LENA LIKED TO WATCH THE PEOPLE COME IN THERE WAS A NOTE ON THE PROGRAMME SAYING THAT THE INCIDENTAL MUSIC WOULD BE FROM THE OPERA TRAVIATA WHICH WAS MADE FROM THE SAME STORY AS THE PLAY WE HAD NEITHER OF US READ THE PLAY AND WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
IN LINCOLN THE BEST PART OF THE THEATRICAL SEASON CAME LATE WHEN THE GOOD COMPANIES STOPPED OFF THERE FOR ONE NIGHT STANDS AFTER THEIR LONG RUNS IN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO THAT SPRING LENA WENT WITH ME TO SEE JOSEPH JEFFERSON IN RIP VAN WINKLE
THE NAME OF AN ACTRESS OF WHOM I HAD OFTEN HEARD AND THE NAME CAMILLE I CALLED AT THE RALEIGH BLOCK FOR LENA ON SATURDAY EVENING AND WE WALKED DOWN TO THE THEATER THE WEATHER WAS WARM AND SULTRY AND PUT US BOTH IN A HOLIDAY HUMOR
AS I SAT DOWN TO MY BOOK AT LAST MY OLD DREAM ABOUT LENA COMING ACROSS THE HARVEST FIELD IN HER SHORT SKIRT SEEMED TO ME LIKE THE MEMORY OF AN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE IT FLOATED BEFORE ME ON THE PAGE LIKE A PICTURE AND UNDERNEATH IT STOOD THE MOURNFUL LINE
BUT AS I WENT ON I ABANDONED THAT IDEA ALSO TO ME THE STORY SEEMS TO BEAR THE STAMP OF TRUTH UPON ITS FACE ITS EXPLANATION I MUST LEAVE TO OTHERS AND WITH THIS SLIGHT PREFACE
TO BEGIN WITH HE WAS SHORTISH RATHER BOW LEGGED VERY DEEP CHESTED AND WITH UNUSUALLY LONG ARMS HE HAD DARK HAIR AND SMALL EYES AND THE HAIR GREW RIGHT DOWN ON HIS FOREHEAD
YOU WILL SEE IT STATED IN THIS MANUSCRIPT THAT I OR RATHER WE HAD MADE UP OUR MINDS NOT TO MAKE THIS HISTORY PUBLIC DURING OUR JOINT LIVES NOR SHOULD WE ALTER OUR DETERMINATION WERE IT NOT FOR A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAS RECENTLY ARISEN
AND WELL KNEW THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER GIFT OF LIFE WATERED BY HER WISDOM AND SHONE UPON WITH THE SUNSHINE OF HER PRESENCE IT WOULD BLOOM LIKE A FLOWER AND FLASH OUT LIKE A STAR
OH PROMISE ME TOWARD THE END OF APRIL THE BILLBOARDS WHICH I WATCHED ANXIOUSLY IN THOSE DAYS BLOOMED OUT ONE MORNING WITH GLEAMING WHITE POSTERS ON WHICH TWO NAMES WERE IMPRESSIVELY PRINTED IN BLUE GOTHIC LETTERS
THOUGH PERHAPS I ALONE KNEW CLERIC INTIMATELY ENOUGH TO GUESS WHAT THAT FEELING WAS IN THE EVENING AS I SAT STARING AT MY BOOK THE FERVOR OF HIS VOICE STIRRED THROUGH THE QUANTITIES ON THE PAGE BEFORE ME
SOME YEARS AGO I THE EDITOR WAS STOPPING WITH A FRIEND VIR DOCTISSIMUS ET AMICUS NEUS AT A CERTAIN UNIVERSITY WHICH FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS HISTORY WE WILL CALL CAMBRIDGE
WHICH TOGETHER WITH THE SCARAB THE ROYAL SON OF THE SUN
ALL RIGHT ANSWERED MY FRIEND NOTHING EASIER I KNOW VINCEY I'LL INTRODUCE YOU AND HE DID AND FOR SOME MINUTES WE STOOD CHATTING ABOUT THE ZULU PEOPLE I THINK FOR I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM THE CAPE AT THE TIME PRESENTLY HOWEVER
NEXT SUMMER I'LL TAKE HER DOWN NEW FURNITURE AND CARPETS SO SHE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO ALL WINTER I WATCHED LENA SITTING THERE SO SMOOTH AND SUNNY AND WELL CARED FOR AND THOUGHT OF HOW SHE USED TO RUN BAREFOOT OVER THE PRAIRIE UNTIL AFTER THE SNOW BEGAN TO FLY
SHE BORE HARD ON THE IDEA AND ON THE CONSONANTS AT ALL TIMES SHE WAS HIGHLY TRAGIC DEVOURED BY REMORSE LIGHTNESS OF STRESS OR BEHAVIOR WAS FAR FROM HER HER VOICE WAS HEAVY AND DEEP
LENA'S FACE DIMPLED SOME OF US COULD TELL HER THINGS BUT IT WOULD N'T DO ANY GOOD SHE'D ALWAYS BELIEVE HIM THAT'S ANTONIA'S FAILING YOU KNOW IF SHE ONCE LIKES PEOPLE SHE WON'T HEAR ANYTHING AGAINST THEM
WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THEIR CLIENT AND MISTER LEO VINCEY HAD ALREADY LEFT THIS COUNTRY FOR THIBET AND THEY DID NOT AT PRESENT KNOW THEIR ADDRESS WELL THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY OF THE HISTORY ITSELF THE READER MUST JUDGE I GIVE IT HIM
I FEEL IT INCUMBENT ON ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT MY EXACT CONNECTION WITH IT IS AND SO I MAY AS WELL SAY AT ONCE THAT I AM NOT THE NARRATOR BUT ONLY THE EDITOR OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY HISTORY AND THEN GO ON TO TELL HOW IT FOUND ITS WAY INTO MY HANDS
AS IF SHE WERE SUMMONING HIM TO THE BAR OF JUDGMENT BUT THE LINES WERE ENOUGH SHE HAD ONLY TO UTTER THEM THEY CREATED THE CHARACTER IN SPITE OF HER THE HEARTLESS WORLD WHICH MARGUERITE RE ENTERED WITH VARVILLE
LOOK AT ME I'VE NEVER EARNED A DOLLAR AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO TONY SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO BE RICHER THAN MISTER HARLING SOME DAY SHE'S ALWAYS BRAGGING ABOUT YOU YOU KNOW TELL ME HOW IS TONY SHE'S FINE
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT LOOKING YOU UP LOTS OF TIMES
THAT MY WARD
I TRAMPED THROUGH THE PUDDLES AND UNDER THE SHOWERY TREES MOURNING FOR MARGUERITE GAUTHIER AS IF SHE HAD DIED ONLY YESTERDAY SIGHING WITH THE SPIRIT OF EIGHTEEN FORTY WHICH HAD SIGHED SO MUCH
WE CAN TALK WHEN YOU COME TO SEE ME I EXPECT YOU DON'T OFTEN HAVE LADY VISITORS
ONE MARCH EVENING IN MY SOPHOMORE YEAR I WAS SITTING ALONE IN MY ROOM AFTER SUPPER
P S OF COURSE IF ANY PROFIT RESULTS FROM THE SALE OF THE WRITING SHOULD YOU CARE TO UNDERTAKE ITS PUBLICATION YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH IT BUT IF THERE IS A LOSS I WILL LEAVE INSTRUCTIONS WITH MY LAWYERS MESSRS GEOFFREY AND JORDAN TO MEET IT
IF THERE WERE NO GIRLS LIKE THEM IN THE WORLD THERE WOULD BE NO POETRY I UNDERSTOOD THAT CLEARLY FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS REVELATION SEEMED TO ME INESTIMABLY PRECIOUS I CLUNG TO IT AS IF IT MIGHT SUDDENLY VANISH
A STOUTISH LADY WHOSE NAME I DO NOT REMEMBER CAME ALONG THE PAVEMENT ACCOMPANIED BY A PRETTY FAIR HAIRED GIRL AND THESE TWO MISTER VINCEY WHO CLEARLY KNEW THEM WELL AT ONCE JOINED WALKING OFF IN THEIR COMPANY
INFORMING THE SUBSTANCE OF A MORTAL WHO YET DREW HER STRENGTH FROM EARTH AND IN WHOSE HUMAN BOSOM PASSIONS YET ROSE AND FELL AND BEAT AS IN THE UNDYING WORLD AROUND HER THE WINDS AND THE TIDES RISE AND FALL AND BEAT UNCEASINGLY
SAT DEMURELY ON HER YELLOW HAIR I LED HER TOWARD CLERIC'S CHAIR THE ONLY COMFORTABLE ONE I HAD QUESTIONING HER CONFUSEDLY SHE WAS NOT DISCONCERTED BY MY EMBARRASSMENT SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER WITH THE NAIVE CURIOSITY I REMEMBERED SO WELL
IT'S A GOOD THING THE HARLINGS ARE FRIENDLY WITH HER AGAIN LARRY'S AFRAID OF THEM THEY SHIP SO MUCH GRAIN THEY HAVE INFLUENCE WITH THE RAILROAD PEOPLE WHAT ARE YOU STUDYING SHE LEANED HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND DREW MY BOOK TOWARD HER
THEY CALL HIM THE GREEK GOD BUT LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE HE'S VINCEY'S THAT'S THE GOD'S NAME GUARDIAN AND SUPPOSED TO BE FULL OF EVERY KIND OF INFORMATION
NANINE ALONE COULD HAVE MADE ME CRY I LOVED NANINE TENDERLY AND GASTON HOW ONE CLUNG TO THAT GOOD FELLOW THE NEW YEAR'S PRESENTS WERE NOT TOO MUCH NOTHING COULD BE TOO MUCH NOW I WEPT UNRESTRAINEDLY
AT ANY RATE TO MY VIEW PARTICULARLY INTERESTING INDEED ONE MIGHT IMAGINE THAT MISTER HOLLY WOULD UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE EASILY OUTSTRIPPED HIM IN THE FAVOUR OF SHE CAN IT BE THAT EXTREMES MEET
THE ROOM WAS INVADED BY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN AND DASHING YOUNG MEN LAUGHING AND TALKING TOGETHER THE MEN WERE DRESSED MORE OR LESS AFTER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE PLAY WAS WRITTEN THE WOMEN WERE NOT I SAW NO INCONSISTENCY
I SUPPOSE NO WOMAN COULD HAVE BEEN FURTHER IN PERSON VOICE AND TEMPERAMENT FROM DUMAS APPEALING HEROINE THAN THE VETERAN ACTRESS WHO FIRST ACQUAINTED ME WITH HER HER CONCEPTION OF THE CHARACTER WAS AS HEAVY AND UNCOMPROMISING AS HER DICTION
TO BRING THE MUSE INTO MY COUNTRY CLERIC HAD EXPLAINED TO US THAT PATRIA HERE MEANT NOT A NATION OR EVEN A PROVINCE
AND HOW CRAZY MARY CHASED HER ROUND AND ROUND THE CORNFIELDS IT SEEMED TO ME WONDERFUL THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE GOT ON SO WELL IN THE WORLD CERTAINLY SHE HAD NO ONE BUT HERSELF TO THANK FOR IT
ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN WAS I THINK WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE HANDSOMEST YOUNG FELLOW I HAVE EVER SEEN HE WAS VERY TALL VERY BROAD AND HAD A LOOK OF POWER AND A GRACE OF BEARING THAT SEEMED AS NATIVE TO HIM AS IT IS TO A WILD STAG
GOING AWAY AGAIN THIS TIME TO CENTRAL ASIA WHERE IF ANYWHERE UPON THIS EARTH WISDOM IS TO BE FOUND AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR SOJOURN THERE WILL BE A LONG ONE POSSIBLY WE SHALL NOT RETURN
AND NOW WHAT AM I TO SAY FURTHER I REALLY DO NOT KNOW
HE WILL OBSERVE THAT SO FAR AS WE ARE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM THERE APPEARS TO BE NOTHING IN THE CHARACTER OF LEO VINCEY WHICH IN THE OPINION OF MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO ATTRACT AN INTELLECT SO POWERFUL AS THAT OF AYESHA HE IS NOT EVEN
SHE WORKS FOR MISSUS GARDENER AT THE HOTEL NOW SHE'S HOUSEKEEPER MISSUS GARDENER'S HEALTH IS N'T WHAT IT WAS AND SHE CAN'T SEE AFTER EVERYTHING LIKE SHE USED TO
OVERLOOKED THINGS IS SHE STILL GOING WITH LARRY DONOVAN OH THAT'S ON WORSE THAN EVER I GUESS THEY'RE ENGAGED TONY TALKS ABOUT HIM LIKE HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE RAILROAD EVERYBODY LAUGHS ABOUT IT BECAUSE SHE WAS NEVER A GIRL TO BE SOFT
LENA WEPT UNCEASINGLY AND I SAT HELPLESS TO PREVENT THE CLOSING OF THAT CHAPTER OF IDYLLIC LOVE DREADING THE RETURN OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE INEFFABLE HAPPINESS WAS ONLY TO BE THE MEASURE OF HIS FALL
WHILE THE CHARMINGLY SINCERE YOUNG MAN PLEADED WITH HER ACCOMPANIED BY THE ORCHESTRA IN THE OLD TRAVIATA DUET MISTERIOSO MISTERIOSO SHE MAINTAINED HER BITTER SKEPTICISM AND THE CURTAIN FELL ON HER DANCING RECKLESSLY WITH THE OTHERS
I WAS WONDERING WHETHER THAT PARTICULAR ROCKY STRIP OF NEW ENGLAND COAST ABOUT WHICH HE HAD SO OFTEN TOLD ME WAS CLERIC'S PATRIA BEFORE I HAD GOT FAR WITH MY READING I WAS DISTURBED BY A KNOCK I HURRIED TO THE DOOR AND WHEN I OPENED IT
I LOOKED AND FOUND THE OLDER MAN QUITE AS INTERESTING IN HIS WAY AS THE GLORIFIED SPECIMEN OF HUMANITY AT HIS SIDE HE APPEARED TO BE ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE AND WAS I THINK AS UGLY AS HIS COMPANION WAS HANDSOME
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE A GOOD PLAY JIM I CAN'T STAY AT HOME IN THE EVENING IF THERE'S ONE IN TOWN I'D BE WILLING TO WORK LIKE A SLAVE IT SEEMS TO ME TO LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE THEATERS LET'S GO TO A SHOW TOGETHER SOMETIME
THIS WAS THE LAST I SAW OR HEARD OF CHARON AND THE GREEK GOD FOR MANY A LONG DAY
AND WHICH HAD REACHED ME ONLY THAT NIGHT ACROSS LONG YEARS AND SEVERAL LANGUAGES THROUGH THE PERSON OF AN INFIRM OLD ACTRESS THE IDEA IS ONE THAT NO CIRCUMSTANCES CAN FRUSTRATE WHEREVER AND WHENEVER THAT PIECE IS PUT ON
CROWDED WITH FIGURES OF GODS AND MEN SHOULD BE BURNED RATHER THAN SURVIVE HIM UNPERFECTED THEN HIS MIND MUST HAVE GONE BACK TO THE PERFECT UTTERANCE OF THE GEORGICS WHERE THE PEN WAS FITTED TO THE MATTER AS THE PLOUGH IS TO THE FURROW
SHE LAUGHED HER MELLOW EASY LAUGH THAT WAS EITHER VERY ARTLESS OR VERY COMPREHENDING ONE NEVER QUITE KNEW WHICH YOU SEEM THE SAME THOUGH EXCEPT YOU'RE A YOUNG MAN NOW OF COURSE DO YOU THINK I'VE CHANGED
I WALKED WITH HER TO THE DOOR COME AND SEE ME SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE LONESOME BUT MAYBE YOU HAVE ALL THE FRIENDS YOU WANT HAVE YOU SHE TURNED HER SOFT CHEEK TO ME HAVE YOU SHE WHISPERED TEASINGLY IN MY EAR
AND THAT THE VERY EXCESS AND SPLENDOUR OF HER MIND LED HER BY MEANS OF SOME STRANGE PHYSICAL REACTION TO WORSHIP AT THE SHRINE OF MATTER
WOULD YOU LIKE TO I'D BE EVER SO PLEASED I'M NEVER BUSY AFTER SIX O'CLOCK AND I LET MY SEWING GIRLS GO AT HALF PAST FIVE I BOARD TO SAVE TIME BUT SOMETIMES I COOK A CHOP FOR MYSELF AND I'D BE GLAD TO COOK ONE FOR YOU WELL
HOW SURPRISED MISSUS BURDEN WOULD BE LENA LAUGHED SOFTLY AS SHE ROSE
OR WHETHER THE CADETS WOULD CAMP AT PLATTSMOUTH LENA WAS AT LEAST A WOMAN AND I WAS A MAN
MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN MY DEAR SIR YOU WILL BE SURPRISED CONSIDERING THE VERY SLIGHT NATURE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE TO GET A LETTER FROM ME
UTTER CLARITY OF THE WESTERN SLOPE THE EVENING STAR HUNG LIKE A LAMP SUSPENDED BY SILVER CHAINS LIKE THE LAMP ENGRAVED UPON THE TITLE PAGE OF OLD LATIN TEXTS WHICH IS ALWAYS APPEARING IN NEW HEAVENS AND WAKING NEW DESIRES IN MEN
BETWEEN THE ACTS WE HAD NO TIME TO FORGET THE ORCHESTRA KEPT SAWING AWAY AT THE TRAVIATA MUSIC SO JOYOUS AND SAD SO THIN AND FAR AWAY SO CLAP TRAP AND YET SO HEART BREAKING
WHOSE NAME I DISCOVERED WAS HOLLY WHEN HE SAW THE LADIES ADVANCING HE SUDDENLY STOPPED SHORT IN HIS TALK CAST A REPROACHFUL LOOK AT HIS COMPANION AND WITH AN ABRUPT NOD TO MYSELF TURNED AND MARCHED OFF ALONE ACROSS THE STREET
FROM THAT MARVELLOUS WOMAN WHO WAS SHE HOW DID SHE FIRST COME TO THE CAVES OF KOR
LEO VINCEY AND MYSELF HAVE RECENTLY PASSED THROUGH A REAL AFRICAN ADVENTURE OF A NATURE SO MUCH MORE MARVELLOUS THAN THE ONE WHICH YOU DESCRIBE THAT TO TELL THE TRUTH I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO SUBMIT IT TO YOU LEST YOU SHOULD DISBELIEVE MY TALE
BUT A MONTH AGO I RECEIVED A LETTER AND TWO PACKETS ONE OF MANUSCRIPT
NO I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO WITH ME I'M TO MEET SOME SWEDES AT THE DRUG STORE YOU WOULD N'T CARE FOR THEM I WANTED TO SEE YOUR ROOM SO I COULD WRITE TONY ALL ABOUT IT BUT I MUST TELL HER HOW I LEFT YOU RIGHT HERE WITH YOUR BOOKS SHE'S ALWAYS SO AFRAID SOME ONE WILL RUN OFF WITH YOU
GIVING YOU FULL LEAVE TO PUBLISH IT IF YOU THINK FIT THE ONLY STIPULATION BEING THAT YOU SHALL DISGUISE OUR REAL NAMES
IT REMINDED ME AT ANY RATE TO SHUT MY WINDOW AND LIGHT MY WICK IN ANSWER I DID SO REGRETFULLY AND THE DIM OBJECTS IN THE ROOM EMERGED FROM THE SHADOWS AND TOOK THEIR PLACE ABOUT ME WITH THE HELPFULNESS WHICH CUSTOM BREEDS
SHE BEGAN TO PUT ON HER WHITE GLOVES IT'S BEEN AWFUL GOOD TO SEE YOU JIM
MY WINDOW WAS OPEN AND THE EARTHY WIND BLOWING THROUGH MADE ME INDOLENT ON THE EDGE OF THE PRAIRIE WHERE THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN THE SKY WAS TURQUOISE BLUE LIKE A LAKE WITH GOLD LIGHT THROBBING IN IT HIGHER UP IN THE
WE GIVE YOU COMPLETE FREEDOM AND AS A REWARD YOU WILL WE BELIEVE HAVE THE CREDIT OF PRESENTING TO THE WORLD THE MOST WONDERFUL HISTORY AS DISTINGUISHED FROM ROMANCE THAT ITS RECORDS CAN SHOW READ THE MANUSCRIPT WHICH I HAVE COPIED OUT FAIRLY FOR YOUR BENEFIT
THIS WAS NOT A BOAST BUT A HOPE AT ONCE BOLD AND DEVOUTLY HUMBLE THAT HE MIGHT BRING THE MUSE BUT LATELY COME TO ITALY FROM HER CLOUDY GRECIAN MOUNTAINS NOT TO THE CAPITAL THE PALATIA ROMANA
AND HE MUST HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH THE THANKFULNESS OF A GOOD MAN I WAS THE FIRST TO BRING THE MUSE INTO MY COUNTRY WE LEFT THE CLASSROOM QUIETLY
SHE TOOK OFF HER JACKET AND SAT MORE AT EASE IN HER BLOUSE OF SOME SOFT FLIMSY SILK SHE WAS ALREADY AT HOME IN MY PLACE HAD SLIPPED QUIETLY INTO IT AS SHE DID INTO EVERYTHING
HOW I LOVED TO HEAR HER LAUGH AGAIN IT WAS SO SOFT AND UNEXCITED AND APPRECIATIVE GAVE A FAVORABLE INTERPRETATION TO EVERYTHING WHEN I CLOSED MY EYES I COULD HEAR THEM ALL LAUGHING
WAS WET THROUGH BY THE TIME THAT MORIBUND WOMAN SANK FOR THE LAST TIME INTO THE ARMS OF HER LOVER WHEN WE REACHED THE DOOR OF THE THEATER THE STREETS WERE SHINING WITH RAIN I HAD PRUDENTLY BROUGHT ALONG MISSUS HARLING'S USEFUL COMMENCEMENT PRESENT
BIG TRUNKS AND CASES WERE BEING BUMPED DOWN AND DRAGGED ABOUT SAILORS WERE UNCOILING ROPES AND HURRYING TO AND FRO OFFICERS WERE GIVING ORDERS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND CHILDREN AND NURSES WERE COMING ON BOARD
AND BIDDING THE OTHERS KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT MYLES SHINNED UP THIS TREE AND CHOOSING ONE OF THE THICKER LIMBS CLIMBED OUT UPON IT FOR SOME LITTLE DISTANCE THEN LOWERING HIS BODY HE HUNG AT ARM'S LENGTH THE BRANCH BENDING WITH HIS WEIGHT AND SLOWLY LET HIMSELF DOWN
MISTER HOBBS COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE OF HIS SENSES WHEN HE LOOKED ACROSS THE COUNTER AND SAW DICK RUSH IN WITH THE PAPER IN HIS HAND THE BOY WAS OUT OF BREATH WITH RUNNING SO MUCH OUT OF BREATH IN FACT THAT HE COULD SCARCELY SPEAK
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS AGREED THAT THE EARL OF DORINCOURT WAS HER DEADLY ENEMY AND WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HER SON AS HIS HEIR IF HE COULD HELP IT AND AS THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME SLIGHT FLAW IN THE PAPERS SHE HAD PRODUCED
THAT'S SO HE REPLIED THIS HERE CALLS FOR LAWYERS AND LEAVING THE STORE IN THE CARE OF A SUBSTITUTE HE STRUGGLED INTO HIS COAT AND MARCHED DOWN TOWN WITH DICK AND THE TWO PRESENTED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR ROMANTIC STORY IN MISTER HARRISON'S OFFICE
GLOOM HAD SETTLED UPON MISTER HOBBS HE WAS MUCH DEPRESSED IN SPIRITS WHEN HIS YOUNG FRIEND BROUGHT TO HIM IN TRIUMPH THE PARTING GIFT OF A GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN MISTER HOBBS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT PROPERLY
AND WHEN IT FELL IT WAS TO DROP WITHIN THE PRIVY GARDEN THE SHOUTS OF THE YOUNG PLAYERS WERE INSTANTLY STILLED AND GASCOYNE WHO STOOD NEAREST MYLES THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS BELT GIVING A LONG SHRILL WHISTLE
THE TOP OF THE WALL WAS POINTED LIKE A HOUSE ROOF AND IMMEDIATELY BELOW HIM WAS COVERED BY A THICK GROWTH OF GREEN MOSS AND IT FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND AS HE HUNG THERE THAT MAYBE IT WOULD OFFER A VERY SLIPPERY FOOTHOLD FOR ONE DROPPING UPON THE STEEP SLOPES OF THE TOP
BUT AT LEAST HE UNDERSTOOD AFTER A FEW CONVERSATIONS WITH MISTER HAVISHAM THAT HE COULD GRATIFY ALL HIS NEAREST WISHES AND HE PROCEEDED TO GRATIFY THEM WITH A SIMPLICITY AND DELIGHT WHICH CAUSED MISTER HAVISHAM MUCH DIVERSION
AND ALL THE CASTLE FOLK WERE FED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE EARL AND THE COUNTESS OXEN AND SHEEP WERE ROASTED WHOLE HUGE SUET PUDDINGS MADE OF BARLEY MEAL SWEETENED WITH HONEY AND STUFFED WITH PLUMS WERE BOILED IN GREAT CALDRONS IN THE OPEN COURTYARD
FOR A WEEK AFTERWARDS THE CASTLE WAS FED UPON THE REMAINS OF THE GOOD THINGS LEFT FROM THAT GREAT FEAST UNTIL EVERYONE GREW TO LOATHE FINE VICTUALS AND LONGED FOR HONEST BEEF AND MUSTARD AGAIN THEN AT LAST IN THAT CONSTANT CHANGE THE WINTER WAS GONE
FROM HIS OLDEST FRIEND LORD FAUNTLEROY TO MISTER HOBBS WHEN THIS YOU SEE REMEMBER ME I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORGET ME MISTER HOBBS BLEW HIS NOSE VERY LOUDLY AGAIN
AND HE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO TELL WHAT HE FELT JUST THEN IF HE HAD TRIED PERHAPS THAT WAS WHY HE DIDN'T TRY AND ONLY WINKED HIS EYES AND SWALLOWED A LUMP IN HIS THROAT I WISH YE WASN'T GOIN AWAY HE SAID IN A HUSKY VOICE
THE DAINTIEST FARE LACKED IN AFTER YEARS THEN FALL PASSED AND WINTER CAME BLEAK COLD AND DREARY NOT WINTER AS WE KNOW IT NOWADAYS WITH WARM FIRES AND BRIGHT LIGHTS TO MAKE THE LONG NIGHTS SWEET AND CHEERFUL WITH COMFORT
THE SUMMER PASSED AWAY AND THE BLEAK FALL CAME MYLES HAD LONG SINCE ACCEPTED HIS POSITION AS ONE SET APART FROM THE OTHERS OF HIS KIND AND HAD RESIGNED HIMSELF TO THE EVIDENT FACT THAT HE WAS NEVER TO SERVE IN THE HOUSEHOLD IN WAITING UPON THE EARL
BUT EACH WRITE A LETTER TO CEDRIC CONTAINING ASSURANCES OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND SYMPATHY THEY WROTE THOSE LETTERS AS SOON AS THEY COULD AFTER RECEIVING THE NEWS AND AFTER HAVING WRITTEN THEM THEY HANDED THEM OVER TO EACH OTHER TO BE READ
AN ILE SEE NO HARM CUMS TO U ENNY BIG FELER THAT TRISE TO CUM IT OVER U
IT SEEMED ALMOST DIRECTLY THEY WERE ON THE STEAMER IN THE MIDST OF THE WILDEST BUSTLE AND CONFUSION CARRIAGES WERE DRIVING DOWN AND LEAVING PASSENGERS PASSENGERS WERE GETTING INTO A STATE OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT BAGGAGE WHICH HAD NOT ARRIVED AND THREATENED TO BE TOO LATE
AND DICK WAS STARING AT ONE OF THEM WITH HIS EYES AND MOUTH OPEN AND HIS SHARP FACE ALMOST PALE WITH EXCITEMENT WHAT'S TO PAY DICK SAID THE YOUNG MAN WHAT HAS PARALYZED YOU DICK REALLY DID LOOK AS IF SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED
LOOK AT IT PANTED DICK
BUT A BRIGHT ENERGETIC YOUNG FELLOW WITH SHARP WIT AND A GOOD TEMPER HE HAD A SHABBY OFFICE NEAR DICK'S STAND AND EVERY MORNING DICK BLACKED HIS BOOTS FOR HIM AND QUITE OFTEN THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY WATER TIGHT BUT HE ALWAYS HAD A FRIENDLY WORD OR A JOKE FOR DICK
THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK AT SHE AINT NO RISTOCRAT SHE AINT WITH WITHERING SCORN SHE'S NO LORD'S WIFE
I'D COME TO SEE YOU REPLIED MISTER HOBBS GRACIOUSLY SO IT SEEMED TO BE AGREED THAT IF HE RECEIVED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM THE EARL TO COME AND SPEND A FEW MONTHS AT DORINCOURT CASTLE
THE FELLER THAT GIVE ME THE PAPER HE'S A LAWYER LET'S AX HIM WHAT WE'D BETTER DO LAWYERS KNOWS IT ALL MISTER HOBBS WAS IMMENSELY IMPRESSED BY THIS SUGGESTION AND DICK'S BUSINESS CAPACITY
AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED HE ENJOYED IMMENSELY THE EXCITEMENT AND IMPATIENCE OF THAT MOMENT IF LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY COULD ONLY HAVE LOOKED INTO THE STORE THAT MORNING HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN INTERESTED
LADY ALICE THE EARL OF MACKWORTH'S NIECE AND WARD A GREAT HEIRESS IN HER OWN RIGHT A STRIKINGLY PRETTY BLACK EYED GIRL OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN THESE COMPOSED THE EARL'S PERSONAL FAMILY
WHEN THE BUDS SWELLED AND THE LEAVES BURST FORTH ONCE MORE AND CROCUSES AND THEN DAFFODILS GLEAMED IN THE GREEN GRASS LIKE SPARKS AND FLAMES OF GOLD WITH THE SPRING CAME THE OUT DOOR SPORTS OF THE SEASON AMONG OTHERS THAT OF BALL
I SHOULDN'T FORGET YOU WHOEVER I WAS AMONG ANSWERED HIS LORDSHIP I'VE SPENT MY HAPPIEST HOURS WITH YOU AT LEAST SOME OF MY HAPPIEST HOURS I HOPE YOU'LL COME TO SEE ME SOMETIME
AND HE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE HEARTY CHILDISH VOICE CALLING
HE BEGAN TO GATHER HIS BRUSHES AND THINGS TOGETHER AS IF HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WHICH WOULD PUT AN END TO HIS BUSINESS FOR THE PRESENT NEVER MIND HE SAID I KNOW HER AN I'VE STRUCK WORK FOR THIS MORNIN
SHOT IN THEIR SOUTHWARD FLIGHT BY THE LADS AND COOKED BY FAT GOOD NATURED MOTHER JOAN GRACED THE RUDE MESS TABLE OF THE SQUIRES IN THE LONG HALL AND EVEN THE TOUGHEST AND FISHIEST DRAKE SO THE FRUIT OF THEIR SKILL HAD A SAVOR THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER
YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER PEOPLE WHO ARE KIND TO YOU IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIS HONEST SIMPLE LITTLE MIND THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO COULD FORGET KINDNESSES THE INTERVIEW WITH DICK WAS QUITE EXCITING
HAND UNDER HAND UNTIL AT LAST HE HUNG DIRECTLY OVER THE TOP OF THE WALL AND PERHAPS A FOOT ABOVE IT BELOW HIM HE COULD SEE THE LEAFY TOP OF AN ARBOR COVERED WITH A THICK GROWTH OF CLEMATIS AND EVEN AS HE HUNG THERE
BUT AT THE BEST ONLY RUDE STORIES AND JESTS RECITED BY SOME STROLLING MUMMER OR MINSTREL TO THE LISTENING CIRCLE GATHERED AROUND THE BLAZE AND WELCOMING THE COARSE GROSS JESTS AND COARSER GROSSER SONGS WITH ROARS OF BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER
BUT WINTER WITH ALL ITS GRIMNESS AND STERNNESS IN THE GREAT COLD STONE WALLED CASTLES OF THOSE DAYS THE ONLY FIRE AND ALMOST THE ONLY LIGHT WERE THOSE FROM THE HUGE BLAZING LOGS THAT ROARED AND CRACKLED IN THE GREAT OPEN STONE FIREPLACE
EVERY ONE SEEMED TO BE SAYING DON'T FORGET US WRITE WHEN YOU GET TO LIVERPOOL GOOD BYE GOOD BYE LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY LEANED FORWARD AND WAVED THE RED HANDKERCHIEF
I SHA'N'T FORGET YOU HE SAID SPEAKING A TRIFLE HUSKILY AS DICK HAD SPOKEN NOR DON'T YOU GO AND FORGET ME WHEN YOU GET AMONG THE BRITISH ARRYSTOCRACY
BUT BESIDES THEM WAS LORD GEORGE BEAUMONT HIS EARL'S BROTHER AND HIM MYLES SOON CAME TO KNOW BETTER THAN ANY OF THE CHIEF PEOPLE OF THE CASTLE EXCEPTING SIR JAMES LEE FOR SINCE MYLES'S GREAT BATTLE IN THE ARMORY LORD GEORGE
OF COURSE AS SOON AS THE STORY OF LORD FAUNTLEROY AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE EARL OF DORINCOURT WERE DISCUSSED IN THE ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS THEY WERE DISCUSSED IN THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS THE STORY WAS TOO INTERESTING TO BE PASSED OVER LIGHTLY
MYLES HIMSELF WAS AT THE TRAP BAREHANDED AND BAREARMED THE WIND WAS BLOWING FROM BEHIND HIM AND AIDED PERHAPS BY IT HE HAD ALREADY STRUCK THREE OF FOUR BALLS NEARLY THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE COURT AN UNUSUAL DISTANCE
THE POOR FELLOW DROPPED FROM THE WALL INTO THE GARDEN AND WHEN THEY FOUND HIM HE STILL HELD A BUNCH OF FLOWERS IN HIS HAND WHICH HE HAD PERHAPS BEEN GATHERING FOR HIS SWEETHEART HAD MYLES SEEN HIM CARRIED ON A LITTER TO THE INFIRMARY AS GASCOYNE AND SOME OF THE OTHERS HAD DONE
THE LADY ANNE THE DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE A TALL THIN DARK EYED DARK HAIRED HANDSOME YOUNG DAME OF TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE HAWK NOSED LIKE HER FATHER AND SILENT PROUD AND HAUGHTY MYLES HEARD THE SQUIRES SAY
SO NOW THAT THE SUN WAS WARM AND THE WEATHER PLEASANT THE GAME OF TRAP BALL WAS IN FULL SWING EVERY AFTERNOON THE PLAY GROUND BEING AN OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE WALL THAT SURROUNDED THE CASTLE GROUNDS AND THAT OF THE PRIVY GARDEN
WHILE THE CROWS AND THE JACKDAWS LOOKED DOWN AT THEM FROM THE TOP OF THE BLEAK GRAY WALLS THEN AT YULE TIDE WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT OF A RUDE SEMBLANCE TO THE MERRY CHRISTMAS SEASON OF OUR DAY A GREAT FEAST WAS HELD IN THE HALL
SO NO MORE AT PRESENT DICK
AND EVEN THE LADS WHO HAD ENJOYED ITS PASSING WERE GLAD WHEN THE WINDS BLEW WARM ONCE MORE AND THE GRASS SHOWED GREEN IN SUNNY PLACES AND THE LEADER OF THE WILD FOWL BLEW HIS HORN AS THEY WHO IN THE FALL HAD FLOWN TO THE SOUTH FLEW ARROW LIKE NORTHWARD AGAIN
HE LOOKED AT THE PILES OF ROPE AT THE FURLED SAILS AT THE TALL TALL MASTS WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO TOUCH THE HOT BLUE SKY HE BEGAN TO MAKE PLANS FOR CONVERSING WITH THE SAILORS AND GAINING SOME INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT OF PIRATES
THEN HE WINKED HIS EYES AGAIN THEN HE LOOKED AT MISTER HAVISHAM AND TOUCHED HIS CAP THANKY SIR FUR BRINGIN HIM DOWN HERE AN FUR WOT YE'VE DONE HE'S HE'S A QUEER LITTLE FELLER HE ADDED I'VE ALLERS THORT A HEAP OF HIM
AND THE SECOND TO BENJAMIN TIPTON
THE VERY NEXT MORNING ONE OF DICK'S CUSTOMERS WAS RATHER SURPRISED HE WAS A YOUNG LAWYER JUST BEGINNING PRACTICE AS POOR AS A VERY YOUNG LAWYER CAN POSSIBLY BE
WHEN THE CARRIAGE STOOD AT THE DOOR THEN A CURIOUS FEELING OF LONELINESS CAME UPON THE LITTLE BOY HIS MAMMA HAD BEEN SHUT UP IN HER ROOM FOR SOME TIME WHEN SHE CAME DOWN THE STAIRS HER EYES LOOKED LARGE AND WET AND HER SWEET MOUTH WAS TREMBLING
SILAS HOBBS WELL SAID MISTER HOBBS HE'S PERVIDED FOR BETWEEN US IF HE AINT A EARL SO HE IS SAID DICK I'D HA STOOD BY HIM BLEST IF I DIDN'T LIKE THAT LITTLE FELLER FUST RATE
NOW AT THE LOWER EXTREMITY OF THE COURT AND ABOUT TWELVE OR FIFTEEN FEET DISTANT FROM THE GARDEN WALL THERE GREW A PEAR TREE SOME OF THE BRANCHES OF WHICH OVERHUNG INTO THE GARDEN BEYOND SO FIRST MAKING SURE THAT NO ONE WAS LOOKING THAT WAY
HE NOTICED THE BROAD SMOOTH WALKS THE GRASSY TERRACE IN FRONT OF THE COUNTESS'S APARTMENTS IN THE DISTANCE THE QUAINT FLOWER BEDS THE YEW TREES TRIMMED INTO ODD SHAPES AND EVEN THE DEAF OLD GARDENER WORKING BARE ARMED IN THE SUNLIGHT AT A FLOWER BED IN THE FAR CORNER BY THE TOOL HOUSE
AN WE SAY HOLD ON AS LONGS U KIN
THERE IS A LOT OF OLE THEVES WIL MAKE AL THEY KIN OF U
AN IF THERE AINT NO BETTER WAY CUM OVER HERE AN GO IN PARDNERS WITH ME
THE STATEMENT THAT HIS OLD FRIEND HAD BECOME A LORD AND WAS IN DANGER OF BEING AN EARL IF HE LIVED LONG ENOUGH CAUSED DICK TO SO OPEN HIS EYES AND MOUTH AND START THAT HIS CAP FELL OFF WHEN HE PICKED IT UP HE UTTERED A RATHER SINGULAR EXCLAMATION
AND ACTUALLY BEFORE THE SUN WENT DOWN TWO LETTERS HAD BEEN WRITTEN AND SENT IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS ONE SPEEDING OUT OF NEW YORK HARBOR ON A MAIL STEAMER ON ITS WAY TO ENGLAND AND THE OTHER ON A TRAIN CARRYING LETTERS AND PASSENGERS BOUND FOR CALIFORNIA
FOR BOYS WERE BOYS AND PLAYED AT BALL EVEN IN THOSE FARAWAY DAYS A GAME CALLED TRAP BALL EVEN YET IN SOME PARTS OF ENGLAND IT IS PLAYED JUST AS IT WAS IN MYLES FALWORTH'S DAY AND ENJOYED JUST AS MYLES AND HIS FRIENDS ENJOYED IT
FOR THE PRINCELY NOBLES OF THOSE DAYS LIVED IN STATE LITTLE LESS ROYAL THAN ROYALTY ITSELF MOST OF THE KNIGHTS AND GENTLEMEN MYLES SOON CAME TO KNOW BY SIGHT MEETING THEM IN LORD GEORGE'S APARTMENTS IN THE SOUTH WING OF THE GREAT HOUSE
AND SOME OF THEM FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF LORD GEORGE SINGLED HIM OUT FOR FRIENDLY NOTICE GIVING HIM A NOD OR A WORD IN PASSING EVERY SEASON HAS ITS PLEASURES FOR BOYS AND THE CONSTANT CHANGE THAT THEY BRING IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DELIGHTS OF BOYHOOD'S DAYS
PROFESSOR DICK TIPTON HAD ALWAYS BEEN A SHARP BOY AND EARNING HIS LIVING IN THE STREETS OF A BIG CITY HAD MADE HIM STILL SHARPER HE HAD LEARNED TO KEEP HIS EYES OPEN AND HIS WITS ABOUT HIM
AND WAS KEPT ABSOLUTELY PRIVATE FOR THE USE OF THE COUNTESS AND HER FAMILY ONLY A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE MYLES HAD FIRST COME TO DEVLEN ONE OF THE COOK'S MEN HAD BEEN FOUND CLIMBING THE WALL WHEREUPON THE SOLDIER WHO SAW HIM SHOT HIM WITH HIS CROSS BOW
IT'S A HANKERCHER HE POURED IT ALL FORTH AS IF IN ONE SENTENCE A BELL RANG AND HE MADE A LEAP AWAY BEFORE CEDRIC HAD TIME TO SPEAK GOOD BYE HE PANTED WEAR IT WHEN YE GET AMONG THE SWELLS AND HE DARTED OFF AND WAS GONE
IT WAS OF BRIGHT RED SILK ORNAMENTED WITH PURPLE HORSESHOES AND HORSES HEADS THERE WAS A GREAT STRAINING AND CREAKING AND CONFUSION THE PEOPLE ON THE WHARF BEGAN TO SHOUT TO THEIR FRIENDS AND THE PEOPLE ON THE STEAMER SHOUTED BACK
HE'S VERY KIND IF HE IS AN EARL AND HE SENT ME A LOT OF MONEY BY MISTER HAVISHAM AND I'VE BROUGHT SOME TO YOU TO BUY JAKE OUT
WHEN THE SODDEN SNOW IS FIT FOR NOTHING BUT TO MAKE SNOWBALLS OF THRICE THAT BITTER WINTER THE MOAT WAS FROZEN OVER AND THE LADS MAKING THEMSELVES SKATES OF MARROW BONES WHICH THEY BOUGHT FROM THE HALL COOK AT A GROAT A PAIR WENT SKIMMING OVER THE SMOOTH SURFACE
YET BLEAK AND DREARY AS WAS THE WINTER IN THOSE DAYS AND COLD AND BITING AS WAS THE FROST IN THE CHEERLESS WINDY HALLS AND CORRIDORS OF THE CASTLE IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS JOYS TO THE YOUNG LADS FOR THEN AS NOW BOYS COULD FIND PLEASURE EVEN IN SLUSHY WEATHER
HE'S SUCH A GAME LITTLE FELLER AN' AN SUCH A QUEER LITTLE UN AND WHEN THEY TURNED AWAY HE STOOD AND LOOKED AFTER THEM IN A DAZED KIND OF WAY AND THERE WAS STILL A MIST IN HIS EYES AND A LUMP IN HIS THROAT
THE OTHER LADS WERE SOMETIMES OCCUPIED BY THEIR HOUSEHOLD DUTIES WHEN SPORTS WERE AFOOT IN WHICH THEY WOULD LIKED TO HAVE TAKEN PART MYLES WAS ALWAYS FREE TO ENTER INTO ANY MATTER OF THE KIND AFTER HIS DAILY EXERCISE HAD BEEN PERFORMED AT THE PELS THE BUTTS OR THE TILTING COURT
HE CAME UP TO CEDRIC QUITE BREATHLESS I'VE RUN ALL THE WAY HE SAID I'VE COME DOWN TO SEE YE OFF TRADE'S BEEN PRIME
AS HE THREW THE PAPER DOWN ON THE COUNTER HELLO
MUCH TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S ASTONISHMENT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN A VERY YOUNG LAWYER WITH A VERY ENTERPRISING MIND AND A GREAT DEAL OF SPARE TIME ON HIS HANDS HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SO READILY INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY
WHOLE BARRELS OF ALE AND MALMSEY WERE BROACHED AND ALL THE FOLK GENTLE AND SIMPLE WERE BIDDEN TO THE FEAST AFTERWARDS THE MINSTRELS DANCED AND PLAYED A RUDE PLAY AND IN THE EVENING A MIRACLE SHOW WAS PERFORMED ON A RAISED PLATFORM IN THE NORTH HALL
THIS IS WHAT MISTER HOBBS READ IN DICK'S LETTER DERE FREND
A FEW SECONDS LATER THEY SAW HIM STRUGGLE THROUGH THE CROWD ON THE LOWER DECK AND RUSH ON SHORE JUST BEFORE THE GANG PLANK WAS DRAWN IN HE STOOD ON THE WHARF AND WAVED HIS CAP CEDRIC HELD THE HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS HAND
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO DRAW BACK NOW BRACING HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT HE LOOSED HIS HOLD UPON THE LIMB ABOVE THE BRANCH FLEW BACK WITH A RUSH AND HE DROPPED STRIVING TO GRASP THE SLOPING ANGLE WITH HIS FEET
YE KIN WEAR IT WHEN YE GET AMONG THE SWELLS I LOST THE PAPER WHEN I WAS TRYIN TO GET THROUGH THEM FELLERS DOWNSTAIRS
ALL OF US AS WE GROW OLDER HAVE IN OUR MEMORY PICTURES OF BY GONE TIMES THAT ARE SOMEHOW MORE THAN USUALLY VIVID THE COLORS OF SOME NOT BLURRING BY TIME AS OTHERS DO
SO I THINK I DON'T KNOW HOW PAINFUL A PERSON'S BONES CAN BE BUT I'VE SYMPATHIZED WITH YOU A GREAT DEAL AND I HOPE YOU'LL BE BETTER SHE'S A VERY GOOD APPLE WOMAN HE SAID TO MISTER HAVISHAM AS THEY WALKED AWAY
HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT TWICE BEFORE VENTURING TO ENTER THE LADIES PRIVATE GARDEN AS IT WAS HE ONLY SHOOK HIS STUBBORN HEAD AND SAID AGAIN I WILL CLIMB THE WALL AND FETCH IT
MY I KNOW HER BETTER N I KNOW YOU THE YOUNG MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH WHERE DID YOU MEET HER DICK HE SAID AT NEWPORT OR WHEN YOU RAN OVER TO PARIS THE LAST TIME DICK ACTUALLY FORGOT TO GRIN
ONE SAID HE WAS ENGAGED TO A YOUNG LADY OF GREAT BEAUTY WHO WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A DUKE ANOTHER SAID HE HAD JUST BEEN MARRIED THE ONLY THING IN FACT WHICH WAS NOT SAID WAS THAT HE WAS A LITTLE BOY BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT
PUT THEM TWO TOGETHER HER N THAT THERE SCAR WHY THAT THERE BOY O HERS AINT NO MORE A LORD THAN I AM IT'S BEN'S BOY THE LITTLE CHAP SHE HIT WHEN SHE LET FLY THAT PLATE AT ME
WHICH WHEN THE EAST WIND WAS STRAINING FLEW LOW OVERHEAD TO PITCH TO THE LAKE IN THE FORBIDDEN PRECINCTS OF THE DEER PARK BEYOND THE BROW OF THE HILL
LEAVING THE PROPRIETRESS OF THE STALL ALMOST GASPING FOR BREATH AND NOT AT ALL BELIEVING IN HER GREAT FORTUNE ONCE WHEN I FELL DOWN AND CUT MY KNEE SHE GAVE ME AN APPLE FOR NOTHING I'VE ALWAYS REMEMBERED HER FOR IT YOU KNOW
CEDRIC WENT TO HER AND SHE BENT DOWN TO HIM AND HE PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HER AND THEY KISSED EACH OTHER HE KNEW SOMETHING MADE THEM BOTH SORRY THOUGH HE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT IT WAS BUT ONE TENDER LITTLE THOUGHT ROSE TO HIS LIPS
HE WALKED ABOUT LIKE A BOOT BLACK IN A DREAM HE STARED AT HIS YOUNG BENEFACTOR AND FELT AS IF HE MIGHT WAKE UP AT ANY MOMENT HE SCARCELY SEEMED TO REALIZE ANYTHING UNTIL CEDRIC PUT OUT HIS HAND TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM BEFORE GOING AWAY
WHO CAME TO AMERICA TO LOOK FOR THE EARL'S HEIR THEN CAME THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE NEW LORD FAUNTLEROY AND HIS MOTHER SOMETIMES SHE WAS A GYPSY SOMETIMES AN ACTRESS SOMETIMES A BEAUTIFUL SPANIARD
HE LAID THE CASE ON HIS STOUT KNEE AND BLEW HIS NOSE VIOLENTLY SEVERAL TIMES THERE'S SOMETHING WRITTEN ON IT SAID CEDRIC INSIDE THE CASE I TOLD THE MAN MYSELF WHAT TO SAY
THE MORE EXCITED THEY BECAME SEEMS LIKE SOMETHIN ORTER BE DONE SAID MISTER HOBBS THINGS LIKE THEM ORTER BE HELD ON TO EARLS OR NO EARLS BUT THERE REALLY WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO
WOULDST GET THYSELF SHOT WITH A BOLT BETWIXT THE RIBS LIKE POOR DICCON COOK OF ALL PLACES ABOUT THE CASTLE THE PRIVY GARDEN WAS PERHAPS THE MOST SACRED IT WAS A SMALL PLOT OF GROUND ONLY A FEW RODS LONG AND WIDE
WELL GOOD BYE HE SAID AND THOUGH HE TRIED TO SPEAK STEADILY THERE WAS A LITTLE TREMBLE IN HIS VOICE AND HE WINKED HIS BIG BROWN EYES AND I HOPE TRADE'LL BE GOOD I'M SORRY I'M GOING AWAY TO LEAVE YOU
IT WAS JUST AT THE VERY LAST WHEN HE WAS STANDING LEANING ON THE RAILING OF THE UPPER DECK AND WATCHING THE FINAL PREPARATIONS ENJOYING THE EXCITEMENT AND THE SHOUTS OF THE SAILORS AND WHARFMEN
AND FOUND HIMSELF THE POSSESSOR OF THE BUSINESS AND SOME NEW BRUSHES AND A MOST ASTONISHING SIGN AND OUTFIT HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IN HIS GOOD LUCK ANY MORE EASILY THAN THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE COULD BELIEVE IN HERS
AROUND WHICH THE FOLKS GATHERED SHELTERING THEIR FACES AS BEST THEY COULD FROM THE SCORCHING HEAT AND CLOAKING THEIR SHOULDERS FROM THE BITING COLD FOR AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM WHERE GIANT SHADOWS SWAYED AND BOWED AND DANCED HUGE AND BLACK AGAINST THE HIGH WALLS
DICK HAD JUST BEEN HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE WITH JAKE AND WAS IN LOW SPIRITS WHEN THEY SAW HIM HIS AMAZEMENT WHEN CEDRIC CALMLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD COME TO GIVE HIM WHAT SEEMED A VERY GREAT THING TO HIM AND WOULD SET ALL HIS TROUBLES RIGHT
BUT PERHAPS I SHALL COME BACK AGAIN WHEN I'M AN EARL AND I WISH YOU'D WRITE TO ME BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS GOOD FRIENDS AND IF YOU WRITE TO ME HERE'S WHERE YOU MUST SEND YOUR LETTER AND HE GAVE HIM A SLIP OF PAPER
AND THE AFTERNOON THEY SO AMAZED THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE BY STOPPING BEFORE HER STALL AND TELLING HER SHE WAS TO HAVE A TENT AND A STOVE AND A SHAWL AND A SUM OF MONEY WHICH SEEMED TO HER QUITE WONDERFUL
IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD BE A LONG TRIAL WHICH WOULD BE FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN ANYTHING EVER CARRIED INTO COURT BEFORE MISTER HOBBS USED TO READ THE PAPERS UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS IN A WHIRL AND IN THE EVENING HE AND DICK WOULD TALK IT ALL OVER
AND SEVERAL OF THE LADS HAD GONE BACK ALMOST AS FAR AS THE WALL OF THE PRIVY GARDEN TO CATCH ANY BALL THAT MIGHT CHANCE TO FLY AS FAR AS THAT THEN ONCE MORE MYLES STRUCK THROWING ALL HIS STRENGTH INTO THE BLOW THE BALL SHOT UP INTO THE AIR
THAT'S WHO DONE IT SHE WAS ALLERS UP TO HER TRICKS AN I'LL TELL YER WOT COME TO ME THE MINNIT I SAW HER PICTUR THERE WAS ONE O THEM PAPERS WE SAW HAD A LETTER IN IT THAT SAID SOMETHIN BOUT HER BOY AN IT SAID HE HAD A SCAR ON HIS CHIN
IN THE WEEK BEFORE THEY SAILED FOR ENGLAND HE DID MANY CURIOUS THINGS THE LAWYER LONG AFTER REMEMBERED THE MORNING THEY WENT DOWN TOWN TOGETHER TO PAY A VISIT TO DICK
AND IF THE WORST HAPPENS AND THEM EARLS IS TOO MANY FOR US THERES A PARTNERSHIP IN THE GROCERY BUSINESS READY FOR YOU WHEN YURE OLD ENOUGH AND A HOME AND A FRIEND IN
AS HE WATCHED THE GALLANT LITTLE FIGURE MARCHING GAYLY ALONG BY THE SIDE OF ITS TALL RIGID ESCORT UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEPARTURE HIS LORDSHIP SPENT AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE WITH MISTER HOBBS IN THE STORE
ONE OF WHICH IN REMEMBERING ALWAYS FILLED MYLES'S HEART IN AFTER YEARS WITH AN INDEFINABLE PLEASURE WAS THE RECOLLECTION OF STANDING WITH OTHERS OF HIS FELLOW SQUIRES
IT APPEARS THERE HAS BEEN SOME DUBIOUSNESS ABOUT THE CHILD THE WOMAN CONTRADICTED HERSELF IN SOME OF HER STATEMENTS ABOUT HIS AGE AND AROUSED SUSPICION THE FIRST PERSONS TO BE WRITTEN TO ARE DICK'S BROTHER AND THE EARL OF DORINCOURT'S FAMILY LAWYER
FLEW THROUGH HIS BRAIN LIKE A CLOUD OF FLIES AND THEN A LEAFY GREENNESS SEEMED TO STRIKE UP AGAINST HIM A SPLINTERING CRASH SOUNDED IN HIS EARS AS THE LATTICE TOP OF THE ARBOR BROKE UNDER HIM AND WITH ONE FINAL CLUTCH AT THE EMPTY AIR HE FELL HEAVILY UPON THE GROUND BENEATH
THERE BE NO MORE PLAY FOR US UNTIL WE GET ANOTHER BALL THE OUTFIELDERS CAME SLOWLY TROOPING IN UNTIL THEY HAD GATHERED IN A LITTLE CIRCLE AROUND MYLES I COULD NOT HELP IT SAID MYLES IN ANSWER TO THEIR GRUMBLING HOW KNEW I THE BALL WOULD FLY SO FAR
MISTER HOBBS THOUGHT I'D HAD A SUNSTROKE I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO LIKE IT MYSELF BUT I LIKE IT BETTER NOW I'M USED TO IT THE ONE WHO IS THE EARL NOW HE'S MY GRANDPAPA AND HE WANTS ME TO DO ANYTHING I LIKE
WITH HANDSOME LEGS AND CURLY HAIR ONE SAID HE WAS NO RELATION TO THE EARL OF DORINCOURT AT ALL BUT WAS A SMALL IMPOSTOR WHO HAD SOLD NEWSPAPERS AND SLEPT IN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK BEFORE HIS MOTHER IMPOSED UPON THE FAMILY LAWYER
FOR IT ALL CERTAINLY SOUNDED VERY WILD AND QUEER BUT HE CHANCED TO WANT SOMETHING TO DO VERY MUCH AND HE CHANCED TO KNOW DICK AND DICK CHANCED TO SAY HIS SAY IN A VERY SHARP TELLING SORT OF WAY
I BELIEVE ITS A PUT UP JOB AND THEM THATS DONE IT OUGHT TO BE LOOKED AFTER SHARP AND WHAT I WRITE TO SAY IS TWO THINGS
WE LIKED THIS LITTLE HOUSE DEAREST DIDN'T WE HE SAID WE ALWAYS WILL LIKE IT WON'T WE YES YES SHE ANSWERED IN A LOW SWEET VOICE YES DARLING
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF IT THE BISHOP HAD JUST PICKED UP THE BASKET IN A FLOWER BED HE PRESENTED IT
MEANWHILE M MADELEINE HAD RETURNED HOME HE HAD TAKEN THE LONGEST WAY TO RETURN FROM MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE'S AS THOUGH THE PARSONAGE DOOR HAD BEEN A TEMPTATION FOR HIM
HE LAID HIS HAND QUICKLY ON THE KNOCKER AND LIFTED IT THEN HE PAUSED AGAIN AND STOPPED SHORT AS THOUGH IN THOUGHT AND AFTER THE LAPSE OF A FEW SECONDS INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THE KNOCKER TO FALL ABRUPTLY
IT MAKES ONE SHUDDER TO THINK OF IT AS THE BROTHER AND SISTER WERE ABOUT TO RISE FROM THE TABLE THERE CAME A KNOCK AT THE DOOR COME IN SAID THE BISHOP THE DOOR OPENED
HE COULD HEAR AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE ROOM THE EVEN AND TRANQUIL BREATHING OF THE SLEEPING BISHOP HE SUDDENLY CAME TO A HALT HE WAS NEAR THE BED
NOTHING HAD STIRRED THERE HE LENT AN EAR NOTHING WAS MOVING IN THE HOUSE THE NOISE MADE BY THE RUSTY HINGE HAD NOT AWAKENED ANY ONE
THE SHADOW OF THE WINDOW FRAME WAS NOT SHOWN WHICH INDICATED THAT THE WINDOW WAS WIDE OPEN THE FACT THAT THIS WINDOW WAS OPEN IN SUCH COLD WEATHER WAS SURPRISING THE CASHIER FELL ASLEEP AGAIN
HE IS FULL OF FIRE THEY WANTED TO MAKE A SADDLE HORSE OF HIM AT FIRST BAH HE REARED HE KICKED HE LAID EVERYBODY FLAT ON THE GROUND HE WAS THOUGHT TO BE VICIOUS AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM I BOUGHT HIM
AT THIS WORD JEAN VALJEAN WHO WAS DEJECTED AND SEEMED OVERWHELMED
WITH HIS IRON CANDLESTICK IN HIS HAND FRIGHTENED BY THIS LUMINOUS OLD MAN NEVER HAD HE BEHELD ANYTHING LIKE THIS THIS CONFIDENCE TERRIFIED HIM THE MORAL WORLD HAS NO
THIS CLOUD PARTED AS THOUGH ON PURPOSE AND A RAY OF LIGHT TRAVERSING THE LONG WINDOW SUDDENLY ILLUMINATED THE BISHOP'S PALE FACE HE WAS SLEEPING PEACEFULLY
AND THIS PERSON NOTICED THIS AFTER THE MAYOR HAD PASSED THE PRIEST'S HOUSE HE HALTED STOOD MOTIONLESS THEN TURNED ABOUT AND RETRACED HIS STEPS TO THE DOOR OF THE PARSONAGE WHICH HAD AN IRON KNOCKER
HERE AND THERE VAGUE AND CONFUSED FORMS WERE DISTINGUISHABLE WHICH IN THE DAYLIGHT WERE PAPERS SCATTERED ON A TABLE OPEN FOLIOS VOLUMES PILED UPON A STOOL AN ARM CHAIR HEAPED WITH CLOTHING
AT THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES HIS LEFT ARM ROSE SLOWLY TOWARDS HIS BROW AND HE TOOK OFF HIS CAP THEN HIS ARM FELL BACK WITH THE SAME DELIBERATION AND JEAN VALJEAN FELL
AH COME ARE THERE NO SUCH THINGS AS PEWTER FORKS AND SPOONS MADAME MAGLOIRE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS PEWTER HAS AN ODOR IRON FORKS AND SPOONS THEN
DOES YOUR GRACE KNOW WHERE THE BASKET OF SILVER IS YES REPLIED THE BISHOP
TO MEDITATING ONCE MORE HIS CAP IN HIS LEFT HAND HIS CLUB IN HIS RIGHT HAND HIS HAIR BRISTLING ALL OVER HIS SAVAGE HEAD THE BISHOP CONTINUED TO SLEEP IN PROFOUND PEACE
THERE WAS SOMETHING ALMOST DIVINE IN THIS MAN WHO WAS THUS AUGUST WITHOUT BEING HIMSELF AWARE OF IT JEAN VALJEAN WAS IN THE SHADOW AND STOOD MOTIONLESS
FROM THE TOWN HALL HE BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE TOWN TO A FLEMING NAMED MASTER SCAUFFLAER FRENCH SCAUFFLAIRE WHO LET OUT HORSES AND CABRIOLETS AS DESIRED
STRAIGHT TO THE CUPBOARD WHICH HE SAW NEAR THE HEAD HE RAISED HIS IRON CANDLESTICK AS THOUGH TO FORCE THE LOCK THE KEY WAS THERE HE OPENED IT THE FIRST THING WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM WAS THE BASKET OF SILVERWARE
ARE YOUR HORSE'S FORELEGS GOOD SAID M MADELEINE YES MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
BUT NEAR THE DOOR THERE STOOD A LITTLE TABLE WHICH FORMED AN EMBARRASSING ANGLE WITH IT AND BARRED THE ENTRANCE JEAN VALJEAN RECOGNIZED THE DIFFICULTY
AH RETURNED THE BISHOP SO IT IS THE SILVER WHICH TROUBLES YOU I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS GREAT GOOD GOD
SOME ONE WILL BE BY IN THE SECOND PLACE IS THE CABRIOLET FOR MONSIEUR LE MAIRE YES DOES MONSIEUR LE MAIRE KNOW HOW TO DRIVE YES
THE SILVER HAS BEEN STOLEN AS SHE UTTERED THIS EXCLAMATION HER EYES FELL UPON A CORNER OF THE GARDEN WHERE TRACES OF THE WALL HAVING BEEN SCALED WERE VISIBLE THE COPING OF THE WALL HAD BEEN TORN AWAY
IRON HAS A TASTE VERY WELL SAID THE BISHOP WOODEN ONES THEN
WITH AN AIR OF STUPEFACTION MONSEIGNEUR HE MURMURED SO HE IS NOT THE CURE SILENCE SAID THE GENDARME HE IS MONSEIGNEUR THE BISHOP
AS THOUGH SHE DESIRED TO MAKE US REFLECT FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR A LARGE CLOUD HAD COVERED THE HEAVENS
HAS MONSIEUR LE MAIRE REFLECTED THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER M MADELEINE DID NOT REPLY THE FLEMING RESUMED THAT IT IS VERY COLD M MADELEINE PRESERVED SILENCE
OR OF A CANDLE THE WINDOW WAS STILL OPEN
IS MONSIEUR LE MAIRE ILL I THOUGHT HE HAD A RATHER SINGULAR AIR THIS CASHIER OCCUPIED A ROOM SITUATED DIRECTLY UNDER M MADELEINE'S CHAMBER HE PAID NO HEED TO THE PORTRESS'S WORDS BUT WENT TO BED AND TO SLEEP
THE FLEMING CALLED HIS WIFE AND RELATED THE AFFAIR TO HER WHERE THE DEVIL COULD MONSIEUR LE MAIRE BE GOING
AND WITH A NEIGHBOR LIKE HIMSELF HAD ABOUT IT SOMETHING SUBLIME OF WHICH HE WAS VAGUELY BUT IMPERIOUSLY CONSCIOUS NO ONE COULD HAVE TOLD WHAT WAS PASSING WITHIN HIM NOT EVEN HIMSELF
IT WAS NECESSARY AT ANY COST TO ENLARGE THE APERTURE STILL FURTHER HE DECIDED ON HIS COURSE OF ACTION AND GAVE THE DOOR A THIRD PUSH MORE ENERGETIC THAN THE TWO PRECEDING
ARE THERE MANY DESCENDS BETWEEN HERE AND THE PLACE WHITHER YOU ARE GOING DO NOT FORGET TO BE AT MY DOOR AT PRECISELY HALF PAST FOUR O'CLOCK TO MORROW MORNING REPLIED M MADELEINE AND HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE
WAS A STRANGE INDECISION ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS HESITATING BETWEEN THE TWO ABYSSES THE ONE IN WHICH ONE LOSES ONE'S SELF AND THAT IN WHICH ONE SAVES ONE'S SELF
OF THAT IRRITATED HINGE SHOULD NOT HAVE DISTURBED THE ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD LIKE THE SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE THE DOOR PUSHED BY HIM HAD TAKEN THE ALARM AND HAD SHOUTED THE OLD MAN WOULD RISE AT ONCE THE TWO OLD WOMEN WOULD SHRIEK OUT
AND WHICH AT THAT HOUR WERE ONLY SHADOWY CORNERS AND WHITISH SPOTS JEAN VALJEAN ADVANCED WITH PRECAUTION TAKING CARE NOT TO KNOCK AGAINST THE FURNITURE
WELL MONSIEUR LE MAIRE WILL TRAVEL ALONE AND WITHOUT BAGGAGE IN ORDER NOT TO OVERLOAD THE HORSE AGREED BUT AS MONSIEUR LE MAIRE WILL HAVE NO ONE WITH HIM HE WILL BE OBLIGED TO TAKE THE TROUBLE HIMSELF
ANOTHER SILENCE ENSUED THEN THE BISHOP WENT ON
PEOPLE WOULD COME TO THEIR ASSISTANCE IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE TOWN WOULD BE IN AN UPROAR AND THE GENDARMERIE ON HAND FOR A MOMENT HE THOUGHT HIMSELF LOST
AND PARDON FOR THE OTHER SUDDENLY JEAN VALJEAN REPLACED HIS CAP ON HIS BROW THEN STEPPED RAPIDLY PAST THE BED
HE REMAINED WHERE HE WAS PETRIFIED LIKE THE STATUE OF SALT NOT DARING TO MAKE A MOVEMENT SEVERAL MINUTES ELAPSED THE DOOR HAD FALLEN WIDE OPEN HE VENTURED TO PEEP INTO THE NEXT ROOM
HIS HEAD WAS THROWN BACK ON THE PILLOW IN THE CARELESS ATTITUDE OF REPOSE HIS HAND ADORNED WITH THE PASTORAL RING AND WHENCE HAD FALLEN SO MANY GOOD DEEDS AND SO MANY HOLY ACTIONS WAS HANGING OVER THE EDGE OF THE BED
OF A LIGHTED WINDOW REFLECTED ON THE OPPOSITE WALL FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE RAYS IT COULD ONLY COME FROM THE WINDOW OF M MADELEINE'S CHAMBER THE REFLECTION WAVERED AS THOUGH IT CAME RATHER FROM A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN LIGHTED THAN FROM A CANDLE
IT WAS A SORT OF HAGGARD ASTONISHMENT HE GAZED AT IT AND THAT WAS ALL BUT WHAT WAS HIS THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DIVINE IT WHAT WAS EVIDENT WAS
SAID ONE OF THE GENDARMES MY FRIEND RESUMED THE BISHOP BEFORE YOU GO HERE ARE YOUR CANDLESTICKS TAKE THEM HE STEPPED TO THE CHIMNEY PIECE TOOK THE TWO SILVER CANDLESTICKS AND BROUGHT THEM TO JEAN VALJEAN
A SINGULAR AND VIOLENT GROUP MADE ITS APPEARANCE ON THE THRESHOLD THREE MEN WERE HOLDING A FOURTH MAN BY THE COLLAR THE THREE MEN WERE GENDARMES THE OTHER WAS JEAN VALJEAN
MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE HE INQUIRED HAVE YOU A GOOD HORSE MISTER MAYOR SAID THE FLEMING ALL MY HORSES ARE GOOD WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY A GOOD HORSE
WHICH THE BASKET HAD BROKEN AS IT FELL ACROSS THE BED HE ROSE UP AT MADAME MAGLOIRE'S CRY
AND IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS THAT SILVER OURS
OF COURSE MONSIEUR LE MAIRE REPLIED SCAUFFLAIRE THEN SCRATCHING A SPECK IN THE WOOD OF THE TABLE WITH HIS THUMB NAIL HE RESUMED WITH THAT CARELESS AIR WHICH THE FLEMINGS UNDERSTAND SO WELL HOW TO MINGLE WITH THEIR SHREWDNESS
THE DEUCE SAID THE FLEMING TWENTY LEAGUES YES
NEVERTHELESS THE PORTRESS OF THE FACTORY WHO WAS AT THE SAME TIME M MADELEINE'S ONLY SERVANT NOTICED THAT THE LATTER'S LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED AT HALF PAST EIGHT AND SHE MENTIONED IT TO THE CASHIER WHEN HE CAME HOME ADDING
BUT HOW IS THIS I GAVE YOU THE CANDLESTICKS TOO WHICH ARE OF SILVER LIKE THE REST AND FOR WHICH YOU CAN CERTAINLY GET TWO HUNDRED FRANCS
GRANDER SPECTACLE THAN THIS A TROUBLED AND UNEASY CONSCIENCE WHICH HAS ARRIVED ON THE BRINK OF AN EVIL ACTION CONTEMPLATING THE SLUMBER OF THE JUST THAT SLUMBER IN THAT ISOLATION
WAS GRUMBLING UNDER HER BREATH THAT ONE REALLY DOES NOT NEED EITHER FORK OR SPOON EVEN OF WOOD IN ORDER TO DIP A BIT OF BREAD IN A CUP OF MILK
WHAT HE DOES JEAN VALJEAN LISTENED NOT A SOUND HE GAVE THE DOOR A PUSH HE PUSHED IT GENTLY WITH THE TIP OF HIS FINGER
HERE IT IS M MADELEINE LAID A BANK BILL ON THE TABLE THEN LEFT THE ROOM AND THIS TIME HE DID NOT RETURN MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE EXPERIENCED A FRIGHTFUL REGRET THAT HE HAD NOT SAID A THOUSAND FRANCS
MONSIEUR LE MAIRE HAS NOT TOLD ME WHERE HE IS GOING WHERE IS MONSIEUR LE MAIRE GOING HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF NOTHING ELSE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION BUT HE DID NOT KNOW WHY HE HAD NOT DARED TO PUT THE QUESTION
YOU MAY RETIRE GENTLEMEN THE GENDARMES RETIRED JEAN VALJEAN WAS LIKE A MAN ON THE POINT OF FAINTING THE BISHOP DREW NEAR TO HIM AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE
BENEATH THAT TERRIFYING GAZE THE GLEAM OF THE MOON RENDERED CONFUSEDLY VISIBLE THE CRUCIFIX OVER THE CHIMNEY PIECE WHICH SEEMED TO BE EXTENDING ITS ARMS TO BOTH OF THEM WITH A BENEDICTION FOR ONE
SAID THE WIFE I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID THE HUSBAND M MADELEINE HAD FORGOTTEN THE PAPER WITH THE FIGURES ON IT AND IT LAY ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE THE FLEMING PICKED IT UP AND STUDIED IT FIVE SIX
DO NOT FORGET NEVER FORGET THAT YOU HAVE PROMISED TO USE THIS MONEY IN BECOMING AN HONEST MAN
THE BISHOP WORKS THE NEXT MORNING AT SUNRISE MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU WAS STROLLING IN HIS GARDEN
NOW SAID THE BISHOP GO IN PEACE BY THE WAY WHEN YOU RETURN MY FRIEND IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO PASS THROUGH THE GARDEN YOU CAN ALWAYS ENTER AND DEPART THROUGH THE STREET DOOR
AND ENVELOPED IN A SORT OF SERENE AND MAJESTIC
IN THE MEANTIME MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU HAD ADVANCED AS QUICKLY AS HIS GREAT AGE PERMITTED AH HERE YOU ARE HE EXCLAIMED LOOKING AT JEAN VALJEAN I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU WELL
THE FLEMING REMAINED UTTERLY STUPID AS HE HIMSELF SAID SOME TIME AFTERWARDS THE MAYOR HAD BEEN GONE TWO OR THREE MINUTES WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN IT WAS THE MAYOR ONCE MORE
IN ORDER TO REACH THIS SCAUFFLAIRE THE SHORTEST WAY WAS TO TAKE THE LITTLE FREQUENTED STREET IN WHICH WAS SITUATED THE PARSONAGE OF THE PARISH IN WHICH M MADELEINE RESIDED
HE BORE UPON HIS BROW THE INDESCRIBABLE REFLECTION OF A LIGHT WHICH WAS INVISIBLE THE SOUL OF THE JUST CONTEMPLATES IN SLEEP A MYSTERIOUS HEAVEN
YES AND HOW LONG CAN HE REST AT THE END OF HIS JOURNEY HE MUST BE ABLE TO SET OUT AGAIN ON THE NEXT DAY IF NECESSARY TO TRAVERSE THE SAME ROAD YES THE DEUCE THE DEUCE
CARRY NO WE MUST SUPPOSE THAT IS WHAT HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND HE WILL ACCOMPLISH THE TRIP YOUR TWENTY LEAGUES ALL AT A FULL TROT AND IN LESS THAN EIGHT HOURS BUT HERE ARE THE CONDITIONS
THIS FIRST DANGER WAS PAST BUT THERE STILL REIGNED A FRIGHTFUL TUMULT WITHIN HIM NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT RETREAT EVEN WHEN HE HAD THOUGHT HIMSELF LOST HE HAD NOT DRAWN BACK
A REFLECTION OF THAT HEAVEN RESTED ON THE BISHOP IT WAS AT THE SAME TIME A LUMINOUS TRANSPARENCY
AND ASTOUNDED BUT WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THIS EMOTION HIS EYE NEVER QUITTED THE OLD MAN THE ONLY THING WHICH WAS CLEARLY TO BE INFERRED FROM HIS ATTITUDE
HE ASCENDED TO HIS ROOM AND THERE HE SHUT HIMSELF UP WHICH WAS A VERY SIMPLE ACT
A BRIGADIER OF GENDARMES WHO SEEMED TO BE IN COMMAND OF THE GROUP WAS STANDING NEAR THE DOOR HE ENTERED AND ADVANCED TO THE BISHOP MAKING A MILITARY SALUTE MONSEIGNEUR SAID HE
WITH WHOM HE HAD PASSED THE NIGHT I SEE HOW THE MATTER STANDS AND YOU HAVE BROUGHT HIM BACK HERE IT IS A MISTAKE IN THAT CASE REPLIED THE BRIGADIER WE CAN LET HIM GO CERTAINLY REPLIED THE BISHOP
IT IS NEVER FASTENED WITH ANYTHING BUT A LATCH EITHER BY DAY OR BY NIGHT
EIGHT AND A HALF THAT MUST DESIGNATE THE POSTING RELAYS HE TURNED TO HIS WIFE I HAVE FOUND OUT WHAT IT IS FIVE LEAGUES FROM HERE TO HESDIN
SO WHAT THIS MAN SAID IS TRUE THEN WE CAME ACROSS HIM HE WAS WALKING LIKE A MAN WHO IS RUNNING AWAY WE STOPPED HIM TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER HE HAD THIS SILVER AND HE TOLD YOU INTERPOSED THE BISHOP WITH A SMILE
BUT I WISH TO GUARANTEE YOU IN ANY CASE YOU SHALL GIVE ME BACK THE SUM AT MY RETURN AT WHAT VALUE DO YOU ESTIMATE YOUR HORSE AND CABRIOLET FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS MONSIEUR LE MAIRE
HIS ONLY THOUGHT NOW WAS TO FINISH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE TOOK A STEP AND ENTERED THE ROOM THIS ROOM WAS IN A STATE OF PERFECT CALM
AND HOW FORTUNATE THAT HE DID NOTHING BUT STEAL AH
THE TWO WOMEN LOOKED ON WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD WITHOUT A GESTURE WITHOUT A LOOK WHICH COULD DISCONCERT THE BISHOP JEAN VALJEAN WAS TREMBLING IN EVERY LIMB
AND WOULD FATIGUE THE HORSE MONSIEUR LE MAIRE MUST CONSENT TO TRAVEL IN A LITTLE TILBURY THAT I OWN I CONSENT TO THAT IT IS LIGHT BUT IT HAS NO COVER THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME
AND THAT IT WAS BARKING LIKE A DOG TO AROUSE EVERY ONE AND WARN AND TO WAKE THOSE WHO WERE ASLEEP HE HALTED SHUDDERING BEWILDERED AND FELL BACK FROM THE TIPS OF HIS TOES UPON HIS HEELS
THAT SLUMBERING NATURE THAT GARDEN WITHOUT A QUIVER THAT HOUSE WHICH WAS SO CALM THE HOUR THE MOMENT THE SILENCE ADDED SOME SOLEMN AND UNSPEAKABLE QUALITY TO THE VENERABLE REPOSE OF THIS MAN
YOU SEE HE SAID TOTAL NINETEEN AND A HALF
AND RECOGNIZED M MADELEINE'S STEP THIS STRUCK HIM AS STRANGE USUALLY THERE WAS NO NOISE IN M MADELEINE'S CHAMBER UNTIL HE ROSE IN THE MORNING A MOMENT LATER THE CASHIER HEARD A NOISE WHICH RESEMBLED THAT OF A CUPBOARD BEING OPENED
I HAVE FOR A LONG TIME DETAINED THAT SILVER WRONGFULLY IT BELONGED TO THE POOR WHO WAS THAT MAN A POOR MAN EVIDENTLY
IN ORDER TO ATTEMPT TO FORM AN IDEA OF IT IT IS NECESSARY TO THINK OF THE MOST VIOLENT OF THINGS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MOST GENTLE EVEN ON HIS VISAGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY
THIS TIME A BADLY OILED HINGE SUDDENLY EMITTED AMID THE SILENCE A HOARSE AND PROLONGED CRY JEAN VALJEAN SHUDDERED THE NOISE OF THE HINGE RANG IN HIS EARS WITH SOMETHING OF THE PIERCING AND FORMIDABLE SOUND
AND IT IS TWENTY LEAGUES M MADELEINE DREW FROM HIS POCKET THE PAPER ON WHICH HE HAD PENCILLED SOME FIGURES HE SHOWED IT TO THE FLEMING THE FIGURES WERE FIVE SIX EIGHT AND A HALF
THE GENDARMES RELEASED JEAN VALJEAN WHO RECOILED IS IT TRUE THAT I AM TO BE RELEASED HE SAID IN AN ALMOST INARTICULATE VOICE AND AS THOUGH HE WERE TALKING IN HIS SLEEP
HE WAITED A MOMENT THEN GAVE THE DOOR A SECOND AND A BOLDER PUSH IT CONTINUED TO YIELD IN SILENCE THE OPENING WAS NOW LARGE ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIM TO PASS
IN A TWINKLING WITH ALL THE VIVACITY OF AN ALERT OLD WOMAN
BELONG TO EVIL BUT TO GOOD IT IS YOUR SOUL THAT I BUY FROM YOU
STATE THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU WILL GIVE HIM HALF AN HOUR'S BREATHING SPELL MIDWAY OF THE ROAD HE WILL EAT AND SOME ONE MUST BE BY WHILE HE IS EATING TO PREVENT THE STABLE BOY OF THE INN FROM STEALING HIS OATS
AT WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAD SAT ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING
HE SEEMED PREPARED TO CRUSH THAT SKULL
MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE CONTINUED THAT IT MAY RAIN M MADELEINE RAISED HIS HEAD AND SAID THE TILBURY AND THE HORSE WILL BE IN FRONT OF MY DOOR TO MORROW MORNING AT HALF PAST FOUR O'CLOCK
HE HAD ARRIVED THERE SOONER THAN HE HAD THOUGHT FOR NATURE SOMETIMES MINGLES HER EFFECTS AND HER SPECTACLES WITH OUR ACTIONS WITH SOMBRE AND INTELLIGENT APPROPRIATENESS
M MADELEINE DREW THREE NAPOLEONS FROM HIS PURSE AND LAID THEM ON THE TABLE HERE IS THE PAY FOR TWO DAYS IN ADVANCE FOURTHLY FOR SUCH A JOURNEY A CABRIOLET WOULD BE TOO HEAVY
ENTERED THE ALCOVE AND RETURNED TO THE BISHOP THE BISHOP HAD JUST BENT DOWN AND WAS SIGHING
OF SEEING THAT THE OATS ARE NOT STOLEN THAT IS UNDERSTOOD I AM TO HAVE THIRTY FRANCS A DAY THE DAYS OF REST TO BE PAID FOR ALSO NOT A FARTHING LESS AND THE BEAST'S FOOD TO BE AT MONSIEUR LE MAIRE'S EXPENSE
THE BISHOP REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT THEN HE RAISED HIS GRAVE EYES
HE HEARD THE ARTERIES IN HIS TEMPLES BEATING LIKE TWO FORGE HAMMERS AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HIS BREATH ISSUED FROM HIS BREAST WITH THE ROAR OF THE WIND ISSUING FROM A CAVERN IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM THAT THE HORRIBLE CLAMOR
THE ONE BEARING THE OTHER THE ONE DRAGGING THE OTHER MONSIEUR LE MAIRE SAID THE FLEMING WITH A BROAD SMILE SO BE IT WELL DOES MONSIEUR LE MAIRE WISH TO PURCHASE THEM OR ME NO
JEAN VALJEAN OPENED HIS EYES WIDE AND STARED AT THE VENERABLE BISHOP WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH NO HUMAN TONGUE CAN RENDER ANY ACCOUNT OF MONSEIGNEUR SAID THE BRIGADIER OF GENDARMES
LIGHTLY WITH THE FURTIVE AND UNEASY GENTLENESS OF A CAT WHICH IS DESIROUS OF ENTERING THE DOOR YIELDED TO THIS PRESSURE AND MADE AN IMPERCEPTIBLE AND SILENT MOVEMENT WHICH ENLARGED THE OPENING A LITTLE
IN HIS SLEEP HE HAD HEARD A NOISE ABOVE HIS HEAD HE LISTENED IT WAS A FOOTSTEP PACING BACK AND FORTH AS THOUGH SOME ONE WERE WALKING IN THE ROOM ABOVE HIM HE LISTENED MORE ATTENTIVELY
THAT IS WHAT HE WANTED SIR HE IS AS GENTLE AS A GIRL HE GOES LIKE THE WIND AH INDEED HE MUST NOT BE MOUNTED IT DOES NOT SUIT HIS IDEAS TO BE A SADDLE HORSE EVERY ONE HAS HIS AMBITION DRAW YES
THE CURE WAS IT WAS SAID A WORTHY RESPECTABLE AND SENSIBLE MAN AT THE MOMENT WHEN M MADELEINE ARRIVED IN FRONT OF THE PARSONAGE THERE WAS BUT ONE PASSER BY IN THE STREET
HE STILL WORE THE SAME IMPASSIVE AND PREOCCUPIED AIR MONSIEUR SCAUFFLAIRE SAID HE
HE LAY IN HIS BED ALMOST COMPLETELY DRESSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE COLD OF THE BASSES ALPS IN A GARMENT OF BROWN WOOL
HIS WHOLE FACE WAS ILLUMINED WITH A VAGUE EXPRESSION OF SATISFACTION OF HOPE AND OF FELICITY IT WAS MORE THAN A SMILE AND ALMOST A RADIANCE
MISTER MAYOR RETURNED THE FLEMING I HAVE JUST WHAT YOU WANT MY LITTLE WHITE HORSE YOU MAY HAVE SEEN HIM PASS OCCASIONALLY
THOSE CLOSED EYES THAT FACE IN WHICH ALL WAS HOPE AND ALL WAS CONFIDENCE THAT HEAD OF AN OLD MAN AND THAT SLUMBER OF AN INFANT
IN THE FANTASTIC EXAGGERATIONS OF THE FIRST MOMENT HE ALMOST IMAGINED THAT THAT HINGE HAD JUST BECOME ANIMATED AND HAD SUDDENLY ASSUMED A TERRIBLE LIFE
AND THEN SHUT AGAIN THEN A PIECE OF FURNITURE WAS DISARRANGED THEN A PAUSE ENSUED THEN THE STEP BEGAN AGAIN THE CASHIER SAT UP IN BED QUITE AWAKE NOW AND STARING AND THROUGH HIS WINDOW PANES HE SAW THE REDDISH GLEAM
AN HOUR OR TWO LATER HE WAKED AGAIN THE SAME STEP WAS STILL PASSING SLOWLY AND REGULARLY BACK AND FORTH OVERHEAD THE REFLECTION WAS STILL VISIBLE ON THE WALL BUT NOW IT WAS PALE AND PEACEFUL LIKE THE REFLECTION OF A LAMP
HERE IT IS
HE PLACED IT GENTLY AND RESUMED HIS WAY WITH A SORT OF HASTE WHICH HAD NOT BEEN APPARENT PREVIOUSLY M MADELEINE FOUND MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE AT HOME ENGAGED IN STITCHING A HARNESS OVER
HE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN HE MET FRIEND FOX ON HIS ROUNDS THAT WAY GOOD MORNING NEIGHBOUR SAYS THE FRIEND WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO SO EARLY I AM GOING TO THE KING FOR WHAT HE OWES ME OH TAKE ME WITH THEE
AND HE WANTS TO SEE THE HOSPITALS AND YOU WANT TO STUDY A BIT OF MUSIC AND YOUR MOTHER WANTS REST AND JASPER AND PHRONSIE AND I WANT FUN SO WE'RE GOING THAT'S ALL WHEN DEMANDED POLLY BREATHLESSLY
HEARD HIM AGAIN RECLAIMING HIS MONEY HE BECAME LIVID WITH RAGE HE COMMANDED THAT THE FURNACE SHOULD BE HEATED AND THIS TAIL OF A DRAKE THROWN INTO IT BECAUSE HE MUST BE A SORCERER THE FURNACE WAS SOON HOT
NO I WON'T SAID DICK IT SMELLS AWFULLY AND I'VE HAD SO MUCH OF IT FOR MY LEG I'M ALL RIGHT PHRONSIE SEE HIS WINGS NOW HE'S STRETCHING BUT PHRONSIE WAS NOT TO BE DIVERTED FROM HER PURPOSE
I AM LOST SAID DRAKESTAIL TO HIMSELF WHEN BY GOOD LUCK HE REMEMBERS HIS COMRADE FRIEND FOX AND HE CRIES
AND THAT IT WOULD BE A PLEASANT SPECTACLE WHEN THE PEOPLE OF HAMEL HEARD OF THE BARGAIN THEY TOO EXCLAIMED A GROS A HEAD BUT THIS WILL COST US A DEAL OF MONEY LEAVE IT TO THE TOWN COUNSELLOR SAID THE TOWN COUNCIL WITH A MALICIOUS AIR
HER HAIR BLOWN OVER HER ROSY CHEEKS AS THEY DANCED LIGHTLY DOWN THE LONG HALL DOCTOR FISHER LEANED AGAINST A PILLAR AND WATCHED THEM HAVE TO SAID JASPER

DRAKESTAIL DRAKESTAIL WAS VERY LITTLE THAT IS WHY HE WAS CALLED DRAKESTAIL BUT TINY AS HE WAS HE HAD BRAINS AND HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT FOR HAVING BEGUN WITH NOTHING HE ENDED BY AMASSING A HUNDRED CROWNS
HE'S NO BEAUTY AND THAT'S A FACT I'VE SEEN THAT FELLOW ROUND HERE FOR MANY A DAY SAID MICHAEL GIVING THE RECUMBENT LEGS A SMALL KICK
INTO THE WELL TO MAKE AN END OF HIM AND IT WAS DONE AS HE COMMANDED DRAKESTAIL WAS IN DESPAIR OF GETTING HIMSELF OUT OF SUCH A DEEP HOLE WHEN HE REMEMBERED HIS LADY FRIEND THE LADDER LADDER LADDER COME OUT OF THY HOLD OR DRAKESTAIL'S DAYS WILL SOON BE TOLD
HAPPILY HE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS STILL ONE REMAINING FRIEND AND HE CRIED WITH DYING ACCENTS WASP'S NEST WASP'S NEST MAKE A SALLY

WITH ALL HIS WASPS THEY THREW THEMSELVES ON THE INFURIATED KING AND HIS MINISTERS AND STUNG THEM SO FIERCELY IN THE FACE THAT THEY LOST THEIR HEADS AND NOT KNOWING WHERE TO HIDE THEMSELVES THEY ALL JUMPED PELL MELL FROM THE WINDOW AND BROKE THEIR NECKS ON THE PAVEMENT
DOCTOR FISHER MADE HASTE TO ANSWER POLLY MISSUS WHITNEY WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM AND JASPER LED HER OFF INTO THE DANCE AGAIN HOW CAN WE EVER LEAVE THE BOYS OH I DON'T SEE CRIED POLLY A BIT REPROACHFULLY
AS IF BY A MIRACLE ONE WAS BANDY LEGGED AND COULD NOT RUN FAST ENOUGH THE OTHER WHO HAD LEFT THE HOUSE IN HASTE ONE FOOT SHOD THE OTHER BARE HAD HURT HIMSELF AGAINST A BIG STONE AND COULD NOT WALK WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE THIRD HAD ARRIVED IN TIME
TISN'T MANLY TO BE FIXED UP PHRONSIE GAVE A SIGH WHICH SO WENT TO DICK'S HEART THAT HE SAID ALL RIGHT BRING ON SOME WATER IF YOU WANT TO
AND THE POULTRY WOMAN CAME TO TELL HIM WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON IN THE YARD HE WAS TERRIBLY ANNOYED
IF YOU MAKE A NOISE I'LL KILL YOU DECLARED A MAN STANDING IN THE SHADOW OF A PORTIERE AND WATCHING HER UNDERNEATH A SLOUCHED BLACK HAT THERE WAS A SLIGHT CLICK THAT CAUSED THE LISTENER'S NERVES TO THRILL
SEARCH FOR THE DOOR FLING THEMSELVES INTO THE STREET AND TRIP TRIP TRIP BEGIN TO RUN IN FILE TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE TOWN HALL SO SQUEEZED TOGETHER THAT THEY COVERED THE PAVEMENT LIKE THE WAVES OF FLOODED TORRENT
THE RATCATCHER DID NOT EXPECT THIS TREACHEROUS STROKE HE PALED WITH ANGER AND HIS EYES FLASHED FIRE THE HEADS CRIED HE IF YOU CARE ABOUT THEM GO AND FIND THEM IN THE RIVER SO REPLIED THE TOWN COUNSELLOR
AND LEFT FILE HE TAKES THE SAME ROAD TO JOIN THE OTHERS WITH ALL HIS PARTY THERE WAS NOT MUCH MORE ROOM BUT BY CLOSING UP A BIT THEY MANAGED AND DRAKESTAIL IS OFF AGAIN SINGING

IT WAS FIRST A SLOW CARESSING SOUND THEN MORE AND MORE LIVELY AND URGENT
HAD STRUCK SO VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE WALL OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT HE FELL BACKWARDS AT THE MOMENT IT CLOSED UPON HIS COMRADES AT THIS STORY THE PARENTS REDOUBLED THEIR LAMENTATIONS THEY RAN WITH PIKES AND MATTOCKS TO THE MOUNTAIN AND SEARCHED TILL EVENING
TO FIND THE OPENING BY WHICH THEIR CHILDREN HAD DISAPPEARED WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO FIND IT AT LAST THE NIGHT FALLING
TRANSYLVANIA WHERE THE INHABITANTS ONLY SPOKE GERMAN WHILE ALL AROUND THEM NOTHING WAS SPOKEN BUT HUNGARIAN THESE PEOPLE ALSO DECLARED THAT THEY CAME FROM GERMANY BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW THEY CHANCED TO BE IN THIS STRANGE COUNTRY

YOU REFUSE TO HOLD TO THE TERMS OF YOUR AGREEMENT WE OURSELVES COULD REFUSE YOU ALL PAYMENT
WHEN THE HAMEL PEOPLE HEARD HOW THE AFFAIR HAD ENDED THEY RUBBED THEIR HANDS AND WITH NO MORE SCRUPLE THAN THEIR TOWN COUNSELLOR THEY LAUGHED OVER THE RATCATCHER WHO THEY SAID WAS CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP
I MIND YEES YER SEE WITH ANOTHER ATTENTION FROM HIS GARDENING BOOT I WANT TO TIE ONE ROPE CRIED A VOICE DICK OPENED HIS EYES RUBBED THEM
THE BIRD FLYING OVER HIS HEAD AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE BOY DISCONCERTED THE ROBBER FOR ONE INSTANT HE HELD THE LONG WHITE HAND IN HIS TEARING OFF THE RINGS THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HER TO ESCAPE SHE KNEW BUT SHE COULD SAVE DICK

AND EVERYWHERE IN THE CEILINGS IN THE FLOORS IN THE CUPBOARDS AT THE DOORS THERE WAS A CHASE AND A RUMMAGE AND SO FURIOUS A NOISE OF GIMLETS PINCERS AND SAWS THAT A DEAF MAN COULD NOT HAVE RESTED FOR ONE HOUR TOGETHER
SAY MY GIRL AND THEN BEFORE SHE COULD ANSWER HE WENT ON YOU SEE WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT A DOCTOR ON OUR TRAVELS NOW PROVIDENCE HAS GIVEN US ONE THOUGH RATHER AN OBSTINATE SPECIMEN HE POINTED TO FATHER FISHER
THE RATS TOOK THE LEAP SWAM STRAIGHT TO THE FUNNEL PLUNGED IN HEAD FOREMOST AND DISAPPEARED THE PLUNGING CONTINUED THUS WITHOUT CEASING TILL MIDNIGHT AT LAST DRAGGING HIMSELF WITH DIFFICULTY CAME A BIG RAT
AND FEELING FATIGUED HE SAT HIMSELF DOWN ON IT TO THINK OVER HIS ADVENTURE IN THE MEANWHILE THE PEOPLE HAD FOUND THEIR KING AND HIS MINISTERS WITH THEIR FEET IN THE AIR ON THE PAVEMENT AND THEY HAD GONE INTO THE PALACE TO KNOW HOW IT HAD OCCURRED
AND GET REPAID SO ONE FINE MORNING DRAKESTAIL VERY SPRUCE AND FRESH TAKES THE ROAD SINGING QUACK QUACK QUACK WHEN SHALL I GET MY MONEY BACK
THE NEXT MORNING AT NINE O'CLOCK THE BAGPIPER REPAIRED TO THE TOWN HALL WHERE THE TOWN COUNCIL AWAITED HIM ALL YOUR RATS TOOK A JUMP INTO THE RIVER YESTERDAY SAID HE TO THE COUNSELLORS AND I GUARANTEE THAT NOT ONE OF THEM COMES BACK THEY WERE

TO ESCAPE HORTENSE'S PRYING EYES IN MAKING THE MOVEMENT SHE GAVE A SWEEPING GLANCE OUT THE WINDOW SHOULD SHE DARE TO SCREAM MICHAEL WAS BUSY ON THE LAWN SHE KNEW SHE COULD HEAR HIS VOICE TALKING TO ONE OF THE UNDER GARDENERS
WELL RECKONED WELL RECKONED
AND WHISTLED A STRAUSS WALTZ THEREUPON A MOST EXTRAORDINARY HOPPING UP AND DOWN THE HALL WAS COMMENCED THE TWO FIGURES BOBBING LIKE A PAIR OF CORKS ON A QUIVERING WATER SURFACE
WHERE ARE YOU DICK CRIED POLLY'S VOICE OUTSIDE AND RAPPING AT THE DOOR MISSUS CHATTERTON HAVE YOU SEEN HIM COME IN CALLED MISSUS CHATTERTON WITH FIRMEST OF FINGERS ON THE TRIGGER
AND THE GOOD PEOPLE OF HAMEL REPEATED WITH THEIR COUNSELLORS LEAVE IT TO THE TOWN COUNSELLOR
THE SECRET MISSUS CHATTERTON STANDING BY HER TOILET TABLE CAREFULLY EXAMINING HER WEALTH OF GRAY HAIR TO NOTE THE CHANGES IN ITS TINT
I WILL SAYS HE BUT WITH YOUR BATTALION TO DRAG ALONG YOU WILL SOON BE TIRED MAKE YOURSELF QUITE SMALL GO INTO MY THROAT GET INTO MY GIZZARD AND I WILL CARRY YOU
CRIED POLLY SLIPPING OUT FROM UNDER THE DOCTOR'S PALMS AND SEIZING THE TWO HANDS EXTENDED SHE BEGAN TO SPIN AROUND AS IN THE OLDEN DAYS DID YOU EVER EVER HEAR OF ANYTHING SO PERFECTLY MAGNIFICENT
AND RETREATS OF THE TOWN SOON FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CELLARS THE TOP OF THE GARRETS FROM UNDER ALL THE FURNITURE FROM ALL THE NOOKS AND CORNERS OF THE HOUSES
AND QUACK QUACK QUACK DRAKESTAIL IS OFF AGAIN SINGING AND SPRUCE AS BEFORE A LITTLE FARTHER HE MEETS HIS SWEETHEART MY FRIEND RIVER WANDERING QUIETLY IN THE SUNSHINE THOU MY CHERUB SAYS SHE
HAPPY THOUGHT SAYS MY FRIEND LADDER
SAID MISSUS CHATTERTON WITH EVIDENT RELUCTANCE HANDING THE BOX DESIGNATED
MANOEUVRING HIS WASPS
ATTRACTED BY THE MAGIC SOUNDS AND HAD RUSHED TO THE GREAT MARKET PLACE THERE THEY FOUND THE RATCATCHER PLAYING HIS BAGPIPES AT THE SAME SPOT AS THE EVENING BEFORE THEN THE STRANGER HAD BEGUN TO WALK QUICKLY AND THEY HAD FOLLOWED RUNNING SINGING AND DANCING TO THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC
BEHOLD DRAKESTAIL MUCH ASTONISHED ALL ALONE IN THE BIG SALOON AND MASTER OF THE FIELD HE COULD NOT GET OVER IT NEVERTHELESS HE REMEMBERED SHORTLY WHAT HE HAD COME FOR TO THE PALACE AND IMPROVING THE OCCASION
HE SET TO WORK TO HUNT FOR HIS DEAR MONEY BUT IN VAIN HE RUMMAGED IN ALL THE DRAWERS HE FOUND NOTHING ALL HAD BEEN SPENT
NOW THE KING OF THE COUNTRY WHO WAS VERY EXTRAVAGANT AND NEVER KEPT ANY MONEY HAVING HEARD THAT DRAKESTAIL HAD SOME WENT ONE DAY IN HIS OWN PERSON TO BORROW HIS HOARD
HEREUPON THE SCENE CHANGES
NEXT DAY WHICH WAS A SUNDAY THEY ALL WENT GAILY TO CHURCH THINKING THAT AFTER MASS THEY WOULD AT LAST BE ABLE TO EAT SOME GOOD THING THAT THE RATS HAD NOT TASTED BEFORE THEM
ISN'T HE LOVELY CRIED PHRONSIE TEARING HER GAZE OFF FROM THE WONDERFUL WINGS AS THE SWALLOW FLUTTERED UNDER THE MOSQUITO NETTING SPEEDILY BROUGHT IN YES HIS WINGS ARE SAID POLLY OH DICK DO TELL OVER AGAIN HOW IT ALL HAPPENED
HE STRIKES WITH THE KNOCKER TOC TOC WHO IS THERE ASKS THE PORTER PUTTING HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WICKET TIS I DRAKESTAIL I WISH TO SPEAK TO THE KING SPEAK TO THE KING
BUT THERE'S A HEART WITHIN THIS BREAST AND I WILL LEND YOU FIFTY MORE NOT SO WAS PETER'S MILD REPLY HIS CHEEKS ALL WET WITH GRATEFUL TEARS NO MAN RECALLS SO WELL AS I YOUR SERVICES IN BYGONE YEARS
WELL SAID PETER WITH A SIGH HAND ME THE CASH AND I WILL GO I'LL FORM A JOINT STOCK COMPANY AND TURN AN HONEST POUND OR SO I'M GRIEVED SAID PAUL TO SEEM UNKIND THE MONEY SHALT OF COURSE BE LENT BUT FOR A WEEK OR TWO I FIND IT WILL NOT BE CONVENIENT
THE LONGER I THOUGHT OVER THIS STRANGE ADVENTURE THE MORE HOPELESSLY TANGLED THE MYSTERY BECAME AND IT WAS A REAL RELIEF TO MEET ARTHUR IN THE ROAD AND GET HIM TO GO WITH ME UP TO THE HALL TO LEARN WHAT NEWS THE TELEGRAPH HAD BROUGHT I TOLD HIM AS WE WENT WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THE STATION
SHE SAID QUITE LOUD OF COURSE NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT DOTTY WANTS AND LITTLE DOLLY SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AND SAID WITH A PRETTY PETTISHNESS NOW FATHER YOU'RE NOT TO TEASE YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO BE BRIDE'S MAID TO ANYBODY AND DOLLY'S TO BE THE FOURTH WAS HER FATHER'S IDIOTIC REPLY
PAUL BUSTLED IN TO HAVE A CHAT AND GRASPED HIS HAND WITH FRIENDLY ZEAL I KNEW SAID HE YOUR FRUGAL WAYS SO THAT I MIGHT NOT WOUND YOUR PRIDE BY BRINGING STRANGERS IN TO GAZE I'VE LEFT MY LEGAL FRIEND OUTSIDE
DELIGHTFUL POWER OF MAGIC I THOUGHT HOW MUCH OF HUMAN SUFFERING I HAVE NOT ONLY RELIEVED BUT ACTUALLY ANNIHILATED AND IN A GLOW OF CONSCIOUS VIRTUE
HERE NUMBER THREE PUT IN HER OAR OH IT IS SETTLED MOTHER DEAR REALLY AND TRULY MARY TOLD US ALL ABOUT IT IT'S TO BE NEXT TUESDAY FOUR WEEKS AND THREE OF HER COUSINS ARE COMING TO BE BRIDE'S MAIDS AND SHE DOESN'T FORGET IT MINNIE THE MOTHER LAUGHINGLY REPLIED
RESOLVED TO GUARD THE TREASURE EVEN AT THE SACRIFICE OF LIFE AND A FRONT DOOR STANDING INVITINGLY HALF OPEN HERE IS MY CHANCE I THOUGHT FOR TESTING THE REVERSE ACTION OF THE MAGIC WATCH I PRESSED THE REVERSAL PEG AND WALKED IN
THEIR MOTHER SAID COME THAT'S DONE AT LAST YOU MAY FOLD UP YOUR WORK GIRLS BUT THE CHILDREN TOOK NO NOTICE WHATEVER OF THE REMARK ON THE CONTRARY THEY SET TO WORK AT ONCE SEWING IF THAT IS THE PROPER WORD TO DESCRIBE AN OPERATION SUCH AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE WITNESSED
WISHING GOOD BYE TO MISTER I FORGET HIS NAME OF COURSE WE LOOKED THE OTHER WAY BY THIS TIME I WAS SO HOPELESSLY CONFUSED THAT I GAVE UP LISTENING AND FOLLOWED THE DINNER DOWN INTO THE KITCHEN
YOU WELL REMEMBER I AM SURE WHEN FIRST YOUR WEALTH BEGAN TO GO AND PEOPLE SNEERED AT ONE SO POOR I NEVER USED MY PETER SO AND WHEN YOU'D LOST YOUR LITTLE ALL AND FOUND YOURSELF A THING DESPISED I NEED NOT ASK YOU TO RECALL HOW TENDERLY I SYMPATHISED
IT SEEMED BETTER TO WAIT TILL TIME THAT GENTLE HEALER OF OUR BITTEREST SORROWS SHOULD HAVE HELPED HIM TO RECOVER FROM THE FIRST SHOCK OF THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HAD BLIGHTED HIS LIFE BUSINESS HOWEVER SOON DEMANDED MY PRESENCE IN TOWN
EACH OF THEM THREADED HER NEEDLE WITH A SHORT END OF THREAD ATTACHED TO THE WORK WHICH WAS INSTANTLY PULLED BY AN INVISIBLE FORCE THROUGH THE STUFF DRAGGING THE NEEDLE AFTER IT THE NIMBLE FINGERS OF THE LITTLE SEMPSTRESS CAUGHT IT AT THE OTHER SIDE BUT ONLY TO LOSE IT AGAIN THE NEXT MOMENT
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO ACCEPT A POST IN INDIA THAT HAS BEEN OFFERED ME
THIS STYLE OF BUSINESS SEEMS TO ME EXTREMELY INCONVENIENT NO NOBLENESS OF SOUL HAVE I LIKE SOME THAT IN THIS AGE ARE FOUND
BUT WHEN AT LENGTH THE LEGAL SOUL RESUMED ITS CUSTOMARY FORCE THE LAW HE SAID WE CA'N'T CONTROL PAY OR THE LAW MUST TAKE ITS COURSE SAID PAUL HOW BITTERLY I RUE THAT FATAL MORNING WHEN I CALLED CONSIDER PETER WHAT YOU DO
I STOOD WATCHING THE UNLOADING OF THE CART STILL HOLDING THE MAGIC WATCH OPEN IN MY HAND AS I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN WE AGAIN REACHED THE EXACT TIME AT WHICH I HAD PUT BACK THE HAND
I WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT I FREELY CONFESS IF I HAD NOT SEEN IT WITH MY OWN EYES THEN WHY SHOULD I EXPECT IT OF MY READER WHO QUITE POSSIBLY HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING OF THE SORT
NOW IS MY TIME I SAID TO MYSELF AS I MOVED BACK THE HAND OF THE WATCH AND SAW ALMOST WITHOUT SURPRISE THIS TIME
AND TOOK THE SEAWARD ROAD THAT LED TO MY LODGINGS THE GOOD I FANCIED I COULD DO IS VANISHED LIKE A DREAM THE EVIL OF THIS TROUBLESOME WORLD IS THE ONLY ABIDING REALITY
HOWEVER THE PARTY WITH THE ADDITION OF A GENTLEMAN AS GOOD NATURED AND AS ROSY AS THE CHILDREN SEATED THEMSELVES AT IT VERY CONTENTEDLY YOU HAVE SEEN PEOPLE EATING CHERRY TART AND EVERY NOW AND THEN CAUTIOUSLY CONVEYING A CHERRY STONE FROM THEIR LIPS TO THEIR PLATES
IN FACT HE CLIMBED UP INTO SYLVIE'S LAP AS HE SPOKE AND RESTED HIS HEAD AGAINST HER SHOULDER
IT BEGAN BY THE YOUNGEST GIRL SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT PROVOCATION ADDRESSING HER ELDEST SISTER OH YOU WICKED STORY TELLER SHE SAID I EXPECTED A SHARP REPLY FROM THE SISTER BUT INSTEAD OF THIS SHE TURNED LAUGHINGLY TO HER FATHER AND SAID IN A VERY LOUD STAGE WHISPER
THE ACCIDENT I WAS IMAGINING OCCURRED A LIGHT CART WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE GREAT MILLINERY DEPOT OF ELVESTON LADEN WITH CARD BOARD PACKING CASES WHICH THE DRIVER WAS CARRYING INTO THE SHOP ONE BY ONE
HIS FLOWING LOCKS HE WILDLY TORE AND VERY SOON HIS YELLOW HAIR WAS LYING ALL ABOUT THE FLOOR THE LEGAL FRIEND WAS STANDING BY WITH SUDDEN PITY HALF UNMANNED THE TEAR DROP TREMBLED IN HIS EYE THE SIGNED AGREEMENT IN HIS HAND
AND IN THE ACT OF STARTING WHILE OH WOE FOR THE GOLDEN DREAM OF WORLD WIDE BENEVOLENCE THAT HAD DAZZLED MY DREAMING FANCY THE WOUNDED YOUTH WAS ONCE MORE RECLINING ON THE HEAP OF PILLOWS HIS PALE FACE SET RIGIDLY IN THE HARD LINES THAT TOLD OF PAIN RESOLUTELY ENDURED
SAID PAUL IT FILLS ME WITH SURPRISE TO HEAR YOU TALK IN SUCH A TONE I FEAR YOU SCARCELY REALISE THE BLESSINGS THAT ARE ALL YOUR OWN YOU'RE SAFE FROM BEING OVERFED YOU'RE SWEETLY PICTURESQUE IN RAGS YOU NEVER KNOW THE ACHING HEAD THAT COMES ALONG WITH MONEY BAGS
THE EARL SEEMED TO SHARE MY SURPRISE WHO SPOKE HE EXCLAIMED IT WAS I SAID ARTHUR LOOKING AT US WITH A WORN HAGGARD FACE AND EYES FROM WHICH THE LIGHT OF LIFE SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE FADED
IN ANOTHER HOUSE THE ENTRANCE OF A STRANGER MIGHT CAUSE SURPRISE PERHAPS ANGER EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO EXPEL THE SAID STRANGER WITH VIOLENCE BUT HERE I KNEW NOTHING OF THE SORT COULD HAPPEN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF EVENTS FIRST TO THINK NOTHING ABOUT ME
I COULD NEVER BE HAPPY WITH MY CHILD MARRIED TO A MAN WITHOUT AN OBJECT TO LIVE FOR WITHOUT EVEN AN OBJECT TO DIE FOR I HOPE THEY WILL BE HAPPY A STRANGE VOICE SAID THE SPEAKER WAS EVIDENTLY IN THE ROOM BUT I HAD NOT HEARD THE DOOR OPEN AND I LOOKED ROUND IN SOME ASTONISHMENT
I HELPED THEM IN EMPTYING THE CART AND PLACING IN IT SOME PILLOWS FOR THE WOUNDED MAN TO REST ON AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE DRIVER HAD MOUNTED TO HIS PLACE AND WAS STARTING FOR THE SURGERY THAT I BETHOUGHT ME OF THE STRANGE POWER I POSSESSED OF UNDOING ALL THIS HARM
THE EARL WAS SITTING ALONE WHEN WE ENTERED I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME IN TO KEEP ME COMPANY HE SAID MURIEL IS GONE TO BED THE EXCITEMENT OF THAT TERRIBLE SCENE WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER
I FOUND THEY WERE REALLY WALKING BACKWARDS WHILE THEIR MOTHER SEATED BY THE FIRE WITH SOME NEEDLEWORK ON HER LAP WAS SAYING JUST AS I ENTERED THE ROOM NOW GIRLS YOU MAY GET YOUR THINGS ON FOR A WALK TO MY UTTER ASTONISHMENT FOR I WAS NOT YET ACCUSTOMED TO THE ACTION OF THE WATCH
IT IS NOT QUITE CONVENIENT THE FOURTH ARRIVED AND PUNCTUAL PAUL CAME WITH HIS LEGAL FRIEND AT NOON I THOUGHT IT BEST SAID HE TO CALL ONE CANNOT SETTLE THINGS TOO SOON POOR PETER SHUDDERED IN DESPAIR
AND IN TRYING TO AVOID RUNNING OVER THE BOX UPSET HIS MACHINE AND WAS THROWN HEADLONG AGAINST THE WHEEL OF THE SPRING CART THE DRIVER RAN OUT TO HIS ASSISTANCE AND HE AND I TOGETHER RAISED THE UNFORTUNATE CYCLIST AND CARRIED HIM INTO THE SHOP
THEN HEARING MY FOOTSTEPS TO LOOK UP AND SEE ME AND THEN TO WONDER WHAT BUSINESS I HAD THERE WOULD BE REVERSED BY THE ACTION OF MY WATCH THEY WOULD FIRST WONDER WHO I WAS THEN SEE ME THEN LOOK DOWN AND THINK NO MORE ABOUT ME AND AS TO BEING EXPELLED WITH VIOLENCE
SO WEEK BY WEEK POOR PETER CAME AND TURNED IN HEAVINESS AWAY FOR STILL THE ANSWER WAS THE SAME I CANNOT MANAGE IT TO DAY AND NOW THE APRIL SHOWERS WERE DRY THE FIVE SHORT WEEKS WERE NEARLY SPENT YET STILL HE GOT THE OLD REPLY
ALL SMILES CEASED AS BROWNING SAYS ON THE FOUR PRETTY FACES AND THEY ALL GOT OUT PIECES OF NEEDLE WORK AND SAT DOWN NO ONE NOTICED ME IN THE LEAST AS I QUIETLY TOOK A CHAIR AND SAT DOWN TO WATCH THEM WHEN THE NEEDLE WORK HAD BEEN UNFOLDED AND THEY WERE ALL READY TO BEGIN
I DO WISH THEY'D GET IT SETTLED I DON'T LIKE LONG ENGAGEMENTS AND MINNIE WOUND UP THE CONVERSATION IF SO CHAOTIC A SERIES OF REMARKS DESERVES THE NAME WITH ONLY THINK WE PASSED THE CEDARS THIS MORNING JUST EXACTLY AS MARY DAVENANT WAS STANDING AT THE GATE
AND AT LAST THEY PARTED I WAITED TILL THEY WERE SOME TWENTY YARDS APART AND THEN PUT THE WATCH A MINUTE BACK THE INSTANTANEOUS CHANGE WAS STARTLING THE TWO FIGURES SEEMED TO FLASH BACK INTO THEIR FORMER PLACES ISN'T SUITED SHE CAN BUT COOM BACK
HE SIGHED TO FIND THE STATE OF THINGS GROW LESS AND LESS CONVENIENT WEEKS GREW TO MONTHS AND MONTHS TO YEARS PETER WAS WORN TO SKIN AND BONE
AND NOW THAT HE HAS ARRANGED MATTERS WITH MURIEL HE HAS BUSINESS IN TOWN THAT MUST BE SEEN TO AT ONCE WHAT ARRANGEMENT DO YOU MEAN I ASKED WITH A SINKING HEART AS THE THOUGHT OF ARTHUR'S CRUSHED HOPES CAME TO MY MIND
HOW FEW IN THIS COLD AGE OF GREED DO GOOD EXCEPT ON SELFISH GROUNDS BUT I CAN FEEL FOR PETER'S NEED AND I WILL LEND HIM FIFTY POUNDS HOW GREAT WAS PETER'S JOY TO FIND HIS FRIEND IN SUCH A GENIAL VEIN
YOU QUITE UNDERSTAND IT NOW DON'T YOU HE ADDED LOOKING KINDLY AT BRUNO WHO WAS SITTING AT SYLVIE'S SIDE ON THE FLOOR YES SAID BRUNO VERY QUIETLY SUCH A SHORT SPEECH WAS VERY UNUSUAL FOR HIM BUT JUST THEN HE SEEMED I FANCIED A LITTLE EXHAUSTED
MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO ME THE HEART KNOWETH ITS OWN BITTERNESS I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THOSE WORDS TILL NOW THE NEXT FEW DAYS PASSED WEARILY ENOUGH I FELT NO INCLINATION TO CALL BY MYSELF AT THE HALL STILL LESS TO PROPOSE THAT ARTHUR SHOULD GO WITH ME
WHAT NEED TO TELL HOW THE MUTTON WAS PLACED ON THE SPIT AND SLOWLY UNROASTED HOW THE POTATOES WERE WRAPPED IN THEIR SKINS AND HANDED OVER TO THE GARDENER TO BE BURIED HOW WHEN THE MUTTON HAD AT LENGTH ATTAINED TO RAWNESS THE FIRE WHICH HAD GRADUALLY CHANGED FROM RED HEAT TO A MERE BLAZE
WAS HANDED UP TO THE PRESIDING GENTLEMAN WHO QUIETLY REPLACED THE SLICE ON THE JOINT AND THE POTATOES IN THE DISH THEIR CONVERSATION WAS IF POSSIBLE MORE BEWILDERING THAN THEIR MODE OF DINING
DO YOU MEAN THAT THEY ARE ENGAGED THEY HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A SENSE FOR TWO YEARS THE OLD MAN GENTLY REPLIED THAT IS HE HAS HAD MY PROMISE TO CONSENT TO IT SO SOON AS HE COULD SECURE A PERMANENT AND SETTLED LINE IN LIFE
ONCE IN THE WEEK I JUST CONTRIVE TO GET MY WHISKERS OILED AND CURLED BUT MY ASSETS ARE VERY LOW MY LITTLE INCOME'S OVERSPENT TO TRENCH ON CAPITAL YOU KNOW IS ALWAYS INCONVENIENT
AND YOU HAVE TIME TO CULTIVATE THAT BEST OF QUALITIES CONTENT FOR WHICH YOU'LL FIND YOUR PRESENT STATE REMARKABLY CONVENIENT SAID PETER THOUGH I CANNOT SOUND THE DEPTHS OF SUCH A MAN AS YOU YET IN YOUR CHARACTER I'VE FOUND AN INCONSISTENCY OR TWO
AND START AGAIN WITH ANOTHER SHORT END AT LAST ALL THE WORK WAS PICKED TO PIECES AND PUT AWAY AND THE LADY LED THE WAY INTO THE NEXT ROOM WALKING BACKWARDS AND MAKING THE INSANE REMARK NOT YET DEAR WE MUST GET THE SEWING DONE FIRST
DIED DOWN SO SUDDENLY THAT THE COOK HAD ONLY JUST TIME TO CATCH ITS LAST FLICKER ON THE END OF A MATCH OR HOW THE MAID HAVING TAKEN THE MUTTON OFF THE SPIT CARRIED IT BACKWARDS OF COURSE OUT OF THE HOUSE TO MEET THE BUTCHER WHO WAS COMING ALSO BACKWARDS DOWN THE ROAD
BUT I HOPE TO RUN DOWN AGAIN IN A MONTH I ADDED I WOULD STAY NOW IF I COULD I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD FOR YOU TO BE ALONE
THIS DEBT WILL SIMPLY SWALLOW ALL AND MAKE MY LIFE A LIFE OF WOE NAY NAY NAY PETER ANSWERED PAUL YOU MUST NOT RAIL ON FORTUNE SO YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT AND DRINK YOU ARE RESPECTED IN THE WORLD
TO BE A BRIDE THE FATHER IN ORDER TO DO HIS PART IN A CONVERSATION THAT SEEMED ONLY FIT FOR LUNATICS REPLIED WHISPER IT TO ME DEAR BUT SHE DIDN'T WHISPER THESE CHILDREN NEVER DID ANYTHING THEY WERE TOLD
AS I WAS SAYING THE OTHER PROFESSOR RESUMED IF YOU'LL JUST THINK OVER ANY POEM THAT CONTAINS THE WORDS SUCH AS PETER IS POOR SAID NOBLE PAUL AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HIS FRIEND AND THOUGH MY MEANS TO GIVE ARE SMALL AT LEAST I CAN AFFORD TO LEND
YOU SEEM TO HAVE LONG YEARS TO SPARE WHEN THERE'S A PROMISE TO FULFIL AND YET HOW PUNCTUAL YOU WERE IN CALLING WITH THAT LITTLE BILL ONE CAN'T BE TOO DELIBERATE SAID PAUL IN PARTING WITH ONE'S PELF WITH BILLS AS YOU CORRECTLY STATE I'M PUNCTUALITY ITSELF
BUT PAY YOUR DEBTS CRIED HONEST PAUL MY GENTLE PETER PAY YOUR DEBTS WHAT MATTER IF IT SWALLOWS ALL THAT YOU DESCRIBE AS YOUR ASSETS ALREADY YOU'RE AN HOUR BEHIND YET GENEROSITY IS BEST
AFTER WHICH I WAS NOT SURPRISED TO SEE THE CHILDREN SKIPPING BACKWARDS AFTER HER EXCLAIMING OH MOTHER IT IS SUCH A LOVELY DAY FOR A WALK IN THE DINING ROOM THE TABLE HAD ONLY DIRTY PLATES AND EMPTY DISHES ON IT
AND NOW I MUST RECORD AN EXPERIENCE SO STRANGE THAT I THINK IT ONLY FAIR BEFORE BEGINNING TO RELATE IT TO RELEASE MY MUCH ENDURING READER FROM ANY OBLIGATION HE MAY FEEL TO BELIEVE THIS PART OF MY STORY
AN EMPTY FORK IS RAISED TO THE LIPS THERE IT RECEIVES A NEATLY CUT PIECE OF MUTTON AND SWIFTLY CONVEYS IT TO THE PLATE WHERE IT INSTANTLY ATTACHES ITSELF TO THE MUTTON ALREADY THERE SOON ONE OF THE PLATES FURNISHED WITH A COMPLETE SLICE OF MUTTON AND TWO POTATOES
AND SO THE WORK WENT ON STEADILY UNDOING ITSELF AND THE NEATLY STITCHED LITTLE DRESSES OR WHATEVER THEY WERE STEADILY FALLING TO PIECES NOW AND THEN ONE OF THE CHILDREN WOULD PAUSE AS THE RECOVERED THREAD BECAME INCONVENIENTLY LONG WIND IT ON A BOBBIN
THE RESULT WAS ONE THAT IF ONLY I HAD CONSIDERED THE THING CAREFULLY I MIGHT HAVE FORESEEN AS THE HAND OF THE WATCH TOUCHED THE MARK THE SPRING CART WHICH HAD DRIVEN OFF AND WAS BY THIS TIME HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET WAS BACK AGAIN AT THE DOOR
ONE OF THE CASES HAD FALLEN INTO THE STREET BUT IT SCARCELY SEEMED WORTH WHILE TO STEP FORWARD AND PICK IT UP AS THE MAN WOULD BE BACK AGAIN IN A MOMENT YET IN THAT MOMENT A YOUNG MAN RIDING A BICYCLE CAME SHARP ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET
A SILENCE FOLLOWED THEN I ROSE FEELING SURE THAT ARTHUR WOULD WISH TO BE ALONE AND BADE OUR GENTLE HOST GOOD NIGHT ARTHUR TOOK HIS HAND BUT SAID NOTHING NOR DID HE SPEAK AGAIN AS WE WENT HOME TILL WE WERE IN THE HOUSE AND HAD LIT OUR BED ROOM CANDLES THEN HE SAID
GOOD NIGHT AY THEY ARE THAT GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT
AND AT THE BARBER'S AS I THINK YOU OFTEN GET YOUR WHISKERS CURLED THOUGH NOBLENESS YOU CA'N'T ATTAIN TO ANY VERY GREAT EXTENT THE PATH OF HONESTY IS PLAIN HOWEVER INCONVENIENT TIS TRUE SAID PETER I'M ALIVE I KEEP MY STATION IN THE WORLD
NAY AH WINNA FORGET AN IF SHE ISN'T SUITED SHE CAN BUT COOM BACK GOOD NIGHT A CASUAL OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT AND THERE ENDS THE DIALOGUE THAT CASUAL OBSERVER WOULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN
THE PARTY IN THE DRAWING ROOM I HAD WALKED STRAIGHT IN YOU UNDERSTAND WITHOUT RINGING THE BELL OR GIVING ANY NOTICE OF MY APPROACH CONSISTED OF FOUR LAUGHING ROSY CHILDREN OF AGES FROM ABOUT FOURTEEN DOWN TO TEN WHO WERE APPARENTLY ALL COMING TOWARDS THE DOOR
THEY'LL NOT TREAT HER BAD YER MAY DEPEND
INSTANTLY I STEPPED OUT INTO THE STREET PICKED UP THE BOX AND REPLACED IT IN THE CART IN THE NEXT MOMENT THE BICYCLE HAD SPUN ROUND THE CORNER PASSED THE CART WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE AND SOON VANISHED IN THE DISTANCE IN A CLOUD OF DUST
GOOD NIGHT ONE OF THEM WAS SAYING AND SO THE WHOLE DIALOGUE WAS REPEATED AND WHEN THEY HAD PARTED FOR THE SECOND TIME I LET THEM GO THEIR SEVERAL WAYS AND STROLLED ON THROUGH THE TOWN
AND LET ME WISH YOU JOY ALSO DEAR FRIEND HE ADDED LOOKING SADLY AT THE EARL AND SPEAKING IN THE SAME HOLLOW TONES THAT HAD STARTLED US SO MUCH THANK YOU THE OLD MAN SAID SIMPLY AND HEARTILY
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE AN OUTLANDISH WATCH AS I ENTERED THE LITTLE TOWN I CAME UPON TWO OF THE FISHERMEN'S WIVES INTERCHANGING THAT LAST WORD WHICH NEVER WAS THE LAST AND IT OCCURRED TO ME AS AN EXPERIMENT WITH THE MAGIC WATCH
BUT THE REAL USEFULNESS OF THIS MAGIC POWER I THOUGHT WOULD BE TO UNDO SOME HARM SOME PAINFUL EVENT SOME ACCIDENT I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF TESTING THIS PROPERTY ALSO OF THE MAGIC WATCH FOR EVEN AS THE THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
AND ERIC HAS GONE TO THE HOTEL TO PACK HIS THINGS TO START FOR LONDON BY THE EARLY TRAIN THEN THE TELEGRAM HAS COME I SAID DID YOU NOT HEAR OH I HAD FORGOTTEN IT CAME IN AFTER YOU LEFT THE STATION YES IT'S ALL RIGHT ERIC HAS GOT HIS COMMISSION
AND THIS NEW OFFER I ADMIT IS VERY VERY KINDLY MEANT STILL TO AVAIL MYSELF OF IT WOULD NOT BE QUITE CONVENIENT YOU'LL SEE IN A MOMENT WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN CONVENIENT AND INCONVENIENT
I WAS PASSING A PRETTY LITTLE VILLA WHICH STOOD RATHER BACK FROM THE ROAD IN ITS OWN GROUNDS WITH BRIGHT FLOWER BEDS IN FRONT CREEPERS WANDERING OVER THE WALLS AND HANGING IN FESTOONS ABOUT THE BOW WINDOWS AN EASY CHAIR FORGOTTEN ON THE LAWN WITH A NEWSPAPER LYING NEAR IT
TO WAIT TILL THE LITTLE SCENE WAS OVER AND THEN TO ENCORE IT WELL GOOD NIGHT AND YE
HOW GOOD HOW GREAT POOR PETER CRIED YET I MUST SELL MY SUNDAY WIG THE SCARF PIN THAT HAS BEEN MY PRIDE MY GRAND PIANO AND MY PIG FULL SOON HIS PROPERTY TOOK WINGS AND DAILY AS EACH TREASURE WENT
A MAN MAY SURELY CLAIM HIS DUES BUT WHEN THERE'S MONEY TO BE LENT A MAN MUST BE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE SUCH TIMES AS ARE CONVENIENT IT CHANCED ONE DAY AS PETER SAT GNAWING A CRUST HIS USUAL MEAL
AND AFTER HAVING FOUND THAT HIS PULSE WAS STILL BEATING THAT THE WOUNDED MAN HAD NO VERY DEEP WOUND ON HIS BREAST AND THAT THE BLOOD ON THE CORNERS OF HIS LIPS PROCEEDED FROM HIS NOSTRILS HE HAD HIM PLACED FLAT ON THE BED WITHOUT A PILLOW
HE IS WOUNDED SAID JEAN VALJEAN
LET US IMPRESS IT UPON THE READER AFTER THE BISHOP
A FULL PAIL WAS REDDENED IN AN INSTANT THE PORTER CANDLE IN HAND LIGHTED THEM THE DOCTOR SEEMED TO BE PONDERING SADLY FROM TIME TO TIME HE MADE A NEGATIVE SIGN WITH HIS HEAD
AND TOOK FORM IN THE EXCLAMATION
CHAPTER TWELVE THE GRANDFATHER BASQUE AND THE PORTER HAD CARRIED MARIUS INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
MOTIONLESS ON THE SOFA UPON WHICH HE HAD BEEN PLACED ON HIS ARRIVAL THE DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN SENT FOR HAD HASTENED THITHER
TWILIGHT HAD DESCENDED NIGHT WAS DRAWING ON THE GREAT DELIVERER THE FRIEND OF ALL THOSE WHO NEED A MANTLE OF DARKNESS THAT THEY MAY ESCAPE FROM AN ANGUISH THE SKY PRESENTED ITSELF IN ALL DIRECTIONS LIKE AN ENORMOUS CALM
NO LONGER LOOKED LIKE HIMSELF HE DID NOT UNFOLD HIS ARMS HE MADE SURE OF HIS BLUDGEON IN HIS FIST BY AN IMPERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT AND SAID IN A CURT CALM VOICE WHO ARE YOU I WHO
A SPY OF THE FIRST QUALITY WHO HAD OBSERVED EVERYTHING LISTENED TO EVERYTHING AND TAKEN IN EVERYTHING EVEN WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS TO DIE
I DO NOT RECOLLECT HIS NAME
AT THE SAME TIME DRAWING HIS CERTIFICATE BOOK FROM HIS POCKET HE BEGGED THE INSPECTOR TO HAVE THE GOODNESS TO WRITE HIM A BIT OF AN ATTESTATION JAVERT THRUST ASIDE THE BOOK WHICH THE COACHMAN HELD OUT TO HIM AND SAID HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT
THE PORTER DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND EITHER JAVERT'S WORDS OR JEAN VALJEAN'S SIGN JAVERT CONTINUED
PEACE BROODS OVER THE DREAMER LIKE NIGHT AND BENEATH THE TWILIGHT WHICH BEAMS AND IN IMITATION OF THE SKY WHICH IS ILLUMINATED THE SOUL BECOMES STUDDED WITH STARS
IN A TONE BEFITTING THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE DISORDER THERE WAS SERIOUS THE ARMS HAD BEEN SLASHED WITH SABRE CUTS NOT A SINGLE SCAR DISFIGURED HIS FACE BUT HIS HEAD WAS FAIRLY COVERED WITH CUTS WHAT WOULD BE THE RESULT OF THESE WOUNDS ON THE HEAD
IT WAS THAT EXQUISITE AND UNDECIDED HOUR WHICH SAYS NEITHER YES NOR NO NIGHT WAS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED TO RENDER IT POSSIBLE TO LOSE ONESELF AT A LITTLE DISTANCE AND YET THERE WAS SUFFICIENT DAYLIGHT TO PERMIT OF RECOGNITION AT CLOSE QUARTERS
AND HAD NOT RESISTED ANY OTHER MAN THAN HIMSELF IN LIKE SITUATION WOULD PERHAPS HAVE HAD SOME VAGUE THOUGHTS CONNECTED WITH THE ROPE WHICH THENARDIER HAD GIVEN HIM AND OF THE BARS OF THE FIRST CELL THAT HE SHOULD ENTER BUT
OR TO THE POST OF THE ARCHIVES BOTH OF WHICH ARE CLOSE AT HAND THEY ENTERED THE STREET IT WAS DESERTED AS USUAL JAVERT FOLLOWED JEAN VALJEAN
THE GRANDFATHER TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT AS POWERFULLY AS OSSIFIED LIMBS CAN TREMBLE HIS EYES WHOSE CORNEAE WERE YELLOW ON ACCOUNT OF HIS GREAT AGE WERE VEILED IN A SORT OF VITREOUS GLITTER
A SIGN OF SAVAGE REVERY AT LENGTH HE RELEASED JEAN VALJEAN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF STIFFLY UP WITHOUT BENDING GRASPED HIS BLUDGEON AGAIN FIRMLY AND AS THOUGH IN A DREAM HE MURMURED RATHER THAN UTTERED THIS QUESTION WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
JAVERT DID NOT APPEAR TO HEAR HIM HE KEPT HIS EYES RIVETED ON JEAN VALJEAN HIS CHIN BEING CONTRACTED THRUST HIS LIPS UPWARDS
JEAN VALJEAN LOOKED AT JAVERT THIS MODE OF PROCEDURE WAS BUT LITTLE IN ACCORD WITH JAVERT'S HABITS HOWEVER HE COULD NOT BE GREATLY SURPRISED THAT JAVERT SHOULD NOW HAVE A SORT OF HAUGHTY CONFIDENCE IN HIM
HE GAVE A VIOLENT PEAL THE GATE OPENED A LITTLE WAY AND JAVERT GAVE IT A PUSH THE PORTER HALF MADE HIS APPEARANCE YAWNING VAGUELY AWAKE AND WITH A CANDLE IN HIS HAND EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE WAS ASLEEP
THIS GOOD OLD QUARTER TERRIFIED AT THE REVOLUTION TAKES REFUGE IN SLUMBER AS CHILDREN WHEN THEY HEAR THE BUGABOO COMING HIDE THEIR HEADS HASTILY UNDER THEIR COVERLET IN THE MEANTIME JEAN VALJEAN AND THE COACHMAN
A FEW STARS DAINTILY PIERCING THE PALE BLUE OF THE ZENITH AND VISIBLE TO REVERY ALONE FORMED IMPERCEPTIBLE LITTLE SPLENDORS AMID THE IMMENSITY EVENING WAS UNFOLDING OVER THE HEAD OF JEAN VALJEAN ALL THE SWEETNESS OF THE INFINITE
THE CONFIDENCE OF THE CAT WHICH GRANTS THE MOUSE LIBERTY TO THE LENGTH OF ITS CLAWS SEEING THAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO SURRENDER HIMSELF AND TO MAKE AN END OF IT HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR ENTERED THE HOUSE
IT COMES TO SEVEN HOURS AND A QUARTER
AS THOUGH REPLYING TO SOME QUESTION WHICH HE HAD INWARDLY ADDRESSED TO HIMSELF A BAD SIGN FOR THE SICK MAN ARE THESE MYSTERIOUS DIALOGUES OF THE DOCTOR WITH HIMSELF
PEOPLE GO TO BED BETIMES IN THE MARAIS
FOR SEVERAL SECONDS JEAN VALJEAN WAS IRRESISTIBLY OVERCOME BY THAT AUGUST AND CARESSING SERENITY SUCH MOMENTS OF OBLIVION DO COME TO MEN SUFFERING REFRAINS FROM HARASSING THE UNHAPPY WRETCH EVERYTHING IS ECLIPSED IN THE THOUGHTS
REPEATED JAVERT AND HE ADDED THERE WILL BE A FUNERAL HERE TO MORROW
CAST SOME LIGHT ON THE STAIRS AND THUS EFFECTED SOME ECONOMY IN ILLUMINATION JEAN VALJEAN EITHER FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE AIR OR MECHANICALLY THRUST HIS HEAD OUT OF THIS WINDOW HE LEANED OUT OVER THE STREET
JAVERT DREW FOUR NAPOLEONS FROM HIS POCKET AND DISMISSED THE CARRIAGE JEAN VALJEAN FANCIED THAT IT WAS JAVERT'S INTENTION TO CONDUCT HIM ON FOOT TO THE POST
AND LIGHTLY TOUCHING HIS STILL CLOSED EYES WITH HIS FINGER A DOOR OPENED AT THE END OF THE DRAWING ROOM AND A LONG PALLID FIGURE MADE ITS APPEARANCE THIS WAS THE GRANDFATHER THE REVOLT HAD FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS DEEPLY AGITATED
SEEMED TO HAVE BUT ONE THOUGHT HE RESUMED
THE MAN SPIED UPON HAS A SCENT WHICH NEVER DECEIVES HIM IT WAS NECESSARY TO FLING A BONE TO THAT SLEUTH HOUND AN ASSASSIN
A GLACIAL SILENCE REIGNED IN THE CARRIAGE MARIUS MOTIONLESS WITH HIS BODY RESTING IN THE CORNER AND HIS HEAD DROOPING ON HIS BREAST HIS ARMS HANGING HIS LEGS STIFF SEEMED TO BE AWAITING ONLY A COFFIN JEAN VALJEAN SEEMED MADE OF SHADOW
AND DEPOSITED ON AN OLD SOFA
WHENCE THEY EMERGED ON OCCASION IN VARIABLE QUANTITIES IN THE STREET UPROAR REVOLT CARNIVAL
DISPOSE OF ME AS YOU SEE FIT BUT FIRST HELP ME TO CARRY HIM HOME
THE PORTER DID NOT STIR
IT IS SHORT AND THE LANTERN LIGHTED IT FROM END TO END JEAN VALJEAN WAS OVERWHELMED WITH AMAZEMENT
JEAN VALJEAN KNOCKED THE DOOR OPENED
JEAN VALJEAN SLIPPED HIS HAND UNDER THE LATTER'S CLOTHES WHICH WERE BROADLY RENT FELT HIS BREAST AND ASSURED HIMSELF THAT HIS HEART WAS STILL BEATING IT WAS EVEN BEATING A LITTLE LESS FEEBLY AS THOUGH THE MOVEMENT OF THE CARRIAGE HAD BROUGHT ABOUT A CERTAIN FRESH ACCESS OF LIFE
TO THE BARRICADE EJACULATED THE PORTER
ON PERCEIVING THAT THEY WERE UNDRESSING MARIUS WITHDREW SHE SET HERSELF TO TELLING HER BEADS IN HER OWN CHAMBER THE TRUNK HAD NOT SUFFERED ANY INTERNAL INJURY A BULLET DEADENED BY THE POCKET BOOK
AH THE RASCAL
THIS MAN WAS AT THE BARRICADE
AS IT IS ALWAYS INDISPENSABLE THAT INTERNAL ERUPTIONS SHOULD COME TO THE LIGHT THE SEQUENCE OF WORDS RETURNED
THE EFFECT OF BEING DEAD HE ALLOWED MARIUS TO SLIDE DOWN UPON THE SHORE
HIS WHOLE FACE ASSUMED IN AN INSTANT THE EARTHY ANGLES OF A SKULL HIS ARMS FELL PENDENT AS THOUGH A SPRING HAD BROKEN AND HIS AMAZEMENT WAS BETRAYED BY THE OUTSPREADING OF THE FINGERS OF HIS TWO AGED HANDS WHICH QUIVERED ALL OVER
CALLED TO THE PORTER WHO WAS IN BED AND WHO HAD PULLED THE CORD FROM HIS COUCH IT IS I AND ASCENDED THE STAIRS ON ARRIVING AT THE FIRST FLOOR HE PAUSED ALL SORROWFUL ROADS HAVE THEIR STATIONS
BASQUE WOKE NICOLETTE NICOLETTE
HIS PREOCCUPATION MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN VERY PROFOUND FOR HIM NOT TO INSIST ON THIS ALARMING RESCUE THROUGH THE SEWER AND FOR HIM NOT TO EVEN NOTICE JEAN VALJEAN'S SILENCE AFTER HIS QUESTION JEAN VALJEAN ON HIS SIDE
JAVERT POSSESSED IN HIS EYE THE FELINE PHOSPHORESCENCE OF NIGHT BIRDS HE DECIPHERED THE FEW LINES WRITTEN BY MARIUS AND MUTTERED GILLENORMAND
THE WINDOW ON THE LANDING PLACE WHICH WAS A SASH WINDOW WAS OPEN AS IN MANY ANCIENT HOUSES THE STAIRCASE GOT ITS LIGHT FROM WITHOUT AND HAD A VIEW ON THE STREET THE STREET LANTERN SITUATED DIRECTLY OPPOSITE
AROUSED THE ATTENTION OF THE POLICE THERE HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THENARDIER AND HAD FOLLOWED HIM THE READER KNOWS THE REST THUS IT WILL BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT GRATING
DREW FROM HIS POCKET A HANDKERCHIEF WHICH HE MOISTENED IN THE WATER
SHE DID NOT GO SO FAR AS I TOLD YOU SO WHICH IS CUSTOMARY ON THIS SORT OF OCCASION AT THE PHYSICIAN'S ORDERS A CAMP BED HAD BEEN PREPARED BESIDE THE SOFA THE DOCTOR EXAMINED MARIUS
JEAN VALJEAN JAVERT THRUST HIS BLUDGEON BETWEEN HIS TEETH BENT HIS KNEES INCLINED HIS BODY LAID HIS TWO POWERFUL HANDS ON THE SHOULDERS OF JEAN VALJEAN WHICH WERE CLAMPED WITHIN THEM AS IN A COUPLE OF VICES
A MOMENT LATER THE CARRIAGE WHICH HAD DESCENDED BY THE INCLINED PLANE OF THE WATERING PLACE WAS ON THE SHORE MARIUS WAS LAID UPON THE BACK SEAT
THESE TWO ENCOUNTERS THIS FALLING ONE AFTER THE OTHER
HAD TAKEN MARIUS OUT OF THE CARRIAGE JEAN VALJEAN SUPPORTING HIM UNDER THE ARMPITS AND THE COACHMAN UNDER THE KNEES
AND HE HAD BEEN IN A FEVER ALL DAY LONG IN THE EVENING HE HAD GONE TO BED VERY EARLY RECOMMENDING THAT EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE SHOULD BE WELL BARRED AND HE HAD FALLEN INTO A DOZE THROUGH SHEER FATIGUE OLD MEN SLEEP LIGHTLY
TO GIVE HER POSSIBLY SOME OTHER USEFUL INFORMATION TO TAKE IF HE COULD CERTAIN FINAL MEASURES AS FOR HIMSELF SO FAR AS HE WAS PERSONALLY CONCERNED ALL WAS OVER
WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO JEAN VALJEAN
BUT HIS HALF OPEN MOUTH STILL BREATHED JEAN VALJEAN WAS ON THE POINT OF DIPPING HIS HAND IN THE RIVER ONCE MORE WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE EXPERIENCED AN INDESCRIBABLE EMBARRASSMENT SUCH AS A PERSON FEELS WHEN THERE IS SOME ONE BEHIND HIM
AND ON THE MATTRESS THAT YOUNG MAN BLEEDING WHITE WITH A WAXEN WHITENESS WITH CLOSED EYES AND GAPING MOUTH AND PALLID LIPS STRIPPED TO THE WAIST SLASHED ALL OVER WITH CRIMSON WOUNDS MOTIONLESS AND BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED UP
RETURN OF THE SON WHO WAS PRODIGAL OF HIS LIFE
THAT THE UTRECHT VELVET OF HIS CARRIAGE WAS ALL SPOTTED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE ASSASSINATED MAN AND WITH MIRE FROM THE ASSASSIN THAT IS THE WAY HE UNDERSTOOD IT HE ADDED THAT AN INDEMNITY WAS DUE HIM
INSPECTOR JAVERT SAID JEAN GRANT ME YET ANOTHER FAVOR WHAT IS IT DEMANDED JAVERT ROUGHLY LET ME GO HOME FOR ONE INSTANT THEN YOU SHALL DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE WITH ME
JEAN VALJEAN COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM CONTEMPLATING THAT VAST CLEAR SHADOW WHICH RESTED OVER HIM THOUGHTFULLY HE BATHED IN THE SEA OF ECSTASY AND PRAYER IN THE MAJESTIC SILENCE OF THE ETERNAL HEAVENS THEN HE BENT DOWN SWIFTLY TO MARIUS
HIS KNEES FORMED AN ANGLE IN FRONT ALLOWING THROUGH THE OPENING IN HIS DRESSING GOWN A VIEW OF HIS POOR BARE LEGS ALL BRISTLING WITH WHITE HAIRS AND HE MURMURED
MOREOVER THE WOUNDED MAN HAD BEEN EXHAUSTED BY HEMORRHAGE FROM THE WAIST DOWN THE BARRICADE HAD PROTECTED THE LOWER PART OF THE BODY FROM INJURY BASQUE AND NICOLETTE
A MAN OF LOFTY STATURE ENVELOPED IN A LONG COAT WITH FOLDED ARMS AND BEARING IN HIS RIGHT FIST A BLUDGEON OF WHICH THE LEADEN HEAD WAS VISIBLE STOOD A FEW PACES IN THE REAR OF THE SPOT WHERE JEAN VALJEAN WAS CROUCHING OVER MARIUS
SIR SAID BASQUE MONSIEUR HAS JUST BEEN BROUGHT BACK
HAD TURNED ASIDE AND MADE THE TOUR OF HIS RIBS WITH A HIDEOUS LACERATION WHICH WAS OF NO GREAT DEPTH AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT DANGEROUS THE LONG UNDERGROUND JOURNEY HAD COMPLETED THE DISLOCATION OF THE BROKEN COLLAR BONE
WITH HIS HEAD ON THE SAME LEVEL AS HIS BODY AND EVEN A TRIFLE LOWER AND WITH HIS BUST BARE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE RESPIRATION
PULLED OUT HIS POCKET BOOK OPENED IT AT THE PAGE WHICH MARIUS HAD PENCILLED AND HELD IT OUT TO JAVERT THERE WAS STILL SUFFICIENT LIGHT TO ADMIT OF READING BESIDES THIS
THEN HE EXCLAIMED COACHMAN THE READER WILL REMEMBER THAT THE HACKNEY COACH WAS WAITING IN CASE OF NEED
SCRUTINIZED HIM AND RECOGNIZED HIM THEIR FACES ALMOST TOUCHED JAVERT'S LOOK WAS TERRIBLE JEAN VALJEAN REMAINED INERT BENEATH JAVERT'S GRASP LIKE A LION SUBMITTING TO THE CLAWS OF A LYNX
THE CARRIAGE HALTED THE WAY BEING TOO NARROW TO ADMIT OF THE ENTRANCE OF VEHICLES JAVERT AND JEAN VALJEAN ALIGHTED THE COACHMAN HUMBLY REPRESENTED TO MONSIEUR L'INSPECTEUR
JAVERT WAS THE FIRST TO ALIGHT HE MADE SURE WITH ONE GLANCE OF THE NUMBER ON THE CARRIAGE GATE AND RAISING THE HEAVY KNOCKER OF BEATEN IRON EMBELLISHED IN THE OLD STYLE WITH A MALE GOAT AND A SATYR CONFRONTING EACH OTHER
CHANCE HAD UNITED AND SEEMED TO BE BRINGING FACE TO FACE THE THREE FORMS OF TRAGIC IMMOBILITY THE CORPSE THE SPECTRE
HAVING BEHIND HIM THE STEP OF JAVERT WHO WAS FOLLOWING HIM THE PORTER WATCHED THEM TAKE THEIR DEPARTURE AS HE HAD WATCHED THEIR ARRIVAL IN TERRIFIED SOMNOLENCE THEY ENTERED THE CARRIAGE ONCE MORE AND THE COACHMAN MOUNTED HIS BOX
THE DOOR SLAMMED AND THE CARRIAGE DROVE RAPIDLY AWAY ASCENDING THE QUAYS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BASTILLE THEY QUITTED THE QUAYS AND ENTERED THE STREETS THE COACHMAN A BLACK FORM ON HIS BOX WHIPPED UP HIS THIN HORSES
WOULD THEY STOP SHORT AT THE HAIRY CUTICLE OR WOULD THEY ATTACK THE BRAIN AS YET THIS COULD NOT BE DECIDED A GRAVE SYMPTOM WAS THAT THEY HAD CAUSED A SWOON AND THAT PEOPLE DO NOT ALWAYS RECOVER FROM SUCH SWOONS
JAVERT REMAINED SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS WITH HIS CHIN DRAWN BACK INTO THE COLLAR OF HIS GREAT COAT THEN HE LOWERED THE GLASS AND FRONT DRIVER SAID HE
JAVERT'S FACE CONTRACTED AS WAS ALWAYS THE CASE WHEN ANY ONE SEEMED TO THINK HIM CAPABLE OF MAKING A CONCESSION NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT SAY NO AGAIN HE BENT OVER
THE RIVER FLOWED TO HIS FEET WITH THE SOUND OF A KISS
IN AFFRIGHT WRINGING HER HANDS AND INCAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING BUT SAYING HEAVENS IS IT POSSIBLE AT TIMES SHE ADDED
SAID JAVERT JEAN VALJEAN REPLIED NO NOT YET SO YOU HAVE BROUGHT HIM THITHER FROM THE BARRICADE REMARKED JAVERT
GO UP STAIRS HE ADDED WITH A STRANGE EXPRESSION AND AS THOUGH HE WERE EXERTING AN EFFORT IN SPEAKING IN THIS MANNER
THEY DID NOT OPEN THEIR LIPS AGAIN DURING THE WHOLE SPACE OF THEIR RIDE WHAT DID JEAN VALJEAN WANT TO FINISH WHAT HE HAD BEGUN TO WARN COSETTE TO TELL HER WHERE MARIUS WAS
WITH HIS HEAD BENT A LITTLE FORWARD AND QUIVERING HIS BODY WRAPPED IN A WHITE DRESSING GOWN WHICH WAS STRAIGHT AND AS DESTITUTE OF FOLDS AS A WINDING SHEET AND HE HAD THE AIR OF A PHANTOM WHO IS GAZING INTO A TOMB HE SAW THE BED
THE MIASMAS DARKNESS HORROR LAY BEHIND HIM THE PURE HEALTHFUL LIVING JOYOUS AIR THAT WAS EASY TO BREATHE INUNDATED HIM EVERYWHERE AROUND HIM REIGNED SILENCE BUT THAT CHARMING SILENCE
AND WHILE BASQUE WENT IN SEARCH OF A PHYSICIAN AND WHILE NICOLETTE OPENED THE LINEN PRESSES JEAN VALJEAN FELT JAVERT TOUCH HIM ON THE SHOULDER HE UNDERSTOOD AND DESCENDED THE STAIRS
HE STILL ABSTAINED FROM ADDRESSING JEAN VALJEAN AS THOU JEAN VALJEAN REPLIED AND THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE APPEARED TO ROUSE JAVERT
NICOLETTE SEWED THEM BASQUE ROLLED THEM AS LINT WAS LACKING THE DOCTOR FOR THE TIME BEING ARRESTED THE BLEEDING WITH LAYERS OF WADDING BESIDE THE BED THREE CANDLES BURNED ON A TABLE WHERE THE CASE OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS LAY SPREAD OUT
HAD BETAKEN HIMSELF TO THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE HAD RENDERED A VERBAL ACCOUNT TO THE PREFECT IN PERSON IN A BRIEF AUDIENCE HAD THEN IMMEDIATELY GONE ON DUTY AGAIN WHICH IMPLIED THE NOTE THE READER WILL RECOLLECT WHICH HAD BEEN CAPTURED ON HIS PERSON
REPAID JAVERT FOR HIS WAITING WHICH ALWAYS FLATTERS A SPY EARNED THIRTY FRANCS AND COUNTED WITH CERTAINTY SO FAR AS HE HIMSELF WAS CONCERNED ON ESCAPING WITH THE AID OF THIS DIVERSION
SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO SLIP THENARDIER BY PUTTING JEAN VALJEAN OUTSIDE IN HIS STEAD PROVIDED A PREY FOR THE POLICE FORCED THEM TO RELINQUISH HIS SCENT MADE THEM FORGET HIM IN A BIGGER ADVENTURE
WITH THE AID OF THE DARKNESS IT SEEMED A SORT OF APPARITION AN ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN ALARMED BECAUSE OF THE TWILIGHT A THOUGHTFUL MAN ON ACCOUNT OF THE BLUDGEON JEAN VALJEAN RECOGNIZED JAVERT
WHOM HE DOES NOT SEE WE HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO THIS IMPRESSION WITH WHICH EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR HE TURNED ROUND SOME ONE WAS IN FACT BEHIND HIM AS THERE HAD BEEN A SHORT WHILE BEFORE
AS THOUGH THE SENTIMENT OF DUTY HAD RETURNED TO HIM AND DIPPING UP WATER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND HE GENTLY SPRINKLED A FEW DROPS ON THE LATTER'S FACE
THE USUAL INCIDENTS OF THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY WERE CATEGORICALLY CLASSED WHICH IS THE BEGINNING OF FORESIGHT AND SURVEILLANCE AND EACH CONTINGENCY HAD ITS OWN COMPARTMENT ALL POSSIBLE FACTS WERE ARRANGED IN DRAWERS AS IT WERE
MOREOVER I HAVE REGARDED MYSELF AS YOUR PRISONER EVER SINCE THIS MORNING I DID NOT GIVE YOU MY ADDRESS WITH ANY INTENTION OF ESCAPING FROM YOU TAKE ME ONLY GRANT ME ONE FAVOR
AS FOR THE GRANDFATHER THEY LET HIM SLEEP ON THINKING THAT HE WOULD HEAR ABOUT THE MATTER EARLY ENOUGH IN ANY CASE MARIUS WAS CARRIED UP TO THE FIRST FLOOR WITHOUT ANY ONE IN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE HOUSE BEING AWARE OF THE FACT
THE NOISE HAD AWAKENED HIM SURPRISED AT THE RIFT OF LIGHT WHICH HE SAW UNDER HIS DOOR HE HAD RISEN FROM HIS BED AND HAD GROPED HIS WAY THITHER HE STOOD ASTONISHED ON THE THRESHOLD ONE HAND ON THE HANDLE OF THE HALF OPEN DOOR
AND IN THAT VEHICLE FULL OF NIGHT WHOSE INTERIOR EVERY TIME THAT IT PASSED IN FRONT OF A STREET LANTERN APPEARED TO BE TURNED LIVIDLY WAN AS BY AN INTERMITTENT FLASH OF LIGHTNING
A PROFOUND HESITATION IN THE PRESENCE OF ANY VIOLENCE EVEN WHEN DIRECTED AGAINST HIMSELF SUICIDE THAT MYSTERIOUS ACT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE UNKNOWN WHICH MAY CONTAIN IN A MEASURE THE DEATH OF THE SOUL
THAT BY SUCH OUTSIDE HATRED OF THEIR IMPIETY THOU MIGHTEST BE BELIEVED A LOVER OF THY FATHER AND MIGHTEST THEREBY GET THEE POWER ENOUGH TO DO MISCHIEF WITH THE GREATEST IMPUNITY WHICH DESIGN THY ACTIONS INDEED DEMONSTRATE IT IS TRUE THOU TOOKEST THY BRETHREN OFF
AS BY HIS GROSS AND IMPUDENT AND WICKED CONTRIVANCES AND BY HIS ILL WILL TO HIS FATHER AND HIS BRETHREN WHILE HE HAD FILLED THEIR HOUSE WITH DISTURBANCE AND CAUSED THEM TO MURDER ONE ANOTHER AND WAS NEITHER FAIR IN HIS HATRED NOR KIND IN HIS FRIENDSHIP BUT JUST SO FAR AS SERVED HIS OWN TURN
BUT THAT THY TORTURES MAY BE ESTEEMED THE DISCOVERERS OF TRUTH WILT NOT THOU O VARUS DELIVER THE KING FROM THE INJURIES OF HIS KINDRED
FOUND THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO SAY BESIDES HIS APPEAL TO GOD AND SAW THAT THERE WAS NO END OF THAT HE BID THEM BRING THE POTION BEFORE THE COURT THAT HE MIGHT SEE WHAT VIRTUE STILL REMAINED IN IT
AND NOW THE KING'S CAPTAIN UPON HEARING WHAT THE UNDERTAKING WAS AND SUPPOSING IT WAS A THING OF A HIGHER NATURE THAN IT PROVED TO BE CAME UP THITHER HAVING A GREAT BAND OF SOLDIERS WITH HIM SUCH AS WAS SUFFICIENT TO PUT A STOP TO THE MULTITUDE OF THOSE WHO PULLED DOWN WHAT WAS DEDICATED TO GOD
OR FROM THE TESTIMONIES HE PRINCIPALLY AND LARGELY CRIED UP THE KING'S VIRTUES WHICH HE HAD EXHIBITED IN THE MAINTENANCE AND EDUCATION OF HIS SONS WHILE HE NEVER COULD GAIN ANY ADVANTAGE THEREBY BUT STILL FELL FROM ONE MISFORTUNE TO ANOTHER
HE ALSO DISTRIBUTED AMONG HIS SONS AND THEIR SONS HIS MONEY HIS REVENUES AND HIS LANDS
BUT OTHERS DESIRED HIM TO RELEASE THOSE THAT WERE PUT INTO PRISON BY HEROD WHO WERE MANY AND HAD BEEN PUT THERE AT SEVERAL TIMES OTHERS OF THEM REQUIRED THAT HE WOULD TAKE AWAY THOSE TAXES WHICH HAD BEEN SEVERELY LAID UPON WHAT WAS PUBLICLY SOLD AND BOUGHT
AND RETURNED THEM THANKS THAT THEY DID NOT REMEMBER THE INJURIES HIS FATHER HAD DONE THEM TO HIS DISADVANTAGE
BUT SENT AS INSTRUCTED BEFOREHAND WHAT ANSWERS THEY WERE TO MAKE TO THE QUESTIONS PUT TO THEM THEY ALSO CARRIED THE EPISTLES WITH THEM BUT HEROD NOW FELL INTO A DISTEMPER AND MADE HIS WILL AND BEQUEATHED HIS KINGDOM TO ANTIPAS HIS YOUNGEST SON
BUT UPON THE LAMENTABLE CRIES OF HIS DOMESTICS HE REVIVED AND HAVING NO LONGER THE LEAST HOPES OF RECOVERING
AND RAISED HIMSELF UPON HIS ELBOW AND SENT FOR SOME OF HIS GUARDS AND COMMANDED THEM TO KILL ANTIPATER WITHOUT TINY FURTHER DELAY AND TO DO IT PRESENTLY AND TO BURY HIM IN AN IGNOBLE MANNER AT HYRCANIA CHAPTER EIGHT
AND WITHOUT SUCH MOURNING AS MEN USUALLY EXPECT AT A KING'S DEATH
AND INVITEDST THEM TO ASSIST THEE AND GUARD THEE AND DIDST HEDGE THYSELF IN ON ALL SIDES BY THE ARTIFICES OF BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AGAINST AN OLD MAN
HE HAD ALSO CONVULSIONS IN ALL PARTS OF HIS BODY WHICH INCREASED HIS STRENGTH TO AN INSUFFERABLE DEGREE IT WAS SAID BY THOSE WHO PRETENDED TO DIVINE AND WHO WERE ENDUED WITH WISDOM TO FORETELL SUCH THINGS
SO THERE WAS PRESENTLY AN ACCLAMATION MADE TO ARCHELAUS AS KING AND THE SOLDIERS CAME BY BANDS AND THEIR COMMANDERS WITH THEM AND PROMISED THE SAME GOOD WILL TO HIM AND READINESS TO SERVE HIM WHICH THEY HAD EXHIBITED TO HEROD
TWO OF THE MOST ELOQUENT MEN AMONG THE JEWS AND THE MOST CELEBRATED INTERPRETERS OF THE JEWISH LAWS AND MEN WELL BELOVED BY THE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR EDUCATION OF THEIR YOUTH FOR ALL THOSE THAT WERE STUDIOUS OF VIRTUE FREQUENTED THEIR LECTURES EVERY DAY
AND THE FIRST THING THEY DID WAS THEY READ HEROD'S LETTER WRITTEN TO THE SOLDIERY THANKING THEM FOR THEIR FIDELITY AND GOOD WILL TO HIM AND EXHORTING THEM TO AFFORD HIS SON ARCHELAUS WHOM HE HAD APPOINTED FOR THEIR KING LIKE FIDELITY AND GOOD WILL
FOR SO MANY DAYS ARE APPOINTED FOR IT BY THE LAW OF OUR FATHERS AND WHEN HE HAD GIVEN A TREAT TO THE MULTITUDE AND LEFT OFF HIS MOTORING HE WENT UP INTO THE TEMPLE HE HAD ALSO ACCLAMATIONS AND PRAISES GIVEN HIM
AND FROM BRINGING HIS VERY LIFE INTO DANGER IN ORDER TO GAIN HIS KINGDOM AFTER AN IMPIOUS MANNER BY TAKING AWAY HIS LIFE BEFORE THE COURSE OF NATURE THEIR FATHER'S WISHES OR JUSTICE REQUIRED THAT THAT KINGDOM SHOULD COME TO THEM
NOW THERE WERE A GREAT NUMBER WHO FOR A LONG TIME BEFOREHAND HAD SEEN ALL THIS AND ESPECIALLY SUCH AS WERE NATURALLY DISPOSED TO JUDGE OF MATTERS BY THE RULES OF VIRTUE BECAUSE THEY WERE USED TO DETERMINE ABOUT AFFAIRS WITHOUT PASSION BUT HAD BEEN RESTRAINED FROM MAKING ANY OPEN COMPLAINTS BEFORE
BUT THAT HE SHOULD ABSTAIN AT PRESENT FROM THE NAME OF KING AND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE HONOR OF THAT DIGNITY IF CAESAR SHOULD CONFIRM AND SETTLE THAT TESTAMENT WHICH HIS FATHER HAD MADE AND THAT IT WAS ON THIS ACCOUNT THAT WHEN THE ARMY WOULD HAVE PUT THE DIADEM ON HIM AT JERICHO
WHO YET WAS NO MORE TO BE IMPOSED UPON THAN GOD HIMSELF OF WHOSE OPINIONS HIS LETTERS SENT HITHER ARE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND THAT IT WAS NOT REASONABLE TO PREFER THE CALUMNIES OF SUCH AS PROPOSED TO RAISE DISTURBANCES BEFORE THOSE LETTERS THE GREATEST PART OF WHICH CALUMNIES HAD BEEN RAISED DURING HIS ABSENCE
OF ANTIPATER WHO ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT ONLY HAD GREAT BENEFITS BESTOWED ON HIM BY HIS FATHER ENOUGH TO TAME HIS REASON YET COULD NOT BE MORE TAMED THAN THE MOST ENVENOMED SERPENTS WHEREAS EVEN THOSE CREATURES ADMIT OF SOME MITIGATION AND WILL NOT BITE THEIR BENEFACTORS
AND THAT HE WONDERED WHAT HOPES COULD ELEVATE ANTIPATER TO SUCH A PASS AS TO BE HARDY ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT SUCH THINGS
THAT HE HAD ALSO ADORNED IT WITH VERY VALUABLE DONATIONS ON WHICH ACCOUNT HE HOPED THAT HE HAD LEFT HIMSELF A MEMORIAL AND PROCURED HIMSELF A REPUTATION AFTER HIS DEATH HE THEN CRIED OUT THAT THESE MEN HAD NOT ABSTAINED FROM AFFRONTING HIM EVEN IN HIS LIFETIME BUT THAT IN THE VERY DAY TIME
AND THUS THEY ALL SAID AND THEIR COURAGE WAS STILL EQUAL TO THEIR PROFESSION AND EQUAL TO THAT WITH WHICH THEY READILY SET ABOUT THIS UNDERTAKING
AND THEY WERE PUT INTO THE FOLLOWING ORDER FIRST OF ALL WENT HIS GUARDS THEN THE BAND OF THRACIANS AND AFTER THEM THE GERMANS AND NEXT THE BAND OF GALATIANS EVERY ONE IN THEIR HABILIMENTS OF WAR
WHEREUPON A WOEFUL LAMENTATION ECHOED THROUGH THE PALACE AND A GREAT TUMULT WAS MADE AS IF THE KING WERE DEAD UPON WHICH ANTIPATER WHO VERILY BELIEVED HIS FATHER WAS DECEASED
AND WHEN HE HAD NOT ONE WORD TO SAY HE ASKED HIM SINCE HE WAS EVERY WAY CAUGHT IN HIS VILLAINY THAT HE WOULD MAKE NO FURTHER DELAY BUT DISCOVER HIS ASSOCIATES IN THESE HIS WICKED DESIGNS
WHOM THOU IN WORDS PRETENDEDST TO PRESERVE NOR WAST THOU CONTENT TO BE WICKED THYSELF BUT THOU FILLEDST THY MOTHER'S HEAD WITH THY DEVICES AND RAISED DISTURBANCES AMONG THY BRETHREN AND HADST THE BOLDNESS TO CALL THY FATHER A WILD BEAST
OUT OF SUSPICION OF ANY DANGER THEY WERE IN BUT THEY SPAKE WHAT THEY KNEW BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT SUCH ACTIONS VERY WICKED AND THAT ANTIPATER DESERVED THE GREATEST PUNISHMENT AND INDEED NOT SO MUCH FOR HEROD'S SAFETY AS ON ACCOUNT OF THE MAN'S OWN WICKEDNESS
HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT OF THAT HONOR WHICH IS USUALLY SO MUCH DESIRED
WHILE YET HE IS HIMSELF ALONE READY TO CARRY OFF THE KINGDOM IMMEDIATELY AND APPEARS TO BE THE MOST BLOODY BUTCHER TO HIM OF THEM ALL FOR THOU ART SENSIBLE THAT PARRICIDE IS A GENERAL INJURY BOTH TO NATURE AND TO COMMON LIFE
ESCAPE THE DANGER HE WAS IN SO HE KEPT HIM BOUND AS BEFORE AND SENT MORE AMBASSADORS AND LETTERS TO ROME TO ACCUSE HIS SON
BUT BY THOSE COMMANDS OF HIS WHICH SAVORED OF NO HUMANITY SINCE HE TOOK CARE WHEN HE WAS DEPARTING OUT OF THIS LIFE THAT THE WHOLE NATION SHOULD BE PUT INTO MOURNING AND INDEED MADE DESOLATE OF THEIR DEAREST KINDRED
AFTER WHICH PTOLEMY WHO HAD THE KING'S SEAL INTRUSTED TO HIM READ THE KING'S TESTAMENT WHICH WAS TO BE OF FORCE NO OTHERWISE THAN AS IT SHOULD STAND WHEN CAESAR HAD INSPECTED IT
FOR THERE BY HIS OWN COMMAND HE WAS TO BE BURIED
FOR THAT HE HAD MADE PROVISION FOR EVERY THING THAT WAS FIT TO BE FORESEEN BEFOREHAND AS TO GIVING HIM HIS WISEST ADVICE AND WHENEVER THERE WAS OCCASION FOR THE LABOR OF HIS OWN HANDS HE HAD NOT GRUDGED ANY SUCH PAINS FOR HIM
NOW THE LAW FORBIDS THOSE THAT PROPOSE TO LIVE ACCORDING TO IT
WHO THOUGHT IT AN IGNOMINIOUS THING TO RETIRE UPON HIS APPROACH AND LED THEM TO THE KING
BUT WHEN ONCE THEY ARE FOUND OUT AND ARE IN DANGER OF UNDERGOING THE PUNISHMENT DUE TO THEIR CRIMES THEY ENDEAVOR TO OVERTHROW ALL THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM BY APPEALING TO GOD WHICH WAS THE VERY THING WHICH ANTIPATER NOW DID FOR WHEREAS HE HAD DONE EVERYTHING AS IF THERE WERE NO GOD IN THE WORLD
AND IN THE SIGHT OF THE MULTITUDE THEY HAD ABUSED HIM TO THAT DEGREE AS TO FALL UPON WHAT HE HAD DEDICATED AND IN THAT WAY OF ABUSE HAD PULLED IT DOWN TO THE GROUND THEY PRETENDED INDEED THAT THEY DID IT TO AFFRONT HIM BUT IF ANY ONE CONSIDER THE THING TRULY
IF HE HAD PREPARED ANY THING WHEREBY IT MIGHT APPEAR THAT HE WAS NOT GUILTY OF THE CRIMES HE WAS ACCUSED OF FOR THAT
UPON WHICH HEROD LAID HIS SON IN BONDS BUT WHAT WERE VARUS'S DISCOURSES TO HEROD WAS NOT KNOWN TO THE GENERALITY AND UPON WHAT WORDS IT WAS THAT HE WENT AWAY
AND BY NOBODY ELSE AND HAD DONE WHAT WAS DONE BY HIS APPROBATION
HE HAD A DIADEM UPON HIS HEAD AND ABOVE IT A CROWN OF GOLD HE ALSO HAD A SCEPTER IN HIS RIGHT HAND ABOUT THE BIER WERE HIS SONS AND HIS NUMEROUS RELATIONS NEXT TO THESE WAS THE SOLDIERY DISTINGUISHED ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL COUNTRIES AND DENOMINATIONS
YES SAID THEY WHAT WAS CONTRIVED WE CONTRIVED AND WHAT HATH BEEN PERFORMED WE PERFORMED IT AND THAT WITH SUCH A VIRTUOUS COURAGE AS BECOMES MEN FOR WE HAVE GIVEN OUR ASSISTANCE TO THOSE THINGS WHICH WERE DEDICATED TO THE MAJESTY OF GOD AND WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED BY HEARING THE LAW
BECAUSE THOU DIDST CONVICT THEFT OF THEIR WICKED DESIGNS BUT THOU DIDST NOT YIELD UP TO JUSTICE THOSE WHO WERE THEIR PARTNERS AND THEREBY DIDST MAKE IT EVIDENT TO ALL MEN THAT THOU MADEST A COVENANT WITH THEM AGAINST THY FATHER WHEN THOU CHOSEST TO BE THE ACCUSER OF THY BRETHREN
BUT WHEN HEROD HAD BOUND HIS SON HE SENT LETTERS TO ROME TO CAESAR ABOUT HIM AND SUCH MESSENGERS WITHAL AS SHOULD BY WORD OF MOUTH INFORM CAESAR OF ANTIPATER'S WICKEDNESS
AN AQUEOUS AND TRANSPARENT LIQUOR ALSO HAD SETTLED ITSELF ABOUT HIS FEET AND A LIKE MATTER AFFLICTED HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS BELLY NAY FURTHER
SO DID HE KNOW THAT HIS FATHER WAS IN LIKE MANNER DESIROUS ALSO TO HAVE HIM FOUND ENTIRELY INNOCENT BUT ANTIPATER FELL DOWN ON HIS FACE AND APPEALED TO GOD AND TO ALL MEN FOR TESTIMONIALS OF HIS INNOCENCY DESIRING THAT GOD WOULD DECLARE BY SOME EVIDENT SIGNALS THAT HE HAD NOT LAID ANY PLOT AGAINST HIS FATHER
AND BECAUSE HE COULD NOT OFFICIATE HIMSELF ON THAT ACCOUNT JOSEPH THE SON OF ELLEMUS HIS KINSMAN ASSISTED HIM IN THAT SACRED OFFICE BUT HEROD DEPRIVED THIS MATTHIAS OF THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD AND BURNT THE OTHER MATTHIAS WHO HAD RAISED THE SEDITION WITH HIS COMPANIONS ALIVE AND THAT VERY NIGHT
BUT DISCOVERED NOBODY ELSE HEREUPON HEROD WAS IN SUCH GREAT GRIEF THAT HE WAS READY TO SEND HIS SON TO ROME TO CAESAR THERE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THESE HIS WICKED CONTRIVANCES BUT HE SOON BECAME AFRAID LEST HE MIGHT THERE BY THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS FRIENDS
AND IT APPEARED PLAINLY THAT HEROD HIMSELF WAS AFFECTED IN HIS OWN MIND ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT WILLING IT SHOULD BE TAKEN NOTICE OF THEN DID NICOLAUS BEGIN TO PROSECUTE WHAT THE KING HAD BEGUN AND THAT WITH GREAT BITTERNESS AND SUMMED UP ALL THE EVIDENCE WHICH AROSE FROM THE TORTURES
AND TO CERTAIN OTHERS FIVE MILLIONS WHEN HE HAD DONE THESE THINGS HE DIED THE FIFTH DAY AFTER HE HAD CAUSED ANTIPATER TO BE SLAIN HAVING REIGNED SINCE HE HAD PROCURED ANTIGONUS TO BE SLAIN THIRTY FOUR YEARS
AND THAT NOTHING AFFORDED ANY WEIGHT TO HIS ACCUSERS AT PRESENT BUT HIS ABSENCE
HIS ENTRAILS WERE ALSO EX ULCERATED
AND WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT AND ONE THAT WAS CONDEMNED TO DIE HAD DRANK IT BY VARUS'S COMMAND HE DIED PRESENTLY THEN VARUS GOT UP AND DEPARTED OUT OF THE COURT AND WENT AWAY THE DAY FOLLOWING TO ANTIOCH WHERE HIS USUAL RESIDENCE WAS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE PALACE OF THE SYRIANS
AND INFORMED HIM THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH HIS COMMAND SHE HAD BOTH HERSELF WRITTEN TO HEROD AS IF SALOME HAD LAID A SUDDEN PLOT ENTIRELY AGAINST HIM AND HAD HERSELF SENT A COPY OF AN EPISTLE AS COMING FROM SALOME TO HER LADY NOW ACME WAS A JEW BY BIRTH AND A SERVANT TO JULIA CAESAR'S WIFE
SO HEROD ORDERED HIM TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE MIDST AND THEN LAMENTED HIMSELF ABOUT HIS CHILDREN FROM WHOM HE HAD SUFFERED SUCH GREAT MISFORTUNES AND BECAUSE ANTIPATER FELL UPON HIM IN HIS OLD AGE
AND BESIDES THESE SOME SLAVES OF ANTIPATER'S MOTHER WHO WERE TAKEN UP A LITTLE BEFORE ANTIPATER'S COMING AND BROUGHT WITH THEM A WRITTEN LETTER THE SUM OF WHICH WAS THIS THAT HE SHOULD NOT COME BACK BECAUSE ALL WAS COME TO HIS FATHER'S KNOWLEDGE
HE GOT CLEAR OF THEM ALL AND CONTINUED HIS LIFE TILL A VERY OLD AGE BUT THEN AS TO THE AFFAIRS OF HIS FAMILY AND CHILDREN IN WHICH INDEED ACCORDING TO HIS OWN OPINION HE WAS ALSO VERY FORTUNATE BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO CONQUER HIS ENEMIES
WAS THE PENALTY OF SUCH AS SHOULD DESPISE THE EPISTLES THAT WERE SENT TO CALL THEM AND NOW THE KING WAS IN A WILD RAGE AGAINST THEM ALL THE INNOCENT AS WELL AS THOSE THAT HAD AFFORDED GROUND FOR ACCUSATIONS
AND WHEN THEY WERE COME HE MADE THEM ASSEMBLE IN THE THEATER AND BECAUSE HE COULD NOT HIMSELF STAND HE LAY UPON A COUCH AND ENUMERATED THE MANY LABORS THAT HE HAD LONG ENDURED ON THEIR ACCOUNT AND HIS BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE AND WHAT A VAST CHARGE THAT WAS TO HIM
WHEN HE GAVE ORDER THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY FAMILY SHOULD BE SLAIN ALTHOUGH THEY HAD DONE NOTHING THAT WAS UNJUST OR THAT WAS AGAINST HIM NOR WERE THEY ACCUSED OF ANY OTHER CRIMES WHILE IT IS USUAL FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ANY REGARD TO VIRTUE TO LAY ASIDE THEIR HATRED AT SUCH A TIME
ALTHOUGH BY HIS ACCEPTANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT HE SHOULD NOT WANT THE ABILITY OF REWARDING THEIR KINDNESS TO HIM AND THAT IT SHOULD BE HIS ENDEAVOR AS TO ALL THINGS WHEREIN THEY WERE CONCERNED TO PROVE IN EVERY RESPECT BETTER THAN HIS FATHER
AND THIS OUT OF THAT HATRED TO ARCHCLAUS AND PHILIP WHICH THE CALUMNIES OF ANTIPATER HAD RAISED AGAINST THEM HE ALSO BEQUEATHED A THOUSAND TALENTS TO CAESAR AND FIVE HUNDRED TO JULIA CAESAR'S WIFE TO CAESAR'S CHILDREN AND FRIENDS AND FREED MEN
AS DESIROUS TO GAIN TO THYSELF ALONE THIS ADVANTAGE OF LAYING PLOTS TO KILL THY FATHER
THE PORTERS INDEED RECEIVED HIM IN BUT EXCLUDED HIS FRIENDS AND NOW HE WAS IN GREAT DISORDER AND PRESENTLY UNDERSTOOD THE CONDITION HE WAS IN WHILE UPON HIS GOING TO SALUTE HIS FATHER HE WAS REPULSED BY HIM WHO CALLED HIM A MURDERER OF HIS BRETHREN AND A PLOTTER OF DESTRUCTION AGAINST HIMSELF
THESE MEN WHEN THEY FOUND THAT THE KING'S DISTEMPER WAS INCURABLE EXCITED THE YOUNG MEN THAT THEY WOULD PULL DOWN ALL THOSE WORKS WHICH THE KING HAD ERECTED CONTRARY TO THE LAW OF THEIR FATHERS AND THEREBY OBTAIN THE REWARDS WHICH THE LAW WILL CONFER ON THEM FOR SUCH ACTIONS OF PIETY
GREW BOLD IN HIS DISCOURSE AS HOPING TO BE IMMEDIATELY AND ENTIRELY RELEASED FROM HIS BONDS AND TO TAKE THE KINGDOM INTO HIS HANDS WITHOUT ANY MORE ADO SO HE DISCOURSED WITH THE JAILER ABOUT LETTING HIM GO AND IN THAT CASE PROMISED HIM GREAT THINGS BOTH NOW AND HEREAFTER
BEATING HER BREAST AND BIDDING HIM KILL HER IF HE COULD PRODUCE ANY CREDIBLE TESTIMONY THAT SHE HAD ACTED IN THAT MANNER HEROD ALSO SENT FOR HIS SON AND ASKED HIM ABOUT THIS MATTER AND BID HIM CONTRADICT IF HE COULD AND NOT SUPPRESS ANY THING HE HAD TO SAY FOR HIMSELF
HE GUESSED THAT THE LETTER MIGHT BE WITHIN THAT DOUBLING WHICH ACCORDINGLY PROVED TO BE TRUE SO THEY TOOK OUT THE LETTER AND ITS CONTENTS WERE THESE ACME TO ANTIPATER I HAVE WRITTEN SUCH A LETTER TO THY FATHER AS THOU DESIREDST ME
DISMISSED THOSE THAT WERE SHUT UP IN THE HIPPODROME AND TOLD THEM THAT THE KING ORDERED THEM TO GO AWAY TO THEIR OWN LANDS AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN AFFAIRS WHICH WAS ESTEEMED BY THE NATION A GREAT BENEFIT AND NOW THE KING'S DEATH WAS MADE PUBLIC
NOW SOME OF HIS FRIENDS ADVISED HIM THAT HE SHOULD TARRY A WHILE SOME WHERE IN EXPECTATION OF FURTHER INFORMATION BUT OTHERS ADVISED HIM TO SAIL HOME WITHOUT DELAY FOR THAT IF HE WERE ONCE COME THITHER HE WOULD SOON PUT AN END TO ALL ACCUSATIONS
AND WHEN HE SAW THE SAD EXAMPLE OF HIS BRETHREN BEFORE HIM AND WAS BOTH THE INFORMER AND THE ACCUSER AGAINST THEM AT A TIME WHEN THEY MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED
I WISH THEE GOOD SUCCESS IN THY AFFAIR THESE WERE THE CONTENTS OF THIS LETTER BUT THE KING MADE INQUIRY ABOUT THE OTHER LETTER ALSO FOR IT DID NOT APPEAR
SO HE CALLED FOR AN APPLE AND A KNIFE FOR IT WAS HIS CUSTOM FORMERLY TO PARE THE APPLE HIMSELF AND SOON AFTERWARDS TO CUT IT AND EAT IT WHEN HE HAD GOT THE KNIFE HE LOOKED ABOUT AND HAD A MIND TO STAB HIMSELF WITH IT
AND IT OUGHT NOT TO BE WONDERED AT IF WE ESTEEM THOSE LAWS WHICH MOSES HAD SUGGESTED TO HIM AND WERE TAUGHT HIM BY GOD AND WHICH HE WROTE AND LEFT BEHIND HIM MORE WORTHY OF OBSERVATION THAN THY COMMANDS ACCORDINGLY
I SHALL DIE IN A LITTLE TIME SO GREAT ARE MY PAINS WHICH DEATH OUGHT TO BE CHEERFULLY BORNE AND TO BE WELCOMED BY ALL MEN BUT WHAT PRINCIPALLY TROUBLES ME IS THIS THAT I SHALL DIE WITHOUT BEING LAMENTED
BY SO MUCH DID THEY MORE HIGHLY COMMEND HIM AND MADE APPLICATION TO HIM FOR THE GRANT OF WHAT THEY DESIRED SOME MADE A CLAMOR THAT HE WOULD EASE THEM OF SOME OF THEIR ANNUAL PAYMENTS
FOR HEROD HAD CAUSED SUCH THINGS TO BE MADE WHICH WERE CONTRARY TO THE LAW OF WHICH HE WAS ACCUSED BY JUDAS AND MATTHIAS FOR THE KING HAD ERECTED OVER THE GREAT GATE OF THE TEMPLE A LARGE GOLDEN EAGLE OF GREAT VALUE AND HAD DEDICATED IT TO THE TEMPLE
HE COMMANDED THAT ALL THE PRINCIPAL MEN OF THE ENTIRE JEWISH NATION WHERESOEVER THEY LIVED SHOULD BE CALLED TO HIM ACCORDINGLY THEY WERE A GREAT NUMBER THAT CAME BECAUSE THE WHOLE NATION WAS CALLED AND ALL MEN HEARD OF THIS CALL AND DEATH
NOR WAS THERE NOW ANY THING TO HINDER THEM FROM ENTERTAINING HIM ON THE CONTRARY WITH BITTER CURSES
SO HE FELL UPON THEM UNEXPECTEDLY AND AS THEY WERE UPON THIS BOLD ATTEMPT IN A FOOLISH PRESUMPTION RATHER THAN A CAUTIOUS CIRCUMSPECTION AS IS USUAL WITH THE MULTITUDE
AS IF THAT WERE THE ONLY THING NOW IN QUESTION
AND THAT AS TO ANTIPATER HIMSELF CAESAR LEFT IT TO HEROD TO ACT AS BECAME A FATHER AND A KING AND EITHER TO BANISH HIM OR TO TAKE AWAY HIS LIFE WHICH HE PLEASED WHEN HEROD HEARD THIS HE WAS SOME WHAT BETTER OUT OF THE PLEASURE HE HAD FROM THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTERS
AND WHILE THEY WERE IN DISORDER AND INCAUTIOUS OF WHAT WAS FOR THEIR ADVANTAGE SO HE CAUGHT NO FEWER THAN FORTY OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD THE COURAGE TO STAY BEHIND WHEN THE REST RAN AWAY TOGETHER WITH THE AUTHORS OF THIS BOLD ATTEMPT
AND WHATSOEVER SHE HAD PRATTLED LIKE A WOMAN AS ALSO ABOUT THE PREDICTIONS AND THE SACRIFICES RELATING TO THE KING AND WHATSOEVER ANTIPATER HAD DONE LASCIVIOUSLY IN HIS CUPS AND HIS AMOURS AMONG PHERORAS'S WOMEN THE EXAMINATION UPON TORTURE
AND WHATSOEVER CONCERNED THE TESTIMONIES OF THE WITNESSES WHICH WERE MANY AND OF VARIOUS KINDS SOME PREPARED BEFOREHAND AND OTHERS WERE SUDDEN ANSWERS WHICH FURTHER DECLARED AND CONFIRMED THE FOREGOING EVIDENCE
AND HERE THOU APPEAREST AFTER THE TORTURES OF FREE MEN OF DOMESTICS OF MEN AND WOMEN WHICH HAVE BEEN EXAMINED ON THY ACCOUNT AND AFTER THE INFORMATIONS OF THY FELLOW CONSPIRATORS AS MAKING HASTE TO CONTRADICT THE TRUTH
THAT THOU DESIREST TO BE PUT TO THE TORTURE THYSELF WHILE THOU ALLEGEST THAT THE TORTURES OF THOSE ALREADY EXAMINED THEREBY
WHILE THOU HADST THYSELF A MIND MORE CRUEL THAN ANY SERPENT
AND WAS ELEVATED AT THE DEATH OF ACME AND AT THE POWER THAT WAS GIVEN HIM OVER HIS SON BUT AS HIS PAINS WERE BECOME VERY GREAT HE WAS NOW READY TO FAINT FOR WANT OF SOMEWHAT TO EAT
AND THAT THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD THAT A PERSON WHO HAD THE ONE HALF OF THAT AUTHORITY WITHOUT ANY DANGER AND WITH A GOOD CHARACTER SHOULD HUNT AFTER THE WHOLE WITH INFAMY AND DANGER AND THIS WHEN IT WAS DOUBTFUL WHETHER HE COULD OBTAIN IT OR NOT
SINCE THAT COMMON CALAMITY OF DYING CANNOT BE AVOIDED BY OUR LIVING SO AS TO ESCAPE ANY SUCH DANGERS THAT THEREFORE IT IS A RIGHT THING FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN LOVE WITH A VIRTUOUS CONDUCT TO WAIT FOR THAT FATAL HOUR BY SUCH BEHAVIOR AS MAY CARRY THEM OUT OF THE WORLD WITH PRAISE AND HONOR
DID THESE MEN EXCITE THE YOUNG MEN TO THIS ACTION
HE ALSO OBJECTED TO HIM THE CASE OF HIS BRETHREN WHOM HE HAD ACCUSED AND IF THEY WERE GUILTY HE HAD IMITATED THEIR EXAMPLE AND IF NOT HE HAD BROUGHT HIM GROUNDLESS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIS NEAR RELATIONS FOR THAT HE HAD BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THOSE THINGS BY HIM
THIS WAS AN ADDITION TO THE WISE MEN'S PERSUASIONS SO IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY GOT UPON THE PLACE THEY PULLED DOWN THE EAGLE AND CUT IT INTO PIECES WITH AXES WHILE A GREAT NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WERE IN THE TEMPLE
AND BEHIND THESE MARCHED THE WHOLE ARMY IN THE SAME MANNER AS THEY USED TO GO OUT TO WAR AND AS THEY USED TO BE PUT IN ARRAY BY THEIR MUSTER MASTERS AND CENTURIONS THESE WERE FOLLOWED BY FIVE HUNDRED OF HIS DOMESTICS CARRYING SPICES
AND LEST WHILE HE LIVED AT ROME HE SHOULD LAY PLOTS FOR THE KINGDOM AND MOREOVER DO SOMEWHAT AGAINST HIMSELF
HIS PRIVY MEMBER WAS PUTREFIED AND PRODUCED WORMS AND WHEN HE SAT UPRIGHT HE HAD A DIFFICULTY OF BREATHING WHICH WAS VERY LOATHSOME ON ACCOUNT OF THE STENCH OF HIS BREATH AND THE QUICKNESS OF ITS RETURNS
ANTIPATER'S NAVIGATION FROM ROME TO HIS FATHER
THE INFORMER AS TO WHAT WICKED ACTIONS THEY HAD DONE AND THE SEARCHER OUT OF THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM AND THE AUTHOR OF THE PUNISHMENT THEY UNDERWENT UPON THEIR DETECTION NOR DO WE SAY THIS AS ACCUSING THEE FOR BEING SO ZEALOUS IN THY ANGER AGAINST THEM
FOR THOSE MEN WHO WERE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH ANTIPATER'S PRACTICES BUT HAD CONCEALED THEM OUT OF FEAR WHEN THEY SAW THAT HE WAS EXPOSED TO THE ACCUSATIONS OF THE FORMER WITNESSES AND THAT HIS GREAT GOOD FORTUNE WHICH HAD SUPPORTED HIM HITHERTO
TOLD ALL THEY KNEW OF HIM AND HIS RUIN WAS NOW HASTENED
THIS BEING THE USUAL METHOD OF ALL MEN DESTITUTE OF VIRTUE THAT WHEN THEY SET ABOUT ANY WICKED UNDERTAKINGS THEY FALL TO WORK ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN INCLINATIONS AS IF THEY BELIEVED THAT GOD WAS UNCONCERNED IN HUMAN AFFAIRS
WHEN HE WAS ON ALL SIDES DISTRESSED BY JUSTICE AND WHEN HE HAD NO OTHER ADVANTAGE TO EXPECT FROM ANY LEGAL PROOFS BY WHICH HE MIGHT DISPROVE THE ACCUSATIONS LAID AGAINST HIM HE IMPUDENTLY ABUSED THE MAJESTY OF GOD AND ASCRIBED IT TO HIS POWER THAT HE HAD BEEN PRESERVED HITHERTO
WERE ALSO FIT TO DRINK WHICH WATER RUNS INTO THE LAKE CALLED ASPHALTIRIS AND WHEN THE PHYSICIANS ONCE THOUGHT FIT TO HAVE HIM BATHED IN A VESSEL FULL OF OIL IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS JUST DYING
BUT FOR CERTAIN THOU DIDST NOT MEASURE THESE THINGS ACCORDING TO THY FATHER'S VARIOUS DISPOSITION BUT ACCORDING TO THY OWN THOUGHTS AND INCLINATIONS AND WAS DESIROUS TO TAKE THE PART THAT REMAINED AWAY FROM THY TOO INDULGENT FATHER AND SOUGHTEST TO DESTROY HIM WITH THY DEEDS
EITHER IN HIS ILLUSTRIOUS DIGNITY OR IN POWER AND AUTHORITY
WHICH HEROD HAD BUILT AT VAST EXPENSES IN HONOR OF CAESAR AND CALLED SEBASTUS AND NOW WAS ANTIPATER EVIDENTLY IN A MISERABLE CONDITION WHILE NOBODY CAME TO HIM NOR SALUTED HIM AS THEY DID AT HIS GOING AWAY WITH GOOD WISHES OF JOYFUL ACCLAMATIONS
CONCERNING THE DISEASE THAT HEROD FELL INTO AND THE SEDITION WHICH THE JEWS RAISED THEREUPON
BEING SENT TO SUCCEED SATURNINUS AS PRESIDENT OF SYRIA AND WAS COME AS AN ASSESSOR TO HEROD WHO HAD DESIRED HIS ADVICE IN HIS PRESENT AFFAIRS AND AS THEY WERE SITTING TOGETHER ANTIPATER CAME UPON THEM WITHOUT KNOWING ANY THING OF THE MATTER SO HE CAME INTO THE PALACE CLOTHED IN PURPLE
AT THE SAME TIME ALSO HE MADE SOME LITTLE COMPLAINT ABOUT HIS MOTHER BUT PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LAY THOSE COMPLAINTS ASIDE WHEN HE SHOULD RETURN HE WITHAL EXPRESSED HIS ENTIRE AFFECTION FOR HIM AS FEARING LEST HE SHOULD HAVE SOME SUSPICION OF HIM AND DEFER HIS JOURNEY TO HIM
UPON ANTIPATER'S WRITING TO HIM THAT HAVING DONE ALL THAT HE WAS TO DO AND THIS IN THE MANNER HE WAS TO DO IT HE WOULD SUDDENLY COME TO HIM CONCEALED HIS ANGER AGAINST HIM AND WROTE BACK TO HIM AND BID HIM NOT DELAY HIS JOURNEY LEST ANY HARM SHOULD BEFALL HIMSELF IN HIS ABSENCE
WHILE THEY GREATLY PITIED ANTIPATER WHO BY WEEPING AND PUTTING ON A COUNTENANCE SUITABLE TO HIS SAD CASE MADE THEM COMMISERATE THE SAME
HE ALSO RECKONED UP WHAT MAINTENANCE AND WHAT EDUCATION HE HAD GIVEN THEM AND WHAT SEASONABLE SUPPLIES OF WEALTH HE HAD AFFORDED THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN DESIRES NONE OF WHICH FAVORS HAD HINDERED THEM FROM CONTRIVING AGAINST HIM
AND WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS AFFAIRS
BUT ABOVE THE CONSIDERATION OF WHAT WAS RIGHT YET WAS HE FAVORED BY FORTUNE AS MUCH AS ANY MAN EVER WAS FOR FROM A PRIVATE MAN HE BECAME A KING AND THOUGH HE WERE ENCOMPASSED WITH TEN THOUSAND DANGERS
AND HE ALSO GAVE A GREAT DEAL TO THEIR COMMANDERS AND TO HIS FRIENDS AND CAME AGAIN TO JERICHO WHERE HE GREW SO CHOLERIC THAT IT BROUGHT HIM TO DO ALL THINGS LIKE A MADMAN AND THOUGH HE WERE NEAR HIS DEATH HE CONTRIVED THE FOLLOWING WICKED DESIGNS
NAY WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE PUNISHMENT INFLICTED UPON THEM WHEN IT APPEARED EVIDENTLY THAT THEY WERE GUILTY OF A WICKED ATTEMPT AGAINST THEIR FATHER AND THAT EVEN THE CONTENTIONS THERE WERE IN THE KING'S FAMILY WERE INDICATIONS THAT HE HAD EVER MANAGED AFFAIRS OUT OF THE SINCEREST AFFECTION TO HIS FATHER AND AS TO WHAT HE HAD DONE AT ROME
AND THIS BY GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON HIM FOR HIS SINS FOR A FIRE GLOWED IN HIM SLOWLY WHICH DID NOT SO MUCH APPEAR TO THE TOUCH OUTWARDLY AS IT AUGMENTED HIS PAINS INWARDLY
WHICH WHEN THEY WERE READ THEIR PURPORT WAS THIS THAT ACME WAS SLAIN BY CAESAR OUT OF HIS INDIGNATION AT WHAT HAND SHE HAD IN ANTIPATER'S WICKED PRACTICES
AND AS HE DESPAIRED OF RECOVERING FOR HE WAS ABOUT THE SEVENTIETH YEAR OF HIS AGE HE GREW FIERCE AND INDULGED THE BITTEREST ANGER UPON ALL OCCASIONS THE CAUSE WHEREOF WAS THIS THAT HE THOUGHT HIMSELF DESPISED AND THAT THE NATION WAS PLEASED WITH HIS MISFORTUNES
HE DEPRIVED MATTHIAS OF THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD AS IN PART AN OCCASION OF THIS ACTION AND MADE JOAZAR WHO WAS MATTHIAS'S WIFE'S BROTHER HIGH PRIEST IN HIS STEAD
AND THAT THIS WILL ALLEVIATE DEATH TO A GREAT DEGREE THUS TO COME AT IT BY THE PERFORMANCE OF BRAVE ACTIONS WHICH BRING US INTO DANGER OF IT AND AT THE SAME TIME TO LEAVE THAT REPUTATION BEHIND THEM TO THEIR CHILDREN AND TO ALL THEIR RELATIONS WHETHER THEY BE MEN OR WOMEN
AND THAT CAESAR WAS THE ONLY REFUGE HE HAD LEFT TO PREVENT BOTH HIS AND HER DELIVERY INTO HIS FATHER'S HANDS THEN DID ANTIPATER FALL DOWN AT HIS FATHER'S FEET AND BESOUGHT HIM NOT TO PREJUDGE HIS CAUSE
IF ONE WERE ABLE TO RECALL ONE'S CHILDHOOD AT THE AGE OF ABOUT TWELVE OR THIRTEEN WHEN THE ARTISTIC IMPULSE SO OFTEN GOES INTO ABEYANCE AND ONE BEGINS TO THINK IN A TROUBLED MONSTROUS WAY ABOUT GOD AND HELL
TWO WEEKS LATER I WENT AGAIN THIS TIME TO HEAR
THERE WERE LONG INTERVALS OF FRIENDLY SILENCE I DON'T IN THE LEAST WANT TO GO ON TALKING ABOUT MYSELF SAID SIR RICHMOND ABRUPTLY LET IT REST THEN SAID THE DOCTOR GENEROUSLY TO DAY AMONG THESE ANCIENT MEMORIES HAS TAKEN ME OUT OF MYSELF WONDERFULLY
THE TWO GENTLEMEN LINGERED AT THE TURNSTILE FOR A MOMENT OR SO TO WATCH HIS PROCEEDINGS MODERN CHILD SAID SIR RICHMOND OLD STONES ARE JUST OLD STONES TO HIM BUT MOTOR CARS ARE GODS YOU CAN HARDLY EXPECT HIM TO UNDERSTAND AT HIS AGE
IT LOOKS SIR RICHMOND SAID AS THOUGH SOME OLD GIANTESS HAD LEFT A DISCARDED SET OF TEETH ON THE HILLSIDE FAR MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN STONEHENGE ITSELF WERE THE BARROWS THAT CAPPED THE NEIGHBOURING CRESTS THE SACRED STONES WERE FENCED ABOUT
BUT SHE INSISTS ON DATES
SAID SIR RICHMOND WELL
THOUGH THEY WRESTLED MIGHTILY WITH THE PROBLEM NEITHER SIR RICHMOND NOR THE DOCTOR COULD THROW A GLEAM OF LIGHT UPON THE RIDDLE WHY THE DITCH WAS INSIDE AND NOT OUTSIDE THE GREAT WALL AND WHAT WAS OUR MIND LIKE IN THOSE DAYS SAID SIR RICHMOND
A GREAT BOY WHO IS ALMOST SIX
AND THE TRAFFIC TO WHICH THE GREEN ROADS TESTIFY THE DOCTOR HAD NOT REALIZED BEFORE THE BOLDNESS AND LIVELINESS OF HIS COMPANION'S MIND SIR RICHMOND INSISTED THAT THE CLIMATE MUST HAVE BEEN MOISTER AND MILDER IN THOSE DAYS HE COVERED ALL THE DOWNLANDS WITH WOODS
TO LOOK AT MYSELF AS A CASE NOW I CAN EVEN SEE MYSELF AS A REMOTE CASE THAT I NEEDN'T BOTHER ABOUT FURTHER SO FAR AS THAT GOES I THINK WE HAVE DONE ALL THAT THERE IS TO BE DONE I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT QUITE YET SAID THE DOCTOR
FOR EXAMPLE SAID THE DOCTOR OF COURSE WE DON'T DOUBT YOUR WORD BUT WHEN A MAN MAKES A STATEMENT BASED UPON PERSONAL OBSERVATION IT IS PROFITABLE TO ASK HIM WHAT HIS PRECISE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN MERELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADDING TO OUR OWN KNOWLEDGE
I DON'T SEE THE PLACE SAID THE YOUNG LADY ON THE STONE I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW THEY DID IT UP NOT ONE BIT
IT'S JUST THE BONES OF A PLACE THEY HUNG THINGS ROUND IT THEY DRAPED IT BUT WHAT THINGS ASKED SIR RICHMOND OH THEY HAD THINGS ALL RIGHT SKINS PERHAPS MATS OF RUSHES BAST CLOTH
AROUND THIS LONELY PLACE RISE THE DOWNS NOW BARE SHEEP PASTURES IN BROAD UNDULATIONS WITH A WART LIKE BARROW HERE AND THERE AND FROM IT RADIATE CREEPING UP TO GAIN AND HOLD THE CRESTS OF THE HILLS THE ABANDONED TRACKWAYS OF THAT FORGOTTEN WORLD
WHAT BECOMES OF THEM DEMANDED THE DOCTOR
I NOTICED LAST NIGHT BEFORE GOING TO BED THAT MY MEDICINE CHEST WAS ABOUT RUN OUT THERE'S NOTHING BUT ONE QUININE PILL AND A SODA MINT DROP IN IT AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE MUSIC CURE I DON'T THINK I'LL HAVE IT FILLED AGAIN I PREFER WAGNER TO SQUILLS
OR IF THEY DO THEY HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHICH IS JUST AS BAD I DON'T BELIEVE THEY KNOW
HE SAID THAT THIS EXPEDITION HAS ALREADY BEEN A WONDERFULLY GOOD THING FOR ME THESE CONFESSIONS HAVE MADE ME LOOK INTO ALL SORTS OF THINGS SQUARELY BUT I'M NOT USED TO TALKING ABOUT MYSELF OR EVEN THINKING DIRECTLY ABOUT MYSELF
SQUILLS PAREGORIC AND OTHER NASTY TASTING THINGS THEY HAVE NOW THIS ALONE WILL SERVE TO POPULARIZE SICKNESS AND INSTEAD OF BEING DRIVEN OUT OF BUSINESS THEIR TRADE WILL PICK UP AND THE DOCTOR AND THE DOCTOR'S GIG AND ALL THE APPURTENANCES OF HIS PROFESSION
AT THE FIFTH SIR RICHMOND WAS SUDDENLY CONCLUSIVE IT'S NO USE HE SAID I CAN'T FIDDLE ABOUT ANY MORE WITH MY MOTIVES TO DAY AN AWKWARD SILENCE FOLLOWED ON REFLECTION SIR RICHMOND SEEMED TO REALIZE THAT THIS SENTENCE NEEDED SOME APOLOGY I ADMIT
AND TOOK TWO ROOMS FOR THE NIGHT THAT THEY MIGHT THE BETTER GET THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE ANCIENT PLACE WONDERFUL INDEED IT IS A VAST CIRCUMVALLATION THAT WAS ALREADY TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD BEFORE THE DAWN OF BRITISH HISTORY
I COULD NOT GET TWO HOURS OF CONSECUTIVE SLEEP AND THE EFFECT OF MY SUFFERINGS WAS TO MAKE ME NERVOUS AND IRRITABLE SUDDENLY SOMEBODY PRESENTED ME WITH A COUPLE OF TICKETS FOR A PERFORMANCE OF PARSIFAL AND I WENT IT BEGAN AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
AFTER THREE HOURS OR SO OF THE COMMITTEE ONE CONCENTRATES INTO ONE LITTLE INFLAMED MOMENT OF PERSONALITY THERE IS NO PAST ANY LONGER THERE IS NO FUTURE THERE IS ONLY THE RANKLING DISPUTE FOR ALL THOSE THREE HOURS PERHAPS
SO FAR AS I KNOW THEY HAD NO BEASTS OF BURTHEN BUT SUPPOSE ONE DAY SOMEONE WERE TO FIND A POTSHERD HERE FROM EARLY KNOSSOS OR A FRAGMENT OF GLASS FROM PEPI'S EGYPT THE PLACE HAD STIRRED UP HIS IMAGINATION
SAID THE FATHER OF THE FAMILY IN THE REPROVING TONE OF ONE WHO NEVER ALLOWS A NOVEL IDEA INSIDE HIS DOORS IF HE CAN PREVENT IT WELL SAID THE YOUNG LADY I GUESS THERE WAS SOME SORT OF SHOW HERE ANYHOW
HE WRESTLED WITH HIS IGNORANCE AS IF HE THOUGHT THAT BY TALKING HE MIGHT PRESENTLY WORRY OUT SOME PICTURE OF THIS FORGOTTEN WORLD WITHOUT METALS WITHOUT BEASTS OF BURTHEN WITHOUT LETTERS WITHOUT ANY SCULPTURE THAT HAS LEFT A TRACE AND YET WITH A SENSE OF ASTRONOMICAL FACT CLEAR ENOUGH TO RAISE THE GREAT GNOMON OF SILBURY
NOTHING IN IT WHY DOCTOR THERE'S MORE IN IT THAT'S IN SIGHT TO DAY THAT IS PROMISING AND SUGGESTIVE OF GREAT THINGS IN THE FUTURE
I AM SURPRISED THAT DOCTOR CAPSULE HAS NEITHER HEARD NOR THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD PROVE TO BE A PLEASANT AND PROFITABLE FIELD FOR SPECULATION
THERE'LL BE A HOT TIME IN THE OLD TOWN TO NIGHT WILL BECOME AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY FOR A SUDDEN CHILL PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM SLEEPLESSNESS CAN DOSE THEMSELVES BACK TO NORMAL CONDITIONS AGAIN WITH WAGNER THE WAY I DID TCHAIKOWSKI TO BE WELL TSHAKEN BEFORE TAKEN
I DON'T KNOW SAID THE DOCTOR SO LITTLE IS KNOWN VERY LIKE CHILDREN THEY MUST HAVE BEEN THE SAME UNENDING DAYS
THE CONFLICTING TINTS BEGAN TO GET IN THEIR DEADLY WORK AND WITHIN TWO HOURS HE WAS COMPLETELY DOUBLED UP THE PAIN HE SUFFERED WAS AWFUL AGONY WAS BLISS ALONGSIDE OF THE PANGS THAT NOW AFFLICTED HIM AND ALL THE PALLIATIVES AND PAIN KILLERS KNOWN TO MAN WERE TRIED WITHOUT AVAIL
AND SWATTED SIR ISAAC NEWTON ON THE NOSE AND THE DRUG STORES WILL BE DRIVEN OUT OF BUSINESS I PRESUME SAID THE DOCTOR
THAT FAINT FLAVOUR OF THE AMERINDIAN ONE SEES AT TIMES IN AMERICAN WOMEN HER VOICE WAS A VERY SOFT AND PLEASING VOICE
ONE MIGHT GET SOMETHING LIKE THE MIND OF THIS PLACE THIRTEEN YOU PUT THEM AT THAT ALREADY THESE PEOPLE YOU THINK WERE RELIGIOUS INTENSELY IN THAT PERSONAL WAY THAT GIVES DEATH A NIGHTMARE TERROR
SAID SIR RICHMOND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE LADY ON THE ROCK RATHER THAN TO THE ANGRY PARENT BELOW HE'S PERFECTLY SAFE AND HAPPY
INDEED THEY'VE FAILED ALTOGETHER TO GET HIM STONEHENGE HE SAYS IS NO GOOD SO HE'S GONE BACK TO CLEAN THE LAMPS OF YOUR CAR
A GREAT PHRASE BUT THE DUST CHOKES ME SAID SIR RICHMOND HE TOOK UP A COPY OF THE GREEN ROADS OF ENGLAND THAT LAY BESIDE HIM ON THE TABLE BUT HE DID NOT OPEN IT
SAID SIR RICHMOND WOOD AND FIBRE HE DECLARED THAT THESE PEOPLE HAD THEIR TOOLS OF WOOD THEIR HOMES OF WOOD
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS MUSIC CURE AND IS IT TRUE THAT OUR MEDICAL SCHOOLS ARE HEREAFTER TO HAVE CONSERVATORIES ATTACHED TO THEM IN WHICH ASPIRING YOUNG M D S ARE TO BE TAUGHT THE MATERIA MUSICA IN ADDITION TO THE MATERIA MEDICA
I DON'T THINK I'M A SUBJECT FOR REAL PSYCHOANALYSIS AT ALL I'M NOT AN OVERLAID SORT OF PERSON WHEN I SPREAD MYSELF OUT THERE IS NOT MUCH INDICATION OF A SUPPRESSED WISH OR OF ANYTHING MASKED OR BURIED OF THAT SORT
WHERE THEY FOUND THE ROAD HEAVY AND DUSTY STILL IN ITS WAR TIME STATE AND SO DOWN A STEEP HILL TO THE WIDE MARKET STREET WHICH IS MARLBOROUGH THEY LUNCHED IN MARLBOROUGH AND WENT ON IN THE AFTERNOON TO SILBURY HILL THAT BRITISH PYRAMID THE LARGEST ARTIFICIAL MOUND IN EUROPE
AND AS FOR THE FADING OF THE ARTISTIC IMPULSE THEY'VE LEFT NOT A TRACE OF THE PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS AND SCRATCHINGS OF THE OLD STONE PEOPLE WHO CAME BEFORE THEM ADULTS WITH THE MINDS OF THIRTEEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN THIRTEEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN WITH THE STRENGTH OF ADULTS
WHAT I SAY I AFTERWARDS FIND DISCONCERTING TO RECALL I WANT TO ALTER IT I CAN FEEL MYSELF WALLOWING INTO A MESS OF MODIFICATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS YES BUT I WANT A REST ANYHOW THERE WAS NOTHING FOR DOCTOR MARTINEAU TO SAY TO THAT
BUT EVEN YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT THE SHOW WAS V V SAID THE LADY IN GREY
BY JOHN KENDRICK BANGS
ONE THOUGHT TOO MUCH OF THE STONES OF THE STONE AGE WHO WOULD CARVE THESE LUMPS OF QUARTZITE WHEN ONE COULD CARVE GOOD OAK OR BEECH A MOST CARVABLE WOOD ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE'S SHARPEST CHISEL WAS A FLINT IT'S WOOD WE OUGHT TO LOOK FOR
EITHER HE REGRETTED THE EXTENT OF HIS CONFIDENCES OR THE SLIGHT IRRATIONAL IRRITATION THAT HE FELT AT WAITING FOR HIS CAR AFFECTED HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS HIS COMPANION OR DOCTOR MARTINEAU'S TENTATIVES WERE ILL CHOSEN AT ANY RATE
THAT I SUPPOSE IS WHAT INTERESTS YOU A VIVID CHILDISH MIND I GUESS WITH NOT A SUSPICION AS YET THAT IT WAS MAN RULING HIS PLANET OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT THE DOCTOR PURSED HIS LIPS NONE HE DELIVERED JUDICIALLY
HE HAD SPENT THE DAY DOWN AT ASBURY PARK AND HAD EATEN NOT WISELY BUT TOO COPIOUSLY
THESE WALLS OF EARTH OUGHT TO TELL WHAT THESE PEOPLE ATE WHAT CLOTHES THEY WORE WHAT WOODS THEY USED WAS THIS A SHEEP LAND THEN AS IT IS NOW OR A CATTLE LAND WERE THESE HILLS COVERED BY FORESTS I DON'T KNOW THESE ARCHAEOLOGISTS DON'T KNOW
AND WERE VERY LEARNED AND INCONCLUSIVE ABOUT THE EXACT PURPOSE OF THIS VAST HEAP OF CHALK AND EARTH THIS HEAP THAT MEN HAD MADE BEFORE THE TEMPLES AT KARNAK WERE BUILT OR BABYLON HAD A NAME THEN THEY RETURNED TO THE CAR AND RAN ROUND BY A WINDING ROAD INTO THE WONDER OF AVEBURY
BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE DESTRUCTION WAS ALREADY DONE BEFORE THE MAYFLOWER SAILED TO THE SOUTHWARD STANDS THE CONE OF SILBURY HILL ITS SHADOW CREEPS UP AND DOWN THE INTERVENING MEADOWS AS THE SEASONS CHANGE
SAID THE DOCTOR HAS LEFT ITS TRACES IN TRADITIONS IN MENTAL PREDISPOSITIONS IN STILL UNANALYZED FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS ARCHAEOLOGY IS VERY LIKE REMEMBERING SAID SIR RICHMOND PRESENTLY WE SHALL REMEMBER A LOT MORE ABOUT ALL THIS
SIR RICHMOND TURNED ABOUT I WOULD LIKE TO DIG UP THE BOTTOM OF THIS DITCH HERE FOOT BY FOOT AND DRY THE STUFF AND SIFT IT VERY CAREFULLY
DESPAIR LIKE THE DESPAIR OF CHILDREN THAT CAN WEEP ITSELF TO SLEEP IT'S OVER WAS IT BATTLE AND MASSACRE THAT ENDED THAT LONG AFTERNOON HERE OR DID THE WOODS CATCH FIRE SOME EXCEPTIONALLY DRY SUMMER LEAVING BLACK HILLS AND FAMINE
YOU RUN A DREADFUL RISK HOWEVER SAID THE DOCTOR WITH A SARCASTIC SMILE THE WAGNER HABIT IS A TERRIBLE THING TO ACQUIRE MISTER IDIOT THAT MAY BE SAID THE IDIOT WORSE THAN THE SULFONAL HABIT BY A GREAT DEAL I AM TOLD
A PEAT BOG HERE EVEN A FEW FEET OF CLAY MIGHT HAVE PICKLED SOME PRECIOUS MEMORANDA NO SUCH LUCK NOW IN GLASTONBURY MARSHES ONE FOUND THE LIFE OF THE EARLY IRON AGE HALF WAY TO OUR OWN TIMES QUITE BEAUTIFULLY PICKLED
LIKE MY DAMNED COMMITTEE DOES WITH THEIR FUEL WASTING AWAY AND THE CLIMATE CHANGING IMPERCEPTIBLY CENTURY BY CENTURY KINGS AND IMPORTANT MEN FOLLOWED ONE ANOTHER HERE FOR CENTURIES AND CENTURIES
I AM A CASE OF FATIGUE UNDER IRRITATING CIRCUMSTANCES WITH VERY LITTLE MENTAL COMPLICATION OR CONCEALMENT YES SAID THE DOCTOR I AGREE YOU ARE NOT A CASE FOR PSYCHOANALYSIS STRICTLY SPEAKING AT ALL YOU ARE IN OPEN CONFLICT WITH YOURSELF
SHE KEEPS ON LOOKING AT IT SAID THE SMALL BOY IT ISUNT ANYTHING
AND WHAT LIKE WERE THOSE WOODEN GODS OF OURS I DON'T REMEMBER BUT I COULD EASILY PERSUADE MYSELF THAT I HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE
SAID THE YOUNG LADY SIR RICHMOND SOUGHT A RECOGNIZABLE DATUM BRONZE GOT TO BRITAIN SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE TIMES OF MOSES AND SOLOMON AH SAID THE YOUNG LADY AS WHO SHOULD SAY THIS MAN AT LEAST TALKS SENSE
SAID PAPA WINNIE GO AND TELL PRICE HE'S GONE BACK TO THE CAR
SAID THE LADY IN GREY WITH THAT RISING INTONATION OF HUMOROUS CONCLUSION WHICH IS SO DISTINCTIVELY AMERICAN THOSE DRUIDS HAVE GOT HIM HE'S HIDING SAID THE AUTOMOBILIST
HE WOULD NOT RISE TO ANY CONVERSATIONAL BAIT THAT THE DOCTOR COULD DEVISE THE DOCTOR FOUND THIS THE MORE REGRETTABLE BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS MUCH TO BE WORKED UPON IN THIS MARTIN LEEDS AFFAIR HE WAS INCLINED TO THINK THAT SHE AND SIR RICHMOND WERE UNDULY OBSESSED BY THE IDEA THAT THEY HAD TO STICK TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE CHILD
THEY WERE IMPEDED AT THE ENTRANCE BY A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN THE KEEPER OF THE TURNSTILE AND A SMALL BUT RESOLUTE BOY OF PERHAPS FIVE OR SIX WHO PROPOSED TO LEAVE THE ENCLOSURE
THE DOCTOR SAW SIR RICHMOND STEP UP ON THE PROSTRATE MEGALITH AND STAND BESIDE HER THE BETTER TO APPRECIATE HER POINT OF VIEW HE SMILED DOWN AT HER NOW WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CAME IN THERE HE ASKED
SNEERED THE DOCTOR IT WOULD SEEM SO SAID THE IDIOT WHILE THE MUSIC CONTINUED MY FRIEND WAS A WELL MAN READY TO GO OUT AND FIGHT LIKE A WARRIOR
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE MUSIC CURE
BUT ALL THIS COUNTRY MAY HAVE BEEN WOODED THEN SAID SIR RICHMOND IN WHICH CASE IT WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD OUT IT DOESN'T STAND OUT SO VERY MUCH EVEN NOW YOU CAME TO IT THROUGH A GROVE SAID THE YOUNG LADY EAGERLY PICKING UP THE IDEA PROBABLY BEECH
AND THE GENERAL EXPECTATION SEEMS TO BE THAT SOME DAY WE SHALL FIND IN MUSIC A CURE FOR ALL OUR HUMAN ILLS AS THE IDIOT SUGGESTS THANK YOU MISTER WHITECHOKER SAID THE IDIOT GRATEFULLY I SAW THAT SAME ITEM AND SEVERAL OTHERS BESIDES
AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD STOOD A TRAVEL STAINED MIDDLE CLASS AUTOMOBILE WITH A MISCELLANY OF DUSTY LUGGAGE RUGS AND LUNCHEON THINGS THEREIN A FAMILY AUTOMOBILE WITH FATHER NO DOUBT AT THE WHEEL SIR RICHMOND LEFT HIS OWN TRIM COUPE AT ITS TAIL
AND DOZED OFF INTO A FATHOMLESS SLEEP I DIDN'T WAKE UP THIS TIME UNTIL NINE O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY THE REST OF THE PARTY HAVING GONE OFF WITHOUT AWAKENING ME AS A SORT OF JOKE
SAID THE CUSTODIAN JEALOUS FOR THE HONOR OF STONEHENGE REMINDS ME OF MARTIN'S LITTLE GIRL SAID SIR RICHMOND AS HE AND DOCTOR MARTINEAU WENT ON TOWARDS THE CIRCLE WHEN SHE ENCOUNTERED HER FIRST DRAGON FLY SHE WAS GREATLY DELIGHTED
I HAVE SEEN A REFERENCE TO IT SOMEWHERE
IT IS SAID TO BE WONDERFULLY EFFICACIOUS WHAT I WANTED TO FIND OUT FROM YOU WAS JUST WHAT COMPOSERS WERE BEST FOR WHICH SPECIFIC TROUBLES YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO SOMEBODY ELSE FOR THE INFORMATION SAID THE DOCTOR
SAID THE IDIOT AS CAPSULE M D ENTERED THE DINING ROOM I AM MIGHTY GLAD YOU'VE COME I'VE WANTED FOR A LONG TIME TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS MUSIC CURE THAT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT AND GET YOU IF POSSIBLE TO WRITE ME OUT A LIST OF MUSICAL NOSTRUMS FOR EVERY DAY USE
SAID THE IDIOT THEY WILL SUBSTITUTE MUSIC FOR DRUGS THAT IS ALL
EXPLAINED THE IDIOT THE CLAIM IS MADE THAT IN MUSIC LIES THE PANACEA FOR ALL HUMAN ILLS
PERHAPS WE SHALL COME HERE AGAIN THE DOCTOR CARRIED ON SIR RICHMOND'S FANCY AFTER ANOTHER FOUR THOUSAND YEARS OR SO WITH DIFFERENT NAMES AND FULLER MINDS AND THEN I SUPPOSE THAT THIS DITCH WON'T BE THE RIDDLE IT IS NOW
HE WAS NOT VERY GOOD AT FEMININE AGES SHE HAD A CLEAR SUN BROWNED COMPLEXION WITH DARK HAIR AND SMILING LIPS HER FEATURES WERE FINELY MODELLED WITH JUST THAT ADDED TOUCH OF BREADTH IN THE BROW AND SOFTNESS IN THE CHEEK BONES
THE RESULTS WERE THE SAME ONLY THE EFFECT WAS INSTANTANEOUS
FOR TWENTY MINUTES ALL WENT SERENELY AND THEN THE MUSIC BEGAN TO WORK I FELL INTO A DEEP AND REFRESHING SLUMBER THE INTERMISSION CAME AND STILL I SLEPT ON EVERYBODY ELSE WENT HOME
A NURSE APPEARED REMOTELY GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE AEROPLANE SHEDS AND HER CRY OF
BUT THE GIG I'M AFRAID THAT WILL HAVE TO GO SAID THE IDIOT AND WHY PRAY ASKED THE DOCTOR
BENEATH THE TREES HE RESTORED A THICKER RICHER SOIL THESE PEOPLE MUST HAVE DONE AN ENORMOUS LOT WITH WOOD THIS USE OF STONES HERE WAS A FREAK
YOU WON'T SEE STONEHENGE EVERY DAY YOUNG MAN SAID THE CUSTODIAN A LITTLE PIQUED IT'S ONLY AN OLD BEACH SAID THE SMALL BOY WITH EXTREME CONVICTION
JUST HOW I HAD TO SAY IT JUST HOW I LOOKED WHILE I SAID IT JUST HOW MUCH I WAS MAKING MYSELF UNDERSTOOD HOW I MIGHT BE MISUNDERSTOOD HOW I MIGHT BE MISREPRESENTED CHALLENGED DENIED ONE DRAWS IN MORE AND MORE AS ONE IS USED UP
I RUBBED MY EYES AND LOOKED ABOUT ME IT WAS TRUE THE GREAT AUDITORIUM WAS EMPTY AND WAS GRADUALLY DARKENING I PUT ON MY HAT AND WALKED OUT REFRESHED HAVING SLEPT FROM FIVE TWENTY UNTIL TWELVE OR SIX HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES STRAIGHT THAT WAS ONE INSTANCE
AND NO ONE TO SLAP THEM OR TELL THEM NOT TO AFTER ALL THEY PROBABLY ONLY THOUGHT OF DEATH NOW AND THEN AND THEY NEVER THOUGHT OF FUEL THEY SUPPOSED THERE WAS NO END TO THAT SO THEY USED UP THEIR WOODS AND KEPT GOATS TO NIBBLE AND KILL THE NEW UNDERGROWTH DID THESE PEOPLE HAVE GOATS
AND THEN JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE HIMSELF UP FOR LOST AN AMATEUR CORNETIST WHO OCCUPIED A STUDIO ON THE FLOOR ABOVE BEGAN TO PLAY THE LOST CHORD A COUNTER PAIN SET IN IMMEDIATELY
SHE SEEMED TO CONCEDE A POINT WICKER IS LIKELIER BUT SURELY SAID THE FATHER OF THE FAMILY WITH THE EXPOSTULATORY VOICE AND GESTURE OF ONE WHO WOULD RECALL ERRING WITS TO SANITY
SIR RICHMOND'S CAR ARRIVED LONG BEFORE TEN BROUGHT DOWN BY A YOUNG MAN IN A STATE OF SCARED ALACRITY SIR RICHMOND HAD DONE SOME VIGOROUS TELEPHONING BEFORE TURNING IN THE CHARMEUSE SET OFF IN A REPAIRED AND CHASTENED CONDITION TO TOWN
THE GREAT WALL IS SUFFICIENT TO EMBRACE THEM ALL WITH THEIR GARDENS AND PADDOCKS FOUR CROSS ROADS MEET AT THE VILLAGE CENTRE
SECTION THREE IN THE EVENING AFTER DINNER DOCTOR MARTINEAU SOUGHT RATHER UNSUCCESSFULLY TO GO ON WITH THE ANALYSIS OF SIR RICHMOND BUT SIR RICHMOND WAS EVIDENTLY A CREATURE OF MOODS
UPON MORAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES PRACTICALLY OPEN YOUR PROBLEMS ARE PROBLEMS OF CONSCIOUS CONDUCT AS I SAID OF WHAT RENUNCIATIONS YOU HAVE CONSCIOUSLY TO MAKE SIR RICHMOND DID NOT ANSWER THAT
CLUMSY TREASURE HUNTING SIR RICHMOND SAID THEY BORE INTO SILBURY HILL AND EXPECT TO FIND A MUMMIFIED CHIEF OR SOMETHING SENSATIONAL OF THAT SORT AND THEY DON'T AND THEY REPORT NOTHING THEY HAVEN'T SIFTED FINELY ENOUGH
SHE WAS A BLACK HAIRED SUN BURNT INDIVIDUAL AND SHE STOOD WITH HER ARMS AKIMBO QUITE FRANKLY AMUSED AT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MASTER ANTHONY AND OFFERING NO SORT OF HELP FOR HIS RECOVERY
I DO NOT THINK THAT I SHALL STIR UP MY MOTIVES ANY MORE FOR A TIME BETTER TO GO ON INTO THE WEST COUNTRY COOLING MY POOR OLD BRAIN IN THESE WIDE SHADOWS OF THE PAST I CAN PRESCRIBE NOTHING BETTER SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU
LIFE DIDN'T SEEM SO COMPLICATED THEN SIR RICHMOND MUSED OUR MUDDLES WERE UNCONSCIOUS WE DRIFTED FROM MOOD TO MOOD AND FORGOT THERE WAS MORE SUNSHINE THEN MORE LAUGHTER PERHAPS AND BLACKER DESPAIR
STROLLED UP THE DOWN TO THE NORTHWARD TO GET A GENERAL VIEW OF THE VILLAGE HAD TEA AND SMOKED ROUND THE WALLS AGAIN IN THE WARM APRIL SUNSET THE MATTER OF THEIR CONVERSATION REMAINED PREHISTORIC
THEY TOOK A TURN ABOUT THE WALLS WITH THE MOON SINKING OVER BEYOND SILBURY
AS THEY APPROACHED THE GREY OLD STONES THEY BECAME AWARE OF A CERTAIN AGITATION AMONG THEM A VOICE AN AUTHORITATIVE BASS VOICE WAS AUDIBLE CRYING
AND WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE GIGANTIC SURVIVORS OF THE GREAT CIRCLES OF UNHEWN STONE THAT EVEN AS LATE AS TUDOR DAYS WERE ALMOST COMPLETE A WHOLE VILLAGE A CHURCH A PRETTY MANOR HOUSE HAVE BEEN BUILT FOR THE MOST PART OUT OF THE ANCIENT MEGALITHS
THE TWO GENTLEMEN SMOKED FOR SOME TIME IN A SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE DOCTOR MARTINEAU CLEARED HIS THROAT TWICE AND LIT A SECOND CIGAR THEY THEN AGREED TO ADMIRE THE BRIDGE AND THINK WELL OF MAIDENHEAD SIR RICHMOND COMMUNICATED HOPEFUL NEWS ABOUT HIS CAR
THEN DESERVES TO RANK AMONG THE MOST EFFECTIVE NARCOTICS KNOWN TO MODERN SCIENCE
THAT TWO DOSES OF WAGNER BROUGHT ABOUT IN ONE INSTANT AND BEST OF ALL THERE WAS NO REACTION NO SPLITTING HEADACHE OR SHAKY HAND THE NEXT DAY
FIBRE OF ALL SORTS WADDED STUFF STONEHENGE DRAPED IT'S REALLY A DELIGHTFUL IDEA SAID THE FATHER OF THE FAMILY ENJOYING IT IT'S QUITE A POSSIBLE ONE SAID SIR RICHMOND OR THEY MAY HAVE USED WICKER
THAT IT CONTAINS THE GERM OF PERPETUAL MOTION I WILL CONSIDER YOUR SUGGESTION REPLIED THE IDIOT MEANWHILE LET US CONSULT HARMONIOUSLY TOGETHER ON THE ORIGINAL POINT
THEY CAME IN THERE AND WENT ROUND THE INNER CIRCLE WITH THEIR TORCHES AND SO THEY WERE SHOWN THE TORCHES WERE PUT OUT AND THE PRIESTS DID THEIR MYSTERIES UNTIL DAWN BROKE THAT IS HOW THEY WORKED IT
BUT WHEN THE CORNETIST STOPPED THE COLIC RETURNED AND HE HAD TO FIGHT IT OUT IN THE OLD WAY IN THESE EPISODES IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE I FIND AMPLE JUSTIFICATION FOR MY BELIEF AND THAT OF OTHERS THAT SOME DAY THE MUSIC CURE FOR HUMAN AILMENTS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AND DEVELOPED TO THE FULL
HOW IS ONE TO GET THE AVEBURY FRAME OF MIND TO WESTMINSTER WHEN WESTMINSTER IS AS DEAD AS AVEBURY SAID THE DOCTOR UNHELPFULLY HE ADDED AFTER SOME SECONDS MILTON KNEW OF THESE TROUBLES NOT WITHOUT DUST AND HEAT HE WROTE
HE WAS NOT FITTED BY TEMPERAMENT TO ASSIMILATE ANYTHING QUITE SO STRENUOUSLY CHROMATIC AS THAT
THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY FOUND SOME DIFFICULTY IT WOULD SEEM IN READJUSTING HIS MIND TO THE COMPARATIVE INNOCENCE OF ANTHONY AND SIR RICHMOND AND THE YOUNG LADY ON THE ROCK SOUGHT AS IF BY COMMON IMPULSE TO ESTABLISH A GENERAL CONVERSATION THERE WERE FAINT TRACES OF EXCITEMENT IN HER MANNER
THE ENCOUNTER AT STONEHENGE SECTION ONE NEXT DAY IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON AFTER A FAREWELL WALK OVER THE DOWNS ROUND AVEBURY THEY WENT BY WAY OF DEVIZES AND NETHERAVON AND AMESBURY TO STONEHENGE DOCTOR MARTINEAU HAD SEEN THIS ANCIENT MONUMENT BEFORE
THIS PILGRIMAGE OF OURS HE SAID PRESENTLY HAS MADE FOR MAGNANIMITY THIS DAY PARTICULARLY HAS BEEN A GOOD DAY WHEN WE STOOD ON THIS OLD WALL HERE IN THE SUNSET I SEEMED TO BE STANDING OUTSIDE MYSELF IN AN IMMENSE STILL SPHERE OF PAST AND FUTURE
AND PHYSICAL RELIEF WAS INSTANT
AND ONE OR TWO OTHER FEMININE PERSONALITIES PRODUCED EFFECTS OF MOVEMENT RATHER THAN OF INDIVIDUALITY AS THEY FLITTED AMONG THE STONES
INCIDENTALLY WE MAY BE ABLE TO THROW A LITTLE MORE LIGHT ON ONE OR TWO OF YOUR MINOR ENTANGLEMENTS I DON'T WANT TO THINK OF THEM SAID SIR RICHMOND LET ME GET RIGHT AWAY FROM EVERYTHING UNTIL MY SKIN HAS GROWN AGAIN CHAPTER THE SIXTH
AND WHEN SHE HAD SPOKEN DOCTOR MARTINEAU NOTED THAT SHE LOOKED AT SIR RICHMOND AS IF SHE EXPECTED HIM AT LEAST TO CONFIRM HER VISION SIR RICHMOND WAS EVIDENTLY PREPARED TO CONFIRM IT WITH A QUEER LITTLE TWINGE OF INFRINGED PROPRIETORSHIP
OR DID STRANGE MEN BRING A SICKNESS MEASLES PERHAPS OR THE BLACK DEATH OR WAS IT CATTLE PEST OR DID WE JUST WASTE OUR WOODS AND DWINDLE AWAY BEFORE THE NEW PEOPLES THAT CAME INTO THE LAND ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SEA I CAN'T REMEMBER
AND AFTER A LEISURELY BREAKFAST OUR TWO INVESTIGATORS INTO THE SPRINGS OF HUMAN CONDUCT WERE ABLE TO RESUME THEIR WESTWARD JOURNEY THEY RAN THROUGH SCATTERED TWYFORD WITH ITS PLEASANT LOOKING INNS AND THROUGH THE COMMONPLACE URBANITIES OF READING
I STOOD WITH MY FEET UPON THE STONE AGE AND SAW MYSELF FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AWAY AND ALL MY DISTRESSES AS VERY LITTLE INCIDENTS IN THAT PERSPECTIVE AWAY THERE IN LONDON THE CASE IS ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT
IN ADDITION TO THIS EXPERIENCE
SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT WILL DEMONSTRATE BEFORE LONG WHAT COMPOSITION WILL CURE SPECIFIC ILLS
CAN BRING HIM BACK TO HEALTH AGAIN WITH THREE BARS OF UNDER THE BAMBOO TREE AFTER EACH MEAL INSTEAD OF DOSING KIDS WITH COD LIVER OIL WHEN THEY NEED A TONIC THEY WILL BE SET TO WORK AT A MECHANICAL PIANO AND BRACED UP ON NARCISSUS
BECAUSE OF THE LOOK OF THE THING AND SO FORTH AND THAT REALLY EACH MIGHT BE STRUGGLING AGAINST A VERY STRONG IMPULSE INDEED TO BREAK OFF THE AFFAIR IT SEEMED EVIDENT TO THE DOCTOR THAT THEY JARRED UPON AND ANNOYED EACH OTHER EXTREMELY
THE MAN AT THE TURNSTILE MUTELY CONSULTED THE DOCTOR
A GLASS OF FRESH CIDER AND A SAUCERFUL OF PISTACHE ICE CREAM
YOUR LIBIDO IS I SHOULD SAY EXCEPTIONALLY FREE GENERALLY YOU ARE DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO OVERDOING IN FACT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND GETTING SIMPLY TIRED WHICH IS THE THEORY I STARTED WITH
AND NO HUMAN BEING EVER HAD A SHOW YET WITHOUT TRYING TO SHUT PEOPLE OUT OF IT IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM COME IN I GUESS THIS WAS COVERED IN ALL RIGHT A DARK HUNCHED OLD PLACE IN A WOOD BEECH STEMS SMOOTH LIKE PILLARS AND THEY CAME TO IT AT NIGHT IN PROCESSION
THE EXCITEMENT ABOUT MASTER ANTHONY COLLAPSED
AND AS FOR THE MUSIC CURE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT HAVEN'T HEARD EVERYBODY TALKING ABOUT IT AND
EASTWARD TO THE CROSSING AT THE STRAITS AND WESTWARD TO WALES TO FERRIES OVER THE SEVERN AND SOUTHWESTWARD INTO DEVON AND CORNWALL THE DOCTOR AND SIR RICHMOND WALKED ROUND THE WALLS SURVEYED THE SHADOW CAST BY SILBURY UPON THE RIVER FLATS
WHAT YOU GET IS A QUITE OPEN AND RECOGNIZED DISCORD OF TWO SETS OF MOTIVES THE DOCTOR CONSIDERED
AT LAST ONE IS REDUCED TO A LITTLE RAW BLEEDING DESPERATELY FIGHTING PIN POINT OF SELF ONE GOES BACK TO ONE'S HOME UNABLE TO RECOVER FIGHTING IT OVER AGAIN ALL NIGHT SOMETIMES I GET UP AND WALK ABOUT THE ROOM AND CURSE MARTINEAU
THESE TRACKWAYS THESE GREEN ROADS OF ENGLAND THESE ROADS ALREADY DISUSED WHEN THE ROMANS MADE THEIR HIGHWAY PAST SILBURY HILL TO BATH CAN STILL BE TRACED FOR SCORES OF MILES THROUGH THE LAND RUNNING TO SALISBURY AND THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
AGE BY AGE OUT OF THE SOUTH WE SHALL REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES WE MADE AND THE CRAZY REASONS WHY WE MADE THEM WE SOWED OUR CORN IN BLOOD HERE WE HAD STRANGE FANCIES ABOUT THE STARS THOSE WE BROUGHT WITH US OUT OF THE SOUTH WHERE THE STARS ARE BRIGHTER
ALSO TREATS IT WITH CONTEMPT AND NEGLECT NOW ALL THIS WOULD NOT SO MUCH MATTER IF IT DID NOT DELUDE THOSE WHOSE TASTE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY EDUCATED TO ENABLE THEM TO FORM AN OPINION OF THEIR OWN
WHOSE OBJECT IS TO BRING TOGETHER BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS OF ALL KINDS TO A PLACE WHERE THEY MAY BE SEEN ARE OF THE UTMOST VALUE AND THAT ANY SHOWS ANYWHERE FOR A LIKE PURPOSE AND ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE ARE NO MONEY PRIZES
QUANTITIES OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS IT CANNOT BUT BE PERCEIVED BY ALL WHO HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT OF SOME REFINEMENT OF EDUCATION THAT IN VERY MANY CASES THEY EITHER DELIBERATELY TEACH OR AT ANY RATE ALLOW TO BE SEEN WITH THEIR SANCTION
BUT ALSO IN THE HOME PRODUCTION OF IMPROVED KINDS OF OLD FAVOURITES
NOW BEING FOLLOWED BY COLOURED ONES OF THE SAME HABIT SEEMS TO ME WORTHY OF NOTHING BUT CONDEMNATION IT WOULD BE AS RIGHT AND SENSIBLE TO DWARF A HOLLYHOCK INTO A PODGY MASS A FOOT HIGH
FOR ALL THESE FALSE GODS ARE AMONG US
AND MUCH AS I FEEL GRATEFUL TO THOSE WHO IMPROVE GARDEN FLOWERS I VENTURE TO REPEAT MY STRONG CONVICTION THAT THEIR EFFORTS IN SELECTION AND OTHER METHODS SHOULD BE SO DIRECTED
BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT MANY IF NOT MOST OF THE PLANTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY MADE MUCH UGLIER BY THE PROCESS TAKE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE DWARFEST AGERATUMS
TWO TRAVELLERS WALKING IN THE NOONDAY SUN SOUGHT THE SHADE OF A WIDESPREADING TREE TO REST AS THEY LAY LOOKING UP AMONG THE PLEASANT LEAVES THEY SAW THAT IT WAS A PLANE TREE
AND AT THE LONDON SHOWS THERE ARE NOW CLASSES FOR BORDER CARNATIONS SET UP IN LONG STALKED BUNCHES JUST AS THEY GROW IT IS ONLY LIKE THIS THAT THEIR VALUE AS OUTDOOR PLANTS CAN BE TESTED
MAY REACH THIS CLASS OF SHOW FOR THERE ARE ALREADY MORE HOPEFUL SIGNS IN THE ADMISSION OF CLASSES FOR GROUPS ARRANGED FOR DECORATION THE PRIZE SHOW SYSTEM NO DOUBT CREATES ITS OWN EVILS BECAUSE THE JUDGES
IN INFERRING FROM THIS THAT ALL ANNUALS ARE THE BETTER FOR DWARFING I TAKE IT THAT THE BEDDING SYSTEM HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO WITH IT IT NO DOUBT ENABLES IGNORANT GARDENERS TO USE A LARGER VARIETY OF PLANTS
THE SHEPHERD BOY AGAIN SHOUTED WOLF WOLF AGAIN THE VILLAGERS RAN TO HELP HIM ONLY TO BE LAUGHED AT AGAIN THEN ONE EVENING
AS THE PLANT HAS BEEN PROPAGATED AT EVERY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT AND ONE MAY CHOOSE WHAT ONE WILL BUT TO SEE THEM TOGETHER IS AN INSTRUCTIVE LESSON NO ANNUAL PLANT
THE NATURAL HABIT OF THE CHRYSANTHEMUM IS TO GROW IN THE FORM OF SEVERAL UPRIGHT STEMS THEY SPRING UP SHEAF WISE STRAIGHT UPRIGHT FOR A TIME AND ONLY BENDING A LITTLE OUTWARDS ABOVE TO GIVE ROOM FOR THE BRANCHING HEADS OF BLOOM
THE STEMS ARE RATHER STIFF BECAUSE THEY ARE HALF WOODY AT THE BASE IN THE CASE OF POT PLANTS IT WOULD SEEM RIGHT ONLY SO FAR TO STAKE OR TRAIN THEM AS TO GIVE THE NECESSARY SUPPORT
THAT IT IS RIGHT AND LAUDABLE TO DEVOTE TO IT MUCH TIME AND DELICATE WORKMANSHIP I CANNOT BUT THINK AS WELL AS HOPE THAT THE STRONG INFLUENCES FOR GOOD THAT ARE NOW BEING BROUGHT TO BEAR ON ALL DEPARTMENTS OF GARDENING
SO THAT A FLOWER MAY POSSESS FEATURES OR QUALITIES THAT ENDOW IT WITH THE HIGHEST BEAUTY BUT THAT EXCLUDE IT BECAUSE THE HARD AND NARROW LIMITS OF THE SHOW LAWS PROVIDE NO MEANS OF DEALING WITH IT IT IS THEREFORE THROWN OUT
HAS OF LATE YEARS BEEN SO MUCH IMPROVED AS THE SWEET PEA AND ONE REASON WHY ITS CHARMING BEAUTY AND SCENT ARE SO ENJOYABLE IS THAT THEY GROW TALL AND CAN BE SEEN ON A LEVEL WITH THE EYE
HE MADE READY TO FLY AWAY BUT BEFORE HE LEFT HE BEGGED THE BULL'S PARDON FOR HAVING USED HIS HORN FOR A RESTING PLACE YOU MUST BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE ME GO NOW HE SAID
AS TO KEEP IN VIEW THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND AS A POINT OF HONOUR NOT TO MERE INCREASE OF SIZE OF BLOOM OR COMPACTNESS OF HABIT MANY PLANTS HAVE BEEN SPOILT BY EXCESS OF BOTH
AND IN NOT KNOWING WHEN OR WHERE TO STOP ABNORMAL SIZE WHETHER GREATLY ABOVE OR MUCH BELOW THE AVERAGE APPEALS TO THE VULGAR AND UNEDUCATED EYE AND WILL ALWAYS COMMAND ITS ATTENTION AND WONDERMENT
WITH A NARROW RING OF RED ROUND THE CENTRE THE IMPROVER HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE THE WIDTH OF THE RED RING UP TO A CERTAIN POINT IT MAKES A LIVELIER AND BRIGHTER LOOKING FLOWER BUT HE HAS GONE TOO FAR AND EXTENDED THE RED
IT LOSES SIGHT OF ITS HONOURABLE POSITION AS A TRUSTWORTHY EXPONENT OF HORTICULTURE AND HAS DEGENERATED TO A BASER USE WHEN AS IN CHRYSANTHEMUM SHOWS
AND WHEN PRIVATE GARDENERS GO TO THESE SHOWS AND SEE HOW THE PRIZES ARE AWARDED AND HOW ALL THE GLORY IS ACCORDED TO THE FIRST PRIZE BLOATED MONSTER CAN WE WONDER THAT THE EFFECT ON THEIR MINDS IS CONFUSING
OVER AN INTERNAL SCAFFOLDING OF STICKS WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF TIES AND CROSS BRACES SO THAT IT MAKES A SORT OF SHAPELESS BALL AND TO ARRANGE THE FLOWERS SO THAT THEY ARE EQUALLY SPOTTED ALL OVER IT BY TYING BACK SOME ALMOST TO SNAPPING POINT
DOES THIS REALLY HELP THE BEST INTERESTS OF HORTICULTURE AND AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THAT IT DOES THIS I THINK THE SHOW RIGHT AND HELPFUL AND WHENEVER IT DOES NOT I THINK IT HARMFUL AND MISLEADING
BUT THE SHOW DECREES THAT ALL THIS IS WRONG AND THAT THE TINY BRITTLE BRANCHES MUST BE TRAINED STIFFLY ROUND TILL THE SHAPE OF THE PLANT SHOWS AS A SORT OF CYLINDER AGAIN I ASK MYSELF WHAT IS THIS FOR WHAT DOES IT TEACH
IN ALL THE BEST SENSE IS PUT ASIDE IN FAVOUR OF SET RULES AND MEASUREMENTS AND THE PRODUCTION OF A THING THAT IS OF NO USE OR VALUE AND INDIVIDUALS OF A RACE OF PLANTS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE HIGHEST AND MOST DELIGHTFUL FORMS OF BEAUTY
THE BOY RAN TOWARD THE VILLAGE SHOUTING WOLF WOLF BUT THOUGH THE VILLAGERS HEARD THE CRY THEY DID NOT RUN TO HELP HIM AS THEY HAD BEFORE HE CANNOT FOOL US AGAIN
SOME DAYS LATER WHILE STALKING HIS PREY IN THE FOREST THE LION WAS CAUGHT IN THE TOILS OF A HUNTER'S NET UNABLE TO FREE HIMSELF HE FILLED THE FOREST WITH HIS ANGRY ROARING
THERE HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE ADVANCE AND HERE AGAIN THOUGH MANY REALLY BEAUTIFUL THINGS ARE BEING BROUGHT FORWARD THERE SEEMS ALWAYS TO BE AN UNDUE VALUE ASSIGNED TO A FRESH DEVELOPMENT ON THE SCORE OF ITS NOVELTY
FOR MANY OF THE SHOW SORTS HAVE MISERABLY WEAK STALKS AND A VERY POOR LANKY HABIT OF GROWTH THEN THE POOR PANSIES HAVE SINGLE BLOOMS LAID FLAT ON WHITE PAPERS AND ARE ONLY APPROVED
THAT GIVE THEM A KIND OF ABSURD PRETTINESS AND A CERTAIN GARDEN VALUE I ALSO LOOK AT THEM AS A LITTLE FLORAL JOKE THAT IS HARMLESS AND NOT DISPLEASING
AS WITH THE CHRYSANTHEMUM EVERY SORT OF TRICKERY IS ALLOWED IN ARRANGING THE PETALS OF THE CARNATION BLOOMS PETALS ARE PULLED OUT OR STUCK IN AND THEY ARE TWISTED ABOUT AND GROOMED AND COMBED AND MANIPULATED WITH SPECIAL TOOLS
THAN IN THE EYES OF OUR NEIGHBOR THE SMALLER THE MIND
A SHEPHERD BOY TENDED HIS MASTER'S SHEEP NEAR A DARK FOREST NOT FAR FROM THE VILLAGE SOON HE FOUND LIFE IN THE PASTURE VERY DULL ALL HE COULD DO
IS NOT ENCOURAGED OR EVEN ALLOWED TO DEVELOP THAT BEAUTY BUT IS TRAINED INTO SOME SHAPE THAT IS NOT ONLY FOREIGN TO ITS OWN NATURE BUT IS ABSOLUTELY UGLY AND UNGRACEFUL AND ENTIRELY STUPID
FOR IT IS NOT ONLY IN THE INDIVIDUAL BLOOMS THAT MUCH OF THE SHOW TEACHING IS UNWORTHY BUT ALSO IN THE TRAINING OF THE PLANTS SO THAT A PLANT THAT BY NATURE HAS SOME BEAUTY OF FORM
THE INTRODUCTION OF A BETTER CLASS OF RED COLOURING
THE WORSHIP OF FALSE GODS SEVERAL TIMES DURING THESE NOTES I HAVE SPOKEN IN A DISPARAGING MANNER OF THE SHOW TABLE AND I HAVE NOT DONE SO LIGHTLY BUT WITH ALL THE CARE AND THOUGHT AND POWER OF OBSERVATION
AND THOSE WHO FRAME THE SCHEDULES HAVE BEEN IN MOST CASES MEN WHO HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF FLOWERS BUT WHO ARE NOT PEOPLE OF CULTIVATED TASTE AND IN DECIDING WHAT POINTS ARE TO CONSTITUTE THE MERITS OF A FLOWER
THERE CAN BE NO EXCUSE WHATEVER FOR DWARFING THIS AS HAS LATELY BEEN DONE THERE ARE ALREADY PLENTY OF GOOD FLOWERING PLANTS UNDER A FOOT HIGH AND THE LITTLE DWARF WHITE MONSTROSITY
OH IT IS ONE OF THE WAYS THEY ARE TRAINED FOR SHOWS I ASK HIM DOES HE THINK IT PRETTY OR IS IT ANY USE AND HE SAYS WELL THEY THINK IT MAKES A NICE VARIETY AND WHEN I PRESS HIM FURTHER
HOW USELESS IS THE PLANE SAID ONE OF THEM IT BEARS NO FRUIT WHATEVER AND ONLY SERVES TO LITTER THE GROUND WITH LEAVES UNGRATEFUL CREATURES
NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE ANY FAULT TO FIND WITH IT BUT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONCERN THEM AND THE ORDINARY GARDENER TO WHOSE PRACTICE IT MIGHT BE OF THE HIGHEST VALUE ACCEPTING THE VERDICT OF THE SHOW JUDGE AS AN INFALLIBLE GUIDE
NOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AMONG THE THOUSANDS OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS ALREADY AT HAND FOR GARDEN USE THERE IS NO MERIT WHATEVER IN NOVELTY OR VARIETY UNLESS THE THING NEW OR DIFFERENT IS DISTINCTLY MORE BEAUTIFUL
THE QUESTION IS BEYOND HIM AND HE SMILES VAGUELY AND EDGES AWAY EVIDENTLY THINKING MY CONVERSATION PERPLEXING AND MY COMPANY UNDESIRABLE
AND SEEMING TO SAY WE WERE REALLY A GOOD BIT MILDEWED BUT HAVE BEEN DOCTORED UP FOR THE SHOW BY BEING CRAMMED AND STUFFED WITH ARTIFICIAL ALIMENT MY SECOND EXAMPLE IS THAT OF AZALEA INDICA
WHAT CANNOT FAIL TO BE DEBASING TO PUBLIC TASTE I WILL JUST TAKE TWO EXAMPLES TO SHOW HOW OBVIOUS METHODS OF LEADING TASTE ARE NOT ONLY OVERLOOKED BUT EVEN PERVERTED
THE MOUSE KNEW THE VOICE AND QUICKLY FOUND THE LION STRUGGLING IN THE NET RUNNING TO ONE OF THE GREAT ROPES THAT BOUND HIM SHE GNAWED IT UNTIL IT PARTED AND SOON THE LION WAS FREE
ALL IDEA OF GARDEN DELIGHT SEEMS TO BE EXCLUDED AS THIS KIND OF JUDGING APPEALS TO NO RECOGNITION OF BEAUTY FOR BEAUTY'S SAKE BUT TO HARD SYSTEMS OF MEASUREMENT
FOR THE PODGY LITTLE DWARF SNAPDRAGONS THEY ARE UNGRACEFUL LITTLE DUMPY THINGS
THAT IS INCREASED BY DIVISION AS WELL AS BY SEED
BUT THEN THE PRODUCTION OF THE IMMENSE SIZE THAT PROVOKES ASTONISHMENT AND THE MISAPPLIED INGENUITY THAT PRODUCES UNUSUAL DWARFING ARE NEITHER OF THEM VERY HIGH AIMS
WHEN THIS KIND CAME OUT IT WAS A NOTEWORTHY NOVELTY NOT BECAUSE IT WAS A NOVELTY BUT BECAUSE IT WAS A BETTER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THING
WHOSE RED AND PINK COLOURINGS HAD HITHERTO BEEN OF A BAD AND RANK QUALITY IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT HERE AND THERE THE DWARF KIND IS A DISTINCTLY USEFUL THING
THEY HAVE TO TAKE SUCH QUALITIES AS ARE WITHIN THE CLEAREST UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE AND AVERAGE EDUCATION SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS SIZE THAT CAN BE MEASURED SYMMETRY THAT CAN BE EASILY ESTIMATED THICKNESS OF PETAL THAT CAN BE FELT
AND NOT ANYTHING OF THE NATURE OF FASHION OR FANCY AND THAT EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TOWARDS THE RAISING RATHER THAN THE LOWERING OF THE STANDARD OF TASTE THE SOCIETIES WHICH EXIST THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ARE WELL ORGANISED
SO THAT EACH STEM MAY LEAN A LITTLE OVER
I AM OF OPINION THAT THE SHOW TABLE IS UNWORTHILY USED WHEN ITS OBJECT IS TO BE AN END IN ITSELF AND THAT IT SHOULD BE ONLY A MEANS TO A BETTER END AND THAT WHEN IT EXHIBITS WHAT HAS BECOME MERELY A FANCY
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BEST AND TRUEST STANDARDS OF BEAUTY FOR I VENTURE TO REPEAT THAT WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR GARDENS AND FOR OUR OWN BETTERING AND INCREASE OF HAPPINESS IN THOSE GARDENS ARE THINGS THAT ARE BEAUTIFUL
ARE INVARIABLY SPATTERED WITH SOIL IN HEAVY AUTUMN RAIN AN EXAMPLE OF THE IMPROVER NOT KNOWING WHERE TO STOP IN THE MATTER OF COLOURING ALWAYS STRIKES ME IN THE GAILLARDIAS
NOR HAVE I EVER SEEN ELSEWHERE ANY THAT I THINK CAN COMPARE WITH IT
DRESSED AS THE SHOW WORD HAS IT DRESSED SO ELABORATELY THAT THE DRESSING ONLY STOPS SHORT OF APPLYING ACTUAL PAINT AND PERFUMERY ALREADY IN THE CASE OF CARNATIONS A BETTER INFLUENCE IS BEING FELT
SAID A VOICE FROM THE PLANE TREE YOU LIE HERE IN MY COOLING SHADE AND YET YOU SAY I AM USELESS THUS UNGRATEFULLY O JUPITER DO MEN RECEIVE THEIR BLESSINGS
NOT FOR VARIETY OR NOVELTY AS ENDS IN THEMSELVES BUT ONLY TO WELCOME THEM AND OFFER THEM IF THEY ARE DISTINCTLY OF GARDEN VALUE IN THE BEST SENSE FOR IF PLANTS ARE GROWN OR ADVERTISED OR OTHERWISE PUSHED
FLORISTS FLOWERS BY WHICH I MEAN THOSE THAT FIND FAVOUR IN THE EXCLUSIVE SHOWS OF SOCIETIES FOR THE GROWING AND EXHIBITION OF SUCH FLOWERS AS TULIPS CARNATIONS DAHLIAS AND CHRYSANTHEMUMS IN SUPPORT OF THIS I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
THAT MY LIMITED CAPACITY IS WORTH AND BROADLY I HAVE COME TO THIS THAT SHOWS SUCH AS THOSE AT THE FORTNIGHTLY MEETINGS OF THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY AND THEIR MORE IMPORTANT ONE IN THE EARLY SUMMER
THE RED ALSO IS OF A RATHER DULL AND HEAVY NATURE SO THAT INSTEAD OF A HANDSOME YELLOW FLOWER WITH A BROAD CENTRAL RING HERE IS AN UGLY RED ONE WITH A YELLOW BORDER THERE IS NO POSITIVE HARM DONE
NO USE ANYWHERE BUT ON THAT BOARD AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF GAINING A MONEY PRIZE I HOLD THAT THE SHOW TABLE HAS A DEBASED AIM AND A DEBASING INFLUENCE BEAUTY
IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME REPLIED THE BULL I DID NOT EVEN KNOW YOU WERE THERE WE ARE OFTEN OF GREATER IMPORTANCE IN OUR OWN EYES
THOUGH HE HAD NOT SEEN ANYTHING THAT EVEN LOOKED LIKE A WOLF HE RAN TOWARD THE VILLAGE SHOUTING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE WOLF WOLF AS HE EXPECTED THE VILLAGERS WHO HEARD THE CRY
WHICH IN A WAY OBLIGES ALL TO FOLLOW WHERE SOME LEAD I TRUST
SAID THE MOUSE NOW YOU SEE THAT EVEN A MOUSE CAN HELP A LION A KINDNESS
TO AMUSE HIMSELF WAS TO TALK TO HIS DOG OR PLAY ON HIS SHEPHERD'S PIPE ONE DAY AS HE SAT WATCHING THE SHEEP AND THE QUIET FOREST AND THINKING WHAT HE WOULD DO SHOULD HE SEE A WOLF
BEING ALL BOUND IN A KIND OF BONDAGE TO THE GENERAL SYSTEM AND THERE IS ONE GREAT EVIL THAT CALLS LOUDLY FOR REDRESS
A GNAT FLEW OVER THE MEADOW WITH MUCH BUZZING FOR SO SMALL A CREATURE AND SETTLED ON THE TIP OF ONE OF THE HORNS OF A BULL AFTER HE HAD RESTED A SHORT TIME
TOPPING A STUNTED SPIKE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FIXED AND IS BEING OFFERED AS A NOVELTY HERE IS ONE OF THE CLEAREST EXAMPLES OF A NEW DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS A DISTINCT DEBASEMENT OF A NATURALLY BEAUTIFUL FORM
THAT DISPLAYS TO PERFECTION THE ADMIRABLE DELICACY OF VELVETY TEXTURE ALL THE LITTLE TENDER TRICKS AND WAYS THAT MAKE THE PANSY ONE OF THE BEST LOVED OF GARDEN FLOWERS ALL THIS IS OVERLOOKED
AS THE SUN WAS SETTING BEHIND THE FOREST AND THE SHADOWS WERE CREEPING OUT OVER THE PASTURE A WOLF REALLY DID SPRING FROM THE UNDERBRUSH AND FALL UPON THE SHEEP IN TERROR
AND RIGID ARRANGEMENT AND COMPUTATION THAT ONE WOULD THINK MORE APPLICABLE TO ASTRONOMY OR GEOMETRY THAN TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO HORTICULTURE I DO MOST STRONGLY URGE THAT BEAUTY OF THE HIGHEST CLASS SHOULD BE THE AIM
IF THEY WILL LIE QUITE FLAT AND SHOW AN OUTLINE OF A PERFECT CIRCLE ALL THAT IS MOST BEAUTIFUL IN A PANSY THE WING LIKE CURVES THE WAVED OR SLIGHTLY FLUTED RADIATIONS THE SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE
MAY BE A DISTINCT GAIN TO HORTICULTURE IT MAY JUST MAKE A GOOD GARDEN PLANT OUT OF ONE THAT WAS FORMERLY OF INDIFFERENT QUALITY BUT THERE SEEMS TO ME TO BE A KIND OF STUPIDITY
WHEREAS A REASONABLY DOUBLE ONE WELL BRANCHED AND TWO FEET HIGH IS A HANDSOME PLANT I ALSO THINK THAT STOCKS AND WALLFLOWERS ARE MUCH HANDSOMER WHEN RATHER TALL AND BRANCHING DWARF STOCKS MOREOVER
WHEN THEIR CLUSTERED HEADS OF FLOWER WOULD BE GIVEN ENOUGH ROOM AND BE SEEN TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE BUT AT SHOWS THE TRIUMPH OF THE TRAINING ART SEEMS TO BE TO DRAG THE POOR THING ROUND AND ROUND
ARE ALSO SURE TO BE HELPFUL
IF NOT ABSOLUTELY HARMFUL SHOWS OF CARNATIONS AND PANSIES WHERE THE OLDER RULES PREVAIL ARE EQUALLY MISLEADING
WHAT IS PRETTIER IN A ROOM THAN ONE OF THESE IN ITS LITTLE TREE FORM A TRUE TREE WITH TINY TRUNK AND WIDE SPREADING BRANCHES AND ITS ABSURDLY LARGE AND LOVELY FLOWERS SURELY IT IS THE MOST PERFECT ROOM ORNAMENT
DROPPED THEIR WORK AND RAN IN GREAT EXCITEMENT TO THE PASTURE BUT WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY FOUND THE BOY DOUBLED UP WITH LAUGHTER AT THE TRICK HE HAD PLAYED ON THEM A FEW DAYS LATER
IN THIS GRAND PLANT ONE IS GLAD TO HAVE DWARF ONES AS WELL AS THE OLD TRAILING KINDS
THAT WE CAN HAVE IN TREE SHAPE IN A MODERATE SIZED POT AND WHERE ELSE CAN ONE SEE A TREE LOADED WITH LOVELY BLOOM WHOSE INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS HAVE A DIAMETER EQUAL TO FIVE TIMES THAT OF THE TRUNK
THE LOVE OF GARDENING HAS SO GREATLY GROWN AND SPREAD WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT THE NEED OF REALLY GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL GARDEN FLOWERS IS ALREADY FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE DEMAND FOR THE SO CALLED
TRAINED IN THIS MANNER SUCH A SIGHT GIVES ME A FEELING OF SHAME NOT UNMIXED WITH WRATHFUL INDIGNATION I ASK MYSELF WHAT IS IT FOR
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO UGLY
OR A FOXGLOVE HAPPILY THESE HAVE AS YET ESCAPED DWARFING THOUGH I REGRET TO SEE THAT A DEFORMITY THAT NOT UNFREQUENTLY APPEARS AMONG GARDEN FOXGLOVES LOOKING LIKE A BELL SHAPED FLOWER
MANY HAVE EXISTED FOR A GREAT NUMBER OF YEARS THEY ARE THE LOCAL SOURCES OF HORTICULTURAL EDUCATION TO WHICH LARGE CIRCLES OF PEOPLE NATURALLY LOOK FOR GUIDANCE AND THOUGH THEY PRODUCE AND ESPECIALLY THE ROSE SHOWS
IN A SMALL GARDEN OF A TYPE THAT I THOUGHT EXTREMELY DESIRABLE WITH A DOUBLE FLOWER OF JUST THE RIGHT DEGREE OF FULNESS AND OF AN UNUSUALLY FINE COLOUR I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET SOME SEED
AND NOT ONLY PASSIVELY OVERLOOKED BUT OVERTLY CONTEMNED THE SHOW PANSY JUDGE APPEARS TO HAVE NO EYE OR BRAIN OR HEART BUT TO HAVE IN THEIR PLACE A PAIR OF COMPASSES WITH WHICH TO DESCRIBE A CIRCLE
WHAT PROPORTION OF DEMAND THERE IS IN DAHLIAS FOR INSTANCE BETWEEN THE SHOW KINDS WHOSE AIM AND OBJECT IS THE SHOW TABLE AND THE DECORATIVE KINDS THAT ARE INDISPUTABLY BETTER FOR GARDEN USE LOOKING AT THE CATALOGUE
COMES ABOUT FROM THE GROWER LOSING SIGHT OF BEAUTY AS THE FIRST CONSIDERATION OR FROM HIS NOT HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE POINTS OF CHARACTER IN VARIOUS PLANTS MOST DESERVING OF DEVELOPMENT
BY AN EXAGGERATED AND SHOWY PICTORIAL REPRESENTATION THAT WILL SERVE NO USEFUL PURPOSE AND FOR WHICH THERE IS NO TRUE OR HEALTHY DEMAND NO DOUBT MUCH OF IT COMES ABOUT FROM THE UNWHOLESOME PRESSURE OF TRADE COMPETITION
WHAT A SILLY LITTLE DUMPY FORMLESS PINCUSHION OF A THING IT IS AND THEN THE DWARFEST OF THE CHINA ASTERS HERE IS A PLANT WHOSE CHIEF WEAKNESS ALREADY LIES IN A CERTAIN OVER STIFFNESS MADE STIFFER
THEY SAID THE WOLF KILLED A GREAT MANY OF THE BOY'S SHEEP AND THEN SLIPPED AWAY INTO THE FOREST LIARS ARE NOT BELIEVED EVEN WHEN THEY SPEAK THE TRUTH
AND MORE SHAPELESS STILL BY DWARFING AND BY CRAMMING WITH TOO MANY PETALS THE COMET ASTERS OF LATER YEARS ARE A MUCH IMPROVED TYPE OF FLOWER WITH A LOOSER SHAPE AND A CERTAIN DEGREE OF APPROACH TO GRACE AND BEAUTY
OR IN SOME SUCH WAY BETTER THAN AN OLDER THING OF THE SAME CLASS AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A GENERAL WISH AMONG SEED GROWERS JUST NOW TO DWARF ALL ANNUAL PLANTS
CAN IT BE REALLY TO TEACH WITH DELIBERATE INTENTION THAT INSTEAD OF DISPLAYING ITS NATURAL AND GRACEFUL TREE FORM IT SHOULD AIM AT A MORE DESIRABLE KIND OF BEAUTY SUCH AS THAT OF THE CHIMNEY POT OR DRAIN PIPE AND THAT THIS IS SO IMPORTANT
AND IN HER FRIGHT AND HASTE TO GET AWAY RAN ACROSS THE LION'S NOSE ROUSED FROM HIS NAP THE LION LAID HIS HUGE PAW ANGRILY ON THE TINY CREATURE TO KILL HER
THEY BECOME OF THE SAME NATURE AS ANY OTHER ARTICLE IN TRADE THAT IS GOT UP FOR SALE FOR THE SOLE BENEFIT OF THE SELLER THAT IS UNDULY LAUDED BY ADVERTISEMENT AND THAT MAKES ITS FIRST APPEAL TO THE VULGAR EYE
OF A LEADING DAHLIA NURSERY I FIND THAT THE DECORATIVE KINDS FILL TEN PAGES WHILE THE SHOW KINDS INCLUDING POMPONES FILL ONLY THREE
BUT WHICH IS NEVERTHELESS BEING PUSHED FORWARD IN TRADE IT HAS NO MERIT WHATEVER IN ITSELF AND IS ONLY LIKELY TO SELL BECAUSE IT IS NEW AND CURIOUS AND ALL THIS PARADE OF DISTORTION AND DEFORMITY
AND OF BRIGHTENING OUR HOMES AND EVEN GARDENS DURING THE DIM DAYS OF EARLY WINTER ARE TEASED AND TORTURED AND FATTED AND BLOATED INTO UGLY AND USELESS MONSTROSITIES FOR NO PURPOSE BUT TO GAIN MONEY
ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST INTERESTING AND ADMIRABLE OF GARDEN PLANTS
HE THOUGHT OF A PLAN TO AMUSE HIMSELF HIS MASTER HAD TOLD HIM TO CALL FOR HELP SHOULD A WOLF ATTACK THE FLOCK AND THE VILLAGERS WOULD DRIVE IT AWAY SO NOW
WHEN A ZINNIA HAS A HARD STIFF TALL FLOWER WITH A GREAT MANY ROWS OF PETALS PILED UP ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER AND WHEN ITS HABIT IS DWARFED TO A MEAN DEGREE OF SQUATNESS IT LOOKS TO ME BOTH UGLY AND ABSURD
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE NOVELTY AND VARIETY WHEN I LOOK BACK OVER THIRTY YEARS OF GARDENING I SEE WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS THERE HAS BEEN NOT ONLY IN THE INTRODUCTION OF GOOD PLANTS NEW TO GENERAL CULTIVATION
THE SERVANTS WENT OUT AND THE OTHERS WENT TO THEIR HIDING HOLES THE SERVANTS RUMMAGED WELL AND DID NOT FIND A THING
INDEED THAT GREAT RENASCENCE OF THE ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLES SHOULD AFTER ALL SO OVERWHELMINGLY OCCUR AS TO FORCE THIS EUROPEAN CITY TO BE TRI LINGUAL AND PREPARE THE WAY BY WHICH THE WHOLE WORLD MAY AT LAST SPEAK TOGETHER IN ONE TONGUE
THAT IS MARVELLOUS FOR ME SAID THE KING
YES INDEED CONALL YOU ARE WORDY AND WISE SAID THE KING I SEE THE FINGER IS OFF YOU YOU HAVE FREED YOUR TWO SONS
MOREOVER THE TECHNICALITIES OF THESE PEOPLES BEING NOT SO IMMEDIATELY AND CONSTANTLY BROUGHT INTO CONTRAST AND CONTACT WITH THEIR LATIN OR GREEK ROOTS AS THEY WOULD BE IF THEY WERE DERIVED AS ARE SO MANY PATRIOTIC GERMAN TECHNICALITIES
WHY SAID CONALL
STRONG ENOUGH TO BE VERY GRAVELY CONSIDERED IS THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT WRITING TAKING UP AN ORTHODOX ASSOCIATION OF SOUNDS AND BECOMING A WORLD SPEECH THE JAPANESE WRITTEN LANGUAGE THE LANGUAGE OF JAPANESE LITERATURE
BUT ECONOMICALLY IT MUST BECOME ONE IN THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS IT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE THE GREATEST URBAN REGION IN ALL THE WORLD EXCEPT THAT WHICH WILL ARISE IN THE EASTERN STATES OF NORTH AMERICA AND THAT WHICH MAY ARISE SOMEWHERE ABOUT HANKOW
TELL ME ANY CASE IN WHICH YOU WERE AS HARD AS THIS AND IF YOU TELL THAT YOU SHALL GET THE SOUL OF YOUR YOUNGEST SON I WILL TELL A CASE AS HARD IN WHICH I WAS SAID CONALL I WAS ONCE A YOUNG LAD AND MY FATHER HAD MUCH LAND
BE THIS FROM ME SAID THE ONE EYED ONE
AND MANY PRECIOUS THINGS WITHIN HER
AND HE FELL COLD DEAD WHERE HE WAS AND YOU MAY BE SURE O KING THAT JOY WAS ON ME
AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT MIGHT BE THE PREVALENT AND EVERYDAY LANGUAGE OF SCANDINAVIA AND DENMARK AND HOLLAND OF ALL AFRICA ALL NORTH AMERICA OF THE PACIFIC COASTS OF ASIA AND OF INDIA THE UNIVERSAL INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE
OR ELSE NO MORE OF MY WORLD WILL BE BEFORE ME JUST THEN WE COULD BE HEARING THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE GIANT WHAT SHALL I DO WHAT SHALL I DO CRIED THE WOMAN I WENT TO THE CALDRON AND BY LUCK IT WAS NOT HOT SO IN IT I GOT JUST AS THE BRUTE CAME IN
AND MY HANDS IN PLACE OF HIS FORELEGS AND MY HEAD IN PLACE OF HIS HEAD AND THE HORNS ON TOP OF MY HEAD SO THAT THE BRUTE MIGHT THINK THAT IT WAS THE BUCK I WENT OUT WHEN I WAS GOING OUT THE GIANT LAID HIS HAND ON ME AND HE SAID
BUT HERE IT IS CLEAR THAT UPON THE PROBABILITY OF SUCH A RENASCENCE DEPENDS THE EXTENSION OF THE LANGUAGE AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE PRESERVATION OF THAT MILITARY AND NAVAL EFFICIENCY UPON WHICH IN THIS WORLD OF RESOLUTE AGGRESSION THE EXISTENCE OF THE ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES FINALLY DEPENDS
YOU SAW HIM NOT WITH YOUR TWO EYES AND THOUGH I HAVE BUT ONE EYE THERE'S THE RASCAL UP IN THE TREE WHEN HE HAD SAID THAT
HAST THOU BOILED THAT YOUNGSTER FOR ME HE CRIED HE'S NOT DONE YET SAID SHE AND I CRIED OUT FROM THE CALDRON MAMMY MAMMY IT'S BOILING I AM
TO GROSSLY UNDERVALUE THE PROSPECTS OF ALL THINGS FRENCH DERIVED SO FAR AS I CAN GATHER FROM THE FACTS THAT THE FRENCH WERE BEATEN BY THE GERMANS IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY AND THAT THEY DO NOT BREED WITH THE ABANDON OF RABBITS OR NEGROES THESE ARE CONSIDERATIONS THAT AFFECT THE DISSEMINATION OF FRENCH VERY LITTLE
THE KING HEARD THE NOISE IT MUST BE MY BROWN HORSE SAID HE TO HIS GILLIES FIND OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM THE SERVANTS WENT OUT AND WHEN CONALL AND HIS SONS SAW THEM COMING THEY WENT INTO THE HIDING HOLES
CONALL AND HIS SONS LAID THEIR HANDS AGAIN ON THE HORSE IF THE NOISE WAS GREAT THAT HE MADE BEFORE THE NOISE THAT HE MADE NOW WAS SEVEN TIMES GREATER THE KING SENT A MESSAGE FOR HIS GILLIES AGAIN AND SAID FOR CERTAIN THERE WAS SOMETHING TROUBLING THE BROWN HORSE GO AND LOOK WELL ABOUT HIM
SAID SHE WHY DIDST NOT THOU LET THE KING DO HIS OWN PLEASURE TO THY SONS RATHER THAN BE GOING NOW WHILE I KNOW NOT IF EVER I SHALL SEE THEE MORE WHEN HE ROSE ON THE MORROW HE SET HIMSELF AND HIS THREE SONS IN ORDER AND THEY TOOK THEIR JOURNEY TOWARDS LOCHLANN
IT MUST BE THAT SOME ONE IS TROUBLING MY BROWN HORSE HE SOUNDED THE BELL HASTILY AND WHEN HIS WAITING MAN CAME TO HIM HE SAID TO HIM TO LET THE STABLE GILLIES KNOW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE HORSE THE GILLIES CAME AND THE KING WENT WITH THEM
WITH ITS GAUDY REACH ME DOWNS OF GILDED AND EMBOSSED COVER ITS HORRIBLY PRINTED NOVELS
WITHOUT QUESTION AND NECESSITY MADE ME COME I AM UNDER THY PARDON AND UNDER THINE HONOUR AND UNDER THY GRACE HE TOLD HOW IT HAPPENED TO HIM AND THAT HE HAD TO GET THE BROWN HORSE FOR THE KING OF ERIN OR THAT HIS SONS WERE TO BE PUT TO DEATH
AND THEY MADE NO STOP BUT TORE THROUGH OCEAN TILL THEY REACHED IT WHEN THEY REACHED LOCHLANN THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD DO SAID THE OLD MAN TO HIS SONS
CONCEIVABLY IF IN THE COMING YEARS A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT WERE MADE TO PROVIDE SOUND INSTRUCTION IN ENGLISH TO ALL WHO SOUGHT IT AND TO ALL WITHIN THE CONTROL OF ENGLISH SPEAKING GOVERNMENTS IF HONOUR AND EMOLUMENT WERE GIVEN TO LITERARY MEN INSTEAD OF BEING LEFT TO THEM TO MOST INDELICATELY TAKE
THE INDIGENOUS GERMAN TECHNICALITY REMAINS CLUMSY AND COMPROMISED BY ITS EVERYDAY RELATIONS TO THE END OF TIME IT DRAGS A LENGTHENING CHAIN OF UNSUITABLE ASSOCIATIONS AND THE SHADE OF MEANING
FRENCH ATTACKS GERMAN IN THE FLANK AND HAS AS CLEAR A PROSPECT OF PREDOMINANCE THESE TWO TONGUES MUST INEVITABLY COME INTO KEEN CONFLICT
AND IT IS FREQUENTLY EASIER FOR AN ENGLISHMAN WITH SOME SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF HIS SUBJECT TO READ AND APPRECIATE A SUBTLE AND TECHNICAL WORK IN FRENCH THAN IT IS FOR HIM TO FULLY ENTER INTO THE POPULAR MATTER OF THE SAME TONGUE
AND IT WILL DO THEE GOOD I WILL NOT TAKE THE RING FROM YOU SAID I BUT THROW IT AND I WILL TAKE IT WITH ME HE THREW THE RING ON THE FLAT GROUND I WENT MYSELF AND LIFTED THE RING AND I PUT IT ON MY FINGER WHEN HE SAID TO ME THEN IS THE RING FITTING THEE
SAID THE HEAD BARD NOW O CONALL PAY THE REWARD OF THE CRONAN THAT THE CATS HAVE SUNG TO THEE WELL THEN SAID I MYSELF I HAVE NO REWARD WHATSOEVER FOR YOU UNLESS YOU SHOULD GO DOWN AND TAKE THAT CALF
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT I WAS NEAR MY FOE AND FAR FROM MY FRIENDS AND I CALLED TO THE WOMAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AND SHE SAID TO ME WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE I TOLD HER MYSELF WORD UPON WORD HOW I CAME WELL THEN SAID SHE
THROUGHOUT EASTERN ASIA THERE IS STILL NO DOUBT A VAST WILDERNESS OF LANGUAGES BUT OVER THEM ALL RIDES THE CHINESE WRITING AND VERY STRONG
THERE THOU ART THOU PRETTY BUCK THOU SEEST ME BUT I SEE THEE NOT WHEN I MYSELF GOT OUT AND I SAW THE WORLD ABOUT ME SURELY O KING JOY WAS ON ME WHEN I WAS OUT AND HAD SHAKEN THE SKIN OFF ME I SAID TO THE BRUTE
HARD IS THE MATTER YOU REQUIRE OF ME BUT I WILL LOSE MY OWN LIFE AND THE LIFE OF MY SONS OR ELSE I WILL DO THE PLEASURE OF THE KING AFTER THESE WORDS CONALL LEFT THE KING AND HE WENT HOME WHEN HE GOT HOME HE WAS UNDER MUCH TROUBLE AND PERPLEXITY
BUT WHEN ONE TURNS TO CHINA THERE ARE THE STRANGEST POSSIBILITIES
THEY ARE I BELIEVE ALREADY JUDGED BY A D TWO THOUSAND ALL THESE LANGUAGES WILL BE TENDING MORE AND MORE TO BE THE SECOND TONGUES OF BI LINGUAL COMMUNITIES WITH FRENCH OR ENGLISH OR LESS PROBABLY GERMAN WINNING THE UPPER HAND
I HEARD A GREAT CLATTERING COMING AND WHAT WAS THERE BUT A GREAT GIANT AND TWO DOZEN OF GOATS WITH HIM AND A BUCK AT THEIR HEAD AND WHEN THE GIANT HAD TIED THE GOATS HE CAME UP AND HE SAID TO ME HAO O
HONESTLY SORRY THE THING IS A BOOK BUT WHO HAS DONE HIS BEST TO REMEDY IT ANYHOW AND ALL THE ENGLISH SHOPFUL IS EITHER BRAND NEW FICTION OR ILLUSTRATED TRAVEL OF BUNS WITH THE GRAND LAMA TYPE
ITS WESTWARD PORT MAY BE BORDEAUX OR MILFORD HAVEN OR EVEN SOME PORT IN THE SOUTH WEST OF IRELAND UNLESS WHICH IS VERY UNLIKELY THE VELOCITY OF SECURE SEA TRAVEL CAN BE INCREASED BEYOND THAT OF LAND LOCOMOTION
WHEN THEY WENT TO THE HOUSE OF THE KING'S MILLER THE MAN ASKED THEM TO STOP THERE FOR THE NIGHT CONALL TOLD THE MILLER THAT HIS OWN CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN OF HIS KING HAD FALLEN OUT AND THAT HIS CHILDREN HAD KILLED THE KING'S SON AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WOULD PLEASE THE KING
I MAY BE THE SLAVE OF PERSPECTIVE EFFECTS BUT WHEN I TURN MY MIND FROM THE PETTIFOGGING MUDDLE OF THE ENGLISH HOUSE OF COMMONS FOR EXAMPLE THAT MAGNIFIED VESTRY THAT IS SO PROUD OF ITSELF AS A CLUB WHEN I TURN FROM THAT TO THIS RACE OF BRAVE AND SMILING PEOPLE
THIS GREAT CITY REGION WILL REMAIN I BELIEVE IN ITS PRESENT POSITION AT THE SEAPORT END OF THE GREAT PLAIN OF THE OLD WORLD CONSIDERATIONS OF TRANSIT WILL KEEP IT WHERE IT HAS GROWN AND ELECTRICITY WILL BE BROUGHT TO IT IN MIGHTY CABLES FROM THE TORRENTS OF THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN MOUNTAIN MASS
THE THING IS SILLY THAT YOU ARE COME TO SEEK SAID THE MILLER FOR THE KING HAS LAID HIS MIND ON HIM SO GREATLY THAT YOU WILL NOT GET HIM IN ANY WAY UNLESS YOU STEAL HIM BUT IF YOU CAN MAKE OUT A WAY I WILL KEEP IT SECRET THIS IS WHAT I AM THINKING SAID CONALL
WHEN I WAS LOOKING WHAT SHOULD I DO BUT FALL AND THE PLACE WAS SO FULL OF HEATHER THAT NEITHER BONE NOR SKIN WAS BROKEN I KNEW NOT HOW I SHOULD GET OUT OF THIS
IT WILL STRETCH A SPIDER'S WEB OF RAILWAYS AND GREAT ROADS OF THE NEW SORT OVER THE WHOLE CONTINENT EVEN WHEN THE COAL FIELD INDUSTRIES OF THE PLAIN GIVE PLACE TO THE INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION OF MOUNTAIN BORN ELECTRICITY
THE SERRIED RANKS OF LEMON COLOURED VOLUMES IN THE FORMER HAVE THE WHOLE RANGE OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND INTEREST THERE ARE NO TABOOS AND NO LIMITS YOU HAVE EVERYTHING UP AND DOWN THE SCALE FROM FRANK INDECENCY TO STARK WISDOM IT IS A SHOP FOR MEN
THE FRENCH READING PUBLIC IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND VERY MUCH LARGER THAN THE EXISTING FRENCH POLITICAL SYSTEM THE NUMBER OF BOOKS PUBLISHED IN FRENCH IS GREATER THAN THAT PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH
WHEN CONALL AND HIS SONS PERCEIVED THAT THE GILLIES WERE GONE THEY LAID HANDS AGAIN ON THE HORSE AND ONE OF THEM CAUGHT HIM AND IF THE NOISE THAT THE HORSE MADE ON THE TWO FORMER TIMES WAS GREAT HE MADE MORE THIS TIME BE THIS FROM ME SAID THE KING
THE SERVANTS LOCKED THE DOOR AND THEY WENT AWAY WHEN THEY ROSE TO LAY HAND ON THE BROWN HORSE SAID CONALL YOU SHALL NOT DO THAT IT IS HARD TO GET OUT OF THIS LET US MAKE FOR OURSELVES FOUR HIDING HOLES
WHEN CONALL AND HIS SONS PERCEIVED THE COMPANY COMING THEY WENT TO THE HIDING HOLES THE KING WAS A WARY MAN AND HE SAW WHERE THE HORSES WERE MAKING A NOISE BE WARY SAID THE KING THERE ARE MEN WITHIN THE STABLE LET US GET AT THEM SOMEHOW
THE LIMITED QUALIFICATION THAT A FRENCHMAN OR ENGLISHMAN CAN ATTAIN WITH A MERE TWIST OF THE SENTENCE THE GERMAN MUST EITHER ABANDON OR LABORIOUSLY OVERSTATE WITH SOME COLOSSAL WORMCAST OF PARENTHESIS
AND I MYSELF GAVE THE NEXT SHOUT AND IN VERY DEED IT WAS NOT A WEAK ONE CERTAINLY SAID THE PRIEST IT IS A MAN IN EXTREMITY LET US MOVE
AND HE HAD PARKS OF YEAR OLD COWS AND ONE OF THEM HAD JUST CALVED AND MY FATHER TOLD ME TO BRING HER HOME I FOUND THE COW AND TOOK HER WITH US THERE FELL A SHOWER OF SNOW WE WENT INTO THE HERD'S BOTHY
TILL THE CATS RAN AWAY AND SURELY O KING I DID NOT MOVE TILL I SAW THE LAST ONE OF THEM OFF AND THEN I CAME HOME
IT WAS SO I CAME ALSO SHE SHOWED ME TO THE PLACE WHERE I SHOULD COME IN WHERE SHE WAS I WENT IN AND I SAID TO HER WHAT WAS THE MATTER THAT YOU WERE PUTTING THE KNIFE ON THE NECK OF THE CHILD IT IS THAT HE MUST BE COOKED FOR THE GIANT WHO IS HERE
PROBABLY AS UNINTERESTING TO A FOREIGNER AS POPULAR ENGLISH AND AMERICAN ROMANCE AND GERMAN COMPARED WITH FRENCH IS AN UNATTRACTIVE LANGUAGE UNMELODIOUS UNWIELDY
BUT I SEE THAT THOUGH I FOLLOW YOU REVENGEFULLY I SHALL NOT BE MUCH BETTER FOR IT AND I WILL NOW SET A THING BEFORE YOU AND IF YOU WILL DO IT I WILL NOT FOLLOW YOU WITH REVENGE
THERE IS A SHOUT OF A MAN IN EXTREMITY AND I MUST NOT BE WITHOUT REPLYING TO IT AND THE WISEST OF THE MEN SAID LET IT ALONE TILL WE HEAR IT AGAIN THE CATS BEGAN AGAIN DIGGING WILDLY
I SAID TO HIM IT IS THEN HE SAID WHERE ART THOU RING AND THE RING SAID I AM HERE THE BRUTE WENT AND WENT TOWARDS WHERE THE RING WAS SPEAKING AND NOW I SAW THAT I WAS IN A HARDER CASE THAN EVER I WAS I DREW A DIRK I CUT THE FINGER FROM OFF ME
I WENT AND GOT THE BOAT WITH WHICH I CAME AND SHE WAS NO WAY LIGHTENED AND TOOK THE WOMAN AND THE CHILD OVER ON DRY LAND AND I RETURNED HOME
THEY MADE THE HOLES THEN THEY LAID HANDS ON THE HORSE
THESE ARE THE AGGREGATING TONGUES I DO NOT THINK THAT ANY OTHER TONGUES THAN THESE ARE QUITE LIKELY TO HOLD THEIR OWN IN THE COMING TIME ITALIAN MAY FLOURISH IN THE CITY OF THE PO VALLEY BUT ONLY WITH FRENCH BESIDE IT
IT IS IN EASTERN ASIA ALONE THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE ANY POSSIBILITY OF A SYNTHESIS SUFFICIENTLY GREAT TO MAINTAIN ITSELF ARISING OUTSIDE OF AND INDEPENDENTLY OF THE INTERLOCKED SYSTEM OF MECHANICALLY SUSTAINED SOCIETIES THAT IS DEVELOPING OUT OF MEDIAEVAL CHRISTENDOM
THE CATS BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR ME THROUGH THE WOOD AND THEY COULD NOT FIND ME AND WHEN THEY WERE TIRED EACH ONE SAID TO THE OTHER THAT THEY WOULD TURN BACK BUT SAID THE ONE EYED FOX COLOURED CAT THAT WAS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OVER THEM
HE GAVE A SPRING AFTER THE RING AND OUT HE WENT IN THE SEA AND I WAS AS PLEASED THEN WHEN I SAW HIM DROWNING
I TOOK MYSELF OFF AS HARD AS I MIGHT INTO THE WOOD I WAS SWIFT ENOUGH AND STRONG AT THAT TIME AND WHEN I FELT THE RUSTLING TOIRM OF THE CATS AFTER ME I CLIMBED INTO AS HIGH A TREE AS I SAW IN THE PLACE AND ONE THAT WAS CLOSE IN THE TOP AND I HID MYSELF AS WELL AS I MIGHT
BUT I SEE THEE NOT I KEPT LETTING THEM OUT BY THE WAY OF ONE AND ONE AS I FLAYED THE BUCK AND BEFORE THE LAST ONE WAS OUT I HAD HIM FLAYED BAG WISE THEN I WENT AND I PUT MY LEGS IN PLACE OF HIS LEGS
TENDS TO ASSIMILATE ITSELF TO CHINESE AND FRESH CHINESE WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS ARE CONTINUALLY TAKING ROOT IN JAPAN
I KNEW THAT I SHOULD NOT GET HIM BY ASKING AND I WAS GOING TO STEAL HIM YES CONALL IT IS WELL ENOUGH BUT COME IN SAID THE KING HE DESIRED HIS LOOK OUT MEN TO SET A WATCH ON THE SONS OF CONALL AND TO GIVE THEM MEAT AND A DOUBLE WATCH WAS SET THAT NIGHT ON THE SONS OF CONALL
I LEFT THE SKIN OF MY HIPS BEHIND ME BUT I CAME OUT WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CALDRON I KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO AND SHE SAID TO ME THAT THERE WAS NO WEAPON THAT WOULD KILL HIM BUT HIS OWN WEAPON I BEGAN TO DRAW HIS SPEAR
GO UP AND SING A CRONAN TO CONALL YELLOWCLAW SAID THE HEAD BARD AND SURELY O KING I HAD NO CARE FOR THEM OR FOR THEIR CRONAN FOR I BEGAN TO SEE THAT THEY WERE NOT GOOD COMRADES
AS FORTUNE FAVOURED ME THE BRUTE SLEPT BESIDE THE CALDRON THERE I WAS SCALDED BY THE BOTTOM OF THE CALDRON WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS ASLEEP SHE SET HER MOUTH QUIETLY TO THE HOLE THAT WAS IN THE LID AND SHE SAID TO ME WAS I ALIVE I SAID I WAS
AND IF THE PRESENT SORDID TRADE OF PUBLISHING WERE SO LIFTED AS TO BRING THE WHOLE LITERATURE THE WHOLE SCIENCE AND ALL THE CONTEMPORARY THOUGHT OF THE WORLD NOT SOME SELECTION OF THE WORLD'S LITERATURE NOT SOME OBSOLETE ENCYCLOPAEDIA SOLD MEANLY AND BASELY TO CHOKE HUNGRY MINDS
I WAS THEN SAID CONALL QUITE A YOUNG LAD AND I WENT OUT HUNTING AND MY FATHER'S LAND WAS BESIDE THE SEA AND IT WAS ROUGH WITH ROCKS CAVES AND RIFTS
THE SERVANTS LOOKED AMONGST THE HORSES AND THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND THEY RETURNED AND THEY TOLD THIS TO THE KING AND THE KING SAID TO THEM THAT IF NOTHING WAS WRONG THEY SHOULD GO TO THEIR PLACES OF REST WHEN THE GILLIES HAD TIME TO BE GONE
I DO NOT SEE HOW THIS GREAT REGION IS TO UNIFY ITSELF WITHOUT SOME LINGUISTIC COMPROMISE THE GERMANIZATION OF THE FRENCH SPEAKING PEOPLES BY FORCE IS TOO RIDICULOUS A SUGGESTION TO ENTERTAIN ALMOST INEVITABLY WITH TRAVEL
OCH CONALL SAID THE KING YOU ARE FULL OF WORDS YOU HAVE FREED THE SOUL OF YOUR SON WITH YOUR TALE AND IF YOU TELL ME A HARDER CASE THAN THAT YOU WILL GET YOUR SECOND YOUNGEST SON AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE TWO SONS
AND THE FRENCH TRANSLATORS ARE THE MOST ALERT AND EFFICIENT IN THE WORLD ONE HAS ONLY TO SEE A PARISIAN BOOKSHOP AND TO RECALL AN ENGLISH ONE TO REALIZE THE AS YET UNATTAINABLE STANDING OF FRENCH
WITH TRANSPORT COMMUNICATIONS WITH EVERY CONDITION OF HUMAN CONVENIENCE INSISTING UPON IT FORMALLY OR INFORMALLY A BI LINGUAL COMPROMISE WILL COME INTO OPERATION AND TO MY MIND AT LEAST THE CHANCES SEEM EVEN THAT FRENCH WILL EMERGE ON THE UPPER HAND UNLESS
ABRUPTLY DESTINY BEGINS DRAWING WITH A BOLDER HAND SUPPOSE THE JAPANESE WERE TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS TO ACCELERATE WHATEVER PROCESS OF SYNTHESIS WERE POSSIBLE IN CHINA
OR GILDED VERSIONS OF THE CLASSICS OF PAST TIMES DONE UP TO GIVE AWAY WHILE THE FRENCH BOOKSHOP REEKS OF CONTEMPORARY INTELLECTUAL LIFE THESE THINGS COUNT FOR FRENCH AS AGAINST ENGLISH NOW AND THEY WILL COUNT FOR INFINITELY MORE IN THE COMING YEARS
AND WE TOOK THE COW AND THE CALF IN WITH US AND WE WERE LETTING THE SHOWER PASS FROM US WHO SHOULD COME IN BUT ONE CAT AND TEN AND ONE GREAT ONE EYED FOX COLOURED CAT AS HEAD BARD OVER THEM
NOW O CONALL SAID THE KING WERE YOU EVER IN A HARDER PLACE THAN TO BE SEEING YOUR LOT OF SONS HANGED TO MORROW BUT YOU SET IT TO MY GOODNESS AND TO MY GRACE AND SAY THAT IT WAS NECESSITY BROUGHT IT ON YOU SO I MUST NOT HANG YOU
PAY NOW THEIR REWARD SAID THE HEAD BARD AND FOR SURE O KING I HAD NO REWARD FOR THEM AND I SAID TO THEM I HAVE NO REWARD FOR YOU AND SURELY O KING THERE WAS A CATTERWAULING BETWEEN THEM SO I LEAPT OUT AT A TURF WINDOW THAT WAS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE
FROM NATIVE ROOTS ARE FREE TO QUALIFY AND DEVELOP A FINAL MEANING DISTINCT FROM THEIR ORIGINAL INTENTION IN THE GROWING AND CHANGING BODY OF SCIENCE THIS COUNTS FOR MUCH
PLAY UP WITH YOU WHY SHOULD YOU BE SILENT MAKE A CRONAN TO CONALL YELLOWCLAW SAID THE HEAD BARD I HAD NO LIKING AT ALL FOR THE CRONAN BUT UP CAME THE ONE CAT AND TEN AND IF THEY DID NOT SING ME A CRONAN THEN AND THERE
MOREOVER AGAINST THE GERMAN TONGUE THERE ARE HOSTILE FRONTIERS THERE ARE HOSTILE PEOPLE WHO FEAR GERMAN PREPONDERANCE AND WHO HAVE SET THEIR HEARTS AGAINST ITS USE IN ROUMANIA AND AMONG THE SLAV BOHEMIAN AND HUNGARIAN PEOPLES
I WAS NOT LOOKING BEFORE ME BUT I KEPT LOOKING OVERHEAD THE WAY I CAME AND THINKING THAT THE DAY WOULD NEVER COME THAT I COULD GET UP THERE IT WAS TERRIBLE FOR ME TO BE THERE TILL I SHOULD DIE
I SAW IN IT AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLLOW A WOMAN WITH A CHILD AND THE CHILD WAS NAKED ON HER KNEE AND SHE HAD A KNIFE IN HER HAND SHE TRIED TO PUT THE KNIFE TO THE THROAT OF THE BABE AND THE BABE BEGAN TO LAUGH IN HER FACE AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SHE THREW THE KNIFE BEHIND HER
IT WILL STRETCH FROM LILLE TO KIEL IT WILL DRIVE EXTENSIONS ALONG THE RHINE VALLEY INTO SWITZERLAND AND FLING AN ARM ALONG THE MOLDAU TO PRAGUE IT WILL BE THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL OF THE OLD WORLD
AND CHECKED THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW WORDS OF CLASSICAL ORIGIN IN PARTICULAR IT HAS STOOD IN THE WAY OF THE INTERNATIONAL USE OF SCIENTIFIC TERMS THE ENGLISHMAN THE FRENCHMAN AND THE ITALIAN HAVE A CERTAIN COMMUNITY OF TECHNICAL SCIENTIFIC AND PHILOSOPHICAL PHRASEOLOGY
THAT THEY THEMSELVES AND THE CHILDREN OF CONALL CAME TO BLOWS THE CHILDREN OF CONALL GOT THE UPPER HAND AND THEY KILLED THE KING'S BIG SON THE KING SENT A MESSAGE FOR CONALL AND HE SAID TO HIM
I AM OUT NOW IN SPITE OF YOU AHA SAID HE HAST THOU DONE THIS TO ME
AND CURSED WITH A HIDEOUS AND BLINDING LETTERING THAT THE GERMAN IS TOO PATRIOTIC TO SACRIFICE THERE HAS BEEN IN GERMANY A MORE POWERFUL PARALLEL TO WHAT ONE MAY CALL THE HONEST SAXON MOVEMENT AMONG THE ENGLISH
BUT WITH EVERY ILL THAT BEFELL ME I GOT THE SPEAR LOOSED FROM HIM
I AM NOT SAID I BUT THE ROPES ARE SO TIGHT THAT I TAKE LONG TO LOOSE THEM
THEY WILL PERHAPS FIGHT THEIR BATTLE FOR THE LINGUISTIC CONQUEST OF EUROPE AND PERHAPS OF THE WORLD IN A GREAT URBAN REGION THAT WILL ARISE ABOUT THE RHINE POLITICALLY THIS REGION LIES NOW IN SIX INDEPENDENT STATES
THEN WENT MY FATHER SAID CONALL AND HE GOT ME A WIFE AND I WAS MARRIED I WENT TO HUNT
PAY THEM NOW THEIR REWARD SAID THE GREAT FOX COLOURED CAT I AM TIRED MYSELF OF YOURSELVES AND YOUR REWARDS SAID I I HAVE NO REWARD FOR YOU UNLESS YOU TAKE THAT COW DOWN THERE THEY BETOOK THEMSELVES TO THE COW AND INDEED
THAT QUEER MENTAL TWIST THAT MOVES MEN TO CALL AN OTHERWISE UNDISTINGUISHED PREFACE A FOREWORD AND FIND A PLEASURABLE ADVANTAGE OVER THEIR FELLOW CREATURES IN A FAMILIARITY WITH EFTSOONS THIS TENDENCY IN GERMAN HAS DONE MUCH TO ARREST THE SIMPLIFICATION OF IDIOM
AND THE CATS AROSE ON THE TREE AND THEY BROKE THE THIRD ROOT AND THE TREE FELL ON HER ELBOW THEN I GAVE THE THIRD SHOUT THE STALWART MEN HASTENED AND WHEN THEY SAW HOW THE CATS SERVED THE TREE THEY BEGAN AT THEM WITH THE SPADES AND THEY THEMSELVES AND THE CATS BEGAN AT EACH OTHER
WHEN THEY CAME IN IN VERY DEED I MYSELF HAD NO LIKING FOR THEIR COMPANY STRIKE UP WITH YOU SAID THE HEAD BARD WHY SHOULD WE BE STILL AND SING A CRONAN TO CONALL YELLOWCLAW
FRENCH AND GERMAN WILL CERTAINLY BE AGGREGATING LANGUAGES DURING THE GREATER PORTION OF THE COMING YEARS OF THE TWO I AM INCLINED TO THINK FRENCH WILL SPREAD FURTHER THAN GERMAN THERE IS A DISPOSITION IN THE WORLD WHICH THE FRENCH SHARE
BUT THAT HE SHOULD GET THE BROWN HORSE OF THE KING OF LOCHLANN
AND I THREW IT FROM ME AS FAR AS I COULD OUT ON THE LOCH AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEPTH IN THE PLACE HE SHOUTED WHERE ART THOU RING AND THE RING SAID I AM HERE
AND OVER GERMAN ALSO FRENCH HAS MANY ADVANTAGES IN SPITE OF THE NUMERICAL PREPONDERANCE OF BOOKS PUBLISHED IN GERMANY IT IS DOUBTFUL IF THE GERMAN READER HAS QUITE SUCH A CATHOLIC FEAST BEFORE HIM AS THE READER OF FRENCH THERE IS A MASS OF GERMAN FICTION
OCH SAID I IT'S NOT MUCH YOU WILL BE BETTERED BY ME THOUGH YOU SHOULD TEAR ME ASUNDER I WILL MAKE BUT ONE MEAL FOR YOU BUT I SEE THAT YOU ARE ONE EYED I AM A GOOD LEECH AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE SIGHT OF THE OTHER EYE
AND IT WAS NOT AGREEABLE FOR THE LIKE OF ME TO ATTACK HIM
CONALL YELLOWCLAW WAS A STURDY TENANT IN ERIN HE HAD THREE SONS THERE WAS AT THAT TIME A KING OVER EVERY FIFTH OF ERIN
THE KING FOLLOWED THE TRACKS OF THE MEN AND HE FOUND THEM EVERY ONE KNEW CONALL FOR HE WAS A VALUED TENANT OF THE KING OF ERIN AND WHEN THE KING BROUGHT THEM UP OUT OF THE HOLES HE SAID O CONALL IS IT YOU THAT ARE HERE I AM O KING
WHEN I WENT OUT OF THE BOAT THE BOAT RETURNED WHERE SHE WAS BEFORE I DID NOT KNOW NOW WHAT I SHOULD DO THE PLACE WAS WITHOUT MEAT OR CLOTHING WITHOUT THE APPEARANCE OF A HOUSE ON IT I CAME OUT ON THE TOP OF A HILL THEN I CAME TO A GLEN
WELL THEN SAID CONALL ON CONDITION THAT THOU DOST THAT I WILL TELL THEE HOW I WAS ONCE IN A HARDER CASE THAN TO BE IN THY POWER IN PRISON TO NIGHT LET'S HEAR SAID THE KING
WHEN THE GIANT WAS DROWNED I WENT IN AND I TOOK WITH ME ALL HE HAD OF GOLD AND SILVER AND I WENT HOME AND SURELY GREAT JOY WAS ON MY PEOPLE WHEN I ARRIVED AND AS A SIGN NOW LOOK THE FINGER IS OFF ME
THE GIANT WENT AND HE DREW THE GREAT CALDRON ON THE SITE OF THE FIRE I MYSELF WAS TELLING HIM HOW HE SHOULD HEAT THE WATER
SINCE YOU ARE WORKING EVERY DAY FOR THE KING YOU AND YOUR GILLIES COULD PUT MYSELF AND MY SONS INTO FOUR SACKS OF BRAN THE PLAN THAT HAS COME INTO YOUR HEAD IS NOT BAD SAID THE MILLER
BUT A REAL PUBLICATION OF ALL THAT HAS BEEN AND IS BEING DONE WITHIN THE REACH OF EACH MAN'S NEED AND DESIRE WHO HAD THE FRANCHISE OF THE TONGUE
WHEN HE WENT TO LIE DOWN HE TOLD HIS WIFE THE THING THE KING HAD SET BEFORE HIM HIS WIFE TOOK MUCH SORROW THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO PART FROM HERSELF WHILE SHE KNEW NOT IF SHE SHOULD SEE HIM MORE O CONALL
AND IN A FAIR WAY TO BE THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF MANKIND BUT SUCH AN ENTERPRISE DEMANDS A RESOLVE AND INTELLIGENCE BEYOND ALL THE IMMEDIATE SIGNS OF THE TIMES IT IMPLIES A VERITABLE RENASCENCE OF INTELLECTUAL LIFE AMONG THE ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLES
THE JAPANESE ARE A PEOPLE QUITE ABNORMAL AND INCALCULABLE WITH A TOUCH OF ROMANCE A CONCEPTION OF HONOUR A QUALITY OF IMAGINATION AND A CLEARNESS OF INTELLIGENCE THAT RENDERS POSSIBLE FOR THEM THINGS INCONCEIVABLE OF ANY OTHER EXISTING NATION
WHO WAS ALLOWED TO VISIT HER FATHER AND WHO BY HER GESTURES EXPRESSED HER LIVELY GRATITUDE
SUCH WERE THE EVENTS THAT PREYED ON THE HEART OF FELIX AND RENDERED HIM WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM THE MOST MISERABLE OF HIS FAMILY HE COULD HAVE ENDURED POVERTY AND WHILE THIS DISTRESS HAD BEEN THE MEED OF HIS VIRTUE HE GLORIED IN IT
BY PROMISES OF REWARD AND WEALTH FELIX REJECTED HIS OFFERS WITH CONTEMPT
SEIZED AND MADE A SLAVE BY THE TURKS
MAKE ME HAPPY LET ME FEEL GRATITUDE TOWARDS YOU FOR ONE BENEFIT LET ME SEE THAT I EXCITE THE SYMPATHY OF SOME EXISTING THING DO NOT DENY ME MY REQUEST I WAS MOVED
AND WITHOUT THE PLANS OF THE WORLD COUNCIL THE SUN CANNOT RISE IT TOOK FIFTY YEARS TO SECURE THE APPROVAL OF ALL THE COUNCILS FOR THE CANDLE AND TO DECIDE UPON THE NUMBER NEEDED
MUST BE MY PORTION THE LOVE OF ANOTHER WILL DESTROY THE CAUSE OF MY CRIMES AND I SHALL BECOME A THING OF WHOSE EXISTENCE EVERYONE WILL BE IGNORANT
AM I NOT SHUNNED AND HATED BY ALL MANKIND YOU MY CREATOR WOULD TEAR ME TO PIECES AND TRIUMPH REMEMBER THAT AND TELL ME WHY I SHOULD PITY MAN MORE THAN HE PITIES ME
TO FLY FROM THE HABITATIONS OF MAN TO DWELL IN THOSE WILDS WHERE THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD WILL BE YOUR ONLY COMPANIONS HOW CAN YOU WHO LONG FOR THE LOVE AND SYMPATHY OF MAN PERSEVERE IN THIS EXILE
WHO EXHIBITED TOWARDS HIM THE SIMPLEST AND TENDEREST AFFECTION THEY CONVERSED WITH ONE ANOTHER THROUGH THE MEANS OF AN INTERPRETER AND SOMETIMES WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF LOOKS
AND WE STOOD STILL OUR EYES UPON THE WIRE AND SLOWLY SLOWLY AS A FLUSH OF BLOOD A RED FLAME TREMBLED IN THE WIRE THEN THE WIRE GLOWED BUT TERROR STRUCK THE MEN OF THE COUNCIL
YOU WILL RETURN AND AGAIN SEEK THEIR KINDNESS AND YOU WILL MEET WITH THEIR DETESTATION YOUR EVIL PASSIONS WILL BE RENEWED AND YOU WILL THEN HAVE A COMPANION TO AID YOU IN THE TASK OF DESTRUCTION THIS MAY NOT BE CEASE TO ARGUE THE POINT FOR I CANNOT CONSENT
AND TAUGHT HER TO ASPIRE TO HIGHER POWERS OF INTELLECT AND AN INDEPENDENCE OF SPIRIT FORBIDDEN TO THE FEMALE FOLLOWERS OF MUHAMMAD THIS LADY DIED BUT HER LESSONS WERE INDELIBLY IMPRESSED ON THE MIND OF SAFIE WHO SICKENED AT THE PROSPECT OF AGAIN RETURNING TO ASIA
AND ITS TRUTH ABOVE THEIR TRUTH WHY WONDER ABOUT THIS
YOU HAVE WORKED ON THIS ALONE
HOW INCONSTANT ARE YOUR FEELINGS BUT A MOMENT AGO YOU WERE MOVED BY MY REPRESENTATIONS AND WHY DO YOU AGAIN HARDEN YOURSELF TO MY COMPLAINTS I SWEAR TO YOU BY THE EARTH WHICH I INHABIT AND BY YOU THAT MADE ME
MOVED FORWARD THEY MOVED TO THE TABLE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED YES
BUT WE RAN WE KNEW NOT WHERE WE WERE GOING WE KNEW ONLY THAT WE MUST RUN RUN TO THE END OF THE WORLD TO THE END OF OUR DAYS THEN WE KNEW SUDDENLY THAT WE WERE LYING ON A SOFT EARTH AND THAT WE HAD STOPPED
THE STARS SHONE AT INTERVALS AS THE CLOUDS PASSED FROM OVER THEM THE DARK PINES ROSE BEFORE ME AND EVERY HERE AND THERE A BROKEN TREE LAY ON THE GROUND IT WAS A SCENE OF WONDERFUL SOLEMNITY AND STIRRED STRANGE THOUGHTS WITHIN ME I WEPT BITTERLY
YET WE WERE YOUNG THIS MORNING WHEN WE CARRIED OUR GLASS BOX THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY TO THE HOME OF THE SCHOLARS NO MEN STOPPED US FOR THERE WERE NONE ABOUT FROM THE PALACE OF CORRECTIVE DETENTION AND THE OTHERS KNEW NOTHING NO MEN STOPPED US AT THE GATE
IT IS TRUE WE SHALL BE MONSTERS CUT OFF FROM ALL THE WORLD BUT ON THAT ACCOUNT WE SHALL BE MORE ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER OUR LIVES WILL NOT BE HAPPY BUT THEY WILL BE HARMLESS AND FREE FROM THE MISERY I NOW FEEL OH MY CREATOR
I WILL GO TO THE VAST WILDS OF SOUTH AMERICA MY FOOD IS NOT THAT OF MAN I DO NOT DESTROY THE LAMB AND THE KID TO GLUT MY APPETITE ACORNS AND BERRIES AFFORD ME SUFFICIENT NOURISHMENT MY COMPANION WILL BE OF THE SAME NATURE AS MYSELF
WE RAN BLINDLY AND MEN AND HOUSES STREAKED PAST US IN A TORRENT WITHOUT SHAPE AND THE ROAD SEEMED NOT TO BE FLAT BEFORE US BUT AS IF IT WERE LEAPING UP TO MEET US
NO SUCH CRIME HAS EVER BEEN COMMITTED AND IT IS NOT FOR US TO JUDGE NOR FOR ANY SMALL COUNCIL WE SHALL DELIVER THIS CREATURE TO THE WORLD COUNCIL ITSELF AND LET THEIR WILL BE DONE WE LOOKED UPON THEM AND WE PLEADED OUR BROTHERS
THE LABOUR OF WINDING AMONG THE LITTLE PATHS OF THE MOUNTAIN AND FIXING MY FEET FIRMLY AS I ADVANCED PERPLEXED ME OCCUPIED AS I WAS BY THE EMOTIONS WHICH THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY HAD PRODUCED NIGHT WAS FAR ADVANCED WHEN I CAME TO THE HALFWAY RESTING PLACE AND SEATED MYSELF BESIDE THE FOUNTAIN
AND OTHERS FROM DISTANT LANDS WHOSE NAMES WE HAD NOT HEARD WE SAW A GREAT PAINTING ON THE WALL OVER THEIR HEADS OF THE TWENTY ILLUSTRIOUS MEN WHO HAD INVENTED THE CANDLE ALL THE HEADS OF THE COUNCIL TURNED TO US AS WE ENTERED
THE PROSPECT OF MARRYING A CHRISTIAN AND REMAINING IN A COUNTRY WHERE WOMEN WERE ALLOWED TO TAKE A RANK IN SOCIETY WAS ENCHANTING TO HER THE DAY FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE TURK WAS FIXED BUT ON THE NIGHT PREVIOUS TO IT HE QUITTED HIS PRISON
IT IS YOURS WE GIVE IT TO YOU STILL THEY WOULD NOT MOVE WE GIVE YOU THE POWER OF THE SKY WE CRIED WE GIVE YOU THE KEY TO THE EARTH TAKE IT AND LET US BE ONE OF YOU THE HUMBLEST AMONG YOU
HIS POWER AND THREATS WERE NOT OMITTED IN MY CALCULATIONS A CREATURE WHO COULD EXIST IN THE ICE CAVES OF THE GLACIERS AND HIDE HIMSELF FROM PURSUIT AMONG THE RIDGES OF INACCESSIBLE PRECIPICES WAS A BEING POSSESSING FACULTIES IT WOULD BE VAIN TO COPE WITH
HIS TALE HAD OCCUPIED THE WHOLE DAY AND THE SUN WAS UPON THE VERGE OF THE HORIZON WHEN HE DEPARTED I KNEW THAT I OUGHT TO HASTEN MY DESCENT TOWARDS THE VALLEY AS I SHOULD SOON BE ENCOMPASSED IN DARKNESS BUT MY HEART WAS HEAVY AND MY STEPS SLOW
THEN WE KNEW WE WERE IN THE UNCHARTED FOREST WE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF COMING HERE BUT OUR LEGS HAD CARRIED OUR WISDOM AND OUR LEGS HAD BROUGHT US TO THE UNCHARTED FOREST AGAINST OUR WILL OUR GLASS BOX LAY BESIDE US
AND BY THE BLUE SKY OF HEAVEN AND BY THE FIRE OF LOVE THAT BURNS MY HEART THAT IF YOU GRANT MY PRAYER WHILE THEY EXIST YOU SHALL NEVER BEHOLD ME AGAIN DEPART TO YOUR HOME AND COMMENCE YOUR LABOURS
AND AT THE SAME TIME SHE GENTLY DEPLORED HER OWN FATE I HAVE COPIES OF THESE LETTERS FOR I FOUND MEANS DURING MY RESIDENCE IN THE HOVEL TO PROCURE THE IMPLEMENTS OF WRITING AND THE LETTERS WERE OFTEN IN THE HANDS OF FELIX OR AGATHA
A FEW MONTHS BEFORE MY ARRIVAL THEY HAD LIVED IN A LARGE AND LUXURIOUS CITY CALLED PARIS SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS AND POSSESSED OF EVERY ENJOYMENT WHICH VIRTUE REFINEMENT OF INTELLECT OR TASTE ACCOMPANIED BY A MODERATE FORTUNE COULD AFFORD
WHERE THE MERCHANT HAD DECIDED TO WAIT A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY OF PASSING INTO SOME PART OF THE TURKISH DOMINIONS
THE YOUNG GIRL SPOKE IN HIGH AND ENTHUSIASTIC TERMS OF HER MOTHER WHO BORN IN FREEDOM SPURNED THE BONDAGE TO WHICH SHE WAS NOW REDUCED SHE INSTRUCTED HER DAUGHTER IN THE TENETS OF HER RELIGION
AND IN MY DYING MOMENTS I SHALL NOT CURSE MY MAKER HIS WORDS HAD A STRANGE EFFECT UPON ME I COMPASSIONATED HIM
YOU WOULD NOT CALL IT MURDER IF YOU COULD PRECIPITATE ME INTO ONE OF THOSE ICE RIFTS AND DESTROY MY FRAME THE WORK OF YOUR OWN HANDS SHALL I RESPECT MAN WHEN HE CONDEMNS ME LET HIM LIVE WITH ME IN THE INTERCHANGE OF KINDNESS AND INSTEAD OF INJURY
WE TURNED AND WE LOOKED AT THEM FOR THE LAST TIME AND A RAGE SUCH AS IT IS NOT FIT FOR HUMANS TO KNOW CHOKED OUR VOICE IN OUR THROAT
AND WILL BE CONTENT WITH THE SAME FARE WE SHALL MAKE OUR BED OF DRIED LEAVES THE SUN WILL SHINE ON US AS ON MAN AND WILL RIPEN OUR FOOD THE PICTURE I PRESENT TO YOU IS PEACEFUL AND HUMAN
DURING THE ENSUING DAYS WHILE THE PREPARATIONS WERE GOING FORWARD FOR THE ESCAPE OF THE MERCHANT THE ZEAL OF FELIX WAS WARMED BY SEVERAL LETTERS THAT HE RECEIVED FROM THIS LOVELY GIRL
AND CLASPING MY HANDS IN AGONY I EXCLAIMED OH STARS AND CLOUDS AND WINDS YE ARE ALL ABOUT TO MOCK ME IF YE REALLY PITY ME CRUSH SENSATION AND MEMORY LET ME BECOME AS NOUGHT BUT IF NOT DEPART
NO WE ANSWERED WHAT IS NOT THOUGHT BY ALL MEN CANNOT BE TRUE
THEY LEAPT TO THEIR FEET THEY RAN FROM THE TABLE AND THEY STOOD PRESSED AGAINST THE WALL HUDDLED TOGETHER SEEKING THE WARMTH OF ONE ANOTHER'S BODIES TO GIVE THEM COURAGE WE LOOKED UPON THEM AND WE LAUGHED AND SAID FEAR NOTHING OUR BROTHERS
IF HE SHOULD CHOOSE TO BETRAY HIM TO THE ITALIAN STATE WHICH THEY INHABITED HE REVOLVED A THOUSAND PLANS BY WHICH HE SHOULD BE ENABLED TO PROLONG THE DECEIT UNTIL IT MIGHT BE NO LONGER NECESSARY
SO WE WALKED ON OUR BOX IN OUR ARMS OUR HEART EMPTY WE ARE DOOMED WHATEVER DAYS ARE LEFT TO US WE SHALL SPEND THEM ALONE AND WE HAVE HEARD OF THE CORRUPTION TO BE FOUND IN SOLITUDE
LISTEN TO US FOR WE HOLD THE FUTURE OF MANKIND IN OUR HANDS THEN THEY LISTENED
WE HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO YOU
I SHUDDERED WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF MY CONSENT BUT I FELT THAT THERE WAS SOME JUSTICE IN HIS ARGUMENT HIS TALE AND THE FEELINGS HE NOW EXPRESSED PROVED HIM TO BE A CREATURE OF FINE SENSATIONS
THEN IT IS A GREAT EVIL FOR MEN HAVE NO CAUSE TO EXIST SAVE IN TOILING FOR OTHER MEN
RESPECTED BY HIS SUPERIORS AND BELOVED BY HIS EQUALS HIS SON WAS BRED IN THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY AND AGATHA HAD RANKED WITH LADIES OF THE HIGHEST DISTINCTION
AND FEAR NOT BUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE READY I SHALL APPEAR SAYING THIS HE SUDDENLY QUITTED ME FEARFUL PERHAPS OF ANY CHANGE IN MY SENTIMENTS I SAW HIM DESCEND THE MOUNTAIN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN THE FLIGHT OF AN EAGLE AND QUICKLY LOST AMONG THE UNDULATIONS OF THE SEA OF ICE
THERE IS NOT A THING BEHIND US TO REGRET THEN A BLOW OF PAIN STRUCK US OUR FIRST AND OUR ONLY WE THOUGHT OF THE GOLDEN ONE WE THOUGHT OF THE GOLDEN ONE WHOM WE SHALL NEVER SEE AGAIN THEN THE PAIN PASSED IT IS BEST
YOU FOOLS YOU THRICE DAMNED FOOLS WE SWUNG OUR FIST THROUGH THE WINDOWPANE AND WE LEAPT OUT IN A RINGING RAIN OF GLASS WE FELL BUT WE NEVER LET THE BOX FALL FROM OUR HANDS THEN WE RAN
HE WAS A TURKISH MERCHANT AND HAD INHABITED PARIS FOR MANY YEARS WHEN FOR SOME REASON WHICH I COULD NOT LEARN
THE BEING FINISHED SPEAKING AND FIXED HIS LOOKS UPON ME IN THE EXPECTATION OF A REPLY BUT I WAS BEWILDERED PERPLEXED AND UNABLE TO ARRANGE MY IDEAS SUFFICIENTLY TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL EXTENT OF HIS PROPOSITION HE CONTINUED
YOU ARE RIGHT LET THE WILL OF THE COUNCIL BE DONE UPON OUR BODY WE DO NOT CARE BUT THE LIGHT WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE LIGHT
I TOOK NO REST BUT RETURNED IMMEDIATELY TO GENEVA EVEN IN MY OWN HEART I COULD GIVE NO EXPRESSION TO MY SENSATIONS THEY WEIGHED ON ME WITH A MOUNTAIN'S WEIGHT AND THEIR EXCESS DESTROYED MY AGONY BENEATH THEM
THAT IT WOULD BECOME HER TO PURSUE IN THIS EMERGENCY A RESIDENCE IN TURKEY WAS ABHORRENT TO HER HER RELIGION AND HER FEELINGS WERE ALIKE AVERSE TO IT BY SOME PAPERS OF HER FATHER WHICH FELL INTO HER HANDS SHE HEARD OF THE EXILE OF HER LOVER
BUT WHEN THE MAJORITY OF THEIR BROTHER SCHOLARS VOTED AGAINST THEM THEY ABANDONED THEIR IDEAS AS ALL MEN MUST THIS BOX IS USELESS
WE ANSWERED WHAT IS NOT DONE COLLECTIVELY CANNOT BE GOOD
AND TOLD HER HASTILY THAT HE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HIS RESIDENCE AT LEGHORN HAD BEEN DIVULGED AND THAT HE SHOULD SPEEDILY BE DELIVERED UP TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT HE HAD CONSEQUENTLY HIRED A VESSEL TO CONVEY HIM TO CONSTANTINOPLE
THE LATTER PART OF HIS TALE HAD KINDLED ANEW IN ME THE ANGER THAT HAD DIED AWAY WHILE HE NARRATED HIS PEACEFUL LIFE AMONG THE COTTAGERS AND AS HE SAID THIS I COULD NO LONGER SUPPRESS THE RAGE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME I DO REFUSE IT I REPLIED
IF ANY BEING FELT EMOTIONS OF BENEVOLENCE TOWARDS ME I SHOULD RETURN THEM A HUNDRED AND A HUNDREDFOLD FOR THAT ONE CREATURE'S SAKE I WOULD MAKE PEACE WITH THE WHOLE KIND BUT I NOW INDULGE IN DREAMS OF BLISS THAT CANNOT BE REALIZED
THIS THING THEY SAID MUST BE DESTROYED AND ALL THE OTHERS CRIED AS ONE IT MUST BE DESTROYED THEN WE LEAPT TO THE TABLE WE SEIZED OUR BOX WE SHOVED THEM ASIDE AND WE RAN TO THE WINDOW
HIS FACE WAS WRINKLED INTO CONTORTIONS TOO HORRIBLE FOR HUMAN EYES TO BEHOLD BUT PRESENTLY HE CALMED HIMSELF AND PROCEEDED I INTENDED TO REASON THIS PASSION IS DETRIMENTAL TO ME FOR YOU DO NOT REFLECT THAT YOU ARE THE CAUSE OF ITS EXCESS
THESE GREAT AND WISE OF THE EARTH DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF US AND THEY LOOKED UPON US WITH WONDER AND CURIOSITY AS IF WE WERE A MIRACLE IT IS TRUE THAT OUR TUNIC WAS TORN AND STAINED WITH BROWN STAINS WHICH HAD BEEN BLOOD
BEFORE WHICH TIME THE TURK RENEWED HIS PROMISE THAT SHE SHOULD BE UNITED TO HIS DELIVERER AND FELIX REMAINED WITH THEM IN EXPECTATION OF THAT EVENT AND IN THE MEANTIME HE ENJOYED THE SOCIETY OF THE ARABIAN
BLACK AGAINST THE LAST GOLD OF THE SKY THE MOSS IS SOFT AND WARM WE SHALL SLEEP ON THIS MOSS FOR MANY NIGHTS TILL THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST COME TO TEAR OUR BODY WE HAVE NO BED NOW SAVE THE MOSS AND NO FUTURE SAVE THE BEASTS WE ARE OLD NOW
AND DID I NOT AS HIS MAKER OWE HIM ALL THE PORTION OF HAPPINESS THAT IT WAS IN MY POWER TO BESTOW HE SAW MY CHANGE OF FEELING AND CONTINUED IF YOU CONSENT NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING SHALL EVER SEE US AGAIN
BEFORE I DEPART I WILL GIVE THEM TO YOU THEY WILL PROVE THE TRUTH OF MY TALE BUT AT PRESENT AS THE SUN IS ALREADY FAR DECLINED I SHALL ONLY HAVE TIME TO REPEAT THE SUBSTANCE OF THEM TO YOU
I HAVE ANSWERED YOU YOU MAY TORTURE ME BUT I WILL NEVER CONSENT YOU ARE IN THE WRONG REPLIED THE FIEND AND INSTEAD OF THREATENING I AM CONTENT TO REASON WITH YOU I AM MALICIOUS BECAUSE I AM MISERABLE
AND SECRETLY TO TAKE HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIM WHEN HE DEPARTED HIS PLANS WERE FACILITATED BY THE NEWS WHICH ARRIVED FROM PARIS THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE WERE GREATLY ENRAGED AT THE ESCAPE OF THEIR VICTIM
LET US ALL WORK TOGETHER AND HARNESS THIS POWER AND MAKE IT EASE THE TOIL OF MEN LET US THROW AWAY OUR CANDLES AND OUR TORCHES LET US FLOOD OUR CITIES WITH LIGHT LET US BRING A NEW LIGHT TO MEN
WE RAISED OUR RIGHT ARM AND WE SAID
AND BECOME LINKED TO THE CHAIN OF EXISTENCE AND EVENTS FROM WHICH I AM NOW EXCLUDED I PAUSED SOME TIME TO REFLECT ON ALL HE HAD RELATED AND THE VARIOUS ARGUMENTS WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED I THOUGHT OF THE PROMISE OF VIRTUES WHICH HE HAD DISPLAYED ON THE OPENING OF HIS EXISTENCE
ABOUT TWENTY LEAGUES FROM THE COTTAGE OF DE LACEY WHEN HER ATTENDANT FELL DANGEROUSLY ILL
FOR ALL THE SCHOLARS SPOKE AT ONCE AND THEY WERE ANGRY AND FRIGHTENED A STREET SWEEPER A STREET SWEEPER WALKING IN UPON THE WORLD COUNCIL OF SCHOLARS IT IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED IT IS AGAINST ALL THE RULES AND ALL THE LAWS
HIS BLIND AND AGED FATHER AND HIS GENTLE SISTER LAY IN A NOISOME DUNGEON WHILE HE ENJOYED THE FREE AIR AND THE SOCIETY OF HER WHOM HE LOVED THIS IDEA WAS TORTURE TO HIM
I WILL WORK AT YOUR DESTRUCTION NOR FINISH UNTIL I DESOLATE YOUR HEART SO THAT YOU SHALL CURSE THE HOUR OF YOUR BIRTH A FIENDISH RAGE ANIMATED HIM AS HE SAID THIS
AS IF NEVER MORE MIGHT I ENJOY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THEM YET EVEN THUS I LOVED THEM TO ADORATION AND TO SAVE THEM I RESOLVED TO DEDICATE MYSELF TO MY MOST ABHORRED TASK THE PROSPECT OF SUCH AN OCCUPATION MADE EVERY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF EXISTENCE PASS BEFORE ME LIKE A DREAM
AND THEN QUITTING THE LOVELY ARABIAN HE HASTENED TO PARIS AND DELIVERED HIMSELF UP TO THE VENGEANCE OF THE LAW HOPING TO FREE DE LACEY AND AGATHA BY THIS PROCEEDING
YOU MUST CREATE A FEMALE FOR ME WITH WHOM I CAN LIVE IN THE INTERCHANGE OF THOSE SYMPATHIES NECESSARY FOR MY BEING THIS YOU ALONE CAN DO AND I DEMAND IT OF YOU AS A RIGHT WHICH YOU MUST NOT REFUSE TO CONCEDE
AND NO TORTURE SHALL EVER EXTORT A CONSENT FROM ME YOU MAY RENDER ME THE MOST MISERABLE OF MEN BUT YOU SHALL NEVER MAKE ME BASE IN MY OWN EYES SHALL I CREATE ANOTHER LIKE YOURSELF WHOSE JOINT WICKEDNESS MIGHT DESOLATE THE WORLD BEGONE
I HAD NO RIGHT TO WITHHOLD FROM HIM THE SMALL PORTION OF HAPPINESS WHICH WAS YET IN MY POWER TO BESTOW YOU SWEAR I SAID TO BE HARMLESS BUT HAVE YOU NOT ALREADY SHOWN A DEGREE OF MALICE THAT SHOULD REASONABLY MAKE ME DISTRUST YOU
EACH INTERESTING AND WONDERFUL TO ONE SO UTTERLY INEXPERIENCED AS I WAS THE NAME OF THE OLD MAN WAS DE LACEY HE WAS DESCENDED FROM A GOOD FAMILY IN FRANCE WHERE HE HAD LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN AFFLUENCE
AND THEN LOOKED AROUND FOR THE MEANS AFTER MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS TO GAIN ADMITTANCE TO THE PRISON HE FOUND A STRONGLY GRATED WINDOW IN AN UNGUARDED PART OF THE BUILDING WHICH LIGHTED THE DUNGEON OF THE UNFORTUNATE MUHAMMADAN
WE HAVE TORN OURSELVES FROM THE TRUTH WHICH IS OUR BROTHER MEN AND THERE IS NO ROAD BACK FOR US AND NO REDEMPTION WE KNOW THESE THINGS BUT WE DO NOT CARE WE CARE FOR NOTHING ON EARTH WE ARE TIRED
AND BEING IMMURED WITHIN THE WALLS OF A HAREM ALLOWED ONLY TO OCCUPY HERSELF WITH INFANTILE AMUSEMENTS ILL SUITED TO THE TEMPER OF HER SOUL NOW ACCUSTOMED TO GRAND IDEAS AND A NOBLE EMULATION FOR VIRTUE
THE TURK QUICKLY PERCEIVED THE IMPRESSION THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD MADE ON THE HEART OF FELIX AND ENDEAVOURED TO SECURE HIM MORE ENTIRELY IN HIS INTERESTS BY THE PROMISE OF HER HAND IN MARRIAGE SO SOON AS HE SHOULD BE CONVEYED TO A PLACE OF SAFETY FELIX WAS TOO DELICATE TO ACCEPT THIS OFFER
SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE I LEARNED THE HISTORY OF MY FRIENDS IT WAS ONE WHICH COULD NOT FAIL TO IMPRESS ITSELF DEEPLY ON MY MIND UNFOLDING AS IT DID A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT WITH THE COMPANION YOU BESTOW I WILL QUIT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AND DWELL AS IT MAY CHANCE IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF PLACES MY EVIL PASSIONS WILL HAVE FLED FOR I SHALL MEET WITH SYMPATHY MY LIFE WILL FLOW QUIETLY AWAY
WE SPOKE OF IT AND OF OUR LONG QUEST AND OF OUR TUNNEL AND OF OUR ESCAPE FROM THE PALACE OF CORRECTIVE DETENTION NOT A HAND MOVED IN THAT HALL AS WE SPOKE NOR AN EYE THEN WE PUT THE WIRES TO THE BOX AND THEY ALL BENT FORWARD AND SAT STILL WATCHING
AND BEFORE MORNING WAS DISTANT MANY LEAGUES FROM PARIS
FELIX HAD ACCIDENTALLY BEEN PRESENT AT THE TRIAL HIS HORROR AND INDIGNATION WERE UNCONTROLLABLE WHEN HE HEARD THE DECISION OF THE COURT
THUS I RETURNED HOME AND ENTERING THE HOUSE PRESENTED MYSELF TO THE FAMILY MY HAGGARD AND WILD APPEARANCE AWOKE INTENSE ALARM BUT I ANSWERED NO QUESTION SCARCELY DID I SPEAK I FELT AS IF I WERE PLACED UNDER A BAN AS IF I HAD NO RIGHT TO CLAIM THEIR SYMPATHIES
THE OLDEST AND WISEST OF THE COUNCIL SPOKE AND ASKED WHO ARE YOU OUR BROTHER FOR YOU DO NOT LOOK LIKE A SCHOLAR
THEN IT WOULD BRING RUIN TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CANDLES
BUT THE POOR GIRL DIED AND THE ARABIAN WAS LEFT ALONE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY AND UTTERLY IGNORANT OF THE CUSTOMS OF THE WORLD
DEPART AND LEAVE ME IN DARKNESS THESE WERE WILD AND MISERABLE THOUGHTS BUT I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW THE ETERNAL TWINKLING OF THE STARS WEIGHED UPON ME AND HOW I LISTENED TO EVERY BLAST OF WIND AS IF IT WERE A DULL UGLY SIROC ON ITS WAY TO CONSUME ME
THEY REMAINED CONFINED FOR FIVE MONTHS BEFORE THE TRIAL TOOK PLACE THE RESULT OF WHICH DEPRIVED THEM OF THEIR FORTUNE AND CONDEMNED THEM TO A PERPETUAL EXILE FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY THEY FOUND A MISERABLE ASYLUM IN THE COTTAGE IN GERMANY WHERE I DISCOVERED THEM
WHILE IN HIS HEART HE HAD FORMED FAR OTHER PLANS HE LOATHED THE IDEA THAT HIS DAUGHTER SHOULD BE UNITED TO A CHRISTIAN BUT HE FEARED THE RESENTMENT OF FELIX IF HE SHOULD APPEAR LUKEWARM
FOR WHICH CITY HE SHOULD SAIL IN A FEW HOURS HE INTENDED TO LEAVE HIS DAUGHTER UNDER THE CARE OF A CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT TO FOLLOW AT HER LEISURE WITH THE GREATER PART OF HIS PROPERTY WHICH HAD NOT YET ARRIVED AT LEGHORN WHEN ALONE
PITILESS AS YOU HAVE BEEN TOWARDS ME I NOW SEE COMPASSION IN YOUR EYES LET ME SEIZE THE FAVOURABLE MOMENT AND PERSUADE YOU TO PROMISE WHAT I SO ARDENTLY DESIRE YOU PROPOSE REPLIED I
SHE ATTEMPTED TO EXPOSTULATE WITH HER FATHER BUT HE LEFT HER ANGRILY REITERATING HIS TYRANNICAL MANDATE A FEW DAYS AFTER THE TURK ENTERED HIS DAUGHTER'S APARTMENT
AFTER A LONG PAUSE OF REFLECTION I CONCLUDED THAT THE JUSTICE DUE BOTH TO HIM AND MY FELLOW CREATURES DEMANDED OF ME THAT I SHOULD COMPLY WITH HIS REQUEST TURNING TO HIM THEREFORE I SAID I CONSENT TO YOUR DEMAND
THIS TOUCHED UPON THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MEN WORKING IN SCORES OF STATES
AND SPARED NO PAINS TO DETECT AND PUNISH HIS DELIVERER THE PLOT OF FELIX WAS QUICKLY DISCOVERED AND DE LACEY AND AGATHA WERE THROWN INTO PRISON THE NEWS REACHED FELIX AND ROUSED HIM FROM HIS DREAM OF PLEASURE
WE ANSWERED AND WE ARE A STREET SWEEPER OF THIS CITY
BUT WE KNEW HOW TO STOP THEM OUR BROTHERS WE SAID WE MATTER NOT NOR OUR TRANSGRESSION IT IS ONLY OUR BROTHER MEN WHO MATTER GIVE NO THOUGHT TO US FOR WE ARE NOTHING BUT LISTEN TO OUR WORDS
HE QUICKLY ARRANGED WITH THE TURK THAT IF THE LATTER SHOULD FIND A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ESCAPE BEFORE FELIX COULD RETURN TO ITALY SAFIE SHOULD REMAIN AS A BOARDER AT A CONVENT AT LEGHORN
BUT THEY LOOKED UPON US AND SUDDENLY WE WERE AFRAID FOR THEIR EYES WERE STILL AND SMALL AND EVIL OUR BROTHERS WE CRIED HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY TO US
WHAT I ASK OF YOU IS REASONABLE AND MODERATE I DEMAND A CREATURE OF ANOTHER SEX BUT AS HIDEOUS AS MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION IS SMALL BUT IT IS ALL THAT I CAN RECEIVE AND IT SHALL CONTENT ME
WE SAW NOTHING AS WE ENTERED SAVE THE SKY IN THE GREAT WINDOWS BLUE AND GLOWING
I WOULD BESTOW EVERY BENEFIT UPON HIM WITH TEARS OF GRATITUDE AT HIS ACCEPTANCE BUT THAT CANNOT BE THE HUMAN SENSES ARE INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS TO OUR UNION YET MINE SHALL NOT BE THE SUBMISSION OF ABJECT SLAVERY
AND IF THIS SHOULD LIGHTEN THE TOIL OF MEN
THE ARRIVAL OF THE ARABIAN NOW INFUSED NEW LIFE INTO HIS SOUL WHEN THE NEWS REACHED LEGHORN THAT FELIX WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS WEALTH AND RANK THE MERCHANT COMMANDED HIS DAUGHTER TO THINK NO MORE OF HER LOVER BUT TO PREPARE TO RETURN TO HER NATIVE COUNTRY
WHO FOUND MEANS TO EXPRESS HER THOUGHTS IN THE LANGUAGE OF HER LOVER BY THE AID OF AN OLD MAN A SERVANT OF HER FATHER WHO UNDERSTOOD FRENCH SHE THANKED HIM IN THE MOST ARDENT TERMS FOR HIS INTENDED SERVICES TOWARDS HER PARENT
WHEN I SAW THE FILTHY MASS THAT MOVED AND TALKED MY HEART SICKENED AND MY FEELINGS WERE ALTERED TO THOSE OF HORROR AND HATRED I TRIED TO STIFLE THESE SENSATIONS I THOUGHT THAT AS I COULD NOT SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM
ON YOUR SOLEMN OATH TO QUIT EUROPE FOREVER AND EVERY OTHER PLACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AS SOON AS I SHALL DELIVER INTO YOUR HANDS A FEMALE WHO WILL ACCOMPANY YOU IN YOUR EXILE I SWEAR HE CRIED BY THE SUN
HAVE HAD STRANGE NEW IDEAS IN THE PAST
AND MY VIRTUES WILL NECESSARILY ARISE WHEN I LIVE IN COMMUNION WITH AN EQUAL
THEREFORE IT CANNOT BE DESTROYED BY THE WHIM OF ONE
HE WAS TRIED AND CONDEMNED TO DEATH THE INJUSTICE OF HIS SENTENCE WAS VERY FLAGRANT ALL PARIS WAS INDIGNANT AND IT WAS JUDGED THAT HIS RELIGION AND WEALTH RATHER THAN THE CRIME ALLEGED AGAINST HIM HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF HIS CONDEMNATION
WAITED IN DESPAIR THE EXECUTION OF THE BARBAROUS SENTENCE FELIX VISITED THE GRATE AT NIGHT AND MADE KNOWN TO THE PRISONER HIS INTENTIONS IN HIS FAVOUR THE TURK AMAZED AND DELIGHTED ENDEAVOURED TO KINDLE THE ZEAL OF HIS DELIVERER
AND LEARNT THE NAME OF THE SPOT WHERE HE THEN RESIDED SHE HESITATED SOME TIME BUT AT LENGTH SHE FORMED HER DETERMINATION TAKING WITH HER SOME JEWELS THAT BELONGED TO HER AND A SUM OF MONEY SHE QUITTED ITALY WITH AN ATTENDANT A NATIVE OF LEGHORN
MEN ARE MORAL UNDER THE EYES OF THEIR NEIGHBORS ACQUAINTANCES AND FAMILIES HABITS BECOME ADJUSTED TO RIGHT STANDARDS AND THE TEMPTATIONS IN NEW CONDITIONS ARE ALWAYS GREAT UNTIL OF LATE
IN SOMEWHAT INCONSISTENT WAYS LAND IT WAS SAID
INCREASES THE ECONOMIC SUPPLY OF MOST SCARCE GOODS AND PROVIDES SUBSTITUTES FOR THE OTHERS SOME INVENTIONS INCREASE ECONOMIC SUPPLY BY MAKING AVAILABLE THE USES IN GOODS THAT WERE BEFORE UNAVAILABLE
AFFECT AND LIMIT THE DEMAND AND THUS INCREASE THE SUPPLY MEN CANNOT IT IS TRUE INCREASE THE STORES OF COPPER IN THE EARTH BUT THEY DEVISE NEW PROCESSES TO EXTRACT IT FROM ORES BEFORE WORTHLESS AND INVENT METHODS OF PROCURING ALUMINIUM
AND TIME IS COSTLY MAN THEREFORE TRIES IN OTHER WAYS TO FORCE MORE USES OUT OF GOODS UNTIL CHECKED BY THE INCREASING DIFFICULTY
WHICH YIELDS SOME OF THE SAME UTILITIES AS COPPER EVEN THE SUPPLY OF LAND AS IS SHOWN ELSEWHERE IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING THUS ALL KINDS OF WEALTH CAN BE INCREASED IN SOME DEGREE MANY KINDS IN THE COURSE OF TIME
WHEN MEN CROSSED THE OCEAN TO SETTLE ON MANHATTAN ISLAND IT WAS A WILDERNESS
AND OUT AT THE OTHER WITHOUT THE LOSS OF A SINGLE MOTION FACTORIES COMPEL GREAT NUMBERS OF LABORERS TO LIVE NEAR EACH OTHER AND TO WORK TOGETHER THE SUDDEN CROWDING TOGETHER OF PEOPLE INTO NEW SOCIAL RELATIONS IS USUALLY BAD FOR MORALS
FOR ITS CONCRETE FRUITS LOOKED AT IN THE MODERN WAY IT IS VALUED AS A MARKETABLE INCOME BEARER
THERE ARE STILL GREAT AREAS OF FENS SWAMPS AND MARSHLANDS SUCH AS THOSE ON THE JERSEY COAST IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH WITH MODERATE EFFORT COULD BE RECLAIMED
SOME KINDS OF GOODS ARE PRODUCED FROM SUCH VERY COMMON MATERIALS THAT IT MIGHT SEEM POSSIBLE BY THE SUBSTITUTION OF AGENTS TO PRODUCE AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY HOW CAN BRICKS BE LIMITED IN NUMBER
THE RECLAIMING OF LAND IN HOLLAND IS A STRIKING BUT FAR FROM ISOLATED EXAMPLE AMONG THE LARGER UNDERTAKINGS OF THIS KIND ARE THE DRAINING OF THE HAARLEM LAKE IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIFTY EIGHT BY WHICH FORTY THOUSAND ACRES OF RICH LAND WERE MADE AVAILABLE
AS A PRODUCER OF A SUPPLY OF LAND IS HOWEVER OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE THE PIONEER ANNEXES NEW AREAS TO THE ECONOMIC WORLD AND TO THE MARKET IN WHICH HE HAS LIVED THIS IS RECOGNIZED OF LATE BY WRITERS
THAT PERHAPS DO NOT FULLY MARK ITS SIGNIFICANCE TO ECONOMIC THEORY
SEEKING STEADILY A LARGER CROP A LARGER INCOME ACCOMPLISH WONDERS IN BRINGING WASTE LAND TO A HIGH STATE OF CULTIVATION WORKING ON THE SOIL THAT IS AT ONCE THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND THEIR HOME THEY DO NOT CONSCIOUSLY RECKON THE VALUE OF THE LABOR THEY ARE PUTTING UPON IT
THE WORD SUPPLY MEANS THE AMOUNT THAT IS AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT OR DURING THE PERIOD SPOKEN OF THE LAND IN GREENLAND IS NOT AND PROBABLY NEVER CAN BE A PART OF THE SUPPLY OF LAND IN ENGLAND THE LAND IN AMERICA FOR CENTURIES WAS NOT
SUBSOIL PLOUGHING ANNEXES TO AGRICULTURAL LAND NEW LAYERS OF SOIL THAT ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS NEW ACRES ADDED TO THE SURFACE IF LAND COULD BE USED THREE TIMES AS DEEP IT WOULD BE AS GOOD FOR MANY PURPOSES
IN ANY EVENT WITHOUT ANY LIMIT EVER APPRECIABLE TO MAN WITHOUT ANY INCREASE IN THE COST OR SCARCITY THIS CLASS OF GOODS WAS CONSIDERED TO BE VERY LARGE THERE IS NO SUCH CLASS OF ECONOMIC GOODS IT IS EVIDENTLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE
ACCOUNT MUST BE TAKEN OF THE FACT THAT THE NUMBER OF BRICKS CAN BE INCREASED MORE EASILY THAN THE AMOUNT OF LAND BUT THERE MUST NOT BE OVERLOOKED THE POSSIBILITY OF INCREASE IN ANY OF THESE FORMS OF WEALTH NOR THE LIMITS TO THE INCREASE OF ANY ONE OF THEM
AND THE EARLY FACTORIES WITH THEIR SURROUNDINGS WERE MOST UNSANITARY UNDER THE DEGRADING CONDITIONS THAT RESULTED IN SOME PLACES
BUT NOW HAS BECOME FOR SOME PURPOSES A PART OF THE SUPPLY IN THE SAME MARKET AS THE LAND OF ENGLAND THE QUESTION OF IMPORTANCE IN ECONOMIC DISCUSSION IS NOT WHETHER THE PHYSICAL MATERIAL CAN BE BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE
MUST LEAD TO FALSE CONCLUSIONS THE RATE OF THIS MOVEMENT HAS BEEN MORE RAPID IN THE PAST CENTURY THAN THERETOFORE AND PERHAPS MORE RAPID THAN IT WILL BE HENCEFORWARD BUT THAT THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL CONTINUE IN LARGE MEASURE
WHICH IS ADDING ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MINOR UNDERTAKINGS OF THE KIND THE AREA RECLAIMED IS RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED WITH THE WHOLE AREA OF THE LAND IN THE WORLD USED FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES
THESE ARE FREE GOODS BECAUSE HOWEVER MUCH IS USED THE SUPPLY IS IMMEDIATELY RENEWED BUT THEY ARE UNDIMINISHED ONLY IN A RELATIVE SENSE AND IN REFERENCE TO PRESENT NEED THE WATER IN THE WESTERN RIVERS LONG FLOWED ON
ANY EXPLANATION OF THE ECONOMIC OCCURRENCES OF THE LAST FIVE CENTURIES OR OF THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE THAT IGNORES THIS FACT
UNDIMINISHED BY THE USES MADE OF IT BUT PROGRESSING CIVILIZATION REQUIRED MORE WATER FOR CITIES FOR MINING AND FOR IRRIGATION AND NOW STATES AND CORPORATIONS ARE GOING TO LAW OVER THESE FORMERLY UNDIMINISHED FREE GOODS
AS IT WAS CALLED FORMERLY WERE CONSIDERED TO BE A PECULIAR CLASS COMPRISING ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF WEALTH BUT IT CAN NOW BE SEEN THAT THE LAW MAY APPLY ULTIMATELY THOUGH IN DIFFERING DEGREES
BUT THE ECONOMIC SUPPLY IS SIGNIFICANT THERE IS DANGER OF CONFUSION BETWEEN THESE TWO IDEAS
RESULTS IN HISTORICAL DIMINISHING RETURNS AS WAS STRIKINGLY ILLUSTRATED IN ENGLISH EXPERIENCE DURING THE NAPOLEONIC WARS WHEN WHEAT ROSE IN VALUE BECAUSE OF THE GREATER DIFFICULTY OF PRODUCING THE LARGER SUPPLY NEEDED
WHETHER THIS IS ITS NATURAL RESULT IS DEBATABLE BUT THE FACTORY WORKER IN GENERAL DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE LESS INTELLIGENT THAN THE AGRICULTURAL WORKER THE ALERTNESS OF THE CITY DWELLER IS DUE DOUBTLESS TO SOCIAL CONTACT MORE THAN TO THE IMMEDIATE WORK HE DOES
IN A PARTICULAR TRADE INTO WHICH MACHINERY IS SUDDENLY INTRODUCED WHEN AS SOMETIMES HAPPENS EMPLOYERS INTRODUCE MACHINES FOR THE IMMEDIATE PURPOSE OF BREAKING A STRIKE THE WORKMEN ARE CONVINCED THAT MACHINERY IS THE ENEMY OF LABOR
BEING MADE AS THEY ARE FROM ONE OF THE COMMONEST MATERIALS ON THE EARTH'S SURFACE BUT THE LARGEST CLAY BANKS ARE LIMITED IN SIZE A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE PLACES WHERE BRICKS ARE NEEDED ARE NOT NEAR A SUPPLY OF CLAY OF GOOD QUALITY AND AFTER A BRICK YARD HAS BEEN USED FOR A TIME
BECAUSE THE EXTENSIVE INTRODUCTION OF MACHINERY IN ENGLAND WAS AT FIRST ACCOMPANIED BY THE UNHAPPY RESULT OF A LENGTHENING OF THE HOURS OF LABOR IN FACTORIES THIS RESULT WAS DEEMED TO BE NECESSARY IN ALL OTHER CASES IT WAS IN FACT QUITE ABNORMAL
THE THOUGHT THAT LONG OBTAINED AMONG ECONOMISTS IT WAS SAID THAT THE SUPPLY OF CERTAIN THINGS WAS ABSOLUTELY FIXED THE CHIEF OF THESE BEING LAND USED FOR AGRICULTURE THE IDEA AS HELD BY MALTHUS AND RICARDO WAS MODIFIED BY JOHN STUART MILL
BEARING A CERTAIN RELATION TO IT THE FIRST THOUGHT IS OF THE VALUE OF THE WEALTH INVESTED WHICH HAS BEEN CAREFULLY MEASURED AND EXPRESSED IN DOLLARS AND CENTS WEALTH LOOKED AT IN THE OLDER WAY WAS VALUED FOR WHAT IT DID IMMEDIATELY FOR ITS OWNER
THIS WORK MAY OR MAY NOT BE LESS THOUGHT AWAKENING THAN WORK WITH SIMPLE TOOLS THERE IS A GENERAL IMPROVEMENT ALONG ALL THE LINES OF INTELLIGENCE MORALS
PEASANT OWNERS AND SMALL PROPRIETORS
AND FOR A LONG PERIOD IS NOT OPEN TO QUESTION UNDEVELOPED AREAS WILL BE OPENED TO THE WORLD AND NEW GEOLOGIC REALMS WILL BE EXPLORED
IDENTICAL IN NATURE WITH THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED HAD AN EQUAL AREA OF SOMEWHAT LESS FERTILE LAND TOUCHING ENGLAND RISEN OUT OF THE OCEAN
WHEN ONE WISHES TO SAVE OR INCREASE WEALTH HE TURNS TO THESE GREAT UNAPPROPRIATED FIELDS UNUSED THINGS OR THINGS IMPERFECTLY USED AND TRIES TO CONVERT THEM INTO EFFECTIVE AGENTS
WHOSE INCREASE IS SEEN TO BE GAINED WITH INCREASING DIFFICULTY THIS IS SEEN MOST CLEARLY IN THE DIMINISHING RETURNS FROM LAND IN THE ATTEMPT TO GET SOME FOOD PRODUCTS IN GREATER QUANTITY FROM A GIVEN AREA AT A GIVEN TIME
NEW TRADE ROUTES AND NEW MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION ADD TO THE SUPPLIES AVAILABLE IN THE OLDER COUNTRIES AS EFFECTIVELY AS IF THEIR AREAS WERE INCREASED THE BUILDING OF RAILROADS IN WESTERN AMERICA HAD AN EFFECT ON ENGLISH RENTS
WHILE THEREFORE BRICKS ARE SCARCE AND HARD TO GET FROM THE OUTSET IN SOME PLACES THE SCARCITY GROWS MORE MARKED IN MANY PLACES AT FIRST WELL SUPPLIED IF MATERIALS ARE SCARCE IN ANY DEGREE THEIR CONTINUED USE FOR ONE PURPOSE
SOME REPLENISHING AGENTS WILL RESTORE THEMSELVES IF GIVEN TIME THE FOREST WILL GROW UP IF LEFT UNTOUCHED BY MAN THE FIELD WILL RECOVER ITS FERTILE QUALITY IF ALLOWED TO LIE FALLOW BUT THIS SELF REPLENISHING OF AGENTS IS A SLOW PROCESS
EVERY COUNTRY IN EUROPE HAS REPEATEDLY FELT THE SHOCK OF THESE GREAT ECONOMIC CHANGES WHICH HAVE COMPELLED THE RECAPITALIZATION ON A LOWER PLANE
ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY EVEN WHEN THE EXACT THING CANNOT BE DUPLICATED AS A BUST BY AN ANCIENT SCULPTOR OR AN AUTOGRAPH OF A DEAD AUTHOR MANY SUBSTITUTES SERVING THE SAME OR CLOSELY RELATED WANTS
THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF WEALTH MAY BE RANGED ON A SCALE ACCORDING TO THE EASE WITH WHICH THEY CAN BE INCREASED BY EFFORT
AND RELATIVELY INCREASABLE SOME NATURAL RESOURCES BELONG AT ONE END AND SOME AT THE OTHER END OF THIS SCALE NO HARD AND FAST LINE DIVIDES THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF GOODS
THEREFORE ITS SUPPLY IS FIXED THE SECOND PART OF THE OPENING PROPOSITION EXPRESSES THE VIEW HERE HELD THE SUPPLY OF NO IMPORTANT CLASS OF GOODS IS ABSOLUTELY FIXED IN ANY REASONABLE SENSE MOST IF NOT ALL BELONG TO THE CLASS THAT IS INCREASABLE
BY MEANS OF SUCH PHYSICAL CHANGES
AND WHERE THIS IS COMMON IT IS SPOKEN OF AS THE FACTORY SYSTEM IN THE IDEAL MODERN FACTORY REALIZED IN FEW CASES EACH SMALLER MACHINE IS A PART OF A LARGER ORGANIZATION OF MACHINERY
NO MONEY CAN BUY THAT WHICH TO THEM IS BEYOND PRICE BUT IN OUR MONEY ECONOMY EFFORTS ARE LARGELY DIRECTED TOWARD THE INCREASE OF THE CAPITAL SUM INVESTMENT TAKES THE FORM OF PUTTING IN A SUM OF MONEY IN THE HOPE OF GETTING AN INCOME
BEING AT THE SAME TIME DEMORALIZED AND DEPRESSED BY INDUSTRIAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES THAT HAD NO LOGICAL CONNECTION WITH MACHINERY HAD NO POWER TO RESIST THIS MOVEMENT IN ALL OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AND IN AMERICA
AND HAS NOT BEEN SEEN ELSEWHERE THE OWNERS OF FACTORIES WISHED TO KEEP THEIR MACHINES EMPLOYED AS MANY HOURS AS POSSIBLE THE LABORING CLASSES OF ENGLAND
INCREASING DIFFICULTY IS MET WITH AT ONCE THIS ATTEMPT
GREAT AREAS ON THE EDGE OF CIVILIZATION STILL AWAIT THE PIONEER THE PROSPECTOR AND THE MINER HERE IS A SOURCE OF WEALTH AND A FIELD FOR ENTERPRISE THE GROWTH OF SOCIETY MAY CAUSE SOME OF THE POORER AGENTS IN TIME TO BECOME THE BEST
INCREASES THEIR SCARCITY IN ALL OTHER USES ECONOMIC GOODS ARE GOODS HAVING VALUE VALUE IMPLIES SCARCITY
SO THE HUMAN SOUL RETAINS ITS PROPER EXISTENCE WHEN SEPARATED FROM THE BODY HAVING AN APTITUDE AND A NATURAL INCLINATION TO BE UNITED TO THE BODY
YET IT IS THE STONE WHICH IS UNDERSTOOD NOT THE LIKENESS OF THE STONE
ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT LIKENESSES IN THE SAME WAY SEVERAL INTELLECTS UNDERSTAND ONE OBJECT UNDERSTOOD BUT THERE IS THIS DIFFERENCE ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF ARISTOTLE BETWEEN THE SENSE AND THE INTELLIGENCE
SUCH AS THE SENSITIVE SOUL AND THE NUTRITIVE SOUL FOR CORRUPTIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE ARE NOT OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE BUT THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS INCORRUPTIBLE WHEREAS THE OTHER SOULS AS THE SENSITIVE AND THE NUTRITIVE
THUS THROUGH THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES THE POSSIBLE INTELLECT IS LINKED TO THE BODY OF THIS OR THAT PARTICULAR MAN BUT THIS LINK OR UNION DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAIN THE FACT THAT THE ACT OF THE INTELLECT IS THE ACT OF SOCRATES
FURTHER WHATEVER RECEPTIVE POWER IS AN ACT OF A BODY RECEIVES A FORM MATERIALLY AND INDIVIDUALLY FOR WHAT IS RECEIVED MUST BE RECEIVED ACCORDING TO THE CONDITION OF THE RECEIVER
WHENCE ARISTOTLE CONCLUDES
WHEREAS THE NATURE OF THE THING UNDERSTOOD IS INDEED OUTSIDE THE SOUL BUT THE MODE ACCORDING TO WHICH IT EXISTS OUTSIDE THE SOUL IS NOT THE MODE ACCORDING TO WHICH IT IS UNDERSTOOD FOR THE COMMON NATURE IS UNDERSTOOD AS APART FROM THE INDIVIDUATING PRINCIPLES
FURTHER IF IT BE SAID THAT THE SENSITIVE SOUL IN MAN IS INCORRUPTIBLE ON THE CONTRARY CORRUPTIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE DIFFER GENERICALLY SAYS THE PHILOSOPHER
ARE CORRUPTIBLE AS WAS SHOWN ABOVE QUESTION SEVENTY FIVE A SIX THEREFORE IN MAN THE ESSENCE OF THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THE SENSITIVE SOUL AND THE NUTRITIVE SOUL CANNOT BE THE SAME
WE NOW CONSIDER THE UNION OF THE SOUL WITH THE BODY AND CONCERNING THIS THERE ARE EIGHT POINTS OF INQUIRY ONE WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM TWO
WHEREAS SUCH IS NOT ITS MODE OF EXISTENCE OUTSIDE THE SOUL BUT ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF PLATO THE THING UNDERSTOOD EXISTS OUTSIDE THE SOUL IN THE SAME CONDITION AS THOSE UNDER WHICH IT IS UNDERSTOOD FOR HE SUPPOSED THAT THE NATURES OF THINGS EXIST SEPARATE FROM MATTER
SECONDLY BECAUSE SINCE SOCRATES IS AN INDIVIDUAL IN A NATURE OF ONE ESSENCE COMPOSED OF MATTER AND FORM IF THE INTELLECT BE NOT THE FORM IT FOLLOWS THAT IT MUST BE OUTSIDE THE ESSENCE AND THEN THE INTELLECT IS THE WHOLE SOCRATES AS A MOTOR TO THE THING MOVED
THEREFORE AS THE SPECIES OF COLORS ARE IN THE SIGHT SO ARE THE SPECIES OF PHANTASMS IN THE POSSIBLE INTELLECT NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT BECAUSE THE COLORS THE IMAGES OF WHICH ARE IN THE SIGHT ARE ON A WALL
ONE OF WHICH CONTAINS ANOTHER AS A PENTAGON CONTAINS AND EXCEEDS A TETRAGON THUS THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL CONTAINS VIRTUALLY WHATEVER BELONGS TO THE SENSITIVE SOUL OF BRUTE ANIMALS
THIS CAN BE CLEARLY SEEN FROM COMPARISON WITH THE SENSITIVE FACULTY FROM WHICH ARISTOTLE PROCEEDS TO CONSIDER THINGS RELATING TO THE INTELLECT FOR THE RELATION OF PHANTASMS TO THE INTELLECT IS LIKE THE RELATION OF COLORS TO THE SENSE OF SIGHT
THE SAME CAN BE CLEARLY SHOWN FROM THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN SPECIES FOR THE NATURE OF EACH THING IS SHOWN BY ITS OPERATION NOW THE PROPER OPERATION OF MAN AS MAN IS TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE HE THEREBY SURPASSES ALL OTHER ANIMALS
EITHER ACCIDENTALLY IF THE FORMS ARE NOT ORDERED TO ONE ANOTHER AS WHEN WE SAY THAT SOMETHING WHITE IS SWEET OR ESSENTIALLY IN THE SECOND MANNER OF ESSENTIAL PREDICATION IF THE FORMS ARE ORDERED ONE TO ANOTHER
THERE WILL BE A LIKENESS OF THE NATURE WITHOUT THOSE THINGS WHICH MAKE IT DISTINCT AND MULTIPLIED THUS THERE WILL BE KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNIVERSAL NOR DOES IT MATTER AS TO THIS PARTICULAR POINT
THE ACTION OF SEEING IS NOT ATTRIBUTED TO THE WALL FOR WE DO NOT SAY THAT THE WALL SEES BUT RATHER THAT IT IS SEEN THEREFORE FROM THE FACT THAT THE SPECIES OF PHANTASMS ARE IN THE POSSIBLE INTELLECT IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT SOCRATES IN WHOM ARE THE PHANTASMS
THEREFORE IF WE HAVE ONE FORM BY WHICH A THING IS AN ANIMAL AND ANOTHER FORM BY WHICH IT IS A MAN IT FOLLOWS EITHER THAT ONE OF THESE TWO THINGS COULD NOT BE PREDICATED OF THE OTHER EXCEPT ACCIDENTALLY
IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT THE INTELLECT BY WHICH SOCRATES UNDERSTANDS IS A PART OF SOCRATES SO THAT IN SOME WAY IT IS UNITED TO THE BODY OF SOCRATES
FOR INSTANCE THAT WHEREBY A BODY IS PRIMARILY HEALED IS HEALTH AND THAT WHEREBY THE SOUL KNOWS PRIMARILY IS KNOWLEDGE HENCE HEALTH IS A FORM OF THE BODY AND KNOWLEDGE IS A FORM OF THE SOUL
WHEREAS THE ACT OF INTELLECT REMAINS IN THE AGENT AND DOES NOT PASS INTO SOMETHING ELSE AS DOES THE ACTION OF HEATING THEREFORE THE ACTION OF UNDERSTANDING CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO SOCRATES FOR THE REASON THAT HE IS MOVED BY HIS INTELLECT
IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS THE PROPER FORM OF MAN BUT WE MUST OBSERVE THAT THE NOBLER A FORM IS THE MORE IT RISES ABOVE CORPOREAL MATTER
THIS CAN EASILY BE EXPLAINED IF WE CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCES OF SPECIES AND FORMS FOR WE OBSERVE THAT THE SPECIES AND FORMS OF THINGS DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER AS THE PERFECT AND IMPERFECT
FURTHER EVERY FORM IS DETERMINED ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE MATTER OF WHICH IT IS THE FORM OTHERWISE NO PROPORTION WOULD BE REQUIRED BETWEEN MATTER AND FORM THEREFORE IF THE INTELLECT WERE UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
WHICH COULD NEVER BE THE CASE UNLESS THE PRINCIPLE OF ACTION WERE ESSENTIALLY ONE WE MUST THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT IN MAN THE SENSITIVE SOUL THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL AND THE NUTRITIVE SOUL ARE NUMERICALLY ONE SOUL
FURTHER WHATEVER HAS PER SE EXISTENCE IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM BECAUSE A FORM IS THAT BY WHICH A THING EXISTS SO THAT THE VERY EXISTENCE OF A FORM DOES NOT BELONG TO THE FORM BY ITSELF
EVERYTHING HAS UNITY IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT HAS BEING CONSEQUENTLY WE MUST JUDGE OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF A THING AS WE JUDGE OF ITS BEING NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL BY VIRTUE OF ITS VERY BEING IS UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
FOR AS EVERY ACTION IS ACCORDING TO THE MODE OF THE FORM BY WHICH THE AGENT ACTS AS HEATING IS ACCORDING TO THE MODE OF THE HEAT SO KNOWLEDGE IS ACCORDING TO THE MODE OF THE SPECIES BY WHICH THE KNOWER KNOWS
THE LESS IT IS MERGED IN MATTER AND THE MORE IT EXCELS MATTER BY ITS POWER AND ITS OPERATION HENCE WE FIND THAT THE FORM OF A MIXED BODY HAS ANOTHER OPERATION NOT CAUSED BY ITS ELEMENTAL QUALITIES
AND ANIMAL BY ANOTHER BUT BY ONE AND THE SAME SOUL HE IS BOTH ANIMAL AND MAN
AND HENCE THAT THE INTELLECT AND BODY FORM ONE THING SO THAT THE ACT OF THE INTELLECT COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE WHOLE THIS IS HOWEVER ABSURD FOR MANY REASONS FIRST BECAUSE THE INTELLECT DOES NOT MOVE THE BODY EXCEPT THROUGH THE APPETITE
BUT IF ANYONE SAYS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS NOT THE FORM OF THE BODY HE MUST FIRST EXPLAIN HOW IT IS THAT THIS ACTION OF UNDERSTANDING IS THE ACTION OF THIS PARTICULAR MAN FOR EACH ONE IS CONSCIOUS THAT IT IS HIMSELF WHO UNDERSTANDS
BUT THE FORM OF THE THING UNDERSTOOD IS NOT RECEIVED INTO THE INTELLECT MATERIALLY AND INDIVIDUALLY BUT RATHER IMMATERIALLY AND UNIVERSALLY
WHETHER BESIDES THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE ARE IN MAN OTHER SOULS ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT BESIDES THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE ARE IN MAN OTHER SOULS ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER
THEREFORE THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL MAY BE COMPARED TO THE BODY ANIMATED BY A SENSITIVE SOUL AS FORM TO MATTER THEREFORE IN MAN THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS NOT ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THE SENSITIVE SOUL
WE MUST THEREFORE SAY EITHER THAT SOCRATES UNDERSTANDS BY VIRTUE OF HIS WHOLE SELF AS PLATO MAINTAINED HOLDING THAT MAN IS AN INTELLECTUAL SOUL OR THAT INTELLIGENCE IS A PART OF SOCRATES THE FIRST CANNOT STAND AS WAS SHOWN ABOVE
AND AS LIFE APPEARS THROUGH VARIOUS OPERATIONS IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF LIVING THINGS THAT WHEREBY WE PRIMARILY PERFORM EACH OF ALL THESE VITAL ACTIONS IS THE SOUL FOR THE SOUL IS THE PRIMARY PRINCIPLE OF OUR NOURISHMENT SENSATION AND LOCAL MOVEMENT
WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM OBJECTION ONE IT SEEMS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM FOR THE PHILOSOPHER SAYS
SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE BY THE MANNER IN WHICH ONE THING IS PREDICATED OF ANOTHER
WHETHER IN THE BODY THERE IS ANY OTHER SUBSTANTIAL FORM FIVE OF THE QUALITIES REQUIRED IN THE BODY OF WHICH THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS THE FORM SIX
THE REASON IS BECAUSE NOTHING ACTS EXCEPT SO FAR AS IT IS IN ACT WHEREFORE A THING ACTS BY THAT WHEREBY IT IS IN ACT NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FIRST THING BY WHICH THE BODY LIVES IS THE SOUL
THE SOUL COMMUNICATES THAT EXISTENCE IN WHICH IT SUBSISTS TO THE CORPOREAL MATTER OUT OF WHICH AND THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL THERE RESULTS UNITY OF EXISTENCE SO THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE WHOLE COMPOSITE IS ALSO THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL
OTHERWISE THE OBJECTS OF SCIENCES WOULD NOT BE THINGS BUT ONLY INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES NOW IT HAPPENS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT FORMS ARE LIKENED TO THE SAME THING
SEVEN WHETHER BY MEANS OF AN ACCIDENT EIGHT WHETHER THE SOUL IS WHOLLY IN EACH PART OF THE BODY
ONE KNOWLEDGE EXISTS IN THE DISCIPLE AND ANOTHER IN THE MASTER HOW IT IS CAUSED WILL BE SHOWN LATER ON
FOR THIS REASON THAT IT IS ONE AND THE SAME MAN WHO IS CONSCIOUS BOTH THAT HE UNDERSTANDS AND THAT HE SENSES BUT ONE CANNOT SENSE WITHOUT A BODY THEREFORE THE BODY MUST BE SOME PART OF MAN
THEREFORE NEITHER IS THE INTELLECTUAL FACULTY A POWER OF THE BODY BUT VIRTUE OR POWER CANNOT BE MORE ABSTRACT OR MORE SIMPLE THAN THE ESSENCE FROM WHICH THE FACULTY OR POWER IS DERIVED THEREFORE NEITHER IS THE SUBSTANCE OF THE INTELLECT THE FORM OF A BODY
BECAUSE ANIMAL IS PREDICATED OF MAN ESSENTIALLY AND NOT ACCIDENTALLY AND MAN IS NOT PART OF THE DEFINITION OF AN ANIMAL BUT THE OTHER WAY ABOUT THEREFORE OF NECESSITY BY THE SAME FORM A THING IS ANIMAL AND MAN
WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS MULTIPLIED NUMERICALLY ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF BODIES OR IS THERE ONE INTELLIGENCE FOR ALL MEN THREE WHETHER IN THE BODY THE FORM OF WHICH IS AN INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE THERE IS SOME OTHER SOUL FOUR
BY MEANS OF INDIVIDUATING PRINCIPLES SO THAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF A THING IN GENERAL WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE BUT IF THE SPECIES BE ABSTRACTED FROM THE CONDITIONS OF INDIVIDUAL MATTER
AS IT BELONGS TO A LIGHT BODY BY REASON OF ITSELF TO BE RAISED UP AND AS A LIGHT BODY REMAINS LIGHT WHEN REMOVED FROM ITS PROPER PLACE RETAINING MEANWHILE AN APTITUDE AND AN INCLINATION FOR ITS PROPER PLACE
THEREFORE IF THE FORM WHICH IS THE MEANS OF KNOWLEDGE IS MATERIAL THAT IS NOT ABSTRACTED FROM MATERIAL CONDITIONS ITS LIKENESS TO THE NATURE OF A SPECIES OR GENUS WILL BE ACCORDING TO THE DISTINCTION AND MULTIPLICATION OF THAT NATURE
BY ONE FORM THE VEGETATIVE SOUL AND ANIMAL BY ANOTHER FORM THE SENSITIVE SOUL AND MAN BY ANOTHER FORM THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT MAN IS NOT ABSOLUTELY ONE
SUPPOSING THESE TWO FORMS NOT TO BE ORDERED TO ONE ANOTHER OR THAT ONE WOULD BE PREDICATED OF THE OTHER ACCORDING TO THE SECOND MANNER OF ESSENTIAL PREDICATION IF ONE SOUL BE PRESUPPOSED TO THE OTHER BUT BOTH OF THESE CONSEQUENCES ARE CLEARLY FALSE
BUT THE SENSITIVE SOUL IN THE HORSE THE LION AND OTHER BRUTE ANIMALS IS CORRUPTIBLE IF THEREFORE IN MAN IT BE INCORRUPTIBLE
AND TO THE NUTRITIVE SOULS OF PLANTS THEREFORE AS A SURFACE WHICH IS OF A PENTAGONAL SHAPE IS NOT TETRAGONAL BY ONE SHAPE AND PENTAGONAL BY ANOTHER SINCE A TETRAGONAL SHAPE WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS AS CONTAINED IN THE PENTAGONAL
BECAUSE EVEN IF THERE WERE BUT ONE IT WOULD NECESSARILY BE AN INDIVIDUAL INTELLECT AND THE SPECIES WHEREBY IT UNDERSTANDS AN INDIVIDUAL SPECIES
NOW AN ACTION MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANYONE IN THREE WAYS AS IS CLEAR FROM THE PHILOSOPHER
THIRDLY BECAUSE THE ACTION OF A MOTOR IS NEVER ATTRIBUTED TO THE THING MOVED EXCEPT AS TO AN INSTRUMENT AS THE ACTION OF A CARPENTER TO A SAW THEREFORE IF UNDERSTANDING IS ATTRIBUTED TO SOCRATES AS THE ACTION OF WHAT MOVES HIM
DIFFERENCE IS DERIVED FROM THE FORM BUT THE DIFFERENCE WHICH CONSTITUTES MAN IS RATIONAL WHICH IS APPLIED TO MAN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE THEREFORE THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS THE FORM OF MAN I ANSWER THAT
WHETHER THE INTELLECT BE ONE OR MANY WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD IS ONE FOR WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD IS IN THE INTELLECT NOT ACCORDING TO ITS OWN NATURE BUT ACCORDING TO ITS LIKENESS FOR THE STONE IS NOT IN THE SOUL BUT ITS LIKENESS IS
INDIVIDUALITY OF THE INTELLIGENT BEING OR OF THE SPECIES WHEREBY IT UNDERSTANDS DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE UNDERSTANDING OF UNIVERSALS OTHERWISE SINCE SEPARATE INTELLECTS ARE SUBSISTENT SUBSTANCES
THE MOVEMENT OF WHICH PRESUPPOSES THE OPERATION OF THE INTELLECT THE REASON THEREFORE WHY SOCRATES UNDERSTANDS IS NOT BECAUSE HE IS MOVED BY HIS INTELLECT BUT RATHER CONTRARIWISE HE IS MOVED BY HIS INTELLECT BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS
QUESTION SEVENTY SIX OF THE UNION OF BODY AND SOUL IN EIGHT ARTICLES
BUT BY ITS OWN ESSENCE OTHERWISE MATTER AND FORM WOULD NOT MAKE A THING SUBSTANTIALLY ONE BUT ONLY ACCIDENTALLY ONE THEREFORE A FORM CANNOT BE WITHOUT ITS OWN PROPER MATTER BUT THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE SINCE IT IS INCORRUPTIBLE
SO WHEN WE SAY THAT SOCRATES OR PLATO UNDERSTANDS IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT ATTRIBUTED TO HIM ACCIDENTALLY SINCE IT IS ASCRIBED TO HIM AS MAN WHICH IS PREDICATED OF HIM ESSENTIALLY
WE MUST ASSERT THAT THE INTELLECT WHICH IS THE PRINCIPLE OF INTELLECTUAL OPERATION IS THE FORM OF THE HUMAN BODY FOR THAT WHEREBY PRIMARILY ANYTHING ACTS IS A FORM OF THE THING TO WHICH THE ACT IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED
IT FOLLOWS THAT IT IS ATTRIBUTED TO HIM AS TO AN INSTRUMENT THIS IS CONTRARY TO THE TEACHING OF THE PHILOSOPHER WHO HOLDS THAT UNDERSTANDING IS NOT POSSIBLE THROUGH A CORPOREAL INSTRUMENT
FURTHER POWER AND ACTION HAVE THE SAME SUBJECT FOR THE SAME SUBJECT IS WHAT CAN AND DOES ACT BUT THE INTELLECTUAL ACTION IS NOT THE ACTION OF A BODY AS APPEARS FROM ABOVE
THE SENSITIVE SOUL IN MAN AND BRUTE ANIMALS WILL NOT BE OF THE SAME GENUS NOW AN ANIMAL IS SO CALLED FROM ITS HAVING A SENSITIVE SOUL AND THEREFORE ANIMAL WILL NOT BE ONE GENUS COMMON TO MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS WHICH IS ABSURD
OTHERWISE MAN WOULD NOT REALLY BE THE THING WHICH IS AN ANIMAL SO THAT ANIMAL CAN BE ESSENTIALLY PREDICATED OF MAN THIRDLY THIS IS SHOWN TO BE IMPOSSIBLE BY THE FACT THAT WHEN ONE OPERATION OF THE SOUL IS INTENSE IT IMPEDES ANOTHER
AUGUSTINE DENIES A PLURALITY OF SOULS THAT WOULD INVOLVE A PLURALITY OF SPECIES
FURTHER WHATEVER EXISTS IN A THING BY REASON OF ITS NATURE EXISTS IN IT ALWAYS BUT TO BE UNITED TO MATTER BELONGS TO THE FORM BY REASON OF ITS NATURE BECAUSE FORM IS THE ACT OF MATTER NOT BY AN ACCIDENTAL QUALITY
AND SINCE KNOWLEDGE IS BEGOTTEN ACCORDING TO THE ASSIMILATION OF THE KNOWER TO THE THING KNOWN IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SAME THING MAY HAPPEN TO BE KNOWN BY SEVERAL KNOWERS AS IS APPARENT IN REGARD TO THE SENSES FOR SEVERAL SEE THE SAME COLOR
AND CONSEQUENTLY INDIVIDUAL THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND UNIVERSALS BUT THE MATERIALITY OF THE KNOWER AND OF THE SPECIES WHEREBY IT KNOWS IMPEDES THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNIVERSAL
SINCE EVERY BODY HAS A DETERMINATE NATURE IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT THE INTELLECT HAS A DETERMINATE NATURE AND THUS IT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF KNOWING ALL THINGS AS IS CLEAR FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID
OTHERWISE THE INTELLECT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF IMMATERIAL AND UNIVERSAL OBJECTS BUT ONLY OF INDIVIDUALS LIKE THE SENSES THEREFORE THE INTELLECT IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
TWO WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE NATURE OF THE INTELLECT THEREFORE THE INTELLECT IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH OTHER NON SUBSISTENT FORMS FOR THIS REASON THE HUMAN SOUL RETAINS ITS OWN EXISTENCE AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BODY WHEREAS IT IS NOT SO WITH OTHER FORMS
THE COMMENTATOR HELD THAT THIS UNION IS THROUGH THE INTELLIGIBLE SPECIES AS HAVING A DOUBLE SUBJECT IN THE POSSIBLE INTELLECT AND IN THE PHANTASMS WHICH ARE IN THE CORPOREAL ORGANS
THAT A THING IS PERCEIVED BY THE SENSE ACCORDING TO THE DISPOSITION WHICH IT HAS OUTSIDE THE SOUL THAT IS IN ITS INDIVIDUALITY
FOR INSTANCE AS A PHYSICIAN HEALS OR BY VIRTUE OF A PART AS A MAN SEES BY HIS EYE OR THROUGH AN ACCIDENTAL QUALITY AS WHEN WE SAY THAT SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE BUILDS BECAUSE IT IS ACCIDENTAL TO THE BUILDER TO BE WHITE
THAT THE INTELLECT IS SEPARATE AND THAT IT IS NOT THE ACT OF ANY BODY THEREFORE IT IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
UNDERSTANDS BUT THAT HE OR HIS PHANTASMS ARE UNDERSTOOD SOME HOWEVER TRIED TO MAINTAIN THAT THE INTELLECT IS UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS MOTOR
THAT THE ULTIMATE HAPPINESS OF MAN MUST CONSIST IN THIS OPERATION AS PROPERLY BELONGING TO HIM MAN MUST THEREFORE DERIVE HIS SPECIES FROM THAT WHICH IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS OPERATION BUT THE SPECIES OF ANYTHING IS DERIVED FROM ITS FORM
YET AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BODY THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL RETAINS ITS OWN BEING IN LIKE MANNER THE MULTIPLICITY OF SOULS IS IN PROPORTION TO THE MULTIPLICITY OF THE BODIES YET AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BODIES THE SOULS RETAIN THEIR MULTIPLIED BEING
NOW THE HUMAN SOUL IS THE HIGHEST AND NOBLEST OF FORMS WHEREFORE IT EXCELS CORPOREAL MATTER IN ITS POWER BY THE FACT THAT IT HAS AN OPERATION AND A POWER IN WHICH CORPOREAL MATTER HAS NO SHARE WHATEVER
REMAINS SEPARATE FROM THE BODY AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BODY THEREFORE THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM ON THE CONTRARY ACCORDING TO THE PHILOSOPHER
AND LIKEWISE OF OUR UNDERSTANDING THEREFORE THIS PRINCIPLE BY WHICH WE PRIMARILY UNDERSTAND WHETHER IT BE CALLED THE INTELLECT OR THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL IS THE FORM OF THE BODY THIS IS THE DEMONSTRATION USED BY ARISTOTLE
THEREFORE IT IS NOT UNITED TO THE BODY AS ITS FORM
THE SUBJECT BELONGING TO THE DEFINITION OF THE PREDICATE AS A SURFACE IS PRESUPPOSED TO COLOR SO THAT IF WE SAY THAT A BODY WITH A SURFACE IS COLORED WE HAVE THE SECOND MANNER OF ESSENTIAL PREDICATION
AND THE HIGHER WE ADVANCE IN THE NOBILITY OF FORMS THE MORE WE FIND THAT THE POWER OF THE FORM EXCELS THE ELEMENTARY MATTER AS THE VEGETATIVE SOUL EXCELS THE FORM OF THE METAL AND THE SENSITIVE SOUL EXCELS THE VEGETATIVE SOUL
THAT THE GENUS IS TAKEN FROM THE MATTER AND DIFFERENCE FROM THE FORM BUT RATIONAL WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE CONSTITUTING MAN IS TAKEN FROM THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL WHILE HE IS CALLED ANIMAL BY REASON OF HIS HAVING A BODY ANIMATED BY A SENSITIVE SOUL
THEN A BIPED ANIMAL IS NOT ABSOLUTELY ONE FOR THIS REASON AGAINST THOSE WHO HOLD THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL SOULS IN THE BODY
WHAT CONTAINS THEM THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM ONE IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THEY ARE UNITED BY THE ONE BODY BECAUSE RATHER DOES THE SOUL CONTAIN THE BODY AND MAKE IT ONE THAN THE REVERSE
AS IN THE ORDER OF THINGS THE ANIMATE ARE MORE PERFECT THAN THE INANIMATE AND ANIMALS MORE PERFECT THAN PLANTS AND MAN THAN BRUTE ANIMALS AND IN EACH OF THESE GENERA THERE ARE VARIOUS DEGREES FOR THIS REASON ARISTOTLE
ANOTHER DAY AS AVENANT JOURNEYED HE NOTICED A RAVEN WHO WAS PURSUED BY AN EAGLE WHAT RIGHT HAS THAT EAGLE TO PERSECUTE THE RAVEN
AVENANT PITIED THE POOR THING AND PUT HER CAREFULLY BACK INTO THE WATER RECOVERING DIRECTLY THE CARP DIVED TO THE BOTTOM BUT RETURNING TO THE EDGE OF THE RIVER SAID AVENANT I THANK YOU YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE I WILL REPAY YOU
WHEN THEIR COUNTRY WAS IN A DISTURBED STATE CAME FORTH FROM THEIR RETREAT WITH THEIR SNOW CROWNED HEADS AND TOOK PART IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF AFFAIRS NOR WAS IT AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A STATESMAN WHO HAD RETIRED FROM POLITICAL SCENES TO ASSUME AGAIN A PLACE UNDER ANOTHER GOVERNMENT
POSITIVELY I MUST POSSESS THE WATER ALL WHO WASH IN IT IF THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL CONTINUE SO ALWAYS IF THEY ARE UGLY THEY BECOME BEAUTIFUL IF THEY ARE YOUNG THEY REMAIN YOUNG IF THEY ARE OLD THEY REGAIN THEIR YOUTH YOU CANNOT WONDER AVENANT
IN OCTOBER THEREFORE HE ORDERED THE GRAND CEREMONY OF MIHAKKO TO BE PERFORMED FOR THE REPOSE OF THE DEAD MEANWHILE THE RESPECT OF THE PUBLIC TOWARDS GENJI HAD NOW RETURNED TO ITS FORMER STATE
HIS PARTY CONSISTED OF MANY YOUNG NOBLES AND COURT RETAINERS BESIDES HIS OWN PRIVATE ATTENDANTS BY A COINCIDENCE THE MAIDEN OF AKASHI WHO HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM COMING TO THE TEMPLE SINCE THE LAST YEAR HAPPENED TO ARRIVE THERE ON THE SAME DAY
BUT THE PRINCESS STILL CLUNG TO THE HOPE THAT THE TIME WOULD COME WHEN GENJI WOULD REMEMBER HER AND RENEW HIS KINDNESS WINTER CAME ONE DAY QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY THE AUNT ARRIVED AT THE MANSION BRINGING AS A PRESENT A DRESS FOR THE PRINCESS
HER HEALTH HOWEVER BEGAN TO FAIL AND SHE BECAME A NUN AND AFTER SOME TIME DIED
THE NEW REIGN OPENED WITH SEVERAL CHANGES IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS GENJI HAD BEEN MADE NAIDAIJIN
IT MUST HAVE BEEN ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION AGAINST THE STATE AND THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENT TO CALL FORTH THE MILITIA TO SUPPRESS IT WAS DEPENDENT UPON AN APPLICATION FROM THE STATE FOR THAT PURPOSE
THE BOLD STAND THEN AND THEREAFTER TAKEN EXTORTED A PROMISE FROM THE EXECUTIVE AUTHORITIES THAT NO MORE TROOPS SHOULD BE SENT THROUGH THE CITY OF BALTIMORE WHICH PROMISE HOWEVER
I TELEGRAPHED TO GOVERNOR LETCHER THAT IN ADDITION TO THE FORCES HERETOFORE ORDERED REQUISITIONS HAD BEEN MADE FOR THIRTEEN REGIMENTS EIGHT TO RENDEZVOUS AT LYNCHBURG FOUR AT RICHMOND AND ONE AT HARPER'S FERRY
HE WAS ALWAYS THINKING OF HAVING SOLEMN SERVICE PERFORMED FOR HIM WHICH MIGHT PROVE TO BE A REMEDY FOR EVILS HE WAS NOW IN THE CAPITAL AND AT LIBERTY TO DO ANYTHING HE WISHED
EACH STATE AGAINST INVASION AND AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHENEVER APPLICATION SHALL HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE OR BY THE EXECUTIVE WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CAN NOT BE CONVENED AND THAT TO FAIL TO GIVE PROTECTION AGAINST ANY INVASION WHATSOEVER
THE FOURTH DAUGHTER OF UDAIJIN WAS NOW TWELVE YEARS OLD AND WAS SHORTLY EXPECTED TO BE PRESENTED AT COURT WHILE HIS SON WHO HAD SUNG THE HIGH SAND AT A SUMMER DAY REUNION AT GENJI'S MANSION RECEIVED A TITLE
ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE SAME MONTH PRESIDENT LINCOLN INTRODUCING HIS FARCE OF COMBINATIONS TOO POWERFUL TO BE SUPPRESSED BY THE ORDINARY COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS
ONLY A RAVEN FROM ABOVE FLEW AT HIS HEAD AND PECKED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYES SO VIOLENTLY THAT HE WAS BLINDED HE BEGAN STRIKING OUT ON ALL SIDES BUT AVENANT AVOIDED HIS BLOWS AND WITH HIS SWORD PIERCED HIM SO MANY TIMES THAT AT LAST HE FELL TO THE GROUND
INDUCED THE CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT TO MEET AS BEST IT MIGHT THIS ASSAULT IN THE DISCHARGE OF ITS OBLIGATION TO DEFEND EACH STATE OF THE CONFEDERACY TO THIS END THE BOMBARDMENT OF THE FORMIDABLE WORK FORT SUMTER WAS COMMENCED
AND AS HE THOUGHT OF SENDING FOR HER AS SOON AS THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG MOTHER'S HEALTH WOULD ADMIT HE HURRIED FORWARD THE REPAIRS OF THE EASTERN MANSION HE ALSO THOUGHT THAT AS THERE MIGHT NOT BE A SUITABLE NURSE AT AKASHI FOR THE CHILD
KOREMITZ RECOGNIZED HER AS AN AUNT OF THE LATTER HE THEN ASKED HER ABOUT THE PRINCESS AND TOLD HER OF GENJI'S INTENTION TO HIS INQUIRIES HE SOON OBTAINED A SATISFACTORY ANSWER
BUT GENJI TOOK NO INTEREST IN THIS WHAT WILL HE EVENTUALLY DO ABOUT THIS MATTER IN THE SAME AUTUMN GENJI WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF SUMIYOSHI TO FULFIL HIS VOWS
SO THAT SHE BECAME SADDENED AND WOULD SPEAK NO MORE
AND HENCE WHEN HE ACCEPTED HIS NEW POST HE AT ONCE SHOWED HOW CAPABLE HE WAS OF BEING A RESPONSIBLE MINISTER TO NO CHIUJIO HIS ELDEST SON WAS ALSO MADE THE GON CHIUNAGON HIS DAUGHTER BY HIS WIFE
THE MAIDEN OF AKASHI WITNESSED THE PROCESSION BUT SHE AVOIDED MAKING HERSELF KNOWN SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD BETTER NOT GO UP TO THE TEMPLE ON THAT DAY BUT SHE COULD NOT SAIL BACK TO AKASHI
A LIBERAL ALLOWANCE WAS GRANTED TO HER AND A BECOMING HOUSEHOLD WAS ESTABLISHED FOR HER PRIVATE USE SHE HOWEVER STILL CONTINUED HER DEVOTION TO RELIGION NOW AND THEN COMING TO COURT TO SEE HER SON WHERE SHE WAS RECEIVED WITH ALL CORDIALITY SO THAT HER RIVAL
THEY JOURNEYED ON UNTIL THEY CAME TO A ROCK BLACK AS INK FROM WHICH SMOKE WAS ISSUING AND A MOMENT LATER THERE APPEARED ONE OF THE DRAGONS BELCHING FORTH FIRE FROM HIS EYES AND MOUTH HE WAS A FRIGHTFUL LOOKING CREATURE WITH A GREEN AND YELLOW BODY
THANKING HER A THOUSAND TIMES AVENANT GOING AT ONCE TO THE PALACE SAID PRINCESS YOUR COMMAND IS FULFILLED MAY IT PLEASE YOU TO RECEIVE THE KING MY MASTER AS YOUR HUSBAND THE PRINCESS THOUGHT SHE MUST BE DREAMING WHEN SHE SAW THE RING BUT SHE SET AVENANT ANOTHER TASK
THE TIME HAS NOW COME GIVE ME YOUR FLASK I WILL BRING YOU THE WATER OF BEAUTY AND CARRYING THE FLASK THE OWL ENTERED THE GROTTO UNHINDERED RETURNING IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WITH IT FULL TO THE BRIM AVENANT THANKED THE OWL HEARTILY AND JOYOUSLY STARTED FOR THE TOWN
MY DEAR MASTER DO NOT DESPAIR YOU ARE TOO GOOD TO BE UNHAPPY EARLY TO MORROW MORNING LET US GO TO THE RIVER SIDE AVENANT PATTED HIM BUT DID NOT ANSWER AND STILL SAD FELL ASLEEP
THAT ALSO SEEMS NATURAL
MY DAYS ARE ENDED I CAN NEVER OBTAIN THAT WATER THE DRAGONS ARE GUARDING WHEN I AM DEAD FILL THIS FLASK WITH MY BLOOD AND CARRY IT TO THE PRINCESS THAT SHE MAY KNOW WHAT IT HAS COST ME THEN GO TO THE KING MY MASTER AND TELL HIM OF MY MISFORTUNE
WHEN HE REFLECTED ON THIS PREDICTION AND ON THE SERIES OF EVENTS
A HANDSOME YOUNG KING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS PRINCESS FELL SO DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH HER FROM WHAT HE HAD HEARD
LOCAL GOVERNORS WHO HAD BECOME RICH AND HAVING RETURNED FROM DIFFERENT PROVINCES SOUNDED THE PRINCESS TO SEE IF SHE WERE INCLINED TO PART WITH HER RESIDENCE BUT THIS SHE ALWAYS REFUSED TO DO SAYING THAT HOWEVER UNFORTUNATE SHE MIGHT BE
I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN HOW YOU RESCUED ME FROM THE EAGLE
BUT SUCH PEOPLE APPEARED ONLY CONTEMPTIBLE TO HER AS SHE LOOKED UPON THEM AS PROPOSING SUCH A THING SOLELY BECAUSE THEY KNEW SHE WAS POOR HER ATTENDANTS SOMETIMES SUGGESTED TO HER THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE FOR ONE TO DISPOSE OF SUCH ARTICLES
SHORTLY BEFORE HE ARRIVED AT HIS DESTINATION PURCHASING A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE DOG NAMED CABRIOLE WHEN AVENANT REACHED THE PALACE OF THE PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR AND SAW THE PRINCESS SEATED UPON HER THRONE
OR THE UDAIJIN HE WAS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN THE ADMINISTRATION BUT AS HE WAS NOT YET DISPOSED TO ENGAGE IN THE BUSY CARES OF OFFICIAL LIFE
AND AS YON BEACON MEETS OUR EYE TO DREAM PERCHANCE OF DAYS GONE BY A FEW WORDS MORE THE CHANGE OF THE RULER HAD BROUGHT A CHANGE OF THE SAIGU AND THE LADY OF ROKJIO WITH HER DAUGHTER RETURNED TO THE CAPITAL
AND THE USURPATION OF UNDELEGATED POWER OR IN OTHER WORDS OF POWER RESERVED TO THE STATES OR TO THE PEOPLE IT MIGHT THEREFORE HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED THAT VIRGINIA ONE OF WHOSE SONS WROTE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
THESE WORDS TOUCHED THE PRINCESS BUT SHE GAVE NO VENT TO HER FEELINGS THE VISITOR THEREFORE HURRIED JIJIU TO GET READY SAYING THAT THEY MUST LEAVE BEFORE THE DUSK
WHICH HAD BEEN PLEADING FOR PEACE AND STILL STOOD ON THE DEFENSIVE
BUT THE LIQUID IN THIS FLASK WAS REALLY THAT WHICH WAS USED WHEN THE PRINCES OR GREAT LORDS WERE CONDEMNED TO DEATH FOR INSTEAD OF BEING BEHEADED THEIR FACES WERE WASHED WITH THIS WATER AND THEY FELL ASLEEP AND DID NOT WAKE AGAIN AND
THE ATTRACTIONS OF THE MOTHER SEEM ONLY TO HAVE ARISEN FROM THE POSITION IN WHICH SHE WAS PLACED YOU MUST NOT THINK OF THE MATTER TOO SERIOUSLY
ONLY I HEARD NOTHING FROM YOU SO I WAITED TILL NOW AND HERE I FIND MYSELF ONCE MORE THE PRINCESS AS USUAL SAID VERY LITTLE ONLY THANKING HIM FOR HIS VISIT HE THEN ADDRESSED HER IN MANY KIND AND AFFECTIONATE WORDS
THEY WANDERED DOWN TO THE RIVER AND THERE AVENANT HEARD A VOICE CALLING HIM AND WHAT SHOULD HE SEE BUT THE GOLDEN CARP WITH THE PRINCESS'S RING IN HER MOUTH
KOREMITZ ENTERED AND PROCEEDING TO THE DOOR CALLED OUT
WHERE THERE WAS NO EXPECTATION THE CHILD IS MERELY A GIRL TOO AND I ALMOST THINK THAT I NEED PAY NO FURTHER ATTENTION BUT THIS WOULD MAKE ME HEARTLESS TOWARDS MY UNDOUBTED OFFSPRING I SHALL SEND FOR IT AND SHOW IT TO YOU AND HOPE YOU WILL BE GENEROUS TO HER
PRAY DON'T ATTRIBUTE ANY BLAME TO ME I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT HOW MISERABLE AM I AND HE BEGAN TO DROP TEARS WHEN HE CAME TO REFLECT HOW FAITHFUL SHE HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME AND HOW AFFECTIONATE AND ALSO HOW REGULAR HAD BEEN HER CORRESPONDENCE
THE MOTHER OF THE EX EMPEROR WHOSE INFLUENCE WAS OVERWHELMING TILL LATELY NOW BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE ONE TO WHOM THE WORLD HAD BECOME IRKSOME IN THE MEANTIME PUBLIC AFFAIRS ENTIRELY CHANGED THEIR ASPECTS
AND HIS TAIL WAS SO LONG THAT IT WENT INTO A HUNDRED CURVES AVENANT SAW ALL THIS BUT RESOLVED TO DIE HE DREW HIS SWORD AND CARRYING THE FLASK THE PRINCESS HAD GIVEN TO HIM TO HOLD THE WATER HE SAID TO CABRIOLE
AGREED THAT THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE AND MILITARY OPERATIONS OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE OF SAID COMMONWEALTH IN THE IMPENDING CONFLICT WITH THE UNITED STATES
THAT THE CALLING ON SOME OF THE STATES FOR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILITIA TO INVADE OTHER STATES WHICH WERE ASSERTED TO BE STILL IN THE UNION WAS A PALPABLE VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION
SO THE KING USING THIS WATER ONE EVENING THINKING IT TO BE THE BEAUTY WATER AND HOPING AND EXPECTING TO BE MADE MORE HANDSOME WENT TO SLEEP AND AWOKE NO MORE
I WOULD FAIN DESCRIBE THE ASTONISHMENT OF HER AUNT WHEN SHE RETURNED FROM THE WESTERN ISLAND AND SAW THE PRINCESS'S HAPPY CONDITION AND HOW JIJIU REGRETTED HAVING LEFT HER TOO HASTILY
WAS VERY TRYING TO THE PRINCESS WHO SAID TO HER THAT THOUGH SHE COULD NOT BLAME HER FOR LEAVING SHE STILL FELT SORRY TO LOSE HER TO THIS JIJIU REPLIED THAT SHE NEVER FORGOT THE WISHES OF HER MOTHER AND WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY TO SHARE JOY AND SORROW WITH THE PRINCESS
IT IS NOT MY WISH TO LEAVE YOU BEHIND BUT YOU WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ME AND NOW THERE IS NO HELP BUT THIS ONE THIS JIJIU AT LEAST I WISH TO TAKE WITH ME I HAVE COME TO DAY TO FETCH HER I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN BE CONTENT WITH YOUR PRESENT CONDITION
WHEN SHE ARRIVED THE PRIEST WAS INTENSELY DELIGHTED AND THE YOUNG MOTHER WHO HAD BEEN GRADUALLY IMPROVING IN HEALTH FELT GREAT CONSOLATION THE CHILD WAS VERY HEALTHY AND THE NURSE AT ONCE BEGAN TO DISCHARGE HER DUTIES MOST FAITHFULLY
AND WHICH HAD FORMERLY BELONGED TO HIS FATHER THIS HE DID WITH A NOTION OF PLACING THERE SOME OF HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS
AND FOR THIS REASON SHE WAS NOT VERY FRIENDLY WITH THE FAMILY
BUT HE WAS A MAN OF ECCENTRIC CHARACTER AND WAS NOT VERY FLOURISHING IN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH BEING THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WITH THE PRINCESS HITACHI THE GROUNDS OF HER MANSION BECAME MORE AND MORE DESOLATE AND WILD
LEFT THE UNITED STATES CAPITAL TO REPORT THE RESULT OF THEIR MISSION TO THE CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT THE NOTICE RECEIVED THAT AN ARMED EXPEDITION HAD SAILED FOR OPERATIONS AGAINST THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE HARBOR OF CHARLESTON
HERE SHE MANIFESTED A CERTAIN SADNESS BUT HER DELIGHT AT HER HUSBAND'S PROMOTION WAS UNMISTAKABLE AND SHE CONTINUED WHEN YOUR FATHER WAS ALIVE I WAS LOOKED DOWN UPON BY HIM WHICH CAUSED A COOLNESS BETWEEN US
HE AT FIRST DECLINED TO ACCEPT THE OFFICE ON THE GROUND THAT HE WAS ADVANCED IN AGE THAT HE HAD ALREADY RETIRED FROM OFFICIAL LIFE AND THAT THE DECLINE OF HIS LIFE LEFT HIM INSUFFICIENT ENERGY THERE WAS HOWEVER AN EXAMPLE IN A FOREIGN STATE
THEN THE ENVIOUS COURTIERS COUNSELLED THE KING AND AVENANT WAS CAST ONCE MORE INTO THE TOWER CHAINED HAND AND FOOT WHEN PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR HEARD OF THIS IMPRISONMENT SHE FELL ON HER KNEES BEFORE THE KING
IF YOU FEEL ANY UNPLEASANTNESS ABOUT THE MATTER I CANNOT BLAME YOU IN ANY WAY IT WAS NOT THE BLESSING WHICH I DESIRED HOW GREATLY DO I REGRET THAT IN THE QUARTER WHERE I WISHED TO SEE THE HEAVENLY GIFT THERE IS NONE BUT SEE IT IN ANOTHER
CALLED FORTH THE MILITARY OF THE SEVERAL STATES TO THE NUMBER OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND COMMANDED THE PERSONS COMPOSING THE COMBINATIONS TO DISPERSE ET CETERA IT CAN BUT SURPRISE ANY ONE IN THE LEAST DEGREE CONVERSANT WITH THE HISTORY OF THE UNION
BUT IT IS SIMPLY FOOLISH TO ABANDON ONE'S SELF AND TO BURY ONE'S LIFE UNDER SUCH A MASS OF DILAPIDATION
FOR THE NIGHT AS TO GENJI HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE MAIDEN BEING A SPECTATOR OF THE PROCESSION AND SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT IN THE TEMPLE WITH HIS PARTY IN PERFORMING SERVICES WHICH MIGHT PLEASE THE GOD
WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN SMALL SO SMALL WITH MY TEETH I WILL CRUSH THEM ALL ON SO MANY WOULD I FEED FEED FEED THE WHOLE WORLD CAN'T SUPPLY MY NEED
WHICH MADE ME ABSTAIN FROM VISITING YOU OFTEN BUT FORTUNE IS FICKLE FOR THOSE IN A HUMBLE POSITION OFTEN ENJOY COMFORT AND THOSE THAT ARE HIGHER IN STATION ARE NOT QUITE SO WELL CIRCUMSTANCED I DO REALLY FEEL SORRY TO LEAVE YOU BEHIND
WHO WAS BY NO MEANS DISTINGUISHED FOR HER BEAUTY AND WHO STILL BORE A MARK ON HER NOSE WHICH MIGHT REMIND ONE OF A WELL RIPENED FRUIT CARRIED BY MOUNTAINEERS HOW WAS THIS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREORDAINED TO BE SO
HE IS A GIANT TALLER THAN MY HIGHEST TOWER HE EATS A MAN AS A MONKEY WOULD EAT A CHESTNUT AND WHEN HE SPEAKS HIS VOICE IS SO LOUD THAT IT DEAFENS THOSE WHO HEAR HIM HE WILL NOT TAKE MY REFUSAL BUT KILLS MY SUBJECTS
TO SEND TO HER TROOPS ORGANIZED AND EQUIPPED
TO THIS THE PRINCESS REPLIED MOST GRACIOUSLY SAYING THAT HIS PETITION MOVED HER MORE THAN ANY OTHER COULD DO BUT KNOW SHE ADDED AS I WAS WALKING BY THE RIVER A MONTH AGO AS I TOOK OFF MY GLOVE A RING THAT I GREATLY VALUE FELL INTO THE WATER
AND ANOTHER OF WHOSE SONS MAINLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNION WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SLOW IN THE FACE OF SUCH EVENTS TO RECLAIM THE GRANTS SHE HAD MADE TO THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT
I HOPE YOU WILL NO MORE REFUSE THE KING MY MASTER
AND KOREMITZ IN FINE UNIFORMS OF DIFFERENT COLORS BLUE GREEN OR SCARLET ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT RANKS FORMED THE PROCESSION CONTRASTING WITH THE HUE OF THE RANGE OF PINE TREES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHERE A LADY OF ORDINARY DEGREE IS ELEVATED TO A HIGHER POSITION
TWO DAYS HAD ELAPSED BETWEEN THE SURRENDER OF FORT SUMTER AND THE PROCLAMATION OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN CALLING FOR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILITIA AS BEFORE STATED
SENIOR SECRETARY TO THE LORD LIEUTENANT AND THEY WERE TO GO DOWN TO TZKUSHI
ALLOWING THEM TO BECOME THE ORNAMENT OF THE DWELLINGS OF SOME LOWBORN UPSTARTS SCARCELY ANYONE PAID A VISIT TO HER DWELLING HER ONLY OCCASIONAL VISITOR BEING HER BROTHER A PRIEST WHO CAME TO SEE HER WHEN HE CAME TO THE CAPITAL
THESE WITH THEIR ILLUSTRATIONS WERE HER CHIEF RESOURCES NOW A SISTER OF THE PRINCESS'S MOTHER HAD MARRIED A DURIO AND HAD ALREADY BORNE HIM A DAUGHTER THIS MARRIAGE HAD BEEN CONSIDERED AN UNEQUAL MATCH BY THE FATHER OF THE PRINCESS
HE DESPATCHED A MESSENGER THERE ON THE FIRST OF MARCH AS HE DEEMED THE HAPPY EVENT WOULD TAKE PLACE ABOUT THAT TIME WHEN THE MESSENGER RETURNED HE REPORTED THAT SHE WAS SAFELY DELIVERED OF A GIRL ON THE SIXTEENTH OF THE MONTH
NOTICE OF AN ARMED EXPEDITION ACTION OF THE CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT BOMBARDMENT AND SURRENDER OF FORT SUMTER ITS REDUCTION REQUIRED BY THE EXIGENCY OF THE CASE DISGUISE THROWN OFF
HAD ALL RECEIVED A SATISFACTORY TOKEN OF APPRECIATION FROM GENJI WHO NOW BEGAN TO HAVE A MANSION REPAIRED
SHE LOOKED SO LOVELY THAT AT FIRST ALL HIS FINE SPEECHES FORSOOK HIM AND HE COULD NOT UTTER A WORD HOWEVER TAKING COURAGE HE ADDRESSED HER IN EXQUISITELY CHOSEN LANGUAGE BEGGING HER TO BECOME THE KING'S BRIDE
GENJI TRIED TO CONSOLE HER HE TOOK UP A KIN AND ASKED HER TO PLAY AND SING WITH HIM BUT SHE DID NOT TOUCH IT SAYING THAT SHE COULD NOT PLAY IT SO WELL AS THE MAIDEN OF AKASHI
NOT FAR FROM HERE THERE IS A PRINCE NAMED GALIFRON SAID SHE
AND WHO STILL REMAINED WITH THE PRINCESS USED TO GO TO HER
TO FIND STATES REFERRED TO AS PERSONS COMPOSING COMBINATIONS AND THAT THE SOVEREIGN CREATORS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATES OF THE UNION SHOULD BE COMMANDED BY THEIR AGENT TO DISPERSE THE LEVY OF SO LARGE AN ARMY COULD ONLY MEAN WAR
THE EVENT HOWEVER WAS SEIZED UPON TO INFLAME THE MIND OF THE NORTHERN PEOPLE AND THE DISGUISE WHICH HAD BEEN WORN IN THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CONFEDERATE COMMISSIONERS WAS NOW THROWN OFF AND IT WAS CUNNINGLY ATTEMPTED TO SHOW THAT THE SOUTH
AND HE HIMSELF HAD BECOME A DISTINGUISHED PERSONAGE IN THE CAPITAL THE EMPRESS MOTHER THOUGH INDISPOSED REGRETTED SHE HAD NOT RUINED GENJI ALTOGETHER WHILE THE EMPEROR WHO HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE INJUNCTION OF THE LATE EX EMPEROR
HER CARRIAGE DASHED INTO THE GARDEN IN A MOST POMPOUS STYLE AND DROVE RIGHT UP TO THE SOUTHERN FRONT OF THE BUILDING JIJIU WENT TO MEET HER AND CONDUCTED HER INTO THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT I MUST SOON BE LEAVING THE CAPITAL SAID THE VISITOR
CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE BEACON GENJI WELL REMEMBERED THE DREAM WHICH HE HAD DREAMT AT SUMA AND IN WHICH HIS FATHER THE LATE EX EMPEROR HAD MADE A FAINT ALLUSION TO HIS FALLEN STATE
THAT KNIGHTLY SOLDIER GENERAL BONHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA WENT WITH HIS BRIGADE TO RICHMOND AND THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHERN STATES THERE WAS A PREVAILING DESIRE TO RUSH TO VIRGINIA
ALL HIS OLD FAVORITES BEING NOW ABANDONED HOW THEN CAN YOU EXPECT HIM TO SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN FAITHFUL TO HIM
BUT THERE ARE OTHER WOMEN WHO WHEN DEGRADED FROM THEIR RANK SPOIL THEIR TASTE AND HABITS JUST LIKE THE LADY IN QUESTION
YET SHE WAS SORRY TO SAY THAT CIRCUMSTANCES OBLIGED HER TO LEAVE HER FOR SOME TIME BUT BEFORE SHE COULD SAY MUCH SHE WAS HURRIED AWAY BY THE VISITOR IT WAS ONE EVENING IN APRIL OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR THAT GENJI HAPPENED TO BE GOING TO THE VILLA OF THE FALLING FLOWERS
AND PLACING A CROWN OF GOLD UPON HIS HEAD AND A ROYAL MANTLE UPON HIS SHOULDERS SAID COME DEAR AVENANT I WILL MAKE YOU KING
AT THE ENTRANCE THERE ARE TWO DRAGONS WITH FIRE IN THEIR EYES AND MOUTHS INSIDE THE GROTTO THERE IS A DEEP PIT INTO WHICH YOU MUST DESCEND IT IS FULL OF TOADS SCORPIONS AND SERPENTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PIT THERE IS A LITTLE CAVE WHERE FLOWS THE FOUNTAIN OF BEAUTY AND HEALTH
PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S CALL FOR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN HIS FICTION OF COMBINATIONS PALPABLE VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION ACTION OF VIRGINIA OF CITIZENS OF BALTIMORE
HE DID NOT HOWEVER BELIEVE HE SHOULD BE LONG ON THE THRONE AND WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF LONELY HE OFTEN SENT FOR GENJI AND SPENT HOURS CONVERSING WITH HIM WITHOUT ANY RESERVE ON PUBLIC AFFAIRS
GENJI WAS IN A CARRIAGE WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY TEN BOY PAGES GRANTED BY THE COURT IN THE SAME WAY AS A LATE SADAIJIN KAWARA HAD BEEN HONORED
THE YOUNG GENJI TOO THE SON OF THE LATE LADY AOI WAS ADMITTED TO THE COURT OF THE EMPEROR AND OF THE HEIR APPARENT THE ATTENDANTS WHO FAITHFULLY SERVED THE YOUNG GENJI AND THOSE IN THE MANSION AT NIJIO
OF THE UNITED STATES IS BUT TO REPEAT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ON THE ABSENCE OF ANY AUTHORITY IN THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT TO COERCE A STATE IN ANY POSSIBLE VIEW OF THE CASE THEREFORE THE CONCLUSION MUST BE
WAS ONLY OBSERVED UNTIL BY ARTIFICE POWER HAD BEEN GAINED TO DISREGARD IT VIRGINIA AS HAS BEEN HERETOFORE STATED PASSED HER ORDINANCE OF SECESSION ON THE SEVENTEENTH OF APRIL
MADE OF THE HAIR WHICH HAD FALLEN FROM HER OWN HEAD THIS SHE PUT INTO AN OLD CASKET
BUT IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT THE THREATS IMPLIED IN THE DECLARATIONS THAT THE UNION COULD NOT EXIST PART SLAVE AND PART FREE AND THAT THE UNION SHOULD BE PRESERVED
RESPONDED AVENANT AS HOLDING GALIFRON'S HEAD HE RODE OFF WHEN HE ENTERED THE TOWN CROWDS FOLLOWED HIM CRYING HERE IS THE BRAVE AVENANT WHO HAS SLAIN THE MONSTER AVENANT ADVANCED TO THE PRINCESS AND SAID MADAM YOUR ENEMY IS DEAD
IT WAS HOWEVER SUBJECT TO RATIFICATION BY THE PEOPLE AT AN ELECTION TO BE HELD ON THE FOURTH THURSDAY OF MAY SHE WAS IN THE MEAN TIME LIKE HER SOUTHERN SISTERS THE OBJECT OF NORTHERN HOSTILITIES AND HAVING A COMMON CAUSE WITH THEM
NOW AT HIS COURT THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN CALLED AVENANT HE WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE SUN AND A MORE FINELY MADE FELLOW THAN ANY IN THE KINGDOM EVERYBODY LOVED HIM EXCEPT A FEW ENVIOUS PEOPLE
AND CARRIED AWAY PART OF THE SHINGLE ROOF ONLY ONE BLESSING REMAINED THERE NO THIEF INTRUDED INTO THE ENCLOSURE AS NO TEMPTATION WAS OFFERED TO THEM FOR THEIR ATTACK BUT NEVER DID THE PRINCESS LOSE HER ACCUSTOMED RESERVE
AND THESE WORDS WERE REPEATED TO THE KING IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY MADE HIM VERY ANGRY AND HE ORDERED AVENANT TO BE SHUT UP IN A HIGH TOWER TO DIE OF HUNGER IN THIS SAD PLIGHT AVENANT EXCLAIMED ONE DAY HOW HAVE I OFFENDED HIS MAJESTY
THAT I WILL NOT LEAVE MY KINGDOM WITHOUT TAKING IT WITH ME
AND DULY REPORTED IT TO GENJI WHO NOW FELT A PANG OF REMORSE FOR HIS LONG NEGLIGENCE OF ONE SO BADLY CIRCUMSTANCED HE DESCENDED FROM HIS CARRIAGE BUT THE PATHWAY WAS ALL BUT OVERGROWN WITH TALL MUGWORT WHICH WAS WET WITH A PASSING SHOWER
HE FELT SORRY FOR HER AND CONTINUED IN MY ANXIOUS THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS CHILD I HAVE SOME INTENTIONS WHICH MAY BE AGREEABLE TO YOU ALSO ONLY I WILL NOT TELL YOU TOO HASTILY SINCE IF I DO SO NOW THEY MIGHT NOT BE TAKEN IN A FAVORABLE LIGHT
AND THE DENIAL OF THE RIGHT OF A STATE PEACEABLY TO WITHDRAW WERE VIRTUALLY A DECLARATION OF WAR AND THE SENDING OF AN ARMY AND NAVY TO ATTACK WAS THE RESULT TO HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH DECLARATION OF WAR
WHO ASKED HIM TO GO TO THE PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR AND BESEECH HER TO REMEMBER THE POOR PRISONER
HE REMEMBERED THE PREDICTION OF AN ASTROLOGER WHO HAD TOLD HIM THAT AN EMPEROR WOULD BE BORN TO HIM AND ANOTHER SON WHO WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME A DAJIODAIJIN HE ALSO REMEMBERED THAT A DAUGHTER
HE THEN BRIEFLY SKETCHED HER CHARACTER AND HER SKILL IN MUSIC BUT ON THE PART OF VIOLET SHE COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT IT WAS CRUEL TO HER TO GIVE AWAY PART OF HIS HEART WHILE HER THOUGHTS WERE WITH NO ONE BUT HIM AND SHE WAS QUITE CAST DOWN FOR SOME TIME
HITHERTO GENJI DID NOT CONFIDE THE STORY OF HIS RELATIONS WITH THE MAIDEN OF AKASHI TO VIOLET BUT HE THOUGHT HE HAD BETTER DO SO AS THE MATTER MIGHT NATURALLY REACH HER EARS HE NOW THEREFORE INFORMED HER OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND OF THE BIRTH OF THE CHILD SAYING
AVENANT SET OUT FOR GALIFRON'S COUNTRY ASKING NEWS OF THE GIANT AS HE WENT ALONG AND THE MORE HE HEARD THE MORE HE FEARED HIM
WHICH WAS RATIFIED BY THE CONVENTION ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF APRIL THE CONVENTION FOR THAT ALLIANCE SET FORTH THAT VIRGINIA LOOKING TO A SPEEDY UNION WITH THE CONFEDERATE STATES
FELT SATISFIED WITH HIS RECENT DISPOSITION TOWARDS HIS HALF BROTHER WHICH HE BELIEVED TO BE AN ACT OF GOODNESS THIS HE FELT THE MORE
THE FIFTH OF MAY WAS THE FIFTIETH DAY OF THE BIRTH OF THE CHILD SO GENJI SENT A MESSENGER TO AKASHI A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE TIME WHEN HE WOULD BE EXPECTED
AND HIS SON IN LAW GENJI BY WHOSE INFLUENCE ALL THINGS IN PUBLIC WERE SWAYED IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR THE DAUGHTER OF GON CHIUNAGON FORMERLY TO NO CHIUJIO WAS INTRODUCED AT COURT SHE TOOK UP HER ABODE IN THE KOKIDEN
WHERE HE PRESENTED THE FLASK TO THE PRINCESS WHO IMMEDIATELY GAVE ORDERS TO PREPARE FOR HER DEPARTURE BUT AS SHE CONSIDERED AVENANT ALTOGETHER CHARMING BEFORE SHE SET OUT SHE SEVERAL TIMES SAID TO HIM IF YOU WISH WE NEED NOT GO FOR I WILL MAKE YOU KING OF MY COUNTRY
I THINK IF SHAKESPEARE COULD WRITE AN ARTICLE FOR THE LADIES HOME JOURNAL ON WOMEN WHO HAVE HELPED ME AND TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH AS NO MAN EVER WILL IN PRINT HE WOULD PUT ANN HATHAWAY FIRST
NO DOUBT KENILWORTH WAS STUPENDOUS IN ITS MAGNIFICENCE AND IT WILL PAY YOU TO TAKE DOWN FROM ITS SHELF SIR WALTER'S NOVEL AND READ ABOUT IT BUT TODAY IT IS ALL A CRUMBLING HEAP IVY ROOKS AND DAWS HOLD THE PLACE IN FEE
WHEN THE CHARLCOTE MANSION WAS BUILT THERE WAS A HOUSEWARMING AND GOOD QUEEN BESS WHO WAS NOT SO AWFUL GOOD CAME IN GREAT STATE SO WE SEE THAT SHE HAD VARIOUS CALLING ACQUAINTANCES IN THESE PARTS
WHICH IS THE RESPIRATION OF GOD THROUGH MAN WHAT EDIFICE CAN EQUAL THOUGHT BABEL IS LESS LOFTY THAN ISAIAH CHEOPS IS SMALLER THAN HOMER THE COLOSSEUM IS INFERIOR TO JUVENAL
ANYWAY I HAVE CEASED TO KICK AGAINST THE PRICKS AND NOW MEEKLY ACCEPT MY FATE LEAMINGTON SEEMS LARGELY UNDER SUBJECTION TO THAT TRIUMVIRATE OF DESPOTS THE BUTLER THE COACHMAN AND THE GARDENER
I SENT A SHRILL WHISTLE AND A STICK THAT WAY AND OUT RAN FOUR FINE DEER THAT LOPED GRACEFULLY ACROSS THE TURF THE SIGHT BROUGHT MY POACHER INSTINCTS TO THE SURFACE BUT I BOTTLED THEM AND TRUDGED ON UNTIL I CAME TO THE LITTLE CHURCH THAT STANDS AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE PARK
IN FIFTEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE WHEN SHAKESPEARE WAS ELEVEN YEARS OF AGE QUEEN ELIZABETH CAME TO KENILWORTH WHETHER HER TICKET WAS BY WAY OF LEAMINGTON I DO NOT KNOW BUT SHE REMAINED FROM JULY NINTH TO JULY TWENTY SEVENTH
YES I MUST BE TRUTHFUL IT IS A BIG BREWERY AND THERE ARE FOUR BIG BULLDOGS IN THE COURTWAY AND THERE ARE BIG VATS AND BIG WORKMEN IN BIG APRONS AND EACH OF THESE WORKMEN IS ALLOWED TO DRINK SIX QUARTS OF BEER EACH DAY WITHOUT CHARGE
IN FACT IN MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM HE HAS CALLED ON HIS MEMORY FOR CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SHOW ELIZABETH WAS FORTY ONE YEARS OLD THEN BUT APPARENTLY VERY ATTRACTIVE AND GLIB OF TONGUE
I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS VERY PROBABLE THAT JUDITH COULD WRITE BUT THAT SHE AFFIXED HER NAME THUS IN MERRY JEST JOHN SHAKESPEARE COULD NOT WRITE WE HAVE NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT ANN HATHAWAY COULD
ONE OF THESE MONUMENTS IS TO COMMEMORATE A CALAMITY THE CONFLAGRATION OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX AND THE OTHERS ARE IN HONOR OF DEEDS OF WAR
PHILANTHROPISTS HAVE WON ALL BY GIVING MONEY BUT WHO SAVE QUINEY HAS REAPED IMMORTALITY BY ASKING FOR IT THE INSCRIPTION OVER SHAKESPEARE'S GRAVE IS AN OFFER OF REWARD IF YOU DO AND A THREAT OF PUNISHMENT IF YOU DON'T ALL IN CHOICE DOGGEREL
TO HELP PRESERVE INVIOLATE THE MEMORY OF HER ONE SON TO WHOM THE WORLD UNCOVERS VICTOR HUGO HAS SAID SOMETHING ON THIS SUBJECT WHICH RUNS ABOUT LIKE THIS WHY A MONUMENT TO SHAKESPEARE
BUT HE SAW THEM AS A COUNTRYMAN WHO CAME ON CERTAIN FETE DAYS AND STARED WITH OPEN MOUTH WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE HE HAS COVERED ALL WITH THE GLAMOUR OF HIS RICH BOYISH IMAGINATION
SOME HASTY INDIVIDUAL HAS PUT FORTH A STATEMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT POETS CAN ONLY BE BRED IN A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY WHERE THEY COULD LIFT UP THEIR EYES TO THE HILLS ROCK AND RAVINE BEETLING CRAG SINGING CASCADE
WHY DID HE NOT LEARN AT THE FEET OF SIR THOMAS LUCY AND WRITE HIS OWN EPITAPH BUT I RATHER GUESS I KNOW WHY HIS GRAVE WAS NOT MARKED WITH HIS NAME HE WAS A PLAY ACTOR AND THE CHURCH PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTRAGED AT THE THOUGHT OF BURYING A STROLLING PLAYER IN THAT SACRED CHANCEL
WHEN HE PICTURES MACBETH'S CASTLE HE HAS WARWICK IN HIS INWARD EYE THIS CASTLE HATH A PLEASANT SEAT THE AIR NIMBLY AND SWEETLY RECOMMENDS ITSELF UNTO OUR GENTLE SENSES
AND FROM HIS BRAIN THE DAZZLING PICTURES WOULD HAVE FLED YET HIS FANCIES SERVE US BETTER THAN THE FACTS SHAKESPEARE SHOWS US MANY CASTLES
OR TO DANCE THE RACQUET BUT THE TRAM IS AT THE DOOR THE OUTSIDE FARE IS A PENNY INSIDE IT'S TWO AND WE ARE SOON SAFE
THE FIRST GLIMPSE WE GET OF STRATFORD IS THE SPIRE OF HOLY TRINITY THEN COMES THE TOWER OF THE NEW MEMORIAL THEATER WHICH BY THE WAY IS EXACTLY LIKE THE CITY HALL AT DEAD HORSE COLORADO
YOU HEAR THE JINGLE OF KEYS THE FLICK OF THE WHIP AND THE RATTLE OF THE LAWNMOWER AND A COLD SECRET FEAR TAKES POSSESSION OF YOU A SORT OF HALF FRENZIED IMPULSE TO FLEE BEFORE SMUG MODERNITY TAKES YOU CAPTIVE AND WHISKS YOU OFF TO PLAY TIDDLEDYWINKS
WHILE SOME WHITE HAIRED OLD PATRIARCH WOULD GREET ME AND GIVE A LITTLE LECTURE TO THE ASSEMBLED PILGRIMS ON THE GREAT MAN WHOSE FOOTSTEPS HAD MADE SACRED THE SOIL BENEATH OUR FEET
WHAT MOON COULD SHED ABOUT THE PILE A LIGHT MORE MYSTIC THAN THAT OF A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM WHAT CAPITAL WERE IT EVEN IN LONDON COULD RUMBLE AROUND IT AS TUMULTUOUSLY AS MACBETH'S PERTURBED SOUL
WHETHER HE WAS ACCOMMODATED WE CAN NOT SAY AND IF HE WAS DID HE PAY IT BACK IS A QUESTION THAT HAS CAUSED MUCH HOT DEBATE BUT IT IS WORTHY OF NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH CONSIDERABLE DOUBT AS TO AUTHENTICITY HAS SMOOCHED THE OTHER SHAKESPEARIAN RELICS
YET THE FACT OF THE POET HAVING BEEN STRUCK FOR A LOAN BY RICHARD QUINEY STANDS OUT IN A SOLEMN WAY AS THE ONE UNDISPUTED THING IN THE MASTER'S CAREER LITTLE DID MISTER QUINEY THINK WHEN HE WROTE THAT LETTER THAT HE WAS WRITING FOR THE AGES
AND ONE GROWS TO THE BELIEF THAT WHILE WOMAN'S GLORY IS HER HAIR MAN'S GLORY IS TO DEFEAT SOME ONE AND IF HE CAN DEFEAT WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER HIS MONUMENT IS TWICE AS HIGH AS IF HE HAD ONLY VISITED ON HIS BROTHER MAN A PLAIN UNDOING
YET IT WAS A FACT THAT THE BREWER TOO HAD BROUGHT DEFEAT TO VAST NUMBERS AND HAD LIKE SAUL SLAUGHTERED HIS THOUSANDS WHEN I VISITED THE SITE OF THE GLOBE THEATER AND FOUND THEREON A BREWERY
THE FINEST MEMORIAL IN SAINT PAUL'S IS TO A CERTAIN EMINENT IRISHMAN ARTHUR WELLESLEY THE MINES AND QUARRIES OF EARTH HAVE BEEN CALLED ON FOR THEIR RICHEST CONTRIBUTIONS AND TALENT AND SKILL HAVE GIVEN THEIR ALL TO PRODUCE THIS ENDURING WORK OF BEAUTY
SOON AFTER LEAVING THE CHURCH A RUSTIC SWAIN HAILED ME AND ASKED FOR A MATCH THE PIPE AND THE VIRGINIA WEED THEY MEAN AMITY THE WORLD OVER IF I HAD QUESTIONS TO ASK NOW WAS THE TIME SO I ASKED
AND COME TO THINK OF IT RUSTICUS IS RIGHT MOST GREAT MEN HAVE AT SOME TIME DEPARTED HASTILY WITHOUT LEAVING ORDERS WHERE TO FORWARD THEIR MAIL INDEED IT SEEMS NECESSARY THAT A MAN SHOULD HAVE RUN AWAY AT LEAST ONCE
AS AN EXPLOITER THE CORSICAN OVERDID THE THING A BIT SO THE WORLD AROSE AND PUT HIM DOWN BUT SAFELY DEAD HIS SHADE CAN BOAST A GRAVE SO SUMPTUOUS THAT ENGLISHMEN IN PARIS REFUSE TO LOOK UPON IT BUT ENGLAND NEED NOT BE ASHAMED
IN TRUTH I AM TOLD BY A FRIEND WHO HAS A BIAS FOR STATISTICS THAT ALL MONUMENTS ABOVE FIFTY FEET HIGH IN ENGLAND ARE TO THE HONOR OF MEN WHO HAVE DEFEATED OTHER MEN WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE ARE THE ALBERT MEMORIAL
BUT HIS SON IN LAW DOCTOR JOHN HALL HONORED THE GREAT MAN AND WAS BOUND HE SHOULD HAVE A WORTHY RESTING PLACE SO AT MIDNIGHT WITH THE HELP OF A FEW TRUSTED FRIENDS HE DUG THE GRAVE AND LOWERED THE DUST OF ENGLAND'S GREATEST SON
SITTING ON THE FRONT SEAT HOLDING THE BABY AND ALL THE OTHER SEVEN CHILDREN SITTING ON THE STRAW BEHIND AND WE MAY BE SURE THAT THE ELDEST BOY IN THAT BROOD NEVER FORGOT THE DAY
WHAT MONUMENT SUBLIMER THAN LEAR STERNER THAN THE MERCHANT OF VENICE MORE DAZZLING THAN ROMEO AND JULIET
AND WHILE I CAN NOT RESTRAIN A BLUSH FOR OUR ENGLISH COUSINS I AM PROUD THAT OVER HALF THE VISITORS AT THE BIRTHPLACE ARE AMERICANS AND PROUDER STILL AM I TO REMEMBER THAT THEY ALL WRITE LETTERS TO THE NEWSPAPERS AT HOME ABOUT STRATFORD ON AVON
THIS GUEST OF SUMMER THE TEMPLE HAUNTING MARTLET DOES APPROVE BY HIS LOVED MANSIONRY THAT THE HEAVEN'S BREATH SMELLS WOOINGLY HERE NO JUTTY FRIEZE BUTTRESS NOR COIGN OF VANTAGE BUT THIS BIRD HATH MADE HIS PENDENT BED
OR IF HE DID NOT GO HIMSELF HE COMPELLED OTHERS TO DO SO AND WHO BUT A BRUTE WOULD KILL A MAN WITHOUT BENEFIT OF THE CLERGY SO EACH ESTATE HIRED ITS PRIESTS BY THE YEAR JUST AS MEN WITH A TASTE FOR LITIGATION HOLD ATTORNEYS IN CONSTANT RETAINER
AT THE FOOT OF THE MONUMENT IS A LINE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE INSCRIPTION THEREON WAS WRITTEN BY THE ONLY ONE IN POSSESSION OF THE FACTS SIR THOMAS HIMSELF SEVERAL EPITAPHS IN THE CHURCHYARD ARE WORTHY OF SPACE IN YOUR COMMONPLACE BOOK
JASPER SERPENTINE BASALT PORPHYRY GRANITE
SAINT PETER'S OF ROME DOES NOT REACH TO THE ANKLE OF DANTE WHAT ARCHITECT HAS THE SKILL TO BUILD A TOWER SO HIGH AS THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE ADD ANYTHING IF YOU CAN TO MIND THEN WHY A MONUMENT TO SHAKESPEARE
THEN IF THE FARMER LEAVES A SPOT UNTILLED THE DOGROSE PRE EMPTS THE PLACE AND SHOWERS ITS PETALS ON THE VAGRANT WINDS
IN ORDER AFTERWARD TO ATTAIN EMINENCE MOSES LOT TARQUIN PERICLES DEMOSTHENES SAINT PAUL SHAKESPEARE ROUSSEAU VOLTAIRE GOLDSMITH HUGO BUT THE LIST IS TOO LONG TO GIVE
THE VIRTUES ESSENTIAL AND PECULIAR TO THE EXALTED STATION OF BRITISH WORTHY DEBAR THE UNFORTUNATE POSSESSOR FROM ENTERING PARADISE THERE IS NOT A LORD CHANCELLOR OR LORD MAYOR OR LORD OF THE CHAMBER OR MASTER OF THE HOUNDS
ALL MANSIONS CASTLES AND PRISONS IN ENGLAND HAVE CHAPELS OR CHURCHES ATTACHED AND THIS IS WELL FOR IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS IT SEEMED WISE TO KEEP IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH THE OTHER WORLD FOR OFTEN ON SHORT NOTICE
BUT THERE IS NO PARK AND NO MONUMENT AND NO WHITE HAIRED OLD POET TO GIVE YOU WELCOME ONLY A BREWERY AY MON BUT AIN'T UT A BIG UN PROTESTED AN ENGLISHMAN WHO HEARD MY MURMURS YES
AND A MONUMENT TO A WORTHY BREWER WHO DIED AND LEFT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS TO CHARITY I MENTIONED THIS FACT TO MY FRIEND BUT HE UNHORSED ME BY DECLARING THAT MODESTY FORBADE CARVING TRUTH ON MONUMENTS
BUT JUST SUPPOSE THAT SHAKESPEARE HAD NOT RUN AWAY AND TO WHOM DO WE OWE IT THAT HE DID LEAVE JUSTICE SHALLOW OR ANN HATHAWAY OR BOTH I SHOULD SAY TO ANN FIRST AND HIS HONOR SECOND
IN FACT A CABBY JUST OUTSIDE OF NEW PLACE OFFERED TO TAKE ME TO THE WHIRLPOOL AND THE CANADA SIDE FOR A DOLLAR AT LEAST THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT HE SAID OF COURSE IT IS BARELY POSSIBLE THAT I WAS DAYDREAMING
NO MAN CAN TELL THE SAME STORY OVER AND OVER WITHOUT SOON REACHING A POINT WHERE HE BETRAYS HIS WEARINESS AND THEN HE FLAVORS THE WHOLE WITH A DASH OF CONTEMPT BUT A GOOD WOMAN HEAVEN BLESS HER IS EVER EAGER TO PLEASE
AND THE HEIGHTS WHERE THE LIGHTNING PLAYS AND THE MISTS HOVER ARE CERTAINLY GOOD TIMBER FOR POETRY AFTER YOU HAVE CAUGHT YOUR POET BUT NATURE ELUDES ALL FORMULA AGAIN IT IS THE HUMAN INTEREST THAT ADDS VITALITY TO ART
THAT'S THE WAY I EXPRESSED IT TO MY NEW FOUND FRIEND AND HE AGREED WITH ME SO WE SHOOK HANDS AND PARTED CHARLCOTE IS AS FAIR AS A DREAM OF PARADISE
BUT STILL SHOULD NOT ENGLAND HAVE A FITTING MONUMENT TO SHAKESPEARE HE IS HER ONE UNIVERSAL CITIZEN HIS NAME IS HONORED IN EVERY SCHOOL OR COLLEGE OF EARTH WHERE BOOKS ARE PRIZED
AND PROCREANT CRADLE WHERE THEY MOST BREED AND HAUNT I HAVE OBSERVED THE AIR IS DELICATE FIVE MILES FROM WARWICK TEN IF YOU BELIEVE THE CAB DRIVERS ARE THE RUINS OF KENILWORTH CASTLE
WHICH PROVES THAT KINDLINESS IS NOT DEAD THEN THERE ARE BIG HORSES THAT DRAW THE BIG WAGONS AND ON THE CORNER THERE IS A BIG TAPROOM WHERE THE THIRSTY ARE SERVED WITH BIG GLASSES THE FOUNDER OF THIS BREWERY BECAME RICH
AND IF MY STATISTICAL FRIEND IS RIGHT THE OWNERS OF THESE MIGHTY VATS HAVE DEFEATED MANKIND WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER WE HAVE SEEN THAT ALTHOUGH NAPOLEON THE DEFEATED HAS A MORE GORGEOUS TOMB THAN WELLINGTON WHO DEFEATED HIM
WHAT FRAMEWORK OF CEDAR OR OAK WILL LAST AS LONG AS OTHELLO WHAT BRONZE CAN EQUAL THE BRONZE OF HAMLET NO CONSTRUCTION OF LIME OR ROCK OF IRON AND OF CEMENT IS WORTH THE DEEP BREATH OF GENIUS
THERE IS NO SCHOLAR IN ANY CLIME WHO IS NOT HIS DEBTOR HE WAS BORN IN ENGLAND HE NEVER WAS OUT OF ENGLAND HIS ASHES REST IN ENGLAND BUT ENGLAND'S BUDGET HAS NEVER BEEN BALLASTED WITH A SINGLE POUND
AS THE TOURIST APPROACHES THE CITY OF LONDON FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE ARE FOUR MONUMENTS THAT PROBABLY WILL ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION THEY LIFT THEMSELVES OUT OF THE FOG AND SMOKE AND SOOT AND SEEM TO STRUGGLE TOWARD THE BLUE
HE DEFEATED THE AMERICANS WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER AND SO WHEREVER IN ENGLAND I SEE A BEAUTIFUL MONUMENT
AND A MILE FARTHER IS WASPERTON WITH ITS QUAINT OLD STONE CHURCH IT IS A GOOD PLACE TO REST FOR NOTHING IS SO SOOTHING AS A COOL CHURCH WHERE THE DIM LIGHT STREAMS THROUGH COLORED WINDOWS AND OUT OF SIGHT SOMEWHERE AN ORGAN SOFTLY PLAYS
IN ENGLAND POETS ARE RELEGATED TO A CORNER THE EARTH AND THE FULNESS THEREOF BELONGS TO THE MEN WHO CAN KILL ON THIS ROCK HAVE THE ENGLISH STATE AND CHURCH BEEN BUILT
AND WHEN I SAW THAT SIGN AND POINTING FINGER I FELT LIKE LEAVING ALL AND FLYING THENCE JUST BEYOND THE BRIDGE SETTLED SNUGLY IN A FOREST OF WAVING BRANCHES WE SEE STORIED OLD WARWICK CASTLE WITH CAESAR'S TOWER LIFTING ITSELF FROM THE MASS OF GREEN
STRATFORD IS JUST ANOTHER VILLAGE OF NIAGARA FALLS THE SAME SHOPS THE SAME GUIDES THE SAME HACKMEN ALL ARE THERE SAVE POOR LO WITH HIS BEADWORK AND SASSAFRAS
IF THE COAST HAPPENS TO BE CLEAR TO TAP OF DRUM IT COSTS A SHILLING TO VISIT THE CASTLE A FINE OLD SOLDIER IN SPOTLESS UNIFORM WITH WAXED WHITE MOUSTACHE AND DANGLING SWORD CONDUCTS THE VISITORS
I HAVE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BEEN TO THE SHAKESPEARE COUNTRY APPROACHING IT FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS BUT EACH TIME I AM SET DOWN AT LEAMINGTON PERHAPS THIS IS BY SOME ACT OF PARLIAMENT I REALLY DO NOT KNOW
HE SIGNED A BOND WHEN EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AGREEING TO MARRY HER SHE WAS TWENTY SIX NO RECORD IS FOUND OF THE MARRIAGE BUT WE SHOULD THINK OF HER GRATEFULLY FOR NO DOUBT IT WAS SHE WHO STARTED THE LAD OFF FOR LONDON
I ANSWER
HER LAND IS SPIKED WITH GLISTENING MONUMENTS TO GREATNESS GONE AND ON THESE MONUMENTS ONE OFTEN GETS THE EPITOMIZED LIFE OF THE MAN WHOSE DUST LIES BELOW ON THE CARVED MARBLE TO LORD CORNWALLIS I READ THAT
SAVE MORE THAN TO PLAY A TRICK OR TWO ON THE HOUNDS THAT BLINKED IN THE SUN DOWN TOWARD STRATFORD THERE ARE FLAT ISLANDS COVERED WITH SEDGE LONG ROWS OF WEEPING WILLOWS LOW HAZEL HAWTHORN AND PLACES WHERE GREEN GROW THE RUSHES O
I WAS AT STRATFORD FOUR DAYS AND WENT JUST FOUR TIMES TO THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP EACH DAY THE SAME BRIGHT BRITISH DAMSEL CONDUCTED ME THROUGH AND TOLD HER TALE BUT IT WAS ALWAYS WITH ANIMATION AND A CERTAIN SWEET SATISFACTION IN HER MISSION AND STARCHED APRON THAT WAS VERY CHARMING
IT IS A MELANCHOLY OF MINE OWN COMPOUNDED OF MANY SIMPLES EXTRACTED FROM MANY OBJECTS AND INDEED THE SUNDRY CONTEMPLATION OF MY TRAVELS IN WHICH MY OFTEN RUMINATION WRAPS ME IN A MOST HUMOROUS SADNESS
WHOSE SHARES ARE WARRANTED TO MAKE THE OWNER RICH BEYOND THE DREAM OF AVARICE I WAS DEPRESSED IN MY BOYHOOD I HAD SUPPOSED THAT IF EVER I SHOULD REACH THIS SPOT WHERE SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS WERE FIRST PRODUCED
WARWICK IS WORTH OUR WHILE FOR HERE WE SEE SCENES SUCH AS SHAKESPEARE SAW AND OUR DELIGHT IS IN THE THINGS THAT HIS EYES BEHELD AT THE FOOT OF MILL STREET ARE THE RUINS OF THE OLD GOTHIC BRIDGE THAT LEADS OFF TO BANBURY
YET THERE IS CONSOLATION IN THE THOUGHT THAT ALTHOUGH ENGLAND HAS NO MONUMENT TO SHAKESPEARE HE NOW HAS THE FREEDOM OF ELYSIUM WHILE THE PRESENT ADDRESS OF THE BRITISH WORTHIES WHO HAVE BATTENED AND FATTENED ON POOR HUMANITY'S THIRST FOR STRONG DRINK
AND THERE WERE GREAT DOINGS MOST EVERY DAY TO WHICH THE YEOMANRY WERE OFT INVITED JOHN SHAKESPEARE WAS A WORTHY CITIZEN OF WARWICKSHIRE AND IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT HE RECEIVED AN INVITATION AND THAT HE DROVE OVER WITH MARY ARDEN HIS WIFE
AND I AM GLAD TO REMEMBER THAT THE COLUMBUS WHO DISCOVERED STRATFORD AND GAVE IT TO THE PEOPLE WAS AN AMERICAN I AM PROUD TO THINK THAT AMERICANS HAVE WRITTEN SO CHARMINGLY OF SHAKESPEARE I AM PROUD TO KNOW THAT AT STRATFORD NO MAN BESIDES THE MASTER IS AS HONORED AS IRVING
IN THE GREAT HALL ARE TO BE SEEN THE SWORD AND ACCOUTERMENTS OF THE FABLED GUY THE MACE OF THE KINGMAKER THE HELMET OF CROMWELL AND THE ARMOR OF LORD BROOKE KILLED AT LITCHFIELD AND THAT SHAKESPEARE SAW THESE THINGS THERE IS NO DOUBT
HE IMPARTS FULL TWO SHILLINGS WORTH OF FACTS AS WE GO ALL WITH A FIERCE ROLL OF R'S AS BECOMES A MAN OF WAR THE LONG LINE OF BATTLEMENTS THE MASSIVE BUTTRESSES THE ANGULAR ENTRANCE CUT THROUGH SOLID ROCK
OR BEEFEATER IN ORDINARY OR ANY SORT OF BRITISH BIGWIG OUT OF THE WHOLE OF BRITISH BEADLEDOM UPON WHICH THE SUN NEVER SETS IN ELYSIUM THIS IS THE ONLY DIGNITY BEYOND THEIR REACH
OF MAIL COACH MARKET ASSIZE AND KINGLY COURT COLBRAND ARMED WITH GIANT CLUB SIR GUY RICHARD NEVILLE KINGMAKER AND HIS BARBARIC TRAIN ALL TROD THESE STREETS WATERED THEIR HORSES IN THIS RIVER
AND ALL WRITE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PLACE I DARE NOT IN THE FACE OF BAEDEKER DO IT FURTHER THAN THAT IN EVERY LIBRARY THERE ARE WASHINGTON IRVING HAWTHORNE AND WILLIAM WINTER'S THREE LACRIMOSE BUT CHARMING VOLUMES
THAT FAILED TO PERCEIVE THE CRUEL MOCKERY OF SUCH SELFISH PAGEANTRY HAD HIS VIEW BEEN FROM THE INSIDE HE WOULD NOT HAVE MADE HIS KINGS NOBLE NOR HIS PRINCES GENEROUS
PAST THE BRIGHT RED BRICK PILE OF CHARLCOTE MANSION THE RIVER BANK IS LINED WITH RUSHES AND IN ONE PLACE I SAW THE PRONGS OF ANTLERS SHAKING THE ELDERS
THEY ARE ALL A WASTE OF PAINS GENIUS CAN DO WITHOUT THEM WHAT IS AS INDESTRUCTIBLE AS THESE THE TEMPEST THE WINTER'S TALE JULIUS CAESAR CORIOLANUS
THESE NARROW STONY STREETS HAVE RUNG WITH THE CLANG AND ECHO OF HURRYING HOOFS THE TRAMP OF ROYALIST AND PARLIAMENTARIAN HORSE AND FOOT DRUM AND BANNER THE STIR OF PRINCELY VISITS
WARWICK CASTLE IS PROBABLY IN BETTER CONDITION NOW THAN IT WAS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY BUT PRACTICALLY IT IS THE SAME IT IS THE ONLY CASTLE IN ENGLAND WHERE THE PORTCULLIS IS LOWERED AT TEN O'CLOCK EVERY NIGHT AND RAISED IN THE MORNING
THAT TELLS POSTERITY OF THE MIGHTY ACTS OF THIS MIGHTY MAN THE RARE RICHNESS AND LAVISH BEAUTY OF THE WELLINGTON MAUSOLEUM
THEN THEY HASTILY REPLACED THE STONES AND OVER THE GRAVE THEY PLACED THE SLAB THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT GOOD FRIEND FOR JESUS SAKE FORBEAR TO DIG THE DUST ENCLOSED HERE BLEST BE THE MAN WHO SPARES THESE STONES AND CURSED BE HE WHO MOVES MY BONES
ALL ABOUT ARE QUAINT OLD HOUSES AND SHOPS WITH RED TILED ROOFS AND LITTLE WINDOWS WITH DIAMOND PANES HUNG ON HINGES WHERE MAIDENS FAIR HAVE LOOKED DOWN ON BRAVE MEN IN COATS OF MAIL
IN CHARLCOTE CHURCH IS A MEMORIAL TO SIR THOMAS LUCY AND THERE IS A GLOWING EPITAPH THAT QUITE UPSETS ANY OF THOSE TAUNTING AND DEFAMING ALLUSIONS IN THE MERRY WIVES
SINCE SAMUEL JOHNSON WAS EXECUTOR OF THRALE'S ESTATE IS UNKNOWN WE HAVE THIS ON THE AUTHORITY OF A SOLID ENGLISHMAN WHO SAYS
A THREAT FROM A GHOST AH NO ONE DARE MOLEST THAT GRAVE BESIDES THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO WAS BURIED THERE NEITHER ARE WE QUITE SURE LONG YEARS AFTER THE INTERMENT SOME ONE SET A BUST OF THE POET
EACH PUSHING HARD FOR SOLE POSSESSION IT IS EIGHT MILES FROM WARWICK TO STRATFORD BY THE DIRECT ROAD BUT TEN BY THE RIVER I HAVE WALKED BOTH ROUTES AND CONSIDER THE LATTER THE SHORTER TWO MILES DOWN THE RIVER IS BARFORD
CROOKED ABRUPT WITH PLACES WHERE FIGHTING MEN CAN LIE IN AMBUSH ALL IS AS SHAKESPEARE KNEW IT THERE ARE THE CEDARS OF LEBANON BROUGHT BY CRUSADERS FROM THE EAST AND THE SCREAMING PEACOCKS IN THE PAVED COURTWAY AND
THE AGE OF MIRACLES IS PAST OR THAT BIT OF JOLLY CLAPTRAP CONCERNING THE SACRED BABOONS THAT ARE SEEN ABOUT CERTAIN TEMPLES IN INDIA THEY CAN TALK EXPLAIN THE PRIESTS BUT BEING WISE THEY NEVER DO
STRUCK ME AS HAVING THE TRUE RING FAREWELL PROUD VAIN FALSE TREACHEROUS WORLD WE HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF THEE WE VALUE NOT WHAT THOU CANST SAY OF WE
THE WRITER QUOTED IS AN HONORABLE MAN AND I AM SURE HE WOULD NOT MAKE THIS ASSERTION IF HE DID NOT HAVE PROOF OF THE FACT SO FOR THE PRESENT I WILL ALLOW HIM TO GO ON HIS OWN RECOGNIZANCE
AND A TABLET ON THE WALL OVER AGAINST THE GRAVE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IF OCCASION DEMANDS I MIGHT MUSTER A SUBLIME CONCEIT BUT CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT TEN THOUSAND AMERICANS VISIT STRATFORD EVERY YEAR
BUT WE HAVE NO PROOF THAT SHE EVER KNEW THAT ANY SUCH PERSON AS W SHAKESPEARE LIVED HOWEVER SHE CAME TO CHARLCOTE AND DINED ON VENISON AND WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT SHE AND SHAKESPEARE DID NOT MEET IN LONDON AFTERWARD AND TALK IT OVER
JUDITH MARRIED THOMAS QUINEY THE ONLY LETTER ADDRESSED TO SHAKESPEARE THAT CAN BE FOUND IS ONE FROM THE HAPPY FATHER OF THOMAS MISTER RICHARD QUINEY WHEREIN HE ASKS FOR A LOAN OF THIRTY POUNDS
HE IS HIS OWN MONUMENT AND ENGLAND IS ITS PEDESTAL SHAKESPEARE HAS NO NEED OF A PYRAMID HE HAS HIS WORK WHAT CAN BRONZE OR MARBLE DO FOR HIM MALACHITE AND ALABASTER ARE OF NO AVAIL
AND RUSTICUS INFORMED ME THAT HAMPTON LUCY WAS ONLY A MILE BEYOND AND THAT SHAKESPEARE NEVER STOLE DEER AT ALL SO I HOPE WE SHALL HEAR NO MORE OF THAT LIBELOUS ACCUSATION BUT DID SHAKESPEARE RUN AWAY I DEMANDED
I SAW BRIARWOOD PIPES WITH SHAKESPEARE'S FACE CARVED ON THE BOWL ALL FOR ONE AND SIX FEATHER FANS WITH ADVICE TO THE PLAYERS PRINTED ACROSS THE FOLDS THE SEVEN AGES ON HANDKERCHIEFS AND SOUVENIR SPOONS GALORE ALL WARRANTED GORHAM'S BEST
CAMPED ON YONDER BANK OR HUDDLED IN THIS CASTLE YARD AND AGAIN THEY CAME BACK WHEN WILL SHAKESPEARE A YOUTH FROM STRATFORD EIGHT MILES AWAY CAME HERE AND WAVED HIS MAGIC WAND
BUT I THINK THE FACTS ARE THAT IT WAS HE WHO DOZED AND WAKING SUDDENLY AS I PASSED GAVE ME THE WRONG CUE THERE IS A MACBETH LIVERY STABLE A FALSTAFF BAKERY AND ALL THE SHOPS AND STORES KEEP OTHELLO THIS AND HAMLET THAT
THE VISITOR AT THE BIRTHPLACE IS GIVEN A CHEERFUL LITTLE LECTURE ON THE VARIOUS RELICS AND CURIOSITIES AS THEY ARE SHOWN THE YOUNG LADIES WHO PERFORM THIS OFFICE ARE CLEVER WOMEN WITH PLEASANT VOICES AND BIG STARCHED WHITE APRONS
