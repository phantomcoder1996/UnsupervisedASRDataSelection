IN CURZON STREET BUT WITHOUT THE CARPET BAG AND PORTMANTEAU FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN SENT AND WITH A VERY PUZZLED AND ODD FACE THEY WON'T GIVE EM UP
HE HAD A SINGULAR MUSEUM HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST SHOTS IN ENGLAND AND FOR A HEAVY MAN ONE OF THE BEST RIDERS INDEED HE AND CRAWLEY
I SAY MAC IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG IF I DROP I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO TO GO AND SEE HIM YOU KNOW AND SAY THAT I WAS VERY FOND OF HIM AND THAT
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE IT WAS A REGULAR PLAN BETWEEN THAT SCOUNDREL AND HER HE SAID THE BAILIFFS WERE PUT UPON ME I WAS TAKEN AS I WAS GOING OUT OF HIS HOUSE WHEN I WROTE TO HER FOR MONEY
AND THE PUBLICAN SHUTTING HIS SHUTTERS IN THE SUNSHINE AGAINST SERVICE COMMENCED THE PEOPLE JOKED AT THE CAB STAND ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE AS HE TOOK A CARRIAGE THERE
TO WRAP A BALL IN THE NOTE AND KILL STEYNE WITH IT AFTER THIS COLLOQUY THE BROTHERS ONCE MORE SHOOK HANDS AND PARTED
SHE BROUGHT EVERYBODY TO THE HOUSE AND SHE MADE JOS BELIEVE THAT IT WAS HIS OWN GREAT SOCIAL TALENTS AND WIT
AS RAWDON IN HIS EVENING COSTUME WHICH HE HAD NOW WORN TWO DAYS PASSED BY THE SCARED FEMALE WHO WAS SCOURING THE STEPS AND ENTERED INTO HIS BROTHER'S STUDY LADY JANE
A MODEL OF NEATNESS AND EVERY PROPRIETY HE STARTED WHEN HE SAW POOR RAWDON IN HIS STUDY IN TUMBLED CLOTHES WITH BLOOD SHOT EYES AND HIS HAIR OVER HIS FACE
ANY EXPLANATION THE CHILDREN CAME UP TO SALUTE HIM AND HE KISSED THEM IN HIS USUAL FRIGID MANNER THE MOTHER TOOK BOTH OF THEM CLOSE TO HERSELF AND HELD A HAND OF EACH OF THEM
WHEN I'M IN THE ARMY WON'T I HATE THE FRENCH THAT'S ALL
AND EVERY KIND OF PERSON IN A WORD WAS RESTING HIMSELF AFTER THE NIGHT'S LABOURS AND NOT BEING ON DUTY WAS IN BED HIS ROOM WAS HUNG ROUND WITH BOXING SPORTING AND DANCING PICTURES
SHE'S BEEN MAKING A PURSE FOR HERSELF ALL THE TIME AND GRUDGED ME A HUNDRED POUND TO GET ME OUT OF QUOD HE THEN FIERCELY AND INCOHERENTLY AND WITH AN AGITATION
I TOLD HIM HE WAS A LIAR AND A COWARD AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND THRASHED HIM SERVE HIM RIGHT MACMURDO SAID WHO IS IT RAWDON ANSWERED IT WAS LORD STEYNE
RAWDON SAT DOWN IN THE STUDY BEFORE THE BARONET'S TABLE
AND SAY HIS PRAYERS IN THE MOSQUES
THERE HEARD OF HER FASCINATIONS AND WERE QUITE CURIOUS TO KNOW HER WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT SHE WAS NOBLE OF AN ANCIENT ENGLISH FAMILY THAT HER HUSBAND WAS A COLONEL OF THE GUARD
SHE SAID SHE WAS ILL IN BED AND PUT ME OFF TO ANOTHER DAY AND WHEN I GOT HOME I FOUND HER IN DIAMONDS AND SITTING WITH THAT VILLAIN ALONE
BREAKFAST WAS SO LATE THAT DAY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DELAYS WHICH HAD OCCURRED THAT THE CHURCH BELLS BEGAN TO RING WHILST THEY WERE SITTING OVER THEIR MEAL AND LADY JANE WAS TOO ILL SHE SAID
BROUGHT OUT THE PURPLE SILENUS IN A RED AND SILVER WAISTCOAT WHO ACTS AS PORTER OF THAT PALACE THE MAN WAS SCARED ALSO BY THE COLONEL'S DISHEVELLED APPEARANCE
AND AS SHE LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT OF NIGHTS IT NO LONGER REPROACHED HER PERHAPS SHE REPROACHED IT NOW WILLIAM WAS GONE EMMY WAS NOT VERY HAPPY AFTER HER HEROIC SACRIFICE
IN A WAY WHICH EVEN MADE THE BOY SMILE SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE THOUGHT MAJOR WILLIAM WAS THE BEST MAN IN ALL THE WORLD THE GENTLEST AND THE KINDEST THE BRAVEST AND THE HUMBLEST
AND AFTER HIS CONFERENCE WITH HIS BROTHER HE WAS GOING AWAY TO MAKE THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MEETING WHICH MUST ENSUE
HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE HURRIEDLY THE PERSONAL CONFLICT WITH LORD STEYNE TO AN AFFAIR OF THAT NATURE OF COURSE HE SAID THERE WAS BUT ONE ISSUE
AND TO SUCH AN ANGEL AS HIM WHOM SHE HAD HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO MARRY WAS MARRIED FOREVER BUT SHE HAD NO OBJECTION TO HEAR THE MAJOR PRAISED
A VETERAN OFFICER AND WATERLOO MAN GREATLY LIKED BY HIS REGIMENT IN WHICH WANT OF MONEY ALONE PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTAINING THE HIGHEST RANKS WAS ENJOYING THE FORENOON CALMLY IN BED
AND THERE'S ONLY A WAY OUT OF IT FOR ONE OF US MAC DO YOU UNDERSTAND I WAS PUT OUT OF THE WAY ARRESTED I FOUND EM ALONE TOGETHER
FOR HIS ACQUAINTANCES WITH THE GREATEST PRUDENCE AND SKILL HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE LATE LAMENTED COMMANDER IN CHIEF HAD HAD THE GREATEST REGARD FOR MACMURDO ON THIS ACCOUNT
AND THE DARK LOOKS OF HER HUSBAND THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE QUESTION OF BREAKFAST BETWEEN THEM RAWDON MUTTERED SOME EXCUSES ABOUT AN ENGAGEMENT SQUEEZING HARD THE TIMID LITTLE HAND
INVITED BY THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE TO MEET HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
HE THOUGHT HIS BROTHER WAS NOT SOBER
THE MAN AS WAS VERY NOISY AND DRUNK INDEED SAYS NOTHING SHALL GO OUT OF THE HOUSE UNTIL HIS WAGES IS PAID UP THE ACCOUNT OF THIS LITTLE REVOLUTION IN MAY FAIR ASTONISHED
THAT ONE PLACED FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE STEWARD AGENT OR CONFIDENTIAL VISITOR WHO CAME TO TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH THE BARONET AND TRIMMED HIS NAILS MORE VEHEMENTLY THAN EVER PITT
IT WAS DAMNED UNFRIENDLY MAC SAID RAWDON QUITE OVERCOME AND COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS HE GAVE WAY TO AN EMOTION THE SIGHT OF WHICH CAUSED THE TOUGH OLD CAMPAIGNER
ON THE STUDY TABLE AND AWAITING HIS JUDICIOUS SELECTION AND BY THE SERMON BOOK WAS THE OBSERVER NEWSPAPER DAMP AND NEATLY FOLDED AND FOR SIR PITT'S OWN PRIVATE USE
THINK OF HIS ONLY FINDING HER OUT NOW THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AND REMEMBERED A HUNDRED PARTICULAR CONVERSATIONS AT THE MESS TABLE IN WHICH MISSUS CRAWLEY'S REPUTATION
EVEN THE HUNDRED POUNDS THAT JANE TOOK YOU LAST NIGHT WERE PROMISED TO MY LAWYER TO MORROW MORNING AND THE WANT OF IT WILL PUT ME TO GREAT INCONVENIENCE
THE LITTLE WOMAN THOUGHT THAT THE SECRET MIGHT KEEP AND INDEED BEING BY NO MEANS SO MUCH INTERESTED
THAN THEY HAD BEEN TO BESTOW THE SAME INESTIMABLE BENEFITS UPON AMELIA LOVE AND LIBERTY ARE INTERPRETED BY THOSE SIMPLE GERMANS IN A WAY WHICH HONEST FOLKS
AND HER NIECE AS THEY WERE TAKING EARLY TEA AND HOT BUTTERED TOAST IN THE FORMER LADY'S APARTMENT AND WONDERED HOW THE RAWDING CRAWLEYS COULD GIT ON THE VALET HAD DAMPED AND FOLDED THE PAPER ONCE MORE
HE HAD READ IN THE JOURNAL A FLAMING ACCOUNT OF FESTIVITIES AT GAUNT HOUSE
SO THAT IT LOOKED QUITE FRESH AND INNOCENT AGAINST THE ARRIVAL OF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE POOR RAWDON TOOK UP THE PAPER AND BEGAN TO TRY AND READ IT UNTIL HIS BROTHER SHOULD ARRIVE
BARRACKS ALL THE BELLS WERE JANGLING AND TOLLING AS HE REACHED THAT PLACE
RUMMAGING HIS MOTHER'S DESK SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FOUND THE GLOVES NEATLY FOLDED UP
RAWDON SAID WITH A BROKEN VOICE AND AS THE BOY HAS NO MOTHER I MUST LEAVE HIM TO YOU AND JANE PITT ONLY IT WILL BE A COMFORT TO ME IF YOU WILL PROMISE ME TO BE HIS FRIEND
BUT ABOUT GOING HOME NEXT SATURDAY WHEN HIS FATHER WOULD CERTAINLY TIP HIM AND PERHAPS WOULD TAKE HIM TO THE PLAY HE'S A REGULAR TRUMP THAT BOY THE FATHER WENT ON STILL MUSING ABOUT HIS SON
HE WAXED HIS MUSTACHIOS INTO A STATE OF BRILLIANT POLISH AND PUT ON A TIGHT CRAVAT AND A TRIM BUFF WAISTCOAT SO THAT ALL THE YOUNG OFFICERS IN THE MESS ROOM WHITHER CRAWLEY HAD PRECEDED HIS FRIEND
THANK YOU BROTHER SAID HE I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOUR WORD I WILL UPON MY HONOUR THE BARONET SAID AND THUS AND ALMOST MUTELY
WAS ONE OF THEM THAT TENDER LOVE SONG OF WEBER'S WHICH IN OLD FASHIONED DAYS YOUNG LADIES AND WHEN YOU WERE SCARCELY BORN SHOWED THAT THOSE WHO LIVED BEFORE YOU KNEW
AND THE BARKING BUTCHER WHICH HAS BEEN BEFORE MENTIONED A VENERABLE BRISTLY WARRIOR WITH A LITTLE CLOSE SHAVED GREY HEAD WITH A SILK NIGHTCAP A RED FACE AND NOSE AND A GREAT
I WISH I WAS RAWDON REPLIED IF IT WASN'T FOR LITTLE RAWDON I'D HAVE CUT MY THROAT THIS MORNING AND THAT DAMNED VILLAIN'S TOO
LET'S SAY AND CLAY LAY OUT SOME DRESSING THINGS FOR THE COLONEL WE WERE ALWAYS PRETTY MUCH OF A SIZE RAWDON MY BOY AND NEITHER OF US RIDE SO LIGHT AS WE DID WHEN WE FIRST ENTERED THE CORPS
PUNCTUALLY AS THE SHRILL TONED BELL OF THE BLACK MARBLE STUDY CLOCK BEGAN TO CHIME NINE SIR PITT MADE HIS APPEARANCE FRESH NEAT SMUGLY SHAVED
I ALWAYS SAID SHE'D THROW YOU OVER HE BEGAN INDEED THERE WERE BETS IN THE REGIMENT AND AT THE CLUBS REGARDING THE PROBABLE FATE OF COLONEL CRAWLEY
SHE FOUND HERSELF SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY IN SNUG COMFORTABLE QUARTERS SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS KINDNESS AND GOOD NATURED SIMPLE PEOPLE
AND WAS WAITING FOR HER HUSBAND IN THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM WITH FEMALE INSTINCT AUGURING EVIL THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM HAPPENED TO BE LEFT OPEN AND THE LADY OF COURSE WAS ISSUING FROM IT
PITT STOOPED AND PICKED THEM UP AMAZED AT SO MUCH WEALTH NOT THAT RAWDON SAID I HOPE TO PUT A BULLET INTO THE MAN WHOM THAT BELONGS TO
BUT HIS HANDS SHOOK AND HE WAS SO AGITATED THAT THE POCKET BOOK FELL FROM HIM AND OUT OF IT THE THOUSAND POUND NOTE WHICH HAD BEEN THE LAST OF THE UNLUCKY BECKY'S WINNINGS
DURING WHICH REBECCA WAS LEFT TO THE SOCIETY OF MISTER JOSEPH
HAD BEEN TORN TO SHREDS THERE'S NO WAY BUT ONE OUT OF IT
OF AMELIA HE DROVE OUT WITH BECKY IN HIS OPEN CARRIAGE HE ASKED LITTLE PARTIES AND INVENTED FESTIVITIES TO DO HER HONOUR TAPEWORM
HAD HE BEEN LOOKING OUT TROOPS OF SCHOOLS WERE ON THEIR MARCH TO CHURCH
OTHERWISE HE WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF SUNDAY PAPERS INTO HIS HOUSEHOLD THE THEATRICAL CRITICISMS THE FIGHT FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS A SIDE BETWEEN THE BARKING BUTCHER
CAPTAIN MACMURDO HAD THE HONOUR OF WAITING UPON THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE ON THE PART OF COLONEL RAWDON CRAWLEY AND BEGGED TO INTIMATE THAT HE WAS EMPOWERED BY THE COLONEL
WENT THROUGH THE COURT LAST WEEK AND WAS WHAT THEY CALL WHITEWASHED I BELIEVE LORD RAGLAND WOULD NOT PAY A SHILLING FOR HIM AND IT'S NOT MONEY I WANT RAWDON BROKE IN I'M NOT COME TO YOU ABOUT MYSELF
SHE WAS RECONCILED TO MISSUS CRAWLEY SUBSEQUENTLY BECAUSE THE LATTER BECAME WILLIAM'S MOST ARDENT ADMIRER AND CHAMPION AND IN THOSE NIGHTLY CONCLAVES IN WHICH THE TWO LADIES INDULGED AFTER THEIR PARTIES
BUT FOR THIS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUITE A DIFFERENT MAN I DIDN'T DO MY DUTY WITH THE REGIMENT SO BAD YOU KNOW HOW I WAS THROWN OVER ABOUT THE MONEY AND WHO GOT IT
THE DEUCE A MARQUIS THEY SAID HE THAT IS THEY SAID YOU WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN ROARED OUT RAWDON DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU EVER HEARD A FELLOW DOUBT ABOUT MY WIFE
SHE TALKED TO HER PERPETUALLY ABOUT MAJOR DOBBIN SENT ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND MADE NO SCRUPLE OF DECLARING HER ADMIRATION FOR THAT EXCELLENT HIGH MINDED GENTLEMAN
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED PITT I'M NOT DRUNK SHUT THE DOOR I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU PITT CLOSED THE DOOR AND CAME UP TO THE TABLE WHERE HE SAT DOWN IN THE OTHER ARM CHAIR
DYED MOUSTACHE WHEN RAWDON TOLD THE CAPTAIN HE WANTED A FRIEND THE LATTER KNEW PERFECTLY WELL ON WHAT DUTY OF FRIENDSHIP HE WAS CALLED TO ACT AND INDEED HAD CONDUCTED SCORES OF AFFAIRS
THE ELDER BROTHER WAS MUCH AFFECTED AND SHOOK RAWDON'S HAND WITH A CORDIALITY SELDOM EXHIBITED BY HIM RAWDON PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS SHAGGY EYEBROWS
TOO HOW TO LOVE AND TO SING CERTAIN SONGS I SAY TO WHICH THE MAJOR WAS PARTIAL
WATCHED OVER THEM WHEN NOBODY CARED FOR THEM HOW ALL HIS COMRADES ADMIRED HIM THOUGH HE NEVER SPOKE OF HIS OWN GALLANT ACTIONS HOW GEORGY'S FATHER TRUSTED HIM BEYOND ALL OTHER MEN
I GAVE UP EVERYTHING I HAD TO HER I'M A BEGGAR BECAUSE I WOULD MARRY HER BY JOVE SIR I'VE PAWNED MY OWN WATCH IN ORDER TO GET HER ANYTHING SHE FANCIED AND SHE
AS THE TWO BROTHERS PASSED OUT OF THE STUDY SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO RAWDON AND SAID SHE WAS GLAD HE WAS COME TO BREAKFAST THOUGH SHE COULD PERCEIVE BY HIS HAGGARD UNSHORN FACE
SPEEDILY MADE HIS WAY UP TO THE ROOM OF HIS OLD FRIEND AND COMRADE CAPTAIN MACMURDO WHO CRAWLEY FOUND TO HIS SATISFACTION WAS IN BARRACKS CAPTAIN MACMURDO
SHE MAY BE INNOCENT AFTER ALL HE SAID SHE SAYS SO
AND A NUMBER OF LADIES OF THE CORPS DE BALLET AND OLD MAC WHO WAS AT HOME WITH PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND RANKS AND CONSORTED WITH GENERALS DOG FANCIERS OPERA DANCERS BRUISERS
AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP NEVER CEASED FROM THAT DAY UNTIL THE LAST WHEN YOUR DEAR FATHER FELL DID DOBBIN KILL THE MAN WHO KILLED PAPA
WHICH CONTAINS BIRTHS MARRIAGES AND DEATHS WHATEVER BECKY'S PRIVATE PLAN MIGHT BE BY WHICH DOBBIN'S TRUE LOVE WAS TO BE CROWNED WITH SUCCESS
RAWDON DISPATCHED CAPTAIN MACMURDO'S SERVANT TO CURZON STREET WITH AN ORDER TO THE DOMESTIC THERE TO GIVE UP A BAG OF CLOTHES OF WHICH THE COLONEL HAD GREAT NEED AND DURING THE MAN'S ABSENCE
TO GET ON WITH AS HE SPOKE
SAID THE MAN THERE'S A REGULAR SHINTY IN THE HOUSE AND EVERYTHING AT SIXES AND SEVENS THE LANDLORD'S COME IN AND TOOK POSSESSION THE SERVANTS WAS A DRINKIN UP IN THE DRAWINGROOM THEY SAID
AND SAY THAT COLONEL CRAWLEY WOULD BE ALL DAY AFTER ONE O'CLOCK AT THE REGENT CLUB IN SAINT JAMES'S STREET NOT AT HOME THE FAT RED FACED MAN LOOKED AFTER HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT
AS HE STRODE AWAY SO DID THE PEOPLE IN THEIR SUNDAY CLOTHES WHO WERE OUT SO EARLY THE CHARITY BOYS WITH SHINING FACES THE GREENGROCER LOLLING AT HIS DOOR
HIS SCANTY HAIR COMBED AND OILED TRIMMING HIS NAILS AS HE DESCENDED THE STAIRS MAJESTICALLY IN A STARCHED CRAVAT AND A GREY FLANNEL DRESSING GOWN A REAL OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN IN A WORD
TO MAKE ANY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MEETING WHICH HE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS HIS LORDSHIP'S INTENTION TO DEMAND AND WHICH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MORNING HAD RENDERED INEVITABLE
MISTER MACMURDO HAD ALSO OCCASION TO TAKE OFF HIS SILK NIGHT CAP AND RUB IT ACROSS HIS EYES GO DOWN AND ORDER SOME BREAKFAST HE SAID TO HIS MAN IN A LOUD CHEERFUL VOICE WHAT'LL YOU HAVE CRAWLEY
UNDER WHICH HIS COUNSELLOR HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN HIM LABOUR TOLD MACMURDO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE STORY HIS ADVISER CAUGHT AT SOME STRAY HINTS IN IT
AS THEY KNELT DOWN TO PRAYERS WHICH SIR PITT READ TO THEM AND TO THE SERVANTS IN THEIR SUNDAY SUITS OR LIVERIES RANGED UPON CHAIRS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HISSING TEA URN
SHE HAD A GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS PERTAINING TO HERSELF TO CONSIDER AND WHICH CONCERNED HER A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN MAJOR DOBBIN'S HAPPINESS IN THIS LIFE
IN HER MORNING GOWN WAS UP AND ABOVE STAIRS IN THE NURSERY SUPERINTENDING THE TOILETTES OF HER CHILDREN AND LISTENING TO THE MORNING PRAYERS WHICH THE LITTLE CREATURES PERFORMED AT HER KNEE
AS FOR EMMY WHO FOUND HERSELF NOT IN THE LEAST MISTRESS OF HER OWN HOUSE EXCEPT WHEN THE BILLS WERE TO BE PAID BECKY SOON DISCOVERED THE WAY TO SOOTHE AND PLEASE HER
WITH WHICH AND LEAVING THE COLONEL TO DRESS HIMSELF MACMURDO TURNED ROUND TOWARDS THE WALL AND RESUMED THE PERUSAL OF BELL'S LIFE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HIS FRIEND'S TOILETTE WAS COMPLETE
AND INDEED BROUGHT THE CONVERSATION ROUND TO THE DOBBIN SUBJECT A SCORE OF TIMES EVERY DAY MEANS WERE EASILY FOUND TO WIN THE FAVOUR OF GEORGY AND THE SERVANTS AMELIA'S MAID
IN THE MOST POLITE MANNER TO APPOINT A FRIEND WITH WHOM HE CAPTAIN M M MIGHT COMMUNICATE AND DESIRED THAT THE MEETING MIGHT TAKE PLACE WITH AS LITTLE DELAY AS POSSIBLE
SHE WOULD BREAK OFF IN THE MIDST OF THE SONG
AND THE LADIES WERE EVEN MORE READY TO CALL HER DU
AND WHILE MISS PAYNE WAS BRUSHING THEIR AIRS
TO GO TO CHURCH THOUGH HER THOUGHTS HAD BEEN ENTIRELY ASTRAY DURING THE PERIOD OF FAMILY DEVOTION RAWDON CRAWLEY MEANWHILE HURRIED ON FROM GREAT GAUNT STREET AND KNOCKING AT THE GREAT
CAPTAIN MARKER IT'S ABOUT ABOUT MY WIFE CRAWLEY ANSWERED CASTING DOWN HIS EYES AND TURNING VERY RED THE OTHER GAVE A WHISTLE
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL TAKE CHARGE OF HIM WHEN I'M GONE THAT DEAR GOOD WIFE OF YOURS HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO HIM AND HE'S FONDER OF HER THAN HE IS OF HIS DAMN IT LOOK HERE PITT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN SHE TOLD HIM HOW THEY OWED EVERYTHING WHICH THEY POSSESSED IN THE WORLD TO THAT KIND FRIEND'S BENEVOLENT CARE OF THEM HOW HE HAD BEFRIENDED THEM ALL THROUGH THEIR POVERTY AND MISFORTUNES
THE MAN ADDED AFTER A PAUSE ONE OF THE SERVANTS IS OFF ALREADY
I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT I WON'T ASSIST YOU ULTIMATELY BUT AS FOR PAYING YOUR CREDITORS IN FULL I MIGHT AS WELL HOPE TO PAY THE NATIONAL DEBT
THIS IS WHAT HE GAVE HER MAC AND SHE KEP IT UNKNOWN TO ME AND WITH THIS MONEY IN THE HOUSE SHE REFUSED TO STAND BY ME WHEN I WAS LOCKED UP
EVERY MORNING SHE AND THEY PERFORMED THIS DUTY PRIVATELY AND BEFORE THE PUBLIC CEREMONIAL AT WHICH SIR PITT PRESIDED AND AT WHICH ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSEHOLD WERE EXPECTED TO ASSEMBLE
SHE PICKETED HER STEED HUNG UP HER WEAPONS AND WARMED HERSELF COMFORTABLY BY HIS FIRE THE HALT IN THAT ROVING RESTLESS LIFE WAS INEXPRESSIBLY SOOTHING AND PLEASANT TO HER
AND HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY BEFRIENDED BY THE GOOD WILLIAM WHY WHEN YOUR PAPA WAS A LITTLE BOY SHE SAID HE OFTEN TOLD ME THAT IT WAS WILLIAM WHO DEFENDED HIM AGAINST A TYRANT AT THE SCHOOL WHERE THEY WERE
SHE WAS VERY DISTRAITE NERVOUS SILENT AND ILL TO PLEASE THE FAMILY HAD NEVER KNOWN HER SO PEEVISH SHE GREW PALE AND ILL
AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT ASHAMED OF HAVING TAKEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN'S MONEY AND HERE'S SOME MORE I'VE ONLY KEPT BACK A FEW POUNDS WHICH BECKY MAY AS WELL HAVE
NEVER MIND WHAT HAPPENS TO ME WHAT IS THE MATTER THEN SAID PITT SOMEWHAT RELIEVED IT'S THE BOY SAID RAWDON IN A HUSKY VOICE
SIR PITT INSTANTLY GUESSED THE TRUTH AND SURMISED THAT LORD STEYNE WAS THE PERSON WHOSE LIFE RAWDON WISHED TO TAKE THE COLONEL TOLD HIS SENIOR BRIEFLY AND IN BROKEN ACCENTS
AND THE LETTERS THE NEATLY DOCKETED BILLS AND SYMMETRICAL PAMPHLETS THE LOCKED ACCOUNT BOOKS DESKS AND DISPATCH BOXES THE BIBLE THE QUARTERLY REVIEW AND THE COURT GUIDE
IT HAS BEEN SAID WAS HEART AND SOUL IN FAVOUR OF THE GENEROUS MAJOR HAVING AT FIRST DISLIKED BECKY FOR BEING THE MEANS OF DISMISSING HIM FROM THE PRESENCE OF HER MISTRESS
WERE THRONGED WITH PEOPLE OUT UPON THEIR SUNDAY PLEASURE BUT THE COLONEL WAS MUCH TOO BUSY TO TAKE ANY HEED OF THESE PHENOMENA AND ARRIVING AT KNIGHTSBRIDGE
CAME TO DINE WITH JOS AND THEN CAME EVERY DAY TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO BECKY POOR EMMY WHO WAS NEVER VERY TALKATIVE AND MORE GLUM AND SILENT THAN EVER AFTER DOBBIN'S DEPARTURE WAS QUITE FORGOTTEN
BUT WHEN HE WAS WITHIN HE STOPPED IN WONDER TO LISTEN TO THAT MAGIC SONG AND THERE HE SAW THE SINGER LYING UPON BEAR SKINS AND FRAGRANT BOUGHS CHEIRON THE ANCIENT CENTAUR THE WISEST OF ALL THINGS BENEATH THE SKY
AND I THINK THERE IS NOTHING MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN SUCH IMBECILE GENTILITY
SHE WOULD MAKE US SO LIVELY AT LOWICK VERY FINE YOU TALK AS IF YOUNG WOMEN WERE TIED UP TO BE CHOSEN LIKE POULTRY AT MARKET AS IF I HAD ONLY TO ASK AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE ME SAID THE VICAR NOT CARING TO SPECIFY WE DON'T WANT EVERYBODY
YOU ARE UNMERCIFUL TO YOUNG GENTLEMEN MISS GARTH SAID THE VICAR WITHIN TWO YARDS OF HER MARY STARTED UP AND BLUSHED IT ALWAYS ANSWERS TO REASON WITH FLY SHE SAID LAUGHINGLY
AND CALLED SADLY BY THEIR BEDS COME AND SET MY SPIRIT FREE THAT I MAY GO HOME TO MY FATHERS AND TO MY KINSFOLK AND THE PLEASANT MINUAN LAND AND THEY ASKED HOW SHALL WE SET YOUR SPIRIT FREE
AND THE ORACLE TOLD HIM THAT HE MUST WANDER FOR HIS SIN TILL THE WILD BEASTS SHOULD FEAST HIM AS THEIR GUEST SO HE WENT ON IN HUNGER AND SORROW FOR MANY A WEARY DAY TILL HE SAW A PACK OF WOLVES THE WOLVES WERE TEARING A SHEEP
AS SHE HAD ONCE FELT WHEN SHE SAW HER FATHER'S HANDS TREMBLING IN A MOMENT OF TROUBLE NO MY DEAR NO I MUST GET BACK
MIXED UP NO DOUBT WITH DREAMS AND FABLES AND YET TRUE AND RIGHT AT HEART SO WE WILL HONOUR THESE OLD ARGONAUTS AND LISTEN TO THEIR STORY AS IT STANDS AND WE WILL TRY TO BE LIKE THEM EACH OF US IN OUR PLACE
I SHALL HAVE TWO PARISHES SAID THE VICAR PREFERRING NOT TO DISCUSS THE VIRTUES OF THAT GAME HE HAD ALREADY SAID TO DOROTHEA I DON'T FEEL BOUND TO GIVE UP SAINT BOTOLPH'S IT IS PROTEST ENOUGH AGAINST THE PLURALISM THEY WANT TO REFORM IF I GIVE SOMEBODY ELSE MOST OF THE MONEY
SHE RESPECTS YOU MORE THAN ANY ONE AND SHE WOULD NOT PUT YOU OFF WITH FUN AS SHE DOES ME OF COURSE I COULD NOT HAVE TOLD ANY ONE ELSE OR ASKED ANY ONE ELSE TO SPEAK TO HER BUT YOU THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO COULD BE SUCH A FRIEND TO BOTH OF US
DOWN TO THE WAIST HE WAS A MAN BUT BELOW HE WAS A NOBLE HORSE HIS WHITE HAIR ROLLED DOWN OVER HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND HIS WHITE BEARD OVER HIS BROAD BROWN CHEST AND HIS EYES WERE WISE AND MILD AND HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MOUNTAIN WALL
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU ABOUT MYSELF THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TOO LAX AND HAVE BEEN UNEASY IN CONSEQUENCE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER HINDRANCE SAID FRED COLORING I DID NOT TELL YOU BEFORE THOUGH PERHAPS I MAY HAVE SAID THINGS THAT MADE YOU GUESS IT
THEN THE RAM FLEW ON WITH PHRIXUS TO THE NORTH EAST ACROSS THE SEA WHICH WE CALL THE BLACK SEA NOW BUT THE HELLENS CALL IT EUXINE AND AT LAST THEY SAY HE STOPPED AT COLCHIS ON THE STEEP CIRCASSIAN COAST AND THERE PHRIXUS MARRIED CHALCIOPE
BUT WHEN THE STATE OF A WOMAN'S AFFECTIONS TOUCHES THE HAPPINESS OF ANOTHER LIFE OF MORE LIVES THAN ONE I THINK IT WOULD BE THE NOBLER COURSE FOR HER TO BE PERFECTLY DIRECT AND OPEN MARY IN HER TURN WAS SILENT
AND AFTER AWHILE PHRIXUS DIED AND WAS BURIED BUT HIS SPIRIT HAD NO REST FOR HE WAS BURIED FAR FROM HIS NATIVE LAND AND THE PLEASANT HILLS OF HELLAS
WILL BE ASKING HER TO TELL ME WHETHER SHE RETURNS IT THAT IS WHAT I WANT HER TO TELL YOU SAID FRED BLUNTLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO UNLESS I CAN GET AT HER FEELING YOU MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BE GUIDED BY THAT AS TO YOUR GOING INTO THE CHURCH
HE SAID TRYING HARD TO THINK OF THE QUESTION SIMPLY FOR FRED'S SAKE NO I SUPPOSE THE ARTICLES ARE RIGHT I AM NOT PREPARED WITH ANY ARGUMENTS TO DISPROVE THEM AND MUCH BETTER CLEVERER FELLOWS THAN I AM GO IN FOR THEM ENTIRELY
AND LAID HIS HAND UPON HIS GOLDEN LOCKS AND SAID ARE YOU AFRAID OF MY HORSE'S HOOFS FAIR BOY OR WILL YOU BE MY PUPIL FROM THIS DAY I WOULD GLADLY HAVE HORSE'S HOOFS LIKE YOU IF I COULD SING SUCH SONGS AS YOURS AND CHEIRON LAUGHED AND SAID
BUT I REPEAT THAT THERE IS A CONDITION WITHOUT WHICH ALL THIS GOOD CANNOT COME TO PASS HE HAS OPENED HIS HEART TO ME MISS GARTH AND ASKED ME TO PLEAD FOR HIM THE CONDITION LIES ENTIRELY IN YOUR FEELING
SHE NEVER WILL SAY SO AND A GOOD WHILE AGO SHE MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO SPEAK TO HER ABOUT IT AGAIN AND SHE HAS SET HER MIND ESPECIALLY AGAINST MY BEING A CLERGYMAN I KNOW THAT BUT I CAN'T GIVE HER UP
AND AS BE PLAYED THEY DANCED TO HIS MEASURE IN AND OUT AND ROUND AND ROUND THERE THEY DANCED HAND IN HAND TILL THE NIGHT FELL OVER LAND AND SEA WHILE THE BLACK GLEN SHONE WITH THEIR BROAD WHITE LIMBS AND THE GLEAM OF THEIR GOLDEN HAIR
AND FORGOT IOLCOS AND HIS FATHER AND ALL HIS FORMER LIFE BUT HE GREW STRONG AND BRAVE AND CUNNING UPON THE PLEASANT DOWNS OF PELION IN THE KEEN HUNGRY MOUNTAIN AIR AND HE LEARNT TO WRESTLE AND TO BOX AND TO HUNT AND TO PLAY UPON THE HARP
NOT A SILLY ONE I HOPE SAID MARY BEGINNING TO PLUCK THE ROSES AGAIN AND FEELING HER HEART BEAT UNCOMFORTABLY NO THOUGH PERHAPS WISDOM IS NOT HIS STRONG POINT BUT RATHER AFFECTION AND SINCERITY
MISTER FAREBROTHER PAUSED A MOMENT AND LOOKED AT MARY HE MEANT TO GIVE FRED HIS FULL ADVANTAGE BUT IT WOULD BE WELL HE THOUGHT TO CLEAR HER MIND OF ANY SUPERSTITIONS SUCH AS WOMEN SOMETIMES FOLLOW WHEN THEY DO A MAN THE WRONG OF MARRYING HIM AS AN ACT OF ATONEMENT
AND TOOK HIM HOME AND CALLED HIM PELIAS BECAUSE HIS FACE WAS BRUISED AND BLACK AND HE GREW UP FIERCE AND LAWLESS AND DID MANY A FEARFUL DEED AND AT LAST HE DROVE OUT A ESON HIS STEP BROTHER AND THEN HIS OWN BROTHER NELEUS
MISS GARTH I SUPPOSE SAID THE VICAR EXAMINING SOME LABELS VERY CLOSELY YES I SHOULDN'T MIND ANYTHING IF SHE WOULD HAVE ME AND I KNOW I COULD BE A GOOD FELLOW THEN AND YOU THINK SHE RETURNS THE FEELING
SAID MISS WINIFRED BUT YOU WOULD LIKE MISS GARTH MOTHER SHOULDN'T YOU MY SON'S CHOICE SHALL BE MINE SAID MISSUS FAREBROTHER WITH MAJESTIC DISCRETION AND A WIFE WOULD BE MOST WELCOME CAMDEN
EITHER HE MAY COUNT ON YOUR REMAINING SINGLE UNTIL HE SHALL HAVE EARNED YOUR HAND OR HE MAY IN ANY CASE BE DISAPPOINTED PARDON ME MARY
IT MUST BE FRED VINCY HE HAS ASKED ME TO CONSULT YOU ABOUT HIS GOING INTO THE CHURCH I HOPE YOU WILL NOT THINK THAT I CONSENTED TO TAKE A LIBERTY IN PROMISING TO DO SO ON THE CONTRARY MISTER FAREBROTHER
SHE HAD ONLY TIME TO FEEL THAT ALL THIS WAS HAZY AND PERHAPS ILLUSORY BUT ONE THING WAS CLEAR AND DETERMINED HER ANSWER SINCE YOU THINK IT MY DUTY MISTER FAREBROTHER I WILL TELL YOU THAT I HAVE TOO STRONG A FEELING FOR FRED TO GIVE HIM UP FOR ANY ONE ELSE
MY GRATITUDE TO HIM FOR ALWAYS LOVING ME BEST AND
BUT NOW I HAVE A TALE OF HEROES WHO SAILED AWAY INTO A DISTANT LAND TO WIN THEMSELVES RENOWN FOR EVER IN THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WHITHER THEY SAILED MY CHILDREN I CANNOT CLEARLY TELL IT ALL HAPPENED LONG AGO
AND YOUNG MEN TOO WHOM YOU KNOW CHILDREN AND SOME OF THEM OF YOUR OWN KIN DID THEY SAY TO THEMSELVES HOW MUCH MONEY SHALL I EARN WHEN THEY WENT OUT TO THE WAR LEAVING WEALTH AND COMFORT AND A PLEASANT HOME AND ALL THAT MONEY CAN GIVE TO FACE HUNGER AND THIRST AND WOUNDS AND DEATH
FOR GOING INTO THE CHURCH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR CONSCIENCE FRED
BUT DUTY HAS A TRICK OF BEHAVING UNEXPECTEDLY SOMETHING LIKE A HEAVY FRIEND WHOM WE HAVE AMIABLY ASKED TO VISIT US AND WHO BREAKS HIS LEG WITHIN OUR GATES HARDLY A WEEK LATER DUTY PRESENTED ITSELF IN HIS STUDY UNDER THE DISGUISE OF FRED VINCY
AND I WISHED TO TRY WHETHER HE WAS FEARLESS AND DARE VENTURE LIKE A HERO'S SON
BUT WHEN THEY SAW ATHAMAS THEY FLED AND LEFT THE SHEEP FOR HIM AND HE ATE OF IT AND THEN HE KNEW THAT THE ORACLE WAS FULFILLED AT LAST SO HE WANDERED NO MORE BUT SETTLED AND BUILT A TOWN AND BECAME A KING AGAIN
AND OTHERS SKINNED THE DEER AND QUARTERED THEM AND SET THEM TO ROAST BEFORE THE FIRE AND WHILE THE VENISON WAS COOKING THEY BATHED IN THE SNOW TORRENT AND WASHED AWAY THE DUST AND SWEAT AND THEN ALL ATE TILL THEY COULD EAT NO MORE FOR THEY HAD TASTED NOTHING SINCE THE DAWN
SO THE POOR CHILDREN WERE BROUGHT TO THE ALTAR AND THE PRIEST STOOD READY WITH HIS KNIFE WHEN OUT OF THE CLOUDS CAME THE GOLDEN RAM AND TOOK THEM ON HIS BACK AND VANISHED THEN MADNESS CAME UPON THAT FOOLISH KING ATHAMAS
AND IN HIS HANDS HE HELD A HARP OF GOLD AND STRUCK IT WITH A GOLDEN KEY AND AS HE STRUCK HE SANG TILL HIS EYES GLITTERED AND FILLED ALL THE CAVE WITH LIGHT AND HE SANG OF THE BIRTH OF TIME AND OF THE HEAVENS AND THE DANCING STARS
THE OLD HELLENS SAID THAT IT HUNG IN COLCHIS WHICH WE CALL THE CIRCASSIAN COAST NAILED TO A BEECH TREE IN THE WAR GOD'S WOOD AND THAT IT WAS THE FLEECE OF THE WONDROUS RAM WHO BORE PHRIXUS AND HELLE ACROSS THE EUXINE SEA
AND THERE WERE DARK AND SAD TALES ABOUT HIS BIRTH WHEN HE WAS A BABE HE WAS CAST OUT ON THE MOUNTAINS AND A WILD MARE CAME BY AND KICKED HIM BUT A SHEPHERD PASSING FOUND THE BABY WITH ITS FACE ALL BLACKENED BY THE BLOW
SAID MARY GIVING UP THE ROSES AND FOLDING HER ARMS BUT UNABLE TO LOOK UP WHENEVER YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO ME I FEEL HONORED BUT BEFORE I ENTER ON THAT QUESTION LET ME JUST TOUCH A POINT ON WHICH YOUR FATHER TOOK ME INTO CONFIDENCE
BUT THE RAM CARRIED THE TWO CHILDREN FAR AWAY OVER LAND AND SEA TILL HE CAME TO THE THRACIAN CHERSONESE AND THERE HELLE FELL INTO THE SEA SO THOSE NARROW STRAITS ARE CALLED HELLESPONT AFTER HER AND THEY BEAR THAT NAME UNTIL THIS DAY
YOUNG WOMEN ARE SEVERE THEY DON'T FEEL THE STRESS OF ACTION AS MEN DO THOUGH PERHAPS I OUGHT TO MAKE YOU AN EXCEPTION THERE BUT YOU DON'T PUT FRED VINCY ON SO LOW A LEVEL AS THAT NO INDEED HE HAS PLENTY OF SENSE
GOD BLESS YOU OH PLEASE STAY AND LET ME GIVE YOU SOME TEA SAID MARY HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS FOR SOMETHING INDEFINABLE SOMETHING LIKE THE RESOLUTE SUPPRESSION OF A PAIN IN MISTER FAREBROTHER'S MANNER MADE HER FEEL SUDDENLY MISERABLE
BECAUSE YOU HAD BEEN THE INNOCENT MEANS OF HINDERING FRED FROM GETTING HIS TEN THOUSAND POUNDS I HAVE KEPT THAT IN MIND AND I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING THAT MAY RELIEVE YOU ON THAT SCORE MAY SHOW YOU THAT NO SIN OFFERING IS DEMANDED FROM YOU THERE
ASCLEPIUS THE TOO WISE CHILD
SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT THAT ANY MAN COULD LOVE HER EXCEPT FRED WHO HAD ESPOUSED HER WITH THE UMBRELLA RING WHEN SHE WORE SOCKS AND LITTLE STRAPPED SHOES STILL LESS THAT SHE COULD BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE TO MISTER FAREBROTHER THE CLEVEREST MAN IN HER NARROW CIRCLE
AND DRANK OF THE CLEAR SPRING WATER FOR WINE IS NOT FIT FOR GROWING LADS AND WHEN THE REMNANTS WERE PUT AWAY THEY ALL LAY DOWN UPON THE SKINS AND LEAVES ABOUT THE FIRE AND EACH TOOK THE LYRE IN TURN AND SANG AND PLAYED WITH ALL HIS HEART
FRED PAUSED AGAIN AN INSTANT AND THEN REPEATED AND I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO
I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY NEW FEELING COMING TO MAKE THAT WEAKER I SHOULD LIKE BETTER THAN ANYTHING TO SEE HIM WORTHY OF EVERY ONE'S RESPECT BUT PLEASE TELL HIM I WILL NOT PROMISE TO MARRY HIM TILL THEN I SHOULD SHAME AND GRIEVE MY FATHER AND MOTHER
SAID THE VICAR RISING PUSHING HIS CHAIR AWAY AND LOOKING DOWN AT HIMSELF WHAT DO YOU SAY MOTHER YOU ARE A HANDSOME MAN CAMDEN THOUGH NOT SO FINE A FIGURE OF A MAN AS YOUR FATHER SAID THE OLD LADY I WISH YOU WOULD MARRY MISS GARTH BROTHER SAID MISS WINIFRED
AND YET WHAT ELSE AM I TO DO MY FATHER CAN'T SPARE ME ANY CAPITAL ELSE I MIGHT GO INTO FARMING AND HE HAS NO ROOM FOR ME IN HIS TRADE AND OF COURSE I CAN'T BEGIN TO STUDY FOR LAW OR PHYSIC NOW WHEN MY FATHER WANTS ME TO EARN SOMETHING
SHE DID NOT OBSERVE MISTER FAREBROTHER'S APPROACH ALONG THE GRASS AND HAD JUST STOOPED DOWN TO LECTURE A SMALL BLACK AND TAN TERRIER WHICH WOULD PERSIST IN WALKING ON THE SHEET AND SMELLING AT THE ROSE LEAVES AS MARY SPRINKLED THEM
AND AFTER A WHILE THEY ALL WENT OUT TO A PLOT OF GRASS AT THE CAVE'S MOUTH AND THERE THEY BOXED AND RAN AND WRESTLED AND LAUGHED TILL THE STONES FELL FROM THE CLIFFS THEN CHEIRON TOOK HIS LYRE AND ALL THE LADS JOINED HANDS
IT IS ONLY THAT I HAVE MY GIRLISH MOCKING WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS SAID MARY WITH A RETURNING SPARKLE OF PLAYFULNESS IN HER ANSWER WHICH ONLY MADE ITS MODESTY MORE CHARMING HE WISHES ME TO REPORT EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK SAID MISTER FAREBROTHER
OVER MARSH AND CRAG AND DOWN TILL THE BOY WAS TIRED AND FOOTSORE AND A ESON HAD TO BEAR HIM IN HIS ARMS TILL HE CAME TO THE MOUTH OF A LONELY CAVE AT THE FOOT OF A MIGHTY CLIFF ABOVE THE CLIFF THE SNOW WREATHS HUNG DRIPPING AND CRACKING IN THE SUN
TILL THE SUN SANK LOW BEHIND THE CLIFF AND A SHOUT WAS HEARD OUTSIDE AND THEN IN CAME THE SONS OF THE HEROES A ENEAS AND HERACLES AND PELEUS AND MANY ANOTHER MIGHTY NAME
WONDERING NOT AT MISTER FAREBROTHER'S MANNER BUT AT HIS TONE WHICH HAD A GRAVE RESTRAINED EMOTION IN IT WHEN THE STRANGE IDEA FLASHED ACROSS HER THAT HIS WORDS HAD REFERENCE TO HIMSELF SHE WAS INCREDULOUS AND ASHAMED OF ENTERTAINING IT
WHO WAS MAKING TENDER LITTLE BEAVER LIKE NOISES THERE SHALL BE SUGAR CANDY ALWAYS ON THE TABLE FOR YOU TO STEAL AND GIVE TO THE CHILDREN AND YOU SHALL HAVE A GREAT MANY NEW STOCKINGS TO MAKE PRESENTS OF AND YOU SHALL DARN YOUR OWN MORE THAN EVER
AND WHISPERED HOW HE HAD WATCHED THE SNAKE CAST ITS OLD SKIN AND GROW YOUNG AGAIN BEFORE HIS EYES AND HOW HE HAD GONE DOWN INTO A VILLAGE IN THE VALE AND CURED A DYING MAN WITH A HERB WHICH HE HAD SEEN A SICK GOAT EAT
FRED HESITATED AN INSTANT AND THEN WENT ON PLUNGINGLY I MIGHT GO INTO THE CHURCH NOW AND REALLY LOOK WHERE I MAY I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO
BY THE WAY IT WAS THAT VERY EVENING ON WHICH I ONCE BEFORE FULFILLED A MISSION FROM FRED JUST AFTER HE HAD GONE TO COLLEGE MISTER GARTH TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT OF FEATHERSTONE'S DEATH HOW YOU REFUSED TO BURN THE WILL AND HE SAID THAT YOU HAD SOME HEART PRICKINGS ON THAT SUBJECT
SO HE WENT UP FROM THE SEA ACROSS THE VALLEY THROUGH THE VINEYARDS AND THE OLIVE GROVES AND ACROSS THE TORRENT OF ANAUROS TOWARD PELION THE ANCIENT MOUNTAIN WHOSE BROWS ARE WHITE WITH SNOW HE WENT UP AND UP INTO THE MOUNTAIN
HOWEVER WISDOM LIES MORE IN THOSE TWO QUALITIES THAN PEOPLE ARE APT TO IMAGINE I HOPE YOU KNOW BY THOSE MARKS WHAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN I MEAN YES I THINK I DO SAID MARY BRAVELY HER FACE GETTING MORE SERIOUS AND HER HANDS COLD
FOR EACH OF US HAS A GOLDEN FLEECE TO SEEK AND A WILD SEA TO SAIL OVER ERE WE REACH IT AND DRAGONS TO FIGHT ERE IT BE OURS AND WHAT WAS THAT FIRST GOLDEN FLEECE I DO NOT KNOW NOR CARE
SIT DOWN FRED I'M READY TO HEAR AND DO ANYTHING I CAN SAID THE VICAR WHO WAS BUSY PACKING SOME SMALL OBJECTS FOR REMOVAL AND WENT ON WITH HIS WORK I WANTED TO TELL YOU
GO BACK IN PEACE AND BEND BEFORE THE STORM LIKE A PRUDENT MAN THIS BOY SHALL NOT CROSS THE ANAUROS AGAIN TILL HE HAS BECOME A GLORY TO YOU AND TO THE HOUSE OF A EOLUS AND A ESON WEPT OVER HIS SON AND WENT AWAY
AND CALLED THE LAD WITH A SOFT VOICE AND THE LAD RAN TREMBLING TO HIM AND WOULD HAVE LAID HIS HANDS UPON HIS KNEES BUT CHEIRON SMILED AND SAID CALL HITHER YOUR FATHER A ESON
WILL SHE NOT BE HURT AT MY INTRUSION
MARY ANSWERED WITH A SLIGHT RESENTMENT IN HER MANNER I MEAN THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO PUT SUCH QUESTIONS UNTIL HE HAS DONE SOMETHING WORTHY INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT HE COULD DO IT MISTER FAREBROTHER WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR MORE
NOT MY SORT OF LOVE
BUT I THINK HE WOULD NOT SHOW IT AS A CLERGYMAN HE WOULD BE A PIECE OF PROFESSIONAL AFFECTATION THEN THE ANSWER IS QUITE DECIDED AS A CLERGYMAN HE COULD HAVE NO HOPE MARY SHOOK HER HEAD
FOR I KNOW YOU AND ALL THAT HAS BEFALLEN AND SAW YOU BOTH AFAR IN THE VALLEY EVEN BEFORE YOU LEFT THE TOWN THEN A ESON CAME IN SADLY
WHICH GIVE AN OLD WOMAN A TOUCHING MOMENTARY IDENTITY WITH HER FAR OFF YOUTHFUL SELF AND SAYING DECISIVELY THE GREATEST COMFORT CAMDEN IS THAT YOU HAVE DESERVED IT WHEN A MAN GETS A GOOD BERTH MOTHER HALF THE DESERVING MUST COME AFTER
BUT THE BOY DID NOT WEEP SO FULL WAS HIS FANCY OF THAT STRANGE CAVE AND THE CENTAUR AND HIS SONG AND THE PLAYFELLOWS WHOM HE WAS TO SEE
I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY THAT I WILL EVER BE HIS WIFE MISTER FAREBROTHER BUT I CERTAINLY NEVER WILL BE HIS WIFE IF HE BECOMES A CLERGYMAN WHAT YOU SAY IS MOST GENEROUS AND KIND I DON'T MEAN FOR A MOMENT TO CORRECT YOUR JUDGMENT
I HAVE QUESTIONED HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND I CONFESS I SEE NO INSUPERABLE OBJECTION TO HIS BEING A CLERGYMAN AS THINGS GO HE SAYS THAT HE COULD TURN HIS MIND TO DOING HIS BEST IN THAT VOCATION ON ONE CONDITION
I THINK IT WOULD BE RATHER RIDICULOUS IN ME TO URGE SCRUPLES OF THAT SORT AS IF I WERE A JUDGE SAID FRED QUITE SIMPLY
MARY WAS SAYING IN A GRAVE CONTRALTO
BUT AT ITS FOOT AROUND THE CAVE'S MOUTH GREW ALL FAIR FLOWERS AND HERBS AS IF IN A GARDEN
THEREFORE WE WILL BELIEVE WHY SHOULD WE NOT OF THESE SAME ARGONAUTS OF OLD THAT THEY TOO WERE NOBLE MEN WHO PLANNED AND DID A NOBLE DEED AND THAT THEREFORE THEIR FAME HAS LIVED AND BEEN TOLD IN STORY AND IN SONG
IT WAS NOT FOR THE SAKE OF GOLD THAT THE LORD CAME DOWN AND DIED AND THE APOSTLES WENT OUT TO PREACH THE GOOD NEWS IN ALL LANDS THE SPARTANS LOOKED FOR NO REWARD IN MONEY WHEN THEY FOUGHT AND DIED AT THERMOPYLAE
I DO THINK SHE CARES ABOUT ME I SAW MISSUS GARTH LAST NIGHT AND SHE SAID THAT MARY WAS STAYING AT LOWICK RECTORY WITH MISS FAREBROTHER YES SHE IS VERY KINDLY HELPING MY SISTER
AND EVEN THE PORTRAITS OF THE GREAT LAWYERS SEEMED TO LOOK ON WITH SATISFACTION HIS MOTHER LEFT HER TEA AND TOAST UNTOUCHED BUT SAT WITH HER USUAL PRETTY PRIMNESS ONLY SHOWING HER EMOTION BY THAT FLUSH IN THE CHEEKS AND BRIGHTNESS IN THE EYES
BUT IF HE BRAVED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES OF GETTING HIS BREAD IN SOME OTHER WAY WILL YOU GIVE HIM THE SUPPORT OF HOPE MAY HE COUNT ON WINNING YOU I THINK FRED OUGHT NOT TO NEED TELLING AGAIN WHAT I HAVE ALREADY SAID TO HIM
SHE TOOK HIS FORE PAWS IN ONE HAND AND LIFTED UP THE FOREFINGER OF THE OTHER WHILE THE DOG WRINKLED HIS BROWS AND LOOKED EMBARRASSED
AND RUIN UPON INO AND HER CHILDREN FOR ATHAMAS KILLED ONE OF THEM IN HIS FURY AND INO FLED FROM HIM WITH THE OTHER IN HER ARMS AND LEAPED FROM A CLIFF INTO THE SEA AND WAS CHANGED INTO A DOLPHIN SUCH AS YOU HAVE SEEN
OF COURSE IF I AM OBLIGED TO BE A CLERGYMAN I SHALL TRY AND DO MY DUTY THOUGH I MAYN'T LIKE IT
OUR DISCOVERERS DID NOT GO TO MAKE THEMSELVES RICH WHEN THEY SAILED OUT ONE AFTER ANOTHER INTO THE DREARY FROZEN SEAS NOR DID THE LADIES WHO WENT OUT LAST YEAR TO DRUDGE IN THE HOSPITALS OF THE EAST MAKING THEMSELVES POOR THAT THEY MIGHT BE RICH IN NOBLE WORKS
AND A ESON WHEN HE WAS DRIVEN OUT WENT SADLY AWAY OUT OF THE TOWN LEADING HIS LITTLE SON BY THE HAND AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF I MUST HIDE THE CHILD IN THE MOUNTAINS OR PELIAS WILL SURELY KILL HIM BECAUSE HE IS THE HEIR
HE HAS WORKED HIS WAY SO FAR AND NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS HE TO DO
YET I FELT THAT I OUGHT NOT TO LET IT BE USED BY SOME ONE ELSE INSTEAD OF ME IT IS I WHO AM BOUND TO ACT SO THAT YOU WILL NOT REGRET YOUR POWER SAID MISTER FAREBROTHER HIS WAS ONE OF THE NATURES IN WHICH CONSCIENCE GETS THE MORE ACTIVE WHEN THE YOKE OF LIFE CEASES TO GALL THEM
AND WHEN A FAMINE CAME UPON THE LAND THEIR CRUEL STEP MOTHER INO WISHED TO KILL THEM THAT HER OWN CHILDREN MIGHT REIGN
SO ON THAT SCORE YOU MAY FEEL YOUR MIND FREE THANK YOU MISTER FAREBROTHER SAID MARY EARNESTLY I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR REMEMBERING MY FEELINGS WELL NOW I MAY GO ON
AND THEN AS THEY TURNED AND PAUSED UNDER THE SHADOW OF A MAPLE AT THE END OF A GRASSY WALK SAID I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU RESIST ANY ATTEMPT TO FETTER YOU BUT EITHER YOUR FEELING FOR FRED VINCY EXCLUDES YOUR ENTERTAINING ANOTHER ATTACHMENT OR IT DOES NOT
WHICH WANDERS OVER THE WAVES FOR EVER SIGHING WITH ITS LITTLE ONE CLASPED TO ITS BREAST BUT THE PEOPLE DROVE OUT KING ATHAMAS BECAUSE HE HAD KILLED HIS CHILD AND HE ROAMED ABOUT IN HIS MISERY TILL HE CAME TO THE ORACLE IN DELPHI
THEN HE SANG OF HEALTH AND STRENGTH AND MANHOOD AND A VALIANT HEART AND OF MUSIC AND HUNTING AND WRESTLING AND ALL THE GAMES WHICH HEROES LOVE AND OF TRAVEL AND WARS AND SIEGES AND A NOBLE DEATH IN FIGHT AND THEN HE SANG OF PEACE AND PLENTY
WHO DARE SAIL TO COLCHIS OR BRING HOME THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND IN ALL THE COUNTRY NONE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO TRY IT FOR THE MAN AND THE TIME WERE NOT COME
THAT THEY MIGHT FIGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY AND THEIR QUEEN NO CHILDREN THERE IS A BETTER THING ON EARTH THAN WEALTH A BETTER THING THAN LIFE ITSELF AND THAT IS TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING BEFORE YOU DIE FOR WHICH GOOD MEN MAY HONOUR YOU AND GOD YOUR FATHER SMILE UPON YOUR WORK
MISSUS FAREBROTHER ALWAYS CALLED HER TINY OLD SISTER BY THAT MAGNIFICENT NAME I SHALL DO WITHOUT WHIST NOW MOTHER
MISS WINIFRED WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER BROTHER ALL THE WHILE AND CRYING HEARTILY WHICH WAS HER WAY OF REJOICING SMILED THROUGH HER TEARS AND SAID YOU MUST SET ME THE EXAMPLE CAM YOU MUST MARRY NOW WITH ALL MY HEART
AND ONE CRIED I HAVE KILLED TWO DEER AND ANOTHER I TOOK A WILD CAT AMONG THE CRAGS
THE STRONGER THING IS NOT TO GIVE UP POWER BUT TO USE IT WELL I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID DOROTHEA
BUT I CAN NEVER IMAGINE HIM PREACHING AND EXHORTING AND PRONOUNCING BLESSINGS AND PRAYING BY THE SICK WITHOUT FEELING AS IF I WERE LOOKING AT A CARICATURE
MARY'S CHEEKS HAD BEGUN TO BURN A LITTLE AND SHE WAS MUTE I MEAN THAT YOUR ACTION MADE NO REAL DIFFERENCE TO FRED'S LOT I FIND THAT THE FIRST WILL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LEGALLY GOOD AFTER THE BURNING OF THE LAST IT WOULD NOT HAVE STOOD IF IT HAD BEEN DISPUTED
THEN I HAVE FULFILLED MY COMMISSION THOROUGHLY SAID MISTER FAREBROTHER PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO MARY AND I SHALL RIDE BACK TO MIDDLEMARCH FORTHWITH WITH THIS PROSPECT BEFORE HIM WE SHALL GET FRED INTO THE RIGHT NICHE SOMEHOW AND I HOPE I SHALL LIVE TO JOIN YOUR HANDS
MISS NOBLE NODDED AT HER NEPHEW WITH A SUBDUED HALF FRIGHTENED LAUGH
IF THAT CONDITION WERE FULFILLED I WOULD DO MY UTMOST IN HELPING FRED ON AFTER A TIME NOT OF COURSE AT FIRST HE MIGHT BE WITH ME AS MY CURATE AND HE WOULD HAVE SO MUCH TO DO THAT HIS STIPEND WOULD BE NEARLY WHAT I USED TO GET AS VICAR
WHO WAS KING IN IOLCOS BY THE SEA THERE HE RULED OVER THE RICH MINUAN HEROES AS ATHAMAS HIS UNCLE RULED IN BOEOTIA AND LIKE ATHAMAS HE WAS AN UNHAPPY MAN FOR HE HAD A STEP BROTHER NAMED PELIAS OF WHOM SOME SAID THAT HE WAS A NYMPH'S SON
LIKE A DREAM WHICH YOU DREAMT LAST YEAR AND WHY THEY WENT I CANNOT TELL SOME SAY THAT IT WAS TO WIN GOLD
I COULD NOT LOVE A MAN WHO IS RIDICULOUS SAID MARY NOT CHOOSING TO GO DEEPER FRED HAS SENSE AND KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM RESPECTABLE IF HE LIKES IN SOME GOOD WORLDLY BUSINESS
SIT HERE BY ME TILL SUNDOWN WHEN YOUR PLAYFELLOWS WILL COME HOME AND YOU SHALL LEARN LIKE THEM TO BE A KING WORTHY TO RULE OVER GALLANT MEN
FRED'S VOICE HAD TAKEN A TONE OF GRUMBLING REMONSTRANCE AND MISTER FAREBROTHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO SMILE IF HIS MIND HAD NOT BEEN TOO BUSY IN IMAGINING MORE THAN FRED TOLD HIM HAVE YOU ANY DIFFICULTIES ABOUT DOCTRINES ABOUT THE ARTICLES
AND COENEUS CARRIED A BEAR CUB UNDER EACH ARM AND LAUGHED WHEN THEY SCRATCHED AND BIT FOR NEITHER TOOTH NOR STEEL COULD WOUND HIM
WHY CAMEST YOU NOT YOURSELF TO ME A ESON THE A EOLID AND A ESON SAID
BUT PERHAPS IT WILL BE BETTER TO TRY AND MAKE AS GOOD A CLERGYMAN OUT OF MYSELF AS I CAN THAT IS THE WELL BENEFICED POINT OF VIEW YOU PERCEIVE FROM WHICH DIFFICULTIES ARE MUCH SIMPLIFIED HE ENDED SMILING THE VICAR DID FEEL THEN AS IF HIS SHARE OF DUTIES WOULD BE EASY
AND OF EQUAL JUSTICE IN THE LAND AND AS HE SANG THE BOY LISTENED WIDE EYED AND FORGOT HIS ERRAND IN THE SONG
I SHOULD NEVER BE QUITE HAPPY IF I THOUGHT HE WAS UNHAPPY FOR THE LOSS OF ME
THERE THEY GREW GAILY IN THE SUNSHINE AND THE SPRAY OF THE TORRENT FROM ABOVE WHILE FROM THE CAVE CAME THE SOUND OF MUSIC AND A MAN'S VOICE SINGING TO THE HARP THEN A ESON PUT DOWN THE LAD AND WHISPERED FEAR NOT BUT GO IN
BUT YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I CAN CONSULT
AND WHOMSOEVER YOU SHALL FIND LAY YOUR HANDS UPON HIS KNEES AND SAY IN THE NAME OF ZEUS THE FATHER OF GODS AND MEN I AM YOUR GUEST FROM THIS DAY FORTH THEN THE LAD WENT IN WITHOUT TREMBLING FOR HE TOO WAS A HERO'S SON
SAID THE SON BRIMFUL OF PLEASURE AND NOT TRYING TO CONCEAL IT THE GLADNESS IN HIS FACE WAS OF THAT ACTIVE KIND WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE ENERGY ENOUGH NOT ONLY TO FLASH OUTWARDLY BUT TO LIGHT UP BUSY VISION WITHIN
BUT IN HIS HEART HE FELT RATHER ASHAMED THAT HIS CONDUCT HAD SHOWN LACHES WHICH OTHERS WHO DID NOT GET BENEFICES WERE FREE FROM I USED OFTEN TO WISH I HAD BEEN SOMETHING ELSE THAN A CLERGYMAN HE SAID TO LYDGATE
AND THE SHAPING OF THE WONDROUS EARTH AND HE SANG OF THE TREASURES OF THE HILLS AND THE HIDDEN JEWELS OF THE MINE AND THE VEINS OF FIRE AND METAL AND THE VIRTUES OF ALL HEALING HERBS AND OF THE SPEECH OF BIRDS AND OF PROPHECY AND OF HIDDEN THINGS TO COME
MARY LOOKED SO MUCH MOVED THAT HE SAID AFTER A MOMENT LET US WALK A LITTLE AND WHEN THEY WERE WALKING HE ADDED TO SPEAK QUITE PLAINLY FRED WILL NOT TAKE ANY COURSE WHICH WOULD LESSEN THE CHANCE THAT YOU WOULD CONSENT TO BE HIS WIFE
AS FOR YOU WINNY THE VICAR WENT ON I SHALL MAKE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT YOUR MARRYING ANY LOWICK BACHELOR MISTER SOLOMON FEATHERSTONE FOR EXAMPLE AS SOON AS I FIND YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH HIM
FRED PAUSED A MOMENT AND THEN SAID RATHER COMPLAININGLY
THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE BEFORE MISTER FAREBROTHER LAID DOWN HIS WORK AND PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TO FRED SAID VERY WELL MY BOY I WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH THAT VERY DAY MISTER FAREBROTHER WENT TO LOWICK PARSONAGE ON THE NAG WHICH HE HAD JUST SET UP
YOU MUST SAIL OVER THE SEA TO COLCHIS AND BRING HOME THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND THEN MY SPIRIT WILL COME BACK WITH IT AND I SHALL SLEEP WITH MY FATHERS AND HAVE REST HE CAME THUS AND CALLED TO THEM OFTEN BUT WHEN THEY WOKE THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SAID
BUT NOT WITH YOUNG GENTLEMEN OH WITH SOME I SUPPOSE SINCE SOME OF THEM TURN INTO EXCELLENT MEN
TO EACH ATHENE AND APOLLO GIVE SOME GIFT AND EACH IS WORTHY IN HIS PLACE BUT TO THIS CHILD THEY HAVE GIVEN AN HONOUR BEYOND ALL HONOURS TO CURE WHILE OTHERS KILL THEN THE LADS BROUGHT IN WOOD AND SPLIT IT AND LIGHTED A BLAZING FIRE
THE YOUNG GROWTHS ARE PUSHING ME ASIDE HE FOUND MARY IN THE GARDEN GATHERING ROSES AND SPRINKLING THE PETALS ON A SHEET THE SUN WAS LOW AND TALL TREES SENT THEIR SHADOWS ACROSS THE GRASSY WALKS WHERE MARY WAS MOVING WITHOUT BONNET OR PARASOL
AS IF IT WERE AN INSTITUTION FOR GETTING UP IDIOTS GENTEELLY AS IF MARY CHECKED HERSELF
MERELY THAT I DON'T LIKE IT I DON'T LIKE DIVINITY AND PREACHING AND FEELING OBLIGED TO LOOK SERIOUS I LIKE RIDING ACROSS COUNTRY AND DOING AS OTHER MEN DO I DON'T MEAN THAT I WANT TO BE A BAD FELLOW IN ANY WAY BUT I'VE NO TASTE FOR THE SORT OF THING PEOPLE EXPECT OF A CLERGYMAN
AND SOCRATES THE WISE ASKED NO PAY FROM HIS COUNTRYMEN BUT LIVED POOR AND BAREFOOT ALL HIS DAYS ONLY CARING TO MAKE MEN GOOD AND THERE ARE HEROES IN OUR DAYS ALSO WHO DO NOBLE DEEDS BUT NOT FOR GOLD
AND THE LAD DANCED WITH THEM DELIGHTED AND THEN SLEPT A WHOLESOME SLEEP UPON FRAGRANT LEAVES OF BAY AND MYRTLE AND MARJORAM AND FLOWERS OF THYME AND ROSE AT THE DAWN AND BATHED IN THE TORRENT AND BECAME A SCHOOLFELLOW TO THE HEROES SONS
NO I WANT TO ASK A GREAT FAVOR OF YOU I AM ASHAMED TO BOTHER YOU IN THIS WAY BUT MARY MIGHT LISTEN TO WHAT YOU SAID IF YOU MENTIONED THE SUBJECT TO HER I MEAN ABOUT MY GOING INTO THE CHURCH THAT IS RATHER A DELICATE TASK MY DEAR FRED
SOMETHING VERY LIKE YOUR TEMPLE YOU KNOW ONLY QUITE DIFFERENT I TAKE YOUR MEANING SAID THE PHOENIX I WOULD FAIN SEE THESE CALLING THEMSELVES SONS OF THE PHOENIX BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR WORDS OF WISDOM
IT SOUNDS CHILLY
WHAT I MUST TELL YOU IS THAT THOUGH CYRIL AND JANE AND ROBERT AND ANTHEA ENJOYED IT AS MUCH AS ANY CHILDREN POSSIBLY COULD THE PLEASURE OF THE PHOENIX WAS FAR FAR GREATER THAN THEIRS
MERELY A CONVENIENT FICTION THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TIME
WERE MAGIC TORCHES LIGHTED FOR ITS SAKE AND IT WAS SO CHARMED WITH THE FOOTLIGHTS THAT THE CHILDREN COULD HARDLY PERSUADE IT TO SIT STILL BUT WHEN THE LIMELIGHT WAS SHOWN IT COULD CONTAIN ITS APPROVAL NO LONGER
FOUR LONG BREATHS OF DEEP RELIEF WERE INSTANTLY BREATHED THE DRAUGHT WHICH THEY HAD NEVER LIKED BEFORE WAS FOR THE MOMENT QUITE PLEASANT AND THEY WERE SAFE AND EVERY ONE ELSE WAS SAFE
A MAGNIFICENT IDEA SAID THE PHOENIX COMPLACENTLY AN ENORMOUS ALTAR FIRE SUPPLIED FREE OF CHARGE DOESN'T THE INCENSE SMELL DELICIOUS
I DON'T THINK SO SAID CYRIL IT'S CALLED THE WATER BABIES AND IF IT'S LIKE THE BOOK THERE ISN'T ANY GLADIATING IN IT THERE ARE CHIMNEY SWEEPS AND PROFESSORS AND A LOBSTER AND AN OTTER AND A SALMON AND CHILDREN LIVING IN THE WATER
SHE DID NOT KNOW IT WAS A MAGIC CARPET AND NO ONE WANTS TO BE LAUGHED AT FOR TRYING TO MEND AN ORDINARY CARPET WITH LAMP OIL WELL DON'T DO IT AGAIN SAID MOTHER AND NOW AWAY WITH MELANCHOLY FATHER HAS SENT A TELEGRAM LOOK
WE COULDN'T FIND YOU OF COURSE AND WE COULDN'T GET IN BUT THE FIREMEN TOLD US EVERY ONE WAS SAFELY OUT
AND RELEASE THE CRUSHED AND DISHEVELLED PHOENIX ROBERT HAD TO ARRANGE HIS DAMP HAIR AT THE LOOKING GLASS AT THE BACK OF THE BOX AND THE PHOENIX HAD TO PREEN ITS DISORDERED FEATHERS FOR SOME TIME BEFORE EITHER OF THEM WAS FIT TO BE SEEN
ROBERT LOOKED ROUND TO SEE IF THE BIRD HAD OVERHEARD A SPEECH WHICH HOWEVER NATURAL WAS HARDLY POLITE OR GRATEFUL THE PHOENIX WAS GONE LOOK HERE SAID CYRIL
A CARPET DOESN'T HAVE AN EASY LIFE OF IT IN THIS ROOM DOES IT IT'S NOT OUR FAULT MOTHER IS IT THAT OUR BOOTS ARE THE REALLY RELIABLE KIND ROBERT ASKED THE QUESTION MORE IN SORROW THAN IN ANGER
HUSH SAID ROBERT IT'S NO USE BEING RUDE TO THE BIRD I SUPPOSE IT CAN'T HELP ITS NATURE PERHAPS WE'D BETTER WASH TOO NOW I COME TO THINK OF IT MY HANDS ARE RATHER NO ONE HAD NOTICED THE PHOENIX
MOTHER WAS VERY CLEVER BUT EVEN SHE COULD NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND THE COOK'S ACCOUNTS THE LAMB WAS VERY GLAD TO HAVE HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO PLAY WITH HIM HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THEM A BIT
BOUGHT SUCH A BAD BARGAIN AS THAT CARPET A SOFT OH
AND THAT IS A MISFORTUNE WHICH I REALLY DO NOT THINK I COULD ENDURE BUT DO NOT LET ME INTRUDE THESE DESPERATE PERSONAL REFLECTIONS ON YOUR YOUTHFUL HAPPINESS WHAT IS THE SHOW AT THE THEATRE TO NIGHT WRESTLERS GLADIATORS
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS ENTIRELY THE FAULT OF THE PHOENIX IT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST THE FAULT OF THE THEATRE PEOPLE AND NO ONE COULD EVER UNDERSTAND AFTERWARDS HOW IT DID HAPPEN NO ONE THAT IS
THE ONLY SMELL WAS THE STIFLING SMELL OF SMOKE OF BURNING SILK OR SCORCHING VARNISH THE LITTLE FLAMES HAD OPENED NOW INTO GREAT FLAME FLOWERS THE PEOPLE IN THE THEATRE WERE SHOUTING AND PRESSING TOWARDS THE DOORS
I DON'T SUPPOSE THERE WILL BE REAL WATER SAID JANE AND THEATRES ARE VERY WARM AND PRETTY WITH A LOT OF GOLD AND LAMPS WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO COME WITH US
BUT WE LIKE THEM TO KNOW IT UNLESS WE ARE THE VERY BEST AND NOBLEST KIND OF PEOPLE AND ROBERT WAS JUST ORDINARY
A DEEP BREATH WAS DRAWN BY HUNDREDS OF LUNGS EVERY EYE IN THE HOUSE TURNED TO THE BOX WHERE THE LUCKLESS CHILDREN CRINGED AND MOST PEOPLE HISSED OR SAID SHISH OR TURN THEM OUT
IT IS SO WONDERFUL AND WIDE I LIKE TO SEE IT FROM OUTSIDE WELL YOU SEE CYRIL WAS SAYING IT'S JUST THE OLD BOTHER MOTHER CAN'T BELIEVE THE REAL TRUE TRUTH ABOUT THE CARPET AND
OF WHOM YOU SPEAK MAY HELP ME TO FORGET THE WEIGHT OF MY YEARS SO THAT EVENING THE PHOENIX SNUGGED INSIDE THE WAISTCOAT OF ROBERT'S ETONS
SINCE IT HAD BIDDEN THEM TO STEP ON THE CARPET AND NO ONE NOTICED THAT NO ONE HAD NOTICED ALL WERE PARTIALLY CLEAN AND CYRIL WAS JUST PLUNGING INTO HIS GREAT COAT TO GO AND LOOK FOR HIS PARENTS HE
FOR WHICH EVERY ONE KEPT LOOKING ANXIOUSLY BY FOUR O'CLOCK JANE WAS ALMOST SURE THAT SEVERAL HAIRS WERE BEGINNING TO GROW THE PHOENIX PERCHED ON THE FENDER AND ITS CONVERSATION AS USUAL WAS ENTERTAINING AND INSTRUCTIVE
THAT YOU ARE NOT TO PLAY WITH PARAFFIN WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WE HAVE BURNT A PARAFFINY RAG ANTHEA ANSWERED IT WAS NO USE TELLING MOTHER WHAT THEY HAD DONE TO THE CARPET
AND WAS TAKEN TO THE PLAY ROBERT HAD TO PRETEND TO BE COLD AT THE GLITTERING MANY MIRRORED RESTAURANT WHERE THEY ATE DINNER WITH FATHER IN EVENING DRESS WITH A VERY SHINY WHITE SHIRT FRONT
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN SHOCK HEADED PETER LAST YEAR YOUR WORDS ARE STRANGE SAID THE PHOENIX BUT I WILL COME WITH YOU
HE WRIGGLES EVEN IN HIS SLEEP CROCKY SAID THE LAMB AND SHOWED ALL HIS LITTLE TEETH SO ANTHEA WENT ON I LOVE MY LITTLE CROCODILE I LOVE HIS TRUTHFUL TOOTHFUL SMILE
AND ALL ROUND THE THEATRE WHERE IT HAD PASSED LITTLE SPARKS SHONE LIKE TINSEL SEEDS THEN LITTLE SMOKE WREATHS CURLED UP LIKE GROWING PLANTS
WHEN DINNER WAS FINISHED TO THE LAST GRAPE AND THE LAST PADDLE IN THE FINGER GLASSES FOR IT WAS A REALLY TRULY GROWN UP DINNER THE CHILDREN WERE TAKEN TO THE THEATRE GUIDED TO A BOX CLOSE TO THE STAGE AND LEFT
WISDOM IS ALWAYS WELCOME SAID THE PHOENIX PRETTY POLLY REMARKED THE LAMB REACHING HIS HANDS TOWARDS THE GOLDEN SPEAKER THE PHOENIX MODESTLY RETREATED BEHIND ROBERT AND ANTHEA HASTENED
WELL THEN I SHOULD SAY YOU WERE SICKENING FOR SOMETHING MUMPS OR MEASLES OR THRUSH OR TEETHING GOODBYE HE WENT AND ROBERT WAS AT LAST ABLE TO REMOVE HIS COAT MOP HIS PERSPIRING BROW
IN YOUR MIND PERHAPS SAID JANE BUT IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD IN YOUR BODY YOU'D GET TOO BALLOONY THE PHOENIX YAWNED LOOK HERE SAID ANTHEA I REALLY HAVE AN IDEA
BUT OH HE HAS A DREADFUL HABIT OF PADDLING OUT AMONG THE ROCKS AND SOAKING BOTH HIS BUNNY SOCKS I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE ABOUT THE SONS OF THE PHOENIX REALLY SAID ROBERT
THE THEATRE HAD BEEN QUITE EMPTY WHEN THEY LEFT EVERY ONE WAS SURE OF THAT THEY PRESENTLY FOUND THEMSELVES ALL TALKING AT ONCE SOMEHOW NONE OF THEIR ADVENTURES HAD GIVEN THEM SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT NONE OTHER HAD SEEMED SO REAL
IT FLAPPED ITS GOLDEN WINGS AND CRIED IN A VOICE THAT COULD BE HEARD ALL OVER THE THEATRE WELL DONE MY SERVANTS YE HAVE MY FAVOUR AND MY COUNTENANCE LITTLE TOM ON THE STAGE STOPPED SHORT IN WHAT HE WAS SAYING
TWENTY TWO AND NINEPENCE IT OUGHT TO HAVE LASTED FOR YEARS IT'S SIMPLY DREADFUL NOW WELL NEVER MIND DARLINGS YOU'VE DONE YOUR BEST I THINK WE'LL HAVE COCONUT MATTING NEXT TIME
I MEAN THE GREY ONE WITH THE RED TAIL ALL EYES WERE ON THE STAGE WHERE THE LOBSTER WAS DELIGHTING THE AUDIENCE WITH THAT GEM OF A SONG IF YOU CAN'T WALK STRAIGHT WALK SIDEWAYS WHEN THE PHOENIX MURMURED WARMLY
RUN AND GET OUT YOUR FROCKS THE FROCKS DID WANT IRONING WANTED IT RATHER BADLY AS IT HAPPENED FOR BEING OF TOMATO COLOURED LIBERTY SILK
NO BOYS ON BURNING DECKS FOR ME THANK YOU NOT MUCH SAID CYRIL AND HE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE BOX BUT A FIERCE WAFT OF SMOKE AND HOT AIR MADE HIM SHUT IT AGAIN IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO GET OUT THAT WAY
AND THE OTHER WAS BUT A HUMBLE SHRINE FREQUENTED BY OUTCASTS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OUTCASTS SAID ROBERT BUT YOU CAN CALL THIS YOUR TEMPLE IF YOU LIKE HUSH THE MUSIC IS BEGINNING
THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TATCHO FOR HAD PARAFFIN RUBBED INTO THEM WITH A PIECE OF FLANNEL THEN THE FLANNEL WAS BURNED IT MADE A GAY FLAME WHICH DELIGHTED THE PHOENIX AND THE LAMB HOW OFTEN SAID MOTHER OPENING THE DOOR
DON'T SPEAK AGAIN THERE'S A DEAR SAID ANTHEA YOU WOULDN'T LIKE TO INTERFERE WITH YOUR OWN TEMPLE WOULD YOU SO NOW THE PHOENIX WAS QUIET BUT IT KEPT WHISPERING TO THE CHILDREN
WHICH IS NOT MANNERS ROBERT THOUGHT FATHER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN QUITE SO FUNNY ABOUT HIS KEEPING HIS OVER COAT ON IF FATHER HAD KNOWN ALL THE TRUTH
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THAT SAID ROBERT IN INJURED TONES ONLY I KNOW HOW RUDE IT IS TO INTERRUPT DO COME PHOENIX OLD CHAP IT WILL CHEER YOU UP
IT FLUTTERED OFF AND THEN SOME ONE SAID IN THE OTHER EAR THEY'RE SAFE AT HOME AND WHEN I TURNED AGAIN TO SEE WHO IT WAS SPEAKING HANGED IF THERE WASN'T THAT CONFOUNDED PIGEON ON MY OTHER SHOULDER DAZED BY THE FIRE I SUPPOSE
EXCEPT THE GUILTY BIRD ITSELF AND THE FOUR CHILDREN THE PHOENIX WAS BALANCING ITSELF ON THE GILT BACK OF THE CHAIR SWAYING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AND UP AND DOWN AS YOU MAY SEE YOUR OWN DOMESTIC PARROT DO
WHICH COOK GAVE HER ON DIRTY BITS OF PAPER AND WHICH WERE SUPPOSED TO EXPLAIN HOW IT WAS THAT COOK HAD ONLY FIVEPENCE HALF PENNY AND A LOT OF UNPAID BILLS LEFT OUT OF ALL THE MONEY MOTHER HAD SENT HER FOR HOUSE KEEPING
AND INDEED THE CROWD ROUND THE DOORS LOOKED AS THICK AS FLIES IN THE JAM MAKING SEASON I WISH WE'D NEVER SEEN THE PHOENIX CRIED JANE EVEN AT THAT AWFUL MOMENT
WHAT RADIANT RITES AND ALL TO DO HONOUR TO ME THE SONGS IN THE PLAY IT TOOK TO BE HYMNS IN ITS HONOUR THE CHORUSES WERE CHORIC SONGS IN ITS PRAISE THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS IT SAID
ONLY DO WASH YOUR FACE FIRST MOTHER WILL BE SURE TO THINK YOU ARE BURNT TO A CINDER IF SHE SEES YOU AS BLACK AS THAT AND SHE'LL FAINT OR BE ILL OR SOMETHING OH I WISH WE'D NEVER GOT TO KNOW THAT PHOENIX
DID YOU NOTICE THEY SAID AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN SUDDENLY ANTHEA'S FACE TURNED PALE UNDER THE DIRT WHICH IT HAD COLLECTED ON IT DURING THE FIRE OH SHE CRIED
THIS CONVERSATION WAS AT BREAKFAST AND THE LAMB HAD BEEN BEAUTIFULLY GOOD UNTIL EVERY ONE WAS LOOKING AT THE CARPET AND THEN IT WAS FOR HIM BUT THE WORK OF A MOMENT TO TURN A GLASS DISH OF SYRUPY BLACKBERRY JAM
LOOK HERE LEAVE ENOUGH IN THE BOTTLE TO WET FATHER'S HEAD ALL OVER WITH IN CASE ANY EMERGENCY EMERGES AND LET'S MAKE UP WITH PARAFFIN I EXPECT IT'S THE SMELL THAT DOES THE GOOD REALLY AND THE SMELL'S EXACTLY THE SAME
THEY LOOKED OVER THE FRONT OF THE BOX COULD THEY CLIMB DOWN IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE CERTAINLY BUT WOULD THEY BE MUCH BETTER OFF LOOK AT THE PEOPLE MOANED ANTHEA WE COULDN'T GET THROUGH
AND I'M CERTAIN IT'LL SEE US THROUGH SOMEHOW I BELIEVE IN THE PHOENIX THE PHOENIX THANKS YOU O ROBERT SAID A GOLDEN VOICE AT HIS FEET AND THERE WAS THE PHOENIX ITSELF ON THE WISHING CARPET QUICK IT SAID
FOR THE PHOENIX SPENT THE NIGHT IN PUTTING THINGS STRAIGHT HOW THE MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTED FOR THIS AND HOW MANY OF THE THEATRE OFFICIALS STILL BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE MAD ON THAT NIGHT WILL NEVER BE KNOWN NEXT DAY MOTHER SAW THE BURNT HOLES IN THE CARPET
AND INSTANTLY BECAME A BABY SNAKE HISSING AND WRIGGLING AND CREEPING IN ANTHEA'S ARMS AS SHE SAID I LOVE MY LITTLE BABY SNAKE HE HISSES WHEN HE IS AWAKE HE CREEPS WITH SUCH A WRIGGLY CREEP
AND MOTHER LOOKING LOVELY IN HER GREY EVENING DRESS THAT CHANGES INTO PINK AND GREEN WHEN SHE MOVES ROBERT PRETENDED THAT HE WAS TOO COLD TO TAKE OFF HIS GREAT COAT
I SAID IT WAS THE BIRD THAT SPOKE SAID MOTHER AND SO IT WAS OR AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO THEN IT WASN'T A PIGEON IT WAS AN ORANGE COLOURED COCKATOO I DON'T CARE WHO IT WAS THAT SPOKE
AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS KNEELING ON THE LINOLEUM OF THE HALL TRYING TO KISS FOUR DAMP CHILDREN AT ONCE AND LAUGHING AND CRYING BY TURNS WHILE FATHER STOOD LOOKING ON AND SAYING HE WAS BLESSED OR SOMETHING
CYRIL ANTHEA ROBERT AND JANE AND SOMETHING TOUCHED ME ON THE SHOULDER
PEOPLE WHISPERED THEN PEOPLE SHRIEKED FIRE FIRE THE CURTAIN WENT DOWN THE LIGHTS WENT UP FIRE CRIED EVERY ONE AND MADE FOR THE DOORS
WELL YOU TALK AND DECIDE SAID ANTHEA HERE YOU LOVELY DUCKY LAMB COME TO PANTHER AND PLAY NOAH'S ARK THE LAMB CAME WITH HIS PRETTY HAIR ALL TUMBLED AND HIS FACE ALL DUSTY
IT WANTED TO KNOW WHY THERE WAS NO ALTAR NO FIRE NO INCENSE AND BECAME SO EXCITED AND FRETFUL AND TIRESOME THAT FOUR AT LEAST OF THE PARTY OF FIVE WISHED DEEPLY THAT IT HAD BEEN LEFT AT HOME
THERE WAS ALSO CLIMBING VESUVIUS IN THIS GAME THE BABY WALKS UP YOU AND WHEN HE IS STANDING ON YOUR SHOULDERS YOU SHOUT AS LOUD AS YOU CAN WHICH IS THE RUMBLING OF THE BURNING MOUNTAIN AND THEN TUMBLE HIM GENTLY ON TO THE FLOOR
HOW FAR FAIRER THAN MY TEMPLE OR HAVE I GUESSED ARIGHT HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME HITHER TO LIFT UP MY HEART WITH EMOTIONS OF JOYOUS SURPRISE TELL ME MY ROBERT IS IT NOT THAT THIS THIS IS MY TRUE TEMPLE
I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE PLAY AS I SAID BEFORE ONE CAN'T TELL EVERYTHING AND NO DOUBT YOU SAW THE WATER BABIES YOURSELVES IF YOU DID NOT IT WAS A SHAME OR RATHER A PITY
BUT HOW DID YOU GUESS WE'D COME HOME SAID CYRIL LATER WHEN EVERY ONE WAS CALM ENOUGH FOR TALKING WELL IT WAS RATHER A RUM THING WE HEARD THE GARRICK WAS ON FIRE AND OF COURSE WE WENT STRAIGHT THERE SAID FATHER BRISKLY
TO DISTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE LAMB BY MURMURING
STAND ON THOSE PORTIONS OF THE CARPET WHICH ARE TRULY ANTIQUE AND AUTHENTIC AND A SUDDEN JET OF FLAME STOPPED ITS WORDS ALAS THE PHOENIX HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY WARMED TO ITS SUBJECT AND IN THE UNINTENTIONAL HEAT OF THE MOMENT
AND NOTHING MORE WAS SAID JUST THEN ABOUT ITS BADNESS AS A BARGAIN AND ABOUT WHAT MOTHER HOPED FOR FROM COCONUT MATTING WHEN THE LAMB WAS CLEAN AGAIN HE HAD TO BE TAKEN CARE OF WHILE MOTHER RUMPLED HER HAIR AND INKED HER FINGERS
WHEN ONE OF THE PILLOWS BURST AND THE YOUTHFUL PRINCES WERE SO COVERED WITH FEATHERS THAT THE PICTURE MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BEEN CALLED MICHAELMAS EVE OR PLUCKING THE GEESE
IF HE HADN'T ANYTHING TO PUT ON IT IT MIGHT ALL DROP OFF BEFORE ELIZA HAD TIME TO GET ROUND TO THE CHEMIST'S FOR ANOTHER BOTTLE IT WOULD BE DREADFUL TO HAVE A BALD FATHER
I AM OLD I AM WEARY I FEEL AS IF I OUGHT TO LAY MY EGG AND LAY ME DOWN TO MY FIERY SLEEP BUT UNLESS I'M CAREFUL I SHALL BE HATCHED AGAIN INSTANTLY
THEN THE PLAY WENT ON AND AN ATTENDANT PRESENTLY CAME TO THE BOX AND SPOKE WRATHFULLY IT WASN'T US INDEED IT WASN'T SAID ANTHEA EARNESTLY IT WAS THE BIRD THE MAN SAID
THERE IS A SOCIETY CALLED THAT SAID CYRIL WHERE IS IT AND WHAT IS A SOCIETY ASKED THE BIRD IT'S A SORT OF JOINED TOGETHER LOT OF PEOPLE A SORT OF BROTHERHOOD A KIND OF WELL
UPSIDE DOWN ON HIS YOUNG HEAD IT WAS THE WORK OF A GOOD MANY MINUTES AND SEVERAL PERSONS TO GET THE JAM OFF HIM AGAIN AND THIS INTERESTING WORK TOOK PEOPLE'S MINDS OFF THE CARPET
THEY WERE VERY NICE TABLEAUX THESE AND I WISH I COULD TELL YOU ABOUT THEM BUT ONE CANNOT TELL EVERYTHING IN A STORY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT THE TABLEAU OF THE PRINCES IN THE TOWER
AND NOT UNJUSTLY CALLED IT LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A BUNDLE OF HAY WHEN THE SOUND OF FATHER'S LATCHKEY IN THE FRONT DOOR SENT EVERY ONE BOUNDING UP THE STAIRS ARE YOU ALL SAFE CRIED MOTHER'S VOICE ARE YOU ALL SAFE
MOTHER AND FATHER OH HOW AWFUL THEY'LL THINK WE'RE BURNED TO CINDERS OH LET'S GO THIS MINUTE AND TELL THEM WE AREN'T WE SHOULD ONLY MISS THEM SAID THE SENSIBLE CYRIL WELL YOU GO THEN SAID ANTHEA OR I WILL
IT WAS VERY HOT THE THEATRE WAS A PIT OF FIRE
THE BEGINNING OF THE END WELL I MUST SAY MOTHER SAID LOOKING AT THE WISHING CARPET AS IT LAY ALL DARNED AND MENDED AND BACKED WITH SHINY AMERICAN CLOTH ON THE FLOOR OF THE NURSERY
AND FATHER AND I WILL TAKE YOU AND FETCH YOU GIVE ME THE LAMB DEAR AND YOU AND JANE PUT CLEAN LACE IN YOUR RED EVENING FROCKS AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU FOUND THEY WANTED IRONING
WELL THEN THEY MUST KEEP THEIR BIRD VERY QUIET DISTURBING EVERY ONE LIKE THIS HE SAID IT WON'T DO IT AGAIN SAID ROBERT GLANCING IMPLORINGLY AT THE GOLDEN BIRD I'M SURE IT WON'T
SHE HELD IT OUT AND THE CHILDREN HOLDING IT BY ITS YIELDING CORNERS READ BOX FOR KIDDIES AT GARRICK STALLS FOR US HAYMARKET MEET CHARING CROSS
THIS ISN'T LIKE A COMMON CARPET IT'S VERY MAGIC INDEED DON'T YOU THINK IF WE PUT TATCHO ON IT AND THEN GAVE IT A REST THE MAGIC PART OF IT MIGHT GROW LIKE HAIR IS SUPPOSED TO DO IT MIGHT SAID ROBERT
THEY WERE VERY VERY EARLY WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT UP FULLY THE PHOENIX BALANCING ITSELF ON THE GILDED BACK OF A CHAIR SWAYED IN ECSTASY HOW FAIR A SCENE IS THIS IT MURMURED
HAD SET FIRE TO THE PARAFFIN WITH WHICH THAT MORNING THE CHILDREN HAD ANOINTED THE CARPET IT BURNED MERRILY THE CHILDREN TRIED IN VAIN TO STAMP IT OUT THEY HAD TO STAND BACK AND LET IT BURN ITSELF OUT
LIKE SCHOOL PRIZES ARE SAID TO BE BUT IT SEEMED A LITTLE ABSENT MINDED AND EVEN A LITTLE SAD
THAT WAS WHY THE PAPERS SAID NEXT DAY THAT THE FIRE AT THE THEATRE HAD DONE LESS DAMAGE THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED
ONLY THE FABRIC OF THE OLD CARPET WAS LEFT AND THAT WAS FULL OF HOLES COME SAID THE PHOENIX I'M COOL NOW THE FOUR CHILDREN GOT ON TO WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE CARPET
AND HE MADE THEM PLAY ALL THE OLD EXHAUSTING GAMES WHIRLING WORLDS WHERE YOU SWING THE BABY ROUND AND ROUND BY HIS HANDS AND LEG AND WING WHERE YOU SWING HIM FROM SIDE TO SIDE BY ONE ANKLE AND ONE WRIST
AND SO SAT SWELTERING THROUGH WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN A MOST THRILLING MEAL HE FELT THAT HE WAS A BLOT ON THE SMART BEAUTY OF THE FAMILY AND HE HOPED THE PHOENIX KNEW WHAT HE WAS SUFFERING FOR ITS SAKE
IRONING THE DRESSES AND SEWING THE LACE IN OCCUPIED SOME TIME AND NO ONE WAS DULL BECAUSE THERE WAS THE THEATRE TO LOOK FORWARD TO AND ALSO THE POSSIBLE GROWTH OF HAIRS ON THE CARPET
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT I HAD POWER OVER FIRE DO NOT DISTRESS YOURSELF I LIKE MY HIGH PRIESTS IN LOMBARD STREET CAN UNDO THE WORK OF FLAMES KINDLY OPEN THE CASEMENT IT FLEW OUT
IT WAS CYRIL WHO FETCHED THE TATCHO BOTTLE FROM FATHER'S WASHHAND STAND BUT THE BOTTLE HAD NOT MUCH IN IT WE MUSTN'T TAKE IT ALL JANE SAID IN CASE FATHER'S HAIR BEGAN TO COME OFF SUDDENLY
YOU HAVE MY LEAVE TO DEPART SAID THE PHOENIX GENTLY WELL HE IS A BEAUTY AND NO MISTAKE SAID THE ATTENDANT ONLY I'D COVER HIM UP DURING THE ACTS IT UPSETS THE PERFORMANCE AND HE WENT
JANE HAD TO SIT ON ANTHEA'S LAP HOME SAID CYRIL AND INSTANTLY THE COOL DRAUGHT FROM UNDER THE NURSERY DOOR PLAYED UPON THEIR LEGS AS THEY SAT THEY WERE ALL ON THE CARPET STILL
AND ROLL HIM THERE WHICH IS THE DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII ALL THE SAME I WISH WE COULD DECIDE WHAT WE'D BETTER SAY NEXT TIME MOTHER SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT THE CARPET SAID CYRIL BREATHLESSLY CEASING TO BE A BURNING MOUNTAIN
I HAVE HEARD THAT THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING FIERY THEY ONLY DRINK A GREAT DEAL MUCH MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DRINK LEMONADE AND FIZZY THINGS AND THE MORE YOU DRINK OF THOSE THE MORE GOOD YOU GET
LET'S GET OUT FATHER SAID STAY HERE SAID ANTHEA VERY PALE AND TRYING TO SPEAK IN HER ORDINARY VOICE
AND THE CARPET WAS LYING IN ITS PROPER PLACE ON THE NURSERY FLOOR AS CALM AND UNMOVED AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN TO THE THEATRE OR TAKEN PART IN A FIRE IN ITS LIFE
SO A SMALL TEASPOONFUL OF THE TATCHO WAS PUT ON THE EDGES OF THE WORST DARN IN THE CARPET AND RUBBED CAREFULLY INTO THE ROOTS OF THE HAIRS OF IT AND ALL THE PARTS
NO DEAR WE CAN'T HELP OUR BOOTS SAID MOTHER CHEERFULLY BUT WE MIGHT CHANGE THEM WHEN WE COME IN PERHAPS IT'S JUST AN IDEA OF MINE I WOULDN'T DREAM OF SCOLDING ON THE VERY FIRST MORNING AFTER I'VE COME HOME OH MY LAMB HOW COULD YOU
IT WAS TRUE AND YOU'RE SAFE MOTHER BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN AND FATHER SAID BED WAS A GOOD PLACE AFTER THE PLEASURES OF THE STAGE SO EVERY ONE WENT THERE
I'VE READ ABOUT FIRES IN PAPERS I'M SURE IT'S ALL RIGHT LET'S WAIT HERE AS FATHER SAID WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE SAID ANTHEA BITTERLY LOOK HERE SAID ROBERT I'M NOT FRIGHTENED NO I'M NOT
WITH A GLOOMY SHAKE OF THE HEAD BUT I AM GETTING OLD WHY YOU'VE HARDLY BEEN HATCHED ANY TIME AT ALL TIME REMARKED THE PHOENIX IS MEASURED BY HEARTBEATS I'M SURE THE PALPITATIONS I'VE HAD SINCE I'VE KNOWN YOU
AND GILDED WOODWORK IT SEEMED TO HAVE MADE BUT ONE CIRCULAR WING SWEEP SUCH AS YOU MAY SEE A GULL MAKE OVER GREY WATER ON A STORMY DAY NEXT MOMENT IT WAS PERCHED AGAIN ON THE CHAIR BACK
AND ANTHEA MOTHER LOOKED AT THEM QUICKLY AND SAID WELL OF COURSE I SEE YOU'VE MENDED IT VERY NICELY AND THAT WAS SWEET OF YOU DEARS THE BOYS HELPED TOO SAID THE DEARS HONOURABLY BUT STILL
IT CAUGHT WHERE IT WAS PARAFFINY SAID ANTHEA I MUST GET RID OF THAT CARPET AT ONCE SAID MOTHER BUT WHAT THE CHILDREN SAID IN SAD WHISPERS TO EACH OTHER AS THEY PONDERED OVER LAST NIGHT'S EVENTS WAS
BUT I SHOULD THINK PARAFFIN WOULD DO AS WELL AT ANY RATE AS FAR AS THE SMELL GOES AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE GREAT THING ABOUT TATCHO BUT WITH ALL ITS FAULTS ANTHEA'S IDEA WAS SOMETHING TO DO AND THEY DID IT
AFTER THE CLASS THE PINK CHECKED GIRL WHOSE NAME MOST APPROPRIATELY WAS DEBORAH STALKED WILLIAM FOR SEVERAL YARDS AND FINALLY CORNERED HIM WILLIAM SHE SAID ARE YOU GOING TO TURN I'M GOIN TO THINK ABOUT IT SAID WILLIAM GUARDEDLY WILLIAM
THE CAT COVERED WITH GREEN PAINT AFTER ALL IT WAS HIS LAST DAY HE SAW HIMSELF FROM TO MORROW ONWARD LEADING A QUIET AND BLAMELESS LIFE WALKING SEDATELY TO SCHOOL WORKING AT HIGH PRESSURE IN SCHOOL DOING HIS HOMEWORK CONSCIENTIOUSLY IN THE EVENING
CARELESSLY HE FLICKED THE MULE WITH THE WHIP THERE ARE SEVERAL EXPLANATIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED THEN THE MULE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN USED TO THE WHIP A WASP MAY HAVE JUST STUNG HIM AT THAT PARTICULAR MINUTE A WANDERING DEMON MAY HAVE ENTERED INTO HIM
MULES ARE NOTORIOUSLY ACCESSIBLE TO WANDERING DEMONS WHATEVER THE EXPLANATION THE MULE SUDDENLY STARTED FORWARD AND GALLOPED AT FULL SPEED DOWN THE HILL THE REINS DROPPED FROM WILLIAM'S HANDS
THE FAT WOMAN AND THE DONKEY MAN JOINED THE PURSUIT TO WILLIAM IT WAS LIKE SOME GHASTLY NIGHTMARE AFTER AN EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT AT THE CINEMATOGRAPH MEANWHILE THE DONKEY AND THE MULE FRATERNISED OVER THE DEBRIS
OR HAD GOT ON TO IT BY MISTAKE OR OR ANYTHING CONSCIENCE STIRRED FAINTLY IN HIS BREAST BUT HE SILENCED IT STERNLY CONSCIENCE WAS TO RULE HIM FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AND IT COULD JOLLY WELL LET HIM ALONE THIS DAY
TWO YOUNG MEN AND A MAIDEN WERE THE RECIPIENTS OF HER HOSPITALITY DAD WILL BE HERE IN A MINUTE SHE SAID HE'S JUST GONE TO THE DARK ROOM TO SEE TO SOME PHOTOS HE'D LEFT IN TONING OR FIXING OR SOMETHING
HE CLUNG FOR DEAR LIFE ON TO HIS SEAT AS THE CARAVAN SWAYING AND JOLTING ALONG THE UNEVEN ROAD SEEMED TO BE DOING ITS UTMOST TO FLING HIM OFF THERE CAME A RATTLE OF CROCKERY FROM WITHIN THEN SUDDENLY THERE CAME ANOTHER SOUND FROM WITHIN A
SO THAT IT WAS PRESUMABLY EMPTY TOO
HE THOUGHT SUDDENLY OF THE NOBLE BURGLAR WHO HAD TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE MYSTERIOUS NEFARIOUS TOOLS OF HIS TRADE
MEETING HER SERIOUS EYE HE LOOKED AWAY HASTILY AND WE MUST ALL HELP SOMEONE WENT ON THE URGENT VOICE IF WE HAVE TURNED OURSELVES WE MUST HELP SOMEONE ELSE TO TURN
AND PLACED IN ITS STEAD A WORM WHICH HAD JUST APPEARED IN THE WINDOW BOX IN READINESS FOR THE EARLY BIRD HE SURVEYED THE SCENE WITH A DEEP SIGH OF SATISFACTION
WILLIAM'S SPIRITS ROSE HIS HUNGER WAS FORGOTTEN COME ON HE SAID WE MIGHT FIND SOMEONE TO RESCUE HERE IT LOOKS LIKE A PLACE WHERE THERE MIGHT BE SOMEONE TO RESCUE THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE GARDEN TO QUESTION THE RIGHT OF ENTRY OF TWO SMALL BOYS ARMED WITH A BUGLE AND A TOY PISTOL
IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE HOWEVER THERE WERE VARIOUS QUITE IMPORTANT THINGS TO BE DONE THERE WAS A WHOLE NORMAL LIFETIME OF CRIME TO BE CROWDED INTO ONE DAY
AND HOW LONG WILL YOU KEEP ME IN THIS VILE PRISON SHE WAS SAYING IN A VOICE THAT TREMBLED WITH ANGER BASE WRETCH THAT YOU ARE CRUMBS EJACULATED WILLIAM HA HA SNEERED THE MAN I HAVE YOU IN MY POWER
THE YOUNG LADY VISITOR EMITTED A SCREAM THAT WOULD HAVE DONE CREDIT TO A FACTORY SIREN THEN AT THE OPEN FRENCH WINDOW APPEARED A SMALL BOY HOLDING A BUGLE PURPLE FACED WITH THE EFFORT OF HIS PERFORMANCE ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER SPEECH
WHOLE FIELDS OF CRIME ENTIRELY UNEXPLORED ALL THESE THINGS AND OTHERS MUST BE DONE BEFORE THE REFORMATION
A KNIGHT WAS A PERSON WHO SPENT HIS TIME GOING ROUND SUCCOURING THE OPPRESSED SUCKIN WOT SAID WILLIAM BEWILDERED SUCCOUR MEANS TO HELP HE SPENT HIS TIME HELPING ANYONE WHO WAS IN TROUBLE HOW MUCH DID HE GET FOR IT ASKED WILLIAM
HE COULD SEE THE GARDENER SMILING IN THE DISTANCE THERE WAS A SMALL BLUE BRUISE ON HIS SHINING HEAD WILLIAM JUDGED FROM THE SMILE THAT HE HAD LAID HIS FORMAL COMPLAINT BEFORE AUTHORITY WILLIAM NOTICED THAT HIS FATHER LOOKED PALE AND HARASSED
WILLIAM POSSESSED A TRUE STRATEGIC INSTINCT FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT FOR A RETREAT HEARING THEREFORE A HEAVY STEP ON THE STAIRS HE SEIZED SEVERAL PIECES OF TOAST AND FLED
BUT THEY KNEW THAT NO SABBATH PEACE OR CALM WAS HUMANLY POSSIBLE WHILE WILLIAM WAS IN THE HOUSE
AND HE HAD PUT OFF THIS ONE IDLY IN FAVOUR OF SOMETHING MORE PRESSING NOW THERE WAS ONLY ONE DAY HE TOOK UP HIS PEA SHOOTER AND AIMED CAREFULLY THE PEA DID NOT EMBED ITSELF DEEPLY INTO THE GARDENER'S SKULL AS WILLIAM HAD SOMETIMES THOUGHT IT WOULD
NO YOU WON'T SAID GINGER SIMPLY I'LL REMIND YOU ALL RIGHT WELL LET'S SET OFF COURSE SAID WILLIAM IT WOULD BE NICER WITH ARMOUR AN HORSES AN TRUMPETS BUT I SPECT FOLKS UD THINK
THE IDEA OF THE THING BEGAN TO TAKE HOLD OF WILLIAM'S IMAGINATION I SAY HE SAID TO HIS CHUM GINGER AFTER SCHOOL THAT KNIGHT THING SOUNDS ALL RIGHT SUCKIN' I MEAN HELPIN PEOPLE AN FIGHTIN AN ALL THAT
MIGHT BE THERE THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE TACTLESS ENOUGH TO QUESTION HIM AS HE PASSED THE DOOR THEN HE JOINED THE MAIN ROAD THE MAIN ROAD WAS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR A CARAVAN A CARAVAN GAILY PAINTED IN RED AND YELLOW IT HAD LITTLE LACE CURTAINS AT THE WINDOW
HE NOTICED ALSO WITH A THRILL OF HORROR THAT HIS HAND WAS BOUND UP AND THAT THERE WAS A LONG SCRATCH DOWN HIS CHEEK HE KNEW THE CAT HAD SCRATCHED SOMEBODY BUT CRUMBS A SMALL BOY CAME DOWN THE ROAD AND SAW WILLIAM HESITATING AT THE OPEN GATEWAY
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TURN I'LL HELP YOU SHE ADDED SWEETLY WILLIAM DREW A DEEP BREATH ALL RIGHT I WILL HE SAID SHE HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF
NO I'M NOT SQUIRE I BET SQUIRES DID THE MILKIN KNIGHTS WU'N'T OF DONE THE MILKIN I'LL REMEMBER SAID GINGER BITTERLY WHEN YOU'RE SQUIRE ALL THE THINGS WOT YOU SAID A SQUIRE OUGHT TO DO WHEN I WAS SQUIRE
WHO HAS THIS TO IT DONE HE JOINED THE FRENZIED ALTERCATION THAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN THE DONKEY MAN AND THE FAT WOMAN THE AIR WAS RENT BY THEIR ANGRY SHOUTS A GROUP OF HIGHLY APPRECIATIVE VILLAGERS COLLECTED ROUND THEM
I'LL GIVE YOU FIRST DRINK OUT OF A BOTTLE OF GINGER ALE WOT I'M GOIN TO GET WITH MY NEXT MONEY IT'LL BE THREE WEEKS OFF CAUSE THEY'RE TAKIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS TO PAY FOR AN OLE WINDOW WOT MY BALL SLIPPED INTO BY MISTAKE
GAZED PENSIVELY FROM HIS BEDROOM WINDOW HE WAS REVIEWING HIS DAY HE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE STORMY AND DECIDEDLY UNPLEASANT SCENE WITH HIS FATHER MISTER BROWN'S RHETORIC HAD BEEN RATHER LOST ON WILLIAM
IT WAS ALTOGETHER A MOST FASCINATING CARAVAN NO ONE SEEMED TO BE NEAR IT WILLIAM LOOKED THROUGH THE WINDOWS THERE WAS A KIND OF DRESSER WITH CROCKERY HANGING FROM IT A SMALL TABLE AND A LITTLE OIL STOVE
WITH SOME DIFFICULTY HE CLIMBED ON TO THE DRIVER'S SEAT TOOK THE REINS SAID GEE UP TO THE MELANCHOLY MULE AND THE WHOLE EQUIPAGE WITH A JOLT AND FAINT RATTLE
AND THE VILLAGERS HELPED THEMSELVES TO ALL THEY COULD FIND BUT THE FAT MAN WAS VERY FAT AND THE FAT WOMAN WAS VERY FAT AND THE DONKEY MAN WAS VERY OLD AND WILLIAM WAS YOUNG AND VERY FLEET SO IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES THEY GAVE UP THE PURSUIT AND RETURNED PANTING AND QUARRELLING TO THE ROAD
WE'D GOT NOTHIN TO PUT IT IN SO WE'D ONLY OF GOT TOSSED FOR NOTHIN P'RAPS IF WE'D GONE ON
HIS FACE PURPLE WITH EXCITEMENT WE'VE FOUND SOMEONE TO RESCUE ALL RIGHT HE'S A BASE WRETCH WOT SHE SAID ALL RIGHT WILL YOU KILL HIM SAID THE AWED SQUIRE
WELL SAID WILLIAM AFTER A PAUSE LET'S BE SQUIRES IN TURN YOU FIRST HE ADDED HASTILY WOT'LL YOU GIVE ME IF I'M FIRST SAID GINGER DISPLAYING AGAIN THE BASE COMMERCIALISM OF HIS AGE WILLIAM CONSIDERED
SO HE PURCHASED A BUN AND A BOTTLE OF LEMONADE AT A NEIGHBOURING SHOP AND SAT BY THE ROADSIDE TO RECOVER THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF HIS PURSUERS HE FELT RELUCTANT TO RETURN HOME IT IS ALWAYS WELL TO FOLLOW A MORNING'S ABSENCE FROM SCHOOL BY AN AFTERNOON'S ABSENCE FROM SCHOOL
WILLIAM CONSIDERED THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS THAT HE HAD WANTED TO DO FOR SOME TIME BUT HADN'T MANAGED TO DO YET HE HAD NOT TRIED TURNING OFF THE WATER AT THE MAIN AND HIDING THE KEY AND SEEING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HE HADN'T TRIED SHUTTING UP THE CAT IN THE HEN HOUSE
OPPOSITE HIM SAT A SMALL GIRL IN A PINK AND WHITE CHECKED FROCK HE OFTEN WHILED AWAY THE DULLEST HOURS OF SUNDAY SCHOOL BY PUTTING OUT HIS TONGUE AT HER OR THROWING PAPER PELLETS AT HER MANUFACTURED PREVIOUSLY FOR THE PURPOSE BUT TO DAY
WE MUST ALL START AFRESH SHE SAID WE MUST ALL BE TURNED THAT'S WHAT CONVERSION MEANS WILLIAM'S FASCINATED EYE WANDERED FROM THE CHERRIES TO THE DISTANT VIEW OUT OF THE WINDOW
I'LL GO HE STOPPED A NIGHTMARE SOUND AS DISCORDANT AS IT WAS EAR SPLITTING FILLED THE ROOM MISS GREENE SANK BACK INTO HER CHAIR SUDDENLY WHITE ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN LET A CUP OF TEA FALL NEATLY FROM HIS FINGERS ON TO THE FLOOR AND THERE CRASH INTO FRAGMENTS
HE STEPPED AWAY FROM THE BROKEN CROCKERY ON THE FLOOR AS IF TO DISCLAIM ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT AND SAID STERNLY DID YOU MAKE THAT HORRIBLE NOISE MISS GREENE BEGAN TO LAUGH HYSTERICALLY DO HAVE SOME TEA NOW YOU'VE COME SHE SAID TO GINGER
YOU BASE WRETCH LIKE WOT SHE SAID YOU WAS BAWLED WILLIAM HIS MOUTH STILL APPLIED CLOSELY TO THE KEYHOLE LET ME OUT AT ONCE OR I'LL YOU MEAN OLE OPPRESSOR WHO THE DEUCE ARE YOU WHAT'S THIS TOMFOOL TRICK
NOTHING OF COURSE SAID MISS DREW APPALLED BY THE BASE COMMERCIALISM OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HE HELPED THE POOR BECAUSE HE LOVED THEM WILLIAM HE HAD A LOT OF ADVENTURES AND FIGHTING AND HE HELPED BEAUTIFUL PERSECUTED DAMSELS
WHILE HE WAS SPLUTTERING WILLIAM WHO HAD JUST DISCOVERED THAT HIS BIRD HAD FLOWN APPEARED AT THE WINDOW
ROARING FURY AND THREATS OF VENGEANCE HURLED HIMSELF INTO THE ROOM MISS PRISCILLA'S FATHER HAD MADE HIS ESCAPE BY A SMALL WINDOW AT THE OTHER END OF THE SHED
YOU MIGHT GO AN MILK THAT SUGGESTED WILLIAM MILK UD BE BETTER'N NOTHING
I WILL KEEP YOU HERE A PRISONER TILL YOU SIGN THE PAPER WHICH WILL MAKE ME MASTER OF ALL YOUR WEALTH AND BEWARE GIRL IF YOU DO NOT SIGN YOU MAY ANSWER FOR IT WITH YOUR LIFE GOLLY MURMURED WILLIAM THEN HE CRAWLED AWAY INTO THE BUSHES FOLLOWED BY HIS ATTENDANT SQUIRE WELL SAID WILLIAM
THE WHIP POISED LIGHTLY IN THE OTHER WAS IN THE SEVENTH HEAVEN OF BLISS HE WAS DRIVING A CARAVAN HE WAS DRIVING A CARAVAN HE WAS DRIVING A CARAVAN
AND TURNED UPON HER FIERCELY SHE SCREAMED AT HIM FURIOUSLY IN REPLY THEN ALONG THE ROAD COULD BE SEEN THE FIGURE OF A FAT MAN CARRYING A FISHING ROD HE BEGAN TO RUN WILDLY TOWARDS THE CARAVAN ACH GOTT IN HIMMEL HE CRIED AS HE RAN MY BEAUTIFUL CARAVAN
UNCHALLENGED THEY WENT UP TO THE HOUSE WHILE THE KNIGHT WAS WONDERING WHETHER TO BLOW HIS BUGLE AT THE FRONT DOOR OR BY THE OPEN WINDOW
IF I'D BROUGHT ANY I'D HAVE BROUGHT IT FOR ME MORE'N FOR YOU WILLIAM FINGERED HIS MINUTE PISTOL IF WE MEET ANY WILD ANIMALS HE SAID DARKLY
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT A JOLLY LONG TIME FOR THAT DRINK OF GINGER ALE AN EXPRESSION OF DEJECTION CAME OVER GINGER'S FACE AN YOU WASN'T EVEN EVER SQUIRE HE SAID THEN HE BRIGHTENED
THE GARDENER HAD A PERFECTLY BALD HEAD WILLIAM HAD SOMETIMES IDLY IMAGINED THE IMPACT OF A PEA SENT VIOLENTLY FROM A PEA SHOOTER WITH THE GARDENER'S BALD HEAD BEFORE THERE HAD BEEN A LIFETIME OF EXPERIMENT BEFORE HIM
AND HE WAS DRIVING A RED AND YELLOW CARAVAN ALONG THE HIGH ROAD THE BIRDS SEEMED TO BE SINGING A PAEON OF PRAISE TO HIM HE WAS INTOXICATED WITH PRIDE IT WAS HIS CARAVAN HIS ROAD HIS WORLD
WILLIAM AROSE WITH A DISTINCT SENSE THAT SOMETHING IMPORTANT HAD HAPPENED THEN HE THOUGHT OF THE REFORMATION HE SAW HIMSELF LEADING A QUIET AND BLAMELESS LIFE
WILLIAM'S RESPECT FOR THE KNIGHT ROSE OF COURSE SAID MISS DREW HASTILY THEY NEEDN'T NECESSARILY BE BEAUTIFUL BUT IN MOST OF THE STORIES WE HAVE THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL FOLLOWED SOME STORIES OF FIGHTING AND ADVENTURE AND THE RESCUING OF BEAUTIFUL DAMSELS
DETERMINED AND EAGER WAS THE EYE THAT THE SMALL GIRL TURNED UPON WILLIAM AND WILLIAM REALISED THAT HIS TIME HAD COME HE WAS TO BE CONVERTED HE FELT ALMOST THRILLED BY THE PROSPECT
WILLIAM'S HAIR STOOD ON END HE ALMOST FORGOT TO CLING TO THE SEAT FOR NOT ONE SCREAM CAME BUT MANY
SHE TURNED HER EYES UPON THEM SADLY GO ON SAID THE KNIGHT TO HIS RELUCTANT SQUIRE
SO THAT HE MET HIS OLD CRONIES OF THE WEEK DAYS HENRY GINGER DOUGLAS AND ALL THE REST AND TOGETHER THEY BEGUILED THE MONOTONY OF THE SABBATH BUT THIS SUNDAY THE TALL PALE LADY WHO FOR HER SINS
TO MORROW IT WOULD ALL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MORROW BEGAN THE BLAMELESS LIFE IT MUST ALL BE WORKED OFF TO DAY HE SKIRTED THE SCHOOL BY A FIELD PATH IN CASE ANY OF THOSE NARROW SOULS PAID TO EMPLOY SO AIMLESSLY THE PRECIOUS HOURS OF HIS YOUTH
OFF THE TWO SET UPON THE ROAD OF ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE I'LL CARRY THE BUGLE SAID GINGER CAUSE I'M SQUIRE WILLIAM WAS LOTH TO GIVE UP HIS TREASURE WELL I'LL CARRY IT NOW HE SAID BUT WHEN I BEGIN FIGHTIN FOLKS I'LL GIVE IT YOU TO HOLD
YES SAID GINGER SLOWLY
WE OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL AFTER DINNER YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BROUGHT SUMTHIN SAID WILLIAM SEVERELY YOU'RE THE SQUIRE YOU'RE NOT MUCH OF A SQUIRE NOT TO HAVE BROUGHT SUMTHIN FOR ME TO EAT AN ME PUT IN GINGER
AN EXCITING CHASE BY AN ANGRY FARMER IT WAS AFTER TEA TIME WHEN HE RETURNED HOME WALKING WITH CARELESS BRAVADO AS OF A CRIMINAL WHO HAS DRUNK OF CRIME TO ITS VERY DEPTH AND FLAUNTS IT BEFORE THE WORLD HIS SPIRITS SANK A LITTLE AS HE APPROACHED THE GATE
ESSAYED TO LEAD WILLIAM AND HIS FRIENDS ALONG THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW PATH OF VIRTUE WAS ALMOST INSPIRED SHE WAS LIKE SOME PROPHETESS OF OLD SHE WAS SO EMPHATIC THAT THE RED CHERRIES THAT HUNG COQUETTISHLY OVER THE EDGE OF HER HAT RATTLED AGAINST IT AS THOUGH IN APPLAUSE
YOU'LL CATCH IT HE SAID CHEERFULLY THEY'VE WROTE TO SAY YOU WASN'T IN SCHOOL WILLIAM CREPT ROUND TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE BENEATH THE BUSHES HE FELT THAT THE TIME HAD COME TO GIVE HIMSELF UP TO JUSTICE BUT HE WANTED AS THE POPULAR SAYING IS TO BE SURE OF GETTING HIS MONEY'S WORTH
HE HADN'T TRIED PAINTING HIS LONG SUFFERING MONGREL JUMBLE WITH THE POT OF GREEN PAINT THAT WAS IN THE TOOL SHED HE HADN'T TRIED POURING WATER INTO THE RECEIVER OF THE TELEPHONE HE HADN'T TRIED LOCKING THE COOK INTO THE LARDER THERE WERE IN SHORT
A RESOUNDING KICK SHOOK THE DOOR I'VE GOTTER PISTOL SAID WILLIAM STERNLY I'LL SHOOT YOU DEAD IF YOU KICK THE DOOR DOWN YOU MANGY OLE BEAST THE SOUND OF KICKING CEASED AND A SCRAMBLING AND SCRAPING ACCOMPANIED BY OATHS PROCEEDED FROM THE INTERIOR
THEN ONE OF THEM POINTED TO WILLIAM WHO SAT FEELING STILL SLIGHTLY SHAKEN UPON THE BANK IT WAS IM WOT DONE IT HE SAID IT WAS IM THAT WAS A DRIVIN OF IT DOWN THE ILL
THE GARDENER RETIRED GRUMBLING TO THE POTTING SHED SO FOR THE PRESENT
THEY WALKED ALONG FOR ABOUT A MILE WITHOUT MEETING ANYONE WILLIAM BEGAN TO BE AWARE OF A SINKING FEELING IN THE REGION OF HIS WAIST I WONDER WOT THEY EAT HE SAID AT LAST I'M GETTIN SO'S I WOULDN'T MIND SUMTHIN TO EAT
BECAUSE ITS PEARLS OF SARCASM HAD BEEN SO FAR ABOVE HIS HEAD AND WILLIAM HAD NOT BEEN REALLY LOTH TO RETIRE AT ONCE TO BED AFTER ALL IT HAD BEEN A VERY TIRING DAY NOW HIS THOUGHTS WERE GOING OVER SOME OF ITS MOST EXQUISITE MOMENTS
E GOT IT QUITE SUDDEN LIKE AN E GIVE UP ALL IS BAD WAYS STRAIGHT OFF
THE VERY TELEGRAPH POSTS SEEMED TO GAPE WITH ENVY AND ADMIRATION AS HE PASSED WHAT ULTIMATELY HE WAS GOING TO DO WITH HIS CARAVAN HE NEITHER KNEW NOR CARED ALL THAT MATTERED WAS IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNNY MORNING AND ALL THE OTHERS WERE IN SCHOOL
WILLIAM AND GINGER SAT ON THE RAILING THAT SEPARATED THEIR HOUSES IT'S NOT REALLY MUCH FUN BEIN A KNIGHT SAID WILLIAM SLOWLY NO AGREED GINGER
HURLED HIMSELF AT THE DOOR AND TURNED THE KEY IN THE LOCK HERE CAME AN ANGRY SHOUT FROM INSIDE WHO'S THAT WHAT THE DEVIL
THE MOMENTS WHEN THE PEA AND THE GARDENER'S HEAD MET AND REBOUNDED WITH SUCH SATISFACTORY FORCE THE MOMENT WHEN HE SWUNG ALONG THE HIGH ROAD MONARCH OF A CARAVAN AND A MULE AND THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD THE MOMENT WHEN THE SCARECROW HUNCHED UP AND COLLAPSED SO REALISTICALLY
HE MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE ASYLUM HE LOOKS MAD HE HAD A VERY MAD LOOK I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS STANDING AT THE WINDOW HE'S EVIDENTLY HUNGRY ANYWAY I CAN'T THINK WHY FATHER DOESN'T COME HERE GINGER FORTIFIED BY A WALNUT BUN REMEMBERED HIS MISSION
HAVE ANOTHER CAKE DARLING BOY SHE SAID IN A TONE OF HONEYED SWEETNESS NOTHING LOTH GINGER SELECTED AN ORNATE PYRAMID OF ICING AT THIS POINT THERE CAME A BELLOWING AND CRASHING AND TRAMPING OUTSIDE AND MISS PRISCILLA'S FATHER
A RETURN IN THE AFTERNOON IS IGNOMINIOUS AND HUMILIATING WILLIAM WANDERED ROUND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD EXPERIENCING ALL THE THRILL OF THE OUTLAW CERTAINLY BY THIS TIME THE GARDENER WOULD HAVE COMPLAINED TO HIS FATHER PROBABLY THE SCHOOLMISTRESS WOULD HAVE SENT A NOTE ALSO
THE KITTEN A MASS OF FURY AND LUST FOR REVENGE CAME FLYING THROUGH THE WINDOW WILLIAM HID BEHIND A LAUREL BUSH TILL IT HAD PASSED THEN SET OFF DOWN THE ROAD SCHOOL OF COURSE WAS IMPOSSIBLE
AND SENT HIM PAINED AND PROTESTING DOWN THE ROAD EVERY SUNDAY AFTERNOON THEIR ONLY REGRET WAS THAT SUNDAY SCHOOL DID NOT BEGIN EARLIER AND END LATER FORTUNATELY FOR WILLIAM MOST OF HIS FRIENDS PARENTS WERE INSPIRED BY THE SAME ZEAL
GINGER REMEMBERED THE PANGS OF HUNGER OF WHICH EXCITEMENT HAD MOMENTARILY RENDERED HIM OBLIVIOUS AND DECIDING THAT THERE WAS NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT TOOK A CAKE FROM THE STAND AND BEGAN TO CONSUME IT IN SILENCE YOU'D BETTER BE CAREFUL SAID THE YOUNG LADY TO HER HOSTESS
WILLIAM DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DRIVE BUT IT DID NOT SEEM TO MATTER THE MULE AMBLED ALONG AND WILLIAM HIGH UP ON THE DRIVER'S SEAT THE REINS HELD WITH OSTENTATIOUS CARELESSNESS IN ONE HAND
HE COULD SEE THROUGH THE TREES THE FAT CARAVAN OWNER GESTICULATING AT THE DOOR HELPED BY THE VILLAGERS HE HAD TRACKED WILLIAM PHRASES FLOATED TO HIM THROUGH THE SUMMER AIR MINE BEAUTIFUL CARAVAN ACH GOTT IN HIMMEL
THERE WAS THE TIN HALF FULL OF GREEN PAINT IN THE TOOL SHED HE'D HAD HIS EYE ON IT FOR SOME TIME HE WENT QUIETLY ROUND TO THE TOOL SHED SOON HE WAS CONTEMPLATING WITH A SATISFIED SMILE A GREEN AND ENRAGED CAT
WILLIAM SAT ON THE FURTHER OUTSKIRTS OF THE WOOD AND PANTED HE FELT ON THE WHOLE EXHILARATED BY THE ADVENTURE IT WAS QUITE A SUITABLE ADVENTURE FOR HIS LAST DAY OF UNREGENERATION BUT HE FELT ALSO IN NEED OF BODILY SUSTENANCE
WILLIAM TOOK HIS BUGLE PROUDLY IN ONE HAND AND HIS PISTOL THE GLORIOUS RESULT OF A DIP IN THE BRAN TUB AT A SCHOOL PARTY IN THE OTHER
SHAKING HER FIST AT THE WORLD IN GENERAL HER HAIR AND FACE WERE COVERED WITH SUGAR AND A FORK WAS EMBEDDED IN THE FRONT OF HER DRESS OTHERWISE SHE TOO HAD ESCAPED UNDAMAGED THE OWNER OF THE DONKEY CART AROSE FROM THE MELEE OF POTS AND PANS
BEING EXQUISITELY POLITE TO HIS FAMILY HIS INSTRUCTORS AND THE VARIOUS FOOLISH PEOPLE WHO VISITED HIS HOME FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE APPARENTLY OF MAKING INANE REMARKS TO HIM HE SAW ALL THIS AND THE PICTURE WAS FAR FROM UNATTRACTIVE IN THE DISTANCE
IT APPEARED TO BE A MULE A MULE WITH A JAUNDICED VIEW OF LIFE IT ROLLED A SAD EYE TOWARDS WILLIAM THEN WITH A DEEP SIGH RETURNED TO ITS CONTEMPLATION OF THE LANDSCAPE WILLIAM GAZED UPON CARAVAN AND STEED FASCINATED
AND SHE WAS SPEAKING FAST AND PASSIONATELY WILLIAM READY FOR ALL CONTINGENCIES MARSHALLED HIS FORCES FOLLOW ME HE WHISPERED AND CREPT ON ALL FOURS NEARER THE WINDOW THEY COULD SEE A MAN NOW AN ELDERLY MAN WITH WHITE HAIR AND A WHITE BEARD
AND A GREEN AND ENRAGED HEN THEN BRACING HIMSELF FOR THE EFFORT HE DELIVERED HIMSELF UP TO JUSTICE WHEN ALL WAS SAID AND DONE NO PUNISHMENT COULD BE REALLY ADEQUATE TO A DAY LIKE THAT DUSK WAS FALLING WILLIAM
PERHAPS I'D BETTER GO AND FIND HIM OH LET ME GO MISS GREENE SAID ONE OF THE YOUTHS ARDENTLY WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'D FIND THE PLACE IT'S A SHED IN THE GARDEN THAT HE USES
HE WAS SO ENTHRALLED THAT HE RECEIVED ABSENT MINDEDLY AND WITHOUT GRATITUDE THE MOUNTAINOUS BULL'S EYE PASSED TO HIM FROM GINGER AND ONLY GAVE A HALF HEARTED SMILE WHEN A WELL AIMED PELLET FROM HENRY'S HAND SENT ONE OF THE PROPHETESS'S CHERRIES SWINGING HIGH IN THE AIR
IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW HE SAID YOU CAN GO HOME HE'S SHUT UP ME AN WILLIAM SHUT HIM UP YOU SEE SAID THE YOUNG LADY WITH A MEANING GLANCE AROUND I SAID HE WAS FROM THE ASYLUM HE LOOKED MAD WE'D BETTER HUMOUR HIM AND RING UP THE ASYLUM
TO WILLIAM THE IDEA OF REFORM WAS NEW AND STARTLING AND NOT WHOLLY UNATTRACTIVE IT ORIGINATED WITH THE HOUSEMAID WHOSE BROTHER WAS A REFORMED BURGLAR NOW EMPLOYED IN A GROCER'S SHOP
IT BOUNCED BACK IT BOUNCED BACK QUITE HARD THE GARDENER ALSO BOUNCED BACK WITH A YELL OF ANGER SHAKING HIS FIST AT WILLIAM'S WINDOW BUT WILLIAM HAD DISCREETLY RETIRED HE HID THE PEA SHOOTER ASSUMED HIS FAMOUS EXPRESSION OF INNOCENCE AND FELT DISTINCTLY CHEERED
NEVER IN HIS FUTURE LIFE OF NOBLE MERIT WOULD HE BE ABLE TO ANNEX A CARAVAN
WILLIAM WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED THE POINT WAS ALL INNOCENTLY DRIVEN IN LATER BY THE SUNDAY SCHOOL MISTRESS WILLIAM'S FAMILY HAD NO REAL FAITH IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL AS A CORRECTIVE TO WILLIAM'S INHERENT WICKEDNESS
SAID WILLIAM SAY DAY AFTER TO MORROW SHE CONSIDERED THIS FOR A MINUTE VERY WELL SHE SAID AT LAST RELUCTANTLY DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE NEXT DAY DAWNED BRIGHT AND FAIR
OR LOCKING THE COOK INTO THE LARDER OR OR HUNDREDS OF THINGS THERE CAME A GENTLE VOICE FROM THE GARDEN WILLIAM WHERE ARE YOU WILLIAM LOOKED DOWN AND MET THE EARNEST GAZE OF DEBORAH HELLO HE SAID WILLIAM SHE SAID YOU WON'T FORGET THAT YOU'RE GOING TO START TO MORROW WILL YOU
HE SPOKE WITH THE BITTERNESS THAT ALWAYS CHARACTERISED HIS STATEMENTS OF THE INJUSTICE OF THE GROWN UP WORLD ALL RIGHT SAID GINGER I WON'T FORGET ABOUT THE DRINK OF GINGER ALE
BEING EXQUISITELY POLITE TO HIS FAMILY AND INSTRUCTORS AND THE VISION FAILED UTTERLY TO ATTRACT
ANYWAY SHE SAID WE COULD STILL BE KNIGHTS AN HELP PEOPLE DI'N'T SHE ANYWAY I'LL GET MY BUGLE THAT'LL BE SOMETHING WILLIAM'S BUGLE HAD JUST RETURNED TO PUBLIC LIFE AFTER ONE OF ITS PERIODIC TERMS OF RETIREMENT INTO HIS FATHER'S KEEPING

A WHOLE SUIT OF SAILS WAS COMPLETELY WORN OUT ON THIS VOYAGE BUT WHAT CAN ONE EXPECT WHEN THE SHIP IS BEING WORKED EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH CLEWING UP MAKING FAST AND SETTING OF SAILS BOTH IN CALMS AND WINDS
AS A MATTER OF FACT WHO WAS HE NOT THAT IT COULD ACTUALLY BE SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS A FORGER OF NOTES STILL LESS A BRIGAND SEEING THAT HIS EXTERIOR WAS RESPECTABLE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE YET WHO WAS HE
ON THE EVENING OF JULY TWENTY NINTH SAINT HELENA WAS PASSED IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN THIS HISTORIC ISLAND IT WAS VERY STRANGE TO THINK THAT THE GREATEST SPIRIT OF A HUNDRED CENTURIES AS SOME AUTHOR HAS CALLED NAPOLEON
I SHOULD NEVER HAD THOUGHT HIM CAPABLE OF SUCH THINGS I ALWAYS GUESSED HIM TO BE SO THE TWO LADIES WERE STILL DISCUSSING THE MATTER WITH ACUMEN
AND NO THREE AT FIVE HUNDRED METRES
A TERRIBLE THOUGHT CONSIDERING THAT HE THE PRESIDENT
IN PROPORTION AS THE SENSATION SPREAD TO MORE REMOTE CORNERS OF THE TOWN AT LENGTH WITH THESE PERFECTINGS
UNTIL I THOUGHT HE MUST THINK ME MAD
ON OUR FIRST HYDROGRAPHIC CRUISE IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC I SUPPOSE THERE WAS NO ONE ON BOARD ON JUNE EIGHTH NINETEEN TEN WHO DREAMED THAT A YEAR LATER WE SHOULD GO ON A SIMILAR CRUISE IN THE SOUTH
YET LITTLE WAS GLEANED FROM THAT SOURCE MERELY A STATEMENT THAT HE HAD BOUGHT OF HER SOME SOULS FOR FIFTEEN ROUBLES APIECE AND ALSO A QUANTITY OF FEATHERS WHILE PROMISING ALSO TO BUY SOME OTHER COMMODITIES IN THE FUTURE
WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND WENT OUT IN THE MOST LOVELY WEATHER THAT CAN BE IMAGINED GRADUALLY THE LAND DISAPPEARED AND IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING WE LOST THE LIGHTS WE WERE ONCE MORE OUT IN THE ATLANTIC
THAT SUCH THINGS SHOULD HAPPEN TRY AND IMAGINE MY FEELINGS IN MY OPINION THERE IS IN THIS MORE THAN THE DEAD SOULS WHICH MEET THE EYE I THINK SO TOO AGREED THE OTHER AS A MATTER OF FACT HER FRIEND'S REMARK HAD STRUCK HER WITH COMPLETE SURPRISE
LISTEN TO WHAT FATHER CYRIL'S WIFE HAD TO TELL ME SHE SAID THAT
I AM ALTOGETHER AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO
AS THE WATER IS TAKEN FROM THE RELEASE TAKES PLACE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
WHAT A PRETTY CHINTZ SHE CRIED GAZING AT THE OTHER'S GOWN YES IT IS PRETTY AGREED THE VISITOR
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED IT WELL TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I GUESSED IT AS SOON AS EVER YOU OPENED YOUR MOUTH SO MUCH THEN FOR EDUCATING GIRLS LIKE THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER AT SCHOOL JUST SEE WHAT COMES OF IT
BUT HE REPLIED NO NO THEY ARE NOT DEAD TIS I WHO TELL YOU THAT
THE UPPER APPARATUS I IS THEN AT THREE HUNDRED METRES
SEEING THAT IN PARTICULAR HE HAD ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE TREASURY FOR LARD A FACT CONSTITUTING FAIRLY PRESUMPTIVE PROOF THAT THE MAN WAS A ROGUE SEEING THAT JUST SUCH ANOTHER FELLOW
IN NINETEEN TEN THIS ISLAND WAS PASSED ON OCTOBER SIXTEENTH WE CHECKED OUR CHRONOMETERS WHICH HOWEVER PROVED TO BE CORRECT FROM NOON TILL TWO P M WHILE WE WERE LYING STILL AND
A NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL AN EVENT WHICH OF COURSE HAD THROWN THE WHOLE ARMY OF PROVINCIAL TCHINOVNIKS INTO A STATE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT SEEING THAT THEY KNEW THAT BEFORE LONG THERE WOULD ENSUE TRANSFERMENTS AND SENTENCES OF CENSURE
AND NORTH WESTERLY WINDS TO THE COAST OF AFRICA AND THERE GET HOLD OF THE SOUTH EAST TRADE IF WE COULD NOT REACH AFRICA BEFORE THAT DATE THEN TO TURN ON JULY TWENTY SECOND AND LAY OUR COURSE
THIS WORK EVERY DAY REMINDED ME OF THE CORVETTE ELLIDA WHEN THE ORDER WAS ALL HANDS ALOFT AS A RULE THOUGH IT WAS ONLY CLEWING UP THE SAILS THAT HAD TO BE DONE AS WE ALWAYS HAD TO TAKE SOUNDINGS ON THE WEATHER SIDE
AND IMMEDIATELY EVERYTHING RESUMED ITS OLD COURSE IN ORDER TO SAVE OUR SUPPLY OF PRESERVED PROVISIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE TOOK WITH US A QUANTITY OF LIVE POULTRY AND NO FEWER THAN TWENTY LIVE SHEEP
SHOUTED TO THE COACHMAN RIGHT AWAY THE REASON OF ALL THIS WAS THAT THE LADY WAS THE POSSESSOR OF A PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE
THIS TIME WAS NOT AT OUR DISPOSAL
AND SAMPLES OF WATER AT GREATER DEPTHS THAN ONE THOUSAND METRES
I SWEAR THAT THEY ARE STILL ALIVE IN SHORT HE MADE SUCH A SCENE THAT THE WHOLE VILLAGE CAME RUNNING TO THE HOUSE AND CHILDREN SCREAMED AND MEN SHOUTED
IN ORDER THAT AT LEAST IT MIGHT BE LEARNT
THOUGH NOT PARTICULARLY SAVOURY IS NOT INFREQUENTLY EMPLOYED NAMELY THE EXPEDIENT OF GETTING LACQUEYS QUIETLY TO APPROACH THE SERVANTS OF THE PERSON CONCERNING WHOM INFORMATION IS DESIRED
OR FRESHLY PAINTED EVERYTHING HUNG IN ITS PLACE AND SUCH ORDER AND CLEANLINESS REIGNED THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO GO DOWN THERE THE RESULT OF ALL THIS RENOVATING AND SMARTENING UP WAS THAT WHEN WE FETCHED UP BY THE QUAY AT BUENOS AIRES
AND TEMPERATURES OCCUPIED EIGHT HOURS FROM SEVEN A M TILL THREE P M
ONE REASON WHY THE MEN'S PARTY WAS SO CERTAIN THAT THE DEAD SOULS CONNOTED SOMETHING CONTRARY TO GOOD ORDER AND DISCIPLINE WAS THAT THERE HAD JUST BEEN APPOINTED
WHICH PAUL IVANOVITCH POSSESSED FINALLY HE DELIVERED ON CHICHIKOV WITH ACUTELY KNITTED BROWS A EULOGY COUCHED IN THE MOST CHARMING OF TERMS AND COUPLED WITH SUNDRY SENTIMENTS ON THE SUBJECT OF FRIENDSHIP AND AFFECTION IN GENERAL
IN BRIEF THEY DISPLAYED EVERYWHERE THE MALE BENT THE RUDE
FOR THEY KNOCKED ON THE HEAD ALL PREVIOUS CONCEPTIONS AND THEORIES NOT FOR A MOMENT COULD IT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE FORMER DOCUMENT REFERRED TO CHICHIKOV YET AS EACH MAN PONDERED THE POSITION FROM HIS OWN POINT OF VIEW
WE FIRST TRIED TAKING SOUNDINGS WITH A SINKER OF SIXTY SIX POUNDS AND A TUBE FOR TAKING SPECIMENS OF THE SEA BED
WE DID NOT BEGIN AT ONCE TO TAKE SAMPLES OF WATER AND WITH A HEAD WIND NORTH EAST WE LAY CLOSE HAULED FOR SOME DAYS WE ALSO HAD A PRETTY STIFF BREEZE
BOTH DECK HOUSES THE BOATS AND THE VARIOUS WINCHES
WILL SHOW WHETHER THE MATERIAL COLLECTED IS OF ANY VALUE AND WHETHER THE CRUISE HAS YIELDED SATISFACTORY RESULTS AS REGARDS THE WEATHER ON THE TRIP IT WAS UNIFORMLY GOOD THE WHOLE TIME
NOT AT HOME FOR HER PART THE GUEST WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE PROCEEDED TO BUSINESS BY COMMUNICATING HER TIDINGS BUT A SUDDEN EXCLAMATION FROM THE HOSTESS IMPARTED TEMPORARILY A NEW DIRECTION TO THE CONVERSATION
AND CARRYING ON WITH HER AN ARDENT LIAISON AND THAT THEREAFTER HE HAD MADE AN APPLICATION FOR THE DESIRED HAND BUT THAT THE MOTHER FEARING TO COMMIT A SIN AGAINST RELIGION AND FEELING IN HER HEART CERTAIN GNAWINGS OF CONSCIENCE
OR OF JUMPING TO A CONCLUSION
BRAVO FRAM IT WAS WELL DONE ESPECIALLY AFTER THE BAD CHARACTER YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN AS A SAILER AND A SEA BOAT
AND ENGINE POWER THE NUMBER OF STATIONS WAS SIXTY IN ALL AND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE SAMPLES OF WATER WERE TAKEN OF PLANKTON SPECIMENS ONE HUNDRED NINETY WERE SENT HOME THE FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THESE SPECIMENS IN NORWAY
AND TO ASCERTAIN FROM THEM THE SERVANTS CERTAIN DETAILS WITH REGARD TO THEIR MASTER'S LIFE AND ANTECEDENTS YET EVEN FROM THIS SOURCE
I HAD THOUGHT OF TAKING SAMPLES OF WATER AT FOUR THOUSAND THREE THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND METRES
I CONFESS THAT THE WORDS PASS MY UNDERSTANDING CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE HEARD SPEAK OF THOSE SOULS TRUE MY HUSBAND AVERS THAT NOZDREV WAS LYING YET IN HIS LIES THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A GRAIN OF TRUTH WELL
DID THE VISITOR LET FALL A REMARK WHICH LED HER ENTERTAINER TO INQUIRE AND HOW IS THE UNIVERSAL CHARMER
AND THE VISITOR'S BREATHING BECAME MORE HURRIED AND FURTHER WORDS SEEMED TO BE HOVERING BETWEEN HER LIPS LIKE HAWKS PREPARING TO STOOP UPON THEIR PREY ONLY A PERSON OF THE UNHUMANITY OF A TRUE FRIEND WOULD HAVE HAD THE HEART TO INTERRUPT HER
SHOULD HAVE ENDING HIS RESTLESS LIFE ON THIS LONELY ISLAND OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC ON AUGUST TWELFTH WHEN DAYLIGHT CAME WE SIGHTED THE LITTLE MARTIN VAZ ISLANDS AHEAD AND A LITTLE LATER SOUTH TRINIDAD
EVERY MOMENT SHE KEPT LOOKING OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AND PERCEIVING WITH ALMOST SPEECHLESS VEXATION THAT AS YET SHE WAS BUT HALF WAY ON HER JOURNEY
IN PARTICULAR DID THE DIRECTOR OF THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT TURN PALE AT THE THOUGHT THAT POSSIBLY THE NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL WOULD SURMISE THE TERM DEAD FOLK TO CONNOTE PATIENTS IN THE LOCAL HOSPITALS WHO FOR WANT OF PROPER PREVENTATIVE MEASURES
AT THE REQUIRED DEPTH REMAINS IN IT WHILE IT IS BEING HEAVED UP AND IS COLLECTED IN BOTTLES WHEN THE APPARATUS IS RELEASED THE COLUMN OF MERCURY IN THE THERMOMETER IS BROKEN
CERTAINLY I SHOULD SAY SO WHY I HAVE KNOWN HIM EVEN TRY TO SELL HIS OWN FATHER AT ALL EVENTS HE STAKED HIM AT CARDS
ONE MAY HEARTILY COMMEND THE TASTE OF OUR LADIES FOR HAVING FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM NEVERTHELESS IT IS NOT AS YOU SUPPOSE THINK NOW
TRUE THESE REMARKS SUFFICED TO INDICATE THE TENDER IMPULSES OF THE SPEAKER'S HEART BUT ALSO THEY DID NOTHING TO ENLIGHTEN HIS EXAMINERS CONCERNING THE BUSINESS THAT WAS ACTUALLY AT HAND AS FOR SOBAKEVITCH
THEY ARE LEFT HANGING FOR A FEW MINUTES SO THAT THE THERMOMETERS MAY BE SET AT THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE BEFORE THE COLUMN OF MERCURY IS BROKEN
THIS GAVE THE TCHINOVNIKS FURTHER FOOD FOR THOUGHT PERHAPS HIS LIFE REALLY DID STAND IN DANGER PERHAPS
AS WELL AS THE SERIES OF OFFICIAL DINNERS
SEEING THAT CHICHIKOV WAS AS RICH AS A JEW BUT
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN AND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE FATHOMS
WE MADE TWO FAIRLY PARALLEL SECTIONS WITH COMPARATIVELY REGULAR INTERVALS BETWEEN THE STATIONS AS REGULAR IN ANY CASE AS ONE CAN HOPE TO GET WITH A VESSEL LIKE THE FRAM WHICH REALLY HAS TOO LITTLE BOTH OF SAIL AREA
THE DECKS THEMSELVES WERE SMEARED WITH A MIXTURE OF OIL TAR AND TURPENTINE AFTER BEING SCOURED ALL THE RIGGING WAS EXAMINED
LYING CLOSE HAULED TO THE SOUTH
THOUGH INNOCENT HAD TO ENDURE ABOUT AS UNPLEASANT A TETE A TETE AS EVER BEFELL A MAIDEN OF SIXTEEN WHILE FOR HIS PART THE SWISS FOOTMAN RECEIVED ORDERS NEVER AT ANY TIME
THE AFFAIR SEEMED TO ME SO HORRIBLE SO UTTERLY HORRIBLE THAT I TREMBLED BEYOND BELIEF
WHEN I HEARD SOME ONE ARRIVING I WONDERED WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE CALLING SO EARLY PARASHA DECLARED THAT IT MUST BE THE VICE GOVERNOR'S WIFE SO AS I DID NOT WANT TO BE BORED WITH HER I GAVE ORDERS THAT I WAS TO BE REPORTED
ONE MORNING THE KEENEST OF OUR FISHERMEN CAME UP AS USUAL AND FELT THE LINE YES BY JOVE AT LAST THERE WAS ONE AND A BIG ONE TOO AS HE COULD HARDLY HAUL IN THE LINE BY HIMSELF
SHE WAS HIGHLY OFFENDED WHEN SHE HEARD THE STORIES AND VERY JUSTLY SO
FORTY ONE FIFTY FOUR EIGHTY ONE ONE HUNDRED EIGHT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE FOUR HUNDRED TEN AND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SIX FATHOMS IN ALL
AND THAT INSTANCES OF WHOLE VILLAGES PERISHING THROUGH THE SAME COULD BE FOUND ON RECORD FINALLY OUR FRIENDS THE TCHINOVNIKS FOUND THEMSELVES COMPELLED TO RESORT TO AN EXPEDIENT WHICH
ARE WHAT ARE WHAT INQUIRED THE GUEST IN GREAT EXCITEMENT ARE ARE TELL ME TELL ME FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
THERE WAS A SHOUT FOR ASSISTANCE HI YOU BEGGAR COME AND LEND A HAND THERE'S A BIG FISH HELP CAME IN A SECOND
AND ALL THE PROVISIONS RE STOWED
WITH REGARD TO MANILOV HE REPLIED THAT HE WOULD ANSWER FOR CHICHIKOV AS HE WOULD FOR HIMSELF
WE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF WIND NOW AND THEN WITH SEAS AND ROLLING BUT FOR THE MOST PART THERE WAS A FRESH BREEZE IN THE SOUTH EAST TRADE WE SAILED FOR FOUR WEEKS AT A STRETCH WITHOUT USING THE ENGINE
WHICH WE COULD REACH BEFORE AUGUST FIRST FROM THERE AGAIN WITH THE SAME WIND TO SOUTH TRINIDAD AUGUST ELEVENTH OR TWELVE ON AGAIN WITH EASTERLY AND NORTH EASTERLY WINDS
HOW THE WORTHY DAMES CAME TO KNOW THAT HE WAS MARRIED REMAINS A MYSTERY AND THE SAID DESERTED WIFE
WE HAD TO LIE AT ANCHOR HERE FOR A DAY AND A HALF AS THE PILOT COULD NOT BE TAKEN OFF ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON THE TENTH HE WAS FETCHED OFF BY A BIG TUG BOAT
AND WHAT EXACTLY UNDERLAY THEM AND WHETHER IN PASSING HE HAD EXPLAINED TO ANY ONE HIS REAL INTENTIONS OR REVEALED TO ANY ONE HIS IDENTITY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THEREFORE RESORT WAS HAD TO KOROBOTCHKA
APPARATUS TWO IS THEN PUT ON AND IT IS LOWERED AGAIN FOR ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED METRES WHEN APPARATUS I IS PUT ON AND THE LINE PAID OUT FOR THREE HUNDRED METRES ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR FATHOMS THAT IS
HAVING DONE THEIR BUSINESS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE THE LADIES PARTY DESCENDED UPON THE MALE SECTION WITH A VIEW TO INFLUENCING IT TO THEIR OWN SIDE BY ASSERTING THAT THE DEAD SOULS
AND IN PARTICULAR HAD DONE THE ARCHPRIEST OUT OF OVER A HUNDRED ROUBLES THUS THE NET RESULT OF MADAME'S CROSS EXAMINATION WAS TO CONVINCE THE TCHINOVNIKS THAT SHE WAS A GARRULOUS SILLY OLD WOMAN
GO QUICKER ANDRUSHA YOU ARE A HORRIBLY LONG TIME OVER THE JOURNEY THIS MORNING BUT AT LENGTH THE GOAL WAS REACHED AND THE KOLIASKA STOPPED BEFORE A ONE STORIED WOODEN MANSION DARK GREY IN COLOUR AND
AND MUST THEREFORE BE SOUGHT FOR WITH THE UTMOST DILIGENCE WHILE THE SECOND DOCUMENT WAS A LETTER FROM THE GOVERNOR OF A NEIGHBOURING PROVINCE WITH REGARD TO A MALEFACTOR WHO HAD THERE EVADED APPREHENSION A LETTER CONVEYING ALSO A WARNING THAT
NATURALLY AS THE MOTHER OF A FAMILY AND AS THE FIRST LADY IN THE TOWN
IN SPITE OF ALL THIS DELIGHTFUL AIR THREE OR FOUR OF THE CREW WERE DOWN WITH INFLUENZA AND HAD TO KEEP THEIR BERTHS FOR SOME DAYS
AND IRREFUTABLY MATERIALISED THEY STOOD STRIPPED OF ALL DOUBT AND OTHER IMPEDIMENTA SAID SOME OF THE LADIES IN QUESTION CHICHIKOV HAD LONG BEEN IN LOVE WITH THE MAIDEN
ALSO HOWEVER MUCH THEY MIGHT ARM THEMSELVES AND TAKE THE FIELD THE MEN COULD NOT COMPASS SUCH ORDERLINESS WITHIN THEIR RANKS AS COULD THE WOMEN WITH THE FORMER EVERYTHING WAS OF THE ANTIQUATED
PROVIDED HIS INTERROGATORS MERELY WITH A TASTE OF THE SMELL OF HIS LIVING ROOM AND SELIFAN CONFINED HIS REPLIES
OR RATHER THEY PRICKED THEMSELVES UP AND STRAIGHTENED HERSELF AND BECAME SOMEHOW MORE MODISH AND DESPITE HER NOT INCONSIDERABLE WEIGHT POSED HERSELF TO LOOK LIKE A PIECE OF THISTLEDOWN FLOATING ON THE BREEZE THE DEAD SOULS BEGAN THE HOSTESS
I WONDER HOW ANY ONE CAN SEE ANYTHING IN THE MAN TO PRAISE OR TO ADMIRE
IF IN THE PROVINCE OF THE TOWN OF N THERE SHOULD APPEAR ANY SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUAL WHO COULD PRODUCE NEITHER REFERENCES NOR PASSPORTS HE WAS TO BE ARRESTED FORTHWITH THESE TWO DOCUMENTS LEFT EVERY ONE THUNDERSTRUCK
AND EVERLASTING TIMIDITY FOR INSTANCE THE MEN'S PARTY DECLARED THAT THE WHOLE STORY WAS RUBBISH THAT THE ALLEGED ABDUCTION OF THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER
TAKING OUR DAILY HYDROGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS A SAILING SHIP APPEARED
PROBABLY BECAUSE THE FUNCTION IN LIFE OF ITS MEMBERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN THAT OF MANAGING AND ADMINISTERING A HOUSEHOLD WITH THE LADIES THEREFORE MATTERS SOON ASSUMED VIVID AND DEFINITE SHAPE THEY BECAME CLEARLY
PETRIFIED GENUINE AMAZEMENT MY GOD SHE CRIED
WHEN THE SINKERS STRIKE AGAINST THE CYLINDERS BUT I USED TO LOOK AT MY WATCH
BUT THAT AS A MAN OF SUBTLETY AND EXPERIENCE HE HAD BETHOUGHT HIM OF OBTAINING THE DAUGHTER'S HAND
THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES APPEARED TO HER LONGER THAN USUAL AND IN PARTICULAR DID THE FRONT OF THE WHITE STONE HOSPITAL WITH ITS ROWS OF NARROW WINDOWS SEEM INTERMINABLE
CONSEQUENTLY SHE FELT THE MORE THAT SHE NEEDED TENDER COMFORT AND ADVICE
OF SAILS ROENNE WAS OCCUPIED THE WHOLE TIME
AND SUCCESSFULLY AFFECTING THE ABDUCTION AND INDEED MORE THAN ONE MAN WAS CONVERTED AND JOINED THE FEMININE CAMP IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THEREBY SUCH SECEDERS INCURRED STRONG NAMES FROM THEIR LATE COMRADES
WHEN THIS SINKER STRIKES THE FIRST APPARATUS A SPRING IS PRESSED
NEARLY THE WHOLE SHIP WAS PAINTED AGAIN MASTS AND YARDS
AND A PARROT THAT KEPT ALTERNATELY DANCING ON THE FLOOR OF ITS CAGE AND HANGING ON TO THE RING OF THE SAME WITH ITS BEAK ALSO IN THE SUNSHINE BEFORE THE DOOR TWO PET DOGS WERE SLEEPING HERE
JUST THINK AFTER THIS HOW ANY ONE CAN SAY THAT THE MAN IS CHARMING I CANNOT IMAGINE
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TRIP WE TOOK TEMPERATURES AND SAMPLES OF WATER AT THE FOLLOWING DEPTHS
AS ALREADY MENTIONED CLOSE THE ENDS OF THE CYLINDER WHICH IS FIXED IN ITS NEW POSITION BY A HOOK IN THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME AT THE SAME INSTANT
BUT IT HUNG FOR A WHOLE MONTH WITHOUT THERE BEING A SIGN OF A FISH
THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY AND ONE THOUSAND METRES
AND HAD HIMSELF ACTED AS PLUSHKIN'S REPRESENTATIVE WHAT IF THESE THINGS SHOULD REACH THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S EARS HE MENTIONED THE MATTER TO ONE FRIEND AND ANOTHER AND THEY IN THEIR TURN
TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE ONE THOUSAND AND NINETY THREE FATHOMS AND SO ON AND WATER CYLINDERS WERE PUT ON FROM ZERO TO TWO THOUSAND METRES
ALAS THOUGHT THE ARMY OF TCHINOVNIKS IT IS PROBABLE THAT SHOULD HE LEARN OF THE GROSS REPORTS AT PRESENT AFLOAT IN OUR TOWN HE WILL MAKE SUCH A FUSS THAT WE SHALL NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF THEM
TO ABDUCT THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER
BY THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER AND ON GETTING IF POSSIBLE ONE STATION A DAY THE DISTANCE ACCORDING TO A ROUGH CALCULATION WAS ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND NAUTICAL MILES AND I LAID DOWN THE FOLLOWING PLAN
AND THE FRANZ WAS CONGRATULATED BY ALL PRESENT
THAT HE IS A PERFECT RASCAL
AND THOSE WERE PRETTY FAR OFF
HE HAD VANISHED IN THE CROWD WHO STOOD OPEN MOUTHED GAZING AFTER THE DEAD MAN OUR SPEED ON THIS CRUISE WAS REGULATED AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE
OH I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE THINK HIM HANDSOME CONTINUED THE HOSTESS UNMOVED
AND ALSO HAD SERVED IN THE CUSTOMS IN SHORT THE SUM TOTAL OF THE RESULTS GATHERED BY THE TCHINOVNIKS WAS THAT THEY STILL STOOD IN IGNORANCE OF CHICHIKOV'S IDENTITY BUT THAT HE MUST BE SOME ONE WHEREFORE
THERE LIVED THE LADY'S BOSOM FRIEND AS SOON AS THE BOSOM FRIEND IN QUESTION LEARNT OF THE NEWCOMER'S ARRIVAL SHE RAN DOWN INTO THE HALL AND THE TWO LADIES KISSED AND EMBRACED ONE ANOTHER
JUNE THIRTIETH NINETEEN ELEVEN IS A RED LETTER DAY IN THE FRAM'S HISTORY
INDEED MIGHT IT NOT BE THAT CHICHIKOV WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN AN EMISSARY OF THE SAID GOVERNOR GENERAL SENT TO CONDUCT A SECRET INQUIRY
AND ROUGH HEWN AND ILL FITTING AND UNSUITABLE AND BADLY ADAPTED AND INFERIOR KIND THEIR HEADS WERE FULL OF NOTHING BUT DISCORD AND TRIVIALITY AND CONFUSION AND SLOVENLINESS OF THOUGHT
TWO DOCUMENTS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THE FIRST OF THEM CONTAINED ADVICES THAT ACCORDING TO RECEIVED EVIDENCE AND REPORTS THERE WAS OPERATING IN THE PROVINCE A FORGER OF ROUBLE NOTES WHO HAD BEEN PASSING UNDER VARIOUS ALIASES
AND WE DID NOT LOSE MORE THAN ONE THERMOMETER IN ABOUT NINE HUNDRED SOUNDINGS
IS SHE A YOUNG WOMAN OR GOOD LOOKING OH DEAR NO QUITE AN OLD WOMAN SPLENDID INDEED
FOR TAKING SAMPLES OF WATER A WINCH IS USED WITH A SOUNDING LINE OF LET US SAY FIVE THOUSAND METRES TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR FATHOMS ON WHICH ARE HUNG ONE OR MORE TUBES FOR CATCHING WATER
MY DEAREST MADAM SAID MY MAID MASHKA PRAY LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AND SEE HOW WHITE YOU ARE BUT I HAVE NO TIME FOR THAT I REPLIED AS I MUST BE OFF TO TELL MY FRIEND ANNA GRIGORIEVNA
IT WAS DECIDED TO HOLD A FINAL DEBATE ON THE SUBJECT ON WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE AND WHO CHICHIKOV COULD POSSIBLY BE
WHEN THE OBSERVATIONS WERE TO BE CONCLUDED AND WE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE BUENOS AIRES IN THE SHORTEST TIME THAT WAS THE PLAN THAT WE ATTEMPTED
YES BUT TELL ME WHAT IS IN YOUR MIND UPON THIS THE VISITOR HAD TO CONFESS HERSELF NONPLUSSED FOR THOUGH CAPABLE OF GROWING HYSTERICAL SHE WAS INCAPABLE OF PROPOUNDING ANY RATIONAL THEORY
OH DEAR NO HAD THAT BEEN ALL
AND IS EVEN MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN THE DREADED BLACK DEATH ALSO TO ADD TO THE TCHINOVNIKS TROUBLES
WHICH REST IN BEARINGS ON THE FRAME SO THAT THE CYLINDER CAN BE SWUNG ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN THE CYLINDER WHILE BEING LOWERED IN AN INVERTED POSITION IS OPEN AT BOTH ENDS SO THAT THE WATER CAN PASS THROUGH
HAVING WHITE CARVINGS OVER THE WINDOWS A TALL WOODEN FENCE AND NARROW GARDEN IN FRONT OF THE LATTER AND A FEW MEAGRE TREES LOOMING WHITE WITH AN INCONGRUOUS COATING OF ROAD DUST IN THE WINDOWS OF THE BUILDING WERE ALSO A FEW FLOWER POTS
THE FRAM LOOKED BRIGHTER THAN I SUPPOSE SHE HAS EVER DONE SINCE SHE WAS NEW
WHICH WERE QUARTERED IN THE FARMYARD ON THE PORT SIDE OF THE VESSEL'S FORE DECK SHEEP AND HENS WERE ALL TOGETHER AND THERE WAS ALWAYS A MOST BEAUTIFUL SCENT OF HAY SO THAT WE HAD NOT ONLY SEA AIR BUT COUNTRY AIR
WORKING ON HINGES AND PROVIDED WITH PACKING WHEN THE APPARATUS IS RELEASED THE CYLINDER SWINGS ROUND AND THESE VALVES THEN AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE THE ENDS OF THE CYLINDER
TRULY IT WRINGS ONE'S HEART TO SEE TO WHAT LENGTHS IMMORALITY HAS COME SOME OF THE MEN HAVE QUITE LOST THEIR HEADS ABOUT HER BUT FOR MY PART I THINK HER NOT WORTH NOTICING OF COURSE AND HER MANNERS ARE UNBEARABLE
GOES WITHOUT SAYING THE FISHERMEN INCLUDED AS THEY TOOK IT ALL IN GOOD PART AS A FISHING BOAT THE FRAM IS ON THE WHOLE NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL
THIS HOWEVER TOOK SIX HOURS NEXT DAY ON ACCOUNT OF THE HEAVY SEA ONLY A FEW SAMPLES FROM ZERO TO ONE HUNDRED METRES
THE GUEST'S TONE WAS ALMOST PITEOUS IN ITS APPEAL WHAT IS IT THEN YOU CANNOT IMAGINE MY STATE OF MIND YOU SEE THIS MORNING I RECEIVED A VISIT FROM FATHER CYRIL'S WIFE THE ARCHPRIEST'S WIFE YOU KNOW HER DON'T YOU
WHEREUPON CHICHIKOV HAD DECIDED TO CARRY OUT THE ABDUCTION ALLEGED TO THE FOREGOING OF COURSE THERE BECAME APPENDED VARIOUS ADDITIONAL PROOFS AND ITEMS OF EVIDENCE
WE USED THREE AT ONCE TO SAVE TIME NOW SUPPOSING WATER AND TEMPERATURES ARE TO BE TAKEN AT DEPTHS OF THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED METRES
AND ON THE APPROACHING TRIP TO THE ICE BARRIER WE SHOULD HAVE
WHICH MIGHT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE SEEING THAT ANY DIFFICULTIES WHICH MIGHT ARISE IN THE COURSE OF THE ACTUAL TRANSFERMENT OF SOULS WOULD NOT BE HIS FAULT IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT GOD WAS LORD OF ALL AND THAT FEVERS AND OTHER MORTAL COMPLAINTS
NAMES SUCH AS OLD WOMEN PETTICOATS
WE HAD A PILOT ON BOARD AS FAR AS MONTEVIDEO WHERE WE ARRIVED ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE NINTH BUT ON ACCOUNT OF AN INCREASING WIND PAMPERO
THERE CAME THE MOST DREADFUL KNOCKING IMAGINABLE AND SOME ONE SCREAMED OUT
ARRIVED ALL PALE AND TREMBLING AND TOLD HER OH SUCH THINGS
IN FACT SHE FELT DRIVEN TO INQUIRE WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE TO BE HIDDEN BENEATH IT ALL NO TELL ME
H HALVORSEN A OLSEN F STELLER AND J ANDERSEN AT LAST WE WERE MORE OR LESS READY
HAD DECIDED TO ABDUCT THE GIRL IN OTHER CIRCLES THE MATTER WAS STATED IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT IS TO SAY
TWO AND THREE QUARTERS FIVE AND A HALF THIRTEEN AND A HALF
IS HUNG A SLIPPING SINKER ABOUT EIGHT CENTIMETRES
IT'LL BE GRAND TO GET FRESH FISH FOR DINNER AT LAST THE FISH APPEARED OVER THE RAIL BUT ALAS IT WAS SEEN TO HAVE NO HEAD IT WAS AN ORDINARY STOCKFISH ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF A YARD LONG
ON THE THIRD DAY WE MADE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO GET THE BOTTOM THIS TIME WE GOT SPECIMENS OF THE SEA BED FROM ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRES
OF COURSE MADAME KOROBOTCHKA ANSWERED REASONABLY ENOUGH I CANNOT SELL YOU THOSE SOULS
WHICH AT LENGTH FORCED HER TO EJACULATE OH THE CURSED BUILDING POSITIVELY THERE IS NO END TO IT ALSO
PRASKOVIA THEDOROVNA THINKS THAT IN OTHER WORDS THE LADIES PROCEEDED TO INDULGE IN A CONVERSATION ON THE SUBJECT OF DRESS AND ONLY AFTER THIS HAD LASTED FOR A CONSIDERABLE WHILE
HIS NOSE IS PERFECTLY ODIOUS YES
AT THE SAME TIME WE HAD A GOOD OPPORTUNITY OF SMARTENING UP THE SHIP WHICH SHE NEEDED BADLY ALL THE IRON WAS FREED FROM RUST AND THE WHOLE VESSEL PAINTED BOTH BELOW AND ABOVE DECK
BUT WHAT PUZZLES ME MOST IS HOW A TRAVELLED MAN LIKE CHICHIKOV COULD COME TO LET HIMSELF IN FOR SUCH AN AFFAIR SURELY HE MUST HAVE ACCOMPLICES YES AND I SHOULD SAY THAT ONE OF THOSE ACCOMPLICES IS NOZDREV SURELY NOT
SO THAT SINKER TUBE AND OVER TWO THOUSAND METRES OF LINE CONTINUED THEIR WAY
THE NEWS NOR DID I LOSE A MOMENT IN ORDERING THE KOLIASKA YET WHEN MY COACHMAN ANDRUSHA ASKED ME FOR DIRECTIONS
THAT LANDOWNER REPLIED THAT HE CONSIDERED CHICHIKOV AN EXCELLENT FELLOW AS WELL AS THAT THE SOULS WHOM HE HAD SOLD TO HIS VISITOR HAD BEEN IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD ALIVE BUT THAT HE COULD NOT ANSWER FOR ANYTHING
FROM THE END OF THE LINE WHERE A SMALL WEIGHT A HANGS THEN IT IS LOWERED UNTIL THE INDICATOR WHEEL
IN MAKING AND PATCHING SAILS
THIS GENTLEMAN ASKED US IF WE COULD NOT COME INTO THE HARBOUR AS PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SHIP I PROMISED TO COME IN ON THE WAY BACK IF WE HAD TIME ON SUNDAY MORNING THE ELEVENTH
TO APPARATUS TWO WHERE THE SAME THING HAPPENS IT IS THEN REPEATED WITH APPARATUS THREE WHEN THEY ARE ALL READY THEY ARE HEAVED IN BY HOLDING ONE'S FINGER ON THE LINE ONE CAN FEEL
COMMUNICATED THIS LAST SUPPOSITION TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL WHO THOUGH AT FIRST INCLINED TO EJACULATE RUBBISH SUDDENLY TURNED PALE ON PROPOUNDING TO HIMSELF THE THEORY
SO THAT THE SOUNDING LINE SHOULD NOT FOUL THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL
THE NECESSARY DATA ARE ENTERED IN A BOOK ON THE MORNING OF THE SEVENTEENTH THEN THE SAILS WERE CLEWED UP
FIFTEEN SAMPLES FROM EACH STATION AND FROM THIS TIME FORWARD WE WENT ON REGULARLY WITH ONE STATION EVERY DAY FINALLY WE MANAGED TO HEAVE UP TWO WATER CYLINDERS ON THE SAME LINE BY HAND WITHOUT GREAT DIFFICULTY
SEPTEMBER NINETEEN TEN HAD WE BEEN TROUBLED WITH ANIMALS OR INSECTS OF ANY KIND WHATEVER BUT WHEN WE WERE IN BUENOS AIRES FOR THE FIRST TIME AT LEAST HALF A MILLION FLIES CAME ABOARD TO LOOK AT THE VESSEL I HOPED THEY WOULD GO ASHORE
AS ALSO THAT HIS VAGUE REFERENCES TO HIMSELF HAD YES INCLUDED STATEMENTS THAT HIS CAREER IN THE SERVICE
WHEN THEY ACCUSED CHICHIKOV OF THE DEED THAT A WOMAN WAS LIKE A MONEY BAG WHATSOEVER YOU PUT INTO HER SHE THENCEFORTH RETAINED THAT THE SUBJECT WHICH REALLY DEMANDED ATTENTION WAS THE DEAD SOULS OF WHICH THE DEVIL ONLY KNEW THE MEANING
AT LENGTH THE TCHINOVNIKS DECIDED TO MAKE ENQUIRIES AMONG THOSE OF WHOM
WHEN HE SAID NINEPENCE I GAVE HIM THEIR ADDRESS JABBED OUR CARD IN PAID TENPENCE OR ELEVENPENCE TO COVER THE POSTAGE AND THANKED HEAVEN WITH LESS SINCERITY AND INFINITELY MORE TROUBLE THEY EVENTUALLY THANKED ME THE FROPLINSONS DONT PLAY BRIDGE SAID EGBERT
IVE WRITTEN NEARLY AS MANY SAID EGBERT AND IVE HAD MY USUAL BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE TO GET THROUGH TOO BESIDES I DONT KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT THE FROPLINSONS SENT US A WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR CALENDAR SAID JANETTA
YOU MAY ONLY BE CERTAIN THAT NOTHING UNPLEASANT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TRUST ME FOR THAT YOU WILL SUP AT THE CASINO AND SLEEP IF YOU LIKE WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED DO NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS FOR I CANNOT ANSWER THEM SUCH IS MY DEAR HUSBAND THE WHOLE TRUTH
WHEN SHE SAW ME ENTIRELY METAMORPHOSED INTO A NUN SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TRUST ME WITH A GREAT SECRET BUT THAT SHE ENTERTAINED NO FEAR OF MY DISCRETION LET ME TELL YOU CLEAREST FRIEND SHE SAID TO ME THAT I WAS ON THE POINT OF GOING OUT OF THE CONVENT TO RETURN ONLY TOMORROW MORNING
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU I NEVER MEANT TO MAKE YOU UNHAPPY I AM SURE THAT IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR M M WILL BE CRYING LIKEWISE THE ALARUM STRUCK AND HAVING NO LONGER ANY HOPE OF SEEING M M COME TO JUSTIFY HERSELF I KISSED C C
LAURA PERHAPS NO LAURA IS FAITHFUL DEAREST AND I CANNOT GUESS HOW IT WAS BUT HOW COULD YOU BE PERSUADED TO ASSUME THAT DISGUISE AND TO COME HERE YOU CAN LEAVE THE CONVENT AND YOU HAVE NEVER APPRISED ME OF THAT IMPORTANT CIRCUMSTANCE
IT IS C C DRESSED AS A NUN WHO MORE ASTONISHED EVEN THAN MYSELF DOES NOT UTTER ONE WORD OR MAKE A MOVEMENT I THROW MYSELF IN AN ARM CHAIR IN ORDER TO BREATHE AND TO RECOVER FROM MY SURPRISE THE SIGHT OF C C HAD ANNIHILATED ME
SHE GIVES HIM BACK TO ME WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THEN SHE WISHES ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE DESPISES ALSO MY TENDER AFFECTION FOR HER SINCE SHE PLACES ME IN A POSITION TO SHEW THAT AFFECTION FOR ANOTHER PERSON
I HAVE ONLY THE SAME CONVENTIONAL LANGUAGE OF GRATITUDE AT MY DISPOSAL WITH WHICH TO THANK DEAR OLD COLONEL CHUTTLE FOR HIS PERFECTLY DELICIOUS STILTON WHICH WE SHALL DEVOUR TO THE LAST MORSEL AND THE FROPLINSONS FOR THEIR CALENDAR WHICH WE SHALL NEVER LOOK AT
EVERYBODY LAUGHED LOUDLY AND IMPROVING MY OPPORTUNITY I RAN THROUGH THE CROWD AND DISAPPEARED I WAS IN A PERSPIRATION AND THE WEATHER WAS COLD I THREW MYSELF INTO A GONDOLA AND IN ORDER NOT TO GET CHILLED I LANDED AT THE RIDOTTO
I HAVE HOWEVER JUST DECIDED THAT YOU SHALL GO INSTEAD YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR AND YOU DO NOT REQUIRE ANY INSTRUCTIONS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU WILL MEET WITH NO DIFFICULTY IN AN HOUR A LAY SISTER WILL COME HERE I WILL SPEAK A FEW WORDS APART TO HER
NO FOR I SHOULD CAUSE HER TOO GREAT A SORROW SHE LOVES YOU DEARLY AND CHERISHES THE LOCKET WHICH CONTAINS YOUR LIKENESS
A WORDSWORTH BOOKLET NEXT CHRISTMAS AND ANOTHER CALENDAR THE CHRISTMAS AFTER WITH THE SAME PROBLEM OF HAVING TO WRITE SUITABLE LETTERS OF THANKFULNESS NO THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO DROP ALL FURTHER ALLUSION TO THE CALENDAR AND SWITCH OFF ON TO SOME OTHER TOPIC BUT WHAT OTHER TOPIC
I MEAN ON THE CONTRARY TO DO ALL I CAN TO BRING PEACE BETWEEN YOU TWO AND I MUST SUCCEED BEFORE LONG BECAUSE MY FRIEND IS NOT GUILTY OF ANY WRONG AND YOU ONLY FEEL SOME SPITE ALTHOUGH WITH NO CAUSE
AND SOME CONVENTIONAL HIEROGLYPHIC TO SHOW THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO BE A CHRISTMAS OR NEW YEAR GIFT THERE WOULD BE A COUNTERFOIL WITH SPACE FOR THE RECIPIENTS NAME AND THE DATE OF ARRIVAL AND ALL YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO WOULD BE TO SIGN AND DATE THE COUNTERFOIL ADD A CONVENTIONAL HIEROGLYPHIC
ENTERED THE SANCTUARY AND SAW MY DIVINITY LEANING AGAINST THE MANTELPIECE SHE WORE HER CONVENT DRESS I COME NEAR HER BY STEALTH IN ORDER TO ENJOY HER SURPRISE I LOOK AT HER AND I REMAIN PETRIFIED ASTOUNDED THE PERSON I SEE IS NOT M M
I LAUGHED AND NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING ELSE BUT AN AGREEABLE ADVENTURE I FOLLOWED THE LAY SISTER AND SOON FOUND MYSELF HERE
ENGAGING NEW COOKS AND SO FORTH THESE WILL BE DEALT WITH IN THE USUAL MANNER AS SOMETHING INEVITABLE A LEGITIMATE PART OF OUR DAILY LIFE BUT ALL THE DEVASTATING ACCRETIONS OF CORRESPONDENCE INCIDENT TO THE FESTIVE SEASON
WELL LETS GET ON WITH THE LETTER OF THANKS SAID EGBERT PROCEED SAID JANETTA HOW CLEVER OF YOU TO GUESS THAT WORDSWORTH IS OUR FAVOURITE POET DICTATED EGBERT AGAIN JANETTA LAID DOWN HER PEN DO YOU REALISE WHAT THAT MEANS SHE ASKED
BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE VERY MOMENT I SAW YOU MY HEART KNEW WHO IT WAS BUT A MINUTE AFTER I FELT AS IF THE LIGHTNING HAD STRUCK ME WHEN I SAW YOU STEP BACK FOR I SAW CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT YOU DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND ME
NO SAID JANETTA WITH A NOTE OF TIRED DEFIANCE IN HER VOICE IVE WRITTEN ELEVEN LETTERS TO DAY EXPRESSING SURPRISE AND GRATITUDE FOR SUNDRY UNMERITED GIFTS BUT I HAVENT WRITTEN TO THE FROPLINSONS SOME ONE WILL HAVE TO WRITE TO THEM SAID EGBERT
AFTER ASSURING HER THAT I NO LONGER ENTERTAINED ANY DOUBT OF HER INNOCENCE I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT THE BEHAVIOUR OF HER FRIEND VERY AMBIGUOUS I SAID THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE PLEASURE I FELT IN SEEING HER THE TRICK PLAYED UPON ME BY HER FRIEND WAS A VERY BAD ONE
AND LAUGHING AT ALL THOSE REASONABLE BEINGS WHO EXERCISE THEIR REASON TO AVOID THE MISFORTUNES WHICH THEY FEAR DESTROYING AT THE SAME TIME THE PLEASURE THAT THEY MIGHT ENJOY
AT FIRST I THOUGHT OF GOING AWAY THE MORE SO THAT BOTH C C AND HER FRIEND COULD NOT BE CERTAIN THAT I AND PIERROT WERE THE SAME INDIVIDUAL BUT I SOON ABANDONED THE IDEA WITH HORROR
ARE YOU GOING TO WRITE TO MISSUS LUDBERRY OR THE FROPLINSONS TO NEITHER SAID EGBERT DRAWING A STACK OF NOTEPAPER TOWARDS HIM IM GOING TO WRITE TO THE EDITOR OF EVERY ENLIGHTENED AND INFLUENTIAL NEWSPAPER IN THE KINGDOM IM GOING TO SUGGEST THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SORT OF
AND AS YOU DO NOT OBJECT TO MY BEING YOUR RIVAL AND MAKING HER OFTEN AS HAPPY AS I CAN SHE DOES NOT WANT YOU EITHER TO SUPPOSE THAT HER LOVE IS LIKE HATRED FOR THE LOVE OF A JEALOUS HEART IS VERY MUCH LIKE IT
HEAVENS IVE JUST REMEMBERED MISSUS STEPHEN LUDBERRY I HAVENT THANKED HER FOR WHAT SHE SENT WHAT DID SHE SEND I FORGET I THINK IT WAS A CALENDAR THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE
NOTHING OF THE SORT I HATE FALSEHOODS AND I WILL CERTAINLY NEVER UTTER ONE IN SUCH A CASE AS THIS IT WOULD BE VERY WRONG I DO NOT LOVE YOU LESS ON THAT ACCOUNT MY DARLING ALTHOUGH DURING THIS LONG NIGHT YOU HAVE NOT CONDESCENDED TO GIVE ME THE SLIGHTEST PROOF OF YOUR LOVE
DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH M M AND HAVING COME TO THE CASINO ONLY FOR HER I DID NOT FEEL DISPOSED TO ACCEPT THE EXCHANGE ALTHOUGH I WAS VERY FAR FROM DESPISING C C WHOSE CHARMS WERE AS GREAT AT LEAST AS THOSE OF M M
THE QUADRILLE LASTED ONE HOUR AND I TOOK NO PART IN IT BUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT A HARLEQUIN APPROACHED ME WITH THE IMPERTINENCE WHICH BELONGS TO HIS COSTUME AND FLOGGED ME WITH HIS WAND IT IS HARLEQUIN'S WEAPON
I SEE IN IT ONLY A MARK OF CONTEMPT A GRATUITOUS INSULT MY SELF LOVE TRIED HARD TO IMAGINE SOME REASON LIKELY TO DISPROVE THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT CONTEMPT BUT IN VAIN
I WILL SEND YOU MY LETTER BY LAURA UNLESS YOU PROMISE ME TO GO AND FETCH IT YOURSELF AT HER HOUSE YOUR LETTERS WILL ALWAYS BE DEAR TO ME BUT MARK MY WORDS M M WILL NOT ENTER INTO ANY EXPLANATION SHE WILL BELIEVE YOU IN EVERYTHING EXCEPT IN ONE
NOW DEAREST YOU SPEAK WITHOUT REASON FOR THE RELATIONS BETWEEN YOU TWO ARE OF AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT NATURE YOUR MUTUAL LOVE IS NOTHING BUT TRIFLING NONSENSE MERE ILLUSION OF THE SENSES THE PLEASURES WHICH YOU ENJOY TOGETHER ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE
ITS WHAT I ALWAYS DO SAY AND WHAT EVERY ONE SAYS TO ME PROTESTED EGBERT WE SENT THEM SOMETHING ON THE TWENTY SECOND SAID JANETTA SO THEY SIMPLY HAD TO THINK OF US THERE WAS NO GETTING AWAY FROM IT
BELIEVE ME DEAREST I AM SICK FROM UNHAPPINESS I LOVE YOU WITH MY WHOLE SOUL BUT I AM IN SUCH A SITUATION THAT WHAT YOU ARE WEEPING MY LOVE OH I ENTREAT YOU SPARE MY HEART I AM SO SORRY TO HAVE TOLD YOU SUCH A THING
IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO THINK OF US
ALL HER MOVEMENTS WORE THE STAMP OF THE MOST DECENT RESERVE AND HER CONVERSATION TENDER IN ITS EXPRESSIONS AND PERFECTLY EASY NEVER CONVEYED THE SHADOW OF A REPROACH FOR MY COOLNESS
WELL IT WAS WILLIAM WORDSWORTH THEN SAID JANETTA I KNOW WILLIAM CAME INTO IT SOMEWHERE THAT SOUNDS MORE PROBABLE SAID EGBERT WELL LETS COLLABORATE ON THIS LETTER OF THANKS AND GET IT DONE
I ALMOST FANCIED THAT SHE KNEW IT ALREADY AND I SHARED THE GRIEF WHICH SHE EVIDENTLY WOULD FEEL IN THAT CASE I HAD SEDUCED HER I HAD GIVEN HER THE RIGHT TO CALL ME HER HUSBAND THESE THOUGHTS BROKE MY HEART
THEN SHE OPENED A DRAWER AND MUCH TO MY SURPRISE SHE DRESSED ME IN THIS COSTUME SHE WAS LAUGHING AND I DID THE SAME WITHOUT SUSPECTING THE END OF THE JOKE
AND ANYHOW YOU CANT SUDDENLY DISMISS THE SUBJECT OF THE CALENDAR SURELY THERE MUST BE SOME INTELLIGENT REMARK THAT CAN BE MADE ABOUT IT WELL WE CANT THINK OF ONE SAID JANETTA WEARILY THE FACT IS WEVE BOTH WRITTEN OURSELVES OUT
HAVE NOT FOUND IT POSSIBLE TO RESIST THE CHARMS OF M M I LOVE HER MADLY SHE KNOWS IT AND INTELLIGENT AS SHE IS SHE MUST HAVE MEANT TO SHEW HER CONTEMPT FOR ME BY DOING WHAT SHE HAS DONE I CANDIDLY CONFESS THAT I FEEL HURT IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS OF COURSE SAID EGBERT PEOPLE WHO REALLY TRY TO INFUSE A BREATH OF REALITY INTO THEIR LETTERS OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT AUNT SUSAN FOR INSTANCE WHO WRITES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE HAM
I LOVED HER TENDERLY I ADORED HER BUT AT THAT MOMENT IT WAS NOT HER WHOM I WANTED BECAUSE AT FIRST HER PRESENCE HAD STRUCK ME AS A MYSTIFICATION IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IF I CELEBRATED THE RETURN OF C C IN AN AMOROUS MANNER
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT MY LOVE I FEEL EXTREMELY CURIOUS I AM GLAD OF IT AND I WOULD CONCEAL NOTHING FROM YOU YOU KNOW HOW DEARLY M M AND I LOVE EACH OTHER NO INTIMACY COULD BE MORE TENDER THAN OURS YOU CAN JUDGE OF IT BY WHAT I TOLD YOU IN MY LETTERS
TOWARDS THE END OF OUR LONG CONVERSATION SHE ASKED ME WHAT SHE SHOULD SAY TO HER FRIEND ON HER RETURN TO THE CONVENT MY DEAR M M EXPECTS TO SEE ME FULL OF JOY AND GRATITUDE FOR THE GENEROUS PRESENT SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS MAKING ME BY GIVING ME THIS NIGHT
I WOULD FAIL IN WHAT I OWED TO MYSELF AND I THOUGHT THAT I WAS BOUND IN HONOUR NOT TO LEND MYSELF TO THE IMPOSITION BESIDES WITHOUT EXACTLY REALIZING THAT FEELING I WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE IT IN MY POWER TO REPROACH M M WITH AN INDIFFERENCE VERY STRANGE IN A WOMAN
MOST LIKELY SHE MEANT TO PROVE THAT SHE LOVED YOU FOR YOUR OWN SAKE THAT YOUR HAPPINESS MAKES HER HAPPY AND THAT SHE IS NOT JEALOUS OF HER BEST FRIEND BEING HER RIVAL TO CONVINCE YOU THAT YOU OUGHT NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH HER FOR HAVING DISCOVERED OUR SECRET
OF COURSE I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID EGBERT EVERY PRESENT THAT WAS SENT OFF WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A TICKET BEARING THE DATE OF DISPATCH AND THE SIGNATURE OF THE SENDER
IF SHE LOVED ME AS I LOVE HER SHE NEVER COULD HAVE SENT YOU HERE INSTEAD OF COMING HERSELF I DO NOT THINK SO MY BELOVED FRIEND HER SOUL IS AS NOBLE AS HER HEART IS GENEROUS
THAT IT COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN DISPLEASE ME GREATLY BECAUSE IT WAS AN INSULT TO ME
IN LOVE AND I WANTED TO ACT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SAY THAT SHE HAD PROCURED ME A PLEASURE I MUST ADD THAT I SUSPECTED M M TO BE HIDING IN THE SECRET CLOSET PERHAPS WITH HER FRIEND
WELL TWO DAYS AGO MY DEAR FRIEND BEGGED THE ABBESS AND MY AUNT TO ALLOW ME TO SLEEP IN HER ROOM IN THE PLACE OF THE LAY SISTER WHO HAVING A VERY BAD COLD HAD CARRIED HER COUGH TO THE INFIRMARY
TELL ME NOW WHAT I COULD DO AFTER THAT SPEECH OF MY FRIEND AND AFTER SHE HAD RECEIVED MY PROMISE TO DO WHATEVER SHE WISHED DO NOT DISTRUST WHAT I TELL YOU FOR MY LIPS CANNOT UTTER A FALSEHOOD
BUT TWO O'CLOCK STRUCK AND GAVE ME WARNING THAT LOVE AND COMUS WERE CALLING ME TO BESTOW NEW DELIGHTS UPON ME WITH MY POCKETS FULL OF GOLD AND SILVER I LEFT THE RIDOTTO HURRIED TO MURAN
AND I STOPPED NEAR THE DANCERS AFTER I HAD EXAMINED THE PANTALOONS PUNCHES HARLEQUINS AND MERRY ANDREWS I WENT NEAR THE GRATING WHERE I SAW ALL THE NUNS AND BOARDERS SOME SEATED SOME STANDING AND WITHOUT APPEARING TO NOTICE ANY OF THEM IN PARTICULAR
AND WITH SUCH AN AIR OF STUPIDITY THAT EVERYBODY LAUGHED AND MADE ROOM FOR US MY PARTNER DANCED VERY WELL ACCORDING TO HER COSTUME AND I KEPT MY CHARACTER WITH SUCH PERFECTION THAT THE LAUGHTER WAS GENERAL
BUT I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE SORRY WHEN M M FEELS THE SAME I LOVE HER WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF MARRYING HER DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME DEAREST AS FOR YOU KNOWING THAT YOU MUST BE MY WIFE I AM CERTAIN OF OUR LOVE WHICH PRACTICE WILL ANIMATE WITH NEW LIFE
HE WAS OF MY SIZE BUT AWKWARD AND HE HAD NOTHING BUT STRENGTH I THREW HIM AND SHAKING HIM VIGOROUSLY ON ALL SIDES I CONTRIVED TO DEPRIVE HIM OF HIS HUMP AND FALSE STOMACH THE NUNS WHO HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A MERRY SIGHT CLAPPED THEIR HANDS
BRIDGE MARKERS SAID JANETTA IN A CARDBOARD CASE WITH SOME INANITY ABOUT DIGGING FOR FORTUNE WITH A ROYAL SPADE EMBLAZONED ON THE COVER THE MOMENT I SAW IT IN THE SHOP I SAID TO MYSELF FROPLINSONS AND TO THE ATTENDANT HOW MUCH
YOU PLEAD THE CAUSE OF YOUR FRIEND WITH THE ELOQUENCE OF AN ANGEL BUT DEAR LITTLE WIFE YOU DO NOT SEE THE AFFAIR IN ITS PROPER LIGHT YOU HAVE INTELLIGENCE AND A PURE SOUL BUT YOU HAVE NOT MY EXPERIENCE
TO BECOME JEALOUS OF ONE ANOTHER IT WOULD BE NECESSARY THAT ONE OF YOU TWO SHOULD FEEL A SIMILAR AFFECTION FOR ANOTHER WOMAN BUT M M COULD NO MORE BE ANGRY AT YOUR HAVING A LOVER THAN YOU COULD BE SO YOURSELF IF SHE HAD ONE PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT THE LOVER SHOULD NOT BELONG TO THE OTHER
AND SHE WILL TELL YOU TO FOLLOW HER YOU WILL GO OUT WITH HER THROUGH THE SMALL GATE AND ACROSS THE GARDEN AS FAR AS THE ROOM LEADING OUT TO THE LOW SHORE THERE YOU WILL GET INTO THE GONDOLA AND SAY TO THE GONDOLIER THESE WORDS TO THE CASINO
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UNGRATEFUL I SHOULD EVEN HAVE BEEN CRUEL IF I HAD NOT
BUT IVE COME TO THE END OF MY CAPACITY FOR EXPRESSING SERVILE AMIABILITY ELEVEN LETTERS TO DAY AND NINE YESTERDAY ALL COUCHED IN THE SAME STRAIN OF ECSTATIC THANKFULNESS REALLY YOU CANT EXPECT ME TO SIT DOWN TO ANOTHER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS WRITING ONESELF OUT
YOU WILL REACH IT IN FIVE MINUTES YOU WILL STEP OUT AND ENTER A SMALL APARTMENT WHERE YOU WILL FIND A GOOD FIRE YOU WILL BE ALONE AND YOU WILL WAIT FOR WHOM I ENQUIRED FOR NOBODY YOU NEED NOT KNOW ANY MORE
M M IS AFTER ME THE ONLY WOMAN WORTHY OF YOUR LOVE THE ONLY ONE WITH WHOM I COULD CONSENT TO SHARE IT I USED TO PITY YOU BUT I DO SO NO LONGER AND YOUR HAPPINESS MAKES ME HAPPY KISS ME NOW
MY DEAR M M RETIRED TO HER ROOM AND I FOLLOWED HER THE MOMENT WE WERE ALONE SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WANTED ME TO RENDER HER A SERVICE FROM WHICH DEPENDED OUR HAPPINESS I NEED NOT TELL YOU HOW READILY I ANSWERED THAT SHE HAD ONLY TO NAME IT
THE PERMISSION WAS GRANTED AND YOU CANNOT IMAGINE OUR PLEASURE IN SEEING OURSELVES AT LIBERTY FOR THE FIRST TIME TO SLEEP IN THE SAME BED TO DAY SHORTLY AFTER YOU HAD LEFT THE PARLOUR WHERE YOU SO MUCH AMUSED US WITHOUT OUR DISCOVERING THAT THE DELIGHTFUL PIERROT WAS OUR FRIEND
EPISTOLARY TRUCE OF GOD DURING THE FESTIVITIES OF CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR FROM THE TWENTY FOURTH OF DECEMBER TO THE THIRD OR FOURTH OF JANUARY IT SHALL BE CONSIDERED AN OFFENCE AGAINST GOOD SENSE AND GOOD FEELING TO WRITE OR EXPECT ANY LETTER
IN HER INNOCENCE SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE INTENTION OF THE PERSON WHO HAD ORDERED THE SUPPER AS I LOOKED AT HER I WAS COMPELLED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHE HAD IMPROVED IN BEAUTY IN FACT C C WAS REMARKABLY BEAUTIFUL YET I REMAINED COLD BY HER SIDE
THE FORLORN SILENCE OF THOSE WHO ARE BEREFT OF HOPE AND HAVE ALMOST CEASED TO CARE PRESENTLY EGBERT STARTED FROM HIS SEAT WITH AN AIR OF RESOLUTION THE LIGHT OF BATTLE WAS IN HIS EYES LET ME COME TO THE WRITING TABLE HE EXCLAIMED GLADLY SAID JANETTA
I HAD TWO HOURS TO SPARE BEFORE GOING TO THE CASINO OF MURAN AND I LONGED TO ENJOY THE ASTONISHMENT OF MY BEAUTIFUL NUN WHEN SHE SAW
AS TO BE DECEIVED BY ALL THIS AFFAIR I AM MISERABLE AND IT IS HER DOING THEN I SHOULD BE RIGHT IF I COMPLAINED OF HER ALSO BECAUSE SHE MAKES ME FEEL THAT SHE IS THE MISTRESS OF MY LOVER AND SHE SHEWS ME THAT AFTER SEDUCING HIM FROM ME
ABSORBED IN THAT DARK DISCONTENT I BELIEVED MYSELF WANTONLY TRIFLED WITH DECEIVED DESPISED AND I SPENT HALF AN HOUR SILENT AND GLOOMY STARING AT C C WHO SCARCELY DARED TO BREATHE PERPLEXED CONFUSED AND NOT KNOWING IN WHOSE PRESENCE SHE WAS
IN MY QUALITY OF PIERROT I HAD NO WEAPONS I SEIZED HIM ROUND THE WAIST AND CARRIED HIM ROUND THE PARLOUR RUNNING ALL THE TIME WHILE HE KEPT ON FLOGGING ME I THEN PUT HIM DOWN ADROITLY SNATCHING HIS WAND OUT OF HIS HAND I LIFTED HIS COLUMBINE ON MY SHOULDERS AND PURSUED HIM
NOT SUCH A GOOD FLAVOUR AS THE ONE YOU SENT LAST YEAR WHICH ITSELF WAS NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE HAMS ARE NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE IT WOULD BE A PITY TO BE DEPRIVED OF HER CHRISTMAS COMMENTS BUT THAT LOSS WOULD BE SWALLOWED UP IN THE GENERAL GAIN MEANWHILE SAID JANETTA
IS JUST AS PERFUNCTORY AND CONVENTIONAL AS THE COUNTERFOIL BUSINESS WOULD BE ONLY TEN TIMES MORE TIRESOME AND BRAIN RACKING YOUR PLAN WOULD CERTAINLY BRING THE IDEAL OF A HAPPY CHRISTMAS A STEP NEARER REALISATION SAID JANETTA
I DONT DISPUTE THE NECESSITY BUT I DONT THINK THE SOME ONE SHOULD BE ME SAID JANETTA I WOULDNT MIND WRITING A LETTER OF ANGRY RECRIMINATION OR HEARTLESS SATIRE TO SOME SUITABLE RECIPIENT IN FACT I SHOULD RATHER ENJOY IT
I SPENT THOSE TWO HOURS IN PLAYING AT ALL THE BANKS WINNING LOSING AND PERFORMING ALL SORTS OF ANTICS WITH COMPLETE FREEDOM BEING SATISFIED THAT NO ONE COULD RECOGNIZE ME ENJOYING THE PRESENT BIDDING DEFIANCE TO THE FUTURE
WHAT IS MORE THE COLONEL KNOWS THAT EVEN IF WE HAD TAKEN A SUDDEN AVERSION TO STILTON OR BEEN FORBIDDEN IT BY THE DOCTOR WE SHOULD STILL HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER OF HEARTY THANKS AROUND IT SO YOU SEE THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT
SHE WILL SHEW HERSELF IN GOOD TIME WITH THAT IDEA I TOOK OFF THE GAUZE WHICH COVERED MY FEATURES MY LOVELY C C GAVE A DEEP SIGH AND SAID I BREATHE AGAIN IT COULD NOT BE ANYONE BUT YOU MY HEART FELT IT
THAT WISH OF YOURS TO GIVE ME UP YOUR PLACE WHEN YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT I WAS HAPPY WITH M M AROSE FROM YOUR FRIENDSHIP RATHER THAN FROM YOUR LOVE AND FOR THE PRESENT I MUST BE GLAD TO SEE THAT YOUR FRIENDSHIP IS STRONGER THAN YOUR LOVE
IT IS NOT THE SAME WITH M M THAT LOVE CANNOT SPRING UP AGAIN INTO EXISTENCE IS IT NOT HUMILIATING FOR ME TO HAVE INSPIRED HER WITH NOTHING BUT A PASSING FANCY I UNDERSTAND YOUR ADORATION FOR HER VERY WELL
I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN OUR PASSING A WHOLE NIGHT TOGETHER AS INNOCENTLY AS IF WE WERE BROTHER AND SISTER IF SHE KNOWS YOU AS WELL AS I DO SHE WILL INDEED THINK IT MOST WONDERFUL IN THAT CASE YOU MAY TELL HER THE CONTRARY IF YOU LIKE
AND MY MIND WAS AS MUCH STUPEFIED AS MY BODY I FOUND MYSELF IN AN INEXTRICABLE MAZE IT IS M M I SAID TO MYSELF WHO HAS PLAYED THAT TRICK UPON ME BUT HOW HAS SHE CONTRIVED TO KNOW THAT I AM THE LOVER OF C C
AFTER THE MINUET I DANCED TWELVE FORLANAS WITH THE GREATEST VIGOUR OUT OF BREATH I THREW MYSELF ON A SOFA PRETENDING TO GO TO SLEEP AND THE MOMENT I BEGAN TO SNORE EVERYBODY RESPECTED THE SLUMBERS OF PIERROT
COLONEL CHUTTLE KNOWS THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE STILTON WITHOUT HAVING TO BE TOLD SO AND THE FROPLINSONS KNOW THAT WE ARE BORED WITH THEIR CALENDAR WHATEVER WE MAY SAY TO THE CONTRARY JUST AS WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE BORED WITH THE BRIDGE MARKERS IN SPITE OF THEIR WRITTEN ASSURANCE THAT THEY THANKED US FOR OUR CHARMING LITTLE GIFT
OR COMMUNICATION THAT DOES NOT DEAL WITH THE NECESSARY EVENTS OF THE MOMENT ANSWERS TO INVITATIONS ARRANGEMENTS ABOUT TRAINS RENEWAL OF CLUB SUBSCRIPTIONS AND OF COURSE ALL THE ORDINARY EVERYDAY AFFAIRS OF BUSINESS SICKNESS
SHE HAD GOOD REASON TO FEAR FOR SUDDENLY A FOOLISH MERRY ANDREW CAME BEHIND ME TRIPPED ME UP AND DOWN I TUMBLED EVERYBODY HOOTED MASTER PUNCH I QUICKLY PICKED MYSELF UP AND RATHER VEXED I BEGAN A REGULAR FIGHT WITH THE INSOLENT FELLOW
WHAT TROUBLE DID THEY TAKE TO FIND OUT WHETHER WE READ WORDSWORTH WITH GLADNESS FOR ALL THEY KNEW OR CARED WE MIGHT BE FRANTICALLY EMBEDDED IN THE BELIEF THAT ALL POETRY BEGINS AND ENDS WITH JOHN MASEFIELD AND IT MIGHT INFURIATE OR DEPRESS US TO HAVE A DAILY SAMPLE OF WORDSWORTHIAN PRODUCTS FLUNG AT US
WITH A QUOTATION OF ONE OF HIS GREAT THOUGHTS FOR EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR IMPOSSIBLE SAID EGBERT HE DIDNT HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUGHTS IN THE WHOLE OF HIS LIFE OR IF HE DID HE KEPT THEM TO HIMSELF HE WAS A MAN OF ACTION NOT OF INTROSPECTION
OH SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE NEW YEAR HONOURS LIST A FRIEND OF OURS MADE SUCH A CLEVER REMARK WHEN HE READ IT THEN YOU CAN STICK IN ANY REMARK THAT COMES INTO YOUR HEAD IT NEEDNT BE CLEVER THE FROPLINSONS WONT KNOW WHETHER IT IS OR ISNT
HAS C C BETRAYED MY SECRET BUT IF SHE HAS BETRAYED IT HOW COULD M M DEPRIVE HERSELF OF THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ME AND CONSENT TO HER PLACE BEING TAKEN BY HER FRIEND AND RIVAL THAT CANNOT BE A MARK OF KIND COMPLIANCE FOR A WOMAN NEVER CARRIES IT TO SUCH AN EXTREME
I REMARKED MY TWO FRIENDS TOGETHER AND VERY INTENT UPON THE DANCERS I THEN WALKED ROUND THE ROOM EYEING EVERYBODY FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND CALLING THE GENERAL ATTENTION UPON MYSELF
YOUR GLOOMY SILENCE FRIGHTENED ME AND I WOULD NEVER HAVE DARED TO BE THE FIRST IN BREAKING IT THE MORE SO THAT IN SPITE OF THE FEELINGS OF MY HEART I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN
I I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF SUCH A THING EVEN IF DEATH HAD STARED ME IN THE FACE THEN HOW DID YOU COME HERE HOW DID YOUR FRIEND CONTRIVE TO DISCOVER EVERYTHING
BUT WHAT SHALL I TELL HER THE WHOLE TRUTH DO NOT KEEP FROM HER A SINGLE WORD OF OUR CONVERSATION AS FAR AS YOUR MEMORY WILL SERVE YOU AND TELL HER ESPECIALLY THAT SHE HAS MADE ME MISERABLE FOR A LONG TIME
SHE PROVES BY SENDING ME HERE IN HER PLACE THAT SHE IS PLEASED TO SEE YOUR HEART DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND ME YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT SHE LOVES ME AND THAT I AM OFTEN EITHER HER WIFE OR HER HUSBAND
CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT IT IF I HAD EVER LEFT THE CONVENT EVEN ONCE
SHE THOUGHT VERY LIKELY THAT YOU STILL LOVED ME AND SHE IMAGINED FOR I KNOW HER WELL THAT SHE COULD NOT GIVE US A GREATER PROOF OF HER LOVE THAN BY PROCURING US WITHOUT FOREWARNING US THAT WHICH TWO LOVERS FOND OF EACH OTHER MUST WISH FOR SO ARDENTLY
THESE SHOULD BE SWEPT AWAY TO GIVE THE SEASON A CHANCE OF BEING REALLY FESTIVE A TIME OF UNTROUBLED UNPUNCTUATED PEACE AND GOOD WILL BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SOME ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF PRESENTS RECEIVED OBJECTED JANETTA OTHERWISE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER KNOW WHETHER THEY HAD ARRIVED SAFELY
I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THERE IS NO MERIT IN BEING FAITHFUL TO THE PERSON WE TRULY LOVE TWO HOURS BEFORE DAY LIGHT WE RESUMED OUR SEATS NEAR THE FIRE AND C C SEEING HOW DULL I WAS WAS DELICATELY ATTENTIVE TO ME SHE ATTEMPTED NO ALLUREMENT
BUT THAT IS PRECISELY OUR CASE AND YOU ARE MISTAKEN WE ARE NOT ANGRY AT YOUR LOVING US BOTH EQUALLY HAVE I NOT WRITTEN TO YOU THAT I WOULD MOST WILLINGLY GIVE YOU MY PLACE NEAR M M THEN YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT I DESPISE YOU LIKEWISE MY DARLING
I COULD NOT TOUCH ANYTHING MY HEART WAS TOO FULL BUT MY DEAR LITTLE WIFE SUPPED WITH A GOOD APPETITE I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING WHEN I SAW A SALAD OF WHITES OF EGGS AND C C THOUGHT IT EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE ALL THE YOLKS HAD BEEN REMOVED
I WENT AT ONCE TO THE CONVENT THE PARLOUR WAS FULL BUT THANKS TO MY COSTUME OF PIERROT WHICH WAS SEEN IN VENICE BUT VERY SELDOM EVERYBODY MADE ROOM FOR ME I WALKED ON ASSUMING THE GAIT OF A BOOBY THE TRUE CHARACTERISTIC OF MY COSTUME
STRIKING HIM WITH THE WAND TO THE GREAT DELIGHT AND MIRTH OF THE COMPANY THE COLUMBINE WAS SCREAMING BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID OF MY TUMBLING DOWN AND OF SHEWING HER CENTRE OF GRAVITY TO EVERYBODY IN THE FALL
AND JUST IN THE SAME MANNER THAT I AM NOT SORRY TO KNOW THAT YOU LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND THAT YOU MAKE EACH OTHER HAPPY AS THIS BEAUTIFUL CASINO PROVES TO ME SHE DOES NOT REGRET OUR LOVE AND SHE IS ON THE CONTRARY DELIGHTED TO SHEW US THAT SHE APPROVES OF IT
YOU SEEMED SURPRISED WHEN YOU SAW ME DEAREST DID YOU NOT KNOW THAT I WAS WAITING FOR YOU I HAD NOT THE FAINTEST IDEA OF IT IF YOU ARE ANGRY I REGRET IT DEEPLY BUT I AM INNOCENT MY ADORED FRIEND COME TO MY ARMS AND NEVER SUPPOSE THAT I CAN BE ANGRY WITH YOU
RECOLLECT THAT FOR THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS I HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE HAPPINESS OF KISSING YOU AND NOW THAT YOU MUST BE CERTAIN OF MY INNOCENCE ALLOW ME TO CONGRATULATE YOU UPON KNOWING THIS CASINO YOU ARE HAPPY AND I CONGRATULATE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART
SHE HAS INITIATED YOU INTO ALL HER MYSTERIES AND YOU OWE HER ETERNAL FRIENDSHIP AND EVERLASTING GRATITUDE IT WAS MIDNIGHT AND WE WENT ON WASTING OUR TIME IN THIS DESULTORY CONVERSATION WHEN THE PRUDENT AND CAREFUL SERVANT BROUGHT US AN EXCELLENT SUPPER
SOUNDS DELIGHTFULLY SIMPLE SAID JANETTA WISTFULLY BUT PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER IT TOO CUT AND DRIED TOO PERFUNCTORY IT IS NOT A BIT MORE PERFUNCTORY THAN THE PRESENT SYSTEM SAID EGBERT
SHE WISHED TO MAKE US HAPPY AND I CANNOT BE ANGRY WITH HER FOR IT YOU ARE RIGHT TO THINK SO DEAREST BUT MY POSITION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM YOURS YOU HAVE NOT ANOTHER LOVER YOU COULD NOT HAVE ANOTHER BUT I BEING FREE AND UNABLE TO SEE YOU
ONE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO NOTICE SOCIAL DEFORMITIES OF THAT SORT SAID JANETTA IT WOULDNT BE POLITE BESIDES
WHERE KINDNESS IS THE RAREST OF PEARLS THE MAN WHO IS KINDLY ALMOST TAKES PRECEDENCE OF THE MAN WHO IS GREAT LOUIS PHILIPPE HAVING BEEN SEVERELY JUDGED BY SOME HARSHLY PERHAPS BY OTHERS
THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE THEY HAD RISEN IN BED IN THE DARK NAIL IN HAND AND THEIR PROJECT IN THEIR HEADS A FEW MOMENTS LATER THEY HAD JOINED BABET AND MONTPARNASSE WHO WERE PROWLING ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AT THAT VERY MOMENT A PORTION OF THE SLATES ON THE PRISON THE SAINT BERNARD COURTYARD WAS NO LONGER ABSOLUTELY ISOLATED FROM THE CHARLEMAGNE AND THE SAINT LOUIS COURTS UP ABOVE THERE WERE SCAFFOLDINGS AND LADDERS IN OTHER WORDS
THAT AS IT TURNS EVERYTHING TO SUCCESS IT ADMITS OF RUSE AND DOES NOT ABSOLUTELY REPUDIATE BASENESS BUT WHICH HAS THIS VALUABLE SIDE THAT IT PRESERVES POLITICS FROM VIOLENT SHOCKS THE STATE FROM FRACTURES AND SOCIETY FROM CATASTROPHES
HE GAVE LESSONS IN MATHEMATICS WHILE HIS SISTER ADELAIDE DID WOOL WORK AND SEWED THESE SOUVENIRS CONNECTED WITH A KING RENDERED THE BOURGEOISIE ENTHUSIASTIC
WHEN ONE ENTERED FROM THE NORTH END ONE HAD ON ONE'S LEFT THE FOUR DORMER WINDOWS ON ONE'S RIGHT
THIS WAS BRUJON THENARDIER RECOGNIZED HIM AND UNDERSTOOD THIS WAS ENOUGH THENARDIER RATED AS A BURGLAR
NO ONE WAS EVER ABLE TO DISCOVER HOW AND BY WHAT CONNIVANCE HE SUCCEEDED IN PROCURING AND SECRETING A BOTTLE OF WINE INVENTED SO IT IS SAID BY DESRUES WITH WHICH A NARCOTIC IS MIXED
THE PEERAGE SHELTERING ITSELF BEHIND BECCARIA TO REFUSE FOUR HEADS TO THE LAW
DEUTZ BOUGHT PRITCHARD PAID THESE ARE THE DOINGS OF THE REIGN THE POLICY WHICH WAS MORE DOMESTIC THAN NATIONAL WAS THE DOING OF THE KING AS WILL BE SEEN THE PROPER DEDUCTION HAVING BEEN MADE
WITH CONVICTION INACCESSIBLE TO DESPONDENCY TO LASSITUDE TO THE TASTE FOR THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE IDEAL
SOCIAL PROSPERITY MEANS THE MAN HAPPY THE CITIZEN FREE THE NATION GREAT ENGLAND SOLVES THE FIRST OF THESE TWO PROBLEMS SHE CREATES WEALTH ADMIRABLY SHE DIVIDES IT BADLY
THE UNFORESEEN NECESSITY FOR THE STATESMAN TO TAKE PHILOSOPHERS INTO ACCOUNT CONFUSED EVIDENCES OF WHICH WE CATCH A GLIMPSE A NEW SYSTEM OF POLITICS TO BE CREATED
FORCED AND THE TWO REDOUBTABLE RUFFIANS WERE ON THE ROOF THE WIND AND RAIN REDOUBLED THE ROOF WAS SLIPPERY WHAT A GOOD NIGHT TO LEG IT SAID BRUJON
WHILE HE REIGNED THE PRESS WAS FREE THE TRIBUNE WAS FREE CONSCIENCE AND SPEECH WERE FREE THE LAWS OF SEPTEMBER ARE OPEN TO SIGHT ALTHOUGH FULLY AWARE OF THE GNAWING POWER OF LIGHT ON PRIVILEGES
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL MALADY BREAKING OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE TWO CAPITALS OF THE KINGDOM THE ONE IN THE CITY OF THOUGHT THE OTHER IN THE CITY OF TOIL AT PARIS CIVIL WAR AT LYONS SERVILE WAR IN THE TWO CITIES
TAKEN IN HIMSELF AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF HUMAN GOODNESS WILL REMAIN TO USE THE ANTIQUE LANGUAGE OF ANCIENT HISTORY ONE OF THE BEST PRINCES WHO EVER SAT ON A THRONE WHAT IS THERE AGAINST HIM THAT THRONE
WHO PLUNDER THE ROOFS AND DESPOIL THE GUTTERS BY THE PROCESS CALLED DOUBLE PICKINGS THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH PUT THE FINISHING TOUCH ON THE MOMENT PECULIARLY FAVORABLE FOR AN ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE
THE ROYALISTS JEERED AT THIS RIDICULOUS KING THE FIRST WHO HAD EVER SHED BLOOD
CHAPTER THREE THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT
THE PRISONER HAD ON HIS FEET FETTERS WEIGHING FIFTY POUNDS EVERY DAY AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON A JAILER ESCORTED BY TWO DOGS THIS WAS STILL IN VOGUE AT THAT TIME ENTERED HIS CAGE DEPOSITED BESIDE HIS BED A LOAF OF BLACK BREAD
BRUJON AFTER HAVING PASSED A MONTH IN THE PUNISHMENT CELL HAD HAD TIME IN THE FIRST PLACE TO WEAVE A ROPE IN THE SECOND TO MATURE A PLAN IN FORMER TIMES
HE RETURNED AT NIGHT TO HIS APARTMENTS AND THERE EXHAUSTED WITH FATIGUE OVERWHELMED WITH SLEEP WHAT DID HE DO HE TOOK A DEATH SENTENCE AND PASSED THE NIGHT IN REVISING A CRIMINAL SUIT
THERE ROSE ABOVE THAT ROTUNDA AN ENORMOUS BLACK HIDEOUS BARE WALL BY WHICH IT WAS BACKED UP THIS WAS THE OUTER WALL OF LA FORCE THIS WALL BESIDE THAT ROTUNDA WAS MILTON VIEWED THROUGH BERQUIN
THE DISTRIBUTION OF ENJOYMENT FROM THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF FORCES RESULTS PUBLIC POWER FROM A GOOD DISTRIBUTION OF ENJOYMENTS RESULTS INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS
AND FROM EACH MISINTERPRETATION A FACTION AND EACH PARTY THINKS THAT IT ALONE HAS THE TRUE TEXT
SHOWERS MINGLED WITH THUNDER SHOOK THE DOORS ON THEIR HINGES AND CREATED IN THE PRISON A TERRIBLE AND OPPORTUNE UPROAR
DIFFUSE IN PUBLIC CONCISE IN PRIVATE REPUTED BUT NOT PROVED TO BE A MISER AT BOTTOM ONE OF THOSE ECONOMISTS WHO ARE READILY PRODIGAL AT THEIR OWN FANCY OR DUTY LETTERED
WHO SELL TO THE POLICE AN UNFAITHFUL SERVICE AND WHO TURN A PENNY WHENEVER THEY CAN ON THAT SAME NIGHT THEN WHEN LITTLE GAVROCHE PICKED UP THE TWO LOST CHILDREN
IT WAS ANGUISH TO HIM TO ABANDON THESE MISERABLE CONDEMNED HEADS ONE DAY HE SAID TO THE SAME WITNESS TO WHOM WE HAVE RECENTLY REFERRED I WON SEVEN LAST NIGHT DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF HIS REIGN
TOO MUCH OF A PATERNAL KING THAT INCUBATION OF A FAMILY
THE ONE ENTERED INTO THE OTHER AND THE INCARNATION TOOK PLACE LOUIS PHILIPPE IS EIGHTEEN THIRTY MADE MAN MOREOVER HE HAD IN HIS FAVOR THAT GREAT RECOMMENDATION TO THE THRONE EXILE
IT IS INDIVISIBLE AND ALL ON ONE SIDE BUT THOSE WHO ARE IN ERROR ARE SO SINCERELY A BLIND MAN IS NO MORE A CRIMINAL THAN A VENDEAN IS A RUFFIAN
THE DEATH PENALTY WAS AS GOOD AS ABOLISHED AND THE ERECTION OF A SCAFFOLD WAS A VIOLENCE COMMITTED AGAINST THE KING
THENARDIER HAD OBTAINED PERMISSION TO KEEP A SORT OF IRON BOLT WHICH HE USED TO SPIKE HIS BREAD INTO A CRACK IN THE WALL IN ORDER TO PRESERVE IT FROM THE RATS AS HE SAID
TRAVERSED BY REVOLUTIONARY CURRENTS TREMBLED UNDER THEM WITH INDESCRIBABLY VAGUE EPILEPTIC SHOCKS THESE DREAMERS SOME ISOLATED OTHERS UNITED IN FAMILIES AND ALMOST IN COMMUNION TURNED OVER SOCIAL QUESTIONS IN A PACIFIC
AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE IT AND YOU WILL HAVE AT ONCE MORAL AND MATERIAL GREATNESS AND YOU WILL BE WORTHY TO CALL YOURSELF FRANCE THIS IS WHAT SOCIALISM SAID OUTSIDE AND ABOVE A FEW SECTS WHICH HAVE GONE ASTRAY
THIS SOLUTION WHICH IS COMPLETE ON ONE SIDE ONLY LEADS HER FATALLY TO TWO EXTREMES MONSTROUS OPULENCE MONSTROUS WRETCHEDNESS ALL ENJOYMENTS FOR SOME ALL PRIVATIONS FOR THE REST
MAKING USE WITHOUT MERCY OF SUPERIORITY ON MEDIOCRITY
CRACKS BENEATH THE FOUNDATION
THE SAME GLARE OF THE FURNACE A CRATER LIKE CRIMSON ON THE BROW OF THE PEOPLE THE SOUTH RENDERED FANATIC THE WEST TROUBLED THE DUCHESSE DE BERRY IN LA VENDEE PLOTS CONSPIRACIES
NO OBJECTION HAD BEEN MADE TO THIS SPIKE STILL IT WAS REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS THAT ONE OF THE JAILERS HAD SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER TO LET HIM HAVE ONLY A WOODEN SPIKE AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE SENTINEL WHO WAS AN OLD SOLDIER
MILITARY EXECUTION OF INSURRECTIONS THE RISING PASSED OVER BY ARMS THE RUE TRANSNONAIN THE COUNSELS OF WAR THE ABSORPTION OF THE REAL COUNTRY BY THE LEGAL COUNTRY ON HALF SHARES WITH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRIVILEGED PERSONS
AND WOULD BE RANKED AMONG THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS GOVERNORS OF HISTORY HAD HE LOVED GLORY BUT A LITTLE AND IF HE HAD HAD THE SENTIMENT OF WHAT IS GREAT TO THE SAME DEGREE AS THE FEELING FOR WHAT IS USEFUL
THEIR ECLIPSE IS NEVER AN ABDICATION NEVERTHELESS LET US NOT BOAST TOO LOUDLY REVOLUTIONS ALSO MAY BE DECEIVED AND GRAVE ERRORS HAVE BEEN SEEN LET US RETURN TO EIGHTEEN THIRTY
ALL THAT CAN BE DESIGNATED AS THE INVISIBLE CURRENTS OF CONSCIENCES ACCEPTED BY THE SURFACE BUT LITTLE IN ACCORD WITH FRANCE LOWER DOWN EXTRICATING HIMSELF BY DINT OF TACT GOVERNING TOO MUCH AND NOT ENOUGH
HE WAS A BIT OF A MASON A BIT OF A GARDENER SOMETHING OF A DOCTOR HE BLED A POSTILION WHO HAD TUMBLED FROM HIS HORSE LOUIS PHILIPPE NO MORE WENT ABOUT WITHOUT HIS LANCET THAN DID
SO BRUJON MEDITATED
THE CROSS TORN FROM NOTRE DAME LAFAYETTE LESSENED LAFFITTE RUINED BENJAMIN CONSTANT DEAD IN INDIGENCE CASIMIR PERIER DEAD IN THE EXHAUSTION OF HIS POWER
IN DEFAULT OF A CUIRASS IN ITS LACK OF LOGIC THEY ATTACKED THIS REVOLUTION IN ITS ROYALTY THEY SHOUTED TO IT REVOLUTION
A LARGE CHIMNEY FLUE PROBABLY FROM SOME ANCIENT KITCHEN OF THE DUKES DE LA FORCE STARTED
THAT IS TO SAY FOR THE PEOPLE PRIVILEGE EXCEPTION MONOPOLY FEUDALISM BORN FROM TOIL ITSELF A FALSE AND DANGEROUS SITUATION WHICH SATES PUBLIC POWER OR PRIVATE MISERY
PERHAPS AN EVENTUAL INDEFINABLE RESIGNATION BORN OF THE VAGUE ACCEPTANCE OF A SUPERIOR DEFINITIVE RIGHT HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN OF HIS RACE HIS DOMESTIC SPIRIT HIS SINCERE RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE HIS OWN HONESTY
THE KING'S CHARGE IS DECREASED THIS IS HIS GREAT FAULT HE WAS MODEST IN THE NAME OF FRANCE WHENCE ARISES THIS FAULT
THE MONARCHY RISE THROUGH THE SHADOWS AND THERE HAD LINGERED IN HIS SOUL THE RESPECTFUL FEAR OF THESE IMMENSE JUSTICES OF THE POPULACE WHICH ARE ALMOST AS IMPERSONAL AS THE JUSTICE OF GOD
AND THE RIBBON OF THE LEGION OF HONOR LIKE NAPOLEON HE WENT A LITTLE TO CHAPEL NOT AT ALL TO THE CHASE NEVER TO THE OPERA
CHANCE ORDAINED THAT THE HEADS OF THEIR BEDS SHOULD REST AGAINST THE CHIMNEY
THIS TRANQUILLITY WAS NOT THE LEAST BEAUTIFUL SPECTACLE OF THIS AGITATED EPOCH THESE MEN LEFT TO POLITICAL PARTIES THE QUESTION OF RIGHTS THEY OCCUPIED THEMSELVES WITH THE QUESTION OF HAPPINESS THE WELL BEING OF MAN
IN CIVILIZATION SUCH AS IT HAS FORMED ITSELF A LITTLE BY THE COMMAND OF GOD A GREAT DEAL BY THE AGENCY OF MAN INTERESTS COMBINE UNITE AND AMALGAMATE IN A MANNER TO FORM A VERITABLE HARD ROCK IN ACCORDANCE WITH A DYNAMIC LAW
AS AN INTELLIGENCE RATHER THAN AS A KING ENDOWED WITH OBSERVATION AND NOT WITH DIVINATION NOT VERY ATTENTIVE TO MINDS BUT KNOWING MEN THAT IS TO SAY REQUIRING TO SEE IN ORDER TO JUDGE
AND TO CAUSE IT TO SPOUT FORTH THE LIVING WATERS OF HUMAN FELICITY FROM THE QUESTION OF THE SCAFFOLD TO THE QUESTION OF WAR THEIR WORKS EMBRACED EVERYTHING
COURAGEOUS AS A THINKER UNEASY ONLY IN THE FACE OF THE CHANCES OF A EUROPEAN SHAKING UP AND UNFITTED FOR GREAT POLITICAL ADVENTURES ALWAYS READY TO RISK HIS LIFE NEVER HIS WORK
WHICH SURVIVES EVEN WHEN STAINED WITH BLOOD REVOLUTIONS SPRING NOT FROM AN ACCIDENT BUT FROM NECESSITY A REVOLUTION IS A RETURN FROM THE FICTITIOUS TO THE REAL IT IS BECAUSE IT MUST BE THAT IT IS
MINUTE CORRECT VIGILANT ATTENTIVE SAGACIOUS INDEFATIGABLE CONTRADICTING HIMSELF AT TIMES AND GIVING HIMSELF THE LIE BOLD AGAINST AUSTRIA AT ANCONA OBSTINATE AGAINST ENGLAND IN SPAIN
PHILOSOPHICAL FERMENTATION REPLIED TO DEMOCRATIC FERMENTATION THE ELECT FELT TROUBLED AS WELL AS THE MASSES IN ANOTHER MANNER BUT QUITE AS MUCH THINKERS MEDITATED WHILE THE SOIL THAT IS TO SAY THE PEOPLE
HE HAD LOOKED ON THOSE THINGS HE HAD CONTEMPLATED THAT GIDDINESS HE HAD SEEN THE CENTURIES APPEAR BEFORE THE BAR OF THE ASSEMBLY CONVENTION HE HAD BEHELD
FLUNG THE OTHER OVER THE OUTER WALL CROSSED THE ABYSS AT ONE BOUND CLUNG TO THE COPING OF THE WALL GOT ASTRIDE OF IT LET THEMSELVES SLIP ONE AFTER THE OTHER ALONG THE ROPE UPON A LITTLE ROOF WHICH TOUCHES THE BATH HOUSE
HE WORE THE UNIFORM OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
AND THAT THE ACCEPTANCE OF IT WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH DUTY HENCE HIS POSSESSION WAS IN GOOD FAITH NOW WE SAY IT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE LOUIS PHILIPPE BEING IN POSSESSION IN PERFECT GOOD FAITH AND THE DEMOCRACY BEING IN GOOD FAITH IN ITS ATTACK
WHICH SETS THE ROOTS OF THE STATE IN THE SUFFERINGS OF THE INDIVIDUAL A BADLY CONSTITUTED GRANDEUR IN WHICH ARE COMBINED ALL THE MATERIAL ELEMENTS AND INTO WHICH NO MORAL ELEMENT ENTERS COMMUNISM
BRIDGES AND STAIRS IN THE DIRECTION OF LIBERTY THE NEW BUILDING WHICH WAS THE MOST CRACKED AND DECREPIT THING TO BE SEEN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WAS THE WEAK POINT IN THE PRISON
BY A GOOD DISTRIBUTION NOT AN EQUAL BUT AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION MUST BE UNDERSTOOD FROM THESE TWO THINGS COMBINED THE PUBLIC POWER WITHOUT INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS WITHIN RESULTS SOCIAL PROSPERITY
THE TRACE LEFT IN HIM BY THE REVOLUTION WAS PRODIGIOUS ITS MEMORY WAS LIKE A LIVING IMPRINT OF THOSE GREAT YEARS MINUTE BY MINUTE ONE DAY IN THE PRESENCE OF A WITNESS WHOM WE ARE NOT PERMITTED TO DOUBT
ALL THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT FOR THE HUMAN RACE EITHER A VIRTUE OR AN IDEA IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD HERE THAT BY THE WORDS VENICE ENGLAND WE DESIGNATE NOT THE PEOPLES BUT SOCIAL STRUCTURES
THE DEMOCRACY DEFENDS THE PEOPLE THE RELATIVE WHICH IS THE MONARCHY RESISTS THE ABSOLUTE WHICH IS THE REPUBLIC SOCIETY BLEEDS IN THIS CONFLICT BUT THAT WHICH CONSTITUTES ITS SUFFERING TO DAY WILL CONSTITUTE ITS SAFETY LATER ON
HE RECTIFIED FROM MEMORY THE WHOLE OF THE LETTER A IN THE ALPHABETICAL LIST OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
FROM METTERNICH THIS EULOGIUM THEY ARE YOUNG PEOPLE SUCH AS ARE RARELY SEEN AND PRINCES SUCH AS ARE NEVER SEEN THIS WITHOUT ANY DISSIMULATION AND ALSO WITHOUT ANY EXAGGERATION
BELGIUM OFFERING HERSELF TO A FRENCH PRINCE AND GIVING HERSELF TO AN ENGLISH PRINCE THE RUSSIAN HATRED OF NICOLAS BEHIND US THE DEMONS OF THE SOUTH FERDINAND IN SPAIN MIGUEL IN PORTUGAL THE EARTH QUAKING IN ITALY
EVERY REVOLUTION BEING A NORMAL OUTCOME CONTAINS WITHIN ITSELF ITS LEGITIMACY WHICH FALSE REVOLUTIONISTS SOMETIMES DISHONOR BUT WHICH REMAINS EVEN WHEN SOILED
RESISTANCE WAS BORN ON THE MORROW PERHAPS EVEN IT WAS BORN ON THE PRECEDING EVENING FROM MONTH TO MONTH THE HOSTILITY INCREASED AND FROM BEING CONCEALED IT BECAME PATENT THE REVOLUTION OF JULY
SPIRITS TREMBLED IN THE SOCIAL ANXIETY LIKE LEAVES AT THE APPROACH OF A STORM THE ELECTRIC TENSION WAS SUCH THAT AT CERTAIN INSTANTS THE FIRST COMER A STRANGER BROUGHT LIGHT THEN THE TWILIGHT OBSCURITY CLOSED IN AGAIN
OF HIS FORTUNE OF HIS PERSON OF HIS AFFAIRS KNOWING THE VALUE OF A MINUTE AND NOT ALWAYS THE VALUE OF A YEAR SOBER SERENE PEACEABLE PATIENT A GOOD MAN AND A GOOD PRINCE SLEEPING WITH HIS WIFE
THINK THAT REVOLUTIONS HAVING SPRUNG FROM THE RIGHT TO REVOLT ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO REVOLT AGAINST THEM ERROR FOR IN THESE REVOLUTIONS THE ONE WHO REVOLTS IS NOT THE PEOPLE IT IS THE KING
PREOCCUPIED LOUIS PHILIPPE ALMOST PAINFULLY AND THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN STRONG AND COURAGEOUS AS HE WAS HE WAS OVERWHELMED BY THE DIFFICULTIES OF BEING A KING HE FELT UNDER HIS FEET A FORMIDABLE DISAGGREGATION
WITH ARMED FORCE WAS KEPT IN SIGHT THE SENTRY WHO WAS RELIEVED EVERY TWO HOURS MARCHED UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF HIS CAGE WITH LOADED MUSKET
BOMBARDING ANTWERP AND PAYING OFF PRITCHARD
A MATERIAL POWER YOU WILL BE THE WICKED RICH MAN YOU WILL DIE BY AN ACT OF VIOLENCE AS VENICE DIED OR BY BANKRUPTCY AS ENGLAND WILL FALL AND THE WORLD WILL ALLOW TO DIE AND FALL ALL THAT IS MERELY SELFISHNESS
THEY ARE MISTAKEN THEIR DIVISION KILLS PRODUCTION EQUAL PARTITION ABOLISHES EMULATION AND CONSEQUENTLY LABOR IT IS A PARTITION MADE BY THE BUTCHER WHICH KILLS THAT WHICH IT DIVIDES
THE WALLS WERE EATEN BY SALTPETRE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO LINE THE VAULTS OF THE DORMITORIES WITH A SHEATHING OF WOOD BECAUSE STONES WERE IN THE HABIT OF BECOMING DETACHED AND FALLING ON THE PRISONERS IN THEIR BEDS
AT INTERVALS DEEP AND DULL MUTTERINGS ALLOWED A JUDGMENT TO BE FORMED AS TO THE QUANTITY OF THUNDER CONTAINED BY THE CLOUD TWENTY MONTHS HAD BARELY ELAPSED SINCE THE REVOLUTION OF JULY THE YEAR EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
A CHIMNEY PIERCED THE ROOF THIS WAS THE CHIMNEY WHICH TRAVERSED THE DORMITORIES THE BEL AIR THAT TOP STORY OF THE NEW BUILDING WAS A SORT OF
THE TWO PROBLEMS MUST BE COMBINED AND MADE BUT ONE SOLVE ONLY THE FIRST OF THE TWO PROBLEMS YOU WILL BE VENICE YOU WILL BE ENGLAND YOU WILL HAVE LIKE VENICE AN ARTIFICIAL POWER OR LIKE ENGLAND
ROSE SOFTLY AND WITH THE NAIL WHICH BRUJON HAD FOUND BEGAN TO PIERCE THE CHIMNEY AGAINST WHICH THEIR BEDS STOOD THE RUBBISH FELL ON BRUJON'S BED SO THAT THEY WERE NOT HEARD
PILES OF SHADOWS COVERED THE HORIZON A STRANGE SHADE GRADUALLY DRAWING NEARER EXTENDED LITTLE BY LITTLE OVER MEN OVER THINGS OVER IDEAS A SHADE WHICH CAME FROM WRATHS AND SYSTEMS
TO HAVE THAT DISQUIETING SIDE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHICH BECOMES REASSURING IN GOVERNING POWER THEREIN LAY THE FORTUNE OF LOUIS PHILIPPE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NEVER WAS THERE A MORE COMPLETE ADAPTATION OF A MAN TO AN EVENT
KNOWING DEEDS FACTS DETAILS DATES PROPER NAMES IGNORANT OF TENDENCIES PASSIONS THE DIVERSE GENIUSES OF THE CROWD THE INTERIOR ASPIRATIONS THE HIDDEN AND OBSCURE UPRISINGS OF SOULS IN A WORD
THERE REMAINS THE MAN AND THE MAN IS GOOD HE IS GOOD AT TIMES EVEN TO THE POINT OF BEING ADMIRABLE OFTEN IN THE MIDST OF HIS GRAVEST SOUVENIRS AFTER A DAY OF CONFLICT WITH THE WHOLE DIPLOMACY OF THE CONTINENT
IS EVIDENTLY AND ABOVE ALL THINGS ENTIRELY DISINTERESTED AN EPITAPH PENNED BY A DEAD MAN IS SINCERE
ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THE SOCIALISTS PROPOSED TO THEMSELVES COSMOGONIC VISIONS REVERY AND MYSTICISM BEING CAST ASIDE CAN BE REDUCED TO TWO PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS FIRST PROBLEM TO PRODUCE WEALTH
IN SPITE OF THIS ANTIQUITY THE AUTHORITIES COMMITTED THE ERROR OF CONFINING IN THE NEW BUILDING THE MOST TROUBLESOME PRISONERS OF PLACING THERE THE HARD CASES AS THEY SAY IN PRISON PARLANCE THE NEW BUILDING
THESE ARE THE DEEDS OF ROYALTY BELGIUM REFUSED ALGERIA TOO HARSHLY CONQUERED AND AS IN THE CASE OF INDIA BY THE ENGLISH WITH MORE BARBARISM THAN CIVILIZATION
FACTIONS ARE BLIND MEN WHO AIM CORRECTLY THIS CRY WAS UTTERED EQUALLY BY THE REPUBLICANS BUT COMING FROM THEM THIS CRY WAS LOGICAL
LOUIS PHILIPPE ANNOTATED BECCARIA WITH HIS OWN HAND AFTER THE FIESCHI MACHINE HE EXCLAIMED WHAT A PITY THAT I WAS NOT WOUNDED THEN I MIGHT HAVE PARDONED ON ANOTHER OCCASION ALLUDING TO THE RESISTANCE OFFERED BY HIS MINISTRY
AN INDESCRIBABLE SPIRIT OF PROCEEDINGS AND CHICANERY THE FOUNDER AND LAWYER OF A DYNASTY HAVING SOMETHING OF CHARLEMAGNE AND SOMETHING OF AN ATTORNEY IN SHORT A LOFTY AND ORIGINAL FIGURE A PRINCE WHO UNDERSTOOD
BEHOLDS A YARD FULL OF FLOWERS AND SHRUBS IN WOODEN BOXES AT THE EXTREMITY OF WHICH SPREADS OUT A LITTLE WHITE ROTUNDA WITH TWO WINGS BRIGHTENED UP WITH GREEN SHUTTERS THE BUCOLIC DREAM OF JEAN JACQUES NOT MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO
THE BLIND CLAIRVOYANCE OF THE REVOLUTION BREAKING ROYALTY IN THE KING AND THE KING WITH ROYALTY DID SO ALMOST WITHOUT NOTICING THE MAN IN THE FIERCE CRUSHING OF THE IDEA THE VAST STORM OF THE ASSEMBLY TRIBUNAL
AND A BIT OF IT REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE CHIMNEY ON THE ROOF THEY HAD SUSTAINED NO OTHER DAMAGE HOWEVER THAN THAT OF SCRATCHING NEARLY ALL THE SKIN OFF THEIR HANDS THAT NIGHT THENARDIER WAS WARNED WITHOUT ANY ONE
TOLERABLY VAST CAGES SEPARATED BY NARROW PASSAGES BUILT OF MASONRY TO ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF THE ELBOW AND THE REST UP TO THE ROOF OF IRON BARS THENARDIER HAD BEEN IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
WHICH SHALL BE IN ACCORD WITH THE OLD WORLD WITHOUT TOO MUCH DISACCORD WITH THE NEW REVOLUTIONARY IDEAL A SITUATION IN WHICH IT BECAME NECESSARY TO USE LAFAYETTE TO DEFEND POLIGNAC
WHICH GAINED BUT LITTLE ACCEPTANCE OUTSIDE OF FRANCE BY KINGS HAD BEEN DIVERSELY INTERPRETED IN FRANCE AS WE HAVE SAID GOD DELIVERS OVER TO MEN HIS VISIBLE WILL IN EVENTS AN OBSCURE TEXT WRITTEN IN A MYSTERIOUS TONGUE
MOREOVER IF WE DEDUCT THE PUBLIC DUTIES WHICH REQUIRE TO BE FULFILLED FIRST OF ALL THAT DEEP TENDERNESS OF LOUIS PHILIPPE TOWARDS HIS FAMILY WAS DESERVED BY THE FAMILY THAT DOMESTIC GROUP WAS WORTHY OF ADMIRATION
THE AUSTERE AND ILLUSTRIOUS HISTORIAN LOUIS BLANC HAS HIMSELF RECENTLY SOFTENED HIS FIRST VERDICT
PRACTICAL MEN FELT THE NECESSITY OF A QUASI LEGITIMATE GUILLOTINE AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE VICTORIES OF CASIMIR PERIER WHO REPRESENTED THE NARROW SIDES OF THE BOURGEOISIE OVER LOUIS PHILIPPE WHO REPRESENTED ITS LIBERAL SIDES
AND WHICH THE BAND OF THE ENDORMEURS OR SLEEP COMPELLERS RENDERED FAMOUS THERE ARE IN MANY PRISONS TREACHEROUS EMPLOYEES HALF JAILERS HALF THIEVES WHO ASSIST IN ESCAPES
PROMPT AND PENETRATING GOOD SENSE PRACTICAL WISDOM EASY SPEECH PRODIGIOUS MEMORY DRAWING INCESSANTLY ON THIS MEMORY HIS ONLY POINT OF RESEMBLANCE WITH CAESAR ALEXANDER AND NAPOLEON
AN ESCAPE HAD BEEN PLANNED
THE MOST PROFOUND DECIPHER SLOWLY AND WHEN THEY ARRIVE WITH THEIR TEXT THE TASK HAS LONG BEEN COMPLETED THERE ARE ALREADY TWENTY TRANSLATIONS ON THE PUBLIC PLACE FROM EACH REMAINING SPRINGS A PARTY
BORN YESTERDAY IT WAS OBLIGED TO FIGHT TO DAY HARDLY INSTALLED IT WAS ALREADY EVERYWHERE CONSCIOUS OF VAGUE MOVEMENTS OF TRACTION ON THE APPARATUS OF JULY SO RECENTLY LAID AND SO LACKING IN SOLIDITY
ALWAYS MUZZLED BUT ALWAYS GROWLING WAS BORN ARMED PEACE
BUT PROFOUND MANNER IMPASSIVE MINERS WHO TRANQUILLY PUSHED THEIR GALLERIES INTO THE DEPTHS OF A VOLCANO HARDLY DISTURBED BY THE DULL COMMOTION AND THE FURNACES OF WHICH THEY CAUGHT GLIMPSES
THERE WAS LESS SPITE IN ITS WASH LESS FURY IN ITS BLOW THE MULTITUDINOUS ROARING OF THE HEAVING BLACKNESS HAD SOBERED INTO A HARD AND SULLEN GROWLING A SOUND AS OF THUNDER AMONG MOUNTAINS HEARD IN A VALLEY
REASSERTED ITSELF AND MAYBE I ALSO GOT SOME SLENDER COMFORT FROM OBSERVING THAT DULL AND HEAVY AS WAS THE MOTION OF THE BRIG THERE WAS YET THE BUOYANCY OF VITALITY IN HER MANNER OF MOUNTING THE SEAS AND THAT AFTER ALL
I SWALLOWED HALF A PANNIKIN OF THE HOLLANDS FOR THE SAKE OF THE WARMTH AND LIFE OF THE DRAUGHT AND ENTERING MY CABIN PUT ON THICK DRY STOCKINGS FIRST CHAFING MY FEET TILL I FELT THE BLOOD IN THEM
WITH A FACE OMINOUSLY WRETCHED AS WELL AS UGLY I INSTANTLY THOUGHT OF CRISTEL IF YOU BRING ME BAD NEWS I SAID DON'T KEEP ME WAITING FOR IT IT'S NOTHING THAT NEED TROUBLE YOU SIR
I WAS DRESSED BY THIS TIME AND SO EAGER TO GET TO THE COTTAGE THAT I HAD ALREADY OPENED MY DOOR WHAT I HAD JUST HEARD BROUGHT ME BACK INTO THE ROOM AS A MATTER OF COURSE WE BOTH SUSPECTED THE SAME PERSON OF STEALING THE OARS
WHAT HAS COME TO PASS IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL MY COMPANIONS HAVE BEEN WASHED OVERBOARD CERTAINLY FIVE MEN AT LEAST WERE LIVING BEFORE WE FOULED THE ICE AND AGAIN I CRIED OUT IS THERE ANY ONE ALIVE
I TOOK DOWN THE LAMP TRIMMED IT AND WENT TO THE LAZARETTE HATCH AT THE AFTER END OF THE CABIN HERE WERE KEPT THE STORES FOR THE CREW
I HAD AT ONE TIME DURING THE BLACK HOURS STRUCK INTO A MOURNFUL CALCULATION AND RECKONED THAT THE BRIG WOULD FLOAT SOME TWO OR THREE HOURS AFTER SUNRISE
HEAVING VERY SLOWLY THOUGH YOU FELT THE WEIGHT OF THE MIGHTY OCEAN IN EVERY FOLD AND EASTWARDS THE SHOULDERS OF THE SWELL CATCHING THE GLORIOUS REFLECTION OF THE SUN HURLED THE SPLENDOUR ALONG
WHAT DID HE DO FLEW INTO A FURIOUS RAGE I DON'T COMPLAIN OF THAT I DARESAY I DESERVED IT PLEASE TO EXCUSE MY GETTING UP AGAIN I CAN'T LOOK YOU IN THE FACE AND TELL YOU OF IT HE WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW
NEVERTHELESS HER CONTINUING TO FLOAT IN HER MISERABLY TORN AND MANGLED CONDITION WAS SO GREAT A MIRACLE THAT SPITE OF MY POOR SHIPMATES HAVING PERISHED AND MY OWN STATE BEING AS HOPELESS AS THE SKY WAS STARLESS
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ANOTHER TON OF WATER WOULD SINK HER AND IF THE SWELL FELL OVER HER BOWS AND FILLED THE DECKS DOWN SHE WOULD GO I HAD A SMALL PARCEL OF GUINEAS IN MY CHEST AND WAS ABOUT TO FETCH THIS MONEY
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT DRINK THE WHOLE CONTENTS OF THE JUG YOU FORGET SIR THAT I HAD SEEN THE DOG REVIVED BY TWO DOSES GIVEN WITH A SPACE OF TIME BETWEEN THEM
WHILE THE DEAF MAN LODGES AT THE COTTAGE HE MEANS MISCHIEF AND HIS EYE IS ON MISS CRISTEL EARLY THIS MORNING SIR I HAPPENED TO BE AT THE BOAT HOUSE SOMEBODY I LEAVE YOU TO GUESS WHO IT IS HAS STOLEN THE OARS
WE WILL WAIT A LITTLE BEFORE WE TALK OF SETTING THE LAW IN FORCE I SAID IN THE MEANTIME GLOODY I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD TELL THE MAGISTRATE IF I CALLED YOU AS A WITNESS HE CONSIDERED A LITTLE
THE BOAT WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET LONG
AND EVEN HAD I MANAGED THIS SHE STOOD TO BE SWAMPED AND I TO BE DROWNED
A LAPSE OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FOLLOWED THE LAST DOSE WAS REPEATED AND THE DOG SOON SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN AS LIVELY AS EVER GLOODY WAS THEREUPON TOLD TO SET THE ANIMAL FREE AND WAS INFORMED AT THE SAME TIME
THE FRESH MORNING AIR FLOWING THROUGH MY OPEN WINDOW COOLED AND COMPOSED ME THE MERCY OF SLEEP FOUND ME WHEN I WOKE AND LOOKED AT MY WATCH I WAS A NEW MAN THE HOUR WAS NOON I RANG MY BELL
HAD WE ANY PROOF TO JUSTIFY US GLOODY AT ONCE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE HAD NO PROOF I HAPPENED TO LOOK AT THE BOAT HE SAID AND I MISSED THE OARS OH YES I SEARCHED THE BOAT HOUSE NO OARS NO OARS
IS THERE ANYTHING MORE I ASKED THAT I OUGHT TO KNOW ONLY ONE THING MISTER ROYLAKE THAT I CAN THINK OF GLOODY REPLIED I'M AFRAID IT'S MISS CRISTEL'S TURN NEXT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHEN SHE SHOULD BE LAUNCHED AND LYING ALONGSIDE RAN HER MIDWAY OUT BY THE TACKLE AND ATTACHING A LINE TO A RING BOLT IN HER BOW SHOVED HER OVER THE SIDE AND SHE FELL WITH A SPLASH SHIPPING SCARCE A HATFUL OF WATER
IT WAS BORNE IN ON MY MIND SIR AND THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU HE SAID I DIDN'T DARE SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED ME OR IF YOU DID BELIEVE ME YOU MIGHT HAVE SENT FOR THE POLICE
IT WAS WONDERFUL HOWEVER THAT SHE SHOULD STILL BE AFLOAT NO MAN COULD HAVE HEARD THE RENDING AND GRATING OF HER SIDE AGAINST THE ICE WITHOUT SUPPOSING THAT EVERY PLANK IN IT WAS BEING TORN OUT
IT WAS THE SAILOR THAT HAD LAIN DROWNED ON THE STARBOARD SIDE OF THE FORWARD DECK BEING FROZEN STIFF HE ROSE IN THE POSTURE IN WHICH HE HAD EXPIRED THAT IS WITH HIS ARMS EXTENDED
MISERY AND HORROR WERE WITHIN THAT SHADOW AND BEYOND IT NOTHING THAT MY SPIRIT COULD LOOK UP TO I STOOD FOR SOME MOMENTS AS ONE STUNNED AND THEN MY MANHOOD TRAINED TO SOME PURPOSE BY THE USAGE OF THE SEA
FINDING THAT I HAD THE USE OF MY VOICE I HOLLOAED AS LOUDLY AS I COULD BUT NO HUMAN NOTE RESPONDED THREE OR FOUR TIMES I SHOUTED GIVING SOME OF THE PEOPLE THEIR NAMES BUT IN VAIN FATHER OF MERCY I THOUGHT
THE CUR HAD BETRAYED HIMSELF IT WAS A PALTRY VENGEANCE I OWN TO GRATIFY A MALICIOUS PLEASURE AS I DID NOW IN THINKING OF HIM AND SPEAKING OF HIM BY THE DEGRADING NAME WHICH HIS MORBID HUMILITY HAD SUGGESTED
AND I THEN WITH A SEAMAN'S DISPATCH SHIFTED THE REST OF MY APPAREL AND CANNOT EXPRESS HOW GREATLY I WAS COMFORTED BY THE CHANGE THOUGH THE JACKET AND TROUSERS I PUT ON WERE STILL DAMP WITH THE SOAKING OF PREVIOUS DAYS
THE ONE WAY OF PUTTING A STOP TO MURDERING MISCHIEF IF MURDERING MISCHIEF IT MIGHT BE WAS TO TRUST MISS CRISTEL THAT SHE WAS FOND OF YOU I DON'T MEAN ANY OFFENCE SIR I PRETTY WELL GUESSED
ONE EXTRAORDINARY STROKE I QUICKLY DETECTED THE JOLLY BOAT HAD LAIN STOWED IN THE LONG BOAT IT WAS THUS WE CARRIED THOSE BOATS THE LITTLE ONE LYING SNUGLY ENOUGH IN THE OTHER THE SEA THAT HAD FLOODED OUR DECKS
AND A DEEP OF ROLLING SAPPHIRE I STARTED WITH SUDDEN TERROR TO OBSERVE HOW CLOSE THE COVERING BOARD SAT UPON THE WATER AND HOW THE HEAD OF EVERY SWELL RAN PAST AS HIGH AS THE BULWARK RAIL
I THREW THE OAR OVER THE STERN OF THE BOAT TO KEEP HER NEAR TO THE BRIG NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE I DESIRED TO SEE THE LAST OF HER
IN THIS DIFFICULTY HE CAME BACK TO MY BEDSIDE LOOK HERE SIR WHAT I SAY IS THAT KICK HAS WIPED OUT THE DEBT OF THANKS I OWE HIM YES I SAY THE ACCOUNT BETWEEN US TWO IS SETTLED NOW ON BOTH SIDES
AND SUCH WAS THE STATE OF MY MIND THAT IMAGINATION MIGHT QUICKLY HAVE WORKED THE APPARITION HAD IT LINGERED INTO AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE UNSETTLING OF MY REASON I ROSE FROM THE SEAT ON TO WHICH I HAD SUNK AND LOOSED THE SAIL
TO JUDGE BY THE SOUND OF THE QUANTITY OF WATER IN THE VESSEL THAT SHE WAS FILLING I KNEW WELL YET NOT LEAKING SO RAPIDLY BUT THAT HAD OUR CREW BEEN PRESERVED WE MIGHT EASILY HAVE KEPT HER FREE
BUT I MET WITH AN OAR THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE OTHER BOAT AND THIS WITH THE MAST AND SAIL I DROPPED INTO HER THE SWELL LIFTING HER UP TO MY HAND WHEN THE BLUE FOLD SWUNG PAST MY NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO VICTUAL HER
BUT HIS RESOLUTION TO DO ME GOOD SERVICE IN RETURN FOR MY KINDNESS TO HIM FAR FROM BEING SHAKEN WAS CONFIRMED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN HIS MASTER RETURNED TO THE CHEMICAL STUDIES WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED
TILL ALL THAT QUARTER OF THE SEA LOOKED TO BE A MASS OF LEAPING DAZZLE UPON THE EASTERN SEA LINE LAY A RANGE OF WHITE CLOUDS COMPACT AS THE CHALK CLIFFS OF DOVER
WAS SURVEYING WITH THE COLD CURIOSITY OF AN INTELLIGENCE EMPTY OF HUMAN EMOTION THE DESTRUCTION OF ONE OF THOSE FABRICS WHOSE UNEQUAL CONTESTS AND REPEATED TRIUMPHS HAD PROVOKED ITS HAUGHTY SURPRISE
THE HEAVY SLUGGISH SODDEN MOVEMENT OF THE HULL ADVISED ME TO MAKE HASTE SHE WAS NOW BARELY LIFTING TO THE SWELL THAT CAME BRIMMING IN BROAD LIQUID BLUE BROWS TO HER STEM
I AM PERSUADED MY HEART MUST HAVE BROKEN AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE DIED OF GRIEF FAINTLY AS THE WIND BLEW IT SPEEDILY WAFTED ME OUT OF SIGHT OF THE FLOATING RELICS OF THE WRECK
AND HAULING THE SHEET AFT PUT THE OAR OVER THE STERN AND BROUGHT THE LITTLE CRAFT'S HEAD TO AN EASTERLY COURSE THE DRAUGHT OF AIR WAS EXTREMELY WEAK AND SCARCE FURNISHED IMPULSE ENOUGH TO THE SAIL TO RAISE A BUBBLE ALONGSIDE
EIGHT OR TEN BISCUITS SOME CANDLES A TINDER BOX SEVERAL LEMONS A LITTLE BAG OF FLOWER AND THIRTEEN BOTTLES OF BEER THESE THINGS I ROLLED UP IN A CLOTH AND PLACED THEM IN THE BOAT
WHEN A SORT OF STAGGERING SENSATION IN THE UPWARD SLIDE OF THE HULL GAVE ME A FRIGHT AND WATCHING MY CHANCE I JUMPED INTO THE BOAT AND CAST THE LINE THAT HELD HER ADRIFT THE SUN WAS AN HOUR ABOVE THE HORIZON
MY EYES DIRECTLY SOUGHT IT AND FOUND THE TIME TWENTY MINUTES AFTER TEN THIS SIGNIFIED THAT I HAD TEN OR ELEVEN HOURS OF DARKNESS BEFORE ME
SHOT WITH PEARLY LUSTRE FLOATED OVERHEAD VERY HIGH IT WAS IN TRUTH A FAIR AND PLEASANT MORNING OF AN ICY COLDNESS INDEED BUT THE AIR BEING DRY ITS SHREWDNESS WAS ENDURABLE
BY PREVENTING THE SEAS WHICH WASHED ON TO THE FORECASTLE FROM CASCADING WITH THEIR FORMER VIOLENCE AFT ALSO THAT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE MAIN AND TOP MASTS LAY UPON THE LARBOARD RAIL AND OVER THE SIDE
A MAN WHO CAN CHANGE HIS COMPLEXION AT WILL IS A MAN WE HAV'N'T HEARD OF YET MISTER ROYLAKE I HAD BEEN DRESSING FOR SOME TIME PAST LONGING TO SEE CRISTEL IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY
I RAN TO THE CABIN BUT THE LAZARETTE WAS FULL OF WATER AND NONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN IT TO BE COME AT I THEREUPON RANSACKED THE CABIN AND FOUND A WHOLE DUTCH CHEESE A PIECE OF RAW PORK HALF A HAM
BUT NO FEATURE OF MY LAMENTABLE SITUATION SO AFFRIGHTED ME SO WORKED UPON THE PASSIONS OF MY MIND AS MY LONELINESS OH FOR ONE COMPANION
BUT ONE LIVING THING THERE WAS BESIDES MYSELF A GREY BREASTED ALBATROSS OF A PRINCELY WIDTH OF PINION I HAD NOT OBSERVED IT TILL THE HULL WENT DOWN AND THEN
I CROSSED TO THE STARBOARD SIDE WHERE THE DECK WAS COMPARATIVELY CLEAR AND FOUND THE BODY OF A SEAMAN NAMED ABRAHAM WISE NEAR THE FORE HATCH
THAT NO EXECUTIONER COULD HAVE GONE MORE ARTISTICALLY TO WORK TO PINION AND CHOKE A MAN UNDER A MASS OF RIGGING IN THE LARBOARD SCUPPERS LAY TWO BODIES AS I COULD JUST FAINTLY DISCERN
AND HER MAIN DECK BLEW UP WITH A LOUD CLAP OR BLAST OF NOISE I COULD FOLLOW THE LINE OF HER BULWARKS FLUCTUATING AND WAVING IN THE CLEAR DARK BLUE WHEN SHE WAS SOME FEET UNDER
I HAD NOTICED THE JOLLY BOAT BOTTOM UP NEAR THE STARBOARD GANGWAY AND SO FAR AS I COULD MAKE OUT BY THROWING THE DULL LANTERN LIGHT UPON HER SHE WAS SOUND BUT I COULD NOT HAVE LAUNCHED HER WITHOUT SEEING WHAT I WAS DOING
IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SPIRIT OF THE DEEP HAD TAKEN FORM IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NOBLEST OF ALL THE FOWLS OF ITS DOMINIONS AND POISED ON TREMORLESS WINGS
AND NOTHING MORE THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN AND OUGHT TO TELL ME NOTHING SIR
THE BIRD QUITTED THE SPOT OF THE WRECK AFTER A WHILE AND FOLLOWED ME ITS EYES HAD THE SPARKLING BLOOD RED GLEAM OF RUBIES
I COULD HEAR A HUNDRED HARSH AND MELANCHOLY GROANING AND STRAINING SOUNDS RISING FROM THE HULL WITH NOW AND AGAIN A MIGHTY BLOW AS FROM SOME SPAR OR LUMP OF ICE ALONGSIDE WEIGHTY ENOUGH YOU WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED TO STAVE THE SHIP
WITH US HAD IT DAWNED YESTERDAY INSTEAD OF TO DAY MY COMPANIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALIVE AND YONDER SINKING RUINED FABRIC A TRIM SHIP CAPABLE OF BEARING US STOUTLY INTO WARM SEAS AND TO OUR HOMES AT LAST
THE SERVANT ANNOUNCED THAT A MAN WAS WAITING TO SEE ME THE SAME MAN SIR WHO WAS FOUND IN THE GARDEN LOOKING AT YOUR FLOWERS I AT ONCE GAVE DIRECTIONS TO HAVE HIM SHOWN UP INTO MY BEDROOM
I UNDERSTOOD THAT MY ONLY HOPE OF DELIVERANCE LAY IN BEING PICKED UP AND THAT THOUGH BY HEADING EAST I SHOULD BE CLINGING TO THE STORMY PARTS I WAS MORE LIKELY TO MEET WITH A SHIP HEREABOUTS
THE DELAY OF DRESSING WAS MORE THAN I HAD PATIENCE TO ENCOUNTER UNLESS I WAS COMPLETELY MISTAKEN HERE WAS THE VERY PERSON WHOM I WANTED TO ENLIGHTEN ME GLOODY SHOWED HIMSELF AT THE DOOR
YET FOR A FEW MOMENTS I STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE SCENE OF RUIN IT WAS VISIBLE NOW TO ITS MOST TRIFLING DETAIL THE FOREMAST WAS GONE SMOOTH OFF AT THE DECK IT LAY OVER THE STARBOARD BOW
WHERE PERCHANCE I MIGHT MEET A WHALER OR A SOUTHSEAMAN FROM NEW HOLLAND BUT MY HEART SANK AT THE PROSPECT OF THE LEAGUES OF WATER WHICH ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND THE ISLANDS AND THE WESTERN AMERICAN SEABOARD INDEED
THE INVESTIGATION THAT FOLLOWED WAS FAR TOO LONG AND TOO WEARISOME TO BE RELATED HERE IF I GIVE THE SUBSTANCE OF IT I SHALL HAVE DONE ENOUGH SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS AWAKE AND SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS ALONE SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP AND DREAMING
THE BRIG PITCHED AND ROLLED HEAVILY MUCH OF THE BUOYANCY OF HER EARLIER DANCE WAS GONE OUT OF HER NEVERTHELESS I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THIS SLUGGISHNESS WAS ALTOGETHER DUE TO THE WATER SHE HAD TAKEN IN
THAT SHE WAS TRUE AS STEEL AND NOT EASILY FRIGHTENED I DIDN'T NEED TO GUESS I KNEW IT GLOODY HAD DONE HIS BEST TO PREPARE CRISTEL FOR THE TERRIBLE CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAD DETERMINED TO REPOSE IN HER AND HAD NOT SUCCEEDED
AND THEN ALL WAS BARE BALD SWELLING SEA AND EMPEARLED SKY DARKENING IN LAGOONS OF AZURE DOWN TO THE SOFT MOUNTAINOUS MASSES OF WHITE VAPOUR LYING LIKE THE COAST OF A CONTINENT ON THE LARBOARD HORIZON
I'M DISMISSED FROM MY MASTER'S SERVICE THAT'S ALL IT WAS PLAINLY NOT ALL RELIEVED EVEN BY THAT GUARDED REPLY I POINTED TO A CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I MEAN WELL BY YOU I ASKED
I LAY FOR A LONG WHILE INSENSIBLE AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE RECOVERED MY MIND INSTEAD OF DYING IN THAT SWOON I MUST EVER ACCOUNT AS THE GREATEST WONDER OF A LIFE THAT HAS NOT BEEN WANTING IN THE MARVELLOUS
HAD FLOATED THE JOLLY BOAT OUT OF THE LONG BOAT AND SWEPT IT BOTTOM UP TO THE GANGWAY WHERE IT LAY AS THOUGH GOD'S MERCY DESIGNED IT SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR MY USE FOR NOT LONG AFTER IT HAD BEEN FLOATED OUT THE BRIG STRUCK THE BERG THE MASTS FELL
IT UTTERED A STRANGE SALT CRY THE VERY NOTE OF A GUST OF WIND SPLITTING UPON A ROPE FLAPPED ITS WINGS AND AFTER A TURN OR TWO
I TOOK FROM THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN A STOUT CLOAK AND THREW IT OVER ME ENVELOPING MY HEAD WHICH I HAD CASED IN A WARM FUR CAP WITH THE HOOD OF IT AND THUS EQUIPPED I LIGHTED A SMALL HAND LANTERN THAT WAS USED ON DARK NIGHTS FOR HEAVING THE LOG
AND WHICH SHE DRAGGED DOWN WITH HER ON A SUDDEN WHEN THE LAST FRAGMENT OF MAST HAD DISAPPEARED AND WHEN THE HOLLOWS OF THE WHIRLPOOLS WERE FLATTENING TO THE LEVEL SURFACE OF THE SEA UP ROSE A BODY WITH A SORT OF LEAP
MY CLOTHES WEIGHED UPON ME LIKE A SUIT OF ARMOUR SO INFLEXIBLY HARD WERE THEY FROZEN YET I GOT UPON MY LEGS AND FOUND THAT I COULD STAND AND WALK AND THAT LIFE FLOWED WARM IN MY VEINS
BUT I NOW NOTICED THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE HAMPER BEING ON THE LARBOARD SIDE BALANCED THE LIST THE VESSEL TOOK FROM HER SHIFTED BALLAST AND THAT SHE FLOATED ON A LEVEL KEEL WITH HER BOWS FAIR AT THE SEA
BUT THE MOTION OF THE BRIG CONTINUED VERY HEAVY A LARGE SWELL HAVING BEEN SET RUNNING BY THE LONG FIERCE GALE THAT WAS GONE AND THERE BEING NO UPROAR OF TEMPEST IN THE SKY TO CONFOUND THE SENSES
I MOVED WITH EXTREME CAUTION CASTING THE LANTERN LIGHT BEFORE ME SOMETIMES STARTING AT A SOUND THAT RESEMBLED A GROAN THEN STOPPING TO STEADY MYSELF DURING SOME PARTICULAR WILD LEAP OF THE HULL
NO LANGUAGE THAT I HAVE COMMAND OF COULD PUT BEFORE YOU THE HORROR THAT POSSESSED ME AS I SAT MEDITATING UPON MY SITUATION AND RECALLING THE FACES OF THE DEAD THE WIND WAS RAPIDLY FALLING AND WITH IT THE SEA
LIFTING MY EYES WITH INVOLUNTARY SYMPATHY IN THE DIRECTION POINTED TO BY THE UPRAISED ARMS OF THE SAILOR I OBSERVED THE GREAT ROYAL BIRD HANGING LIKE A SHAPE OF MARBLE DIRECTLY OVER THE FROTHING EDDIES
SO THAT WHEN HE JUMPED TO THE SURFACE HE CAME WITH HIS HANDS LIFTED UP TO HEAVEN AND THUS HE STAYED A MINUTE SUSTAINED BY THE EDDIES WHICH ALSO REVOLVED HIM THE SHOCK OCCASIONED BY THIS MELANCHOLY OBJECT WAS SO GREAT
AND THERE LAY THE LONG BOAT CRUSHED INTO STAVES THIS SIGNAL AND SURPRISING INTERVENTION FILLED MY HEART WITH THANKFULNESS THOUGH MY SPIRITS SANK AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF MY POOR DROWNED SHIPMATES
AND AS IF THAT HAD NOT SUFFICED TO SLAY HIM THE FALL OF THE MASTS HAD IN SOME WONDERFUL MANNER WHIPPED A ROPE SEVERAL TIMES ROUND HIS BODY BINDING HIS ARMS AND ENCIRCLING HIS THROAT SO TIGHTLY
NEVERTHELESS ITS RAYS SUFFERED ME TO GUESS AT THE PICTURE OF RUIN THE DECKS OFFERED THE MAIN MAST WAS SNAPPED THREE OR FOUR FEET ABOVE THE DECK AND THE STUMP OF IT SHOWED AS JAGGED AND BARBED AS A WILD BEAST'S TEETH
WHAT HIS MASTER HAD NO DOUBT INFERRED WAS WHAT I SAW PLAINLY TOO CRISTEL HAD SAVED MY LIFE AND HAD BEEN DIRECTED HOW TO DO IT BY THE POOR FELLOW WHO HAD SUFFERED IN MY CAUSE
AND SO MADE A TACKLE BY THE HELP OF WHICH I TURNED THE JOLLY BOAT OVER I THEN WITH A HANDSPIKE PRISED HER NOSE TO THE GANGWAY SECURED A BUNCH OF ROPE ON EITHER SIDE HER TO ACT AS FENDERS OR BUFFERS
EVEN ONE ONLY TO MAKE ME AN ECHO FOR MINE OWN SPEECH NAY GOD HIMSELF THE MERCIFUL FATHER OF ALL EVEN HE SEEMED NOT THE BLACKNESS LAY LIKE A PALL UPON THE DEEP AND UPON MY SOUL
GLOODY SETTLES THE ACCOUNT A NIGHT OF FEVER A NIGHT WHEN I DID SLUMBER FOR A FEW MINUTES OF HORRID DREAMS THIS WAS WHAT I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
UNTIL COMING ABREAST OF THE MAIN HATCH THE RAYS OF THE LANTERN STRUCK UPON A MAN'S BODY WHICH ON MY BRINGING THE FLAME TO HIS FACE PROVED TO BE CAPTAIN ROSY THERE WAS A WOUND OVER HIS RIGHT BROW
I HAD NO SOONER SAT UP THAN ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND MY PRESENT SITUATION INSTANTLY CAME TO ME MY HAIR WAS STIFF WITH ICE THERE WAS NO MORE FEELING IN MY HANDS THAN HAD THEY BEEN OF STONE
IT WAS DREADFUL I SAY TO BE THUS PLACED AND TO FEEL THAT I WAS IN THE HEART OF THE RUDEST MOST DESOLATE SPACE OF SEA IN THE WORLD INTO WHICH THE COMMERCE OF THE EARTH DISPATCHED BUT FEW SHIPS ALL THE YEAR ROUND
THAN BY SAILING INTO THE GREAT DESOLATION OF THE NORTH WEST THE BURDEN OF MY LONELINESS WEIGHED DOWN UPON ME SO CRUSHINGLY THAT I CANNOT BUT CONSIDER MY SENSES MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT DULLED BY SUFFERING
IT WAS AS SILENT AS A PHANTOM AND WITH ARCHED NECK AND MOTIONLESS PLUMES SEEMED TO WATCH ME WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT PRESENTLY GREW INSUFFERABLE SO FAR FROM FINDING ANY COMFORT OF COMPANIONSHIP IN THE CREATURE
INTO THOSE PRODIGIOUS LEAGUES OF OCEAN WHICH LAY STRETCHED UNDER THE SKY WHILST THE HULL FLOATED SHE WAS SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO SO TO SAY SOMETHING FOR THE EYE AMID THE VASTNESS OF WATER TO REST UPON
SHE WAS PLEDGED TO SECRECY UNDER PENALTY OF RUINING THE MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO SAVE ME AND TO HER PRESENCE OF MIND WAS TRUSTED THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF PRESERVING MY LIFE WHAT A SITUATION FOR A GIRL OF EIGHTEEN
WHATEVER SHE SAW HIM DRINK SHE WAS TO INSIST ON YOUR DRINKING IT TOO YOU HEARD ME ASK LEAVE TO MAKE THE TEA YES WELL THAT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNALS AGREED ON BETWEEN US
HER CASE MIGHT NOT BE SO DESPERATE AS WAS THREATENED BY THE WAY IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN TORN AND PRECIPITATED PAST THE ICEBERG AT MOMENTS WHEN SHE PLUNGED THE WHITENESS OF THE WATER CREAMING UPON THE SURGES ON EITHER HAND
GLOODY WAS EMPLOYED AS ASSISTANT TO THE EXTENT OF HIS LIMITED CAPACITY FOR MAKING HIMSELF USEFUL HE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT I WAS THE OBJECT OF ANY OF THE EXPERIMENTS UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE TEA PARTY
I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THIS AFTER WHAT HE HAD ALREADY TOLD ME MY INTELLIGENCE BRIGHTENED A LITTLE AS I WENT ON AND YOUR ACCIDENT IN THE NEXT ROOM WAS PLANNED OF COURSE I SAID
I SHOULD SAY NO JUDGING BY HIS LOOKS HE TURNED PALE WHEN HE FELT THE FLOOR SHAKEN BY YOUR FALL FOR ONCE IN A WAY HE WAS HONEST HONESTLY FRIGHTENED I NOTICED THE SAME THING SIR WHEN HE PICKED ME UP OFF THE FLOOR
MY LONELINESS WAS MORE TERRIBLE TO ME THAN ANY OTHER CONDITION OF MY SITUATION IT WAS DREADFUL TO BE STANDING NEARLY DEAD WITH COLD IN UTTER DARKNESS
IT WAS INTENSELY DARK THE BINNACLE LAMP WAS EXTINGUISHED AND THE LIGHT IN THE CABIN BURNED TOO DIMLY TO THROW THE FAINTEST COLOUR UPON THE HATCHWAY ONE THING I QUICKLY NOTICED THAT THE GALE HAD BROKEN AND BLEW NO MORE THAN A FRESH BREEZE
FOR THEY LAY UNDER A WHOLE BODY OF SHROUDS COMPLICATED BY A MASS OF OTHER GEAR AGAINST WHICH LEANED A PORTION OF THE CABOOSE I VIEWED THEM LONG ENOUGH TO SATISFY MY MIND THAT THEY WERE DEAD AND THEN WITH A HEART OF LEAD TURNED AWAY
THAT HE WOULD BE INSTANTLY DISMISSED IF HE MENTIONED TO ANY LIVING CREATURE WHAT HE HAD JUST SEEN BY WHAT PROCESS HE ARRIVED AT THE SUSPICION THAT MY SAFETY MIGHT BE THREATENED BY THE EXPERIMENT ON THE DOG HE WAS ENTIRELY UNABLE TO EXPLAIN
EVEN A POOR DEVIL LIKE ME DOES SOMETIMES FEEL IT WHEN HE IS INSULTED MISTER ROYLAKE HE KICKED ME SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT SIR I WOULD NEVER HAVE MENTIONED IT IF I HADN'T HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU ONLY I DON'T KNOW HOW
THERE WERE A FEW STARS DYING OUT IN THE DARK WEST THE ATMOSPHERE WAS CLEAR AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE I KNEW HE WOULD TURN THE SABLE PALL OVERHEAD INTO BLUENESS THE HULL LAY VERY DEEP
ERE I COULD HEAVE A CIVILIZED COAST OR A HABITABLE ISLAND INTO VIEW AT THE START I HAD A MIND TO STEER NORTH WEST AND BLOW AS THE WIND WOULD SUFFER INTO THE SOUTH SEA
TO GIVE HIM SOME IDEA OF THE JEALOUS HATRED WITH WHICH THE CUR REGARDED ME HE HAD DONE HIS BEST TO WARN ME WITHOUT ACTUALLY BETRAYING THE MAN WHO HAD RESCUED HIM FROM STARVATION OR THE WORKHOUSE AND HE HAD FAILED
THE MAGISTRATE WOULD PUT QUESTIONS TO ME WOULDN'T HE SIR VERY GOOD YOU PUT QUESTIONS TO ME AND I'LL ANSWER THEM TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
AND I HOPE YOU FOUND BENEFIT FROM THEM SAID MISS MILNER WITH GREAT KINDNESS AS SHE ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND WALKED SLOWLY OUT OF THE ROOM THOUGH MISS WOODLEY FOLLOWED HER SO THAT MISTER SANDFORD WAS LEFT ALONE WITH LORD ELMWOOD
AND THOUGH HE DID NOT SAY SO HE WAS AND LOOKED HIGHLY OFFENDED AT THIS JUNCTURE MISTER SANDFORD ENTERED ON BEHOLDING THE PRESENT PARTY IT REQUIRED NOT HIS SAGACITY TO SEE AT THE FIRST VIEW THAT THEY WERE ALL UNEASY
I AM UNDECEIVED NOW AND SHALL NEVER TAKE THAT LIBERTY AGAIN AS LORD ELMWOOD ALWAYS TREATED SANDFORD WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT HE BEGAN TO FEAR HE HAD BEEN DEFICIENT UPON THIS OCCASION AND THE DISPOSITION WHICH HAD INDUCED HIM TO TAKE HIS WARD'S PART
HAPPY AS MISS MILNER FOUND HERSELF IN HIS COMPANY SHE SAW HIM LEAVE THE ROOM WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION BECAUSE HER HEART WAS IMPATIENT TO GIVE A LOOSE TO ITS HOPES ON THE BOSOM OF MISS WOODLEY SHE BADE MISSUS HORTON IMMEDIATELY GOOD NIGHT AND IN HER FRIEND'S APARTMENT
ON WHAT PRETENCE TO ME IT WAS PREFERENCE OF A SINGLE LIFE BUT I SUSPECT IT IS WHAT HE IMAGINES TO BE LOVE
CONSTANTLY ON THE VERGE OF DISOBEYING MY COMMANDS THAT YOU MAY RECEDE AND GAIN MY GOOD WILL BY YOUR FORBEARANCE BUT KNOW MISTER SANDFORD THAT I WILL NOT SUFFER THIS MUCH LONGER IF YOU CHUSE IN EVERY CONVERSATION WE HAVE TOGETHER
THIS WAS BUT A COMMON PLACE CIVILITY SUCH AS IS PAID BY ONE ENEMY TO ANOTHER EVERY DAY BUT THE MANNER WAS THE MATERIAL PART THE UNAFFECTED CONCERN THE ATTENTION THE GOOD WILL SHE DEMONSTRATED IN THIS LITTLE INCIDENT
UPON THE SUBJECT OF THIS MARRIAGE SANDFORD MET HIS PATRON WITHOUT HAVING DETERMINED EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY BUT RESTED ON THE TEMPER IN WHICH HE SHOULD FIND HIM AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CONVERSATION HE SAID RUSHBROOK BEGGED FOR TIME
AND RUSHBROOK BY HIS ENTREATIES NOW GAINED THE INTELLIGENCE WHO THE NOBLEMAN WAS WHO ADDRESSED MATILDA AND ON WHAT VIEWS BUT WAS RESTRAINED TO PATIENCE BY SANDFORD'S ARGUMENTS AND THREATS
THIS WAS SO MUCH TO THE PURPOSE THAT MISS WOODLEY FOUND HERSELF ALARMED BUT WITHOUT REASON MISS MILNER LOVED TOO SINCERELY TO REVEAL IT TO THE OBJECT HE ANSWERED AND DID YOU KNOW SOME OF MINE YOU MIGHT THINK THEM EQUALLY UNPARDONABLE
WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM WAS A PRESENT FROM LADY LUNEHAM AND WOULD CERTAINLY CURE HIM AND SHE PRESSED IT UPON HIM WITH SUCH AN ANXIOUS EARNESTNESS THAT WITH ALL HIS CHURLISHNESS HE COULD NOT REFUSE TAKING IT
FOR SIR EDWARD AND LORD FREDERICK THUS AT ONCE DESTROYING ALL THOSE PLANS OF HAPPINESS WHICH POOR MISS MILNER HAD FORMED IN CONSEQUENCE HER MELANCHOLY HUMOUR WAS NOW PREDOMINANT SHE CONFINED HERSELF AT HOME AND YET BY HER OWN ORDER
TO SPEAK UPON A TOPIC WHERE IT IS PROBABLE I SHALL MEET WITH OPPOSITION YOU SANDFORD CAN REASON WITH MODERATION FOR AFTER ALL THAT I HAVE DONE FOR MY NEPHEW IT WOULD BE A PITY TO FORSAKE HIM AT LAST AND YET
BUT INSTEAD OF THE SYMPATHY THIS MIGHT HAVE EXCITED IN SOME DISPOSITIONS MISTER SANDFORD
WHERE THEIR OWN INCLINATIONS DO NOT FIRST POINT OUT THE CHOICE
IT IS THAT AND THAT ALONE WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF HER UNEASINESS HE SEEMED MORE AMAZED STILL AND STILL MORE SHOCKED AT HER DUPLICITY THAN AT HER TORTURE
DID YOU USE ALL THOSE DROPS MISS MILNER GAVE YOU FOR A PAIN IN THE HEAD YES ANSWERED HE I DID BUT THE QUESTION AT THAT MOMENT SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED HIM
I THINK I NEVER HEARD YOU MISTER SANDFORD COMPLAIN OF INDISPOSITION BEFORE WILL YOU ACCEPT OF MY SPECIFIC FOR THE HEAD ACHE INDEED IT IS A CERTAIN RELIEF I'LL FETCH IT INSTANTLY SHE WENT HASTILY OUT OF THE ROOM AND RETURNED WITH A BOTTLE
OR EVEN SUPPOSING HIS WISHES INCLINED TOWARDS HER THERE WERE YET GREAT OBSTACLES BETWEEN THEM WOULD NOT SANDFORD WHO DIRECTED HIS EVERY THOUGHT AND PURPOSE BE CONSULTED UPON THIS AND IF HE WAS UPON WHAT
AND AFTER SITTING SEVERAL MINUTES AND TALKING UPON INDIFFERENT SUBJECTS TO WHICH HIS WARD REPLIED WITH A DEJECTION IN HER VOICE AND MANNER HE SAID PERHAPS I AM WRONG MISS MILNER BUT I HAVE OBSERVED THAT YOU ARE LATELY MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN USUAL
WITHIN A YEAR MISTER SANDFORD WHO CAN TELL WHAT STRANGE EVENTS MAY NOT OCCUR TO CHANGE ALL OUR PROSPECTS EVEN MY PASSION MAY DECLINE IN THAT EXPECTATION THEN THE FAILURE OF WHICH YOURSELF MUST ANSWER FOR
WHEN THAT WHICH I PERHAPS WOULD SAY MIGHT OFFEND YOU TO HEAR TO WHAT AND WHITHER ARE YOU CHANGING OUR SUBJECT CRIED LORD ELMWOOD BUT SIR IF YOU KNOW MY RESENTFUL AND RELENTLESS TEMPER YOU SURELY KNOW HOW TO SHUN IT
YET THE FERVENT AND SOLEMN MANNER IN WHICH HE MADE IT CHEERED HER SPIRITS AND AS PERSONS ENJOY THE REFLECTION OF HAVING IN THEIR POSSESSION SOME VALUABLE GEM THOUGH THEY ARE DETERMINED NEVER TO USE IT SO SHE UPON THIS WAS COMFORTED AND GREW BETTER
BUT FROM HIS INDIFFERENCE TO ALL I HAVE SAID ON THE OCCASION I HAVE NOT YET MENTIONED HER NAME TO HIM YOU MAY I WILL MY LORD AND USE ALL MY PERSUASION TO ENGAGE HIS OBEDIENCE AND YOU SHALL HAVE AT LEAST A FAITHFUL ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE SAYS
THE INCLINATION HE MADE WITH HIS KNEES BENT TOWARDS THE GROUND STOPPED LORD ELMWOOD INSTANTLY BUT THOUGH IT BROKE IN UPON HIS WORDS IT DID NOT ALTER ONE ANGRY LOOK HIS EYES DARTED AND HIS LIPS TREMBLED WITH INDIGNATION
THOUGH HER'S WERE SOFTENED BY SORROW WHILE HIS WERE MADE AUSTERE BY THE SELF SAME CAUSE WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN SAID HIS UNCLE WITH A FROWN
BLESS ME MISTER SANDFORD ARE YOU NOT WELL YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE US SO EARLY HE REPLIED NO I HAVE A PAIN IN MY HEAD MISS MILNER WHO NEVER LISTENED TO COMPLAINTS WITHOUT SYMPATHY ROSE IMMEDIATELY FROM HER SEAT SAYING
AND MIGHT HAVE CONTINUED HIS UNKIND INSINUATIONS WITHOUT ONE RESTRAINT
I KNOW NOT WHETHER MY WEAK SENSES WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM SHE HAD HER EYES UPON HIM WHEN HE SPOKE THIS AND SHE DISCOVERED IN HIS THAT WERE FIXED UPON HER A SENSIBILITY UNEXPECTED A KIND OF FASCINATION WHICH ENTICED HER TO LOOK ON
THOUGH THE MOST REMOTE FROM SUCH A SUBJECT TO THINK OF MY DAUGHTER YOU MUST EITHER BANISH YOUR THOUGHTS OR CONCEAL THEM NOR BY ONE SIGN ONE ITEM REMIND ME OF HER YOUR DAUGHTER DID YOU CALL HER
THERE WAS YET THAT WHICH ENGAGED HIS ATTENTION BEYOND ANY CIRCUMSTANCE RELATING TO HIMSELF THE FEATURES OF LORD ELMWOOD OF WHICH HIS DAUGHTER'S WHOM HE HAD JUST BEHELD HAD THE MOST STRIKING RESEMBLANCE
YOU DO NOT MISTER SANDFORD LORD ELMWOOD REPLIED NO MY LORD NOR WOULD I WERE I IN YOUR SITUATION WHAT SHOULD MAKE A MAN OF SENSE OUT OF TEMPER BUT A WORTHY OBJECT AND HE LOOKED AT MISS MILNER
I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT HE RETURNED EAGERLY FOR IT IS MY EARNEST DESIRE TO HAVE YOU WITH ME YOUR WELFARE IS DEAR TO ME AS MY OWN AND WERE WE APART CONTINUAL APPREHENSIONS WOULD PREY UPON MY MIND
SHE COMPLAINED TO MISS WOODLEY WHO ADVISED HER TO HAVE PATIENCE BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE VIRTUES IN WHICH SHE WAS THE LEAST PRACTISED ENCOURAGED NEVERTHELESS BY HER FRIEND IN THE COMMENDABLE DESIRE OF GAINING THE AFFECTIONS OF HIM
AND NOW HAVING MADE A PREFACE TO EXCUSE YOU SHOULD YOU ONCE MORE REFUSE MINE I SHALL VENTURE TO GIVE IT MY LORD I HAVE NEVER YET REFUSED TO FOLLOW YOUR ADVICE BUT WHERE MY OWN PEACE OF MIND WAS SO NEARLY CONCERNED
NOT TO ACT AGAINST THE WILL OF HIS NEAREST RELATION AND FRIEND I MYSELF AM TOO HASTY CONTINUED LORD ELMWOOD AND UNHAPPILY TOO MUCH DETERMINED UPON WHAT I HAVE ONCE THOUGH PERHAPS RASHLY SAID
I SHOULD HOPE MISTER SANDFORD THAT YOU WOULD EXPRESS IT IN BETTER TERMS TELL ME THE TERMS AND I WILL BE EXACT RUSHBROOK STRUCK HIS FOREHEAD AND WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM AM I TO GIVE HIM ANY REASON FOR YOUR DISOBEYING HIM
AND ACT FOR THE BEST SO SHALL I HIS FRIENDS MY LORD WHAT FRIENDS OR WHAT FRIEND HAS HE UPON EARTH BUT YOU THEN WHY WILL HE NOT SUBMIT TO MY ADVICE OR HIMSELF GIVE ME A PROPER REASON WHY HE CANNOT
AS TO HAVE MADE ME CULPABLE HAD I COMPLIED WELL MADAM I SUBMIT TO YOUR DETERMINATIONS AND SHALL NEVER AGAIN OPPOSE YOUR INCLINATION TO REMAIN SINGLE THIS SENTENCE AS IT EXCLUDED THE IDEA OF SOLICITING FOR HIMSELF
GAVE WAY TO ALL THE LANGUAGE OF PASSION WARMED WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF MEETING ITS RETURN SHE DESCRIBED THE SENTIMENTS SHE HAD READ IN LORD ELMWOOD'S LOOKS AND THOUGH MISS WOODLEY HAD BEHELD THEM TOO
HE THANKED HER BUT ADDED WITH A SIGH IF I HAVE GIVEN UP CONTENT IN SEARCH OF JOY I SHALL PERHAPS BE A LOSER BY THE VENTURE SOON AFTER THIS HE WISHED THEM A GOOD NIGHT AND RETIRED
WAS LIKELY IN THE END TO PROVE UNFAVOURABLE TO HER FOR PERCEIVING SANDFORD WAS OFFENDED AT WHAT HAD PASSED AS THE ONLY MEANS OF RETRIBUTION HE BEGAN HIMSELF TO LAMENT HER VOLATILE AND CAPTIOUS
NAY SHE ANTICIPATED A DISAPPOINTMENT AS SHE HAD BEFORE ANTICIPATED HER SUCCESS BY TURNS FEELING THE KEENEST EMOTIONS FROM HOPE AND FROM DESPAIR AS THESE PASSIONS ALTERNATELY GOVERNED HER
WAS THAT WHICH MADE IT REMARKABLE AND IMMEDIATELY TOOK FROM LORD ELMWOOD THE DISPLEASURE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN JUST BEFORE PROVOKED OR RATHER TRANSFORMED IT INTO A DEGREE OF ADMIRATION EVEN SANDFORD WAS NOT INSENSIBLE TO HER BEHAVIOUR
BECAUSE THERE MAY BE FRIENDSHIP WITHOUT FAMILIARITY AND SO IT IS BETWEEN HIM AND YOU THAT CANNOT BE FOR I HAVE CONDESCENDED TO TALK TO HIM IN THE MOST FAMILIAR TERMS
HOW CAN I JUDGE IF SHE WILL NOT CONFIDE IN ME BUT THUS FOR EVER DECEIVE ME SHE LEANED PALE AS DEATH ON THE SHOULDER OF MISS WOODLEY HER EYE FIXED WITH APPARENT INSENSIBILITY TO ALL THAT WAS SAID WHILE HE CONTINUED
EVERY NECESSARY CEREMONY HAS TAKEN PLACE HERE THEN YOUR LORDSHIP IS NO LONGER IN ORDERS SAID MISS WOODLEY NO THEY HAVE BEEN RESIGNED THESE FIVE DAYS MY LORD I GIVE YOU JOY SAID MISS MILNER
BELIEVE ME MISS MILNER THAT IN THE MIDST OF YOUR GAYEST FOLLIES WHILE YOU THUS CONTINUE TO BLUSH I SHALL REVERENCE YOUR INTERNAL SENSATIONS OH MY LORD DID YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM I AM AFRAID YOU WOULD THINK THEM UNPARDONABLE
THE TEAR STARTED IN HER EYE AT THE EARNESTNESS THAT ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS HE SAW IT AND TO SOFTEN HER STILL MORE WITH THE SENSE OF HIS ESTEEM FOR HER HE INCREASED HIS EARNESTNESS WHILE HE SAID IF YOU WILL TAKE THE RESOLUTION TO QUIT LONDON
I TELL YOU AGAIN THAT I DARE NOT NAME THE CAUSE THEN WHY DO YOU SUBMIT TO A POWER YOU ARE ASHAMED TO OWN I AM NOT ASHAMED I GLORY IN IT ARE YOU ASHAMED OF YOUR ESTEEM FOR LADY MATILDA OH
HEAVEN IS MY WITNESS IF I KNEW IF I COULD CONCEIVE THE MEANS HOW TO MAKE HER HAPPY I WOULD SACRIFICE MY OWN HAPPINESS TO HERS MY LORD SAID MISS WOODLEY WITH A SMILE
WE HAVE ALL MUCH TO PARDON IN ONE ANOTHER AND I KNOW NOT WHETHER THE OFFICIOUS PERSON WHO FORCES EVEN HIS GOOD ADVICE IS NOT AS BLAMEABLE AS THE OBSTINATE ONE WHO WILL NOT LISTEN TO IT
AS TO WHAT YOU HAVE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT HAS MADE IMPRESSION ENOUGH ON MY MEMORY TO ENABLE ME TO REPEAT IT I AM GLAD IT HAS NOT AND MY ANSWER TO YOUR UNCLE IS TO BE SIMPLY THAT YOU WILL NOT OBEY HIM
OR RETIRING INTO THE COUNTRY SHE RETURNED HOME JUST AS THIS CONVERSATION WAS FINISHED AND SANDFORD THE MOMENT SHE ENTERED RANG FOR HIS CANDLE TO RETIRE MISS WOODLEY WHO HAD BEEN AT THE OPERA WITH MISS MILNER CRIED
IF YOU CANNOT RESOLVE ON WHAT YOU HAVE PROPOSED WHY DO YOU ASK THIS TIME OF YOUR UNCLE FOR SHOULD HE ALLOW IT YOU AT THE EXPIRATION YOUR DISOBEDIENCE TO HIS COMMANDS WILL BE LESS PARDONABLE THAN IT IS NOW
GAVE HER THE UTMOST PAIN AND HER EYE GLANCED AT HIM FULL OF REPROACH HE DID NOT OBSERVE IT BUT WENT ON WHILE YOU CONTINUE UNMARRIED IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN YOUR FATHER'S INTENTION THAT YOU SHOULD CONTINUE UNDER MY IMMEDIATE CARE
MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY SEEING HIS CONSTERNATION AND TREMBLING LEST HE SHOULD GUESS THE SECRET MY LORD MISS MILNER HAS AGAIN DECEIVED YOU YOU MUST NOT TAKE HER FROM LONDON
CALLED SANDFORD APART AND SAID TO HIM THAT AS THE MALEVOLENCE WHICH HE ONCE OBSERVED BETWEEN HIM AND RUSHBROOK HAD HE PERCEIVED SUBSIDED HE ADVISED HIM IF HE WAS A WELL WISHER TO THE YOUNG MAN TO SOUND HIS HEART AND COUNSEL HIM
BE THAT AS IT MAY LORD ELMWOOD COULD NOT BUT OBSERVE THIS CHANGE AND ONE MORNING THOUGHT FIT TO MENTION AND TO APPLAUD IT MISS WOODLEY AND SHE WERE AT WORK TOGETHER WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM
SHE FELT AND SHE EXPRESSED ANGUISH LORD ELMWOOD WAS ALARMED AND SHOCKED SHE DID NOT WEEP BUT SHE CALLED MISS WOODLEY TO COME TO HER WITH A VOICE THAT INDICATED A DEGREE OF AGONY
HE HAS NOT THEN ACTUALLY CONFESSED THIS TO YOU IF HE HAS IT WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY SUCH MEANS THAT I AM NOT WARRANTED TO SAY IT IN DIRECT WORDS I HAVE ENTERED INTO NO CONTRACT
IN THE VARIOUS CHANGES OF HIS COUNTENANCE FROM THE CONFLICT IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE WISHED TO SAY MORE THAN HE DARED ON WHICH LORD ELMWOOD CRIED SPEAK ON SANDFORD WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF OF YOU MY LORD HE STARTED
TO ENTERTAIN HOPES AND HE LOOKED AGAIN AT MISS MILNER DOES YOUR HEAD ACHE MISS MILNER ASKED HER FRIEND SEEING HER HOLD IT WITH HER HAND VERY MUCH RETURNED SHE MISTER SANDFORD SAID MISS WOODLEY
I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU SAID HE AND YOU CONTINUED SHE WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED ONLY TO CHURCH MUSIC WILL BE MORE THAN ANY ONE ENCHANTED WITH HEARING THE SOFTER MUSIC OF LOVE
SANDFORD WENT ON I KNOW NO TIE NO BOND NO INNOCENCE THAT IS A PROTECTION WHEN YOU FEEL RESENTMENT YOU ARE RIGHT HE REPLIED SIGNIFICANTLY THEN HOW MY LORD CAN YOU ENCOURAGE ME TO SPEAK ON
PROPENSITIES IN WHICH LAMENTATION SANDFORD NOW FORGETTING HIS AFFRONT JOINED WITH THE HEARTIEST CONCURRENCE ADDING YOU SIR HAVING NOW OTHER CARES TO EMPLOY YOUR THOUGHTS OUGHT TO INSIST UPON HER MARRYING
NOT A WORD I WISH HIM TO MARRY THAT I MAY THEN CONCLUDE THE DEEDS IN RESPECT TO MY ESTATE AND THE ONLY CHILD OF SIR WILLIAM WINTERTON A RICH HEIRESS WAS THE WIFE I MEANT TO PROPOSE
THERE ARE NO OBJECTS UNWORTHY OUR CARE REPLIED LORD ELMWOOD BUT THERE ARE OBJECTS ON WHOM ALL CARE IS FRUITLESS YOUR LORDSHIP WILL ALLOW I NEVER YET DESPAIRED OF ANY ONE MISTER SANDFORD AND YET THERE ARE PERSONS OF WHOM IT IS PRESUMPTION
IT WAS WITHOUT ANY MARKS EITHER OF SATISFACTION OR CONCERN MISS MILNER'S PRIDE BEGAN TO BE ALARMED WHILE HE WAS MISTER DORRIFORTH AND CONFINED TO A SINGLE LIFE
SHE WAS OFFENDED THAT CHOICE WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY FIXED UPON HER SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE THE DEVOTION OF EVERY MAN WHO SAW HER AND NOT TO OBTAIN IT OF THE MAN FROM WHOM OF ALL OTHERS SHE MOST WISHED IT WAS CRUELLY HUMILIATING
NOT AND SPEAK PLAINLY THEN DISSEMBLE NO I'LL NOT DO THAT BUT I'LL BE SILENT A NEW PARADE OF SUBMISSION YOU ARE MORE TORMENTING TO ME THAN ANY ONE I HAVE ABOUT ME
SHE NOW LIFTED UP HER HEAD AND LEANED IT ON HER HAND AS SHE SAT BY THE SIDE OF A TABLE STILL SHE DID NOT SPEAK BUT SEEMED OVERCOME WITH SORROW AS HER SITUATION BECAME HOWEVER LESS ALARMING
WHILE HER EYELIDS FELL INVOLUNTARILY BEFORE ITS MIGHTY FORCE AND A THOUSAND BLUSHES CROWDED OVER HER FACE HE WAS STRUCK WITH THESE SUDDEN SIGNALS HASTILY RECALLED HIS FORMER COUNTENANCE AND STOPPED THE CONVERSATION MISS WOODLEY
BUT THE MOST ROMANTIC AFFECTION ON THE PART OF LORD ELMWOOD HAD MISS MILNER TO DEPEND AND HIS LORDSHIP WAS NOT A MAN TO BE SUSPECTED OF SUBMITTING TO THE EXCESS OF ANY PASSION
THOUGH HE GUESSED A REASON I CANNOT GIVE TO LORD ELMWOOD THEN DO NOT GIVE IT TO ME FOR I HAVE PROMISED TO TELL HIM EVERY THING YOU SAY TO ME AND EVERY THING I HAVE SAID ASKED RUSHBROOK HASTILY
SHOULD NOT BE IN A SITUATION ABSOLUTELY CONTRARY TO MY WISHES I MAY PERHAPS CONFIRM HIS CHOICE THAT MOMENT SANDFORD'S COURAGE PROMPTED HIM TO NAME LADY MATILDA BUT HIS DISCRETION OPPOSED HOWEVER
THAT IS BUT TOO LIKELY IF HE PROVOKES ME SIR REPLIED SANDFORD I WILL SPEAK TO HIM YET ADDED LORD ELMWOOD STERNLY DO NOT URGE WHAT YOU SAY FOR MY SAKE BUT FOR HIS I CAN PART FROM HIM WITH EASE
PERHAPS I MAY CALL UPON YOU HEREAFTER TO FULFIL YOUR WORD HE WAS TOTALLY IGNORANT WHAT SHE MEANT NOR HAD HE LEISURE FROM THE CONFUSION OF HIS THOUGHTS TO REFLECT UPON HER MEANING HE NEVERTHELESS REPLIED WITH WARMTH DO
THEN COME SIR LET US BE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING THROUGH YOU AND NOW SPEAK OUT HIS THOUGHTS FREELY AND HEAR MINE IN RETURN
HEATED HIS DRESS AND HIS HAIR DISORDERED HE ENTERED THE DINING ROOM JUST AS THE DESSERT WAS PUT UPON THE TABLE HE WAS CONFOUNDED AT HIS OWN APPEARANCE AND AT THE FALSEHOODS HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO FABRICATE IN HIS EXCUSE
NO AGREEMENT ON HIS ACCOUNT WITH THE FRIENDS OF THE LADY I HAVE POINTED OUT SAID LORD ELMWOOD NOTHING BEYOND IMPLICATIONS HAVE PASSED BETWIXT HER FAMILY AND MYSELF AT PRESENT AND IF THE PERSON ON WHOM HE HAS FIXED HIS AFFECTIONS
IF SHE IS THE CAUSE OF YOUR DISOBEDIENCE BE ASSURED I SHALL NOT MENTION IT FOR I AM FORBID TO NAME HER AND SURELY AS THAT IS THE CASE I NEED NOT FEAR TO SPEAK PLAINLY TO YOU I LOVE LADY MATILDA OR PERHAPS UNACQUAINTED WITH LOVE
THIS WAS NOT THE WAY TO SECURE THE AFFECTIONS OF LORD ELMWOOD SHE KNEW IT WAS NOT AND BEFORE HIM SHE WAS UNDER SOME RESTRICTION SANDFORD OBSERVED THIS AND WITHOUT RESERVE ADDED TO THE LIST OF HER OTHER FAILINGS HYPOCRISY
YOUR LORDSHIP THEN THINKS ALL MY COMMENDABLE DEEDS ARISE FROM ACCIDENT AND THAT I HAVE NO VIRTUES OF MY OWN PARDON ME I THINK YOU HAVE MANY THIS HE SPOKE EMPHATICALLY AND HER BLUSHES INCREASED HE RESUMED
WAS DENIED TO ALL HER VISITORS WHETHER THIS AROSE FROM PURE MELANCHOLY OR THE STILL LINGERING HOPE OF MAKING HER CONQUEST BY THAT SEDATENESS OF MANNERS WHICH SHE KNEW HER GUARDIAN ADMIRED SHE HERSELF PERHAPS DID NOT PERFECTLY KNOW
FOR THE TIME I MENTION THERE SHALL BE NO MEANS OMITTED TO MAKE THE COUNTRY ALL YOU CAN WISH I SHALL INSIST UPON MISS WOODLEY'S COMPANY FOR BOTH OUR SAKES AND IT WILL NOT ONLY BE MY STUDY TO FORM
HE SAW HER COUNTENANCE CHANGE HE LOOKED AT HER STEADFASTLY IT WAS NOT A COMMON CHANGE FROM JOY TO SORROW FROM CONTENT TO UNEASINESS
ANOTHER GENTLEMAN OF FAMILY AND FORTUNE MADE OVERTURES TO MISS MILNER AND HER GUARDIAN SO FAR FROM HAVING HIS THOUGHTS INCLINED TOWARDS HER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT PLEADED THIS LOVER'S CAUSE EVEN WITH MORE ZEAL THAN HE HAD PLEADED
IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT MISTER SANDFORD ESTEEMED HER LESS AND LESS EVERY DAY AND AS HE WAS THE PERSON WHO MOST INFLUENCED THE OPINION OF HER GUARDIAN HE BECAME TO HER VERY SOON AN OBJECT NOT MERELY OF DISLIKE BUT OF ABHORRENCE
HEARD MISS MILNER IN YOUR ABSENCE UTTER A SYLLABLE TO YOUR DISADVANTAGE SHE DARES NOT MY LORD BECAUSE SHE IS IN FEAR OF YOU AND SHE KNOWS YOU WOULD NOT SUFFER IT
BUT TO THE MIND OF LORD ELMWOOD THE MERIT WAS INFINITE AND UPON THE DEPARTURE OF SANDFORD HE BEGAN TO BE UNUSUALLY CHEERFUL HE FIRST PLEASANTLY REPROACHED THE LADIES FOR NOT OFFERING HIM A PLACE IN THEIR BOX AT THE OPERA
AND IN RETURN WHEN HE LEFT THE ROOM WISHED HER A GOOD NIGHT TO HER AND MISS WOODLEY WHO HAD NOT BEEN WITNESSES OF THE PRECEDING CONVERSATION WHAT SHE HAD DONE APPEARED OF NO MERIT
SHE WAS ALTERNATELY IN SPIRITS OR DEJECTED IN GOOD OR IN ILL HUMOUR AND THE VICISSITUDES OF HER PROSPECT AT LENGTH GAVE TO HER BEHAVIOUR AN AIR OF CAPRICE WHICH NOT ALL HER FOLLIES HAD TILL NOW PRODUCED
AND SAW HIM LISTEN TO IT ALL AND HEARD HIM ANSWER WITH THE MOST TRANQUIL RESOLUTION THAT HE WOULD DO ANY THING TO PRESERVE THE FRIENDSHIP AND PATRONAGE OF HIS UNCLE BUT MARRY WHAT CAN BE YOUR REASON ASKED SANDFORD
WHO POSSESSED ALL HER OWN SHE HOWEVER LEFT NO MEANS UNATTEMPTED FOR THE CONQUEST BUT SHE BEGAN WITH TOO GREAT A CERTAINTY OF SUCCESS NOT TO BE SENSIBLE OF THE DEEPEST MORTIFICATION IN THE DISAPPOINTMENT
SHE TURNED PALE AND COULD NO LONGER GUIDE HER NEEDLE IN THE FOND TRANSPORT OF HER HEART SHE IMAGINED THAT HIS LOVE FOR HER WAS AMONG THE SENSATIONS TO WHICH HE ALLUDED SHE WAS TOO MUCH EMBARRASSED TO REPLY AND HE CONTINUED
SHE BLUSHED AS SHE ALWAYS DID WHEN THE SUBJECT WAS HERSELF HE CONTINUED YOUR HEALTH APPEARS PERFECTLY RESTORED AND YET I HAVE OBSERVED YOU TAKE NO DELIGHT IN YOUR FORMER AMUSEMENTS
AND I WAS GOING TO CONGRATULATE YOU UPON THE CHANGE BUT GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENQUIRE
BUT AS I MEAN FOR THE FUTURE TO RESIDE CHIEFLY IN THE COUNTRY ANSWER ME CANDIDLY DO YOU THINK YOU COULD BE HAPPY THERE FOR AT LEAST THREE PARTS OF THE YEAR AFTER A SHORT HESITATION SHE REPLIED I HAVE NO OBJECTION
HIS INDIFFERENCE TO HER CHARMS WAS RATHER AN HONOURABLE THAN A REPROACHFUL TRAIT IN HIS CHARACTER AND IN REALITY SHE ADMIRED HIM FOR THE INSENSIBILITY BUT ON THE EVE OF BEING AT LIBERTY AND ON THE EVE OF MAKING HIS CHOICE
BUT HE MAY THEN REPENT AND YOU KNOW REPENTANCE ALWAYS COMES TOO LATE WITH ME MY LORD I WILL EXERT ALL THE EFFORTS IN MY POWER FOR HIS WELFARE BUT WHAT IS THE SUBJECT ON WHICH HE HAS REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH YOUR DESIRES
SORROWFUL AND AFFECTING AS THIS INTERVIEW HAD BEEN RUSHBROOK AS HE RODE HOME REFLECTED UPON IT WITH THE MOST INORDINATE DELIGHT AND HAD HE NOT SEEN DECLINE OF HEALTH IN THE LOOKS AND BEHAVIOUR OF LADY MATILDA HIS FELICITY HAD BEEN UNBOUNDED
SUCH A SOCIETY AS YOU MAY APPROVE BUT I AM CERTAIN IT WILL BE LIKEWISE THE STUDY OF LADY ELMWOOD HE WAS GOING ON BUT AS IF A PONIARD HAD THRUST HER TO THE HEART
THE FOOL BLEST AS THE WISE THE SINCERITY WITH WHICH LORD ELMWOOD HAD LOVED WAS EXPRESSED MORE THAN IN WORDS AS HE SAID THIS YOUR LORDSHIP IS TALKING REPLIED SANDFORD OF THE PASSION IN ITS MOST REFINED AND PREDOMINANT SENSE
FOR I PITY YOU AND THAT SENSATION I WOULD GLADLY EXCHANGE FOR APPROBATION IF YOU REALLY FEEL COMPASSION FOR ME AND I BELIEVE YOU DO CONTRIVE SOME MEANS BY YOUR ANSWERS TO LORD ELMWOOD TO PACIFY HIM WITHOUT INVOLVING ME IN RUIN
AND USE ALL MY POWER TO RENDER MYSELF WORTHY OF THE UNION FOR WHICH HE DESIGNS ME AND THIS IS NOT ONLY YOUR SOLEMN PROMISE BUT YOUR FIXED DETERMINATION NAY WHY WILL YOU SEARCH MY HEART TO THE BOTTOM WHEN THE SURFACE OUGHT TO CONTENT YOU
YOU SHALL FIND I'LL PERFORM IT DO I WILL FAITHFULLY PERFORM IT THOUGH MISS MILNER WAS CONSCIOUS THIS DECLARATION COULD NOT IN DELICACY BE EVER ADDUCED AGAINST HIM
THERE IS ONE FAULT HOWEVER MISTER SANDFORD I CANNOT LAY TO HER CHARGE AND WHAT IS THAT MY LORD CRIED SANDFORD EAGERLY WHAT IS THAT ONE FAULT WHICH MISS MILNER HAS NOT I NEVER REPLIED LORD ELMWOOD
I HAVE GIVEN HIM TIME HAVE I NOT CRIED LORD ELMWOOD WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF HIS THUS TRIFLING WITH ME SANDFORD REPLIED MY LORD YOUNG MEN ARE FREQUENTLY ROMANTIC IN THEIR NOTIONS OF LOVE AND THINK IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A SINCERE AFFECTION
HINT AT MY AFFECTIONS BEING ENGAGED BUT NOT TO WHOM AND ADD THAT I HAVE GIVEN MY WORD IF HE WILL ALLOW ME A SHORT TIME A YEAR OR TWO ONLY I WILL DURING THAT PERIOD TRY TO DISENGAGE THEM
AT THIS TIME I WAS RECEIVING TWO DOLLARS A WEEK BESIDES MY BOARD THOSE WHO WERE EARNING MUCH MORE AND WERE CAREFULLY LAYING IT UP DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY HAPPIER THAN I WAS I NEVER THOUGHT THAT THE POSSESSION OF MONEY WOULD MAKE ME FEEL RICH
OR WHERE THE GORGEOUS EAST WITH RICHEST HAND SHOWERS ON HER KINGS BARBARIC PEARL AND GOLD WITHOUT SEEING ANGELINE'S KINDLY HOMELY FACE
OH DEAR OH DEAR WHAT SHALL WE DO IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO OH DEAR OH DEAR WHERE SHALL WE BE IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE OH DEAR OH DEAR WE SHALL BE NO MORE IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR
I THOUGHT IT BELONGED TO MY POETIC FRIEND THE BALER OF CLOTH BUT ONE DAY HE INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS A BORROWED BOOK HE THOUGHT HOWEVER HE SHOULD CLAIM IT FOR HIS OWN NOW THAT HE HAD KEPT IT SO LONG
AND WE HAD OUR FROLICS AMONG THE HEAPS OF CLOTH AS IF WE WERE BOTH CHILDREN
IT WAS AN EVENT TO ME AND TO MY IMMEDIATE FRIENDS AMONG THE MILL GIRLS WHEN THE POET WHITTIER CAME TO LOWELL TO STAY AWHILE
I REMEMBER ONE AN EDITOR AND AUTHOR FROM GEORGIA WHO VISITED OUR IMPROVEMENT CIRCLE AND WHO SENT SOME OF US OFFERING CONTRIBUTORS COPIES OF HIS BOOK AFTER HE HAD RETURNED HOME
ONE DAY TOWARDS THE LAST OF MY STAY AT LOWELL I NEVER CHANGED MY WORK ROOM AGAIN THIS SAME FRIENDLY FELLOW TOILER HANDED ME A POEM TO READ WHICH SOME ONE HAD SENT IN TO US FROM THE COUNTING ROOM WITH THE PENCILED COMMENT SINGULARLY BEAUTIFUL
IT IS A PITY THAT IT SHOULD BE UNFAMILIAR TO MODERN GIRLHOOD WARE'S ZENOBIA THE QUEEN OF PALMYRA WALKED AMONG US AND HELD A LOFTY PLACE AMONG OUR IDEALS OF HEROIC WOMANHOOD NEVER YET OBLITERATED FROM ADMIRING REMEMBRANCE
THE PROFESSOR HAD HIS OWN DISTINCTIVE NAME FOR EACH OF HIS PUPILS ELIZA WAS NAIVETE FROM HER ARTLESS MANNERS AND ME HE CALLED ETHERIA PROBABLY ON ACCOUNT OF MY STAR GAZING AND VERSE WRITING HABITS CERTAINLY THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING ETHEREAL IN MY VISIBLE PRESENCE
TIME IS MONEY BUT THAT WAS NOT MY THOUGHT ABOUT IT TIME IS EDUCATION I SAID TO MYSELF FOR THAT WAS WHAT I MEANT IT SHOULD BE TO ME PERHAPS I NEVER GAVE THE WAGE EARNING ELEMENT IN WORK ITS DUE WEIGHT
I HAD ALSO THE READING OF THE BIBLIOTHECA SACRA AND THE NEW ENGLANDER AND SOMETIMES OF THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW BY THE TIME I HAD COME DOWN TO WORDSWORTH AND COLERIDGE IN MY READINGS OF ENGLISH POETRY
OUT OF THE VERY ROUGHNESSES OF THE INTERVENING ROAD LIGHT HAD BEEN KINDLED WHICH MADE THE END OF THE SECOND TEN YEARS GLOW WITH ENTHUSIASTIC HOPE I HAD EARLY BEEN SAVED FROM A GREAT MISTAKE FOR IT IS
BY LIKE A RAY OF LIGHT THAT BRIGHTENED MY HOMELY LABOR THE WATER IS MAKING MY OWN HANDS WHITE WHILE I WASH THE ROBES OF MY NEIGHBOR AND HOW DELIGHTED WE WERE WITH MISSUS KIRKLAND'S A NEW HOME WHO'LL FOLLOW THE FIRST REAL WESTERN BOOK I EVER READ
BY MERIT RAISED TO THAT BAD EMINENCE SHE TOO WAS MUCH OLDER THAN I
ONE DAY IT WAS MATHER'S MAGNALIA WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY WITH A DESIRE TO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF NEW ENGLAND HE LOOKED A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL TURN MY MIND HAD TAKEN BUT HIS ONLY COMMENT WAS
IT WAS POE'S RAVEN WHICH HAD JUST MADE ITS FIRST APPEARANCE IN SOME MAGAZINE IT SEEMED LIKE AN APPARITION IN LITERATURE INDEED THE SENSATION IT CREATED AMONG THE STAID MEASURED LYRICS OF THAT DAY
BUT I DO NOT THINK WE LOWELL GIRLS HAD A VOLUME OF DOCTOR HOLMES'S POEMS AT THAT TIME THE LADY'S BOOK AND GRAHAM'S MAGAZINE WERE THEN THE POPULAR PERIODICALS AND THE MILL GIRLS TOOK THEM I REMEMBER THAT THE NUGGETS
HE SANG THE ERL KING IN HIS OWN TONGUE ADMIRABLY WE WENT THROUGH FOLLEN'S GERMAN GRAMMAR AND READER WHAT A CHOICE COLLECTION OF EXTRACTS THAT READER WAS WE CONQUERED THE DIFFICULT GUTTURALS LIKE THOSE IN THE NUMERAL ACHT UND ACHTZIG
WHEN I CAME BACK SHE WAS A GROWN UP YOUNG WOMAN MY FRIEND ANNA WHO HAD PROCURED FOR ME THE PLACE AND WORK BESIDE HER WHICH I LIKED SO MUCH WAS NOT AT ALL A BOOKISH PERSON BUT WE HAD PERHAPS A BETTER TIME TOGETHER THAN IF SHE HAD BEEN
IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT THE APOSTLE'S IDEA ABOUT WORLDLY POSSESSIONS WAS THE ONLY SENSIBLE ONE HAVING FOOD AND RAIMENT LET US BE THEREWITH CONTENT IF I COULD EARN ENOUGH TO FURNISH THAT AND HAVE TIME TO STUDY BESIDES
IN A FEW WEEKS I ANSWERED IT BUT THE RESPONSE WAS FROM ANOTHER PERSON A NEAR RELATIVE SHE WAS DEAD
A LIVING LOVING GROWING SPIRIT CAN NEVER BE OLD EMERSON SAYS SPRING STILL MAKES SPRING IN THE MIND WHEN SIXTY YEARS ARE TOLD
POPE WAS AN EXCEPTION HOWEVER APHORISMS FROM THE ESSAY ON MAN
EDWARD EVERETT JOHN PIERPONT AND RALPH WALDO EMERSON AMONG OUR LECTURERS WITH NUMEROUS DISTINGUISHED CLERGYMEN OF THE DAY DANIEL WEBSTER WAS ONCE IN THE CITY TRYING A LAW CASE SOME OF MY GIRL FRIENDS WENT TO THE COURT ROOM AND HAD A GLIMPSE OF HIS FACE
IT HAD TO BE WATCHED IN A DOZEN DIRECTIONS EVERY MINUTE AND EVEN THEN IT WAS ALWAYS GETTING ITSELF AND ME INTO TROUBLE I FELT AS IF THE HALF LIVE CREATURE WITH ITS GREAT GROANING JOINTS AND WHIZZING FAN WAS AWARE OF MY INCAPACITY TO MANAGE IT AND HAD A FIENDISH SPITE AGAINST ME
WITH A SCORN IN HER EYE THAT THE GAZER COULD FEEL AND A GLANCE LIKE THE SUNSHINE THAT FLASHES ON STEEL GO BACK HAUGHTY SOUTHRON GO BACK FOR THY GOLD IS RED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE HEARTS THOU HAST SOLD
OUR ATTITUDE THE ATTITUDE OF THE TIME WAS THAT OF CHILDREN CLIMBING THEIR DOORYARD FENCE TO WATCH AN APPROACHING SHOW AND TO CONJECTURE WHAT MORE REMARKABLE SPECTACLE COULD BE FOLLOWING BEHIND
WE READ BOOKS ALSO THAT BORE DIRECTLY UPON THE CONDITION OF HUMANITY IN OUR TIME THE GLORY AND SHAME OF ENGLAND WAS ONE OF THEM AND IT STIRRED US WITH A WONDERFUL AND PAINFUL INTEREST WE FOLLOWED TRAVELERS AND EXPLORERS LAYARD TO NINEVEH
WE HAD OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES INTO HIS OWN WELL ORDERED HOME LIFE AT SOCIAL GATHERINGS
BUT THE TRADITIONARY STERNNESS OF THESE WAS MUCH MODIFIED EVEN IN THE CHILDHOOD OF THE GENERATION TO WHICH I BELONG
BUT ONE EVENING WHEN WE ASSEMBLED AT THE IMPROVEMENT CIRCLE HE WAS THERE THE OFFERING EDITOR MISS HARRIET FARLEY HAD LIVED IN THE SAME TOWN WITH HIM AND THEY WERE OLD ACQUAINTANCES IT WAS A WARM SUMMER EVENING
THEN O FATHER THOU ALONE FROM THE SHADOW OF THY THRONE TO THE SIGHING OF MY BREAST AND ITS RAPTURE ANSWEREST I GREW SO FAMILIAR WITH THIS VOLUME THAT I FELT ACQUAINTED WITH THE POET LONG BEFORE I MET HIM IT REMAINED IN MY DESK DRAWER FOR MONTHS
I WONDER IF SHE REMEMBERS HOW HARD WE TRIED TO GET BEELZEBUB THAN WHOM
WHEN A CHILD I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT ALMOST AS MUCH OF A DISGRACE TO SPELL A WORD WRONG
THE ONLY MACHINERY IN THE ROOM WAS A HYDRAULIC ARRANGEMENT FOR PRESSING THE CLOTH INTO BALES MANAGED BY TWO OR THREE MEN ONE OF WHOM WAS QUITE A POET AND A FINE SINGER ALSO HIS HYMNS WERE FREQUENTLY IN REQUEST ON PUBLIC OCCASIONS
I RECALL THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT A NUMBER OF US WORE WHITE DRESSES ALSO THAT I SHRANK BACK INTO MYSELF AND FELT MUCH ABASHED WHEN SOME VERSES OF MINE WERE READ BY THE EDITOR WITH OTHERS SO MUCH BETTER HOWEVER THAT MINE RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION
AS IT HAD BEEN REPORTED TO HER MARGARET FOLEY WHO AFTERWARDS BECAME DISTINGUISHED AS A SCULPTOR WAS ONE OF THESE SHE DID NOT REMAIN MANY MONTHS AT HER OCCUPATION WHICH I THINK WAS WEAVING SOON CHANGING IT FOR THAT OF TEACHING AND STUDYING ART
THE GREATEST OF MISTAKES TO BEGIN LIFE WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT IS GOING TO BE EASY OR WITH THE WISH TO HAVE IT SO WHAT A WORLD IT WOULD BE IF THERE WERE NO HILLS TO CLIMB OUR POWERS WERE GIVEN US THAT WE MIGHT CONQUER OBSTACLES AND CLEAR OBSTRUCTIONS FROM THE OVERGROWN HUMAN PATH
OF COURSE WE ALWAYS GAVE AWAY A LITTLE HOWEVER LITTLE WE HAD IT SEEMED TO ME A
IT WAS PLEASURE RATHER THAN TOIL
NEW ENGLAND WOMANHOOD CROWNED WHITTIER AS HER LAUREATE FROM THE DAY OF HIS HEROINE'S SPIRITED RESPONSE TO THE SLAVEHOLDER O COULD YE HAVE SEEN HER THAT PRIDE OF OUR GIRLS ARISE AND CAST BACK THE DARK WEALTH OF HER CURLS
YET OUR MINISTERS APPRECIATED THE INTELLIGENCE AND PIETY OF THEIR FEMININE PARISHIONERS AN AGENT WHO CAME FROM THE WEST FOR SCHOOL TEACHERS WAS TOLD BY OUR OWN PASTOR THAT FIVE HUNDRED COULD EASILY BE FURNISHED FROM AMONG LOWELL MILL GIRLS
THE FASCINATION OF FESTUS WAS THAT OF WONDER DOUBT AND DISSENT WITH GREAT OUTBURSTS OF AN OVERMASTERING FAITH SWEEPING OVER OUR MINDS AS WE READ SOME OF OUR FRIENDS THOUGHT IT NOT QUITE SAFE READING BUT WE REMEMBER IT AS ONE OF THE INSPIRATIONS OF OUR WORKADAY YOUTH
A NESTORIAN BISHOP WALKING THROUGH THE FACTORY YARD IN HIS ORIENTAL ROBES WITH MORE THAN A CHILD'S WONDER ON HIS FACE AT THE STIR AND RUSH OF EVERYTHING HE CAME FROM BOSTON BY RAILROAD AND WAS PRESENT AT THE WEDDING AT THE CLERGYMAN'S HOUSE WHERE HE VISITED THE RAPIDITY OF THE SIMPLE CONGREGATIONAL SERVICE
AND I RETIRED FROM THE FIELD VANQUISHED THE TWO THINGS I HAD ENJOYED IN THIS ROOM WERE THAT MY SISTER WAS WITH ME AND THAT OUR WINDOWS LOOKED TOWARD THE WEST WHEN THE WORK WAS RUNNING SMOOTHLY WE LOOKED OUT TOGETHER AND QUOTED TO EACH OTHER ALL THE SUNSET POETRY WE COULD REMEMBER
QUOTING FROM THE POEM WHO CAN MISTAKE GREAT THOUGHTS SHE GAVE ME THE VOLUME AFTERWARDS WHEN WE WENT WEST TOGETHER
THIS LATTER OCCURRED IN MIDWINTER THE WHOLE HEAVENS WERE OF A DEEP ROSE COLOR ALMOST CRIMSON REDDEST AT THE ZENITH AND PALING AS IT RADIATED TOWARDS THE HORIZON THE SNOW WAS FRESH ON THE GROUND AND THAT TOO WAS OF A BRILLIANT RED
WHERE THE CLOTH WAS FOLDED STAMPED AND BALED FOR THE MARKET THERE WERE ONLY HALF A DOZEN GIRLS OF US WHO MEASURED THE CLOTH AND KEPT AN ACCOUNT OF THE PIECES BALED AND THEIR LENGTH IN YARDS
SO THE PLEASANTLY OCCUPIED YEARS SLIPPED ON I STILL NURSING MY PURPOSE OF A MORE SYSTEMATIC COURSE OF STUDY THOUGH I SAW NO NEAR POSSIBILITY OF ITS FULFILLMENT IT CAME IN AN UNEXPECTED WAY AS ALMOST EVERYTHING WORTH HAVING DOES COME
WE DID NOT LEAVE WORK EVEN TO GAZE AT DISTINGUISHED STRANGERS SO I MISSED SEEING HIM
I FELT ALMOST SURER OF THE FUTURE THAN OF THE PRESENT
THOSE WHO CAME AS SHE DID WERE USUALLY DISAPPOINTED INSTEAD OF AN ARCADIA THEY FOUND A PLACE OF MATTER OF FACT TOIL FILLED WITH A COMPANY OF INDUSTRIOUS WIDE AWAKE GIRLS WHO WERE FAITHFULLY IMPROVING THEIR OPPORTUNITIES
ITS GENUINE PIONEER FLAVOR WAS DELICIOUS AND MOREOVER IT WAS A PROPHECY TO SARAH EMILIE AND MYSELF WHO WERE ONE DAY THANKFUL ENOUGH TO FIND AN AUNTY PARSHALL'S DISH KETTLE IN A CABIN ON AN ILLINOIS PRAIRIE
WHO NEVER BROUGHT IT BACK I DO NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE EVER QUITE FORGIVEN HER I HAVE WISHED I COULD LOOK INTO IT AGAIN OFTEN AND OFTEN THROUGH THE YEARS BUT PERHAPS I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL TO THAT LITTLE GIRL FOR TEACHING ME TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT RETURNING BORROWED BOOKS MYSELF
CHAMBERS CYCLOPOEDIA OF ENGLISH LITERATURE WERE IN THE CITY LIBRARY AND I USED THEM MAKING EXTRACTS FROM CHAUCER AND SPENSER TO FIX THEIR PECULIARITIES IN MY MEMORY THOUGH THERE WAS ONLY A TASTE OF THEM TO BE HAD FROM THE CYCLOPAEDIA
THE MOST WIDESPREAD DELUSION OF THE TIME WAS MILLERISM A GREAT MANY PERSONS AND YET NOT SO MANY THAT I KNEW EVEN ONE OF THEM BELIEVED THAT THE END OF THE WORLD WAS COMING IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO THOUGH THE DATE WAS POSTPONED FROM YEAR TO YEAR AS THE PROPHESY FAILED OF FULFILLMENT
AS THE FRIENDS DO NOT BELIEVE IN STEEPLE HOUSES I WAS AT LIBERTY TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS MY THEME AND NOT MY VERSES THAT FAILED TO INTEREST HIM VARIOUS OTHER PAPERS WERE READ STORIES SKETCHES ET CETERA AND AFTER THE READING THERE WAS A LITTLE CONVERSATION
AS A LAUNDRESS TANS HER OWN FACE IN THE RAY TO CLEANSE THE GARMENTS OF OTHERS IT SUGGESTED A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR VERSE TO MY OWN MIND WHY SHOULD NOT OUR WASHERWOMAN'S WORK HAVE ITS TOUCH OF POETRY ALSO
OF BROWN IN THE SHADOW AND GOLD IN THE SUN IT WAS A REFRESHMENT AND AN INSPIRATION TO LOOK INTO THIS BOOK BETWEEN MY LONG ROWS OF FIGURES AND READ SUCH POEMS AS THE ANGEL OF PATIENCE FOLLEN
NEW ENGLAND HAD KEPT TO THE QUIET OLD FASHIONED WAYS OF LIVING FOR THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS OF THE REPUBLIC NOW ALL WAS EXPECTANCY CHANGES WERE COMING THINGS WERE GOING TO HAPPEN NOBODY COULD GUESS WHAT
MY ROOM MATE THE STUDENT'S SISTER WAS THE POSSESSOR OF AN ELECTRIFYING NEW POEM FESTUS THAT WE SAT UP NIGHTS TO READ IT DOES NOT SEEM AS IF IT COULD BE MORE THAN FORTY YEARS SINCE SARAH AND I LOOKED UP INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE FROM THE PAGE AS THE LAMPLIGHT GREW DIM AND SAID
AND OF ONE'S LIFE THAT MOST YOUNG PERSONS MUST OCCASIONALLY HAVE EXPERIENCED I OFTEN VAGUELY FELT HEAVENS OPENING FOR MY HALF FLEDGED WINGS TO TRY THEMSELVES IN THINGS ABOUT ME WERE GOOD AND ENJOYABLE BUT I COULD NOT QUITE REST IN THEM
I COPIED PASSAGES FROM JEREMY TAYLOR AND THE OLD THEOLOGIANS INTO MY NOTE BOOKS AND HAVE FOUND THEM USEFUL EVEN RECENTLY IN PREPARING COMPILATIONS DRYDEN AND THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY POETS GENERALLY DID NOT INTEREST ME THOUGH I TRIED TO READ THEM FROM A SENSE OF DUTY
ONLY A LOVER OF THEM CAN APPRECIATE THE LOSS OF ONE WHICH HAS BEEN A POSSESSION FROM CHILDHOOD YOUNG AND COWPER WERE CONSIDERED RELIGIOUS READING AND AS SUCH I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN SOMETHING OF THEM THE SONGS OF BURNS WERE IN THE AIR
THE DAYS WERE SO LOVELY AND SO LONG AND YET HOW FAST THEY SLIPPED AWAY I HAD NOT GIVEN UP MY DREAM OF A BETTER EDUCATION AND AS I COULD NOT GO TO SCHOOL I BEGAN TO STUDY BY MYSELF
FROM THE MERRIMACK TO THE MISSISSIPPI THE YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE AND EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE WHICH NEARLY COVER THE TIME I LIVED AT LOWELL SEEM TO ME AS I LOOK BACK AT THEM SINGULARLY INTERESTING YEARS
WHILE I WOULD HELP HER TO PUT HER COMPOSITIONS FOR THE OFFERING INTO PROPER STYLE SHE HAD NOT BEGUN TO GO TO SCHOOL AT TWO YEARS OLD
WE WERE ONLY BEGINNING TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO STEAMBOATS AND RAILROADS TO TRAVEL BY EITHER WAS SCARCELY LESS AN ADVENTURE TO US YOUNGER ONES THAN GOING UP IN A BALLOON PHRENOLOGY WAS MUCH TALKED ABOUT AND NUMEROUS PROFESSORS OF IT CAME AROUND LECTURING AND EXAMINING HEADS
WAS VERY NOTICEABLE POE CAME TO LOWELL TO LIVE AWHILE BUT IT WAS AFTER I HAD GONE AWAY OUR NATIONAL POETRY WAS AT THIS TIME JUST BEGINNING TO BE WELL KNOWN AND APPRECIATED
THOUGH THE ESPECIAL VERSE THAT I CONTRASTED WITH HERS WAS THERE'S PEACE AND WELCOME IN YON SEA OF ENDLESS BLUE TRANQUILLITY THOSE CLOUDS ARE LIVING THINGS I TRACE THEIR VEINS OF LIQUID GOLD AND SEE THEM SILENTLY UNFOLD THEIR SOFT AND FLEECY WINGS
THE DAY HAS A WHITE MARK AMONG MEMORIES OF MY LOWELL LIFE MISTER WHITTIER'S VISIT TO LOWELL HAD SOME POLITICAL BEARING UPON THE ANTISLAVERY CAUSE
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED AND CHANGES HAVE COME THE NEW ENGLAND THAT HAS GROWN UP WITH THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IS NOT AT ALL THE NEW ENGLAND THAT OUR FATHERS KNEW WE SPEAK OF HAVING BEEN REARED UNDER PURITANIC INFLUENCES
SOME OF MY WORK FOLK ACQUAINTANCES WERE REGULAR SUBSCRIBERS TO BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE AND THE WESTMINSTER AND EDINBURGH REVIEWS AND THEY LENT THEM TO ME THESE AND MACAULAY'S ESSAYS WERE A GREAT HELP AND DELIGHT
I'LL JOYFULLY LABOR BOTH
BUT THOSE WERE ALSO THE DAYS WHEN A WOMAN WAS NOT EXPECTED TO GIVE OR EVEN TO HAVE AN OPINION ON SUBJECTS OF PUBLIC INTEREST OCCASIONALLY A YOUNG GIRL WAS ATTRACTED TO THE LOWELL MILLS THROUGH HER OWN IDEALIZATION OF THE LIFE THERE
PERHAPS IT IS PARTLY BECAUSE THE HOME LIFE OF SWEDEN IS IN ITSELF SO DELIGHTFULLY UNIQUE WE READ GEORGE BORROW'S BIBLE IN SPAIN AND WANDERED WITH HIM AMONG THE GYPSIES TO WHOM HE SEEMED TO BELONG
YOU CAN'T STAND THE FIRE IN THAT GREAT DAY IT WAS THE REFRAIN OF A MILLERITE HYMN THE MILLERITES BELIEVED THAT THESE SIGNS IN THE SKY WERE OMENS OF THE APPROACHING CATASTROPHE
MADE THE PARADISE LOST A LANGUAGE STUDY IN AN EVENING CLASS UNDER ONE OF THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL MASTERS AND I NEVER OPEN TO THE MAJESTIC LINES HIGH ON A THRONE OF ROYAL
AND STEPHENS TO YUCATAN AND WE WERE AS FOND OF GOOD STORY BOOKS AS ANY GIRLS THAT LIVE IN THESE DAYS OF OVERFLOWING LIBRARIES ONE BOOK A CHARACTER PICTURE FROM HISTORY HAD A WIDE POPULARITY IN THOSE DAYS
FOR MYSELF NO AMOUNT OF MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN A TEMPTATION COMPARED WITH MY PRECIOUS DAYTIME FREEDOM WHOLE HOURS OF SUNSHINE FOR READING FOR WALKING FOR STUDYING FOR WRITING FOR ANYTHING THAT I WANTED TO DO
THERE WAS SOMETHING ALMOST PATHETIC IN THE READINESS WITH WHICH THIS WAS DONE BY YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE LONGING TO FIT THEMSELVES FOR TEACHERS BUT HAD NOT THE MEANS MANY A GIRL AT LOWELL WAS WORKING TO SEND HER BROTHER TO COLLEGE WHO HAD FAR MORE TALENT AND CHARACTER THAN HE
I COULD NEVER HAVE DREAMED THAT I WAS GOING TO MEET MY OPPORTUNITY NEARLY OR QUITE A THOUSAND MILES AWAY ON THE BANKS OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND YET WITH THAT STRANGE DELIGHTFUL CONSCIOUSNESS OF GROWTH INTO A COMPREHENSION OF ONE'S SELF
THERE WAS IN THIS VOLUME ANOTHER POEM WHICH IS NOT IN ANY OF THE LATER EDITIONS THE IMPRESSION OF WHICH AS IT REMAINS TO ME IN BROKEN SNATCHES IS VERY BEAUTIFUL IT BEGAN WITH THE LINES BIND UP THY TRESSES THOU BEAUTIFUL ONE
WE EXCHANGED CONFIDENCES LAUGHED AND CRIED TOGETHER READ WROTE WALKED VISITED AND STUDIED TOGETHER HER DRESS ALWAYS HAD AN AIRY TOUCH WHICH I ADMIRED ALTHOUGH I WAS RATHER INDIFFERENT AS TO WHAT I WORE MYSELF BUT SHE WOULD ENDEAVOR TO FIX ME UP TASTEFULLY
THESE WERE THE OPENING LINES OH WHAT IF THUS OUR EVIL DEEDS ARE MIRRORED ON THE SKY AND EVERY LINE OF OUR WILD LIVES DAGUERREOTYPED ON HIGH
BUT THAT HUGE CREAKING FRAMEWORK BESIDE US WOULD CONTINUALLY INTRUDE UPON OUR MEDITATIONS AND BREAK UP OUR DISCUSSIONS AND SILENCE ALL POETRY FOR US WITH ITS DULL PROSE EMILIE FOUND MORE PROFITABLE WORK ELSEWHERE AND I FOUND SOME THAT WAS LESS SO
OH DEAR OH DEAR WE SHA'N'T BE ALIVE IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE
IT IS SOMETHING TO HAVE BEEN SPARED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TAKING CHARGE OF THE LORD'S SILVER AND GOLD LET US BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT WE HAVE NOT AS WELL AS FOR WHAT WE HAVE
FOR THE FIRST TIME WHILE IT WAS YET A NEW POEM AND WHILE ONE'S OWN YOUNG LIFE WAS STIRRED BY THE PROPHETIC SPIRIT OF THE AGE THAT GAVE IT BIRTH
IT WAS THE FIRST HUMOROUS BOOK AS WELL AS THE FIRST HISTORY THAT I EVER CARED ABOUT AND I WAS PLEASED ENOUGH FOR I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WHEN MY FONDNESS FOR IT BEGAN
WHEN HE CAME AND SPOKE TO ME I LET THE FRIEND WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED ME DO MY PART OF THE TALKING FOR I WAS TOO MUCH OVERAWED BY THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHOSE POETRY I HAD SO LONG ADMIRED TO SAY A GREAT DEAL BUT FROM THAT EVENING WE KNEW EACH OTHER AS FRIENDS AND OF COURSE
AND ON THE TEMPLES HUNG OF MORN AND EVEN I LIKED BETTER A TRANSLATION FROM THE GERMAN BEGINNING METHINKS IT WERE NO PAIN TO DIE ON SUCH AN EVE WHILE SUCH A SKY O'ERCANOPIES THE WEST
A NATIVE PROFESSOR HAD FORMED A CLASS AMONG YOUNG WOMEN CONNECTED WITH THE MILLS AND WE JOINED IT
HE LENT ME THE FIRST VOLUME OF WHITTIER'S POEMS THAT I EVER SAW IT WAS A SMALL BOOK CONTAINING MOSTLY ANTISLAVERY PIECES THE YANKEE GIRL WAS ONE OF THEM FULLY TO APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE BEEN A WORKING GIRL IN SLAVE LABOR TIMES
IN SOME WAY FOR EVERY ONE OF US I SAID TO MYSELF THAT I COULD NOT HAVE MADE UP THOSE RHYMES NEVERTHELESS WE ALL LAUGHED AT THEM TOGETHER A COMET APPEARED AT ABOUT THE TIME OF THE MILLER EXCITEMENT AND ALSO A VERY UNUSUAL ILLUMINATION OF SKY AND EARTH BY THE AURORA BOREALIS
BUT WHAT I LEARNED REMAINED WITH ME NEVERTHELESS WITH MILTON I WAS MORE FAMILIAR THAN WITH ANY OTHER POET AND FROM THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE TO EIGHTEEN HE WAS MY PREFERENCE MY FRIEND ANGELINE AND I ANOTHER OF MY CLOTH ROOM ASSOCIATES
WHEN THE BREATH DIVINE IS FLOWING ZEPHYR LIKE O'ER ALL THINGS GOING AND AS THE TOUCH OF VIEWLESS FINGERS SOFTLY ON MY SOUL IT LINGERS OPEN TO A BREATH THE LIGHTEST CONSCIOUS OF A TOUCH THE SLIGHTEST
THE DAUGHTER OF ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS WHO ALSO WENT TO THE SAME CHURCH WITH US TOLD ME OF A VACANT PLACE IN THE CLOTH ROOM WHERE SHE WAS WHICH I GLADLY SECURED THIS WAS A LOW BRICK BUILDING NEXT THE COUNTING ROOM AND A LITTLE APART FROM THE MILLS
NOT AS A TASK BUT BECAUSE OF HER DELIGHT IN THEM ONE OF MY
I WAS ENJOYING IT ALL SO MUCH THAT I COULD NOT ANY LONGER CALL IT STUDY A GIFT FROM A FRIEND OF GRISWOLD'S POETS AND POETRY OF ENGLAND GAVE ME MY FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF TENNYSON IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE TO READ LOCKSLEY HALL
AND MY SISTER EMILIE AND MYSELF WERE AMONG HIS PUPILS WE CAME TO REGARD WAYLAND'S MORAL SCIENCE OUR TEXT BOOK
I HAD RECEIVED A PRETTY THOROUGH DRILL IN THE COMMON ENGLISH BRANCHES AT THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL AND AT MY EMPLOYMENT I ONLY NEEDED A LITTLE SIMPLE ARITHMETIC A FEW OF MY FRIENDS WERE STUDYING ALGEBRA IN AN EVENING CLASS BUT I HAD NO FANCY FOR MATHEMATICS
THE FEW OTHERS WHO MEASURED CLOTH WITH US WERE NICE BRIGHT GIRLS AND SOME OF THEM REMARKABLY PRETTY OUR WORK AND THE ROOM ITSELF WERE SO CLEAN THAT IN SUMMER WE COULD WEAR FRESH MUSLIN DRESSES SOMETIMES WHITE ONES
AND ELIZA AND I JOINED THAT ALSO THE MOST I RECALL ABOUT THAT IS THE DELIGHTFUL FLOWER HUNTING RAMBLES WE TOOK TOGETHER
I CONTRACTED AN UNCONQUERABLE DISLIKE TO IT INDEED I HAD NEVER LIKED AND NEVER COULD LEARN TO LIKE ANY KIND OF MACHINERY AND THIS MACHINE FINALLY CONQUERED ME IT WAS HUMILIATING BUT I HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WERE SOME THINGS I COULD NOT DO
IT OFTEN DOES SEEM TO HAVE AN OPPOSITE EFFECT BUT THEN
OUR COUNTRY OUR OWN FREE NATION BUT ANTISLAVERY SENTIMENTS WERE THEN REGARDED BY MANY AS TRAITOROUS HERESIES AND THOSE WHO HELD THEM DID NOT EXPECT TO WIN POPULARITY IF THE VOTE OF THE MILL GIRLS HAD BEEN TAKEN IT WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BEEN UNANIMOUS ON THE ANTISLAVERY SIDE
CONVEYING TO THE PEOPLE THE RESULTS OF STUDY AND THOUGHT THROUGH THE BEST MINDS AT LOWELL IT WAS MORE PATRONIZED BY THE MILL PEOPLE THAN ANY MERE ENTERTAINMENT WE HAD JOHN QUINCY ADAMS
WHAT MARRY ON RAILROAD TOO HE ASKED
AND INDEED NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE VALUED IT MORE THAN I DID IT CONTAINED SELECTIONS FROM STANDARD POETS AND CHOICE ONES FROM LESS FAMILIAR SOURCES ONE OF THE EXTRACTS WAS WORDSWORTH'S SUNSET AMONG THE MOUNTAINS FROM THE EXCURSION
FREEDOM TO LIVE ONE'S LIFE TRULY IS SURELY MORE DESIRABLE THAN ANY EARTHLY ACQUISITION OR POSSESSION AND AT MY NEW WORK I HAD HOURS OF FREEDOM EVERY DAY I NEVER WENT BACK AGAIN TO THE BONDAGE OF MACHINERY AND A WORKING DAY THIRTEEN HOURS LONG
THE TEST OF OUR PRONOUNCING ABILITIES SO COMPLETELY THAT THE PROFESSOR TOLD US A NATIVE REALLY WOULD UNDERSTAND US AT HIS REQUEST I PUT SOME LITTLE GERMAN SONGS INTO ENGLISH WHICH HE PUBLISHED AS SHEET MUSIC WITH MY NAME
OUR TASTES DID NOT QUITE AGREE HER FAVORITE DESCRIPTION OF THE CLOUDS WAS FROM POLLOK THEY SEEMED LIKE CHARIOTS OF SAINTS BY FIERY COURSERS DRAWN AS BRIGHTLY HUED AS IF THE GLORIOUS BUSHY GOLDEN LOCKS OF THOUSAND CHERUBIM HAD BEEN SHORN OFF
WHILE LOOKING THROUGH THEM INTO AVENUES TOWARD PROFIT AND USEFULNESS MORE DESIRABLE YET IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE WAY OF THE STEADY MINDED NEW ENGLANDER TO ACCEPT THE PRESENT SITUATION BUT TO ACCEPT IT WITHOUT BOUNDARIES TAKING IN ALSO THE LARGER PROSPECTS
TO READ WHICH HOWEVER OFTEN ALWAYS LIFTED ME INTO AN ECSTASY THAT RED MOROCCO BOOK WAS MY TREASURE IT TRAVELED WITH ME TO THE WEST AND I MEANT TO KEEP IT AS LONG AS I LIVED BUT ALAS
AND WE OCCASIONALLY HEARD OURSELVES SPOKEN OF AS THE CLOTH ROOM ARISTOCRACY BUT THAT WAS ONLY IN FUN MOST OF US HAD SERVED AN APPRENTICESHIP IN THE MILLS AND MANY OF OUR BEST FRIENDS WERE STILL THERE PREFERRING THEIR WORK BECAUSE IT BROUGHT THEM MORE MONEY THAN WE COULD EARN
AND MAKING CHARTS OF CRANIAL BUMPS THIS WAS PROFITABLE BUSINESS TO THEM FOR A WHILE AS ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO INVESTED IN A CHARACTER RECEIVED A GOOD ONE WHILE MANY VERY COMMONPLACE PEOPLE WERE FLATTERED INTO THE BELIEF THAT THEY WERE GENIUSES OR MIGHT BE IF THEY CHOSE
BRYANT HAD PUBLISHED TWO VOLUMES AND EVERY SCHOOL CHILD WAS FAMILIAR WITH HIS DEATH OF THE FLOWERS AND GOD'S FIRST TEMPLES SOME ONE LENT ME THE VOICES OF THE NIGHT THE ONLY COLLECTION OF LONGFELLOW'S VERSE THEN ISSUED I THINK
MESMERISM FOLLOWED CLOSE UPON PHRENOLOGY AND THIS TOO HAD ITS LECTURERS WHO ENTERTAINED THE STRONGER PORTION OF THEIR AUDIENCES BY SHOWING THEM HOW EASILY THE WEAKER ONES COULD BE BROUGHT UNDER AN UNCANNY INFLUENCE
A VALUABLE OLD BOOK THAT
THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS STILL AN UNDEVELOPED MYSTERY THINGS THAT LOOKED MIRACULOUS THEN ARE COMMONPLACE NOW IT ALMOST SEEMS AS IF THE CHILDREN OF TO DAY COULD NOT HAVE SO GOOD A TIME AS WE DID SCIENCE HAS LEFT THEM SO LITTLE TO WONDER ABOUT
IN A FRAGMENTARY WAY THE TEMPEST AND MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM AND KING LEAR I HAD SWALLOWED AMONG MY FAIRY TALES NOW I DISCOVERED THAT THE HISTORICAL PLAYS NOTABLY JULIUS CAESAR AND CORIOLANUS HAD NO LESS ATTRACTION FOR ME THOUGH OF A DIFFERENT KIND
BUT FAR MORE SATISFACTORY AS IT WOULD GIVE ME THE OPENINGS OF LEISURE WHICH I CRAVED THE PAYMASTER ASKED WHEN I LEFT GOING WHERE ON CAN EARN MORE MONEY NO I ANSWERED I AM GOING WHERE I CAN HAVE MORE TIME
THE IDEA IN ITSELF WAS ALMOST TOO SERIOUS TO BE JESTED ABOUT AND YET ITS ADVOCATES MADE IT SO LITERAL A MATTER THAT IT DID LOOK VERY RIDICULOUS TO UNBELIEVERS AN IRREVERENT LITTLE WORKMATE OF MINE IN THE SPINNING ROOM MADE A STRING OF JINGLING COUPLETS ABOUT IT LIKE THIS
WE HAD THE DELIGHT OF READING FREDERIKA BREMER'S HOME AND NEIGHBORS WHEN THEY WERE FRESH FROM THE FOUNTAINS OF HER OWN HEART AND SOME OF US MUST NOT BE BLAMED FOR FEELING AS IF NO TALES OF DOMESTIC LIFE HALF SO CHARMING HAVE BEEN WRITTEN SINCE
IT WAS INDEED A BOND OF NEIGHBORLY UNION BETWEEN A GREAT MANY HOUSEHOLDS IN THE YOUNG MANUFACTURING CITY
ALL THE HEAVENS ABOVE AND THE EARTH BENEATH TOWARDS WHICH IT OPENS THE MOVEMENT OF NEW ENGLAND GIRLS TOWARD LOWELL WAS ONLY AN IMPULSE OF A LARGER MOVEMENT WHICH ABOUT THAT TIME SENT SO MANY PEOPLE FROM THE EASTERN STATES INTO THE WEST
I FELT RELIEVED FOR I WAS NOT FOND OF HAVING MY PRODUCTIONS SPOKEN OF FOR GOOD OR ILL HE COMMENDED QUITE HIGHLY A POEM BY ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE CIRCLE ON PENTUCKET THE INDIAN NAME OF HIS NATIVE PLACE HAVERHILL MY SUBJECT WAS SABBATH BELLS
AND THAT WAS THE OPENING TO US OF ANOTHER DOOR TOWARDS THE BEAUTIFUL
ALTHOUGH I DID PITY THE MISERABLE JEW
A SCHOOL TEACHER WHO CAME TO SEE FOR HERSELF HOW THE LOWELL GIRLS LIVED OF WHOM SHE HAD HEARD SO MUCH A DEEP QUIET FRIENDSHIP GREW UP BETWEEN US TWO I WROTE SOME VERSES FOR HER WHEN WE PARTED AND SHE SENT ME ONE CORDIAL CHARMINGLY WRITTEN LETTER
THEN SHE WOULD TELL ME THAT MY NATURE INCLINED TO QUIETNESS AND HARMONY WHILE HERS ASKED FOR MOTION AND SPLENDOR I WONDERED WHETHER IT REALLY WERE SO
BUT A MAN COULD PREACH AND IT WAS NOT ORTHODOX TO THINK THAT A WOMAN COULD AND IN HER DEVOTION TO HIM AND HER ZEAL FOR THE SPREAD OF CHRISTIAN TRUTH SHE WAS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF HER OWN SACRIFICE
IT WAS MORE AIRY AND FEWER GIRLS WERE IN THE ROOM
BUT SHE KNEW HER DEFICIENCIES AND EARNED MONEY ENOUGH TO LEAVE HER WORK AND ATTEND A DAY SCHOOL PART OF THE YEAR
AND ASSEMBLE SOMEWHERE TO WAIT FOR THE EXPECTED HOUR WHEN DAGUERREOTYPES WERE FIRST MADE WHEN WE HEARD THAT THE SUN WAS GOING TO TAKE EVERYBODY'S PORTRAIT IT SEEMED ALMOST TOO GREAT A MARVEL TO BE BELIEVED
BUT I JUST MISSED SEEING HIM SOMETIMES AN ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS STUDYING OUR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WOULD CALL AND HAVE A FRIENDLY TALK WITH US AT WORK SOMETIMES IT WAS A TRAVELER FROM THE SOUTH WHO WAS INTERESTED IN SOME WAY
I HAD A FRIEND ABOUT MY OWN AGE AND BETWEEN US THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY MUCH LIKE WHAT IS CALLED A SCHOOL GIRL FRIENDSHIP A KIND OF INTIMACY SUPPOSED TO BE SUPERFICIAL BUT OFTEN AS DEEP AND PERMANENT AS IT IS PLEASANT
MADE HIM A TOWER OF STRENGTH IN THE CHURCH AND IN THE COMMUNITY HE KEPT A SILENT KINDLY RIGID WATCH OVER THE CORPORATION LIFE OF WHICH HE WAS THE HEAD AND ONLY THOSE OF US WHO WERE INCIDENTALLY ADMITTED TO HIS CONFIDENCE KNEW HOW CAREFULLY WE WERE GUARDED
MY FIRST WISH WAS TO LEARN ABOUT ENGLISH LITERATURE TO GO BACK TO ITS VERY BEGINNINGS IT WAS NOT THEN STUDIED EVEN IN THE HIGHER SCHOOLS AND I KNEW NO ONE WHO COULD GIVE ME ANY ASSISTANCE IN IT AS A TEACHER PERCY'S RELIQUES AND
COLD AS IT WAS WINDOWS WERE THROWN UP ALL AROUND US FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK OUT AT THE WONDERFUL SIGHT I WAS GAZING WITH THE REST AND LISTENING TO EXCLAMATIONS OF WONDER FROM SURROUNDING UNSEEN BEHOLDERS WHEN SOMEBODY SHOUTED FROM FAR DOWN THE OPPOSITE BLOCK OF BUILDINGS WITH STARTLING EFFECT
SHE WAS ONE WHO FOUND THE HAPPINESS OF HER LIFE IN DOING KINDNESSES FOR OTHERS AND IN HELPING THEM BEAR THEIR BURDENS FAMILY REVERSES HAD BROUGHT HER WITH HER MOTHER AND SISTERS TO LOWELL AND THIS WAS ONE STRONG POINT OF SYMPATHY BETWEEN MY OWN FAMILY AND HERS
A FACTORY BOARDING HOUSE IN A NEAT LITTLE PARLOR WHICH CONTAINED A PIANO THE PROFESSOR WAS A MUSIC TEACHER ALSO
I OFTEN RECALL HER FEATURES AND THE TONE OF HER VOICE IT WAS AS IF A BEAUTIFUL SPIRIT FROM AN INVISIBLE WORLD HAD SLIPPED IN AMONG US AND QUICKLY GONE BACK AGAIN
WE WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE BOOKS IN THE CLOTH ROOM THE ABSENCE OF MACHINERY PERMITTED THAT PRIVILEGE OUR SUPERINTENDENT WHO WAS A MAN OF CULTURE AND A CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN OF THE PURITAN SCHOOL
SOME OF MY CHOICEST EXTRACTS WERE IN THE FIRST VOLUME OF COLLECTED POETRY I EVER OWNED A LITTLE RED MOROCCO BOOK CALLED THE YOUNG MAN'S BOOK OF POETRY IT WAS GIVEN ME BY ONE OF MY SISTERS WHEN I WAS ABOUT A DOZEN YEARS OLD
THE FOOTSTEPS OF ANGELS GLIDED AT ONCE INTO MY MEMORY AND TOOK POSSESSION OF A PERMANENT PLACE THERE WITH ITS TENDER MELODY THE LAST LEAF AND OLD IRONSIDES WERE FAVORITES WITH EVERYBODY WHO READ POETRY AT ALL
AND GROW STRONG BY STRIVING LED ONWARD ALWAYS BY AN INVISIBLE GUIDE LIFE TO ME AS I LOOKED FORWARD WAS A BRIGHT BLANK OF MYSTERY LIKE THE BROAD WESTERN TRACTS OF OUR CONTINENT WHICH IN THE ATLASES OF THOSE DAYS BORE THE TITLE OF UNEXPLORED REGIONS
THROUGH HIM I BEST LEARNED TO KNOW POETRY AS SONG I THINK THAT I HEARD THE COTTER'S SATURDAY NIGHT AND A MAN'S A MAN FOR A THAT MORE FREQUENTLY QUOTED THAN ANY OTHER POEMS FAMILIAR TO MY GIRLHOOD
HERO WORSHIP BROUGHT US A STARTLING AND KEEN ENJOYMENT IT WAS LENT ME BY A DARTMOUTH COLLEGE STUDENT THE BROTHER OF ONE OF MY ROOM MATES SOON AFTER IT WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN THIS COUNTRY
AND THAT WONDERFULLY RENDERED HYMN FROM LAMARTINE THAT USED TO WHISPER ITSELF THROUGH ME AFTER I HAD READ IT LIKE THE ECHO OF A SPIRIT'S VOICE
AND IN A SHORT TIME FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT PALACE HE EVER BEHELD
AND APPOINTED THAT DAY TWELVEMONTH FOR THEIR RETURN THEY SET OFF ON THEIR TRAVELS
TO GIVE HIM ADMITTANCE INTO A SPLENDID APARTMENT BUILT OF MOTHER OF PEARL
SHE NEXT CONDUCTED ME TO THIS PALACE WHICH BELONGED TO MY FATHER AND GAVE ME A TRAIN OF CATS FOR MY ATTENDANTS TOGETHER WITH THE TWELVE HANDS WHICH WAITED ON YOUR HIGHNESS SHE THEN INFORMED ME OF MY BIRTH
YOUR PRESENCE AFFORDS ME THE GREATEST PLEASURE MADAM REPLIED THE PRINCE I WOULD FAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR GENEROSITY NOR CAN I HELP OBSERVING
AND THE PRINCE AND WHITE CAT SEATED THEMSELVES
EVERY THING WENT ON AS BEFORE TILL THE END OF ANOTHER YEAR AT LENGTH ONLY ONE DAY REMAINED OF THE YEAR WHEN THE WHITE CAT THUS ADDRESSED HIM TO MORROW MY PRINCE
WHEN THE QUEEN HAD EATEN HER FILL SHE ORDERED FOUR THOUSAND MULES TO BE PROCURED AND LOADED WITH THE FRUIT WHICH HAD THE VIRTUE OF CONTINUING ALL THE YEAR ROUND IN A STATE OF PERFECTION
AND MAKE NO DECISION CONCERNING THE BEAUTY OF THREE PRINCESSES WHO WITHOUT SUCH A PROOF OF YOUR MAJESTY'S PREFERENCE WILL NO DOUBT LIVE HAPPILY TOGETHER THE AIR RESOUNDED
AS I WISHED TO SPEAK WITH HIM HE DID NOT FAIL
I BEGGED THE FAIRIES TO BRING ME A NETTING NEEDLE A MESH AND SOME CORD SAYING I WISHED TO MAKE SOME NETS TO AMUSE MYSELF WITH CATCHING BIRDS AT MY WINDOW THIS THEY READILY COMPLIED WITH AND IN A SHORT TIME I COMPLETED A LADDER LONG ENOUGH TO REACH THE GROUND
FINEST LINEN IMAGINABLE AND THEN ADDED A COMMODIOUS WRAPPING GOWN EMBROIDERED WITH THE BRIGHTEST GOLD AND ALL OVER ENRICHED WITH PEARLS
OF THE MOST DELICIOUS LIQUEURS WHICH BEING OFTEN REPEATED MADE HIM FORGET THAT HE WAS TO PROCURE A LITTLE DOG FOR THE OLD KING HE THOUGHT NO LONGER OF ANY THING
HE SET OUT ON HIS RETURN THE PRINCE ARRIVED FIRST AT THE PLACE OF RENDEZVOUS AND WAS SOON JOINED BY HIS BROTHERS THEY MUTUALLY EMBRACED AND BEGAN TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR SUCCESS
HE CONSENTED TO GIVE ME INTO THEIR HANDS I WAS ACCORDINGLY LAID IN A CRADLE OF MOTHER OF PEARL ORNAMENTED WITH GOLD AND JEWELS AND CARRIED TO THEIR PALACE WHEN THE DRAGON IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED
OF ONLY THE YOUNGEST WHO WAS THE HANDSOMEST MOST AMIABLE AND ACCOMPLISHED PRINCE THAT HAD EVER BEEN SEEN NO DAY PASSED AS HE TRAVELLED FROM TOWN TO TOWN THAT HE DID NOT BUY ALL THE HANDSOME DOGS THAT FELL IN HIS WAY
SHOWING HIM AN ACORN THIS CONTAINS WHAT YOU DESIRE THE PRINCE PUT THE ACORN TO HIS EAR AND HEARD THE BARKING OF A LITTLE DOG TRANSPORTED WITH JOY HE THANKED THE CAT A THOUSAND TIMES AND THE NEXT DAY
AND THE CAT CONTINUING TO PRESS HIM WITH GREATER EAGERNESS WITH A TREMBLING HAND HE DREW HIS SWORD CUT OFF HER HEAD AND TAIL AND THREW THEM INTO THE FIRE NO SOONER WAS THIS DONE THAN THE MOST
AND BEHIND THE CAR A THOUSAND GUARDS RICHLY APPARELLED WERE IN WAITING TO ATTEND ON THE PRINCE'S PERSON SHE THEN PRESENTED HIM WITH A NUT YOU WILL FIND IN IT SAID SHE THE PIECE OF CAMBRIC I PROMISED YOU
THE WALLS OF THE BUILDING WERE OF TRANSPARENT PORCELAIN VARIOUSLY COLOURED AND REPRESENTED THE HISTORY OF ALL THE FAIRIES THAT HAD EXISTED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD THE PRINCE COMING BACK TO THE GOLDEN DOOR OBSERVED A DEER'S FOOT
I NEED NOT ADD THAT I ALREADY LOVE YOU MORE THAN MY LIFE LET US THEREFORE HASTEN TO THE PALACE OF THE KING YOUR FATHER AND OBTAIN HIS APPROBATION TO OUR MARRIAGE
THEY ACCORDINGLY BEGAN TO DISPUTE WHEN THE YOUNGEST PRINCE TAKING HIS ACORN FROM HIS POCKET SOON ENDED THEIR CONTENTION FOR A LITTLE DOG APPEARED WHICH COULD WITH EASE GO THROUGH THE SMALLEST RING
THE OLD FAIRY THEN INFORMED THE QUEEN THAT WHAT THEY REQUIRED WAS THAT SHE WOULD GIVE THEM THE CHILD SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE AS SOON AS SHE SHOULD BE BORN ADDING
FESTOONED WITH BUNCHES OF THE GAYEST RIBANDS AND THE LOOKING GLASSES REACHED FROM THE FLOOR TO THE CEILING THE PRINCE WAS UNDRESSED AND PUT INTO BED BY THE HANDS WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD HE HOWEVER SLEPT LITTLE
AFTER WHICH THE PRINCE GAVE THE WHITE CAT AN ACCOUNT OF THE ADMIRATION WHICH HAD BEEN BESTOWED ON THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE DOG AND INFORMED HER OF HIS FATHER'S FARTHER INJUNCTION MAKE YOURSELF PERFECTLY EASY DEAR PRINCE SAID SHE
THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS ACCORDINGLY SET OUT SIDE BY SIDE IN A CAR OF STILL GREATER SPLENDOUR THAN BEFORE AND REACHED THE PALACE JUST AS THE TWO BROTHERS HAD ARRIVED WITH TWO BEAUTIFUL PRINCESSES
HE THOUGHT ME A MOST CHARMING LADY AND THAT HE SHOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY IF HE DID NOT PASS HIS LIFE IN MY COMPANY
AND ALSO BELIEVING HE SHOULD FIND SOME MEANS OF KEEPING ME IN A PLACE OF SAFETY WHICH THE FAIRIES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO APPROACH AS SOON THEREFORE AS I WAS BORN HE HAD ME CONVEYED TO A TOWER IN THE PALACE
THE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER DID BUT INCREASE THE VIOLENCE OF MY MOTHER'S LONGING FOR SHE SAW THE TOPS OF THE TREES ABOVE THE GARDEN WALLS LOADED WITH THE MOST LUSCIOUS FRUITS THE QUEEN IN DESPAIR
THE VIEW OF THE ONE MADE THE PRINCE ALMOST AFRAID TO TASTE THE OTHER TILL THE WHITE CAT WHO GUESSED HIS THOUGHTS ASSURED HIM THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN DISHES AT TABLE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A MORSEL OF EITHER RAT OR MOUSE
HE WAS STOPPED BY THE HANDS AND A LARGE EASY CHAIR ADVANCED OF ITSELF TOWARDS THE CHIMNEY AND THE HANDS WHICH HE OBSERVED WERE EXTREMELY WHITE AND DELICATE TOOK OFF HIS WET CLOTHES AND SUPPLIED THEIR PLACE WITH THE
CAME TO OFFER THEIR CONGRATULATIONS TO THE QUEEN AND INQUIRE
PERMIT ME TO BESTOW ONE ON EACH OF THE ELDEST PRINCES AND TO ENJOY THE REMAINING FOUR IN THE SOCIETY OF THE YOUNGEST AND MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY TO KEEP YOUR OWN KINGDOM
AND THE YOUNGEST REMOUNTED HIS WOODEN HORSE AND IN A SHORT TIME ARRIVED AT THE PALACE OF HIS BELOVED WHITE CAT WHO RECEIVED HIM WITH THE GREATEST JOY WHILE THE TRUNKLESS HANDS HELPED HIM TO DISMOUNT AND PROVIDED HIM WITH IMMEDIATE REFRESHMENTS
ONE NIGHT AS SHE LAY HALF ASLEEP SHE TURNED HERSELF ABOUT AND OPENING HER EYES PERCEIVED A LITTLE OLD WOMAN VERY UGLY AND DEFORMED SEATED IN THE EASY CHAIR BY HER BEDSIDE
THE YOUNGEST PRODUCED HIS CUR DIRTY ALL OVER AND ALL WONDERED HOW THE PRINCE COULD HOPE TO RECEIVE A CROWN FOR SUCH A PRESENT THE KING EXAMINED THE TWO LITTLE DOGS OF THE ELDER PRINCES
WHEN THE CAT TOLD HIM NOT TO BE SO SORROWFUL SINCE SHE WOULD NOT ONLY PROVIDE HIM WITH A LITTLE DOG BUT ALSO WITH A WOODEN HORSE WHICH SHOULD CONVEY HIM SAFELY IN LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS LOOK HERE SAID SHE
HE DREW FORTH A PIECE OF CAMBRIC FOUR HUNDRED YARDS LONG AND FINE ENOUGH TO BE DRAWN WITH PERFECT EASE THROUGH THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE WHEN THE KING FOUND HE HAD NO PRETEXT LEFT
WELCOME PRINCE NO DANGER FEAR
THE NEXT DAY THEY WENT TOGETHER TO THE PALACE THE DOGS OF THE TWO ELDER PRINCES WERE LYING ON CUSHIONS AND SO CURIOUSLY WRAPPED AROUND WITH EMBROIDERED QUILTS
PRODUCED A PIECE OF CAMBRIC THAT WAS SO EXTREMELY FINE THAT HIS FRIENDS HAD NO DOUBT OF ITS PASSING THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE WHICH WAS NOW DELIVERED TO THE KING HAVING BEEN KEPT LOCKED UP IN THE CUSTODY OF HIS MAJESTY'S TREASURER ALL THE TIME
SO FINE AS TO BE DRAWN THROUGH THE EYE OF A SMALL NEEDLE THE THREE PRINCES THOUGHT THIS VERY HARD YET THEY SET OUT IN OBEDIENCE TO THE KING'S COMMAND THE TWO ELDEST TOOK DIFFERENT ROADS
FOR THE TIME IS COME WHEN THE ENCHANTMENT BY WHICH I AM BOUND MAY BE ENDED YOU MUST CUT OFF MY HEAD AND TAIL CONTINUED SHE AND THROW THEM INTO THE FIRE I
THE NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT I AGAIN PLACED MYSELF AT THE WINDOW AND HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THAT THE GENTLEMAN HAD RETURNED TO THE SAME PLACE HE NOW SPOKE TO ME THROUGH A SPEAKING TRUMPET AND INFORMED ME
EITHER MAKE YOURSELF A LADY OR MAKE ME A CAT SHE SMILED AT THE PRINCE'S WISH BUT MADE HIM SCARCELY ANY REPLY AT LENGTH THE TWELVEMONTH WAS NEARLY EXPIRED
SHE RECEIVED THEM WITH THE GREATEST KINDNESS AND ORDERING THEM TO WITHDRAW SHE THUS ADDRESSED THE ASTONISHED PRINCE DO NOT IMAGINE DEAR PRINCE THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A CAT OR THAT I AM OF OBSCURE BIRTH
FOR A LONG TIME HE PERCEIVED A LIGHT WHICH MADE HIM SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS NOT FAR FROM SOME HOUSE HE ACCORDINGLY PURSUED HIS WAY TOWARDS IT
TO WHICH THERE WERE TWENTY FLIGHTS OF STAIRS AND A DOOR TO EACH OF WHICH MY FATHER KEPT THE KEY SO THAT NONE CAME NEAR ME WITHOUT HIS CONSENT WHEN THE FAIRIES HEARD OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE
EVERY ONE SUPPOSED HE WOULD CERTAINLY OBTAIN THE CROWN BUT WHEN THE KING TRIED TO DRAW IT THROUGH THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE IT WOULD NOT PASS THOUGH IT FAILED BUT
BUT HAVING WAITED SIX WEEKS WITHOUT SEEING ANY ONE PASS THE GATES SHE FELL SICK OF VEXATION AND HER LIFE WAS DESPAIRED OF
COVERED WITH SAPPHIRE STONES WHICH CAST SO RESPLENDENT A BRIGHTNESS OVER EVERYTHING AROUND THAT SCARCELY COULD THE STRONGEST EYESIGHT BEAR TO LOOK AT IT THIS WAS THE LIGHT THE PRINCE HAD SEEN FROM THE FOREST
AND THE DEATH OF MY PARENTS AND PRONOUNCED UPON ME WHAT SHE IMAGINED THE GREATEST OF MALEDICTIONS THAT I SHOULD NOT BE RESTORED TO MY NATURAL FIGURE TILL
A LONG BLACK VEIL AND WAS SUPPORTED BY TWO CATS DRESSED IN MOURNING AND WITH SWORDS BY THEIR SIDES THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY A NUMEROUS RETINUE OF CATS SOME CARRYING CAGES FULL OF RATS
THE KING HEARING THAT EACH OF HIS SONS HAD SUCCEEDED IN FINDING WHAT HE HAD REQUIRED AGAIN BEGAN TO THINK OF SOME NEW EXPEDIENT TO DELAY THE TIME OF HIS RESIGNING HIS CROWN BUT WHEN THE WHOLE COURT
AND OTHERS MOUSETRAPS FULL OF MICE THE PRINCE WAS AT A LOSS
NIGHT SUDDENLY CAME ON AND WITH IT A VIOLENT STORM OF THUNDER LIGHTNING AND RAIN TO ADD TO HIS PERPLEXITY HE LOST HIS PATH AND COULD FIND NO WAY OUT OF THE FOREST AFTER HE HAD GROPED ABOUT
SHE ACCORDINGLY ORDERED THE MOST CURIOUS FIREWORKS TO BE PLAYED OFF IN SIGHT OF THE WINDOW OF THE APARTMENT IN WHICH THEY WERE SITTING AND NOTHING BUT FESTIVITY AND REJOICING WAS HEARD THROUGHOUT THE PALACE FOR THE PRINCE'S RETURN
THAT SHE EXPECTED MY BIRTH SHE GREW VERY MELANCHOLY TILL AT LENGTH BEING PRESSED BY THE KING SHE DECLARED TO HIM THE TRUTH
YOU MUST PRESENT YOURSELF AT THE PALACE OF YOUR FATHER AND GIVE HIM A PROOF OF YOUR OBEDIENCE IT DEPENDS ONLY ON YOURSELF TO CONDUCT THITHER THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS EVER YET BEHELD
MY CLOTHES WERE SPLENDID AND I WAS INSTRUCTED IN EVERY KIND OF ACCOMPLISHMENT IN SHORT PRINCE IF I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE BUT THEMSELVES I SHOULD HAVE REMAINED VERY HAPPY
HE WALKED ON IN GREAT PERPLEXITY TILL HE ENTERED A VESTIBULE INLAID WITH PORPHYRY AND LAPIS STONE THERE THE MOST MELODIOUS VOICE HE HAD EVER HEARD CHANTED THE FOLLOWING WORDS
FOR REFUSING THE CROWN TO HIS YOUNGEST SON HE SIGHED DEEPLY AND IT WAS EASY TO BE SEEN THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR THE PRINCE'S SUCCESS MY SONS SAID HE
WHEN THE YOUNGEST SHOWED THEM ONLY A LITTLE MONGREL CUR TELLING THEM HE THOUGHT IT COULD NOT FAIL TO PLEASE THE KING FROM ITS EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTY THE BROTHERS TROD ON EACH OTHER'S TOES UNDER THE TABLE
AND IN THE MORNING WAS AWAKED BY A CONFUSED NOISE THE HANDS TOOK HIM OUT OF BED AND PUT ON HIM A HANDSOME HUNTING JACKET HE LOOKED INTO THE COURT YARD AND PERCEIVED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED CATS
THE PRINCE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN HIS COUNTRY AND RELATIONS AND SOMETIMES EVEN REGRETTED THAT HE WAS NOT A CAT SO GREAT WAS HIS AFFECTION FOR HIS MEWING COMPANIONS ALAS SAID HE TO THE WHITE CAT
I AND MY SISTER FAIRIES SAID SHE TAKE IT VERY ILL THAT YOUR MAJESTY SHOULD SO OBSTINATELY PERSIST IN GETTING SOME OF OUR FRUIT BUT SINCE SO PRECIOUS A LIFE IS AT STAKE
WHICH SHE FOUND TO BE A MAGNIFICENT PALACE ON ALL SIDES GLITTERING WITH GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES SHE KNOCKED A LONG TIME AT THE GATES BUT NO ONE CAME
FAIRIES WHO WERE IN POSSESSION OF THE LARGEST GARDENS FILLED WITH THE MOST DELICIOUS FRUITS SHE HAD SO STRONG A DESIRE TO EAT SOME OF THEM THAT SHE SET OUT FOR THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY LIVED SHE ARRIVED AT THEIR ABODE
WHO ACCORDINGLY ADVANCED AND OPENING AN ELEGANT LITTLE BOX INLAID WITH JEWELS HE TOOK OUT A WALNUT AND CRACKED THE SHELL
HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING MORE TO HIS PURPOSE THAN TELLING HIS SONS THAT HE WAS EXTREMELY OBLIGED TO THEM FOR THE PAINS THEY HAD TAKEN AND THAT SINCE THEY HAD SUCCEEDED SO WELL HE COULD NOT BUT WISH THEY WOULD MAKE A SECOND ATTEMPT
WERE WITH THE KING ASSEMBLED TO PASS JUDGMENT THE PRINCESS WHO ACCOMPANIED THE YOUNGEST PERCEIVING HIS THOUGHTS BY HIS COUNTENANCE
FASTENED TO A CHAIN OF DIAMONDS HE COULD NOT HELP WONDERING AT THE MAGNIFICENCE HE BEHELD AND THE SECURITY IN WHICH THE INHABITANTS SEEMED TO LIVE
DO NOT BREAK THE SHELL TILL YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE KING YOUR FATHER THEN
HE DETERMINED TO EMPLOY THE PRINCES IN SUCH A MANNER AS AT ONCE TO GIVE EACH OF THEM THE HOPE OF SUCCEEDING TO THE CROWN AND FILL UP THE TIME THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE SPEND IN SO UNDUTIFUL A MANNER
YOU SHOULD PROCURE ME SOME AMUSEMENT IN MY RETIREMENT BEFORE I LEAVE THE CAPITAL FOR EVER I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT A LITTLE DOG THAT IS HANDSOME FAITHFUL AND ENGAGING WOULD BE THE
MY FATHER WAS THE MONARCH OF SIX KINGDOMS HE TENDERLY LOVED MY MOTHER LEAVING HER ALWAYS AT LIBERTY TO FOLLOW HER OWN INCLINATIONS HER PREVAILING PASSION WAS TO TRAVEL
AND DEMANDED AN IMMEDIATE AUDIENCE OF THE KING WHO RECEIVED THEM WITH THE GREATEST KINDNESS THE PRINCES HASTENED TO PLACE AT THE FEET OF HIS MAJESTY THE CURIOUS PRESENT HE HAD REQUIRED THEM TO PROCURE THE ELDEST
THE HANDS NEXT BROUGHT HIM AN ELEGANT DRESSING TABLE AND COMBED HIS HAIR SO VERY GENTLY THAT HE SCARCELY FELT THEIR TOUCH THEY HELD BEFORE HIM A BEAUTIFUL BASIN FILLED WITH PERFUMES
THAT EVERY POSSIBLE CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN OF HER AND THAT SHE SHOULD BECOME THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED PRINCESS THE QUEEN REPLIED THAT HOWEVER CRUEL THE CONDITION SHE MUST ACCEPT IT SINCE NOTHING BUT THE FRUIT COULD SAVE HER LIFE
BUT PRINCE I AM NOT FOND OF TALKING AND LEAST OF ALL DO I LIKE COMPLIMENTS LET US THEREFORE SIT DOWN TO SUPPER THE TRUNKLESS HANDS THEN PLACED THE DISHES ON THE TABLE
REFRAIN FROM LAUGHING TO THINK HE SHOULD BE SO SILLY AS TO CLAIM WITH THEM THE CROWN ON NO BETTER PRETENSIONS THE PRINCE HOWEVER CRACKED THE CHERRY STONE WHICH WAS FILLED WITH A KERNEL
HE BEGGED HER PERMISSION TO LOOK AT IT WHEN TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HE SAW THE PORTRAIT OF A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN THAT EXACTLY RESEMBLED HIMSELF
BUT ALAS WITH NO BETTER SUCCESS FOR THOUGH HIS PIECE OF CAMBRIC WAS EXQUISITELY FINE YET IT COULD NOT BE DRAWN THROUGH THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE IT WAS NOW THE YOUNGEST PRINCE'S TURN
ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF MY TOWER OVERLOOKED A LONG AVENUE SHADED WITH TREES SO THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN IN IT A HUMAN CREATURE ONE DAY HOWEVER AS I WAS TALKING AT THIS WINDOW WITH MY PARROT
HE SENT FOR THEM TO HIS CABINET AND AFTER CONVERSING WITH THEM KINDLY HE ADDED YOU MUST BE SENSIBLE MY DEAR CHILDREN THAT MY GREAT AGE PREVENTS ME FROM ATTENDING SO CLOSELY AS I HAVE HITHERTO DONE
YOU MUST UNDERTAKE ANOTHER EXPEDITION AND WHICHEVER BY THE END OF A YEAR BRINGS ME THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY SHALL MARRY HER
BEGAN TO DIE IN GREAT ABUNDANCE THE GRIEF OF THE KING AT SEEING THIS COULD SCARCELY BE EQUALLED
AND AS MANY OF THE SAPPHIRE STONES AS WOULD MAKE THEIR FORTUNES HE PULLED THE CHAIN AND HEARD A BELL THE SOUND OF WHICH WAS EXQUISITE IN A FEW MOMENTS THE DOOR WAS OPENED BUT HE PERCEIVED NOTHING BUT
THE PRINCES WERE MUCH SURPRISED AT THE FANCY OF THEIR FATHER TO HAVE A LITTLE DOG YET THEY ACCEPTED THE PROPOSITION WITH PLEASURE AND ACCORDINGLY AFTER TAKING LEAVE OF THE KING WHO PRESENTED THEM WITH ABUNDANCE OF MONEY AND JEWELS
TO STATE AFFAIRS I FEAR THIS MAY BE INJURIOUS TO MY SUBJECTS I THEREFORE DESIRE TO PLACE MY CROWN ON THE HEAD OF ONE OF YOU BUT IT IS NO MORE THAN JUST THAT IN RETURN FOR SUCH A PRESENT
WITH THE APPLAUSES OF THE ASSEMBLY THE YOUNG PRINCE AND PRINCESS EMBRACED THE KING AND NEXT THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS
SAID THE PRINCE HASTILY I CUT OFF YOUR HEAD AND TAIL YOU SURELY MEAN TO TRY MY AFFECTION WHICH BELIEVE ME BEAUTIFUL CAT IS TRULY YOURS YOU MISTAKE ME GENEROUS PRINCE SAID SHE
THE LITTLE FIGURE NOW APPROACHED AND THROWING ASIDE HER VEIL HE BEHELD A MOST BEAUTIFUL WHITE CAT SHE SEEMED YOUNG AND MELANCHOLY AND ADDRESSING HERSELF TO THE PRINCE SHE SAID YOUNG PRINCE YOU ARE WELCOME
NOTHING COULD EXCEED HIS AFFLICTION WHEN HE HEARD THAT HIS ONLY CHILD WHEN BORN WAS TO BE GIVEN TO THE FAIRIES HE BORE IT HOWEVER AS WELL AS HE COULD FOR FEAR OF ADDING TO MY MOTHER'S GRIEF
AND WAS BESIDES A MIRACLE OF BEAUTY THE KING COULD NOT POSSIBLY HESITATE IN DECLARING HIS SATISFACTION YET AS HE WAS NOT MORE INCLINED THAN THE YEAR BEFORE TO PART WITH HIS CROWN
IN SHORT DEAR PRINCE CONTINUED THE LADY MY MOTHER INSTANTLY GOT OUT OF BED WAS DRESSED BY HER ATTENDANTS ENTERED THE PALACE AND SATISFIED HER LONGING
BUT THIS THEY TOOK CARE TO PREVENT SAYING MY LIFE SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR GREATER PUNISHMENT
THE FAIRIES PLACED ME IN A TOWER OF THEIR PALACE ELEGANTLY FURNISHED BUT TO WHICH THERE WAS NO DOOR SO THAT WHOEVER APPROACHED WAS OBLIGED TO COME BY THE WINDOWS WHICH WERE A GREAT HEIGHT FROM THE GROUND
IMAGINING HE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVE HIS PIECE OF CAMBRIC BUT WHAT WAS HIS ASTONISHMENT TO SEE NOTHING BUT A FILBERT HE DID NOT HOWEVER LOSE HIS HOPES HE CRACKED THE FILBERT AND IT PRESENTED HIM WITH A CHERRY STONE
THIS AT FIRST ALARMED ME BUT THE CHARMS OF HIS CONVERSATION HAD RESTORED ME TO TRANQUILLITY WHEN ALL AT ONCE THE WINDOW OPENED AND THE FAIRY VIOLENT MOUNTED ON THE DRAGON'S BACK RUSHED INTO THE TOWER
IN SHORT SHE WAS AT A LOSS ON NO SUBJECT WHATEVER SO THAT WHEN THE PRINCE WAS ALONE HE HAD PLENTY OF AMUSEMENT IN THINKING HOW IT COULD POSSIBLY BE THAT A SMALL WHITE CAT COULD BE ENDOWED WITH ALL THE POWERS OF HUMAN CREATURES
WHICH HAD BEEN DRESSED ON PURPOSE FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY HE ATE HEARTILY OF SUCH AS SHE RECOMMENDED WHEN SUPPER WAS OVER THE PRINCE PERCEIVED THAT THE WHITE CAT HAD A PORTRAIT SET IN GOLD HANGING TO ONE OF HER FEET
THE WHITE CAT WHO KNEW THE VERY DAY WHEN THE PRINCE WAS TO REACH HIS FATHER'S PALACE REMINDED HIM THAT HE HAD BUT THREE DAYS LONGER TO LOOK FOR A PERFECT LITTLE DOG THE PRINCE ASTONISHED AT HIS OWN FORGETFULNESS BEGAN TO AFFLICT HIMSELF
TWELVE HANDS IN THE AIR EACH HOLDING A TORCH THE PRINCE WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT HE DURST NOT MOVE A STEP WHEN HE FELT HIMSELF GENTLY PUSHED ON BY SOME OTHER HANDS FROM BEHIND HIM
AND SO RESPLENDENTLY LIGHTED WITH THOUSANDS OF LAMPS GIRANDOLES AND LUSTRES THAT THE PRINCE IMAGINED HE MUST BE IN AN ENCHANTED PALACE WHEN HE HAD PASSED THROUGH SIXTY APARTMENTS ALL EQUALLY SPLENDID
ATTEND YOU HERE YOU SHALL BREAK THE MAGIC SPELL THAT ON A BEAUTEOUS LADY FELL WELCOME PRINCE NO DANGER FEAR MIRTH AND LOVE ATTEND YOU HERE
PROVIDED YOU WILL GIVE US IN RETURN WHAT WE SHALL ASK AH KIND FAIRY CRIED THE QUEEN I WILL GIVE YOU ANYTHING I POSSESS EVEN MY VERY KINGDOMS ON CONDITION THAT I EAT OF YOUR FRUIT
SO THEY AGAIN TOOK LEAVE OF THE KING AND OF EACH OTHER AND SET OUT WITHOUT DELAY AND IN LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS OUR YOUNG PRINCE ARRIVED IN HIS SPLENDID CAR AT THE PALACE OF HIS DEAR WHITE CAT
AND HE AT LENGTH BOWED IN THE MOST RESPECTFUL MANNER WITHOUT DARING TO SPEAK FOR HE KNEW THAT I WAS IN THE PALACE OF THE FAIRIES WHEN IT BEGAN TO GROW DARK HE WENT AWAY
I HAVE IN MY PALACE SOME CATS THAT ARE PERFECTLY CLEVER IN MAKING SUCH CAMBRIC AS THE KING REQUIRES SO
MY BELOVED PRINCE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT HOW TO DEFEND ME FROM THEIR FURY
IT IS SO GRATIFYING TO THE HEART OF A FATHER TO RECEIVE PROOFS OF HIS CHILDREN'S LOVE AND OBEDIENCE
A YOUNG PRINCE THE PERFECT RESEMBLANCE OF HIM I HAD LOST SHOULD CUT OFF MY HEAD AND TAIL YOU ARE THAT PERFECT RESEMBLANCE AND ACCORDINGLY YOU HAVE ENDED THE ENCHANTMENT
BEAUTIFUL LADY HIS EYES HAD EVER SEEN STOOD BEFORE HIM AND BEFORE HE HAD SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE TO SPEAK TO HER A LONG TRAIN OF ATTENDANTS WHO AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THEIR MISTRESS WERE CHANGED TO THEIR NATURAL SHAPES
HE MADE A PRESENT OF THE LAST FOR TWENTY SERVANTS WOULD HAVE BEEN SCARCELY SUFFICIENT TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE DOGS HE WAS CONTINUALLY BUYING AT LENGTH WANDERING HE KNEW NOT WHITHER HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A FOREST
I PERCEIVED A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO WAS LISTENING TO OUR CONVERSATION AS I HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN BUT IN PICTURES I WAS NOT SORRY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF GRATIFYING MY CURIOSITY I THOUGHT HIM A VERY PLEASING OBJECT
WHEN LOOKING INTO THE COURT YARD HE SAW A SUPERB CAR ORNAMENTED ALL OVER WITH GOLD SILVER PEARLS AND DIAMONDS DRAWN BY TWELVE HORSES AS WHITE AS SNOW AND HARNESSED IN THE MOST SUMPTUOUS TRAPPINGS
VERY THING TO MAKE ME HAPPY SO THAT WITHOUT BESTOWING A PREFERENCE ON EITHER OF YOU I DECLARE THAT HE WHO BRINGS ME THE MOST PERFECT LITTLE DOG SHALL BE MY SUCCESSOR
AS THE WHITE CAT CONTINUALLY GAVE PROOFS OF AN EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING THE PRINCE WAS BY NO MEANS TIRED OF HER COMPANY SHE TALKED WITH HIM OF STATE AFFAIRS OF THEATRES OF FASHIONS
WHEN THE HUNTING WAS OVER THE WHOLE RETINUE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND THE WHITE CAT IMMEDIATELY EXCHANGED HER DRAGOON'S CAP FOR THE VEIL AND SAT DOWN TO SUPPER WITH THE PRINCE WHO BEING VERY HUNGRY ATE HEARTILY AND AFTERWARDS PARTOOK WITH HER
THAT YOU MUST BE AN EXTRAORDINARY CREATURE TO POSSESS WITH YOUR PRESENT FORM THE GIFT OF SPEECH AND THE MAGNIFICENT PALACE I HAVE SEEN
SHE HASTILY BADE HIM ADIEU NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE SNOW WHITE HORSES CONVEYED THIS FORTUNATE PRINCE TO HIS FATHER'S PALACE WHERE HIS BROTHERS HAD JUST ARRIVED BEFORE HIM THEY EMBRACED EACH OTHER
FROM THESE I HAD THE LIBERTY OF GETTING OUT INTO A DELIGHTFUL GARDEN IN WHICH WERE BATHS AND EVERY SORT OF COOLING FRUIT IN THIS PLACE
MAGNIFICENTLY FURNISHED THERE WAS IN IT A TABLE SPREAD FOR A REPAST AND EVERYTHING UPON IT WAS OF THE PUREST GOLD ADORNED WITH JEWELS THE PRINCE OBSERVED THERE WERE TWO COVERS SET AND WAS WONDERING
AND GO ALL TOGETHER WITH THEIR PRESENTS TO COURT THEY ALSO AGREED TO CHANGE THEIR NAMES THAT THEY MIGHT BE UNKNOWN TO EVERY ONE IN THEIR TRAVELS EACH TOOK A DIFFERENT ROAD BUT IT IS INTENDED TO RELATE THE ADVENTURES
HE DIVIDED IT AND FOUND IN THE MIDDLE A GRAIN OF WHEAT AND IN THAT GRAIN A MILLET SEED
RECEIVED HER WITH REJOICINGS AS IT WAS BEFORE IMAGINED SHE WOULD DIE OF DISAPPOINTMENT ALL THIS TIME THE QUEEN SAID NOTHING TO MY FATHER OF THE PROMISE SHE HAD MADE TO GIVE HER DAUGHTER TO THE FAIRIES SO THAT WHEN THE TIME WAS COME
BUSILY EMPLOYED IN PREPARING FOR THE FIELD FOR THIS WAS A DAY OF FESTIVAL PRESENTLY THE WHITE CAT CAME TO HIS APARTMENT AND HAVING POLITELY INQUIRED AFTER HIS HEALTH SHE INVITED HIM TO PARTAKE OF THEIR AMUSEMENT
WHO WAS TO BE HIS COMPANION WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS SUDDENLY CAUGHT BY A SMALL FIGURE NOT A FOOT HIGH WHICH JUST THEN ENTERED THE ROOM AND ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM IT HAD ON
THE KING FELT HE WAS GROWING OLD BUT AS HE FOUND HIMSELF AS CAPABLE OF GOVERNING AS HE HAD EVER BEEN HE HAD NO INCLINATION TO RESIGN HIS POWER AND THEREFORE THAT HE MIGHT PASS THE REST OF HIS DAYS PEACEABLY
AND HE WAS CONDUCTED BY THE HANDS TO HIS BEDCHAMBER WHICH WAS DIFFERENT STILL FROM ANY THING HE HAD SEEN IN THE PALACE BEING HUNG WITH THE WINGS OF BUTTERFLIES MIXED WITH THE MOST CURIOUS FEATHERS HIS BED WAS OF GAUZE
WHAT PITY THAT YOUR MAJESTY WHO IS SO CAPABLE OF GOVERNING SHOULD THINK OF RESIGNING THE CROWN I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE SIX KINGDOMS IN MY POSSESSION
THEN YOU WILL HAVE DONE ME A SERVICE I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE SUFFICIENTLY TO REPAY THE PRINCE'S EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AS SHE SPOKE YET HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF OBLIGED TO UNDERTAKE THE DREADFUL TASK
FOR HIM TO WASH HIS FACE AND HANDS AND AFTERWARDS TOOK OFF THE WRAPPING GOWN AND DRESSED HIM IN A SUIT OF CLOTHES OF STILL GREATER SPLENDOUR WHEN HIS DRESS WAS COMPLETE THEY CONDUCTED HIM TO AN APARTMENT HE HAD NOT YET SEEN
THE PRINCE NOW ADVANCED WITH CONFIDENCE WONDERING WHAT THESE WORDS COULD MEAN THE HANDS MOVED HIM FORWARD TOWARDS A LARGE DOOR OF CORAL WHICH OPENED OF ITSELF
YET AS THE WHITE CAT SIGHED AND LOOKED VERY SORROWFUL HE DID NOT VENTURE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS HE CONVERSED WITH HER ON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND FOUND HER EXTREMELY WELL VERSED IN EVERY THING THAT WAS PASSING IN THE WORLD WHEN NIGHT WAS FAR ADVANCED
AT THIS INSTANT HE FELT HIS HAND SCRATCHED BY THE CLAW OF A CAT UPON WHICH HE AGAIN TOOK COURAGE AND OPENING THE GRAIN OF MILLET SEED TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF ALL PRESENT
BUT THE CAT TOOK CARE TO REMIND THE PRINCE OF HIS DUTY IN PROPER TIME FOR ONCE MY PRINCE SAID SHE I WILL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF EQUIPPING YOU AS SUITS YOUR HIGH RANK
I RESOLVED TO FIND SOME MEANS OF ESCAPING FROM MY TOWER WITH THE ENGAGING PRINCE I HAD SEEN
EXCLAIMED ELIZABETH HOCKIN FANCY HER HAVIN THESE AND ME ONLY BRITANNIA METAL I RECKON SHE CAME OF A GOOD FAMILY SAID JABEZ LEASTWISE I'VE HEARD AS HOW SHE WERE ONCE WELL OFF AND LOOK HERE EXCLAIMED ELIZABETH
TOGETHER THEY HEAPED THE ARTICLES THAT HAD BELONGED TO AUNT JOANNA UPON THE FRESH GRAVE BUT AS THEY DID SO THE WIND CAUGHT THE LINEN AND UNFURLED AND FLAPPED IT AND THEY WERE FORCED TO PLACE STONES UPON IT TO HOLD IT DOWN
PEERED TIMOROUSLY INTO THE APARTMENT THAT SERVED MANY PURPOSES KITCHEN SITTING ROOM AND DINING PLACE THE MOONLIGHT POURED IN THROUGH THE BROAD LOW WINDOW BY IT THEY SAW A FIGURE
THOUGH IT WAS MID WINTER BUT WITH TERROR THEY DARED NOT ADVANCE AND THEY FELT POWERLESS TO RETREAT THEN THEY SAW AUNT JOANNA GO TO THE CUPBOARD OPEN IT AND RETURN WITH THE SILVER SPOONS
THERE'S FINE AND BEAUTIFUL LINEN UNDERNEATH
CURIOUS US SHOULD HA DREAMED ALIKE I DON'T KNOW THAT TWERE THE GIN MADE US DREAM AND US BOTH HAD GIN SO US DREAMED THE SAME THING TWERE MORE LIKE REAL TRUTH THAN DREAM OBSERVED ELIZABETH
AND MANTLES THEM IN SOFT WARM BROWN IN WINTER LIKE THE FUR OF AN ANIMAL IN ZENNOR IS A LITTLE CHURCH BUILT OF GRANITE RUDE AND SIMPLE OF CONSTRUCTION CROUCHING LOW TO AVOID THE GALES
SHE STOLE FROM THE COTTAGE AT NIGHT AND FOUND HER WAY TO SAINT IVES HER CONDUCT WAS REPREHENSIBLE CERTAINLY BUT THAT OF AUNT JOANNA WAS EVEN MORE SO
IT WOULD REALLY BE A SHAME TO SPOIL A PAIR AND WHERE ELSE COULD SHE GET SUCH FINE AND BEAUTIFUL OLD LINEN AS WAS THIS SO SHE PUT THE SHEETS AWAY AND FURNISHED FOR THE PURPOSE A CLEAN BUT COARSE AND RAGGED SHEET SUCH AS AUNT JOANNA HAD IN COMMON USE
SHE WEPT TEARS OF SYMPATHY WITH THE DECEASED AND HAPPINESS AT THE OVATION ACCORDED TO HERSELF AND HER HUSBAND AT LENGTH AS THE SHORT WINTER DAY CLOSED IN
HOW CAN YOU GET ABOUT AN THERE'S NO KNOWIN BUT YOU MIGHT BE TOOK BAD IN THE NIGHT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SOME LITTLE LASS WI YOU TO MIND YOU I DON'T WANT NOBODY THANK THE LORD
FOR AUNT JOANNA WAS VERY STRICT IN HER WESLEYANISM AND BITTERLY HOSTILE TO ALL SUCH CARNAL AMUSEMENTS AS DANCING AND PLAY ACTING OF THE LATTER THERE WAS NONE IN THAT WILD WEST CORNISH DISTRICT
DON'T BE SURE O THAT THESE BE TERRIBLE WICKED TIMES SAID THE HUSBAND AND I SEZ SEZ I NO HARM IS DONE IN SEEIN WHAT THE OLD CREETUR HAD GOT WELL SURELY ACQUIESCED ELIZABETH THERE IS NO HARM IN THAT
AND NOTICING HOW BENT AND FEEBLE JOANNA WAS SHE HALTED AND TALKED TO HER AND GAVE HER GOOD ADVICE SEE YOU NOW AUNTIE
NEITHER WOULD SUFFER THE SERVANT GIRL TO DESCEND TILL THEY HAD BEEN DOWN TO SEE IN WHAT CONDITION THE KITCHEN WAS THEY FOUND THAT THE TABLE HAD BEEN CLEARED THE COINS WERE ALL BACK IN THE TEAPOT
INTO SERVICE SHE DID NOT GO FOR WHEN ABRAHAM HEXT THE CARPENTER HEARD HOW SHE HAD BEEN TREATED HE AT ONCE PROPOSED AND IN THREE WEEKS MARRIED HER
AND I COULD BUY A COW I WANT ANOTHER CRUEL BAD AY WE DO TERRIBLE SAID ELIZABETH BUT JUST LOOK TO HER BED
NOW IT HAD SO HAPPENED THAT WHEN IT CAME TO THE LAYING OUT OF AUNT JOANNA MISSUS HOCKIN HAD LOOKED AT THE BEAUTIFUL LINEN SHEETS SHE HAD FOUND IN THE OAK CHEST WITH THE OBJECT OF FURNISHING THE CORPSE WITH ONE AS A WINDING SHEET
BUT LOOK HERE CRIED JABEZ
ALL ZENNOR DECLARED THAT THE HOCKINS WERE A MOST NEIGHBOURLY AND GENEROUS COUPLE WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT THEY TOOK UPON THEMSELVES TO DEFRAY THE FUNERAL EXPENSES MISSUS HEXT CAME TO THE FARM AND SAID THAT SHE WAS WILLING TO DO WHAT SHE COULD BUT MISSUS HOCKIN REPLIED
AND PROVIDE THAT HER BE DAYCENT BURIED THEM HEXTS BE IN A POOR WAY AND COULDN'T AFFORD THE EXPENSE AND IT DO SEEM TO ME ELIZABETH
HOW MANY COINS HOW MUCH MONEY WAS CAST THE COUPLE WERE IN NO MOOD TO ESTIMATE THEN THEY SAW THE HANDS COLLECT THE PILLOW CASES AND PROCEED TO ROLL UP THE TEAPOT AND SILVER SPOONS IN THEM AND THAT DONE
IN THE BEDROOM WAS AN OLD OAK CHEST AND THIS THE FARMER AND HIS WIFE OPENED TO THEIR SURPRISE THEY FOUND IN IT A SILVER TEAPOT AND HALF A DOZEN SILVER SPOONS
LAST WORDS HER SAID TO ME WAS THAT SHE'D HAVE NEVER NAUGHT TO DO WI THE HEXTS THEY AND ALL THEIR BELONGINGS THAT WAS HER LAST WORDS THE VERY LAST WORDS HER SPOKE TO ME OR TO ANYONE THEN SAID JABEZ
NEAR THIS MONUMENT OF A HOAR AND INDEED UNKNOWN ANTIQUITY LIVED AN OLD WOMAN BY HERSELF IN A SMALL COTTAGE OF ONE STORY IN HEIGHT
AND NO TEMPTATION EVER AFFORDED BY A STROLLING COMPANY SETTING UP ITS BOOTH WITHIN REACH OF ZENNOR BUT DANCING THOUGH DENOUNCED STILL DREW THE MORE INDEPENDENT SPIRITS TOGETHER
AND SHE WAS READY TO FORGIVE THE HARSH TREATMENT TO WHICH SHE HAD FINALLY BEEN SUBJECTED IN FACT SHE HAD REPEATEDLY MADE OVERTURES TO HER GREAT AUNT TO BE RECONCILED BUT THESE OVERTURES HAD BEEN ALWAYS REJECTED
THERE WAS NO DOOR AT THE BOTTOM BUT THE STAIRCASE WAS BOARDED UP AT THE SIDE IT OPENED INTO THE KITCHEN THEY DESCENDED VERY SOFTLY AND CAUTIOUSLY HOLDING EACH OTHER AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE BOTTOM
THE HANDS RETAINED THEM FOR A WHILE TILL THEY BELLIED WITH THE WIND AND THEN LET THEM GO AND THEY WERE SWEPT AWAY BY THE BLAST ACROSS THE CHURCHYARD OVER THE WALL AND LODGED IN THE CARPENTER'S YARD THAT ADJOINED AMONG HIS TIMBER
ROSE PENALUNA HAD BEEN WITH HER GREAT AUNT AFTER HER MOTHER'S DEATH SHE WAS A LIVELY GIRL AND WHEN SHE HEARD OF A DANCE AT SAINT IVES AND HAD BEEN ASKED TO GO TO IT ALTHOUGH FORBIDDEN BY AUNT JOANNA
AND A LONG ARM THAT STRETCHED ALONG THE GRAVE TILL IT REACHED THE OTHER SHEETS AT ONCE ON BEING RAISED THESE SHEETS WERE CAUGHT BY THE WIND AND FLAPPED AND FLUTTERED LIKE HALF HOISTED SAILS
BUT PRECISELY THE SAME SOUNDS WERE HEARD ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT
SO THE COUPLE FELT ABOUT THE FLOOR AND COLLECTED A NUMBER OF COINS WHAT THEY WERE THEY COULD NOT TELL TILL THEY REACHED THEIR HOME AND HAD LIGHTED A CANDLE HOW MUCH BE IT ASKED ELIZABETH
THE OLD WOMAN HAD TAKEN ONE OF THE FINE LINEN SHEETS OUT OF THE CUPBOARD IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN PLACED AND HAD SPREAD IT OVER THE LONG TABLE AND WAS SMOOTHING IT DOWN WITH HER BONY HANDS THE HOCKINS TREMBLED NOT WITH COLD
A HUGE SLAB OF UNWROUGHT STONE LIKE A TABLE POISED ON THE POINTS OF STANDING UPRIGHT BLOCKS AS RUDE AS THE MASS THEY SUSTAIN
WHO'LL GET THE SILVER TAYPOT AND SPOONS AND THE MONEY INQUIRED JABEZ HER HAD NO KIN NONE BUT ROSE HEXT AND HER COULDN'T ABIDE HER
AND SO ON THE PIECES WERE ROLLED AND RANGED THEMSELVES IN ORDER TEN IN A ROW THEN THE NEXT TEN WERE RUN ACROSS THE WHITE CLOTH IN THE SAME MANNER AND DROPPED OVER ON THEIR SIDES BELOW THE FIRST ROW
ALL AT THE EXPENSE OF THE HOCKINS AND THE CONVERSATION AMONG THOSE WHO ATTENDED AND ATE AND DRANK AND WIPED THEIR EYES WAS RATHER ANENT THE GENEROSITY OF THE HOCKINS THAN OF THE VIRTUES OF THE DEPARTED
AUNT JOANNA WAS GIVEN AN ELM AND NOT A MEAN DEAL BOARD COFFIN SUCH AS IS PROVIDED FOR PAUPERS AND A HANDSOME ESCUTCHEON OF WHITE METAL WAS PUT ON THE LID MOREOVER PLENTY OF GIN WAS DRUNK AND CAKE AND CHEESE EATEN AT THE HOUSE
AND YOU CAN'T GET ALL YOU WANT TAY AND SUGAR AND MILK FOR YOURSELF NOW IT WOULD BE HANDY TO HAVE A LITTLE MAID BY YOU WHO SHOULD I HAVE ASKED JOANNA WELL
THE NIGHT WAS SO DARK AND THE RAIN FELL SO HEAVILY THAT THEY COULD SEE NOTHING FOR FULL HALF AN HOUR BUT THEN THE CLOUDS WERE RENT ASUNDER AND THE MOON GLARED WHITE AND GHASTLY OVER THE CHURCHYARD ELIZABETH CAUGHT HER HUSBAND BY THE ARM AND POINTED
THEN QUAKING WITH FEAR THEY RETREATED TO THE CHURCH PORCH AND JABEZ UNCORKING THE BOTTLE FIRST TOOK A LONG PULL HIMSELF AND THEN PRESENTED IT TO HIS WIFE
AND NOW THE REFLECTION OF THE MOON ON THE LINEN SHEET WAS CAST UPON HER FACE AND THEY SAW THAT SHE WAS MOVING HER LIPS BUT NO SOUND ISSUED FROM THEM SHE THRUST HER HAND INTO THE TEAPOT AND DREW FORTH THE COINS ONE BY ONE
ROSE HAD NOT EXPECTED TO RECEIVE ANYTHING FROM HER AUNT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ALLOWED TO LOOK AT THE TREASURES IN THE OAK CHEST AS FAR AS SHE HAD BEEN AWARE AUNT JOANNA HAD BEEN EXTREMELY POOR BUT SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE OLD WOMAN HAD AT ONE TIME BEFRIENDED HER
ONE MAID WAS KEPT BUT NO MAN IN THE HOUSE ALL WERE WONT TO RETIRE EARLY TO BED NEITHER HOCKIN NOR HIS WIFE HAD LITERARY TASTES AND WERE NOT DISPOSED TO CONSUME MUCH OIL SO AS TO READ AT NIGHT
AND HAD TWO SLATES SET ON THE TOP TO PROTECT THE RISING SMOKE FROM BEING BLOWN DOWN THE CHIMNEY INTO THE COTTAGE WHEN THE WIND WAS FROM THE WEST OR FROM THE EAST WHEN HOWEVER IT DROVE FROM NORTH OR SOUTH
AND THIS WAS SEEN GROPING ABOUT THE GRASS TILL IT LAID HOLD OF THE TEAPOT THEN IT GROPED AGAIN AND GATHERED UP THE SPOONS THAT FLASHED IN THE MOONBEAMS NEXT UP CAME THE SECOND HAND
AND HER AGE AND TWO LINES OF A FAVOURITE HYMN OF HIS ALL ABOUT EARTH BEING NO DWELLING PLACE HEAVEN BEING PROPERLY HER HOME IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT ELIZABETH HOCKIN CRIED BUT SHE DID THIS DAY
AGAINST HER EXPRESS ORDERS IT WAS AT THIS DANCE THAT SHE HAD MET THE WHEELWRIGHT AND THIS MEETING AND THE TREATMENT THE GIRL HAD MET WITH FROM HER AUNT FOR HAVING GONE TO IT HAD LED TO THE MARRIAGE
THE LAST OF THOSE WHO HAD ATTENDED THE FUNERAL AND HAD RETURNED TO THE FARM TO RECRUIT AND REGALE AFTER IT DEPARTED AND THE HOCKINS WERE LEFT TO THEMSELVES
BUT WITH A TOWER THAT HAS DEFIED THE WINDS AND THE LASHING RAINS BECAUSE WHOLLY DEVOID OF SCULPTURED DETAIL WHICH WOULD HAVE AFFORDED THE BLASTS SOMETHING TO LAY HOLD OF AND EAT AWAY IN ZENNOR PARISH IS ONE OF THE FINEST CROMLECHS IN CORNWALL
VISITORS FROM SAINT IVES AND PENZANCE
HE'D HAVE A NEAT STONE ERECTED ABOVE THE GRAVE WITH WORK ON IT AT TWOPENCE A LETTER THE NAME AND THE DATE OF DEPARTURE OF AUNT JOANNA
SINCE THEN NO COMMUNICATION HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THE OLD WOMAN AND HER GRAND NIECE AS ROSE KNEW JOANNA WAS IMPLACABLE IN HER RESENTMENTS AND CONSIDERED THAT SHE HAD BEEN ACTING ARIGHT IN WHAT SHE HAD DONE
SHE PASSED THE COTTAGE BUT NO JOANNA WAS ABOUT THE DOOR WAS NOT OPEN AND USUALLY IT WAS ELIZABETH SPOKE ABOUT THIS TO HER HUSBAND JABEZ SAID SHE I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS O THIS
SAID ELIZABETH WE MUST RISK IT WHEN NIGHT HAD FALLEN MURK THE FARMER AND HIS WIFE CREPT FROM THEIR HOUSE CARRYING THE LINEN SHEETS THE TEAPOT AND THE SILVER SPOONS THEY DID NOT START TILL LATE FOR FEAR OF ENCOUNTERING ANY VILLAGERS ON THE WAY
AND POINTED ONLY WITH LIME IT WAS THATCHED WITH HEATHER AND POSSESSED BUT A SINGLE CHIMNEY THAT ROSE BUT LITTLE ABOVE THE APEX OF THE ROOF
WAS THE SUPPLY INEXHAUSTIBLE IT WAS NOT SO BUT APPARENTLY THE DEAD WOMAN DID NOT WEARY OF COUNTING THE COINS WHEN ALL HAD BEEN RANGED
TAKEN FROM THE SURFACE AND COMPOSED OF UNDISSOLVED ROOTS SUCH FUEL GIVES FLAME WHICH THE OTHER DOES NOT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT DOES NOT THROW OUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF HEAT NOR DOES IT LAST ONE HALF THE TIME
THREE POUNDS FIVE AND FOURPENCE AS I MAKE IT OUT
AND NOT TILL AFTER THE MAID SALLY HAD GONE TO BED THEY FASTENED THE FARM DOOR BEHIND THEM THE NIGHT WAS DARK AND STORMY WITH SCUDDING CLOUDS SO DENSE AS TO MAKE DEEP NIGHT WHEN THEY DID NOT PART AND ALLOW THE MOON TO PEER FORTH
THAT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO MOULDER IN THE GRAVE IT WOULD BE POSITIVELY SINFUL BECAUSE WASTEFUL TO GIVE UP TO CORRUPTION AND THE WORM SUCH FINE WHITE LINEN AS AUNT JOANNA HAD HOARDED THE FUNERAL WAS CONDUCTED OTHERWISE LIBERALLY
WE'LL DO SO BUT I HOPE IT'S NOT WHAT MISSUS HOCKIN DID NOT ANSWER SHE AND HER HUSBAND CREPT FROM BED AND TREADING ON TIPTOE ACROSS THE ROOM DESCENDED THE STAIR
NEXT THE HANDS BEGAN TO TRIFLE WITH THE TEAPOT AND TO SHAKE OUT SOME OF THE COINS IN A MINUTE SOME SILVER PIECES WERE FLUNG WITH SO TRUE AN AIM THAT THEY FELL CLINKING DOWN ON THE FLOOR OF THE PORCH
THEN THE SMOKE MUST TAKE CARE OF ITSELF ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS WONT TO FIND ITS WAY OUT OF THE DOOR AND LITTLE OR NONE WENT UP THE CHIMNEY THE ONLY FUEL BURNT IN THIS COTTAGE WAS PEAT
AND THAT AND THE SPOONS WERE WHERE THEY HAD THEMSELVES PLACED THEM THE SHEET MOREOVER WAS NEATLY FOLDED AND REPLACED WHERE IT HAD BEEN BEFORE THE HOCKINS DID NOT SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER OF THEIR EXPERIENCES DURING THE PAST NIGHT SO LONG AS THEY WERE IN THE HOUSE
BUT THE GOLDEN FURZE OR GORSE DEFIES ALL WINDS AND CLOTHES THE MOORLAND WITH A ROBE OF SPLENDOUR AND THE HEATHER FLUSHES THE SLOPES WITH CRIMSON TOWARDS THE DECLINE OF SUMMER
NO IT'S VIRTUE IT'S WARMER NOR GIN A LONG SIGHT GIN GIVES A SMOULDERING SPARK BUT A GOOD CONSCIENCE IS A BLAZE OF FURZE THE FARM OF THE HOCKINS WAS SMALL AND HOCKIN LOOKED AFTER HIS CATTLE HIMSELF
AND AS HER EXPRESSED HERSELF THAT STRONG WHY US AS HONEST FOLKS
THERE HER BE DEAD AS A DRIED PILCHARD AND IN FACT AUNTIE JOANNA HAD DIED IN THE NIGHT AFTER HAVING SO CONFIDENTLY AFFIRMED HER CONVICTION THAT SHE WOULD LIVE TO THE AGE OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN WHATIVER SHALL WE DO
SHE WAS ACCORDINGLY NOT SURPRISED TO LEARN FROM MISSUS HOCKIN THAT THE OLD WOMAN'S LAST WORDS HAD BEEN AS REPORTED BUT ALTHOUGH DISOWNED AND DISINHERITED ROSE HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN DRESSED IN BLACK AND WERE CHIEF MOURNERS AT THE FUNERAL
AND IT'S A FINE PROVERB I FEELS IT IN MY INSIDES
AND THEY COULD NOT DISTINGUISH THE FEATURES NOR NOTE THE EXPRESSION WITH WHICH SHE REGARDED THEM PRESENTLY SHE WENT BACK TO THE CUPBOARD AND RETURNED WITH THE SILVER TEAPOT SHE STOOD AT ONE END OF THE TABLE
THE NEAREST FARM TO AUNT JOANNA'S COTTAGE WAS OCCUPIED BY THE HOCKINS ONE DAY ELIZABETH THE FARMER'S WIFE SAW THE OLD WOMAN OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE AS SHE WAS HERSELF RETURNING FROM MARKET
THE SOIL DOES NOT LIE DEEP OVER GRANITE THAT PEERS THROUGH THE SURFACE ON EXPOSED SPOTS WHERE THE FURIOUS GALES FROM THE OCEAN SWEEP THE LAND IF TREES EVER EXISTED THERE THEY HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE BLAST
IN THE LAND'S END DISTRICT IS THE LITTLE CHURCH TOWN OF ZENNOR THERE IS NO VILLAGE TO SPEAK OF A FEW SCATTERED FARMS AND HERE AND THERE A CLUSTER OF COTTAGES THE DISTRICT IS BLEAK
THE WOMAN WHO LIVED IN THE COTTAGE WAS CALLED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AUNT JOANNA WHAT HER FAMILY NAME WAS BUT FEW REMEMBERED NOR DID IT CONCERN HERSELF MUCH SHE HAD NO RELATIONS AT ALL
ASKED MISSUS HOCKIN I RECKON SAID HER HUSBAND US HAD BETTER TAKE AN INVENTORY OF WHAT IS HERE LEST WICKED RASCALS COME IN AND STEAL ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING
DURING THE NIGHT AT WHAT TIME SHE DID NOT KNOW MISSUS HOCKIN AWOKE WITH A START AND FOUND THAT HER HUSBAND WAS SITTING UP IN BED LISTENING THERE WAS A MOON THAT NIGHT AND NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY
SAID JABEZ AY RESPONDED ELIZABETH AND WHAT A SIGHT O PEOPLE CAME HERE THIS HERE BURYIN OF AUNT JOANNA HAVE SET US UP TREMENDOUS IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE NEIGHBOURS I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO ELSE WOULD HA DONE IT FOR A POOR OLD CREETUR AS IS NO RELATION AY
AND SEE THAT NONE OF ALL HER SAVINGS GO TO THEM DARNED AND DRATTED HEXTS BUT WHO BE THEY TO GO TO THEN WELL WE'LL SEE FUST
AND IT'S BUTTER I'VE LET HER HAVE NOW AND THEN IN A LIBERAL WAY
THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKING IT IT WAS THAT OF AUNT JOANNA CLOTHED IN THE TATTERED SHEET THAT ELIZABETH HOCKIN HAD ALLOWED FOR HER GRAVE CLOTHES
SHE PLACED ALL SIX ON THE SHEET AND WITH A LEAN FINGER COUNTED THEM SHE TURNED HER FACE TOWARDS THOSE WHO WERE WATCHING HER PROCEEDINGS BUT IT WAS IN SHADOW
NOT TILL NEAR DAYBREAK DID THIS SOUND CEASE AND NOT TILL THE MAID SALLY HAD BEGUN TO STIR IN THE INNER BEDCHAMBER DID HOCKIN AND HIS WIFE VENTURE TO RISE
FOR WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT THE GIRL HAD LEFT THE HOUSE SHE BARRED HER DOOR AND REFUSED TO ALLOW ROSE TO RE ENTER IT THE POOR GIRL HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO TAKE REFUGE THE SAME NIGHT AT THE NEAREST FARM AND SLEEP IN AN OUTHOUSE
MISTER AND MISSUS HOCKIN HEARD THIS AND THEIR HEARTS SWELLED WITHIN THEM NOTHING SO SWELLS THE HEART AS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF VIRTUE BEING RECOGNISED
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A GRAND NIECE WHO WAS MARRIED TO A SMALL TRADESMAN A WHEELWRIGHT NEAR THE CHURCH BUT JOANNA AND HER GREAT NIECE WERE NOT ON SPEAKING TERMS THE GIRL HAD MORTALLY OFFENDED THE OLD WOMAN BY GOING TO A DANCE AT SAINT IVES
US IS THE CLOSEST NEIGHBOURS
SHE WENT INDOORS AND SHUT THE DOOR
HALF AN HOUR ELAPSED BEFORE THE MOON SHONE OUT AGAIN THEN THE HOCKINS SAW THAT NOTHING WAS STIRRING IN THE CEMETERY I RECKON US MAY GO NOW SAID JABEZ LET US GATHER UP WHAT SHE CHUCKED TO US ADVISED ELIZABETH
I'VE KEPT MY EYE OPEN AND THERE BE NO AUNTIE JOANNA HOPPIN ABOUT
I RECKON SAID HOCKIN WE'LL BIDE IN THE PORCH AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY BE LEFT THERE TILL MORNIN WHY WE MAY CARRY EM BACK WI AN EASY CONSCIENCE WE'VE SPENT SOME POUNDS OVER HER BURYIN WHAT HAVE IT COME TO
THERE WAS NO SLEEP FOR THEM THAT NIGHT IN THE GLOOM WHEN THE MOON WAS CONCEALED IN THE GLARE WHEN IT SHONE FORTH IT WAS THE SAME
NEVER CHARGED HER A PENNY THINKING HER COULDN'T AFFORD IT BUT HER COULD
THEY WALKED TIMOROUSLY AND SIDE BY SIDE LOOKING ABOUT THEM AS THEY PROCEEDED AND ON REACHING THE CHURCHYARD GATE THEY HALTED TO PLUCK UP COURAGE BEFORE OPENING AND VENTURING WITHIN
I RECKON IT'S THE OLD LADY BE DOWN REPLIED HER HUSBAND AND THROWING OPEN THE BEDROOM DOOR HE SAID
AND ROLLED THEM ALONG THE TABLE THE HOCKINS SAW THE GLINT OF THE METAL AND THE SHADOW CAST BY EACH PIECE OF MONEY AS IT ROLLED THE FIRST COIN LODGED AT THE FURTHER LEFT HAND CORNER AND THE SECOND RESTED NEAR IT
MY GOOD ROSE IT'S NO GOOD I SEED YOUR AUNT WHEN HER WAS AILIN AND NIGH ON DEATH AND HER LAID IT ON ME SOLEMN AS COULD BE THAT WE WAS TO BURY HER AND THAT SHE'D HAVE NOTHIN TO DO WI THE HEXTS AT NO PRICE ROSE SIGHED AND WENT AWAY
THE WHITE BUNDLE WAS CAST INTO THE AIR AND CAUGHT BY THE WIND AND CARRIED OVER THE CHURCHYARD WALL INTO THE WHEELWRIGHT'S YARD AT ONCE A CURTAIN OF VAPOUR RUSHED ACROSS THE FACE OF THE MOON AND AGAIN THE GRAVEYARD WAS BURIED IN DARKNESS
SHE'S A HANDY MAID
NO SMOKE ISSUED FROM THE CHIMNEY AND THE DOOR WAS SHUT JABEZ KNOCKED BUT THERE CAME NO ANSWER SO HE ENTERED FOLLOWED BY HIS WIFE THERE WAS IN THE COTTAGE BUT THE KITCHEN WITH ONE BEDROOM AT THE SIDE THE HEARTH WAS COLD
AND NOW DOWN CAME A TEARING RAIN DRIVEN BY A BLAST FROM THE ATLANTIC HOWLING AMONG THE GRAVESTONES AND SCREAMING IN THE BATTLEMENTS OF THE TOWER AND ITS BELL CHAMBER WINDOWS
IT'S OUR MORAL DOOTY TO ABIDE BY THE WISHES OF AUNT JOANNA
THERE ARE A GREAT MANY SHE ASSURED ME IT WAS TO GET AWAY FROM THEM AS MUCH AS ANYTHING THAT I CAME OVER WITH FATHER ON THIS BUSINESS TRIP BUSINESS TRIP I GROANED
THAT LITTLE DIAMOND CHARM OF MINE HAS SLIPPED OFF MY FOB I SAW IT AS WE CROSSED THE FOYER FROM THE RESTAURANT WHY WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO US ALL MY SISTER JOINED IN
TOO LARGE TO LOSE ANYWAY I REMARKED CHEERFULLY AS I JOINED IN THE SEARCH WE PULLED ASIDE A TABLE AND I ALMOST COLLIDED WITH ONE OF MY MOST DISTINGUISHED GUESTS SIR BLAYDON HARRISON K C B
WITHOUT HAT OR COAT I JUMPED INTO A TAXI AND IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES I WAS MOUNTING THE STAIRS OF NUMBER SEVENTEEN BANTON STREET WITH THE HALL PORTER BLINKING AT ME FROM HIS OFFICE I SCARCELY WENT THROUGH THE FORMALITY OF KNOCKING AT THE DOOR MISTER PARKER AND EVE WERE BOTH STANDING AT THE TABLE
IT'S USUAL AMONG ENGAGED COUPLES I PLEADED IS IT SHE REMARKED COLDLY DOESN'T THE MAN AS A RULE WAIT TO BE QUITE SURE HE IS ENGAGED NOT IN THIS COUNTRY I DECLARED
I FOUND LADY ENTERDEAN PEERING ABOUT WITH HER LORGNETTE FIXED TO HER EYES APPARENTLY SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING LOST ANYTHING LADY ENTERDEAN I ASKED
THEIR HEADS CLOSE TOGETHER AT THE SOUND OF MY FOOTSTEPS AND PRECIPITATE ENTRANCE MISTER PARKER SWUNG ROUND ONE HAND WAS STILL BEHIND HIM UPON THE TABLE A WHITE SILK HANDKERCHIEF WAS LYING MY DEAR FELLOW HE EXCLAIMED
OR IT MAY NOT BY THE BY WHERE DID YOU MEET THEM IF YOU DON'T MIND I ANSWERED WE WON'T DISCUSS THEM ANY LONGER AT LEAST REGGIE INSISTED WILL YOU TELL ME THIS
I CORRECTED MYSELF HASTILY THAT I HAVE OFFERED TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH YOU AND YOUR FATHER IN ANY OF YOUR ENTERPRISES I AM PERFECTLY WILLING TO GIVE UP ANYTHING IN LIFE YOU MAY CONSIDER TOO RESPECTABLE AT THE SAME TIME I MUST SAY
I MADE UP A RUBBER OF BRIDGE CHIEFLY WITH THE IDEA OF DISTRACTING MY THOUGHTS PRESENTLY WHILE MY PARTNER WAS PLAYING THE HAND I ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM TO THE SIDEBOARD FOR SOME CIGARETTES
I FELT COMPLETELY AT MY WIT'S END I SAW THE WHOLE OF MY LITTLE SCHEME WHICH UP TO NOW HAD PROVED SO SUCCESSFUL THREATENED WITH INSTANT DESTRUCTION LADY ENTERDEAN PASSED ON PROBABLY TO TAKE SOME ONE ELSE INTO HER CONFIDENCE
FORTUNATELY FOR ME PERHAPS I CAUGHT EVE'S EYE IN WHICH THERE WAS MORE THAN THE SUSPICION OF A TWINKLE I CHOSE THEREFORE THE LATTER ALTERNATIVE MISTER MOSS WATCHED US FOR A MOMENT CURIOUSLY
SHE HELD UP HER FINGER THE DOOR WAS QUIETLY OPENED MISTER PARKER ENTERED HE WAS FOLLOWED BY THE MOST UTTERLY OBJECTIONABLE AND REPULSIVE LOOKING PERSON I HAVE EVER SET EYES ON IN MY LIFE A YOUNG MAN THIN
ON THE BACK OF A PLAIN VISITING CARD WERE A FEW HASTY WORDS SCRAWLED IN PENCIL SO SORRY BUT EVE IS NOT FEELING QUITE HERSELF AND BEGGED ME TO TAKE HER HOME AT ONCE QUIETLY MY RESPECTS AND APOLOGIES TO YOU AND ALL YOUR DELIGHTFUL GUESTS
MISTER MOSS LOOKED A LITTLE PUZZLED HE MEANS LAGGED DON'T HE HE REMARKED A LIGHT BREAKING IN ON HIM
AND BROACHED THE SUBJECT OF REGGIE'S VISIT AS DELICATELY AS I COULD YOU REMEMBER LORD REGGIE SIDLEY I ASKED LORD REGGIE WHAT EVE EXCLAIMED SIDLEY I REPEATED FIRMLY
MISTER PARKER'S EXPRESSION HAD NEVER BEEN SO BOYISH SO EARNEST AND YET SO WISTFUL EVE WAS QUIVERING WITH SOME EMOTION THE NATURE OF WHICH I COULD NOT AT ONCE DIVINE I FELT VERY CERTAIN HOWEVER
WHAT ABOUT THEM I WANT THEIR ADDRESS OF COURSE REGGIE CONTINUED
CONSIDERING THAT HE HAS HAD TWELVE YEARS CONTINUAL WORK I THINK YOU'LL ALL AGREE WITH ME THAT HIS IS A WONDERFUL RECORD HE HAS BEEN COMPELLED TO ENTER INTO A LITTLE INVOLUNTARY ER RETIREMENT ONLY ONCE DURING THE WHOLE OF THAT TIME
AND THE OLD EARL OF ENTERDEAN MY GODFATHER AND THEY WERE BOTH OF THEM OBVIOUSLY HER ABJECT SLAVES NO ONE SEEMED IN THE LEAST INCLINED TO MOVE AND IT WAS NEARLY ELEVEN O'CLOCK BEFORE WE PASSED INTO THE PRIVATE ROOM I HAD ENGAGED
HE ESSAYED APOLOGETICALLY TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I REALLY HADN'T MEANT NEVER MIND WHAT YOU MEANT I INTERRUPTED PLEASE GIVE ME THOSE THINGS BACK AGAIN AT ONCE
ONE OF THE NEATEST PIECES OF BUSINESS I EVER DID IN MY LIFE I BROUGHT OFF THERE IN THE OLD BAR TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I'M GETTING A BIT PECKISH THERE IS NO REASON MISTER PARKER AGREED WHY WE SHOULD NOT DINE AT ONCE
REGGIE PICKED UP HIS HAT THERE IS SOMETHING MORE IN THIS HE SAID DIDACTICALLY THAN MEETS THE EYE MACHIAVELLIAN I SCOFFED BE OFF REGGIE I HAD TEA WITH EVE THAT AFTERNOON
I SAID NOT A WORD I LOOKED AT THEM AND I LOOKED AT MISTER PARKER HE SMILED WEAKLY AND SCRATCHED HIS CHIN I DIDN'T DO SO BADLY
I PASSED MY ARM THROUGH HIS AND LED HIM OUT TOWARD THE FOYER YOU SEEM I DECLARED BITTERLY TO HAVE CHOSEN THE MOST UNFORTUNATE PERSONALITY I WISH TO GOODNESS YOU HAD REMAINED MISTER PARKER
I SHALL MAKE A POINT OF CALLING ON THEM MYSELF TOMORROW NOW PAUL YOU MUST GO AND PLAY BRIDGE THEY ARE WAITING FOR YOU DON'T BOTHER ABOUT ME I'LL AMUSE MYSELF QUITE WELL STROLLING ROUND AND TALKING TO MY FRIENDS
HE IS ONE FOR THE GAB AIN'T HE HE REMARKED CONFIDENTIALLY TO ME FOR THE LIFE OF ME AT THAT MOMENT I COULD NOT TELL WHETHER TO LEAVE THE ROOM IN A FIT OF ANGRY DISGUST OR TO ACCEPT THE LUDICROUS SIDE OF THE SITUATION AND LAUGH
I READ IT OUT AND PASSED IT TO REGGIE HIS FACE FELL
THAT SHE HAD BEEN REMONSTRATING WITH HER FATHER DON'T KEEP US IN SUSPENSE MY DEAR FELLOW MISTER PARKER IMPLORED WHAT HAS GONE WRONG EVE AND I WERE JUST JUST TALKING OVER
BETWEEN YOU AND ME HE WENT ON DON'T GIVE IT AWAY OUTSIDE THIS ROOM YOU KNOW BUT THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS GOING ABOUT CONCERNING AN AMERICAN AND HIS PRETTY DAUGHTER OVER HERE REGULAR WRONG UNS
LADY ENTERDEAN EXCLAIMED HOW RELIEVED I FEEL MOST SATISFACTORY I AM SURE SHE SAT DOWN PROMPTLY THERE WAS A LITTLE MURMUR OF VOICES MY GUESTS GATHERED ROUND ME I DREW A LONG BREATH

REGGIE IS IN TOWN JUST FOR A FEW DAYS
I ASKED SHE SHOOK HER HEAD
IT DOESN'T SOUND VERY AMUSING FOR ME SHE OBJECTED HOW MUCH SHOULD WE MAKE THOUSANDS I ASSURED HER IF IT WERE PROPERLY ENGINEERED I THINK SHE SAID REFLECTIVELY
CHAPTER SIX THE PARTY AT THE MILAN THE DINNER PARTY WHICH I ARRANGED FOR IN THE MILAN RESTAURANT WAS ON THE WHOLE A GREAT SUCCESS MY SISTER PLAYED HOSTESS FOR ME
I AM EXCEEDINGLY SORRY YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD ANY ANXIETY BUT ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL I WOUND UP WEAKLY EVERY ONE WAS TALKING CHEERFULLY THE GREAT TOPIC NOW WAS ONE OF ETHICS

MISTER AND MISSUS SAMUELSON WERE BEING ENTERTAINED BY SOME FRIENDS CLOSE AT HAND AND THEY APPEARED VERY MUCH GRATIFIED AT THE CORDIALITY OF OUR GREETING I TALKED WITH MISTER SAMUELSON DURING THE EVENING AND I FELT THAT SO FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED AT ANY RATE

WELL THAT GOES ALL RIGHT MISTER PARKER REMARKED COMPLACENTLY WE'RE GETTING THE CREDIT FOR IT PRECISELY I ADMITTED THE ONLY TROUBLE IS THAT LADY ENTERDEAN HAS JUST TELEPHONED TO HER SON TO COME DOWN AT ONCE
BUT REALLY YOU KNOW NO PEOPLE OUGHT TO CARRY ABOUT THEIR VALUABLES LIKE THAT IT WAS TRYING US A LITTLE TOO HIGH WASN'T IT AND DEAR REGGIE DID HE ARRIVE FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS REALLY ANGRY WITH EVE

AND HAVE MIXED WITH RESPECTABLE PEOPLE ALL YOUR LIFE SHE EXCLAIMED ALL THE SAME LET ME TELL YOU THERE ARE PLENTY OF CHARMING AND DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE GOING ABOUT THE WORLD EARNING THEIR LIVING BY THEIR WITS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE FORCED TO
MISTER MOSS SMILED DEPRECATINGLY AND JERKED HIS HEAD SIDEWAYS
BUT I TOLD HIM MISTER BUNDERCOMBE AND HIS DAUGHTER WERE HERE AND HE IS RUSHING INTO HIS CLOTHES AS FAST AS HE CAN
AND LOOKING OVER THE SPOILS I SAID GRIMLY I WENT A LITTLE FARTHER INTO THE ROOM MISTER PARKER WITH A SIGH ABANDONED HIS POSITION

AND THAT FOR A TRIFLING BEANO A LADY'S BAG AND A COUPLE OF WIPES
PAUL DID YOU GIVE US TOO MUCH TO DRINK OR WHAT I AM NOT SURE THAT THIS WAS NOT THE MOST AWFUL MOMENT OF MY LIFE A COLD SHIVER OF FEAR SUDDENLY SEIZED ME I LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER SPEECHLESS
THE PROFESSION AIN'T WHAT IT WAS YOU WILL COME WITH US WON'T YOU MISTER WALMSLEY EVE BEGGED TURNING TO ME I SHALL BE DELIGHTED I ANSWERED WITH STRENUOUS MENDACITY DID YOU SAY STEPHANO'S OR WHAT

KIND OF WARM OUT HERE HE REMARKED I'LL JUST HAVE TO TALK TO EVE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO HE HAD NO SOONER LEFT ME THAN I FOUND I WAS ABSOLUTELY COMPELLED TO DEVOTE MYSELF TO ONE OR TWO OF MY GUESTS WHO WISHED TO PLAY BRIDGE
HE SAYS THE MARKET OVER HERE FOR SUCH LITTLE TRIFLES AS WE HAVE COME ACROSS IS VERY RESTRICTED I GROANED UNDER MY BREATH IN IMAGINATION I COULD SEE MISTER PARKER BARTERING WITH SOME SHADY INDIVIDUAL FOR LADY ENTERDEAN'S CAMEO BROOCH
HE UNCLOSED THE FINGERS OF HIS HAND AND REMOVED THE SILK HANDKERCHIEF I SAW UPON THE TABLE MY AUNT'S BROOCH MY SISTER'S PENDANT AND SIR BLAYDON HARRISON'S DIAMOND PIG
IF APPEARANCES HAD GONE FOR ANYTHING AT THAT MOMENT
I CROSSED THE ROOM TO THE LITTLE GROUP SURROUNDING MY FRIEND AND AS SOON AS I GOT NEAR HIM I TOUCHED HIM ON THE SHOULDER JUST ONE WORD WITH YOU MISTER BUNDERCOMBE I BEGGED THE LITTLE CIRCLE OF MEN LET HIM THROUGH WITH RELUCTANCE
SIR BLAYDON ALSO WITH AN EYEGLASS IN HIS EYE WAS MOVING DISCONTENTEDLY BACKWARD AND FORWARD KICKING THE CARPET SILLY THING HE OBSERVED AS HE GLANCED UP FOR A MOMENT
WHERE COFFEE AND SOME BRIDGE TABLES AWAITED US WE BROKE UP THERE INTO LITTLE GROUPS I LEFT EVE TALKING TO MY SISTER AND WAS ON MY WAY TO TRY TO GET NEAR HER FATHER
HE HAS BEEN ROUND TO SEE ME THIS MORNING I TOLD HER WANTED YOUR ADDRESS SHE SIGHED LONDON WILL BE GETTING TOO HOT FOR US SOON SHE MURMURED AM I ENGAGED TO HIM OR ANYTHING
WHEN THE COUNTESS OF ENTERDEAN A PERFECTLY CHARMING OLD LADY WHO HAD KNOWN ME FROM BOYHOOD INTERCEPTED ME MY DEAR PAUL SHE SAID
I WILL DO IT AGAIN IF YOU LIKE PRAY DON'T SHE BEGGED YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TELL ME ARE YOU SHE ADDED LOOKING AT ME WITH WIDE OPEN EYES
PERSONALLY I MUST ADMIT THAT THE NERVE AND ACTUAL GENIUS REQUIRED IN FINGER MANIPULATION HAVE ALWAYS ATTRACTED ME MISTER MOSS PAUSED WITH HIS GLASS HALFWAY TO HIS LIPS HE JERKED HIS HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF MISTER PARKER
I AM DELIGHTED TO SAY I HAVE RECOVERED
CHEERO HE SAID BRIGHTLY AS HE SEATED HIMSELF IN MY EASY CHAIR AND TAPPED THE END OF ONE OF MY CIGARETTES UPON THE TABLECLOTH I HAVEN'T BEEN UP SO EARLY FOR MONTHS BUT
JUST A LITTLE EARLY DINNER SAY AT STEPHANO'S JUST AS WE ARE YOU KNOW WILL THIS BE AGREEABLE TO YOU CERTAINLY EVE ASSENTED PROMPTLY MISTER MOSS WILL TELL US SOME OF HIS LITTLE ADVENTURES MISTER PARKER CONTINUED WITH SATISFACTION
I'M HANGED IF I UNDERSTAND THIS REGGIE REMARKED LOOKING AT ME SUSPICIOUSLY WHY
HE CONFESSED DIRECTLY HE WAS QUESTIONED HE HAS RESTORED EVERYTHING AND I THOUGHT IT BEST TO HAVE HIM SIMPLY TURNED OFF WITHOUT ANY FUSS HERE IS YOUR PIG SIR BLAYDON YOUR PENDANT BLANCHE YOUR BROOCH LADY ENTERDEAN
EVIDENTLY I WAS ONLY JUST IN TIME THE RUBBER OF BRIDGE HAD BEEN BROKEN UP AND MY GUESTS WERE STANDING ABOUT IN LITTLE GROUPS TALKING I CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND ME AND HELD UP MY HAND BLANCHE I ANNOUNCED LADY ENTERDEAN
THIS INFERNAL NAME OF YOURS BUNDERCOMBE HAS GOT US INTO TROUBLE IN WHAT WAY HE ASKED QUICKLY
NONE I REPLIED I PUT IT ALL ON TO A WAITER HOW CLEVER OF YOU YOU REALLY DO SEEM TO BE A MOST CAPABLE PERSON AND SO MASTERFUL I BEGIN TO FEAR THAT SOME DAY YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY
AND SHE NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT ANY OF THEM COMING OVER THEY SEEM TO HAVE MADE THEIR MINDS UP ALL OF A SUDDEN I EXPLAINED THEY SPOKE OF IT AS QUITE A FLYING TRIP REGGIE COUGHED AND STARED FOR A MOMENT AT THE END OF HIS BOOT
HE ASKED AS HE SET DOWN HIS GLASS
FINE APPEARANCE FOR THE JOB HE ADDED ADMIRINGLY EVE SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO LAUGH SOFTLY TO HERSELF SHE HAD A HABIT OF LAUGHING ALMOST ALTOGETHER WITH HER EYES IN A WAY THAT EXPRESSED MORE GENUINE ENJOYMENT
THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER REALIZED SHE ROCKED HERSELF GENTLY BACKWARD AND FORWARD MISTER MOSS LOOKED AT US BOTH A LITTLE SUSPICIOUSLY SEEM TO BE MISSING THE JOKE A BIT I DO HE REMARKED EVE SAT UP AND WAS INSTANTLY GRAVE
IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I SAID I WILL PURSUE THIS CONVERSATION TO MORROW MORNING I TORE DOWNSTAIRS JUMPED INTO THE WAITING TAXI AND RETURNED TO THE MILAN I ENTERED THE PRIVATE ROOM WITH A GRAVE FACE
TO WATCH MISTER MOSS AT WORK THIS AFTERNOON AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT A MORE CONSUMMATE ARTIST I HAVE NEVER SEEN

I POINTED OUT IF I HAVEN'T SHE ASSURED ME IT HAS BEEN SIMPLY TO SAVE YOUR FEELINGS I GULPED DOWN A LITTLE RISING STORM OF INDIGNATION
IT IS YOUR CLEAR SIGHTED WAY OF PUTTING THINGS SHE EXPLAINED SOFTLY YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND PEOPLE SO THOROUGHLY I DON'T GENERALLY MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THE NUMBER OF BEANS IN THE GAME MISTER MOSS OBSERVED IN A SELF CONGRATULATORY TONE
HER EYES LAUGHED AT ME THERE WAS SOMETHING SOFTLY PROVOCATIVE IN THEM A NEW AND KINDER LIGHT I BENT OVER HER AND KISSED HER SHE SAT QUITE STILL MISTER WALMSLEY
NOT A SHADOW OF SUSPICION REMAINED IN HIS MIND AS TO MY TWO GUESTS WE SAT A LONG TIME OVER DINNER EVE WAS BETWEEN A COUSIN OF MINE WHO WAS A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT A MASTER OF FOXHOUNDS AND IN HIS WAY QUITE A DISTINGUISHED PERSON
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE CODE OF MORALS YOU KNOW I FLATTER MYSELF THAT AT THIS POINT I WAS TACTFUL MY DEAR EVE I REMINDED HER YOU FORGET THAT I HAVE JOINED THE GANG I MEAN
MY DEAR WALMSLEY WHAT HAS HAPPENED I OPENED MY LIPS AND CLOSED THEM AGAIN IT REALLY SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY ANYTHING

THE YOUNG MAN I CONTINUED WILL BE HERE IN TEN MINUTES PERHAPS SOONER PREPARED TO GRASP YOU BOTH BY THE HAND AND EXCHANGE REMINISCENCES MISTER PARKER SHOOK OUT A WHITE SILK HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS POCKET AND MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD
AMIDST SUCH THOUGHTS HE CAME INTO THE WOOD AND MADE HIS WAY BY THE PATHS AND OPEN PLACES GOING SOUTH AND EAST OF THE HOUSE WHEREAS THE LAST DAY HE HAD GONE WEST AND NORTH HE WENT A SOFT PACE BUT WANDERED ON WITHOUT ANY STAY TILL IT WAS NOON
ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD SO THAT THE YOUNG MAN OF UPMEADS COULD NOT STAND UP UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE BLOW BUT FELL TO THE EARTH SWOONING AND THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN KNELT ON HIM AND DREW OUT AN ANLACE SHORT THICK AND SHARP AND CRIED OUT
AND THE GUARDIAN OF ALL POOR FOLK ASK THE CARLES ELSE RALPH HELD HIS PEACE AND ROSE TO BE GONE AND TURNING SAW THE DAMSEL WADING THE SHALLOW FORD AND LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER AT HIM HE GAVE THE DAME GOOD DAY
AND STILL IS SO THAT NEVER BUT ONCE WILT THOU BE NIGHER THY DEATH THAN THOU HAST BEEN THIS HOUR BUT NOW I HAVE GIVEN THEE LIFE BECAUSE OF THE ASKING OF THIS LADY AND THEREWITH I GIVE THEE LEAVE TO COME THY WAYS WITH US
AND HE LAUGHED IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS WRATH BUT SHE WAS PALE AND HER LIPS QUIVERED AS SHE SAID SOFTLY AND SWEETLY WILT THOU VERILY SLAY THIS YOUNG MAN AND WHY NOT SAID HE
THIS IS THE BARGAIN TO BE STRUCK BETWEEN US EVEN NOW THOU WOULDST NOT REFRAIN FROM SLAYING THIS YOUNG MAN UNLESS PERCHANCE HE SHOULD SWEAR TO DEPART FROM US AND AS FOR ME I WOULD NOT GO BACK WITH THEE TO SUNHOME

SAINT ANTHONY BY NIGHT AND CLOUD SO THAT FEW MIGHT SEE HER OBEDIENT TO THE SCRIPTURE WHICH SAYETH LET NOT THY RIGHT HAND KNOW WHAT THY LEFT HAND DOETH AND SHE BAREFOOT IN HER SMOCK AMIDST THE RUGGED WOOD
BUT SHE LOOKED ON HIM KINDLY AND SAID TO HIM HOW FARES IT WITH THEE I AM SORRY OF THY HURT WHICH THOU HAST HAD FOR ME HE SAID FORSOOTH LADY A CHANCE KNOCK OR TWO IS NO GREAT MATTER FOR A LAD OF UPMEADS BUT OH
SO THAT HE STIRRED SOMEWHAT AND THE COLOUR CAME INTO HIS FACE A LITTLE THEN SHE BADE GATHER STORE OF BRACKEN FOR A BED FOR THE BLACK KNIGHT AND RALPH BESTIRRED HIMSELF THEREIN BUT THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN SAT LOOKING AT THE LADY AS SHE BUSIED HERSELF WITH HIS FRIEND
BESIDES HE DEEMED THAT THE LADY MIGHT COME THAT DAY WHEN HE WAS ALONE IN THE CASTLE AND THAT HIMSEEMED WOULD MAKE THE MEETING SWEETER YET SO HE YEA SAID THE CARLINE'S ASKING JOYOUSLY AND IN AN HOUR'S TIME SHE WENT HER WAYS AND LEFT HIM ALONE THERE
THINE OWN HEART BADE THEE TO STRIVE WITH HIM BECAUSE THOU DEEMEDST THAT HE LOVED ME BE CONTENT THOU HAST SLAIN HIM WHO STOOD IN THY WAY AS THOU DEEMEDST
FOR THEN I WILL RIDE MY WAYS TO THE DRY TREE AND THOU SHALT SLAY THE POOR YOUTH
FOR THOU ART MY PRISONER TO BE KEPT OR RANSOMED OR SET FREE AS I WILL BUT MY WILL IS THAT THOU SHALT NOT HAVE THINE ARMOUR AND WEAPONS AND THERE IS A CAUSE FOR THIS WHICH MAYHAPPEN I WILL TELL THEE HEREAFTER
AND MOREOVER HE IS MANY YARDS AWAY FROM ME AND SILVERFAX SO BEFORE THOU ART IN THE SADDLE WHERE SHALL I BE YEA FOR THE KNIGHT WAS HANDLING HIS ANLACE THOU MAYST CAST IT AND PERADVENTURE MAYST HIT SILVERFAX AND NOT ME
WHERE SHOULD I BE BUT HERE AH SHE SAID BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN NEVERTHELESS SHE WENT AND FETCHED HIS WAR GEAR AND LOOKED AT HIM FONDLY AS HE DID IT ON AND WENT HIS WAYS FROM THE HALL
I HAVE SEEN THEE BEFORE YEA SHE SAID TWICE BEFORE FAIR KNIGHT HOW IS THAT HE SAID ONCE I SAW THEE THE FAIREST THING IN THE WORLD AND EVIL MEN WOULD HAVE LED THEE TO SLAUGHTER BUT NOT TWICE
LEST SHE SHOULD INDEED COME TO THE CASTLE WHILE HE WAS AWAY AND NOT FINDING HIM DEPART AGAIN WHO KNOWS WHITHER AND WHEN THIS THOUGHT CAME UPON HIM HE CRIED ALOUD AND HASTENED AT HIS SWIFTEST BACK AGAIN TO THE CASTLE AND CAME THERE BREATHLESS AND WEARIED
FOR THE WORDS THAT HE HAD HEARD HE HEEDED NOT SAVE AS THEY MADE PICTURES FOR HIM OF THE WAYS OF THAT WOMAN OF THE FOREST SO THEY WENT ON SOBERLY TILL THE PRIEST LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ABOUT LIKE ONE COME OUT OF SLUMBER AND SAID IN A FIRM VOICE
AS OTHERS HAVE DONE BEFORE THEE WELL WELL
BUT WHEN RALPH HAD TIED UP THOSE OTHER TWO STEEDS BY SILVERFAX AND DRAWN REAR TO THOSE TWAIN THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN LOOKED UP AT HIM AND SPAKE IN A CHEERFUL VOICE THOU SEEMEST TO BE NO ILL MAN THOUGH THOU HAST COME ACROSS MY LADY
THE PRIEST MUTTERED SOMEWHAT AS HE PASSED WHICH RALPH CAUGHT NOT THE MEANING OF AND FELL MOODY AGAIN AND WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE PAST THE FORD HE DREW REIN AND SAID NOW SON I MUST TO MY CELL HARD BY THE CHURCH YONDER
FOR THESE WOODLAND WAYS ARE SOME WHAT BLIND SAID THE PRIEST
AND RAN TO THE OLD WOMAN AND CRIED OUT TO HER IS SHE COME IS SHE COME THE CARLINE LAUGHED AND SAID NAY SHE IS NOT BUT THOU ART COME PRAISE BE TO THE SAINTS BUT WHAT AILETH THEE NAY FEAR NOT SHE SHALL COME AT LAST
THOU FAIR MAN AND DOTH SO WITH HER RAIMENT THAT THOU MAYST BEST SEE HOW SHAPELY SHE IS OF LIMB AND FOOT AND TOYETH HER RIGHT HAND WITH HER LEFT WRIST AND THE LIKE WELL AS FOR ME I HAVE HAD MORE LOVERS THAN ONE OR TWO
WHAT WILT THOU DO WILT THOU ABIDE HERE BY WALTER THYSELF ALONE AND LET ME BRING THE IMP OF UPMEADS HOME TO OUR HOUSE OR WILT THOU RIDE HOME AND SEND FOLK WITH A LITTER TO US OR SHALL THIS YOUNGLING RIDE AT ALL ADVENTURE
RALPH SAID TO HIMSELF WHEN HE SAW HER DEPART THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE MORE JOY IN THE CASTLE OF HIS LADY IF HE WERE ALONE AND WOULD WEAR AWAY THE DAY IN BETTER PATIENCE THEREFOR BUT IN SOOTH THE HOURS OF THAT DAY WERE WORSE TO WEAR THAN ANY DAY THERE HAD YET BEEN
WELL DEEMEST THOU THAT I HAVE HAD MORE MEN THAN ONE TO LOVE ME I KNOW NOT MOTHER SAID RALPH WHO COULD SCARCE HOLD HIMSELF PATIENT THERE NOW QUOTH THE CARLINE LOOK AT MY DAMSEL SHE IS NOT MY DAUGHTER BUT MY BROTHER'S
AND WHAT SHE WOULD SAY TO HIM AND HOW HE SHOULD ANSWER HER TILL AT LAST THE NIGHT CAME AND HE WENT TO HIS BED AND SLEPT FOR THE VERY WEARINESS OF HIS LONGING WHEN THE NEW DAY CAME HE AROSE AND WENT INTO THE HALL AND FOUND THE CARLINE THERE WHO SAID TO HIM
THE BARGAIN IS STRUCK BETWIXT US AND THOU MAYEST LIGHT DOWN OFF SILVERFAX AS FOR ME I WILL GO FETCH WATER FROM THE LAKE THAT WE MAY WAKE UP THIS VALIANT AND MIGHTY YOUTH THIS NEWFOUND JEWEL AND BRING HIM TO HIS WITS AGAIN
SAID THE KNIGHT WHERE DOST THOU COME FROM WHERE IS THINE HOME SAID RALPH UPMEADS WELL THEN QUOTH THE BIG KNIGHT GO BACK TO UPMEADS AND LIVE
THEN SHALL SHE SHOW ME THE WAY TO THE WELL AT THE WORLD'S END AND I SHALL DRINK THEREOF AND NEVER GROW OLD EVEN AS SHE ENDURETH IN YOUTH AND SHE SHALL LOVE ME FOR EVER AND I HER FOR EVER SO HE THOUGHT
NAY SAID RALPH THOU HAST MY SWORD AND MAYST SLAY ME IF THOU WILT THEREFORE BE NOT WORD VALIANT WITH ME SAID THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN WELL WELL THOU HAST THE RIGHT OF IT THERE
AND GIRT HIS SWORD TO HIS SIDE AND WENT FORTH A FOOT AS BEFORE HE CROSSED THE RIVER BY A WIDE FORD AND STEPPING STONES SOMEWHAT BELOW THE POOL WHEREIN HE HAD BATHED ON THAT FIRST DAY AND ALREADY BY THEN HE HAD GOT SO FAR
FOR I PROMISE THEE NOT TO STIR OUT OF THE HOUSE WHILES THOU ART AWAY SAID RALPH NAY I WILL ABIDE HERE YEA SHE SAID I SEE THOU TRUSTEST ME NOT WELL NO MATTER
AND SO FAR AS OCCASION MAY SERVE HER SHE IS CONSTANT AT THE HOLY OFFICE NEITHER DOTH SHE SPARE TO CONFESS HER SINS AND TO DO ALL PENANCE WHICH IS BIDDEN HER YEA AND MORE FOR THOUGH I CANNOT SAY TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE WEARETH A HAIR
SO NOW I BID THEE REJOICE THAT THERE IS A GOOD KNIGHT MORE IN THE WORLD THAN WE DEEMED E E N NOW FOR THIS MY FRIEND WALTER THE BLACK IS ALIVE STILL YEA SAID THE LADY AND BELIKE HE SHALL LIVE A LONG WHILE YET
SO RALPH LOOKED AND SAW THAT THEY HAD STRIPPED THE KNIGHT OF HIS HAUBERK AND HELM AND BARED HIS BODY AND THAT THE LADY WAS DRESSING A GREAT AND SORE WOUND IN HIS SIDE NEITHER WAS HE COME TO HIMSELF AGAIN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN AND VERY GOODLY TO LOOK ON
WITHAL SHE IS AS STRONG AS A KNIGHT AND I WARRANT HER HARDIER OF HEART THAN MOST KNIGHTS A HAPPY MAN SHALT THOU BE FOR SURELY I DEEM THOU HAST NOT COME HITHER TO ABIDE HER WITHOUT SOME TOKEN OR WARRANT OF HER RALPH HELD DOWN HIS HEAD
THUS THEY ABODE FOR ABOUT THE SPACE OF ONE MINUTE AND MEANWHILE THE BIG MAN ROSE UP ON ONE KNEE AND STEADIED HIM WITH HIS SWORD FOR A MOMENT OF TIME AND THE BLADE WAS BLOODY FROM THE POINT HALF WAY UP TO THE HILT
SCOWLING AND HIS FACE WHITE AS CHALK THEN HE SPAKE TO HER COLDLY AND STERNLY STRETCHING OUT HIS BLOODY SWORD BEFORE HER I HAVE DONE THY BIDDING AND SLAIN MY VERY EARTHLY FRIEND OF FRIENDS FOR THY SAKE
AND WAS A WOMAN BELIKE THEN HE BETTERED HIS PACE AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO CAME SO NEAR THAT HE COULD SEE THE MEN CLEARLY THAT THEY WERE CLAD IN KNIGHTLY WAR GEAR AND WERE LAYING ON GREAT STROKES SO THAT THE STILL PLACE RANG WITH THE CLATTER AS FOR THE WOMAN
AND TO DAY IT WILL BE HANDY IF THOU ABIDEST FOR I HAVE AN ERRAND TO MY BROTHER IN THE FLESH WHO IS ONE OF THE BRETHREN OF THE THORN OVER YONDER IF THOU WILT GIVE ME LEAVE IT WILL BE TO MY PLEASURE AND GAIN RALPH WAS GLAD WHEN HE HEARD THIS DEEMING THAT IF SHE LEFT HIM ALONE THERE
THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN STOOD UP OVER HIM BESIDE THE LADY
AND SO ARRAYED FAIRER THAN ANY QUEEN IN A GOLDEN GOWN YEA AS FAIR AS THE WOODWIVES OF THE ANCIENT HEATHEN
KNOW THIS THAT WHATEVER ELSE SHE MAY BE SHE IS A RIGHT HOLY WOMAN OR HAST THOU PERCHANCE HEARD ANY EVIL TALES CONCERNING HER NOW RALPH WAS CONFUSED AT HIS WORD AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO SAY
AND FOUND THE SADDLE BAGS ON HIM AND TOOK FROM THEM BREAD AND FLESH AND A FLASK OF GOOD WINE AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE LADY WHO LAUGHED AND SAID THOU ART A GOOD SEEKER AND NO ILL FINDER THEN SHE GAVE THE WOUNDED MAN TO DRINK OF THE WINE
AND AS TO MY GOING WITH THEE AND THE LADY THOU HAST HEARD ME SAY UNDER THY DAGGER THAT I WOULD NOT FORBEAR TO FOLLOW HER SO I SCARCE NEED THY COMMAND THERETO THE KNIGHT SCOWLED ON HIM AND SAID HOLD THY PEACE FOOL THOU WERT BEST NOT STIR MY WRATH AGAIN
HE STILL HAD HIS BACK TO RALPH AND WAS STARING AT THE LADY SHE TURNED HER HEAD A LITTLE AND MADE A SIGN TO RALPH JUST AS THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN SAID THOU MISDOUBTEST THEE WHO SHALL HELP THEE IN THE DESERT LOOK OVER THY LEFT SHOULDER SHE SAID
O NO I GRIEVE AT IT FOR ALL THAT I HAD SUCH GOOD CAUSE TO HATE HIM HE SAID MY OWN HEART MY OWN HEART HALF OF MY HEART BIDDETH ME SLAY THEE WHO HAST MADE ME SLAY HIM WHAT WILT THOU GIVE ME
AND THY DOUBTING AND IF THOU WILT DO AFTER MY REDE THOU WILT CERTAINLY GO INTO THE WOOD TO MORROW AND SEE WHAT MAY BEFALL AND INDEED AND IN SOOTH THOU WILT LEAVE BEHIND THEE A TRUSTY FRIEND HE LOOKED ON HER KINDLY AND SMILED AND SAID
AND SHE STRETCHED OUT HER ARM OVER THE WOUNDED MAN WITH THE FINGERS POINTING DOWN THE WATER AND REDDENED WITHAL AS IF SHE FELT THE HEARTS GREEDINESS OF THE TWO MEN WHO WERE LOOKING ON HER BEAUTY THE BIG KNIGHT SIGHED AND SAID
SO SHE SPAKE AND RALPH YET LAY ON THE GRASS AND HEARD NOUGHT BUT THE KNIGHT'S FACE WAS DARK AND SWOLLEN WITH ANGER AS HE ANSWERED MY SWORN FRIEND YEA I UNDERSTAND THY GIBE
SO HE WORE THROUGH THE REMNANT OF THE DAY HOWSO HE MIGHT WITHOUT GOING OUT ADOORS AGAIN AND THE CARLINE CAME AND SPAKE WITH HIM BUT WHATEVER HE ASKED HER ABOUT THE LADY SHE WOULD NOT TELL AUGHT OF ANY IMPORT
THE REINS GATHERED IN HER HANDS SHE SMILED ON THE KNIGHT AS HE STOOD ASTONISHED AND CRIED TO HIM NOW LORD I WARN THEE DRAW NOT A SINGLE FOOT NIGHER TO ME FOR THOU SEEST THAT I HAVE SILVERFAX BETWEEN MY KNEES AND THOU KNOWEST HOW SWIFT HE IS AND IF I SEE THEE MOVE
BUT NOW I BID THEE DRINK OF THIS WATER AND THEN DO OFF THINE HELM AND HAUBERK AND GIVE ME THY SWORD AND DAGGER AND GO WITH US PEACEABLY
HE CAME OUT OF THE PINEWOOD ON TO THE GRASS BUT THERE WERE THORNBUSHES A FEW ABOUT SO THAT MOVING WARILY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER HE MIGHT PERCHANCE SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN WARILY HE WENT FORSOOTH GOING ALONG THE GREEN STRAND TO THE EAST AND THE HEAD OF THAT WATER
AND HE LIFTED HIS HAND AGAIN BUT AGAIN SHE STAYED HIM AND SAID LOOK THOU I WILL BUY HIM OF THEE AND INDEED I OWE HIM A LIFE HOW IS THAT SAID HE WHY WOULDST THOU KNOW SHE SAID
THE GODS OF THE GENTILES THEN THE PRIEST CROSSED HIMSELF AGAIN AND SPAKE AS SOLEMNLY AS A JUDGE ON THE BENCH SON I PRAY THAT IF THOU ART NOT IN THY RIGHT MIND THOU WILL COME THEREINTO ANON
HE SHALL SPRING AWAY WITH ME THOU WOTTEST HOW WELL I KNOW ALL THE WAYS OF THE WOODLAND AND I TELL THEE THAT THE WAYS BEHIND ME TO THE DRY TREE BE ALL SAFE AND OPEN AND THAT BEYOND THE GLIDING RIVER I SHALL COME ON ROGER OF THE ROPEWALK AND HIS MEN
BUT AT LAST HE HEARD THE TINKLE OF A LITTLE BELL COMING TOWARDS HIM SO HE STOOD STILL AND GOT THE HILT OF HIS SWORD READY TO HIS HAND AND THE TINKLE DREW NEARER AND HE HEARD WITHAL THE TRAMPLE OF SOME RIDING BEAST SO HE WENT TOWARD THE SOUND AND PRESENTLY IN A CLEARER PLACE OF THE WOOD
AND AS HUMBLE AND MEEK AS DOROTHY SHE BESTOWETH HER GOODS PLENTIFULLY TO THE CHURCH
IN SOOTH MOTHER I DEEM THOU ART BUT RIGHT THOUGH IT BE HARD FOR ME TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE TO WHICH IN A WAY MY LADY HATH BIDDEN ME YET I WILL DO THY BIDDING HEREIN
DREW HIMSELF UP STARK AND STIFF AND PRESSING ON THROUGH ALL RALPH'S STROKES THOUGH THEY RENT HIS MAIL HERE AND THERE RAN WITHIN HIS SWORD
AND ROSE UP HASTILY AND STOOD A LITTLE ALOOF AGAIN NOW RALPH SAT UP AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND WHEN HE SAW THE LADY HE FIRST BLUSHED RED AND THEN TURNED VERY PALE FOR THE FULL LIFE WAS IN HIM AGAIN AND HE KNEW HER AND LOVE DREW STRONGLY AT HIS HEART STRINGS
I SEEK ADVENTURES BUT UNLESS I SEE MORE THAN I HAVE THIS FORENOON OR THOU CANST TELL ME OF THEM BACK WILL I WHENCE I CAME
HE COULD SEE BUT LITTLE OF HER BECAUSE OF THE FIGHTING MEN BEFORE HER AND THE SHADOW OF THE OAK BOUGHS FELL ON HER WITHAL NOW AS HE WENT HIDDEN BY THE BUSHES THEY HID THE MEN ALSO FROM HIM AND WHEN HE WAS COME TO THE LAST BUSH SOME FIFTY PACES FROM THEM
AND EVEN BEFORE I WAS OLD I WAS NOT YOUNG I AM NOW FOUL OF FAVOUR AND EVEN BEFORE I BECAME FOUL I WAS NOT SO FAIR WELL THEN YEA WHAT THEN SAID RALPH THIS THEN FAIR YOUNG FOOL SAID SHE
HE WAS NO MORE GRIM AND MOODY BUT SMILING AND JOYOUS AND HE SPAKE AND SAID YOUNG MAN THIS SHALL STAND THEE IN GOOD STEAD THAT I HAVE NOT SLAIN MY FRIEND THIS BOUT SOOTH TO SAY IT MIGHT ELSE HAVE GONE HARD WITH THEE ON THE WAY TO MY HOUSE
BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE OAK TREE AGAIN LO THE KNIGHT AND THE LADY BOTH KNEELING OVER THE BODY OF THE BLACK KNIGHT AND RALPH SAW THAT THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN WAS SOBBING AND WEEPING SORELY SO THAT HE DEEMED THAT HE WAS TAKING LEAVE OF HIS FRIEND THAT LAY DEAD THERE
AND THEREWITHAL SHE TURNED HER FACE TOWARD RALPH AS SHE MIGHT DO ON ANY CHANCE MET COURTEOUS MAN AND HE SAW HER SMILING BUT SHE SAID NOUGHT TO HIM AND GAVE NO TOKEN OF KNOWING HIM THEN THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN SPRANG TO HIS FEET
AND MY LIFE FAIR WILL THE GAME BE TO FIGHT WITH THY DEVIL AS I HAVE FOUGHT WITH MY FRIEND
YET HOW IF HE HAVE NO WILL TO FARE WITH US SHE LAUGHED AND SAID THEN SHALT THOU HAVE HIM WITH THEE AS THY CAPTIVE AND THRALL HAST THOU NOT CONQUERED HIM IN BATTLE HE STOOD SILENT A MOMENT AND THEN HE SAID THOU SAYEST IT
TO MORROW IS A NEW DAY AND FAIR IS THE WOODLAND HALL OF SUMMER TIDE NEITHER SHALL WATER FAIL US BUT AS TO VICTUAL I WOT NOT SAVE THAT WE HAVE NONE THE LADY LAUGHED AND SAID TO RALPH
BUT FROM WHOSE MOUTH FORSOOTH I WILL TELL THEE FROM A SORT OF IDLE JADES YOUNG WOMEN WHO WOULD BE THOUGHT FAIRER THAN THEY BE WHO ARE AFRAID OF EVERYTHING SAVE A NAKED MAN AND WHO CAN LIE EASIER THAN THEY CAN SAY THEIR PATERNOSTER
WHERE ERST THOU SHAMEDST ME NOW WILL I BUY THY NAY SAY WITH MINE AND IF THOU GIVE THE YOUNGLING HIS LIFE AND SUFFER HIM TO COME HIS WAYS WITH US
IT IS HER WAY HERE IN THE SUMMER TIDE TO BATHE HER IN YONDER POOL UP THE WATER AND IT WAS THE SAME POOL WHEREIN RALPH HAD BATHED AND SHE HATH ME AND MY NIECE AND TWO OTHER WOMEN TO HOLD UP THE SILKEN CLOTH BETWIXT HER BODY AND THE WORLD SO THAT I HAVE SEEN HER AS GOD MADE HER
RALPH SAID NOUGHT BUT WAXED SHAMEFACED AS HE DEEMED THAT THE PRIEST EYED HIM CURIOUSLY AT LAST HE SAID I WILL ASK THEE A QUESTION IN TURN FATHER YEA SAID THE PRIEST SAID RALPH
THERE WAS SCARCE A SMILE ON HER FACE AS SHE SAID GENTLY ONE THING IS TO BE THOUGHT OF THAT WALTER'S SOUL IS NOT YET SO FAST IN HIS BODY THAT EITHER THOU OR SOME ROUGH HANDED LEECH MAY BE SURE OF HEALING HIM IT MUST BE THIS HAND
YEA HE SAID GRIMLY WHEN THOU ART WEARY OF HIM O ART THOU NOT SHAMELESS AMONGST WOMEN YET MUST I NEEDS PAY THY PRICE THOUGH MY HONOUR AND THE WELFARE OF MY LIFE GO WITH IT
WHEREWITH WILT THOU REWARD ME THEN ONCE MORE RALPH HEARD THE VOICE WHICH HE REMEMBERED SO SWEET AMIDST PERIL AND BATTLE AFORETIME AS SHE SAID AS COLDLY AS THE KNIGHT I BADE THEE NOT
SHE KNIT HER BROW AND SPAKE ANGRILY LEAVE TO DEPART SHE SAID THEN AFTER A WHILE AND IN A KINDER VOICE AND THUS MUCH OF MY LOVE THAT I PRAY THEE NOT TO SORROW FOR ME BUT TO HAVE A GOOD HEART
AND LOOKING DOWN ON HIM NOT UNKINDLY THEN HE TURNED ABOUT TO THE LADY BUT LO SHE HAD LEFT HIS SIDE SHE HAD GLIDED AWAY AND GOT TO HER HORSE WHICH WAS TETHERED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OAK TREE AND HAD LOOSED HIM AND MOUNTED HIM
WHO WOULD ELSE HAVE BEEN TORMENTED TO DEATH BY THE BURGERS WELL SAID THE KNIGHT PERCHANCE THOU HAST MORE MERCY THAN I LOOKED FOR OF THEE THOUGH I MISDOUBT THEE THAT THOU MAYST YET PRAY ME OR SOME OTHER TO SLAY HIM FOR THEE
AND WAS THE READIER THEREIN BECAUSE THE LADY LOOKED ON HIM KINDLY AND COMPASSIONATELY AS HE WENT BY HER HE FOUND THE HORSES SPEEDILY A BLACK HORSE THAT WAS OF THE BLACK KNIGHT AND A BAY OF THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN AND HE CAME BACK WITH THEM LIGHTLY
BUT AMIDST ALL HIS THINKING HIS HEART CAME BACK TO THIS WHEN I MEET HER SHE WILL TELL ME OF IT ALL I NEED BE NO WISER THAN TO LEARN HOW TO MEET HER AND TO MAKE HER LOVE ME
RALPH CAME FORTH FROM THE BUSHES WITH HIS DRAWN SWORD IN HIS HAND AND EVEN THEREWITH WHAT WITH THE TWO KNIGHTS BEING BOTH LOW UPON THE EARTH WHAT WITH THE WOMAN HERSELF COMING FROM OUT THE SHADOW OF THE OAK BOUGHS AND TURNING HER TOWARD RALPH HE SAW HER CLEARLY
BUT NOW MUST WE SET FORTH ON OUR ROAD AND HERE IS WORK FOR THEE TO DO
AND KEEN SIGHTED AS HE WAS COULD MAKE OUT THAT THREE MEN WERE ON THE HITHER SIDE OF THE OAK TREES AND ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THEM WAS A WHITE HORSE THITHERWARD THEN HE MADE STEALING FROM BUSH TO BUSH SINCE HE DEEMED THAT HE NEEDED NOT BE SEEN OF MEN WHO MIGHT BE FOES
BUT YET I WILL SAY ONE WORD TO THEE ERE WE SUNDER TO WIT THAT TO MY MIND THE HOLY LADY WILL LOVE NO ONE BUT THE SAINTS OF HEAVEN SAVE IT BE SOME MAN WITH WHOM ALL WOMEN ARE IN LOVE THEREWITH HE TURNED AWAY SUDDENLY
AND ENDURED WITH PATIENCE HER THRALLDOM WITH STRIPES AND TORMENTS OF HER BODY LIKE THE WORST OF THE THRALLS OF THE ANCIENT HEATHEN MEN LASTLY HE MIGHT NOT LEARN FROM THE BOOK WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS THAT LONE PLACE OR AUGHT OF THE ROAD TO THE WELL AT THE WORLD'S END
AND LET THIS YOUNG MAN DEPART UNHURT WHETHER THOU MADEST HIM OR HAST BUT LED HIM AWAY FROM COUNTRY AND FRIENDS AND ALL THEN DO THOU COME WITH ME AND MAKE SOME SEMBLANCE OF LOVING ME AND SUFFER ME TO LOVE THEE
SO WHEN DINNER OVER THEY TURNED TO THEIR WORK AGAIN HE WENT BACK TO THE CASTLE AND READ IN THAT BOOK AND LOOKED AT THE PICTURES THEREOF AND KEPT TURNING HIS WONDER AND HOPE AND FEAR OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN HIS MIND AND MAKING TO HIMSELF STORIES OF HOW HE SHOULD MEET THE LADY
TILL THE PRIEST PLUCKED UP HEART AGAIN AND SAID TURNING TO RALPH BUT NOT MEETING HIS EYE MY SON I WEEP BECAUSE MEN AND WOMEN ARE SO EVIL AND MIS SAY EACH OTHER SO SORELY EVEN AS THEY DO BY THIS HOLY WOMAN AS HE SPAKE HIS TEARS BRAKE OUT AGAIN
BEFORE HE SAW THE WESTERING SUN SHINE BRIGHTLY FROM A NAKED SWORD AND THEN ANOTHER SPRANG UP TO MEET IT AND HE HEARD FAINTLY THE CLASH OF STEEL
YET NOT TO THEE WILL I GIVE HIM IF I MAY HELP IT LO YOU SWEET HE IS JUST OPENING HIS EYES THEREWITH HE ROSE UP FROM RALPH WHO RAISED HIMSELF A LITTLE AND SAT UP DAZED AND FEEBLE
THEREAT RALPH'S HEART FELL AGAIN AND HE SAID SAYEST THOU MOTHER THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS ABIDING LIKE ME IN THE TOWER I KNOW NOT WHAT THY WORDS MEAN THE CARLINE LAUGHED
RALPH SPAKE AFTER A WHILE AND SAID TELL ME IS SHE GOOD AND A GOOD WOMAN
THOU ART MERCIFUL MY QUEEN THOUGH NOT TO ME AND A CHURL WERE I IF I WERE LESS MERCIFUL THAN THOU THEREFORE
AND ASKED HIM WHITHER HE WOULD SAID THE PRIEST I AM FOR THE LITTLE PLAIN AND THE LAND OF ABUNDANCE WHENCE ART THOU MY SON AND WHITHER WILT THOU FROM THAT VERY LAND I COME SAID RALPH AND AS TO WHITHER
AND SAW HOW THE BANK SLOPED UP GENTLY FROM ITS ENDING TOWARD THE PINE WOOD IN FRONT OF WHOSE CLOSE SET TREES STOOD THREE GREAT BOLED TALL OAK TREES ON A SMOOTH PIECE OF GREEN SWARD AND NOW HE SAW THAT THERE WERE FOLK COME BEFORE HIM ON THIS GREEN PLACE
HE WENT NOT WITHOUT THE HOUSE AT ALL THAT DAY FOR HE DEEMED THAT THE FOLK ABROAD WOULD NOTE OF HIM THAT HE WAS SO CHANGED AND RESTLESS WHILES HE READ IN THAT BOOK OR TURNED THE LEAVES OVER NOT READING IT WHILES HE WENT INTO THE CHAMBER OF ESTATE
SWORD IN HAND SMILING BUT SOMEWHAT PALE HE DREW ABACK FROM THE LADY AND SPINNING ROUND ON HIS HEEL FACED RALPH AND CRIED OUT HAH HAST THOU RAISED UP A DEVIL AGAINST ME THOU SORCERESS
THEN GREW RALPH SHAMEFACED AND TURNED AWAY FROM HER AND MISCALLED HIMSELF FOR A FOOL AND A DASTARD
AND RODE SMARTLY TOWARDS HIS CHURCH AND RALPH DEEMED THAT HE WAS WEEPING ONCE MORE AS FOR RALPH HE WENT QUIETLY HOME TOWARD THE CASTLE FOR THE SUN WAS SETTING NOW
RUSHED ON HIS FOE AND SMOTE SO FIERCELY THAT HE FELL TO THE EARTH BEFORE HIM AND THE BIG MAN FELL UPON HIM AS HE FELL AND LET KNEE AND SWORD POMMEL AND FIST FOLLOW THE STROKE AND THERE THEY WALLOWED ON THE EARTH TOGETHER STRAIGHTWAY
THAT WHEN HE WAS ABOUT THAT WORK HE WAS MINDED TO BE A CRAFTSMASTER FOR THERE IS NO BLEMISH ABOUT HER THAT SHE SHOULD HIDE HER AT ALL OR ANYWHERE
AND STILL THE CARLINE CAME NOT TO HIM AND HE THOUGHT SHE LEAVETH ME ALONE THAT I MAY DO HER BIDDING
NOW DEVIL LET SEE WHETHER THOU WILT BLEED BLACK THEREWITH HE RAISED UP HIS HAND BUT THE WEAPON WAS STAYED OR EVER IT FELL FOR THE LADY HAD GLIDED UP TO THEM WHEN SHE SAW THAT RALPH WAS OVERCOME
SO THAT THE BLOOD SPRANG AND FELL ON FIERCELY ENOUGH SMITING TO RIGHT AND LEFT
RALPH SHOOK HIS HEAD AND KNIT HIS BROWS AND SAID I WILL NOT YEA SAID THE KNIGHT THOU WILT NOT LIVE THEN MUST I SHAPE ME TO THY HUMOUR STAND ON THY FEET AND FIGHT IT OUT
AND GLOOM SEEMED GATHERING ON HIM AGAIN BUT WHEN THE BRACKEN WAS ENOUGH THE LADY MADE A BED DEFTLY AND SPEEDILY AND BETWEEN THE THREE THEY LAID THE WOUNDED MAN THEREON WHO SEEMED COMING TO HIMSELF SOMEWHAT AND SPAKE A FEW WORDS
BUT NOT MUCH FOR HE DEEMED THAT HER GOODWILL TO HIM WAS ABUNDANT WHICH INDEED IT WAS NOW SHE LOOKS ON HIM AND SAYS TRULY IT DOES MY HEART GOOD TO SEE THEE BUT THOU POOR BOY THOU ART WEARING THYSELF WITH THY LONGING
SAID HE NOT UNCOMPELLED SHE SAID IF THOU BIDDEST ME GO WITH THREATS OF HEWING AND MANGLING THE BODY WHICH THOU SAYEST THOU LOVEST NEEDS MUST I GO THEN YET SCARCE WILT THOU DO THIS
WHEN THOU WENTEST FORTH BEFORE I WAS TROUBLED AT THY GOING AND FEARED FOR THY RETURNING BUT NOW I FEAR NOT
WOULDST KEEP ME AWAY FROM ALL MEN YEA I KNOW WHAT THOU WOULDST SAY THOU WOULDST KEEP ME FROM SINNING AGAIN AND SHE SMILED BUT BITTERLY WELL THE TALE IS NO LONG ONE FIVE DAYS AGO
AND HE WENT AND LAY DOWN IN HIS BED AND SLEPT AND DREAMED OF THE DAYS OF UPMEAD AND THINGS FORGOTTEN IN HIS WAKING TIME CAME BETWEEN HIM AND ANY MEMORIES OF HIS PRESENT LONGING AND THE DAYS THEREOF HE AWOKE AND AROSE BETIMES IN THE MORNING
WITH MY CAPTAIN OF WAR AT THE PERIL OF OUR LIVES TO DELIVER FOUR FAITHFUL FRIENDS OF MINE WHO WERE ELSE DOOMED TO AN EVIL DEATH HE SAID NOUGHT BUT GAZED AT HER FACE WONDERING AT HER VALIANCY AND GOODNESS
O FOR A DRAUGHT OF THE WELL AT THE WORLD'S END THAT THE LOVE MIGHT LAST LONG AND LONG SO HE WENT ON A WHILE BETWIXT THE TREES AND THE THICKETS TILL IT WAS A LITTLE PAST NOON BUT ALL ON A SUDDEN A PANIC FEAR TOOK HIM
YET DID HE SEEM TO SEE HER BODY THROUGH THAT WHICH COVERED IT BUT NOW HER ATTIRE WAS BUT SIMPLE A GREEN GOWN THIN AND SHORT AND THEREOVER A COTE HARDY OF BLACK CLOTH WITH ORPHREYS OF GOLD AND COLOURS BUT ON HER NECK WAS A COLLAR THAT SEEMED TO HIM
I TELL THEE MY SON THAT THOU MAYEST SET THY LOVE UPON HER WITHOUT SIN AND THEREWITH SUDDENLY HE FELL A WEEPING AND RALPH WAS ILL AT EASE OF HIS WEEPING
WELL SINCE THOU WILT NOT HAVE THIS YOUNGLING SLAIN I MAY DEEM AT LEAST THAT HE IS NO DEVIL OF THY MAKING ELSE WOULDST THOU BE GLAD OF HIS SLAYING SO THAT HE MIGHT BE OUT OF THE PATH OF THEE SO A MAN HE IS
TILL HE HAD GOTTEN THE WHOLE TALE INTO HIS HEAD
YOUNG MAN CANST THOU HEAR MY WORDS RALPH SMILED FEEBLY AND NODDED A YEA SAY DOST THOU LOVE THY LIFE THEN SAID THE KNIGHT RALPH FOUND SPEECH AND SAID FAINTLY YEA
THAT IT TOLD NOT WHENCE THAT LADY CAME NOR WHAT SHE WAS NOR AUGHT ELSE SAVE THAT THERE SHE WAS IN THE WOOD BY HERSELF AND WAS FOUND THEREIN BY THE KING'S SON
HE SHALL COME WITH ME WILL HE NILL HE UNARMED AND AS A PRISONER AND THE SPOIL OF MY VALIANCY AND HE LAUGHED NOT ALTOGETHER IN BITTERNESS BUT AS IF SOME JOY WERE RISING IN HIS HEART NOW MY QUEEN SAID HE
BUT THOSE NOTHING TO THE POINT THEN THE LADY TOOK HER GAY EMBROIDERED CLOAK WHICH LAY AT THE FOOT OF THE OAK TREE AND CAST IT OVER HIM AND AS RALPH DEEMED
THOUGH IT MAY BE LEADING A FAIR WOMAN BY THE HAND SO GO AND ALL LUCK GO WITH THEE RALPH SMILED AT HER WORDS AND WENT HIS WAYS AND CAME INTO THE WOOD THAT LAY DUE SOUTH FROM THE CASTLE AND HE WENT ON AND ON AND HAD NO THOUGHT OF TURNING BACK
AND SEEK TO SUNWAY THROUGH THE BLIND WOODLAND WHICH SHALL IT BE THE KNIGHT LAUGHED OUTRIGHT AND SAID YEA FAIR ONE THIS IS MUCH LIKE TO THE TALE OF THE CARLE AT THE FERRY WITH THE FOX AND THE GOAT AND THE CABBAGE
OLD AND YOUNG WEIGH IN THY MIND BESIDE THE WORD I TELL THEE OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND KNOW CONCERNING THIS MOST EXCELLENT OF LADIES I TROW NOT AND FOR MY PART I TELL THEE THAT THOUGH SHE IS VERILY AS FAIR AS VENUS GOD SAVE US
RALPH STAGGERED UP TO HIS FEET BUT WAS SO FEEBLE STILL THAT HE SANK DOWN AGAIN AND MUTTERED I MAY NOT I AM SICK AND FAINT AND THEREWITH SWOONED AWAY AGAIN BUT THE KNIGHT STOOD A WHILE LEANING ON HIS SWORD
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE THE LEECHCRAFT OF THE LADY MEANWHILE SHE WENT TO RALPH AND STOOD BY HIM WHO NOW BEGAN TO STIR AGAIN AND SHE KNELT DOWN BY HIM AND KISSED HIS FACE GENTLY
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO AN ADVENTURE IN THE WOOD RALPH ARRAYED HIMSELF FOR DEPARTURE NEXT MORNING WITHOUT MORE WORDS AND WHEN HE WAS READY THE CARLINE SAID TO HIM
ART THOU ONE OF MY LADY'S LORDS RALPH REDDENED AS HE SIGHED AND SAID I AM NO CAPTAIN OF HERS THEN SMILED THE PRIEST AND SAID
THEN SHE SAID AS SHE DREW HER HAND AWAY AND SPAKE IN SUCH A VOICE AND SO LOOKING AT HIM THAT EVERY WORD WAS AS A CARESS TO HIM THY SOUL IS COMING BACK TO THEE MY FRIEND AND THOU ART WELL AT EASE IS IT NOT SO O YEA
HE RESTED TWICE AND STILL WENT ON TILL THE FASHION OF THE THICKETS AND THE WOODS CHANGED ABOUT HIM AND AT LAST WHEN THE SUN WAS GETTING LOW HE SAW LIGHT GLEAMING THROUGH A GREAT WOOD OF PINES WHICH HAD LONG BEEN DARK BEFORE HIM AGAINST THE TALL BOLES
AND WHICH LONG ENDURED AGAIN HE COULD NOT GATHER FROM THAT BOOK WHY SHE HAD GONE BACK TO THE LONE PLACE IN THE WOODS WHEREAS SHE MIGHT HAVE WEDDED ONE OF THOSE WARRING BARONS WHO SORELY DESIRED HER NOR WHY SHE HAD YIELDED HERSELF TO THE WITCH OF THAT PLACE
SHE SPAKE NOT BUT STOOD QUIETLY LOOKING ON HIM NOT UNKINDLY WHILE A WIND CAME UP FROM THE WATER AND PLAYED WITH A FEW LIGHT LOCKS OF HAIR THAT HUNG DOWN FROM THAT RUDDY CROWN AND BLEW HER RAIMENT FROM HER FEET AND WRAPPED IT CLOSE ROUND HER LIMBS
AND HE COULD NOT MEET THE OLD WOMAN'S EYES AS SHE SPAKE THUS AND THE MAIDEN TOOK HERSELF OUT OF EARSHOT AT THE FIRST WORDS OF THE CARLINE HEREOF
BUT HAVE YOU EVER FOUND ANY WHO HAVE BEEN DISSATISFIED WITH DYING IT MUST THEREFORE
PROVIDED A MAN DOES NOT TERRIFY HIMSELF WITH THE EXPECTATION FOR MY PART I AM OF THIS MIND AND IF A MAN COULD BY ANY MEANS AVOID IT THOUGH BY CREEPING UNDER A CALF'S SKIN I AM ONE
AND CONSEQUENTLY IF IT FRIGHTS US TIS A PERPETUAL TORMENT FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SORT OF CONSOLATION THERE IS NO WAY BY WHICH IT MAY NOT REACH US WE MAY CONTINUALLY TURN OUR HEADS THIS WAY AND THAT
PLAYING A MATCH AT TENNIS RECEIVED A BLOW OF A BALL A LITTLE ABOVE HIS RIGHT EAR WHICH AS IT GAVE NO MANNER OF SIGN OF WOUND OR CONTUSION HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF IT NOR SO MUCH AS SAT DOWN TO REPOSE HIMSELF BUT NEVERTHELESS
OF ALL THE BENEFITS THAT VIRTUE CONFERS UPON US THE CONTEMPT OF DEATH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AS THE MEANS THAT ACCOMMODATES HUMAN LIFE WITH A SOFT AND EASY TRANQUILLITY AND GIVES US A PURE AND PLEASANT TASTE OF LIVING
OMNIUM VERSATUR URNA
BUT TIS FOLLY TO THINK OF DOING ANYTHING THAT WAY THEY GO THEY COME THEY GALLOP AND DANCE AND NOT A WORD OF DEATH ALL THIS IS VERY FINE BUT WITHAL WHEN IT COMES EITHER TO THEMSELVES THEIR WIVES THEIR CHILDREN OR FRIENDS
BE AS CAUTIOUS AS HE MAY
AND TORMENTS HIMSELF BY THINKING OF THE BLOW TO COME CLAUDIANUS IN RUF II ONE
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE A MAN SHOULD DISENGAGE HIMSELF FROM THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OR AVOID FANCYING THAT IT HAS US EVERY MOMENT BY THE THROAT WHAT MATTER IS IT YOU WILL SAY WHICH WAY IT COMES TO PASS
THE FIRST HOUR THAT GAVE US LIFE TOOK AWAY ALSO AN HOUR
SHE IS THEN BECOME SOVEREIGN OF ALL HER LUSTS AND PASSIONS
GRATA SUPERVENIET QUAE
UNA THEY DO NOT ADD THAT DYING WE HAVE NO LONGER A DESIRE TO POSSESS THINGS
AND COME THE WORST THAT CAN COME THE DISTRIBUTION AND VARIETY OF ALL THE ACTS OF MY COMEDY ARE PERFORMED IN A YEAR IF YOU HAVE OBSERVED THE REVOLUTION OF MY FOUR SEASONS THEY COMPREHEND THE INFANCY THE YOUTH
WE ARE ALL BOUND ONE VOYAGE THE LOT OF ALL SOONER OR LATER IS TO COME OUT OF THE URN ALL MUST TO ETERNAL EXILE SAIL AWAY
SO IF SHE ONCE CAN ASSURE HERSELF SHE MAY BOAST WHICH IS A THING AS IT WERE SURPASSING HUMAN CONDITION THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT DISQUIET
AND IT IS NOW BUT JUST FIFTEEN DAYS SINCE I WAS COMPLETE NINE AND THIRTY YEARS OLD I MAKE ACCOUNT TO LIVE AT LEAST AS MANY MORE IN THE MEANTIME TO TROUBLE A MAN'S SELF WITH THE THOUGHT OF A THING SO FAR OFF WERE FOLLY
BECOME SO FAMILIAR AS TO BE NO TROUBLE AT ALL OTHERWISE I FOR MY PART SHOULD BE IN A PERPETUAL FRIGHT AND FRENZY FOR NEVER MAN WAS SO DISTRUSTFUL OF HIS LIFE NEVER MAN SO UNCERTAIN AS TO ITS DURATION
CHIRON REFUSED TO BE IMMORTAL WHEN HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH HE WAS TO ENJOY IT BY THE GOD OF TIME ITSELF AND ITS DURATION HIS FATHER SATURN
PREVIOUSLY THE YEAR COMMENCED AT EASTER
A MAN MUST DESIGN NOTHING THAT WILL REQUIRE SO MUCH TIME TO THE FINISHING OR AT LEAST WITH NO SUCH PASSIONATE DESIRE TO SEE IT BROUGHT TO PERFECTION WE ARE BORN TO ACTION
OF UNDERSTANDING HE IS TO DO IT THE ROMANS BY REASON THAT THIS POOR SYLLABLE DEATH SOUNDED SO HARSHLY TO THEIR EARS AND SEEMED SO OMINOUS
TO ACCUSTOM SAYS LYCURGUS THE COMMON PEOPLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE STARTLED AT THE SIGHT OF A CORPSE AND TO THE END THAT THE CONTINUAL SPECTACLE OF BONES GRAVES AND FUNERAL OBSEQUIES SHOULD PUT US IN MIND OF OUR FRAIL CONDITION
SO DID WE WEEP AND SO MUCH IT COST US TO ENTER INTO THIS AND SO DID WE PUT OFF OUR FORMER VEIL IN ENTERING INTO IT NOTHING CAN BE A GRIEVANCE THAT IS BUT ONCE
IF YOU HAVE NOT KNOWN HOW TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF IT
MAKE USE OF TIME WHILE IT IS PRESENT WITH YOU IT DEPENDS UPON YOUR WILL AND NOT UPON THE NUMBER OF DAYS TO HAVE A SUFFICIENT LENGTH OF LIFE IS IT POSSIBLE YOU CAN IMAGINE NEVER TO ARRIVE AT THE PLACE TOWARDS WHICH YOU ARE CONTINUALLY GOING
I FIND IT LESS EXEMPT FROM TRAVERSES AND INCONVENIENCES THAN VIRTUE ITSELF AND BESIDES THAT THE ENJOYMENT IS MORE MOMENTARY FLUID AND FRAIL IT HAS ITS WATCHINGS FASTS AND LABOURS ITS SWEAT AND ITS BLOOD
AND HAVE NOTHING SO FREQUENT IN OUR THOUGHTS AS DEATH UPON ALL OCCASIONS REPRESENT HIM TO OUR IMAGINATION IN HIS EVERY SHAPE AT THE STUMBLING OF A HORSE AT THE FALLING OF A TILE AT THE LEAST PRICK WITH A PIN
WHO IN HIS FOLLY SEEKS TO ADVANCE BACKWARDS
WHICH MADE HIM VERY WISELY ANSWER HIM
I BELIEVE IN TRUTH THAT IT IS THOSE TERRIBLE CEREMONIES AND PREPARATIONS WHEREWITH WE SET IT OUT THAT MORE TERRIFY US THAN THE THING ITSELF A NEW QUITE CONTRARY WAY OF LIVING THE CRIES OF MOTHERS WIVES AND CHILDREN
NO MAN IS MORE FRAGILE THAN ANOTHER NO MAN MORE CERTAIN THAN ANOTHER OF TO MORROW SENECA
LET IT BE DOING THAT I HAD DESIGNED
KNOW YOU NOT THAT WHEN DEAD THERE CAN BE NO OTHER LIVING SELF TO LAMENT YOU DEAD STANDING ON YOUR GRAVE
THEY WHICH DIE AT EIGHT OF THE CLOCK IN THE MORNING DIE IN THEIR YOUTH
BUT WHAT YOUNG AND OLD DIE UPON THE SAME TERMS NO ONE DEPARTS OUT OF LIFE OTHERWISE THAN IF HE HAD BUT JUST BEFORE ENTERED INTO IT NEITHER IS ANY MAN SO OLD AND DECREPIT WHO
I HAVE OFTEN CONSIDERED WITH MYSELF WHENCE IT SHOULD PROCEED THAT IN WAR THE IMAGE OF DEATH WHETHER WE LOOK UPON IT IN OURSELVES OR IN OTHERS SHOULD WITHOUT COMPARISON
BESIDES THE ACCIDENT THAT IMMEDIATELY THREATENS US WE SHALL FIND THAT THE SOUND AND THE SICK THOSE THAT ARE ABROAD AT SEA AND THOSE THAT SIT BY THE FIRE THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN BATTLE AND THOSE WHO SIT IDLE AT HOME ARE THE ONE AS NEAR IT AS THE OTHER
THIS VERY BEING OF YOURS THAT YOU NOW ENJOY IS EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWIXT LIFE AND DEATH THE DAY OF YOUR BIRTH IS ONE DAY'S ADVANCE TOWARDS THE GRAVE PRIMA
NO DAY HAS FOLLOWED NIGHT IN WHICH THERE HAS NOT BEEN HEARD SOBS AND SORROWING CRIES THE COMPANIONS OF DEATH AND FUNERALS
RATHER CONSULT EFFECTS AND EXPERIENCE ACCORDING TO THE COMMON COURSE OF THINGS TIS LONG SINCE THAT THOU HAST LIVED BY EXTRAORDINARY FAVOUR THOU HAST ALREADY OUTLIVED THE ORDINARY TERM OF LIFE AND THAT IT IS SO
WHEREUPON I TOLD HIM AS IT WAS REALLY TRUE THAT THOUGH I WAS NO MORE THAN A LEAGUE'S DISTANCE ONLY FROM MY OWN HOUSE AND MERRY AND WELL
THAT BY IMAGINATION I MAGNIFY THOSE INCONVENIENCES BY ONE HALF AND APPREHEND THEM TO BE MUCH MORE TROUBLESOME THAN I FIND THEM REALLY TO BE WHEN THEY LIE THE MOST HEAVY UPON ME I HOPE TO FIND DEATH THE SAME
THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND PASSING OVER THEIR WHOLE LIVES WITHOUT EVER KNOWING WHAT POVERTY IS AND SOME WITHOUT SORROW OR SICKNESS AS XENOPHILUS THE MUSICIAN WHO LIVED A HUNDRED AND SIX YEARS IN A PERFECT AND CONTINUAL HEALTH
I WAS BORN BETWIXT ELEVEN AND TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE FORENOON THE LAST DAY OF FEBRUARY FIFTEEN THIRTY THREE ACCORDING TO OUR COMPUTATION
BECAUSE YOU STILL ARE AFTER DEATH WHEN YOU ARE NO MORE ALIVE OR IF YOU HAD RATHER HAVE IT SO YOU ARE DEAD AFTER LIFE BUT DYING ALL THE WHILE YOU LIVE AND DEATH HANDLES THE DYING MUCH MORE RUDELY THAN THE DEAD
SURPRISING THEM AT UNAWARES AND UNPREPARED THEN WHAT TORMENT WHAT OUTCRIES WHAT MADNESS AND DESPAIR DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING SO SUBDUED SO CHANGED AND SO CONFOUNDED A MAN MUST THEREFORE MAKE MORE EARLY PROVISION FOR IT
IT IS MORE DUE TO THE ASSISTANCE OF VIRTUE THAN TO ANY OTHER ASSISTANCE WHATEVER
AND TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ALL MANNER OF INTEREST IN IT THAN I EXPECT TO DO THE DEADEST DEATHS ARE THE BEST
WE ARE TO DISCHARGE OURSELVES FROM THESE VULGAR AND HURTFUL HUMOURS TO THIS PURPOSE IT WAS THAT MEN FIRST APPOINTED THE PLACES OF SEPULTURE ADJOINING THE CHURCHES AND IN THE MOST FREQUENTED PLACES OF THE CITY
AS THAT WHICH IS MORE FAVOURABLE GENTLE AND NATURAL AND NOT THAT FROM WHICH WE HAVE DENOMINATED IT THE OTHER AND MEANER PLEASURE IF IT COULD DESERVE THIS FAIR NAME IT OUGHT TO BE BY WAY OF COMPETITION AND NOT OF PRIVILEGE
SEEING THAT OF ALL THE PLEASURES WE KNOW THE VERY PURSUIT IS PLEASANT THE ATTEMPT EVER RELISHES OF THE QUALITY OF THE THING TO WHICH IT IS DIRECTED FOR IT IS A GOOD PART OF AND CONSUBSTANTIAL WITH THE EFFECT
GIVE PLACE TO OTHERS AS OTHERS HAVE GIVEN PLACE TO YOU EQUALITY IS THE SOUL OF EQUITY WHO CAN COMPLAIN OF BEING COMPREHENDED IN THE SAME DESTINY WHEREIN ALL ARE INVOLVED BESIDES LIVE AS LONG AS YOU CAN
THE VIRILITY AND THE OLD AGE OF THE WORLD THE YEAR HAS PLAYED HIS PART AND KNOWS NO OTHER ART BUT TO BEGIN AGAIN IT WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME THING
I SHALL THE MORE EASILY EXCHANGE THE ONE FOR THE OTHER AND AS I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN OTHER OCCURRENCES THAT AS CAESAR SAYS
IN HIS REBUS NON ADDUNT
SURPRISED A FEW DAYS BEFORE WITH A BURNING FEVER OF WHICH HE DIED RETURNING FROM AN ENTERTAINMENT LIKE THIS WITH HIS HEAD FULL OF IDLE FANCIES OF LOVE AND JOLLITY AS MINE WAS THEN AND THAT FOR AUGHT I KNEW THE SAME DESTINY WAS ATTENDING ME
SOMNUM REDUCENT SICILIAN DAINTIES WILL NOT TICKLE THEIR PALATES NOR THE MELODY OF BIRDS AND HARPS BRING BACK SLEEP
HANGS OVER US CICERO
LET US THEREFORE AS MANY OF US AS CAN GET THIS ADVANTAGE
I DO NOT THINK HUMANITY CAPABLE OF ENDURING SUCH A CHANGE BUT NATURE LEADING US BY THE HAND AN EASY AND AS IT WERE AN INSENSIBLE PACE STEP BY STEP CONDUCTS US TO THAT MISERABLE STATE
TIS NO WONDER IF HE BE OFTEN TRAPPED IN THE PITFALL THEY AFFRIGHT PEOPLE WITH THE VERY MENTION OF DEATH AND MANY CROSS THEMSELVES AS IT WERE THE NAME OF THE DEVIL AND BECAUSE THE MAKING A MAN'S WILL IS IN REFERENCE TO DYING
FOR WHY SHOULD WE FEAR TO LOSE A THING WHICH BEING LOST CANNOT BE LAMENTED BUT ALSO SEEING WE ARE THREATENED BY SO MANY SORTS OF DEATH
FOR WHAT HUMAN MEANS WILL EVER ATTAIN ITS ENJOYMENT THE MOST PERFECT HAVE BEEN FAIN TO CONTENT THEMSELVES TO ASPIRE UNTO IT AND TO APPROACH IT ONLY WITHOUT EVER POSSESSING IT BUT THEY ARE DECEIVED
IT CONTRIBUTES NO MORE TO THY DISSOLUTION THAN EVERY ONE OF THE REST
THY AGE MAY NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED YET THY LIFE IS A MAN OF LOW STATURE IS AS MUCH A MAN AS A GIANT NEITHER MEN NOR THEIR LIVES ARE MEASURED BY THE ELL
SO INFINITELY EXCEED ALL MANNER OF IMAGINATION
HOW MANY SEVERAL WAYS HAS DEATH TO SURPRISE US
THIRTY ONE THAT TO STUDY PHILOSOPHY IS NOTHING BUT TO PREPARE ONE'S SELF TO DIE THE REASON OF WHICH IS
OUR BEDS ENVIRONED WITH PHYSICIANS AND DIVINES IN SUM NOTHING BUT GHOSTLINESS AND HORROR ROUND ABOUT US WE SEEM DEAD AND BURIED ALREADY
AND TO BEGIN TO DEPRIVE HIM OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE HE HAS OVER US LET US TAKE A WAY QUITE CONTRARY TO THE COMMON COURSE LET US DISARM HIM OF HIS NOVELTY AND STRANGENESS LET US CONVERSE AND BE FAMILIAR WITH HIM
WHILST CAIUS JULIUS THE PHYSICIAN WAS ANOINTING THE EYES OF A PATIENT DEATH CLOSED HIS OWN AND IF I MAY BRING IN AN EXAMPLE OF MY OWN BLOOD A BROTHER OF MINE CAPTAIN SAINT MARTIN A YOUNG MAN
WHEREVER YOUR LIFE ENDS IT IS ALL THERE THE UTILITY OF LIVING CONSISTS NOT IN THE LENGTH OF DAYS BUT IN THE USE OF TIME A MAN MAY HAVE LIVED LONG AND YET LIVED BUT A LITTLE
THE TIME YOU LEAVE BEHIND WAS NO MORE YOURS THAN THAT WAS LAPSED AND GONE BEFORE YOU CAME INTO THE WORLD NOR DOES IT ANY MORE CONCERN YOU
SO IT IS MY CUSTOM TO HAVE DEATH NOT ONLY IN MY IMAGINATION BUT CONTINUALLY IN MY MOUTH NEITHER IS THERE ANYTHING OF WHICH I AM SO INQUISITIVE AND DELIGHT TO INFORM MYSELF AS THE MANNER OF MEN'S DEATHS THEIR WORDS LOOKS AND BEARING
THE LATE MONSIEUR SUCH AND SUCH A ONE
SHALL I EXCHANGE FOR YOU THIS BEAUTIFUL CONTEXTURE OF THINGS TIS THE CONDITION OF YOUR CREATION DEATH IS A PART OF YOU AND WHILST YOU ENDEAVOUR TO EVADE IT YOU EVADE YOURSELVES
BY REASON THAT I BEGIN TO LOSE THE USE AND PLEASURE OF THEM BY SO MUCH I LOOK UPON DEATH WITH LESS TERROR WHICH MAKES ME HOPE
FOR MY PART I AM THANKS BE TO GOD AT THIS INSTANT IN SUCH A CONDITION THAT I AM READY TO DISLODGE WHENEVER IT SHALL PLEASE HIM WITHOUT REGRET FOR ANYTHING WHATSOEVER
AND YET THERE IS NO JOURNEY BUT HATH ITS END AND IF COMPANY WILL MAKE IT MORE PLEASANT OR MORE EASY TO YOU DOES NOT ALL THE WORLD GO THE SELF SAME WAY
NOR FIND ANYTHING ELSE TO PLEASE YOU TIS THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN
HAVING HEARD OF METHUSELAH DOES NOT THINK HE HAS YET TWENTY GOOD YEARS TO COME FOOL THAT THOU ART
MENSIS IT WAS FORMERLY THE CUSTOM TO ENLIVEN BANQUETS WITH SLAUGHTER AND TO COMBINE WITH THE REPAST THE DIRE SPECTACLE OF MEN CONTENDING WITH THE SWORD
NOR SHALL YOU SO MUCH AS WISH FOR THE LIFE YOU ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT
THE END OF OUR RACE IS DEATH TIS THE NECESSARY OBJECT OF OUR AIM WHICH IF IT FRIGHT US
AND WITH HOW MANY DANGERS IT THREATENS IT THE EGYPTIANS WERE WONT TO DO AFTER THIS MANNER WHO IN THE HEIGHT OF THEIR FEASTING AND MIRTH CAUSED A DRIED SKELETON OF A MAN TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE ROOM TO SERVE FOR A MEMENTO TO THEIR GUESTS
CHILDREN ARE AFRAID EVEN OF THOSE THEY ARE BEST ACQUAINTED WITH WHEN DISGUISED IN A VISOR AND SO TIS WITH US THE VISOR MUST BE REMOVED AS WELL FROM THINGS AS FROM PERSONS
THOU FANCIEST THEN THAT THOU ART YET ALIVE SENECA
AND THAT YOU MIGHT BE SO ESTABLISHED IN THIS MODERATION AS NEITHER TO NAUSEATE LIFE NOR HAVE ANY ANTIPATHY FOR DYING WHICH I HAVE DECREED YOU SHALL ONCE DO I HAVE TEMPERED THE ONE AND THE OTHER BETWIXT PLEASURE AND PAIN
NEITHER CAN IT ANY WAY CONCERN YOU WHETHER YOU ARE LIVING OR DEAD LIVING BY REASON THAT YOU ARE STILL IN BEING DEAD BECAUSE YOU ARE NO MORE MOREOVER NO ONE DIES BEFORE HIS HOUR
FORASMUCH AS THE FALL IS NOT SO GREAT FROM AN UNEASY BEING TO NONE AT ALL
DEATH IS LESS TO BE FEARED THAN NOTHING IF THERE COULD BE ANYTHING LESS THAN NOTHING MULTO
THINK EACH DAY WHEN PAST IS THY LAST THE NEXT DAY AS UNEXPECTED
MUCH MORE APTLY THAN IN VOLUPTUOUSNESS THEY ENNOBLE SHARPEN AND HEIGHTEN THE PERFECT AND DIVINE PLEASURE THEY PROCURE US HE RENDERS HIMSELF UNWORTHY OF IT WHO WILL COUNTERPOISE ITS COST WITH ITS FRUIT
AS ALSO BECAUSE AT THE WORST DEATH CAN WHENEVER WE PLEASE CUT SHORT AND PUT AN END TO ALL OTHER INCONVENIENCES BUT AS TO DEATH IT IS INEVITABLE OMNES EODEM COGIMUR
FOR THERE IS NO LONG NOR SHORT TO THINGS THAT ARE NO MORE ARISTOTLE TELLS US THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN LITTLE BEASTS UPON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER HYPANIS THAT NEVER LIVE ABOVE A DAY
LET THE PHILOSOPHERS SAY WHAT THEY WILL THE THING AT WHICH WE ALL AIM EVEN IN VIRTUE IS PLEASURE IT AMUSES ME TO RATTLE IN EARS THIS WORD WHICH THEY SO NAUSEATE TO AND IF IT SIGNIFY SOME SUPREME PLEASURE AND CONTENTMENT
PRESENTLY THE PRESENT WILL HAVE GONE NEVER TO BE RECALLED LUCRETIUS III
I WOULD ALWAYS HAVE A MAN TO BE DOING AND AS MUCH AS IN HIM LIES TO EXTEND AND SPIN OUT THE OFFICES OF LIFE AND THEN LET DEATH TAKE ME PLANTING MY CABBAGES INDIFFERENT TO HIM AND STILL LESS OF MY GARDENS NOT BEING FINISHED
NUGAS LET US SKIP OVER THOSE SUBTLE TRIFLES
WATER EARTH AIR AND FIRE AND THE OTHER PARTS OF THIS CREATION OF MINE ARE NO MORE INSTRUMENTS OF THY LIFE THAN THEY ARE OF THY DEATH WHY DOST THOU FEAR THY LAST DAY
IT DOES NOT CONFESS IT EVERY DAY TRAVELS TOWARDS DEATH THE LAST ONLY ARRIVES AT IT THESE ARE THE GOOD LESSONS OUR MOTHER NATURE TEACHES
YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT GO YOUR WAY SATISFIED
IF THE DEATH BE SUDDEN AND VIOLENT WE HAVE NOT LEISURE TO FEAR IF OTHERWISE I PERCEIVE THAT AS I ENGAGE FURTHER IN MY DISEASE
NEITHER HEALTH WHICH I HAVE HITHERTO EVER ENJOYED VERY STRONG AND VIGOROUS AND VERY SELDOM INTERRUPTED DOES PROLONG NOR SICKNESS CONTRACT MY HOPES EVERY MINUTE METHINKS I AM ESCAPING
WHY DOST THOU COMPLAIN OF ME AND OF DESTINY DO WE DO THEE ANY WRONG IS IT FOR THEE TO GOVERN US OR FOR US TO GOVERN THEE THOUGH PERADVENTURE
DOES NOT ALL THE WORLD DANCE THE SAME BRAWL THAT YOU DO IS THERE ANYTHING THAT DOES NOT GROW OLD AS WELL AS YOU A THOUSAND MEN A THOUSAND ANIMALS A THOUSAND OTHER CREATURES DIE AT THE SAME MOMENT THAT YOU DIE
I SAW ONE DIE WHO AT HIS LAST GASP COMPLAINED OF NOTHING SO MUCH AS THAT DESTINY WAS ABOUT TO CUT THE THREAD OF A CHRONICLE HE WAS THEN COMPILING WHEN HE WAS GONE NO FARTHER THAN THE FIFTEENTH OR SIXTEENTH OF OUR KINGS
I HAVE FOUND THAT BEING WELL I HAVE HAD MALADIES IN MUCH GREATER HORROR THAN WHEN REALLY AFFLICTED WITH THEM
DIED WITHIN FIVE OR SIX HOURS AFTER OF AN APOPLEXY OCCASIONED BY THAT BLOW THESE SO FREQUENT AND COMMON EXAMPLES PASSING EVERY DAY BEFORE OUR EYES
THERE IS MORE IN THEM OF OPPOSITION AND OBSTINACY THAN IS CONSISTENT WITH SO SACRED A PROFESSION BUT WHATSOEVER PERSONAGE A MAN TAKES UPON HIMSELF TO PERFORM HE EVER MIXES HIS OWN PART WITH IT
THIS VERY SUN THIS MOON THESE VERY STARS THIS VERY ORDER AND DISPOSITION OF THINGS IS THE SAME YOUR ANCESTORS ENJOYED AND THAT SHALL ALSO ENTERTAIN YOUR POSTERITY
IS ONLY THE MORE SERIOUSLY VOLUPTUOUS
AND YET I WILL PLACE YOU IN SUCH A CONDITION AS YOU SHALL HAVE NO REASON TO BE DISPLEASED
FIFTY ONE AND AS THE EGYPTIANS AFTER THEIR FEASTS WERE WONT TO PRESENT THE COMPANY WITH A GREAT IMAGE OF DEATH BY ONE THAT CRIED OUT TO THEM DRINK AND BE MERRY FOR SUCH SHALT THOU BE WHEN THOU ART DEAD
THE FELICITY AND BEATITUDE THAT GLITTERS IN VIRTUE SHINES THROUGHOUT ALL HER APPURTENANCES AND AVENUES EVEN TO THE FIRST ENTRY AND UTMOST LIMITS NOW
YOUR GRANDSIRES SAW NO OTHER THING NOR WILL YOUR POSTERITY
ALL THE WHOLE TIME YOU LIVE YOU PURLOIN FROM LIFE AND LIVE AT THE EXPENSE OF LIFE ITSELF THE PERPETUAL WORK OF YOUR LIFE IS BUT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION OF DEATH YOU ARE IN DEATH WHILST YOU ARE IN LIFE
CICERO SAYS
AND THE BUILDER
BECAUSE SAID HE IT IS INDIFFERENT
AND IT IS MANIFEST ENOUGH BY MY CROWDING IN EXAMPLES OF THIS KIND THAT I HAVE A PARTICULAR FANCY FOR THAT SUBJECT IF I WERE A WRITER OF BOOKS I WOULD COMPILE A REGISTER WITH A COMMENT OF THE VARIOUS DEATHS OF MEN HE WHO SHOULD TEACH MEN TO DIE
EPULIS SPECTACULA DIRA
THAT BEING TAKEN AWAY WE SHALL FIND NOTHING UNDERNEATH BUT THE VERY SAME DEATH THAT A MEAN SERVANT OR A POOR CHAMBERMAID DIED A DAY OR TWO AGO WITHOUT ANY MANNER OF APPREHENSION
WHY FOR SO SHORT A LIFE TEASE OURSELVES WITH SO MANY PROJECTS
BECAUSE I WAS NOT CERTAIN TO LIVE TILL I CAME HOME AS A MAN THAT AM ETERNALLY BROODING OVER MY OWN THOUGHTS AND CONFINE THEM TO MY OWN PARTICULAR CONCERNS I AM AT ALL HOURS AS WELL PREPARED AS I AM EVER LIKE TO BE AND DEATH WHENEVER HE SHALL COME
AND MOREOVER HAS PARTICULAR TO ITSELF SO MANY SEVERAL SORTS OF SHARP AND WOUNDING PASSIONS AND SO DULL A SATIETY ATTENDING IT AS EQUAL IT TO THE SEVEREST PENANCE
THERE IS NOTHING EVIL IN LIFE FOR HIM WHO RIGHTLY COMPREHENDS THAT THE PRIVATION OF LIFE IS NO EVIL TO KNOW HOW TO DIE DELIVERS US FROM ALL SUBJECTION AND CONSTRAINT
SIXTEEN CAESAR TO AN OLD WEATHER BEATEN SOLDIER OF HIS GUARDS WHO CAME TO ASK HIM LEAVE THAT HE MIGHT KILL HIMSELF TAKING NOTICE OF HIS WITHERED BODY AND DECREPIT MOTION PLEASANTLY ANSWERED
EIGHTEEN OUR COURTS OF JUSTICE OFTEN SEND BACK CONDEMNED CRIMINALS TO BE EXECUTED UPON THE PLACE WHERE THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BUT CARRY THEM TO FINE HOUSES BY THE WAY PREPARE FOR THEM THE BEST ENTERTAINMENT YOU CAN
AND THIS BRUTISH NEGLIGENCE COULD IT POSSIBLY LODGE IN THE BRAIN OF ANY MAN OF SENSE
I FIND I HAVE MUCH MORE ADO TO DIGEST THIS RESOLUTION OF DYING WHEN I AM WELL IN HEALTH THAN WHEN LANGUISHING OF A FEVER AND BY HOW MUCH I HAVE LESS TO DO WITH THE COMMODITIES OF LIFE
TO WHAT END SHOULD YOU ENDEAVOUR TO DRAW BACK IF THERE BE NO POSSIBILITY TO EVADE IT YOU HAVE SEEN EXAMPLES ENOUGH OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WELL PLEASED TO DIE AS THEREBY DELIVERED FROM HEAVY MISERIES
HOW NATURE DEPRIVES US OF THE LIGHT AND SENSE OF OUR BODILY DECAY WHAT REMAINS TO AN OLD MAN OF THE VIGOUR OF HIS YOUTH AND BETTER DAYS
AT OUR EASE ALL THE OPINIONS OF THE WORLD AGREE IN THIS THAT PLEASURE IS OUR END THOUGH WE MAKE USE OF DIVERS MEANS TO ATTAIN IT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE REJECTED AT THE FIRST MOTION
AND NEITHER UNDERSTANDS THE BLESSING NOR HOW TO USE IT THOSE WHO PREACH TO US THAT THE QUEST OF IT IS CRAGGY DIFFICULT AND PAINFUL BUT ITS FRUITION PLEASANT WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY THAT BUT TO TELL US THAT IT IS ALWAYS UNPLEASING
AND EMPLOY IT SEPARATELY FROM THE BODY WHICH IS A KIND OF APPRENTICESHIP AND A RESEMBLANCE OF DEATH OR ELSE BECAUSE ALL THE WISDOM AND REASONING IN THE WORLD DO IN THE END CONCLUDE IN THIS POINT TO TEACH US NOT TO FEAR TO DIE
AND IT ETERNALLY RUNS IN MY MIND THAT WHAT MAY BE DONE TO MORROW MAY BE DONE TO DAY HAZARDS AND DANGERS DO IN TRUTH LITTLE OR NOTHING HASTEN OUR END AND IF WE CONSIDER HOW MANY THOUSANDS MORE REMAIN AND HANG OVER OUR HEADS
LET US PRESENTLY CONSIDER AND SAY TO OURSELVES WELL AND WHAT IF IT HAD BEEN DEATH ITSELF AND THEREUPON LET US ENCOURAGE AND FORTIFY OURSELVES LET US EVERMORE AMIDST OUR JOLLITY AND FEASTING
I DISENGAGE MYSELF THROUGHOUT FROM ALL WORLDLY RELATIONS MY LEAVE IS SOON TAKEN OF ALL BUT MYSELF NEVER DID ANY ONE PREPARE TO BID ADIEU TO THE WORLD MORE ABSOLUTELY AND UNRESERVEDLY
TO PREMEDITATE IS DOUBTLESS A VERY GREAT ADVANTAGE AND BESIDES IS IT NOTHING TO GO SO FAR AT LEAST WITHOUT DISTURBANCE OR ALTERATION MOREOVER NATURE HERSELF ASSISTS AND ENCOURAGES US
LIFE IN ITSELF IS NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL IT IS THE SCENE OF GOOD OR EVIL AS YOU MAKE IT AND IF YOU HAVE LIVED A DAY YOU HAVE SEEN ALL ONE DAY IS EQUAL AND LIKE TO ALL OTHER DAYS
DO BUT SERIOUSLY CONSIDER HOW MUCH MORE INSUPPORTABLE AND PAINFUL AN IMMORTAL LIFE WOULD BE TO MAN THAN WHAT I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN HIM IF YOU HAD NOT DEATH YOU WOULD ETERNALLY CURSE ME FOR HAVING DEPRIVED YOU OF IT
WRETCH THAT I AM THEY CRY ONE FATAL DAY HAS DEPRIVED ME OF ALL JOYS OF LIFE
SILIUS ITALICUS
SO IN OUR DEATH IS THE DEATH OF ALL THINGS INCLUDED AND THEREFORE TO LAMENT THAT WE SHALL NOT BE ALIVE A HUNDRED YEARS HENCE IS THE SAME FOLLY AS TO BE SORRY WE WERE NOT ALIVE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO DEATH IS THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER LIFE
CAN BRING NOTHING ALONG WITH HIM I DID NOT EXPECT LONG BEFORE WE SHOULD ALWAYS AS NEAR AS WE CAN BE BOOTED AND SPURRED AND READY TO GO AND ABOVE ALL THINGS TAKE CARE AT THAT TIME TO HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH ANY ONE BUT ONE'S SELF
FOR WE SHALL THERE FIND WORK ENOUGH TO DO WITHOUT ANY NEED OF ADDITION ONE MAN COMPLAINS MORE THAN OF DEATH THAT HE IS THEREBY PREVENTED OF A GLORIOUS VICTORY
I HAVE MIXED A LITTLE BITTERNESS WITH IT
WHY NOT DEPART FROM LIFE AS A SATED GUEST FROM A FEAST
SET THE REMEMBRANCE OF OUR FRAIL CONDITION BEFORE OUR EYES NEVER SUFFERING OURSELVES TO BE SO FAR TRANSPORTED WITH OUR DELIGHTS BUT THAT WE HAVE SOME INTERVALS OF REFLECTING UPON AND CONSIDERING HOW MANY SEVERAL WAYS THIS JOLLITY OF OURS TENDS TO DEATH
THE BODY BENT AND BOWED HAS LESS FORCE TO SUPPORT A BURDEN AND IT IS THE SAME WITH THE SOUL AND THEREFORE IT IS THAT WE ARE TO RAISE HER UP FIRM AND ERECT AGAINST THE POWER OF THIS ADVERSARY FOR
AS IN NATURE ONE CONTRARY IS QUICKENED BY ANOTHER OR SAY WHEN WE COME TO VIRTUE THAT LIKE CONSEQUENCES AND DIFFICULTIES OVERWHELM AND RENDER IT AUSTERE AND INACCESSIBLE WHEREAS
FOR WHO WOULD GIVE EAR TO HIM THAT SHOULD PROPOSE AFFLICTION AND MISERY FOR HIS END THE CONTROVERSIES AND DISPUTES OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL SECTS UPON THIS POINT ARE MERELY VERBAL TRANSCURRAMUS SOLERTISSIMAS
AND MORE SENSIBLY AND ESSENTIALLY
YET DID NOT THIS THOUGHT WRINKLE MY FOREHEAD ANY MORE THAN ANY OTHER IT IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT WE MUST FEEL A STING IN SUCH IMAGINATIONS AS THESE AT FIRST BUT WITH OFTEN TURNING AND RETURNING THEM IN ONE'S MIND THEY AT LAST
WHERE DEATH WAITS FOR US IS UNCERTAIN LET US LOOK FOR HIM EVERYWHERE THE PREMEDITATION OF DEATH IS THE PREMEDITATION OF LIBERTY HE WHO HAS LEARNED TO DIE HAS UNLEARNED TO SERVE
RECKON UP THY ACQUAINTANCE HOW MANY MORE HAVE DIED BEFORE THEY ARRIVED AT THY AGE THAN HAVE ATTAINED UNTO IT
AND TO SAY THE TRUTH EITHER OUR REASON MOCKS US OR IT OUGHT TO HAVE NO OTHER AIM BUT OUR CONTENTMENT ONLY NOR TO ENDEAVOUR ANYTHING BUT IN SUM TO MAKE US LIVE WELL AND AS THE HOLY SCRIPTURE SAYS
THAN ONCE TO UNDERGO ONE OF THEM AND WHAT MATTERS IT
NOT THE MENACING LOOK OF A TYRANT SHAKES HER WELL SETTLED SOUL NOR TURBULENT AUSTER THE PRINCE OF THE STORMY ADRIATIC NOR YET THE STRONG HAND OF THUNDERING JOVE SUCH A TEMPER MOVES
THE VISITS OF ASTOUNDED AND AFFLICTED FRIENDS THE ATTENDANCE OF PALE AND BLUBBERING SERVANTS
NOT A MAN WILL BE PERSUADED TO TAKE A PEN IN HAND TO THAT PURPOSE TILL THE PHYSICIAN HAS PASSED SENTENCE UPON AND TOTALLY GIVEN HIM OVER AND THEN BETWIXT AND TERROR GOD KNOWS IN HOW FIT A CONDITION
THE REMEDY THE VULGAR USE IS NOT TO THINK ON'T BUT FROM WHAT BRUTISH STUPIDITY CAN THEY DERIVE SO GROSS A BLINDNESS THEY MUST BRIDLE THE ASS BY THE TAIL
AND BY THAT MEANS MAKES IT FAMILIAR TO US SO THAT WE ARE INSENSIBLE OF THE STROKE WHEN OUR YOUTH DIES IN US THOUGH IT BE REALLY A HARDER DEATH THAN THE FINAL DISSOLUTION OF A LANGUISHING BODY THAN THE DEATH OF OLD AGE
FOR IF IT WERE NOT SO IT WOULD BE AN ARMY OF DOCTORS AND WHINING MILKSOPS AND THAT BEING STILL IN ALL PLACES THE SAME THERE SHOULD BE NOTWITHSTANDING MUCH MORE ASSURANCE IN PEASANTS AND THE MEANER SORT OF PEOPLE THAN IN OTHERS OF BETTER QUALITY
WITHOUT WHICH ALL OTHER PLEASURE WOULD BE EXTINCT WHICH IS THE REASON WHY ALL THE RULES CENTRE AND CONCUR IN THIS ONE ARTICLE AND ALTHOUGH THEY ALL IN LIKE MANNER WITH COMMON ACCORD TEACH US ALSO TO DESPISE PAIN
AS IN A SUSPECTED COUNTRY QUAE QUASI SAXUM TANTALO SEMPER IMPENDET EVER
FOR ANYTHING I HAVE TO DO BEFORE I DIE THE LONGEST LEISURE WOULD APPEAR TOO SHORT WERE IT BUT AN HOUR'S BUSINESS I HAD TO DO A FRIEND OF MINE THE OTHER DAY TURNING OVER MY TABLETS FOUND THEREIN A MEMORANDUM OF SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE DONE AFTER MY DECEASE
ANXIETY OR FEAR OR ANY OTHER DISTURBANCE SHOULD INHABIT OR HAVE ANY PLACE IN HER NON VULNUS INSTANTS TYRANNI
WOULD AT THE SAME TIME TEACH THEM TO LIVE DICARCHUS MADE ONE TO WHICH HE GAVE THAT TITLE BUT IT WAS DESIGNED FOR ANOTHER AND LESS PROFITABLE END PERADVENTURE SOME ONE MAY OBJECT THAT THE PAIN AND TERROR OF DYING
I HAVE DECIDED TO APPOINT YOU AS GUIDE AND CHIEF OF SCOUTS WITH THE COMMAND HOW DOES THAT SUIT YOU FIRST RATE GENERAL AND THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR I REPLIED AS GRACEFULLY AS I KNEW HOW
FOR THEY KNEW NOT WHERE THEY WERE THEMSELVES HAVING LEARNED THAT GENERAL PENROSE'S TROOPS WERE IN SUCH BAD SHAPE GENERAL CARR ORDERED MAJOR BROWN TO START OUT THE NEXT MORNING WITH TWO COMPANIES OF CAVALRY AND FIFTY PACK MULES LOADED WITH PROVISIONS
ROUNDING UP INDIANS IN OCTOBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN GENERAL SHERIDAN ORGANIZED AN EXPEDITION TO OPERATE AGAINST THE INDIANS WHO INFESTED THE REPUBLICAN RIVER REGION CODY SAID HE
WERE GOOD ON THE HOLD BACK AND WE GOT ALONG FINELY UNTIL WE NEARLY REACHED THE BOTTOM WHEN THE WAGON CROWDED THE MULES SO HARD
WE ARRIVED AT THE CIMARRON AT SUNDOWN AND WENT INTO CAMP UPON LOOKING AROUND NEXT MORNING WE FOUND THAT PENROSE HAVING BEEN UNENCUMBERED BY WAGONS HAD KEPT ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE CIMARRON
BUT KNOWING THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW DOWN THE RIVER GENERAL CARR CONCLUDED TO TAKE THE BEST WAGON ROUTE ALONG THE STREAM WHICH I DISCOVERED TO BE ON THE EAST SIDE BEFORE WE COULD MAKE ANY HEADWAY WITH OUR WAGON TRAIN WE HAD TO LEAVE THE RIVER AND GET OUT ON THE DIVIDE
BUT BEFORE MORNING WE WERE AROUSED FROM OUR SLUMBERS BY HEARING SHOTS FIRED AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD ONE OF THE MOUNTED PICKETS CAME GALLOPING INTO CAMP SAYING THAT THERE WERE INDIANS CLOSE AT HAND THE COMPANIES ALL FELL INTO LINE
GENERAL CARR CONCLUDED FROM WHAT THEY COULD TELL HIM
WHICH WE REACHED THREE DAYS AFTERWARD AND WHERE WE REMAINED SEVERAL DAYS VERY SOON AFTER GENERAL CARR RECEIVED ORDERS FROM GENERAL SHERIDAN FOR A WINTER'S CAMPAIGN IN THE CANADIAN RIVER COUNTRY INSTRUCTING HIM TO PROCEED AT ONCE TO FORT LYON COLORADO
AS SHURE EZ ME NAME'S PAT MALONEY ONE OF THEM REDSKINS HIT ME ON THE HEAD WITH A CLUB SO HE DID SAID PAT AND SO WHEN MORNING CAME THE MYSTERY WAS FURTHER INVESTIGATED AND WAS EASILY SOLVED ELK TRACKS WERE FOUND IN THE VICINITY
I HEARD SOME ONE CALLING MY NAME FROM A LITTLE BUNCH OF WILLOW BRUSH ON THE OPPOSITE BANK AND UPON LOOKING CLOSELY AT THE SPOT I SAW A NEGRO SAKES ALIVE MASSA BILL AM DAT YOU ASKED THE MAN
DAR'S MASSA BUFFALO BILL THEN HE SANG OUT MASSA BILL IS YOU GOT ANY HAWDTACK NARY A HARDTACK BUT THE WAGONS WILL BE ALONG PRESENTLY AND THEN YOU CAN GET ALL YOU WANT SAID I
GENERAL CARR THEN WENT BACK TO HIS CAMP AND SOON AFTERWARD OUR WAGON TRAIN CAME IN FROM FORT LYON WITH A FRESH LOAD OF PROVISIONS
CONSISTING OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED LODGES AND WE PUSHED FORWARD RAPIDLY FROM THIS POINT ON THE TRAIL WHICH RAN BACK TOWARD PRAIRIE DOG CREEK ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK WE CAME IN SIGHT OF THE RETREATING VILLAGE AND SOON THE WARRIORS TURNED BACK TO GIVE US BATTLE
AND ALSO SOME MOUNTED WARRIORS WHO COULD SEE ME AND WHO KEPT BLAZING AWAY WITH THEIR GUNS THE TWO INDIANS WHO HAD FIRED AT ME AND HAD KILLED MY HORSE WERE RETREATING ACROSS THE CREEK ON A BEAVER DAM I SENT A FEW SHOTS AFTER THEM TO ACCELERATE THEIR SPEED
I REPLIED THAT IT WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES AND HE SAID HE WOULD MAKE IT THE NEXT DAY GETTING AN EARLY START IN THE MORNING WE STRUCK OUT ACROSS THE PRAIRIE MY POSITION AS GUIDE BEING AHEAD OF THE ADVANCE GUARD ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK GENERAL CARR OVERTOOK ME
WE DISCOVERED A LARGE FRESH INDIAN TRAIL WHICH WE HURRIEDLY FOLLOWED FOR A DISTANCE OF EIGHT MILES WHEN SUDDENLY WE SAW ON THE BLUFFS AHEAD OF US QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIANS GENERAL CARR ORDERED LIEUTENANT PEPOON'S SCOUTS AND COMPANY M TO THE FRONT
SAID I WE CAN NEVER DO IT IT'S TOO STEEP THE WAGONS WILL RUN OVER THE MULES
THE MULES HAVE GOT TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY WAS MY REPLY I TOLD WILSON THE CHIEF WAGON MASTER TO BRING ON HIS MESS WAGON WHICH WAS AT THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN AND I WOULD TRY THE EXPERIMENT AT LEAST WILSON DROVE THE TEAM AND WAGON TO THE BRINK OF THE HILL
MAJOR BROWN CAPTAIN SWEETMAN LIEUTENANT BACHE AND MYSELF WERE TAKING SUPPER TOGETHER WHEN WHANG CAME A BULLET INTO LIEUTENANT BACHE'S PLATE BREAKING A HOLE THROUGH IT THE BULLET CAME FROM THE GUN OF ONE OF THE INDIANS WHO HAD RETURNED TO THE HIGH BLUFF OVERLOOKING OUR CAMP
BUT YOU CAN NEVER TAKE THE TRAIN DOWN SAID HE NEVER YOU MIND THE TRAIN GENERAL YOU SAY YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD CAMP HOW DOES THAT BEAUTIFUL SPOT DOWN IN THE VALLEY SUIT YOU I ASKED HIM THAT WILL DO I CAN EASILY DESCEND WITH THE CAVALRY
WHOM I RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE COLORED SOLDIERS OF THE TENTH CAVALRY I NEXT HEARD HIM SAY TO SOME ONE IN THE BRUSH
IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE CAMP A LIGHT WAS STILL BURNING IN THE GENERAL'S TENT HE HAVING REMAINED AWAKE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING MY RETURN HE WAS GLAD TO SEE ME AND WAS OVERJOYED AT THE INFORMATION I BROUGHT
UNTIL HE WAS SUPPORTED BY OUR FULL FORCE THE INDIANS KEPT INCREASING IN NUMBERS ALL THE WHILE UNTIL IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT WE WERE FIGHTING FROM EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND OF THEM THE ENGAGEMENT BECAME QUITE GENERAL AND SEVERAL WERE KILLED AND WOUNDED ON EACH SIDE
AND WERE SOON PREPARED AND ANXIOUS TO GIVE THE REDSKINS BATTLE BUT AS THE MEN WERE YET NEW IN THE INDIAN COUNTRY A GREAT MANY OF THEM WERE CONSIDERABLY EXCITED NO INDIANS HOWEVER MADE THEIR APPEARANCE
WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THAT DAY IN FINDING A SPLENDID ROAD FOR SOME DISTANCE UNTIL WE WERE ALL AT ONCE BROUGHT TO A STANDSTILL ON A HIGH TABLELAND OVERLOOKING A BEAUTIFUL WINDING CREEK THAT LAY FAR BELOW US IN THE VALLEY THE QUESTION THAT TROUBLED US
SAID THE DARKY WE GOT LOST AND WE'S BEEN STARVIN EBER SINCE BY THIS TIME TWO OTHER NEGROES HAD EMERGED FROM THEIR PLACE OF CONCEALMENT THEY HAD DESERTED PENROSE'S COMMAND WHICH WAS OUT OF RATIONS AND NEARLY IN A STARVING CONDITION AND WERE TRYING TO MAKE THEIR WAY BACK TO FORT LYON
WE HAD NO TROUBLE IN FOLLOWING PENROSE'S TRAIL WHICH LED US IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION TOWARD THE CANADIAN RIVER NO INDIANS WERE SEEN NOR ANY SIGNS OF THEM FOUND ONE DAY WHILE RIDING IN ADVANCE OF THE COMMAND DOWN SAN FRANCISCO CREEK
MAJOR BROWN DECLARED IT WAS A CRACK SHOT BECAUSE IT BROKE THE PLATE WE FINISHED OUR SUPPER WITHOUT HAVING ANY MORE SUCH CLOSE CALLS AT DAYLIGHT NEXT MORNING WE STRUCK OUT ON THE TRAIL AND SOON CAME TO THE SPOT WHERE THE INDIANS HAD CAMPED THE DAY BEFORE WE COULD SEE THAT THEIR VILLAGE WAS A VERY LARGE ONE
NO DANGER OF THAT SAID I AND THEN I RODE ON LEAVING HIM TO RETURN TO THE COMMAND AS I HAD PREDICTED WE FOUND WATER SEVEN OR EIGHT MILES FARTHER ON WHERE WE CAME UPON A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE STREAM A TRIBUTARY OF THE BEAVER HIDDEN IN THE HILLS
MAJOR BROWN WITH TWO COMPANIES AND THREE DAYS RATIONS PUSHING AHEAD IN ADVANCE OF THE MAIN COMMAND BEING UNSUCCESSFUL HOWEVER IN OVERTAKING THE INDIANS AND GETTING NEARLY OUT OF PROVISIONS IT BEING OUR EIGHTEENTH DAY OUT
WHICH COMPELLED US TO GO INTO CAMP FOR A DAY THE GROUND NOW BEING COVERED WITH SNOW WE FOUND IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW PENROSE'S TRAIL ANY FARTHER ESPECIALLY AS HE HAD LEFT NO SIGN TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION HE WAS GOING GENERAL CARR SENT FOR ME
THEY WERE A WARLIKE BODY OF WELL BUILT DARING AND RESTLESS BRAVES AND WERE DETERMINED TO HOLD POSSESSION OF THE COUNTRY IN THE VICINITY OF THE REPUBLICAN AND SOLOMON RIVERS THEY WERE CALLED DOG SOLDIERS BECAUSE THEY WERE PRINCIPALLY CHEYENNES
THE ENTIRE COMMAND MARCHED TOWARD THE NEAREST RAILWAY POINT AND CAMPED ON THE SALINE RIVER DISTANT THREE MILES FROM BUFFALO TANK WHILE WAITING FOR SUPPLIES WE RECEIVED A NEW COMMANDING OFFICER BREVET MAJOR GENERAL E A CARR
IT HAVING BEEN ATTACKED A FEW HOURS PREVIOUSLY BY A PARTY OF INDIANS WHO HAD SUCCEEDED IN KILLING TWO MEN AND IN MAKING OFF WITH SIXTY HORSES BELONGING TO COMPANY H THAT EVENING THE COMMAND STARTED ON THE TRAIL OF THESE INDIAN HORSE THIEVES
I STARTED OUT IN THE BLINDING SNOWSTORM TAKING A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION WE RODE TWENTY FOUR MILES AND UPON REACHING A TRIBUTARY OF THE CIMARRON WE SCOUTED UP AND DOWN THE STREAM FOR A FEW MILES AND FINALLY FOUND ONE OF PENROSE'S OLD CAMPS IT WAS NOW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
FOR OVER TWO WEEKS THE MEN HAD HAD ONLY QUARTER RATIONS AND WERE NOW NEARLY STARVED TO DEATH OVER TWO HUNDRED HORSES AND MULES WERE LYING DEAD HAVING DIED FROM FATIGUE AND STARVATION GENERAL PENROSE FEARING THAT GENERAL CARR WOULD NOT FIND HIM
AND INSTEAD OF SHOOTING THEM JUST THEN I RAN THEM AT FULL SPEED RIGHT INTO THE CAMP AND THEN KILLED THEM ALL ONE AFTER ANOTHER IN RAPID SUCCESSION COLONEL ROYAL WITNESSED THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WHICH PUZZLED HIM SOMEWHAT AS HE COULD SEE NO REASON WHY I HAD NOT KILLED THEM ON THE PRAIRIE
FOUR MILES WEST OF HAYS CITY BY THIS TIME I HAD BECOME PRETTY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH MAJOR BROWN AND CAPTAIN SWEETMAN WHO INVITED ME TO MESS WITH THEM ON THIS EXPEDITION AND A JOLLY MESS WE HAD THERE WERE OTHER SCOUTS IN THE COMMAND BESIDES MYSELF
THE INDIANS WERE EVIDENTLY FIGHTING TO GIVE THEIR FAMILIES AND VILLAGE A CHANCE TO GET AWAY WE HAD UNDOUBTEDLY SURPRISED THEM WITH A LARGER FORCE THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED TO SEE IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY WE FOUGHT THEM UNTIL DARK ALL THE TIME DRIVING THEM BEFORE US
WAS MY REPLY THE COLONEL SAW THE POINT IN A MOMENT AND HAD NO MORE TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT NO INDIANS HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE VICINITY DURING THE DAY AND COLONEL ROYAL HAVING CAREFULLY POSTED HIS PICKETS SUPPOSED EVERYTHING WAS SERENE FOR THE NIGHT
WE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN SELECTING A GOOD HALTING PLACE AND OBTAINING FRESH SPRING WATER AND GRASS THE GENERAL UPON LEARNING FROM ME THAT THE STREAM WHICH WAS ONLY EIGHT OR NINE MILES LONG HAD NO NAME TOOK OUT HIS MAP AND LOCATED IT
THE DOG SOLDIER INDIANS WERE A BAND OF CHEYENNES AND UNRULY TURBULENT MEMBERS OF OTHER TRIBES WHO WOULD NOT ENTER INTO ANY TREATY OR KEEP A TREATY IF THEY MADE ONE AND WHO HAD ALWAYS REFUSED TO GO UPON A RESERVATION
AND THERE TO FIT OUT FOR THE EXPEDITION LEAVING FORT WALLACE IN NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WE ARRIVED AT FORT LYON IN THE LATTER PART OF THE MONTH WITHOUT SPECIAL INCIDENT AND AT ONCE BEGAN OUR PREPARATIONS FOR INVADING THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY
THIS COMPANY WAS COMMANDED BY LIEUTENANT SCHINOSKY A FRENCHMAN BY BIRTH AND RECKLESS BY NATURE HAVING ADVANCED HIS COMPANY NEARLY A MILE AHEAD OF THE MAIN COMMAND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED INDIANS SUDDENLY CHARGED DOWN UPON HIM AND GAVE HIM A LIVELY LITTLE FIGHT
WE FOUND HOWEVER THAT THE INDIANS BY TRAVELING NIGHT AND DAY HAD GOT A LONG START AND THE GENERAL CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS USELESS TO FOLLOW THEM ANY FARTHER THE GENERAL TOLD ME THAT THE NEXT DAY'S MARCH WOULD BE TOWARD THE HEADWATERS OF THE BEAVER AND ASKED ME THE DISTANCE
AND TO MAKE ALL POSSIBLE SPEED TO REACH AND RELIEVE THE SUFFERING SOLDIERS I ACCOMPANIED THIS DETACHMENT AND ON THE THIRD DAY OUT WE FOUND THE HALF FAMISHED SOLDIERS CAMPED ON THE PALLADORA THE CAMP PRESENTED A PITIFUL SIGHT INDEED
AS THEY WERE CONTINUALLY DROPPING TEPEE POLES CAMP KETTLES ROBES FURS AND ALL HEAVY ARTICLES BELONGING TO THEM THEY WERE EVIDENTLY SCATTERING AND IT FINALLY BECAME DIFFICULT FOR US TO KEEP ON THE MAIN TRAIL WHEN DARKNESS SET IN WE WENT INTO CAMP
HE THEN PICKED OUT FIVE HUNDRED OF THE BEST MEN AND HORSES AND TAKING HIS PACK TRAIN WITH HIM STARTED SOUTH FOR THE CANADIAN RIVER LEAVING THE REST OF THE TROOPS AT THE SUPPLY CAMP FOR SEVERAL DAYS WE SCOUTED ALONG THE CANADIAN RIVER BUT FOUND NO SIGNS OF INDIANS
AND SAID THAT AS IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD NOT LOSE THE TRAIL HE WISHED THAT I WOULD TAKE SOME SCOUTS WITH ME AND WHILE THE COMMAND REMAINED IN CAMP PUSH ON AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND SEE IF I COULD NOT DISCOVER SOME TRACES OF PENROSE OR WHERE HE HAD CAMPED AT ANY TIME ACCOMPANIED BY FOUR MEN
AT NIGHT THEY ANNOYED US CONSIDERABLY BY FIRING DOWN INTO OUR CAMP FROM THE HIGHER HILLS AND SEVERAL TIMES THE COMMAND WAS ORDERED TO DISLODGE THEM FROM THEIR POSITION AND DRIVE THEM BACK AFTER HAVING RETURNED FROM ONE OF THESE SALLIES
AND FOLLOWING MY DIRECTIONS HE BROUGHT OUT SOME EXTRA CHAINS WITH WHICH WE LOCKED THE WHEELS ON EACH SIDE AND THEN ROUGH LOCKED THEM WE NOW STARTED THE WAGON DOWN THE HILL THE WHEEL HORSES OR RATHER THE WHEEL MULES
AND NAMED IT CODY'S CREEK WHICH NAME IT STILL BEARS WE PULLED OUT EARLY NEXT MORNING FOR THE BEAVER AND WHEN WE WERE APPROACHING THE STREAM I RODE ON AHEAD OF THE ADVANCE GUARD IN ORDER TO FIND THE CROSSING JUST AS I TURNED A BEND OF THE CREEK
GENERAL CARR HAVING A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHERE HE WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO FIND THEM DIRECTED ME TO GUIDE THEM BY THE NEAREST ROUTE TO ELEPHANT ROCK ON BEAVER CREEK UPON ARRIVING AT THE SOUTH FORK OF THE BEAVER ON THE SECOND DAY'S MARCH
AND UPON GOING TO THE PICKET POST WHERE THE PICKET SAID HE HAD SEEN THEM NONE COULD BE FOUND NOR COULD ANY TRACES OF THEM BE DISCOVERED THE SENTINEL WHO WAS AN IRISHMAN INSISTED THAT THERE HAD CERTAINLY BEEN REDSKINS THERE BUT YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN
WHEN GENERAL CARR CAME UP HE ORDERED COMPANY I TO GO IN PURSUIT OF THE BAND I ACCOMPANIED LIEUTENANT BRADY WHO COMMANDED AND WE HAD A RUNNING FIGHT WITH THE INDIANS LASTING SEVERAL HOURS WE CAPTURED SEVERAL HEAD OF THEIR HORSES AND MOST OF THEIR LODGES
AND ASKED ME HOW FAR I SUPPOSED IT WAS TO WATER I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT EIGHT MILES ALTHOUGH WE COULD SEE NO SIGN OR INDICATION OF ANY STREAM IN FRONT PEPOON'S SCOUTS SAY YOU ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION SAID THE GENERAL
I WAS PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO CATCH UP WITH PENROSE'S COMMAND AS MY OLD FRIEND WILD BILL WAS AMONG HIS SCOUTS WE FOLLOWED THE TRAIL VERY EASILY FOR THE FIRST THREE DAYS AND THEN WE WERE CAUGHT IN FREEZE OUT CANYON BY A FEARFUL SNOWSTORM
THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON HE AGAIN REQUESTED ME TO GO OUT AND GET SOME FRESH BUFFALO MEAT I DIDN'T ASK HIM FOR ANY WAGONS THIS TIME BUT RODE OUT SOME DISTANCE AND COMING UP WITH A SMALL HERD I MANAGED TO GET SEVEN OF THEM HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE ENCAMPMENT
THREE OTHER WAGONS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN THE SAME WAY AND IN HALF AN HOUR EVERY WAGON WAS IN CAMP WITHOUT THE LEAST ACCIDENT HAVING OCCURRED IT WAS INDEED AN EXCITING SIGHT TO SEE THE SIX MULE TEAMS COME STRAIGHT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN
THEY SET FIRE TO THE PRAIRIE GRASS IN FRONT OF US AND ON ALL SIDES IN ORDER TO DELAY US AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE KEPT UP A RUNNING FIGHT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON AND THE INDIANS REPEATEDLY ATTEMPTED TO LEAD US OFF THE TRACK OF THEIR FLYING VILLAGE BUT THEIR TRAIL WAS EASILY FOLLOWED
IT BEING USELESS TO TRY TO FOLLOW THE INDIANS AFTER NIGHTFALL NEXT MORNING WE WERE AGAIN ON THE TRAIL THE INDIANS SOON SCATTERED IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT WE FOLLOWED THE MAIN TRAIL TO THE REPUBLICAN RIVER WHERE WE MADE A CUT OFF AND THEN WENT NORTH TOWARD THE PLATTE RIVER
AT THIS ENCAMPMENT COLONEL ROYAL ASKED ME TO GO OUT AND KILL SOME BUFFALOES FOR THE BOYS ALL RIGHT COLONEL SEND ALONG A WAGON OR TWO TO BRING IN THE MEAT I SAID I AM NOT IN THE HABIT OF SENDING OUT MY WAGONS UNTIL I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE HAULED IN
GENERAL CARR UPON ARRIVING WITH HIS FORCE TOOK COMMAND OF ALL THE TROOPS HE BEING THE SENIOR OFFICER AND RANKING GENERAL PENROSE AFTER SELECTING A GOOD CAMP HE UNLOADED THE WAGONS AND SENT THEM BACK TO FORT LYON FOR FRESH SUPPLIES
HE AT ONCE ORDERED THE COMMAND TO DISMOUNT AND LEAD THE HORSES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THE WAGON TRAIN WAS A MILE IN THE REAR AND WHEN IT CAME UP ONE OF THE DRIVERS ASKED HOW ARE WE GOING DOWN THERE RUN DOWN SLIDE DOWN OR FALL DOWN ANY WAY TO GET DOWN
BANG WENT A SHOT AND DOWN WENT MY HORSE MYSELF WITH HIM I DISENTANGLED MYSELF AND JUMPED BEHIND THE DEAD BODY LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE THE SHOT HAD COME I SAW TWO INDIANS AND AT ONCE TURNED MY GUN LOOSE ON THEM
SO RIDING DOWN INTO A SHELTERED PLACE IN THE BEND OF THE CREEK WE BUILT A FIRE AND BROILED SOME VENISON FROM A DEER WHICH WE HAD SHOT DURING THE DAY AND AFTER EATING A SUBSTANTIAL MEAL I LEFT THE FOUR MEN THERE WHILE I RETURNED TO BRING UP THE TROOPS
HAD SENT BACK A COMPANY OF THE SEVENTH CAVALRY TO FORT LYON FOR SUPPLIES BUT NO WORD HAD AS YET BEEN HEARD FROM THEM THE RATIONS WHICH MAJOR BROWN BROUGHT TO THE COMMAND CAME NONE TOO SOON AND WERE THE MEANS OF SAVING MANY LIVES
FOR HE HAD GREAT FEARS CONCERNING THE SAFETY OF GENERAL PENROSE THE COMMAND TOOK UP ITS MARCH NEXT DAY FOR THE CIMARRON AND HAD A HARD TRAMP OF IT ON ACCOUNT OF THE SNOW HAVING DRIFTED TO A GREAT DEPTH IN MANY OF THE RAVINES AND IN SOME PLACES THE TEAMSTERS HAD TO SHOVEL THEIR WAY THROUGH
AND ALSO FIRED AT THE ONES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM I WAS UNDECIDED AS TO WHETHER IT WAS BEST TO RUN BACK TO THE COMMAND ON FOOT OR HOLD MY POSITION I KNEW THAT WITHIN A FEW MINUTES THE TROOPS WOULD COME UP AND I THEREFORE DECIDED TO HOLD MY POSITION
BUT HOW TO GET THE WAGONS DOWN THERE IS A PUZZLER TO ME SAID HE BY THE TIME YOU ARE LOCATED IN YOUR CAMP YOUR WAGONS SHALL BE THERE SAID I ALL RIGHT CODY I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU AS YOU SEEM TO WANT TO BE BOSS HE REPLIED PLEASANTLY
AT NIGHT WE RETURNED TO THE COMMAND WHICH BY THIS TIME HAD CROSSED THE CREEK ON THE BEAVER DAM WE SCOUTED FOR SEVERAL DAYS ALONG THE RIVER AND HAD TWO OR THREE LIVELY SKIRMISHES FINALLY OUR SUPPLIES BEGAN TO RUN LOW AND GENERAL CARR GAVE ORDERS TO RETURN TO FORT WALLACE
HE CAME UP RATHER ANGRILY AND DEMANDED AN EXPLANATION I CAN'T ALLOW ANY SUCH BUSINESS AS THIS CODY SAID HE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IT I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ASKING FOR ANY WAGONS THIS TIME COLONEL SO I THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE THE BUFFALOES FURNISH THEIR OWN TRANSPORTATION
KILL YOUR BUFFALOES FIRST AND THEN I'LL SEND OUT THE WAGONS WAS THE COLONEL'S REPLY I SAID NO MORE BUT WENT OUT ON A HUNT AND AFTER A SHORT ABSENCE RETURNED AND ASKED THE COLONEL TO SEND OUT HIS WAGONS OVER THE HILL FOR THE HALF DOZEN BUFFALOES I HAD KILLED
WAS HOW WE WERE TO GET THE WAGONS DOWN WE WERE NOW IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE RATTOON MOUNTAINS AND THE BLUFF WE WERE ON WAS VERY STEEP CODY WE'RE IN A NICE FIX NOW SAID GENERAL CARR OH THAT'S NOTHING WAS MY REPLY
AND IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A HERD OF ELKS THAT HAD FRIGHTENED PAT AS HE HAD TURNED TO RUN HE HAD GONE UNDER A LIMB OF A TREE AGAINST WHICH HE HIT HIS HEAD
GENERAL SHERIDAN BEING ANXIOUS TO PUNISH THE INDIANS WHO HAD LATELY FOUGHT GENERAL FORSYTH DID NOT GIVE THE REGIMENT MUCH OF A REST AND ACCORDINGLY ON THE FIFTH OF OCTOBER IT BEGAN ITS MARCH FOR THE BEAVER CREEK COUNTRY THE FIRST NIGHT WE CAMPED ON THE SOUTH FORK OF BIG CREEK
BUT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT I MISSED MY AIM THEY FIRED TWO OR THREE MORE SHOTS AND I RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT WOUNDING ONE OF THEIR HORSES ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CREEK GOING OVER THE HILL I OBSERVED A FEW LODGES MOVING RAPIDLY AWAY
AND IN THE WAY YOU ARE BEARING IT WILL BE FIFTEEN MILES BEFORE YOU CAN STRIKE ANY OF THE BRANCHES OF THE BEAVER AND THAT WHEN YOU DO YOU WILL FIND NO WATER FOR THE BEAVERS ARE DRY AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR AT THAT POINT GENERAL I THINK THE SCOUTS ARE MISTAKEN SAID I
AND I PARTICULARLY REMEMBER TOM RENAHAN HANK FIELDS AND A CHARACTER CALLED NOSEY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LONG NOSE THE NEXT DAY WE MARCHED THIRTY MILES AND LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WE CAME INTO CAMP ON THE SOUTH FORK OF THE SOLOMON
GENERAL PENROSE HAD LEFT HIS POST THREE WEEKS PREVIOUSLY WITH A COMMAND OF SOME THREE HUNDRED MEN HE HAD TAKEN NO WAGONS WITH HIM AND HIS SUPPLY TRAIN WAS COMPOSED ONLY OF PACK MULES GENERAL CARR WAS ORDERED TO FOLLOW WITH SUPPLIES ON HIS TRAIL AND OVERTAKE HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
FOR THE BEAVER HAS MORE WATER NEAR ITS HEAD THAN IT HAS BELOW AND AT THE PLACE WHERE WE WILL STRIKE THE STREAM WE WILL FIND IMMENSE BEAVER DAMS LARGE ENOUGH AND STRONG ENOUGH TO CROSS THE WHOLE COMMAND IF YOU WISH WELL CODY GO AHEAD SAID HE I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU BUT REMEMBER THAT I DON'T WANT A DRY CAMP
A THREE DAYS UNINTERESTING MARCH BROUGHT US TO BEAVER CREEK WHERE WE WERE CAMPED AND FROM WHICH POINT SCOUTING PARTIES WERE SENT OUT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS NONE OF THESE HOWEVER DISCOVERING INDIANS THEY ALL RETURNED TO CAMP ABOUT THE SAME TIME
DAT'S DE BEST NEWS I'S HEERD FOAH SIXTEEN LONG DAYS MASSA BILL SAID HE WHERE'S YOUR COMMAND WHERE'S GENERAL PENROSE
HE BROUGHT WITH HIM THE CELEBRATED FORSYTH SCOUTS WHO WERE COMMANDED BY LIEUTENANT PEPOON A REGULAR ARMY OFFICER THE NEXT MORNING AT AN EARLY HOUR THE COMMAND STARTED OUT ON A HUNT FOR INDIANS
GOOD SAID OAKES NOW MISTER ELLIOTT WILL YOU KINDLY RETIRE WITH DOCTOR MOORE WHILE STONE MARTIN AND I HEAR WHAT THE CHIEF HAS TO SAY WHEN HALLEN CAME UP HE SEEMED VERY CORDIAL BUT WORRIED
AFTER A FEW HOURS HE WOKE UP AND WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND THAT THE PURSE WAS GONE
BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAN RIDING A CAMEL BLIND IN HIS RIGHT EYE LAME IN LEFT HIND FOOT AND CARRYING HONEY ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND CORN ON THE LEFT SIDE SO THE POLICE KNEW THAT HE WAS THE THIEF
THE PACKAGE ON THE RIGHT SIDE HAS HONEY IN IT AND THE PACKAGE ON THE LEFT SIDE HAS CORN IN IT SO YOU MUST SEARCH FOR A MAN WHO IS RIDING A CAMEL LOADED LIKE THAT HE IS THE THIEF
THREE OF THEM ARE QUITE DEEP AND CLEAR BUT THE FOURTH ONE IS VERY FAINT HE FOLLOWED THE CAMEL'S FOOTPRINTS ALONG THE ROAD FOR A LONG TIME
AND A MORE OR LESS GENERAL CONVERSATION HE RESUMED SUPPOSE CHIEF THAT WE NOW SMUGGLE THE NEGRO INTO MONA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND BRING HIM HERE I BELIEVE THAT IF MISTER ELLIOTT GOES BACK WITH MARTIN
AND MORE MUST BE DONE AT ONCE THAN I CAN DO WILL YOU HELP ME YES SAID OAKES OF COURSE HELLO WHAT AILS YOUR HEAD SAID THE CHIEF AFTER THANKING HIM
AND NOW MARTIN ASKING FOR ANOTHER WHAT IS MARTIN DOING UP HERE ASKED MOORE WELL DON'T GET IMPATIENT HE HAS SOMETHING IMPORTANT ANYWAY JUST WAIT
AND A FEW GRAINS OF THE CORN FELL TO THE GROUND FROM THE PACKAGE ON HIS LEFT SIDE BUT YOU COULD NOT SEE VERY WELL HERE AND THERE ON THE GROUND JUST A FEW DROPS OF HONEY OR
WERE IN SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS
HIM IN SELF PROTECTION I DON'T SEE WHY SAID MOORE HE COULD HAVE ESCAPED INSTEAD EXACTLY SAID OAKES HE COULD HAVE DONE SO BUT HE DID NOT WISH IT
AFTER FOLLOWING THE CAMEL'S FOOTPRINTS ON THE GROUND FOR A LONG TIME THE POLICE AT LAST CAME TO A VILLAGE THEY SEARCHED THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND FOUND MANY MEN RIDING CAMELS
THAT HAD PUT MOORE AND MYSELF IN A STATE OF EXTREME EXCITEMENT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE MARTIN AND MISTER ELLIOTT WERE WITH US OAKES RECEIVED ELLIOTT IN A MOST AGREEABLE MANNER
OAKES DID NOT NOTICE THE REMARK BUT SAID
IN HIS LEFT HIND FOOT
UNDOUBTEDLY AND HE RAN TO ESCAPE DETECTION HIMSELF THE OTHER
THE CLEVER MAN ANSWERED BUT I CAN TELL YOU ALL ABOUT THE CAMEL THE CAMEL IS BLIND IN HIS RIGHT EYE AND LAME IN HIS LEFT HIND FOOT
ABOUT A CAMEL AND A THIEF IT IS A TRUE STORY AND HAPPENED MANY MANY YEARS AGO
NEARLY EVERY STEP HE TOOK JERKED THE LOAD ON HIS BACK
BECAUSE HE MUST HAVE RIDDEN HIS CAMEL FROM THE ROADWAY RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE GRASS THE CLEVER MAN ANSWERED THEN HE MUST HAVE
THE WITNESS OAKES IN HIS FLUENT STYLE ACQUAINTED THE CHIEF WITH THE FACT THAT THE NEGRO WAS ALREADY UNDER SURVEILLANCE AND THAT IN HIS OPINION HE SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO MONA FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION YES
THAT WAS THE SIMPLEST OF ALL
AS THE MATTER BELONGS TO HIS JURISDICTION LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THAT MOMENT
AND MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DISGUISE THE FACT THAT HE ANTICIPATED TROUBLE WITH THE UNRULY ELEMENT IN MONA BY SATURDAY NIGHT YOU SEE HE SAID WE ARE FEW HERE
LIFE LONG FRIENDS ARE SUSPICIOUS OF ONE ANOTHER AND BUSINESS IS NEARLY AT A STANDSTILL
HE LAID PARTICULAR STRESS UPON THE FACT THAT OPINIONS SHOULD NEVER BE FORMED ON POOR EVIDENCE SINCE A BIASED MIND WAS INCAPABLE OF APPRECIATING NEW DISCOVERIES OR NEW CLUES
TO THEORIZE TOO MUCH WAS VERY EASY BUT SOMETIMES FATAL TO DETECTION OF CRIME HE PREFERRED TO WORK ALONG SEVERAL LINES OF INVESTIGATION BEFORE CONCENTRATION ON ANY ONE IDEA
IN THE HANDS OF A GOOD SHOT AS THE DISTANCE FROM WHICH IT WAS FIRED WOULD SEEM TO SHOW
CERTAINLY OAKES REPLIED IT IS MOST IMPORTANT DID WE NOT STUDY THE WORKINGS OF A CRIMINAL'S MIND FOR INSTANCE
THE MAN AT THE BRIDGE IS FRIENDLY BUT CANNOT EXPOSE HIS IDENTITY OR RISK CAPTURE THE WOULD BE ASSASSIN
HE HAS NOT COMPLETED WHAT HE WANTS TO DO AROUND HERE HE WISHED TO COME BACK AND TO DO SO WITH SAFETY HE MUST RID HIMSELF OF THE ONE WHO KNEW OF HIS DOINGS
IS ONE OF VERY GRAVE IMPORT UNQUESTIONABLY FROM WHAT YOU SAW STONE AND FROM THE EVIDENCE OF US ALL THERE WERE TWO MEN NEAR THE PLACE YOU WERE GOING TO PASS
BUT NOW AND AGAIN HE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT THE SHRUBS AND BUSHES WHICH GREW HERE AND THERE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD HELLO THAT IS STRANGE HE SUDDENLY SAID
YES SAID HALLEN AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS ONLY ONE QUINTUS OAKES IT SEEMS TO ME CONTINUED HALLEN
SAID OAKES AND HE CALLED IN MOORE AND ELLIOTT AND THE DISCUSSION BECAME GENERAL ELLIOTT WAS ADMITTED UNRESERVEDLY TO OUR COUNCILS ESPECIALLY AS OAKES KNEW THAT HE HELD THE KEYS TO THE CONVICTION OF THE ASSASSIN
THAT IS VERY CLEVER OF YOU THE JUDGE SAID
ALSO HE WAS SURE IT MUST BE OF GREAT VALUE SINCE THE GENTLEMAN HAD TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO PLACE HIM IN POSSESSION OF IT AND THIS WAS SAID BEFORE ANY INFORMATION WAS GIVEN
THE CLEVER MAN ANSWERED VERY MODESTLY FIRST ABOUT THE CAMEL BEING BLIND IN HIS RIGHT EYE HE HAD NIBBLED AT THE SHRUBS AND BUSHES GROWING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD
THAT SHOWED THAT THE CAMEL WAS LIMPING AND THE LEFT HIND FOOT ONLY JUST TOUCHED THE GROUND SO I KNEW THAT HE WAS LAME IN THAT FOOT THAT IS ALSO VERY CLEVER OF YOU THE JUDGE SAID
AND HERE ARE A LOT OF ANTS SCRAMBLING OVER THE GROUND ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD
AND THE OTHER RETALIATED WITH A BLOW AND AN OATH AND ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LOOK AT HIS OWN ARMS NOT HIS NEIGHBOR'S YES SAID OAKES
AND THEN OAKES TOLD HIM AS MUCH AS WAS NECESSARY OF THE EVENTS OF THE DAY BEFORE I AM VERY GLAD YOUR CARPENTERS HAVE ARRIVED SAID THE CHIEF THEY MAY HELP HE SMILED AS DID OAKES THEY UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER THEY
WE SAW THAT OUR FRIEND WAS A DIPLOMAT QUICKLY MISTER ELLIOTT GAVE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE NEGRO'S CONFESSION AND THE DETECTIVE SAID
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD I FOUND A SWARM OF BEES HERE AND THERE SO I KNEW THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO PICK UP THE HONEY AND ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD I SAW A WHOLE LOT OF ANTS HERE AND THERE
AND THE POLICE BROUGHT HIM WITH THEM TO THE PLACE WHERE THE MONEY HAD BEEN STOLEN THE CLEVER MAN LOOKED ALL AROUND THE PLACE VERY CAREFULLY TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND ANY MARKS ON THE GROUND
SO THE POLICE SEARCHED FOR A MAN WHO WAS RIDING A CAMEL WHICH WAS BLIND IN HIS RIGHT EYE LAME IN HIS LEFT HIND FOOT AND CARRYING HONEY IN A PACKAGE ON HIS RIGHT SIDE AND CORN IN A PACKAGE ON HIS LEFT SIDE
ON THE GRASS NEAR THE TREE HE FOUND NO MARKS IN FACT IF A PERSON WALKS ON THE GRASS JUST ONCE OR TWICE IT DOES NOT LEAVE ANY MARK
I MYSELF HAD FREQUENTLY HAD CAUSE TO STUDY SUCH MENTAL PROCESSES IN THE PRACTICE OF MY PROFESSION BUT I WAS AMAZED AT THE KNOWLEDGE SHOWN BY OAKES
BUT AS THE CAMEL COULD NOT STEAL THE MONEY THERE MUST BE A MAN RIDING ON THE CAMEL HE MUST BE THE THIEF BUT WHY DIDN'T THE THIEF LEAVE ANY FOOTPRINTS
IT MUST BE IMPRESSED UPON HIM THAT HE IS REGARDED IN THE LIGHT OF A HERO APPEAL TO THE INNATE WEAKNESS OF THE RACE DESIRE FOR FLATTERY
HE FOUND FOOTPRINTS THEY ARE A CAMEL'S FOOTPRINTS HE SAID LOOKING AT THE MARKS CAREFULLY
JUMPED DOWN UPON THE GRASS WHERE HE KNEW HE WOULD NOT LEAVE ANY FOOTPRINT HE MUST HAVE WALKED VERY QUIETLY ON THE GRASS UP TO THE TREE WHERE THE TRAVELER WAS SLEEPING AND STOLEN THE MONEY
MY MEN HAVE REPORTED TO ME THE CURIOUS AFFAIR OF LAST NIGHT CONTINUED THE CHIEF I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR IT IN ANY EVENT IT MUST BE FOLLOWED UP THE PEOPLE MUST BE DIVERTED
AS ANY CARPENTER OR MASON MIGHT DO LOOKS AS THOUGH I AM GOING TO HOLD A RECEPTION THIS MORNING SAID OAKES
SOMEBODY HAD QUIETLY STOLEN HIS PURSE AND GONE AWAY THE TRAVELER RAN TO THE NEAREST VILLAGE AND THERE TOLD THE POLICE ABOUT IT NOW AMONG THE POLICE THERE WAS A VERY CLEVER MAN
AND TOOK HIM BEFORE THE JUDGE THEN THE THIEF SAID THAT IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT HE STOLE THE MONEY AFTERWARDS THE JUDGE TURNED TO THE CLEVER MAN AND ASKED HIM
OF THE CRIMINAL'S REASONING A MOTIVE BUILT UP OF SOMETHING UNREAL A DELUSION IN THE MIND OF ONE NOT IN HIS RIGHT SENSES
THE TENSION IS GREAT TOO GREAT FOR SAFETY
I THINK MOORE FELT AGGRAVATED AT OAKES'S APPARENT INDIFFERENCE OF COURSE IT WAS SIMULATED BUT HE SEEMED SO CALM AND OBLIVIOUS OF THE MASS OF HAPPENINGS
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD THERE WERE ALSO PLENTY OF GOOD SHRUBS AND BUSHES BUT THE CAMEL HAD NOT TAKEN A SINGLE BITE AT ANY OF THEM THAT SHOWED THAT HE DID NOT EVEN SEE THOSE SHRUBS AND BUSHES ON HIS RIGHT SIDE
MIGHT BE CONNECTED WITH THE MURDER INDIRECTLY OR DIRECTLY BUT AS YET WE HAD NOT HAD SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDYING THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE HOUSE OR THE LIFE OF ITS ATTACHES TO VENTURE AN OPINION
AND STATED IN SUCH A BROAD UNTECHNICAL MANNER THE MAN WAS NO ORDINARY ONE TO BE SURE BUT I HAD SCARCELY EXPECTED HIM TO SHOW SUCH EDUCATION IN THESE MATTERS I NOW RECALLED WHAT MOORE
ONE MUST ALWAYS TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE ACTIONS AND REASONINGS OF COMMUNITIES EMOTIONAL WAVES RUSH THROUGH THEM AS THROUGH INDIVIDUALS SOMETIMES
I SHALL MAKE TIME HALLEN TO DO WHAT LITTLE I CAN AND THUS QUINTUS OAKES BECAME THE LEADER IN THE UNRAVELLING OF THE MARK MURDER MYSTERY AFTER A FEW REMARKS OF NO PARTICULAR CONSEQUENCE
THEY MIGHT INFER HE WAS THE MURDERER AND VIOLENCE WOULD CERTAINLY BE DONE HIM AT PRESENT I HAVE ALL I CAN DO TO KEEP ORDER IN THE TOWN SAID HALLEN THEN HE GAVE A LUCID ACCOUNT OF THE WAVE OF SUSPICION AND OF THE EVIDENCES
WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE THIEF WHO STOLE THE MONEY YOU HAVE NOT FOUND ANY OTHER FOOTPRINTS EXCEPT THE CAMEL'S THAT IS QUITE TRUE THE CLEVER MAN SAID
I COULD NOT THE CLEVER MAN ANSWERED
I VENTURED OR BOTH SAID OAKES AT ALL EVENTS SAID HALLEN
ONE THAT WOULD NATURALLY SWAY AN ORDINARY HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL UNDER THE CONDITIONS APPERTAINING TO THE CRIME THE SO CALLED SANE MOTIVE OR WAS IT IN ANY WAY DEPENDENT UPON PECULIARITIES
ONCE UPON A TIME A TRAVELER WAS GOING ON FOOT ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN HIS BELT HE HAD A PURSE FULL OF MONEY ONE DAY AS THE SUN BEGAN TO GET HOT HE LAY DOWN ON THE GRASS UNDER A TREE NEAR THE ROADWAY AND FELL ASLEEP
HOW CAN WE FIND HIM IF YOU DO NOT TELL US WHAT HE IS LIKE I CANNOT TELL YOU A THING ABOUT THE THIEF
INCOGNITO LEST THE PEOPLE BECOME TOO EXCITED
THE CAMEL HAS EATEN FROM THE BUSHES AND SHRUBS HERE AND THERE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD BUT HE HASN'T EATEN AT ALL FROM THOSE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD HE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME LONGER
WOULD UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE RUN AWAY WHEN HE SAW YOU WERE WARNED HE DID RUN BUT IT WAS AFTER THE MAN WHO WARNED YOU TO MY MIND THE EXPLANATION IS THIS CONTINUED THE DETECTIVE
HAD ONCE TOLD ME OF OAKES'S ALL ROUND ATTAINMENTS DOCTOR MOORE BROKE THE SILENCE
LOOK AT HISTORY AND CONSIDER THE WAVES OF RELIGION EMOTIONAL IN CHARACTER THAT HAVE OCCURRED LOOK AT THE UNREASONABLENESS DEVELOPED IN OUR OWN COUNTRY FROM IGNORANCE AND FEAR
THEN SUDDENLY STOPPED TO LOOK AT THE ROAD WHERE THE CAMEL HAD WALKED HELLO THIS IS ALSO STRANGE HE SAID HERE ARE A LOT OF BEES BUZZING NEAR THE GROUND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD
SO I KNEW THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO PICK UP AND CARRY AWAY THE GRAINS OF CORN NOW WAS IT NOT REALLY CLEVER OF THAT MAN TO FIND ALL THAT OUT ABOUT THE CAMEL WITHOUT EVER SEEING THE CAMEL BEFORE
BUT AS YOU UNDERSTAND
I BELIEVE WE CAN BRING HIM HERE EASILY SAID ELLIOTT FOR HE HAS CONFIDENCE IN ME IF HE REFUSES TO COME SAID HALLEN WE CAN GET HIM HERE IN PLENTY OF WAYS YES SAID OAKES
YOU SEE THE DETERMINATION OF THE PROBABLE CONDITION OF SUCH A ONE'S MIND IS OFTEN PARAMOUNT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH A CASE AS THIS IN OTHER WORDS WAS THE MOTIVE
AND I HAVE BEEN KEPT BUSY WITH THE BREWING UNEASINESS IN TOWN AND CANNOT HANDLE THE MURDER AFFAIR SATISFACTORILY I HAVE COME TO ASK YOU TO HELP ME IF YOU ARE SUFFICIENTLY AT LEISURE WE CANNOT GET ANY CLUES AT ALL
THAT THE FIRST ONE WARNED YOU AND WAS IN A SENSE A FRIEND IS MYSTERIOUS ENOUGH IT NEEDS SOLUTION BUT THAT THE MAN WHO WARNED YOU SHOULD HAVE RUN AWAY AND BEEN PURSUED BY THE OTHER IS PECULIAR TO SAY THE LEAST
AS THE CAMEL WALKED ALONG THE MARKS OF HIS TWO FRONT FEET AND RIGHT HIND FOOT WERE QUITE DEEP AND CLEAR ON THE GROUND BUT THE MARK OF HIS LEFT HIND FOOT WAS VERY FAINT
AT THE STAKE OAKES SAID MOORE WITH A SMILE YOU SEEM TO MAKE MENTAL PROCESSES AND CONDITIONS
AND I TRUST THAT YOU WILL FIND TIME TO CONSIDER THE MURDER ALSO GENTLEMEN SAID OAKES VERY SERIOUSLY
THE WISHES OF A DISTINGUISHED AND BRILLIANT ASSEMBLY BEGIN BY PUTTING DOWN UPON PAPER A HASTY SKETCH OF A SHORT PIECE AS FOR INSTANCE A VAUDEVILLE OR A LITTLE COMEDY YOU WILL DO THIS UNTIL BEING SURE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU WOULD EMBRACE THE ENSEMBLE
FOR SUCH INQUIRIES PRESUPPOSE SOME DEGREE OF INTIMACY IN THE LAST CASE THERE IS A METHOD OF MANIFESTING OUR INTEREST WITHOUT VIOLATING ETIQUETTE IT CONSISTS IN MAKING THESE INQUIRIES OF THE DOMESTICS OR OF OTHER PERSONS OF THE HOUSE
IF YOU HAD BEEN THIS BAD PERSON OR SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAD COMMITTED THIS BASE ACT OR
YOUR PARTIALITY BLINDS YOU PERSONS WHO ARE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE WORLD COMMONLY THINK THAT THEY CANNOT ADDRESS A LADY WITHOUT FIRST ASSAILING HER WITH COMPLIMENTS THIS IS A MISTAKE GENTLEMEN AND I CAN WITH RELATION TO THIS POINT
REQUEST HIM TO CONTINUE AT THE SAME TIME SAYING I LISTEN TO YOU ALWAYS WITH NEW PLEASURE THIS DELICATE POLITENESS IS PARTICULARLY TO BE OBSERVED TOWARDS OLD PERSONS WHEN YOUR NARRATIONS HAVE HAD SUCCESS KEEP A MODEST COUNTENANCE
AFTER HAVING PRETENDED TO TAKE IT BEWARE OF PRESENTING TO LADIES IN BALLS OR ASSEMBLIES A BOX OF SWEET THINGS UNDER PENALTY OF HAVING THE AIR OF A CARICATURE
OF DISCUSSIONS AND QUOTATIONS WHATEVER BE THE SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION PROPOSE YOUR OPINION WITH MODESTY
IT REQUIRES BUT A MOMENT TO LOSE THOSE DELICATE SHADES OF CHARACTER WHICH CONSTITUTE A MAN OF THE WORLD
THUS SAYS SHE THOSE WHO EXCEED THE TRUTH ARE IN THE HABIT OF SAYING YOU MAY RELY UPON IT IT IS THE TRUTH LONG TALKERS SAY IN A WORD TO BE BRIEF AND THE PROUD SAY
MOST FREQUENTLY IT IS INVOLUNTARY OFTEN IN A LIVELY AND ANIMATED DIALOGUE THE IMPETUS OF CONVERSATION CARRIES YOU AS WELL AS THE PERSON WITH WHOM YOU ARE CONVERSING FAR FROM THE POINT FROM WHICH YOU STARTED
OF QUESTIONS AND FREQUENTLY RECURRING EXPRESSIONS IT IS AN AXIOM OF PROPRIETY THAT WE SHOULD NEVER SPEAK OF OURSELVES EXCEPT TO INTIMATE FRIENDS AND THAT WE SHOULD CONVERSE WITH STRANGERS ABOUT THEMSELVES AND EVERYTHING WHICH CAN INTEREST THEM
THESE INSIPIDITIES MAY INDEED PLEASE SOME OF LIGHT AND FRIVOLOUS MINDS BUT WILL DISGUST A WOMAN OF GOOD SENSE CARRY ON WITH THEM A LIVELY PIQUANT AND VARIED CONVERSATION AND REMEMBER THAT THEY HAVE A TOO ACTIVE IMAGINATION
IF THE PERSON ADDRESSED HAS A TITLE OR THAT WHICH HE HAS FROM HIS PROFESSION WE SHOULD GIVE IT HIM AS COUNT DOCTOR
IF YOU STRIKE AGAINST ANY ONE IN THE LEAST ASK PARDON FOR IT IMMEDIATELY THE OTHER SHOULD AT THE SAME TIME ANSWER YOU
LEARNED AS THE MUSES
THE RULES OF POLITENESS IN THIS RESPECT ARE THE SAME IN SPEAKING OF THE HUSBAND WHEN WE SPEAK OF OURSELF AND ANOTHER PERSON WHETHER HE IS ABSENT OR PRESENT PROPRIETY REQUIRES US TO MENTION OURSELVES LAST THUS WE SHOULD SAY
TO LOAD HIM WITH EXAGGERATED EULOGIUMS IT IS INDEED NOT A LITTLE EMBARRASSING TO REPLY IN SUCH A CASE IF WE REMAIN SILENT WE APPEAR TO BE INHALING THE INCENSE WITH COMPLACENCY
A LADY WILL NOT SAY MY HUSBAND EXCEPT AMONG INTIMATES IN EVERY OTHER CASE SHE SHOULD ADDRESS HIM BY HIS NAME CALLING HIM MISTER IT IS EQUALLY GOOD TON THAT EXCEPT ON OCCASIONS OF CEREMONY AND WHILE SHE IS QUITE YOUNG TO DESIGNATE HIM
EXTRAVAGANT AND MISPLACED EULOGIUMS NEITHER HONOR THE ONE WHO BESTOWS THEM NOR THE PERSONS WHO RECEIVE THEM AN INFALLIBLE METHOD OF GIVING A MERITORIOUS PERSON THE AIR OF A FOOL IS TO ADDRESS HIM TO HIS FACE AND WITHOUT DISGUISE
THEY ARE ALSO MISPLACED WHENEVER BEING SATISFIED WITH AVOIDING DISAGREEABLE COMPARISONS WE ENDEAVOR TO MARK OUT SOME ONE AS CONTEMPTIBLE BY COMPARING HIS EXTERIOR WITH THAT OF SOME OTHER PERSON IN THE COMPANY WHEN WE SAY
NAMELY THOSE WHICH OFFEND MODESTY PROPRIETY ALLOWS YOU AND IT EVEN REQUIRES YOU NOT TO LISTEN TO BUT EVEN TO INTERRUPT AN ILL BRED PERSON
AND INSTEAD OF THE PLURAL FORM WE RESOLVED WE DID SUCH A THING YOU SHOULD FORGET YOURSELF AND SAY MISTER N RESOLVED OR DID SUCH A THING SO AND SO DELICACY WILL DICTATE THIS DEGREE OF MODESTY TO YOU
REVEAL TO YOU WHAT MY SEX PREFERS TO THESE VULGAR EULOGIUMS IT IS IN BAD TON TO OVERWHELM WITH INSIPID FLATTERY ALL WOMEN THAT WE MEET WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF AGE RANK OR MERIT
YOU WILL HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN WITH HIM BE ASSURED THAT THE SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION CAN BE CONQUERED ONLY BY SILENCE THE INSUPPORTABLE PEDANTRY OF A CLOUD OF QUOTERS WITHOUT TACT OR TALENT HAS JUSTLY FOR A LONG TIME
AND COMPARISONS THE TWO SHOALS TO BE AVOIDED IN THIS FORM OF LANGUAGE ARE DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER THE ONE IS TRIVIALITY THE OTHER BOMBAST THE OBJECT OF SUPPOSITION WHICH IS ALREADY ANTIQUATED AND SOMETIMES TOO SIMPLE
THERE ARE MANY CONDITIONS INDISPENSABLE TO THE SUCCESS OF A NARRATIVE THESE CONDITIONS ARE FIRST NOVELTY THE BEST STORIES WEARY WHEN THEY ARE MULTIPLIED TOO MUCH BECAUSE EVERY ONE WISHES TO BE AN ACTOR IN HIS TURN UPON THE STAGE OF THE WORLD
EULOGIUMS ARE AND WILL FOR A LONG TIME BE A MEANS OF SUCCESS BUT THEY SHOULD BE IN THE FIRST PLACE TRUE OR AT LEAST PROBABLE
WHEN IT IS NOT A MERE WORK OF LOQUACITY MAY BE EMPLOYED IN SERIOUS DISCOURSE AS POLITICAL PHILOSOPHICAL OR MORAL DISCUSSIONS BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO TREAT IT WITH INFINITE RESERVE AND CARE AND NEVER TO INTRODUCE A PERSONAL APOLOGY
TURN AWAY THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO LISTEN TO US AND RENDER US IMPORTUNATE AND RIDICULOUS WITHOUT OUR BEING ABLE TO PERCEIVE IT IF HABITUAL TERMS WHICH ON NO OTHER ACCOUNT ARE REPREHENSIBLE CAN BECOME SO TROUBLESOME
IF PERCEIVING THAT YOU ARE EMBARRASSED AND THAT YOU ENDEAVOR TO SAVE YOURSELF BY AN EVASIVE ANSWER INSTEAD OF KEEPING SILENCE YOU WITNESS THE FOOLISH REGRETS OF YOUR INDISCRETION BE ASSURED THAT BOTH YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOURSELF
NEVER REFUSE WITH DISDAIN A PINCH OF SNUFF
AND OF SAYING AFTERWARDS WHEN INTRODUCED I AM HAPPY SIR TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE IN GOOD HEALTH CUSTOM FORBIDS A LADY TO MAKE THESE INQUIRIES OF A GENTLEMAN UNLESS HE IS ILL OR VERY AGED TO PUT A CORRECTIVE UPON THIS MARK OF REGARD
DOUBTFUL WHETHER TO FAVOR YOUR ADVERSARY OR YOURSELF POLITENESS IS NOT LESS OPPOSED TO MAKING EXCESSIVE COMPLAINTS TO THE FIRST PERSON YOU MEET THAN TO THE FREQUENT AND EXTRAVAGANT EULOGIUMS WHICH YOU
AND IF HE HAPPENS TO IMPART TO YOU WHAT HE RELATED THE PRECEDING DAY WHICH HE HAD FROM YOU YOURSELF YOU SHOULD APPEAR TO LISTEN WITH EQUAL INTEREST AS IF FOR THE FIRST TIME FREQUENTLY IN THE MIDST OF A RECITAL
AS TO HOAXING THAT CAUSTIC OF FOOLS AS TO THAT SILLY GAIETY EXCITED BY THE CANDOR OR POLITENESS OF PEOPLE WHOM YOU FALSELY CAUSE TO BELIEVE THE MOST FOOLISH THINGS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MAKE KNOWN TO YOU THAT THEY SEE THROUGH THIS
BY A QUICK AND PENETRATING PERCEPTION BY A LOVE OF THE FINE ARTS AND BY A PECULIAR READINESS FIND THEMSELVES ABLE TO SPEAK PROPERLY OF LITERARY PRODUCTIONS THOSE WHO ARE LESS ENGAGED IN THESE THINGS SHOULD CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH
WE WILL MENTION SOME EXAMPLES OF THESE PARTICULAR VIOLATIONS OF POLITENESS TO ACCOST SAD PEOPLE WITH A SMILING FACE AND SPRIGHTLY MANNERS WHICH PROVE TO THEM THE LITTLE INTEREST WHICH YOU TAKE IN THEIR SITUATION
BESTOW IMPROPERLY UPON THOSE FROM WHOM YOU EXPECT A FAVOR IN RETURN BY THE WORD IMPROPRIETIES WE GENERALLY UNDERSTAND ALL VIOLATIONS OF POLITENESS WE HOWEVER GIVE TO THIS WORD
IF IT IS A QUESTION OF PLEASURE OR INTEREST RETURN TO YOUR POINT BY EMPLOYING A POLITE TURN AS PRAY LET US NOT LOSE SIGHT OF OUR BUSINESS BUT IF IT IS AN AFFAIR OF NOTHINGS SUCCEEDING NOTHINGS LET IT FLOW ON VOLUNTARY DIGRESSION
WHEN BOTH THESE QUALITIES ARE REGULATED BY REASON USE AND TASTE IT IS VERY WELL BUT HOW SELDOM IS THIS THE CASE THEY ARE NOT SO USED IF IN THE COURSE OF A DISCUSSION
AS EVERY HEARER IS OBLIGED TO LISTEN OR UNDERSTAND WITHOUT OBJECTING THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WE SHOULD FEEL OUR GROUND BEFORE SPEAKING
BUT IT WOULD BE WEARISOME TO THEM TO MAKE A LONG ENUMERATION OF THE MEMBERS WHO COMPOSE THE FAMILY WE CAN PUT A GENERAL QUESTION DESIGNATING THE MOST IMPORTANT MEMBERS IN CASE OF THE ABSENCE OF NEAR RELATIONS WE ASK THE PERSON WE ARE VISITING IF THEY HAVE HEARD FROM THEM LATELY
SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE ANYTHING EXCELLENT TO RELATE CONSULT LESS YOUR OWN DESIRE TO TELL IT THAN THE WISHES OF OTHERS TO HEAR YOU THERE ARE BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF WEARYING WHILE TELLING VERY GOOD THINGS
OUGHT TO OBSERVE IT WHEREVER HE IS WE MIGHT QUOTE MORE THAN ONE EXAMPLE OF PERSONS WHO HAVE LOST POLITENESS OF MANNERS AND OF LANGUAGE BY ASSUMING THE HABITS AND CONVERSATION OF ALL KINDS OF SOCIETY INTO WHICH CHANCE MAY HAVE CARRIED THEM
HE AND I YOU AND I WHEN YOU RELATE A PERSONAL OCCURRENCE THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH WHICH ARE HONORABLE TO YOURSELF AND A DISTINGUISHED PERSON HAD ALSO A SHARE IN THE HONOR
A TOO GREAT VERSATILITY OF DISPOSITION TO SUPPORT CONVERSATION FOR A LONG TIME UPON THE SAME SUBJECT BUT IS IT THEN NECESSARY TO PROSCRIBE EULOGIUMS ENTIRELY NOT AT ALL SOCIETY HAS NOT YET ARRIVED AT THAT DEGREE OF PHILOSOPHY
ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR TOO GREAT EAGERNESS TO TELL THEM THE NEXT THING IS TO TAKE A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY LET YOUR NARRATION SPRING NATURALLY FROM THE CONVERSATION LET IT EXPLAIN A FACT OR COME IN SUPPORT OF AN OPINION
A LADY WHO ADDRESSES A GENTLEMAN SHOULD BE EARNEST IN HER INQUIRIES OF THE HEALTH OF HIS FAMILY HOWEVER LITTLE INTIMACY SHE MAY HAVE WITH THEM MANY PERSONS ASK THIS QUESTION MECHANICALLY WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE ANSWER
IF SOCIETY IS NOT A SCHOOL FOR EXERCISING PEDANTRY NEITHER IS IT AN ARENA FOR THE USE OF THOSE PERVERSELY CLEVER PEOPLE WHO THINK THEMSELVES FURNISHED WITH A PATENT TO INSULT WITH GRACE WHATEVER MAY BE THE KEENNESS OF THEIR SARCASMS
BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF THIS MOTIVE IT IS NECESSARY FOR US CAREFULLY TO AVOID FREQUENTLY RECURRING WORDS AS IN TIME HABIT MULTIPLIES THEM TO AN INCONCEIVABLE DEGREE THEY EMBARRASS AND OVERWHELM OUR CONVERSATION
OF THE RIGHT OR MEANS OF COMPLAINING WHO ARE READY TO CATCH AT THE LEAST ERROR TO EXAGGERATE IT TO CLOTHE IT IN THE MOST BITTER LANGUAGE TO PRESENT IT IN THE MOST RIDICULOUS LIGHT WHO MEANLY ATTACK THOSE WHO CANNOT ANSWER THEM
THEY WILL EITHER PREVENT THE SPEAKER FROM BEING UNDERSTOOD OR THEY WILL GIVE HIM THE AIR OF SANCHO PANZA BUT THE PREVIOUS REMARK HOWEVER NEED BE BUT SHORT AS THE PROVERB SAYS AS THE WISDOM OF NATIONS HAS IT
TO TROUBLE BY A WHIMSICAL AND CROSS ILL HUMOR AND BY MISANTHROPIC DECLAMATIONS THE PLEASURE OF CONTENTED PERSONS TO EXALT THE ADVANTAGES OF BEAUTY BEFORE AGED LADIES
WILL BE CONSIDERED AS A TORMENT MADAME NECKER INGENIOUSLY OBSERVES THAT THESE FAVORITE AND FREQUENTLY REPEATED TERMS WITH WHICH WE FILL OUR CONVERSATION SERVE ORDINARILY AS A MARK OF PEOPLE'S CHARACTER
MOREOVER IF LOVE OF TRUTH OR THE DESIRE OF AFFORDING INSTRUCTION FORCE YOU TO ENTER INTO A DISCUSSION DO IT WITH ADDRESS AND POLITENESS IF YOU DO NOT BRING OVER YOUR OPPONENT TO YOUR OWN OPINION YOU WILL AT LEAST GAIN HIS ESTEEM
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COMPLAINING HAS ALWAYS A BAD GRACE BANISH FROM YOUR COMPLAINTS ILL NATURE AND ANIMOSITY
IT IS INCIVILITY WITH AFFECTATION
AND YOUR SUPERIOR IN HIS TURN WILL PROCLAIM AT HIS OWN EXPENSE YOUR MERIT ON THE OCCASION WE KNOW THAT THE WORD FALSE IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE DICTIONARY OF POLITENESS AND THAT WHEN WE ARE OBLIGED TO DENY THE ASSERTION OF ANY ONE WE EMPLOY
A SLIGHT INDISPOSITION TO PERSONS WHO ARE STRANGERS TO US BECAUSE THEIR INTEREST CAN BE ONLY FORMAL AFTER WE ARE INFORMED OF THE HEALTH OF THE PERSON WE ARE VISITING IT IS PROPER TO INQUIRE OF THEM IN RELATION TO THE HEALTH OF THEIR FAMILIES
SIMPLY AND BRIEFLY EXPLAINING A SUBJECT AND OF MENTIONING THE EMOTION THEY FELT WITH SPEAKING OF SOME BRILLIANT PASSAGE AND ADDING THAT THEY DO NOT PRETEND TO PRONOUNCE JUDGMENT THE FIRST DEGREE OF DIGRESSION IS THE PARENTHESIS PROVIDED IT IS SHORT
OR EXPOSE THEMSELVES EVERY DAY FOR A SARCASM TO SPORT WITH THEIR OWN LIFE AND THAT OF ANOTHER IN A DUEL SUCH PEOPLE WHAT ARE THEY IN TRUTH I DARE NOT SAY ONE SUCH PICTURE WHICH CERTAINLY IS NOT HIGHLY COLORED
WHO IMPORTUNES YOU WITH THOSE INDECENT WITTICISMS WHICH A MAN OF GOOD SOCIETY OUGHT ALWAYS TO AVOID THEY ARE THOSE BY AID OF WHICH WE COVER CERTAIN PLEASANTRIES WITH A VEIL SO TRANSPARENT THAT THEY ARE THE MORE OBSERVED
QUESTIONS ARE THEREFORE NECESSARY BUT THEY DEMAND INFINITE DELICACY AND TACT IN ORDER NEITHER TO FATIGUE NOR EVER WOUND THE FEELINGS IF INSTEAD OF EXPRESSING A MILD AND HEARTFELT INTEREST
WHICH ARE HAPPY IN EVERY RESPECT NOR THAT WE OUGHT TO DEPRECATE THIS KIND OF PLEASANTRY BEFORE PEOPLE WHO ARE FOND OF THEM STILL LESS TO TELL THEM WHAT THEY HEAR EVERY DAY THAT IS POOR
WOULD RENDER PLEASANTRIES ALWAYS ODIOUS BUT TO INDULGE IN PLEASANTRY IS NOT TO RESEMBLE SUCH MISCHIEVOUS PERSONS THANK HEAVEN IT IS FAR OTHERWISE FOR MILD KIND AND HARMLESS PLEASANTRY SHOULD BE TAKEN IN GOOD PART
A PARTICULAR AND LIMITED SENSE IT SIGNIFIES A WANT OF DUE REGARD TO AND A FORGETFULNESS OF THE DELICATE ATTENTIONS WHICH SEEM TO IDENTIFY US WITH THE SITUATION OF OTHERS
BUT IF YOU HAVE TO DO WITH ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO POSSESSED WITH A MANIA OF DISCUSSION COMMENCE BY CONTRADICTING BEFORE THEY HEAR AND WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO SUSTAIN THE CONTRARY OPINION YIELD TO HIM
YOU SUPPOSE A RESPECTABLE PERSON TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF A MADMAN AN ILL BRED PERSON OR A ROBBER OR IF YOU SUPPOSE HIM TO BE IN A SITUATION DISGRACEFUL OR EVEN RIDICULOUS AS FOR EXAMPLE
THOSE COMMON BUT AGREEABLE AND WELL SETTLED EXPRESSIONS THOSE GENERAL OR PARTICULAR ALLUSIONS WHICH ARE ONLY TO BE USED WITH A PECULIAR EMPHASIS WHICH IS TO LANGUAGE WHAT THE ITALIC CHARACTER IS TO PRINTING
ALAS THEY ONLY ADD TO THEIR OWN DEFEAT AND TO THE ENNUI OF THEIR POOR HEARERS IF ONE RELATES AN ANECDOTE WHICH YOU ALREADY KNOW PERMIT HIM TO FINISH IT AND DO NOT IN ANY WAY DRAW OFF THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO ARE LISTENING IF YOUR OPINION IS ASKED
WHAT RESULTS MAY THESE TRITE PHRASES TRIVIAL EXPRESSIONS AND VULGAR TRANSITIONS PRODUCE WHEN THEY BECOME FREQUENT SECTION THREE OF NARRATIONS ANALYSIS AND DIGRESSIONS
IS TO INCREASE THE FORCE OF REASONING AND TO CARRY CONVICTION TO THE MIND OF THE PERSON WHO LISTENS TO YOU
APOLOGETICAL FORMS THE MOST PROPER ONES ARE SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING I MAY BE MISTAKEN I AM UNDOUBTEDLY MISTAKEN BUT BE SO GOOD AS TO EXCUSE MY MISTAKE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME I ASK PARDON BUT I THOUGHT
OR BY A NOT LESS FOOLISH DESIRE OF MAKING A DISPLAY OF TALENT REMEMBER THAT THE MOST MEAGRE RECITALS WHEN THEY ARE APROPOS FREQUENTLY PLEASE MORE THAN THE BEST THINGS IN THE WORLD WHEN THEY ARE SAID OUT OF TIME
THE NARRATOR THROUGH FORGETFULNESS HESITATES AND THINKS THAT HE CAN RECALL IT LOOK AT HIM ATTENTIVELY IF HE IS IN DOUBT DECLARE THAT YOU ARE ALTOGETHER IGNORANT OF THE SUBJECT IN QUESTION IF HIS MEMORY RETURNS
IF THE NEWS IS FAVORABLE THEY ON THEIR PART ASK THE SAME OF US WHEN YOU ARE NOT ON VISITS OF GREAT CEREMONY AT THE TIME OF TAKING LEAVE YOU ARE COMMONLY DESIRED TO GIVE THE COMPLIMENTS AND SALUTATIONS OF THE PERSONS YOU ARE VISITING TO THOSE WITH WHOM YOU LIVE
PLEASURE OF STUPID FELLOWS I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY OF THEM EXCEPT THAT I HAVE TOO GOOD AN OPINION OF MY READER TO SUPPOSE THAT HE DOES NOT DESPISE THEM AS I DO POPULAR QUOTATIONS AND PROVERBS AS WELL AS OTHER QUOTATIONS REQUIRE SOME CARE
THIS CANNOT BE TOLERATED IT IS TO BE SUPPOSED THAT THE PERSON WHO PRAISES YOU IS INCAPABLE OF SUCH AN ACT I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SAY I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE SO KIND OR SO GOOD I SHOULD INDEED THINK YOU WERE JOKING ME OR ELSE WE SHOULD SAY
AS QUACKISH AS A DOCTOR GREEDY AS AN ATTORNEY
A PROVERB WELL APPLIED AND PLACED AT THE END OF A PHRASE FREQUENTLY MAKES A VERY HAPPY CONCLUSION I ONLY SPEAK TO CENSURE I ENTREAT MY READERS NOT TO SUFFER THEMSELVES TO BE THE MANUFACTURERS OF PUNS
ALL THESE QUALITIES WHICH BELONG TO POLITENESS ARE INCLUDED IN THESE EXPRESSIVE WORDS GOODNESS MODERATION DECORUM
OR TO PRETEND TO RECOGNIZE IN THE PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG LADY THE LIKENESS OF AN ELDERLY LADY OR OF ONE LESS FAVORED BY NATURE IT WOULD MOREOVER BE IMPROPER TO MAKE LONG COMPLIMENTS INDIRECT AND INGENIOUS PRAISE IS ALL THAT IS PROPER SECTION TWO
OR A DOMESTIC INCIDENT ALTOGETHER OUT OF PLACE AS THOSE PERSONS DO WHO IN NARRATING ANY EVENT RELATIVE TO AN INDIVIDUAL RECOUNT HIS LIFE THEIR CONNEXION WITH HIM OR HIS WHOLE FAMILY AND MAKE THE EVENT OF AN HOUR REMIND US OF AGES
GIVE IT FRANKLY AND WITHOUT WISHING TO APPEAR BETTER INFORMED THAN THE NARRATOR HIMSELF STILL FARTHER IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN TETE A TETE WITH THE SAME NARRATOR OBSERVE THE SAME SILENCE AND LISTEN WITH AN AIR OF INTEREST
GOODNESS MODERATION AND DECORUM THESE ARE THE MOTTO AND THE SOUL OF MORAL PROPRIETY IN CONVERSATION A SOLICITUDE TO BE ALWAYS AGREEABLE AND OBLIGING OF OBSERVING A PROPER MEDIUM IN EVERYTHING
EVEN BY THOSE WHO ARE THE SUBJECTS OF IT IT IS A FRIENDLY AND SPORTIVE CONTEST IN WHICH SEVERITY JEALOUSY AND RESENTMENT SHOULD NEVER APPEAR WHENEVER YOU PERCEIVE THE LEAST TRACE OF THEM THE PLEASANTRY IS AT AN END DESIST THEN THE MOMENT THEY APPEAR
LEAVE OTHERS TO POINT OUT THE STRIKING PARTS WHICH HAVE PLEASED THEM THE SUREST MEANS OF NOT HAVING THE APPROBATION OF OTHERS IN ACTIONS AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS IS TO SOLICIT IT WHETHER IT BE BY LOOKS OR BY WORDS
POLITENESS AND TASTE CANNOT AT ALL EXIST IN COMPARISONS IF THEY ARE COMMON OR TRIVIAL AS WHEN WE SAY BLACK AS THE CHIMNEY BACK
OR THOSE WHO ARE NATURALLY UNFORTUNATE TO SPEAK OF THE POWER THAT WEALTH BESTOWS IN THE PRESENCE OF PEOPLE HARDLY ARRIVED AT MEDIOCRITY OF FORTUNE
AND SHOULD NEVER PRESENT ANY THING BY EXTENDING THE ARM OVER HER BUT WE PASS ROUND BEHIND AND PRESENT IT IN CASE WE CANNOT DO IT WE SAY
OR ELSE HASTEN TO REPLY BEFORE THEY HAVE RECEIVED IT THIS IS IN BAD TON INQUIRIES ABOUT THE HEALTH IT IS TRUE ARE FREQUENTLY UNIMPORTANT BUT THEY SHOULD APPEAR TO BE DICTATED BY ATTENTION AND KINDNESS WE MUST NOT HOWEVER BE DECEIVED
LAWYERS LITERARY PEOPLE MILITARY MEN TRAVELLERS INVALIDS AND AGED LADIES OUGHT TO HAVE A PRUDENT AND CONTINUAL DISTRUST OF THE ABUSE OF DIGRESSIONS
YOU ASK A DRY QUESTION DICTATED BY A COLD CURIOSITY IF YOU SEEM TO PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE ANSWERS WHICH YOU CALL FORTH IF YOU MAL ADROITLY TAKE A COMMANDING TONE IF YOU PROLONG WITHOUT BOUNDS THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION
LET THERE BE MODERATION IN EVERYTHING SHOULD WE NOT REGARD AS GROSS AND RIDICULOUS LANGUAGE THAT EXAGGERATION WHICH WE FREQUENTLY HEAR USED IN PRAISE AS WELL AS IN CENSURE IT SEEMS THAT TRUE POLITENESS IN LANGUAGE CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY
IT IS ALWAYS PROPER TO GIVE THE NAME OF SIR MADAM OR MISS AND IF THE SENTENCE IS SOMEWHAT LONG THE TITLE OUGHT TO BE REPEATED IF THE QUESTION IS WITH REGARD TO ANSWERING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE OR NEGATIVE WE OUGHT NEVER TO SAY ROUGHLY YES OR NO
NATURAL AND SELDOM REPEATED AND THAT YOU TAKE CARE TO ANNOUNCE IT ALWAYS AND FINALLY IN ORDER NOT TO ABUSE IT YOU SHOULD MAKE A SKILFUL USE OF IT THE SECOND DEGREE OF DIGRESSION BECOMES MORE NICE FOR IT INCLUDES THOSE ACCESSORY REFLECTIONS
I AGREE WITH THEM BUT IN QUITE ANOTHER SENSE WE SHOULD NEVER ASK A THING OF ANY ONE WITHOUT SAYING WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS WILL YOU DO ME THE FAVOR
OF RESPECTING THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS EVEN IN THE MOST TRIFLING THINGS SUSCEPTIBILITY FOR EVERY THING WHICH IS CONNECTED WITH DELICACY
WHEN YOUNG PERSONS OUGHT SO CAREFULLY TO AVOID MAKING A PARADE OF A VAIN COLLEGE ERUDITION AND NOT SEEK THE REPUTATION OF A SAVANT BY EMPLOYING WORDS BORROWED FROM FOREIGN LANGUAGES OR SCIENTIFIC TERMS UNKNOWN IN GOOD SOCIETY
AND A MILD TONE IF YOU ARE OPPOSED YIELD WITH A GOOD GRACE IF YOU ARE WRONG YIELD ALSO ALTHOUGH YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT IF THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION IS OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE AND ESPECIALLY IF THE ONE WHO OPPOSES YOU IS A LADY OR AN OLD PERSON
TO EXPRESS THEM WITH MUCH CLEARNESS AND AN EASY ELEGANCE DO NOT HAVE THE TEMERITY TO WISH TO ANALYZE A BOOK OR A DRAMATIC PIECE YOU WOULD BE LAYING UP FOR YOURSELF A RUDE MORTIFICATION WHICH WOULD HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE INFLUENCE ON YOUR ENTREE INTO SOCIETY
KNOW THIS AND REMEMBER IT WELL THAT EVERY OTHER PREPARATION THAN THINKING WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SAY WILL MAKE YOU ACQUIRE TWO INTOLERABLE FAULTS AFFECTATION AND STIFFNESS TO CONCLUDE
THERE ARE HOWEVER SOME LITTLE RULES WHICH ARE NOT TO BE NEGLECTED IT IS PROPER TO VARY THE PHRASEOLOGY OF THESE FORMAL QUESTIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND WE MUST ABSTAIN FROM THEM ENTIRELY TOWARDS A SUPERIOR OR A PERSON WITH WHOM WE ARE BUT LITTLE ACQUAINTED
THE NAME OF POLITE PERSONS OR OF GOOD TON FOR IN POLITENESS THERE MUST BE GOOD FEELING BUT THOSE WHO INCESSANTLY STUDY TO TROUBLE AND WOUND PEOPLE WITHOUT TAKING ANY PRECAUTION EXCEPT TO DEPRIVE THEM
AND EXCEPT IN FAMILIAR CONVERSATION ARE ALTOGETHER MISPLACED IF THEY ARE FREQUENT CONVERSATION BECOMES A TEDIOUS GOSSIPPING IF INTRODUCED WITHOUT A SHORT PREVIOUS REMARK ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL TAKE PLACE
MERELY BY EXPRESSIONS OF DOUBT THEY SAY IF WHAT YOU ADVANCE IS TRUE IF WHAT MADAM SAYS IS POSITIVE
AND DISPOSE OF THE DETAILS YOU CAN PRODUCE IT WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT WHEN ARRIVED AT THIS POINT ABSTAIN FROM THESE KINDS OF ANALYSIS WHICH THOUGH INDEED MORE CORRECT SEEM LABORED THEY HAVE BESIDES LESS FREEDOM APPROPRIATENESS AND GRACE
OF COURSE ONE THAT IS ABSENT AN INEFFABLE RIDICULE VERY PROPERLY STIGMATIZES THE NARRATOR WE COME NOW TO WHAT SEEMS TO ME THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF CONVERSATION AND IF YOU ARE NOT SURE OF BEING ABLE TO CLASS YOUR IDEAS WITH REGULARITY
WHAT PLEASURE CAN WE FIND IN CAUSING LADIES TO BLUSH AND IN MERITING THE NAME OF A MAN OF BAD SOCIETY THERE ARE THOSE WHO THINK THAT THEY MAY ALLOW THEMSELVES EVERY KIND OF PLEASANTRY BEFORE CERTAIN PERSONS BUT A MAN OF GOOD TON
IT IS CUSTOMARY TO EMPLOY THE FEW MOMENTS OF A VISIT OF MERE POLITENESS IN LOOKING AT THE PORTRAITS WHICH ADORN THE FIREPLACE AND EVEN TAKING THEM DOWN IF YOU ARE INVITED TO DO IT IT WOULD BE THE EXTREME OF IMPOLITENESS TO SAY THAT THEY WERE FLATTERED
IF WE REPEL IT WE ONLY SEEM TO EXCITE IT THE MORE THUS WE SEE IN SUCH A CASE AND EVEN AMONG VERY CLEVER PERSONS TOO THOSE WHO REPLY BY SILLY EXCLAMATIONS AND BY RUDE ASSERTIONS YOU WERE LAUGHING AT ME THEY SAY
WHEN A STORY HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE NEWSPAPERS
AND THEY SHOULD BE TEMPERED WITH A SORT OF JUDGMENT THE SKILFUL USE OF WHICH IS ITSELF EVEN A EULOGIUM I REPEAT AS I HAVE OFTEN SAID
THIS METHOD OF SPEAKING IN ITALICS MAY BE STRIKING AND ARTLESS BUT IT OFTEN BECOMES OBSCURE AND TRIVIAL THE HABIT IS DANGEROUS AND ONE SHOULD USE THIS DIFFICULT DIGRESSION ONLY BEFORE INTIMATE FRIENDS
THEN YOU SHOULD REPLY BRIEFLY BUT GIVE THEM ASSURANCES OF YOUR REGARD AND THANK THEM POLITENESS INFUSES INTO VISITS OF SOME LITTLE CEREMONY A COLORING OF MODESTY GRACE AND DEFERENCE WHICH SHOULD BE PRESERVED WITH THE GREATEST CARE IN SPEAKING
NEVER DO ANYTHING FURTHER SOME INHERITED WEAKNESS SOMETHING THEY NEVER REALIZED THEY HAD BEFORE MAY CROP OUT DURING THIS PROCESS WEAK BACK TENDENCY OF SHOULDER BLADES TO OSSIFICATION
GATHER THE FAMILY ABOUT AS IF FOR A CORNER STONE DEDICATION AND THEN MAKE A RATHER IMPRESSIVE CEREMONY OF DRIVING IN THE FIRST STAKE BY GETTING YOUR LITTLE BOY TO SING THE FIRST TWELVE WORDS OF SOME PATRIOTIC AIR IF HE DOESN'T KNOW THE FIRST TWELVE
IT IS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN THAT THE NEWT ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE SMALLEST OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN ANIMALS
THAT WAS KEEPING COMPANY WITH A DAB OF MASHED POTATO IN THE BAY STATE LUNCH IT HAD A TRIFLE MORE FAT WAS JUST A SHADE PINKER AND PERHAPS A MICROMETER COULD HAVE DETECTED A BIT MORE BULK BUT SO FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED
BUT FOR ALL THAT I CAN'T SEEM TO FEEL THAT I AM HAVING A GOOD TIME WHILE I AM EATING IT IT STIMULATES THE SAME NERVE CENTERS IN ME THAT A LANTERN SLIDE LECTURE ON PALESTINE THE OLD AND THE NEW DOES
BUT HE SMILED GENIALLY WHEN HE TOOK MY ORDER AND WAS BACK WITH IT IN TWO MINUTES THE ARTICLE ITSELF WAS OF THE REGULATION SIZE CUT SOMEWHAT THINNER PERHAPS AND BORDERING ON THE GRAY IN HUE BUT UNDOUBTEDLY ROAST BEEF
I AM A PLEASANT ENOUGH SORT OF PERSON TO MEET SOCIALLY PREPARING THE GROUND FOR THE GARDEN THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT THE YOUNG GARDENER IS CALLED UPON TO DO IN FACT A GREAT MANY YOUNG GARDENERS
THEY HAVE A FISHCAKE SPECIAL IT IS ONE OF THE HUNDREDS OF SELF SERVING LUNCHROOMS WHERE YOU APPROACH THE MARBLE COUNTER AND GIVE YOUR ORDER IN A LOW TONE TO A MAN IN A BARBER'S COAT AND THEN REPEAT IT AT INTERVALS OF ONE MINUTE
ONLY A NEWT AND HAS HIS WEAKNESSES JUST AS ANY OF THE REST OF US AND I FOR ONE WOULD NOT HAVE IT DIFFERENT
JUST AS WE HAVE GONE UP TILL NOW HOWEVER ALTHOUGH I AM AN AMATEUR I SHALL HAVE TO ADOPT IN MY WRITING THE TONE OF A PROFESSIONAL OR I SHALL NEVER GET ANY ONE TO BELIEVE WHAT I SAY
BUT APPARENTLY THE HOTEL RETAINERS WEREN'T TRAINED TO LOOK THROUGH A ROUGH EXTERIOR AND FIND THE STERLING QUALITIES BENEATH THEY LOOKED THROUGH MY ROUGH EXTERIOR ALL RIGHT BUT THEY DIDN'T STOP AT MY STERLING QUALITIES
HERE WAS THE CHANCE FOR THE ORDINARY ROAST BEEF TO BECOME A VERITABLE DAINTY WITH SOME CHARACTER SOME DISTINCTIVE TOUCH THAT SHOULD LIFT IT ABOVE ALL THAT ROAST BEEF HAS EVER MEANT BEFORE I ENTERED THE DINING ROOM IN HIGH HOPES
THE SALVAGE WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BOY'S MITTEN AS FOR THE TASTE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE THAT I COULD DETECT WAS THAT ONE HAD BEEN HOT AND THE OTHER COLD AND INCIDENTALLY THE WAITER HAD SOME BOSOM FRIENDS IN THE NEXT ROOM
LET US LOOK CLOSER AND SEE WHAT IT IS THAT THEY ARE DOING THE ONE IN THE LEAD IS DRAGGING A BIT OF GURRY OUT FROM THE WATER AND UP OVER THE EDGE INTO THE SUNLIGHT FOLLOWING HIM IN SINGLE FILE COME THE REST OF THE MASTER DRAGGERS
YOU MAY FEEL THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE AND UNSYSTEMATIC TO GO ABOUT DIGGING UP A FORKFUL HERE AND A SHOVELFUL THERE TOSSING THE EARTH AT RANDOM IN THE HOPE THAT IN DUE TIME YOU WILL GET THE PLACE DUG UP AND SO IT WOULD
I NIBBLED AT MY ROAST BEEF BUT MY SPIRIT WAS BROKEN I HAD GONE THROUGH A WEEK OF SELF DENIAL ORDERING ROAST BEEF WHEN I CRAVED EDIBLES EATING AT RESTAURANTS WHILE MY FAMILY WAITED FOR ME AT HOME
THE THING TO DO IS TO DECIDE JUST WHERE YOU WANT YOUR GARDEN AND WHAT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE TO BE THIS WILL HAVE NECESSITATED A PREVIOUS DRAWING UP OF A CHART SHOWING JUST WHAT IS TO BE PLANTED AND WHERE
AN IDEAL EXISTENCE I'LL TELL THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD OVER HERE ON THE RIGHT OF THE LOG ARE THE MASTER DRAGGERS OF ALL THE NEWT WORKERS THEY ARE THE MOST FUTILE WHICH IS HIGH PRAISE INDEED COME
THE NECESSITY FOR WORK OF SUCH A STRENUOUS NATURE IN THE MERE PRELIMINARIES OF THE PROCESS OF PLANTING A GARDEN IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE AVERAGE BACK YARD HAS UP TILL THE PRESENT TIME
AND SO DIDN'T SAMPLE IT BUT I DID HELP MYSELF TO THE PLATE PILED HIGH WITH FRESH BREAD WHICH WAS LEFT IN FRONT OF ME ALL IN ALL IT WAS WHAT I SHOULD CALL A REPRESENTATIVE ROAST BEEF DINNER AND I GOT MORE THAN TEN CENTS WORTH OF CALORIES I KNOW
SOME OF THE BOLDER MALES MAY NOW AND THEN ATTEMPT TO OVERSTEP THE BOUNDS OF GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP AND CROWD IN TO FORTY FIVE PACES BUT SUCH TACTICS ARE FROWNED UPON BY THE RULES COMMITTEE TO THE EYE OF AN UNINITIATED OBSERVER
I WOULD BE WILLING TO BE QUOTED AS SAYING THAT NATURE IS WONDERFUL IN FACT I WOULD TAKE IT AS A PERSONAL FAVOR AND WOULD FEEL THAT ANYTHING THAT I MIGHT DO IN THE FUTURE FOR NATURE
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO READ THE BRUSK PROSY DIRECTIONS ON PLANTING AS GIVEN THERE YOU MAY FIND THE SAME THING DONE IN VERSE IN YOUR FAVORITE POETRY MAGAZINE OR A SPECIAL DEPARTMENT IN THE PLUMBING AGE UNDER THE HEADING
FIVE MINUTES LATER ANOTHER MAN PLACED A KNIFE AND SPOON AT MY PLATE LATER IN THE EVENING A BOY WITH A BASKET OF ROLLS WANDERED BY AND DEPOSITED ONE ON MY TABLE WITH A PAIR OF PINCERS PERSONALLY I WAS RATHER GLAD THAT IT WAS WORKING OUT THIS WAY
AS IF YOU WERE IMPERSONATING AN OLD COLORED WAITER WITH THE LUMBAGO BUT THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS EACH WITH ITS OWN THEORY AS TO THE LESS PAINFUL METHOD ONE ADVOCATES BENDING OVER WITHOUT ONCE RAISING UP
A SPADE AND A RAKE IF YOU HAVE AN EMPTY AND DETACHED FURNACE BOILER YOU MIGHT BRING THAT ALONG TO FILL WITH THE STONES YOU WILL DIG UP IF IT IS A SMALL GARDEN YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE TO EMPTY THE BOILER MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR TIMES
BUT BEFORE I KNEW IT I WAS INSIDE AND SEATED AT AN OILCLOTH COVERED TABLE SAYING IN A HOARSE VOICE ROAST BEEF THE WAITER WAS DRESSED IN AN INFORMAL COSTUME WITH HIS SHIRT SLEEVES ROLLED UP
APPEAR TO BE CONDUCTED BY PROFESSIONALS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LAYMAN WHICH SEEMS TO ME TO BE A RATHER ONE SIDED WAY OF GOING ABOUT THE THING OBVIOUSLY THE SUGGESTIONS SHOULD COME FROM A LAYMAN HIMSELF
AND HERE WAS THE RESULT OF MY RESEARCHES ROAST BEEF IS ROAST BEEF AND NOTHING CAN PREVENT IT FROM THE TEN CENT ORDER OF THE BUSY HOME RESTAURANT UP THROUGH TO THE PIECE I WAS THEN EATING IT WAS THE SAME GRIM REALITY
BUSY HOME RESTAURANT ON A BLACK BOARD IN FRONT WAS WRITTEN ROAST BEEF MASHED POTATOES AND COFFEE TEN CENTS MY OLD HUNGER AGAIN SEIZED ME I SAID TO MYSELF LOOK HERE BE A MAN THIS THING IS GETTING THE BEST OF YOU
BUT I MUST TAKE CREDIT TO MYSELF FOR ONE THING
IT MAY SEEM THAT I HAVE SPENT MOST OF MY TIME IN ADVICE ON PREPARING THE GROUND FOR PLANTING SUCH MAY WELL BE THE CASE AS THAT WAS AS FAR AS I GOT I THEN FOUND A MAN WHO LIKES TO DO THOSE THINGS
IF THEREFORE FROM NOW ON I SOUND A BIT COLD AND UNFRIENDLY YOU WILL REALIZE THAT A PROFESSIONAL AGRICULTURAL WRITER HAS TO HAVE SOME DIGNITY ABOUT HIS STUFF AND THAT BENEATH MY ROUGH EXTERIOR
DYNAMITE WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL THING TO USE BUT IT WOULD HAVE A TENDENCY TO GET THE DIRT INTO THE FRONT HALL AND TRACK UP THE STAIRS THIS NOT BEING PRACTICABLE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY BUT FOR YOU TO GET AT IT WITH A FORK OH DON BE SILLY
THE PLUMBER'S GARDEN HOW AND WHEN TO PLANT
AND SO LATE THIS AUTUMN I STOOD ERECT AND WALKED INTO MY HOUSE WHERE I IMMEDIATELY SET ABOUT THE COMPILATION OF THE NOTES I HAD MADE SO MUCH FOR THE NON TECHNICAL INTRODUCTION
FOR WHOSE BENEFIT HE WAS UNDULATING AND PUT IN HER PLACE IN SLOW SUCCESSION ANOTHER BUT LESS CHARMING FEMALE A PAPER WEIGHT OF BRONZE SHAPED LIKE A NEWT AND FINALLY A COMMON RUBBER ERASER
THAT LOOKED ENOUGH SIGHT BETTER THAN HIS BUT THERE IS NO USE IN MAKING A SCENE WHEN IT CAN BE AVOIDED DURING THE NEXT TWENTY MINUTES THE ORCHESTRA PLAYED ONCE AND I ATE MY ROLL THEN THE ROAST BEEF CAME ON A SILVER PLATTER
AS FAR AS THE BATHTUB AND WITHOUT OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE
IT TOO HAD AN AFFINITY FOR ITS OWN GRAVY AND HID ITSELF MODESTLY UNDER AN AVALANCHE OF MASHED POTATOES A CUP OF COFFEE WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE TEN CENTS INITIAL EXPENSE BUT I SOMEHOW WASN'T COFFEE THIRSTY THAT NIGHT
FROM MUCH LYING IN A RESEARCH POSTURE ON MY STOMACH OVER THE INCLOSURE IN WHICH THEY WERE CONFINED I FOUND MYSELF DEVELOPING WHAT I FEARED MIGHT BE RUDIMENTARY CREEPERS
THINGS THAT PERHAPS IN THEIR HEY DEY WERE RATHER STUNNING BUT WHICH HAVE NOW ASSUMED AN AIR OF INDIFFERENCE AS IF TO SAY OH CALL ME ANYTHING OLD FELLOW ICE PICK MAINSPRING CIGAR LIGHTER
UNTIL THE WHOLE ROW IS DUG THE OTHERS OF WHOM I MUST CONFESS THAT I AM ONE FEEL THAT IT IS BETTER TO DRAW THE BODY
AS TO BE REPRESENTED BY A DIFFERENT ASSEMBLYMAN HERE I FELT WOULD BE THE TEST COULD ROAST BEEF COME BACK SURROUNDED BY GLITTERING CHANDELIERS AND RICH TAPESTRIES SNOWY TABLE LINEN AND SILVER SERVICE
HOWEVER I HAVE NOTICED THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT BORED BY IT IN FACT I HAVE SEEN THEM DELIBERATELY ORDER IT IN A RESTAURANT WHEN THEY HAD THE CHOICE OF SOMETHING ELSE SO I THOUGHT THAT THE ONLY FAIR THING I COULD DO WOULD BE TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER AND SEE IF
TO THE FLASH OF A DIAMOND SCARFPIN IN A RED NECKTIE THIS GLOW ACCORDING TO STRUDLEHOFF SO FASCINATES THE FEMALE WITH ITS AIR OF ELEGANCE AND INDICATION OF WEALTH THAT SHE IMMEDIATELY FALLS A VICTIM TO ITS LURE
WHERE BUSINESS MEN ARE WONT TO GATHER FOR LUNCHEON MEN WHO PRIDE THEMSELVES ON THEIR ACUMEN AND ADHERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF EFFICIENCY THE PLACE HAS A FRENCH NAME
GESTICULATING IN AMOROUS FASHION WITH HIS HIND FEET IN THE AIR
THE BUSY ARMY OF NEWTS GO ON MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE IN WHICH TO LIVE THEY HAVE THEIR LITTLE TRIALS AND TRAGEDIES IT IS TRUE
GARDENING NOTES DURING THE PAST MONTH ALMOST EVERY PAPER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE AGRICULTURAL JOURNALS HAS INSTALLED AN AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT CONTAINING SHORT ARTICLES BY LORD NORTHCLIFFE
WOULD BE LITTLE ENOUGH IN RETURN FOR THE SPECIAL WORK SHE WENT TO ALL THE TROUBLE OF DOING FOR ME BUT ALL OF THIS IS ON CONDITION THAT SOMETHING OF MINE GROWS INTO MANHOOD OTHERWISE NATURE CAN GO HER WAY AND I GO MINE
THESE INVESTIGATIONS MAY NOT PROVE TO BE MUCH OF A CONTRIBUTION TO MODERN SCIENCE OR ECONOMICS I DOUBT IF THEY ARE EVER INCORPORATED IN ANY TEXTBOOK EVEN IF IT SHOULD BE A TEXTBOOK ON THIS VERY SUBJECT
OR SOME ONE ELSE IN THE OFFICE WHO HAD AN UNOCCUPIED TYPEWRITER TELLING THE AMERICAN CITIZEN HOW TO START AND HOLD THE INTEREST OF A SMALL GARDEN THE SEED CATALOGUE HAS BECOME THE CATECHISM OF THE PATRIOT
AND NOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN HOW WONDERFULLY NATURE WORKS IN THE FULFILMENT OF HER LAWS EVEN AMONG HER TINIEST CREATURES LET US STUDY FOR A MINUTE A CROSS SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY LIFE OF THE NEWT
IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS INDICATE HER WILLINGNESS TO GO THROUGH WITH THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY AT AN EARLY DATE IT WAS STRUDLEHOFF WHO DISCOVERED
EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE RUBBER ERASER TO GYRATE AND UNDULATE IN A MOST CONSCIENTIOUS MANNER STILL UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS MAKING A CONQUEST AT LAST WORN OUT BY HIS EXERTIONS
BY PRETENDING TO GIVE IN AND THEN LATER IN THE DAY SNEAKING OUT AND SLIPPING THE SPROUTS IN BY THEMSELVES IN SOME SPOT WHERE THEY WILL KNOW WHERE TO FIND THEM AGAIN HAVING DECIDED ON THE GENERAL PLAN AND DIMENSIONS OF THE PLOT
BUT SO FAR I HAD KEPT BELOW THE FOURTEENTH STREET BELT IN MY INVESTIGATIONS ROAST BEEF IS A COSMOPOLITAN HABIT AND KNOWS NO ARBITRARY BOUNDARIES SO I WENT UPTOWN INTO ONE OF THE LARGER OF OUR LARGEST HOTELS
HAS SUCCEEDED IN DRAGGING HIS PRIZE TO THE RIDGE OF THE LOG THE LITTLE WORKERS REACHING THE GOAL WITH THEIR PRECIOUS FREIGHT ARE NOW GIVING IT OVER TO THE MASTER PUSHERS WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THEM IN THE SUN ALL THIS WHILE
YOUR MARKET IS LIMITED ONLY BY THE NUMBER OF NEIGHBORS WHO ARE BUILDING STONE HOUSES ON THE FIRST DAY WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF CONFRONTED BY A STRETCH OF UNTOUCHED GROUND WHICH IS TO BE TURNED OVER TECHNICAL PHRASE MEANING TO TURN OVER
AND WHOSE DOCTOR HAS TOLD HIM THAT HE OUGHT TO BE OUT OF DOORS ALL THE TIME HE IS AN ITALIAN AND CHARGES REALLY VERY LITTLE WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT HE ACCOMPLISHES
QUARRIES IRON MINES
FROM THE DISTANCE AT WHICH THE COURTSHIP WAS BEING CARRIED ON THE MALE WHO WAS IT MUST BE ADMITTED A BIT NEAR SIGHTED CONGENITALLY WAS UNABLE TO DETECT THE CHANGE IN PERSONNEL AND CONTINUED
RECOUNTS HAVING OBSERVED A DISTINCT AND DELIBERATE UNDULATION OF THE BODY BEGINNING WITH THE SHOULDERS AND ENDING AT THE FILAMENT OF THE TAIL WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN THE ORIGIN OF WHAT IS KNOWN TO DAY IN SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES AS THE SHIMMY
AND IT TAKES THE CLOSEST KIND OF COMMUNITY TEAM WORK IN THE NEWT COLONY TO GET THINGS ANYWHERE NEAR CLEANED UP BY NIGHTFALL IT IS EARLY MORNING AND THE WORKERS ARE JUST APPEARING HURRYING TO THE OLD LOG WHICH IS TO BE THE SCENE OF THEIR LABORS
CLAD IN A WALKING SUIT OF VIRILE TWEED I CONSIDERED MYSELF RESPECTABLY DRESSED NOT OSTENTATIOUSLY RESPECTABLE MIND YOU BUT SINCE MOST OF THE OTHER DINERS WERE IN EVENING DRESS RATHER DISTINGUE I THOUGHT
THEY ARE NOT DRAGGING ANYTHING BUT ARE SORT OF HELPING THE LEADER BY CROWDING AGAINST HIM AND EATING LITTLE PIECES OUT OF THE FILAMENT OF HIS TAIL AND NOW THEY HAVE REACHED THE TOP THE LEADER BY DINT OF MUCH LEG WORK
HERE THE ROAST BEEF SHOT THROUGH THE PUNCH AND JUDY ARRANGEMENT IN THE WALL A PIECE OF MEAT ABOUT AS LARGE AROUND AS A MAN'S SIZE MITTEN STEEPING IN ITS OWN GRAVY
THUS LITTLE CREATURE DID YOUR ROMANCE END AND WHO SHALL SAY THAT ITS ENDING WAS ONE WHIT LESS TRAGIC THAN THAT OF CAMILLE NOT I FOR ONE IN FACT THE TWO CASES ARE NOT AT ALL ANALOGOUS
THE ONLY JUSTIFICATION FOR A DIFFERENCE IN PRICE BEING A SILVER SALVER OR A WAITER IN A TUXEDO BUT I SAID TO MYSELF EIGHTY CENTS ISN'T SO MUCH AT THAT
WHAT A SCAMPERING WHAT A BUSTLE AH LITTLE SCAMPERERS AH LITTLE BUSTLERS HOW LUCKY YOU ARE AND HOW WISE YOU WORK LONG HOURS WITHOUT PAY FOR THE SHEER LOVE OF WORKING
THIS QUITE RECONCILED ME UNTIL MY CHECK WAS BROUGHT THERE ADDED TO THE INITIAL EXPENSE OF EIGHTY CENTS WAS THE UPKEEP SUCH AS
YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT THEY HAVE BEEN DRIFTING ALONG IN A FOOLS PARADISE ACCUMULATING STONES AND QUEER INDISTINGUISHABLE CANS AND THINGS
PERSONALLY I CLASS ROAST BEEF WITH WATERCRESS AND VANILLA CORNSTARCH PUDDING AS TASTY ARTICLES OF DIET IT UNDOUBTEDLY HAS MORE THAN THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF CALORIES
THE PAIR MIGHT BE DANCING A FEW OF THE MORE OPEN FIGURES OF THE MINUET THE MEANS EMPLOYED BY THE MALES TO DRAW THE ATTENTION AND WIN THE AFFECTION OF THOSE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX FEMALES
BUT THE LITTLE CREATURE TRUE TO HER SEX INSTINCT DOES NOT AT ONCE GIVE EVIDENCE THAT HER MORALE HAS BEEN SHATTERED SHE AFFECTS A COYNESS AND LACK OF INTEREST BY HITCHING HERSELF SIDEWAYS ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE AQUARIUM
OR SO FAR AS THE CALORIES WERE CONCERNED IT WAS THE SAME I WON'T SAY THAT IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ROAST BEEF SPECIAL OF THE BOWERY RESTAURANT BECAUSE THE SERVICE IN THE BOWERY RESTAURANT WAS INFINITELY BETTER AS A FITTING GARNITURE TO SUCH A DISH
I LOOKED OVER THE MENU AS IF I WERE IN A PRETTY CAPTIOUS MOOD AND THEN WITH THE AIR OF AN EPICURE WHO HAS TASTED TO THE DREGS ALL THE CONDIMENTS OF ARABIA AND WHOSE JADED PALATE REFUSES TO THRILL ANY LONGER I ORDERED
IN THIS GREAT CITY THERE WEREN'T SOME DIFFERENT WAYS OF SERVING ROAST BEEF TO VARY ITS MONOTONY ROAST BEEF IS NOT THE SAME PRICE IN ALL EATING PLACES WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE
THEY LOOKED RIGHT THROUGH TO THE MAN BEHIND ME AND GAVE HIM THE SIGNAL THAT THERE WAS A SEAT FOR HIM NOT TO BE OUTDONE HOWEVER I GOT MY PLACE IN THE SUN BY CLEVERLY TRIPPING MY RIVAL AS HE PASSED ME SO THAT HE FELL INTO THE FOUNTAIN ARRANGEMENT
AS THIS CHART WILL BE THE CAUSE OF CONSIDERABLE HARD FEELING IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE USUALLY PRECIPITATING A FIST FIGHT OVER THE NUMBER OF ROWS OF ONIONS TO BE SET OUT I WILL NOT TOUCH ON THAT IN THIS ARTICLE
BUT I MIGHT HAVE REALLY BEEN IN A HURRY FOR MY DINNER IT WASN'T LONG AS THE CROW FLIES BEFORE ONE OF THE THIRD ASSISTANT WAITERS UNLOOSENED ENOUGH TO DROP ROUND AND SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE I WANTED BESIDES ONE ROLL AND A KNIFE AND SPOON
AND MY LITTLE MASTER PUSHERS AND WELL DONE TOO WOULD THAT MY OWN WORK WERE AS CLEAN CUT AND AS SATISFYING AND SO IT GOES DAY IN AND DAY OUT
AND TO THIS MUST BE ADDED THE MODEST FEE OF TWENTY CENTS TO THE WAITER AND TEN CENTS TO THE HAT BOY WHO GAVE ME THE WRONG HAT TOTAL EXPENSE FOR ONE PIECE OF ROAST BEEF
THERE ARE SOME THINGS TOO INTIMATE FOR EVEN A PROFESSIONAL AGRICULTURIST TO WRITE OF I WILL SAY HOWEVER THAT THOSE IN THE FAMILY WHO ARE STANDING OUT FOR ONIONS MIGHT MUCH BETTER SAVE THEIR TIME AND FEELINGS
THE PECULIAR THING ABOUT A NEWT'S COURTSHIP IS ITS RESTRAINT IT IS CARRIED ON AT ALL TIMES WITH A MINIMUM DISTANCE OF FIFTY PACES NEWT MEASURE BETWEEN THE MALE AND THE FEMALE
THIS PART OF THEIR DAY'S TASK FINISHED THE TINY TOILERS REST CLUSTERED TOGETHER IN A GROUP WAVING THEIR HEADS ABOUT FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS WHO SHOULD SAY THERE THAT'S DONE
WHEN I WAS A BOY I USED TO HAVE TO DIG ESCAROLE OUT OF THE FRONT LAWN WITH A TROWEL SO THAT THE GRASS COULD HAVE A CHANCE FOR SEVENTY FIVE CENTS THE MEAT BULKED A LITTLE LARGER THAN AT THE BAY STATE LUNCH BUT WHEN THE FAT HAD BEEN CUT AWAY AND TRIMMED OFF
WHO FASCINATED HIM SO THAT IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO MAKE HIM SEE THAT IF HE DIDN'T COME AROUND TO ME ONCE IN A WHILE JUST AS A MATTER OF FORM THERE WOULD BE NO WAY FOR ME TO TIP HIM BEEF AND SALAD PLUS TIP NINETY CENTS
THAT MAKES IT DISTINCTIVE FROM THE SPECIAL TO DAY ROAST BEEF AND MASHED POTATOES OF THE BOWERY RESTAURANT TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS I STARTED OUT ON A TOUR OF THE REPRESENTATIVE EATING PLACES
IS FLASHING HIS GLEAMER FRANTICALLY TWO BLOCKS AWAY AND IS PERFORMING ALL SORTS OF ATTRACTIVE FEATS CALCULATED TO BRING THE LADY NEWT TO TERMS I HAVE SEEN A MALE IN THE STRESS OF HIS HANDICAP COURTSHIP STAND ON HIS FORE FEET
ARE VARIED AND EXTREMELY STRATEGIC UNTIL THE VALUABLE RESEARCHES BY STRUDLEHOFF IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IN HIS ENTWICKELUNGSMECHANIK NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN JUST WHAT IT WAS THAT THE MALE NEWT DID
IN STUDYING THE MORE INTIMATE PHASES OF NEWT LIFE ONE IS CHIEFLY IMPRESSED WITH THE METHODS BY MEANS OF WHICH THE MALES FORCE THEIR ATTENTIONS UPON THE FEMALES WITH MATRIMONY AS AN OBJECT FOR THE NEWT IS AFTER ALL
THE OBJECT SEEMS TO BE THE SAME EXCEPT THAT IN THE CASE OF THE NEWT IT IS THE MALE WHO IS THE ACTIVE AGENT IN ORDER TO TEST THE POWER OF OBSERVATION IN THE MALE DURING THESE MANUVERS I CAREFULLY REMOVED THE FEMALE
OF SOME OF OUR BEST KNOWN STRATA OF SOCIETY AND WHATEVER MY CONCLUSIONS ARE YOU MAY BE SURE THAT THEY ARE THOROUGHLY INEXPERT FIRST I TRIED OUT WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE BAY STATE LUNCH SO CALLED BECAUSE ON THURSDAYS
BEEN BEHAVING LESS LIKE A GARDEN THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD YOU MIGHT THINK THAT A BACK YARD POSSESSED OF AN ORDINARY AMOUNT OF DECENCY AND CIVIC PRIDE WOULD AT SOME TIME DURING ITS CAREER HAVE SAID TO ITSELF
QUESTIONABLE TASTE ON HIS PART WITHOUT DOUBT BUT ALL IS FAIR IN PATHOLOGICAL LOVE THAT THE MALE DURING THE COURTING SEASON THE SEASON OPENS ON THE TENTH OF MARCH AND EXTENDS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING FEBRUARY
TO MAKE THE FEMALE SEE ANYTHING IN HIM WORTH THROWING HERSELF AWAY ON IT HAD BEEN OBSERVED THAT THE MOST PERSONALLY UNATTRACTIVE NEWT COULD ADVANCE TO WITHIN FIFTY PACES OF A FEMALE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND
WITH A SILVER COVER IT WAS PLACED BEFORE ME UNDER THE BEST POSSIBLE SCENIC CONDITIONS BUT THE THING THAT MET MY GAZE WHEN THE COVER WAS LIFTED MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE BEEN THE SAME PROPERTY PIECE OF ROAST BEEF
THERE WAS A CORSAGE OF WATERCRESS DRAPED ON THE CORNER OF THE SALVER AT ANY RATE IT COULD BE SAID FOR IT THAT IT WAS NOT INTOXICATING AND SO COULD NEVER CAUSE ANY REAL MISERY IN THIS WORLD
YOU MAY BE SOMEWHAT AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN SUCH INDECISION IS ONLY NATURAL AND SHOULD CAUSE NO WORRY ON THE PART OF THE YOUNG GARDENER IT IS SOMETHING WE ALL HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH
ANYTHING BUT GARDENS I HAVE SAVED IN A BOX ALL THE THINGS THAT I HAVE DUG FROM MY BACK YARD AND WHEN I HAVE THEM ASSEMBLED ALL I WILL NEED WILL BE A GOOD ENGINE TO MAKE THEM INTO A PRETTY FAIRLY DECENT RUNABOUT
ANY NEIGHBOR WHO IS BUILDING A STONE HOUSE WILL BE GLAD TO CONTRACT WITH YOU FOR THE STONES AND THOSE THAT ARE LEFT OVER AFTER HE HAS GOT HIS HOUSE BUILT CAN BE SOLD TO ANOTHER NEIGHBOR WHO IS BUILDING ANOTHER STONE HOUSE
ANYTHING I DON'T CARE I TELL YOU IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE A MAN STOP AND THINK BUT THERE I MUSTN'T GET SENTIMENTAL IN PREPARING THE SOIL FOR PLANTING YOU WILL NEED SEVERAL TOOLS
WITH HER HEAD TURNED OVER HER RIGHT SHOULDER AWAY FROM THE SWAIN A TRAINED EAR MIGHT EVEN DETECT HER WHISTLING IN AN INDIFFERENT MANNER THE MALE IN THE MEANTIME
NOW LOOK HERE I MAY SOME DAY BE CALLED UPON TO BE A GARDEN AND THE LEAST I CAN DO IS TO GET MYSELF INTO SOME SORT OF SHAPE SO THAT WHEN THE TIME COMES I WILL BE FAIRLY READY TO RECEIVE A SEED OR TWO BUT NO
IN THE NATURE OF WARNINGS TO OTHERS I AM QUALIFIED TO PUT FORTH SUCH AN ARTICLE BECAUSE OF TWO WEEKS SERVICE IN MY OWN BACK YARD DOING MY BIT FOR PETER HENDERSON
AND DISGUSTED AT THE MEAGERNESS OF THE REACTION ON THE ERASER HE GAVE A LOW CRY OF RAGE AND DESPAIR AND STAGGERED TO A NEARBY PAN CONTAINING BARLEY WATER FROM WHICH HE PROCEEDED TO DRINK HIMSELF INTO A GROSS STUPOR
EACH TIME LOUDER AND EACH TIME TO A DIFFERENT MAN UNTIL YOU ARE FORCED TO POINT TO A TUB OF SALMON SALAD AND SAY SOME OF THAT FOR WHICH YOUR TICKET IS PUNCHED AND YOU ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE YOUR PORTION AND NURSE IT ON THE OVER DEVELOPED ARM OF A CHAIR
THE MASTER PUSHERS WORK IS SOON ACCOMPLISHED FOR IT CONSISTS SIMPLY IN PUSHING THE PIECE OF GURRY OVER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOG UNTIL IT FALLS WITH A SPLASH INTO THE WATER WHERE IT IS LOST
ALL ARE APT TO BE DISCOVERED FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING THE COURSE OF ONE DAY'S DIGGING IF ON THE MORNING FOLLOWING THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO PREPARE THE GROUND FOR PLANTING YOU ARE ABLE TO WALK IN A SEMI ERECT POSITION
HAVE YOU QUARRELLED WITH THE BOY EXCLAIMED THE NUN LOOKING AT HER THERE WAS SOME RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE FEATURES OF THE CHILD AND THE NUN SO GENJI THOUGHT THAT SHE POSSIBLY MIGHT BE HER DAUGHTER INUKI HAS LOST MY SPARROW
I RODE AFTER YOU THE TRAIN WAS JUST GOING JUMPED INTO IT BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER THE STATION FOR YOU IT'S AWFULLY NICE OF YOU HERBERT DIDN'T I SAY GOOD BYE YOUR TICKET HE PRODUCED IT LEFT IT ON THE DRESSING TABLE HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH I TOLD YOU YOU WOULD
I DO NOT SEE THE REAL INTENT OF THE EFFUSION THOUGHT THE NUN PERHAPS HE THINKS THAT SHE IS ALREADY A WOMAN BUT SHE CONTINUED WONDERINGLY HOW COULD HE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE YOUNG GRASS
HOW SPLENDID IT LOOKS WOULD THAT SHE WOULD ALWAYS STRIVE TO KEEP IT THUS HER EXTREME YOUTH MAKES ME ANXIOUS HOWEVER HER MOTHER DEPARTED THIS LIFE WHEN SHE ONLY A VERY YOUNG GIRL BUT SHE WAS QUITE SENSIBLE AT THE AGE OF THIS ONE
THE DAY WAS FAR ADVANCED AND THE PRINCE PREPARED TO LEAVE THE MOUNTAIN THE HERMIT HOWEVER TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SPEND THE EVENING IN THE TEMPLE AND TO BE FURTHER PRAYED FOR HIS ATTENDANTS ALSO SUPPORTED THIS SUGGESTION
WHAT IS HOME WHEN YOU SPEAK TO THE STATION MASTER AT LONDON I SUPPOSE I'VE A GOOD MIND TO SAY SNAP EXTREMELY ANNOYED I STRODE OUT AND BUMPED INTO YOU'LL NEVER GUESS HERBERT
THE SCENERY WAS INDESCRIBABLY NOVEL THE ASCETIC LIVED IN A DEEP CAVE IN THE ROCKS NEAR THE LOFTY SUMMIT GENJI DID NOT HOWEVER DECLARE WHO HE WAS AND THE STYLE OF HIS RETINUE WAS OF A VERY PRIVATE CHARACTER
AND MIGHT HAVE MET WITH OBJECTIONS ON THE PART OF HIS WIFE AND CHILD FOR THIS REASON IT APPEARS THAT HE FINALLY SELECTED THE PLACE WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO FOR THE SAKE OF HIS FAMILY
AND FEELS DISAPPOINTED THAT HE HAS NOT YET HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO GENJI SAID IN REPLY
MIGHT BE HEARD FROM AFAR BROKEN AND INDISTINCT ONE MIGHT HEAR THE MELANCHOLY SOUND OF THE SLEEPY INTONATION OF PRAYERS EVEN THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO SORROW OF THEIR OWN OFTEN FEEL MELANCHOLY FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY ARE PLACED
IT MIGHT NOT GRATIFY YOU THE LATE LORD AZECHI DAINAGON DIED LONG AGO AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM WELL HIS WIDOW IS MY SISTER AND SINCE HER HUSBAND'S DEATH HER HEALTH HAS NOT BEEN SATISFACTORY
WAS DEPRIVED BY DEATH OF MY BEST FRIEND MY MOTHER AND THE YEARS AND MONTHS WHICH THEN ROLLED BY WERE FRAUGHT WITH TROUBLE TO ME IN THAT SAME POSITION YOUR LITTLE ONE IS NOW ALLOW US THEN TO BECOME FRIENDS
THE ATTENDANT WHO HAD GIVEN THIS ACCOUNT OF THE EX GOVERNOR AND HIS DAUGHTER WAS THE SON OF THE PRESENT GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE HE WAS UNTIL LATELY A KURAND AND THIS YEAR HAD RECEIVED THE TITLE OF JUGOI HIS NAME WAS YOSHIKIYO
SOME OF THEM DESCRIBED TO HIM FUJI YAMA WHILE OTHERS TOLD HIM OF OTHER MOUNTAINS
WHAT A LOVELY GIRL HE HAD SEEN I CAN GUESS FROM THIS THOUGHT HE WHY THOSE GAY FELLOWS REFERRING TO HIS ATTENDANTS SO OFTEN MAKE THEIR EXPEDITIONS IN SEARCH OF GOOD FORTUNE WHAT A CHARMING LITTLE GIRL HAVE I SEEN TO DAY WHO CAN SHE BE
IN THE WESTERN ANTECHAMBER OF THE HOUSE WAS PLACED AN IMAGE OF BUDDHA AND HERE AN EVENING SERVICE WAS PERFORMED A NUN RAISING A CURTAIN BEFORE BUDDHA OFFERED A GARLAND OF FLOWERS ON THE ALTAR AND PLACING A KIO OR SUTRA
AH WELL THAT LEAVES A PENNY HA'PENNY TO BE DIVIDED BETWEEN THE PORTER THIS END LUNCH TEA THE PORTER THE OTHER END AND THE CAB I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ENOUGH EVEN IF I GAVE IT ALL TO THE PORTER HERE THINK HOW REPROACHFULLY HE WOULD LOOK AT YOU EVER AFTERWARDS
GENJI THEREFORE SENT FOR THE HERMIT BUT HE DECLINED TO COME SAYING THAT HE WAS TOO OLD AND DECREPIT TO LEAVE HIS RETREAT WHAT SHALL I DO EXCLAIMED GENJI SHALL I VISIT HIM PRIVATELY EVENTUALLY
ARE PERHAPS HAPPY AND CONTENTED NAY SAID THE ATTENDANTS BUT WERE YOU TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN RANGES AND THE SEA COAST IN OUR VARIOUS PROVINCES THE PICTURES WOULD INDEED BE FOUND LOVELY THEN
MANY PEOPLE HAD RECOVERED THROUGH HIS EXORCISMS IF ADDED THE FRIEND THE DISEASE IS NEGLECTED IT BECOMES SERIOUS TRY THEREFORE THIS METHOD OF PROCURING RELIEF AT ONCE AND BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE
AND SHE THEN REMAINED SILENT FOR A WHILE AT LAST THINKING IT WOULD BE UNBECOMING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF IT SHE GAVE ORALLY THE FOLLOWING REPLY TO THE ATTENDANT TO BE GIVEN TO GENJI YOU SAY YOUR SLEEVE IS WET WITH DEW
WHILE HE HIMSELF PROCEEDED TO PERFORM SOME MYSTERIOUS RITE DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS CEREMONY THE SUN ROSE HIGH IN THE HEAVENS GENJI MEANTIME WALKED OUT OF THE CAVE AND LOOKED AROUND HIM WITH HIS ATTENDANTS THE SPOT WHERE THEY STOOD WAS VERY LOFTY
YET HIS NOBILITY OF MANNERS WAS EASILY RECOGNIZABLE WELCOME YOUR VISIT CRIED THE HERMIT SALUTING HIM PERHAPS YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SENT FOR ME THE OTHER DAY I HAVE LONG SINCE QUITTED THE AFFAIRS OF THIS WORLD
I CANNOT INDEED POINT OUT IN DETAIL ITS MOST REMARKABLE FEATURES
GENJI NOW ENGAGED IN PRAYER UNTIL THE SUN SANK IN THE HEAVENS HIS ATTENDANTS WHO WERE ANXIOUS ABOUT HIS DISEASE TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR HIM TO HAVE A CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME HEREUPON HE ADVANCED TO THE BACK OF THE TEMPLE
BUT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN INCORRECTLY INFORMED IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A LITTLE GIRL DEPENDENT UPON MYSELF BUT SHE IS BUT A CHILD HER SOCIETY COULD NOT AFFORD YOU ANY PLEASURE AND FORGIVE ME THEREFORE
SHOULD BE SEIZED WITH AN ARDENT DESIRE TO POSSESS HER SHE WOULD NOT LONG REMAIN UNATTACHED WHAT POSSIBLE OBJECT COULD IT SERVE IF SHE WERE CARRIED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA THE NATIVES OF THE DEEP WOULD DERIVE NO PLEASURE FROM HER CHARMS
SHE WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD OR MORE AND WORE A WHITE SILK DRESS WHICH FITTED HER WELL AND WHICH WAS LINED WITH YELLOW HER HAIR WAS WAVED LIKE A FAN AND HER EYES WERE RED FROM CRYING WHAT IS THE MATTER
AND HIS GAZE FELL ON THE FAR OFF CAPITAL IN THE DISTANCE WHICH WAS ENVELOPED IN HAZE AS THE DUSK WAS SETTING IN OVER THE TOPS OF THE TREES AROUND WHAT A LOVELY LANDSCAPE EXCLAIMED GENJI THE PEOPLE TO WHOM SUCH SCENERY IS FAMILIAR
WELL THE MONEY WOULD LAST LONGER THAT WAY BUT UNLESS I COULD OVERCOME QUICKLY THE DISTRUST WHICH I SEEMED TO INSPIRE IN STATION MASTERS THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH LEFT FOR LUNCH I GAVE THE PORTER ALL I COULD AFFORD A HA'PENNY MENTIONED APOLOGETICALLY THAT I WAS COMING BACK AND STEPPED INTO THE TRAIN
FOR THAT REASON I WISH TO KEEP MY VISIT AS PRIVATE AS POSSIBLE NEVERTHELESS I WILL COME NOW TO YOUR MASTER THEREUPON THE PRIEST HIMSELF SOON MADE HIS APPEARANCE AND AFTER BRIEFLY RELATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES
STRANGE INDEED WOULD IT BE IF HE WERE TO DISCOVER THAT I AM HERE IN THIS PRIVACY THEY NOTICED A NUN AND A FEW MORE FEMALES WITH HER WALKING IN THE GARDEN WHO WERE CARRYING FRESH WATER FOR THEIR OFFERINGS AND WERE GATHERING FLOWERS
WHICH I KEPT SO CAREFULLY IN THE CAGE REPLIED THE CHILD THAT STUPID BOY SAID ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS HAS HE AGAIN BEEN THE CAUSE OF THIS WHERE CAN THE BIRD BE GONE AND ALL THIS TOO AFTER WE HAD TAMED IT WITH SO MUCH CARE
SHE THEN LEFT THE ROOM POSSIBLY TO LOOK FOR THE LOST BIRD THE PEOPLE WHO ADDRESSED HER CALLED HER SHIONAGON AND SHE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN THE LITTLE GIRL'S NURSE TO YOU SAID THE NUN TO THE GIRL
AND I DROVE AWAY AMIDST CHEERS CHEERS OF SORROW IT WAS HALF AN HOUR'S DRIVE TO THE STATION
WILL YOU SPEAK TO HER GRANDMOTHER ABOUT IT IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS ONE TO WHOM MY LOT IS LINKED BUT I CARE BUT LITTLE FOR HER AND INDEED USUALLY LEAD A SOLITARY LIFE YOUR OFFER IS VERY KIND REPLIED THE PRIEST
THE SPARROW MAY BE DEARER THAN I MAY BE WHO AM SO ILL BUT HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU OFTEN THAT THE CAGING OF BIRDS IS A SIN BE A GOOD GIRL COME NEARER
THE DEER TOO WHICH WERE TO BE SEEN HERE ADDED TO THE BEAUTY OF THE PICTURE GAZING AROUND AT THESE GENJI ONCE MORE PROCEEDED TO THE TEMPLE
WHICH WAS ALSO A GIRL AND ABOUT THIS GIRL THE GRANDMOTHER IS ALWAYS FEELING VERY ANXIOUS THEN SAID GENJI LET IT NOT APPEAR STRANGE TO YOU IF I SAY THIS BUT I SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO BECOME THE GUARDIAN OF THIS GIRL
HOW WOULD IT BE IF I HAD FREE CONTROL OVER HER AND HAD HER BROUGHT UP AND EDUCATED ACCORDING TO MY OWN NOTIONS SO THINKING HE PROCEEDED TO SAY HOW SAD IT WAS THAT SHE DIED DID SHE LEAVE ANY OFFSPRING SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD AT HER DEATH
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS TOO LATE NO UNFORTUNATELY IT WASN'T HE GOT THE TWO POUNDS THE MOST EXPENSIVE CIGARETTE I'VE EVER SMOKED WELL THAT JUST SHOWS YOU SAID HERBERT HERE'S YOUR TICKET PUT IT IN YOUR WAISTCOAT POCKET NOW
IF I DECLINE YOUR REQUEST YET LET THERE BE NO RESERVE IN THE EXPRESSION OF YOUR IDEAS INTERRUPTED GENJI BUT BEFORE THEY COULD TALK FURTHER THE RETURN OF THE PRIEST PUT AN END TO THE SUBJECT AND GENJI RETIRED TO HIS QUARTERS
WE COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH EACH OTHER TWAS TO REVEAL THESE WISHES TO YOU THAT I CAME HERE AND RISKED THE CHANCE OF OFFENDING YOU IN DOING SO BELIEVE ME I AM WELL DISPOSED AT YOUR OFFER SAID THE NUN
FOR SHE SILENTLY WATCHED THE EXPRESSION OF THE NUN'S FEATURES AND THEN WITH DOWNCAST EYES BENT HER FACE TOWARDS THE GROUND THE LUSTROUS HAIR FALLING OVER HER BACK IN WAVES THE NUN HUMMED IN A TONE SUFFICIENTLY AUDIBLE TO GENJI
THE FOUNTAIN WAS LIT UP BY TORCHES AND MANY LAMPS ALSO WERE LIGHTED IN THE GARDEN GENJI WAS TAKEN TO AN AIRY ROOM IN THE SOUTHERN FRONT OF THE BUILDING WHERE INCENSE WHICH WAS BURNING THREW ITS SWEET ODORS AROUND THE PRIEST RELATED TO HIM
SEVERAL PLACES WHICH ARE WELL SITUATED FOR QUIET RETIREMENT AND IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED INCONSISTENT IN HIM HAD HE PREFERRED A PART OF THE SEA COAST SO NEAR THE GAY WORLD NEVERTHELESS A RETREAT IN THE TOO REMOTE INTERIOR WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SOLITARY
I KNOW NOT HOW IT CAME TO PASS BUT SHE BECAME SECRETLY INTIMATE
THEY WERE VERY QUIET YET THE SOUND OF THE TELLING OF BEADS WHICH ACCIDENTALLY STRUCK THE LECTERN WAS HEARD FROM TIME TO TIME THE ROOM WAS NOT FAR FROM HIS OWN HE PULLED THE SCREEN SLIGHTLY ASIDE AND STANDING NEAR THE DOOR
THE DEWS THAT WET THE TENDER GRASS AT THE SUN'S BIRTH TOO QUICKLY PASS NOR E'ER CAN HOPE TO SEE IT RISE IN FULL PERFECTION TO THE SKIES SHIONAGON WHO NOW JOINED THEM AND HEARD THE ABOVE DISTICH
I HAD ONCE A DREAM WHICH MADE ME ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHO WAS LIVING IN THIS HOUSE AND HERE TO DAY THAT DREAM HAS AGAIN COME BACK TO MY MEMORY THE PRIEST LAUGHED AND SAID A STRANGE DREAM EVEN WERE YOU TO OBTAIN YOUR WISH
CONSOLED THE NUN WITH THE FOLLOWING THE DEWS WILL NOT SO QUICKLY PASS NOR SHALL DEPART BEFORE THEY SEE THE FULL PERFECTION OF THE GRASS THEY LOVED SO WELL IN INFANCY AT THIS JUNCTURE A PRIEST ENTERED AND SAID
THIS STATION MASTER WAS EVEN MORE UNEMOTIONAL THAN THE LAST HE ASKED ME IF I KNEW ANYBODY WHO COULD VOUCH FOR ME I MENTIONED HERBERT DIFFIDENTLY HE HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF HERBERT I SHOWED HIM MY GOLD WATCH MY SILVER CIGARETTE CASE
SUCCESSIVE GOVERNORS OFTEN OFFER THEIR ADDRESSES TO HER WITH GREAT SINCERITY BUT NO ONE HAS EVER YET BEEN ACCEPTED THE DOMINANT IDEA OF HER FATHER SEEMS TO BE THIS WHAT HAVE I SUNK TO SUCH A POSITION WELL I TRUST AT LEAST
SO GENJI MADE UP HIS MIND TO STAY THERE SAYING THEN I SHALL NOT RETURN HOME TILL TO MORROW THE DAYS AT THIS SEASON WERE OF LONG DURATION AND HE FELT IT RATHER TIRESOME TO PASS A WHOLE EVENING IN SEDATE SOCIETY SO
THIS AT LENGTH OBLIGED THE NUN TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PRINCE HE THEN TOLD HER THAT HE CALLED BUDDHA TO WITNESS THAT THOUGH HIS CONDUCT MAY HAVE SEEMED BOLD IT WAS DICTATED BY PURE AND CONSCIENTIOUS MOTIVES
IT WOULD HAUNT YOU THE STATION MASTER WAS EVIDENTLY MOVED HE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ASKED IF I KNEW ANYBODY WHO WOULD VOUCH FOR ME I MENTIONED HERBERT CONFIDENTLY HE HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF HERBERT
AND HE TOO WAS A MAN OF GAY HABITS WHICH GAVE OCCASION TO ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS TO OBSERVE AH PERHAPS YOU ALSO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DISAPPOINT THE HOPES OF THE AGED FATHER ANOTHER SAID WELL OUR FRIEND HAS GIVEN US A LONG ACCOUNT
AND THEREFORE BY THE ADVICE OF MY FRIENDS I CAME TO THIS MOUNTAIN TO BE EXORCISED IF HOWEVER THE SPELLS OF THE HOLY MAN ARE OF NO AVAIL TO ME HIS REPUTATION MIGHT SUFFER IN CONSEQUENCE
BUT I HAVEN'T GOT A WAISTCOAT ON SILLY WHICH ONE ARE YOU GOING TO PUT ON I DON'T KNOW YET THIS IS A MATTER WHICH REQUIRES THOUGHT GIVE ME TIME GIVE ME AIR
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO HE SAID IS TO TAKE A TICKET TO THE NEXT STATION AND TALK TO THEM THERE THIS IS ONLY A BRANCH LINE AND I HAVE NO POWER TO GIVE YOU A PASS SO THAT WAS WHAT I HAD TO DO
BUT THE PRINCE'S WIFE WAS VERY JEALOUS AND SEVERE SO SHE HAD MUCH TO SUFFER AND PUT UP WITH I SAW PERSONALLY THE TRUTH THAT CARE KILLS MORE THAN LABOR
THAT THERE IS NO ONE HERE TO WHOM SUCH THINGS CAN BE PRESENTED BELIEVE ME I HAVE MY OWN REASONS FOR THIS SAID GENJI LET ME BESEECH YOU TO TAKE IT SO THE ATTENDANT WENT BACK AND PRESENTED IT TO THE NUN
TAKING FOUR OR FIVE ATTENDANTS HE STARTED OFF EARLY ONE MORNING FOR THE PLACE WHICH WAS AT NO GREAT DISTANCE ON THE MOUNTAIN IT WAS THE LAST DAY OF MARCH AND THOUGH THE HEIGHT OF THE SEASON FOR FLOWERS IN THE CAPITAL WAS OVER YET
WELL WE NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT I'VE LEFT IT AT HOME HE DIDN'T SEEM INTENSELY EXCITED WHAT DID YOU THINK OF DOING HE ASKED I HAD RATHER HOPED THAT YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING YOU CAN BUY ANOTHER TICKET AND GET THE MONEY BACK AFTERWARDS
WHEN I WENT DOWN THERE LAST TIME I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FAMILY AND I FOUND THAT THOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN WELL RECEIVED IN THE CAPITAL YET THAT HERE HAVING BEEN FORMERLY GOVERNOR
ONCE UPON A TIME I LOST MY RETURN TICKET AND I HAD TO PAY TWO POUNDS FOR ANOTHER AND A MONTH AFTERWARDS I MET A MAN A MAN LIKE YOU WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT TICKETS AND HE SAID YOU COULD HAVE GOT THE MONEY BACK IF YOU HAD APPLIED AT ONCE SO I SAID
THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE FREE FROM THE STING OF THESE RECOLLECTIONS THROUGH HIS LIFE AND THAT THERE WAS A WORLD TO COME TOO OH COULD I BUT LIVE IN A RETREAT LIKE THIS PRIEST AS HE THUS THOUGHT OF A RETREAT
HE WENT OUT OF THE TEMPLE AND PROCEEDED TO THE PRETTY BUILDING ENCLOSED BY HEDGES ALL THE ATTENDANTS HAD BEEN DESPATCHED HOME EXCEPT KOREMITZ WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM THEY PEEPED AT THIS BUILDING THROUGH THE HEDGES
AT THE JUNCTION I JUMPED OUT QUICKLY AND DIVED INTO THE SACRED OFFICE I'VE LEFT MY TICKET ON THE DRESSING THAT IS TO SAY I FORGOT WELL ANYHOW I HAVEN'T GOT IT I BEGAN AND WE PLUNGED INTO EXPLANATIONS ONCE MORE
THAN MANY REGULAR PRIESTS HERE GENJI INTERRUPTED WHAT IS HIS DAUGHTER LIKE WITHOUT DOUBT ANSWERED HIS COMPANION THE BEAUTY OF HER PERSON IS UNRIVALLED AND SHE IS ENDOWED WITH CORRESPONDING MENTAL ABILITY
FEAR NOT THE DARKNESS I AM HERE SAID GENJI SIR REPLIED THE SERVANT TIMIDLY PRAY DO NOT THINK ME PRESUMPTUOUS SAID GENJI BUT MAY I BEG YOU TO TRANSMIT THIS POETICAL EFFUSION TO YOUR MISTRESS FOR ME
TIS BUT ONE NIGHT ALONE FOR YOU BUT THERE'S A MOUNTAIN MOSS GROWS NIGH WHOSE LEAVES FROM DEW ARE NEVER DRY WHEN GENJI HEARD THIS HE SAID
WHICH HAD OCCASIONED HIS RETIREMENT TO THIS LOCALITY HE OFFERED TO ESCORT GENJI TO HIS HOUSE SAYING MY DWELLING IS BUT A RUSTIC COTTAGE BUT STILL I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO SEE AT LEAST THE PRETTY MOUNTAIN STREAMLET WHICH WATERS MY GARDEN
SO LATELY SHE HAS BEEN LIVING HERE IN RETIREMENT AH YES SAID GENJI VENTURING UPON A GUESS AND I HEARD THAT SHE BORE A DAUGHTER TO DAINAGON YES SHE HAD A DAUGHTER BUT SHE DIED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
AFTER THANKING THE NUN FOR HIS KIND RECEPTION THE NIGHT PASSED AWAY AND DAWN APPEARED THE SKY WAS AGAIN HAZY AND HERE
AND WAS CUT SHORT BEHIND WHICH SUITED HER VERY WELL SHE WAS HOWEVER PALE AND WEAK HER VOICE ALSO BEING TREMULOUS TWO MAIDEN ATTENDANTS WENT IN AND OUT OF THE ROOM WAITING UPON HER
SAID HE WOULD RETURN AS SOON AS IT WAS FINISHED GENJI WAS ALONE A SLIGHT SHOWER FELL OVER THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY AND THE MOUNTAIN BREEZES BLEW COOL THE WATERS OF THE TORRENT WERE SWOLLEN AND THE ROAR OF THEM
AND HAVE ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE SECRET OF MY EXORCISMS I WONDER WHY YOU HAVE COME HERE FOR ME SO SAYING HE PLEASINGLY EMBRACED HIM HE WAS EVIDENTLY A MAN OF GREAT HOLINESS HE WROTE OUT A TALISMANIC PRESCRIPTION
I'VE GOT A TIE PIN I SAID STATION MASTERS HAVE A WEAKNESS FOR TIE PINS AND A WATCH AND A CIGARETTE CASE I SHALL BE HAPPY TO LEND YOU ANY OF THOSE THE IDEA DIDN'T APPEAL TO HIM
HE ENJOYS CONSIDERABLE POPULARITY AND RESPECT HIS RESIDENCE MOREOVER IS WELL APPOINTED AND OF SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE AND HE PERFORMS WITH PUNCTUALITY AND DEVOUTNESS HIS RELIGIOUS DUTIES NAY ALMOST WITH MORE EARNESTNESS
MANY INTERESTING ANECDOTES AND ALSO SPOKE ELOQUENTLY OF MAN'S FUTURE DESTINY GENJI AS HE HEARD HIM FELT SOME QUALMS OF CONSCIENCE FOR HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS OWN CONDUCT WAS FAR FROM BEING IRREPROACHABLE THE THOUGHT TROUBLED HIM
DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS VERY DAY PRINCE GENJI VISITED THE HERMIT IN ORDER TO BE EXORCISED BY HIM I MUST FORTHWITH GO AND SEE HIM GENJI OBSERVING THIS MOVEMENT QUICKLY RETURNED TO THE MONASTERY THINKING AS HE WENT
ONE REASON WHY GENJI WAS SO MUCH ATTRACTED BY HER WAS THAT SHE GREATLY RESEMBLED A CERTAIN LADY IN THE PALACE TO WHOM HE FOR A LONG TIME HAD BEEN FONDLY ATTACHED THE NUN STROKED THE BEAUTIFUL HAIR OF THE CHILD AND MURMURED TO HERSELF
HE STRUCK HIS FAN ON HIS HAND TO SUMMON SOME ONE WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER SAID AN ATTENDANT AND AS SHE CAME NEAR TO THE PRINCE'S ROOM SHE ADDED PERHAPS MY EAR WAS DECEIVED AND SHE BEGAN TO RETIRE BUDDHA WILL GUIDE YOU
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT GETTING UP WHEN HE CAME INTO MY ROOM HE LOOKED AT ME IN HORROR MY DEAR FELLOW HE SAID AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN PACKED YOU'LL BE LATE HERE GET UP AND I'LL PACK FOR YOU WHILE YOU DRESS DO I SAID BRIEFLY FIRST OF ALL WHAT CLOTHES ARE YOU GOING TO TRAVEL IN
THAT MY ONLY DAUGHTER MAY BE SUCCESSFUL AND PROSPEROUS IN HER LIFE HE OFTEN TOLD HER I HEARD THAT IF SHE SURVIVED HIM AND IF HIS FOND HOPES FOR HER SHOULD NOT BE REALIZED IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER TO CAST HERSELF INTO THE SEA
HE IS THE DESCENDANT OF A HIGH PERSONAGE AND WAS NOT WITHOUT HOPE OF ELEVATION AT COURT BUT BEING OF AN ECCENTRIC CHARACTER HE WAS STRONGLY AVERSE TO SOCIETY HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A CHIUJIO OF THE IMPERIAL GUARD
SUPPOSING THAT I WERE TO LEAVE HER BEHIND I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HER AS SHE THUS MURMURED HER COUNTENANCE BECAME SADDENED BY HER FOREBODINGS THE SIGHT MOVED GENJI'S SYMPATHY AS HE GAZED
CRIED THE ATTENDANTS IN TONES OF SURPRISE SURELY THE REVEREND FATHER WOULD NOT INDULGE IN FLIRTATIONS WHO CAN THEY BE AND SOME OF THEM EVEN DESCENDED A LITTLE DISTANCE AND PEERED OVER THE ENCLOSURE WHERE A PRETTY LITTLE GIRL WAS ALSO SEEN AMONGST THEM
REMARKED GENJI WHILE HE HIMSELF SECRETLY DESIRED TO BEHOLD HER AY THOUGHT HIS COMPANIONS WITH HIS SUSCEPTIBLE TEMPERAMENT WHAT WONDER IF THIS STORY TOUCHES HIM
THE LITTLE ONE IS HER DAUGHTER AND NO WONDER THAT SHE RESEMBLES THE ONE IN THE PALACE
AT THAT MOMENT A PORTER CAME UP DID YOU GIVE UP YOUR TICKET SIR HE ASKED HERBERT I HADN'T TIME TO GET ONE SAID HERBERT QUITE AT HIS EASE I'LL PAY NOW AND HE BEGAN TO FEEL IN HIS POCKETS THE TRAIN MOVED OUT OF THE STATION
SAYING MY MASTER HAS JUST HEARD OF THE PRINCE'S VISIT TO THE MOUNTAIN AND WOULD HAVE WAITED ON HIM AT ONCE BUT THOUGHT IT BETTER TO POSTPONE CALLING NEVERTHELESS
WOULD THAT I COULD SEE HER MORNING AND EVENING IN THE PALACE WHERE I CAN NO LONGER SEE THE FAIR LOVED ONE WHOM SHE RESEMBLES HE NOW RETURNED TO THE MONASTERY AND RETIRED TO HIS QUARTERS SOON AFTER A DISCIPLE OF THE PRIEST CAME
GENJI WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN THIS CONVERSATION AND THE REST OF THE COMPANY LAUGHINGLY SAID AH SHE IS A WOMAN WHO IS LIKELY TO BECOME THE QUEEN OF THE BLUE MAIN IN VERY TRUTH HER FATHER MUST BE AN EXTRAORDINARY BEING
I E BUDDHIST BIBLE ON HER ARM STOOL PROCEEDED TO READ IT SHE SEEMED TO BE RATHER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OLD HER FACE WAS RATHER ROUND AND HER APPEARANCE WAS NOBLE HER HAIR WAS THROWN BACK FROM HER FOREHEAD
SO GENJI WHOSE MIND WAS OCCUPIED IN THOUGHT COULD NOT SLUMBER HERE THE PRIEST SAID HE WAS GOING TO VESPERS BUT IN REALITY IT WAS LATER THAN THE PROPER TIME FOR THEM GENJI PERCEIVED
BUT SHE IS EXTREMELY YOUNG HOWEVER EVERY WOMAN GROWS UP UNDER THE PROTECTING CARE OF SOME ONE AND SO I CANNOT SAY MUCH ABOUT HER ONLY IT SHALL BE MENTIONED TO MY SISTER
ON THE MOUNTAIN THE CHERRY TREES WERE STILL IN BLOSSOM THEY ADVANCED ON THEIR WAY FURTHER AND FURTHER THE HAZE CLUNG TO THE SURFACE LIKE A SOFT SASH DOES ROUND THE WAIST AND TO GENJI WHO HAD SCARCELY EVER BEEN OUT OF THE CAPITAL
AND NUMEROUS MONASTERIES WERE VISIBLE SCATTERED HERE AND THERE IN THE DISTANCE BENEATH THERE WAS IMMEDIATELY BEYOND THE WINDING PATH IN WHICH THEY WERE WALKING A PICTURESQUE AND PRETTY BUILDING ENCLOSED BY HEDGES ITS WELL ARRANGED BALCONIES AND THE GARDENS AROUND IT
GENJI ACCEPTED THE OFFER THINKING AS HE WENT I WONDER WHAT THE PRIEST HAS SAID AT HOME ABOUT MYSELF TO THOSE TO WHOM I HAVE NOT YET BEEN INTRODUCED BUT IT WILL BE PLEASANT TO SEE THEM ONCE MORE THE NIGHT WAS MOONLESS
SINCE FIRST THAT TENDER GRASS I VIEWED MY HEART NO SOFT REPOSE E'ER FEELS BUT GATHERING MIST MY SLEEVE BEDEWS AND PITY TO MY BOSOM STEALS SURELY YOU SHOULD KNOW SIR
HERE TOO THE HOME OF THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE CONSTITUTES AN OBJECT OF GREAT ATTRACTION
BECAUSE I HAD LEFT MY TICKET ON THE DRESSING TABLE AFTER ALL I GAVE MY LUGGAGE TO A PORTER AND WENT OFF TO THE STATION MASTER I WONDER IF YOU CAN HELP ME I SAID
BUT HAVING RESIGNED THAT OFFICE HAD BECOME GOVERNOR OF HARIMA HE WAS NOT HOWEVER POPULAR IN THAT OFFICE IN THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS HE REFLECTED WITHIN HIMSELF NO DOUBT THAT HIS PRESENCE IN THE CAPITAL COULD NOT BUT BE DISAGREEABLE
HE WAS INVOLUNTARILY TAKEN BY A FANCY THAT HOW HAPPY WOULD HE BE IF ACCOMPANIED TO SUCH A RETREAT BY SUCH A GIRL AS HE HAD SEEN IN THE EVENING AND WITH THIS FANCY HER LOVELY FACE ROSE UP BEFORE HIM SUDDENLY HE SAID TO THE PRIEST
THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT I SAT UP IN BED AND DIRECTED OPERATIONS RIGHT SAID HERBERT NOW WHAT ABOUT YOUR RETURN TICKET YOU MUSTN'T FORGET THAT YOU REMIND ME OF A LITTLE STORY I SAID I'LL TELL IT YOU WHILE YOU PACK THAT WILL BE NICE FOR YOU
ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR FAMILY HISTORY ARE KNOWN TO ME CONTINUED HE LOOK UPON ME I PRAY AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR YOUR ONCE LOVED DAUGHTER I TOO WHEN A MERE INFANT
THUS AS THEY DEPICTED THEM TO HIM THEY CHEERED AND GLADDENED HIS MIND ONE OF THEM WENT ON TO SAY AMONG SUCH SIGHTS AND AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE IS THE SEA COAST OF AKASHI IN THE PROVINCE OF HARIMA WHICH IS I THINK ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL
BUT WE MUST TAKE IT WITH SOME RESERVE SHE MUST BE AFTER ALL A COUNTRY MAIDEN AND ALL THAT I CAN GIVE CREDIT TO IS THIS MUCH THAT HER MOTHER MAY BE A WOMAN OF SOME SENSE WHO TAKES GREAT CARE OF THE GIRL I AM ONLY AFRAID THAT IF ANY FUTURE GOVERNOR
THE CONTOUR OF THE CHILD LIKE FOREHEAD AND OF THE SMALL AND GRACEFUL HEAD WAS VERY PLEASING GENJI AS HE SURVEYED THE SCENE FROM WITHOUT THOUGHT WITHIN HIMSELF IF SHE IS THUS FAIR IN HER GIRLHOOD WHAT WILL SHE BE WHEN SHE IS GROWN UP
THE PRIEST SAID THIS WITH A GRAVE AND EVEN A STERN EXPRESSION ON HIS COUNTENANCE WHICH CAUSED GENJI TO DROP THE SUBJECT HE THEN ASKED THE PRINCE TO EXCUSE HIM FOR IT WAS THE HOUR FOR VESPERS AND AS HE QUITTED THE ROOM TO ATTEND THE SERVICE
A LOOK OF HORROR CAME OVER HERBERT'S FACE I KNEW WHAT IT MEANT HE HADN'T ANY MONEY ON HIM HI HE SHOUTED TO ME AND THEN WE SWUNG ROUND A BEND OUT OF SIGHT WELL WELL HE'LL HAVE TO GET HOME SOMEHOW
BLESS YOU I SAID AS I GOT HAPPILY INTO MY TRAIN YOU'VE SAVED MY LIFE I'VE HAD AN AWFUL TIME I SAY DO YOU KNOW I'VE MET TWO STATION MASTERS ALREADY THIS MORNING WHO'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF YOU YOU MUST ENQUIRE INTO IT
AND MY EMERALD AND DIAMOND TIE PIN THAT WAS THE SORT OF MAN I WAS THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO HE SAID WALKING WITH ME TO THE DOOR IS TO TAKE A TICKET TO PLYMOUTH AND SPEAK TO THE STATION MASTER THERE THIS IS A MOST INTERESTING GAME I SAID BITTERLY
THROUGH THE MOUTH OF A THIRD PERSON ALTHOUGH I THANK THE LADY FOR EVEN THAT MUCH I SHOULD FEEL MORE OBLIGED TO HER IF SHE WOULD GRANT ME AN INTERVIEW AND ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN TO HER MY SINCERE WISHES
APPARENTLY BETOKENED THE GOOD TASTE OF ITS INHABITANTS WHOSE HOUSE MAY THAT BE INQUIRED GENJI OF HIS ATTENDANTS THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS A HOUSE IN WHICH A CERTAIN PRIEST HAD BEEN LIVING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AH I KNOW HIM SAID GENJI
WHEN THEREFORE HIS TERM OF OFFICE EXPIRED HE DETERMINED STILL TO REMAIN IN THE PROVINCE HE DID NOT HOWEVER GO TO THE MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS OF THE INTERIOR BUT CHOSE THE SEA COAST THERE ARE IN THIS DISTRICT
HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND THE TRAP STARTS IN HALF AN HOUR HELP I CRIED AND I LEAPT OUT OF BED HALF AN HOUR LATER I WAS SAYING GOOD BYE TO HERBERT I'VE HAD AN AWFULLY JOLLY TIME I SAID AND I'LL COME AGAIN YOU'VE GOT THE TICKET ALL RIGHT RATHER
YES YES BUT CAN I I'VE ONLY GOT ABOUT ONE POUND SIX
BUT WITH THE CHANGE IN HIS NATURE HE DID NOT FORGET HIS NATIVE HAUNTS ON THE OSAGE BUT IMMEDIATELY BENT HIS WAY IN THAT DIRECTION HE WAS HOWEVER SOON OVERTAKEN BY HUNGER AND FATIGUE WHEN HAPPILY THE GREAT SPIRIT APPEARED
BUT ROSIE PUT HER ARMS ABOUT HER FATHER'S NECK AND LOOKING BESEECHINGLY INTO HIS EYES SAID SHE PREFERRED HER OLD TUTOR
AHMATEAHZA OR MISSOURI WHICH THEY HAD SAID APPROACHED VERY NEAR TO THE COLUMBIA RIVER LEWIS KNEW THAT THE SUCCESS OF HIS EXPEDITION DEPENDED LARGELY UPON CHOOSING THE RIGHT STREAM BECAUSE
THE MEN HE WROTE ARE LOADED AS HEAVILY AS THEIR STRENGTH WILL PERMIT THE CROSSING IS REALLY PAINFUL
THE ORDINARY DUTIES OF LIFE MISTER DALY ANXIOUS TO MAKE SOME RETURN FOR THE KINDNESS SHOWN HIM OFFERED TO ACT AS TUTOR TO ALL THE CHILDREN WHO WERE OLD ENOUGH FOR SCHOOL DUTIES
THE INDIAN'S SKILL IN WOODCRAFT AND WHO ALSO KNEW THE LANGUAGE OF THE WHITE EXPLORERS
AND WHEN THEY MET INDIANS TRIED TO LEARN THE HISTORY AND CUSTOMS OF THE TRIBE CAPTAIN LEWIS WROTE DOWN MANY OF THEIR CURIOUS TRADITIONS
AND BUILT FRONTIER POSTS IN THE WILDERNESS
AS THEY WENT UP THE RIVER THEY FREQUENTLY MET CANOES LOADED WITH FURS COMING DOWN DAY BY DAY THEY TOOK CAREFUL OBSERVATIONS AND MADE MAPS OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELING
THEN WENT ON TO RELATE HOW HE HAD FIRST MET THEIR MOTHER'S MOTHER THEN A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF FIFTEEN AN ACQUAINTANCE TOOK HIM TO CALL UPON A YOUNG LADY FRIEND OF HIS
FOUNDED NEW ORLEANS AND ATTRACTED MANY FRENCH PIONEERS THERE
INDEED ALMOST EVERYTHING IN THE SHAPE OF TOYS THAT THE CHILDISH HEART COULD DESIRE
WHERE THE WATER WAS ONLY BREAST HIGH THIS ADVENTURE TAUGHT THEM THE DANGER OF CROSSING THE SLIPPERY HEIGHTS ABOVE THE STREAM BUT AS THE PLAINS WERE BROKEN BY RAVINES ALMOST AS DIFFICULT TO PASS
HE VOYAGED ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND SAILED DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI TO ITS MOUTH
IN QUICK SUCCESSION IT IS LOUD
THEY HAD TO STOP AND SEARCH FOR A SUBSTITUTE AND FINALLY FOUND WILLOW TREES WHICH PROVIDED THEM WITH ENOUGH WOOD TO PATCH UP THE BOAT CARRIAGE
OF THE WASBASHA OR OSAGES WHO KEPT A REVERENCE FOR THEIR ANCESTORS NEVER HUNTING THE BEAVER BECAUSE IN KILLING THAT ANIMAL THEY WOULD KILL A BROTHER OF THE OSAGE
SOON AFTERWARD THIS SEIGNEUR'S BROTHER
YES INDEED FRANK IS A DEAR GOOD LITTLE BOY AND I LIKE TO HAVE YOU TOGETHER MAMMA UNLOCKED THE DOOR OF A LARGE LIGHT CLOSET AS SHE SPOKE
MOST OF WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DESERTED FOR FIVE OR SIX WEEKS FROM THIS FACT THEY JUDGED THAT THEY WERE FOLLOWING A BAND OF ABOUT
REPOSSESSING HERSELF OF SO MUCH TERRITORY HE SENT ROBERT R LIVINGSTON AND JAMES MONROE TO PARIS TO TRY TO BUY NEW ORLEANS AND THE COUNTRY KNOWN AS THE FLORIDAS
LOUISIANA IN HONOR OF KING
FASTENING THE SKIN OF THE HEAD
NIGHT CLOTHES MORNING WRAPPERS GAY SILKS AND LOVELY WHITE DRESSES
YOU DO WELL TO PRESERVE THEM WITH CARE AS MEMENTOES OF YOUR MOTHER HE REMARKED COMING BACK AND SEATING HIMSELF BY HER SIDE
FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES FROM THE HEAT AND FATIGUE THEY ARE ALL OBLIGED TO HALT AND REST FREQUENTLY AND AT ALMOST EVERY STOPPING PLACE THEY FALL AND MANY OF THEM ARE ASLEEP IN AN INSTANT
IN SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX ROBERT CAVALIER
WE SAW EACH OTHER DAILY I ASKED HER TO BE MY OWN LITTLE WIFE AND SHE CONSENTED
HE MEANT TO COLONIZE AND FORTIFY THIS SPLENDID EMPIRE BUT BEFORE IT COULD BE DONE ENEMIES GATHERED AGAINST HIS EAGLES AT HOME AND TO SAVE HIS EUROPEAN THRONE HE HAD TO FORSAKE HIS WESTERN COLONY
PROTECTED BY SHELVING ROCKS UNDER WHICH THEY COULD TAKE REFUGE
THE SLEEPING MEN WERE IN DANGER FROM THEIR CLAWS A TREMENDOUS STORM ADDED TO THEIR DISCOMFORT AND THE HAILSTONES WERE DRIVEN SO FURIOUSLY BY THE HIGH WIND THAT THEY WOUNDED SOME OF THE MEN
GRANDMA'S THINGS THEY SAID SOFTLY YES THESE ARE WHAT MY DEAR MOTHER PLAYED WITH WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL LIKE ELSIE AND VI SAID MAMMA
THEY PUSHED ON TO CAMP WHERE THE REST OF THE PARTY HAD ALREADY TAKEN SHELTER AND HAD ABANDONED ALL WORK FOR THAT DAY WHILE THE MEN WERE BUILDING A NEW BOAT OF SKINS CAPTAIN LEWIS SPENT
HIS KNIFE IN ONE HAND AND HIS RIFLE IN THE OTHER IN THIS MANNER THE MAN REGAINED A SECURE PLACE ON THE CLIFF CAPTAIN LEWIS CONSIDERED THAT THIS METHOD OF TRAVELING WAS TOO DANGEROUS
ALONG THE MUSSELSHELL THE COUNTRY WAS COVERED WITH WILD ROSES AND SMALL HONEYSUCKLE
NO ONE BEING PRESENT EXCEPT THE MINISTER THE SEXTON AND HER FRIEND AND MINE WHO WERE ENGAGED TO EACH OTHER AND HER FAITHFUL MAMMY HER GUARDIAN WAS AWAY IN A DISTANT CITY AND KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
WE NEVER SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN WHEN I WENT BACK IN THE MORNING THE HOUSE WAS CLOSED AND QUITE DESERTED
AND LEWIS FOUND THAT FOR THREE MILES
AND NAMED THE SITE COUNCIL BLUFFS
BESIDES THESE WERE ANTELOPES BEAVERS BEARS BADGERS DEER AND PORCUPINES AND THE RIVER BANKS SUPPLIED THEM WITH PLOVER GROUSE GEESE TURKEYS DUCKS AND PELICANS
THE MOSQUITOES ANNOYING THE NOONDAY SUN UNCOMFORTABLY HOT AND THE NIGHTS VERY COLD THE MISSOURI RIVER ALONG WHICH THEY WERE STILL TRAVELING WAS NOW HEADING TO THE SOUTHWEST
AND THE CARPENTER BUILT A CARRIAGE TO TRANSPORT THE BOATS
CAPTAIN LEWIS CHRISTENED THE STREAM PORCUPINE RIVER
THEY THEREFORE HID THEIR HEAVIEST BOAT
HALF A MILE FROM THEIR NEW CAMPING PLACE THE CARRIAGE BROKE AGAIN AND THIS TIME THEY FOUND IT EASIER TO CARRY BOAT AND BAGGAGE THAN TO BUILD A NEW CONVEYANCE CAPTAIN LEWIS DESCRIBED
AND GIVING HIM A BOW AND ARROW SHOWED HIM HOW TO KILL AND COOK DEER AND COVER HIMSELF WITH THE SKINS HE THEN PUSHED ON TO HIS HOME BUT AS HE NEARED IT HE WAS MET BY A BEAVER
IN TIME THIS PURCHASE OF LOUISIANA OR THE TERRITORY STRETCHING TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS FORMING THE LARGER PART OF WHAT ARE NOW THIRTEEN OF THE STATES OF THE UNION
YES IT IS FROM HIS KIND HAND ALL OUR BLESSINGS COME
THEY WERE NOW VERY FAR NORTH NEAR THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF WHAT IS THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA GAME WAS STILL PLENTIFUL BUT THE BANKS OF THE RIVER WERE COVERED WITH A COATING OF ALKALI SALTS
AND FRANCE'S CHANCE WAS OVER
THE RIVER THREE HUNDRED YARDS WIDE WAS SHUT IN BY STEEP CLIFFS AND FOR NINETY YARDS FROM THE LEFT CLIFF THE WATER FELL
JEFFERSON AND THE PEOPLE IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES WERE DISMAYED AT THE PRICE PAID FOR WHAT THEY CONSIDERED ALMOST WORTHLESS LAND BUT THE WEST WAS DELIGHTED OWNING THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT MISSISSIPPI AND WITH THE COUNTRY BEYOND IT FREE TO THEM TO EXPLORE
I AM GLAD MY CHILDREN THAT YOU LOVE KNOWLEDGE THEIR MOTHER SAID BECAUSE IT IS USEFUL THE MORE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE THE MORE GOOD WE CAN DO IF WE WILL AND THEN IT IS A LASTING PLEASURE
EDDIE RAN TO OPEN IT AH I THOUGHT I SHOULD FIND YOU HERE DAUGHTER MISTER DINSMORE SAID COMING IN
AND THEY LIVED WELL DURING THE WHOLE OF THE SUMMER
STONES AND OH I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT HERE FROM WHAT WE HAVE AT HOME AT HOME WHY THIS IS HOME ISN'T IT MAMMA EXCLAIMED EDDIE YES MY SON ONE OF OUR HOMES YES AND SO BEAUTIFUL SAID VI
WITHIN FORTY PACES OF THE BEAR FOUR OF THE HUNTERS FIRED AND EACH LODGED A BALL IN THE BEAR'S BODY THE ANIMAL SPRANG UP AND ROARED FURIOUSLY AT THEM AS HE CAME NEAR THEM THE TWO HUNTERS WHO HAD NOT YET FIRED GAVE HIM TWO MORE WOUNDS
EACH MEMBER OF THIS TRIBE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SELECT A PARTICULAR OBJECT FOR HIS DEVOTION AND CALL IT HIS MEDICINE
UPSET THE CANOE THE BOAT WOULD HAVE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BUT FOR THE RESISTANCE OF THE CANVAS AWNING THE OTHER BOATS HASTENED TO THE RESCUE RIGHTED THE CANOE AND BY BALING HER OUT KEPT HER FROM SINKING THEY ROWED THE CANOE TO SHORE AND THE CARGO WAS SAVED
THE EXPLORERS FOUND HOWEVER THAT SINCE THE VALUE OF BEAVER SKINS HAD RISEN IN TRADE WITH THE WHITE MEN THESE INDIANS WERE NOT SO PARTICULAR IN THEIR REVERENCE FOR THEIR RELATIVES
OF STEEP FALLS AND RAPIDS
WHEN THE MISSOURI TURNED SOUTHWARD THE EXPLORERS CAME TO MANY STEEP RAPIDS AROUND WHICH THE CANOES HAD TO BE CARRIED WHICH MADE TRAVELING SLOW
THUS DISGUISED THE INDIAN WOULD TAKE A POSITION BETWEEN A HERD OF BUFFALO AND THE PRECIPICE OVERLOOKING A RIVER THE OTHER HUNTERS WOULD STEAL BACK OF THE HERD AND AT A GIVEN SIGNAL CHASE THEM
GATHERED ABOUT HER FOR A LITTLE CHAT BEFORE RETURNING TO THEIR PLAY MAMMA SAID EDDIE WE'VE HAD A NICE LONG HOLIDAY AND IT'S REALLY PLEASANT TO GET BACK TO LESSONS AGAIN SO IT IS SAID VI DON'T YOU THINK SO ELSIE
ELSIE EXPECTED HER CHILDREN TO FIND IT A LITTLE HARD TO GO BACK TO THE OLD ROUTINE BUT IT WAS NOT SO
WHERE THEY FOUND A LARGE NUMBER OF PORCUPINES FEEDING
ONE EVENING THE MEN IN THE CANOES SAW A LARGE GRIZZLY LYING SOME THREE HUNDRED PACES FROM THE SHORE SIX OF THEM LANDED AND HID
THEY KNEW THAT THE MINNETAREES OF THE MISSOURI OFTEN
DRIVING THEIR LIGHT CANOES OVER THE WATERS OF THE GREAT RIVERS AND OFTEN SHARING THE TENTS OF FRIENDLY INDIANS THEY MET MANY HAD BECOME ALMOST MORE INDIAN THAN WHITE MAN HAD MARRIED INDIAN WIVES AND LIVED THE WANDERING LIFE OF THE NATIVE
IT IS HEARD AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE DAY AND NIGHT LEWIS WROTE
THE PARTY HAD BY THIS TIME THREE INTERPRETERS
THEN BEGGED THEIR MOTHER TO TELL THEM AGAIN ABOUT DEAR GRANDMA THEY HAD HEARD THE STORY ALL THAT MAMMA AND MAMMY COULD TELL MANY TIMES BUT IT NEVER LOST ITS CHARM YES DEARS I WILL I LOVE TO THINK AND SPEAK OF HER ELSIE SAID
WHEN ONE OF THE OTHERS ON SHORE SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD AND FINALLY KILLED HIM THEY DRAGGED HIM TO SHORE AND FOUND THAT EIGHT BALLS HAD GONE THROUGH HIM IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THE HUNTERS TOOK THE BEAR'S SKIN BACK TO CAMP AND THERE THEY LEARNED THAT ANOTHER ADVENTURE HAD OCCURRED
QUANTITIES OF BOOKS GAMES AND TOYS NOTHING SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN THAT COULD GIVE PLEASANT EMPLOYMENT FOR THEIR LEISURE HOURS OR MINISTER TO THEIR AMUSEMENT THERE WAS A BURST OF UNITED EXCLAMATIONS OF WONDERING DELIGHT FROM THE CHILDREN AS THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN AND THEY ENTERED
FOUNDER OF THE NATION WAS A SNAIL WHO LIVED QUIETLY ON THE BANKS OF THE OSAGE UNTIL A HIGH FLOOD SWEPT HIM DOWN TO THE MISSOURI AND LEFT HIM EXPOSED ON THE SHORE THE HEAT OF THE SUN AT LENGTH RIPENED HIM INTO A MAN
NOT NOW DAUGHTER THOUGH PERHAPS I MAY ALLOW IT SOME DAY WHEN YOU ARE OLDER BUT SEE HERE WILL NOT THESE DO QUITE AS WELL
MAMMA I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU AND MY DEAR FATHER
WHO IN THEIR TURN WOULD BE CLOSELY PURSUED BY THE HUNTERS THE WHOLE HERD THEREFORE WOULD USUALLY RUSH OVER THE CLIFF AND THE HUNTERS
OF ORDNANCE AT THE DISTANCE OF THREE MILES THE MINNETAREES FREQUENTLY MENTIONED THIS NOISE LIKE THUNDER
THE OSAGES LIVED IN VILLAGES AND WERE GOOD FARMERS USUALLY PEACEFUL ALTHOUGH NATURALLY STRONG AND TIRELESS CAPTAIN LEWIS FOUND A CURIOUS TRADITION
MISSOURI RIVER NEAR SAINT LOUIS THE NEARER PART OF THIS COUNTRY HAD ALREADY BEEN WELL EXPLORED BY HUNTERS AND TRAPPERS AND ESPECIALLY BY THAT RACE OF ADVENTUROUS FRENCHMEN WHO WERE ROVERS BY NATURE
WHICH MADE THE WATER OF THE STREAMS BITTER AND UNPLEASANT FOR DRINKING OCCASIONALLY THEY CAME UPON A DESERTED INDIAN CAMP BUT IN THIS NORTHERN TERRITORY THEY FOUND FEW ROVING TRIBES WHEN THERE WAS A FAVORABLE WIND THEY SAILED ALONG THE MISSOURI
MEETING SMALL BANDS OF INDIANS AND PASSING ONE OR TWO WIDELY SEPARATED FRONTIER SETTLEMENTS THEY HAD TO PASS MANY DIFFICULT RAPIDS IN THE RIVER BUT AS THEY WERE FOR THE MOST PART EXPERT BOATMEN THEY MET WITH NO MISHAPS
ONE OF WHICH BROKE A SHOULDER BUT BEFORE THEY HAD TIME TO RELOAD THEIR GUNS THE BEAR WAS SO NEAR THEM THAT THEY HAD TO RUN FOR THE RIVER HE ALMOST OVERTOOK THEM TWO JUMPED INTO THE CANOES THE OTHER FOUR SEPARATED
ONLY SEEMED TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION TOWARD THE HUNTERS UNTIL FINALLY HE CHASED TWO OF THEM SO CLOSELY THAT THEY THREW AWAY THEIR GUNS
THE WHIP RATTLES MADE OF THE HOOFS OF GOATS AND DEER
LEANING ON HIS KNEE AND GAZING AFFECTIONATELY INTO HIS FACE I'M GLAD YOU DO HE SAID PATTING HER SOFT ROUND CHEEK
VINES TRAILING OVER AND ABOUT THE WINDOWS LOVELY PICTURES ON THE WALLS COSY CHAIRS AND COUCHES WORK TABLES WELL SUPPLIED WITH ALL THE IMPLEMENTS FOR SEWING OTHERS SUITED FOR DRAWING
MUCH TIME STUDYING THE ANIMALS TREES AND PLANTS OF THE REGION MAKING RECORDS OF THEM TO TAKE HOME
WAS ONE LINE OF RAPIDS AND CASCADES OVERHUNG BY BLUFFS FIVE MILES ABOVE THE FIRST FALLS THE WHOLE RIVER WAS BLOCKED BY ONE STRAIGHT SHELF OF ROCK OVER WHICH THE WATER RAN IN AN EVEN SHEET A MAJESTIC SIGHT
BY THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE WATERMEN
THE REST OF THE RIVER SHOT FORWARD WITH GREATER FORCE AND BEING BROKEN BY PROJECTING ROCKS SENT CLOUDS OF FOAM INTO THE AIR AS THE WATER STRUCK THE BASIN BELOW THE FALLS
THEY SHALL SEE THEM AFTERWARDS I WANT NO ONE BUT MY OWN LITTLE CHILDREN NOW REPLIED MAMMA TAKING HAROLD'S HAND AND LEADING THE WAY SHE LED THEM TO THE ROOM A LARGE AND VERY PLEASANT ONE LIGHT AND AIRY WHERE FLOWERS WERE BLOOMING AND BIRDS SINGING
CAME TO CANADA AND SET OUT FROM HIS SEIGNEURIE NEAR THE RAPIDS OF MONTREAL TO FIND THE LONG SOUGHT ROAD TO CHINA INSTEAD OF DOING THAT HE DISCOVERED THE OHIO RIVER FIRST OF WHITE MEN
COULD NOT KEEP HIS FINGERS FROM NORTH AMERICA HE PLANNED TO WIN BACK THE NEW FRANCE THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN AWAY
HER HUSBAND ALSO CAUGHT AT HER AND PULLED HER ALONG BUT HE WAS SO MUCH FRIGHTENED AT THE NOISE AND DANGER THAT BUT FOR CLARK'S STEADINESS HE WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILD WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN LOST
BUT SHE POOR THING HAD NONE TO LOVE OR CHERISH HER BUT HER MAMMY
MISTER DINSMORE'S VOICE FALTERED HE PAUSED A MOMENT
LEWIS SAW THE DANGER BUT CALMLY TOLD THE OTHER TO TAKE HIS KNIFE FROM HIS BELT WITH HIS RIGHT HAND
THIS METHOD OF HUNTING WAS VERY EXTRAVAGANT BUT AT THAT TIME THE INDIANS HAD NO THOUGHT OF PRESERVING THE BUFFALOES ONE OF THE RIVERS LEWIS PASSED IN THIS REGION HE NAMED THE SLAUGHTER RIVER ON ACCOUNT OF THIS WAY OF HUNTING
AND IF HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO CATCH HIMSELF WITH HIS MOUNTAIN STICK
WITH GREAT PRESENCE OF MIND THE MAN DID THIS AND GETTING A FOOTHOLD RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES
RAIN AND HAIL BEAT UPON THEIR SHELTER
HAD ASCENDED THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS BEYOND THEY SHOULD FIND THAT THE RIVER THEY HAD TAKEN DID NOT BRING THEM NEAR THE COLUMBIA THEY WOULD HAVE TO RETURN AND THEREBY WOULD LOSE A LARGE PART OF THE SUMMER WHICH WAS THE ONLY SEASON WHEN THEY COULD TRAVEL
AS HE REACHED THE EDGE HE WOULD QUICKLY HIDE HIMSELF IN SOME CREVICE
THE INDIANS WERE FRIENDLY AND EACH DAY TAUGHT THE WHITE MEN SOMETHING NEW
CHABONEAU AND HIS INDIAN WIFE AND YOUNG CHILD
O GRANDPA YOU COULD TELL US MORE ABOUT HER AND DEAR MAMMA TOO WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL SAID LITTLE ELSIE SEATING HERSELF UPON HIS KNEE TWINING HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK AND LOOKING COAXINGLY INTO HIS FACE AH WHAT A DEAR LITTLE GIRL YOUR MAMMA WAS AT YOUR AGE HE SAID
WHAT DID YOU THINK THE FIRST MINUTE YOU SAW HER GRANDPA ASKED EDDIE
WHILE THE OTHERS EMBARKED IN SIX CANOES AND TWO LARGE OPEN BOATS THAT THEY HAD BUILT DURING THE WINTER SO FAR
SUPERSTITION OR PERHAPS A FALSEHOOD
SCARCELY ANYTHING WAS KNOWN OF LOUISIANA EXCEPT THE STORIES TOLD BY A FEW HUNTERS JEFFERSON DECIDED THAT THE REGION MUST BE EXPLORED AND ASKED HIS YOUNG SECRETARY MERIWETHER LEWIS
THIS PART OF THE MISSOURI HOWEVER OFFERED GREAT DIFFICULTIES TO THEIR TRAVEL
LITTLE ELSIE SAID DRAWING A DEEP SIGH AS THE TALE CAME TO AN END YES POOR LITTLE GIRL PLAYING UP HERE ALL ALONE SAID EDDIE CEPT MAMMY CORRECTED VI
DOES IT DARLING ASKED MAMMA GIVING HER A SMILE AND A KISS YES MAMMA AND I LOVE ION DEARLY
THOUGH NOT DEARER THAN SHE IS NOW ELSIE RETURNED THE LOVING GLANCE AND SMILE WHILE HER NAMESAKE
AT A DISTANCE
LEWIS CHOSE HIS FRIEND WILLIAM CLARK TO ACCOMPANY HIM AND PICKED THIRTY TWO EXPERIENCED MEN FOR THEIR PARTY MAY FOURTEENTH
BUT AS THEY NOW TURNED WESTWARD THEY CAME INTO A REGION ENTIRELY UNKNOWN
MAMMA HOW PLEASANT THAT WILL BE SAID ELSIE THOUGHTFULLY
SO THEY SHALL MY DARLINGS SHE ANSWERED FOR MAMMA LOVES TO TEACH YOU THE YOUNG CARRINGTONS TOO AND THEIR MOTHER PREFERRED THE OLD WAY SO MISTER DALY'S KIND OFFER WAS DECLINED WITH THANKS
IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE AND
THE BUFFALOES WOULD RUN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DISGUISED BRAVE WHO WOULD LEAD THEM
THE BIRD WOMAN WHO HAD ORIGINALLY BELONGED TO THE SNAKE TRIBE BUT WHO HAD BEEN CAPTURED IN HER CHILDHOOD BY BLACKFEET INDIANS
ON JULY TWENTY FIRST
THEY WERE ABLE TO LEAVE THEIR CAMP AT FORT MANDEN AND START ON AGAIN THE UPPER MISSOURI THEY FOUND WAS TOO SHALLOW FOR THE LARGE BARGE THEY HAD USED THE PREVIOUS SUMMER
AND THAT WAS OUR MAMMA CRIED THE CHILDREN ONCE MORE CROWDING ABOUT HER TO LAVISH CARESSES UPON HER THEY THANKED THEIR GRANDFATHER FOR HIS STORY AND VI LOOKING IN AT THE CLOSET DOOR AGAIN SAID IN HER MOST COAXING TONES MAMMA
CONSISTING OF SEVEN HOUSES WITH AS MANY FAMILIES LOCATED THERE
MEANTIME CLARK STUDIED THE RIVER AND FOUND THAT A SERIES OF RAPIDS MADE A PERILOUS DESCENT AND THAT A PORTAGE OF THIRTEEN MILES WOULD BE NECESSARY
SOON AFTERWARD FRANCE TO OUTWIT ENGLAND GAVE SPAIN NEW ORLEANS AND HER CLAIM
THE OSAGE READILY CONSENTED AND FROM THIS HAPPY MARRIAGE
AH I AM SO GLAD SO THANKFUL THAT MY DARLINGS HAVE NEVER SUFFERED FOR LACK OF LOVE I TOO MAMMA AND I AND I
THE COUNTRY ALONG THIS STREAM WAS BARE FOR SOME DISTANCE WITH GRADUALLY RISING HILLS BEYOND THE GAME HERE WAS VERY PLENTIFUL
HAD THEY WAITED A MINUTE LONGER THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SWEPT INTO THE MISSOURI JUST ABOVE THE GREAT FALLS THEY REACHED THE TOP IN SAFETY AND THERE FOUND YORK
WON'T YOU SHOW THEM TO US YES WE WILL GO NOW ME TOO MAMMA ASKED HAROLD YES ALL OF YOU COME I WANT YOU ALL TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE THAT ONCE BELONGED TO MY DEAR MOTHER AUNT ROSIE WANTS TO SEE THEM TOO SAID VI
AND PERHAPS HE WAS NOT SORRY BEING WEAK AND LANGUID AND IN NO DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM ENNUI WITH HORSES TO RIDE
VALLEY WEST OF THE RIVER TO WHICH THE NAME LOUISIANA NOW CAME TO BE RESTRICTED
A SHORT DISTANCE BEYOND THIS CAPTAIN LEWIS
IN THE NORTH THEY PRESSED WESTWARD AND CAME IN SIGHT OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AT THAT TIME IT SEEMED AS IF FRANCE WAS TO OWN AT LEAST TWO THIRDS OF THE CONTINENT
I WAS LATELY THE OWNER OF SEVENTEEN HORSES BUT I HAVE OFFERED THEM ALL UP TO MY MEDICINE AND AM NOW POOR
AH DAUGHTER I HAD JESUS TO LOVE ME AND HELP ME IN ALL MY CHILDISH GRIEFS AND TROUBLES THE MOTHER ANSWERED WITH A GLAD SMILE AND MAMMY TO HUG AND KISS AND LOVE ME JUST AS SHE DOES YOU
WHILE THEY WERE BUSY MAKING THIS PORTAGE THEY HAD SEVERAL NARROW ESCAPES FROM ATTACKS BY GRIZZLY BEARS
NOW THEY WERE CONTINUALLY COMING UPON NEW RIVERS MANY OF THEM BROAD WITH SWIFT FLOWING CURRENTS AND ALL OF THEM APPEALING TO THE LOVE OF EXPLORATION THE MISSOURI WAS THEIR HIGHROAD HOWEVER AND SO THEY SIMPLY STOPPED TO NAME THE DIFFERENT STREAMS THEY CAME TO
IN THE OPENING SPRING EVEN IN THAT BARE COUNTRY LEWIS FOUND PLACES NEAR THE RIVER FILLED WITH CHOKE CHERRIES YELLOW CURRANTS WILD ROSES AND PRICKLY PEARS IN FULL BLOOM IN THE DISTANCE THE MOUNTAINS
SUCH A MAN CAPTAIN LEWIS FOUND AT THE START OF HIS JOURNEY AND TOOK WITH HIM TO ACT
AND HAD SLIPPED DOWN TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE WHERE HE LAY WITH HIS RIGHT ARM AND LEG OVER THE CLIFF
NUMBERING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED WARRIORS THE LITTLE OSAGES WHO LIVED SOME SIX MILES DISTANT FROM THE OTHERS AND NUMBERED HALF AS MANY MEN
EACH TRIBE DIFFERED IN SOME WAY FROM ITS NEIGHBORS FOR THE FIRST TIME THE EXPLORERS FOUND AMONG THE RICKAREES EIGHT SIDED EARTH COVERED LODGES AND BASKET SHAPED BOATS MADE OF INTERWOVEN BOUGHS COVERED WITH BUFFALO SKINS
YEARS LATER THE ENGLISH GENERAL WOLFE
THEY HAD ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR GENERAL AND WERE WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THE MOST TREMENDOUS LABOURS AND TO ENGAGE IN THE MOST ARDUOUS CONFLICTS TO PLEASE HIM KNOWING THAT HE ON HIS PART
THEIR GENERAL COULD KEEP HIS ARMY TOGETHER IN READINESS TO STRIKE A BLOW WHENEVER AN OPPORTUNITY OFFERED WHILE HANNIBAL ON THE OTHER HAND WAS FORCED TO SCATTER A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE ARMY IN SEARCH OF PROVISIONS
THEY HAD UNDER THEM EIGHT FULL LEGIONS OR EIGHTY THOUSAND INFANTRY AND SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED CAVALRY TO OPPOSE THESE HANNIBAL HAD FORTY THOUSAND INFANTRY AND TEN THOUSAND EXCELLENT CAVALRY OF WHOM TWO THOUSAND WERE NUMIDIANS
ON THE RIGHT BANK OF THE AUFIDUS THE NEXT MORNING EMILIUS WHO WAS IN COMMAND DETACHED A THIRD OF HIS FORCE ACROSS THE RIVER AND ENCAMPED THEM THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING THE ROMAN FORAGING PARTIES ON THAT SIDE AND OF INTERRUPTING THOSE OF THE CARTHAGINIANS
SWEPT ROUND BEHIND THEIR INFANTRY AND FELL UPON THE REAR OF THE ITALIAN HORSE WHILE THE NUMIDIANS CHARGED THEM FIERCELY IN FRONT THUS CAUGHT IN A TRAP THE ITALIAN HORSE WERE COMPLETELY ANNIHILATED AND SO BEFORE THE HEAVY INFANTRY OF THE TWO ARMIES MET EACH OTHER
BURYING HIS KNIFE BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS WITHOUT A SOUND THE MAN FELL FORWARD ON HIS FACE NESSUS COOLLY WIPED HIS KNIFE UPON THE GARMENTS OF THE SPY AND THEN PROCEEDED AT A RAPID PACE UNTIL HE OVERTOOK MALCHUS IT WAS A SPY HE SAID
LET YOUR FOLLOWER COME NIGHTLY TO ME FOR INSTRUCTIONS
BUT THROUGH THE LONG PERIODS OF ENFORCED IDLENESS IN THEIR WINTER QUARTERS FROM FIRST TO LAST THROUGH THE LONG WAR THERE WAS NEITHER GRUMBLING NOR DISCONTENT NOR INSUBORDINATION AMONG THE TROOPS THEY SERVED WILLINGLY AND CHEERFULLY
AND THE TWO AT ONCE SET OUT FOR HIS HOUSE
CLIMBED OUT OF THE HOWDAH AND SLIPPED DOWN BY THE ELEPHANT'S TAIL THE USUAL PLAN FOR DISMOUNTING WHEN AN ELEPHANT IS ON ITS FEET
SOME THREW THEMSELVES ON THEIR FACES OTHERS GOT OVER THE PARAPET AND HUNG BY THEIR HANDS UNTIL HE HAD PASSED WHILE SOME SQUEEZED THEMSELVES AGAINST THE WALL BUT THE ELEPHANT PASSED ON WITHOUT DOING HARM TO ANY
I THINK WE ARE FOLLOWED MY LORD HE SAID ONE OF HANNO'S SPIES IN MANON'S HOUSEHOLD IS NO DOUBT SEEKING TO DISCOVER WHO ARE THE ARABS WHO HAVE PAID HIS MASTER A VISIT
AND HEARD HOW COMPLETELY THE HOSTILE FACTION WERE THE MASTERS OF CARTHAGE HE AGREED THAT THE COUNSELS OF THE OLD NOBLEMAN WERE WISE AND THAT MALCHUS COULD HAVE DONE NO GOOD WHEREAS HE WOULD HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH
THEY TURNED OFF TOGETHER FROM THE MAIN ROAD
WHERE THE VAST MAGAZINES OF THE ROMANS AT ONCE FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE THUS NOT ONLY OBTAINED POSSESSION OF HIS ENEMY'S SUPPLIES BUT INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE ROMANS AND THE LOW LYING DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN APULIA WHERE ALONE AT THIS EARLY SEASON OF THE YEAR
THE ROMAN ARMY WAS AS BEFORE WATCHING HIM AT A SHORT DISTANCE OFF MALCHUS AT ONCE SOUGHT THE TENT OF THE GENERAL WHOSE SURPRISE AT SEEING HIM ENTER WAS GREAT FOR HE HAD NOT EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD RETURN UNTIL THE SPRING
THE ANNUAL ELECTIONS AT ROME HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE AND TERENTIUS VARRO AND EMILIUS PAULUS HAD BEEN CHOSEN CONSULS EMILIUS BELONGED TO THE ARISTOCRATIC PARTY
COMPOSED AS IT WAS OF MEN OF SO MANY NATIONALITIES FOR THE MOST PART ORIGINALLY COMPELLED AGAINST THEIR WILL TO ENTER THE SERVICE OF CARTHAGE MAINTAINED THEIR DISCIPLINE UNSHAKEN NOT ONLY BY THE HARDSHIPS AND SACRIFICES OF THE CAMPAIGNS
A MINUTE LATER NESSUS SAW A DARK FIGURE COME STEALTHILY ALONG HE STOPPED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE ROADS AND STOOD FOR A FEW SECONDS IN HESITATION
OF THE SEVENTY THOUSAND INFANTRY WHICH HAD ADVANCED TO THE FIGHT FORTY THOUSAND HAD FALLEN ON THE FIELD THREE THOUSAND WERE TAKEN PRISONERS SEVEN THOUSAND ESCAPED TO THE SMALL CAMP AND TEN THOUSAND MADE THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER TO THE LARGE CAMP
IN THE MEANTIME YOU MUST FOR A SHORT TIME REMAIN IN CONCEALMENT WHILE I ARRANGE FOR A SHIP TO CARRY YOU BACK TO ITALY
RECEIVED HIM MOST WARMLY AND LISTENED IN ASTONISHMENT TO HIS STORY OF WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM MALCHUS THEN EXPLAINED THE MISSION WITH WHICH HANNIBAL HAD CHARGED HIM AND ASKED HIS ADVICE AS TO THE BEST COURSE TO BE ADOPTED MANON WAS SILENT FOR A TIME
BUT REMAINED ON BOARD UNTIL THE VESSEL SAILED AS HE FEARED THAT HE MIGHT AGAIN BE RECOGNIZED BY SOME OF THE SAILORS OF THE CARTHAGINIAN VESSELS IN PORT THE WEATHER WAS FAIR AND THE WIND LIGHT AND ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER SAILING
WILL YOU STOP HERE WITH ME OR WILL YOU RETURN TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE STAYING I NEED NOT SAY HOW GLADLY I WOULD HAVE YOU HERE BUT I CANNOT ANSWER CERTAINLY FOR YOUR SAFETY EVERY MOVEMENT OF THOSE BELONGING TO OUR PARTY IS WATCHED BY HANNO
FIGHTING WITH EXTREME OBSTINACY THE CARTHAGINIAN CENTRE WAS FORCED GRADUALLY BACK UNTIL THEY WERE AGAIN IN A LINE WITH THE AFRICANS ON THEIR FLANKS THE ROMANS HAD INSENSIBLY PRESSED IN FROM BOTH FLANKS UPON THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD MET WITH RESISTANCE
THE GREAT ROMAN MAGAZINE OF APULIA WAS AT CANNAE A TOWN NEAR THE RIVER AULIDUS THIS IMPORTANT PLACE WAS BUT FIFTY MILES BY THE SHORTEST ROUTE ACROSS THE PLAIN FROM GERONIUM BUT THE ROMANS WERE UNABLE TO FOLLOW DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PLAIN
AS FIGHTING MEN BELONGING TO ONE OF THE LATIN TRIBES THEN HE MADE INQUIRIES ON THE QUAY AND FINDING THAT A SMALL ITALIAN CRAFT WAS TO START THAT AFTERNOON FOR BRUNDUSIUM HE WENT ON BOARD AND ACCOSTED THE CAPTAIN
STILL FURTHER THE GAULS AND SPANIARDS WERE DRIVEN BACK UNTIL THEY NOW FORMED AN ANGLE IN REAR OF THE ORIGINAL LINE AND IN THIS ANGLE THE WHOLE OF THE ROMAN INFANTRY IN A CONFUSED MASS PRESSED UPON THEM THIS WAS THE MOMENT FOR WHICH HANNIBAL HAD WAITED
SWEPT CLOUDS OF DUST OVER THEIR HEADS FULL INTO THE FACES OF THE ENEMY THE BATTLE WAS COMMENCED BY THE LIGHT TROOPS ON BOTH SIDES WHO FOUGHT FOR SOME TIME OBSTINATELY AND COURAGEOUSLY BUT WITHOUT ANY ADVANTAGE TO EITHER
WAS UNWEARIED IN PROMOTING THEIR COMFORT AND WELL BEING AT ALL OTHER TIMES AS THE SPRING ADVANCED THE GREAT MAGAZINES WHICH HANNIBAL HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM BECAME NEARLY EXHAUSTED AND NO PROVISIONS COULD BE OBTAINED FROM THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY
BUT CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH FURTHER STRENGTHENING HIS CAMPS HANNIBAL SEEING THAT THE ROMANS WOULD NOT FIGHT DETACHED HIS NUMIDIAN CAVALRY ACROSS THE RIVER TO CUT OFF THE ROMAN FORAGING PARTIES AND TO SURROUND AND HARASS THEIR SMALLER CAMP ON THAT SIDE OF THE RIVER
LEAPED INTO A GARDEN AND HID HIMSELF AMONG SOME BUSHES THE MAHOUT NOW TURNED THE ELEPHANT AND
SHE SEES UNMOVED THE HEROIC EFFORTS WHICH HANNIBAL AND HIS ARMY ARE MAKING TO SAVE HER AND SHE WILL NOT STRETCH OUT A HAND TO AID HIM SHE LIVES CONTENTEDLY UNDER THE CONSTANT TYRANNY OF HANNO'S RULE
AT THE SAME TIME HE LAUNCHED HIS HEAVY CAVALRY AGAINST THE ROMAN HORSE THE LATTER WERE INSTANTLY OVERTHROWN AND WERE DRIVEN FROM THE FIELD WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER EMILIUS HIMSELF WAS WOUNDED BUT MANAGED TO JOIN THE INFANTRY
AS A READINESS TO PAY AN EXORBITANT PRICE MIGHT HAVE GIVEN RISE TO DOUBTS IN THE CAPTAIN'S MIND AS TO THE QUALITY OF HIS PASSENGERS ONCE OR TWICE HE MADE AS IF HE WOULD GO ASHORE AND THE CAPTAIN AT LAST ABATED HIS DEMANDS TO A REASONABLE SUM WHEN THIS WAS SETTLED
BUT HE WILL CARRY NO MORE TALES TO HANNO TWO DAYS LATER NESSUS ON HIS RETURN FROM HIS VISIT TO MANON BROUGHT NEWS THAT THE LATTER HAD ARRANGED WITH THE CAPTAIN OF A SHIP OWNED BY A FRIEND TO CARRY THEM ACROSS TO CORINTH
NOT A ROMAN CAVALRY SOLDIER REMAINED ALIVE AND UNWOUNDED ON THE FIELD THE ROMAN INFANTRY NOW ADVANCED TO THE CHARGE AND FROM THE NATURE OF HANNIBAL'S FORMATION THEIR CENTRE FIRST CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE HEAD OF THE SALIENT ANGLE
THE CORN WAS FULLY RIPE THE ROMANS HAD NOW NO CHOICE BUT TO ADVANCE AND FIGHT A BATTLE FOR THE RECOVERY OF THEIR MAGAZINES FOR HAD THEY RETIRED THE APULIANS WHO HAD ALREADY SUFFERED TERRIBLY FROM THE WAR
WHILE HANNIBAL COULD VICTUAL HIS ARMY FROM THE COUNTRY BEHIND HIM THE SENATE THEREFORE HAVING LARGELY REINFORCED THE ARMY ORDERED THE CONSULS TO ADVANCE AND GIVE BATTLE
I WILL COME DOWN AND SEE HIM HIS VISITS WERE THEY KNOWN WOULD EXCITE SUSPICION BID HIM ON HIS RETURN WATCH CLOSELY TO SEE THAT HE IS NOT FOLLOWED AND TELL HIM TO GO BY DEVIOUS WINDINGS AND TO MIX IN THE THICKEST CROWDS
IF THE MAN BEHIND US BE HONEST HE WILL GO STRAIGHT ON IF HE BE A SPY HE WILL HESITATE AND STOP AT THE CORNER TO DECIDE WHICH OF US HE SHALL FOLLOW THEN I SHALL KNOW WHAT TO DO
WHERE NOTHING WAS LEFT UNDONE WHICH COULD ADD TO THE COMFORT AND CONTENTMENT OF THE TROOPS THERE IS NO STRONGER EVIDENCE OF THE POPULARITY OF HANNIBAL AND OF THE INFLUENCE WHICH HE EXERCISED OVER HIS TROOPS THAN THE FACT THAT THE ARMY UNDER HIM
WHERE IF THE LIFE IS ROUGH IT IS AT LEAST FREE AND INDEPENDENT WHERE COURAGE AND MANLINESS AND HONOUR COUNT FOR MUCH AND WHERE THE ENERVATING INFLUENCE OF WEALTH IS AS YET UNKNOWN SUCH IS MY FIRM RESOLUTION
ACCORDINGLY AT THE NEXT CROSSROAD THEY CAME TO NESSUS TURNED DOWN AND CONCEALED HIMSELF A FEW PACES AWAY
ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER LEAVING THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF GERONIUM THE ROMANS ENCAMPED AT A DISTANCE OF SIX MILES FROM THE CARTHAGINIANS HERE THE USUAL DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AT ONCE AROSE BETWEEN THE ROMAN CONSULS WHO COMMANDED THE ARMY ON ALTERNATE DAYS
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY VARRO WHOSE TURN IT WAS TO COMMAND MARCHED TOWARDS THE HOSTILE CAMP HANNIBAL ATTACKED THE ROMAN ADVANCED GUARD WITH HIS CAVALRY AND LIGHT INFANTRY BUT VARRO HAD SUPPORTED HIS CAVALRY NOT ONLY BY HIS LIGHT TROOPS
IN ORDER TO THROW ANY ONE WHO MAY BE FOLLOWING OFF HIS TRACK BEFORE HE REJOINS YOU I TRUST TO BE ABLE TO ARRANGE FOR A SHIP IN THE COURSE OF THREE OR FOUR DAYS COME AGAIN AND SEE ME BEFORE YOU LEAVE HERE IS A BAG OF GOLD YOU WILL NEED IT TO REWARD THOSE WHO HAVE ASSISTED IN YOUR ESCAPE
FORMED BY THE GAULS AND SPANIARDS THESE RESISTED WITH GREAT OBSTINACY THE PRINCIPES WHO FORMED THE SECOND LINE OF THE ROMAN INFANTRY CAME FORWARD AND JOINED THE SPEARMEN AND EVEN THE TRIARII PRESSED FORWARD AND JOINED IN THE FIGHT
AT A SPOT NEAR THE PORT THEY FOUND ONE OF THE ARABS FROM ABOVE AWAITING THEM AND HE AT ONCE LED THE WAY TO THE HOUSE INHABITED BY HIS FAMILY THE SCHEME HAD BEEN ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL
WHILE THIS CONTEST WAS GOING ON HANNIBAL ADVANCED HIS CENTRE SO AS TO FORM A SALIENT ANGLE PROJECTING IN FRONT OF HIS LINE THE WHOLE OF THE GAULS AND SPANIARDS TOOK PART IN THIS MOVEMENT WHILE THE AFRICANS REMAINED STATIONARY
FOR CARTHAGE WITH ITS HIDEOUS TYRANNY ITS FOUL CORRUPTION ITS FORGETFULNESS OF ITS GLORY ITS HONOUR AND EVEN ITS SAFETY IS UTTERLY HATEFUL TO ME I TRUST THAT NEVER AGAIN SHALL I SET FOOT WITHIN ITS WALLS
FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED STRONG WAS ON THE LEFT WING FACING THE NUMIDIANS EMILIUS COMMANDED THE ROMAN RIGHT VARRO THE LEFT THE CARTHAGINIANS FACED NORTH SO THAT THE WIND WHICH WAS BLOWING STRONGLY FROM THE SOUTH
SUCH ARE THE NATURAL SENTIMENTS OF YOUR AGE AND METHINKS WERE MY OWN TIME TO COME OVER AGAIN I TOO WOULD CHOOSE SUCH A LIFE IN PREFERENCE TO AN EXISTENCE IN THE POLLUTED ATMOSPHERE OF UNGRATEFUL CARTHAGE AND NOW
WHILE THE CARTHAGINIAN HEAVY HORSE WERE THUS DEFEATING THE ROMAN CAVALRY THE NUMIDIANS MANEUVERED NEAR THE GREATLY SUPERIOR CAVALRY OF THE ITALIAN ALLIES AND KEPT THEM OCCUPIED UNTIL THE HEAVY HORSE AFTER DESTROYING THE ROMAN CAVALRY
LISTENING TO EVERY SOUND AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE ANCHOR WAS WEIGHED THE SAILS HOISTED AND THE VESSEL BEGAN TO DRAW AWAY FROM CARTHAGE THAT HE WENT INTO HIS CABIN ON THE SIXTH DAY AFTER LEAVING CARTHAGE THE SHIP ENTERED THE PORT OF CORINTH
AND FORMED IT IN ORDER OF BATTLE LEAVING EIGHT THOUSAND OF HIS MEN TO GUARD HIS CAMP BY THUS DOING HE OBTAINED A POSITION WHICH HE COULD THE BETTER HOLD WITH HIS INFERIOR FORCES WHILE THE ROMANS DEEMING THAT HE INTENDED TO ATTACK THEIR CAMP ON THAT SIDE OF THE RIVER
BY ENDEAVOURING FURTHER TO CARRY OUT THE MISSION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN CHARGED MANON KNOWS WHAT IS BEST AND NO DOUBT A PREMATURE ATTEMPT TO EXCITE THE POPULACE TO FORCE HANNO INTO SENDING THE REINFORCEMENTS WE SO MUCH NEED WOULD HAVE NOT ONLY FAILED
AND ACROSS THIS HANNIBAL HAD DRAWN UP HIS ARMY WITH BOTH WINGS RESTING UPON THE RIVER THUS THE ROMANS COULD NOT OUTFLANK HIM AND THE EFFECT OF THEIR VASTLY SUPERIOR NUMBERS IN INFANTRY WOULD TO SOME EXTENT BE NEUTRALIZED
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY HE HAD PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH THE GARMENTS OF A TRADER THE CHARACTER WHICH HE WAS NOW ABOUT TO ASSUME AT MIDNIGHT WHEN ALL WAS QUIET HE AND NESSUS SET OUT AND MADE THEIR WAY DOWN TO THE PORT WHERE
FOR AT THIS TIME THE CARTHAGINIANS GREATLY OUTNUMBERED THEM IN CAVALRY AND THEY WOULD THEREFORE HAVE TO TAKE THE ROAD ROUND THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS WHICH WAS NEARLY SEVENTY MILES LONG AND YET BY SOME UNACCOUNTABLE BLUNDER
AND AVOIDING THE BUSY STREETS OF THE TOWN DIRECTED ITS COURSE TOWARDS THE MORE QUIET ROADS OF THE OPULENT QUARTER OF MEGARA THE CRIES OF THE PEOPLE AT THE APPROACH OF THE ELEPHANT PRECEDED ITS COURSE AND ALL TOOK REFUGE IN GARDENS OR HOUSES
NESSUS AND THE ARAB AT ONCE RETURNED TO THE CITADEL IT WAS AGREED THAT THE FORMER HAD BETTER CONTINUE HIS WORK AS USUAL UNTIL THE EVENING
WHILE ANOTHER PRAETOR LUCIUS POSTUMIUS WITH ONE LEGION WAS IN CISALPINE GAUL KEEPING DOWN THE TRIBES FRIENDLY TO CARTHAGE BUT BEFORE THE NEW CONSULS ARRIVED TO TAKE THE COMMAND OF THE ARMY HANNIBAL HAD MOVED FROM GERONIUM
WE WANT TO CROSS TO ITALY HE SAID BUT WE HAVE OUR REASONS FOR NOT WISHING TO LAND AT BRUNDUSIUM AND WOULD FAIN BE PUT ASHORE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN WE ARE READY OF COURSE TO PAY EXTRA FOR THE TROUBLE THE REQUEST DID NOT SEEM STRANGE TO THE CAPTAIN
AT A LITTLE FREQUENTED LANDING STAGE A BOAT WAS AWAITING THEM AND THEY WERE AT ONCE ROWED TO THE SHIP WHICH WAS LYING AT ANCHOR HALF A MILE FROM THE SHORE IN READINESS FOR AN EARLY START IN THE MORNING ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN TRACED
WHICH HAD BEEN COMPLETELY RUINED BY THE LONG PRESENCE OF THE TWO ARMIES IT BECAME THEREFORE NECESSARY TO MOVE FROM THE POSITION WHICH HE HAD OCCUPIED DURING THE WINTER THE ROMANS POSSESSED THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF HAVING MAGAZINES IN THEIR REAR
AND HAD GIVEN PROOF OF MILITARY ABILITY THREE YEARS BEFORE WHEN HE HAD COMMANDED AS CONSUL IN THE ILLYRIAN WAR VARRO BELONGED TO THE POPULAR PARTY
AND THE EVENTS WHICH HAD OCCURRED SINCE HIS LANDING AT CARTHAGE AND ASKING HIM TO RECEIVE HIM PRIVATELY IN TWO HOURS TIME IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT CONSULT HIM AS TO THE BEST PLAN TO BE FOLLOWED NESSUS RETURNED SAYING THAT MANON WAS AT HOME AND WAS AWAITING HIM
CONSTANTLY REPLENISHED BY THEIR ALLIES AND MOVE WHERE THEY MIGHT THEY WERE SURE OF OBTAINING SUBSISTENCE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THUS UPON THE MARCH THEY WERE UNEMBARRASSED BY THE NECESSITY OF TAKING A GREAT BAGGAGE TRAIN WITH THEM AND WHEN HALTED
HE WHEELED ROUND BOTH HIS FLANKS AND THE AFRICANS WHO HAD HITHERTO NOT STRUCK A BLOW NOW FELL IN PERFECT ORDER UPON THE FLANKS OF THE ROMAN MASS WHILE HASDRUBAL WITH HIS VICTORIOUS CAVALRY CHARGED DOWN LIKE A TORRENT UPON THEIR REAR
WOULD IN SHEER DESPAIR HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DECLARE FOR CARTHAGE
EIGHT THOUSAND STRONG WHILE THE TWO THOUSAND NUMIDIANS WERE POSTED BETWEEN THE INFANTRY AND THE RIVER ON THE RIGHT FLANK HANNIBAL COMMANDED THE CENTRE OF THE ARMY IN PERSON HANNO THE RIGHT WING HASDRUBAL THE LEFT WING MAHARBAL COMMANDED THE CAVALRY
AND IN HIS ARAB GARB HE COULD NOW TRAVERSE THE STREETS UNSUSPECTED NESSUS WAS OVERJOYED AT THE SUCCESS OF THE STRATAGEM AND MALCHUS HIMSELF COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT HE HAD ESCAPED FROM THE TERRIBLE DANGER WHICH THREATENED HIM
THE FOLLOWING WAS THE DISPOSITION OF HIS TROOPS THE SPANIARDS AND GAULS OCCUPIED THE CENTRE OF THE LINE OF INFANTRY THE AFRICANS FORMED THE TWO WINGS ON HIS LEFT FLANK BETWEEN THE AFRICANS AND THE RIVER HE PLACED HIS HEAVY AFRICAN AND GAULISH HORSE
TO INTRODUCE YOU SUDDENLY TO THE SENATE AS HANNIBAL'S AMBASSADOR TO THEM AND LEAVE YOU TO PLEAD HIS CAUSE YOU WOULD OBTAIN NO HEARING HANNO WOULD RISE IN HIS PLACE AND DENOUNCE YOU AS ONE ALREADY CONDEMNED BY THE TRIBUNALS AS AN ENEMY TO THE REPUBLIC
SLOWLY RETRACED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE CITADEL A MINUTE OR TWO LATER MALCHUS ISSUED OUT AND QUIETLY FOLLOWED IT HE HAD GONE SOME DISTANCE WHEN HE SAW AN ARAB APPROACHING HIM AND SOON RECOGNIZED NESSUS
BUT WOULD HAVE INJURED OUR CAUSE HE AND HIS FRIENDS WILL DOUBTLESS WORK QUIETLY TO PREPARE THE PUBLIC MIND AND I TRUST THAT ERE VERY LONG SOME DECISIVE VICTORY WILL GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EXCITING A GREAT DEMONSTRATION ON OUR BEHALF
PAID A FAREWELL VISIT TO MANON AND REPEATED TO HIM ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS OF HANNIBAL AND MANON HANDED HIM HIS LETTER FOR THE GENERAL AND AGAIN ASSURED HIM THAT HE WOULD WITH HIS FRIENDS AT ONCE SET TO WORK TO PAVE THE WAY FOR AN APPEAL TO THE POPULACE AT THE FIRST FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY
THE LATTER BECAME LESS AND LESS FREQUENT UNTIL AT A DISTANCE OF TWO MILES FROM THE FOOT OF THE CITADEL THE MAHOUT ON LOOKING ROUND PERCEIVED NO ONE IN SIGHT HE BROUGHT THE ELEPHANT SUDDENLY TO A STANDSTILL QUICK MY LORD
THEY NEGLECTED TO PLACE A SUFFICIENT GUARD OVER THEIR GREAT MAGAZINES AT CANNAE TO DEFEND THEM FOR EVEN A FEW DAYS AGAINST A SUDDEN ATTACK HANNIBAL SAW THE OPPORTUNITY AND WHEN SPRING WAS PASSING INTO SUMMER
MANON SAID FOR THE YOUNG BLOOD RUNS HOTLY IN YOUR VEINS AND YOUR RAGE AT SEEING THE FATE WHICH IS TOO CERTAINLY IMPENDING OVER CARTHAGE AND WHICH YOU ARE POWERLESS TO PREVENT IS IN NO WAY TO BE BLAMED
VARRO WISHED TO MARCH AGAINST THE ENEMY WITHOUT DELAY WHILE EMILIUS WAS ADVERSE TO RISKING AN ENGAGEMENT IN A COUNTRY WHICH BEING LEVEL AND OPEN WAS FAVOURABLE TO THE ACTION OF HANNIBAL'S SUPERIOR CAVALRY
SUCH IS IN MY OPINION THE ONLY POSSIBLE MODE OF PROCEEDING TO MOVE NOW WOULD BE TO ENSURE A REJECTION OF OUR DEMANDS TO BRING FRESH PERSECUTIONS UPON US AND SO TO WEAKEN US THAT WE SHOULD BE POWERLESS TO TURN TO GOOD ACCOUNT
MALCHUS GAVE HIM AN ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE SINCE HE LEFT HIM HANNIBAL WAS INDIGNANT IN THE EXTREME AT HANNO HAVING VENTURED TO ARREST AND CONDEMN HIS AMBASSADOR WHEN HE LEARNED THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW WITH MANON
THE NEXT DAY PASSED QUIETLY BUT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HANNIBAL QUITTED HIS CAMP AND FORMED HIS ARMY IN ORDER OF BATTLE TO TEMPT THE ROMANS TO ATTACK BUT EMILIUS SENSIBLE THAT THE GROUND WAS AGAINST HIM WOULD NOT MOVE
AND THANKING MANON FOR HIS KINDNESS HE RETURNED WITH NESSUS WHO HAD BEEN WAITING WITHOUT AS THEY WALKED ALONG MALCHUS BRIEFLY RELATED TO HIS FOLLOWER THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS INTERVIEW WITH MANON SUDDENLY NESSUS STOPPED AND LISTENED AND THEN RESUMED HIS WALK
BUT BY A STRONG BODY OF HIS HEAVY ARMED INFANTRY AND AFTER AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH LASTED FOR SEVERAL HOURS HE REPULSED THE CARTHAGINIANS WITH CONSIDERABLE LOSS THAT EVENING THE ROMAN ARMY ENCAMPED ABOUT THREE MILES FROM CANNAE
THE LANGUAGE WITH WHICH ALL WHO TRADED ON THE MEDITERRANEAN WERE FAMILIAR HE SUPPOSED THAT THEY HAD IN SOME WAY EMBROILED THEMSELVES WITH THE AUTHORITIES AT BRUNDUSIUM AND HAD FLED FOR AWHILE UNTIL THE MATTER BLEW OVER
WHENCE THEY WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN TAKING A PASSAGE TO ITALY THEY WERE TO GO ON BOARD LATE THE FOLLOWING NIGHT AND THE SHIP WOULD SET SAIL AT DAYBREAK
AND WOULD DEMAND YOUR INSTANT EXECUTION AND AS HE HAS A GREAT MAJORITY OF VOTES IN THE SENATE HIS DEMAND WOULD BE COMPLIED WITH YOU WOULD I AM CONVINCED THROW AWAY YOUR LIFE FOR NO GOOD PURPOSE WHILE YOUR PRESENCE AND YOUR MYSTERIOUS ESCAPE FROM PRISON
AS A COARSE AND BRUTAL DEMAGOGUE THE SON OF A BUTCHER AND HAVING HIMSELF BEEN A BUTCHER BUT HE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY AN ABLE MAN AND POSSESSED SOME GREAT QUALITIES THE PRAETOR MARCELLUS
WOULD BE LIKELY TO MOVE THEIR WHOLE ARMY ACROSS AND TO GIVE BATTLE THIS IN FACT VARRO PROCEEDED TO DO LEAVING TEN THOUSAND MEN IN HIS OWN CAMP WITH ORDERS TO MARCH OUT AND ATTACK THAT OF HANNIBAL DURING THE ENGAGEMENT HE LED THE REST OF HIS TROOPS OVER THE RIVER
WHERE THEY JOINED THE FORCE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT THERE AND WHICH HAD IN OBEDIENCE TO VARRO'S ORDERS ATTACKED THE CARTHAGINIAN CAMP BUT HAD BEEN REPULSED WITH A LOSS OF TWO THOUSAND MEN ALL THE TROOPS IN BOTH CAMPS WERE FORCED TO SURRENDER ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
HE ASKED RATHER A HIGH PRICE FOR PUTTING THEM ASHORE IN A BOAT AS THEY WISHED
WOULD BE MADE THE PRETENSE FOR A FRESH SERIES OF PERSECUTIONS OF OUR PARTISANS I UNDERSTAND AS WELL AS YOU DO THE URGENCY FOR REINFORCEMENTS BEING SENT TO ITALY BUT IN ORDER TO DO THIS THE NAVY NOW ROTTING IN OUR HARBOURS MUST BE REPAIRED
THEN FOLLOWED A SLAUGHTER UNEQUALLED IN THE RECORDS OF HISTORY UNABLE TO OPEN OUT TO FIGHT OR TO FLY WITH NO QUARTER ASKED OR GIVEN THE ROMANS AND THEIR LATIN ALLIES FELL BEFORE THE SWORDS OF THEIR ENEMIES TILL
WE OLD MEN BOW MORE RESIGNEDLY TO THE DECREES OF THE GODS YOU KNOW THE SAYING THOSE WHOM THE GODS WOULD DESTROY THEY FIRST STRIKE WITH MADNESS CARTHAGE IS SUCH
AND I DOUBT NOT THAT HE HAS HIS SPIES AMONG MY SLAVES AND SERVANTS
SATISFIED TO BE WEALTHY LUXURIOUS AND SLOTHFUL TO CARRY ON HER TRADE TO KEEP HER RICHES CARING NOTHING FOR THE MANLY VIRTUES INDIFFERENT TO VALOUR PREPARING HERSELF SLOWLY AND SURELY TO FALL AN EASY PREY TO ROME
AND HANNO AND HIS PARTY HAVE LAVISHED MONEY SO FREELY AMONG THE LOWER CLASSES THAT THERE IS NO HOPE OF STIRRING THE POPULACE UP TO DECLARE AGAINST HIM I THINK IT WOULD BE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE DANGEROUS WERE WE AS YOU PROPOSE
VARRO PLACED HIS INFANTRY IN CLOSE AND HEAVY ORDER SO AS TO REDUCE THEIR FRONT TO THAT OF THE CARTHAGINIANS THE ROMAN CAVALRY NUMBERING TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MEN WAS ON HIS RIGHT WING AND WAS THUS OPPOSED TO HANNIBAL'S HEAVY CAVALRY EIGHT THOUSAND STRONG
WILL SET OUR AGENTS TO WORK AMONG THE PEOPLE AND WHEN THE NEWS OF ANOTHER VICTORY ARRIVES AND THE PEOPLE'S HOPES ARE AROUSED AND EXCITED WE WILL STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT AND CALL UPON THEM TO MAKE ONE GREAT EFFORT TO BRING THE STRUGGLE TO A CONCLUSION AND TO FINISH WITH ROME FOREVER
THE END PROBABLY WILL NOT COME IN MY TIME IT MAY COME IN YOURS BUT COME IT CERTAINLY AND SURELY WILL A NATION WHICH CAN PLACE A MERE HANDFUL OF ITS OWN CITIZENS IN THE LINE OF BATTLE VOLUNTARILY DOOMS HERSELF TO DESTRUCTION
THE COMMAND OF THE SEA MUST BE REGAINED AND FRESH LEVIES OF TROOPS MADE TO ASK CARTHAGE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES IN HER PRESENT MOOD IS HOPELESS WE MUST AWAIT AN OPPORTUNITY I AND MY FRIENDS WILL PREPARE THE WAY
HE EXCLAIMED NOW IS THE TIME
THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH THE NEWS OF ANOTHER GREAT VICTORY WOULD AFFORD I WILL WRITE AT ONCE TO HANNIBAL AND EXPLAIN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SITUATION AND WILL TELL HIM WHY I HAVE COUNSELLED YOU TO AVOID CARRYING OUT HIS INSTRUCTIONS
I WILL BE NO SHARER IN THE FATE OF CARTHAGE I HAVE DONE WITH HER AND IF I DO NOT FALL IN THE BATTLEFIELD I WILL
THEY HAD BEFORE EMBARKING LAID IN A STORE OF PROVISIONS NOT ONLY FOR A VOYAGE BUT FOR THEIR JOURNEY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS THE SLIGHT KNOWLEDGE WHICH MALCHUS HAD OF THE LATIN TONGUE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIM AT ONCE WERE HE OBLIGED TO ENTER A TOWN OR VILLAGE TO PURCHASE FOOD
NESSUS ISSUED FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND WITH STEPS AS SILENT AND STEALTHY AS THOSE OF A TIGER TRACKING HIS PREY FOLLOWED THE MAN WHEN WITHIN A FEW PACES OF HIM HE GAVE A SUDDEN SPRING AND FLUNG HIMSELF UPON HIM
THERE WERE SEVERAL VESSELS THERE FROM ITALIAN PORTS BUT BEFORE PROCEEDING TO ARRANGE FOR A PASSAGE MALCHUS WENT TO A SHOP AND BOUGHT FOR HIMSELF AND NESSUS SUCH CLOTHING AND ARMS AS WOULD ENABLE THEM TO PASS WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
HANNO'S FACTION IS ALL POWERFUL AT PRESENT HE SAID AND WERE HANNIBAL HIMSELF HERE I DOUBT WHETHER HIS VOICE COULD STIR THE SENATE INTO TAKING ACTION SUCH AS IS NEEDED THE TIMES HAVE BEEN HARD
THE REMAINDER OF THE WINTER PASSED QUIETLY MALCHUS RESUMED HIS POST AS THE COMMANDER OF HANNIBAL'S BODYGUARD BUT HIS DUTIES WERE VERY LIGHT THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME WAS SPENT IN ACCOMPANYING HANNIBAL IN HIS VISITS TO THE CAMPS OF THE SOLDIERS
CARRYING THE PROVISIONS IN BUNDLES THEY MADE FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND AFTER THREE DAYS JOURNEY REACHED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR ADVENTURE THE CAMP OF HANNIBAL HE WAS STILL LYING IN HIS INTRENCHED CAMP NEAR GERONIUM
AND HAVING UNITED HIS FORCE WITH THAT IN THE CAMP ON THE RIGHT BANK MARCHED DOWN THE RIVER UNTIL HE FACED THE POSITION WHICH HANNIBAL HAD TAKEN UP THIS HAD BEEN SKILLFULLY CHOSEN THE RIVER WHOSE GENERAL COURSE WAS EAST AND WEST MADE A LOOP
PERFECT IN WISDOM STRENGTH AND EVERYTHING OF WHOM PAUL SAYS THAT HE IS NOT WORSHIPPED WITH MEN'S HANDS AS THOUGH HE NEEDED ANYTHING I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT YOU ARE FIGHTING MERELY WITH A WORD
THE NATIONS NOT SO BLEST AS THEE MUST IN THEIR TURN TO TYRANTS FALL WHILST THOU SHALT FLOURISH GREAT AND FREE THE DREAD AND ENVY OF THEM ALL STILL MORE MAJESTIC SHALT THOU RISE MORE DREADFUL FROM EACH FOREIGN STROKE
WOULD YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY DIVINE SERVICE FOR I THINK YOU MUST USE THE PHRASE IN SOME DIFFERENT SENSE FROM WHAT I HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO AH I OUGHT TO REMEMBER SAID POLWARTH THAT WHAT HAS GROWN FAMILIAR TO MY MIND FROM MUCH SOLITARY THINKING
IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN BADLY OFF WHEN THE TERRIBLE FIFTIES CAME IF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE HAD NOT PLAYED WITH HER DOLLS READ ON AND SEE FOR YOURSELVES FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE LOVED HER DOLLS DEARLY
AT WHICH MORE TRUTH MIGHT ENTER IN THE PRESENT CASE UNUSUAL AS IT IS FOR SO MANY AS THREE TRUTH LOVING MEN TO COME THUS TOGETHER ON THE FACE OF THIS PLANET HERE WERE THREE SIMPLY SET ON UTTERING TRUTH THEY HAD SEEN AND GAINING SIGHT OF TRUTH AS YET VEILED FROM THEM
WHAT IS THE MATTER ROGER HE ASKED KINDLY WHERE IS YOUR DOG THE BOYS HAVE BEEN THROWING STONES AT HIM SIR REPLIED THE OLD MAN THEY HAVE BROKEN HIS LEG POOR BEAST AND HE WILL NEVER BE GOOD FOR ANYTHING AGAIN
WHEN I USE THE PHRASE DIVINE SERVICE I MEAN NOTHING WHATEVER BELONGING TO THE CHURCH OR ITS OBSERVANCES I MEAN BY IT WHAT IT OUGHT TO MEAN THE SERVING OF GOD THE DOING OF SOMETHING FOR GOD
IS THE SABLE WARRIOR FLED THY SON IS GONE HE RESTS AMONG THE DEAD THE SWARM THAT IN THY NOON TIDE BEAM WERE BORN GONE TO SALUTE THE RISING MORN FAIR LAUGHS THE MORN AND SOFT THE ZEPHYR BLOWS
MAY NOT AT ONCE SHOW ITSELF TO ANOTHER WHEN PRESENTED IN THE FORMS OF A FOREIGN INDIVIDUALITY
THEY ARE GREAT ROUNDED HILLS COVERED WITH CLOSE THICK TURF LIKE A VELVET CARPET THEY SPREAD IN LONG SMOOTH GREEN BILLOWS MILES AND MILES OF THEM
AND THRO THE KINDRED SQUADRONS MOW THEIR WAY YE TOWERS OF JULIUS LONDON'S LASTING SHAME WITH MANY A FOUL AND MIDNIGHT MURDER FED REVERE HIS CONSORT'S FAITH HIS FATHER'S FAME AND SPARE THE MEEK USURPER'S HOLY HEAD
THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST THAT FOUGHT AYE THE FOREMOST THE PRIME OF OUR LAND ARE CAULD IN THE CLAY WE'LL HEAR
THE SHEEP WERE SCATTERED IN TWOS AND THREES STRAYING HITHER AND THITHER AND OLD ROGER ALONE WAS TRYING TO COLLECT THEM AND APPARENTLY HAVING A HARD TIME OF IT THE VICAR SAW HIS TROUBLE AND RODE UP TO HIM
THE DOLL MIGHT FEEL VERY MUCH BETTER THE NEXT DAY AND THINK IT WAS TIME TO GET UP AND PUT ON THE NEW FROCK AGAIN BUT SHE WAS VERY APT TO HAVE A RELAPSE AND GO BACK TO BED AND GRUEL AGAIN
CLOSE BY THE REGAL CHAIR FELL THIRST AND FAMINE SCOWL A BALEFUL SMILE UPON THEIR BAFFLED GUEST HEARD YE THE DIN OF BATTLE BRAY LANCE TO LANCE AND HORSE TO HORSE LONG YEARS OF HAVOCK URGE THEIR DESTINED COURSE
BUT I WILL NOT JUDGE THAT IS FOR THE GOD ENLIGHTENED CONSCIENCE OF THE MAN HIMSELF TO DO NOT FOR HIS NEIGHBOUR'S WHY SHOULD I BE JUDGED BY ANOTHER MAN'S CONSCIENCE BUT YOU SEE MISTER DREW AND THIS IS WHAT I WAS DRIVING AT THAT YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO SERVE GOD
THE ASPIRATION THE IMAGINATION OF THE MAN WHEN THE MAN THROWS WIDE HIS DOOR TO THE FATHER OF HIS SPIRIT WHEN HIS INDIVIDUAL BEING IS THUS SUPPLEMENTED TO USE A POOR MISERABLE WORD WITH THE INDIVIDUALITY THAT ORIGINATED IT
LITTLE FLORENCE ALL THE BOYS AND VERY LIKELY SOME OF THE GIRLS WHO HAVE GOT AS FAR AS THIS SECOND CHAPTER WILL GLANCE DOWN THE PAGE AND EXCLAIM DOLLS THEN THEY WILL ADD WHATEVER IS THEIR FAVORITE EXPRESSION OF SCORN
AMAZEMENT IN HIS VAN WITH FLIGHT COMBINED AND SORROW'S FADED FORM AND SOLITUDE BEHIND MIGHTY VICTOR MIGHTY LORD LOW ON HIS FUNERAL COUCH HE LIES NO PITYING HEART NO EYE AFFORD A TEAR TO GRACE HIS OBSEQUIES
ABOVE BELOW THE ROSE OF SNOW TWINED WITH HER BLUSHING FOE WE SPREAD THE BRISTLED BOAR IN INFANT GORE WALLOWS BENEATH THE THORNY SHADE
HER WHOLE BEARING NOW AS ALWAYS WAS THAT OF ONE WHO PERFECTLY TRUSTED A SUPREME SPIRIT UNDER WHOSE INFLUENCES LAY EVEN THE RUGGED MATERIAL OF HER DEFORMED DWELLING POLWARTH ALLOWED WINGFOLD TO HELP HIM IN GETTING TEA
NO DOUBT IT IS TO MANY AMERICAN CHILDREN ALSO YET IT IS ONE THAT NO ONE CAN EVER TIRE OF HEARING SO I SHALL TELL IT AGAIN
AND DAMMING BACK THE TIDE OF THE DAWN FROM HIS DISEASED AND TORMENTED SOUL LITTLE CONVERSATION WAS THEREFORE POSSIBLE
THEY ENTERED AND THERE LAY CAP ON THE BRICK FLOOR HELPLESS AND WEAK BUT STILL BARKING AS HARD AS HE COULD AT WHAT HE SUPPOSED TO BE INTRUDERS WHEN HE SAW FLORENCE AND THE LITTLE BOY HE STOPPED BARKING AND WAGGED HIS TAIL FEEBLY
BECAUSE I WANT TO BE NEAR YOU FATHER IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY COME NEARER STILL COME TO MY BOSOM MY CHILD AND BE YET HAPPIER TALK NOT OF PUBLIC WORSHIP AS DIVINE SERVICE IT IS A MOCKERY
I SHALL ATTEMPT ONLY A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF THE RESULT OF THEIR EVENING'S INTERCOURSE PARTLY RECORDING THE UTTERANCES OF POLWARTH
I MUST LIVE I CANNOT GIVE MY GOODS AWAY MURMURED MISTER DREW THINKINGLY AS ONE THAT SOUGHT ENLIGHTENMENT THAT WOULD BE TO GO DIRECT AGAINST THE ORDER OF HIS WORLD SAID POLWARTH NO A HARDER TASK IS YOURS MISTER DREW
AND STUDIED REGULARLY AND HAD MUSIC AND DRAWING LESSONS BESIDES AND HER FATHER TAUGHT HER TO LOVE ENGLISH LITERATURE AND LATER OPENED TO HER THE GREAT DOORS MARKED LATIN AND GREEK
FOR MONY A HEART THOU HAST MADE SAIR THAT NE'ER DID WRONG TO THINE OR THEE R BURNS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX LAMENT FOR FLODDEN
FOND IMPIOUS MAN THINK'ST THOU YON SANGUINE CLOUD RAISED BY THY BREATH HAS QUENCH'D THE ORB OF DAY TO MORROW HE REPAIRS THE GOLDEN FLOOD AND WARMS THE NATIONS WITH REDOUBLED RAY
THEN WILL HE FORGIVE AND ENDURE AND POUR OUT HIS SOUL FOR THE BELOVED WHO YET GROPE THEIR WAY IN DOUBT AND PASSION THEN EVERY MAN WILL BE DEAR AND PRECIOUS TO HIM EVEN THE WORST FOR IN HIM ALSO LIES AN UNKNOWN YEARNING AFTER THE SAME PEACE WHEREIN HE RESTS AND LOVES
BEST PUT HIM OUT OF HIS PAIN I SAYS NO NO CRIED FLORENCE NOT TILL WE HAVE TRIED TO HELP HIM WHERE IS HE
THERE WERE MANY SHEEP ON THE DOWNS AND THERE WAS ONE SPECIAL FLOCK THAT FLORENCE KNEW VERY WELL IT BELONGED TO OLD ROGER A SHEPHERD WHO HAD OFTEN WORKED FOR HER FATHER ROGER AND HIS GOOD DOG CAP WERE BOTH FRIENDS OF FLORENCE'S
NOR IS IT HARD TO DISCOVER HOW FOR GOD IS IN EVERY CREATURE THAT HE HAS MADE AND IN THEIR NEEDS HE IS NEEDY AND IN ALL THEIR AFFLICTIONS HE IS AFFLICTED THEREFORE JESUS SAYS THAT WHATEVER IS DONE TO ONE OF HIS LITTLE ONES IS DONE TO HIM
BUT I CANNOT GET A HOLD OF YOUR REMARKS ONE MOMENT I THINK I HAVE GOT THE END OF THE CLEW
SHALL I BE SUCH A DULL MULE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LIVING TRUTH OR TO USE A HOMELY SIMILE SHALL I BE AS THE GOOD BOY OF THE NURSERY RHYME WHO SEATED IN HIS CORNER OF SELFISH COMPLACENCY REGARDS THE EATING OF HIS PIE AS A VIRTUOUS ACTION
AND MORE PLEASE HORSE LANGUAGE IS A SIMPLE ONE COMPARED TO ENGLISH AND HAS NO GRAMMAR WELL ONE DAY FLORENCE WAS RIDING HER PONY IN COMPANY WITH HER FRIEND THE VICAR THIS GOOD MAN LOVED ALL LIVING CREATURES
THEN HE CRAWLED FROM UNDER THE TABLE WHERE HE LAY DRAGGED HIMSELF TO FLORENCE'S FEET AND LOOKED UP PITIFULLY IN HER FACE SHE KNELT DOWN BY HIM AND SOOTHED AND PETTED AND TALKED TO HIM WHILE THE GOOD CLERGYMAN EXAMINED THE INJURED LEG
TO THEE BELONGS THE RURAL REIGN THY CITIES SHALL WITH COMMERCE SHINE ALL THINE SHALL BE THE SUBJECT MAIN AND EVERY SHORE IT CIRCLES THINE THE MUSES STILL WITH FREEDOM FOUND SHALL TO THY HAPPY COAST REPAIR
ONCE AT LEAST BEFORE SHE WAS ALLOWED TO RECOVER ENTIRELY THE TRUTH IS FLORENCE WAS BORN TO BE A NURSE AND A SICK DOLL WAS DEARER TO HER THAN A STRONG AND HEALTHY ONE SO I FEAR HER DOLLS WOULD HAVE BEEN INVALIDS MOST OF THE TIME
THROUGH THE NEEDS OF HIS CHILDREN ALL THE WORKING DAY FROM MORNING TO NIGHT SO LONG AS THERE IS A CUSTOMER IN YOUR SHOP I DO THINK YOU ARE RIGHT SIR SAID THE LINEN DRAPER I HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE SAME THING THE OTHER NIGHT MYSELF
BY FAIRY HANDS THEIR KNELL IS RUNG BY FORMS UNSEEN THEIR DIRGE IS SUNG THERE HONOUR COMES A PILGRIM GRAY TO BLESS THE TURF THAT WRAPS THEIR CLAY AND FREEDOM SHALL AWHILE REPAIR
ENJOYS THE CONTEMPLATION OF IT AND THINKS WHAT A PLEASANT OBJECT HE THUS MAKES OF HIMSELF TO HIS PARENTS SHALL I TO TAKE A STEP FARTHER DEGRADE THE SANCTITY OF THE CLOSET HALLOWED IN THE WORDS OF JESUS
ROBED IN THE SABLE GARB OF WOE WITH HAGGARD EYES THE POET STOOD LOOSE HIS BEARD AND HOARY HAIR STREAM'D LIKE A METEOR TO THE TROUBLED AIR AND WITH A MASTER'S HAND AND PROPHET'S FIRE STRUCK THE DEEP SORROWS OF HIS LYRE

AS THE LOUD BLAST THAT TEARS THE SKIES SERVES BUT TO ROOT THY NATIVE OAK THEE HAUGHTY TYRANTS NE'ER SHALL TAME ALL THEIR ATTEMPTS TO BEND THEE DOWN WILL BUT AROUSE THY GENEROUS FLAME AND WORK THEIR WOE AND THY RENOWN
THE NEXT DAY THE CURATE CALLED AGAIN ON LEOPOLD BUT HELEN HAPPENED TO BE OTHERWISE ENGAGED FOR A FEW MINUTES AND MISSUS RAMSHORN TO BE IN THE SICK ROOM WHEN THE SERVANT BROUGHT HIS NAME WITH HER JEALOUSY OF WINGFOLD'S TEACHING SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED HIM
HER MOTHER MEANTIME TAUGHT HER ALL KINDS OF HANDIWORK AND BEFORE SHE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD SHE COULD HEMSTITCH AND SEAM AND EMBROIDER THESE THINGS WERE ALL GOOD AND VERY GOOD WITHOUT THEM SHE COULD NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED ALL SHE DID
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR PARTHENOPE'S LITTLE FAMILY WHO OFTEN REQUIRED THEIR AUNT FLORENCE'S CARE THESE DOLLS WERE VERY UNLUCKY OR ELSE THEIR MAMMA WAS VERY CARELESS YOU CAN CALL IT WHICHEVER YOU LIKE
RULE BRITTANIA BRITTANIA RULES THE WAVES
ALL THE OTHER LEARNING WAS GOING TO HELP THAT WONDERFUL LEARNING THAT BEGAN WITH NURSING THE SICK DOLLS SOON SHE WAS TO TAKE ANOTHER STEP IN HER PROFESSION
YE UNBORN AGES CROWD NOT ON MY SOUL NO MORE OUR LONG LOST ARTHUR WE BEWAIL ALL HAIL YE GENUINE KINGS BRITANNIA'S ISSUE HAIL GIRT WITH MANY A BARON BOLD SUBLIME THEIR STARRY FRONTS THEY REAR
WHETHER IT MAY BE REACHED IN THIS WORLD OR NOT THAT IS A QUESTION OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHETHER A MAN HAS BEGUN TO REACH AFTER IT IS OF THE UTMOST AWFULNESS OF IMPORT
AND YET IT SEEMS AS IF YOU SPOKE OF A PURELY IDEAL STATE ONE THAT COULD NOT BE REALISED IN THIS WORLD PURELY IDEAL OR NOT ONE THING IS CERTAIN IT WILL NEVER BE REACHED BY ONE WHO IS SO INDIFFERENT TO IT AS TO BELIEVE IT IMPOSSIBLE
WHILE THE OLD MAN LAMENTED FLORENCE WAS LOOKING EAGERLY IN THE FACE OF THE CLERGYMAN HE MET HER LOOK WITH A SMILE AND NOD WE WILL GO AND SEE HE SAID AND OFF THEY RODE LEAVING ROGER SHAKING HIS HEAD AND CALLING TO THE SHEEP
YE DIED AMIDST YOUR DYING COUNTRY'S CRIES NO MORE I WEEP THEY DO NOT SLEEP ON YONDER CLIFFS A GRIESLY BAND I SEE THEM SIT THEY LINGER YET AVENGERS OF THEIR NATIVE LAND
ENOUGH FOR ME WITH JOY I SEE THE DIFFERENT DOOM OUR FATES ASSIGN BE THINE DESPAIR AND SCEPTRED CARE TO TRIUMPH AND TO DIE ARE MINE HE SPOKE AND HEADLONG FROM THE MOUNTAIN'S HEIGHT DEEP IN THE ROARING TIDE HE PLUNGED TO ENDLESS NIGHT
THE SLOPES SO GENTLE THAT IT IS DELIGHTFUL TO DRIVE OR RIDE ON THEM ONLY YOU MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO GO NEAR THE EDGE WHERE THE GREEN BREAKS OFF SUDDENLY AND A WHITE CHALK CLIFF GOES DOWN DOWN HUNDREDS OF FEET
FOR THERE I LOST MY FATHER DEAR MY FATHER DEAR AND BRETHREN THREE THEIR WINDING SHEET THE BLUIDY CLAY THEIR GRAVES ARE GROWING GREEN TO SEE AND BY THEM LIES THE DEAREST LAD THAT EVER BLEST A WOMAN'S EE

TO MAKE YOUR BUSINESS A GAIN TO YOU AND AT THE SAME TIME TO BE NOT ONLY WHAT IS COMMONLY COUNTED JUST BUT INTERESTED IN AND CAREFUL OF AND CARING FOR YOUR NEIGHBOUR AS A SERVANT OF THE GOD OF BOUNTY WHO GIVETH TO ALL MEN LIBERALLY
FAR FAR ALOOF THE AFFRIGHTED RAVENS SAIL THE FAMISH'D EAGLE SCREAMS AND PASSES BY DEAR LOST COMPANIONS OF MY TUNEFUL ART DEAR AS THE LIGHT THAT VISITS THESE SAD EYES DEAR AS THE RUDDY DROPS THAT WARM MY HEART
MARK THE YEAR AND MARK THE NIGHT WHEN SEVERN SHALL RE ECHO WITH AFFRIGHT THE SHRIEKS OF DEATH THRO BERKLEY'S ROOF THAT RING SHRIEKS OF AN AGONISING KING
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A CHILD WHO SAID I AM VERY USEFUL TO MY FATHER FOR WHEN I ASK HIM FOR ANYTHING OR TELL HIM I LOVE HIM IT GIVES HIM OH SUCH PLEASURE I SHOULD SAY HE WAS AN UNENDURABLE PRIG BETTER HE HAD TO BE WHIPPED FOR STEALING SAID THE CURATE
FLORENCE CAME AGAIN THE NEXT DAY TO BANDAGE THE LEG
YOUR COUNTER IS OR OUGHT TO BE HIS ALTAR AND EVERYTHING THEREON LAID WITH INTENT OF DOING AS WELL AS YOU CAN FOR YOUR NEIGHBOUR IN THE NAME OF THE MAN CHRIST JESUS IS A TRUE SACRIFICE OFFERED TO HIM
I SHALL HAVE TO TAKE A BIT OF CORD AND PUT AN END TO HIS MISERY OH CRIED FLORENCE WHO HAD RIDDEN UP WITH THE VICAR POOR CAP ARE YOU SURE HIS LEG IS BROKEN ROGER YES MISS IT'S BROKE SURE ENOUGH
I'VE HEARD THEM LILTING AT OUR EWE MILKING LASSES A LILTING BEFORE DAWN O DAY BUT NOW THEY ARE MOANING ON ILKA GREEN LOANING THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST ARE A WEDE AWAY
YOUR CALLING IS TO DO THE BEST FOR YOUR NEIGHBOUR THAT YOU REASONABLY CAN BUT WHO IS TO FIX WHAT IS REASONABLE ASKED DREW THE MAN HIMSELF THINKING IN THE PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST THERE IS A HOLY MODERATION WHICH IS OF GOD
AND TOOK THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CARE OF THEM AND YET THEY WERE ALWAYS DELICATE AND GIVEN TO SUDDEN AND ALARMING ILLNESSES A DOLL NEVER KNEW WHEN SHE MIGHT BE TOLD THAT SHE WAS VERY ILL AND UNDRESSED AND PUT TO BED
IN YON BRIGHT TRACK THAT FIRES THE WESTERN SKIES THEY MELT THEY VANISH FROM MY EYES BUT O WHAT SOLEMN SCENES ON SNOWDON'S HEIGHT DESCENDING SLOW THEIR GLITTERING SKIRTS UNROLL VISIONS OF GLORY SPARE MY ACHING SIGHT
AND SHALL THE MOMENT OF MY DEEPEST REPOSE AND BLISS THE MOMENT WHEN I SERVE MYSELF WITH THE VERY LIFE OF THE UNIVERSE BE CALLED A SERVING OF MY GOD IT IS COMMUNION WITH GOD HE HOLDS IT WITH ME ELSE NEVER COULD I HOLD IT WITH HIM I AM AS THE FOAM FROTH UPON HIS INFINITE OCEAN
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THE BARD PINDARIC ODE RUIN SEIZE THEE RUTHLESS KING CONFUSION ON THY BANNERS WAIT THO FANN'D BY CONQUEST'S CRIMSON WING
IS IT BROKEN ASKED FLORENCE ANXIOUSLY NO SAID THE VICAR NO BONES ARE BROKEN THERE'S NO REASON WHY CAP SHOULD NOT RECOVER ALL HE NEEDS IS CARE AND NURSING FLORENCE QUIETLY LAID DOWN HER RIDING WHIP AND TUCKED UP HER SLEEVES

T GRAY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR
AS I SAID FLORENCE AND THE VICAR WERE RIDING ALONG ON THE GREEN DOWNS AND HERE I MUST STOP AGAIN A MOMENT TO TELL YOU WHAT THE DOWNS ARE FOR WHEN I WAS A CHILD I USED TO WONDER
THERE WOULD BE MORE HOPE OF HIS FUTURE RETURNED POLWARTH IS THE CHILD HE CONTINUED WHO SITS BY HIS FATHER'S KNEE AND LOOKS UP INTO HIS FATHER'S FACE SERVING THAT FATHER BECAUSE THE HEART OF THE FATHER DELIGHTS TO LOOK DOWN UPON HIS CHILD
SO IT WAS THAT UNCONSCIOUSLY AND IN PLAY FLORENCE BEGAN HER TRAINING FOR HER LIFE WORK SHE WAS HAVING LESSONS OF COURSE ARITHMETIC AND ALL THE OTHER PROPER THINGS
FOR WHENEVER SHE SAW FLORENCE AT THE GATE SHE WOULD TOSS HER HEAD AND WHINNY AND COME TROTTING UP TO THE GATE GOOD MORNING PEGGY FLORENCE WOULD SAY WOULD YOU LIKE AN APPLE
BRAVE URIEN SLEEPS UPON HIS CRAGGY BED MOUNTAINS YE MOURN IN VAIN MODRED WHOSE MAGIC SONG MADE HUGE PLINLIMMON BOW HIS CLOUD TOPT HEAD ON DREARY ARVON'S SHORE THEY LIE SMEAR'D WITH GORE AND GHASTLY PALE
IT WAS DREADFULLY SWOLLEN AND EVERY TOUCH WAS PAINFUL BUT CAP KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THE HANDS THAT HURT WERE TRYING TO HELP HIM AND THOUGH HE MOANED AND WINCED HE LICKED THE HANDS AND MADE NO EFFORT TO DRAW THE LEG AWAY
SHALL I MAKE OF THE CHURCH IN MY FOOLISH IMAGINATIONS A TEMPLE OF IDOLATROUS WORSHIP BY SUPPOSING THAT IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF SUPPLYING SOME NEED THAT GOD HAS OR OF GRATIFYING SOME TASTE IN HIM THAT I THERE LISTEN TO HIS WORD SAY PRAYERS TO HIM AND SING HIS PRAISES
WHO COULD TELL WHAT ABSURD AND EXTRAVAGANT IDEAS HE MIGHT NOT PUT INTO THE BOY'S HEAD HE MIGHT MAKE HIM TURN MONK OR SOCINIAN OR LATTER DAY SAINT FOR WHAT SHE KNEW SO SHE SAT BLOCKING UP THE SOLE SMALL WINDOW IN THE YOUTH'S DARK DWELLING THAT LOOKED EASTWARD
THE LITTLE FINGERS GROWN SO SKILLFUL BY BANDAGING WAXEN AND CHINA ARMS AND LEGS WERE NOW TO SAVE A LIVING LOVING CREATURE FROM DEATH TO EVERY ENGLISH CHILD THIS STORY IS A NURSERY TALE
EDWARD LO TO SUDDEN FATE WEAVE WE THE WOOF THE THREAD IS SPUN HALF OF THY HEART WE CONSECRATE THE WEB IS WOVE THE WORK IS DONE
HARK HOW EACH GIANT OAK AND DESERT CAVE SIGHS TO THE TORRENT'S AWFUL VOICE BENEATH

STAY O STAY NOR THUS FORLORN LEAVE ME UNBLESS'D UNPITIED HERE TO MOURN
IN BUSKIN'D MEASURES MOVE PALE GRIEF AND PLEASING PAIN WITH HORROR TYRANT OF THE THROBBING BREAST A VOICE AS OF THE CHERUB CHOIR GALES FROM BLOOMING EDEN BEAR
THEY WERE ALWAYS TUMBLING DOWN AND BREAKING THEIR HEADS OR LOSING ARMS AND LEGS OR BURNING THEMSELVES AT THE NURSERY FIRE OR SUFFERING FROM DOLL'S CONSUMPTION THAT DREADFUL COMPLAINT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS LOSS OF SAWDUST
BUT THERE WERE FEW DEARER TO HIM THAN FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE THEY HAD THE SAME TASTES AND FEELINGS BOTH LOVED TO HELP AND COMFORT ALL WHO WERE IN TROUBLE SORROW NEED SICKNESS OR ANY OTHER ADVERSITY
POOR CAP'S DAYS IS OVER AH HE WERE A GOOD DOG DO EVERYTHING BUT SPEAK HE COULD AND WENT AS NEAR TO THAT AS A DUMB BEAST COULD I'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER LIKE HIM
