THE BARON A VERY PIOUS OLD MAN PRACTISED THAT FINE THEOLOGICAL VIRTUE WHICH WE USED TO CULTIVATE AT BLOIS HOPE
ONLY A SIMPLE COUNTRY HOUSE STANDING BENEATH ONE OF OUR HILLS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THAT NOBLE VALLEY THE PRIDE OF WHICH IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE CASTLE OF MAUCOMBE THE BUILDING IS QUITE UNPRETENTIOUS FOUR PEBBLE WALLS COVERED WITH A YELLOWISH WASH
AND INVEST HER WITH AN EXHAUSTLESS POWER A REDUNDANCY OF LIFE THAT MAKES EVERYTHING BLOSSOM AROUND HER THE MORE SHE IS MISTRESS OF HERSELF THE MORE CERTAINLY WILL THE LOVE AND HAPPINESS SHE CREATES BE FIT TO WEATHER THE STORMS OF LIFE
RETAINING PERFECT INDEPENDENCE WHAT COULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE MORE HONORABLE A CONTRACT OF THIS KIND DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE LEGAL CONTRACT AND EVEN TO THE SACRAMENT ITSELF COULD BE CONCLUDED ONLY BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME
FOR HIS COQUETTISH WHITE STONE HOUSE WITH ITS BLUE ROOF GLITTERING IN THE SUN THE GARDEN AND SURROUNDING WALKS ARE HORRIBLY DUSTY AND THE TREES SEEM BURNT UP
YOUR FAVORS TO ME HOWEVER SLIGHT WILL ALWAYS MAKE MY HAPPINESS IN THE FAR DISTANT FUTURE AS NOW FOR I AM SENSIBLE HOW MUCH DIGNITY THERE IS IN OUR PROMISE TO RESPECT EACH OTHER'S LIBERTY
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GIRL AND A MARRIED WOMAN IS SO VAST THAT THE GIRL CAN NO MORE COMPREHEND IT THAN THE MARRIED WOMAN CAN GO BACK TO GIRLHOOD AGAIN
WHOSE WORDS THRILLED ME AND ON WHOSE ARM I LEANT WITH PLEASURE BEYOND WORDS IN SHORT TO BE OPEN WITH YOU AS I WOULD BE WITH GOD BEFORE WHOM CONCEALMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE THE PERFECT LOYALTY WITH WHICH HE HAD KEPT HIS OATH MAY HAVE PIQUED ME
LIFE GIVES US BUT ONE FRIEND AND I WISH TO BE YOURS FRIENDSHIP IS THE BOND BETWEEN A PAIR OF KINDRED SOULS UNITED IN THEIR STRENGTH AND YET INDEPENDENT LET US BE FRIENDS AND COMRADES TO BEAR JOINTLY THE BURDEN OF LIFE
YET LOUIS IS LOVABLE HIS TEMPER IS WONDERFULLY EVEN AND HE PERFORMS AS A MATTER OF COURSE ACTS ON WHICH MOST MEN WOULD PLUME THEMSELVES IN SHORT IF I DO NOT LOVE HIM I SHALL FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN BEING GOOD TO HIM
I DREW HIM ASIDE IN THE MOST NATURAL MANNER ON SOLITARY WALKS DURING WHICH I DISCREETLY SOUNDED HIS FEELINGS I MADE HIM TALK AND GOT HIM TO EXPOUND TO ME HIS IDEAS AND PLANS FOR OUR FUTURE MY QUESTIONS BETRAYED SO MANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
WHEN YOU ARE MARRIED YOU WILL APPROVE THIS RESERVE ENOUGH THAT NOTHING WAS LACKING EITHER OF SATISFACTION FOR THE MOST FASTIDIOUS SENTIMENT OR OF THAT UNEXPECTEDNESS WHICH BRINGS IN A SENSE ITS OWN SANCTION
I FOUND MY ROOM ALMOST EXACTLY AS I LEFT IT
DO NOT FANCY I CONCLUDED THAT I ASK THIS FROM ANY WISH TO BE ECCENTRIC IT IS THE GREAT DESIRE I HAVE FOR YOUR RESPECT WHICH PROMPTS MY REQUEST IF YOU OWE THE CROWN OF YOUR LOVE MERELY TO THE LEGAL AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONY
WHY SHOULD WE NOT BOTH BE LAUGHING AND GAY IN YOUR PARIS WHENCE I SHALL CARRY YOU OFF NOW AND AGAIN TO MY BEAUTIFUL OASIS IN PROVENCE OH LOUISE DON'T SPOIL THE SPLENDID FUTURE WHICH AWAITS US BOTH DON'T DO THE MAD THINGS WITH WHICH YOU THREATEN ME
WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN IN PERFECT TRUST AND MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF GIVING VARIETY TO THE INFINITE THIS IS THE TASK SET BEFORE EVERY TRUE WIFE THE ANSWER BEGINS TO DAWN ON ME AND I SHALL NOT REST TILL I HAVE MADE IT MINE
SO YOU MUST NARRATE TO ME IN FULL ALL YOUR ADVENTURES DESCRIBE YOUR BALLS AND PARTIES TELL ME WHAT YOU WEAR WHAT FLOWERS CROWN YOUR LOVELY GOLDEN LOCKS AND WHAT ARE THE WORDS AND MANNERS OF THE MEN YOU MEET
YOU ARE SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL RENEE AND YOUR BEAUTY IS OF THE STATUESQUE AND REGAL TYPE ON WHICH TIME LEAVES BUT LITTLE IMPRESSION NO DOUBT THE LOVE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE DEPENDS LESS ON OUTWARD BEAUTY THAN ON GRACES OF CHARACTER
LEAVE ME ABSOLUTELY FREE I WOULD PUT NO HINDRANCE IN THE WAY OF YOUR INSPIRING ME WITH A LOVE SIMILAR TO YOUR OWN BUT I AM DETERMINED TO BE YOURS ONLY OF MY OWN FREE GIFT CREATE IN ME THE WISH TO GIVE UP MY FREEDOM
HIS FINE BLUE EYES ARE CAVERNOUS HE IS A LITTLE DEAF WHICH SUGGESTS THE KNIGHT OF THE SORROWFUL COUNTENANCE
NOT COUNTING HOUSE AND LANDS QUITE A CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE IN PROVENCE HIS WORTHY FATHER HAD BOUGHT ON THE VERY EVE OF THE CHEVALIER'S RETURN A FINE BUT BADLY MANAGED ESTATE WHERE HE DESIGNS TO PLANT TEN THOUSAND MULBERRY TREES
MARRIAGE SOON BECOMES INTOLERABLE UNLESS THE WOMAN IS THE PRESIDING SPIRIT A WOMAN IN SUCH A CASE NEEDS THE CHARM OF A MISTRESS COMBINED WITH THE SOLID QUALITIES OF A WIFE
SHALL BE ALWAYS GREEN I SHALL CARRY MY PARK UP THE HILLSIDE AND PLANT ON THE HIGHEST POINT SOME PRETTY KIOSQUE WHENCE PERHAPS MY EYES MAY CATCH THE SHIMMER OF THE MEDITERRANEAN ORANGE AND LEMON TREES AND ALL CHOICEST THINGS THAT GROW
BUT ONLY ON THE EXPRESS CONDITION OF BEING ALLOWED TO WORK MY WILL UPON THE GRANGE AND MAKE A PARK THERE I HAVE DEMANDED FROM MY FATHER IN SET TERMS A GRANT OF WATER WHICH CAN BE BROUGHT THITHER FROM MAUCOMBE
WITH THE ADDITION OF THE FATHER'S SAVINGS
WHAT GRATITUDE COULD YOU FEEL TO ME LATER FOR A GIFT IN WHICH MY GOODWILL COUNTED FOR NOTHING IF DURING THE TIME THAT I REMAINED INDIFFERENT TO YOU YIELDING ONLY A PASSIVE OBEDIENCE SUCH AS MY MOTHER HAS JUST BEEN URGING ON ME A CHILD WERE BORN TO US
HAVING RENOUNCED ALL IDEA OF FINDING IN MARRIAGE THOSE TRANSPORTS OF LOVE ON WHICH OUR MINDS USED SO OFTEN AND WITH SUCH PERILOUS RAPTURE TO DWELL I FOUND A GENTLE CALM SETTLING OVER ME IF DEBARRED FROM LOVE
A YEAR HENCE HIS STYLE WILL HAVE STILL FURTHER IMPROVED LOUIS IS NOW IN HIS FIRST TRANSPORT WHAT I LOOK FORWARD TO IS THE UNIFORM AND CONTINUOUS SENSATION OF CONTENT WHICH OUGHT TO BE THE FRUIT OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE
THAT LOUIS HAS SINCE CONFESSED TO ME THE ALARM IT CAUSED HIM TO FIND IN ME SO LITTLE OF THE IGNORANT MAIDEN THEN I LISTENED TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN REPLY HE GOT MIXED UP IN HIS ARGUMENTS AS PEOPLE DO WHEN HANDICAPPED BY FEAR
THE IMPORTANT POINT OF SEPARATING MARRIAGE FROM MARITAL RIGHTS WAS SETTLED IN A CONVERSATION BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HE GAVE PROOF OF AN EXCELLENT TEMPER AND A TENDER HEART
SO HERE ARE MY BLACK HAIR AND MY BLACK EYES WHOSE LASHES ACT ACCORDING TO YOU LIKE VENETIAN BLINDS MY COMMANDING AIR AND MY WHOLE PERSON RAISED TO THE RANK OF SOVEREIGN POWER TEN YEARS HENCE DEAR
SPARE ME THE ANNOYANCES TO WHICH THE STRANGENESS OF OUR MUTUAL POSITION MIGHT GIVE RISE TO OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHERS I AM NEITHER WHIMSICAL NOR PRUDISH AND SHOULD BE SORRY TO GET THAT REPUTATION
EVERY WITCHERY OF IMAGINATION OF PASSION OF RELUCTANCE OVERCOME OF THE IDEAL PASSING INTO REALITY PLAYED ITS PART YET IN SPITE OF ALL THIS ENCHANTMENT I ONCE MORE STOOD OUT FOR MY COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THESE THREE OBVIOUS DRAWBACKS MADE HIM DISTRUSTFUL OF HIMSELF HE DOUBTED HIS POWER TO MAKE ME HAPPY AND GUESSED THAT HE HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS
AND MY CHILDREN IF I HAVE ANY WILL NOT BE RENT FROM ME THEY WILL BE MINE TO TRAIN AND MAKE MEN OF THE JOY OF MY LIFE IF YOU ALSO ARE TRUE TO YOUR DESTINY
AFTER SUCCESSFULLY ELUDING THE CONSCRIPTION HE WAS FORCED TO SEND HIM TO THE ARMY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN TO JOIN THE EMPEROR'S BODYGUARD AFTER LEIPSIC NO MORE WAS HEARD OF HIM
IN THE CASTLE OF MAUCOMBE
AND TO QUEEN IT IN PARIS YOUR POOR LITTLE SWEETHEART RENEE THAT CHILD OF THE DESERT HAS FALLEN FROM THE EMPYREAN WHITHER TOGETHER WE HAD SOARED INTO THE VULGAR REALITIES OF A LIFE AS HOMELY AS A DAISY'S
AND THAT I WAS VERY WELL PLEASED HIS FATHER SHOULD CONTINUE TO LOOK AFTER THE ESTATE AND PRACTISE ECONOMIES BECAUSE I WISHED HIM TO DEVOTE HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO POLITICS IF WE HAD CHILDREN I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM ALL PROSPEROUS AND WITH GOOD STATE APPOINTMENTS
HE WAS GREATLY ASTONISHED TO FIND ME AT ONCE SO REASONABLE AND SO APT AT REASONING BUT HE MADE ME A SOLEMN PROMISE AFTER WHICH I TOOK HIS HAND AND PRESSED IT AFFECTIONATELY WE WERE MARRIED AT THE END OF THE WEEK
HE HOARDED HIS INCOME FOR HIM AND GUARDED CAREFULLY THE PORTION OF INHERITANCE WHICH FELL TO HIM
WE SAT FIVE IN THE ANTIQUATED CARRIAGE AND ARRIVED IN STATE ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK THE DINNER WAS FOR THREE AT THE GRANGE WHICH IS THE DWELLING OF THE BARON DE L'ESTORADE MY FATHER IN LAW TO BE HAS YOU SEE NO CASTLE
WHEN I AM WITH YOU LOVE SO TRANSPORTS ME THAT I AM POWERLESS TO EXPRESS THE DEPTH OF MY AFFECTION I CAN BUT WORSHIP AND ADMIRE ONLY AT A DISTANCE DOES THE POWER OF SPEECH RETURN
DEAR THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH WOULD BESET MY LIFE HAD APPEARED TO ME CLEARLY AS IN A VISION AND I WAS SINCERELY ANXIOUS TO MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF THE MAN I MARRIED NOW IN THE SOLITUDE OF A LIFE LIKE OURS
I LONG FOR THE DAY WHICH SHALL MAKE YOU A MOTHER THAT I MAY SEE YOU CONTENT WITH THE FULNESS OF YOUR LIFE MAY HEAR YOU IN THE SWEET VOICE I LOVE AND WITH THE THOUGHTS BLESS THE LOVE WHICH HAS REFRESHED MY SOUL AND GIVEN NEW VIGOR TO MY POWERS
A FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS LEADS TO THE DOOR WHICH IS PROTECTED BY A PENT HOUSE ROOF
AND BEFORE LONG IT BECAME CLEAR THAT CHANCE HAD GIVEN ME FOR ADVERSARY ONE WHO WAS THE LESS FITTED FOR THE CONTEST BECAUSE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF WHAT YOU MAGNILOQUENTLY CALL MY GREATNESS OF SOUL BROKEN BY SUFFERINGS AND MISFORTUNE
THAT MY DESTINED HUSBAND WAS SLOWLY TRAVELING ON FOOT THROUGH RUSSIA POLAND AND GERMANY HIS BAD LUCK ONLY FORSOOK HIM AT BERLIN WHERE THE FRENCH MINISTER HELPED HIS RETURN TO HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
OLD GENTLEMAN OF GOOD FAMILY WHO HAS MADE HIMSELF RICH AFTER THE PROVINCIAL FASHION BY SCRAPING AND PARING
AT LAST IT DAWNED UPON ME THAT THE UNEXPECTED RETURN OF THIS SON WAS THE CAUSE OF MY OWN WHO COULD HAVE IMAGINED WHILST FANCY WAS LEADING US A GIDDY DANCE
TO BE THE UNCEASING SPRING OF HAPPINESS FOR A MAN WHO KNOWS IT AND ADDS GRATITUDE TO LOVE AH DEAR ONE THIS IS A CONVICTION WHICH FORTIFIES THE SOUL EVEN MORE THAN THE MOST PASSIONATE LOVE CAN DO
AH MY LOVE BY THE ARDOR WITH WHICH HE EMBRACED MY PLANS I CAN GAUGE THE DEPTH OF HIS AFFECTION TO CONCLUDE HERE IS A LETTER HE WROTE ME YESTERDAY FROM MARSEILLES WHERE HE HAD GONE TO SPEND A FEW HOURS MY SWEET RENEE
A FRIENDSHIP WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF THESE ADVANTAGES WOULD SHUT ITS EYES TO MANY OF THE IMPERFECTIONS OF HUMANITY NOW THERE WAS NO OBSTACLE TO THE EXISTENCE OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MYSELF AND LOUIS DE L'ESTORADE
AND ROOFED WITH HOLLOW TILES OF A GOOD RED CONSTITUTE THE GRANGE THE RAFTERS BEND UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THIS BRICK KILN THE WINDOWS INSERTED CASUALLY WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT SYMMETRY HAVE ENORMOUS SHUTTERS PAINTED YELLOW
EVEN THE OLD MAN WOULD NOT BE A BLOT UPON MY PRETTY HOME AND HAS BROUGHT HIMSELF INTO LINE WITH ALL MY IMPROVEMENTS TO PLEASE ME HE HAS ADOPTED THE DRESS AND WITH THE DRESS THE MANNERS OF THE DAY WE HAVE ENGLISH HORSES
MY HAPPINESS WOULD WOUND HIM AND HAS TO BE CONCEALED HE IS SENSITIVE AS A WOMAN LIKE ALL MEN WHO HAVE SUFFERED MUCH FOR THREE MONTHS WE REMAINED AS WE WERE BEFORE MARRIAGE AS YOU MAY IMAGINE
THE LOVE WHICH IS MY PRIDE AND WHENCE I HAVE DRAWN AS FROM A MAGIC FOUNTAIN FRESH LIFE
THAT SHOWED ITSELF IN CONSTANT OPPOSITION FAULT FINDING AND COMPLAINT THE REAL MISTAKE WAS THAT WE WERE BOYS THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER ALTOGETHER ANTAGONISTIC TO THE BOY NATURE
I SHALL NOW PROCEED IN THE ENUMERATION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THOSE DEFECTS WHICH HAVE HITHERTO DISAPPOINTED OUR HOPES FROM THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED AMONG OURSELVES TO FORM A SAFE AND SATISFACTORY JUDGMENT OF THE PROPER REMEDY IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
AND EVERYTHING READY FOR MIGRATING AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE
AND DIAMOND'S CHIEF PLEASURE SEEMED TO BE TO LIE AMONGST THEM AND BREATHE THE PURE AIR BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS DREAMING OF THE COUNTRY AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND AND TRYING TO RECALL THE SONGS THE RIVER USED TO SING FOR THIS WAS MORE LIKE BEING AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
BUT THERE'S YOUNG DIAMOND LISTENING TO ALL WE'RE SAYING AND HE KNOWS WELL ENOUGH THERE ARE HORSES IN HEAVEN FOR ANGELS TO RIDE UPON AS WELL AS OTHER ANIMALS LIONS AND EAGLES AND BULLS IN MORE IMPORTANT SITUATIONS
MY FATHER WOULD HEAR HER COMPLAINTS TO THE END WITHOUT PUTTING IN A WORD EXCEPT IT WERE TO ASK HER A QUESTION
HE PICKED IT UP AND RAN BACK AND OPENED THE STABLE DOOR AND WENT IN
ANKLE INDEED WHY SHOULD YOU APE YOUR BETTERS HORSES AIN'T GOT ANY ANKLES
BUT HE HELPED HIS FATHER STILL BOTH IN THE STABLE AND THE HARNESS ROOM AND GENERALLY WENT WITH HIM ON THE BOX THAT HE MIGHT LEARN TO DRIVE A PAIR AND BE READY TO OPEN THE CARRIAGE DOOR MISTER RAYMOND ADVISED HIS FATHER TO GIVE HIM PLENTY OF LIBERTY
AM I AWAKE OR AM I ASLEEP BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR THERE WAS NORTH WIND CALLING HIM
THIS RIGHT WOULD REMAIN UNDIMINISHED
THE LIGHT SHOWED THE WHITE MARK ON DIAMOND'S FOREHEAD BUT RUBY'S EYE SHONE SO BRIGHT THAT HE THOUGHT MORE LIGHT CAME OUT OF IT THAN WENT IN THIS IS WHAT HE SAW BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK HE HEARD
WHAT IS IT NOW THERE'S A FRIEND OF NANNY'S A LAME BOY CALLED JIM I'VE HEARD OF HIM SAID MISTER RAYMOND WELL NANNY DOESN'T CARE MUCH ABOUT GOING TO THE COUNTRY SIR
AND HE WORKS LIKE A HORSE I DARESAY HE GRUDGES HIS MASTER THE BEER HE DRINKS
A GREAT PUFF OF WIND CAME AGAINST HIM AND IN OBEDIENCE TO IT HE TURNED HIS BACK AND WENT AS IT BLEW
THE NORTH WIND OFTEN BLEW WHEN DIAMOND WENT TO HIS BED WHICH WAS IN A TINY ROOM IN THE ROOF HE HEARD IT LIKE THE SEA MOANING AND WHEN HE FELL ASLEEP HE STILL HEARD THE MOANING ALL AT ONCE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
HE SHOT HIS HEAD OVER THE PARTITION AND LOOKING DOWN AT HIM SAID YOU JUST WAIT TILL TO MORROW AND YOU'LL SEE WHETHER I'M SPEAKING THE TRUTH OR NOT I DECLARE THE OLD HORSE IS FAST ASLEEP DIAMOND NO I WON'T
THE INORDINATE PRIDE OF STATE IMPORTANCE HAS SUGGESTED TO SOME MINDS AN OBJECTION TO THE PRINCIPLE OF A GUARANTY IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO SING THESE WERE VERY DIFFERENT TIMES FROM THOSE WHEN HE USED TO DRIVE THE CAB BUT YOU MUST NOT SUPPOSE THAT DIAMOND WAS IDLE HE DID NOT DO SO MUCH FOR HIS MOTHER NOW BECAUSE NANNY OCCUPIED HIS FORMER PLACE
THE GENIUS OF THE CITIZENS THE DEGREE OF INFORMATION THEY POSSESS THE STATE OF COMMERCE OF ARTS OF INDUSTRY THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MANY MORE TOO COMPLEX MINUTE OR ADVENTITIOUS TO ADMIT OF A PARTICULAR SPECIFICATION
IN THE COURSE OF TIME AND THINGS AN EQUILIBRIUM AS FAR AS IT IS ATTAINABLE IN SO COMPLICATED A SUBJECT WILL BE ESTABLISHED EVERYWHERE
BUT FOR US SHE THOUGHT ALMOST ANYTHING GOOD ENOUGH SHE WOULD FOR INSTANCE GIVE US THE THINNEST OF MILK WE SAID SHE SKIMMED IT THREE TIMES BEFORE SHE THOUGHT IT BLUE ENOUGH FOR US MY TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS DID NOT MIND IT SO MUCH AS I DID
HE WOULD ASK OUR VERSION OF THE AFFAIR AND LISTEN TO THAT AS HE HAD LISTENED TO HERS THEN HE WOULD SET FORTH TO US WHERE WE HAD BEEN WRONG IF WE WERE WRONG AND SEND US AWAY WITH AN INJUNCTION NOT TO PROVOKE MISSUS MITCHELL WHO COULDN'T HELP BEING SHORT IN HER TEMPER POOR THING
WHICH SHE CLAIMED FOR ALL HIGHLAND FOLK A LIGHT STEP A SWEET VOICE AND A MOST BOUNTEOUS HAND BUT THERE I COME INTO THE MORAL NATURE OF HER
WITH A WISDOM I HAVE SINCE LEARNED TO COMPREHEND THOUGH I REMEMBER IT SHOCKED ME A LITTLE AT THE TIME ALL THIS SET ME THINKING BEFORE THE DRESSING OF LITTLE DAVIE WAS OVER I HAD MY QUESTION TO PUT TO KIRSTY IT WAS IN FACT THE SAME QUESTION
BY BEING CROSS WITH THEM THIS COMES OF NOT HAVING FAITH ENOUGH IN GOD AND SHOWS HOW NECESSARY THIS FAITH IS FOR WHEN WE LOSE IT WE LOSE EVEN THE KINDNESS WHICH ALONE CAN SOOTHE THE SUFFERING
WILL IN A DEGREE BE AT HIS OWN OPTION AND CAN BE REGULATED BY AN ATTENTION TO HIS RESOURCES THE RICH MAY BE EXTRAVAGANT THE POOR CAN BE FRUGAL AND PRIVATE OPPRESSION MAY ALWAYS BE AVOIDED BY A JUDICIOUS SELECTION OF OBJECTS
BY THEIR VERY NATURE BE ABOUT SOMETHING AMISS I HAVE OCCASIONALLY WONDERED HOW SHE WOULD HAVE BEHAVED TO A GIRL ON REFLECTION I THINK A LITTLE BETTER BUT THE GIRL WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE OFF BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED FROM HER AS WE DID
AS FOR NANNY SHE HAD BEEN SO HAPPY EVER SINCE SHE LEFT THE HOSPITAL
IN A RATHER DIFFERENT TONE I SAY DIAMOND I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE AN HONEST OLD HORSE LIKE YOU THINK OF ME LIKE THAT I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH IT WAS MY OWN FAULT THAT I FELL LAME I TOLD YOU SO RETURNED THE OTHER
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO DIAMOND AND RUBY IT WAS FRIDAY NIGHT AND DIAMOND LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSEHOLD HAD HAD VERY LITTLE TO EAT THAT DAY THE MOTHER WOULD ALWAYS PAY THE WEEK'S RENT
BETTER BUT FALL ASLEEP BETWEEN EVERY STEP YOU'LL RUN A GOOD CHANCE OF LAMING ALL YOUR ANKLES AS YOU CALL THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER IT'S NOT YOUR LIVELY HORSE THAT COMES TO GRIEF IN THAT WAY
BUT KIRSTY HAD COME FROM A REGION WHERE THE HILLS WERE HILLS INDEED HILLS WITH MIGHTY SKELETONS OF STONE INSIDE THEM
WHICH WERE EVER TRYING TO GET UP A COUNTRY WHERE EVERY CLIFF AND ROCK AND WELL HAD ITS STORY
BUT SHE WOULD PUT A SKIN OVER IT AFTER HER OWN FASHION
IN ALL SITUATIONS A FORMIDABLE OBJECTION IN A BRANCH OF TAXATION WHERE NO LIMITS TO THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE NATURE OF THINGS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FIXED RULE NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE END
THE WANT OF A MUTUAL GUARANTY OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS IS ANOTHER CAPITAL IMPERFECTION IN THE FEDERAL PLAN THERE IS NOTHING OF THIS KIND DECLARED IN THE ARTICLES THAT COMPOSE IT
WHERE THE WHOLE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT IS IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE
THE NATURAL CURE FOR AN ILL ADMINISTRATION IN A POPULAR OR REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION IS A CHANGE OF MEN A GUARANTY BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY WOULD BE AS MUCH LEVELLED AGAINST THE USURPATIONS OF RULERS AS AGAINST THE FERMENTS AND OUTRAGES OF FACTION AND SEDITION IN THE COMMUNITY
THE WEATHER WAS VERY HOT AND THE WOODS VERY SHADOWY THERE WERE NOT A GREAT MANY WILD FLOWERS
A LITTLE LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE DUSTY WINDOW FROM A GAS LAMP SUFFICIENT TO SHOW HIM DIAMOND AND RUBY WITH THEIR TWO HEADS UP
I KNOW HE CAN SHINE BOOTS SIR SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR US
YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO THE STABLE LOOK AT THE HORSE NEXT YOU HE'S SOMETHING LIKE A HORSE ALL SKIN AND BONE AND HIS MASTER AIN'T OVER KIND TO HIM EITHER HE PUT A STINGING LASH ON HIS WHIP LAST WEEK BUT THAT OLD HORSE KNOWS HE'S GOT THE WIFE AND CHILDREN TO KEEP
THERE I'VE DONE I'M GOING TO SLEEP I'LL TRY TO THINK AS WELL OF YOU AS I CAN IF YOU WOULD BUT STEP OUT A BIT AND RUN OFF A LITTLE OF YOUR FAT HERE DIAMOND BEGAN TO DOUBLE UP HIS KNEES BUT RUBY SPOKE AGAIN AND AS YOUNG DIAMOND THOUGHT
WHERE THEY FOUND A CART WAITING TO CARRY THEM AND THEIR LUGGAGE TO THE MOUND WHICH WAS THE NAME OF MISTER RAYMOND'S NEW RESIDENCE I WILL NOT DESCRIBE THE VARIED FEELINGS OF THE PARTY AS THEY WENT OR WHEN THEY ARRIVED ALL I WILL SAY IS THAT DIAMOND WHO IS MY ONLY CARE WAS FULL OF QUIET DELIGHT
AND MUST FOR A LONG TIME CONSTITUTE THE CHIEF PART OF THE REVENUE RAISED IN THIS COUNTRY THOSE OF THE DIRECT KIND WHICH PRINCIPALLY RELATE TO LAND AND BUILDINGS MAY ADMIT OF A RULE OF APPORTIONMENT EITHER THE VALUE OF LAND
HOLD YOUR TONGUE OR I'LL BREAK MY HALTER AND BE AT YOU WITH YOUR HANDSOME FAT NEVER MIND DIAMOND YOU'RE A GOOD HORSE YOU CAN'T HURT ME CAN'T HURT YOU JUST LET ME ONCE TRY NO YOU CAN'T WHY THEN
CHAPTER FOUR KIRSTY MY FATHER HAD A HOUSEKEEPER A TRUSTY WOMAN HE CONSIDERED HER WE THOUGHT HER VERY OLD I SUPPOSE SHE WAS ABOUT FORTY SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT FOR SHE WAS GRIM FACED AND CENSORIOUS
IT'S MY BELIEF ONCE OUT THEY'D STICK OUT FOR EVER TALK OF KICKING WHY DON'T YOU PUT ONE FOOT BEFORE THE OTHER NOW AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE IN THE CAB THE ABUSE MASTER GETS FOR YOUR SAKE IS QUITE SHAMEFUL NO DECENT HORSE WOULD BRING IT ON HIM
THE CONSEQUENCE CLEARLY IS THAT THERE CAN BE NO COMMON MEASURE OF NATIONAL WEALTH AND OF COURSE NO GENERAL OR STATIONARY RULE BY WHICH THE ABILITY OF A STATE TO PAY TAXES CAN BE DETERMINED
JOSEPH YOUR MASTER SHOULD GROW LEAN I COULD HAVE PRETENDED TO BE LAME BUT THAT NO HORSE LEAST OF ALL AN ANGEL HORSE WOULD DO SO I MUST BE LAME AND SO I SPRAINED MY ANKLE FOR THE ANGEL HORSES HAVE ANKLES
HAVE NO POWERS TO EXACT OBEDIENCE OR PUNISH DISOBEDIENCE TO THEIR RESOLUTIONS EITHER BY PECUNIARY MULCTS
ONCE I AM FAT MY NATURE IS TO KEEP FAT FOR A LONG TIME AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN MASTER MIGHT COME HOME AND WANT TO SEE ME YOU CONCEITED GOOD FOR NOTHING BRUTE YOU'RE ONLY FIT FOR THE KNACKER'S YARD YOU WANTED TO LOOK HANDSOME DID YOU
AND ENOUGH LIKEWISE TO SERVE AS A BACKGROUND TO MY DESCRIPTION OF KIRSTY KIRSTY WAS A HIGHLAND WOMAN WHO HAD THE CHARGE OF THE HOUSE IN WHICH THE FARM SERVANTS LIVED SHE WAS A CHEERFUL GRACIOUS KIND WOMAN A WOMAN OF GOD'S MAKING ONE WOULD SAY
BUT THE DOOR IS LOCKED HE KNEW WHERE THE KEY WAS IN A CERTAIN HOLE IN THE WALL FAR TOO HIGH FOR HIM TO GET AT HE RAN TO THE PLACE HOWEVER
SAID MISTER RAYMOND I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU
IT WAS SHE WHO GAVE US SOMETHING TO EAT AS OFTEN AND AS MUCH AS WE WANTED
AND THE MOST OF THE WILD FLOWERS RISE EARLY TO BE BEFORE THE LEAVES BECAUSE IF THEY DID NOT
THERE IS DOUBTLESS A STRIKING ABSURDITY IN SUPPOSING THAT A RIGHT OF THIS KIND DOES NOT EXIST
HE ASKED I'M ALWAYS WANTING SOMETHING SIR ANSWERED DIAMOND WELL THAT'S QUITE RIGHT SO LONG AS WHAT YOU WANT IS RIGHT EVERYBODY IS ALWAYS WANTING SOMETHING ONLY WE DON'T MENTION IT
DIAMOND IN CONSEQUENCE HAD GONE TO BED VERY QUIET AND THOUGHTFUL A LITTLE TROUBLED INDEED IT HAD BEEN A VERY STORMY WINTER
AFTER DOING EVERYTHING THAT FELL TO HIS SHARE THE BOY HAD A WEALTH OF TIME AT HIS DISPOSAL AND A HAPPY SOMETIMES A MERRY TIME IT WAS
BY WHICH IT IS DECLARED THAT EACH STATE SHALL RETAIN EVERY POWER JURISDICTION AND RIGHT
THEY THINK I'M SILLY ADDED DIAMOND WITH ONE OF HIS SWEETEST SMILES WHAT MISTER RAYMOND THOUGHT I DARE HARDLY ATTEMPT TO PUT DOWN HERE
MY IMPRESSION IS THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE HALF SHE TOLD HIM AT ALL EVENTS
OTHER DEFECTS OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HAMILTON
EVERY POSSIBLE PRIVILEGE IN THEIR NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES I MEANT TO DO IT DIAMOND AT THE WORDS THE OLD HORSE AROSE WITH A SCRAMBLE LIKE THUNDER SHOT HIS ANGRY HEAD AND GLARING EYE OVER INTO RUBY'S STALL AND SAID
A BOY LIKE THAT HE SAID OUGHT NOT TO BE PUSHED JOSEPH ASSENTED HEARTILY
WHETHER HE DISPLEASES US IN THINGS IN WHICH WE THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CONTROL HIM OR IN THINGS IN WHICH WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE NOT IF HE DISPLEASES US WE MAY EXPRESS OUR DISTASTE AND WE MAY STAND ALOOF FROM A PERSON AS WELL AS FROM A THING THAT DISPLEASES US
NOT SIMPLY THREATENED BUT LONG SINCE CARRIED INTO TRIUMPHANT EFFECT
THOUGH NOT REQUIRED BY THEIR RELIGION
BUT WHICH DOES NOT AFFECT THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH HIM ACTS INJURIOUS TO OTHERS REQUIRE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TREATMENT ENCROACHMENT ON THEIR RIGHTS
INFLICTION ON THEM OF ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE NOT JUSTIFIED BY HIS OWN RIGHTS FALSEHOOD OR DUPLICITY IN DEALING WITH THEM UNFAIR OR UNGENEROUS USE OF ADVANTAGES OVER THEM
AND USUALLY DIMINISHES BY A GREATER OR LESS AMOUNT THE GENERAL RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY IF HE DETERIORATES HIS BODILY OR MENTAL FACULTIES HE NOT ONLY BRINGS EVIL UPON ALL WHO DEPENDED ON HIM FOR ANY PORTION OF THEIR HAPPINESS
IF PROTECTION AGAINST THEMSELVES IS CONFESSEDLY DUE TO CHILDREN AND PERSONS UNDER AGE
THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTS DO NOT THEN FALL ON HIMSELF BUT ON OTHERS AND SOCIETY AS THE PROTECTOR OF ALL ITS MEMBERS MUST RETALIATE ON HIM MUST INFLICT PAIN ON HIM FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF PUNISHMENT
AND PROFESS TO BE A KIND OF CHRISTIANS NO ONE HAS A DEEPER DISAPPROBATION THAN I HAVE OF THIS MORMON INSTITUTION
WHICH ARE NOT SOCIAL BUT INDIVIDUAL ALTHOUGH IT IS TO THIS CLASS SURELY THAT THE ACT OF DRINKING FERMENTED LIQUORS BELONGS SELLING FERMENTED LIQUORS HOWEVER IS TRADING AND TRADING IS A SOCIAL ACT BUT THE INFRINGEMENT COMPLAINED OF
BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE BY NO MEANS EXPLAINS EITHER THE DEGREE OR THE KIND OF THEIR REPUGNANCE FOR WINE ALSO IS FORBIDDEN BY THEIR RELIGION AND TO PARTAKE OF IT IS BY ALL MUSSULMANS ACCOUNTED WRONG BUT NOT DISGUSTING
IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL OF ALL HUMAN PROPENSITIES AS A FIRST INSTANCE CONSIDER THE ANTIPATHIES WHICH MEN CHERISH ON NO BETTER GROUNDS THAN THAT PERSONS WHOSE RELIGIOUS OPINIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THEIRS DO NOT PRACTISE THEIR RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
THERE ARE MANY WHO CONSIDER AS AN INJURY TO THEMSELVES ANY CONDUCT WHICH THEY HAVE A DISTASTE FOR AND RESENT IT AS AN OUTRAGE TO THEIR FEELINGS AS A RELIGIOUS BIGOT WHEN CHARGED WITH DISREGARDING THE RELIGIOUS FEELINGS OF OTHERS
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE PURPOSELY INFLICTED ON HIM FOR THE SAKE OF PUNISHMENT A PERSON WHO SHOWS RASHNESS OBSTINACY SELF CONCEIT WHO CANNOT LIVE WITHIN MODERATE MEANS WHO CANNOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF FROM HURTFUL INDULGENCES
THAT EVERY OTHER INDIVIDUAL SHALL ACT IN EVERY RESPECT EXACTLY AS HE OUGHT THAT WHOSOEVER FAILS THEREOF IN THE SMALLEST PARTICULAR VIOLATES MY SOCIAL RIGHT AND ENTITLES ME TO DEMAND FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE REMOVAL OF THE GRIEVANCE
UNDERTAKES TO POINT OUT THE BROAD AND IMPASSABLE BARRIER WHICH DIVIDES SUCH PRINCIPLES FROM THOSE OF THE ASSOCIATION ALL MATTERS RELATING TO THOUGHT OPINION CONSCIENCE APPEAR TO ME HE SAYS TO BE WITHOUT THE SPHERE OF LEGISLATION
IT IS A DIRECT INFRACTION OF THAT PRINCIPLE BEING A MERE RIVETING OF THE CHAINS OF ONE HALF OF THE COMMUNITY AND AN EMANCIPATION OF THE OTHER FROM RECIPROCITY OF OBLIGATION TOWARDS THEM
COMBINED WITH THE NOTION THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO A VETO ON THE MANNER IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS SHALL SPEND THEIR INCOMES WE HAVE ONLY FURTHER TO SUPPOSE A CONSIDERABLE DIFFUSION OF SOCIALIST OPINIONS
THE MORAL CULPABILITY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME GEORGE BARNWELL MURDERED HIS UNCLE TO GET MONEY FOR HIS MISTRESS BUT IF HE HAD DONE IT TO SET HIMSELF UP IN BUSINESS HE WOULD EQUALLY HAVE BEEN HANGED
BUT THE OPINION OF A SIMILAR MAJORITY IMPOSED AS A LAW ON THE MINORITY ON QUESTIONS OF SELF REGARDING CONDUCT IS QUITE AS LIKELY TO BE WRONG AS RIGHT FOR IN THESE CASES PUBLIC OPINION MEANS AT THE BEST
AND SINCE THIS JUDGMENT AND FEELING ARE A FACT WHICH HE WOULD PREFER TO AVOID IT IS DOING HIM A SERVICE TO WARN HIM OF IT BEFOREHAND AS OF ANY OTHER DISAGREEABLE CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HE EXPOSES HIMSELF
THEY SHOULD BE FOR EVER STIMULATING EACH OTHER TO INCREASED EXERCISE OF THEIR HIGHER FACULTIES AND INCREASED DIRECTION OF THEIR FEELINGS AND AIMS TOWARDS WISE INSTEAD OF FOOLISH ELEVATING INSTEAD OF DEGRADING OBJECTS AND CONTEMPLATIONS
WHO ARE THE ASCENDANT POWER IN THE PRESENT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITION OF THE KINGDOM IT IS BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE THAT PERSONS OF THESE SENTIMENTS MAY AT SOME TIME OR OTHER COMMAND A MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT HOW WILL THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY
BY SUSPENDING THE GREATER OPERATIONS OF INDUSTRY ON A PARTICULAR DAY BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION GROUNDED ON THE DIRECT INTEREST WHICH OTHERS HAVE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL'S OBSERVANCE OF THE PRACTICE
THE OPERATIVES ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT IN THINKING THAT IF ALL WORKED ON SUNDAY SEVEN DAYS WORK WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN FOR SIX DAYS WAGES BUT SO LONG AS THE GREAT MASS OF EMPLOYMENTS ARE SUSPENDED
WHY IT MAY BE ASKED SHOULD NOT LAW SO FAR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH PRACTICABILITY AND SOCIAL CONVENIENCE ENDEAVOUR TO REPRESS THESE ALSO AND AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE UNAVOIDABLE IMPERFECTIONS OF LAW
WHICH HAS BEEN FATAL TO THEIR PREDECESSORS I FULLY ADMIT THAT THE MISCHIEF WHICH A PERSON DOES TO HIMSELF MAY SERIOUSLY AFFECT BOTH THROUGH THEIR SYMPATHIES AND THEIR INTERESTS THOSE NEARLY CONNECTED WITH HIM
WHEN ONCE IT THOROUGHLY SINKS INTO THE FEELINGS SEEMS ALWAYS TO EXCITE EVEN IN THOSE WHOSE PERSONAL HABITS ARE ANYTHING BUT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEANLY AND OF WHICH THE SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS IMPURITY SO INTENSE IN THE HINDOOS IS A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE
BUT ON THAT OF THE BUYER AND CONSUMER SINCE THE STATE MIGHT JUST AS WELL FORBID HIM TO DRINK WINE AS PURPOSELY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OBTAIN IT THE SECRETARY HOWEVER SAYS
OR JUSTIFIED BY ALLOWABLE SELF PREFERENCE IS A SUBJECT OF MORAL DISAPPROBATION FOR THAT FAILURE BUT NOT FOR THE CAUSE OF IT NOR FOR THE ERRORS MERELY PERSONAL TO HIMSELF WHICH MAY HAVE REMOTELY LED TO IT
EVERY ONE WHO RECEIVES THE PROTECTION OF SOCIETY OWES A RETURN FOR THE BENEFIT AND THE FACT OF LIVING IN SOCIETY RENDERS IT INDISPENSABLE THAT EACH SHOULD BE BOUND TO OBSERVE A CERTAIN LINE OF CONDUCT TOWARDS THE REST THIS CONDUCT CONSISTS FIRST
THEIR AVERSION TO THE FLESH OF THE UNCLEAN BEAST IS ON THE CONTRARY OF THAT PECULIAR CHARACTER RESEMBLING AN INSTINCTIVE ANTIPATHY WHICH THE IDEA OF UNCLEANNESS
AND OPINIONS PROPOSED WHICH ASSERT AN UNLIMITED RIGHT IN THE PUBLIC NOT ONLY TO PROHIBIT BY LAW EVERYTHING WHICH IT THINKS WRONG BUT IN ORDER TO GET AT WHAT IT THINKS WRONG TO PROHIBIT ANY NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH IT ADMITS TO BE INNOCENT
NOR IS THERE ANYTHING WHICH TENDS MORE TO DISCREDIT AND FRUSTRATE THE BETTER MEANS OF INFLUENCING CONDUCT THAN A RESORT TO THE WORSE IF THERE BE AMONG THOSE WHOM IT IS ATTEMPTED TO COERCE INTO PRUDENCE OR TEMPERANCE ANY OF THE MATERIAL
TO BE FIXED ON SOME EQUITABLE PRINCIPLE OF THE LABOURS AND SACRIFICES INCURRED FOR DEFENDING THE SOCIETY OR ITS MEMBERS FROM INJURY AND MOLESTATION THESE CONDITIONS SOCIETY IS JUSTIFIED IN ENFORCING AT ALL COSTS TO THOSE WHO ENDEAVOUR TO WITHHOLD FULFILMENT
EFFECTUAL SUMPTUARY LAW AND THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE UNION IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR A PERSON POSSESSING A VERY LARGE INCOME TO FIND ANY MODE OF SPENDING IT WHICH WILL NOT INCUR POPULAR DISAPPROBATION
IT MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE ESTABLISHMENT BY CUSTOM OF A HOLIDAY ON SOME OTHER DAY OF THE WEEK FOR THOSE PARTICULAR CLASSES OF PERSONS THE ONLY GROUND THEREFORE ON WHICH RESTRICTIONS ON SUNDAY AMUSEMENTS CAN BE DEFENDED MUST BE THAT THEY ARE RELIGIOUSLY WRONG
AND IF ADMITTED WOULD FULLY JUSTIFY THEM
BY DERIVING A PROFIT FROM THE CREATION OF A MISERY I AM TAXED TO SUPPORT IT IMPEDES MY RIGHT TO FREE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT BY SURROUNDING MY PATH WITH DANGERS AND BY WEAKENING AND DEMORALISING SOCIETY
THERE ARE FEW ACTS WHICH CHRISTIANS AND EUROPEANS REGARD WITH MORE UNAFFECTED DISGUST THAN MUSSULMANS REGARD THIS PARTICULAR MODE OF SATISFYING HUNGER IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE AN OFFENCE AGAINST THEIR RELIGION
AND EVEN IF RIGHT ARE AS LIKELY AS NOT TO BE MISAPPLIED TO INDIVIDUAL CASES
OR OTHER PREPONDERATING POWER IN THE COUNTRY AND ALL PERSONS MUST BE READY TO CONFORM TO THE IDEA OF A CHRISTIAN COMMONWEALTH AS UNDERSTOOD BY THE EARLY SETTLERS IN NEW ENGLAND IF A RELIGIOUS PROFESSION SIMILAR TO THEIRS
GROSS DISGUSTING WHAT DO PROTESTANTS THINK OF THESE PERFECTLY SINCERE FEELINGS AND OF THE ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE THEM AGAINST NON CATHOLICS
THAT IS OF AN OVERRULING MAJORITY THOUGH OFTEN WRONG IS LIKELY TO BE STILL OFTENER RIGHT BECAUSE ON SUCH QUESTIONS THEY ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO JUDGE OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH SOME MODE OF CONDUCT IF ALLOWED TO BE PRACTISED WOULD AFFECT THEMSELVES
EXCEPT PERHAPS TO THAT OF HOLDING OPINIONS IN SECRET WITHOUT EVER DISCLOSING THEM FOR
WE MUST BEWARE OF ADMITTING A PRINCIPLE OF WHICH WE SHOULD RESENT AS A GROSS INJUSTICE THE APPLICATION TO OURSELVES THE PRECEDING INSTANCES MAY BE OBJECTED TO ALTHOUGH UNREASONABLY
AS DRAWN FROM CONTINGENCIES IMPOSSIBLE AMONG US OPINION IN THIS COUNTRY NOT BEING LIKELY TO ENFORCE ABSTINENCE FROM MEATS OR TO INTERFERE WITH PEOPLE FOR WORSHIPPING AND FOR EITHER MARRYING OR NOT MARRYING ACCORDING TO THEIR CREED OR INCLINATION
AND IT EASILY COMES TO BE CONSIDERED A MARK OF SPIRIT AND COURAGE TO FLY IN THE FACE OF SUCH USURPED AUTHORITY AND DO WITH OSTENTATION THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT ENJOINS AS IN THE FASHION OF GROSSNESS WHICH SUCCEEDED IN THE TIME OF CHARLES TWO
IT HAS HAD THE WHOLE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD
DISSIMULATION AND INSINCERITY IRASCIBILITY ON INSUFFICIENT CAUSE AND RESENTMENT DISPROPORTIONED TO THE PROVOCATION THE LOVE OF DOMINEERING OVER OTHERS THE DESIRE TO ENGROSS MORE THAN ONE'S SHARE OF ADVANTAGES
BUT WITHOUT DWELLING UPON SUPPOSITITIOUS CASES THERE ARE IN OUR OWN DAY GROSS USURPATIONS UPON THE LIBERTY OF PRIVATE LIFE ACTUALLY PRACTISED AND STILL GREATER ONES THREATENED WITH SOME EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS
THIS IS NEITHER POSSIBLE NOR DESIRABLE IF HE IS EMINENT IN ANY OF THE QUALITIES WHICH CONDUCE TO HIS OWN GOOD HE IS SO FAR A PROPER OBJECT OF ADMIRATION HE IS SO MUCH THE NEARER TO THE IDEAL PERFECTION OF HUMAN NATURE
FLYING FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY BEFORE THE CALIPHS ARRIVED IN WESTERN INDIA THEY WERE ADMITTED TO TOLERATION BY THE HINDOO SOVEREIGNS ON CONDITION OF NOT EATING BEEF
THAT THIS RELIGION LIKE OTHER AND BETTER RELIGIONS HAS ITS MARTYRS THAT ITS PROPHET AND FOUNDER WAS FOR HIS TEACHING PUT TO DEATH BY A MOB THAT OTHERS OF ITS ADHERENTS LOST THEIR LIVES BY THE SAME LAWLESS VIOLENCE
AND I DO NOT SEE HOW THOSE WHO BELIEVE THIS CAN THINK OTHERWISE THAN THAT THE EXAMPLE ON THE WHOLE MUST BE MORE SALUTARY THAN HURTFUL SINCE IF IT DISPLAYS THE MISCONDUCT
AND HOWEVER SURPRISING THIS FACT MAY APPEAR IT HAS ITS EXPLANATION IN THE COMMON IDEAS AND CUSTOMS OF THE WORLD WHICH TEACHING WOMEN TO THINK MARRIAGE THE ONE THING NEEDFUL MAKE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT MANY A WOMAN SHOULD PREFER BEING ONE OF SEVERAL WIVES
THERE ARE STILL IN THIS COUNTRY LARGE BODIES OF PERSONS BY WHOSE NOTIONS OF MORALITY AND RELIGION THESE RECREATIONS ARE CONDEMNED AND THOSE PERSONS BELONGING CHIEFLY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS
AND ITS BEST EFFORTS ARE NOT ALWAYS IN INDIVIDUAL CASES ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL ONES BUT IT IS PERFECTLY WELL ABLE TO MAKE THE RISING GENERATION AS A WHOLE AS GOOD AS AND A LITTLE BETTER THAN ITSELF
THAT THEY WERE FORCIBLY EXPELLED IN A BODY FROM THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY FIRST GREW UP WHILE NOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CHASED INTO A SOLITARY RECESS IN THE MIDST OF A DESERT MANY IN THIS COUNTRY OPENLY DECLARE THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT ONLY THAT IT IS NOT CONVENIENT
IT IS NOT LONG BEFORE PEOPLE SNEAK UP TO THEM UNDER THE PRETENCE OF WISHING TO FURTHER THOSE SPECIAL ENDS WHILE THEY ARE REALLY LED ON BY THE DESIRE TO SECURE THE EMOLUMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN LEFT FOR THEIR FURTHERANCE
A LITTLE BEFORE THOU DIDST BEGIN WITH HAPPINESS AND SAY IT WAS THE SUPREME GOOD AND DIDST DECLARE IT TO BE SEATED IN THE SUPREME GODHEAD GOD HIMSELF TOO
THOU HONEY OF MY HEART BITE MY FISHING HOOK INTO THE BELLY OF ALL BLACK AFFLICTION LOOK OUT LOOK OUT MINE EYE OH HOW MANY SEAS ROUND ABOUT ME WHAT DAWNING HUMAN FUTURES
IN HIS OWN BOSOM RAGED THE MUSIC THAT COULD CALM ALL ELSE BROUGHT HIM NO BALM CHIDING THE POWERS IMMORTAL HE CAME UNTO HELL'S PORTAL
AND FROM THIS THOU DIDST GO ON TO ADD AS BY THE WAY THE PROOF THAT NO ONE WOULD BE HAPPY UNLESS HE WERE LIKEWISE GOD AGAIN THOU DIDST SAY THAT THE VERY FORM OF GOOD WAS THE ESSENCE BOTH OF GOD
YE WAGS ANSWERED ZARATHUSTRA AND SMILED HOW WELL DID YE CHOOSE THE SIMILE BUT YE KNOW ALSO THAT MY HAPPINESS IS HEAVY
FOR SUCH IS THE FORM OF THE DIVINE ESSENCE THAT NEITHER CAN IT PASS INTO THINGS EXTERNAL NOR TAKE UP ANYTHING EXTERNAL INTO ITSELF BUT AS PARMENIDES SAYS OF IT
BY THE BLESSING OF GOD WHOM WE LATELY ADDRESSED IN PRAYER
HE WILL NEED NO EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE RULING OF THE WORLD OTHERWISE IF HE STANDS IN NEED OF AUGHT HE WILL NOT POSSESS COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE THAT IS NECESSARILY SO SAID I THEN
OF WHAT ACCOUNT IS MY HAPPINESS ANSWERED HE I HAVE LONG CEASED TO STRIVE ANY MORE FOR HAPPINESS I STRIVE FOR MY WORK O ZARATHUSTRA SAID THE ANIMALS ONCE MORE
A FEW PARABLES IN A FIELD OF RIPENING CORN I CAME TO A PLACE WHICH HAD BEEN TRAMPLED DOWN BY SOME RUTHLESS FOOT
A WIDE SPREADING APPLE TREE STOOD IN FULL BLOOM AND BEHIND IT A STRAIGHT FIR RAISED ITS DARK AND TAPERING HEAD
WHICH ONLY THOSE WILL UNDERSTAND WHO FEEL THE TRUTH OF IT YOUR ESTIMATION OF A MAN'S SIZE WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE DISTANCE AT WHICH YOU STAND FROM HIM
AND HE HEEDED IT NOT HIS HAIR HOWEVER BECAME WHITE ONE DAY WHEN HE SAT ON A STONE IN FRONT OF HIS CAVE AND GAZED CALMLY INTO THE DISTANCE ONE THERE GAZETH
WHICH ARE ALWAYS SELFISH AND MATERIAL EVERY HERO IS A SAMSON THE STRONG MAN SUCCUMBS TO THE INTRIGUES OF THE WEAK
AS YET DO I NOT MYSELF GO DOWN AS I MUST DO AMONGST MEN THEREFORE DO I HERE WAIT CRAFTY AND SCORNFUL UPON HIGH MOUNTAINS NO IMPATIENT ONE
OR DOTH IT SIT BEHIND A BIG STONE AND CATCH FLIES AND VERILY I AM WELL DISPOSED TO MINE ETERNAL FATE BECAUSE IT DOTH NOT HOUND AND HURRY ME BUT LEAVETH ME TIME FOR MERRIMENT AND MISCHIEF
TAKES VERY DIFFERENT SHAPES ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES BUT AT BOTTOM HE IS A MAN WHO CARES NOTHING ABOUT KNOWLEDGE FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND ONLY STRIVES TO GAIN THE SEMBLANCE OF IT THAT HE MAY USE IT FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL ENDS
UNTO THE CLEARER DAY IF ON THE DARKNESS PAST ONE BACKWARD LOOK YE CAST YOUR WEAK AND WANDERING EYES
THE VULTURE TOO DOTH SPARE SOME LITTLE WHILE TO TEAR
BY HIS OWN POWER ALONE HE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IT CANNOT BE DENIED NOW GOD WAS PROVED TO BE ABSOLUTE GOOD
AND OF HAPPINESS AND DIDST TEACH THAT THE ABSOLUTE ONE WAS THE ABSOLUTE GOOD WHICH WAS SOUGHT BY UNIVERSAL NATURE
AND IF I HAVE ALSO EMPLOYED REASONINGS NOT DRAWN FROM WITHOUT BUT LYING WITHIN THE COMPASS OF OUR SUBJECT THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR THEE TO MARVEL SINCE THOU HAST LEARNT ON PLATO'S AUTHORITY THAT WORDS OUGHT TO BE AKIN TO THE MATTER OF WHICH THEY TREAT
AND WHEN IT HAD ONCE COME TOGETHER
THERE ARE SOME REALLY BEAUTIFULLY LANDSCAPES IN THE WORLD BUT THE HUMAN FIGURES IN THEM ARE POOR AND YOU HAD NOT BETTER LOOK AT THEM
THIS IS ESPECIALLY ILLUSTRATED AND CORROBORATED IN THE CASE OF INSTITUTIONS WHETHER GREAT OR SMALL WEALTHY OR POOR FOUNDED NO MATTER IN WHAT CENTURY OR IN WHAT LAND TO MAINTAIN AND ADVANCE HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
AND ABOVE ME WHAT ROSY RED STILLNESS
FOR THAT DO I WAIT THE WICKEDEST OF ALL FISH CATCHERS OUT OUT MY FISHING HOOK IN AND DOWN THOU BAIT OF MY HAPPINESS DRIP THY SWEETEST DEW
THEN AFTER THROUGH THE STRESS OF HEAVY GRIEF THEN SHE CONTINUED IF THOU WILT REFLECT UPON THY FORMER ADMISSIONS IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE THOU DOST ALSO RECOLLECT THAT OF WHICH
NO ONE AT ALL CAN QUESTION IT WHO THINKS CONSISTENTLY NOW THERE IS NOTHING WHICH ONE WHO IS ALL POWERFUL CANNOT DO NOTHING BUT CAN GOD DO EVIL THEN
ITS COLOR AND PERFUME ARE DELIGHTFUL BUT IT WITHERS AWAY AND LEAVES NO SEED NO ROSE WITHOUT A THORN YES BUT MANY A THORN WITHOUT A ROSE
YOU HAVE THE ASTRONOMER AND THE PHILOSOPHER WISDOM WHICH IS ONLY THEORETICAL AND NEVER PUT INTO PRACTICE IS LIKE A DOUBLE ROSE
EVEN NOW A CHILD OF NATURE SOMETIMES SEES THEM SOME ONE WHO HAS NOT ANTICIPATED HIS AESTHETIC PLEASURES BY THE HELP OF ART OR TAKEN THE CHARMS OF LIFE TOO EARLY
ONE OF THEM DID NOTHING BUT STUDY THE MACHINERY AND HE SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT HOW IT WAS WORKED THE OTHER TRIED TO GET AT THE MEANING OF THE PIECE IN SPITE OF HIS IGNORANCE OF THE LANGUAGE HERE
PEOPLE COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS WANTING TO FIND IN IT SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE FOR THEMSELVES THEY STAND IN THE WAY AND SPOIL ITS EFFECT TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING SURPRISING IN THIS
THAT WE SHOULD NOT ENJOY IT ALL AT ONCE AND IN LARGE QUANTITIES WE SHOULD HAVE NO FINISHED PICTURES NO PERFECT POEMS BUT WE SHOULD LOOK AT ALL THINGS IN THAT GENIAL AND PLEASING LIGHT IN WHICH
NAY BY NO MEANS THEN EVIL IS NOTHING SAID SHE SINCE HE TO WHOM NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE IS UNABLE TO DO EVIL ART THOU MOCKING ME SAID I
THAT IS TO SAY OUR GREAT REMOTE HUMAN KINGDOM THE ZARATHUSTRA KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS HOW REMOTE MAY SUCH REMOTENESS BE WHAT DOTH IT CONCERN ME
WHILE IT FOLLOWS NATURE ENDEAVOURS TO RESIST GOOD NO NOTHING BUT IF ANYTHING SHOULD WILL IT HAVE THE LEAST SUCCESS AGAINST HIM WHOM WE RIGHTLY AGREED TO BE SUPREME LORD OF HAPPINESS
FOR IN A WORLD OF NEED AND IMPERFECTION EVERYTHING IS SEIZED UPON WHICH CAN BE USED TO SATISFY WANT NOTHING IS EXEMPT FROM THIS SERVICE NO
EVERY ONE OF THEM ALIKE STANDING THERE SO ERECT AND BEARING THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE EAR
BUT WHEN WINTER COMES YOU WILL BE BARED OF YOUR GLORY AND I SHALL BE AS I AM NOW ONCE AS I WAS BOTANIZING UNDER AN OAK
THOU HUMAN ABYSS OPEN UP AND THROW UNTO ME THY FISH AND SHINING CRABS WITH MY BEST BAIT SHALL I ALLURE TO MYSELF TO DAY THE STRANGEST HUMAN FISH
WERE THERE NOT ONE WHO KEEPS TOGETHER WHAT HE HAS JOINED NOR WOULD THE ORDER OF NATURE PROCEED SO REGULARLY NOR COULD ITS COURSE EXHIBIT MOTIONS SO FIXED IN RESPECT OF POSITION TIME RANGE EFFICACY
THEN HE DISPOSES ALL THINGS BY THE AGENCY OF GOOD IF IT BE TRUE THAT HE RULES ALL THINGS BY HIS OWN POWER WHOM WE HAVE AGREED TO BE GOOD AND HE IS AS IT WERE THE RUDDER AND HELM BY WHICH THE WORLD'S MECHANISM IS KEPT STEADY AND IN ORDER
WOE UNTO ALL LOVING ONES WHO HAVE NOT AN ELEVATION WHICH IS ABOVE THEIR PITY THUS SPAKE THE DEVIL UNTO ME ONCE ON A TIME
A NUMBER OF PORCUPINES HUDDLED TOGETHER FOR WARMTH ON A COLD DAY IN WINTER BUT AS THEY BEGAN TO PRICK ONE ANOTHER WITH THEIR QUILLS
THE MAN WHO GOES UP IN A BALLOON DOES NOT FEEL AS THOUGH HE WERE ASCENDING HE ONLY SEES THE EARTH SINKING DEEPER UNDER HIM THERE IS A MYSTERY
RED AND BLUE AND VIOLET HOW PRETTY THEY LOOKED AS THEY GREW THERE SO NATURALLY WITH THEIR LITTLE FOLIAGE BUT THOUGHT I THEY ARE QUITE USELESS THEY BEAR NO FRUIT THEY ARE MERE WEEDS
IT IS CONSEQUENTLY FOR THAT REASON THAT THOU THYSELF ALWAYS BECOMETH YELLOWER AND DARKER ALTHOUGH THY HAIR LOOKETH WHITE AND FLAXEN
BUT LET US GIVE OUR ATTENTION TO THE TASK THAT WE HAVE SET BEFORE OURSELVES HAVE WE NOT COUNTED INDEPENDENCE IN THE CATEGORY OF HAPPINESS AND AGREED THAT GOD IS ABSOLUTE HAPPINESS TRULY WE HAVE THEN
A POSTURING WRATH SNORTER WITH WAITING A HOLY HOWL STORM FROM THE MOUNTAINS AN IMPATIENT ONE THAT SHOUTETH DOWN INTO THE VALLEYS HEARKEN ELSE I WILL SCOURGE YOU WITH THE SCOURGE OF GOD
ALLURE FOR ME WITH THY GLITTERING THE FINEST HUMAN FISH AND WHATEVER BELONGETH UNTO ME IN ALL SEAS MY IN AND FOR ME IN ALL THINGS FISH THAT OUT FOR ME
AND THUS TO SATISFY CERTAIN COARSE AND BRUTAL INSTINCTS OF THEIR OWN THUS IT IS THAT WE COME TO HAVE SO MANY CHARLATANS IN EVERY BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE THE CHARLATAN
ONCE ON A TIME BECOME WHAT THOU ART THUS MAY MEN NOW COME UP TO ME FOR AS YET DO I AWAIT THE SIGNS THAT IT IS TIME FOR MY DOWN GOING
WITHOUT DISMAY BESIDE THE LION LAY THE HOUND BY SONG SUBDUED NO MORE THE HARE PURSUED
BUT MOST OF ALL AT THESE VERY WORDS WHICH THOU USEST I AM NOW AT LAST ASHAMED OF THE FOLLY THAT SO SORELY VEXED ME THOU HAST HEARD THE STORY OF THE GIANTS ASSAILING HEAVEN
CAN LOVERS MOVE A HIGHER LAW IS LOVE FOR ORPHEUS WOE IS ME
THOU DIDST UNFOLD WITHOUT THE HELP OF ASSUMPTIONS FROM WITHOUT BUT BY INHERENT AND PROPER PROOFS DRAWING CREDENCE ONE FROM THE OTHER THEN ANSWERED SHE FAR IS IT FROM ME TO MOCK THEE NAY
BUT ON THAT ACCOUNT IT IS NONE THE LESS SURE UNTO ME WITH BOTH FEET STAND I SECURE ON THIS GROUND ON AN ETERNAL GROUND
SINCE GOD IS RIGHTLY BELIEVED TO GOVERN ALL THINGS WITH THE RUDDER OF GOODNESS AND SINCE ALL THINGS DO LIKEWISE AS I HAVE TAUGHT HASTE TOWARDS GOOD BY THE VERY AIM OF NATURE CAN IT BE DOUBTED THAT HIS GOVERNANCE IS WILLINGLY ACCEPTED
AS THE ECHOES WAKEN ALL TAENARUS IS SHAKEN WHILST HE TO RUTH PERSUADES
IS THE CODE OF POLITENESS AND FINE MANNERS AND THOSE WHO TRANSGRESS IT ARE ROUGHLY TOLD IN THE ENGLISH PHRASE TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE BY THIS ARRANGEMENT
PAINTERS AND POETS LAY THEMSELVES OUT TO TAKE OFF THIS VARNISH TO STORE IT UP AND GIVE IT US TO BE ENJOYED AT OUR LEISURE WE DRINK DEEP OF THIS BEAUTY
THUS IT IS THAT THE WORLD SO OFTEN APPEARS HARSH AND DEVOID OF CHARM NAY ACTUALLY REPULSIVE IT WERE BETTER TO LEAVE US TO DISCOVER THE VARNISH FOR OURSELVES THIS WOULD MEAN
THOU NOW BRINGEST TO THE SEARCH EYES QUICKER IN DISCERNING TRUTH BUT WHAT I SHALL SAY NEXT IS NO LESS PLAIN AND EASY TO SEE WHAT IS IT SAID I WHY SAID SHE
ERSTWHILE THOU DIDST CONFESS THYSELF IGNORANT WHAT IS THAT SAID I THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WORLD'S GOVERNMENT SAID SHE YES I REMEMBER MY CONFESSION AND
POETRY AND ART WHICH IN CIVIC LIFE SO SEVERE BUT STILL USEFUL AND NOT WITHOUT ITS FRUIT PLAY THE SAME PART AS FLOWERS IN THE CORN
AND BEEN WELL PAID FOR MY HELP THE FIRST TIME WAS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOUDHAMPTON HEARTH AND HOME MUTUAL BENEFIT SOCIETY AFFAIR AYLMORE OR AINSWORTH WAS AS INNOCENT
AND HE PAID US WHO HELPED HIM GENEROUSLY AS I'VE TOLD YOU THE THING COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BETTER DONE WHEN IT WAS DONE THE NEPHEW DISAPPEARED THE DOCTOR DISAPPEARED
AND LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW THE BLANK ASTONISHMENT WHICH STOLE OVER HIS HEARERS FACES
AND WILL FURTHER GIVE FULL INFORMATION AS TO HIS OR HER DISPOSAL OF THE SAME AND THE PROPRIETOR OF THE WATCHMAN MOREOVER ENGAGES
SAID SPARGO CONFIDENTLY THERE IS MORE MAGIC IN A THOUSAND POUND REWARD THAN YOU FANCY BRETON I'LL HAVE THE HISTORY OF THAT STICK BEFORE MIDNIGHT HOW ARE YOU TO TELL
WHEREAS ON SOME DATE WITHIN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS THERE WAS STOLEN ABSTRACTED OR TAKEN FROM THE CHAMBERS IN FOUNTAIN COURT TEMPLE
I SAID NOBODY KNEW AS MUCH OF THIS AFFAIR AS I KNOW AND THAT'S TRUE ALSO AND HERE'S THE TRUTH OF WHAT I KNOW
OF THAT THE DAY AFTER THE MURDER THEN FOR PURPOSES OF MY OWN I WENT TO SCOTLAND YARD AS SPARGO THERE IS AWARE YOU SEE I WAS PLAYING A GAME AND IT REQUIRED SOME INGENUITY
ONE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING AT ONCE AND IN CASH TO WHOSOEVER WILL PROVE THAT HE OR SHE STOLE ABSTRACTED OR TOOK AWAY THE SAID STICK FROM THE SAID CHAMBERS
DON'T YOU SEE THE OLD CHAP'S DONE UP THEY'RE BOTH DONE UP WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH WITH THIS FELLOW BEFORE WE CAME AND IT'S CERTAIN THEY'VE HAD NO SLEEP LEAVE IT ALL TILL LATER
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THE ACTUAL MURDER FOR I DO KNOW A GOOD DEAL ABOUT IT THOUGH
YOU CAN PROVE ALL THIS I SUPPOSE REMARKED SPARGO EVERY WORD EVERY LETTER BUT ABOUT THE MARKET MILCASTER AFFAIR YOUR FATHER
WE'RE TAKING THAT FOR GRANTED SAID SPARGO WE GUESSED AS MUCH WHEN WE FOUND YOU HERE YOU'LL HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPLANATION YOU KNOW LATER ON
MAKE SOME HOT COFFEE WHILE I OPEN ONE OF THESE TINS THE PRISONER WATCHED THE PREPARATIONS FOR A ROUGH AND READY BREAKFAST WITH EYES THAT EVENTUALLY BEGAN TO GLISTEN
NOW FIRST
THEN BRETON NODDED LET HIM TALK IF HE LIKES HE SAID WE'RE NOT BOUND TO BELIEVE HIM AND WE MAY HEAR SOMETHING THAT'S TRUE
REPLIED MYERST AND I WAS GLAD TO TAKE IT AND NATURALLY I GAINED A CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF HIM HE HAD ONLY ONE FRIEND MISTER ELPHICK IN THERE NOW
FOR PERMISSION TO OPEN THE CHAMBERLAYNE GRAVE AT MARKET MILCASTER THE SECOND WAS THAT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THERE APPEARED IN THE WATCHMAN
INSTEAD OF GOING ABROAD THE OLD FOX THOUGH HE WAS A COMPARATIVELY YOUNG UN THEN HAD SHAVED OFF HIS BEARD SETTLED DOWN IN THE TEMPLE AND GIVEN HIMSELF UP TO HIS TWO HOBBIES COLLECTING CURIOSITIES AND STAMPS
BOUGHT IT THERE AND THEN AND HOW MUCH DID HE GIVE YOU FOR IT ASKED SPARGO SOMETHING HANDSOME I HOPE COUPLE O QUID REPLIED MOLLISON
I DO NOT KNOW WHO KILLED JOHN MAITLAND THAT'S A FACT IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE OLD MAN IN THERE WHO'S ALREADY AT HIS OWN LAST GASP OR IT MAYN'T
I TOOK IT WITH ME YOU TOOK IT WITH YOU SAID SPARGO JUST SO TO KEEP AS A CURIOSITY I SUPPOSE MOLLISON'S WEAK SMILE TURNED TO ONE OF CUNNING
SAID BRETON YOU'VE EXTORTED MONEY BY MENACES FROM THESE GENTLEMEN AT ANY RATE HAVE I HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T ENTRUST ME WITH THESE CHEQUES AS THEIR AGENT
WHEN I TOOK THE STICK AWAY SEE I SEE AND YOU TOOK THE STICK TO HIM I TOOK IT THERE AND THEN REPLIED MOLLISON PITCHED HIM A TALE I DID
HE'S GOT A BUNDLE OF STICKS AND WALKING CANES UP THERE HELL NEVER MISS THIS OLD THING I THINKS AND SO I LEFT IT IN A CORNER WHEN I'D DONE BEATING THE RUGS AND WHEN I WENT AWAY WITH MY THINGS
WITH A LOOK OF CONCERN I SAY HE EXCLAIMED HE'S MORE THAN FRIGHTENED HE'S ILL WHAT'S TO BE DONE I ASKED THE POLICE TO BRING A DOCTOR ALONG WITH THEM ANSWERED BRETON
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY LOSING HIS NERVOUSNESS THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE AND THE RECEPTION OF HIS NEWS WAS IMPARTING CONFIDENCE TO HIM NOT HALF HE ANSWERED YOU SEE GUV'NOR
I'VE GOT ALL THE CONTENTS OF THAT LEATHER BOX WHICH MAITLAND DEPOSITED WITH ME THAT'S SAFELY LOCKED UP TOO AND AT YOUR DISPOSAL I TOOK POSSESSION
BY UNCLE SIMON WHICH I NEVER HAD NO UNCLE SIMON MADE OUT IT WAS A RARE CURIOSITY
HE LIVED SUCH A QUIET SECLUDED LIFE WITH HIS COLLECTIONS HIS OLD PORT AND HIS LITTLE WHIMS AND FADS BUT I KNEW HIM
WHICH STICK WAS PROBABLY USED IN THE MURDER OF JOHN MARBURY OR MAITLAND IN MIDDLE TEMPLE LANE
A DOCTOR OF NO REPUTATION AND MYSELF WE CARRIED IT OUT VERY CLEVERLY AND CHAMBERLAYNE GAVE US FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS APIECE FOR OUR TROUBLE IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAD HELPED HIM
WAS THAT ALL THREE DROVE TO THE OFFICES OF THE LEGAL GENTLEMAN WHO CATERED FOR THE WATCHMAN WHEN IT WANTED ANY LAW AND THAT THINGS WERE PUT IN SHAPE FOR AN IMMEDIATE APPLICATION TO THE HOME OFFICE
AND THAT IT GOT INTO THE HANDS OF YES OF WHOM THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IN SOME FASHION I'VE AN IDEA ALREADY BUT I CAN AFFORD TO WAIT FOR DEFINITE INFORMATION
TO TREAT ANY REVELATION AFFECTING THE SAID STICK IN THE MOST STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL MANNER AND TO ABSTAIN FROM USING IT IN ANY WAY DETRIMENTAL TO THE INFORMANT
WHEN WHEN YOU CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE STICK WE'VE BEEN ADVERTISING ABOUT SUGGESTED SPARGO JUST SO WELL MOLLISON WHAT ABOUT THE STICK
AND IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE POLICE THIS IS TO GIVE NOTICE THAT THE PROPRIETOR OF THE WATCHMAN NEWSPAPER WILL PAY THE ABOVE MENTIONED REWARD
AND THEM WINDOWS AT MISTER AYLMORE'S ONLY I KNEW THEM AS MISTER ANDERSON'S AMONG EM AND I WAS THERE ONE MORNING EARLY IT WAS
AND PROVE THAT IT IS THE TRUTH
MYERST TOOK A STIFF PULL AT THE CONTENTS OF THE TUMBLER
IN THE MEANTIME LET'S PUT HIM TO BED THERE ARE BEDS IN THAT INNER ROOM WE'LL GET HIM TO BED AND GIVE HIM SOMETHING HOT TO DRINK THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK OF FOR THE PRESENT BETWEEN THEM THEY MANAGED TO GET
WHAT THEN MOLLISON SMILED HIS WEAK SMILE AGAIN WELL SIR I LOOKED AT THAT THERE STICK AND I SEE IT WAS SOMETHING UNCOMMON HE ANSWERED AND I THINKS
AFTER ALL WE'VE FOUND THEM AND WE'VE FOUND HIM HE JERKED HIS THUMB OVER HIS SHOULDER IN MYERST'S DIRECTION AND BRETON INVOLUNTARILY FOLLOWED THE MOVEMENT
AND FRIGHT CARDLESTONE STILL SAT IN HIS CORNER SHIVERING AND TREMBLING HE LOOKED INCAPABLE OF EXPLAINING ANYTHING ELPHICK WAS SCARCELY MORE FITTED TO SPEAK
NOT THE SLIGHTEST DANGER IN THE WORLD MOLLISON REPLIED SPARGO NOT THE LEAST
SHALL YOU GO ASKED BRETON CERTAINLY AND YOU CAN GO WITH ME IF YOU LIKE BETTER KEEP IN TOUCH WITH US ALL DAY IN CASE WE HEAR YOU OUGHT TO BE THERE YOU'RE CONCERNED I SHOULD LIKE TO GO
AND WHAT WAS DONE WITH THE STICK SAID SPARGO I HAVEN'T THE LEAST DOUBT THAT THAT STICK WAS STOLEN OR TAKEN AWAY FROM AYLMORE'S ROOMS IN FOUNTAIN COURT
WE'LL GO AND SEE ABOUT YOUR LITTLE REWARD EXCUSE ME BRETON BRETON KICKED HIS HEELS IN SOLITUDE FOR HALF AN HOUR THEN SPARGO CAME BACK THERE
CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE MYERST EXPLAINS IT HAD BEEN APPARENT TO SPARGO FROM THE MOMENT OF HIS ENTERING THE COTTAGE THAT THE TWO OLD MEN WERE SUFFERING BADLY FROM SHOCK
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING ON A STRAIGHT LINE TRYING TO YOU MEAN RETORTED SPARGO WELL STOP HERE AND HEAR WHAT THIS CHAP HAS TO SAY IT'LL NO DOUBT BE AMUSING THE MESSENGER BOY
WHICH THEY'VE PAINTED ON HIS ENTRY THE FIFTH OR SIXTH AS YOU GO DOWN MIDDLE TEMPLE LANE ANSWERED MOLLISON MISTER NICHOLAS CARDLESTONE FIRST FLOOR UP THE STAIRCASE
WHO SHOULD CALL AT THE WATCHMAN OFFICE AND ASK FOR MISTER FRANK SPARGO AT ANY TIME BETWEEN ELEVEN AND ONE O'CLOCK MIDDAY AND SEVEN AND ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
THAN I KNOW OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN
I HELPED TO CARRY OUT HIS MOCK DEATH AND BURIAL I WAS A SOLICITOR IN THOSE DAYS AND MY NAME WAS SOMETHING ELSE THERE WERE THREE OF US AT IT CHAMBERLAYNE'S NEPHEW
HIS COUNTENANCE USUALLY SUBDUED TO AN OFFICIAL STOLIDITY SHOWED SIGNS OF SOMETHING VERY LIKE EXCITEMENT
GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU PLEASE YOU SHAN'T STARVE SAID BRETON CARELESSLY HE CUT AN AMPLE SUPPLY OF BREAD AND MEAT FILLED A CUP WITH COFFEE AND PLACED CUP AND PLATE BEFORE MYERST
WAIT UNTIL WE SEE IF THAT COFFIN CONTAINS A DEAD BODY OR LEAD AND SAWDUST IF THERE'S NO BODY THERE AT THAT MOMENT ONE OF THE SENIOR MESSENGER BOYS CAME IN AND APPROACHED SPARGO
DEEPLY CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS USHERING INTO SPARGO'S ROOM AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MIGHT SHORTLY CARRY AWAY A THOUSAND POUNDS OF GOOD WATCHMAN MONEY IN HIS POCKET OPENED THE DOOR AND INTRODUCED A SHY AND SELF CONSCIOUS YOUNG MAN
WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK LOOK HERE I'LL MAKE YOU A FAIR OFFER THERE ARE SOME CIGARS IN MY CASE THERE GIVE ME ONE AND MIX ME A DRINK OF THAT WHISKY A GOOD UN AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THIS MATTER COME ON
SPARGO ROSE FROM HIS SEAT WITHOUT AS MUCH AS A LOOK AT BRETON
AFTER I BECAME SECRETARY TO THE SAFE DEPOSIT COMPANY I TOOK CHAMBERS IN THE TEMPLE ABOVE CARDLESTONE'S AND I SPEEDILY FOUND OUT WHO HE WAS
ANSWERED EDWARD MOLLISON LEASTWAYS THAT'S WHERE I GENERALLY HANG OUT WHEN I CAN AFFORD IT AND WINDOW CLEANER LEASTWAYS I WAS WINDOW CLEANING WHEN
IT NOT ME AND AS YOU MIGHT SAY I DIDN'T TAKE IT WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE IT WAS PUT ON ME PUT ON YOU WAS IT SAID SPARGO
THERE'S NO REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T TELL THE TRUTH THE FACT IS I'VE NOTHING TO FEAR YOU CAN'T GIVE ME IN CHARGE FOR IT SO HAPPENS THAT I'VE GOT A POWER OF ATTORNEY
ELPHICK I GATHER TOOK FRIGHT FROM YOU AND WENT TO CARDLESTONE THEN THEY BOTH VANISHED IT MAY BE THAT CARDLESTONE DID KILL MAITLAND I DON'T KNOW
HE LOOKED SCRUTINIZINGLY AT HIS TWO CAPTORS LOOK HERE HE SAID YOU THINK YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT ALL THIS AFFAIR SPARGO BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT THAT'S ME
AND THAT'S HOW I CAME TO HANDLE IT SIR I SEE SAID SPARGO A GOOD EXPLANATION
THAT YOU WON'T BE IMPOSED UPON SUGGESTED BRETON ANYBODY CAN SAY THAT HE OR SHE STOLE THE STICK WHOEVER COMES HERE WITH ANY TALE OF A STICK
BUT NOT SO LITTLE IF THAT WAS TO BE MICHAEL'S LAST NIGHT IN THE NURSERY THEY GO ON WITH THEIR RECOLLECTIONS IT WAS THEN THAT I RUSHED IN LIKE A TORNADO WASN'T IT MISTER DARLING WOULD SAY SCORNING HIMSELF AND INDEED HE HAD BEEN LIKE A TORNADO
DEAR NO BEGS TO BE EXCUSED HE THOUGHT MISSUS DARLING WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMPRESSED AND HE WENT ON STERNLY I WARN YOU OF THIS MOTHER THAT UNLESS THIS TIE IS ROUND MY NECK WE DON'T GO OUT TO DINNER TO NIGHT AND IF I DON'T GO OUT TO DINNER TO NIGHT
HE SAID EXAMINING IT CAREFULLY BUT IT DOES LOOK A SCOUNDREL WE WERE STILL DISCUSSING IT YOU REMEMBER SAYS MISTER DARLING WHEN NANA CAME IN WITH MICHAEL'S MEDICINE
YOU SEE I DON'T KNOW ANY STORIES NONE OF THE LOST BOYS KNOWS ANY STORIES HOW PERFECTLY AWFUL WENDY SAID DO YOU KNOW PETER ASKED WHY SWALLOWS BUILD IN THE EAVES OF HOUSES IT IS TO LISTEN TO THE STORIES O WENDY YOUR MOTHER WAS TELLING YOU SUCH A LOVELY STORY
UNFORTUNATELY LIZA RETURNED TO HER PUDDINGS AND NANA SEEING THAT NO HELP WOULD COME FROM HER
SURELY YOU KNOW WHAT A KISS IS SHE ASKED AGHAST
HE LURED HER OUT OF IT WITH HONEYED WORDS AND SEIZING HER ROUGHLY DRAGGED HER FROM THE NURSERY
HE ROARED WHILE SHE COMFORTED HER BOYS AND WENDY HUGGED NANA MUCH GOOD HE SAID BITTERLY MY WEARING MYSELF TO THE BONE TRYING TO BE FUNNY IN THIS HOUSE AND STILL WENDY HUGGED NANA
BOY SHE SAID COURTEOUSLY
WHEN MICHAEL DODGED THE SPOON IN NANA'S MOUTH HE HAD SAID REPROVINGLY
OH DEAR SAID THE NICE WENDY I DON'T MEAN A KISS I MEAN A THIMBLE WHAT'S THAT IT'S LIKE THIS SHE KISSED HIM FUNNY SAID PETER GRAVELY NOW SHALL I GIVE YOU A THIMBLE IF YOU WISH TO SAID WENDY KEEPING HER HEAD ERECT THIS TIME
HE WISHED SHE HAD NOT MENTIONED LETTERS DON'T GET ANY LETTERS HE SAID CONTEMPTUOUSLY BUT YOUR MOTHER GETS LETTERS DON'T HAVE A MOTHER HE SAID NOT ONLY HAD HE NO MOTHER BUT HE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST DESIRE TO HAVE ONE HE THOUGHT THEM VERY OVER RATED PERSONS
THE SOUND CAME FROM THE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND PETER MADE A MERRY FACE
WENDY LOVED TO LEND HER BRACELET TO HER MOTHER
FOR IT WAS AFTERWARDS TO SAVE HER LIFE WHEN PEOPLE IN OUR SET ARE INTRODUCED IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR THEM TO ASK EACH OTHER'S AGE AND SO WENDY WHO ALWAYS LIKED TO DO THE CORRECT THING ASKED PETER HOW OLD HE WAS
DO YOU REALLY THINK SO PETER YES I DO
LET THEM HE ANSWERED RECKLESSLY BRING IN THE WHOLE WORLD BUT I REFUSE TO ALLOW THAT DOG TO LORD IT IN MY NURSERY FOR AN HOUR LONGER THE CHILDREN WEPT AND NANA RAN TO HIM BESEECHINGLY BUT HE WAVED HER BACK HE FELT HE WAS A STRONG MAN AGAIN
CUT LOW AND SQUARE THROUGH WHICH HER FIGURE COULD BE SEEN TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE
WITH A VINDICTIVE POLITENESS THAT WAS QUITE THROWN AWAY UPON HER MICHAEL FIRST HE SAID DOGGEDLY FATHER FIRST SAID MICHAEL WHO WAS OF A SUSPICIOUS NATURE I SHALL BE SICK YOU KNOW MISTER DARLING SAID THREATENINGLY
AGAIN MISSUS DARLING SCREAMED THIS TIME IN DISTRESS FOR HIM FOR SHE THOUGHT HE WAS KILLED AND SHE RAN DOWN INTO THE STREET TO LOOK FOR HIS LITTLE BODY BUT IT WAS NOT THERE AND SHE LOOKED UP AND IN THE BLACK NIGHT SHE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS A SHOOTING STAR
BUT SHE WAS EXULTING IN HIS IGNORANCE
IT WAS LIKE AN EXAMINATION PAPER THAT ASKS GRAMMAR WHEN WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ASKED IS KINGS OF ENGLAND I DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED UNEASILY BUT I AM QUITE YOUNG
FOR THE MOMENT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HIS IGNORANCE ABOUT KISSES I THOUGHT YOU WOULD WANT IT BACK HE SAID A LITTLE BITTERLY
BUT SHE DID NOT NOTICE THIS NOR THAT ONE OR TWO OF THE SMALLER ONES WINKED AT HER YET A NAMELESS FEAR CLUTCHED AT HER HEART AND MADE HER CRY
WHILE THE CHILDREN STOOD AROUND TO SEE THEIR FATE DECIDED SOME MEN WOULD HAVE RESENTED HER BEING ABLE TO DO IT SO EASILY BUT MISTER DARLING HAD FAR TOO FINE A NATURE FOR THAT HE THANKED HER CARELESSLY AT ONCE FORGOT HIS RAGE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT WAS DANCING ROUND THE ROOM
CERTAINLY SAID MISTER DARLING ARE YOU READY MICHAEL WENDY GAVE THE WORDS ONE TWO THREE AND MICHAEL TOOK HIS MEDICINE BUT MISTER DARLING SLIPPED HIS BEHIND HIS BACK
NOT ONE OF THEM COULD FLY AN INCH THOUGH EVEN MICHAEL WAS IN WORDS OF TWO SYLLABLES AND PETER DID NOT KNOW A FROM Z
THAT WANTED HER NOT TO CALL PETER NAMES THEY WOULD SIT THERE IN THE EMPTY NURSERY RECALLING FONDLY EVERY SMALLEST DETAIL OF THAT DREADFUL EVENING
BUT HE HAD NO PITY FOR HER WENDY HE SAID THE SLY ONE YOU COULD TUCK US IN AT NIGHT O O NONE OF US HAS EVER BEEN TUCKED IN AT NIGHT O O AND HER ARMS WENT OUT TO HIM AND YOU COULD DARN OUR CLOTHES AND MAKE POCKETS FOR US
SHE WAS MUCH PLEASED AND BOWED BEAUTIFULLY TO HIM FROM THE BED WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
MATTER HE YELLED HE REALLY YELLED THIS TIE IT WILL NOT TIE HE BECAME DANGEROUSLY SARCASTIC
SHE USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS TO HER HUSBAND WHILE PERHAPS NANA WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER HOLDING HER HAND NO NO MISTER DARLING ALWAYS SAID I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR IT ALL I GEORGE DARLING DID IT
HE HAD CLIMBED IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT TO THE TOP OF THE WARDROBE AND HIDDEN IT THERE
A SHUDDER PASSED THROUGH PETER AND HE SAT ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED HIS SOBS WOKE WENDY AND SHE SAT UP IN BED
THERE YOU SUSPICIOUS BRUTE SHE SAID NOT SORRY THAT NANA WAS IN DISGRACE THEY ARE PERFECTLY SAFE AREN'T THEY EVERY ONE OF THE LITTLE ANGELS SOUND ASLEEP IN BED LISTEN TO THEIR GENTLE BREATHING HERE MICHAEL ENCOURAGED BY HIS SUCCESS BREATHED SO LOUDLY THAT THEY WERE NEARLY DETECTED
HIS PROUD HEART WAS NEARLY BURSTING AND IT ISN'T FAIR
THEN JOHN WAS BORN WITH THE EXTRA POMP THAT HE CONCEIVED DUE TO THE BIRTH OF A MALE AND MICHAEL CAME FROM HIS BATH TO ASK TO BE BORN ALSO BUT JOHN SAID BRUTALLY THAT THEY DID NOT WANT ANY MORE MICHAEL HAD NEARLY CRIED NOBODY WANTS ME
IN VAIN IN VAIN HE CRIED THE PROPER PLACE FOR YOU IS THE YARD
SHE WAS HERE JUST NOW HE SAID A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY YOU DON'T HEAR HER DO YOU AND THEY BOTH LISTENED THE ONLY SOUND I HEAR SAID WENDY IS LIKE A TINKLE OF BELLS
I REMEMBER THEY WERE RATHER SWEET DON'T YOU THINK GEORGE AND THEY WERE OURS OURS AND NOW THEY ARE GONE THE ROMP HAD ENDED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF NANA AND MOST UNLUCKILY MISTER DARLING COLLIDED AGAINST HER COVERING HIS TROUSERS WITH HAIRS
THERE WAS A COMMOTION IN THE FIRMAMENT
GEORGE MISSUS DARLING ENTREATED HIM NOT SO LOUD THE SERVANTS WILL HEAR YOU SOMEHOW THEY HAD GOT INTO THE WAY
OF COURSE MISSUS DARLING BRUSHED HIM BUT HE BEGAN TO TALK AGAIN ABOUT ITS BEING A MISTAKE TO HAVE A DOG FOR A NURSE GEORGE NANA IS A TREASURE NO DOUBT BUT I HAVE AN UNEASY FEELING AT TIMES THAT SHE LOOKS UPON THE CHILDREN AS PUPPIES OH NO
THEY COULD NOT HELP KICKING A LITTLE BUT THEIR HEADS WERE BOBBING AGAINST THE CEILING AND THERE IS ALMOST NOTHING SO DELICIOUS AS THAT PETER GAVE WENDY A HAND AT FIRST BUT HAD TO DESIST TINK WAS SO INDIGNANT UP AND DOWN THEY WENT AND ROUND AND ROUND HEAVENLY WAS WENDY'S WORD
PETER PAN SHE WAS ALREADY SURE THAT HE MUST BE PETER BUT IT DID SEEM A COMPARATIVELY SHORT NAME IS THAT ALL YES HE SAID RATHER SHARPLY HE FELT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT IT WAS A SHORTISH NAME I'M SO SORRY SAID WENDY MOIRA ANGELA IT DOESN'T MATTER PETER GULPED
I FLEWED HE SCREAMED WHILE STILL IN MID AIR JOHN LET GO AND MET WENDY NEAR THE BATHROOM
WELL THEN YOU TAKE IT WENDY HAD A SPLENDID IDEA
IT MADE THIS LIGHT BY FLASHING ABOUT SO QUICKLY
HE THOUGHT HE HAD ATTACHED THE SHADOW HIMSELF HOW CLEVER I AM HE CROWED RAPTUROUSLY OH THE CLEVERNESS OF ME IT IS HUMILIATING TO HAVE TO CONFESS THAT THIS CONCEIT OF PETER WAS ONE OF HIS MOST FASCINATING QUALITIES
AND JOHN WAS SAYING I AM HAPPY TO INFORM YOU MISSUS DARLING THAT YOU ARE NOW A MOTHER IN JUST SUCH A TONE AS MISTER DARLING HIMSELF MAY HAVE USED ON THE REAL OCCASION WENDY HAD DANCED WITH JOY JUST AS THE REAL MISSUS DARLING MUST HAVE DONE
AT FIRST HE POOH POOHED THE STORY BUT HE BECAME THOUGHTFUL WHEN SHE SHOWED HIM THE SHADOW
AND USED A MADE UP TIE THIS WAS SUCH AN OCCASION HE CAME RUSHING INTO THE NURSERY WITH THE CRUMPLED LITTLE BRUTE OF A TIE IN HIS HAND
WAS WHAT NANA'S WET EYES SAID MY LIKING FOR PARTIES GEORGE MY FATAL GIFT OF HUMOUR DEAREST MY TOUCHINESS ABOUT TRIFLES DEAR MASTER AND MISTRESS
AS SOON AS NANA HAD GONE INTO THE BATHROOM
IT LOOKED SO LIKE THE WASHING AND LOWERED THE WHOLE TONE OF THE HOUSE SHE THOUGHT OF SHOWING IT TO MISTER DARLING BUT HE WAS TOTTING UP WINTER GREAT COATS FOR JOHN AND MICHAEL
TINK SAID THAT THE SHADOW WAS IN THE BIG BOX SHE MEANT THE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND PETER JUMPED AT THE DRAWERS SCATTERING THEIR CONTENTS TO THE FLOOR WITH BOTH HANDS AS KINGS TOSS HA'PENCE TO THE CROWD
SHE LOOKED OUT AND THE NIGHT WAS PEPPERED WITH STARS
MISTER DARLING WAS FRIGHTFULLY ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
HOWEVER JOHN CONTINUED TO SLEEP SO PLACIDLY ON THE FLOOR THAT SHE ALLOWED HIM TO REMAIN THERE AND I KNOW YOU MEANT TO BE KIND SHE SAID RELENTING
OH THE STORIES I COULD TELL TO THE BOYS SHE CRIED
WITH THE NECKLACE GEORGE HAD GIVEN HER
AND I'LL GET UP AGAIN AND SHE SAT WITH HIM ON THE SIDE OF THE BED
JOHN THERE JUST DESPISES US FOR REPLY PETER ROSE AND KICKED JOHN OUT OF BED BLANKETS AND ALL ONE KICK
HALLO HE SAID I AM UP MICHAEL WAS UP BY THIS TIME ALSO LOOKING AS SHARP AS A KNIFE WITH SIX BLADES AND A SAW BUT PETER SUDDENLY SIGNED SILENCE THEIR FACES ASSUMED THE AWFUL CRAFTINESS OF CHILDREN LISTENING FOR SOUNDS FROM THE GROWN UP WORLD ALL WAS AS STILL AS SALT THEN EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT
I NEVER GO TO THE OFFICE AGAIN AND IF I DON'T GO TO THE OFFICE AGAIN YOU AND I STARVE AND OUR CHILDREN WILL BE FLUNG INTO THE STREETS EVEN THEN MISSUS DARLING WAS PLACID LET ME TRY DEAR SHE SAID AND INDEED THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD COME TO ASK HER TO DO
WENDY HE SAID HOW WE SHOULD ALL RESPECT YOU
IT HAS COME OFF YES THEN WENDY SAW THE SHADOW ON THE FLOOR
TEDIOUS TALK THIS BUT BEING A STAY AT HOME SHE LIKED IT AND SO HE WENT ON GOOD NATUREDLY THERE OUGHT TO BE ONE FAIRY FOR EVERY BOY AND GIRL OUGHT TO BE ISN'T THERE NO
MICHAEL CRIED NAUGHTILY MISSUS DARLING LEFT THE ROOM TO GET A CHOCOLATE FOR HIM AND MISTER DARLING THOUGHT THIS SHOWED WANT OF FIRMNESS MOTHER DON'T PAMPER HIM HE CALLED AFTER HER MICHAEL WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE I TOOK MEDICINE WITHOUT A MURMUR I SAID
THE STRONG BENT OF NATURE IS SEEN IN THE PROPORTION WHICH THIS TOPIC OF PERSONAL RELATIONS USURPS IN THE CONVERSATION OF SOCIETY WHAT DO WE WISH TO KNOW OF ANY WORTHY PERSON SO MUCH AS HOW HE HAS SPED IN THE HISTORY OF THIS SENTIMENT
AND A PAIR OF PEARL STUDS THE NEWCOMER GLARED ROUND AT THE VALET TAKE THESE HE ORDERED PEREMPTORILY POINTING TO THE BOOKS UNDER HIS ARM FISHER HASTENED TO OBEY AND NOTED WITH SOME WONDER THAT THE VISITOR DID NOT ATTEMPT TO ASSIST HIM
YET THE REMEMBRANCE OF THESE VISIONS OUTLASTS ALL OTHER REMEMBRANCES AND IS A WREATH OF FLOWERS ON THE OLDEST BROWS BUT HERE IS A STRANGE FACT IT MAY SEEM TO MANY MEN IN REVISING THEIR EXPERIENCE
AN EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST DRAWER DID NOT PRODUCE ALL THAT SHE HAD EXPECTED SHE RETURNED THE PAPERS TO THE DRAWER PUSHED IT TO AND LOCKED IT SHE GAVE HER ATTENTION TO THE SECOND DRAWER HER HAND SHOOK A LITTLE AS SHE PULLED IT OPEN
IN THAT CASE WAS A NEW STEEL KEY
ESTABLISHES MARRIAGE AND GIVES PERMANENCE TO HUMAN SOCIETY THE NATURAL ASSOCIATION OF THE SENTIMENT OF LOVE WITH THE HEYDAY OF THE BLOOD SEEMS TO REQUIRE THAT IN ORDER TO PORTRAY IT IN VIVID TINTS WHICH EVERY YOUTH AND MAID SHOULD CONFESS TO BE TRUE TO THEIR THROBBING EXPERIENCE
THE CLOUDS HAVE FACES AS HE LOOKS ON THEM THE TREES OF THE FOREST THE WAVING GRASS AND THE PEEPING FLOWERS HAVE GROWN INTELLIGENT AND HE ALMOST FEARS TO TRUST THEM WITH THE SECRET WHICH THEY SEEM TO INVITE YET NATURE SOOTHES AND SYMPATHIZES
YES SIR SAID THE SERVANT SUCH AN INSTRUCTION WAS REMARKABLY PLEASING TO HIM THERE WAS MUCH THAT HE HAD TO DO AND THAT NIGHT'S FREEDOM WOULD ASSIST HIM MATERIALLY PERHAPS KARA HESITATED PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER WAIT UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK
EVERY PROMISE OF THE SOUL HAS INNUMERABLE FULFILMENTS EACH OF ITS JOYS RIPENS INTO A NEW WANT NATURE UNCONTAINABLE FLOWING FORELOOKING
GLOWS AND ENLARGES UNTIL IT WARMS AND BEAMS UPON MULTITUDES OF MEN AND WOMEN UPON THE UNIVERSAL HEART OF ALL AND SO LIGHTS UP THE WHOLE WORLD AND ALL NATURE WITH ITS GENEROUS FLAMES
SPECIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT SCOTLAND YARD WHITEHALL HE PUT IT CAREFULLY IN HIS POCKET AND WENT FROM THE ROOM TO CHANGE LARGE AS THE HOUSE WAS KARA DID NOT EMPLOY A REGULAR STAFF OF SERVANTS A MAID AND A VALET COMPRISED THE WHOLE OF THE INDOOR STAFF
THE APOLOGIES WHICH ARE DUE TO YOU I FEEL THAT ANYTHING LESS WILL NEITHER REHABILITATE ME IN YOUR ESTEEM NOR SECURE FOR ME THE REMNANTS OF MY SHATTERED SELF RESPECT I AM HOPING YOU WILL DINE WITH ME NEXT WEEK AND MEET A MOST INTERESTING MAN GEORGE GATHERCOLE
THE GIRL ASCENDED TO THE UPPER FLOOR AGAIN SHE WATCHED FROM THE WINDOW THE DISAPPEARING FIGURE ONCE OUT OF SIGHT MISS HOLLAND WENT TO WORK WITH A REMARKABLE DELIBERATION AND THOROUGHNESS FROM HER BAG SHE PRODUCED A SMALL PURSE AND OPENED IT
AT SIX O'CLOCK MISS THE MAN REPLIED THERE IS RATHER AN IMPORTANT LETTER HERE WHICH HAS TO BE DELIVERED SHALL I RING UP FOR A MESSENGER NO I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE ADVISABLE YOU HAD BETTER TAKE IT YOURSELF
WHAT WOULD JUSTIFY THE USE OF SUCH AN AWFUL WEAPON SHE ASKED IT IS AMPLY JUSTIFIED TO SECURE AN END HE SAID BLANDLY FOR EXAMPLE I WANT SOMETHING I CANNOT OBTAIN THAT SOMETHING THROUGH THE ORDINARY CHANNEL OR BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF ORDINARY MEANS
TO DISTURB A RELATIONSHIP WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS HOPED WOULD BE MUTUALLY PLEASANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW GATHERCOLE WHO WILL BE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE PART HE IS PLAYING TO ACT AS PEACEMAKER BETWEEN YOURSELF AND MYSELF
A MAN AGAINST WHOM MY FAVOURITE WEAPON WOULD FAIL SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH INTEREST IN HER EYES WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE WEAPON MISTER KARA SHE ASKED FEAR HE SAID
IF HE EXPECTED HER TO GIVE HIM ANY ENCOURAGEMENT TO PROCEED HE WAS DISAPPOINTED PROBABLY HE REQUIRED NO SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT FOR IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS SOCIAL INFERIORS HE WAS SOMEWHAT MONOPOLIZING CUT A MAN'S FLESH AND IT HEALS HE SAID
THY LOVING HEART IN THE NOON AND THE AFTERNOON OF LIFE WE STILL THROB AT THE RECOLLECTION OF DAYS WHEN HAPPINESS WAS NOT HAPPY ENOUGH BUT MUST BE DRUGGED WITH THE RELISH OF PAIN AND FEAR FOR HE TOUCHED THE SECRET OF THE MATTER WHO SAID OF LOVE
FISHER TOOK THE CARD FROM THE SALVER AND READ MISTER GEORGE GATHERCOLE JUNIOR TRAVELLERS CLUB I'LL SEE THIS GENTLEMAN HE SAID WITH A SUDDEN BRISK INTEREST HE FOUND THE VISITOR STANDING IN THE HALL
UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT ANY RATE HE'S A FUNK SNAPPED THE OTHER A BEASTLY FUNK HE STAMPED DOWN THE STAIRS AS THOUGH TESTING THE WEIGHT OF EVERY TREAD OPENED THE FRONT DOOR WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SLAMMED IT BEHIND HIM AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT
I FAIRLY GET THE CREEPS SITTING HERE HOUR AFTER HOUR IT'S THAT DOOR THAT GIVES ME THE HUMP SHE POINTED TO THE FAR END OF THE KITCHEN TO A SOILED LOOKING DOOR OF UNPAINTED WOOD THAT'S MISTER KARA'S WINE CELLAR NOBODY'S BEEN IN IT BUT HIM
AND ACCORDING TO YOUR ARGUMENT THEY ARE ALSO JUSTIFIED IT IS A MATTER OF PLANE HE SAID AIRILY VIEWED FROM MY STANDPOINT THEY ARE SORDID CRIMINALS THE SORT OF PERSON THAT T X MEETS I PRESUME IN THE COURSE OF HIS DAILY WORK
FOR PERSONS ARE LOVE'S WORLD AND THE COLDEST PHILOSOPHER CANNOT RECOUNT THE DEBT OF THE YOUNG SOUL WANDERING HERE IN NATURE TO THE POWER OF LOVE WITHOUT BEING TEMPTED TO UNSAY AS TREASONABLE TO NATURE AUGHT DEROGATORY TO THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
AND FISHER STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WONDERED WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE THE VISITOR SO GENIAL I SUPPOSE YOUR CHEQUE WILL BE HONOURED ALL RIGHT ASKED THE VISITOR SARDONICALLY AND THEN BURST INTO A LITTLE CHUCKLE OF LAUGHTER AS HE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR
IT WAS A SQUARE CASE COVERED IN RED MOROCCO LEATHER SHE INSERTED HER SHAKING HAND AND TOOK IT OUT WITH A TRIUMPHANT LITTLE CRY AT LAST SHE SAID ALOUD AND THEN A HAND GRASPED HER WRIST AND IN A PANIC SHE TURNED TO MEET THE SMILING FACE
HE WALKS WITH ARMS AKIMBO HE SOLILOQUIZES HE ACCOSTS THE GRASS AND THE TREES HE FEELS THE BLOOD OF THE VIOLET THE CLOVER AND THE LILY IN HIS VEINS AND HE TALKS WITH THE BROOK THAT WETS HIS FOOT
HE HOLDS HER BOOKS TO HELP HER AND INSTANTLY IT SEEMS TO HIM AS IF SHE REMOVED HERSELF FROM HIM INFINITELY AND WAS A SACRED PRECINCT AMONG THE THRONG OF GIRLS HE RUNS RUDELY ENOUGH BUT ONE ALONE DISTANCES HIM
PROVIDING ALWAYS THAT I CAN SECURE MY OBJECT IN THE TIME OTHERWISE HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I SEE SHE SAID NODDING HER HEAD QUICKLY I SUPPOSE THAT IS HOW BLACKMAILERS FEEL HE FROWNED
THAT THEY HAVE NO FAIRER PAGE IN THEIR LIFE'S BOOK THAN THE DELICIOUS MEMORY OF SOME PASSAGES WHEREIN AFFECTION CONTRIVED TO GIVE A WITCHCRAFT SURPASSING THE DEEP ATTRACTION OF ITS OWN TRUTH TO A PARCEL OF ACCIDENTAL AND TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
I KNOW HE GOES IN SOMETIMES BECAUSE I TRIED A DODGE THAT MY BROTHER WHO'S A POLICEMAN TAUGHT ME I STRETCHED A BIT OF WHITE COTTON ACROSS IT AN IT WAS BROKE THE NEXT MORNING MISTER KARA KEEPS SOME OF HIS PRIVATE PAPERS IN THERE SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY HE HAS TOLD ME SO HIMSELF
INTO THE MOST PITIFUL AND ABJECT IT WILL INFUSE A HEART AND COURAGE TO DEFY THE WORLD SO ONLY IT HAVE THE COUNTENANCE OF THE BELOVED OBJECT IN GIVING HIM TO ANOTHER IT STILL MORE GIVES HIM TO HIMSELF
THE MORNING AND THE NIGHT VARIED ENCHANTMENTS WHEN A SINGLE TONE OF ONE VOICE COULD MAKE THE HEART BOUND AND THE MOST TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCE ASSOCIATED WITH ONE FORM IS PUT IN THE AMBER OF MEMORY
HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER GATHERCOLE AND KARA CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE TO MEET HIS AGENT WHO WITH TOP HAT STILL ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND HIS OVERCOAT DANGLING ABOUT HIS HEELS MUST HAVE MADE A REMARKABLE PICTURE
AND WHAT FASTENS ATTENTION IN THE INTERCOURSE OF LIFE LIKE ANY PASSAGE BETRAYING AFFECTION BETWEEN TWO PARTIES PERHAPS WE NEVER SAW THEM BEFORE AND NEVER SHALL MEET THEM AGAIN BUT WE SEE THEM EXCHANGE A GLANCE OR BETRAY A DEEP EMOTION AND WE ARE NO LONGER STRANGERS
WHICH HAVE GIVEN HIM SINCEREST INSTRUCTION AND NOURISHMENT HE WILL SHRINK AND MOAN ALAS I KNOW NOT WHY BUT INFINITE COMPUNCTIONS EMBITTER IN MATURE LIFE THE REMEMBRANCES OF BUDDING JOY AND COVER EVERY BELOVED NAME
DETAIN HIM ON SOME PRETEXT OR OTHER BECAUSE HE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF AND I WANT TO SEE HIM
AND THEREFORE I KNOW I INCUR THE IMPUTATION OF UNNECESSARY HARDNESS AND STOICISM FROM THOSE WHO COMPOSE THE COURT AND PARLIAMENT OF LOVE BUT FROM THESE FORMIDABLE CENSORS I SHALL APPEAL TO MY SENIORS
TO REFUSE THE FAVOURS OF REMINGTON KARA WAS BY HIM REGARDED AS SOMETHING OF AN AFFRONT
EITHER BY LOOSENING HIS HOLD OF THE VOLUMES OR RAISING HIS HAND ACCIDENTALLY THE VALET'S HAND PRESSED AGAINST THE OTHER'S SLEEVE AND HE RECEIVED A SHOCK FOR THE FOREARM WAS CLEARLY AN ARTIFICIAL ONE IT WAS AGAINST A WOODEN SURFACE BENEATH THE SLEEVE THAT HIS KNUCKLES STRUCK
THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO KARA'S STUDY AND SET THE PAPERS IN ORDER WAS NATURAL AND PROPER THAT HE SHOULD CONDUCT A RAPID EXAMINATION OF ALL THE DRAWERS IN KARA'S DESK MIGHT BE EXCUSED ON THE SCORE OF DILIGENCE SINCE HE WAS TO SOME EXTENT IN THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS EMPLOYER
AND THIS VIEW OF THE STRANGER'S INFIRMITY WAS CONFIRMED WHEN THE OTHER REACHED ROUND WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TOOK HOLD OF THE GLOVED LEFT HAND AND THRUST IT INTO THE POCKET OF HIS OVERCOAT WHERE IS KARA GROWLED THE STRANGER
THE ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE HOUSE BESIDE THE GIRL WAS THE MIDDLE AGED DOMESTIC WHO WAS PARLOUR MAID SERVING MAID AND HOUSEKEEPER IN ONE MISS HOLLAND SAT AT HER DESK TO ALL APPEARANCE READING OVER THE LETTERS SHE HAD TYPED THAT AFTERNOON
IT CARRIED HIM BACK A DOZEN YEARS TO A DIRTY LITTLE PEASANT'S CABIN ON THE HILLSIDE OUTSIDE DURAZZO TO THE LIVID FACE OF A YOUNG ALBANIAN CHIEF WHO HAD LOST AT KARA'S WHIM ALL THAT LIFE HELD FOR A MAN
TO THAT TERRIBLE HOUR OF WAITING WHEN HE SAT BOUND TO A POST WITH A CANDLE FLICKERING AND SPLUTTERING LOWER AND LOWER TO THE LITTLE HEAP OF GUNPOWDER THAT WOULD START THE TRAIL TOWARD THE CLUMSY INFERNAL MACHINE UNDER HIS CHAIR
HE SHIVERED AS HE GLANCED INTO THE BLEAK STREET KEEP MY FIRE GOING PUT ALL MY PRIVATE LETTERS IN MY BEDROOM AND SEE THAT MISS HOLLAND HAS HER LUNCH FISHER FOLLOWED HIM TO HIS CAR WRAPPED THE FUR RUG ABOUT HIS LEGS
SIX O'CLOCK EH YOU WILL TELL MISTER KARA THAT I CALLED GIVE ME THOSE BOOKS BUT I ASSURE YOU SIR STAMMERED FISHER GIVE ME THOSE BOOKS ROARED THE OTHER
GOOD MORNING TO YOU IF YOU WOULD ONLY WAIT SIR PLEADED THE AGONIZED FISHER WAIT BE HANGED SNARLED THE OTHER I'VE WAITED THREE YEARS I TELL YOU TELL MISTER KARA TO EXPECT ME WHEN HE SEES ME HE WENT OUT AND MOST UNNECESSARILY BANGED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME FROM KARA'S ROOM A FAINT CLANG WHAT'S THAT ASKED THE VISITOR A LITTLE STARTLED MISTER KARA'S PUT DOWN HIS STEEL LATCH SAID FISHER WITH A SMILE WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS NOT TO BE DISTURBED UNTIL HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
THE LIKE FORCE HAS THE PASSION OVER ALL HIS NATURE IT EXPANDS THE SENTIMENT IT MAKES THE CLOWN GENTLE AND GIVES THE COWARD HEART
HE REMEMBERED THE DAY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS CANDLEMAS DAY AND THIS WAS THE ANNIVERSARY HE REMEMBERED OTHER THINGS MORE PLEASANT
AND THE FIRST CONDITION IS THAT WE MUST LEAVE A TOO CLOSE AND LINGERING ADHERENCE TO FACTS AND STUDY THE SENTIMENT AS IT APPEARED IN HOPE AND NOT IN HISTORY FOR EACH MAN SEES HIS OWN LIFE DEFACED AND DISFIGURED
TO THE HATEFUL EYES OF THE GIRL'S FATHER WHO STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS GLARING DOWN AT THE BOUND AND MANACLED FIGURE ON THE FLOOR TO THE SMOKE STAINED RAFTERS OF THIS PEASANT COTTAGE AND THE DANCING SHADOWS ON THE ROOF
CLOSED THE DOOR CAREFULLY AND RETURNED TO THE HOUSE
YES SIR SAID THE VALET HASTILY IS IT REAL GREY INSISTED THE VISITOR PULL ONE OUT AND SEE THE STARTLED FISHER DREW BACK WITH AN APOLOGETIC SMILE I COULDN'T THINK OF DOING A THING LIKE THAT SIR OH YOU COULDN'T SNEERED THE VISITOR
BUT HER MIND WAS VERY FAR FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE BEFORE HER SHE HEARD THE SOFT THUD OF THE FRONT DOOR CLOSING AND RISING SHE CROSSED THE ROOM RAPIDLY AND LOOKED DOWN THROUGH THE WINDOW TO THE STREET SHE WATCHED FISHER UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT
THAN THERE IS IN THAT SUCCESSION OF CAUSES WHICH CONSTITUTES THE UNIVERSE WHAT WAS IT THEN WHICH DETERMINED SOMETHING TO EXIST RATHER THAN NOTHING AND BESTOWED BEING ON A PARTICULAR POSSIBILITY EXCLUSIVE OF THE REST
THE ANGLICAN FAITH AND WORSHIP WERE PRESCRIBED BY LAW SUSTAINED BY TAXES IMPOSED ON ALL AND FAVORED BY THE GOVERNOR THE PROVINCIAL COUNCILORS AND THE RICHEST PLANTERS THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH SAYS LODGE WAS ONE OF THE APPENDAGES OF THE VIRGINIA ARISTOCRACY
WHICH I AM AFRAID CAN NEVER BE ASCERTAINED WITH CERTAINTY FROM ANY OTHER TOPIC FOR HOW CAN AN EFFECT WHICH EITHER IS FINITE OR FOR AUGHT WE KNOW MAY BE SO HOW CAN SUCH AN EFFECT I SAY PROVE AN INFINITE CAUSE
OF AN EXTRAORDINARY GROUP OF LEADERS FAMILIAR WITH HISTORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND THE ARTS OF WAR GOVERNMENT AND DIPLOMACY ITSELF BORE ELOQUENT TESTIMONY TO THE HIGH QUALITY OF THE AMERICAN INTELLECT NO ONE NOT EVEN THE MOST CRITICAL
AND FEWER STILL WHO COULD DEVOTE THEIR LIVES TO THINGS THAT DELIGHT THE EYE AND THE MIND AND YET POOR AND MEAGER AS THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THE COLONISTS MAY SEEM BY WAY OF COMPARISON HEROIC EFFORTS WERE MADE IN EVERY COMMUNITY TO LIFT THE PEOPLE ABOVE THE PLANE
AND THE PATRIOT NEWSPAPERS FOUNDED AND MANAGED BY WOMEN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES IN THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF AMERICA THE CHURCHES ASSUMED A ROLE OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
AND THEIR KEEN INTEREST IN PUBLIC ISSUES IS EVIDENT IN MANY A RECORD LIKE THE LETTERS OF MISSUS JOHN ADAMS TO HER HUSBAND DURING THE REVOLUTION THE WRITINGS OF MISSUS MERCY OTIS WARREN THE SISTER OF JAMES OTIS WHO MEASURED HER PEN WITH THE BRITISH PROPAGANDISTS
WE DARE NOT AFFIRM THAT WE KNOW ALL THE QUALITIES OF MATTER AND FOR AUGHT WE CAN DETERMINE IT MAY CONTAIN SOME QUALITIES WHICH WERE THEY KNOWN WOULD MAKE ITS NON EXISTENCE APPEAR AS GREAT A CONTRADICTION AS THAT TWICE TWO IS FIVE
TO BE THE CREATOR UPHOLDER AND RULER OF THE WORLD
SOMETIMES BEATEN SOMETIMES DUCKED HIS FURNITURE WAS THROWN OUT OF THE WINDOWS HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN TURNED OUT OF DOORS IN THE SNOW HE WAS THEN CARRIED TO THE MARKET PLACE AND EXPOSED DURING SOME TIME AS A MALEFACTOR
WHEN AT LENGTH THE ESTATES MET THEIR DELIBERATIONS WERE CARRIED ON WITH PERFECT FREEDOM AND IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH ANCIENT FORMS THERE WAS INDEED AFTER THE FIRST FLIGHT OF JAMES
BUT A SKILFUL ALGEBRAIST IMMEDIATELY CONCLUDES IT TO BE THE WORK OF NECESSITY AND DEMONSTRATES THAT IT MUST FOR EVER RESULT FROM THE NATURE OF THESE NUMBERS
IT SEEMS TO ME SO OBVIOUSLY ILL GROUNDED AND AT THE SAME TIME OF SO LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO THE CAUSE OF TRUE PIETY AND RELIGION THAT I SHALL MYSELF VENTURE TO SHOW THE FALLACY OF IT
MAY IT NOT HAPPEN THAT COULD WE PENETRATE INTO THE INTIMATE NATURE OF BODIES WE SHOULD CLEARLY SEE WHY IT WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE THEY COULD EVER ADMIT OF ANY OTHER DISPOSITION
PRESBYTERIANS QUAKERS BAPTISTS AND PURITANS HAD NO HIERARCHY OF BISHOPS AND ARCHBISHOPS TO BIND THEM TO THE SEAT OF POWER IN LONDON NEITHER DID THEY LOOK TO THAT METROPOLIS FOR GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING ARTICLES OF FAITH
AND SACKED THE CELLAR AND LARDER OF THE MINISTER WHICH AT THAT SEASON WERE PROBABLY BETTER STOCKED THAN USUAL
WHO CARRIES THE REASON OF HIS EXISTENCE IN HIMSELF AND WHO CANNOT BE SUPPOSED NOT TO EXIST WITHOUT AN EXPRESS CONTRADICTION THERE IS CONSEQUENTLY SUCH A BEING THAT IS THERE IS A DEITY
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING TOGETHER A CONVENTION COMMANDING THE PUBLIC RESPECT AND EXPRESSING THE PUBLIC OPINION IT WAS HARDLY TO BE EXPECTED FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE WHIGS IN THIS DAY OF THEIR POWER WOULD ENDURE TO SEE THEIR HEREDITARY LEADER
BUT THIS PROCLAMATION NOT BEING SUPPORTED BY TROOPS WAS VERY LITTLE REGARDED ON THE VERY DAY AFTER IT WAS PUBLISHED AT GLASGOW THE VENERABLE CATHEDRAL OF THAT CITY ALMOST THE ONLY FINE CHURCH OF THE MIDDLE AGES WHICH STANDS UNINJURED IN SCOTLAND
HAVE NO MEANING OR WHICH IS THE SAME THING NONE THAT IS CONSISTENT BUT FURTHER WHY MAY NOT THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE BE THE NECESSARILY EXISTENT BEING ACCORDING TO THIS PRETENDED EXPLICATION OF NECESSITY
SEVERAL LORDS WHO HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR HONOURS BY SENTENCES WHICH THE GENERAL VOICE LOUDLY CONDEMNED AS UNJUST AND HE TOOK ON HIMSELF TO DISPENSE WITH THE ACT WHICH DEPRIVED PRESBYTERIANS OF THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE
LOCAL SELF GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS ECCLESIASTICAL HELPED TO TRAIN THEM FOR LOCAL SELF GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS POLITICAL THE SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE WHICH LED DISSENTERS TO REVOLT IN THE OLD WORLD
AND ANY FORM MAY BE CONCEIVED TO BE ALTERED SUCH AN ANNIHILATION OR ALTERATION THEREFORE IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE
I FIND ONLY ONE ARGUMENT EMPLOYED TO PROVE THAT THE MATERIAL WORLD IS NOT THE NECESSARILY EXISTENT BEING AND THIS ARGUMENT IS DERIVED FROM THE CONTINGENCY BOTH OF THE MATTER AND THE FORM OF THE WORLD
SUBSTITUTING FOR IT A SIMPLE PROPERTY QUALIFICATION THUS A ROYAL GOVERNOR AND AN OFFICIAL FAMILY CERTAIN TO BE EPISCOPALIAN IN FAITH AND MONARCHIST IN SYMPATHIES WERE FORCED UPON MASSACHUSETTS
AND MEMBERS OF ALL RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS IF THEY HAD THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF PROPERTY WERE PERMITTED TO TAKE PART IN ELECTIONS BY THIS ACT IN THE NAME OF THE CROWN THE PURITAN MONOPOLY WAS BROKEN DOWN IN MASSACHUSETTS
IN SUCH A CHAIN TOO OR SUCCESSION OF OBJECTS EACH PART IS CAUSED BY THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT AND CAUSES THAT WHICH SUCCEEDS IT WHERE THEN IS THE DIFFICULTY BUT THE WHOLE YOU SAY WANTS A CAUSE
OTHER PEOPLE EVEN OF GOOD SENSE AND THE BEST INCLINED TO RELIGION FEEL ALWAYS SOME DEFICIENCY IN SUCH ARGUMENTS THOUGH THEY ARE NOT PERHAPS ABLE TO EXPLAIN DISTINCTLY WHERE IT LIES
IT WAS VAIN TO HOPE THAT MERE WORDS WOULD QUIET A NATION WHICH HAD NOT IN ANY AGE BEEN VERY AMENABLE TO CONTROL AND WHICH WAS NOW AGITATED BY HOPES AND RESENTMENTS SUCH AS GREAT REVOLUTIONS FOLLOWING GREAT OPPRESSIONS NATURALLY ENGENDER
IN THE SAME MANNER AS WE LIE UNDER A NECESSITY OF ALWAYS CONCEIVING TWICE TWO TO BE FOUR
IN THIS MEETING IT WAS DETERMINED THAT FOR THE FUTURE THE EJECTION OF THE ESTABLISHED CLERGY
SCATTERED FROM MASSACHUSETTS TO GEORGIA THE ADAMSES ELLSWORTH THE MORRISES THE LIVINGSTONS HAMILTON FRANKLIN WASHINGTON MADISON MARSHALL HENRY THE RANDOLPHS AND THE PINCKNEYS
IN MOUNTING UP THEREFORE FROM EFFECTS TO CAUSES WE MUST EITHER GO ON IN TRACING AN INFINITE SUCCESSION WITHOUT ANY ULTIMATE CAUSE AT ALL OR MUST AT LAST HAVE RECOURSE TO SOME ULTIMATE CAUSE THAT IS NECESSARILY EXISTENT
TAKEN ON HIMSELF PROVISIONALLY THE EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF THAT KINGDOM THE MEANS OF MAINTAINING ORDER THERE WERE NOT AT HIS COMMAND HE HAD NOT A SINGLE REGIMENT NORTH OF THE TWEED OR INDEED WITHIN MANY MILES OF THAT RIVER
MORE THAN THE REVERENCE PAID BY THE PRELATIST TO THE ANCIENT HOLIDAYS OF THE CHURCH THAT SUCH REVERENCE MAY BE CARRIED TO AN ABSURD EXTREME IS TRUE BUT A PHILOSOPHER MAY PERHAPS BE INCLINED TO THINK THE OPPOSITE EXTREME NOT LESS ABSURD
WHICH I WOULD INSIST ON IS THE COMMON ONE WHATEVER EXISTS MUST HAVE A CAUSE OR REASON OF ITS EXISTENCE IT BEING ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY THING TO PRODUCE ITSELF OR BE THE CAUSE OF ITS OWN EXISTENCE
THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF SCOTLAND HAVING BEEN DURING MANY YEARS FAR MORE OPPRESSIVE AND CORRUPT THAN THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND SHOULD HAVE FALLEN WITH A FAR HEAVIER RUIN THE MOVEMENT AGAINST THE LAST KING OF THE HOUSE OF STUART WAS IN ENGLAND CONSERVATIVE
LIBERTY IN MATTERS OF CONSCIENCE WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE BEGINNING MARYLAND BY GRANTING IN SIXTEEN FORTY NINE FREEDOM TO THOSE WHO PROFESSED TO BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST OPENED ITS GATES TO ALL CHRISTIANS AND PENNSYLVANIA TRUE TO THE TENETS OF THE FRIENDS
DID I SHOW YOU THE PARTICULAR CAUSES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL IN A COLLECTION OF TWENTY PARTICLES OF MATTER I SHOULD THINK IT VERY UNREASONABLE SHOULD YOU AFTERWARDS ASK ME WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE WHOLE TWENTY
FROM STARTING ANY FURTHER DIFFICULTIES YET I CANNOT FORBEAR INSISTING STILL UPON ANOTHER TOPIC IT IS OBSERVED BY ARITHMETICIANS THAT THE PRODUCTS OF NINE COMPOSE ALWAYS EITHER NINE OR SOME LESSER PRODUCT OF NINE
CATHOLICS AND OTHER DENOMINATIONS BECAME TOO STRONGLY INTRENCHED AND TOO WIDELY SCATTERED TO PERMIT ANY ONE OF THEM TO RULE IF IT HAD DESIRED TO DO SO THERE WERE COMMUNITIES AND INDEED WHOLE SECTIONS WHERE ONE OR ANOTHER CHURCH PREVAILED
WHO STILL CHERISHED MEMORIES OF BITTER RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS IN THE MOTHER COUNTRY PURITANISM IN NEW ENGLAND IF THE ESTABLISHED FAITH MADE FOR IMPERIAL UNITY THE SAME COULD NOT BE SAID OF PURITANISM
THE CLERGY AT LEAST IN THE BEGINNING FORMED THE ONLY CLASS WITH ANY LEISURE TO DEVOTE TO MATTERS OF THE SPIRIT THEY PREACHED ON SUNDAYS AND TAUGHT SCHOOL ON WEEK DAYS THEY LED IN THE DISCUSSION OF LOCAL PROBLEMS AND IN THE FORMATION OF POLITICAL OPINION
SO THE EPISCOPAL PARISH PRIESTS WERE CALLED WERE EXPELLED THE GRAVER COVENANTERS WHILE THEY APPLAUDED THE FERVOUR OF THEIR RIOTOUS BRETHREN WERE APPREHENSIVE THAT PROCEEDINGS SO IRREGULAR MIGHT GIVE SCANDAL AND LEARNED WITH ESPECIAL CONCERN
WHICH PROMISED IN TIME A SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE AND FREEDOM OF OPINION THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND VIRGINIA WAS THE STRONGHOLD OF THE ENGLISH SYSTEM OF CHURCH AND STATE
THAT THEY WOULD SUFFER THE ELECTION OF MEMBERS FOR COUNTIES AND TOWNS TO BE CONDUCTED ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE EXISTING LAW FOR UNDER THE EXISTING LAW
WITHIN THE CHURCH SOON AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL IN MASSACHUSETTS LIKEWISE FLUNG OFF THEIR YOKE OF UNION WITH THE ANGLICANS IN EACH TOWN A SEPARATE CONGREGATION WAS ORGANIZED THE MALE MEMBERS CHOOSING THE PASTOR THE TEACHERS AND THE OTHER OFFICERS
THOUGH I KNOW THAT THE STARTING OBJECTIONS IS HIS CHIEF DELIGHT
THERE WERE ABUNDANT REASONS FOR THIS IN MANY OF THE COLONIES MARYLAND PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW ENGLAND THE RELIGIOUS IMPULSE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE IMPELLING MOTIVES IN STIMULATING IMMIGRATION IN ALL THE COLONIES
OF MERE EXISTENCE AFTER THE FIRST CLEARINGS WERE OPENED IN THE FORESTS THOSE EFFORTS WERE REDOUBLED AND WITH LENGTHENING YEARS TOLD UPON THE THOUGHT AND SPIRIT OF THE LAND THE APPEARANCE DURING THE STRUGGLE WITH ENGLAND
IT MUST BE SOME UNKNOWN INCONCEIVABLE QUALITIES WHICH CAN MAKE HIS NON EXISTENCE APPEAR IMPOSSIBLE OR HIS ATTRIBUTES UNALTERABLE AND NO REASON CAN BE ASSIGNED WHY THESE QUALITIES MAY NOT BELONG TO MATTER
AND WE SHALL AFTERWARDS FROM ITSELF BETTER THAN FROM ITS USEFUL CONSEQUENCES ENDEAVOUR TO DETERMINE WHAT VALUE WE OUGHT TO PUT UPON IT
A THOUGHTLESS MAID SERVANT WHO FOR SOME EARTHLY REASON SMILED IN CHURCH WAS IN DANGER OF BEING BANISHED AS A VAGABOND ROBERT PIKE A DEVOUT PURITAN THINKING THE SUN HAD GONE TO REST VENTURED FORTH ON HORSEBACK ONE SUNDAY EVENING
IS IT NOT PROBABLE I ASK THAT THE WHOLE ECONOMY OF THE UNIVERSE IS CONDUCTED BY A LIKE NECESSITY THOUGH NO HUMAN ALGEBRA CAN FURNISH A KEY WHICH SOLVES THE DIFFICULTY AND INSTEAD OF ADMIRING THE ORDER OF NATURAL BEINGS
WAS ATTACKED BY A CROWD OF PRESBYTERIANS FROM THE MEETING HOUSES WITH WHOM WERE MINGLED MANY OF THEIR FIERCER BRETHREN FROM THE HILLS IT WAS A SUNDAY BUT TO RABBLE A CONGREGATION OF PRELATISTS WAS HELD TO BE A WORK OF NECESSITY AND MERCY
BUT THAT ANARCHY NOWHERE LASTED LONGER THAN FORTY EIGHT HOURS FROM THE DAY ON WHICH WILLIAM REACHED SAINT JAMES'S NOT EVEN THE MOST UNPOPULAR AGENTS OF THE FALLEN GOVERNMENT NOT EVEN THE MINISTERS OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
IF YOU ADD TOGETHER ALL THE CHARACTERS OF WHICH ANY OF THE FORMER PRODUCTS IS COMPOSED THUS OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY SIX WHICH ARE PRODUCTS OF NINE YOU MAKE NINE BY ADDING ONE TO EIGHT TWO TO SEVEN THREE TO SIX
HIS GOWN WAS TORN TO SHREDS OVER HIS HEAD IF HE HAD A PRAYER BOOK IN HIS POCKET IT WAS BURNED AND HE WAS DISMISSED WITH A CHARGE NEVER AS HE VALUED HIS LIFE
INDEED THOSE WHO LAID OUT THE CITY HAD NEVER MEANT THAT IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAND A REGULAR SIEGE
THE FIRST QUESTION TO BE DECIDED WAS WHETHER JAMES SHOULD REMAIN AT DUBLIN OR SHOULD PUT HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF HIS ARMY IN ULSTER ON THIS QUESTION THE IRISH AND BRITISH FACTIONS JOINED BATTLE REASONS OF NO GREAT WEIGHT WERE ADDUCED ON BOTH SIDES FOR NEITHER PARTY VENTURED TO SPEAK OUT
UNTO THE TIME THAT I KNOW WHAT IS HIS RIGHT NAME AND OF WHAT KINDRED HE IS COME SHALL I NEVER BE MERRY AT MY HEART SISTER SAID SIR GRINGAMORE ALL THIS SHALL BE DONE AFTER YOUR INTENT AND SO HE RODE ALL THE OTHER DAY AND THE NIGHT TILL THAT HE FOUND SIR BEAUMAINS LYING BY A WATER
FAINT INDEED AND TRANSIENT OF THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PRECEDING DECEMBER THE DAY WAS IN LONDON AND IN MANY OTHER PLACES A DAY OF GENERAL REJOICING THE CHURCHES WERE FILLED IN THE MORNING THE AFTERNOON WAS SPENT IN SPORT AND CAROUSING
WITH LONG LIFE AND MUTUAL LOVE WITH OBEDIENT SUBJECTS WISE COUNSELLORS AND FAITHFUL ALLIES WITH GALLANT FLEETS AND ARMIES WITH VICTORY WITH PEACE AND FINALLY WITH CROWNS MORE GLORIOUS AND MORE DURABLE THAN THOSE WHICH THEN GLITTERED ON THE ALTAR OF THE ABBEY
IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT HE DESIRED HONORARY DISTINCTIONS WITH A GREEDINESS OF WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF ASHAMED AND WHICH WAS UNWORTHY OF HIS FINE UNDERSTANDING THE TRUTH IS THAT HIS AMBITION WAS AT THIS TIME CHILLED BY HIS FEARS
WAS NEVER INTENDED TO TRAMMEL HIM IN HIS LEGISLATIVE CAPACITY LEAVE THAT OATH AS IT IS NOW DRAWN AND NO PRINCE CAN MISUNDERSTAND IT NO PRINCE CAN SERIOUSLY IMAGINE THAT THE TWO HOUSES MEAN TO EXACT FROM HIM A PROMISE THAT HE WILL PUT A VETO ON LAWS
HUNGER MUST SOON BRING THE CONTEST TO AN END THE STOCK OF PROVISIONS WAS SMALL
WHICH REQUIRED EVERY PERSON WHO HELD ANY ECCLESIASTICAL OR ACADEMICAL PREFERMENT TO TAKE THE OATHS BY THE FIRST OF AUGUST SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE ON PAIN OF SUSPENSION SIX MONTHS TO BE RECKONED FROM THAT DAY WERE ALLOWED TO THE NONJUROR FOR RECONSIDERATION
EARL OF PORTLAND MORDAUNT WAS MADE EARL OF MONMOUTH NOT WITHOUT SOME MURMURING ON THE PART OF OLD EXCLUSIONISTS WHO STILL REMEMBERED WITH FONDNESS THEIR PROTESTANT DUKE AND WHO HAD HOPED THAT HIS ATTAINDER WOULD BE REVERSED AND THAT HIS TITLE WOULD BE BORNE BY HIS DESCENDANTS
AND THEREFORE BROTHER I OWE HIM MY SERVICE AFORE ALL KNIGHTS LIVING AND WIT YE WELL THAT I LOVE HIM BEFORE ALL OTHER AND FULL FAIN I WOULD SPEAK WITH HIM
IT WAS NEVER DOUBTED BY THE MOST RIGID CASUIST
THE KING'S CROWN WAS CARRIED BY GRAFTON THE QUEEN'S BY SOMERSET THE POINTED SWORD EMBLEMATICAL OF TEMPORAL JUSTICE WAS BORNE BY PEMBROKE ORMOND WAS LORD HIGH CONSTABLE FOR THE DAY AND RODE UP THE HALL ON THE RIGHT HAND OF THE HEREDITARY CHAMPION
AND THEREFORE I REDE YOU NOT FOLLOW HIM FOR HE IS ONE OF THE PERILOUST KNIGHTS OF THE WORLD AND HIS CASTLE IS HERE NIGH HAND BUT TWO MILE THEREFORE WE ADVISE YOU RIDE NOT AFTER SIR GRINGAMORE BUT IF YE OWE HIM GOOD WILL
TWO GENERATIONS OF PUBLIC MEN HAVE SINCE LABOURED WITH IMPERFECT SUCCESS TO REPAIR THE ERROR WHICH WAS THEN COMMITTED NOR IS IT IMPROBABLE THAT SOME OF THE PENALTIES OF THAT ERROR MAY CONTINUE TO AFFLICT A REMOTE POSTERITY THE BILL BY WHICH THE OATH WAS SETTLED PASSED THE UPPER HOUSE WITHOUT AMENDMENT
TILL THE CLERGY HAD HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF DECLARING THEIR OPINION THROUGH THE ANCIENT AND LEGITIMATE ORGAN THIS PROPOSITION WAS RECEIVED WITH GENERAL ACCLAMATION THE TORIES WERE WELL PLEASED TO SEE SUCH HONOUR DONE TO THE PRIESTHOOD
AND HURTLED TOGETHER THAT SOMETIME THEY FELL GROVELLING TO THE EARTH AND AT SOME TIME THEY WERE SO AMAZED THAT EITHER TOOK OTHER'S SWORD INSTEAD OF HIS OWN THUS THEY ENDURED TILL EVENSONG TIME THAT THERE WAS NONE THAT BEHELD THEM MIGHT KNOW WHETHER WAS LIKE TO WIN THE BATTLE AND THEIR ARMOUR WAS SO FORHEWN
BUT NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE MEMBERS WERE EITHER LOW CHURCHMEN OR NOT CHURCHMEN AT ALL A VERY FEW DAYS BEFORE THIS TIME AN OCCURRENCE HAD TAKEN PLACE UNIMPORTANT IN ITSELF BUT HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT AS AN INDICATION OF THE TEMPER OF THE MAJORITY
AND BUT IF THOU TELL ME SAID DAME LIONESSE THOU SHALT NEVER ESCAPE THIS CASTLE BUT EVER HERE TO BE PRISONER AS FOR THAT SAID THE DWARF I FEAR NOT GREATLY TO TELL HIS NAME AND OF WHAT KIN HE IS COME WIT YOU WELL HE IS A KING'S SON
IT SEEMETH BY YOU SAID KING ARTHUR THAT YE KNOW HIS NAME AND FROM WHENCE HE IS COME AND OF WHAT BLOOD HE IS I SUPPOSE I DO SO SAID LAUNCELOT OR ELSE I WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HIM THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD BUT HE GAVE ME SUCH CHARGE AT THAT TIME THAT I SHOULD NEVER DISCOVER HIM UNTIL HE REQUIRED ME
AND SO UPON THE MORROW HE TOOK HIS HORSE AND RODE UNTIL UNDERNE AND THEN HE CAME TO A BROAD WATER AND THEREBY WAS A GREAT LODGE AND THERE HE ALIGHTED TO SLEEP AND LAID HIS HEAD UPON THE SHIELD AND BETOOK HIS HORSE TO THE DWARF AND COMMANDED HIM TO WATCH ALL NIGHT
THE VIEWS OF LOUVOIS INCOMPARABLY THE GREATEST STATESMAN THAT FRANCE HAD PRODUCED SINCE RICHELIEU
AND THEREWITHAL SHE TURNED HER FROM THE WINDOW AND SIR BEAUMAINS RODE AWAYWARD FROM THE CASTLE MAKING GREAT DOLE AND SO HE RODE HERE AND THERE AND WIST NOT WHERE HE RODE TILL IT WAS DARK NIGHT AND THEN IT HAPPENED HIM TO COME TO A POOR MAN'S HOUSE AND THERE HE WAS HARBOURED ALL THAT NIGHT
ALL THE PREPARATIONS WERE COMPLETE AND ON THE ELEVENTH OF APRIL THE CORONATION TOOK PLACE IN SOME THINGS IT DIFFERED FROM ORDINARY CORONATIONS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE ATTENDED THE CEREMONY IN A BODY AND WERE SUMPTUOUSLY FEASTED IN THE EXCHEQUER CHAMBER
FOR I DARE SAY THERE WAS NEVER GENTLEWOMAN REVILED MAN IN SO FOUL A MANNER AS I HAVE REBUKED HIM AND AT ALL TIMES HE GAVE ME GOODLY AND MEEK ANSWERS AGAIN AND AS THEY SAT THUS TALKING
AND THERE THEY SOJOURNED TEN DAYS IN THEIR TENTS AND THE RED KNIGHT MADE HIS LORDS AND SERVANTS TO DO ALL THE PLEASURE THAT THEY MIGHT UNTO SIR BEAUMAINS
AND SO I ENSURED HER TO DO ALL THE VILLAINY UNTO KING ARTHUR'S KNIGHTS AND THAT I SHOULD TAKE VENGEANCE UPON ALL THESE KNIGHTS
AND AT NIGHT BONFIRES WERE LIGHTED ROCKETS DISCHARGED AND WINDOWS LIGHTED UP THE JACOBITES HOWEVER CONTRIVED TO DISCOVER OR TO INVENT ABUNDANT MATTER FOR SCURRILITY AND SARCASM THEY COMPLAINED BITTERLY THAT THE WAY FROM THE HALL TO THE WESTERN DOOR OF THE ABBEY HAD BEEN LINED BY DUTCH SOLDIERS
TILL YE MAY FIND HIM SLEEPING FOR I AM SURE IN HIS HEAVINESS HE WILL ALIGHT DOWN IN SOME PLACE AND LIE HIM DOWN TO SLEEP AND THEREFORE HAVE YE YOUR WAIT UPON HIM AND IN THE PRIVIEST MANNER YE CAN TAKE HIS DWARF AND GO YE YOUR WAY WITH HIM AS FAST AS EVER YE MAY OR SIR BEAUMAINS AWAKE
DANBY BECAME MARQUESS OF CAERMARTHEN CHURCHILL EARL OF MARLBOROUGH
PROBABLY FOR EVER THOSE WHIGS WHO WERE FOR THE COMPREHENSION BILL WERE WELL PLEASED TO ESCAPE WITHOUT A DEFEAT MANY OF THEM INDEED WERE NOT WITHOUT HOPES THAT MILD AND LIBERAL COUNSELS MIGHT PREVAIL IN THE ECCLESIASTICAL SENATE
LEAVE THY BOASTING WORDS FOR THOU GETTEST NOT THY DWARF AGAIN THOU COWARD KNIGHT SAID SIR GARETH BRING HIM WITH THEE AND COME AND DO BATTLE WITH ME AND WIN HIM AND TAKE HIM SO WILL I DO SAID SIR GRINGAMORE AN ME LIST BUT FOR ALL THY GREAT WORDS THOU GETTEST HIM NOT
AN ADDRESS REQUESTING WILLIAM TO SUMMON THE CONVOCATION WAS VOTED WITHOUT A DIVISION THE CONCURRENCE OF THE LORDS WAS ASKED THE LORDS CONCURRED THE ADDRESS WAS CARRIED UP TO THE THRONE BY BOTH HOUSES THE KING PROMISED THAT HE WOULD AT A CONVENIENT SEASON DO WHAT HIS PARLIAMENT DESIRED
UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD SEE REASON TO CALL ON HIM SPECIALLY FOR AN ASSURANCE OF HIS LOYALTY BURNETT HAD PARTLY NO DOUBT FROM THE GOODNATURE AND GENEROSITY WHICH BELONGED TO HIS CHARACTER AND PARTLY FROM A DESIRE TO CONCILIATE HIS BRETHREN
AND SHE PRAYED ME AS THAT I LOVED HER HEARTILY THAT I WOULD MAKE HER A PROMISE BY THE FAITH OF MY KNIGHTHOOD FOR TO LABOUR DAILY IN ARMS UNTO I MET WITH ONE OF THEM AND ALL THAT I MIGHT OVERCOME I SHOULD PUT THEM UNTO A VILLAINOUS DEATH AND THIS IS THE CAUSE THAT I HAVE PUT ALL THESE KNIGHTS TO DEATH
THE BEST THING THAT THE TWO REGIMENTS COULD DO WOULD BE TO SAIL BACK TO ENGLAND HE MEANT HE SAID TO WITHDRAW HIMSELF PRIVATELY AND THE INHABITANTS MUST THEN TRY TO MAKE GOOD TERMS FOR THEMSELVES
PERSONS WHOSE GRATITUDE MIGHT BE USEFUL IN THE EVENT OF A COUNTERREVOLUTION
AND WAS RAPIDLY PASSED THROUGH EVERY STAGE
MANY OF HIS OWN OFFICERS DECLARED THAT THEY NO LONGER THOUGHT THEMSELVES BOUND TO OBEY HIM VOICES WERE HEARD THREATENING SOME THAT HIS BRAINS SHOULD BE BLOWN OUT SOME THAT HE SHOULD BE HANGED ON THE WALLS
AND WITH A FIRE FROM THE NEAREST BASTION AN OFFICER OF HIS STAFF FELL DEAD BY HIS SIDE
HE WENT THROUGH THE FORM OF HOLDING A COUNCIL OF WAR BUT FROM THIS COUNCIL HE EXCLUDED ALL THOSE OFFICERS OF THE GARRISON WHOSE SENTIMENTS HE KNEW TO BE DIFFERENT FROM HIS OWN SOME WHO HAD ORDINARILY BEEN SUMMONED ON SUCH OCCASIONS AND WHO NOW CAME UNINVITED WERE THRUST OUT OF THE ROOM
AND THIS SIR GRINGAMORE'S ARMS WERE ALL BLACK AND THAT TO HIM LONGETH
HE TALKED SO DESPONDINGLY THAT THE CITIZENS AND HIS OWN SOLDIERS MURMURED AGAINST HIM HE SEEMED THEY SAID TO BE BENT ON DISCOURAGING THEM MEANWHILE THE ENEMY DREW DAILY NEARER AND NEARER
HIS GRAVE AND ELOQUENT DISCOURSE WAS POLLUTED NEITHER BY ADULATION NOR BY MALIGNITY
AGAINST A TUMULTUARY ATTACK OF THE CELTIC PEASANTRY AVAUX ASSURED LOUVOIS THAT A SINGLE FRENCH BATTALION WOULD EASILY STORM SUCH DEFENCES EVEN IF THE PLACE SHOULD NOTWITHSTANDING ALL DISADVANTAGES BE ABLE TO REPEL A LARGE ARMY
BUT IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE HOUSE OF BOURBON ABOUT THE SCOTCH AND ENGLISH EXILES AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT MELFORT
I WILL WELL SAID THE KNIGHT AND THEN THEY LACED UP THEIR HELMS AND THEIR PAGES AVOIDED AND THEY STEPPED TOGETHER AND FOUGHT FRESHLY BUT THE RED KNIGHT OF THE RED LAUNDS AWAITED HIM AND AT AN OVERTHWART SMOTE HIM WITHIN THE HAND THAT HIS SWORD FELL OUT OF HIS HAND
HIS MAJESTY HAD ONLY TO APPEAR BEFORE THE GATES AND THEY WOULD INSTANTLY FLY OPEN JAMES NOW CHANGED HIS MIND AGAIN BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING BEEN PERSUADED TO TURN HIS FACE SOUTHWARD AND THOUGH IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING CALLED FOR HIS HORSES THE HORSES WERE IN A MISERABLE PLIGHT
FOR I SHALL BE SOUGHT AND FOUND IF THAT I BE ALIVE AND THEN THE NOBLE KNIGHT SIR GARETH WENT UNTO THE DAME LIONESSE WHICH HE THEN MUCH LOVED AND KISSED HER MANY TIMES AND EITHER MADE GREAT JOY OF OTHER AND THERE SHE PROMISED HIM HER LOVE CERTAINLY TO LOVE HIM AND NONE OTHER THE DAYS OF HER LIFE
AH FAIR BROTHER SAID DAME LIONESSE I WOULD HE HAD HIS DWARF AGAIN FOR I WOULD HE WERE NOT WROTH FOR NOW HE HATH TOLD ME ALL MY DESIRE I KEEP NO MORE OF THE DWARF AND ALSO BROTHER HE HATH DONE MUCH FOR ME AND DELIVERED ME FROM THE RED KNIGHT OF THE RED LAUNDS
AND THEN THEY STOOD WAGGING AND SCATTERING PANTING BLOWING AND BLEEDING THAT ALL THAT BEHELD THEM FOR THE MOST PART WEPT FOR PITY SO WHEN THEY HAD RESTED THEM A WHILE THEY YEDE TO BATTLE AGAIN TRACING RACING FOINING AS TWO BOARS
AND THEN HE YIELDED HIM AND ASKED MERCY AND SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE O NOBLE KNIGHT I YIELD ME TO THY MERCY THEN SIR BEAUMAINS BETHOUGHT HIM UPON THE KNIGHTS THAT HE HAD MADE TO BE HANGED SHAMEFULLY AND THEN HE SAID I MAY NOT WITH MY WORSHIP SAVE THY LIFE
BE NOT DISPLEASED NOR OVER HASTY FOR WIT YOU WELL YOUR GREAT TRAVAIL NOR GOOD LOVE SHALL NOT BE LOST FOR I CONSIDER YOUR GREAT TRAVAIL AND LABOUR YOUR BOUNTY AND YOUR GOODNESS AS ME OUGHT TO DO
LUNDY HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FIRING BUT HIS AUTHORITY WAS AT AN END TWO GALLANT SOLDIERS MAJOR HENRY BAKER AND CAPTAIN ADAM MURRAY CALLED THE PEOPLE TO ARMS THEY WERE ASSISTED BY THE ELOQUENCE OF AN AGED CLERGYMAN GEORGE WALKER RECTOR OF THE PARISH OF DONAGHMORE
CUNNINGHAM AND SEVERAL OF HIS OFFICERS WENT ON SHORE AND CONFERRED WITH LUNDY LUNDY DISSUADED THEM FROM LANDING THEIR MEN THE PLACE HE SAID COULD NOT HOLD OUT TO THROW MORE TROOPS INTO IT WOULD THEREFORE BE WORSE THAN USELESS
THE ANCIENT USAGE WAS THAT A CONVOCATION SHOULD BE SUMMONED TOGETHER WITH A PARLIAMENT AND IT MIGHT WELL BE ARGUED THAT IF EVER THE ADVICE OF A CONVOCATION COULD BE NEEDED
WHO THRICE FLUNG DOWN HIS GLOVE ON THE PAVEMENT AND THRICE DEFIED TO MORTAL COMBAT THE FALSE TRAITOR WHO SHOULD GAINSAY THE TITLE OF WILLIAM AND MARY AMONG THE NOBLE DAMSELS WHO SUPPORTED THE GORGEOUS TRAIN OF THE QUEEN WAS HER BEAUTIFUL AND GENTLE COUSIN THE LADY HENRIETTA HYDE WHOSE FATHER ROCHESTER
FOR THE SHAMEFUL DEATHS THAT THOU HAST CAUSED MANY FULL GOOD KNIGHTS TO DIE SIR SAID THE RED KNIGHT OF THE RED LAUNDS HOLD YOUR HAND AND YE SHALL KNOW THE CAUSES WHY I PUT THEM TO SO SHAMEFUL A DEATH SAY ON SAID SIR BEAUMAINS
SOME HAVE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A CONCEALED JACOBITE AND THAT HE HAD AFFECTED TO ACQUIESCE IN THE REVOLUTION ONLY IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BE BETTER ABLE TO ASSIST IN BRINGING ABOUT A RESTORATION BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT HIS CONDUCT
IS YOURS AT ALL TIMES HER WORSHIP SAVED FOR WIT YE WELL SHE LOVETH YOU AS WELL AS YE DO HER AND BETTER IF BETTER MAY BE AN I WIST THAT SAID SIR GARETH THERE LIVED NOT A GLADDER MAN THAN I WOULD BE UPON MY WORSHIP SAID SIR GRINGAMORE TRUST UNTO MY PROMISE
ON THE OTHER SIDE SPRAT BISHOP OF ROCHESTER LATELY A MEMBER OF THE HIGH COMMISSION HAD CHARGE OF THE CHALICE BURNET THE JUNIOR PRELATE PREACHED WITH ALL HIS WONTED ABILITY AND MORE THAN HIS WONTED TASTE AND JUDGMENT
ONE BRAVE SOLDIER MURMURED UNDERSTAND THIS HE SAID TO GIVE UP LONDONDERRY
FAIR BROTHER SAID DAME LIONESSE I UNDERSTAND WELL THAT THE KNIGHT IS GOOD AND COME HE IS OF A NOBLE HOUSE
AS SOON AS LONDONDERRY HAD FALLEN AND IT WAS UNIVERSALLY SUPPOSED THAT THE FALL OF LONDONDERRY COULD NOT BE LONG DELAYED HE MIGHT CROSS THE SEA WITH PART OF HIS FORCES AND LAND IN SCOTLAND WHERE HIS FRIENDS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE NUMEROUS WHEN HE WAS ONCE ON BRITISH GROUND AND IN THE MIDST OF BRITISH ADHERENTS
THE BEST THING LOUVOIS WROTE THAT KING JAMES COULD DO WOULD BE TO FORGET THAT HE HAD REIGNED IN GREAT BRITAIN AND TO THINK ONLY OF PUTTING IRELAND INTO A GOOD CONDITION AND OF ESTABLISHING HIMSELF FIRMLY THERE WHETHER THIS WERE THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE HOUSE OF STUART MAY BE DOUBTED
IT WAS REMARKED THAT THE NAME OF HALIFAX DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LIST OF PROMOTIONS NONE COULD DOUBT THAT HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE OBTAINED EITHER A BLUE RIBAND OR A DUCAL CORONET AND THOUGH HE WAS HONOURABLY DISTINGUISHED FROM MOST OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES BY HIS SCORN OF ILLICIT GAIN
HOUSES WERE DRAPED IN BLACK BELLS TOLLED IN ALL THE CHURCHES
THE ACADEMY OF COPENHAGEN NOW SENT HIM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AS AN EXPRESSION OF THEIR PRIDE IN HIM HOW MUCH MORE HE NEEDED IT WHEN HE WAS NEAR STARVING ALL THOSE NINE YEARS IN ROME
THE MATTER WAS TALKED OVER AT SOME LENGTH AND IT WAS FINALLY DECIDED
VERY LIKELY HIS CREW BETRAYED HIM ADDED HATTERAS THE SAILORS DARED NOT RAISE THEIR EYES THESE WORDS PRICKED THEIR CONSCIENCE
AND SAID HE HAD TWO PISTOLS AND CARTER HAD THE SAME ONE OF THE EXTRA WEAPONS WAS LOANED TO DICK AND THE SECOND WENT TO TOM IT WAS DECIDED
WHAT VISIONS OF FAME MUST HAVE COME BEFORE HIM NOW AS HE SAID GOOD BY TO HIS POOR PARENTS WHOM ALAS HE WAS NEVER TO SEE AGAIN AND TAKING HIS LITTLE DOG HECTOR STARTED FOR FAR AWAY ITALY
WORN OUT BY FATIGUE AND SUFFERING LATER ON THEY DISCOVERED THIRTY CORPSES ON THE CONTINENT AND FIVE ON A NEIGHBOURING ISLAND SOME HALF BURIED SOME LEFT WITHOUT BURIAL
AND HOW FAR ARE WE OUT WAS THE POLICE SERGEANT'S QUESTION BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX MILES AS NEAR AS I CAN CALCULATE WILL THEY BE ABLE TO RUN IN BY DARK I THINK SO
PERCEIVED THE TWO SHIPS IN MELVILLE BAY FOR THE LAST TIME AND AFTER THAT DAY NOTHING WAS HEARD OF THEM HOWEVER WE CAN FOLLOW FRANKLIN IN HIS WESTERLY COURSE HE PASSED THROUGH LANCASTER AND BARROW STRAITS
AN ARTIST COULD NOT LIVE ON PRAISE ALONE
AND THE COAST WITH ITS BAYS CAPES AND PROMONTORIES
AND THE FACT WAS MENTIONED IN THE NEWSPAPERS THE NEXT DAY ONE OF THE TEACHERS ASKED THORWALDSEN IS IT YOUR BROTHER WHO HAS CARRIED OFF THE PRIZE BERTEL'S CHEEKS COLORED WITH PRIDE AS HE SAID NO SIR IT IS I
WAS SERGEANT BROWN'S COMMENT THE WHOLE THING MAY BE A TRICK TO GET US TO GO TO SAND HAVEN
ENTRY OF ALEXANDER INTO BABYLON AND SOON AFTER HIS EXQUISITE BAS RELIEFS NIGHT AND MORNING THE FORMER A GODDESS CARRYING IN HER ARMS TWO CHILDREN SLEEP AND DEATH THE LATTER
YOU SHOULD ASK EIGHT SAID THE GENEROUS MAN WHO AT ONCE ORDERED IT AND THIS WAS THE TURNING POINT IN BERTEL'S LIFE HOW OFTEN A RICH MAN MIGHT HELP A STRUGGLING ARTIST AND SAVE A GENIUS TO THE WORLD
AND ONE WAS LOST AT SEA A YEAR LATER HE CARVED HIS EXQUISITE BYRON NOW AT TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE HE WAS NOW MADE A MEMBER OF THREE OTHER FAMOUS ACADEMIES
CONTAINED THE INFORMATION THAT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THE ESQUIMAUX HAD MET ON KING WILLIAM'S LAND A DETACHMENT OF FORTY MEN TRAVELLING ON THE ICE AND DRAGGING A BOAT THIN EMACIATED
I NEVER THOUGHT OF HER POOR GIRL REPLIED THE BROTHER DICK AND SERGEANT BROWN WERE WELL UP IN THE BOW ONE WATCHING TO STARBOARD AND THE OTHER TO PORT FOR ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT APPEAR THROUGH THE GLOOM
AND HELPED ILLUSTRATE BOOKS WORKING FROM EARLY MORNING TILL LATE AT NIGHT HE WAS RARELY SEEN TO SMILE SO HARD WAS THE STRUGGLE FOR DAILY BREAD BUT HE TRIED FOR THE MEDAL AND WON
HAVE YOU DROPPED SOMETHING THE GREAT MAN MADE NO ANSWER HE WAS DEAD THE FUNERAL WAS A GRAND EXPRESSION OF LOVE AND HONOR HIS BODY LAY IN STATE IN THE ROYAL PALACE
AND RAN TO WHERE HE COULD NOT BE SEEN FROM THE OTHER YACHT HE PULLED FROM THE SEASHELL A SMALL SQUARE OF PAPER UPON WHICH HAD BEEN HASTILY SCRAWLED THE FOLLOWING IN LEAD PENCIL I WILL HELP YOU ALL
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW LET ME STATE THAT A TRAMP STEAMER IS ONE GOING FROM ONE PORT TO ANOTHER REGARDLESS OF ANY REGULAR ROUTE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE CRAFT DEPENDING ENTIRELY UPON THE FREIGHT TO BE PICKED UP
TO WORK THE SAWS AND USE PETARDS AND THEY WERE WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE HAPPILY THE TEMPERATURE WAS BEARABLE
GRACIOUS SUPPOSING WE GET CAUGHT IN A FOG MUTTERED TOM I WAS JUST THINKING OF IT RETURNED HIS ELDER BROTHER THERE WILL BE NO FUN IN IT IF WE ARE OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND
AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO SEE A DOZEN YARDS IN ANY DIRECTION THIS IS THE WORST YET GROANED SAM WHAT'S TO DO NOW YES WHAT'S TO DO NOW REPEATED SERGEANT BROWN CAN YOU MAKE THE COAST SKIPPER
IT WAS GROWING CLOUDY AND A MIST WAS RISING THE MIST MADE MARTIN HARRIS SHAKE HIS HEAD BUT NOT WISHING TO ALARM THE OTHERS HE SAID NOTHING BUT SOON DICK NOTICED THE MIST AND SO DID THE REST
THE WHOLE CITY WAITED NEARLY THREE DAYS FOR HIS COMING BOATS DECKED WITH FLOWERS WENT OUT TO MEET HIM AND SO MANY CROWDED ON BOARD HIS VESSEL THAT IT WAS FEARED SHE WOULD SINK
TO THINK OF HOW SHE MIGHT BE SUFFERING MILE AFTER MILE WAS PASSED UNTIL THE SUN BEGAN TO DESCEND OVER TO THE WESTWARD THE YACHTS WERE NOW CLOSE ON TO QUARTER OF A MILE APART
FOLLOWED BY A CONSTANT ROUND OF PARTIES SO BESET WAS HE WITH INVITATIONS TO DINNER THAT TO SAVE A LITTLE TIME FOR HIMSELF HE TOLD HIS SERVANT WILKINS THAT HE WOULD DINE WITH HIM AND HIS WIFE
A GODDESS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR SCATTERING FLOWERS WITH BOTH HANDS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN WHEN HE WAS FORTY SIX HE FINISHED HIS VENUS AFTER HAVING MADE THIRTY MODELS OF THE FIGURE
GOOD FOR MUMPS HE'S COMING TO HIS SENSES CRIED SAM AND SHOWED THE OTHERS THE MESSAGE DICK READ THE WORDS WITH MUCH SATISFACTION I HOPE HE DOES STAND BY DORA HE SAID
THE MEMBERS OF THE ACADEMY CAME IN A BODY AND THE CROWD TOOK THE HORSES FROM THE CARRIAGE AND DREW IT THEMSELVES THROUGH THE STREETS TO THE PALACE OF CHARLOTTENBURG IN THE EVENING THERE WAS A GRAND TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION
FROM A DARK LOOKING MAN ON THE FORWARD DECK CAN'T YOU TALK ENGLISH CRIED DICK A LEETLE WE ARE AFTER THAT OTHER SAIL BOAT
PERHAPS THE FOG WILL LIFT SUGGESTED CARTER A FOG LIKE THIS ISN'T LIFTING IN A HURRY SAID DICK LIKE AS NOT IT WON'T MOVE UNTIL THE SUN COMES UP TOMORROW MORNING AND IN THIS GUESS HE WAS RIGHT
AFTER HAVING EMPLOYED HIS YOUTH IN GREAT MARITIME EXPEDITIONS HE RESOLVED IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE TO LAUNCH OUT IN SEARCH OF THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE HE COMMANDED THE EREBUS AND THE TERROR TWO VESSELS
WHEN HE ARRIVED HE WAS SO ILL AND HOMESICK THAT SEVERAL TIMES HE DECIDED TO GIVE UP ART AND GO BACK
SHE SEES THE SIGNAL EXCLAIMED DICK AFTER AN ANXIOUS WAIT OF SEVERAL MINUTES SLOWLY THE STEAMER CAME UP TO THEM AND THEN HER PONDEROUS ENGINES CEASED TO WORK WHAT IS WANTED CAME IN SPANISH
AND TRIED IN VAIN TO EARN A LITTLE MONEY HE SENT SOME SMALL WORKS OF HIS OWN TO COPENHAGEN BUT NOBODY BOUGHT THEM HE MADE JASON WITH THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND WHEN NO ONE ORDERED IT
THE BASHFUL STUDENT HAD BECOME THE GENIAL COMPANION AND INTERESTING TALKER LOUIS OF BAVARIA WHO MADE MUNICH ONE OF THE ART CENTRES OF THE WORLD WAS HIS ADMIRER AND FRIEND
I CAN AND HOPE YOU WON'T PROSECUTE ME I WILL SEE THAT DORA S GETS SOMETHING TO EAT EVEN IF I GIVE HER MY SHARE THEY INTEND TO GO TO SAND HAVEN IF THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE SLIP
WELL I DECLARE BURST OUT TOM THEY ARE AFTER A REWARD THE FIRST THING NO REWARD YET ANSWERED DICK BUT THERE MAY BE AT THIS THE SOUTH AMERICAN SCOWLED
HAVING BEEN ABSENT FROM DENMARK TWENTY THREE YEARS THE KING URGED HIS RETURN FOR A VISIT AT LEAST
I'LL GET THE HORN AND RUNNING BELOW HE BROUGHT IT UP AND HE AND SAM TOOK TURNS AT BLOWING IT WITH ALL THE STRENGTH OF THEIR LUNGS ONE THING IS COMFORTING THOSE RASCALS ARE NO BETTER OFF THAN WE ARE
WITH FITZ JAMES AS CAPTAIN GORE AND LE VESCONTE LIEUTENANTS
WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED UNDER HIS OWN HAND A LOW GRANITE COPING SURROUNDS THE GRAVE WHICH IS ENTIRELY COVERED WITH IVY
THINKING HIS BOY WOULD BE A MORE SKILFUL WORKMAN IF HE LEARNED TO DRAW SENT HIM TO THE FREE ROYAL ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS WHEN HE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
YOU CAN'T DO IT ANY TOO QUICK ANSWERED DICK WHEN NEXT WE MEET THERE WON'T BE QUITE SO MUCH TALKING INSTEAD WE'LL HAVE SOME ACTING AND PRETTY LIVELY AT THAT SERGEANT BROWN WAS QUESTIONED CONCERNING HIS WEAPONS
AS DID THIS BANKER YOUNG THORWALDSEN NOW MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE DANISH AMBASSADOR TO NAPLES WHO INTRODUCED HIM TO THE FAMILY OF BARON WILHELM VON HUMBOLDT
IF HE TELLS THE TRUTH WE MAY AS WELL PUT INTO HARBOR AND MAKE FOR SAND HAVEN SAID MARTIN HARRIS WHO HAD NOW RESUMED THE CHASE ONCE MORE YES
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WENT BY AND STILL NO LAND APPEARED IT WAS NOW SO RAW THAT THE BOYS WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO BUTTON THEIR COATS TIGHTLY ABOUT THEM THEN OF A SUDDEN
LET US HOPE FOR THE BEST PUT IN SAM
LIEUTENANTS LITTLE HODGSON AND IRVING HORESBY AND THOMAS WERE THE BOATSWAINS AND PEDDIE THE SURGEON IN THE NAMES ON THE MAP OF THE CAPES STRAITS POINTS AND CHANNELS YOU MAY READ THOSE OF THESE UNFORTUNATE MEN
THAT IS WHAT BECAME OF THEM ON THE SOUTHERN ROUTE WELL DO YOU STILL WISH TO MARCH IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS HIS TREMBLING VOICE HIS PASSIONATE GESTURES AND BEAMING FACE PRODUCED AN
HE WOULD RECEIVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THREE YEARS AND STUDY ART IN ITALY HE AT ONCE BEGAN TO GIVE DRAWING LESSONS
HATTERAS WAS RIGHT WHEN HE COUNTED UPON A MORE OPEN SEA HE FOLLOWED UP THE SUPPOSED ROUTE TAKEN BY FRANKLIN SAILING ALONG THE WESTERN COAST OF PRINCE OF WALES'S LAND
VISITING ON THE WAY ALEXANDER OF RUSSIA WHO AFTER THORWALDSEN HAD MADE HIS BUST PRESENTED THE ARTIST WITH A DIAMOND RING ALTHOUGH A PROTESTANT ACCOUNTED NOW THE GREATEST LIVING SCULPTOR
AFTER THEY HAD LOST THEIR CHIEF THEY REMAINED ON BOARD THEIR VESSELS AND ONLY RESOLVED TO ABANDON THEM IN APRIL EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT A HUNDRED AND FIVE MEN OUT OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT WERE STILL LIVING
AND IT DEPENDS A GOOD BIT ON HOW MUCH IT VEERS AROUND CONCLUDED THE OLD SAILOR
ANYTHING THAT WAS HANDY BUT OTHERWISE THEY WERE TO ATTEND TO THE SAILING OF THE SEARCHLIGHT PROVISIONS TO USE TOM'S WAY OF EXPRESSING IT WERE NOW
AND AS THEY ATE THE SCANT FOOD DEALT AROUND DICK COULD NOT HELP BUT THINK OF HOW DORA MIGHT BE FARING I'D WILLINGLY STARVE MYSELF IF ONLY IT WOULD GIVE HER WHAT SHE NEEDS HE THOUGHT IT MADE HIM SICK AT HEART
AND A LOADED GUN AT HIS SIDE FURTHER ON A BOILER WITH THE REMNANTS OF A HORRIBLE MEAL WHEN THE ADMIRALTY RECEIVED THESE TIDINGS IT BEGGED THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY
OF THE FOX WHICH BEARS THE DATE OF APRIL TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT WE KNOW THAT AFTER THEIR WINTERING THE EREBUS AND THE TERROR WENT UP WELLINGTON STRAIT AS FAR AS THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL
WAS TOM'S COMMENT YES BUT IF THEY FOUNDER WHAT WILL BECOME OF DORA I DON'T BELIEVE ANY ONE OF THEM WOULD PUT HIMSELF OUT TO SAVE HER I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT THERE DICK
SAID THE DOCTOR POINTING TO A PART OF THE SEA NOW HE CONTINUED THE SHIPS WERE NOT ABANDONED TILL THE TWENTY SECOND OF APRIL EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT
THE DANISH KING URGED HIM TO RETURN TO COPENHAGEN BUT AS THE QUIRINAL WAS TO BE DECORATED WITH GREAT MAGNIFICENCE ROME COULD NOT SPARE HIM FOR THIS HE MADE IN THREE MONTHS HIS FAMOUS
SEVERAL OF THEM BELL BOLTON AND SIMPSON APPROACHED AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM THEIR COMRADES ANIMATED BY CURIOSITY SOON FOLLOWED THEM WHILE THE BRIG FLEW ALONG WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY
A FEW MONTHS AGO WE VISITED A PLAIN OLD HOUSE IN COPENHAGEN THE BOYHOOD HOME OF THE GREAT DANISH SCULPTOR HERE HE WORKED WITH HIS FATHER A POOR WOOD CARVER WHO
WILKINS GREATLY CONFUSED REPLIED WHAT WOULD THE WORLD THINK IF IT FOUND OUT THAT THE CHANCELLOR DINED WITH HIS SERVANT THE WORLD THE WORLD HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU A THOUSAND TIMES
A FLAG WAS RUN UP AS HIGH AS THE TOPMAST PERMITTED AND THEY HEADED DIRECTLY FOR THE STEAMER'S COURSE
AND THERE DEPOSITED THEIR LAST DOCUMENT SEE MY FRIENDS WE ARE PASSING THE POINT NOW YOU CAN STILL SEE THE REMAINS OF THE CAIRN PLACED ON THE EXTREME POINT REACHED BY JOHN ROSS IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE
SO SAYING HATTERAS GAVE ORDERS TO TURN THE VESSEL THE SAILORS WENT TO WORK WITH ALACRITY THE ICE STREAMS GOT CLEAR LITTLE BY LITTLE THE FORWARD WITH ALL STEAM ON MADE FOR MC CLINTOCK CHANNEL
THAT I DON'T CARE IN THE LEAST WHAT THE WORLD THINKS ABOUT THESE THINGS SOMETIMES HE REFUSED EVEN TO DINE WITH THE KING FINDING AT LAST THAT SOCIETY WOULD GIVE HIM NO REST
AND YET THERE WAS NO WIND IT DIED AWAY INTO PROFOUND STILLNESS BETWEEN WHILES FANNY CAME IN AT LAST MAMMA WILL COME DIRECTLY MISS HALE SHE DESIRED ME TO APOLOGISE TO YOU AS IT IS
AND SHE GLANCED UP AT JANE AS IF SHRINKING FROM HER INSPECTION MORE THAN FROM THE DOCTOR'S
SHE SAW THEIR GESTURE SHE KNEW ITS MEANING SHE READ THEIR AIM ANOTHER MOMENT AND MISTER THORNTON MIGHT BE SMITTEN DOWN HE WHOM SHE HAD URGED AND GOADED TO COME TO THIS PERILOUS PLACE SHE ONLY THOUGHT HOW SHE COULD SAVE HIM SHE THREW HER ARMS AROUND HIM
INARTICULATELY AS HE SPOKE KNEELING BY HER AND RATHER MOANING THAN SAYING THE WORDS HE STARTED UP ASHAMED OF HIMSELF AS HIS MOTHER CAME IN SHE SAW NOTHING BUT HER SON A LITTLE PALER
IN FIVE MINUTES MORE I ONLY HOPE MY POOR IRISHMEN ARE NOT TERRIFIED OUT OF THEIR WITS BY SUCH A FIENDLIKE NOISE
IN FACE OF THAT ANGRY SEA OF MEN HER EYES SMITING THEM WITH FLAMING ARROWS OF REPROACH THE CLOGS WERE ARRESTED IN THE HANDS THAT HELD THEM THE COUNTENANCES SO FELL NOT A MOMENT BEFORE NOW LOOKED IRRESOLUTE AND AS IF ASKING WHAT THIS MEANT
HITHERTO THEY HAD BEEN VOICELESS WORDLESS NEEDING ALL THEIR BREATH FOR THEIR HARD LABOURING EFFORTS TO BREAK DOWN THE GATES BUT NOW HEARING HIM SPEAK INSIDE THEY SET UP SUCH A FIERCE UNEARTHLY GROAN
THE DISTANT CLANK OF THE SOLDIERS WAS HEARD JUST FIVE MINUTES TOO LATE TO MAKE THIS VANISHED MOB FEEL THE POWER OF AUTHORITY AND ORDER
NOW IF YOU PLEASE SAID SHE I MUST GO MAMMA WILL NOT SEE IT I THINK IT IS UNDER THE HAIR IS IT NOT QUITE NO ONE COULD TELL BUT YOU MUST NOT GO SAID MISSUS THORNTON IMPATIENTLY YOU ARE NOT FIT TO GO
AND NOW HER VOICE WAS LIKE A CRY
HER EYE LIDS ARE QUIVERING AND HERE'S WET TEARS A COMING DOWN HER CHEEKS
INNOCENT STRANGER YOU FALL YOU HUNDREDS ON ONE MAN AND WHEN A WOMAN COMES BEFORE YOU TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR OWN SAKES TO BE REASONABLE CREATURES
DID SHE GET THERE NAY MISS THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY ANSWERED JANE WITH A SLIGHT TOSS OF HER HEAD SARAH DID' SARAH WHAT SAID FANNY WITH IMPATIENT CURIOSITY
MARGARET HAD ALWAYS DREADED LEST HER COURAGE SHOULD FAIL HER IN ANY EMERGENCY AND SHE SHOULD BE PROVED TO BE
IT IS AWFUL TO SEE THEM THE SOLDIERS WILL BE HERE DIRECTLY AND THAT WILL BRING THEM TO REASON TO REASON SAID MARGARET QUICKLY WHAT KIND OF REASON THE ONLY REASON THAT DOES WITH MEN THAT MAKE THEMSELVES INTO WILD BEASTS

FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOWING HER TERROR IN THE TONES OF HER VOICE SHUT DOWN THE WINDOWS INSTANTLY MOTHER EXCLAIMED HE THE GATES WON'T BEAR SUCH ANOTHER SHOCK SHUT DOWN THAT WINDOW MISS HALE
AND THE PEOPLE WERE RAGING WORSE THAN EVER
HE HOPED THEY WOULD SEE THE TROOPS AND BE QUELLED BY THE THOUGHT OF THEIR NARROW ESCAPE WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED HIS MIND MARGARET CLUNG TO THE DOORPOST TO STEADY HERSELF BUT A FILM CAME OVER HER EYES
COME DOWN THEY ARE GONE AND MISS HALE IS HURT HE BORE HER INTO THE DINING ROOM AND LAID HER ON THE SOFA THERE LAID HER DOWN SOFTLY
BUT THAT GIRL MUST NOT BLEED TO DEATH BLEED OH HOW HORRID HOW
YOU DO WELL THEY WERE SILENT WHILE HE SPOKE THEY WERE WATCHING OPEN EYED AND OPEN MOUTHED THE THREAD OF DARK RED BLOOD WHICH WAKENED THEM UP FROM THEIR TRANCE OF PASSION
THAT IN AN INSTANT ALL WOULD BE UPROAR THE FIRST TOUCH WOULD CAUSE AN EXPLOSION IN WHICH AMONG SUCH HUNDREDS OF INFURIATED MEN AND RECKLESS BOYS EVEN MISTER THORNTON'S LIFE WOULD BE UNSAFE
I'M SORRY MISS HALE YOU HAVE VISITED US AT THIS UNFORTUNATE MOMENT WHEN I FEAR YOU MAY BE INVOLVED IN WHATEVER RISK WE HAVE TO BEAR MOTHER HADN'T YOU BETTER GO INTO THE BACK ROOMS
SHE THREW THE WINDOW WIDE OPEN MANY IN THE CROWD WERE MERE BOYS CRUEL AND THOUGHTLESS CRUEL BECAUSE THEY WERE THOUGHTLESS SOME WERE MEN GAUNT AS WOLVES AND MAD FOR PREY SHE KNEW HOW IT WAS
NO JANE IF YOU DON'T GO I DO MISSUS THORNTON WENT FIRST TO THE ROOM IN WHICH SHE HAD LEFT FANNY STRETCHED ON THE BED SHE STARTED UP AS HER MOTHER ENTERED OH MAMMA HOW YOU TERRIFIED ME
SHE COULD ONLY SEE FOR IF MISTER THORNTON HAD INDEED MADE THE ATTEMPT TO SPEAK
WHERE WAS SHE THEN SAID FANNY DRAWING NEARER BY SLOW DEGREES AS SHE BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE SIGHT OF MARGARET'S PALE FACE JUST BEFORE THE FRONT DOOR WITH MASTER SAID JANE SIGNIFICANTLY
THAT IN ANOTHER INSTANT THE STORMY PASSIONS WOULD HAVE PASSED THEIR BOUNDS AND SWEPT AWAY ALL BARRIERS OF REASON OR APPREHENSION OF CONSEQUENCE EVEN WHILE SHE LOOKED
MARGARET KNEW IT ALL SHE READ IT IN BOUCHER'S FACE FORLORNLY DESPERATE AND LIVID WITH RAGE IF MISTER THORNTON WOULD BUT SAY SOMETHING TO THEM LET THEM HEAR HIS VOICE ONLY
SLOWER PLASH THAN EVEN TEARS CAME THE DRIP OF BLOOD FROM HER WOUND EVEN THE MOST DESPERATE BOUCHER HIMSELF DREW BACK FALTERED AWAY SCOWLED AND FINALLY WENT OFF
THAT SHE WOULD ASK FOR WHATEVER THEY MIGHT WANT IN THE PROGRESS OF HER MOTHER'S ILLNESS MISSUS THORNTON'S BROW CONTRACTED AND HER MOUTH GREW SET WHILE MARGARET SPOKE WITH GENTLE MODESTY OF HER MOTHER'S RESTLESSNESS AND DOCTOR DONALDSON'S WISH
GRAZING FOREHEAD AND CHEEK AND DRAWING A BLINDING SHEET OF LIGHT BEFORE HER EYES SHE LAY LIKE ONE DEAD ON MISTER THORNTON'S SHOULDER THEN HE UNFOLDED HIS ARMS AND HELD HER ENCIRCLED IN ONE FOR AN INSTANT
FOR THERE WAS NO TONE IN HER VOICE IT WAS BUT A HOARSE WHISPER MISTER THORNTON STOOD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE HE HAD MOVED AWAY FROM BEHIND HER AS IF JEALOUS OF ANYTHING THAT SHOULD COME BETWEEN HIM AND DANGER GO
WHEN CAN THE SOLDIERS BE HERE ASKED HIS MOTHER IN A LOW BUT NOT UNSTEADY VOICE HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH
WELL MISS SINCE YOU WILL HAVE IT SARAH YOU SEE WAS IN THE BEST PLACE FOR SEEING BEING AT THE RIGHT HAND WINDOW AND SHE SAYS AND SAID AT THE VERY TIME TOO THAT SHE SAW MISS HALE WITH HER ARMS ABOUT MASTER'S NECK
BUT IT WAS EVIDENT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS NOR WHO THEY WERE THE DARK CIRCLES DEEPENED THE LIPS QUIVERED AND CONTRACTED AND SHE BECAME INSENSIBLE ONCE MORE
THOSE NEAREST THE GATE STOLE OUT ASHAMED THERE WAS A MOVEMENT THROUGH ALL THE CROWD A RETREATING MOVEMENT
HE DARTED UP THE STEPS TO MARGARET SHE TRIED TO RISE WITHOUT HIS HELP IT IS NOTHING SHE SAID WITH A SICKLY SMILE THE SKIN IS GRAZED AND I WAS STUNNED AT THE MOMENT OH I AM SO THANKFUL THEY ARE GONE
HE MADE SOME LITTLE CALCULATION SUPPOSING WILLIAMS GOT STRAIGHT OFF WHEN I TOLD HIM AND HADN'T TO DODGE ABOUT AMONGST THEM
DID THEY THROW STONES INTO THE DRAWING ROOM MARGARET DID INDEED LOOK WHITE AND WAN ALTHOUGH HER SENSES WERE BEGINNING TO RETURN TO HER BUT THE SICKLY DAZE OF THE SWOON MADE HER STILL MISERABLY FAINT
AND THE FIERCE GROWL OF LOW DEEP ANGRY VOICES THAT HAD A FEROCIOUS MURMUR OF SATISFACTION IN THEM MORE DREADFUL THAN THEIR BAFFLED CRIES NOT MANY MINUTES BEFORE NEVER MIND SAID HE THINKING TO ENCOURAGE HER
AND OF REFRESHMENT FROM THE EAU DE COLOGNE AND A CRAVING FOR THE BATHING TO GO ON WITHOUT INTERMISSION BUT WHEN THEY STOPPED TO TALK SHE COULD NO MORE HAVE OPENED HER EYES OR SPOKEN TO ASK FOR MORE BATHING THAN THE PEOPLE WHO LIE IN DEATH LIKE TRANCE CAN MOVE OR UTTER SOUND
HER HEAD LEANING AGAINST THE FRAME CAN YOU REST THERE HE ASKED BUT WITHOUT WAITING FOR HER ANSWER HE WENT SLOWLY DOWN THE STEPS RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD NOW KILL ME IF IT IS YOUR BRUTAL WILL
THERE IS NO WOMAN TO SHIELD ME HERE YOU MAY BEAT ME TO DEATH YOU WILL NEVER MOVE ME FROM WHAT I HAVE DETERMINED UPON NOT YOU HE STOOD AMONGST THEM WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED IN PRECISELY THE SAME ATTITUDE
THEY WERE LIKE BOUCHER WITH STARVING CHILDREN AT HOME RELYING ON ULTIMATE SUCCESS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO GET HIGHER WAGES AND ENRAGED BEYOND MEASURE AT DISCOVERING THAT IRISHMEN WERE TO BE BROUGHT IN TO ROB THEIR LITTLE ONES OF BREAD
FOR SHE STOOD BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR ENEMY SHE COULD NOT SPEAK BUT HELD OUT HER ARMS TOWARDS THEM TILL SHE COULD RECOVER BREATH OH DO NOT USE VIOLENCE HE IS ONE MAN AND YOU ARE MANY BUT HER WORDS DIED AWAY
AND HE ABSOLUTELY TREMBLED GO AND CALL JANE SHE CAN FIND ME THE THINGS I WANT AND DO YOU GO TO YOUR IRISH PEOPLE WHO ARE CRYING AND SHOUTING AS IF THEY WERE MAD WITH FRIGHT HE WENT
THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE THE RELIEF OF A WATER BED SHE CEASED MISSUS THORNTON DID NOT REPLY IMMEDIATELY THEN SHE STARTED UP AND EXCLAIMED THEY'RE AT THE GATES CALL JOHN FANNY CALL HIM IN FROM THE MILL THEY'RE AT THE GATES
PERHAPS YOU KNOW MY BROTHER HAS IMPORTED HANDS FROM IRELAND AND IT HAS IRRITATED THE MILTON PEOPLE EXCESSIVELY
IS THERE ANY ONE WHO WILL GO FOR A DOCTOR NOT ME MA'AM IF YOU PLEASE SAID JANE SHRINKING BACK THEM RABBLE MAY BE ALL ABOUT I DON'T THINK THE CUT IS SO DEEP MA'AM AS IT LOOKS
HE CAME OUT LOOKED UP AT THEM THE PALE CLUSTER OF FACES AND SMILED GOOD COURAGE TO THEM BEFORE HE LOCKED THE FACTORY DOOR THEN HE CALLED TO ONE OF THE WOMEN TO COME DOWN AND UNDO HIS OWN DOOR WHICH FANNY HAD FASTENED BEHIND HER IN HER MAD FLIGHT
AS IF SHE FELT HIS LOOK SHE TURNED TO HIM AND ASKED A QUESTION THAT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME IN HER MIND WHERE ARE THE POOR IMPORTED WORK PEOPLE
WHO IS BOUCHER ASKED MISTER THORNTON COOLLY AND COMING CLOSE TO THE WINDOW TO DISCOVER THE MAN IN WHOM MARGARET TOOK SUCH AN INTEREST AS SOON AS THEY SAW MISTER THORNTON THEY SET UP A YELL TO CALL IT NOT HUMAN IS NOTHING
TO MAKE EVEN MARGARET'S OWN FACE AS SHE CAUGHT IT IN THE MIRRORS LOOK GHASTLY AND WAN SHE SAT AND WAITED NO ONE CAME EVERY NOW AND THEN THE WIND SEEMED TO BEAR THE DISTANT MULTITUDINOUS SOUND NEARER
I MUST SAID MARGARET DECIDEDLY THINK OF MAMMA
AS IF TO GAIN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SUDDEN STILLNESS FROM HIM HIS FACE WAS SET INTO RIGID LINES OF CONTEMPTUOUS DEFIANCE NEITHER HOPE NOR FEAR COULD BE READ THERE FANNY RAISED HERSELF UP
STILL WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED HE SHOOK HER OFF
BUT IF NOT YOU WILL BE SAFER THERE THAN HERE GO JANE CONTINUED HE ADDRESSING THE UPPER SERVANT AND SHE WENT FOLLOWED BY THE OTHERS I STOP HERE SAID HIS MOTHER WHERE YOU ARE THERE I STAY
TILL THEIR GREAT BEATS MADE THE STRONG GATES QUIVER LIKE REEDS BEFORE THE WIND THE WOMEN GATHERED ROUND THE WINDOWS FASCINATED TO LOOK ON THE SCENE WHICH TERRIFIED THEM MISSUS THORNTON THE WOMEN SERVANTS
AND THE STUPID WRETCHES HERE WOULDN'T WORK FOR HIM
HE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HER WHILE SHE SPOKE A DARK CLOUD CAME OVER HIS FACE WHILE HE LISTENED HE SET HIS TEETH AS HE HEARD HER WORDS I WILL GO
IT'S MY BELIEF THAT THE BLOW HAS GIVEN HER SUCH AN ASCENDENCY OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD AS SHE'LL NEVER GET THE BETTER FROM SHE LOOKS LIKE A CORPSE NOW
IF YOU HAVE ANY COURAGE OR NOBLE QUALITY IN YOU
KNIT THREE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT FOUR MAKE ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER MAKE ONE KNIT THREE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT FOUR MAKE ONE KNIT THE REST
MAKE ONE KNIT THREE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT FOUR MAKE ONE AND KNIT THE REMAINDER TENTH ROW SEAMED MAKING ONE AT THE BEGINNING ELEVENTH ROW
THEY WERE FREE TO ISSUE FORTH AND BUY GUNPOWDER IN THE FULL EYE OF THE SUN FREE TO FIRE CANNONS AND EXPLODE MINES ON THE LAWN YET THEY NEVER DID ANY ONE OF THESE THINGS NO IRRESISTIBLE ENERGY HALED THEM TO CHURCH O SUNDAYS
TO HER WHO TOOK NO SIDES THERE WAS EVERY BIT AS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR THE HAWK AS FOR THE CHAFFINCH BOTH WERE HER CHILDREN AND SHE WOULD SHOW NO PREFERENCES FURTHER ON A HEDGEHOG LAY DEAD ATHWART THE PATH NAY MORE THAN DEAD DECADENT DISTINCTLY
AS THE GREAT BERGMANN SELDOM PRAISED HIS PUPILS THESE WORDS FILLED NAT'S SOUL WITH PRIDE AND JOY AND HE WORKED YET MORE DILIGENTLY THAN BEFORE TO FULFIL HIS MASTER'S PROPHECY HE THOUGHT THE TRIP TO ENGLAND HAPPINESS ENOUGH BUT FOUND ROOM FOR MORE WHEN EARLY IN JUNE
SEAMED MAKING A STITCH AT THE BEGINNING THIRD ROW MAKE ONE KNIT ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT TWO MAKE ONE KNIT THREE MAKE ONE KNIT TWO
AND IT WAS WITH A CERTAIN SURPRISE THAT I FOUND MYSELF REGARDING THESE FATUOUS ONES WITH KINDLINESS INSTEAD OF CONTEMPT AS I RAMBLED BY UNHEEDED OF THEM THERE WAS INDEED SOME RECONCILING INFLUENCE ABROAD WHICH COULD BRING THE LIKE ANTICS INTO HARMONY WITH BUD AND GROWTH AND THE FROLIC AIR
AND THE OLD FREE LIFE WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE FROM THE TEMPTATIONS THAT BESET HIM IN CITIES BY AND BY WHEN I'M ALL RIGHT AGAIN AND HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL THAT I'M NOT ASHAMED OF I'LL GO HOME HE SAID WITH A QUICKER BEAT OF THE IMPETUOUS HEART THAT LONGED TO BE THERE SO INTENSELY
NOTHING COULD COMFORT HER NAN DOSED IN VAIN DAISY'S CHEERFUL WORDS WENT BY LIKE THE WIND AND BESS'S DEVICES TO AMUSE HER ALL FAILED UTTERLY TO CRY IN MOTHER'S ARMS AND TALK ABOUT THE WRECK WHICH HAUNTED HER EVEN IN HER SLEEP WAS ALL SHE CARED TO DO
I TRUST HE IS A BISHOP BY THIS TIME HE HAD ALL THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS AS WE KNEW THESE STRANGE FOLK HAD VISITORS SOMETIMES STIFF AND COLOURLESS OLYMPIANS LIKE THEMSELVES EQUALLY WITHOUT VITAL INTERESTS AND INTELLIGENT PURSUITS
KNIT THREE MAKE ONE KNIT ONE MAKE ONE KNIT THREE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT REMAINDER TWELFTH ROW SEAMED MAKE ONE AT THE BEGINNING
HE BEAT THE UNICORN OBSERVED HAROLD DUBIOUSLY ALL ROUND THE TOWN THAT PROVES HE WAS A GOOD LION CRIED EDWARDS TRIUMPHANTLY BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU TO TELL EM WHEN YOU SEE EM I SHOULD ASK MARTHA SAID HAROLD OF THE SIMPLE CREED
ALWAYS STUCK STAUNCHLY TO A NEW FAD TILL HE HAD WORN IT QUITE OUT JUST AT PRESENT HE WAS A MUFFIN MAN
OR ADMIT THEMSELVES IN THE WRONG OR TO ACCEPT SIMILAR CONCESSIONS ON OUR PART FOR INSTANCE WHEN I FLUNG THE CAT OUT OF AN UPPER WINDOW THOUGH I DID IT FROM NO ILL FEELING AND IT DIDN'T HURT THE CAT
WHEN HE THOUGHT OF IT DAN FELT AS IF HE COULD NOT WAIT BUT MUST BURST THAT NARROW CELL AND FLY AWAY AS THE CADDIS WORMS HE USED TO WATCH BY THE BROOKSIDE SHED THEIR STONY COFFINS TO CLIMB THE FERNS AND SOAR INTO THE SKY NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE LULLED HIMSELF TO SLEEP WITH PLANNING HOW
KNIT ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT THREE SIXTH ROW SEAMED MAKING ONE AT THE BEGINNING SEVENTH ROW MAKE ONE KNIT THREE KNIT TWO TOGETHER
HE NEITHER LAUGHED NOR SNEERED AS THE OLYMPIANS WOULD HAVE DONE BUT POSSESSED OF A SERIOUS IDIOSYNCRASY HE WOULD CONTRIBUTE SUCH LOTS OF VALUABLE SUGGESTION
KNIT TWO TOGETHER TWICE
AND I'LL RUN ON TO THAT CORNER AND BE A LION
WE HAD JUST LEFT IT OUTSIDE AND WERE ALL ON FIRE TO GET BACK TO IT OF COURSE WE DIDN'T WASTE THE REVELATION ON THEM THE FUTILITY OF IMPARTING OUR IDEAS HAD LONG BEEN DEMONSTRATED ONE IN THOUGHT AND PURPOSE LINKED BY THE NECESSITY OF COMBATING ONE HOSTILE FATE
KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT ONE MAKE ONE KNIT FIVE MAKE ONE KNIT ONE
NO I WON'T I SWEAR I WON'T PROTESTED EDWARD I'LL BE QUITE A NEW LION THIS TIME SOMETHING YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE AND HE RACED OFF TO HIS POST CHARLOTTE HESITATED THEN SHE WENT TIMIDLY ON
HOW RELIEVED WHEN HAVING HONESTLY CONFESSED HIS SHORTCOMINGS THEY ONLY LAUGHED AND OWNED THAT THEY ALSO HAD KNOWN LIKE EXPERIENCES AND WERE THE WISER FOR THEM HE WAS TO GO TO THE WEDDING LATE IN JUNE AND JOIN HIS COMRADES IN LONDON
KNIT TWO TOGETHER TWICE
KNIT THOSE LEFT AT THE END SIXTEENTH ROW SEAMED MAKE ONE AT THE BEGINNING SEVENTEENTH ROW MAKE ONE KNIT THREE KNIT TWO TOGETHER MAKE ONE
HAD I BEEN AN INFANT STERNE HERE WAS A GRAND CHANCE FOR SENTIMENTAL OUTPUT AS THINGS WERE I COULD ONLY HURRY HOMEWARDS MY MORAL TAIL WELL BETWEEN MY LEGS WITH AN UNEASY FEELING AS I GLANCED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER THAT THERE WAS MORE IN THIS CHANCE THAN MET THE EYE
IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AWAKENINGS OF THE YEAR THE EARTH STRETCHED HERSELF SMILING IN HER SLEEP AND EVERYTHING LEAPT AND PULSED TO THE STIR OF THE GIANT'S MOVEMENT WITH US IT WAS A WHOLE HOLIDAY THE OCCASION A BIRTHDAY IT MATTERS NOT WHOSE
AND LET US BEAR IT TOGETHER EMIL'S SHIP IS LOST AND AS YET NO NEWS OF HIM IT WAS WELL MISTER BHAER HAD TAKEN HIS WIFE INTO HIS STRONG ARMS FOR SHE LOOKED READY TO DROP BUT BORE UP AFTER A MOMENT
SILENTLY SUBMITTING AS WAS OUR WONT WITH MORE CONTEMPT THAN ANGER ANON WITH UNCTUOUS HAIR AND FACES STIFFENED IN A CONVENTIONAL GRIN
BUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT ON THIS DAY OF DAYS EVEN A GRIZZLY FELT MISPLACED AND COMMON SURE ENOUGH AN UNDENIABLE BEAR SPRANG OUT ON US AS WE DROPPED INTO THE ROAD THEN ENSUED SHRIEKS GROWLINGS REVOLVER SHOTS AND UNRECORDED HEROISMS
I SEEMED TO DISCERN FAINTLY A SOMETHING OF THE STERN MEANING IN HER VALOROUS CHANT MY INVISIBLE COMPANION WAS SINGING ALSO AND SEEMED AT TIMES TO BE CHUCKLING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF DOUBTLESS AT THOUGHT OF THE STRANGE NEW LESSONS HE WAS TEACHING ME
HAD THEY ALL BEEN TRUE THE ELDERS BORE IT QUIETLY HAVING LEARNED SUBMISSION IN LIFE'S HARD SCHOOL BUT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE REBELLED SOME HOPED AGAINST HOPE AND KEPT UP OTHERS DESPAIRED AT ONCE AND LITTLE JOSIE EMIL'S PET COUSIN AND PLAYMATE WAS SO BROKEN HEARTED
INTO THE VACANT MEADOW SPACES
SOME ONE OF US HAD HAD PRESENTS AND PRETTY CONVENTIONAL SPEECHES AND HAD GLOWED WITH THAT SENSE OF HEROISM WHICH IS NO LESS SWEET THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO DESERVE IT BUT THE HOLIDAY WAS FOR ALL THE RAPTURE OF AWAKENING NATURE FOR ALL
AND PRESENTLY I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE VILLAGE CHURCH SITTING SOLITARY WITHIN ITS CIRCLE OF ELMS FROM FORTH THE VESTRY WINDOW PROJECTED TWO SMALL LEGS GYRATING HUNGRY FOR FOOTHOLD WITH LARCENY
AND FROST PINCHED THE TOES THAT PATIENTLY TRUDGED IN OLD BOOTS NO DEBTS BURDENED HIM THE YEAR OF ABSENCE WAS NEARLY OVER AND IF HE CHOSE TO STAY HERR BERGMANN HAD HOPES FOR HIM THAT WOULD BRING INDEPENDENCE FOR A TIME AT LEAST
KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT TWO FOURTH ROW SEAMED MAKING ONE AT THE BEGINNING FIFTH ROW MAKE ONE KNIT TWO KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT ONE MAKE ONE
THOUGH EMIL WHO WAS TO ACCOMPANY THEM WOULD BE THE GREATER HERO LITTLE DID THE DEAR SOULS DREAM WHAT A SURPRISE WAS IN STORE FOR THEM AS THEY INNOCENTLY LAID THEIR PLANS AND WISHED ALL THE BOYS COULD BE THERE TO WELCOME HOME THEIR ELDEST AND THEIR CASABLANCA
SILENT FACE TO FACE O'ER A DISCREET UNWINKING STILE AS A RULE THIS SORT OF THING STRUCK ME AS THE MOST PITIFUL TOMFOOLERY TWO CALVES RUBBING NOSES THROUGH A GATE WERE NATURAL AND RIGHT AND WITHIN THE ORDER OF THINGS BUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS
ONLY YOU MUSTN'T SAY I TOLD YOU COS IT'S TO BE A SURPRISE ALL RIGHT I SAID MAGNANIMOUSLY
AS BEST MAN HE COULD NOT REFUSE THE NEW SUIT FRANZ INSISTED ON ORDERING FOR HIM AND A CHEQUE FROM HOME ABOUT THAT TIME MADE HIM FEEL LIKE A MILLIONAIRE AND A HAPPY ONE FOR THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH KIND LETTERS FULL OF DELIGHT IN HIS SUCCESS
AND WHISKED HER OVER THE SNOWY ROADS AT A PACE WHICH SET THE BLOOD DANCING IN HER VEINS AND SENT HER HOME STRENGTHENED AND COMFORTED BY SUNSHINE FRESH AIR AND CONGENIAL SOCIETY THREE AIDS YOUNG SUFFERERS SELDOM CAN RESIST
I RAN SIDEWAYS SHOUTING I DUG GLAD HEELS INTO THE SQUELCHING SOIL I SPLASHED DIAMOND SHOWERS FROM PUDDLES WITH A STICK I HURLED CLODS SKYWARDS AT RANDOM AND PRESENTLY I SOMEHOW FOUND MYSELF SINGING
MAKE ONE KNIT TWO TOGETHER KNIT THREE MAKE ONE KNIT ONE MAKE ONE KNIT THREE
AND CHEERED HIM UP WHEN HEIMWEH AND WEARINESS MADE HIM SAD AS SPRING CAME ON THINGS MENDED EXPENSES GREW LESS WORK PLEASANTER AND LIFE MORE BEARABLE THAN WHEN WINTRY STORMS BEAT ON HIS THINLY CLAD BACK
CHAPTER FIFTEEN WAITING
A PLACE ELF HAUNTED WONDERFUL SIMPLY PRODUCED SO MANY APPLES AND CHERRIES OR IT DIDN'T WHEN THE FAILURES OF NATURE WERE NOT INFREQUENTLY ASCRIBED TO US
HE HAD FOUND THE LITTLE GUIDE BOOK THAT CHRISTIAN CARRIED IN HIS BOSOM AND LOVE PENITENCE AND PRAYER THE THREE SWEET SISTERS HAD GIVEN HIM THE ARMOUR WHICH WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE HE HAD NOT LEARNED TO WEAR IT YET AND CHAFED AGAINST IT THOUGH HE FELT ITS VALUE
THANKS TO THE FAITHFUL FRIEND WHO HAD STOOD BY HIM ALL THAT BITTER YEAR SOON HE WAS TO BE FREE AGAIN WORN AND SCARRED IN THE FRAY
HOW PROUD HE WAS TO TELL HIS PLANS ASSURE THEM THAT HE HAD NO DEBTS AND RECEIVE THEIR PRAISES FOR HIS IMPROVEMENT IN MUSIC THEIR RESPECT FOR HIS ECONOMY AND STEADFASTNESS IN WELL DOING
SOME REGRET FOR FAULTS THAT LIE HEAVY ON THE CONSCIENCE WHEN THE ONE SINNED AGAINST IS GONE AND ALL OF THEM THE SOLEMN LESSON TO BE READY WHEN THE SUMMONS COMES A HUSH LAY OVER PLUMFIELD FOR WEEKS AND THE STUDIOUS FACES ON THE HILL REFLECTED THE SADNESS OF THOSE IN THE VALLEY
SO WE SHEERED OFF TOGETHER ARM IN ARM SO TO SPEAK AND WITH FULLEST CONFIDENCE I TOOK THE JIGGING THWARTWISE COURSE MY CHAINLESS PILOT LAID FOR ME A WHIMSICAL COMRADE I FOUND HIM ERE HE HAD DONE WITH ME
FOR THE BOY WAS DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THIS SUDDEN ECLIPSE OF THE FIREFLY WHOSE LIGHT AND LIFE ALL MISSED WHEN THEY WERE GONE AND LURED HER OUT EVERY DAY FOR LONG DRIVES BEHIND THE BLACK MARE WHO SHOOK HER SILVERY BELLS TILL THEY MADE SUCH MERRY MUSIC JOSIE COULD NOT HELP LISTENING TO IT
BUT THE PASSION AND THE CALL OF THE DIVINE MORNING WERE HIGH IN MY BLOOD EARTH TO EARTH THAT WAS THE FRANK NOTE THE JOYOUS SUMMONS OF THE DAY AND THEY COULD NOT BUT JAR AND SEEM ARTIFICIAL THESE HUMAN DISCUSSIONS AND PRETENCES
AND SITTING BY HER GOOD MAN HEARD ALL THAT THERE WAS TO TELL TIDINGS HAD BEEN SENT TO THE SHIPOWNERS AT HAMBURG BY SOME OF THE SURVIVORS AND TELEGRAPHED AT ONCE BY FRANZ TO HIS UNCLE AS ONE BOAT LOAD WAS SAFE
AND BE LIKE THE SELF SACRIFICING HEROINES SHE LOVED TO ACT
THE MASTERFUL WIND WAS UP AND OUT SHOUTING AND CHASING THE LORD OF THE MORNING POPLARS SWAYED AND TOSSED WITH A ROARING SWISH DEAD LEAVES SPRANG ALOFT AND WHIRLED INTO SPACE AND ALL THE CLEAR SWEPT HEAVEN SEEMED TO THRILL WITH SOUND LIKE A GREAT HARP
A SADDENING DOUBT A DULL SUSPICION CREEPS OVER ME ET IN ARCADIA EGO
THOUGH THE WHOLE PLACE SWARMED WITH SUCH PORTENTS THEY CARED NOT ABOUT EXPLORING FOR ROBBERS CAVES NOR DIGGING FOR HIDDEN TREASURE PERHAPS INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THEIR BEST QUALITIES THAT THEY SPENT THE GREATER PART OF THEIR TIME STUFFILY INDOORS
RECOGNISED AND ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT A FLICKER OF DISSENT ALL THE TIME THE HEARTY WIND WAS CALLING TO ME COMPANIONABLY FROM WHERE HE SWUNG AND BELLOWED IN THE TREE TOPS
BY THE BACK DOOR HE HAD RENDERED UP HIS DUCKWEED BEDABBLED PERSON INTO THE HANDS OF AN AUNT AND HAD BEEN PROMPTLY SENT OFF TO BED AND THIS ON A HOLIDAY WAS VERY MUCH
UNDER THE DELUSION THAT THESE PALE PHANTASMS OF REALITY WERE AMONG THE IMPORTANCES OF LIFE WE ILLUMINATI EATING SILENTLY OUR HEADS FULL OF PLANS AND CONSPIRACIES COULD HAVE TOLD THEM WHAT REAL LIFE WAS
I CAN LEAD YOU THE BEST AND RAREST DANCE OF ANY FOR I AM THE STRONG CAPRICIOUS ONE THE LORD OF MISRULE AND I ALONE AM IRRESPONSIBLE AND UNPRINCIPLED AND OBEY NO LAW AND FOR ME I WAS READY ENOUGH TO FALL IN WITH THE FELLOW'S HUMOUR WAS NOT THIS A WHOLE HOLIDAY
FOR ANY OF THOSE FOUR OAKS AT THE CORNERS OF OUR COTTAGE WOULD TEAR HIM TO PIECES THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS BUT HE STANDS THERE AND MAKES AWFUL FACES AT US SOMETIMES AND STRETCHES OUT HIS LONG ARMS AND FINGERS AND TRIES TO KILL US WITH FRIGHT
HERE IT CHANCED THAT UPON THEIR QUEST SIR GALAHAD AND SIR PERCIVALE RENCOUNTERED IN THE DEPTHS OF A GREAT FOREST NOW SIR GALAHAD WAS DIGHT ALL IN HARNESS OF SILVER CLEAR AND SHINING THE WHICH IS A DELIGHT TO LOOK UPON
NEVER YOU MIND I DON'T CHOOSE YOU TO HAVE THEM THEY ARE MY PROPERTY ALL FOR THE GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY SAID ONE AND RAN OFF WITH A GREAT HOLLOW LEAF BUT THE ROSE FAIRY SPRANG AFTER HIM WHAT A BEAUTY SHE WAS ONLY TOO LIKE A DRAWING ROOM YOUNG LADY
SAID THE WOMAN BUT WHAT OF THE ASH TREE SAID I RETURNING ONCE MORE TO THE SUBJECT HERE HOWEVER THE YOUNG WOMAN WHOM I HAD MET IN THE MORNING ENTERED A SMILE PASSED BETWEEN THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
AND THEN THE LATTER BEGAN TO HELP HER MOTHER IN LITTLE HOUSEHOLD DUTIES I SHOULD LIKE TO STAY HERE TILL THE EVENING I SAID AND THEN GO ON MY JOURNEY IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME YOU ARE WELCOME TO DO AS YOU PLEASE ONLY IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO STAY ALL NIGHT THAN RISK THE DANGERS OF THE WOOD THEN
SHE REPLIED BESIDES THE LOOK OF THE TREES THE DOG THERE IS UNHAPPY AND THE EYES AND EARS OF THE WHITE RABBIT ARE REDDER THAN USUAL AND HE FRISKS ABOUT AS IF HE EXPECTED SOME FUN IF THE CAT WERE AT HOME SHE WOULD HAVE HER BACK UP
SHE ROSE AND LOOKED OUT OF THE LITTLE WINDOW MY EYES FOLLOWED HER BUT AS THE WINDOW WAS TOO SMALL TO ALLOW ANYTHING TO BE SEEN FROM WHERE I WAS SITTING I ROSE AND LOOKED OVER HER SHOULDER I HAD JUST TIME TO SEE ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE ON THE EDGE OF THE DENSER FOREST
NE COULD HE BY ANY ART FURBISH IT AGAIN SO THAT AS THE SUN IN HIS GOING DOWN SHONE TWIXT THE BARE TRUNKS OF THE TREES FULL UPON THE KNIGHTS TWAIN THE ONE DID SEEM ALL SHINING WITH LIGHT AND THE OTHER ALL TO GLOW WITH RUDDY FIRE
BUT WE SHALL SOON SEE WHETHER YOU CAN DISCERN THE FAIRIES IN MY LITTLE GARDEN AND THAT WILL BE SOME GUIDE TO US ARE THE TREES FAIRIES TOO AS WELL AS THE FLOWERS I ASKED THEY ARE OF THE SAME RACE SHE REPLIED
BESIDES I WAS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN YEARS OLD LAST MIDSUMMER EVE AND A MAN MUST NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER YOU KNOW BUT YOU ARE NOT MY GRANDMOTHER SAID I HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE RETORTED
AS I CAME NEAR SHE LOOKED UP AND SEEING ME SHOWED NO SURPRISE BUT BENT HER HEAD AGAIN OVER HER WORK AND SAID IN A LOW TONE DID YOU SEE MY DAUGHTER I BELIEVE I DID SAID I CAN YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT FOR I AM VERY HUNGRY
FOR YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW SOON SOMETHING MAY HAPPEN TO OBLIGE US TO BE IN THE FOREST AFTER NIGHTFALL BUT YOU ARE IN THE FOREST SAID I HOW IS IT THAT YOU ARE SAFE HERE HE DARES NOT COME NEARER THAN HE IS NOW SHE REPLIED
WHOSE DEEPEST FOLDS WERE GATHERED AROUND THE DARK OAK CABINET WHICH I NOW APPROACHED WITH A STRANGE MINGLING OF REVERENCE AND CURIOSITY PERHAPS LIKE A GEOLOGIST I WAS ABOUT TO TURN UP TO THE LIGHT SOME OF THE BURIED STRATA
AND DRAWN TOWARDS HER BY AN ATTRACTION IRRESISTIBLE AS INCOMPREHENSIBLE I SUPPOSE I STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS TOWARDS HER FOR SHE DREW BACK A STEP OR TWO AND SAID FOOLISH BOY IF YOU COULD TOUCH ME I SHOULD HURT YOU
YET YOU WOULD SEE A STRANGE RESEMBLANCE ALMOST ONENESS BETWEEN THE FLOWER AND THE FAIRY
THE KEYS OF AN OLD SECRETARY IN WHICH MY FATHER HAD KEPT HIS PRIVATE PAPERS HAD BEEN DELIVERED UP TO ME AS SOON AS I WAS LEFT ALONE I ORDERED LIGHTS IN THE CHAMBER WHERE THE SECRETARY STOOD THE FIRST LIGHTS THAT HAD BEEN THERE FOR MANY A YEAR
HE WANDERED ABOUT ALONE AND LOOKED AT EVERYTHING WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS LITTLE POCKETS AND A WHITE NIGHT CAP ON THE DARLING
AT THE SAME TIME I BEING A MAN AND A CHILD OF THE DAY FELT SOME ANXIETY AS TO HOW I SHOULD FARE AMONG THE ELVES AND OTHER CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT WHO WAKE WHEN MORTALS DREAM AND FIND THEIR COMMON LIFE
FOR THE ASH IS WATCHING US HAVING SAID THIS SHE ROSE AND LED THE WAY INTO THE COTTAGE WHICH I NOW SAW WAS BUILT OF THE STEMS OF SMALL TREES SET CLOSELY TOGETHER AND WAS FURNISHED WITH ROUGH CHAIRS AND TABLES FROM WHICH EVEN THE BARK HAD NOT BEEN REMOVED
WHETHER ALL THE FLOWERS HAVE FAIRIES I CANNOT DETERMINE ANY MORE THAN I CAN BE SURE WHETHER ALL MEN AND WOMEN HAVE SOULS THE WOMAN AND I CONTINUED THE CONVERSATION FOR A FEW MINUTES LONGER
I CANNOT HELP WISHING HOWEVER THAT MY READERS COULD SEE THEM FOR THEMSELVES
WHAT IS SNOW NEVER TRIED DO NOT KNOW WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT HER LITTLE PRIMROSE THERE CANNOT DO WITHOUT HER OH SO SWEETLY FAIR NEVER FEAR SHE WILL COME PRIMROSE DEAR IS SHE DUMB
LOOK SHE DROPS HER HEAD SHE DESERVED IT ROCKET AND SHE WAS NEARLY DEAD TO YOUR HAMMOCK OFF WITH YOU AND SWING ALONE NO ONE WILL LAUGH WITH YOU NO NOT ONE NOW LET US MOAN
FROM THE CUPS OR BELLS OF TALL FLOWERS AS FROM BALCONIES SOME LOOKED DOWN ON THE MASSES BELOW NOW BURSTING WITH LAUGHTER NOW GRAVE AS OWLS BUT EVEN IN THEIR DEEPEST SOLEMNITY SEEMING ONLY TO BE WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEXT LAUGH
I THINK I SEE IT WHAT DO YOU SEE OH NEVER MIND I MAY BE MISTAKEN IN THAT BUT HOW THEN DO YOU COME TO LIVE HERE BECAUSE I TOO HAVE FAIRY BLOOD IN ME HERE I IN MY TURN LOOKED HARD AT HER AND THOUGHT I COULD PERCEIVE
A FAINT STREAK OF PEACH COLOUR DIVIDING A CLOUD THAT JUST ROSE ABOVE THE LOW SWELL OF THE HORIZON ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF THE SUN AS MY THOUGHTS WHICH A DEEP AND APPARENTLY DREAMLESS SLEEP HAD DISSOLVED BEGAN AGAIN
THEY FILLED ME WITH AN UNKNOWN LONGING I REMEMBERED SOMEHOW THAT MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS A BABY I LOOKED DEEPER AND DEEPER TILL THEY SPREAD AROUND ME LIKE SEAS AND I SANK IN THEIR WATERS I FORGOT ALL THE REST TILL I FOUND MYSELF AT THE WINDOW
A ROBE PLAITED IN A BAND AROUND THE NECK AND CONFINED BY A BELT ABOUT THE WAIST DESCENDED TO HER FEET IT WAS ONLY AFTERWARDS HOWEVER THAT I TOOK NOTICE OF HER DRESS ALTHOUGH MY SURPRISE WAS BY NO MEANS OF SO OVERPOWERING A DEGREE
BUT ALL BESPRENT WITH FAIR LILYS OF SILVER SHEEN WHEREAS SIR PERCIVALE BESTRODE A RED HORSE WITH A TAWNY MANE AND TAIL WHOSE TRAPPINGS WERE ALL TO SMIRCHED WITH MUD AND MIRE AND HIS ARMOUR WAS WONDROUS ROSTY TO BEHOLD
I PRESSED THIS REPEATEDLY AND HARD WITH THE POINT OF AN OLD TOOL THAT WAS LYING NEAR TILL AT LENGTH IT YIELDED INWARDS AND THE LITTLE SLIDE FLYING UP SUDDENLY DISCLOSED A CHAMBER EMPTY
SOMETIMES THEY DISAPPEAR ALTOGETHER EVEN FROM ME THOUGH I KNOW THEY ARE NEAR THEY SEEM TO DIE ALWAYS WITH THE FLOWERS THEY RESEMBLE AND BY WHOSE NAMES THEY ARE CALLED BUT WHETHER THEY RETURN TO LIFE WITH THE FRESH FLOWERS OR WHETHER IT BE NEW FLOWERS NEW FAIRIES I CANNOT TELL
JUST AS YOU COULD FORM SOME IDEA OF THE NATURE OF A MAN FROM THE KIND OF HOUSE HE BUILT IF HE FOLLOWED HIS OWN TASTE SO YOU COULD WITHOUT SEEING THE FAIRIES TELL WHAT ANY ONE OF THEM IS LIKE BY LOOKING AT THE FLOWER TILL YOU FEEL THAT YOU UNDERSTAND IT FOR JUST WHAT THE FLOWER SAYS TO YOU
I SHOULD BE ILL SHE CONTINUED IF I DID NOT LIVE ON THE BORDERS OF THE FAIRIES COUNTRY AND NOW AND THEN EAT OF THEIR FOOD AND I SEE BY YOUR EYES THAT YOU ARE NOT QUITE FREE OF THE SAME NEED
THAT THE ASH HAD JUST GONE AWAY IN A SOUTH WESTERLY DIRECTION AND AS MY COURSE SEEMED TO LIE EASTWARD SHE HOPED I SHOULD BE IN NO DANGER OF MEETING HIM IF I DEPARTED AT ONCE I LOOKED OUT OF THE LITTLE WINDOW AND THERE STOOD THE ASH TREE TO MY EYES THE SAME AS BEFORE
AND VERY LITTLE OF MANNERS NOW AND THEN HOWEVER THEY ARE COMPELLED TO ENVY THE GRACE AND SIMPLICITY OF THE NATURAL FLOWERS DO THEY LIVE IN THE FLOWERS I SAID I CANNOT TELL SHE REPLIED
AND FOR AN HOUR PAST HAD BEEN FEELING THE WANT OF FOOD SO I GREW AFRAID LEST I SHOULD FIND NOTHING TO MEET MY HUMAN NECESSITIES IN THIS STRANGE PLACE BUT ONCE MORE I COMFORTED MYSELF WITH HOPE AND WENT ON
SHE WAS WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE SAID AS SHE CLOSED THE BOOK IS THERE A FAIRY COUNTRY BROTHER YOU REPLIED WITH A SIGH I SUPPOSE THERE IS IF ONE COULD FIND THE WAY INTO IT
AS SUCH AN APPARITION MIGHT NATURALLY BE EXPECTED TO EXCITE SEEING HOWEVER AS I SUPPOSE SOME ASTONISHMENT IN MY COUNTENANCE SHE CAME FORWARD WITHIN A YARD OF ME AND SAID IN A VOICE THAT STRANGELY RECALLED A SENSATION OF TWILIGHT
HOORAY AND OFF THEY SET AFTER SOME NEW MISCHIEF BUT I WILL NOT LINGER TO ENLARGE ON THE AMUSING DISPLAY OF THESE FROLICSOME CREATURES THEIR MANNERS AND HABITS ARE NOW SO WELL KNOWN TO THE WORLD HAVING BEEN SO OFTEN DESCRIBED BY EYEWITNESSES
SO THAT IT WAS MUCH WIDER ACROSS THE FINGERS THAN ACROSS THE UNDIVIDED PART OF THE HAND PASSED SLOWLY OVER THE LITTLE BLIND AND THEN AS SLOWLY RETURNED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION HE IS ALMOST AWAKE MOTHER AND GREEDIER THAN USUAL TO NIGHT
SHE'LL COME BY AND BY YOU WILL NEVER SEE HER SHE WENT HOME TO DIES TILL THE NEW YEAR SNOWDROP TIS NO GOOD TO INVITE HER PRIMROSE IS VERY RUDE I WILL BITE HER OH YOU NAUGHTY POCKET
IN THE MIDST OF THE INTERVENING TWILIGHT HOWEVER BEFORE I ENTERED WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE DARKEST PORTION OF THE FOREST I SAW A COUNTRY MAIDEN COMING TOWARDS ME FROM ITS VERY DEPTHS SHE DID NOT SEEM TO OBSERVE ME FOR SHE WAS APPARENTLY INTENT UPON A BUNCH OF WILD FLOWERS
THAT IS ALWAYS THE WAY WITH YOU MEN YOU BELIEVE NOTHING THE FIRST TIME AND IT IS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO LET MERE REPETITION CONVINCE YOU OF WHAT YOU CONSIDER IN ITSELF UNBELIEVABLE I AM NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH YOU HOWEVER BUT TO GRANT YOU A WISH
NOT A LIVING CREATURE CROSSED MY WAY YET SOMEHOW THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT SEEMED ONLY ASLEEP AND TO WEAR EVEN IN SLEEP AN AIR OF EXPECTATION THE TREES SEEMED ALL TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION OF CONSCIOUS MYSTERY AS IF THEY SAID TO THEMSELVES
ACCORDINGLY I SAT DOWN AND FEELING RATHER TIRED AND DISINCLINED FOR FURTHER TALK I ASKED LEAVE TO LOOK AT THE OLD BOOK WHICH STILL SCREENED THE WINDOW THE WOMAN BROUGHT IT TO ME DIRECTLY
MAN DOTH USURP ALL SPACE STARES THEE IN ROCK BUSH RIVER IN THE FACE NEVER THINE EYES BEHOLD A TREE TIS NO SEA THOU SEEST IN THE SEA TIS BUT A DISGUISED HUMANITY
SAYING SHE FEARED THE FAIRIES WOULD BE INTERRUPTED BY FOUL WEATHER FOR A STORM WAS BREWING IN THE WEST AND THE SOONER IT GROWS DARK THE SOONER THE ASH WILL BE AWAKE ADDED SHE I ASKED HER HOW SHE KNEW THAT THERE WAS ANY UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT IN THE WOODS
BUT I BELIEVED THAT THEY KNEW BETTER THAN I DID AND PREPARED TO GO I PULLED OUT MY PURSE BUT TO MY DISMAY THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT THE WOMAN WITH A SMILE BEGGED ME NOT TO TROUBLE MYSELF FOR MONEY WAS NOT OF THE SLIGHTEST USE THERE
UNTIL THE EBBTIDE COMES AND THE WAVES SINK AWAY BACK INTO THE OCEAN OF THE DARK BUT I TOOK COURAGE AND WENT ON SOON HOWEVER I BECAME AGAIN ANXIOUS THOUGH FROM ANOTHER CAUSE I HAD EATEN NOTHING THAT DAY
KNOCKED HIM HEELS OVER HEAD AS HE RAN AND RECOVERED HER GREAT RED LEAF BUT IN THE MEANTIME TWENTY HAD HURRIED OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WITH OTHERS JUST AS GOOD
CLOSED RAPIDLY AS I ADVANCED SO THAT ERE LONG THEIR CROWDED STEMS BARRED THE SUNLIGHT OUT FORMING AS IT WERE A THICK GRATING BETWEEN ME AND THE EAST I SEEMED TO BE ADVANCING TOWARDS A SECOND MIDNIGHT
QUIET PUSSY QUIET BUT WITH A PERFECT HURRICANE OF FELINE CURSES THE POOR ANIMAL BROKE LOOSE AND DASHED ACROSS THE GARDEN AND THROUGH THE HEDGE FASTER THAN EVEN THE FAIRIES COULD FOLLOW NEVER MIND NEVER MIND WE SHALL FIND HER AGAIN
EXCEPT THAT IN ONE CORNER LAY A LITTLE HEAP OF WITHERED ROSE LEAVES WHOSE LONG LIVED SCENT HAD LONG SINCE DEPARTED AND IN ANOTHER A SMALL PACKET OF PAPERS TIED WITH A BIT OF RIBBON
WHILE THEIR BRANCHES MET AND INTERTWINED OVER ITS ROOF HEAPING A GREAT CLOUD OF LEAVES OVER IT UP TOWARDS THE HEAVENS I WONDERED AT FINDING A HUMAN DWELLING IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD AND YET IT DID NOT LOOK ALTOGETHER HUMAN
BUT YOU SPEAK OF INSTRUCTION AND OF A PROFESSION ARE YOU AN ADJUNCT TO THE PROVINCIAL CORPS AS A MASTER OF THE NOBLE SCIENCE OF DEFENSE AND OFFENSE OR PERHAPS
ITS MANUFACTURERS ARE PROSPEROUS AND IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK THAT ONE OF THE MOST INGENIOUS MACHINES KNOWN IN EUROPEAN ART
IT HAS BEEN OFTEN SAID AND IN PUBLISHED STATEMENTS THAT THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK WAS DRAWN AFTER THE SISTER OF THE WRITER WHO WAS KILLED BY A FALL FROM A HORSE NOW NEAR HALF A CENTURY SINCE
FROM CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH AFTER THIS INTRODUCTION WILL BE OBVIOUS TO ALL THE AUTHOR HAS HAD MORE PLEASURE IN WRITING THE PIONEERS THAN THE BOOK WILL PROBABLY EVER GIVE ANY OF ITS READERS
ACCOMPANIED BY MANY DISTINGUISHED MEN VISITED THE SCENE OF THIS TALE IT IS SAID WITH A VIEW TO EXAMINE THE FACILITIES FOR OPENING A COMMUNICATION BY WATER WITH OTHER POINTS OF THE COUNTRY HE STAYED BUT A FEW HOURS
FEW MEN EXHIBIT GREATER DIVERSITY OR IF WE MAY SO EXPRESS IT GREATER ANTITHESIS OF CHARACTER THAN THE NATIVE WARRIOR OF NORTH AMERICA IN WAR HE IS DARING
AND ENTERED UNDER THE HIGH BUT DARK ARCHES OF THE FOREST HERE THEIR PROGRESS WAS LESS INTERRUPTED AND THE INSTANT THE GUIDE PERCEIVED THAT THE FEMALES COULD COMMAND THEIR STEEDS HE MOVED ON AT A PACE BETWEEN A TROT AND A WALK
THUS THE TERM USED IN THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK HAS UNDERGONE THE CHANGES OF MAHICANNI MOHICANS AND MOHEGANS THE LATTER BEING THE WORD COMMONLY USED BY THE WHITES
ALICE HESITATED NO LONGER BUT GIVING HER NARRANGANSETT A SMART CUT OF THE WHIP SHE WAS THE FIRST TO DASH ASIDE THE SLIGHT BRANCHES OF THE BUSHES AND TO FOLLOW THE RUNNER ALONG THE DARK AND TANGLED PATHWAY
SAY RATHER ALICE THAT I WOULD NOT TRUST YOU I DO KNOW HIM OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE MY CONFIDENCE AND LEAST OF ALL AT THIS MOMENT HE IS SAID TO BE A CANADIAN TOO AND YET HE SERVED WITH OUR FRIENDS THE MOHAWKS
RETURNED THE ARCH GIRL FOR NEVER DID I HEAR A MORE UNWORTHY CONJUNCTION OF EXECUTION AND LANGUAGE
THEN YIELDING TO HER GENTLE INFLUENCE HE CLAPPED HIS SPURS
THE AUTHOR REMEMBERS IT A FEW YEARS LATER REDUCED TO THE HUMBLE OFFICE OF A SMOKE HOUSE
AS TO BE CHARACTERISTIC IT IS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT THE ABORIGINES OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT HAVE AN ASIATIC ORIGIN THERE ARE MANY PHYSICAL AS WELL AS MORAL FACTS WHICH CORROBORATE THIS OPINION
WERE IT NOT STILL MORE PAINFUL TO HAVE IT BELIEVED THAT ONE WHOM HE REGARDED WITH A REVERENCE THAT SURPASSED THE LOVE OF A BROTHER WAS CONVERTED BY HIM INTO THE HEROINE OF A WORK OF FICTION
THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE AS TO THE SITE OF THE TALE THE HISTORY OF THIS DISTRICT OF COUNTRY
THE GRAVE OF THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN WAS THE FIRST PLACE OF HUMAN INTERMENT THAT THE AUTHOR EVER BEHELD AS THE SMOKE HOUSE WAS THE FIRST RUIN THE SWIVEL ALLUDED TO IN THIS WORK
HAD HE DRAWN STILL MORE UPON FANCY THE LOVERS OF FICTION WOULD NOT HAVE SO MUCH CAUSE FOR THEIR OBJECTIONS TO HIS WORK STILL THE PICTURE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE LEAST TRUE WITHOUT SOME SUBSTITUTES
IS ORIENTAL CHASTENED AND PERHAPS IMPROVED BY THE LIMITED RANGE OF HIS PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE HE DRAWS HIS METAPHORS FROM THE CLOUDS THE SEASONS THE BIRDS THE BEASTS
THE ROUTE OF THE DETACHMENT IS KNOWN WHILE OURS HAVING BEEN DETERMINED WITHIN THE HOUR MUST STILL BE SECRET SHOULD WE DISTRUST THE MAN BECAUSE HIS MANNERS ARE NOT OUR MANNERS AND THAT HIS SKIN IS DARK COLDLY ASKED CORA
THERE IS SUFFICIENT HISTORICAL TRUTH IN THE PICTURE TO JUSTIFY THE USE THAT HAS BEEN MADE OF IT IN POINT OF FACT THE COUNTRY WHICH IS THE SCENE OF THE FOLLOWING TALE
INTRODUCTION AS THIS WORK PROFESSES IN ITS TITLE PAGE TO BE A DESCRIPTIVE TALE THEY WHO WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO READ IT MAY BE GLAD TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF ITS CONTENTS
THE MOHICANS WERE THE POSSESSORS OF THE COUNTRY FIRST OCCUPIED BY THE EUROPEANS IN THIS PORTION OF THE CONTINENT THEY WERE CONSEQUENTLY THE FIRST DISPOSSESSED
MODEST AND COMMONLY CHASTE THESE ARE QUALITIES IT IS TRUE WHICH DO NOT DISTINGUISH ALL ALIKE BUT THEY ARE SO FAR THE PREDOMINATING TRAITS OF THESE REMARKABLE PEOPLE
SAID THE LADY SHUDDERING PARTLY IN ASSUMED YET MORE IN REAL TERROR YOU KNOW HIM DUNCAN
FOR THE RIFLE AND THE ACTIVITY OF THE SETTLERS HARE DRIVEN THEM TO OTHER HAUNTS TO THIS CHANGE WHICH IN SOME PARTICULARS IS MELANCHOLY TO ONE WHO KNEW THE COUNTRY IN ITS INFANCY IT MAY BE ADDED
TO MAKE THEIR TREATIES AND OTHERWISE TO STRENGTHEN THEIR ALLIANCES AND WHICH REFERS THE NAME TO THIS PRACTICE AS THE INDIAN AGENT OF NEW YORK HAD A LOG DWELLING AT THE FOOT OF THE LAKE HOWEVER
SO INGENIOUS IS CONJECTURE THAT A PERSONAL RESEMBLANCE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED BETWEEN THE FICTITIOUS CHARACTER AND THE DECEASED RELATIVE IT IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE TWO FEMALES
THE LITERAL FACTS ARE CHIEFLY CONNECTED WITH THE NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL OBJECTS AND THE CUSTOMS OF THE INHABITANTS THUS THE ACADEMY AND COURT HOUSE AND JAIL AND INN AND MOST SIMILAR THINGS
THE DELIVERY OF THESE SKILLFUL RHYMES WAS ACCOMPANIED ON THE PART OF THE STRANGER BY A REGULAR RISE AND FALL OF HIS RIGHT HAND WHICH TERMINATED AT THE DESCENT BY SUFFERING THE FINGERS TO DWELL A MOMENT ON THE LEAVES OF THE LITTLE VOLUME
BEFORE THE BRANCHES OF THE BUSHES THAT FORMED THE THICKET WERE CAUTIOUSLY MOVED ASUNDER AND A HUMAN VISAGE
I NEVER ABIDE IN ANY PLACE SLEEPING OR WAKING WITHOUT AN EXAMPLE OF THIS GIFTED WORK TIS THE SIX AND TWENTIETH EDITION PROMULGATED AT BOSTON
HE WILL EVEN CONVEY DIFFERENT SIGNIFICATIONS BY THE SIMPLEST INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE PHILOLOGISTS HAVE SAID THAT THERE ARE BUT TWO OR THREE LANGUAGES PROPERLY SPEAKING
OF THE SAME CLASS IN LIFE WHO WOULD BE LESS ALIKE PERSONALLY THAN ELIZABETH TEMPLE
EXISTED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIS BEAUTIFUL SHEET OF WATER AS EVERY WORD UTTERED BY NATTY BUMPPO WAS NOT TO BE RECEIVED AS RIGID TRUTH WE TOOK THE LIBERTY OF PUTTING THE HORICAN INTO HIS MOUTH
WHICH MAY HAVE A WIDTH OF TWO HUNDRED FEET THIS GORGE WAS DAMMED AND THE WATERS OF THE LAKE COLLECTED THE SUSQUEHANNA WAS CONVERTED INTO A RILL WHEN ALL WAS READY
WHICH MIGHT WITH SOME LITTLE INCONVENIENCE RECEIVE ONE PERSON AT A TIME BECAME VISIBLE HERE THEN LIES OUR WAY SAID THE YOUNG MAN IN A LOW VOICE MANIFEST NO DISTRUST OR YOU MAY INVITE THE DANGER YOU APPEAR TO APPREHEND
WHO MET WITH THE DEPLORABLE FATE MENTIONED IN A WORD
THE PIOUS SELF DENYING LABORIOUS AND ILL PAID MISSIONARY THE HALF EDUCATED LITIGIOUS ENVIOUS AND DISREPUTABLE LAWYER WITH HIS COUNTERPOISE A BROTHER OF THE PROFESSION OF BETTER ORIGIN AND OF BETTER CHARACTER
PROHIBITED A MORE OPEN EXPRESSION OF HIS ADMIRATION OF A WITTICISM THAT WAS PERFECTLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO HIS HEARERS HE CONTINUED IT IS NOT PRUDENT FOR ANY ONE OF MY PROFESSION TO BE TOO FAMILIAR WITH THOSE HE HAS TO INSTRUCT
TOGETHER E E N IN UNITY FOR BRETHREN SO TO DWELL IT'S LIKE THE CHOICE OINTMENT FROM THE HEAD TO THE BEARD DID GO DOWN AARON'S HEAD THAT DOWNWARD WENT HIS GARMENT'S SKIRTS UNTO
IT WAS ERECTED IN AN AGE TOO PRIMITIVE FOR THAT AMBITIOUS SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE BUT THE AUTHOR INDULGED HIS RECOLLECTIONS FREELY WHEN HE HAD FAIRLY ENTERED THE DOOR HERE ALL IS LITERAL
HE IS QUITE AWARE OF ITS NUMEROUS FAULTS SOME OF WHICH HE HAS ENDEAVORED TO REPAIR IN THIS EDITION BUT AS HE HAS IN INTENTION AT LEAST DONE HIS FULL SHARE
AND SEEMINGLY CONVERSED MUCH TOGETHER YET ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT OF THE INTERPRETER EACH WAS ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT OF WHAT THE OTHER SAID
AND EVEN THE DARK THOUGHTFUL EYE OF CORA
WHICH HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED BY THE PASSING THOUGHT MAJOR HEYWARD WAS MISTAKEN ONLY IN SUFFERING HIS YOUTHFUL AND GENEROUS PRIDE TO SUPPRESS HIS ACTIVE WATCHFULNESS THE CAVALCADE HAD NOT LONG PASSED
THE PRIVATE PATH BY WHICH WE ARE TO JOURNEY IS DOUBTLESS AT HAND THE CONJECTURE OF MAJOR HEYWARD WAS TRUE WHEN THEY REACHED THE SPOT WHERE THE INDIAN STOOD POINTING INTO THE THICKET THAT FRINGED THE MILITARY ROAD A NARROW AND BLIND PATH
AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE SETTLEMENT BEGAN AND FROM THAT TIME TO THIS THE COUNTRY HAS CONTINUED TO FLOURISH
MAN'S VOICE IS GIVEN TO HIM LIKE HIS OTHER TALENTS TO BE USED AND NOT TO BE ABUSED
WHO CONTINUED HIS STEADY PACE IN UNDISTURBED GRAVITY THE YOUNG MAN SMILED TO HIMSELF FOR HE BELIEVED HE HAD MISTAKEN SOME SHINING BERRY OF THE WOODS FOR THE GLISTENING EYEBALLS OF A PROWLING SAVAGE AND HE RODE FORWARD CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION
WAS BURIED AND ABANDONED BY THE TROOPS ON THIS OCCASION AND IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND IN DIGGING THE CELLARS OF THE AUTHORS PATERNAL RESIDENCE SOON AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE WAR WASHINGTON
A NARROW THOUGH RAPID STREAM AT ITS SOURCE WAS MUCH FILLED WITH FLOOD WOOD OR FALLEN TREES AND THE TROOPS ADOPTED A NOVEL EXPEDIENT TO FACILITATE THEIR PASSAGE THE OTSEGO
THE AUTHOR HAS ELSEWHERE SAID THAT THE CHARACTER OF LEATHER STOCKING IS A CREATION RENDERED PROBABLE BY SUCH AUXILIARIES AS WERE NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THAT EFFECT
AND SAGES OF THE LAND SURPASS ALL VAIN POETRY HAPPILY
IS LITERAL FACT AND HOW MUCH IS INTENDED TO REPRESENT A GENERAL PICTURE THE AUTHOR IS VERY SENSIBLE THAT HAD HE CONFINED HIMSELF TO THE LATTER
DELAWARES WAPANACHKI AND MOHICANS ALL MEAN THE SAME PEOPLE OR TRIBES OF THE SAME STOCK
AND SEGO OR SAGO THE ORDINARY TERM OF SALUTATION USED BY THE INDIANS OF THIS REGION THERE IS A TRADITION WHICH SAYS THAT THE NEIGHBORING TRIBES WERE ACCUSTOMED TO MEET ON THE BANKS OF THE LAKE
AND ALL HIS FIRST IMPRESSIONS WERE HERE OBTAINED HE HAS INHABITED IT EVER SINCE AT INTERVALS AND HE THINKS HE CAN ANSWER FOR THE FAITHFULNESS OF THE PICTURE HE HAS DRAWN
SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR AND IS ENTITLED THE PSALMS HYMNS AND SPIRITUAL SONGS OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS FAITHFULLY TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH METRE FOR THE USE EDIFICATION AND COMFORT OF THE SAINTS
WHENCE IT CUT A LANE THROUGH THE FOREST TO THE HEAD OF THE OTSEGO THE BOATS AND BAGGAGE WERE CARRIED OVER THIS PORTAGE AND THE TROOPS PROCEEDED TO THE OTHER EXTREMITY OF THE LAKE
OUR CALMER REFLECTION WILL SUGGEST THAT SUCH FORMS AND DELAYS ARE NECESSARY TO GUARD THE PERSON AND PROPERTY OF THE CITIZEN THAT THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE IS THE FIRST ENGINE OF TYRANNY AND THAT THE LAWS OF A FREE PEOPLE
AND YOU WILL PERCEIVE TRUTH LET THAT VILE SAND WHICH YOU TRAMPLE UNDER FOOT BE CAST INTO THE FURNACE LET IT MELT AND SEETHE THERE IT WILL BECOME A SPLENDID CRYSTAL
WITH HONEST OR AFFECTED PREJUDICE
THESE BARE ARMS THESE RAGS THESE IGNORANCES THESE ABJECTNESSES THESE DARKNESSES MAY BE EMPLOYED IN THE CONQUEST OF THE IDEAL GAZE PAST THE PEOPLE
WAS ALLEVIATED BY THE GIFT OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY
SHOULD FORESEE AND DETERMINE EVERY QUESTION THAT MAY PROBABLY ARISE IN THE EXERCISE OF POWER
THE LAWS OF THE PEOPLE THE DECREES OF THE SENATE
WAS CLAMOROUSLY REJECTED PROPERTIUS IN THE ARMS OF DELIA APPLAUDED THE VICTORY OF LICENTIOUS LOVE AND THE PROJECT OF REFORM WAS SUSPENDED TILL A NEW AND MORE TRACTABLE GENERATION HAD ARISEN IN THE WORLD
AND HIS GUILT IS COMMONLY PROVED BY THE TESTIMONY OF A SINGLE FACT BUT OUR RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER ARE VARIOUS AND INFINITE OUR OBLIGATIONS ARE CREATED ANNULLED AND MODIFIED BY INJURIES BENEFITS AND PROMISES
SOME PEOPLE OR OTHER HAD CLOTHED HIM IN RAGS OUT OF CHARITY
IN THE GORBEAU HOVEL WAS THE LAST AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR THE CELL NEXT TO IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A VERY POOR YOUNG MAN WHO WAS CALLED
AND WHICH EXTENDS FROM MISERY TO MISERY INTO THE LOWEST DEPTHS OF SOCIETY DOWN TO THOSE TWO BEINGS IN WHOM ALL THE MATERIAL THINGS OF CIVILIZATION END THE SEWER MAN WHO SWEEPS UP THE MUD AND THE RAGPICKER
THAT IN HIS HANDS ALONE THE ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF LEGISLATION COULD BE SAFELY DEPOSITED
AND THE ABUSE OF FREEDOM ACCELERATED THE PROGRESS OF ANARCHY
WHEN HE ENTERED HE WAS ASKED WHENCE COME YOU HE REPLIED FROM THE STREET WHEN HE WENT AWAY THEY ASKED HIM WHITHER ARE YOU GOING HE REPLIED INTO THE STREETS
BOTH LIVY AND DIONYSIUS ARE WILLING TO BELIEVE THAT THE DEPUTIES OF ROME VISITED ATHENS UNDER THE WISE AND SPLENDID ADMINISTRATION OF PERICLES AND THE LAWS OF SOLON WERE TRANSFUSED INTO THE TWELVE TABLES
THE WISEST OF PRINCES MIGHT BE DECEIVED BY A PARTIAL EXPOSITION OF THE CASE AND THIS ABUSE WHICH PLACED THEIR HASTY DECISIONS ON THE SAME LEVEL WITH MATURE AND DELIBERATE ACTS OF LEGISLATION
THAT THE PATRICIANS SHOULD UNDERTAKE A LONG AND PERILOUS NAVIGATION TO COPY THE PUREST MODEL OF DEMOCRACY IN THE COMPARISON OF THE TABLES OF SOLON WITH THOSE OF THE DECEMVIRS
THAT GALILEO AND NEWTON
THE HISTORIAN MAY CONFESS THAT IN QUESTIONS OF PRIVATE JURISPRUDENCE THE ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGN OF A GREAT EMPIRE CAN SELDOM BE INFLUENCED BY ANY PERSONAL CONSIDERATIONS VIRTUE OR EVEN REASON
AND THE INTERPRETATION OF VOLUNTARY CONTRACTS AND TESTAMENTS WHICH ARE OFTEN DICTATED BY FRAUD OR IGNORANCE AFFORDS A LONG AND LABORIOUS EXERCISE TO THE SAGACITY OF THE JUDGE THE BUSINESS OF LIFE IS MULTIPLIED BY THE EXTENT OF COMMERCE AND DOMINION
BUT IF THE VICTIMS OF TIBERIUS AND NERO ANTICIPATED THE DECREE OF THE PRINCE OR SENATE THEIR COURAGE AND DESPATCH WERE RECOMPENSED BY THE APPLAUSE OF THE PUBLIC THE DECENT HONORS OF BURIAL
AFTER AN IMPOTENT STRUGGLE SUBMITTED TO THE DECREES OF AN ASSEMBLY IN WHICH THEIR VOTES WERE CONFOUNDED WITH THOSE OF THE MEANEST PLEBEIANS YET
FROM WHICH OUR OWN AGE AND COUNTRY ARE NOT PERFECTLY EXEMPT MAY SOMETIMES PROVOKE A GENEROUS INDIGNATION AND EXTORT THE HASTY WISH OF EXCHANGING OUR ELABORATE JURISPRUDENCE
I KNOW NOT WHAT PHILOSOPHER HAS SAID OLD WOMEN ARE NEVER LACKING THIS NEW OLD WOMAN WAS NAMED MADAME BOURGON AND HAD NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT HER LIFE EXCEPT A DYNASTY OF THREE PAROQUETS WHO HAD REIGNED IN SUCCESSION OVER HER SOUL
AND ALL CRIMINALS OF FREE OR SERVILE CONDITION WERE EITHER DROWNED OR BEHEADED OR CAST ALIVE INTO THE AVENGING FLAMES THE ADULTERERS WERE SPARED BY THE COMMON SYMPATHY OF MANKIND
WHY WAS HE CALLED LITTLE GAVROCHE PROBABLY BECAUSE HIS FATHER'S NAME WAS JONDRETTE IT SEEMS TO BE THE INSTINCT OF CERTAIN WRETCHED FAMILIES TO BREAK THE THREAD THE CHAMBER WHICH THE JONDRETTES INHABITED
AND INDUSTRY OF THE CIVILIANS THEY PIOUSLY COMMEMORATE HIS VIRTUES DISSEMBLE OR DENY HIS FAILINGS AND FIERCELY CHASTISE THE GUILT OR FOLLY OF THE REBELS WHO PRESUME TO SULLY THE MAJESTY OF THE PURPLE
AND TO AGGRAVATE THE MISERY OF THE POOR BY THESE DILATORY AND EXPENSIVE PROCEEDINGS THE WEALTHY PLEADER OBTAINS A MORE CERTAIN ADVANTAGE THAN HE COULD HOPE FROM THE ACCIDENTAL CORRUPTION OF HIS JUDGE THE EXPERIENCE OF AN ABUSE
THEN HE QUITTED THE BOULEVARD THE CIRQUE THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN DESCENDED TO THE QUAYS CROSSED THE BRIDGES REACHED THE SUBURBS ARRIVED AT THE SALPETRIERE AND CAME TO A HALT WHERE
AND THE LEGAL ENCOURAGEMENTS OF SUICIDE THE BODIES OF CONDEMNED CRIMINALS WERE EXPOSED TO PUBLIC IGNOMINY AND THEIR CHILDREN A MORE SERIOUS EVIL WERE REDUCED TO POVERTY BY THE CONFISCATION OF THEIR FORTUNES
THE RIGHT OF ACCUSATION WAS CONFINED TO THE MAGISTRATES A VOTE OF THE THIRTY FIVE TRIBES COULD INFLICT A FINE BUT THE COGNIZANCE OF ALL CAPITAL CRIMES WAS RESERVED BY A FUNDAMENTAL LAW TO THE ASSEMBLY OF THE CENTURIES IN WHICH THE WEIGHT OF INFLUENCE AND PROPERTY
IDEA OF THE ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE
HE ANNOUNCED BY THE VOICE OF THE CRIER AND AFTERWARDS INSCRIBED ON A WHITE WALL
AND A GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLE WAR AND RELIGION WERE ADMINISTERED BY THE SUPREME MAGISTRATE AND HE ALONE PROPOSED THE LAWS WHICH WERE DEBATED IN THE SENATE AND FINALLY RATIFIED OR REJECTED BY A MAJORITY OF VOTES
THAT EVERY CITIZEN HAS AN EQUAL RIGHT TO ENACT THE LAWS WHICH HE IS BOUND TO OBEY INSTEAD OF THE CENTURIES THEY CONVENED THE TRIBES
CHAPTER TWELVE THE FUTURE LATENT IN THE PEOPLE AS FOR THE PARISIAN POPULACE EVEN WHEN A MAN GROWN IT IS ALWAYS THE STREET ARAB TO PAINT THE CHILD IS TO PAINT THE CITY
A VOLUNTARY DEATH
HE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW A FATHER AND MOTHER SHOULD BE NEVERTHELESS HIS MOTHER LOVED HIS SISTERS
WITHOUT DISGUISE THE PLENITUDE OF LEGISLATIVE POWER AND THIS INNOVATION SO AGREEABLE TO HIS ACTIVE MIND WAS COUNTENANCED BY THE PATIENCE OF THE TIMES AND HIS LONG ABSENCE FROM THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT
TIME AND SPACE WERE ANNIHILATED BY FANCIFUL SUPPOSITIONS AND THE PLEA OF YOUTH OR FRAUD OR VIOLENCE
WHICH COMPELLED THE PRAETOR OF THE YEAR
SOME CASUAL RESEMBLANCE MAY BE FOUND SOME RULES WHICH NATURE AND REASON HAVE REVEALED TO EVERY SOCIETY
OF THE MISCHIEF OF POPULAR ASSEMBLIES AND THEIR ABOLITION WHICH AUGUSTUS HAD SILENTLY PREPARED WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT RESISTANCE AND ALMOST WITHOUT NOTICE
THOUGH FALSE IN FACT AND SLAVISH IN ITS CONSEQUENCE WAS SUPPORTED ON A PRINCIPLE OF FREEDOM AND JUSTICE
WERE FRAMED BY TWO PRIVATE LAWYERS TO PRESERVE THE CONSTITUTIONS OF THE PAGAN EMPERORS FROM ADRIAN TO CONSTANTINE THE THIRD WHICH IS STILL EXTANT
THE CORNELIAN POMPEIAN AND JULIAN LAWS WERE ADAPTED BY A SINGLE HAND TO THE PREVAILING DISORDERS
THE ORATORS OF ROME AND ATHENS ADDRESS THEIR ARGUMENTS TO THE POLICY AND BENEVOLENCE
HE STRETCHED TO PAST AS WELL AS FUTURE OFFENCES THE OPERATIONS OF HIS EDICTS
ARE ALREADY NUMBERED WITH THE DEAD
STILL CONTINUED A MYSTERIOUS SCIENCE AND A PROFITABLE TRADE AND THE INNATE PERPLEXITY OF THE STUDY WAS INVOLVED IN TENFOLD DARKNESS BY THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY OF THE PRACTITIONERS THE EXPENSE OF THE PURSUIT SOMETIMES EXCEEDED THE VALUE OF THE PRIZE
WHO LIKE HER PREDECESSOR WAS AT THE SAME TIME PORTRESS AND STAIR SWEEPER MOTHER SO AND SO IF ANY ONE SHOULD CHANCE TO COME AND INQUIRE FOR A POLE OR AN ITALIAN OR EVEN A SPANIARD PERCHANCE IT IS I
HE WENT AND CAME SANG PLAYED AT HOPSCOTCH SCRAPED THE GUTTERS STOLE A LITTLE BUT LIKE CATS AND SPARROWS GAYLY LAUGHED WHEN HE WAS CALLED A ROGUE AND GOT ANGRY WHEN CALLED A THIEF HE HAD NO SHELTER NO BREAD
A PAINFUL DEATH WAS INFLICTED BY THE AMPUTATION OF THE SINFUL INSTRUMENT
THE PLEASURE OF THE EMPEROR HAS THE VIGOR AND EFFECT OF LAW SINCE THE ROMAN PEOPLE BY THE ROYAL LAW
DESTROYED THE HARMONY AND SWELLED THE MAGNITUDE OF THE OBSCURE AND IRREGULAR SYSTEM THE LAWS WHICH EXCUSE ON ANY OCCASIONS THE IGNORANCE OF THEIR SUBJECTS CONFESS THEIR OWN IMPERFECTIONS THE CIVIL JURISPRUDENCE
WERE PROCLAIMED AND THE CIVIL JURISPRUDENCE WAS REFORMED BY THE ANNUAL EDICTS OF THE SUPREME JUDGE
THAT THE PARISIAN RACE APPEARS THERE IS THE PURE BLOOD THERE IS THE TRUE PHYSIOGNOMY THERE THIS PEOPLE TOILS AND SUFFERS AND SUFFERING AND TOIL ARE THE TWO FACES OF MAN
WHO COLLECTS SCRAPS THE PRINCIPAL LODGER OF JEAN VALJEAN'S DAY WAS DEAD
WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT IS IT TO ME IF THEY DO GO BAREFOOT THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO READ SO MUCH THE WORSE WOULD YOU ABANDON THEM FOR THAT WOULD YOU TURN THEIR DISTRESS INTO A MALEDICTION CANNOT THE LIGHT PENETRATE THESE MASSES
WAS THE LEGAL SUCCESSOR OF THE LATIN SHEPHERD WHO HAD PLANTED A COLONY ON THE BANKS OF THE TYBER IN A PERIOD OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED YEARS THE LAWS HAD RELUCTANTLY FOLLOWED THE CHANGES OF GOVERNMENT AND MANNERS AND THE LAUDABLE DESIRE OF CONCILIATING ANCIENT NAMES WITH RECENT INSTITUTIONS
AS THE JULIAN LAW AGAINST EXTORTION
SUCH MAXIMS ALONE AS HAD BEEN APPROVED BY REASON AND PRACTICE WERE COPIED BY SUCCEEDING JUDGES THE RULE OF PROCEEDING WAS DEFINED BY THE SOLUTION OF NEW CASES
HE IMPARTED HIS KNOWLEDGE TO THE LEGISLATORS OF ROME
INTERVENED BETWEEN THE ACCUSATION AND THE SENTENCE
AS THE CITIZENS AND THE OFFENDERS CONTINUALLY MULTIPLIED
CHAMBERS TO LET CHANCED TO BE A RARE THING INHABITED BY NUMEROUS INDIVIDUALS WHO HOWEVER AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE IN PARIS HAD NO CONNECTION WITH EACH OTHER
THE LIBRARIES OF GRECIAN PHILOSOPHY HOW ADMIRABLE
THEY ESCAPE BECAUSE OF THEIR SMALLNESS THE TINIEST HOLE SAVES THEM NEVERTHELESS ABANDONED AS THIS CHILD WAS IT SOMETIMES HAPPENED EVERY TWO OR THREE MONTHS THAT HE SAID COME I'LL GO AND SEE MAMMA
AND IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT WE HAVE STUDIED THIS EAGLE
OR TO EXTRAORDINARY INQUISITORS IN THE FIRST AGES THESE QUESTIONS WERE RARE AND OCCASIONAL IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTH CENTURY OF ROME THEY WERE MADE PERPETUAL
BUT THE SAME EMPEROR DECLARED HIMSELF THE IMPLACABLE ENEMY OF UNMANLY LUST AND THE CRUELTY OF HIS PERSECUTION
THE SOLE COIN OF THE INFANT STATE
OR PARISHES OF THE CITY ROMULUS NUMA AND SERVIUS TULLIUS ARE CELEBRATED AS THE MOST ANCIENT LEGISLATORS AND EACH OF THEM CLAIMS HIS PECULIAR PART
THE SAME POLICY WAS EMBRACED BY SUCCEEDING MONARCHS AND ACCORDING TO THE HARSH METAPHOR OF TERTULLIAN
THE PEOPLE OR THE SENATE HAD SOMETIMES GRANTED A PERSONAL EXEMPTION FROM THE OBLIGATION AND PENALTY OF PARTICULAR STATUTES AND EACH INDULGENCE WAS AN ACT OF JURISDICTION EXERCISED BY THE REPUBLIC OVER THE FIRST OF HER CITIZENS HIS HUMBLE PRIVILEGE
BY THE SERVILITY OR PERHAPS THE IGNORANCE OF THE CIVILIANS
THEY INCULCATE THE SOUNDEST PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT AND MORALS AND I AM NOT AFRAID TO AFFIRM
AND THE AUTHORITY OF PARENTS WHICH MAY SEEM TO DRAW THEIR ORIGIN FROM NATURE ITSELF ARE ASCRIBED TO THE UNTUTORED WISDOM OF ROMULUS THE LAW OF NATIONS AND OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP WHICH NUMA INTRODUCED
APPEAR TO HAVE DEPRIVED THE UNFORTUNATE OF THIS LAST CONSOLATION
SING THE MARSEILLAISES SOW ENTHUSIASMS TEAR GREEN BOUGHS FROM THE OAKS MAKE A WHIRLWIND OF THE IDEA THIS CROWD MAY BE RENDERED SUBLIME
OR WITH THE ADVICE OF HIS COUNCIL THE MOST ABSOLUTE POWERS MIGHT BE TRUSTED TO A MAGISTRATE WHO WAS ANNUALLY CHOSEN BY THE VOTES OF THE PEOPLE THE RULES AND PRECAUTIONS OF FREEDOM HAVE REQUIRED SOME EXPLANATION THE ORDER OF DESPOTISM
FOUR PRAETORS WERE ANNUALLY EMPOWERED TO SIT IN JUDGMENT ON THE STATE OFFENCES OF TREASON EXTORTION PECULATION AND BRIBERY AND SYLLA ADDED NEW PRAETORS AND NEW QUESTIONS FOR THOSE CRIMES WHICH MORE DIRECTLY INJURE THE SAFETY OF INDIVIDUALS
WILL SUGGEST TO HIS IMPARTIAL MIND THAT HE IS THE GUARDIAN OF PEACE AND EQUITY AND THAT THE INTEREST OF SOCIETY IS INSEPARABLY CONNECTED WITH HIS OWN UNDER THE WEAKEST AND MOST VICIOUS REIGN
I'VE COME STRANGE TO A NEW COUNTRY MYSELF BUT I NEVER FORGOT HENS ARE A GOOD THING TO HAVE NO MATTER WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE JUST AS YOU SAY MAM SAID JAKE BUT I HATE TO THINK OF KRAJIEK GETTING A LEG OF THAT OLD ROOSTER
EVERY ONE HAS BEEN MOST KIND BUT YOU HAVE COMFORTED ME MOST THOUGH YOU DID NOT MEAN TO I CANNOT THINK HOW YOU DID IT OR UNDERSTOOD SO MUCH I STILL THINK OF YOU AS A LITTLE BOY WITH A LAME LEG I KNOW YOU WILL LET ME SAY THIS
TO WORK WITHOUT CRITICIZING TO THROW HIMSELF VIGOROUSLY INTO THE MACHINE NOT TO MIND IF HE WAS PINCHED NOW AND THEN BY THE ELABORATE WHEELS MISTER ANSELL CRIED HIS WIFE LAUGHING SOMEWHAT SHRILLY AHA NOW I UNDERSTAND
THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE SIMPLY MARVELLOUS WHEN THEY DO THE WHOLE OF LIFE CHANGES AND YOU GET THE TRUE THING BUT DON'T PRETEND YOU'VE GOT IT BEFORE YOU HAVE
AND WE SHALL MEET LATER SIR I DESSY WAS ALL THE GREETING RICKIE GOT FROM HER NOW WHAT KIND OF A LIFE HAS MISSUS ABERDEEN HE EXCLAIMED AS HE AND ANSELL PURSUED THE STATION ROAD HERE THESE BEDDERS COME AND MAKE US COMFORTABLE
WE WENT SLOWLY UP THE ICY PATH TOWARD THE DOOR SUNK IN THE DRAWSIDE BLUE PUFFS OF SMOKE CAME FROM THE STOVEPIPE THAT STUCK OUT THROUGH THE GRASS AND SNOW BUT THE WIND WHISKED THEM ROUGHLY AWAY MISSUS SHIMERDA OPENED THE DOOR BEFORE WE KNOCKED AND SEIZED GRANDMOTHER'S HAND
MANY A MAIDEN LADY WHO HAD READ THAT CAMBRIDGE MEN WERE SAD DOGS WAS SURPRISED AND PERHAPS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED AT THE REASONABLE LIFE WHICH GREETED HER MISS APPLEBLOSSOM IN PARTICULAR HAD HAD A TREMENDOUS SHOCK
AND RICKIE'S HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM THREE YEARS BEFORE WHEN HE HAD SEEN HIS WIFE AND A DEAD MAN CLASPED IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS SHE WAS NEVER TO BE SO REAL TO HIM AGAIN SHE RAN ABOUT THE HOUSE LOOKING HANDSOMER THAN EVER
AGAIN HE WAS ASHAMED WHY WOULD HE SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS HE REBUKED HIS SOUL NOT UNSUCCESSFULLY AND THEN THEY RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT OF VARDEN I'M CERTAIN HE SUFFERS SAID HE FOR SHE WOULD DO NOTHING BUT LAUGH
THEN THE TRAM ARRIVED THE SLOW STUFFY TRAM THAT PLIES EVERY TWENTY MINUTES BETWEEN THE UNKNOWN AND THE MARKETPLACE AND TOOK THEM PAST THE DESECRATED GROUNDS OF DOWNING PAST ADDENBROOKES HOSPITAL GIRT LIKE A VENETIAN PALACE WITH A MANTLING CANAL
THERE WAS LLOYD HE WOULD NOT LEARN THE SCHOOL ANTHEM SAYING THAT IT HURT HIS THROAT AND ABOVE ALL THERE WAS VARDEN WHO TO RICKIE'S BEWILDERMENT WAS NOW A MEMBER OF DUNWOOD HOUSE HE HAD TO GO SOMEWHERE SAID AGNES LUCKY FOR HIS MOTHER THAT WE HAD A VACANCY
SINCE THAT MEETING IN THE SOHO RESTAURANT THERE HAD BEEN SO MUCH TO DO CLOTHES TO BUY PRESENTS TO THANK FOR A BRIEF VISIT TO A TRAINING COLLEGE A HONEYMOON AS BRIEF IN SUCH A BUSTLE WHAT SPIRITUAL UNION COULD TAKE PLACE
EACH BOY WHO PASSES PULLS HIS EARS VERY FUNNY NO DOUBT BUT EVERY DAY THEY STICK OUT MORE AND GET REDDER AND THIS AFTERNOON WHEN HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS BEING WATCHED HE WAS HOLDING HIS HEAD AND MOANING I HATE THE LOOK ABOUT HIS EYES I HATE THE WHOLE BOY
BUT I REFUSE TO ACCOMPANY YOU I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING IS A MOVING WONDER OF SUPREME INTEREST AND TRAGEDY AND BEAUTY WHICH WAS WHAT THE LETTER IN QUESTION AMOUNTED TO
MEANWHILE HE WAS A HUSBAND PERHAPS HIS UNION SHOULD HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZED BEFORE THE CROWN OF LIFE HAD BEEN ATTAINED THE VAGUE YEARNINGS THE MISREAD IMPULSES HAD FOUND ACCOMPLISHMENT AT LAST
THE ATMOSPHERE ALTERS CAMBRIDGE ACCORDING TO HER CUSTOM WELCOMED HER SONS WITH OPEN DRAINS PETTYCURY WAS UP SO WAS TRINITY STREET AND NAVVIES PEEPED OUT OF KING'S PARADE
HITHERTO NO GENTEEL EYE HAD EVEN SEEN INSIDE IT BUT IN THE COLLISION ITS LITTLE CALICO VEIL FELL OFF AND THERE WAS REVEALED NOTHING THE BASKET WAS EMPTY AND NEVER WOULD HOLD ANYTHING ILLEGAL ALL THE SAME SHE WAS DISTRAIT
NOW I DO SO WANT TO FILL IN HER LIFE I SEE ONE HALF OF IT WHAT'S THE OTHER HALF SHE MAY HAVE A REAL JOLLY HOUSE IN GOOD TASTE WITH A LITTLE GARDEN AND BOOKS AND PICTURES OR AGAIN SHE MAYN'T BUT IN ANY CASE ONE OUGHT TO KNOW
THEN QUIETLY AS A SHADOW MISTER SHIMERDA CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE STOVE
AT SIGHT OF IT THE CRAZY BOY BEGAN TO SMACK HIS LIPS WHEN MISSUS SHIMERDA OPENED THE BAG AND STIRRED THE CONTENTS WITH HER HAND IT GAVE OUT A SALTY EARTHY SMELL VERY PUNGENT EVEN AMONG THE OTHER ODORS OF THAT CAVE SHE MEASURED A TEACUP FULL TIED IT UP IN A BIT OF SACKING
SHE IS SO SAD SHE WHISPERED AS SHE WIPED HER WET HANDS ON HER SKIRT AND TOOK THE THINGS GRANDMOTHER HANDED HER THE CRAZY BOY SEEING THE FOOD BEGAN TO MAKE SOFT GURGLING NOISES AND STROKED HIS STOMACH JAKE CAME IN AGAIN THIS TIME WITH A SACK OF POTATOES GRANDMOTHER LOOKED ABOUT IN PERPLEXITY
WE ARE NOT LEAVING SAWSTON SHE WROTE I SAW HOW SELFISH IT WAS OF ME TO RISK SPOILING HERBERT'S CAREER I SHALL GET USED TO ANY PLACE NOW THAT HE IS GONE NOTHING OF THAT SORT CAN MATTER
SHE EVER ROBUST AND PRACTICAL ALWAYS DISCOURAGED HIM SHE WAS NOT COLD SHE WOULD WILLINGLY EMBRACE HIM BUT SHE HATED BEING UPSET AND WOULD LAUGH OR THRUST HIM OFF WHEN HIS VOICE GREW SERIOUS IN THIS SHE REMINDED HIM OF HIS MOTHER
SURELY THE DUST WOULD SETTLE SOON IN ITALY AT EASTER HE MIGHT PERCEIVE THE INFINITIES OF LOVE BUT LOVE HAD SHOWN HIM ITS INFINITIES ALREADY NEITHER BY MARRIAGE NOR BY ANY OTHER DEVICE CAN MEN INSURE THEMSELVES A VISION
OH YES AND YOU'RE ALL WRONG ABOUT PATRIOTISM IT CAN CAN CREATE A SENTIMENT SHE WAS UNUSUALLY PRECISE AND HAD FOLLOWED HIS THOUGHTS WITH AN ATTENTION THAT WAS ALSO UNUSUAL HE WONDERED WHETHER SHE WAS NOT RIGHT AND REGRETTED THAT SHE PROCEEDED TO SAY
HIS LOVE DESIRED NOT OWNERSHIP BUT CONFIDENCE AND TO A LOVE SO PURE IT DOES NOT SEEM TERRIBLE TO COME SECOND HE VALUED EMOTION NOT FOR ITSELF BUT BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY FINAL PATH TO INTIMACY
FOR RICKIE SUFFERED FROM THE PRIMAL CURSE WHICH IS NOT AS THE AUTHORIZED VERSION SUGGESTS THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL BUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL THEN STICK TO THE DUNWOOD HOUSE SET I DO AND SHALL
LAST NIGHT HE SAW HER WITH THE EYES OF BLAKE A VIRGIN WIDOW TALL VEILED CONSECRATED WITH HER HANDS STRETCHED OUT AGAINST AN EVERLASTING WIND WHY SHOULD SHE WRITE HER LETTERS WERE NOT FOR THE LIKES OF HIM NOR TO BE READ IN ROOMS LIKE HIS
OTHER MUSCLES OTHER MINDS ARE PULLING THE ISLAND TO ITS SUBTERRANEAN HOME THROUGH THE ADVANCING WALL OF WATERS HE SEES NO GRISLY FACES NO GHASTLY MEDIEVAL LIMBS BUT BUT WHAT NONSENSE WHEN REAL THINGS ARE SO WONDERFUL WHAT IS THE POINT OF PRETENDING
CAMBRIDGE AND ALL THAT IT MEANT HAD STOOD BEFORE HIM PASSIONATELY CLEAR AND BESIDE IT STOOD HIS MOTHER AND THE SWEET FAMILY LIFE WHICH NURSES UP A BOY UNTIL HE CAN SALUTE HIS EQUALS HE WAS ASHAMED FOR HE REMEMBERED HIS NEW RESOLUTION
AND PRESENTED IT CEREMONIOUSLY TO GRANDMOTHER FOR COOK SHE ANNOUNCED LITTLE NOW BE VERY MUCH WHEN COOK SPREADING OUT HER HANDS AS IF TO INDICATE THAT THE PINT WOULD SWELL TO A GALLON
BUT RICKIE TURNED TO NONE OF THESE FRIENDS FOR JUST THEN HE LOVED HIS ROOMS BETTER THAN ANY PERSON THEY WERE ALL HE REALLY POSSESSED IN THE WORLD THE ONLY PLACE HE COULD CALL HIS OWN
MAREK SLID CAUTIOUSLY TOWARD US AND BEGAN TO EXHIBIT HIS WEBBED FINGERS I KNEW HE WANTED TO MAKE HIS QUEER NOISES FOR ME TO BARK LIKE A DOG OR WHINNY LIKE A HORSE BUT HE DID NOT DARE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS ELDERS
POOH VOLCANIC SAYS THE LEADING TOURIST
NOT BECAUSE A UNIVERSITY IS SMART BUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE MAGIC YEARS AND WITH LUCK YOU SEE UP THERE WHAT YOU COULDN'T SEE BEFORE AND MAYN'T EVER SEE AGAIN AREN'T THESE THE MAGIC YEARS THE LADY DEMANDED HE LAUGHED AND HIT AT HER
WITH A SIGH OF JOY HE ENTERED THE PERISHABLE HOME THAT WAS HIS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL FIRE AND THE KETTLE BOILED AT ONCE HE MADE TEA ON THE HEARTH RUG AND ATE THE BISCUITS WHICH MISSUS ABERDEEN HAD BROUGHT FOR HIM UP FROM ANDERSON'S
HE WISHED GRANDMOTHER TO KNOW HOWEVER THAT HE STILL HAD SOME MONEY IF THEY COULD GET THROUGH UNTIL SPRING CAME THEY WOULD BUY A COW AND CHICKENS AND PLANT A GARDEN AND WOULD THEN DO VERY WELL
GRANDMOTHER LOOKED UP IN ALARM AND SPOKE TO GRANDFATHER JOSIAH YOU DON'T SUPPOSE KRAJIEK WOULD LET THEM POOR CREATURES EAT PRAIRIE DOGS DO YOU
HE HAD IN SOME WAY LOST ON EXCHANGE IN NEW YORK AND THE RAILWAY FARE TO NEBRASKA WAS MORE THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED BY THE TIME THEY PAID KRAJIEK FOR THE LAND AND BOUGHT HIS HORSES AND OXEN AND SOME OLD FARM MACHINERY THEY HAD VERY LITTLE MONEY LEFT
YOU HAD JUST COME FROM SAWSTON AND WERE APPARENTLY CARRIED AWAY BY THE FACT THAT MISS PEMBROKE HAD THE USUAL AMOUNT OF ARMS AND LEGS RICKIE WAS SILENT HE HAD TOLD HIS FRIEND HOW HE FELT BUT NOT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
THEY HAD REACHED THE CORNER OF HILLS ROAD ANSELL SPOKE FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SAID UGH DRAINS YES A SPIRITUAL CESSPOOL RICKIE LAUGHED I EXPECTED IT FROM YOUR LETTER THE ONE YOU NEVER ANSWERED
MISSUS SHIMERDA SNATCHED OFF THE COVERS OF TWO BARRELS BEHIND THE DOOR AND MADE US LOOK INTO THEM IN ONE THERE WERE SOME POTATOES THAT HAD BEEN FROZEN AND WERE ROTTING IN THE OTHER WAS A LITTLE PILE OF FLOUR GRANDMOTHER MURMURED SOMETHING IN EMBARRASSMENT BUT THE BOHEMIAN WOMAN LAUGHED SCORNFULLY
AND THE FAMILIAR MISTAKES IN A BEETHOVEN SONATA THE COLLEGE THOUGH SMALL WAS CIVILIZED AND PROUD OF ITS CIVILIZATION IT WAS NOT SUFFICIENT GLORY TO BE A BLUE THERE NOR AN ADDITIONAL GLORY TO GET DRUNK
TONY LEFT HER CORNER RELUCTANTLY I HAD NEVER SEEN HER CRUSHED LIKE THIS BEFORE
IT WAS FULL OF LITTLE BROWN CHIPS THAT LOOKED LIKE THE SHAVINGS OF SOME ROOT THEY WERE AS LIGHT AS FEATHERS AND THE MOST NOTICEABLE THING ABOUT THEM WAS THEIR PENETRATING EARTHY ODOR WE COULD NOT DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WERE ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE THEY MIGHT BE DRIED MEAT FROM SOME QUEER BEAST JIM
AND THE ACTION TOOK PLACE ON SAINT JOHN'S EVE OFF THE COAST OF SICILY A PARTY OF TOURISTS LAND ON ONE OF THE ISLANDS SUDDENLY THE BOATMEN BECOME UNEASY AND SAY THAT THE ISLAND IS NOT GENERALLY THERE
DID SHE BLESS HIS UNION SO DIFFERENT TO HER OWN DID SHE LOVE HIS WIFE HE TRIED TO SPEAK OF HER TO AGNES BUT AGAIN SHE WAS RELUCTANT AND PERHAPS IT WAS THIS AVERSION TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEAD
A RIFLE CORPS WAS TO BE FORMED SHE HOPED THAT THE BOYS WOULD HAVE PROPER UNIFORMS INSTEAD OF SHOOTING IN THEIR OLD CLOTHES AS MISTER JACKSON HAD SUGGESTED THERE WAS TEWSON COULD NOTHING BE DONE ABOUT HIM HE WOULD SLINK AWAY FROM THE OTHER PREFECTS AND GO WITH BOYS OF HIS OWN AGE
BUT IN THEM WAS ONE CHINK REVEALING ONE STAR AND THROUGH THIS THE SMOKE ESCAPED INTO THE LIGHT OF STARS INNUMERABLE THEN BUT THEN THE VISION FAILED AND THE VOICE OF SCIENCE WHISPERED THAT ALL SMOKE REMAINS ON EARTH IN THE FORM OF SMUTS
FOR WHOSE ADVANTAGE THE SCHOOL HAD BEEN FOUNDED SHE AND MISSUS JACKSON DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT AT THEIR TEA PARTIES AND THE LATTER LADY WAS SURE THAT NO GOOD NO GOOD OF ANY KIND WOULD COME TO DUNWOOD HOUSE FROM SUCH ILL GOTTEN PLUNDER
IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING POOR MISTER ANSELL WOULD SAY WELL I'M BRUTAL I BELIEVE IT DOES VARDEN GOOD TO HAVE HIS EARS PULLED NOW AND THEN AND I DON'T CARE WHETHER THEY PULL THEM IN PLAY OR NOT BOYS OUGHT TO ROUGH IT OR THEY NEVER GROW UP INTO MEN AND YOUR MOTHER WOULD HAVE AGREED WITH ME
AS HE EXPRESSED IT ONE MUST NOT COURT SORROW AND HE HINTED TO THE YOUNG MAN THAT THEY DESIRED TO BE ALONE RICKIE WENT BACK TO THE SILTS HE WAS ONLY THERE A FEW DAYS
FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER MY SLEIGH RIDE WE HEARD NOTHING FROM THE SHIMERDAS MY SORE THROAT KEPT ME INDOORS AND GRANDMOTHER HAD A COLD WHICH MADE THE HOUSEWORK HEAVY FOR HER WHEN SUNDAY CAME SHE WAS GLAD TO HAVE A DAY OF REST
SUSTAINED NO INJURY BUT A SHOCK AND HAD AS HEARTY A LAUGH OVER THE MISHAP AFTERWARDS AS ANY ONE TILLIARD FLED INTO A HANSOM CURSING HIMSELF FOR HAVING TRIED TO DO THE THING CHEAPLY
NASTY WEEDY THING WELL I'M A NASTY WEEDY THING IF IT COMES TO THAT NO YOU AREN'T SHE CRIED KISSING HIM BUT HE LED HER BACK TO THE SUBJECT COULD NOTHING BE SUGGESTED
UNTIL JAKE ARRIVED WITH THE HAMPER AS IF IN DIRECT ANSWER TO MISSUS SHIMERDA'S REPROACHES THEN THE POOR WOMAN BROKE DOWN SHE DROPPED ON THE FLOOR BESIDE HER CRAZY SON HID HER FACE ON HER KNEES AND SAT CRYING BITTERLY
I KNOW SHE'D DISLIKE IT BUT SHE OUGHTN'T TO DISLIKE AFTER ALL BEDDERS ARE TO BLAME FOR THE PRESENT LAMENTABLE STATE OF THINGS JUST AS MUCH AS GENTLEFOLK SHE OUGHT TO WANT ME TO COME SHE OUGHT TO INTRODUCE ME TO HER HUSBAND
BUT AS THE TERM PASSED HE KNEW THAT BEHIND THE YEARNING THERE REMAINED A YEARNING BEHIND THE DRAWN VEIL A VEIL THAT HE COULD NOT DRAW HIS WEDDING HAD BEEN NO MIGHTY LANDMARK HE WOULD OFTEN WONDER WHETHER SUCH AND SUCH A SPEECH OR INCIDENT CAME AFTER IT OR BEFORE
WHEN HE WAS ARMED HE DESCENDS THE STEPS AND FINDS HIS HORSE SADDLED AND THE KING WHO HAD MOUNTED EVERY ONE IN THE CASTLE AND IN THE HOUSES OF THE TOWN HASTENED TO MOUNT IN ALL THE TOWN THERE REMAINED NEITHER MAN NOR WOMAN
NEITHER FARTHER NOR NEARER BUT BROTHER'S CHILDREN AND THERE WAS NEVER NONE OF OUR KIN THAT EVER WAS SHAMED IN BATTLE AND RATHER SUFFER DEATH BROTHER THAN TO BE SHAMED
FOR TO GIVE THE JUDGMENT FOR KING ARTHUR WAS WITH SIR LAUNCELOT AT THE CASTLE JOYOUS GARDE AND SO KING ARTHUR ASSIGNED KING CARADOS AND THE KING OF SCOTS TO BE THERE THAT DAY AS JUDGES
TIME PASSED UNTIL I WAS MADE A KNIGHT KING EVRAIN WHOSE NEPHEW I AM DUBBED ME A KNIGHT IN THE PRESENCE OF MANY HONOURABLE MEN IN THIS VERY GARDEN WHERE WE ARE MY LADY WHO IS SITTING THERE
AND MY MOTHER IS KING MARK'S SISTER AND MY NAME IS SIR TRISTRAM DE LIONES AND KING MARK IS MINE UNCLE TRULY SAID BLEOBERIS I AM RIGHT GLAD OF YOU FOR YE ARE HE THAT
THEREFORE THE JUDGES GAVE HIM RESPITE BY THE THIRD DAY TO GIVE HIS ANSWER SO THE KING DEPARTED UNTO HIS LODGING THE MEANWHILE THERE CAME A LADY BY SIR TRISTRAM'S PAVILION MAKING GREAT DOLE
AND THREW ME DOWN FROM MY PALFREY AND TOOK AWAY THE CHILD FROM ME WELL MY LADY SAID SIR TRISTRAM AND FOR MY LORD SIR LAUNCELOT'S SAKE I SHALL GET YOU THAT CHILD AGAIN OR ELSE I SHALL BE BEATEN FOR IT
AND SO THIS LADY LIKED ME BEST NOTWITHSTANDING SHE IS WEDDED AND HATH A LORD AND I HAVE FULFILLED MY QUEST SHE SHALL BE
THEN I MUST FEEL GREAT GRIEF INDEED FRIEND DOST THOU WISH TO KNOW MY NAME SAYS EREC WELL I SHALL TELL THEE ERE I LEAVE HERE
HOW SIR TRISTRAM FOUGHT FOR SIR ANGUISH AND OVERCAME HIS ADVERSARY AND HOW HIS ADVERSARY WOULD NEVER YIELD HIM
MY GRACIOUS LORD SAID SIR TRISTRAM GRAMERCY OF YOUR GREAT GOODNESSES SHOWED UNTO ME IN YOUR MARCHES AND LANDS
BETWIXT THEM BOTH SHE SAID THESE WORDS UNTO SIR TRISTRAM WIT YE WELL SIR TRISTRAM DE LIONES THAT BUT LATE THOU WAST THE MAN IN THE WORLD THAT I MOST LOVED AND TRUSTED
AND HER GOODNESS THAT KING MARK SAID THAT HE WOULD WED HER WHEREUPON HE PRAYED SIR TRISTRAM TO TAKE HIS WAY INTO IRELAND FOR HIM ON MESSAGE
WITH THEE NEVER WOULD I HAVE GONE AND I SHALL PRAY THIS KNIGHT SO FAIR OF HIS KNIGHTHOOD THAT OR EVER HE PASS THIS COUNTRY THAT HE WILL LEAD ME TO THE ABBEY WHERE MY LORD
THAT ONE WAS SIR ECTOR DE MARIS AND SIR MORGANOR AND THEY TOUCHED THE SHIELD AND BADE HIM COME OUT OF THE PAVILION FOR TO JOUST AN HE WOULD JOUST
BEARS NO SPICE OR ROOT OF USE IN MAKING MEDICINE BUT IT HAD BEEN PLANTED THERE AND WAS TO BE FOUND IN ABUNDANCE THROUGH A NARROW ENTRANCE THE PEOPLE ENTERED KING EVRAIN AND ALL THE REST
BECAUSE THEIR EYES ARE SO BLINDED THAT THEY COMPLETELY LOSE THEIR SIGHT THEY LET THEIR SHIELDS FALL TO THE GROUND AND SEIZE EACH OTHER ANGRILY EACH PULLS AND DRAGS THE OTHER SO THAT THEY FALL UPON THEIR KNEES
SIR AS FOR THAT LET HIM BE HE SHALL NEVER BE REFUSED AN AS HE WERE THE BEST KNIGHT THAT NOW BEARETH SHIELD OR SPEAR
AND GUIVRET WAS GREATLY DELIGHTED TOO THE KING IS GLAD AND SO ARE HIS PEOPLE THERE IS NOT ONE WHO IS NOT WELL SUITED AND PLEASED AT THIS NO ONE CEASES OR LEAVES OFF FROM MAKING MERRY AND FROM SONG EREC COULD BOAST THAT DAY
THEN WHEN THIS WAS DONE KING MARK CAST ALWAYS IN HIS HEART HOW HE MIGHT DESTROY SIR TRISTRAM AND THEN HE IMAGINED IN HIMSELF TO SEND SIR TRISTRAM INTO IRELAND FOR LA BEALE ISOUD
A WHILE HOLD YOUR HANDS AND LET US SPEAK TOGETHER SAY WHAT YE WILL SAID TRISTRAM AND I WILL ANSWER YOU SIR SAID BLEOBERIS
THAT WE CALL ONE OF THE BEST KNIGHTS OF THE WORLD THAT IS TRUTH SAID SIR TRISTRAM SIR LAUNCELOT IS CALLED PEERLESS OF COURTESY AND OF KNIGHTHOOD AND FOR HIS SAKE SAID SIR TRISTRAM I WILL NOT WITH MY GOOD WILL FIGHT NO MORE WITH YOU
AND THEY WERE ARRAYED AFTER THE GUISE THAT WAS THEN USED IN THE GOODLIEST MANNER SO SIR TRISTRAM DEPARTED AND TOOK THE SEA WITH ALL HIS FELLOWSHIP AND ANON AS HE WAS IN THE BROAD SEA
FOR TO WIN IN BATTLE AS ANY THAT I KNOW NOW LIVING SIR SAID SIR TRISTRAM FOR THE GOOD LORDSHIP YE SHOWED ME IN IRELAND AND FOR MY LADY YOUR DAUGHTER'S SAKE
MIGHT WELL SAY THAT NEVER DID LAVINIA OF LAURENTUM WHO WAS SO FAIR AND COMELY POSSESS THE QUARTER OF HER BEAUTY EREC DRAWS NEAR TO HER WISHING TO SEE HER MORE CLOSELY AND THE ONLOOKERS GO
AN EVER IT LAY IN MY POWER AND GENTLE KNIGHT SAID THE KING UNTO SIR TRISTRAM NOW HAVE I GREAT NEED OF YOU NEVER HAD I SO GREAT NEED OF NO KNIGHT'S HELP HOW SO MY GOOD LORD SAID SIR TRISTRAM
FOR RATHER THAN BREAK MY WORD I SHOULD NEVER HAVE PLEDGED IT SINCE I KNEW THE GOOD THERE WAS IN HER I COULD NOR REVEAL OR SHOW TO THE ONE WHOM I HOLD MOST DEAR THAT IN
TRULY I SHOULD NOT FEAR TO FACE ANY MAN ALIVE BUT I AM FOOLISH TO VAUNT MYSELF YET I SAY IT NOT FROM ANY PRIDE BUT BECAUSE I WISH TO COMFORT YOU SO COMFORT YOURSELF AND LET IT BE
SO WHEN KING ANGUISH UNDERSTOOD HIS ACCUSING HE WAS PASSING HEAVY FOR HE KNEW SIR BLAMORE DE GANIS THAT HE WAS A NOBLE KNIGHT AND OF NOBLE KNIGHTS COME THEN THE KING OF IRELAND WAS SIMPLY PURVEYED OF HIS ANSWER
I SHALL TELL YOU SAID THE KING I AM SUMMONED AND APPEALED FROM MY COUNTRY FOR THE DEATH OF A KNIGHT THAT WAS KIN UNTO THE GOOD KNIGHT SIR LAUNCELOT WHEREFORE
FOR SHE IS SO DELIGHTED THAT SHE FORGETS HER SORROW HER HEART LEAPS WITH JOY WHICH SHE CANNOT CONCEAL
AS HE HAD BEEN INASMUCH AS HE DESIRED TO LEAVE THE GARDEN HOWEVER DISAPPOINTING IT MAY BE NO ONE CAN PREVENT HIS GOING AWAY FOR THE HOUR AND THE TIME HAVE COME THEREFORE THE TEARS RAN DOWN HER FACE FROM HER EYES
TO FIND A KNIGHT IN MY STEAD AND WELL I WOT SAID THE KING THESE THAT ARE COME OF KING BAN'S BLOOD AS SIR LAUNCELOT AND THESE OTHER ARE PASSING GOOD KNIGHTS AND HARD MEN
AND THEN FOR DESPITE SIR ECTOR PUT OFF HIS ARMOUR FROM HIM AND WENT ON FOOT AND WOULD NOT RIDE CHAPTER TWENTY HOW KING ANGUISH OF IRELAND
AS I AM TRUE KNIGHT I SHALL HER KNOW PASSINGLY WELL THAT I SHALL LOVE OR TRUST AND SO THEY TOOK THEIR LEAVE ONE FROM THE OTHER AND DEPARTED AND SO SIR TRISTRAM
FOR I HEAR BY THIS LADY'S WORDS SHE BEFORE THIS DAY TRUSTED YOU ABOVE ALL EARTHLY KNIGHTS AND AS SHE SAITH
FOR WHOEVER SHOULD WISH TO CARRY OUT A LITTLE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND THE GATE AND NEVER COULD ISSUE FROM THE GARDEN UNTIL HE HAD RESTORED THE FRUIT TO ITS PLACE
NOR CAN YOU GO ALONG WITH ME FOR AS THE KING HAS ORDERED I MUST NOT TAKE YOU BEYOND THIS POINT THEN HE KISSES HER AND COMMENDS HER TO GOD AND SHE HIM
THAT UP AND DOWN THEY SAID OF HIM ALAS ALAS ILL STARRED WERT THOU FAIR GENTLE SKILFUL KNIGHT SURELY IT WOULD NOT BE JUST THAT THY LIFE SHOULD END SO SOON OR THAT HARM SHOULD COME TO WOUND AND INJURE THEE
SO WHEN THE KINGS WERE AT CAMELOT KING ANGUISH OF IRELAND WAS COME TO KNOW HIS ACCUSERS THEN WAS THERE SIR BLAMORE DE GANIS AND APPEALED THE KING OF IRELAND OF TREASON
THUS LONG THEY FIGHT UNTIL THE HOUR OF NOON IS PAST AND THE BIG KNIGHT IS SO EXHAUSTED THAT HIS BREATH QUITE FAILS HIM EREC HAS HIM AT HIS MERCY AND PULLS AND DRAGS SO THAT HE BREAKS ALL THE LACING OF HIS HELMET
AND TOLD THEM THAT HE HAD FOUND HIS CHAMPION READY THEN BY THE COMMANDMENT OF THE KINGS SIR BLAMORE DE GANIS AND SIR TRISTRAM WERE SENT FOR TO HEAR THE CHARGE AND WHEN THEY WERE COME BEFORE THE JUDGES
BROTHER SAID BLAMORE HAVE YE NO DOUBT OF ME FOR I SHALL NEVER SHAME NONE OF MY BLOOD HOWBEIT I AM SURE THAT YONDER KNIGHT IS CALLED A PASSING GOOD KNIGHT
AND GIVE AGAIN THE CHILD CHAPTER TWENTY ONE HOW SIR TRISTRAM RESCUED A CHILD FROM A KNIGHT AND HOW GOUVERNAIL TOLD HIM OF KING ANGUISH
YOU HAVE BEATEN ME BUT MUCH IT GOES AGAINST MY WILL AND YET YOU MAY BE OF SUCH DEGREE AND FAME THAT ONLY CREDIT WILL REDOUND TO ME AND INSISTENTLY I WOULD REQUEST IF IT MAY BE IN ANY WAY
IT SEEMED THAT SHE HAD SEEN AND KNOWN HER BEFORE BUT NOT BEING VERY CERTAIN OF IT SHE WAS NOT SLOW TO INQUIRE FROM WHENCE SHE WAS OF WHAT COUNTRY AND WHERE HER LORD WAS BORN SHE INQUIRES WHO THEY BOTH ARE
MUCH MORE THAN I CAN SAY WAS SHE GRIEVING AND DISTRESSED NEVERTHELESS SHE SAT UP STRAIGHT BUT SHE DOES NOT CARE SO MUCH FOR ANY OF THOSE WHO TRY TO COMFORT HER THAT SHE CEASES HER MOAN
BUT TO GO HE MADE HIM READY IN THE MOST GOODLIEST WISE THAT MIGHT BE DEVISED FOR SIR TRISTRAM TOOK WITH HIM THE MOST GOODLIEST KNIGHTS THAT HE MIGHT FIND IN THE COURT
I AM THE NIECE OF THE COUNT WHO HOLDS SWAY OVER LALUT THE DAUGHTER OF HIS OWN SISTER AT LALUT I WAS BORN AND BROUGHT UP THE OTHER CANNOT HELP SMILING WITHOUT HEARING MORE
BUT YE SHALL BEAT ME OR EVER YE HAVE THIS LADY THEN DEFEND YOU SAID SIR TRISTRAM
AND THERE SIR TRISTRAM THROUGH GREAT MIGHT SMOTE DOWN SIR BLAMORE AND HIS HORSE TO THE EARTH THEN ANON SIR BLAMORE AVOIDED HIS HORSE AND PULLED OUT HIS SWORD AND THREW HIS SHIELD AFORE HIM AND BADE SIR TRISTRAM ALIGHT
BUT FOR A WHILE THE OTHER COULD NOT REPLY A WORD BEING PREVENTED BY THE SIGHS AND SOBS WHICH TORMENT AND DISTRESS HER SOME TIME IT WAS BEFORE THE DAMSEL RETURNED HER SALUTATION AND WHEN SHE HAD LOOKED AT HER AND EXAMINED HER FOR A WHILE
THAT HE WILL HAVE TO DO HIS UTTERMOST OR OTHERWISE HE CANNOT ESCAPE NAY QUOTH HE SO HELP ME GOD KNOW THAT YOU SHALL HAVE THE BATTLE FOR I DEFY AND CHALLENGE YOU
ALAS SAID SIR ECTOR
FOR NEVER WHEN I WAS A SQUIRE DID I TELL OR MAKE KNOWN MY NAME SIRE YOU KNEW THE TRUTH CONCERNING ALL THAT YOU ASKED ME BUT I MUST STILL TELL YOU THAT THERE IS IN THIS GARDEN A HORN WHICH I DOUBT NOT YOU HAVE SEEN
IF THERE ARE SOME WHO FLEE THERE ARE PLENTY WHO CHASE BUT I DO NOT FEAR YOU SO MUCH THAT I AM GOING TO RUN AWAY YET I AM READY TO MAKE SUCH DEFENCE IF THERE IS ANY WHO WISHES TO OFFER ME BATTLE
BY MY HEAD STAND BACK AND EREC STOPS AND LOOKS AT HIM AND THE OTHER TOO STOOD STILL NEITHER MADE ADVANCE UNTIL EREC HAD REPLIED ALL THAT HE WISHED TO SAY TO HIM
AND SO SIR TRISTRAM TOOK HIS HORSE AND ASKED THE LADY WHICH WAY THE KNIGHT RODE AND THEN SHE TOLD HIM AND HE RODE AFTER HIM AND WITHIN A WHILE HE OVERTOOK THAT KNIGHT AND THEN SIR TRISTRAM BADE HIM TURN
DO YOU KNOW WHY A MAN SOMETIMES THINKS HE HAS WON THE GAME WHO AFTERWARD LOSES IT SO HE IS MANIFESTLY A FOOL WHO IS TOO PRESUMPTUOUS AND WHO THREATENS TOO MUCH
I WILL DO NEITHER SAID BLEOBERIS FOR I DREAD NO CORNISH KNIGHT SO SORE THAT ME LIST TO DELIVER HER WHY SAID SIR TRISTRAM MAY NOT A CORNISH KNIGHT DO AS WELL AS ANOTHER KNIGHT
UPON THE SHIELDS WITH MIGHTY STRENGTH THEY SMOTE EACH OTHER WITH THEIR SHARP WEAPONS SO THAT A FATHOM OF EACH LANCE PASSES THROUGH THE GLEAMING SHIELDS
I CANNOT ISSUE FORTH FROM HERE UNTIL YOU HAVE BLOWN THE HORN BUT THEN YOU WILL HAVE RELEASED ME AND THEN THE JOY WILL BEGIN WHOEVER SHALL HEAR AND GIVE IT HEED NO HINDRANCE WILL DETAIN HIM WHEN HE SHALL HEAR THE SOUND OF THE HORN
THAT WILL AWAY AND RATHER THAN YE SHOULD BE HEARTILY DISPLEASED WITH ME I WOULD YE HAD HER AN SHE WOULD ABIDE WITH YOU NAY SAID THE LADY
SO THEY QUICKLY RISE FOR THEY WERE STRONG AND LITHE THEY STAND ON FOOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN AND STRAIGHTWAY ATTACK EACH OTHER WITH THEIR GREEN SWORDS OF GERMAN STEEL AND DEAL GREAT WICKED BLOWS UPON THEIR BRIGHT
EREC WENT RIDING LANCE IN REST INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN GREATLY DELIGHTING IN THE SONG OF THE BIRDS WHICH WERE SINGING THERE THEY PUT HIM IN MIND OF HIS JOY THE THING HE MOST WAS LONGING FOR
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT HIM FOR ANYTHING
BUT DID NOT TELL ME WHAT IT WAS WHO WOULD DENY HIS MISTRESS AUGHT THERE IS NO LOVER BUT WOULD SURELY DO ALL HIS SWEET HEART'S PLEASURE WITHOUT DEFAULT OR GUILE WHENEVER HE CAN IN ANY WAY
AND FOR TO WIN THE LOVE OF THE KING OF IRELAND I WILL TAKE THE BATTLE UPON ME AND THEREFORE GOUVERNAIL BRING ME I CHARGE THEE TO THE KING
AND THERE GOUVERNAIL TOLD SIR TRISTRAM HOW KING ANGUISH WAS SUMMONED AND APPEALED OF MURDER SO GOD ME HELP SAID SIR TRISTRAM THESE BE THE BEST TIDINGS THAT EVER CAME TO ME THIS SEVEN YEARS
BEFORE EREC CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM HE CRIED OUT VASSAL VASSAL YOU ARE MAD UPON MY LIFE THUS TO APPROACH MY DAMSEL I SHOULD SAY YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO DRAW NEAR HER YOU WILL PAY DEARLY FOR YOUR PRESUMPTION
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN HOW THE LADY FORSOOK SIR TRISTRAM AND ABODE WITH SIR BLEOBERIS AND HOW SHE DESIRED TO GO TO HER HUSBAND SO WHEN SHE WAS SET
BUT WE THE TRUE KNIGHTS ERRANT MEASURE THE WHOLE EARTH WITH OUR OWN FEET EXPOSED TO THE SUN TO THE COLD TO THE AIR TO THE INCLEMENCIES OF HEAVEN BY DAY AND NIGHT ON FOOT AND ON HORSEBACK
AND EVEN IF IT WERE SO I DESIRE YOU TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND COME ALONG FOR THE INSTRUMENTS WE HEARD LAST NIGHT ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO ENLIVEN THE VALLEYS AGAIN AND NO DOUBT THE MARRIAGE WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COOL OF THE MORNING AND NOT IN THE HEAT OF THE AFTERNOON
AND NOT BY SPENDING AS HE PLEASES BUT BY KNOWING HOW TO SPEND IT WELL THE POOR GENTLEMAN HAS NO WAY OF SHOWING THAT HE IS A GENTLEMAN BUT BY VIRTUE BY BEING AFFABLE WELL BRED COURTEOUS GENTLE MANNERED AND KINDLY NOT HAUGHTY ARROGANT OR CENSORIOUS
SAY THAT TO MY WIFE SAID SANCHO WHO HAD UNTIL NOW LISTENED IN SILENCE FOR SHE WON'T HEAR OF ANYTHING BUT EACH ONE MARRYING HIS EQUAL HOLDING WITH THE PROVERB EACH EWE TO HER LIKE
WHO IS CALLED PAR EXCELLENCE
PSALTERIES PIPES
THAT I CAN WELL BELIEVE REPLIED THE BACHELOR FOR THEY ARE SO GOOD AND SO FAT AND SO WELL BRED THAT THEY WOULD NOT SAY ONE THING FOR ANOTHER THOUGH THEY WERE TO BURST FOR IT IN SHORT THEN MISTRESS HOUSEKEEPER THAT IS ALL
OF OVER SIX GALLONS EACH AND ALL FILLED AS IT PROVED AFTERWARDS WITH GENEROUS WINES THERE WERE BESIDES PILES OF THE WHITEST BREAD LIKE THE HEAPS OF CORN ONE SEES ON THE THRESHING FLOORS
IF HE SLEEPS AT ALL IT IS IN THE FIELD ON THE HARD EARTH LIKE A BRUTE BEAST SOMETIMES HE GAZES AT THE SKY
HE HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN TO SMILE OR HEARD TO UTTER RATIONAL WORD AND HE ALWAYS GOES ABOUT MOODY AND DEJECTED TALKING TO HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT SHOWS PLAINLY HE IS OUT OF HIS SENSES HE EATS LITTLE AND SLEEPS LITTLE AND ALL HE EATS IS FRUIT AND WHEN HE SLEEPS
CHAPTER SIX OF WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS NIECE AND HOUSEKEEPER ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTERS IN THE WHOLE HISTORY
ALL THE LINEAGES IN THE WORLD ATTEND TO WHAT I AM SAYING CAN BE REDUCED TO FOUR SORTS WHICH ARE THESE THOSE THAT HAD HUMBLE BEGINNINGS AND WENT ON SPREADING AND EXTENDING THEMSELVES UNTIL THEY ATTAINED SURPASSING GREATNESS THOSE THAT HAD GREAT BEGINNINGS AND MAINTAINED THEM
I CAN TELL YOU NIECE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE IF THESE CHIVALROUS THOUGHTS DID NOT ENGAGE ALL MY FACULTIES THERE WOULD BE NOTHING THAT I COULD NOT DO NOR ANY SORT OF KNICKKNACK THAT WOULD NOT COME FROM MY HANDS PARTICULARLY CAGES AND TOOTH PICKS
SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND CALLED TO HIS SQUIRE SANCHO WHO WAS STILL SNORING
I WOULD INFLICT A CHASTISEMENT UPON THEE FOR THE BLASPHEMY THOU HAST UTTERED THAT ALL THE WORLD SHOULD RING WITH WHAT CAN IT BE THAT A YOUNG HUSSY THAT HARDLY KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE A DOZEN LACE BOBBINS DARES TO WAG HER TONGUE AND CRITICISE THE HISTORIES OF KNIGHTS ERRANT
AT THIS MOMENT THERE CAME A KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
AND SUBMIT TO WHAT I TEACH THEE I WOULD BET SAID SANCHO THAT FROM THE VERY FIRST YOU UNDERSTOOD ME AND KNEW WHAT I MEANT BUT YOU WANTED TO PUT ME OUT THAT YOU MIGHT HEAR ME MAKE ANOTHER COUPLE OF DOZEN BLUNDERS MAY BE SO REPLIED DON QUIXOTE
BUT HE WAS MET BY A TAP ON THE MOUTH FROM THE BUTTON OF THE LICENTIATE'S SWORD THAT CHECKED HIM IN THE MIDST OF HIS FURIOUS ONSET AND MADE HIM KISS IT AS IF IT WERE A RELIC THOUGH NOT AS DEVOUTLY AS RELICS ARE AND OUGHT TO BE KISSED
WHO THE PANZAS FROM WHOM I AM DESCENDED WERE AND WHAT IS MORE I KNOW AND HAVE LEARNED
MADE THEM AN OFFER OF HIS COMPANY AND BEGGED THEM TO SLACKEN THEIR PACE AS THEIR YOUNG ASSES TRAVELLED FASTER THAN HIS HORSE AND THEN TO GRATIFY THEM HE TOLD THEM IN A FEW WORDS WHO HE WAS AND THE CALLING AND PROFESSION HE FOLLOWED
AND ABOVE ALL HANDLES A SWORD AS WELL AS THE BEST
ONE WOULD BE FOR CHOOSING HER FATHER'S SERVANT AND ANOTHER SOME ONE SHE HAS SEEN PASSING IN THE STREET AND FANCIES GALLANT AND DASHING THOUGH HE MAY BE A DRUNKEN BULLY
EVEN WERE IT UNDER GILDED CEILINGS AND SO TURNED ASIDE A LITTLE OUT OF THE ROAD
AND SO SAY I SAID DON QUIXOTE CONTINUE SANCHO MY FRIEND GO ON YOU TALK PEARLS TO DAY THE FACT IS CONTINUED SANCHO
AS THE BRIDEGROOM IS CALLED CAMACHO THE RICH SHE IS EIGHTEEN AND HE TWENTY TWO AND THEY ARE FAIRLY MATCHED THOUGH SOME KNOWING ONES WHO HAVE ALL THE PEDIGREES IN THE WORLD BY HEART WILL HAVE IT THAT THE FAMILY OF THE FAIR QUITERIA IS BETTER THAN CAMACHO'S
AND IF THAT BE SO AS NO DOUBT IT IS
AND HE LIVED IN THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR TO THAT OF HER PARENTS
I KNOW TOO THE INFINITE BLESSINGS THAT ARE ATTAINED BY IT I KNOW THAT THE PATH OF VIRTUE IS VERY NARROW AND THE ROAD OF VICE BROAD AND SPACIOUS I KNOW THEIR ENDS AND GOALS ARE DIFFERENT FOR THE BROAD AND EASY ROAD OF VICE ENDS IN DEATH
AS THE GOOD QUARTERS HE HAD ENJOYED IN THE CASTLE OR HOUSE OF DON DIEGO CAME BACK TO HIS MIND
BUT ABOVE ALL BY BEING CHARITABLE FOR BY TWO MARAVEDIS GIVEN WITH A CHEERFUL HEART TO THE POOR HE WILL SHOW HIMSELF AS GENEROUS AS HE WHO DISTRIBUTES ALMS WITH BELL RINGING AND NO ONE THAT PERCEIVES HIM TO BE ENDOWED WITH THE VIRTUES I HAVE NAMED
LET THIS NEW SAMSON REMAIN IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AND BRINGING HONOUR TO IT BRING HONOUR AT THE SAME TIME ON THE GREY HEADS OF HIS VENERABLE PARENTS FOR I WILL BE CONTENT WITH ANY SQUIRE THAT COMES TO HAND AS SANCHO DOES NOT DEIGN TO ACCOMPANY ME
THE ARCH WAG SAMSON CAME FORWARD AND EMBRACING HIM AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE O FLOWER OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY O SHINING LIGHT OF ARMS O HONOUR AND MIRROR OF THE SPANISH NATION
GET DOWN AND LOOK ABOUT FOR A LADLE AND SKIM OFF A HEN OR TWO AND MUCH GOOD MAY THEY DO YOU I DON'T SEE ONE SAID SANCHO WAIT A BIT SAID THE COOK SINNER THAT I AM HOW PARTICULAR AND BASHFUL YOU ARE
I AM THEREFORE IN A MEASURE CONSTRAINED TO FOLLOW THAT ROAD
NOTHING SENOR SAMSON SAID SHE ONLY THAT MY MASTER IS BREAKING OUT PLAINLY BREAKING OUT WHEREABOUTS IS HE BREAKING OUT SENORA ASKED SAMSON HAS ANY PART OF HIS BODY BURST HE IS ONLY BREAKING OUT AT THE DOOR OF HIS MADNESS SHE REPLIED
HIS ALFORJAS FURNISHED WITH CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE WAY OF VICTUALS AND HIS PURSE WITH MONEY THAT DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIM TO MEET EMERGENCIES SAMSON EMBRACED HIM AND ENTREATED HIM TO LET HIM HEAR OF HIS GOOD OR EVIL FORTUNES SO THAT HE MIGHT REJOICE OVER THE FORMER
SAMSON'S INTENTION IN PERSUADING HIM TO SALLY FORTH ONCE MORE WAS TO DO WHAT THE HISTORY RELATES FARTHER ON
FOR HE WAS THE MOST HUMBLE MINDED AND COURTEOUS KNIGHT OF HIS TIME
POVERTY WEALTH AND BLEAR EYES PEARLS WHAT ART THOU DRIVING AT SANCHO CURSES ON THEE SAID DON QUIXOTE
THE END OF IT WAS THAT THE LICENTIATE RECKONED UP FOR HIM BY THRUSTS EVERY ONE OF THE BUTTONS OF THE SHORT CASSOCK HE WORE TORE THE SKIRTS INTO STRIPS LIKE THE TAILS OF A CUTTLEFISH KNOCKED OFF HIS HAT TWICE AND SO COMPLETELY TIRED HIM OUT
IF ALL THOSE WHO LOVE ONE ANOTHER WERE TO MARRY SAID DON QUIXOTE IT WOULD DEPRIVE PARENTS OF THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND MARRY THEIR CHILDREN TO THE PROPER PERSON AND AT THE PROPER TIME AND IF IT WAS LEFT TO DAUGHTERS TO CHOOSE HUSBANDS AS THEY PLEASED
BUT NO MATTER I UNDERSTAND MYSELF AND I KNOW I HAVE NOT SAID ANYTHING VERY FOOLISH IN WHAT I HAVE SAID ONLY YOUR WORSHIP SENOR IS ALWAYS GRAVELLING AT EVERYTHING I SAY NAY EVERYTHING I DO
FOR I KNOW IT IS THE POSITIVE DETERMINATION OF THE SPHERES THAT SENOR DON QUIXOTE SHALL PROCEED TO PUT INTO EXECUTION HIS NEW AND LOFTY DESIGNS AND I SHOULD LAY A HEAVY BURDEN ON MY CONSCIENCE DID I NOT URGE AND PERSUADE THIS KNIGHT NOT TO KEEP THE MIGHT OF HIS STRONG ARM AND THE VIRTUE OF HIS VALIANT SPIRIT
I KNOW AS OUR GREAT CASTILIAN POET SAYS THAT IT IS BY RUGGED PATHS LIKE THESE THEY GO THAT SCALE THE HEIGHTS OF IMMORTALITY UNREACHED BY THOSE THAT FALTER HERE BELOW
SO THAT THE LOVES OF THE TWO CHILDREN BASILIO AND QUITERIA
WHICH WAS THAT OF A KNIGHT ERRANT SEEKING ADVENTURES IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD HE INFORMED THEM THAT HIS OWN NAME WAS DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA AND THAT HE WAS CALLED BY WAY OF SURNAME THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS ALL THIS WAS GREEK OR GIBBERISH TO THE PEASANTS
THEY SWALLOWED UP WHOLE SHEEP AND HID THEM AWAY IN THEIR INSIDES WITHOUT SHOWING ANY MORE SIGN OF THEM THAN IF THEY WERE PIGEONS
TO INTERFERE WITH THY REPOSE AMBITION BREAKS NOT THY REST NOR DOTH THIS WORLD'S EMPTY POMP DISTURB THEE FOR THE UTMOST REACH OF THY ANXIETY IS TO PROVIDE FOR THY ASS
AND THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN EVER AND NOT CARING TO WAIT FOR THE NOTARY WHO HAD GONE FOR THE SWORD
WHERE YOU ARE NOW TAIL LOOK HERE BACHELOR CORCHUELO RETURNED THE LICENTIATE YOU HAVE THE MOST MISTAKEN IDEA IN THE WORLD ABOUT SKILL WITH THE SWORD IF YOU THINK IT USELESS IT IS NO IDEA ON MY PART BUT AN ESTABLISHED TRUTH
WHY THEN SHOULD NOT HE DO THE SAME WHO HAS TO MAKE THE WHOLE JOURNEY OF LIFE DOWN TO THE FINAL HALTING PLACE OF DEATH MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE COMPANION HAS TO BE HIS COMPANION IN BED AT BOARD AND EVERYWHERE AS THE WIFE IS TO HER HUSBAND
WITH ALL THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUISITE TO MAKE A KNIGHT ERRANT'S SQUIRE BUT HEAVEN FORBID THAT TO GRATIFY MY OWN INCLINATION I SHOULD SHAKE OR SHATTER THIS PILLAR OF LETTERS AND VESSEL OF THE SCIENCES AND CUT DOWN THIS TOWERING PALM OF THE FAIR AND LIBERAL ARTS
AS HE WAS THERE DESCRIBED BUT NOW HEARING HIM TALK OF A WILL AND CODICIL THAT COULD NOT BE PROVOKED INSTEAD OF WILL AND CODICIL THAT COULD NOT BE REVOKED
AND IT WILL BE LABOUR IN VAIN FOR YOU TO URGE ME TO RESIST WHAT HEAVEN WILLS FATE ORDAINS REASON REQUIRES AND ABOVE ALL MY OWN INCLINATION FAVOURS FOR KNOWING AS I DO THE COUNTLESS TOILS THAT ARE THE ACCOMPANIMENTS OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY
IN FINE DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO EMBRACED ONE ANOTHER AND MADE FRIENDS AND BY THE ADVICE AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE GREAT CARRASCO WHO WAS NOW THEIR ORACLE IT WAS ARRANGED THAT THEIR DEPARTURE SHOULD TAKE PLACE THREE DAYS THENCE BY WHICH TIME THEY COULD HAVE
WIELD TRENCHANT BLADES OF DAMASCUS STEEL OR CLUBS STUDDED WITH SPIKES ALSO OF STEEL SUCH AS I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE SEEN
NO HAMMER DRIVES THE HOOPS OF A CASK AS SHE DRIVES ONE TO DO WHAT SHE WANTS BUT AFTER ALL A MAN MUST BE A MAN AND A WOMAN A WOMAN AND AS I AM A MAN ANYHOW WHICH I CAN'T DENY I WILL BE ONE IN MY OWN HOUSE TOO LET WHO WILL TAKE IT AMISS
GOD BLESS ME SAID THE NIECE THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW SO MUCH UNCLE
MAYBE THERE ARE TOLEDANS WHO DO NOT HIT IT OFF WHEN IT COMES TO POLISHED TALK THAT IS TRUE SAID THE LICENTIATE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BRED UP IN THE TANNERIES
THOUGH IT MIGHT BE THAT YOUR GRAVE WOULD BE DUG ON THE SPOT WHERE YOU PLANTED YOUR FOOT THE FIRST TIME I MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BE STRETCHED DEAD THERE FOR DESPISING SKILL WITH THE SWORD
AND THAT THE SAME HE PAID ME OUT OF YOUR ESTATE FOR I DON'T CARE TO STAND ON REWARDS WHICH EITHER COME LATE OR ILL OR NEVER AT ALL GOD HELP ME WITH MY OWN
HE HAS PROVIDED DANCERS TOO NOT ONLY SWORD BUT ALSO BELL DANCERS FOR IN HIS OWN TOWN THERE ARE THOSE WHO RING THE CHANGES AND JINGLE THE BELLS TO PERFECTION OF SHOE DANCERS I SAY NOTHING FOR OF THEM HE HAS ENGAGED A HOST BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS
FOR I KNOW NOT WHAT I AM SO FOCILE MEANS
OF COUNTLESS PRINCES MONARCHS LORDS MEDES ASSYRIANS PERSIANS GREEKS AND BARBARIANS ALL THESE LINEAGES AND LORDSHIPS HAVE ENDED IN A POINT AND COME TO NOTHING
WHO WILL MAKE ME TURN MY BACK AND THAT THERE IS NOT ONE IN THE WORLD I WILL NOT COMPEL TO GIVE GROUND AS TO WHETHER YOU TURN YOUR BACK OR NOT I DO NOT CONCERN MYSELF REPLIED THE MASTER OF FENCE
NOR DO WE ONLY KNOW ENEMIES IN PICTURES BUT IN THEIR OWN REAL SHAPES AND AT ALL RISKS AND ON ALL OCCASIONS WE ATTACK THEM WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO CHILDISH POINTS OR RULES OF SINGLE COMBAT WHETHER ONE HAS OR HAS NOT A SHORTER LANCE OR SWORD
THAT HE MIGHT BE TAKEN FOR A CLOTHED STATUE WITH ITS DRAPERY STIRRED BY THE WIND IN SHORT HE SHOWS SUCH SIGNS OF A HEART CRUSHED BY SUFFERING THAT ALL WE WHO KNOW HIM
IN WHICH IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENAMOURED SHEPHERD TOGETHER WITH OTHER TRULY DROLL INCIDENTS DON QUIXOTE HAD GONE BUT A SHORT DISTANCE BEYOND DON DIEGO'S VILLAGE WHEN HE FELL IN WITH A COUPLE OF EITHER PRIESTS OR STUDENTS AND A COUPLE OF PEASANTS
AND THEREFORE I SHOULD BE SORRY THAT ANY AFFAIRS OF MINE SHOULD WORRY HIM WHEREUPON THE HOUSEKEEPER SAID TELL US SENOR AT HIS MAJESTY'S COURT ARE THERE NO KNIGHTS THERE ARE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE AND PLENTY OF THEM AND IT IS RIGHT THERE SHOULD BE
AND ANY ONE OF THEM OR ANY MOMENT THE HOUSE MAY FALL I HAVE SEEN THE RAIN COMING DOWN AND THE SUN SHINING ALL AT ONE TIME
THAT WITHOUT ENVYING OR BEING ENVIED SLEEPEST
SO THAT TO BRING HIM ROUND AGAIN EVER SO LITTLE COST ME MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED EGGS
BUT IT WAS ALL PREACHING IN THE DESERT AND HAMMERING COLD IRON NEVERTHELESS AMONG MANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO HIM THE HOUSEKEEPER SAID TO HIM IN TRUTH MASTER IF YOU DO NOT KEEP STILL AND STAY QUIET AT HOME
THE SPICES OF DIFFERENT KINDS DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BOUGHT BY THE POUND BUT BY THE QUARTER AND ALL LAY OPEN TO VIEW IN A GREAT CHEST
THE BREAD EATEN AND THE COMPANY DISPERSED
NOR OF THE MANY OTHERS I HAVE OMITTED TO MENTION
THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE AND ANOTHER FOR THE COURTIERS WITHOUT QUITTING THEIR CHAMBERS OR THE THRESHOLD OF THE COURT RANGE THE WORLD OVER BY LOOKING AT A MAP WITHOUT ITS COSTING THEM A FARTHING AND WITHOUT SUFFERING HEAT OR COLD HUNGER OR THIRST
CONTEMPLATED ALL AND EVERYTHING WON HIS HEART THE FIRST TO CAPTIVATE AND TAKE HIS FANCY WERE THE POTS
I'LL MAKE YOU TELL ME SAID THE COWBOY AND HE PUT A FACE ON HIMSELF THAT WAS TERRIBLE TO LOOK AT AND RUNNING THROUGH THE HOUSE LIKE A MADMAN COULD FIND NOTHING THAT WOULD GIVE PAIN ENOUGH TO THE GRUAGACH
JACK HAD THE ROOF BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE FOR HE MADE THE BOY GIVE HIM NEW STRAW SAYS THE MASTER WHEN HE CAME OUT GO JACK AND LOOK FOR THE HEIFERS AND BRING THEM HOME AND WHERE WILL I LOOK FOR EM
AND TOO SMALL FOR TWO
STRUCK THAT BLOW ASKED THE KING OF ERIN IT WAS I SAID THE COWBOY WHAT REASON HAD YOU TO STRIKE THE MAN WHO WON MY DAUGHTER
EASY BOYS SAYS JACK WALK ON YOUR TIPPY TOES TILL WE SEE WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH SO THEY CREPT NEAR THE WINDOW AND THERE THEY SAW SIX ROBBERS INSIDE WITH PISTOLS AND BLUNDERBUSHES
I COULD DEFEND MYSELF BETTER WITH THE IRON THAN THE WOODEN PIKE YELLOW FACE GAVE ME THE IRON PIKE
AT FIRST THE ROBBERS WERE VERY GLAD TO FIND THEMSELVES SAFE IN THE THICK WOOD
HAND ME OUT ONE POUND THIRTEEN AND FOURPENCE IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME TO FINISH MY JOB DIVEL DO YOU GOOD WITH YOUR ONE POUND THIRTEEN AND FOURPENCE
WITH THE SECOND THRUST TO HIS WAIST AND WITH THE THIRD TO HIS SHOULDERS I HAVE YOU AT LAST YOU'RE DONE FOR NOW SAID THE COWBOY THEN HE TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE CUT THE FIVE HEADS OFF THE GIANT
AND HELPLESS AS HIS BROTHER ALL THE POOR MOTHER COULD SAY DIDN'T PREVENT JACK THE FOOL FROM STARTING TO SEE IF HE WAS ABLE TO REGULATE THE GRAY CHURL HE AGREED WITH HIM FOR A YEAR FOR TWENTY POUNDS
THE SHEE AN GANNON TOOK SERVICE AND ATE HIS SUPPER THEN THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE SAID I AM THE GRUAGACH GAIRE NOW THAT YOU ARE MY MAN AND HAVE EATEN YOUR SUPPER YOU'LL HAVE A BED OF SILK TO SLEEP ON
AND ROCKS AND BRIARS TILL THEY GOT DOWN INTO A HOLLOW AND THERE WAS THE LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE SHADOW AND ALONG WITH IT CAME SINGING
WHEN I WAS IN A PASSION IF I WAS SORRY FOR MY BARGAIN I WAS MAD ENOUGH TO SAY I WAS AND HERE I AM DISABLED FOR LIFE VEXED ENOUGH WERE THE POOR MOTHER AND BROTHERS
ON THE SHELTERY SIDE OF A PILE OF DRY PEAT ON DRY GRASS AND NOT BE COMING HERE AND GOING BACK SO YOU MAY AS WELL GIVE ME MY SUPPER
WHILE HE WENT UP AND BROUGHT DOWN THE TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS AND DOUBLE WAGES FOR JACK HIMSELF WHEN HE GOT HOME HE BROUGHT THE SUMMER ALONG WITH HIM TO THE POOR MOTHER AND THE DISABLED BROTHERS
HE MIGHT BE ALIVE NOW THE COWBOY AND THE GRUAGACH STOOD BY THE FIRE A STORK WAS BOILING IN THE POT AS WHEN THE GRUAGACH CAME THE FIRST TIME
SO ALL CAME AGAIN INTO THE OTHER ROOM AND JACK WAS MADE SIT DOWN AND EVERYBODY DRANK HIS HEALTH AND HE DRANK EVERYBODY'S HEALTH AT ONE OFFER AND SIX STOUT FELLOWS SAW HIMSELF AND THE MASTER HOME AND WAITED IN THE PARLOUR
THEY WERE TAKING THE GOOSE OFF THE SPIT BUT WELL BECOMES JACK
GO AND MAKE THE SHEEP'S FEET A GOOD PATH ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE BOG AND WHAT DID HE FIND JACK AT BUT SHARPENING A CARVING KNIFE AND THE SHEEP STANDING OR GRAZING ROUND IS THIS
TO BE SURE YOU LAZY SLUGGARD I DO HAND ME OUT ONE POUND THIRTEEN AND FOURPENCE MASTER YOU SAID IF I ONLY KEPT BROWNEY OUT OF MISCHIEF THE REST WOULD DO NO HARM THERE SHE IS
A HILL AT A LEAP AND TRAVELLED ALL DAY TILL EVENING THEN HE CAME TO A HOUSE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE ASKED HIM WHAT SORT WAS HE AND HE SAID A YOUNG MAN LOOKING FOR HIRE
I'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY AFTER YOUR NAP NEXT MORNING EARLY JACK ASKED HOW HE'D BE EMPLOYED THAT DAY YOU ARE TO BE HOLDING THE PLOUGH IN THAT FALLOW OUTSIDE THE PADDOCK THE MASTER WENT OVER ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK
WHEN THE HARE RAN IN AND BEFORE THEY COULD STOP HIM HE WAS OUT AGAIN BUT THE COWBOY MADE AFTER THE HARE AND THE GRUAGACH AFTER THE COWBOY AND THEY RAN AS FAST AS EVER THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM TILL NIGHTFALL
THE DOG AND CAT LAY IN THE ASS'S WARM LAP AND THE COCK WENT TO ROOST IN THE NEXT TREE WELL THE SOUNDNESS OF DEEP SLEEP WAS OVER THEM ALL WHEN THE COCK TOOK A NOTION OF CROWING BOTHER YOU BLACK COCK SAYS THE ASS
I AM SATISFIED SAID THE MASTER AGAIN THE FIRST DAY THAT JACK SERVED HE WAS FED VERY POORLY AND WAS WORKED TO THE SADDLESKIRTS NEXT DAY HE CAME IN JUST BEFORE THE DINNER WAS SENT UP TO THE PARLOUR
THEY BLEW OUT THE CANDLES THREW DOWN THE TABLE AND SKELPED OUT AT THE BACK DOOR AS IF THEY WERE IN EARNEST AND NEVER DREW REIN TILL THEY WERE IN THE VERY HEART OF THE WOOD JACK AND HIS PARTY GOT INTO THE ROOM
I GOT A PELT FROM A SLEDGE HAMMER THAT SENT ME HALF A MILE OFF IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME I'LL GIVE YOU LEAVE TO GO AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELVES OH MY POOR CAPTAIN SAYS THEY
IF IT WAS THE SERVANT HE SHOULD GET NO WAGES AT ALL BUT THE THIEF SAYS HE GAVE ME SO LITTLE TO EAT AND KEPT ME SO HARD AT WORK THAT FLESH AND BLOOD COULDN'T STAND IT AND WHEN HE ASKED ME ONCE
BUT KEPT HIS MIND TO HIMSELF AND WENT TO THE BED OF SILK TO SLEEP ON THE MORNING THE COWBOY ROSE BEFORE HIS MASTER
AND HIS TEETH THAT WERE EQUAL TO SIXPENNY NAILS AND HIS WINGS ILL LUCK BE IN HIS ROAD WELL AT LAST I REACHED THE STABLE
BUT IF HE DID WE WERE READY FOR HIM MY TWELVE SONS AND MYSELF AS SOON AS HE TOSSED UP THE ASHES AND RAN OFF WE MADE AFTER HIM AND FOLLOWED HIM TILL NIGHTFALL WHEN HE WENT INTO A GLEN WE SAW A LIGHT BEFORE US
WE BELIEVE YOU TO THE NINES CATCH US INDEED GOING WITHIN A HEN'S RACE OF THAT UNLUCKY CABIN WELL BEFORE THE SUN SHOOK HIS DOUBLET NEXT MORNING JACK AND HIS COMRADES WERE UP AND ABOUT
WHAT COULD I DO WITH THE TWELVE IRON ONES FOR MYSELF OR MY MASTER I'LL TAKE THE WOODEN ONE HE PUT IT ON AND TAKING THE TWELVE IRON LOOPS PUT THEM ON THE NECKS OF THE TWELVE DAUGHTERS OF THE HOUSE
AND I'LL BE SURE TO SEE THAT THEY'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHILE THE MASTER WAS IN GREAT SPIRITS HE FELT SOMETHING CLAMMY HIT HIM ON THE CHEEK IT FELL BESIDE HIS TUMBLER AND WHEN HE LOOKED AT IT WHAT WAS IT BUT THE EYE OF A SHEEP
AH MY LORD DON'T BELIEVE THE RASCAL SURE I DIDN'T OPEN THE DOOR TO THE SIX ROBBERS AND HOW DID YOU KNOW THERE WERE SIX YOU POOR INNOCENT SAID THE LORD NEVER MIND SIR SAYS JACK
SAID HE EVERYTHING MUST HAVE A BEGINNING MASTER SAID JACK AND A THING WELL BEGUN IS HALF DONE
WERE HUNTING A POOR DOG WITH A KETTLE TIED TO HIS TAIL HE RAN UP TO JACK FOR PROTECTION
SHOULD GET AN INCH WIDE OF THE SKIN OF HIS BACK FROM SHOULDER TO HIPS TAKEN OFF IF IT WAS THE MASTER
THE MASTER CAUGHT HIMSELF IN TIME BUT HE WAS SO STOMACHED HE SAID NOTHING
WHAT PUT A STOP TO THE LAUGHING OF THE GRUAGACH THE SHEE AN GANNON MADE NO ANSWER BUT LEFT THE KING AND PUSHED AWAY TO KNOW COULD HE FIND WHY THE GRUAGACH WAS SILENT HE TOOK A GLEN AT A STEP
ALL YOUR GOLD AND SILVER IS THERE IN THAT SACK AND I DON'T THINK YOU WILL BEGRUDGE US OUR SUPPER AND BED AFTER OUR LONG MARCH FROM THE WOOD OF ATHSALACH BEGRUDGE INDEED NOT ONE OF YOU WILL EVER SEE A POOR DAY IF I CAN HELP IT
THERE WAS SUCH A THRONG OF PEOPLE THAT NO ONE COULD GO A STEP AHEAD WE MUST CLEAR A ROAD THROUGH THIS SAID THE COWBOY WE MUST INDEED SAID THE GRUAGACH AND AT IT THEY WENT
WHAT FOR OH I SEE YOU'VE FORGOT YOUR BARGAIN ARE YOU SORRY FOR IT
NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST THE GRUAGACH SAID TO THE SHEE AN GANNON GO OUT NOW AND LOOSEN MY FIVE GOLDEN COWS AND MY BULL WITHOUT HORNS AND DRIVE THEM TO PASTURE BUT WHEN YOU HAVE THEM OUT ON THE GRASS
AND MADE FOR THE ROOM DOOR TO LOOK FOR A CANDLE INSIDE HE TROD ON THE DOG'S TAIL AND IF HE DID HE GOT THE MARKS OF HIS TEETH IN HIS ARMS
JACK AND HIS COMRADES ONCE THERE WAS A POOR WIDOW AS OFTEN THERE HAS BEEN AND SHE HAD ONE SON A VERY SCARCE SUMMER CAME AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY'D LIVE TILL THE NEW POTATOES WOULD BE FIT FOR EATING
WE ATE DRANK PLAYED CARDS AND ENJOYED OURSELVES TILL ONE DAY WHEN MY SONS AND I WERE PLAYING A SLENDER BROWN HARE CAME RUSHING IN JUMPED ON TO THE HEARTH
WOULD YOU TELL A BODY SAYS THE COCK THAT WAS PERCHED ON THE ASS'S HEAD WHO WAS IT THAT OPENED THE DOOR FOR THE ROBBERS THE OTHER NIGHT AH MAYBE THE PORTER'S RED FACE DIDN'T TURN THE COLOUR OF HIS FRILL
SAYS ANOTHER AND ALL THE LORD OF DUNLAVIN'S GOLD AND SILVER THAT WE LEFT BEHIND SAYS THE LAST I THINK I'LL VENTURE BACK SAYS THE CAPTAIN AND SEE IF WE CAN RECOVER ANYTHING THAT'S A GOOD BOY
AND I'M GREATLY IN DREAD THAT YOUR HEAD'LL BE ON THE TWELFTH SPIKE FOR I'LL DO THE SAME TO YOU THAT I DID TO THE ELEVEN KINGS SONS
BUT JACK KEPT HIS SEAT AND NEVER DREW REIN TILL BREAD BUTTER AND MILK WENT DOWN THE RED LANE NOW MISTRESS SAID HE I'LL BE EARLIER AT MY WORK TO MORROW IF I SLEEP COMFORTABLY
TO SEE WHAT KIND OF A PLOUGHMAN WAS JACK AND WHAT DID HE SEE BUT THE LITTLE BOY DRIVING THE BASTES AND THE SOCK AND COULTER OF THE PLOUGH SKIMMING ALONG THE SOD AND JACK PULLING DING DONG AGAIN THE HORSES
AND BLESSED HIM AS FAR AS HER EYES COULD SEE HIM WELL HE WENT ALONG AND ALONG TILL HE WAS TIRED AND NE'ER A FARMER'S HOUSE HE WENT INTO WANTED A BOY AT LAST HIS ROAD LED BY THE SIDE OF A BOG
SO JACK SAID TO HIS MOTHER ONE EVENING MOTHER BAKE MY CAKE AND KILL MY HEN TILL I GO SEEK MY FORTUNE AND IF I MEET IT NEVER FEAR BUT I'LL SOON BE BACK TO SHARE IT WITH YOU SO SHE DID AS HE ASKED HER
AND GAVE A BLOW THAT SENT HIM SPINNING
TO GET MY DINNER NOW AND NOT LOSE TIME COMING HOME FROM THE BOG THAT'S TRUE JACK SAID SHE SO SHE BROUGHT OUT A GOOD CAKE AND A PRINT OF BUTTER AND A BOTTLE OF MILK THINKING HE'D TAKE THEM AWAY TO THE BOG
MAYBE I WON'T REMEMBER YOUR KINDNESS IF EVER I FIND YOU IN HARDSHIP AND WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE YOU ALL GOING WE'RE GOING TO SEEK OUR FORTUNE TILL THE HARVEST COMES IN
AND THE GRUAGACH SAID I LIVED IN THIS CASTLE
THE SON OF THE KING OF TISEAN CAME AND TOOK THE GIANT'S HEADS AND CLAIMED THE PRINCESS IN MARRIAGE WHEN THE GRUAGACH GAIRE SHOULD LAUGH AFTER SUPPER THE COWBOY WOULD GIVE NO TALK TO HIS MASTER
BUT SOME ROPES MADE OF UNTANNED SHEEPSKIN HANGING ON THE WALL HE TOOK THESE DOWN CAUGHT THE GRUAGACH FASTENED HIM BY THE THREE SMALLS AND TIED HIM SO THAT HIS LITTLE TOES WERE WHISPERING TO HIS EARS
MUCH OBLEEGED TO YOU WHERE IS THE BASTE AND YOURSELF GOING WE'RE GOING TO SEEK OUR FORTUNE TILL HARVEST COMES IN
I HAVE EVER TOLD WHY I STOPPED LAUGHING AND THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS EVER SEEN MY FLEECE OF WOOL WHEN THE KING OF ERIN HEARD WHAT THE GRUAGACH SAID AND SAW THE TONGUES OF THE GIANT FITTED IN THE HEAD HE
OFF THEY SET AGAIN AND JUST AS THE SHADOWS OF THE TREES WERE THREE TIMES AS LONG AS THEMSELVES THEY HEARD A GREAT CACKLING IN A FIELD INSIDE THE ROAD AND OUT OVER THE DITCH JUMPED A FOX WITH A FINE BLACK COCK IN HIS MOUTH
WELL SAID THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE I WAS GOING TOMORROW TO LOOK FOR A MAN TO MIND MY COWS IF YOU'LL WORK FOR ME YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD PLACE THE BEST FOOD A MAN COULD HAVE TO EAT IN THIS WORLD AND A SOFT BED TO LIE ON
NOT ONE WAS ABLE TO GET IT AND TELL ME WHAT STOPPED THE GRUAGACH GAIRE FROM LAUGHING I TOOK THE HEADS OFF THEM ALL WHEN THEY CAME BACK WITHOUT THE TIDINGS FOR WHICH THEY WENT
SURE YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T HAVE YOUR CURSE AND DAMER'S ESTATE ALONG WITH IT WELL THEN JACK SAYS SHE HERE'S THE WHOLE LOT OF EM WITH MY THOUSAND BLESSINGS ALONG WITH THEM SO SHE STOOD ON THE YARD FENCE
THIS DAMP GRASS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR WARM ROOM SAYS ONE I WAS OBLIGED TO DROP A FINE PIG'S FOOT SAYS ANOTHER
AND THERE WAS A POOR ASS UP TO HIS SHOULDERS NEAR A BIG BUNCH OF GRASS HE WAS STRIVING TO COME AT
AND OLD TREES BREAKING THE COWBOY LOOKED AROUND AND SAW A FIVE HEADED GIANT PUSHING THROUGH THE TREES AND SOON HE WAS BEFORE HIM
BACK FOREMOST BUT THE ASS RECEIVED HIM WITH A KICK ON THE BROADEST PART OF HIS SMALL CLOTHES AND LAID HIM COMFORTABLY ON THE DUNGHILL WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND BEGAN TO THINK WHAT HAPPENED HIM
TOLD THE MASTER HE CAME UP JACK YOU ANOINTED SCOUNDREL WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO GO TO SLEEP
HAND ME ONE POUND THIRTEEN AND FOUR PENCE BEFORE YOU SIT DOWN TO YOUR DINNER
AND GET RID OF THEM ILL CONDUCTED BOYS PURSHUIN TO EM WELL WELL THROW YOUR TAIL OVER YOUR ARM AND COME ALONG THEY GOT OUTSIDE THE TOWN AND SAT DOWN UNDER AN OLD WALL AND JACK PULLED OUT HIS BREAD AND MEAT
AND FELL AT THE FEET OF THE MASTER OF THE PLACE WHO HAS DARED TO INTERFERE WITH MY FIGHTING PET SCREAMED YELLOW FACE I SAID THE COWBOY AND IF YOUR PET HAD HAD MANNERS
YOU NASTY BRUTE
AND PEEPING INTO THE HOLES HE WAS MAKING WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE YOU RASCAL
AND A GREAT STORK BOILING IN THE POT THE MAN OF THE HOUSE SAID TO ME THERE ARE BUNDLES OF RUSHES AT THE END OF THE ROOM GO THERE AND SIT DOWN WITH YOUR MEN HE WENT INTO THE NEXT ROOM
IN CAME THE MASTER AND BEGAN TO ABUSE HIM FOR HIS ASSURANCE OH YOU KNOW MASTER YOU'RE TO FEED ME AND WHEREVER THE GOOSE GOES WON'T HAVE TO BE FILLED AGAIN TILL SUPPER ARE YOU SORRY FOR OUR AGREEMENT
THEY FOUGHT TILL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE GIANT WAS GETTING THE UPPER HAND AND THEN THE COWBOY THOUGHT THAT IF THE GIANT SHOULD KILL HIM HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD NEVER FIND HIM OR SET EYES ON HIM AGAIN
RODE THE CLOUD CAPPED SUMMIT OF THE DREAD MOUNTAIN WITH THE SHADOWS NOW DARK NOW LIGHT BETRAYING THE MOSSY CAVERNS AND ASHY ROCKS WHICH TESTIFIED THE PAST CONFLAGRATIONS AND MIGHT HAVE PROPHESIED
SHE AGAIN TORE HERSELF FROM HIM
HE SENT OFF A ROYAL COURIER AT ONCE BIDDING HIM BRING BACK AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER
IT MAY REVOLT IT MAY TERRIFY
WAS A COLOSSAL HEAD OF THE BLACKEST MARBLE WHICH SHE PERCEIVED BY THE CROWN OF WHEAT EARS THAT ENCIRCLED THE BROW REPRESENTED THE GREAT EGYPTIAN GODDESS ARBACES STOOD BEFORE THE ALTAR
HE SLID HE FELL
ASCENDED SIMULTANEOUSLY AT THE FEET OF IONE AND AT THE SAME INSTANT FROM BEHIND THE CURTAINS SWELLED THE INVISIBLE AND SOFTEST MUSIC ARBACES PLACED HIMSELF AT THE FEET OF IONE AND CHILDREN
HALF ENOUGH GOOD LOOKS AND WIT TO SUIT HIM HE WAS NOW OF AN AGE WHEN HE AND HIS FATHER THE KING AND THEIR FAITHFUL SUBJECTS WERE ALL OF OPINION THAT HE OUGHT TO GET MARRIED BUT AS WE HAVE SEEN
THE CITY SEEMED AS AFTER THE AWFUL CHANGE OF SEVENTEEN AGES IT SEEMS NOW TO THE TRAVELER A CITY OF THE DEAD THE OCEAN ITSELF THAT SERENE AND TIDELESS SEA
OR GATHERED IN BASKETS LAY LIKE OFFERINGS AT THE FEET OF THE FREQUENT STATUES THAT GLEAMED ALONG THEIR PATH WHITHER WOULDST THOU LEAD ME ARBACES SAID IONE WONDERINGLY
WHY IN THOSE PHLEGRAE NOW LAUGHING WITH THE VINE
AND SLAIN LIKE A DOG BY A TILE FROM THE HAND OF AN OLD WOMAN VERILY THE STARS FLATTER WHEN THEY GIVE ME A TYPE IN THIS FOOL OF WAR WHEN THEY PROMISE TO THE ARDOUR OF MY WISDOM THE SAME RESULTS AS TO THE MADNESS OF HIS AMBITION
BEFORE HIM LAY THE VINEYARDS AND MEADOWS OF THE RICH CAMPANIA THE GATE AND WALLS ANCIENT HALF PELASGIC OF THE CITY SEEMED NOT TO BOUND ITS EXTENT
TIRED BEAST THEN HE WENT INTO THE COTTAGE WHICH CONSISTED OF ONE LITTLE ROOM WHICH WAS BOTH DARK AND LOW HE SAT DOWN ON A WOODEN BENCH AND BEGAN TO TALK TO THE OLD PEOPLE
HE RODE AND RODE STILL HE COULD NOT GET TO THE END OF THE FOREST NOONDAY CAME
THEN THE PRINCE HAD HIS SUPPER THE BEST THE HOUSE COULD AFFORD A CRUST OF DRY BREAD AND A BOWL OF MILK THE OLD FOLK THEN FETCHED A WISP OF STRAW
THE CONVULSION CEASED AS SUDDENLY AS IT CAME THEY TARRIED NO LONGER GLAUCUS BORE IONE LIGHTLY IN HIS ARMS AND THEY FLED FROM THE UNHALLOWED SPOT
HE MIGHT NOT EVEN DREAM OF MAKING HIS WIFE SO HE TURNED RESOLUTELY AWAY
OLD AND FEEBLE AS THEY WERE SHE EARNED A FEW PENCE BY HER SPINNING AND WEAVING
AS HE SCOWLED OVER THE CITIES THE BOAST AND FLOWER OF CAMPANIA YE SLUMBER
BUT HE WAS THOROUGHLY TIRED OUT SO HE SOON FELL ASLEEP
HIS FIRST CARE WAS FOR HIS HORSE STABLE THERE WAS NONE BUT THERE WAS A BIT OF A SHED FOR THE OLD PEOPLE'S COW
HIS ADDRESSES SO HE DETERMINED TO JOURNEY TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND TO TRAVEL INCOGNITO AND UNATTENDED
DARE NOT TELL ME THAT DARE NOT MOCK ME IT IS IMPOSSIBLE WHOM HAST THOU SEEN WHOM KNOWN OH IONE IT IS THY WOMAN'S INVENTION THY WOMAN'S ART THAT SPEAKS
FOR HIM DOOMED TO STRIVE FOR ALL THINGS TO ENJOY NONE ALL ATTACKING NOTHING GAINING BATTLES WITHOUT FRUIT LAURELS WITHOUT TRIUMPH FAME WITHOUT SUCCESS AT LAST MADE CRAVEN BY HIS OWN SUPERSTITIONS
HE RODE STRAIGHT HOME TO HIS FATHER'S CASTLE
AND THE OLD PEOPLE PERSISTED
IT SEEMED LOCKED AS IN DEATH BLOOD GUSHED FROM THE EGYPTIAN'S LIPS OVER HIS GLITTERING ROBES HE FELL HEAVILY FROM THE ARMS OF GLAUCUS AND THE RED STREAM TRICKLED SLOWLY ALONG THE MARBLE AGAIN THE EARTH SHOOK BENEATH THEIR FEET
AS A TITAN ON WHOM THE MOUNTAINS ARE PILED
THINKEST THOU THAT HE HAS WATCHED THE FRUIT RIPEN TO YIELD IT TO ANOTHER PRETTY FOOL NO THOU ART MINE ALL ONLY MINE AND THUS THUS I SEIZE AND CLAIM THEE
IS THE WRITER OF THIS THE MAN THOU LOVEST IONE SOBBED BUT ANSWERED NOT SPEAK HE RATHER SHRIEKED THAN SAID IT IS IT IS
DID THEY LIVE HERE ALL ALONE IN THE WILD WOOD YES THE OLD FOLK SAID THEY DID
MEANWHILE
THEN HE AWOKE AND STIFF ENOUGH HE WAS IN ALL HIS LIMBS FROM LYING ON SO HARD A BED
THINK NOT OF ME AS THOU HAST THOUGHT
HE TRAVELED FAR AND WIDE FROM ONE LAND TO ANOTHER BUT IT FARED WITH HIM ABROAD AS IT HAD FARED WITH HIM AT HOME
SAID ARBACES SINKING HIS VOICE INTO A WHISPER THOU SHALT GO TO THY TOMB RATHER THAN TO HIS ARMS WHAT THINKEST THOU ARBACES WILL BROOK A RIVAL SUCH AS THIS PUNY GREEK WHAT
WHOSE FESTIVE AND GLITTERING GARMENTS CONTRASTED IN MOCKERY THE SOLEMN TERROR OF THE HOUR THEY DID NOT APPEAR TO HEED THE STRANGERS
WHAT BECOMES OF IONE IN THE HOUSE OF ARBACES
SAVE INDEED THAT YET IN YON SEARED AND BLASTED SUMMIT FANCY MIGHT THINK TO READ THE CHARACTERS OF THE OLYMPIAN THUNDERBOLT BUT IT WAS NEITHER THE RUGGED HEIGHT OF THE STILL VOLCANO
AH YES
RISE AND IF THOU ART SERIOUS IF THY LANGUAGE BE IN EARNEST
INTENDING TO LIE UPON IT THEY HAD BUT ONE BED AND THEY MEANT TO GIVE IT UP TO THEIR GRAND GUEST BUT THE PRINCE WOULD NOT HEAR OF SUCH A THING
WAS ALL THE ENERGY LESS OF LOVE THAN OF REVENGE
MY SOUL WHISPERS HOPE IT SWEEPS EXULTINGLY BEYOND THE BODING HOUR
AND THEY FOLLOWED HIM TILL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT AND NOT ONLY DID THEY FOLLOW HIM THUS FAR BUT LONG AFTER HE HAD LEFT BOTH HOUSE AND WOOD FAR BEHIND THOSE BEAUTIFUL EYES STILL HAUNTED HIM
HE HOWEVER
AS IF TO REGAIN HIS BREATH AND THENCE ONCE MORE DARTED UPON HIS PREY AT THAT INSTANT THE CURTAIN WAS RUDELY TORN ASIDE THE EGYPTIAN FELT A FIERCE AND STRONG GRASP UPON HIS SHOULDER
HE HAD LAID HIS GARLAND ON THE SHRINE
AND AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT A BANQUET ROSE FROM THE FLOOR A COUCH OR THRONE
NOR THE MELANCHOLY AVENUE OF TOMBS NOR THE GLITTERING VILLAS OF A POLISHED AND LUXURIOUS PEOPLE
THEY DESCENDED BY BROAD AND EASY STEPS INTO A GARDEN
SLEEPLESS AND ALONE ON THE SUMMIT OF THE LOFTY AND PYRAMIDAL TOWER WHICH FLANKED HIS HOUSE A TALL PARAPET AROUND IT SERVED AS A WALL AND CONSPIRED
SO HE WROTE A LETTER TO HER
GETTING HIS HORSE READY TO START AND WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS ALLOW HIMSELF TO LOOK AT HER AGAIN BUT WHEN HE WAS IN THE SADDLE JUST SETTING OFF AS HE NODDED GOOD BY TO THE OLD FOLK
AGAIN DO THE STARS FOREWARN ME SOME DANGER THEN ASSUREDLY AWAITS ME SAID HE SLOWLY SOME DANGER VIOLENT AND SUDDEN IN ITS NATURE
HUNG EVERYWHERE WITH BLACK
I SEE HONORS HAPPINESS SUCCESS SHINING UPON EVERY BILLOW OF THE DARK GULF BENEATH WHICH I MUST SINK AT LAST WHAT THEN WITH SUCH DESTINIES BEYOND THE PERIL SHALL I SUCCUMB TO THE PERIL
EACH EVENT TO COME HAS ALSO ITS SPECTRUM ITS SHADE WHEN THE HOUR ARRIVES LIFE ENTERS IT THE SHADOW BECOMES CORPOREAL AND WALKS THE WORLD THUS IN THE LAND BEYOND THE GRAVE
AND THEY WERE BOTH TIRED OUT AT LAST HE SAW A SMALL CLOUD OF BLUE SMOKE RISING AMID THE GREEN TREES AND RIDING TOWARD IT HE SOON CAME TO A LITTLE COTTAGE VERY POOR AND MEAN LOOKING
AH HE MUTTERED AS HE GLARED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WHAT FURY HATH SENT YE HITHER ATE
SOFTLY ARBACES RAISED HIS HAND THE SPECTRE SEEMED TO DROP THE MANTLE THAT CONCEALED ITS FORM
COLD INSENSATE AND MOROSE WHICH I HAVE SEEMED TO THEE NEVER WOMAN HAD LOVER SO DEVOTED SO PASSIONATE AS I WILL BE TO IONE DO NOT STRUGGLE IN MY CLASP SEE I RELEASE THY HAND
BUT MAN IS BLIND THAT WHICH WAS TO COME DIFFICULT WAS IT THEN AND THERE TO GUESS THE CAUSES WHY THE TRADITION OF THE PLACE WORE SO GLOOMY AND STERN A HUE WHY IN THOSE SMILING PLAINS
THE PRINCE WAS QUITE RIGHT THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE IT WAS THEIR DAUGHTER
AS HER PAUSES BETOKEN FOUL HERBS FROM THE VENOMOUS MARSH WELL
AND THE SHADES OF NIGHT MELTED FROM THE STERILE MOUNTAIN TOPS
AND WHETHER HE WOULD OR NOT AT LAST HE SAID TO HIMSELF THERE MUST BE AN END OF THIS
AND THERE SITTING ON A LITTLE MOUND OVER WHICH SPREAD THE GLOOM OF THE DARK GREEN ALOES
YOU MUST NOT TALK TO ME THUS SAID IONE SMILING YOU FORGET THAT YOUR LORE HAS SUFFICIENTLY INSTRUCTED MY MIND TO RENDER THESE GRACEFUL FLATTERIES TO MY PERSON UNWELCOME IT WAS YOU WHO TAUGHT ME TO DISDAIN ADULATION
THE SOFTNESS OF HIS VOICE REASSURED HER AND IN HER OWN PURITY SHE FELT PROTECTION BUT SHE WAS CONFUSED ASTONISHED
WHILE HE SO SPOKE A SOFT AND WARM AND GRADUAL LIGHT DIFFUSED ITSELF AROUND AS IT SPREAD OVER EACH OBJECT
IONE TREMBLE NOT THOU ART MY QUEEN MY GODDESS BE MY BRIDE ALL THE WISHES THOU CANST FORM SHALL BE FULFILLED THE ENDS OF THE EARTH SHALL MINISTER TO THEE POMP
NOR WOMAN EATER EITHER SO FAR AS HE KNEW
THE MUSCLES STRAINED THE VEINS SWELLED THE LIPS APART THE TEETH SET BOTH WERE STRONG BEYOND THE ORDINARY POWER OF MEN BOTH ANIMATED BY RELENTLESS WRATH THEY COILED THEY WOUND AROUND EACH OTHER
ALTHOUGH IT WAS BROAD DAY WITHOUT THE MANSION
BY HIS TREASURES AND HIS ELOQUENCE
HE PACED RAPIDLY THE NARROW SPACE OF THAT STAR ROOFED FLOOR AND PAUSING AT THE PARAPET LOOKED AGAIN UPON THE GREY AND MELANCHOLY HEAVENS THE CHILLS OF THE FAINT DAWN CAME REFRESHINGLY UPON HIS BROW
AND STOOPING EVER AND ANON AS IF TO PLUCK ITS RANK PRODUCE HO SAID HE ALOUD I HAVE THEN ANOTHER COMPANION IN THESE UNWORLDLY NIGHT WATCHES
THE COLUMN TREMBLED AND WAVED FROM SIDE TO SIDE
IS CHARGED BY THE CURSES OF DESTINY AGAINST THEE AND AT NO DISTANT DATE FROM THIS COMES THE PERIL BUT I CANNOT OF A CERTAINTY
WHO NEVER KNELT TO MORTAL BEING KNEEL TO THEE I WHO HAVE COMMANDED FATE
AND SHE CAME RUNNING DOWN TRIPPING ALONG CLAD IN MEAN ATTIRE SO BLITHE AND FRESH AND FAIR
AS HE SPOKE
THE MIGHTY MOTHER CLAIMS THEE AS A LIVING SACRIFICE
BROKEN HERE AND THERE BY JAGGED CRAGS AND COPSES OF WILD FOLIAGE AT THE BASE OF THIS LAY A MARSHY AND UNWHOLESOME POOL AND THE INTENT GAZE OF ARBACES CAUGHT THE OUTLINE OF SOME LIVING FORM MOVING BY THE MARSHES
SO NOW THE PRINCE WAS AT HOME ONCE MORE SURROUNDED BY ALL THE GOOD THINGS IMAGINABLE AND YET HE KNEW NOT ONE MOMENT'S CONTENT
RIGHT UPON HIS BENDED FORM
NO LIGHTS SAVE HERE AND THERE FROM BEFORE THE COLUMNS OF A TEMPLE
THEY APPEARED VERY MUCH ASTONISHED TO SEE SUCH A FINE HANDSOME YOUNG KNIGHT THE PRINCE AFTER WISHING THEM GOOD EVENING
TAUGHT BY HIS SACRED PROFESSION AS WELL AS BY HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ARBACES TO DISTRUST ALL MIRACULOUS INTERPOSITIONS HAD NOT SHARED THE DISMAY OF HIS COMPANION HE RUSHED FORWARD
IT WAS SOME MOMENTS BEFORE SHE COULD RECOVER THE POWER OF REPLY RISE ARBACES SAID SHE AT LENGTH
I PREFER BELIEVING WHAT I HAVE HEARD WITH MY OWN EARS AND YOU MAY AS WELL TELL ME THE PLAIN TRUTH FOR I AM DETERMINED TO LEARN IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO THEN THE OLD MAN MADE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
AND STOOD OVER HER WITH A BRANDISHING KNIFE WATCHING THE CONTEST BETWEEN GLAUCUS AND THE EGYPTIAN
WITH A LOUD AND EXULTING YELL ARBACES BRANDISHED THE KNIFE ON HIGH GLAUCUS GAZED UPON HIS IMPENDING FATE WITH UNWINKING EYES
FROM THE GATE STRETCHED THE LONG STREET OF TOMBS VARIOUS IN SIZE AND ARCHITECTURE BY WHICH ON THAT SIDE THE CITY IS AS YET APPROACHED ABOVE ALL
WILL YOU UNTEACH YOUR PUPIL THERE WAS SOMETHING SO FRANK AND CHARMING IN THE MANNER OF IONE
HE READ IT TO THE END AND THEN AS THE LETTER FELL FROM HIS HAND HE SAID
THAT I AM UNTOUCHED THAT I AM NOT HONORED BY THIS HOMAGE BUT SAY CANST THOU HEAR ME CALMLY AY THOUGH THY WORDS WERE LIGHTNING AND COULD BLAST ME
WILT THOU PROVE MY KNOWLEDGE IONE AND BEHOLD THE REPRESENTATION OF THINE OWN FATE
THE MORNING LIGHT WHICH CAN PALE SO WANLY EVEN THE YOUNG CHEEK OF BEAUTY GAVE HIS MAJESTIC AND STATELY FEATURES ALMOST THE COLORS OF THE GRAVE
BEAUTIFUL IONE SAID ARBACES AS HE BENT TO TOUCH HER HAND IT IS YOU THAT HAVE ECLIPSED THE DAY IT IS YOUR EYES THAT LIGHT UP THE HALLS IT IS YOUR BREATH WHICH FILLS THEM WITH PERFUMES
ARBACES CAME NEARER TO HER HIS BREATH GLOWED FIERCELY ON HER CHEEK HE WOUND HIS ARMS ROUND HER SHE SPRANG FROM HIS EMBRACE IN THE STRUGGLE A TABLET FELL FROM HER BOSOM ON THE GROUND
THE CURTAIN AT THE BACK OF THE ALTAR WAVED TREMULOUSLY TO AND FRO IT PARTED SLOWLY AND IN THE APERTURE WHICH WAS THUS MADE IONE BEHELD AN INDISTINCT AND PALE LANDSCAPE WHICH GRADUALLY GREW BRIGHTER
THE SULTAN AND ALL THOSE WHO SAW THIS OPERATION DID NOT KNOW WHICH TO ADMIRE MOST THE CONSTITUTION OF THE HUNCHBACK WHO HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DEAD FOR A WHOLE NIGHT AND MOST OF ONE DAY OR THE SKILL OF THE BARBER WHOM EVERYONE NOW BEGAN TO LOOK UPON AS A GREAT MAN
MY SOUL WHAT A PRIZE HE RATTLED ON ENTIRELY TO HIMSELF AS IT TURNED OUT FOR THE SAILORS WERE NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN A PET EXHAUSTED FROM THE BATTLE OR DRUNK FROM CAPTURED WINE AND ALL DESPISING THE FASTIDIOUS WAYS OF OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY
CAPTAIN BLIZZARD CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND IN AMOS'S AND NED CILLEY'S HEARING
AMONG THEM WAS THE ACTUAL MURDER OF A WOMAN AS A WITCH BY A MOB IN SHROPSHIRE AND AN ATTACK BY ANOTHER MOB IN ESSEX UPON A PERFECTLY INOFFENSIVE PERSON ON SUSPICION OF HAVING BEWITCHED A SCOLDING ILL CONDITIONED GIRL
TO THINK THAT I ONCE KNEW SUCH A ROYAL SUCH A DISTINGUISHED MAN HE SIGHED REMINISCENTLY FOR THE FIRST TIME WORDS CAME FROM CLAGGETT CHEW HE BIT THEM OFF AS IF THE SAYING OF THEM COST HIM VERY GREAT EFFORT MORE
CHRIS REMAINED ALONE IN THE CABIN FROM THAT TIME SOON IN THE COOL OF THE NIGHT THE SAILORS OF THE MIRABELLE
ANYBODY CAN DO THE LIKE YOU FACE A MISFORTUNE I THINK IT WILL COME UPON YOU WITHIN THREE WEEKS BUT IT MAY NOT A DARK COMPLEXIONED MAN FACES YOUR LIFE CARD
I AM SURE YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED HIM SUCH CHARM
OH MY LORD ANSWERED MY BROTHER WHO BEHELD NEITHER MEAT NOR BREAD NEVER HAVE I TASTED ANYTHING SO DELICIOUS EAT AS MUCH AS YOU WANT SAID THE BARMECIDE I BOUGHT THE WOMAN WHO MAKES IT FOR FIVE HUNDRED PIECES OF GOLD
CHRIS DID NOT DISAPPOINT HIM AS THE PARAKEET HE PLAYED THE CLOWN FOR ALL HE WAS WORTH HE STRUTTED UP AND DOWN AND BOBBED HIS HEAD WHENEVER OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY SPOKE SO THAT IT APPEARED THAT THE BRIGHTLY FEATHERED BIRD WAS IN CONSTANT AGREEMENT WITH HIS CAPTOR
EXCLAIMED THE BARMECIDE HERE SLAVE BRING WATER THAT WE MAY WASH OUR HANDS BEFORE MEAT NO SLAVE APPEARED
FOR THE BARMECIDES WERE FAMED FOR THEIR LIBERALITY AND GENEROSITY MY BROTHER HEARING THIS ASKED THE PORTERS OF WHOM THERE WERE SEVERAL IF THEY WOULD GIVE HIM ALMS
HE THOUGHT THAT FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSE IT MIGHT YIELD HIM A RICH HARVEST SO HE ENTERED AND INQUIRED TO WHOM IT BELONGED MY GOOD MAN WHERE DO YOU COME FROM REPLIED THE SERVANT CAN'T YOU SEE FOR YOURSELF THAT IT CAN BELONG TO NOBODY BUT A BARMECIDE
HOW ANYBODY COULD BELIEVE THAT TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH VERY SMALL RESULTS SELDOM EQUAL EVEN TO THE DEATH OF AN ENEMY ONE WOULD AGREE TO ACCEPT ETERNAL DAMNATION IN THE NEXT WORLD ALMOST CERTAIN POVERTY MISERY PERSECUTION AND TORMENT IN THIS
MY LITTLE FEATHERED CAPTIVE HE SAID AND PONDERED
COARSE AND IGNORANT AND OFTEN RUMMY THEIR FEE IS A QUARTER OR HALF OF A DOLLAR SOMETIMES A DOLLAR THEIR DIVINATION IS WORKED BY CUTTING AND DEALING CARDS OR STUDYING THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
BUT OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY THROWING HIS FINE COAT AND PLUMED HAT TO ONE SIDE LIGHTHEARTEDLY AMUSED HIMSELF BY TRYING TO TEMPT HIS NEW PET WITH SOME FRUIT CLAGGETT HE CRIED AS IF CLAGGETT CHEW COULD POSSIBLY BE INTERESTED IN A PARAKEET AT THAT POINT
AT WURZBURG NINE HUNDRED IN TWO YEARS SPRENGER A GERMAN INQUISITOR GENERAL AND AUTHOR OF A CELEBRATED BOOK ON DETECTING AND PUNISHING WITCHCRAFT CALLED MALLEUS MALEFICARUM OR THE MALLET OF MALEFACTORS
WE CARRIED THE BODY TO THE HOUSE OF A JEWISH PHYSICIAN HE PLACED IT IN THE CHAMBER OF THE PURVEYOR AND THE PURVEYOR PROPPED IT UP IN THE STREET
HOLDING A BOTTLE OF WINE WHICH HE UNCORKED AND POURED INTO A GLASS CHRIS FORESEEING WHAT WOULD FOLLOW HOPPED UP TO THE BACK OF HIS NEW MASTER'S CHAIR WHERE HE HOPED HE WOULD BE FORGOTTEN AND TUCKED HIS HEAD UNDER HIS WING IN CASE OSTERBRIDGE SHOULD LOOK AT HIM
THEY PAID NOT THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION THEY OBEYED OCCASIONAL ORDERS FROM HIM FOR THEY KNEW THEY WOULD BE WHIPPED BY CLAGGETT CHEW IF THEY DID NOT AND SO HAULED UP THE BASKETS OF FRUITS AND FLOWERS DUMPED THEM UNCEREMONIOUSLY IN THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN
TO THAT PERIOD BELONGED THE SALEM WITCHCRAFT OF NEW ENGLAND THE WITCH FINDING OF MATTHEW HOPKINS IN OLD ENGLAND THE SCOTCH WITCH TRIALS AND THE SWEDISH AND GERMAN AND FRENCH WITCH MANIA
WERE TRULY INFERNAL THE CHIEF RULE WAS THAT WITCHCRAFT BEING AN EXCEPTIONAL CRIME NO REGARD NEED BE HAD TO THE ORDINARY FORMS OF JUSTICE ALL MANNER OF TORTURES WERE FREELY APPLIED TO FORCE CONFESSIONS
IN SCOTLAND THE BOOT WAS USED BEING AN IRON CASE IN WHICH THE LEGS ARE LOCKED UP TO THE KNEES AND AN IRON WEDGE THEN DRIVEN IN UNTIL SOMETIMES THE BONES WERE CRUSHED AND THE MARROW SPOUTED OUT PIN STICKING DROWNING
TO THIS MY BROTHER AT FIRST OBJECTED DECLARING THAT IT WAS FORBIDDEN
THEY CONTRASTED SHARPLY AT THAT MOMENT WITH THOSE FROM CIVILIZATION
SILENCE FELL OVER THE CABIN EXCEPT FOR OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY'S DELICATELY SMACKING LIPS AS HE FINISHED THE FRUIT AND LICKED HIS FINGERS ONE BY ONE THE INCREASINGLY HEAVY BREATHING OF CLAGGETT CHEW WHO FELL ASLEEP AND THE DISTANT SOUND OF SHOUTS AND CLAMOR FROM THE SHORE
SUDDENLY HE BURST INTO SUCH LOUD LAUGHTER THAT HE FELL RIGHT BACKWARDS AND WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF ENOUGH TO SPEAK HE TURNED TO THE SULTAN THE MAN IS NO MORE DEAD THAN I AM HE SAID WATCH ME AS HE SPOKE HE DREW A SMALL CASE OF MEDICINES FROM HIS POCKET
IN WHICH HE TOLD HOW MUCH HE THOUGHT OF HIMSELF FOR HAVING CONDEMNED AND BURNED NINE HUNDRED WITCHES IN SIXTEEN YEARS IN LORRAINE AND THE ONE THING THAT HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR WAS THIS THAT OUT OF REGARD FOR THE WISHES OF A COLLEAGUE
STAGGERED ABOUT AIMLESSLY GORGING FOOD AND DRINKING THE WATCHING PAGANS GLANCED FROM THE BRAWLING PIRATES BACK A SHORT DISTANCE DOWN THE BEACH WHERE ALREADY A FEW BODIES HAD BEEN WASHED ASHORE FROM THE FIGHT THEIR DISTASTE AND BEWILDERMENT WERE PLAIN
AND THEN SHOWS THAT A DENIAL OF WITCHCRAFT IS THE WORST OF ALL HERESIES AND MUST BE PUNISHED WITH DEATH QUITE A NUMBER OF EXCELLENT AND SENSIBLE PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY BURNT ON JUST THIS PRINCIPLE
YOU HAVE HAD THE GOOD GRACE TO FALL IN WITH MY HUMOUR AND TO PRETEND TO EAT AND TO DRINK WHEN NOTHING WAS THERE
THE DEVIL PART OF THE BUSINESS DID NOT BEGIN UNTIL A GOOD WHILE AFTER CHRIST DURING THE LAST CENTURY OR SO AGAIN WHILE WITCHCRAFT HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY BELIEVED IN THE WITCH HAS DEGENERATED INTO A VERY VULGAR AND POVERTY STRICKEN SORT OF CONJURING WOMAN
SHE FAVORS THE DARK COMPLEXIONED MAN WHICH MEANS TROUBLE YOU FACE MONEY BUT YOU MUST EARN IT THERE IS A GOOD DEAL BUT YOU MAY NOT GET MUCH OF IT ET CETERA ET CETERA
OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY MADE A POUTING FACE AT THE SLEEPING FIGURE OF CHEW EVIDENTLY OSTERBRIDGE WAS BORED HE WENT TO THE DOOR AND CLAPPED HIS HANDS BUT NO ONE RESPONDED EXCEPT FOR THE TWO MEN AND THE PARAKEET THE VULTURE WAS DESERTED
SO ALL HIS POSSESSIONS WENT TO THE PRINCE THEY EVEN DESPOILED MY BROTHER OF THOSE THAT RIGHTLY BELONGED TO HIM AND HE NOW AS POOR AS HE HAD EVER BEEN IN HIS LIFE DECIDED TO CAST IN HIS LOT WITH A CARAVAN OF PILGRIMS WHO WERE ON THEIR WAY TO MECCA
THESE WORDS ARE EXACTLY THE SORT OF STUFF THAT IS SOLD BY THE WITCHES OF TO DAY BUT THE GREATEST WITCH HUMBUG OF ALL THE WITCHCRAFT OF HISTORY IS THAT OF CHRISTENDOM FOR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BEGINNING ABOUT THE TIME OF THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA
OLD DINNERS AND OTHER MERELY SUBLUNARY SMELLS THEIR ROOMS ARE VERY ILL FURNISHED AND OFTEN BESET WITH WASH TUBS SWILL PAILS MOPS AND SOILED CLOTHES THEIR PERSONAL APPEARANCE IS COMMONLY UNCLEAN HOMELY VULGAR
DO LOOK AT WHAT I CAPTURED THIS IS MY VERY OWN SPOILS OF WAR HE CROWED CLAGGETT CHEW MADE AN IMPOLITE NOISE AND SAID NOTHING WELL OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY GAVE A SHRUG AS ANSWER TO THE NOISE YOU KNOW HOW I DETEST FIGHTING
AT THIS THE BARMECIDE INSTEAD OF BEING ANGRY BEGAN TO LAUGH AND EMBRACED HIM HEARTILY I HAVE LONG BEEN SEEKING HE EXCLAIMED A MAN OF YOUR DESCRIPTION AND HENCEFORTH MY HOUSE SHALL BE YOURS
WHEN HE HAD ACCUSED HIM OF BEING A GREAT CHATTER BOX HOWEVER WE WISHED TO KEEP HIM WITH US AND SHARE OUR FEAST
HE CRIED THAT WHILE I AM IN BAGDAD A MAN LIKE YOU SHOULD BE STARVING THAT IS A STATE OF THINGS THAT MUST AT ONCE BE PUT AN END TO NEVER SHALL IT BE SAID THAT I HAVE ABANDONED YOU AND I AM SURE THAT YOU ON YOUR PART WILL NEVER ABANDON ME
MANY WERE CHEATED INTO CONFESSION BY THE PROMISE OF PARDON AND RELEASE AND THEN BURNED A POOR WOMAN IN GERMANY WAS TRICKED BY THE HANGMAN WHO DRESSED HIMSELF UP AS A DEVIL AND WENT INTO HER CELL OVERPOWERED BY PAIN
FEAR AND SUPERSTITION SHE BEGGED HIM TO HELP HER OUT HER BESEECHING WAS TAKEN FOR CONFESSION SHE WAS BURNED AND A BALLAD WHICH TREATED THE TRICK AS A JOLLY AND COMICAL DEVICE WAS LONG POPULAR IN THE COUNTRY
AT OFFENBURG WHEN THE PRISONERS HAD BEEN TORTURED UNTIL BEYOND THE POWER OF SPEAKING ALOUD THEY SILENTLY ASSENTED TO ABOMINABLE CONFESSIONS READ TO THEM OUT OF A BOOK
MY BROTHER THANKED THEM FOR THEIR COURTESY AND ENTERED THE BUILDING WHICH WAS SO LARGE THAT IT TOOK HIM SOME TIME TO REACH THE APARTMENTS OF THE BARMECIDE AT LAST IN A ROOM RICHLY DECORATED WITH PAINTINGS
AS MUCH IRRITATED WITH ME AS EVER SO SAYING THE TAILOR WENT ON TO RELATE THE STORY OF THE LAME MAN AND THE BARBER WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN TOLD WHEN THE BARBER HE CONTINUED HAD FINISHED HIS TALE WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN RIGHT
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT I RENDERED TO THE YOUNG CRIPPLE THE IMPORTANT SERVICE OF WHICH YOU HAVE HEARD AND FOR WHICH AS YOU KNOW HE SHOWED SUCH PROFOUND INGRATITUDE THAT HE PREFERRED RATHER TO LEAVE BAGDAD THAN TO RUN THE RISK OF SEEING ME I SOUGHT HIM LONG FROM PLACE TO PLACE
I REALLY AM NOT LOSING TIME AND I DO FULL JUSTICE TO THE REPAST HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS BREAD
MY LORD ANSWERED MY BROTHER I SWEAR THAT I HAVE NOT BROKEN MY FAST THIS WHOLE DAY
THIS SIRE IS THE STORY WHICH I WAS OBLIGED TO TELL TO SATISFY YOUR HIGHNESS IT IS NOW FOR YOU TO SAY IF WE DESERVE MERCY OR PUNISHMENT LIFE OR DEATH
HE PAUSED ADMIRING THE VIVID COLORS OF THE FEATHERS WHICH PERHAPS AWOKE A KINDRED FEELING IN OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY
NO SOUND FROM CLAGGETT CHEW OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY RATTLED ON AND CHRIS PECKING AT THE FRUIT PROFFERED HIM THOUGHT THAT SOMETIMES OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY MIGHT QUITE POSSIBLY TALK JUST AS GAILY TO HIMSELF AS HE DID TO THE UNRESPONSIVE CLAGGETT CHEW
WHO WHEN I HAD FINISHED BURST INTO FITS OF LAUGHTER WELL WERE YOU CALLED THE SILENT SAID HE NO NAME WAS EVER BETTER DESERVED
OR HE WOULD COCK HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE AS IF WEIGHING ONE OF OSTERBRIDGE'S REMARKS IN A TRULY COMICAL MANNER LOOKING ABOUT MEANWHILE WITH HIS BLACK BEADY EYES CHRIS SAW THAT CLAGGETT CHEW WAS LYING IN A BUNK AGAINST ONE WALL
RISING HIGHER AS IT WENT BELOW THE FEW LIGHTS OF THE SHIP HAD BEEN CAREFULLY HOODED AWAY FROM THE SEA
THEY ARE IF THE BELIEF AND PRACTICE OF WITCHCRAFT AMONG THEM IS ANY TEST FOR IN ALL THOSE COUNTRIES THERE ARE WITCHES I TAKE UP ONE OF THE NEW YORK CITY DAILIES OF THIS VERY MORNING AND FIND IN IT THE ADVERTISEMENTS OF SEVEN WITCHES
AND RUBBED THE NECK OF THE HUNCHBACK WITH SOME OINTMENT MADE OF BALSAM NEXT HE OPENED THE DEAD MAN'S MOUTH AND BY THE HELP OF A PAIR OF PINCERS DREW THE BONE FROM HIS THROAT AT THIS THE HUNCHBACK SNEEZED STRETCHED HIMSELF AND OPENED HIS EYES
WITCHCRAFT IS ONE OF THE MOST BASELESS ABSURD DISGUSTING AND SILLY OF ALL THE HUMBUGS AND IT IS NOT A DEAD HUMBUG EITHER IT IS ALIVE BUSILY EXERCISED BY KNAVES AND BELIEVED BY FOOLS ALL OVER THE WORLD
WITH NUMEROUS DETAILS AND THEY WERE BURNT ALIVE FOR THEIR TROUBLE THE EXTENT OF WHOLESALE MURDERING PERPETRATED UNDER FORMS OF LAW ON CHARGES OF WITCHCRAFT IS ASTONISHING A MAGISTRATE NAMED REMIGIUS PUBLISHED A BOOK
HASTILY CHANGING HIMSELF INTO A GREEN PARAKEET CHRIS ALIGHTED ON THE RAIL OF THE VULTURE JUST AS OSTERBRIDGE HAWSEY REACHED THE TOP OF THE LADDER DETERMINED TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION AND PERHAPS CATCH OSTERBRIDGE'S FANCY
SOMETHING FRENCH UNDOUBTEDLY HE WAVED A HAND AND THE LACE AT HIS WRIST FELL FORWARD IN A NOT OVERLY CLEAN FRILL LOUIS AFTER THE DEAR KING NO THAT WOULD BE TOO GREAT AN HONOR FOR SO SMALL A BIRD GAUDY THOUGH YOU ARE I THINK
SO THAT I MIGHT NEVER BE WITHOUT IT AFTER ORDERING A VARIETY OF DISHES WHICH NEVER CAME TO BE PLACED ON THE TABLE AND DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF EACH ONE THE BARMECIDE DECLARED THAT HAVING DINED SO WELL THEY WOULD NOW PROCEED TO TAKE THEIR WINE
AND HE KNEW HE MUST DO IT AND AT ONCE THE BOY LOOKED A LAST TIME AROUND THE CABIN THEN SPOKE THE MAGIC FORMULA IN HIS MIND AND WITH A SUDDEN ENJOYMENT IN THE SENSE OF FLIGHT HE SOARED AWAY FROM THE SHIP
THAT WAS DONE BY PETER AND JOHN THAT PRAYER BEING MADE FOR THEM AND HANDS IMPOSED THE HOLY GHOST SHOULD BE INVOKED AND POURED FORTH UPON THEM WHICH NOW ALSO IS DONE AMONGST US
THAT THEY MAY STEADFASTLY PROFESS THEIR FAITH AND LEAD UPRIGHT LIVES THIS SACRAMENT IS CALLED CONFIRMATION BECAUSE IT CONFIRMS OR STRENGTHENS THE SOUL BY DIVINE GRACE
AND THE SHOGUN'S MEN DRIVEN OUT OF THE PLACE
IN THE MOUNTAINS OF NIKKO HAS NO QUIETER RESTING PLACE THAN HIS DESCENDANTS IN THE HEART OF THE CITY OVER WHICH THEY RULED BESIDES THE GRAVES OF THE SHOGUNS ZOJOJI CONTAINS OTHER LESSER SHRINES IN WHICH ARE BURIED THE WIVES OF THE SECOND SIXTH AND ELEVENTH SHOGUNS
SEEING THAT THE ABBOT WAS NO ORDINARY MAN STOPPED AND ASKED HIS NAME AND ENTERED THE TEMPLE TO REST HIMSELF THE SMOOTH SPOKEN MONK SOON FOUND SUCH FAVOUR WITH IYEYASU
FOR IT IS TEN FEET HIGH AND FIVE FEET EIGHT INCHES IN DIAMETER WHILE ITS METAL IS A FOOT THICK IT WAS HUNG UP IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE BUT THE CHIEF OBJECTS OF INTEREST IN THESE BEAUTIFUL GROUNDS ARE THE CHAPELS ATTACHED TO THE TOMBS OF THE SHOGUNS
A GREAT CISTERN CUT OUT OF A SINGLE BLOCK OF STONE LIKE A SARCOPHAGUS AND A SMALLER NUMBER OF LANTERNS OF BRONZE THESE ARE GIVEN BY THE GO SAN KE THE THREE PRINCELY FAMILIES IN WHICH THE SUCCESSION TO THE OFFICE OF SHOGUN WAS VESTED
THE FOUNDER OF THE JODO SECT OF BUDDHISM THAT TO WHICH THE TEMPLE BELONGS
WHO TAKES SUCH GOOD CARE OF HIS FAITHFUL VOTARIES TO HIM THIS TEMPLE IS DEDICATED A COLOSSAL BRONZE BUDDHA TWENTY TWO FEET HIGH
AND THE PANELS OF THE WALLS ARE SCULPTURED IN HIGH RELIEF WITH ADMIRABLE REPRESENTATIONS OF BIRDS AND FLOWERS LIFE SIZE LIFE LIKE ALL BEING COLOURED TO IMITATE NATURE INSIDE THIS ENCLOSURE STANDS A SHRINE BEFORE THE CLOSED DOOR OF WHICH A PRIEST ON ONE SIDE
BUT IYEYASU IS NOT BURIED HERE
SO THAT THEY WHO ARE BAPTIZED IN THE CHURCH ARE PRESENTED TO THE BISHOPS OF THE CHURCH AND BY OUR PRAYER AND IMPOSITION OF HANDS
AND THE MUSIC OF BELLS OF EXQUISITE DESIGNS HARMONIOUS COLOURING RICH GILDING
MAY NOURISH ITS ROOTS UNTIL IT TAKES DEEP ROOT AND IT NO LONGER REQUIRES ANY SPECIAL CARE SO THE CHURCH IN HER INFANCY HAD TO BE NOURISHED BY THE MIRACULOUS POWER OF GOD
AT THESE THE VISITOR IS WARNED BY A NOTICE TO TAKE OFF HIS BOOTS A REQUEST WHICH ENGLISHMEN WITH CHARACTERISTIC DISREGARD OF THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS USUALLY NEGLECT TO COMPLY WITH THE MAIN HALL OF THE TEMPLE IS OF LARGE PROPORTIONS
AND TO GIVE DIVINE SANCTION TO THE APOSTOLIC MINISTRY BUT NOW THAT THE CHURCH IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED AND THE DIVINE AUTHORITY OF HER MINISTRY IS CLEARLY RECOGNIZED THESE MIRACLES ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY
INSIDE THIS IS A THIRD COURT PARTLY COVERED LIKE A CLOISTER THE APPROACH TO WHICH IS A DOORWAY OF EVEN GREATER BEAUTY AND RICHNESS THAN THE LAST THE CEILING IS GILT AND PAINTED WITH ARABESQUES AND WITH HEAVENLY ANGELS PLAYING ON MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
FOR THERE IS NO WARRANT FOR SUCH AN ASSUMPTION THIS FUNCTION OF IMPOSING HANDS FORMED AS REGULAR AND IMPERATIVE A PART OF THE APOSTOLIC MINISTRY AS THE DUTIES WHICH THEY EXERCISED IN PREACHING BAPTIZING ORDAINING ET CETERA
LYING ON ONE SIDE OF A SPLENDID AVENUE OF SCOTCH FIRS WHICH BORDER A BROAD WELL KEPT GRAVEL WALK PASSING THROUGH A SMALL GATEWAY OF RARE DESIGN
SEVERAL GREAT FESTIVALS WHICH ARE SPECIALLY CELEBRATED AT ZOJOJI THE CHIEF OF THESE ARE THE KAISANKI OR FOUNDER'S DAY WHICH IS ON THE EIGHTEENTH DAY OF THE SEVENTH MONTH THE TWENTY FIFTH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF THE MONK HONEN
AND IS AN AMPLE REFUTATION OF THOSE WHO WOULD ASCRIBE TO IT A MORE RECENT ORIGIN PROTESTANTISM WHICH MADE SUCH HAVOC OF THE OTHER SACRAMENTS DID NOT FAIL TO ABOLISH CONFIRMATION IN ITS SWEEPING REVOLUTION THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH RETAINS INDEED
IS HUNG ALONG THE WALLS THE BIG BELL OUTSIDE THE MAIN HALL IS RATHER REMARKABLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT BEAUTY OF THE DEEP BASS WAVES OF SOUND WHICH IT ROLLS THROUGH THE CITY THAN ON ACCOUNT OF ITS SIZE
SOMETIMES IT IS NAMED THE LAYING ON OF HANDS BECAUSE THE BISHOP IMPOSES HIS HANDS ON THOSE WHOM HE CONFIRMS IT IS ALSO KNOWN BY THE NAME OF CHRISM BECAUSE THE FOREHEAD OF THE PERSON CONFIRMED
NOW SOME OF THESE CHURCHES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SINCE THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES THIS FACT IS AN ELOQUENT VINDICATION OF THE APOSTOLIC ANTIQUITY OF CONFIRMATION
INSTEAD OF DISMOUNTING AT THE USUAL PLACE AND PROCEEDING ON FOOT THROUGH SEVERAL GATES AND COURTYARDS NOR WERE THE PRIVILEGES OF THE TEMPLE CONFINED TO BARREN HONOURS
CHARMING DELICIOUS GRAND BEAUTIFUL
THEY SENT UNTO THEM PETER AND JOHN
WHEN THEY WERE COME PRAYED FOR THEM THAT THEY MIGHT RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST FOR HE WAS NOT YET COME UPON ANY OF THEM
THE SERMON MAY HAVE BEEN PREACHED BY DESIGN OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN BY ACCIDENT BUT THE LESSON IS THERE THERE IS LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THREE SHRINES ALL OF WHICH ARE DECORATED IN THE SAME MANNER IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO JUSTICE TO THEIR BEAUTY IN WORDS
LINED WITH A LONG ARRAY OF COLOSSAL STONE LANTERNS THE GIFT OF THE VASSALS OF THE DEPARTED PRINCE A SECOND GATEWAY
WENT AND PRAYED FOR A THOUSAND DAYS AT THE TEMPLE OF THE THOUSAND HANDED KWANNON AT KIYOMIDZU IN KIYOTO HIS RETREAT HAVING BEEN DISCOVERED HE WAS SEIZED AND BROUGHT BOUND TO KAMAKURA THE CHIEF TOWN OF THE HOUSE OF GEN HERE
INDEED IF YOU WISH TO SEE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SPOTS OF ANY ORIENTAL CITY ASK FOR THE CEMETERIES THE HOMES OF THE DEAD ARE EVER THE LOVELIEST PLACES
IT RAISES INDEED ITS HANDS OVER THE CANDIDATES BUT THEY ARE NOT THE ANOINTED HANDS OF PETER OR JOHN OR CYPRIAN OR AUGUSTINE TO WHOM IT IS SAID WHATSOEVER THOU SHALT BLESS LET IT BE BLESSED
ALAS THE MAIN TEMPLE THE HALL IN HONOUR OF THE SECT TO WHICH IT BELONGS THE HALL OF SERVICES THE BELL TOWER THE ENTRANCE HALL AND THE RESIDENCE OF THE PRINCE OF THE BLOOD
HE WAS CONDEMNED TO DIE AT A PLACE CALLED YUI BY THE SEA SHORE BUT EVERY TIME THAT THE EXECUTIONER LIFTED HIS SWORD TO STRIKE THE BLADE WAS BROKEN BY THE GOD KWANNON
AS AN EARNEST OF FUTURE GLORY
AND A RETAINER OF THE HOUSE OF TOKUGAWA ON THE OTHER SIT MOUNTING GUARD MUTE AND IMMOVABLE AS THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES WERE PART OF THE CARVED ORNAMENTS PASSING ON ONE SIDE OF THE SHRINE WE COME TO ANOTHER COURT PLAINER THAN THE LAST
AMONG THESE IS A TEMPLE IN THE FORM OF A ROOFLESS STAGE IN HONOUR OF THE THOUSAND HANDED KWANNON
AND WHO DIED YOUNG AT HIS DEATH FIVE OF HIS RETAINERS WITH ONE OGASASAWARA KEMMOTSU AT THEIR HEAD
REMEMBER HE SAYS THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE SPIRITUAL SEAL THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING THE SPIRIT OF COUNSEL AND FORTITUDE THE SPIRIT OF KNOWLEDGE AND PIETY
AND AT THE SAME TIME GREW INTO STRONG HEALTHY WOMANHOOD I WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN WHEN WE REMOVED FROM VIRGINIA TO HILLSBORO NORTH CAROLINA
THESE CONDITIONS GIVE HER THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE SURGEON'S INSTRUMENTS AND THE SACRIFICING OF WHAT IS HIGHEST AND HOLIEST IN HER HER ASPIRATION TO FREEDOM HER DESIRE TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN ALREADY HERS THESE CONDITIONS NOT THE WOMAN OUTFACE SOCIETY WITH THIS QUESTION
BUT THESE WORDS SO MAGICAL TO THE OFFICIAL MIND HAVE NO WEIGHT WHEN THESE SAME OFFICIALS ARE ADJUSTING THEIR OWN PRIVATE LIVES THEY THEN OBEY THE HIGHER LAWS OF THEIR OWN BEINGS THEY BREAK THE OBSOLETE STATUTES FOR THEMSELVES WHILE ENFORCING THEM FOR OTHERS
THE WOMB MAY NOT RETURN TO ITS NATURAL SIZE BUT REMAIN LARGE AND HEAVY TENDING TO FALL AWAY FROM ITS NATURAL POSITION ABORTION OFTEN LEAVES THE UTERUS IN A CONDITION TO CONCEIVE EASILY AGAIN AND UNLESS PREVENTION IS STRICTLY FOLLOWED ANOTHER PREGNANCY WILL SURELY OCCUR
THIS ACT MADE IT A CRIME TO USE THE MAILS TO CONVEY CONTRACEPTIVES OR INFORMATION CONCERNING CONTRACEPTIVES OTHER ACTS LATER MADE THE ORIGINAL LAW APPLICABLE TO EXPRESS COMPANIES AND OTHER COMMON CARRIERS AS WELL AS TO THE MAILS WITH THIS PRECEDENT ESTABLISHED
I WAS THUNDERSTRUCK AND TRIED TO THINK IF I HAD BEEN REMISS IN ANYTHING I COULD NOT RECOLLECT OF DOING ANYTHING TO DESERVE PUNISHMENT AND WITH SURPRISE EXCLAIMED WHIP ME MISTER BINGHAM WHAT FOR NO MATTER HE REPLIED
IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE HOWEVER A NEW SECTION SAID TO HAVE BEEN DRAFTED BY COMSTOCK HIMSELF
IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT AMERICA STANDS AT THE HEAD OF ALL NATIONS IN THE HUGE NUMBER OF ABORTIONS THERE IS THE CASE IN A NUTSHELL FAMILY LIMITATION WILL ALWAYS BE PRACTICED AS IT IS NOW BEING PRACTICED EITHER BY BIRTH CONTROL OR BY ABORTION WE KNOW THAT
THIS IS CALLED THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD IT OCCURS ABOUT ONCE A MONTH OR EVERY TWENTY EIGHT DAYS IN THE MALE ORGANS THERE ARE GLANDS CALLED TESTES THEY SECRETE A FLUID CALLED THE SEMEN IN THE SEMEN IS THE LIFE GIVING PRINCIPLE CALLED THE SPERM
I AM GOING TO WHIP YOU SO TAKE DOWN YOUR DRESS THIS INSTANT RECOLLECT I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS A WOMAN FULLY DEVELOPED AND YET THIS MAN COOLLY BADE ME TAKE DOWN MY DRESS I DREW MYSELF UP PROUDLY FIRMLY
THOUGH IT IS QUITE LATE IN THE DAY TO BE THANKING FOR THEM TELL AUNT BELLA THAT I WAS VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HER FOR HER PRESENT I HAVE BEEN SO PARTICULAR WITH IT THAT I HAVE ONLY WORN IT ONCE THERE HAVE BEEN SIX WEDDINGS SINCE OCTOBER
WHO UNDERGO THE AGONY OF ABORTION EACH YEAR THIS HAND REACHES OUT TO COMPEL THE BIRTH OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INFANTS WHO MUST DIE BEFORE THEY ARE TWELVE MONTHS OLD LIKE MANY LAWS UPON OUR STATUTE BOOKS THESE ARE BEING PERSISTENTLY AND INTELLIGENTLY VIOLATED
I WAS THEIR ONLY SERVANT AND A GRACIOUS LOAN AT THAT
NEARLY ALL OF THE ONE MILLION OR TWO MILLION WOMEN WHO UNDERGO ABORTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES EACH YEAR
WHEN HE SEIZED A HEAVY STICK AND BEAT ME WITH IT IN A SHAMEFUL MANNER AGAIN I WENT HOME SORE AND BLEEDING BUT WITH PRIDE AS STRONG AND DEFIANT AS EVER THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY MISTER BINGHAM AGAIN TRIED TO CONQUER ME BUT IN VAIN WE STRUGGLED
IS NOT AN ARTICLE OF INDECENT OR IMMORAL NATURE OR USE WITHIN THIS ARTICLE THE SUPPLYING OF SUCH ARTICLES TO SUCH PHYSICIANS OR BY THEIR DIRECTION OR PRESCRIPTION IS NOT AN OFFENSE UNDER THIS ARTICLE
THIS IS NOT THE SITUATION WITH THE POORER PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES HOWEVER MILLIONS OF THEM KNOW NOTHING OF RELIABLE CONTRACEPTIVES WHEN WOMEN OF THE IMPOVERISHED STRATA OF SOCIETY DO NOT BREAK THESE LAWS AGAINST CONTRACEPTIVES
IT IS THE DEAD HAND THAT HOLDS IMPRISONED WITHIN THE OBSCENITY LAWS ALL DIRECT INFORMATION CONCERNING BIRTH CONTROL IT IS THE DEAD HAND THAT THUS COMPELS MILLIONS OF AMERICAN WOMEN TO REMAIN IN THE BONDAGE OF MATERNITY PREVIOUS TO THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT
ANY ATTEMPT AT REMOVING IT OR STOPPING ITS FURTHER GROWTH IS CALLED ABORTION THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WOMEN ARE APT TO LOOK UPON ABORTION AS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE AND TO TREAT IT ACCORDINGLY
SHE WHOM I CALLED MISTRESS SEEMED TO BE DESIROUS TO WREAK VENGEANCE ON ME FOR SOMETHING
ONLY TO DECIDE AT LAST WHEN DRUGS HAVE FAILED AS THEY USUALLY DO TO BRING THE CHILD TO BIRTH THERE ARE NO STATISTICS OF COURSE BY WHICH WE MAY COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF SUFFERING TO MOTHER AND CHILD FROM THE USE OF SUCH DRUGS
AND I FLATTER MYSELF THAT THE ACTIONS OF THOSE WHO HAD CONSPIRED AGAINST ME WERE NOT VIEWED IN A LIGHT TO REFLECT MUCH CREDIT UPON THEM THE SAVAGE EFFORTS TO SUBDUE MY PRIDE WERE NOT THE ONLY THINGS THAT BROUGHT ME SUFFERING AND DEEP MORTIFICATION DURING MY RESIDENCE AT HILLSBORO
THE DARKNESS THAT SURROUNDED THE WHOLE FIELD OF SEX WAS MADE AS COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE SINCE THEN THE FEELING OF THE AWAKENED WOMEN OF AMERICA HAS INTENSIFIED
IN THE BIRTH CONTROL MOVEMENT SHE HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO FIGHT FOR HER RIGHT TO HAVE WITHOUT LEGAL INTERFERENCE ALL KNOWLEDGE PERTAINING TO HER SEX NATURE THIS IS THE THIRD AND MOST IMPORTANT OF THE EPOCH MAKING BATTLES FOR GENERAL LIBERTY UPON AMERICAN SOIL
TO REFORGE OUR CHAINS WHEN WE HAVE BROKEN THEM TO ARREST PROGRESS IT IS THE HAND OF SUCH AS HAVE LIVED ON EARTH BUT HAVE NOT LOVED HUMANITY AT THE CALL OF THOSE WHO FEAR PROGRESS AND FREEDOM IT RISES FROM THE GLOOM OF FORGOTTEN THINGS TO OPPRESS THE LIVING
WILL ALSO ENABLE US TO COMPREHEND MORE THOROUGHLY THE DANGERS TO WHICH WOMAN IS EXPOSED BY OUR ANTIQUATED LAWS AND HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD BE FOR HER TO EMPLOY SUCH PREVENTIVE MEASURES
THE ABORTIONIST COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS PRACTICE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE FACT THAT WOMEN COME DESPERATELY BEGGING FOR SUCH OPERATIONS HE COULD NOT STAY OUT OF JAIL A DAY IF WOMEN DID NOT SO GENERALLY APPROVE OF HIS SERVICES
ARE HEMORRHAGE RETENTION OF AN ADHERENT PLACENTA SEPSIS TETANUS PERFORATION OF THE UTERUS THEY ALSO CAUSE STERILITY ANEMIA MALIGNANT DISEASES DISPLACEMENTS NEUROSIS AND ENDOMETRITIS IN PLAIN EVERYDAY LANGUAGE
FOR I WAS SUFFERING MENTAL AS WELL AS BODILY TORTURE MY SPIRIT REBELLED AGAINST THE UNJUSTNESS THAT HAD BEEN INFLICTED UPON ME AND THOUGH I TRIED TO SMOTHER MY ANGER AND TO FORGIVE THOSE WHO HAD BEEN SO CRUEL TO ME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE NEXT MORNING I WAS MORE CALM
THE ONE MEANS HEALTH AND HAPPINESS A STRONGER BETTER RACE THE OTHER MEANS DISEASE SUFFERING DEATH THE WOMAN WHO GOES TO THE ABORTIONIST'S TABLE IS NOT A CRIMINAL BUT A MARTYR A MARTYR TO THE BITTER UNTHINKABLE CONDITIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE BLINDNESS OF SOCIETY AT LARGE
IT CAN DO NO HARM TO MAKE THE INTENT OF THE LAW AS REGARDS PHYSICIANS PLAINER AND IT WOULD BE AN IMMENSE STEP FORWARD TO INCLUDE NURSES AND MIDWIVES IN THE SECTION WITH THIS ADDITION IT WOULD REMOVE ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS OBSTACLES TO THE FREEDOM AND ADVANCEMENT OF AMERICAN WOMANHOOD
AT A CERTAIN AGE VARYING SLIGHTLY WITH THE INDIVIDUAL
DEAF ALIKE TO THEIR ENTREATIES AND TO THE LESSONS OF HISTORY AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THIS BOOK CHILD ABANDONMENT AND INFANTICIDE ARE BY NO MEANS OBSOLETE PRACTICES AS FOR ABORTION IT HAS NOT DECREASED BUT INCREASED WITH THE ADVANCE OF CIVILIZATION
BUT THE KIND WORD WAS NOT PROFFERED AND IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THAT I GREW SOMEWHAT WAYWARD AND SULLEN THOUGH I HAD FAULTS I KNOW NOW AS I FELT THEN
THEY MAKE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SCIENTIFIC WORKS OF HUMAN EMANCIPATORS LIKE FOREL AND ELLIS AND PRINTED MATTER SUCH AS THEY ARE OSTENSIBLY AIMED AT NATURALLY ENOUGH THEN DETECTIVES AND NARROW MINDED JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS WHO WOULD CHUCKLE OVER PICTURES THAT WOULD MAKE A CLEAN MINDED WOMAN SHUDDER
I WAS SO BADLY BRUISED THAT I WAS UNABLE TO LEAVE MY BED FOR FIVE DAYS I WILL NOT DWELL UPON THE BITTER ANGUISH OF THESE HOURS FOR EVEN THE THOUGHT OF THEM NOW MAKES ME SHUDDER
ONE MORNING HE WENT TO THE WOOD PILE TOOK AN OAK BROOM CUT THE HANDLE OFF
WHEN SCIENTIFIC MEANS ARE EMPLOYED TO PREVENT THIS MEETING ONE IS SAID TO PRACTICE BIRTH CONTROL THE MEANS USED IS KNOWN AS A CONTRACEPTIVE
SO YOU CAN SEE WITH THESE TROUBLES TO OVERCOME MY CHANCE WAS RATHER SLIM I MUST NOW CLOSE ALTHOUGH I COULD FILL TEN PAGES WITH MY GRIEFS AND MISFORTUNES NO TONGUE COULD EXPRESS THEM AS I FEEL DON'T FORGET ME THOUGH AND ANSWER MY LETTERS SOON
WHEN THE NIGHT CAME I WAS IN QUITE A TROUBLE I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER MY FROCK WAS CLEAN OR DIRTY I ONLY HAD A WEEK'S NOTICE AND THE BODY AND SLEEVES TO MAKE AND ONLY ONE HOUR EVERY NIGHT TO WORK ON IT
AND BEGAN TO PLY IT FREELY OVER MY SHOULDERS WITH STEADY HAND AND PRACTISED EYE HE WOULD RAISE THE INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE NERVE HIMSELF FOR A BLOW
FEW REACTIONARIES WILL DARE TO FACE THE PUBLIC DERISION THAT WILL GREET THEIR ATTEMPTS TO USE THEM TO STAY WOMAN'S PROGRESS THE FRENCH HAVE A SAYING CONCERNING MORT MAIN THE DEAD HAND THIS HAND OF THE PAST REACHES UP INTO THE PRESENT TO SMOTHER THE RISING FLAME OF MODERN IDEALS
AND WHO ARE NOT YET SUFFERING FROM DISEASES COMPLICATED BY PREGNANCY
ON ENTERING THE ROOM I FOUND HIM PREPARED WITH A NEW ROPE AND A NEW COWHIDE I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS READY TO DIE BUT THAT HE COULD NOT CONQUER ME IN STRUGGLING WITH HIM I BIT HIS FINGER SEVERELY
AND I STOOD LIKE A STATUE WHILE THE KEEN LASH CUT DEEP INTO MY FLESH AS SOON AS I WAS RELEASED STUNNED WITH PAIN BRUISED AND BLEEDING I WENT HOME AND RUSHED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE PASTOR AND HIS WIFE WILDLY EXCLAIMING MASTER ROBERT
MASCULINE MINDED PERSON WHO INSIST UPON RETAINING THE ABOMINABLE LEGAL RESTRICTIONS TRY AS THEY WILL THEY CANNOT ESCAPE THE TRUTH NOR HIDE IT UNDER THE CLOAK OF STUPID HYPOCRISY IF THE LAWS AGAINST IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENTIFIC BIRTH CONTROL WERE REPEALED
IS NOT A VIOLATION OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT SHOULD WITHOUT DOUBT INCLUDE MIDWIVES AS WELL AS NURSES THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO NEVER SEE A NURSE OR A PHYSICIAN UNDER THIS SECTION EVEN AS IT NOW STANDS PHYSICIANS HAVE A RIGHT TO PRESCRIBE CONTRACEPTIVES
NEARLY ALL OF THESE WOMEN WILL FALL INTO ONE OF TWO GENERAL GROUPS THE ONES WHO ARE HAVING CHILDREN AGAINST THEIR WILLS AND THOSE WHO TO ESCAPE THIS EVIL FIND REFUGE IN ABORTION BEING GIVEN THEIR CHOICE BY SOCIETY TO CONTINUE TO BE OVERBURDENED MOTHERS
BUT MISS ANNA SAYS IT IS TIME I HAD FINISHED TELL MISS ELIZABETH THAT I WISH SHE WOULD MAKE HASTE AND GET MARRIED FOR MISTRESS SAYS THAT I BELONG TO HER WHEN SHE GETS MARRIED
IT IS EACH WOMAN'S DUTY TO HERSELF AND TO SOCIETY TO HASTEN THE REPEAL OF ALL LAWS AGAINST THE COMMUNICATION OF BIRTH CONTROL INFORMATION NOW THAT SHE HAS THE VOTE SHE SHOULD USE HER POLITICAL INFLUENCE TO STRIKE FIRST OF ALL AT THESE RESTRICTIVE STATUTES
I LOVE YOU ALL VERY DEARLY AND SHALL ALTHOUGH I MAY NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN NOR DO I EVER EXPECT TO MISS ANNA IS GOING TO PETERSBURGH NEXT WINTER BUT SHE SAYS THAT SHE DOES NOT INTEND TAKE ME
ESCAPE OVERBREEDING BY THE USE OF CONTRACEPTIVES A SIMILARLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN NOT IN COMFORTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE FORCED TO SUBMIT TO FORCED MATERNITY BECAUSE THEIR ONLY ALTERNATIVE AT PRESENT IS ABORTION
WHO EXPOUNDED THE HOLY SCRIPTURES SABBATH AFTER SABBATH FROM THE PULPIT WHEN MISTER BINGHAM REFUSED TO WHIP ME ANY MORE
HE COULD NOT BLAME HIS MOTHER FOR GOD KNOWS THAT SHE DID NOT WISH TO GIVE HIM LIFE HE MUST BLAME THE EDICTS OF THAT SOCIETY WHICH DEEMED IT NO CRIME TO UNDERMINE THE VIRTUE OF GIRLS IN MY THEN POSITION
DOES ANYONE IMAGINE THAT A WOMAN WOULD SUBMIT TO ABORTION IF NOT DENIED THE KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENTIFIC EFFECTIVE CONTRACEPTIVES
THE ACT MADE IT EXACTLY AS GREAT AN OFFENSE TO GIVE SUCH INFORMATION AS TO EXHIBIT THE SORT OF PICTURES AND WRITINGS AT WHICH THE LEGISLATION WAS OSTENSIBLY AIMED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE THE LATE ANTHONY COMSTOCK
THE SALARY WAS SMALL AND WE STILL HAD TO PRACTISE THE CLOSEST ECONOMY MISTER BINGHAM A HARD CRUEL MAN THE VILLAGE SCHOOLMASTER WAS A MEMBER OF MY YOUNG MASTER'S CHURCH AND HE WAS A FREQUENT VISITOR TO THE PARSONAGE
CONCERNING THE PREVENTING OF CONCEPTION ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DEATHS EACH YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY AND AN UNTOLD AMOUNT OF SICKNESS AND SORROW THE SUFFERING AND THE DEATH OF THESE WOMEN IS SQUARELY UPON THE HEADS OF THE LAWMAKERS AND THE PURITANICAL
I WAS TOO PROUD TO LET MY TORMENTOR KNOW WHAT I WAS SUFFERING
PAINFUL AND TOO OFTEN GRAVELY DANGEROUS OPERATION THOSE WOMEN IN WHOM THE FEMININE URGE TO FREEDOM IS STRONGEST CHOOSE THE ABORTIONIST ONE GROUP GOES ON BRINGING CHILDREN TO BIRTH HOPING THAT THEY WILL BE BORN DEAD OR DIE
DURING THIS TIME MY MASTER WAS UNUSUALLY KIND TO ME HE WAS NATURALLY A GOOD HEARTED MAN BUT WAS INFLUENCED BY HIS WIFE IT WAS SATURDAY EVENING AND WHILE I WAS BENDING OVER THE BED WATCHING THE BABY THAT I HAD JUST HUSHED INTO SLUMBER
IT CUT THE SKIN RAISED GREAT WELTS AND THE WARM BLOOD TRICKLED DOWN MY BACK OH GOD I CAN FEEL THE TORTURE NOW THE TERRIBLE EXCRUCIATING AGONY OF THOSE MOMENTS I DID NOT SCREAM
AND IN OPEN DEFIANCE OF THESE BRUTAL AND UNJUST LAWS ARE DEMANDING AMENDMENTS TO THE OBSCENITY STATUTES WHICH SHALL REMOVE INFORMATION CONCERNING CONTRACEPTIVES FROM ITS PRESENT CLASSIFICATION AMONG THINGS FILTHY AND OBSCENE
THE MOST RESPECTABLE ONE WAS ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AGO I WAS ASKED TO BE THE FIRST ATTENDANT BUT AS USUAL WITH ALL MY EXPECTATIONS I WAS DISAPPOINTED FOR ON THE WEDDING DAY I FELT MORE LIKE BEING LOCKED UP IN A THREE CORNERED BOX THAN ATTENDING A WEDDING
OVER HIS WORK WHICH GAVE HIM IMMENSE SATISFACTION IN THE MIDST OF HIS TOIL THERE WERE MOMENTS
ACCORDING TO WHAT THIS DOCTOR TELLS ME HE'S A VERY INTELLIGENT FELLOW
AND SEND MY SCYTHE PLEASE TO TIT FOR HIM TO SET IT AND BRING IT ROUND TOMORROW I SHALL MAYBE DO SOME MOWING MYSELF TOO HE SAID TRYING NOT TO BE EMBARRASSED THE BAILIFF SMILED AND SAID YES SIR
IT'S BOTH HE SAID RESOLUTELY I DON'T SEE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE WHAT WAS IT IMPOSSIBLE IF THE MONEY WERE PROPERLY LAID OUT TO PROVIDE MEDICAL AID IMPOSSIBLE AS IT SEEMS TO ME FOR THE THREE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF OUR DISTRICT
HE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH WHETHER IT WAS A HORSE OR THE BAILIFF ON HORSEBACK WHY IS IT YOU CAN DO NOTHING YOU MADE AN ATTEMPT AND DIDN'T SUCCEED AS YOU THINK AND YOU GIVE IN HOW CAN YOU HAVE SO LITTLE SELF RESPECT SELF RESPECT SAID LEVIN STUNG TO THE QUICK BY HIS BROTHER'S WORDS
POLLY'S BIG BUNDLE THE ROOM WAS VERY QUIET BUT PRESENTLY PHRONSIE STRAYED IN AND SEEING POLLY STUDYING CLIMBED UP IN A CHAIR BY THE WINDOW TO WATCH THE BIRDS HOP OVER THE VERANDA AND PICK UP WORMS IN THE GRASS BESIDE THE CARRIAGE DRIVE
NOTHING WELL I DID TRY YOU KNOW LEVIN SAID SLOWLY AND UNWILLINGLY I CAN'T AND SO THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT BUT WHY CAN'T YOU I MUST OWN I CAN'T MAKE IT OUT INDIFFERENCE INCAPACITY I WON'T ADMIT
THEY WERE TURNING THE PLOUGH OVER CAN THEY HAVE FINISHED PLOUGHING HE WONDERED COME REALLY THOUGH SAID THE ELDER BROTHER WITH A FROWN ON HIS HANDSOME CLEVER FACE THERE'S A LIMIT TO EVERYTHING IT'S VERY WELL TO BE ORIGINAL AND GENUINE AND TO DISLIKE EVERYTHING CONVENTIONAL
I'LL TRY NOT TO LET IT GO HE SAID TAKING HIS STAND BEHIND TIT AND WAITING FOR THE TIME TO BEGIN
GOING UP TO THE WINDOW SHE POINTED TRIUMPHANTLY TO THE LITTLE BIT OF BLUE SKY STILL VISIBLE THERE NOW SEE IT CAN'T RAIN YET AWHILE WELL SAID MISSUS PEPPER WHILE PHRONSIE STANDING IN A CHAIR WITH HER FACE PRESSED CLOSE TO THE CAGE WAS TELLING CHERRY THROUGH THE BARS
FOR INSTANCE TO LOOK LIKE A COPSE WHICH HAS GROWN UP OF ITSELF IN EUROPE AND I CAN'T GUSH OVER THESE BIRCH BRANCHES AND BELIEVE IN THEM SERGEY IVANOVITCH MERELY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AS THOUGH TO EXPRESS HIS WONDER HOW THE BIRCH BRANCHES HAD COME INTO THEIR ARGUMENT AT THAT POINT
I SIMPLY MEAN TO SAY THAT THOSE RIGHTS THAT TOUCH ME MY INTEREST I SHALL ALWAYS DEFEND TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
AND THE ROADS ARE NOT BETTER AND COULD NOT BE BETTER
I CAN UNDERSTAND COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE WHICH AFFECTS MY CHILDREN MY BROTHERS AND MYSELF I AM READY TO DELIBERATE ON WHAT CONCERNS ME BUT DELIBERATING ON HOW TO SPEND FORTY THOUSAND ROUBLES OF DISTRICT COUNCIL MONEY
EXCUSE ME BUT YOU KNOW ONE REALLY CAN'T ARGUE IN THAT WAY HE OBSERVED BUT KONSTANTIN LEVIN WANTED TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF FOR THE FAILING OF WHICH HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF LACK OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND HE WENT ON
HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING WISHED FOR NOTHING BUT NOT TO BE LEFT BEHIND THE PEASANTS AND TO DO HIS WORK AS WELL AS POSSIBLE
ANOTHER ROW AND YET ANOTHER ROW FOLLOWED LONG ROWS AND SHORT ROWS WITH GOOD GRASS AND WITH POOR GRASS LEVIN LOST ALL SENSE OF TIME AND COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHETHER IT WAS LATE OR EARLY NOW A CHANGE BEGAN TO COME
EVEN THE CUNNING BLANDISHMENTS OF A VERY ATTRACTIVE MONKEY THAT ALWAYS HAD ENTERTAINED THE CHILDREN ON THEIR NUMEROUS VISITS FAILED TO INTEREST HER NOW MAMSIE WOULD BE WORRYING SHE KNEW AND BESIDES THE SIGHT OF SO MANY BIRDS EATING THEIR SUPPERS OUT OF GENEROUSLY FULL SEED CUPS
AND AT THOSE SAME MOMENTS HIS ROW WAS ALMOST AS SMOOTH AND WELL CUT AS TIT'S BUT SO SOON AS HE RECOLLECTED WHAT HE WAS DOING AND BEGAN TRYING TO DO BETTER HE WAS AT ONCE CONSCIOUS OF ALL THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS TASK AND THE ROW WAS BADLY MOWN
AND WAS MAKING UP HIS MIND TO ASK TIT TO STOP BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT TIT STOPPED OF HIS OWN ACCORD AND STOOPING DOWN PICKED UP SOME GRASS RUBBED HIS SCYTHE AND BEGAN WHETTING IT LEVIN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF AND DRAWING A DEEP BREATH LOOKED ROUND
ONE LONGED TO THROW OFF THAT YOKE THAT CRUSHED US ALL DECENT PEOPLE AMONG US BUT TO BE A TOWN COUNCILOR AND DISCUSS HOW MANY DUSTMEN ARE NEEDED AND HOW CHIMNEYS SHALL BE CONSTRUCTED IN THE TOWN IN WHICH I DON'T LIVE TO SERVE ON A JURY AND TRY A PEASANT WHO'S STOLEN A FLITCH OF BACON
BUT I STILL DO NOT ADMIT THIS MOVEMENT TO BE JUST SAID KONSTANTIN LEVIN REDDENING A LITTLE WHAT BUT YOU SAID JUST NOW THAT'S TO SAY I DON'T ADMIT IT'S BEING EITHER GOOD OR POSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN'T TELL WITHOUT MAKING THE TRIAL
TO SEND YOU A BOTTLE OF LAFITTE AND ROAST TURKEY OUT THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE AWKWARD NO I'LL SIMPLY COME HOME AT THE TIME OF THEIR NOONDAY REST
FOR EVERY THREE ACRES TO DRIVE INTO THE TOWN SLEEP WITH BUGS AND LISTEN TO ALL SORTS OF IDIOCY AND LOATHSOMENESS AND SELF INTEREST OFFERS ME NO INDUCEMENT EXCUSE ME SERGEY IVANOVITCH INTERPOSED WITH A SMILE
AND A GENTLEMAN'S VOICE SAID IN THE DEEPEST CONCERN I BEG YOUR PARDON IT WAS EXTREMELY CARELESS IN ME IT'S NO MATTER SAID POLLY HOPPING UP WITH A LITTLE LAUGH AND STRAIGHTENING HER HAT ONLY AND SHE BEGAN TO LOOK FOR HER PARCEL THAT HAD BEEN SENT SPINNING
WITH ITS GRAYISH RIDGES OF CUT GRASS AND THE BLACK HEAPS OF COATS TAKEN OFF BY THE MOWERS AT THE PLACE FROM WHICH THEY HAD STARTED CUTTING GRADUALLY AS HE RODE TOWARDS THE MEADOW THE PEASANTS CAME INTO SIGHT SOME IN COATS SOME IN THEIR SHIRTS MOWING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IF THEY'D TOLD ME AT COLLEGE THAT OTHER PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS AND I DIDN'T THEN PRIDE WOULD HAVE COME IN BUT IN THIS CASE ONE WANTS FIRST TO BE CONVINCED THAT ONE HAS CERTAIN QUALIFICATIONS FOR THIS SORT OF BUSINESS
AND ALTOGETHER GOT SO VERY WELL ACQUAINTED THAT BY THE TIME THEY TURNED IN AT THE OLD STONE GATEWAY SHE FELT AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS AND THERE THE FIRST THING THEY EITHER OF THEM SAW
WELL HE MUST HAVE SOMETHING RIGHT AWAY SAID MISSUS PEPPER DECIDEDLY THAT'S CERTAIN I'LL RUN RIGHT DOWN TO FLETCHER'S AND GET IT CRIED POLLY TWON'T TAKE ME BUT A MINUTE MAMSIE JASPER'S GONE AND THOMAS TOO SO I'VE GOT TO GO SHE ADDED AS SHE SAW HER MOTHER HESITATE
AND THERE'S A FIVE CENT PIECE IN THAT ONE FOR YOU TO RIDE UP WITH SAID HER MOTHER TYING UP THE PURSE CAREFULLY REMEMBER FOR YOU TO RIDE UP WITH WELL I GUESS YOU BETTER RIDE UP ANYWAY POLLY COME TO THINK AND THEN YOU'LL GET HOME ALL THE QUICKER WHERE YOU GOING ASKED PHRONSIE
AND TWO OR THREE OTHER THINGS THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH BIRDS AT ALL AND THEN THEY CAME OUT ON THE WET SLIPPERY STREET AGAIN NOW THEN LITTLE GIRL SAID THE GENTLEMAN TUCKING THE BUNDLE UNDER HIS ARM AND OPENING THE UMBRELLA THEN HE TOOK HOLD OF POLLY'S HAND WHO BY THIS TIME WAS GLAD OF A PROTECTOR WHERE DO YOU LIVE
COMMENCING TO START OFF BRISKLY AND GRASPING HER HAND TIGHTER NOW THEN POLLY SO OFF THEY WENT AT A VERY FAST PACE SHE SKIPPING THROUGH THE PUDDLES THAT HIS LONG EVEN STRIDES CARRIED HIM SAFELY OVER CHATTERED AWAY BY HIS SIDE UNDER THE UMBRELLA AND ANSWERED HIS MANY QUESTIONS
IT'S SPLENDID AS EXERCISE ONLY YOU'LL HARDLY BE ABLE TO STAND IT SAID SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITHOUT A SHADE OF IRONY I'VE TRIED IT IT'S HARD WORK AT FIRST BUT YOU GET INTO IT I DARE SAY I SHALL MANAGE TO KEEP IT UP REALLY WHAT AN IDEA BUT TELL ME
I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND I CAN'T DO IT KONSTANTIN LEVIN SPOKE AS THOUGH THE FLOODGATES OF HIS SPEECH HAD BURST OPEN SERGEY IVANOVITCH SMILED BUT TOMORROW IT'LL BE YOUR TURN TO BE TRIED WOULD IT HAVE SUITED YOUR TASTES BETTER TO BE TRIED IN THE OLD CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL
AND THEN SHE TOLD HIM HOW SHE'D FORGOTTEN CHERRY'S SEED AND ALL ABOUT IT AND OH SIR SHE SAID AND HER VOICE BEGAN TO TREMBLE MAMSIE'LL BE SO FRIGHTENED IF I DON'T GET THERE SOON I'M GOING UP THERE MYSELF
IT'S NOT RIGHT FOR YOU NOT TO GO TO THE MEETINGS AND ALTOGETHER TO KEEP OUT OF THE DISTRICT BUSINESS IF DECENT PEOPLE WON'T GO INTO IT OF COURSE IT'S BOUND TO GO ALL WRONG WE PAY THE MONEY AND IT ALL GOES IN SALARIES AND THERE ARE NO SCHOOLS NOR DISTRICT NURSES NOR MIDWIVES NOR DRUGSTORES
SELF INTEREST DID NOT INDUCE US TO WORK FOR THE EMANCIPATION OF THE SERFS BUT WE DID WORK FOR IT NO KONSTANTIN LEVIN BROKE IN WITH STILL GREATER HEAT THE EMANCIPATION OF THE SERFS WAS A DIFFERENT MATTER THERE SELF INTEREST DID COME IN
AND SHOWED HIM ALL THE INCORRECTNESS OF HIS VIEW AS FOR YOUR DISLIKE OF IT EXCUSE MY SAYING SO THAT'S SIMPLY OUR RUSSIAN SLOTH AND OLD SERF OWNER'S WAYS AND I'M CONVINCED THAT IN YOU IT'S A TEMPORARY ERROR AND WILL PASS KONSTANTIN WAS SILENT
AND DRENCHED HIS BACK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SOAKED IN WATER HE FELT VERY HAPPY WHAT DELIGHTED HIM PARTICULARLY WAS THAT NOW HE KNEW HE WOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD OUT HIS PLEASURE WAS ONLY DISTURBED BY HIS ROW NOT BEING WELL CUT
IF IT IS NOT FOUNDED ON SELF INTEREST THAT'S A UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE A PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLE HE SAID REPEATING THE WORD PHILOSOPHICAL WITH DETERMINATION AS THOUGH WISHING TO SHOW THAT HE HAD AS MUCH RIGHT AS ANY ONE ELSE TO TALK OF PHILOSOPHY
NOW PHRONSIE YOU AND I OUGHT TO TAKE CARE OF CHERRY POOR THING AT THIS PHRONSIE TURNED AND WIPED AWAY TWO BIG TEARS WHILE SHE GAZED UP AT THE CAGE IN EXTREME COMMISERATION I GUESS I'LL GIVE HIM A PIECE OF BREAD SAID MISSUS PEPPER TO HERSELF AT THIS WORD BREAD
AND WHY DOESN'T HE GO BACK THOUGHT LEVIN NOT GUESSING THAT THE PEASANTS HAD BEEN MOWING NO LESS THAN FOUR HOURS WITHOUT STOPPING AND IT WAS TIME FOR THEIR LUNCH LUNCH SIR SAID THE OLD MAN IS IT REALLY TIME
AT TEA THE SAME EVENING LEVIN SAID TO HIS BROTHER I FANCY THE FINE WEATHER WILL LAST TOMORROW I SHALL START MOWING I'M SO FOND OF THAT FORM OF FIELD LABOR SAID SERGEY IVANOVITCH I'M AWFULLY FOND OF IT
THE FIRST ROW AS LEVIN NOTICED TIT HAD MOWED SPECIALLY QUICKLY PROBABLY WISHING TO PUT HIS MASTER TO THE TEST AND THE ROW HAPPENED TO BE A LONG ONE THE NEXT ROWS WERE EASIER BUT STILL LEVIN HAD TO STRAIN EVERY NERVE NOT TO DROP BEHIND THE PEASANTS
HOW COULD I CRIED POLLY IN ACCENTS OF DESPAIR NOT HEEDING HER MOTHER'S QUESTION OH MAMSIE WILL HE DIE DO YOU THINK I GUESS NOT SAID MISSUS PEPPER LAYING DOWN HER WORK AND COMING UP TO THE CAGE WHILE PHRONSIE SCRAMBLED OFF FROM HER CHAIR AND HURRIED TO THE SCENE WHY HE DOES ACT QUEER DON'T HE
WHAT IS IT SAID THE GENTLEMAN BENDING DOWN AND BEGINNING TO EXPLORE TOO IN THE DARKNESS MY BUNDLE BEGAN POLLY OH DEAR NO NEED TO ASK FOR IT NOW THERE LAY THE PAPER WET AND TORN DOWN AT THEIR FEET THE SEED LAY ALL OVER THE PAVEMENT SCATTERED FAR AND WIDE EVEN OUT TO THE PUDDLES IN THE STREET
THE MOMENT CAME WHEN HE FELT HE HAD NO STRENGTH LEFT BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT TIT STOPPED AND WHETTED THE SCYTHES SO THEY MOWED THE FIRST ROW
AND ESPECIALLY THAT ALL THIS BUSINESS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY IT'S NOT OF IMPORTANCE SAID SERGEY IVANOVITCH STUNG TO THE QUICK TOO AT HIS BROTHER'S CONSIDERING ANYTHING OF NO IMPORTANCE THAT INTERESTED HIM
THEN I'LL BE ALL RIGHT SO SHE WENT ON WITH NIMBLE FOOTSTEPS DODGING THE CROWD AND SOON CAME TO THE CORNER A CAR WAS JUST IN SIGHT THAT WAS FINE
KONSTANTIN LEVIN HAD WARMED TO HIS SUBJECT AND BEGAN MIMICKING THE PRESIDENT AND THE HALF WITTED ALIOSHKA IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT WAS ALL TO THE POINT
AND FLEW UP TO THE CAGE AND BEGAN TO WILDLY GESTICULATE AND EXPLAIN AND SHOWER DOWN ON HIM EVERY ENDEARING NAME SHE COULD THINK OF WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED HER MOTHER TURNING AROUND IN HER CHAIR IN PERFECT ASTONISHMENT WHAT UPON EARTH POLLY
THERE ISN'T ANY MAMSIE IN THE HOUSE SHE STAMMERED HE HAD THE LAST YESTERDAY AND YOU FORGOT HIM TO DAY ASKED MISSUS PEPPER WITH A LOOK IN HER BLACK EYES POLLY DIDN'T LIKE YES'M SAID POOR POLLY IN A LOW VOICE
AFTER THE IRRITATING DISCUSSION WITH HIS BROTHER HE PONDERED OVER THIS INTENTION AGAIN I MUST HAVE PHYSICAL EXERCISE OR MY TEMPER'LL CERTAINLY BE RUINED HE THOUGHT AND HE DETERMINED HE WOULD GO MOWING HOWEVER AWKWARD HE MIGHT FEEL ABOUT IT WITH HIS BROTHER OR THE PEASANTS
SHOWING JUST HOW CLEAR AND BROWN THE EYES WERE THERE'S PERCY AND VAN AND LITTLE DICK OH HE'S SO CUNNING SHE CRIED IMPULSIVELY THE GENTLEMAN'S FACE LOOKED VERY QUEER JUST THEN BUT HE MERELY SAID WHY YOU MUST BE POLLY
ONLY FILLED HER HEART WITH REMORSE AS SHE THOUGHT OF POOR CHERRY AND HIS EMPTY ONE SO SHE PUT DOWN HER TEN CENTS SILENTLY ON THE COUNTER AND TOOK UP THE LITTLE PACKAGE OF SEED AND WENT OUT BUT WHAT A CHANGE
TO WHICH EVEN THE PEASANTS DON'T WANT TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN AND TO WHICH I'VE NO VERY FIRM FAITH THAT THEY OUGHT TO SEND THEM SAID HE
WHO ON SEEING THE PURSE KNEW THERE WAS SOME EXPEDITION ON FOOT AND BEGINNING TO CLAMBER DOWN OUT OF THE CHAIR OH I WANT TO GO TOO I DO TAKE ME POLLY OH NO PET I CAN'T CRIED POLLY I'VE GOT TO HURRY LIKE EVERYTHING
AND SO HE GOT HOT AND UNCONSCIOUSLY BLURTED OUT THE CHIEF CAUSE OF HIS INDIFFERENCE TO PUBLIC BUSINESS PERHAPS IT MAY ALL BE VERY GOOD BUT WHY SHOULD I WORRY MYSELF ABOUT ESTABLISHING DISPENSARIES WHICH I SHALL NEVER MAKE USE OF AND SCHOOLS TO WHICH I SHALL NEVER SEND MY CHILDREN
TOWARDS EVENING KONSTANTIN LEVIN WENT TO HIS COUNTING HOUSE GAVE DIRECTIONS AS TO THE WORK TO BE DONE AND SENT ABOUT THE VILLAGE TO SUMMON THE MOWERS FOR THE MORROW TO CUT THE HAY IN KALINOV MEADOW THE LARGEST AND BEST OF HIS GRASS LANDS
AND THE REBEL YELLS WERE COMING OUT OF THE WOODS AND SHOUTED OFFICERS TO THE REAR OFFICERS TO THE REAR THEN EVERY OFFICER GETS BEHIND THE LINE OF PRIVATE SOLDIERS AND THE HIGHER THE OFFICER'S RANK THE FARTHER BEHIND HE GOES
HE MUST HAVE STUDIED THE SUBJECT A GREAT DEAL WHEN YOU COME TO THINK OF IT BECAUSE HE ASSUMED AN ELOCUTIONARY ATTITUDE HE RESTED HEAVILY UPON HIS LEFT HEEL
THY HOLY TEMPLE HAVE THEY DEFILED THEY HAVE LAID JERUSALEM ON HEAPS THE BLOOD OF THY SERVANTS HAVE THEY SHED LIKE WATER ROUND ABOUT JERUSALEM AND THERE WAS NONE TO BURY THEM
TRUE GREATNESS IS OFTEN UNRECOGNIZED THAT IS SURE
HE WENT TO BOSTON AND APPLIED FOR HIS PATENT AND EVERY ONE OF YOU THAT HAS A RUBBER TIPPED PENCIL IN YOUR POCKET IS NOW PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE MILLIONAIRE NO CAPITAL NOT A PENNY DID HE INVEST IN IT
SCRAWLED ALL OVER WITH THE HORRIBLE FIGURES OF HEATHEN GODS AS TO DAY WE READ IN THE CLEAN WHITE PAGES OF OUR BIBLE LET US REMEMBER THIS SCENE AND OF THE TIME WHEN THOSE TORN AND BLOOD STAINED FRAGMENTS WERE
HAD NEVER LISTENED TO THE CUNNING TEMPTATIONS OF THE HEATHEN GREEKS
THAT IF YOU ONLY GET THE PRIVILEGE OF CASTING ONE VOTE YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING THAT IS WORTH WHILE UNLESS YOU CAN CONTROL MORE THAN ONE VOTE YOU WILL BE UNKNOWN AND YOUR INFLUENCE SO DISSIPATED AS PRACTICALLY NOT TO BE FELT
AND DID NOT LOOK UP AT ME AND I SAT THERE TREMBLING FINALLY WHEN HE HAD PUT THE STRING AROUND HIS PAPERS HE PUSHED THEM OVER TO ONE SIDE
BUT IN SPITE OF ALL MANY JEWISH MEN AND WOMEN REMAINED FAITHFUL TO GOD THEY KEPT HIS LAWS AND READ IN HIS BOOK DAILY LOOKING ALWAYS FOR THE COMING SAVIOUR THE MESSIAH WHO WOULD RULE AND REDEEM HIS PEOPLE
THEN CAME BACK TO THE DOOR AND MOTIONED FOR ME I WENT UP TO THAT ANTEROOM AND THE SECRETARY SAID
HIS SHINING HIS SHINING SWORD FLASHING FLASHING IN THE SUNLIGHT AS HE SHOUTED TO HIS TROOPS COME ON OH DEAR DEAR DEAR HOW LITTLE THAT GOOD MAN KNEW ABOUT WAR
AS SOME SAY BEFORE THE KING HIMSELF FOR REFUSING TO BREAK THE LAWS OF GOD THEY WERE CRUELLY BEATEN BUT ONE OF THEM CRIED WHAT WOULDST THOU ASK OF US WE ARE READY TO DIE
NEW YORK SAINT LOUIS AND SAN FRANCISCO DO
YET IN THE GOOD MAN'S SPEECH THEY WERE SCARCELY KNOWN HE DID REFER TO THEM BUT ONLY INCIDENTALLY THE HERO OF THE HOUR WAS THIS BOY DID THE NATION OWE HIM ANYTHING NO
ALL THAT REMAINED TO THE WORLD BUT THANK GOD WHEN ALL THE PIECES HAD BEEN COLLECTED TOGETHER THERE WAS PLENTY OF MATERIAL FROM WHICH TO MAKE FRESH COPIES AND NO SOONER HAD PEACE BEEN RESTORED TO THE CITY
BUT THOUGH THEIR FACES GREW PALE AS DEATH AND THEY QUIVERED WITH ANGUISH TO SEE THEIR LOVED ONE SUFFER THEY GAZED STEADFASTLY AT EACH OTHER THE LORD LOOKETH UPON US THE LORD GOD HATH COMFORT IN US THEY SAID
HE HAD NEVER MADE A SPEECH IN HIS LIFE BUT HE FELL INTO THE SAME ERROR THAT HUNDREDS OF OTHER MEN HAVE FALLEN INTO IT SEEMS SO STRANGE THAT A MAN WON'T LEARN HE MUST SPEAK HIS PIECE AS A BOY
WHEN I HAD GOT SEATED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SELECTMEN AROSE AND CAME FORWARD TO THE TABLE AND WE ALL SUPPOSED HE WOULD INTRODUCE THE CONGREGATIONAL MINISTER WHO WAS THE ONLY ORATOR IN TOWN AND THAT HE WOULD GIVE THE ORATION TO THE RETURNING SOLDIERS
IF HE IN TENDS TO BE AN ORATOR WHEN HE IS GROWN
TO BE GREAT AT ALL ONE MUST BE GREAT HERE NOW IN PHILADELPHIA HE WHO CAN GIVE TO THIS CITY BETTER STREETS AND BETTER SIDEWALKS BETTER SCHOOLS AND MORE COLLEGES
WHATSOEVER HE HAD TO DO AT ALL HE PUT HIS WHOLE MIND INTO IT AND HELD IT ALL THERE UNTIL THAT WAS ALL DONE THAT MAKES MEN GREAT ALMOST ANYWHERE
WHY WAS HE THE HERO SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT MAN FELL INTO THAT SAME HUMAN ERROR THAT THIS BOY WAS GREAT BECAUSE HE WAS AN OFFICER AND THESE WERE ONLY PRIVATE SOLDIERS
WE ARE WE ARE VERY HAPPY WE ARE VERY HAPPY WE ARE VERY HAPPY
WHEN THEY HAD THE SECOND FUNERAL I WAS INVITED AMONG OTHERS AND WENT OUT TO SEE THAT SAME COFFIN PUT BACK IN THE TOMB AT SPRINGFIELD AROUND THE TOMB STOOD LINCOLN'S OLD NEIGHBORS TO WHOM HE WAS JUST OLD ABE
LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH HORRIBLE AS IT SEEMS ALL THESE WICKED COMMANDS WERE CARRIED OUT A SOW WAS SLAUGHTERED ON THE ALTAR AND AN IMAGE OF JUPITER SET UP IN GOD'S HOLY TEMPLE MORE CRUEL THAN ALL
I NEVER WAS SO TAKEN ABACK FRIENDS IN ALL MY LIFE NEVER
SACRIFICE AS ALL JEWS SHALL BE FORCED TO DO OR DIE BUT THE OLD MAN LOOKED THE GREEK STRAIGHT IN THE FACE
HE WAS A MAN WHO HAD NEVER HELD OFFICE BEFORE BUT HE WAS A GOOD MAN AND HIS FRIENDS HAVE TOLD ME THAT I MIGHT USE THIS WITHOUT GIVING THEM OFFENSE HE WAS A GOOD MAN BUT HE THOUGHT AN OFFICE MADE A MAN GREAT
WHY DOES NEW YORK EXCEL PHILADELPHIA PEOPLE SAY BECAUSE OF HER HARBOR WHY DO MANY OTHER CITIES OF THE UNITED STATES GET AHEAD OF PHILADELPHIA NOW
THERE I WAS IN THE HALLWAY
WHEN WHEN THERE COMES A GREAT WAR WHEN WE GET INTO DIFFICULTY THROUGH WATCHFUL WAITING IN MEXICO WHEN WE
SLIGHTLY ADVANCED THE RIGHT FOOT OPENED THE ORGANS OF SPEECH AND ADVANCED HIS RIGHT FOOT AT AN ANGLE OF FORTY FIVE AS HE STOOD IN THAT ELOCUTIONARY ATTITUDE FRIENDS
BUT HIS PEOPLE COULD STILL CRY TO THE LORD AND HE HEARD
IF YOU HAVE EVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A KING OR QUEEN YOU GO AND BE RECEIVED BY THE MAYOR
THIS ARMY OF GOD'S PEOPLE DROVE THE HEATHEN FROM THE CITIES OF JUDAH HOW THEY OVERTURNED THE HEATHEN ALTARS AND CAST DOWN THE IMAGES OF THE FALSE GODS
HE ADJUSTED HIS SPECTACLES AND LEANED OVER IT FOR A MOMENT AND MARCHED BACK ON THAT PLATFORM AND THEN CAME FORWARD LIKE THIS TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP
THEY BEGAN GREATLY TO ADMIRE THE GREEKS THEMSELVES AND TO TAKE THEIR OPINION ABOUT MANY THINGS WHO CAN BUILD LIKE THESE GREEKS THEY WILL HAVE SAID WHO CAN CARVE SUCH BEAUTIFUL STATUES OR PAINT SUCH BEAUTIFUL PICTURES
FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS I SHUT MY EYES SHUT THEM CLOSE AND LO I SEE THE FACES OF MY YOUTH
THAT IS THE ONLY GREAT WRONG THAT I CAN LAY AT THE FEET OF THE MAGNIFICENT PHILADELPHIA THAT HAS BEEN SO UNIVERSALLY KIND TO ME
WE ARE
IT IS GOVERNED BY INFLUENCE IT IS GOVERNED BY THE AMBITIONS AND THE ENTERPRISES WHICH CONTROL VOTES
IF WE ARE TO HAVE A BOULEVARD TALK IT DOWN IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE BETTER SCHOOLS TALK THEM DOWN IF YOU WISH TO HAVE WISE LEGISLATION TALK IT DOWN TALK ALL THE PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS DOWN
INTERFERED WITH THEIR RELIGION NOR TOOK TREASURE FROM THEIR TEMPLE YET WHILE ALEXANDER DID GOD'S PEOPLE NO OUTWARD INJURY HIS INFLUENCE AND EXAMPLE LED THEM ASTRAY FOR ALEXANDER WAS A GREEK AND THE GREEKS
I HAVE COME NOW TO THE APEX OF MY THOUGHT I HAVE COME NOW TO THE HEART OF THE WHOLE MATTER AND TO THE CENTER OF MY STRUGGLE WHY ISN'T PHILADELPHIA A GREATER CITY IN ITS GREATER WEALTH
MANY FOLLOWED HIM AT ONCE OTHERS JOINED HIM LATER IN THE STRONG CAMP HE FORMED IN THE MOUNTAINS UNTIL AT LAST HE WAS AT THE HEAD OF AN ARMY WONDERFUL IT IS TO READ HOW LITTLE BY LITTLE
WE ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED TO SEE WITH US TO DAY THIS YOUNG HERO THAT MEANT ME THIS YOUNG HERO WHO IN IMAGINATION FRIENDS REMEMBER HE SAID THAT IF HE HAD NOT SAID IN IMAGINATION
HOW ARE YOU SAM OR GOOD MORNING JIM OF COURSE YOU WOULD THAT IS JUST WHAT YOU WOULD DO
OFTEN ALAS DRENCHED WITH THE LIFE BLOOD OF THOSE WHO LOVED THEM NOW INDEED THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE WERE IN TERRIBLE DANGER FOR THE MOST POWERFUL KING OF THE FIERCE HEATHEN WORLD WAS FIGHTING DIRECTLY AGAINST THEM O GOD
WHILE HOBSON AS AN OFFICER MIGHT REASONABLY BE BEHIND THE SMOKE STACK YOU HAVE GATHERED IN THIS HOUSE YOUR MOST INTELLIGENT PEOPLE AND YET PERHAPS NOT ONE HERE
SOME OF YOU SAW THE PROCESSION GO UP BROAD STREET I WAS AWAY BUT THE FAMILY WROTE TO ME THAT THE TALLY HO COACH WITH LIEUTENANT HOBSON UPON IT
THE SAFETY PIN AND OUT OF THAT SAFETY PIN MADE THE FORTUNE OF ONE OF THE GREAT ARISTOCRATIC FAMILIES OF THIS NATION
I WENT INTO THE WAITING ROOM AND SAT DOWN WITH A LOT OF OTHERS ON THE BENCHES AND THE SECRETARY ASKED ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO TELL HIM WHAT THEY WANTED AFTER THE SECRETARY HAD BEEN THROUGH THE LINE HE WENT IN AND
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE GREAT
TURNED DOWN INTO THE TOWN HALL THEN THEY SEATED MY SOLDIERS DOWN THE CENTER AISLE AND I SAT DOWN ON THE FRONT SEAT A GREAT ASSEMBLY OF PEOPLE A HUNDRED OR TWO CAME IN TO FILL THE TOWN HALL SO THAT THEY STOOD UP ALL AROUND
NOT A GREAT INVENTOR OR GENIUS
THE TOWN MAYOR WAS THEN THE EMPEROR THE KING OF OUR DAY AND OUR TIME
EVER IN TIME OF DANGER TO GO AHEAD OF HIS MEN
THIS NATION WHERE THE PEOPLE RULE IS GOVERNED BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE AND SO LONG AS IT IS THEN THE OFFICE HOLDER IS BUT
I WENT OUT TO WRITE THE LIFE OF GENERAL GARFIELD AND A NEIGHBOR
MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME WHEN I TOOK THAT STICK AND PUT THE RUBBER ON THE END THAT THERE WAS A PATENT AND THAT WAS THE FIRST THOUGHT OF THAT
AND COME BACK AGAIN TO THEIR NATIVE TOWN WE ARE ESPECIALLY WE ARE ESPECIALLY
WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE CASTLE BUT THIS WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF SORROWS SOON THE DREADFUL ORDERS OF THE HEATHEN KING WERE CRIED THROUGH THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM
AND WHAT WAS WORSE THEY PUT GREEK BOOKS INTO THEIR HANDS INSTEAD OF THE BIBLE SLOWLY BUT SURELY THIS UNHOLY LEAVEN ENTERED THE PEOPLE'S LIFE AND INFLUENCED THEIR THOUGHTS
THIS YOUNG HERO WHO IN IMAGINATION WE HAVE SEEN LEADING WE HAVE SEEN LEADING LEADING WE HAVE SEEN LEADING HIS TROOPS ON TO THE DEADLY BREACH WE HAVE SEEN HIS SHINING
WE DON'T HAVE ANY GREAT MEN IN PHILADELPHIA THEY DON'T LIVE HERE THEY LIVE AWAY OFF IN ROME OR SAINT PETERSBURG OR LONDON OR MANAYUNK OR ANYWHERE ELSE BUT HERE IN OUR TOWN
ALL WAS INCOME ALL THE WAY UP INTO THE MILLIONS BUT LET ME HASTEN TO ONE OTHER GREATER THOUGHT SHOW ME THE GREAT MEN AND WOMEN WHO LIVE IN PHILADELPHIA A GENTLEMAN OVER THERE WILL GET UP AND SAY
THEY WILL BE EASY ENOUGH TO MANAGE SO HE SENT ONE OF HIS GENERALS TO JERUSALEM AND BADE HIM TAKE AN ARMY OF SOLDIERS AND SPEAK PEACEABLE WORDS UNTO THEM
STAINS OF HEATHEN SACRIFICES THEN TENDERLY AND REVERENTLY THEY GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THE COPIES OF THEIR SCRIPTURES WEEPING AS THEY SAW THE POOR FRAGMENTS BLACKENED WITH FIRE STAINED WITH BLOOD AND
THEN TAD AND I ARE GOING OUT TO SPRINGFIELD ILLINOIS I HAVE BOUGHT A FARM OUT THERE AND
AND HAD BROUGHT UP HIS SONS TO FOLLOW IN HIS STEPS WHEN MATTATHIAS AND HIS SONS HEARD WHAT WAS BEING DONE AT JERUSALEM THEY CLOTHED THEMSELVES IN SACKCLOTH AND WEPT PRAYING AND FASTING CONTINUALLY BESEECHING GOD TO FORGIVE HIS PEOPLE
HE WAS SO FAMILIAR SO
THE SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE AND THE BIBLE SAYS THE SERVANT CANNOT BE GREATER THAN THE MASTER THE BIBLE SAYS HE THAT IS SENT
SOME OF THEM HAD GONE TO DEATH
EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT THEIR POETRY IS THE FINEST IN THE WORLD AND THAT THEIR BOOKS ARE THE WISEST AND PLEASANTEST TO READ AND THEN HOW WELL THEY TRAIN THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE
THEN HE GATHERED HIMSELF UP WITH CLENCHED FISTS AND CAME BACK
AND TO PUT AWAY THEIR SINS IN A LITTLE WHILE THE KING'S OFFICERS CAME TO THE HEATHEN ALTAR AT MODIN THE TOWN WHERE THE OLD PRIEST LIVED SACRIFICE TO JUPITER OUR MASTER'S GOD THEY SAID
INATTENTION TO PROPER NAMES WAS AN
IF THE MUSCLES OF THE THROAT ARE CONSTRICTED THE TONE PASSAGE PARTIALLY CLOSED AND THE MOUTH KEPT HALF SHUT HOW CAN YOU EXPECT THE TONE TO COME OUT BRIGHT AND CLEAR OR EVEN TO COME OUT AT ALL SOUND IS A SERIES OF WAVES AND IF YOU MAKE A PRISON OF YOUR MOUTH
WILL NOT ONLY HARM ITS TONES BUT INJURE ITS HEALTH NERVOUSNESS AND MENTAL STRAIN ARE COMMON SOURCES OF MOUTH AND THROAT CONSTRICTION SO MAKE THE BATTLE FOR POISE AND SELF CONFIDENCE FOR WHICH WE PLEADED IN THE OPENING CHAPTER
AND THEN IT SEEMS THAT THEY CUT YOUR FLESH WITH THE SCISSORS THAT IS FRIGHTFUL I HAVE CRIED TILL I HAVE NO EYES LEFT IT IS QUEER THAT A PERSON CAN SUFFER LIKE THAT YOUR GRANDFATHER HAS A VERY KINDLY AIR DON'T DISTURB YOURSELF DON'T RISE ON YOUR ELBOW
A AS IN MAY E AS IN MET U AS IN USE A
DO NOT FORCE YOUR HEAD AROUND SIMPLY RELAX YOUR NECK AND LET GRAVITY PULL IT AROUND AS YOUR BODY MOVES AGAIN LET YOUR HEAD FALL FORWARD ON YOUR BREAST RAISE YOUR HEAD LETTING YOUR JAW HANG RELAX UNTIL YOUR JAW FEELS HEAVY
HOLDING THE JAWS AND LIPS RIGIDLY IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE TONE TO SQUEEZE THROUGH
AND WITHOUT READING IT THROUGH SENT IT OFF BY A SPECIAL MESSENGER THE NEXT MORNING SHE RECEIVED HIS LETTER AND REGRETTED HER OWN SHE DREADED A REPETITION OF THE SEVERE LOOK HE HAD FLUNG AT HER AT PARTING ESPECIALLY WHEN HE KNEW THAT THE BABY WAS NOT DANGEROUSLY ILL
IT WOULD KILL OUR GREATEST JOY THE DELIGHT OF ACQUISITION IF PUBLIC SPEAKING MEANS TO YOU A FULLER LIFE YOU WILL KNOW NO GREATER HAPPINESS THAN A WELL SPOKEN SPEECH
NOT SO THE FLOWING QUALITY OF SPEECH IS MUCH MORE FOR IT IS A COMPOSITE EFFECT WITH EACH OF ITS PRIOR CONDITIONS DESERVING OF CAREFUL NOTICE THE SOURCES OF FLUENCY
LONGFELLOW SAID A SINGLE CONVERSATION ACROSS THE TABLE WITH A WISE MAN IS BETTER THAN TEN YEARS STUDY OF BOOKS AND HOLMES WHIMSICALLY YET NONE THE LESS TRUTHFULLY DECLARED THAT HALF THE TIME HE TALKED TO FIND OUT WHAT HE THOUGHT BUT THAT METHOD MUST NOT BE APPLIED ON THE PLATFORM
THE EVENING WAS SPENT HAPPILY AND GAILY IN THE PRESENCE OF PRINCESS VARVARA WHO COMPLAINED TO HIM THAT ANNA HAD BEEN TAKING MORPHINE IN HIS ABSENCE WHAT AM I TO DO I COULDN'T SLEEP MY THOUGHTS PREVENTED ME
AND RESOLVED TO DO ALL SHE COULD TO CONTROL HERSELF SO AS TO BEAR THE PARTING WITH COMPOSURE BUT THE COLD SEVERE GLANCE WITH WHICH HE HAD LOOKED AT HER WHEN HE CAME TO TELL HER HE WAS GOING HAD WOUNDED HER AND BEFORE HE HAD STARTED
REMEMBER TO APPLY THE PRINCIPLES OF EASE OPENNESS AND FORWARDNESS THEY ARE THE PRIME FACTORS IN ENABLING YOUR VOICE TO BE HEARD AT A DISTANCE DO NOT GAZE AT THE FLOOR AS YOU TALK THIS HABIT NOT ONLY GIVES THE SPEAKER AN AMATEURISH APPEARANCE
LET IT GO DON'T WORK LET THE YOKE OF SPEECH BE EASY AND ITS BURDEN LIGHT YOUR THROAT SHOULD BE FREE FROM STRAIN DURING SPEECH
HER PEACE OF MIND WAS DESTROYED IN SOLITUDE AFTERWARDS THINKING OVER THAT GLANCE WHICH HAD EXPRESSED HIS RIGHT TO FREEDOM SHE CAME AS SHE ALWAYS DID TO THE SAME POINT THE SENSE OF HER OWN HUMILIATION
SHE WAS BORN A MARQUISE WHAT EYELASHES SHE HAS GET IT WELL FIXED IN YOUR NODDLES MY CHILDREN THAT YOU ARE IN THE TRUE ROAD LOVE EACH OTHER BE FOOLISH ABOUT IT LOVE IS THE FOLLY OF MEN AND THE WIT OF GOD ADORE EACH OTHER
YOU CAN TELL WHETHER YOU ARE PLACING YOUR TONE FORWARD OR NOT BY INHALING A DEEP BREATH AND SINGING AH WITH THE MOUTH WIDE OPEN TRYING TO FEEL THE LITTLE DELICATE SOUND WAVES STRIKE THE BONY ARCH OF THE MOUTH JUST ABOVE THE FRONT TEETH
OPEN YOUR MOUTH WIDE RELAX ALL THE ORGANS OF SPEECH AND LET THE TONE FLOW OUT EASILY START TO YAWN BUT INSTEAD OF YAWNING SPEAK WHILE YOUR THROAT IS OPEN MAKE THIS OPEN FEELING HABITUAL WHEN SPEAKING
FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR ONE MIGHT AS WELL SAY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AS FOR MARIUS AND COSETTE THEY WERE GAZING AT EACH OTHER WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON THEY HARDLY HEEDED THIS DETAIL
SHE RAN JOYFULLY TO MEET HIM WELL HOW IS ANNIE HE SAID TIMIDLY FROM BELOW LOOKING UP TO ANNA AS SHE RAN DOWN TO HIM HE WAS SITTING ON A CHAIR AND A FOOTMAN WAS PULLING OFF HIS WARM OVER BOOT
AS YOU CAN EASILY DEMONSTRATE BY HOLDING YOUR NOSE AS YOU TALK IF YOU ARE BOTHERED WITH NASAL TONES CAUSED BY GROWTHS OR SWELLINGS IN THE NASAL PASSAGES A SLIGHT PAINLESS OPERATION WILL REMOVE THE OBSTRUCTION THIS IS QUITE IMPORTANT
EVEN PRINCESS VARVARA PLAYING PATIENCE CONFIRMED THIS AND ANNA FLUSHING HOTLY GOT UP BUT INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN AS SHE HAD DONE TWICE BEFORE SHE STOOD STILL SHE SUDDENLY FELT ASHAMED OF HER DUPLICITY
READING OF ONE BOOK AFTER ANOTHER FILLED UP HER TIME BUT ON THE SIXTH DAY WHEN THE COACHMAN CAME BACK WITHOUT HIM SHE FELT THAT NOW SHE WAS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF STIFLING THE THOUGHT OF HIM AND OF WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE JUST AT THAT TIME HER LITTLE GIRL WAS TAKEN ILL
WHEN HE'S HERE I NEVER TAKE IT HARDLY EVER HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE ELECTION AND ANNA KNEW HOW BY ADROIT QUESTIONS TO BRING HIM TO WHAT GAVE HIM MOST PLEASURE HIS OWN SUCCESS
ENTIRELY A MATTER OF PREPARATION CERTAINLY NATIVE GIFTS FIGURE LARGELY HERE AS IN EVERY ART
FAILURE TO DO THIS RESULTS IN A BREATHY TONE TAKE IN BREATH LIKE A PRODIGAL IN SPEAKING GIVE IT OUT LIKE A MISER VOICE SUGGESTIONS NEVER ATTEMPT TO FORCE YOUR VOICE WHEN HOARSE DO NOT DRINK COLD WATER WHEN SPEAKING
HABIT HAS ESTABLISHED THE ORDER JUST SO YOU MUST MASTER THE LAWS OF EFFICIENCY IN SPEAKING UNTIL IT IS A SECOND NATURE FOR YOU TO SPEAK CORRECTLY RATHER THAN OTHERWISE
NEVER WALKED OUT WITHOUT A BOOK UNDER HIS ARM EITHER
CHAPTER FIVE DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY IN A FOREST RATHER THAN WITH A NOTARY
AS THE PORTER HAD SAID ENTIRELY IN BLACK IN PERFECTLY NEW GARMENTS AND WITH A WHITE CRAVAT
WE SAY MAKE BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER OF RESOLUTION AND OF PRACTISE IF YOUR VOCAL ORGANS ARE HEALTHY YOUR TONE PASSAGES MAY BE PARTLY CLOSED BY ENLARGED TONSILS ADENOIDS OR ENLARGED TURBINATE BONES OF THE NOSE
AT FIRST BLUSH IT WOULD SEEM THAT FLUENCY CONSISTS IN A READY EASY USE OF WORDS
HE'S A LEARNED MAN WHAT THEN IS THAT HIS FAULT
MATRIMONY DIVORCE CHILD LABOR EDUCATION BOOKS
AND ARE YOU WELL HE SAID WIPING HIS DAMP BEARD WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND KISSING HER HAND NEVER MIND SHE THOUGHT ONLY LET HIM BE HERE AND SO LONG AS HE'S HERE HE CANNOT HE DARE NOT CEASE TO LOVE ME
DO NOT FEEL SURPRISED OR DISCOURAGED IF PRACTISE ON THE PRINCIPLES OF DELIVERY HEREIN LAID DOWN SEEMS TO RETARD YOUR FLUENCY FOR A TIME THIS WILL BE INEVITABLE WHILE YOU ARE WORKING FOR PROPER INFLECTION FOR INSTANCE
BECAUSE THE TRAINING OF THE VOICE IS ENTIRELY NEGLECTED AND CONSIDERED OF NO IMPORTANCE THESE ARE WORDS WORTH PONDERING
BUT IF THE HEAD IS HUNG FORWARD THE VOICE WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE GROUND INSTEAD OF FLOATING OUT OVER THE AUDIENCE VOICE IS A SERIES OF AIR VIBRATIONS TO STRENGTHEN IT TWO THINGS ARE NECESSARY MORE AIR OR BREATH AND MORE VIBRATION
HAVE YOU EVER STOPPED TO ANALYZE THAT EXPRESSION A READY SPEAKER READINESS IN ITS PRIME SENSE IS PREPAREDNESS AND THEY ARE MOST READY WHO ARE BEST PREPARED QUICK FIRING DEPENDS MORE ON THE ALERT FINGER THAN ON THE HAIR TRIGGER
THE SUDDEN SHOCK TO THE HEATED ORGANS OF SPEECH WILL INJURE THE VOICE AVOID PITCHING YOUR VOICE TOO HIGH IT WILL MAKE IT RASPY THIS IS A COMMON FAULT
PAINE RIGHTS OF MAN TRADE IT MAY HELP SOCIETY EXTEND
HOW MUCH DAILY PRACTISE DO YOU CONSIDER NECESSARY FOR THE PROPER DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR VOICE SEVEN HOW CAN RESONANCE AND CARRYING POWER BE DEVELOPED EIGHT WHAT ARE YOUR VOICE FAULTS
SHE SAID TELL ME FRANKLY YOU WERE VEXED AT GETTING MY LETTER AND YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME AS SOON AS SHE HAD SAID IT SHE FELT THAT HOWEVER WARM HIS FEELINGS WERE TO HER HE HAD NOT FORGIVEN HER FOR THAT YES HE SAID
IN PRACTISING VOICE EXERCISES AND IN SPEAKING NEVER FORCE YOUR TONES EASE MUST BE YOUR WATCHWORD THE VOICE IS A DELICATE INSTRUMENT AND YOU MUST NOT HANDLE IT WITH HAMMER AND TONGS DON'T MAKE YOUR VOICE GO
THE SENSATION IS SO SLIGHT THAT YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO DETECT IT AT ONCE BUT PERSEVERE IN YOUR PRACTISE ALWAYS THINKING THE TONE FORWARD AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED BY FEELING YOUR VOICE STRIKE THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH
ANNA BEGAN TO LOOK AFTER HER BUT EVEN THAT DID NOT DISTRACT HER MIND ESPECIALLY AS THE ILLNESS WAS NOT SERIOUS HOWEVER HARD SHE TRIED SHE COULD NOT LOVE THIS LITTLE CHILD AND TO FEIGN LOVE WAS BEYOND HER POWERS
THE TALKER GAINS AS MUCH FROM HIS CONVERSATION AS THE LISTENER YOU SOMETIMES BEGIN TO CONVERSE ON A SUBJECT THINKING YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE TO SAY BUT ONE IDEA GIVES BIRTH TO ANOTHER AND YOU ARE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THE MORE YOU GIVE THE MORE YOU HAVE TO GIVE
ONE EASE SIGNOR BONCI OF THE METROPOLITAN OPERA COMPANY SAYS THAT THE SECRET OF GOOD VOICE IS RELAXATION AND THIS IS TRUE FOR RELAXATION IS THE BASIS OF EASE
MAKE A TWO MINUTE SPEECH ON ANY OF THE FOLLOWING GENERAL SUBJECTS BUT YOU WILL FIND THAT YOUR IDEAS WILL COME MORE READILY IF YOU NARROW YOUR SUBJECT BY TAKING SOME SPECIFIC PHASE OF IT
WHY YOU KNOW THAT'S MY ONE DESIRE BUT FOR THAT WE MUST GET A DIVORCE I WILL WRITE TO HIM I SEE I CANNOT GO ON LIKE THIS BUT I WILL COME WITH YOU TO MOSCOW
BUT PREPARATION MUST ALSO BE OF ANOTHER SORT THAN THE GATHERING ORGANIZING AND SHAPING OF MATERIALS IT MUST INCLUDE PRACTISE WHICH LIKE MENTAL PREPARATION MUST BE BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIAL
GENERAL PREPARATION CONSISTS OF ALL THAT A MAN HAS PUT INTO HIMSELF ALL THAT HEREDITY AND ENVIRONMENT HAVE INSTILLED INTO HIM
IF SO A SKILLED PHYSICIAN SHOULD BE CONSULTED THE NOSE IS AN IMPORTANT TONE PASSAGE AND SHOULD BE KEPT OPEN AND FREE FOR PERFECT TONES WHAT WE CALL TALKING THROUGH THE NOSE IS NOT TALKING THROUGH THE NOSE
KINDNESS JUSTICE PROGRESS MACHINERY INVENTION WEALTH POVERTY
AFTER THIS EXERCISE HAS BEEN MASTERED THE FOLLOWING WILL ALSO BE FOUND EXCELLENT FOR FLEXIBILITY OF LIPS MEMORIZE THESE SOUNDS INDICATED NOT THE EXPRESSIONS SO THAT YOU CAN REPEAT THEM RAPIDLY
WHAT HAS MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE TO DO WITH THE QUESTION INQUIRED THE STARTLED GRANDFATHER I AM SHE REPLIED COSETTE
I ONLY MEANT TO SAY THAT MATTERS OF REAL IMPORTANCE MAY TURN UP NOW FOR INSTANCE I SHALL HAVE TO GO TO MOSCOW TO ARRANGE ABOUT THE HOUSE OH ANNA WHY ARE YOU SO IRRITABLE DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU
BY TRYING TO ENCOMPASS YOUR WAIST WITH YOUR FINGERS AND THUMBS FORCE ALL THE AIR OUT OF THE LUNGS TAKE A DEEP BREATH REMEMBER ALL THE ACTIVITY IS TO BE CENTERED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY
ENDEAVORING TO FEEL ALL PORTIONS OF YOUR BODY VIBRATE AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU HAVE ATTAINED THIS YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS A PLEASANT SENSATION WHAT HO MY JOVIAL MATES COME ON WE WILL FROLIC IT LIKE FAIRIES FRISKING IN THE MERRY MOONSHINE
SHE FELT POSITIVELY VEXED WITH HER FOR GETTING BETTER FROM THE VERY MOMENT HER LETTER WAS SENT OFF THEN SHE THOUGHT OF HIM THAT HE WAS HERE ALL OF HIM WITH HIS HANDS HIS EYES SHE HEARD HIS VOICE AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING
CHAPTER ELEVEN FLUENCY THROUGH PREPARATION
REPEAT THE EXERCISE PLACING YOUR HANDS ON THE SMALL OF THE BACK AND FORCING THEM OUT AS YOU INHALE MANY METHODS FOR DEEP BREATHING HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY VARIOUS AUTHORITIES GET THE AIR INTO YOUR LUNGS THAT IS THE IMPORTANT THING
HIEROGLYPHICAL FIGURES SIX CONTAIN HUMAN FACES
EITHER NIGHT OR DAY BUT WOULD ALWAYS BE SPEAKING TO HIM ABOUT THESE MATTERS AND ABOUT HEROD'S TREACHEROUS DESIGNS SHE AT LAST PREVAILED WITH HIM TO INTRUST
NOW WHAT IS THE PECULIARITY OF THIS HIEROGLYPH THE CIRCLE BELOW IS NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THERE ARE MANY CIRCULAR FIGURES IN THE MAYA ALPHABET CLEARLY IF ONE WAS CALLED UPON TO SIMPLIFY THIS HE WOULD RETAIN THE TWO SMALL CIRCLES JOINED SIDE BY SIDE
AN ERECT SERPENT WITH AN ENLARGED BODY A SACRED EMBLEM FOUND IN THE HAIR OF THEIR DEITIES
THE M HERE IS CERTAINLY INDICATED BY THE CENTRAL PART OF THIS COMBINATION THE FIGURE WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM IT IS CLEARLY TAKEN FROM THE HEART OF THE ORIGINAL FIGURE WHEREIN IT APPEARS WHAT DOES THIS PROVE
UPON HIS DEFEAT AT ACTIUM NOR UPON THE EVIDENT CHANGE OF HIS FORTUNE HAVE I TRANSFERRED MY HOPES FROM HIM TO ANOTHER BUT HAVE PRESERVED MYSELF THOUGH NOT AS A VALUABLE FELLOW SOLDIER YET CERTAINLY AS A FAITHFUL COUNSELOR
AND THE ILLYRIAN S
LET US SEE WHAT IS THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE HERE IT IS CLEARLY THE FIGURE OF A SERPENT STANDING ERECT WITH ITS TAIL DOUBLED AROUND ITS MIDDLE FORMING A CIRCLE
THAT WE SHALL DO AND BE THE SAME TO THYSELF FOR IT IS BUT CHANGING THE NAMES AND THE FIRMNESS OF FRIENDSHIP THAT WE SHALL BEAR TO THEE
LEFT BUT HYRCANUS AND THEREFORE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FOR HIS ADVANTAGE NOT TO SUFFER HIM TO BE AN OBSTACLE IN HIS WAY ANY LONGER FOR THAT IN CASE HE HIMSELF SURVIVED AND ESCAPED THE DANGER HE WAS IN HE THOUGHT
WITH THE MAYA OF CENTRAL AMERICA SIR WILLIAM DRUMMOND IN HIS ORIGINES SAID THERE SEEMS TO BE NO WAY OF ACCOUNTING EITHER FOR THE EARLY USE OF LETTERS AMONG SO MANY DIFFERENT NATIONS
HAD VERY READILY ASSISTED HIM IN THE AFFAIR OF THE GLADIATORS SO WHEN HE HAD OBTAINED SUCH A KIND RECEPTION AND HAD BEYOND ALL HIS HOPES PROCURED HIS CROWN TO BE MORE ENTIRELY AND FIRMLY SETTLED UPON HIM THAN EVER BY CAESAR'S DONATION
WITHOUT THE INTERMEDIATE STAGES OF THE ALPHABET WHICH PRECEDED THE ARCHAIC PHOENICIAN
THE ANCIENT GREEK WAS THE FOOT REVERSED
THE SERPENT AND THE PROTUBERANCE
OF INNOVATION AND NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE TO HIS TEMPER
THAT THE TWO LINES PROJECTING FROM THE UPRIGHT STROKE OF OUR ENGLISH K ARE A REMINISCENCE OF THE CONVOLUTION OF THE SERPENT IN THE MAYA ORIGINAL AND THE EGYPTIAN COPY
HE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE GOVERNMENT
MAGNANIMITY HE ALSO DESIRED THAT CAESAR WOULD NOT PUT TO DEATH ONE ALEXANDER WHO HAD BEEN A COMPANION OF ANTONY BUT CAESAR HAD SWORN TO PUT HIM TO DEATH AND SO HE COULD NOT OBTAIN THAT HIS PETITION
AND HE DID THEREFORE TRUST DOSITHEUS WITH THIS LETTER BECAUSE HE WAS A CAREFUL ATTENDANT ON HIM AND ON ALEXANDRA AND HAD NO SMALL OCCASIONS TO BEAR ILL WILL TO HEROD
OF THE PHOENICIANS INTO TH OR THETA Z AND S INTO SIGNS FOR DOUBLE CONSONANTS THEY TURNED THE PHOENICIAN Y
AND WHEN HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED NO MORE THAN FOUR HORSES TO RIDE ON WHICH MALCHUS HAD SENT HIM THEY PRETENDED THAT HEROD CHARGED THESE UPON HIM AS THE CRIMES OF BRIBERY AND TREASON AND GAVE ORDER THAT HE SHOULD BE LED AWAY AND SLAIN
WHICH POSSESSED A PHONETIC ALPHABET IN ANY RESPECT KINDRED TO THIS PHOENICIAN ALPHABET IT CANNOT BE THE CHINESE ALPHABET WHICH HAS MORE SIGNS THAN WORDS IT CANNOT BE THE CUNEIFORM ALPHABET OF ASSYRIA WITH ITS SEVEN HUNDRED ARROW SHAPED CHARACTERS
BUT THE WORKS OF THE DEVIL HE FORTUNATELY HOWEVER PRESERVED FOR POSTERITY THE ALPHABET OF THIS PEOPLE WE PRESENT IT HEREWITH LANDA'S ALPHABET
THE ARABIAN GOVERNOR RETURNED BACK FOR ANSWER THAT HE WOULD RECEIVE HYRCANUS AND ALL THAT SHOULD COME WITH HIM AND EVEN ALL THE JEWS THAT WERE OF HIS PARTY THAT HE WOULD MOREOVER SEND FORCES SUFFICIENT TO SECURE THEM IN THEIR JOURNEY
TENACITY THAT THEY WILL SPEAK NO OTHER IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE WHITES TO ADDRESS THEM IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM
EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPH FOR S IS
YET DID THERE COME UPON HIM A DANGER THAT WOULD HAZARD HIS ENTIRE DOMINIONS AFTER ANTONY HAD BEEN BEATEN AT THE BATTLE OF ACTIUM BY CAESAR OCTARIAN FOR AT THAT TIME BOTH HEROD'S ENEMIES AND FRIENDS DESPAIRED OF HIS AFFAIRS
ALEXANDRA'S REIGN WHO HELD THE GOVERNMENT NINE YEARS AND WHEN AFTER HIS MOTHER'S DEATH HE TOOK THE KINGDOM HIMSELF AND HELD IT THREE MONTHS HE LOST IT BY THE MEANS OF HIS BROTHER ARISTOBULUS
THIS IS SOMETHING LIKE OUR LETTER S BUT QUITE UNLIKE OUR N BUT LET US EXAMINE INTO THE PEDIGREE OF OUR N WE FIND IN THE ARCHAIC ETHIOPIAN A LANGUAGE AS OLD AS THE EGYPTIAN AND WHICH REPRESENTS THE CUSHITE BRANCH OF THE ATLANTEAN STOCK
SOME OTHER KINDRED WRITINGS THE VAU TAKES THE PLACE OF F AND INDICATES
NEITHER WINE NOR WATER WHICH LAST THE SOLDIERS STOOD IN THE GREATEST NEED OF AND BESIDES HE PRESENTED CAESAR
AMONG WHOM IT WAS INVENTED AND THE LAPSE OF TIME BEFORE THEY ATTAINED TO IT HUMBOLDT SAYS ACCORDING TO THE VIEWS WHICH SINCE CHAMPOLLION'S GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY ADOPTED REGARDING THE EARLIER CONDITION
TO BE A BENEFACTOR HE IS OBLIGED TO HAZARD EVERY THING TO USE EVERY FACULTY OF HIS SOUL EVERY MEMBER OF HIS BODY AND ALL THE WEALTH HE HATH FOR HIM IN WHICH I CONFESS I HAVE BEEN TOO DEFICIENT HOWEVER
LIKE A FIGURE EIGHT HERE AGAIN WE TURN TO THE VALLEY OF THE NILE
WHO BY MEANS OF IT HAS DECIPHERED SOME OF THE OLD AMERICAN WRITINGS HE SAYS THE ALPHABET AND SIGNS EXPLAINED BY LANDA HAVE BEEN TO ME A ROSETTA STONE
THE GOOD WILL OF THEM ALL BECAUSE HE WAS ASSISTING TO THEM IN A MUCH GREATER AND MORE SPLENDID DEGREE THAN THE KINGDOM HE HAD OBTAINED COULD AFFORD BY WHICH MEANS HE MORE AND MORE DEMONSTRATED TO CAESAR THE FIRMNESS OF HIS FRIENDSHIP
THE SAME SIGN WITH VERY LITTLE MODIFICATION WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY OBTAINED FROM THE MAYA ALPHABET AS THE SYMBOL FOR B TO ILLUSTRATE THIS WE PLACE THE SIGNS SIDE BY SIDE
THE MULTITUDE TO THEM WHILE SHE USED THESE PERSUASIONS HYRCANUS PUT OFF HER SUIT BUT AS SHE SHOWED THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN AND A CONTENTIOUS WOMAN TOO AND WOULD NOT DESIST
AS IT WAS LIKELY THEY WOULD BE BY REASON OF CAESAR'S ENMITY TO HIM THEY SHOULD THEN BE THE ONLY PERSONS THAT COULD TAKE THE GOVERNMENT AND THIS BOTH ON ACCOUNT OF THE ROYAL FAMILY THEY WERE OF AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE GOOD DISPOSITION OF
WITH A LETTER WHEREIN HIS RESOLUTION WAS DECLARED AND HE DESIRED THE ARABIAN GOVERNOR TO SEND TO HIM SOME HORSEMEN WHO SHOULD RECEIVE HIM AND CONDUCT HIM TO THE LAKE ASPHALTITES WHICH IS FROM THE BOUNDS OF JERUSALEM THREE HUNDRED FURLONGS
IN THE OLDEST KNOWN FORM OF THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABET THAT FOUND ON THE MOAB STONE WE FIND IN THE SAME WAY BUT ONE SIGN TO EXPRESS THE D AND T D DOES NOT OCCUR ON THE ETRUSCAN MONUMENTS T BEING USED IN ITS PLACE
INDICATED BY THE SAME SOUND A SIGN FOR J WAS AFTERWARD ADDED WE HAVE ALSO IN COMMON WITH OTHER EUROPEAN LANGUAGES ADDED A DOUBLE U THAT IS V V OR W
AS DID THE PHOENICIAN THAT IT HAS NOT DEPARTED SO WIDELY FROM THE ORIGINAL FORMS RECEIVED FROM THE COLHUAS THE ALPHABET BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THE VAST EXTENT OF TIME WHICH HAS ELAPSED AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE PROBABLY
AND HEROD CAME TO THEIR GREATNESS BY REASON OF HIS MILDNESS AND AT LAST HE MET WITH SUCH AN END FROM THEM
THEY ALSO HAD IT IN CHARGE THAT IF THEY SHOULD HEAR ANY MISCHIEF HAD BEFALLEN HIM THEY SHOULD KILL THEM BOTH AND AS FAR AS THEY WERE ABLE TO
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT SOME OF THE LETTERS OF OUR ALPHABET ARE INVENTIONS OF THE LATER NATIONS
AND WE FIND THAT THESE ARE THEMSELVES SIMPLIFICATIONS OF OLDER FORMS OF A STILL MORE COMPLEX CHARACTER TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE LETTER
IN TIME THE GREEKS CARRIED THE WORK OF SIMPLIFICATION STILL FARTHER AND ELIMINATED THE TOP LINES
AND ENJOYED THEM FORTY YEARS BUT WHEN HE WAS AGAIN DEPRIVED BY ANTIGONUS
TO ANTONY WHEN I DEMONSTRATED TO HIM THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT HE HAD TO SAVE HIMSELF AND NOT TO LOSE ALL HIS AUTHORITY WAS TO SLAY CLEOPATRA FOR WHEN SHE WAS ONCE DEAD THERE WOULD BE ROOM FOR HIM TO RETAIN HIS AUTHORITY
THE PARTHIANS AND THENCE RETURNED HOME AGAIN AFTER SOME TIME ON ACCOUNT OF THE HOPES THAT HEROD HAD GIVEN HIM NONE OF WHICH CAME TO PASS ACCORDING TO HIS EXPECTATION BUT HE STILL CONFLICTED WITH MANY MISFORTUNES
AS WELL AS BY THAT DECREE OF THE ROMANS WHICH CAESAR TOOK CARE TO PROCURE FOR HIS GREATER SECURITY HE CONDUCTED CAESAR ON HIS WAY TO EGYPT AND MADE PRESENTS EVEN BEYOND HIS ABILITY TO BOTH HIM AND HIS FRIENDS AND IN GENERAL BEHAVED HIMSELF WITH GREAT
OR EVEN OF ANY ONE AGE LIKE ALL OUR OTHER ACQUISITIONS IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE SLOW GROWTH AND ACCRETION OF AGES IT MUST HAVE RISEN STEP BY STEP FROM PICTURE WRITING THROUGH AN INTERMEDIATE CONDITION LIKE THAT OF THE CHINESE
WE EVEN FIND THE CURVED LINES OF THE MAYA T WHICH GIVE
YET THEY TELL US THAT TAAUT MADE RECORDS AND DELIVERED THEM TO HIS SUCCESSORS AND TO FOREIGNERS
PROCURED HIM CAESAR'S GOOD WILL ACCORDINGLY
AND THAT THE CASE WAS THE SAME WHEN HE CAME TO BE KING BUT THAT HE EVEN THEN COMMITTED THE MANAGEMENT OF THE GREATEST PART OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS TO ANTIPATER AND THAT HE WAS NOW ABOVE FOURSCORE YEARS OLD
ON THE PRINCIPLE ALREADY INDICATED TO REDUCE THIS TO ITS ELEMENTS WE WOULD USE A FIGURE LIKE THIS
AND WHEN HE DENIED IT HE SHOWED HIS LETTER TO THE SANHEDRIM
AND WHEN UPON HIS MEETING HIM HE DESIRED THAT HE WOULD LET HIM SPEAK TO HIM HE THEREIN EXHIBITED A MUCH MORE NOBLE SPECIMEN OF A GREAT SOUL FOR HE DID NOT BETAKE HIMSELF TO SUPPLICATIONS AS MEN USUALLY DO UPON SUCH OCCASIONS
THE FIRST HERMES HERE REFERRED TO AFTERWARD CALLED MERCURY BY THE ROMANS WAS A SON OF ZEUS AND MAIA A DAUGHTER OF ATLAS THIS IS THE SAME MAIA WHOM THE ABBE BRASSEUR DE BOURBOURG IDENTIFIES
F OCCURS IN THE SAME PLACE ALSO ON THE IDALIAN TABLET OF CYPRUS IN LYCIAN ALSO IN TUARIK BERBER AND SOME OTHER WRITINGS AMERICAN CYCLOPAEDIA
THE FIRST LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE THE FOOT OF A LION OR TIGER THE THIRD IS PLAINLY A FOOT OR BOOT IF ONE WERE REQUIRED TO GIVE HURRIEDLY A RUDE OUTLINE OF EITHER OF THESE
THE LATER PHOENICIANS
THE LEFT HAND LINE WAS DROPPED AND WE COME TO THE FIGURE USED ON THE STONE OF MOAB
BUT FOR HIS ENEMIES THEY ALL OUTWARDLY APPEARED TO BE TROUBLED AT HIS CASE BUT WERE PRIVATELY VERY GLAD OF IT AS HOPING TO OBTAIN A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER AS FOR HEROD HIMSELF HE SAW THAT THERE WAS NO ONE OF ROYAL DIGNITY
THE LATER GREEK BECAME OUR A
NONE OF WHICH BEAR THE SLIGHTEST AFFINITY TO THE PHOENICIAN LETTERS IT IS A SURPRISING FACT THAT WE FIND IN CENTRAL AMERICA A PHONETIC ALPHABET THIS IS IN THE ALPHABET OF THE MAYAS THE ANCIENT PEOPLE OF THE PENINSULA OF YUCATAN
DIEGO DE LANDA WAS THE FIRST BISHOP OF YUCATAN HE WROTE A HISTORY OF THE MAYAS AND THEIR COUNTRY WHICH WAS PRESERVED IN MANUSCRIPT AT MADRID IN THE LIBRARY OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF HISTORY
WE CAN SEE THEREFORE IN THE LANDA ALPHABET A TENDENCY TO SIMPLIFICATION AND THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD NATURALLY EXPECT WHEN THE EMBLEMS WHICH WERE PROBABLY FIRST INTENDED FOR RELIGIOUS INSCRIPTIONS
ALL THESE FORMS SEEM TO BE REPRESENTATIONS OF A SERPENT WE TURN TO THE VALLEY OF THE NILE AND WE FIND THAT THE EGYPTIAN
AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THAT LANGUAGE IS THE SAME AS THE ONE INSCRIBED ON THE MOST ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF THEIR COUNTRY SENOR PIMENTAL SAYS OF THEM THE INDIANS HAVE PRESERVED THIS IDIOM WITH SUCH
AS IN OUR WORDS CITRON CIRCLE CIVIL CIRCUS ET CETERA AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE MAYA ALPHABET CA AND NOT K IT EVIDENTLY REPRESENTS A DIFFERENT SOUND
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE EARLIEST PHOENICIAN ALPHABET DID NOT CONTAIN THE LETTER R
THERE IS HOWEVER A SYMBOL CALLED CA
WHETHER HE HAD RECEIVED ANY LETTERS FROM MALCHUS AND WHEN HE ANSWERED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED LETTERS BUT THOSE OF SALUTATION ONLY AND WHEN HE ASKED FURTHER WHETHER HE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY PRESENTS FROM HIM
A VERY FAIR REPRESENTATION OF AN R LYING UPON ITS FACE IS IT NOT ANOTHER REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE THAT THE P IN BOTH MAYA AND PHOENICIAN SHOULD CONTAIN THIS SINGULAR SIGN
AT SUCH JUNCTURES OF AFFAIRS AS WAS MORE WORTHY OF THE KINGDOM THAN HIMSELF AND IN CASE HE SHOULD BE SLAIN BY CAESAR HIS ENVY PROMPTED HIM TO DESIRE TO SLAY HIM
AND DID EVERY THING HE COULD THAT HE MIGHT ATTAIN THE GOVERNMENT THAT HE WAS NOT INDEED IN THE ARMY WITH HIM BECAUSE THE ARABIANS HAD DIVERTED HIM BUT THAT HE HAD SENT HIM BOTH MONEY AND CORN WHICH WAS BUT TOO LITTLE IN COMPARISON OF WHAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE FOR HIM
PRESERVE THE KINGDOM FOR HIS SONS AND FOR HIS BROTHER PHERORAS SIX WHEN HE HAD GIVEN THEM THIS CHARGE HE MADE HASTE TO RHODES TO MEET CAESAR AND WHEN HE HAD SAILED TO THAT CITY HE TOOK OFF HIS DIADEM BUT REMITTED NOTHING ELSE OF HIS USUAL DIGNITY
AND DESIRED HIM TO WRITE ABOUT THESE MATTERS TO MALCHUS WHO WAS THEN GOVERNOR OF ARABIA TO RECEIVE THEM AND TO SECURE THEM FROM HEROD FOR THAT IF THEY WENT AWAY AND HEROD'S AFFAIRS PROVED TO BE
THE NATION THAT BECAME MISTRESS OF THE SEAS ESTABLISHED COMMUNICATION WITH EVERY SHORE AND MONOPOLIZED THE COMMERCE OF THE KNOWN WORLD MUST HAVE SUBSTITUTED A PHONETIC ALPHABET FOR THE HIEROGLYPHICS
WITH THE LETTER M THAT IS DRAW FROM THE INSIDE OF THE HIEROGLYPH SOME SYMBOL THAT WILL BRIEFLY INDICATE THE WHOLE LETTER WE WILL HAVE ONE OF TWO FORMS
TO EXIST IN THE CASE OF THE MAYA M TO THESE
AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE SILKEN DRESS
IT WAS NOBLE AND SUBLIME ALL THAT WAS GREAT AND GOOD IN HIM RESPONDED HAD HE FOUND THE TRUTH AT LAST IN THE MEANTIME MONICA DETERMINED TO REJOIN HER SON ARRIVED IN MILAN THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN LONG AND DANGEROUS
THE FIRST DEGREE OF INITIATION IN THEIR SECT AND WITH ALL THE ZEAL AND ARDOUR THAT HE CARRIED INTO EVERYTHING HE DID HE WAS ADVOCATING THIS ABOMINABLE HERESY AND PERSUADING HIS COMPANIONS TO FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE HER EYES GREW DIM WITH WEEPING FOR HER SON
AND SWAM WITH AN EXULTING STROKE GIVING HIS BREAST BROADLY TO THE LOW BILLOWS AND SHOUTING VERSES OF LOVE AND DELIGHT TO HER AND WHILE THEY SWAM SWEETLY BEHOLD
WE HAVE LIVED PURELY THEY SAID WE HAVE STRIVEN AND CONQUERED THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY OLD MEN AND WOMEN WORN WITH AGE AND SUFFERING THEY LOOKED AT HIM REPROACHFULLY
IT WAS A CURIOUS SHAPE SO LONG AND NARROW ALMOST LIKE
CHAPTER SEVEN HOW SAINT MONICA'S HEART WAS WELL NIGH BROKEN BY THE NEWS THAT HER SON HAD ABJURED THE CHRISTIAN FAITH ILL NEWS TRAVELS FAST AUGUSTINE HAD SCARCELY JOINED THE MANICHEANS BEFORE THE TIDINGS REACHED MONICA
HE AS WELL AS THE REST HAD ABJURED THE CATHOLIC FAITH TO JOIN THEIR HERESY
THE DARKNESS WAS INDEED GREAT BUT THE FIRES WERE STILL SMOULDERING BENEATH THE ASHES LOVE HONOUR AND SUCCESS WERE ALL HIS AND YET HE WAS NOT CONTENT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS SOUL THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS COULD SATISFY
AND THAT IS TAKE NO MAN INTO YOUR SERVICE WHO DESIRES TO BE PAID EVERY MONTH THE YOUNG PRINCE THOUGHT THIS ADVICE RATHER ODD IF THE SERVANT HAD TO BE PAID ANYHOW
WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE THAN A RITE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT TO EVERYBODY'S SURPRISE THE YOUNG MAN RECOVERED HIS SENSES AND BEGAN TO MEND AUGUSTINE THEN LAUGHINGLY TOLD HIM WHAT THEY HAD BEEN DOING AND WENT ON TO MAKE FUN OF THE WHOLE PROCEEDING NEVER DOUBTING
HIS SECOND OF ADMIRATION HOW UNCERTAIN LIFE IS HE SAID SUDDENLY TO HIS COMPANION WE ARE IN THE EMPEROR'S SERVICE I WISH WE WERE IN GOD'S I HAD RATHER BE HIS FRIEND THAN THE EMPEROR'S HE READ ON WITH SIGHS AND GROANS
SADLY THE ARAB BOWED HIS HEAD NO MY MASTER
PUT YE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND MAKE NOT PROVISION FOR THE FLESH AND THE CONCUPISCENCE THEREOF HE READ
TO LOOK OUT UPON THE RIVER AND UPON THE DISTANT HILLS WHEN HIS GAZE SUDDENLY FELL ON A SILKEN SHROUD NEATLY LAID OUT ON A COUCH WITH HIS NAME EMBROIDERED IN GOLD THREAD ACROSS THE FRONT FOR THIS ALSO WAS THE PLEASURE OF THE KING
THE GOVERNOR HAD SENT BANDS OF SOLDIERS TO LIE IN WAIT FOR THE CREATURE IN ORDER TO KILL IT
AT LAST HE SHUT THE BOOK AND AROSE MY MIND IS MADE UP HE SAID I SHALL ENTER GOD'S SERVICE HERE AND NOW IF YOU WILL NOT DO SO TOO AT LEAST DO NOT TRY TO HINDER ME YOU HAVE CHOSEN WELL SAID THE OTHER I AM WITH YOU IN THIS THEY NEVER LEFT THE HERMITAGE
SWEET WORDS TO A LUTED VOICE AND THE YOUTH FELL UPON HIS KNEES BEFORE HER SMITTEN BY HER BEAUTY
HE FREQUENTED THE CHURCH NOW EVEN WHEN THERE WERE NO SERMONS FOR HE BEGAN TO FEEL THE NEED OF PRAYER ONE DAY WHEN ALYPIUS AND HE WERE ALONE TOGETHER THERE CAME IN A FRIEND OF THEIRS PONTITIANUS A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN WHO HELD A POST AT THE EMPEROR'S COURT FINDING THE EPISTLES OF SAINT PAUL UPON THE TABLE
THAT HOLY CHASTE DEVOUT AND SOBER WIDOW SUCH AS THOU LOVEST CEASED NOT IN ALL THE HOURS OF HER PRAYERS TO BEWAIL ME IN THY SIGHT AND HER PRAYERS WERE ADMITTED INTO THY PRESENCE AND YET THOU SUFFEREDST ME TO GO ON STILL AND TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT DARKNESS
CALLED SIMPLICIANUS GREATLY BELOVED BY SAINT AMBROSE FOR HE HAD BEEN HIS TEACHER AND GUIDE IN EARLY LIFE TO HIM AUGUSTINE RESOLVED TO GO HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP HIM HE TOLD SIMPLICIANUS
THE STRANGE KING HAPPENED TO BE IN A GOOD HUMOUR AND THEY WERE READILY ADMITTED TO HIS PRESENCE LAYING DOWN HIS OFFERINGS ON THE STEPS OF THE THRONE HE PRAYED THE KING TO GRANT HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE THE MONARCH LISTENED TO HIM IN SILENCE BUT ANSWERED AFTER A PAUSE
BUT HE WAS VERY HAPPY FOR ALL THAT TILL ONE NIGHT THE ARAB CAME TO HIM AND BEGGED PERMISSION TO RETURN TO HIS OWN LAND FILLED WITH DISMAY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
BY AND BY A SWELL SEEMED TO RISE ON THE WATER AND A FEW MINUTES LATER A HIDEOUS MONSTER PART BIRD PART BEAST AND PART SERPENT STEPPED NOISELESSLY
AT LAST THE NIGHT CAME AND WITH IT PEACE AS SHE SLEPT EXHAUSTED WITH WEEPING SHE HAD A DREAM WHICH BROUGHT HER A STRANGE SENSE OF HOPE AND COMFORT IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE WAS STANDING ON A NARROW RULE OR PLANK OF WOOD
DETERMINED THAT SHE SHOULD LISTEN THEN THE CHRISTIAN IN MONICA ROSE ABOVE THE MOTHER HER HORROR OF HERESY WAS FOR THE MOMENT STRONGER THAN HER LOVE FOR HER SON STANDING BEFORE HIM OUTRAGED AND INDIGNANT
HE HAD KNOWN HIM WELL IN ROME AUGUSTINE WAS INTERESTED HE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE STORY HE SAID VICTORINUS SAID THE OLD MAN WAS A PAGAN AND A WORSHIPPER OF THE HEATHEN GODS
HE HAD MANY TIMES PROVED THAT HIS MOTHER WAS WISER THAN HE SO HE PROMISED OBEDIENCE AFTER A VOYAGE OF SEVERAL WEEKS HE ARRIVED AT THE ISLAND OF WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SPOKEN IT WAS FULL OF HILLS AND WOODS AND FLOWERS AND BEAUTIFUL WHITE HOUSES STOOD EVERYWHERE IN GARDENS
FRIENDS OF HIS OWN WALKING TOGETHER IN THE COUNTRY CAME TO A COTTAGE INHABITED BY SOME HOLY RECLUSES A LIFE OF SAINT ANTHONY LAY ON THE TABLE ONE OF THEM TOOK IT UP AND BEGAN TO READ HIS FIRST FEELING WAS ONE OF ASTONISHMENT
NEVER SPEAK TO ME IN SUCH A WAY AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO KEEP MY AFFECTION HE SAID
THAT A STATUE HAD BEEN ERECTED TO HIM IN THE FORUM IN HIS OLD AGE AFTER EARNEST STUDY HE BECAME A CHRISTIAN BUT REMAINED A LONG TIME A CATECHUMEN THROUGH FEARS OF WHAT HIS FRIENDS WOULD SAY AT LAST TAKING COURAGE HE PREPARED HIMSELF FOR BAPTISM
AND WAS PROBABLY AN OLD FRIEND OF SYMMACHUS HE WAS OF A NOBLE ROMAN FAMILY AND FAMOUS ALIKE FOR HIS GREAT LEARNING AND PECULIAR CHARM OF MANNER HE WAS FAMOUS ALSO FOR HIS HOLINESS OF LIFE
RANG THE SWEET VOICE AGAIN AND AGAIN IN HIS EAR NOW ON THIS SIDE NOW ON THAT WAS THIS THE ANSWER TO HIS PRAYER
IN THE MORNING SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO AUGUSTINE AND TOLD HIM OF HER DREAM PERHAPS SUGGESTED HER SON ANXIOUS TO TURN IT TO HIS OWN ADVANTAGE IT MEANS THAT YOU WILL COME TO SEE THINGS AS I DO NO SAID MONICA FIRMLY
THAT HE COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND TO CONDEMN IT TO DEATH FOR HE KNEW WELL THAT
WHEN HE MET HIM A FEW DAYS LATER SHE IS ONE IN A THOUSAND MUCH HAD HAPPENED SINCE MOTHER AND SON HAD PARTED AND MUCH HAD TO BE TOLD THE FIRST THING THAT MONICA HEARD WAS THAT AUGUSTINE HAD LEFT THE MANICHEANS AT THIS SHE REJOICED GREATLY
THERE WAS ROMANIANUS WHO WAS THERE ON STATE BUSINESS
A SUDDEN PITY SEIZED HIM GO THY WAYS AND GOD BLESS THEE HE CRIED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT A SON OF SUCH TEARS SHOULD PERISH
NOW WHILE THEY WERE SPEEDING OVER THE WATER NOORNA SAID
AND HER THOUGHTS WERE OF OTHER VICTORIES AND OTHER CROWNS
HE HAD NOT YET FALLEN SO LOW AS THIS I WOULD NOT SACRIFICE A FLY HE RETORTED HOTLY TO WIN A CROWN OF GOLD THE MAGICIAN RETIRED IN HASTE AND AUGUSTINE WHO SUCCEEDED IN CARRYING OFF THE PRIZE WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE DEMONS
WITH THE WHITE ROBE OF HIS BAPTISM STILL UNSTAINED AUGUSTINE WAS INCONSOLABLE
WITH TRIGETIUS BOTH PUPILS OF AUGUSTINE'S NEBRIDIUS WHO HAD BEEN WITH HIM IN CARTHAGE AND WAS LIKE HIMSELF A NATIVE OF ROMAN AFRICA
AND EMBRACED HIM SAYING SAID I NOT TRULY WHEN I SAID I AM THAT I SHALL BE
AMONGST OTHER THINGS THAT HE HAD BEEN READING A BOOK OF PHILOSOPHY TRANSLATED BY A ROMAN CALLED VICTORINUS THE BOOK WAS GOOD SAID SIMPLICIANUS
IT IS TOO LATE MURMURED THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD STUDIED IN THE SCHOOLS OF PHILOSOPHY BUT ALL THE SAME PUT THE FISH IN THAT VESSEL FULL OF WATER AND WE WILL TAKE IT BACK TO SHOW MY FATHER THAT WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE COULD BUT WHEN HE DREW NEAR THE FISH IT LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH SUCH PITEOUS EYES
THAT NIGHT THE ARAB STOLE DOWN TO THE SHORE TO WATCH BUT BEFORE HE SET OUT HE RUBBED HIMSELF ALL OVER WITH SOME OIL WHICH MADE HIS SKIN SMART SO BADLY THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIS GOING TO SLEEP AS THE SOLDIERS HAD DONE THEN HE HID HIMSELF BEHIND A LARGE ROCK AND WAITED
HE CRIED AS THE YOUNG MAN ENTERED
FOR AS YET HE IS OBSTINATE AND PUFFED UP WITH THESE NEW IDEAS IF WHAT YOU TELL ME OF YOUR SON IS TRUE
ONE BY ONE HE LAID ASIDE THE FALSE IDEAS OF THE TRUTH THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HIM BY THE MANICHEANS IT WAS GROWING CLEARER TO HIM EVERY DAY TRUE THERE WAS MUCH THAT WAS ABOVE HIS UNDERSTANDING ABOVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF ANY HUMAN BEING AS AMBROSE FRANKLY ACKNOWLEDGED
WENT TO THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN AND THROWING HIMSELF DOWN ON THE GROUND WEPT AS IF HIS HEART WOULD BREAK HIS SOUL TOSSED THIS WAY AND THAT IN ITS ANGUISH CRIED DESPERATELY TO GOD FOR HELP SUDDENLY ON THE STILLNESS OF THE SUMMER AFTERNOON THERE BROKE THE SOUND OF A CHILD'S VOICE SWEET INSISTENT
TO BID FAREWELL TO THE YOUNG COUPLE IN SPITE OF HER GRIEF FOR THE DEAD KING THE QUEEN WAS OVERJOYED TO WELCOME HER SON HOME AND COMMANDED THE PALACE TO BE HUNG WITH SPLENDID STUFFS TO DO HONOUR TO THE BRIDE THE PEOPLE EXPECTED GREAT THINGS FROM THEIR NEW SOVEREIGN
IT WAS THAT WHICH HAD SAVED HIM FOR AS HE WROTE THE TRUTH BECAME CLEAR TO HIM HE HAD SEEN HOW MUCH THEIR DOCTRINES WERE TO BE AVOIDED
GRIEVE NO MORE THEN HE REPLIED FOR LOOK YOUR SON IS STANDING THERE BESIDE YOU MONICA TURNED HER HEAD IT WAS TRUE AUGUSTINE STOOD AT HER SIDE ON THE PLANK OF WOOD BE OF GOOD CHEER CONTINUED THE STRANGER
WE HAVE FOUGHT AND CONQUERED THEY SAID EVEN WE
HE WOULD GIVE UP ALL AND FOLLOW HIM THEN HAVING CAREFULLY MARKED THE PLACE HE SAT DOWN BESIDE ALYPIUS AND TOLD HIM OF HIS RESOLUTION WHAT ABOUT ME ASKED ALYPIUS PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING THERE FOR ME TOO LET ME SEE
IT WAS AN EXCELLENT AND HONOURABLE POSITION THE PROFESSOR WAS SUPPORTED BY THE STATE
AND HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO GO FURTHER THIS AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DO THIS AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP HE COULD NOT IT WAS TOO HARD AND YET TO STAND WITH BOTH FEET ON THE ROCK OF TRUTH WAS IT NOT WORTH ALL THIS AND MORE
AND TAUGHT RHETORIC TO SOME OF THE NOBLEST CITIZENS OF ROME
SHE TOLD HIM PLAINLY THAT IF HE SPOKE IN SUCH A WAY SHE COULD NO LONGER RECEIVE HIM AT HER TABLE OR IN HER HOUSE AUGUSTINE WAS AMAZED
YOU REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THAT THE LUCK MUST TURN AT LAST AND SO IT HAS
ALL HE DESIRED WAS A SHIP WHICH WOULD CARRY HIM TO SEE THE WORLD OF COURSE THIS WAS GRANTED HIM AT ONCE AND WHEN HE AND HIS FAITHFUL ARAB EMBARKED THEY FOUND HEAPED UP IN THE VESSEL STORES OF DIAMONDS AND PRECIOUS STONES
BUT I HAVE RECEIVED A SUMMONS AND I DARE NOT DISOBEY IT THE KING WAS SILENT TRYING TO CHOKE DOWN THE GRIEF HE FELT AT THE THOUGHT OF LOSING HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT WELL
WITH BENT HEAD HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND SOUGHT THE HOSPITALITY OF ROMANIANUS NO SOONER HAD HE GONE THAN MONICA'S HEART MELTED THE MOTHER LOVE SURGED UP AGAIN WITH BITTER TEARS SHE CRIED ON GOD TO HELP HER HER GRIEF SEEMED GREATER THAN SHE COULD BEAR
IT WALKED STEALTHILY UP TOWARDS THE FIELDS BUT THE ARAB WAS READY FOR IT AND AS IT PASSED PLUNGED HIS DAGGER INTO THE SOFT PART BEHIND THE EAR THE CREATURE STAGGERED AND GAVE A LOUD CRY AND THEN ROLLED OVER DEAD WITH ITS FEET IN THE SEA
AUGUSTINE WAS DISCOURAGED AND SICK AT HEART EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE AGAINST HIM THERE WAS NO HOPE NO LIGHT ANYWHERE
AND WHAT WAGES DO YOU ASK INQUIRED THE PRINCE WHEN HE HAD QUESTIONED THE NEW COMER AND FOUND HIM SUITABLE
FOR HE DID NOT SAY WHERE HE IS YOU SHALL BE BUT WHERE YOU ARE THERE HE SHALL BE AUGUSTINE WAS EVEN MORE STRUCK BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS MOTHER'S ANSWER THAN BY THE DREAM ITSELF THOUGH HE PRETENDED TO MAKE LIGHT OF BOTH
SOME STRONG AND VIGOROUS SOME FEEBLE AND SICKLY
MANY MEN OF NOTE JOINED HIS SCHOOL AND HIS NAME BEGAN TO BE FAMOUS HE GREATLY DESIRED HONOUR HE TELLS US BUT ONLY IF HONOURABLY WON ONE DAY A CERTAIN MAGICIAN PAID HIM A VISIT
HE LIKEWISE AND PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO A CURRENT THAT HURRIED THEM OFF IN ITS COURSE AND CARRIED THEM AS WEEDS STREAMING RAPIDLY HE WAS BEARING WITNESS TO HIS FAITH AS A MAN THAT HAS LOST HOPE OF LIFE WHEN A STRONG EDDY STAYED HIM
THE OTHER PART WAS A COMPLETE DESERT
HE TOOK THE BOOK FROM AUGUSTINE OPENED AT THE PLACE HE HAD MARKED AND READ HE THAT IS WEAK IN THE FAITH TAKE UNTO YOU THAT WILL DO VERY WELL FOR ME HE SAID AUGUSTINE'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS FOR MONICA
BUT OF COURSE SOMEBODY RAN AT ONCE TO THE QUEEN AND TOLD HER OF THE KING'S ORDER AND SHE PUT COMMON CLOTHES ON THE PRINCE AND FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH GOLD AND HURRIED HIM ON BOARD A SHIP WHICH WAS SAILING THAT NIGHT FOR A DISTANT ISLAND YOUR FATHER WILL REPENT SOME DAY
WHEN THIS FRIEND WAS TAKEN SUDDENLY ILL HE LAY UNCONSCIOUS IN A BURNING FEVER THERE SEEMED TO BE NO HOPE OF RECOVERY
GREAT HOPE HAS DAWNED WROTE AUGUSTINE THE CATHOLIC FAITH TEACHES NOT WHAT WE THOUGHT AND VAINLY ACCUSED IT OF LIFE IS VAIN DEATH UNCERTAIN IF IT STEALS UPON US OF A SUDDEN IN WHAT STATE SHALL WE DEPART HENCE
AUGUSTINE'S SELF CONTROL WAS LEAVING HIM
AND WHEN NIGHT FELL SHE WOULD SING TO HER HARP OR THE PRINCE WOULD TELL HER TALES OF HIS OWN COUNTRY ONE EVENING A MAN IN A STRANGE GARB WITH A FACE BURNT BROWN BY THE SUN ARRIVED AT COURT HE ASKED TO SEE THE BRIDEGROOM AND FALLING ON HIS FACE ANNOUNCED
WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT WAS IN ATHENS EVEN DURING HER PALMIEST DAYS OWING TO THE LACK OF AUTHENTIC DOCUMENTS WE KNOW BUT LITTLE OF THE HISTORY OF THE ROMAN PEOPLE DURING THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OF THEIR EXISTENCE
WHO WISHED TO LIMIT THE ACTIVITIES OF THEIR WIVES TO THE SPINDLE THE DISTAFF AND THE LOOM AND THE OTHER OCCUPATIONS OF THE HOUSEHOLD FOR AS IN GREECE THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED VIEW WAS THAT WOMAN IN THE LANGUAGE OF GIBBON WAS CREATED TO PLEASE AND OBEY
SHE WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO HAVE REACHED THE AGE OF REASON OR EXPERIENCE AND HER NOBLEST EPITAPH IT WAS AVERRED WAS COUCHED IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS SHE WAS GENTLE PIOUS LOVED HER HUSBAND WAS SKILLFUL AT THE LOOM
WHEN THEY ARE ACCORDED THE NECESSARY FREEDOM OF ACTION AND WHEN THEY ARE PROPERLY EQUIPPED FOR WORK BY EDUCATION AND BY ASSOCIATION WITH MEN OF LEARNING AND EXPERIENCE COMPARING THE SECLUDED AND ILLITERATE GREEK WIFE
AMONG THE FIRST CONVENT SCHOOLS TO ACHIEVE DISTINCTION WERE THOSE OF ARLES AND POITIERS IN GAUL IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SIXTH CENTURY THE ABBESS OF POITIERS IS KNOWN TO US AS SAINT RADEGUND
READ MY BOOK OF KINGS READ ALSO THE LATIN AND GREEK TRANSLATIONS AND COMPARE THEM WITH MY VERSION AND THEY DID READ AND COMPARE AND CRITICISE AND MORE THAN THIS THEY FREQUENTLY SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS AND CORRECTIONS
CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF EDUCATED WOMEN THAT LIVED IN THE LATTER DAYS OF THE REPUBLIC AND DURING THE EARLIER PART OF THE EMPIRE AND THEIR WELL KNOWN CULTURE AND LOVE OF LETTERS IT IS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT THEY MAY HAVE WRITTEN MUCH IN BOTH PROSE AND VERSE OF WHICH WE HAVE NO RECORD
WHOSE MINDS HAD HITHERTO BEEN CONFINED TO THE COMPARATIVELY BARREN FIELD OF ROMAN LETTERS THE SPLENDID CREATIONS OF GREEK GENIUS CAME AS A REVELATION TO BECOME THOROUGHLY VERSED IN GREEK POETRY AND PROFICIENT IN THE TEACHINGS OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY
THE LITERARY TREASURES OF ANTIQUITY WERE PRESERVED AND MULTIPLIED HERE MONKS AND NUNS LABORED AND STUDIED ALWAYS KEEPING LIGHTED THE SACRED TORCH OF KNOWLEDGE ET QUASI CURSORES VITAI LAMPADA TRADUNT
AND THE FULLEST MEASURE OF EDUCATIONAL FREEDOM ENJOYED BY THE ROMAN THAT ASPASIA IN SPITE OF ALL THE ODDS AGAINST HER WAS ABLE TO RISE TO SUCH A PINNACLE OF GLORY DOES NOT PROVE THAT SHE WAS THE SUPERIOR OF HER COUNTRYWOMEN
AND PASSING IT ON TO THE GENERATIONS THAT SUCCEEDED THEM THAT ANY OF THE GREAT LITERARY MASTERPIECES OF GREECE AND ROME HAVE COME TO US IN SPITE OF THE DESTRUCTIVE AGENCIES OF TIME AND THE WRECK OF EMPIRES
LITERARY PRODUCTIONS MUST HAVE MORE THAN ORDINARY VALUE TO SURVIVE TWO THOUSAND YEARS AND ESPECIALLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF SUCH REVOLUTIONS AND UPHEAVALS AS HAVE CONVULSED THE WORLD SINCE THE TIME OF THE PAX ROMANA WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS AT PEACE UNDER AUGUSTUS
LIKE HER ILLUSTRIOUS COUNTRYWOMAN SAINT HILDA THE ABBESS OF BISCHOPSHEIM WAS THE FRIEND AND COUNSELOR OF SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL RULERS CHARLEMAGNE THAT EMINENT PATRON OF SCHOLARS HAD A GREAT ADMIRATION FOR HER
QUITE AS LIMITED IN PROSE AS IT WAS IN POETRY AGRIPPINA THE MOTHER OF NERO WAS ONE OF THE FEW PROSE WRITERS WHOSE NAME HAS COME DOWN TO US FROM HER MEMOIRS IT WAS THAT TACITUS RECEIVED MUCH OF THE MATERIAL INCORPORATED IN HIS ANNALS
ONE REQUIRING KEENER CRITICAL SENSE OR MORE PROFOUND LEARNING THAN WERE PAULA AND EUSTOCHIUM OR ONE IN WHICH THEIR EFFORTS WERE CROWNED WITH MORE BRILLIANT SUCCESS THAN WERE THOSE OF THESE TWO SUPREME EXEMPLARS
HAD NO MORE LOVE FOR EDUCATED WOMEN THAN HAVE SOME OF OUR CONTEMPORARIES FOR A BLUE STOCKING HOUSEKEEPER HE GIVES HIS OPINION OF THEM IN THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTIC FASHION THAT WOMAN IS A WORSE NUISANCE THAN USUAL
AND WAS TREATED RATHER AS THE PEER AND COMPANION OF MAN THAN AS HIS TOY OR HIS SLAVE BESIDES THIS FOREIGN WOMEN WERE NEVER SO CONSPICUOUS IN ROME AS IN ATHENS EVEN AFTER GREECE HAD BECOME A ROMAN PROVINCE
I PASS OVER IN SILENCE ANNA AND ELIZABETH AND THE OTHER HOLY WOMEN OF THE GOSPEL BUT HUMBLE STARS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE GREAT LUMINARY MARY SHALL I SPEAK NOW OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS WOMEN AMONG THE HEATHEN DOES NOT PLATO HAVE ASPASIA SPEAK IN HIS DIALOGUES
THE PRONUNCIATION IS SO PLAIN AND SIMPLE SO PERFECTLY FREE FROM ALL AFFECTATION AND DISPLAY FROM WHICH I INFER THAT SUCH WAS THE ACCENT OF HER FATHER AND HIS ANCESTORS NOT HARSH LIKE THE PRONUNCIATION TO WHICH I HAVE JUST REFERRED
BY THE SUCCESS THEY ACHIEVED IN MOLDING THE CHARACTERS OF SOME OF THE GREATEST MEN OF THEIR OWN OR OF ANY AGE IT IS A SPLENDID TRIBUTE THAT CICERO IN HIS ORATOR PAYS TO LAELIA WHEN HE TELLS OF THE PURITY OF HER LANGUAGE AND THE CHARM OF HER CONVERSATION
SHE WAS THEIR TEACHER AND IT WAS HER EDUCATED AND REFINED MIND THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
WITH THE DECADENT PEOPLES OF THE ONCE GREAT ROMAN EMPIRE THERE WAS NO DOUBT A PARTIAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OF CIVILIZATION BUT THE CONSEQUENT DARKNESS WAS NOT SO DENSE NOR SO GENERAL AND LONG CONTINUED AS IS SOMETIMES IMAGINED
RECENTLY READ ME SOME LETTERS WHICH HE AVERRED HAD BEEN WRITTEN BY HIS WIFE I BELIEVED THAT PLAUTUS OR TERENCE WAS BEING READ IN PROSE WHETHER THEY WERE REALLY HIS WIFE'S AS HE MAINTAINS OR HIS OWN WHICH HE DENIES HE DESERVES EQUAL HONOR
AND SO PERSISTENT WAS HER ACTIVITY IN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS THAT IT IS SOMETIMES ASSERTED THAT SHE WAS THE PRIME MOVER OF MOST OF THE PUBLIC ACTS OF BOTH THESE RULERS THIS WOMAN WHOM OVID DESCRIBES AS HAVING THE FEATURES OF VENUS AND THE MANNER OF JUNO
AND IT WAS THE CRABBED OLD CATO THE CENSOR WHO GROWLED IN UNDISGUISED DISGUST WE ROMANS RULE OVER ALL MEN AND OUR WIVES RULE OVER US
AND GAVE HER MANY SUBSTANTIAL PROOFS OF HIS ESTEEM AND VENERATION PRINCES WRITES HER BIOGRAPHER LOVED HER NOBLEMEN RECEIVED HER AND BISHOPS GLADLY ENTERTAINED HER AND CONVERSED WITH HER ON THE SCRIPTURES
A LETTER WHICH EXHIBITS SO WELL THE RARE CULTURE AND LITERARY ABILITY OF THE WRITERS THAT WE CANNOT BUT LAMENT THAT WE HAVE NOT MORE OF THE CORRESPONDENCE WHICH WAS CARRIED ON
IT IS TRUE THAT THE MEN OF THE OLDER SCHOOL WHO WOULD LIMIT WOMAN'S ACTIVITIES TO THE DISTAFF AND THE LOOM STRONGLY OBJECTED TO THE INCREASING FREEDOM AND POWER OF WOMEN AND ENDEAVORED TO COUNTERACT THEIR INFLUENCE BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE
THE PURITY OF DIANA AND THE WISDOM AND CRAFT OF MINERVA
AND ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TYPES OF THE LEARNED WOMEN OF HER TIME WAS THE CELEBRATED DAUGHTER OF THE ELDER SCIPIO AFRICANUS CORNELIA MOTHER OF THE GRACCHI
DOES NOT HESITATE TO DECLARE THAT CERTAIN OF CAEDMON'S VERSES RESEMBLED SO CLOSELY CERTAIN PASSAGES OF THE PARADISE LOST THAT SOME OF MILTON'S LINES SEEM ALMOST LIKE A TRANSLATION FROM THE WORK OF HIS DISTINGUISHED PREDECESSOR
WHEN I LISTEN HE DECLARES TO MY MOTHER IN LAW LAELIA FOR WOMEN PRESERVE THE TRADITIONAL PURITY OF ACCENT THE BEST BECAUSE BEING LIMITED IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH THE MULTITUDE THEY RETAIN THEIR EARLY IMPRESSIONS
AND WHO SO EXERTED HER INFLUENCE FOR PEACE DURING THE TROUBLOUS TIMES IN WHICH SHE LIVED THAT SHE LIVES IN HISTORY AS A PEACEMAKER IN MARKED CONTRAST TO THIS GENTLE AND SYMPATHETIC WOMAN WAS THE ENERGETIC AND HEROIC AGRIPPINA
SHE TOOK PART IN ALL REPUTABLE ENTERTAINMENT WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE BESIDES THIS SHE HAD MORE AND GREATER LEGAL RIGHTS THAN GREEK WOMEN HAD EVER KNOWN
LEFT HER HOME IN ENGLAND TO FOUND A CONVENT AT BISCHOPSHEIM IN GERMANY WHICH UNDER THE DIRECTION OF ITS LEARNED AND ZEALOUS ABBESS SOON BECAME THE MOST IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL CENTER IN THAT PART OF EUROPE TEACHERS WERE FORMED HERE FOR OTHER SCHOOLS IN GERMANY
WITH THE FREE AND HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED ROMAN MATRON WE FIND ALMOST AS MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AS THERE IS BETWEEN A CHILD AND A FULLY DEVELOPED WOMAN ALL THE DIFFERENCE THERE WAS BETWEEN THE UNSOPHISTICATED YOUNG WIFE NOT QUITE FIFTEEN
BUT GREAT AS WERE THE FREEDOM AND EDUCATIONAL ADVANTAGES OF THE ROMAN WOMEN THE STARTLING FACT REMAINS THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW FRAGMENTARY VERSES OF SLIGHT MERIT AND OF QUESTIONABLE AUTHENTICITY
THE MOTHER OF JULIUS CAESAR IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THIS EMINENT MAN WAS AS MUCH INDEBTED TO HIS MOTHER FOR HIS SUCCESS AND GREATNESS
AND BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT THE WONDERFUL ADVANCE THAT HAD BEEN MADE IN THE GENERAL STATUS OF WOMEN SINCE THE DAYS OF PERICLES AND ASPASIA I HAVE REFERRED TO THEM ALSO
IT WAS SO FAR AS WE CAN DETERMINE IN FAVOR OF THE GREEK THE SOLE REASON THEN FOR SUCH A MARKED DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CAPACITY FOR WORK AND FOR ACHIEVING DISTINCTION IN INTELLECTUAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FIELDS OF ACTION AROSE FROM THE LACK OF EDUCATION IN THE ATHENIAN WIFE
HAD SO IMPRESSED HER FELLOW CITIZENS BY HER INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITY THAT SHE WAS CHOSEN AS ONE OF THE TWO CHIEF MAGISTRATES OF THE PLACE SHE IS KNOWN IN HISTORY AS MESSIA CASTULA
THERE WERE CENTERS OF CULTURE IN ONE PART OF EUROPE OR ANOTHER AT ONE TIME THE CENTER WAS IN ITALY AT ANOTHER IN GAUL AND AT STILL ANOTHER IT WAS IN BRITAIN OR IRELAND OR GERMANY BUT WHETHER IT WAS IN THE SOUTH
OF THE GENTLE AND VIRTUOUS CORNELIA HIGHLY EDUCATED AND OF COMMANDING PERSONALITIES BOTH THESE WOMEN LIKE MANY OTHERS OF THEIR TIME CONTRIBUTED MUCH TO THE MAKING OF ROMAN HISTORY
WHERE GEOGRAPHY HISTORY AND ETHICS WERE TAUGHT WHERE THE ART OF ELOCUTION WAS ASSIDUOUSLY PRACTICED AND THE WORKS OF THE GREAT GREEK AND ROMAN POETS WERE CAREFULLY READ AND EXPOUNDED
THUS CICERO TELLS US OF AN INTERVIEW WHICH HE HAD AT ANTIUM WITH BRUTUS AND CASSIUS BESIDES THE MEN THERE WERE PRESENT ON THIS OCCASION THREE WOMEN WHO TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THE DISCUSSION THESE WERE SERVILIA
SUCH A COLLECTION WOULD BE BEYOND PRICE AS IT WOULD COMPLETE THE PICTURE OF THE AGE SO WELL SKETCHED BY SAINT JEROME
PITS BARDS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND COMPARES THEM AND WEIGHS HOMER AND MARS IN THE BALANCE
BECOME PROFICIENT IN HEBREW AND DEEPLY VERSED IN SCRIPTURE SPECIAL MENTION SHOULD BE MADE OF PAULA
OF WHOM MARTIAL WRITES LET EVERY GIRL WHOSE WISH IT IS TO PLEASE A SINGLE MAN READ SULPICIA LET EVERY MAN WHOSE WISH IT IS TO PLEASE A SINGLE MAID READ SULPICIA BUT IF THE FEW AMATORY VERSES THAT ARE CREDITED TO HER
WHICH IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY STUDDED THE COAST OF NORTHUMBRIA AND WHICH WITH ALL THEIR NUMEROUS DEPENDENTS FOUND OFTEN A MORE COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT UNDER THE CROZIER OF SUCH A WOMAN AS HILDA
WAS SO BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE THAT IT SHOULD BE CONTINUED AMONG OTHER NOTEWORTHY MAKERS OF ROMAN HISTORY BESIDES THOSE JUST MENTIONED IS LIVIA THE WIFE OF AUGUSTUS AND THE MOTHER OF TIBERIUS SO GREAT WAS HER INFLUENCE
THE FORMER DESIGNATION SEEMS PREFERABLE FOR AS WE SHALL SEE THE LATTER IS MORE OR LESS MISLEADING DURING THE WANDERING OF THE NATIONS IN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES AND THE LONG AND FIERCE STRUGGLES BETWEEN THE BARBARIAN HORDES FROM THE NORTH
FOR IT IS PROBABLE THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR INFLUENCE ON JEROME AND THEIR ACTIVE COOPERATION IN HIS GREAT LIFE WORK WE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE LATIN VERSION OF THE SCRIPTURES THAT IS TO DAY KNOWN AS THE VULGATE THIS IS EVINCED FROM THE LETTERS OF THE SAINT HIMSELF
THE WIFE OF GERMANICUS IN MANY RESPECTS SHE WAS THE MOST COMMANDING PERSONALITY OF HER AGE AND EXHIBITED IN AN EMINENT DEGREE THOSE STERLING QUALITIES WHICH WE ARE WONT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE STRONG DIGNIFIED COURAGEOUS WOMEN OF ANCIENT ROME
AND ON THE FATHER'S SIDE FROM THE HALF MYTHICAL KINGS OF SPARTA
THE WONDER IS NOT THAT WE HAVE SO LITTLE OF THE LITERARY REMAINS OF GREECE AND ROME BUT RATHER THAT WE HAVE ANYTHING AT ALL AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT THE LITERARY WOMEN OF ROME
AND RARE MENTAL ENDOWMENTS THEY RECALL THE BEST TRADITIONS OF A CORNELIA OR A CALPHURNIA WHILE SO GREAT WAS THEIR PURITY OF LIFE AND SO UNBOUNDED WAS THEIR CHARITY TO THE POOR AND SUFFERING THAT THEY WERE HONORED BY BEING NUMBERED AMONG THE SAINTS OF THE EARLY CHURCH
AND SO GREAT WAS HER REPUTATION FOR KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM THAT NOT ONLY PRIESTS AND BISHOPS BUT ALSO PRINCES AND KINGS SOUGHT HER COUNSEL IN IMPORTANT MATTERS OF CHURCH AND STATE AS TO THE MONKS SUBJECT TO HER AUTHORITY
AND HIS INSPIRATION MORE EARNEST AND IMPASSIONED IT WAS THIS NORTHUMBRIAN COWHERD TRANSFORMED INTO A MONK OF WHITBY WHO SANG BEFORE THE ABBESS HILDA THE REVOLT OF SATAN AND PARADISE LOST A THOUSAND YEARS EARLIER THAN MILTON
MARTIAL DOES INDEED SPEAK OF A YOUNG MAIDEN IN WHOM WERE COMBINED THE ELOQUENCE OF PLATO WITH THE AUSTERE PHILOSOPHY OF THE PORCH AND WHO WROTE VERSES WORTHY OF A CHASTE SAPPHO BUT THIS WAS EVIDENTLY A GREAT EXAGGERATION FOR WE HAVE NO OTHER EVIDENCE OF HER EXISTENCE
HE'S A DELIGHTFUL CHILD OF COURSE BUT THERE IS A STRAIN OF UNBRIDLED PUGNACITY IN HIM THAT BREAKS OUT AT TIMES IN A REALLY ALARMING FASHION YOU MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN THE AFFAIR OF THE LITTLE GAFFIN CHILDREN I HAVEN'T
THE REST HAD BEEN BURIED UNDER THE PERAMBULATOR IF THE LOSS OF CALAIS UNLOOSED SUCH FURY IN HIM I TREMBLE TO THINK WHAT THE POSSIBLE LOSS OF THE ELECTION MIGHT ENTAIL ALL THAT HAPPENED WHEN HE WAS EIGHT HE'S OLDER NOW AND KNOWS BETTER
BECAUSE IT IS YOU WHO MUST ANSWER GOD AND YOU MUST ANSWER HIM FROM THE HEART EITHER WAY SO NOBODY ELSE HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT OH GOOD NIGHT CLOUDY YOU CERTAINLY CAN PUT THINGS IN AN AWKWARD WAY OH HANG IT
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT JUST IN THAT WAY YOU CALLED CHRIST OUR ALUMNUS THE OTHER NIGHT REMINDED THE LITERAL YOUTH SOLEMNLY SO I DID ACKNOWLEDGED ALLISON EMBARRASSEDLY WELL I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT BUT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT KIND OF LINE
NOW THIS WHOLE EVENING'S SPOILED I WISH I HADN'T GONE TO THE FRONT DOOR AT ALL I WISH I'D TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS AND LET EM KNOCK AND THERE WAS THAT STORY YOU WERE GOING TO READ AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE WHY NO IT'S NOT TOO LATE AT ALL SAID JULIA CLOUD CONSULTING HER LITTLE WATCH IN THE FIRELIGHT
AS SHE SLIPPED HER NOTE INTO AN ENVELOPE AND ADDRESSED IT FLORRIE HAMILTON HERSELF COULD BEST HAVE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE STREET IN THE FRESH MORNING SUNSHINE SHE DID FEEL HURT MUCH MORE KEENLY THAN SHE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE EVEN TO HERSELF
WE'RE A COMMITTEE REPEATED YOUNG HERRICOTE SITTING DOWN ON THE EDGE OF A CHAIR AND LOOKING AROUND MOST UNCOMFORTABLY AT THE LUXURIOUS APARTMENT HE HAD NOT REALIZED IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER
THE ELECTION WAS KEENLY BUT DECOROUSLY CONTESTED THE NEWLY APPOINTED COLONIAL SECRETARY WAS PERSONALLY POPULAR WHILE THE GOVERNMENT TO WHICH HE ADHERED WAS DISTINCTLY UNPOPULAR AND THERE WAS SOME EXPECTANCY THAT THE MAJORITY OF FOUR HUNDRED OBTAINED AT THE LAST ELECTION
AND THE NEW SAILOR SUIT THAT I'VE HAD MADE FOR HIM IS JUST IN THE RIGHT SHADE OF BLUE FOR OUR ELECTION COLOURS AND IT WILL EXACTLY MATCH THE BLUE OF HIS EYES HE WILL BE A PERFECTLY CHARMING NOTE OF COLOUR THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LETTING ONE'S AESTHETIC SENSE
SHE'LL COME I KNOW AND SHE IS SUCH GOOD COMPANY GET DICKIE TO RUN RIGHT OUT AND MAIL IT I DO WONDER IF FLORRIE HAMILTON WILL FEEL HURT OVER NOT BEING ASKED TO THE PICNIC SPECULATED MAUDE ABSENTLY
YOU MAKE JANE BRISTOL CHAIRMAN AND I'LL BE ON THE COMMITTEE AND I'LL GO AFTER HER AND TAKE HER HOME NOW WHO ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE ON IT THE PRESIDENT ASSENTED READILY HE WAS ONE NOT USED TO TAKING THE INITIATIVE BUT HE EAGERLY DID AS HE WAS TOLD WHEN A GOOD IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF
POOR YOU SAID HER SISTER MAUDE SYMPATHETICALLY MAUDE WAS MOVING BRISKLY ABOUT THE ROOM PUTTING IT INTO THE BEAUTIFUL ORDER THAT MOTHER INSISTED ON IT WAS NAN'S WEEK TO CARE FOR THEIR ROOM BUT NAN HAD SPRAINED HER ANKLE THREE DAYS AGO
I HATE GOING TO MISS BRAXTON'S FLORRIE WAS A NEWCOMER IN WINBORO HER FATHER HAD RECENTLY COME TO TAKE A POSITION IN THE LARGEST FACTORY OF THE SMALL TOWN FOR THIS REASON FLORRIE WAS SLIGHTED AT SCHOOL BY SOME OF THE RUDER GIRLS
WHO HAD NO CHILDREN OF HER OWN TOOK ME TO BRING UP HER HUSBAND WAS A SEA CAPTAIN AND SHE ALWAYS WENT ON HIS SEA VOYAGES WITH HIM SO I WENT TOO I ALMOST GREW UP ON SHIPBOARD WE HAD DELIGHTFUL TIMES I NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL
THAT'S WHERE OUR ALUMNI COME IN THEY OFTEN RUN DOWN TO COLLEGE FOR A FEW DAYS AND HELP US OUT WITH MONEY AND INFLUENCE AND EXPERIENCE IF YOU'VE GOT GOOD WORKING ALUMNI YOU'RE RIGHT IN IT YOU SEE WE GENERALLY APPOINT A COMMITTEE TO TALK THINGS OVER WITH THE ALUMNI
AUNTIE HAD BEEN A TEACHER BEFORE HER MARRIAGE AND SHE TAUGHT ME TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN FATHER MARRIED AGAIN AND THEN HE WANTED ME TO GO HOME TO HIM AND JACK AND OUR NEW MOTHER
GOT IT AT THE OFFICE ON MY WAY HOME WHO IS YOUR SWELL CORRESPONDENT FLORRIE OPENED THE DAINTY PERFUMED NOTE AND READ IT WITH A FACE THAT PUZZLED AT FIRST
AND RETURNED PRESENTLY WITH TWO LARGE PIECES OF BREAD LIBERALLY DOSED WITH NARCOTIC THE BREAD WAS THROWN DEFTLY AND UNOSTENTATIOUSLY INTO THE STYE BUT HYACINTH SAW THROUGH THE MANOEUVRE HE SET UP A PIERCING IMITATION OF A SMALL PIG IN PURGATORY
HURRY UP I CAN'T KEEP THE SOW WAITING MUCH LONGER AND DON'T YOU JOLLY WELL COME BUTTING INTO ANY ELECTION AGAIN WHERE I'M ON THE JOB IN THE REACTION THAT SET IN AFTER THE DELIVERANCE FURIOUS RECRIMINATION WERE INDULGED IN BY THE LATELY OPPOSED CANDIDATES THEIR WOMEN FOLK AGENTS AND PARTY HELPERS
I MUSTN'T SQUEAK THROUGH EXCLAIMED JUTTERLY HOARSELY YOU MUST OBJECT TO EVERY DOUBTFUL VOTE ON OUR SIDE THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE DISALLOWED I MUST NOT HAVE THE MAJORITY THEN WAS SEEN THE UNPRECEDENTED SIGHT OF A PARTY AGENT CHALLENGING THE VOTES ON HIS OWN SIDE
A BOY THAT I'VE PALLED WITH IS GOING TO FIRE A GUN WHEN THE POLL IS DECLARED TWO SHOTS IF WE'VE WON ONE SHOT IF WE HAVEN'T THE SITUATION BEGAN TO LOOK CRITICAL DRUG THE SOW WHISPERED HYACINTH'S FATHER SOME ONE WENT OFF IN THE MOTOR TO THE NEAREST CHEMIST'S SHOP
ALLISON POLITE TO THE LAST CLOSED THE DOOR WITH A COURTEOUS GOOD NIGHT AND THEN STOOD FROWNING AT THE FIRE JULIA CLOUD CAME SOFTLY INTO THE ROOM AND WENT AND STOOD BESIDE HIM WITH LOVING QUESTION IN HER EYES HE MET HER GAZE WITH A NEW KIND OF HARDNESS
THE IDEA THAT GOD WOULD CALL ME TO DO ANY OF HIS WORK WHEN I NEVER HAD ANYTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH THE CHURCH IN MY LIFE AND I DON'T WANT TO HOW SHOULD I KNOW WHAT TO DO WHY SHOULD HE EVER CALL ME I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHEN I DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT CHURCHES YOU'RE ALL OFF CLOUDY
AND THEY ALL WENT TO BED EARLY HAVING HAD A HAPPY SABBATH IN THEIR NEW HOME BUT MONDAY EVENING QUITE EARLY JUST AFTER THEY HAD COME BACK FROM SUPPER AND WERE TALKING ABOUT READING A STORY ALOUD THERE CAME A KNOCK AT THE DOOR THEIR FIRST CALLER
I ASK HER TO COME UP YES OF COURSE SAID NAN LAMELY WHEN HER MOTHER HAD GONE OUT SHE FELL BACK ON HER PILLOWS AND THOUGHT RAPIDLY FLORRIE HAMILTON MAUDE MUST HAVE ADDRESSED THAT NOTE TO HER BY MISTAKE BUT SHE MUSTN'T KNOW IT WAS A MISTAKE MUSTN'T SUSPECT IT
ALLISON STARED AT HIM AND THEN BROKE INTO A LAUGH AGAIN EXACTLY HE CRIED YOU'VE GOT ONTO THE IDEA
THINK AGAIN WHY I'M NOT EVEN WHAT YOU'D CALL A CHRISTIAN HE SURELY WOULDN'T CALL PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T WELL WHAT YOU'D CALL ENLISTED WITH HIM WOULD HE HE MIGHT ANSWERED JULIA CLOUD REFLECTIVELY SHE WAS SITTING ON THE END OF THE BIG BLUE COUCH
SHE CERTAINLY DOESN'T PUSH HERSELF IN AMONG US ONE WOULD THINK SHE HADN'T A TONGUE IN HER HEAD SHE IS THE BEST STUDENT IN THE CLASS ADMITTED MAUDE ARRANGING HER ROSES IN A VASE AND PUTTING THEM ON THE TABLE AT NAN'S ELBOW
AND HE WAS STUDYING THE CALM QUIET PROFILE OF HIS AUNT'S SWEET FACE AS SHE READ IN A GENTLE EVEN TONE PARAGRAPH AFTER PARAGRAPH WITHOUT A FLICKER OF DISTURBANCE ON HER BROW ALLISON WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF LISTENING TO THE STORY
AND THE VARIOUS COMMITTEE ROOMS BUT THERE WAS BLANK IGNORANCE EVERYWHERE AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE CHILDREN EVERY ONE HAD BEEN TOO BUSY IN THE CLOSING MOMENTS OF THE POLL TO BESTOW A THOUGHT ON THEM THEN THERE CAME A TELEPHONE CALL AT THE UNIONIST WOMEN'S COMMITTEE ROOMS AND THE VOICE OF HYACINTH WAS HEARD
YOU MEAN SAID BRYAN DRAWING HIS BROWS TOGETHER IN A COMICAL WAY BEHIND HIS GOGGLES YOU MEAN PRAY I SUPPOSE
WOULD BE ALTOGETHER WIPED OUT BOTH SIDES WERE HOPEFUL BUT NEITHER COULD FEEL CONFIDENT THE CHILDREN WERE A GREAT SUCCESS THE LITTLE JUTTERLYS DROVE THEIR CHUBBY DONKEYS SOLEMNLY UP AND DOWN THE MAIN STREETS DISPLAYING POSTERS
MY NAME'S HERRICOTE JOE HERRICOTE I'M PRESIDENT OF OUR CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR SOCIETY AND THIS IS ROY BRYAN HE'S THE SECRETARY THIS IS MAME BEECHER I GUESS YOU REMEMBER HER SINGING SHE'S CHAIRMAN OF OUR SOCIAL COMMITTEE
I MET THEM DRIVING ABOUT A BACK ROAD AND TOLD THEM THEY WERE TO HAVE TEA WITH ME AND PUT THEIR DONKEYS IN A YARD THAT I KNEW OF THEN I TOOK THEM TO SEE AN OLD SOW THAT HAD GOT TEN LITTLE PIGS I GOT THE SOW INTO THE OUTER STYE BY GIVING HER BITS OF BREAD WHILE THE JUTTERLYS WENT IN TO LOOK AT THE LITTER
WHILE LESLIE SWITCHED OFF THE LIGHT AND NESTLED DOWN BETWEEN THEM SCENTING A STORY WASN'T I TOO CLOUDY SHE ASKED HUNGRILY NO DEAR I THINK YOU WERE BAPTIZED IN CALIFORNIA IN YOUR MOTHER'S CHURCH AND I'M SORRY TO SAY I WASN'T THERE TO SEE
OH IF HE HAS BRAINS HE ALWAYS KNOWS OF COURSE BUT YOU DON'T SAY YOU'RE RUSHING HIM IN SO MANY WORDS AT COLLEGE WE MEET A FELLOW AT THE TRAIN AND SHOW HIM AROUND THE PLACE AND PUT HIM ONTO ALL THE LITTLE THINGS THAT WILL MAKE IT EASY FOR HIM AND WE INVITE HIM TO EAT WITH US AND HELP HIM OUT IN EVERY WAY WE CAN
YOU'RE ELEVEN AHEAD AT PRESENT AND ONLY ABOUT EIGHTY MORE TO BE COUNTED
ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL COMFORT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT ABOUT OF COURSE BUT THIS BELONGS ENTIRELY TO THAT LITTLE OLD RATTY CHURCH AND I HAVEN'T ANYTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH IT AND I WANT YOU TO FORGET IT CLOUDY FOR I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT
BUT WE'VE GOTTA HAVE YOUR HELP SAID THE YOUNG SECRETARY EARNESTLY THIS THING'S GOTTA GO IT'S NEEDED IN OUR CHURCH AND IT'S THE ONLY THING IN THE TOWN TO HELP SOME OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE IT'S JUST GOTTA GO
I SUPPOSE SHE WOULD RESPONDED THE PRESIDENT HESITATINGLY LOOKING TOWARD THE TWO LADIES OF THE COMMITTEE WITH A HALF APOLOGY WHAT DO YOU GIRLS THINK ABOUT IT OH I SUPPOSE SHE COULD PRAY SAID THE GIRL CALLED MAME WITH A SHRUG SHE DOES YOU KNOW OFTEN IN MEETING
AND I'VE GOT TO STAY HERE AND NURSE THIS FOOT NAN LOOKED VINDICTIVELY AT THE BANDAGED MEMBER WHILE MAUDE LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW TO PULL A PINK CLIMBING ROSE AS SHE DID SO SHE NODDED TO SOMEONE IN THE VILLAGE STREET BELOW
SETTLING INTO A BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE BUT I DON'T LIKE THOSE GIRLS ONE BIT AND I DON'T CARE IF THEY STAY IN SEVEN EGYPTS NOW LOOK HERE CLOUDY JEWEL PLEADED ALLISON YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ME INTO ANY SUCH CORNER AS THAT
PLEASE JUST TALK AND I'LL LISTEN AND ASK QUESTIONS FLORRIE DID TALK I'M NOT SURE WHETHER SHE OR NAN WAS THE MORE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT SHE COULD TALK SO WELL AND DESCRIBE HER TRAVELS SO BRIGHTLY AND HUMOROUSLY THE AFTERNOON PASSED QUICKLY
WELL I'M GLAD YOU HAD SUCH A NICE TIME TOGETHER DO YOU KNOW SOME OF THE GIRLS WERE VERY MUCH VEXED BECAUSE SHE WASN'T ASKED TO THE PICNIC THEY SAID THAT IT WAS SHEER RUDENESS NOT TO ASK HER AND THAT IT REFLECTED ON US ALL EVEN IF PATTY AND WILHELMINA WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT
WHY FLORRIE HAMILTON TO THINK YOU'VE NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT YOUR WONDERFUL EXPERIENCES
BUT I COULDN'T GO AND BE A A SORT OF SLACKER SAID LESLIE HER CHEEKS QUITE BEAUTIFULLY RED THAT'S ALL RIGHT YOU COME SAID BRYAN LOOKING SOLEMNLY AT HER WHEN THE VISITORS FINALLY TOOK THEMSELVES AWAY
ASSUREDLY SHE MUST BE LOOKED UP AND HELPED IF THAT WAS THE WAY THE TOWN FELT ABOUT HER POOR CHILD WELL SAID BRYAN IN A BUSINESS LIKE TONE I'M SECRETARY JOE YOU CALL THAT PRAYER COMMITTEE TOGETHER THURSDAY NIGHT AT YOUR HOUSE AT HALF PAST SEVEN AND I'LL SEND A NOTICE TO EACH ONE
THEN I BOLTED THE DOOR AND LEFT THEM THERE YOU WICKED
HE CAUGHT THE AMUSEMENT AND FIRED UP AT IT
I KNOW SAID FLORRIE WITH A SMILE I RECOGNIZED THEM AS SOON AS I CAME INTO THE ROOM THEY ARE THE SAME KIND OF ROSES AS THOSE WHICH GROW ABOUT GRANDMOTHER HAMILTON'S HOUSE IN ENGLAND I USED TO LOVE THEM SO IN
WE APPOINT SOME ONE TO LOOK AFTER HIM SPECIALLY AND A CERTAIN GROUP HAVE HIM IN THEIR CHARGE SO THE OTHER FRATS WON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO RUSH HIM I SEE THE OTHER FRATS BEING REPRESENTED BY THE DEVIL I SUPPOSE SAID THE ROUND EYED BOY KEENLY WITHOUT A SMILE
YOU LOOKED OVER YOUR FATHER'S SHOULDER AND SAW ME SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT AND SMILED THE SWEETEST SMILE THEN YOU JUMPED UP AND DOWN IN YOUR FATHER'S ARMS AND SPATTED YOUR LITTLE PINK HANDS TOGETHER AND CALLED OUT AH JAH
IT IS THE LAST TIME I SHALL LET HIM GO TO AN ELECTION EXCLAIMED HIS MOTHER THERE I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO EXTREMES SAID MISSUS PANSTREPPON
THEY'RE JOLLY WELL CROWDED THEY WERE PRETTY MAD AT BEING SHUT IN BUT NOT HALF AS MAD AS THE OLD SOW IS AT BEING SHUT OUT FROM HER YOUNG ONES IF SHE GETS IN WHILE THEY'RE THERE SHE'LL BITE THEM INTO MINCEMEAT
WE ARE MAKING THE DEMAND FOR A STRONG NAVY A SPECIAL FEATURE IN OUR CAMPAIGN AND IT WILL BE PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE TO HAVE HYACINTH DRESSED IN HIS SAILOR SUIT HE'LL LOOK HEAVENLY THE QUESTION IS NOT HOW HE'LL LOOK BUT HOW HE'LL BEHAVE
AND YOU KNOW I COULDN'T HELP THEM ANYHOW COME NOW DON'T YOU WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING LIKE THAT FOR CLOUDY I BELIEVE YOU'RE LAUGHING AT ME YOU THINK I'LL GO AND GET INTO THIS THING BUT I'LL SHOW YOU I WON'T AND THAT'S AN END OF IT
AND SETTLED HERSELF IN THE BIG WILLOW CHAIR BY THE LAMP WITH HER BOOK LESLIE WENT BACK TO HER CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND ALLISON FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN ON THE COUCH WITH A PILLOW HALF OVER HIS EYES BUT ANYBODY WATCHING CLOSELY WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT HIS EYES WERE WIDE OPEN
NOTHING INTENTIONALLY BUT SOME ONE HAD UNFORTUNATELY TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE HALF FRENCH THEIR MOTHER WAS A DUBOC YOU KNOW AND HE HAD BEEN HAVING A HISTORY LESSON THAT MORNING AND HAD JUST HEARD OF THE FINAL LOSS OF CALAIS BY THE ENGLISH AND WAS FURIOUS ABOUT IT
OH NO HE WASN'T ALWAYS MEEK SAID HIS AUNT THOUGHTFULLY AND HE TALKED JUST AS YOU ARE DOING WHEN GOD CALLED ON HIM FIRST TO LEAD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT HE SAID HE COULDN'T AND HE WOULDN'T AND HE SHOULDN'T
WE HAVE A PARTY DOWN AT MY HOUSE FRIDAY NIGHT WILL YOU COME ALLISON SAW THAT THE JOKE WAS ON HIM AND HIS RESERVE BROKE DOWN ENTIRELY WELL I GUESS IT'S UP TO ME TO COME HE SAID YES I'M GAME I'LL COME BRYAN TURNED HIS BIG GOGGLES ON LESLIE
I'M AFRAID WE GIRLS AT MISS BRAXTON'S HAVE BEEN GETTING SNOBBISH AND SOME OF US ARE BEGINNING TO FIND IT OUT AND BE ASHAMED OF IT JUST WAIT UNTIL SCHOOL OPENS SAID NAN VAGUELY ENOUGH IT WOULD SEEM BUT MAUDE UNDERSTOOD
HYACINTH STOOPED DOWN FROM HIS PERCH AND PUT HIS FINGER ON THE BOLT THE SOW PRESSED FURIOUSLY AGAINST THE DOOR BANG CAME ANOTHER SHOT HYACINTH WRIGGLED BACK AND SENT A SHORT LADDER DOWN THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE INNER STYE
AND TOLD THEM TO GO AND DO SOMETHING FOR HIM THERE WAS PAUL HE WAS ACTUALLY AGAINST HIM AND THERE WAS ABRAHAM HE LIVED AMONG REGULAR IDOL WORSHIPPERS AND GOD CALLED HIM TO GO INTO A STRANGE LAND AND FOUNDED A NEW FAMILY FOR HIM THE BEGINNING OF THE PECULIAR PEOPLE
WHO IS PASSING ASKED NAN FLORRIE HAMILTON IS SHE GOING TO THE PICNIC ASKED NAN INDIFFERENTLY NO SHE WASN'T ASKED OF COURSE I DON'T SUPPOSE SHE EXPECTED TO BE
A SUDDEN ROAR OF SHOUTING AND CHEERING WAS HEARD FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE TOWN HALL HYACINTH'S FATHER CLUTCHED A PITCHFORK AND PREPARED TO DASH INTO THE STYE IN THE FORLORN HOPE OF BEING IN TIME A SHOT RANG OUT IN THE EVENING AIR
THEY TOOK YOU TO THE OLD CHURCH WHERE ALL THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN HAD BEEN CHRISTENED FOR YEARS AND THEY STOOD UP AND ASSENTED TO THE VOWS THAT GAVE YOU TO GOD AND THEY PROMISED FOR THEMSELVES THAT THEY WOULD DO THEIR BEST TO BRING YOU UP IN THE NURTURE AND ADMONITION OF THE LORD
I'M GOING DOWN TO SEE YOU AS SOON AS I CAN WALK BUT DON'T WAIT FOR THAT LET US BE GOOD CHUMMY FRIENDS WITHOUT ANY CEREMONY WHEN FLORRIE WITH A LIGHT HEART AND A HAPPY SMILE HAD GONE
LOOK AROUND AND FIND SOME OF THE RIGHT KIND OF FELLOWS AND RUSH EM GET IN SOME NEW BLOOD THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID BRYAN DOGGEDLY I'M RUSHIN YOU HOW DO YOU DO IT I NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE YET SO I DON'T KNOW ALLISON LAUGHED NOW HE RATHER LIKED THIS QUEER BOY HE'S A NUT
YOU ARE TOLD TO COME IN YOU YOUNG RASCAL HE MADE UP HIS MIND AND PLACED ONE FOOT ON THE LOWEST STEP THERE WAS A GREAT GROWL UNDER THE VAN HE DREW BACK THE GAPING JAWS APPEARED
I HAVE PLAYED THE FLUTE TO THE HURRICANE I HAVE NOT POCKETED A FARTHING AND NOW TO NIGHT BEGGARS DROP IN HORRID PLACE THERE IS
THERE GLOWED WITHIN HIM THAT SUDDEN WARMTH SECURITY THAT OUT OF WHICH HE WAS EMERGING WAS OVER THENCEFORWARD THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE NIGHT NOR WINTER NOR TEMPEST
A LARGE NETTLE SPRINGING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL REACHED THE ROOF THE HOVEL HAD BUT ONE DOOR WHICH WAS LIKE THAT OF A DOG KENNEL AND A WINDOW WHICH WAS BUT A HOLE ALL WAS SHUT UP AT THE SIDE
HENCE ARISE ENTANGLEMENTS DREAMS THOSE CLOUDS INTERPOSE THEIR FOLDS AND THEIR TRANSPARENCIES OVER THAT STAR THE MIND
MADE BY THE REFLECTION OF SNOW AND SEA HE SAW A THING PLACED AS IF FOR SHELTER IT WAS A CART UNLESS IT WAS A HOVEL IT HAD WHEELS IT WAS A CARRIAGE IT HAD A ROOF IT WAS A DWELLING
EVERYWHERE THERE WAS RIME AND FROZEN SNOW THE LITTLE CREATURE WHOM HE CARRIED MADE HIS PROGRESS FEARFULLY DIFFICULT SHE WAS NOT ONLY A BURDEN WHICH HIS WEARINESS AND EXHAUSTION MADE EXCESSIVE BUT WAS ALSO AN EMBARRASSMENT
AND CHAFED BEFORE THE FIRE THE LIMBS OF THE EXHAUSTED AND BEWILDERED CHILD WHO AT THAT MOMENT WARM AND NAKED FELT AS IF HE WERE SEEING AND TOUCHING HEAVEN THE LIMBS HAVING BEEN RUBBED HE NEXT WIPED THE BOY'S FEET
ALL ITS LETHARGIES MINGLE THEIR NIGHTMARES ITS SLUMBERS ARE A CROWD AND FROM ITS HUMAN BODIES LYING PRONE THERE ARISES A VAPOUR OF DREAMS SLEEP HAS GLOOMY ASSOCIATES BEYOND THIS LIFE
THAT WHICH HE LOST WAS NOT THROWN AWAY BUT WAS GAINED BY HER HE FOUND OUT THAT THE POOR INFANT ENJOYED THE COMFORT WHICH WAS TO HER THE RENEWAL OF LIFE HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE
HE PERCEIVED AT A SHORT DISTANCE IN FRONT OF HIM A CLUSTER OF GABLES AND OF CHIMNEYS SHOWN IN RELIEF BY THE SNOW THE REVERSE OF A SILHOUETTE A CITY PAINTED IN WHITE ON A BLACK HORIZON
THE CHILD FELT THE COLDNESS OF MEN MORE TERRIBLY THAN THE COLDNESS OF NIGHT
EVEN GOOD WOMEN IN THEIR HOUSES A PELL MELL OF SHEDS THROWN FROM HER DEVIL'S BAG WOULD GIVE AN IDEA OF THAT IRREGULAR WEYMOUTH THE GOOD WOMEN IN THE SHEDS INCLUDED THE MUSIC HALL REMAINS AS A SPECIMEN OF THOSE BUILDINGS
IS IT THAT YOU ARE AFRAID OF TEARING A HOLE IN YOUR RAGS WORTHLESS VAGABOND IN THE STREETS AT THIS HOUR WHO ARE YOU ANSWER BUT NO I FORBID YOU TO ANSWER THERE YOU ARE COLD
NEVERTHELESS A REFLECTION OF THE FIRE ON THE CEILING ENABLED THE SPECTATOR TO READ IN LARGE LETTERS URSUS PHILOSOPHER THE CHILD IN FACT WAS ENTERING THE HOUSE OF HOMO AND URSUS
OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE PAUPER THE BOY DID NOT HESITATE HE APPROACHED THE GREAT MANSION THE DOUBLE FOLDING DOOR OF MASSIVE OAK STUDDED WITH LARGE NAILS WAS OF THE KIND THAT LEADS ONE TO EXPECT
WHICH HE TOOK FOR THE OCEAN HE NO LONGER KNEW IN WHAT DIRECTION THE SEA LAY HE RETRACED HIS STEPS STRUCK TO THE LEFT BY MAIDEN STREET AND RETURNED AS FAR AS SAINT ALBAN'S ROW
WHICH OF THE TWO REFUSALS SHOULD HE CHOOSE THERE IS THE ANCHOR OF MERCY THERE IS ALSO THE LOOK OF PITEOUSNESS IT WAS THAT LOOK WHICH THE POOR LITTLE DESPAIRING WANDERER THREW AROUND HIM
CRIED THE VOICE OF THE MAN THE JAWS RETREATED THE GROWLING CEASED COME UP CONTINUED THE MAN THE CHILD WITH DIFFICULTY CLIMBED UP THE THREE STEPS HE WAS IMPEDED BY THE INFANT
SHOULD HE CONTINUE THIS JOURNEY SHOULD HE ADVANCE AND RE ENTER THE SOLITUDES SHOULD HE RETURN AND RE ENTER THE STREETS WHAT WAS HE TO DO BETWEEN THOSE TWO SILENCES THE MUTE PLAIN AND THE DEAF CITY
HE HAD NO STRENGTH LEFT TO CALL OR SHOUT AT MELCOMBE REGIS AS AT WEYMOUTH NO ONE WAS STIRRING THE DOORS WERE ALL CAREFULLY DOUBLE LOCKED THE WINDOWS WERE COVERED BY THEIR SHUTTERS AS THE EYES BY THEIR LIDS
AND LEAVING BETWEEN THEM AWKWARD SPACES OF NARROW AND WINDING CHANNELS LANES AND PASSAGES OFTEN FLOODED
THE CHILD BOWED HIS FOREHEAD DREW THE SLEEPING INFANT CLOSER IN HIS ARMS AND COLLECTED HIS STRENGTH TO RESUME HIS JOURNEY HE HAD TAKEN A FEW STEPS AND WAS HURRYING AWAY
PLAYING ON HIS FACE WARMED IT FOR A MOMENT THEN LINGERED AND FROZE IN HIS HAIR STIFFENING IT INTO ICICLES HE FELT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER DANGER HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO FALL
TO LIE DOWN THERE AND DIE HOWEVER THE LITTLE INFANT LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST HIS SHOULDER AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN THIS BLIND CONFIDENCE SET HIM ONWARDS AGAIN
FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD CEASED TO SEE THE SMOKE SUCH INDICATIONS ARE SOON EFFACED IN THE NIGHT BESIDES IT WAS PAST THE HOUR WHEN FIRES ARE PUT OUT OR HE HAD PERHAPS MADE A MISTAKE
DURING THE LONG HOURS SINCE HE HAD BEEN DESERTED AND HAD BEEN JOURNEYING ONWARDS HE HAD MET BUT THREE PERSONS OF THAT HUMAN SOCIETY INTO WHICH HE WAS PERCHANCE ABOUT TO ENTER A MAN THE MAN ON THE HILL
SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WE CALL NOWADAYS A NEGATIVE PROOF ROOFS DWELLINGS SHELTER HE HAD ARRIVED SOMEWHERE AT LAST HE FELT THE INEFFABLE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HOPE
THE DESERTED CHILD CARRYING THE FOUNDLING PASSED THROUGH THE FIRST STREET THEN THE SECOND THEN THE THIRD
INTO IMPALPABILITY MYSTERIOUS DIFFUSED EXISTENCES AMALGAMATE THEMSELVES WITH LIFE ON THAT BORDER OF DEATH WHICH SLEEP IS THOSE LARVAE AND SOULS MINGLE IN THE AIR
MISANTHROPY PLAYS ITS PRANKS A STRANGE AND ALARMING GRINDING OF TEETH REACHED HIM THROUGH THE DARKNESS IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE BACK HE ADVANCED
FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS ABSORBED BY TWO EXIGENCIES AND BY TWO ECSTASIES FOOD AND WARMTH URSUS CONTINUED HIS IMPRECATIONS MUTTERING TO HIMSELF
NO ANSWER HE STRUCK AGAIN AND TWO KNOCKS NO MOVEMENT WAS HEARD IN THE HOUSE HE KNOCKED A THIRD TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND HE SAW THAT THEY WERE ALL ASLEEP AND DID NOT CARE TO GET UP
THE BOY WENT TO THE BRIDGE WHICH AT THAT PERIOD WAS A COVERED TIMBER STRUCTURE HE CROSSED IT
THERE BY CHANCE AND WITHOUT SELECTION HE KNOCKED VIOLENTLY AT ANY HOUSE THAT HE HAPPENED TO PASS HIS BLOWS ON WHICH HE WAS EXPENDING HIS LAST ENERGIES WERE JERKY AND WITHOUT AIM NOW CEASING ALTOGETHER FOR A TIME
AT THAT PERIOD BARS TO STREETS WERE FALLING INTO DISUSE THE STREET BEGAN BY TWO HOUSES IN THOSE TWO HOUSES NEITHER CANDLE NOR LAMP WAS TO BE SEEN NOR IN THE WHOLE STREET NOR IN THE WHOLE TOWN
ON THE STOVE WERE SMOKING A PORRINGER AND A SAUCEPAN CONTAINING TO ALL APPEARANCE SOMETHING TO EAT THE SAVOURY ODOUR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE HUT WAS FURNISHED WITH A CHEST
THE VILLAGE HAS ABSORBED THE CITY IT WAS THE BRIDGE WHICH DID THE WORK BRIDGES ARE STRANGE VEHICLES OF SUCTION WHICH INHALE THE POPULATION AND SOMETIMES SWELL ONE RIVER BANK AT THE EXPENSE OF ITS OPPOSITE NEIGHBOUR
THE CHILD TURNED BACK
A VESSEL RATHER LIKE THOSE USED FOR GRAINING WAX WHICH ARE CALLED GRANULATORS AND A CONFUSION OF STRANGE OBJECTS OF WHICH THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AND WHICH WERE UTENSILS FOR COOKING AND CHEMISTRY THE CARAVAN WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE
AND THE MAN SLIPPED THE KNITTED JACKET OVER IT NOW THE MAN KICKED THE STOOL FORWARD AND MADE THE LITTLE BOY SIT DOWN AGAIN SHOVING HIM BY THE SHOULDERS THEN HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGER TO THE PORRINGER WHICH WAS SMOKING UPON THE STOVE
AT THE SAME TIME AS THE MOUTH BETWEEN THE WHEELS A HEAD WAS PUT THROUGH THE WINDOW
DELUGES OF SNOW ARE POSSIBLE THIS WAS ONE
HE ALMOST RAN HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON THE ROOFS THERE WAS LIFE THERE HE NEVER TOOK HIS EYES OFF THEM A DEAD MAN MIGHT GAZE THUS ON WHAT MIGHT APPEAR THROUGH THE HALF OPENED LID OF HIS SEPULCHRE
YOU SHOULD SEE A LORD SUP IN MY TIME I HAVE SEEN DUKES EAT THEY DON'T EAT THAT'S NOBLE THEY DRINK HOWEVER COME YOU PIG STUFF YOURSELF THE ABSENCE OF EARS
APPARENTLY HE MADE MUCH MORE WAY THAN WAS NECESSARY HE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCE ON THE PLAINS WHERE BINCLEAVES FARM WAS AFTERWARDS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN WHAT ARE NOW CALLED SPRING GARDENS AND THE PARSONAGE HOUSE
AN INHABITED PIG STY TOLD THAT THE HOUSE WAS ALSO INHABITED THE HOUSE ON THE LEFT WAS LARGE HIGH BUILT ENTIRELY OF STONE WITH A SLATED ROOF
THE HOUSE OF STONE AND THE THATCHED HOVEL WERE EQUALLY DEAF TO THE WRETCHED THE BOY DECIDED ON PUSHING ON FURTHER
SHE ENDED BY FALLING INTO A SOUND SLEEP SHIVERING HIMSELF HE FELT HER WARM
DRIVEN BY THE WIND INTO THE DIPS OF THE GROUND WAS SO DEEP IN COMPARISON WITH A CHILD SO SMALL THAT IT ALMOST ENGULFED HIM AND HE HAD TO STRUGGLE THROUGH IT HALF BURIED HE WALKED ON WORKING AWAY THE SNOW WITH HIS KNEES
THIS WRETCHED BOY IS MORE THAN HUNGRY HE IS MAD IT IS NOT APPETITE IT IS FEROCITY HE IS CARRIED AWAY BY A RABID VIRUS PERHAPS HE HAS THE PLAGUE HAVE YOU THE PLAGUE YOU THIEF
WHAT A MAN FEELS A CHILD FEELS STILL MORE THE UNEASINESS OF NOCTURNAL FEAR INCREASED BY THE SPECTRAL HOUSES INCREASED THE WEIGHT OF THE SAD BURDEN UNDER WHICH HE WAS STRUGGLING
SO THAT THE FROST SHOULD NOT GET IN THROUGH ANY OPENING AND THAT NO MELTED SNOW SHOULD DROP BETWEEN THE GARMENT AND THE CHILD THE PLAIN WAS UNEQUAL IN THE DECLIVITIES INTO WHICH IT SLOPED THE SNOW
HE KNEW THIS BECAUSE HE FELT HER SUCK HIS CHEEK SHE DID NOT CRY BELIEVING HIM HER MOTHER HE WAS ABOUT TO TURN AND WANDER LONG PERHAPS IN THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE SCRAMBRIDGE LANES
HE KNEW THAT IF HE DID SO HE SHOULD NEVER RISE AGAIN HE WAS OVERCOME BY FATIGUE AND THE WEIGHT OF THE DARKNESS WOULD AS WITH THE DEAD WOMAN HAVE HELD HIM TO THE GROUND AND THE ICE GLUED HIM ALIVE TO THE EARTH
I HAVE SEEN KING JAMES SUPPING IN PROPRIA PERSONA IN THE BANQUETING HOUSE WHERE ARE TO BE ADMIRED THE PAINTINGS OF THE FAMOUS RUBENS HIS MAJESTY TOUCHED NOTHING THIS BEGGAR HERE BROWSES
HE DID WHAT HE CHANCED TO DO HE SET OUT AGAIN IN THE DIRECTION OF JOHNSTONE ROW BUT NOW HE NO LONGER WALKED HE DRAGGED HIMSELF ALONG HE LEFT SAINT MARY'S STREET TO THE LEFT MADE ZIGZAGS THROUGH LANES
AND WALKING HOME THE SLIGHT THREAD OF SENSE HALF WORN THROUGH HAD SUDDENLY SNAPPED HE KNEW THAT SHE LIKED HIM HAD SHE GUESSED THAT WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT THAT HE WOULD NOT
TO NOTICE THE LIGHT WHICH FLASHED IN THE MAJOR'S EYES I SAID MOTHER I NEVER WANTED TO LEAVE THE CONVENT IT WAS YOU WHO WANTED ME HOME NO SHE SAID IT WAS NOT I IT WAS YOUR FATHER
THERE WAS A GENTLE PATHETIC LOOK IN HIS PALE BLUE EYES AND A SLIGHT HESITATION OF SPEECH AN INABILITY TO EXPRESS HIMSELF IN WORDS CREATED A PASSING IMPRESSION OF A RATHER FOOLISH TIRESOME PERSON
SOME BLACK AND WHITE THEN HE'D WANT TO COME ROUND TO THE STUDIO I DON'T LIKE TO PUT HIM OFF AS YOU LIKE IT'LL BE A VERY JOLLY DINNER JOHNNY AND HERBERT ARE COMING BUT I DARESAY FREDDY'LL ASK WALTER
AND NOW HE SHOULD NOT SEE HER ANY MORE ONLY THREE DAYS AGO SHE HAD BEEN SITTING IN THAT BASKET CHAIR HOW WELL HE REMEMBERED HER WORDS HER LAUGHTER
HE TRIED TO KISS ME I WAS ALONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM AND HE SPEAKS IN A WAY THAT I DO NOT LIKE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T LIKE HIM HE FRIGHTENS ME FRIGHTENS YOU THAT FELLOW THAT FELLOW YES HE ASKS ME QUESTIONS
AND THAT IS WHY I TOLD YOU THAT MONEY IS EVERYTHING
YOU MUST TELL ME WHICH YOU USE MISTER HOSKIN CAN TELL YOU BETTER THAN I YOU CAN'T HAVE A BETTER MASTER DO YOU COPY MUCH HERE ASKED MILDRED I PAINT PORTRAITS WHEN I CAN GET THEM TO DO WHEN I CAN'T I COME HERE AND COPY
HE'LL DO ANYTHING I ASK HIM WHEN LUNCH WAS OVER CISSY AND ELSIE TOOK EACH OTHER'S ARMS AND WENT UPSTAIRS TOGETHER MILDRED HEARD CISSY ASK WHO SHE WAS ELSIE WHISPERED A PUPIL OF RALPH'S
AND HE LOOKED DOWN THE LANDSCAPE NOW WRAPPED IN A WHITE MIST THE HILLS WERE LIKE GIANTS SLEEPING THE LONG DISTANCE VANISHED IN MYSTERIOUS MOONLIGHT HE COULD SEE BRIGHTON NEARER WAS SOUTHWICK
AND DOESN'T KNOW HOW HE'LL PULL THROUGH WAS HE HERE THIS MORNING HE RAN IN FOR A MOMENT TO SEE ME I'M DINING WITH HIM TO NIGHT
AND ON THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY HAROLD TOOK HER UP TO LONDON BY THE TEN MINUTES PAST NINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE FOUND SOMETHING ROMANTIC IN THAT TRAIN THEY DROVE FROM VICTORIA IN A HANSOM
OF CHASTITY FOR CHASTITY HAD NEVER AFFLICTED HIM IT HAD EVER BEEN TO HIM A SOURCE OF STRENGTH AND COURAGE CHASTITY HAD BROUGHT HIM PEACE OF MIND BUT THE PASSION TO WHICH HE HAD IN A MEASURE YIELDED
MILDRED NOTICED THE EXPRESSION THAT PASSED OVER HER MASTER'S FACE IT QUICKLY DISAPPEARED AND HE SAID WILL YOU TAKE MISS LAWSON TO THE REFRESHMENT ROOM MISS LAURENCE YOU'RE GOING THERE I SUPPOSE
SHE LISTENED TO HIM HER EYES WIDE OPEN AND THEN IN HER LITTLE ALLUSIVE WAY SUGGESTED THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO COPY SOMETHING SHE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE HER LESSON IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY AS IN SUTTON BESIDES
AND FURTHER AWAY PAST THE SHADOWY SHORE WAS WORTHING
AND HAD GONE TO SHOREHAM IN THE INTENTION OF BREAKING HIS ENGAGEMENT BUT INSTEAD HE HAD WITNESSED A CRUEL AND TERRIBLE SUICIDE THE REASON OF WHICH WAS HIDDEN FROM HIM POSSIBLY NONE WOULD EVER KNOW THE REASON
WHICH HE WAS DESTINED TO FULFIL IF A HABIT AFFECTS US
AND THE DEXTERITY WITH WHICH HE PASSED FRESH SHEETS OF PAPER UNDER THE ROLLER WHEN HE HAD FINISHED AND WAS GATHERING THE SHEETS TOGETHER SHE SAID HOW CLEVER YOU ARE I THINK I PICKED IT UP PRETTY QUICKLY I CAN DO SEVENTY WORDS A MINUTE
IN WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN EATING HOUSE OF THE POORER SORT THERE WAS A COUNTER WHERE TEA AND COFFEE AND ROLLS AND BUTTER WERE SOLD PLATES OF BEEF AND HAM COULD BE HAD THERE TOO
ON THIS POINT HE WAS UNCERTAIN THIS WAS NATURE'S SECRET IN THE MIDST OF HIS STRESS OF MIND HIS EYES HAD WANDERED OVER HIS BOOKS THEY HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY THE COLOUR OF A SMALL THIN VOLUME
HE HAD WALKED UP AND DOWN HIS STUDY HIS MIND AFLAME HE HAD SAT IN HIS ARM CHAIR FACING THE MOONLIGHT CONSIDERING A QUESTION TO HIM SO IMPORTANT SO FAR REACHING THAT HIS MIND AT MOMENTS SEEMED AS IF LIKE TO SNAP
I DON'T WISH YOU TO BE VIOLENT FATHER BUT YOU MIGHT HINT TO MISTER MOULTON THAT I DO NOT WISH THAT MAN HE TOO IS MERELY AN EXPENSE I AM SURE FATHER THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT OF HIM TO PUT HIS ARMS ROUND ME
HAD SET HIS LIFE ABOUT WITH ENDLESS EVENTUALITY HE COULD NOT SEE TO THE END THE FUTURE HE HAD INDEFINITELY PLIGHTED AND HIS OWN INTIMATE AND PERSONAL LIFE HAD BEEN ABANDONED FOR EVER
IS HIS MASTER FACULTY AS THE BODY IS FOR THE PHYSICIAN AND THE TRAINER AND THE SOIL IS THE SUBJECT FOR THE HUSBANDMAN AND THE WORK OF THE GOOD AND WISE MAN IS TO USE APPEARANCES ACCORDING TO NATURE
I THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO SIT AND WATCH YOU HERE TAKE YOUR CHAIR I CAN GET ANOTHER
AGNES BUT YOU MUST NOT BREATHE A WORD OF IT TO ANY ONE IF YOU DID THEY WOULD TAKE THE MACHINE FROM ME FOR THEY'D LIKE ME TO REMAIN A MERE EXPENSE AS LONG AS I'M THAT THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY LIKE
SHE HAD WALKED WITH HIM ON THE HILLS SHE HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM AS FAR AS THE BURGH SHE HAD WAVED HER HAND TO HIM BEFORE THEY WALKED QUITE OUT OF EACH OTHER'S SIGHT NOW SHE WAS DEAD HAD HE LOVED HER
I'M NOT DISTURBING YOU FATHER NO DEAR YOU NEVER DISTURB ME HE SAID GETTING UP FROM THE TYPE WRITER AND GIVING HER HIS CHAIR BUT WHAT IS THE MATTER NOTHING AT LEAST NOTHING IN PARTICULAR
HE HAD RETURNED HOME THESE NEWLY CONTRACTED DUTIES HAD STIRRED HIS BEING TO ITS VERY DEPTH THE CHANCE APPEARANCE OF A GIPSY GIRL WITHOUT THE AID OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HE FELT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN
AND NEITHER WAY FOR WHAT IS NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL IN THE LIGHT OF THESE WORDS JOHN'S MIND GREW SERENE AS A LANDSCAPE ON WHICH THE MOON IS SHINING AND HE ASKED HIMSELF WHY HE HAD HESITATED IF MARRIAGE WERE THE STATE
AND OBEYING AN INSTINCT HE HAD TAKEN THE VOLUME DOWN HE KNEW IT WELL
WHAT DEAR MOTHER WILL WANT ME TO MARRY THEY SHALL NOT FORCE YOU TO MARRY THEY SHALL NOT ASK YOU TO DO ANYTHING YOU DO NOT LIKE LORD CHISELHURST OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED
AND HE HAD STOOD IN THE DAWN LIGHT PONDERING A MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM A POSITION INTO WHICH A CHANCE CIRCUMSTANCE HAD LED HIM HE HAD GONE TO BED HOPING TO FIND COUNSEL IN THE NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING HE HAD WAKED FIRM IN HIS RESOLVE
AND FOOLISH IS HE WHO PLACES HIS HAPPINESS IN THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD BUT WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HER SHE WAS MAD WHEN SHE THREW HERSELF OUT OF THE WINDOW TO ESCAPE FROM HIM BUT HOW HAD SHE BECOME MAD
HE WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND LOOKED ABOUT FOR THE PLACE HE HAD LAST SEEN HER IN SHE USUALLY SAT ON THAT SOFA
HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE HER ROUND THE GALLERY AND EXPLAIN THE MERITS OF THE PICTURES SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY FROM SUTTON AND THE PROSPECT OF LONG DAYS SPENT IN LONDON PLEASED HER
YES I'M GOING TO THE LUNCH ROOM AND SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO SHOW MISS LAWSON THE WAY AND IN COMPANY WITH QUITE A NUMBER OF STUDENTS THEY WALKED THROUGH THE GALLERIES MILDRED NOTICED THAT MISS LAURENCE'S NOSE WAS HOOKED
YOUR MOTHER SAID IN REPLY TO SOME QUESTION ABOUT ME THAT I WAS MERELY AN EXPENSE I BELIEVE THE PHRASE WAS CONSIDERED VERY CLEVER IT WENT THE ROUND OF SOCIETY AND EVENTUALLY WAS PUT INTO A PLAY
MISTER HOSKIN A YOUNG PAINTER WHOSE PICTURES WERE SOMETIMES REJECTED IN THE ACADEMY BUT WHO WAS A LITTLE LION IN THE MINOR EXHIBITIONS CAME ONCE A WEEK TO GIVE HER LESSONS AND WHEN SHE WENT TO TOWN SHE CALLED AT HIS STUDIO WITH HER SKETCHES
THAT JOHN FELT A SUPERNATURAL AWE CREEP UPON HIM FELT THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS A SORT OF SACRILEGE HE CREPT DOWNSTAIRS
NOR THE YOUNG MAN COPYING OPPOSITE SHE DID NOT NOTICE THEIR VISITS TO EACH OTHER'S EASELS SHE FORGOT EVERYTHING IN THE PASSION OF DRAWING TIME WENT BY WITHOUT HER PERCEIVING IT
YOUR MOTHER WOULD SAY YOU WERE WASTING YOUR TIME YOU'VE COME HOME SHE'D SAY TO GO INTO SOCIETY AND NOT TO LEARN TYPE WRITING I'M AFRAID SHE WOULD BUT FATHER THERE IS NO USE MY GOING INTO SOCIETY
A MAN OF HIS AGE TO WANT TO MARRY A YOUNG GIRL LIKE YOU I WILL GO AND TELL HIM SO THE MAJOR STOOD UP HE WAS PALE AND AGNES NOTICED THAT HIS LIPS TREMBLED NO FATHER SHE SAID DO NOT GO TO HIM
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WANT MONEY AND IN A RAPID GLANCE MISS LAURENCE ROUGHLY CALCULATED THE PRICE OF MILDRED'S CLOTHES A TALL
AND THROWING HER ARMS ON HER FATHER'S SHOULDER SHE SAID BUT FATHER YOU'RE NOT LISTENING LISTEN TO ME I'VE ONLY YOU I'M THINKING OF WHAT OF MANY THINGS POOR FATHER YOU HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO THINK OF
IT TOOK ME A LONG WHILE BUT I HAVE FOUND THE WAY THERE IT IS HE SAID POINTING TO THE TYPE WRITING MACHINE THEY DON'T SUSPECT ANYTHING NOT THEY THE FOOLS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS I'LL TELL YOU
HE NEVER SHALL DO SO AGAIN IS HE IN THE DRAWING ROOM YES BUT FATHER YOU CANNOT SPEAK TO HIM NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE DRAWING ROOM I DON'T CARE WHO'S THERE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT REASON IN AN AFFECTED MIND FOR SUICIDE BUT THIS WAS NOT SO HE KNEW IT WAS NOT SO HE HAD BEEN SPARED THAT SHE WAS HERE WITH ME YESTERDAY HE SAID
WILL YOU FATHER THEN I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU WE COULD SIT TOGETHER YOU IN THAT CORNER I IN THIS I WONDER IF MOTHER WOULD BUY ME A MACHINE I COULD PAY HER BACK OUT OF THE MONEY I EARNED JUST LIKE YOU
THAN SHE COULD THE ORIGINAL BUT ON THE WHOLE SHE GOT ON BETTER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND IT WAS NOT TILL SHE CAME TO THE FIFTH HEAD
HE THINKS ME CRAZY BUT SO DO OTHERS I KNOW THAT MY CONVERSATION BORES HIM HE ALWAYS TRIES TO GET AWAY FROM ME YET SOMEHOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I DO LIKE HIM IS HE A FAST MAN FATHER
BUT AS SOON AS I GAIN AN INDEPENDENCE AS SOON AS I AM ABLE TO PAY FOR MY MEALS HE WHISPERED I MEAN TO PUT MY HOUSE IN ORDER BUT YOU MUSTN'T BREATHE A WORD I'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING FATHER YOU ASK ME NOT TO DO
THEIR INTERESTS WERE MUTUAL THEY WERE IDENTICAL THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF EGOTISM
I SHALL NEVER GET ON IN SOCIETY LAST NIGHT AT LORD CHISELHURST'S YES TELL ME ABOUT IT YOU MUST HAVE ENJOYED YOURSELF THERE AGNES DID NOT ANSWER FOR A LONG WHILE AT LAST SHE SAID
WILL YOU GIVE ME YOUR CHARCOAL THE FIRST THING IS TO GET THE HEADS INTO THEIR PLACES ON THE CANVAS DON'T THINK OF DETAIL BUT OF TWO OR THREE POINTS THE CROWN OF THE HEAD THE POINT OF THE CHIN THE PLACING OF THE EAR
TO BREAK BUT WHICH WAS ACCEPTED BY NINE TENTHS OF HUMANITY WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT AS LIGHTLY AS THE MOST SUPERFICIAL DETAIL OF DAILY LIFE BUT HOW OTHERS ACTED WAS NOT HIS CONCERN HE MUST CONSIDER HIS OWN COMPETENCE
BROKEN BY THE SCUFFLING AND DISPUTING OF THE PEOPLE AT THE DOOR WE HAVE THE POWER IN OUR HANDS HE BEGAN SADLY STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WENT ON IN A LOW VOICE COMRADES
STUNNED BY THE RAPIDITY OF EVENTS STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF CANNON THE DELEGATES HAD HESITATED FOR AN HOUR HAMMER BLOW AFTER HAMMER BLOW HAD FALLEN FROM THAT TRIBUNE WELDING THEM TOGETHER BUT BEATING THEM DOWN
HE BECKONED TO AN APPROACHING OFFICER WHO GREW VERY AGITATED WHEN HE SAW WHO IT WAS AND SALUTED BEFORE HE REALISED WHAT HE WAS DOING VASHE VUISOKOPREVOSKHODITELSTVO YOUR HIGH EXCELLENCY HE STAMMERED IN THE MANNER OF THE OLD REGIME ACCESS TO THE PALACE
THE PLACE TO FIGHT IS OUT ON THE STREETS IMMENSE BAWLING OUTCRY YOU SPEAK FOR THE STAFF NOT FOR THE ARMY I APPEAL TO ALL REASONABLE SOLDIERS TO LEAVE THIS CONGRESS
KERENSKY FLYING TO THE FRONT THROUGH COUNTRY TOWNS ALL DOUBTFULLY HEAVING UP TCHEIDZE THE OLD EAGLE WHO HAD CONTEMPTUOUSLY RETIRED TO HIS OWN GEORGIAN MOUNTAINS THERE TO SICKEN WITH CONSUMPTION AND
AND IT IS BEING SETTLED BEHIND OUR BACKS BEFORE THE CONGRESS OPENS BLOWS ARE BEING STRUCK AGAINST THE WINTER PALACE AND IT IS BY SUCH BLOWS THAT THE NAILS ARE BEING DRIVEN INTO THE COFFIN OF THE POLITICAL PARTY WHICH HAS RISKED SUCH AN ADVENTURE UPROAR
WHERE ALL THE ARMY COMMITTEES CONSIDER THAT THE TAKING OF POWER BY THE SOVIETS ONLY THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS A STAB IN THE BACK OF THE ARMY AND A CRIME AGAINST THE PEOPLE SHOUTS OF LIE YOU LIE
CRIES YOU ARE ANTICIPATING THE WILL OF THE ALL RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS TROTZKY COLDLY THE WILL OF THE ALL RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
WILL YOU PLEASE GO TO YOUR CONSUL AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS I WILL GIVE YOU MY ADDRESS IN SPITE OF OUR PROTESTATIONS HE WROTE IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND SEEMED TO FEEL BETTER AT ONCE I HAVE IT STILL
OCCASIONALLY SOME ONE IN AUTHORITY MOUNTED THE TRIBUNE AND ASKED THE COMRADES NOT TO SMOKE THEN EVERYBODY SMOKERS AND ALL TOOK UP THE CRY
MEN IN VARIOUS UNIFORMS WERE COMING AND GOING IN AN AIMLESS WAY AND DOING A GREAT DEAL OF TALKING UP THE NEVSKY THE WHOLE CITY SEEMED TO BE OUT PROMENADING
AND THERE SEEMED EVEN LESS UNEASINESS AMONG THE STREET CROWDS THAN THERE HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE A WHOLE CROP OF NEW APPEALS AGAINST INSURRECTION HAD BLOSSOMED OUT ON THE WALLS DURING THE NIGHT TO THE PEASANTS TO THE SOLDIERS AT THE FRONT TO THE WORKMEN OF PETROGRAD
THE WOMEN'S BATTALION IS IN THERE THEY WILL SAY WE HAVE FIRED ON RUSSIAN WOMEN AS WE REACHED THE NEVSKY AGAIN ANOTHER ARMOURED CAR CAME AROUND THE CORNER AND A MAN POKED HIS HEAD OUT OF THE TURRET TOP COME ON
THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS IN MEETING IN SUCH UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY THE TSAY EE KAH CONSIDERS IT UNNECESSARY TO ADDRESS YOU WITH A POLITICAL SPEECH
HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN A TIRED MANNER AND REPLIED TCHORT ZNAYET THE DEVIL KNOWS WELL PERHAPS THE BOLSHEVIKI CAN SEIZE THE POWER BUT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD IT MORE THAN THREE DAYS THEY HAVEN'T THE MEN TO RUN A GOVERNMENT
WE WALKED BACK UP TO THE RED ARCH WHERE A KNOT OF SOLDIERS WAS GATHERED STARING AT THE BRIGHTLY LIGHTED WINTER PALACE AND TALKING IN LOUD TONES NO COMRADES ONE WAS SAYING HOW CAN WE SHOOT AT THEM
PEOPLE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY TOWARD THE CLOUDED WINDOWS AND A SORT OF FEVER CAME OVER THEM MARTOV DEMANDING THE FLOOR CROAKED HOARSELY THE CIVIL WAR IS BEGINNING COMRADES
HENDELMAN FOR THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES COULD BE HEARD PROTESTING AGAINST THE BOMBARDMENT OF THE WINTER PALACE WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS KIND OF ANARCHY SCARCELY HAD HE STEPPED DOWN THAN A YOUNG LEAN FACED SOLDIER
THE LIBERATION OF THE BOLSHEVIKI STILL IN PRISON
SHOUTS AND STAMPING ALWAYS GROWING MORE VIOLENT THE ARMY DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS HAS THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY SOLDIERS BEGAN TO STAND UP ALL OVER THE HALL WHO ARE YOU SPEAKING FOR WHAT DO YOU REPRESENT
AND CALL UPON ALL PUBLIC FORCES TO RESIST THE ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE THE POWER KUTCHIN DELEGATE OF THE TWELFTH ARMY AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TROUDOVIKI I WAS SENT HERE ONLY FOR INFORMATION AND I AM RETURNING AT ONCE TO THE FRONT
HE YELLED LET'S GO ON THROUGH AND ATTACK THE DRIVER OF THE OTHER CAR CAME OVER AND SHOUTED SO AS TO BE HEARD ABOVE THE ROARING ENGINE THE COMMITTEE SAYS TO WAIT THEY HAVE GOT ARTILLERY BEHIND THE WOOD PILES IN THERE
ONE OF THEM SUPPORTED BY TWO COMRADES IT WAS GETTING LATE WHEN WE LEFT THE PALACE THE SENTRIES IN THE SQUARE HAD ALL DISAPPEARED THE GREAT SEMI CIRCLE OF GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS SEEMED DESERTED
THEY CRIED THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE SOVIET OF THE FIFTH ARMY THE SECOND F REGIMENT THE FIRST N REGIMENT THE THIRD S RIFLES WHEN WERE YOU ELECTED YOU REPRESENT THE OFFICERS NOT THE SOLDIERS
BUT NOW THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE OFFICERS ANY MORE BECAUSE OFFICERS WERE VERY UNPOPULAR THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO AS A MATTER OF FACT AND IT WAS PLAIN THAT THEY WERE NOT HAPPY BUT SOON THEY BEGAN TO BOAST
SO WE APPROACHED ANOTHER PART OF THE LINE WITH AN IMPORTANT AIR AND SHOWED OUR AMERICAN PASSPORTS SAYING OFFICIAL BUSINESS AND SHOULDERED THROUGH AT THE DOOR OF THE PALACE THE SAME OLD SHVEITZARI
AND A CORDON OF TROOPS STRETCHED CLEAR ACROSS THE WESTERN END BESIEGED BY AN UNEASY THRONG OF CITIZENS EXCEPT FOR FAR AWAY SOLDIERS WHO SEEMED TO BE CARRYING WOOD OUT OF THE PALACE COURTYARD AND PILING IT IN FRONT OF THE MAIN GATEWAY
WANDERING THROUGH THE DEFENCES OF AN ARMY AWAITING ATTACK HE BEGAN TO COMPLAIN OF THE STATE OF RUSSIA NOT ONLY THESE BOLSHEVIKI HE SAID BUT THE FINE TRADITIONS OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY ARE BROKEN DOWN
WE UNLOCKED THE DOOR JUST INSIDE A COUPLE OF SOLDIERS STOOD ON GUARD BUT THEY SAID NOTHING
THE MASSIVE FACADE OF SMOLNY BLAZED WITH LIGHTS AS WE DROVE UP AND FROM EVERY STREET CONVERGED UPON IT STREAMS OF HURRYING SHAPES DIM IN THE GLOOM
AND THIS WILL MEAN EVERY KIND OF REPRESSION FOR THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS CONTINUATION OF THE WAR INEVITABLE HUNGER AND DEATH OR
FOLLOWED HIM GHARRA WHILE WE ARE HERE DISCUSSING PROPOSITIONS OF PEACE THERE IS A BATTLE ON IN THE STREETS THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE MENSHEVIKI REFUSE TO BE INVOLVED IN WHAT IS HAPPENING
ALSO MORTALLY STRICKEN WHO NEVERTHELESS WOULD RETURN AND POUR OUT HIS BEAUTIFUL ELOQUENCE FOR A LOST CAUSE GOTZ SAT THERE DAN LIEBER BOGDANOV BROIDO FILLIPOVSKY
IN FRONT OF THE STATE BANK SOME SOLDIERS WITH FIXED BAYONETS WERE STANDING AT THE CLOSED GATES WHAT SIDE DO YOU BELONG TO I ASKED THE GOVERNMENT NO MORE GOVERNMENT ONE ANSWERED WITH A GRIN
COMPOSED OF MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL AND WARD DUMAS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FOLLOWING REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATIONS
AND BEHIND THEM CAME MARCHING SOLDIERS AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH WE WENT TOWARD THE WINTER PALACE BY WAY OF THE ADMIRALTEISKY ALL THE ENTRANCES TO THE PALACE SQUARE WERE CLOSED BY SENTRIES
THEN TROTZKY THAT TELEGRAMS HAD BEEN SENT TO THE FRONT ANNOUNCING THE VICTORIOUS INSURRECTION BUT NO REPLY HAD COME TROOPS WERE SAID TO BE MARCHING AGAINST PETROGRAD A DELEGATION MUST BE SENT TO TELL THEM THE TRUTH
AS YOUR SUPERIOR OFFICER AND AS A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC I DEMAND TO BE ALLOWED TO PASS THE GUARD SCRATCHED HIS HEAD LOOKING UNEASILY OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE
FULL OF ARRESTED MEMBERS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT PETERS LETTISH MEMBER OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE CAME HURRYING ACROSS THE SQUARE I THOUGHT YOU BAGGED ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN LAST NIGHT SAID I POINTING TO THEM
THE FIRST QUESTION MUST BE A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF THE CRISIS ON PRINCIPLE AND FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT WE MUST URGENTLY DISCUSS A MEANS OF AVERTING CIVIL WAR
AROUND IN FRONT STOOD A LITTLE GREY MOUSTACHED MAN IN THE UNIFORM OF A GENERAL THE CENTRE OF A KNOT OF SOLDIERS HE WAS VERY RED IN THE FACE I AM GENERAL ALEXEYEV HE CRIED
LAND THE LEADING ARTICLE WAS SIGNED ZINOVIEV LENIN'S COMPANION IN HIDING IT BEGAN EVERY SOLDIER EVERY WORKER EVERY REAL SOCIALIST
WHY IS THE DOOR LOCKED TO KEEP THE SOLDIERS IN HE ANSWERED
ALL RUSSIA HE WAVED HIS HAND DISTRACTEDLY AND RAN OFF RIAZANOV AND KAMENIEV HAD BOTH OPPOSED THE INSURRECTION AND FELT THE LASH OF LENIN'S TERRIBLE TONGUE
THIS WILL BECOME MUCH CLEARER TO YOU IF YOU WILL RECOLLECT THAT I AM A MEMBER OF THE TSAY EE KAH AND THAT AT THIS VERY MOMENT OUR PARTY COMRADES ARE IN THE WINTER PALACE UNDER BOMBARDMENT
EVERY HONEST DEMOCRAT REALISES THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES TO THE PRESENT SITUATION EITHER THE POWER WILL REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF THE BOURGEOIS LANDLORD CREW
IT WILL SUPPRESS IMMEDIATELY THE GREAT LANDED PROPERTY AND TRANSFER THE LAND TO THE PEASANTS IT WILL ESTABLISH WORKMEN'S CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS AND WILL SET UP A GENERAL CONTROL OVER THE BANKS WHICH IT WILL TRANSFORM INTO A STATE MONOPOLY
AND WHEN I SHOWED MY PASS JUST SAID IF YOU WERE SAINT MICHAEL HIMSELF COMRADE YOU COULDN'T PASS HERE THROUGH THE GLASS OF THE DOOR I MADE OUT THE DISTORTED FACE AND GESTICULATING ARMS OF A FRENCH CORRESPONDENT LOCKED IN
HOLDING IN ITS HANDS THE THREADS OF INSURRECTION AND STRIKING WITH A LONG ARM
SEVEN SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES THREE MENSHEVIKI AND ONE INTERNATIONALIST GORKY'S GROUP HENDELMANN FOR THE RIGHT AND CENTRE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES SAID THAT THEY REFUSED TO TAKE PART IN THE PRESIDIUM
AND BULGING PORTFOLIOS UNDER THEIR ARMS THE EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET WAS OVER I STOPPED KAMENIEV A QUICK MOVING LITTLE MAN WITH A WIDE VIVACIOUS FACE SET CLOSE TO HIS SHOULDERS
ORGANISATION OF POWER SECOND WAR AND PEACE AND THIRD THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY LOZOVSKY RISING ANNOUNCED THAT UPON AGREEMENT OF THE BUREAU OF ALL FACTIONS IT WAS PROPOSED TO HEAR AND DISCUSS THE REPORT OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET
THEY WILL COME FROM THAT DIRECTION POINTING TOWARD THE ADMIRALTY WHO WILL THAT I COULDN'T TELL YOU BROTHER HE ANSWERED AND SPAT BEFORE THE DOOR OF THE PALACE WAS A CROWD OF SOLDIERS AND SAILORS
THE ONLY NEWSPAPER WHICH SEEMED ON SALE
THE LETTISH SOLDIERS HAVE MANY TIMES SAID NO MORE RESOLUTIONS NO MORE TALK
THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDIUM TOOK PLACE AMID STIR AND MOVING ABOUT AVANESSOV ANNOUNCED THAT BY AGREEMENT OF THE BOLSHEVIKI LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS
LET CHEAP BOHEMIANS CONSIDER COFFEE THE END IF THEY WOULD
WHAT'S THE USE OF BRAGGING ABOUT BEING FROM THE NORTH OR THE SOUTH OR THE OLD MANOR HOUSE IN THE DALE OR EUCLID AVENUE CLEVELAND OR PIKE'S PEAK OR FAIRFAX COUNTY VIRGINIA OR HOOLIGAN'S FLATS OR ANY PLACE
BUT WHAT MADE THEM DO THEM THEIR EVIL NATURE THEIR BASE SOULS BUT YOU ARE ONE OF THEM I AM ANOTHER YET YOU AND I LIVE HERE TOGETHER AND WE DO NO VICES AND CLIMES HER ASTOUNDING SHREWDNESS
MISSUS MC CASKEY DODGED IN TIME SHE REACHED FOR A FLATIRON WITH WHICH AS A SORT OF CORDIAL SHE HOPED TO BRING THE GASTRONOMICAL DUEL TO A CLOSE BUT A LOUD WAILING SCREAM DOWNSTAIRS CAUSED BOTH HER AND MISTER MC CASKEY
THE ORCHESTRA GLIDED INTO A MEDLEY THE CONCLUDING AIR WAS DIXIE
AT MIDNIGHT THE CAFE WAS CROWDED BY SOME CHANCE THE LITTLE TABLE AT WHICH I SAT HAD ESCAPED THE EYE OF INCOMERS AND TWO VACANT CHAIRS AT IT EXTENDED THEIR ARMS WITH VENAL HOSPITALITY TO THE INFLUX OF PATRONS

I KNOW AN ESQUIMAU IN UPERNAVIK WHO SENDS TO CINCINNATI FOR HIS NECKTIES
THE PARKS WERE GREEN WITH NEW LEAVES AND BUYERS FOR THE WESTERN AND SOUTHERN TRADE FLOWERS AND SUMMER RESORT AGENTS WERE BLOWING THE AIR AND ANSWERS TO LAWSON WERE GROWING MILDER
AND THE MEN AND THE BUTTERFLY FEEL THE SAME AFTER THEY ARE DEAD PRECISELY THE SAME THEY LIE IN A DEEP DROWSE AND DREAM A NONSENSE DREAM THAT IS NOT DLEADFUL
I HEARD YE CAME THE ORAL SUBSTITUTES FOR KITCHENWARE
INQUIRED IMMEDIATELY IF ANYBODY HAD LOOKED BEHIND THE CLOCK MAJOR GRIGG WHO SAT BY HIS FAT WIFE ON THE TOP STEP AROSE AND BUTTONED HIS COAT THE LITTLE ONE LOST HE EXCLAIMED I WILL SCOUR THE CITY HIS WIFE NEVER ALLOWED HIM OUT AFTER DARK

IF SOME MORE MEN WOULD SPLING THEY WOULD BE TAUGHT AH BUT NO MORE MEN WILL SPLING YOU SEE THERE IS NO TELLING I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF THEY MUST AND SHALL THE TLEES BLOSSOM THE THUNDER LOLLS
IT IS WORTH A PARAGRAPH TO SAY THAT THIS REMARKABLE SCENE CAN BE WITNESSED EVERY EVENING IN NUMEROUS CAFES IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK TONS OF BREW HAVE BEEN CONSUMED OVER THEORIES TO ACCOUNT FOR IT SOME HAVE CONJECTURED HASTILY THAT ALL SOUTHERNERS IN TOWN
WE ARE ALL BROTHERS CHINAMEN ENGLISHMEN ZULUS PATAGONIANS AND THE PEOPLE IN THE BEND OF THE KAW RIVER SOME DAY ALL THIS PETTY PRIDE IN ONE'S CITY OR STATE OR SECTION OR COUNTRY WILL BE WIPED OUT

WHY I'VE SEEN KENTUCKIANS WHO HATED WHISKEY VIRGINIANS WHO WEREN'T DESCENDED FROM POCAHONTAS INDIANIANS WHO HADN'T WRITTEN A NOVEL MEXICANS WHO DIDN'T WEAR VELVET TROUSERS WITH SILVER DOLLARS SEWED ALONG THE SEAMS
THE SEDULOUS AND LARGESS LOVING GARCONS THE MUSIC WISELY CATERING TO ALL WITH ITS RAIDS UPON THE COMPOSERS
YOU MIGHT TESTIFY THAT I HAD REGAINED MY REPUTATION REDEEMED MY CHARACTER THAT I HAD PROVED TO YOUR ENTIRE SATISFACTION THAT I WAS THE MAGICIAN I CLAIMED TO BE
APPARENTLY AT A LOSS FOR WORDS WITH WHICH TO COMMENT UPON THE PAPER HE HAD READ THE GOVERNOR HANDED IT TO THE INSPECTOR THE MAJOR SHRANK FROM TAKING IT I I'D RATHER NOT HE MUMBLED I THINK YOU HAD BETTER READ IT
HELD IN A DIMLY LIGHTED PLACE OF WORSHIP THE CONGREGATION GAVE A RESPECTFUL HEARING FOR NEARLY TEN MINUTES TO A JACKDAW FROM WAPPING UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE LISTENING TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER
WHICH UNFITTED THEM FOR FURTHER SERVICE IN THE SUFFRAGETTE CAUSE SOME OF THE GREEN ONES WERE SECURED BY ARDENT HOME RULE PROPAGANDISTS AND TRAINED TO DISTURB THE SERENITY OF ORANGE MEETINGS
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS GOOD AND EVIL I KNOW THAT FOR CAUSES WHICH ARE HIDDEN FROM ME THE ALMIGHTY MAY PERMIT EVIL TO TAKE VISIBLE SHAPE AND WALK ABROAD UPON THE EARTH
WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO CONTINUE THE GOVERNOR INTERPOSED I THINK MISTER HEWETT IF YOU WILL PERMIT ME MANKELL I AM NOT A CLERGYMAN THE PRISONER'S SMILE ALMOST DEGENERATED INTO A GRIN
I SHOULD CONVEY IT TO COLONEL GREGORY INDEED IN THAT CASE HE WOULD HAVE AS HIGH AN OPINION OF OUR CHARACTERS AS OF YOURS AND YOURSELF WHAT SORT OF ACTION MIGHT WE EXPECT FROM YOU
IN DISTRUSTING HIS MAGIC POWERS AND SO CASTING A STAIN UPON HIS CHARACTER THIS IS TO TESTIFY THAT HE HAS PROVED TO THE ENTIRE SATISFACTION OF THE UNDERSIGNED INSPECTOR OF PRISONS
THERE IS ONE SUGGESTION I MIGHT OFFER LET'S HAVE IT BY ALL MEANS WE HAVE REACHED A POINT AT WHICH WE SHALL BE GLAD TO RECEIVE ANY SUGGESTION FROM YOU YOU MIGHT GIVE ME A TESTIMONIAL
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN BUYING UP BUILDING SITES IN COMMANDING SITUATIONS IN AND AROUND THE METROPOLIS TWO OR THREE I'M TOLD ARE ON THE ROAD TO BRIGHTON AND ANOTHER NEAR ASCOT YOU DON'T MEAN TO FORTIFY THEM DO YOU
OLIVER MANKELL SENTENCED BY COLONEL GREGORY TO THREE MONTHS HARD LABOUR HAS BEEN IN CANTERSTONE JAIL TWO DAYS THAT SHORT SPACE OF TIME HAS HOWEVER CONVINCED THEM THAT COLONEL GREGORY ACTED WRONGLY
THE END WILL NOT BE LONG THE PRISONER SEEMED LOST IN REFLECTION THE OFFICIALS SEEMED LOST IN REFLECTION TOO BUT THEIR REFLECTIONS WERE PROBABLY OF A DIFFERENT KIND
WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN THE MAJOR HE ADDED GOVERNOR OF HIS OWN ACCORD NOW DOCTOR IT IS YOU THE DOCTOR THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS TROUSERS POCKETS I'LL SIGN IF YOU'LL TELL ME HOW IT IS DONE
AND OFFICIALS OF CANTERSTONE JAIL THAT HE IS A MAGICIAN OF QUITE THE HIGHEST CLASS THE SIGNATURES OF ALL THOSE PRESENT SHOULD BE PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OBSERVED THE PRISONER AS THE GOVERNOR WAS READING THE TESTIMONIAL
OH SIR I HAVE STILL NEARLY THE WHOLE THREE MONTHS IN FRONT OF ME UNTIL MY TERM EXPIRES I SHALL GO ON WITH GATHERING STRENGTH UNTO THE END
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU SUSPECT ME OF HANKY PANKY YES SIR I WILL SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE IF YOU WISH IT YOU SHALL BE TORN ASUNDER WHERE YOU STAND
SINCE OUT OF SIGHT MEANT ALSO OUT OF REACH ALTOGETHER IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND POPULAR EXHIBITIONS THAT THE ACADEMY HAD HELD FOR MANY YEARS THEN THE FAIR AGITATORS FELL BACK ON SOME OF THEIR EARLIER METHODS
I ALWAYS PLACED A LITERAL INTERPRETATION ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH CHAPTER OF THE FIRST BOOK OF SAMUEL IT IS SINGULAR HOW MY FAITH IS JUSTIFIED
TO KNOW IF SUCH AN APPLICATION HAS EVER BEEN MADE TO THE GOVERNOR OF AN ENGLISH JAIL BEFORE WHAT DO YOU SAY HARDINGE THE MAJOR SHUFFLED IN HIS CHAIR I I THINK I MUST RETURN TO TOWN THE PRISONER SMILED THE MAJOR WINCED
THEY HAVE REFUSED US THE VOTE SAID LENA BITTERLY THE PRIME MINISTER ALWAYS DECLARED HIMSELF AN OPPONENT OF ANYTHING SAVOURING OF PANIC LEGISLATION BUT HE BROUGHT A BILL INTO PARLIAMENT FORTHWITH
SHOULD HEAD THE LIST I I I'D RATHER SOMEBODY ELSE SIGNED FIRST THAT WOULD NEVER DO IT IS FOR YOU TO LEAD THE VAN YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE YOUR SEAT THE MAJOR LEFT HIS SEAT
ARE THE PRODUCT OF MOMENTS OF LEGISLATIVE PANIC TAKE FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC REFORMS THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED THROUGH PARLIAMENT IN THE LIFETIME OF THIS GENERATION IT HAPPENED SHORTLY AFTER THE COAL STRIKE
THE MAGISTRATE TENDERED ME WHAT
TELL YOU HOW IT IS DONE HOW WHAT IS DONE HOW YOU DO THAT HANKY PANKY OF COURSE HANKY PANKY THE PRISONER DREW HIMSELF STRAIGHT UP
THEY WROTE SWEETLY ARGUMENTATIVE PLAYS TO PROVE THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE THE VOTE THEY SMASHED WINDOWS TO SHOW THAT THEY MUST HAVE THE VOTE AND THEY KICKED CABINET MINISTERS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY'D BETTER HAVE THE VOTE AND STILL
A CONTINUATION OF THAT SILENCE WHICH HAD PREVAILED UNTIL HE CAME THE GOVERNOR FUMBLED WITH A PAPER KNIFE WHICH WAS IN FRONT OF HIM THE INSPECTOR LEANING FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR
WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO WITH IT NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW NOT EVEN THOSE WHO WERE MOST ACTIVE IN COLLECTING WORK THE SECRET ON THIS OCCASION HAD BEEN WELL KEPT CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT LEAKED OUT FROM TIME TO TIME
BUT IMAGINE WHAT LIFE WOULD BE LIKE IF ONE SAW THAT ERECTION CONFRONTING ONE WHEREVER ONE WENT IMAGINE THE EFFECT ON PEOPLE WITH TIRED HARASSED NERVES WHO SAW IT THREE TIMES ON THE WAY TO BRIGHTON AND THREE TIMES ON THE WAY BACK
IN A BEAUTIFULLY FAIR ROUND HAND AS CLEAR AS COPPERPLATE THE FOLLOWING TESTIMONIAL THE UNDERSIGNED PERSONS PRESENT THEIR COMPLIMENTS TO COLONEL GREGORY
WHAT ADVICE WAS THAT HE SAID I CLAIMED TO BE A MAGICIAN HE ADVISED ME FOR MY CHARACTER'S SAKE TO PROVE IT DURING MY SOJOURN HERE I SEE AND
WHO HAD LATELY RETURNED FROM A MUCH ENLIVENED EXILE IN THE WILDS OF MEXICO
THE GOVERNOR LEANED BACK IN HIS SEAT YOUR SUGGESTION HAS AT LEAST THE FORCE OF NOVELTY I SHOULD LIKE TO SEARCH THE REGISTERS OF REMARKABLE CASES
AND SUCCESSFULLY APPEALED TO BOTH HOUSES TO PASS IT THROUGH ALL ITS STAGES WITHIN THE WEEK AND THAT IS HOW WE GOT ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS MEASURES OF THE CENTURY
APPARENTLY NOT REJOICING IN HIS FREEDOM HE WROTE WILLIAM HARDINGE IN GREAT SPRAWLING CHARACTERS ADD INSPECTOR OF PRISONS
THE MAJOR ADDED INSPECTOR OF PRISONS WITH A VERY RUEFUL COUNTENANCE MISTER PALEY IT IS YOUR TURN MISTER PALEY TOOK HIS TURN WITH A REALLY TOLERABLE IMITATION OF BEING BOTH READY AND WILLING
SAID THE GOVERNOR THUS URGED THE MAJOR DID READ IT GOOD LORD HE GASPED AND PASSED IT TO THE DOCTOR THE DOCTOR SILENTLY HAVING READ IT PASSED IT TO THE CHAPLAIN I WILL READ IT ALOUD
IN DEVISING AND PUTTING INTO ACTION NEW METHODS FOR ACCOMPLISHING THEIR ENDS AS A RULE THEY WERE A NUISANCE AND A WEARINESS TO THE FLESH BUT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THEY VERGED ON THE PICTURESQUE
OH SIR OF WHAT VALUE IS A TESTIMONIAL WHICH IS NOT VOLUNTARY QUITE SO
WALDO ORPINGTON IS A FRIVOLOUS LITTLE FOOL WHO CHIRRUPS AT DRAWING ROOM CONCERTS AND CAN RECOGNISE BITS FROM DIFFERENT COMPOSERS WITHOUT REFERRING TO THE PROGRAMME BUT ALL THE SAME HE OCCASIONALLY HAS IDEAS
FOR MY CHARACTER'S SAKE I AM BUT BEGINNING YOU PERCEIVE OH YOU'RE BUT BEGINNING YOU CALL THIS BUT BEGINNING DO YOU MAY I ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY INTENTION OF GOING ON
OF UNBLESSED MEMORY TO YOU WHO HAVE BEEN PLUNGED UP TO THE NECK IN EVENTS OF A MORE TANGLED AND TUMBLED DESCRIPTION THE THINGS I AM GOING TO TELL YOU OF MAY SEEM OF SECONDARY INTEREST
WE'VE BEEN DOING NOTHING ELSE FOR MONTHS SHE SAID WALDO SHOOK HIS HEAD AND CONTINUED TO LOOK WESTWARD ALONG THE MALL HE'S RATHER GOOD AT ACTING IN AN AMATEUR SORT OF FASHION LENA FOLLOWED HIS GAZE
AND THE DRASTIC WEEDING OUT OF A FEW HUNDRED CANVASES WAS REGARDED AS A POSITIVE IMPROVEMENT MOREOVER FROM THE ARTISTS POINT OF VIEW IT WAS REALISED THAT THE OUTRAGE CONSTITUTED A SORT OF COMPENSATION FOR THOSE WHOSE WORKS
THE CRITICISM SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN EXTRACTED FROM THE GOVERNOR ALMOST AGAINST HIS WILL HE LOOKED ROUND UPON HIS COLLEAGUES WITH WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A GHASTLY GRIN
THEY ASSEMBLED IN FORCE ON THE OPENING DAY OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY EXHIBITION AND DESTROYED SOME THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED OF THE PICTURES THIS PROVED AN EVEN WORSE FAILURE THAN THE PARROT BUSINESS
I HAVE SENT FOR YOU FOR THE SECOND TIME THIS MORNING TO ASK YOU FRANKLY IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO COMPLAIN OF YOUR TREATMENT HERE THE PRISONER STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS WITH HIS FAMILIAR GESTURE HAVE YOU ANY
I WAS HOPING YOU WERE GOING TO TRY A LITTLE PERSONAL BRIBERY HE RESPONDED BANTERINGLY BUT SOME GENUINE ANXIETY AND CURIOSITY LAY BEHIND THE LIGHTNESS OF HIS CHAFF OF COURSE I KNOW HE ADDED
THE SAME PHENOMENON WAS OBSERVABLE IN THE CHIEF WARDER WHO FOLLOWED CLOSE UPON THE PRISONER'S HEELS MANKELL SEEMED AS EVER COMPLETELY AT HIS EASE
THAT THAT FELLOW'S PINNED ME TO MY CHAIR HE GASPED HE APPEARED TO BE MAKING FUTILE EFFORTS TO RISE FROM HIS SEAT YOU CANNOT RETURN TO TOWN DISMISS THE IDEA FROM YOUR MIND
THE CHAPLAIN WAS HOLDING THE TESTIMONIAL LOOSELY BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB STRETCHING OUT HIS ARM MANKELL POINTED AT IT WITH HIS HAND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY IN FLAMES THE CHAPLAIN RELEASING IT
WE WILL THINK THE MATTER OVER THE PRISONER DROPPED HIS HANDS TO HIS SIDES LOOKING THE GOVERNOR STEADILY IN THE FACE SIR I CONCEIVE THAT ANSWER TO CONVEY A NEGATIVE
YOUR CHARACTER WHAT DO YOU MEAN IN THE FIRST INTERVIEW WITH WHICH YOU FAVOURED ME I VENTURED TO OBSERVE THAT IT WOULD BE MY ENDEAVOUR DURING MY SOJOURN WITHIN THESE WALLS TO ACT UPON THE ADVICE
TOWARDS THE SETTING SUN AND BUCKINGHAM PALACE HE WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID SIGNIFICANTLY YOU HAVE EXPENDED YOUR ENERGIES AND ENTERPRISE ON LABOURS OF DESTRUCTION
WHEN LENA GAVE A RATHER GLOOMY ACCOUNT OF THE EXISTING STATE OF THINGS IN THE SUFFRAGETTE WORLD WALDO WAS NOT MERELY SYMPATHETIC BUT READY WITH A PRACTICAL SUGGESTION TURNING HIS GAZE WESTWARD ALONG THE MALL
ON THE DAY WHEN I FIRST PUT THE RING ON HER FINGER CELIA SWORE AN OATH THAT NOTHING BUT DEATH EXTREME POVERTY OR BRIGANDS SHOULD EVER REMOVE IT I SWORE TOO UNFORTUNATELY
THERE'S NOTHING SAID CELIA IN THE SAME MOURNFUL VOICE I DO THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE PUT SOMETHING I WENT AND SAT ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND HELD THE RING UP YOU'RE AN UNGRATEFUL WIFE I SAID
THERE CAN'T BE MUCH ELSE UNLESS PERHAPS SHE HAS A VERY LARGE FINGER WELL I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING IN MINE SAID CELIA MOURNFULLY SHE TOOK OFF THE OFFENDING RING AND GAVE IT TO ME
AND GENERAL CONVERSATION SEEMED OUT OF THE QUESTION SO I TRIED ANOTHER LINE
ONLY THE CHILDREN BELIEVED IN THE LAUGHING OLD MAN WITH THE STRANGE WHEEL RAINBOWS MOCKED THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS RAINBOWS MUCH GOOD ARE RAINBOWS TO A STARVING VILLAGE THE OLD MAKER OF RAINBOWS TOOK THEIR TAUNTS IN SILENCE
I QUITE PERCEIVE THAT I MADE A MISTAKE IN ADMINISTERING THE DOSE AFTER DINNER IN FACT I AM MYSELF INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT I MISUNDERSTOOD HUGHES
AND DARKNESS IS LIGHT MISUNDERSTOOD THE SAD HEART MAKES ITS OWN SORROW THE HAPPY HEART MAKES ITS OWN JOY THE HARVEST IS MADE BY THE HARVESTMAN AND THERE IS NOTHING HARD OR BLACK OR WEARY THAT IS NOT WAITING FOR THE MAGIC TOUCH
AH IT IS TO THE AFTER EFFECTS WE MUST LOOK FORWARD IT IS THE AFTER EFFECTS I'M THINKING OF SAID PYBUS THAT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN I COULD BEAR IT WAS THE AFTER EFFECTS I WAS THINKING OF AS WELL COME LET'S ADJOURN AND HAVE A LITTLE MUSIC
AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE I TOOK NOW LOOK THERE AND I POINTED WITH A PENCIL WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU SEE TWENTY TWO THAT'S ONLY THE THAT WAS YOUR AGE WHEN YOU MARRIED ME
AND THE LEAN WHEAT FIELDS AND THE RAGGED ORCHARDS HAD BEEN LEANER AND MORE RAGGED THAN EVER BEFORE SO SAID THE MEMORY OF THE OLDEST VILLAGERS THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TO EAT IN THE VILLAGE OF TWELVE TREES AND PRACTICALLY NO MONEY AT ALL
WHICH SEEMED TO BREAK THE SPELL SOMEHOW
I SAW THAT I MUST EXPLAIN IT TO HER AFTER ALL THERE WAS A DISTINGUISHED PRECEDENT COME INTO THE BATH ROOM A MOMENT I SAID AND I LED THE WAY SHE FOLLOWED WONDERING
EVEN THE HEART OF CHILDHOOD FELT THE SHADOWS THAT NOVEMBER MORNING IN THE DREARY LITTLE VILLAGE OF TWELVE TREES
AND HE TOUCHED THE CHILD'S FACE WITH HIS HAND AND CAUGHT ONE OF HER TEARS ON HIS FINGER AND PLACED IT GLITTERING ON HIS WHEEL THEN WORKING A PEDAL WITH HIS FOOT THE WHEEL BEGAN TO MOVE SO SWIFTLY
THIS WAS HARD COMING FROM MARGARET MY DEAR MARGARET THE NAME IS HALF THE BATTLE HUGHES THINKS IT'S A SPLENDID ONE BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT MAKES ONE THINK OF INDIGESTION THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S MEANT TO DO BEFORE OR AFTERWARDS
SHE HERSELF SWEARS BY SOME NOXIOUS COMPOUND WHICH IS ABSURDLY NAMED DADDY'S DELIGHT AND WHICH I KNOW BY THE MERE SMELL OF IT IS NOTHING ELSE BUT POISON HAVE YOU ANY OF THE STUFF IN THE HOUSE SHE ASKED
AND MOVED ABOUT WITH A DANK HOPELESSNESS EVIDENTLY EXPECTING NOTHING IN THE SHAPE OF DISCARDED FISH OR TRANSFIGURING SMELLS THERE WAS NO LIFE IN THE LONG DISHEVELED HIGH STREET
HE PAUSED LOOKING ME FIXEDLY IN THE FACE ALL GENUINE THAT EVENING I HAD A SMALL DINNER PARTY IT WAS RATHER AN OCCASION THE SUGGESTION I AM BOUND TO ADMIT HAD COME FROM MARGARET
AND THAT'S WHAT I HAD ENGRAVED ON IT VERY WELL NOW WHAT DO YOU SEE NEXT TO IT A CROWN YES AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN THE LANGUAGE OF ER CROWNS IT MEANS YOU ARE MY QUEEN
YOU MUST BE OF THE DEVIL
WON'T PRESS A LONGING HAND TO HER INSIDE OUTSIDE I PRESUME YOU MEAN BUT NO MATTER HUGHES PLACED THE BOTTLE ON THE TABLE HE LOOKED AT IT WITH LOVING EYES THEN HE SHOOK HIS HEAD THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WE WANT CUSTOMERS
BUT OF COURSE WE SHOULD BOTH OF US SEE THAT SHE MADE A GOOD THING OF IT WHEN THE SALE GOT UP I NEED SCARCELY OBSERVE WHAT FORTUNES HAVE BEEN MADE IN PATENT MEDICINES AND LOST IN THEM MY BOY
IN THE SMALL SPACE ALLOTTED TO HIM THE SCULPTOR HAS HARDLY DONE ME JUSTICE AND THERE I ADDED IS HIS INITIAL R OH WOMAN THE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT I SPENT ON THAT RING
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WITHOUT A TREMOR BUT OF COURSE YOU SHALL PUT JUST WHATEVER YOU LIKE ONLY ONLY LET IT BE ORIGINAL NOT MIZPAHS RIGHT I SAID
I INSISTED ON A CROWN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEAPER TO HAVE HAD A LION WHICH MEANS ER LIONS BUT I WAS DETERMINED NOT TO SPARE MYSELF FOR I THOUGHT I WENT ON PATHETICALLY I QUITE THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE A CROWN
I HESITATED I ER WELL LADIES OFTEN LIKE THE DATE PUT IN WHEN IS IT TO BE
WERE AS FULL OF LAUGHTER AS A BOY'S HIS CRY ATTRACTED A WEARY FACE HERE AND THERE AT WINDOW AND DOOR BUT SEEING NOTHING BUT AN OLD KNIFE GRINDER THE FACES LOST INTEREST AND IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED
MARGARET A GLASS OF AUNT JANE'S JALAP BUT GEORGE I ASSURE YOU THAT I NEVER DO TAKE MEDICINE SOME PEOPLE'S WINE IS NO BETTER THAN MEDICINE WE DRINK THAT AND PRETEND WE LIKE IT WHY NOT JALAP
AND CELIA HAD BEEN CALLING ON ERMYNTRUDE I HOPE YOU DID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS I SAID ASKED TO SEE THE WEDDING RING AND ADMIRED THE CHARMING LITTLE HOUSE
BUT THIS WAS NO COMFORT TO THE GAUNT AND SHIVERING CHILDREN LEFT TO THEMSELVES ON THE CHILL DOOR STEPS HALF HEARTEDLY TRYING TO PLAY THEIR INNOCENT LITTLE GAMES
AND IN ITS RADIANCE SHE BECAME STRANGELY TRANSFIGURED IN PLACE OF CRAZY SAL WHOM THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO MOCK THE CHILDREN SAW A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL ALL BLUSHES AND BRIGHT EYES AND PRETTY RIBBONS
GOOD GOD PYBUS I CAN'T HELP IT I REALLY CANNOT HELP IT SIR THE IDEA OF A REASONABLE PERSON VOLUNTARILY SWALLOWING SUCH A CONCOCTION AS THAT BEFORE HIS DINNER IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY MAN PROFANE
THE BLANK NOTHINGNESS OF THE DAMP DESERTED STREET THERE WAS TO BE SEEN APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTH A CURIOUS LITTLE FIGURE OF AN OLD MAN TRUNDLING AT HIS SIDE A STRANGE APPARATUS RESEMBLING A KNIFE GRINDER'S WHEEL
HOW MUCH DID HE GIVE HER FOR IT HALF A CROWN
THE WEDDING HE SMILED IT HAS BEEN I SAID IT'S ALL OVER YOU'RE TOO LATE FOR IT I GAVE MYSELF UP TO THOUGHT AT ALL COSTS I MUST BE ORIGINAL THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ON CELIA'S WEDDING RING
HAVE YOU TRIED THE STUFF UPON YOURSELF
I TOOK IT FROM HER AND LOOKED INSIDE THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS HERE TOO I SAID REALLY YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE READ YOUR WEDDING RING AT ALL OR ANYHOW YOU'VE BEEN SKIPPING
IF IT REALLY MEANS THAT SHE TOOK THE RING IN HER HANDS AND LOOKED AT IT LOVINGLY AND WHAT'S THAT THERE SORT OF A MAN'S HEAD I GAZED AT HER SADLY YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE IT
BUT I SHOULD PREFER TO BE SENTIMENTAL IN SOME OTHER LANGUAGE THAN PLAIN ENGLISH I COULD ORDER CARS SPOSA
THE BATH MAT SHE SAID SURPRISED AND WHAT IS WRITTEN ON IT
THE OBVIOUS CELIA HAD BEEN CALLING ON A NEWLY MARRIED FRIEND OF HERS THEY HAD BEEN SCHOOLGIRLS TOGETHER THEY HAD LOOKED OVER THE SAME ALGEBRA BOOK
SHE SNIFFED AT IT IT HAS A VERY DISAGREEABLE SMELL THAT WAS GOOD I PROTEST THAT I HAVE SMELT DADDY'S DELIGHT WHEN I WAS PASSING THE HOUSE AND TOOK IT TILL I KNEW BETTER FOR DRAINS
SQUARE IT OFF I SUSPECT SHE MEANT
I WISHED I HAD SAMPLED IT BEFORE AS IT WAS IT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE

PYBUS THINKS HE CAN SING HE MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ONCE HERE'S DRINK TO ME ONLY THAT'S A FAVOURITE OF YOURS YOU SHOULD HEAR HIM SING IT MARGARET WILL PLAY THE ACCOMPANIMENT LUCAS HE SAID
AND THE FACES OF THE CHILDREN WERE ALL LAUGHTER AGAIN WELL LITTLE ONE HE SAID WHEN THE WHEEL STOPPED WHIRLING DID YOU LIKE WHAT I MADE OUT OF THAT SAD LITTLE TEAR AND THE CHILDREN LAUGHED AND BEGGED HIM TO DO SOME OTHER TRICK FOR THEM
AND SET OUT TO ACCOMPANY THE OLD VISITOR BUT WHEN THEY REACHED THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE VILLAGE THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM HE HAD MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED
WITH THE HEARTLESSNESS OF YOUNG UNKNOWING THINGS
IF FOR THEM THEN WHAT FOR US WE SHAN'T WANT MORE BOTTLES THAN WE CAN SELL BESIDES WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN BOTTLES IF IT COMES TO THAT COST OF BOTTLE CONTENTS CORK LABEL AND ALL ONE PENNY SELLING PRICE EIGHTPENCE
WE ALL STOOD UP I DRAINED MY GLASS I IMMEDIATELY WISHED I HADN'T THE OTHERS DRAINED THEIR GLASSES I SAW THEY WISHED THEY HADN'T TOO I DO NOT THINK I EVER TASTED ANYTHING QUITE SO NASTY
SUFFICIENT I TRUST TO BRING THE MATTER BEFORE THE PUBLIC EYE
I HAD IT PUT IN AT ENORMOUS EXPENSE IF YOU HAD BEEN EIGHTEEN THE MAN SAID OR OR NINE IT WOULD HAVE COME MUCH CHEAPER BUT NO I WOULD HAVE YOUR EXACT AGE YOU WERE TWENTY TWO
THAT WE DRINK TO ITS SUCCESS I PROPOSE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT WE DRINK TO AUNT JANE'S JALAP IN AUNT JANE'S JALAP BROOKS BRING FOUR CLARET GLASSES I DREW THE CORK
FROM THE SHOPMAN HE WOULDN'T MIND BESIDES IF HE SAW US TOGETHER HE'D PROBABLY KNOW YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF A GOLDSMITH ARE YOU
HOW THE HABIT OF TAKING PATENT MEDICINES WAS WORSE THAN THE HABIT OF DRAM DRINKING
ARE YOU A WIZARD THAT YOU CHANGE A CHILD'S TEARS INTO LAUGHTER
MARGARET MURMURED MISSUS CHALMERS LET'S GO HOME WHY AUNT IT WILL PASS OFF IN TIME IN TIME AT THAT MOMENT I HEARTILY WISHED THAT HUGHES HAD BEEN AT JERICHO BEFORE HE INDUCED ME TO DABBLE IN HIS PATENT MEDICINES
AND THE BOUGHS DRIPPED WITH A CLAMMY MOISTURE THAT HAD NOTHING OF THE ENERGY OF TEARS TWELVE TREES WAS A POOR LITTLE VILLAGE AT THE BEST OF TIMES BUT THE PAST SUMMER HAD BEEN MORE THAN USUALLY UNKIND TO IT
SHE CAME A LITTLE CLOSER AND SLIPPED THE RING ON MY FINGER SPEND A LITTLE MORE SHE PLEADED THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM JUST HAVE SOMETHING NICE WRITTEN IN IT SOMETHING ABOUT YOU AND ME LIKE PISGAH
I'M EVER SO MUCH OLDER NOW TALKING ABOUT WEDDING RINGS SHE WENT ON AS SHE TWISTED HER OWN ROUND AND ROUND SHE'S GOT ALL SORTS OF THINGS WRITTEN INSIDE HERS THE DATE AND THEIR INITIALS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
THAT WOULD BE A LOVELY THING SHE SAID CLASPING HER HANDS EAGERLY WHAT I LOVE YOU CELIA I LOOKED AT HER AGHAST DO YOU WANT ME TO ORDER THAT IN COLD BLOOD
OF THE NEW SERVICE MADAME OR OF THAT WHICH M DE BELLIERE PRESENTED TO YOU ON YOUR MARRIAGE FOR I HAVE FURNISHED BOTH FIRST OF ALL THE NEW ONE THE COVERS THE GOBLETS AND THE DISHES WITH THEIR COVERS THE EAU EPERGNE THE ICE PAILS
THAT IS THE VERY THING I ASK THEY COULD BE SOLD THEN ALL YOUR JEWELS COULD BE SOLD MADAME IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT YOU POSSESS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JEWELS IN PARIS YOU ARE NOT CHANGEABLE IN YOUR TASTES WHEN YOU MAKE A PURCHASE IT IS OF THE VERY BEST AND WHAT YOU PURCHASE YOU DO NOT PART WITH
NOW DON'T SAY THAT SAID OLD ANTHONY SHOCKED
TREASON THEN DEEP MENACES CONCEALED UNDER THE SEMBLANCE OF PUBLIC INTEREST SUCH WERE COLBERT'S MANEUVERS A DETESTABLE DELIGHT AT AN APPROACHING DOWNFALL UNTIRING EFFORTS TO ATTAIN THIS OBJECT MEANS OF SEDUCTION NO LESS WICKED THAN THE CRIME ITSELF
I'M NEARLY AS IMPOLITE AND DISAGREEABLE AND ILL MANNERED AS THESE TWO OLD KNICKERBOCKER GENTS ON EACH SIDE OF ME THAT CAN'T SLEEP OF NIGHTS BECAUSE I BOUGHT IN BETWEEN EM THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT MONEY CAN'T ACCOMPLISH REMARKED YOUNG ROCKWALL RATHER GLOOMILY
DEMANDED OLD ANTHONY SHE'LL JUMP AT YOU YOU'VE GOT THE MONEY AND THE LOOKS AND YOU'RE A DECENT BOY YOUR HANDS ARE CLEAN YOU'VE GOT NO EUREKA SOAP ON EM YOU'VE BEEN TO COLLEGE BUT SHE'LL OVERLOOK THAT I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE SAID RICHARD MAKE ONE SAID ANTHONY
BUT WHEN HE SET FORTH AGAIN ONE OF THEM SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND SENT AN ARROW AFTER HIM WHEREUPON ROBIN TURNED LIKE A FLASH AND MADE EVEN A BETTER SHOT THAN HIS FIRST ONE FOR THE FELLOW WHO HAD LOOSED HIS BOW UPON HIM LAY DEAD ON THE GREENSWARD WITH AN ARROW IN HIS HEART
IS EVERYTHING PREPARED FOR MY DEPARTURE
AND TAXING THEM SO HEAVILY THAT THEY FREQUENTLY STARVED TO DEATH FORESTS WERE PLENTIFUL IN ENGLAND IN THOSE DAYS BUT JOHN OFTEN TORE DOWN HOUSES OF HIS SUBJECTS TO MAKE THE FORESTS EVEN GREATER SO THAT HE MIGHT HAVE MORE SPORT IN HUNTING THE DEER AND THE BOAR THAT RAN WILD THERE
WITH THE LAST OF HIS STRENGTH THE DYING OUTLAW BLEW HIS HORN THAT CALLED HIS FOLLOWERS AROUND HIM
WE DRIVE DOWN BROADWAY TO WALLACK'S AT A GALLOP
AND THE DEEDS OF ROBIN HOOD WERE SOON BROUGHT TO HIS NOTICE HE SOUGHT MORE THAN ONCE TO CAPTURE THE BOLD OUTLAW BUT ALWAYS FAILED AND HE WAS SO CLUMSY AND SO COWARDLY THAT ROBIN HOOD BECAME EMBOLDENED TO DEFY HIM OPENLY AND ENTER THE TOWN OF NOTTINGHAM UNDER HIS VERY EYES
HE RETURNED TO HIS OLD HAUNTS HOWEVER AND AGAIN BECAME AN OUTLAW WHEN KING RICHARD DIED AND THE WICKED JOHN CAME TO THE THRONE ONCE MORE ONE DAY ROBIN HOOD WAS STRICKEN WITH A FEVER AND HE WENT TO A WOMAN WHO LIVED NEARBY TO BE BLED WHICH HE BELIEVED WOULD LESSEN HIS PAIN AND CURE HIS SICKNESS
ALL YOUR GOLD CANNOT BRING HAPPINESS TO YOUR SON AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT EVENING
THEY WON'T GET THIS JUMBLE LOOSENED UP IN AN HOUR
AND HIS FAME AS AN OUTLAW SOON BECAME KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE LAND BUT ALTHOUGH ROBIN HOOD WAS A ROBBER THE COMMON PEOPLE SOON LEARNED TO LOVE HIM FOR NO POOR MAN WAS EVER THE POORER ON ACCOUNT OF HIS OUTLAWRY RATHER WERE THE COUNTRYFOLK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SHERWOOD FOREST BETTER OFF THAN BEFORE
ON ANOTHER OCCASION ROBIN AND HIS BAND MARRIED TWO LOVERS WHO HAD BEEN FORCED TO PART BECAUSE THE MAIDEN'S FATHER HAD DETERMINED THAT SHE WAS TO BECOME THE BRIDE OF A WICKED BUT WEALTHY OLD NOBLEMAN THE OUTLAWS SURROUNDED THE CHAPEL IN WHICH THE WEDDING WAS TO TAKE PLACE AND WHEN THE CEREMONY WAS BEGUN
SAYING THAT WHERE THE ARROW FELL HE DESIRED TO BE BURIED BENDING THE BOW WITH THE LAST OF HIS POWER HE LET LOOSE THE ARROW WHICH FLEW OUT OF THE WINDOW AND STRUCK THE GROUND BESIDE A LITTLE PATH AT THE EDGE OF THE GREENWOOD
DISCLOSED HIMSELF AS NO OTHER THAN ROBIN'S OWN NEPHEW WILL SCARLET WHOM THE OUTLAW HAD NOT SEEN SINCE HE WAS A BABY DELIGHTED AT THE MEETING WILL SCARLET LITTLE JOHN AND ROBIN HOOD MADE HASTE TO JOIN THE REST OF THE BAND BENEATH THE GREENWOOD TREE
SAID RICHARD LOYALLY THEY WHIRLED UP FORTY SECOND TO BROADWAY AND THEN DOWN THE WHITE STARRED LANE THAT LEADS FROM THE SOFT MEADOWS OF SUNSET TO THE ROCKY HILLS OF MORNING AT THIRTY FOURTH STREET YOUNG RICHARD QUICKLY THRUST UP THE TRAP AND ORDERED THE CABMAN TO STOP
I'M FOR MONEY AGAINST THE FIELD TELL ME SOMETHING MONEY WON'T BUY FOR ONE THING ANSWERED RICHARD RANKLING A LITTLE IT WON'T BUY ONE INTO THE EXCLUSIVE CIRCLES OF SOCIETY
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT SOMEBODY TAPPED LIGHTLY ON ANTHONY ROCKWALL'S DOOR
OHO WON'T IT THUNDERED THE CHAMPION OF THE ROOT OF EVIL YOU TELL ME WHERE YOUR EXCLUSIVE CIRCLES WOULD BE IF THE FIRST ASTOR HADN'T HAD THE MONEY TO PAY FOR HIS STEERAGE PASSAGE OVER RICHARD SIGHED
DOUBLY STUNNED FROM THE FORCE WITH WHICH HE HAD HIT THE EARTH THE OUTLAWS WERE AMAZED WHEN THEY SAW WHAT HAD BEFALLEN THEIR LEADER STILL MORE SO WHEN A BAND OF THE KING'S HORSEMEN RODE UP AND SURROUNDED THEM AND CALLED THE MONK WHO HAD SO LATELY BEEN FEASTING WITH THEM YOUR MAJESTY THEN RICHARD TOOK OFF HIS MONK'S DRESS
VERY MUCH SO MADAME
THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY HUSBAND YES MADAME THERE IS LESS WORKMANSHIP IN THAT THAN IN THE OTHER ITS INTRINSIC VALUE DOES NOT EXCEED THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS THIRTY THOUSAND MURMURED THE MARQUISE BUT M FAUCHEUX
ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY
AND APPEARED IN HIS OWN ROYAL GARMENTS HE GAVE THE OUTLAWS A FREE PARDON ON CONDITION THAT THEY SERVE WITH HIM THENCEFORWARD AND BE ARCHERS IN HIS ARMY FOR HE EVER HAD LIKED BRAVE MEN AND HE KNEW THAT THESE WOULD LAY DOWN THEIR LIVES TO SERVE HIM
AND SILENTLY MADE HIS CALCULATIONS THESE STONES HE SAID MUST HAVE COST YOUR LADYSHIP AN INCOME OF FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS YOU VALUE THEM AT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS NEARLY SO
AH SAID ANTHONY KEENLY WHAT'S HER NAME RICHARD BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE LIBRARY FLOOR THERE WAS ENOUGH COMRADESHIP AND SYMPATHY IN THIS CRUDE OLD FATHER OF HIS TO DRAW HIS CONFIDENCE WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER
SHE SAID THE JEWELER BOWED AND LEFT THE HOUSE DIRECTING THAT THE VAN SHOULD FOLLOW HIM CLOSELY SAYING ALOUD THAT THE MARQUISE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE HER PLATE MELTED DOWN IN ORDER TO HAVE OTHER PLATE MANUFACTURED OF A MORE MODERN STYLE
ROBIN DISLIKED TO DO THIS FOR HE WAS THE LEADER OF THE OTHERS AND DID NOT THINK IT GOOD FOR DISCIPLINE THAT HIS MEN SHOULD BEHOLD THEIR LEADER UNDERGO SUCH AN INDIGNITY HOWEVER HE ENDED THE MATTER BY ASKING THE MONK WHO WAS RICHARD
BUT THEY ARE ALL IN ORDER YOU SAY YES IN YOUR LADYSHIP'S OWN ROOM THE GOLD PLATE IN THE CHEST AND THE SILVER PLATE IN THE GREAT OAK CLOSET
THE BLOW HAD BEEN THE MORE PAINFUL ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BEING UNEXPECTED IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THE MARQUISE RECOVERED HERSELF BUT ONCE RECOVERED SHE BEGAN TO REFLECT UPON THE EVENTS SO HEARTLESSLY ANNOUNCED TO HER SHE THEREFORE RETURNED AT THE RISK EVEN OF LOSING HER LIFE IN THE WAY
LET MY GOLDSMITH BE SENT FOR HER ATTENDANTS QUITTED THE ROOM TO EXECUTE THE ORDER THE MARQUISE HOWEVER HAD ENTERED HER OWN ROOM AND WAS INSPECTING HER CASKET OF JEWELS WITH THE GREATEST ATTENTION
DONE CRIED ONE OF THE FORESTERS WHEREUPON ROBIN LAID AN ARROW TO HIS BOW AND SHOT SO CLEVERLY THAT THE DEER LAY DEAD IN ITS TRACKS THE FORESTERS WERE GREATLY ANGERED THAT HE HAD SUCCEEDED AND NOT ONLY REFUSED TO PAY HIM
TAKE HER FOR A WALK IN THE PARK OR A STRAW RIDE OR WALK HOME WITH HER FROM CHURCH CHANCE PSHAW YOU DON'T KNOW THE SOCIAL MILL DAD SHE'S PART OF THE STREAM THAT TURNS IT EVERY HOUR AND MINUTE OF HER TIME IS ARRANGED FOR DAYS IN ADVANCE
RETURN HOME AND BRING THE SUM IN QUESTION IN NOTES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE YES MADAME BUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
WITH SORROW RATHER THAN INDIGNATION
I WISH IT WOULD AS HEARTILY AS YOU WHO READ IT WISH IT DID
HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT SAID BROTHER ANTHONY YAWNING I TOLD HIM MY BANK ACCOUNT WAS AT HIS SERVICE
HE WAS PUNISHED WITH THE MOST INHUMAN CRUELTY NOW AS HAS BEEN SAID MANY MEN WERE TOO HIGH SPIRITED TO SUFFER THE INJUSTICE THAT JOHN LAID UPON THEM THEY FLED INTO THE FORESTS INSTEAD AND FORMED ARMED BANDS SETTING UPON TRAVELERS AND ROBBING THEM OF THEIR GOODS
TELLING THEM THAT THEY MUST SHOOT TO GOOD PURPOSE FOR HE THAT MISSED WERE IT ONLY BY A HAIR SHOULD BE KNOCKED DOWN BY WILL SCARLET ONE AFTER ONE OF THE OUTLAWS SHOT AND THEY ALL STRUCK THE MARK BUT WHEN ROBIN HIMSELF SHOT SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT HIS BAND HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN
GIVE ME AN ANSWER SIMPLY YOU ARE AN HONORABLE MAN WITH WHOM MY FAMILY HAS DEALT FOR THIRTY YEARS YOU KNEW MY FATHER AND MOTHER WHOM YOUR OWN FATHER AND MOTHER SERVED I ADDRESS YOU AS A FRIEND WILL YOU ACCEPT THE GOLD OF THE SETTINGS IN RETURN FOR A SUM OF READY MONEY TO BE PLACED IN MY HANDS
BUT THROUGH THE COMMON INJUSTICE OF THE DAY WHEN HE WAS A VERY YOUNG MAN HE WAS JOURNEYING TO THE TOWN OF NOTTINGHAM WHERE THE SHERIFF HAD PREPARED A BOUT IN ARCHERY AND HAD PROMISED A BUTT OF ALE TO WHATEVER MAN SHOULD DRAW THE BEST BOW AND SHOOT THE MOST SKILFUL ARROW
YOUR SET MADAME COMES NEXT WHAT ARE THEY WORTH MOUNTED NO SUPPOSING I WISHED TO SELL THEM
THIRTEEN HUNDRED THERE YOU ARE KELLY SAID ANTHONY TEARING OFF A CHECK
AND TO THE AMAZEMENT OF ROBIN AND LITTLE JOHN LAID HOLD OF A YOUNG OAK TREE AND TORE IT UP BY THE ROOTS WITH APPARENTLY BUT LITTLE EXERTION OF HIS STRENGTH THEN TRIMMING OFF THE BRANCHES HE STOOD ON GUARD ROBIN WAS WARNED BY THIS EXHIBITION OF POWER AND APPROACHED HIM WARILY
AND THE AVARICE OF MAZARIN AT A PERIOD OF LIFE WHEN HE HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF GORGING HIMSELF WITH FRENCH GOLD THE SPIRIT OF THIS COURAGEOUS WOMAN SOON RESUMED ITS ENERGY NO LONGER OVERWHELMED BY INDULGENCE IN COMPASSIONATE LAMENTATIONS
SAID ROBIN TO LITTLE JOHN I'LL SHOW HIM THAT THERE BE SOME HONEST FOLK ABROAD WHO ARE NOT AFRAID TO EARN THEIR LIVING FOR BY MY FAITH I'LL TAKE HIS PURSE AND USE THE GOLD THEREIN TO FAR BETTER ADVANTAGE THAN HE COULD DO SO WHEN THE YOUNG MAN APPROACHED ROBIN STEPPED OUT INTO THE PATH TO MEET HIM WITH HIS TRUSTY CUDGEL IN HIS HAND
AND ROBIN'S GORGE ROSE AT THE SIGHT OF HIM FOR HE HATED UNMANLINESS AND THOUGHT THAT THIS GAILY CLAD LADYLIKE FELLOW WHO SEEMED TO TURN HIS NOSE UP AT THE GROUND HE WALKED UPON MUST BE A COURTIER OR SOME NOBLEMAN THAT HAD NEVER DONE AN HONEST DAY'S WORK OR ROBBERY IN HIS LIFE WHEN HE COMES NEARER
ON THIS OCCASION HOWEVER SHE ADMIRED THE SIZE OF THE RUBIES AND THE BRILLIANCY OF THE DIAMONDS SHE GRIEVED OVER EVERY BLEMISH AND EVERY DEFECT SHE THOUGHT THE GOLD LIGHT AND THE STONES WRETCHED THE GOLDSMITH AS HE ENTERED FOUND HER THUS OCCUPIED
HE SAW A CONGESTED FLOOD OF WAGONS TRUCKS CABS VANS AND STREET CARS FILLING THE VAST SPACE WHERE BROADWAY SIXTH AVENUE AND THIRTY FOURTH STREET CROSS ONE ANOTHER AS A TWENTY SIX INCH MAIDEN FILLS HER TWENTY TWO INCH GIRDLE
THIS CARRIAGE OR RATHER HOUSE UPON WHEELS EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF THE WHOLE QUARTER IN WHICH HE RESIDED IT WAS COVERED WITH ALLEGORICAL PAINTINGS AND CLOUDS SCATTERED OVER WITH STARS
THE REMAINDER YOU WILL DISPOSE OF AMONG PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS
THE DISHES FOR THE PRESERVES AND THE TEA AND COFFEE URNS COST YOUR LADYSHIP SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS NO MORE YOUR LADYSHIP THOUGHT THE ACCOUNT VERY HIGH YES YES I REMEMBER IN FACT THAT IT WAS DEAR BUT IT WAS THE WORKMANSHIP I SUPPOSE
YOU WILL TAKE AWAY WITH YOU BOTH THE GOLD AND SILVER PLATE I CAN ASSIGN AS A PRETEXT THAT I WISH IT REMODELED ON PATTERS MORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH MY OWN TASTE MELT IT DOWN AND RETURN ME ITS VALUE IN MONEY AT ONCE IT SHALL BE DONE YOUR LADYSHIP
WITH AN ACHING HEAD BUT WITH ADMIRATION OF THE STRANGE YOUNG MAN IN HIS HEART ROBIN ASKED HIM TO JOIN HIS BAND PROMISING HIM FOOD BOOTY AND GOOD LINCOLN GREEN TO WEAR AND THE STRANGER AFTER LEARNING WHO ROBIN WAS
COMMENTED THE EX SOAP KING THE EDEN MUSEE'LL GET THAT OLD FROZEN NESSELRODE YET IF HE DON'T WATCH OUT I'LL HAVE THIS HOUSE PAINTED RED WHITE AND BLUE NEXT SUMMER AND SEE IF THAT'LL MAKE HIS DUTCH NOSE TURN UP ANY HIGHER AND THEN ANTHONY ROCKWALL WHO NEVER CARED FOR BELLS
IF YOU WILL ALLOW IT AND I WILL CALL FOR IT AT YOUR HOUSE CERTAINLY YOUR LADYSHIP
A CUSTOM OF THEIRS WHENEVER THEY ROBBED A WORTHY MONK OR PRIEST TO REMOVE SOME OF THE STING FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS LOSS I HAVE HEARD SAID THE SUPPOSED MONK AFTER HE HAD EATEN AND DRUNK HIS FILL
AND THEY LIVED BY SHOOTING THE KING'S DEER AND WHATEVER GAME THEY COULD CATCH AND KILL AMONG THESE MEN WAS AN OUTLAW CALLED ROBIN HOOD WHOSE FAME WAS KNOWN THROUGH THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF ENGLAND ALTHOUGH MANY MEN AT ARMS HAD PURSUED HIM THEY NEVER COULD CATCH HIM AND HIS DARING SURPASSED BELIEF
THE ARISTOCRATIC CLUBMAN G VAN SCHUYLIGHT SUFFOLK JONES CAME OUT TO HIS WAITING MOTOR CAR WRINKLING A CONTUMELIOUS NOSTRIL AS USUAL AT THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE SCULPTURE OF THE SOAP PALACE'S FRONT ELEVATION STUCK UP OLD STATUETTE OF NOTHING DOING
THE MARQUISE WAS NOT ONE TO WEEP WHEN ACTION WAS NECESSARY NOR TO WASTE TIME IN BEWAILING A MISFORTUNE AS LONG AS MEANS STILL EXISTED OF RELIEVING IT FOR SOME MINUTES SHE BURIED HER FACE IN HER COLD FINGERS AND THEN RAISING HER HEAD
THE KING'S FORESTERS COULD NOT BE SLAIN WITH IMPUNITY IN THOSE DAYS AND ROBIN WAS MADE AN OUTLAW NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD SLAIN HIS MAN BUT BECAUSE HE HAD KILLED THE KING'S DEER AND IN SUCH A WAY IT CAME TO PASS THAT HE GATHERED A BAND OF FOLLOWERS ABOUT HIM IN SHERWOOD FOREST
OH ANTHONY
THERE WILL BE A COMPETITION FOR THEM I CAN EASILY DISPOSE OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WORTH TO MONSIEUR I AM CERTAIN YOURS ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WHEN CAN YOU DO SO IN LESS THAN THREE DAYS TIME VERY WELL
THE OLD MAN LAID ASIDE HIS NEWSPAPER LOOKED AT HIM WITH A KINDLY GRIMNESS ON HIS BIG SMOOTH RUDDY COUNTENANCE RUMPLED HIS MOP OF WHITE HAIR WITH ONE HAND AND RATTLED THE KEYS IN HIS POCKET WITH THE OTHER RICHARD SAID ANTHONY ROCKWALL WHAT DO YOU PAY FOR THE SOAP THAT YOU USE
WHICH WITH IMPERIOUS AND EVEN MAJESTIC DIGNITY HELD ITSELF ERECT IN SPITE OF THE WEIGHT OF YEARS SO THAT THE HEAD REACHED THE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF HIS LINEAMENTS THOUGH WORN AND RAVAGED CONSERVED TRACES OF BEAUTY
WHICH ACCORDING TO HIM REVEALS ITSELF EVEN IN THE POLAR REGIONS AT THE HOUR OF SUNRISE AND WHEN THE TEAMS OF DAY TRANSFIGURING THE GIGANTIC ROCKS OF ICE MAKE THEM RESEMBLE THOSE CASTLES OF DIAMONDS WE READ OF IN FAIRY TALES
WHEN HE HAD MINUTELY DESCRIBED THE PLACE WHERE THIS MONUMENT STOOD A YOUNG SEAMAN SUDDENLY RECOGNISED THE SPOT THE VILLAGE WHERE I WAS BORN HE EXCLAIMED IS SITUATED PRECISELY THERE DURING MY CHILDHOOD I HAVE LONG WATCHED THERE THE PIGS OF MY FATHER
WERE HIS FAVORITE SOCIETY NEVERTHELESS HE ADDED THAT HE FELT MUCH PLEASURE AT THIS MOMENT IN SPEAKING HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE BEING GREEK BY BIRTH HE BEGGED HIS COMPATRIOTS TO INFORM HIM AS TO THE THEN STATE OF GREECE HE LEARNT WITH A MALICIOUS JOY BADLY DISSIMULATED
UPON THE ALTAR OF JUPITER LET SUCH REJOICE IN HIS FALL AND MOCK HIM AT THEIR EASE IN REVENGE FOR THE BLOOD OF THEIR ANCESTORS VICTIMS OF IDOLATRY AS FOR ME
AND DID NOT FEEL AT EASE UNTIL THEY COULD NO MORE HEAR THE SOBBINGS OF THE OLD MAN THE CROAKINGS OF THE HIDEOUS BIRD AND THE BLEATINGS OF THE GOAT WHEN THEY GOT ON BOARD THEIR VESSEL AGAIN THEY RELATED THEIR ADVENTURES AMONG THE CREW THERE CHANCED TO BE A SCHOLAR
HUNDREDS OF WATER RATS CAN COME AND SETTLE IN IT
AND HIDING HIS VISAGE IN HIS HANDS WEPT LIKE A CHILD THE BIRD AT HIS SIDE EMITTED TERRIBLE CRIES SPREAD ITS ENORMOUS WINGS AND MENACED THE STRANGERS WITH TALONS AND BEAK
THEY WERE NOBLE AND PERFECTLY REGULAR THIN LOCKS OF SILVER HAIR FELL UPON THE FOREHEAD WRINKLED BY PRIDE AND BY AGE HIS EYES THOUGH GLAZED AND LUSTRELESS
HAS BENEATH ITS SKIN STRATA OF FAT OF A DEPTH SO PRODIGIOUS THAT A SINGLE WHALE OFTEN FURNISHES A HUNDRED TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BARRELS OF TALLOW AND OIL THESE LAYERS OF FAT ARE SO THICK THAT WHILE THE COLOSSUS SLEEPS
ALREADY HIS REVELATIONS CONCERNING THE SECRET SUFFERINGS OF THE WHALE HAD PROFOUNDLY SADDENED ME POOR ANIMAL AGAINST THIS VILE MOB OF RATS WHICH HOUSE THEMSELVES IN YOUR BODY AND GNAW YOU INCESSANTLY
SUCH A SPECTACLE WILL NO DOUBT GIVE PLEASURE TO THE VILE MULTITUDE WHICH INSULTS TO DAY THAT WHICH IT ADORED YESTERDAY PERHAPS AMONG THESE WORTHY PEOPLE ARE TO BE FOUND SOME OF THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE UNLUCKY BULLS WHICH WERE OF OLD IMMOLATED IN HECATOMBS
WAS EVIDENTLY THE FAMOUS EAGLE WHICH USED TO BEAR THE THUNDERBOLTS IN ITS TALONS AND THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY THE GOAT WAS THE OLD NURSE AMALTHEA WHICH HAD OF OLD SUCKLED THE GOD IN THE ISLE OF CRETE
GREAT SLABS OF MARBLE SQUARED FRAGMENTS OF WALL AND TRIANGULAR PIECES OF ROOFING ARE SCATTERED ABOUT HALF BURIED IN THE EARTH I HAVE OFTEN CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN PASSED HOURS AT A TIME IN EXAMINING THE COMBATS AND THE GAMES
SEIZED WITH NAUSEA IT VOMITED HIM AFTER THREE DAYS MOST CERTAINLY THAT PROVES THE ABSENCE OF ALL RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT IN THESE MONSTERS THE WHALE THEREFORE WOULD NEVER CHOOSE AN ICE BLOCK FOR PRAYER CUSHION
AND ADDRESSES TO HIM ITS PRAYERS THE DOMINIE ASSURES US THAT HE HAS SEEN WITH HIS OWN EYES A WHALE WHICH HELD ITSELF ERECT AGAINST THE WALL OF A BLOCK OF ICE AND SWAYED THE UPPER PART OF ITS BODY AS MEN DO IN PRAYER NIELS ANDERSEN ADMITTED
AND IF I HAVE NOT BECOME A FAMOUS WHALER THE FAULT RESTS NEITHER WITH NIELS ANDERSEN NOR WITH MYSELF BUT WITH MY EVIL STAR WHICH HAS NEVER ALLOWED ME IN THE COURSE OF MY LIFE TO ENCOUNTER ANY WHALE WITH WHICH I MIGHT HAVE ENGAGED IN HONORABLE COMBAT
MOREOVER THIS BEAST IS SYMPATHETIC HE HAS A GOOD CHARACTER AND MUCH TASTE FOR CONJUGAL LIFE IT IS A TOUCHING SIGHT HE ADDED TO SEE A FAMILY OF WHALES GROUPED AROUND ITS VENERABLE PATRIARCH AND COUCHED UPON AN ENORMOUS MASS OF ICE BASKING IN THE SUN
ON THE LEFT OF THE OLD MAN WAS COUCHED UPON THE GROUND AN AGED BALD SKINNED SHE GOT YET WITH A GENTLE LOOK AND WHICH IN SPITE OF ITS GREAT AGE HAD THE DUGS SWOLLEN WITH MILK AND THE TEATS FRESH AND ROSY
NO REMEDY AVAILS AND YOU CARRY THEM ABOUT WITH YOU TO THE END OF YOUR DAYS RUSH AS YOU WILL TO THE NORTH AND TO THE SOUTH
HERE AND THERE WERE SCATTERED SOME DWARF SHRUBS AND STUNTED FIRS CROUCHING ON THE STERILE SOIL RABBITS RAN ABOUT EVERYWHERE IN GREAT NUMBERS AND THIS IS THE REASON THE SAILORS CALL THE ISLET THE ISLE OF RABBITS
WAS THE HERETOFORE KING OF THE GODS JUPITER THE CHRONIDE YES HE
OF WHICH THE RAMPARTS OF ICE OFFERED HIM A SURE REFUGE AGAINST HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMIES WHO HAD USURPED HIS LEGITIMATE RIGHTS
NIELS ANDERSEN BORN AT DRONTHEIM IN NORWAY WAS ONE OF THE MOST SKILFUL AND INTREPID WHALERS I HAVE EVER KNOWN IT IS TO HIM THAT I AM INDEBTED FOR WHAT KNOWLEDGE I HAVE OF THE WHALE FISHERY
ON THE BELLY OF WHICH HE DRUMMED AWAY WITH HIS WOODEN LEG I OFTEN HELPED HIM TO CLIMB UPON THIS BARREL BUT SOMETIMES WHEN HE WISHED TO GET DOWN AGAIN I WOULD NOT GIVE HIM MY HELP EXCEPT ON THE CONDITION THAT HE TOLD ME ONE OF HIS CURIOUS TRADITIONS OF THE ARCTIC SEA
IS THE HISTORY TOLD ME LONG AGO BY MY FRIEND NIELS ANDERSEN I HAVE JUST MENTIONED NIELS ANDERSEN AND THIS GOOD FIGURE AT ONCE SO DROLL AND SO LOVABLE
THIS QUEER OLD FELLOW MUST BE EITHER A GHOST OR AN EVIL SPIRIT AT THESE WORDS THE OLD MAN TREMBLED AND ROSE SUDDENLY FROM HIS SEAT AND THE SAILORS TO THEIR GREAT ASTONISHMENT SAW A LOFTY AND IMPOSING FIGURE
ON THIS SITE THERE ARE IN FACT THE RUINS OF VERY ANCIENT CONSTRUCTIONS WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY MAGNIFICENT HERE AND THERE YOU SEE SOME COLUMNS STILL ERECT THEY ARE ISOLATED OR CONNECTED BY FRAGMENTS OF ROOFING
BUT WHO WAS MOREOVER GUILTY OF INCEST AND OTHER INFAMOUS VICES THAT IN THEIR BLINDNESS THE IDOLATORS HAD NEVERTHELESS IMMOLATED OXEN
WHAT IS THIS ISLE OF RABBITS I ASKED NIELS ANDERSEN DRUMMING ON THE BARREL WITH HIS WOODEN LEG HE ANSWERED IT IS EXACTLY IN THIS ISLE THAT THE EVENTS TOOK PLACE OF WHICH I AM GOING TO TELL YOU
SO NIELS ANDERSEN PREFACED ALL HIS NARRATIVES WITH A PANEGYRICAL ENUMERATION OF THE QUALITIES OF THE WHALE HE OF COURSE COMMENCED WITH SUCH A PANEGYRIC THE LEGEND WE GIVE HERE THE WHALE HE SAID
WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED TO QUIT THEIR HOLES THESE BANQUETS OF VERMIN AT LENGTH TROUBLE THEIR INVOLUNTARY HOST AND EVEN CAUSE HIM EXCESSIVE SUFFERINGS NOT HAVING HANDS AS WE HAVE WHO GOD BE THANKED CAN SCRATCH OURSELVES WHEN WE FEEL AN ITCHING
AND WHICH NOW CONTINUED TO NOURISH HIM WITH ITS MILK IN THE ISLE OF RABBITS SUCH WAS THE HISTORY OF NIELS ANDERSEN AND IT MADE MY HEART BLEED I WILL NOT DISSEMBLE
BUT THE OLD MAN COULD GIVE THEM BUT SCANT INFORMATION
AS WE SEE THE DOGS RASPING THEIR SKIN AGAINST A BED POST WHEN THE FLEAS BITE THEM OVERMUCH NOW IN THESE MOVEMENTS THE GOOD DOMINIE THOUGHT HE SAW THE EDIFYING ACT OF PRAYER AND HE ATTRIBUTED TO DEVOTION THE JERKINGS OCCASIONED BY THE ORGIES OF THE RATS
THESE WORDS RESONANT AND HARMONIOUS
WHAT CAN BE THE REASON IS IT THAT THEY CANNOT FIND A CHURCH SUFFICIENTLY SPACIOUS TO AFFORD THEM ENTRANCE INTO ITS PALE NOR HAVE THE WHALES ANY TASTE FOR THE PROPHETS AND THE ONE WHICH SWALLOWED JONAH WAS NOT ABLE TO DIGEST THAT GREAT PREACHER
OF OLD INHABITED BY A PAGAN GOD
BE ADORED BY A HUNDRED NATIONS DURING LONG CENTURIES BE THE LOVER OF SEMELE OF DANAE OF EUROPA OF ALCMENA
FOR HE DESCRIBED CLEARLY AND EXACTLY THE GULFS THE PENINSULAS THE CAPES OFTEN EVEN THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT HILLS AND ISOLATED GROUPS OF ROCKS HIS IGNORANCE OF THE COMMONEST TYPOGRAPHICAL NAMES THEREFORE ASTONISHED THEM ALL THE MORE
THAT EVERY YEAR AT THE SEASON WHEN THE FLOATING ICE BLOCKS FORMED A COMPACT MASS TROOPS OF SAVAGES IN SLEDGES VISITED HIM WHO IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS RABBIT SKINS GAVE HIM ALL SORTS OF ARTICLES MOST NECESSARY TO LIFE
ALL THIS BEAUTY OF THE CREATION IN THE JUDGMENT OF THE GOOD DOMINIE IS A PROOF OF THE POWER OF GOD WHICH INFLUENCES EVERY LIVING CREATURE SO THAT NOT ONLY MAN BUT LIKEWISE A GREAT BRUTE OF A FISH RAVISHED BY THIS SPECTACLE ADORES THE CREATOR
HE SHOWED LESS SATISFACTION WHEN THEY TOLD HIM THAT THIS CHRISTIAN SYMBOL HAD BEEN REPLACED BY THE CRESCENT THE MOST SINGULAR THING WAS THAT NONE OF THE SEAMEN KNEW THE NAMES OF THE TOWNS CONCERNING WHICH HE QUESTIONED THEM AND WHICH ACCORDING TO HIM HAD BEEN FLOURISHING CITIES IN HIS TIME
BEFORE THE RECENT CHANGES HAD WROUGHT HAVOC PREPARATORY TO FURTHER PROGRESS SHE SEEMED ALWAYS TO ME THE MODEL OF A MOTHER OF THE OLD SCHOOL HERSELF A WOMAN OF THOROUGH CLASSICAL EDUCATION
MANY SUCH OLD LADIES I HAVE MET
TROTTING ABOUT WITH A YOKE OVER HER SHOULDERS FROM WHICH ARE SUSPENDED TWO SWINGING BASKETS FILLED WITH FRESH VEGETABLES
THAT WAS YEARS AGO AND THE OLD AUNTY'S HARD TIMES ARE NEARLY OVER HALE AND HEARTY AT THREE SCORE YEARS AND TEN SHE HAS SEEN THESE CHILDREN GROW UP ONE BY ONE UNTIL NOW SOME HAVE GONE TO NEW HOMES OF THEIR OWN HER BENT FORM AND WRINKLED FACE
RATHER THAN EASE AND LUXURY AND THAT CARE FOR THE FUTURE IS NOT THE NECESSITY THAT IT IS IN EUROPE AND AMERICA WHERE MONEY
STEPPED FORWARD AND PERFORMED THE SAME CEREMONY BEFORE LEAVING THE ROOM WHAT THE MEANING OF THE RITE WAS I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER A WORSHIP OF STRANGE GODS OR NO BUT TO ME AS I PERFORMED THE ACT
RATHER THAN BE A BURDEN TO THEM SHE MADE HER HOME FOR MANY YEARS WITH HER OWN YOUNGER BROTHER TAKING UP AGAIN THE MANY CARES AND DUTIES OF A MOTHER'S LIFE IN SHARING WITH THE MOTHER THE BRINGING UP OF A LARGE FAMILY OF CHILDREN ONE BY ONE FROM THE OLDEST TO THE YOUNGEST
BUT SOME MORNING YOU AWAKE TO FIND YOUR LAWN COVERED WITH OLD WOMEN
A JAPANESE CONSIDERS HIS PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE MADE WHEN HE HAS BROUGHT UP AND EDUCATED FOR USEFULNESS A LARGE FAMILY OF CHILDREN HE INVESTS HIS CAPITAL IN THEIR SUPPORT AND EDUCATION SECURE OF BOUNTIFUL RETURNS IN THEIR GRATITUDE AND CARE FOR HIS OLD AGE
TELL STORIES TO HER GRANDCHILDREN AFTER THEIR LESSONS ARE LEARNED GIVE THE BENEFIT OF HER YEARS OF EXPERIENCE TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL BEARING THE HEAT AND BURDEN OF THE DAY
TRIED BY WAR BY SIEGE BY BANISHMENT BY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS OF ALL KINDS
AND INDEPENDENT HOME OF HIS OWN AND TO SUPPORT HER AND HER CHILDREN BY HIS OWN LABOR OR ON HIS OWN INCOME BUT HE TAKES HER TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND THINKS IT NO SHAME THAT HIS FAMILY LIVE UPON HIS PARENTS BUT IN RETURN WHEN THE PARENTS WISH TO RETIRE FROM ACTIVE LIFE
BUT THE OBEDIENCE AND RESPECT OF CHILDREN BOTH MALE AND FEMALE TO THEIR PARENTS ALSO OCCUPIES A PROMINENT POSITION IN THEIR ETHICAL SYSTEM HENCE IN THIS LATTER STAGE OF A WOMAN'S CAREER THE OBEDIENCE EXPECTED OF HER IS OFTEN ONLY NOMINAL
TO THE THEATRE OR OTHER SHOWS WITHOUT THE LEAST RESTRAINT OR FEAR OF LOSING HER DIGNITY A JAPANESE WOMAN LOSES HER BEAUTY EARLY AT THIRTY FIVE HER FRESH COLOR IS USUALLY ENTIRELY GONE HER EYES HAVE BEGUN TO SINK A LITTLE IN THEIR SOCKETS
THE CARES OF THE WORLD TO HAVE A FEW YEARS OF CALM AND PEACE UNDISTURBED BY RESPONSIBILITIES OR CARES FOR OUTSIDE MATTERS
AND INCOME TO THE CARE OF HIS ELDEST SON UPON WHOM HE BECOMES ENTIRELY DEPENDENT FOR HIS SUPPORT
ONE SELDOM SEES AMONG THEM WHAT WE WOULD CALL BEAUTY FOR THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL SHRINKING WITH AGE THAT TAKES PLACE AMONG THE JAPANESE COVERS THE FACE WITH MULTITUDINOUS WRINKLES
AND IF TIMES ARE HARD AND FOOD AND OTHER COMFORTS ARE SCARCE THE CHILDREN AS A MATTER OF COURSE DEPRIVE THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN TO GIVE UNGRUDGINGLY TO THEIR OLD FATHER AND MOTHER FAULTS THERE ARE MANY IN THE JAPANESE SOCIAL SYSTEM
PITTANCE BY THEIR WEIRD MUSIC THEY SEEM THE EMBODIMENT OF ALL THAT IS HOPELESS AND BROKEN HEARTED
AND BY HER PRAYERS AND VISITS TO THE TEMPLE AT STATED SEASONS WILL SECURE THE FAVOR OF THE GODS FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY AS WELL AS MAKE HER OWN PREPARATIONS FOR ENTRY INTO THE GREAT UNKNOWN TOWARD WHICH SHE IS RAPIDLY DRIFTING
AND LOOKS WITH SCORN ON FOREIGN CUSTOMS WHICH SEEM TO BETOKEN A FEAR LEST IN OLD AGE UNGRATEFUL CHILDREN MAY NEGLECT THEIR PARENTS AND CAST THEM ASIDE THE FEELING SO STRONG IN AMERICA THAT DEPENDENCE IS OF ITSELF IRKSOME AND A THING TO BE DREADED
THIS HABIT OF THOUGHT MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE UTTER WANT OF PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE AND THE DISREGARD FOR THINGS PERTAINING TO THE ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH WHICH OFTEN STRIKES CURIOUSLY THE FOREIGNER IN JAPAN
WHILE VERY YOUNG AND THE MANNER OF ARRANGING IT IS ONE OF THE DISTINCTIVE MARKS OF THE AGE OF THE CHILD
IS THE TIME FOR MUCH CHEERFUL TALK AND GOSSIP BUT THE WORK THOUGH DONE SLOWLY AND WITH DUE ATTENTION TO THE COMFORT OF THE WORKER IS WELL DONE AND CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHED AS RAPIDLY AS ANY ONE COULD EXPECT OF LABORERS WHO EARN ONLY FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE CENTS A DAY
THE CEMETERY CHAPEL WAS CROWDED BUT A PLACE WAS RESERVED FOR ME ON ACCOUNT OF SPECIAL TIES THAT BOUND ME TO THE FAMILY JUST BEHIND THE LONG LINE OF WHITE ROBED MOURNERS
AND IN ANY CASE IS NOT SO ABSOLUTE AND UNQUESTIONING AS THAT OF THE EARLY PERIOD AND THE CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT THAT A SON IS BOUND TO SHOW TO HIS MOTHER NECESSITATES A CARE OF HER COMFORT
THE DRIVES AND WALKS ENJOYED IN HER COMPANY THE TOYS AND CANDIES THAT CAME OUT UNEXPECTEDLY FROM THE DEPTHS OF MYSTERIOUS DRAWERS TO COMFORT MANY AN HOUR OF CHILDISH GRIEF
WHO DANCED AND SANG THROUGH THE BRIEF SUMMER TO COME WAILING AND WRETCHED SEEKING AID FROM HER THRIFTIER NEIGHBOR WHEN AT LAST THE WINTER CLOSED IN UPON HER
IS ALTOGETHER STRANGE TO THE JAPANESE MIND
FOR IT IS GIVEN FREELY TO THE TIME HONORED EUROPEAN BELIEF THAT A YOUNG MAN MUST BE INDEPENDENT AND ENTERPRISING IN EARLY LIFE IN ORDER TO LAY BY FOR OLD AGE THE JAPANESE WILL ANSWER THAT CHILDREN IN JAPAN ARE TAUGHT TO LOVE THEIR PARENTS
AND BY THE BUDDHIST CEREMONIAL SHE WAS BURIED THE CHANTED RITUAL
UNTIL AT SIXTY OR SEVENTY IT IS NOT MORE THAN A FEW INCHES IN WIDTH THE NUMBER SIZE AND VARIETY OF ORNAMENTAL HAIRPINS AND THE TORTOISE SHELL COMB WORN IN FRONT ALL VARY WITH THE AGE
BUT BOTH ALIKE FIND A PEACEFUL SHELTER IN THE HOMES OF THOSE NEAREST AND DEAREST TO THEM ONE OF THE HAPPIEST OLD LADIES I HAVE EVER SEEN WAS ONE WHO HAD HAD A ROUGH AND STORMY LIFE
ARE EVER WELCOME TO HER CHILDREN HERS BY THE RIGHT OF YEARS OF PATIENT CARE AND TOIL FOR THEM THEY NOW IN THEIR TURN ENJOY GIVING HER PLEASURE AND RETURN TO HER ALL THE LOVE SHE HAS LAVISHED UPON THEM IT IS A JOY TO SEE HER CHILDLIKE PRIDE AND CONFIDENCE IN THEM ALL
TO JOIN IN A QUIET SMOKE OVER THE HIBACHI OR TO PLAY THE DEEP ENGROSSING GAME OF GO OR SHOGI
EVERY ONE OF THEM HEIRS OF HER SPIRIT AND OF HER INTELLECT THOUGH CONSERVATIVE HERSELF AND ALWAYS CLINGING TO THE OLD CUSTOMS
AND DISAPPOINTMENT PATIENTLY AND SWEETLY BORNE THE LIPS NEVER FORGET TO SMILE THE VOICE REMAINS ALWAYS CHEERFUL AND SYMPATHETIC NEVER GROWS PEEVISH AND WORRIED
TWO WEEKS LATER AMID SUCH RAIN AS JAPANESE SKIES KNOW ALL TOO WELL HOW TO LET FALL I ATTENDED HER FUNERAL AT THE CEMETERY OF AOYAMA
BUT YOUTH WITH ITS HOPEFUL OUTLOOK ITS PLANS AND ITS AMBITIONS GIVES WAY TO AGE WITH ITS PEACEFUL WAITING FOR THE END WITH ONLY A BRIEF STRUGGLE FOR ITS PLACE AND THE WOMAN OF THIRTY FIVE IS JUST AT THE POINT WHEN SHE HAS BID GOOD BY TO HER YOUTH
IT IS NOT ONLY FOR THE WOMEN OF JAPAN BUT FOR THE MEN AS WELL THAT OLD AGE IS A TIME OF PEACE AND HAPPINESS WHEN A MAN REACHES THE AGE OF FIFTY OR THEREABOUTS OFTEN WHILE APPARENTLY IN THE HEIGHT OF HIS VIGOR HE GIVES UP HIS WORK OR BUSINESS AND RETIRES LEAVING ALL THE PROPERTY
THIS SUPPORT IS NEVER BEGRUDGED HIM FOR THE CARE OF PARENTS BY THEIR CHILDREN IS AS MUCH A MATTER OF COURSE IN JAPAN AS THE CARE OF CHILDREN BY THOSE WHO GIVE THEM BIRTH A MAN THUS RARELY MAKES PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE
AS THE TIME WHEN SHE WILL ATTAIN FREEDOM FROM HER LIFE LONG SERVICE TO THOSE ABOUT HER WILL BE IN THE POSITION OF ADVISER OF HER SONS AND DIRECTOR OF HER DAUGHTERS IN LAW WILL BE A PERSON OF MUCH CONSIDERATION IN THE FAMILY
THAN WHEN THEY HAD CROSSED BEFORE HE CURSED THE CONVENTIONS WHICH FORBADE HIS STAYING AND WATCHING OVER THE GIRL BACK THERE IN THE HOUSE WHICH ALREADY STOOD UPON AN ISLAND CUT OFF FROM THE SAFE
ASHAMED OF WHAT IT HAD DONE THURSTON IN THAT INSTANT CAME NEAR JERKING SUNFISH AROUND TO FOLLOW BUT HE CHECKED THE IMPULSE AS IT WAS FORMED AND LEFT THE REINS ALONE WHICH WAS WISE
WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR HER EYES GREETED HIM WITH A CERTAIN WISTFUL EXPRESSION THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN IN THEM BEFORE HE WAS GUILTY OF WISHING THAT PARK HAD STAYED IN CAMP
THE HAND OF PARK RESTED UPON HIS SHOULDER LOOKS KINDA DUBIOUS DON'T IT KID WAS YUH THINKING ABOUT RIDING DOWN THERE YES THURSTON ANSWERED SIMPLY
THURSTON FELT HIS LABORING AND CLUTCHED MONA STILL TIGHTER OF A SUDDEN THE HORSE'S HEAD WENT UNDER THE BLACK WATER CAME UP AROUND THURSTON'S THROAT WITH A HUNGRY SWISH AND SUNFISH WENT OUT FROM UNDER HIM LIKE AN EEL
NO ONE BUT HIMSELF EVER KNEW HIS EARS HUMMED FROM THE WATER IN THEM AND THE ROAR OF THE RIVER WAS TO HIM AS THE ROAR OF THE SEA HIS EYES SMARTED FROM THE CLAMMY TOUCH OF THE DINGY FROTH THAT WENT HURRYING BY IN MONSTER FLAKES
THE RANGE LAND WILL NEVER GET RID OF ME NOW HE CRIED JUBILANTLY HANK WANTED TO TAKE ME INTO THE LAZY EIGHT SO NOW I'LL BUY AN INTEREST AND STAY ALWAYS YOU DEAR MONA SNUGGLED CLOSE AND LEARNED HOW IT FEELS TO BE KISSED
THEN WHERE'D YUH BE AT IT WON'T GET UP HERE THOUGH MONA ASSERTED COOLLY IT NEVER HAS NO AND THE LAZY EIGHT NEVER HAD TO WORK THE YELLOWSTONE RANGE ON SPRING ROUNDUP BEFORE EITHER PARK TOLD HER MEANINGLY
BUT OUT WHERE THE CURRENT RAN SWIMMING DEEP HE FLOUNDERED DESPERATELY UNDER HIS DOUBLE BURDEN WHILE HIS STRENGTH LASTED HE KEPT HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER STRUGGLING GAMELY AGAINST THE FLOOD THAT LAPPED OVER HIS BACK AND BUBBLED IN HIS NOSTRILS
EVEN IF SHE WERE AT HOME WHAT GOOD COULD THAT POSSIBLY DO HIM JUST GIVE HIM SEVERAL BAD NIGHTS WHEN HE WOULD LIE IN HIS CORNER OF THE TENT AND LISTEN TO THE BOYS SNORING WITH A DIFFERENT KEY FOR EVERY MAN
HE HAD A POOR OPINION OF JACK AND RESENTED EVEN THAT SLIGHT RELATION TO MONA THE ROAD WAS SOGGY WITH THE RAIN WHICH FELL STEADILY DOWN IN THE BOTTOM THE LOW PLACES IN THE ROAD WERE ALREADY UNDER WATER
THURSTON TURNED JOYFULLY TOWARD HIM PARK OLD FELLOW I WAS AFRAID YUH BETTER REFORM AND QUIT BEING AFRAID PARK BANTERED I GOT OUT UH THE MIX UP FINE BUT I GUESS MY HORSE WENT ON DOWN POOR DEVIL
HE WROTE TO REEVE HOWARD THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY WERE TO START AND APOLOGIZED GRACEFULLY FOR HAVING NEGLECTED HIM DURING THE PAST THREE WEEKS AND TOLD HIM HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE HOME IN ANOTHER MONTH HE SAID THAT HE WAS
IN THE FIRST TEN DIFFERENT CAMPS APPEARED HE MOURNED BECAUSE TWO OTHERS WERE PERFORCED OMITTED
SEEING IT AND SMELLING IT AND FEELING THE RIOT OF SPRING IN HIS BLOOD STRAIGHTENED THE HUNCH OUT OF HIS SHOULDERS AND ADMITTED THAT IT WAS ALL TRUE THAT THE WORLD WAS GOOD AT MILES CITY
SHE'S UPSTAIRS HE SAID AND HIS VOICE SOUNDED STRAINED AND UNNATURAL IT'S JUST A LOFT WHERE THEY STORE STUFF HE STARTED TO RIDE INTO THE FLOOD
THE RIVER'S COMING UP PRETTY FAST MONA HE VENTURED DON'T YUH THINK YUH OUGHT TO PULL OUT AND GO VISITING NO I DON'T MONA'S TONE WAS VERY DECIDED
AND FROM SOMEWHERE DOWN THE RIVER CAME A FAINT REASSURING WHOOP THANK THE LORD GASPED THURSTON AND LEANED AGAINST HER FOR A SECOND THEN HE STRAIGHTENED ARE YOU ALL RIGHT HE ASKED
DOWN THE HILL THEY STOPPED AT THE EDGE OF A RAGING TORRENT AND STRAINED THEIR EYES TO SEE WHAT LAY ON THE OTHER SIDE WHILE THEY LOOKED A LIGHT TWINKLED OUT FROM AMONG THE TREE TOPS THURSTON CAUGHT HIS BREATH SHARPLY
HELD MONA SOMEWHAT TIGHTER THAN HE NEED TO HAVE DONE AND LET THE HORSE GO SO LONG AS SUNFISH HAD FOOTING HE BRACED HIMSELF AGAINST THE MAD RUSH OF WATERS AND FORGED AHEAD
AND TO ASK HER FOR THE FOURTH TIME IF SHE WILL RECONSIDER HER FORMER DECISIONS AND MARRY HIM THAT IS REALLY WHAT KEPT THURSTON AT THE LAZY EIGHT
JINGLING CAVVIES HERDS OF SADDLE HORSES THEY WERE DRIVEN AND WATCHED OVER BY THE HORSE WRANGLER CAME OUT OF THE WILDERNESS IN THE WAKE OF THE WAGONS THURSTON GOT OUT HIS CAMERA AND TOOK PICTURES OF THE SCENE
THEN THE SKY THREATENED FOR A DAY AND AFTER THAT THEY PLODDED IN THE RAIN THANK THE LORD THAT'S DONE WITH SIGHED PARK WHEN HE SAW THE LAST OF THE HERD CLIMB ALL DRIPPING UP THE NORTH BANK OF THE MILK RIVER
I WOULDN'T DROP DOWN ON A NEIGHBOR WITHOUT WARNING JUST BECAUSE THE RIVER HAPPENS TO BE COMING UP IT HAS COME UP EVERY JUNE SINCE WE'VE BEEN LIVING HERE AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL OF THEM AT THE WORST IT NEVER CAME INSIDE THE GATE
WHEREUPON MONA GOT UPON HER PEDESTAL AND SMILED HER UNPLEASANT SMILE AGAINST WHICH EVEN PARK HAD NO ARGUMENT READY THEY LINGERED TILL LONG AFTER ALL GOOD COWPUNCHERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THEIR BEDS
FOR THE CROWDING EMOTIONS IN HIS HEART AND BRAIN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAS NO WORDS MONA LIFTED HER FACE AND LOOKED INTO HIS EYES HER OWN WERE SOFT AND SHINING IN THE MOONLIGHT AND SHE WAS SMILING A LITTLE
SAME HERE SAID THURSTON WITH MUCH EMPHASIS THEN WITH MONA ONCE MORE IN THE SADDLE AND WITH THURSTON LEADING SUNFISH BY THE BRIDLE REIN
HIGH LAND BY A STRIP OF BACKWATER THAT WAS WIDENING AND DEEPENING EVERY MINUTE AND WHEN IT ROSE HIGH ENOUGH TO FLOW INTO THE RIVER BELOW WOULD HAVE A CURRENT THAT WOULD MAKE A NASTY CROSSING
THERE WAS A CONFUSED ROARING IN HIS EARS A HORRID SENSE OF SUFFOCATION FOR A MOMENT BUT HE HAD LEARNED TO SWIM WHEN HE WAS A BOY AT SCHOOL AND HE FREED ONE HAND FROM ITS GRIP ON MONA AND SET TO PADDLING WITH MUCH VIGOR AND CONSIDERABLY LESS SKILL
MONA THE SELF ASSURED MONA THE STRONG HEARTED WAS CRYING AND INSTINCTIVELY HE KNEW THAT NOT THE CHILL ALONE MADE HER SHIVER HE WAS KEEPING HIS ARM AROUND HER WAIST DELIBERATELY AND IT PLEASED HIM THAT SHE LET IT STAY
YOU DIDN'T COPE WITH THE SITUATION AFTER ALL HE REMARKED WHILE SHE WAS SETTLING HERSELF FIRMLY IN THE SADDLE I WENT TO SLEEP AND DIDN'T NOTICE THE WATER TILL IT WAS COMING IN AT THE DOOR SHE EXPLAINED
WHOSE WAGON BOSS KNOWING BEST THE RANGE WAS CAPTAIN OF THE FIVE CREWS AND DROVE NORTH GATHERING AND HOLDING ALL STOCK WHICH PROPERLY RANGED BEYOND THE MISSOURI
BY AND BY THE RAIN CEASED AND HE COULD TELL BY THE DIM WHITENESS OF THE TENT ROOF THAT THE CLOUDS MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY FROM BEFORE THE MOON THEN JUST PAST THE FULL HE GOT UP CAREFULLY SO AS NOT TO DISTURB THE OTHERS AND
PROBABLY SHE DID NOT MEAN IT AT ANY RATE THE BLOOD FLEW CONSCIOUSLY TO HER CHEEKS AFTER SHE HAD SPOKEN AND SHE CAUGHT HER UNDER LIP SHARPLY BETWEEN HER TEETH AND THAT DID NOT HELP MATTERS OR MAKE HER TEMPER MORE YIELDING
AND THE LONG SUMMER'S WORK BEGAN EACH RIDER A UNIT IN THE WAR AGAINST THE CHAOS WHICH THE WINTER HAD WROUGHT IN THE FIGHT OF THE STOCKMEN TO WREST BACK THEIR FORTUNES FROM THE WILDERNESS AND TO HOLD ONCE MORE THEIR SWAY OVER THE RANGE LAND
HE CAME NEAR GOING TO THE OTHER EXTREME AND REFUSING TO WRITE AT ALL THE WAGONS WERE OUT TWO WEEKS WHICH IS QUITE LONG ENOUGH FOR A CRISIS TO ARISE IN THE LOVE AFFAIR OF ANY MAN
CHAPTER THIRTEEN I'LL STAY ALWAYS FOR A LONG TIME THURSTON LAY WITH WIDE OPEN EYES STARING UP AT NOTHING LISTENING TO THE RAIN AND THINKING
AND THE LAUGHTER SPRING UNHERALDED INTO HER DEAR BIG EYES AND THE LIGHT TANGLE ITSELF IN THE WAVES OF HER HAIR HE GUIDED HIS HORSE CAREFULLY THROUGH THE DEEP PLACES AND NOTED UNEASILY HOW MUCH DEEPER IT WAS
TWO OF THE LAZY EIGHT WAGONS UNDER PARK AND GENE WASSON FOR HANK THAT SPRING WAS RUNNING FOUR CREWS AND HAD PROMOTED GENE WAGON BOSS OF ONE JOINED FORCES WITH THE CIRCLE BAR THE FLYING U AND A YELLOWSTONE OUTFIT
HIGH WATER IT WAS NEARING THE MIDDLE OF JUNE AND IT WAS GETTING TO BE A VERY HOT JUNE AT THAT
AND SAT THERE SWAYING DRUNKENLY UPON IT A GREAT YELLOW CAT CLUNG AND YOWLED HIS FEAR THAT'S OLD DUTCH HENRY'S HOUSE PARK SHOUTED ABOVE THE ROAR
THERE MUST BE DANGER OF IT THIS YEAR IF EVER THURSTON OBSERVED UNEASILY THE RIVER IS COMING UP PRETTY FAST IT SEEMS TO ME IT MUST HAVE RAISED THREE FEET SINCE WE CROSSED THIS AFTERNOON
SAY THE WATER HAS COME UP A LOT DON'T YUH THINK BUD IF IT RAISES MUCH MORE MONA'LL SURE HAVE A CHANCE TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION IT'D JUST ABOUT SERVE HER RIGHT TOO
THE WORLD WAS GOOD SOBER GRAY CURLEWS CIRCLED OVER HIS HEAD THEIR LONG FUNNY BILLS THRUST OUT STRAIGHT AS IF TO POINT THE WAY FOR THEIR BODIES TO FOLLOW AND CRIED
HE INTENDED TO HIT THE TRAIL FOR LITTLE OLD NEW YORK
THURSTON GLOATED OVER IT IN SILENCE UNTIL HE REMEMBERED PARK AFTER THAT HE COULD THINK OF LITTLE ELSE AS BEFORE NOW SUNFISH BATTLED AS SEEMED TO HIM BEST FOR THURSTON ASTRIDE BEHIND THE SADDLE
THEIR CARCASSES MADE UNSIGHTLY BLOTS IN THE COULEE BOTTOMS AND ON THE WIND SWEPT LEVELS OF THE CALVES THAT HAD FOLLOWED THEIR MOTHERS ON THE LONG TRAIL HUNDREDS HAD DROPPED OUT OF THE MARCH AND BEEN LEFT BEHIND FOR THE WOLVES BUT NOT ALL
FROM THE UPPER MUSSELSHELL THEY CAME AND FROM OUT THE JUDITH BASIN FROM SHELLANNE EAST TO FORT BUFORD TRULY IT WAS A GATHERING OF THE CLANS SUCH AS EASTERN MONTANA HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN
BUT IT'S A MISTAKE EVER TO LOOK FOR JACK UNTIL HE'S ACTUALLY IN SIGHT PARK SMILED VAGUELY HE WAS AFRAID IT WOULD NOT BE POLITE TO AGREE WITH HER AS EMPHATICALLY AS HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DONE
ARE YOU COMING SURE PARK ASSENTED THEY GOT UPON THEIR HORSES AND HEADED DOWN THE TRAIL TO THE STEVENS PLACE THURSTON WOULD HAVE PUT SUNFISH TO A RUN BUT PARK CHECKED HIM
DURING THE WINTER WHEN HE DID NOT SEE HER HE COULD BRING HIMSELF TO THINK OCCASIONALLY OF OTHER THINGS AND IT IS A FACT THAT THE STORIES HE WROTE WITH NO HEROINE AT ALL HIT THE MARK THE STRAIGHTEST
FLEERED PARK WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD FRIEND
AND THERE WERE FOUR BEYOND RANGE OF THE LENS PARK CAME ALONG SAW WHAT HE WAS DOING AND LAUGHED
THERE AIN'T A JUNE FLOOD THAT DON'T PUT HIS CORRAL UNDER WATER AND SOME UH THESE DAYS IT'S GOING TO GET THE HOUSE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO DIG A WELL BACK ON HIGH GROUND HE'D RATHER TAKE CHANCES ON HAVING THE WHOLE BUSINESS WASHED OFF THE FACE UH THE EARTH
IT WAS PARK STILL TRYING TO BE POLITE AND NOT COMMIT HIMSELF ON THE SUBJECT OF JACK THE SOME ONE WHOM JACK WENT OFTENEST TO SEE WAS THE BARTENDER IN THE PALACE SALOON BUT IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO TELL HER THAT
HE LAUGHED IN HIS TEASING WAY MONA STOOD UP AND HER SHINING EYES WERE TURNED TO THURSTON I DON'T CARE SHE ASSERTED WITH REDDENED CHEEKS I'M JUST GLAD IT DID GET THROUGH
FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF THE TRIP THURSTON WAS IN THAT FRAME OF MIND WHICH MAKES A MAN WANT TO RIDE BY HIMSELF WITH SHOULDERS HUNCHED MOODILY AND EYES STARING STRAIGHT BEFORE THE NOSE OF HIS HORSE BUT THE SKY WAS SOFT AND SEEMED TO SMILE DOWN AT HIM AND
THAN HE HAD HAD ADMIRING HERS AND THIS WAS SOON DISCOVERED BY THOSE AROUND HER
WITHOUT REALIZING HOW MUCH WRONG AND MISERY WAS CAUSED BY THE LAW WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO THROW A MAN INTO PRISON FOR DEBT NOR CAN ONE READ BLEAK HOUSE WITHOUT SEEING THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM WHICH ROBBED QUAINT MISS FLITE OF HER MIND
ROUND ABOUT ARE CHALK HILLS GREEN LANES FORESTS AND MARSHES AND AMID SUCH SCENES THE LITTLE CHARLES'S GENIUS FIRST BEGAN TO SHOW ITSELF HE DID NOT LIKE THE ROUGHER SPORTS OF HIS SCHOOL FELLOWS
YOU KNOW HE WOULD BE UNHAPPY FOR IT IS ONLY GOODNESS WHICH BRINGS CONTENT YOU ARE RIGHT ANSWERED THE FAIRY BUT THAT I CANNOT DO
ONE DAY HE CARRIED HIS LITTLE PIECE OF BREAD INTO THE GARDEN TO EAT IT THERE BUT WANDERING WITH IT IN HIS MOUTH STILL FURTHER ON
THE ESCAPED CONVICT IN GREAT EXPECTATIONS SO FRIGHTENED LITTLE PIP IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT THE YOUNG CHARLES DICKENS NOTED CAREFULLY AND REMEMBERED EVERYTHING HE SAW AND THIS HABIT WAS OF GREAT USE TO HIM ALL HIS LIFE
BUT HE GREATLY MISSED HIS LONDON FRIENDS HE USED TO SAY THAT BEING WITHOUT THEM WAS LIKE LOSING HIS ARMS AND LEGS THE FIRST GREAT GRIEF OF HIS LIFE CAME TO HIM AT THIS TIME IN THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE'S SISTER MARY HOGARTH
AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SHOUTED WITH JOY AND WISHED HIM A LONG LIFE TO REPAIR THE EVIL BROUGHT ABOUT BY THEIR FORMER SOVEREIGN I ACCEPT THE THRONE SAID SULIMAN
SHE SHOULD BE PLACED WHERE THERE WAS NO OTHER LIGHT THAN THAT OF CANDLES BUT NOW AS THEY DREW NEAR THEIR DESTINATION WHILE IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT THE WICKED WOMAN URGED BY HER ENVIOUS DAUGHTER LONGUE EPINE
THESE HAPPY YEARS WERE NOT TO LAST LONG WHEN HE WAS NINE YEARS OLD HIS FATHER BECAME POOR AND THE FAMILY WAS OBLIGED TO MOVE TO LONDON WHERE IT LIVED IN A SHABBY HOUSE IN A POOR SUBURB
THE IDEA OF GIVING PUBLIC READINGS FROM HIS STORIES SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM AND HE WAS SOON ENGAGED IN PREPARATION I MUST DO SOMETHING HE WROTE OR I SHALL WEAR MY HEART AWAY THAT HEART HIS PHYSICIAN HAD DECLARED OUT OF ORDER
IN THE GREAT PLEASURE WITH WHICH IT READ HIS STORIES DICKENS WAS A VERY ACTIVE MAN AND HIS LIFE WAS SIMPLE AND FULL OF WORK AND EXERCISE HE ROSE EARLY AND ALMOST EVERY DAY MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN TRAMPING FOR MILES ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS
THAT SHE NOW ACCEPTED HIS GIFT AND WOULD LOVE HIM ALWAYS
IT WAS TRULY A SPEAKING LIKENESS OF THE YOUNG PRINCE
AT FIRST THE PRINCE COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD HE SIMPLY GAZED AT HER IN AMAZEMENT THEN HE SAID TURNING TO HIS FATHER WE HAVE BEEN DECEIVED THAT PORTRAIT WAS PAINTED TO MISLEAD US IT WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME
HE LIKED BEST HOWEVER A LITTLE ENGLISH WATERING PLACE CALLED BROADSTAIRS A TINY FISHING VILLAGE BUILT ON A CLIFF WITH THE SEA ROLLING AND DASHING BENEATH IT
HER MAIDS OF HONOUR GIROFLEE LOVED HER PASSIONATELY AND FAITHFULLY BUT LONGUE EPINE WAS FULL OF ENVY OF THE PRINCESS WHO WAS SO GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL AND BESIDES LONGUE EPINE
BUT AT ANY RATE IT IS SECURE FROM THE LIONS BECAFIGUE WENT BACK TO THE PRINCE AND TOGETHER THEY RETURNED TO THE COTTAGE WHERE THEY WERE LED INTO THE ROOM NEXT TO THAT OCCUPIED BY THE PRINCESS NEXT MORNING THE PRINCE AROSE EARLY AND WENT OUT
I WILL LEAD YOU TO A FAIRIES PALACE AND YOUR WISH SHALL BE FULFILLED I WOULD CERTAINLY COME WITH YOU REPLIED THE QUEEN BUT I AM AFRAID THAT I CANNOT WALK BACKWARDS
AND HE CARRIED THE RABBIT TO HIS PALACE AND ORDERED A PRETTY LITTLE HUTCH TO BE MADE FOR IT THAT NIGHT WHEN HE WAS ALONE IN HIS ROOM THERE APPEARED A LOVELY LADY
FOR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SHOULD SHE SUDDENLY CHANGE INTO A PRINCESS THERE IN THE FOREST
AND THIS THE FAIRY PROMISED TO DO MEANWHILE ONCE MORE BECAFIGUE CAME TO THE CAPITAL WHERE DESIREE'S FATHER LIVED AND THROWING HIMSELF AT THE KING'S FEET
AND YET WHOSE MANNERS AND APPEARANCE WERE PICTURED SO REALLY THAT THEY SEEMED TO BE ACTUAL PERSONS WHOM ONE MIGHT MEET AND LAUGH WITH ANYWHERE WITH SUCH A SUCCESS AND THE MONEY IT BROUGHT HIM DICKENS HAD LEISURE TO BEGIN THE WONDERFUL SERIES OF STORIES
HIS FATHER WAS A CLERK IN ONE OF THE OFFICES OF THE NAVY AND HE WAS ONE OF EIGHT CHILDREN WHEN HE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD HIS FATHER MOVED TO THE TOWN OF CHATHAM NEAR THE OLD CITY OF ROCHESTER
AS THE YEARS WENT BY HIS LETTERS TO HIS OLDEST SON TOLD OF HIS OWN WORK AND PLANS WHEN HIS YOUNGEST SON SAILED AWAY TO LIVE IN AUSTRALIA HE WROTE POOR PLORN IS GONE IT WAS A HARD PARTING AT THE LAST
FOR I KNOW THAT THOSE WHO HAVE PITY FOR DUMB CREATURES HAVE STILL MORE PITY FOR MANKIND I HAVE COME TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID AND TO SAY THAT I SHALL ALWAYS BE YOUR FRIEND
HE WAS NOW BOTH FAMOUS AND RICH HE BOUGHT A HOUSE ON GAD'S HILL A PLACE NEAR CHATHAM WHERE HE HAD SPENT THE HAPPIEST PART OF HIS CHILDHOOD AND SETTLED DOWN TO A LIFE OF COMFORT AND LABOR
UNKNOWN TO HIM A LITTLE CHILD OF HIS OWN WAS LYING DEAD AT HOME WITH SUCH A TENDER HEART FOR ALL THE WORLD HE WAS MORE THAN AN AFFECTIONATE FATHER TO HIS OWN CHILDREN AND GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO THEIR HAPPINESS AND EDUCATION
AS FROM THE MOST FAMOUS IT WAS WHILE ENGAGED IN THIS WORK THAT DICKENS WROTE THE BEST ONE OF ALL HIS TALES DAVID COPPERFIELD THE ONE WHICH IS IN SO LARGE A PART THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN EARLY LIFE THIS BOOK BROUGHT DICKENS TO THE HEIGHT OF HIS CAREER
BETTER DAYS HOWEVER CAME AT LAST HE WAS ABLE TO BEGIN SCHOOL AGAIN AND THOUGH THE HEAD MASTER WAS IGNORANT AND BRUTAL JUST SUCH A ONE AS MISTER CREAKLE IN DAVID COPPERFIELD YET DICKENS PROFITED BY SUCH TEACHING AS HE RECEIVED
HE AND HIS WIFE WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN ALL THEIR TASTES AND HABITS AND HAD NEVER LOVED EACH OTHER AS WELL AS PEOPLE SHOULD WHEN THEY MARRY PERHAPS AFTER ALL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD MARRIED HIS DORA
CHARLES DICKENS CHARLES JOHN HUFFHAM DICKENS THE MASTER STORY TELLER WAS BORN IN LANDPORT ENGLAND FEBRUARY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN TWELVE
ALL THAT I CAN PROMISE IS THAT I WILL GIVE HIM GOOD ADVICE AND PUNISH HIM FOR HIS FAULTS IF HE WILL NOT HIMSELF CORRECT THEM AND WITH THIS THE FATHER HAD TO REST CONTENT NOT LONG AFTERWARDS THE GOOD KING DIED
AND SHE SPOKE TO THE FAWN AND THE FAWN OBEYED HER IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE PRINCE COULD NOT DOUBT THAT WHAT SHE SAID WAS TRUE
AND ROBINSON CRUSOE HE HAD A GREAT AFFECTION FOR CHATHAM AND ROCHESTER AND AFTER HE BEGAN TO WRITE STORIES THAT WERE PRINTED HE OFTEN USED TO PUT THESE PLACES INTO THEM
A BABY PRINCESS WAS BORN WHOM SHE NAMED DESIREE THEN TAKING THE BOUQUET INTO HER HAND THE QUEEN ONE BY ONE PRONOUNCED THE NAMES OF THE FLOWERS WHEN THERE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED FLYING THROUGH THE AIR IN ELEGANT CHARIOTS DRAWN BY DIFFERENT KINDS OF BIRDS
THIS PRINCESS NOIRE NOW WENT TO THE FAIRY OF THE FOUNTAIN WHO WAS HER BEST FRIEND
WHILE BECAFIGUE WENT ON FURTHER IN SEARCH OF FRUIT WHEREWITH TO REFRESH HIS ROYAL MASTER IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE WE LEFT THE WHITE FAWN THAT IS TO SAY THE CHARMING PRINCESS VERY DESOLATELY SHE WEPT WHEN IN A STREAM SHE SAW HER FIGURE REFLECTED
HE ATTEMPTED ONE MORE SERIES OF READINGS AND WITH THEIR CLOSE BADE FAREWELL FOR EVER TO HIS ENGLISH AUDIENCE
SO IN A CARRIAGE LIKE A LARGE DARK BOX SHUT UP WITH HER LADY IN WAITING AND HER TWO MAIDS OF HONOUR
ONE DAY WHILE HE WAS OUT HUNTING A LITTLE RABBIT THAT HIS DOGS WERE ABOUT TO KILL THREW ITSELF INTO HIS ARMS THE KING CARESSED THE LITTLE CREATURE AND SAID
BANDAGING UP ONE ARM FROM WHICH THE BLOOD WAS FLOWING THEY BOTH SEEMED GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WOUND
A GENTLE LOVABLE GIRL OF SEVENTEEN NO SORROW EVER TOUCHED HIM AS THIS DID AFTER SHE DIED HE WROTE YEARS AFTERWARD I DREAMED OF HER EVERY NIGHT FOR MANY WEEKS AND ALWAYS WITH A KIND OF QUIET HAPPINESS
SHE THEN ESCORTED THE QUEEN TO THE MOST MAGNIFICENT PALACE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE IMAGINED IT WAS BUILT ENTIRELY OF DIAMONDS IN THIS SUPERB PLACE DWELT SIX FAIRIES WHO RECEIVED THE QUEEN WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT
AND ONE DAY WHEN THIS KEEPER LAY ASLEEP AND A TIGER WHO HAD BROKEN LOOSE WAS ABOUT TO DEVOUR HIM
QUITE LATE IN THE EVENING BECAFIGUE ARRIVED AT THE COTTAGE OF THE GOOD WOMAN
THE ONE WHOM HE HAD PICTURED IN THE LOVE STORY OF DAVID COPPERFIELD AND HIS CHILD WIFE BUT HOWEVER THIS MAY BE DICKENS AND HIS WIFE HAD NOT LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER AND NOW DECIDED TO PART AND FROM THAT TIME THOUGH THEY WROTE TO EACH OTHER HE NEVER SAW HER AGAIN
AND AS EVENING FELL THE FAWN SLIPPED AWAY AND GAINED THE LITTLE HUT
HE ATTEMPTED TO FULFIL BUT HE WAS TOO ILL HE FOUND HIMSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE FEELING AS HE SAID GIDDY JARRED SHAKEN FAINT UNCERTAIN OF VOICE AND SIGHT AND TREAD AND TOUCH
WHEN HE MOVED TO GAD'S HILL IT SEEMED AS THOUGH DICKENS HAD GAINED ALMOST ALL OF THE THINGS MEN STRIVE MOST FOR BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE HAPPY THERE NOR PERHAPS WAS HE EVER AGAIN TO BE REALLY HAPPY ANYWHERE
DICKENS SOON CAME TO REGRET THE WRITING OF THESE CHAPTERS AND WHEN TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER HE VISITED THE UNITED STATES A SECOND TIME HE DID ALL IN HIS POWER TO SHOW HIS KINDLY FEELING AND AMERICA ADMIRED AND LOVED HIM SO MUCH THAT IT GRADUALLY FORGOT THE INCIDENT
I CANNOT RELEASE YOU ALTOGETHER FROM THIS ENCHANTMENT BUT I HAVE POWER TO SHORTEN THE TIME AND ALSO TO SAY THAT DURING THE NIGHT YOU MAY REGAIN YOUR RIGHTFUL FORM BUT BY DAY AGAIN MUST YOU RUN THROUGH THE FOREST AS A FAWN
THE FAIRY ALSO TOLD THEM WHERE THEY COULD FIND A LITTLE HUT IN WHICH TO PASS THE NIGHTS THEN SHE DISAPPEARED
OR RIDING HORSEBACK WITH HIS DOGS RACING AFTER HIM HE LIKED BEST TO WANDER ALONG THE CLIFFS OR ACROSS THE DOWNS BY THE SEA WHEN HE WAS IN LONDON HE OFTEN WALKED THE STREETS HALF THE NIGHT THINKING OUT HIS STORIES
WHOSE ONLY PLEASURE IT WAS TO TORMENT HIS PEOPLE HAD BEEN CRUSHED TO DEATH IN HIS CHAMBER BY A THUNDER BOLT A JUST PUNISHMENT FOR HIS OFFENCES FOUR OF HIS WICKED COMPANIONS HAD TRIED TO PARTITION THE KINGDOM BETWEEN THEM BUT THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE NONE SUCH TO RULE
THE NEXT DAY FOR A LONG TIME SHE HID FROM THE PRINCE BUT AT LAST HE FOUND HER AND AS SHE DASHED OFF HE SHOT AN ARROW WHICH WOUNDED HER IN THE LEG
AND ON HEARING HER ADVENTURE THE MAID OF HONOUR TOLD HER SHE MUST NEVER AGAIN VENTURE OUT BUT THE PRINCESS REPLIED IT IS NO USE TALKING THUS WHEN I AM A FAWN THIS ROOM IS STIFLING TO ME AND I MUST DEPART FROM IT
AS HE SAT DOWN TO DINNER ALL PRESENT NOTICED THAT HE LOOKED VERY ILL THEY BEGGED HIM TO LIE DOWN YES ON THE GROUND HE SAID THESE WERE THE LAST WORDS HE EVER UTTERED AND AS HE SPOKE HE SLIPPED DOWN UPON THE FLOOR
HARDLY HAD SHE PERCEIVED IT WHEN UTTERING A DEEP SIGH SHE THREW HERSELF FROM THE CARRIAGE AND IN THE FORM OF A WHITE FAWN FLEETLY FLED INTO A FOREST NEAR BY THE FAIRY OF THE FOUNTAIN WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF THIS DISASTER
AND ORDERED HIS OFFICERS TO CARRY ZELIE TO THE PALACE BUT SHE WAS NOT USED UNKINDLY THERE FOR THE PRINCE LOVED HER HOWEVER AFTER A WHILE URGED BY HIS FOSTER BROTHER
THE SCEPTRE AND ORB SHE CARRIED IN HER HANDS
AND KEPT POOR RICHARD CARSTONE FROM HIS FORTUNE TILL THE FORTUNE ITSELF HAD DISAPPEARED WAS A VERY WRONG LEGAL SYSTEM INDEED OFTEN TOO DICKENS'S STORIES ARE IN A SENSE SERMONS AGAINST VERY HUMAN SINS
DICKENS'S LIFE AT THIS TIME WAS SO MISERABLE THAT ALWAYS AFTERWARD HE DREADED TO SPEAK OF IT AND NEVER COULD BEAR EVEN TO WALK IN THE STREET WHERE THE BLACKING WAREHOUSE OF HIS BOYHOOD HAD STOOD
AND SO IT WAS AGREED AND HENRIETTE SUCCESSFULLY LANDED MISSUS SHADD'S MUSICALE INCIDENTALLY JOCKOBINSKI WAS VERY AFFABLE AND THE FUNCTION WENT OFF WELL
I ATTEMPTED TO SOUND HENRIETTE ON THE SUBJECT I SHOULD LIKE FRIDAY EVENING OFF MISSUS VAN RAFFLES SAID I IF YOU ARE GOING TO MISSUS SHADD'S MUSICALE YOU WILL HAVE NO USE FOR ME SHUT UP BUNNY SHE RETURNED ABRUPTLY I SHALL NEED YOU FRIDAY NIGHT MORE THAN EVER BEFORE
BUT ASSURING HIM THAT I WASN'T AWARE THAT AN ANSWER WAS EXPECTED I RETURNED TO BOLIVAR LODGE
AND ATTENDED TO THE WHOLE THING AND NOW I COME BACK TO FIND IT ALL A ER A MISTAKE WHY PAULINE IT'S POSITIVELY AWFUL WHAT CAN WE DO HENRIETTE WAS A PERFECT PICTURE OF DESPAIR I DON'T SUPPOSE WE CAN DO ANYTHING NOW SAID MISSUS SHADD RUEFULLY
EJACULATED MISSUS SHADD HER EYES BEGINNING TO TWINKLE

BUT TO ROB A NEIGHBOR OF HER COOK IF THERE IS ANY WORSE SOCIAL CRIME THAN THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU'D BETTER THINK TWICE ON THAT PROPOSITION HENRIETTE I ADVISED WITH A GLOOMY SHAKE OF THE HEAD IT IS NOT ONLY A MEAN CRIME BUT A DANGEROUS ONE TO BOOT
BUNNY CRIED HENRIETTE WITH A SILVERY RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER DO BE CAREFUL AN EPIGRAM FROM YOU MY DEAR BOY YOU'LL BE DOWN WITH BRAIN FEVER IF YOU DON'T WATCH OUT HUMPH SAID I WITH A SHRUG OF MY SHOULDERS
SHE WAS RADIANT AND TRIUMPHANT I WON OUT BUNNY I WON OUT SHE CRIED

I MUST TAKE THE FIRST TRAIN FOR NEW YORK SHE SAID EXCITEDLY YOU WILL HAVE THE MUSIC ROOM PREPARED AT ONCE BUNNY MISSUS SHADD'S MUSICALE WILL BE GIVEN HERE I AM GOING MYSELF TO MAKE ALL THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS AT THE NEW YORK END
AND THEIR ABILITY TO GIVE BONDS TO KEEP IT UP THE VAN VARICK SHADDS FLOWED IN THROUGH THEIR UNQUESTIONED AFFILIATION WITH THE EVER POPULAR DELAWARE SHADDS AND THE ROE SHADDS OF THE HUDSON TWO OF THE OLDEST AND MOST RESPECTED FAMILIES OF THE UNITED STATES
SHE'S THAT EASY WITH MEN THAT EVEN I TREMBLE WITH ANXIETY WHENEVER SHE COMES INTO THE HOUSE BUT HOW DO THEY LIVE THEY HAVEN'T A CENT TO THEIR NAMES SAID HENRIETTE SIMPLICITY ITSELF SAID I HE IS DRESSED BY HIS TAILORS AND SHE BY HER DRESSMAKER

IN REPLY TO YOUR NOTE OF WEDNESDAY EVENING SAID HENRIETTE
AND I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT AT LAST HENRIETTE HAD REACHED THE END OF HER INGENUITY THOUGH FOR MY OWN PART I COULD NOT BLAME HER IF SHE FAILED TO FIND SOME PLAUSIBLE WAY OUT OF HER DISAPPOINTMENT WEDNESDAY NIGHT CAME AND CONSUMED BY CURIOSITY TO LEARN JUST HOW THE MATTER STOOD
SHE ASKED WITH A GRIN BUNDERBY NO SAID I YOU'VE GUESSED RIGHT SAID HENRIETTE AS A POSTSCRIPT LET ME SAY THAT UNTIL HE READS THIS I DON'T BELIEVE TOMMY DARE EVER GUESSED WHAT A SUCCESSFUL JOKE HE PERPETRATED UPON MISSUS SHADD AND THE FAIR HENRIETTE
EVEN AS MISSUS INNITT SPOKE I CONVEYED A LUSCIOUS MORSEL OF FILET MIGNON WITH MUSHROOMS TO MY MOUTH AND NEARLY BROKE MY TOOTH ON A PIECE OF GRAVEL THAT WENT WITH IT AND NORAH WAS DOOMED FOR ALTHOUGH WE ALL LAUGHED HEARTILY
AND DESPITE MY REMONSTRANCES SHE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM THE TABLE FOR A MOMENT AND I JUDGE FROM THE FLUSHED APPEARANCE OF HER CHEEKS WHEN SHE RETURNED FIVE MINUTES LATER THAT SOMEBODY HAD HAD THE RIOT ACT READ TO HER SOMEWHERE
THERE NEVER WERE SUCH PANCAKES SUCH PUREES SUCH MADE DISHES AS THAT WOMAN GETS UP SHE TURNS HASH INTO A CONFECTION AND LIVER AND BACON INTO A DELICACY
FOR IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT MISSUS SHADD WAS MAD ALL THROUGH IN SPITE OF MY STUPIDITY I RATHER THOUGHT I COULD DIVINE THE CAUSE TOO SHE WAS NOT KEPT LONG IN WAITING FOR TEN MINUTES LATER THE AUTOMOBILE WITH HENRIETTE IN IT CAME THUNDERING UP THE DRIVE
WENT AT ONCE TO HERR JOCKOBINSKI'S AGENT AND ARRANGED THE CHANGE
BUT IN THIS MISSUS VAN RAFFLES YOU'LL HAVE TO GO IT ALONE OH DON'T YOU BE AFRAID BUNNY SHE ANSWERED I'M NOT GOING TO USE YOUR CHARMS AS A BAIT TO LURE THIS CULINARY PHYLLIS INTO THE ARCADIA IN WHICH YOU
IT WOULDN'T BE UNLIKE HIM WOULD IT NOT A BIT THE NAUGHTY BOY CRIED MISSUS SHADD THAT'S IT MISSUS VAN RAFFLES AS CERTAINLY AS WE STAND HERE SUPPOSE JUST TO WORRY HIM WE NEVER LET ON THAT ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY HAS HAPPENED EH
YES WELL HE GOT INTO THE SWIM WITH EACH MARRIAGE SO HE'S GOT A FOUR PLY GRIP SAID I AND THE DEDBROKE HICKSES ASKED HENRIETTE HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THEM MOST ATTRACTIVE DINERS AND WEEKENDERS SAID I
WHY AM I GIVING THE MUSICALE TO NIGHT THEN INSTEAD OF YOU THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I HAVE COME TO FIND OUT SAID MISSUS SHADD
BUT HER LITTLE DINNERS ARE THE SWELLEST THINGS OF THE SEASON NEVER MORE THAN TEN PEOPLE AT A TIME AND EVERYTHING COOKED TO A TURN THAT'S JUST IT SAID I I HEAR ENOUGH AT THE CLUB TO KNOW JUST WHAT CINCHES MISSUS INNITT'S POSITION IT'S HER COOK THAT'S WHAT DOES IT
WHEN ONE OF THE TWO HAIR PINS TURNED UP IN THE POMPANO TO THE SUPREME DISGUST OF MY HOSTESS WHO WAS NOW BEGINNING TO LOOK WORRIED HAIR PIN NUMBER TWO MADE ITS DEBUT IN MY TIMBALE THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE WATCHFUL MISSUS INNITT SELF POISED THOUGH SHE ALWAYS IS
IT WAS DELIVERED BY YOUR OWN MAN BLUNDERBY I THINK HIS NAME IS ABOUT HALF PAST SEVEN O'CLOCK IT WAS WEDNESDAY YES BUNDERBY DID CARRY A NOTE TO YOU FROM ME ON WEDNESDAY SAID MISSUS SHADD BUT
AND IT NEARLY CHOKED ME TO DEATH I TRIED HARD TO KEEP MISSUS INNITT FROM SEEING WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT SHE IS WATCHFUL IF NOT BRAINY AND ALL MY EFFORTS WENT FOR NAUGHT SHE WAS MUCH MORTIFIED OF COURSE AND APOLOGIZED PROFUSELY ALL WENT WELL UNTIL THE FISH
MISSUS INNITT BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS AND WELL TO MORROW BUNNY NORAH LEAVES YOU WILL TAKE HER THIS TEN DOLLAR BILL FROM ME
I CONFESSED TO HAVING READ SOMETHING ABOUT SUCH AN INCIDENT IN HIGH SOCIETY WELL SAID HENRIETTE THIS WOULD HAVE THROWN THAT LITTLE EPISODE WHOLLY IN THE SHADE
I WOULDN'T PITY THEM IF I WERE YOU THEY'RE HAPPY MISSUS INNITT THOUGH I ENVY HER SAID HENRIETTE THAT IS IN A WAY
EVERYBODY WAS THERE AND NO ONE WOULD FOR A MOMENT HAVE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING STRANGE IN THE TRANSFER OF THE SCENE FROM ONYX HOUSE TO BOLIVAR LODGE WHO WROTE THAT LETTER HENRIETTE I ASKED LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN THE LAST GUEST HAD GONE WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE BUNNY MY BOY
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE IT SAID MISSUS SHADD
AND ARE WILLING TO SERVE FOR NOTHING FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITEMS THE CONNECTION GIVES THEM WELL I DON'T ENVY THEM IN THE LEAST SAID HENRIETTE POOR THINGS TO BE ALWAYS TAKING AND NEVER GIVING MUST BE AN AWFUL STRAIN
FULL OF SYMPATHY AS I HAD ALWAYS BEEN WITH THE PROJECTS OF MISSUS VAN RAFFLES AND NEVER IN THE LEAST OBJECTING ON MORAL GROUNDS TO ANY OF HER SCHEMES OF ACQUISITION I COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT THIS TIME SHE PROPOSED TO GO TOO FAR
SURELY YOU GOT MY NOTE SAYING THAT I WOULD LET JOCKOBINSKI PLAY HERE TO NIGHT INSTEAD OF I DID RECEIVE A VERY PECULIAR NOTE FROM YOU SAYING THAT YOU WOULD GLADLY DO AS I WISHED SAID MISSUS SHADD BEGINNING HERSELF TO LOOK LESS ANGRY AND MORE PUZZLED
THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET BACK IN TIME FOR TO NIGHT'S AFFAIR AND WOULDN'T I TAKE IT OVER PROTESTED MISSUS VAN RAFFLES VEHEMENTLY I SAID MISSUS SHADD SHOWING MORE SURPRISE THAN WAS COMPATIBLE WITH HER HIGH SOCIAL POSITION AND ATTEND TO ALL THE DETAILS
WHERE COULD IT HAVE COME FROM I SUPPOSED IT CAME FROM ONYX HOUSE SAID HENRIETTE SIMPLY GLANCING AT THE ENVELOPE WELL IT'S A VERY MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR SAID MISSUS SHADD RISING AND I OH WELL MY DEAR WOMAN I
AND ALL THE WEALTHY FAMILIES OF NEWPORT VIED WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING FIRST TO WELCOME HIM TO OUR SHORES NOT BECAUSE HE WAS A FREAK MIND YOU BUT FOR ART'S SWEET SAKE MISSUS GUSHINGTON ANDREWS OFFERED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR HIM AS A WEEK END GUEST
INSULTED ANOTHER DAY IN PUBLIC BY A MAGISTRATE WHOSE INTERESTS HE HAD REFUSED TO FORWARD
BUT WHEN IT HAS THIS SPIRIT IT WILL BE FIT FOR THE PURPOSES OF GOD YET IN SPITE OF ALL THAT SUCH A VOCATION MEANT OF SELF RENUNCIATION YEAR AFTER YEAR THE MISSION PRIESTS INCREASED IN NUMBER
WHOM THE ONCE DREADED COUNT INSISTED ON SERVING WITH HIS OWN HANDS HE DIED THE DEATH OF A SAINT A FEW YEARS LATER AMID THE BLESSINGS OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHOM HE HAD HELPED THE LADIES OF THE PARISH
WHO LEFT A WIDOW AT THE AGE OF TWENTY DEVOTED HERSELF AND HER ENORMOUS FORTUNE TO ALMS AND GOOD WORKS
WHO PROMPTLY MADE VINCENT DE PAUL ALMONER TO THE KING'S SHIPS WITH THE HONORS AND PRIVILEGES OF A NAVAL OFFICER AND A SALARY OF SIX HUNDRED LIVRES
WHOSE SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD CONDUCT BAFFLED THE WILY AND DEFEATED THEIR PLANS BUT AN ATTEMPT TO GET HIM EJECTED FROM THE COUNCIL MET WITH SUCH STORMY OPPOSITION THAT THE PRIME MINISTER DETERMINED TO CHANGE HIS TACTICS
BUT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS LEAVING THAT WORLD WHERE HE HAD SHONE SO BRILLIANTLY
AT VINCENT'S EARNEST REQUEST MONEY WAS COLLECTED AMONG HIS FRIENDS AND PATRONS AND A HOSPITAL BUILT WHERE THE PRISONERS CONDEMNED TO THE GALLEYS MIGHT BE NURSED INTO GOOD HEALTH BEFORE THEY WENT ON BOARD
HE THEN TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE CLERGY ALREADY THERE THEY WERE IGNORANT AND EASYGOING MEN FOR THE MOST PART WHO THOUGHT A GOOD DEAL MORE OF THEIR OWN AMUSEMENT THAN OF THE NEEDS OF THEIR FLOCK BUT THEY WERE NOT BAD AT HEART
VINCENT'S RECEPTION OF THESE PROPOSALS WAS DISCONCERTING GOD FORBID HE WOULD CRY INDIGNANTLY BETTER THAT WE SHOULD ALL GO WITHOUT THE BAREST NECESSITIES OF LIFE SOME WOULD COME WITH A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE QUEEN HERSELF WHICH MADE THINGS DOUBLY EMBARRASSING
THE BLESSING OF GOD SEEMED INDEED TO REST UPON THE ORDINATION RETREATS NEARLY ALL WHO MADE THEM CARRIED AWAY SOMETHING OF VINCENT'S NOBLE IDEAL OF THE PRIESTLY LIFE MANY TO WHOM THEY HAD BEEN THE TURNING POINT OF A LIFETIME
MOREOVER HE HAD TAKEN HIS OWN WAY IN GOING TO CHATILLON WAS HE SURE THAT IT WAS GOD'S WAY VINCENT WAS HUMBLE ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT HE MIGHT BE IN THE WRONG
THEN NOTICING THE HESITATION OF THE QUEEN MADAME HE SAID HOTLY THIS MAN WHOM YOU INTEND TO MAKE A BISHOP SPENDS HIS LIFE IN PUBLIC HOUSES AND IS CARRIED HOME DRUNK EVERY NIGHT
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT WAS THE ONLY ANSWER ACCOMPANIED BY A GOOD NATURED SMILE
WHEREAS IN REFUSING TO RETURN TO THE DE GONDIS HE WAS NEGLECTING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DOING GOOD ON A VERY MUCH LARGER SCALE HELPED BY THEIR MONEY AND THEIR INFLUENCE NOT ONLY THEIR VAST ESTATES BUT PARIS ITSELF LAY OPEN TO HIM AS A FIELD FOR HIS LABORS
HE WOULD USE HIS MERRY WIT TO MAKE FUN OF THE POMPOUS PREACHERS WHOSE ONLY THOUGHT WAS TO IMPRESS THEIR AUDIENCE WITH AN IDEA OF THEIR OWN ELOQUENCE OF WHAT GOOD IS A DISPLAY OF RHETORIC HE WOULD ASK WHO IS THE BETTER FOR IT IT SERVES NO PURPOSE BUT SELF ADVERTISEMENT
HIS FIRST STEP WAS TO BE RECONCILED TO THE CHURCH HIS SECOND TO BEGIN TO INTEREST HIMSELF IN THE POOR GRADUALLY HIS BAD COMPANIONS DROPPED AWAY
I AM A WRETCH AND A SINNER HE CRIED BUT TELL ME WHAT TO DO AND I WILL DO IT
THIS STRANGE NEW FRIEND WHO WENT ABOUT AMONG THEM KISSING THEIR CHAINS SYMPATHIZING WITH THEIR SUFFERINGS AND ATTENDING TO THEIR LOWEST NEEDS SEEMED TO THEM LIKE AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN EVEN THE MOST HARDENED COULD NOT RESIST SUCH TREATMENT
SHE APPLIED TO FATHER DE BERULLE TO USE HIS INFLUENCE IN THE MATTER AND THUS OBTAINED HER DESIRE AT VINCENT'S SUGGESTION SHE SOON AFTERWARDS UNDERTOOK CERTAIN WORKS OF CHARITY WHICH WERE DESTINED TO BE THE SEED OF A GREAT ENTERPRISE
THE FIRST ADVANCES WERE MET WITH CURSING AND BLASPHEMY BUT VINCENT WAS NOT TO BE DISCOURAGED WITH HIS OWN GENTLE CHARITY HE PERFORMED THE LOWEST OFFICES FOR THESE POOR WRETCHES TO WHOM HIS HEART WENT OUT WITH SUCH AN ARDENT PITY
HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE QUEEN WAS GROWING DAILY BUT IT WAS NOT YET STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERRIDE ALL HER SCRUPLES SHE WAS A GOOD NATURED WOMAN QUITE READY TO DO RIGHT WHEN IT WAS NOT TOO INCONVENIENT AND IT WAS CLEAR TO HER THAT OF LATE YEARS
ACKNOWLEDGING HIS GUILT ALSO TO MADAME DE GONDI WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM AFTER VINCENT HAD DEPARTED AH MADAME HE CRIED IF I HAD NOT MADE THAT GENERAL CONFESSION MY SOUL WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST FOR ALL ETERNITY
MEMBERS WERE PLEDGED TO OFFER THEIR LIVES COMPLETELY TO GOD AND TO RENOUNCE ALL SELF INTEREST NEVERTHELESS THEY INCREASED RAPIDLY IN NUMBER AND THE CONFERENCES WERE ATTENDED BY ALL THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PRIESTS IN PARIS
HE CONSIDERED THAT BISHOPRICS AND ABBEYS WERE USEFUL THINGS TO KEEP IN RESERVE AS BRIBES FOR HIS WAVERING ADHERENTS CERTAIN REFORMS ON WHICH VINCENT INSISTED WERE NOT TO HIS MIND EITHER
THERE WAS NO WANT OF CHARITY BUT IT NEEDED ORGANIZATION
HE OWED TOO MUCH TO DE BERULLE TO REFUSE SETTING OUT FROM CLICHY WITH HIS WORLDLY GOODS ON A HAND BARROW HE ARRIVED AT THE ORATORY
AND WAS SHOWN INTO THE QUEEN'S PRESENCE OH SAID HER MAJESTY NOT WITHOUT SOME EMBARRASSMENT
AND ANY SON OF POOR PARENTS WHO SHOWED A VOCATION FOR THE PRIESTHOOD WAS TAKEN INTO THE PRESBYTERY AND TAUGHT BY VINCENT HIMSELF THE PARISH CHURCH WHICH WAS IN GREAT DISREPAIR WAS REBUILT OLD STANDING QUARRELS WERE MADE UP
PITEOUSLY URGING HIM TO RETURN
AND AT DE BERULLE'S REQUEST CHOSE VINCENT DE PAUL AS HIS SUCCESSOR HERE AMIDST HIS BELOVED POOR VINCENT WAS COMPLETELY HAPPY
IN THE MEANTIME THROUGH THE GENEROSITY OF VINCENT'S FRIENDS HOSPITALS WERE BEING BUILT
AND THESE TWO INSTITUTIONS THE FIRST OF THE FAMOUS SEMINARIES WHICH WERE LATER TO SPREAD ALL OVER FRANCE WERE POWERFUL FOR THE REFORM OF THE CLERGY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS LATER THE MISSION PRIESTS OF SAINT LAZARE ALONE WERE AT THE HEAD OF SIXTY SUCH SEMINARIES
TO WHAT LENGTHS THE AFFECTION OF A MOTHER FOR HER SON WILL GO
THE MISSION PRIESTS DID GOOD WHEREVER THEY WENT EVERYBODY WANTED THEM
BUT THE NEW RECTOR HAD HIS OWN IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT
SO THE WORK OF THE CONGREGATION INCREASED AND MULTIPLIED UNTIL IT SEEMED ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR HUMAN CAPACITY BUT VINCENT KNEW WHEREIN LAY THE STRENGTH OF THE MISSION PRIESTS
FOR THEY ARE MORE LEARNED THAN YOU THEY HAVE READ OR HEARD IT ALL BEFORE IT IS BY WHAT THEY SEE OF YOUR LIVES THAT YOU WILL HELP THEM IF YOU YOURSELVES ARE STRIVING FOR PERFECTION GOD WILL USE YOU TO LEAD THESE GENTLEMEN IN THE RIGHT WAY
VINCENT WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A LIFE SPENT IN EARNEST WORK AMONG HIS PEOPLE WHEN A SUMMONS FROM FATHER DE BERULLE RECALLED HIM SUDDENLY TO PARIS
I SHOULD LIKE MY CHILDREN TO BE SAINTS RATHER THAN GREAT NOBLEMEN SAID MADAME DE GONDI WHEN SHE PRESENTED THE BOYS TO THEIR TUTOR BUT THE PROSPECT SEEMED REMOTE ENOUGH THE VIOLENT TEMPER AND OBSTINACY OF HIS CHARGES WERE A GREAT TRIAL TO VINCENT
MADAME DE GONDI HERSELF SETTING THE EXAMPLE OF WHAT A PERFECT LADY OF CHARITY SHOULD BE NEITHER DIRT DISCOURTESY NOR RISK OF INFECTION COULD DISCOURAGE THIS EARNEST DISCIPLE OF VINCENT IN SPITE OF WEAK HEALTH SHE GAVE FREELY OF HER TIME HER ENERGY AND HER MONEY
THE ANSWER WAS NOTEWORTHY FOR A SCRUPULOUS CLEANLINESS WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE LONG GALLERIES OF THE LOUVRE
WEEKLY GATHERINGS WERE HELD AT SAINT LAZARE UNDER THE NAME OF TUESDAY CONFERENCES
SHE ASKED IT OF THE ARCHBISHOP WHOM SHE HAD INTERESTED IN HER SCHEME AND WHO PROPOSED TO VINCENT TO UNDERTAKE THE FOUNDATION THERE WAS NO LONGER ROOM FOR HESITATION THE WILL OF GOD SEEMED PLAIN
HIS WORK AS A TUTOR HAD BEEN A FAILURE HE TOLD HIM HE COULD DO NOTHING WITH HIS PUPILS AND HE WAS RECEIVING HONOR WHICH HE IN NO WAY DESERVED HE ENDED BY BEGGING TO BE ALLOWED TO WORK FOR THE POOR IN SOME HUMBLE AND LONELY PLACE
HE EVEN APPLIED TO THE QUEEN IN PERSON TO BEG HER TO RECONSIDER HER DECISION BUT ANNE WAS OBDURATE AND VINCENT WAS FORCED TO YIELD I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE WORTHY OF COMPASSION OR IN GREATER NEED OF PRAYERS THAN NOW
THEY WERE TO LIVE FOR THEIR MISSION TWO SERMONS WERE TO BE PREACHED DAILY SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE GREAT TRUTHS AND THOSE WHO HAD NOT YET MADE THEIR FIRST COMMUNION WERE TO BE CATECHIZED THE MISSION LASTED TEN OR FOURTEEN DAYS
CHAINED TO THEIR OARS NIGHT AND DAY KEPT IN ORDER BY CRUEL CUTS OF THE LASH ON THEIR BARE SHOULDERS THESE MEN LIVED AND DIED ON THE ROWERS BENCH WITHOUT SPIRITUAL HELP OR ASSISTANCE OF ANY KIND
WHO USED THEM AS OF OLD FOR HIS OWN ENDS VINCENT DE PAUL IN BITTER GRIEF AND SORROW WAS FORCED TO WITNESS AN ABUSE THAT HE HAD NO LONGER ANY POWER TO CHECK I FEAR HE WROTE IN AFTER YEARS TO A FRIEND
THIS MAN CAME ONE DAY OUT OF CURIOSITY TO HEAR HIM PREACH SURPRISED AND TOUCHED IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE DETERMINED TO MAKE THE PREACHER'S ACQUAINTANCE AND HASTENING INTO HIS PRESENCE FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE HIM
THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT OF ALL IS THAT WE SHOULD BE IN TOUCH WITH OUR LORD IN PRAYER DEAREST TO HIS HEART OF ALL HIS UNDERTAKINGS WAS THE FIRST AND CHIEF WORK OF THE CONGREGATION THE HOLDING OF MISSIONS FOR THE POOR
HE WROTE TO ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AND HIS FOREBODINGS WERE NOT WITHOUT CAUSE IF MAZARIN HAD BEEN UNABLE TO PREVENT THE QUEEN FROM NAMING VINCENT AS ONE OF THE COUNCIL OF CONSCIENCE HE HAD AT LEAST SUCCEEDED IN SECURING HIS OWN NOMINATION
AND WHICH WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE HE HAD YOU ARE NOT GOING TO THE PALACE IN THAT CASSOCK CRIED ONE OF THE MISSION PRIESTS IN CONSTERNATION WHY NOT REPLIED VINCENT QUIETLY IT IS NEITHER STAINED NOR TORN
HIS SWORD WHICH HAD SERVED HIM IN ALL HIS DUELS AND TO WHICH HE WAS VERY MUCH ATTACHED HE BROKE IN PIECES ON A ROCK HIS GREAT CHATEAU THE WALLS OF WHICH HAD RUNG TO THE SOUND OF WILD CAROUSALS
WELL DID VINCENT KNOW THAT HE WAS NO MATCH FOR SUCH A DIPLOMATIST BUT HAVING ONCE REALIZED THAT THE DUTY MUST BE UNDERTAKEN HE DETERMINED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FLINCHING HE WENT TO COURT IN THE OLD CASSOCK IN WHICH HE WENT ABOUT HIS DAILY WORK
VINCENT MET THEM IN THE SAME SPIRIT AND CONQUERED BY THE SAME MEANS THE FACT THAT HE HAD ONCE BEEN A SLAVE HIMSELF GAVE HIM AN INSIGHT INTO THE SUFFERINGS OF THE GALLEY SLAVES AND A WONDERFUL INFLUENCE OVER THEM ACCUSTOMED AS THEY WERE TO BE LOOKED UPON AS BRUTES
UNLESS THE CONGREGATION OF THE MISSION IS HUMBLE SAID VINCENT AND REALIZES THAT IT CAN ACCOMPLISH NOTHING OF ANY VALUE BUT THAT IT IS MORE APT TO MAR THAN TO MAKE IT WILL NEVER BE OF MUCH EFFECT
THIS ENABLED VINCENT TO CARRY HIS MISSION FARTHER AFIELD AND HE DETERMINED TO VISIT ALL THE CONVICT PRISONS IN THE SEAPORT TOWNS TAKING MARSEILLES AS HIS FIRST STATION HERE WHERE THE CONDITIONS WERE PERHAPS EVEN WORSE THAN IN PARIS
CHATILLON LES DOMBES WAS IN NEED OF EARNEST WORKERS VINCENT LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND SET TO WORK AT ONCE THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE WAS TO CLEAN OUT THE CHURCH WHICH WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF DIRT AND SQUALOR THAT PEOPLE HAD SOME EXCUSE FOR NOT WISHING TO ENTER IT
AT LAST VINCENT'S DESIRE SEEMED ABOUT TO BE FULFILLED A FRIEND OF DE BERULLE'S CURE OF THE COUNTRY PARISH OF CLICHY NEAR PARIS ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF ENTERING THE ORATORY
FOR FEVERS PLAGUE AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES OF EVERY KIND RAGED IN THE FILTHY CONVICT PRISONS AND MANY PRIESTS AND LAY HELPERS DIED OF THE INFECTION YET OTHER DEVOTED WORKERS WERE ALWAYS FOUND TO TAKE THEIR PLACE
FELT THE NEED OF FURTHER HELP AND INSTRUCTION FROM THE MAN WHO HAD AWAKENED ALL THAT WAS NOBLEST IN THEIR NATURES TO MEET THIS NECESSITY VINCENT INAUGURATED A KIND OF GUILD FOR YOUNG PRIESTS WHO DESIRE TO LIVE
AFTER THE MOVE TO SAINT LAZARE THE UNDERTAKING HAD GROWN AND PROSPERED
IT WAS STIPULATED HOWEVER THAT HE SHOULD REMAIN AS HE HAD ALREADY PROMISED IN THE HOUSE OF THE FOUNDERS A CONDITION WHICH SEEMED LIKELY TO DOOM THE ENTERPRISE TO FAILURE
EACH IN TURN PROMISING TO PROVIDE A DAY'S FOOD FOR STARVING FAMILIES THUS
SEIZING A HEAVY STOOL SHE FLUNG IT AT THE HEAD OF THE UNWELCOME MESSENGER WHO BOWED AND RETIRED FROM THE HOUSE WITH THE BLOOD STREAMING FROM A WOUND IN HIS FOREHEAD
AFTER HIS FRIEND HAD UNDRESSED HIM D'ARTAGNAN GOT INTO HIS OWN BED SAYING TO HIMSELF MORDIOUX
AND WHO HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE RUMBLING OF A COUPLE OF THOUSAND VEHICLES EVERY DAY AND TO THE SOULLESS TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FOOT PASSENGERS BUT LIVING SAID PORTHOS LIVING REMEMBER THAT
SHE PLACED HER TWO THOUSAND FLORINS IN MY ESTABLISHMENT
ANY ONE WHO HAD THE DISTINGUISHED HONOR OF BEING NEAR HIM COULD WISH TO LEAVE HIM SIRE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
IT WAS JUST SUCH A COMPLIMENT D'ARTAGNAN WOULD CHOOSE WHERE HE DID NOT FEEL DISPOSED TO PAY ANY OTHER
OH SAID PLANCHET MOUSQUETON IS NOT DEAD AND YET MONSIEUR LE BARON IS VERY FOND OF HIM
WHY I FEEL IT DOES ME GOOD TO CONTEMPLATE A FEW DEAD UPON MY WORD SAID D'ARTAGNAN
SO THAT MONSIEUR LE BARON CONTINUED THE GROCER
REPLIED PLANCHET SOMEWHAT HUMILIATED BUT A COUNTRY BOX AH AH I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE MODEST NO MONSIEUR LE BARON I SPEAK THE PLAIN TRUTH I HAVE ROOMS FOR A COUPLE OF FRIENDS THAT'S ALL
FOR THE MORROW BUT THE GROCER HAD A HEART OF GOLD EVER MINDFUL OF THE GOOD OLD TIMES A TRAIT THAT CARRIES YOUTH INTO OLD AGE SO PLANCHET NOTWITHSTANDING A SORT OF INTERNAL SHIVER CHECKED AS SOON AS EXPERIENCED
AND YET PLANCHET FANCIED THAT IN TOKEN OF TACIT APPROVAL HE SAW HIM IMPERCEPTIBLY SMILE AT THE WORD STUPID THIS EMBOLDENED HIM TO SAY ARE YOU ASLEEP MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN NO PLANCHET I AM NOT EVEN ASLEEP REPLIED THE MUSKETEER
AT THE SOUND OF THIS GIGANTIC VOICE THE CAT TOOK FLIGHT
THEY HAD NEVER HEARD THAT AN OGRE WAS EVER CALLED MONSIEUR LE BARON I WILL TAKE A FEW BISCUITS TO EAT ON THE ROAD SAID PORTHOS CARELESSLY AND HE EMPTIED A WHOLE JAR OF ANISEED BISCUITS INTO THE HUGE POCKET OF HIS DOUBLET
AND YET MONSIEUR YOU HAVE A LOOK OUT UPON THE STREET YES AND WONDERFULLY INTERESTING THAT IS OF COURSE BUT IT IS NO LESS TRUE MONSIEUR THAT
WHICH MADE THE ANIMAL'S LEGS ALMOST GIVE WAY D'ARTAGNAN BURST OUT LAUGHING AS HE SAID TAKE CARE PLANCHET
WHENEVER ANY ONE ASKED HIM HOW DO YOU INTEND TO DRESS YOURSELF THIS EVENING HE REPLIED I SHALL UNDRESS MYSELF AT WHICH THE LADIES ALL LAUGHED
A POOR FRANCISCAN MENDICANT FRIAR REPLIED THE LATTER WHO HAD NOT EVEN A DOG TO LOVE HIM IN THIS WORLD AND TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO HIS LAST RESTING PLACE IF THAT WERE REALLY THE CASE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN
NEARLY AS BEAUTIFUL AS MY FOREST AT BERRY PLANCHET OPENED HIS EYES VERY WIDE
BETWEEN THE TWO A SMALL DOOR WITH A PORCH SUPPORTED BY A COUPLE OF PILLARS FORMED THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE THE DOOR WAS GAINED BY A STEP RAISED A LITTLE FROM THE GROUND
SEEMED AS IF HE HAD CEASED TO BE A SOLDIER AS IF HE WERE NO LONGER AN OFFICER BELONGING TO THE PALACE BUT WAS ON THE CONTRARY A QUIET EASY GOING CITIZEN IN A STATE OF STAGNATION BETWEEN HIS DINNER AND SUPPER OR BETWEEN HIS SUPPER AND HIS BED
I AM A GREAT STICKLER FOR A GOOD VIEW MYSELF SAID PORTHOS
A PERFUME OF SPICES MINGLED WITH ANOTHER PERFUME LESS EXOTIC BUT MORE PENETRATING NAMELY THAT WHICH AROSE FROM THE STREET ASCENDED TO SALUTE THE NOSTRILS OF THE MUSKETEER D'ARTAGNAN RECLINING IN AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIR WITH HIS LEGS NOT STRETCHED OUT
THINKS AH
WHILST THE FOLIAGE OF JASMINE AND CLIMBING ROSES HUNG IN MASSES FROM THE WINDOW FRAMES SPLENDIDLY ILLUMINATED A DAMASK TABLE CLOTH AS WHITE AS SNOW THE TABLE WAS LAID FOR TWO PERSONS AMBER COLORED WINE SPARKLED IN A LONG CUT GLASS BOTTLE
IF THAT BE THE CASE MY DEAR PLANCHET I WILL DO SO CERTAINLY REPLIED PORTHOS AND
SHE RAN AWAY FROM A BRUTE OF A HUSBAND WHO WAS IN THE HABIT OF BEATING HER BEING MYSELF A PICARD BORN I WAS ALWAYS VERY FOND OF THE ARTESIAN WOMEN AND IT IS ONLY A STEP FROM ARTOIS TO FLANDERS
THE GLASS OF WHICH COULD HARDLY BE SEEN FOR THE THICK COATING OF DUST WHICH COVERED THEM PORTHOS'S HEART BEGAN TO EXPAND AS HE SAID I AM HUNGRY AND HE SAT HIMSELF BESIDE MADAME TRUCHEN WHOM HE LOOKED AT IN THE MOST KILLING MANNER
AND ALSO TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE D'ARTAGNAN ASKED THE KING FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR A MATTER OF PRIVATE BUSINESS AT THE MOMENT D'ARTAGNAN MADE HIS REQUEST
WHAT SAID PORTHOS TO D'ARTAGNAN AS HE TURNED ROUND ARE YOU GOING TO REMAIN HERE YES I WILL JOIN YOU PRESENTLY
IF I HAD ANY I SHOULD BE FAR FROM REJECTING THEM SAID PLANCHET BUT POSSESSING ONLY THIS LITTLE CEMETERY FULL OF FLOWERS SO MOSS GROWN SHADY AND QUIET I AM CONTENTED WITH IT AND I THINK OF THOSE WHO LIVE IN TOWN IN THE RUE DES LOMBARDS FOR INSTANCE
AND SEEMED DELIGHTED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS MEADOWS HIS WOODS AND HIS RABBIT WARRENS PORTHOS HAD ALL THE TASTE AND PRIDE OF A LANDED PROPRIETOR WHEN D'ARTAGNAN SAW HIS TWO COMPANIONS IN EARNEST CONVERSATION
USUALLY SO QUICK AND INTELLIGENT IN THEIR EXPRESSION WERE NOW HALF CLOSED AND SEEMED FASTENED AS IT WERE UPON A SMALL CORNER OF BLUE SKY THAT WAS VISIBLE BEHIND THE OPENING OF THE CHIMNEYS
WHICH HE WAS FAR FROM RECKONING UPON THE NOISE DISTURBED THE LADY SHE SEEMED TO FANCY SHE WAS BEING EITHER FOLLOWED OR PURSUED WHICH WAS INDEED THE CASE AND TURNED ROUND
THEY SET OFF HUMMING SONGS WILD ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE LISTENING
AT EACH OTHER WITHOUT VENTURING TO OPEN THEIR LIPS THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO PORTHOS WAS FOR THEY HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE
THE TWO BEARERS OF THE CORPSE HAD UNFASTENED THE STRAPS BY WHICH THEY CARRIED THE LITTER AND WERE LETTING THEIR BURDEN GLIDE GENTLY INTO THE OPEN GRAVE
MY SHOP IS SAVED EXCLAIMED PLANCHET YES AS THE CHEESE WAS WHISPERED THE FOREMAN WHAT CHEESE THE DUTCH CHEESE INSIDE WHICH A RAT HAD MADE HIS WAY AND WE FOUND ONLY THE RIND LEFT
FOR THERE IS ALWAYS THAT BUSTLING AND NOISY INN WHICH IS A VERY DISAGREEABLE NEIGHBOR I HAD FOUR WINDOWS HERE BUT I BRICKED UP TWO LET US GO ON SAID D'ARTAGNAN
NO NO ONE SEEMS TO BE FOLLOWING THE COFFIN YES SAID PORTHOS I SEE A MAN
AH INDEED SAID THE MUSKETEER CONTINUING HIS IMPERCEPTIBLE TONE OF IRONY
PORTHOS BOWED WITH A REVERENCE WHICH ANNE OF AUSTRIA WOULD HAVE APPROVED OF
BRISK AND LIVELY AS EVER HELD OUT HIS HAND TO PLANCHET'S AND D'ARTAGNAN REQUESTED PERMISSION TO EMBRACE MADAME TRUCHEN THE LATTER TO SHOW THAT SHE BORE NO ILL WILL APPROACHED PORTHOS UPON WHOM SHE CONFERRED THE SAME FAVOR
I SHOULD LIKE TO PASS YOU MONSIEUR IF IT IS NOT TROUBLING YOU TOO MUCH VERY WELL SAID PORTHOS IT DOES NOT TROUBLE ME IN THE LEAST AT THE SAME MOMENT HE TOOK HOLD OF THE YOUNG FELLOW BY THE WAISTBAND LIFTED HIM OFF THE GROUND AND PLACED HIM VERY GENTLY ON THE OTHER SIDE
NEAR THE TABLE IN A HIGH BACKED ARMCHAIR RECLINED FAST ASLEEP A WOMAN OF ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE HER FACE THE VERY PICTURE OF HEALTH AND FRESHNESS UPON HER KNEES LAY A LARGE CAT WITH HER PAWS FOLDED UNDER HER
AND A VERY PRETTY NAME TOO SAID PORTHOS
IT IS EXACTLY MY OWN CASE I WAS SO MELANCHOLY AT FIRST THAT I COULD DO NOTHING BUT MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS ALL DAY AND THE CHANTS WERE LIKE SO MANY NAILS BEING DRIVEN INTO MY HEAD BUT NOW THEY LULL ME TO SLEEP
THE CAVALIER KNEELS AT THE BEGINNING THE YOUNG LADY BY AND BY GETS TAMED DOWN AND THEN IT IS SHE WHO HAS TO SUPPLICATE WHO IS THIS LADY I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO ASCERTAIN THIS SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER FOR ARAMIS WAS THE FIRST TO LEAVE
BUT SIMPLY PLACED UPON A STOOL FORMED AN ANGLE OF THE MOST OBTUSE FORM THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE SEEN BOTH HIS ARMS WERE CROSSED OVER HIS HEAD HIS HEAD RECLINING UPON HIS LEFT SHOULDER LIKE ALEXANDER THE GREAT HIS EYES
THE MUSKETEER FELT THAT HE NEEDED SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS TO SATISFY THE CRAVINGS OF HIS NATURE AT EVERY MOMENT ASSAILED BY PEOPLE ASKING HIM HOW DO YOU THINK THIS COSTUME SUITS ME MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN HE WOULD REPLY TO THEM IN QUIET SARCASTIC TONES
IN THE BEAUTIFUL MEADOWS WHERE THE GRASS GREW AS HIGH AS THE KNEES AND WHERE HE HAD PLAYED UNDER THE GREEN APPLE TREES COVERED WITH RED CHEEKED FRUIT HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE HAD SOLEMNLY PROMISED HIMSELF THAT AS SOON AS HE SHOULD HAVE MADE HIS FORTUNE HE WOULD RETURN TO NATURE
OH THEY SHALL HAVE AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE GENTLY GENTLY MY MAN SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE ARE GETTING ON A LITTLE TOO FAST A FEW OATS AND A GOOD BED NOTHING MORE SOME BRAN AND WATER FOR MY HORSE SAID PORTHOS
BUT A FORTUNATE MOVEMENT OF THE HORSE MADE HIM MISS HIS AIM
TOOK BOTH HIS FRIENDS BY THE HAND I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU OVER THE HOUSE HE SAID
IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE NO LONGER YOUR ORDERS TO ISSUE OR YOUR MEN TO REVIEW AND MANEUVER YOU NEED THE SOUND OF GUNS DRUMS AND ALL THAT DIN AND CONFUSION
THE GRAVE HAVING BEEN FILLED UP THE PRIESTS TURNED AWAY AND THE GRAVE DIGGER HAVING ADDRESSED A FEW WORDS TO THEM FOLLOWED THEM AS THEY MOVED AWAY
THE CAVALIERS LOOKED UP AND SAW THAT WHAT PLANCHET HAD ANNOUNCED TO THEM WAS TRUE TEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS THEY WERE IN THE STREET CALLED THE RUE DE LYON ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HOSTELRY OF THE BEAU PAON A HIGH HEDGE OF BUSHY ELDERS
QUITE EXHAUSTED FROM DANCING YOU WISH TO LEAVE ME MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN INQUIRED THE KING WITH AN AIR OF ASTONISHMENT
PIERREFONDS I HAVE ONLY ONE COW PLANCHET HASTENED TO SAY MODESTLY AND I HAVE THIRTY SAID PORTHOS OR RATHER I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW HOW MANY I HAVE WHEN THE TWO CAVALIERS HAD ENTERED PLANCHET FASTENED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM
AFTER A PROLONGED REFLECTION ON THE SUBJECT THE MOST INGENIOUS MEANS THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WAS TO LET HIMSELF ROLL OFF THE SACK ON TO THE FLOOR MURMURING AT THE SAME TIME AGAINST HIMSELF THE WORD STUPID BUT
ON SECOND THOUGHTS HE TOOK HOLD OF HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND LED IT ABOUT THIRTY PACES FURTHER ON HIS TWO COMPANIONS FOLLOWING HIM HE THEN ADVANCED ABOUT ANOTHER THIRTY PACES UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF A CART HOUSE LIGHTED BY AN IRON GRATING AND LIFTING UP A WOODEN LATCH PUSHED OPEN ONE OF THE FOLDING DOORS
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A REPRESENTATION NOW FOR I THINK I HEARD SOMETHING LIKE CHANTING YES SAID D'ARTAGNAN I HEAR SINGING TOO
THE OFFICIATING PRIEST THE BEADLE
IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CAN WALK ABOUT THE KING'S FOREST WHICH IS VERY BEAUTIFUL
WOULD BE ONE OF THE PRIVILEGED TRAVELERS AND AS THE PLUME IN PORTHOS'S HAT MADE THE WOODEN CANDLES SUSPENDED OVER THE FRONT JINGLE TOGETHER
MONSIEUR SAID PLANCHET I AM ONE OF THOSE GOOD HUMORED SORT OF MEN WHOM HEAVEN CREATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF LIVING A CERTAIN SPAN OF DAYS
HE ENTERED FIRST LEADING HIS HORSE AFTER HIM BY THE BRIDLE INTO A SMALL COURTYARD WHERE AN ODOR MET THEM WHICH REVEALED THEIR CLOSE VICINITY TO A STABLE THAT SMELLS ALL RIGHT SAID PORTHOS LOUDLY GETTING OFF HIS HORSE AND I ALMOST BEGIN TO THINK
AND HIS EYES FIXED ON D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS EITHER THINKING DREAMING OR SLEEPING WITH HIS EYES OPEN
I HAVE HAD FOUR AVENUES LAID OUT AND AT THE END OF EACH IS A LANDSCAPE OF AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT CHARACTER FROM THE OTHERS
AND CAME OUT INTO A LITTLE GARDEN BEHIND THE HOUSE THE PRINCIPAL FRONT OF WHICH AS WE HAVE ALREADY NOTICED FACED THE STREET AS THEY APPROACHED
HE TOOK BY ASSAULT PORTHOS'S ROOM WHICH WAS NEXT TO HIS OWN THE WORTHY PORTHOS WAS SLEEPING WITH A NOISE LIKE DISTANT THUNDER IN THE DIM OBSCURITY OF THE ROOM HIS GIGANTIC FRAME WAS PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED
AND HER EYES HALF CLOSED PURRING IN THAT SIGNIFICANT MANNER WHICH ACCORDING TO FELINE HABITS INDICATES PERFECT CONTENTMENT
WHERE HIS FINGERS COULD ALWAYS FISH UP WHATEVER HIS NOSE DETECTED THE DELICIOUS FIGS FROM PROVENCE FILBERTS FROM THE FOREST TOURS PLUMS WERE SUBJECTS OF HIS UNINTERRUPTED ATTENTION FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE HOURS HIS TEETH LIKE MILLSTONES CRACKED HEAPS OF NUTS
RECOMMENDED A NEW DESCENT INTO THE CELLAR AND AS PLANCHET NO LONGER WALKED WITH THE STEADINESS OF A WELL TRAINED FOOT SOLDIER
YES BUT IF RAISINS NUTS AND ALMONDS ARE HEATING THERE IS NO DOUBT AT ALL OF IT MONSIEUR HONEY IS VERY COOLING SAID PORTHOS STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TOWARD A SMALL BARREL OF HONEY WHICH WAS OPEN AND HE PLUNGED THE SCOOP WITH
HOW SO WHY YOU SEEM TO BE IN THE WAY OF MAKING YOUR FORTUNE VERY SOON
BUT D'ARTAGNAN DID NOT STIR
DO NOT TROUBLE YOURSELVES HE SAID IF TRUCHEN SHOULD LEAVE THE TABLE NOW AND THEN DURING SUPPER FOR SHE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AFTER YOUR BEDROOMS IN FACT THE HOUSEKEEPER MADE HER ESCAPE QUITE FREQUENTLY AND THEY COULD HEAR ON THE FIRST FLOOR ABOVE THEM THE CREAKING OF THE WOODEN BEDSTEADS AND THE ROLLING OF THE CASTORS ON THE FLOOR
THE FOREMAN CLASPED HIS HANDS TOGETHER THE TWO OTHERS GOT UNDER THE COUNTERS FEARING PORTHOS MIGHT HAVE A TASTE FOR HUMAN FLESH WE SHALL ONLY TAKE A SORT OF SNACK HERE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
GREATNESS HAS IN GENERAL THIS MANIFEST ADVANTAGE THAT IT CAN LOWER ITSELF WHEN IT PLEASES AND HAS VERY NEAR THE CHOICE OF BOTH THE ONE AND THE OTHER CONDITION FOR A MAN DOES NOT FALL FROM ALL HEIGHTS
SUPERIORITY AND INFERIORITY DOMINION AND SUBJECTION ARE BOUND TO A NATURAL ENVY AND CONTEST AND MUST OF NECESSITY PERPETUALLY INTRENCH UPON ONE ANOTHER
THE OUTER GLARE THAT ENVIRONS HIM CONCEALS AND SHROUDS HIM FROM US OUR SIGHT IS THERE REPELLED AND DISSIPATED BEING FILLED AND STOPPED BY THIS PREVAILING LIGHT
BUT THE EARTHEN POT EXCUSED HIMSELF SAYING THAT IT WOULD BE WISER FOR HIM TO STAY IN THE CORNER BY THE FIRE IT WOULD TAKE SO LITTLE TO BREAK ME HE SAID YOU KNOW HOW FRAGILE I AM
WHO AS THEIR MASTER PRETENDED TO THE HONOUR OF A GOOD PHYSICIAN CAME TO HIM TO HAVE INCISIONS AND CAUTERIES MADE IN THEIR LIMBS FOR THESE OTHERS SUFFERED THE SOUL A MORE DELICATE AND NOBLE PART TO BE CAUTERISED
BUT TO END WHERE I BEGAN THE EMPEROR ADRIAN DISPUTING WITH THE PHILOSOPHER FAVORINUS ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF SOME WORD
I DISRELISH ALL DOMINION WHETHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE
THAT THE HEARTS OF OUR PEOPLE BE LIGHTENED OF THEIR BURDENS AND WHEN THE HERALD HAD FINISHED READING HE BLEW AGAIN UPON THE TRUMPET THREE TIMES AND THE VILLAGERS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN BEWILDERMENT
EVIL NEITHER IS PAIN ALWAYS TO BE SHUNNED NOR PLEASURE ALWAYS TO BE PURSUED THEIR GOOD QUALITIES ARE DEAD AND LOST
THAT HARD FISTS ARE LACKING THE FARMER AND HIS SONS A RICH OLD FARMER WHO FELT THAT HE HAD NOT MANY MORE DAYS TO LIVE
AND FRUITION OF GREATNESS FORASMUCH AS AMBITION NEVER COMPORTS ITSELF BETTER ACCORDING TO ITSELF THAN WHEN IT PROCEEDS BY OBSCURE AND UNFREQUENTED WAYS
WE HEREBY ISSUE PROCLAMATION THAT WHOSOEVER HATH A SORROW LET HIM OR HER BRING IT FORTH AND WE OUT OF OUR PRIVATE PURSE WILL PURCHASE THE SAID SORROW ACCORDING TO ITS VALUE
WAS A YOUNG MAN OF GREAT NOBILITY OF BEARING RICHLY BUT SOMBERLY DRESSED AND WITH A DARK BEAUTIFUL FACE FILLED WITH A PROUD MELANCHOLY HE KEPT HIS EYES ON THE FADING SUNSET
WHERE EVERY ONE IS ON THEIR SIDE METHINKS I SEE THOSE PALADINS OF ANCIENT TIMES PRESENTING THEMSELVES TO JOUSTS AND BATTLE
WHEN I THINK TO GROW GREATER TIS BUT VERY MODERATELY AND BY A COMPELLED AND TIMOROUS ADVANCEMENT SUCH AS IS PROPER FOR ME IN RESOLUTION IN PRUDENCE IN HEALTH IN BEAUTY
IN YOUR SEARCH THE FATHER DIED AND NO SOONER WAS HE IN HIS GRAVE THAN THE SONS SET TO WORK DIGGING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT TURNING UP EVERY FOOT OF GROUND WITH THEIR SPADES
WAS CLAD AFTER THE MANNER OF A STEWARD AND THE THREE HORSEMEN SAT MOTIONLESS AWAITING THE BEWILDERED AMBASSADORS OF BEETHORPE
AND STUMBLED AT AND OVERTURNED WHATEVER WAS UNDER FOOT
IN CONSIDERATION OF THE INTOLERABLE WEIGHT OF THEIR FUNCTION WHICH ASTOUNDS ME TIS HARD TO KEEP MEASURE IN SO IMMEASURABLE A POWER YET SO IT IS THAT IT IS
WHAT THEN IS TO BE EXPECTED FROM THEM THAT WOULD YET PUT INTO CONSIDERATION THE GLORY ATTENDING THIS REFUSAL WHEREIN THERE MAY LURK WORSE AMBITION THAN EVEN IN THE DESIRE ITSELF
AS HE THOUGHT FIT IN ANOTHER GREAT BAG THE STEWARD HAD COLLECTED THE SORROWS OF THE VILLAGE OF BEETHORPE AND BY THIS THE MOON WAS RISING AND WITH ANOTHER BLAST OF TRUMPET BY WAY OF FAREWELL
THE FARMER AND THE CRANES SOME CRANES SAW A FARMER PLOWING A LARGE FIELD WHEN THE WORK OF PLOWING WAS DONE THEY PATIENTLY WATCHED HIM SOW THE SEED
THE MOST PAINFUL AND DIFFICULT EMPLOYMENT IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION IS WORTHILY TO DISCHARGE THE OFFICE OF A KING I EXCUSE MORE OF THEIR MISTAKES THAN MEN COMMONLY DO
BUT IF MY HEART BE NOT GREAT ENOUGH TIS OPEN ENOUGH TO MAKE AMENDS AT ANY ONE'S REQUEST FREELY TO LAY OPEN ITS WEAKNESS
IF WE DISCOVER THAT THEY HAVE THE LEAST DESIRE TO GET THE BETTER OF US
THAT ALL THINGS MUST GIVE WAY TO HIM FORTUNE THEREIN SETS YOU TOO REMOTE FROM SOCIETY AND PLACES YOU IN TOO GREAT A SOLITUDE THIS EASINESS AND MEAN FACILITY OF MAKING ALL THINGS BOW UNDER YOU
YOU OVERWHELM HIM HE MUST BEG DISTURBANCE AND OPPOSITION AS AN ALMS HIS BEING AND HIS GOOD ARE IN INDIGENCE EVIL TO MAN IS IN ITS TURN GOOD AND GOOD
SHOULD ANY ONE PUT ME UPON COMPARING THE LIFE OF L THORIUS BALBUS A BRAVE MAN HANDSOME LEARNED HEALTHFUL UNDERSTANDING AND ABOUNDING IN ALL SORTS OF CONVENIENCES AND PLEASURES
TWO POTS ONE OF BRASS AND THE OTHER OF CLAY STOOD TOGETHER ON THE HEARTHSTONE ONE DAY THE BRASS POT PROPOSED TO THE EARTHEN POT THAT THEY GO OUT INTO THE WORLD TOGETHER
FOR THEY CAN ONLY BE PERCEIVED BY COMPARISON AND WE PUT THEM OUT OF THIS THEY HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUE PRAISE HAVING THEIR EARS DEAFENED WITH SO CONTINUAL AND UNIFORM AN APPROBATION
WHEN THESE HAD APPROACHED NEAR ENOUGH THE HERALD ONCE MORE SET THE TRUMPET TO HIS LIPS AND BLEW AND THEN UNFOLDING A PARCHMENT SCROLL READ IN A LOUD VOICE TO THE FOLK OF BEETHORPE
OF THE INCONVENIENCE OF GREATNESS SINCE WE CANNOT ATTAIN UNTO IT LET US REVENGE OUR SELVES BY RAILING AT IT AND YET
FAR AND WIDE HE HAD RIDDEN OVER HIS ESTATES SEEKING SO RARE A SORROW BUT AS YET HE HAD FOUND NO SORROW THAT COULD NOT BE BOUGHT WITH A LITTLE BAG OF GOLD AND SILVER COINS
TO BE TRANSPORTED WITH PASSIONS TO HONOUR THEM WITH THE VIRTUES THAT AMONGST US ARE BUILT UPON THESE IMPERFECTIONS WHO DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE HAZARD AND DIFFICULTY
AGAIN THE TRUMPET BLEW AND THEN THE BRAVER OF THE YOUNG MEN OF THE TOWN HASTENED UP THE HILL TO LEARN ITS MEANING AS THEY APPROACHED THE HORSEMEN THEY PERCEIVED THAT THE CENTER OF THE THREE
NOT ONLY BY APPROBATION BUT BY IMITATION ALSO EVERY ONE OF ALEXANDER'S FOLLOWERS CARRIED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AS HE DID AND THE FLATTERERS OF DIONYSIUS
THE EARTHEN POT COULD NOT SURVIVE THAT SORT OF COMPANIONSHIP VERY LONG THEY HAD NOT GONE TEN PACES BEFORE THE EARTHEN POT CRACKED AND AT THE NEXT JOLT
BUT THE SINCERITY OF HIS SORROW MADE HIM JEALOUS OF THE SANCTITY OF SORROW AND AT THE SAME TIME STERNLY CRITICAL OF AND SADLY AMUSED BY THE HYPOCRISIES OF SORROW
THAN THE TRIALS THAT WE MAKE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER OUT OF EMULATION OF HONOUR AND WORTH WHETHER IN THE EXERCISES OF THE BODY OR IN THOSE OF THE MIND WHEREIN SOVEREIGN GREATNESS CAN HAVE NO TRUE PART
HAS SEEN HIS COURTIERS REPUDIATE THEIRS WHOM THEY LOVED
HE EXPECTED TO SCARE THE CRANES JUST BY SWINGING THE SLING IN THE AIR AND SHOUTING LOUDLY AT THEM AT FIRST THE CRANES FLEW AWAY IN GREAT TERROR BUT THEY SOON BEGAN TO SEE THAT NONE OF THEM EVER GOT HURT
WAS THERE A SORROW IN THE WORLD THAT NO MONEY COULD BUY IT WAS TO FIND SUCH A SORROW THAT LORD MORTIMER THUS
BEETHORPE WAS AN ANCIENT TOWN MYSTERIOUSLY SOWN CENTURIES AGO LIKE A WANDERING THISTLE DOWN OF HUMAN LIFE AMID THE SILENCE AND THE NIBBLING SHEEP OF THE GREAT CHALK DOWNS
IT STOOD IN A HOLLOW OF THE LONG SMOOTH BILLOWS OF PALE PASTURE THAT SUAVELY MELTED INTO THE SKY ON EVERY SIDE THE EVENING WAS SO STILL
POLLIO AND I SAID POLLIO SAY NOTHING FOR IT IS NOT PRUDENCE TO WRITE IN CONTEST WITH HIM WHO HAS POWER TO PROSCRIBE AND THEY WERE RIGHT
AND AS FOR WORDS THEY WOULD KILL NOBODY AT LAST THEY PAID NO ATTENTION WHATEVER TO THE FARMER THE FARMER SAW THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE OTHER MEASURES
SO THE EARTHEN POT AT LAST CONSENTED AND THE TWO SET OUT SIDE BY SIDE JOLTING ALONG ON THREE STUBBY LEGS FIRST TO THIS SIDE THEN TO THAT AND BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER AT EVERY STEP
TWO SCOTTISH AUTHORS CONTENDING UPON THIS SUBJECT OF WHOM HE WHO STANDS FOR THE PEOPLE MAKES THE KING TO BE IN A WORSE CONDITION THAN A CARTER HE WHO WRITES FOR MONARCHY PLACES HIM SOME DEGREES ABOVE GOD IN POWER AND SOVEREIGNTY
CALLED HIS SONS TO HIS BEDSIDE MY SONS HE SAID HEED WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU DO NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PART WITH THE ESTATE THAT HAS BELONGED TO OUR FAMILY FOR SO MANY GENERATIONS
THERE CAME NEWS TO HIM THAT THERE WAS ONE REAL SORROW IN BEETHORPE AND HE RODE ALONE ON HORSEBACK TO THE VILLAGE AND FOUND A BEAUTIFUL GIRL LAYING FLOWERS ON A GRAVE SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
ITS ESSENCE IS NOT SO EVIDENTLY COMMODIOUS THAT A MAN MAY NOT WITH OUT A MIRACLE REFUSE IT I FIND IT A VERY HARD THING TO UNDERGO MISFORTUNES
SO AS HE SAT HIS HORSE AND GAZED AT THE SUNSET HE SMILED SADLY TO HIMSELF AS HE HEARD WITHOUT SEEMING TO HEAR THE SMALL INSINCERE SORROWS OF HIS VILLAGE OF BEETHORPE
IT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY RAILING AGAINST ANYTHING TO PROCLAIM ITS DEFECTS BECAUSE THEY ARE IN ALL THINGS TO BE FOUND HOW BEAUTIFUL OR HOW MUCH TO BE COVETED SOEVER
AND WHERE THE LEAST BENEFIT REDOUNDS TO SO MANY MEN AND WHERE YOUR TALENT OF ADMINISTRATION LIKE THAT OF PREACHERS PRINCIPALLY ADDRESSES ITSELF TO THE PEOPLE NO VERY EXACT JUDGE
BUT IF I WAS TO COMPARE THEM WITH MY OWN I SHOULD THEN ALSO SAY THAT THE FIRST IS AS MUCH ACCORDING TO MY CAPACITY AND FROM DESIRE WHICH I CONFORM TO MY CAPACITY AS THE SECOND IS FAR BEYOND IT
HAVE THEY TO DO WITH THE STUPIDEST OF ALL THEIR SUBJECTS THEY HAVE NO MEANS TO TAKE ANY ADVANTAGE OF HIM IF HE BUT SAY TIS BECAUSE HE IS MY KING
EVEN TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT OF THE BEST NATURE A SINGULAR INCITEMENT TO VIRTUE TO BE SEATED IN A PLACE WHERE YOU CANNOT DO THE LEAST GOOD THAT SHALL NOT BE PUT UPON RECORD
GOOD AS HE WAS MORRIS WAS FICKLE TASTED
I KNOW HIS LICENSE TO MARRY WOULD RUN OUT IN TIME BUT FOR ETERNITY OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW
JUST A PHOTOGRAPHER'S PHOTOGRAPH IF IT'S A PICTURE WITH A PAST WHY EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT PAST IS AND WILL RESPECT IT
SHE WHO ANSWERED CHUCKLING THAT'S WHAT I SAY ANYTHING FOR A CHANGE
AND SHE WAS NINETY ODD AN ASTHMATIC BUT HE'D COME HOME FROM THEM VISITS AN CALL ME HIS CHILD WIFE I'VE HAD MY HAPPY MOMENTS YOU KNOW A MAN'LL GET TIRED OF HIMSELF EVEN IF HE'S CONDEMNED
THE WIDOW MORRIS HAD SOUGHT SOLACE IN THIS HER ONLY CHERISHED RELIC AFTER THE HALF HOUR OF SKY WORKS WHICH HAD MADE HER IN HER OWN VERNACULAR A LONELY CONFLAGRATED WIDOW WITH A HEART FULL OF ASHES
GLANCE UP AT THAT HOTEL ANY TIME I WILL I CAN GENERALLY FIND HIM ON THE LOOKOUT
BUT LOOK SHE RAISED HER EYES EXCITEDLY TOWARD THE MANTEL LOOK WHAT'S THAT HE'S WAVIN IT LOOKS OH YES IT IS IT'S OUR WINGS TWO PAIRS
SHE SPOKE THROUGH A MOUTHFUL OF GILT HAIRPINS AND HER VOICE WAS AS AN A EOLIAN HARP AN HE BURNED IN IT AN SHE'S A WIDOW YET YES I DID HEAR THERE'D BEEN A FIRE
AN BORN DAUGHTER TO AN APOSTLE WHAT'S THE USE I'D SAY AN SO FIRST AN LAST I'D GET A SORT O
THEN I LOANED HER MY SMELLIN' SALTS WHICH SHE HELD HER BREATH AGAINST UNTIL IT GOT TO BE A CASE OF SMELL OR DIE AN SHE SMELT THEN IT WAS A CASE OF TEMPORARY SPASMS FOR A MINUTE
IT SEEMED TO HAVE SET IN FOR A LONG SPELL FOR WHEN SHE FINALLY FELL ASLEEP FROM SHEER DISAPPOINTMENT LONG TOWARDS MORNING IT WAS STILL RAINING BUT WHEN SHE AWOKE THE SUN SHONE
SHE HAD THOUGHT FOR ONE BRIEF MOMENT THAT HE WAS BECKONING TO HER AND THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE TO GO TO HIM AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO EXPERIENCE TERROR WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND OTHER PREMONITIONS OF SUDDEN PASSING
WAS IT ANY WONDER THAT HER FRIENDS EXCHANGED GLANCES WHILE MISSUS MORRIS ENTERTAINED THEM IN SO DROLL A WAY STILL AS TIME PASSED AND SHE NOT ONLY BRIGHTENED IN THE LIGHT OF HER DELUSION
AND AS SHE BEGAN TO BACK DOWN SHE DISCOVERED THE CAT UNDER HER ELBOW GLARING AT THE PICTURE
AN ME HIS OWN SELECTED AN DIDN'T I USE TO MAKE SOME EXCUSE TO SEND
AN GET THE BETTER OF THINGS
IT WAS A GOOD ADVERTISEMENT BUT I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE EMBARRASSIN TO HER SHE WAS GROWING WEAKER BUT SHE ROUSED HERSELF TO AMEND BETTER RAFFLE THE PICTURE
AT LARGE IN THE GREAT HOUSE FREE TO PASS AT WILL FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER TO HAVE HAD HIM FIXED NO MATTER HOW EFFECTIVELY WOULD HAVE BEEN A LIMITATION AS IT WAS SHE PRESSED THE PICTURE TO HER BOSOM
TO SUDDENLY LOSE THE PIVOT UPON WHICH HIS EMOTIONS ARE SWUNG AT ANY RATE MISSUS MORRIS CRIED SHE SAID THAT SHE CRIED ALL NIGHT FIRST BECAUSE IT SEEMED SO SPOOKY TO SEE HIM
PARTLY TO RECOMPENSE HER FOR HER DISCRETION IN LEAVING THAT HOTEL WHEN SHE DID AN PARTLY FOR UNDUE SUSPICION THERE'S A FEW DEBTS TO BE PAID BUT THERE'S EGGS AN THINGS THAT'LL PAY THEM
WILL SEEM THE MOST DEPRIVED TO LOSE IT SO THEY SAY THE BLONDE WAS A PERSON OF WORDS
AN EVEN IF HE'D BE TAKEN UP WITH HER HE'D GET
MYSELF ENOUGH TO BEQUEATH IT TO THE YOUNG LADY I SUSPICIONED BUT HUMAN NATURE IS FRAIL AN I CAN'T QUITE DO IT ALTHOUGH DOUBTLESS SHE WOULD LIKE IT AS A SOUVENIR
THE SALTS SPILLIN OUT OVER HER FACE BUT WHEN THE ACCIDENT EVAPORATED AN SHE OPENED HER EYES RATIONAL I THOUGHT TO MYSELF MAYBE SHE DON'T KNOW SHE'S KEELED AN WOULD BE HUMILIATED IF SHE DID
AS A SIMILITUDE TO THE KINGDOM O HEAVEN IN A HOTEL
DOWN AN THROUGH EVERY EGG IN THAT BASKET
AN THEN ANOTHER CHASED HIM AROUND FOR A STICK OF PEPPERMINT CANDY THINK OF ALL THAT INSIDE A CLOSE FENCE
THIS WAS A GREAT DISCOVERY AND NATURALLY ENOUGH IT SET HER WEEPING FOR SHE SOBBED IT MADE HER FEEL FOR A MINUTE THAT SHE HAD LOST HER WIDOWHOOD AND THAT AFTER THE SHOWER HE'D BE COMING HOME
WHEN THEM THREE WOULD LOOM UP
WELL BY THIS TIME A MAN WHO HAD SEEN HER
IN THE ROOM WITHOUT AWNINGS THIS BEING HER NEAREST APPROACH TO THE ALLEGED OCCUPANT'S BOSOM WHEN SHE WAS SUDDENLY STARTLED BY A PECULIAR SWISHING SOUND AS OF WIND BLOWN RAIN
FOR THERE IS EVEN DELIGHT IN TEARS IN SOME SITUATIONS IN LIFE ESPECIALLY IS THIS TRUE OF ONE WHOSE EMOTIONS ARE HER ONLY GUIDES
AFTER SEEING HIM DRAW THE WINDOW SASHES AND HE HAD DRAWN THEM DOWN IGNORING HER PRESENCE SHE SAT FOR HOURS WAITING FOR THE RAIN TO STOP
NOT EVEN AN AWNING FLAPPING WHILE THE EARTH ON HER PLANE WAS TORN BY STORMS ON ONE MEMORABLE OCCASION WHEN HER HUSBAND HAD APPEARED FLAPPING THE WINDOW PANES FROM WITHIN WITH A TOWEL
I NEVER INHERITED ANYTHING BUT INDIGESTION THE LAST SPEAKER WAS A MAIDEN LADY
WHEN WE'D BE ALONE AN NOBODY TO REMARK ABOUT ME BREAKIN MY MOURNIN DEAR ME HOW FULL O B'OYANCY
AT FIRST SHE EXPERIENCED A SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HER MAN WAS NOT VISIBLE AT DOOR OR WINDOW BUT IT WAS ONLY A PASSING REGRET IT WAS REALLY BETTER TO FEEL HIM SURELY AND BROADLY WITHIN
WINDOW TO ANOTHER DRAWING DOWN THE SASHES ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE REAL SHOWER WHOSE MUSIC WAS IN HER EARS
FLOPPED BREATHLESS AND WHITE
OVER SHE TOPPLED AGAIN NO PULSE NOR NOTHIN SAME AS THE DEAD WHILE THE BLONDE TALKED SHE BUSIED HERSELF WITH HER LOOSELY FALLING LOCKS WHICH SHE TRIED VAINLY TO ENTRAP
SUCH A TURN AS TOOK HER
AND AS SHE SLIPPED THE LADDER BACK INTO THE CLOSET SHE REMARKED THIS TO HERSELF STRICTLY IF IT HADN'T A BEEN FOR POOR PUSS I'D A HAD A HEAP MORE PLEASURE OUT O THIS PICTURE
AND SHE DECLARED HERSELF HAPPY INDEED A CERTAIN INEFFABLE LIGHT SUCH AS WE SOMETIMES SEE IN THE EYES OF THOSE NEWLY IN LOVE CAME TO SHINE FROM THE FACE OF THE WIDOW
THAT IS IF WE MAY BELIEVE THE FLURRIED TESTIMONY OF THE BLONDE WHO IN GOING OVER IT TWO HOURS LATER HAD MORE THAN ONCE TO STOP FOR BREATH
AS THE MONTHS PASSED MISSUS MORRIS
AND SHE SMILED AS SHE ADDED MARRIAGE THE EARTHLY WAY IS VICISSITUDINOUS FOR EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT ANYTHING IS LIABLE TO HAPPEN TO A MAN AT LARGE
WHEN I SCRAMBLED OVER THE COUNTER BREAKIN MY STRAIGHT FRONT IN TWO
MINE A LITTLE SMALLER I S'POSE IT'LL BE THE SAME OLD STORY I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO KEEP UP TO KEEP UP WITH HIM
THAT CAMPBELLITE PREACHER THET WAS BURNED IN WITH THEM AN WITH THAT MY IMAGINATION RUN RIOT AN I'D THINK TO MYSELF IF THEY'RE INCLINED THEY CERT'N'Y HAVE THINGS HANDY THEN I'D KETCH MYSELF AN SAY
WHOSE REMAINS SHE HAD SO RECENTLY BURIED ON FAITH WAIVING RECOGNITION IN THE DEBRIS
A SWEDENBORGIAN AND A GATES AJAR THAT OF COURSE ENGRAFTED ON TO A METHODIST NOW THAT HOTEL WHEN IT WAS CONSUMED BY FIRE WHICH TO IT WAS THE SAME AS MORTAL DEATH WHY
CONSIDERABLE JEWELRY HIS FIRST'S TASTE RUN THAT WAY AN THEY AIN'T NO CHILDREN YES THIS AMETHYST IS THE WEDDIN' RING
SO I ACTED CALLOUS AN I SAYS OFFHAND LIKE I SAYS PUSHIN HER APRON AROUND BEHIND HER OVER ITS VICE VERSA
WHO DID NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM LOOKING INTO SPACE AS SHE SAID IT TAKIN ALL THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION
FOR A DOLLAR A CHANCE AN LET THE PROCEEDS GO TO MY FUNERAL AN I WANT TO BE BURIED IN THE HOTEL FIRE GENERAL GRAVE
PROVIDENTIAL SUPPLY DEPARTMENT WHICH IN A MANNER HANGS TO HIS BELT
AN SOMETIMES
WOULD YOU THINK THEY'D HAVE THE GALL TO TRY TO GET ME TO COOK FOR EM THEY'VE ORDERED ANGEL CA AN WITH THAT
AND STAGGERED OUT TO A SEAT UNDER THE MULBERRIES AS SHE STAMMERED I DO DECLARE MORRIS'LL BE THE DEATH OF ME YET
HE'S MOST AS MUCH CARE TO ME DEAD AS HE WAS ALIVE I MADE SURE MADE SURE HE'D COME AFTER ME THEN FEELING HER OWN FIDELITY CHALLENGED SHE HASTENED TO ADD NOT THAT I HADN'T RATHER
MAYBE SHE'D FIND IT A LITTLE TOO SOUVENIRISH TO SUIT MY WIFELY TASTE AND YET
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE OUT THAT THE FIRST THING I INTEND TO DO WHEN I'M RELIEVED IS TO CALL BY THERE FOR MORRIS
GREW VERY WHITE AND STILL FIRE IS WHITE IN ITS ULTIMATE INTENSITY THE TOP SPINNING ITS FASTEST IS SAID TO SLEEP
BUT PROCEEDED TO MEET THE CONDITIONS OF HER OWN LIFE BY OPENING A SMALL SHOP IN HER HOME AND WHEN SHE EXHIBITED A WHOLESOME SENSE OF PROFIT AND LOSS
THERE HAD BEEN A TIME WHEN SHE LAMENTED THAT HER PICTURE WAS NOT LIFE SIZED AS IT WOULD SEEM SO MUCH MORE NATURAL BUT SHE IMMEDIATELY REFLECTED THAT THAT HOTEL
WOULD NOT SPARE A BONE OF HER MEAGER COMFORT
FOR MORRIS AND I WANT IT UNDERSTOOD THAT IT'LL BE A VACANT HOUSE FROM THE MINUTE I DEPART SO IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WOMAN THAT'S CALCULATIN TO HAVE ANY CARRYIN'S ON FROM THEM WINDOWS
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST VICTIMS AND FELL FROM THE BOUGH IN COMPANY WITH A SAD SHOWER OF LAST YEAR'S LEAVES THE WORTHY CRICKET FAMILY HOWEVER AVOIDED JACK FROST BY EMIGRATING IN TIME TO THE CHIMNEY CORNER OF A NICE LITTLE COTTAGE THAT HAD BEEN BUILT IN THE WOOD THAT SUMMER
HALF A DEWDROP AND A LITTLE BIT OF THE NICEST PART OF A ROSE LEAF I ASSURE YOU OFTEN LAST ME FOR A DAY BUT WE ARE FORGETTING OUR LIST LET'S SEE THE FIREFLIES BUTTERFLIES MOTHS THE BEES MUST COME I SUPPOSE
WHEN NANCY MARRIED TOM HE WAS WORKIN IN A CARPENTER SHOP IT WASN'T TOM'S FAULT HE COULDN'T MAKE A LIVIN BY HIS TRADE THAR WAS SCA'CELY ANY MONEY IN THAT KENTRY
AND I'D GOT TO LEG IT FOR DEAR LIFE WHEN I GITS NEAR ENOUGH TO THE HOUSE I HEARS MOTHER AND MORD HOLLERIN TO MAKE ME RUN FASTER AND GO TO THE DOOR FOR MOTHER HAD IT OPEN JIST WIDE ENOUGH TO REACH OUT AN SNATCH ME IN
THERE WAS SO LITTLE CARPENTERING OR CABINET MAKING TO DO THAT HE COULD MAKE A BETTER LIVING BY FARMING OR HUNTING THOMAS WAS VERY FOND OF SHOOTING AND AS HE WAS A FINE MARKSMAN HE COULD PROVIDE GAME FOR THE TABLE AND OTHER THINGS WHICH ARE CONSIDERED LUXURIES TO DAY
WELL NOW HE LOOKED JUST LIKE ANY OTHER BABY AT FUST LIKE RED CHERRY PULP SQUEEZED DRY AN HE DIDN'T IMPROVE NONE AS HE GROWED OLDER ABE NEVER WAS MUCH FUR LOOKS
IT WAS HARDLY WORTH WHILE TO ASK HER PRAY SHALL YOU INVITE THE CRICKETS SAID COLONEL KATY DID WHO I
ANNOUNCED TO HIS HEARERS THAT HE SHOULD CERTAINLY WRITE A DISCOURSE AGAINST DANCING FOR THE NEXT WEEKLY OCCASION THE GOOD DOCTOR WAS EVEN WITH HIS WORD IN THE MATTER AND GAVE OUT SOME VERY SONOROUS DISCOURSES
MORD LINCOLN INDIAN FIGHTER THAT WAS THE BREAKING UP OF OUR FAMILY NONE OF US BOYS WAS OLD ENOUGH TO TAKE FATHER'S PLACE AN MOTHER SHE WAS AFRAID TO LIVE THERE ALONE ACCORDIN TO THE LAWS O VIRGINIA
WELL YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS A QUAKER YOU SEE AND BELIEVED IN TREATIN THEM RED DEVILS WELL LIKE WILLIAM PENN DONE YOU KNOW HE WAS A MAN FOR PEACE AND QUIET AND EVERYTHING WAS GOIN SMOOTH WITH THE TRIBES OF WHAT WE CALLED THE BEARGRASS COUNTRY
I'M SURE SAID MISS KATY
NANCY'S GOT A BOY BABY MOTHER GOT FLUSTERED AN HURRIED UP ER WORK TO GO OVER TO LOOK AFTER THE LITTLE FELLER BUT I DIDN'T HAVE NOTHIN TO WAIT FUR SO I CUT AN RUN THE HULL TWO MILE TO SEE MY NEW COUSIN
THEN I HEARD THE CRACK OF A RIFLE AND I SAW A PUFF OF SMOKE FLOATIN OUT O THE BUSHES INJUNS GASPS MORD AND STARTS ON THE RUN FOR THE HOUSE TO GET HIS GUN JOSIAH HE STARTS RIGHT OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THE BEARGRASS FORT
LIKE THEY WUZ GOOD AN BAD WHITE MEN HE SAID I MIGHT JIST AS WELL SAY GOOD DEVIL AS GOOD INJUN HE SAYS THE ONLY GOOD INJUN'S THE DEAD INJUN WELL THE SETTLERS MUST A GREED WITH MORD
NOT A VILLAGE OR HARDLY A HAMLET CALLED ELIZABETHTOWN HE EVIDENTLY THOUGHT THIS PLACE WOULD BE LESS LONESOME FOR HIS WIFE WHILE HE WAS AWAY HUNTING AND CARPENTERING THAN THE LONELY FARM HE HAD PURCHASED IN HARDIN COUNTY ABOUT FOURTEEN MILES AWAY
FROM THIS SPRING THE PLACE CAME TO BE KNOWN AS ROCK SPRING FARM IT WAS A BARREN SPOT AND THE CABIN ON IT WAS A RUDE AND PRIMITIVE SORT OF HOME FOR A CARPENTER AND JOINER TO OCCUPY IT CONTAINED BUT A SINGLE ROOM
MORDECAI LINCOLN WAS A JOKER AND HUMORIST ONE WHO KNEW HIM WELL SAID OF HIM HE WAS A MAN OF GREAT DROLLERY AND IT WOULD ALMOST MAKE YOU LAUGH TO LOOK AT HIM I NEVER SAW BUT ONE OTHER MAN WHOSE QUIET DROLL LOOK EXCITED IN ME THE DISPOSITION TO LAUGH
AND THE CABIN WAS RECONSTRUCTED AND EXHIBITED THERE AND ELSEWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES THE MATERIALS WERE TAKEN BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL SITE AND A FINE MARBLE STRUCTURE NOW ENCLOSES THE PRECIOUS RELICS OF THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE FIRST AMERICAN
AN MORD FETCHES HIM DOWN LIKE HE DID THE FELLOW THAT WAS GOIN TO SKELP FATHER THAT MADE THE OTHERS MAD AN THEY TOOK AFTER ME BUT MORD HE DROPS THE HEAD ONE JIST WHEN HE'S GOIN TO HIT ME BUT ALL I KNOWED AT THE TIME WAS THAT THEM RED DEVILS WAS A CHASIN ME
A FEW YEARS YOUNGER WAS OUT IN THE CLEARIN WITH THE OXEN HAULIN LOGS DOWN TO THE CRICK I WENT ALONG TOO BUT I DIDN'T HELP MUCH FOR I WAS ONLY SIX YOUNG AS I WAS I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY LIKE IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY
NOT AT ALL PLEASED TO HEAR HIM PRAISED DON'T YOU I DON'T KNOW BUT HE IS A LITTLE STOUT SAID MISS KATY BUT SO DISTINGUISHED AND ELEGANT IN HIS MANNERS SOMETHING QUITE MARTIAL AND BREEZY ABOUT HIM
WHO CAME IN WITH HER WORK BAG ON HER ARM TO ASK A SUBSCRIPTION FOR A POOR FAMILY OF ANTS WHO HAD JUST HAD THEIR HOUSE HOED UP IN CLEARING THE GARDEN WALKS HOW STUPID OF THEM SAID KATY
SO COMMON THAT YOU COULD BUY THEM AT TWO BITS A BUSHEL MAPLE SUGAR SWUNG ON A STRING TO BITE OFF FOR COFFEE SYRUP IN BIG GOURDS PEACH AND HONEY A SHEEP THAT THE TWO FAMILIES BARBECUED WHOLE OVER COALS OF WOOD BURNED IN A PIT
FOR HE MOVED WITH HIS YOUNG WIFE AND HIS BABY GIRL TO A FARM ON NOLEN CREEK FOURTEEN MILES AWAY THE CHIEF ATTRACTION OF THE SO CALLED FARM WAS A FINE SPRING OF WATER BUBBLING UP IN THE SHADE OF A SMALL GROVE
BUT HE COULD ONLY PROTECT THE FRONT AND WAS A SETTIN FIRE TO OUR CABIN TO SMOKE US OUT OR ROAST US ALIVE JIST WHEN THE SOLDIERS COME WITH JOSIAH FROM THE FORT AND SAVED OUR LIVES THEN THE INJUNS MADE EMSELVES SCURCE BUT THEY DRUV OFF THE OXEN AND ALL OUR OTHER STOCK
CHOPPIN TREES AN GRUBBIN ROOTS AN SPLITTIN RAILS AN HUNTIN AN TRAPPIN DIDN'T LEAVE TOM NO TIME IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO TO GIT HIS FAMBLY ENOUGH TO EAT AND TO KIVER EM
EMIGRATED FROM ROCKINGHAM COUNTY VIRGINIA TO KENTUCKY ABOUT SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE OR TWO WHERE A YEAR OR TWO LATER HE WAS KILLED BY INDIANS NOT IN BATTLE BUT BY STEALTH WHEN HE WAS LABORING TO OPEN A FARM IN THE FOREST
I RICOLLECT HOW TOM JOKED ABOUT ABE'S LONG LEGS WHEN HE WAS TODDLIN ROUND THE CABIN HE GROWED OUT O HIS CLOTHES FASTER'N NANCY COULD MAKE EM BUT HE WAS MIGHTY GOOD COMP'NY SOLEMN AS A PAPOOSE BUT INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING
AND HER OLD FATHER PLAYS THE VIOLIN BEAUTIFULLY BY THE WAY WE MIGHT ENGAGE HIM FOR OUR ORCHESTRA AND SO MISS KATY'S BALL CAME OFF AND THE PERFORMERS KEPT IT UP FROM SUNDOWN TILL DAYBREAK SO THAT IT SEEMED AS IF EVERY LEAF IN THE FOREST WERE ALIVE
TOM HAD THE BEST SET OF TOOLS IN WHAT WAS THEN AND IS NOW WASHINGTON COUNTY JESSE HEAD THE GOOD METHODIST MINISTER THAT MARRIED THEM WAS ALSO A CARPENTER OR CABINET MAKER BY TRADE AND AS HE WAS THEN A NEIGHBOR THEY WERE GOOD FRIENDS
AN HE ALWAYS DID HAVE FITS O CUTTIN UP I'VE SEEN HIM WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE FELLER SETTIN ON A STOOL STARIN AT A VISITOR
AND SMALL DEEP SET GRAY EYES SHE HAD A FULL FOREHEAD A SHARP ANGULAR FACE AND A SAD EXPRESSION YET HER DISPOSITION WAS GENERALLY CHEERFUL FOR HER BACKWOODS ADVANTAGES SHE WAS CONSIDERED WELL EDUCATED
AS YOU HAVE SEEN SUSAN CLEAR AWAY THE COBWEBS IN YOUR MAMMA'S PARLOUR AND SO NOW THERE WERE ONLY LEFT A THOUSAND BLINKING BURNING WATER DROPS HANGING LIKE CONVEX MIRRORS AT THE END OF EACH LEAF AND MISS KATY ADMIRED HERSELF IN EACH ONE
THE BEES ARE A WORTHY FAMILY SAID THE COLONEL WORTHY ENOUGH BUT DREADFULLY HUMDRUM SAID MISS KATY THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT ANYTHING BUT HONEY AND HOUSEKEEPING STILL THEY ARE A CLASS OF PEOPLE ONE CANNOT NEGLECT
THE HANKSES WAS SOME SMARTER'N THE LINCOLNS TOM THOUGHT A HEAP O NANCY AN HE WAS AS GOOD TO HER AS HE KNOWED HOW
AN PEEKIN OUT THROUGH A CRACK HE SEES THAT INJUN TAKIN HOLD O ME WAITIN TILL THE OL DEMON TURNS AWAY SO'S NOT TO HIT ME MORD HE AIMS AT A SILVER DANGLER ON MISTER INJUN'S BREAST AND MAKES HIM DROP IN HIS TRACKS LIKE I SAID
WHEN THE THIRD INJUN WAS STOOPIN TO GRAB ME BUT MORD MAKES HIM BITE THE DUST LIKE THE OTHERS MY BUT WASN'T THEM INJUNS MAD SOME OF EM SNEAKED AROUND BEHIND THE HOUSE THEY HAD TO GIVE MORD'S GUN A WIDE BERTH TO GIT THERE
DON'T YOU SEE OH SAID THE COLONEL THAT'S IT IS IT EXCUSE ME BUT I HAVE BEEN LIVING IN FRANCE WHERE THESE DISTINCTIONS ARE WHOLLY UNKNOWN AND I HAVE NOT YET GOT MYSELF IN THE TRAIN OF FASHIONABLE IDEAS HERE
LITTLE IS KNOWN TODAY OF MORDECAI LINCOLN AND THERE WOULD BE LESS INTEREST IN POOR THOMAS IF HE HAD NOT BECOME THE FATHER OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN THE SIXTEENTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
ARISTOCRATIC DISTINCTION BUT THEN WE ARE LIBERAL WE ASSOCIATE WITH THE MOTHS WHO ARE GRAY WITH THE BUTTERFLIES WHO ARE BLUE AND GOLD COLOURED WITH THE GRASSHOPPERS YELLOW AND BROWN AND SOCIETY WOULD BECOME DREADFULLY MIXED
AS LOWELL CALLS LINCOLN IN HIS GREAT COMMEMORATION ODE COUSIN DENNIS HANKS GIVES THE FOLLOWING QUAINT DESCRIPTION OF NANCY'S BOY BABY AS REPORTED BY MISSUS ELEANOR ATKINSON IN HER LITTLE BOOK ON LINCOLN'S BOYHOOD
IT AFFECTS MY NERVES TERRIBLY WELL I'M SURE I HAVEN'T ANYTHING TO GIVE MAMMA SAID YESTERDAY SHE WAS SURE SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW OUR BILLS WERE TO BE PAID AND THERE'S MY GREEN SATIN WITH POINT LACE YET TO COME HOME
JUST AT THIS MOMENT THE CONFERENCE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A VISITOR MISS KEZIAH CRICKET
IF YOU ASK MY CANDID OPINION AS A FRIEND I SHOULD SAY NOT THERE'S YOUNG MOSQUITO WHO GRADUATED LAST YEAR HAS GONE INTO LITERATURE AND IS CONNECTED WITH SOME OF OUR LEADING PAPERS AND THEY SAY HE CARRIES THE SHARPEST PEN OF ALL THE WRITERS
LITTLE MISS CRICKET PERCEIVED HOW THE CASE STOOD AND SO HOPPED BRISKLY OFF WITHOUT GIVING HERSELF EVEN TIME TO BE OFFENDED
BUT WHEN MORD KILLED ONE O THEIR BUCKS THAT MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE I HAD SENSE ENOUGH LEFT TO RUN FOR THE HOUSE WITH THEM INJUNS AFTER ME SEEMED LIKE I COULDN'T RUN HALF AS FAST AS USUAL BUT I MUST A MADE PURTY GOOD TIME FROM WHAT MORD AN MOTHER SAID AFTERWARD
GRANDFATHER LINCOLN HAD BUILT A SOLID LOG CABIN AND CLEARED A FIELD OR TWO AROUND IT NEAR THE FALLS OF THE OHIO ABOUT WHERE LOUISVILLE NOW STANDS BUT IN THE SUMMER OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE TRAGIC DAY DAWNED UPON THE LINCOLNS
AN WAS TURNIN BACK TO SKELP FATHER WHEN BIFF ANOTHER GUN CRACK AND MISTER BIG INDIAN HE DROPS JIST LIKE YOUR GRANDFATHER DID ONLY HE WRIGGLES AND SQUIRMS AROUND BITIN THE DUST LIKE A BIG SNAKE FOR ALL THE WORLD
AND YOU MUST HELP ME TO MAKE OUT THE LISTS MY DEAR YOU MAKE ME THE HAPPIEST OF KATY DIDS NOW SAID MISS KATY DID DRAWING AN AZALEA LEAF TOWARDS HER LET US SEE WHOM SHALL WE HAVE THE FIREFLIES OF COURSE
CERTAINLY THE LOCUSTS OF COURSE A VERY OLD AND DISTINGUISHED FAMILY AND THE GRASSHOPPERS ARE PRETTY WELL AND OUGHT TO BE ASKED
WHEN HE GOT THE CHANCET THEY ALL LOOKED ON REDSKINS LIKE THEY WAS CATAMOUNTS AN OTHER PESKY VARMINTS YOUR GRANDMOTHER LINCOLN AN JOSIAH AN ME MOVED OVER INTO WASHINGTON COUNTY
SUCH AS FURS AND SKINS NEEDED FOR THE PRIMITIVE WEARING APPAREL OF THE PIONEERS A DAUGHTER WAS BORN TO THE YOUNG COUPLE AT ELIZABETHTOWN WHOM THEY NAMED SARAH DENNIS HANKS A COUSIN OF NANCY
YOU BET I WAS TICKLED TO DEATH BABIES WASN'T AS COMMON AS BLACKBERRIES IN THE WOODS O KAINTUCKY MOTHER COME OVER AN WASHED HIM AN PUT A YALLER FLANNEL PETTICOAT ON HIM AN COOKED SOME DRIED BERRIES WITH WILD HONEY FUR NANCY
AN A SPINDLIN FELLER HAD TO STAY IN THE SETTLEMINTS THE CLEARIN'S HADN'T NO USE FUR HIM TOM WAS STRONG
WHILE YOU PIN ME DOWN TO FACTS I WILL SAY THAT I SAW NANCY HANKS LINCOLN AT HER WEDDING A FRESH LOOKING GIRL I SHOULD SAY OVER TWENTY TOM WAS A RESPECTABLE MECHANIC AND COULD CHOOSE AND SHE WAS TREATED WITH RESPECT
BECAUSE THAT IS CLEARLY A THING THAT NONE HAS ANY HAND IN BUT OUR MAKER YOU SEE YES
THE FIRST BORN OF CREATURES IS THE PERFECT IMAGE OF GOD REFLECTING PERFECTLY THAT OF WHICH HE IS THE IMAGE AND SO HE IS SAID TO BE THE IMAGE AND NEVER TO THE IMAGE
NEVERTHELESS WE SAY THAT THE CROWDS WERE FED WITH FIVE LOAVES OR THAT WOMAN WAS MADE FROM THE RIB BECAUSE AN ADDITION WAS MADE TO THE ALREADY EXISTING MATTER OF THE LOAVES AND OF THE RIB
SHE WAS TAKEN OUT OF MAN WHEREFORE A MAN SHALL LEAVE FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE THIS WAS MOST NECESSARY AS REGARDS THE HUMAN RACE IN WHICH THE MALE AND FEMALE LIVE TOGETHER FOR LIFE
THESE REASONS REFER TO THE IMAGE CONSISTING IN THE CONFORMITY OF GRACE AND GLORY FIFTH ARTICLE
I ANSWER THAT WE MAY SPEAK OF GOD'S IMAGE IN TWO WAYS FIRST WE MAY CONSIDER IN IT THAT IN WHICH THE IMAGE CHIEFLY CONSISTS THAT IS THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE
AS FIRE IS SAID TO BE SPECIFICALLY THE MOST SUBTLE OF BODIES WHILE NEVERTHELESS ONE KIND OF FIRE IS MORE SUBTLE THAN ANOTHER SO WE SAY THAT NOTHING IS MORE LIKE TO GOD THAN THE HUMAN SOUL IN ITS GENERIC AND INTELLECTUAL NATURE
ACTS SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX SECONDLY THAT MAN MIGHT LOVE WOMAN ALL THE MORE AND CLEAVE TO HER MORE CLOSELY KNOWING HER TO BE FASHIONED FROM HIMSELF HENCE IT IS WRITTEN
BUT GOD IS THE CAUSE NOT ONLY OF RATIONAL BUT ALSO OF IRRATIONAL CREATURES THEREFORE THE IMAGE OF GOD IS TO BE FOUND IN IRRATIONAL CREATURES
WHETHER THE IMAGE OF GOD IS TO BE FOUND IN IRRATIONAL CREATURES OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE IMAGE OF GOD IS TO BE FOUND IN IRRATIONAL CREATURES FOR DIONYSIUS SAYS
SECONDLY BECAUSE THEY LIVE AND THIRDLY BECAUSE THEY KNOW OR UNDERSTAND AND THESE LAST AS AUGUSTINE SAYS
WHEREFORE FROM ANY OTHER MATTER AN INDIVIDUAL OF THE HUMAN SPECIES CANNOT NATURALLY BE GENERATED NOW GOD ALONE THE AUTHOR OF NATURE CAN PRODUCE AN EFFECT INTO EXISTENCE OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF NATURE
SAYS THAT CORPOREAL THINGS ARE GOVERNED BY GOD THROUGH THE ANGELS BUT THE WOMAN'S BODY WAS FORMED FROM CORPOREAL MATTER THEREFORE IT WAS MADE THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF THE ANGELS AND NOT IMMEDIATELY BY GOD
FOR SUCH AN INCREASE OF MATTER WOULD EITHER BE BY A CHANGE OF THE VERY SUBSTANCE OF THE MATTER ITSELF OR BY A CHANGE OF ITS DIMENSIONS NOT BY CHANGE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE MATTER
FURTHER SUBJECTION AND LIMITATION WERE A RESULT OF SIN
SUCH AS SOME PLANTS AND ANIMALS BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES FROM SOME FITTING MATTER AND NOT FROM SEED OTHERS POSSESS THE ACTIVE AND PASSIVE GENERATIVE POWER TOGETHER AS WE SEE IN PLANTS WHICH ARE GENERATED FROM SEED
THREE WHETHER OF MAN'S RIB FOUR WHETHER THE WOMAN WAS MADE IMMEDIATELY BY GOD FIRST ARTICLE
DIONYSIUS COMPARES THE SOLAR RAY TO DIVINE GOODNESS AS REGARDS ITS CAUSALITY NOT AS REGARDS ITS NATURAL DIGNITY WHICH IS INVOLVED IN THE IDEA OF AN IMAGE
BECAUSE AS AUGUSTINE HAD SAID PREVIOUSLY THINGS WHICH HAVE KNOWLEDGE ARE SO NEAR TO HIM IN LIKENESS THAT OF ALL CREATURES NONE ARE NEARER WHEREFORE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE ANGELS ARE NOT MORE TO GOD'S IMAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND AS REGARDS HUMAN NATURE IN GENERAL WOMAN IS NOT MISBEGOTTEN BUT IS INCLUDED IN NATURE'S INTENTION AS DIRECTED TO THE WORK OF GENERATION
AND SCRIPTURE IMPLIES THE SAME WHEN IT SAYS THAT MAN WAS MADE TO GOD'S LIKENESS FOR THE PREPOSITION TO SIGNIFIES A CERTAIN APPROACH AS OF SOMETHING AT A DISTANCE
SUBJECTION IS TWOFOLD ONE IS SERVILE BY VIRTUE OF WHICH A SUPERIOR MAKES USE OF A SUBJECT FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT AND THIS KIND OF SUBJECTION BEGAN AFTER SIN THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF SUBJECTION WHICH IS CALLED ECONOMIC OR CIVIL
FURTHER BOETHIUS
THUS IT IS CLEAR HOW TO SOLVE THE FIRST TWO OBJECTIONS
SAYS OF GOD HOLDING THE WORLD IN HIS MIND AND FORMING IT INTO HIS IMAGE THEREFORE THE WHOLE WORLD IS TO THE IMAGE OF GOD AND NOT ONLY THE RATIONAL CREATURE ON THE CONTRARY AUGUSTINE SAYS
FURTHER THE MORE PERFECT ANYTHING IS IN GOODNESS THE MORE IT IS LIKE GOD BUT THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS MORE PERFECT IN GOODNESS THAN MAN FOR THOUGH EACH INDIVIDUAL THING IS GOOD ALL THINGS TOGETHER ARE CALLED VERY GOOD
FURTHER AN IMAGE LEADS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT OF WHICH IT IS THE IMAGE THEREFORE IF THERE IS IN MAN THE IMAGE OF GOD AS TO THE TRINITY OF PERSONS SINCE MAN CAN KNOW HIMSELF BY HIS NATURAL REASON
HE IS THE MOST PERFECTLY LIKE GOD ACCORDING TO THAT IN WHICH HE CAN BEST IMITATE GOD IN HIS INTELLECTUAL NATURE NOW THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE IMITATES GOD CHIEFLY IN THIS THAT GOD UNDERSTANDS AND LOVES HIMSELF
FOUR WHETHER THE IMAGE OF GOD IS IN EVERY MAN FIVE WHETHER THE IMAGE OF GOD IS IN MAN BY COMPARISON WITH THE ESSENCE OR WITH ALL THE DIVINE PERSONS OR WITH ONE OF THEM
SOME HAVE SAID THAT IN MAN THERE IS AN IMAGE OF THE SON ONLY AUGUSTINE REJECTS THIS OPINION
THAT THE FEMALE IS A MISBEGOTTEN MALE BUT NOTHING MISBEGOTTEN OR DEFECTIVE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRST PRODUCTION OF THINGS THEREFORE WOMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE AT THAT FIRST PRODUCTION
SO THAT THE FEMALE SHOULD BE PRODUCED SEPARATELY FROM THE MALE ALTHOUGH THEY ARE CARNALLY UNITED FOR GENERATION THEREFORE DIRECTLY AFTER THE FORMATION OF WOMAN IT WAS SAID AND THEY SHALL BE TWO IN ONE FLESH
FIRST BECAUSE AS THE SON IS LIKE TO THE FATHER BY A LIKENESS OF ESSENCE IT WOULD FOLLOW OF NECESSITY IF MAN WERE MADE IN LIKENESS TO THE SON THAT HE IS MADE TO THE LIKENESS OF THE FATHER SECONDLY
WHETHER WOMAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE FROM MAN OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT WOMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE FROM MAN FOR SEX BELONGS BOTH TO MAN AND ANIMALS
LEST IT SHOULD BE THOUGHT THAT BOTH SEXES WERE UNITED IN ONE INDIVIDUAL BUT IN A SECONDARY SENSE THE IMAGE OF GOD IS FOUND IN MAN AND NOT IN WOMAN FOR MAN IS THE BEGINNING AND END OF WOMAN
WHEREFORE FROM DETERMINATE MATTER IT PRODUCES SOMETHING IN A DETERMINATE SPECIES ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIVINE POWER BEING INFINITE CAN PRODUCE THINGS OF THE SAME SPECIES OUT OF ANY MATTER SUCH AS A MAN FROM THE SLIME OF THE EARTH AND A WOMAN FROM OUT OF MAN
SO DIONYSIUS SAYS THAT EFFECTS ARE CONTINGENT IMAGES OF THEIR CAUSES THAT IS AS MUCH AS THEY HAPPEN CONTINGIT TO BE SO BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY
THE HUMAN MALE AND FEMALE ARE UNITED NOT ONLY FOR GENERATION AS WITH OTHER ANIMALS BUT ALSO FOR THE PURPOSE OF DOMESTIC LIFE IN WHICH EACH HAS HIS OR HER PARTICULAR DUTY AND IN WHICH THE MAN IS THE HEAD OF THE WOMAN
WHETHER THE WOMAN WAS FITTINGLY MADE FROM THE RIB OF MAN OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FORMED FROM THE RIB OF MAN FOR THE RIB WAS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE WOMAN'S BODY
NAMELY THAT IT IS COPIED FROM SOMETHING ELSE FOR AN IMAGE IS SO CALLED BECAUSE IT IS PRODUCED AS AN IMITATION OF SOMETHING ELSE WHEREFORE FOR INSTANCE AN EGG HOWEVER MUCH LIKE AND EQUAL TO ANOTHER EGG
THEREFORE THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS TO THE IMAGE OF GOD AND NOT ONLY MAN
BUT BY SIN MAN BECOMES UNLIKE GOD THEREFORE HE LOSES THE IMAGE OF GOD ON THE CONTRARY IT IS WRITTEN
BUT THERE IS NO SPECIES COMMON TO BOTH GOD AND MAN NOR CAN THERE BE A COMPARISON OF EQUALITY BETWEEN GOD AND MAN THEREFORE THERE CAN BE NO IMAGE OF GOD IN MAN ON THE CONTRARY IT IS WRITTEN
AS AUGUSTINE SAYS
WHICH HAS A CAPACITY FOR THE HIGHEST GOOD OR ELSE WE MAY SAY THAT A PART IS NOT RIGHTLY DIVIDED AGAINST THE WHOLE BUT ONLY AGAINST ANOTHER PART WHEREFORE WHEN WE SAY THAT THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE ALONE IS TO THE IMAGE OF GOD
THE RIB BELONGED TO THE INTEGRAL PERFECTION OF ADAM NOT AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT AS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE HUMAN RACE JUST AS THE SEMEN BELONGS TO THE PERFECTION OF THE BEGETTER AND IS RELEASED BY A NATURAL AND PLEASURABLE OPERATION
FOR THE SACRAMENTAL SIGNIFICATION FOR FROM THE SIDE OF CHRIST SLEEPING ON THE CROSS THE SACRAMENTS FLOWED NAMELY BLOOD AND WATER ON WHICH THE CHURCH WAS ESTABLISHED
IN THIS SENSE A CREATURE IS ONE WITH GOD OR LIKE TO HIM BUT WHEN HILARY SAYS OF A THING WHICH ADEQUATELY REPRESENTS ANOTHER THIS IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD OF A PERFECT IMAGE SECOND ARTICLE
WHEN IT IS SAID THAT GOD MADE MAN TO HIS IMAGE THIS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IN TWO WAYS FIRST SO THAT THIS PREPOSITION TO POINTS TO THE TERM OF THE MAKING AND THEN THE SENSE IS
AS UNITY MEANS ABSENCE OF DIVISION A SPECIES IS SAID TO BE THE SAME AS FAR AS IT IS ONE NOW A THING IS SAID TO BE ONE NOT ONLY NUMERICALLY SPECIFICALLY OR GENERICALLY BUT ALSO ACCORDING TO A CERTAIN ANALOGY OR PROPORTION
BECAUSE IF MAN WERE MADE ONLY TO THE IMAGE OF THE SON THE FATHER WOULD NOT HAVE SAID LET US MAKE MAN TO OUR OWN IMAGE AND LIKENESS BUT TO THY IMAGE WHEN THEREFORE IT IS WRITTEN HE MADE HIM TO THE IMAGE OF GOD
AND ONE IS THE IMAGE TO WHICH MAN WAS MADE AND HILARY
AS AUGUSTINE SAYS
ESPECIALLY AS GOD IS SO POWERFUL THAT HE CAN DIRECT ANY EVIL TO A GOOD END SECOND ARTICLE
IT IS NOT GOOD FOR MAN TO BE ALONE LET US MAKE HIM A HELPER LIKE TO HIMSELF I ANSWER THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR WOMAN TO BE MADE AS THE SCRIPTURE SAYS AS A HELPER TO MAN
AND THIS APTITUDE CONSISTS IN THE VERY NATURE OF THE MIND WHICH IS COMMON TO ALL MEN SECONDLY INASMUCH AS MAN ACTUALLY AND HABITUALLY KNOWS AND LOVES GOD THOUGH IMPERFECTLY
HE CREATED OF HIM THAT IS OUT OF MAN A HELPMATE LIKE TO HIMSELF THAT IS WOMAN I ANSWER THAT WHEN ALL THINGS WERE FIRST FORMED
THE GLOSS DISTINGUISHES A THREEFOLD IMAGE OF CREATION OF RE CREATION AND OF LIKENESS THE FIRST IS FOUND IN ALL MEN THE SECOND ONLY IN THE JUST
FOR THE WOMAN SHOULD NEITHER USE AUTHORITY OVER MAN AND SO SHE WAS NOT MADE FROM HIS HEAD NOR WAS IT RIGHT FOR HER TO BE SUBJECT TO MAN'S CONTEMPT AS HIS SLAVE AND SO SHE WAS NOT MADE FROM HIS FEET SECONDLY
THEREFORE THE MALE SEX IS NOT FOUND IN CONTINUAL UNION WITH THE FEMALE IN PERFECT ANIMALS BUT ONLY AT THE TIME OF COITION SO THAT WE MAY CONSIDER THAT BY THIS MEANS THE MALE AND FEMALE ARE ONE AS IN PLANTS THEY ARE ALWAYS UNITED
AND ALSO IN THE FACT THAT THE WHOLE HUMAN SOUL IS IN THE WHOLE BODY AND AGAIN IN EVERY PART AS GOD IS IN REGARD TO THE WHOLE WORLD IN THESE AND THE LIKE THINGS THE IMAGE OF GOD IS MORE PERFECT IN MAN THAN IT IS IN THE ANGELS
SOME SAY THAT THE WOMAN'S BODY WAS FORMED BY A MATERIAL INCREASE WITHOUT ANYTHING BEING ADDED IN THE SAME WAY AS OUR LORD MULTIPLIED THE FIVE LOAVES BUT THIS IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
AMONG PERFECT ANIMALS THE ACTIVE POWER OF GENERATION BELONGS TO THE MALE SEX AND THE PASSIVE POWER TO THE FEMALE AND AS AMONG ANIMALS THERE IS A VITAL OPERATION NOBLER THAN GENERATION TO WHICH THEIR LIFE IS PRINCIPALLY DIRECTED
FURTHER A RIB CANNOT BE REMOVED FROM MAN WITHOUT PAIN BUT THERE WAS NO PAIN BEFORE SIN
LET US MAKE MAN IN SUCH A WAY THAT OUR IMAGE MAY BE IN HIM SECONDLY THIS PREPOSITION TO MAY POINT TO THE EXEMPLAR CAUSE AS WHEN WE SAY THIS BOOK IS MADE LIKE TO THAT ONE
THEREFORE THE IMAGE OF GOD IN MAN REGARDS NOT THE TRINITY OF PERSONS BUT THE UNITY OF THE ESSENCE
