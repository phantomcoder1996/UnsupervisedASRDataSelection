AND FOUND EXISTENCE ALMOST SUPPORTABLE BECAUSE HE FELT THAT HE COULD THROW IT OFF AT PLEASURE LIKE A WORN OUT GARMENT TWO METHODS OF SELF DESTRUCTION WERE AT HIS DISPOSAL HE COULD HANG HIMSELF WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO THE WINDOW BARS
HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT WAS THE ENMITY OF MAN AND NOT THE VENGEANCE OF HEAVEN THAT HAD THUS PLUNGED HIM INTO THE DEEPEST MISERY HE CONSIGNED HIS UNKNOWN PERSECUTORS TO THE MOST HORRIBLE TORTURES HE COULD IMAGINE AND FOUND THEM ALL INSUFFICIENT
THE WINDOW GRATING WAS OF IRON BUT HE HAD TOO OFTEN ASSURED HIMSELF OF ITS SOLIDITY ALL HIS FURNITURE CONSISTED OF A BED A CHAIR A TABLE A PAIL AND A JUG THE BED HAD IRON CLAMPS BUT THEY WERE SCREWED TO THE WOOD
DANTES TOLD HIM THAT THE JUG HAD FALLEN FROM HIS HANDS WHILE HE WAS DRINKING AND THE JAILER WENT GRUMBLINGLY TO FETCH ANOTHER WITHOUT GIVING HIMSELF THE TROUBLE TO REMOVE THE FRAGMENTS OF THE BROKEN ONE HE RETURNED SPEEDILY ADVISED THE PRISONER TO BE MORE CAREFUL AND DEPARTED
BUT IN THE DARKNESS HE COULD NOT DO MUCH AND HE SOON FELT THAT HE WAS WORKING AGAINST SOMETHING VERY HARD HE PUSHED BACK HIS BED AND WAITED FOR DAY ALL NIGHT HE HEARD THE SUBTERRANEAN WORKMAN WHO CONTINUED TO MINE HIS WAY DAY CAME THE JAILER ENTERED
THEN HE RAISED TO HIS LIPS THE REPAST THAT LIKE A VOLUNTARY TANTALUS HE REFUSED HIMSELF BUT HE THOUGHT OF HIS OATH AND HE WOULD NOT BREAK IT HE PERSISTED UNTIL AT LAST
AND LOOKING FORWARD WITH TERROR TO HIS FUTURE EXISTENCE CHOSE THAT MIDDLE LINE THAT SEEMED TO AFFORD HIM A REFUGE SOMETIMES SAID HE IN MY VOYAGES WHEN I WAS A MAN AND COMMANDED OTHER MEN
BEFORE HIM IS A DEAD SEA THAT STRETCHES IN AZURE CALM BEFORE THE EYE BUT HE WHO UNWARILY VENTURES WITHIN ITS EMBRACE FINDS HIMSELF STRUGGLING WITH A MONSTER THAT WOULD DRAG HIM DOWN TO PERDITION ONCE THUS ENSNARED
FOR A CHANGE HOWEVER DISADVANTAGEOUS WAS STILL A CHANGE AND WOULD AFFORD HIM SOME AMUSEMENT HE ENTREATED TO BE ALLOWED TO WALK ABOUT TO HAVE FRESH AIR BOOKS AND WRITING MATERIALS HIS REQUESTS WERE NOT GRANTED
A FRENCHMAN YOUR NAME
AND REBUILD THE ANCIENT CITIES SO VAST AND STUPENDOUS IN THE LIGHT OF THE IMAGINATION AND THAT PASS BEFORE THE EYE GLOWING WITH CELESTIAL COLORS IN MARTIN'S BABYLONIAN PICTURES HE COULD NOT DO THIS HE WHOSE PAST LIFE WAS SO SHORT
SOON THE FURY OF THE WAVES AND THE SIGHT OF THE SHARP ROCKS ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF DEATH AND DEATH THEN TERRIFIED ME AND I USED ALL MY SKILL AND INTELLIGENCE AS A MAN AND A SAILOR TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE WRATH OF GOD BUT I DID SO BECAUSE I WAS HAPPY
HE HELD THE PLATE IN HIS HAND FOR AN HOUR AT A TIME AND GAZED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MORSEL OF BAD MEAT OF TAINTED FISH OF BLACK AND MOULDY BREAD IT WAS THE LAST YEARNING FOR LIFE CONTENDING WITH THE RESOLUTION OF DESPAIR
WHEN THE JAILER MOVED HIS BED AND STOOPED TO EXAMINE THE OPENING HE WOULD KILL HIM WITH HIS WATER JUG HE WOULD BE CONDEMNED TO DIE BUT HE WAS ABOUT TO DIE OF GRIEF AND DESPAIR WHEN THIS MIRACULOUS NOISE RECALLED HIM TO LIFE THE JAILER CAME IN THE EVENING
AS HE KNELT WITH HIS HEAD IN THE OPENING SUDDENLY GAVE WAY HE DREW BACK SMARTLY WHILE A MASS OF STONES AND EARTH DISAPPEARED IN A HOLE THAT OPENED BENEATH THE APERTURE HE HIMSELF HAD FORMED
EDMOND HEARD A HOLLOW SOUND IN THE WALL AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LYING SO MANY LOATHSOME ANIMALS INHABITED THE PRISON THAT THEIR NOISE DID NOT IN GENERAL AWAKE HIM BUT WHETHER ABSTINENCE HAD QUICKENED HIS FACULTIES
HE WAS SUSTAINED AT FIRST BY THAT PRIDE OF CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE WHICH IS THE SEQUENCE TO HOPE THEN HE BEGAN TO DOUBT HIS OWN INNOCENCE WHICH JUSTIFIED IN SOME MEASURE THE GOVERNOR'S BELIEF IN HIS MENTAL ALIENATION AND THEN RELAXING HIS SENTIMENT OF PRIDE
HE HAD OFTEN HEARD THAT SHIPWRECKED PERSONS HAD DIED THROUGH HAVING EAGERLY DEVOURED TOO MUCH FOOD EDMOND REPLACED ON THE TABLE THE BREAD HE WAS ABOUT TO DEVOUR AND RETURNED TO HIS COUCH HE DID NOT WISH TO DIE
SOME HOURS AFTERWARDS IT BEGAN AGAIN NEARER AND MORE DISTINCT EDMOND WAS INTENSELY INTERESTED SUDDENLY THE JAILER ENTERED
YOU DESTROY EVERYTHING FIRST YOU BREAK YOUR JUG THEN YOU MAKE ME BREAK YOUR PLATE IF ALL THE PRISONERS FOLLOWED YOUR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE RUINED I SHALL LEAVE YOU THE SAUCEPAN AND POUR YOUR SOUP INTO THAT SO FOR THE FUTURE I HOPE YOU WILL NOT BE SO DESTRUCTIVE
I TOOK THE WALL YOU ARE MINING FOR THE OUTER WALL OF THE FORTRESS BUT THEN YOU WOULD BE CLOSE TO THE SEA THAT IS WHAT I HOPED AND SUPPOSING YOU HAD SUCCEEDED I SHOULD HAVE THROWN MYSELF INTO THE SEA
THE DAY PASSED AWAY IN UTTER SILENCE NIGHT CAME WITHOUT RECURRENCE OF THE NOISE IT IS A PRISONER SAID EDMOND JOYFULLY THE NIGHT PASSED IN PERFECT SILENCE EDMOND DID NOT CLOSE HIS EYES
DANTES MIND HAD REVOLTED AT THE IDEA OF ASSEMBLAGES OF PRISONERS MADE UP OF THIEVES VAGABONDS AND MURDERERS HE NOW WISHED TO BE AMONGST THEM IN ORDER TO SEE SOME OTHER FACE BESIDES THAT OF HIS JAILER
HE FELT MORE GRATITUDE FOR THE POSSESSION OF THIS PIECE OF IRON THAN HE HAD EVER FELT FOR ANYTHING HE HAD NOTICED HOWEVER THAT THE PRISONER ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD CEASED TO LABOR NO MATTER THIS WAS A GREATER REASON FOR PROCEEDING
WHO TALKS OF GOD AND DESPAIR AT THE SAME TIME SAID A VOICE THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM BENEATH THE EARTH
BUT AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR HE HAD SCRAPED OFF A HANDFUL A MATHEMATICIAN MIGHT HAVE CALCULATED THAT IN TWO YEARS SUPPOSING THAT THE ROCK WAS NOT ENCOUNTERED A PASSAGE TWENTY FEET LONG AND TWO FEET BROAD MIGHT BE FORMED
I SWEAR TO YOU AGAIN RATHER THAN BETRAY YOU I WOULD ALLOW MYSELF TO BE HACKED IN PIECES
BUT NOW THE JAILER MIGHT HEAR THE NOISE AND PUT AN END TO IT AND SO DESTROY A RAY OF SOMETHING LIKE HOPE THAT SOOTHED HIS LAST MOMENTS THE JAILER BROUGHT HIM HIS BREAKFAST
AND WEARYING THE PATIENCE OF HIS JAILER WHO OUT OF KINDNESS OF HEART HAD BROUGHT BROTH AND WHITE BREAD FOR HIS PRISONER FORTUNATELY HE FANCIED THAT DANTES WAS DELIRIOUS AND PLACING THE FOOD ON THE RICKETY TABLE HE WITHDREW
WHO DID NOT GUESS HE HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY A CAPTIVE AS ANXIOUS FOR LIBERTY AS HIMSELF THREE DAYS PASSED SEVENTY TWO LONG TEDIOUS HOURS WHICH HE COUNTED OFF BY MINUTES AT LENGTH ONE EVENING
AND HE LAID THE REQUEST OF NUMBER THIRTY FOUR BEFORE THE GOVERNOR BUT THE LATTER SAPIENTLY IMAGINED THAT DANTES WISHED TO CONSPIRE OR ATTEMPT AN ESCAPE AND REFUSED HIS REQUEST DANTES HAD EXHAUSTED ALL HUMAN RESOURCES
HE MOVED AWAY WALKED UP AND DOWN HIS CELL TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS AND THEN WENT BACK AND LISTENED THE MATTER WAS NO LONGER DOUBTFUL SOMETHING WAS AT WORK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL
SO THAT THE LEAST THING A GRAIN OF SAND A STRAW OR A BREATH OF AIR THAT ANNOYED HIM LED TO PAROXYSMS OF FURY THEN THE LETTER THAT VILLEFORT HAD SHOWED TO HIM RECURRED TO HIS MIND
FOR THE EMPEROR'S RETURN THE EMPEROR IS NO LONGER ON THE THRONE THEN HE ABDICATED AT FONTAINEBLEAU IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN AND WAS SENT TO THE ISLAND OF ELBA BUT HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE THAT YOU ARE IGNORANT OF ALL THIS
HEAVEN WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME STRENGTH BUT NOW ALL IS LOST ALL YES STOP UP YOUR EXCAVATION CAREFULLY DO NOT WORK ANY MORE AND WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM ME TELL ME AT LEAST WHO YOU ARE I AM
NOW WHEN EVENING CAME DANTES PUT HIS PLATE ON THE GROUND NEAR THE DOOR THE JAILER AS HE ENTERED STEPPED ON IT AND BROKE IT
AT THE END OF THE SECOND HE HAD CEASED TO MARK THE LAPSE OF TIME DANTES SAID I WISH TO DIE AND HAD CHOSEN THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH AND FEARFUL OF CHANGING HIS MIND HE HAD TAKEN AN OATH TO DIE
YOU OF THOSE WHOM YOU LOVE AND I OF THOSE WHOM I LOVE YOU MUST LOVE SOMEBODY NO I AM ALONE IN THE WORLD THEN YOU WILL LOVE ME IF YOU ARE YOUNG I WILL BE YOUR COMRADE IF YOU ARE OLD I WILL BE YOUR SON
UNLESS THE PROTECTING HAND OF GOD SNATCH HIM THENCE ALL IS OVER AND HIS STRUGGLES BUT TEND TO HASTEN HIS DESTRUCTION THIS STATE OF MENTAL ANGUISH IS HOWEVER LESS TERRIBLE THAN THE SUFFERINGS THAT PRECEDE
BUT HE WENT ON ASKING ALL THE SAME HE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SPEAKING TO THE NEW JAILER ALTHOUGH THE LATTER WAS IF POSSIBLE MORE TACITURN THAN THE OLD ONE BUT STILL TO SPEAK TO A MAN EVEN THOUGH MUTE WAS SOMETHING
I HAVE A FATHER WHO IS SEVENTY IF HE YET LIVES I ONLY LOVE HIM AND A YOUNG GIRL CALLED MERCEDES MY FATHER HAS NOT YET FORGOTTEN ME I AM SURE BUT GOD ALONE KNOWS IF SHE LOVES ME STILL I SHALL LOVE YOU AS I LOVED MY FATHER
HE HAD NOT SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO RISE AND CAST HIS SUPPER OUT OF THE LOOPHOLE THE NEXT MORNING HE COULD NOT SEE OR HEAR THE JAILER FEARED HE WAS DANGEROUSLY ILL EDMOND HOPED HE WAS DYING THUS THE DAY PASSED AWAY
AND IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A SCREW DRIVER TO TAKE THEM OFF THE TABLE AND CHAIR HAD NOTHING THE PAIL HAD ONCE POSSESSED A HANDLE BUT THAT HAD BEEN REMOVED
EDMOND FANCIED HE HEARD A BITTER LAUGH RESOUNDING FROM THE DEPTHS
PUSHED HIS BED AGAINST THE WALL AND LAY DOWN THE BREAKFAST CONSISTED OF A PIECE OF BREAD THE JAILER ENTERED AND PLACED THE BREAD ON THE TABLE WELL DON'T YOU INTEND TO BRING ME ANOTHER PLATE SAID DANTES NO REPLIED THE TURNKEY
IF IT IS A WORKMAN I NEED BUT KNOCK AGAINST THE WALL AND HE WILL CEASE TO WORK IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHO IS KNOCKING AND WHY HE DOES SO BUT AS HIS OCCUPATION IS SANCTIONED BY THE GOVERNOR HE WILL SOON RESUME IT
HE SOON FELT THAT HIS IDEAS BECAME AGAIN COLLECTED HE COULD THINK AND STRENGTHEN HIS THOUGHTS BY REASONING THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF I MUST PUT THIS TO THE TEST BUT WITHOUT COMPROMISING ANYBODY
EDMOND'S HAIR STOOD ON END AND HE ROSE TO HIS KNEES AH SAID HE I HEAR A HUMAN VOICE EDMOND HAD NOT HEARD ANY ONE SPEAK SAVE HIS JAILER FOR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS
WAS HE TO BE THUS STOPPED AT THE BEGINNING AND WAS HE TO WAIT INACTIVE UNTIL HIS FELLOW WORKMAN HAD COMPLETED HIS TASK SUDDENLY AN IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM HE SMILED AND THE PERSPIRATION DRIED ON HIS FOREHEAD
AND A JAILER IS NO MAN TO A PRISONER HE IS A LIVING DOOR A BARRIER OF FLESH AND BLOOD ADDING STRENGTH TO RESTRAINTS OF OAK AND IRON
A SAILOR HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE SINCE THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN YOUR CRIME I AM INNOCENT
HIS ENERGETIC SPIRIT THAT WOULD HAVE EXALTED IN THUS REVISITING THE PAST WAS IMPRISONED LIKE AN EAGLE IN A CAGE HE CLUNG TO ONE IDEA THAT OF HIS HAPPINESS DESTROYED WITHOUT APPARENT CAUSE BY AN UNHEARD OF FATALITY
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HEAVEN HAD AT LENGTH TAKEN PITY ON HIM AND HAD SENT THIS NOISE TO WARN HIM ON THE VERY BRINK OF THE ABYSS PERHAPS ONE OF THOSE BELOVED ONES HE HAD SO OFTEN THOUGHT OF WAS THINKING OF HIM
TWO HOURS PASSED AND NO SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE WALL ALL WAS SILENT THERE FULL OF HOPE EDMOND SWALLOWED A FEW MOUTHFULS OF BREAD AND WATER AND THANKS TO THE VIGOR OF HIS CONSTITUTION FOUND HIMSELF WELL NIGH RECOVERED
DANTES RAISED HIMSELF UP AND BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BAD QUALITY OF THE FOOD ABOUT THE COLDNESS OF HIS DUNGEON GRUMBLING AND COMPLAINING IN ORDER TO HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR SPEAKING LOUDER
AND HE THEN TURNED TO GOD ALL THE PIOUS IDEAS THAT HAD BEEN SO LONG FORGOTTEN RETURNED HE RECOLLECTED THE PRAYERS HIS MOTHER HAD TAUGHT HIM
DANTES WAS ON HIS BED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THUS HE BETTER GUARDED THE UNFINISHED OPENING DOUBTLESS THERE WAS A STRANGE EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES FOR THE JAILER SAID COME ARE YOU GOING MAD AGAIN DANTES DID NOT ANSWER
THE PRISONER REPROACHED HIMSELF WITH NOT HAVING THUS EMPLOYED THE HOURS HE HAD PASSED IN VAIN HOPES PRAYER AND DESPONDENCY DURING THE SIX YEARS THAT HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED WHAT MIGHT HE NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
IF ON THE CONTRARY IT IS A PRISONER THE NOISE I MAKE WILL ALARM HIM HE WILL CEASE AND NOT BEGIN AGAIN UNTIL HE THINKS EVERY ONE IS ASLEEP EDMOND ROSE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME HIS LEGS DID NOT TREMBLE AND HIS SIGHT WAS CLEAR
AND WITHOUT EDUCATION HE COULD NOT THEREFORE IN THE SOLITUDE OF HIS DUNGEON TRAVERSE IN MENTAL VISION THE HISTORY OF THE AGES BRING TO LIFE THE NATIONS THAT HAD PERISHED
ALL I DO KNOW IS THAT I WAS JUST NINETEEN WHEN I WAS ARRESTED THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN NOT QUITE TWENTY SIX MURMURED THE VOICE AT THAT AGE HE CANNOT BE A TRAITOR
WHO ARE HUNG UP TO THE YARD ARM HE WOULD NOT DIE BY WHAT SEEMED AN INFAMOUS DEATH HE RESOLVED TO ADOPT THE SECOND AND BEGAN THAT DAY TO CARRY OUT HIS RESOLVE NEARLY FOUR YEARS HAD PASSED AWAY
HE LET THE JUG FALL ON THE FLOOR AND IT BROKE IN PIECES DANTES CONCEALED TWO OR THREE OF THE SHARPEST FRAGMENTS IN HIS BED LEAVING THE REST ON THE FLOOR THE BREAKING OF HIS JUG WAS TOO NATURAL AN ACCIDENT TO EXCITE SUSPICION EDMOND HAD ALL THE NIGHT TO WORK IN
IT WAS ONE OF THESE HE HAD UNCOVERED AND WHICH HE MUST REMOVE FROM ITS SOCKET DANTES STROVE TO DO THIS WITH HIS NAILS BUT THEY WERE TOO WEAK THE FRAGMENTS OF THE JUG BROKE AND AFTER AN HOUR OF USELESS TOIL HE PAUSED
YES SAID DANTES HE WILL NOT RETURN UNTIL THE EVENING SO THAT WE HAVE TWELVE HOURS BEFORE US I CAN WORK THEN SAID THE VOICE OH YES YES THIS INSTANT I ENTREAT YOU IN A MOMENT THAT PART OF THE FLOOR ON WHICH DANTES WAS RESTING HIS TWO HANDS
THE JAILER ALWAYS BROUGHT DANTES SOUP IN AN IRON SAUCEPAN THIS SAUCEPAN CONTAINED SOUP FOR BOTH PRISONERS
NO SOONER HAD THIS IDEA TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIM THAN HE BECAME MORE COMPOSED ARRANGED HIS COUCH TO THE BEST OF HIS POWER ATE LITTLE AND SLEPT LESS
WHEN MY MORNING AND EVENING MEALS ARE BROUGHT THOUGHT HE I WILL CAST THEM OUT OF THE WINDOW AND THEY WILL THINK THAT I HAVE EATEN THEM HE KEPT HIS WORD TWICE A DAY HE CAST OUT THROUGH THE BARRED APERTURE THE PROVISIONS HIS JAILER BROUGHT HIM
IT WAS EASY TO ASCERTAIN THIS BUT HOW COULD HE RISK THE QUESTION IT WAS EASY TO CALL HIS JAILER'S ATTENTION TO THE NOISE AND WATCH HIS COUNTENANCE AS HE LISTENED
IT IS WELL RETURNED THE VOICE TO MORROW
WHOSE PRESENT SO MELANCHOLY AND HIS FUTURE SO DOUBTFUL NINETEEN YEARS OF LIGHT TO REFLECT UPON IN ETERNAL DARKNESS NO DISTRACTION COULD COME TO HIS AID
I HAVE SEEN THE HEAVENS OVERCAST THE SEA RAGE AND FOAM THE STORM ARISE AND LIKE A MONSTROUS BIRD BEATING THE TWO HORIZONS WITH ITS WINGS THEN I FELT THAT MY VESSEL WAS A VAIN REFUGE THAT TREMBLED AND SHOOK BEFORE THE TEMPEST
THE PRISONER HAD DISCOVERED THE DANGER AND HAD SUBSTITUTED A LEVER FOR A CHISEL ENCOURAGED BY THIS DISCOVERY EDMOND DETERMINED TO ASSIST THE INDEFATIGABLE LABORER
SINCE EIGHTEEN ELEVEN DANTES SHUDDERED THIS MAN HAD BEEN FOUR YEARS LONGER THAN HIMSELF IN PRISON DO NOT DIG ANY MORE SAID THE VOICE ONLY TELL ME HOW HIGH UP IS YOUR EXCAVATION
YET IN SPITE OF HIS EARNEST PRAYERS DANTES REMAINED A PRISONER THEN GLOOM SETTLED HEAVILY UPON HIM
BECAUSE AFTER TORTURE CAME DEATH AND AFTER DEATH IF NOT REPOSE AT LEAST THE BOON OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY DINT OF CONSTANTLY DWELLING ON THE IDEA THAT TRANQUILLITY WAS DEATH
RESTORING VIGOR AND AGILITY TO HIS LIMBS BY EXERCISE AND SO PREPARING HIMSELF FOR HIS FUTURE DESTINY AT INTERVALS HE LISTENED TO LEARN IF THE NOISE HAD NOT BEGUN AGAIN AND GREW IMPATIENT AT THE PRUDENCE OF THE PRISONER
PROPOSED TASKS TO ACCOMPLISH AND AT THE END OF EVERY PRAYER INTRODUCED THE ENTREATY OFTENER ADDRESSED TO MAN THAN TO GOD FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES AS WE FORGIVE THEM THAT TRESPASS AGAINST US
IT WAS NECESSARY THEREFORE TO DIG ABOVE OR UNDER IT THE UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THIS O MY GOD MY GOD MURMURED HE I HAVE SO EARNESTLY PRAYED TO YOU THAT I HOPED MY PRAYERS HAD BEEN HEARD
ALL HIS SORROWS ALL HIS SUFFERINGS WITH THEIR TRAIN OF GLOOMY SPECTRES FLED FROM HIS CELL WHEN THE ANGEL OF DEATH SEEMED ABOUT TO ENTER DANTES REVIEWED HIS PAST LIFE WITH COMPOSURE
DEVOURED IT SO TO SPEAK AS THE IMPLACABLE UGOLINO DEVOURS THE SKULL OF ARCHBISHOP ROGER IN THE INFERNO OF DANTE RAGE SUPPLANTED RELIGIOUS FERVOR
SUDDENLY ANOTHER IDEA TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS MIND SO USED TO MISFORTUNE THAT IT WAS SCARCELY CAPABLE OF HOPE THE IDEA THAT THE NOISE WAS MADE BY WORKMEN THE GOVERNOR HAD ORDERED TO REPAIR THE NEIGHBORING DUNGEON
HOW OLD ARE YOU YOUR VOICE IS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN
ON A LEVEL WITH THE FLOOR HOW IS IT CONCEALED BEHIND MY BED HAS YOUR BED BEEN MOVED SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN A PRISONER NO WHAT DOES YOUR CHAMBER OPEN ON A CORRIDOR AND THE CORRIDOR ON A COURT
HE WENT TO A CORNER OF HIS DUNGEON DETACHED A STONE AND WITH IT KNOCKED AGAINST THE WALL WHERE THE SOUND CAME HE STRUCK THRICE AT THE FIRST BLOW THE SOUND CEASED AS IF BY MAGIC EDMOND LISTENED INTENTLY AN HOUR PASSED
CARRIED IT INTO THE CORNER OF HIS CELL AND COVERED IT WITH EARTH THEN WISHING TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF HIS TIME WHILE HE HAD THE MEANS OF LABOR HE CONTINUED TO WORK WITHOUT CEASING AT THE DAWN OF DAY HE REPLACED THE STONE
HE RAPIDLY DEVOURED HIS FOOD AND AFTER WAITING AN HOUR LEST THE JAILER SHOULD CHANGE HIS MIND AND RETURN HE REMOVED HIS BED TOOK THE HANDLE OF THE SAUCEPAN INSERTED THE POINT BETWEEN THE HEWN STONE AND ROUGH STONES OF THE WALL AND EMPLOYED IT AS A LEVER
HE WAS WRONG TO LEAVE IT THERE BUT THE JAILER WAS WRONG NOT TO HAVE LOOKED BEFORE HIM THE JAILER THEREFORE ONLY GRUMBLED THEN HE LOOKED ABOUT FOR SOMETHING TO POUR THE SOUP INTO DANTES ENTIRE DINNER SERVICE CONSISTED OF ONE PLATE THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE
HE SIGHED FOR THE GALLEYS WITH THE INFAMOUS COSTUME THE CHAIN AND THE BRAND ON THE SHOULDER THE GALLEY SLAVES BREATHED THE FRESH AIR OF HEAVEN AND SAW EACH OTHER THEY WERE VERY HAPPY HE BESOUGHT THE JAILER ONE DAY TO LET HIM HAVE A COMPANION WERE IT EVEN THE MAD ABBE
OR REFUSE FOOD AND DIE OF STARVATION BUT THE FIRST WAS REPUGNANT TO HIM
OR WHETHER THE NOISE WAS REALLY LOUDER THAN USUAL EDMOND RAISED HIS HEAD AND LISTENED IT WAS A CONTINUAL SCRATCHING AS IF MADE BY A HUGE CLAW A POWERFUL TOOTH OR SOME IRON INSTRUMENT ATTACKING THE STONES
JUST AS HE REMOVED HIS BED FROM THE WALL HE HEARD THREE KNOCKS HE THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES IS IT YOU SAID HE I AM HERE IS YOUR JAILER GONE
I SWEAR TO YOU BY HIM WHO DIED FOR US THAT NAUGHT SHALL INDUCE ME TO BREATHE ONE SYLLABLE TO MY JAILERS BUT I CONJURE YOU DO NOT ABANDON ME IF YOU DO I SWEAR TO YOU FOR I HAVE GOT TO THE END OF MY STRENGTH
IN THE MORNING THE JAILER BROUGHT HIM FRESH PROVISIONS HE HAD ALREADY DEVOURED THOSE OF THE PREVIOUS DAY HE ATE THESE LISTENING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE SOUND WALKING ROUND AND ROUND HIS CELL
AT THE END OF AN HOUR THE STONE WAS EXTRICATED FROM THE WALL LEAVING A CAVITY A FOOT AND A HALF IN DIAMETER
WHEN THE HOUR FOR HIS JAILER'S VISIT ARRIVED DANTES STRAIGHTENED THE HANDLE OF THE SAUCEPAN AS WELL AS HE COULD AND PLACED IT IN ITS ACCUSTOMED PLACE THE TURNKEY POURED HIS RATION OF SOUP INTO IT TOGETHER WITH THE FISH
AFTER HAVING DEPRIVED ME OF MY LIBERTY AFTER HAVING DEPRIVED ME OF DEATH AFTER HAVING RECALLED ME TO EXISTENCE MY GOD HAVE PITY ON ME AND DO NOT LET ME DIE IN DESPAIR
HE ADDRESSED HIS SUPPLICATIONS NOT TO GOD BUT TO MAN GOD IS ALWAYS THE LAST RESOURCE UNFORTUNATES WHO OUGHT TO BEGIN WITH GOD DO NOT HAVE ANY HOPE IN HIM TILL THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OTHER MEANS OF DELIVERANCE
HIS PROSPECTS LESS DESPERATE HE WAS STILL YOUNG HE WAS ONLY FOUR OR FIVE AND TWENTY HE HAD NEARLY FIFTY YEARS TO LIVE WHAT UNFORSEEN EVENTS MIGHT NOT OPEN HIS PRISON DOOR AND RESTORE HIM TO LIBERTY
DANTES SPOKE FOR THE SAKE OF HEARING HIS OWN VOICE HE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK WHEN ALONE BUT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TERRIFIED HIM OFTEN BEFORE HIS CAPTIVITY
HE LISTENED ALL WAS SILENT AS IT HAD BEEN FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS DANTES SIGHED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS NEIGHBOR DISTRUSTED HIM HOWEVER HE TOILED ON ALL THE NIGHT WITHOUT BEING DISCOURAGED
AND DURING THE FOUR DAYS THAT HE HAD BEEN CARRYING OUT HIS PURPOSE EDMOND HAD NOT SPOKEN TO THE ATTENDANT HAD NOT ANSWERED HIM WHEN HE INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM AND TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL WHEN HE LOOKED TOO CURIOUSLY AT HIM
HE FEARED THAT THE EMOTION OF HIS VOICE WOULD BETRAY HIM THE JAILER WENT AWAY SHAKING HIS HEAD NIGHT CAME DANTES HOPED THAT HIS NEIGHBOR WOULD PROFIT BY THE SILENCE TO ADDRESS HIM BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER
OR THE PUNISHMENT THAT POSSIBLY WILL FOLLOW THERE IS A SORT OF CONSOLATION AT THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE YAWNING ABYSS AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH LIE DARKNESS AND OBSCURITY EDMOND FOUND SOME SOLACE IN THESE IDEAS
I HAVE LOST ALL THAT BOUND ME TO LIFE DEATH SMILES AND INVITES ME TO REPOSE I DIE AFTER MY OWN MANNER I DIE EXHAUSTED AND BROKEN SPIRITED AS I FALL ASLEEP WHEN I HAVE PACED THREE THOUSAND TIMES ROUND MY CELL
AS THE JAILER WAS VISITING HIM FOR THE LAST TIME THAT NIGHT
AT FIRST GAYLY THEN WITH DELIBERATION AND AT LAST WITH REGRET NOTHING BUT THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS OATH GAVE HIM STRENGTH TO PROCEED
YOU CAN TAKE IT AWAY WHEN YOU BRING ME MY BREAKFAST THIS ADVICE WAS TO THE JAILER'S TASTE AS IT SPARED HIM THE NECESSITY OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIP HE LEFT THE SAUCEPAN
ALAS MURMURED THE VOICE OH WHAT IS THE MATTER CRIED DANTES I HAVE MADE A MISTAKE OWING TO AN ERROR IN MY PLANS I TOOK THE WRONG ANGLE AND HAVE COME OUT FIFTEEN FEET FROM WHERE I INTENDED
HE TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE SOUP WHICH THE JAILER HAD BROUGHT ROSE STAGGERED TOWARDS IT RAISED THE VESSEL TO HIS LIPS AND DRANK OFF THE CONTENTS WITH A FEELING OF INDESCRIBABLE PLEASURE
AND IF PUNISHMENT WERE THE END IN VIEW OTHER TORTURES THAN DEATH MUST BE INVENTED HE BEGAN TO REFLECT ON SUICIDE UNHAPPY HE WHO ON THE BRINK OF MISFORTUNE BROODS OVER IDEAS LIKE THESE
DANTES HEARD JOYFULLY THE KEY GRATE IN THE LOCK HE LISTENED UNTIL THE SOUND OF STEPS DIED AWAY AND THEN HASTILY DISPLACING HIS BED SAW BY THE FAINT LIGHT THAT PENETRATED INTO HIS CELL
DANTES UTTERED BLASPHEMIES THAT MADE HIS JAILER RECOIL WITH HORROR DASHED HIMSELF FURIOUSLY AGAINST THE WALLS OF HIS PRISON WREAKED HIS ANGER UPON EVERYTHING AND CHIEFLY UPON HIMSELF
AND CAPTIVITY THAT IS SHARED IS BUT HALF CAPTIVITY PLAINTS MADE IN COMMON ARE ALMOST PRAYERS AND PRAYERS WHERE TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER INVOKE THE MERCY OF HEAVEN
IF HIS NEIGHBOR WOULD NOT COME TO HIM HE WOULD GO TO HIS NEIGHBOR ALL DAY HE TOILED ON UNTIRINGLY AND BY THE EVENING HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN EXTRACTING TEN HANDFULS OF PLASTER AND FRAGMENTS OF STONE
AND DISCOVERED A NEW MEANING IN EVERY WORD FOR IN PROSPERITY PRAYERS SEEM BUT A MERE MEDLEY OF WORDS UNTIL MISFORTUNE COMES AND THE UNHAPPY SUFFERER FIRST UNDERSTANDS THE MEANING
AND STRIVING TO DIMINISH THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATED THEM NO NO DOUBTLESS HE WAS DECEIVED AND IT WAS BUT ONE OF THOSE DREAMS THAT FORERUN DEATH
IN THREE DAYS HE HAD SUCCEEDED WITH THE UTMOST PRECAUTION IN REMOVING THE CEMENT AND EXPOSING THE STONE WORK THE WALL WAS BUILT OF ROUGH STONES AMONG WHICH TO GIVE STRENGTH TO THE STRUCTURE BLOCKS OF HEWN STONE WERE AT INTERVALS IMBEDDED
OF HAVING CONSPIRED TO AID THE EMPEROR'S RETURN
AND THROUGH THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO CHANGE ANY OF THE CUSTOMS OF THEIR PATERNAL HOUSE TAKING SIX YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT LESS SCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE EFFECTED IN TWO OR THREE MARSEILLES RESOUNDED WITH THEIR WELL EARNED PRAISES AT LAST ONE DAY EMMANUEL CAME TO HIS WIFE WHO HAD JUST FINISHED MAKING UP THE ACCOUNTS
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THOROUGHFARES IN THE CITY OF PARIS IN MATTERS OF SPECULATION HOWEVER THOUGH MAN PROPOSES MONEY DISPOSES FROM SOME SUCH DIFFICULTY THE NEWLY NAMED STREET DIED ALMOST IN BIRTH
THE INCESSANT AND MELODIOUS WARBLING OF BIRDS AND THE ENTIRE REMOVAL FROM EITHER THE NOISE OF THE STREET OR THE BUSTLE OF THE MANSION ON THE EVENING OF ONE OF THE WARMEST DAYS SPRING HAD YET BESTOWED ON THE INHABITANTS OF PARIS
OH WOULD WE COULD RELATE IT EVERYWHERE AND TO EVERY ONE SO THAT THE EMOTION OF OUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR MIGHT REVEAL HIS PRESENCE
ENDEAVORING TO DISCERN SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE BY MEANS OF THE OPENINGS IN THE PLANKS THE EARNESTNESS OF HER ATTITUDE AND THE FIXED GAZE WITH WHICH SHE SEEMED TO SEEK THE OBJECT OF HER WISHES PROVING HOW MUCH HER FEELINGS WERE INTERESTED IN THE MATTER
SUCH FELICITY SEEMS ABOVE ALL PRICE AS A THING IMPOSSIBLE AND UNATTAINABLE BUT WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT I PURCHASE ALL THIS DELIGHT JOY AND HAPPINESS
THAT WOULD COMPROMISE THE HONOR OF THE FRENCH ARMY TO SAY NOTHING OF THE FACT THAT THE CONTINUAL PRESENCE OF A CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS IN A PLACE WHERE NO WARLIKE PROJECTS COULD BE SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR IT MIGHT WELL CREATE SURPRISE
BUT CONTENTMENT IS SO NEW A SIGHT TO ME THAT I COULD NEVER BE WEARY OF LOOKING AT YOURSELF AND YOUR HUSBAND WE ARE VERY HAPPY MONSIEUR REPLIED JULIE BUT WE HAVE ALSO KNOWN UNHAPPINESS AND FEW HAVE EVER UNDERGONE MORE BITTER SUFFERINGS THAN OURSELVES
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO STOP THE ISSUE OF ANY MORE AND CLOSE OUR OFFICE THIS WAS DONE INSTANTLY IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK AT A QUARTER PAST A MERCHANT PRESENTED HIMSELF TO INSURE TWO SHIPS IT WAS A CLEAR PROFIT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
SAW ON THE QUAY AN ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS ON THE POINT OF EMBARKING ON BOARD A YACHT AND HE RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE PERSON WHO CALLED ON MY FATHER THE FIFTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE AND WHO WROTE ME THIS LETTER ON THE FIFTH OF SEPTEMBER HE FELT CONVINCED OF HIS IDENTITY BUT HE DID NOT VENTURE TO ADDRESS HIM
THERE WAS A STUDY FOR EMMANUEL WHO NEVER STUDIED AND A MUSIC ROOM FOR JULIE WHO NEVER PLAYED THE WHOLE OF THE SECOND STORY WAS SET APART FOR MAXIMILIAN IT WAS PRECISELY SIMILAR TO HIS SISTER'S APARTMENTS EXCEPT THAT FOR THE BREAKFAST PARLOR HE HAD A BILLIARD ROOM
HE MEANS THAT THE ARTICLES CONTAINED IN THIS PURSE ARE THE RELICS OF THE ANGEL I SPOKE OF JUST NOW THIS I DO NOT COMPREHEND AND YET I MAY NOT ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BOWING
HAD LORD WILMORE SEEN WHAT I NOW SEE HE WOULD BECOME ATTACHED TO LIFE FOR THE TEARS YOU SHED WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO MANKIND AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO JULIE WHO GAVE HIM HERS CARRIED AWAY BY THE LOOK AND ACCENT OF THE COUNT
WHICH IS EVIDENTLY NOT HIS REAL NAME BUT A FICTITIOUS ONE THEN NOTICING THAT JULIE WAS STRUCK WITH THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TELL ME CONTINUED HE WAS HE NOT ABOUT MY HEIGHT PERHAPS A LITTLE TALLER WITH HIS CHIN IMPRISONED AS IT WERE IN A HIGH CRAVAT
IF IT BE BUT TO CARRY AWAY WITH ME THE RECOLLECTION OF SUCH SWEET MOMENTS I COULD EVEN THANK YOU FOR CHIDING ME FOR IT LEAVES ME A GLEAM OF HOPE THAT IF YOU DID NOT EXPECT ME AND THAT INDEED WOULD BE WORSE THAN VANITY TO SUPPOSE
AND WHERE CABBAGES CARROTS RADISHES PEASE AND MELONS HAD ONCE FLOURISHED A SCANTY CROP OF LUCERNE ALONE BORE EVIDENCE OF ITS BEING DEEMED WORTHY OF CULTIVATION
AND THE YOUNG OFFICER SHOOK THE COUNT'S HAND SO WARMLY THAT MONTE CRISTO COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS TO THE SINCERITY OF HIS JOY AND HE SAW THAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTED WITH IMPATIENCE AND WAS RECEIVED WITH PLEASURE
MIGHT BE SEEN NEGLIGENTLY THROWN UPON THE STONE BENCH A BOOK A PARASOL AND A WORK BASKET FROM WHICH HUNG A PARTLY EMBROIDERED CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF WHILE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THESE ARTICLES WAS A YOUNG WOMAN STANDING CLOSE TO THE IRON GATE
AND SO AS WE HAVE SAID THE IRON GATE LEADING INTO THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAD BEEN CLOSED UP AND LEFT TO THE RUST WHICH BADE FAIR BEFORE LONG TO EAT OFF ITS HINGES WHILE TO PREVENT THE IGNOBLE GLANCES OF THE DIGGERS AND DELVERS OF THE GROUND
A SMALL LOW DOOR GAVE EGRESS FROM THE WALLED SPACE WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING INTO THE PROJECTED STREET THE GROUND HAVING BEEN ABANDONED AS UNPRODUCTIVE BY ITS VARIOUS RENTERS
FOR THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY YEARS THAT I HAVE THUS YIELDED TO MY FEELINGS AND HE HASTILY QUITTED THE APARTMENT THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO IS A STRANGE MAN SAID EMMANUEL YES ANSWERED MAXIMILIAN BUT I FEEL SURE HE HAS AN EXCELLENT HEART AND THAT HE LIKES US
THE COUNT'S FEATURES DISPLAYED AN EXPRESSION OF THE MOST INTENSE CURIOSITY OH ALL THIS IS A FAMILY HISTORY AS CHATEAU RENAUD TOLD YOU THE OTHER DAY OBSERVED MAXIMILIAN
DEAREST VALENTINE SAID THE YOUNG MAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR RESPECTIVE STATIONS MAKES ME FEAR TO OFFEND YOU BY SPEAKING OF MY LOVE BUT YET I CANNOT FIND MYSELF IN YOUR PRESENCE WITHOUT LONGING TO POUR FORTH MY SOUL AND TELL YOU HOW FONDLY I ADORE YOU
IT OCCURRED TO THE POSSESSOR OF THE PROPERTY THAT A HANDSOME SUM MIGHT BE OBTAINED FOR THE GROUND THEN DEVOTED TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BY BUILDING ALONG THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED STREET AND SO MAKING IT A BRANCH OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE ITSELF
WHERE THE WIDE SPREADING CHESTNUT TREES RAISED THEIR HEADS HIGH ABOVE THE WALLS IN A SOLID RAMPART AND WITH THE COMING OF EVERY SPRING SCATTERED A SHOWER OF DELICATE PINK AND WHITE BLOSSOMS
A FRIEND LOST TO HIM FOREVER AND ON HIS DEATH BED WHEN THE NEAR APPROACH OF ETERNITY SEEMED TO HAVE ILLUMINED HIS MIND WITH SUPERNATURAL LIGHT THIS THOUGHT WHICH HAD UNTIL THEN BEEN BUT A DOUBT BECAME A CONVICTION AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE MAXIMILIAN IT WAS EDMOND DANTES
THAT COMPLETES THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS WE HAD FIXED AS THE LIMITS OF OUR GAINS
WHERE HE RECEIVED HIS FRIENDS HE WAS SUPERINTENDING THE GROOMING OF HIS HORSE AND SMOKING HIS CIGAR AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GARDEN WHEN THE COUNT'S CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE GATE
IT IS NEEDLESS TO ADD THAT THERE WERE GOLD AND SILVER FISH IN THE BASIN THE HOUSE WITH KITCHENS AND CELLARS BELOW HAD ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR TWO STORIES AND ATTICS
OR IN OTHER WORDS PROJECTED A STREET AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN THE STREET WAS LAID OUT A NAME WAS CHOSEN AND POSTED UP ON AN IRON PLATE BUT BEFORE CONSTRUCTION WAS BEGUN
WHO IS ALWAYS TEASING ME ABOUT COMING TO WORK AT MY EMBROIDERY WHICH I AM IN A FAIR WAY NEVER TO GET DONE SO PRAY EXCUSE YOURSELF AS WELL AS YOU CAN FOR HAVING MADE ME WAIT AND AFTER THAT TELL ME WHY I SEE YOU IN A DRESS SO SINGULAR THAT AT FIRST I DID NOT RECOGNIZE YOU
THE HOUSE WAS OF WHITE STONE AND IN A SMALL COURT BEFORE IT WERE TWO SMALL BEDS FULL OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS
AND THE PURCHASER OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAVING PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR IT AND BEING QUITE UNABLE TO FIND ANY ONE WILLING TO TAKE HIS BARGAIN OFF HIS HANDS WITHOUT A CONSIDERABLE LOSS YET STILL CLINGING TO THE BELIEF THAT AT SOME FUTURE DAY HE SHOULD OBTAIN A SUM FOR IT THAT WOULD REPAY HIM
THIS WAS JULIE WHO HAD BECOME AS THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAD PREDICTED MADAME EMMANUEL HERBAULT SHE UTTERED A CRY OF SURPRISE AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER AND MAXIMILIAN BEGAN TO LAUGH
I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE WELL KNOWN IN THE RUE MESLAY YOUR FAMILY APPEARS TO BE A VERY HAPPY ONE SAID THE COUNT AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF OH YES I ASSURE YOU COUNT THEY WANT NOTHING THAT CAN RENDER THEM HAPPY
MONSIEUR RETURNED MAXIMILIAN RAISING THE GLASS COVER AND RESPECTFULLY KISSING THE SILKEN PURSE THIS HAS TOUCHED THE HAND OF A MAN WHO SAVED MY FATHER FROM SUICIDE US FROM RUIN AND OUR NAME FROM SHAME AND DISGRACE A MAN BY WHOSE MATCHLESS BENEVOLENCE WE POOR CHILDREN
AND WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN HAS TAKEN THIS METHOD OF REQUITING THE OBLIGATION EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN THIS AFFAIR EVEN A MIRACLE WHAT WAS HIS NAME ASKED MONTE CRISTO HE GAVE NO OTHER NAME ANSWERED JULIE LOOKING EARNESTLY AT THE COUNT
CLAD IN A BLOUSE AND CAP A FAINT CRY OF MINGLED PLEASURE AND SURPRISE ESCAPED FROM THE LIPS OF VALENTINE WHO ALMOST INSTANTLY SAID IN A SADDENED TONE AS THOUGH SOME ENVIOUS CLOUD DARKENED THE JOY WHICH ILLUMINED HER HEART
THERE IS NOTHING NOW TO PREVENT MY BUILDING MYSELF A LITTLE HUT ON MY PLANTATION AND RESIDING NOT TWENTY YARDS FROM YOU ONLY IMAGINE WHAT HAPPINESS THAT WOULD AFFORD ME I CAN SCARCELY CONTAIN MYSELF AT THE BARE IDEA
WAS ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED IN THE CHOICE BY THE ABSENCE OF ALL GLARE THE COOL REFRESHING SHADE THE SCREEN IT AFFORDED FROM THE SCORCHING RAYS OF THE SUN THAT FOUND NO ENTRANCE THERE EVEN DURING THE BURNING DAYS OF HOTTEST SUMMER
BUT AS HE HAD BUT ONE EYE AND THAT EYE HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT DIM IN THE COURSE OF NINE YEARS
FOR HE HAS DONE FOR US WHAT HE GRANTS ONLY TO HIS CHOSEN HE SENT US ONE OF HIS ANGELS
OH MONSIEUR THIS IS CRUEL OF YOU SAID JULIE MUCH AFFECTED AND THE YOUNG LADY'S EYES SWAM WITH TEARS MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO GRAVELY AND GAZING EARNESTLY ON THE TWO LIQUID PEARLS THAT TRICKLED DOWN JULIE'S CHEEKS
HOW CAN YOU FOR AN INSTANT ENTERTAIN SO UNWORTHY A THOUGHT DEAR VALENTINE HAVE I NOT FROM THE FIRST BLESSED HOUR OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE SCHOOLED ALL MY WORDS AND ACTIONS TO YOUR SENTIMENTS AND IDEAS
HENCEFORTH WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR I AM ON MY OWN GROUND AND HAVE AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO PLACE A LADDER AGAINST THE WALL AND TO LOOK OVER WHEN I PLEASE WITHOUT HAVING ANY APPREHENSIONS OF BEING TAKEN OFF BY THE POLICE AS A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER
AT LEAST I WAS IN YOUR THOUGHTS YOU ASKED ME THE CAUSE OF MY BEING LATE AND WHY I COME DISGUISED I WILL CANDIDLY EXPLAIN THE REASON OF BOTH
MY FATHER THOUGHT THAT THIS ACTION HAD BEEN MIRACULOUSLY PERFORMED HE BELIEVED THAT A BENEFACTOR HAD ARISEN FROM THE GRAVE TO SAVE US OH IT WAS A TOUCHING SUPERSTITION MONSIEUR AND ALTHOUGH I DID NOT MYSELF BELIEVE IT I WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD HAVE DESTROYED MY FATHER'S FAITH
AND IN THE REAR OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPOSING MANSIONS IN THIS RICH NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE VARIOUS HOUSES VIE WITH EACH OTHER FOR ELEGANCE OF DESIGN AND MAGNIFICENCE OF CONSTRUCTION EXTENDED A LARGE GARDEN
AND YOU HAVE I AM SURE THE FULLEST CONFIDENCE IN MY HONOR WHEN YOU SPOKE TO ME OF EXPERIENCING A VAGUE AND INDEFINITE SENSE OF COMING DANGER I PLACED MYSELF BLINDLY AND DEVOTEDLY AT YOUR SERVICE ASKING NO OTHER REWARD THAN THE PLEASURE OF BEING USEFUL TO YOU
FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL ME DID YOU KNOW THIS ENGLISHMAN BUT YOU TELL ME ALSO THAT THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAVE CONSTANTLY DENIED HAVING RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE YES THEN IS IT NOT PROBABLE THAT THIS ENGLISHMAN MAY BE SOME ONE WHO GRATEFUL FOR A KINDNESS YOUR FATHER HAD SHOWN HIM
BUT HE NEVER HAS ANY REGARD FOR HIS POOR SISTER PENELON PENELON AN OLD MAN WHO WAS DIGGING BUSILY AT ONE OF THE BEDS STUCK HIS SPADE IN THE EARTH AND APPROACHED CAP IN HAND STRIVING TO CONCEAL A QUID OF TOBACCO HE HAD JUST THRUST INTO HIS CHEEK
WITH ITS THICKLY PLANTED COURT YARD OPENING INTO THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE AND TO THE GARDEN SHUT IN BY THIS GATE WHICH FORMERLY COMMUNICATED WITH A FINE KITCHEN GARDEN OF ABOUT AN ACRE FOR THE DEMON OF SPECULATION DREW A LINE
AND HAD NOW FALLEN SO COMPLETELY IN GENERAL ESTIMATION AS TO RETURN NOT EVEN THE ONE HALF PER CENT IT HAD ORIGINALLY PAID TOWARDS THE HOUSE THE CHESTNUT TREES WE HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED ROSE HIGH ABOVE THE WALL
A FEW LOCKS OF GRAY MINGLED WITH HIS HAIR WHICH WAS STILL THICK AND MATTED WHILE HIS BRONZED FEATURES AND DETERMINED GLANCE WELL SUITED AN OLD SAILOR WHO HAD BRAVED THE HEAT OF THE EQUATOR AND THE STORMS OF THE TROPICS I THINK YOU HAILED ME
HIS COAT CLOSELY BUTTONED UP AND CONSTANTLY TAKING OUT HIS PENCIL
BUT THE STRICT DECORUM AND RIGID PROPRIETY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE HOUSE LEFT NO GROUNDS FOR APPREHENDING THAT ADVANTAGE WOULD BE TAKEN OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HORTICULTURE SEEMED HOWEVER TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED IN THE DESERTED KITCHEN GARDEN
NO NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO PALE AS DEATH PRESSING ONE HAND ON HIS HEART TO STILL ITS THROBBINGS WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE POINTED TO A CRYSTAL COVER BENEATH WHICH A SILKEN PURSE LAY ON A BLACK VELVET CUSHION
AT THAT INSTANT THE LITTLE SIDE GATE LEADING FROM THE WASTE GROUND TO THE STREET WAS NOISELESSLY OPENED AND A TALL POWERFUL YOUNG MAN APPEARED HE WAS DRESSED IN A COMMON GRAY BLOUSE AND VELVET CAP BUT HIS CAREFULLY ARRANGED HAIR BEARD AND MUSTACHE
FORGETTING THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO RENEW THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD CEASED AFTER THE FIRST SALUTATIONS HAD BEEN EXCHANGED THE SILENCE BECAME ALMOST PAINFUL WHEN BY A VIOLENT EFFORT TEARING HIMSELF FROM HIS PLEASING REVERIE
I HAVE CHOSEN A TRADE A TRADE OH MAXIMILIAN HOW CAN YOU JEST AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE SUCH DEEP CAUSE FOR UNEASINESS HEAVEN KEEP ME FROM JESTING WITH THAT WHICH IS FAR DEARER TO ME THAN LIFE ITSELF
AND DO YOU KNOW THIS GENTLEMAN MONSIEUR INQUIRED EMMANUEL OH IF YOU DO KNOW HIM CRIED JULIE CAN YOU TELL US WHERE HE IS WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM MAXIMILIAN EMMANUEL IF WE DO BUT DISCOVER HIM HE MUST BELIEVE IN THE GRATITUDE OF THE HEART
HE WAS MY FRIEND HE HAD NO SECRETS FROM ME AND IF THIS HAD BEEN SO HE WOULD HAVE CONFIDED IN ME AND HE TOLD YOU NOTHING NOT A WORD NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO SUPPOSE NOTHING AND YET YOU SPOKE OF HIM AT ONCE AH IN SUCH A CASE ONE SUPPOSES
LEFT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN MY SISTER AND MYSELF FOR WE WERE HIS ONLY CHILDREN HER HUSBAND WHO WHEN HE MARRIED HER HAD NO OTHER PATRIMONY THAN HIS NOBLE PROBITY HIS FIRST RATE ABILITY AND HIS SPOTLESS REPUTATION WISHED TO POSSESS AS MUCH AS HIS WIFE
HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE A LARGE VASE OF JAPAN PORCELAIN FILLED WITH FLOWERS THAT LOADED THE AIR WITH THEIR PERFUME STOOD IN THE SALON JULIE SUITABLY DRESSED AND HER HAIR ARRANGED SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS FEAT IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES RECEIVED THE COUNT ON HIS ENTRANCE
IN WHICH HE OFFERS TO PURCHASE THE GOOD WILL OF THE HOUSE TO UNITE WITH HIS OWN FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ADVISE ME WHAT I HAD BETTER DO
MONTE CRISTO FELT TEARS START INTO HIS EYES AND HE AGAIN WALKED HASTILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN SAID MAXIMILIAN IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF HIM TELL US WHAT IT IS ALAS CRIED MONTE CRISTO STRIVING TO REPRESS HIS EMOTION
CONSIDER BY BECOMING A GARDENER I EFFECTUALLY SCREEN OUR MEETINGS FROM ALL SUSPICION OR DANGER I BESEECH OF YOU MAXIMILIAN TO CEASE TRIFLING AND TELL ME WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN SIMPLY
THE WHOLE OF THE PROPERTY CONSISTING OF AN IMMENSE WORKSHOP TWO PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN AND THE GARDEN ITSELF HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY EMMANUEL WHO HAD SEEN AT A GLANCE THAT HE COULD MAKE OF IT A PROFITABLE SPECULATION
MADEMOISELLE JULIE SAID HE PENELON HAD STILL PRESERVED THE HABIT OF CALLING HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER MADEMOISELLE JULIE AND HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE THE NAME TO MADAME HERBAULT
PARDON ME I HAD NO INTENTION OF COMMITTING AN INDISCRETION INDISCRETION OH YOU MAKE US HAPPY BY GIVING US AN EXCUSE FOR EXPATIATING ON THIS SUBJECT IF WE WANTED TO CONCEAL THE NOBLE ACTION THIS PURSE COMMEMORATES WE SHOULD NOT EXPOSE IT THUS TO VIEW
BUT CONTINUED SHE LORD WILMORE HAD A FAMILY OR FRIENDS HE MUST HAVE KNOWN SOME ONE CAN WE NOT OH IT IS USELESS TO INQUIRE RETURNED THE COUNT PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE WAS NOT THE MAN YOU SEEK FOR
CAREFULLY CLOSING AND SECURING IT AFTER HIM PROCEEDED WITH A HURRIED STEP TOWARDS THE BARRIER AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE EXPECTED THOUGH PROBABLY NOT IN SUCH A COSTUME THE YOUNG WOMAN STARTED IN TERROR AND WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A HASTY RETREAT
MONTE CRISTO ROSE AND WITHOUT MAKING ANY ANSWER FOR THE TREMULOUSNESS OF HIS VOICE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIS EMOTION WALKED UP AND DOWN THE APARTMENT WITH A SLOW STEP OUR MAGNIFICENCE MAKES YOU SMILE COUNT SAID MAXIMILIAN WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES
IS IT NOT WORTH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS TO SAVE OUR FATHER'S NAME FROM THE CHANCES OF EVIL FORTUNE AND FAILURE
SAID A FEW HURRIED WORDS TO MADAME HERBAULT AND PRESSING THE HANDS OF EMMANUEL AND MAXIMILIAN MADAME SAID HE I TRUST YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO VISIT YOU OCCASIONALLY I VALUE YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND FEEL GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR WELCOME
SO I HAVE BECOME A GARDENER AND CONSEQUENTLY ADOPTED THE COSTUME OF MY CALLING WHAT EXCESSIVE NONSENSE YOU TALK MAXIMILIAN NONSENSE PRAY DO NOT CALL WHAT I CONSIDER THE WISEST ACTION OF MY LIFE BY SUCH A NAME
AS THEY WAVED THEIR VARIEGATED LEAVES IN THE WIND AND CHARMED THE EYE WITH THEIR SCARLET BLOOM HAD FALLEN INTO UTTER DISUSE THE PROPRIETORS OF THE MANSION HAD MANY YEARS BEFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THE POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE ITSELF
MAXIMILIAN HAD SCARCELY FINISHED HIS STORY DURING WHICH THE COUNT'S HEART HAD SWELLED WITHIN HIM WHEN EMMANUEL ENTERED WEARING A HAT AND COAT HE SALUTED THE COUNT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS AWARE OF THE RANK OF HIS GUEST THEN AFTER HAVING LED MONTE CRISTO AROUND THE LITTLE GARDEN
BUT LISTEN TO ME VALENTINE AND I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT I BECAME WEARY OF RANGING FIELDS AND SCALING WALLS AND SERIOUSLY ALARMED AT THE IDEA SUGGESTED BY YOU THAT IF CAUGHT HOVERING ABOUT HERE YOUR FATHER WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE ME SENT TO PRISON AS A THIEF
I WAS WONDERING WHAT COULD BE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PURSE WITH THE PAPER AT ONE END AND THE LARGE DIAMOND AT THE OTHER COUNT REPLIED MAXIMILIAN WITH AN AIR OF GRAVITY THOSE ARE OUR MOST PRECIOUS FAMILY TREASURES THE STONE SEEMS VERY BRILLIANT ANSWERED THE COUNT
NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO I ONLY GUESSED I KNEW A LORD WILMORE WHO WAS CONSTANTLY DOING ACTIONS OF THIS KIND WITHOUT REVEALING HIMSELF HE WAS AN ECCENTRIC BEING AND DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF GRATITUDE
WHICH WAS FAINTLY DISCERNIBLE THROUGH THE DENSE MASS OF VERDURE THAT PARTIALLY CONCEALED IT THOUGH SITUATED BUT A HUNDRED PACES OFF WHOEVER HAD SELECTED THIS RETIRED PORTION OF THE GROUNDS AS THE BOUNDARY OF A WALK OR AS A PLACE FOR MEDITATION
THOSE BORN TO WEALTH AND WHO HAVE THE MEANS OF GRATIFYING EVERY WISH SAID EMMANUEL KNOW NOT WHAT IS THE REAL HAPPINESS OF LIFE JUST AS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TOSSED ON THE STORMY WATERS OF THE OCEAN ON A FEW FRAIL PLANKS CAN ALONE REALIZE THE BLESSINGS OF FAIR WEATHER
WITHOUT IN ANY WAY AFFECTING THE GROWTH OF OTHER LUXURIANT SHRUBS AND FLOWERS THAT EAGERLY DRESSED FORWARD TO FILL UP THE VACANT SPACES AS THOUGH ASSERTING THEIR RIGHT TO ENJOY THE BOON OF LIGHT AND AIR AT ONE CORNER
FROM PRESUMING TO SULLY THE ARISTOCRATIC ENCLOSURE BELONGING TO THE MANSION THE GATE HAD BEEN BOARDED UP TO A HEIGHT OF SIX FEET TRUE THE PLANKS WERE NOT SO CLOSELY ADJUSTED BUT THAT A HASTY PEEP MIGHT BE OBTAINED THROUGH THEIR INTERSTICES
IT WAS THIS THAT MADE ME START WHEN YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY
I KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND AS YOU WISHED AND WAITED NOT FOR THE DECISION OF YOUR HEART OR MY OWN
HE HAD RESERVED THE HOUSE AND HALF THE GARDEN AND BUILDING A WALL BETWEEN THE GARDEN AND THE WORKSHOPS HAD LET THEM UPON LEASE WITH THE PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN
AND MONSIEUR MAXIMILIAN MORREL WOULD SEE HIS EXCELLENCY THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO CRIED MORREL THROWING AWAY HIS CIGAR AND HASTENING TO THE CARRIAGE I SHOULD THINK WE WOULD SEE HIM AH A THOUSAND THANKS COUNT FOR NOT HAVING FORGOTTEN YOUR PROMISE
COME COME SAID MAXIMILIAN I WILL SERVE AS YOUR GUIDE SUCH A MAN AS YOU ARE OUGHT NOT TO BE INTRODUCED BY A SERVANT MY SISTER IS IN THE GARDEN PLUCKING THE DEAD ROSES MY BROTHER IS READING HIS TWO PAPERS THE PRESSE AND THE DEBATS WITHIN SIX STEPS OF HER
THE CARRIAGES THAT DROVE UP TO THE DOOR WERE COMPELLED TO TURN TO AVOID A FOUNTAIN THAT PLAYED IN A BASIN OF ROCKWORK AN ORNAMENT THAT HAD EXCITED THE JEALOUSY OF THE WHOLE QUARTER
LISTEN TO ME OUR HOUSE TRANSACTS BUSINESS TO THE AMOUNT OF A MILLION A YEAR FROM WHICH WE DERIVE AN INCOME OF FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS
AND THIS DIAMOND WAS GIVEN BY THE GENEROUS UNKNOWN TO MY SISTER AS HER DOWRY MONTE CRISTO OPENED THE LETTER AND READ IT WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE FEELING OF DELIGHT IT WAS THE LETTER WRITTEN AS OUR READERS KNOW TO JULIE AND SIGNED SINBAD THE SAILOR
AND THAT YOUR FATHER WAS RESOLVED UPON COMPLETING THE MATCH
WHICH HAD FOR SOME TIME BEEN INCREASING BECAME ALARMING HE COULD NOT SPEAK
BUT SUCH AS WE ARE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED BITTER SORROWS AND GOD HAS POURED BALM INTO YOUR WOUNDS AS HE DOES INTO THOSE OF ALL WHO ARE IN AFFLICTION SAID MONTE CRISTO INQUIRINGLY YES COUNT RETURNED JULIE WE MAY INDEED SAY HE HAS
INTO THE LARGE STONE VASES THAT STOOD UPON THE TWO SQUARE PILASTERS OF A CURIOUSLY WROUGHT IRON GATE
WITH A TONE SO SWEET AND GENTLE THAT IT WENT TO MAXIMILIAN'S HEART LIKE THE VOICE OF A FATHER BUT THEY WILL NOT BE CONTENT WITH THAT YOUR BROTHER IN LAW IS A BARRISTER A DOCTOR HE WAS A MERCHANT MONSIEUR AND HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE BUSINESS OF MY POOR FATHER
UNKNOWN YOU SAY IS THE MAN WHO RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE UNKNOWN TO YOU YES WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE HAPPINESS OF PRESSING HIS HAND CONTINUED MAXIMILIAN WE HAVE SUPPLICATED HEAVEN IN VAIN TO GRANT US THIS FAVOR
BUT THE WHOLE AFFAIR HAS HAD A MYSTERIOUS MEANING THAT WE CANNOT COMPREHEND WE HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND A HAND AS POWERFUL AS THAT OF AN ENCHANTER OH CRIED JULIE I HAVE NOT LOST ALL HOPE OF SOME DAY KISSING THAT HAND AS I NOW KISS THE PURSE WHICH HE HAS TOUCHED
THAT I CAUSE NO SMALL DISTURBANCE IN YOUR HOUSE LOOK THERE SAID MAXIMILIAN LAUGHING THERE IS HER HUSBAND CHANGING HIS JACKET FOR A COAT
HE LABORED AND TOILED UNTIL HE HAD AMASSED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS SIX YEARS SUFFICED TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECT OH I ASSURE YOU SIR IT WAS A TOUCHING SPECTACLE TO SEE THESE YOUNG CREATURES DESTINED BY THEIR TALENTS FOR HIGHER STATIONS TOILING TOGETHER
BUT THE EYE OF LOVE HAD ALREADY SEEN EVEN THROUGH THE NARROW CHINKS OF THE WOODEN PALISADES THE MOVEMENT OF THE WHITE ROBE AND OBSERVED THE FLUTTERING OF THE BLUE SASH PRESSING HIS LIPS CLOSE TO THE PLANKS HE EXCLAIMED DON'T BE ALARMED VALENTINE IT IS I
OH HEAVEN EXCLAIMED JULIE CLASPING HER HANDS IN WHAT DID HE BELIEVE THEN HE DID NOT CREDIT IT AT THE PERIOD WHICH I KNEW HIM SAID MONTE CRISTO TOUCHED TO THE HEART BY THE ACCENTS OF JULIE'S VOICE BUT PERHAPS SINCE THEN HE HAS HAD PROOFS THAT GRATITUDE DOES EXIST
EVERYTHING IN THIS CHARMING RETREAT FROM THE WARBLE OF THE BIRDS TO THE SMILE OF THE MISTRESS BREATHED TRANQUILLITY AND REPOSE THE COUNT HAD FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THIS HAPPINESS FROM THE MOMENT HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND HE REMAINED SILENT AND PENSIVE
PENELON COUNT IS THE OLD SAILOR YOU SAW IN THE GARDEN AND WHO FROM QUARTERMASTER HAS BECOME GARDENER
RECOLLECT WHAT OUR EXCELLENT FATHER SO OFTEN TOLD US IT WAS NO ENGLISHMAN THAT THUS SAVED US MONTE CRISTO STARTED
AND RECIPROCALLY AS THEY SAY AT THE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL AT THE SOUND OF THEIR STEPS A YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY TO FIVE AND TWENTY DRESSED IN A SILK MORNING GOWN AND BUSILY ENGAGED IN PLUCKING THE DEAD LEAVES OFF A NOISETTE ROSE TREE RAISED HER HEAD
NOT ONLY FOR HIS PAST OUTLAY BUT ALSO THE INTEREST UPON THE CAPITAL LOCKED UP IN HIS NEW ACQUISITION CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH LETTING THE GROUND TEMPORARILY TO SOME MARKET GARDENERS AT A YEARLY RENTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
ALL OF THE RICHEST AND GLOSSIEST BLACK ILL ACCORDED WITH HIS PLEBEIAN ATTIRE AFTER CASTING A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM IN ORDER TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS UNOBSERVED HE ENTERED BY THE SMALL GATE AND
THEY ARE YOUNG AND CHEERFUL THEY ARE TENDERLY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER AND WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR THEY FANCY THEMSELVES AS RICH AS ROTHSCHILD FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS IS NOT A LARGE SUM HOWEVER REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
AGAIN THE TIMID GIRL FOUND COURAGE TO RETURN TO THE GATE SAYING AS SHE DID SO AND WHY DO YOU COME SO LATE TO DAY IT IS ALMOST DINNER TIME AND I HAD TO USE NO LITTLE DIPLOMACY TO GET RID OF MY WATCHFUL MOTHER IN LAW MY TOO DEVOTED MAID AND MY TROUBLESOME BROTHER
BUT I WISHED TO HAVE YOUR ADVICE IS MY COUNSEL
AN ENGLISHMAN SAID MONTE CRISTO WHO GREW UNEASY AT THE ATTENTION WITH WHICH JULIE LOOKED AT HIM AN ENGLISHMAN YOU SAY YES REPLIED MAXIMILIAN AN ENGLISHMAN WHO REPRESENTED HIMSELF AS THE CONFIDENTIAL CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH AT ROME
WHERE THE FOLIAGE BECAME SO THICK AS ALMOST TO SHUT OUT DAY A LARGE STONE BENCH AND SUNDRY RUSTIC SEATS INDICATED THAT THIS SHELTERED SPOT WAS EITHER IN GENERAL FAVOR OR PARTICULAR USE BY SOME INHABITANT OF THE HOUSE
IF LORD WILMORE WAS YOUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR I FEAR YOU WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN I PARTED FROM HIM TWO YEARS AGO AT PALERMO AND HE WAS THEN ON THE POINT OF SETTING OUT FOR THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS SO THAT I FEAR HE WILL NEVER RETURN
DON'T DISTURB YOURSELF JULIE SAID HE THE COUNT HAS ONLY BEEN TWO OR THREE DAYS IN PARIS BUT HE ALREADY KNOWS WHAT A FASHIONABLE WOMAN OF THE MARAIS IS AND IF HE DOES NOT YOU WILL SHOW HIM
ALAS NO MAXIMILIAN THIS MUST NOT BE FOR MANY REASONS WE SHOULD PRESUME TOO MUCH ON OUR OWN STRENGTH AND LIKE OTHERS PERHAPS BE LED ASTRAY BY OUR BLIND CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER'S PRUDENCE
STILL IT APPEARED WITH AGONY TRANSFIXED THUS BY NOT HAVING ANY WAY OR ISSUE AT FIRST FROM OUT THE FIRE TO ITS OWN LANGUAGE CONVERTED WERE THE MELANCHOLY WORDS BUT AFTERWARDS
IF I DESERVED OF YOU OR MUCH OR LITTLE WHEN IN THE WORLD I WROTE THE LOFTY VERSES DO NOT MOVE ON BUT ONE OF YOU DECLARE WHITHER BEING LOST HE WENT AWAY TO DIE THEN OF THE ANTIQUE FLAME THE GREATER HORN MURMURING
WE OF THE OARS MADE WINGS FOR OUR MAD FLIGHT EVERMORE GAINING ON THE LARBOARD SIDE ALREADY ALL THE STARS OF THE OTHER POLE THE NIGHT BEHELD AND OURS SO VERY LOW IT DID NOT RISE ABOVE THE OCEAN FLOOR
AND BEHIND HIM I WENT ALREADY MAKING MY REPLY AND SUPERADDING IN THAT CAVERN WHERE I HELD MINE EYES WITH SUCH ATTENTION FIXED I THINK A SPIRIT OF MY BLOOD LAMENTS THE SIN WHICH DOWN BELOW THERE COSTS SO MUCH THEN SAID THE MASTER
WHERE THOU WAST QUESTIONED OF THE TRUTH AT TROY IF I SPAKE FALSE THOU FALSIFIEDST THE COIN SAID SINON AND FOR ONE FAULT I AM HERE AND THOU FOR MORE THAN ANY OTHER DEMON
BEHOLD IF ANY BE AS GREAT AS THIS AND SO THAT THOU MAY CARRY NEWS OF ME
BEGAN TO WAVE ITSELF ABOUT EVEN AS A FLAME DOTH WHICH THE WIND FATIGUES THEREAFTERWARD THE SUMMIT TO AND FRO MOVING AS IF IT WERE THE TONGUE THAT SPAKE IT UTTERED FORTH A VOICE AND SAID
BENEATH THE GREEN PAWS FINDS ITSELF AGAIN VERRUCCHIO'S ANCIENT MASTIFF AND THE NEW
AND BY THE HAIR IT HELD THE HEAD DISSEVERED HUNG FROM THE HAND IN FASHION OF A LANTERN AND THAT UPON US GAZED AND SAID O ME IT OF ITSELF MADE TO ITSELF A LAMP
NOR IN ME THAT CORD WHICH USED TO MAKE THOSE GIRT WITH IT MORE MEAGRE BUT EVEN AS CONSTANTINE SOUGHT OUT SYLVESTER TO CURE HIS LEPROSY WITHIN SORACTE SO THIS ONE SOUGHT ME OUT AS AN ADEPT
AND THOU INSTRUCT ME HOW TO RAZE PALESTRINA TO THE GROUND HEAVEN HAVE I POWER TO LOCK AND TO UNLOCK AS THOU DOST KNOW THEREFORE THE KEYS ARE TWO THE WHICH MY PREDECESSOR HELD NOT DEAR
WHERE THE MINISTRESS OF THE HIGH LORD JUSTICE INFALLIBLE PUNISHES FORGERS WHICH SHE HERE RECORDS I DO NOT THINK A SADDER SIGHT TO SEE WAS IN AEGINA THE WHOLE PEOPLE SICK
THREE TIMES IT MADE HER WHIRL WITH ALL THE WATERS AT THE FOURTH TIME IT MADE THE STERN UPLIFT AND THE PROW DOWNWARD GO AS PLEASED ANOTHER
AS I GREW AWARE AS SOON AS I WAS WHERE THE DEPTH APPEARED AND SUCH AS HE WHO WITH THE BEARS AVENGED HIM BEHELD ELIJAH'S CHARIOT AT DEPARTING WHAT TIME THE STEEDS TO HEAVEN ERECT UPROSE
THE OTHER UPWARD TURNS O YE WHO WITHOUT ANY TORMENT ARE AND WHY I KNOW NOT IN THE WORLD OF WOE HE SAID TO US BEHOLD AND BE ATTENTIVE UNTO THE MISERY OF MASTER ADAM
HE MUST COME DOWN AMONG MY SERVITORS BECAUSE HE GAVE THE FRAUDULENT ADVICE FROM WHICH TIME FORTH I HAVE BEEN AT HIS HAIR FOR WHO REPENTS NOT CANNOT BE ABSOLVED NOR CAN ONE BOTH REPENT AND WILL AT ONCE
BY REASON THAT OUR WOUNDS ARE CLOSED AGAIN ERE ANY ONE IN FRONT OF HIM REPASS BUT WHO ART THOU THAT MUSEST ON THE CRAG PERCHANCE TO POSTPONE GOING TO THE PAIN THAT IS ADJUDGED UPON THINE ACCUSATIONS
WHEN LIFELESS SHE BEHELD POLYXENA AND OF HER POLYDORUS ON THE SHORE OF OCEAN WAS THE DOLOROUS ONE AWARE OUT OF HER SENSES LIKE A DOG SHE BARKED SO MUCH THE ANGUISH HAD HER MIND DISTORTED
TO PUT THE MORE MY SIGHS IN FLIGHT THERE IS ROMENA WHERE I COUNTERFEITED THE CURRENCY IMPRINTED WITH THE BAPTIST FOR WHICH I LEFT MY BODY BURNED ABOVE
AND NOW DEPARTED FROM US WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE GENTLE POET WHEN YET ANOTHER WHICH BEHIND IT CAME CAUSED US TO TURN OUR EYES UPON ITS TOP BY A CONFUSED SOUND THAT ISSUED FROM IT
WHOLLY TO ME DID THE GOOD MASTER GATHER SAYING SAY UNTO THEM WHATE'ER THOU WISHEST AND I BEGAN SINCE HE WOULD HAVE IT SO SO MAY YOUR MEMORY NOT STEAL AWAY IN THE FIRST WORLD FROM OUT THE MINDS OF MEN
THEREFORE THYSELF DISBURDEN OF ALL SADNESS AND MAKE ACCOUNT THAT I AM AYE BESIDE THEE IF E'ER IT COME TO PASS THAT FORTUNE BRING THEE WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN A LIKE DISPUTE
WHO ENTWINED EIGHT TIMES HIS TAIL ABOUT HIS STUBBORN BACK AND AFTER HE HAD BITTEN IT IN GREAT RAGE SAID OF THE THIEVISH FIRE A CULPRIT THIS
THE PROMISE LONG WITH THE FULFILMENT SHORT WILL MAKE THEE TRIUMPH IN THY LOFTY SEAT FRANCIS CAME AFTERWARD WHEN I WAS DEAD FOR ME BUT ONE OF THE BLACK CHERUBIM SAID TO HIM TAKE HIM NOT DO ME NO WRONG
BUT FOR PURSUIT OF VIRTUE AND OF KNOWLEDGE SO EAGER DID I RENDER MY COMPANIONS WITH THIS BRIEF EXHORTATION FOR THE VOYAGE THAT THEN I HARDLY COULD HAVE HELD THEM BACK AND HAVING TURNED OUR STERN UNTO THE MORNING
AND EVERY FLAME A SINNER STEALS AWAY I STOOD UPON THE BRIDGE UPRISEN TO SEE SO THAT IF I HAD SEIZED NOT ON A ROCK DOWN HAD I FALLEN WITHOUT BEING PUSHED AND THE LEADER WHO BEHELD ME SO ATTENT EXCLAIMED
IF I WERE ONLY STILL SO LIGHT THAT IN A HUNDRED YEARS I COULD ADVANCE ONE INCH I HAD ALREADY STARTED ON THE WAY SEEKING HIM OUT AMONG THIS SQUALID FOLK ALTHOUGH THE CIRCUIT BE ELEVEN MILES AND BE NOT LESS THAN HALF A MILE ACROSS
BY REASON OF OUR SPEECH AND MEMORY THAT HAVE SMALL ROOM TO COMPREHEND SO MUCH IF WERE AGAIN ASSEMBLED ALL THE PEOPLE WHICH FORMERLY UPON THE FATEFUL LAND OF PUGLIA
AFTER THE FIRE A LITTLE MORE HAD ROARED IN ITS OWN FASHION THE SHARP POINT IT MOVED THIS WAY AND THAT AND THEN GAVE FORTH SUCH BREATH
LIVES BETWEEN TYRANNY AND A FREE STATE NOW I ENTREAT THEE TELL US WHO THOU ART BE NOT MORE STUBBORN THAN THE REST HAVE BEEN
I TURNED ME ROUND TOWARDS HIM WITH SUCH SHAME THAT STILL IT EDDIES THROUGH MY MEMORY AND AS HE IS WHO DREAMS OF HIS OWN HARM WHO DREAMING WISHES IT MAY BE A DREAM SO THAT HE CRAVES WHAT IS AS IF IT WERE NOT SUCH I BECAME
AS THE SICILIAN BULL THAT BELLOWED FIRST WITH THE LAMENT OF HIM AND THAT WAS RIGHT WHO WITH HIS FILE HAD MODULATED IT BELLOWED SO WITH THE VOICE OF THE AFFLICTED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS MADE OF BRASS
NOW GO THY WAY NO MORE I URGE THEE BECAUSE I COME PERCHANCE A LITTLE LATE TO STAY AND SPEAK WITH ME LET IT NOT IRK THEE THOU SEEST IT IRKS NOT ME AND I AM BURNING
TO CURE HIM OF THE FEVER OF HIS PRIDE COUNSEL HE ASKED OF ME AND I WAS SILENT BECAUSE HIS WORDS APPEARED INEBRIATE AND THEN HE SAID BE NOT THY HEART AFRAID HENCEFORTH I THEE ABSOLVE
TO BE EXPERIENCED OF THE WORLD AND OF THE VICE AND VIRTUE OF MANKIND BUT I PUT FORTH ON THE HIGH OPEN SEA WITH ONE SOLE SHIP AND THAT SMALL COMPANY BY WHICH I NEVER HAD DESERTED BEEN
WE STEP BY STEP WENT ONWARD WITHOUT SPEECH GAZING UPON AND LISTENING TO THE SICK WHO HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LIFT THEIR BODIES I SAW TWO SITTING LEANED AGAINST EACH OTHER AS LEANS IN HEATING PLATTER AGAINST PLATTER
THE STUMPS UPLIFTING THROUGH THE MURKY AIR SO THAT THE BLOOD MADE HORRIBLE HIS FACE CRIED OUT THOU SHALT REMEMBER MOSCA ALSO WHO SAID ALAS A THING DONE HAS AN END WHICH WAS AN ILL SEED FOR THE TUSCAN PEOPLE
AND MASTER ADAM SMOTE HIM IN THE FACE WITH ARM THAT DID NOT SEEM TO BE LESS HARD SAYING TO HIM ALTHOUGH BE TAKEN FROM ME ALL MOTION FOR MY LIMBS THAT HEAVY ARE I HAVE AN ARM UNFETTERED FOR SUCH NEED WHEREAT HE ANSWER MADE
AS HE WHO GOETH YONDER UNDERTOOK THAT HE MIGHT GAIN THE LADY OF THE HERD TO COUNTERFEIT IN HIMSELF BUOSO DONATI MAKING A WILL AND GIVING IT DUE FORM AND AFTER THE TWO MANIACS HAD PASSED ON WHOM I HELD MINE EYE
IF THOU BUT LATELY INTO THIS BLIND WORLD HAST FALLEN DOWN FROM THAT SWEET LATIAN LAND WHEREFROM I BRING THE WHOLE OF MY TRANSGRESSION SAY IF THE ROMAGNUOLS HAVE PEACE OR WAR
AND RAVING GOES THUS HARRYING OTHER PEOPLE O SAID I TO HIM SO MAY NOT THE OTHER SET TEETH ON THEE LET IT NOT WEARY THEE TO TELL US WHO IT IS ERE IT DART HENCE
AND PENITENT AND CONFESSING I SURRENDERED AH WOE IS ME AND IT WOULD HAVE BESTEAD ME
I HAD WHILE LIVING MUCH OF WHAT I WISHED AND NOW ALAS A DROP OF WATER CRAVE
CONSIDER IF TO COUNT THEM THOU BELIEVEST THAT TWO AND TWENTY MILES THE VALLEY WINDS AND NOW THE MOON IS UNDERNEATH OUR FEET HENCEFORTH THE TIME ALLOTTED US IS BRIEF AND MORE IS TO BE SEEN THAN WHAT THOU SEEST
JOYFUL WERE WE AND SOON IT TURNED TO WEEPING FOR OUT OF THE NEW LAND A WHIRLWIND ROSE AND SMOTE UPON THE FORE PART OF THE SHIP
NEPTUNE NE'ER YET BEHELD SO GREAT A CRIME NEITHER OF PIRATES NOR ARGOLIC PEOPLE THAT TRAITOR WHO SEES ONLY WITH ONE EYE AND HOLDS THE LAND WHICH SOME ONE HERE WITH ME WOULD FAIN BE FASTING FROM THE VISION OF
FOR THEM AM I IN SUCH A FAMILY THEY DID INDUCE ME INTO COINING FLORINS WHICH HAD THREE CARATS OF IMPURITY AND I TO HIM WHO ARE THE TWO POOR WRETCHES THAT SMOKE LIKE UNTO A WET HAND IN WINTER
BUT FOR THE HIGH PRIEST WHOM MAY ILL BETIDE WHO PUT ME BACK INTO MY FORMER SINS AND HOW AND WHEREFORE I WILL HAVE THEE HEAR WHILE I WAS STILL THE FORM OF BONE AND PULP MY MOTHER GAVE TO ME THE DEEDS I DID WERE NOT THOSE OF A LION BUT A FOX
AND TO LICK UP THE MIRROR OF NARCISSUS THOU WOULDST NOT WANT WORDS MANY TO INVITE THEE
SO MAY THY NAILS SUFFICE THEE TO ALL ETERNITY UNTO THIS WORK LATIANS ARE WE WHOM THOU SO WASTED SEEST BOTH OF US HERE ONE WEEPING MADE REPLY BUT WHO ART THOU THAT QUESTIONEST ABOUT US AND SAID THE GUIDE
FOR BRANDA'S FOUNT I WOULD NOT GIVE THE SIGHT ONE IS WITHIN ALREADY IF THE RAVING SHADES THAT ARE GOING ROUND ABOUT SPEAK TRUTH BUT WHAT AVAILS IT ME WHOSE LIMBS ARE TIED
A CASK BY LOSING CENTRE PIECE OR CANT WAS NEVER SHATTERED SO AS I SAW ONE RENT FROM THE CHIN TO WHERE ONE BREAKETH WIND
THAT SO DISPROPORTIONS THE LIMBS WITH HUMOURS WHICH IT ILL CONCOCTS THAT THE FACE CORRESPONDS NOT TO THE BELLY COMPELLED HIM SO TO HOLD HIS LIPS APART AS DOES THE HECTIC WHO BECAUSE OF THIRST ONE TOW'RDS THE CHIN
HAS ME CONDEMNED AND TO THE POET SAID I NOW WAS EVER SO VAIN A PEOPLE AS THE SIENESE NOT FOR A CERTAINTY THE FRENCH BY FAR WHEREAT THE OTHER LEPER WHO HAD HEARD ME REPLIED UNTO MY SPEECH
WHEN WAS THE AIR SO FULL OF PESTILENCE THE ANIMALS DOWN TO THE LITTLE WORM ALL FELL AND AFTERWARDS THE ANCIENT PEOPLE ACCORDING AS THE POETS HAVE AFFIRMED WERE FROM THE SEED OF ANTS RESTORED AGAIN
BUT SO MAY IT SURVIVE NEATH MANY SUNS SAY TO ME WHO YE ARE AND OF WHAT PEOPLE LET NOT YOUR FOUL AND LOATHSOME PUNISHMENT MAKE YOU AFRAID TO SHOW YOURSELVES TO ME
THE SAME WHO GAVE TO THE YOUNG KING THE EVIL COMFORT I MADE THE FATHER AND THE SON REBELLIOUS
TWIXT JULY AND SEPTEMBER AND OF MAREMMA AND SARDINIA ALL THE DISEASES IN ONE MOAT WERE GATHERED SUCH WAS IT HERE AND SUCH A STENCH CAME FROM IT AS FROM PUTRESCENT LIMBS IS WONT TO ISSUE
STILL BE YE UNWILLING TO DENY THE KNOWLEDGE FOLLOWING THE SUN OF THE UNPEOPLED WORLD CONSIDER YE THE SEED FROM WHICH YE SPRANG YE WERE NOT MADE TO LIVE LIKE UNTO BRUTES
AND I TO HIM SHOW TO ME AND DECLARE IF THOU WOULDST HAVE ME BEAR UP NEWS OF THEE WHO IS THIS PERSON OF THE BITTER VISION THEN DID HE LAY HIS HAND UPON THE JAW OF ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS AND HIS MOUTH OPED CRYING
WHEN NOW THE FLAME HAD COME UNTO THAT POINT WHERE TO MY LEADER IT SEEMED TIME AND PLACE AFTER THIS FASHION DID I HEAR HIM SPEAK O YE WHO ARE TWOFOLD WITHIN ONE FIRE IF I DESERVED OF YOU WHILE I WAS LIVING
WHICH NO OTHER SUCCOUR HAD AND THE NAILS DOWNWARD WITH THEM DRAGGED THE SCAB IN FASHION AS A KNIFE THE SCALES OF BREAM OR ANY OTHER FISH THAT HAS THEM LARGEST
AND SAID O THOU WHOM GUILT DOTH NOT CONDEMN AND WHOM I ONCE SAW UP IN LATIAN LAND UNLESS TOO GREAT SIMILITUDE DECEIVE ME
AND NEVER SAW I PLIED A CURRYCOMB BY STABLE BOY FOR WHOM HIS MASTER WAITS OR HIM WHO KEEPS AWAKE UNWILLINGLY AS EVERY ONE WAS PLYING FAST THE BITE OF NAILS UPON HIMSELF FOR THE GREAT RAGE OF ITCHING
AND VESTED THUS IN GOING I BEMOAN ME
OR EVER YET AENEAS NAMED IT SO NOR FONDNESS FOR MY SON NOR REVERENCE FOR MY OLD FATHER NOR THE DUE AFFECTION WHICH JOYOUS SHOULD HAVE MADE PENELOPE COULD OVERCOME WITHIN ME THE DESIRE I HAD
HIS SON BUT UNTO THE LAST BOLGIA OF THE TEN FOR ALCHEMY WHICH IN THE WORLD I PRACTISED
BOTH OF THE SHORES I SAW AS FAR AS SPAIN FAR AS MOROCCO AND THE ISLE OF SARDES AND THE OTHERS WHICH THAT SEA BATHES ROUND ABOUT I AND MY COMPANY WERE OLD AND SLOW
AND I WHO HAD BEFOREHAND MY REPLY IN READINESS FORTHWITH BEGAN TO SPEAK O SOUL THAT DOWN BELOW THERE ART CONCEALED ROMAGNA THINE IS NOT AND NEVER HAS BEEN WITHOUT WAR IN THE BOSOM OF ITS TYRANTS
HAVE GIVEN ME GOOD I MAY MYSELF NOT GRUDGE IT AS MANY AS THE HIND WHO ON THE HILL RESTS AT THE TIME WHEN HE WHO LIGHTS THE WORLD HIS COUNTENANCE KEEPS LEAST CONCEALED FROM US WHILE AS THE FLY GIVES PLACE UNTO THE GNAT
BUT INASMUCH AS NEVER FROM THIS DEPTH DID ANY ONE RETURN IF I HEAR TRUE WITHOUT THE FEAR OF INFAMY I ANSWER I WAS A MAN OF ARMS THEN CORDELIER BELIEVING THUS BEGIRT TO MAKE AMENDS AND TRULY MY BELIEF HAD BEEN FULFILLED
NOT HAVING POWER TO SPEAK FOR TO EXCUSE MYSELF I WISHED AND STILL EXCUSED MYSELF AND DID NOT THINK I DID IT LESS SHAME DOTH WASH AWAY A GREATER FAULT THE MASTER SAID THAN THIS OF THINE HAS BEEN
BUT OPEN WAR I NONE HAVE LEFT THERE NOW RAVENNA STANDS AS IT LONG YEARS HAS STOOD THE EAGLE OF POLENTA THERE IS BROODING SO THAT SHE COVERS CERVIA WITH HER VANS
BITING IN THE MANNER RAN ALONG THAT A BOAR DOES WHEN FROM THE STY TURNED LOOSE ONE TO CAPOCCHIO CAME AND BY THE NAPE SEIZED WITH ITS TEETH HIS NECK
HOW MUTILATED SEE IS MAHOMET IN FRONT OF ME DOTH ALI WEEPING GO CLEFT IN THE FACE FROM FORELOCK UNTO CHIN AND ALL THE OTHERS WHOM THOU HERE BEHOLDEST DISSEMINATORS OF SCANDAL AND OF SCHISM WHILE LIVING WERE
AND ALBERT OF SIENA HAD ME BURNED BUT WHAT I DIED FOR DOES NOT BRING ME HERE TIS TRUE I SAID TO HIM SPEAKING IN JEST THAT I COULD RISE BY FLIGHT INTO THE AIR AND HE WHO HAD CONCEIT BUT LITTLE WIT WOULD HAVE ME SHOW TO HIM THE ART AND ONLY BECAUSE NO DAEDALUS I MADE HIM
THE CITIES OF LAMONE AND SANTERNO GOVERNS THE LIONCEL OF THE WHITE LAIR WHO CHANGES SIDES TWIXT SUMMER TIME AND WINTER AND THAT OF WHICH THE SAVIO BATHES THE FLANK EVEN AS IT LIES BETWEEN THE PLAIN AND MOUNTAIN
BECAUSE I PARTED PERSONS SO UNITED PARTED DO I NOW BEAR MY BRAIN ALAS FROM ITS BEGINNING WHICH IS IN THIS TRUNK
AND NOT WITH SARACENS NOR WITH THE JEWS FOR EACH ONE OF HIS ENEMIES WAS CHRISTIAN AND NONE OF THEM HAD BEEN TO CONQUER ACRE NOR MERCHANDISING IN THE SULTAN'S LAND NOR THE HIGH OFFICE NOR THE SACRED ORDERS IN HIM REGARDED
AND THIS IS TRUE AS THAT I SPEAK TO THEE MORE THAN A HUNDRED WERE THERE WHEN THEY HEARD HIM WHO IN THE MOAT STOOD STILL TO LOOK AT ME THROUGH WONDERMENT OBLIVIOUS OF THEIR TORTURE
AND WHERE HIS WIT THE ABBAGLIATO PROFFERED BUT THAT THOU KNOW WHO THUS DOTH SECOND THEE AGAINST THE SIENESE MAKE SHARP THINE EYE TOW'RDS ME SO THAT MY FACE WELL ANSWER THEE
WOULD THAT IT WERE SEEING IT NEEDS MUST BE FOR TWILL AGGRIEVE ME MORE THE MORE I AGE WE WENT OUR WAY AND UP ALONG THE STAIRS THE BOURNS HAD MADE US TO DESCEND BEFORE
THAN WAS IT TO BEHOLD THROUGH THAT DARK VALLEY THE SPIRITS LANGUISHING IN DIVERS HEAPS THIS ON THE BELLY THAT UPON THE BACK ONE OF THE OTHER LAY AND OTHERS CRAWLING SHIFTED THEMSELVES ALONG THE DISMAL ROAD
WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED WAY UP THROUGH THE POINT GIVING IT THAT VIBRATION THE TONGUE HAD GIVEN THEM IN THEIR PASSAGE OUT WE HEARD IT SAID O THOU AT WHOM I AIM MY VOICE AND WHO BUT NOW WAST SPEAKING LOMBARD SAYING
FIVE TIMES REKINDLED AND AS MANY QUENCHED HAD BEEN THE SPLENDOUR UNDERNEATH THE MOON SINCE WE HAD ENTERED INTO THE DEEP PASS WHEN THERE APPEARED TO US A MOUNTAIN DIM FROM DISTANCE
MY MASTER I REPLIED BY HEARING THEE I AM MORE SURE BUT I SURMISED ALREADY IT MIGHT BE SO AND ALREADY WISHED TO ASK THEE WHO IS WITHIN THAT FIRE WHICH COMES SO CLEFT AT TOP
O BROTHERS WHO AMID A HUNDRED THOUSAND PERILS I SAID HAVE COME UNTO THE WEST TO THIS SO INCONSIDERABLE VIGIL WHICH IS REMAINING OF YOUR SENSES
THEN URGED ME ON HIS WEIGHTY ARGUMENTS THERE WHERE MY SILENCE WAS THE WORST ADVICE AND SAID I FATHER SINCE THOU WASHEST ME OF THAT SIN INTO WHICH I NOW MUST FALL
BECAUSE OF THE CONTRADICTION WHICH CONSENTS NOT O MISERABLE ME HOW I DID SHUDDER WHEN HE SEIZED ON ME SAYING PERADVENTURE THOU DIDST NOT THINK THAT I WAS A LOGICIAN HE BORE ME UNTO MINOS
WHEN IT WAS COME CLOSE TO THE BRIDGE'S FOOT IT LIFTED HIGH ITS ARM WITH ALL THE HEAD TO BRING MORE CLOSELY UNTO US ITS WORDS WHICH WERE BEHOLD NOW THE SORE PENALTY
O HOW BEWILDERED UNTO ME APPEARED WITH TONGUE ASUNDER IN HIS WINDPIPE SLIT CURIO WHO IN SPEAKING WAS SO BOLD AND ONE WHO BOTH HIS HANDS DISSEVERED HAD
DIVERS LAMENTINGS PIERCED ME THROUGH AND THROUGH WHICH WITH COMPASSION HAD THEIR ARROWS BARBED WHEREAT MINE EARS I COVERED WITH MY HANDS WHAT PAIN WOULD BE IF FROM THE HOSPITALS OF VALDICHIANA
WITH THE OTHER BURTHEN DROWNED HERSELF AND AT THE TIME WHEN FORTUNE DOWNWARD HURLED THE TROJAN'S ARROGANCE THAT ALL THINGS DARED SO THAT THE KING WAS WITH HIS KINGDOM CRUSHED HECUBA SAD DISCONSOLATE AND CAPTIVE
REMOUNTED MY CONDUCTOR AND DREW ME AND FOLLOWING THE SOLITARY PATH AMONG THE ROCKS AND RIDGES OF THE CRAG THE FOOT WITHOUT THE HAND SPED NOT AT ALL THEN SORROWED I
WERE LAMENTING FOR THEIR BLOOD SHED BY THE ROMANS AND THE LINGERING WAR THAT OF THE RINGS MADE SUCH ILLUSTRIOUS SPOILS AS LIVY HAS RECORDED WHO ERRS NOT
AND THEREFORE ARE CLEFT THUS A DEVIL IS BEHIND HERE WHO DOTH CLEAVE US THUS CRUELLY
WHENCE HE ACCUMULATING WOE ON WOE DEPARTED LIKE A PERSON SAD AND CRAZED BUT I REMAINED TO LOOK UPON THE CROWD AND SAW A THING WHICH I SHOULD BE AFRAID WITHOUT SOME FURTHER PROOF EVEN TO RECOUNT
ONE AM I WHO DESCENDS DOWN WITH THIS LIVING MAN FROM CLIFF TO CLIFF AND I INTEND TO SHOW HELL UNTO HIM THEN BROKEN WAS THEIR MUTUAL SUPPORT AND TREMBLING EACH ONE TURNED HIMSELF TO ME WITH OTHERS WHO HAD HEARD HIM BY REBOUND
THUS DID WE SPEAK AS FAR AS THE FIRST PLACE UPON THE CRAG WHICH THE NEXT VALLEY SHOWS DOWN TO THE BOTTOM IF THERE WERE MORE LIGHT WHEN WE WERE NOW RIGHT OVER THE LAST CLOISTER OF MALEBOLGE SO THAT ITS LAY BROTHERS COULD MANIFEST THEMSELVES UNTO OUR SIGHT
AND ALL THE REST WHOSE BONES ARE GATHERED STILL AT CEPERANO WHERE A RENEGADE WAS EACH APULIAN AND AT TAGLIACOZZO WHERE WITHOUT ARMS THE OLD ALARDO CONQUERED AND ONE HIS LIMB TRANSPIERCED AND ONE LOPPED OFF
SPREAD OUT THE NETS THAT I MAY TAKE THE LIONESS AND HER WHELPS UPON THE PASSAGE AND THEN EXTENDED HIS UNPITYING CLAWS SEIZING THE FIRST WHO HAD THE NAME LEARCHUS AND WHIRLED HIM ROUND AND DASHED HIM ON A ROCK AND SHE
AGAINST THE THEBAN BLOOD AS SHE ALREADY MORE THAN ONCE HAD SHOWN SO REFT OF REASON ATHAMAS BECAME THAT SEEING HIS OWN WIFE WITH CHILDREN TWAIN WALKING ENCUMBERED UPON EITHER HAND HE CRIED
AND THEY WERE TWO IN ONE AND ONE IN TWO
THIS IS HE AND HE SPEAKS NOT THIS ONE BEING BANISHED EVERY DOUBT SUBMERGED IN CAESAR BY AFFIRMING THE FOREARMED ALWAYS WITH DETRIMENT ALLOWED DELAY
IF THOU HADST I MADE ANSWER THEREUPON ATTENDED TO THE CAUSE FOR WHICH I LOOKED PERHAPS A LONGER STAY THOU WOULDST HAVE PARDONED MEANWHILE MY GUIDE DEPARTED
HIS HEART WAS VISIBLE AND THE DISMAL SACK THAT MAKETH EXCREMENT OF WHAT IS EATEN WHILE I WAS ALL ABSORBED IN SEEING HIM HE LOOKED AT ME AND OPENED WITH HIS HANDS HIS BOSOM SAYING
AND HE TO ME THAT IS THE ANCIENT GHOST OF THE NEFARIOUS MYRRHA WHO BECAME BEYOND ALL RIGHTFUL LOVE HER FATHER'S LOVER SHE CAME TO SIN WITH HIM AFTER THIS MANNER BY COUNTERFEITING OF ANOTHER'S FORM
AND THOU SHALT SEE I AM CAPOCCHIO'S SHADE WHO METALS FALSIFIED BY ALCHEMY THOU MUST REMEMBER IF I WELL DESCRY THEE
THAT THEY WERE WISHFUL TO STAND STILL AND WEEP BUT SAID VIRGILIUS WHAT DOST THOU STILL GAZE AT
LEAVE ME TO SPEAK BECAUSE I HAVE CONCEIVED THAT WHICH THOU WISHEST FOR THEY MIGHT DISDAIN PERCHANCE SINCE THEY WERE GREEKS DISCOURSE OF THINE
AMONG THE THIEVES FIVE CITIZENS OF THINE LIKE THESE I FOUND WHENCE SHAME COMES UNTO ME AND THOU THEREBY TO NO GREAT HONOUR RISEST BUT IF WHEN MORN IS NEAR OUR DREAMS ARE TRUE
AND THREATENING WITH HIS FINGER FIERCELY AND HEARD HIM CALLED GERI DEL BELLO SO WHOLLY AT THAT TIME WAST THOU IMPEDED BY HIM WHO FORMERLY HELD ALTAFORTE THOU DIDST NOT LOOK THAT WAY
I TURNED IT BACK TO LOOK UPON THE OTHER EVIL BORN I SAW ONE MADE IN FASHION OF A LUTE IF HE HAD ONLY HAD THE GROIN CUT OFF JUST AT THE POINT AT WHICH A MAN IS FORKED THE HEAVY DROPSY
EVER BEFORE ME STAND AND NOT IN VAIN FOR FAR MORE DOTH THEIR IMAGE DRY ME UP THAN THE DISEASE WHICH STRIPS MY FACE OF FLESH THE RIGID JUSTICE THAT CHASTISES ME DRAWETH OCCASION FROM THE PLACE IN WHICH I SINNED
LYING THERE CLOSE UPON THY RIGHT HAND CONFINES I FOUND THEM HERE REPLIED HE WHEN I RAINED INTO THIS CHASM AND SINCE THEY HAVE NOT TURNED NOR DO I THINK THEY WILL FOR EVERMORE ONE THE FALSE WOMAN IS WHO ACCUSED JOSEPH
AND PAIN FOR THE PALLADIUM THERE IS BORNE IF THEY WITHIN THOSE SPARKS POSSESS THE POWER TO SPEAK I SAID THEE MASTER MUCH I PRAY AND RE PRAY THAT THE PRAYER BE WORTH A THOUSAND
FOR I WAS FROM THE MOUNTAINS THERE BETWEEN URBINO AND THE YOKE WHENCE TIBER BURSTS I STILL WAS DOWNWARD BENT AND LISTENING WHEN MY CONDUCTOR TOUCHED ME ON THE SIDE SAYING SPEAK THOU
HAD DUG ANOTHER HOLE AND DEPOSITED IT THERE BUT I COULD FIND NOTHING THEN THE IDEA STRUCK ME THAT HE HAD NOT TAKEN THESE PRECAUTIONS AND HAD SIMPLY THROWN IT IN A CORNER IN THE LAST CASE I MUST WAIT FOR DAYLIGHT TO RENEW MY SEARCH I REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND WAITED
THE MEANS WE MIGHT HAVE USED WHICH WE IN OUR BLINDNESS COULD NOT SEE THEN SEEM SIMPLE AND EASY AND WE SAY WHY DID I NOT DO THIS INSTEAD OF THAT WOMEN ON THE CONTRARY ARE RARELY TORMENTED WITH REMORSE
OUTSIDE THIS DOOR A SPADE WAS PLACED AGAINST THE WALL I TOOK IT AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE THICKET I HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A DARK LANTERN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAWN I STOPPED TO LIGHT IT THEN I CONTINUED MY PATH
IF SHE KNEW HOW TO CHOOSE A WIFE AND ALSO WHAT SORT OF CATTLE TO BUY AND SHE SAID THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER HUSBAND HAD NOT TOLD HER THIS SO THE YOUTH SAID THAT HE WOULD GO TO SINGH CHANDO AND ASK
FIXING HIS EYES MORE STEADFASTLY ON HER THAN HE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE DID YOU EVER REVEAL TO ANY ONE OUR CONNECTION NEVER TO ANY ONE YOU UNDERSTAND ME REPLIED VILLEFORT AFFECTIONATELY WHEN I SAY ANY ONE PARDON MY URGENCY
IF MY HEART BE PETRIFIED IT IS THAT IT MIGHT SUSTAIN THE BLOWS IT HAS RECEIVED I WAS NOT SO IN MY YOUTH I WAS NOT SO ON THE NIGHT OF THE BETROTHAL
WE KNOW OF NO GOLD COINS WHERE ARE YOUR WITNESSES YOU MUST HAVE HAD WITNESSES IN SUCH A BUSINESS AND THEY DROVE HER OUT SHE WENT AWAY CRYING AND CALLED THE VILLAGERS TOGETHER AND ASKED THEM TO DECIDE THE MATTER SO THEY QUESTIONED HER AND THE HEADMAN
THENCE I PASSED ON TO THE RHONE WHENCE I DESCENDED MERELY WITH THE CURRENT TO ARLES AT ARLES I WAS AGAIN PLACED ON MY LITTER AND CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TO MARSEILLES MY RECOVERY LASTED SIX MONTHS I NEVER HEARD YOU MENTIONED
THE WORLD EXCUSES AND NOTORIETY ENNOBLES YOU MADAME REPLIED VILLEFORT YOU KNOW THAT I AM NO HYPOCRITE OR AT LEAST THAT I NEVER DECEIVE WITHOUT A REASON IF MY BROW BE SEVERE IT IS BECAUSE MANY MISFORTUNES HAVE CLOUDED IT
THE MAGISTRATE WAS SEATED IN AN ARM CHAIR WRITING WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THE DOOR HE DID NOT MOVE AS HE HEARD IT OPEN AND THE DOOR KEEPER PRONOUNCE THE WORDS WALK IN MADAME AND THEN RECLOSE IT
BUT AS IT WAS WORD AGAINST WORD THEY COULD COME TO NO DECISION SO THEY SETTLED TO PUT THE PARTIES ON OATH BUT THE HEADMAN AND THE WOMAN BOTH SWORE THAT THEY HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH SAYING MAY WE DIE IF WE HAVE SPOKEN FALSELY
OH IT REQUIRES ALL MY REASON TO CONVINCE ME THAT I AM NOT A VERY GUILTY WOMAN AND YOU A MENACING JUDGE
WOULD HE NOT ONE DAY MAKE YOU PAY FOR KEEPING THIS TERRIBLE SECRET WOULD IT NOT BE A SWEET REVENGE FOR HIM WHEN HE FOUND THAT I HAD NOT DIED FROM THE BLOW OF HIS DAGGER IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE AND AT ALL RISKS
POOR THING SAID VILLEFORT PRESSING HER HAND IT WAS TOO SEVERE FOR YOUR STRENGTH FOR YOU WERE TWICE OVERWHELMED AND YET WELL WELL I MUST TELL YOU COLLECT ALL YOUR COURAGE FOR YOU HAVE NOT YET HEARD ALL
IT IS TRUE THAT EVERY STEP IN OUR LIVES IS LIKE THE COURSE OF AN INSECT ON THE SANDS IT LEAVES ITS TRACK ALAS TO MANY THE PATH IS TRACED BY TEARS SIR SAID MADAME DANGLARS
THAT I SHOULD CAUSE ALL TRACES OF THE PAST TO DISAPPEAR THAT I SHOULD DESTROY EVERY MATERIAL VESTIGE TOO MUCH REALITY WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN IN MY RECOLLECTION IT WAS FOR THIS I HAD ANNULLED THE LEASE IT WAS FOR THIS I HAD COME IT WAS FOR THIS I WAS WAITING
BUT NO SOONER HAD THE MAN'S FOOTSTEPS CEASED THAN HE STARTED UP DREW THE BOLTS CLOSED THE CURTAINS AND EXAMINED EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM THEN WHEN HE HAD ASSURED HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY RELIEVED OF DOUBTS HE SAID
DOUBTLESS IT IS CHANCE CHANCE
THEN THE YOUTH ASKED ABOUT THE TWO MEN HE HAD MET SINGH CHANDO SAID TELL THE FIRST MAN WHEN HE IS PLOUGHING TO PLOUGH TWO OR THREE FURROWS BEYOND THE BOUNDARY OF HIS FIELD AND HIS WEALTH WILL DIMINISH
AT THE OFFICE OF THE KING'S ATTORNEY LET US LEAVE THE BANKER DRIVING HIS HORSES AT THEIR FULLEST SPEED
OH HEAVENS WHEN DAYLIGHT DAWNED I WENT DOWN AGAIN MY FIRST VISIT WAS TO THE THICKET I HOPED TO FIND SOME TRACES WHICH HAD ESCAPED ME IN THE DARKNESS
OH THE WICKEDNESS OF MAN IS VERY GREAT SAID VILLEFORT SINCE IT SURPASSES THE GOODNESS OF GOD DID YOU OBSERVE THAT MAN'S EYES WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING TO US NO BUT HAVE YOU EVER WATCHED HIM CAREFULLY
WHEN YOU BUY A BULLOCK FIRST PUT YOUR HAND ON ITS QUARTER AND IF IT SHRINKS AND TRIES TO GET FREE BUY IT AND WHEN YOU WANT A WIFE ENQUIRE FIRST AS TO THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER GOOD PARENTS MAKE GOOD CHILDREN
SHE WAS VERY PLAINLY DRESSED AS WOULD BE THE CASE WITH A WOMAN OF TASTE WALKING IN THE MORNING
IF I PLOUGH OVER THE BOUNDARY ON TO MY NEIGHBOUR'S LAND IT WILL BE A GREAT SIN AND I SHALL SOON BECOME POOR AND HE WENT TO HIS PLOUGHMEN AND TOLD THEM NEVER TO PLOUGH RIGHT UP TO THE EDGE OF THE FIELD BUT TO LEAVE TWO OF THREE FURROWS SPACE
WHAT IS THERE MORE TO HEAR YOU ONLY LOOK BACK TO THE PAST AND IT IS INDEED BAD ENOUGH WELL PICTURE TO YOURSELF A FUTURE MORE GLOOMY STILL CERTAINLY FRIGHTFUL PERHAPS SANGUINARY
THINK NOT I CONTENTED MYSELF WITH THIS ONE EFFORT CONTINUED VILLEFORT NO I SEARCHED THE WHOLE THICKET I THOUGHT THE ASSASSIN HAVING DISCOVERED THE CHEST AND SUPPOSING IT TO BE A TREASURE HAD INTENDED CARRYING IT OFF BUT PERCEIVING HIS ERROR
WHAT THE CORSICAN COULD HAVE DONE WITH THE CHILD A CHILD ENCUMBERS A FUGITIVE PERHAPS ON PERCEIVING IT WAS STILL ALIVE HE HAD THROWN IT INTO THE RIVER
DIGGING UNDERNEATH THESE TREES FOUND NEITHER SKELETON NOR CHEST BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM WAS THERE NEITHER OF THEM THERE
NEVERTHELESS SIR YOU SEE I HAVE ANSWERED YOUR FIRST APPEAL ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY THE CONVERSATION MUST BE MUCH MORE PAINFUL FOR ME THAN FOR YOU
THAT HER WHITE COMPLEXION AND BRILLIANT EYES WERE ALONE VISIBLE THE CAB CROSSED THE PONT NEUF AND ENTERED THE RUE DE HARLAY BY THE PLACE DAUPHINE THE DRIVER WAS PAID AS THE DOOR OPENED
VILLEFORT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS DO I KNOW SAID HE AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF I KNEW
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE PATH WHICH LED TO THE LITTLE GATE BUT THIS EXAMINATION WAS AS USELESS AS THE FIRST AND WITH A BURSTING HEART I RETURNED TO THE THICKET WHICH NOW CONTAINED NO HOPE FOR ME OH CRIED MADAME DANGLARS
IF I DRIVE AWAY THREE OR FOUR HEAD OF CATTLE EVERY DAY I SHALL SOON BECOME POOR SO FROM THAT TIME HE LOOKED OUT FOR ANY STRAYING CATTLE AND WOULD DRIVE THEM HOME WITH HIS OWN IF THE OWNER CLAIMED THEM HE GAVE THEM UP
THANKS MADAME THANKS FOR YOUR PUNCTUALITY AND HE OFFERED A CHAIR TO MADAME DANGLARS WHICH SHE ACCEPTED FOR HER HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE FELT NEARLY SUFFOCATED IT IS A LONG TIME MADAME SAID THE PROCUREUR
DOUBTLESS HE IS CAPRICIOUS BUT THAT IS ALL ONE THING ALONE STRUCK ME OF ALL THE EXQUISITE THINGS HE PLACED BEFORE US HE TOUCHED NOTHING I MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED HE WAS POISONING US AND YOU SEE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED
AND THEN FLUNG IT DOWN IN HASTE SCARCELY HAD I COVERED IT WITH EARTH WHEN THE ARM OF THE CORSICAN WAS STRETCHED TOWARDS ME I SAW A SHADOW RISE AND AT THE SAME TIME A FLASH OF LIGHT I FELT PAIN
NO NO MADAME THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CHANCE OH YES HAS NOT A FATAL CHANCE REVEALED ALL THIS WAS IT NOT BY CHANCE THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO BOUGHT THAT HOUSE WAS IT NOT BY CHANCE HE CAUSED THE EARTH TO BE DUG UP
THE HOUR THEN FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN WAITING DURING THE LAST YEAR HAD AT LENGTH ARRIVED HOW I WORKED HOW I HOPED HOW I STRUCK EVERY PIECE OF TURF THINKING TO FIND SOME RESISTANCE TO MY SPADE BUT NO I FOUND NOTHING
THOUGH WE SCARCELY EXPECTED IT OUR SECRET REMAINED IN OUR OWN KEEPING ALONE I WAS TAKEN TO VERSAILLES FOR THREE MONTHS I STRUGGLED WITH DEATH AT LAST AS I SEEMED TO CLING TO LIFE I WAS ORDERED TO THE SOUTH
I RAN TO THE HOSPITAL AND LEARNED THAT THE SAME NIGHT THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER A CHILD HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE WRAPPED IN PART OF A FINE LINEN NAPKIN PURPOSELY TORN IN HALF THIS PORTION OF THE NAPKIN WAS MARKED WITH HALF A BARON'S CROWN
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND DIED WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT AND SHE WAS VERY UNHAPPY
HOW IS IT THAT IT HAS ESCAPED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE TOMB AND THE RECESSES OF OUR HEARTS WHERE IT WAS BURIED TO VISIT US NOW LIKE A PHANTOM WHITENING OUR CHEEKS AND FLUSHING OUR BROWS WITH SHAME ALAS SAID HERMINE
THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN CALLING UPON HER LAWYER
WHEN YOU WERE HALF EXPIRING ON THAT BED IN THE RED DAMASK ROOM WHILE I SCARCELY LESS AGITATED THAN YOU AWAITED YOUR DELIVERY THE CHILD WAS BORN WAS GIVEN TO ME MOTIONLESS BREATHLESS VOICELESS WE THOUGHT IT DEAD
AND DIRECTED THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE RUE DE HARLAY AS SOON AS SHE WAS SEATED IN THE VEHICLE SHE DREW FROM HER POCKET A VERY THICK BLACK VEIL WHICH SHE TIED ON TO HER STRAW BONNET SHE THEN REPLACED THE BONNET AND SAW WITH PLEASURE IN A LITTLE POCKET MIRROR
IT INDICATED THAT HIS POWERFUL MIND WAS ON THE VERGE OF DESPAIR AND MADNESS AH MY CHILD MY POOR CHILD CRIED THE BARONESS FALLING ON HER CHAIR AND STIFLING HER SOBS IN HER HANDKERCHIEF VILLEFORT BECOMING SOMEWHAT REASSURED
VILLEFORT'S ONLY ANSWER WAS A STIFLED GROAN BUT THE CHILD THE CHILD SIR REPEATED THE AGITATED MOTHER HOW I HAVE SEARCHED FOR HIM REPLIED VILLEFORT WRINGING HIS HANDS HOW I HAVE CALLED HIM IN MY LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHTS
BUT LISTEN TO ME LISTEN AND YOU WILL PITY ME WHO HAS FOR TWENTY YEARS ALONE BORNE THE HEAVY BURDEN OF GRIEF I AM ABOUT TO REVEAL WITHOUT CASTING THE LEAST PORTION UPON YOU OH YOU FRIGHTEN ME BUT SPEAK I WILL LISTEN YOU RECOLLECT THAT SAD NIGHT
A MAN MAY MURDER ANOTHER OUT OF REVENGE BUT HE WOULD NOT DELIBERATELY DROWN A CHILD PERHAPS CONTINUED VILLEFORT HE HAD PUT IT IN THE FOUNDLING HOSPITAL OH YES YES CRIED THE BARONESS MY CHILD IS THERE
AND THERE THEY LOST HER THEY LOST HER YES FOREVER MADAME DANGLARS HAD LISTENED TO THIS RECITAL WITH A SIGH A TEAR OR A SHRIEK FOR EVERY DETAIL AND THIS IS ALL SAID SHE AND YOU STOPPED THERE
A COLD SHARP WIND WHISTLED THROUGH THE LEAFLESS BRANCHES AND YET THE DROPS FELL FROM MY FOREHEAD I RECOLLECTED THAT I WAS STABBED JUST AS I WAS TRAMPLING THE GROUND TO FILL UP THE HOLE WHILE DOING SO I HAD LEANED AGAINST A LABURNUM
YES DOUBTLESS BUT BELIEVE ME THAT MAN HAS OTHER PROJECTS FOR THAT REASON I WISHED TO SEE YOU TO SPEAK TO YOU TO WARN YOU AGAINST EVERY ONE BUT ESPECIALLY AGAINST HIM TELL ME CRIED VILLEFORT
IT IS TRUE THEN HE SAID RATHER UTTERING HIS THOUGHTS ALOUD THAN ADDRESSING HIS COMPANION IT IS TRUE THEN
MY CHILD WAS ALIVE SAID SHE YOU BURIED MY CHILD ALIVE
AND I DID NOT DARE INQUIRE FOR YOU WHEN I RETURNED TO PARIS I LEARNED THAT YOU
I HAD TURNED UP THE EARTH OVER A SURFACE OF MORE THAN TWENTY FEET SQUARE AND A DEPTH OF TWO FEET A LABORER WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IN A DAY WHAT OCCUPIED ME AN HOUR BUT I COULD FIND NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THEN I RENEWED THE SEARCH SUPPOSING IT HAD BEEN THROWN ASIDE
IT IS GENERALLY THE CASE THAT WHAT WE MOST ARDENTLY DESIRE IS AS ARDENTLY WITHHELD FROM US BY THOSE WHO WISH TO OBTAIN IT OR FROM WHOM WE ATTEMPT TO SNATCH IT THUS THE GREATER NUMBER OF A MAN'S ERRORS
THOUGH I HAD MADE A HOLE TWICE AS LARGE AS THE FIRST I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN DECEIVED HAD MISTAKEN THE SPOT I TURNED AROUND I LOOKED AT THE TREES I TRIED TO RECALL THE DETAILS WHICH HAD STRUCK ME AT THE TIME
AND TELL THE SECOND MAN TO DRIVE AWAY THREE OR FOUR OF HIS CATTLE EVERY DAY AND THEIR NUMBER WILL DECREASE SO THE YOUTH RETURNED AND MET THE MAN WHO HAD TOO MANY CATTLE AND TOLD HIM WHAT CHANDO HAD SAID AND THE MAN THOUGHT
AND THEY OBEYED AND FROM THAT TIME HE GREW RICHER THAN EVER AND THE YOUTH RETURNED TO HIS MOTHER AND TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND THEY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE ADVICE WHICH CHANDO HAD GIVEN TO THE TWO MEN AND ACTED ACCORDINGLY
AND HE PROMISED AND WENT ON AND CAME TO SINGH CHANDO AND THERE HE ASKED HOW TO CHOOSE A WIFE AND HOW TO BUY CATTLE AND SINGH CHANDO SAID
NOTHING WAS FOUND BENEATH THE FLOWERS THERE WAS NO CHILD DISINTERRED NO YOU MUST NOT WEEP NO YOU MUST NOT GROAN YOU MUST TREMBLE WHAT CAN YOU MEAN ASKED MADAME DANGLARS SHUDDERING
I SEEMED EVERYWHERE TO HEAR YOUR MOANS BEHIND ME IN THE BED AND I DARED NOT TURN AROUND MY HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT I FEARED MY WOUND WOULD OPEN AT LENGTH ONE BY ONE
IS IT NOT BY CHANCE THAT THE UNFORTUNATE CHILD WAS DISINTERRED UNDER THE TREES THAT POOR INNOCENT OFFSPRING OF MINE WHICH I NEVER EVEN KISSED BUT FOR WHOM I WEPT MANY MANY TEARS
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL GOING ON THAT MORNING AND MANY BUSINESS LIKE PERSONS AT THE PALAIS BUSINESS LIKE PERSONS PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO WOMEN
AND THE LETTER H TRULY TRULY SAID MADAME DANGLARS ALL MY LINEN IS MARKED THUS MONSIEUR DE NARGONNE WAS A BARONET AND MY NAME IS HERMINE THANK GOD MY CHILD WAS NOT THEN DEAD NO IT WAS NOT DEAD
BUT IF NO CLAIMANT APPEARED HE KEPT THEM AND SO HE BECAME RICHER THAN EVER AND THE YOUTH WENT ON AND MET THE MAN WHO WAS TOO RICH AND WHEN HE HEARD WHAT CHANDO HAD SAID HE THOUGHT
I STOOD IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AND THREW MYSELF DOWN I ROSE AND AGAIN BEGAN DIGGING AND ENLARGING THE HOLE STILL I FOUND NOTHING NOTHING THE CHEST WAS NO LONGER THERE THE CHEST NO LONGER THERE MURMURED MADAME DANGLARS CHOKING WITH FEAR
FOR THE DECISION DOES NOT COME FROM YOU YOUR MISFORTUNES ARE GENERALLY IMPOSED UPON YOU AND YOUR FAULTS THE RESULTS OF OTHERS CRIMES IN ANY CASE SIR YOU WILL ALLOW REPLIED MADAME DANGLARS
AND WHY HE SPEAKS IN OUR PRESENCE OF CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN DISINTERRED IN A GARDEN VILLEFORT PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS WITH AN ACCENT WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THE COUNT SHUDDER HAD HE HEARD HIM THEN HE PRESSED THE HAND THE BARONESS RELUCTANTLY GAVE HIM AND LED HER RESPECTFULLY BACK TO THE DOOR
THE VILLAGERS WERE VERY SORRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT THE HEADMAN AND HIS WIFE ABUSED THEM FOR NOT HAVING BELIEVED THEIR WORD THE WOMAN HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR BEFORE SHE MET A STRANGER WHO ASKED WHY SHE WAS CRYING AND WHEN SHE TOLD HIM HE SAID
THEN THE VILLAGERS MADE THEM SWEAR BY THEIR CHILDREN AND THE WOMAN AND THE HEADMAN LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE HEADS OF THEIR SONS AND SWORE AND WHEN THE WOMAN SWORE HER SON FELL DOWN DEAD AND SHE TOOK UP THE DEAD BODY IN HER ARMS AND RAN AWAY WITH IT
SHE WAS LEFT WELL OFF AND AMONG HER PROPERTY WERE THREE GOLD COINS AND AS SHE WAS AFRAID OF THESE BEING STOLEN SHE DECIDED TO PLACE THEM IN THE CARE OF THE VILLAGE HEADMAN SO SHE TOOK THEM TO HIM AND ASKED HIM TO KEEP THEM TILL HER CHILD WAS BORN
TO ANY ONE LIVING I MEAN YES YES I UNDERSTAND VERY WELL EJACULATED THE BARONESS NEVER I SWEAR TO YOU WERE YOU EVER IN THE HABIT OF WRITING IN THE EVENING WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED IN THE MORNING DO YOU KEEP A JOURNAL
BUT YOU SAID REPLIED MADAME DANGLARS HE WOULD REQUIRE IT AS A PROOF AH NO MADAME THAT COULD NOT BE DEAD BODIES ARE NOT KEPT A YEAR THEY ARE SHOWN TO A MAGISTRATE AND THE EVIDENCE IS TAKEN NOW NOTHING OF THE KIND HAS HAPPENED
AS THOUGH SHE WOULD SPRING FROM HER CHAIR BUT VILLEFORT STOPPED AND CLASPED HIS HANDS AS IF TO IMPLORE HER ATTENTION WE THOUGHT IT DEAD HE REPEATED I PLACED IT IN THE CHEST WHICH WAS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF A COFFIN I DESCENDED TO THE GARDEN I DUG A HOLE
THE GRASS HAD GROWN VERY THICKLY THERE DURING THE SUMMER AND WHEN AUTUMN ARRIVED NO ONE HAD BEEN THERE TO MOW IT STILL ONE PLACE WHERE THE GRASS WAS THIN ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION IT EVIDENTLY WAS THERE I HAD TURNED UP THE GROUND I WENT TO WORK
ALAS NO I KNOW NOT A WOMAN ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER CAME TO CLAIM IT WITH THE OTHER HALF OF THE NAPKIN THIS WOMAN GAVE ALL THE REQUISITE PARTICULARS AND IT WAS INTRUSTED TO HER BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE INQUIRED FOR THE WOMAN YOU SHOULD HAVE TRACED HER
WALKING SIX LEAGUES A DAY MADAME DE VILLEFORT FOLLOWED THE LITTER IN HER CARRIAGE
ALWAYS THE SAME ALWAYS THE CHILD'S CORPSE COMING EVERY NIGHT IN MY DREAMS RISING FROM THE EARTH AND HOVERING OVER THE GRAVE WITH MENACING LOOK AND GESTURE I INQUIRED IMMEDIATELY ON MY RETURN TO PARIS THE HOUSE HAD NOT BEEN INHABITED SINCE WE LEFT IT
THE PATHS OF WHICH YOU WERE JUST SPEAKING HAVE BEEN TRACED BY ALL YOUNG MEN OF ARDENT IMAGINATIONS BESIDES THE PLEASURE THERE IS ALWAYS REMORSE FROM THE INDULGENCE OF OUR PASSIONS AND AFTER ALL WHAT HAVE YOU MEN TO FEAR FROM ALL THIS
I UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD NOTHING TO FEAR THAT I SHOULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD SO I DECIDED UPON DESCENDING TO THE GARDEN
IT WAS THE END OF NOVEMBER ALL THE VERDURE OF THE GARDEN HAD DISAPPEARED THE TREES WERE NOTHING MORE THAN SKELETONS WITH THEIR LONG BONY ARMS AND THE DEAD LEAVES SOUNDED ON THE GRAVEL UNDER MY FEET MY TERROR OVERCAME ME TO SUCH A DEGREE AS I APPROACHED THE THICKET
AND NO ONE WAS PRESENT AT THE TIME BUT THE HEADMAN'S WIFE IN DUE TIME HER CHILD WAS BORN AND BY THE MERCY OF SINGH CHANDO IT WAS A SON AND WHEN THE BOY HAD GROWN A BIT AND COULD RUN ALONE HIS MOTHER DECIDED TO TAKE BACK THE GOLD COINS
I FEEL THAT MY PLACE IS NOT IN THE JUDGE'S SEAT BUT ON THE PRISONER'S STOOL YOU SAID MADAME DANGLARS YES I I THINK SIR YOU EXAGGERATE YOUR SITUATION SAID MADAME DANGLARS WHOSE BEAUTIFUL EYES SPARKLED FOR A MOMENT
SO THE WOMAN HASTENED BACK AND FOUND THE VILLAGERS STILL ASSEMBLED AND SHE TOLD THEM AS THE STRANGER HAD DIRECTED AND SHE AGREED TO BE SWORN AGAIN ON THE BODY OF THE CHILD AND THE HEADMAN PROMISED TO PAY FIVE GOLD PIECES IF THE CHILD WERE RESTORED TO LIFE
AND SINCE MONTE CRISTO SPEAKS BEFORE US OF A CHILD DISINTERRED WHEN THAT CHILD COULD NOT BE FOUND IT IS HE WHO IS IN POSSESSION OF OUR SECRET JUST GOD AVENGING GOD MURMURED MADAME DANGLARS
AND HAD LEFT HOME IN THE CARRIAGE SHE DIRECTED HER COURSE TOWARDS THE FAUBOURG SAINT GERMAIN WENT DOWN THE RUE MAZARINE AND STOPPED AT THE PASSAGE DU PONT NEUF SHE DESCENDED AND WENT THROUGH THE PASSAGE
SHE GAVE FIVE RUPEES TO THE VILLAGERS AND THEY MADE THE HEADMAN GIVE THEM TEN RUPEES FOR HAVING DECEIVED THEM AND THEY BOUGHT PIGS AND HAD A FEAST IN THE COURSE OF TIME THE BOY GREW UP AND HIS MOTHER URGED HIM TO MARRY HE ASKED HER
WHAT THEN ASKED HERMINE TREMBLING VIOLENTLY SOMETHING MORE TERRIBLE MORE FATAL MORE ALARMING FOR US THE CHILD WAS PERHAPS ALIVE AND THE ASSASSIN MAY HAVE SAVED IT
NIGHT ARRIVED I ALLOWED IT TO BECOME QUITE DARK I WAS WITHOUT A LIGHT IN THAT ROOM WHEN THE WIND SHOOK ALL THE DOORS BEHIND WHICH I CONTINUALLY EXPECTED TO SEE SOME SPY CONCEALED I TREMBLED
NO NOISE DISTURBED THE SILENCE BUT THE OWL WHOSE PIERCING CRY SEEMED TO BE CALLING UP THE PHANTOMS OF THE NIGHT I TIED MY LANTERN TO A FORKED BRANCH I HAD NOTICED A YEAR BEFORE
DESCRIBING A HALF CIRCLE WITH HIS CHAIR SO AS TO PLACE HIMSELF EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO MADAME DANGLARS IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SPEAKING ALONE WITH YOU AND I REGRET THAT WE HAVE ONLY NOW MET TO ENTER UPON A PAINFUL CONVERSATION
OH NO SAID VILLEFORT I NEVER CEASED TO SEARCH AND TO INQUIRE HOWEVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS I HAD ALLOWED MYSELF SOME RESPITE BUT NOW I WILL BEGIN WITH MORE PERSEVERANCE AND FURY THAN EVER SINCE FEAR URGES ME NOT MY CONSCIENCE BUT
MADAME DANGLARS HAD RISEN AND STOOD BEFORE THE PROCUREUR WHOSE HANDS SHE WRUNG IN HER FEEBLE GRASP I KNOW NOT I MERELY SUPPOSE SO AS I MIGHT SUPPOSE ANYTHING ELSE REPLIED VILLEFORT WITH A LOOK SO FIXED
THE INSTANT SHE APPEARED THE DOOR KEEPER ROSE CAME TO HER AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WAS NOT THE PERSON WITH WHOM THE PROCUREUR HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT AND ON HER AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER BEING GIVEN
I DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE STEP BY STEP THE ONLY THING I COULD NOT CONQUER WAS A STRANGE TREMBLING IN MY KNEES I GRASPED THE RAILINGS IF I HAD RELAXED MY HOLD FOR A MOMENT I SHOULD HAVE FALLEN I REACHED THE LOWER DOOR
NO SAID VILLEFORT BURYING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS NO A HUNDRED TIMES NO THEN YOU DID NOT BURY THE POOR CHILD THERE SIR WHY DID YOU DECEIVE ME WHERE DID YOU PLACE IT TELL ME WHERE THERE
AND YOU ALMOST DYING YOURSELF CAME TO MEET ME WE WERE OBLIGED TO KEEP SILENT UPON THE DREADFUL CATASTROPHE YOU HAD THE FORTITUDE TO REGAIN THE HOUSE ASSISTED BY YOUR NURSE A DUEL WAS THE PRETEXT FOR MY WOUND
IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE YOU MAD I HOPED FOR A MOMENT THAT IT MIGHT SAID VILLEFORT BUT THAT HAPPINESS WAS DENIED ME HOWEVER RECOVERING MY STRENGTH AND MY IDEAS WHY SAID I SHOULD THAT MAN HAVE CARRIED AWAY THE CORPSE
SO SHE WENT TO THE HEADMAN AND ASKED HIM FOR THEM BUT HE AND HIS WIFE SAID
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK I DID I FEIGNED A CRIMINAL PROCESS AND EMPLOYED ALL THE MOST ACUTE BLOODHOUNDS AND SKILFUL AGENTS IN SEARCH OF HER
YOU CAN FEEL FOR MY EMOTION CAN YOU NOT SPARE ME THEN I BESEECH YOU WHEN I LOOK AT THIS ROOM WHENCE SO MANY GUILTY CREATURES HAVE DEPARTED TREMBLING AND ASHAMED WHEN I LOOK AT THAT CHAIR BEFORE WHICH I NOW SIT TREMBLING AND ASHAMED
DO NOT CRY YOU TOLD ONE FALSEHOOD AND SO YOUR SON HAS DIED TAKE YOUR CHILD BACK TO THE VILLAGERS AND TELL THEM THAT IT WAS FIVE GOLD COINS AND NOT THREE THAT YOU GAVE TO THE HEADMAN AND IF YOU DO THIS THE CHILD WILL COME TO LIFE AGAIN
BEHIND ME WAS AN ARTIFICIAL ROCKERY INTENDED TO SERVE AS A RESTING PLACE FOR PERSONS WALKING IN THE GARDEN IN FALLING MY HAND RELAXING ITS HOLD OF THE LABURNUM FELT THE COLDNESS OF THE STONE ON MY RIGHT I SAW THE TREE BEHIND ME THE ROCK
PERCEIVED THAT TO AVERT THE MATERNAL STORM GATHERING OVER HIS HEAD
BUT SINCE THEN EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED IN AND ABOUT ME I AM ACCUSTOMED TO BRAVE DIFFICULTIES AND IN THE CONFLICT TO CRUSH THOSE WHO BY THEIR OWN FREE WILL OR BY CHANCE VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY INTERFERE WITH ME IN MY CAREER
THE BARONESS KNEW HOW CALM VILLEFORT NATURALLY WAS AND HIS PRESENT EXCITEMENT FRIGHTENED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO SCREAM BUT THE SOUND DIED IN HER THROAT HOW HAS THIS TERRIBLE PAST BEEN RECALLED CRIED VILLEFORT
HOW I HAVE LONGED FOR ROYAL WEALTH TO PURCHASE A MILLION OF SECRETS FROM A MILLION OF MEN AND TO FIND MINE AMONG THEM AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME I TOOK UP MY SPADE I ASKED MYSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN
SO THE WOMAN LAID HER HANDS ON THE DEAD CHILD AND SWORE AND IT WAS RESTORED TO LIFE THEN THE HEADMAN WAS DUMBFOUNDED AND RELUCTANTLY BROUGHT OUT FIVE GOLD PIECES AND GAVE THEM TO THE WOMAN
WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW THE PALE MOON SHEDDING A LONG STREAM OF WHITE LIGHT ON THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE LIKE A SPECTRE I LEANED AGAINST THE WALL AND NEARLY SHRIEKED I SEEMED TO BE GOING MAD AT LAST I MASTERED MY AGITATION
I HAVE SO MUCH WEALTH THAT I CANNOT LOOK AFTER IT ALL ASK HIM TO TAKE AWAY HALF FROM ME THE YOUTH PROMISED AND WENT ON AND HE MET ANOTHER MAN WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SO MANY CATTLE THAT HE COULD NOT BUILD ENOUGH COW HOUSES FOR THEM
COME BEFORE HIM DISGUISED UNDER THE SPECIOUS FORM OF NECESSITY THEN AFTER ERROR HAS BEEN COMMITTED IN A MOMENT OF EXCITEMENT OF DELIRIUM OR OF FEAR WE SEE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED AND ESCAPED IT
YOU UNDERSTAND THEN THAT IF IT WERE SO SAID HE RISING IN HIS TURN AND APPROACHING THE BARONESS TO SPEAK TO HER IN A LOWER TONE WE ARE LOST THIS CHILD LIVES AND SOME ONE KNOWS IT LIVES SOME ONE IS IN POSSESSION OF OUR SECRET
I CONSIDER MYSELF AS BRAVE AS MOST MEN BUT WHEN I DREW FROM MY BREAST THE LITTLE KEY OF THE STAIRCASE WHICH I HAD FOUND IN MY COAT THAT LITTLE KEY WE BOTH USED TO CHERISH SO MUCH WHICH YOU WISHED TO HAVE FASTENED TO A GOLDEN RING
BUT IT HAD JUST BEEN LET FOR NINE YEARS I FOUND THE TENANT I PRETENDED THAT I DISLIKED THE IDEA THAT A HOUSE BELONGING TO MY WIFE'S FATHER AND MOTHER SHOULD PASS INTO THE HANDS OF STRANGERS

BY ATTEMPTING TO DRAMATIZE FOR INSTANCE THE ENTIRE STORY OF THE ILIAD IN THE EPIC OWING TO ITS SCALE EVERY PART IS TREATED AT PROPER LENGTH WITH A DRAMA HOWEVER ON THE SAME STORY THE RESULT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING
I AM NOT SO MAD ANSWERED SANCHO BUT I AM MORE PEPPERY BUT APART FROM ALL THIS WHAT HAS YOUR WORSHIP TO EAT UNTIL I COME BACK WILL YOU SALLY OUT ON THE ROAD LIKE CARDENIO TO FORCE IT FROM THE SHEPHERDS
HAVING BEEN OFFERED IN SACRIFICE AND SPIRITED AWAY FROM HER SACRIFICERS INTO ANOTHER LAND WHERE THE CUSTOM WAS TO SACRIFICE ALL STRANGERS TO THE GODDESS SHE WAS MADE THERE THE PRIESTESS OF THIS RITE
THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER FORM OF QUALIFIED METAPHOR HAVING GIVEN THE THING THE ALIEN NAME ONE MAY BY A NEGATIVE ADDITION DENY OF IT ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES NATURALLY ASSOCIATED WITH ITS NEW NAME
IN THIS WAY SEEING EVERYTHING WITH THE VIVIDNESS OF AN EYE WITNESS AS IT WERE HE WILL DEVISE WHAT IS APPROPRIATE AND BE LEAST LIKELY TO OVERLOOK INCONGRUITIES THIS IS SHOWN BY WHAT WAS CENSURED IN
WHICH PROTAGORAS HAS CRITICIZED AS BEING A COMMAND WHERE A PRAYER WAS MEANT SINCE TO BID ONE DO OR NOT DO HE TELLS US IS A COMMAND
A SIZE TO BE TAKEN IN BY THE EYE SO A STORY OR PLOT MUST BE OF SOME LENGTH BUT OF A LENGTH TO BE TAKEN IN BY THE MEMORY AS FOR THE LIMIT OF ITS LENGTH SO FAR AS THAT IS RELATIVE TO PUBLIC PERFORMANCES AND SPECTATORS
AS THE MOST EXALTED PRINCESS ON EARTH IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT ALL THOSE POETS WHO SANG THE PRAISES OF LADIES UNDER THE FANCY NAMES THEY GIVE THEM HAD ANY SUCH MISTRESSES
SHOULD HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH SUCH A MEAN LOW STUPID FELLOW AS SO AND SO WHEN IN THIS HOUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MASTERS GRADUATES AND DIVINITY STUDENTS FROM AMONG WHOM YOU MIGHT CHOOSE AS IF THEY WERE A LOT OF PEARS SAYING THIS ONE I'LL TAKE
CUT SOME HE ASKED HIS MASTER'S BLESSING AND NOT WITHOUT MANY TEARS ON BOTH SIDES TOOK HIS LEAVE OF HIM
BUT THE TWO INCIDENTS HAD NO PROBABLE OR NECESSARY CONNEXION WITH ONE ANOTHER INSTEAD OF DOING THAT HE TOOK AN ACTION WITH A UNITY OF THE KIND WE ARE DESCRIBING AS THE SUBJECT OF THE ODYSSEY AS ALSO OF THE ILIAD
CERTAIN ALSO OF THOSE WITHIN THE PLAY FORMING THE COMPLICATION AND THE REST THE DENOUEMENT BY COMPLICATION I MEAN ALL FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY TO THE POINT JUST BEFORE THE CHANGE IN THE HERO'S FORTUNES BY
YET IN THEIR PERIPETIES AS ALSO IN THEIR SIMPLE PLOTS THE POETS I MEAN SHOW WONDERFUL SKILL IN AIMING AT THE KIND OF EFFECT THEY DESIRE A TRAGIC SITUATION THAT AROUSES THE HUMAN FEELING IN ONE LIKE THE CLEVER VILLAIN
THE POET'S AIM THEN SHOULD BE TO COMBINE EVERY ELEMENT OF INTEREST IF POSSIBLE OR ELSE THE MORE IMPORTANT AND THE MAJOR PART OF THEM THIS IS NOW ESPECIALLY NECESSARY OWING TO THE UNFAIR CRITICISM TO WHICH THE POET IS SUBJECTED IN THESE DAYS
THE UNITY OF A PLOT DOES NOT CONSIST AS SOME SUPPOSE IN ITS HAVING ONE MAN AS ITS SUBJECT AN INFINITY OF THINGS BEFALL THAT ONE MAN SOME OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REDUCE TO UNITY
SO I TOO AM DOOMED TO BE SACRIFICED AS MY SISTER WAS AND THE DISCLOSURE LED TO HIS SALVATION THIS DONE THE NEXT THING AFTER THE PROPER NAMES HAVE BEEN FIXED AS A BASIS FOR THE STORY
AND NEED NOT BE COUNTED THERE IS NO NOUN HOWEVER ENDING IN A MUTE OR IN EITHER OF THE TWO SHORT VOWELS E AND O ONLY THREE
THAT WILL DO SAID SANCHO NOW LET YOUR WORSHIP SIGN IT THERE IS NO NEED TO SIGN IT SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT MERELY TO PUT MY FLOURISH WHICH IS THE SAME AS A SIGNATURE AND ENOUGH FOR THREE ASSES OR EVEN THREE HUNDRED
IS TO WORK IN EPISODES OR ACCESSORY INCIDENTS ONE MUST MIND HOWEVER THAT THE EPISODES ARE APPROPRIATE LIKE THE FIT OF MADNESS IN ORESTES WHICH LED TO HIS ARREST AND THE PURIFYING WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT HIS SALVATION
BEAUTY IS A MATTER OF SIZE AND ORDER AND THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE EITHER ONE IN A VERY MINUTE CREATURE SINCE OUR PERCEPTION BECOMES INDISTINCT AS IT APPROACHES INSTANTANEITY OR TWO
THOUGH NOT IN REFERENCE TO THE SAME PEOPLE SIGUNOS FOR INSTANCE IS AN ORDINARY WORD IN CYPRUS AND A STRANGE WORD WITH US
AND THESE TWO THINGS ARE TO BE FOUND IN DULCINEA IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE FOR IN BEAUTY NO ONE EQUALS HER AND IN GOOD NAME FEW APPROACH HER AND TO PUT THE WHOLE THING IN A NUTSHELL I PERSUADE MYSELF THAT ALL I SAY IS AS I SAY
WE MAINTAIN THAT TRAGEDY IS PRIMARILY AN IMITATION OF ACTION AND THAT IT IS MAINLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE ACTION THAT IT IMITATES THE PERSONAL AGENTS THIRD COMES THE ELEMENT OF THOUGHT
AND ONE DAY SAID TO THE WORTHY WIDOW BY WAY OF BROTHERLY REMONSTRANCE I AM SURPRISED SENORA AND NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON THAT A WOMAN OF SUCH HIGH STANDING SO FAIR AND SO RICH AS YOU ARE
EMPEDOCLEAN EQUIVALENT AND OLD AGE D AS THE EVENING OR SUNSET OF LIFE B PLUS C
OR WHAT IS APPROPRIATE TO THE OCCASION
END IN I AND FIVE IN T
THE HEALTH THAT HE HIMSELF ENJOYS NOT IF THY BEAUTY DESPISES ME IF THY WORTH IS NOT FOR ME IF THY SCORN IS MY AFFLICTION THOUGH I BE SUFFICIENTLY LONG SUFFERING HARDLY SHALL I ENDURE THIS ANXIETY WHICH
WITHOUT MORE ADO HE CUT A COUPLE OF GAMBADOS IN THE AIR AND A COUPLE OF SOMERSAULTS HEELS OVER HEAD
AND YET FAIL TO PRODUCE THE TRUE TRAGIC EFFECT BUT ONE WILL HAVE MUCH BETTER SUCCESS WITH A TRAGEDY WHICH HOWEVER INFERIOR IN THESE RESPECTS HAS A PLOT A COMBINATION OF INCIDENTS IN IT
ALL THAT THEY WILL BE METAPHORICALLY DESCRIBED IN JUST THE SAME WAY THUS TO CAST FORTH SEED
OR NOT THE SAME AS ANOTHER TO DO SO ON THE GROUND BEFORE ALL ELSE OF THEIR PLOT
THE LETTER OR ULTIMATE ELEMENT THE SYLLABLE THE CONJUNCTION THE ARTICLE THE NOUN THE VERB THE CASE AND THE SPEECH ONE
SUNLIGHT A AS SOWING D TO THE SEED CORN C HENCE THE EXPRESSION IN THE POET SOWING AROUND A GOD CREATED FLAME D PLUS A
ONE SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER WHAT HAS BEEN SAID MORE THAN ONCE AND NOT WRITE A TRAGEDY ON AN EPIC BODY OF INCIDENT
AS LONG SHORT OR OF VARIABLE QUANTITY AND FURTHER AS HAVING AN ACUTE GRAVE OR INTERMEDIATE ACCENT THE DETAILS OF THESE MATTERS WE MUST LEAVE TO THE METRICIANS
THINE TILL DEATH THE KNIGHT OF THE RUEFUL COUNTENANCE BY THE LIFE OF MY FATHER SAID SANCHO WHEN HE HEARD THE LETTER
WHETHER THE POET KNOWS THESE THINGS OR NOT HIS ART AS A POET IS NEVER SERIOUSLY CRITICIZED ON THAT ACCOUNT
A CASE OF A NOUN OR VERB IS WHEN THE WORD MEANS OF OR TO A THING AND SO FORTH
C SO IS EVENING B TO DAY A ONE WILL ACCORDINGLY DESCRIBE EVENING B AS THE OLD AGE OF THE DAY D PLUS A OR BY THE
THOUGH AN ATTRACTION IS THE LEAST ARTISTIC OF ALL THE PARTS AND HAS LEAST TO DO WITH THE ART OF POETRY THE TRAGIC EFFECT IS QUITE POSSIBLE WITHOUT A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE AND ACTORS
CHARACTERS DICTION THOUGHT SPECTACLE AND MELODY TWO OF THEM ARISING FROM THE MEANS ONE FROM THE MANNER AND THREE FROM THE OBJECTS OF THE DRAMATIC IMITATION
THE TURNS GIVEN TO THE LANGUAGE WHEN SPOKEN
DID I NOT TELL THEE SO SAID DON QUIXOTE WAIT SANCHO AND I WILL DO THEM IN THE SAYING OF A CREDO AND PULLING OFF HIS BREECHES IN ALL HASTE HE STRIPPED HIMSELF TO HIS SKIN AND HIS SHIRT AND THEN
THE FOURTH CONSTITUENT IS THAT OF SPECTACLE EXEMPLIFIED IN THE
THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE SIX IS THE COMBINATION OF THE INCIDENTS OF THE STORY TRAGEDY IS ESSENTIALLY AN IMITATION NOT OF PERSONS BUT OF ACTION AND LIFE OF HAPPINESS AND MISERY
AND IN THE SECOND MELODY AND DICTION THESE TWO BEING THE MEANS OF THEIR IMITATION HERE BY DICTION I MEAN MERELY THIS THE COMPOSITION OF THE VERSES AND BY MELODY WHAT IS TOO COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD TO REQUIRE EXPLANATION
POLEOS PELEIADEO FOR PELEIDON IT IS SAID TO BE CURTAILED WHEN IT HAS LOST A PART
IF SHE KNEW ME SHE'D BE IN AWE OF ME IN FAITH SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE TO ALL APPEARANCE THOU ART NO SOUNDER IN THY WITS THAN I
NEITHER MORE NOR LESS AND I PICTURE HER IN MY IMAGINATION AS I WOULD HAVE HER TO BE AS WELL IN BEAUTY AS IN CONDITION HELEN APPROACHES HER NOT NOR DOES LUCRETIA COME UP TO HER
HAVE AS MUCH CARE AS OF HIS OWN PERSON HE SET OUT FOR THE PLAIN STREWING AT INTERVALS THE BRANCHES OF BROOM AS HIS MASTER HAD RECOMMENDED HIM AND SO HE WENT HIS WAY THOUGH DON QUIXOTE STILL ENTREATED HIM TO SEE HIM
AND BY THE KINDS SEPARATELY I MEAN THAT SOME PORTIONS ARE WORKED OUT WITH VERSE ONLY AND OTHERS IN
COSTUMIER THAN THE POET
THE STORY ALSO OF HERACLES MUST BE ONE STORY HOMER HOWEVER EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD THIS POINT QUITE WELL WHETHER BY ART OR INSTINCT JUST IN THE SAME WAY AS HE EXCELS THE REST IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT
POLYGNOTUS FOR WHEREAS THE LATTER IS STRONG IN CHARACTER THE WORK OF ZEUXIS IS DEVOID OF IT AND AGAIN ONE MAY STRING TOGETHER A SERIES OF CHARACTERISTIC SPEECHES OF THE UTMOST FINISH AS REGARDS DICTION AND THOUGHT
H AND O AND IN A AMONG THE VOWELS THAT MAY BE LONG ARE FEMININES SO THAT THERE IS AN EQUAL NUMBER OF MASCULINE AND FEMININE
A LENGTH WHICH ALLOWS OF THE HERO PASSING BY A SERIES OF PROBABLE OR NECESSARY STAGES FROM MISFORTUNE TO HAPPINESS OR FROM HAPPINESS TO MISFORTUNE MAY SUFFICE AS A LIMIT FOR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORY
SINCE IT IS FROM THESE THAT WE ASCRIBE CERTAIN QUALITIES TO THEIR ACTIONS THERE ARE IN THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS THEREFORE TWO CAUSES CHARACTER AND THOUGHT
D TO THE THIRD C FOR ONE MAY THEN METAPHORICALLY PUT B IN LIEU OF D AND D IN LIEU OF B NOW AND THEN TOO THEY QUALIFY
AND THAT THE CHARACTERS COME SECOND COMPARE THE PARALLEL IN PAINTING WHERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLOURS LAID ON WITHOUT ORDER WILL NOT GIVE ONE THE SAME PLEASURE AS A SIMPLE BLACK AND WHITE SKETCH OF A PORTRAIT
BEFORE PROCEEDING TO LENGTHEN IT OUT BY THE INSERTION OF EPISODES THE FOLLOWING WILL SHOW HOW THE UNIVERSAL ELEMENT IN IPHIGENIA FOR INSTANCE MAY BE VIEWED A CERTAIN MAIDEN
B PLUS C OR TO TAKE ANOTHER INSTANCE
AND I PROMISE THEE THOU WILT NOT TELL OF AS MANY AS I MEAN TO PERFORM FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MASTER MINE SAID SANCHO
HER LADYSHIP HAD BEST NOT DRIVE ME TO SAY IT FOR BY GOD I WILL SPEAK OUT AND LET OFF EVERYTHING CHEAP EVEN IF IT DOESN'T SELL I AM PRETTY GOOD AT THAT SHE LITTLE KNOWS ME FAITH
LONG AFTER THAT THE BROTHER OF THE PRIESTESS HAPPENED TO COME THE FACT HOWEVER OF THE ORACLE HAVING FOR A CERTAIN REASON BIDDEN HIM GO THITHER AND HIS OBJECT IN GOING ARE OUTSIDE THE PLOT OF THE PLAY
TO THIS EFFECT MISTRESS NIECE BY THIS FIRST OF ASS COLTS PLEASE PAY TO SANCHO PANZA MY SQUIRE THREE OF THE FIVE I LEFT AT HOME IN YOUR CHARGE SAID THREE ASS COLTS TO BE PAID AND DELIVERED FOR THE SAME
OR OF TWO SIGNIFICANT PARTS IT IS POSSIBLE ALSO TO HAVE TRIPLE QUADRUPLE OR HIGHER COMPOUNDS LIKE MOST OF OUR AMPLIFIED NAMES
WHERE THAT IS NOT OBVIOUS HENCE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR CHARACTER IN A SPEECH ON A PURELY INDIFFERENT SUBJECT THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND IS SHOWN IN ALL THEY SAY WHEN PROVING OR DISPROVING SOME PARTICULAR POINT
AN INSTANCE OF THIS WOULD BE TO CALL THE SHIELD
AND SO IT SUFFICES ME TO THINK AND BELIEVE THAT THE GOOD ALDONZA LORENZO IS FAIR AND VIRTUOUS AND AS TO HER PEDIGREE IT IS VERY LITTLE MATTER FOR NO ONE WILL EXAMINE INTO IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONFERRING ANY ORDER UPON HER
AT THE TIME WHEN HE IS CONSTRUCTING HIS PLOTS AND ENGAGED ON THE DICTION IN WHICH THEY ARE WORKED OUT THE POET SHOULD REMEMBER ONE TO PUT THE ACTUAL SCENES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BEFORE HIS EYES
THOU MUST KNOW THAT A CERTAIN WIDOW FAIR YOUNG INDEPENDENT AND RICH AND ABOVE ALL FREE AND EASY FELL IN LOVE WITH A STURDY STRAPPING YOUNG LAY BROTHER HIS SUPERIOR CAME TO KNOW OF IT
AND FELT EASY AND SATISFIED IN HIS MIND THAT HE COULD SWEAR HE HAD LEFT HIS MASTER MAD AND SO WE WILL LEAVE HIM TO FOLLOW HIS ROAD UNTIL HIS RETURN
THE LETTERS DIFFER IN VARIOUS WAYS AS PRODUCED BY DIFFERENT CONFORMATIONS OR IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE MOUTH AS ASPIRATED NOT ASPIRATED OR SOMETIMES ONE AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER
CLEON WALKS CLEON IS AN INSTANCE OF SUCH A PART A SPEECH IS SAID TO BE ONE IN TWO WAYS EITHER AS SIGNIFYING ONE THING OR AS A UNION OF SEVERAL SPEECHES MADE INTO ONE BY CONJUNCTION
IN A DRAMATIC NOT IN A NARRATIVE FORM WITH INCIDENTS AROUSING PITY AND FEAR WHEREWITH TO ACCOMPLISH ITS CATHARSIS OF SUCH EMOTIONS
THAT FROM SPECIES TO GENUS IN TRULY TEN THOUSAND GOOD DEEDS HAS ULYSSES WROUGHT WHERE TEN THOUSAND WHICH IS A PARTICULAR LARGE NUMBER IS PUT IN PLACE OF THE GENERIC A LARGE NUMBER
IF IT BE THY PLEASURE TO GIVE ME RELIEF I AM THINE IF NOT DO AS MAY BE PLEASING TO THEE FOR BY ENDING MY LIFE I SHALL SATISFY THY CRUELTY AND MY DESIRE
WHICH WILL BE WITH THE NEWS YOUR WORSHIP DESIRES AND DESERVES IF NOT LET THE LADY DULCINEA LOOK TO IT IF SHE DOES NOT ANSWER REASONABLY
THAT I WON'T TAKE BUT SHE REPLIED TO HIM WITH GREAT SPRIGHTLINESS AND CANDOUR MY DEAR SIR YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN AND YOUR IDEAS ARE VERY OLD FASHIONED IF YOU THINK THAT I HAVE MADE A BAD CHOICE IN SO AND SO
HOWEVER NOT TO MISS ME AND LOSE THYSELF THE BEST PLAN WILL BE TO CUT SOME BRANCHES OF THE BROOM THAT IS SO ABUNDANT ABOUT HERE AND AS THOU GOEST TO LAY THEM AT INTERVALS UNTIL THOU HAST COME OUT UPON THE PLAIN
AND I FOR MY PART RECKON HER THE MOST EXALTED PRINCESS IN THE WORLD FOR THOU SHOULDST KNOW SANCHO IF THOU DOST NOT KNOW THAT TWO THINGS ALONE BEYOND ALL OTHERS ARE INCENTIVES TO LOVE AND THESE ARE GREAT BEAUTY AND A GOOD NAME
INDIVISIBLE SOUNDS ARE UTTERED BY THE BRUTES ALSO BUT NO ONE OF THESE IS A LETTER IN OUR SENSE OF THE TERM THESE ELEMENTARY SOUNDS ARE EITHER VOWELS SEMIVOWELS OR MUTES
AN END IS THAT WHICH IS NATURALLY AFTER SOMETHING ITSELF EITHER AS ITS NECESSARY OR USUAL CONSEQUENT AND WITH NOTHING ELSE AFTER IT AND A MIDDLE THAT WHICH IS BY NATURE AFTER ONE THING
THE TRAGEDIES OF MOST OF THE MODERNS ARE CHARACTERLESS A DEFECT COMMON AMONG POETS OF ALL KINDS AND WITH ITS COUNTERPART IN PAINTING
LET NOT THAT ANXIETY TROUBLE THEE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE FOR EVEN IF I HAD IT I SHOULD NOT EAT ANYTHING BUT THE HERBS AND THE FRUITS WHICH THIS MEADOW AND THESE TREES MAY YIELD ME THE BEAUTY OF THIS BUSINESS OF MINE LIES IN NOT EATING
THE LIMIT HOWEVER SET BY THE ACTUAL NATURE OF THE THING IS THIS THE LONGER THE STORY CONSISTENTLY WITH ITS BEING COMPREHENSIBLE AS A WHOLE THE FINER IT IS BY REASON OF ITS MAGNITUDE AS A ROUGH GENERAL FORMULA
AND THERE IS NOTHING ELSE BESIDES THESE SIX OF THESE ITS FORMATIVE ELEMENTS
OF A SIGNIFICANT AND A NON SIGNIFICANT PART
BUT IF IT IS YOUR WORSHIP'S PLEASURE THAT I SHOULD SEE SOME INSANITIES DO THEM IN YOUR CLOTHES SHORT ONES AND SUCH AS COME READIEST TO HAND FOR I MYSELF WANT NOTHING OF THE SORT AND AS I HAVE SAID IT WILL BE A SAVING OF TIME FOR MY RETURN
OF THEIR ACTIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY OF THEIR SUCCESS OR FAILURE IN THEIR LIVES NOW THE ACTION THAT WHICH WAS DONE IS REPRESENTED IN THE PLAY BY THE FABLE OR PLOT THE FABLE
THESE WILL SERVE THEE AFTER THE FASHION OF THE CLUE IN THE LABYRINTH OF THESEUS AS MARKS AND SIGNS FOR FINDING ME ON THY RETURN SO I WILL SAID SANCHO PANZA AND HAVING
I SAY THAT YOUR WORSHIP IS ENTIRELY RIGHT SAID SANCHO AND THAT I AM AN ASS BUT I KNOW NOT HOW THE NAME OF ASS CAME INTO MY MOUTH FOR A ROPE
IN WRITING AN ODYSSEY HE DID NOT MAKE THE POEM COVER ALL THAT EVER BEFELL HIS HERO IT BEFELL HIM FOR INSTANCE TO GET WOUNDED ON PARNASSUS AND ALSO TO FEIGN MADNESS AT THE TIME OF THE CALL TO ARMS
NOR ANY OTHER OF THE FAMOUS WOMEN OF TIMES PAST GREEK BARBARIAN OR LATIN AND LET EACH SAY WHAT HE WILL FOR IF IN THIS I AM TAKEN TO TASK BY THE IGNORANT I SHALL NOT BE CENSURED BY THE CRITICAL
OF THIS LAST KIND EIGHT A SPEECH IS A COMPOSITE SIGNIFICANT SOUND SOME OF THE PARTS OF WHICH HAVE A CERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE BY THEMSELVES
THAT WE ARE HAPPY OR THE REVERSE IN A PLAY ACCORDINGLY THEY DO NOT ACT IN ORDER TO PORTRAY THE CHARACTERS THEY INCLUDE THE CHARACTERS FOR THE SAKE OF THE ACTION
FOR THE OLDER POETS MAKE THEIR PERSONAGES DISCOURSE LIKE STATESMEN AND THE MODERNS LIKE RHETORICIANS
DENOUEMENT YET THERE ARE MANY DRAMATISTS WHO AFTER A GOOD COMPLICATION FAIL IN THE DENOUEMENT BUT IT IS NECESSARY FOR BOTH POINTS OF CONSTRUCTION TO BE ALWAYS DULY MASTERED
A CERTAIN MAN HAS BEEN ABROAD MANY YEARS POSEIDON IS EVER ON THE WATCH FOR HIM AND HE IS ALL ALONE MATTERS AT HOME TOO HAVE COME TO THIS THAT HIS SUBSTANCE IS BEING WASTED
A NON SIGNIFICANT SOUND WHICH WHEN ONE SIGNIFICANT SOUND IS FORMABLE OUT OF SEVERAL NEITHER HINDERS NOR AIDS THE UNION AND WHICH IF THE SPEECH
AS FAR AS MAY BE TOO THE POET SHOULD EVEN ACT HIS STORY WITH THE VERY GESTURES OF HIS PERSONAGES GIVEN THE SAME NATURAL QUALIFICATIONS HE WHO FEELS THE EMOTIONS TO BE DESCRIBED WILL BE THE MOST CONVINCING
SOVEREIGN AND EXALTED LADY THE PIERCED BY THE POINT OF ABSENCE THE WOUNDED TO THE HEART'S CORE SENDS THEE SWEETEST DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO
IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT A SPEECH IS NOT ALWAYS MADE UP OF NOUN AND VERB IT MAY BE WITHOUT A VERB LIKE THE DEFINITION OF MAN BUT IT WILL ALWAYS HAVE SOME PART WITH A CERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE BY ITSELF IN THE SPEECH
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SWEAR WITHOUT A WEIGHT ON MY CONSCIENCE THAT I HAD SEEN YOU DO MAD THINGS IT WOULD BE WELL FOR ME TO SEE IF IT WERE ONLY ONE THOUGH IN YOUR WORSHIP'S REMAINING HERE I HAVE SEEN A VERY GREAT ONE
EITHER FAIL UTTERLY OR HAVE BUT ILL SUCCESS ON THE STAGE
NOTHING OF THE KIND THEY ONLY INVENT THEM FOR THE MOST PART TO FURNISH A SUBJECT FOR THEIR VERSES AND THAT THEY MAY PASS FOR LOVERS OR FOR MEN VALIANT ENOUGH TO BE SO
P S OR IN THE TWO COMPOUNDS OF THIS LAST P S AND X ARE MASCULINES ALL ENDING IN THE INVARIABLY LONG VOWELS
A VOWEL IS A LETTER HAVING AN AUDIBLE SOUND WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF ANOTHER LETTER
WITH AN A THE VARIOUS FORMS OF THE SYLLABLE ALSO BELONG TO THE THEORY OF METRE THREE A CONJUNCTION IS A
IS NOT TO BE MENTIONED IN THE HOUSE OF HIM WHO HAS BEEN HANGED BUT NOW FOR THE LETTER AND THEN GOD BE WITH YOU I AM OFF DON QUIXOTE TOOK OUT THE NOTE BOOK AND RETIRING TO ONE SIDE VERY DELIBERATELY BEGAN TO WRITE THE LETTER
AGAIN TO BE BEAUTIFUL A LIVING CREATURE AND EVERY WHOLE MADE UP OF PARTS MUST NOT ONLY PRESENT A CERTAIN ORDER IN ITS ARRANGEMENT OF PARTS BUT ALSO BE OF A CERTAIN DEFINITE MAGNITUDE
WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF A STORY AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF NEARLY ALL THE EARLY DRAMATISTS WE MAINTAIN THEREFORE THAT THE FIRST ESSENTIAL THE LIFE AND SOUL SO TO SPEAK OF TRAGEDY IS THE PLOT
ON HIS COMING HE WAS ARRESTED AND ABOUT TO BE SACRIFICED WHEN HE REVEALED WHO HE WAS
AND HAS ALSO ANOTHER AFTER IT A WELL CONSTRUCTED PLOT THEREFORE CANNOT EITHER BEGIN OR END AT ANY POINT ONE LIKES BEGINNING AND END IN IT MUST BE OF THE FORMS JUST DESCRIBED
AND HIS SON'S DEATH PLOTTED BY SUITORS TO HIS WIFE THEN HE ARRIVES THERE HIMSELF AFTER HIS GRIEVOUS SUFFERINGS REVEALS HIMSELF AND FALLS ON HIS ENEMIES AND THE END IS HIS SALVATION AND THEIR DEATH
THIS BEING ALL THAT IS PROPER TO THE ODYSSEY EVERYTHING ELSE IN IT IS EPISODE
NOT A FEW OF THE DRAMATISTS HAVE MADE DUE USE AS EVERY PLAY ONE MAY SAY ADMITS OF SPECTACLE CHARACTER FABLE DICTION MELODY AND THOUGHT
IT IS TO BE REMEMBERED THAT IN A COMPOUND WE DO NOT THINK OF THE PARTS AS HAVING A SIGNIFICANCE ALSO BY THEMSELVES IN THE NAME THEODORUS FOR INSTANCE THE DORON MEANS NOTHING TO US
OBSERVE THE LANDMARKS WELL SAID DON QUIXOTE FOR I WILL TRY NOT TO GO FAR FROM THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD AND I WILL EVEN TAKE CARE TO MOUNT THE HIGHEST OF THESE ROCKS TO SEE IF I CAN DISCOVER THEE RETURNING
WITH ITS SEVERAL INCIDENTS SO CLOSELY CONNECTED THAT THE TRANSPOSAL OR WITHDRAWAL
WHY JOSEPH CAN IT BE YOU YES MA'AM YES MISS ANSWERED HE AGAIN TOUCHING HIS HAT WITH ALL THE RESPECT HE COULD POSSIBLY PUT INTO THE ACTION IT'S A LUCKY DAY WHICH I SEE YOU ONCE MORE UPON IT WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT SAID MISSUS COLEMAN
FINALLY THE SCIENTIST SAID OH YES WE MAY FIND AN IDOL I UNDERSTAND THE ANCIENT PEOPLE WHO WERE HERE LONG BEFORE THE SPANIARDS CAME WORSHIPED IDOLS BUT WE SHALL TAKE WHATEVER ANTIQUITIES WE FIND HUH GRUNTED JACINTO
TOM AND NED KICKED OUTSIDE THE BAT THE FORMER HAD KILLED IN THEIR TENT AND THEN BOTH WENT BACK TO THEIR COTS BUT IT WAS SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE THEY FELL ASLEEP AND THEY DID NOT HAVE MUCH TIME TO REST
AND THEN MISSUS COLEMAN TOOK OUT HER PURSE SAYING AND WHAT'S YOUR FARE JOSEPH NO THANK YOU MA'AM SAID JOSEPH IT WAS YOUR OWN OLD HORSE AS TOOK YOU AND ME YOU PAID LONG AGO HE JUMPED ON HIS BOX BEFORE SHE COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD
THE INDIANS SEEMED GLAD TO LEAVE THE PLACE OF THE BATS AS THEY CALLED THE CAMP SITE JACINTO EXPLAINED THAT THE INDIANS BELIEVED A VAMPIRE COULD KILL THEM WHILE THEY SLEPT AND THEY WERE VERY MUCH AFRAID OF THE BLOOD SUCKING BATS
KNOCKING IT INTO THE CORNER OF THE TENT WITH A THUD THAT TOLD IT MUST BE COMPLETELY STUNNED IF NOT KILLED
WHERE THE DEER WERE PLAYING IN THE GRASS GREW MAGNIFICENT OAKS AND BEECHES AND IF THE BARK OF ONE OF THE TREES WAS CRACKED THERE GRASS AND LONG CREEPING PLANTS GREW IN THE CREVICES AND THERE WERE LARGE CALM LAKES THERE TOO
HE IS THE SON OF A KING BUT ON HE WENT WITHOUT BEING DISHEARTENED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WOOD WHERE THE MOST WONDERFUL FLOWERS WERE GROWING THERE STOOD WHITE LILIES WITH BLOOD RED STAMINA
WOODROOF AND ANEMONIES GREW ALMOST TOO HIGH BLOOMING CONVOLVULUSES AND BLACKBERRY BUSHES HUNG IN LONG GARLANDS FROM TREE TO TREE WHERE THE NIGHTINGALE SANG AND THE SUNBEAMS WERE PLAYING IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS NO PLACE FOR GIRLS TO GO
AND ONCE HE SENT THE COMB FLYING OUT OF THE STABLE DOOR TO THE GREAT AMUSEMENT OF THE MEN BUT JACK FETCHED IT AGAIN AND DIAMOND BEGAN ONCE MORE AND DID NOT LEAVE OFF UNTIL HE HAD DONE THE WHOLE BUSINESS FAIRLY WELL IF NOT IN A FIRST RATE EXPERIENCED FASHION
THE WATERS SEETHED AND BUBBLED AS THE ALLIGATORS FOUGHT UNDER IT FOR POSSESSION OF THE PADDLER TOM FIRED BULLET AFTER BULLET FROM HIS WONDERFUL RIFLE INTO THE SPOT BUT THOUGH HE KILLED SOME OF THE ALLIGATORS THIS DID NOT SAVE THE MAN'S LIFE HIS BODY WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN
THE UNCANNY CREATURES FLEW IN AND OUT AMONG THE TREES AND TENTS NOW SWOOPING LOW NEAR THE INDIANS OR THE TRAVELERS AT SUCH TIMES CLUBS WOULD BE USED OFTEN WITH THE EFFECT OF KILLING OR STUNNING THE FLYING PESTS
AND SCRATCHED HIS FACE AND HANDS AND FEET TILL THEY BLED THE KING'S SON GOT SOME SCRATCHES TOO BUT THE SUN SHONE ON HIS PATH
WE MUST HAVE OVERSLEPT NED WE WERE TO START BEFORE OLD SOL GOT IN HIS HEAVY WORK BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD BREAKFAST YET I DIDN'T HEAR ANY ONE CALL US REMARKED NED NOR I WONDER IF WE'RE THE ONLY LAZY BIRDS
HE RUSHED IN AND SENT THE ASSAILANTS FLYING IN ALL DIRECTIONS THE GIRL THANKED DIAMOND AND BEGAN SWEEPING AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED WHILE HIS FATHER LED HIM AWAY WITH THE HELP OF OLD TOM THE WATERMAN HE WAS SOON WASHED INTO DECENCY
SOME ROUGH YOUNG IMPS HAD PICKED A QUARREL WITH HER AND WERE NOW HAULING AT HER BROOM TO GET IT AWAY FROM HER BUT AS THEY DID NOT PULL ALL TOGETHER SHE WAS HOLDING IT AGAINST THEM SCOLDING AND ENTREATING ALTERNATELY DIAMOND WAS OFF HIS BOX IN A MOMENT AND RUNNING TO THE HELP OF THE GIRL
MOST OF WHICH LIVED ON FRUIT OR ON INSECTS THEY CAUGHT THE BLOOD SUCKING BATS WERE COMPARATIVELY FEW AND THE MIGRATORY SORT FEWER STILL WELL WE'RE ON OUR WAY ONCE MORE REMARKED TOM AS AGAIN THEY WERE IN THE CANOES BEING PADDLED UP THE RIVER
BLESS THE CHILD HE FORGETS NOTHING SAID HIS MOTHER REALLY DIAMOND A BODY WOULD NEED TO MIND WHAT THEY SAY TO YOU WHY SAID DIAMOND I ONLY THINK ABOUT IT
HE GOT HOLD OF THE BROOM AT HER END AND PULLED ALONG WITH HER BUT THE BOYS PROCEEDED TO ROUGHER MEASURES
WHERE THE HOUSES WERE FARTHER APART WITH GARDENS OR LITTLE FIELDS BETWEEN THEM COULD SEE THE EVENING SKY STILL BETTER AND HEARD THE SOUND OF THE BELL MUCH MORE DISTINCTLY IT WAS AS IF THE TONES CAME FROM A CHURCH IN THE STILL FOREST PEOPLE LOOKED THITHERWARD
FOR OTHERWISE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE COME THE OTHER WAS A POOR BOY WHO HAD BORROWED HIS COAT AND BOOTS TO BE CONFIRMED IN FROM THE INNKEEPER'S SON
BUT THE POOR CHILD THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WAS QUITE ASHAMED HE LOOKED AT HIS WOODEN SHOES PULLED AT THE SHORT SLEEVES OF HIS JACKET AND SAID THAT HE WAS AFRAID HE COULD NOT WALK SO FAST BESIDES HE THOUGHT THAT THE BELL MUST BE LOOKED FOR TO THE RIGHT
SO THEY COULD BE CARRIED IN THE UPPER COAT POCKET SHOWING A GLEAM OF LIGHT AND LEAVING THE HANDS FREE FOR USE OUT OF THE TENTS RUSHED THE YOUNG MEN TO FIND PROFESSOR BUMPER AND MISTER DAMON BEFORE THEM THE TWO MEN HAD CLUBS AND WERE STRIKING ABOUT IN THE HALF DARKNESS
AND IN THE TONE OF VOICE IN WHICH THEY WERE SAID WHICH DIAMOND FELT TO BE UGLY SO THEY DID NOT EVEN STICK TO HIM NOT TO SAY GET INSIDE HIM HE NEVER TOOK ANY NOTICE OF THEM
AND WOOD AND SEA
AND THEN HE CALLED TO THE PADDLERS TO INCREASE THEIR STROKES THE JOURNEY UP THE RIVER WAS NOT VERY EVENTFUL MANY ALLIGATORS WERE SEEN AND TOM AND NED SHOT SEVERAL WITH THE ELECTRIC RIFLE TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE THIRD DAY'S TRAVEL THERE WAS A CRY FROM ONE OF THE REAR BOATS
HIS MOTHER HOWEVER WAS A LITTLE SHY OF THE COMPANY FOR HIM AND BESIDES SHE COULD NOT ALWAYS SPARE HIM ALSO HIS FATHER LIKED TO HAVE HIM HIMSELF WHEN HE COULD SO THAT HE WAS MORE DESIRED THAN ENJOYED AMONG THE CABMEN
AND SAID THE BELL SOUNDED LIKE THE VOICE OF A MOTHER TO A GOOD DEAR CHILD AND THAT NO MELODY WAS SWEETER THAN THE TONES OF THE BELL THE KING OF THE COUNTRY WAS ALSO OBSERVANT OF IT AND VOWED THAT HE WHO COULD DISCOVER WHENCE THE SOUNDS PROCEEDED
THEN HE SAT ON HIS CROUP AND DID HIS BACK AND SIDES
AS HE AND TOM AROSE IN THE GRAY DAWN OF THE MORNING WHEN JACINTO ANNOUNCED THE BREAKFAST WHICH THE INDIAN COOK HAD PREPARED THAT WAS SOME NIGHT IF THIS IS A SAMPLE OF THE WILDS OF HONDURAS GIVE ME THE TAMENESS OF SHOPTON
ONE OF THEM LIFTED HIM DOWN AND FROM THAT TIME HE WAS A GREATER FAVOURITE THAN BEFORE AND IF EVER THERE WAS A BOY WHO HAD A CHANCE OF BEING A PRODIGY AT CAB DRIVING DIAMOND WAS THAT BOY FOR THE STRIFE CAME TO BE WHO SHOULD HAVE HIM OUT WITH HIM ON THE BOX
I RATHER THINK THEY'VE GONE BACK WAS THE PROFESSOR'S DRY COMMENT GONE BACK YES THE INDIANS SEEM TO HAVE DESERTED US AT THE ENDING OF THIS STAGE OF OUR JOURNEY BLESS MY TIME TABLE CRIED MISTER DAMON YOU DON'T SAY SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN
THIS HE HAD DONE AND WAS NOW GOING ON IN WOODEN SHOES AND IN HIS HUMBLE DRESS FOR THE BELL SOUNDED WITH SO DEEP A TONE AND WITH SUCH STRANGE POWER THAT PROCEED HE MUST
SHE TOLD THE CABMAN AND AWAY THEY DROVE WHEN THEY REACHED THE HOUSE DIAMOND'S FATHER GOT DOWN AND RANG THE BELL
THEY WERE JUST CLEARING THE RUBBISH AWAY DIAMOND'S FATHER TURNED AND MADE FOR CHARING CROSS THAT NIGHT THE FATHER AND MOTHER HAD A GREAT DEAL TO TALK ABOUT POOR THINGS SAID THE MOTHER IT'S WORSE FOR THEM THAN IT IS FOR US
PROFESSOR BUMPER ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD SEE TO IT THAT THE MAN'S FAMILY DID NOT WANT AND THIS SEEMED TO GIVE GENERAL SATISFACTION ESPECIALLY TO A BROTHER WHO WAS WITH THE PARTY ASIDE FROM BEING CAUGHT IN A DRENCHING STORM AND ONE OR TWO MINOR ACCIDENTS
HE CURRIED AND HE BRUSHED FIRST AT ONE SIDE OF HIS NECK AND THEN AT THE OTHER WHEN THAT WAS DONE HE ASKED FOR A DRESSING COMB AND COMBED HIS MANE THOROUGHLY THEN HE PUSHED HIMSELF ON TO HIS BACK
SO HE WAS QUITE PLEASED AND PROUD AND PERHAPS SAID TO HIMSELF SOMETHING LIKE THIS I'M A STUPID OLD HORSE WHO CAN'T BRUSH HIS OWN COAT BUT THERE'S MY YOUNG GODSON ON MY BACK CLEANING ME LIKE AN ANGEL I WON'T VOUCH FOR WHAT THE OLD HORSE WAS THINKING
SAID HIS MOTHER SHE HAD RINGS ON HER FINGERS ANYHOW RETURNED DIAMOND OF COURSE SHE HAD AS ANY LADY WOULD WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT WHEN WE WERE DOWN AT SANDWICH SAID DIAMOND YOU SAID YOU WOULD HAVE TO PART WITH YOUR MOTHER'S RING NOW WE WERE POOR
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD GOT A CAB WELL YOU SEE MA'AM I HAD A CHANCE OF BUYING THE OLD HORSE AND I COULDN'T RESIST HIM
AND THE WORDS CHOKED THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY GOT ANY FARTHER WHEN THEY TALKED TO HIM NICELY HE HAD ALWAYS A GOOD ANSWER SOMETIMES A SMART ONE READY AND THAT HELPED MUCH TO MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT HIM
COME BACK AGAIN CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SKIN I HOPE NOT I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BATS AND MOSQUITOES HE ADDED AS HE SLAPPED AT HIS FACE AND NECK INDEED THE PARTY OF WHITES WERE SET UPON BY THE NIGHT INSECTS TO SUCH AN EXTENT
THAT'S THE SHADOW LOOK OUT AND HE HELD UP HIS HANDS INSTINCTIVELY TO SHIELD HIS FACE SHADOW YELLED TOM UNCONSCIOUSLY ADDING TO THE DIN THAT SEEMED TO PERVADE EVERY PART OF THE CAMP THAT ISN'T A SHADOW IT'S SUBSTANCE IT'S A MONSTER BAT
DIAMOND'S FATHER TURNED INSTANTLY FOR HE WAS THE FOREMOST IN THE RANK AND FOLLOWED THE GIRL ONE OR TWO OTHER PASSING CABS HEARD THE CRY AND MADE FOR THE PLACE BUT THE GIRL HAD TAKEN CARE NOT TO CALL TILL SHE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO GIVE HER FRIENDS THE FIRST CHANCE
FROM CHILDREN THEY BECOME ALL AT ONCE GROWN UP PERSONS IT WAS AS IF THEIR INFANT SOULS WERE NOW TO FLY ALL AT ONCE INTO PERSONS WITH MORE UNDERSTANDING THE SUN WAS SHINING GLORIOUSLY THE CHILDREN THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WENT OUT OF THE TOWN
THE BATS FLEW BACK TO THE JUNGLE WHENCE THEY HAD EMERGED WE ARE SAFE FOR THE PRESENT EXCLAIMED JACINTO WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
I WILL CLIMB UP YONDER ROCK AND HE SEIZED HOLD OF THE CREEPING PLANTS AND THE ROOTS OF TREES CLIMBED UP THE MOIST STONES WHERE THE WATER SNAKES WERE WRITHING AND THE TOADS WERE CROAKING
FOR IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHAT ANY OLD HORSE IS THINKING OH DEAR SAID DIAMOND WHEN HE HAD DONE I'M SO TIRED AND HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN AT FULL LENGTH ON OLD DIAMOND'S BACK BY THIS TIME ALL THE MEN IN THE STABLE WERE GATHERED ABOUT THE TWO DIAMONDS AND ALL MUCH AMUSED
THE BELL PEOPLE SAID THE EVENING BELL IS SOUNDING THE SUN IS SETTING FOR A STRANGE WONDROUS TONE WAS HEARD IN THE NARROW STREETS OF A LARGE TOWN IT WAS LIKE THE SOUND OF A CHURCH BELL BUT IT WAS ONLY HEARD FOR A MOMENT
SHOULD HAVE THE TITLE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER EVEN IF IT WERE NOT REALLY A BELL MANY PERSONS NOW WENT TO THE WOOD FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE PLACE
THOUGH SEARCH WAS MADE FOR IT THE ACCIDENT CAST A LITTLE DAMPER OVER THE PARTY
THE RED COLORS ABOVE FADED AWAY AS THE SUN VANISHED BUT A MILLION STARS WERE LIGHTED A MILLION LAMPS SHONE
SUNG HIS EVENING HYMN AND SAID I CANNOT FIND WHAT I SEEK THE SUN IS GOING DOWN AND NIGHT IS COMING THE DARK DARK NIGHT YET PERHAPS I MAY BE ABLE ONCE MORE TO SEE THE ROUND RED SUN BEFORE HE ENTIRELY DISAPPEARS
BUT THE DEEP SOUND OF THE BELL ROSE LOUDER IT WAS ALMOST AS IF AN ORGAN WERE ACCOMPANYING IT AND THE TONES CAME FROM THE LEFT HAND THE SIDE WHERE THE HEART IS PLACED A RUSTLING WAS HEARD IN THE BUSHES AND A LITTLE BOY STOOD BEFORE THE KING'S SON
FOR THE ROLLING OF THE CARRIAGES AND THE VOICES OF THE MULTITUDE MADE TOO GREAT A NOISE
AS IF IT WOULD SHOWER DOWN ALL ITS BLESSINGS ON THE ROOF WHERE ROSES WERE BLOOMING THE LONG STEMS TWINED ROUND THE GABLE ON WHICH THERE HUNG A SMALL BELL WAS IT THAT WHICH PEOPLE HAD HEARD YES EVERYBODY WAS UNANIMOUS ON THE SUBJECT EXCEPT ONE
BUT TWO OF THE YOUNGEST SOON GREW TIRED AND BOTH RETURNED TO TOWN TWO LITTLE GIRLS SAT DOWN AND TWINED GARLANDS SO THEY DID NOT GO EITHER AND WHEN THE OTHERS REACHED THE WILLOW TREE WHERE THE CONFECTIONER WAS THEY SAID NOW WE ARE THERE
AND SHE CAN'T BEAR THE MOTION OF THE OMNIBUSES INDEED WE MEANT TO WALK A BIT FIRST BEFORE WE TOOK A CAB BUT JUST AT THE CORNER FOR AS HOT AS THE SUN WAS A COLD WIND CAME DOWN THE STREET AND I SAW THAT MISS COLEMAN MUST NOT FACE IT
AND THE RICH PEOPLE DROVE OUT AND THE POOR WALKED BUT THE WAY SEEMED STRANGELY LONG TO THEM AND WHEN THEY CAME TO A CLUMP OF WILLOWS WHICH GREW ON THE SKIRTS OF THE FOREST THEY SAT DOWN
HE CAUGHT UP HIS CAMERA TRIPOD WHICH WAS NEAR HIS COT AND MADE A SWING WITH IT AT THE CREATURE THAT HAD FLOWN INTO THE TENT THROUGH AN OPENING IT HAD MADE FOR ITSELF LOOK OUT YELLED NED IF IT'S A VAMPIRE IT'LL IT WON'T DO ANYTHING TO ME SHOUTED TOM AS HE STRUCK THE CREATURE
AND SPOILT ONES TOO MISSUS COLEMAN IS NONE SO POOR AS ALL THAT YET NO THANK HEAVEN SHE'S NOT COME TO THAT IS IT A GREAT DISGRACE TO BE POOR ASKED DIAMOND BECAUSE OF THE TONE IN WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SPOKEN
IT'S CHANGED TIMES FOR BOTH OF US JOSEPH AND IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN WE CAN HAVE A CAB EVEN
BUT MAYHAP THEY MAY GET MORE LAW THAN THEY LIKE SOME DAY THEMSELVES
AND GIVE ANOTHER TO THE OLD WATERMAN HE LEFT DIAMOND ON THE BOX A SUDDEN NOISE GOT UP AND DIAMOND LOOKED ROUND TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER
I'M AFRAID HE WAS RATHER A FALSE FRIEND WAS THE PROFESSOR'S ANSWER
SAW A WEIRD SIGHT CIRCLING AND WHEELING ABOUT IN THE CAMP CLEARING WERE MANY OF THE BLACK SHADOWY FORMS THAT HAD CAUSED NED SUCH ALARM GREAT BATS THEY WERE AND A DANGEROUS SPECIES IF JACINTO WAS TO BE BELIEVED
AND DRAGGING HER BROOM AFTER HER AND FROM THAT BY DEGREES HE RECALLED THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WHEN HE GOT DOWN FROM NORTH WIND'S BACK IN A LONDON STREET BUT HE COULD NOT QUITE SATISFY HIMSELF WHETHER THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS NOT A DREAM WHICH HE HAD DREAMED WHEN HE WAS A VERY LITTLE BOY
FOR ONE THING HE NEVER GOT FRIGHTENED AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS NEVER IN TOO GREAT A HURRY YET WHEN THE MOMENT CAME FOR DOING SOMETHING SHARP HE WAS ALWAYS READY FOR IT I MUST ONCE MORE REMIND MY READERS THAT HE HAD BEEN TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
WHEN THEY REACHED THE CURBSTONE WHO SHOULD IT BE WAITING FOR THE CAB BUT MISSUS AND MISS COLEMAN THEY DID NOT LOOK AT THE CABMAN HOWEVER
IN THE VAST CHURCH OF NATURE AND OF POETRY WHILE OVER THEM SOUNDED THE INVISIBLE HOLY BELL
AND IN THE GLEAM OF IT HE AND NED SAW FLUTTERING ABOUT THE TENT SOME DARK SHADOW LIKE FORM AT THE SIGHT OF WHICH TOM'S CHUM CRIED
FOR HE WAS AN EXCELLENT AND RESOLUTE YOUTH
I CERTAINLY AM IF THERE'S A FIGHT
THOUGH TO BE SURE SAID DIAMOND'S FATHER WITH WHAT TRUTH I CANNOT SAY BUT HE BELIEVED WHAT HE SAID SOME LADIES IS VERY HARD AND KEEPS YOU TO THE BARE SIXPENCE A MILE WHEN EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT AIN'T ENOUGH TO KEEP A FAMILY AND A CAB UPON TO BE SURE IT'S THE LAW
BUT WHETHER THE SOUND CAME FROM HIS HEAD OR FROM THE HOLLOW TREE THAT NO ONE COULD SAY WITH CERTAINTY SO NOW HE GOT THE PLACE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER AND WROTE YEARLY A SHORT TREATISE ON THE OWL
A BOY IN WOODEN SHOES AND WITH SO SHORT A JACKET THAT ONE COULD SEE WHAT LONG WRISTS HE HAD BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THE BOY WAS THAT ONE AMONG THE CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT COME BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO HOME AND RETURN HIS JACKET AND BOOTS TO THE INNKEEPER'S SON
HERE YOU HAVE A LIGHT LIKE MINE FLASH IT ON AND HANG IT SOMEWHERE ON YOURSELF THEN GET A CLUB AND COME ON THE LIGHTS WILL BLIND THE BATS AND WE CAN SEE TO HIT EM TOM'S PLAN SEEMED TO BE A GOOD ONE HIS LAMP AND NED'S HAD SMALL HOOKS ON THEM
SKYBLUE TULIPS WHICH SHONE AS THEY WAVED IN THE WINDS AND APPLE TREES THE APPLES OF WHICH LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE LARGE SOAPBUBBLES SO ONLY THINK HOW THE TREES MUST HAVE SPARKLED IN THE SUNSHINE AROUND THE NICEST GREEN MEADS
ONE DAY WHICH WAS NEITHER WASHING DAY NOR CLEANING DAY NOR MARKETING DAY NOR SATURDAY NOR MONDAY UPON WHICH CONSEQUENTLY DIAMOND COULD BE SPARED FROM THE BABY HIS FATHER TOOK HIM ON HIS OWN CAB
FOR NOBODY WENT FAR ENOUGH THAT ONE NOT FURTHER THAN THE OTHERS HOWEVER HE SAID THAT THE SOUND PROCEEDED FROM A VERY LARGE OWL IN A HOLLOW TREE A SORT OF LEARNED OWL THAT CONTINUALLY KNOCKED ITS HEAD AGAINST THE BRANCHES
WE SHALL HAVE TO LIGHT FIRES TO KEEP THEM AWAY IF WE CAN SUCCEED EVERY ONE GRAB UP A CLUB AND STRIKE HARD COME ON CRIED TOM GETTING ON SOME CLOTHES BY THE LIGHT OF HIS GLEAMING ELECTRIC LIGHT WHICH HE HAD SET ON HIS COT YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT THERE ARE YOU ASKED NED
YOU SEE THEY'VE BEEN USED TO SUCH GRAND THINGS AND FOR THEM TO COME DOWN TO A LITTLE POKY HOUSE LIKE THAT IT BREAKS MY HEART TO THINK OF IT I DON'T KNOW SAID DIAMOND THOUGHTFULLY WHETHER MISSUS COLEMAN HAD BELLS ON HER TOES
THEY MAY THERE IS NO TELLING BLESS MY SPEEDOMETER CRIED MISTER DAMON IF THOSE BEASTS OR BIRDS WHATEVER THEY ARE COME BACK I'LL GO AND HIDE IN THE RIVER AND TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THE ALLIGATORS
WHY IS THAT WHY PERSISTED DIAMOND
FROM THEN ON WE TRAVEL BY LAND UNTIL WELL UNTIL YOU GET TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE GOING I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS HE ADDED NODDING TOWARD THE PROFESSOR I AM LEAVING THAT PART TO YOU OH I HAVE A MAP SHOWING WHERE I WANT TO BEGIN SOME EXCAVATIONS WAS THE ANSWER
THOUGH WE HAD HARD ENOUGH WORK IN THAT TUNNEL DIGGING AFTER BREAKFAST WHILE THE INDIANS WERE MAKING READY THE CANOES PROFESSOR BUMPER WHO IN A PREVIOUS VISIT TO CENTRAL AMERICA HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT MADE A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF SOME OF THE DEAD BATS
HE RECALLED ANOTHER THING THAT HAD HAPPENED THAT MORNING WHICH ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED A MERE ACCIDENT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN DIAMOND GOES ON DIAMOND BECAME A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH ALL THE MEN ABOUT THE MEWS SOME MAY THINK IT WAS NOT THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR HIM TO BE BROUGHT UP IN BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THERE HE WAS
AT FIRST HE HEARD A GOOD MANY ROUGH AND BAD WORDS BUT HE DID NOT LIKE THEM AND SO THEY DID HIM LITTLE HARM HE DID NOT KNOW IN THE LEAST WHAT THEY MEANT
THEY DREW UP IN THE ROW UPON THE STAND BETWEEN COCKSPUR STREET AND PALL MALL THEY WAITED A LONG TIME BUT NOBODY SEEMED TO WANT TO BE CARRIED ANYWHERE BY AND BY LADIES WOULD BE GOING HOME FROM THE ACADEMY EXHIBITION AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A CHANCE OF A JOB
BUT PRESENTLY HIS FATHER CAME BACK AND MISSING DIAMOND LOOKED ABOUT
I DON'T KNOW BUT JACINTO IS YELLING SOMETHING ABOUT VAMPIRES VAMPIRES
ALL THE TIME THE OLD HORSE WENT ON EATING HIS HAY AND BUT WITH AN OCCASIONAL WHISK OF HIS TAIL WHEN DIAMOND TICKLED OR SCRATCHED HIM TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE PROCEEDING BUT THAT WAS ALL A PRETENCE FOR HE KNEW VERY WELL WHO IT WAS THAT WAS PERCHED ON HIS BACK AND RUBBING AWAY AT HIM WITH THE COMB AND THE BRUSH
I DO NOT THINK THIS LOT WILL COME BACK WE HAVE KILLED TOO MANY OF THEM
WHEN THEY FOUND THE WAY BLOCKED UP AND UPON INQUIRY WERE INFORMED THAT A STACK OF CHIMNEYS HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN IN THE NIGHT
IN WHICH WHITE SWANS WERE SWIMMING AND BEAT THE AIR WITH THEIR WINGS THE KING'S SON OFTEN STOOD STILL AND LISTENED HE THOUGHT THE BELL SOUNDED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THESE STILL LAKES BUT THEN HE REMARKED AGAIN THAT THE TONE PROCEEDED NOT FROM THERE
OH WE'VE GONE THROUGH WITH WORSE THAN THIS LAUGHED TOM IT'S ALL IN THE DAY'S WORK WE'VE ONLY GOT STARTED
NOBODY KNOWS THE SENSE IN THAT HEAD OF HIS THE TWO LADIES WENT NEAR TO PAT THE HORSE AND THEN THEY NOTICED DIAMOND ON THE BOX WHY YOU'VE GOT BOTH DIAMONDS WITH YOU SAID MISS COLEMAN HOW DO YOU DO DIAMOND DIAMOND LIFTED HIS CAP AND ANSWERED POLITELY
LIKE A PRIMROSE IN A HAILSTORM AT FIRST BECAUSE HIS FACE WAS SO QUIET AND SWEET WITH A SMILE ALWAYS EITHER AWAKE OR ASLEEP IN HIS EYES AND BECAUSE HE NEVER HEEDED THEIR UGLY WORDS AND ROUGH JOKES THEY SAID HE WASN'T ALL THERE
BUT IT HAD SEEMED TO THEM AS IF IT HAD COME FROM THE TOWN
THEY WERE EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE SOME ALMOST AS BIG AS HAWKS AND WERE OF THE SUB FAMILY DESMODIDAE THE SCIENTIST SAID THIS IS A TRUE BLOOD SUCKING BAT WENT ON THE PROFESSOR THIS AND HE POINTED TO THE NOSE LEAVES IS THE SUCKING APPARATUS
ALL NATURE WAS A VAST HOLY CHURCH IN WHICH THE TREES AND THE BUOYANT CLOUDS WERE THE PILLARS FLOWERS AND GRASS THE VELVET CARPETING AND HEAVEN ITSELF THE LARGE CUPOLA
I SEE OBSERVED TOM CALMLY HAND ME THE RIFLE NED TOM TOOK QUICK AIM AND PULLED THE TRIGGER THE EXPLOSIVE ELECTRIC BULLET WENT TRUE TO ITS MARK AND THE GREAT ANIMAL TURNED OVER IN A DEATH STRUGGLE
NOTHING ELSE OF MOMENT MARKED THE REMAINDER OF THE RIVER JOURNEY AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD DAY THE CANOES PULLED TO SHORE AND A NIGHT CAMP WAS MADE BUT WHERE ARE THE MULES WE ARE TO USE IN TRAVELING TO MORROW ASKED THE PROFESSOR OF JACINTO IN THE NEXT VILLAGE
APPEARED IN HIS WOODEN SHOES AND JACKET THE POOR BOY WHO HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WITH HIM HE HAD FOLLOWED HIS OWN PATH AND HAD REACHED THE SPOT JUST AS SOON AS THE SON OF THE KING HAD DONE THEY RAN TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND STOOD TOGETHER HAND IN HAND
BUT A HELPLESS QUADRUPED HAS NOT THOUGH IF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THESE BATS ATTACKED A MAN AT THE SAME TIME HE WOULD HAVE SMALL CHANCE TO ESCAPE ALIVE THEIR BITES TOO MAY BE POISONOUS FOR ALL I KNOW
THEN TOM NOTICED SOMETHING QUEER THE CANOES WERE NOT ON THE RIVER BANK THERE WAS NOT AN INDIAN IN SIGHT AND NO EVIDENCE OF JACINTO WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAVE THE OTHERS GONE ON AHEAD
FOR A TIME IT SEEMED AS IF THE BATS WOULD FAIRLY OVERWHELM THE CAMP SO MANY OF THEM WERE THERE BUT THE INCREASING LIGHTS AND THE ATTACKS MADE BY THE INDIANS AND THE WHITE TRAVELERS TURNED THE TIDE OF BATTLE AND WITH SILENT FLAPPINGS OF THEIR SOFT VELVETY WINGS
HAVE YOU THOUGHT WHAT MAY BE IN THEM GREAT HEATHEN TEMPLES IDOLS PERHAPS FOR A MOMENT NONE OF THE PROFESSOR'S COMPANIONS SPOKE
HIS BREAST WAS FILLED MORE AND MORE WITH THE FOREST SOLITUDE BUT HE STILL HEARD THE LITTLE BELL WITH WHICH THE OTHERS WERE SO SATISFIED AND NOW AND THEN WHEN THE WIND BLEW HE COULD ALSO HEAR THE PEOPLE SINGING WHO WERE SITTING AT TEA WHERE THE CONFECTIONER HAD HIS TENT
FROM WITHOUT THE TENT CAME THE INDIAN CRIES OF OSHTOO OSHTOO MINGLED WITH THEM WERE CALLS OF JACINTO PARTLY IN SPANISH PARTLY IN THE INDIAN TONGUE AND PARTLY IN ENGLISH IT IS A RAID BY VAMPIRE BATS WAS ALL TOM AND NED COULD DISTINGUISH
FOR THAT WAS THE PLACE WHERE ALL SORTS OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS WERE TO BE FOUND BUT THERE WE SHALL NOT MEET SAID THE KING'S SON NODDING AT THE SAME TIME TO THE POOR BOY WHO WENT INTO THE DARKEST THICKEST PART OF THE WOOD WHERE THORNS TORE HIS HUMBLE DRESS
WE SHALL MARCH THERE IN THE MORNING NO USE TO GO THERE AT NIGHT WHEN ALL IS DARK I SUPPOSE THAT IS SO THE INDIANS MADE CAMP AS USUAL THE GOODS BEING BROUGHT FROM THE CANOES AND PILED UP NEAR THE TENTS THEN NIGHT SETTLED DOWN
WHAT IS IT WHAT'S THE MATTER CRIED TOM SPRINGING FROM HIS COT AND HASTENING TO THE SIDE OF HIS CHUM IN THE TENT
THEIR CLOTHES WOULD GET SO TORN LARGE BLOCKS OF STONE LAY THERE OVERGROWN WITH MOSS OF EVERY COLOR THE FRESH SPRING BUBBLED FORTH AND MADE A STRANGE GURGLING SOUND THAT SURELY CANNOT BE THE BELL SAID ONE OF THE CHILDREN LYING DOWN AND LISTENING
CAN KILL A HORSE OR AN OX IN A SHORT TIME BY SUCKING ITS BLOOD SO WHEN THE VILLAGERS FIND THEY ARE VISITED BY A COLONY OF THESE VAMPIRES THEY GET OUT TAKING THEIR LIVE STOCK WITH THEM AND STAY IN CAVES OR IN DENSELY WOODED PLACES UNTIL THE BATS FLY ON
AND FELT THEIR MINDS ATTUNED MOST SOLEMNLY A LONG TIME PASSED AND PEOPLE SAID TO EACH OTHER I WONDER IF THERE IS A CHURCH OUT IN THE WOOD THE BELL HAS A TONE THAT IS WONDROUS SWEET LET US STROLL THITHER AND EXAMINE THE MATTER NEARER
THE BAT MAKES AN OPENING IN THE SKIN WITH ITS SHARP TEETH AND PROCEEDS TO EXTRACT THE BLOOD I CAN WELL BELIEVE TWO OR THREE OF THEM ATTACKING A STEER OR MULE AT ONCE COULD SOON WEAKEN IT SO THE ANIMAL WOULD DIE AND A MAN TOO ASKED NED
IT WON'T DO TO HAVE A HORSE'S BELLY CLEAN AND HIS BACK DIRTY YOU KNOW GIVE ME A LEG SAID DIAMOND AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS ON THE OLD HORSE'S BACK WITH THE COMB AND BRUSH HE SAT ON HIS WITHERS AND REACHING FORWARD AS HE ATE HIS HAY
AFTER THAT WELL WE SHALL TRUST TO LUCK FOR WHAT WE SHALL FIND THERE ARE SAID TO BE MANY CURIOUS THINGS WENT ON JACINTO SPEAKING AS THOUGH HE HAD NO INTEREST
THERE WERE THREE PERSONS WHO ASSERTED THEY HAD PENETRATED TO THE END OF THE FOREST
FOR NOW THE INDIANS HAD SET SEVERAL FIRES AGLOW AND IN THE GLEAMS CONSTANTLY GROWING BRIGHTER AS MORE FUEL WAS PILED ON
PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH THE ACCOUNT HE GAVE OF THE CAUSE OF HIS BEING IN A FRAY I COULDN'T LET THEM BEHAVE SO TO A POOR GIRL COULD I FATHER HE SAID CERTAINLY NOT DIAMOND SAID HIS FATHER QUITE PLEASED FOR DIAMOND'S FATHER WAS A GENTLEMAN
ONE DAY JACK GAVE HIM A CURRY COMB AND A BRUSH TO TRY HIS HAND UPON OLD DIAMOND'S COAT HE USED THEM SO DEFTLY SO GENTLY AND YET SO THOROUGHLY AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH THAT THE MAN COULD NOT HELP ADMIRING HIM YOU MUST MAKE HASTE AND GROW HE SAID
AND FROM THE WOOD WAS BORNE TOWARDS THEM THE SOUNDS OF THE UNKNOWN BELL WITH WONDERFUL DISTINCTNESS THEY ALL IMMEDIATELY FELT A WISH TO GO THITHER ALL EXCEPT THREE ONE OF THEM HAD TO GO HOME TO TRY ON A BALL DRESS
AND FANCIED THEY WERE NOW IN THE DEPTH OF THE GREEN WOOD THE CONFECTIONER OF THE TOWN CAME OUT AND SET UP HIS BOOTH THERE AND SOON AFTER CAME ANOTHER CONFECTIONER
THIS MUST BE LOOKED TO SO HE REMAINED AND LET THE OTHERS GO ON WITHOUT HIM THEY AFTERWARDS CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE MADE OF BRANCHES AND THE BARK OF TREES A LARGE WILD APPLE TREE BENT OVER IT
THE CITY CARPENTERS HAD ERECTED SCAFFOLDS UPON WHICH THE INVITED LADIES WERE TO BE PLACED THE CITY GROCER HAD ORNAMENTED THE CHAMBERS WITH TWO HUNDRED FLAMBEAUX OF WHITE WAX A PIECE OF LUXURY UNHEARD OF AT THAT PERIOD
A HORSE FOR YOUR LACKEY RESUMED THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE HESITATINGLY
HE WAS ABOUT TO SEE IN REALITY A CERTAIN COFFER OF WHICH HE HAD TWENTY TIMES BEHELD THE IMAGE IN HIS DREAMS A COFFER LONG AND DEEP LOCKED BOLTED FASTENED IN THE WALL A COFFER OF WHICH HE HAD SO OFTEN HEARD
THAT'S WELL AS REGARDS MY HORSE BUT I MUST HAVE THE APPOINTMENTS COMPLETE AS THEY INCLUDE OBJECTS WHICH A MUSKETEER ALONE CAN PURCHASE AND WHICH WILL NOT AMOUNT BESIDES TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED LIVRES
THE TIME FOR WINE CAME
WHY MADAME HAVE YOU NOT THOUGHT PROPER TO WEAR YOUR DIAMOND STUDS WHEN YOU KNOW IT WOULD GIVE ME SO MUCH GRATIFICATION THE QUEEN CAST A GLANCE AROUND HER AND SAW THE CARDINAL BEHIND WITH A DIABOLICAL SMILE ON HIS COUNTENANCE
ON THE EVENING BEFORE THEY HAD SCARCELY SEEN EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT AT THE APARTMENT OF THE SWISS GUARD GERMAIN WHITHER D'ARTAGNAN HAD SENT FOR HER
AND TWENTY VIOLINS WERE ORDERED AND THE PRICE FOR THEM FIXED AT DOUBLE THE USUAL RATE UPON CONDITION SAID THE REPORT THAT THEY SHOULD BE PLAYED ALL NIGHT
AND THE CLOCK OF SAINT JEAN HAD STRUCK THREE QUARTERS PAST TWO THE SOUND OF VOICES DIMINISHED BY DEGREES IN THE ADJOINING CHAMBER THE COMPANY WAS THEN HEARD DEPARTING THEN THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET IN WHICH D'ARTAGNAN WAS WAS OPENED
IN THEIR UTMOST NICETY AND WINNING FROM THEM BY WAY OF FEE FOR THE LESSON HE WOULD GIVE THEM IN AN HOUR THEIR SAVINGS OF A MONTH ALL THIS WAS ENORMOUSLY DELIGHTFUL TO PORTHOS
BE SATISFIED SAID THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE THERE REMAINS THE VALISE ADDED PORTHOS
BUT WITHDRAWING HIS ANXIOUS LOOK FROM THE CHEST AND FIXING IT UPON PORTHOS HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING MONSIEUR OUR COUSIN WILL DO US THE FAVOR OF DINING WITH US ONCE BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE FOR THE CAMPAIGN WILL HE NOT MADAME COQUENARD
MY HUSBAND HAS FIVE OR SIX VALISES YOU SHALL CHOOSE THE BEST THERE IS ONE IN PARTICULAR WHICH HE PREFERS IN HIS JOURNEYS LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD ALL THE WORLD YOUR VALISE IS THEN EMPTY ASKED PORTHOS WITH SIMPLICITY
BEFORE ENTERING HIS CLOSET THE KING DESIRED TO BE INFORMED THE MOMENT THE CARDINAL ARRIVED HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE ENTRANCE OF THE KING FRESH ACCLAMATIONS WERE HEARD THESE ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF THE QUEEN
HIS HEART BEAT BUT NOT LIKE D'ARTAGNAN'S WITH A YOUNG AND IMPATIENT LOVE NO A MORE MATERIAL INTEREST STIRRED HIS BLOOD HE WAS ABOUT AT LAST TO PASS THAT MYSTERIOUS THRESHOLD
HE SOON DISTINGUISHED HER VOICE FROM THE OTHERS AT FIRST BY A SLIGHTLY FOREIGN ACCENT AND NEXT BY THAT TONE OF DOMINATION NATURALLY IMPRESSED UPON ALL ROYAL WORDS HE HEARD HER APPROACH AND WITHDRAW FROM THE PARTIALLY OPEN DOOR
PORTHOS KNOCKED WITH HIS HAND A TALL PALE CLERK HIS FACE SHADED BY A FOREST OF VIRGIN HAIR OPENED THE DOOR AND BOWED WITH THE AIR OF A MAN FORCED AT ONCE TO RESPECT IN ANOTHER LOFTY STATURE WHICH INDICATED STRENGTH
AND MONSIEUR AND THE OTHER NOBLES WERE DRESSED LIKE HIM THIS WAS THE COSTUME THAT BEST BECAME THE KING SO DRESSED HE REALLY APPEARED THE FIRST GENTLEMAN OF HIS KINGDOM
PORTHOS LOOKED AT THE BOTTLE WHICH WAS NEAR HIM AND HOPED THAT WITH WINE BREAD AND CHEESE HE MIGHT MAKE A DINNER BUT WINE WAS WANTING THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTY
FREQUENTLY CAST HIS EYES WITH GREAT UNEASINESS UPON A LARGE CHEST PLACED IN FRONT OF HIS OAK DESK PORTHOS COMPREHENDED THAT THIS CHEST ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT CORRESPOND IN SHAPE WITH THAT WHICH HE HAD SEEN IN HIS DREAMS MUST BE THE BLESSED COFFER
WITH THESE WORDS HE HELD OUT TO THE QUEEN THE TWO STUDS THE CARDINAL HAD GIVEN HIM HOW SIRE CRIED THE YOUNG QUEEN AFFECTING SURPRISE YOU ARE GIVING ME THEN TWO MORE I SHALL HAVE FOURTEEN
WHOM PORTHOS ASSISTED IN ROLLING HER HUSBAND UP TO THE TABLE
THEN CONTINUED HE THERE IS A HORSE FOR MY LACKEY AND MY VALISE
AN ILL SMELLING DARK PASSAGE A STAIRCASE HALF LIGHTED BY BARS THROUGH WHICH STOLE A GLIMMER FROM A NEIGHBORING YARD ON THE FIRST FLOOR A LOW DOOR STUDDED WITH ENORMOUS NAILS
THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE HAD BEEN ON THE WATCH EVER SINCE MIDDAY RECKONING THAT THE HEART OR PERHAPS THE STOMACH OF HER LOVER WOULD BRING HIM BEFORE HIS TIME
IT IS MY COUSIN CRIED THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE COME IN COME IN MONSIEUR PORTHOS THE NAME OF PORTHOS PRODUCED ITS EFFECT UPON THE CLERKS WHO BEGAN TO LAUGH BUT PORTHOS TURNED SHARPLY ROUND
THE VOICE OF THE KING WAS TREMULOUS WITH ANGER EVERYBODY LOOKED AND LISTENED WITH ASTONISHMENT COMPREHENDING NOTHING OF WHAT PASSED SIRE SAID THE QUEEN
AND TWICE OR THREE TIMES HE EVEN SAW THE SHADOW OF A PERSON INTERCEPT THE LIGHT AT LENGTH A HAND AND AN ARM SURPASSINGLY BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR FORM AND WHITENESS GLIDED THROUGH THE TAPESTRY
THIS SUCCOR WHICH CAME TO PORTHOS AT THE MOMENT IN WHICH HE WAS ATTACKED IN HIS GASTRONOMIC HOPES INSPIRED MUCH GRATITUDE IN THE MUSKETEER TOWARD THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE THE HOUR OF DINNER SOON ARRIVED
AND WHICH FORBADE HIM EVEN TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST COMPLAINT AT LENGTH AFTER WINDING ABOUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
AND THEY REQUIRE MANY THINGS USELESS TO THE GUARDSMEN OR THE SWISS BUT YET DETAIL THEM TO ME WHY THEY MAY AMOUNT TO SAID PORTHOS WHO PREFERRED DISCUSSING THE TOTAL TO TAKING THEM ONE BY ONE
THE KING OPENED IT AND FOUND IN IT TWO DIAMOND STUDS WHAT DOES THIS MEAN DEMANDED HE OF THE CARDINAL NOTHING REPLIED THE LATTER ONLY IF THE QUEEN HAS THE STUDS WHICH I VERY MUCH DOUBT COUNT THEM SIRE
ON THE SURFACE OF WHICH A FEW CRUSTS SWAM ABOUT AS RARE AS THE ISLANDS OF AN ARCHIPELAGO
AFTER THE SOUP THE MAID BROUGHT A BOILED FOWL A PIECE OF MAGNIFICENCE WHICH CAUSED THE EYES OF THE DINERS TO DILATE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY SEEMED READY TO BURST
THE CARDINAL WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE AND THE KING WAS VERY PALE THE KING MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD WITHOUT A MASK AND THE RIBBONS OF HIS DOUBLET SCARCELY TIED HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE QUEEN AND IN AN ALTERED VOICE SAID
AT THIS MOMENT THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM UNCLOSED WITH A CREAK AND PORTHOS PERCEIVED THROUGH THE HALF OPEN FLAP THE LITTLE CLERK WHO NOT BEING ALLOWED TO TAKE PART IN THE FEAST ATE HIS DRY BREAD IN THE PASSAGE WITH THE DOUBLE ODOR OF THE DINING ROOM AND KITCHEN
THE KING THE QUEEN HIS EMINENCE AND HIMSELF THE QUEEN HAD JUST REGAINED HER CHAMBER AND D'ARTAGNAN WAS ABOUT TO RETIRE WHEN HE FELT HIS SHOULDER LIGHTLY TOUCHED HE TURNED AND SAW A YOUNG WOMAN WHO MADE HIM A SIGN TO FOLLOW HER
SMILED A LITTLE AND COLORED A GREAT DEAL
AS IT CAME IN SEARCH OF HIS HE ALSO DRANK HALF A GLASS OF THIS SPARINGLY SERVED WINE AND FOUND IT TO BE NOTHING BUT THAT HORRIBLE MONTREUIL THE TERROR OF ALL EXPERT PALATES
OH NO SAID PORTHOS IT DOES NOT EXCEED TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LIVRES I EVEN THINK THAT WITH ECONOMY I COULD MANAGE IT WITH TWO THOUSAND LIVRES GOOD GOD CRIED SHE TWO THOUSAND LIVRES
THE BLACK FEET OF THE FOWL AND THE ONLY MUTTON BONE ON WHICH THERE WAS THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF MEAT PORTHOS FANCIED THEY WERE MYSTIFYING HIM AND BEGAN TO CURL HIS MUSTACHE AND KNIT HIS EYEBROWS
YES MONSIEUR WE ARE COUSINS SAID PORTHOS WITHOUT BEING DISCONCERTED AS HE HAD NEVER RECKONED UPON BEING RECEIVED ENTHUSIASTICALLY BY THE HUSBAND BY THE FEMALE SIDE I BELIEVE SAID THE PROCURATOR MALICIOUSLY
THE SAME HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE QUEEN AND MADAME THE PRESIDENT THE NOBLES AND LADIES OF THEIR MAJESTIES SUITES WERE TO DRESS TWO BY TWO IN CHAMBERS PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE
TO WHICH IT HAD RETIRED TO DIE OF OLD AGE THE DEVIL THOUGHT PORTHOS THIS IS POOR WORK I RESPECT OLD AGE BUT I DON'T MUCH LIKE IT BOILED OR ROASTED
BUT QUICK AS A BIRD SHE GLIDED BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND WHEN HE WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER HER FINGER PLACED UPON HER MOUTH WITH A LITTLE IMPERATIVE GESTURE FULL OF GRACE REMINDED HIM THAT HE WAS UNDER THE COMMAND OF A POWER WHICH HE MUST BLINDLY OBEY
WELL AGREED FOR A PRETTY MULE SAID PORTHOS YOU ARE RIGHT I HAVE SEEN VERY GREAT SPANISH NOBLES WHOSE WHOLE SUITE WERE MOUNTED ON MULES BUT THEN YOU UNDERSTAND MADAME COQUENARD A MULE WITH FEATHERS AND BELLS
THE PROCURATOR HAD WITHOUT DOUBT BEEN WARNED OF HIS VISIT AS HE EXPRESSED NO SURPRISE AT THE SIGHT OF PORTHOS WHO ADVANCED TOWARD HIM WITH A SUFFICIENTLY EASY AIR AND SALUTED HIM COURTEOUSLY
FINALLY THE REST OF THE EQUIPMENT WAS SUCCESSIVELY DEBATED IN THE SAME MANNER
THE MUSKETEER COULD NOT FORGET THE EVIL REPORTS WHICH THEN PREVAILED AND WHICH INDEED HAVE SURVIVED THEM OF THE PROCURATORS OF THE PERIOD MEANNESS STINGINESS FASTS BUT AS AFTER ALL
THESE KEYS WERE GIVEN UP TO HIM INSTANTLY EACH OF THEM HAD TICKET ATTACHED TO IT BY WHICH IT MIGHT BE RECOGNIZED AND FROM THAT MOMENT THE SIEUR DE LA COSTE WAS CHARGED WITH THE CARE OF ALL THE DOORS AND ALL THE AVENUES
AND UPON A SIGN FROM HER EVERYONE EAGERLY TOOK HIS SEAT
TO WHOM ANNE OF AUSTRIA OWED THE EXTRAORDINARY TRIUMPH SHE HAD OBTAINED OVER THE CARDINAL AND WHO CONFOUNDED UNKNOWN LOST IN THE CROWD GATHERED AT ONE OF THE DOORS
BUT OF WHAT THEN DOES THE EQUIPMENT OF YOUR COMPANY CONSIST MONSIEUR PORTHOS OH OF MANY THINGS SAID PORTHOS THE MUSKETEERS ARE AS YOU KNOW PICKED SOLDIERS
THE QUEEN REMAINED FOR A SHORT TIME TO RECEIVE THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE CITY DIGNITARIES AND TO REPLY TO THE SALUTATIONS OF THE LADIES ALL AT ONCE THE KING APPEARED WITH THE CARDINAL AT ONE OF THE DOORS OF THE HALL
A STRIPLING OF A DOZEN YEARS RISING BEHIND THE THIRD IN ALL THREE CLERKS AND A HALF WHICH FOR THE TIME ARGUED A VERY EXTENSIVE CLIENTAGE ALTHOUGH THE MUSKETEER WAS NOT EXPECTED BEFORE ONE O'CLOCK
THAT IS WHAT YOU MEANT TO SAY YES DEAR MONSIEUR PORTHOS THUS FOR INSTANCE DON'T YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE WANT A HORSE YES A HORSE WELL THEN I CAN JUST SUIT YOU AH SAID PORTHOS BRIGHTENING
OH OH SAID HE HERE IS A SOUP WHICH IS RATHER INVITING WHAT THE DEVIL CAN THEY SMELL SO EXTRAORDINARY IN THIS SOUP SAID PORTHOS AT THE SIGHT OF A PALE LIQUID ABUNDANT BUT ENTIRELY FREE FROM MEAT
CUT OFF THE NECK WHICH WITH THE HEAD SHE PUT ON ONE SIDE FOR HERSELF RAISED THE WING FOR PORTHOS AND THEN RETURNED THE BIRD OTHERWISE INTACT TO THE SERVANT WHO HAD BROUGHT IT IN
MOVED BY A DOUBLE SENTIMENT LOVE AND CURIOSITY ALL THE WAY AND IN PROPORTION AS THE CORRIDORS BECAME MORE DESERTED D'ARTAGNAN WISHED TO STOP THE YOUNG WOMAN SEIZE HER AND GAZE UPON HER WERE IT ONLY FOR A MINUTE
AND TOOK FROM A BUFFET A PIECE OF CHEESE SOME PRESERVED QUINCES AND A CAKE WHICH SHE HAD HERSELF MADE OF ALMONDS AND HONEY
IN FACT THE KING COUNTED THEM AND THE TWELVE STUDS WERE ALL ON HER MAJESTY'S SHOULDER THE KING CALLED THE CARDINAL WHAT DOES THIS MEAN MONSIEUR CARDINAL ASKED THE KING IN A SEVERE TONE THIS MEANS SIRE REPLIED THE CARDINAL
AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORTHY LADY RELIEVED HIM FROM AN AWKWARD EMBARRASSMENT THE CLERKS SURVEYED HIM WITH GREAT CURIOSITY AND HE NOT KNOWING WELL WHAT TO SAY TO THIS ASCENDING AND DESCENDING SCALE REMAINED TONGUE TIED
THEN THE HAND WAS WITHDRAWN LEAVING IN HIS AN OBJECT WHICH HE PERCEIVED TO BE A RING THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY CLOSED AND D'ARTAGNAN FOUND HIMSELF AGAIN IN COMPLETE OBSCURITY D'ARTAGNAN PLACED THE RING ON HIS FINGER AND AGAIN WAITED
THE FACE OF THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS COVERED WITH A BLACK VELVET MASK BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS PRECAUTION WHICH WAS IN FACT TAKEN RATHER AGAINST OTHERS THAN AGAINST HIM HE AT ONCE RECOGNIZED HIS USUAL GUIDE THE LIGHT AND INTELLIGENT
THE LATTER WISHED TO DETAIN HIM BY DARTING CERTAIN TENDER GLANCES BUT PORTHOS URGED THE COMMANDS OF DUTY AND THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE PLACE TO THE KING
PORTHOS MADE A MOST SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE
WAS PREPARED IN THE LITTLE ROOM ON THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT JEAN IN FRONT OF THE SILVER BUFFET OF THE CITY WHICH WAS GUARDED BY FOUR ARCHERS AT MIDNIGHT GREAT CRIES AND LOUD ACCLAMATIONS WERE HEARD IT WAS THE KING
LAYING THE BLAME UPON THE CARDINAL WHO HAD DETAINED HIM TILL ELEVEN O'CLOCK TALKING OF AFFAIRS OF STATE HIS MAJESTY IN FULL DRESS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
BUT SOON A RAY OF LIGHT WHICH PENETRATED THROUGH THE CHAMBER TOGETHER WITH THE WARM AND PERFUMED AIR WHICH REACHED HIM FROM THE SAME APERTURE THE CONVERSATION OF TWO OF THREE LADIES IN LANGUAGE AT ONCE RESPECTFUL AND REFINED
THE PROCURATOR REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AH MADAME COQUENARD ACCEPT MY COMPLIMENTS YOUR DINNER HAS BEEN A REAL FEAST LORD HOW I HAVE EATEN
ENSIGN IN THE KING'S GUARDS FOLLOWED BY TWO OFFICERS AND SEVERAL ARCHERS OF THAT BODY CAME TO THE CITY REGISTRAR NAMED CLEMENT AND DEMANDED OF HIM ALL THE KEYS OF THE ROOMS AND OFFICES OF THE HOTEL
THIS IS FINE SAID PORTHOS TO HIMSELF I AM PRETTILY CAUGHT
THE KING TREMBLED WITH JOY AND THE CARDINAL WITH VEXATION
AND WHICH WERE ALL ILLUMINATED WITH COLORED LANTERNS
BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE SAW NOTHING BUT EAGER EYES WHICH WERE DEVOURING IN ANTICIPATION THAT SUBLIME FOWL WHICH WAS THE OBJECT OF HIS CONTEMPT
ADVANCED TO RECEIVE THEIR ILLUSTRIOUS GUEST THE QUEEN ENTERED THE GREAT HALL AND IT WAS REMARKED THAT LIKE THE KING SHE LOOKED DULL AND EVEN WEARY AT THE MOMENT SHE ENTERED THE CURTAIN OF A SMALL GALLERY WHICH TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN CLOSED
THEY PASSED INTO THE EATING ROOM A LARGE DARK ROOM SITUATED OPPOSITE THE KITCHEN THE CLERKS WHO AS IT APPEARED HAD SMELLED UNUSUAL PERFUMES IN THE HOUSE WERE OF MILITARY PUNCTUALITY
PORTHOS SMILED IT MAY BE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD THE SADDLE WHICH CAME FROM BUCKINGHAM
ON HIS PART THE KING RETURNED TO HIS APARTMENT THERE WAS A MOMENT OF TROUBLE AND CONFUSION IN THE ASSEMBLY EVERYBODY HAD REMARKED THAT SOMETHING HAD PASSED BETWEEN THE KING AND QUEEN BUT BOTH OF THEM HAD SPOKEN SO LOW THAT EVERYBODY
WHICH WAS ENTIRELY DARK AND LED D'ARTAGNAN INTO IT THERE SHE MADE A FRESH SIGN OF SILENCE AND OPENED A SECOND DOOR CONCEALED BY TAPESTRY THE OPENING OF THIS DOOR DISCLOSED A BRILLIANT LIGHT AND SHE DISAPPEARED
AH BUT THE VALISE I WANT CRIED PORTHOS IS A WELL FILLED ONE MY DEAR MADAME UTTERED FRESH SIGHS MOLIERE HAD NOT WRITTEN HIS SCENE IN L'AVARE THEN
THESE CONDITIONS BEING AGREED TO
THIS TIME PORTHOS RECEIVED THE BLOW RIGHT IN HIS STOMACH AND FELT IT
AND IN WHICH THEIR MAJESTIES WERE TO DANCE THE FAMOUS LA MERLAISON THE FAVORITE BALLET OF THE KING
THE MILITARY DRESS WHICH INDICATED RANK AND A RUDDY COUNTENANCE WHICH INDICATED FAMILIARITY WITH GOOD LIVING A SHORTER CLERK CAME BEHIND THE FIRST A TALLER CLERK BEHIND THE SECOND
THE QUEEN HAD THEM THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HAD SHE TEN OR TWELVE AT THAT MOMENT THE VIOLINS SOUNDED THE SIGNAL FOR THE BALLET THE KING ADVANCED TOWARD MADAME THE PRESIDENT WITH WHOM HE WAS TO DANCE
SERVED HIMSELF IN ABOUT THE SAME PROPORTION
AS NEXT TO THE QUEEN SHE WAS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PERSONAGE OF THE FETE SHE WAS RECEIVED BY THE CITY OFFICIALS AND PLACED IN A BOX OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH THE QUEEN WAS TO OCCUPY AT TEN O'CLOCK THE KING'S COLLATION CONSISTING OF PRESERVES AND OTHER DELICACIES
A PROCURATOR'S DINNER HOWEVER BRILLIANT HAD BEEN THE PART PLAYED BY PORTHOS IN THE DUEL IT HAD NOT MADE HIM FORGET THE DINNER OF THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE ON THE MORROW HE RECEIVED THE LAST TOUCHES OF MOUSQUETON'S BRUSH FOR AN HOUR
AND YET AT THE VERY DOOR THE MUSKETEER BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN SOME DOUBTS THE APPROACH WAS NOT SUCH AS TO PREPOSSESS PEOPLE
AND HELD THEIR STOOLS IN HAND QUITE READY TO SIT DOWN THEIR JAWS MOVED PRELIMINARILY WITH FEARFUL THREATENINGS INDEED THOUGHT PORTHOS CASTING A GLANCE AT THE THREE HUNGRY CLERKS
FOR THE ERRAND BOY AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED WAS NOT ADMITTED TO THE HONORS OF THE MAGISTERIAL TABLE IN MY COUSIN'S PLACE I WOULD NOT KEEP SUCH GOURMANDS THEY LOOK LIKE SHIPWRECKED SAILORS WHO HAVE NOT EATEN FOR SIX WEEKS
BUT THE KING TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE PRIVILEGE HE HAD OF LEAVING HIS LADY TO ADVANCE EAGERLY TOWARD THE QUEEN I THANK YOU MADAME SAID HE FOR THE DEFERENCE YOU HAVE SHOWN TO MY WISHES BUT I THINK YOU WANT TWO OF THE STUDS AND I BRING THEM BACK TO YOU
THAT WE MUST ENTREAT HIM TO GIVE US EVERY INSTANT HE CAN CALL HIS OWN PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE OH MY LEGS MY POOR LEGS WHERE ARE YOU MURMURED COQUENARD AND HE TRIED TO SMILE
AH MADAME SAID PORTHOS HAUGHTILY DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A BEGGAR NO
FELT THE WANT OF A SIESTA PORTHOS BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THE THING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT THE PRESENT SITTING AND IN THAT SAME LOCALITY BUT THE PROCURATOR WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING HE WOULD BE TAKEN TO HIS ROOM
A PRIVATE ROOM HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE KING AND ANOTHER FOR MONSIEUR
A NOTE WHICH YOU WILL FIND AT HOME WILL TELL YOU BEGONE BEGONE AT THESE WORDS SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE CORRIDOR AND PUSHED D'ARTAGNAN OUT OF THE ROOM D'ARTAGNAN OBEYED LIKE A CHILD WITHOUT THE LEAST RESISTANCE OR OBJECTION
AT SIX IN THE EVENING THE GUESTS BEGAN TO COME AS FAST AS THEY ENTERED THEY WERE PLACED IN THE GRAND SALOON ON THE PLATFORMS PREPARED FOR THEM AT NINE O'CLOCK MADAME LA PREMIERE PRESIDENTE ARRIVED
UPON THE EDGE OF WHICH FOR STILL GREATER PRECAUTION HE PLACED HIS FEET THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE TOOK PORTHOS INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM AND THEY BEGAN TO LAY THE BASIS OF A RECONCILIATION YOU CAN COME AND DINE THREE TIMES A WEEK
D'ARTAGNAN AT ONCE COMPREHENDED THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE HE CAST HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES SEIZED THE HAND AND TOUCHED IT RESPECTFULLY WITH HIS LIPS
PORTHOS DID NOT FEEL THE RIDICULE OF THIS AND TOOK IT FOR A PIECE OF SIMPLICITY AT WHICH HE LAUGHED IN HIS LARGE MUSTACHE
THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE WAITED TREMBLINGLY TO HOW MUCH SAID SHE I HOPE IT DOES NOT EXCEED SHE STOPPED
LITTERED WITH PAPERS ON QUITTING THE STUDY THEY LEFT THE KITCHEN ON THE RIGHT AND ENTERED THE RECEPTION ROOM ALL THESE ROOMS WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH ONE ANOTHER DID NOT INSPIRE PORTHOS FAVORABLY WORDS MIGHT BE HEARD AT A DISTANCE THROUGH ALL THESE OPEN DOORS
I CAN SEND FOR THEM TO THE LOUVRE WHERE THEY ARE AND THUS YOUR MAJESTY'S WISHES WILL BE COMPLIED WITH DO SO MADAME DO SO AND THAT AT ONCE FOR WITHIN AN HOUR THE BALLET WILL COMMENCE THE QUEEN BENT IN TOKEN OF SUBMISSION
OUT OF RESPECT WITHDREW SEVERAL STEPS SO THAT NOBODY HAD HEARD ANYTHING THE VIOLINS BEGAN TO SOUND WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT BUT NOBODY LISTENED TO THEM THE KING CAME OUT FIRST FROM HIS ROOM HE WAS IN A MOST ELEGANT HUNTING COSTUME
I WISHED TO KNOW THE DETAIL SAID SHE BECAUSE HAVING MANY RELATIVES IN BUSINESS I WAS ALMOST SURE OF OBTAINING THINGS AT A HUNDRED PER CENT LESS THAN YOU WOULD PAY YOURSELF AH AH SAID PORTHOS
THAT AT FIRST SIGHT ONE MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED TO HAVE SOME MEAT ON THEM PRETENDED TO SHOW THEMSELVES BUT THE CLERKS WERE NOT THE DUPES OF THIS DECEIT AND THEIR LUGUBRIOUS LOOKS SETTLED DOWN INTO RESIGNED COUNTENANCES
PORTHOS BIT HIS LIPS BECAUSE HE SAW NOT THE WHEREWITHAL TO DINE HE LOOKED TO SEE IF THE DISH OF BEANS WAS STILL THERE THE DISH OF BEANS HAD DISAPPEARED
WAS DRAWN AND THE PALE FACE OF THE CARDINAL APPEARED HE BEING DRESSED AS A SPANISH CAVALIER HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THOSE OF THE QUEEN AND A SMILE OF TERRIBLE JOY PASSED OVER HIS LIPS THE QUEEN DID NOT WEAR HER DIAMOND STUDS
AND HIS HIGHNESS MONSIEUR WITH THE QUEEN THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND THE BALLET BEGAN THE KING DANCED FACING THE QUEEN AND EVERY TIME HE PASSED BY HER HE DEVOURED WITH HIS EYES THOSE STUDS OF WHICH HE COULD NOT ASCERTAIN THE NUMBER
YOU ARE CERTAINLY TREATING YOUR COUSIN VERY HANDSOMELY THE POOR FOWL WAS THIN AND COVERED WITH ONE OF THOSE THICK BRISTLY SKINS THROUGH WHICH THE TEETH CANNOT PENETRATE WITH ALL THEIR EFFORTS THE FOWL MUST HAVE BEEN SOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME ON THE PERCH
YOU AT LAST CRIED D'ARTAGNAN SILENCE SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN PLACING HER HAND UPON HIS LIPS SILENCE AND GO THE SAME WAY YOU CAME BUT WHERE AND WHEN SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN CRIED D'ARTAGNAN
THE HASTE WHICH THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS IN TO CONVEY TO THE QUEEN THE EXCELLENT NEWS OF THE HAPPY RETURN OF HER MESSENGER PREVENTED THE TWO LOVERS FROM EXCHANGING MORE THAN A FEW WORDS
A SURTOUT OF GRAY PEARL VELVET FASTENED WITH DIAMOND CLASPS AND A PETTICOAT OF BLUE SATIN EMBROIDERED WITH SILVER ON HER LEFT SHOULDER SPARKLED THE DIAMOND STUDS ON A BOW OF THE SAME COLOR AS THE PLUMES AND THE PETTICOAT
IN WHICH THE WHOLE OF HIS SLENDER BODY WAS CONCEALED WAS BRISK AND DRY HIS LITTLE GRAY EYES SHONE LIKE CARBUNCLES AND APPEARED WITH HIS GRINNING MOUTH TO BE THE ONLY PART OF HIS FACE IN WHICH LIFE SURVIVED
THEY AROSE SLOWLY FROM THE TABLE FOLDED THEIR NAPKINS MORE SLOWLY STILL BOWED AND RETIRED GO YOUNG MEN GO AND PROMOTE DIGESTION BY WORKING SAID THE PROCURATOR GRAVELY
NOW SAID HE THE SACRIFICE IS CONSUMMATED AH IF I HAD NOT THE HOPE OF PEEPING WITH MADAME COQUENARD INTO HER HUSBAND'S CHEST
TO SMOOTH THE YELLOW WRINKLED BROW OF THE OLD PROCURATOR
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT ALL WAS NOT YET OVER AFTER THE REWARD OF HIS DEVOTION THAT OF HIS LOVE WAS TO COME BESIDES ALTHOUGH THE BALLET WAS DANCED THE EVENING HAD SCARCELY BEGUN SUPPER WAS TO BE SERVED AT THREE
AND THE WORD MAJESTY SEVERAL TIMES REPEATED INDICATED CLEARLY THAT HE WAS IN A CLOSET ATTACHED TO THE QUEEN'S APARTMENT THE YOUNG MAN WAITED IN COMPARATIVE DARKNESS AND LISTENED THE QUEEN APPEARED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY
THE YOUNG MEN FILLED UP THEIR THIRD OF A GLASS WITH WATER THEN WHEN THEY HAD DRUNK HALF THE GLASS THEY FILLED IT UP AGAIN AND CONTINUED TO DO SO THIS BROUGHT THEM BY THE END OF THE REPAST TO SWALLOWING A DRINK
WHICH SEEMED TO ASTONISH THE PERSONS WHO SURROUNDED HER AND WHO WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HER ALMOST ALWAYS SAD AND FULL OF CARE THE QUEEN ATTRIBUTED THIS JOYOUS FEELING TO THE BEAUTY OF THE FETE
WE ARE COUSINS IT APPEARS MONSIEUR PORTHOS SAID THE PROCURATOR RISING YET SUPPORTING HIS WEIGHT UPON THE ARMS OF HIS CANE CHAIR THE OLD MAN WRAPPED IN A LARGE BLACK DOUBLET
TO THE SHAME OF THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE AND HIS OWN REGRET THAT HE DID NOT SEE THAT FIRE THAT ANIMATION THAT BUSTLE WHICH WHEN A GOOD REPAST IS ON FOOT PREVAILS GENERALLY IN THAT SANCTUARY OF GOOD LIVING
EACH HOLDING A FLAMBEAU IN HIS HAND WENT TO ATTEND UPON THE KING WHOM THEY MET ON THE STEPS WHERE THE PROVOST OF THE MERCHANTS MADE HIM THE SPEECH OF WELCOME A COMPLIMENT TO WHICH HIS MAJESTY REPLIED WITH AN APOLOGY FOR COMING SO LATE
TAKE MY ADVICE DON'T TOUCH THEM DEVIL TAKE ME IF I TASTE ONE OF THEM MURMURED PORTHOS TO HIMSELF AND THEN SAID ALOUD THANK YOU MY COUSIN I AM NO LONGER HUNGRY THERE WAS SILENCE PORTHOS COULD HARDLY KEEP HIS COUNTENANCE
OF THE TEN PARTS OF SPEECH HE TURNS OVER THE PAGE AND READS LET THE PUPIL MAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS HE RUNS HIS EYE DOWN
THAT IS FROM THE OLD MAMSELLE'S SECRET BY MISSUS MARLITT AND THAT SENTENCE IS CONSTRUCTED UPON THE MOST APPROVED GERMAN MODEL YOU OBSERVE
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF AN ATTRACTIVE TRIFLER NAMED GAVESTON DAWDLED AWAY HIS DAYS AND FRITTERED AWAY HIS NIGHTS FINALLY THE NOBLES WHO DISLIKED GAVESTON CAPTURED HIM AND PUT HIM IN WARWICK CASTLE
SHE HAS A BROTHER I THINK YOU KNOW HIM
EDWARD FOUND HIMSELF NOW ON THE VERGE OF OPEN WAR WITH IRELAND AND WALES
AND DENTISTRY ARE IN BAD TASTE THE GERMANS
ARE MASSED TOGETHER BETWEEN A COUPLE OF KING PARENTHESES ONE OF WHICH IS PLACED IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE MAJESTIC SENTENCE AND THE OTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST LINE OF IT
HE MUST DO SOMETHING TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY OR HE WILL BECOME DISLIKED AUTHOR
NOR COULD NOR CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO CORRECT IN THE MIDST OF A CONVERSATION ON POLITICAL MATTERS ANNA PAVLOVNA BURST OUT OH DON'T SPEAK TO ME OF AUSTRIA PERHAPS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS
SLAFE WITH AN F AS A VILLAGE ELDER OF MINE WRITES IN HIS REPORTS SHE IS RICH AND OF GOOD FAMILY AND THAT'S ALL I WANT AND WITH THE FAMILIARITY AND EASY GRACE PECULIAR TO HIM
HE FROWNED WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO HE SAID AT LAST YOU KNOW I DID ALL A FATHER COULD FOR THEIR EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE BOTH TURNED OUT FOOLS HIPPOLYTE IS AT LEAST A QUIET FOOL
IN A KIND OF A GENERAL WAY ON THE GROUND IT IS THEN DEFINITELY LOCATED IT IS DOING SOMETHING THAT IS RESTING WHICH IS ONE OF THE GERMAN GRAMMAR'S IDEAS
THE AWFUL GERMAN LANGUAGE
BY DISPROVING THAT LAW IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO RETAIN THE OLD CONCEPTION OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BODIES BUT WITHOUT DISPROVING IT IT WOULD SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE STUDYING THE PTOLEMAIC WORLDS
AND RESPECT MINGLED WITH SADNESS AND THIS OCCURRED EVERY TIME SHE MENTIONED HER ILLUSTRIOUS PATRONESS
WITHOUT HYPHENS IT TREATS OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS EACH ENCLOSED IN A PARENTHESIS OF ITS OWN WITH HERE AND THERE EXTRA PARENTHESES
A PROPOS SHE ADDED BECOMING CALM AGAIN I AM EXPECTING TWO VERY INTERESTING MEN TONIGHT LE VICOMTE DE MORTEMART
BRUCE SURPRISED THE CAVALRY WITH DEEP PITS AND BEFORE THE ENGLISH COULD RECOVER FROM THIS
UNINVITED DEFENDERS OF THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY TODAY USE THAT LAW AS A WEAPON AGAINST RELIGION THOUGH THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY IN HISTORY LIKE THE LAW OF COPERNICUS IN ASTRONOMY FAR FROM DESTROYING
HANG ALL THE LAW AND THE PROFITS THE FOLLOWING YEAR EDWARD MARCHED INTO SCOTLAND
I DON'T SPEAK OF ANATOLE YOUR YOUNGEST I DON'T LIKE HIM SHE ADDED IN A TONE ADMITTING OF NO REJOINDER AND RAISING HER EYEBROWS TWO SUCH CHARMING CHILDREN
VERY RARE POSSIBLY A UNIQUE AND WANTED TO ADD IT TO HIS MUSEUM IF HE HAD KNOWN WHAT IT HAD COST ME TO ACQUIRE MY ART
SHE SUDDENLY PAUSED SMILING AT HER OWN IMPETUOSITY
FURTHER DISAGREEMENTS RECORDED ILLUSTRATING THE AMIABILITY OF THE JEW AND THE PERVERSITY OF THE SCOT IN TWELVE SEVENTY EIGHT THE JEWS TO THE NUMBER OF TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WERE HANGED FOR HAVING IN THEIR POSSESSION CLIPPED COINS
THE KING CAME AROUND TO BERWICK FROM DUNBAR BY STEAMER
ENGLAND WITH HER COMMERCIAL SPIRIT WILL NOT AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER'S LOFTINESS OF SOUL SHE HAS REFUSED TO EVACUATE MALTA SHE WANTED TO FIND AND STILL SEEKS SOME SECRET MOTIVE IN OUR ACTIONS
AND PERCEPTION BEFITTING A MAN OF THE WORLD HE INDICATED BY A MOVEMENT OF THE HEAD THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING THIS INFORMATION DO YOU KNOW HE SAID AT LAST
JUST AS PROLONGED AND STUBBORN IS THE STRUGGLE NOW PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW CONCEPTION OF HISTORY AND THEOLOGY IN THE SAME WAY STANDS ON GUARD FOR THE OLD VIEW AND ACCUSES THE NEW VIEW OF SUBVERTING REVELATION
MAINLY OF COMPOUND WORDS CONSTRUCTED BY THE WRITER ON THE SPOT AND NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY DICTIONARY SIX OR SEVEN WORDS COMPACTED INTO ONE WITHOUT JOINT OR SEAM THAT IS
THE GRAMMATICAL HOROSCOPE OF THIS MATTER I ANSWER UP CONFIDENTLY AND STATE IN GERMAN THAT THE BIRD IS STAYING IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP
SAYS SIE TO ME I GENERALLY TRY TO KILL HIM
THINK OF THE EXASPERATION OF NEVER KNOWING WHICH OF THESE MEANINGS THE SPEAKER IS TRYING TO CONVEY THIS EXPLAINS WHY
AND ONE DAY I SURPRISED THE KEEPER OF IT WITH MY GERMAN I SPOKE ENTIRELY IN THAT LANGUAGE HE WAS GREATLY INTERESTED
AND WITH THE GENTLE PATRONIZING INTONATION NATURAL TO A MAN OF IMPORTANCE WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOCIETY AND AT COURT HE WENT UP TO ANNA PAVLOVNA KISSED HER HAND PRESENTING TO HER HIS BALD SCENTED AND SHINING HEAD
SO FAR AS THE STEAMER IS CONCERNED BUT THE STATEMENT CAN DO NO HARM
BY REFUTING THESE NEW LAWS THE FORMER VIEW OF HISTORY MIGHT HAVE BEEN RETAINED BUT WITHOUT REFUTING THEM IT WOULD SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE STUDYING HISTORIC EVENTS AS THE RESULTS OF MAN'S FREE WILL
UNTIL HE JOTS DOWN AN INVENTORY OF THE WOMAN'S DRESS THAT IS MANIFESTLY ABSURD IT REMINDS A PERSON OF THOSE DENTISTS WHO SECURE YOUR INSTANT AND BREATHLESS INTEREST IN A TOOTH
THIS RAIN IS NOT RESTING BUT IS DOING SOMETHING ACTIVELY IT IS FALLING TO INTERFERE WITH THE BIRD LIKELY AND THIS INDICATES MOVEMENT
I BEGIN TO CIPHER OUT THE GERMAN FOR THAT ANSWER I BEGIN AT THE WRONG END NECESSARILY FOR THAT IS THE GERMAN IDEA I SAY TO MYSELF
DON'T TEASE WELL AND WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED ABOUT NOVOSILTSEV'S DISPATCH YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT IT REPLIED THE PRINCE IN A COLD LISTLESS TONE WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED
BY HER SISTER WAS ALL SHE SAID IN A DRY AND MOURNFUL TONE AS SHE NAMED THE EMPRESS ANNA PAVLOVNA'S FACE SUDDENLY ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF PROFOUND AND SINCERE DEVOTION
BUT ANATOLE IS AN ACTIVE ONE THAT IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM HE SAID THIS SMILING IN A WAY MORE NATURAL AND ANIMATED THAN USUAL SO THAT THE WRINKLES ROUND HIS MOUTH
THAT TO LEARN TO READ AND UNDERSTAND A GERMAN NEWSPAPER IS A THING WHICH MUST ALWAYS REMAIN AN IMPOSSIBILITY TO A FOREIGNER YET EVEN THE GERMAN BOOKS ARE NOT ENTIRELY FREE
LITTLE LEARNING MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD KIN PROVERBS
THAT THE BIRD IS WAITING IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP ON ACCOUNT OF THE RAIN OF COURSE NO BIRD WOULD DO THAT BUT THEN YOU MUST STICK TO THE BOOK VERY WELL
FOR IF A CERTAIN MODE OF GOVERNMENT WAS ESTABLISHED OR CERTAIN MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES TOOK PLACE IN CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AND SUCH GEOGRAPHIC ETHNOGRAPHIC OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
IT NECESSARILY CAN'T BE CLEARNESS EVEN A JURY WOULD HAVE PENETRATION ENOUGH TO DISCOVER THAT A WRITER'S IDEAS MUST BE A GOOD DEAL CONFUSED A GOOD DEAL OUT OF LINE AND SEQUENCE
CONCEIVE OF ANYTHING MORE CONFUSING THAN THAT THESE THINGS ARE CALLED SEPARABLE VERBS THE GERMAN GRAMMAR IS BLISTERED ALL OVER WITH SEPARABLE VERBS AND THE WIDER
WHEN HE STARTS OUT TO SAY THAT A MAN MET A COUNSELOR'S WIFE IN THE STREET AND THEN RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THIS SO SIMPLE UNDERTAKING HALTS THESE APPROACHING PEOPLE AND MAKES THEM STAND STILL
AND COMPLACENTLY SEATED HIMSELF ON THE SOFA FIRST OF ALL DEAR FRIEND TELL ME HOW YOU ARE SET YOUR FRIEND'S MIND AT REST
HOW FAR THAT VERB IS FROM THE READER'S BASE OF OPERATIONS WELL IN A GERMAN NEWSPAPER THEY PUT THEIR VERB AWAY OVER ON THE NEXT PAGE AND I HAVE HEARD THAT SOMETIMES
IS DETERMINED BY CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THAT CERTAIN RELATIONS OF POPULATION TO SOIL PRODUCE MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES THE FOUNDATIONS ON WHICH HISTORY HAD BEEN BUILT WERE DESTROYED IN THEIR ESSENCE
WITH A SLIGHT PARENTHESIS IN IT I WILL MAKE A PERFECTLY LITERAL TRANSLATION AND THROW IN THE PARENTHESIS MARKS AND SOME HYPHENS FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF THE READER THOUGH IN THE ORIGINAL
WITH THE GERMANS IT IS DOUBTLESS THE MARK AND SIGN OF A PRACTICED PEN AND OF THE PRESENCE OF THAT SORT OF LUMINOUS INTELLECTUAL FOG WHICH STANDS FOR CLEARNESS AMONG THESE PEOPLE FOR SURELY IT IS NOT
IN HISTORY IT IS THE INDEPENDENCE OF PERSONALITY FREE WILL AS WITH ASTRONOMY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING THE MOTION OF THE EARTH LAY IN ABANDONING THE IMMEDIATE SENSATION OF THE EARTH'S FIXITY
AND WHY ARE CHILDREN BORN TO SUCH MEN AS YOU IF YOU WERE NOT A FATHER THERE WOULD BE NOTHING I COULD REPROACH YOU WITH SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA LOOKING UP PENSIVELY I AM YOUR FAITHFUL SLAVE
AND HER FACE ASSUMED ITS MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION HE WAS MENTIONED AT HER MAJESTY'S AND YOU WERE PITIED THE PRINCE ANSWERED NOTHING BUT SHE LOOKED AT HIM SIGNIFICANTLY AWAITING A REPLY
THE TEACHER LETS ME SOFTLY DOWN WITH THE REMARK THAT WHENEVER THE WORD
I SHALL BE VERY CHARMED TO SEE YOU TONIGHT BETWEEN SEVEN AND TEN ANNETTE SCHERER HEAVENS WHAT A VIRULENT ATTACK REPLIED THE PRINCE NOT IN THE LEAST DISCONCERTED BY THIS RECEPTION HE HAD JUST ENTERED
SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA YOU ARE STAYING THE WHOLE EVENING I HOPE
THE PRINCE BOWED TO SIGNIFY HIS RESPECT AND GRATITUDE I OFTEN THINK SHE CONTINUED AFTER A SHORT PAUSE DRAWING NEARER TO THE PRINCE AND SMILING AMIABLY AT HIM AS IF TO SHOW THAT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL TOPICS
I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO MEET THEM SAID THE PRINCE BUT TELL ME HE ADDED WITH STUDIED CARELESSNESS AS IF IT HAD ONLY JUST OCCURRED TO HIM THOUGH THE QUESTION HE WAS ABOUT TO ASK WAS THE CHIEF MOTIVE OF HIS VISIT
TO RENOUNCE A FREEDOM THAT DOES NOT EXIST
I KNOW A LITTLE PERSON WHO IS VERY UNHAPPY WITH HER FATHER SHE IS A RELATION OF YOURS PRINCESS MARY BOLKONSKAYA PRINCE VASILI DID NOT REPLY THOUGH WITH THE QUICKNESS OF MEMORY
WHERE HE DIED IN BOUNDLESS OBSCURITY IN TWELVE NINETY SEVEN BALIOL WAS SUCCEEDED BY THE BRAVE WILLIAM WALLACE WHO WON A GREAT BATTLE AT STIRLING BUT WAS AFTERWARDS DEFEATED ENTIRELY AT FALKIRK
HITHER AND THITHER IN THE MOST HELPLESS WAY AND WHEN AT LAST HE THINKS HE HAS CAPTURED A RULE WHICH OFFERS FIRM GROUND TO TAKE A REST ON AMID THE GENERAL RAGE AND TURMOIL
N B I WAS INFORMED LATER BY A HIGHER AUTHORITY THAT THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION WHICH PERMITS ONE TO SAY
THEY HAVE DECIDED THAT BUONAPARTE HAS BURNT HIS BOATS AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE READY TO BURN OURS PRINCE VASILI ALWAYS SPOKE LANGUIDLY LIKE AN ACTOR REPEATING A STALE PART
SIE MEANS YOU AND IT MEANS SHE AND IT MEANS HER AND IT MEANS IT AND IT MEANS THEY AND IT MEANS THEM
THEY GET IN A HURRY AND HAVE TO GO TO PRESS WITHOUT GETTING TO THE VERB AT ALL OF COURSE THEN THE READER IS LEFT IN A VERY EXHAUSTED AND IGNORANT STATE WE HAVE THE PARENTHESIS DISEASE
IN SATIN AND SILK COVERED NOW VERY UNCONSTRAINED AFTER THE NEWEST FASHIONED DRESSED
IT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTY AND ANNOYANCE FOR THREE OF OUR TEACHERS HAD DIED IN THE MEAN TIME A PERSON WHO HAS NOT STUDIED GERMAN CAN FORM NO IDEA
ON THE OTHER IS THE PASSION FOR DESTRUCTION TO THE MEN WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE RISING TRUTHS OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY IT SEEMED THAT IF THEY ADMITTED THAT TRUTH IT WOULD DESTROY FAITH IN GOD IN THE CREATION OF THE FIRMAMENT
SERVING AS THE MEASURE OF VISIBLE PHENOMENA IN ASTRONOMY
BUT THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS NOT EXTENDED TO ANYTHING BUT RAIN THERE ARE TEN PARTS OF SPEECH AND THEY ARE ALL TROUBLESOME AN AVERAGE SENTENCE IN A GERMAN NEWSPAPER
BUT EVEN AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE LAW OF COPERNICUS
BUT AS IN ASTRONOMY THE NEW VIEW SAID IT IS TRUE THAT WE DO NOT FEEL THE MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH
AND WHAT HAVE THEY PROMISED NOTHING AND WHAT LITTLE THEY HAVE PROMISED THEY WILL NOT PERFORM PRUSSIA HAS ALWAYS DECLARED THAT BUONAPARTE IS INVINCIBLE AND THAT ALL EUROPE IS POWERLESS BEFORE HIM
THIS WAS IN TWELVE NINETY FIVE AND ON THIS DECLARATION
AND OF THE MOTION OF THE PLANETS SO IN HISTORY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING THE SUBJECTION OF PERSONALITY TO THE LAWS OF SPACE TIME AND CAUSE
AND REALLY YOU APPRECIATE THEM LESS THAN ANYONE AND SO YOU DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE THEM AND SHE SMILED HER ECSTATIC SMILE I CAN'T HELP IT SAID THE PRINCE
INTRUDES ITSELF INTO MY SENTENCE CLOTHED WITH AN AWFUL AND UNSUSPECTED POWER AND CRUMBLES THE GROUND FROM UNDER ME FOR INSTANCE MY BOOK INQUIRES AFTER A CERTAIN BIRD
AND TO YOU ALONE I CAN CONFESS THAT MY CHILDREN ARE THE BANE OF MY LIFE
IT IS ALWAYS INQUIRING AFTER THINGS WHICH ARE OF NO SORT OF CONSEQUENCE TO ANYBODY WHERE IS THE BIRD NOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION ACCORDING TO THE BOOK IS
AND ANOTHER PERSON WHOSE NAME IS NOT GIVEN
HE IS THE WELL KNOWN PRINCE BOLKONSKI WHO HAD TO RETIRE FROM THE ARMY UNDER THE LATE EMPEROR AND WAS NICKNAMED THE KING OF PRUSSIA HE IS VERY CLEVER BUT ECCENTRIC AND A BORE THE POOR GIRL IS VERY UNHAPPY
WHO DRESSED IN SIMPLE WHITE MUSLIN WITH A SINGLE TUBEROSE IN THE AMPLE FOLDS OF HER RICH BROWN HAIR HAD TOTTERED FEEBLY DOWN THE STAIRS STILL PALE FROM THE TERROR AND EXCITEMENT OF THE PAST EVENING
OF WHAT A PERPLEXING LANGUAGE IT IS SURELY THERE IS NOT ANOTHER LANGUAGE THAT IS SO SLIPSHOD AND SYSTEMLESS AND SO SLIPPERY AND ELUSIVE TO THE GRASP ONE IS WASHED ABOUT IN IT
THOUGH THEY ARE USUALLY SO MILD AS TO COVER ONLY A FEW LINES AND THEREFORE WHEN YOU AT LAST GET DOWN TO THE VERB IT CARRIES SOME MEANING TO YOUR MIND
SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE LAWS OF STATISTICS GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL ECONOMY COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY AND GEOLOGY WHICH DIRECTLY CONTRADICT ITS ASSUMPTIONS THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE OLD VIEWS AND THE NEW
BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO REMEMBER A GOOD DEAL OF WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE NOW HERE IS A SENTENCE
AND YOU ARE NO LONGER MY FRIEND NO LONGER MY FAITHFUL SLAVE AS YOU CALL YOURSELF BUT HOW DO YOU DO
HE WOULD ALSO HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WOULD BREAK ANY COLLECTOR TO BUY IT HARRIS AND I HAD BEEN HARD AT WORK ON OUR GERMAN DURING SEVERAL WEEKS AT THAT TIME AND ALTHOUGH WE HAD MADE GOOD PROGRESS
AS IN THE QUESTION OF ASTRONOMY THEN SO IN THE QUESTION OF HISTORY NOW THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IS BASED ON THE RECOGNITION OR NONRECOGNITION OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTE
YOUNG BOLKONSKI'S WIFE THIS VERY EVENING AND PERHAPS THE THING CAN BE ARRANGED
TO SECURE IT FOR THE BARON ANNA PAVLOVNA ALMOST CLOSED HER EYES TO INDICATE THAT NEITHER SHE NOR ANYONE ELSE HAD A RIGHT TO CRITICIZE WHAT THE EMPRESS DESIRED OR WAS PLEASED WITH
WAS LONG AND STUBBORNLY FOUGHT OUT IN PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY THEOLOGY STOOD ON GUARD FOR THE OLD VIEWS AND ACCUSED THE NEW OF VIOLATING REVELATION BUT WHEN TRUTH CONQUERED THEOLOGY ESTABLISHED ITSELF JUST AS FIRMLY ON THE NEW FOUNDATION
HE RAISED THE MAID OF HONOR'S HAND TO HIS LIPS KISSED IT AND SWUNG IT TO AND FRO AS HE LAY BACK IN HIS ARMCHAIR LOOKING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION ATTENDEZ SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA REFLECTING
SHE WAS AS SHE SAID SUFFERING FROM
THAT IT IS NO MOONLIGHT FROLIC EDWARD FLED TO WALES
PHILIP THEN SUBPOENAED EDWARD AS DUKE OF GUIENNE TO SHOW CAUSE WHY HE SHOULD NOT PAY DAMAGES FOR THE LOSS OF THE NAVY WHICH COULD NOT BE REPLACED FOR LESS THAN TWENTY POUNDS AND FINALLY WHEEDLED EDWARD OUT OF THE DUCHY
BUT AUSTRIA NEVER HAS WISHED AND DOES NOT WISH FOR WAR SHE IS BETRAYING US RUSSIA ALONE MUST SAVE EUROPE OUR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN RECOGNIZES HIS HIGH VOCATION AND WILL BE TRUE TO IT THAT IS THE ONE THING I HAVE FAITH IN
IN THE FIRST CASE IT WAS NECESSARY TO RENOUNCE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN UNREAL IMMOBILITY IN SPACE AND TO RECOGNIZE A MOTION WE DID NOT FEEL IN THE PRESENT CASE IT IS SIMILARLY NECESSARY
IN OUR LITERATURE TOO AND ONE MAY SEE CASES OF IT EVERY DAY IN OUR BOOKS AND NEWSPAPERS BUT WITH US IT IS THE MARK AND SIGN OF AN UNPRACTICED WRITER OR A CLOUDY INTELLECT WHEREAS
ACCORDING TO WHICH GENDER IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE WHEN I LOOK IN THE INTEREST OF SCIENCE I WILL CIPHER IT OUT ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IT IS MASCULINE VERY WELL THEN THE RAIN
BUT THE SCOTCH CALLED TO THEIR AID ROBERT BRUCE THE GRANDSON OF BALIOL'S COMPETITOR AND HE WAS SOLEMNLY CROWNED AT THE ABBEY OF SCONE DURING A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN AGAINST THESE PEOPLE EDWARD FELL SICK
BUT LONGING TO LAY HER POOR ACHING HEAD YET ONCE AGAIN UPON THE BREAST OF HIM WHOM SHE LOVED MORE DEARLY THAN LIFE ITSELF PARTED HOWEVER IT IS NOT WELL
NOT NECESSARY BUT PRETTY GERMAN BOOKS ARE EASY ENOUGH TO READ WHEN YOU HOLD THEM BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS OR STAND ON YOUR HEAD SO AS TO REVERSE THE CONSTRUCTION BUT I THINK
THEY ORGANIZED A SCHEME TO THROW OFF THE SPENCERS AND DETHRONE EDWARD THE THINKLESS
AFTER HAVING BEEN MOST INHUMANLY TREATED IN BERKELEY CASTLE WHITHER HE HAD BEEN REMOVED THUS ENDS THE SAD HISTORY OF A MONARCH WHO MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED IN A MINOR POSITION ON A HEN FARM BUT WHO MADE A BEASTLY FLUKE IN THE KING BUSINESS
OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT AND THE MONUMENT IS FINISHED I SUPPOSE
LAVATER WOULD HAVE SAID I LACK THE BUMP OF PATERNITY DON'T JOKE I MEAN TO HAVE A SERIOUS TALK WITH YOU DO YOU KNOW I AM DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR YOUNGER SON BETWEEN OURSELVES
THE SUBDUED SMILE WHICH THOUGH IT DID NOT SUIT HER FADED FEATURES ALWAYS PLAYED ROUND HER LIPS EXPRESSED AS IN A SPOILED CHILD A CONTINUAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER CHARMING DEFECT WHICH SHE NEITHER WISHED
TO BE APPOINTED FIRST SECRETARY AT VIENNA THE BARON BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS A POOR CREATURE PRINCE VASILI WISHED TO OBTAIN THIS POST FOR HIS SON
WHAT ANSWER DID NOVOSILTSEV GET NONE THE ENGLISH HAVE NOT UNDERSTOOD AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE SELF ABNEGATION OF OUR EMPEROR WHO WANTS NOTHING FOR HIMSELF BUT ONLY DESIRES THE GOOD OF MANKIND
THERE ARE NO PARENTHESIS MARKS OR HYPHENS AND THE READER IS LEFT TO FLOUNDER THROUGH TO THE REMOTE VERB THE BEST WAY HE CAN BUT WHEN HE UPON THE STREET THE
WEARING AN EMBROIDERED COURT UNIFORM KNEE BREECHES AND SHOES AND HAD STARS ON HIS BREAST AND A SERENE EXPRESSION ON HIS FLAT FACE HE SPOKE IN THAT REFINED FRENCH IN WHICH OUR GRANDFATHERS NOT ONLY SPOKE BUT THOUGHT
FROM THE TIME THE FIRST PERSON SAID AND PROVED THAT THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS OR OF CRIMES
ALL THESE FESTIVITIES AND FIREWORKS ARE BECOMING WEARISOME IF THEY HAD KNOWN THAT YOU WISHED IT THE ENTERTAINMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT OFF SAID THE PRINCE WHO LIKE A WOUND UP CLOCK
DESPITE HER FORTY YEARS OVERFLOWED WITH ANIMATION AND IMPULSIVENESS TO BE AN ENTHUSIAST HAD BECOME HER SOCIAL VOCATION AND SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN SHE DID NOT FEEL LIKE IT SHE BECAME ENTHUSIASTIC
WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF SLIDING IT INTO THE ACCUSATIVE CASE
THAT IS HOW I EXPLAIN IT TO MYSELF IT CAN'T BE HELPED HE SAID NO MORE BUT EXPRESSED HIS RESIGNATION TO CRUEL FATE BY A GESTURE ANNA PAVLOVNA MEDITATED
OR PETRIFY IT PERSONAL PRONOUNS AND ADJECTIVES ARE A FRUITFUL NUISANCE IN THIS LANGUAGE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT FOR INSTANCE THE SAME SOUND
AND DELIVERED BY A SCARLET LIVERIED FOOTMAN THAT MORNING RAN AS FOLLOWS IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO COUNT OR PRINCE AND IF THE PROSPECT OF SPENDING AN EVENING WITH A POOR INVALID IS NOT TOO TERRIBLE
AND REMAIN IN JAIL THERE INSTEAD OF CAUSING A SCANDAL BY STAYING AWAY AND SPENDING HIS MONEY IN WALES HE WAS CONFINED IN KENILWORTH CASTLE WHILE HIS SON WAS OSTENSIBLY KING THOUGH HIS WIFE AND MORTIMER REALLY MANAGED THE KINGDOM
TENAYA INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF TAKING ALL THE INDIANS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN PLAIN MY PEOPLE
VANKA DID THE SAME THEN BEFORE CUTTING DOWN THE CHRISTMAS TREE HIS GRANDFATHER SMOKED HIS PIPE TOOK A LONG PINCH OF SNUFF AND MADE FUN OF POOR FROZEN LITTLE VANKA
WHICH SOME HAVE CLAIMED FOR HIM
THEY MAKE ME SLEEP IN THE VESTIBULE AND WHEN THEIR BRAT CRIES I DON'T SLEEP AT ALL BUT HAVE TO ROCK THE CRADLE DEAR GRANDPAPA FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TAKE ME AWAY FROM HERE
THEN SPREADING A CRUMPLED SHEET OF PAPER IN FRONT OF HIM HE BEGAN TO WRITE BEFORE HOWEVER DECIDING TO MAKE THE FIRST LETTER HE LOOKED FURTIVELY AT THE DOOR AND AT THE WINDOW GLANCED SEVERAL TIMES AT THE SOMBRE IKON
LIKE EVERY ARTIST WORTH CONSIDERATION HE HAD NO RECIPE IF HIS EXOTIC CHOICE OF SUBJECT WAS OFTEN HIS STRENGTH IT WAS OFTEN HIS WEAKNESS
THAT SAME DAY THE OLD CHIEF WAS CAPTURED ON THE CLIFF ON THE EAST SIDE OF INDIAN CANYON BY SOME OF BOLING'S SCOUTS AS TENAYA WALKED TOWARD THE CAMP HIS EYE FELL UPON THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FAVORITE SON CAPTAIN BOLING
A SECOND EXPEDITION WAS MADE IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR BOLING WHEN THE VALLEY WAS ENTERED NO INDIANS WERE SEEN BUT THE MANY WIGWAMS WITH SMOLDERING FIRES
MY MASTER DRAGGED ME BY MY HAIR INTO THE YARD AND BELABOURED ME WITH A SHOE MAKER'S STIRRUP BECAUSE
I UNFORTUNATELY FELL ASLEEP AND DURING THE WEEK MY MISTRESS TOLD ME TO CLEAN A HERRING
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE TO LET ME CLEAN THE BOOTS OR I'LL GO INSTEAD OF FEDYA AS UNDERHERDSMAN DEAR GRANDPAPA I CAN'T BEAR THIS ANY MORE IT'LL KILL ME I WANTED TO RUN AWAY TO OUR VILLAGE
THOUGH IT BE AT HAND YEA AND BEFORE THERE SHALL APPEAR A RACE OF MEN WHO LOTH TO SIT STILL IN ONE PLACE SHALL BOLDLY GO BEFORE ALL PEOPLE'S EYES SUBORNING MEN OF DIVERS QUALITIES TO DRAW THEM
THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS ERECTED IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AND WAS KEPT AS A HOTEL THE NEXT YEAR BY G A HITE AND LATER BY J H NEAL AND S M CUNNINGHAM
HIS CUDGEL WILL BE HANGING FROM HIS BELT HE WILL BE HUGGING HIMSELF WITH COLD GIVING A LITTLE DRY OLD MAN'S COUGH AND AT TIMES PINCHING A SERVANT GIRL OR A COOK WON'T WE TAKE SOME SNUFF
TAKE A GOLDEN WALNUT AND HIDE IT IN MY GREEN BOX ASK THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA FOR IT SAY IT'S FOR VANKA VANKA SIGHED CONVULSIVELY AND AGAIN STARED AT THE WINDOW
AFTER WAITING STILL ANOTHER DAY THE EXPEDITION STARTED FOR THE VALLEY WHEN TENAYA WAS QUESTIONED AS TO THE ROUTE AND DISTANCE HE SAID THAT THE SNOW WAS SO DEEP THAT THE HORSES COULD NOT GO THROUGH IT
BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND WHEN I AM DEAD I WILL CALL MY PEOPLE TO COME AND THEY SHALL HEAR ME IN THEIR SLEEP AND COME TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR CHIEF AND HIS SON YES SIR AMERICA MY SPIRIT WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
BUT WAS CAUGHT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SWIM ACROSS THE RIVER
ALWAYS SMILING AND BLEAR EYED ALL DAY HE SLEPT IN THE SERVANTS KITCHEN OR TRIFLED WITH THE COOKS
MY YOUNG MEN HAVE SOMETIMES TAKEN HORSES AND MULES FROM THE WHITES
THEY STOLE A NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES FROM THEIR ENTERTAINERS AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
WHO HAD BEEN APPRENTICE TO THE SHOEMAKER ALIAKHIN FOR THREE MONTHS DID NOT GO TO BED THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS
THE YOUNG FIR TREES WRAPT IN HOAR FROST STOOD MOTIONLESS WAITING FOR WHICH OF THEM WOULD DIE SUDDENLY A HARE SPRINGING FROM SOMEWHERE WOULD DART OVER THE SNOWDRIFT HIS GRANDFATHER COULD NOT HELP SHOUTING CATCH IT CATCH IT
INFORMED HIM OF THE WISHES OF THE COMMISSIONERS BUT THE OLD CHIEF WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS OF SAVAGE AND FEARED THAT HE WAS TAKING THIS METHOD OF GETTING THE TRIBE INTO HIS POWER FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVENGING HIS PERSONAL WRONG
TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY
MY YOUNG MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GOLD DIGGERS WERE OUR ENEMIES
FOOD THERE IS NONE IN THE MORNING IT'S BREAD AT DINNER GRUEL AND IN THE EVENING BREAD AGAIN AS FOR TEA OR SOUR CABBAGE SOUP THE MASTER AND THE MISTRESS THEMSELVES GUZZLE THAT
BUT I HAVE NO BOOTS AND I WAS AFRAID OF THE FROST AND WHEN I GROW UP I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU
BY KEEPING IT IN GAOL WHENCE IT SHALL HAVE NO HELP BUT HIM WHO BEING TO IT GAVE AND TO INCREASE HIS MOURNFUL ACCIDENT
TO THE BORDER OF THE PARK EIGHT MILES BELOW THE VALLEY IT IS EIGHTY MILES LONG
THAT NEVER WERE IN HISTORY SUCH COILS SET DOWN AS YET SUCH TUMULTS AND GARBOILS
THROUGH AN INTERPRETER EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY LATER
TO THE MAJOR SAVAGE FIRMLY SAID YOUR PEOPLE MUST GO TO THE COMMISSIONERS IF THEY DO NOT YOUR YOUNG MEN WILL AGAIN STEAL HORSES AND KILL AND PLUNDER THE WHITES
MORE THAN ONCE THEY HAD NEARLY BROKEN HIS HIND LEGS TWICE HE HAD BEEN HUNG UP EVERY WEEK HE WAS NEARLY FLOGGED TO DEATH BUT HE ALWAYS RECOVERED AT THIS MOMENT FOR CERTAIN
WHEN MISTER J M HUTCHINGS HAVING HEARD OF ITS WONDERFUL SCENERY COLLECTED A PARTY AND MADE THE FIRST REGULAR TOURIST'S VISIT TO THE YOSEMITE
ARE PERSECUTED BUT HAPPY IS THAT MAN THAT SHALL NOT BE SCANDALIZED BUT SHALL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO THE END IN AIMING AT THAT MARK WHICH GOD BY HIS DEAR SON HATH SET BEFORE US
AND WE SHALL BE GLAD TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THEM WE WILL STAY HERE AND BE FRIENDS MY PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE PLAINS SOME OF THE TRIBES WHO HAVE GONE THERE ARE VERY BAD WE CANNOT LIVE WITH THEM HERE WE CAN DEFEND OURSELVES
MOST OF IT HAD BEEN EXPLORED IN A GENERAL WAY AND SOME OF ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURES HAD BEEN NAMED BUT THE INDIANS HAD FLED UP THE TENAYA CANYON TRAIL AND NONE OF THEM WERE SEEN EXCEPT AN OLD WOMAN UNABLE TO FOLLOW THE FUGITIVES
BUT EARLY ONE MORNING AFTER A FEAST OF HORSE FLESH A BAND OF MONOS SURPRISED THEM IN THEIR HUTS KILLING TENAYA AND NEARLY ALL HIS TRIBE ONLY A SMALL REMNANT ESCAPED DOWN THE RIVER CANYON
AND I AM FRIGHTFULLY HUNGRY AND SO SAD THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU I CRY ALL THE TIME THE OTHER DAY THE MASTER HIT ME ON THE HEAD WITH A LAST I FELL TO THE GROUND AND ONLY JUST RETURNED TO LIFE
MAKE UPON IT AS MANY GRAVE ALLEGORIES AND GLOSSES AS YOU WILL AND DOTE UPON IT YOU AND THE REST OF THE WORLD AS LONG AS YOU PLEASE FOR MY PART
AND SAID HIS PEOPLE WERE ON THE WAY TO OUR CAMP TO GO WITH THE MEN SENT BY THE GREAT FATHER WHO WAS SO GOOD AND RICH ANOTHER DAY PASSED BUT NO INDIANS FROM THE DEEP VALLEY APPEARED
HOW TO SNEAK UP AND TAKE A BITE AT A LEG OR SLIP INTO THE LARDER
IS THE WORD PRIVILEGE THE DESIGN WHEN FINALLY DEVELOPED WAS A SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT TO MONSIEUR DEPLIS WHO HAD SUSPECTED ICARUS OF BEING A FORTRESS
IS GUARDED JEALOUSLY FROM ALL BUT A FEW INTIMATES THE SECRET TO TAKE A CONTRARY CASE OF OUR INFALLIBLE REMEDY FOR SEASICKNESS IS THRUST UPON EVERY TRAVELLER WE MEET
LOCATE IS THE PLEASANT WORD HERE STILL MORE SATISFYING IN THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO WAS TATTOOED FROM COLLAR BONE TO WAIST LINE WITH A GLOWING REPRESENTATION OF THE FALL OF ICARUS
WHICH MADE ME THUS UNGENEROUS OF HIS NAME OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE FEELING THAT THE OTHERS WERE NOT WORTHY OF HIM BUT HOW REFRESHING IT WAS WHEN SOME INTELLECTUALLY BLOWN UP STRANGER SAID DO YOU EVER READ SAKI
BY MISTER HUTCHINGS ALL THESE HOTELS HAVE VANISHED EXCEPT THE FRAME HOUSE BUILT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION A LARGE HOTEL BUILT ON THE BRINK OF THE RIVER IN FRONT OF THE OLD ONE
SAID GARGANTUA THE PROGRESS AND CARRYING ON OF THE DIVINE TRUTH BY SAINT GODERAN SAID THE MONK THAT IS NOT MY EXPOSITION IT IS THE STYLE OF THE PROPHET MERLIN
THIS LED TO ANOTHER YOSEMITE EXPEDITION A DETACHMENT OF REGULAR SOLDIERS FROM FORT MILLER UNDER LIEUTENANT MOORE U S A WAS AT ONCE DISPATCHED TO CAPTURE OR PUNISH THE MURDERERS
MY LIFE IS A MISFORTUNE WORSE THAN ANY DOG'S I SEND GREETINGS TO ALIONA TO ONE EYED TEGOR AND THE COACHMAN AND DON'T LET ANY ONE HAVE MY MOUTH ORGAN I REMAIN YOUR GRANDSON
IF SAKI'S CARELESS CRUELTY THAT STRANGE BOYISH INSENSITIVENESS OF HIS DID NOT GIVE HIM AN UNFAIR START IN THE PURSUIT OF LAUGHTER IT MAY HAVE BEEN SO BUT FORTUNATELY
TO SEE YOUR PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT COME THEY WILL COME IF I FIND THEM YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY OF MY PEOPLE THERE SAID TENAYA I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE MY TRIBE IS SMALL
THE CHILDREN DON'T COME ROUND AT CHRISTMAS WITH A STAR NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO SING IN THE CHOIR
AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT BY ACT OF CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY OF THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN O FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE
AND GUIDED BY ONE OF TENAYA'S INDIANS DESCENDED BY THE SAME ROUTE AS THAT FOLLOWED BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL AND THE WEARY PARTY WENT INTO CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK OPPOSITE EL CAPITAN AFTER SUPPER SEATED AROUND A BIG FIRE
AND WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN BOLING HE SAID IN GREAT EMOTION KILL ME SIR CAPTAIN YES KILL ME AS YOU KILLED MY SON AS YOU WOULD KILL MY PEOPLE IF THEY WERE TO COME TO YOU
IF HIS INSENSITIVENESS CARRIED HIM THROUGH AT TIMES TO VICTORY IT BROUGHT HIM AT TIMES TO DEFEAT I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS THAT MASTERY OF THE CONTE IN THIS BOOK AT LEAST
IF IT BE LAWFUL FIRMLY TO BELIEVE
BUT HE WAS MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE WORK WHICH WAS ACCLAIMED BY ALL WHO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING IT AS PINCINI'S MASTERPIECE THIS STORY THE BACKGROUND
WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS WARLIKE TRIBE AND CONDUCT THEM TO THE FRESNO RESERVATION THAT THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN HOME THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED
BUSIED HERSELF MOST ABOUT IT WHEN LITTLE VANKA'S MOTHER PELAGUEYA WAS STILL ALIVE AND WAS SERVANT WOMAN IN THE HOUSE OLGA IGNATYEVNA USED TO STUFF HIM WITH SUGAR CANDY AND HAVING NOTHING TO DO
O HE IS WORTHY PRAISE THAT SHRINKETH NOT NO SOONER WAS THIS ENIGMATICAL MONUMENT READ OVER BUT GARGANTUA FETCHING A VERY DEEP SIGH SAID UNTO THOSE THAT STOOD BY
MYSELF BUT LATELY DOWN FROM SAINT JAMES I WAS NOT TOO PROUD TO TAKE SOME SLIGHT BUT PITYING INTEREST IN MEN OF OTHER COLLEGES THE UNUSUAL NAME OF A FRESHMAN UP AT WESTMINSTER ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION
SHOWED THAT THEY HAD BEEN HURRIEDLY ABANDONED THAT VERY DAY LATER FIVE YOUNG INDIANS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT TO WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EXPEDITION WERE CAPTURED AT THE FOOT OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER A LIVELY CHASE
INARIME DID NOT MORE QUICKLY MOVE WHEN TYPHEUS DID THE VAST HUGE HILLS REMOVE AND FOR DESPITE INTO THE SEA THEM THREW THUS SHALL IT THEN BE LOST BY WAYS NOT FEW
THE GLOBE TERRESTRIAL IS THE TENNIS BALL AFTER PLAYING WHEN THE GAME IS DONE THEY REFRESH THEMSELVES BEFORE A CLEAR FIRE AND CHANGE THEIR SHIRTS AND VERY WILLINGLY THEY MAKE ALL GOOD CHEER
DESCRIBED IT IN ARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY A GOOD ARTIST WHO WAS TAKEN INTO THE VALLEY BY HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
AND THE OTHER COMETH IN THEY BELIEVE THE FIRST THAT SAITH THE BALL WAS OVER OR UNDER THE LINE THE WATERS ARE THE HEATS THAT THE PLAYERS TAKE TILL THEY SWEAT AGAIN THE CORDS OF THE RACKETS ARE MADE OF THE GUTS OF SHEEP OR GOATS
AND CHILDREN THEIR OWN PARENTS IN A WORD ALL REVERENCE SHALL THEN BE BANISHED NO TRUE RESPECT TO OTHER SHALL BE HAD THEY'LL SAY THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS TURN BOTH IN HIS GOING FORTH AND HIS RETURN
AND NOW CONSIDER I DO YOU EXHORT IN SUCH COMMOTIONS SO CONTINUAL WHAT REST CAN TAKE THE GLOBE TERRESTRIAL MOST HAPPY THEN ARE THEY THAT CAN IT HOLD AND USE IT CAREFULLY AS PRECIOUS GOLD
POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
AND MISSUS PACKLETIDE'S TIGER SEEM TO ME TO BE THE MASTERPIECES OF THIS BOOK IN BOTH OF THEM CLOVIS EXERCISES NEEDLESSLY HIS TITULAR RIGHT OF ENTRY BUT HE CAN BE REMOVED WITHOUT DAMAGE
TO US MANY OTHERS WHO WERE TRYING TO DO IT TOO FOR WE WERE SO DOMESTIC HE SO TERRIFYINGLY COSMOPOLITAN WHILE WE WERE BEING FUNNY AS PLANNED WITH COLLAR STUDS AND HOT WATER BOTTLES
TOO MUCH DOES IT BECOME MONOLOGUE JUDICIOUSLY FED ONE CHARACTER GIVING AND THE OTHER TAKING BUT IN COMMENT IN REFERENCE IN DESCRIPTION IN EVERY DEVELOPMENT OF HIS STORY
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SPARE THE FLOCKS OF BEASTS THAT INNOCENTEST ARE BUT DID THEIR SINEWS AND THEIR BOWELS TAKE NOT TO THE GODS A SACRIFICE TO MAKE BUT USUALLY TO SERVE THEMSELVES FOR SPORT
IT IS USELESS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHO DESTROYED YOUR PROPERTY AND KILLED YOUR PEOPLE I AM OLD AND YOU CAN KILL ME IF YOU WILL BUT IT IS USELESS TO LIE TO YOU WHO KNOW MORE THAN ALL THE INDIANS
HOME TO OUR VILLAGE I CAN'T BEAR THIS ANY MORE I BOW TO THE GROUND TO YOU AND WILL PRAY TO GOD FOR EVER AND EVER TAKE ME FROM HERE OR I SHALL DIE
BUT I AM NOW WILLING TO GO FOR IT IS BEST FOR MY PEOPLE PUSHING AHEAD TAKING TURNS IN BREAKING A WAY THROUGH THE SNOW THEY ARRIVED IN SIGHT OF THE GREAT VALLEY EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
THEREFORE I WILL NOT LIE TO YOU BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME RETURN TO MY PEOPLE I WILL BRING THEM IN HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO THE NEXT DAY HE CAME BACK
IN DARK AND OBSCURE TERMS THE SUBORNERS OF MEN ARE THE MAKERS OF MATCHES WHICH ARE COMMONLY FRIENDS AFTER THE TWO CHASES ARE MADE HE THAT WAS IN THE UPPER END OF THE TENNIS COURT GOETH OUT
SO SHE TOOK THE HERRING AND STUCK ITS SNOUT INTO MY FACE THE ASSISTANTS TEASE ME SEND ME TO THE TAVERN FOR VODKA MAKE ME STEAL THE MASTER'S CUCUMBERS AND THE MASTER BEATS ME WITH WHATEVER IS HANDY
OUR EFFORTS TO BE FUNNY IN THE SAKI MANNER HAVE NOT SURVIVED TO PROVE IT WHAT IS SAKI'S MANNER
INSTRUCTING THEM TO TELL THE INDIANS THAT IF THEY WOULD COME IN AND MAKE TREATY WITH THE COMMISSIONERS THEY WOULD BE FURNISHED WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING AND BE PROTECTED BUT IF THEY DID NOT COME IN HE WOULD MAKE WAR UPON THEM AND KILL THEM ALL
HE WROTE I AM WRITING YOU A LETTER
HE ASKS HOLDING OUT HIS SNUFF BOX TO THE WOMEN THE WOMEN TAKE A PINCH OF SNUFF AND SNEEZE THE OLD MAN GOES INTO INDESCRIBABLE ECSTASIES BREAKS INTO LOUD LAUGHTER AND CRIES
LATER ONE HEARD THAT THIS UNDERGRADUATE FROM OVERSEAS HAD GONE UP AT AN AGE MORE ADVANCED THAN CUSTOMARY
ALMOST AS SOON AS HE WAS DISCOVERABLE LET US SPARE A MOMENT AND A TEAR FOR THOSE GOLDEN DAYS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WHEN THERE WERE FIVE LEISURELY PAPERS OF AN EVENING
SUCH WOES SUCH JARRINGS
ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY AFTER STARTING OUT
THAT IT LOOKS AS IF IT HAD BEEN POLISHED AND RUBBED OVER WITH SNOW FOR THE HOLIDAYS VANKA SIGHS DIPS HIS PEN IN THE INK AND CONTINUES TO WRITE LAST NIGHT I GOT A THRASHING
SAVAGE TOLD TENAYA THAT HE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH FOR INDIANS COULD NOT CROSS THE MOUNTAINS IN THE DEEP SNOW AND THAT HE KNEW THEY MUST STILL BE AT HIS VILLAGE OR HIDING SOMEWHERE NEAR IT
SHALL CEASE TO DART UPON IT ANY LIGHT MORE THAN IN AN ECLIPSE OR IN THE NIGHT SO THAT AT ONCE ITS FAVOUR SHALL BE GONE AND LIBERTY WITH IT BE LEFT ALONE AND YET BEFORE IT COME TO RUIN THUS
THE CORNERS OF VANKA'S MOUTH WENT DOWN HE RUBBED HIS EYES WITH HIS DIRTY FIST AND SOBBED I'LL GRATE YOUR TOBACCO FOR YOU HE CONTINUED I'LL PRAY TO GOD FOR YOU
WITHOUT BEING DISTRACTED OR DIVERTED BY HIS CARNAL AFFECTIONS AND DEPRAVED NATURE THE MONK THEN SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK IN YOUR CONSCIENCE IS MEANT AND SIGNIFIED BY THIS RIDDLE WHAT
WHICH WAS NOT IN THE BOYISH SAKI'S EQUIPMENT HE LEAVES LOOSE ENDS EVERYWHERE NOR IN HIS DIALOGUE DELIGHTFUL AS IT OFTEN IS FUNNY AS IT NEARLY ALWAYS IS IS HE THE SUPREME MASTER
THE LIEUTENANT BEING FULLY SATISFIED THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE REAL MURDERERS PROMPTLY PRONOUNCED JUDGMENT AND HAD THEM PLACED IN LINE AND SHOT LIEUTENANT MOORE PURSUED THE FUGITIVES TO MONO BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING ANY OF THEM
SO ONE FELT THAT THIS WESTMINSTER FREE LANCE IN THE THIRTIES WAS NO FIT COMPETITOR FOR THE YOUTH OF OTHER COLLEGES INDEED IT COULD NOT COMPETE WELL I DISCOVERED HIM
HE HAS A CHOICE OF WORDS A WAY OF PUTTING THINGS WHICH IS AS INEVITABLY HIS OWN VINTAGE AS ONCE TASTED IT BECOMES THE PRIVATE VINTAGE OF THE CONNOISSEUR
INSISTING THAT SHE SHALL SHARE OUR DELIGHT IN THEM AND THERE ARE BOOKS EQUALLY DEAR TO US OF WHICH WE SAY NOTHING FEARING LEST THE PRAISE OF OTHERS
AND YET BEFORE THAT THEY BE CLEAN DISPERST
HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS GRANDFATHER ALWAYS WENT TO THE FOREST FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND TOOK HIS GRANDSON WITH HIM WHAT HAPPY TIMES THE FROST CRACKLED HIS GRANDFATHER CRACKLED AND AS THEY BOTH DID
THE VERIEST LOUT OF ALL SHALL BE THEIR JUDGE O HORRIBLE AND DANGEROUS DELUGE DELUGE I CALL IT AND THAT FOR GOOD REASON FOR THIS SHALL BE OMITTED IN NO SEASON
LET US TAKE A SAMPLE OR TWO OF SAKI NINETEEN ELEVEN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE DINNER HAD WORN OFF THE WINE LISTS HAD BEEN CONSULTED
WHEN THE CAPTIVES WERE ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF THE TWO WHITE MEN THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD KILLED THEM TO PREVENT WHITE MEN FROM COMING TO THEIR VALLEY DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
NOT A BREATH OF WIND CLEAR AND FROSTY
SHORT TAILED DEVIL WHEN THE TREE WAS DOWN HIS GRANDFATHER DRAGGED IT TO THE MASTER'S HOUSE AND THERE THEY SET ABOUT DECORATING IT THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA VANKA'S GREAT FRIEND
IN WHICH THE FREE LANCE MIGHT GRADUATE AND HE COULD SPEAK OF HIS ALMA MATER WHETHER THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WITH AS MUCH PRIDE AS HE NEVER DOUBTED THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WOULD SPEAK ONE DAY OF HIM
AND TO THE SOUND OF BELLS VANKA RAN TO THE FIRST POST BOX AND SLIPPED HIS PRECIOUS LETTER INTO THE SLIT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LULLED BY HOPE HE WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY
CONSISTING OF SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN PERSONS THE NEXT YEAR THE REGULAR PLEASURE TRAVEL BEGAN AND A TRAIL ON THE MARIPOSA SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS OPENED BY MANN BROTHERS THIS TRAIL WAS AFTERWARDS PURCHASED BY THE CITIZENS OF THE COUNTY
BUT THAT YOUNG AND STRONG MEN CAN FIND PLENTY IN THE MOUNTAINS THEREFORE WHY SHOULD THEY GO TO THE HOT PLAINS TO BE PENNED UP LIKE HORSES AND CATTLE MY HEART HAS BEEN SORE SINCE THAT TALK
FROM WHOM HE HAD INQUIRED THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD TOLD HIM THAT LETTERS WERE TO BE PUT INTO POST BOXES AND FROM THERE THEY WERE CONVEYED OVER THE WHOLE EARTH IN MAIL TROIKAS BY DRUNKEN POST BOYS
AND VIVIDLY PICTURED TO HIMSELF HIS GRANDFATHER
HAD GONE OUT TO AN EARLY CHURCH SERVICE TO PROCURE FROM HIS EMPLOYER'S CUPBOARD
MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF MY TRIBE HAVE COME FROM OTHER TRIBES AND IF THEY GO TO THE PLAINS AND ARE SEEN THEY WILL BE KILLED BY THE FRIENDS OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY HAVE QUARRELED I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS GROWING OLD AND IT WAS WELL THAT I SHOULD GO
WHO TRUSTING TOO MUCH IN THEIR HOPEFUL TIME LIVE BUT A WHILE AND PERISH IN THEIR PRIME NEITHER SHALL ANY WHO THIS COURSE SHALL RUN LEAVE OFF THE RACE WHICH HE HATH ONCE BEGUN
IT WAS YOUR PEOPLE WHO ROBBED MY STORES BURNED MY HOUSES AND MURDERED MY MEN IT THEY DO NOT MAKE A TREATY YOUR WHOLE TRIBE WILL BE DESTROYED NOT ONE OF THEM WILL BE LEFT ALIVE TO THIS THE OLD CHIEF REPLIED
TAUGHT HIM TO READ WRITE COUNT UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND EVEN TO DANCE THE QUADRILLE WHEN PELAGUEYA DIED THEY PLACED THE ORPHAN VANKA IN THE KITCHEN WITH HIS GRANDFATHER AND FROM THE KITCHEN HE WAS SENT TO MOSCOW
AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG THEN FLOG ME LIKE THE GREY GOAT AND IF YOU REALLY THINK I SHAN'T FIND WORK
POOR MORTALS WHO WAIT FOR A HAPPY DAY CHEER UP YOUR HEARTS
ALL FOR SALE AND FOR EVERY KIND OF FISH AWFULLY CONVENIENT AND THERE WAS ONE HOOK WHICH WOULD CATCH A SHEAT FISH WEIGHING A POUND AND THERE ARE SHOPS WITH GUNS LIKE THE MASTER'S AND I AM SURE THEY MUST COST ONE HUNDRED RUBLES EACH
THE YOSEMITE OR GRIZZLY BEAR TRIBE FANCYING THEMSELVES SECURE IN THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD WERE THE MOST TROUBLESOME AND DEFIANT OF ALL AND IT WAS WHILE THE MARIPOSA BATTALION UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR SAVAGE
DID YOU KNOCK I KICKED REPLIED THE CHARITY BOY DID YOU WANT A COFFIN SIR INQUIRED OLIVER INNOCENTLY
HE HAS EXCITED DOMESTIC INSURRECTIONS AMONGST US AND HAS ENDEAVOURED TO BRING ON THE INHABITANTS OF OUR FRONTIERS THE MERCILESS INDIAN SAVAGES
SAYS SHE SHAN'T TAKE IT SIR GOOD STRONG WHOLESOME MEDICINE AS WAS GIVEN WITH GREAT SUCCESS TO TWO IRISH LABOURERS AND A COAL HEAVER
SO GROPING HIS WAY CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE DARK PASSAGE AND BIDDING OLIVER KEEP CLOSE TO HIM AND NOT BE AFRAID THE UNDERTAKER MOUNTED TO THE TOP OF THE FIRST FLIGHT OF STAIRS STUMBLING AGAINST A DOOR ON THE LANDING HE RAPPED AT IT WITH HIS KNUCKLES
AGAINST THE WALL WERE RANGED IN REGULAR ARRAY A LONG ROW OF ELM BOARDS CUT IN THE SAME SHAPE LOOKING IN THE DIM LIGHT LIKE HIGH SHOULDERED GHOSTS WITH THEIR HANDS IN THEIR BREECHES POCKETS
THEY SEEMED SO LIKE THE RATS HE HAD SEEN OUTSIDE
THAN TO RIGHT THEMSELVES BY ABOLISHING THE FORMS TO WHICH THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED BUT WHEN A LONG TRAIN OF ABUSES AND USURPATIONS PURSUING INVARIABLY THE SAME OBJECT EVINCES A DESIGN TO REDUCE THEM UNDER ABSOLUTE DESPOTISM
KEEP BACK DAMN YOU KEEP BACK IF YOU'VE A LIFE TO LOSE NONSENSE MY GOOD MAN SAID THE UNDERTAKER WHO WAS PRETTY WELL USED TO MISERY IN ALL ITS SHAPES NONSENSE
THE UNDERTAKER OFFERED NO REPLY TO THIS RAVING
AS THEIR NEGLECTED APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENTLY DENOTED WITHOUT THE CONCURRENT TESTIMONY AFFORDED BY THE SQUALID LOOKS OF THE FEW MEN AND WOMEN WHO WITH FOLDED ARMS AND BODIES HALF DOUBLED OCCASIONALLY SKULKED ALONG
AT THIS THE CHARITY BOY LOOKED MONSTROUS FIERCE AND SAID THAT OLIVER WOULD WANT ONE BEFORE LONG IF HE CUT JOKES WITH HIS SUPERIORS IN THAT WAY YER DON'T KNOW WHO I AM I SUPPOSE WORK'US SAID THE CHARITY BOY IN CONTINUATION
FOLLOWED THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN DOWN THE STAIRS TO BREAKFAST COME NEAR THE FIRE NOAH SAID CHARLOTTE I SAVED A NICE LITTLE BIT OF BACON FOR YOU FROM MASTER'S BREAKFAST OLIVER SHUT THAT DOOR AT MISTER NOAH'S BACK
THAT A COLD TREMBLE CAME OVER HIM EVERY TIME HIS EYES WANDERED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DISMAL OBJECT FROM WHICH HE ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE SOME FRIGHTFUL FORM SLOWLY REAR ITS HEAD TO DRIVE HIM MAD WITH TERROR
THE SOONER THIS JOB IS DONE THE BETTER NOAH LOOK AFTER THE SHOP OLIVER PUT ON YOUR CAP AND COME WITH ME OLIVER OBEYED AND FOLLOWED HIS MASTER ON HIS PROFESSIONAL MISSION
I WILL DIRECTLY SIR REPLIED OLIVER UNDOING THE CHAIN AND TURNING THE KEY I SUPPOSE YER THE NEW BOY AIN'T YER SAID THE VOICE THROUGH THE KEY HOLE YES SIR REPLIED OLIVER HOW OLD ARE YER INQUIRED THE VOICE
AND THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN HAVING READ AS MUCH OF THE BURIAL SERVICE AS COULD BE COMPRESSED INTO FOUR MINUTES GAVE HIS SURPLICE TO THE CLERK AND WALKED AWAY AGAIN NOW BILL SAID SOWERBERRY TO THE GRAVE DIGGER FILL UP IT WAS NO VERY
DIFFICULT TASK FOR THE GRAVE WAS SO FULL THAT THE UPPERMOST COFFIN WAS WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SURFACE
REPLIED OLIVER WITH CONSIDERABLE HESITATION NOT VERY MUCH SIR
AND IN A SMALL RECESS OPPOSITE THE DOOR THERE LAY UPON THE GROUND SOMETHING COVERED WITH AN OLD BLANKET OLIVER SHUDDERED AS HE CAST HIS EYES TOWARD THE PLACE AND CREPT INVOLUNTARILY CLOSER TO HIS MASTER
NOT AT ALL MY DEAR SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY HUMBLY I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR MY DEAR I WAS ONLY GOING TO SAY OH DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY INTERPOSED MISSUS SOWERBERRY I AM NOBODY DON'T CONSULT ME PRAY
UNLESS THOSE PEOPLE WOULD RELINQUISH THE RIGHT OF REPRESENTATION IN THE LEGISLATURE A RIGHT INESTIMABLE TO THEM AND FORMIDABLE TO TYRANTS ONLY HE HAS CALLED TOGETHER LEGISLATIVE BODIES AT PLACES UNUSUAL
FROM WHICH HE SELECTED A SMALL SCRAP OF PAPER WHICH HE HANDED OVER TO SOWERBERRY AHA SAID THE UNDERTAKER GLANCING OVER IT WITH A LIVELY COUNTENANCE
ONLY A LOAF OF BREAD AND A CUP OF WATER SHALL WE HAVE SOME BREAD DEAR SHE SAID EAGERLY CATCHING AT THE UNDERTAKER'S COAT AS HE ONCE MORE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR
OUR REPEATED PETITIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED ONLY BY REPEATED INJURY A PRINCE WHOSE CHARACTER IS THUS MARKED BY EVERY ACT WHICH MAY DEFINE A TYRANT IS UNFIT TO BE THE RULER OF A FREE PEOPLE
FOR THE PASSAGE OF A HUMAN BODY THE KENNEL WAS STAGNANT AND FILTHY THE VERY RATS WHICH HERE AND THERE LAY PUTREFYING IN ITS ROTTENNESS WERE HIDEOUS WITH FAMINE
AND HOW IMPARTIALLY THE SAME AMIABLE QUALITIES ARE DEVELOPED IN THE FINEST LORD AND THE DIRTIEST CHARITY BOY OLIVER HAD BEEN SOJOURNING AT THE UNDERTAKER'S SOME THREE WEEKS OR A MONTH MISTER AND MISSUS SOWERBERRY THE SHOP BEING SHUT UP
LORD LORD TO THINK OF IT IT'S AS GOOD AS A PLAY
COME THAT'S TOO MUCH OH IT'S SICKENING REPLIED THE BEADLE ANTIMONIAL MISTER SOWERBERRY SO IT IS ACQUIESCED THE UNDERTAKER WE ONLY HEARD OF THE FAMILY THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST SAID THE BEADLE
IS AN UNDISTINGUISHED DESTRUCTION OF ALL AGES SEXES AND CONDITIONS IN EVERY STAGE OF THESE OPPRESSIONS WE HAVE PETITIONED FOR REDRESS IN THE MOST HUMBLE TERMS
AND THE TWO MOURNERS WAITED PATIENTLY IN THE DAMP CLAY WITH A COLD RAIN DRIZZLING DOWN WHILE THE RAGGED BOYS WHOM THE SPECTACLE HAD ATTRACTED INTO THE CHURCHYARD PLAYED A NOISY GAME AT HIDE AND SEEK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES
BUMBLE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE REPLIED OBSTINATE PEOPLE MISTER SOWERBERRY VERY OBSTINATE PROUD TOO I'M AFRAID SIR
WHO HAVING CONSOLED HIM WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HE'D CATCH IT CONDESCENDED TO HELP HIM MISTER SOWERBERRY CAME DOWN SOON AFTER SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MISSUS SOWERBERRY APPEARED OLIVER HAVING CAUGHT IT IN FULFILMENT OF NOAH'S PREDICTION
THEY WALKED ON FOR SOME TIME THROUGH THE MOST CROWDED AND DENSELY INHABITED PART OF THE TOWN AND THEN STRIKING DOWN A NARROW STREET MORE DIRTY AND MISERABLE THAN ANY THEY HAD YET PASSED THROUGH PAUSED TO LOOK FOR THE HOUSE WHICH WAS THE OBJECT OF THEIR SEARCH
WHICH HE CUT INTO WEDGES THE SIZE OF HIS MOUTH WITH A CLASP KNIFE AND THEN CONSUMED WITH GREAT DEXTERITY I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID OLIVER AT LENGTH
AND THE AMOUNT AND PAYMENT OF THEIR SALARIES HE HAS ERECTED A MULTITUDE OF NEW OFFICES AND SENT HITHER SWARMS OF OFFICERS TO HARASS OUR PEOPLE AND EAT OUT THEIR SUBSTANCE
HAVING UNLOOSENED THE CRAVAT OF THE MAN WHO STILL REMAINED EXTENDED ON THE GROUND SHE TOTTERED TOWARDS THE UNDERTAKER SHE WAS MY DAUGHTER SAID THE OLD WOMAN
WHICH CONSTRAINS THEM TO ALTER THEIR FORMER SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT THE HISTORY OF THE PRESENT KING OF GREAT BRITAIN IS A HISTORY OF REPEATED INJURIES AND USURPATIONS ALL HAVING IN DIRECT OBJECT
FOR OPPOSING WITH MANLY FIRMNESS HIS INVASIONS ON THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE HE HAS REFUSED FOR A LONG TIME AFTER SUCH DISSOLUTIONS TO CAUSE OTHERS TO BE ELECTED
AND THE SOUND OF THE OLD DEEP BELL TO SOOTHE HIM IN HIS SLEEP OLIVER WAS AWAKENED IN THE MORNING BY A LOUD KICKING AT THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHOP DOOR WHICH BEFORE HE COULD HUDDLE ON HIS CLOTHES WAS REPEATED
WHICH MANY PEOPLE A GOOD DEAL OLDER THAN HE WILL BE AT NO LOSS TO UNDERSTAND AN UNFINISHED COFFIN ON BLACK TRESSELS WHICH STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP LOOKED SO GLOOMY AND DEATH LIKE
BY DECLARING US OUT OF HIS PROTECTION AND WAGING WAR AGAINST US HE HAS PLUNDERED OUR SEAS RAVAGED OUR COASTS BURNT OUR TOWNS AND DESTROYED THE LIVES OF OUR PEOPLE HE IS AT THIS TIME
HE HAS COMBINED WITH OTHERS TO SUBJECT US TO A JURISDICTION FOREIGN TO OUR CONSTITUTION AND UNACKNOWLEDGED BY OUR LAWS GIVING HIS ASSENT TO THEIR ACTS OF PRETENDED LEGISLATION
THE UNDERTAKER TURNED TO GO AWAY STOP STOP SAID THE OLD WOMAN IN A LOUD WHISPER WILL SHE BE BURIED TO MORROW OR NEXT DAY OR TO NIGHT
AT LENGTH AFTER A LAPSE OF SOMETHING MORE THAN AN HOUR MISTER BUMBLE AND SOWERBERRY AND THE CLERK WERE SEEN RUNNING TOWARDS THE GRAVE
HE STOPPED SHORT WELL SAID MISSUS SOWERBERRY SHARPLY NOTHING MY DEAR NOTHING SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY UGH YOU BRUTE SAID MISSUS SOWERBERRY
THERE WAS NO FIRE IN THE ROOM BUT A MAN WAS CROUCHING MECHANICALLY OVER THE EMPTY STOVE AN OLD WOMAN TOO HAD DRAWN A LOW STOOL TO THE COLD HEARTH AND WAS SITTING BESIDE HIM THERE WERE SOME RAGGED CHILDREN IN ANOTHER CORNER
SHOULDERED HIS SPADE AND WALKED OFF FOLLOWED BY THE BOYS WHO MURMURED VERY LOUD COMPLAINTS AT THE FUN BEING OVER SO SOON COME MY GOOD FELLOW SAID BUMBLE TAPPING THE MAN ON THE BACK THEY WANT TO SHUT UP THE YARD
CLENCHING HIS HANDS AND STAMPING FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR
REQUIRES THAT THEY SHOULD DECLARE THE CAUSES WHICH IMPEL THEM TO THE SEPARATION WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL
NOTHING WHEN YOU ARE USED TO IT MY BOY OLIVER WONDERED IN HIS OWN MIND WHETHER IT HAD TAKEN A VERY LONG TIME TO GET MISTER SOWERBERRY USED TO IT
WE ARE RATHER LATE AND IT WON'T DO TO KEEP THE CLERGYMAN WAITING MOVE ON MY MEN AS QUICK AS YOU LIKE
AND ALTERING FUNDAMENTALLY THE FORMS OF OUR GOVERNMENTS FOR SUSPENDING OUR OWN LEGISLATURES AND DECLARING THEMSELVES INVESTED WITH POWER TO LEGISLATE FOR US IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER HE HAS ABDICATED GOVERNMENT HERE
WE HAVE REMINDED THEM OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EMIGRATION AND SETTLEMENT HERE WE HAVE APPEALED TO THEIR NATIVE JUSTICE AND MAGNANIMITY AND WE HAVE CONJURED THEM BY THE TIES OF OUR COMMON KINDRED TO DISAVOW THESE USURPATIONS
THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS THAT TO SECURE THESE RIGHTS GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTED AMONG MEN
NOR HAVE WE BEEN WANTING IN ATTENTION TO OUR BRITTISH BRETHREN WE HAVE WARNED THEM FROM TIME TO TIME OF ATTEMPTS BY THEIR LEGISLATURE TO EXTEND AN UNWARRANTABLE JURISDICTION OVER US
FOR CUTTING OFF OUR TRADE WITH ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD FOR IMPOSING TAXES ON US WITHOUT OUR CONSENT FOR DEPRIVING US IN MANY CASES OF THE BENEFITS OF TRIAL BY JURY
THE OLD WOMAN'S FACE WAS WRINKLED HER TWO REMAINING TEETH PROTRUDED OVER HER UNDER LIP AND HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND PIERCING OLIVER WAS AFRAID TO LOOK AT EITHER HER OR THE MAN
KNEEL DOWN KNEEL DOWN KNEEL ROUND HER EVERY ONE OF YOU AND MARK MY WORDS I SAY SHE WAS STARVED TO DEATH I NEVER KNEW HOW BAD SHE WAS TILL THE FEVER CAME UPON HER
UNCOMFORTABLE AND DISTANT FROM THE DEPOSITORY OF THEIR PUBLIC RECORDS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FATIGUING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE WITH HIS MEASURES HE HAS DISSOLVED REPRESENTATIVE HOUSES REPEATEDLY
THE MAN WHO HAD NEVER ONCE MOVED SINCE HE HAD TAKEN HIS STATION BY THE GRAVE SIDE STARTED RAISED HIS HEAD STARED AT THE PERSON WHO HAD ADDRESSED HIM
HE HAS KEPT AMONG US IN TIMES OF PEACE STANDING ARMIES WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF OUR LEGISLATURES
AS MISSUS SOWERBERRY SAID THIS SHE GAVE AN HYSTERICAL LAUGH WHICH THREATENED VIOLENT CONSEQUENCES BUT MY DEAR SAID SOWERBERRY I WANT TO ASK YOUR ADVICE NO NO DON'T ASK MINE
OR VARIED THEIR AMUSEMENTS BY JUMPING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS OVER THE COFFIN MISTER SOWERBERRY AND BUMBLE BEING PERSONAL FRIENDS OF THE CLERK SAT BY THE FIRE WITH HIM AND READ THE PAPER
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ABSOLUTE TYRANNY OVER THESE STATES TO PROVE THIS LET FACTS BE SUBMITTED TO A CANDID WORLD HE HAS REFUSED HIS ASSENT TO LAWS THE MOST WHOLESOME AND NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD
IT WAS OPENED BY A YOUNG GIRL OF THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN THE UNDERTAKER AT ONCE SAW ENOUGH OF WHAT THE ROOM CONTAINED TO KNOW IT WAS THE APARTMENT TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED HE STEPPED IN OLIVER FOLLOWED HIM
I LAID HER OUT AND I MUST WALK
ALL HIS RELATIONS LET HIM HAVE HIS OWN WAY PRETTY WELL EH CHARLOTTE HE HE HE OH YOU QUEER SOUL SAID CHARLOTTE BURSTING INTO A HEARTY LAUGH IN WHICH SHE WAS JOINED BY NOAH AFTER WHICH THEY BOTH LOOKED SCORNFULLY AT POOR OLIVER TWIST
LAYING ITS FOUNDATION ON SUCH PRINCIPLES AND ORGANIZING ITS POWERS IN SUCH FORM AS TO THEM SHALL SEEM MOST LIKELY TO EFFECT THEIR SAFETY AND HAPPINESS PRUDENCE INDEED WILL DICTATE
DESCENDING FROM THE TOP OF THE POST MEANWHILE WITH EDIFYING GRAVITY NO SIR REJOINED OLIVER I'M MISTER NOAH CLAYPOLE SAID THE CHARITY BOY AND YOU'RE UNDER ME TAKE DOWN THE SHUTTERS YER IDLE YOUNG RUFFIAN
HE HAS CONSTRAINED OUR FELLOW CITIZENS TAKEN CAPTIVE ON THE HIGH SEAS TO BEAR ARMS AGAINST THEIR COUNTRY TO BECOME THE EXECUTIONERS OF THEIR FRIENDS AND BRETHREN OR TO FALL THEMSELVES BY THEIR HANDS
THAT GOVERNMENTS LONG ESTABLISHED SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED FOR LIGHT AND TRANSIENT CAUSES AND ACCORDINGLY ALL EXPERIENCE HATH SHOWN THAT MANKIND ARE MORE DISPOSED TO SUFFER WHILE EVILS ARE SUFFERABLE
SHE COULDN'T EVEN SEE HER CHILDREN'S FACES THOUGH WE HEARD HER GASPING OUT THEIR NAMES
AS HE SAT SHIVERING ON THE BOX IN THE COLDEST CORNER OF THE ROOM AND ATE THE STALE PIECES WHICH HAD BEEN SPECIALLY RESERVED FOR HIM
IN GENERAL CONGRESS ASSEMBLED APPEALING TO THE SUPREME JUDGE OF THE WORLD FOR THE RECTITUDE OF OUR INTENTIONS DO IN THE NAME AND BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THESE COLONIES SOLEMNLY PUBLISH AND DECLARE
HE HAS ENDEAVOURED TO PREVENT THE POPULATION OF THESE STATES
IMPRESSED WITH THE BELIEF THAT THE UNKNOWN WHO HAD ADDRESSED HIM THROUGH THE KEY HOLE HAD WALKED A FEW PACES OFF TO WARM HIMSELF FOR NOBODY DID HE SEE BUT A BIG CHARITY BOY SITTING ON A POST IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE EATING A SLICE OF BREAD AND BUTTER
THE SHOP BOYS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD LONG BEEN IN THE HABIT OF BRANDING NOAH IN THE PUBLIC STREETS WITH THE IGNOMINIOUS EPITHETS OF LEATHERS CHARITY AND THE LIKE AND NOAH HAD BOURNE THEM WITHOUT REPLY
RESUMED MISTER SOWERBERRY WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING HE WOULD MAKE A DELIGHTFUL MUTE MY LOVE MISSUS SOWERBERRY LOOKED UP WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONSIDERABLE WONDERMENT
THE REGRET OF NO RECENT SEPARATION WAS FRESH IN HIS MIND THE ABSENCE OF NO LOVED AND WELL REMEMBERED FACE SANK HEAVILY INTO HIS HEART BUT HIS HEART WAS HEAVY NOTWITHSTANDING
THE OCCASION WAS NOT LONG IN COMING HALF AN HOUR AFTER BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING MISTER BUMBLE ENTERED THE SHOP AND SUPPORTING HIS CANE AGAINST THE COUNTER DREW FORTH HIS LARGE LEATHERN POCKET BOOK
AND HE WISHED AS HE CREPT INTO HIS NARROW BED THAT THAT WERE HIS COFFIN AND THAT HE COULD BE LAIN IN A CALM AND LASTING SLEEP IN THE CHURCHYARD GROUND WITH THE TALL GRASS WAVING GENTLY ABOVE HIS HEAD
OLIVER HAD BEEN TOO OFTEN SUBJECTED TO THE PROCESS TO WHICH THE VERY EXPRESSIVE MONOSYLLABLE JUST RECORDED BEARS REFERENCE TO ENTERTAIN THE SMALLEST DOUBT THAT THE OWNER OF THE VOICE WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE
AND WITHOUT ALLOWING TIME FOR ANY OBSERVATION ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART PROCEEDED I DON'T MEAN A REGULAR MUTE TO ATTEND GROWN UP PEOPLE MY DEAR BUT ONLY FOR CHILDREN'S PRACTICE IT WOULD BE VERY NEW TO HAVE A MUTE IN PROPORTION MY DEAR
THE TERRIFIED CHILDREN CRIED BITTERLY BUT THE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD HITHERTO REMAINED AS QUIET AS IF SHE HAD BEEN WHOLLY DEAF TO ALL THAT PASSED MENACED THEM INTO SILENCE
AND THEN HER BONES WERE STARTING THROUGH THE SKIN THERE WAS NEITHER FIRE NOR CANDLE SHE DIED IN THE DARK IN THE DARK
TILL HIS ASSENT SHOULD BE OBTAINED AND WHEN SO SUSPENDED HE HAS UTTERLY NEGLECTED TO ATTEND TO THEM HE HAS REFUSED TO PASS OTHER LAWS FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF LARGE DISTRICTS OF PEOPLE
COFFIN PLATES ELM CHIPS BRIGHT HEADED NAILS AND SHREDS OF BLACK CLOTH LAY SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR AND THE WALL BEHIND THE COUNTER WAS ORNAMENTED WITH A LIVELY REPRESENTATION OF TWO MUTES
A GREAT MANY OF THE TENEMENTS HAD SHOP FRONTS BUT THESE WERE FAST CLOSED AND MOULDERING AWAY
TRANSPORTING LARGE ARMIES OF FOREIGN MERCENARIES TO COMPLEAT THE WORKS OF DEATH DESOLATION AND TYRANNY ALREADY BEGUN WITH CIRCUMSTANCES OF CRUELTY AND PERFIDY SCARCELY PARALLELED IN THE MOST BARBAROUS AGES
MISSUS SOWERBERRY WHO HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TASTE IN THE UNDERTAKING WAY WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE NOVELTY OF THIS IDEA
AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT THEM THEN ONLY A WOMAN WHO LODGES IN THE SAME HOUSE MADE AN APPLICATION TO THE POROCHIAL COMMITTEE FOR THEM TO SEND THE POROCHIAL SURGEON TO SEE A WOMAN AS WAS VERY BAD HE HAD GONE OUT TO DINNER
SAW HIM SAFELY OUT OF THE CHURCHYARD LOCKED THE GATE AND DEPARTED ON THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS WELL OLIVER SAID SOWERBERRY AS THEY WALKED HOME HOW DO YOU LIKE IT PRETTY WELL THANK YOU SIR
IN AN ANGRY AND IMPETUOUS MANNER ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TIMES WHEN HE BEGAN TO UNDO THE CHAIN THE LEGS DESISTED AND A VOICE BEGAN OPEN THE DOOR WILL YER
IN VERY STIFF NECKCLOTHS ON DUTY AT A LARGE PRIVATE DOOR WITH A HEARSE DRAWN BY FOUR BLACK STEEDS APPROACHING IN THE DISTANCE THE SHOP WAS CLOSE AND HOT
NEVER DID SIR EJACULATED THE BEADLE NO NOR NOBODY NEVER DID BUT NOW SHE'S DEAD WE'VE GOT TO BURY HER AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION AND THE SOONER IT'S DONE THE BETTER
THERE WAS NOT SO GREAT A NECESSITY FOR HURRYING AS MISTER SOWERBERRY HAD ANTICIPATED HOWEVER FOR WHEN THEY REACHED THE OBSCURE CORNER OF THE CHURCHYARD IN WHICH THE NETTLES GREW AND WHERE THE PARISH GRAVES WERE MADE
UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES SHE MERELY INQUIRED WITH MUCH SHARPNESS WHY SUCH AN OBVIOUS SUGGESTION HAD NOT PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER HUSBAND'S MIND BEFORE MISTER SOWERBERRY RIGHTLY CONSTRUED THIS AS AN ACQUIESCENCE IN HIS PROPOSITION
DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED THAT WHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THESE ENDS IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR TO ABOLISH IT AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED AS THE NIGHTLY HAUNTS OF SOME HOUSELESS WRETCHES FOR MANY OF THE ROUGH BOARDS WHICH SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF DOOR AND WINDOW WERE WRENCHED FROM THEIR POSITIONS TO AFFORD AN APERTURE WIDE ENOUGH
D'YE HEAR WORK'US SAID NOAH CLAYPOLE
WITH THIS MISTER CLAYPOLE ADMINISTERED A KICK TO OLIVER AND ENTERED THE SHOP WITH A DIGNIFIED AIR WHICH DID HIM GREAT CREDIT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A LARGE HEADED SMALL EYED YOUTH OF LUMBERING MAKE AND HEAVY COUNTENANCE
THAT THESE UNITED COLONIES ARE AND OF RIGHT OUGHT TO BE FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES THAT THEY ARE ABSOLVED FROM ALL ALLEGIANCE TO THE BRITISH CROWN
TO LOOK DIGNIFIED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT IS MORE ESPECIALLY SO WHEN SUPERADDED TO THESE PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS ARE A RED NOSE AND YELLOW SMALLS
THE CRAZY OLD WOMAN WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN BEWAILING THE LOSS OF HER CLOAK WHICH THE UNDERTAKER HAD TAKEN OFF TO PAY HIM ANY ATTENTION SO THEY THREW A CAN OF COLD WATER OVER HIM AND WHEN HE CAME TO
IT WAS SPEEDILY DETERMINED THEREFORE THAT OLIVER SHOULD BE AT ONCE INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF THE TRADE AND WITH THIS VIEW THAT HE SHOULD ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER ON THE VERY NEXT OCCASION OF HIS SERVICES BEING REQUIRED
AND THAT ALL POLITICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM AND THE STATE OF GREAT BRITAIN IS AND OUGHT TO BE TOTALLY DISSOLVED
IT AT ONCE REDUCED MISTER SOWERBERRY TO BEGGING AS A SPECIAL FAVOUR TO BE ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT MISSUS SOWERBERRY WAS MOST CURIOUS TO HEAR AFTER A SHORT DURATION THE PERMISSION WAS MOST GRACIOUSLY CONCEDED
FOR A COFFIN FIRST AND A POROCHIAL FUNERAL AFTERWARDS REPLIED MISTER BUMBLE FASTENING THE STRAP OF THE LEATHERN POCKET BOOK
HE WAS ALONE IN A STRANGE PLACE AND WE ALL KNOW HOW CHILLED AND DESOLATE THE BEST OF US WILL SOMETIMES FEEL IN SUCH A SITUATION THE BOY HAD NO FRIENDS TO CARE FOR OR TO CARE FOR HIM
FOR QUARTERING LARGE BODIES OF ARMED TROOPS AMONG US FOR PROTECTING THEM BY A MOCK TRIAL FROM PUNISHMENT FOR ANY MURDERS WHICH THEY SHOULD COMMIT ON THE INHABITANTS OF THESE STATES
WERE TAKING THEIR SUPPER IN THE LITTLE BACK PARLOUR WHEN MISTER SOWERBERRY AFTER SEVERAL DEFERENTIAL GLANCES AT HIS WIFE SAID MY DEAR HE WAS GOING TO SAY MORE BUT MISSUS SOWERBERRY LOOKING UP WITH A PECULIARLY UNPROPITIOUS ASPECT
OLIVER HAVING TAKEN DOWN THE SHUTTERS AND BROKEN A PANE OF GLASS IN HIS EFFORT TO STAGGER AWAY BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF THE FIRST ONE TO A SMALL COURT AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE KEPT DURING THE DAY WAS GRACIOUSLY ASSISTED BY NOAH
AND THE TWO MOURNERS KEPT AS NEAR THEM AS THEY COULD MISTER BUMBLE AND SOWERBERRY WALKED AT A GOOD SMART PACE IN FRONT AND OLIVER WHOSE LEGS WERE NOT SO LONG AS HIS MASTER'S RAN BY THE SIDE
AND THE BARE COFFIN HAVING BEEN SCREWED DOWN WAS HOISTED ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE BEARERS AND CARRIED INTO THE STREET NOW YOU MUST PUT YOUR BEST LEG FOREMOST OLD LADY
FOR THOUGH IT WAS COVERED UP THE BOY FELT THAT IT WAS A CORPSE THE MAN'S FACE WAS THIN AND VERY PALE HIS HAIR AND BEARD WERE GRIZZLY HIS EYES WERE BLOODSHOT
SEND ME A LARGE CLOAK A GOOD WARM ONE FOR IT IS BITTER COLD WE SHOULD HAVE CAKE AND WINE TOO BEFORE WE GO NEVER MIND SEND SOME BREAD
WOULD REDEEM HIS PLEDGE MOST HONOURABLY HE DREW BACK THE BOLTS WITH A TREMBLING HAND AND OPENED THE DOOR FOR A SECOND OR TWO OLIVER GLANCED UP THE STREET AND DOWN THE STREET AND OVER THE WAY
AS THE ATROCITY PRESENTED ITSELF TO MISTER BUMBLE'S MIND IN FULL FORCE HE STRUCK THE COUNTER SHARPLY WITH HIS CANE AND BECAME FLUSHED WITH INDIGNATION WELL
NO CHANCE CHILD WAS HE FOR HE COULD TRACE HIS GENEALOGY ALL THE WAY BACK TO HIS PARENTS WHO LIVED HARD BY HIS MOTHER BEING A WASHERWOMAN AND HIS FATHER A DRUNKEN SOLDIER DISCHARGED WITH A WOODEN LEG AND A DIURNAL PENSION OF TWOPENCE HALFPENNY AND AN UNSTATEABLE FRACTION
HE HAS OBSTRUCTED THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE BY REFUSING HIS ASSENT TO LAWS FOR ESTABLISHING JUDICIARY POWERS HE HAS MADE JUDGES DEPENDENT ON HIS WILL ALONE FOR THE TENURE OF THEIR OFFICES
LOVING THANKFUL WOMANLY ACTION BUT THE HAND MADE NO RESPONSE DROPPED COLD AND HEAVY AND TOOK TO ITS KNITTING AGAIN THERE WAS SOMETHING IN ITS TOUCH THAT GAVE LUCIE A CHECK
BUT TO USE IT IN HIS BEHALF O SISTER WOMAN THINK OF ME AS A WIFE AND MOTHER
JUDGE YOU IS IT LIKELY THAT THE TROUBLE OF ONE WIFE AND MOTHER WOULD BE MUCH TO US NOW SHE RESUMED HER KNITTING AND WENT OUT THE VENGEANCE FOLLOWED
OR WHEN THE FOUNDATIONS ARE INSECURE WITH THIS BEFORE ME BY WAY OF EXAMPLE I WAS PERSUADED THAT IT WOULD INDEED BE PREPOSTEROUS FOR A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL TO THINK OF REFORMING A STATE BY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING IT THROUGHOUT
FOR ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZED VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES IN THIS UNDERTAKING THESE WERE NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT REMEDY NOR ONCE TO BE COMPARED WITH SUCH AS ATTEND THE SLIGHTEST REFORMATION IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS LARGE BODIES
WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DEMUR BUT THE GREAT TRUST HE HELD WAS NOT HIS OWN AND AS TO THAT BUSINESS CHARGE
NOR IN THIS PERHAPS SHALL I APPEAR TOO VAIN IF IT BE CONSIDERED THAT AS THE TRUTH ON ANY PARTICULAR POINT IS ONE WHOEVER APPREHENDS THE TRUTH KNOWS ALL THAT ON THAT POINT CAN BE KNOWN
WAS THIS THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO IMPERIL TELLSON'S BY SHELTERING THE WIFE OF AN EMIGRANT PRISONER UNDER THE BANK ROOF HIS OWN POSSESSIONS SAFETY LIFE HE WOULD HAVE HAZARDED FOR LUCIE AND HER CHILD
MY MIND TO THE LOVE AND NOURISHMENT OF TRUTH AND TO A DISTASTE FOR ALL SUCH REASONINGS AS WERE UNSOUND BUT I HAD NO INTENTION ON THAT ACCOUNT OF ATTEMPTING TO MASTER ALL
I WAS ENABLED AS IT APPEARED TO ME TO DETERMINE THE MEANS WHEREBY AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH A SOLUTION WAS POSSIBLE
YOU WILL DO HIM NO HARM YOU WILL HELP ME TO SEE HIM IF YOU CAN YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT MY BUSINESS HERE RETURNED MADAME DEFARGE LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE IT IS THE DAUGHTER OF YOUR FATHER WHO IS MY BUSINESS HERE
MUCH INTERESTED AND AGITATED MISTER LORRY SAID
AND THAT MANY SUCH EXIST THE DIVERSITY OF CONSTITUTIONS IS ALONE SUFFICIENT TO ASSURE US CUSTOM HAS WITHOUT DOUBT MATERIALLY SMOOTHED THEIR INCONVENIENCES AND HAS EVEN MANAGED TO STEER ALTOGETHER CLEAR OF
WHO HAD BEEN UNEASILY BITING HIS THUMB NAIL AND LOOKING AT HER COLLECTED HIS FACE INTO A STERNER EXPRESSION WHAT IS IT THAT YOUR HUSBAND SAYS IN THAT LITTLE LETTER
AND CLOSED THE DOOR COURAGE MY DEAR LUCIE SAID MISTER LORRY AS HE RAISED HER COURAGE COURAGE SO FAR ALL GOES WELL WITH US
ALL WELL WITH CHARLES AND HE WERE TO BE RELEASED HE COULD NOT HOPE TO LEAVE THE CITY MISTER LORRY WENT OUT IN QUEST OF SUCH A LODGING AND FOUND A SUITABLE ONE HIGH UP IN A REMOVED BY STREET
AND OVERTURNING IT IN ORDER TO SET IT UP AMENDED AND THE SAME I THOUGHT WAS TRUE OF ANY SIMILAR PROJECT FOR REFORMING THE BODY OF THE SCIENCES OR THE ORDER OF TEACHING THEM ESTABLISHED IN THE SCHOOLS
HAS MUCH INFLUENCE AROUND HIM SURELY IT WILL RELEASE HIM SAID MADAME DEFARGE LET IT DO SO
AND WITHOUT BY ANY MEANS RESTRICTING THEM TO THESE THAT AFTERWARDS I MIGHT THUS BE THE BETTER ABLE TO APPLY THEM TO EVERY OTHER CLASS OF OBJECTS TO WHICH THEY ARE LEGITIMATELY APPLICABLE
IN WHICH I FOUND NOTHING CERTAIN I THOUGHT IT NECESSARY FIRST OF ALL TO ENDEAVOR TO ESTABLISH ITS PRINCIPLES AND BECAUSE I OBSERVED
A SHADOW INDEED NO SUBSTANCE IN IT LUCIE BUT THE SHADOW OF THE MANNER OF THESE DEFARGES WAS DARK UPON HIMSELF FOR ALL THAT
WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO SEE THAT PRIVATE BUILDINGS CONTRIBUTED TO PUBLIC ORNAMENT THE DIFFICULTY OF REACHING HIGH PERFECTION WITH BUT THE MATERIALS OF OTHERS TO OPERATE ON WILL BE READILY ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE SAME WAY
WHO HAD LEFT HER IN EXACTLY THE SAME ATTITUDE SOME SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO IT IS SHE OBSERVED HER HUSBAND DOES MADAME GO WITH US INQUIRED MISTER LORRY SEEING THAT SHE MOVED AS THEY MOVED
AS IT WERE TO USE MY OWN REASON IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE BUT LIKE ONE WALKING ALONE AND IN THE DARK I RESOLVED TO PROCEED SO SLOWLY AND WITH SUCH CIRCUMSPECTION
AND AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR ITS ADEQUATE SOLUTION THE THIRD TO CONDUCT MY THOUGHTS IN SUCH ORDER THAT BY COMMENCING WITH OBJECTS THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW
REPUDIATED HIM HE LIVED IN THE MOST VIOLENT QUARTER AND DOUBTLESS WAS INFLUENTIAL THERE AND DEEP IN ITS DANGEROUS WORKINGS NOON COMING AND THE DOCTOR NOT RETURNING
I FANCIED THAT THOSE NATIONS WHICH STARTING FROM A SEMI BARBAROUS STATE AND ADVANCING TO CIVILIZATION BY SLOW DEGREES HAVE HAD THEIR LAWS SUCCESSIVELY DETERMINED AND AS IT WERE
THE PARTICULAR SCIENCES COMMONLY DENOMINATED MATHEMATICS BUT OBSERVING THAT HOWEVER DIFFERENT THEIR OBJECTS THEY ALL AGREE IN CONSIDERING ONLY THE VARIOUS RELATIONS OR PROPORTIONS
BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS I WAS INDUCED TO SEEK SOME OTHER METHOD WHICH WOULD COMPRISE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE THREE AND BE EXEMPT FROM THEIR DEFECTS AND AS A MULTITUDE OF LAWS OFTEN ONLY HAMPERS JUSTICE
I RESOLVED TO COMMENCE THEREFORE WITH THE EXAMINATION OF THE SIMPLEST OBJECTS NOT ANTICIPATING HOWEVER FROM THIS ANY OTHER ADVANTAGE THAN THAT TO BE FOUND IN ACCUSTOMING
AND BY WHOM THEY MAY BE INSTRUCTED OUGHT RATHER TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THE OPINIONS OF SUCH THAN TRUST FOR MORE CORRECT TO THEIR OWN REASON FOR MY OWN PART
WITH DARK CURLING HAIR FROM FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY YEARS OF AGE FOR ANSWER HE REPEATED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF EMPHASIS THE WORDS DO YOU KNOW ME I HAVE SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE PERHAPS AT MY WINE SHOP
MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN IT HAS OF LATE GONE WITH MANY POOR SOULS CHEER UP AND HAVE A THANKFUL HEART I AM NOT THANKLESS I HOPE
YES I COME FROM DOCTOR MANETTE AND WHAT SAYS HE WHAT DOES HE SEND ME
BUT AS FOR THE OPINIONS WHICH UP TO THAT TIME I HAD EMBRACED I THOUGHT THAT I COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN RESOLVE AT ONCE TO SWEEP THEM WHOLLY AWAY THAT I MIGHT AFTERWARDS BE IN A POSITION TO ADMIT EITHER OTHERS MORE CORRECT
WHICH I DID NOT CLEARLY KNOW TO BE SUCH THAT IS TO SAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID PRECIPITANCY AND PREJUDICE AND TO COMPRISE NOTHING MORE IN MY JUDGEMENT THAN WHAT WAS PRESENTED
INFLUENCE HE SAYS SOMETHING TOUCHING INFLUENCE
AND BY CONTINUALLY EXERCISING MYSELF IN MY CHOSEN METHOD
I THOUGHT THAT IN ORDER THE BETTER TO CONSIDER THEM INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD VIEW THEM AS SUBSISTING BETWEEN STRAIGHT LINES THAN WHICH I COULD FIND NO OBJECTS MORE SIMPLE
WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF MEN OF THIS CLASS ONCE TAKE THE LIBERTY TO DOUBT OF THEIR ACCUSTOMED OPINIONS AND QUIT THE BEATEN HIGHWAY THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO THREAD THE BYWAY THAT WOULD LEAD THEM BY A SHORTER COURSE
I STATE THE CASE CITIZEN DEFARGE
THE CHILD FOR EXAMPLE WHO HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE ELEMENTS OF ARITHMETIC AND HAS MADE A PARTICULAR ADDITION ACCORDING TO RULE
KISS OUR CHILD FOR ME THAT WAS ALL THE WRITING IT WAS SO MUCH HOWEVER TO HER WHO RECEIVED IT
THEN AS TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE ANCIENTS AND THE ALGEBRA OF THE MODERNS BESIDES THAT THEY EMBRACE ONLY MATTERS HIGHLY ABSTRACT AND TO APPEARANCE OF NO USE THE FORMER IS SO EXCLUSIVELY RESTRICTED
YES THAT SHE MAY BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE THE FACES AND KNOW THE PERSONS IT IS FOR THEIR SAFETY BEGINNING TO BE STRUCK BY DEFARGE'S MANNER MISTER LORRY LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIM AND LED THE WAY
BUT I HAD BECOME AWARE EVEN SO EARLY AS DURING MY COLLEGE LIFE THAT NO OPINION HOWEVER ABSURD AND INCREDIBLE CAN BE IMAGINED WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MAINTAINED BY SOME ON OF THE PHILOSOPHERS AND AFTERWARDS
OR CAPABLE OF BEING MORE DISTINCTLY REPRESENTED TO MY IMAGINATION AND SENSES AND ON THE OTHER HAND THAT IN ORDER TO RETAIN THEM IN THE MEMORY OR EMBRACE AN AGGREGATE OF MANY I SHOULD EXPRESS THEM BY CERTAIN CHARACTERS
EITHER INJURIOUS OR SUPERFLUOUS MINGLED WITH THE FORMER THAT IT IS ALMOST QUITE AS DIFFICULT TO EFFECT A SEVERANCE OF THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE AS IT IS TO EXTRACT A DIANA OR A MINERVA FROM A ROUGH BLOCK OF MARBLE
ARE GENERALLY MORE ELEGANT AND COMMODIOUS THAN THOSE WHICH SEVERAL HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IMPROVE
I SHOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BELONGED TO THE LATTER CLASS HAD I RECEIVED INSTRUCTION FROM BUT ONE MASTER OR HAD I NEVER KNOWN THE DIVERSITIES OF OPINION THAT FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL HAVE PREVAILED AMONG MEN OF THE GREATEST LEARNING
TO THE VENGEANCE WHOM HER EYES FIRST ENCOUNTERED WELL I AM SURE BOLDFACE I HOPE
PROBABLE REASONINGS WITHOUT DEMONSTRATIONS COMPOSED AS THEY ARE OF THE OPINIONS OF MANY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS MASSED TOGETHER ARE FARTHER REMOVED FROM TRUTH THAN THE SIMPLE INFERENCES WHICH A MAN OF GOOD SENSE
OFTEN ENOUGH ALL OUR LIVES WE HAVE SEEN OUR SISTER WOMEN SUFFER IN THEMSELVES AND IN THEIR CHILDREN POVERTY NAKEDNESS HUNGER THIRST SICKNESS
AND TO SPEAK OF HUMAN AFFAIRS I BELIEVE THAT THE PRE EMINENCE OF SPARTA WAS DUE NOT TO THE GOODNESS OF EACH OF ITS LAWS IN PARTICULAR FOR MANY OF THESE WERE VERY STRANGE AND EVEN OPPOSED TO GOOD MORALS BUT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT
MISERY OPPRESSION AND NEGLECT OF ALL KINDS WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING ELSE RETURNED THE VENGEANCE
AND IN POINT OF FACT THE ACCURATE OBSERVANCE OF THESE FEW PRECEPTS GAVE ME I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF SAYING SUCH EASE IN UNRAVELING ALL THE QUESTIONS EMBRACED IN THESE TWO SCIENCES
FOR NEITHER OF WHICH WOULD THIS BE AT ALL A BEFITTING RESOLUTION IN THE FIRST PLACE OF THOSE WHO WITH MORE THAN A DUE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN POWERS ARE PRECIPITATE IN THEIR JUDGMENTS AND WANT THE PATIENCE REQUISITE FOR ORDERLY AND CIRCUMSPECT THINKING
THE SINGLE DESIGN TO STRIP ONE'S SELF OF ALL PAST BELIEFS IS ONE THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE TAKEN BY EVERY ONE THE MAJORITY OF MEN IS COMPOSED OF TWO CLASSES
AND THE MAJORITY OF ITS OTHER PRECEPTS ARE OF AVAIL RATHER IN THE COMMUNICATION OF WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW OR EVEN AS THE ART OF LULLY IN SPEAKING WITHOUT JUDGMENT OF THINGS OF WHICH WE ARE IGNORANT THAN IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE UNKNOWN
OR WITH SAVAGES AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN DRESS ITSELF THE FASHION WHICH PLEASED US TEN YEARS AGO AND WHICH MAY AGAIN PERHAPS BE RECEIVED INTO FAVOR BEFORE TEN YEARS HAVE GONE APPEARS TO US AT THIS MOMENT EXTRAVAGANT
TO MY MIND SO CLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY AS TO EXCLUDE ALL GROUND OF DOUBT THE SECOND
SUBSISTING AMONG THOSE OBJECTS I THOUGHT IT BEST FOR MY PURPOSE TO CONSIDER THESE PROPORTIONS IN THE MOST GENERAL FORM POSSIBLE WITHOUT REFERRING THEM TO ANY OBJECTS IN PARTICULAR
AND THEREBY RENDERING THE STREETS MORE HANDSOME BUT IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL TAKES DOWN HIS OWN WITH THE VIEW OF ERECTING IT ANEW AND THAT PEOPLE ARE EVEN SOMETIMES CONSTRAINED TO THIS WHEN THEIR HOUSES ARE IN DANGER OF FALLING FROM AGE
AT LITTLE LUCIE AS IF IT WERE THE FINGER OF FATE YES MADAME ANSWERED MISTER LORRY THIS IS OUR POOR PRISONER'S DARLING DAUGHTER AND ONLY CHILD
SHE STOPPED IN THE ACT OF PUTTING THE NOTE IN HER BOSOM AND WITH HER HANDS YET AT HER NECK LOOKED TERRIFIED AT MADAME DEFARGE
TO THE END THAT SHE MAY KNOW THEM THAT SHE MAY IDENTIFY THEM I BELIEVE SAID MISTER LORRY RATHER HALTING IN HIS REASSURING WORDS AS THE STONY MANNER OF ALL THE THREE IMPRESSED ITSELF UPON HIM MORE AND MORE
IN A FEW MOMENTS A MAN STOOD IN HIS PRESENCE WHO WITH A KEENLY OBSERVANT LOOK AT HIM ADDRESSED HIM BY HIS NAME YOUR SERVANT SAID MISTER LORRY DO YOU KNOW ME HE WAS A STRONGLY MADE MAN
THE LONG CHAINS OF SIMPLE AND EASY REASONINGS BY MEANS OF WHICH GEOMETERS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO REACH THE CONCLUSIONS OF THEIR MOST DIFFICULT DEMONSTRATIONS
AND WAS BESIDES FORTUNATELY UNDISTURBED BY ANY CARES OR PASSIONS I REMAINED THE WHOLE DAY IN SECLUSION WITH FULL OPPORTUNITY TO OCCUPY MY ATTENTION WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS
AND ALTHOUGH THIS SCIENCE CONTAINS INDEED A NUMBER OF CORRECT AND VERY EXCELLENT PRECEPTS THERE ARE NEVERTHELESS SO MANY OTHERS AND THESE
IN THIS INSTANCE IS WITHIN THE REACH OF HUMAN GENIUS NOW IN CONCLUSION THE METHOD WHICH TEACHES ADHERENCE TO THE TRUE ORDER AND AN EXACT ENUMERATION OF ALL THE CONDITIONS OF THE THING SOUGHT
FOR THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTRARY TO THE ORDER PRESCRIBED IN THE METHOD
HAVE FOLLOWED THE APPOINTMENTS OF SOME WISE LEGISLATOR IT IS THUS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE TRUE RELIGION THE ORDINANCES OF WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM GOD MUST BE INCOMPARABLY SUPERIOR TO THAT OF EVERY OTHER
HAD LED ME TO IMAGINE THAT ALL THINGS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH MAN IS COMPETENT ARE MUTUALLY CONNECTED IN THE SAME WAY AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING SO FAR REMOVED FROM US AS TO BE BEYOND OUR REACH OR SO HIDDEN
THAT BY ITS USE MY MIND WAS BECOMING GRADUALLY HABITUATED TO CLEARER AND MORE DISTINCT CONCEPTIONS OF ITS OBJECTS AND I HOPED ALSO FROM NOT HAVING RESTRICTED THIS METHOD TO ANY PARTICULAR MATTER TO APPLY IT TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE OTHER SCIENCES
INCLUDES ALL THAT GIVES CERTITUDE TO THE RULES OF ARITHMETIC BUT THE CHIEF GROUND OF MY SATISFACTION WITH THUS METHOD
AMONG THE BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY I HAD AT AN EARLIER PERIOD GIVEN SOME ATTENTION TO LOGIC AND AMONG THOSE OF THE MATHEMATICS TO GEOMETRICAL ANALYSIS AND ALGEBRA
AND THE CHILD IT IS ENOUGH MY HUSBAND SAID MADAME DEFARGE I HAVE SEEN THEM WE MAY GO BUT THE SUPPRESSED MANNER HAD ENOUGH OF MENACE IN IT
I MIGHT ASCEND BY LITTLE AND LITTLE AND AS IT WERE STEP BY STEP TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MORE COMPLEX ASSIGNING IN THOUGHT A CERTAIN ORDER EVEN TO THOSE OBJECTS WHICH IN THEIR OWN NATURE DO NOT STAND IN A RELATION OF ANTECEDENCE AND SEQUENCE
AS A FIGURE TO FILL A DOORWAY THAT WOULD BEAR CONSIDERABLE KNOCKING ON THE HEAD AND RETAINED TO HIS OWN OCCUPATIONS A DISTURBED AND DOLEFUL MIND HE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON THEM AND SLOWLY AND HEAVILY THE DAY LAGGED ON WITH HIM
THREE ARTS OR SCIENCES WHICH OUGHT AS I CONCEIVED TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING TO MY DESIGN BUT ON EXAMINATION I FOUND THAT AS FOR LOGIC ITS SYLLOGISMS
CHARLES IS SAFE BUT I CANNOT SAFELY LEAVE THIS PLACE YET I HAVE OBTAINED THE FAVOUR THAT THE BEARER HAS A SHORT NOTE FROM CHARLES TO HIS WIFE
SO THAT A STATE IS BEST GOVERNED WHEN WITH FEW LAWS THESE ARE RIGIDLY ADMINISTERED IN LIKE MANNER INSTEAD OF THE GREAT NUMBER OF PRECEPTS OF WHICH LOGIC IS COMPOSED I BELIEVED THAT THE FOUR FOLLOWING WOULD PROVE PERFECTLY SUFFICIENT FOR ME
ARE USUALLY BUT ILL LAID OUT COMPARED WITH THE REGULARITY CONSTRUCTED TOWNS WHICH A PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT HAS FREELY PLANNED ON AN OPEN PLAIN SO THAT ALTHOUGH THE SEVERAL BUILDINGS OF THE FORMER
THE BRIEFEST POSSIBLE IN THIS WAY I BELIEVED THAT I COULD BORROW ALL THAT WAS BEST BOTH IN GEOMETRICAL ANALYSIS AND IN ALGEBRA AND CORRECT ALL THE DEFECTS OF THE ONE BY HELP OF THE OTHER
UPON WHICH DIFFERENT HANDS HAD BEEN EMPLOYED AS IN THOSE COMPLETED BY A SINGLE MASTER THUS IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT THE BUILDINGS WHICH A SINGLE ARCHITECT HAS PLANNED AND EXECUTED
AND HE THOUGHT OF FINDING OUT THE WINE SHOP AGAIN AND TAKING COUNSEL WITH ITS MASTER IN REFERENCE TO THE SAFEST DWELLING PLACE IN THE DISTRACTED STATE OF THE CITY BUT THE SAME CONSIDERATION THAT SUGGESTED HIM
RESULTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I COMMENCED WITH THE SIMPLEST AND MOST GENERAL TRUTHS AND THAT THUS EACH TRUTH DISCOVERED WAS A RULE AVAILABLE IN THE DISCOVERY OF SUBSEQUENT ONES
IN THE SAME WAY I THOUGHT THAT THE SCIENCES CONTAINED IN BOOKS
AND THE LAST IN EVERY CASE TO MAKE ENUMERATIONS SO COMPLETE AND REVIEWS SO GENERAL THAT I MIGHT BE ASSURED THAT NOTHING WAS OMITTED
I TOOK INTO ACCOUNT ALSO THE VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTER WHICH A PERSON BROUGHT UP FROM INFANCY IN FRANCE OR GERMANY EXHIBITS FROM THAT WHICH
THAT IN THE TWO OR THREE MONTHS I DEVOTED TO THEIR EXAMINATION NOT ONLY DID I REACH SOLUTIONS OF QUESTIONS I HAD FORMERLY DEEMED EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT BUT EVEN AS REGARDS QUESTIONS OF THE SOLUTION OF WHICH I CONTINUED IGNORANT
I HAVE NEVER CONTEMPLATED ANYTHING HIGHER THAN THE REFORMATION OF MY OWN OPINIONS AND BASING THEM ON A FOUNDATION WHOLLY MY OWN AND ALTHOUGH MY OWN SATISFACTION WITH MY WORK HAS LED ME TO PRESENT HERE A DRAFT OF IT
I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS THEREFORE RECOMMEND TO EVERY ONE ELSE TO MAKE A SIMILAR ATTEMPT THOSE WHOM GOD HAS ENDOWED WITH A LARGER MEASURE OF GENIUS WILL ENTERTAIN PERHAPS DESIGNS STILL MORE EXALTED
LITTLE THINKING WHAT IT HAD BEEN DOING NEAR HIM IN THE NIGHT AND MIGHT BUT FOR A CHANCE HAVE DONE TO HIM DEAREST TAKE COURAGE I AM WELL AND YOUR FATHER HAS INFLUENCE AROUND ME YOU CANNOT ANSWER THIS
I SHOULD MUCH BETTER SUCCEED IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE THAN IF I BUILT ONLY UPON OLD FOUNDATIONS AND LEANED UPON PRINCIPLES WHICH IN MY YOUTH I HAD TAKEN UPON TRUST
PERCEIVING FURTHER THAT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THESE RELATIONS I SHOULD SOMETIMES HAVE TO CONSIDER THEM ONE BY ONE AND SOMETIMES ONLY TO BEAR THEM IN MIND OR EMBRACE THEM IN THE AGGREGATE
I HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE OBJECTS WITH WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO COMMENCE FOR I WAS ALREADY PERSUADED THAT IT MUST BE WITH THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW AND CONSIDERING THAT OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE HITHERTO SOUGHT
OR INSENSIBLY CORRECTED A NUMBER WHICH SAGACITY COULD NOT HAVE PROVIDED AGAINST WITH EQUAL EFFECT AND IN FINE THE DEFECTS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS MORE TOLERABLE
USING HIS NATURAL AND UNPREJUDICED JUDGMENT DRAWS RESPECTING THE MATTERS OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL TO PASS THROUGH A STATE OF INFANCY TO MANHOOD AND HAVE BEEN OF NECESSITY FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
THAT WE CANNOT DISCOVER IT PROVIDED ONLY WE ABSTAIN FROM ACCEPTING THE FALSE FOR THE TRUE AND ALWAYS PRESERVE IN OUR THOUGHTS THE ORDER NECESSARY FOR THE DEDUCTION OF ONE TRUTH FROM ANOTHER AND
BOTH THE WOMEN FOLLOWED THE SECOND WOMAN BEING THE VENGEANCE THEY PASSED THROUGH THE INTERVENING STREETS AS QUICKLY AS THEY MIGHT ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE OF THE NEW DOMICILE WERE ADMITTED BY JERRY AND FOUND LUCIE WEEPING
EMPLOYED MUCH OF MY TIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE WORK AS WELL BY ERADICATING FROM MY MIND ALL THE ERRONEOUS OPINIONS I HAD UP TO THAT MOMENT ACCEPTED AS BY AMASSING VARIETY OF EXPERIENCE TO AFFORD MATERIALS FOR MY REASONINGS
THAT I CANNOT IN ANY DEGREE APPROVE OF THOSE RESTLESS AND BUSY MEDDLERS WHO CALLED NEITHER BY BIRTH NOR FORTUNE TO TAKE PART IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS ARE YET ALWAYS PROJECTING REFORMS
IF ONCE OVERTHROWN ARE WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY SET UP AGAIN OR EVEN KEPT ERECT WHEN ONCE SERIOUSLY SHAKEN AND THE FALL OF SUCH IS ALWAYS DISASTROUS THEN IF THERE ARE ANY IMPERFECTIONS IN THE CONSTITUTIONS OF STATES
GOVERNED BY OUR DESIRES AND PRECEPTORS WHOSE DICTATES WERE FREQUENTLY CONFLICTING WHILE NEITHER PERHAPS ALWAYS COUNSELED US FOR THE BEST I FARTHER CONCLUDED THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT OUR JUDGMENTS CAN BE SO CORRECT OR SOLID
AND WILL LOSE THEMSELVES AND CONTINUE TO WANDER FOR LIFE IN THE SECOND PLACE OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED OF SUFFICIENT SENSE OR MODESTY TO DETERMINE THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO EXCEL THEM IN THE POWER OF DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN TRUTH AND ERROR
AND THEY WENT DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD THERE THEY FOUND TWO WOMEN ONE KNITTING
TUT TUT SAID MISTER LORRY
AND IF I THOUGHT THAT THIS TRACT CONTAINED AUGHT WHICH MIGHT JUSTIFY THE SUSPICION THAT I WAS A VICTIM OF SUCH FOLLY I WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT ITS PUBLICATION
WAS THE ASSURANCE I HAD OF THEREBY EXERCISING MY REASON IN ALL MATTERS IF NOT WITH ABSOLUTE PERFECTION AT LEAST WITH THE GREATEST ATTAINABLE BY ME BESIDES I WAS CONSCIOUS
IT WORE ITSELF OUT AND WORE HIM OUT WITH IT UNTIL THE BANK CLOSED HE WAS AGAIN ALONE IN HIS ROOM OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT CONSIDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT WHEN HE HEARD A FOOT UPON THE STAIR
AND ONE IN WHICH PRECIPITANCY AND ANTICIPATION IN JUDGMENT WERE MOST TO BE DREADED I THOUGHT THAT I OUGHT NOT TO APPROACH IT TILL I HAD REACHED A MORE MATURE AGE BEING AT THAT TIME BUT TWENTY THREE
CAREFULLY TO SATISFY MYSELF OF THE GENERAL NATURE OF THE TASK I WAS SETTING MYSELF AND ASCERTAIN THE TRUE METHOD BY WHICH TO ARRIVE AT THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHATEVER LAY WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY POWERS
WHOSE OPINIONS ARE DECIDEDLY REPUGNANT TO OURS ARE NOT IN THAT ACCOUNT BARBARIANS AND SAVAGES BUT ON THE CONTRARY THAT MANY OF THESE NATIONS MAKE AN EQUALLY GOOD IF NOT BETTER USE OF THEIR REASON THAN WE DO
PART TWO I WAS THEN IN GERMANY ATTRACTED THITHER BY THE WARS IN THAT COUNTRY WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN BROUGHT TO A TERMINATION AND AS I WAS RETURNING TO THE ARMY FROM THE CORONATION OF THE EMPEROR
MAY OFTEN EQUAL OR SURPASS IN BEAUTY THOSE OF THE LATTER YET WHEN ONE OBSERVES THEIR INDISCRIMINATE JUXTAPOSITION
AND EVERY MINUTE'S DELAY TENDING TO COMPROMISE TELLSON'S MISTER LORRY ADVISED WITH LUCIE SHE SAID THAT HER FATHER HAD SPOKEN OF HIRING A LODGING FOR A SHORT TERM IN THAT QUARTER NEAR THE BANKING HOUSE AS THERE WAS NO BUSINESS OBJECTION TO THIS
THE FELLOW DESIGNATED REACHED DOWN TWO OR THREE HANDS AND LIFTED ME UP BEHIND HIM ON THE GLOSSY BACK OF HIS MOUNT
MY ATTEMPTS TO WALK RESULTED IN A VARIETY OF HOPS WHICH TOOK ME CLEAR OF THE GROUND A COUPLE OF FEET AT EACH STEP AND LANDED ME SPRAWLING UPON MY FACE OR BACK
SOME WERE SURVEYING ME WITH EXPRESSIONS WHICH I AFTERWARD DISCOVERED MARKED EXTREME ASTONISHMENT AND THE OTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY SATISFYING THEMSELVES THAT I HAD NOT MOLESTED THEIR YOUNG
I SAW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER AND GATHERING MYSELF TOGETHER I SAKKED WITH SUCH MARVELOUS SUCCESS THAT I CLEARED A GOOD HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET NOR DID I THIS TIME LOSE MY EQUILIBRIUM BUT LANDED SQUARELY UPON MY FEET
AS HE SUNK TO THE FLOOR I WHEELED AROUND WITH MY BACK TOWARD THE NEAREST DESK EXPECTING TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FELLOWS BUT DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM AS GOOD A BATTLE AS THE UNEQUAL ODDS WOULD PERMIT BEFORE I GAVE UP MY LIFE
MAKING THESE WEAPONS PRESENT A SINGULARLY FORMIDABLE APPEARANCE MOST OF THESE DETAILS I NOTED LATER FOR I WAS GIVEN BUT LITTLE TIME TO SPECULATE ON THE WONDERS OF MY NEW DISCOVERY
THE WHITENESS OF THE TEETH IS NOT THAT OF IVORY BUT OF THE SNOWIEST AND MOST GLEAMING OF CHINA AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF THEIR OLIVE SKINS THEIR TUSKS STAND OUT IN A MOST STRIKING MANNER
AND THERE UPON ME NOT TEN FEET FROM MY BREAST WAS THE POINT OF THAT HUGE SPEAR A SPEAR FORTY FEET LONG TIPPED WITH GLEAMING METAL AND HELD LOW AT THE SIDE OF A MOUNTED REPLICA
AND SOME TELEPATHIC FORCE MUST HAVE WARNED ME AGAINST AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT FROM UNDER THE MUZZLES OF TWENTY OF THESE DEATH DEALING MACHINES
ABOUT THIS ASSEMBLAGE AND THE HALL IN WHICH THEY WERE CONGREGATED WAS THE FACT THAT THE CREATURES WERE ENTIRELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE DESKS CHAIRS AND OTHER FURNISHINGS THESE BEING OF A SIZE ADAPTED TO HUMAN BEINGS SUCH AS I
IS TO INFLICT DEATH ON THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR IN VARIOUS INGENIOUS AND HORRIBLE WAYS THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS AND CHIEFTAINS EXAMINED ME CLOSELY FEELING MY MUSCLES AND THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN
THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUE UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS ON AN ARIZONA DESERT HERE AND THERE WERE SLIGHT OUTCROPPINGS OF QUARTZ BEARING ROCK WHICH GLISTENED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE TO MY LEFT PERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS APPEARED A LOW WALLED ENCLOSURE
I WAS NOT ASLEEP NO NEED FOR PINCHING HERE MY INNER CONSCIOUSNESS TOLD ME AS PLAINLY THAT I WAS UPON MARS AS YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE UPON EARTH YOU DO NOT QUESTION THE FACT
STILLED THEIR CLAMOR AND WE PROCEEDED AT A TROT ACROSS THE PLAZA TO THE ENTRANCE OF AS MAGNIFICENT AN EDIFICE AS MORTAL EYE HAS RESTED UPON THE BUILDING WAS LOW BUT COVERED AN ENORMOUS AREA
AS I TURNED TO MEET IT UNARMED AND NAKED AS I WAS THE FIRST LAW OF NATURE MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF MY IMMEDIATE PROBLEM AND THAT WAS TO GET OUT OF THE VICINITY
THE IRREGULARITIES OF LOW HILLS IT WAS MIDDAY THE SUN WAS SHINING FULL UPON ME AND THE HEAT OF IT WAS RATHER INTENSE UPON MY NAKED BODY YET NO GREATER
WHICH THEY EVIDENTLY WOULD NOT VOLUNTARILY ACCORD I THEREFORE IGNORED THE REPEATED COMMANDS TO SAK AND EACH TIME THEY WERE MADE I MOTIONED TO MY MOUTH AND RUBBED MY STOMACH
THEY ARE DEADLY IN THE EXTREME
IT HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN ME TO SEE THE ROOF OF THE ENCLOSURE WAS OF SOLID GLASS
AND SO HUMAN LIFE HAS COME TO BE CONSIDERED BUT LIGHTLY ON MARS AS IS EVIDENCED BY THEIR DANGEROUS SPORTS AND THE ALMOST CONTINUAL WARFARE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES
IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OF GLEAMING WHITE MARBLE INLAID WITH GOLD AND BRILLIANT STONES WHICH SPARKLED AND SCINTILLATED IN THE SUNLIGHT THE MAIN ENTRANCE WAS SOME HUNDRED FEET IN WIDTH AND PROJECTED FROM THE BUILDING PROPER
UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION I SAW AS WE PASSED THEM THAT THE BUILDINGS WERE DESERTED AND WHILE NOT GREATLY DECAYED HAD THE APPEARANCE OF NOT HAVING BEEN TENANTED FOR YEARS POSSIBLY FOR AGES
TRAILED NINETEEN OTHERS SIMILAR IN ALL RESPECTS BUT AS I LEARNED LATER BEARING INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES PRECISELY
HIS ACTIONS SPOKE FOR THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WERE MOST DEAR TO MY HEART OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BABBLING BROOK FOR ALL THE INTELLIGENCE MY SPEECH CARRIED TO HIM
MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE MARTIANS HAD TAKEN PLACE IN A SHORT TIME WE GAINED THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND AFTER TRAVERSING A NARROW GORGE CAME TO AN OPEN VALLEY AT THE FAR EXTREMITY OF WHICH WAS A LOW TABLE LAND UPON WHICH I BEHELD
MY EFFORT WAS CROWNED WITH A SUCCESS WHICH APPALLED ME NO LESS THAN IT SEEMED TO SURPRISE THE MARTIAN WARRIORS FOR IT CARRIED ME FULLY THIRTY FEET INTO THE AIR AND LANDED ME A HUNDRED FEET
HOW CAN EARTHLY WORDS DESCRIBE IT IT TOWERED TEN FEET AT THE SHOULDER HAD FOUR LEGS ON EITHER SIDE A BROAD FLAT TAIL LARGER AT THE TIP THAN AT THE ROOT AND WHICH IT HELD
OF THE POINT OF THE CHARGING SPEAR CONSEQUENTLY I GAVE A VERY EARTHLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SUPERHUMAN LEAP TO REACH THE TOP OF THE MARTIAN INCUBATOR FOR SUCH I HAD DETERMINED IT MUST BE
ITS BELLY WAS WHITE AND ITS LEGS SHADED FROM THE SLATE OF ITS SHOULDERS AND HIPS TO A VIVID YELLOW AT THE FEET THE FEET THEMSELVES WERE HEAVILY PADDED AND NAILLESS
AS THE MUSCULAR EXERTION WHICH CARRIED ME EASILY AND SAFELY UPON EARTH PLAYED STRANGE ANTICS WITH ME UPON MARS INSTEAD OF PROGRESSING IN A SANE AND DIGNIFIED MANNER
THEREFORE TO LAUGH DENOTING A SENSE OF HUMOR BUT I WAS TO LEARN THAT THE MARTIAN SMILE IS MERELY PERFUNCTORY AND THAT THE MARTIAN LAUGH IS A THING TO CAUSE STRONG MEN TO BLANCH IN HORROR THE IDEAS
WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TURNING THE HEAD THE EARS WHICH WERE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE EYES AND CLOSER TOGETHER WERE SMALL CUP SHAPED ANTENNAE PROTRUDING NOT MORE THAN AN INCH ON THESE YOUNG SPECIMENS
OWING TO THE WANING RESOURCES OF THE PLANET IT EVIDENTLY BECAME NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE INCREASING LONGEVITY WHICH THEIR REMARKABLE SKILL IN THERAPEUTICS AND SURGERY PRODUCED
AN ENORMOUS CITY TOWARD THIS WE GALLOPED ENTERING IT BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A RUINED ROADWAY LEADING OUT FROM THE CITY BUT ONLY TO THE EDGE OF THE TABLE LAND WHERE IT ENDED ABRUPTLY IN A FLIGHT OF BROAD STEPS
WITHOUT FALLING I THEN RETURNED BY EASY JUMPS OF TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY FEET TO THE LITTLE GROUP OF WARRIORS MY EXHIBITION HAD BEEN WITNESSED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED LESSER MARTIANS AND THEY IMMEDIATELY BROKE INTO DEMANDS FOR A REPETITION
WHICH WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE ON EARTH THE THEORETIC EFFECTIVE RADIUS OF THIS RIFLE IS THREE HUNDRED MILES BUT THE BEST THEY CAN DO IN ACTUAL SERVICE
WHEN I HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR CUSTOMS I LEARNED THAT I HAD WON WHAT THEY SELDOM ACCORD A MANIFESTATION OF APPROBATION THE FELLOW WHOM I HAD STRUCK LAY WHERE HE HAD FALLEN
SHE WAS OF A LIGHT OLIVE GREEN COLOR WITH A SMOOTH GLOSSY HIDE HER NAME AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS SOLA AND SHE BELONGED TO THE RETINUE OF TARS TARKAS SHE CONDUCTED ME TO A SPACIOUS CHAMBER
AS TO STRIKE AGAINST THE BUTT OF HIS GREAT METAL SHOD SPEAR I SHOULD HAVE SNUFFED OUT WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THAT DEATH WAS NEAR ME BUT THE LITTLE SOUND CAUSED ME TO TURN
AND BENEATH THIS WERE SEVERAL HUNDRED LARGE EGGS PERFECTLY ROUND AND SNOWY WHITE THE EGGS WERE NEARLY UNIFORM IN SIZE BEING ABOUT TWO AND ONE HALF FEET IN DIAMETER FIVE OR SIX HAD ALREADY HATCHED
HE SAT HIS MOUNT AS WE SIT A HORSE GRASPING THE ANIMAL'S BARREL WITH HIS LOWER LIMBS WHILE THE HANDS OF HIS TWO RIGHT ARMS HELD HIS IMMENSE SPEAR LOW AT THE SIDE OF HIS MOUNT
AT THE SAME TIME HE MOTIONED HIS FOLLOWERS TO ADVANCE THEY STARTED TOWARD US ON A WILD RUN
WHEN THEY HAD COVERED PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED YARDS THEY HALTED AND TURNING THEIR MOUNTS TOWARD US SAT WATCHING THE WARRIOR BY THE ENCLOSURE HE WAS THE ONE WHOSE SPEAR HAD SO NEARLY TRANSFIXED ME
MY MUSCLES PERFECTLY ATTUNED AND ACCUSTOMED TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ON EARTH PLAYED THE MISCHIEF WITH ME IN ATTEMPTING FOR THE FIRST TIME TO COPE WITH THE LESSER GRAVITATION AND LOWER AIR PRESSURE ON MARS
GAY COLORED FEATHERS AND BEAUTIFULLY WROUGHT LEATHER TRAPPINGS INGENIOUSLY SET WITH PRECIOUS STONES FROM HIS SHOULDERS DEPENDED A SHORT CAPE OF WHITE FUR LINED WITH BRILLIANT SCARLET SILK WHAT STRUCK ME AS MOST REMARKABLE
WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
TARS TARKAS AND THE CHIEF EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS AND THE FORMER CALLING TO A YOUNG FEMALE AMONG THE THRONG GAVE HER SOME INSTRUCTIONS AND MOTIONED ME TO ACCOMPANY HER
THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A MARTIAN AFTER THE AGE OF MATURITY IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BUT WOULD BE NEARER THE ONE THOUSAND MARK WERE IT NOT FOR THE VARIOUS MEANS LEADING TO VIOLENT DEATH
CHAPTER FOUR A PRISONER WE HAD GONE PERHAPS TEN MILES WHEN THE GROUND BEGAN TO RISE VERY RAPIDLY WE WERE AS I WAS LATER TO LEARN NEARING THE EDGE OF ONE OF MARS LONG DEAD SEAS IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH
MADE A PECULIAR HISSING SOUND AS THOUGH SIGNALING TO SOMEONE IN AN ADJOINING ROOM IN RESPONSE TO HER CALL I OBTAINED MY FIRST SIGHT OF A NEW MARTIAN WONDER IT WADDLED IN ON ITS TEN SHORT LEGS AND SQUATTED DOWN BEFORE THE GIRL
AND I DOUBT THAT WERE ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY TO BE TRANSPORTED TO EARTH HE COULD LIFT HIS OWN WEIGHT FROM THE GROUND IN FACT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO MY FEAT THEN WAS AS MARVELOUS UPON MARS
THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFTAIN THEN EVIDENTLY SIGNIFIED A DESIRE TO SEE ME PERFORM AND MOTIONING ME TO FOLLOW HE STARTED WITH TARS TARKAS FOR THE OPEN PLAZA NOW I HAD MADE NO ATTEMPT TO WALK SINCE MY FIRST SIGNAL FAILURE
TO FORM A HUGE CANOPY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE HALL THERE WAS NO STAIRWAY BUT A GENTLE INCLINE TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING OPENED INTO AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER ENCIRCLED BY GALLERIES ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER
TO LOOK UPON ME WITH LESS FEROCITY BUT AS I WAS TO LEARN LATER THE THING WHICH WEIGHED MOST IN MY FAVOR WAS MY EXHIBITION OF HURDLING WHILE THE MARTIANS ARE IMMENSE THEIR BONES ARE VERY LARGE
MY CAPTOR MERELY STRODE UP TO THE ROSTRUM THE OTHERS MAKING WAY FOR HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE CHIEFTAIN ROSE TO HIS FEET AND UTTERED THE NAME OF MY ESCORT WHO IN TURN HALTED AND REPEATED THE NAME OF THE RULER FOLLOWED BY HIS TITLE
OF INCITANTS TO MERRIMENT THE DEATH AGONIES OF A FELLOW BEING ARE TO THESE STRANGE CREATURES PROVOCATIVE OF THE WILDEST HILARITY WHILE THEIR CHIEF FORM OF COMMONEST AMUSEMENT
STRAIGHT OUT BEHIND WHILE RUNNING A GAPING MOUTH WHICH SPLIT ITS HEAD FROM ITS SNOUT TO ITS LONG MASSIVE NECK LIKE ITS MASTER IT WAS ENTIRELY DEVOID OF HAIR
SMILED AT HIM AND STOOD WAITING HIS WIDE MOUTH SPREAD INTO AN ANSWERING SMILE AND LOCKING ONE OF HIS INTERMEDIARY ARMS IN MINE WE TURNED AND WALKED BACK TOWARD HIS MOUNT
IN SOME INSTANCES CURVING NEARLY TO THEIR HIGH SET EARS THEIR BODIES WERE SMALLER AND LIGHTER IN COLOR AND THEIR FINGERS AND TOES BORE THE RUDIMENTS OF NAILS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY LACKING AMONG THE MALES
WITHOUT A WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION AS WE NEARED THE PLAZA AND MY PRESENCE WAS DISCOVERED WE WERE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF THE CREATURES WHO SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PLUCK ME FROM MY SEAT BEHIND MY GUARD A WORD FROM THE LEADER OF THE PARTY
HAD THEIR MISSIONS BEEN PEACEFUL OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE EXCHANGED SHOTS OR HAVE FOUGHT OUT THEIR INTRODUCTION WITH SOME OTHER OF THEIR VARIOUS WEAPONS MY CAPTOR WHOSE NAME WAS TARS TARKAS
THEY WERE CONVERSING TOGETHER IN LOW TONES AND GESTICULATING AND POINTING TOWARD ME THEIR DISCOVERY THAT I HAD NOT HARMED THE LITTLE MARTIANS AND THAT I WAS UNARMED MUST HAVE CAUSED THEM
WHICH LEADS NO LIVING MARTIAN KNOWS WHITHER AND FROM WHOSE BOSOM NO MARTIAN HAS EVER RETURNED OR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE DID HE RETURN AFTER ONCE EMBARKING UPON ITS COLD DARK WATERS
OF THE LITTLE DEVILS I HAD BEEN WATCHING BUT HOW PUNY AND HARMLESS THEY NOW LOOKED BESIDE THIS HUGE AND TERRIFIC INCARNATION OF HATE OF VENGEANCE AND OF DEATH
NEITHER DID I I FOUND MYSELF LYING PRONE UPON A BED OF YELLOWISH MOSSLIKE VEGETATION WHICH STRETCHED AROUND ME IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR INTERMINABLE MILES I SEEMED TO BE LYING IN A DEEP
ON SUCH A LITTLE THING MY LIFE HUNG THAT I OFTEN MARVEL THAT I ESCAPED SO EASILY HAD NOT THE RIFLE OF THE LEADER OF THE PARTY SWUNG FROM ITS FASTENINGS BESIDE HIS SADDLE IN SUCH A WAY
THE ADULT FEMALES RANGED IN HEIGHT FROM TEN TO TWELVE FEET THE CHILDREN WERE LIGHT IN COLOR EVEN LIGHTER THAN THE WOMEN AND ALL LOOKED PRECISELY ALIKE TO ME EXCEPT THAT SOME WERE TALLER
IN AVIATION AND IN WAR BUT PERHAPS BY FAR THE GREATEST DEATH LOSS COMES DURING THE AGE OF CHILDHOOD WHEN VAST NUMBERS OF THE LITTLE MARTIANS FALL VICTIMS TO THE GREAT WHITE APES OF MARS
BUT I WAS NOT LONG IN BEING ENLIGHTENED THEY FIRST REPEATED THE WORD SAK A NUMBER OF TIMES AND THEN TARS TARKAS MADE SEVERAL JUMPS REPEATING THE SAME WORD BEFORE EACH LEAP THEN TURNING TO ME HE SAID SAK
WHEN EQUIPPED WITH THEIR WIRELESS FINDERS AND SIGHTERS IS BUT A TRIFLE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILES THIS IS QUITE FAR ENOUGH TO IMBUE ME WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MARTIAN FIREARM
IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS FRONTING ON THE PLAZA AND WHICH FROM THE LITTER OF SILKS AND FURS UPON THE FLOOR I TOOK TO BE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS OF SEVERAL OF THE NATIVES THE ROOM WAS WELL LIGHTED BY A NUMBER OF LARGE WINDOWS
AND WAS BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED WITH MURAL PAINTINGS AND MOSAICS
EVIDENTLY HE FEARED THAT WERE I TO BE REALLY FRIGHTENED AGAIN I MIGHT JUMP ENTIRELY OUT OF THE LANDSCAPE HE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS WITH HIS MEN MOTIONED TO ME THAT I WOULD RIDE BEHIND ONE OF THEM AND THEN MOUNTED HIS OWN ANIMAL
I CONCLUDED TO HAZARD A LITTLE CONVERSATION ON MY OWN PART AS I HAD GUESSED THAT HE WAS MAKING OVERTURES OF PEACE THE THROWING DOWN OF HIS WEAPONS AND THE WITHDRAWING OF HIS TROOP BEFORE HIS ADVANCE TOWARD ME
AS NO TWO OF US ARE IDENTICAL ALTHOUGH WE ARE ALL CAST IN A SIMILAR MOLD THIS PICTURE OR RATHER MATERIALIZED NIGHTMARE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AT LENGTH
FROM MY PURSUERS AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE I ALIGHTED UPON THE SOFT MOSS EASILY AND WITHOUT MISHAP AND TURNING SAW MY ENEMIES LINED UP ALONG THE FURTHER WALL
FOR SUCH I NOW CONSIDERED THEM DESPITE THE SUAVE MANNER IN WHICH I HAD BEEN TRAPPED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THEIR ORNAMENTS ALL WERE NAKED THE WOMEN VARIED IN APPEARANCE BUT LITTLE FROM THE MEN EXCEPT THAT THEIR TUSKS WERE MUCH LARGER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR HEIGHT
FOR THE EFFORT WHICH ON EARTH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME STANDING UPRIGHT CARRIED ME INTO THE MARTIAN AIR TO THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT THREE YARDS I ALIGHTED SOFTLY UPON THE GROUND HOWEVER WITHOUT APPRECIABLE SHOCK OR JAR
WHEN HE WAS WITHIN ABOUT FIFTY FEET OF ME HE UNCLASPED AN ENORMOUS METAL ARMLET AND HOLDING IT TOWARD ME IN THE OPEN PALM OF HIS HAND ADDRESSED ME IN A CLEAR RESONANT VOICE
AND WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED THE CHIEFTAIN ADDRESSED ME AT SOME LENGTH I REPLIED IN OUR GOOD OLD ENGLISH TONGUE MERELY TO CONVINCE HIM THAT NEITHER OF US COULD UNDERSTAND THE OTHER
WAS FULLY FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT
AT THE TIME THIS CEREMONY AND THE WORDS THEY UTTERED MEANT NOTHING TO ME BUT LATER I CAME TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS THE CUSTOMARY GREETING BETWEEN GREEN MARTIANS HAD THE MEN BEEN STRANGERS AND THEREFORE UNABLE TO EXCHANGE NAMES
WHEREAS THE GREAT BULKS OF THE MARTIANS
THESE LATTER ADD A MOST FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE TO AN OTHERWISE FEARSOME AND TERRIBLE COUNTENANCE AS THE LOWER TUSKS CURVE UPWARD TO SHARP POINTS WHICH END ABOUT WHERE THE EYES OF EARTHLY HUMAN BEINGS ARE LOCATED
TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE CITY WAS A LARGE PLAZA AND UPON THIS AND IN THE BUILDINGS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING IT WERE CAMPED SOME NINE OR TEN HUNDRED CREATURES OF THE SAME BREED AS MY CAPTORS
WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR THE WEIGHT OF THESE RIFLES IS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE AND WITH THE SMALL CALIBER EXPLOSIVE RADIUM PROJECTILES WHICH THEY USE AND THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE BARREL
SO WHY NOT THEN ON MARS PLACING MY HAND OVER MY HEART I BOWED LOW TO THE MARTIAN AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHILE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE
AND CAME AROUND THE END OF THE INCUBATOR TOWARD ME ENTIRELY UNARMED AND AS NAKED AS I EXCEPT FOR THE ORNAMENTS STRAPPED UPON HIS HEAD LIMBS AND BREAST
NOW COMMENCED A SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS WHICH EVEN THEN SEEMED LUDICROUS IN THE EXTREME I FOUND THAT I MUST LEARN TO WALK ALL OVER AGAIN
I WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER TO EXPLORE THE LOW STRUCTURE WHICH WAS THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF HABITATION IN SIGHT
AND I DID THE ONLY THING A GENTLEMAN MIGHT DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BRUTALITY BOORISHNESS AND LACK OF CONSIDERATION FOR A STRANGER'S RIGHTS I SWUNG MY FIST SQUARELY TO HIS JAW AND HE WENT DOWN LIKE A FELLED OX
AND SO NOW I WENT SKIPPING AND FLITTING ABOUT AMONG THE DESKS AND CHAIRS LIKE SOME MONSTROUS GRASSHOPPER AFTER BRUISING MYSELF SEVERELY
ABOUT FOUR FEET IN HEIGHT NO WATER AND NO OTHER VEGETATION THAN THE MOSS WAS IN EVIDENCE AND AS I WAS SOMEWHAT THIRSTY I DETERMINED TO DO A LITTLE EXPLORING SPRINGING TO MY FEET I RECEIVED MY FIRST MARTIAN SURPRISE
BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THE ACTION WITH WHICH I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED MY WORDS STRETCHING MY HAND TOWARD HIM I ADVANCED AND TOOK THE ARMLET FROM HIS OPEN PALM CLASPING IT ABOUT MY ARM ABOVE THE ELBOW
HE THEN STOPPED AS THOUGH WAITING FOR MY REPLY PRICKING UP HIS ANTENNAE LIKE EARS AND COCKING HIS STRANGE LOOKING EYES STILL FURTHER TOWARD ME AS THE SILENCE BECAME PAINFUL
THEIR NOSES WERE BUT LONGITUDINAL SLITS IN THE CENTER OF THEIR FACES MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS THERE WAS NO HAIR ON THEIR BODIES
MY FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS HOWEVER AS THE OTHER MARTIANS AT FIRST STRUCK DUMB WITH WONDERMENT FINALLY BROKE INTO WILD PEALS OF LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE APPLAUSE AS SUCH BUT LATER
WHICH FACT HAD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE NOISELESSNESS OF THEIR APPROACH AND IN COMMON WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF LEGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE FAUNA OF MARS THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN
NOR WAS THERE ROOM BENEATH THE DESKS FOR THEIR LONG LEGS EVIDENTLY THEN THERE WERE OTHER DENIZENS ON MARS THAN THE WILD AND GROTESQUE CREATURES INTO WHOSE HANDS I HAD FALLEN BUT THE EVIDENCES OF EXTREME ANTIQUITY
AND THE GROTESQUE CARICATURES WHICH SAT BLINKING IN THE SUNLIGHT WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE ME TO DOUBT MY SANITY THEY SEEMED MOSTLY HEAD WITH LITTLE SCRAWNY BODIES LONG NECKS AND SIX LEGS OR
LIKE AN OBEDIENT PUPPY THE THING WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHETLAND PONY
WHICH THE CHIEFTAIN THEN ORDERED ME TO MAKE BUT I WAS BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND DETERMINED ON THE SPOT THAT MY ONLY METHOD OF SALVATION WAS TO DEMAND THE CONSIDERATION FROM THESE CREATURES
HIS TWO LEFT ARMS WERE OUTSTRETCHED LATERALLY TO HELP PRESERVE HIS BALANCE THE THING HE RODE HAVING NEITHER BRIDLE OR REINS OF ANY DESCRIPTION FOR GUIDANCE AND HIS MOUNT
I GRASPED HER PROFFERED ARM AND TOGETHER WE CROSSED THE PLAZA TOWARD A LARGE BUILDING ON THE FAR SIDE MY FAIR COMPANION WAS ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL HAVING JUST ARRIVED AT MATURITY BUT NOT YET TO HER FULL HEIGHT
CHAPTER THREE MY ADVENT ON MARS I OPENED MY EYES UPON A STRANGE AND WEIRD LANDSCAPE I KNEW THAT I WAS ON MARS NOT ONCE DID I QUESTION EITHER MY SANITY OR MY WAKEFULNESS
AND AT A SIGN FROM THE LEADER I HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE GROUND AGAIN LOCKING HIS ARM IN MINE WE HAD PROCEEDED INTO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THERE WERE FEW FORMALITIES OBSERVED IN APPROACHING THE MARTIAN CHIEFTAIN
AND ONE OTHER ANIMAL THE ONLY MAMMAL EXISTING ON MARS ALONE HAVE WELL FORMED NAILS AND THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO HOOFED ANIMALS IN EXISTENCE THERE BEHIND THIS FIRST CHARGING DEMON
AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED TWO LEGS AND TWO ARMS WITH AN INTERMEDIARY PAIR OF LIMBS WHICH COULD BE USED AT WILL EITHER AS ARMS OR LEGS THEIR EYES WERE SET AT THE EXTREME SIDES OF THEIR HEADS A TRIFLE ABOVE THE CENTER
AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UPON EARTH AND FROM DESIRING TO ANNIHILATE ME THEY SUDDENLY LOOKED UPON ME AS A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY TO BE CAPTURED AND EXHIBITED AMONG THEIR FELLOWS THE RESPITE
BUT I NOTICED THAT WHEN I SMILED SLIGHTLY ON CONCLUDING HE DID LIKEWISE THIS FACT AND THE SIMILAR OCCURRENCE DURING MY FIRST TALK WITH TARS TARKAS CONVINCED ME THAT WE HAD AT LEAST SOMETHING IN COMMON THE ABILITY TO SMILE
ONLY ABOUT ONE MARTIAN IN A THOUSAND DIES OF SICKNESS OR DISEASE AND POSSIBLY ABOUT TWENTY TAKE THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE THE OTHER NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DIE VIOLENT DEATHS IN DUELS IN HUNTING
SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
THEY ALL WENT IN OR ALL EXCEPT MISTER SMITH YOU SEE MISTER SMITH HAD COME DOWN FROM THERE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ROCKS AND MINING AND CANOES AND THE NORTH COUNTRY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO EAT FLOUR BAKED DAMPERS UNDER THE LEE SIDE OF A CANOE PROPPED AMONG THE UNDERBRUSH
IT WAS PROBABLY IN HIM FROM THE START THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH THINGS AS TRACTION STOCK AND AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS WENT TO HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF MISTER CARNEGIE AND MISTER ROCKEFELLER THE YEARNING TONE OF HIS VOICE MADE IT AS SOFT AS LATHERED SOAP
I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS GETTING SO MUCH MONEY WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY IT ACTS ON PEOPLE IN THE LARGER CITIES IT SEEMED TO SPOIL ONE'S IDEA OF JEFF THAT COPPER AND ASBESTOS AND BANANA LANDS SHOULD FORM THE GOAL OF HIS THOUGHT WHEN IF HE KNEW IT
JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH PUT THE REST OF HIS WIFE'S MONEY INTO TEMISKAMING COMMON AND LAWYER MACARTNEY GOT THE FEVER TOO AND PUT EVERY CENT THAT HIS SISTER POSSESSED INTO TULIP PREFERRED AND EVEN WHEN YOUNG FIZZLECHIP SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE MARIPOSA HOUSE MISTER GINGHAM BURIED HIM IN A CASKET WITH SILVER HANDLES
AND THEN IN THE OTHER YOU SEE IN MARIPOSA SHAVING ISN'T THE HURRIED PERFUNCTORY THING THAT IT IS IN THE CITY A SHAVE IS LOOKED UPON AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND LASTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE MORNING HOURS PERHAPS THERE WAS A SEMBLANCE OF HASTE ABOUT IT
THEY GIVE IT AWAY AND WHO DO THEY GIVE IT TO WHY TO THOSE AS DON'T WANT IT EVERY TIME THEY GIVE IT TO THESE PROFESSORS AND TO THIS RESEARCH AND THAT AND DO THE POOR GET ANY OF IT NOT A CENT AND NEVER WILL I TELL YOU BOYS CONTINUED JEFF
AND IN LESS THAN NO TIME THERE WASN'T STANDING ROOM IN THE BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN SMITH'S HOTEL THEY HAD THREE EXTRA BARKEEPERS WORKING ON THE LAGER BEER PUMPS
THE FAULT LIES RATHER WITH AN ART THAT IS DEFICIENT THAN IN AN AFFECTION THAT IS WANTING
AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
AND THE OTHER NONSENSE NOVELS EACH OF THESE IS PUBLISHED BY JOHN LANE LONDON AND NEW YORK AND EITHER OF THEM CAN BE OBTAINED ABSURD THOUGH IT SOUNDS FOR THE MERE SUM OF THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE ANY READER OF THIS PREFACE FOR EXAMPLE RIDICULOUS THOUGH IT APPEARS
JEFF LAID DOWN WHAT HE WAS READING AND STARTED TO TALK ABOUT CARNEGIE THIS CARNEGIE I BET YOU WOULD BE WORTH SAID JEFF CLOSING UP HIS EYES IN CALCULATION AS MUCH AS PERHAPS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WAS TO SELL HIM UP
I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
HE WOULD SAY AND ANOTHER DAY HE WOULD PAUSE IN THE COURSE OF SHAVING AND ALMOST WHISPER DID YOU EVER SEE THIS ROCKEFELLER IT WAS ONLY BY A SORT OF ACCIDENT THAT I CAME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO JEFFERSON'S SPECULATION THAT NO ONE IN MARIPOSA EVER KNEW OR WILL EVER KNOW NOW
AN EXPERIENCE WHICH HAS LEFT ME WITH A PROFOUND SYMPATHY FOR THE MANY GIFTED AND BRILLIANT MEN WHO ARE COMPELLED TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN THE MOST DREARY THE MOST THANKLESS AND THE WORST PAID PROFESSION IN THE WORLD
IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
LOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITE
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
AND RIGHT AT OUR VERY DOORS YOU COULD SEE AS I SAW THE NIGHT EXPRESS GOING NORTH EVERY EVENING FOR ALL ONE KNEW ROCKEFELLER OR CARNEGIE OR ANYONE MIGHT BE ON IT
TO AN ONLOOKER IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM SO SIMPLE I NEVER KNEW THE MEANNESS THE TRICKERY OF THE MINING BUSINESS THE SHEER OBSTINATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIGGER CAPITALISTS NOT TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY MIGHT TILL I HEARD THE ACCOUNTS OF JEFF'S DIFFERENT MINES TAKE THE CASE OF CORONA JEWEL
AND BESIDE IT JEFF WOULD SIT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON AND THE PAPER SPREAD OUT READING ABOUT CARNEGIE AND ROCKEFELLER NEAR HIM BUT AWAY FROM THE TABLE WAS THE WOMAN DOING NEEDLEWORK AND MYRA WHEN SHE WASN'T WORKING IN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS THERE TOO WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE READING MARIE CORELLI
A LAND OF HOPE AND SUNSHINE WHERE LITTLE TOWNS SPREAD THEIR SQUARE STREETS AND THEIR TRIM MAPLE TREES BESIDE PLACID LAKES ALMOST WITHIN ECHO OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST IS LARGE ENOUGH
TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSH
AND WHEN SHE ACTED PORTIA IN THE TRIAL SCENE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONCERT
WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
THERE WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN THAT JEFF WOULD SIZE UP SIDEWAYS AS HE STROPPED THE RAZOR AND IN WHOSE EAR HE WOULD WHISPER I SEE WHERE SAINT LOUIS HAS TOOK FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES OFF CHICAGO AND SO HOLD HIM FASCINATED TO THE END IN THE SAME WAY HE WOULD SAY TO MISTER SMITH
AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
I MAY SAY IN PARENTHESES THAT IT WAS A FAVOURITE METHOD IN MARIPOSA IF YOU WANTED TO GET AT THE REAL WORTH OF A MAN TO IMAGINE HIM CLEAN SOLD UP PUT UP FOR AUCTION AS IT WERE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO TEST HIM AND NOW LOOK AT EM JEFF WENT ON
THEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCE
AND THAT SPREAD ROUND HIM A KIND OF HALO OF WEALTH AND MYSTERY AND OUTLANDISHNESS OH SOMETHING SPANISH PERHAPS YOU'VE FELT IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANYHOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND YELLOW FEVER AND WHAT THE NEGROES WERE LIKE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
AND THAT TOUCHES YOU NO THEY ASKED NO GUARANTEE JUST SEND THE MONEY WHETHER BY EXPRESS ORDER OR BY BANK DRAFT OR CHEQUE THEY LEFT THAT ENTIRELY TO ONESELF AS A MATTER BETWEEN CUBAN GENTLEMEN AND THEY WERE QUITE FRANK ABOUT THEIR ENTERPRISE
NOR TO CONSTRUCT EVEN THE SMALLEST SECTION OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY THIS HOWEVER IS A FORM OF NATIONAL INGRATITUDE TO WHICH ONE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED IN THIS DOMINION APART FROM MY COLLEGE WORK I HAVE WRITTEN TWO BOOKS ONE CALLED LITERARY LAPSES
AND THEN AND THEN WELL THAT'S JUST THE QUEER THING ABOUT THE MINING BUSINESS WHY SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IT SEEMED THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRE TO THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET THAT THEY HAD STRUCK A VEIN OF SILVER IN THE NORTHERN STAR AS THICK AS A SIDEWALK
ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY TO BE A NECESSARY AND UNIVERSAL ADJUNCT OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS THE INSPIRATION OF THE BOOK
THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
MY PARENTS MIGRATED TO CANADA IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I DECIDED TO GO WITH THEM MY FATHER TOOK UP A FARM NEAR LAKE SIMCOE IN ONTARIO THIS WAS DURING THE HARD TIMES OF CANADIAN FARMING
AN ABILITY TO THINK AND WHAT IS STILL BETTER TO STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER FOR MONTHS AT A TIME I HAVE WRITTEN A NUMBER OF THINGS IN CONNECTION WITH MY COLLEGE LIFE A BOOK ON POLITICAL SCIENCE AND MANY ESSAYS MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND SO ON
ELSE HOW WAS IT THAT HENRY MULLINS MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SELLING A DRAFT FOR FORTY THOUSAND ON NEW YORK AND WHY WAS IT THAT MISTER SMITH WOULDN'T PAY BILLY THE DESK CLERK HIS BACK WAGES WHEN HE WANTED TO PUT IT INTO CUBA OH YES SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE SEEN IT
THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET HER AND SHE SAYS NOW THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING SHE HATES IT'S THE STAGE AND SHE CAN'T SEE HOW THE ACTRESSES PUT UP WITH IT ANYWAY THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD
BLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAID
BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
THEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCE
IN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT
AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
AND BY MEANS OF THIS AND SOME TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT BY MC GILL UNIVERSITY I SURVIVED UNTIL I TOOK THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN NINETEEN O THREE THE MEANING OF THIS DEGREE IS THAT THE RECIPIENT OF INSTRUCTION IS EXAMINED FOR THE LAST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND IS PRONOUNCED COMPLETELY FULL
AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
WHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
I LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAY
I AM ABLE TO REGARD MYSELF AS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE THE EMOLUMENT IS SO HIGH AS TO PLACE ME DISTINCTLY ABOVE THE POLICEMEN POSTMEN STREET CAR CONDUCTORS AND OTHER SALARIED OFFICIALS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
THEY SAID COMMONLY IN MARIPOSA THAT JEFF MADE MONEY OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP HE MAY HAVE AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THAT TURNED HIS MIND TO INVESTMENT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD A SHAVE COST FIVE CENTS AND A HAIR CUT FIFTEEN OR THE TWO IF YOU LIKED FOR A QUARTER
WITHIN A FORTNIGHT THEY PUT A PARTITION DOWN ROBERTSON'S COAL AND WOOD OFFICE AND OPENED THE MARIPOSA MINING EXCHANGE AND JUST ABOUT EVERY MAN ON THE MAIN STREET STARTED BUYING SCRIP THEN PRESENTLY YOUNG FIZZLECHIP WHO HAD BEEN TELLER IN MULLINS'S BANK AND THAT EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT A WORTHLESS JACKASS BEFORE
AFTER THIS NO NEW IDEAS CAN BE IMPARTED TO HIM FROM THIS TIME AND SINCE MY MARRIAGE WHICH HAD OCCURRED AT THIS PERIOD I HAVE BELONGED TO THE STAFF OF MC GILL UNIVERSITY FIRST AS LECTURER IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LATER AS HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
COULD WALK INTO A BOOKSTORE AND BUY BOTH OF THESE BOOKS FOR SEVEN SHILLINGS YET THESE WORKS ARE OF SO HUMOROUS A CHARACTER THAT FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO PRINT THEM THE COMPOSITORS FELL BACK FROM THEIR TASK SUFFOCATED WITH LAUGHTER AND GASPING FOR AIR
I KNOW NO WAY IN WHICH A WRITER MAY MORE FITTINGLY INTRODUCE HIS WORK TO THE PUBLIC THAN BY GIVING A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHO AND WHAT HE IS BY THIS MEANS SOME OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE IS VERY PROPERLY SHIFTED TO THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS LIFE
YOU REMEMBER THE CUBAN LAND FRAUDS IN NEW YORK AND PORFORIO GOMEZ SHOOTING THE DETECTIVE AND HIM AND MAXIMO MOREZ GETTING CLEAR AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHY EVEN IN THE CITY PAPERS IT ONLY FILLED AN INCH OR TWO OF TYPE AND ANYWAY THE NAMES WERE HARD TO REMEMBER
YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
SO OF COURSE AS SOON AS JEFF MADE THE FORTUNE MYRA HAD HER RESIGNATION IN NEXT MORNING
I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
EXACTLY THE KIND OF A HEAD A MAN NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE A HAUL OR A CLEAN UP IT WAS EVIDENTLY SIMPLY A MATTER OF THE HEAD AND AS FAR AS ONE COULD JUDGE JEFF'S OWN WAS THE VERY TYPE REQUIRED I DON'T KNOW JUST AT WHAT TIME OR HOW JEFFERSON FIRST BEGAN HIS SPECULATIVE ENTERPRISES
WITH ONE HAND ON HIS KNEE AND A DOG ONE OF THOSE REGULAR MINING DOGS AT HIS FEET AND A LOOK OF PIERCING INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FACE THAT WOULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I SAY THAT THE RECOGNITION MEANT A LOT TO JEFF FOR ITS OWN SAKE
BUT TO WRITE SOMETHING OUT OF ONE'S OWN MIND WORTH READING FOR ITS OWN SAKE IS AN ARDUOUS CONTRIVANCE ONLY TO BE ACHIEVED IN FORTUNATE MOMENTS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
TO MAKE HIM I CLAPPED THE GAITERS OF ONE ECCLESIASTIC ROUND THE LEGS OF ANOTHER ADDED THE SERMONS OF A THIRD AND THE CHARACTER OF A FOURTH AND SO LET HIM START ON HIS WAY IN THE BOOK TO PICK UP SUCH INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES AS HE MIGHT FIND FOR HIMSELF
FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
BUT IF A FELLER KNOWS THE COUNTRY AND KEEPS HIS HEAD LEVEL HE CAN'T LOSE JEFFERSON HAD LOOKED AT SO MANY PROSPECTUSES AND SO MANY PICTURES OF MINES AND PINE TREES AND SMELTERS THAT I THINK HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT HE'D NEVER BEEN IN THE COUNTRY ANYWAY WHAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILES
THAT WAS JEFF'S MONEY PART OF IT MULLINS GOT THE TELEGRAM FROM A BROKER OR SOMEONE AND HE SHOWED IT TO JEFF JUST AS HE WAS GOING UP THE STREET WITH AN ESTATE AGENT TO LOOK AT A BIG EMPTY LOT ON THE HILL BEHIND THE TOWN THE VERY PLACE FOR THESE INCURABLES
A FEW DAYS LATER HE GOT A LETTER FROM THE CUBAN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK ACCEPTING THE MONEY STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT A SINGLE QUESTION AND WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING MORE OF JOHNSON EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF JEFF'S THEY WROTE MOST HANDSOMELY ANY FRIENDS OF JEFF'S WERE FRIENDS OF CUBA
THE RAZOR WOULD GO SLOWER AND SLOWER AND PAUSE AND STOP MOVE AND PAUSE AGAIN TILL THE SHAVE DIED AWAY INTO THE MERE DROWSE OF CONVERSATION AT SUCH HOURS THE MARIPOSA BARBER SHOP WOULD BECOME A VERY PALACE OF SLUMBER
ALL MONEY THEY MIGHT SEND WOULD BE TREATED JUST AS JEFF'S WOULD BE TREATED ONE REASON PERHAPS WHY JEFF DIDN'T GIVE UP SHAVING WAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO TALK ABOUT CUBA
THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
IN OTHER WORDS I WAS WHAT IS CALLED A DISTINGUISHED GRADUATE AND AS SUCH I TOOK TO SCHOOL TEACHING AS THE ONLY TRADE I COULD FIND THAT NEED NEITHER EXPERIENCE NOR INTELLECT I SPENT MY TIME FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE TO EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE ON THE STAFF OF UPPER CANADA COLLEGE
A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT ALL ROUND THE BRITISH EMPIRE DELIVERING ADDRESSES ON IMPERIAL ORGANIZATION WHEN I STATE THAT THESE LECTURES WERE FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA THE BANANA RIOTS IN TRINIDAD AND THE TURCO ITALIAN WAR
I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
AND BECOME A LEADING ACTRESS BUT AS I SAID THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION COUNTED A LOT FOR JEFF THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO GET THAT SORT OF THING IT COMES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH BRAINS YOU KNOW ARE RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS WHY OF COURSE WITHIN A WEEK FROM THIS
JEFF RECEIVED THE FIRST BIG PACKET OF STUFF FROM THE CUBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WITH COLOURED PICTURES OF CUBA AND FIELDS OF BANANAS AND HACIENDAS AND INSURRECTOS WITH MACHETES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY HEARD OF HIM SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FOR A MODEST MAN LIKE JEFFERSON TO SAY HOW
IN REGARD TO THE PRESENT WORK I MUST DISCLAIM AT ONCE ALL INTENTIONS OF TRYING TO DO ANYTHING SO RIDICULOUSLY EASY AS WRITING ABOUT A REAL PLACE AND REAL PEOPLE MARIPOSA IS NOT A REAL TOWN ON THE CONTRARY IT IS ABOUT SEVENTY OR EIGHTY OF THEM
MANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WRITE THESE HUMOROUS NOTHINGS IN IDLE MOMENTS WHEN THE WEARIED BRAIN IS UNABLE TO PERFORM THE SERIOUS LABOURS OF THE ECONOMIST MY OWN EXPERIENCE IS EXACTLY THE OTHER WAY
WHILE I AM ABLE TO MIX WITH THE POORER OF THE BUSINESS MEN OF THE CITY ON TERMS OF SOMETHING LIKE EQUALITY IN POINT OF LEISURE I ENJOY MORE IN THE FOUR CORNERS OF A SINGLE YEAR THAN A BUSINESS MAN KNOWS IN HIS WHOLE LIFE I THUS HAVE WHAT THE BUSINESS MAN CAN NEVER ENJOY
AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
THAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
AND PEOPLE WERE JUST CLUTCHING FOR THEM THEN AT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG OYSTER SUPPER IN SMITH'S CAFF WITH SPEECHES AND THE MARIPOSA BAND OUTSIDE AND THE QUEER THING WAS THAT THE VERY NEXT AFTERNOON WAS THE FUNERAL OF YOUNG FIZZLECHIP
WITH A FALSE FRONT THAT STICKS UP ABOVE ITS REAL HEIGHT AND GIVES IT AN AIR AT ONCE RECTANGULAR AND IMPOSING IT IS A FORM OF ARCHITECTURE MUCH USED IN MARIPOSA AND UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRETENTIOUS AND ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF MODERN BUSINESS
SO ALWAYS AFTER THAT I KNEW JUST WHAT THOSE BANANAS WERE BEING GROWN FOR INDEED AFTER THAT THOUGH JEFFERSON NEVER SPOKE OF HIS INTENTIONS DIRECTLY HE SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO BEAR ON THEM
HE ASKED ME FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HOW MANY BLIND PEOPLE IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL ONE OF THESE BLIND HOMES AND HOW A FELLER COULD GET AHOLD OF THEM
I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
IF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACY
A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
THERE WERE NO BOYS PRESENT BUT IN MARIPOSA ALL REALLY IMPORTANT SPEECHES ARE ADDRESSED TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE OF BOYS I TELL YOU IF I WAS TO MAKE A MILLION OUT OF THIS CUBEY I'D GIVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE POOR YES SIR DIVIDE IT UP INTO A HUNDRED LOTS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HADN'T NOTHING
AND JEFF WENT BACK TO THE SHOP SO QUIET HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL THAT IS STRICKEN THROUGH HOW QUIET IT SEEMS TO MOVE
AND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ON
A FELLER COULD GET ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A SHOWING
AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR IT SETS IN VIOLENT AGITATION A COILED SPRING UP ABOVE AND A BELL THAT ALMOST RINGS INSIDE THERE ARE TWO SHAVING CHAIRS OF THE HEAVIER OR ELECTROCUTION PATTERN
YOU MAY FIND THEM ALL THE WAY FROM LAKE SUPERIOR TO THE SEA WITH THE SAME SQUARE STREETS AND THE SAME MAPLE TREES AND THE SAME CHURCHES AND HOTELS AND EVERYWHERE THE SUNSHINE OF THE LAND OF HOPE SIMILARLY THE REVEREND MISTER DRONE IS NOT ONE PERSON BUT ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN
UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
THAT IS INDUCED BY HONEST MANUAL TOIL I WAS EDUCATED AT UPPER CANADA COLLEGE TORONTO OF WHICH I WAS HEAD BOY IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FROM THERE I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO WHERE I GRADUATED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE
CAME BACK FROM THE COBALT COUNTRY WITH A FORTUNE AND LOAFED ROUND IN THE MARIPOSA HOUSE IN ENGLISH KHAKI AND A HORIZONTAL HAT DRUNK ALL THE TIME
AND MY FATHER WAS JUST ABLE BY GREAT DILIGENCE TO PAY THE HIRED MEN AND IN YEARS OF PLENTY TO RAISE ENOUGH GRAIN TO HAVE SEED FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S CROP WITHOUT BUYING ANY BY THIS PROCESS MY BROTHERS AND I WERE INEVITABLY DRIVEN OFF THE LAND
EVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEED
JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
THE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSED
YOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATION
I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
THERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HER
THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH
AS GRAVE AS AN OPERATING SURGEON THEN AS I THINK I SAID MISTER SMITH CAME IN EVERY MORNING AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF FLORIDA WATER AND RUMS ESSENCES AND REVIVERS AND RENOVATORS REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE
AT THE UNIVERSITY I SPENT MY ENTIRE TIME IN THE ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGES LIVING DEAD AND HALF DEAD AND KNEW NOTHING OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN THIS DILIGENT PURSUIT OF WORDS I SPENT ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS OF EACH DAY
MULLINS AND BAGSHAW AND JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH AND THE REST ARE IT IS TRUE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE BUT I HAVE KNOWN THEM IN SUCH A VARIETY OF FORMS WITH SUCH ALTERNATIONS OF TALL AND SHORT DARK AND FAIR THAT INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD HAVE MUCH ADO TO KNOW THEM
I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOO
ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
AND NEEDS A TELLER AS FOR MISTER SMITH WITH HIS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY POUNDS HIS HOARSE VOICE HIS LOUD CHECK SUIT
THEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT
AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
BUT I HAD NOT EXPECTED SUCH CONTEMPT SIMONOV WAS POSITIVELY SURPRISED AT MY TURNING UP
WHO HAD BEEN ALL DAY EXPECTING HIS MONTH'S WAGES BUT IN HIS FOOLISHNESS WAS UNWILLING TO BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK ABOUT IT I SLIPPED BETWEEN HIM AND THE DOOR AND JUMPING INTO A HIGH CLASS SLEDGE ON WHICH I SPENT MY LAST HALF ROUBLE
AND SHOWED ITSELF IN A CERTAIN RAKISHNESS I HATED THEM HORRIBLY THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM THEY REPAID ME IN THE SAME WAY AND DID NOT CONCEAL THEIR AVERSION FOR ME BUT BY THEN I DID NOT DESIRE THEIR AFFECTION
LISTENING TO THEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY TO THEM OR VENTURING TO SAY A WORD I BECAME STUPEFIED SEVERAL TIMES I FELT MYSELF PERSPIRING I WAS OVERCOME BY A SORT OF PARALYSIS BUT THIS WAS PLEASANT AND GOOD FOR ME
ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
BUT IT'S A PRIVATE THING BETWEEN US FRIENDS FERFITCHKIN SAID CROSSLY AS HE TOO PICKED UP HIS HAT IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL GATHERING WE DO NOT WANT AT ALL PERHAPS THEY WENT AWAY FERFITCHKIN DID NOT GREET ME IN ANY WAY AS HE WENT OUT
OF DOMINATING THEM CARRYING THEM AWAY MAKING THEM LIKE ME IF ONLY FOR MY ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND UNMISTAKABLE WIT THEY WOULD ABANDON ZVERKOV HE WOULD SIT ON ONE SIDE SILENT AND ASHAMED WHILE I SHOULD CRUSH HIM THEN PERHAPS
PUT A COLLAR OF GERMAN BEAVER ON HIS GREAT COAT I SUDDENLY BECAME A HERO I WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED MY SIX FOOT LIEUTENANT EVEN IF HE HAD CALLED ON ME
I HAD NO MONEY ALL I HAD WAS NINE ROUBLES I HAD TO GIVE SEVEN OF THAT TO MY SERVANT APOLLON FOR HIS MONTHLY WAGES THAT WAS ALL I PAID HIM HE HAD TO KEEP HIMSELF
BUT WERE MORALLY IMPRESSED ESPECIALLY AS THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO NOTICE ME ON THOSE GROUNDS THE MOCKERY CEASED BUT THE HOSTILITY REMAINED AND COLD AND STRAINED RELATIONS BECAME PERMANENT BETWEEN US IN THE END I COULD NOT PUT UP WITH IT
EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
I WENT TO THE OFFICE HOWEVER AS USUAL BUT SNEAKED AWAY HOME TWO HOURS EARLIER TO GET READY THE GREAT THING I THOUGHT IS NOT TO BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE OR THEY WILL THINK I AM OVERJOYED AT COMING BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SUCH
LAKE COMO BEING FOR THAT PURPOSE TRANSFERRED TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ROME THEN WOULD COME A SCENE IN THE BUSHES AND SO ON AND SO ON AS THOUGH YOU DID NOT KNOW ALL ABOUT IT YOU WILL SAY THAT IT IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE TO DRAG ALL THIS INTO PUBLIC
OPENED THE MOVABLE PANE AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE TROUBLED DARKNESS OF THE THICKLY FALLING WET SNOW AT LAST MY WRETCHED LITTLE CLOCK HISSED OUT FIVE I SEIZED MY HAT AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT APOLLON
LIKE SOME INSOLENT FLUNKEY BOASTING OF HIS MASTER THE GENERAL'S DECORATIONS CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ZVERKOV WILL LET US PAY ALONE HE WILL ACCEPT FROM DELICACY
I HATED THE ABRUPT SELF CONFIDENT TONE OF HIS VOICE HIS ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN WITTICISMS
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE ATTACKS OF THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL VISITED ME EVEN DURING THE PERIOD OF DISSIPATION AND JUST AT THE TIMES WHEN I WAS TOUCHING THE BOTTOM THEY CAME IN SEPARATE SPURTS AS THOUGH REMINDING ME OF THEMSELVES
TO SUBDUE TO ATTRACT THEM
IN SPITE OF SUPERFICIAL FANTASTIC AND SHAM NOTIONS OF HONOUR AND DIGNITY ALL BUT VERY FEW OF US POSITIVELY GROVELLED BEFORE ZVERKOV AND THE MORE SO THE MORE HE SWAGGERED AND IT WAS NOT FROM ANY INTERESTED MOTIVE
BUT I HAD ALREADY CLUTCHED AT THE IDEA AND WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO FORM AN OPINION UPON THAT I RETORTED IN A SHAKING VOICE AS THOUGH SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT IS JUST MY REASON FOR WISHING IT NOW
IN THOSE FLIGHTS INTO THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT WAS FANTASTIC LOVE THOUGH IT WAS NEVER APPLIED TO ANYTHING HUMAN IN REALITY YET THERE WAS SO MUCH OF THIS LOVE THAT ONE DID NOT FEEL AFTERWARDS EVEN THE IMPULSE TO APPLY IT IN REALITY
ON RETURNING HOME I DEFERRED FOR A TIME MY DESIRE TO EMBRACE ALL MANKIND I HAD HOWEVER ONE OTHER ACQUAINTANCE OF A SORT SIMONOV WHO WAS AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW I HAD A NUMBER OF SCHOOLFELLOWS INDEED IN PETERSBURG
THOUGH INDEED EVEN NOW I AM TO SOME EXTENT SATISFIED WITH THEM DREAMS WERE PARTICULARLY SWEET AND VIVID AFTER A SPELL OF DISSIPATION
DO YOU WANT TO JOIN TOO SIMONOV OBSERVED WITH NO APPEARANCE OF PLEASURE SEEMING TO AVOID LOOKING AT ME HE KNEW ME THROUGH AND THROUGH IT INFURIATED ME THAT HE KNEW ME SO THOROUGHLY WHY NOT
THEY HAD KEPT UP WITH HIM FOR THOSE THREE YEARS THOUGH PRIVATELY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH HIM I AM CONVINCED OF THAT OF SIMONOV'S TWO VISITORS ONE WAS FERFITCHKIN A RUSSIANISED GERMAN
IT'S CLOSE BY NOT TWO PACES AWAY SIMONOV REPEATED ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE FRONT DOOR WITH A FUSSY AIR WHICH DID NOT SUIT HIM AT ALL
THAT IS TO BE TRUTHFUL YES I HAVE TO GO AND SEE SOMEONE NOT FAR FROM HERE
WILL YOU PAY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION NOW I JUST ASK SO AS TO KNOW HE MUTTERED IN EMBARRASSMENT I FLUSHED CRIMSON AS I DID SO I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OWED SIMONOV FIFTEEN ROUBLES FOR AGES
THE LAUGH WAS ON HIS SIDE HE GOT THE BETTER OF ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AFTERWARDS BUT WITHOUT MALICE JESTINGLY CASUALLY I REMAINED ANGRILY AND CONTEMPTUOUSLY SILENT AND WOULD NOT ANSWER HIM WHEN WE LEFT SCHOOL HE MADE ADVANCES TO ME
VEXED THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THAT DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN PAY TOMORROW AFTER THE DINNER I SIMPLY WANTED TO KNOW PLEASE DON'T HE BROKE OFF AND BEGAN PACING THE ROOM STILL MORE VEXED AS HE WALKED HE BEGAN TO STAMP WITH HIS HEELS
BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
OF PERSONAL HONOUR THOUGH OF COURSE HE WAS A WRETCHED LITTLE COWARD AT HEART HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WORSHIPPERS OF ZVERKOV WHO MADE UP TO THE LATTER FROM INTERESTED MOTIVES AND OFTEN BORROWED MONEY FROM HIM SIMONOV'S OTHER VISITOR TRUDOLYUBOV WAS A PERSON IN NO WAY REMARKABLE
AND EVEN MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN THAT IS MY MAKING THIS REMARK NOW BUT THAT'S ENOUGH
THEIR GAMES THEIR CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD NO UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH ESSENTIAL THINGS THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN SUCH STRIKING IMPRESSIVE SUBJECTS THAT I COULD NOT HELP CONSIDERING THEM INFERIOR TO MYSELF
BUT THE GREAT THING WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE ALL READY FOR ME WOULD RISE UP BEFORE ME AND I SHOULD COME OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY ALMOST RIDING A WHITE HORSE AND CROWNED WITH LAUREL ANYTHING BUT THE FOREMOST PLACE I COULD NOT CONCEIVE FOR MYSELF
THAT WAS MY RUIN FOR WHEN I WAS IN THE MUD I COMFORTED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT AT OTHER TIMES I WAS A HERO AND THE HERO WAS A CLOAK FOR THE MUD
THAT I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM OH THERE'S NO MAKING YOU OUT WITH THESE REFINEMENTS TRUDOLYUBOV JEERED WE'LL PUT YOUR NAME DOWN SIMONOV DECIDED ADDRESSING ME
AND LOOKING WITH SAVAGE DISTRUST AT EVERYONE MY SCHOOLFELLOWS MET ME WITH SPITEFUL AND MERCILESS JIBES BECAUSE I WAS NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR TAUNTS
AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE FILTHINESS OF IT
I HAD LET MYSELF GET TOO SLOVENLY MY UNIFORM PERHAPS WAS TIDY BUT I COULD NOT GO OUT TO DINNER IN MY UNIFORM THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT ON THE KNEE OF MY TROUSERS WAS A BIG YELLOW STAIN
A TALL YOUNG FELLOW IN THE ARMY WITH A COLD FACE FAIRLY HONEST THOUGH HE WORSHIPPED SUCCESS OF EVERY SORT AND WAS ONLY CAPABLE OF THINKING OF PROMOTION HE WAS SOME SORT OF DISTANT RELATION OF ZVERKOV'S AND THIS
USUALLY A COLLEAGUE FROM OUR OFFICE OR SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT I NEVER SAW MORE THAN TWO OR THREE VISITORS THERE ALWAYS THE SAME THEY TALKED ABOUT THE EXCISE DUTY
AND REPULSED HIM AS THOUGH ALL I NEEDED HIM FOR WAS TO WIN A VICTORY OVER HIM TO SUBJUGATE HIM AND NOTHING ELSE BUT I COULD NOT SUBJUGATE ALL OF THEM MY FRIEND WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THEM EITHER HE WAS IN FACT A RARE EXCEPTION
AM I KEEPING YOU I ASKED AFTER TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE
IT WAS FOLLOWED BY REMORSE I TRIED TO DRIVE IT AWAY I FELT TOO SICK
BY THEN HE WAS WEARING SHOULDER STRAPS HE WAS TWISTING AND TWIRLING ABOUT INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF AN ANCIENT GENERAL IN THREE YEARS HE HAD GONE OFF CONSIDERABLY THOUGH HE WAS STILL RATHER HANDSOME AND ADROIT
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FAVOURED BY THE GIFTS OF NATURE MOREOVER IT WAS AS IT WERE AN ACCEPTED IDEA AMONG US THAT ZVERKOV WAS A SPECIALIST IN REGARD TO TACT AND THE SOCIAL GRACES THIS LAST FACT PARTICULARLY INFURIATED ME
WITH WHAT IMPUDENT RUDENESS THE INSECT FERFITCHKIN WOULD SNIGGER AT ME IN ORDER TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH ZVERKOV HOW COMPLETELY SIMONOV WOULD TAKE IT ALL IN AND HOW HE WOULD DESPISE ME FOR THE ABJECTNESS OF MY VANITY AND LACK OF SPIRIT
HE ALL AT ONCE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE A SINGLE VILLAGE GIRL ON HIS ESTATE UNNOTICED
I HATED THE WAY IN WHICH HE USED TO TALK OF HIS FUTURE CONQUESTS OF WOMEN HE DID NOT VENTURE TO BEGIN HIS ATTACK UPON WOMEN UNTIL HE HAD THE EPAULETTES OF AN OFFICER AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM WITH IMPATIENCE AND BOASTED OF THE DUELS HE WOULD CONSTANTLY BE FIGHTING
I WAS A TERRIBLE DREAMER I WOULD DREAM FOR THREE MONTHS ON END TUCKED AWAY IN MY CORNER AND YOU MAY BELIEVE ME THAT AT THOSE MOMENTS I HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE PERTURBATION OF HIS CHICKEN HEART
MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
NOT TO PAY HIM WAS IMPOSSIBLE CONSIDERING HIS CHARACTER BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT FELLOW ABOUT THAT PLAGUE OF MINE ANOTHER TIME HOWEVER I KNEW I SHOULD GO AND SHOULD NOT PAY HIM HIS WAGES THAT NIGHT I HAD THE MOST HIDEOUS DREAMS
AND FOR THAT VERY REASON I QUITE CONTENTEDLY OCCUPIED THE LOWEST IN REALITY EITHER TO BE A HERO OR TO GROVEL IN THE MUD THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN
OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
I GREW USED TO EVERYTHING OR RATHER I VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED MYSELF TO ENDURING IT BUT I HAD A MEANS OF ESCAPE THAT RECONCILED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO FIND REFUGE IN THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL IN DREAMS OF COURSE
I KNEW TOO PERFECTLY WELL EVEN THEN THAT I WAS MONSTROUSLY EXAGGERATING THE FACTS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT
AND YET YOU ARE RIGHT IT REALLY IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE
JUST BECAUSE HE WAS A PRETTY AND PLAYFUL BOY HE WAS ALWAYS BAD AT HIS LESSONS AND GOT WORSE AND WORSE AS HE WENT ON HOWEVER HE LEFT WITH A GOOD CERTIFICATE AS HE HAD POWERFUL INTERESTS DURING HIS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE CAME IN FOR AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS
AND WERE ONLY SUFFICIENTLY PRESENT TO SERVE AS AN APPETISING SAUCE THAT SAUCE WAS MADE UP OF CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS OF AGONISING INWARD ANALYSIS AND ALL THESE PANGS AND PIN PRICKS GAVE A CERTAIN PIQUANCY
WITH DESPAIR I PICTURED TO MYSELF HOW COLDLY AND DISDAINFULLY THAT SCOUNDREL ZVERKOV WOULD MEET ME
I CAME IN FOR COUNTLESS MILLIONS AND IMMEDIATELY DEVOTED THEM TO HUMANITY AND AT THE SAME TIME I CONFESSED BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE MY SHAMEFUL DEEDS WHICH OF COURSE WERE NOT MERELY SHAMEFUL BUT HAD IN THEM
THEY WERE MONSTROUSLY DEPRAVED OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT TOO WAS SUPERFICIAL AND AN ASSUMPTION OF CYNICISM OF COURSE THERE WERE GLIMPSES OF YOUTH AND FRESHNESS EVEN IN THEIR DEPRAVITY BUT EVEN THAT FRESHNESS WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE
WHO HAD IN NO WAY BEEN DISTINGUISHED AT SCHOOL WAS OF A QUIET AND EQUABLE DISPOSITION BUT I DISCOVERED IN HIM A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER AND EVEN HONESTY I DON'T EVEN SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY STUPID
WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DINNER ZVERKOV OF COURSE WON'T PAY OF COURSE NOT SINCE WE ARE INVITING HIM SIMONOV DECIDED CAN YOU IMAGINE FERFITCHKIN INTERRUPTED HOTLY AND CONCEITEDLY
BUT I DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND HAD EVEN GIVEN UP NODDING TO THEM IN THE STREET I BELIEVE I HAD TRANSFERRED INTO THE DEPARTMENT I WAS IN SIMPLY TO AVOID THEIR COMPANY AND TO CUT OFF ALL CONNECTION WITH MY HATEFUL CHILDHOOD
ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
I KNEW OF COURSE THAT THEY MUST DESPISE ME NOW FOR MY LACK OF SUCCESS IN THE SERVICE AND FOR MY HAVING LET MYSELF SINK SO LOW GOING ABOUT BADLY DRESSED AND SO ON WHICH SEEMED TO THEM A SIGN OF MY INCAPACITY AND INSIGNIFICANCE
AND THE BEST MEANS OF PLEASING HIM AND SO ON I HAD THE PATIENCE TO SIT LIKE A FOOL BESIDE THESE PEOPLE
CURSES ON THAT SCHOOL AND ALL THOSE TERRIBLE YEARS OF PENAL SERVITUDE IN SHORT I PARTED FROM MY SCHOOLFELLOWS AS SOON AS I GOT OUT INTO THE WORLD THERE WERE TWO OR THREE LEFT TO WHOM I NODDED IN THE STREET ONE OF THEM WAS SIMONOV
BUT WHY IS IT CONTEMPTIBLE CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I AM ASHAMED OF IT ALL AND THAT IT WAS STUPIDER THAN ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE GENTLEMEN AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SOME OF THESE FANCIES WERE BY NO MEANS BADLY COMPOSED
INTO THE STREET NO I HAD A LOFTY WAY OF GETTING OUT OF IT ALL
SIMONOV WHO HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED FINALLY HOW TWENTY ONE ROUBLES I ASKED IN SOME AGITATION WITH A SHOW OF BEING OFFENDED
I HAD A FOREBODING THAT THAT STAIN WOULD DEPRIVE ME OF NINE TENTHS OF MY PERSONAL DIGNITY I KNEW TOO THAT IT WAS VERY POOR TO THINK SO BUT THIS IS NO TIME FOR THINKING NOW I AM IN FOR THE REAL THING I THOUGHT AND MY HEART SANK
WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY FERFITCHKIN BEGAN IN AN UNDERTONE INDICATING ME TO SIMONOV BUT HE BROKE OFF FOR EVEN SIMONOV WAS EMBARRASSED THAT WILL DO SAID TRUDOLYUBOV GETTING UP IF HE WANTS TO COME SO MUCH LET HIM
AND THEY ALL AGITATED AND OVERWHELMED ME I POLISHED MY BOOTS A SECOND TIME WITH MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE INDUCED APOLLON TO CLEAN THEM TWICE A DAY AS HE CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN HIS DUTIES REQUIRED OF HIM
I WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL BY DISTANT RELATIONS UPON WHOM I WAS DEPENDENT AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE THEY SENT ME THERE A FORLORN SILENT BOY ALREADY CRUSHED BY THEIR REPROACHES ALREADY TROUBLED BY DOUBT
I DID NOT REBUFF THEM FOR I WAS FLATTERED BUT WE SOON PARTED AND QUITE NATURALLY AFTERWARDS I HEARD OF HIS BARRACK ROOM SUCCESS AS A LIEUTENANT AND OF THE FAST LIFE HE WAS LEADING THEN THERE CAME OTHER RUMOURS
WE WOULD BE RECONCILED AND DRINK TO OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP BUT WHAT WAS MOST BITTER AND HUMILIATING FOR ME WAS THAT I KNEW EVEN THEN KNEW FULLY AND FOR CERTAIN THAT I NEEDED NOTHING OF ALL THIS REALLY THAT I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO CRUSH
ONCE INDEED I DID HAVE A FRIEND
TRUDOLYUBOV BARELY NODDED SIMONOV WITH WHOM I WAS LEFT TETE A TETE WAS IN A STATE OF VEXATION AND PERPLEXITY AND LOOKED AT ME QUEERLY
ALL THIS DISCONCERTED ME I SAT DOWN FEELING RATHER MISERABLE AND BEGAN LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE ENGAGED IN WARM AND EARNEST CONVERSATION ABOUT A FAREWELL DINNER WHICH THEY WANTED TO ARRANGE FOR THE NEXT DAY TO A COMRADE OF THEIRS CALLED ZVERKOV
SO THE THREE OF US WITH ZVERKOV FOR THE FOURTH
GAVE HIM A CERTAIN IMPORTANCE AMONG US HE ALWAYS THOUGHT ME OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ME THOUGH NOT QUITE COURTEOUS WAS TOLERABLE WELL WITH SEVEN ROUBLES EACH SAID TRUDOLYUBOV TWENTY ONE ROUBLES BETWEEN THE THREE OF US
AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
THEIR COARSENESS REVOLTED ME THEY LAUGHED CYNICALLY AT MY FACE AT MY CLUMSY FIGURE AND YET WHAT STUPID FACES THEY HAD THEMSELVES IN OUR SCHOOL THE BOYS FACES SEEMED IN A SPECIAL WAY TO DEGENERATE AND GROW STUPIDER
THEY BOTH HAD SNUB NOSES AND I WAS AWFULLY SHY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE ALWAYS WHISPERING AND GIGGLING TOGETHER THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE USUALLY SAT IN HIS STUDY ON A LEATHER COUCH IN FRONT OF THE TABLE WITH SOME GREY HEADED GENTLEMAN
BUT DID NOT BANISH THE DISSIPATION BY THEIR APPEARANCE ON THE CONTRARY
AND THAT IF THE PEASANTS DARED TO PROTEST HE WOULD HAVE THEM ALL FLOGGED AND DOUBLE THE TAX ON THEM THE BEARDED RASCALS OUR SERVILE RABBLE APPLAUDED BUT I ATTACKED HIM NOT FROM COMPASSION FOR THE GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS
AND AS ALMOST ALL OF US WERE POOR HE TOOK UP A SWAGGERING TONE AMONG US HE WAS VULGAR IN THE EXTREME BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A GOOD NATURED FELLOW EVEN IN HIS SWAGGERING
I HAD BETTER NOT GO OF COURSE I MUST JUST SNAP MY FINGERS AT THEM
I COULD NEVER STAND MORE THAN THREE MONTHS OF DREAMING AT A TIME WITHOUT FEELING AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY MEANT
HIS AT HOME DAY SO I HAD ALWAYS TO TIME MY PASSIONATE DESIRE TO EMBRACE HUMANITY SO THAT IT MIGHT FALL ON A TUESDAY THIS ANTON ANTONITCH LIVED ON THE FOURTH STOREY IN A HOUSE IN FIVE CORNERS IN FOUR LOW PITCHED ROOMS
TWENTY EIGHT ROUBLES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT TO INVITE MYSELF SO SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY WOULD BE POSITIVELY GRACEFUL AND THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE CONQUERED AT ONCE
HOW MANY FINE LOOKING BOYS CAME TO US IN A FEW YEARS THEY BECAME REPULSIVE EVEN AT SIXTEEN I WONDERED AT THEM MOROSELY EVEN THEN I WAS STRUCK BY THE PETTINESS OF THEIR THOUGHTS THE STUPIDITY OF THEIR PURSUITS
WITH YEARS A CRAVING FOR SOCIETY FOR FRIENDS DEVELOPED IN ME I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH SOME OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER MY INTIMACY WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS STRAINED AND SOON ENDED OF ITSELF
MY GOODNESS WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO I CRIED
BY SOME EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALL THIS WOULD SUDDENLY OPEN OUT EXPAND THAT SUDDENLY A VISTA OF SUITABLE ACTIVITY BENEFICENT GOOD AND ABOVE ALL READY MADE WHAT SORT OF ACTIVITY I HAD NO IDEA
AND WORST OF ALL HOW PALTRY UNLITERARY COMMONPLACE IT WOULD ALL BE
BUT THAT WAS MOST IMPOSSIBLE OF ALL IF I FEEL IMPELLED TO DO ANYTHING I SEEM TO BE PITCHFORKED INTO IT I SHOULD HAVE JEERED AT MYSELF EVER AFTERWARDS SO YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED THE REAL THING
TO VISIT MY SUPERIOR AT THE OFFICE ANTON ANTONITCH SYETOTCHKIN HE WAS THE ONLY PERMANENT ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE
ON THE CONTRARY I CONTINUALLY LONGED FOR THEIR HUMILIATION TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR DERISION I PURPOSELY BEGAN TO MAKE ALL THE PROGRESS I COULD WITH MY STUDIES AND FORCED MY WAY TO THE VERY TOP THIS IMPRESSED THEM
A LITTLE FELLOW WITH THE FACE OF A MONKEY A BLOCKHEAD WHO WAS ALWAYS DERIDING EVERYONE A VERY BITTER ENEMY OF MINE FROM OUR DAYS IN THE LOWER FORMS A VULGAR IMPUDENT SWAGGERING FELLOW WHO AFFECTED A MOST SENSITIVE FEELING
I AM AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS TOO I BELIEVE AND I MUST OWN I FEEL HURT THAT YOU HAVE LEFT ME OUT I SAID BOILING OVER AGAIN AND WHERE WERE WE TO FIND YOU FERFITCHKIN PUT IN ROUGHLY YOU NEVER WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ZVERKOV TRUDOLYUBOV ADDED FROWNING
I REMEMBER HOW I INVARIABLY SO TACITURN SUDDENLY FASTENED UPON ZVERKOV WHEN ONE DAY TALKING AT A LEISURE MOMENT WITH HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS OF HIS FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE FAIR SEX AND GROWING AS SPORTIVE AS A PUPPY IN THE SUN
ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
IT WAS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THAT DROVE ME TO IT AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT THRUST UPON ME YOUR HACKNEYED REMARKS REPEATED TO NAUSEA THAT I WAS ONLY A DREAMER WHILE THEY EVEN THEN HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE
BY THEN HE HAD TAKEN TO CUTTING ME IN THE STREET AND I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF COMPROMISING HIMSELF BY GREETING A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS ME I SAW HIM ONCE IN THE THEATRE IN THE THIRD TIER OF BOXES
BUT WHAT MADE ME FURIOUS WAS THAT I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD GO THAT I SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF GOING AND THE MORE TACTLESS THE MORE UNSEEMLY MY GOING WOULD BE THE MORE CERTAINLY I WOULD GO AND THERE WAS A POSITIVE OBSTACLE TO MY GOING
THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SUCH POSITIVE INTOXICATION OF SUCH HAPPINESS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF IRONY WITHIN ME ON MY HONOUR I HAD FAITH HOPE LOVE I BELIEVED BLINDLY AT SUCH TIMES THAT BY SOME MIRACLE
THOUGH HE WAS BOLD IN HIS LANGUAGE I HATED HIS HANDSOME BUT STUPID FACE FOR WHICH I WOULD HOWEVER HAVE GLADLY EXCHANGED MY INTELLIGENT ONE AND THE FREE AND EASY MILITARY MANNERS IN FASHION IN THE FORTIES
I COULD NOT GIVE IN TO THEM WITH THE IGNOBLE READINESS WITH WHICH THEY GAVE IN TO ONE ANOTHER I HATED THEM FROM THE FIRST AND SHUT MYSELF AWAY FROM EVERYONE IN TIMID WOUNDED AND DISPROPORTIONATE PRIDE
HE WAS VERY GLAD TO GET RID OF ME I WAS IN A FURY WHAT POSSESSED ME WHAT POSSESSED ME TO FORCE MYSELF UPON THEM I WONDERED GRINDING MY TEETH AS I STRODE ALONG THE STREET FOR A SCOUNDREL A PIG LIKE THAT ZVERKOV OF COURSE
NOT BEING QUITE CERTAIN OF IT
THEY TOOK RANK FOR INTELLIGENCE EVEN AT SIXTEEN THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT A SNUG BERTH OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS DUE TO THEIR STUPIDITY TO THE BAD EXAMPLES WITH WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD
MOREOVER THEY ALL BEGAN BY DEGREES TO GRASP THAT I HAD ALREADY READ BOOKS NONE OF THEM COULD READ AND UNDERSTOOD THINGS NOT FORMING PART OF OUR SCHOOL CURRICULUM OF WHICH THEY HAD NOT EVEN HEARD THEY TOOK A SAVAGE AND SARCASTIC VIEW OF IT
BEFORE ME THEN WHAT WERE MY DREAMS
THIS ZVERKOV HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME AT SCHOOL WITH ME TOO I HAD BEGUN TO HATE HIM PARTICULARLY IN THE UPPER FORMS IN THE LOWER FORMS HE HAD SIMPLY BEEN A PRETTY PLAYFUL BOY WHOM EVERYBODY LIKED I HAD HATED HIM HOWEVER EVEN IN THE LOWER FORMS
THE FIRST THING I DID ON LEAVING SCHOOL WAS TO GIVE UP THE SPECIAL JOB FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN DESTINED SO AS TO BREAK ALL TIES
I STOLE THE BRUSHES TO CLEAN THEM FROM THE PASSAGE BEING CAREFUL HE SHOULD NOT DETECT IT FOR FEAR OF HIS CONTEMPT
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE APPLAUDING SUCH AN INSECT I GOT THE BETTER OF HIM ON THAT OCCASION BUT THOUGH ZVERKOV WAS STUPID HE WAS LIVELY AND IMPUDENT AND SO LAUGHED IT OFF AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT MY VICTORY WAS NOT REALLY COMPLETE
ALL OF THEM TOOK SCARCELY ANY NOTICE OF MY ENTRANCE WHICH WAS STRANGE FOR I HAD NOT MET THEM FOR YEARS EVIDENTLY THEY LOOKED UPON ME AS SOMETHING ON THE LEVEL OF A COMMON FLY I HAD NOT BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT EVEN AT SCHOOL THOUGH THEY ALL HATED ME
AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHY AFTER ALL THAT I SHOULD GO TRUDGING OFF TO SIMONOV'S EARLY NEXT MORNING I ROUSED MYSELF AND JUMPED OUT OF BED WITH EXCITEMENT AS THOUGH IT WERE ALL ABOUT TO HAPPEN AT ONCE
BUT THESE HAD NOT LASTED LONG AND HAD SOMEHOW BEEN SUDDENLY CLOUDED OVER HE WAS EVIDENTLY UNCOMFORTABLE AT THESE REMINISCENCES AND WAS I FANCY ALWAYS AFRAID THAT I MIGHT TAKE UP THE SAME TONE AGAIN
EVEN A SIGNIFICANCE TO MY DISSIPATION IN FACT COMPLETELY ANSWERED THE PURPOSE OF AN APPETISING SAUCE THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEPTH OF MEANING IN IT AND I COULD HARDLY HAVE RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE SIMPLE VULGAR DIRECT DEBAUCHERY OF A CLERK
WHICH I HAD INDEED NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH I HAD NOT PAID IT
THAT IT BECAME ESSENTIAL AT ONCE TO EMBRACE MY FELLOWS AND ALL MANKIND AND FOR THAT PURPOSE I NEEDED AT LEAST ONE HUMAN BEING ACTUALLY EXISTING I HAD TO CALL ON ANTON ANTONITCH HOWEVER ON TUESDAY
BUT THEY SAID IT IS NO LOW CASTE PERSON BUT DHARMU THEN THEY BATHED HIM AND ANOINTED HIM WITH OIL AND TURMERIC AND WRAPPED HIM IN THE NEW CLOTH WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT AND THUS THEY PERSUADED HIM TO RETURN
AND AS HE SAW THEIR DRIPPING CORPSES ON AN IMAGINED FIELD HE SAID THAT HE WAS THEIR MURDERER AGAIN HE THOUGHT
THEY OCCUPIED THEMSELVES AGAIN IN DRAGGING THEIR OWN TRAGEDIES TOWARD THE REAR SUDDENLY AS THE TWO FRIENDS MARCHED ON THE TALL SOLDIER SEEMED TO BE OVERCOME BY A TREMOR HIS FACE TURNED TO A SEMBLANCE OF GRAY PASTE
WHILE HE HAD BEEN TOSSED BY MANY EMOTIONS HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF AILMENTS NOW THE BESET HIM
ALSO HE CONTINUED IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE IF HE FOUND HIS REGIMENT WELL HE COULD FIGHT WITH ANY REGIMENT HE STARTED FORWARD SLOWLY HE STEPPED AS IF HE EXPECTED TO TREAD UPON SOME EXPLOSIVE THING
HE TOLD DHARMU AND HIS WIFE TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND COME AND EAT BUT THEY ANSWERED THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE HOUSEHOLD AND THAT THE HIRED LABOURERS SHOULD BE FED FIRST SO THE LABOURERS ATE AND THEY ATE UP ALL THE RICE
AND KARAM GOSAIN CAME DOWN TO SEE WHAT PREPARATIONS DHARMU WAS MAKING IN HIS HONOUR AND HE WATCHED FROM THE BACK OF THE HOUSE JUST THEN DHARMU STRAINED OFF THE WATER FROM THE COOKED RICE
HE WAS A CRAVEN LOON THOSE PICTURES OF GLORY WERE PITEOUS THINGS HE GROANED FROM HIS HEART AND WENT STAGGERING OFF A CERTAIN MOTHLIKE QUALITY WITHIN HIM KEPT HIM IN THE VICINITY OF THE BATTLE
THE TALL SOLDIER MADE A LITTLE COMMONPLACE SMILE HELLO HENRY HE SAID THE YOUTH SWAYED ON HIS LEGS AND GLARED STRANGELY HE STUTTERED AND STAMMERED OH JIM OH JIM
AND THEY ASKED HOW THEY SHOULD PROPITIATE HIM AND THE VOICE SAID GRIND TURMERIC AND PUT IT ON A PLATE AND BUY NEW CLOTH AND DYE IT WITH TURMERIC AND MAKE READY OIL AND TAKE THESE THINGS TO THE GANGES
WITH SUDDEN LIVID RAGE TOWARD THE BATTLEFIELD HE SHOOK HIS FIST HE SEEMED ABOUT TO DELIVER A PHILIPPIC HELL THE RED SUN WAS PASTED IN THE SKY
AND HE DID NOT CONCEIVE PUBLIC OPINION TO BE ACCURATE AT LONG RANGE IT WAS QUITE PROBABLE THEY WOULD HIT THE WRONG MAN WHO AFTER HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS AMAZEMENT WOULD PERHAPS SPEND THE REST OF HIS DAYS
HE BELIEVED THAT HE ENVIED A CORPSE THINKING OF THE SLAIN HE ACHIEVED A GREAT CONTEMPT FOR SOME OF THEM AS IF THEY WERE GUILTY FOR THUS BECOMING LIFELESS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN KILLED BY LUCKY CHANCES HE SAID
HE STARTED BLINDLY THROUGH THE GRASS THE YOUTH TURNED ONCE TO LOOK AT THE LASHING RIDERS AND JOUNCING GUNS OF THE BATTERY HE WAS STARTLED FROM THIS VIEW BY A SHRILL OUTCRY FROM THE TATTERED MAN
THEY BEGAN TO HAVE THOUGHTS OF A SOLEMN CEREMONY THERE WAS SOMETHING RITE LIKE IN THESE MOVEMENTS OF THE DOOMED SOLDIER AND THERE WAS A RESEMBLANCE IN HIM TO A DEVOTEE OF A MAD RELIGION BLOOD SUCKING MUSCLE WRENCHING BONE CRUSHING
SOMETHING IN THE GESTURE OF THE MAN AS HE WAVED THE BLOODY AND PITYING SOLDIERS AWAY MADE THE YOUTH START AS IF BITTEN HE YELLED IN HORROR TOTTERING FORWARD HE LAID A QUIVERING HAND UPON THE MAN'S ARM
BUT THEY HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE MADE UP TO THEM WHEN THE WAGES WERE PAID AND WORKED ON FASTING AT EVENING WHEN THEY CAME TO PAY THE WAGES IN KIND DHARMU'S NAME WAS CALLED OUT FIRST
THERE WOULD BE A ROUNDABOUT VINDICATION OF HIMSELF HE THOUGHT IT WOULD PROVE IN A MANNER THAT HE HAD FLED EARLY BECAUSE OF HIS SUPERIOR POWERS OF PERCEPTION A SERIOUS PROPHET UPON PREDICTING A FLOOD SHOULD BE THE FIRST MAN TO CLIMB A TREE
THUS MANY MEN OF COURAGE HE CONSIDERED WOULD BE OBLIGED TO DESERT THE COLORS AND SCURRY LIKE CHICKENS HE WOULD APPEAR AS ONE OF THEM THEY WOULD BE SULLEN BROTHERS IN DISTRESS AND HE COULD THEN EASILY BELIEVE
IN WRITING REPLIES TO THE SONGS OF HIS ALLEGED FAILURE IT WOULD BE VERY UNFORTUNATE NO DOUBT BUT IN THIS CASE A GENERAL WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO THE YOUTH IN A DEFEAT
TO FORCE THEIR WAY TO GRIM CHANCES OF DEATH AS HE WATCHED HIS ENVY GREW UNTIL HE THOUGHT THAT HE WISHED TO CHANGE LIVES WITH ONE OF THEM HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE USED A TREMENDOUS FORCE HE SAID THROW OFF HIMSELF AND BECOME A BETTER
BUT HE TOLD HIS BROTHER TO PAY THE LABOURERS FIRST AND IN DOING THIS THE PADDY WAS ALL USED UP AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR DHARMU AND HIS WIFE SO THEY WENT HOME SORROWFULLY AND THEIR CHILDREN CRIED FOR FOOD
THEN IT BEGAN TO SWING FORWARD SLOW AND STRAIGHT IN THE MANNER OF A FALLING TREE A SWIFT MUSCULAR CONTORTION MADE THE LEFT SHOULDER STRIKE THE GROUND FIRST
OF THE OTHER LABOURERS AND THE LABOURERS ALSO TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS NOT SUITABLE FOR HIM TO WORK AS A LABOURER HIMSELF BUT DHARMU SAID
THE BODY SEEMED TO BOUNCE A LITTLE WAY FROM THE EARTH GOD SAID THE TATTERED SOLDIER THE YOUTH HAD WATCHED SPELLBOUND THIS CEREMONY AT THE PLACE OF MEETING
HE WAS NOT CAST DOWN BY THIS DEFEAT OF HIS PLAN FOR UPON STUDYING THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY HE COULD NOT BUT ADMIT THAT THE OBJECTIONS WERE VERY FORMIDABLE FURTHERMORE VARIOUS AILMENTS HAD BEGUN TO CRY OUT
AND THREW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW AND IT FELL ON KARAM GOSAIN AND SCALDED HIM AND AS THE FLIES AND INSECTS WORRIED THE WOUND KARAM GOSAIN WENT OFF TO THE GANGES AND BURIED HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM
PRESENTLY THE CALM HEAD OF A FORWARD GOING COLUMN OF INFANTRY APPEARED IN THE ROAD IT CAME SWIFTLY ON AVOIDING THE OBSTRUCTIONS GAVE IT THE SINUOUS MOVEMENT OF A SERPENT THE MEN AT THE HEAD
COME LET US UNDO THE WORK WE DID TO DAY YOU CUT DOWN THE EMBANKMENTS YOU REPAIRED AND I WILL UPROOT THE SEEDLINGS WHICH I PLANTED SO THEY WENT OUT INTO THE NIGHT TO DO THIS BUT WHENEVER DHARMU RAISED HIS SPADE A VOICE CALLED OUT
AND ONCE AS HIS FRIEND ROLLED HIS EYES HE SAW SOMETHING IN THEM THAT MADE HIM SINK WAILING TO THE GROUND HE RAISED HIS VOICE IN A LAST SUPREME CALL JIM JIM JIM
THE YOUTH FELL BACK IN THE PROCESSION UNTIL THE TATTERED SOLDIER WAS NOT IN SIGHT THEN HE STARTED TO WALK ON WITH THE OTHERS BUT HE WAS AMID WOUNDS THE MOB OF MEN WAS BLEEDING
HE WAS QUICK TO SEE VULNERABLE PLACES IN THEM ALL FURTHERMORE HE WAS MUCH AFRAID THAT SOME ARROW OF SCORN MIGHT LAY HIM MENTALLY LOW BEFORE HE COULD RAISE HIS PROTECTING TALE
THE WOODS FILTERED MEN AND THE FIELDS BECAME DOTTED AS HE ROUNDED A HILLOCK HE PERCEIVED THAT THE ROADWAY WAS NOW A CRYING MASS OF WAGONS TEAMS AND MEN
FROM THE HEAVING TANGLE ISSUED EXHORTATIONS COMMANDS IMPRECATIONS FEAR WAS SWEEPING IT ALL ALONG THE CRACKING WHIPS BIT AND HORSES PLUNGED AND TUGGED
AND MEN SLOWING TO HIS DREARY PACE WERE WALKING WITH HIM THEY WERE DISCUSSING HIS PLIGHT QUESTIONING HIM AND GIVING HIM ADVICE IN A DOGGED WAY HE REPELLED THEM
AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR DHARMU AND HIS WIFE WHEN THE MIDDAY MEAL WAS BROUGHT THE SAME THING HAPPENED
AND THEY SAW UNDER A BANYAN TREE A LARGE POT FULL OF RUPEES BUT THEY WERE SO DISHEARTENED THAT THEY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO TOUCH IT THEN THEY MET A WOMAN WHO ASKED WHERE THEY WERE GOING AND WHEN SHE HEARD SHE SAID
BEGAN QUAVERINGLY TO QUESTION HIM WHERE YEH GOIN JIM WHAT YOU THINKING ABOUT WHERE YOU GOING TELL ME WON'T YOU JIM THE TALL SOLDIER FACED ABOUT AS UPON RELENTLESS PURSUERS
THEN THEY MET A WOMAN WITH BOTH HER FEET BURNING IN A FIRE AND ANOTHER WITH A STOOL STUCK FAST TO HER BACK AND THEY PROMISED TO ENQUIRE HOW THESE MIGHT BE DELIVERED
LET HER DO SO IN FUTURE AND SHE WILL BE FREED AND THE WOMAN HAS HER FEET BURNING IN THE FIRE BECAUSE SHE PUSHED THE FUEL INTO THE FIRE WITH HER FOOT LET HER NOT DO SO IN FUTURE AND SHE WILL BE FREED
SHOWED IN A LAUGH AS THE FLAP OF THE BLUE JACKET FELL AWAY FROM THE BODY HE COULD SEE THAT THE SIDE LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN CHEWED BY WOLVES THE YOUTH TURNED
AS IF HE WERE TAKING INFINITE CARE NOT TO AROUSE THE PASSION OF HIS WOUNDS AS HE WENT ON HE SEEMED ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A PLACE LIKE ONE WHO GOES TO CHOOSE A GRAVE
THEY PAUSED AND STOOD EXPECTANT THERE WAS A SILENCE FINALLY THE CHEST OF THE DOOMED SOLDIER BEGAN TO HEAVE WITH A STRAINED MOTION
AND THEY WENT TO EAT THE FRUIT BUT WHEN THEY GOT NEAR THEY FOUND THAT ALL THE FIGS WERE FULL OF GRUBS AND THEY SANG EXHAUSTED BY HUNGER WE CAME TO A FIG TREE AND FOUND IT FULL OF GRUBS
I GOT SHOT YES B'JIMINEY I GOT SHOT HE REITERATED THIS FACT IN A BEWILDERED WAY AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT CAME ABOUT
AND APPEARING WITH THE VALOR AND CONFIDENCE OF UNCONQUERED LEGIONS THE SHRILLING VOICES OF THE PEOPLE AT HOME WOULD PIPE DISMALLY FOR A TIME
HE CLUTCHED THE YOUTH'S ARM AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HIM AS IF DREADING TO BE OVERHEARD THEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK IN A SHAKING WHISPER I TELL YEH WHAT I'M FRAID OF HENRY I'LL TELL YEH WHAT I'M FRAID OF
THEN AS IF THE HEADS WERE MOVED BY ONE MUSCLE ALL THE FACES WERE TURNED TOWARD HIM WITH WIDE DERISIVE GRINS HE SEEMED TO HEAR SOME ONE MAKE A HUMOROUS REMARK IN A LOW TONE AT IT THE OTHERS ALL CROWED AND CACKLED
THE WHITE TOPPED WAGONS STRAINED AND STUMBLED IN THEIR EXERTIONS LIKE FAT SHEEP THE YOUTH FELT COMFORTED IN A MEASURE BY THIS SIGHT THEY WERE ALL RETREATING PERHAPS THEN HE WAS NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL
PRESENTLY THE LATTER HEARD A VOICE TALKING SOFTLY NEAR HIS SHOULDER TURNING HE SAW THAT IT BELONGED TO THE TATTERED SOLDIER
SIGNING TO THEM TO GO ON AND LEAVE HIM ALONE THE SHADOWS OF HIS FACE WERE DEEPENING AND HIS TIGHT LIPS SEEMED HOLDING IN CHECK THE MOAN OF GREAT DESPAIR THERE COULD BE SEEN A CERTAIN STIFFNESS IN THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS BODY
BUT THEN HE SAID THAT HIS TIRELESS FATE WOULD BRING FORTH WHEN THE STRIFE LULLED FOR A MOMENT A MAN TO ASK OF HIM AN EXPLANATION
THAT PREVIOUSLY THE ARMY HAD ENCOUNTERED GREAT DEFEATS AND IN A FEW MONTHS HAD SHAKEN OFF ALL BLOOD AND TRADITION OF THEM EMERGING AS BRIGHT AND VALIANT AS A NEW ONE THRUSTING OUT OF SIGHT THE MEMORY OF DISASTER
HE MOVED WITH MYSTERIOUS PURPOSE AND ALL OF THE YOUTH'S OFFERS HE BRUSHED ASIDE NO NO LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE THE YOUTH HAD TO FOLLOW
THE TALL SOLDIER WEAKLY TRIED TO WRENCH HIMSELF FREE HUH HE SAID VACANTLY HE STARED AT THE YOUTH FOR A MOMENT AT LAST HE SPOKE AS IF DIMLY COMPREHENDING
IF THE MEN WERE ADVANCING THEIR INDIFFERENT FEET WERE TRAMPLING UPON HIS CHANCES FOR A SUCCESSFUL LIFE AS THESE THOUGHTS WENT RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS MIND HE TURNED UPON THEM AND TRIED TO THRUST THEM AWAY
O KARAM GOSAIN HOW FAR OFF ARE YOU BUT THE COW SAID TO THEM GO TO THE BANKS OF THE GANGES THEN THEY CAME TO A BUFFALO AND WENT TO MILK IT BUT IT LOWERED ITS HEAD AND CHARGED THEM
BUT AS HE MORTALLY FEARED THESE SHAFTS IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO INVENT A TALE HE FELT HE COULD TRUST HE EXPERIMENTED WITH MANY SCHEMES BUT THREW THEM ASIDE ONE BY ONE AS FLIMSY
HE HAD A GREAT DESIRE TO SEE AND TO GET NEWS HE WISHED TO KNOW WHO WAS WINNING HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT DESPITE HIS UNPRECEDENTED SUFFERING HE HAD NEVER LOST HIS GREED FOR A VICTORY
HE IMAGINED THE WHOLE REGIMENT SAYING WHERE'S HENRY FLEMING
I'D DO IT FER YOU WOULDN'T I HENRY HE PAUSED IN PITEOUS ANXIETY TO AWAIT HIS FRIEND'S REPLY THE YOUTH HAD REACHED AN ANGUISH WHERE THE SOBS SCORCHED HIM HE STROVE TO EXPRESS HIS LOYALTY
HE PROTESTED IN A DULLED WAY KEEPING HIS EYES FASTENED ON THE MYSTIC PLACE OF HIS INTENTIONS NO NO DON'T TECH ME LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE THE YOUTH AGHAST AND FILLED WITH WONDER AT THE TALL SOLDIER
JIM JIM WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHAT MAKES YOU DO THIS WAY YOU'LL HURT YERSELF THE SAME PURPOSE WAS IN THE TALL SOLDIER'S FACE
THIS IMPORTANCE MADE THEIR FACES GRAVE AND STERN AND THE BACKS OF THE OFFICERS WERE VERY RIGID AS THE YOUTH LOOKED AT THEM THE BLACK WEIGHT OF HIS WOE RETURNED TO HIM
FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FALL HE CONSIDERED NOW HOWEVER THAT IT WAS USELESS TO THINK OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY
AS HE WAS AT LAST COMPELLED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THEM HIS CAPACITY FOR SELF HATE WAS MULTIPLIED IN DESPAIR HE DECLARED THAT HE WAS NOT LIKE THOSE OTHERS HE NOW CONCEDED IT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD EVER BECOME A HERO
AND THEY HAD NOTHING TO GIVE THEM IN THE NIGHT DHARMU'S WIFE SAID THEY PROMISED TO PAY US FOR MERELY LOOKING AFTER THE WORK AND INSTEAD WE WORKED HARD AND HAVE STILL GOT NOTHING WE WILL NOT WORK FOR THEM ANYMORE
THE CLANKING ARMS OF THE COLUMN NEAR HIM MADE HIM SOAR ON THE RED WINGS OF WAR FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS SUBLIME HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO START FOR THE FRONT INDEED HE SAW A PICTURE OF HIMSELF
WHATEVER IT WAS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM HE SAID THERE LAY THE FAULT THE HASTE OF THE COLUMN TO REACH THE BATTLE SEEMED TO THE FORLORN YOUNG MAN TO BE SOMETHING MUCH FINER THAN STOUT FIGHTING HEROES HE THOUGHT
DOUBTS AND HE WERE STRUGGLING HE WOULD TRULY BE A WORM IF ANY OF HIS COMRADES SHOULD SEE HIM RETURNING THUS THE MARKS OF HIS FLIGHT UPON HIM
SO THEY ROSE UP TO GO BACK AND DHARMU ASKED ABOUT THE WOMEN WHOM THEY HAD MET AND KARAM GOSAIN SAID THE WOMAN HAS A STOOL STUCK TO HER BACK BECAUSE WHEN VISITORS CAME SHE NEVER OFFERED THEM A SEAT
KARAM GOSAIN PROMISED THEM THAT ON THEIR WAY BACK THEY SHOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF ALL AND THEY DID SO AND MOUNTED ON THE ELEPHANT AND RETURNED TO THEIR HOME WITH GREAT WEALTH
THERE WAS A DULL WEIGHT LIKE FEELING IN HIS STOMACH AND WHEN HE TRIED TO WALK HIS HEAD SWAYED AND HE TOTTERED HE COULD NOT SEE WITH DISTINCTNESS SMALL PATCHES OF GREEN MIST FLOATED BEFORE HIS VISION
THE YOUTH CRIED OUT TO HIM HYSTERICALLY I LL TAKE CARE OF YEH JIM I LL TAKE CARE OF YEH I SWEAR T GAWD I WILL SURE WILL YEH HENRY THE TALL SOLDIER BESEECHED YES YES I TELL YEH I'LL TAKE CARE OF YEH JIM PROTESTED THE YOUTH
DUST STAINED HAGGARD PANTING FLYING TO THE FRONT AT THE PROPER MOMENT TO SEIZE AND THROTTLE THE DARK LEERING WITCH OF CALAMITY THEN THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE THING BEGAN TO DRAG AT HIM HE HESITATED
THERE WAS A REPLY THAT THE INTENT FIGHTERS DID NOT CARE FOR WHAT HAPPENED REARWARD SAVING THAT NO HOSTILE BAYONETS APPEARED THERE IN THE BATTLE BLUR HIS FACE WOULD IN A WAY BE HIDDEN LIKE THE FACE OF A COWLED MAN
HE COULD HAVE WEPT IN HIS LONGINGS HE SEARCHED ABOUT IN HIS MIND FOR AN ADEQUATE MALEDICTION FOR THE INDEFINITE CAUSE THE THING UPON WHICH MEN TURN THE WORDS OF FINAL BLAME IT
AS THE LATTER SLOWLY TURNED HIS WAXLIKE FEATURES TOWARD HIM THE YOUTH SCREAMED
AND THEIR ROBES OF GLORIOUS MEMORIES WERE SHAMS HOWEVER HE STILL SAID THAT IT WAS A GREAT PITY HE WAS NOT AS THEY A DEFEAT OF THE ARMY HAD SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM AS A MEANS OF ESCAPE
HIS FACE HAD BEEN TWISTED INTO AN EXPRESSION OF EVERY AGONY HE HAD IMAGINED FOR HIS FRIEND HE NOW SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND GOING CLOSER GAZED UPON THE PASTELIKE FACE THE MOUTH WAS OPEN AND THE TEETH
AND A HORSE AND A BUFFALO AND A COW AND MONEY AND MANGOES AND FIGS AND DHARMU SAID YES BUT THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO CATCH THE ANIMALS AND THE FRUIT WAS BAD
BECAUSE OF THE TATTERED SOLDIER'S QUESTION HE NOW FELT THAT HIS SHAME COULD BE VIEWED HE WAS CONTINUALLY CASTING SIDELONG GLANCES TO SEE IF THE MEN WERE CONTEMPLATING THE LETTERS OF GUILT HE FELT BURNED INTO HIS BROW
SWIFT PICTURES OF HIMSELF APART YET IN HIMSELF CAME TO HIM A BLUE DESPERATE FIGURE LEADING LURID CHARGES WITH ONE KNEE FORWARD AND A BROKEN BLADE HIGH A BLUE DETERMINED FIGURE
AND IN THE SAME WAY DHARMU'S WIFE MIGHT HAVE ACTED AS OVERSEER OF THE WOMEN BUT SHE WAS ASHAMED NOT TO WORK TOO ONE DAY THEY WERE TRANSPLANTING THE RICE AND KARMU BROUGHT OUT BREAKFAST FOR THE LABOURERS
THE TALL SOLDIER TURNED AND LURCHING DANGEROUSLY WENT ON THE YOUTH AND THE TATTERED SOLDIER FOLLOWED SNEAKING AS IF WHIPPED FEELING UNABLE TO FACE THE STRICKEN MAN IF HE SHOULD AGAIN CONFRONT THEM
COULD FIND EXCUSES IN THAT LONG SEETHING LANE THEY COULD RETIRE WITH PERFECT SELF RESPECT AND MAKE EXCUSES TO THE STARS HE WONDERED WHAT THOSE MEN HAD EATEN THAT THEY COULD BE IN SUCH HASTE
HE TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE ALSO WOULD PERFORM THE CEREMONIES IN HIS HOUSE SO THEY SET TO WORK AND WERE EMPLOYED IN COOKING RICE AND VEGETABLES FAR INTO THE NIGHT
THE RAVING TEAMSTERS SWORE MANY STRANGE OATHS THE COMMANDS TO MAKE WAY HAD THE RING OF A GREAT IMPORTANCE IN THEM THE MEN WERE GOING FORWARD TO THE HEART OF THE DIN THEY WERE TO CONFRONT THE EAGER RUSH OF THE ENEMY
HE SEATED HIMSELF AND WATCHED THE TERROR STRICKEN WAGONS THEY FLED LIKE SOFT UNGAINLY ANIMALS ALL THE ROARERS AND LASHERS SERVED TO HELP HIM TO MAGNIFY THE DANGERS AND HORRORS OF THE ENGAGEMENT
O KARAM GOSAIN HOW FAR OFF ARE YOU THEN THEY CAME TO A MANGO TREE AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED AND THEY WENT ON AND SAW A COW WITH A CALF AND THEY THOUGHT
AS HE HAD THUS OFFENDED KARAM GOSAIN ALL DHARMU'S UNDERTAKINGS FAILED AND HE FELL INTO DEEP POVERTY AND HAD NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO EAT SO HE HAD TO TAKE SERVICE WITH HIS BROTHER KARMU
HE DENOUNCED HIMSELF AS A VILLAIN HE SAID THAT HE WAS THE MOST UNUTTERABLY SELFISH MAN IN EXISTENCE HIS MIND PICTURED THE SOLDIERS WHO WOULD PLACE THEIR DEFIANT BODIES BEFORE THE SPEAR OF THE YELLING BATTLE FIEND
TO DISCOVER WHEN HE WOULD RUN WHEREVER HE WENT IN CAMP HE WOULD ENCOUNTER INSOLENT AND LINGERINGLY CRUEL STARES AS HE IMAGINED HIMSELF PASSING NEAR A CROWD OF COMRADES HE COULD HEAR ONE SAY
HOLD HOLD AND WHENEVER HIS WIFE PUT OUT HER HAND TO PULL UP THE RICE A VOICE CALLED OUT HOLD HOLD THEN THEY SAID WHO ARE YOU WHO STOP US AND THE VOICE ANSWERED
THEY WERE AWED AND AFRAID THEY HUNG BACK LEST HE HAVE AT COMMAND A DREADFUL WEAPON AT LAST THEY SAW HIM STOP AND STAND MOTIONLESS HASTENING UP THEY PERCEIVED THAT HIS FACE WORE AN EXPRESSION
LEAVE ME BE THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE WHILE HE WAITED SUDDENLY HIS FORM STIFFENED AND STRAIGHTENED
BALANCING AWKWARDLY ON ONE FOOT HE HAD NO RIFLE HE COULD NOT FIGHT WITH HIS HANDS SAID HE RESENTFULLY TO HIS PLAN WELL RIFLES COULD BE HAD FOR THE PICKING THEY WERE EXTRAORDINARILY PROFUSE
HE BECAME AWARE THAT THE FURNACE ROAR OF THE BATTLE WAS GROWING LOUDER GREAT BLOWN CLOUDS HAD FLOATED TO THE STILL HEIGHTS OF AIR BEFORE HIM THE NOISE TOO WAS APPROACHING
IT INCREASED IN VIOLENCE UNTIL IT WAS AS IF AN ANIMAL WAS WITHIN AND WAS KICKING AND TUMBLING FURIOUSLY TO BE FREE
THEY FELT THE PRIDE OF THEIR ONWARD MOVEMENT WHEN THE REMAINDER OF THE ARMY SEEMED TRYING TO DRIBBLE DOWN THIS ROAD THEY TUMBLED TEAMS ABOUT WITH A FINE FEELING THAT IT WAS NO MATTER SO LONG AS THEIR COLUMN GOT TO THE FRONT IN TIME
IN THEIR PRESENCE HE COULD NOT PERSIST IN FLYING HIGH WITH THE WINGS OF WAR THEY RENDERED IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SEE HIMSELF IN A HEROIC LIGHT HE TUMBLED HEADLONG HE DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD A SCORCHING THIRST
HE AND THE TATTERED MAN BEGAN A PURSUIT THERE WAS A SINGULAR RACE
I M FRAID I LL FALL DOWN AN THEM YEH KNOW THEM DAMNED ARTILLERY WAGONS
IF THE ARMY HAD GONE GLORIOUSLY ON HE WOULD BE LOST IF THE DIN MEANT THAT NOW HIS ARMY'S FLAGS WERE TILTED FORWARD HE WAS A CONDEMNED WRETCH HE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO DOOM HIMSELF TO ISOLATION
IN HIS EYES THERE WAS A GREAT APPEAL LEAVE ME BE CAN'T YEH LEAVE ME BE FOR A MINNIT THE YOUTH RECOILED WHY JIM HE SAID IN A DAZED WAY WHAT S THE MATTER WITH YOU
HE STARED INTO SPACE TO THE TWO WATCHERS THERE WAS A CURIOUS AND PROFOUND DIGNITY IN THE FIRM LINES OF HIS AWFUL FACE HE WAS INVADED BY A CREEPING STRANGENESS THAT SLOWLY ENVELOPED HIM
KARMU WAS A FARMER AND DHARMU WAS A TRADER ONCE WHEN DHARMU WAS AWAY FROM HOME KARMU GAVE A RELIGIOUS FEAST AND DID NOT INVITE DHARMU'S HOUSEHOLD WHEN DHARMU RETURNED AND LEARNT THIS
HIS FACE WAS SO DRY AND GRIMY THAT HE THOUGHT HE COULD FEEL HIS SKIN CRACKLE EACH BONE OF HIS BODY HAD AN ACHE IN IT AND SEEMINGLY THREATENED TO BREAK WITH EACH MOVEMENT HIS FEET WERE LIKE TWO SORES
AND THE BUFFALO SAID GO ON TO THE BANK OF THE GANGES THEN THEY CAME TO A HORSE AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD CATCH IT AND MOUNT IT BUT IT KICKED AND SNORTED AND THEY SANG
STANDING BEFORE A CRIMSON AND STEEL ASSAULT GETTING CALMLY KILLED ON A HIGH PLACE BEFORE THE EYES OF ALL HE THOUGHT OF THE MAGNIFICENT PATHOS OF HIS DEAD BODY THESE THOUGHTS UPLIFTED HIM
THE YOUTH WISHED HIS FRIEND TO LEAN UPON HIM BUT THE OTHER ALWAYS SHOOK HIS HEAD AND STRANGELY PROTESTED NO NO NO LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE HIS LOOK WAS FIXED AGAIN UPON THE UNKNOWN
HE CALLED BOTH LYMAN CASS THE MILLER AND THE FINN HOMESTEADER FROM LOST LAKE BY THEIR FIRST NAMES HE WAS KNOWN AS THE RED SWEDE AND CONSIDERED SLIGHTLY INSANE BJORNSTAM COULD DO ANYTHING WITH HIS HANDS SOLDER A PAN
DISLOYAL NON PATRIOTIC PRO GERMAN PACIFISTS THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DID THIS ORGANIZER SAY ANYTHING PRO GERMAN NOT ON YOUR LIFE THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM A CHANCE HIS LAUGH WAS STAGEY

AND EVERYWHERE WAS A RHYTHMIC SOUND OF WOOD SAWING IT WAS SATURDAY AND THE NEIGHBORS SONS WERE GETTING UP THE WINTER FUEL BEHIND WALLS OF CORDED WOOD IN BACK YARDS THEIR SAWBUCKS STOOD IN DEPRESSIONS SCATTERED WITH CANARY YELLOW FLAKES OF SAWDUST
BUT SOLITARY DISH WASHING ISN'T ENOUGH TO SATISFY ME OR MANY OTHER WOMEN WE'RE GOING TO CHUCK IT WE'RE GOING TO WASH EM BY MACHINERY AND COME OUT AND PLAY WITH YOU MEN IN THE OFFICES AND CLUBS AND POLITICS YOU'VE CLEVERLY KEPT FOR YOURSELVES
STORM SHEDS WERE ERECTED AT EVERY DOOR IN EVERY BLOCK THE HOUSEHOLDERS SAM CLARK THE WEALTHY MISTER DAWSON ALL SAVE ASTHMATIC EZRA STOWBODY WHO EXTRAVAGANTLY HIRED A BOY
WHICH MADE THE REARING OF CITIZENS MORE COSTLY AND PERILOUS THAN ANY OTHER CRIME IT WAS INADVISABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN TILL HE HAD MADE MORE MONEY SHE WAS SORRY PERHAPS HE HAD MADE ALL THE MYSTERY OF LOVE A MECHANICAL CAUTIOUSNESS BUT
CANVAS JACKETS LINED WITH FLUFFY YELLOW WOOL LIKE THE PLUMAGE OF DUCKLINGS MOCCASINS RED FLANNEL WRISTLETS FOR THE BLAZING CHAPPED WRISTS OF BOYS THESE PROTECTIONS AGAINST WINTER WERE BUSILY DUG OUT OF MOTH BALL SPRINKLED DRAWERS

NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT COMPLICATION DID YOU IN THIS OFF TO BOHEMIA AND EXPRESS YOURSELF AND FREE LOVE AND LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE STUFF YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO ME IF YOU CAN KEEP ME CAN YOU HE MOVED UNEASILY
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX KENNICOTT WAS NOT SO INHUMANLY PATIENT THAT HE COULD CONTINUE TO FORGIVE CAROL'S HERESIES TO WOO HER AS HE HAD ON THE VENTURE TO CALIFORNIA SHE TRIED TO BE INCONSPICUOUS
SHE BEGAN TO THINK WITH UNPLEASANT LUCIDITY SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE PEOPLE LIKED HER SHE HAD GONE TO THE WOMEN AT AFTERNOON COFFEES TO THE MERCHANTS IN THEIR STORES WITH SO MANY OUTPOURING COMMENTS AND WHIMSIES
SHE SWORE IT WITH SOFT FIST BEATING THE EDGES OF THE RADIATOR AND AT THE END OF ALL HER VOWS SHE HAD NO NOTION AS TO WHEN AND WHERE THE CRUSADE WAS TO BEGIN BECOME AN AUTHENTIC PART OF THE TOWN
AND ANNOUNCED THAT IN A FEW DAYS HE WOULD ADDRESS A FARMERS POLITICAL MEETING THAT NIGHT THE NEWS RAN A MOB OF A HUNDRED BUSINESS MEN LED BY THE SHERIFF THE TAME VILLAGE STREET AND THE SMUG VILLAGE FACES RUDDLED BY THE LIGHT OF BOBBING LANTERNS
BUT WAS I MORE HAPPY WHEN I WAS DRUDGING I WAS NOT I WAS JUST BEDRAGGLED AND UNHAPPY IT'S WORK BUT NOT MY WORK I COULD RUN AN OFFICE OR A LIBRARY OR NURSE AND TEACH CHILDREN
THESE BUSINESS MEN FROM THEIR CRUSHING LABORS OF SITTING IN AN OFFICE SEVEN HOURS A DAY WOULD CALMLY RECOMMEND THAT I HAVE A DOZEN CHILDREN AS IT HAPPENS I'VE DONE THAT SORT OF THING
WHETHER IT'S BUSINESS COMPETITION OR BAD MUSIC IF WE WERE FIGHTING ENGLAND YOU'D CALL THE RADICALS PRO ENGLISH WHEN THIS WAR IS OVER I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE CALLING THEM RED ANARCHISTS WHAT AN ETERNAL ART IT IS SUCH A GLITTERY DELIGHTFUL ART
THAT THEY REDISCOVERED WITH SURPRISE AND A FEELING OF HEROISM THIS ARMOR OF AN ARTIC EXPLORER WINTER GARMENTS SURPASSED EVEN PERSONAL GOSSIP AS THE TOPIC AT PARTIES IT WAS GOOD FORM TO ASK PUT ON YOUR HEAVIES YET
THEY SAY THERE'S A CHANCE WE MAY GET ANOTHER FACTORY CREAM SEPARATOR WORKS HE ADDED YOU MIGHT TRY TO LOOK INTERESTED EVEN IF YOU AIN'T THE BABY WAS FRIGHTENED BY THE JOVIAN ROAR RAN WAILING TO HIDE HIS FACE IN CAROL'S LAP
THERE WERE ONLY THREE THINGS WHICH SHE COULD DO HAVE CHILDREN START HER CAREER OF REFORMING OR BECOME SO DEFINITELY A PART OF THE TOWN THAT SHE WOULD BE FULFILLED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF CHURCH AND STUDY CLUB AND BRIDGE PARTIES
AND WHEN HE WAS LOST SHE WANTED TO LEAP FROM THE VESTIBULE AND RUN BACK TO HIM SHE THOUGHT OF A HUNDRED TENDERNESSES SHE HAD NEGLECTED SHE HAD HER FREEDOM AND IT WAS EMPTY THE MOMENT WAS NOT THE HIGHEST OF HER LIFE BUT THE LOWEST AND MOST DESOLATE
NO IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT I THINK IT'S A GREATNESS OF LIFE A REFUSAL TO BE CONTENT WITH EVEN THE HEALTHIEST MUD DON'T YOU KNOW THAT NOBODY EVER SOLVED A PROBLEM BY RUNNING AWAY FROM IT PERHAPS
FINDING HARD NAMES FOR OUR OPPONENTS HOW WE DO SANCTIFY OUR EFFORTS TO KEEP THEM FROM GETTING THE HOLY DOLLARS WE WANT FOR OURSELVES THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT AND THE POLITICAL ORATORS AND I SUPPOSE I DO IT WHEN I CALL MISSUS BOGART A PURITAN
AND A WHITE AND GREEN HOUSE FILLED WITH BOOKS AND SILVER TEA SETS AND COOKIES COOKIES OH MOST DECIDEDLY COOKIES WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BREAD AND PORRIDGE
SHE COULDN'T SATISFY HER INGENUITY IN PLANNING MEALS AT DAHL AND OLESON'S MEAT MARKET YOU DIDN'T GIVE ORDERS YOU WOFULLY INQUIRED WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING TODAY BESIDES STEAK AND PORK AND HAM THE CUTS OF BEEF WERE NOT CUTS THEY WERE HACKS
WHICH HE HELD IN HIS MOUTH LIKE AN EXTRAORDINARY SET OF EXTERNAL FALSE TEETH THE UNIVERSAL SIGN OF WINTER WAS THE TOWN HANDYMAN MILES BJORNSTAM A TALL THICK RED MUSTACHED BACHELOR OPINIONATED ATHEIST GENERAL STORE ARGUER
SO THE WHOLE THING WAS ILLEGAL AND LED BY THE SHERIFF PRECISELY HOW DO YOU EXPECT THESE ALIENS TO OBEY YOUR LAW IF THE OFFICER OF THE LAW TEACHES THEM TO BREAK IT IS IT A NEW KIND OF LOGIC
ONLY I CHOOSE TO MAKE MY OWN DEFINITION OF RUNNING AWAY I DON'T CALL DO YOU REALIZE HOW BIG A WORLD THERE IS BEYOND THIS GOPHER PRAIRIE WHERE YOU'D KEEP ME ALL MY LIFE IT MAY BE THAT SOME DAY I'LL COME BACK BUT NOT TILL I CAN BRING SOMETHING MORE THAN I HAVE NOW
IT WAS SO RICH LOOKING TO SIT AND DRIVE AND SO EASY SKIING AND SLIDING WERE STUPID AND OLD FASHIONED IN FACT THE VILLAGE LONGED FOR THE ELEGANCE OF CITY RECREATIONS ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE CITIES LONGED FOR VILLAGE SPORTS
CYNICAL SANTA CLAUS CHILDREN LOVED HIM AND HE SNEAKED AWAY FROM WORK TO TELL THEM IMPROBABLE STORIES OF SEA FARING AND HORSE TRADING AND BEARS THE CHILDREN'S PARENTS EITHER LAUGHED AT HIM OR HATED HIM HE WAS THE ONE DEMOCRAT IN TOWN
MISSUS KENNICOTT CONFIDED TO YE SCRIBE THAT SHE WILL BE CONNECTED WITH ONE OF THE MULTIFARIOUS WAR ACTIVITIES NOW CENTERING IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL FOR A BRIEF PERIOD BEFORE RETURNING HER COUNTLESS FRIENDS WHO APPRECIATE HER SPLENDID LABORS WITH THE LOCAL RED CROSS
AND KENNICOTT HAD TO MAKE HIMSELF HUMBLE AND COURT BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD THE DIM INJUSTICE OF NOT BEING UNDERSTOOD EVEN BY HIS SON LEFT HIM IRRITABLE HE FELT INJURED AN EVENT WHICH DID NOT DIRECTLY TOUCH THEM BROUGHT DOWN HIS WRATH
AND TAR BAGS IN CLOSETS AND ALL OVER TOWN SMALL BOYS WERE SQUEALING OH THERE'S MY MITTENS OR LOOK AT MY SHOE PACKS THERE IS SO SHARP A DIVISION BETWEEN THE PANTING SUMMER AND THE STINGING WINTER OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS
AND SEE WHAT THE EAST WAS LIKE IN WARTIME SHE SET OUT FOR WASHINGTON IN OCTOBER JUST BEFORE THE WAR ENDED SHE HAD DETERMINED ON WASHINGTON BECAUSE IT WAS LESS INTIMIDATING THAN THE OBVIOUS NEW YORK BECAUSE SHE HOPED TO FIND STREETS IN WHICH HUGH COULD PLAY
THE FRAMES OF THEIR BUCK SAWS WERE CHERRY RED THE BLADES BLUED STEEL AND THE FRESH CUT ENDS OF THE STICKS POPLAR MAPLE IRON WOOD BIRCH WERE MARKED WITH ENGRAVED RINGS OF GROWTH
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM WITH ME SUPPOSE I REFUSE YOU WON'T FORLORNLY UH CARRIE WHAT THE DEVIL IS IT YOU WANT ANYWAY OH CONVERSATION
LAMB CHOPS WERE AS EXOTIC AS SHARKS FINS THE MEAT DEALERS SHIPPED THEIR BEST TO THE CITY WITH ITS HIGHER PRICES IN ALL THE SHOPS THERE WAS THE SAME LACK OF CHOICE SHE COULD NOT FIND A GLASS HEADED PICTURE NAIL IN TOWN
THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE SO DISCONTENTED I KNOW THAT'S WHAT MOST MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU WOULD SAY THAT'S HOW THEY WOULD EXPLAIN ALL I AM AND ALL I WANT AND I SHOULDN'T ARGUE WITH THEM
HE WAS A SERIOUS AND LITERAL PERSON AND RATHER HUMORLESS SHE KISSED HIS FROWN AND MARVELED I AM RUNNING AWAY FROM MY HUSBAND AFTER LIKING A SWEDISH NE'ER DO WELL AND EXPRESSING IMMORAL OPINIONS JUST AS IN A ROMANTIC STORY
HER COLLAR WHITE WITH FROST FROM HER BREATH SHE BOUGHT A CAN OF TOMATOES AS THOUGH IT WERE ORIENT FRUIT AND RETURNED HOME PLANNING TO SURPRISE KENNICOTT WITH AN OMELET CREOLE FOR DINNER SO BRILLIANT WAS THE SNOW GLARE
FLATLY WE'RE GOING TO FIND ELEPHANTS WITH GOLDEN HOWDAHS FROM WHICH PEEP YOUNG MAHARANEES WITH NECKLACES OF RUBIES AND A DAWN SEA COLORED LIKE THE BREAST OF A DOVE
WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER EXCELLENT FOR INSTEAD OF SLIPPING DOWNWARD SHE BEGAN TO CLIMB SHE SIGHED I COULDN'T DO THIS IF IT WEREN'T FOR WILL'S KINDNESS HIS GIVING ME MONEY BUT A SECOND AFTER
THAT SHE HADN'T GIVEN THEM A CHANCE TO BETRAY THEIR OPINIONS OF HER THE MEN SMILED BUT DID THEY LIKE HER SHE WAS LIVELY AMONG THE WOMEN BUT WAS SHE ONE OF THEM
THE BOYS WORE SHOE PACKS BLUE FLANNEL SHIRTS WITH ENORMOUS PEARL BUTTONS AND MACKINAWS OF CRIMSON LEMON YELLOW AND FOXY BROWN CAROL CRIED FINE DAY TO THE BOYS SHE CAME IN A GLOW TO HOWLAND AND GOULD'S GROCERY
AND THEY'D HAVE ANOTHER SKIING EXPEDITION RIGHT AWAY AND THEY JOLLILY RETURNED HOME AND NEVER THEREAFTER LEFT THEIR MANUALS OF BRIDGE CAROL WAS DISCOURAGED SHE WAS GRATEFUL WHEN KENNICOTT INVITED HER TO GO RABBIT HUNTING IN THE WOODS
GOPHER PRAIRIE IS LOST BACK THERE IN THE DUST AND STUBBLE AND I LOOK FORWARD SHE CONTINUED IT TO HUGH DARLING DO YOU KNOW WHAT MOTHER AND YOU ARE GOING TO FIND BEYOND THE BLUE HORIZON RIM WHAT
THE POORER HOUSES OF GOPHER PRAIRIE WHERE THE SERVICES OF MILES BJORNSTAM WERE A LUXURY WHICH INCLUDED THE SHANTY OF MILES BJORNSTAM WERE BANKED TO THE LOWER WINDOWS WITH EARTH AND MANURE
AND IF I HAD MY WAY I'D MAKE YOU FOLKS LIVE UP TO THE ESTABLISHED RULES OF DECENCY EVEN IF I HAD TO TAKE YOU WILL SHE WAS NOT TIMOROUS NOW AM I PRO GERMAN IF I FAIL TO THROB TO HONEST JIM BLAUSSER TOO
BUT WHEN SNOW HAD ENDED THE SKATING AND SHE TRIED TO GET UP A MOONLIGHT SLIDING PARTY THE MATRONS HESITATED TO STIR AWAY FROM THEIR RADIATORS AND THEIR DAILY BRIDGE WHIST IMITATIONS OF THE CITY SHE HAD TO NAG THEM THEY SCOOTED DOWN A LONG HILL ON A BOB SLED
OH PLEASE WAIT TILL MY GENERATION HAS STOPPED REBELLING BEFORE YOURS STARTS IN WHAT'S A GENERATION IT'S A RAY IN THE ILLUMINATION OF THE SPIRIT THAT'S FOOLISH
HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON BESIDES THE REPAIRMAN AT SAM CLARK'S WHO UNDERSTOOD PLUMBING EVERYBODY BEGGED HIM TO LOOK OVER THE FURNACE AND THE WATER PIPES HE RUSHED FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE TILL AFTER BEDTIME TEN O'CLOCK
AND GOPHER PRAIRIE TOOK AS MUCH PRIDE IN NEGLECTING COASTING AS SAINT PAUL OR NEW YORK IN GOING COASTING CAROL DID INSPIRE A SUCCESSFUL SKATING PARTY IN MID NOVEMBER
THERE WERE AS MANY DISTINCTIONS IN WRAPS AS IN MOTOR CARS THE LESSER SORT APPEARED IN YELLOW AND BLACK DOGSKIN COATS BUT KENNICOTT WAS LORDLY IN A LONG RACCOON ULSTER AND A NEW SEAL CAP WHEN THE SNOW WAS TOO DEEP FOR HIS MOTOR
DO YOU MIND TELLING ME IF IT ISN'T TOO MUCH TROUBLE HOW LONG YOU'RE GOING FOR I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS FOR A YEAR PERHAPS FOR A LIFETIME I SEE WELL OF COURSE I'LL BE TICKLED TO DEATH TO SELL OUT MY PRACTISE AND GO ANYWHERE YOU SAY
HER LIVELIEST ACTIVITY NOW WAS ORGANIZING OUTDOOR SPORTS IN THE MOTOR PARALYZED TOWN THE AUTOMOBILE AND BRIDGE WHIST HAD NOT ONLY MADE MORE EVIDENT THE SOCIAL DIVISIONS IN GOPHER PRAIRIE BUT THEY HAD ALSO ENFEEBLED THE LOVE OF ACTIVITY
THUS SHE CHANCED TO DISCOVER THAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO
THEY UPSET AND GOT SNOW DOWN THEIR NECKS THEY SHRIEKED THAT THEY WOULD DO IT AGAIN IMMEDIATELY AND THEY DID NOT DO IT AGAIN AT ALL SHE BADGERED ANOTHER GROUP INTO GOING SKIING THEY SHOUTED AND THREW SNOWBALLS
BUT ONE THING I'M NOT GOING TO STAND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND MY OWN WIFE BEING SEDITIOUS YOU CAN CAMOUFLAGE ALL YOU WANT TO BUT YOU KNOW DARN WELL THAT THESE RADICALS AS YOU CALL EM ARE OPPOSED TO THE WAR AND LET ME TELL YOU RIGHT HERE AND NOW
IN THE MID AFTERNOON OF THIS SAME DAY KENNICOTT WAS CALLED INTO THE COUNTRY IT WAS BEA'S EVENING OUT HER EVENING FOR THE LUTHERAN DANCE CAROL WAS ALONE FROM THREE TILL MIDNIGHT
ALONG THE RAILROAD THE SECTIONS OF SNOW FENCE WHICH HAD BEEN STACKED ALL SUMMER IN ROMANTIC WOODEN TENTS OCCUPIED BY ROVING SMALL BOYS WERE SET UP TO PREVENT DRIFTS FROM COVERING THE TRACK
LET'S HAVE MY WHOLE DUTY AS A WIFE HE WAS GRUMBLING THE WHOLE THING'S RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE CRITICISM YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN MAKING MIGHT HAVE KNOWN YOU'D OPPOSE ANY DECENT CONSTRUCTIVE WORK FOR THE TOWN OR FOR YOU'RE RIGHT ALL I'VE DONE HAS BEEN IN LINE
AND NOW I EXPECT YOU TO PLAY THE GAME
THERE'VE BEEN A GOOD MANY TIMES WHEN WE HADN'T A MAID AND I DID ALL THE HOUSEWORK AND CARED FOR HUGH AND WENT TO RED CROSS AND DID IT ALL VERY EFFICIENTLY I'M A GOOD COOK AND A GOOD SWEEPER
WERE SEEN PERILOUSLY STAGGERING UP LADDERS CARRYING STORM WINDOWS AND SCREWING THEM TO SECOND STORY JAMBS WHILE KENNICOTT PUT UP HIS WINDOWS CAROL DANCED INSIDE THE BEDROOMS AND BEGGED HIM NOT TO SWALLOW THE SCREWS
HE CHEWED THE STUB OF A CIGAR BUT HE WAS COURTLY TO CAROL HE STOOPED TO EXAMINE THE FURNACE FLUES HE STRAIGHTENED GLANCED DOWN AT HER AND HEMMED GOT TO FIX YOUR FURNACE NO MATTER WHAT ELSE I DO
WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ANY TOWN OF ANYWHERES NEAR OUR SIZE IN THE STATE THAT HAS SUCH A STERLING WAR RECORD ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU'D BETTER WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW
WHY YOU SAY HE'S A ROUGHNECK AND YOU WON'T JUMP ON THE BAND WAGON ONCE WHEN KENNICOTT ANNOUNCED AT NOON DINNER
AND ALONE I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT MY WORK IS WORK WORK SURE THAT'S THE WHOLE TROUBLE WITH YOU YOU HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH WORK TO DO IF YOU HAD FIVE KIDS AND NO HIRED GIRL
I DON'T BELONG TO GOPHER PRAIRIE THAT ISN'T MEANT AS A CONDEMNATION OF GOPHER PRAIRIE AND IT MAY BE A CONDEMNATION OF ME ALL RIGHT I DON'T CARE I DON'T BELONG HERE AND I'M GOING I'M NOT ASKING PERMISSION ANY MORE I'M SIMPLY GOING HE GRUNTED
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME GO WITH YOU TO PARIS AND STUDY ART MAYBE AND WEAR VELVETEEN PANTS AND A WOMAN'S BONNET AND LIVE ON SPAGHETTI NO I THINK WE CAN SAVE YOU THAT TROUBLE YOU DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND I AM GOING I REALLY AM
THROUGH LATE NOVEMBER AND ALL DECEMBER IT SNOWED DAILY THE THERMOMETER WAS AT ZERO AND MIGHT DROP TO TWENTY BELOW OR THIRTY WINTER IS NOT A SEASON IN THE NORTH MIDDLEWEST IT IS AN INDUSTRY
BUT SHE WAS BETRAYED BY HER FAILURE TO GLOW OVER THE BOOSTING KENNICOTT BELIEVED IN IT DEMANDED THAT SHE SAY PATRIOTIC THINGS ABOUT THE WHITE WAY AND THE NEW FACTORY HE SNORTED BY GOLLY I'VE DONE ALL I COULD
CHILDREN YES SHE WANTED THEM BUT SHE WAS NOT QUITE READY SHE HAD BEEN EMBARRASSED BY KENNICOTT'S FRANKNESS BUT SHE AGREED WITH HIM THAT IN THE INSANE CONDITION OF CIVILIZATION
SHE FLED FROM THE THOUGHT WITH A DUBIOUS SOME DAY HER REFORMS HER IMPULSES TOWARD BEAUTY IN RAW MAIN STREET THEY HAD BECOME INDISTINCT BUT SHE WOULD SET THEM GOING NOW SHE WOULD
SHE DID NOT HUNT FOR THE SORT OF VEILING SHE WANTED SHE TOOK WHAT SHE COULD GET AND ONLY AT HOWLAND AND GOULD'S WAS THERE SUCH A LUXURY AS CANNED ASPARAGUS ROUTINE CARE WAS ALL SHE COULD DEVOTE TO THE HOUSE
SHE HAD SHE MEDITATED PASSED THROUGH THE NOVELTY OF SEEING THE TOWN AND MEETING PEOPLE OF SKATING AND SLIDING AND HUNTING BEA WAS COMPETENT THERE WAS NO HOUSEHOLD LABOR EXCEPT SEWING AND DARNING AND GOSSIPY ASSISTANCE TO BEA IN BED MAKING
OH WE'RE HOPELESS WE DISSATISFIED WOMEN THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE US ABOUT THE PLACE TO FRET YOU SO IT'S FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I'M GOING OF COURSE A LITTLE THING LIKE HUGH MAKES NO DIFFERENCE YES ALL THE DIFFERENCE
FOR A MONTH THEY DISCUSSED IT THEY HURT EACH OTHER VERY MUCH AND SOMETIMES THEY WERE CLOSE TO WEEPING AND INVARIABLY HE USED BANAL PHRASES ABOUT HER DUTIES AND SHE USED PHRASES QUITE AS BANAL ABOUT FREEDOM AND THROUGH IT ALL
RINGING TO THE SKATES ON SHORE THE ICE TIPPED REEDS CLATTERED IN THE WIND AND OAK TWIGS WITH STUBBORN LAST LEAVES HUNG AGAINST A MILKY SKY HARRY HAYDOCK DID FIGURE EIGHTS AND CAROL WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE PERFECT LIFE
BUT IF YOU GO DEFENDING THESE FELLOWS THEN THE SAME THING APPLIES TO YOU NEXT THING I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE YAPPING ABOUT FREE SPEECH FREE SPEECH THERE'S TOO MUCH FREE SPEECH AND FREE GAS AND FREE BEER AND FREE LOVE
THE LAST THING SHE SAW ON THE STATION PLATFORM WAS KENNICOTT FAITHFULLY WAVING HIS HAND HIS FACE SO FULL OF UNCOMPREHENDING LONELINESS THAT HE COULD NOT SMILE BUT ONLY TWITCH UP HIS LIPS SHE WAVED TO HIM AS LONG AS SHE COULD
DECLARED SAM AND KENNICOTT AND DAVE DYER JOINED IN A PROUD YOU BET CAROL WALKED OUT HASTILY KENNICOTT OBSERVING HER THROUGH SUPPER TIME SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS BUBBLING AND WOULD SOON BOIL OVER
THAT'LL BE ABOUT ALL FROM YOU I'VE STOOD FOR YOUR SNEERING AT THIS TOWN AND SAYING HOW UGLY AND DULL IT IS I'VE STOOD FOR YOUR REFUSING TO APPRECIATE GOOD FELLOWS LIKE SAM I'VE EVEN STOOD FOR YOUR RIDICULING OUR WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW CAMPAIGN
ICICLES FROM BURST WATER PIPES HUNG ALONG THE SKIRT OF HIS BROWN DOG SKIN OVERCOAT HIS PLUSH CAP WHICH HE NEVER TOOK OFF IN THE HOUSE WAS A PULP OF ICE AND COAL DUST HIS RED HANDS WERE CRACKED TO RAWNESS
AND BECAUSE IN THE STRESS OF WAR WORK WITH ITS DEMAND FOR THOUSANDS OF TEMPORARY CLERKS SHE COULD BE INITIATED INTO THE WORLD OF OFFICES HUGH WAS TO GO WITH HER DESPITE THE WAILS AND RATHER EXTENSIVE COMMENTS OF AUNT BESSIE
MAYBE IT WASN'T EXACTLY REGULAR BUT WHAT'S THE ODDS THEY KNEW THIS FELLOW WOULD TRY TO STIR UP TROUBLE WHENEVER IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO A QUESTION OF DEFENDING AMERICANISM AND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IT'S JUSTIFIABLE TO SET ASIDE ORDINARY PROCEDURE
WASN'T SAM RATHER NEEDLESSLY HEROIC ALL THESE ORGANIZERS YES
ONLY BY SUCH FUSSING AS THE WIDOW BOGART'S COULD SHE MAKE IT FILL HER TIME SHE COULD NOT HAVE OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT TO THE VILLAGE DOCTOR'S WIFE IT WAS TABOO SHE WAS A WOMAN WITH A WORKING BRAIN AND NO WORK
THAT WHEN SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE SHE SAW THE DOOR KNOBS THE NEWSPAPER ON THE TABLE EVERY WHITE SURFACE AS DAZZLING MAUVE AND HER HEAD WAS DIZZY IN THE PYROTECHNIC DIMNESS WHEN HER EYES HAD RECOVERED SHE FELT EXPANDED DRUNK WITH HEALTH MISTRESS OF LIFE
SHE WADED DOWN STILLY CLOISTERS BETWEEN BURNT STUMP AND ICY OAK THROUGH DRIFTS MARKED WITH A MILLION HIEROGLYPHICS OF RABBIT AND MOUSE AND BIRD SHE SQUEALED AS HE LEAPED ON A PILE OF BRUSH AND FIRED AT THE RABBIT WHICH RAN OUT HE BELONGED THERE
AND YOU AND ALL THESE LONG HAIRED MEN AND SHORT HAIRED WOMEN CAN BEEF ALL YOU WANT TO BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THESE FELLOWS AND IF THEY AIN'T PATRIOTIC WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM BE PATRIOTIC AND LORD KNOWS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO SAY THIS TO MY OWN WIFE
I HAVE HAD A FEARFUL SLEEP IT SEEMED AS THOUGH MY SOUL WERE ALREADY HOVERING OVER MY BODY MY EYES WHICH I TRIED TO OPEN CLOSED AGAINST MY WILL AND WHAT WILL APPEAR IMPOSSIBLE ABOVE ALL TO YOU SIR I SAW
JUST AS HE WAS HIS MIND PERFECTLY CLEAR BUT THE SAME INCAPABILITY OF MOVING OR SPEAKING
AND VALENTINE KNEW HOW THE HAUGHTY MARQUISE DE SAINT MERAN DESPISED ALL WHO WERE NOT NOBLE HER SECRET HAD EACH TIME BEEN REPRESSED
THAT ALL OUR PROPERTY RETURNS TO VALENTINE AH GRANDMAMMA MURMURED VALENTINE PRESSING HER LIPS ON THE BURNING BROW DO YOU WISH TO KILL ME OH HOW FEVERISH YOU ARE WE MUST NOT SEND FOR A NOTARY BUT FOR A DOCTOR
OH MY POOR MOTHER SAID VILLEFORT TO HAVE SUCH DUTIES TO PERFORM AT YOUR AGE AFTER SUCH A BLOW GOD HAS SUPPORTED ME THROUGH ALL AND THEN
WHICH APPEARED SUDDENLY IN LETTERS OF BLOOD UPON THE WALL BUT WHAT HE WAS REALLY ANXIOUS FOR WAS TO DISCOVER WHOSE HAND HAD TRACED THEM WHILE HE WAS ENDEAVORING TO CALM HIS FEARS
AND WHAT DID YOU DO THEN
THEIR NUMBER WAS FORMIDABLE NOW THAT HE HAD BEGUN TO FEAR AND YET THESE NAMES POWERFUL THOUGH THEY WERE HAD OFTEN CAUSED HIM TO SMILE WITH THE SAME KIND OF SATISFACTION EXPERIENCED BY A TRAVELLER WHO
YES MADAME IS HE NOT THE SON OF GENERAL D'EPINAY WHO WAS ON OUR SIDE AND WHO WAS ASSASSINATED SOME DAYS BEFORE THE USURPER RETURNED FROM THE ISLAND OF ELBA THE SAME
AND THAT THE VEINS OF HIS TEMPLES THROBBED MORE VIOLENTLY THAN USUAL HOWEVER AS IT BECAME DARK AND I COULD NO LONGER SEE I FELL ASLEEP I WAS SOON AROUSED BY A PIERCING SHRIEK
OF ONLY ONE OF MY SENSES I HEARD MY GLASS REMOVED THE SAME WHICH IS THERE NOW ON THE TABLE OH DEAR MOTHER IT WAS A DREAM SO LITTLE WAS IT A DREAM THAT I STRETCHED MY HAND TOWARDS THE BELL
AND GRANDPAPA
AND VALENTINE SEATED HERSELF AT THE BEDSIDE OF HER GRANDMOTHER THE POOR CHILD APPEARED HERSELF TO REQUIRE THE DOCTOR SHE HAD RECOMMENDED TO HER AGED RELATIVE A BRIGHT SPOT BURNED IN EITHER CHEEK HER RESPIRATION WAS SHORT
GIVE IT TO ME VALENTINE VALENTINE POURED THE ORANGEADE INTO A GLASS AND GAVE IT TO HER GRANDMOTHER WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF DREAD FOR IT WAS THE SAME GLASS SHE FANCIED THAT HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THE SPECTRE
ALMOST TO A MIRACULOUS EXTENT FOR HE WAS ONE OF THE PHYSICIANS WHO ALWAYS WORK UPON THE BODY THROUGH THE MIND NO SHE REPLIED IT IS FOR MY POOR GRANDMOTHER YOU KNOW THE CALAMITY THAT HAS HAPPENED TO US DO YOU NOT
AND INSTEAD OF DWELLING UPON THE POLITICAL FUTURE THAT HAD SO OFTEN BEEN THE SUBJECT OF HIS AMBITIOUS DREAMS WAS IMAGINING A FUTURE LIMITED TO THE ENJOYMENTS OF HOME IN FEAR OF AWAKENING THE ENEMY THAT HAD SO LONG SLEPT
I BESEECH YOU DO SOMETHING FOR HER WHERE IS SHE IN HER ROOM WITH THE NOTARY
A DOCTOR SAID SHE SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS I AM NOT ILL I AM THIRSTY THAT IS ALL WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING DEAR GRANDMAMMA THE SAME AS USUAL MY DEAR MY GLASS IS THERE ON THE TABLE
VALENTINE DURST NOT OPPOSE HER GRANDMOTHER'S WISH THE CAUSE OF WHICH SHE DID NOT KNOW AND AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS VILLEFORT ENTERED
THEN HE CLOSED ONE EYE IN TOKEN OF INQUIRY MADEMOISELLE VALENTINE NOIRTIER NODDED HIS HEAD SHE IS AT THE BALL AS YOU KNOW
AND THE NOTARY HAD ARRIVED THOUGH HIS COMING WAS ANNOUNCED IN A VERY LOW TONE MADAME DE SAINT MERAN AROSE FROM HER PILLOW THE NOTARY SHE EXCLAIMED LET HIM COME IN
SHE FANCIED THIS MORNING IN HER SLEEP THAT HER SOUL WAS HOVERING ABOVE HER BODY WHICH SHE AT THE SAME TIME WATCHED IT MUST HAVE BEEN DELIRIUM SHE FANCIES TOO THAT SHE SAW A PHANTOM ENTER HER CHAMBER
WHERE SHE BURIED HER VENERABLE HEAD VILLEFORT LEFT HER TO THE CARE OF THE WOMEN WHILE OLD BARROIS RAN HALF SCARED TO HIS MASTER FOR NOTHING FRIGHTENS OLD PEOPLE SO MUCH
BUT LIKE A PHOSPHORIC LIGHT THEY RISE BUT TO MISLEAD THE STORY HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE CORSICAN TO SOME PRIEST WHO IN HIS TURN HAS REPEATED IT
AMONGST WHICH HE HAD CAREFULLY ARRANGED IN CHARACTERS ONLY KNOWN TO HIMSELF THE NAMES OF ALL THOSE WHO EITHER IN HIS POLITICAL CAREER IN MONEY MATTERS AT THE BAR OR IN HIS MYSTERIOUS LOVE AFFAIRS HAD BECOME HIS ENEMIES
YES SAID VALENTINE HE WAS VERY FOND OF ME WHO DOES NOT LOVE YOU VALENTINE SMILED SADLY WHAT ARE YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S SYMPTOMS AN EXTREME NERVOUS EXCITEMENT AND A STRANGELY AGITATED SLEEP
ON THE CONTRARY HER EYES GLISTENED AND SHE APPEARED TO BE SUFFERING FROM VIOLENT NERVOUS IRRITABILITY OH DEAR GRANDMAMMA ARE YOU WORSE EXCLAIMED VALENTINE PERCEIVING ALL THESE SIGNS OF AGITATION
WHEN HE HAD RUN OVER ALL THESE NAMES IN HIS MEMORY AGAIN READ AND STUDIED THEM COMMENTING MEANWHILE UPON HIS LISTS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO HE MURMURED
WHO COULD HAVE THOUGHT IT AH YES IT IS INDEED STRANGE AND THE WRETCHED FAMILY DEPARTED LEAVING A CLOUD OF SADNESS HANGING OVER THE REST OF THE EVENING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS VALENTINE FOUND BARROIS AWAITING HER
AND WITH THE DOOR LOCKED AND ORDERS GIVEN THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE DISTURBED EXCEPTING FOR IMPORTANT BUSINESS HE SAT DOWN IN HIS ARM CHAIR AND BEGAN TO PONDER OVER THE EVENTS THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHICH HAD DURING THE LAST EIGHT DAYS
THOUGH SHE HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO PUT ON THE OUTWARD SEMBLANCE OF WOE SHE THEN TURNED TOWARDS THE AVENUE AS SHE ADVANCED SHE FANCIED SHE HEARD A VOICE SPEAKING HER NAME SHE STOPPED ASTONISHED
THE WHITE HAIR WAS THROWN BACK FROM HER YELLOW FOREHEAD AND HER EYES ALREADY SUNKEN BY THE FURROWS OF AGE NOW ALMOST DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE EYELIDS SWOLLEN WITH GRIEF OH SIR SHE SAID OH SIR
WHOM YOU HAVE SO SOON FORGOTTEN SIR AH MADAME SAID VILLEFORT YOU FORGET THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE A MOTHER TO MY CHILD A STEPMOTHER IS NEVER A MOTHER SIR BUT THIS IS NOT TO THE PURPOSE
WE WENT OUT TOGETHER IN THE CARRIAGE AFTER DINNER
THAT DETER WEAK MINDS FROM PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE I ALSO WAS MARRIED AT THE DEATH BED OF MY MOTHER AND CERTAINLY I HAVE NOT BEEN LESS HAPPY ON THAT ACCOUNT STILL THAT IDEA OF DEATH MADAME SAID VILLEFORT STILL
WITHOUT THAT WHAT WOULD BECOME OF ME IT WAS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BARROIS WHO WISHED TO GO TO BED HIMSELF OBSERVED THAT AFTER SUCH SAD EVENTS EVERY ONE STOOD IN NEED OF REST NOIRTIER WOULD NOT SAY
SON OF A SHIPOWNER OF MALTA DISCOVERER OF A MINE IN THESSALY NOW VISITING PARIS FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT INTEREST I SAY CAN HE TAKE IN DISCOVERING A GLOOMY MYSTERIOUS AND USELESS FACT LIKE THIS HOWEVER
HAD FOLLOWED HIS WIFE MEANWHILE BARROIS HAD RETURNED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO OLD NOIRTIER WHO HAVING HEARD THE NOISE IN THE HOUSE HAD AS WE HAVE SAID SENT HIS OLD SERVANT TO INQUIRE THE CAUSE ON HIS RETURN
COULD THERE HAVE BEEN ANY CONTACT BETWEEN HIM AND ME BUT VILLEFORT UTTERED WORDS WHICH EVEN HE HIMSELF DID NOT BELIEVE HE DREADED NOT SO MUCH THE REVELATION FOR HE COULD REPLY TO OR DENY ITS TRUTH
SAID THE OLD LADY VILLEFORT PLACED THE ARM OF MADAME DE SAINT MERAN WITHIN HIS OWN AND CONDUCTED HER TO HIS APARTMENT REST YOURSELF MOTHER HE SAID THE MARCHIONESS RAISED HER HEAD AT THIS WORD
ALTHOUGH WE DOCTORS CANNOT DIVEST OUR PATIENTS OF NERVES I FANCY YOU HAVE NO FURTHER NEED OF ME THAN TO RECOMMEND YOU NOT TO ALLOW YOUR IMAGINATION TO TAKE TOO WIDE A FIELD VALENTINE COLORED
CHAPTER SEVENTY TWO MADAME DE SAINT MERAN
NONE OF MY ENEMIES WOULD HAVE WAITED SO PATIENTLY AND LABORIOUSLY FOR SO LONG A SPACE OF TIME THAT THEY MIGHT NOW COME AND CRUSH ME WITH THIS SECRET SOMETIMES AS HAMLET SAYS FOUL DEEDS WILL RISE
WHITHER ALL THE ENTREATIES OF MADAME DE VILLEFORT HAD FAILED IN PERSUADING HIM TO ACCOMPANY THEM THE PROCUREUR HAD SHUT HIMSELF UP IN HIS STUDY ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM WITH A HEAP OF PAPERS CALCULATED TO ALARM ANY ONE ELSE
THEN FROM THE BENCH SHE WENT TO THE GATE AS USUAL VALENTINE STROLLED FOR A SHORT TIME AMONG HER FLOWERS BUT WITHOUT GATHERING THEM THE MOURNING IN HER HEART FORBADE HER ASSUMING THIS SIMPLE ORNAMENT
BUT WHICH GENERALLY SCARCELY SATISFIED HIS INORDINATE DESIRES BUT THIS TIME THE PAPERS WERE A MERE MATTER OF FORM VILLEFORT HAD SECLUDED HIMSELF NOT TO STUDY
WITH MY EYES SHUT IN THE SPOT WHERE YOU ARE NOW STANDING ISSUING FROM THAT CORNER WHERE THERE IS A DOOR LEADING INTO MADAME VILLEFORT'S DRESSING ROOM I SAW I TELL YOU SILENTLY ENTER A WHITE FIGURE
IS DEAD ANSWERED THE OLD MARCHIONESS
WHILE MADAME DE VILLEFORT LEANING ON HER HUSBAND'S ARM MAINTAINED ALL OUTWARD FORMS OF RESPECT AT LEAST TOWARDS THE POOR WIDOW SHE SOON WHISPERED TO HER HUSBAND I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO RETIRE
STANDING IN THE DOORWAY NOT DARING TO APPROACH NEARER WERE LOOKING AT NOIRTIER'S OLD SERVANT WHO HAD HEARD THE NOISE FROM HIS MASTER'S ROOM AND RUN THERE ALSO REMAINING BEHIND THE OTHERS VILLEFORT ROSE
YOUR GRANDMAMMA HAS JUST ARRIVED VALENTINE
HAD BEEN UNWELL FOR SOME DAYS STILL THE IDEA OF SEEING OUR DEAR VALENTINE AGAIN INSPIRED HIM WITH COURAGE AND NOTWITHSTANDING HIS ILLNESS HE WOULD LEAVE AT SIX LEAGUES FROM MARSEILLES
HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING FOR ME THAT I PERFORMED FOR HIM IT IS TRUE THAT SINCE I LEFT HIM I SEEM TO HAVE LOST MY SENSES I CANNOT CRY AT MY AGE THEY SAY THAT WE HAVE NO MORE TEARS STILL
AS WHEN DEATH RELAXES ITS VIGILANCE OVER THEM FOR A MOMENT IN ORDER TO STRIKE SOME OTHER OLD PERSON THEN WHILE MADAME DE SAINT MERAN REMAINED ON HER KNEES PRAYING FERVENTLY
IF MY HUSBAND'S SOUL CAN COME TO ME WHY SHOULD NOT MY SOUL REAPPEAR TO GUARD MY GRANDDAUGHTER THE TIE IS EVEN MORE DIRECT IT SEEMS TO ME OH MADAME SAID VILLEFORT DEEPLY AFFECTED IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
FILLED HIS MIND WITH SO MANY GLOOMY THOUGHTS AND BITTER RECOLLECTIONS THEN INSTEAD OF PLUNGING INTO THE MASS OF DOCUMENTS PILED BEFORE HIM HE OPENED THE DRAWER OF HIS DESK TOUCHED A SPRING AND DREW OUT A PARCEL OF CHERISHED MEMORANDA
FROM THE SUMMIT OF A MOUNTAIN BEHOLDS AT HIS FEET THE CRAGGY EMINENCES THE ALMOST IMPASSABLE PATHS AND THE FEARFUL CHASMS THROUGH WHICH HE HAS SO PERILOUSLY CLIMBED
BUT FIRST OF ALL
MAY HAVE HEARD IT AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIMSELF BUT WHY SHOULD HE WISH TO ENLIGHTEN HIMSELF UPON THE SUBJECT ASKED VILLEFORT AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
AND RAN TOWARDS HIS MOTHER IN LAW FOR IT WAS SHE WHY WHAT CAN HAVE HAPPENED HE EXCLAIMED WHAT HAS THUS DISTURBED YOU
THAT THE ONLY REST HE NEEDED WAS TO SEE HIS CHILD BUT WISHED HER GOOD NIGHT FOR GRIEF AND FATIGUE HAD MADE HER APPEAR QUITE ILL THE NEXT MORNING SHE FOUND HER GRANDMOTHER IN BED THE FEVER HAD NOT ABATED
WE NEED NOT SAY WHICH PORTION OF THE GARDEN WAS HER FAVORITE WALK AFTER REMAINING FOR A SHORT TIME IN THE PARTERRE SURROUNDING THE HOUSE AND GATHERING A ROSE TO PLACE IN HER WAIST OR HAIR SHE TURNED INTO THE DARK AVENUE WHICH LED TO THE BENCH
DURING THE WHOLE OF THIS CONVERSATION VALENTINE HAD REMAINED SILENT WELL SIR SAID MADAME DE SAINT MERAN AFTER A FEW MINUTES REFLECTION I MUST HASTEN THE MARRIAGE FOR I HAVE BUT A SHORT TIME TO LIVE
AND WILL MEET HIM IF NOT WITH PLEASURE AT LEAST WITH INDIFFERENCE IS IT A SUITABLE MATCH IN EVERY RESPECT AND THE YOUNG MAN IS REGARDED WITH UNIVERSAL ESTEEM
OH YES SIR HE TOLD ME
I KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING CONTINUED THE MARCHIONESS I MUST HURRY YOU SO THAT AS SHE HAS NO MOTHER SHE MAY AT LEAST HAVE A GRANDMOTHER TO BLESS HER MARRIAGE I AM ALL THAT IS LEFT TO HER BELONGING TO MY POOR RENEE
MORE THAN ONCE SHE THOUGHT OF REVEALING ALL TO HER GRANDMOTHER AND SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HESITATED A MOMENT IF MAXIMILIAN MORREL HAD BEEN NAMED ALBERT DE MORCERF OR RAOUL DE CHATEAU RENAUD BUT MORREL
OUR BUSINESS CONCERNS VALENTINE LET US LEAVE THE DEAD IN PEACE ALL THIS WAS SAID WITH SUCH EXCEEDING RAPIDITY THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE CONVERSATION THAT SEEMED LIKE THE BEGINNING OF DELIRIUM
THE NOISE OF A CARRIAGE SOUNDED IN THE YARD THEN HE HEARD THE STEPS OF AN AGED PERSON ASCENDING THE STAIRS FOLLOWED BY TEARS AND LAMENTATIONS SUCH AS SERVANTS ALWAYS GIVE VENT TO
AND NOIRTIER HAD NEVER BEEN ON STRICT TERMS OF FRIENDSHIP STILL THE DEATH OF ONE OLD MAN ALWAYS CONSIDERABLY AFFECTS ANOTHER NOIRTIER LET HIS HEAD FALL UPON HIS CHEST APPARENTLY OVERWHELMED AND THOUGHTFUL
VILLEFORT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE TO REPLY THAT VALENTINE WAS AT A BALL SO HE ONLY SAID THAT SHE HAD GONE OUT WITH HER STEP MOTHER AND THAT SHE SHOULD BE FETCHED THIS INSTANT SIR THIS INSTANT I BESEECH YOU
IN FACT I WILL KNOW HIM I WILL CONTINUED THE OLD LADY WITH A FEARFUL EXPRESSION THAT I MAY RISE FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY GRAVE TO FIND HIM IF HE SHOULD NOT FULFIL HIS DUTY MADAME SAID VILLEFORT
AND FEAR TO HIM FROM HER MOTHER HAVING BEEN CONSUMPTIVE OH SAID VALENTINE WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU WITH SUCH IMPATIENCE
AND THIS MORNING SHE FRIGHTENED ME SO THAT I THOUGHT HER MAD AND MY FATHER WHO YOU KNOW IS A STRONG MINDED MAN HIMSELF APPEARED DEEPLY IMPRESSED WE WILL GO AND SEE SAID THE DOCTOR WHAT YOU TELL ME SEEMS VERY STRANGE
ANTOINETTE IS VERY WELL HE SAID AND MADELEINE TOLERABLY SO BUT YOU SENT FOR ME MY DEAR CHILD IT IS NOT YOUR FATHER OR MADAME DE VILLEFORT WHO IS ILL AS FOR YOU
DO NOT YIELD TO THOSE GLOOMY THOUGHTS YOU WILL LONG LIVE WITH US HAPPY LOVED AND HONORED AND WE WILL MAKE YOU FORGET NEVER NEVER NEVER SAID THE MARCHIONESS
AND BEG HER TO COME UP HERE IS THAT WHAT YOU WISH FOR YES REPLIED THE INVALID BARROIS THEREFORE AS WE HAVE SEEN WATCHED FOR VALENTINE AND INFORMED HER OF HER GRANDFATHER'S WISH CONSEQUENTLY
ALAS SAID VALENTINE RESTRAINING HER TEARS MY GRANDFATHER IS DEAD
NO MY CHILD NO SAID MADAME DE SAINT MERAN BUT I WAS IMPATIENTLY WAITING FOR YOUR ARRIVAL THAT I MIGHT SEND FOR YOUR FATHER MY FATHER INQUIRED VALENTINE UNEASILY YES I WISH TO SPEAK TO HIM
BY THE SAD CONVICTION THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO DO SO FOR WERE IT ONCE DISCOVERED BY HER FATHER AND MOTHER ALL WOULD BE LOST TWO HOURS PASSED THUS
THE NOTARY WHO WAS AT THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY ENTERED GO VALENTINE
VALENTINE FOUND HER GRANDMOTHER IN BED SILENT CARESSES HEARTWRUNG SOBS BROKEN SIGHS
YES SUDDENLY FROM AN APOPLECTIC STROKE AN APOPLECTIC STROKE REPEATED THE DOCTOR YES AND MY POOR GRANDMOTHER FANCIES THAT HER HUSBAND WHOM SHE NEVER LEFT HAS CALLED HER AND THAT SHE MUST GO AND JOIN HIM
WE EXPECT HIM EVERY MOMENT IT IS WELL AS SOON AS HE ARRIVES INFORM ME WE MUST BE EXPEDITIOUS AND THEN I ALSO WISH TO SEE A NOTARY THAT I MAY BE ASSURED
AND AS IF FEARING SHE HAD NO TIME TO LOSE YOU WROTE TO ME CONCERNING THE MARRIAGE OF THIS CHILD YES MADAME REPLIED VILLEFORT IT IS NOT ONLY PROJECTED BUT ARRANGED YOUR INTENDED SON IN LAW
I APPLIED MY SMELLING SALTS BUT ALL WAS OVER AND I ARRIVED AT AIX BY THE SIDE OF A CORPSE VILLEFORT STOOD WITH HIS MOUTH HALF OPEN QUITE STUPEFIED OF COURSE YOU SENT FOR A DOCTOR
DOES HE NOT DISLIKE THE IDEA OF MARRYING THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A JACOBIN OUR CIVIL DISSENSIONS ARE NOW HAPPILY EXTINGUISHED MOTHER SAID VILLEFORT
UPON WHICH STOOD A BOTTLE OF ORANGEADE HER USUAL BEVERAGE AND A GLASS THEN AS WE HAVE SAID THE YOUNG GIRL
IMMEDIATELY BUT AS I HAVE TOLD YOU IT WAS TOO LATE YES BUT THEN HE COULD TELL
VALENTINE INSTANTLY RAN DOWN THE DOCTOR WAS A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE CLEVEREST MEN OF THE DAY AND VERY FOND OF VALENTINE WHOSE BIRTH HE HAD WITNESSED HE HAD HIMSELF A DAUGHTER ABOUT HER AGE
AND WENT HIMSELF TO FETCH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER FROM MADAME DE MORCERF'S HE WAS SO PALE WHEN HE APPEARED AT THE DOOR OF THE BALL ROOM THAT VALENTINE RAN TO HIM SAYING OH FATHER SOME MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED
THE MARCHIONESS DRAINED THE GLASS AT A SINGLE DRAUGHT AND THEN TURNED ON HER PILLOW REPEATING THE NOTARY THE NOTARY
VALENTINE KISSED THE OLD MAN WHO LOOKED AT HER WITH SUCH TENDERNESS THAT HER EYES AGAIN FILLED WITH TEARS WHOSE SOURCES HE THOUGHT MUST BE EXHAUSTED THE OLD GENTLEMAN CONTINUED TO DWELL UPON HER WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION
VALENTINE SCREAMED IT WAS THE FEVER THAT DISTURBED YOU MADAME SAID VILLEFORT DOUBT IF YOU PLEASE BUT I AM SURE OF WHAT I SAY I SAW A WHITE FIGURE AND AS IF TO PREVENT MY DISCREDITING THE TESTIMONY
AND BEHOLDING THE MAN WHO SO FORCIBLY REMINDED HER OF HER DEEPLY REGRETTED CHILD WHO STILL LIVED FOR HER IN VALENTINE SHE FELT TOUCHED AT THE NAME OF MOTHER AND BURSTING INTO TEARS SHE FELL ON HER KNEES BEFORE AN ARM CHAIR
AS FROM A PERSON SUFFERING IN HIS DREAMS AND HE SUDDENLY THREW HIS HEAD BACK VIOLENTLY I CALLED THE VALET I STOPPED THE POSTILION
IT WAS JUST IN TIME FOR VALENTINE'S HEAD SWAM AND SHE STAGGERED MADAME DE VILLEFORT INSTANTLY HASTENED TO HER ASSISTANCE AND AIDED HER HUSBAND IN DRAGGING HER TO THE CARRIAGE SAYING WHAT A SINGULAR EVENT
IN AN UNDERTONE TELL HIM I WILL COME WHEN I LEAVE MY DEAR GRANDMAMMA SHE REPLIED FEELING WITH TRUE DELICACY THAT THE PERSON TO WHOM SHE COULD BE OF THE MOST SERVICE JUST THEN WAS MADAME DE SAINT MERAN
ALWAYS I TELL YOU I AM GOING TO DIE DO YOU UNDERSTAND WELL BEFORE DYING I WISH TO SEE MY SON IN LAW I WISH TO TELL HIM TO MAKE MY CHILD HAPPY I WISH TO READ IN HIS EYES WHETHER HE INTENDS TO OBEY ME
YES YES SAID VALENTINE YOU MEAN THAT I HAVE YET A KIND GRANDFATHER LEFT DO YOU NOT THE OLD MAN INTIMATED THAT SUCH WAS HIS MEANING AH YES HAPPILY I HAVE REPLIED VALENTINE
AS YOU SAY I AM MYSELF AGITATED FEVERISH AND OUT OF SORTS I WILL GO AND TAKE A TURN IN THE GARDEN TO RECOVER MYSELF THE DOCTOR PRESSED VALENTINE'S HAND AND WHILE HE VISITED HER GRANDMOTHER SHE DESCENDED THE STEPS
THE NOTARY HERE DESCENDED AND VALENTINE WAS INFORMED THAT HER GRANDMOTHER WAS ALONE GO UPSTAIRS SHE SAID TO THE DOCTOR AND YOU OH I DARE NOT SHE FORBADE MY SENDING FOR YOU AND
I THINK THAT WHEN ONE IS IN TROUBLE ONE SHOULD HAVE THE POWER OF WEEPING WHERE IS VALENTINE SIR IT IS ON HER ACCOUNT I AM HERE I WISH TO SEE VALENTINE
HIS QUICK INTELLIGENT EYE INTERROGATED THE MESSENGER ALAS SIR EXCLAIMED BARROIS A GREAT MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED MADAME DE SAINT MERAN HAS ARRIVED AND HER HUSBAND IS DEAD
YES YES SHE SAID SOFTLY TO VALENTINE LET HER LEAVE BUT DO YOU STAY MADAME DE VILLEFORT LEFT AND VALENTINE REMAINED ALONE BESIDE THE BED FOR THE PROCUREUR OVERCOME WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THE UNEXPECTED DEATH
AFTER HAVING EATEN SOME OF THE LOZENGES HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO TAKE HE FELL INTO SUCH A DEEP SLEEP THAT IT APPEARED TO ME UNNATURAL STILL I HESITATED TO WAKE HIM ALTHOUGH I FANCIED THAT HIS FACE WAS FLUSHED
BUT GRANDMAMMA LEAVE ME GO THE YOUNG GIRL KISSED HER GRANDMOTHER AND LEFT WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES AT THE DOOR SHE FOUND THE VALET DE CHAMBRE WHO TOLD HER THAT THE DOCTOR WAS WAITING IN THE DINING ROOM
AND DIFFICULT AND HER PULSE BEAT WITH FEVERISH EXCITEMENT SHE WAS THINKING OF THE DESPAIR OF MAXIMILIAN WHEN HE SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT MADAME DE SAINT MERAN INSTEAD OF BEING AN ALLY WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY ACTING AS HIS ENEMY
SHE APPEARED TO BE STUPEFIED VILLEFORT DREW BACK AND CLASPING HIS HANDS TOGETHER EXCLAIMED DEAD SO SUDDENLY A WEEK AGO CONTINUED MADAME DE SAINT MERAN
WHAT A MISFORTUNE I SHALL DIE OF IT OH YES I SHALL CERTAINLY DIE OF IT AND THEN FALLING UPON THE CHAIR NEAREST THE DOOR SHE BURST INTO A PAROXYSM OF SOBS THE SERVANTS
YOU MUST LAY ASIDE THESE EXALTED IDEAS WHICH ALMOST ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF MADNESS THE DEAD ONCE BURIED IN THEIR GRAVES RISE NO MORE AND I TELL YOU SIR THAT YOU ARE MISTAKEN THIS NIGHT
NOIRTIER AGAIN CLOSED HIS LEFT EYE DO YOU WISH TO SEE HER NOIRTIER AGAIN MADE AN AFFIRMATIVE SIGN WELL THEY HAVE GONE TO FETCH HER NO DOUBT FROM MADAME DE MORCERF'S I WILL AWAIT HER RETURN
AMONG ALL THE INCOHERENT DETAILS GIVEN TO ME BY THE ABBE BUSONI AND BY LORD WILMORE BY THAT FRIEND AND THAT ENEMY ONE THING APPEARS CERTAIN AND CLEAR IN MY OPINION THAT IN NO PERIOD IN NO CASE IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE
YOU MADAME YOU DEAR MAMMA
MY DEAR GRANDMOTHER INTERRUPTED VALENTINE CONSIDER DECORUM THE RECENT DEATH YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ME MARRY UNDER SUCH SAD AUSPICES MY CHILD EXCLAIMED THE OLD LADY SHARPLY LET US HEAR NONE OF THE CONVENTIONAL OBJECTIONS
HAD ALWAYS EXPRESSED A DESIRE IN CASE HIS DEATH HAPPENED DURING HIS ABSENCE FROM PARIS THAT HIS BODY MIGHT BE BROUGHT TO THE FAMILY VAULT I HAD HIM PUT INTO A LEADEN COFFIN
BUT WHEN I DID SO THE SHADE DISAPPEARED MY MAID THEN ENTERED WITH A LIGHT BUT SHE SAW NO ONE PHANTOMS ARE VISIBLE TO THOSE ONLY WHO OUGHT TO SEE THEM IT WAS THE SOUL OF MY HUSBAND WELL
AS YOUR FALL WOULD BE A SIGNAL FOR THE HEAVIEST VENGEANCE AND AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD TO MEDITATE UPON ATHENIANS THE END OF OUR EMPIRE IF END IT SHOULD DOES NOT FRIGHTEN US
AS IF A SALLY WERE INTENDED UPON HEARING THIS HE WENT UP TO LOOK AND HAVING DONE SO BEING UNWILLING TO VENTURE UPON THE DECISIVE STEP OF A BATTLE BEFORE HIS REINFORCEMENTS CAME UP
THAT HAS MADE THE ENEMY MARCH UP TO THE PLACE AND CARELESSLY LOOK ABOUT HIM AS HE IS DOING WITHOUT NOTICING US BUT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SOLDIER WILL ALWAYS BE THE MAN WHO MOST HAPPILY DETECTS A BLUNDER LIKE THIS
IN THE BELIEF OF ULTIMATE VICTORY WHICH HER SUCCESS AT THE MOMENT HAD INSPIRED BESIDES SHE WAS AFRAID OF HER ALLIES BEING TEMPTED BY HER REVERSES TO REBEL MORE GENERALLY
THE ATHENIAN RIGHT MADE A BETTER STAND
NO COWARDICE THEN ON YOUR PART SEEING THE GREATNESS OF THE ISSUES AT STAKE AND I WILL SHOW THAT WHAT I PREACH TO OTHERS I CAN PRACTISE MYSELF
PASITELIDAS BEGAN TO BE AFRAID THAT THEY MIGHT GET UP TO THE CITY BEFORE ITS DEFENDERS WERE THERE AND THE FORTIFICATION BEING ALSO CARRIED HE MIGHT BE TAKEN PRISONER AND SO ABANDONED THE OUTWORK AND RAN INTO THE TOWN
THUS THE ATHENIAN ARMY WAS ALL NOW IN FLIGHT AND SUCH AS ESCAPED BEING KILLED IN THE BATTLE OR BY THE CHALCIDIAN HORSE AND THE TARGETEERS DISPERSED AMONG THE HILLS AND WITH DIFFICULTY
AND HELPING THEIR ENEMIES ATHENIANS THEN YOU DO NOT ADOPT THE VIEW THAT EXPEDIENCY GOES WITH SECURITY WHILE JUSTICE AND HONOUR CANNOT BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT DANGER
AND WHO CAREFULLY CONSULTING HIS OWN MEANS MAKES HIS ATTACK NOT SO MUCH BY OPEN AND REGULAR APPROACHES AS BY SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE MOMENT
IF YOU RISK SO MUCH TO RETAIN YOUR EMPIRE AND YOUR SUBJECTS TO GET RID OF IT
THE MELIANS ATTACKED BY NIGHT AND TOOK THE PART OF THE ATHENIAN LINES OVER AGAINST THE MARKET AND KILLED SOME OF THE MEN AND BROUGHT IN CORN AND ALL ELSE THAT THEY COULD FIND USEFUL TO THEM AND SO RETURNED AND KEPT QUIET
HAD BEEN THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DULY ACCOMPLISHED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE GRAVES OF THE DEAD THE DELIANS HAD ATRAMYTTIUM IN ASIA GIVEN THEM BY PHARNACES AND SETTLED THERE AS THEY REMOVED FROM DELOS MEANWHILE
WHEN IT MAKES YOU THE MODERATE OFFER OF BECOMING ITS TRIBUTARY ALLY WITHOUT CEASING TO ENJOY THE COUNTRY THAT BELONGS TO YOU NOR WHEN YOU HAVE THE CHOICE GIVEN YOU BETWEEN WAR AND SECURITY
MELIANS BUT THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERS TO SEND THE CRETAN SEA IS A WIDE ONE AND IT IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE WHO COMMAND IT TO INTERCEPT OTHERS THAN FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO ELUDE THEM TO DO SO SAFELY
AND ALSO FELL IN WITH SOME LOCRIAN SETTLERS EXILED FROM MESSINA WHO HAD BEEN SENT THITHER WHEN THE LOCRIANS WERE CALLED IN BY ONE OF THE FACTIONS THAT DIVIDED MESSINA AFTER THE PACIFICATION OF SICILY
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE ISLANDERS AND WEAKER THAN OTHERS RENDERING IT ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SUCCEED IN BAFFLING THE MASTERS OF THE SEA MELIANS BUT DO YOU CONSIDER
THE NEXT SUMMER THE TRUCE FOR A YEAR ENDED AFTER LASTING UNTIL THE PYTHIAN GAMES DURING THE ARMISTICE THE ATHENIANS EXPELLED THE DELIANS FROM DELOS
ENCAMPING IN THEIR TERRITORY WITH THE ABOVE ARMAMENT BEFORE DOING ANY HARM TO THEIR LAND SENT ENVOYS TO NEGOTIATE THESE THE MELIANS DID NOT BRING BEFORE THE PEOPLE
CALLING TO HIS STANDARD FIFTEEN HUNDRED THRACIAN MERCENARIES AND ALL THE EDONIANS HORSE AND TARGETEERS HE ALSO HAD A THOUSAND MYRCINIAN AND CHALCIDIAN TARGETEERS BESIDES THOSE IN AMPHIPOLIS
THESE CONSIDERATIONS MADE BOTH SIDES DISPOSED FOR AN ACCOMMODATION THE LACEDAEMONIANS BEING PROBABLY THE MOST EAGER AS THEY ARDENTLY DESIRED TO RECOVER THE MEN TAKEN UPON THE ISLAND
WHENCE HOWEVER THEY ALL CAME HOME AFTERWARDS THE PELOPONNESIANS ON THE CONCLUSION OF PEACE AND THE REST BY BEING EXCHANGED AGAINST OTHER PRISONERS WITH THE OLYNTHIANS ABOUT THE SAME TIME PANACTUM
IN ORDER THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK STRAIGHT ON WITHOUT INTERRUPTION AND DECEIVE THE EARS OF THE MULTITUDE BY SEDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS WHICH WOULD PASS WITHOUT REFUTATION FOR WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE MEANING OF OUR BEING BROUGHT BEFORE THE FEW
MAY NOT DAMP YOUR COURAGE BY THE APPARENT DISADVANTAGE AT WHICH IT PLACES YOU I IMAGINE IT IS THE POOR OPINION THAT HE HAS OF US AND THE FACT THAT HE HAS NO IDEA OF ANY ONE COMING OUT TO ENGAGE HIM
AND TWO LESBIAN VESSELS SIXTEEN HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY THREE HUNDRED ARCHERS AND TWENTY MOUNTED ARCHERS FROM ATHENS AND ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY FROM THE ALLIES AND THE ISLANDERS
BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF SUBMITTING BEFORE SUFFERING THE WORST AND WE SHOULD GAIN BY NOT DESTROYING YOU MELIANS SO THAT YOU WOULD NOT CONSENT TO OUR BEING NEUTRAL
AND ALSO ATTACKED THE ENEMY THE RESULT WAS THAT THE ATHENIANS SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY ATTACKED ON BOTH SIDES FELL INTO CONFUSION
WHILE THEIR SPIRIT IS SLACK AND NOT HIGH STRUNG WITH EXPECTATION I WITH THE MEN UNDER MY COMMAND WILL IF POSSIBLE TAKE THEM BY SURPRISE AND FALL WITH A RUN UPON THEIR CENTRE
UNLESS THE TERMS BE EQUAL BUT WE TRUST THAT THE GODS MAY GRANT US FORTUNE AS GOOD AS YOURS SINCE WE ARE JUST MEN FIGHTING AGAINST UNJUST
THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ALLOWED IN DANGER TO INVOKE WHAT IS FAIR AND RIGHT AND EVEN TO PROFIT BY ARGUMENTS NOT STRICTLY VALID IF THEY CAN BE GOT TO PASS CURRENT AND YOU ARE AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THIS AS ANY
WHO FROM THE FIRST HAD NO THOUGHT OF FIGHTING AT ONCE FLED AND WAS OVERTAKEN AND SLAIN BY A MYRCINIAN TARGETEER
HE RECEIVED A WOUND BUT HIS FALL WAS NOT PERCEIVED BY THE ATHENIANS
TO RENEW THEIR OLD ATTEMPTS AT REVOLUTION BESIDES THIS AS CHANCE WOULD HAVE IT
AND DO YOU ALLIES FOLLOW HIM LIKE MEN AND REMEMBER THAT ZEAL HONOUR AND OBEDIENCE MARK THE GOOD SOLDIER
WITH HONOUR AS THE PRIZE AND SHAME AS THE PENALTY BUT A QUESTION OF SELF PRESERVATION AND OF NOT RESISTING THOSE WHO ARE FAR STRONGER THAN YOU ARE MELIANS
QUICK SOMEONE AND OPEN THE GATES I SPOKE OF AND LET US BE OUT AND AT THEM WITH NO FEARS FOR THE RESULT ACCORDINGLY ISSUING OUT BY THE PALISADE GATE AND BY THE FIRST IN THE LONG WALL THEN EXISTING
HE NOW SENT ENVOYS TO PERDICCAS TO COMMAND HIS ATTENDANCE WITH AN ARMY AS PROVIDED BY THE ALLIANCE AND OTHERS TO THRACE
AND A FORCE OF HEAVY INFANTRY NUMBERING ALTOGETHER ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED HELLENIC HORSE
ONLY WHEN THEY ARE RUINED BUT SO LONG AS THE DISCOVERY WOULD ENABLE THEM TO GUARD AGAINST IT IT IS NEVER FOUND WANTING LET NOT THIS BE THE CASE WITH YOU WHO ARE WEAK AND HANG ON A SINGLE TURN OF THE SCALE
AND DREW A LINE OF CIRCUMVALLATION ROUND THE MELIANS DIVIDING THE WORK AMONG THE DIFFERENT STATES SUBSEQUENTLY THE ATHENIANS RETURNED WITH MOST OF THEIR ARMY
SINCE IN TOO MANY CASES THE VERY MEN THAT HAVE THEIR EYES PERFECTLY OPEN TO WHAT THEY ARE RUSHING INTO LET THE THING CALLED DISGRACE BY THE MERE INFLUENCE OF A SEDUCTIVE NAME
AWAITING THEIR ARRIVAL INFORMED OF THIS
WE WILL NOW PROCEED TO SHOW YOU THAT WE ARE COME HERE IN THE INTEREST OF OUR EMPIRE AND THAT WE SHALL SAY WHAT WE ARE NOW GOING TO SAY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF YOUR COUNTRY AS WE WOULD FAIN EXERCISE THAT EMPIRE
WITH TWELVE HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY AND THREE HUNDRED HORSE FROM ATHENS
ARE THINGS THAT DO NOT NEED FURTHER COMMENT BUT THE PLAN OF ATTACK THAT I PROPOSE TO PURSUE THIS IT IS AS WELL TO EXPLAIN IN ORDER THAT THE FACT OF OUR ADVENTURING WITH A PART INSTEAD OF WITH THE WHOLE OF OUR FORCES
DESPISING THE SCANTY NUMBERS OF HIS OPPONENT WOULD MARCH AGAINST AMPHIPOLIS WITH THE FORCE THAT HE HAD GOT WITH HIM
AND WORD WAS BROUGHT TO CLEON WHO HAD AT THE MOMENT GONE ON TO LOOK ABOUT HIM THAT THE WHOLE OF THE ENEMY'S FORCE COULD BE SEEN IN THE TOWN AND THAT THE FEET OF HORSES AND MEN IN GREAT NUMBERS WERE VISIBLE UNDER THE GATES
AND SUBJECTS SMARTING UNDER THE YOKE WHO WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY TO TAKE A RASH STEP AND LEAD THEMSELVES AND US INTO OBVIOUS DANGER MELIANS WELL THEN
ONE BY THE HARBOUR THE OTHER BY THE FORTIFICATION AND MAKING SLAVES OF THE WIVES AND CHILDREN OF THE TORONAEANS SENT THE MEN WITH THE PELOPONNESIANS AND ANY CHALCIDIANS THAT WERE THERE TO THE NUMBER OF SEVEN HUNDRED TO ATHENS
WHILE ACTION STILL PRESERVES FOR US A HOPE THAT WE MAY STAND ERECT ATHENIANS HOPE DANGER'S COMFORTER MAY BE INDULGED IN BY THOSE WHO HAVE ABUNDANT RESOURCES
SO THAT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGHT ARGOS AND ATHENS AT ONCE SHE ALSO SUSPECTED SOME OF THE CITIES IN PELOPONNESE OF INTENDING TO GO OVER TO THE ENEMY AND THAT WAS INDEED THE CASE
SO WILL YOU BE MOST COMPLETELY DECEIVED THE ATHENIAN ENVOYS NOW RETURNED TO THE ARMY AND THE MELIANS SHOWING NO SIGNS OF YIELDING
NOR BE LIKE THE VULGAR WHO ABANDONING SUCH SECURITY AS HUMAN MEANS MAY STILL AFFORD WHEN VISIBLE HOPES FAIL THEM IN EXTREMITY TURN TO INVISIBLE TO PROPHECIES AND ORACLES
OF THE GODS WE BELIEVE AND OF MEN WE KNOW THAT BY A NECESSARY LAW OF THEIR NATURE THEY RULE WHEREVER THEY CAN AND IT IS NOT AS IF WE WERE THE FIRST TO MAKE THIS LAW OR TO ACT UPON IT WHEN MADE
THE ATHENIANS HEARING THIS SENT PHAEAX TO SEE IF THEY COULD NOT BY SOME MEANS SO CONVINCE THEIR ALLIES THERE AND THE REST OF THE SICILIANS OF THE AMBITIOUS DESIGNS OF SYRACUSE
A FORTRESS ON THE ATHENIAN BORDER
THE FLOWER OF THE ATHENIAN ARMY BEING IN THE FIELD WITH THE BEST OF THE LEMNIANS AND IMBRIANS HE THEREFORE PREPARED TO ASSAIL THEM BY STRATAGEM BY SHOWING THE ENEMY THE NUMBER OF HIS TROOPS AND THE SHIFTS
BUT IT IS FOR THIS VERY REASON THAT WE NOW TRUST TO THEIR RESPECT FOR EXPEDIENCY TO PREVENT THEM FROM BETRAYING THE MELIANS THEIR COLONISTS AND THEREBY LOSING THE CONFIDENCE OF THEIR FRIENDS IN HELLAS
THAT THERE IS NO SECURITY IN THE POLICY WHICH WE INDICATE FOR HERE AGAIN IF YOU DEBAR US FROM TALKING ABOUT JUSTICE AND INVITE US TO OBEY YOUR INTEREST WE ALSO MUST EXPLAIN OURS
PELOPONNESIANS THE CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH WE HAVE COME ONE WHICH HAS ALWAYS OWED ITS FREEDOM TO VALOUR AND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE DORIANS AND THE ENEMY YOU ARE ABOUT TO FIGHT IONIANS WHOM YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BEAT
AND THEY REFUSED TO RENEW IT
AS ALREADY COMING TO PASS AND AS YOU HAVE STAKED MOST ON AND TRUSTED MOST IN
MEANWHILE HE HAD BEEN SEEN COMING DOWN FROM CERDYLIUM AND THEN IN THE CITY WHICH IS OVERLOOKED FROM THE OUTSIDE SACRIFICING NEAR THE TEMPLE OF ATHENE IN SHORT ALL HIS MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN OBSERVED
INDEED IT SO HAPPENED THAT DIRECTLY AFTER THE BATTLE OF AMPHIPOLIS AND THE RETREAT OF RAMPHIAS FROM THESSALY BOTH SIDES CEASED TO PROSECUTE THE WAR AND TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO PEACE
CONCLUDING THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN POLLUTED BY SOME OLD OFFENCE AT THE TIME OF THEIR CONSECRATION AND THAT THIS HAD BEEN THE OMISSION IN THE PREVIOUS PURIFICATION OF THE ISLAND WHICH AS I HAVE RELATED
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED OF THE LATTER HAD FALLEN AND ONLY SEVEN OF THE ENEMY OWING TO THERE HAVING BEEN NO REGULAR ENGAGEMENT BUT THE AFFAIR OF ACCIDENT AND PANIC THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED AFTER TAKING UP THEIR DEAD THE ATHENIANS SAILED OFF HOME
AND BROKE UP HIS CAMP AND ADVANCED THE TEMPER OF THE GENERAL WAS WHAT IT HAD BEEN AT PYLOS HIS SUCCESS ON THAT OCCASION HAVING GIVEN HIM CONFIDENCE IN HIS CAPACITY
OR SLAVES OF ATHENS EVEN IF YOU ESCAPE WITHOUT PERSONAL LOSS OF LIBERTY OR LIFE YOUR BONDAGE WILL BE ON HARSHER TERMS THAN BEFORE AND YOU WILL ALSO HINDER THE LIBERATION OF THE REST OF THE HELLENES
WHILE THE STRONG DO WHAT THEY CAN AND THE WEAK SUFFER WHAT THEY MUST MELIANS AS WE THINK AT ANY RATE IT IS EXPEDIENT
THAN WHEN IT COMES AS THE RESULT OF MISFORTUNE THIS IF YOU ARE WELL ADVISED YOU WILL GUARD AGAINST AND YOU WILL NOT THINK IT DISHONOURABLE TO SUBMIT TO THE GREATEST CITY IN HELLAS
WHOM THEY CAME TO REINFORCE WAS DEAD THEY TURNED BACK HOME THINKING THAT THE MOMENT HAD GONE BY THE ATHENIANS BEING DEFEATED AND GONE AND THEMSELVES NOT EQUAL TO THE EXECUTION OF BRASIDAS'S DESIGNS
IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONG AND THAT IF WE DO NOT MOLEST THEM IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID SO THAT BESIDES EXTENDING OUR EMPIRE WE SHOULD GAIN IN SECURITY BY YOUR SUBJECTION
HAVE THE MOST BRILLIANT NAME IN WAR THEREFORE WHILE THEIR CARELESS CONFIDENCE CONTINUES AND THEY ARE STILL THINKING AS IN MY JUDGMENT THEY ARE NOW DOING MORE OF RETREAT THAN OF MAINTAINING THEIR POSITION
OVER YOU WITHOUT TROUBLE AND SEE YOU PRESERVED FOR THE GOOD OF US BOTH MELIANS AND HOW PRAY COULD IT TURN OUT AS GOOD FOR US TO SERVE AS FOR YOU TO RULE ATHENIANS
AS IS LIKELY DEALING TERROR AMONG THEM TAKE WITH YOU THE AMPHIPOLITANS AND THE REST OF THE ALLIES AND SUDDENLY OPEN THE GATES AND DASH AT THEM AND HASTEN TO ENGAGE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN THAT
WILL YOU BE SO BLINDED AS TO CHOOSE THE WORSE AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT THOSE WHO DO NOT YIELD TO THEIR EQUALS WHO KEEP TERMS WITH THEIR SUPERIORS AND ARE MODERATE TOWARDS THEIR INFERIORS ON THE WHOLE SUCCEED BEST
HE RAN AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED ALONG THE STRAIGHT ROAD WHERE THE TROPHY NOW STANDS AS YOU GO BY THE STEEPEST PART OF THE HILL AND FELL UPON AND ROUTED THE CENTRE OF THE ATHENIANS PANIC STRICKEN BY THEIR OWN DISORDER AND ASTOUNDED AT HIS AUDACITY
KNOWING THAT YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE HAVING THE SAME POWER AS WE HAVE WOULD DO THE SAME AS WE DO THUS AS FAR AS THE GODS ARE CONCERNED WE HAVE NO FEAR AND NO REASON TO FEAR THAT WE SHALL BE AT A DISADVANTAGE
SHE SAW HER COUNTRY PLUNDERED FROM PYLOS AND CYTHERA THE HELOTS WERE DESERTING AND SHE WAS IN CONSTANT APPREHENSION THAT THOSE WHO REMAINED IN PELOPONNESE WOULD RELY UPON THOSE OUTSIDE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION
LEAD THEM ON TO A POINT AT WHICH THEY BECOME SO ENSLAVED BY THE PHRASE AS IN FACT TO FALL WILFULLY INTO HOPELESS DISASTER AND INCUR DISGRACE MORE DISGRACEFUL AS THE COMPANION OF ERROR
AND HAD ONLY ABOUT FOUR MILES MORE TO GO WHEN HE HEARD OF ITS FALL ON THE ROAD AND TURNED BACK AGAIN
A QUARTER OF THE TOWN OF LEONTINI AND BRICINNIAE A STRONG PLACE IN THE LEONTINE COUNTRY AND BEING THERE JOINED BY MOST OF THE EXILED COMMONS CARRIED ON WAR FROM THE FORTIFICATIONS
MELIANS IT IS NATURAL AND EXCUSABLE FOR MEN IN OUR POSITION TO TURN MORE WAYS THAN ONE BOTH IN THOUGHT AND UTTERANCE HOWEVER THE QUESTION IN THIS CONFERENCE IS AS YOU SAY
IF ONLY FOR VERY SHAME TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR KINDRED OUR CONFIDENCE THEREFORE AFTER ALL IS NOT SO UTTERLY IRRATIONAL ATHENIANS
BUT BADE THEM STATE THE OBJECT OF THEIR MISSION TO THE MAGISTRATES AND THE FEW UPON WHICH THE ATHENIAN ENVOYS SPOKE AS FOLLOWS ATHENIANS SINCE THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT TO GO ON BEFORE THE PEOPLE
AND AT FIRST REMAINED NEUTRAL AND TOOK NO PART IN THE STRUGGLE BUT AFTERWARDS UPON THE ATHENIANS USING VIOLENCE AND PLUNDERING THEIR TERRITORY ASSUMED AN ATTITUDE OF OPEN HOSTILITY
AND HOW THE TOWN LAY ON THE SIDE OF THRACE HE THOUGHT TO RETIRE AT PLEASURE WITHOUT FIGHTING AS THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN UPON THE WALL OR COMING OUT OF THE GATES ALL OF WHICH WERE SHUT INDEED
PROCEEDED ON HIS VOYAGE AND AT LENGTH ARRIVED AT ATHENS CLEON
WHO WAS TO BRING AS MANY THRACIAN MERCENARIES AS POSSIBLE
STRIPPED THE DEAD AND SET UP A TROPHY
MIGHT PLUNDER THE ATHENIANS THE CORINTHIANS ALSO COMMENCED HOSTILITIES WITH THE ATHENIANS FOR PRIVATE QUARRELS OF THEIR OWN BUT THE REST OF THE PELOPONNESIANS STAYED QUIET MEANWHILE
SET SAIL WITH TWO COLLEAGUES AS AMBASSADOR FROM ATHENS TO ITALY AND SICILY
THAT ARE MOST OF THEM YOUR OWN COLONISTS AND SOME CONQUERED REBELS ATHENIANS AS FAR AS RIGHT GOES THEY THINK ONE HAS AS MUCH OF IT AS THE OTHER AND THAT IF ANY MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE
KILLING SOME OF THE PELOPONNESIANS AND TORONAEANS IN THE MELEE AND MAKING PRISONERS OF THE REST AND PASITELIDAS THEIR COMMANDER AMONGST THEM
SOME DIVERSION OF THE KIND YOU SPEAK OF YOU MAY ONE DAY EXPERIENCE ONLY TO LEARN AS OTHERS HAVE DONE THAT THE ATHENIANS NEVER ONCE YET WITHDREW FROM A SIEGE FOR FEAR OF ANY
HE NEVER DREAMED OF ANY ONE COMING OUT TO FIGHT HIM BUT SAID THAT HE WAS RATHER GOING UP TO VIEW THE PLACE AND IF HE WAITED FOR HIS REINFORCEMENTS IT WAS NOT IN ORDER TO MAKE VICTORY SECURE IN CASE HE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO ENGAGE
IN FRONT OF WHAT IS NOW THE MARKETPLACE AND THE AMPHIPOLITANS HAVING ENCLOSED HIS TOMB EVER AFTERWARDS SACRIFICE TO HIM AS A HERO AND HAVE GIVEN TO HIM THE HONOUR OF GAMES AND ANNUAL OFFERINGS
FOUND THE EVENT OF THE WAR TO FALSIFY HER NOTION THAT A FEW YEARS WOULD SUFFICE FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE POWER OF THE ATHENIANS BY THE DEVASTATION OF THEIR LAND SHE HAD SUFFERED ON THE ISLAND A DISASTER HITHERTO UNKNOWN AT SPARTA
AND FANCYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO RETIRE
WHICH LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT SHAME WILL MAKE THEM HELP YOU HERE WE BLESS YOUR SIMPLICITY BUT DO NOT ENVY YOUR FOLLY THE LACEDAEMONIANS WHEN THEIR OWN INTERESTS OR THEIR COUNTRY'S LAWS ARE IN QUESTION
HE DID NOT VENTURE TO GO OUT IN REGULAR ORDER AGAINST THE ATHENIANS HE MISTRUSTED HIS STRENGTH AND THOUGHT IT INADEQUATE TO THE ATTEMPT NOT IN NUMBERS THESE WERE NOT SO UNEQUAL BUT IN QUALITY
IN ORDER TO TAKE IN THE SUBURB TO DO WHICH HE HAD PULLED DOWN PART OF THE ORIGINAL WALL AND MADE IT ALL ONE CITY TO THIS POINT PASITELIDAS THE LACEDAEMONIAN COMMANDER
WHOM THE ATHENIANS FORTHWITH LODGED IN THE NEIGHBOURING ISLANDS OF THEIR EMPIRE THE ATHENIANS ALSO MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE ISLE OF MELOS WITH THIRTY SHIPS OF THEIR OWN
THINKING THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE AGAIN SUCH A CHANCE OF CATCHING THEM ALONE IF THEIR REINFORCEMENTS WERE ONCE ALLOWED TO COME UP AND SO CALLING ALL HIS SOLDIERS TOGETHER IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND EXPLAIN HIS INTENTION SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
REMAINED TO ARRANGE MATTERS AT AMPHIPOLIS
WHICH WAS INDEED THE ONLY WAY PRACTICABLE THIS HOWEVER NOT BEING QUICK ENOUGH FOR HIM HE JOINED THE RETREAT IN PERSON AND MADE THE RIGHT WING WHEEL ROUND THUS TURNING ITS UNARMED SIDE TO THE ENEMY
NOR INDEED WOULD THEY HAVE DONE SO NOW IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN PRESSED BY A WAR WITH THE HIPPONIANS AND MEDMAEANS WHO LIVED ON THEIR BORDER AND WERE COLONISTS OF THEIRS PHAEAX MEANWHILE
AND FIRST TELL US IF THIS PROPOSITION OF OURS SUITS YOU THE MELIAN COMMISSIONERS ANSWERED MELIANS TO THE FAIRNESS OF QUIETLY INSTRUCTING EACH OTHER AS YOU PROPOSE
THEY WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE OF THE ALLIES WHO WHEN THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE SICILIANS TOOK PLACE HAD NOT MADE PEACE WITH HER
FIRST TOUCHING AT THE STILL BESIEGED SCIONE AND TAKING SOME HEAVY INFANTRY FROM THE ARMY THERE HE NEXT SAILED INTO COPHOS A HARBOUR IN THE TERRITORY OF TORONE WHICH IS NOT FAR FROM THE TOWN FROM THENCE
WHICH HE HAD BEEN PUT TO TO TO ARM THEM HE THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE LESS CHANCE OF BEATING HIM THAN BY NOT LETTING HIM HAVE A SIGHT OF THEM AND THUS LEARN HOW GOOD A RIGHT HE HAD TO DESPISE THEM
THEY CONSTITUTED HIM THE FOUNDER OF THEIR COLONY AND PULLED DOWN THE HAGNONIC ERECTIONS AND OBLITERATED EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS A MEMORIAL OF HIS HAVING FOUNDED THE PLACE
AND THAT ITS GARRISON WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM BATTLE HE ADVANCED WITH HIS ARMY AGAINST THE TOWN SENDING TEN SHIPS TO SAIL ROUND INTO THE HARBOUR
WHILE THE ATHENIANS TOOK MEASURES TO KEEP BETTER GUARD IN FUTURE SUMMER WAS NOW OVER
AFTER REMAINING QUIET FOR SOME TIME
IS OUR BEST CHANCE OF ESTABLISHING A PANIC AMONG THEM AS A FRESH ASSAILANT HAS ALWAYS MORE TERRORS FOR AN ENEMY THAN THE ONE HE IS IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED WITH SHOW YOURSELF A BRAVE MAN AS A SPARTAN SHOULD
HIS SOLDIERS TIRED OF THEIR INACTIVITY BEGAN ALSO SERIOUSLY TO REFLECT ON THE WEAKNESS AND INCOMPETENCE OF THEIR COMMANDER AND THE SKILL AND VALOUR THAT WOULD BE OPPOSED TO HIM AND ON THEIR OWN ORIGINAL UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCOMPANY HIM
BUT THE ATHENIANS FROM THE SHIPS HAD ALREADY TAKEN TORONE
BUT WE KNOW THAT THE FORTUNE OF WAR IS SOMETIMES MORE IMPARTIAL THAN THE DISPROPORTION OF NUMBERS MIGHT LEAD ONE TO SUPPOSE TO SUBMIT IS TO GIVE OURSELVES OVER TO DESPAIR
WHAT IF YOU WHO SIT THERE WERE TO PURSUE A METHOD MORE CAUTIOUS STILL MAKE NO SET SPEECH YOURSELVES BUT TAKE US UP AT WHATEVER YOU DO NOT LIKE AND SETTLE THAT BEFORE GOING ANY FARTHER
AND OTHER SUCH INVENTIONS THAT DELUDE MEN WITH HOPES TO THEIR DESTRUCTION MELIANS
HIS GUN IN HIS HAND IS GOING TO THE CHASE IN THE DISTANCE A BANYHANN TREE AND A PAGODY MOST LIKELY RESEMBLANCES OF SOME INTERESTING SPOT IN OUR FAMOUS EASTERN POSSESSIONS HOW MUCH FOR THIS LOT COME GENTLEMEN

HIS MANNERS SHE THOUGHT WERE VERY DIGNIFIED THE SET OF HIS IRON GRAY HAIR AND HIS DEEP EYE SOCKETS MADE HIM RESEMBLE THE PORTRAIT OF LOCKE HE HAD THE SPARE FORM AND THE PALE COMPLEXION WHICH BECAME A STUDENT

THOUGH NOT AS SOME PEOPLE PRETENDED MORE CLEVER AND SENSIBLE THAN THE ELDER SISTER HE FELT THAT HE HAD CHOSEN THE ONE WHO WAS IN ALL RESPECTS THE SUPERIOR AND A MAN NATURALLY LIKES TO LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THE BEST
WHEN WORDSWORTH WAS THERE AND I NEVER MET HIM AND I DINED WITH HIM TWENTY YEARS AFTERWARDS AT CARTWRIGHT'S THERE'S AN ODDITY IN THINGS NOW BUT DAVY WAS THERE HE WAS A POET TOO OR

TURNING TO CELIA WHO SAT AT HIS RIGHT HAND I THINK SHE IS SAID CELIA FEELING AFRAID LEST SHE SHOULD SAY SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT PLEASE HER SISTER AND BLUSHING AS PRETTILY AS POSSIBLE ABOVE HER NECKLACE

SHOW TEMPER DOROTHEA IT IS SO PAINFUL IN YOU CELIA THAT YOU WILL LOOK AT HUMAN BEINGS AS IF THEY WERE MERELY ANIMALS WITH A TOILET AND NEVER SEE THE GREAT SOUL IN A MAN'S FACE
NEVER WAS IN ACTION MY DEAR ASK MARTINGALE HE WAS IN SPAIN AIDE DE CAMP TO GENERAL BLAZES HE WAS A VERY KIND OLD MAN MISTER SEDLEY REBECCA SAID I'M REALLY SORRY HE'S GONE WRONG
THE FACT IS HUMAN REASON MAY CARRY YOU A LITTLE TOO FAR OVER THE HEDGE IN FACT IT CARRIED ME A GOOD WAY AT ONE TIME BUT I SAW IT WOULD NOT DO I PULLED UP I PULLED UP IN TIME
HAD LOCKE THOSE TWO WHITE MOLES WITH HAIRS ON THEM OH I DARE SAY WHEN PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN SORT LOOKED AT HIM SAID DOROTHEA WALKING AWAY A LITTLE
AFTER THE FAILURE WAS ON THE RECEIPT OF THE PACKET OF FORKS AND SPOONS WITH THE YOUNG STOCKBROKERS LOVE OVER WHICH HE BURST OUT CRYING LIKE A CHILD BEING GREATLY MORE AFFECTED THAN EVEN HIS WIFE TO WHOM THE PRESENT WAS ADDRESSED EDWARD DALE
WHY SHOULD I MAKE IT BEFORE THE OCCASION CAME IT IS A GOOD COMPARISON THE MATCH IS PERFECT MISS BROOKE WAS CLEARLY FORGETTING HERSELF AND CELIA THOUGHT SO I WONDER YOU
DON'T KEEP ME HERE ALL DAY SOME ONE BID FIVE SHILLINGS
AND MANNERS MUST BE VERY MARKED INDEED BEFORE THEY CEASE TO BE INTERPRETED BY PRECONCEPTIONS EITHER CONFIDENT OR DISTRUSTFUL SHE WAS THOROUGHLY CHARMING TO HIM BUT OF COURSE HE THEORIZED A LITTLE ABOUT HIS ATTACHMENT
IN WHOSE CLEVERNESS HE DELIGHTED WHY NOT A MAN'S MIND WHAT THERE IS OF IT HAS ALWAYS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING MASCULINE
THE HEBREW AIDE DE CAMP IN THE SERVICE OF THE OFFICER AT THE TABLE BID AGAINST THE HEBREW GENTLEMAN EMPLOYED BY THE ELEPHANT PURCHASERS AND A BRISK BATTLE ENSUED OVER THIS LITTLE PIANO THE COMBATANTS BEING GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY MISTER HAMMERDOWN AT LAST
SENT THIS LITTLE SPAR OUT OF THE WRECK WITH THEIR LOVE TO GOOD MISSUS SEDLEY AND WITH RESPECT TO THE PIANO AS IT HAD BEEN AMELIA'S AND AS SHE MIGHT MISS IT AND WANT ONE NOW AND AS CAPTAIN WILLIAM DOBBIN COULD NO MORE PLAY UPON IT THAN HE COULD DANCE ON THE TIGHT ROPE
I SHOULD SIT ON THE INDEPENDENT BENCH AS WILBERFORCE DID AND WORK AT PHILANTHROPY
HE AT THE TABLE LOOKED MORE SURPRISED AND DISCOMPOSED THAN EVER WHEN HE SPIED THIS PAIR AND HIS HEAD SANK INTO HIS MILITARY COLLAR AND HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON THEM SO AS TO AVOID THEM ALTOGETHER
AND READING THE GAZETTE ONE DAY AND COMING UPON THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF LIEUTENANT G OSBORNE TO BE CAPTAIN BY PURCHASE VICE SMITH WHO EXCHANGES RAWDON UTTERED THAT SENTIMENT REGARDING AMELIA'S LOVER WHICH ENDED IN THE VISIT TO RUSSELL SQUARE
CAPTAIN CINQBARS WAS PERFECTLY ENCHANTED WITH HER SKILL IN MAKING PUNCH AND YOUNG LIEUTENANT SPATTERDASH
TURN THE ELEPHANT TO THE CAPTAIN BLOWMAN
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD THINK HORSEMANSHIP WRONG IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD THINK IT WRONG FOR ME OH WHY SAID SIR JAMES IN A TENDER TONE OF REMONSTRANCE
PRETTY THING IS IT NOT SWEET MINIATURE
WHEN SHE WANTED TO GIVE IT ALL TO MISTER CASAUBON NO THAT IS TOO HARD SAID SIR JAMES IN A TONE OF REPROACH THAT SHOWED STRONG INTEREST YOUR SISTER IS GIVEN TO SELF MORTIFICATION IS SHE NOT HE CONTINUED
AND THERE SAW ANOTHER OFFICER WITH A YOUNG LADY ON HIS ARM WHO BOTH APPEARED TO BE HIGHLY AMUSED WITH THE SCENE AND TO WHOM FINALLY
ROARED MISTER HAMMERDOWN PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN ON AN ELEPHANT WHO'LL BID FOR THE GENTLEMAN ON THE ELEPHANT LIFT UP THE PICTURE BLOWMAN AND LET THE COMPANY EXAMINE THIS LOT A LONG PALE MILITARY LOOKING GENTLEMAN
IT HAPPENED THAT THE ORATOR ON THE TABLE WAS EXPATIATING ON THE MERITS OF A PICTURE WHICH HE SOUGHT TO RECOMMEND TO HIS AUDIENCE IT WAS BY NO MEANS SO SELECT OR NUMEROUS A COMPANY AS HAD ATTENDED THE PREVIOUS DAYS OF THE AUCTION
BUT I SAW IT WOULD NOT DO IT LEADS TO EVERYTHING YOU CAN LET NOTHING ALONE NO NO SEE THAT YOUR TENANTS DON'T SELL THEIR STRAW AND THAT KIND OF THING
THESE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HER THE LITTLE DINNERS THE LAUGHING AND CHATTING THE MUSIC AFTERWARDS DELIGHTED ALL WHO PARTICIPATED IN THESE ENJOYMENTS
OF EFFORT AH PIGEON HOLES WILL NOT DO I HAVE TRIED PIGEON HOLES BUT EVERYTHING GETS MIXED IN PIGEON HOLES
THE WIFE CONTINUED SENTIMENTALLY FIVE AND TWENTY GUINEAS WAS MONSTROUSLY DEAR FOR THAT LITTLE PIANO
YOUNG LADIES DON'T UNDERSTAND POLITICAL ECONOMY YOU KNOW SAID MISTER BROOKE SMILING TOWARDS MISTER CASAUBON I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE ALL READING ADAM SMITH THERE IS A BOOK NOW
ABOUT THIS OR THAT WHO COULD HELP HER HUSBAND OUT WITH REASONS
HAS MISTER CASAUBON A GREAT SOUL CELIA WAS NOT WITHOUT A TOUCH OF NAIVE MALICE YES I BELIEVE HE HAS SAID DOROTHEA WITH THE FULL VOICE OF DECISION
THE FAMILIAR HOUSE OF WHICH THE LIGHTS USED TO SHINE SO CHEERFULLY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK OF WHICH THE HALL DOORS OPENED SO READILY
AND GIVE THEM DRAINING TILES YOU KNOW BUT YOUR FANCY FARMING WILL NOT DO THE MOST EXPENSIVE SORT OF WHISTLE YOU CAN BUY YOU MAY AS WELL KEEP A PACK OF HOUNDS
OLD WOMEN AND AMATEURS HAVE INVADED THE UPPER APARTMENTS PINCHING THE BED CURTAINS POKING INTO THE FEATHERS SHAMPOOING THE MATTRESSES AND CLAPPING THE WARDROBE DRAWERS TO AND FRO
IS NOTHING BUT A MAN ON A GRAY ASS LIKE MY OWN WHO CARRIES SOMETHING SHINY ON HIS HEAD JUST SO ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE AND THAT RESPLENDENT OBJECT IS THE HELMET OF MAMBRINO
AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE BLOOMING ENGLISHMAN OF THE RED WHISKERED TYPE REPRESENTED BY SIR JAMES CHETTAM I AM READING THE AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY SAID THIS EXCELLENT BARONET
HOW CHANGED THE HOUSE IS THOUGH THE FRONT IS PATCHED OVER WITH BILLS
I AM READING THAT OF A MORNING YOU KNOW SOUTHEY NO SAID MISTER CASAUBON NOT KEEPING PACE WITH MISTER BROOKE'S IMPETUOUS REASON AND THINKING OF THE BOOK ONLY
THE EXCELLENT DRAWING ROOM FURNITURE BY THE BEST MAKERS THE RARE AND FAMOUS WINES SELECTED REGARDLESS OF COST AND WITH THE WELL KNOWN TASTE OF THE PURCHASER THE RICH AND COMPLETE SET OF FAMILY PLATE HAD BEEN SOLD ON THE PREVIOUS DAYS
WHO COULD ILLUMINATE PRINCIPLE WITH THE WIDEST KNOWLEDGE A MAN WHOSE LEARNING ALMOST AMOUNTED TO A PROOF OF WHATEVER HE BELIEVED DOROTHEA'S INFERENCES MAY SEEM LARGE
MISTER CASAUBON TURNED HIS EYES VERY MARKEDLY ON DOROTHEA WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING AND SEEMED TO OBSERVE HER NEWLY
LET ME HOPE THAT YOU WILL RESCIND THAT RESOLUTION ABOUT THE HORSE MISS BROOKE SAID THE PERSEVERING ADMIRER I ASSURE YOU RIDING IS THE MOST HEALTHY OF EXERCISES I AM AWARE OF IT SAID DOROTHEA COLDLY
I DINED WITH HIM YEARS AGO AT CARTWRIGHT'S AND WORDSWORTH WAS THERE TOO THE POET WORDSWORTH YOU KNOW NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SINGULAR
WANDERING ABOUT THE WORLD AND TRYING MENTALLY TO CONSTRUCT IT AS IT USED TO BE IN SPITE OF RUIN AND CONFUSING CHANGES BUT I FIND IT NECESSARY TO USE THE UTMOST CAUTION ABOUT MY EYESIGHT
AND WE PASS TO THE NEXT LOT O DIVES WHO WOULD EVER HAVE THOUGHT AS WE SAT ROUND THE BROAD TABLE SPARKLING WITH PLATE AND SPOTLESS LINEN
RANSACKED BY BROKERS AND BARGAINERS AND ITS QUIET FAMILY TREASURES GIVEN UP TO PUBLIC DESECRATION AND PLUNDER A MONTH AFTER HER FLIGHT
EVERYTHING WAS PLENTIFUL IN HIS HOUSE BUT READY MONEY
THE LADY SAID TO HER FRIEND WHY RAWDON IT'S CAPTAIN DOBBIN I SUPPOSE BECKY WAS DISCONTENTED WITH THE NEW PIANO HER HUSBAND HAD HIRED FOR HER OR PERHAPS THE PROPRIETORS OF THAT INSTRUMENT HAD FETCHED IT AWAY DECLINING FARTHER CREDIT
AND PRONOUNCE HIM A GOOD NATURED JOVIAL RECKLESS FELLOW
HOWEVER SINCE MISS BROOKE HAD BECOME ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER CASAUBON ABOUT THE VAUDOIS CLERGY SIR JAMES BETOOK HIMSELF TO CELIA
I HAVE LITTLE LEISURE FOR SUCH LITERATURE JUST NOW I HAVE BEEN USING UP MY EYESIGHT ON OLD CHARACTERS LATELY THE FACT IS I WANT A READER FOR MY EVENINGS BUT I AM FASTIDIOUS IN VOICES
IT IS NOT A SIN TO MAKE YOURSELF POOR IN PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS FOR THE GOOD OF ALL SHE SPOKE WITH MORE ENERGY THAN IS EXPECTED OF SO YOUNG A LADY BUT SIR JAMES HAD APPEALED TO HER HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO SO
DOROTHEA QUITE DESPISES SIR JAMES CHETTAM I BELIEVE SHE WOULD NOT ACCEPT HIM CELIA FELT THAT THIS WAS A PITY SHE HAD NEVER BEEN DECEIVED AS TO THE OBJECT OF THE BARONET'S INTEREST SOMETIMES INDEED
HE WAS RATHER DULL PERHAPS BUT WOULD NOT SUCH WINE MAKE ANY CONVERSATION PLEASANT WE MUST GET SOME OF HIS BURGUNDY AT ANY PRICE THE MOURNERS CRY AT HIS CLUB
AND OBSERVED THAT IT WAS A WIDE FIELD YES SAID MISTER BROOKE WITH AN EASY SMILE BUT I HAVE DOCUMENTS I BEGAN A LONG WHILE AGO TO COLLECT DOCUMENTS THEY WANT ARRANGING BUT WHEN A QUESTION HAS STRUCK ME
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY HIDE FROM US HOW WATCHFUL THEY ARE WHEN THEY SEEM MOST ARTLESS AND CONFIDENTIAL HOW OFTEN THOSE FRANK SMILES WHICH THEY WEAR SO EASILY ARE TRAPS TO CAJOLE OR ELUDE OR DISARM
THE JUNIOR OF THE HOUSE WHO PURCHASED THE SPOONS FOR THE FIRM WAS IN FACT VERY SWEET UPON AMELIA AND OFFERED FOR HER IN SPITE OF ALL HE MARRIED MISS LOUISA CUTTS DAUGHTER OF HIGHAM AND CUTTS THE EMINENT CORNFACTORS
I TOOK IN ALL THE NEW IDEAS AT ONE TIME HUMAN PERFECTIBILITY NOW BUT SOME SAY HISTORY MOVES IN CIRCLES AND THAT MAY BE VERY WELL ARGUED I HAVE ARGUED IT MYSELF
AS I MAY SAY WORDSWORTH WAS POET ONE AND DAVY WAS POET TWO THAT WAS TRUE IN EVERY SENSE YOU KNOW DOROTHEA FELT A LITTLE MORE UNEASY THAN USUAL
MUSWELL HILL BUT WE MUST NOT LET THE RECOLLECTIONS OF THIS GOOD FELLOW CAUSE US TO DIVERGE FROM THE PRINCIPAL HISTORY
OR COAX THE FURY OF A SAVAGE ONE WE ACCEPT THIS AMIABLE SLAVISHNESS AND PRAISE A WOMAN FOR IT WE CALL THIS PRETTY TREACHERY TRUTH A GOOD HOUSEWIFE IS OF NECESSITY A HUMBUG AND CORNELIA'S HUSBAND WAS HOODWINKED
EVERYTHING I SEE IN HIM CORRESPONDS TO HIS PAMPHLET ON BIBLICAL COSMOLOGY HE TALKS VERY LITTLE SAID CELIA THERE IS NO ONE FOR HIM TO TALK TO CELIA THOUGHT PRIVATELY
OR NOT TALKED ABOUT AT ALL HE LIVED COMFORTABLY ON CREDIT HE HAD A LARGE CAPITAL OF DEBTS WHICH LAID OUT JUDICIOUSLY WILL CARRY A MAN ALONG FOR MANY YEARS AND ON WHICH CERTAIN MEN ABOUT TOWN CONTRIVE TO LIVE A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER THAN EVEN MEN WITH READY MONEY CAN DO
EVEN WITH THE MOST SELFISH DISPOSITION THE VANITY FAIRIAN
THERE WAS A GENERAL GIGGLE IN THE ROOM DON'T BE TRYING TO DEPRECATE THE VALUE OF THE LOT MISTER MOSS MISTER HAMMERDOWN SAID LET THE COMPANY EXAMINE IT AS A WORK OF ART
AS TO THE EXCESSIVE RELIGIOUSNESS ALLEGED AGAINST MISS BROOKE HE HAD A VERY INDEFINITE NOTION OF WHAT IT CONSISTED IN AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD DIE OUT WITH MARRIAGE IN SHORT
BLUSHING IN A VERY HURRIED AND DISCOMFITED MANNER TURNED AWAY HIS HEAD SHALL WE SAY TWENTY GUINEAS FOR THIS WORK OF ART FIFTEEN FIVE NAME YOUR OWN PRICE THE GENTLEMAN WITHOUT THE ELEPHANT IS WORTH FIVE POUND
AND THE IRISH WIDOW CONSOLED AND FLATTERED HIM AS USUAL HIS PRESENT OF MONEY NEEDFUL AS IT WAS MADE LITTLE IMPRESSION ON HIS PARENTS
AND SPOKE WITH COLD BRUSQUERIE VERY MUCH WITH THE AIR OF A HANDSOME BOY IN AMUSING CONTRAST WITH THE SOLICITOUS AMIABILITY OF HER ADMIRER I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR REASONS FOR THIS CRUEL RESOLUTION
AND HOW COURTEOUS AND FRIENDLY MEN WHO SLANDERED AND HATED EACH OTHER EVERYWHERE ELSE
I AM SURE HER REASONS WOULD DO HER HONOR HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST JEALOUS OF THE INTEREST WITH WHICH DOROTHEA HAD LOOKED UP AT MISTER CASAUBON IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT A GIRL TO WHOM HE WAS MEDITATING AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE
CERTAIN OF THE BEST WINES WHICH ALL HAD A GREAT CHARACTER AMONG AMATEURS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD BEEN PURCHASED FOR HIS MASTER WHO KNEW THEM VERY WELL BY THE BUTLER OF OUR FRIEND JOHN OSBORNE ESQUIRE OF RUSSELL SQUARE
WHO REWARDED HIM WITH A KISS BY WAY OF REPLY AND WAS INDEED NOT A LITTLE GRATIFIED BY THE GENEROUS CONFIDENCE OF HER HUSBAND
HOW VERY UGLY MISTER CASAUBON IS CELIA HE IS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED LOOKING MEN I EVER SAW HE IS REMARKABLY LIKE THE PORTRAIT OF LOCKE HE HAS THE SAME DEEP EYE SOCKETS
AND LIVING ON WHO KNOWS WHAT WE SEE JACK THRIFTLESS PRANCING IN THE PARK OR DARTING IN HIS BROUGHAM DOWN PALL MALL WE EAT HIS DINNERS SERVED ON HIS MIRACULOUS PLATE HOW DID THIS BEGIN WE SAY OR WHERE WILL IT END
AND I CANNOT ENDURE LISTENING TO AN IMPERFECT READER IT IS A MISFORTUNE IN SOME SENSES I FEED TOO MUCH ON THE INWARD SOURCES I LIVE TOO MUCH WITH THE DEAD MY MIND IS SOMETHING LIKE THE GHOST OF AN ANCIENT
GREAT MISTAKE CHETTAM INTERPOSED MISTER BROOKE GOING INTO ELECTRIFYING YOUR LAND AND THAT KIND OF THING AND MAKING A PARLOR OF YOUR COW HOUSE IT WON'T DO I WENT INTO SCIENCE A GREAT DEAL MYSELF AT ONE TIME
BUT THERE MAY BE GOOD REASONS FOR CHOOSING NOT TO DO WHAT IS VERY AGREEABLE SAID DOROTHEA MISTER BROOKE WAS SPEAKING AT THE SAME TIME BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MISTER CASAUBON WAS OBSERVING DOROTHEA AND SHE WAS AWARE OF IT
LAUGHABLE AND TEARFUL WHERE YOU MAY BE GENTLE AND PATHETIC OR SAVAGE AND CYNICAL WITH PERFECT PROPRIETY IT IS AT ONE OF THOSE PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES A CROWD OF WHICH ARE ADVERTISED EVERY DAY IN THE LAST PAGE OF THE TIMES NEWSPAPER
DO YOU KNOW WILBERFORCE MISTER CASAUBON SAID NO WELL WILBERFORCE WAS PERHAPS NOT ENOUGH OF A THINKER BUT IF I WENT INTO PARLIAMENT
SHE HAD REFLECTED THAT DODO WOULD PERHAPS NOT MAKE A HUSBAND HAPPY WHO HAD NOT HER WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND STIFLED IN THE DEPTHS OF HER HEART WAS THE FEELING THAT HER SISTER WAS TOO RELIGIOUS FOR FAMILY COMFORT NOTIONS AND SCRUPLES WERE LIKE SPILT NEEDLES
I MADE A GREAT STUDY OF THEOLOGY AT ONE TIME SAID MISTER BROOKE AS IF TO EXPLAIN THE INSIGHT JUST MANIFESTED I KNOW SOMETHING OF ALL SCHOOLS I KNEW WILBERFORCE IN HIS BEST DAYS
HIS CHOICE OF A MESSENGER WAS SHREWD THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR WAS OF ALL MEN THE MOST ANXIOUS FOR THE DELIVERANCE OF HIS CITY THE ONE MAN WHO ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT WOULD PLEAD MOST FERVENTLY FOR ITS PRESERVATION AT ALL COSTS
THIS FORT THE ADMIRAL IN THOSE DAYS OF WAITING HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION SECRETLY TO GARRISON AND REARM FOR THE PURPOSE HE HAD STRIPPED THE FORT OF COJERO FARTHER OUT ON THE GULF OF ITS ENTIRE ARMAMENT
FOLLOWED BY GUARDS HIS MOMENTARY TRUCULENCE UTTERLY SPENT BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DEPARTED THAN UP LEAPT CAHUSAC
AGAIN I WARN CAPTAIN BLOOD IT IS A TRAP I SAY WE ARE TO COME ON ALWAYS TO COME ON WITHOUT OPPOSITION UNTIL WE FIND THAT IT IS TOO LATE TO GO TO SEA AGAIN THAT WE CANNOT GO BACK AT ALL
IN A SPACIOUS AND LUXURIANT GARDEN TO THE EAST OF CAYONA THE CAPTAIN BECAME A VERY WELCOME GUEST
THAT WAS THE MESSAGE HE RECEIVED FROM THEM THAT SAME EVENING BY THE SULLEN MOUTH OF CAHUSAC HIMSELF HE WELCOMED IT AND INVITED THE BRETON TO SIT DOWN AND JOIN THE COUNCIL WHICH WAS EVEN THEN DELIBERATING UPON THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED
SAILED INTO THE GREAT LAKE OF MARACAYBO AND EFFECTED ITS RAID UPON THAT OPULENT CITY OF THE MAIN THE AFFAIR DID NOT PROCEED EXACTLY AS WAS HOPED AND BLOOD'S FORCE CAME TO FIND ITSELF IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION
IN GETTING CANOES TO BRING OFF YOUR MEN AND YOUR GEAR THOSE THREE DAYS GAVE THE FOLK AT GIBRALTAR NOT ONLY TIME TO HEAR OF OUR COMING BUT TIME IN WHICH TO GET AWAY AFTER THAT AND BECAUSE OF IT WE HAD TO FOLLOW THE GOVERNOR TO HIS INFERNAL ISLAND FORTRESS
AND THE STILL EVENING AIR WAS HEAVY WITH THE SCENT OF THEM IT WAS ONE OF THOSE PLEASANT EXTERIOR INTERIORS WHICH MOORISH ARCHITECTS HAD INTRODUCED TO SPAIN AND THE SPANIARDS HAD CARRIED WITH THEM TO THE NEW WORLD
THAT CAPTAIN BLOOD WAS LIKELY TO AFFORD HIM HE REMEMBERED THE FATE OF LEVASSEUR SO HE CONFINED HIMSELF TO WORDS IT IS TOO MUCH YOU GO TOO FAR HE COMPLAINED BITTERLY LOOK YOU CAHUSAC
IN THE ALREADY CORDIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN CAPTAIN BLOOD AND THE GOVERNOR OF TORTUGA AT THE FINE STONE HOUSE WITH ITS GREEN JALOUSIED WINDOWS
IN PUREST CASTILIAN TO DON MIGUEL I HAVE SHOWN YOUR EXCELLENCY THIS MORNING OF WHAT I AM CAPABLE HE WROTE ALTHOUGH OUTNUMBERED BY MORE THAN TWO TO ONE IN MEN IN SHIPS AND IN GUNS
THE CATS THEY WAIT FOR US THE CATS ARE THOSE FOUR SPANISH SHIPS OF WAR THAT HAVE COME MEANTIME AND THEY WAIT FOR US OUTSIDE THE BOTTLE NECK OF THIS LAGOON
THIS IS BEST EXPLAINED IN THE WORDS EMPLOYED BY CAHUSAC WHICH PITT HAS CAREFULLY RECORDED IN THE COURSE OF AN ALTERCATION THAT BROKE OUT
WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD HAD APPROPRIATED TO HIS OWN USES A CLOISTERED STONE QUADRANGLE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH A FOUNTAIN PLAYED COOLLY UNDER A TRELLIS OF VINE ORANGE TREES GREW ON TWO SIDES OF IT
HE HAD IT IN THE PESSIMISM OF WHICH CAHUSAC DID NOT ECONOMIZE EXPRESSIONS TRANSPORTED AT FIRST TO HEIGHTS OF DIZZY SATISFACTION BY THE SWIFT AND EASY VICTORY OF THEIR INFERIOR FORCE THAT MORNING
YE SHALL HAVE THE SLOOP AS A PARTING GIFT FROM US AND YE CAN JOIN DON MIGUEL IN THE FORT FOR ALL I CARE OR FOR ALL THE GOOD YE'RE LIKELY TO BE TO US IN THIS PRESENT PASS IT IS TO MY MEN TO DECIDE CAHUSAC RETORTED SWALLOWING HIS FURY
HE CHECKED OUT OF THE CHURCH AT THAT MOMENT GRAND AIR AND ALL SAUNTERED PETER BLOOD WITH HIM CAME A TOUGH LONG LEGGED FRENCH SEA WOLF NAMED YBERVILLE
THUS LIGHTENED AND LISTING NOW TO STARBOARD HE FETCHED HER ABOUT
DON DIEGO AND WITH HIM SAILED HIS NEPHEW ESTEBAN WHOSE VINDICTIVE ZEAL EXCEEDED THE ADMIRAL'S OWN YET KNOWING ALL THIS CAPTAIN BLOOD COULD PRESERVE HIS CALM IN REPROVING THE COWARDLY FRENZY OF ONE FOR WHOM THE SITUATION
WAS ALMOST AS SORELY DAMAGED BY THE FIRE SHE HAD SUSTAINED FROM THE BUCCANEERS BEFORE SURRENDERING CLEARLY THEN HE WAS COMPELLED TO ADMIT IN THE END THAT NOTHING REMAINED
TURBAN WISE ABOUT HIS HEAD IS IT THAT I HAVE NOT WARNED YOU FROM THE BEGINNING THAT ALL WAS TOO EASY HE DEMANDED BETWEEN PLAINTIVENESS AND FURY I AM NO FOOL MY FRIENDS
LET CAPTAIN BLOOD DO HIS WORST AT MARACAYBO THERE SHOULD BE A BITTER RECKONING FOR HIM WHEN EVENTUALLY HE DECIDED AS SOONER OR LATER DECIDE HE MUST TO COME FORTH THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR WAS FLUNG INTO PANIC HE LOST HIS TEMPER
I AM LOOKING AT IT SAID CAHUSAC PISH
INTENT ABOVE ALL UPON SAVING THIS FROM FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF THE PIRATES DON MIGUEL WHO WITH A REMNANT OF HIS CREW HAD MEANWHILE TRANSFERRED HIMSELF ABOARD HER HEADED HER DOWN TOWARDS PALOMAS AND THE FORT THAT GUARDED THE PASSAGE
SENDING THEM BACK IN THE CANOES WHICH WE SHALL TAKE WITH US FOR THAT PURPOSE IF YOUR EXCELLENCY SHOULD BE SO ILL ADVISED AS TO REFUSE THESE TERMS AND THEREBY IMPOSE UPON ME THE NECESSITY
THE DISPUTE WAS BEING CONDUCTED BY HAGTHORPE WOLVERSTONE AND PITT ON THE ONE SIDE AND CAHUSAC OUT OF WHOSE UNEASINESS IT ALL AROSE ON THE OTHER BEHIND THEM IN THE SUN SCORCHED DUSTY SQUARE
THE NEAREST GAPING SCUTTLE INTO THE HOLD AND THEREUPON DIVED OVERBOARD IN HIS TURN TO BE PICKED UP PRESENTLY BY THE LONGBOAT FROM THE ARABELLA BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENED THE SLOOP WAS A THING OF FIRE FROM WHICH EXPLOSIONS WERE HURLING BLAZING COMBUSTIBLES
EMOTIONS WHICH WILL RENDER UNREASONABLE THE MOST REASONABLE OF MEN WITH RETURNING CALM HE SURVEYED THE SITUATION
I WILL SPARE THIS CITY OF MARACAYBO AND FORTHWITH EVACUATE IT LEAVING BEHIND ME THE FORTY PRISONERS I HAVE TAKEN IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR PAYING ME THE SUM OF FIFTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT
SO WEARY ME NO MORE WITH YOUR COWARD COUNSELS I MAKE NO TERMS WITH CAPTAIN BLOOD I KNOW MY DUTY TO MY KING AND I INTEND TO PERFORM IT I ALSO KNOW MY DUTY TO MYSELF I HAVE A PRIVATE SCORE WITH THIS RASCAL
THEN HAVING CONTROLLED HIMSELF
THE FRENCHMAN WAS NOW PLUNGED BACK AND MORE DEEPLY THAN EVER INTO THE ABYSS OF HOPELESSNESS AND HIS MOOD INFECTED AT LEAST THE MAIN BODY OF HIS OWN FOLLOWERS IT IS THE END HE TOLD CAPTAIN BLOOD THIS TIME WE ARE CHECKMATED
THE BUCCANEERS LABOURED AND SWEATED TO COMPLETE THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE ACTION THAT WAS TO PROCURE THEM THEIR DELIVERANCE TIME PRESSED THEY MUST STRIKE BEFORE DON MIGUEL DE ESPINOSA
WHO THOUGH STILL YOUNG HAD ALREADY WON FAME AS A PRIVATEER COMMANDER BEFORE THE LOSS OF HIS OWN SHIP HAD DRIVEN HIM TO TAKE SERVICE UNDER BLOOD THE CAPTAIN ADVANCED TOWARDS THAT DISPUTING GROUP
FROM WHAT HAS OCCURRED YOU MAY JUDGE OF WHAT MUST OCCUR I SHOULD NOT TROUBLE YOUR EXCELLENCY WITH THIS LETTER BUT THAT I AM A HUMANE MAN ABHORRING BLOODSHED THEREFORE
BEDAD THEY KNEW THEIR WORLD THE OLD ROMANS HE BREATHED INTO HIS COMPANIONS AND EVEN INTO CAHUSAC SOME OF HIS OWN SPIRIT OF CONFIDENCE AND IN CONFIDENCE ALL WENT BUSILY TO WORK FOR THREE DAYS FROM SUNRISE TO SUNSET
BUT SUCH WAS THE DAMAGE SHE HERSELF SUSTAINED THAT PRESENTLY COMING UNDER THE GUNS OF THE FORT SHE BEGAN TO SINK AND FINALLY SETTLED DOWN IN THE SHALLOWS WITH PART OF HER HULL ABOVE WATER THENCE SOME IN BOATS AND SOME BY SWIMMING
EVEN CAHUSAC'S FRENCH FOLLOWERS WERE CARRIED OFF THEIR FEET BY THAT WAVE OF JOCULAR ENTHUSIASM UNTIL IN HIS TRUCULENT OBSTINACY CAHUSAC REMAINED THE ONLY DISSENTIENT HE WITHDREW IN MORTIFICATION
OFFERED MUCH RESISTANCE THE SIGHT OF THEIR ADMIRAL IN FLAMES AND THE SALVADOR DRIFTING CRIPPLED FROM THE ACTION HAD SO UTTERLY DISHEARTENED THEM THAT THEY ACCOUNTED THEMSELVES VANQUISHED AND LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS IF BY A RESOLUTE STAND THE SALVADOR
THAT STIRRED THROUGH THE PURPLE DARKNESS OF THE TROPICAL NIGHT
SHE WAS FOLLOWED AT A DISTANCE BY THE ELIZABETH COMMANDED BY HAGTHORPE WITH WHOM WAS THE NOW SHIPLESS CAHUSAC AND THE BULK OF HIS FRENCH FOLLOWERS
AND WHAT IS MORE THEY'VE SUCCEEDED
HE SPOKE WITH A RESTRAINT WHICH I TRUST YOU WILL AGREE WAS ADMIRABLE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THE SPANISH FLEET GUARDING THE BOTTLE NECK EXIT OF THE GREAT LAKE OF MARACAYBO AND AWAITING THERE THE COMING FORTH OF CAPTAIN BLOOD
WHICH WAS HIS OWN TO LOSE THIS PLEASANT CITY OF MARACAYBO ISN'T SO NO DOUBT HE'LL LOSE IT WITH FEWER MISGIVINGS I AM SORRY WASTE LIKE BLOODSHED IS A THING ABHORRENT TO ME BUT THERE YE ARE
THE ADMIRAL OF SPAIN IN ADDITION TO HIS DUTY TO HIS COUNTRY THE ADMIRAL HAD AS YOU KNOW A FURTHER PERSONAL INCENTIVE ARISING OUT OF THAT BUSINESS ABOARD THE ENCARNACION A YEAR AGO AND THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER
THE MOOD OF THE MEN ENHEARTENED HIM YOU THINK PERHAPS THIS YOUR CAPTAIN BLOOD IS THE GOOD GOD THAT HE CAN MAKE MIRACLES EH HE IS RIDICULOUS YOU KNOW THIS CAPTAIN BLOOD WITH HIS GRAND AIR AND HIS
BLOOD HAD SAILED IN TO OPEN FIRE UPON THE SALVADOR FIRST ATHWART HER HAWSE HE HAD LOOSED A BROADSIDE THAT HAD SWEPT HER DECKS WITH TERRIFIC EFFECT THEN GOING ON AND ABOUT
WHICH DID THEM HOWEVER LITTLE FURTHER DAMAGE OUT OF RANGE AT LAST THEY LAY TO
HE WOULD SO SOON AS HE WAS REENFORCED BY A FIFTH SHIP THE SANTO NINO ON ITS WAY TO JOIN HIM FROM LA GUAYRA HIMSELF COME INSIDE TO SEEK THEM AT MARACAYBO THIS TIME CAPTAIN BLOOD WAS PUT OUT OF TEMPER
BEFORE PROCEEDING TO DEAL WITH YOUR FORT WHICH YOU MAY DEEM INVINCIBLE AS I HAVE DEALT ALREADY WITH YOUR FLEET WHICH YOU DEEMED INVINCIBLE I MAKE YOU PURELY OUT OF HUMANITARIAN CONSIDERATIONS THIS LAST OFFER OF TERMS
AND SAID SOME HARD THINGS TO THE ADMIRAL BUT THEY WERE NOT AS HARD AS THE THING THE ADMIRAL SAID TO HIM IN ANSWER HAD YOU BEEN AS LOYAL TO YOUR KING IN HINDERING THE ENTRANCE OF THESE CURSED PIRATES
HIS SIX MEN STOOD AT THEIR POSTS ON THE LARBOARD SIDE STARK NAKED EACH ARMED WITH A GRAPNEL FOUR OF THEM ON THE GUNWALE TWO OF THEM ALOFT AT THE MOMENT OF IMPACT THESE GRAPNELS WERE SLUNG TO BIND THE SPANIARD TO THEM
AND LONG TONGUES OF FLAME WERE LICKING OUT TO CONSUME THE GALLEON BEATING BACK THOSE DARING SPANIARDS WHO TOO LATE
AND ONE HUNDRED HEAD OF CATTLE AS A RANSOM THEREAFTER GRANTING ME UNMOLESTED PASSAGE OF THE BAR MY PRISONERS MOST OF WHOM ARE PERSONS OF CONSIDERATION I WILL RETAIN AS HOSTAGES UNTIL AFTER MY DEPARTURE
WHICH INCLUDED SOME CANNON ROYAL OF MORE THAN ORDINARY RANGE AND POWER WITH NO SUSPICION OF THIS CAPTAIN BLOOD GAVE CHASE ACCOMPANIED BY THE INFANTA WHICH WAS MANNED NOW BY A PRIZE CREW UNDER THE COMMAND OF YBERVILLE
AND CONCEIVING THEMSELVES ON THE POINT OF BEING BOARDED THE SPANIARDS STOOD TO ARMS TO WARD OFF THE ONSLAUGHT ITS SLOWNESS IN COMING INTRIGUED THEM
ALTHOUGH HIT BY ONE SHOT ONLY THIS HAD CRUSHED HER LARBOARD TIMBERS ON THE WATERLINE STARTING A LEAK THAT MUST PRESENTLY HAVE FILLED HER BUT FOR THE PROMPT ACTION OF THE EXPERIENCED YBERVILLE IN ORDERING HER LARBOARD GUNS TO BE FLUNG OVERBOARD
SHOULD AFTERWARDS CONTRIVE TO GET AWAY UNSCATHED AND FROM THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF HIS RESOURCEFULNESS THE THING HOWEVER UNLIKELY NEED NOT BE IMPOSSIBLE HE MUST PROFIT BY THAT WHICH THEY NOW RELINQUISHED THIS WAS A CONTINGENCY TOO BITTER FOR CONTEMPLATION
FROM THE FATE WITH WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD WAS THREATENING IT AND AS HE RECKONED SO IT BEFELL THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR ADDED HIS OWN PASSIONATE PLEADING TO THE PROPOSALS OF THE LETTER BUT DON MIGUEL WAS OF STOUTER HEART
BUT NO ONE WILL LISTEN TO ME YOU ALL KNOW SO MUCH MORE NAME OF GOD CAPTAIN BLOOD HE WILL GO ON AND WE GO ON WE GO TO GIBRALTAR TRUE THAT AT LAST AFTER LONG TIME WE CATCH THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR
THERE TO REFIT THE SHIPS BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO FORCE THE PASSAGE AND SO BACK TO MARACAYBO CAME THOSE DEFEATED VICTORS OF THAT SHORT TERRIBLE FIGHT AND IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN WANTING FURTHER TO EXASPERATE THEIR LEADER
BUT SINCE YE'RE SO DESPERATELY CONCERNED TO SAVE YOUR SKIN YOU AND THOSE THAT THINK LIKE YOU ARE WELCOME TO LEAVE US I'VE NO DOUBT AT ALL THE SPANISH ADMIRAL WILL WELCOME THE ABATEMENT OF OUR NUMBERS
COMPLACENTLY HE PULLED AT A PIPE THAT WAS LOADED WITH THAT FRAGRANT SACERDOTES TOBACCO FOR WHICH GIBRALTAR WAS FAMOUS AND OF WHICH
AND THE ALMOST FOPPISH DAINTINESS OF JEREMY PITT HIS SOILED AND BLOOD STAINED SHIRT OF BLUE COTTON WAS OPEN IN FRONT TO COOL HIS HAIRY BREAST AND THE GIRDLE ABOUT THE WAIST OF HIS LEATHER BREECHES
WITH A SKILL OF WHICH HE MIGHT JUSTLY BE PROUD HAVING DESTROYED A FORCE SO SUPERIOR IN SHIPS AND GUNS AND MEN THAT DON MIGUEL DE ESPINOSA HAD JUSTIFIABLY DEEMED IT OVERWHELMING
ROUND FROM LA GUAYRA BY A GUARDA COSTA AND IF YE HADN'T LOST LA FOUDRE AND SO REDUCED OUR FLEET FROM THREE SHIPS TO TWO WE SHOULD EVEN NOW BE ABLE TO FIGHT OUR WAY THROUGH WITH A REASONABLE HOPE OF SUCCEEDING YET YOU THINK IT IS FOR YOU TO COME HECTORING HERE
NOURISHED BY A SCORE OF RIVERS FROM THE SNOW CAPPED RANGES THAT SURROUND IT ON TWO SIDES IS SOME HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES IN LENGTH AND ALMOST THE SAME DISTANCE ACROSS AT ITS WIDEST IT IS AS HAS BEEN INDICATED IN THE SHAPE OF A GREAT BOTTLE
PRECISELY WHAT ANSWER HAVE YOU MAKE TO THE ADMIRAL A SMILE IRRADIATED THE FACE AND EYES OF CAPTAIN BLOOD I HAVE ANSWERED HIM THAT UNLESS WITHIN FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS WE HAVE HIS PAROLE TO STAND OUT TO SEA
WHAT DO WE FIND A CITY ABANDONED LIKE THE FORT A CITY OUT OF WHICH
THOUGH SMALLER VESSELS WERE STILL FORMIDABLE ENOUGH WITH THEIR TWENTY GUNS AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN APIECE SUCH WAS THE FLEET OF WHICH THE GAUNTLET WAS TO BE RUN BY CAPTAIN BLOOD
YOUR FOOL LETTER IT HAVE SEAL THE DOOM OF US ALL HAVE YE DONE QUOTH BLOOD QUIETLY AS THE FRENCHMAN PAUSED FOR BREATH NO I HAVE NOT THEN SPARE ME THE REST IT'LL BE OF THE SAME QUALITY DEVIL A DOUBT
THE IMPUDENCE OF IT LEFT CAHUSAC SPEECHLESS
HE HAD PUT A SECOND BROADSIDE INTO HER HULL AT SHORT RANGE LEAVING HER THUS HALF CRIPPLED TEMPORARILY AT LEAST AND KEEPING TO HIS COURSE HE HAD BEWILDERED THE CREW OF THE INFANTA BY A COUPLE OF SHOTS FROM THE CHASERS ON HIS BEAK HEAD
TROUBLE ME NO MORE HE SNAPPED AT CAHUSAC WHO CAME GROWLING TO HIM AGAIN SEND WORD TO DON MIGUEL
OF REDUCING YOUR FORT AT THE COST OF SOME LIVES I WARN YOU THAT YOU MAY EXPECT NO QUARTER FROM US AND THAT I SHALL BEGIN BY LEAVING A HEAP OF ASHES WHERE THIS PLEASANT CITY OF MARACAYBO NOW STANDS THE LETTER WRITTEN
HE BADE THEM BRING HIM FROM AMONG THE PRISONERS THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF MARACAYBO WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AT GIBRALTAR DISCLOSING ITS CONTENTS TO HIM HE DESPATCHED HIM WITH IT TO DON MIGUEL
WHO MANNED THESE BOATS IN ADDITION TO THE TWO FELLOWS WHO WERE TO SAIL THEM THEIR PLACE WAS TO BE IN THE REAR
RESTING LIGHTLY ON THE PUMMEL CORRECTED THE IMPRESSION THAT AND THOSE STEELY EYES OF HIS ANNOUNCED THE ADVENTURER YOU FIND ME RIDICULOUS EH CAHUSAC SAID HE AS HE CAME TO A HALT
AND SOME EIGHT CANOES ABOARD OF WHICH HAD BEEN SHIPPED THE PRISONERS THE SLAVES AND MOST OF THE CAPTURED MERCHANDISE THE PRISONERS WERE ALL PINIONED AND GUARDED BY FOUR BUCCANEERS WITH MUSKETOONS
NOR WAS HE TO BE MOLLIFIED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY BROUGHT HIM HIS REVENGE THIS CAME IN THE SHAPE OF A MESSENGER FROM DON MIGUEL WITH A LETTER IN WHICH THE SPANISH ADMIRAL SOLEMNLY VOWED TO GOD THAT
WHAT THEN MUST I FIND YOU HE SPOKE QUIETLY ALMOST WEARILY
THIS HE NOW PROVED IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY AND UNDER HIS POWERFUL PROTECTION THE CREDIT OF CAPTAIN BLOOD AMONG THE BUCCANEERS VERY RAPIDLY REACHED ITS ZENITH SO WHEN IT CAME TO FITTING OUT HIS FLEET
BUT WHOSE IS THE FAULT OF THAT DELAY WE HAVE BEEN A MONTH IN DOING WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE
TRUE HIS FLEET HAD BEEN PARTLY DESTROYED AND PARTLY CAPTURED BUT THEN HE ARGUED HE HAD BEEN TAKEN UTTERLY BY SURPRISE THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN THERE SHOULD BE NO SURPRISING THE FORT
JUST AS THE SLIGHT VESSEL WENT CRASHING AND BUMPING AND SCRAPING AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE FLAGSHIP WHILST RIGGING BECAME TANGLED WITH RIGGING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE YOU WOULD NOT BE PILOTED YOU KNEW YOUR WAY
HAD ENCOURAGED THE OTHER TWO UNDAMAGED VESSELS TO RESISTANCE THE SPANIARDS MIGHT WELL HAVE RETRIEVED THE FORTUNES OF THE DAY BUT IT HAPPENED THAT THE SALVADOR WAS HANDICAPPED IN TRUE SPANISH FASHION BY BEING THE TREASURE SHIP OF THE FLEET
FOR WITH ME THINGS ARE NEVER SMOOTH AND EASY AND THAT I THINK IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU THIS MORNING CAHUSAC FLUNG AWAY CURSING AND WENT TO TAKE THE FEELING OF HIS MEN CAPTAIN BLOOD WENT OFF TO GIVE HIS SURGEON'S SKILL TO THE WOUNDED
I'LL HAVE THE FAGGOTS TO THE PLACE IN THE MORNING AND MAYBE WHEN HE SEES THE BLAZE TO MORROW NIGHT HE'LL BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT PETER BLOOD IS A MAN OF HIS WORD YE MAY GO DON FRANCISCO THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR WENT OUT WITH DRAGGING FEET
SURE NOW THERE'S NO QUESTION AT ALL SAID CAPTAIN BLOOD INDEED BUT THERE IS CAHUSAC INSISTED DON MIGUEL THE SPANISH ADMIRAL HAVE OFFER US SAFE PASSAGE TO SEA IF WE WILL DEPART AT ONCE DO NO DAMAGE TO THE TOWN
WISH TO AVAIL YOURSELVES OF THE SPANIARD'S TERMS WE SHALL NOT HINDER YOU
AND SO SWIFT AND PARALYZING HAD BEEN BLOOD'S STROKE BOARDED NOW AND FACED BY THE COLD STEEL OF THE BUCCANEERS
WOLVERSTONE LAUGHED CAHUSAC EXPLODED IN FURY
LEAVING THE OTHERS TO DELIBERATE IN PEACE NEXT MORNING EARLY HE SOUGHT CAPTAIN BLOOD AGAIN HE FOUND HIM ALONE IN THE PATIO PACING TO AND FRO HIS HEAD SUNK ON HIS BREAST CAHUSAC
IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THEY USED A VIGILANCE KEENER THAN THEIR CARELESS HABIT CERTAIN IT IS THAT THEY DID NOT SIGHT BLOOD'S FLEET IN THAT DIM LIGHT
HERE THAT COUNCIL OF WAR COMPOSED OF SIX MEN IN ALL DELIBERATED UNTIL LATE THAT NIGHT UPON THE PLAN OF ACTION WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD PUT FORWARD THE GREAT FRESHWATER LAKE OF MARACAYBO
WE SAIL AT ONCE BON VOYAGE SAID CAPTAIN BLOOD
DON MIGUEL WILL WELCOME YOUR DECISION YOU MAY BE SURE
PITT TELLS US A DREADFUL KIND OF ENGLISH WHICH THE SHIPMASTER HOWEVER MAKES LITTLE ATTEMPT TO REPRODUCE HIS DRESS WAS AS DISCORDANT AS HIS SPEECH IT WAS OF A KIND TO ADVERTISE HIS TRADE
ABOARD THE RUDELY AWAKENED GALLEON ALL WAS CONFUSED HURRYING SCURRYING TRUMPETING AND SHOUTING AT FIRST THERE HAD BEEN A DESPERATELY HURRIED ATTEMPT TO GET UP THE ANCHOR BUT THIS WAS ABANDONED AS BEING ALREADY TOO LATE
YOU CALL ME A COWARD I'LL TAKE THAT LIBERTY THE BRETON GLARED AT HIM BREATHING HARD BUT HE HAD NO MIND TO ASK SATISFACTION FOR THE INSULT HE KNEW TOO WELL THE KIND OF SATISFACTION
BEHIND ENHEARTENED HIM YOU HAVE REFUSE YOU HAVE REFUSE ALREADY AND WITHOUT CONSULTING ME
THEN CRASHED ALONGSIDE TO GRAPPLE AND BOARD HER WHILST HAGTHORPE WAS DOING THE LIKE BY THE SAN FELIPE AND IN ALL THIS TIME NOT A SINGLE SHOT HAD THE SPANIARDS CONTRIVED TO FIRE SO COMPLETELY HAD THEY BEEN TAKEN BY SURPRISE
THE ADMIRAL GOT HIS CREW ASHORE ON PALOMAS AS BEST HE COULD AND THEN JUST AS CAPTAIN BLOOD ACCOUNTED THE VICTORY WON AND THAT HIS WAY OUT OF THAT TRAP TO THE OPEN SEA BEYOND LAY CLEAR THE FORT SUDDENLY REVEALED ITS FORMIDABLE
HAVING ITS NECK TOWARDS THE SEA AT MARACAYBO BEYOND THIS NECK IT WIDENS AGAIN AND THEN THE TWO LONG NARROW STRIPS OF LAND KNOWN AS THE ISLANDS OF VIGILIAS AND PALOMAS BLOCK THE CHANNEL STANDING LENGTHWISE ACROSS IT
WITH A CALM CONFIDENCE BASED UPON ITS OVERWHELMING STRENGTH WAS COMMANDED BY HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMY
PIECES OF EIGHT WHICH HE HAD PROVIDED FOR MADEMOISELLE'S RANSOM AND SHREWD HARD BARGAIN DRIVER THOUGH HE MIGHT BE
THE STERN CHASERS OF THE SALVADOR DESULTORILY
AND I SEE I SEE AN ABANDONED FORT AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE LAKE AND NOBODY THERE TO FIRE A GUN AT US WHEN WE CAME IN THEN I SUSPECT THE TRAP WHO WOULD NOT THAT HAD EYES AND BRAIN BAH WE COME ON
CAME AN ANGRY RUMBLE OF APPROVAL THE SINGLE EYE OF THE GIGANTIC WOLVERSTONE ROLLED TERRIBLY AND HE CLENCHED HIS GREAT FISTS AS IF TO STRIKE THE FRENCHMAN WHO WAS EXPOSING THEM TO MUTINY BUT CAHUSAC WAS NOT DAUNTED
HAD NOT PITT HER MASTER HIMSELF SEIZED THE WHIPSTAFF AND PUT THE HELM HARD OVER TO SWING HER SHARPLY OFF TO STARBOARD SHE MUST HAVE SUFFERED STILL WORSE FROM THE SECOND VOLLEY THAT FOLLOWED FAST UPON THE FIRST
AT THE OPEN PORTS ON HER LARBOARD SIDE ON THE EVENING OF THE FOURTH DAY EVERYTHING BEING NOW IN READINESS ALL WERE GOT ABOARD AND THE EMPTY PLEASANT CITY OF MARACAYBO WAS AT LAST ABANDONED BUT THEY DID NOT WEIGH ANCHOR UNTIL SOME TWO HOURS AFTER MIDNIGHT
WE RETURN HERE WITH SOME TWO THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT BUT WHAT IS IT IN REALITY WILL YOU TELL ME OR SHALL I TELL YOU IT IS A PIECE OF CHEESE A PIECE OF CHEESE IN A MOUSETRAP AND WE ARE THE LITTLE MICE GODDAM AND THE CATS OH
HIS VICTORY WAS RENDERED BARREN BY THREE LUCKY SHOTS FROM AN UNSUSPECTED BATTERY BY WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND BARREN MUST THEIR VICTORY REMAIN UNTIL THEY COULD REDUCE THE FORT THAT STILL REMAINED TO DEFEND THE PASSAGE
AND UTTERLY UNSUSPECTED STRENGTH WITH A ROAR THE CANNONS ROYAL PROCLAIMED THEMSELVES AND THE ARABELLA STAGGERED UNDER A BLOW THAT SMASHED HER BULWARKS AT THE WAIST AND SCATTERED DEATH AND CONFUSION AMONG THE SEAMEN GATHERED THERE
AND TWO SLOOPS CAPTURED AT GIBRALTAR WHICH THEY HAD INDIFFERENTLY ARMED WITH FOUR CULVERINS EACH
TRUE WE MAKE HIM PAY BIG RANSOM FOR GIBRALTAR
AND IS IT LIKE THAT SAID CAPTAIN BLOOD WITH A QUIET SMILE THOUGH THE HEART OF HIM SANK AT THIS FAILURE OF HIS BLUSTER
SO THAT THEY MIGHT LISTEN TO WHAT PASSED AMONG THEIR LEADERS CAHUSAC APPEARED TO BE HAVING IT ALL HIS OWN WAY AND HE RAISED HIS HARSH QUERULOUS VOICE SO THAT ALL MIGHT HEAR HIS TRUCULENT DENUNCIATION HE SPOKE
AND THEN ONE OF THEIR OFFICERS RENDERED RECKLESS BY PANIC
AND IT DOESN'T HELP US TO SOLVE THE RIDDLE THAT'S BEFORE US
AND SO IN THE END DESPITE ALL THAT CAHUSAC COULD SAY THE SURRENDER WAS NOT TO DON MIGUEL BUT TO PETER BLOOD THEY HAD COME INTO THE VENTURE WITH HIM THEY ASSERTED AND THEY WOULD GO OUT OF IT WITH HIM OR NOT AT ALL
IF HE WILL ACCORD US PASSAGE WITH THE HONOURS OF WAR THIS MORNING I RECEIVE HIS ANSWER HE ACCORD US THIS ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE CARRY NOTHING AWAY WITH US
HAD NOT HALF THE PERIL WITH WHICH IT WAS FRAUGHT FOR HIMSELF HE TURNED FROM CAHUSAC TO ADDRESS THE MOB OF BUCCANEERS WHO HAD SURGED NEARER TO HEAR HIM FOR HE HAD NOT TROUBLED TO RAISE HIS VOICE
AND I INTEND TO SETTLE IT TAKE YOU THAT MESSAGE BACK SO BACK TO MARACAYBO BACK TO HIS OWN HANDSOME HOUSE IN WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD HAD ESTABLISHED HIS QUARTERS
ALONG WITH MISTRESS I'LL SHOW YOU UP STAIRS IF YOU PLEASE THANK'EE HE KNOWS ME SAID SCROOGE WITH HIS HAND ALREADY ON THE DINING ROOM LOCK I'LL GO IN HERE MY DEAR HE TURNED IT GENTLY
AND I WILL LIGHT A FIRE THAT YOU MAY NOT BE COLD HANSEL AND GRETEL GATHERED BRUSHWOOD TOGETHER AS HIGH AS A LITTLE HILL THE BRUSHWOOD WAS LIGHTED AND WHEN THE FLAMES WERE BURNING VERY HIGH THE WOMAN SAID
BUT THEY HAVE A KEEN SCENT LIKE THE BEASTS AND ARE AWARE WHEN HUMAN BEINGS DRAW NEAR WHEN HANSEL AND GRETEL CAME INTO HER NEIGHBOURHOOD SHE LAUGHED WITH MALICE AND SAID MOCKINGLY
GET UP LAZY THING FETCH SOME WATER AND COOK SOMETHING GOOD FOR YOUR BROTHER HE IS IN THE STABLE OUTSIDE AND IS TO BE MADE FAT WHEN HE IS FAT I WILL EAT HIM
OPENED HIS LITTLE STABLE AND CRIED HANSEL WE ARE SAVED THE OLD WITCH IS DEAD THEN HANSEL SPRANG LIKE A BIRD FROM ITS CAGE WHEN THE DOOR IS OPENED HOW THEY DID REJOICE AND EMBRACE EACH OTHER
UNTIL THE MOON HAS RISEN AND THEN WE WILL SOON FIND THE WAY AND WHEN THE FULL MOON HAD RISEN HANSEL TOOK HIS LITTLE SISTER BY THE HAND AND FOLLOWED THE PEBBLES WHICH SHONE LIKE NEWLY COINED SILVER PIECES
LITTLE DUCK LITTLE DUCK DOST THOU SEE HANSEL AND GRETEL ARE WAITING FOR THEE THERE'S NEVER A PLANK OR BRIDGE IN SIGHT TAKE US ACROSS ON THY BACK SO WHITE
APPLES AND NUTS AFTERWARDS TWO PRETTY LITTLE BEDS WERE COVERED WITH CLEAN WHITE LINEN AND HANSEL AND GRETEL LAY DOWN IN THEM AND THOUGHT THEY WERE IN HEAVEN THE OLD WOMAN
THE CHILDREN HOWEVER WERE STILL AWAKE AND HAD HEARD THE CONVERSATION WHEN THE OLD FOLKS WERE ASLEEP HANSEL AGAIN GOT UP AND WANTED TO GO OUT AND PICK UP PEBBLES AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE
THEY SET OUT BUT THEY FOUND NO CRUMBS FOR THE MANY THOUSANDS OF BIRDS WHICH FLY ABOUT IN THE WOODS AND FIELDS HAD PICKED THEM ALL UP HANSEL SAID TO GRETEL WE SHALL SOON FIND THE WAY BUT THEY DID NOT FIND IT
AS GOOD A FRIEND AS GOOD A MASTER AND AS GOOD A MAN AS THE GOOD OLD CITY KNEW
STARTING OFF AGAIN AND GOING ROUND THE FIREPLACE THERE'S THE DOOR BY WHICH THE GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY ENTERED THERE'S THE CORNER WHERE THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT SAT
TOWN OR BOROUGH IN THE GOOD OLD WORLD SOME PEOPLE LAUGHED TO SEE THE ALTERATION IN HIM BUT HE LET THEM LAUGH AND LITTLE HEEDED THEM FOR HE WAS WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW
AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE KITCHENS OF HOUSES AND UP TO THE WINDOWS AND FOUND THAT EVERYTHING COULD YIELD HIM PLEASURE HE HAD NEVER DREAMED THAT ANY WALK THAT ANYTHING COULD GIVE HIM SO MUCH HAPPINESS IN THE AFTERNOON
GLORIOUS RUNNING TO THE WINDOW HE OPENED IT AND PUT OUT HIS HEAD NO FOG NO MIST CLEAR BRIGHT JOVIAL
GRETEL BEGAN TO WEEP BITTERLY BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN FOR SHE WAS FORCED TO DO WHAT THE WICKED WITCH COMMANDED AND NOW THE BEST FOOD WAS COOKED FOR POOR HANSEL BUT GRETEL
BUT NOW WE MUST BE OFF SAID HANSEL THAT WE MAY GET OUT OF THE WITCH'S FOREST WHEN THEY HAD WALKED FOR TWO HOURS THEY CAME TO A GREAT STRETCH OF WATER WE CANNOT CROSS SAID HANSEL
LORD BLESS ME CRIED THE GENTLEMAN AS IF HIS BREATH WERE TAKEN AWAY MY DEAR MISTER SCROOGE ARE YOU SERIOUS IF YOU PLEASE SAID SCROOGE NOT A FARTHING LESS
IT'S A PLEASURE TO TALK TO HIM YES MY BUCK IT'S HANGING THERE NOW REPLIED THE BOY IS IT SAID SCROOGE GO AND BUY IT WALK ER EXCLAIMED THE BOY

AND SHOWED THEM THE WAY THEY WALKED THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG AND BY BREAK OF DAY CAME ONCE MORE TO THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE THEY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND WHEN THE WOMAN OPENED IT AND SAW THAT IT WAS HANSEL AND GRETEL SHE SAID
WONDERFUL PARTY WONDERFUL GAMES WONDERFUL UNANIMITY WON DER FUL HAPPINESS BUT HE WAS EARLY AT THE OFFICE NEXT MORNING
WITH THEIR PLUMP AND ROSY CHEEKS SHE MUTTERED TO HERSELF THAT WILL BE A DAINTY MOUTHFUL THEN SHE SEIZED HANSEL WITH HER SHRIVELLED HAND CARRIED HIM INTO A LITTLE STABLE
DO NOT DISTRESS YOURSELF I WILL SOON FIND A WAY TO HELP US AND WHEN THE OLD FOLKS HAD FALLEN ASLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS LITTLE COAT OPENED THE DOOR BELOW AND CREPT OUTSIDE
AS HE HAD SEEN THEM WITH THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND WALKING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM SCROOGE REGARDED EVERY ONE WITH A DELIGHTED SMILE HE LOOKED SO IRRESISTIBLY PLEASANT IN A WORD
SCROOGE SAT WITH HIS DOOR WIDE OPEN THAT HE MIGHT SEE HIM COME INTO THE TANK HIS HAT WAS OFF BEFORE HE OPENED THE DOOR HIS COMFORTER TOO HE WAS ON HIS STOOL IN A JIFFY
NOW CHILDREN LAY YOURSELVES DOWN BY THE FIRE AND REST WE WILL GO INTO THE FOREST AND CUT SOME WOOD WHEN WE HAVE DONE WE WILL COME BACK AND FETCH YOU AWAY HANSEL AND GRETEL
WHO HAD DIM EYES COULD NOT SEE IT AND THOUGHT IT WAS HANSEL'S FINGER AND WAS ASTONISHED THAT THERE WAS NO WAY OF FATTENING HIM WHEN FOUR WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND HANSEL STILL REMAINED THIN
A GREAT MANY BACK PAYMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN IT I ASSURE YOU WILL YOU DO ME THAT FAVOUR MY DEAR SIR SAID THE OTHER SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO SUCH MUNIFI
HE HAD A MOMENTARY IDEA OF KNOCKING SCROOGE DOWN WITH IT HOLDING HIM AND CALLING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE COURT FOR HELP AND A STRAIT WAISTCOAT A MERRY CHRISTMAS BOB SAID SCROOGE
TURKEY HE NEVER COULD HAVE STOOD UPON HIS LEGS THAT BIRD HE WOULD HAVE SNAPPED EM SHORT OFF IN A MINUTE LIKE STICKS OF SEALING WAX WHY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY THAT TO CAMDEN TOWN SAID SCROOGE
GOT NOTHING BUT CRAB SHELLS EVERY MORNING THE WOMAN CREPT TO THE LITTLE STABLE AND CRIED HANSEL STRETCH OUT YOUR FINGER THAT I MAY FEEL IF YOU WILL SOON BE FAT HANSEL HOWEVER
IF HE COULD ONLY BE THERE FIRST AND CATCH BOB CRATCHIT COMING LATE
HAD ONLY PRETENDED TO BE SO KIND SHE WAS IN REALITY A WICKED WITCH WHO LAY IN WAIT FOR CHILDREN AND HAD ONLY BUILT THE LITTLE HOUSE OF BREAD IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM THERE
THE DUCK CAME TO THEM AND HANSEL SEATED HIMSELF ON ITS BACK AND TOLD HIS SISTER TO SIT BY HIM NO REPLIED GRETEL THAT WILL BE TOO HEAVY FOR THE LITTLE DUCK
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COMING HERE AT THIS TIME OF DAY I AM VERY SORRY SIR SAID BOB I AM BEHIND MY TIME YOU ARE REPEATED SCROOGE YES I THINK YOU ARE
TO WHERE IT IS THE THICKEST THERE WE WILL LIGHT A FIRE FOR THEM AND GIVE EACH OF THEM ONE MORE PIECE OF BREAD AND THEN WE WILL GO TO OUR WORK AND LEAVE THEM ALONE THEY WILL NOT FIND THE WAY HOME AGAIN
SCROOGE WAS BETTER THAN HIS WORD HE DID IT ALL AND INFINITELY MORE AND TO TINY TIM WHO DID NOT DIE HE WAS A SECOND FATHER HE BECAME
STIRRING COLD COLD PIPING FOR THE BLOOD TO DANCE TO GOLDEN SUNLIGHT HEAVENLY SKY SWEET FRESH AIR MERRY BELLS
EARLY IN THE MORNING GRETEL HAD TO GO OUT AND HANG UP THE CAULDRON WITH THE WATER AND LIGHT THE FIRE WE WILL BAKE FIRST SAID THE OLD WOMAN I HAVE ALREADY HEATED THE OVEN
THAT NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ON THIS GLOBE FOR GOOD AT WHICH SOME PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE THEIR FILL OF LAUGHTER IN THE OUTSET AND KNOWING THAT SUCH AS THESE WOULD BE BLIND ANYWAY
AND KNEADED THE DOUGH SHE PUSHED POOR GRETEL OUT TO THE OVEN FROM WHICH FLAMES OF FIRE WERE ALREADY DARTING CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS PROPERLY HEATED
WHEN A CHILD FELL INTO HER POWER SHE KILLED IT COOKED AND ATE IT AND THAT WAS A FEAST DAY WITH HER WITCHES HAVE RED EYES AND CANNOT SEE FAR
THEY WALKED THE WHOLE NIGHT AND ALL THE NEXT DAY TOO FROM MORNING TILL EVENING BUT THEY DID NOT GET OUT OF THE FOREST AND WERE VERY HUNGRY FOR THEY HAD NOTHING TO EAT BUT TWO OR THREE BERRIES WHICH GREW ON THE GROUND
SO THAT WE CAN PUT THE BREAD IN AND ONCE GRETEL WAS INSIDE SHE INTENDED TO SHUT THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE IN IT AND THEN SHE WOULD EAT HER TOO BUT GRETEL SAW WHAT SHE HAD IN MIND AND SAID
NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY FRIEND SAID SCROOGE I AM NOT GOING TO STAND THIS SORT OF THING ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE HE CONTINUED LEAPING FROM HIS STOOL
NO HARM SHALL HAPPEN TO YOU SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER LITTLE HOUSE THEN GOOD FOOD WAS SET BEFORE THEM MILK AND PANCAKES WITH SUGAR
HE WAS AT HOME IN FIVE MINUTES NOTHING COULD BE HEARTIER HIS NIECE LOOKED JUST THE SAME SO DID TOPPER WHEN HE CAME SO DID THE PLUMP SISTER WHEN SHE CAME SO DID EVERY ONE WHEN THEY CAME
WHEN AT LAST THEY AWOKE IT WAS ALREADY DARK NIGHT GRETEL BEGAN TO CRY AND SAID HOW ARE WE TO GET OUT OF THE FOREST NOW BUT HANSEL COMFORTED HER AND SAID JUST WAIT A LITTLE
NOT LONG AFTERWARDS THERE WAS ONCE MORE GREAT DEARTH THROUGHOUT THE LAND AND THE CHILDREN HEARD THEIR MOTHER SAYING AT NIGHT TO THEIR FATHER
THEY SAW A BEAUTIFUL SNOW WHITE BIRD SITTING ON A BOUGH WHICH SANG SO DELIGHTFULLY THAT THEY STOOD STILL AND LISTENED TO IT AND WHEN ITS SONG WAS OVER IT SPREAD ITS WINGS AND FLEW AWAY BEFORE THEM
IF THE WILD BEASTS IN THE FOREST HAD BUT DEVOURED US WE SHOULD AT ANY RATE HAVE DIED TOGETHER JUST KEEP YOUR NOISE TO YOURSELF SAID THE OLD WOMAN IT WON'T HELP YOU AT ALL
HALLO HERE HE WAS CHECKED IN HIS TRANSPORTS BY THE CHURCHES RINGING OUT THE LUSTIEST PEALS HE HAD EVER HEARD
AND GIVING BOB SUCH A DIG IN THE WAISTCOAT THAT HE STAGGERED BACK INTO THE TANK AGAIN AND THEREFORE I AM ABOUT TO RAISE YOUR SALARY BOB TREMBLED AND GOT A LITTLE NEARER TO THE RULER
AND BROKE OFF A LITTLE OF THE ROOF TO TRY HOW IT TASTED AND GRETEL LEANT AGAINST THE WINDOW AND NIBBLED AT THE PANES THEN A SOFT VOICE CRIED FROM THE PARLOUR NIBBLE NIBBLE GNAW
OH THEN SHE BEGAN TO HOWL QUITE HORRIBLY BUT GRETEL RAN AWAY AND THE GODLESS WITCH WAS MISERABLY BURNT TO DEATH GRETEL HOWEVER RAN LIKE LIGHTNING TO HANSEL
OF COURSE THEY CAN OF COURSE THEY CAN HALLO MY FINE FELLOW
THEY SHALL NOT ESCAPE ME AGAIN EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE THE CHILDREN WERE AWAKE SHE WAS ALREADY UP AND WHEN SHE SAW BOTH OF THEM SLEEPING AND LOOKING SO PRETTY
AND AS THEY WERE SO WEARY THAT THEIR LEGS WOULD CARRY THEM NO LONGER THEY LAY DOWN BENEATH A TREE AND FELL ASLEEP IT WAS NOW THREE MORNINGS SINCE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE
AND WANTS TO SAY GOODBYE TO ME ANSWERED HANSEL FOOL SAID THE WOMAN THAT IS NOT YOUR LITTLE PIGEON THAT IS THE MORNING SUN THAT IS SHINING ON THE CHIMNEY HANSEL HOWEVER LITTLE BY LITTLE THREW ALL THE CRUMBS
BUT A BRANCH WHICH HE HAD FASTENED TO A WITHERED TREE WHICH THE WIND WAS BLOWING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AND AS THEY HAD BEEN SITTING SUCH A LONG TIME THEIR EYES CLOSED WITH FATIGUE AND THEY FELL FAST ASLEEP
TO MAKE AMENDS IN I WILL LIVE IN THE PAST THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE SCROOGE REPEATED AS HE SCRAMBLED OUT OF BED THE SPIRITS OF ALL THREE SHALL STRIVE WITHIN ME
THE WOMAN HOWEVER WAS DEAD GRETEL EMPTIED HER PINAFORE UNTIL PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES RAN ABOUT THE ROOM AND HANSEL THREW ONE HANDFUL AFTER ANOTHER OUT OF HIS POCKET TO ADD TO THEM
I DON'T KNOW WHAT DAY OF THE MONTH IT IS SAID SCROOGE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN AMONG THE SPIRITS I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING I'M QUITE A BABY NEVER MIND I DON'T CARE
I AM AS MERRY AS A SCHOOLBOY I AM AS GIDDY AS A DRUNKEN MAN A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO EVERYBODY A HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL THE WORLD HALLO HERE WHOOP
AND DANCE ABOUT AND KISS EACH OTHER AND AS THEY HAD NO LONGER ANY NEED TO FEAR HER THEY WENT INTO THE WITCH'S HOUSE AND IN EVERY CORNER THERE STOOD CHESTS FULL OF PEARLS AND JEWELS
WHO IS NIBBLING AT MY LITTLE HOUSE THE CHILDREN ANSWERED THE WIND THE WIND THE HEAVEN BORN WIND AND WENT ON EATING WITHOUT DISTURBING THEMSELVES
I SAY IT ON MY KNEES OLD JACOB ON MY KNEES HE WAS SO FLUTTERED AND SO GLOWING WITH HIS GOOD INTENTIONS THAT HIS BROKEN VOICE WOULD SCARCELY ANSWER TO HIS CALL
YOU NAUGHTY CHILDREN WHY HAVE YOU SLEPT SO LONG IN THE FOREST WE THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING BACK AT ALL THE FATHER HOWEVER REJOICED FOR IT HAD CUT HIM TO THE HEART TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND ALONE
THEN HE WENT BACK AND SAID TO GRETEL BE COMFORTED DEAR LITTLE SISTER AND SLEEP IN PEACE GOD WILL NOT FORSAKE US AND HE LAY DOWN AGAIN IN HIS BED WHEN DAY DAWNED
JUST SIT THERE YOU CHILDREN AND WHEN YOU ARE TIRED YOU MAY SLEEP A LITTLE WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO CUT WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE DONE WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AWAY WHEN IT WAS NOON
I THANK YOU FIFTY TIMES BLESS YOU HE WENT TO CHURCH AND WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS AND WATCHED THE PEOPLE HURRYING TO AND FRO AND PATTED CHILDREN ON THE HEAD AND QUESTIONED BEGGARS
AND BEEN QUITE SATISFIED HE DRESSED HIMSELF ALL IN HIS BEST AND AT LAST GOT OUT INTO THE STREETS THE PEOPLE WERE BY THIS TIME POURING FORTH
AND SIDLED HIS FACE IN ROUND THE DOOR THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE TABLE WHICH WAS SPREAD OUT IN GREAT ARRAY FOR THESE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS ARE ALWAYS NERVOUS ON SUCH POINTS AND LIKE TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS RIGHT FRED
REALLY FOR A MAN WHO HAD BEEN OUT OF PRACTICE FOR SO MANY YEARS IT WAS A SPLENDID LAUGH A MOST ILLUSTRIOUS LAUGH THE FATHER OF A LONG LONG LINE OF BRILLIANT LAUGHS
SUDDENLY THE DOOR OPENED AND A WOMAN AS OLD AS THE HILLS WHO SUPPORTED HERSELF ON CRUTCHES CAME CREEPING OUT HANSEL AND GRETEL WERE SO TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
THERE'S THE WINDOW WHERE I SAW THE WANDERING SPIRITS IT'S ALL RIGHT
THE HAND IN WHICH HE WROTE THE ADDRESS WAS NOT A STEADY ONE BUT WRITE IT HE DID SOMEHOW AND WENT DOWN STAIRS TO OPEN THE STREET DOOR READY FOR THE COMING OF THE POULTERER'S MAN
THE WOMAN LED THE CHILDREN STILL DEEPER INTO THE FOREST WHERE THEY HAD NEVER IN THEIR LIVES BEEN BEFORE THEN A GREAT FIRE WAS AGAIN MADE AND THE MOTHER SAID
BUT SCOLDED AND REPROACHED HIM HE WHO SAYS A MUST SAY B LIKEWISE AND AS HE HAD YIELDED THE FIRST TIME HE HAD TO DO SO A SECOND TIME ALSO
THAT THEY LET FALL WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR HANDS THE OLD WOMAN HOWEVER NODDED HER HEAD AND SAID OH YOU DEAR CHILDREN WHO HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE DO COME IN AND STAY WITH ME
AND HAD HEARD WHAT THEIR STEPMOTHER HAD SAID TO THEIR FATHER GRETEL WEPT BITTER TEARS AND SAID TO HANSEL NOW ALL IS OVER WITH US BE QUIET GRETEL SAID HANSEL
HE THOUGHT IT QUITE AS WELL THAT THEY SHOULD WRINKLE UP THEIR EYES IN GRINS AS HAVE THE MALADY IN LESS ATTRACTIVE FORMS HIS OWN HEART LAUGHED AND THAT WAS QUITE ENOUGH FOR HIM
IT SENT A PANG ACROSS HIS HEART TO THINK HOW THIS OLD GENTLEMAN WOULD LOOK UPON HIM WHEN THEY MET BUT HE KNEW WHAT PATH LAY STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM AND HE TOOK IT
YOU MUST HAVE A CAB THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE SAID THIS AND THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE PAID FOR THE TURKEY AND THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE PAID FOR THE CAB AND THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE RECOMPENSED THE BOY
STEP THIS WAY SIR IF YOU PLEASE IT'S ONLY ONCE A YEAR SIR PLEADED BOB APPEARING FROM THE TANK IT SHALL NOT BE REPEATED I WAS MAKING RATHER MERRY YESTERDAY SIR
YES AND THE BEDPOST WAS HIS OWN THE BED WAS HIS OWN THE ROOM WAS HIS OWN BEST AND HAPPIEST OF ALL THE TIME BEFORE HIM WAS HIS OWN
SAT BY THE FIRE AND WHEN NOON CAME EACH ATE A LITTLE PIECE OF BREAD AND AS THEY HEARD THE STROKES OF THE WOOD AXE THEY BELIEVED THAT THEIR FATHER WAS NEAR IT WAS NOT THE AXE HOWEVER
AND LOCKED HIM IN BEHIND A GRATED DOOR SCREAM AS HE MIGHT IT WOULD NOT HELP HIM THEN SHE WENT TO GRETEL SHOOK HER TILL SHE AWOKE AND CRIED
AND WE SHALL BE RID OF THEM NO WIFE SAID THE MAN I WILL NOT DO THAT HOW CAN I BEAR TO LEAVE MY CHILDREN ALONE IN THE FOREST THE WILD ANIMALS WOULD SOON COME
DRIVING AWAY WITH HIS PEN AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO OVERTAKE NINE O'CLOCK HALLO GROWLED SCROOGE IN HIS ACCUSTOMED VOICE AS NEAR AS HE COULD FEIGN IT
AND TEAR THEM TO PIECES O YOU FOOL SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU MAY AS WELL PLANE THE PLANKS FOR OUR COFFINS AND SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE
AND HE DID IT YES HE DID THE CLOCK STRUCK NINE NO BOB A QUARTER PAST NO BOB
SHE SHALL TAKE US ACROSS ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE GOOD LITTLE DUCK DID SO AND WHEN THEY WERE ONCE SAFELY ACROSS AND HAD WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME THE FOREST SEEMED TO BE MORE AND MORE FAMILIAR TO THEM AND AT LENGTH
HE TURNED HIS STEPS TOWARDS HIS NEPHEW'S HOUSE HE PASSED THE DOOR A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE HE HAD THE COURAGE TO GO UP AND KNOCK BUT HE MADE A DASH AND DID IT
I KNOW THEY WILL HIS HANDS WERE BUSY WITH HIS GARMENTS ALL THIS TIME TURNING THEM INSIDE OUT PUTTING THEM ON UPSIDE DOWN TEARING THEM MISLAYING THEM
AS HE STOOD THERE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL THE KNOCKER CAUGHT HIS EYE I SHALL LOVE IT AS LONG AS I LIVE CRIED SCROOGE PATTING IT WITH HIS HAND I SCARCELY EVER LOOKED AT IT BEFORE
HALLO HE HAD FRISKED INTO THE SITTING ROOM AND WAS NOW STANDING THERE PERFECTLY WINDED THERE'S THE SAUCEPAN THAT THE GRUEL WAS IN CRIED SCROOGE
HOW ARE WE TO FEED OUR POOR CHILDREN WHEN WE NO LONGER HAVE ANYTHING EVEN FOR OURSELVES I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HUSBAND ANSWERED THE WOMAN EARLY TOMORROW MORNING WE WILL TAKE THE CHILDREN OUT INTO THE FOREST

DON'T SAY ANYTHING PLEASE RETORTED SCROOGE COME AND SEE ME WILL YOU COME AND SEE ME I WILL CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND IT WAS CLEAR HE MEANT TO DO IT THANK'EE SAID SCROOGE I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
THEY SAW FROM AFAR THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN RUSHED INTO THE PARLOUR AND THREW THEMSELVES ROUND THEIR FATHER'S NECK THE MAN HAD NOT KNOWN ONE HAPPY HOUR SINCE HE HAD LEFT THE CHILDREN IN THE FOREST
WERE ONLY TO BE EXCEEDED BY THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE SAT DOWN BREATHLESS IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN AND CHUCKLED TILL HE CRIED SHAVING WAS NOT AN EASY TASK
INDICATING THE DANGERS OF THE REGION TOWARDS WHICH WE ARE ADVANCING APPEAR TO DISMAY THEM WE HAVE ALREADY REACHED A VERY HIGH LATITUDE BUT IT IS THE HEIGHT OF SUMMER AND ALTHOUGH NOT SO WARM AS IN ENGLAND
YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT A HISTORY OF ALL THE VOYAGES MADE FOR PURPOSES OF DISCOVERY COMPOSED THE WHOLE
BUT TO RETURN TO DEARER CONSIDERATIONS SHALL I MEET YOU AGAIN AFTER HAVING TRAVERSED IMMENSE SEAS
BE ASSURED THAT FOR MY OWN SAKE AS WELL AS YOURS I WILL NOT RASHLY ENCOUNTER DANGER I WILL BE COOL PERSEVERING AND PRUDENT BUT SUCCESS SHALL CROWN MY ENDEAVOURS WHEREFORE NOT
ARE SOUL SUBDUING MUSIC AUGUST NINETEENTH
I HAVE PROMISED THAT SOMEONE SHOULD WATCH FOR HIM AND GIVE HIM INSTANT NOTICE IF ANY NEW OBJECT SHOULD APPEAR IN SIGHT SUCH IS MY JOURNAL OF WHAT RELATES TO THIS STRANGE OCCURRENCE UP TO THE PRESENT DAY
HOW GLADLY I WOULD SACRIFICE MY FORTUNE MY EXISTENCE MY EVERY HOPE TO THE FURTHERANCE OF MY ENTERPRISE ONE MAN'S LIFE OR DEATH WERE BUT A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR THE ACQUIREMENT OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH I SOUGHT FOR THE DOMINION
AND AM OCCUPIED IN COLLECTING MY SAILORS THOSE WHOM I HAVE ALREADY ENGAGED APPEAR TO BE MEN ON WHOM I CAN DEPEND AND ARE CERTAINLY POSSESSED OF DAUNTLESS COURAGE BUT I HAVE ONE WANT WHICH I HAVE NEVER YET BEEN ABLE TO SATISFY
I FELT MYSELF PECULIARLY FORTUNATE IN BEING ABLE TO SECURE HIS SERVICES I HEARD OF HIM FIRST IN RATHER A ROMANTIC MANNER FROM A LADY WHO OWES TO HIM THE HAPPINESS OF HER LIFE THIS BRIEFLY IS HIS STORY
WITHIN WHOSE CIRCLE NO GRIEF OR FOLLY VENTURES WILL YOU SMILE AT THE ENTHUSIASM I EXPRESS CONCERNING THIS DIVINE WANDERER YOU WOULD NOT IF YOU SAW HIM
AND THE WORLD BEFORE YOU AND HAVE NO CAUSE FOR DESPAIR BUT I I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING AND CANNOT BEGIN LIFE ANEW AS HE SAID THIS HIS COUNTENANCE BECAME EXPRESSIVE OF A CALM
IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY COURAGE AND MY RESOLUTION IS FIRM BUT MY HOPES FLUCTUATE AND MY SPIRITS ARE OFTEN DEPRESSED I AM ABOUT TO PROCEED ON A LONG AND DIFFICULT VOYAGE THE EMERGENCIES OF WHICH WILL DEMAND ALL MY FORTITUDE
WHENEVER THE SAFETY OF OTHERS IS COMMITTED TO MY CARE I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU MY SENSATIONS ON THE NEAR PROSPECT OF MY UNDERTAKING
SHUT IN HOWEVER BY ICE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW HIS TRACK WHICH WE HAD OBSERVED WITH THE GREATEST ATTENTION ABOUT TWO HOURS AFTER THIS OCCURRENCE WE HEARD THE GROUND SEA AND BEFORE NIGHT THE ICE BROKE AND FREED OUR SHIP
FINDING THAT HE WAS UNEMPLOYED IN THIS CITY I EASILY ENGAGED HIM TO ASSIST IN MY ENTERPRISE THE MASTER IS A PERSON OF AN EXCELLENT DISPOSITION AND IS REMARKABLE IN THE SHIP
THE BREAKING UP OF THE ICE HAD DESTROYED THE OTHER SLEDGE I REPLIED THAT I COULD NOT ANSWER WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY FOR THE ICE HAD NOT BROKEN UNTIL NEAR MIDNIGHT AND THE TRAVELLER MIGHT HAVE ARRIVED AT A PLACE OF SAFETY BEFORE THAT TIME
HIS EYES HAVE GENERALLY AN EXPRESSION OF WILDNESS AND EVEN MADNESS BUT THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN IF ANYONE PERFORMS AN ACT OF KINDNESS TOWARDS HIM OR DOES HIM ANY THE MOST TRIFLING SERVICE
HE APPEARED TO DESPISE HIMSELF FOR BEING THE SLAVE OF PASSION AND QUELLING THE DARK TYRANNY OF DESPAIR HE LED ME AGAIN TO CONVERSE CONCERNING MYSELF PERSONALLY HE ASKED ME THE HISTORY OF MY EARLIER YEARS THE TALE WAS QUICKLY TOLD
MY DEAR SISTER I WRITE A FEW LINES IN HASTE TO SAY THAT I AM SAFE AND WELL ADVANCED ON MY VOYAGE THIS LETTER WILL REACH ENGLAND BY A MERCHANTMAN NOW ON ITS HOMEWARD VOYAGE FROM ARCHANGEL MORE FORTUNATE THAN I
FAREWELL MY DEAR EXCELLENT MARGARET HEAVEN SHOWER DOWN BLESSINGS ON YOU AND SAVE ME THAT I MAY AGAIN AND AGAIN TESTIFY MY GRATITUDE FOR ALL YOUR LOVE AND KINDNESS YOUR AFFECTIONATE BROTHER
AH DEAR SISTER HOW CAN I ANSWER THIS QUESTION IF I SUCCEED MANY MANY MONTHS PERHAPS YEARS WILL PASS BEFORE YOU AND I MAY MEET IF I FAIL YOU WILL SEE ME AGAIN SOON OR NEVER
WHEN MY GUEST WAS A LITTLE RECOVERED I HAD GREAT TROUBLE TO KEEP OFF THE MEN WHO WISHED TO ASK HIM A THOUSAND QUESTIONS BUT I WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO BE TORMENTED BY THEIR IDLE CURIOSITY IN A STATE OF BODY AND MIND WHOSE RESTORATION EVIDENTLY DEPENDED UPON ENTIRE REPOSE
YESTERDAY THE STRANGER SAID TO ME YOU MAY EASILY PERCEIVE CAPTAIN WALTON THAT I HAVE SUFFERED GREAT AND UNPARALLELED MISFORTUNES
OUR SITUATION WAS SOMEWHAT DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY AS WE WERE COMPASSED ROUND BY A VERY THICK FOG WE ACCORDINGLY LAY TO HOPING THAT SOME CHANGE WOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND WEATHER
OF THE MOST IMAGINATIVE OF MODERN POETS THERE IS SOMETHING AT WORK IN MY SOUL WHICH I DO NOT UNDERSTAND I AM PRACTICALLY INDUSTRIOUS PAINSTAKING A WORKMAN TO EXECUTE WITH PERSEVERANCE AND LABOUR
WHICH I MAY NEVER KNOW THAT I AM WAVERING IN MY RESOLUTIONS THOSE ARE AS FIXED AS FATE AND MY VOYAGE IS ONLY NOW DELAYED UNTIL THE WEATHER SHALL PERMIT MY EMBARKATION THE WINTER HAS BEEN DREADFULLY SEVERE
THIS PROMISE DREW FROM ME THE WARMEST THANKS I HAVE RESOLVED EVERY NIGHT WHEN I AM NOT IMPERATIVELY OCCUPIED BY MY DUTIES TO RECORD AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE IN HIS OWN WORDS WHAT HE HAS RELATED DURING THE DAY
I VOLUNTARILY ENDURED COLD FAMINE THIRST AND WANT OF SLEEP I OFTEN WORKED HARDER THAN THE COMMON SAILORS DURING THE DAY AND DEVOTED MY NIGHTS TO THE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS THE THEORY OF MEDICINE
A QUICK BUT NEVER FAILING POWER OF JUDGMENT A PENETRATION INTO THE CAUSES OF THINGS UNEQUALLED FOR CLEARNESS AND PRECISION ADD TO THIS A FACILITY OF EXPRESSION AND A VOICE WHOSE VARIED INTONATIONS
WERE WE AMONG THE TAMER SCENES OF NATURE I MIGHT FEAR TO ENCOUNTER YOUR UNBELIEF PERHAPS YOUR RIDICULE BUT MANY THINGS WILL APPEAR POSSIBLE IN THESE WILD AND MYSTERIOUS REGIONS WHICH WOULD PROVOKE THE LAUGHTER OF THOSE UNACQUAINTED
ALTHOUGH WITH A FOREIGN ACCENT BEFORE I COME ON BOARD YOUR VESSEL SAID HE WILL YOU HAVE THE KINDNESS TO INFORM ME WHITHER YOU ARE BOUND YOU MAY CONCEIVE MY ASTONISHMENT ON HEARING SUCH A QUESTION ADDRESSED TO ME
AND PLACED HIM NEAR THE CHIMNEY OF THE KITCHEN STOVE BY SLOW DEGREES HE RECOVERED AND ATE A LITTLE SOUP WHICH RESTORED HIM WONDERFULLY TWO DAYS PASSED IN THIS MANNER BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK
WHAT CAN STOP THE DETERMINED HEART AND RESOLVED WILL OF MAN MY SWELLING HEART INVOLUNTARILY POURS ITSELF OUT THUS BUT I MUST FINISH HEAVEN BLESS MY BELOVED SISTER R W
SUCH A MAN HAS A DOUBLE EXISTENCE HE MAY SUFFER MISERY AND BE OVERWHELMED BY DISAPPOINTMENTS YET WHEN HE HAS RETIRED INTO HIMSELF HE WILL BE LIKE A CELESTIAL SPIRIT THAT HAS A HALO AROUND HIM
BUT YOU HAVE WON ME TO ALTER MY DETERMINATION YOU SEEK FOR KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AS I ONCE DID AND I ARDENTLY HOPE THAT THE GRATIFICATION OF YOUR WISHES MAY NOT BE A SERPENT TO STING YOU AS MINE HAS BEEN
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO HAVE POSSESSED AS THE BROTHER OF MY HEART I SHALL CONTINUE MY JOURNAL CONCERNING THE STRANGER AT INTERVALS SHOULD I HAVE ANY FRESH INCIDENTS TO RECORD AUGUST THIRTEENTH
BUT SHE WAS BATHED IN TEARS AND THROWING HERSELF AT HIS FEET ENTREATED HIM TO SPARE HER CONFESSING AT THE SAME TIME THAT SHE LOVED ANOTHER BUT THAT HE WAS POOR AND THAT HER FATHER WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO THE UNION
I HAVE NO AMBITION TO LOSE MY LIFE ON THE POST ROAD BETWEEN SAINT PETERSBURGH AND ARCHANGEL I SHALL DEPART FOR THE LATTER TOWN IN A FORTNIGHT OR THREE WEEKS AND MY INTENTION IS TO HIRE A SHIP THERE
I CAN EVEN NOW REMEMBER THE HOUR FROM WHICH I DEDICATED MYSELF TO THIS GREAT ENTERPRISE I COMMENCED BY INURING MY BODY TO HARDSHIP I ACCOMPANIED THE WHALE FISHERS ON SEVERAL EXPEDITIONS TO THE NORTH SEA
YOU MAY EASILY IMAGINE THAT I WAS MUCH GRATIFIED BY THE OFFERED COMMUNICATION YET I COULD NOT ENDURE THAT HE SHOULD RENEW HIS GRIEF BY A RECITAL OF HIS MISFORTUNES I FELT THE GREATEST EAGERNESS TO HEAR THE PROMISED NARRATIVE
UPON HEARING THIS HE APPEARED SATISFIED AND CONSENTED TO COME ON BOARD GOOD GOD MARGARET IF YOU HAD SEEN THE MAN WHO THUS CAPITULATED FOR HIS SAFETY YOUR SURPRISE WOULD HAVE BEEN BOUNDLESS HIS LIMBS WERE NEARLY FROZEN
I FEEL A COLD NORTHERN BREEZE PLAY UPON MY CHEEKS WHICH BRACES MY NERVES AND FILLS ME WITH DELIGHT DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS FEELING THIS BREEZE WHICH HAS TRAVELLED FROM THE REGIONS TOWARDS WHICH I AM ADVANCING GIVES ME A FORETASTE OF THOSE ICY CLIMES
STRANGE AN ACCIDENT HAS HAPPENED TO US THAT I CANNOT FORBEAR RECORDING IT ALTHOUGH IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT YOU WILL SEE ME BEFORE THESE PAPERS CAN COME INTO YOUR POSSESSION LAST MONDAY JULY THIRTY FIRST WE WERE NEARLY SURROUNDED BY ICE
THIS APPEARANCE EXCITED OUR UNQUALIFIED WONDER WE WERE AS WE BELIEVED MANY HUNDRED MILES FROM ANY LAND BUT THIS APPARITION SEEMED TO DENOTE THAT IT WAS NOT IN REALITY SO DISTANT AS WE HAD SUPPOSED
I AM TOO ARDENT IN EXECUTION AND TOO IMPATIENT OF DIFFICULTIES BUT IT IS A STILL GREATER EVIL TO ME THAT I AM SELF EDUCATED FOR THE FIRST FOURTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE I RAN WILD ON A COMMON
GENTLE YET COURAGEOUS POSSESSED OF A CULTIVATED AS WELL AS OF A CAPACIOUS MIND WHOSE TASTES ARE LIKE MY OWN TO APPROVE OR AMEND MY PLANS HOW WOULD SUCH A FRIEND REPAIR THE FAULTS OF YOUR POOR BROTHER
AND IS CONTINUALLY ON THE DECK APPARENTLY WATCHING FOR THE SLEDGE THAT PRECEDED HIS OWN YET ALTHOUGH UNHAPPY HE IS NOT SO UTTERLY OCCUPIED BY HIS OWN MISERY BUT THAT HE INTERESTS HIMSELF DEEPLY IN THE PROJECTS OF OTHERS
BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN MY FRIEND IF THUS YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO NAME YOU NOTHING CAN ALTER MY DESTINY LISTEN TO MY HISTORY AND YOU WILL PERCEIVE HOW IRREVOCABLY
BUT THE PAROXYSM OF GRIEF THAT HAD SEIZED THE STRANGER OVERCAME HIS WEAKENED POWERS AND MANY HOURS OF REPOSE AND TRANQUIL CONVERSATION WERE NECESSARY TO RESTORE HIS COMPOSURE HAVING CONQUERED THE VIOLENCE OF HIS FEELINGS
WITH WHAT INTEREST AND SYMPATHY SHALL I READ IT IN SOME FUTURE DAY EVEN NOW AS I COMMENCE MY TASK HIS FULL TONED VOICE SWELLS IN MY EARS HIS LUSTROUS EYES DWELL ON ME WITH ALL THEIR MELANCHOLY SWEETNESS
FROM A MAN ON THE BRINK OF DESTRUCTION AND TO WHOM I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED THAT MY VESSEL WOULD HAVE BEEN A RESOURCE WHICH HE WOULD NOT HAVE EXCHANGED FOR THE MOST PRECIOUS WEALTH THE EARTH CAN AFFORD I REPLIED HOWEVER THAT WE WERE ON A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY TOWARDS THE NORTHERN POLE
IF I SHOULD BE ENGAGED I WILL AT LEAST MAKE NOTES THIS MANUSCRIPT WILL DOUBTLESS AFFORD YOU THE GREATEST PLEASURE BUT TO ME WHO KNOW HIM AND WHO HEAR IT FROM HIS OWN LIPS
HAD FORBIDDEN MY UNCLE TO ALLOW ME TO EMBARK IN A SEAFARING LIFE THESE VISIONS FADED WHEN I PERUSED FOR THE FIRST TIME THOSE POETS WHOSE EFFUSIONS ENTRANCED MY SOUL AND LIFTED IT TO HEAVEN
BUT BESIDES THIS THERE IS A LOVE FOR THE MARVELLOUS A BELIEF IN THE MARVELLOUS INTERTWINED IN ALL MY PROJECTS WHICH HURRIES ME OUT OF THE COMMON PATHWAYS OF MEN
IF I AM ASSAILED BY DISAPPOINTMENT NO ONE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO SUSTAIN ME IN DEJECTION I SHALL COMMIT MY THOUGHTS TO PAPER IT IS TRUE BUT THAT IS A POOR MEDIUM FOR THE COMMUNICATION OF FEELING
BUT THE OLD MAN DECIDEDLY REFUSED THINKING HIMSELF BOUND IN HONOUR TO MY FRIEND WHO WHEN HE FOUND THE FATHER INEXORABLE QUITTED HIS COUNTRY NOR RETURNED UNTIL HE HEARD THAT HIS FORMER MISTRESS WAS MARRIED ACCORDING TO HER INCLINATIONS
THAT I PERCEIVED THE NECESSITY OF BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH MORE LANGUAGES THAN THAT OF MY NATIVE COUNTRY NOW I AM TWENTY EIGHT
HE IS SO GENTLE YET SO WISE HIS MIND IS SO CULTIVATED AND WHEN HE SPEAKS ALTHOUGH HIS WORDS ARE CULLED WITH THE CHOICEST ART YET THEY FLOW WITH RAPIDITY AND UNPARALLELED ELOQUENCE HE IS NOW MUCH RECOVERED FROM HIS ILLNESS
HE PLACED HIS HANDS BEFORE HIS EYES AND MY VOICE QUIVERED AND FAILED ME AS I BEHELD TEARS TRICKLE FAST
SOME YEARS AGO HE LOVED A YOUNG RUSSIAN LADY OF MODERATE FORTUNE AND HAVING AMASSED A CONSIDERABLE SUM IN PRIZE MONEY THE FATHER OF THE GIRL CONSENTED TO THE MATCH HE SAW HIS MISTRESS ONCE BEFORE THE DESTINED CEREMONY
NO ONE CAN FEEL MORE DEEPLY THAN HE DOES THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THE STARRY SKY THE SEA AND EVERY SIGHT AFFORDED BY THESE WONDERFUL REGIONS SEEM STILL TO HAVE THE POWER OF ELEVATING HIS SOUL FROM EARTH
THUS FAR I HAVE GONE TRACING A SECURE WAY OVER THE PATHLESS SEAS THE VERY STARS THEMSELVES BEING WITNESSES AND TESTIMONIES OF MY TRIUMPH WHY NOT STILL PROCEED OVER THE UNTAMED YET OBEDIENT ELEMENT
BUT IT AWAKENED VARIOUS TRAINS OF REFLECTION I SPOKE OF MY DESIRE OF FINDING A FRIEND OF MY THIRST FOR A MORE INTIMATE SYMPATHY WITH A FELLOW MIND THAN HAD EVER FALLEN TO MY LOT AND EXPRESSED MY CONVICTION THAT A MAN
WHEN HE EMBARKS IN A LITTLE BOAT WITH HIS HOLIDAY MATES ON AN EXPEDITION OF DISCOVERY UP HIS NATIVE RIVER BUT SUPPOSING ALL THESE CONJECTURES TO BE FALSE YOU CANNOT CONTEST THE INESTIMABLE BENEFIT WHICH I SHALL CONFER ON ALL MANKIND
WE ACCORDINGLY BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE DECK AND RESTORED HIM TO ANIMATION BY RUBBING HIM WITH BRANDY AND FORCING HIM TO SWALLOW A SMALL QUANTITY AS SOON AS HE SHOWED SIGNS OF LIFE WE WRAPPED HIM UP IN BLANKETS
HE HAS FREQUENTLY CONVERSED WITH ME ON MINE WHICH I HAVE COMMUNICATED TO HIM WITHOUT DISGUISE HE ENTERED ATTENTIVELY INTO ALL MY ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF MY EVENTUAL SUCCESS AND INTO EVERY MINUTE DETAIL OF THE MEASURES I HAD TAKEN TO SECURE IT
A GROAN BURST FROM HIS HEAVING BREAST I PAUSED AT LENGTH HE SPOKE IN BROKEN ACCENTS UNHAPPY MAN DO YOU SHARE MY MADNESS HAVE YOU DRUNK ALSO OF THE INTOXICATING DRAUGHT
AND DID THE MAN WHOM YOU PURSUED TRAVEL IN THE SAME FASHION YES THEN I FANCY WE HAVE SEEN HIM FOR THE DAY BEFORE WE PICKED YOU UP WE SAW SOME DOGS DRAWING A SLEDGE WITH A MAN IN IT
HEAR ME LET ME REVEAL MY TALE AND YOU WILL DASH THE CUP FROM YOUR LIPS SUCH WORDS YOU MAY IMAGINE STRONGLY EXCITED MY CURIOSITY
I MAY THERE DISCOVER THE WONDROUS POWER WHICH ATTRACTS THE NEEDLE AND MAY REGULATE A THOUSAND CELESTIAL OBSERVATIONS THAT REQUIRE ONLY THIS VOYAGE TO RENDER THEIR SEEMING ECCENTRICITIES CONSISTENT FOREVER
YOU HAVE BEEN TUTORED AND REFINED BY BOOKS AND RETIREMENT FROM THE WORLD AND YOU ARE THEREFORE SOMEWHAT FASTIDIOUS BUT THIS ONLY RENDERS YOU THE MORE FIT TO APPRECIATE THE EXTRAORDINARY MERITS OF THIS WONDERFUL MAN SOMETIMES
AND THE ABSENCE OF THE OBJECT OF WHICH I NOW FEEL AS A MOST SEVERE EVIL I HAVE NO FRIEND MARGARET WHEN I AM GLOWING WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF SUCCESS THERE WILL BE NONE TO PARTICIPATE MY JOY
WHICH CAN EASILY BE DONE BY PAYING THE INSURANCE FOR THE OWNER AND TO ENGAGE AS MANY SAILORS AS I THINK NECESSARY AMONG THOSE WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO THE WHALE FISHING I DO NOT INTEND TO SAIL UNTIL THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WHEN SHALL I RETURN
FEARING TO ENCOUNTER IN THE DARK THOSE LARGE LOOSE MASSES WHICH FLOAT ABOUT AFTER THE BREAKING UP OF THE ICE I PROFITED OF THIS TIME TO REST FOR A FEW HOURS IN THE MORNING HOWEVER AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT
I MUST OWN I FELT A LITTLE PROUD WHEN MY CAPTAIN OFFERED ME THE SECOND DIGNITY IN THE VESSEL AND ENTREATED ME TO REMAIN WITH THE GREATEST EARNESTNESS SO VALUABLE DID HE CONSIDER MY SERVICES AND NOW DEAR MARGARET
I ALSO BECAME A POET AND FOR ONE YEAR LIVED IN A PARADISE OF MY OWN CREATION I IMAGINED THAT I ALSO MIGHT OBTAIN A NICHE IN THE TEMPLE WHERE THE NAMES OF HOMER AND SHAKESPEARE ARE CONSECRATED YOU ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH MY FAILURE
WHICH HAD DRIFTED TOWARDS US IN THE NIGHT ON A LARGE FRAGMENT OF ICE ONLY ONE DOG REMAINED ALIVE BUT THERE WAS A HUMAN BEING WITHIN IT WHOM THE SAILORS WERE PERSUADING TO ENTER THE VESSEL HE WAS NOT AS THE OTHER TRAVELLER SEEMED TO BE
DO I NOT DESERVE TO ACCOMPLISH SOME GREAT PURPOSE MY LIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PASSED IN EASE AND LUXURY BUT I PREFERRED GLORY TO EVERY ENTICEMENT THAT WEALTH PLACED IN MY PATH
WITH THE EVER VARIED POWERS OF NATURE NOR CAN I DOUBT BUT THAT MY TALE CONVEYS IN ITS SERIES INTERNAL EVIDENCE OF THE TRUTH OF THE EVENTS OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED
THE COLD IS NOT EXCESSIVE IF YOU ARE WRAPPED IN FURS A DRESS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED FOR THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WALKING THE DECK AND REMAINING SEATED MOTIONLESS FOR HOURS WHEN NO EXERCISE PREVENTS THE BLOOD FROM ACTUALLY FREEZING IN YOUR VEINS
DO NOT LEND HIS AID TO PERFECTIONATE OUR WEAK AND FAULTY NATURES I ONCE HAD A FRIEND THE MOST NOBLE OF HUMAN CREATURES AND AM ENTITLED THEREFORE TO JUDGE RESPECTING FRIENDSHIP YOU HAVE HOPE
WE PERCEIVED A LOW CARRIAGE FIXED ON A SLEDGE AND DRAWN BY DOGS PASS ON TOWARDS THE NORTH AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE A BEING WHICH HAD THE SHAPE OF A MAN
MY AFFECTION FOR MY GUEST INCREASES EVERY DAY HE EXCITES AT ONCE MY ADMIRATION AND MY PITY TO AN ASTONISHING DEGREE HOW CAN I SEE SO NOBLE A CREATURE DESTROYED BY MISERY WITHOUT FEELING THE MOST POIGNANT GRIEF
A SAVAGE INHABITANT OF SOME UNDISCOVERED ISLAND BUT A EUROPEAN WHEN I APPEARED ON DECK THE MASTER SAID HERE IS OUR CAPTAIN AND HE WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO PERISH ON THE OPEN SEA ON PERCEIVING ME THE STRANGER ADDRESSED ME IN ENGLISH
AND I FEEL MY HEART GLOW WITH AN ENTHUSIASM WHICH ELEVATES ME TO HEAVEN FOR NOTHING CONTRIBUTES SO MUCH TO TRANQUILLIZE THE MIND AS A STEADY PURPOSE A POINT ON WHICH THE SOUL MAY FIX ITS INTELLECTUAL EYE
AND THOSE BRANCHES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE FROM WHICH A NAVAL ADVENTURER MIGHT DERIVE THE GREATEST PRACTICAL ADVANTAGE TWICE I ACTUALLY HIRED MYSELF AS AN UNDER MATE IN A GREENLAND WHALER AND ACQUITTED MYSELF TO ADMIRATION
BUT HE BESTOWED THE WHOLE ON HIS RIVAL TOGETHER WITH THE REMAINS OF HIS PRIZE MONEY TO PURCHASE STOCK AND THEN HIMSELF SOLICITED THE YOUNG WOMAN'S FATHER TO CONSENT TO HER MARRIAGE WITH HER LOVER
BUT THEY WANT AS THE PAINTERS CALL IT KEEPING AND I GREATLY NEED A FRIEND WHO WOULD HAVE SENSE ENOUGH NOT TO DESPISE ME AS ROMANTIC AND AFFECTION ENOUGH FOR ME TO ENDEAVOUR TO REGULATE MY MIND WELL
BUT APPARENTLY OF GIGANTIC STATURE SAT IN THE SLEDGE AND GUIDED THE DOGS WE WATCHED THE RAPID PROGRESS OF THE TRAVELLER WITH OUR TELESCOPES UNTIL HE WAS LOST AMONG THE DISTANT INEQUALITIES OF THE ICE
THERE SNOW AND FROST ARE BANISHED AND SAILING OVER A CALM SEA WE MAY BE WAFTED TO A LAND SURPASSING IN WONDERS AND IN BEAUTY EVERY REGION HITHERTO DISCOVERED ON THE HABITABLE GLOBE ITS PRODUCTIONS AND FEATURES
I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO DISCOVER WHAT QUALITY IT IS WHICH HE POSSESSES THAT ELEVATES HIM SO IMMEASURABLY ABOVE ANY OTHER PERSON I EVER KNEW
I SEE HIS THIN HAND RAISED IN ANIMATION WHILE THE LINEAMENTS OF HIS FACE ARE IRRADIATED BY THE SOUL WITHIN STRANGE AND HARROWING MUST BE HIS STORY
INSPIRITED BY THIS WIND OF PROMISE MY DAYDREAMS BECOME MORE FERVENT AND VIVID I TRY IN VAIN TO BE PERSUADED THAT THE POLE IS THE SEAT OF FROST AND DESOLATION IT EVER PRESENTS ITSELF TO MY IMAGINATION AS THE REGION OF BEAUTY AND DELIGHT
TO THE LAST GENERATION BY DISCOVERING A PASSAGE NEAR THE POLE TO THOSE COUNTRIES TO REACH WHICH AT PRESENT SO MANY MONTHS ARE REQUISITE OR BY ASCERTAINING THE SECRET OF THE MAGNET
MY GENEROUS FRIEND REASSURED THE SUPPLIANT AND ON BEING INFORMED OF THE NAME OF HER LOVER INSTANTLY ABANDONED HIS PURSUIT HE HAD ALREADY BOUGHT A FARM WITH HIS MONEY ON WHICH HE HAD DESIGNED TO PASS THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE
I DARE NOT EXPECT SUCH SUCCESS YET I CANNOT BEAR TO LOOK ON THE REVERSE OF THE PICTURE CONTINUE FOR THE PRESENT TO WRITE TO ME BY EVERY OPPORTUNITY
ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK THE MIST CLEARED AWAY AND WE BEHELD STRETCHED OUT IN EVERY DIRECTION VAST AND IRREGULAR PLAINS OF ICE WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE NO END
WHICH IF AT ALL POSSIBLE CAN ONLY BE EFFECTED BY AN UNDERTAKING SUCH AS MINE THESE REFLECTIONS HAVE DISPELLED THE AGITATION WITH WHICH I BEGAN MY LETTER
MAY BE WITHOUT EXAMPLE AS THE PHENOMENA OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES UNDOUBTEDLY ARE IN THOSE UNDISCOVERED SOLITUDES WHAT MAY NOT BE EXPECTED IN A COUNTRY OF ETERNAL LIGHT
I DO NOT KNOW THAT THE RELATION OF MY DISASTERS WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU YET WHEN I REFLECT THAT YOU ARE PURSUING THE SAME COURSE EXPOSING YOURSELF TO THE SAME DANGERS WHICH HAVE RENDERED ME WHAT I AM
THE STRANGER HAS GRADUALLY IMPROVED IN HEALTH BUT IS VERY SILENT AND APPEARS UNEASY WHEN ANYONE EXCEPT MYSELF ENTERS HIS CABIN YET HIS MANNERS ARE SO CONCILIATING AND GENTLE THAT THE SAILORS ARE ALL INTERESTED IN HIM
I HAVE DOUBTLESS EXCITED YOUR CURIOSITY AS WELL AS THAT OF THESE GOOD PEOPLE BUT YOU ARE TOO CONSIDERATE TO MAKE INQUIRIES CERTAINLY IT WOULD INDEED BE VERY IMPERTINENT AND INHUMAN IN ME
YOU WILL SMILE AT MY ALLUSION BUT I WILL DISCLOSE A SECRET I HAVE OFTEN ATTRIBUTED MY ATTACHMENT TO MY PASSIONATE ENTHUSIASM FOR THE DANGEROUS MYSTERIES OF OCEAN TO THAT PRODUCTION
I DESIRE THE COMPANY OF A MAN WHO COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH ME WHOSE EYES WOULD REPLY TO MINE YOU MAY DEEM ME ROMANTIC MY DEAR SISTER BUT I BITTERLY FEEL THE WANT OF A FRIEND I HAVE NO ONE NEAR ME
I AM REQUIRED NOT ONLY TO RAISE THE SPIRITS OF OTHERS BUT SOMETIMES TO SUSTAIN MY OWN WHEN THEIRS ARE FAILING THIS IS THE MOST FAVOURABLE PERIOD FOR TRAVELLING IN RUSSIA THEY FLY QUICKLY OVER THE SNOW IN THEIR SLEDGES THE MOTION IS PLEASANT
WHO MAY NOT SEE MY NATIVE LAND PERHAPS FOR MANY YEARS I AM HOWEVER IN GOOD SPIRITS MY MEN ARE BOLD AND APPARENTLY FIRM OF PURPOSE NOR DO THE FLOATING SHEETS OF ICE THAT CONTINUALLY PASS US
I ARRIVED HERE YESTERDAY AND MY FIRST TASK IS TO ASSURE MY DEAR SISTER OF MY WELFARE AND INCREASING CONFIDENCE IN THE SUCCESS OF MY UNDERTAKING I AM ALREADY FAR NORTH OF LONDON AND AS I WALK IN THE STREETS OF PETERSBURGH
THESE ARE USELESS COMPLAINTS
BEING EVEN NOW IN WRECK SO ATTRACTIVE AND AMIABLE I SAID IN ONE OF MY LETTERS MY DEAR MARGARET THAT I SHOULD FIND NO FRIEND ON THE WIDE OCEAN YET I HAVE FOUND A MAN WHO BEFORE HIS SPIRIT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY MISERY
WHICH WHILE IT RENDERS HIS CONDUCT THE MORE ASTONISHING DETRACTS FROM THE INTEREST AND SYMPATHY WHICH OTHERWISE HE WOULD COMMAND YET DO NOT SUPPOSE BECAUSE I COMPLAIN A LITTLE OR BECAUSE I CAN CONCEIVE A CONSOLATION FOR MY TOILS
PARTLY FROM CURIOSITY AND PARTLY FROM A STRONG DESIRE TO AMELIORATE HIS FATE IF IT WERE IN MY POWER I EXPRESSED THESE FEELINGS IN MY ANSWER I THANK YOU HE REPLIED FOR YOUR SYMPATHY BUT IT IS USELESS
