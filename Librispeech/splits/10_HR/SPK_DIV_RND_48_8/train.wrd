HIS MARRYING MISS THORPE IS NOT PROBABLE I THINK YOU MUST BE DECEIVED SO FAR I AM VERY SORRY FOR MISTER MORLAND SORRY THAT ANYONE YOU LOVE SHOULD BE UNHAPPY BUT MY SURPRISE WOULD BE GREATER
I WROTE THE WORD FINIS AT THE END OF THE SIXTY EIGHTH STRIP ABOUT A WEEK AGO I HAVE TORN UP TWO OF MY SHIRTS AND AS MANY HANDKERCHIEFS AS I WAS MASTER OF TO COMPLETE THE PRECIOUS PAGES
I HEMMED THE EDGES OVER AGAIN WITH WHAT WITH THIS NEEDLE SAID THE ABBE AS OPENING HIS RAGGED VESTMENTS HE SHOWED DANTES A LONG SHARP FISH BONE WITH A SMALL PERFORATED EYE FOR THE THREAD A SMALL PORTION OF WHICH STILL REMAINED IN IT
I SUPPOSE HE WILL HARDLY EVER RECOVER IT YOUR BROTHER IS CERTAINLY VERY MUCH TO BE PITIED AT PRESENT BUT WE MUST NOT IN OUR CONCERN FOR HIS SUFFERINGS UNDERVALUE YOURS YOU FEEL I SUPPOSE THAT IN LOSING ISABELLA
THAN IF I POSSESSED A WATCH FOR THAT MIGHT BE BROKEN OR DERANGED IN ITS MOVEMENTS WHILE THE SUN AND EARTH NEVER VARY IN THEIR APPOINTED PATHS THIS LAST EXPLANATION WAS WHOLLY LOST UPON DANTES WHO HAD ALWAYS IMAGINED
I TOLD YOU HOW I MANAGED TO OBTAIN THAT AND I ONLY JUST MAKE IT FROM TIME TO TIME AS I REQUIRE IT ONE THING STILL PUZZLES ME OBSERVED DANTES AND THAT IS HOW YOU MANAGED TO DO ALL THIS BY DAYLIGHT
I HAVE ONE FAVOUR TO BEG SAID CATHERINE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS IN AN AGITATED MANNER THAT IF YOUR BROTHER SHOULD BE COMING HERE YOU WILL GIVE ME NOTICE OF IT THAT I MAY GO AWAY OUR BROTHER FREDERICK YES
I WOULD FAIN FIX THE SOURCE OF IT ON MAN THAT I MAY NO LONGER VENT REPROACHES UPON HEAVEN
ASKED THE ABBE OH YOUR GREAT WORK ON THE MONARCHY OF ITALY
WHICH HE COULD JUST RECOLLECT HAVING VISITED DURING A VOYAGE MADE IN HIS EARLIEST YOUTH
AND WERE AT THAT MOMENT DEEP IN CONSULTATION ABOUT HER SHE DREW BACK TRYING TO BEG THEIR PARDON BUT WAS WITH GENTLE VIOLENCE FORCED TO RETURN AND THE OTHERS WITHDREW
THE ANXIETIES OF COMMON LIFE BEGAN SOON TO SUCCEED TO THE ALARMS OF ROMANCE HER DESIRE OF HEARING FROM ISABELLA GREW EVERY DAY GREATER SHE WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO KNOW HOW THE BATH WORLD WENT ON AND HOW THE ROOMS WERE ATTENDED
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ABBE'S CHAMBER AFTER HAVING PASSED WITH TOLERABLE EASE THROUGH THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE WHICH HOWEVER DID NOT ADMIT OF THEIR HOLDING THEMSELVES ERECT THE TWO FRIENDS REACHED THE FURTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR
AND DIVIDED AT THE NIB LIKE AN ORDINARY PEN DANTES EXAMINED IT WITH INTENSE ADMIRATION THEN LOOKED AROUND TO SEE THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN SHAPED SO CORRECTLY INTO FORM AH YES SAID FARIA THE PENKNIFE
HIS INTERVIEW WITH THAT PERSONAGE AND HIS RECEIVING IN PLACE OF THE PACKET BROUGHT A LETTER ADDRESSED TO A MONSIEUR NOIRTIER HIS ARRIVAL AT MARSEILLES AND INTERVIEW WITH HIS FATHER HIS AFFECTION FOR MERCEDES AND THEIR NUPTUAL FEAST
CHARMING AS WERE ALL MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S WORKS AND CHARMING EVEN AS WERE THE WORKS OF ALL HER IMITATORS IT WAS NOT IN THEM PERHAPS THAT HUMAN NATURE AT LEAST IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WAS TO BE LOOKED FOR
JAMES ONLY MEANS TO GIVE ME GOOD ADVICE HE GLADLY RECEIVED THE LETTER AND HAVING READ IT THROUGH WITH CLOSE ATTENTION RETURNED IT SAYING WELL IF IT IS TO BE SO I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I AM SORRY FOR IT
THEN IN HER LAP AND THEN IN HER POCKET AND SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE KNEW NOT WHAT SHE DID THE GENERAL BETWEEN HIS COCOA AND HIS NEWSPAPER HAD LUCKILY NO LEISURE FOR NOTICING HER BUT TO THE OTHER TWO HER DISTRESS WAS EQUALLY VISIBLE
AND SHE DID NOT LOVE THE SIGHT OF JAPAN IN ANY SHAPE BUT EVEN SHE COULD ALLOW THAT AN OCCASIONAL MEMENTO OF PAST FOLLY HOWEVER PAINFUL MIGHT NOT BE WITHOUT USE
I SHALL NOT ENTER INTO PARTICULARS THEY WOULD ONLY PAIN YOU MORE YOU WILL SOON HEAR ENOUGH FROM ANOTHER QUARTER TO KNOW WHERE LIES THE BLAME
THAN THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL A VOLUNTARY SELF CREATED DELUSION EACH TRIFLING CIRCUMSTANCE RECEIVING IMPORTANCE FROM AN IMAGINATION RESOLVED ON ALARM AND EVERYTHING FORCED TO BEND TO ONE PURPOSE BY A MIND WHICH
WHAT WAS HER FATHER A LAWYER I BELIEVE THEY LIVE AT PUTNEY ARE THEY A WEALTHY FAMILY NO NOT VERY I DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA HAS ANY FORTUNE AT ALL BUT THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY IN YOUR FAMILY
SUCH A FRIEND AS ISABELLA HAD BEEN TO HER AND THEN THEIR OWN BROTHER SO CLOSELY CONCERNED IN IT SHE BELIEVED SHE MUST WAIVE THE SUBJECT ALTOGETHER HENRY AND ELEANOR WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND EACH AS SHE ENTERED IT
HOWEVER I DISCOVERED THAT I SHOULD MERELY HAVE DROPPED INTO A SORT OF INNER COURT AND I THEREFORE RENOUNCED THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER AS TOO FULL OF RISK AND DANGER NEVERTHELESS I CAREFULLY PRESERVED MY LADDER
SO THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINISH MY WORK HERE AND WAS IT NOT DISCOVERED THAT YOUR SHEETS WERE UNHEMMED
WHAT SHE WOULD BE AT FOR THERE COULD BE NO NEED OF MY BEING PLAYED OFF TO MAKE HER SECURE OF TILNEY WE PARTED AT LAST BY MUTUAL CONSENT HAPPY FOR ME HAD WE NEVER MET
ONE COULD CUT AND THRUST DANTES EXAMINED THE VARIOUS ARTICLES SHOWN TO HIM WITH THE SAME ATTENTION THAT HE HAD BESTOWED ON THE CURIOSITIES AND STRANGE TOOLS EXHIBITED IN THE SHOPS AT MARSEILLES
LOOKED AT HER ANXIOUSLY CATHERINE TOOK HER PLACE AT THE TABLE AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ELEANOR SAID NO BAD NEWS FROM FULLERTON I HOPE MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS I HOPE THEY ARE NONE OF THEM ILL
DEAREST CATHERINE BEWARE HOW YOU GIVE YOUR HEART
IN SHORT SHE MADE HERSELF AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WENT DOWN WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK FIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL
AFTER ELEANOR HAD AFFECTIONATELY EXPRESSED A WISH OF BEING OF USE OR COMFORT TO HER AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S FREE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF AND REFLECTION CATHERINE FELT EQUAL TO ENCOUNTERING HER FRIENDS
OF WHICH DANTES HAD WITNESSED THE COMPLETION AS HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER OF HIS FRIEND DANTES CAST AROUND ONE EAGER AND SEARCHING GLANCE IN QUEST OF THE EXPECTED MARVELS BUT NOTHING MORE THAN COMMON MET HIS VIEW IT IS WELL
THE LIBERTY WHICH HER IMAGINATION HAD DARED TO TAKE WITH THE CHARACTER OF HIS FATHER COULD HE EVER FORGIVE IT THE ABSURDITY OF HER CURIOSITY AND HER FEARS COULD THEY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
INTO WHICH THE ABBE'S CELL OPENED FROM THAT POINT THE PASSAGE BECAME MUCH NARROWER AND BARELY PERMITTED ONE TO CREEP THROUGH ON HANDS AND KNEES THE FLOOR OF THE ABBE'S CELL WAS PAVED AND IT HAD BEEN BY RAISING ONE OF THE STONES IN THE MOST OBSCURE CORNER
SHOULD I EVER GET OUT OF PRISON AND FIND IN ALL ITALY A PRINTER COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO PUBLISH WHAT I HAVE COMPOSED MY LITERARY REPUTATION IS FOREVER SECURED I SEE ANSWERED DANTES
SHE HATED HERSELF MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS HE HAD SHE THOUGHT HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE THIS FATAL MORNING SHOWN SOMETHING LIKE AFFECTION FOR HER BUT NOW
AND EVERYTHING THAT IS BAD IN THE WORLD I HOPE SO FAR AS CONCERNS MY BROTHER YOU ARE MISINFORMED I HOPE HE HAS NOT HAD ANY MATERIAL SHARE IN BRINGING ON MISTER MORLAND'S DISAPPOINTMENT
CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE
WHO SUPPLIED YOU WITH THE MATERIALS FOR MAKING THIS WONDERFUL WORK I TORE UP SEVERAL OF MY SHIRTS AND RIPPED OUT THE SEAMS IN THE SHEETS OF MY BED DURING MY THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT AT FENESTRELLE
BUT SHE LEARNED TO HOPE THAT IT WOULD NEVER TRANSPIRE FARTHER AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT COST HER HENRY'S ENTIRE REGARD HER THOUGHTS BEING STILL CHIEFLY FIXED ON WHAT SHE HAD WITH SUCH CAUSELESS TERROR FELT AND DONE NOTHING COULD SHORTLY BE CLEARER
AS WELL AS MAKE OUT THE SENSE IT BEING IN ITALIAN
BUT WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF THE ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE TO INDIA AND TWO OR THREE VOYAGES TO THE LEVANT UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE RECITAL OF HIS LAST CRUISE WITH THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN LECLERE AND THE RECEIPT OF A PACKET TO BE DELIVERED BY HIMSELF TO THE GRAND MARSHAL
SHE THANKED HIM AS HEARTILY AS IF HE HAD WRITTEN IT HIMSELF TIS ONLY FROM JAMES HOWEVER AS SHE LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION SHE OPENED IT IT WAS FROM OXFORD AND TO THIS PURPOSE DEAR CATHERINE
UPON THE ENORMOUS DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ABILITY YOU MUST HAVE EMPLOYED TO REACH THE HIGH PERFECTION TO WHICH YOU HAVE ATTAINED WHAT WOULD YOU NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IF YOU HAD BEEN FREE POSSIBLY NOTHING AT ALL THE OVERFLOW OF MY BRAIN WOULD PROBABLY
BUT PERHAPS OBSERVED CATHERINE THOUGH SHE HAS BEHAVED SO ILL BY OUR FAMILY SHE MAY BEHAVE BETTER BY YOURS NOW SHE HAS REALLY GOT THE MAN SHE LIKES SHE MAY BE CONSTANT
THAT I AM NEVER TO HEAR FROM HER PERHAPS NEVER TO SEE HER AGAIN
AS THE WORKS OF THE SAVAGES IN THE SOUTH SEAS FROM WHENCE THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY THE DIFFERENT TRADING VESSELS AS FOR THE INK
LAID ONE OVER THE OTHER LIKE FOLDS OF PAPYRUS THESE ROLLS CONSISTED OF SLIPS OF CLOTH ABOUT FOUR INCHES WIDE AND EIGHTEEN LONG THEY WERE ALL CAREFULLY NUMBERED AND CLOSELY COVERED WITH WRITING SO LEGIBLE THAT DANTES COULD EASILY READ IT
INCONCEIVABLE HENRY FREDERICK TOO WHO ALWAYS WORE HIS HEART SO PROUDLY
AS SOON AS SHE DARED LEAVE THE TABLE SHE HURRIED AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM BUT THE HOUSEMAIDS WERE BUSY IN IT AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO COME DOWN AGAIN SHE TURNED INTO THE DRAWING ROOM FOR PRIVACY BUT HENRY AND ELEANOR HAD LIKEWISE RETREATED THITHER
AND UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE NEED NOT FEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME ACTUAL SPECKS IN THE CHARACTER OF THEIR FATHER WHO THOUGH CLEARED FROM THE GROSSLY INJURIOUS SUSPICIONS WHICH SHE MUST EVER BLUSH TO HAVE ENTERTAINED SHE DID BELIEVE
YOU WOULD NOT FOR INSTANCE NOW GO TO A BALL FOR THE WORLD YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NO LONGER ANY FRIEND TO WHOM YOU CAN SPEAK WITH UNRESERVE ON WHOSE REGARD YOU CAN PLACE DEPENDENCE OR WHOSE COUNSEL
AND MATCHES I PRETENDED THAT I HAD A DISORDER OF THE SKIN AND ASKED FOR A LITTLE SULPHUR WHICH WAS READILY SUPPLIED DANTES LAID THE DIFFERENT THINGS HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT ON THE TABLE AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAD DROOPING ON HIS BREAST
AND ESPECIALLY WAS SHE ANXIOUS TO BE ASSURED OF ISABELLA'S HAVING MATCHED SOME FINE NETTING COTTON ON WHICH SHE HAD LEFT HER INTENT AND OF HER CONTINUING ON THE BEST TERMS WITH JAMES
IT IS ALL OVER WITH FREDERICK INDEED HE IS A DECEASED MAN DEFUNCT IN UNDERSTANDING PREPARE FOR YOUR SISTER IN LAW ELEANOR AND SUCH A SISTER IN LAW AS YOU MUST DELIGHT IN OPEN CANDID
THE FORMIDABLE HENRY SOON FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER WAS THAT HE PAID HER RATHER MORE ATTENTION THAN USUAL CATHERINE HAD NEVER WANTED COMFORT MORE AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS AWARE OF IT
ARTLESS GUILELESS WITH AFFECTIONS STRONG BUT SIMPLE FORMING NO PRETENSIONS AND KNOWING NO DISGUISE SUCH A SISTER IN LAW HENRY I SHOULD DELIGHT IN SAID ELEANOR WITH A SMILE
THEY PUT THE STONE BACK IN ITS PLACE THE ABBE SPRINKLED A LITTLE DUST OVER IT TO CONCEAL THE TRACES OF ITS HAVING BEEN REMOVED RUBBED HIS FOOT WELL ON IT TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE SAME APPEARANCE AS THE OTHER AND THEN GOING TOWARDS HIS BED
LONG BEFORE HER QUITTING BATH AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT OF READING WHICH SHE HAD THERE INDULGED
AFTER PARADING THE ROOM TILL THEY WERE TIRED AND HOW PLEASANT IT WOULD BE IF WE HAD ANY ACQUAINTANCE HERE
OF A COMMANDING ASPECT PAST THE BLOOM BUT NOT PAST THE VIGOUR OF LIFE AND WITH HIS EYE STILL DIRECTED TOWARDS HER SHE SAW HIM PRESENTLY ADDRESS MISTER TILNEY IN A FAMILIAR WHISPER
AND A VERY INDULGENT MOTHER HER ELDEST DAUGHTER HAD GREAT PERSONAL BEAUTY AND THE YOUNGER ONES BY PRETENDING TO BE AS HANDSOME AS THEIR SISTER IMITATING HER AIR AND DRESSING IN THE SAME STYLE DID VERY WELL
IN WHICH THE WORTHLESSNESS OF LORDS AND ATTORNEYS MIGHT BE SET FORTH
AND ALL OUR AGREEABLENESS BELONGS SOLELY TO EACH OTHER FOR THAT TIME NOBODY CAN FASTEN THEMSELVES ON THE NOTICE OF ONE WITHOUT INJURING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER I CONSIDER A COUNTRY DANCE AS AN EMBLEM OF MARRIAGE
NOR AN EXPRESSION USED BY EITHER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MADE AND USED SOME THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE UNDER THAT ROOF IN EVERY BATH SEASON
FOR IF I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TALK TO THEM AND BESIDES I DO NOT WANT TO TALK TO ANYBODY NOW YOU HAVE GIVEN ME A SECURITY WORTH HAVING AND I SHALL PROCEED WITH COURAGE
AND AGAIN SOLICITED TO DANCE BY MISTER TILNEY HIMSELF WITH WHAT SPARKLING EYES AND READY MOTION SHE GRANTED HIS REQUEST AND WITH HOW PLEASING A FLUTTER OF HEART SHE WENT WITH HIM TO THE SET MAY BE EASILY IMAGINED
FIDELITY AND COMPLAISANCE ARE THE PRINCIPAL DUTIES OF BOTH AND THOSE MEN WHO DO NOT CHOOSE TO DANCE OR MARRY THEMSELVES HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH THE PARTNERS OR WIVES OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THEY ARE SUCH VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
BEFORE A LADY OF ABOUT HER OWN AGE WHO WAS SITTING BY HER AND HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER ATTENTIVELY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES ADDRESSED HER WITH GREAT COMPLAISANCE IN THESE WORDS
SINCE THEY HAD BEEN CONTENTED TO KNOW NOTHING OF EACH OTHER FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS COMPLIMENTS ON GOOD LOOKS NOW PASSED AND AFTER OBSERVING HOW TIME HAD SLIPPED AWAY SINCE THEY WERE LAST TOGETHER
THE AGREEABLENESS THE COMPLIANCE ARE EXPECTED FROM HIM WHILE SHE FURNISHES THE FAN AND THE LAVENDER WATER THAT I SUPPOSE WAS THE DIFFERENCE OF DUTIES WHICH STRUCK YOU AS RENDERING THE CONDITIONS INCAPABLE OF COMPARISON
AND WHOM SHE INSTANTLY JOINED WITH A FIRMER DETERMINATION TO BE ACQUAINTED THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD COURAGE TO COMMAND HAD SHE NOT BEEN URGED BY THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE DAY BEFORE MISS TILNEY MET HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY
AND WAS NOW CHIEFLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID HIS SIGHT LEST HE SHOULD ENGAGE HER AGAIN FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT DARED NOT EXPECT THAT MISTER TILNEY SHOULD ASK HER A THIRD TIME TO DANCE
THIS WAS THE LAST SENTENCE BY WHICH HE COULD WEARY CATHERINE'S ATTENTION FOR HE WAS JUST THEN BORNE OFF BY THE RESISTLESS PRESSURE OF A LONG STRING OF PASSING LADIES HER PARTNER NOW DREW NEAR AND SAID
WELL OTHER PEOPLE MUST JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THOSE WHO GO TO LONDON MAY THINK NOTHING OF BATH BUT I WHO LIVE IN A SMALL RETIRED VILLAGE IN THE COUNTRY CAN NEVER FIND GREATER SAMENESS IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAN IN MY OWN HOME
AND THE HONEST RELISH OF BALLS AND PLAYS AND EVERYDAY SIGHTS IS PAST WITH THEM HERE THEIR CONVERSATION CLOSED THE DEMANDS OF THE DANCE BECOMING NOW TOO IMPORTUNATE FOR A DIVIDED ATTENTION
NEAR LONDON THE WHOLE BEING EXPLAINED MANY OBLIGING THINGS WERE SAID BY THE MISS THORPES OF THEIR WISH OF BEING BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HER OF BEING CONSIDERED AS ALREADY FRIENDS THROUGH THE FRIENDSHIP OF THEIR BROTHERS ET CETERA WHICH CATHERINE HEARD WITH PLEASURE
I ASSURE YOU MY BROTHER IS QUITE IN LOVE WITH YOU ALREADY AND AS FOR MISTER TILNEY BUT THAT IS A SETTLED THING EVEN YOUR MODESTY CANNOT DOUBT HIS ATTACHMENT NOW HIS COMING BACK TO BATH MAKES IT TOO PLAIN OH
AND TILL THE USUAL MOMENT OF GOING TO THE PUMP ROOM SHE FELT SOME ALARM FROM THE DREAD OF A SECOND PREVENTION BUT NOTHING OF THAT KIND OCCURRED NO VISITORS APPEARED TO DELAY THEM AND THEY ALL THREE SET OFF IN GOOD TIME FOR THE PUMP ROOM
HE NEVER COMES TO THE PUMP ROOM I SUPPOSE YES SOMETIMES BUT HE HAS RID OUT THIS MORNING WITH MY FATHER MISSUS HUGHES NOW JOINED THEM AND ASKED MISS TILNEY IF SHE WAS READY TO GO
THE COTILLIONS WERE OVER THE COUNTRY DANCING BEGINNING AND SHE SAW NOTHING OF THE TILNEYS DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED MY DEAR CATHERINE WHISPERED ISABELLA BUT I AM REALLY GOING TO DANCE WITH YOUR BROTHER AGAIN
AND WHEN SHE EXPATIATED ON THE TALENTS OF HER SONS AND THE BEAUTY OF HER DAUGHTERS WHEN SHE RELATED THEIR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND VIEWS THAT JOHN WAS AT OXFORD
NO INDEED I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEN I AM QUITE AT A LOSS ONE THING HOWEVER I MUST OBSERVE THIS DISPOSITION ON YOUR SIDE IS RATHER ALARMING
NOW MISTER MORLAND FOR HE WAS CLOSE TO HER ON THE OTHER SIDE I SHALL NOT SPEAK ANOTHER WORD TO YOU ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING SO I CHARGE YOU NOT TO EXPECT IT MY SWEETEST CATHERINE HOW HAVE YOU BEEN THIS LONG AGE
WHERE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF EVENTS AND CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE MISTER ALLEN AFTER DRINKING HIS GLASS OF WATER JOINED SOME GENTLEMEN TO TALK OVER THE POLITICS OF THE DAY AND COMPARE THE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR NEWSPAPERS
CONFUSED BY HIS NOTICE AND BLUSHING FROM THE FEAR OF ITS BEING EXCITED BY SOMETHING WRONG IN HER APPEARANCE SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD
TILNEY HE REPEATED HUM I DO NOT KNOW HIM A GOOD FIGURE OF A MAN WELL PUT TOGETHER
OH YES I SHALL NEVER BE IN WANT OF SOMETHING TO TALK OF AGAIN TO MISSUS ALLEN OR ANYBODY ELSE I REALLY BELIEVE I SHALL ALWAYS BE TALKING OF BATH WHEN I AM AT HOME AGAIN
BUT IT WOULD NOT ANSWER MY PURPOSE IT WOULD NOT DO FOR THE FIELD I WOULD GIVE ANY MONEY FOR A REAL GOOD HUNTER I HAVE THREE NOW THE BEST THAT EVER WERE BACKED I WOULD NOT TAKE EIGHT HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR THEM
AND SO I AM AT HOME ONLY I DO NOT FIND SO MUCH OF IT I WALK ABOUT HERE AND SO I DO THERE BUT HERE I SEE A VARIETY OF PEOPLE IN EVERY STREET AND THERE I CAN ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN
MISTER THORPE IS SUCH A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MY BROTHER'S THAT IF HE TALKS TO ME I MUST TALK TO HIM AGAIN BUT THERE ARE HARDLY THREE YOUNG MEN IN THE ROOM BESIDES HIM THAT I HAVE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH AND IS THAT TO BE MY ONLY SECURITY ALAS ALAS
IS HE IN THE HOUSE NOW LOOK ABOUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE I ASSURE YOU I CAN HARDLY EXIST TILL I SEE HIM NO SAID CATHERINE HE IS NOT HERE I CANNOT SEE HIM ANYWHERE OH HORRID
THE NEXT MORNING CATHERINE THEN RAN DIRECTLY UPSTAIRS AND WATCHED MISS THORPE'S PROGRESS DOWN THE STREET FROM THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW ADMIRED THE GRACEFUL SPIRIT OF HER WALK THE FASHIONABLE AIR OF HER
SHE ENTERED THE ROOMS ON THURSDAY EVENING WITH FEELINGS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAD ATTENDED HER THITHER THE MONDAY BEFORE
HER WISHES HOPES AND PLANS ALL CENTRED IN NOTHING LESS EVERY YOUNG LADY MAY FEEL FOR MY HEROINE IN THIS CRITICAL MOMENT FOR EVERY YOUNG LADY HAS AT SOME TIME OR OTHER KNOWN THE SAME AGITATION
EDWARD AT MERCHANT TAYLORS AND WILLIAM AT SEA AND ALL OF THEM MORE BELOVED AND RESPECTED IN THEIR DIFFERENT STATION THAN ANY OTHER THREE BEINGS EVER WERE
I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD BE TIRED IF I WERE TO STAY HERE SIX MONTHS BATH COMPARED WITH LONDON HAS LITTLE VARIETY AND SO EVERYBODY FINDS OUT EVERY YEAR FOR SIX WEEKS I ALLOW BATH IS PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT BEYOND THAT IT IS THE MOST TIRESOME PLACE IN THE WORLD
MISTER TILNEY WAS VERY MUCH AMUSED ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN HE REPEATED WHAT A PICTURE OF INTELLECTUAL POVERTY HOWEVER WHEN YOU SINK INTO THIS ABYSS AGAIN YOU WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY
THE TALLEST IS ISABELLA MY ELDEST IS NOT SHE A FINE YOUNG WOMAN THE OTHERS ARE VERY MUCH ADMIRED TOO BUT I BELIEVE ISABELLA IS THE HANDSOMEST
A FAMOUS CLEVER ANIMAL FOR THE ROAD ONLY FORTY GUINEAS I HAD FIFTY MINDS TO BUY IT MYSELF
UP THE STEPS AND DOWN PEOPLE WHOM NOBODY CARED ABOUT AND NOBODY WANTED TO SEE AND HE ONLY WAS ABSENT WHAT A DELIGHTFUL PLACE BATH IS SAID MISSUS ALLEN AS THEY SAT DOWN NEAR THE GREAT CLOCK
THE MISS THORPES WERE INTRODUCED AND MISS MORLAND WHO HAD BEEN FOR A SHORT TIME FORGOTTEN WAS INTRODUCED LIKEWISE THE NAME SEEMED TO STRIKE THEM ALL AND AFTER SPEAKING TO HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY
OR SOME NONSENSE OF THAT KIND WHICH WOULD HAVE DISTRESSED ME BEYOND CONCEPTION
ATTENTION TO HIS WORDS AND PERFECT RELIANCE ON THEIR TRUTH WITH REAL INTEREST AND STRONG ADMIRATION DID HER EYE NOW FOLLOW THE GENERAL AS HE MOVED THROUGH THE CROWD AND HOW HANDSOME A FAMILY THEY ARE WAS HER SECRET REMARK
WAS REPEATED BY THEM ALL TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER FOR A MOMENT CATHERINE WAS SURPRISED BUT MISSUS THORPE AND HER DAUGHTERS HAD SCARCELY BEGUN THE HISTORY OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER JAMES MORLAND
FAR MORE READY TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND EACH HEARING VERY LITTLE OF WHAT THE OTHER SAID MISSUS THORPE HOWEVER HAD ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE AS A TALKER OVER MISSUS ALLEN IN A FAMILY OF CHILDREN
HAD NOT THE EASY GAIETY OF MISS THORPE'S MANNERS AND HER FREQUENT EXPRESSIONS OF DELIGHT ON THIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER SOFTENED DOWN EVERY FEELING OF AWE AND LEFT NOTHING BUT TENDER AFFECTION
TO ESCAPE AND AS SHE BELIEVED SO NARROWLY ESCAPE JOHN THORPE AND TO BE ASKED SO IMMEDIATELY ON HIS JOINING HER ASKED BY MISTER TILNEY AS IF HE HAD SOUGHT HER ON PURPOSE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HER THAT LIFE COULD SUPPLY ANY GREATER FELICITY
CONSOLING HERSELF HOWEVER WITH THE DISCOVERY WHICH HER KEEN EYE SOON MADE
EACH TO ENDEAVOUR TO GIVE THE OTHER NO CAUSE FOR WISHING THAT HE OR SHE HAD BESTOWED THEMSELVES ELSEWHERE AND THEIR BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THEIR OWN IMAGINATIONS FROM WANDERING TOWARDS THE PERFECTIONS OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS
WITH MORE THAN USUAL EAGERNESS DID CATHERINE HASTEN TO THE PUMP ROOM THE NEXT DAY SECURE WITHIN HERSELF OF SEEING MISTER TILNEY THERE BEFORE THE MORNING WERE OVER AND READY TO MEET HIM WITH A SMILE BUT NO SMILE WAS DEMANDED
NEATNESS AND FASHION ARE ENOUGH FOR THE FORMER AND A SOMETHING OF SHABBINESS OR IMPROPRIETY WILL BE MOST ENDEARING TO THE LATTER BUT NOT ONE OF THESE GRAVE REFLECTIONS TROUBLED THE TRANQUILLITY OF CATHERINE
HOW WELL YOUR BROTHER DANCES WAS AN ARTLESS EXCLAMATION OF CATHERINE'S TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THEIR CONVERSATION WHICH AT ONCE SURPRISED AND AMUSED HER COMPANION HENRY SHE REPLIED WITH A SMILE YES HE DOES DANCE VERY WELL
NO INDEED I SHOULD NOT OH YES YOU WOULD INDEED I KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
AND ALMOST FORGOT MISTER TILNEY WHILE SHE TALKED TO MISS THORPE FRIENDSHIP IS CERTAINLY THE FINEST BALM FOR THE PANGS OF DISAPPOINTED LOVE THEIR CONVERSATION TURNED UPON THOSE SUBJECTS OF WHICH THE FREE DISCUSSION HAS GENERALLY MUCH TO DO IN PERFECTING A SUDDEN INTIMACY BETWEEN TWO YOUNG LADIES
TILL CATHERINE BEGAN TO DOUBT THE HAPPINESS OF A SITUATION WHICH CONFINING HER ENTIRELY TO HER FRIEND AND BROTHER GAVE HER VERY LITTLE SHARE IN THE NOTICE OF EITHER THEY WERE ALWAYS ENGAGED IN SOME SENTIMENTAL DISCUSSION OR LIVELY DISPUTE
THIS SENTIMENT HAD BEEN UTTERED SO OFTEN IN VAIN THAT MISSUS ALLEN HAD NO PARTICULAR REASON TO HOPE IT WOULD BE FOLLOWED WITH MORE ADVANTAGE NOW BUT WE ARE TOLD TO DESPAIR OF NOTHING WE WOULD ATTAIN AS UNWEARIED
AND ESPECIALLY AS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE VERY FAMILY WE ARE JUST GOT SO INTIMATE WITH ARE HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS ALREADY OH WHO CAN EVER BE TIRED OF BATH NOT THOSE WHO BRING SUCH FRESH FEELINGS OF EVERY SORT TO IT AS YOU DO
BEFORE SHE REMEMBERED THAT HER ELDEST BROTHER HAD LATELY FORMED AN INTIMACY WITH A YOUNG MAN OF HIS OWN COLLEGE OF THE NAME OF THORPE
AH SAID THE COUNT
BUT FRANZ DID COME WITH THE FOUR THOUSAND CROWNS SAID CHATEAU RENAUD A MAN WHOSE NAME IS FRANZ D'EPINAY OR ALBERT DE MORCERF HAS NOT MUCH DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING THEM NO HE ARRIVED ACCOMPANIED SIMPLY BY THE GUEST I AM GOING TO PRESENT TO YOU

HOPING TO TAKE HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE NO MONSIEUR RETURNED THE COUNT

PARDIEU EVERY ONE EXISTS DOUBTLESS BUT NOT IN THE SAME WAY EVERY ONE HAS NOT BLACK SLAVES A PRINCELY RETINUE AN ARSENAL OF WEAPONS THAT WOULD DO CREDIT TO AN ARABIAN FORTRESS HORSES THAT COST SIX THOUSAND FRANCS APIECE
WHICH CORRESPONDED TO THE COUNT'S OWN THOUGHT RATHER THAN TO WHAT ALBERT WAS SAYING

EVEN HAD I BEEN ABLE TO OFFER HIM THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND THE GARTER WELL SINCE WE ARE NOT TO SIT DOWN TO TABLE SAID DEBRAY TAKE A GLASS OF SHERRY AND TELL US ALL ABOUT IT YOU ALL KNOW THAT I HAD THE FANCY OF GOING TO AFRICA
A LEVANTINE MALTESE INDIAN CHINESE YOUR FAMILY NAME IS MONTE CRISTO
HAD PENETRATED AT ONCE ALL THAT WAS PENETRABLE IN MONTE CRISTO ALBERT HAS NOT DECEIVED US FOR THE COUNT IS A MOST SINGULAR BEING WHAT SAY YOU MORREL MA FOI
AS THAT OF THE PIAZZA DI SPAGNI I OUGHT TO HAVE CONSULTED YOU ON THE POINT
WHICH REDUCED ITS VALUE BUT RENDERED IT MORE COMMODIOUS FOR THE PURPOSE I INTENDED EVERY ONE LOOKED AT MONTE CRISTO WITH ASTONISHMENT
THAN FROM THE SIGHT OF THE EXECUTIONER AND THE CULPRIT
AND ALBERT HIMSELF COULD NOT WHOLLY REFRAIN FROM MANIFESTING SUDDEN EMOTION HE HAD NOT HEARD A CARRIAGE STOP IN THE STREET OR STEPS IN THE ANTE CHAMBER
GIVES A CLEW TO THE LABYRINTH MY DEAR ALBERT SAID DEBRAY
WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE CEMENTED OUR FRIENDSHIP OR WHETHER HE DID NOT RECOLLECT ME HE SOUGHT TO TAKE ME BUT ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS I WHO CAPTURED HIM AND A DOZEN OF HIS BAND
THE TWO YOUNG MEN LOOKED AT MORCERF AS IF TO SAY ARE YOU MAD OR ARE YOU LAUGHING AT US
AND WHO DEIGNED TO LEAVE OFF READING TO INFORM ME THAT UNLESS THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE SIX O'CLOCK
THE COUNT WILL FIND THERE A CHARMING HOTEL WITH A COURT AND GARDEN BAH
GENTLEMEN SAID ALBERT GERMAIN INFORMS ME THAT BREAKFAST IS READY MY DEAR COUNT ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU THE WAY THEY PASSED SILENTLY INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND EVERY ONE TOOK HIS PLACE GENTLEMEN SAID THE COUNT SEATING HIMSELF PERMIT ME TO MAKE A CONFESSION
TOOK ALBERT'S HAND MY DEAR ALBERT SAID HE
THEY HAD LONG SINCE PASSED TO DESSERT AND CIGARS MY DEAR ALBERT SAID DEBRAY RISING IT IS HALF PAST TWO YOUR GUEST IS CHARMING BUT YOU LEAVE THE BEST COMPANY TO GO INTO THE WORST SOMETIMES
WHAT DID THESE TWO SOVEREIGNS GIVE YOU IN EXCHANGE FOR THESE MAGNIFICENT PRESENTS ASKED DEBRAY THE SULTAN THE LIBERTY OF A WOMAN REPLIED THE COUNT THE POPE THE LIFE OF A MAN SO THAT ONCE IN MY LIFE
THE COUNT WAS IT MAY BE REMEMBERED A MOST TEMPERATE GUEST ALBERT REMARKED THIS EXPRESSING HIS FEARS LEST
EMMANUEL HERBAUT MONTE CRISTO SMILED IMPERCEPTIBLY I LIVE THERE DURING MY LEAVE OF ABSENCE CONTINUED MAXIMILIAN AND I SHALL BE TOGETHER WITH MY BROTHER IN LAW EMMANUEL AT THE DISPOSITION OF THE COUNT WHENEVER HE THINKS FIT TO HONOR US
WHAT MATTER SAID MONTE CRISTO IF HE HAS RENDERED THE STATE SERVICES WHICH MERIT THIS DISTINCTION
I EAT EVERYWHERE AND OF EVERYTHING ONLY I EAT BUT LITTLE AND TO DAY THAT YOU REPROACH ME WITH MY WANT OF APPETITE IS MY DAY OF APPETITE
WHICH WAS IN GENERAL SO CLEAR LUSTROUS AND LIMPID WHEN HE PLEASED
BUT I KNOW NOT COUNT HOW YOU CONTRIVED TO INSPIRE SO MUCH RESPECT IN THE BANDITS OF ROME WHO ORDINARILY HAVE SO LITTLE RESPECT FOR ANYTHING
OUR HIMALAYA IS MOUNT VALERIEN OUR GREAT DESERT IS THE PLAIN OF GRENELLE WHERE THEY ARE NOW BORING AN ARTESIAN WELL TO WATER THE CARAVANS WE HAVE PLENTY OF THIEVES THOUGH NOT SO MANY AS IS SAID
OH NO SAID MORREL MY SISTER IS FIVE AND TWENTY MY BROTHER IN LAW IS THIRTY THEY ARE GAY YOUNG AND HAPPY BESIDES THE COUNT WILL BE IN HIS OWN HOUSE AND ONLY SEE THEM WHEN HE THINKS FIT TO DO SO THANKS MONSIEUR SAID MONTE CRISTO
YOU CAN PRESENT YOURSELF EVERYWHERE AND BE WELL RECEIVED
IF THE STRANGER EXPECTED TO PRODUCE AN EFFECT ON MORREL HE WAS NOT MISTAKEN MAXIMILIAN STARTED AS IF HE HAD BEEN ELECTRIFIED THOMSON AND FRENCH SAID HE
THE COUNT APPEARED DRESSED WITH THE GREATEST SIMPLICITY BUT THE MOST FASTIDIOUS DANDY
AND GREEK MISTRESSES HAVE YOU SEEN THE GREEK MISTRESS
HE WAS THEN AT ROME BUT SINCE THAT TIME WHO KNOWS WHERE HE MAY HAVE GONE AND YOU THINK HIM CAPABLE OF BEING EXACT DEMANDED DEBRAY I THINK HIM CAPABLE OF EVERYTHING WELL
FOR EXCEPT MYSELF THESE ROOMS WOULD NOT HOLD A SHADOW MORE
YES SAID MONTE CRISTO BUT UNFORTUNATELY A RECIPE EXCELLENT FOR A MAN LIKE MYSELF WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS APPLIED TO AN ARMY WHICH MIGHT NOT AWAKE WHEN IT WAS NEEDED MAY WE INQUIRE
SAID ALBERT NEVER REPLIED THE COUNT WHO WAS BY THIS TIME PERFECTLY MASTER OF HIMSELF AGAIN WELL
AND THE TERROR OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT BUT OF WHOM IN SPITE OF HIS NATIONAL CELEBRITY
ARE YOU COMING MORREL DIRECTLY
I HAD THREE SIMILAR ONES RETURNED MONTE CRISTO I GAVE ONE TO THE SULTAN WHO MOUNTED IT IN HIS SABRE ANOTHER TO OUR HOLY FATHER THE POPE WHO HAD IT SET IN HIS TIARA
AND FORMED INTO PILLS TEN MINUTES AFTER ONE IS TAKEN THE EFFECT IS PRODUCED ASK BARON FRANZ D'EPINAY I THINK HE TASTED THEM ONE DAY
AND PRAY THAT IF YOU SHOULD EVER BE IN A SIMILAR PREDICAMENT HE MAY DO AS MUCH FOR YOU AS HE DID FOR ME
OBSERVED THE YOUNG ARISTOCRAT IT WAS ONLY TO FIGHT AS AN AMATEUR
BESIDES WHY SHOULD HE TELL A FALSEHOOD WE MUST CONTENT OURSELVES THEN
ALTHOUGH IN REALITY A LIBERAL
BUT AT HIS BUTTON HOLE AH INTERRUPTED MORCERF LAUGHING
HE IS RICH THEN I BELIEVE SO BUT THAT OUGHT TO BE VISIBLE
YOU MAY DEPEND UPON ME TO FIND YOU A FITTING DWELLING HERE
NO THE SACRIFICE RETURNED CHATEAU RENAUD
I AM A STRANGER AND A STRANGER TO SUCH A DEGREE
THAT YOU PLAYED A SUFFICIENTLY IMPORTANT PART TO KNOW AS WELL AS MYSELF WHAT HAPPENED WELL YOU PROMISE ME IF I TELL ALL I KNOW TO RELATE IN YOUR TURN ALL THAT I DO NOT KNOW
THEN CONTINUED CHATEAU RENAUD
A STAB WITH A KNIFE FOR INSTANCE
I SEE THEY KEPT THEIR PROMISE NO MONSIEUR RETURNED MONTE CRISTO UPON THE SIMPLE CONDITION THAT THEY SHOULD RESPECT MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS
THANKS MONSIEUR RETURNED MONTE CRISTO
BUT I NEVER SEEK TO PROTECT A SOCIETY WHICH DOES NOT PROTECT ME
I WAS RETREATING ON FOOT FOR MY HORSE WAS DEAD SIX ARABS CAME UP FULL GALLOP TO CUT OFF MY HEAD I SHOT TWO WITH MY DOUBLE BARRELLED GUN AND TWO MORE WITH MY PISTOLS BUT I WAS THEN DISARMED AND TWO WERE STILL LEFT ONE SEIZED ME BY THE HAIR
MY DEAR VICOMTE RETURNED MONTE CRISTO I DO NOT SEE IN ALL I HAVE DONE
POOR BRUTE ACCUSTOMED TO BE COVERED UP AND TO HAVE A STOVE IN THE STABLE
BESIDES YOU HAVE NO NEED OF ANY ONE TO INTRODUCE YOU
THIS IS A MAGNIFICENT EMERALD AND THE LARGEST I HAVE EVER SEEN SAID CHATEAU RENAUD
WHAT CRIED ALL THE GUESTS
I THINK I CAN ASSIST YOUR RESEARCHES SAID MAXIMILIAN MONTE CRISTO IS A LITTLE ISLAND I HAVE OFTEN HEARD SPOKEN OF BY THE OLD SAILORS MY FATHER EMPLOYED A GRAIN OF SAND IN THE CENTRE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AN ATOM IN THE INFINITE PRECISELY CRIED ALBERT WELL
HE VIGOROUSLY EMBRACED THE PILLOW ON THE OTHER SIDE AND BURIED HIS FACE IN IT BUT ALL AT ONCE HE JUMPED UP
BUT AFTER ALL WHILE SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE I KEPT MYSELF IN HAND AND THE WORST OF IT ALL IS THAT SHE'S ALREADY IT SEEMS AS IF ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT SO
WHICH WERE HELD ALSO BY MANY OF HIS CIRCLE IT AROSE NOT FROM HIS CONSIDERING LIBERALISM MORE RATIONAL BUT FROM ITS BEING IN CLOSER ACCORDANCE WITH HIS MANNER OF LIFE THE LIBERAL PARTY SAID THAT IN RUSSIA EVERYTHING IS WRONG
AND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH COULD NOT GET THROUGH EVEN A SHORT SERVICE WITHOUT HIS LEGS ACHING FROM STANDING UP AND COULD NEVER MAKE OUT WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF ALL THE TERRIBLE AND HIGH FLOWN LANGUAGE ABOUT ANOTHER WORLD WHEN LIFE MIGHT BE SO VERY AMUSING IN THIS WORLD AND WITH ALL THIS
WIPED HIS FACE SQUARED HIS CHEST AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM IT WAS FRIDAY AND IN THE DINING ROOM THE GERMAN WATCHMAKER WAS WINDING UP THE CLOCK STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH REMEMBERED HIS JOKE ABOUT THIS PUNCTUAL BALD WATCHMAKER
AND HER FACE SUDDENLY SOFTENED SHE SEEMED TO BE PULLING HERSELF TOGETHER FOR A FEW SECONDS AS THOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE WAS DOING AND GETTING UP RAPIDLY SHE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR WELL SHE LOVES MY CHILD HE THOUGHT
HE READ THE LETTERS ONE WAS VERY UNPLEASANT FROM A MERCHANT WHO WAS BUYING A FOREST ON HIS WIFE'S PROPERTY TO SELL THIS FOREST WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL BUT AT PRESENT UNTIL HE WAS RECONCILED WITH HIS WIFE THE SUBJECT COULD NOT BE DISCUSSED
AND SHE WENT OUT SLAMMING THE DOOR STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SIGHED WIPED HIS FACE AND WITH A SUBDUED TREAD WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM MATVEY SAYS SHE WILL COME ROUND BUT HOW I DON'T SEE THE LEAST CHANCE OF IT AH OH HOW HORRIBLE IT IS
THAT'S AS IT HAPPENS BUT HERE'S FOR THE HOUSEKEEPING HE SAID TAKING TEN ROUBLES FROM HIS POCKETBOOK THAT'LL BE ENOUGH ENOUGH OR NOT ENOUGH WE MUST MAKE IT DO SAID MATVEY SLAMMING THE CARRIAGE DOOR AND STEPPING BACK ONTO THE STEPS
DARYA ALEXANDROVNA MEANWHILE HAVING PACIFIED THE CHILD AND KNOWING FROM THE SOUND OF THE CARRIAGE THAT HE HAD GONE OFF WENT BACK AGAIN TO HER BEDROOM IT WAS HER SOLITARY REFUGE FROM THE HOUSEHOLD CARES WHICH
TO SORT OUT THE CHILDREN'S THINGS AND HER OWN SO AS TO TAKE THEM TO HER MOTHER'S AND AGAIN SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO DO THIS BUT NOW AGAIN AS EACH TIME BEFORE SHE KEPT SAYING TO HERSELF THAT THINGS CANNOT GO ON LIKE THIS
WHY DO YOU TELL ME THAT DON'T YOU KNOW MATVEY PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS JACKET POCKETS THRUST OUT ONE LEG AND GAZED SILENTLY GOOD HUMOREDLY WITH A FAINT SMILE AT HIS MASTER I TOLD THEM TO COME ON SUNDAY AND TILL THEN NOT TO TROUBLE YOU OR THEMSELVES FOR NOTHING HE SAID
AS IT WAS EVEN IN THE COURSE OF THESE THREE DAYS THE YOUNGEST WAS UNWELL FROM BEING GIVEN UNWHOLESOME SOUP AND THE OTHERS HAD ALMOST GONE WITHOUT THEIR DINNER THE DAY BEFORE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GO AWAY BUT CHEATING HERSELF SHE WENT ON ALL THE SAME SORTING OUT HER THINGS
TURNING OUT HIS FEET THAT CARRIED HIS FULL FRAME SO EASILY HE PULLED UP THE BLIND AND RANG THE BELL LOUDLY IT WAS AT ONCE ANSWERED BY THE APPEARANCE OF AN OLD FRIEND
AND LET HER GO THE CARRIAGE IS READY SAID MATVEY BUT THERE'S SOME ONE TO SEE YOU WITH A PETITION BEEN HERE LONG ASKED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HALF AN HOUR HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU TO TELL ME AT ONCE
AND FOR THAT REASON I WOULD DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD TO SAVE THEM BUT I DON'T MYSELF KNOW HOW TO SAVE THEM BY TAKING THEM AWAY FROM THEIR FATHER OR BY LEAVING THEM WITH A VICIOUS FATHER YES A VICIOUS FATHER TELL ME AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED
WITH PAIN AND WRATH SHE UTTERED THE WORD SO TERRIBLE TO HERSELF STRANGER HE LOOKED AT HER AND THE FURY EXPRESSED IN HER FACE ALARMED AND AMAZED HIM
AND THERE WERE SOME SORT OF LITTLE DECANTERS ON THE TABLE AND THEY WERE WOMEN TOO HE REMEMBERED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH'S EYES TWINKLED GAILY AND HE PONDERED WITH A SMILE YES IT WAS NICE VERY NICE
WHEN HE WAS DRESSED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SPRINKLED SOME SCENT ON HIMSELF PULLED DOWN HIS SHIRT CUFFS DISTRIBUTED INTO HIS POCKETS HIS CIGARETTES POCKETBOOK MATCHES AND WATCH WITH ITS DOUBLE CHAIN AND SEALS AND SHAKING OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF
AND HE LIKED HIS NEWSPAPER AS HE DID HIS CIGAR AFTER DINNER FOR THE SLIGHT FOG IT DIFFUSED IN HIS BRAIN HE READ THE LEADING ARTICLE IN WHICH IT WAS MAINTAINED THAT IT WAS QUITE SENSELESS IN OUR DAY TO RAISE AN OUTCRY THAT RADICALISM WAS THREATENING TO SWALLOW UP ALL CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS
THERE WAS NO SOLUTION BUT THAT UNIVERSAL SOLUTION WHICH LIFE GIVES TO ALL QUESTIONS EVEN THE MOST COMPLEX AND INSOLUBLE
GETTING MORE AND MORE HEATED YOUR TEARS MEAN NOTHING
STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HAD NOT CHOSEN HIS POLITICAL OPINIONS OR HIS VIEWS THESE POLITICAL OPINIONS AND VIEWS HAD COME TO HIM OF THEMSELVES JUST AS HE DID NOT CHOOSE THE SHAPES OF HIS HAT AND COAT BUT SIMPLY TOOK THOSE THAT WERE BEING WORN AND FOR HIM
AS HE REMEMBERED THE ACUTELY PAINFUL SENSATIONS CAUSED HIM BY THIS QUARREL MOST UNPLEASANT OF ALL WAS THE FIRST MINUTE WHEN ON COMING HAPPY AND GOOD HUMORED FROM THE THEATER WITH A HUGE PEAR IN HIS HAND FOR HIS WIFE HE HAD NOT FOUND HIS WIFE IN THE DRAWING ROOM
AND SAW HER AT LAST IN HER BEDROOM WITH THE UNLUCKY LETTER THAT REVEALED EVERYTHING IN HER HAND SHE HIS DOLLY FOREVER FUSSING AND WORRYING OVER HOUSEHOLD DETAILS AND LIMITED IN HER IDEAS AS HE CONSIDERED
THE JOYOUS SMILE WAS EVOKED BY A GOOD DIGESTION BUT THIS JOYOUS SMILE AT ONCE RECALLED EVERYTHING TO HIM AND HE GREW THOUGHTFUL TWO CHILDISH VOICES STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH RECOGNIZED THE VOICES OF GRISHA HIS YOUNGEST BOY AND TANYA HIS ELDEST GIRL
AND DROPPED SOME INNUENDOES REFLECTING ON THE MINISTRY WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC QUICKWITTEDNESS HE CAUGHT THE DRIFT OF EACH INNUENDO DIVINED WHENCE IT CAME AT WHOM AND ON WHAT GROUND IT WAS AIMED AND THAT AFFORDED HIM AS IT ALWAYS DID A CERTAIN SATISFACTION
FEELING HIMSELF CLEAN FRAGRANT HEALTHY AND PHYSICALLY AT EASE IN SPITE OF HIS UNHAPPINESS HE WALKED WITH A SLIGHT SWING ON EACH LEG INTO THE DINING ROOM WHERE COFFEE WAS ALREADY WAITING FOR HIM AND BESIDE THE COFFEE LETTERS AND PAPERS FROM THE OFFICE
AND TRYING ASSIDUOUSLY TO GIVE HER FEATURES A SEVERE AND CONTEMPTUOUS EXPRESSION SHE FELT SHE WAS AFRAID OF HIM AND AFRAID OF THE COMING INTERVIEW
AND EVEN WROTE HER IN HIS LARGE SPRAWLING GOOD AND LEGIBLE HAND A CONFIDENT AND FLUENT LITTLE NOTE TO A PERSONAGE WHO MIGHT BE OF USE TO HER HAVING GOT RID OF THE STAFF CAPTAIN'S WIDOW STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH TOOK HIS HAT AND STOPPED TO RECOLLECT WHETHER HE HAD FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
YOU HAVE NEITHER HEART NOR HONORABLE FEELING
A HANDSOME SUSCEPTIBLE MAN OF THIRTY FOUR WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE THE MOTHER OF FIVE LIVING AND TWO DEAD CHILDREN AND ONLY A YEAR YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF
ARRANGE EVERYTHING WITH DARYA IN THE SITTING ROOM FOR ANNA ARKADYEVNA HE SAID TO MATVEY WHEN HE CAME IN YES SIR STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH PUT ON HIS FUR COAT AND WENT OUT ONTO THE STEPS YOU WON'T DINE AT HOME SAID MATVEY SEEING HIM OFF
THAT SHE MUST TAKE SOME STEP TO PUNISH HIM PUT HIM TO SHAME AVENGE ON HIM SOME LITTLE PART AT LEAST OF THE SUFFERING HE HAD CAUSED HER SHE STILL CONTINUED TO TELL HERSELF THAT SHE SHOULD LEAVE HIM BUT SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE
ARE THERE ANY PAPERS FROM THE OFFICE ASKED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH TAKING THE TELEGRAM AND SEATING HIMSELF AT THE LOOKING GLASS ON THE TABLE REPLIED MATVEY GLANCING WITH INQUIRING SYMPATHY AT HIS MASTER AND AFTER A SHORT PAUSE HE ADDED WITH A SLY SMILE
AND BEGAN READING IT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH TOOK IN AND READ A LIBERAL PAPER NOT AN EXTREME ONE BUT ONE ADVOCATING THE VIEWS HELD BY THE MAJORITY AND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT SCIENCE ART AND POLITICS HAD NO SPECIAL INTEREST FOR HIM
BETRAYED BEWILDERMENT AND SUFFERING DOLLY HE SAID IN A SUBDUED AND TIMID VOICE HE BENT HIS HEAD TOWARDS HIS SHOULDER AND TRIED TO LOOK PITIFUL AND HUMBLE BUT FOR ALL THAT HE WAS RADIANT WITH FRESHNESS AND HEALTH
ENJOYING AS SHE ALWAYS DID THE SMELL OF SCENT THAT CAME FROM HIS WHISKERS AT LAST THE LITTLE GIRL KISSED HIS FACE WHICH WAS FLUSHED FROM HIS STOOPING POSTURE AND BEAMING WITH TENDERNESS LOOSED HER HANDS AND WAS ABOUT TO RUN AWAY AGAIN BUT HER FATHER HELD HER BACK
VULGAR IN FLIRTING WITH ONE'S GOVERNESS BUT WHAT A GOVERNESS
AND NOW DON'T I LOVE HIM DON'T I LOVE HIM MORE THAN BEFORE THE MOST HORRIBLE THING IS SHE BEGAN BUT DID NOT FINISH HER THOUGHT
AND NOT ONLY THE HUSBAND AND WIFE THEMSELVES BUT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLD WERE PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF IT EVERY PERSON IN THE HOUSE FELT THAT THERE WAS NO SENSE IN THEIR LIVING TOGETHER
AND OPENED HIS EYES YES YES HOW WAS IT NOW HE THOUGHT GOING OVER HIS DREAM NOW HOW WAS IT TO BE SURE ALABIN WAS GIVING A DINNER AT DARMSTADT NO NOT DARMSTADT BUT SOMETHING AMERICAN YES BUT THEN DARMSTADT WAS IN AMERICA YES
WAS SITTING PERFECTLY STILL WITH THE LETTER IN HER HAND LOOKING AT HIM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF HORROR DESPAIR AND INDIGNATION WHAT'S THIS THIS SHE ASKED POINTING TO THE LETTER AND AT THIS RECOLLECTION STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE
SEEING HER HUSBAND SHE DROPPED HER HANDS INTO THE DRAWER OF THE BUREAU AS THOUGH LOOKING FOR SOMETHING AND ONLY LOOKED ROUND AT HIM WHEN HE HAD COME QUITE UP TO HER BUT HER FACE TO WHICH SHE TRIED TO GIVE A SEVERE AND RESOLUTE EXPRESSION
AS THOUGH THIS SHRIEK WERE CALLED UP BY PHYSICAL PAIN STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH COULD BE CALM WHEN HE THOUGHT OF HIS WIFE HE COULD HOPE THAT SHE WOULD COME ROUND AS MATVEY EXPRESSED IT AND COULD QUIETLY GO ON READING HIS PAPER AND DRINKING HIS COFFEE BUT WHEN HE SAW HER TORTURED SUFFERING FACE
WAS NOT SO MUCH ANNOYED AT THE FACT ITSELF AS AT THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD MET HIS WIFE'S WORDS THERE HAPPENED TO HIM AT THAT INSTANT WHAT DOES HAPPEN TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE UNEXPECTEDLY CAUGHT IN SOMETHING VERY DISGRACEFUL
HIS LIPS SWELLED HIS EYES WERE SWIMMING WITH TEARS DOLLY HE SAID SOBBING NOW FOR MERCY'S SAKE THINK OF THE CHILDREN THEY ARE NOT TO BLAME I AM TO BLAME AND PUNISH ME MAKE ME EXPIATE MY FAULT ANYTHING I CAN DO I AM READY TO DO ANYTHING
THE MOST UNPLEASANT THING OF ALL WAS THAT HIS PECUNIARY INTERESTS SHOULD IN THIS WAY ENTER INTO THE QUESTION OF HIS RECONCILIATION WITH HIS WIFE AND THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE LED ON BY HIS INTERESTS THAT HE MIGHT SEEK A RECONCILIATION WITH HIS WIFE ON ACCOUNT OF THE SALE OF THE FOREST THAT IDEA HURT HIM
AND CERTAINLY STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HAD MANY DEBTS AND WAS DECIDEDLY SHORT OF MONEY THE LIBERAL PARTY SAID THAT MARRIAGE IS AN INSTITUTION QUITE OUT OF DATE AND THAT IT NEEDS RECONSTRUCTION AND FAMILY LIFE CERTAINLY AFFORDED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH LITTLE GRATIFICATION
EXPECTING WHAT HE WOULD SAY AS IT WERE BESEECHING HIM IN SOME WAY OR OTHER TO MAKE HER BELIEVE DIFFERENTLY INSTANT OF PASSION HE SAID AND WOULD HAVE GONE ON BUT AT THAT WORD AS AT A PANG OF PHYSICAL PAIN HER LIPS STIFFENED AGAIN
DARYA ALEXANDROVNA IN A DRESSING JACKET AND WITH HER NOW SCANTY ONCE LUXURIANT AND BEAUTIFUL HAIR FASTENED UP WITH HAIRPINS ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WITH A SUNKEN THIN FACE AND LARGE STARTLED EYES
THAT THE GERMAN WAS WOUND UP FOR A WHOLE LIFETIME HIMSELF TO WIND UP WATCHES AND HE SMILED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS FOND OF A JOKE AND MAYBE SHE WILL COME ROUND THAT'S A GOOD EXPRESSION COME ROUND HE THOUGHT I MUST REPEAT THAT MATVEY HE SHOUTED
AND HOW VULGARLY SHE SHOUTED HE SAID TO HIMSELF REMEMBERING HER SHRIEK AND THE WORDS SCOUNDREL AND MISTRESS AND VERY LIKELY THE MAIDS WERE LISTENING HORRIBLY VULGAR HORRIBLE STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH STOOD A FEW SECONDS ALONE
HOW IS MAMMA HE ASKED PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS DAUGHTER'S SMOOTH SOFT LITTLE NECK GOOD MORNING HE SAID SMILING TO THE BOY WHO HAD COME UP TO GREET HIM HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE LOVED THE BOY LESS AND ALWAYS TRIED TO BE FAIR BUT THE BOY FELT IT
STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH COULD NOT ANSWER AS THE BARBER WAS AT WORK ON HIS UPPER LIP AND HE RAISED ONE FINGER MATVEY NODDED AT THE LOOKING GLASS ALONE IS THE ROOM TO BE GOT READY UPSTAIRS INFORM DARYA ALEXANDROVNA WHERE SHE ORDERS
HAVING FINISHED THE PAPER A SECOND CUP OF COFFEE AND A ROLL AND BUTTER HE GOT UP SHAKING THE CRUMBS OF THE ROLL OFF HIS WAISTCOAT AND SQUARING HIS BROAD CHEST HE SMILED JOYOUSLY NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS ANYTHING PARTICULARLY AGREEABLE IN HIS MIND
LET US SEND FOR MY BROTHER SHE SAID
EH MATVEY HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD IT'S ALL RIGHT SIR SHE WILL COME ROUND SAID MATVEY COME ROUND YES SIR DO YOU THINK SO WHO'S THERE ASKED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HEARING THE RUSTLE OF A WOMAN'S DRESS AT THE DOOR IT'S I
BUT DOLLY FORGIVE ME SHE SAT DOWN HE LISTENED TO HER HARD HEAVY BREATHING
HE HAS OPENED AN ACCOUNT WITH MY HOUSE FOR HIS SON MAY I ASK HOW MUCH HE ALLOWS THE YOUNG MAN FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS PER MONTH SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS PER YEAR
THAT ALL THESE OLD PODESTAS THESE ANCIENT CONDOTTIERI FOR THE CAVALCANTI HAVE COMMANDED ARMIES AND GOVERNED PROVINCES MY OPINION I SAY IS THAT THEY HAVE BURIED THEIR MILLIONS IN CORNERS
BUT THE WOUND REMAINS AND WILL REOPEN AT THE FIRST LOSS NO FOR I AM ONLY EMBARKED IN CERTAINTIES
AND YOU WOULD HAVE FLATTERED HIM FOR CERTAINLY AS YOU SAY HE HAS NO MANNER THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM HE APPEARED TO ME LIKE AN OLD LIEUTENANT WHO HAD GROWN MOULDY UNDER HIS EPAULETS
AND YOU KNOW I AM A SPECULATOR
COME YOU DO NOT FLATTER HIM I SCARCELY KNOW HIM I THINK I HAVE SEEN HIM THREE TIMES IN MY LIFE ALL I KNOW RELATING TO HIM IS THROUGH BUSONI AND HIMSELF
BUT TOUCHING THESE SPANISH AFFAIRS I THINK THAT THE BARONESS DID NOT DREAM THE WHOLE OF THE DON CARLOS MATTER THE PAPERS SAID SOMETHING ABOUT IT DID THEY NOT THEN YOU BELIEVE THE PAPERS I
I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY YOU WILL LOSE BUT NEVERTHELESS MIND YOU HOLD TO THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT WOULD YOU NOT TRUST THE CAVALCANTI I OH I WOULD ADVANCE SIX MILLIONS ON HIS SIGNATURE
SAID DANGLARS LAUGHING IT WOULD DO HER A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD WHY SO
AND BEEN MORE BITTER THAN EVER AGAINST THE MINISTRY RE ENTERED HIS CARRIAGE
I ACKNOWLEDGE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING TO FIND IT OUT IT WOULD BE VERY EASY IF YOU MUCH WISHED IT HOW SO PROBABLY YOU HAVE SOME CORRESPONDENT IN GREECE I SHOULD THINK SO AT YANINA
THE SECRET OF WHICH THEY HAVE TRANSMITTED ONLY TO THEIR ELDEST SONS WHO HAVE DONE THE SAME FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION AND THE PROOF OF THIS IS SEEN IN THEIR YELLOW AND DRY APPEARANCE LIKE THE FLORINS OF THE REPUBLIC WHICH FROM BEING CONSTANTLY GAZED UPON
HAVE BECOME REFLECTED IN THEM CERTAINLY SAID DANGLARS AND THIS IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY THE FACT OF THEIR NOT POSSESSING AN INCH OF LAND VERY LITTLE AT LEAST I KNOW OF NONE WHICH CAVALCANTI POSSESSES
HE WILL PERHAPS GIVE HIM ONE TWO OR THREE MILLIONS FOR EXAMPLE SUPPOSING IT WERE THE DAUGHTER OF A BANKER HE MIGHT TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE HOUSE OF THE FATHER IN LAW OF HIS SON THEN AGAIN IF HE DISLIKED HIS CHOICE
WITH THE AIR OF A MOUNTEBANK SOUNDING HIS OWN PRAISES TO INVOLVE ME THREE GOVERNMENTS MUST CRUMBLE TO DUST WELL SUCH THINGS HAVE BEEN THAT THERE SHOULD BE A FAMINE RECOLLECT THE SEVEN FAT AND THE SEVEN LEAN KINE
HE HAS BEEN TRAVELLING WITH A VERY SEVERE TUTOR AND HAD NEVER BEEN TO PARIS BEFORE AH I BELIEVE NOBLEMEN MARRY AMONGST THEMSELVES DO THEY NOT
EVERYWHERE WELL WRITE TO YOUR CORRESPONDENT IN YANINA AND ASK HIM
WHICH REMINDED MONTE CRISTO OF THE SICKLY MOONS WHICH BAD ARTISTS ARE SO FOND OF DAUBING INTO THEIR PICTURES OF RUINS BUT WHILE WE ARE SPEAKING OF BUSINESS DANGLARS ADDED
THE WHOLE BRINGING IN A REAL OR FICTITIOUS CAPITAL OF ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLIONS I THINK THIS IS ABOUT YOUR POSITION IS IT NOT CONFOUND IT YES REPLIED DANGLARS
THEN YOU DO NOT SPECULATE I HOW COULD I SPECULATE WHEN I ALREADY HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE IN REGULATING MY INCOME I SHOULD BE OBLIGED BESIDES MY STEWARD TO KEEP A CLERK AND A BOY
YOU HAVE JUST LOST NEARLY TWO MILLIONS WHICH MUST OF COURSE IN THE SAME DEGREE DIMINISH YOUR CREDIT AND FICTITIOUS FORTUNE TO FOLLOW OUT MY SIMILE YOUR SKIN HAS BEEN OPENED BY BLEEDING AND THIS IF REPEATED
PRESAGES SOME MISFORTUNE TO THE WORLD
EXCEPTING HIS PALACE IN LUCCA AH HE HAS A PALACE
MAKE NEARLY TWELVE MILLIONS NO YOU HAVE NOT WELL YOU ARE RIGHT FOR IF YOU INDULGED IN SUCH REFLECTIONS YOU WOULD NEVER RISK YOUR PRINCIPAL WHICH IS TO THE SPECULATOR WHAT THE SKIN IS TO CIVILIZED MAN
A NOBILITY WHICH DATES BACK FIVE CENTURIES IS WORTH MORE THAN ONE THAT CAN ONLY RECKON TWENTY YEARS AND FOR THIS VERY REASON SAID DANGLARS WITH A SMILE
GIVE HIM MONEY IF HE IS RECOMMENDED TO YOU AND THE RECOMMENDATION SEEMS GOOD EXCELLENT HE PRESENTED HIMSELF THIS MORNING WITH A BOND OF FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS PAYABLE AT SIGHT ON YOU SIGNED BY BUSONI
NOT DRAWING MORE THAN ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THE WHOLE FORMING A CAPITAL OF ABOUT FIFTY MILLIONS FINALLY I CALL THOSE THIRD RATE FORTUNES WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF A FLUCTUATING CAPITAL
SAID THE COUNT YOU MUST ALLOW THAT HE HAS A FINE NAME
WHILE THE BANKER WAS WAITING IN THE ANTEROOM THE DOOR OPENED AND A MAN DRESSED AS AN ABBE AND DOUBTLESS MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE HOUSE THAN HE WAS CAME IN AND INSTEAD OF WAITING MERELY BOWED PASSED ON TO THE FARTHER APARTMENTS
YOU HAVE NOTHING BUT YOUR REAL PRINCIPAL OF ABOUT FIVE OR SIX MILLIONS AT THE MOST FOR THIRD RATE FORTUNES ARE NEVER MORE THAN A FOURTH OF WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE
YOU DO NOT KNOW THESE ULTRAMONTANE MILLIONAIRES THEY ARE REGULAR MISERS AND BY WHOM WERE THEY RECOMMENDED TO YOU OH BY THE HOUSE OF FENZI ONE OF THE BEST IN FLORENCE
THAT DEPENDS UPON CIRCUMSTANCES
DO YOU THINK SO I AM SURE OF IT AND YOU HAVE HEARD HIS FORTUNE MENTIONED NOTHING ELSE WAS TALKED OF ONLY SOME SAID HE WAS WORTH MILLIONS AND OTHERS THAT HE DID NOT POSSESS A FARTHING
IMAGINE A MAN WHO HAS TRANSACTED BUSINESS WITH ME FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG TO THE AMOUNT OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND OR NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS DURING THE YEAR NEVER A MISTAKE OR DELAY
THIS WITH MY SPANISH AFFAIRS MADE A PRETTY END TO THE MONTH THEN YOU REALLY LOST BY THAT AFFAIR IN SPAIN YES ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS OUT OF MY CASH BOX NOTHING MORE
SHE DREAMED DON CARLOS HAD RETURNED TO SPAIN SHE BELIEVES IN DREAMS IT IS MAGNETISM SHE SAYS AND WHEN SHE DREAMS A THING IT IS SURE TO HAPPEN SHE ASSURES ME ON THIS CONVICTION I ALLOW HER TO SPECULATE
CHAPTER SIXTY SIX MATRIMONIAL PROJECTS THE DAY FOLLOWING THIS SCENE
I WILL WRITE TO DAY DO SO I WILL AND IF YOU SHOULD HEAR OF ANYTHING VERY SCANDALOUS
THEY LIKE TO UNITE THEIR FORTUNES IT IS USUAL CERTAINLY BUT CAVALCANTI IS AN ORIGINAL WHO DOES NOTHING LIKE OTHER PEOPLE
AND RETURNED BY YOU TO ME WITH YOUR INDORSEMENT OF COURSE I IMMEDIATELY COUNTED HIM OVER THE FORTY BANK NOTES MONTE CRISTO NODDED HIS HEAD IN TOKEN OF ASSENT BUT THAT IS NOT ALL CONTINUED DANGLARS
BOTH HAVING BECOME NOBLE BOTH RICH ARE ABOUT EQUAL IN WORTH EXCEPTING THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CERTAIN THINGS MENTIONED OF HIM THAT WERE NEVER SAID OF ME
DO YOU WANT MONEY DO YOU WISH ME TO LEND YOU SOME
NOT AT ALL ON THE CONTRARY BE SEATED BUT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU YOU LOOK CAREWORN REALLY YOU ALARM ME
WAS BROUGHT BY TELEGRAPH SO THAT SAID MONTE CRISTO YOU HAVE LOST NEARLY ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THIS MONTH NOT NEARLY INDEED THAT IS EXACTLY MY LOSS
HE APPEARED TOLERABLE I WAS UNEASY ABOUT HIM WHY BECAUSE YOU MET HIM AT MY HOUSE JUST AFTER HIS INTRODUCTION INTO THE WORLD AS THEY TOLD ME
BUT MADAME DE MORCERF AND ALBERT YOU DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT IT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD MATCH
I HOLD BILLS OF EXCHANGE SIGNED BY HIM TO THE VALUE OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS PAYABLE AT HIS CORRESPONDENT'S IN PARIS AT THE END OF THIS MONTH TO DAY IS THE THIRTIETH I PRESENT THEM BUT MY CORRESPONDENT HAS DISAPPEARED
BUT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVE NOT HEARD OF THIS
AND WHAT IS YOUR OPINION I OUGHT NOT TO INFLUENCE YOU BECAUSE IT IS ONLY MY OWN PERSONAL IMPRESSION WELL AND IT IS THAT
YOU ARE A MAN OF THE WORLD ARE YOU NOT I THINK SO AND YOU UNDERSTAND HERALDRY A LITTLE WELL LOOK AT MY COAT OF ARMS IT IS WORTH MORE THAN MORCERF'S
I HAVE HEARD THAT NAME IN GREECE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AFFAIRS OF ALI PASHA EXACTLY SO
AH WELL HE WOULD CARE VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT I THINK BUT HE IS BETROTHED TO YOUR DAUGHTER I BELIEVE WELL
EXCLAIMED DANGLARS CALLING TO HIS ASSISTANCE ALL HIS PHILOSOPHY AND DISSIMULATION I HAVE MADE MONEY AT THE SAME TIME BY SPECULATIONS WHICH HAVE SUCCEEDED I HAVE MADE UP THE LOSS OF BLOOD BY NUTRITION I LOST A BATTLE IN SPAIN
IT IS A HARD BLOW FOR A THIRD RATE FORTUNE
WELL WHEN I WAS A CLERK MORCERF WAS A MERE FISHERMAN AND THEN HE WAS CALLED FERNAND
AND DISAPPEARED A MINUTE AFTER THE DOOR BY WHICH THE PRIEST HAD ENTERED REOPENED AND MONTE CRISTO APPEARED
SO THAT I ACTUALLY AM ONE HE MADE HIMSELF A COUNT SO THAT HE IS NOT ONE AT ALL IMPOSSIBLE
AND I HAVE HEARD NOTHING BUT BAD NEWS AH INDEED SAID MONTE CRISTO HAVE YOU HAD ANOTHER FALL AT THE BOURSE
WELL I WAS A MILLION IN ADVANCE WITH HIM AND NOW MY FINE JACOPO MANFREDI SUSPENDS PAYMENT REALLY IT IS AN UNHEARD OF FATALITY
FORM A TOTAL OF ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLIONS I CALL THOSE SECOND RATE FORTUNES THAT ARE GAINED BY MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES JOINT STOCK COMPANIES VICEROYALTIES AND PRINCIPALITIES
STILL I SHOULD NOT THINK THE MORCERFS WOULD YIELD TO THE CAVALCANTI THE MORCERFS
THE RESULT THEN OF SIX MORE SUCH MONTHS AS THIS WOULD BE TO REDUCE THE THIRD RATE HOUSE TO DESPAIR OH SAID DANGLARS BECOMING VERY PALE
BUT TELL ME WHAT
AND EVEN THEN MY VESSELS WOULD BECOME CARAVANS SO MUCH THE BETTER
BUT REMEMBER THAT THOUGH I PLACE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN BUSONI I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS NEVER MIND ACCEPT MY THANKS FOR THE CLIENT YOU HAVE SENT ME IT IS A FINE NAME TO INSCRIBE ON MY LEDGERS
WE HAVE OUR CLOTHES SOME MORE SPLENDID THAN OTHERS THIS IS OUR CREDIT BUT WHEN A MAN DIES HE HAS ONLY HIS SKIN IN THE SAME WAY ON RETIRING FROM BUSINESS
HE WAS TELLING ME THIS MORNING THAT TIRED OF LETTING HIS PROPERTY LIE DORMANT IN ITALY WHICH IS A DEAD NATION HE WISHED TO FIND A METHOD EITHER IN FRANCE OR ENGLAND OF MULTIPLYING HIS MILLIONS
MONTE CRISTO WAS AT HOME ONLY HE WAS ENGAGED WITH SOME ONE
MONTE CRISTO TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS ILL NATURED REMARK BUT STILL
WHOM YOU PERHAPS SAW PASS BY HAS JUST ARRIVED IN PARIS NOT HAVING SEEN HIM FOR A LONG TIME I COULD NOT MAKE UP MY MIND TO LEAVE HIM SOONER SO I HOPE THIS WILL BE SUFFICIENT REASON FOR MY HAVING MADE YOU WAIT
AND I FELT A KIND OF PANIC ON SEEING THE PALE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON ILLUMINATE THE CHAMBER THE SHUTTERS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND WITH A SENSATION OF HORROR NOT TO BE DESCRIBED
OH HOW UNLIKE IT WAS TO THE BLUE SEASONS OF THE SOUTH COVERED WITH ICE IT WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM LAND BY ITS SUPERIOR WILDNESS AND RUGGEDNESS
SOMETIMES SEIZED WITH SUDDEN AGONY HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS TALE AT OTHERS HIS VOICE BROKEN YET PIERCING UTTERED WITH DIFFICULTY THE WORDS SO REPLETE WITH ANGUISH
ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS
AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORT ME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTS UNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARY OF THE HORIZON
WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
SHE WAS THERE LIFELESS AND INANIMATE THROWN ACROSS THE BED HER HEAD HANGING DOWN AND HER PALE AND DISTORTED FEATURES HALF COVERED BY HER HAIR EVERYWHERE I TURN I SEE THE SAME FIGURE HER BLOODLESS ARMS AND RELAXED FORM
AND THIS PURPOSE QUIETED MY AGONY AND FOR AN INTERVAL RECONCILED ME TO LIFE I NOW RELATED MY HISTORY BRIEFLY BUT WITH FIRMNESS AND PRECISION MARKING THE DATES WITH ACCURACY
MY FATHER EVEN NOW MIGHT BE WRITHING UNDER HIS GRASP AND ERNEST MIGHT BE DEAD AT HIS FEET THIS IDEA MADE ME SHUDDER AND RECALLED ME TO ACTION
BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE
THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITH RAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWN
AND DESIRED AND ARDENTLY PRAYED THAT I MIGHT HAVE HIM WITHIN MY GRASP TO WREAK A GREAT
AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAEMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN
KNOW THAT ONE BY ONE MY FRIENDS WERE SNATCHED AWAY I WAS LEFT DESOLATE MY OWN STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED
NETS WERE CAST BUT IN VAIN AFTER PASSING SEVERAL HOURS WE RETURNED HOPELESS
WHICH THREATENED MY DESTRUCTION BUT AGAIN THE FROST CAME AND MADE THE PATHS OF THE SEA SECURE
GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN
AND JOINED MY SAD TEARS TO THEIRS ALL THIS TIME NO DISTINCT IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND
I WOULD WILLINGLY AFFORD YOU EVERY AID IN YOUR PURSUIT BUT THE CREATURE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK APPEARS TO HAVE POWERS WHICH WOULD PUT ALL MY EXERTIONS TO DEFIANCE
AND AFFECTING EVEN TO AN UNINTERESTED OBSERVER THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED SEEMED TO FLIT AROUND
THE MURDER OF CLERVAL AND LASTLY OF MY WIFE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW NOT THAT MY ONLY REMAINING FRIENDS WERE SAFE FROM THE MALIGNITY OF THE FIEND
MELANCHOLY FOLLOWED BUT BY DEGREES I GAINED A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MY MISERIES AND SITUATION AND WAS THEN RELEASED FROM MY PRISON FOR THEY HAD CALLED ME MAD AND DURING MANY MONTHS AS I UNDERSTOOD A SOLITARY CELL HAD BEEN MY HABITATION
SWEAR TO ME WALTON THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THAT YOU WILL SEEK HIM AND SATISFY MY VENGEANCE IN HIS DEATH AND DO I DARE TO ASK OF YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY PILGRIMAGE TO ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE NO
I TREMBLED WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION AS I SAID THIS THERE WAS A FRENZY IN MY MANNER AND SOMETHING I DOUBT NOT OF THAT HAUGHTY FIERCENESS WHICH THE MARTYRS OF OLD ARE SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED
THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE
MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
WHAT IT COULD BE AND UTTERED A WILD CRY OF ECSTASY WHEN I DISTINGUISHED A SLEDGE AND THE DISTORTED PROPORTIONS OF A WELL KNOWN FORM WITHIN
AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OF MY HIDEOUS NARRATION I ARRIVED AT GENEVA MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNK UNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE
AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WHAT AGONIZING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM
OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE
AFTER HAVING LANDED THEY PROCEEDED TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY PARTIES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AMONG THE WOODS AND VINES I ATTEMPTED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND PROCEEDED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE
AND NO FISH COULD BE PROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS
THROUGH FEAR OF HIS TERRIFIC APPEARANCE HE HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR STORE OF WINTER FOOD AND PLACING IT IN A SLEDGE TO DRAW WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON A NUMEROUS DROVE OF TRAINED DOGS
DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECURED HER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY ONCE AFTER THE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL
WOULD SUDDENLY EXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES WHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPAST WAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT
I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD TRICKLING IN MY VEINS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES OF MY LIMBS THIS STATE LASTED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
FLUNG BY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALAS LIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED
GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
CONCERNING THE FIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAID HAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLS PUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE
BUT THE DEADLY LANGUOR AND COLDNESS OF THE LIMBS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NOW HELD IN MY ARMS HAD CEASED TO BE THE ELIZABETH WHOM I HAD LOVED AND CHERISHED THE MURDEROUS MARK OF THE FIEND'S GRASP WAS ON HER NECK
DURING THE DAY I WAS SUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MY FRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER
ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY
AND I HOPED TO INTERCEPT HIM BEFORE HE SHOULD REACH THE BEACH WITH NEW COURAGE THEREFORE I PRESSED ON AND IN TWO DAYS ARRIVED AT A WRETCHED HAMLET ON THE SEASHORE I INQUIRED OF THE INHABITANTS
TO THE ROOM WHERE LAY THE BODY OF ELIZABETH MY LOVE MY WIFE SO LATELY LIVING SO DEAR SO WORTHY SHE HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THE POSTURE IN WHICH I HAD FIRST BEHELD HER
I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE
THAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THE SHAPES OF OBJECTS
AND IF HE HAS INDEED TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ALPS HE MAY BE HUNTED LIKE THE CHAMOIS AND DESTROYED AS A BEAST OF PREY BUT I PERCEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS YOU DO NOT CREDIT MY NARRATIVE
I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAW THE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN TO YOU FIRST ENTERING ON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN
THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE
SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
A FILM COVERED MY EYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER IN THIS STATE I WAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM
THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVED AND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE I KNELT ON THE GRASS AND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THE SACRED EARTH
MY RAGE AND VENGEANCE RETURNED AND LIKE A MIGHTY TIDE OVERWHELMED EVERY OTHER FEELING AFTER A SLIGHT REPOSE DURING WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD HOVERED ROUND AND INSTIGATED ME TO TOIL AND REVENGE
I WILL EXERT MYSELF AND IF IT IS IN MY POWER TO SEIZE THE MONSTER BE ASSURED THAT HE SHALL SUFFER PUNISHMENT PROPORTIONATE TO HIS CRIMES BUT I FEAR FROM WHAT YOU
WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A SHRILL AND DREADFUL SCREAM IT CAME FROM THE ROOM INTO WHICH ELIZABETH HAD RETIRED AS I HEARD IT THE WHOLE TRUTH RUSHED INTO MY MIND MY ARMS DROPPED THE MOTION OF EVERY MUSCLE AND FIBRE WAS SUSPENDED
I ALWAYS PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HAD PROVIDED ME WITH FIRE AND UTENSILS FOR COOKING MY LIFE AS IT PASSED THUS WAS INDEED HATEFUL TO ME AND IT WAS DURING SLEEP ALONE THAT I COULD TASTE JOY O BLESSED SLEEP
FROM THE EXECUTION OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THIS OCCASION
TWIXT JULY AND SEPTEMBER AND OF MAREMMA AND SARDINIA ALL THE DISEASES IN ONE MOAT WERE GATHERED SUCH WAS IT HERE AND SUCH A STENCH CAME FROM IT AS FROM PUTRESCENT LIMBS IS WONT TO ISSUE
BY REASON OF OUR SPEECH AND MEMORY THAT HAVE SMALL ROOM TO COMPREHEND SO MUCH IF WERE AGAIN ASSEMBLED ALL THE PEOPLE WHICH FORMERLY UPON THE FATEFUL LAND OF PUGLIA
AND NOW DEPARTED FROM US WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE GENTLE POET WHEN YET ANOTHER WHICH BEHIND IT CAME CAUSED US TO TURN OUR EYES UPON ITS TOP BY A CONFUSED SOUND THAT ISSUED FROM IT
WHO ENTWINED EIGHT TIMES HIS TAIL ABOUT HIS STUBBORN BACK AND AFTER HE HAD BITTEN IT IN GREAT RAGE SAID OF THE THIEVISH FIRE A CULPRIT THIS
AND I WHO HAD BEFOREHAND MY REPLY IN READINESS FORTHWITH BEGAN TO SPEAK O SOUL THAT DOWN BELOW THERE ART CONCEALED ROMAGNA THINE IS NOT AND NEVER HAS BEEN WITHOUT WAR IN THE BOSOM OF ITS TYRANTS
BUT FOR THE HIGH PRIEST WHOM MAY ILL BETIDE WHO PUT ME BACK INTO MY FORMER SINS AND HOW AND WHEREFORE I WILL HAVE THEE HEAR WHILE I WAS STILL THE FORM OF BONE AND PULP MY MOTHER GAVE TO ME THE DEEDS I DID WERE NOT THOSE OF A LION BUT A FOX
BUT INASMUCH AS NEVER FROM THIS DEPTH DID ANY ONE RETURN IF I HEAR TRUE WITHOUT THE FEAR OF INFAMY I ANSWER I WAS A MAN OF ARMS THEN CORDELIER BELIEVING THUS BEGIRT TO MAKE AMENDS AND TRULY MY BELIEF HAD BEEN FULFILLED
WHICH NO OTHER SUCCOUR HAD AND THE NAILS DOWNWARD WITH THEM DRAGGED THE SCAB IN FASHION AS A KNIFE THE SCALES OF BREAM OR ANY OTHER FISH THAT HAS THEM LARGEST
BOTH OF THE SHORES I SAW AS FAR AS SPAIN FAR AS MOROCCO AND THE ISLE OF SARDES AND THE OTHERS WHICH THAT SEA BATHES ROUND ABOUT I AND MY COMPANY WERE OLD AND SLOW
AS THE SICILIAN BULL THAT BELLOWED FIRST WITH THE LAMENT OF HIM AND THAT WAS RIGHT WHO WITH HIS FILE HAD MODULATED IT BELLOWED SO WITH THE VOICE OF THE AFFLICTED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS MADE OF BRASS
I HAD WHILE LIVING MUCH OF WHAT I WISHED AND NOW ALAS A DROP OF WATER CRAVE
BUT OPEN WAR I NONE HAVE LEFT THERE NOW RAVENNA STANDS AS IT LONG YEARS HAS STOOD THE EAGLE OF POLENTA THERE IS BROODING SO THAT SHE COVERS CERVIA WITH HER VANS
AND RAVING GOES THUS HARRYING OTHER PEOPLE O SAID I TO HIM SO MAY NOT THE OTHER SET TEETH ON THEE LET IT NOT WEARY THEE TO TELL US WHO IT IS ERE IT DART HENCE
BENEATH THE GREEN PAWS FINDS ITSELF AGAIN VERRUCCHIO'S ANCIENT MASTIFF AND THE NEW
BUT SO MAY IT SURVIVE NEATH MANY SUNS SAY TO ME WHO YE ARE AND OF WHAT PEOPLE LET NOT YOUR FOUL AND LOATHSOME PUNISHMENT MAKE YOU AFRAID TO SHOW YOURSELVES TO ME
BITING IN THE MANNER RAN ALONG THAT A BOAR DOES WHEN FROM THE STY TURNED LOOSE ONE TO CAPOCCHIO CAME AND BY THE NAPE SEIZED WITH ITS TEETH HIS NECK
WE OF THE OARS MADE WINGS FOR OUR MAD FLIGHT EVERMORE GAINING ON THE LARBOARD SIDE ALREADY ALL THE STARS OF THE OTHER POLE THE NIGHT BEHELD AND OURS SO VERY LOW IT DID NOT RISE ABOVE THE OCEAN FLOOR
MY MASTER I REPLIED BY HEARING THEE I AM MORE SURE BUT I SURMISED ALREADY IT MIGHT BE SO AND ALREADY WISHED TO ASK THEE WHO IS WITHIN THAT FIRE WHICH COMES SO CLEFT AT TOP
NOW GO THY WAY NO MORE I URGE THEE BECAUSE I COME PERCHANCE A LITTLE LATE TO STAY AND SPEAK WITH ME LET IT NOT IRK THEE THOU SEEST IT IRKS NOT ME AND I AM BURNING
DIVERS LAMENTINGS PIERCED ME THROUGH AND THROUGH WHICH WITH COMPASSION HAD THEIR ARROWS BARBED WHEREAT MINE EARS I COVERED WITH MY HANDS WHAT PAIN WOULD BE IF FROM THE HOSPITALS OF VALDICHIANA
AND THREATENING WITH HIS FINGER FIERCELY AND HEARD HIM CALLED GERI DEL BELLO SO WHOLLY AT THAT TIME WAST THOU IMPEDED BY HIM WHO FORMERLY HELD ALTAFORTE THOU DIDST NOT LOOK THAT WAY
AND THEREFORE ARE CLEFT THUS A DEVIL IS BEHIND HERE WHO DOTH CLEAVE US THUS CRUELLY
SO MAY THY NAILS SUFFICE THEE TO ALL ETERNITY UNTO THIS WORK LATIANS ARE WE WHOM THOU SO WASTED SEEST BOTH OF US HERE ONE WEEPING MADE REPLY BUT WHO ART THOU THAT QUESTIONEST ABOUT US AND SAID THE GUIDE
WE STEP BY STEP WENT ONWARD WITHOUT SPEECH GAZING UPON AND LISTENING TO THE SICK WHO HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LIFT THEIR BODIES I SAW TWO SITTING LEANED AGAINST EACH OTHER AS LEANS IN HEATING PLATTER AGAINST PLATTER
AND VESTED THUS IN GOING I BEMOAN ME
BY REASON THAT OUR WOUNDS ARE CLOSED AGAIN ERE ANY ONE IN FRONT OF HIM REPASS BUT WHO ART THOU THAT MUSEST ON THE CRAG PERCHANCE TO POSTPONE GOING TO THE PAIN THAT IS ADJUDGED UPON THINE ACCUSATIONS
A CASK BY LOSING CENTRE PIECE OR CANT WAS NEVER SHATTERED SO AS I SAW ONE RENT FROM THE CHIN TO WHERE ONE BREAKETH WIND
WHEN WAS THE AIR SO FULL OF PESTILENCE THE ANIMALS DOWN TO THE LITTLE WORM ALL FELL AND AFTERWARDS THE ANCIENT PEOPLE ACCORDING AS THE POETS HAVE AFFIRMED WERE FROM THE SEED OF ANTS RESTORED AGAIN
AS HE WHO GOETH YONDER UNDERTOOK THAT HE MIGHT GAIN THE LADY OF THE HERD TO COUNTERFEIT IN HIMSELF BUOSO DONATI MAKING A WILL AND GIVING IT DUE FORM AND AFTER THE TWO MANIACS HAD PASSED ON WHOM I HELD MINE EYE
HE MUST COME DOWN AMONG MY SERVITORS BECAUSE HE GAVE THE FRAUDULENT ADVICE FROM WHICH TIME FORTH I HAVE BEEN AT HIS HAIR FOR WHO REPENTS NOT CANNOT BE ABSOLVED NOR CAN ONE BOTH REPENT AND WILL AT ONCE
AND HE TO ME THAT IS THE ANCIENT GHOST OF THE NEFARIOUS MYRRHA WHO BECAME BEYOND ALL RIGHTFUL LOVE HER FATHER'S LOVER SHE CAME TO SIN WITH HIM AFTER THIS MANNER BY COUNTERFEITING OF ANOTHER'S FORM
AND BY THE HAIR IT HELD THE HEAD DISSEVERED HUNG FROM THE HAND IN FASHION OF A LANTERN AND THAT UPON US GAZED AND SAID O ME IT OF ITSELF MADE TO ITSELF A LAMP
THE OTHER UPWARD TURNS O YE WHO WITHOUT ANY TORMENT ARE AND WHY I KNOW NOT IN THE WORLD OF WOE HE SAID TO US BEHOLD AND BE ATTENTIVE UNTO THE MISERY OF MASTER ADAM
STILL IT APPEARED WITH AGONY TRANSFIXED THUS BY NOT HAVING ANY WAY OR ISSUE AT FIRST FROM OUT THE FIRE TO ITS OWN LANGUAGE CONVERTED WERE THE MELANCHOLY WORDS BUT AFTERWARDS
WHENCE HE ACCUMULATING WOE ON WOE DEPARTED LIKE A PERSON SAD AND CRAZED BUT I REMAINED TO LOOK UPON THE CROWD AND SAW A THING WHICH I SHOULD BE AFRAID WITHOUT SOME FURTHER PROOF EVEN TO RECOUNT
TO CURE HIM OF THE FEVER OF HIS PRIDE COUNSEL HE ASKED OF ME AND I WAS SILENT BECAUSE HIS WORDS APPEARED INEBRIATE AND THEN HE SAID BE NOT THY HEART AFRAID HENCEFORTH I THEE ABSOLVE
LIVES BETWEEN TYRANNY AND A FREE STATE NOW I ENTREAT THEE TELL US WHO THOU ART BE NOT MORE STUBBORN THAN THE REST HAVE BEEN
HAVE GIVEN ME GOOD I MAY MYSELF NOT GRUDGE IT AS MANY AS THE HIND WHO ON THE HILL RESTS AT THE TIME WHEN HE WHO LIGHTS THE WORLD HIS COUNTENANCE KEEPS LEAST CONCEALED FROM US WHILE AS THE FLY GIVES PLACE UNTO THE GNAT
WHEN IT WAS COME CLOSE TO THE BRIDGE'S FOOT IT LIFTED HIGH ITS ARM WITH ALL THE HEAD TO BRING MORE CLOSELY UNTO US ITS WORDS WHICH WERE BEHOLD NOW THE SORE PENALTY
WHERE THE MINISTRESS OF THE HIGH LORD JUSTICE INFALLIBLE PUNISHES FORGERS WHICH SHE HERE RECORDS I DO NOT THINK A SADDER SIGHT TO SEE WAS IN AEGINA THE WHOLE PEOPLE SICK
IF THOU BUT LATELY INTO THIS BLIND WORLD HAST FALLEN DOWN FROM THAT SWEET LATIAN LAND WHEREFROM I BRING THE WHOLE OF MY TRANSGRESSION SAY IF THE ROMAGNUOLS HAVE PEACE OR WAR
WOULD THAT IT WERE SEEING IT NEEDS MUST BE FOR TWILL AGGRIEVE ME MORE THE MORE I AGE WE WENT OUR WAY AND UP ALONG THE STAIRS THE BOURNS HAD MADE US TO DESCEND BEFORE
AND SAID O THOU WHOM GUILT DOTH NOT CONDEMN AND WHOM I ONCE SAW UP IN LATIAN LAND UNLESS TOO GREAT SIMILITUDE DECEIVE ME
FOR I WAS FROM THE MOUNTAINS THERE BETWEEN URBINO AND THE YOKE WHENCE TIBER BURSTS I STILL WAS DOWNWARD BENT AND LISTENING WHEN MY CONDUCTOR TOUCHED ME ON THE SIDE SAYING SPEAK THOU
AND BEHIND HIM I WENT ALREADY MAKING MY REPLY AND SUPERADDING IN THAT CAVERN WHERE I HELD MINE EYES WITH SUCH ATTENTION FIXED I THINK A SPIRIT OF MY BLOOD LAMENTS THE SIN WHICH DOWN BELOW THERE COSTS SO MUCH THEN SAID THE MASTER
WHEN LIFELESS SHE BEHELD POLYXENA AND OF HER POLYDORUS ON THE SHORE OF OCEAN WAS THE DOLOROUS ONE AWARE OUT OF HER SENSES LIKE A DOG SHE BARKED SO MUCH THE ANGUISH HAD HER MIND DISTORTED
BUT FOR PURSUIT OF VIRTUE AND OF KNOWLEDGE SO EAGER DID I RENDER MY COMPANIONS WITH THIS BRIEF EXHORTATION FOR THE VOYAGE THAT THEN I HARDLY COULD HAVE HELD THEM BACK AND HAVING TURNED OUR STERN UNTO THE MORNING
THAT SO DISPROPORTIONS THE LIMBS WITH HUMOURS WHICH IT ILL CONCOCTS THAT THE FACE CORRESPONDS NOT TO THE BELLY COMPELLED HIM SO TO HOLD HIS LIPS APART AS DOES THE HECTIC WHO BECAUSE OF THIRST ONE TOW'RDS THE CHIN
IF I WERE ONLY STILL SO LIGHT THAT IN A HUNDRED YEARS I COULD ADVANCE ONE INCH I HAD ALREADY STARTED ON THE WAY SEEKING HIM OUT AMONG THIS SQUALID FOLK ALTHOUGH THE CIRCUIT BE ELEVEN MILES AND BE NOT LESS THAN HALF A MILE ACROSS
AND PENITENT AND CONFESSING I SURRENDERED AH WOE IS ME AND IT WOULD HAVE BESTEAD ME
HIS SON BUT UNTO THE LAST BOLGIA OF THE TEN FOR ALCHEMY WHICH IN THE WORLD I PRACTISED
WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED WAY UP THROUGH THE POINT GIVING IT THAT VIBRATION THE TONGUE HAD GIVEN THEM IN THEIR PASSAGE OUT WE HEARD IT SAID O THOU AT WHOM I AIM MY VOICE AND WHO BUT NOW WAST SPEAKING LOMBARD SAYING
O BROTHERS WHO AMID A HUNDRED THOUSAND PERILS I SAID HAVE COME UNTO THE WEST TO THIS SO INCONSIDERABLE VIGIL WHICH IS REMAINING OF YOUR SENSES
TO BE EXPERIENCED OF THE WORLD AND OF THE VICE AND VIRTUE OF MANKIND BUT I PUT FORTH ON THE HIGH OPEN SEA WITH ONE SOLE SHIP AND THAT SMALL COMPANY BY WHICH I NEVER HAD DESERTED BEEN
NOT HAVING POWER TO SPEAK FOR TO EXCUSE MYSELF I WISHED AND STILL EXCUSED MYSELF AND DID NOT THINK I DID IT LESS SHAME DOTH WASH AWAY A GREATER FAULT THE MASTER SAID THAN THIS OF THINE HAS BEEN
EVER BEFORE ME STAND AND NOT IN VAIN FOR FAR MORE DOTH THEIR IMAGE DRY ME UP THAN THE DISEASE WHICH STRIPS MY FACE OF FLESH THE RIGID JUSTICE THAT CHASTISES ME DRAWETH OCCASION FROM THE PLACE IN WHICH I SINNED
WHEN NOW THE FLAME HAD COME UNTO THAT POINT WHERE TO MY LEADER IT SEEMED TIME AND PLACE AFTER THIS FASHION DID I HEAR HIM SPEAK O YE WHO ARE TWOFOLD WITHIN ONE FIRE IF I DESERVED OF YOU WHILE I WAS LIVING
HIS HEART WAS VISIBLE AND THE DISMAL SACK THAT MAKETH EXCREMENT OF WHAT IS EATEN WHILE I WAS ALL ABSORBED IN SEEING HIM HE LOOKED AT ME AND OPENED WITH HIS HANDS HIS BOSOM SAYING
AND THEY WERE TWO IN ONE AND ONE IN TWO
FIVE TIMES REKINDLED AND AS MANY QUENCHED HAD BEEN THE SPLENDOUR UNDERNEATH THE MOON SINCE WE HAD ENTERED INTO THE DEEP PASS WHEN THERE APPEARED TO US A MOUNTAIN DIM FROM DISTANCE
WHO FROM ABOVE DESCENDS BECAUSE IN DRAWING NEAR TO ITS DESIRE OUR INTELLECT INGULPHS ITSELF SO FAR THAT AFTER IT THE MEMORY CANNOT GO TRULY
THAT FORCE WITH WILL COMMINGLES AND THEY CAUSE THAT THE OFFENCES CANNOT BE EXCUSED WILL ABSOLUTE CONSENTETH NOT TO EVIL BUT IN SO FAR CONSENTETH AS IT FEARS IF IT REFRAIN
AS ONE WHOM TOO GREAT EAGERNESS BEWILDERS O WELL CREATED SPIRIT WHO IN THE RAYS OF LIFE ETERNAL DOST THE SWEETNESS TASTE WHICH BEING UNTASTED NE'ER IS COMPREHENDED
YE WHO IN THIS PLACE ARE HAPPY ARE YOU DESIROUS OF A HIGHER PLACE TO SEE MORE OR TO MAKE YOURSELVES MORE FRIENDS FIRST WITH THOSE OTHER SHADES SHE SMILED A LITTLE
IT SEEMED TO ME A CLOUD ENCOMPASSED US LUMINOUS DENSE CONSOLIDATE AND BRIGHT AS ADAMANT ON WHICH THE SUN IS STRIKING
SINCE FROM ABOVE THEY TAKE AND ACT BENEATH OBSERVE ME WELL HOW THROUGH THIS PLACE I COME UNTO THE TRUTH THOU WISHEST THAT HEREAFTER THOU MAYST ALONE KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE FORD
WHICH DOTH TRANSFORM YOU FROM OUR FIRST CONCEPTIONS THEREFORE I WAS NOT SWIFT IN MY REMEMBRANCE BUT WHAT THOU TELLEST ME NOW AIDS ME SO THAT THE REFIGURING IS EASIER TO ME BUT TELL ME
AND ALL THAT NATURE MAKES THEN IT WAS CLEAR TO ME HOW EVERYWHERE IN HEAVEN IS PARADISE ALTHOUGH THE GRACE OF GOOD SUPREME THERE RAIN NOT IN ONE MEASURE BUT AS IT COMES TO PASS
HENCE IF I HELD MY PEACE MYSELF I BLAME NOT
UNLESS COMPLIED WITH AND CONCERNING THIS WITH SUCH PRECISION HAS ABOVE BEEN SPOKEN THEREFORE IT WAS ENJOINED UPON THE HEBREWS TO OFFER STILL THOUGH SOMETIMES WHAT WAS OFFERED MIGHT BE COMMUTED AS THOU OUGHT'ST TO KNOW THE OTHER
TURNED TOWARDS THESE CAUSE THAT BEHIND THY BACK BE PLACED A LIGHT ILLUMING THE THREE MIRRORS AND COMING BACK TO THEE BY ALL REFLECTED THOUGH IN ITS QUANTITY BE NOT SO AMPLE THE IMAGE MOST REMOTE
TOWARDS ME TURNING BLITHE AS BEAUTIFUL SAID UNTO ME FIX GRATEFULLY THY MIND ON GOD WHO UNTO THE FIRST STAR HAS BROUGHT US
WHEREAT SHE PROMPTLY AND WITH LAUGHING EYES OUR CHARITY DOTH NEVER SHUT THE DOORS AGAINST A JUST DESIRE EXCEPT AS ONE WHO WILLS THAT ALL HER COURT BE LIKE HERSELF
WITH THE PRECIOUS BODY THAT IT QUICKENS IN WHICH AS LIFE IN YOU IT IS COMBINED FROM THE GLAD NATURE WHENCE IT IS DERIVED THE MINGLED VIRTUE THROUGH THE BODY SHINES EVEN AS GLADNESS THROUGH THE LIVING PUPIL
O DIVINE SAID I FORTHWITH WHOSE SPEECH INUNDATES ME AND WARMS ME SO IT MORE AND MORE REVIVES ME MY OWN AFFECTION IS NOT SO PROFOUND AS TO SUFFICE IN RENDERING GRACE FOR GRACE
LISTEN AND BELIEVE FOR THE TRUE LIGHT WHICH GIVETH PEACE TO THEM PERMITS THEM NOT TO TURN FROM IT THEIR FEET AND I UNTO THE SHADE THAT SEEMED MOST WISHFUL TO SPEAK DIRECTED ME AND I BEGAN
WHO SAW ME AS I SAW MYSELF TO QUIET IN ME MY PERTURBED MIND OPENED HER MOUTH ERE I DID MINE TO ASK AND SHE BEGAN THOU MAKEST THYSELF SO DULL
TO LEARN FROM HER WHAT WAS THE WEB WHEREIN SHE DID NOT PLY THE SHUTTLE TO THE END A PERFECT LIFE AND MERIT HIGH IN HEAVEN A LADY O'ER US SAID SHE BY WHOSE RULE DOWN IN YOUR WORLD THEY VEST AND VEIL THEMSELVES
BUT BY THAT ONE WHICH CIRCLES FOUR UNITETH WITH THREE CROSSES WITH BETTER COURSE AND WITH A BETTER STAR CONJOINED IT ISSUES AND THE MUNDANE WAX TEMPERS AND STAMPS MORE AFTER ITS OWN FASHION
DOUBT AT THE FOOT OF TRUTH AND THIS IS NATURE WHICH TO THE TOP FROM HEIGHT TO HEIGHT IMPELS US THIS DOTH INVITE ME
THAT A PEARL ON FOREHEAD WHITE COMES NOT LESS SPEEDILY UNTO OUR EYES SUCH SAW I MANY FACES PROMPT TO SPEAK SO THAT I RAN IN ERROR OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH KINDLED LOVE TWIXT MAN AND FOUNTAIN
EITHER THROUGH AND THROUGH THIS PLANET THUS ATTENUATE WERE OF MATTER OR ELSE AS IN A BODY IS APPORTIONED THE FAT AND LEAN SO IN LIKE MANNER THIS WOULD IN ITS VOLUME INTERCHANGE THE LEAVES
INTO ITSELF DID THE ETERNAL PEARL RECEIVE US EVEN AS WATER DOTH RECEIVE A RAY OF LIGHT REMAINING STILL UNBROKEN IF I WAS BODY
SUCH WAS THE FLOWING OF THE HOLY RIVER THAT ISSUED FROM THE FOUNT WHENCE SPRINGS ALL TRUTH THIS PUT TO REST MY WISHES ONE AND ALL O LOVE OF THE FIRST LOVER
WITH RELUCTANCE THAT HAS BEEN DONE IT WAS NOT RIGHT TO DO E'EN AS ALCMAEON
MY SIGHT THAT FOLLOWED HER
GRATEFUL TWILL BE TO ME IF THOU CONTENT ME BOTH WITH THY NAME
MY LADY THERE SO JOYFUL I BEHELD AS INTO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THAT HEAVEN SHE ENTERED MORE LUMINOUS THEREAT THE PLANET GREW AND IF THE STAR ITSELF WAS CHANGED AND SMILED
IF WITH ANOTHER SERVICE FOR BROKEN VOW CAN SUCH RETURN BE MADE AS TO SECURE THE SOUL FROM FURTHER CLAIM THIS CANTO THUS DID BEATRICE BEGIN AND AS A MAN WHO BREAKS NOT OFF HIS SPEECH
AND UNITES THE EARTH NOR ONLY THE CREATED THINGS THAT ARE WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE THIS BOW SHOOTS FORTH BUT THOSE THAT HAVE BOTH INTELLECT AND LOVE THE PROVIDENCE THAT REGULATES ALL THIS
PARADISO CANTO THREE THAT SUN WHICH ERST WITH LOVE MY BOSOM WARMED OF BEAUTEOUS TRUTH HAD UNTO ME DISCOVERED
BY PROVING AND REPROVING THE SWEET ASPECT AND THAT I MIGHT CONFESS MYSELF CONVINCED AND CONFIDENT SO FAR AS WAS BEFITTING I LIFTED MORE ERECT MY HEAD TO SPEAK BUT THERE APPEARED A VISION
FORASMUCH AS FOLLOWING THE SENSES THOU SEEST THAT THE REASON HAS SHORT WINGS BUT TELL ME WHAT THOU THINK'ST OF IT THYSELF AND I
FULL OF BEATITUDE THE SHADE WAS SEEN BY THE EFFULGENCE CLEAR THAT ISSUED FROM IT THINK READER IF WHAT HERE IS JUST BEGINNING NO FARTHER SHOULD PROCEED
NOR OF EXISTENCE MORE OR FEWER YEARS BUT ALL MAKE BEAUTIFUL THE PRIMAL CIRCLE AND HAVE SWEET LIFE IN DIFFERENT DEGREES BY FEELING MORE OR LESS THE ETERNAL BREATH THEY SHOWED THEMSELVES HERE
HE OF THE SERAPHIM MOST ABSORBED IN GOD MOSES AND SAMUEL AND WHICHEVER JOHN THOU MAYST SELECT I SAY AND EVEN MARY HAVE NOT IN ANY OTHER HEAVEN THEIR SEATS THAN HAVE THOSE SPIRITS THAT JUST APPEARED TO THEE
BROUGHT FORTH THE THIRD AND LATEST PUISSANCE THUS UNTO ME SHE SPAKE AND THEN BEGAN AVE MARIA SINGING AND IN SINGING VANISHED AS THROUGH DEEP WATER SOMETHING HEAVY
THERE SHALT THOU SEE HOW IT PERFORCE IS EQUALLY RESPLENDENT NOW
THE OTHER SPHERES BY VARIOUS DIFFERENCES ALL THE DISTINCTIONS WHICH THEY HAVE WITHIN THEM DISPOSE UNTO THEIR ENDS AND THEIR EFFECTS THUS DO THESE ORGANS OF THE WORLD PROCEED AS THOU PERCEIVEST NOW FROM GRADE TO GRADE
BEATRICE DID AS DANIEL HAD DONE RELIEVING NEBUCHADNEZZAR FROM THE WRATH WHICH RENDERED HIM UNJUSTLY MERCILESS AND SAID WELL SEE I HOW ATTRACTETH THEE ONE AND THE OTHER WISH
IF THIS WERE CAUSED BY RARE AND DENSE ALONE ONE ONLY VIRTUE WOULD THERE BE IN ALL OR MORE OR LESS DIFFUSED OR EQUALLY VIRTUES DIVERSE
ALMOST AS YE THE HEAVENS BEHOLD
OF THE HEART'S VEIL SHE NEVER WAS DIVESTED OF GREAT COSTANZA THIS IS THE EFFULGENCE
SO LIKEWISE THIS INTELLIGENCE DIFFUSES ITS VIRTUE MULTIPLIED AMONG THE STARS ITSELF REVOLVING ON ITS UNITY VIRTUE DIVERSE DOTH A DIVERSE ALLOYAGE MAKE
TASTING OF THE HERB THAT MADE HIM PEER OF THE OTHER GODS BENEATH THE SEA TO REPRESENT TRANSHUMANISE IN WORDS IMPOSSIBLE WERE THE EXAMPLE THEN
SINCE ON THE TRUTH IT TRUSTS NOT YET ITS FOOT BUT TURNS THEE AS TIS WONT ON EMPTINESS TRUE SUBSTANCES ARE THESE WHICH THOU BEHOLDEST HERE RELEGATE FOR BREAKING OF SOME VOW THEREFORE SPEAK WITH THEM
AS GIVING THE BELOVED LAUREL ASKS ONE SUMMIT OF PARNASSUS HITHERTO HAS BEEN ENOUGH FOR ME BUT NOW WITH BOTH I NEEDS MUST ENTER THE ARENA LEFT ENTER INTO MY BOSOM THOU
HER EYES DIRECTED TOW'RDS ME WITH THAT LOOK A MOTHER CASTS ON A DELIRIOUS CHILD AND SHE BEGAN ALL THINGS WHATE'ER THEY BE HAVE ORDER AMONG THEMSELVES AND THIS IS FORM
AND IT CAN ATTAIN IT IF NOT THEN EACH DESIRE WOULD FRUSTRATE BE
AND AS FOOLISH THOU THE GREAT LEADER OF THE GREEKS WILT FIND WHENCE WEPT IPHIGENIA HER FAIR FACE AND MADE FOR HER BOTH WISE AND SIMPLE WEEP
SINCE ONLY THROUGH THE SENSE IT APPREHENDETH
THIS OTHER SPLENDOUR WHICH TO THEE REVEALS ITSELF ON MY RIGHT SIDE AND IS ENKINDLED WITH ALL THE ILLUMINATION OF OUR SPHERE WHAT OF MYSELF I SAY APPLIES TO HER
FROM THIS PROCEEDS WHATE'ER FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT APPEARETH DIFFERENT NOT FROM DENSE AND RARE THIS IS THE FORMAL PRINCIPLE THAT PRODUCES ACCORDING TO ITS GOODNESS DARK AND BRIGHT
SUFFICE HIM FOR WHOM GRACE THE EXPERIENCE RESERVES IF I WAS MERELY WHAT OF ME THOU NEWLY CREATEDST LOVE WHO GOVERNEST THE HEAVEN THOU KNOWEST WHO DIDST LIFT ME WITH THY LIGHT
ON THIS ACCOUNT
NOT BECAUSE ALLOTTED THIS SPHERE HAS BEEN TO THEM BUT TO GIVE SIGN OF THE CELESTIAL WHICH IS LEAST EXALTED
IS FOLLOWED BY GREAT FLAME PERCHANCE WITH BETTER VOICES AFTER ME SHALL PRAYER BE MADE THAT CYRRHA MAY RESPOND TO MORTAL MEN BY PASSAGES DIVERSE UPRISES THE WORLD'S LAMP
AND PLEDGED ME TO THE PATHWAY OF HER SECT THEN MEN ACCUSTOMED UNTO EVIL MORE THAN UNTO GOOD FROM THE SWEET CLOISTER TORE ME GOD KNOWS WHAT AFTERWARD MY LIFE BECAME
PERHAPS HIS BOW DOTH HIT UPON SOME TRUTH
FOR TRIUMPH OR OF CAESAR OR OF POET THE FAULT AND SHAME OF HUMAN INCLINATIONS THAT THE PENEIAN FOLIAGE SHOULD BRING FORTH JOY TO THE JOYOUS DELPHIC DEITY
WHERE'ER THE KEY OF SENSE DOTH NOT UNLOCK
IF ONE FOOD SATES AND FOR ANOTHER STILL REMAINS THE LONGING WE ASK FOR THIS AND THAT DECLINE WITH THANKS E'EN THUS DID I WITH GESTURE AND WITH WORD
THAT MAKES THE UNIVERSE RESEMBLE GOD HERE DO THE HIGHER CREATURES SEE THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE ETERNAL POWER WHICH IS THE END
NOR CAN SO GREAT A SPLENDOUR WEARY US FOR STRONG WILL BE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY TO EVERYTHING WHICH HATH THE POWER TO PLEASE US SO SUDDEN AND ALERT APPEARED TO ME BOTH ONE AND THE OTHER CHOIR TO SAY AMEN THAT WELL THEY SHOWED DESIRE FOR THEIR DEAD BODIES
O THOU OUR POOR NOBILITY OF BLOOD IF THOU DOST MAKE THE PEOPLE GLORY IN THEE DOWN HERE WHERE OUR AFFECTION LANGUISHES A MARVELLOUS THING IT NE'ER WILL BE TO ME FOR THERE WHERE APPETITE IS NOT PERVERTED
THE STOCK FROM WHICH WERE THE CALFUCCI BORN WAS GREAT ALREADY AND ALREADY CHOSEN TO CURULE CHAIRS THE SIZII AND ARRIGUCCI O HOW BEHELD I THOSE WHO ARE UNDONE BY THEIR OWN PRIDE AND HOW THE BALLS OF GOLD FLORENCE ENFLOWERED IN ALL THEIR MIGHTY DEEDS
AFTER ITS KIND BEARS WORSE AND BETTER FRUIT AND YE ARE BORN WITH CHARACTERS DIVERSE IF IN PERFECTION TEMPERED WERE THE WAX AND WERE THE HEAVEN IN ITS SUPREMEST VIRTUE THE BRILLIANCE OF THE SEAL WOULD ALL APPEAR BUT NATURE GIVES IT EVERMORE DEFICIENT
IS SITUATE THE FORTUNATE CALAHORRA UNDER PROTECTION OF THE MIGHTY SHIELD IN WHICH THE LION SUBJECT IS AND SOVEREIGN THEREIN WAS BORN THE AMOROUS PARAMOUR OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE ATHLETE CONSECRATE KIND TO HIS OWN AND CRUEL TO HIS FOES
THE BUONDELMONTI EVER THE INTERMINGLING OF THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF MALADY IN CITIES AS IN THE BODY FOOD IT SURFEITS ON AND A BLIND BULL MORE HEADLONG PLUNGES DOWN THAN A BLIND LAMB AND VERY OFTEN CUTS BETTER AND MORE A SINGLE SWORD THAN FIVE
IN THE LIKE MANNER FORTUNE DOES WITH FLORENCE THEREFORE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A MARVELLOUS THING WHAT I SHALL SAY OF THE GREAT FLORENTINES OF WHOM THE FAME IS HIDDEN IN THE PAST I SAW THE UGHI
A WILL BENIGN IN WHICH REVEALS ITSELF EVER THE LOVE THAT RIGHTEOUSLY INSPIRES AS IN THE INIQUITOUS CUPIDITY SILENCE IMPOSED UPON THAT DULCET LYRE AND QUIETED THE CONSECRATED CHORDS
BUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHENCE THEY THITHER CAME SILENCE IS MORE CONSIDERATE THAN SPEECH ALL THOSE WHO AT THAT TIME WERE THERE BETWEEN MARS AND THE BAPTIST FIT FOR BEARING ARMS WERE A FIFTH PART OF THOSE WHO NOW ARE LIVING BUT THE COMMUNITY THAT NOW IS MIXED
AND IF IT DO REMAIN SAY IN WHAT MANNER AFTER YE ARE AGAIN MADE VISIBLE IT CAN BE THAT IT INJURE NOT YOUR SIGHT AS BY A GREATER GLADNESS URGED AND DRAWN THEY WHO ARE DANCING IN A RING SOMETIMES UPLIFT THEIR VOICES AND THEIR MOTIONS QUICKEN
WITH ALL THESE FAMILIES AND OTHERS WITH THEM FLORENCE BEHELD I IN SO GREAT REPOSE THAT NO OCCASION HAD SHE WHENCE TO WEEP
IN THE LIKE MANNER WORKING AS THE ARTIST WHO HAS THE SKILL OF ART AND HAND THAT TREMBLES IF THEN THE FERVENT LOVE THE VISION CLEAR OF PRIMAL VIRTUE DO DISPOSE AND SEAL PERFECTION ABSOLUTE IS THERE ACQUIRED
THAT HEAVEN'S RIGHT HAND DOTH TIGHTEN AND RELAX HOW UNTO JUST ENTREATIES SHALL BE DEAF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH TO GIVE ME DESIRE OF PRAYING THEM WITH ONE ACCORD GREW SILENT TIS WELL THAT WITHOUT END HE SHOULD LAMENT
BY GRACE OF HER WHO TO THIS LOFTY FLIGHT WITH PLUMAGE CLOTHED THEE THOU THINKEST THAT TO ME THY THOUGHT DOTH PASS FROM HIM WHO IS THE FIRST AS FROM THE UNIT IF THAT BE KNOWN RAY OUT THE FIVE AND SIX AND THEREFORE
AND FROM THE MIRROR HIS DAME DEPART WITHOUT A PAINTED FACE AND HIM OF NERLI SAW AND HIM OF VECCHIO CONTENTED WITH THEIR SIMPLE SUITS OF BUFF AND WITH THE SPINDLE AND THE FLAX THEIR DAMES O FORTUNATE WOMEN
WHO HAST UNTO MY SEED SO COURTEOUS BEEN AND IT CONTINUED HUNGER LONG AND GRATEFUL DRAWN FROM THE READING OF THE MIGHTY VOLUME WHEREIN IS NEVER CHANGED THE WHITE NOR DARK THOU HAST APPEASED MY SON WITHIN THIS LIGHT IN WHICH I SPEAK TO THEE
THEN BROKE THE SILENCE OF THOSE SAINTS CONCORDANT THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE ADMIRABLE LIFE OF GOD'S OWN MENDICANT WAS TOLD TO ME AND SAID
SOME WHO TURN FLORENTINES AND TRADE AND DISCOUNT WOULD HAVE GONE BACK AGAIN TO SIMIFONTE THERE WHERE THEIR GRANDSIRES WENT ABOUT AS BEGGARS AT MONTEMURLO STILL WOULD BE THE COUNTS THE CERCHI IN THE PARISH OF ACONE PERHAPS IN VALDIGRIEVE
DOMINIC WAS HE CALLED AND HIM I SPEAK OF EVEN AS OF THE HUSBANDMAN WHOM CHRIST ELECTED TO HIS GARDEN TO ASSIST HIM ENVOY AND SERVANT SOOTH HE SEEMED OF CHRIST FOR THE FIRST LOVE MADE MANIFEST IN HIM WAS THE FIRST COUNSEL THAT WAS GIVEN BY CHRIST
NOR SOLE FOR THEM PERHAPS BUT FOR THE MOTHERS THE FATHERS AND THE REST WHO HAD BEEN DEAR OR EVER THEY BECAME ETERNAL FLAMES AND LO ALL ROUND ABOUT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AROSE A LUSTRE OVER WHAT WAS THERE LIKE AN HORIZON THAT IS CLEARING UP
EVEN IN THEIR FALL ILLUSTRIOUS CITIZENS AND SAW AS MIGHTY AS THEY ANCIENT WERE WITH HIM OF LA SANNELLA HIM OF ARCA AND SOLDANIER ARDINGHI AND BOSTICHI NEAR TO THE GATE THAT IS AT PRESENT LADEN WITH A NEW FELONY OF SO MUCH WEIGHT
FROM WHICH SHE TAKETH STILL HER TIERCE AND NONES ABODE IN QUIET TEMPERATE AND CHASTE NO GOLDEN CHAIN SHE HAD NOR CORONAL NOR LADIES SHOD WITH SANDAL SHOON NOR GIRDLE THAT CAUGHT THE EYE MORE THAN THE PERSON DID
NOW IF NO FARTHER FORTH I SHOULD PROCEED THEN IN WHAT WAY WAS HE WITHOUT A PEER
THAT THOU WILT SATISFY ME WITH THY NAME O LEAF OF MINE IN WHOM I PLEASURE TOOK E'EN WHILE AWAITING I WAS THINE OWN ROOT SUCH A BEGINNING HE IN ANSWER MADE ME THEN SAID TO ME THAT ONE FROM WHOM IS NAMED THY RACE
WITHIN THAT REGION WHERE THE SWEET WEST WIND RISES TO OPEN THE NEW LEAVES WHEREWITH EUROPE IS SEEN TO CLOTHE HERSELF AFRESH NOT FAR OFF FROM THE BEATING OF THE WAVES BEHIND WHICH IN HIS LONG CAREER THE SUN SOMETIMES CONCEALS HIMSELF FROM EVERY MAN
AND ALREADY GALIGAJO HAD HILT AND POMMEL GILDED IN HIS HOUSE MIGHTY ALREADY WAS THE COLUMN VAIR SACCHETTI GIUOCHI FIFANT AND BARUCCI AND GALLI AND THEY WHO FOR THE BUSHEL BLUSH
THE ONE AND TWO AND THREE WHO EVER LIVETH AND REIGNETH EVER IN THREE AND TWO AND ONE NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED AND ALL THINGS CIRCUMSCRIBING THREE SEVERAL TIMES WAS CHANTED BY EACH ONE AMONG THOSE SPIRITS WITH SUCH MELODY THAT FOR ALL MERIT IT WERE JUST REWARD
WHO I AM THOU ASKEST NOT AND WHY I SEEM MORE JOYOUS UNTO THEE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GLADSOME CROWD THOU THINK'ST THE TRUTH BECAUSE THE SMALL AND GREAT OF THIS EXISTENCE LOOK INTO THE MIRROR WHEREIN BEFORE THOU THINK'ST THY THOUGHT THOU SHOWEST
WHEN I NARRATED THAT NO SECOND HAD THE GOOD WHICH IN THE FIFTH LIGHT IS ENCLOSED NOW OPE THINE EYES TO WHAT I ANSWER THEE AND THOU SHALT SEE THY CREED AND MY DISCOURSE FIT IN THE TRUTH AS CENTRE IN A CIRCLE THAT WHICH CAN DIE
WHO FOR THE LOVE OF THING THAT DOTH NOT LAST ETERNALLY DESPOILS HIM OF THAT LOVE AS THROUGH THE PURE AND TRANQUIL EVENING AIR THERE SHOOTS FROM TIME TO TIME A SUDDEN FIRE MOVING THE EYES THAT STEADFAST WERE BEFORE
THE MOMENT WHEN SHE FELT THE FROST OF DEATH AND ONE TO HAVE ITS RAYS WITHIN THE OTHER AND BOTH TO WHIRL THEMSELVES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE SHOULD FORWARD GO THE OTHER BACKWARD
ITS BRIGHTNESS IS PROPORTIONED TO THE ARDOUR THE ARDOUR TO THE VISION AND THE VISION EQUALS WHAT GRACE IT HAS ABOVE ITS WORTH WHEN GLORIOUS AND SANCTIFIED OUR FLESH IS REASSUMED THEN SHALL OUR PERSONS BE MORE PLEASING BY THEIR BEING ALL COMPLETE
OR IF IN SEMICIRCLE CAN BE MADE TRIANGLE SO THAT IT HAVE NO RIGHT ANGLE WHENCE IF THOU NOTEST THIS AND WHAT I SAID A REGAL PRUDENCE IS THAT PEERLESS SEEING IN WHICH THE SHAFT OF MY INTENTION STRIKES AND IF ON ROSE THOU TURNEST THY CLEAR EYES
AND WHEN IT WAS CREATED WAS HIS MIND REPLETE WITH SUCH A LIVING ENERGY THAT IN HIS MOTHER HER IT MADE PROPHETIC AS SOON AS THE ESPOUSALS WERE COMPLETE BETWEEN HIM AND THE FAITH AT HOLY FONT WHERE THEY WITH MUTUAL SAFETY DOWERED EACH OTHER
EVEN AS DISTINCT WITH LESS AND GREATER LIGHTS GLIMMERS BETWEEN THE TWO POLES OF THE WORLD THE GALAXY THAT MAKETH WISE MEN DOUBT THUS CONSTELLATED IN THE DEPTHS OF MARS THOSE RAYS DESCRIBED THE VENERABLE SIGN THAT QUADRANTS JOINING IN A CIRCLE MAKE
THAT SOON IT SHALL BE JETSAM FROM THE BARK THE RAVIGNANI WERE FROM WHOM DESCENDED THE COUNTY GUIDO AND WHOE'ER THE NAME OF THE GREAT BELLINCIONE SINCE HATH TAKEN HE OF LA PRESSA KNEW THE ART OF RULING ALREADY
WHEREIN HER FAMILY LESS PERSEVERES YET ONCE AGAIN MY WORDS BEGINNING MADE WHENCE BEATRICE WHO STOOD SOMEWHAT APART SMILING APPEARED LIKE UNTO HER WHO COUGHED
AND HIM OF SIGNA WHO HAS SHARP EYES FOR TRICKERY ALREADY HAD NOT THE FOLK WHICH MOST OF ALL THE WORLD DEGENERATES BEEN A STEP DAME UNTO CAESAR
SO THAT FIRE SEEMED IT BEHIND ALABASTER THUS PITEOUS DID ANCHISES SHADE REACH FORWARD IF ANY FAITH OUR GREATEST MUSE DESERVE WHEN IN ELYSIUM HE HIS SON PERCEIVED
NOT FOR THE WORLD WHICH PEOPLE TOIL FOR NOW IN FOLLOWING OSTIENSE AND TADDEO BUT THROUGH HIS LONGING AFTER THE TRUE MANNA HE IN SHORT TIME BECAME SO GREAT A TEACHER THAT HE BEGAN TO GO ABOUT THE VINEYARD WHICH FADETH SOON IF FAITHLESS BE THE DRESSER
SO THAT THE SIGHT SEEMS REAL AND UNREAL IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NEW SUBSISTENCES BEGAN THERE TO BE SEEN AND MAKE A CIRCLE OUTSIDE THE OTHER TWO CIRCUMFERENCES O VERY SPARKLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT HOW SUDDEN AND INCANDESCENT IT BECAME UNTO MINE EYES THAT VANQUISHED BORE IT NOT
AND THAT WHICH DIETH NOT ARE NOTHING BUT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE IDEA WHICH BY HIS LOVE OUR LORD BRINGS INTO BEING BECAUSE THAT LIVING LIGHT WHICH FROM ITS FOUNT EFFULGENT FLOWS SO THAT IT DISUNITES NOT FROM HIM NOR FROM THE LOVE IN THEM INTRINED
BUT BEATRICE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING APPEARED TO ME THAT WITH THE OTHER SIGHTS THAT FOLLOWED NOT MY MEMORY I MUST LEAVE HER THEN TO UPLIFT THEMSELVES MINE EYES RESUMED THE POWER AND I BEHELD MYSELF TRANSLATED TO HIGHER SALVATION WITH MY LADY ONLY
KNIGHTHOOD AND PRIVILEGE FROM HIM RECEIVED THOUGH WITH THE POPULACE UNITES HIMSELF TO DAY THE MAN WHO BINDS IT WITH A BORDER ALREADY WERE GUALTEROTTI AND IMPORTUNI AND STILL MORE QUIET WOULD THE BORGO BE IF WITH NEW NEIGHBOURS IT REMAINED UNFED
I AM AS I AM WONT TWILL NOT BE FROM CASAL NOR ACQUASPARTA FROM WHENCE COME SUCH UNTO THE WRITTEN WORD THAT ONE AVOIDS IT AND THE OTHER NARROWS
LET HIM IMAGINE WHO WOULD WELL CONCEIVE WHAT NOW I SAW AND LET HIM WHILE I SPEAK RETAIN THE IMAGE AS A STEADFAST ROCK THE FIFTEEN STARS THAT IN THEIR DIVERS REGIONS THE SKY ENLIVEN WITH A LIGHT SO GREAT
ANOTHER DRAWING TRESSES FROM HER DISTAFF TOLD O'ER AMONG HER FAMILY THE TALES OF TROJANS AND OF FESOLE AND ROME AS GREAT A MARVEL THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD A LAPO SALTERELLO
WHEN JUNO TO HER HANDMAID GIVES COMMAND THE ONE WITHOUT BORN OF THE ONE WITHIN LIKE TO THE SPEAKING OF THAT VAGRANT ONE WHOM LOVE CONSUMED AS DOTH THE SUN THE VAPOURS
AND PETER MANGIADOR AND PETER OF SPAIN WHO DOWN BELOW IN VOLUMES TWELVE IS SHINING NATHAN THE SEER AND METROPOLITAN CHRYSOSTOM
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND THIRTY MORE TO REINFLAME ITSELF BENEATH HIS PAW MY ANCESTORS AND I OUR BIRTHPLACE HAD WHERE FIRST IS FOUND THE LAST WARD OF THE CITY BY HIM WHO RUNNETH IN YOUR ANNUAL GAME SUFFICE IT OF MY ELDERS TO HEAR THIS
AND NOT YET FROM MY BOSOM WAS EXHAUSTED THE ARDOUR OF SACRIFICE BEFORE I KNEW THIS OFFERING WAS ACCEPTED AND AUSPICIOUS FOR WITH SO GREAT A LUSTRE AND SO RED SPLENDOURS APPEARED TO ME IN TWOFOLD RAYS I SAID O HELIOS WHO DOST SO ADORN THEM
OF THE SAME WEIGHT FOR EACH OF YOU BECAME FOR IN THE SUN WHICH LIGHTED YOU AND BURNED WITH HEAT AND RADIANCE THEY SO EQUAL ARE THAT ALL SIMILITUDES ARE INSUFFICIENT BUT AMONG MORTALS WILL AND ARGUMENT FOR REASON THAT TO YOU IS MANIFEST
WHICH THE HEAVEN PRODUCES BY ITS OWN MOTION WITH SEED AND WITHOUT NEITHER THEIR WAX NOR THAT WHICH TEMPERS IT REMAINS IMMUTABLE AND HENCE BENEATH THE IDEAL SIGNET MORE AND LESS SHINES THROUGH THEREFORE IT HAPPENS THAT THE SELFSAME TREE
MANY WOULD BE REJOICING WHO ARE SAD IF GOD HAD THEE SURRENDERED TO THE EMA THE FIRST TIME THAT THOU CAMEST TO THE CITY BUT IT BEHOVED THE MUTILATED STONE WHICH GUARDS THE BRIDGE THAT FLORENCE SHOULD PROVIDE A VICTIM IN HER LATEST HOUR OF PEACE
ITSELF ETERNALLY REMAINING ONE THENCE IT DESCENDS TO THE LAST POTENCIES DOWNWARD FROM ACT TO ACT BECOMING SUCH THAT ONLY BRIEF CONTINGENCIES IT MAKES AND THESE CONTINGENCIES I HOLD TO BE THINGS GENERATED
AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN THE WHOLE BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE RICH IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION THE REMAINDER WAS SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS
IT WAS ONLY IN HIS PRESENCE THAT CATHERINE FELT THE SMALLEST FATIGUE FROM HER JOURNEY AND EVEN THEN EVEN IN MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR RESTRAINT A SENSE OF GENERAL HAPPINESS PREPONDERATED AND SHE COULD THINK OF HER FRIENDS IN BATH WITHOUT ONE WISH OF BEING WITH THEM THE NIGHT WAS STORMY
SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE APPEARANCE OF A HIGH OLD FASHIONED BLACK CABINET WHICH THOUGH IN A SITUATION CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH HAD NEVER CAUGHT HER NOTICE BEFORE HENRY'S WORDS HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE EBONY CABINET WHICH WAS TO ESCAPE HER OBSERVATION AT FIRST
HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY AND WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CATHERINE WITH A DISAPPOINTED ANXIOUS FACE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN INCLINATION UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER
THE GENERAL'S GOOD HUMOUR INCREASED WHY AS HE HAD SUCH ROOMS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE NOT TO MAKE USE OF THEM
BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
HE TRUSTED HOWEVER THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ERE LONG OCCUR OF SELECTING ONE THOUGH NOT FOR HIMSELF CATHERINE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN USED TO MUCH BETTER SIZED APARTMENTS AT MISTER ALLEN'S NO INDEED WAS CATHERINE'S HONEST ASSURANCE MISTER ALLEN'S DINING PARLOUR WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF AS LARGE AND SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO LARGE A ROOM AS THIS IN HER LIFE
THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
THE WALLS SURROUNDING WHICH I BUILT AND STOCKED MYSELF ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY SON IT IS A FAMILY LIVING MISS MORLAND AND THE PROPERTY IN THE PLACE BEING CHIEFLY MY OWN YOU MAY BELIEVE I TAKE CARE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE A BAD ONE
I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS THE NETTING BOX JUST LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE AND SHE WAS READY TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT
ALARMED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY A BOLT FLEW AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SUCCESSFUL BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER
BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY SUCH PURSUIT TO GET ME OUT OF DOORS THE PLEASURE OF WALKING AND BREATHING FRESH AIR IS ENOUGH FOR ME
HER FINGERS GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND A THIRD A FOURTH EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED
SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON WHERE BUSINESS REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY ALL ATTENDED IN THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE ENTERING THE BREAKFAST ROOM CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE
AND SO DESPERATE SHOULD BE THE EXERTION OF HER STRENGTH THAT UNLESS SECURED BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS THE LID IN ONE MOMENT SHOULD BE THROWN BACK WITH THIS SPIRIT SHE SPRANG FORWARD AND HER CONFIDENCE DID NOT DECEIVE HER HER RESOLUTE EFFORT THREW BACK THE LID AND GAVE TO HER ASTONISHED EYES
SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED TO FEEL ALARM FROM WIND BUT NOW EVERY BLAST SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH AWFUL INTELLIGENCE THE MANUSCRIPT SO WONDERFULLY FOUND SO WONDERFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THE MORNING'S PREDICTION HOW WAS IT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT COULD IT CONTAIN
AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO AND THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A FAGGOT HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE SOME OTHER PLACES I DO NOT KNOW THAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
HE SUFFERED THE GIRLS AT LAST TO SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF AN OUTER DOOR AND THEN EXPRESSING HIS WISH TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SOME RECENT ALTERATIONS ABOUT THE TEA HOUSE PROPOSED IT AS NO UNPLEASANT EXTENSION OF THEIR WALK IF MISS MORLAND WERE NOT TIRED
A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PRESENT A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT FRIEND
AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
HER HEART INSTANTANEOUSLY AT EASE ON THIS POINT SHE RESOLVED TO LOSE NO TIME IN PARTICULAR EXAMINATION OF ANYTHING AS SHE GREATLY DREADED DISOBLIGING THE GENERAL BY ANY DELAY
HE PERCEIVED HER INCLINATION AND HAVING AGAIN URGED THE PLEA OF HEALTH IN VAIN WAS TOO POLITE TO MAKE FURTHER OPPOSITION HE EXCUSED HIMSELF HOWEVER FROM ATTENDING THEM THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE NOT TOO CHEERFUL FOR HIM AND HE WOULD MEET THEM BY ANOTHER COURSE HE TURNED AWAY
NEITHER HER FATHER NOR MISTER ALLEN DID SO IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PROVOKING
BY WHAT MEANS COULD IT HAVE BEEN SO LONG CONCEALED AND HOW SINGULARLY STRANGE THAT IT SHOULD FALL TO HER LOT TO DISCOVER IT TILL SHE HAD MADE HERSELF MISTRESS OF ITS CONTENTS HOWEVER SHE COULD HAVE NEITHER REPOSE NOR COMFORT AND WITH THE SUN'S FIRST RAYS SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PERUSE IT
OR IF HE DID NOT HIS FRIENDS AND CHILDREN DID THERE WERE GREAT VEXATIONS HOWEVER ATTENDING SUCH A GARDEN AS HIS
AND MOST HEARTILY DID SHE REJOICE IN THE HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER ENTRANCE WITHIN WALLS SO SOLEMN SHE HAD NOTHING TO DREAD FROM MIDNIGHT ASSASSINS OR DRUNKEN GALLANTS
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A MOMENT'S GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY CATHERINE THAT HER APARTMENT WAS VERY UNLIKE THE ONE WHICH HENRY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ALARM HER BY THE DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS BY NO MEANS UNREASONABLY LARGE AND CONTAINED NEITHER TAPESTRY NOR VELVET
SHE HAD OFTEN READ OF SUCH CHARACTERS CHARACTERS WHICH MISTER ALLEN HAD BEEN USED TO CALL UNNATURAL AND OVERDRAWN BUT HERE WAS PROOF POSITIVE OF THE CONTRARY SHE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WHEN THE END OF THE PATH BROUGHT THEM DIRECTLY UPON THE GENERAL
WAS EVERY MOMENT GROWING GREATER AND SEIZING WITH TREMBLING HANDS THE HASP OF THE LOCK SHE RESOLVED AT ALL HAZARDS TO SATISFY HERSELF AT LEAST AS TO ITS CONTENTS WITH DIFFICULTY FOR SOMETHING SEEMED TO RESIST HER EFFORTS SHE RAISED THE LID A FEW INCHES
HER QUICK EYES DIRECTLY FELL ON A ROLL OF PAPER PUSHED BACK INTO THE FURTHER PART OF THE CAVITY APPARENTLY FOR CONCEALMENT AND HER FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE INDESCRIBABLE HER HEART FLUTTERED HER KNEES TREMBLED AND HER CHEEKS GREW PALE
A GLANCE AT THE OLD CHEST AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THIS EXAMINATION WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE SHE SCORNED THE CAUSELESS FEARS OF AN IDLE FANCY AND BEGAN WITH A MOST HAPPY INDIFFERENCE TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR BED SHE SHOULD TAKE HER TIME SHE SHOULD NOT HURRY HERSELF
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL SIZED ROOM AND FURTHER CONFESSED THAT THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE HE DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE HE SUPPOSED HOWEVER
THE GENERAL LISTENED WITH ASSENTING GRATITUDE AND IT SEEMED AS IF HIS OWN ESTIMATION OF NORTHANGER HAD WAITED UNFIXED TILL THAT HOUR
AS A MEANS OF GETTING YOU OUT OF DOORS AND TEMPTING YOU TO MORE FREQUENT EXERCISE THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE TAKE AND THOUGH THE LOVE OF A HYACINTH MAY BE RATHER DOMESTIC WHO CAN TELL THE SENTIMENT ONCE RAISED BUT YOU MAY IN TIME COME TO LOVE A ROSE
AND IN NOT ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER AND SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN THE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED AND THOUGH SHE HAD
FOR GENERAL TILNEY WAS PACING THE DRAWING ROOM HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND AND HAVING ON THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR ENTERING PULLED THE BELL WITH VIOLENCE ORDERED DINNER TO BE ON TABLE DIRECTLY CATHERINE TREMBLED AT THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE
WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXCITED AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE WAS NOW ABSOLUTE AVERSION YES AVERSION HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM ODIOUS TO HER
AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH AWFUL SENSATIONS THIS STRIKING EXEMPLIFICATION OF WHAT HENRY HAD FORETOLD RESOLVED INSTANTLY TO PERUSE EVERY LINE BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTED TO REST THE DIMNESS OF THE LIGHT HER CANDLE EMITTED MADE HER TURN TO IT WITH ALARM
STRUCK ON HER AFFRIGHTED EAR HUMAN NATURE COULD SUPPORT NO MORE A COLD SWEAT STOOD ON HER FOREHEAD THE MANUSCRIPT FELL FROM HER HAND AND GROPING HER WAY TO THE BED SHE JUMPED HASTILY IN AND SOUGHT SOME SUSPENSION OF AGONY BY CREEPING FAR UNDERNEATH THE CLOTHES
TO SUPPOSE THAT A MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN A ROOM SUCH AS THAT SO MODERN SO HABITABLE
A VIOLENT GUST OF WIND RISING WITH SUDDEN FURY ADDED FRESH HORROR TO THE MOMENT CATHERINE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN THE PAUSE WHICH SUCCEEDED A SOUND LIKE RECEDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLOSING OF A DISTANT DOOR
AND YET UNEQUAL TO AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD
SAID MISS TILNEY AS CATHERINE HASTILY CLOSED IT AND TURNED AWAY TO THE GLASS
BUT IT WAS SO VERY ODD AFTER WHAT HENRY HAD SAID IN SHORT SHE COULD NOT SLEEP TILL SHE HAD EXAMINED IT SO PLACING THE CANDLE WITH GREAT CAUTION ON A CHAIR SHE SEIZED THE KEY WITH A VERY TREMULOUS HAND AND TRIED TO TURN IT BUT IT RESISTED HER UTMOST STRENGTH
AND HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK THOUGH IN THAT HER EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS APPEARED IN VIEW WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM AND IN THE CENTRE
INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW
IF HENRY HAD BEEN WITH THEM INDEED BUT NOW SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHEN SHE SAW IT SUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF AND PUT ON HER BONNET IN PATIENT DISCONTENT SHE WAS STRUCK HOWEVER BEYOND HER EXPECTATION BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE ABBEY
WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF THAT SORT HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT HE DID BELIEVE THEM TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM IF HE HAD A HOBBY HORSE IT WAS THAT HE LOVED A GARDEN THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING HE LOVED GOOD FRUIT
THE WIND ROARED DOWN THE CHIMNEY THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO SPEAK THE AWFULNESS OF HER SITUATION
AND SHE WAS PREPARING TO UNPIN THE LINEN PACKAGE WHICH THE CHAISE SEAT HAD CONVEYED FOR HER IMMEDIATE ACCOMMODATION WHEN HER EYE SUDDENLY FELL ON A LARGE HIGH CHEST STANDING BACK IN A DEEP RECESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE THE SIGHT OF IT MADE HER START
THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
BELIEVE THE LAST LETTER TO BE A T AND YET THAT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE NO COMMON DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT IF NOT ORIGINALLY THEIRS BY WHAT STRANGE EVENTS COULD IT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE TILNEY FAMILY HER FEARFUL CURIOSITY
MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE HE WAS SURE MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE AND IN THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS
TO RETIRE TO BED HOWEVER UNSATISFIED ON SUCH A POINT WOULD BE VAIN SINCE SLEEP MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CABINET SO MYSTERIOUSLY CLOSED IN HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY AGAIN THEREFORE SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO THE KEY
AS HE SOON FORCED HER TO TELL HIM IN WORDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY GARDENS AT ALL EQUAL TO THEM BEFORE
BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER STARTING QUIT HER HOLD AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE THIS ILL TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF USE TO MISS MORLAND AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER
FOR SHE COULD NOW MANAGE THEM WITH PERFECT EASE IN THIS THERE WAS SURELY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND SHE INDULGED IN THE FLATTERING SUGGESTION FOR HALF A MINUTE TILL THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DOOR'S HAVING BEEN AT FIRST UNLOCKED
HIM TRYING TO CURRY FAVOR THAT WAY SO HARD PUSHED AND POOR AND YET HIRING THAT USELESS JUBITER DUNLAP TO PLEASE HIS ORNERY BROTHER WHAT A NAME JUBITER WHERE'D HE GET
MUCH OF THAT THEY'LL GET OUT OF YOU AND HUCK FINN I RECKON THERE'S A NEIGHBOR NAMED BRACE DUNLAP THAT'S BEEN WANTING TO MARRY THEIR BENNY FOR THREE MONTHS AND AT LAST THEY TOLD HIM POINT BLANK AND ONCE FOR ALL HE COULDN'T SO HE HAS SOURED ON THEM
BUT HE SET THERE AND STUDIED AND STUDIED TILL I WAS THAT DISTRESSED I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO THEN HE SAYS VERY CA'M AND I COULD A SHOT HIM FOR IT WELL HE SAYS I'M RIGHT DOWN SORRY AUNT POLLY BUT I RECKON I GOT TO BE EXCUSED
I KNOWED WE COULD GET HIM DRUNK HE WAS ALWAYS READY FOR THAT BUT WHAT'S THE GOOD OF IT YOU MIGHT SEARCH HIM A YEAR AND NEVER FIND WELL RIGHT THERE I CATCHED MY BREATH AND BROKE OFF MY THOUGHT FOR AN IDEA WENT RIPPING THROUGH MY HEAD THAT TORE MY BRAINS TO RAGS
AND SET DOWN ON THE END OF THE SKY LIGHT BOTH OF US KNOWED WHAT THAT MEANT WITHOUT HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO ONE ANOTHER BUD DIXON WOULD WAKE UP AND MISS THE SWAG AND WOULD COME STRAIGHT FOR US FOR HE AIN'T AFEARD OF ANYTHING OR ANYBODY THAT MAN AIN'T HE WOULD COME AND WE WOULD HEAVE HIM OVERBOARD
THE WAY IT COME ABOUT WAS THIS HE GOT TO ASKING US KIND OF INDIFFERENT LIKE ABOUT THE PASSENGERS DOWN ON DECK WE TOLD HIM ABOUT THEM BUT HE WARN'T SATISFIED WE WARN'T PARTICULAR ENOUGH HE TOLD US TO DESCRIBE THEM BETTER TOM DONE IT AT LAST
AND HE AIN'T AS POPULAR NOW AS HE USED TO WAS WELL AIN'T IT STRANGE WHY AUNT POLLY HE WAS ALWAYS SO GOOD AND KIND AND MOONY AND ABSENT MINDED AND CHUCKLE HEADED AND LOVABLE WHY HE WAS JUST AN ANGEL
AT LAST BUD DIXON HE DROPPED OFF AS SOON AS HE WAS SNORING A GOOD REGULAR GAIT THAT WAS LIKELY TO LAST AND HAD HIS CHIN ON HIS BREAST AND LOOKED PERMANENT HAL CLAYTON NODDED TOWARDS THE DI'MONDS AND THEN TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE DOOR AND I UNDERSTOOD
THE TIME HE WAS CHAINED UP FOR A RUNAWAY SLAVE DOWN THERE ON TOM'S UNCLE SILAS'S FARM IN ARKANSAW THE FROST WAS WORKING OUT OF THE GROUND AND OUT OF THE AIR TOO AND IT WAS GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER ONTO BAREFOOT TIME EVERY DAY
OR GET KILLED TRYING IT MADE ME SHIVER BECAUSE I AIN'T AS BRAVE AS SOME PEOPLE BUT IF I SHOWED THE WHITE FEATHER WELL I KNOWED BETTER THAN DO THAT I KIND OF HOPED THE BOAT WOULD LAND SOMERS AND WE COULD SKIP ASHORE AND NOT HAVE TO RUN THE RISK OF THIS ROW
WELL I GOT MY BOOTS ON AND WE WENT DOWN AND SLIPPED IN AND LAID THE PAPER OF SUGAR ON THE BERTH AND SAT DOWN SOFT AND SHEEPISH AND WENT TO LISTENING TO BUD DIXON SNORE HAL CLAYTON DROPPED OFF PRETTY SOON BUT I DIDN'T
BUT JAKE DUNLAP SAID IT WARN'T UNUSUAL IN THE PROFESSION SAID WHEN A PERSON WAS IN THAT LINE OF BUSINESS HE'D GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR HIS OWN INTRUST THERE WARN'T NOBODY ELSE GOING TO DO IT FOR HIM AND THEN HE WENT ON HE SAYS YOU SEE THE TROUBLE WAS
SP'ILING SUCH A NOBLE CHANCE AS THIS AND THROWING IT AWAY BUT HE WARN'T DISTURBED HE MUMBLED BACK HUCK FINN DO YOU WANT ME TO
YOU FELLOWS GOT AWAY WITH THEM AS EASY AS NOTHING I DON'T RECKON THE JULERY PEOPLE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN ROBBED YET
I REACHED AND GOT THE PAPER AND THEN WE STOOD UP AND WAITED PERFECTLY STILL BUD NEVER STIRRED I TURNED THE KEY OF THE OUTSIDE DOOR VERY SOFT AND SLOW THEN TURNED THE KNOB THE SAME WAY AND WE WENT TIPTOEING OUT ONTO THE GUARD
AND IT MUST HAVE SET HIM BACK A GOOD DEAL WHEN HE FOUND HE COULDN'T GET BENNY WHY BENNY'S ONLY HALF AS OLD AS HE IS AND JUST AS SWEET AND LOVELY AS WELL YOU'VE SEEN HER POOR OLD UNCLE SILAS WHY IT'S PITIFUL
THAT'S ONE OF THEM THEY'RE ABOARD SURE I JUST KNOWED IT I SORT OF HOPED I HAD GOT AWAY BUT I NEVER BELIEVED IT GO ON PRESENTLY WHEN TOM WAS DESCRIBING ANOTHER MANGY ROUGH DECK PASSENGER
AND WAS NEARLY THE COLOR OF THE CARPET IT WAS A LITTLE ROUND PLUG ABOUT AS THICK AS THE END OF YOUR LITTLE FINGER AND I SAYS TO MYSELF THERE'S A DI'MOND IN THE NEST YOU'VE COME FROM BEFORE LONG I SPIED OUT THE PLUG'S MATE
THEY DON'T HEAR ABOUT HIM ANY MORE WHAT WAS HIS NAME JAKE
A GOOD BLACK STORMY NIGHT AND I COULD GET ASHORE YOU SEE THEY'VE GOT SPIES ON ME THEY'VE GOT A RIGHT TO COME UP AND BUY DRINKS AT THE BAR YONDER FORRARD AND THEY TAKE THAT CHANCE TO BRIBE SOMEBODY TO KEEP WATCH ON ME PORTER OR BOOTS OR SOMEBODY
IF I WAS TO SLIP ASHORE WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING ME THEY WOULD KNOW IT INSIDE OF AN HOUR SO THEN HE GOT TO WANDERING ALONG AND PRETTY SOON SURE ENOUGH HE WAS TELLING HE WAS POKING ALONG THROUGH HIS UPS AND DOWNS AND
WHY HE'S JUST AS GENTLE AS MUSH WELL SHE'S WORRIED ANYWAY SAYS YOUR UNCLE SILAS IS LIKE A CHANGED MAN ON ACCOUNT OF ALL THIS QUARRELING AND THE NEIGHBORS TALK ABOUT IT AND LAY ALL THE BLAME ON YOUR UNCLE OF COURSE BECAUSE HE'S A PREACHER
AND I'LL GIVE THE BOYS THE SLIP AND WHEN I'M SAFE AWAY I'LL PUT IT ON AND THEN LET THEM FIND ME IF THEY CAN SO I GOT THE FALSE WHISKERS AND THE GOGGLES AND THIS COUNTRIFIED SUIT OF CLOTHES AND FETCHED THEM ALONG BACK IN A HAND BAG
THINK OF THE SMARTNESS AND COOLNESS OF THAT BLATHERSKITE HE PUT UP THAT SCHEME ON US AND REASONED OUT WHAT WE WOULD DO AND WE WENT AHEAD AND DONE IT PERFECTLY EXACT LIKE A COUPLE OF PUDD'NHEADS
WHERE WE'D GO ONE WAS FOR GOING ONE WAY ONE ANOTHER SO WE THROWED UP HEADS OR TAILS AND THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI WON WE DONE UP THE DI'MONDS IN A PAPER AND PUT OUR NAMES ON IT AND PUT IT IN THE KEEP OF THE HOTEL CLERK
AND GIVES HIM HIS OLD CLOTHES TO WEAR AND DESPISES HIM JUBITER IS A TWIN WHAT'S T'OTHER TWIN LIKE JUST EXACTLY LIKE JUBITER SO THEY SAY USED TO WAS ANYWAY BUT HE HAIN'T BEEN SEEN FOR SEVEN YEARS
IT WAS ONLY JUST A SCREWDRIVER JUST A WEE LITTLE BIT OF A SCREWDRIVER WELL I DECLARE
SEE HOW FAR OFF SUMMER IS YES AND IT SETS HIM TO SIGHING AND SADDENING AROUND AND THERE'S SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH HIM
IT TURNED OUT JUST SO IT WARN'T NO TROUBLE TO SEE THAT HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT ALWAYS ALONG AT FIRST HE WOULD SCARE AWAY FROM IT WHEN HE GOT ON THE VERY EDGE OF IT AND GO TO TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
HE'S A WIDOWER THIRTY SIX YEARS OLD WITHOUT ANY CHILDREN AND IS PROUD OF HIS MONEY AND OVERBEARING AND EVERYBODY IS A LITTLE AFRAID OF HIM I JUDGE HE THOUGHT HE COULD
AND WHEN I WAS PASSING A SHOP WHERE THEY SELL ALL SORTS OF THINGS I GOT A GLIMPSE OF ONE OF MY PALS THROUGH THE WINDOW IT WAS BUD DIXON I WAS GLAD YOU BET I SAYS TO MYSELF I'LL SEE WHAT HE BUYS SO I KEPT SHADY AND WATCHED
HE SET THERE LIKE A ROCK AND NEVER SAID A WORD IT MADE ME FIT TO CRY TO SEE HIM ACT SO FOOLISH WITH SUCH A NOBLE CHANCE AS THIS OPENING UP WHY WE MIGHT LOSE IT IF HE DIDN'T SPEAK UP AND SHOW HE WAS THANKFUL AND GRATEFUL
AND HE'S JUBITER YET HE'S TALL AND LAZY AND SLY AND SNEAKY AND RUTHER COWARDLY TOO BUT KIND OF GOOD NATURED AND WEARS LONG BROWN HAIR AND NO BEARD AND HASN'T GOT A CENT AND BRACE BOARDS HIM FOR NOTHING
HE GOT TO ROBBING WHEN HE WAS NINETEEN OR TWENTY AND THEY JAILED HIM BUT HE BROKE JAIL AND GOT AWAY UP NORTH HERE SOMERS THEY USED TO HEAR ABOUT HIM ROBBING AND BURGLARING NOW AND THEN BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE'S DEAD NOW AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
FOR THE PRESENT HIS AUNT POLLY WAS KNOCKED SO STUPID AND SO MAD AT THE COLD IMPUDENCE OF IT THAT SHE COULDN'T SAY A WORD FOR AS MUCH AS A HALF A MINUTE AND THIS GAVE ME A CHANCE TO NUDGE TOM AND WHISPER
AND SETS THERE AND LOOKS AWAY OFF ON THE BIG MISSISSIPPI DOWN THERE A REACHING MILES AND MILES AROUND THE POINTS WHERE THE TIMBER LOOKS SMOKY AND DIM IT'S SO FAR OFF AND STILL AND EVERYTHING'S SO SOLEMN IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY YOU'VE LOVED IS DEAD AND GONE
THEN WE WAITED TEN MORE FOR HER TO GET COOLED DOWN AND SWEET AND GENTLE AGAIN FOR TOM SAID IT TOOK HER TEN MINUTES TO UNRUFFLE IN TIMES WHEN HALF OF HER FEATHERS WAS UP BUT TWENTY WHEN THEY WAS ALL UP AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE TIMES WHEN
I SEEN OUR OTHER PAL LAY IN HIS STOCK OF OLD RUSTY SECOND HANDERS WE GOT THE DI'MONDS AND WENT ABOARD THE BOAT BUT NOW WE WAS UP A STUMP FOR WE COULDN'T GO TO BED WE HAD TO SET UP AND WATCH ONE ANOTHER PITY THAT WAS
AS HE SAID HIS AUNT POLLY WOULDN'T LET HIM QUIT SCHOOL AND GO TRAIPSING OFF SOMERS WASTING TIME SO WE WAS PRETTY BLUE
TOM SAWYER WAS ALWAYS RIGHT THE LEVELEST HEAD I EVER SEE AND ALWAYS AT HIMSELF AND READY FOR ANYTHING YOU MIGHT SPRING ON HIM BY THIS TIME HIS AUNT POLLY WAS ALL STRAIGHT AGAIN AND SHE LET FLY
I WASN'T EVER SO WIDE AWAKE IN MY LIFE I WAS SPYING OUT FROM UNDER THE SHADE OF MY HAT BRIM SEARCHING THE FLOOR FOR LEATHER IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME AND I BEGUN TO THINK MAYBE MY GUESS WAS WRONG BUT AT LAST I STRUCK IT IT LAID OVER BY THE BULKHEAD
FROM THAT TIME OUT WE WAS WITH HIM MOST ALL THE TIME AND ONE OR T'OTHER OF US SLEPT IN HIS UPPER BERTH HE SAID HE HAD BEEN SO LONESOME AND IT WAS SUCH A COMFORT TO HIM TO HAVE COMPANY AND SOMEBODY TO TALK TO IN HIS TROUBLES
YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THAT PUZZLESOME LITTLE SCREWDRIVER YOU BET I DO SAYS TOM ALL EXCITED WELL WHEN I CATCHED THAT GLIMPSE OF THAT BOOT HEEL THE IDEA THAT WENT SMASHING THROUGH MY HEAD WAS I KNOW WHERE HE'S HID THE DI'MONDS
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS CURIOUS IT CLEAN STUMPED ME I SAYS TO MYSELF WHAT CAN HE WANT WITH THAT THING WELL WHEN HE COME OUT I STOOD BACK OUT OF SIGHT AND THEN TRACKED HIM TO A SECOND HAND SLOP SHOP
AND YOU MOST WISH YOU WAS DEAD AND GONE TOO AND DONE WITH IT ALL DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS IT'S SPRING FEVER THAT IS WHAT THE NAME OF IT IS AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT IT YOU WANT OH YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU DO WANT
UNCLE SILAS LAND YOU MUST BE JOKING I DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD ANY TEMPER WORKS HIM UP INTO PERFECT RAGES YOUR AUNT SALLY SAYS SAYS HE ACTS AS IF HE WOULD REALLY HIT THE MAN SOMETIMES AUNT POLLY IT BEATS ANYTHING I EVER HEARD OF
AND THE FIRST NIGHT WE WAS ASHORE WE WOULD GET HIM DRUNK AND SEARCH HIM AND GET THE DI'MONDS AND DO FOR HIM TOO IF IT WARN'T TOO RISKY IF WE GOT THE SWAG WE'D GOT TO DO FOR HIM OR HE WOULD HUNT US DOWN AND DO FOR US SURE BUT I DIDN'T HAVE NO REAL HOPE
AND SEE HIM BUY A RED FLANNEL SHIRT AND SOME OLD RAGGED CLOTHES JUST THE ONES HE'S GOT ON NOW AS YOU'VE DESCRIBED THEN I WENT DOWN TO THE WHARF AND HID MY THINGS ABOARD THE UP RIVER BOAT THAT WE HAD PICKED OUT AND THEN STARTED BACK AND HAD ANOTHER STREAK OF LUCK
THEY WAS ALL UP THEN WE WENT DOWN BEING IN A SWEAT TO KNOW WHAT THE LETTER SAID SHE WAS SETTING THERE IN A BROWN STUDY WITH IT LAYING IN HER LAP WE SET DOWN AND SHE SAYS THEY'RE IN CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE DOWN THERE
AIN'T IT SUSPICIOUS LAND HAL SAYS DO YOU RECKON HE'S PLAYING US OPEN THE PAPER I DONE IT AND BY GRACIOUS THERE WARN'T ANYTHING IN IT BUT A COUPLE OF LITTLE PIECES OF LOAF SUGAR THAT'S THE REASON HE COULD SET THERE AND SNOOZE ALL NIGHT SO COMFORTABLE
YOU COULDN'T DIVIDE UP TWO DI'MONDS AMONGST THREE IF THERE'D BEEN THREE BUT NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT THERE WARN'T THREE I LOAFED ALONG THE BACK STREETS STUDYING AND STUDYING AND I SAYS TO MYSELF I'LL HOG THEM DI'MONDS THE FIRST CHANCE I GET AND I'LL HAVE A DISGUISE ALL READY
WHAT NOTION TOM SAYS TO ROB THE OTHERS WHAT ONE TAKE EVERYTHING AFTER ALL OF YOU HAD HELPED TO GET IT CERT'NLY IT DISGUSTED TOM SAWYER AND HE SAID IT WAS THE ORNERIEST LOW DOWNEST THING HE EVER HEARD OF
THEM WAS THE THINGS THAT WENT BACK TO THE SHOP WHEN WE SAID THE WATER WASN'T QUITE FINE ENOUGH FOR TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TOM SAYS WAS THEY REALLY WORTH ALL THAT MONEY DO YOU RECKON EVERY CENT OF IT AND
I RECKON THEY'VE FORGOT HIS REAL NAME LONG BEFORE THIS HE'S TWENTY SEVEN NOW AND HAS HAD IT EVER SINCE THE FIRST TIME HE EVER WENT IN SWIMMING
PITY TO PUT THAT KIND OF A STRAIN ON US BECAUSE THERE WAS BAD BLOOD BETWEEN US FROM A COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK AND WE WAS ONLY FRIENDS IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS BAD ANYWAY
WHEN TOM WAS DESCRIBING ONE OF THE ROUGHEST AND RAGGEDEST ONES HE GAVE A SHIVER AND A GASP AND SAYS
THE FORMER NOW HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HARRY MAYLIE AND HEARTY SALUTATIONS WERE EXCHANGED BETWEEN THEM THE DOCTOR THEN COMMUNICATED IN REPLY TO MULTIFARIOUS QUESTIONS FROM HIS YOUNG FRIEND A PRECISE ACCOUNT OF HIS PATIENT'S SITUATION
EVEN IF SHE HAD KNOWN HOW TO DO SO IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE THOUGHT OF FOR THE SAME REASON ONCE THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HER OF SEEKING ASSISTANCE FROM HARRY BUT THIS AWAKENED THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR LAST PARTING AND IT SEEMED UNWORTHY OF HER TO CALL HIM BACK WHEN
WITH HER ATTENTION NOT A LITTLE DISTRACTED BY THESE AND A GREAT MANY OTHER INCOHERENT EXCLAMATIONS OF JOY ROSE READ THE ADDRESS WHICH WAS CRAVEN STREET IN THE STRAND SHE VERY SOON DETERMINED UPON TURNING THE DISCOVERY TO ACCOUNT
WHO MAY HE BE THAT LADY'S SON AND THIS YOUNG LADY'S VERY OLD FRIEND SAID THE DOCTOR MOTIONING TOWARDS MISSUS MAYLIE AND CONCLUDING WITH AN EXPRESSIVE GLANCE AT HER NIECE
THE GOOD SOUL LAUGHED AND WEPT UPON HIS NECK BY TURNS LEAVING HER AND OLIVER TO COMPARE NOTES AT LEISURE MISTER BROWNLOW LED THE WAY INTO ANOTHER ROOM AND THERE HEARD FROM ROSE A FULL NARRATION OF HER INTERVIEW WITH NANCY
WERE THE SCOWLING FEATURES OF THE MAN WHO HAD ACCOSTED HIM IN THE INN YARD
AND READILY UNDERTOOK TO HOLD SOLEMN CONFERENCE WITH THE WORTHY DOCTOR HIMSELF TO AFFORD HIM AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXECUTION OF THIS DESIGN IT WAS ARRANGED THAT HE SHOULD CALL AT THE HOTEL AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THAT EVENING AND THAT IN THE MEANTIME
AND IF YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO PRODUCE ANY EVIDENCE WHICH WILL ALTER THE UNFAVOURABLE OPINION I WAS ONCE INDUCED TO ENTERTAIN OF THAT POOR CHILD IN HEAVEN'S NAME PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF IT A BAD ONE I'LL EAT MY HEAD IF HE IS NOT A BAD ONE
UPSET IT WITH A GREAT CRASH AND FALLING BACK IN HIS CHAIR DISCHARGED FROM HIS FEATURES EVERY EXPRESSION BUT ONE OF UNMITIGATED WONDER AND INDULGED IN A PROLONGED AND VACANT STARE THEN AS IF ASHAMED OF HAVING BETRAYED SO MUCH EMOTION
AND AGAIN RECOILING FROM ALL AS EACH SUCCESSIVE CONSIDERATION PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER MIND ROSE PASSED A SLEEPLESS AND ANXIOUS NIGHT AFTER MORE COMMUNING WITH HERSELF NEXT DAY SHE ARRIVED AT THE DESPERATE CONCLUSION OF CONSULTING HARRY
AND HE'D UNCOMMONLY LIKE TO SEE ANY MAN OFFER TO DO IT RESPONDED MISTER GRIMWIG KNOCKING HIS STICK UPON THE FLOOR HAVING GONE THUS FAR THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN SEVERALLY TOOK SNUFF
CONCERNED WITH THE GANG IN ANY OF THEIR ROBBERIES IF HE WERE NOT DISCHARGED IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT HE COULD RECEIVE ANY FURTHER PUNISHMENT THAN BEING COMMITTED TO PRISON AS A ROGUE AND VAGABOND
TO DEPOSIT IN THE LOCAL SAVINGS BANK THE SUM OF FIVE AND TWENTY POUNDS FOR HIS SOLE USE AND BENEFIT AT THIS THE TWO WOMEN SERVANTS LIFTED UP THEIR HANDS AND EYES AND SUPPOSED THAT MISTER GILES PULLING OUT HIS SHIRT FRILL REPLIED NO NO
MISSUS MAYLIE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUSLY INFORMED OF ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED THESE PRELIMINARIES ADJUSTED ROSE AND OLIVER RETURNED HOME ROSE HAD BY NO MEANS OVERRATED THE MEASURE OF THE GOOD DOCTOR'S WRATH NANCY'S HISTORY WAS NO SOONER UNFOLDED TO HIM
SAID MISTER BROWNLOW RINGING THE BELL SEND MISSUS BEDWIN HERE IF YOU PLEASE THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER ANSWERED THE SUMMONS WITH ALL DISPATCH AND DROPPING A CURTSEY AT THE DOOR WAITED FOR ORDERS WHY YOU GET BLINDER EVERY DAY BEDWIN
BUT WHAT IS THIS OF WHOM DO YOU SPEAK I HAVE SEEN THE GENTLEMAN REPLIED OLIVER SCARCELY ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS SO GOOD TO ME MISTER BROWNLOW THAT WE HAVE SO OFTEN TALKED ABOUT WHERE ASKED ROSE
LADEN WITH FLOWERS WHICH HE HAD CULLED WITH PECULIAR CARE FOR THE ADORNMENT OF THE SICK CHAMBER AS HE WALKED BRISKLY ALONG THE ROAD HE HEARD BEHIND HIM THE NOISE OF SOME VEHICLE APPROACHING AT A FURIOUS PACE
AND THAT YOUR ARRIVAL HERE A DAY SOONER OR A DAY LATER
THERE THERE AT THE WINDOW CLOSE BEFORE HIM SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD HAVE ALMOST TOUCHED HIM BEFORE HE STARTED BACK WITH HIS EYES PEERING INTO THE ROOM AND MEETING HIS THERE STOOD THE JEW AND BESIDE HIM WHITE WITH RAGE OR FEAR OR BOTH
AND IN EXACT PROPORTION TO HIS SUCCESS IN THE WORLD BE CAST IN HIS TEETH AND MADE THE SUBJECT OF SNEERS AGAINST HIM HE MAY NO MATTER HOW GENEROUS AND GOOD HIS NATURE
HE JERKED HIMSELF AS IT WERE BY A CONVULSION INTO HIS FORMER ATTITUDE AND LOOKING OUT STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM EMITTED A LONG DEEP WHISTLE WHICH SEEMED AT LAST
AND SOME SLIGHT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR KINDNESS TO OLIVER NOT EXACTLY THAT REJOINED MISTER BROWNLOW LAUGHING BUT WE MUST PROCEED GENTLY AND WITH GREAT CARE GENTLENESS AND CARE EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR
AND WERE WITHAL AS ORIGINAL AND AS MUCH TO THE PURPOSE AS THE REMARKS OF GREAT MEN COMMONLY ARE ABOVE STAIRS THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY FOR THE DOCTOR WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS AND HOWEVER FATIGUED OR THOUGHTFUL HARRY MAYLIE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT FIRST
DEAR ME SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE BOTTLE GREEN COAT HASTILY RISING WITH GREAT POLITENESS I BEG YOUR PARDON YOUNG LADY I IMAGINED IT WAS SOME IMPORTUNATE PERSON WHO I BEG YOU WILL EXCUSE ME
WILL HAVE BEGUN TO THINK BY THIS TIME THAT WE HAVE WEARIED OF HIS COMPANY AND ENTERED INTO SOME DARK CONSPIRACY TO THRUST HIM FORTH UPON THE WORLD
IF THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE HARRY SAID MISSUS MAYLIE
MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG MAN IMPATIENTLY HE WOULD BE A SELFISH BRUTE UNWORTHY ALIKE OF THE NAME OF MAN AND OF THE WOMAN YOU DESCRIBE WHO ACTED THUS YOU THINK SO NOW HARRY REPLIED HIS MOTHER AND EVER WILL SAID THE YOUNG MAN
GRIMWIG WILL YOU LEAVE US FOR A FEW MINUTES I BELIEVE INTERPOSED MISS MAYLIE THAT AT THIS PERIOD OF OUR INTERVIEW I NEED NOT GIVE THAT GENTLEMAN THE TROUBLE OF GOING AWAY IF I AM CORRECTLY INFORMED
THAN HE POURED FORTH A SHOWER OF MINGLED THREATS AND EXECRATIONS THREATENED TO MAKE HER THE FIRST VICTIM OF THE COMBINED INGENUITY OF MESSRS BLATHERS AND DUFF AND ACTUALLY PUT ON HIS HAT PREPARATORY TO SALLYING FORTH TO OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF THOSE WORTHIES
AND WHY SHOULD I SUFFER THE PAIN OF A DELAY IN GIVING THEM VENT WHICH CAN BE PRODUCTIVE OF NO EARTHLY GOOD NO BEFORE I LEAVE THIS PLACE ROSE SHALL HEAR ME SHE SHALL SAID MISSUS MAYLIE
SAID MISTER BROWNLOW RATHER TESTILY WELL THAT I DO SIR REPLIED THE OLD LADY PEOPLE'S EYES AT MY TIME OF LIFE DON'T IMPROVE WITH AGE SIR I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT REJOINED MISTER BROWNLOW
HE ROSE AND LIMPED AS FAST AS HE COULD UP AND DOWN THE ROOM AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES AND THEN STOPPING SUDDENLY BEFORE ROSE KISSED HER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST PREFACE HUSH HE SAID AS THE YOUNG LADY ROSE IN SOME ALARM AT THIS UNUSUAL PROCEEDING
WHETHER HE LIVED THERE AND THEY SAID HE DID LOOK HERE SAID OLIVER OPENING A SCRAP OF PAPER HERE IT IS HERE'S WHERE HE LIVES I'M GOING THERE DIRECTLY OH DEAR ME DEAR ME WHAT SHALL I DO WHEN I COME TO SEE HIM AND
AND IT WAS LATE BEFORE THEY RETIRED WITH LIGHT AND THANKFUL HEARTS TO TAKE THAT REST OF WHICH AFTER THE DOUBT AND SUSPENSE THEY HAD RECENTLY UNDERGONE THEY STOOD MUCH IN NEED OLIVER ROSE NEXT MORNING IN BETTER HEART
HER WORDS AND MANNER HAD TOUCHED ROSE MAYLIE'S HEART AND MINGLED WITH HER LOVE FOR HER YOUNG CHARGE AND SCARCELY LESS INTENSE IN ITS TRUTH AND FERVOUR WAS HER FOND WISH TO WIN THE OUTCAST BACK TO REPENTANCE AND HOPE
IN THE FIRST EXPLOSION OF HIS INDIGNATION HE WOULD REGARD THE INSTRUMENT OF OLIVER'S RECAPTURE TO TRUST HIM WITH THE SECRET WHEN HER REPRESENTATIONS IN THE GIRL'S BEHALF COULD BE SECONDED BY NO EXPERIENCED PERSON
A BURST OF TEARS CAME TO HIS RELIEF AND HE SEEMED TO AWAKEN ALL AT ONCE TO A FULL SENSE OF THE JOYFUL CHANGE THAT HAD OCCURRED AND THE ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE LOAD OF ANGUISH WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIS BREAST THE NIGHT WAS FAST CLOSING IN WHEN HE RETURNED HOMEWARD
ARE IN THE RIGHT BUT THE SOMBRE COLOURS ARE REFLECTIONS FROM THEIR OWN JAUNDICED EYES AND HEARTS THE REAL HUES ARE DELICATE AND NEED A CLEARER VISION IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK AND OLIVER DID NOT FAIL TO NOTE IT AT THE TIME THAT HIS MORNING EXPEDITIONS WERE NO LONGER MADE ALONE
WILL YOU LET ME KNOW WHAT INTELLIGENCE YOU HAVE OF THIS POOR CHILD ALLOWING ME TO PROMISE THAT I EXHAUSTED EVERY MEANS IN MY POWER OF DISCOVERING HIM AND THAT SINCE I HAVE BEEN ABSENT FROM THIS COUNTRY MY FIRST IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD IMPOSED UPON ME
AND WHO CAN WONDER IF IT BE SO MOTHER REJOINED THE YOUNG MAN OR WHY SHOULD I SAY IF IT IS IT IS YOU KNOW IT MOTHER YOU MUST KNOW IT
CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER IT WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH HAPPINESS TO BEAR
TO CALL IN THE AID OF MY FRIEND GRIMWIG HE IS A STRANGE CREATURE BUT A SHREWD ONE AND MIGHT PROVE OF MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO US I SHOULD SAY THAT HE WAS BRED A LAWYER AND QUITTED THE BAR IN DISGUST BECAUSE HE HAD ONLY ONE BRIEF AND A MOTION OF COURSE
INDEED SAID MISTER BROWNLOW OLIVER TWIST YOU KNEW HIM AS REPLIED ROSE THE WORDS NO SOONER ESCAPED HER LIPS
OLIVER KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT HE WAS IN HIS OWN LITTLE ROOM THAT HIS BOOKS WERE LYING ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM THAT THE SWEET AIR WAS STIRRING AMONG THE CREEPING PLANTS OUTSIDE AND YET HE WAS ASLEEP SUDDENLY THE SCENE CHANGED
AND DOUBTLESS HE WOULD IN THIS FIRST OUTBREAK HAVE CARRIED THE INTENTION INTO EFFECT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF HE HAD NOT BEEN RESTRAINED IN PART BY CORRESPONDING VIOLENCE ON THE SIDE OF MISTER BROWNLOW
YET LEFT HER CHAMBER AND THERE WERE NO EVENING WALKS SAVE NOW AND THEN FOR A SHORT DISTANCE WITH MISSUS MAYLIE HE APPLIED HIMSELF WITH REDOUBLED ASSIDUITY TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE WHITE HEADED OLD GENTLEMAN AND LABOURED SO HARD THAT HIS QUICK PROGRESS SURPRISED EVEN HIMSELF
THIS IS GREAT HAPPINESS TO ME GREAT HAPPINESS BUT YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHERE HE IS NOW MISS MAYLIE YOU MUST PARDON MY FINDING FAULT WITH YOU
GOD BE GOOD TO ME CRIED THE OLD LADY EMBRACING HIM IT IS MY INNOCENT BOY MY DEAR OLD NURSE CRIED OLIVER HE WOULD COME BACK I KNEW HE WOULD SAID THE OLD LADY HOLDING HIM IN HER ARMS HOW WELL HE LOOKS
AND MISTER LOSBERNE SAYS THAT ALL DANGER IS AT AN END THE GENTLEMAN SAID NOT ANOTHER WORD BUT OPENING THE CHAISE DOOR LEAPED OUT AND TAKING OLIVER HURRIEDLY BY THE ARM LED HIM ASIDE YOU ARE QUITE CERTAIN
WHICH OCCASIONED HIM NO LITTLE SURPRISE AND PERPLEXITY ROSE ALSO EXPLAINED HER REASONS FOR NOT CONFIDING IN HER FRIEND MISTER LOSBERNE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE OLD GENTLEMAN CONSIDERED THAT SHE HAD ACTED PRUDENTLY
OR HOW COULD SHE POSTPONE THE JOURNEY WITHOUT EXCITING SUSPICION MISTER LOSBERNE WAS WITH THEM AND WOULD BE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS BUT ROSE WAS TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE EXCELLENT GENTLEMAN'S IMPETUOSITY AND FORESAW TOO CLEARLY THE WRATH WITH WHICH
QUICK SHE SAID TELL THEM TO FETCH A HACKNEY COACH AND BE READY TO GO WITH ME I WILL TAKE YOU THERE DIRECTLY WITHOUT A MINUTE'S LOSS OF TIME I WILL ONLY TELL MY AUNT THAT WE ARE GOING OUT FOR AN HOUR AND BE READY AS SOON AS YOU ARE
HE BORE SO STRONG A LIKENESS TO THE OLD LADY THAT OLIVER WOULD HAVE HAD NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN IMAGINING THEIR RELATIONSHIP IF HE HAD NOT ALREADY SPOKEN OF HER AS HIS MOTHER MISSUS MAYLIE WAS ANXIOUSLY WAITING TO RECEIVE HER SON WHEN HE REACHED THE COTTAGE
THE TEARS ROSE TO HER EYES AS SHE PURSUED THIS TRAIN OF REFLECTION HE MIGHT HAVE BY THIS TIME LEARNT TO FORGET HER AND TO BE HAPPIER AWAY DISTURBED BY THESE DIFFERENT REFLECTIONS INCLINING NOW TO ONE COURSE AND THEN TO ANOTHER
AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES LIKE MISFORTUNES SELDOM COME ALONE HER SITUATION WAS INDEED ONE OF NO COMMON TRIAL AND DIFFICULTY
WHEN THE ROOM DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM MISTER GRIMWIG LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND CONVERTING ONE OF THE HIND LEGS OF HIS CHAIR INTO A PIVOT DESCRIBED THREE DISTINCT CIRCLES WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS STICK AND THE TABLE SITTING IN IT ALL THE TIME AFTER PERFORMING THIS EVOLUTION
MUSCULAR FILAMENTS OF THE FACIAL CAPILLARIES WHEREBY BEING DIVESTED OF THEIR ELASTICITY
I MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT AS ALWAYS THOUGHT BROUGHT NO RELEASE IT MERELY INSISTED THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS PROVED AT LAST HE HAD BEEN SEEN SLIPPING UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM HIS ROOM AND AT THE SAME HOUR
THAT MIGHT MAKE MEN WALK UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS BRAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY APPEARED AS MUCH AT SEA AS THE OTHERS
ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE TO DIRECT YOUR BODY WHEN YOUR MIND NO LONGER CONTROLLED IT IT'S A NASTY THOUGHT BUT I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS YOU MEAN CARLOS MAY HAVE MADE ME GO TO THE HALL LAST NIGHT PERHAPS SENT ME TO THE OLD ROOM THOSE OTHER TIMES
THAT'S WHY I'VE COME TO WAKE YOU UP THE MINISTER'S TELEPHONED KATHERINE HE WILL BE HERE BEFORE NOON DO YOU KNOW IT'S AFTER TEN O'CLOCK FOR SOME TIME BOBBY STARED THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE DESOLATE RAGGED LANDSCAPE IT WAS ABNORMALLY COLD EVEN FOR THE LATE FALL
IF THE OLD MAN IN HIS SELFISHNESS HAD PAUSED TO GAZE BEYOND THE INEVITABLE FACT OF DEATH
HENCE AN UNATTACHED MAN WHICH ANY LADY MAY STICK STICK TO OR GET STUCK ON BACKBITER A MOSQUITO BALANCE SOMETHING WANTED BY BOOK KEEPERS AND OFTEN LOST BY TOPERS
CHAPTER SEVEN THE AMAZING MEETING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE OLD COURTYARD BOBBY RETURNED TO HIS BED HE LAY THERE STILL SHIVERING BENEATH THE HEAVY BLANKETS I DON'T DARE HE ECHOED GRAHAM'S WORDS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ANY ONE CAN SAY
AND DEPOSITED ON A DRY PATCH OF GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE MORASS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE INTERIOR THEY CAME UPON A MAN'S COAT MADE OF DARK BROWN STUFF
FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
MISSUS SAVAREEN SAT UP WAITING FOR HER LORD UNTIL LONG PAST MIDNIGHT BUT HER VIGIL WAS IN VAIN LAPIERRE AFTER CLOSING UP HIS INN FOR THE NIGHT DROPPED IN ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE TO SEE IF ANY NEWS OF THE ABSENTEE HAD ARRIVED
YOU SEE I SPENT A GOOD DEAL IN SMITHTOWN YESTERDAY
FROM HIS THICKLY BEARDED FACE HIS REDDISH EYES GLEAMED FORTH WITH A FRESH INSTABILITY THE CLERGYMAN SHOOK HANDS WITH BOBBY WE NEED NOT DELAY YOUR COUSIN IS UPSTAIRS HE INCLUDED THE COMPANY IN HIS CIRCLING TURN OF THE HEAD ANY ONE WHO CARES TO GO
HUMAN BLOCK KNOWN AS THE CRANIUM AND KEPT BY THE SARAH SISTERS SARAH BRUM AND SARAH BELUM ASSISTED BY MEDULLA OBLONGATA
BUT I WAS THERE AND YOU WEREN'T
BIGAMY A FORM OF INSANITY IN WHICH A MAN INSISTS ON PAYING THREE BOARD BILLS INSTEAD OF TWO BILLIOUSNESS A LIVER COMPLAINT OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR PIETY BILL OF FARE A LIST OF EATABLES
WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT THIS EFFECTUALLY DISPOSED OF ANY POSSIBLE THEORY AS TO JONATHAN AND HIS WIFE HAVING MISTAKEN SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SAVAREEN SQUIRE HARRINGTON LIKEWISE LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE MAN'S DOINGS ON THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
OR AT THE VERY OUTSIDE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER OR HE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED BY LAPIERRE
WONDERFUL PARENTS ARE YET TO BE HEARD FROM WHO DON'T THINK THEIRS IS A WONDER A NOCTURNAL ANIMAL TO WHICH EVERYONE IN A SLEEPING CAR IS EAGER TO GIVE A WIDE BERTH BACHELOR FROM LATIN BACULUS A STICK UNATTACHED
FOR ONCE HE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE FOREST BECAUSE IT HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO GLANCE PERPETUALLY BACK AT THAT DISMAL AND PENSIVE PICTURE THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF TWIGS HASTILY LOPPED OFF OF BUSHES BENT AND TORN OF THE UNCOVERING THROUGH THESE CARELESS MEANS OF AN OLD PATH
HE GLANCED AWAY WHILE THE ANGRY COLOUR LEFT HIS FACE HE WAS A LITTLE DAZED BY THE REALIZATION THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO GRAHAM AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO AN ENEMY AS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HOWELLS IN THE OLD BEDROOM HE FELT THE TOUCH OF GRAHAM'S HAND ON HIS SHOULDER I'M ONLY WORKING IN YOUR SERVICE GRAHAM SAID KINDLY
THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
AS BELONG TO SAVAREEN IT WAS WET AND BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND IN FACT WAS LYING HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF A LITTLE PUDDLE OF WATER WHEN IT WAS FOUND THEN THE SEARCHERS MADE SURE OF FINDING THE BODY BUT IN THIS THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED
PRAECORDIA BOARD AN IMPLEMENT FOR ADMINISTERING CORPORAL PUNISHMENT USED BY MOTHERS AND LAND LADIES THE FESTIVE BOARD MAY BE A SHINGLE A HAIR BRUSH
FROM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH DOCTOR SCOTT THE LOCAL CORONER HELD HIMSELF IN READINESS TO SUMMON A CORONER'S JURY AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE WHEN ALL THESE MEASURES PROVED UNAVAILING A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE INHABITANTS WAS CONVENED AND FUNDS WERE SUBSCRIBED TO STILL FURTHER PROSECUTE THE SEARCH
AS IF FLEEING FROM AN IMMATERIAL THING SUDDENLY QUICKENED WITH THE POWER OF ACCUSATION HE COULD PICTURE THE FRESH OBLONG EXCAVATION IN THE SOIL OF THE FAMILY BURIAL GROUND
BONE ONE DOLLAR THE ORIGINAL PRICE OF A WIFE NOTE ADAM WHO HAD TO GIVE UP ONE BONE BEFORE HE GOT EVE BONNETS A FEMALE HEAD TROUBLE WHICH IS CONTRACTED THE LATTER PART OF LENT AND BREAKS OUT ON EASTER BOODLE
GRAHAM INTERRUPTED WITH A FLAT DEMAND FOR AN EXPLANATION HOW DID YOU GET AWAY
THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO LEARN HOW HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE APPARENT MIRACLES
PERRY PROFESSED TO HAVE SEEN AND CONVERSED WITH HIM THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT INTERVIEW AND CONVERSATION HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND SAVAREEN HAD RIDDEN NORTHWARD FROM THE GATE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS HE COULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED
DISTINGUISHED FROM MENU BY FIGURES IN THE RIGHT HAND COLUMN BIOGRAPH A STEREOPTICON PICTURE TAKEN WITH A CHILL AND SHOWN WITH TREMORS BIRDIE
YOUR PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE WAS THE LAST STRAW YOU WILL FORGIVE US CARLOS
IN FACT HE HAD NOT WORN IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PREVIOUSLY HIS WIFE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING FOLDED AND LAID IT AWAY IN THE TOP OF A LARGE TRUNK ON THE SATURDAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST SINCE WHICH TIME SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON IT HERE WAS A DEEPENING OF THE MYSTERY
AFTER THIS SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT PAREDES'S DETENTION HE HADN'T DREAMED THAT HIS WEARINESS COULD PLACATE EVEN MOMENTARILY SUCH REFLECTIONS BUT AT LAST HE SLEPT AGAIN
GAVE ME THE CREEPS TOO MAKES ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE HAS AN ABOMINABLY DEEP PURPOSE IN USING HIS WITS TO HANG ON HERE HE SUGGESTS RESOURCES AS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AS ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE OLD ROOM YOU'LL CONFESS BOBBY HE'S HAD A GOOD DEAL OF INFLUENCE OVER YOU AN INFLUENCE FOR EVIL
AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EVIDENCE BOBBY DEFENDED HIMSELF IF IT HAD BEEN STOLEN EARLIER THE COAT POCKET MIGHT HAVE RETAINED ITS BULGING SHAPE
BUT FOUND NOTHING FURTHER TO REWARD THEIR SEARCH THE GROUND WAS TOO SOFT AND MARSHY TO RETAIN ANY TRACES OF FOOTSTEPS AND THE MARE AND SADDLE FURNISHED THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT THE OBJECT OF THEIR QUEST HAD BEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SWAMP AND OF COURSE THIS EVIDENCE WAS OF THE MOST VAGUE AND INCONCLUSIVE CHARACTER
CAN BE FOUND ON THE OUTSIDE OF A SHORT RED STEER OR THE INSIDE OF A LONG BLACK BOTTLE BRASS BAND A CLEVER THOUGH SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED ARRANGEMENT FOR HOLDING A CROWD TOGETHER BRICK AN ADMIRABLE PERSON MADE OF THE RIGHT SORT OF CLAY AND POSSESSING PLENTY OF SAND
SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
IT'S NATURAL ENOUGH HE SHOULD BE HERE BOBBY AGREED INDIFFERENTLY THEY WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE GRAHAM MADE IT PLAIN THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR FROM THE SAD BUSINESS AHEAD
SO FOR THE SECOND TIME THE LIVING MET THE DEAD AND THE LAW WATCHED HOPEFULLY
DULL CLOUDS OBSCURED THE SUN AND FURNISHED AN ILLUSION OF CROWDING EARTHWARD A FUNEREAL DAY THE WORDS SLIPPED INTO HIS MIND HE REPEATED THEM WHEN YOUR GRANDFATHER'S BURIED GRAHAM ANSWERED SOFTLY WE'LL ALL FEEL HAPPIER WHY BOBBY ASKED
A STITCH IN TIME SAVES EMBARRASSING EXPOSURE
GRAHAM ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ILL AT EASE
AND WHITE AND FURNISHED WITH LIGHT AND HEAT HOT OR COLD WATER IF DESIRED
WHEN BOBBY HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HE FOUND IN SPITE OF HIS MENTAL TURMOIL THAT HIS SLEEP HAD DONE HIM GOOD WHILE HE BREAKFASTED GRAHAM URGED HIM TO EAT TRIED TO DRIVE FROM HIS BRAIN THE MORBID AFTERMATH OF LAST NIGHT'S REVEALING MOMENT
HE WOULD HAVE GUARDED WITH A MORE PRECIOUS INTEREST THE DRAPINGS OF HIS FINAL SLEEP THIS NECESSARY TASK ON WHICH BOBBY HAD STUMBLED HAD MADE THE THICKET LESS CONGENIAL THAN THE HOUSE AS HE WALKED BACK HE FORECASTED WITH A KEEN APPREHENSION HIS APPROACHING ORDEAL
AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
IT WON'T LESSEN THE FACT OF HIS MURDER TIME GRAHAM SAID LESSENS SUCH FACTS EVEN FOR THE POLICE BOBBY GLANCED AT HIM FLUSHING YOU MEAN YOU'VE DECIDED TO STAND BY ME AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT GRAHAM SMILED
A STRANGE MAN APPEARED WALKING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE HIS BLACK CLOTHING RELIEVED ONLY BY NARROW EDGES OF WHITE CUFFS BETWEEN THE SLEEVES AND THE HEAVY MOURNING GLOVES FITTED WITH SOLEMN HARMONY INTO THE LANDSCAPE AND BOBBY'S MOOD
SIMPLE ENOUGH MISTER GRAHAM I TELEPHONED AS SOON AS RAWLINS GOT ME TO THE BASTILLE I COMMUNICATED WITH THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS THE COMPANY FOR WHICH I ONCE WORKED HE'S A PROMINENT AND BRILLIANT MAN HE PLANNED IT WITH SOME LOCAL FELLOW WHEN I WAS ARRAIGNED AT THE OPENING OF COURT THIS MORNING
BOWER A SHADY RETREAT IN GENERAL BOWERY A SHADY RETREAT IN NEW YORK BRACE SECURITY FOR THE TROUSERS BRACER SECURITY FOR THE STOMACH BRACELET SECURITY FOR THE PAWN BROKER BRAIN
ROBINSON ENTERED THE FLESH AROUND HIS EYES WAS PUFFIER THAN IT HAD BEEN YESTERDAY WORRY HAD INCREASED THE INCONGRUOUS DISCONTENT OF HIS ROUND FACE CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT LITTLE I SAW YOU ARRIVE HE SAID RAWLINS WARNED ME
HIS SHARP EXCLAMATION RECALLED HOWELLS'S REPORT WHICH AT THEIR DIRECTION HE HAD FAILED TO MAIL HAD HIS EXCLAMATION BEEN DRAWN BY AN ACCUSER BOBBY STARTED TO RISE GRAHAM MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR THEN JENKINS ENTERED AND STOOD TO ONE SIDE
HE WAS AROUSED BY THE TRAMPING OF MEN AROUND THE HOUSE AND STRANGE HARSH VOICES HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW AND GLANCED FROM THE WINDOW IT HAD LONG BEEN DAYLIGHT TWO BURLY FELLOWS IN OVERALLS CARRYING PICK AND SPADE ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
GRAHAM FROWNED IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH YOUR SLEEP WALKING LAST NIGHT YET IT'S AS CLEAR AS EVER THAT MARIA AND HE ARE UP TO SOME GAME IN WHICH YOU FIGURE HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL BOBBY PERSISTED GET UP GRAHAM ADVISED
BOBBY WENT IN WITH THE OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT HE CATALOGUED REMEMBERED OBJECTS ALL INTIMATE TO HIS GRANDFATHER EACH ODDLY ENTANGLED IN HIS MIND WITH HIS DISLIKE OF THE OLD MAN THE IRON BED THE CHEST OF DRAWERS
YET THAT FLASH OF TEMPER HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO FACE THE ORDEAL A LINGERING RESENTMENT AT GRAHAM'S SUGGESTION LESSENED THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION ENTERING THE COURT HE SCARCELY GLANCED AT THE BLACK WAGON THERE WERE MORE DARK CLOTHED MEN IN THE HALL RAWLINS HAD RETURNED
AND WAS ABLE TO FIX THE TIME AT WHICH HE HAD STARTED FOR HOME HE HAD RIDDEN FROM THE DOOR OF THE PEACOCK AT ABOUT A QUARTER TO EIGHT
THE FORMER EASY MANNERED UNCOMMUNICATIVE FOREIGNER HE APPEARED MOREOVER TO HAVE SLEPT PLEASANTLY HIS EYES SHOWED NO WEARINESS HIS CLOTHING NO DISARRANGEMENT HE SPOKE AT ONCE
HE EMERGED FROM THE FOREST AND SAW AGAIN THE LEISURELY WEAVING OF THE SMOKE SHROUD ABOVE THE HOUSE THEN HIS EYES WERE DRAWN BY THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF A PAIR OF HORSES
DEAD OR ALIVE OR WHICH SHOULD THROW ANY LIGHT UPON HIS FATE HAND BILLS PROCLAIMING THIS REWARD AND DESCRIBING THE MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE WERE EXHIBITED IN EVERY BAR ROOM AND OTHER CONSPICUOUS PLACE THROUGHOUT WESTCHESTER AND THE ADJACENT TOWNSHIPS
LATER MISTER GRAHAM THERE IS A HACK DRIVER OUTSIDE WHO IS EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN YOU HE WANTS TO BE PAID I ASKED RAWLINS TO DRIVE ME BACK BUT HE RUSHED FROM THE COURTHOUSE PROBABLY TO TELEPHONE HIS ROTUND SUPERIOR
FROM A SENSE OF SHAME ANGER OR OTHER CAUSE
I DON'T MIND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OUT OF IT

CHAPTER TWO PRESIDENT BARBICANE'S COMMUNICATION ON THE FIFTH OF OCTOBER AT EIGHT P M A DENSE CROWD PRESSED TOWARD THE SALOONS OF THE GUN CLUB
THE MEETING FELT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOW APPROACHING THE CRITICAL POINT AND REDOUBLED THEIR ATTENTION ACCORDINGLY FOR SOME MONTHS PAST MY BRAVE COLLEAGUES CONTINUED BARBICANE I HAVE BEEN ASKING MYSELF WHETHER WHILE CONFINING OURSELVES TO OUR OWN PARTICULAR OBJECTS
WHICH MET WITH SUCH SUCCESS IN FRANCE SOMEWHAT LATER ANOTHER FRENCHMAN NAMED FONTENELLE WROTE THE PLURALITY OF WORLDS A
NO TRUE YANKEE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED EVEN THE SEMBLANCE OF A DIFFICULTY TO BE POSSIBLE A THING WITH THEM IS NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE THE TRIUMPHAL PROGRESS OF THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE EVENING IT WAS A REGULAR TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION
TO EMPTY THE HEAD NOTE WOMEN WHO HAVE CAPTIVATED MEN CAPE A NECK IN THE SEA CAPER A FOOT IN THE AIR
COULD NOT HAVE MORE VIOLENTLY SET IN MOTION THE WAVES OF SOUND ONE NEED NOT BE SURPRISED AT THIS THERE ARE SOME CANNONEERS NEARLY AS NOISY AS THEIR OWN GUNS BARBICANE REMAINED CALM IN THE MIDST OF THIS ENTHUSIASTIC CLAMOR
IT SPREAD EQUALLY AMONG ALL CLASSES OF CITIZENS MEN OF SCIENCE SHOPKEEPERS MERCHANTS PORTERS CHAIR MEN AS WELL AS GREENHORNS WERE STIRRED IN THEIR INNERMOST FIBRES A NATIONAL ENTERPRISE WAS AT STAKE THE WHOLE CITY
IT WOULD BE BUT JUST AND FAIR RETURNED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY
AND THEIR PROJECTILES EXCEEDING THE PRESCRIBED LIMITS UNFORTUNATELY OCCASIONALLY CUT IN TWO SOME UNOFFENDING PEDESTRIANS THESE INVENTIONS IN FACT LEFT FAR IN THE REAR THE TIMID INSTRUMENTS OF EUROPEAN ARTILLERY
BUT THE POINT IN WHICH THE AMERICANS SINGULARLY DISTANCED THE EUROPEANS WAS IN THE SCIENCE OF GUNNERY NOT INDEED THAT THEIR WEAPONS RETAINED A HIGHER DEGREE OF PERFECTION THAN THEIRS
AND SIMILAR SMALL ARMS MET WITH LITTLE CONSIDERATION
IT IS BUT FAIR TO ADD THAT THESE YANKEES BRAVE AS THEY HAVE EVER PROVED THEMSELVES TO BE DID NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THEORIES AND FORMULAE BUT THAT THEY PAID HEAVILY IN PROPRIA PERSONA FOR THEIR INVENTIONS AMONG THEM
CONTRACTED IN A PENNSYLVANIA BLAST FURNACE

ANTECEDENTS OF THE GUN CLUB AND IT CANNOT FAIL TO MAKE SOME NOISE IN THE WORLD A THRILL OF EXCITEMENT RAN THROUGH THE MEETING BARBICANE HAVING BY A RAPID MOVEMENT FIRMLY FIXED HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD CALMLY CONTINUED HIS HARANGUE
SHALL WE NOT EMPLOY THESE REMAINING YEARS OF OUR LIFE IN PERFECTING FIREARMS SHALL THERE NEVER BE A FRESH OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING THE RANGES OF PROJECTILES SHALL THE AIR NEVER AGAIN BE LIGHTED WITH THE GLARE OF OUR GUNS NO INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTY EVER ARISE

CHAPTER THREE EFFECT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMUNICATION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY THE LAST WORDS OF THE HONORABLE PRESIDENT THE CRIES THE SHOUTS THE SUCCESSION OF ROARS HURRAHS AND ALL THE VARIED VOCIFERATIONS
ON THAT EVENING A STRANGER WHO MIGHT HAVE CHANCED TO BE IN BALTIMORE COULD NOT HAVE GAINED ADMISSION FOR LOVE OR MONEY INTO THE GREAT HALL THAT WAS RESERVED EXCLUSIVELY FOR RESIDENT OR CORRESPONDING MEMBERS NO ONE ELSE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE OBTAINED A PLACE AND
NEVERTHELESS I AM BOUND TO ADD THAT SOME PRACTICAL GENIUSES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ESTABLISH ACTUAL COMMUNICATION WITH HER THUS A FEW DAYS AGO A GERMAN GEOMETRICIAN PROPOSED TO SEND A SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION TO THE STEPPES OF SIBERIA
FROM THE GENTLEMAN LOUNGING UPON THE BARROOM SETTEE WITH HIS TUMBLER OF SHERRY COBBLER BEFORE HIM DOWN TO THE WATERMAN WHO GOT DRUNK UPON HIS KNOCK ME DOWN IN THE DINGY TAVERNS OF FELL POINT ABOUT TWO A M HOWEVER
ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION RESIDENT IN BALTIMORE ATTENDED THE INVITATION OF THEIR PRESIDENT AS REGARDS THE CORRESPONDING MEMBERS NOTICES WERE DELIVERED BY HUNDREDS THROUGHOUT THE STREETS OF THE CITY AND LARGE AS WAS THE GREAT HALL

IT WAS QUITE INADEQUATE TO ACCOMMODATE THE CROWD OF SAVANTS THEY OVERFLOWED INTO THE ADJOINING ROOMS DOWN THE NARROW PASSAGES INTO THE OUTER COURTYARDS THERE THEY RAN AGAINST THE VULGAR HERD WHO PRESSED UP TO THE DOORS EACH STRUGGLING TO REACH THE FRONT RANKS

THEY WON'T TRUST ME IN THE LAKE FOR A SINGLE NIGHT YOU SEE WHERE THAT GREEN LIGHT IS BURNING THAT IS THE WINDOW OF MY ROOM NOW IF YOU WOULD JUST SWIM THERE WITH ME VERY QUIETLY AND WHEN WE ARE ALL BUT UNDER THE BALCONY
AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER PRINCESS SAID HE BUT AT THE MOMENT UP STARTED THE PRINCESS CRYING I'M AFLOAT I'M AFLOAT AND THE LITTLE BOAT BUMPED AGAINST THE STONE PRINCESS
THE PRINCE MEANTIME STOOD IN THE WATER STARING AND FORGETTING TO GET OUT BUT THE PRINCESS DISAPPEARING HE SCRAMBLED ON SHORE AND WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TREE
THE PEOPLE OBEYED HER AND WENT PRESENTLY A LITTLE WAVE FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED ONE OF THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT MUCH
ONE DAY HE LOST SIGHT OF HIS RETINUE IN A GREAT FOREST THESE FORESTS ARE VERY USEFUL IN DELIVERING PRINCES FROM THEIR COURTIERS LIKE A SIEVE THAT KEEPS BACK THE BRAN THEN THE PRINCES GET AWAY TO FOLLOW THEIR FORTUNES
AND MORE NEARLY DROWNED THAN SHE HAD EVER EXPECTED TO BE FOR THE WATER HAD GOT INTO HER THROAT AS OFTEN AS SHE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK AT THE PLACE TO WHICH HE BORE HER THE BANK WAS ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE WATER
IN THIS WAY THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRINCESSES WHO ARE FORCED TO MARRY BEFORE THEY HAVE HAD A BIT OF FUN I WISH OUR PRINCESSES GOT LOST IN A FOREST SOMETIMES ONE LOVELY EVENING AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR MANY DAYS
NO PRINCE HOWEVER WOULD JUDGE OF A PRINCESS BY WEIGHT THE LOVELINESS OF HER FOOT HE WOULD HARDLY ESTIMATE BY THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION IT COULD MAKE IN MUD PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE IN THE WATER YOU STUPID
HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN THE PRINCESS GAVE HIM SOME WINE FOR THE LAST TIME HE WAS PAST EATING THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND LOOKED AT HIM THE WATER ROSE AND ROSE
IT TOUCHED HIS CHIN IT TOUCHED HIS LOWER LIP IT TOUCHED BETWEEN HIS LIPS HE SHUT THEM HARD TO KEEP IT OUT THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO FEEL STRANGE IT TOUCHED HIS UPPER LIP
HE TURNED TOWARDS THE PRINCESS AND SAID HOW AM I TO PUT YOU IN THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS SHE ANSWERED QUITE SNAPPISHLY
BUT WHEN SHE DID SHE FAINTED AWAY COMING TO HERSELF SHE SEIZED THE OARS KEPT HERSELF STEADY AS BEST SHE COULD AND ROWED AND ROWED THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ROWED BEFORE ROUND ROCKS AND OVER SHALLOWS AND THROUGH MUD SHE ROWED
LOVE AND WATER BROUGHT BACK ALL HER STRENGTH SHE GOT UNDER THE WATER AND PULLED AND PULLED WITH HER WHOLE MIGHT TILL AT LAST SHE GOT ONE LEG OUT THE OTHER EASILY FOLLOWED HOW SHE GOT HIM INTO THE BOAT SHE NEVER COULD TELL
AT LEAST I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHERE IT IS I WISH I HADN'T ONE EITHER REJOINED THE PRINCESS IT IS SO STUPID I HAVE A GREAT MIND SHE CONTINUED TO PLAY THEM ALL A TRICK WHY COULDN'T THEY LEAVE ME ALONE
AND THE BUBBLES OF HIS LAST BREATH BUBBLED UP THROUGH THE WATER THE PRINCESS GAVE A SHRIEK AND SPRANG INTO THE LAKE SHE LAID HOLD FIRST OF ONE LEG AND THEN OF THE OTHER AND PULLED AND TUGGED BUT SHE COULD NOT MOVE EITHER SHE STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A SHOEBLACK SAID THE PRINCESS SO I AM SAID THE PRINCE I BLACKED YOUR LITTLE BOOTS THREE TIMES A DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL I COULD GET OF YOU PUT ME IN
IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE GOING UP REJOINED SHE MY FEELING WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF ELEVATION TOO THE PRINCE CONCEDED THE PRINCESS DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM FOR SHE RETORTED HIS QUESTION
AND WHERE EVEN IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT HE WOULD BE IN NO DANGER OF BEING DISCOVERED FROM THE OPPOSITE SHORE IT WAS A SORT OF CAVE IN THE ROCK WHERE HE PROVIDED HIMSELF A BED OF WITHERED LEAVES AND LAY DOWN TOO TIRED FOR HUNGER TO KEEP HIM AWAKE
AND THEY SAW OTHER CADIS PASHAS AND EFFENDIS COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
THEY SAID NOT A WORD TO HIS SISTER THE THING WAS EXECUTED FOR A LITTLE MONEY AND THEY HAD THE DOUBLE PLEASURE OF ENTRAPPING A JESUIT AND PUNISHING THE PRIDE OF A GERMAN BARON
VERY WELL SAID THE PRINCE AND CATCHING HER UP IN HIS ARMS HE SPRANG WITH HER FROM THE ROCK THE PRINCESS HAD JUST TIME TO GIVE ONE DELIGHTED SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER BEFORE THE WATER CLOSED OVER THEM
IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN PUT INTO THE INQUISITION IF YOU HAD NOT WALKED OVER AMERICA IF YOU HAD NOT STABBED THE BARON IF YOU HAD NOT LOST ALL YOUR SHEEP FROM THE FINE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE EATING PRESERVED CITRONS AND PISTACHIO NUTS
HE NEVER DREAMED THAT SHE COULD BEWITCH HIM FOR WHAT INDEED COULD A PRINCE DO WITH A PRINCESS THAT HAD LOST HER GRAVITY WHO COULD TELL WHAT SHE MIGHT NOT LOSE NEXT SHE MIGHT LOSE HER VISIBILITY OR HER TANGIBILITY
AND THE PRINCESS SAT AND LOOKED AT HIM SHE FED HIM NOW AND THEN THE NIGHT WORE ON THE WATERS ROSE AND ROSE THE MOON ROSE LIKEWISE HIGHER AND HIGHER
SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AND LISTENED STRANGE SOUNDS CAME ACROSS THE WATER IT WAS IN FACT THE PRINCESS LAUGHING NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD IN HER LAUGH AS I HAVE ALREADY HINTED
IT IS NATURAL TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER SO MANY DISASTERS CANDIDE MARRIED AND LIVING WITH THE PHILOSOPHER PANGLOSS THE PHILOSOPHER MARTIN THE PRUDENT CACAMBO AND THE OLD WOMAN
HIS WIFE BECAME UGLIER EVERY DAY MORE PEEVISH AND UNSUPPORTABLE THE OLD WOMAN WAS INFIRM AND EVEN MORE FRETFUL THAN CUNEGONDE CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE
THOUGHT THE PRINCE BUT YOU ARE WORTH DYING FOR AFTER ALL AGAIN A WAVELET AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED BOTH THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK OR MOVE
HE TURNED ALMOST EXPECTING TO SEE HER STILL BY HIS SIDE BUT HE WAS ALONE IN THE WATER SO HE SWAM AWAY QUIETLY AND WATCHED THE LIGHTS ROVING ABOUT THE SHORE FOR HOURS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS SAFE IN HER CHAMBER
WHAT BUSINESS HAD YOU TO PULL ME DOWN OUT OF THE WATER AND THROW ME TO THE BOTTOM OF THE AIR I NEVER DID YOU ANY HARM PARDON ME I DID NOT MEAN TO HURT YOU I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY BRAINS AND THAT IS A WORSE LOSS THAN YOUR WRETCHED GRAVITY
HE FOUND THAT HE WAS APPROACHING THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS FOREST FOR THE TREES HAD GOT SO THIN THAT HE COULD SEE THE SUNSET THROUGH THEM AND HE SOON CAME UPON A KIND OF HEATH NEXT HE CAME UPON SIGNS OF HUMAN NEIGHBOURHOOD
AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
TWO THREE FOUR HOURS PASSED IN THIS WAY THE PRINCESS APPARENTLY ASLEEP AND THE PRINCE VERY PATIENT BUT HE WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED IN HIS POSITION FOR HE HAD NONE OF THE CONSOLATION HE HAD HOPED FOR
THERE IS A CONCATENATION OF EVENTS IN THIS BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS
YES I WILL ANSWERED THE PRINCESS AND KISSED HIM WITH A LONG SWEET COLD KISS NOW SAID HE WITH A SIGH OF CONTENT I DIE HAPPY
DIONYSIUS OF SYRACUSE PYRRHUS PERSEUS HANNIBAL JUGURTHA ARIOVISTUS CAESAR POMPEY NERO OTHO VITELLIUS DOMITIAN
AND ONE MUST ALLOW THAT SHE HAD GOOD CAUSE TO FEEL PROVOKED WITH THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN HAD IT BEEN THE KING HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE FARED NO BETTER BUT BOTH HE AND THE QUEEN WERE FAST ASLEEP AND THE CHAMBERLAIN WENT BACK TO HIS BED
ANSWERED THE PRINCESS COME THEN SAID THE PRINCE THE CONDITION OF HER DRESS INCREASING HER USUAL DIFFICULTY IN WALKING COMPELLED HER TO CLING TO HIM AND HE COULD HARDLY PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT IN A DELIGHTFUL DREAM
THERE IS HORRIBLE EVIL IN THIS WORLD WHAT SIGNIFIES IT SAID THE DERVISH WHETHER THERE BE EVIL OR GOOD WHEN HIS HIGHNESS SENDS A SHIP TO EGYPT DOES HE TROUBLE HIS HEAD WHETHER THE MICE ON BOARD ARE AT THEIR EASE OR NOT
AND THAT MADE HER THINK THAT HE COULD NOT GET ANY BREATH SHE WAS FRANTIC SHE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND HELD HIS HEAD ABOVE THE WATER WHICH WAS POSSIBLE NOW HIS HANDS WERE NO LONGER ON THE HOLE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE FOR HE WAS PAST BREATHING
I CONTENT MYSELF WITH SENDING THERE FOR SALE THE FRUITS OF THE GARDEN WHICH I CULTIVATE HAVING SAID THESE WORDS HE INVITED THE STRANGERS INTO HIS HOUSE HIS TWO SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS PRESENTED THEM WITH SEVERAL SORTS OF SHERBET WHICH THEY MADE THEMSELVES
DON'T YOU LIKE FALLING IN THEN SAID THE PRINCE IT IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL FUN I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE ANSWERED SHE I NEVER FELL BEFORE I WISH I COULD LEARN
ATHALIAH BY JEHOIADA THE KINGS JEHOIAKIM JECONIAH AND ZEDEKIAH WERE LED INTO CAPTIVITY
WHERE THEY HAD ALREADY PLACED A LITTLE BOAT FOR HER THE WATER WAS NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT IT BUT THEY HOPED IT WOULD BE BEFORE LONG THEY LAID HER ON CUSHIONS PLACED IN THE BOAT WINES AND FRUITS AND OTHER NICE THINGS AND STRETCHED A CANOPY OVER ALL
CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT
ANSWERED SHE WITH CONDESCENSION AND SITTING DOWN SHE DID LOOK AT HIM AND KEPT LOOKING AT HIM WITH WONDERFUL STEADINESS CONSIDERING ALL THINGS THE SUN WENT DOWN AND THE MOON ROSE
THAT WOULD HAVE SENT HER ALOFT AGAIN BUT FOR THE HOLD SHE HAD OF HIS ARM PUT ME UP DIRECTLY PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER ALMOST ALREADY
BUT THE EXTREME IMPERTINENCE OF THE BARON DETERMINED HIM TO CONCLUDE THE MATCH
YOU MUST HAVE A VAST AND MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID CANDIDE TO THE TURK I HAVE ONLY TWENTY ACRES REPLIED THE OLD MAN I AND MY CHILDREN CULTIVATE THEM OUR LABOUR PRESERVES US FROM THREE GREAT EVILS WEARINESS VICE AND WANT
FOR HE MADE A GOOD JOINER AND BECAME A VERY HONEST MAN
LET US WORK SAID MARTIN WITHOUT DISPUTING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO RENDER LIFE TOLERABLE THE WHOLE LITTLE SOCIETY ENTERED INTO THIS LAUDABLE DESIGN ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT ABILITIES THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
ASKED THE OLD MAN WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE STRANGLED MUFTI I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED THE WORTHY MAN AND I HAVE NOT KNOWN THE NAME OF ANY MUFTI NOR OF ANY VIZIER I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
SO HE GAVE HER A STRONG LIFT OUT OF THE WATER TO LAY HER ON THE BANK BUT HER GRAVITATION CEASING THE MOMENT SHE LEFT THE WATER AWAY SHE WENT UP INTO THE AIR SCOLDING AND SCREAMING
WHAT THEN MUST WE DO SAID PANGLOSS HOLD YOUR TONGUE ANSWERED THE DERVISH I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL
IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WHO TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF THE DIFFERENT SENTINELS
BUT GOOD FEELINGS SOON GOT THE BETTER OF HIS ANTIPATHIES AND HE CONTINUED MORE MILDLY BUT STILL THAT IS A SIN WHICH I THINK MAY BE FORGIVEN IF SINCERELY REPENTED OF AND IT MATTERS BUT LITTLE
AND FROM THE LION REFT HIS SKIN THE FOUL BIRDS WITH SURE DARTS HE SLEW THE GOLDEN FRUIT HE STOLE IN VAIN THE DRAGON'S WATCH WITH TRIPLE CHAIN FROM HELL'S DEPTHS CERBERUS HE DREW
BECAUSE ORDINARY SPEECH IS APT TO ASSERT AND THAT FREQUENTLY THAT SOME MEN'S FORTUNE IS BAD
AS A MAN OF MOST EXEMPLARY PIETY AND HOLINESS OF LIFE THE SERGEANT WAS MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS OF AGE AND FOR HALF THAT PERIOD HE HAD BORNE ARMS
AND I FIND IT A GREAT STRENGTHENER IN TIME OF NEED WHILE SPEAKING HE TOOK A BIBLE FROM HIS POCKET AND OFFERED IT TO THE PEDDLER BIRCH RECEIVED THE VOLUME WITH HABITUAL REVERENCE BUT THERE WAS AN ABSTRACTED AIR ABOUT HIM AND A WANDERING OF THE EYE
WELL LET HER THEN BUT BE CAREFUL THAT THIS WILY PEDDLER DOES NOT GET OUT IN THE FOLDS OF HER PETTICOATS
THEY CANNOT BESTOW FULL AND ABSOLUTE GOOD BUT THAT THEY BECOME THE TRUE GOOD WHEN THEY ARE GATHERED AS IT WERE INTO ONE FORM AND AGENCY SO THAT THAT WHICH IS INDEPENDENCE IS LIKEWISE POWER REVERENCE RENOWN
THAT INDUCED HIS COMPANION TO THINK THAT ALARM WAS GETTING THE MASTERY OF THE PEDDLER'S FEELINGS ACCORDINGLY
I NEVER WAS A SOLDIER THEREFORE NEVER COULD DESERT SAID THE PEDDLER RESTING HIS FACE ON HIS HAND IN A MELANCHOLY ATTITUDE WHY DESERTION CONSISTS OF MORE THAN QUITTING YOUR COLORS THOUGH THAT IS CERTAINLY THE WORST KIND
THAT A MAN MUST BE PUT TO SLEEP IN THE ROOM WID HER YE RAPSCALLION POOH DO YOU MIND A FELLOW WHO'S TO BE HANGED IN THE MORNING YOU SEE HE SLEEPS ALREADY TO MORROW HE'LL TAKE A LONGER NAP HANDS OFF YE VILLAIN CRIED THE WASHERWOMAN
OF HER FAVORITE CAPTAIN JOHN LAWTON IN SEARCH OF REDRESS
THEY CANNOT QUICKLY WITHER AND DIE SOME SPRING UP IN THE PLAINS OTHERS IN THE MOUNTAINS SOME GROW IN MARSHES OTHERS CLING TO ROCKS AND OTHERS AGAIN FIND A FERTILE SOIL IN THE BARREN SANDS
TEN YEARS A TEDIOUS WARFARE RAGED ERE ILIUM'S SMOKING RUINS PAID
A SECOND SOLDIER WHO WAS STATIONED NEAR THE HOUSE TO PROTECT THE HORSES OF THE OFFICERS COULD COMMAND A VIEW OF THE OUTSIDE OF THE APARTMENT AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT WINDOW OR OUTLET OF ANY KIND EXCEPTING ITS DOOR
ANY MORE THAN IT BECOMES A BRAVE SOLDIER TO BE OFFENDED
I RECOMMEND YOU TO SAY YOUR PRAYERS AND THEN TO GET SOME REST IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY DO BOTH THERE IS NO HOPE OF YOUR BEING PARDONED FOR COLONEL SINGLETON
THEN ALL THAT ERROR'S MISTS OBSCURED SHALL SHINE MORE CLEAR THAN LIGHT THIS FLESHLY FRAME'S OBLIVIOUS WEIGHT HATH QUENCHED NOT REASON QUITE THE GERMS OF TRUTH STILL LIE WITHIN WHENCE WE BY LEARNING
IF ANYTHING LIES HEAVY ON YOUR MIND NOW IS THE BEST TIME TO GET RID OF IT
NOTHING COULD BE MORE TRULY THOUGHT OUT EITHER THERE IS NO SINGLE END TO WHICH ALL THINGS ARE RELATIVE OR ELSE THE END TO WHICH ALL THINGS UNIVERSALLY HASTEN MUST BE THE HIGHEST GOOD OF ALL THEN SHE
HIS MEDITATIONS WERE HOWEVER SOON INTERRUPTED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE WASHERWOMAN
OR TRIAL OF THE GOOD AND THE PUNISHING OR AMENDING OF THE BAD EVERY FORTUNE MUST BE GOOD SINCE IT IS EITHER JUST OR USEFUL THE REASONING IS EXCEEDING TRUE SAID I THE CONCLUSION SO LONG AS I REFLECT UPON THE PROVIDENCE AND FATE OF WHICH THOU HAST TAUGHT ME
NOW THAT WHICH SEEKS TO SUBSIST AND CONTINUE DESIRES TO BE ONE FOR IF ITS ONENESS BE GONE ITS VERY EXISTENCE CANNOT CONTINUE TRUE SAID I ALL THINGS THEN DESIRE TO BE ONE I AGREE
HOLLISTER CONCLUDED HIS INJUNCTIONS TO THE MAN IN THE SHED BY SAYING YOUR LIFE WILL DEPEND ON HIS NOT ESCAPING LET NONE ENTER OR QUIT THE ROOM TILL MORNING BUT SAID THE TROOPER MY ORDERS ARE TO LET THE WASHERWOMAN PASS IN AND OUT AS SHE PLEASES
DOST THOU THEN SEE THE CONSEQUENCE OF ALL THAT WE HAVE SAID NAY WHAT CONSEQUENCE THAT ABSOLUTELY EVERY FORTUNE IS GOOD FORTUNE AND HOW CAN THAT BE SAID I ATTEND SAID SHE SINCE EVERY FORTUNE WELCOME AND UNWELCOME ALIKE HAS FOR ITS OBJECT THE REWARD
ENGULFED HE WEPT THE PITEOUS SIGHT BUT BLINDED SOON AND WILD WITH PAIN IN BITTER TEARS AND SORE ANNOY FOR THAT FOUL FEAST'S UNHOLY JOY GRIM POLYPHEMUS PAID AGAIN HIS LABOURS FOR ALCIDES WIN A NAME OF GLORY FAR AND WIDE
WHAT THEN OF THAT WHICH REMAINS WHICH THOUGH IT IS HARSH PUTS THE RESTRAINT OF JUST PUNISHMENT ON THE BAD DOES POPULAR OPINION DEEM IT GOOD
AS IF NO INTERRUPTION HAD OCCURRED THE RELIEF ARRIVED AT THIS MOMENT THE SENTINEL WHO FELT NETTLED AT THE CONTEMPT OF THE PEDDLER AFTER COMMUNICATING HIS ORDERS WHILE HE WAS RETIRING EXCLAIMED TO HIS SUCCESSOR
YOU MAY KEEP YOURSELF WARM BY DANCING JOHN THE PEDDLER SPY HAS TUNED HIS FIDDLE YOU HEAR AND IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE BETTY WILL STRIKE UP IN HER TURN THE JOKE WAS FOLLOWED BY A GENERAL LAUGH FROM THE PARTY WHO MARCHED ON IN PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTY
IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO BE DISSOLVED IN DELIGHTS OR ENFEEBLED BY PLEASURE YE CLOSE IN CONFLICT YEA IN CONFLICT MOST SHARP WITH ALL FORTUNE'S VICISSITUDES LEST YE SUFFER FOUL FORTUNE TO OVERWHELM OR FAIR FORTUNE TO CORRUPT YOU
GO GO POOR WRETCH AND MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH GOD FOR IT IS HE ONLY THAT CAN BE OF SERVICE TO YOU NOW THE SERGEANT TOOK UP THE LANTERN AND WITH SOME INDIGNATION IN HIS MANNER HE LEFT THE PEDDLER TO SORROWFUL MEDITATIONS ON HIS APPROACHING FATE
WILL RESTRAINS THAT WORK OF REPRODUCTION BY WHICH ALONE THE PERSISTENCE OF PERISHABLE CREATURES IS MAINTAINED SO ENTIRELY DOES THIS LOVE OF SELF COME FROM DRIFT OF NATURE NOT FROM ANIMAL IMPULSE
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF DISAPPOINTED VENGEANCE IN THE FEELINGS OF THE MAN WHO WATCHED THE DOOR OF THE ROOM ON FINDING HIS PRISONER ENJOYING A SLEEP OF WHICH HE HIMSELF WAS DEPRIVED AND AT HIS EXHIBITING SUCH OBVIOUS INDIFFERENCE TO THE UTMOST PENALTY THAT MILITARY RIGOR
FOR MANY OF THE LESSER IMPLEMENTS OF HUSBANDRY THE LAWLESS TIMES HAD HOWEVER OCCASIONED ITS BEING STRIPPED OF EVERYTHING OF VALUE AND THE SEARCHING EYES OF BETTY FLANAGAN SELECTED THIS SPOT ON HER ARRIVAL
WHY YES ALL THAT IS WELL ENOUGH RETURNED THE OTHER BUT JUSTICE SHOULD BE DONE WHILE THERE IS OPPORTUNITY THERE HAVE BEEN STIRRING TIMES IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE THE WAR BEGAN AND MANY HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHTFUL GOODS
WHILE THE EARTH PRESSES DOWNWARD WITH ITS WEIGHT IF IT IS NOT THAT THESE MOTIONS AND SITUATIONS ARE SUITABLE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES MOREOVER EACH SEVERAL THING IS PRESERVED BY THAT WHICH IS AGREEABLE TO ITS NATURE
IN THE GREAT ACCOUNT WHERE A MAN PARADES HIS THOUGHTS FOR THE LAST REVIEW SO THAT HE FINDS THEM FIT TO PASS THE MUSTER OF ANOTHER WORLD I HAVE A SMALL BOOK HERE WHICH I MAKE IT A POINT TO READ A LITTLE IN WHENEVER WE ARE ABOUT TO ENGAGE
AND FALLS TO PIECES IN WHAT WAY WHY TAKE ANIMALS FOR EXAMPLE
AS TO HERBS AND TREES AND INANIMATE THINGS GENERALLY I AM ALTOGETHER IN DOUBT WHAT TO THINK AND YET THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF QUESTION ABOUT THIS EITHER SINCE THOU SEEST HOW HERBS AND TREES GROW IN PLACES SUITABLE FOR THEM
THERE PROBABLY WAS NOT ANOTHER MAN OF HIS RANK IN THE WHOLE PARTY WHO WOULD HAVE DISCOVERED EQUAL BENEVOLENCE TO THE PRISONER OR WHO WOULD NOT HAVE IMITATED THE VETERAN IN REJECTING THE BRIBE ALTHOUGH PROBABLY FROM A LESS WORTHY MOTIVE
CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD REWARDED HIS FIDELITY BY MAKING HIM ITS ORDERLY FOLLOWED BY BIRCH THE SERGEANT PROCEEDED IN SILENCE TO THE DOOR OF THE INTENDED PRISON AND THROWING IT OPEN WITH ONE HAND HE HELD A LANTERN WITH THE OTHER TO LIGHT THE PEDDLER TO HIS PRISON
I PROMISE YOU ON THE WORD OF AN HONEST DRAGOON TO LEND YOU A HELPING HAND TO SEE THEM RIGHTED
HAD COMMITTED THE PEDDLER TRANSFERRED HIS CHARGE TO THE CUSTODY OF THE REGULAR SERGEANT OF THE GUARD THE GIFT OF CAPTAIN WHARTON HAD NOT BEEN LOST ON THE YOUTHFUL LIEUTENANT
WELL IS THERE AUGHT SAID SHE WHICH IN SO FAR AS IT ACTS CONFORMABLY TO NATURE ABANDONS THE WISH FOR LIFE AND DESIRES TO COME TO DEATH AND CORRUPTION
AND A SANCTUARY FOR HER PERSON THE SPARE ARMS AND BAGGAGE OF THE CORPS HAD ALSO BEEN DEPOSITED HERE AND THE UNITED TREASURES WERE PLACED UNDER THE EYE OF THE SENTINEL WHO PARADED THE SHED AS A GUARDIAN OF THE REAR OF THE HEADQUARTERS
HAVE WE NOT SHOWN THAT THOSE THINGS WHICH MOST MEN DESIRE ARE NOT TRUE AND PERFECT GOOD PRECISELY FOR THIS CAUSE THAT THEY DIFFER SEVERALLY ONE FROM ANOTHER AND SEEING THAT ONE IS WANTING TO ANOTHER
AND DRAW OUR BREATH UNCONSCIOUSLY IN SLEEP NAY EVEN IN LIVING CREATURES THE LOVE OF LIFE COMETH NOT OF CONSCIOUS WILL
WHEN THINGS ARE FAR FROM BEING GOOD WHILE THEY ARE DIFFERENT BUT BECOME GOOD AS SOON AS THEY ARE ONE IS IT NOT TRUE THAT THESE BECOME GOOD BY ACQUIRING UNITY IT SEEMS SO SAID I
RELINQUISHING A SMALL BOTTLE THAT THE TROOPER HAD SUCCEEDED IN WRESTING FROM HER BUT I'LL GO TO CAPTAIN JACK AND KNOW IF IT'S ORDERS TO PUT A HANG GALLOWS SPY IN MY ROOM AYE EVEN IN MY WIDOWED BED YOU TIEF
UNTIL THE DRAGOON AT HIS DOOR HEARD HIS LOUD BREATHINGS
AND FROM OFF ONE OF ITS ENDS HAD BEEN PARTITIONED A SMALL APARTMENT
SEATING HIMSELF ON A CASK THAT CONTAINED SOME OF BETTY'S FAVORITE BEVERAGE THE SERGEANT MOTIONED TO BIRCH TO OCCUPY ANOTHER IN THE SAME MANNER THE LANTERN WAS PLACED ON THE FLOOR WHEN THE DRAGOON AFTER LOOKING HIS PRISONER STEADILY IN THE FACE OBSERVED
THE CUNNING PURPOSES OF BASE DECEIT DUO THE OFFICER TO WHOSE KEEPING DUNWOODIE
MUTTERING EXECRATIONS AGAINST THE SERVANTS OF THE OFFICERS WHO BY THEIR WAGGERY HAD DISTURBED HER SLUMBERS BEFORE THE FIRE THE SENTINEL UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH OF HER MALEDICTIONS TO COMPREHEND THE CASE
OBSERVE THEN IF IN FOLLOWING POPULAR OPINION WE HAVE NOT ENDED IN A CONCLUSION QUITE PARADOXICAL HOW SO SAID I
BUT DOST NOT THOU ALLOW THAT ALL WHICH IS GOOD IS GOOD BY PARTICIPATION IN GOODNESS IT IS THEN THOU MUST ON SIMILAR GROUNDS ADMIT THAT UNITY AND GOODNESS ARE THE SAME
EXCEEDINGLY DO I REJOICE DEAR PUPIL THINE EYE IS NOW FIXED ON THE VERY CENTRAL MARK OF TRUTH MOREOVER HEREIN IS REVEALED THAT OF WHICH THOU DIDST ERSTWHILE PROFESS THYSELF IGNORANT WHAT IS THAT SAID I
OF AN INTELLIGENT SOUL BUT OF THE DRIFT OF NATURE
A MAN HUNG UP LIKE A DOG THEN YOU MIGHT SAVE ME FROM THIS IGNOMINIOUS DEATH SAID BIRCH SPRINGING TO HIS FEET AND CATCHING THE DRAGOON BY THE ARM AND OH WHAT WILL I NOT GIVE YOU IN REWARD
WHO FROM FALSE WAYS HIS HEEDFUL STEPS WOULD KEEP BY INWARD LIGHT MUST SEARCH WITHIN IN MEDITATION DEEP ALL OUTWARD BENT HE MUST REPRESS HIS SOUL'S TRUE TREASURE TO POSSESS
SURELY IT IS THAT WHICH IS DESIRED OF ALL AND SINCE WE HAVE CONCLUDED THE GOOD TO BE SUCH WE OUGHT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE END AND AIM OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE TO BE THE GOOD
AND HE SUFFERED HER TO ENTER HER ROOM WITHOUT EXPLAINING THAT IT CONTAINED ANOTHER INMATE THE NOISE OF HER HUGE FRAME FALLING ON THE BED WAS SUCCEEDED
THIS IS WE SAY A LIVING CREATURE BUT WHEN THIS UNITY IS BROKEN BY THE SEPARATION OF THESE TWO THE CREATURE DIES AND IS CLEARLY NO LONGER LIVING
THE MAN CONTINUED WALKING HIS POST MUSING ON AN INDIFFERENCE TO LIFE WHICH COULD ALLOW NATURE ITS CUSTOMARY REST EVEN ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE GRAVE HARVEY BIRCH HAD HOWEVER BEEN A NAME TOO LONG HELD IN DETESTATION BY EVERY MAN IN THE CORPS
THAT THIS SOLITARY LIFE IS EXTREMELY IRKSOME ALL THESE EXPRESSIONS AND PARTICULARLY THE LAST GREATLY INCREASED MY LOVE FOR HIM PRINCE SAID I THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT PROVIDENCE HAS BROUGHT ME INTO YOUR PORT TO AFFORD YOU AN OPPORTUNITY
TOLD ME THEY INTENDED TO MARRY AGAIN I OBSERVED THAT IF PUTTING ME TO EXPENSE WAS THE ONLY REASON THEY MIGHT LAY THOSE THOUGHTS ASIDE AND BE WELCOME TO REMAIN FOR WHAT I HAD WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN US ALL THREE
WHO SO ATTAINS THE END OF HIS DESIRES THAT NOTHING FURTHER TO BE DESIRED LIES BEYOND WHENCE FOLLOWS THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THEY WHO ARE WICKED ARE SEEN LIKEWISE TO BE WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH FOR WHY DO THEY FORSAKE VIRTUE AND FOLLOW VICE
BUT WHICH THEY CANNOT WIN OR HOLD NAY THEIR FAILURE CONCERNS THE VERY SUM AND CROWN OF THINGS POOR WRETCHES THEY FAIL TO COMPASS EVEN THAT FOR WHICH THEY TOIL DAY AND NIGHT
THE ABSENCE OF THE OTHER ADMITTED BUT A MAN LACKS THAT OF WHICH HE IS IN WANT HE DOES
THE ABILITY TO COMMIT CRIME CANNOT BE REFERRED TO THE GOOD THEREFORE IT IS NOT A THING TO BE DESIRED AND YET ALL POWER IS DESIRABLE IT IS CLEAR THEN THAT ABILITY TO DO EVIL IS NOT POWER
I STOOD SOME TIME ADMIRING THE RICHES AND MAGNIFICENCE OF THE ROOM BUT ABOVE ALL
AND LIFTING UP MY HEAD SAW A DIAMOND AS LARGE AS THE EGG OF AN OSTRICH LYING UPON A LOW STOOL IT WAS SO PURE THAT I COULD NOT FIND THE LEAST BLEMISH IN IT AND IT SPARKLED WITH SO MUCH BRILLIANCY
THE SHIP I CAME IN MAY SERVE IN SOME MEASURE TO CONVINCE YOU
OF COURSE NOT THEN IN RESPECT OF WHAT HE CAN ACCOMPLISH A MAN IS TO BE RECKONED STRONG IN RESPECT OF WHAT HE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WEAK GRANTED SAID I THEN DOST THOU REMEMBER THAT BY OUR FORMER REASONINGS
FOR SINCE GOOD AND EVIL ARE CONTRARIES IF IT IS MADE PLAIN THAT GOOD IS POWER THE FEEBLENESS OF EVIL IS CLEARLY SEEN AND CONVERSELY IF THE FRAIL NATURE OF EVIL IS MADE MANIFEST THE STRENGTH OF GOOD IS THEREBY KNOWN
AND AT LAST CAME INTO A LARGE ROOM WHERE THERE WAS A THRONE OF MASSIVE GOLD
THE RICH HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO SATE THEIR HUNGER THE MEANS TO GET RID OF THIRST AND COLD TRUE ENOUGH WANT CAN THUS BE SOOTHED BY RICHES WHOLLY REMOVED IT CANNOT BE
HER HUSBAND HAD TREATED HER AFTER THE SAME MANNER AND I RECEIVED HER LIKEWISE WITH THE SAME AFFECTION AS I HAD DONE THE FORMER SOME TIME AFTER MY TWO SISTERS
ON THAT SIDE FROM WHENCE THE SOUND PROCEEDED I CAME TO THE CLOSET DOOR AND STOOD STILL NOT DOUBTING THAT IT CAME FROM THENCE I SET DOWN MY TORCH UPON THE GROUND
IN A MANNER ANSWERABLE TO OUR CONDITION BUT I ADDED I RATHER BELIEVE YOU WISH TO MARRY AGAIN I SHALL FEEL MUCH SURPRISED IF SUCH BE THE CASE AFTER THE EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE HAD OF THE LITTLE SATISFACTION THERE IS IN WEDLOCK
WHEREAS IF THERE BE NO POWER THE WILL IS ALL IN VAIN AND SO IF THOU SEEST ANY MAN WISHING TO ATTAIN SOME END YET UTTERLY FAILING TO ATTAIN IT THOU CANST NOT DOUBT THAT HE LACKED THE POWER OF GETTING WHAT HE WISHED FOR
WHICH WAS INESTIMABLE IN VALUE WERE IT ONLY FOR THE DIAMOND I MENTIONED THE DOORS BEING ALL OPEN OR BUT HALF SHUT I SURVEYED SOME OTHER APARTMENTS THAT WERE AS BEAUTIFUL AS THOSE I HAD ALREADY SEEN
THE DOOR BEING ONLY HALF SHUT I OPENED IT WENT IN AND STANDING UPRIGHT BEFORE THE NICHE I REPEATED THIS PRAYER ALOUD PRAISE BE TO GOD WHO HAS FAVOURED US WITH A HAPPY VOYAGE
THE BAD HAVE AN ABILITY NOR DO I WISH TO DENY IT ONLY THIS ABILITY OF THEIRS COMES NOT FROM STRENGTH BUT FROM IMPOTENCE FOR THEIR ABILITY IS TO DO EVIL
AS SOON AS I WAS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING IT SHE EXPLAINED TO ME ALL THE PASSAGES OF THIS EXCELLENT BOOK AND INFUSED PIETY INTO MY MIND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER OR ANY OTHER PERSON SHE HAPPENED TO DIE
THE IMPORTANT SERVICES YOU HAVE RENDERED ME THAN BY WHAT I HAVE JUST DONE THE TREACHERY OF YOUR SISTERS WAS WELL KNOWN TO ME AND TO AVENGE YOUR WRONGS AS SOON AS I WAS LIBERATED BY YOUR GENEROUS ASSISTANCE
AS SOON AS THESE TWO SISTERS RECEIVED THEIR PORTIONS THEY LEFT ME TO LIVE WITH THEIR MOTHER MY OTHER TWO SISTERS AND MYSELF STAYED WITH OUR MOTHER WHO WAS THEN ALIVE AND WHO WHEN SHE AFTERWARDS DIED
I ENTERED THE TOWN AND PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL STREETS WHERE AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS STOOD MEN IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES BUT ALL MOTIONLESS AND PETRIFIED IN THE QUARTER INHABITED BY THE MERCHANTS
CANNOT MAKE ITS POSSESSOR INDEPENDENT AND FREE FROM ALL WANT YET THIS WAS WHAT IT SEEMED TO PROMISE MOREOVER I THINK THIS ALSO WELL DESERVES TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE SPECIAL NATURE OF MONEY
WERE MAGI WORSHIPPERS OF FIRE AND OF NARDOUN THE ANCIENT KING OF THE GIANTS WHO REBELLED AGAINST GOD BUT THOUGH I WAS BORN OF AN IDOLATROUS FATHER AND MOTHER I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE IN MY YOUTH TO HAVE A GOVERNESS
AND THEY HAD ALL SUCH DREADFUL COUNTENANCES THAT I WAS GREATLY ALARMED BUT PERCEIVING THEY REMAINED STATIONARY AND DID NOT SO MUCH AS MOVE THEIR EYES I TOOK COURAGE AND WENT NEARER WHEN I FOUND THEY WERE ALL TURNED INTO STONES
AND I DARE ENGAGE TO PROMISE YOU SANCTUARY THERE UNTIL THE MIGHTY COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL
THAT WE SHOULD ASSERT THAT THE BAD WHO FORM THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND DO NOT EXIST BUT THE FACT IS SO I DO NOT INDEED DENY THAT THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE BAD BUT THAT THEY ARE IN AN UNQUALIFIED AND ABSOLUTE SENSE I DENY
WILL GIVE YOU FULL INFORMATION IN THE RELATION OF HER STORY AFTER THE CALIPH HAD HEARD ZOBEIDE WITH MUCH ASTONISHMENT
THE WISE ALONE ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY WOULD WHILE THE WICKED FOLLOW THEIR OWN HEARTS LUST BUT CAN NOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY WOULD FOR THEY GO ON IN THEIR WILFULNESS
READING WITH GREAT DEVOTION THE KORAUN WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM ON A DESK AT THIS SIGHT I WAS TRANSPORTED WITH ADMIRATION I WONDERED HOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT HE SHOULD BE THE ONLY LIVING CREATURE
AS WE WERE ONE DAY CONVERSING ABOUT OUR THIRD SISTER AND WONDERING WE RECEIVED NO INTELLIGENCE OF HER
BRING WITH THEM ANYTHING OF SUCH SORT AS SEEMS TO HAVE NOTHING WANTING TO IT THAT IS GOOD WE TOO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME ARE MADE HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF THESE THINGS BUT IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FULFIL THEIR PROMISES AND MOREOVER
FOR IF THIS EVER GAPING EVER CRAVING WANT IS GLUTTED BY WEALTH IT NEEDS MUST BE THAT THE WANT ITSELF WHICH CAN BE SO GLUTTED STILL REMAINS I DO NOT SPEAK OF HOW VERY LITTLE SUFFICES FOR NATURE
THE WORDS WERE THESE INHABITANTS ABANDON THE WORSHIP OF NARDOUN AND OF FIRE AND WORSHIP THE ONLY GOD WHO SHEWS MERCY THIS VOICE WAS HEARD THREE YEARS SUCCESSIVELY BUT NO ONE WAS CONVERTED
AFTER I HAD PRESENTED MY SISTERS TO THE PRINCE I TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HINDERED MY RETURN THE DAY BEFORE HOW I HAD MET WITH THE YOUNG PRINCE HIS STORY AND THE CAUSE OF THE DESOLATION OF SO FINE A CITY
IS IT FROM IGNORANCE OF WHAT IS GOOD WELL WHAT IS MORE WEAK AND FEEBLE THAN THE BLINDNESS OF IGNORANCE DO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY OUGHT TO FOLLOW BUT LUST DRIVES THEM ASIDE OUT OF THE WAY IF IT BE SO THEY ARE STILL FRAIL BY REASON OF THEIR INCONTINENCE
AND WHY I ALONE AM SAFE IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A TERRIBLE DISASTER I TOLD HIM IN A FEW WORDS WHENCE I HAD COME WHAT HAD MADE ME UNDERTAKE THE VOYAGE AND HOW I SAFELY ARRIVED AT THE PORT AFTER TWENTY DAYS SAILING
YOU MUST KNOW THAT THIS CITY WAS THE METROPOLIS OF A MIGHTY KINGDOM OVER WHICH THE SULTAN MY FATHER REIGNED THAT PRINCE HIS WHOLE COURT THE INHABITANTS OF THE CITY AND ALL HIS OTHER SUBJECTS
HOWEVER IT MADE ME IMAGINE THAT THERE WAS SOME LIVING CREATURE IN THIS PLACE FOR I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TORCHES CONTINUED THUS BURNING OF THEMSELVES SEVERAL OTHER RARITIES DETAINED MY CURIOSITY IN THIS ROOM
I RECEIVED HER WITH EVERY POSSIBLE TENDERNESS AND INQUIRING INTO THE CAUSE OF HER DISTRESS SHE TOLD ME WITH TEARS HOW INHUMANLY HER HUSBAND HAD BEHAVED TOWARDS HER HER MISFORTUNES AFFECTED ME AND I MINGLED MY TEARS WITH HERS
TO GET ABOARD MY SHIP I LAID MYSELF DOWN UPON A COUCH NOT WITHOUT SOME DREAD TO BE ALONE IN A DESOLATE PLACE AND THIS FEAR HINDERED MY SLEEP ABOUT MIDNIGHT
AND IN THIS YOUR MAJESTY MAY SEE I AM MORE TO BE PITIED THAN BLAMED IF THERE BE ANY THING ELSE RELATING TO MYSELF
I LOST MYSELF AMONG THE APARTMENTS AND PERCEIVING I WAS COME BACK AGAIN TO THE LARGE ROOM WHERE THE THRONE THE COUCH THE LARGE DIAMOND AND THE TORCHES STOOD I RESOLVED TO TAKE MY NIGHT'S LODGING THERE AND TO DEPART THE NEXT MORNING EARLY
I HAVE NOT ALTERED MY MIND WITH RESPECT TO YOU SINCE WE LAST PARTED COME AGAIN AND TAKE PART OF WHAT I HAVE UPON THIS I EMBRACED THEM AND WE LIVED TOGETHER AS BEFORE
BUT ABUNDANTLY MORE WISE THAN WE IF YOU WILL VOUCHSAFE TO RECEIVE US ONCE MORE INTO YOUR HOUSE AND ACCOUNT US YOUR SLAVES WE SHALL NEVER COMMIT A SIMILAR FAULT AGAIN MY ANSWER WAS DEAR SISTERS
AT LAST WE SET SAIL WITH A WIND AS FAVOURABLE AS WE COULD WISH THE YOUNG PRINCE MY SISTERS AND MYSELF ENJOYED OURSELVES FOR SOME TIME VERY AGREEABLY BUT ALAS THIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING DID NOT LAST LONG
AND THE EMPLOYMENT I FOLLOW OF BREEDING SILK WORMS ASSURE YOURSELF THERE IS NOTHING I HAVE BUT IS AT YOUR SERVICE AND AS MUCH AT YOUR DISPOSAL AS MY OWN WE LIVED VERY COMFORTABLY TOGETHER FOR SOME MONTHS
AND UPON THE THRONE THERE WAS A BED OF RICH STUFF EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS WHAT SURPRISED ME MOST WAS A SPARKLING LIGHT WHICH CAME FROM ABOVE THE BED BEING CURIOUS TO KNOW WHENCE IT PROCEEDED I ASCENDED THE STEPS
CAN WANT BE DRIVEN AWAY BY RICHES CANNOT THE RICH FEEL HUNGER CANNOT THEY THIRST ARE NOT THE LIMBS OF THE WEALTHY SENSITIVE TO THE WINTER'S COLD BUT THOU WILT SAY
YET IN SOME WISE NOTWITHSTANDING YE DISCERN THE TRUE END OF HAPPINESS AND SO THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS YOU THITHER TO THAT TRUE GOOD WHILE ERROR IN MANY FORMS LEADS YOU ASTRAY THEREFROM
AND ASKED HER WHO SHE WAS I AM SAID SHE THE SERPENT WHOM YOU LATELY DELIVERED FROM MY MORTAL ENEMY
HOWEVER TO WIN AMPLER CREDENCE FOR MY CONCLUSION I WILL PURSUE BOTH PATHS AND DRAW CONFIRMATION FOR MY STATEMENTS FIRST IN ONE WAY AND THEN IN THE OTHER THE CARRYING OUT OF ANY HUMAN ACTION DEPENDS UPON TWO THINGS
WAS THY MIND NEVER TROUBLED IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME WRONG DONE TO THEE NAY SAID I
AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH WE PERCEIVED A GREAT TOWN HAVING A FRESH GALE WE SOON REACHED THE HARBOUR AND CAST ANCHOR I HAD NOT PATIENCE TO WAIT TILL MY SISTERS WERE DRESSED TO GO ALONG WITH ME BUT WENT ASHORE ALONE IN THE BOAT
FOR IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED SEVERAL VESSELS MORE TO CONVEY TO BAGDAD
SORROW HIS SPIRIT VEXES SORE AND EMPTY HOPES DELUDE
AFTER WE HAD LADEN THE VESSEL WITH WHAT WE THOUGHT MOST DESIRABLE WE TOOK SUCH PROVISIONS AND WATER ABOARD AS WERE NECESSARY FOR OUR VOYAGE
HE APPEARED CHANGED AS IF HE HAD SUDDENLY MATURED ONE COULDN'T BE SURE HE MUTTERED AH YOU WERE NOT SURE I SAID
HADN'T WE ALL COMMENCED WITH THE SAME DESIRE ENDED WITH THE SAME KNOWLEDGE CARRIED THE MEMORY OF THE SAME CHERISHED GLAMOUR THROUGH THE SORDID DAYS OF IMPRECATION WHAT WONDER THAT WHEN SOME
AFFLICTED BY SOME MYSTERIOUS TROPICAL DISEASE WHO HELD THE DOCTOR FOR AN ASS AND INDULGED IN SECRET DEBAUCHERIES OF PATENT MEDICINE WHICH HIS TAMIL SERVANT USED TO SMUGGLE IN WITH UNWEARIED DEVOTION THEY TOLD EACH OTHER THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES
I KNEW THERE WAS NO OTHER BULKHEAD IN THE SHIP BUT THE COLLISION BULKHEAD SEPARATING THE FOREPEAK FROM THE FOREHOLD I WENT BACK TO TELL THE CAPTAIN I CAME UPON THE SECOND ENGINEER GETTING UP AT THE FOOT OF THE BRIDGE LADDER HE SEEMED DAZED AND
WITHOUT A RIPPLE WITHOUT A WRINKLE VISCOUS STAGNANT DEAD THE PATNA WITH A SLIGHT HISS PASSED OVER THAT PLAIN LUMINOUS AND SMOOTH UNROLLED A BLACK RIBBON OF SMOKE ACROSS THE SKY
DISABLED BY A FALLING SPAR AT THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK OF WHICH HIS SCOTTISH CAPTAIN USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS MAN IT'S A PAIRFECT MEERACLE TO ME HOW SHE LIVED THROUGH IT SPENT MANY DAYS STRETCHED ON HIS BACK DAZED BATTERED HOPELESS
HIS LAMENESS HOWEVER PERSISTED AND WHEN THE SHIP ARRIVED AT AN EASTERN PORT HE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL HIS RECOVERY WAS SLOW AND HE WAS LEFT BEHIND
AND TORMENTED AS IF AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS OF UNREST HE DID NOT CARE WHAT THE END WOULD BE AND IN HIS LUCID MOMENTS OVERVALUED HIS INDIFFERENCE THE DANGER WHEN NOT SEEN HAS THE IMPERFECT VAGUENESS OF HUMAN THOUGHT
HE KNEW THE MAGIC MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE BETWEEN SKY AND WATER HE HAD TO BEAR THE CRITICISM OF MEN THE EXACTIONS OF THE SEA AND THE PROSAIC SEVERITY OF THE DAILY TASK THAT GIVES BREAD BUT WHOSE ONLY REWARD IS IN THE PERFECT LOVE OF THE WORK
I WANTED IT IT IS THE VERY THING I WANTED THERE DO YOU THINK YOU OR ANYBODY COULD HAVE MADE ME IF I I AM I AM NOT AFRAID TO TELL AND I WASN'T AFRAID TO THINK EITHER I LOOKED IT IN THE FACE
THE MISTS WERE CLOSING AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD I APPEARED TO HIM AND HOW MUCH WISE NOT HALF AS OLD AS I FELT JUST THEN NOT HALF AS USELESSLY WISE AS I KNEW MYSELF TO BE
THE STRONG MEN AT THE HEAD OF FAMILY PARTIES THE LEAN OLD MEN PRESSING FORWARD WITHOUT HOPE OF RETURN YOUNG BOYS WITH FEARLESS EYES GLANCING CURIOUSLY SHY LITTLE GIRLS WITH TUMBLED LONG HAIR
HE REPEATED AND I WONDERED AT THE EVIDENT BUT OBSCURE INTENTION WELL YES PERHAPS I COULD NOT SEE THEN BUT I HAD PLENTY OF TIME AND ANY AMOUNT OF LIGHT IN THAT BOAT AND I COULD THINK TOO
OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO IMAGINE YOURSELF TO HAVE BEEN OF THE SORT WHOSE APPEARANCE CLAIMS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THESE ILLUSIONS YOU HAD THOUGHT GONE OUT EXTINCT COLD AND WHICH AS IF REKINDLED AT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER FLAME
HIS VOICE SOUNDED REASONABLE SUPPOSE I HAD NOT I MEAN TO SAY SUPPOSE I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP WELL HOW MUCH LONGER SAY A MINUTE HALF A MINUTE
NO THE PROPER THING WAS TO FACE IT OUT ALONE FOR MYSELF WAIT FOR ANOTHER CHANCE
OVERSHADOWED BY A FRAGMENT OF AN UNRUFFLED FOREHEAD AND WITH THE VERY FIRST WORD UTTERED MARLOW'S BODY EXTENDED AT REST IN THE SEAT WOULD BECOME VERY STILL AS THOUGH HIS SPIRIT HAD WINGED ITS WAY BACK INTO THE LAPSE OF TIME
TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HIS LEFT ARM WAS BROKEN HE HAD SLIPPED ON THE TOP STEP WHEN GETTING DOWN WHILE I WAS FORWARD HE EXCLAIMED MY GOD THAT ROTTEN BULKHEAD'LL GIVE WAY IN A MINUTE
AND YET A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT SEEMED TO SHOW ME HIS BOYISH HEAD AS IF IN THAT MOMENT THE YOUTH WITHIN HIM HAD FOR A MOMENT GLOWED AND EXPIRED YOU ARE AN AWFUL GOOD SORT TO LISTEN
I WASN'T GOING TO RUN AWAY AT FIRST AT NIGHT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THOSE FELLOWS I MIGHT HAVE NO BY HEAVENS I WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM THAT SATISFACTION THEY HAD DONE ENOUGH THEY MADE UP A STORY AND BELIEVED IT FOR ALL I KNOW
HE RESTED HIS TEMPLE IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THE WIND OF THE PUNKAHS EDDIED DOWN ON THE HEADS ON THE DARK FACED NATIVES WOUND ABOUT IN VOLUMINOUS DRAPERIES ON THE EUROPEANS SITTING TOGETHER VERY HOT
SUCH WERE THE DAYS STILL HOT HEAVY DISAPPEARING ONE BY ONE INTO THE PAST AS IF FALLING INTO AN ABYSS FOR EVER OPEN IN THE WAKE OF THE SHIP AND THE SHIP LONELY UNDER A WISP OF SMOKE
HARBOURED A SILENT LISTENER NOW AND THEN A SMALL RED GLOW WOULD MOVE ABRUPTLY AND EXPANDING LIGHT UP THE FINGERS OF A LANGUID HAND PART OF A FACE IN PROFOUND REPOSE OR FLASH A CRIMSON GLEAM INTO A PAIR OF PENSIVE EYES
PERDITION THAT DWELT WITHIN LIKE A MALEVOLENT SOUL IN A DETESTABLE BODY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE THIS CLEAR THIS HAD NOT BEEN A COMMON AFFAIR EVERYTHING IN IT HAD BEEN OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
FELT A SHIVER RUN DOWN HIS BACK THE BIG ASSESSOR HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS AND DRUMMED ON WITHOUT A SOUND CARELESS AND MOURNFUL THE EYES OF THE OTHER ABOVE THE SUNBURNT CLASPED FINGERS
ITS EYE OF FLAME AS IF IN DERISION OF HER ERRAND OF FAITH SHE CLEARED THE STRAIT CROSSED THE BAY CONTINUED ON HER WAY THROUGH THE ONE DEGREE PASSAGE SHE HELD ON STRAIGHT FOR THE RED SEA UNDER A SERENE SKY
AND WAS PLACATED BY THE SOUND OF A FAINT SIGH THAT PASSED BETWEEN US LIKE THE FLIGHT OF A BIRD IN THE NIGHT WELL I WASN'T HE SAID COURAGEOUSLY IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRETCHED STORY THEY MADE UP IT WAS NOT A LIE
A LITTLE VICIOUSLY I FEAR DON'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CRAFT I WAS AGGRIEVED AGAINST HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CHEATED ME
COMING FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AND FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE EAST AFTER TREADING THE JUNGLE PATHS DESCENDING THE RIVERS COASTING IN PRAUS ALONG THE SHALLOWS CROSSING IN SMALL CANOES FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND PASSING THROUGH SUFFERING
HIS FINGERS PLAYED INCESSANTLY TOUCHING THE PAPER WITHOUT NOISE I DID NOT THINK OF DANGER JUST THEN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE STARTLED ALL THIS HAPPENED IN SUCH A QUIET WAY AND SO VERY SUDDENLY
AND ON THE SECRET PURPOSES OF THEIR HEARTS THE STEAMER POUNDED IN THE DUSK THE CALM WATER OF THE STRAIT AND FAR ASTERN OF THE PILGRIM SHIP A SCREW PILE LIGHTHOUSE PLANTED BY UNBELIEVERS ON A TREACHEROUS SHOAL SEEMED TO WINK AT HER
BUT IT WASN'T TRUTH ALL THE SAME IT WAS SOMETHING ONE KNOWS A DOWNRIGHT LIE THERE WAS NOT THE THICKNESS OF A SHEET OF PAPER BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF THIS AFFAIR
GLITTER OF THE VAST SURFACE WHICH IS ONLY A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN GLANCES FULL OF FIRE THERE IS SUCH MAGNIFICENT VAGUENESS IN THE EXPECTATIONS THAT HAD DRIVEN EACH OF US TO SEA SUCH A GLORIOUS INDEFINITENESS
NOBODY WOULD KNOW OF COURSE BUT THIS DID NOT MAKE IT ANY EASIER FOR ME YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT TOO I DID NOT WANT ALL THIS TALK NO YES I WON'T LIE
LIKE WATER FLOWING INTO CREVICES AND CRANNIES LIKE WATER RISING SILENTLY EVEN WITH THE RIM EIGHT HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN WITH FAITH AND HOPES WITH AFFECTIONS AND MEMORIES THEY HAD COLLECTED THERE
AND HE HAD BEEN DELIBERATING UPON DEATH CONFOUND HIM HE HAD FOUND THAT TO MEDITATE ABOUT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE WHILE ALL ITS GLAMOUR HAD GONE WITH THE SHIP IN THE NIGHT WHAT MORE NATURAL
AND THEN THE UNINTELLIGENT BRUTALITY OF AN EXISTENCE LIABLE TO THE AGONY OF SUCH SENSATIONS FILLED HIM WITH A DESPAIRING DESIRE TO ESCAPE AT ANY COST THEN FINE WEATHER RETURNED AND HE THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT
AND IN DRILL SUITS THAT SEEMED TO FIT THEM AS CLOSE AS THEIR SKINS AND HOLDING THEIR ROUND PITH HATS ON THEIR KNEES WHILE GLIDING ALONG THE WALLS THE COURT PEONS BUTTONED TIGHT IN LONG WHITE COATS FLITTED RAPIDLY TO AND FRO
AT HIS BACK WAS THE DARK NIGHT WITH THE CLEAR STARS WHOSE DISTANT GLITTER DISPOSED IN RETREATING PLANES LURED THE EYE INTO THE DEPTHS OF A GREATER DARKNESS
KEEP UP THE ILLUSION OF MY BEGINNINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD ROBBED OUR COMMON LIFE OF THE LAST SPARK OF ITS GLAMOUR AND SO YOU CLEARED OUT AT ONCE JUMPED HE CORRECTED ME INCISIVELY JUMPED MIND
AND AUDIBLY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AFTER DINNER ON A VERANDAH DRAPED IN MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS IN THE DEEP DUSK SPECKLED BY FIERY CIGAR ENDS THE ELONGATED BULK OF EACH CANE CHAIR
I WAS TOLD TO CALL NO ONE AND TO MAKE NO NOISE FOR FEAR OF CREATING A PANIC I THOUGHT THE PRECAUTION REASONABLE I TOOK ONE OF THE LAMPS THAT WERE HUNG UNDER THE AWNINGS AND WENT FORWARD AFTER OPENING THE FOREPEAK HATCH I HEARD SPLASHING IN THERE
BROUGHT INTO THE BARE ROOM THE SOFTNESS OF THE SKY THE LANGUOR OF THE EARTH THE BEWITCHING BREATH OF THE EASTERN WATERS THERE WERE PERFUMES IN IT SUGGESTIONS OF INFINITE REPOSE THE GIFT OF ENDLESS DREAMS
THE SOUND OF HIS OWN TRUTHFUL STATEMENTS CONFIRMED HIS DELIBERATE OPINION THAT SPEECH WAS OF NO USE TO HIM ANY LONGER THAT MAN THERE SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF HIS HOPELESS DIFFICULTY JIM LOOKED AT HIM THEN TURNED AWAY
CHAPTER TWO AFTER TWO YEARS OF TRAINING HE WENT TO SEA AND ENTERING THE REGIONS SO WELL KNOWN TO HIS IMAGINATION FOUND THEM STRANGELY BARREN OF ADVENTURE HE MADE MANY VOYAGES
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR A FELLOW IN MY POSITION TO BE BELIEVED MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO AN ELDER MAN IT IS SO DIFFICULT SO AWFULLY UNFAIR SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
IN THEIR APPEARANCE OF DOING SO WELL ON SUCH A SMALL ALLOWANCE OF DANGER AND TOIL IN TIME BESIDE THE ORIGINAL DISDAIN THERE GREW UP SLOWLY ANOTHER SENTIMENT AND SUDDENLY GIVING UP THE IDEA OF GOING HOME
MEETING STRANGE SIGHTS BESET BY STRANGE FEARS UPHELD BY ONE DESIRE THEY CAME FROM SOLITARY HUTS IN THE WILDERNESS FROM POPULOUS CAMPONGS FROM VILLAGES BY THE SEA AT THE CALL OF AN IDEA
LOOKING AT JIM WITH THOUGHTFUL BLUE EYES THE OTHER A HEAVY SCORNFUL MAN THROWN BACK IN HIS SEAT HIS LEFT ARM EXTENDED FULL LENGTH DRUMMED DELICATELY WITH HIS FINGER TIPS ON A BLOTTING PAD IN THE MIDDLE THE MAGISTRATE
HAD PRESERVED AN UNDEFACED ENERGY WITH THE TEMPER OF BUCCANEERS AND THE EYES OF DREAMERS THEY APPEARED TO LIVE IN A CRAZY MAZE OF PLANS HOPES DANGERS ENTERPRISES AHEAD OF CIVILISATION IN THE DARK PLACES OF THE SEA
AND THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY WAS BEING HELD IN THE POLICE COURT OF AN EASTERN PORT HE STOOD ELEVATED IN THE WITNESS BOX WITH BURNING CHEEKS IN A COOL LOFTY ROOM
SURELY IN NO OTHER CRAFT AS IN THAT OF THE SEA DO THE HEARTS OF THOSE ALREADY LAUNCHED TO SINK OR SWIM GO OUT SO MUCH TO THE YOUTH ON THE BRINK LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES UPON THAT
GLIDED PAST ON HIS DESCENT AND SANK MYSTERIOUSLY INTO THE SEA EVENING AFTER EVENING PRESERVING THE SAME DISTANCE AHEAD OF HER ADVANCING BOWS THE FIVE WHITES ON BOARD LIVED AMIDSHIPS ISOLATED FROM THE HUMAN CARGO
WE STARED AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT I WAS ABOUT TO WITNESS A STRANGE SCENE OBSERVING THE SEAFLOOR I SAW THAT IT SWELLED AT CERTAIN POINTS FROM LOW BULGES THAT WERE ENCRUSTED WITH LIMESTONE DEPOSITS
HE IS WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS YOU STAY WITH HIM THEREFORE FOR THE NIGHT
BY EIGHT THIRTY WE WERE SUITED UP FOR THIS NEW STROLL AND EQUIPPED WITH OUR TWO DEVICES FOR LIGHTING AND BREATHING THE DOUBLE DOOR OPENED
THEN HE SAID GO ON BOARD AT ONCE AND TELL YOUR MEN TO DO SO ALSO BEFORE I CAN REACH HOME TO TELL MY FATHER I KNOW HOW OBSTINATE HE IS AND AM SURE HE WILL NOT LET YOU GO
CAPTAIN NEMO ARMS CROSSED OVER HIS CHEST KNELT IN A POSTURE OF PRAYER AS DID ALL THE FRIENDS OF HIM WHO HAD LOVED THEM MY TWO COMPANIONS AND I BOWED REVERENTLY
BUT TELEMACHUS COULD GET NO REST ALL NIGHT FOR THINKING OF HIS UNHAPPY FATHER SO MINERVA WENT CLOSE UP TO HIM AND SAID TELEMACHUS YOU SHOULD NOT REMAIN SO FAR AWAY FROM HOME ANY LONGER NOR LEAVE YOUR PROPERTY WITH SUCH DANGEROUS PEOPLE IN YOUR HOUSE
I RESUMED MY WORK HOPING HE MIGHT GIVE ME SOME EXPLANATION OF THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON'S EVENTS HE DID NOTHING OF THE SORT I STARED AT HIM HIS FACE LOOKED EXHAUSTED HIS REDDENED EYES HADN'T BEEN REFRESHED BY SLEEP
BUT HERE IT WAS NO LONGER SOME ISOLATED BUSH OR A MODEST GROVE OF LOW TIMBER IT WAS AN IMMENSE FOREST HUGE MINERAL VEGETATION ENORMOUS PETRIFIED TREES LINKED BY GARLANDS OF ELEGANT HYDRAS FROM THE GENUS PLUMULARIA
AND DISHEVELED BY THE WIND LONG BILLOWS MADE THE SUBMERSIBLE ROLL VERY NOTICEABLY AFTER RENEWING ITS AIR THE NAUTILUS STAYED AT AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF FIFTEEN METERS ENABLING IT TO RETURN QUICKLY TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
HE HADN'T COME INTO THE PICTURE I REJOINED NED LAND AND CONSEIL I INFORMED THEM OF CAPTAIN NEMO'S PROPOSITION CONSEIL WAS EAGER TO ACCEPT AND THIS TIME THE CANADIAN PROVED PERFECTLY AMENABLE TO GOING WITH US IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
FISH FLED HERE AND THERE AS THEIR RETREAT WAS DISTURBED I HEARD THE PICK RINGING ON THE LIMESTONE SOIL ITS IRON TIP SOMETIMES GIVING OFF SPARKS WHEN IT HIT A STRAY PIECE OF FLINT ON THE SEA BOTTOM THE HOLE GREW LONGER WIDER AND SOON
AND TURNING AROUND I SAW THE CREWMEN FORM A SEMICIRCLE AROUND THEIR LEADER LOOKING WITH GREATER CARE I OBSERVED THAT FOUR OF THEM WERE CARRYING ON THEIR SHOULDERS AN OBJECT THAT WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE
AS HE WAS THUS SPEAKING A BIRD FLEW ON HIS RIGHT HAND AN EAGLE WITH A GREAT WHITE GOOSE IN ITS TALONS WHICH IT HAD CARRIED OFF FROM THE FARM YARD AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN WERE RUNNING AFTER IT AND SHOUTING
WHEN HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE TREASURES OF HIS HOUSE WERE KEPT HE SELECTED A DOUBLE CUP
NO MY MIND WAS REELING AS NEVER BEFORE NEVER HAD IDEAS OF SUCH IMPACT RACED THROUGH MY BRAIN I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE WHAT MY EYES SAW MEANWHILE THE GRAVE DIGGING WENT SLOWLY
IF YOU INSIST ON GOING I WILL NOT DETAIN YOU I DO NOT LIKE TO SEE A HOST EITHER TOO FOND OF HIS GUEST OR TOO RUDE TO HIM MODERATION IS BEST IN ALL THINGS AND NOT LETTING A MAN GO WHEN HE WANTS TO DO SO IS AS BAD AS TELLING HIM TO GO IF HE WOULD LIKE TO STAY
BUT TELEMACHUS CALLED THE MEN TOGETHER AND GAVE HIS ORDERS NOW MY MEN SAID HE GET EVERYTHING IN ORDER ON BOARD THE SHIP AND LET US SET OUT HOME THUS DID HE SPEAK AND THEY WENT ON BOARD EVEN AS HE HAD SAID
AND TRAVELLED THE WHOLE DAY LONG TILL THE SUN SET AND DARKNESS WAS OVER ALL THE LAND
AND TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE CHARIOT THEY DROVE OUT THROUGH THE INNER GATEWAY AND UNDER THE ECHOING GATEHOUSE OF THE OUTER COURT
THEN HE ADDED THERE LIES OUR PEACEFUL CEMETERY HUNDREDS OF FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES AT LEAST CAPTAIN YOUR DEAD CAN SLEEP SERENELY THERE OUT OF THE REACH OF SHARKS
AN ALARM WOULD INSTANTLY SOUND THROUGHOUT THE COLONY THE WHITE PETALS RETRACTED INTO THEIR RED SHEATHS THE FLOWERS VANISHED BEFORE MY EYES AND THE BUSH CHANGED INTO A CHUNK OF STONY NIPPLES
AND ARRANGED WITH A SYMMETRY THAT BETRAYED THE HAND OF MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLEARING ON A PEDESTAL OF ROUGHLY PILED ROCKS THERE STOOD A CROSS OF CORAL EXTENDING LONG ARMS YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WERE MADE OF PETRIFIED BLOOD
I IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE WONDROUS REGION IN WHICH CAPTAIN NEMO DID THE HONORS THAT DAY IT WAS THE CORAL REALM IN THE ZOOPHYTE BRANCH CLASS ALCYONARIA ONE FINDS THE ORDER GORGONARIA WHICH CONTAINS THREE GROUPS SEA FANS
WHO SERVED ME WITH HIS USUAL MUTE EFFICIENCY NEAR TWO O'CLOCK I WAS BUSY ORGANIZING MY NOTES IN THE LOUNGE WHEN THE CAPTAIN OPENED THE DOOR AND APPEARED I BOWED TO HIM HE GAVE ME AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE BOW IN RETURN WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ME
THE LIGHT FROM OUR GLASS COILS PRODUCED MAGICAL EFFECTS AT TIMES LINGERING ON THE WRINKLED ROUGHNESS OF SOME NATURAL ARCH OR SOME OVERHANG SUSPENDED LIKE A CHANDELIER WHICH OUR LAMPS FLECKED WITH FIERY SPARKS
IT CAME QUITE CLOSE UP TO THEM AND FLEW AWAY ON THEIR RIGHT HANDS IN FRONT OF THE HORSES WHEN THEY SAW IT THEY WERE GLAD AND THEIR HEARTS TOOK COMFORT WITHIN THEM
MURMURED IN THAT LANGUAGE I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE NEXT MORNING I CLIMBED ON DECK CAPTAIN NEMO WAS ALREADY THERE AS SOON AS HE SAW ME HE CAME OVER PROFESSOR HE SAID TO ME
AND ADMIRED THEM ALL AS HE DID SO
WHICH CAN SPEND LONG HOURS EITHER AT SEA OR ON SHORE TRAVELING THROUGH THEIR DOUBLE DOMAIN AS THEIR WHIMS DICTATE MEANWHILE CAPTAIN NEMO HAD CALLED A HALT MY COMPANIONS AND I STOPPED WALKING
THAT THEY MIGHT MAKE A DRINK OFFERING BEFORE THEY SET OUT HE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE HORSES AND PLEDGED THEM SAYING FAREWELL TO BOTH OF YOU SEE THAT YOU TELL NESTOR HOW I HAVE TREATED YOU
THEN THEY ALL APPROACHED THE GRAVE SANK AGAIN ON BENDED KNEE AND EXTENDED THEIR HANDS IN A SIGN OF FINAL FAREWELL THEN THE FUNERAL PARTY WENT BACK UP THE PATH TO THE NAUTILUS RETURNING BENEATH THE ARCHES OF THE FOREST
THE CORAL REALM THE NEXT DAY I WOKE UP WITH MY HEAD UNUSUALLY CLEAR MUCH TO MY SURPRISE I WAS IN MY STATEROOM
AS HE SPOKE DAY BEGAN TO BREAK
I WISH I WERE AS CERTAIN OF FINDING ULYSSES RETURNED WHEN I GET BACK TO ITHACA THAT I MIGHT TELL HIM OF THE VERY GREAT KINDNESS YOU HAVE SHOWN ME AND OF THE MANY BEAUTIFUL PRESENTS I AM TAKING WITH ME
BLOOD CLOTS HAD FORMED IN THIS DISSOLVING MASS TAKING ON THE COLOR OF WINE DREGS BOTH CONTUSION AND CONCUSSION OF THE BRAIN HAD OCCURRED THE SICK MAN'S BREATHING WAS LABORED AND MUSCLE SPASMS QUIVERED IN HIS FACE
HIS FACIAL FEATURES EXPRESSED PROFOUND SADNESS REAL CHAGRIN HE WALKED UP AND DOWN SAT AND STOOD PICKED UP A BOOK AT RANDOM DISCARDED IT IMMEDIATELY CONSULTED HIS INSTRUMENTS WITHOUT TAKING HIS CUSTOMARY NOTES
THESE POLYPS HAVE A UNIQUE GENERATING MECHANISM THAT REPRODUCES THEM VIA THE BUDDING PROCESS AND THEY HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE WHILE ALSO PARTICIPATING IN A COMMUNAL LIFE HENCE THEY EMBODY A SORT OF NATURAL SOCIALISM
AND IN THE END HE DEEMED IT BEST TO TURN HIS HORSES TOWARDS THE SHIP
I LOOKED AT HIS INTELLIGENT HEAD FURROWED WITH PREMATURE WRINKLES THAT MISFORTUNE PERHAPS MISERY HAD ETCHED LONG BEFORE I WAS HOPING TO DETECT THE SECRET OF HIS LIFE IN THE LAST WORDS THAT MIGHT ESCAPE FROM HIS LIPS
AND TEARS SLID FROM HIS EYES WHICH I HAD THOUGHT INCAPABLE OF WEEPING FOR A FEW MOMENTS MORE I OBSERVED THE DYING MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS EBBING LITTLE BY LITTLE HE GREW STILL MORE PALE UNDER THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THAT BATHED HIS DEATHBED
WHERE DIOCLES LIVED WHO WAS SON OF ORTILOCHUS THE SON OF ALPHEUS THERE THEY PASSED THE NIGHT AND WERE TREATED HOSPITABLY WHEN THE CHILD OF MORNING ROSY FINGERED DAWN APPEARED THEY AGAIN YOKED THEIR HORSES AND THEIR PLACES IN THE CHARIOT
WHY WERE WE IMPRISONED BEHIND THESE MASKS OF METAL AND GLASS WHY WERE WE FORBIDDEN TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER AT LEAST LET US LEAD THE LIVES OF THE FISH THAT POPULATE THIS LIQUID ELEMENT OR BETTER YET THE LIVES OF AMPHIBIANS
I WILL YOKE MY HORSES AND WILL CONDUCT YOU MYSELF THROUGH ALL OUR PRINCIPAL CITIES NO ONE WILL SEND US AWAY EMPTY HANDED EVERY ONE WILL GIVE US SOMETHING A BRONZE TRIPOD A COUPLE OF MULES OR A GOLD CUP
SO SAYING SHE GAVE THE ROBE OVER TO HIM AND HE RECEIVED IT GLADLY
THE NAUTILUS SUFFERED A COLLISION THAT CRACKED ONE OF THE ENGINE LEVERS AND IT STRUCK THIS MAN MY CHIEF OFFICER WAS STANDING BESIDE HIM THIS MAN LEAPED FORWARD TO INTERCEPT THE BLOW A BROTHER LAYS DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS BROTHER A FRIEND FOR HIS FRIEND
SHEER CHANCE HAD PLACED ME IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MOST VALUABLE SPECIMENS OF THIS ZOOPHYTE THIS CORAL WAS THE EQUAL OF THOSE FISHED UP FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN OFF THE BARBARY COAST OR THE SHORES OF FRANCE AND ITALY
HATCHES THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED THE DAY BEFORE WERE NOW OPEN I ARRIVED ON THE PLATFORM NED LAND AND CONSEIL WERE THERE WAITING FOR ME I QUESTIONED THEM THEY KNEW NOTHING LOST IN A HEAVY SLEEP OF WHICH THEY HAD NO MEMORY
OUR PATH WAS BORDERED BY HOPELESSLY TANGLED BUSHES FORMED FROM SNARLS OF SHRUBS ALL COVERED WITH LITTLE STAR SHAPED WHITE STREAKED FLOWERS ONLY CONTRARY TO PLANTS ON SHORE THESE TREE FORMS BECOME ATTACHED TO ROCKS ON THE SEAFLOOR BY HEADING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
CEREBRAL INFLAMMATION WAS COMPLETE AND HAD BROUGHT ON A PARALYSIS OF MOVEMENT AND SENSATION I TOOK THE WOUNDED MAN'S PULSE IT WAS INTERMITTENT
I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE IT TO YOU WITH THESE WORDS HE PLACED THE DOUBLE CUP IN THE HANDS OF TELEMACHUS WHILE MEGAPENTHES BROUGHT THE BEAUTIFUL MIXING BOWL AND SET IT BEFORE HIM HARD BY STOOD LOVELY HELEN WITH THE ROBE READY IN HER HAND
I WILL MAKE VOWS TO YOU AS THOUGH YOU WERE A GOD EVEN WHEN I AM AT HOME AS HE SPOKE HE LASHED HIS HORSES AND THEY STARTED OFF AT FULL SPEED THROUGH THE TOWN TOWARDS THE OPEN COUNTRY THEY SWAYED THE YOKE UPON THEIR NECKS
THEY WILL EAT UP EVERYTHING YOU HAVE AMONG THEM AND YOU WILL HAVE BEEN ON A FOOL'S ERRAND
DO NOT THEREFORE TAKE ME PAST MY SHIP BUT LEAVE ME THERE FOR IF I GO TO YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE HE WILL TRY TO KEEP ME IN THE WARMTH OF HIS GOOD WILL TOWARDS ME AND I MUST GO HOME AT ONCE
THE LIQUID STRATA HID ENOUGH TO MAKE THE FORTUNES OF A WHOLE HOST OF CORAL FISHERMEN THIS VALUABLE SUBSTANCE OFTEN MERGES WITH OTHER POLYPARIES FORMING COMPACT HOPELESSLY TANGLED UNITS KNOWN AS MACCIOTA
AND LET HIM SAY GOOD BYE TO US IN THE USUAL WAY SO LONG AS HE LIVES
HE WILL COME DOWN HERE TO FETCH YOU AND HE WILL NOT GO BACK WITHOUT YOU BUT HE WILL BE VERY ANGRY WITH THIS HE DROVE HIS GOODLY STEEDS BACK TO THE CITY OF THE PYLIANS AND SOON REACHED HIS HOME
JEWELRY TO THE MODERNS IT WASN'T DECISIVELY PLACED IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM UNTIL SIXTEEN NINETY FOUR BY PEYSONNEL OF MARSEILLES
I WILL NOW PRESENT YOU WITH THE FINEST AND MOST PRECIOUS PIECE OF PLATE IN ALL MY HOUSE IT IS A MIXING BOWL OF PURE SILVER EXCEPT THE RIM WHICH IS INLAID WITH GOLD AND IT IS THE WORK OF VULCAN
THEY WERE QUITE STARTLED TO BE BACK IN THEIR CABIN AS FOR THE NAUTILUS IT SEEMED AS TRANQUIL AND MYSTERIOUS AS EVER IT WAS CRUISING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES AT A MODERATE SPEED NOTHING SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED ON BOARD
WAS DEEP ENOUGH TO RECEIVE THE BODY THEN THE PALLBEARERS APPROACHED WRAPPED IN WHITE FABRIC MADE FROM FILAMENTS OF THE FAN MUSSEL THE BODY WAS LOWERED INTO ITS WATERY GRAVE
HAS HEAVEN SENT THIS OMEN FOR US OR FOR YOU
SAID HE LET ME GO BACK NOW TO MY OWN COUNTRY FOR I WANT TO GET HOME
THAN TO VISIT ONE OF THESE PETRIFIED FORESTS THAT NATURE HAS PLANTED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA WE TURNED ON OUR RUHMKORFF DEVICES AND WENT ALONG A CORAL SHOAL IN THE PROCESS OF FORMING WHICH GIVEN TIME WILL SOMEDAY CLOSE OFF THIS WHOLE PART OF THE INDIAN OCEAN
MISSUS DASHWOOD AGAIN ASSURED HIM THAT NO ALTERATION OF THE KIND SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED YOU ARE A GOOD WOMAN HE WARMLY REPLIED YOUR PROMISE MAKES ME EASY EXTEND IT A LITTLE FARTHER AND IT WILL MAKE ME HAPPY
AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE METERS
CAPTAIN NEMO STOPPED STRAIGHTENED UP TOOK A FEW STEPS ALONG THE PLATFORM AND RETURNED TO ME AS FOR THOSE BILLIONS OF TINY ANIMALS HE WENT ON THOSE INFUSORIA THAT LIVE BY THE MILLIONS IN ONE DROPLET OF WATER
SEEMED EVEN YET TO BE GUIDING HIS WRECKED THREE MASTER THROUGH THE OCEAN DEPTHS WHAT A SCENE
THEN HIS OPERATIONS FINISHED HE WENT AND LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE BEACON HOUSING HIS EYES STRAYING OVER THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN MEANWHILE SOME TWENTY OF THE NAUTILUS'S SAILORS ALL ENERGETIC WELL BUILT FELLOWS CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
I STOOD UP WENT LEANED ON MY ELBOWS BEFORE THE WINDOW AND I SAW IT
AND A CHAIN LACED THROUGH THE LOWER MESHES TRAILING IN THIS WAY FROM THESE IRON GLOVE MAKERS THE RESULTING RECEPTACLES SCOURED THE OCEAN FLOOR AND COLLECTED EVERY MARINE EXHIBIT IN THEIR PATH THAT DAY THEY GATHERED UP SOME UNUSUAL SPECIMENS
THAT NATURE HAS ROOTED IN THEIR HEADS LIKE A HAIRPIECE OF PNEUMATIC SNAKES DESPITE ITS SPEED THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN THE MIDST OF THIS SCHOOL OF ANIMALS AND ITS NETS BROUGHT UP AN INCALCULABLE NUMBER
THAT THE NAUTILUS ENCOUNTERED THIS ARMY OF DISTINCTLY NOCTURNAL MOLLUSKS THEY NUMBERED IN THE MILLIONS THEY WERE MIGRATING FROM THE TEMPERATE ZONES TOWARD ZONES STILL WARMER FOLLOWING THE ITINERARIES OF HERRING AND SARDINES WE STARED AT THEM THROUGH OUR THICK GLASS WINDOWS
A SORRY SIGHT THIS CARCASS LOST UNDER THE WAVES
THE SERVANTS OF THE STOMACH AND SAVORING ITS INGENIOUS TEACHINGS WHEN CONSEIL INTERRUPTED MY READING WOULD MASTER KINDLY COME HERE FOR AN INSTANT HE SAID TO ME IN AN ODD VOICE WHAT IS IT CONSEIL
AFTER ITS FISHING WAS FINISHED AND ITS AIR SUPPLY RENEWED I THOUGHT THE NAUTILUS WOULD RESUME ITS UNDERWATER EXCURSION AND I WAS GETTING READY TO RETURN TO MY STATEROOM
HOW OFTEN DID I WISH ADDED HE WHEN I WAS AT ALLENHAM THIS TIME TWELVEMONTH THAT BARTON COTTAGE WERE INHABITED I NEVER PASSED WITHIN VIEW OF IT WITHOUT ADMIRING ITS SITUATION AND GRIEVING THAT NO ONE SHOULD LIVE IN IT
WHICH THE NAUTILUS'S SPEED AND THE ALLURE OF ITS ELECTRIC LIGHT COULD CONTINUALLY REPLENISH THESE VARIOUS EXHIBITS FROM THE SEA WERE IMMEDIATELY LOWERED DOWN THE HATCH IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STORAGE LOCKERS SOME TO BE EATEN FRESH OTHERS TO BE PRESERVED
IT WAS A FINE CATCH BUT NOT SURPRISING IN ESSENCE THESE NETS STAYED IN OUR WAKE FOR SEVERAL HOURS INCARCERATING AN ENTIRE AQUATIC WORLD IN PRISONS MADE OF THREAD SO WE WERE NEVER LACKING IN PROVISIONS OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY
HER DESIGN OF IMPROVING THE COTTAGE IN THE SPRING HE WARMLY OPPOSED EVERY ALTERATION OF A PLACE WHICH AFFECTION HAD ESTABLISHED AS PERFECT WITH HIM WHAT HE EXCLAIMED IMPROVE THIS DEAR COTTAGE NO THAT I WILL NEVER CONSENT TO
CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE SUDDEN TERMINATION OF COLONEL BRANDON'S VISIT AT THE PARK WITH HIS STEADINESS IN CONCEALING ITS CAUSE FILLED THE MIND AND RAISED THE WONDER OF MISSUS JENNINGS FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS SHE WAS A GREAT WONDERER
THERE HE ADDED OUT THERE LIES TRUE EXISTENCE AND I CAN IMAGINE THE FOUNDING OF NAUTICAL TOWNS CLUSTERS OF UNDERWATER HOUSEHOLDS THAT LIKE THE NAUTILUS
THE STUMPS OF THREE MASTS CHOPPED OFF TWO FEET ABOVE THE DECK INDICATED A FLOODING SHIP THAT HAD BEEN FORCED TO SACRIFICE ITS MASTING
SCALY FEATHERBACKS WITH BROWN CROSSWISE BANDS GREENISH CODFISH SEVERAL VARIETIES OF GOBY ET CETERA FINALLY SOME FISH OF LARGER PROPORTIONS A ONE METER JACK WITH A PROMINENT HEAD
AN ELEMENT FATAL TO MAN THEY SAY BUT VITAL TO MYRIADS OF ANIMALS AND TO ME
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN I RECOGNIZED SOME IRISHMEN SOME FRENCHMEN A FEW SLAVS AND A NATIVE OF EITHER GREECE OR CRETE EVEN SO THESE MEN WERE FRUGAL OF SPEECH AND USED AMONG THEMSELVES ONLY THAT BIZARRE DIALECT
WITH A FIXED DETERMINATION THAT HE SHOULD NOT ESCAPE THEM ALL SOMETHING VERY MELANCHOLY MUST BE THE MATTER I AM SURE SAID SHE I COULD SEE IT IN HIS FACE
FROM THESE FISH FILLED WATERWAYS ANGLERFISH WHOSE COMICAL MOVEMENTS QUALIFY THEM FOR THE EPITHET CLOWNS BLACK COMMERSON ANGLERS EQUIPPED WITH THEIR ANTENNAS UNDULATING TRIGGERFISH ENCIRCLED BY LITTLE RED BANDS
AS EVERY ONE MUST BE WHO TAKES A VERY LIVELY INTEREST IN ALL THE COMINGS AND GOINGS OF ALL THEIR ACQUAINTANCE SHE WONDERED WITH LITTLE INTERMISSION WHAT COULD BE THE REASON OF IT WAS SURE THERE MUST BE SOME BAD NEWS
YOU WILL HEREAFTER FIND YOUR OWN HOUSE AS FAULTLESS AS YOU NOW DO THIS THERE CERTAINLY ARE CIRCUMSTANCES SAID WILLOUGHBY
BLOATED PUFFERS WHOSE VENOM IS EXTREMELY INSIDIOUS SOME OLIVE HUED LAMPREYS SNIPEFISH COVERED WITH SILVER SCALES
BUT HE LIVED AT AN EXPENSE TO WHICH THAT INCOME COULD HARDLY BE EQUAL AND HE HAD HIMSELF OFTEN COMPLAINED OF HIS POVERTY BUT FOR THIS STRANGE KIND OF SECRECY MAINTAINED BY THEM RELATIVE TO THEIR ENGAGEMENT WHICH IN FACT CONCEALED NOTHING AT ALL
SHOULD THE LEAST VARIATION BE PERCEPTIBLE THEN AND THEN ONLY UNDER SUCH A ROOF I MIGHT PERHAPS BE AS HAPPY AT COMBE AS I HAVE BEEN AT BARTON I FLATTER MYSELF REPLIED ELINOR THAT EVEN UNDER THE DISADVANTAGE OF BETTER ROOMS AND A BROADER STAIRCASE
BUT ARE YOU REALLY SO ATTACHED TO THIS PLACE AS TO SEE NO DEFECT IN IT I AM SAID HE TO ME IT IS FAULTLESS NAY MORE I CONSIDER IT AS THE ONLY FORM OF BUILDING IN WHICH HAPPINESS IS ATTAINABLE
THEIR ROLE IS NO LESS IMPORTANT THEY ABSORB THE MARINE SALTS THEY ASSIMILATE THE SOLID ELEMENTS IN THE WATER
WHOSE ORIGIN I COULDN'T EVEN GUESS SO I HAD TO GIVE UP ANY NOTIONS OF QUESTIONING THEM THE NETS WERE HAULED ON BOARD THEY WERE A BREED OF TRAWL RESEMBLING THOSE USED OFF THE NORMANDY COAST
WHOSE ELEVATION IS FIVE THOUSAND METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL AMONG OTHER SPECIMENS FROM THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP SOME PEACOCK TAILED FLABELLARIAN CORAL POLYPS FLATTENED INTO STYLISH SHAPES AND UNIQUE TO THIS PART OF THE OCEAN
HAS ONLY TO INCREASE ITS HEAT SALT AND MICROSCOPIC ANIMAL LIFE IN ESSENCE HEAT CREATES THE DIFFERENT DENSITIES THAT LEAD TO CURRENTS AND COUNTERCURRENTS EVAPORATION
BUT THIS PLACE WILL ALWAYS HAVE ONE CLAIM OF MY AFFECTION WHICH NO OTHER CAN POSSIBLY SHARE MISSUS DASHWOOD LOOKED WITH PLEASURE AT MARIANNE WHOSE FINE EYES WERE FIXED SO EXPRESSIVELY ON WILLOUGHBY AS PLAINLY DENOTED HOW WELL SHE UNDERSTOOD HIM
I WAS MARVELING AT THIS MAGNIFICENT OCEAN VIEW
THE NAUTILUS KEPT TO ITS SOUTHEASTERLY HEADING
IN THE MIDST OF THE LIQUID ELEMENT BUT ALSO TO PROBE THE OCEAN'S MOST DAUNTING MYSTERIES DURING THE DAY OF DECEMBER ELEVENTH I WAS BUSY READING IN THE MAIN LOUNGE NED LAND AND CONSEIL WERE OBSERVING THE LUMINOUS WATERS THROUGH THE GAPING PANELS
I AM HEARTILY GLAD OF IT HE CRIED MAY SHE ALWAYS BE POOR IF SHE CAN EMPLOY HER RICHES NO BETTER THANK YOU WILLOUGHBY BUT YOU MAY BE ASSURED THAT I WOULD NOT SACRIFICE ONE SENTIMENT OF LOCAL ATTACHMENT OF YOURS OR OF ANY ONE WHOM I LOVED
ITS AVERAGE DEPTH WOULD BE ABOUT SEVEN KILOMETERS WELL PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED WE'LL SHOW YOU BETTER THAN THAT I HOPE AS FOR THE AVERAGE DEPTH OF THIS PART OF THE PACIFIC I'LL INFORM YOU THAT IT'S A MERE FOUR THOUSAND METERS
THIS WOMAN WAS YOUNG UNDER THE BRILLIANT LIGHTING OF THE NAUTILUS'S RAYS
FOR WHAT ELSE CAN IT BE I WONDER WHETHER IT IS SO I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO KNOW THE TRUTH OF IT PERHAPS IT IS ABOUT MISS WILLIAMS AND BY THE BYE I DARE SAY IT IS BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO CONSCIOUS WHEN I MENTIONED HER
HOWEVER FROM LORD KNOWS WHAT WHIM
MAY BE SHE IS ILL IN TOWN NOTHING IN THE WORLD MORE LIKELY FOR I HAVE A NOTION SHE IS ALWAYS RATHER SICKLY I WOULD LAY ANY WAGER IT IS ABOUT MISS WILLIAMS IT IS NOT SO VERY LIKELY HE SHOULD BE DISTRESSED IN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES NOW
ON NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTH AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE NAUTILUS CLEARED THE TROPIC OF CANCER AT LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO DEGREES ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT PASSED IN SIGHT OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS WHERE THE FAMOUS CAPTAIN COOK MET HIS DEATH
FOR ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE WORLD DEPEND UPON IT THAT WHATEVER UNEMPLOYED SUM MAY REMAIN WHEN I MAKE UP MY ACCOUNTS IN THE SPRING I WOULD EVEN RATHER LAY IT USELESSLY BY THAN DISPOSE OF IT IN A MANNER SO PAINFUL TO YOU
THEY SWAM BACKWARD WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED MOVING BY MEANS OF THEIR LOCOMOTIVE TUBES
TELL ME THAT NOT ONLY YOUR HOUSE WILL REMAIN THE SAME BUT THAT I SHALL EVER FIND YOU AND YOURS AS UNCHANGED AS YOUR DWELLING AND THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS CONSIDER ME WITH THE KINDNESS WHICH HAS MADE EVERYTHING BELONGING TO YOU SO DEAR TO ME THE PROMISE WAS READILY GIVEN
FOR HE IS A VERY PRUDENT MAN AND TO BE SURE MUST HAVE CLEARED THE ESTATE BY THIS TIME I WONDER WHAT IT CAN BE MAY BE HIS SISTER IS WORSE AT AVIGNON AND HAS SENT FOR HIM OVER HIS SETTING OFF IN SUCH A HURRY SEEMS VERY LIKE IT
THE PROPELLER WAS INSTANTLY SET IN MOTION AND THE LOG GAVE OUR SPEED AS TWENTY MILES PER HOUR OVER THE ENSUING DAYS AND WEEKS CAPTAIN NEMO WAS VERY FRUGAL WITH HIS VISITS I SAW HIM ONLY AT RARE INTERVALS
MADREPORES THEY'RE THE TRUE BUILDERS OF LIMESTONE CONTINENTS AND SO AFTER THEY'VE FINISHED DEPRIVING OUR WATER DROP OF ITS MINERAL NUTRIENTS THE DROPLET GETS LIGHTER RISES TO THE SURFACE THERE ABSORBS MORE SALTS LEFT BEHIND THROUGH EVAPORATION GETS HEAVIER
AND EVERY BODY WOULD BE EAGER TO PASS THROUGH THE ROOM WHICH HAS HITHERTO CONTAINED WITHIN ITSELF MORE REAL ACCOMMODATION AND COMFORT THAN ANY OTHER APARTMENT OF THE HANDSOMEST DIMENSIONS IN THE WORLD COULD POSSIBLY AFFORD
DOESN'T IT EXPERIENCE BOTH ANGER AND AFFECTION LAST EVENING IT WENT TO SLEEP JUST AS WE DID AND THERE IT IS WAKING UP AFTER A PEACEFUL NIGHT NO HELLOS OR GOOD MORNINGS FOR THIS GENT YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS ECCENTRIC INDIVIDUAL WAS SIMPLY CONTINUING A CONVERSATION WE'D ALREADY STARTED
LOOK AT THIS OCEAN PROFESSOR
COMMANDER MAURY WHO DISCOVERED THAT IT HAS A CIRCULATION AS REAL AS THE CIRCULATION OF BLOOD IN ANIMALS I'M SURE THAT CAPTAIN NEMO EXPECTED NO REPLIES FROM ME AND IT SEEMED POINTLESS TO PITCH IN WITH AH YES EXACTLY OR HOW RIGHT YOU ARE
AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED METERS WAS FOUND IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METERS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN THE MOST REMARKABLE SOUNDINGS WERE TAKEN IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC NEAR THE THIRTY FIFTH PARALLEL AND THEY GAVE TWELVE THOUSAND METERS
WHICH THE WATER HADN'T YET DECOMPOSED WITH A SUPREME EFFORT SHE HAD LIFTED HER CHILD ABOVE HER HEAD AND THE POOR LITTLE CREATURE'S ARMS WERE STILL TWINED AROUND ITS MOTHER'S NECK THE POSTURES OF THE FOUR SEAMEN SEEMED GHASTLY TO ME TWISTED FROM CONVULSIVE MOVEMENTS
NOTHING COULD BE MORE EXPRESSIVE OF ATTACHMENT TO THEM ALL THAN WILLOUGHBY'S BEHAVIOUR TO MARIANNE IT HAD ALL THE DISTINGUISHING TENDERNESS WHICH A LOVER'S HEART COULD GIVE AND TO THE REST OF THE FAMILY IT WAS THE AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION OF A SON AND A BROTHER
NED LAND WAS NOT MISTAKEN WE WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A SHIP WHOSE SEVERED SHROUDS STILL HUNG FROM THEIR CLASPS ITS HULL LOOKED IN GOOD CONDITION
EVERY DAY MADE IT APPEAR MORE STRANGE AND MORE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE DISPOSITION OF BOTH WHY THEY SHOULD NOT OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGE TO HER MOTHER AND HERSELF WHAT THEIR CONSTANT BEHAVIOUR TO EACH OTHER DECLARED TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE
WRASSE FROM THE GENUS HOLOGYMNOSUS THAT WERE NEARLY DENUDED OF SCALES BUT EXQUISITE IN FLAVOR KNIFEJAWS WITH BONY BEAKS YELLOWISH ALBACORE THAT WERE AS TASTY AS BONITO
THEN COOL OFF GROW LIGHTER AND RISE AGAIN AT THE POLES YOU'LL SEE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PHENOMENON AND THROUGH THIS LAW OF FARSEEING NATURE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY WATER CAN FREEZE ONLY AT THE SURFACE AS THE CAPTAIN WAS FINISHING HIS SENTENCE I SAID TO MYSELF THE POLE
HUNG SUSPENDED IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS I OBSERVED IT CAREFULLY TRYING TO FIND OUT THE NATURE OF THIS GIGANTIC CETACEAN THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT CROSSED MY MIND A SHIP I EXCLAIMED YES THE CANADIAN REPLIED A DISABLED CRAFT THAT'S SINKING STRAIGHT DOWN
THOUGH SHE FELT REALLY INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF COLONEL BRANDON COULD NOT BESTOW ALL THE WONDER ON HIS GOING SO SUDDENLY AWAY WHICH MISSUS JENNINGS WAS DESIROUS OF HER FEELING FOR BESIDES THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID NOT IN HER OPINION JUSTIFY SUCH LASTING AMAZEMENT
YOU'D CREATE A MASS MEASURING FOUR MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUBIC LEAGUES WHICH IF IT WERE SPREAD ALL OVER THE GLOBE WOULD FORM A LAYER MORE THAN TEN METERS HIGH AND DON'T THINK THAT THE PRESENCE OF THESE SALTS IS DUE MERELY TO SOME WHIM OF NATURE NO
AND GREEDINESS OF THE STAR CHAMBER
IT SEEMED THAT THE INDEPENDENTS WERE TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE PRESBYTERIANS AND THAT THE MEN OF THE SWORD WERE TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE MEN OF THE GOWN A COALITION
AND ABUSES WHICH WERE IN STRICT CONFORMITY WITH THE LAW AND WHICH HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY THE SWORD GAVE GENERAL SATISFACTION
THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FIRST MAGISTRATE AND NO HOUSE OF LORDS BUT THIS STATE OF THINGS COULD NOT LAST ON THE
THEY ACCORDINGLY DOLED OUT SUPPLIES TO HIM VERY SPARINGLY
THAN A CLASS OF COURTS THE MEMORY OF WHICH IS STILL AFTER THE LAPSE OF MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES HELD IN DEEP ABHORRENCE BY THE NATION FOREMOST AMONG THESE COURTS IN POWER AND IN INFAMY WERE THE STAR CHAMBER
THE GREAT LEADEN WEIGHT RAN DOWN TO THE FLOOR BUMP AND THEN THE CLOCK ALSO STOOD STILL BUT THE POOR MOTHER RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND CRIED ALOUD FOR HER CHILD
TRIBES AND GALAXIES THE LORD ARCHON AND THE LORD STRATEGUS WHICH BALLOT BOXES WERE TO BE GREEN AND WHICH RED WHICH BALLS WERE TO BE OF GOLD AND WHICH OF SILVER WHICH MAGISTRATES WERE TO WEAR HATS AND WHICH BLACK VELVET CAPS WITH PEAKS
AND STRETCHED HER HANDS OUT OVER A LITTLE BLUE CROCUS THAT HUNG QUITE SICKLY ON ONE SIDE
THERE WERE LARGE TREES IN SMALL POTS SO THAT THEY STOOD SO STUNTED IN GROWTH
THE OLD MAN SAT AND ROCKED THE CRADLE
WHICH HE HAD INHERITED HE HAD NEVER LED THEM TO VICTORY HE HAD NEVER EVEN BORNE ARMS
HE SAW THAT THERE WAS ONE INSTRUMENT
IT WAS PLAYED ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WITH KEENNESS BUT WITH ADMIRABLE DEXTERITY COOLNESS AND PERSEVERANCE GREAT STATESMEN WHO LOOKED FAR BEHIND THEM AND FAR BEFORE THEM WERE AT THE HEAD OF THAT ASSEMBLY
SHE THEN CAME TO A LARGE LAKE WHERE THERE WAS NEITHER SHIP NOR BOAT THE LAKE WAS NOT FROZEN SUFFICIENTLY TO BEAR HER NEITHER WAS IT OPEN
FOR THE DREAD OF THAT INVINCIBLE ARMY WAS ON ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE ISLAND AND THE CAVALIERS TAUGHT BY A HUNDRED DISASTROUS FIELDS HOW LITTLE NUMBERS CAN EFFECT AGAINST DISCIPLINE
HIS CHOICE WAS SOON MADE HE DISSOLVED HIS FIRST PARLIAMENT AND LEVIED TAXES BY HIS OWN AUTHORITY HE CONVOKED A SECOND PARLIAMENT AND FOUND IT MORE INTRACTABLE THAN THE FIRST
AND THEY PURSUED THE OBJECTS OF THEIR WILD AMBITION NOT LIKE HIM
ON THE TROOPS IF THE PRESBYTERIANS OBSTINATELY STOOD ALOOF FROM THE ROYALISTS THE STATE WAS LOST AND MEN MIGHT WELL DOUBT WHETHER BY THE COMBINED EXERTIONS OF PRESBYTERIANS AND ROYALISTS IT COULD BE SAVED
ONE CHOICE ONLY WAS LEFT THE STUARTS OR THE ARMY THE BANISHED FAMILY HAD COMMITTED GREAT FAULTS BUT IT HAD DEARLY EXPIATED THOSE FAULTS AND HAD UNDERGONE A LONG AND IT MIGHT BE HOPED A SALUTARY TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL OF ADVERSITY
AND SHE WEPT AND PRAYED AT ONCE SHE SEIZED HOLD OF TWO BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS CLOSE BY WITH EACH HAND AND CRIED OUT TO DEATH
UNDER A NEW DYNASTY RICHARD WAS SOLEMNLY RECOGNISED AS FIRST MAGISTRATE
WAS THE COUNSELLOR MOST TRUSTED IN POLITICAL AND MILITARY AFFAIRS
THEY WERE AS WELL BORN AS HE AND AS WELL EDUCATED THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
IN THAT YEAR THE ROYAL SOCIETY DESTINED TO BE A CHIEF AGENT IN A LONG SERIES OF GLORIOUS AND SALUTARY REFORMS
WAS FORMED BETWEEN THE MILITARY MALECONTENTS AND THE REPUBLICAN MINORITY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IT MAY WELL BE DOUBTED WHETHER RICHARD COULD HAVE TRIUMPHED OVER THAT COALITION EVEN IF HE HAD INHERITED HIS FATHER'S CLEAR JUDGMENT AND IRON COURAGE
THE PROMISE BY WHICH THAT SUPPLY HAD BEEN OBTAINED WAS BROKEN
THAT PARTY HAD ALWAYS BEEN DESIROUS TO SEE THE OLD CIVIL POLITY
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
NAMED BY THE OFFICERS ASSUMED THE DIRECTION OF AFFAIRS
AND BEGAN TO TREAT THEM AS SUBJECTS
ONLY ONCE HAD THERE BEEN AN INTERVAL OF EVEN HALF THAT LENGTH THIS FACT ALONE IS SUFFICIENT TO REFUTE THOSE WHO REPRESENT CHARLES AS HAVING MERELY TRODDEN IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE PLANTAGENETS AND TUDORS
WHILE HE ON THE ROCK OF SAINT HELENA MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
WAS SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE SHOULD NEVER HAVE REPROACHED HIM WITH THIS GREAT VICE
AND WAS MUCH MORE DISPOSED THAN HIS FATHER TO CARRY THEM INTO PRACTICE HE WAS LIKE HIS FATHER A ZEALOUS EPISCOPALIAN HE WAS MOREOVER WHAT HIS FATHER HAD NEVER BEEN A ZEALOUS ARMINIAN
IT HAD SPRUNG FROM MILITARY VIOLENCE IT HAD BEEN FRUITFUL OF NOTHING BUT DISPUTES THE WHOLE NATION WAS SICK OF GOVERNMENT BY THE SWORD AND PINED FOR GOVERNMENT BY THE LAW
HE FELL INGLORIOUSLY AND WITHOUT A STRUGGLE HE WAS USED BY THE ARMY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISSOLVING THE PARLIAMENT AND WAS THEN CONTEMPTUOUSLY THROWN ASIDE
AND NO ONE DARES TO PLUCK THEM UP BEFORE HE GIVES LEAVE
AND SHE LOOKED DOWN INTO THE WELL
WHICH OF THEM WAS MY CHILD TELL IT ME SAVE THE INNOCENT SAVE MY CHILD FROM ALL THAT MISERY RATHER TAKE IT AWAY TAKE IT INTO GOD'S KINGDOM FORGET MY TEARS FORGET MY PRAYERS AND ALL THAT I HAVE DONE
SO TIGHT AND YET AFRAID THAT SHE SHOULD TOUCH ONE OF THE LEAVES THEN DEATH BLEW ON HER HANDS AND SHE FELT THAT IT WAS COLDER THAN THE COLD WIND AND HER HANDS FELL DOWN POWERLESS
AND TO PUNISH WITH MERCILESS RIGOUR ALL WHO MURMURED AT THE ACTS OF THE GOVERNMENT
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE WAY HITHER AND WHO HAS HELPED YOU OUR LORD HAS HELPED ME SAID SHE
WAS A COURSE WHICH HENRY THE EIGHTH HIMSELF WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO TAKE IT SEEMED THEREFORE THAT THE DECISIVE HOUR WAS APPROACHING
STRONG STEMMED PEONIES THERE GREW WATER PLANTS SOME SO FRESH OTHERS HALF SICK
I AM A MOTHER SAID SHE AND DEATH STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG HAND TOWARDS THE FINE LITTLE FLOWER
WHILE FACTIONS WERE STRUGGLING FOR DOMINION OVER EACH OTHER A SMALL BODY OF SAGES HAD TURNED AWAY WITH BENEVOLENT DISDAIN FROM THE CONFLICT AND HAD DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE NOBLER WORK OF EXTENDING THE DOMINION OF MAN OVER MATTER
AND THE HIGH COMMISSION THE FORMER A POLITICAL THE LATTER A RELIGIOUS INQUISITION NEITHER WAS A PART OF THE OLD CONSTITUTION OF ENGLAND THE STAR CHAMBER HAD BEEN REMODELLED AND THE HIGH COMMISSION CREATED BY THE TUDORS
EDMUND HALLEY INVESTIGATED THE PROPERTIES OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE EBB AND FLOW OF THE SEA THE LAWS OF MAGNETISM AND THE COURSE OF THE COMETS NOR DID HE SHRINK FROM TOIL PERIL AND EXILE IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE
HE GOES FASTER THAN THE WIND AND HE NEVER BRINGS BACK WHAT HE TAKES OH ONLY TELL ME WHICH WAY HE WENT SAID THE MOTHER
AND BY CHEERFUL RESIGNATION UNDER CRUEL WRONGS AND MISFORTUNES BUT THE CANT THEN
TO FINE IMPRISON
APPROVED BY THE MILITARY SAINTS
THE ROADS CROSSED EACH OTHER IN THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST AND SHE NO LONGER KNEW WHITHER SHE SHOULD GO
AND SHE FLEW IN THE ROCKING WAVES TO THE SHORE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
IT WAS THEN THAT RAY MADE A NEW CLASSIFICATION OF BIRDS AND FISHES AND THAT THE ATTENTION OF WOODWARD WAS FIRST DRAWN TOWARDS FOSSILS AND SHELLS
HASTENED THE CRISIS ALARM AND RESENTMENT SPREAD THROUGH THE CAMP
AND SET IT ON THE STOVE
KNOW FROM ME THAT THE ONE FLOWER WAS THY OWN CHILD IT WAS THY CHILD'S FATE THOU SAW'ST THY OWN CHILD'S FUTURE LIFE THEN THE MOTHER SCREAMED WITH TERROR
HAD AT LENGTH PRODUCED AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE CAVALIERS AND THE PRESBYTERIANS SOME PRESBYTERIANS HAD INDEED BEEN DISPOSED TO SUCH AN ALLIANCE EVEN BEFORE THE DEATH OF CHARLES THE FIRST BUT IT WAS
FOR A TIME IT SEEMED HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD UNDER THE DIRECTION OF ABLE ADVISERS EFFECT WHAT HIS FATHER HAD ATTEMPTED IN VAIN A PARLIAMENT WAS CALLED AND THE WRITS WERE DIRECTED AFTER THE OLD FASHION
THE TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD THE PONDERATION OF AIR THE FIXATION OF MERCURY SUCCEEDED TO THAT PLACE IN THE PUBLIC MIND WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY OCCUPIED BY THE CONTROVERSIES OF THE ROTA
BUT DO NOT STOP ME NOW I MAY OVERTAKE HIM I MAY FIND MY CHILD BUT NIGHT STOOD STILL AND MUTE THEN THE MOTHER WRUNG HER HANDS
WHICH IS THE BEST HEAR ME NOT HEAR ME NOT
YET THE EFFECT OF THOSE TROUBLES WAS THAT SCHEMES OF POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS REFORM WERE GENERALLY REGARDED WITH SUSPICION AND CONTEMPT DURING TWENTY YEARS THE CHIEF EMPLOYMENT OF BUSY AND INGENIOUS MEN HAD BEEN TO FRAME CONSTITUTIONS WITH FIRST MAGISTRATES
IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO A GENERATION WHICH HAS BEEN EXCITED ALMOST TO MADNESS BY THE QUESTION OF PARLIAMENTARY REFORM
THE GREAT PLAGUE OF SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE INDUCED THEM TO CONSIDER WITH CARE THE DEFECTIVE ARCHITECTURE
HE HAD RECEIVED FROM NATURE A FAR BETTER UNDERSTANDING A FAR STRONGER WILL
IT SEEMED BUT TOO LIKELY THAT ENGLAND WOULD FALL UNDER THE MOST ODIOUS
WHEN AN OLD WOMAN WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THEM FOR RIDING ON BROOMSTICKS OR GIVING CATTLE THE MURRAIN BUT IT WAS IN THOSE NOBLEST AND MOST ARDUOUS DEPARTMENTS OF
EVERY TREE AND EVERY FLOWER HAD ITS NAME EACH OF THEM WAS A HUMAN LIFE THE HUMAN FRAME STILL LIVED ONE IN CHINA AND ANOTHER IN GREENLAND ROUND ABOUT IN THE WORLD
AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE CROWN TO DEPRIVE THE COURTS OF LAW OF ALL INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY
AND OF DOUBLEKEELED SHIPS WHICH WERE NEVER TO FOUNDER IN THE
AND BY INVITING THAT ASSEMBLY TO RESUME ITS FUNCTIONS THE OLD SPEAKER AND A QUORUM OF THE OLD MEMBERS CAME TOGETHER AND WERE PROCLAIMED AMIDST THE SCARCELY STIFLED DERISION AND EXECRATION OF THE WHOLE NATION THE SUPREME POWER IN THE COMMONWEALTH
COULD WADE THROUGH IT AND ACROSS IT SHE MUST GO IF SHE WOULD FIND HER CHILD THEN SHE LAY DOWN TO DRINK UP THE LAKE AND THAT WAS AN IMPOSSIBILITY FOR A HUMAN BEING BUT THE AFFLICTED MOTHER THOUGHT THAT A MIRACLE MIGHT HAPPEN NEVERTHELESS
THE CLERK HAD PRONOUNCED THE ANCIENT FORM OF WORDS BY WHICH OUR PRINCES HAVE DURING MANY AGES
AND HEARD WITHIN THEM HOW THE HUMAN HEART BEAT
THAT A LARGE PART OF THE REVENUE WAS RAISED WITHOUT ANY LEGAL AUTHORITY AND THAT PERSONS OBNOXIOUS TO THE GOVERNMENT LANGUISHED FOR YEARS IN PRISON WITHOUT BEING EVER CALLED UPON TO PLEAD BEFORE ANY TRIBUNAL
AND LOOKED AT HER LITTLE SICK CHILD THAT DREW ITS BREATH SO DEEP AND RAISED ITS LITTLE HAND
A COHERENCE A PRECISION WHICH IF HE HAD NOT BEEN PURSUING AN OBJECT
MANY ENGLISH KINGS HAD OCCASIONALLY COMMITTED UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTS BUT NONE HAD EVER SYSTEMATICALLY ATTEMPTED TO MAKE HIMSELF A DESPOT AND TO REDUCE THE PARLIAMENT TO A NULLITY
HIS HUMANITY INGENUOUSNESS AND MODESTY THE MEDIOCRITY OF HIS ABILITIES AND THE DOCILITY WITH WHICH HE SUBMITTED TO THE GUIDANCE OF PERSONS WISER THAN HIMSELF ADMIRABLY QUALIFIED HIM TO BE THE HEAD OF A LIMITED MONARCHY
DURING A WHOLE GENERATION HIS PHILOSOPHY HAD AMIDST TUMULTS WARS AND PROSCRIPTIONS BEEN SLOWLY RIPENING IN A FEW WELL CONSTITUTED MINDS
A DEFICIENCY IN THEIR REVENUE BY A BENEVOLENCE OR A FORCED LOAN BUT THESE EXPEDIENTS WERE ALWAYS OF A TEMPORARY NATURE TO MEET THE REGULAR CHARGE OF A LONG WAR BY REGULAR TAXATION
IN THE CHARACTER OF LADY VERINDER'S HOUSE STEWARD ALL QUITE COMFORTABLE AND ALL THROUGH ROBINSON CRUSOE MY DAUGHTER PENELOPE HAS JUST LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER TO SEE WHAT I HAVE DONE SO FAR
EVER FIND THEIR OWN SELVES GETTING IN THE WAY OF THEIR SUBJECTS LIKE ME IF THEY DO I CAN FEEL FOR THEM IN THE MEANTIME HERE IS ANOTHER FALSE START AND MORE WASTE OF GOOD WRITING PAPER WHAT'S TO BE DONE NOW
AFTER LEAVING MISTER FRANKLIN AND ME AT THE SHIVERING SAND ROSANNA IT APPEARED HAD RETURNED TO THE HOUSE IN A VERY UNACCOUNTABLE STATE OF MIND SHE HAD TURNED IF PENELOPE WAS TO BE BELIEVED ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
WHAT TO MORROW WE HATE I SAW MY WAY CLEAR DIRECTLY TO DAY I WAS ALL FOR CONTINUING TO BE FARM BAILIFF TO MORROW ON THE AUTHORITY OF ROBINSON CRUSOE I SHOULD BE ALL THE OTHER WAY TAKE MYSELF TO MORROW
UNDERSTANDING NOTHING MYSELF BUT THAT I WAS FREE TO PUT IT NEXT TO SELINA I WENT AND PUT IT ACCORDINGLY AND WHAT DID SELINA SAY
A DOCTOR DOES WHEN RECOMMENDED BY AN OLD WOMAN TO TAKE SOME FAVOURITE DOSE OR AS A LAWYER WHEN AN UNPROFESSIONAL MAN ATTEMPTS TO PUT HIM DOWN BY A QUIBBLE I SHALL HAVE THE LIVING OF CRABTREE MODESTLY SUGGESTED THE WARDEN
I SAID NOTHING TO SAMUEL BUT REMEMBERING WHAT PENELOPE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE JUGGLERS AND THE POURING OF THE LITTLE POOL OF INK INTO THE PALM OF THE BOY'S HAND
AND DEPEND ON THE NATURAL SWEETNESS OF WOMEN FOR KISSING AND MAKING IT UP AGAIN AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY THE AFTERNOON WORE ON AND MY LADY AND MISS RACHEL CAME BACK NEEDLESS TO SAY HOW ASTONISHED THEY WERE WHEN THEY HEARD THAT MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE HAD ARRIVED
THE EVENING CAME AND THE DRESSING BELL FOR DINNER RANG BEFORE MISTER FRANKLIN RETURNED FROM FRIZINGHALL I TOOK HIS HOT WATER UP TO HIS ROOM MYSELF EXPECTING TO HEAR AFTER THIS EXTRAORDINARY DELAY
AFTER THAT IT WAS ALL OVER WITH ME OF COURSE I GOT THE NEW COAT AS CHEAP AS I COULD AND I WENT THROUGH ALL THE REST OF IT AS CHEAP AS I COULD WE WERE NOT A HAPPY COUPLE AND NOT A MISERABLE COUPLE WE WERE SIX OF ONE AND HALF A DOZEN OF THE OTHER
EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WITH THE HOUSE WITH NOTHING TO DO THE VERY PLACE FOR HIM
WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO COMES ON A VISIT TO HER MISTRESS'S HOUSE MATCH ME THAT IN THE WAY OF AN ABSURDITY OUT OF ANY STORY BOOK IN CHRISTENDOM IF YOU CAN I LAUGHED TILL THE TEARS ROLLED DOWN MY CHEEKS PENELOPE RESENTED MY MERRIMENT
AND SAYING I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT THE PERTURBATION IN MY MIND IN REGARD TO THINKING ABOUT IT BEING TRULY DREADFUL AFTER MY LADY HAD GONE AWAY I APPLIED THE REMEDY WHICH I HAVE NEVER YET FOUND TO FAIL ME
THERE I WAS IN CLOVER YOU WILL SAY
EIGHTY POUNDS A YEAR SNEERED THE ARCHDEACON AND THE PRECENTORSHIP SAID THE FATHER IN LAW IT GOES WITH THE WARDENSHIP SAID THE SON IN LAW MISTER HARDING WAS PREPARED TO ARGUE THIS POINT
FATHER SAYS PENELOPE QUITE SERIOUSLY THERE'S ONLY ONE EXPLANATION OF IT ROSANNA HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE AT FIRST SIGHT
AND YOU WILL NOT DO THIS RASH THING THE LADY WAS REALLY MOVED BEYOND HER USUAL CALM COMPOSURE IT CAN NEVER BE RASH TO DO RIGHT SAID HE I SHALL CERTAINLY
THE ARCHDEACON THOUGHT HE KNEW HIS FATHER IN LAW BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD ALREADY TALKED OVER A VACILLATING MAN TO RESIGN HIS PROMISE COME SAID HE PROMISE SUSAN TO GIVE UP THIS IDEA OF RESIGNING THE WARDENSHIP
WHAT IS ELEANOR TO DO IF YOU THROW AWAY YOUR INCOME A HOT TEAR STOOD IN EACH OF THE WARDEN'S EYES AS HE LOOKED ROUND UPON HIS MARRIED DAUGHTER WHY SHOULD ONE SISTER WHO WAS SO RICH PREDICT POVERTY FOR ANOTHER
THAT THE WAISTCOAT WAS NOT AN HONOUR BUT A BRIBE MY LADY HAD DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GETTING OLD
I MIGHT HAVE HAD A CHANCE OF CATCHING THEM BEFORE THEY GOT CLEAR OF OUR PREMISES AS IT WAS I WENT BACK TO SET A GOING A YOUNGER PAIR OF LEGS THAN MINE WITHOUT DISTURBING ANYBODY SAMUEL AND I GOT A COUPLE OF GUNS
WILL TAKE CARE OF ME ALSO SAID MISTER HARDING WITH A SMILE AS THOUGH AFRAID OF GIVING OFFENCE BY MAKING HIS REFERENCE TO SCRIPTURE TOO SOLEMN PISH SAID THE ARCHDEACON TURNING AWAY RAPIDLY
BUT PAPA WHAT DID YOU SAY TO SIR ABRAHAM ASKED THE LADY
AND ON THE DINGY SOFA BEHIND HIM RECLINED HIS PATIENT WIFE
HAVING GOT OVER MY DIFFICULTIES WITH THE LADIES I FOUND MORE DIFFICULTIES WAITING FOR ME WHEN I WENT BACK TO MY OWN ROOM IN CAME PENELOPE WITH THE NATURAL SWEETNESS OF WOMEN TO KISS AND MAKE IT UP AGAIN AND
AND HAD GONE OFF AGAIN ON HORSEBACK NEEDLESS ALSO TO SAY THAT THEY ASKED AWKWARD QUESTIONS DIRECTLY AND THAT THE FOREIGN POLITICS AND THE FALLING ASLEEP IN THE SUN WOULDN'T SERVE A SECOND TIME OVER WITH THEM BEING AT THE END OF MY INVENTION
BUT SUSAN DIDN'T WANT TO GO TILL HER HUSBAND WENT SHE HAD AN IDEA THAT HER PAPA MIGHT BE BULLIED IF SHE WERE AWAY SHE WASN'T TIRED AT ALL
I WENT ON WITH MY BUSINESS AS BAILIFF YEAR AFTER YEAR UP TO CHRISTMAS EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN WHEN THERE CAME A CHANGE IN MY LIFE ON THAT DAY MY LADY INVITED HERSELF TO A CUP OF TEA ALONE WITH ME IN MY COTTAGE SHE REMARKED THAT
TAKING UP A SIDE CANDLE AT ANY RATE YOU'LL PROMISE ME TO TAKE NO FURTHER STEP WITHOUT CONSULTATION SAID THE ARCHDEACON MISTER HARDING MADE NO ANSWER BUT SLOWLY PROCEEDED TO LIGHT HIS CANDLE
YOU HEAR MORE THAN ENOUGH OF MARRIED PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER MISERABLY HERE IS AN EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY LET IT BE A WARNING TO SOME OF YOU AND AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO OTHERS IN THE MEANTIME I WILL GO ON WITH MY STORY WELL
I NEVER KNEW YOU CRUEL BEFORE FATHER SHE SAID VERY GENTLY AND WENT OUT MY GIRL'S WORDS FELL UPON ME LIKE A SPLASH OF COLD WATER I WAS SAVAGE WITH MYSELF FOR FEELING
MY MIND BEGAN TO MISGIVE ME I HAVE COMPARED NOTES WITH OTHER MEN
THERE WAS A PAUSE FOR ABOUT A MINUTE AND THEN THE WARDEN FINDING THAT NOTHING ELSE WAS COMING LIGHTED HIS CANDLE AND QUIETLY SAID GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT PAPA SAID THE LADY
EXPRESS DISAPPROBATION AND ASTONISHMENT WHAT WILL SIR ABRAHAM THINK OF IT
A SORT OF WHISPER
IN THIS BUSINESS OF THE DIAMOND HE HAD THE LONGEST TONGUE AND THE SHORTEST TEMPER OF ANY MAN HIGH OR LOW I EVER MET WITH I SAY I WENT INTO THE SERVICE OF THE OLD LORD AS PAGE BOY IN WAITING ON THE THREE HONOURABLE YOUNG LADIES AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN YEARS
CAN BE IN ANY WAY BINDING ON YOU OF COURSE YOU WERE THERE TO ASK HIS ADVICE I'M SURE SIR ABRAHAM DID NOT ADVISE ANY SUCH STEP MISTER HARDING COULD NOT SAY THAT HE HAD I AM SURE HE DISADVISED YOU FROM IT
AND SO THE WARDEN RETIRED BUT AS HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM HE HEARD THE WELL KNOWN EJACULATION
AGAINST THE INDIGNITY OF TAKING MY EASE AS I COULD BUT MY MISTRESS KNEW THE WEAK SIDE OF ME SHE PUT IT AS A FAVOUR TO HERSELF THE DISPUTE BETWEEN US ENDED AFTER THAT IN MY WIPING MY EYES LIKE AN OLD FOOL WITH MY NEW WOOLLEN WAISTCOAT
THE WARDEN HUNG HIS HEAD AND MADE NO REPLY HE COULD NOT CONDESCEND TO SAY THAT HE HAD NOT INTENDED TO GIVE HIS SON IN LAW THE SLIP AND AS HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AVOW IT HE SAID NOTHING PAPA HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU
AND BEGAN TO DO SO BUT DOCTOR GRANTLY STOPPED HIM MY DEAR WARDEN SAID HE THIS IS ALL NONSENSE EIGHTY POUNDS OR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MAKES VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE YOU CAN'T LIVE ON IT YOU CAN'T RUIN ELEANOR'S PROSPECTS FOR EVER
ISN'T IT ASKED THE WARDEN INNOCENTLY WELL AT ANY RATE I'VE DONE IT NOW SIR ABRAHAM DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK IT SO VERY STRANGE THE ARCHDEACON GAVE A SIGH THAT WOULD HAVE MOVED A MAN OF WAR
THAT HAD EVER TRIED HIS TRAINING IN SERVICE LATER IN THE EVENING WE HEARD THEM SINGING AND PLAYING DUETS MISTER FRANKLIN PIPING HIGH MISS RACHEL PIPING HIGHER AND MY LADY ON THE PIANO FOLLOWING THEM AS IT WERE OVER HEDGE AND DITCH
UNEASY IN MYSELF THE MOMENT SHE HAD SPOKEN THEM BUT SO IT WAS WE WILL CHANGE THE SUBJECT IF YOU PLEASE I AM SORRY I DRIFTED INTO WRITING ABOUT IT AND NOT WITHOUT REASON
COULDN'T CHARGE FOR HER BOARD AND WOULD HAVE TO GIVE ME HER SERVICES FOR NOTHING THAT WAS THE POINT OF VIEW I LOOKED AT IT FROM ECONOMY WITH A DASH OF LOVE I PUT IT TO MY MISTRESS AS IN DUTY BOUND
OF COURSE CONTINUED THE OTHER SUCH A DECLARATION AS THAT YOU MADE TO SIR ABRAHAM MEANS NOTHING COME WARDEN PROMISE ME THIS THE WHOLE AFFAIR YOU SEE IS ALREADY SETTLED AND THAT WITH VERY LITTLE TROUBLE OR EXPENSE
THAT A STRANGE GENTLEMAN COULD POSSESS ANY INTEREST FOR HER
AND THE GALLERIES HAVE APPLAUDED WITH A COUPLE OF ROUNDS RESIGNED IT GOOD HEAVENS AND THE DIGNITARY OF THE CHURCH SANK BACK HORRIFIED INTO A HORSEHAIR ARM CHAIR AT LEAST
WELL I HAVE DONE MY DUTY IF HE CHOOSES TO RUIN HIS CHILD I CANNOT HELP IT AND HE STOOD STILL AT THE FIRE PLACE AND LOOKED AT HIMSELF IN A DINGY MIRROR WHICH STOOD ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE
I RECEIVED THIS MAGNIFICENT PRESENT QUITE AT A LOSS TO FIND WORDS TO THANK MY MISTRESS WITH FOR THE HONOUR SHE HAD DONE ME
IF THE RAVENS PERSISTED IN REFUSING THE FOOD PREPARED FOR THEM THEY WOULDN'T BE FED A CLERGYMAN GENERALLY DISLIKES TO BE MET IN ARGUMENT BY ANY SCRIPTURAL QUOTATION HE FEELS AS AFFRONTED AS
ASKED THE ARCHDEACON MISTER HARDING SIGNIFIED THAT HE HAD GOOD HEAVENS HOW UNFORTUNATE
WAS NOT IN HIS MIND A MATTER OF ANY DOUBT HE KNEW HIS OWN WEAKNESS HE KNEW HOW PRONE HE WAS TO BE LED BUT HE WAS NOT WEAK ENOUGH TO GIVE WAY NOW TO GO BACK FROM THE POSITION TO WHICH HIS CONSCIENCE HAD DRIVEN HIM
INSTEAD OF THAT I HAVE BEEN TELLING THE STORY OF MY OWN SELF CURIOUS AND QUITE BEYOND ME TO ACCOUNT FOR
SAID THE WARDEN AND TO PREVENT THAT CONTINUED THE OTHER WE MUSTN'T LET ANY TALK OF RESIGNATION GET ABROAD BUT I SHALL RESIGN SAID THE WARDEN VERY VERY MEEKLY GOOD HEAVENS
CHAPTER TWO I SPOKE OF MY LADY A LINE OR TWO BACK NOW THE DIAMOND COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN OUR HOUSE WHERE IT WAS LOST IF IT HAD NOT BEEN MADE A PRESENT OF TO MY LADY'S DAUGHTER AND MY LADY'S DAUGHTER
YOU KNOW YOU NEVER EXPECTED PAPA TO PAY THE COSTS SUCH ABSURDITY IS ENOUGH TO PROVOKE JOB SAID THE ARCHDEACON MARCHING QUICKLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM YOUR FATHER IS LIKE A CHILD EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR
AND SCRIBBLING MISTER FRANKLIN'S NAME INSIDE HER WORKBOX SHE HAD BEEN SURPRISED AGAIN CRYING AND LOOKING AT HER DEFORMED SHOULDER IN THE GLASS HAD SHE AND MISTER FRANKLIN KNOWN ANYTHING OF EACH OTHER BEFORE TO DAY QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
I CAN'T DO WITHOUT GABRIEL BETTEREDGE MY LADY SAYS SIR JOHN I CAN'T DO WITHOUT HIM EITHER THAT WAS HIS WAY WITH HER AND THAT WAS HOW I WENT INTO HIS SERVICE IT WAS ALL ONE TO ME WHERE I WENT
I CAME ON A COMFORTING BIT PAGE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT AS FOLLOWS
SO LONG AS MY MISTRESS AND I WERE TOGETHER SEEING THAT MY LADY TOOK AN INTEREST IN THE OUT OF DOOR WORK AND THE FARMS AND SUCH LIKE I TOOK AN INTEREST IN THEM TOO WITH ALL THE MORE REASON THAT I WAS A SMALL FARMER'S SEVENTH SON MYSELF
HOW DO YOU MEAN TO PAY THE MONSTROUS EXPENSES OF THIS ACTION MISSUS GRANTLY SUGGESTED THAT AS THE ACTION WAS ABANDONED THE COSTS WOULD NOT BE HEAVY INDEED THEY WILL MY DEAR CONTINUED HE
OH MAMMA DO THE PEOPLE HEREABOUTS KNOW I AM MARRIED TO DAY I WAS AFRAID THEY MIGHT NOT AND WE OVERTOOK WILLIAM GOULDING IN HIS CURRICLE
NO I PREFER TO THINK THAT COMRADE BICKERSDYKE REGARDS ME AS HIS FRIEND AND WELL WISHER AND WILL LEND A COURTEOUS EAR TO ANY PROPOSAL I SEE FIT TO MAKE I HOPE SHORTLY TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THIS TO YOU
LOST BUT A LITTLE OF THEIR SPIRIT IN THIS CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE WITH SUCH AN HUSBAND HER MISERY WAS CONSIDERED CERTAIN
BUT ALL IS NOT YET LOST YOU MUST RECOLLECT THAT COMRADE BICKERSDYKE SPOKE IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT THAT GENEROUS TEMPERAMENT WAS STIRRED TO ITS DEPTHS HE DID NOT PICK HIS WORDS BUT CALM WILL SUCCEED STORM AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING YET
NEUROTIC I CANNOT HAVE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM JOLTED AND DISORGANIZED IN THIS MANNER AND HIS VALUE AS A CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARY AND ADVISER IMPAIRED EVEN THOUGH IT BE ONLY TEMPORARILY I MUST LOOK INTO THIS I WILL GO AND SEE IF THE ORGY IS CONCLUDED
LOOK HERE SMITH SAID MIKE EARNESTLY FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T GO PLAYING THE GOAT THERE'S NO EARTHLY NEED FOR YOU TO GET LUGGED INTO THIS BUSINESS DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME I SHALL BE ALL RIGHT I THINK SAID PSMITH THAT YOU WILL
HAGGERSTON HAS OUR DIRECTIONS AND ALL WILL BE COMPLETED IN A WEEK THEY WILL THEN JOIN HIS REGIMENT UNLESS THEY ARE FIRST INVITED TO LONGBOURN AND I UNDERSTAND FROM MISSUS GARDINER THAT MY NIECE IS VERY DESIROUS OF SEEING YOU ALL BEFORE SHE LEAVES THE SOUTH
HE BEGGED TO KNOW FURTHER PARTICULARS OF WHAT HE WAS INDEBTED TO HIS BROTHER BUT WAS TOO ANGRY WITH LYDIA TO SEND ANY MESSAGE TO HER THE GOOD NEWS SPREAD QUICKLY THROUGH THE HOUSE AND WITH PROPORTIONATE SPEED THROUGH THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS BORNE IN THE LATTER WITH DECENT PHILOSOPHY
THOUGH I WAS THERE A FORTNIGHT NOT ONE PARTY OR SCHEME OR ANYTHING
WE ALL HAVE OUR HOBBIES SAID PSMITH JACKSON WASN'T SAYING MUCH HE JOLLY WELL HADN'T A CHANCE OLD BICK WAS SHOOTING IT OUT FOURTEEN TO THE DOZEN I HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED SAID PSMITH TO HEAR COMRADE BICKERSDYKE SPEAK BOTH IN HIS SANCTUM AND IN PUBLIC
WHAT WITH HER BOARD AND POCKET ALLOWANCE AND THE CONTINUAL PRESENTS IN MONEY WHICH PASSED TO HER THROUGH HER MOTHER'S HANDS LYDIA'S EXPENSES HAD BEEN VERY LITTLE WITHIN THAT SUM
IS REASSURING I MAY NOW THINK OF MY OWN TROUBLES COMRADE BRISTOW HAS BLOWN INTO THE OFFICE TODAY IN PATENT LEATHER BOOTS WITH WHITE KID UPPERS AS I BELIEVE THE TECHNICAL TERM IS ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT HE IS STILL WEARING THE SATIN TIE THE WAISTCOAT AND THE RING
WICKHAM WAS NOT AT ALL MORE DISTRESSED THAN HERSELF BUT HIS MANNERS WERE ALWAYS SO PLEASING THAT HAD HIS CHARACTER AND HIS MARRIAGE BEEN EXACTLY WHAT THEY OUGHT HIS SMILES AND HIS EASY ADDRESS
LOOK HERE SMITH HE SAID I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU I'M IN A BIT OF A HOLE
THE PLACE WAS FULL OF QUAINT CHARACTERS THERE WAS WEST WHO HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO LEAVE HAILEYBURY OWING TO HIS HABIT OF BORROWING HORSES AND ATTENDING MEETS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
MISTER DARCY REPEATED ELIZABETH
THIS WAS ONE POINT WITH REGARD TO LYDIA AT LEAST WHICH WAS NOW TO BE SETTLED AND MISTER BENNET COULD HAVE NO HESITATION IN ACCEDING TO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE HIM IN TERMS OF GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR THE KINDNESS OF HIS BROTHER THOUGH EXPRESSED MOST CONCISELY
THEIR SISTER'S WEDDING DAY ARRIVED AND JANE AND ELIZABETH FELT FOR HER PROBABLY MORE THAN SHE FELT FOR HERSELF THE CARRIAGE WAS SENT TO MEET THEM AT AND THEY WERE TO RETURN IN IT BY DINNER TIME THEIR ARRIVAL WAS DREADED BY THE ELDER MISS BENNETS AND JANE MORE ESPECIALLY
COMRADE B HAD TO LAY IT ON REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE IN AMERICA AS POSSIBLY YOU ARE AWARE THERE IS A REGULAR POST OF MISTAKE CLERK WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO RECEIVE IN THE NECK ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO BE COMING ALONG WHEN CUSTOMERS MAKE COMPLAINTS HE IS HAULED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE FOAMING CUSTOMER
THEY MUST ALL GO TO BRIGHTON THAT IS THE PLACE TO GET HUSBANDS WHAT A PITY IT IS MAMMA WE DID NOT ALL GO VERY TRUE AND IF I HAD MY WILL WE SHOULD BUT MY DEAR LYDIA I DON'T AT ALL LIKE YOUR GOING SUCH A WAY OFF MUST IT BE SO
THE PRINCIPAL PURPORT OF HIS LETTER WAS TO INFORM THEM THAT MISTER WICKHAM HAD RESOLVED ON QUITTING THE MILITIA IT WAS GREATLY MY WISH THAT HE SHOULD DO SO HE ADDED AS SOON AS HIS MARRIAGE WAS FIXED ON
MISTER WALLER STILL CHIRPY HAD NOTHING BUT GOOD NEWS OF EDWARD MIKE WENT FOR HIS MORNING STROLL ROUND THE OFFICE FEELING THAT THINGS HAD SETTLED DOWN AND HAD MADE UP THEIR MIND TO RUN SMOOTHLY WHEN HE GOT BACK BARELY HALF AN HOUR LATER THE STORM HAD BURST
HE'S GOT THE HUMP ABOUT SOMETHING HE'S SITTING THERE LOOKING ABSOLUTELY FED UP WITH THINGS I HOPE THERE'S NOTHING UP HE'S NOT A BAD SORT IT WOULD BE ROT IF ANYTHING ROTTEN'S HAPPENED PSMITH BEGAN TO DISPLAY A GENTLE INTEREST
PSMITH ROSE MIKE LED THE WAY TO A QUIET CORNER OF THE TELEGRAMS DEPARTMENT I TELL YOU COMRADE JACKSON SAID PSMITH I AM HARD PRESSED THE FIGHT IS BEGINNING TO BE TOO MUCH FOR ME
APPLIES FOR A RISE OF SALARY NOW POSSIBLY IN YOUR CASE IN MY CASE INTERRUPTED MIKE THERE WAS NONE OF THAT ROT BICKERSDYKE WASN'T PUTTING IT ON HE MEANT EVERY WORD
WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TURMOIL I COULDN'T WAIT TO HEAR I WAS TOO JOLLY GLAD TO GET AWAY OLD BICK LOOKED AT ME AS IF HE COULD EAT ME
BUT HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THE FACT ROUND WHICH IT REVOLVED
HE WAS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED THAT A CAUSE OF SO LITTLE ADVANTAGE TO ANYONE SHOULD BE FORWARDED AT THE SOLE EXPENSE OF HIS BROTHER IN LAW
FOCUSING HIS ATTENTION WITH SOME RELUCTANCE UPON THIS BLOT ON THE HORIZON HE DISCOVERED THAT THE EXPLOITER OF RAINBOW WAISTCOATS AND SATIN TIES WAS ADDRESSING HIM I SAY SMITHY SAID BRISTOW HE SPOKE IN RATHER AN AWED VOICE
BUT TO LIVE IN IGNORANCE ON SUCH A POINT WAS IMPOSSIBLE OR AT LEAST IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO TRY FOR INFORMATION
WHAT MY CURIOSITY MUST BE TO KNOW HOW A PERSON UNCONNECTED WITH ANY OF US AND COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING A STRANGER TO OUR FAMILY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AMONGST YOU AT SUCH A TIME PRAY WRITE INSTANTLY AND LET ME UNDERSTAND IT
AS SOON AS HE SHOULD BE OF AGE AND THE WIDOW AND YOUNGER CHILDREN WOULD BY THAT MEANS BE PROVIDED FOR
THERE WAS A CURIOUSLY GREY TIRED LOOK ON HIS FACE MIKE COULD NOT MAKE IT OUT
FOR WHICH I HAVE PLEDGED MYSELF AND WILL YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE OF CARRYING SIMILAR ASSURANCES TO HIS CREDITORS IN MERYTON OF WHOM I SHALL SUBJOIN A LIST ACCORDING TO HIS INFORMATION HE HAS GIVEN IN ALL HIS DEBTS I HOPE AT LEAST HE HAS NOT DECEIVED US
OH IT'S HARD I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT ON ANY OTHER DAY BUT THAT I COULD NOT HAVE MISSED IT THEY SHOWED ME THE CHEQUE IN THERE JUST NOW I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I HAD PASSED IT I DON'T REMEMBER DOING IT MY MIND WAS FAR AWAY I DON'T REMEMBER THE CHEQUE OR ANYTHING ABOUT IT
AND CENTRED AND SANDY TURNBULL HEADED A BEAUTIFUL GOAL
THE HEAD OF THE CASH DEPARTMENT WAS AS A RULE MILDLY CHEERFUL ON ARRIVAL AND APT EXCESSIVELY MIKE THOUGHT THOUGH HE ALWAYS LISTENED WITH POLITE INTEREST TO RELATE THE MOST RECENT SAYINGS AND DOINGS OF HIS SNUB NOSED SON EDWARD
AND THERE WAS MY AUNT
SHE IS WELL AND BEGS TO BE DUTIFULLY REMEMBERED TO YOU AND YOUR MOTHER YOURS ET CETERA E GARDINER MISTER BENNET AND HIS DAUGHTERS SAW ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF WICKHAM'S REMOVAL FROM THE SHIRE
SMILING THE CASHIER DID NOT NOTICE THE MOVEMENT SOMEBODY HAD COME IN TO CASH A CHEQUE AND HE WAS WORKING MECHANICALLY
PSMITH STIRRED HIS COFFEE BEFORE REPLYING
HE THEN DELIVERED ON PAPER HIS PERFECT APPROBATION OF ALL THAT WAS DONE
BUT NO SUCH HAPPY MARRIAGE COULD NOW TEACH THE ADMIRING MULTITUDE WHAT CONNUBIAL FELICITY REALLY WAS
HE WENT ABOUT HIS DUTIES IN A COSTUME WHICH SUGGESTED THE SPORTSMAN OF THE COMIC PAPERS THERE WAS ALSO HIGNETT WHO ADDED TO THE MEAGRE SALARY ALLOWED HIM BY THE BANK BY SINGING COMIC SONGS AT THE MINOR MUSIC HALLS
WHO BELIEVED THAT THE EARTH WAS FLAT AND ADDRESSED MEETINGS ON THE SUBJECT IN HYDE PARK ON SUNDAYS AND MANY OTHERS
HE RECOLLECTED THE MAN WHO HAD PRESENTED IT A TALLISH MAN WITH A BEARD
NOT HOWEVER FROM ANY FEAR OF DISADVANTAGE FROM IT INDIVIDUALLY TO HERSELF FOR AT ANY RATE THERE SEEMED A GULF IMPASSABLE BETWEEN THEM
BUT ON THIS HAPPY DAY SHE AGAIN TOOK HER SEAT AT THE HEAD OF HER TABLE AND IN SPIRITS OPPRESSIVELY HIGH
COULD BE SPUN OUT FROM HALF PAST TWELVE TO TWO MORE WORK FROM TWO TILL HALF PAST THREE FROM HALF PAST THREE TILL HALF PAST FOUR TEA IN THE TEAROOM WITH A NOVEL
HIS LETTER WAS SOON DISPATCHED FOR THOUGH DILATORY IN UNDERTAKING BUSINESS
THAT WAS AT TEN O'CLOCK FROM TEN TO ELEVEN HE WOULD POTTER THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON AT THAT TIME IN HIS DEPARTMENT
ALL HE COULD UNDERSTAND WAS THAT A FAR WORSE THING HAD HAPPENED THAN ANYTHING HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED A FORGERY HE SAID A FORGERY AND A CLUMSY ONE
BUT IF I FIND AS I SUSPECT THAT HE HAS WRONGED COMRADE JACKSON I SHALL BE FORCED TO SPEAK SHARPLY TO HIM MIKE HAD LEFT THE SCENE OF BATTLE BY THE TIME PSMITH REACHED THE CASH DEPARTMENT
WHY HE SAID IT WAS A FORGERY MUTTERED MISTER WALLER SITTING DOWN HEAVILY MIKE COULD NOT TAKE IT IN ALL AT ONCE HE WAS STUNNED
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT THEY WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS AT HOME UP TILL NOW THE MATTER HAD SEEMED ENTIRELY A PERSONAL ONE
AND WENT IN THE MANAGER WAS IN HIS CHAIR AT THE BIG TABLE OPPOSITE HIM
GAVE HER HAND WITH AN AFFECTIONATE SMILE TO WICKHAM WHO FOLLOWED HIS LADY AND WISHED THEM BOTH JOY WITH AN ALACRITY WHICH SHEWED NO DOUBT OF THEIR HAPPINESS THEIR RECEPTION FROM MISTER BENNET TO WHOM THEY THEN TURNED WAS NOT QUITE SO CORDIAL HIS COUNTENANCE RATHER GAINED IN AUSTERITY
MY UNCLE AND AUNT AND I WERE TO GO TOGETHER AND THE OTHERS WERE TO MEET US AT THE CHURCH WELL MONDAY MORNING CAME AND I WAS IN SUCH A FUSS I WAS SO AFRAID YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO PUT IT OFF
I THINK THERE CANNOT BE TOO LITTLE SAID ON THE SUBJECT LA
AND THE CASHIER PUTTING ON HIS COAT AND HAT PASSED SILENTLY OUT THROUGH THE SWING DOORS HE WALKED LISTLESSLY HE WAS EVIDENTLY TIRED OUT MIKE SHUT HIS LEDGER WITH A VICIOUS BANG AND WENT ACROSS TO FIND PSMITH HE WAS GLAD THE DAY WAS OVER
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG MEN TOO THAT SHE LIKES VERY MUCH THE OFFICERS MAY NOT BE SO PLEASANT IN GENERAL REGIMENT HIS DAUGHTER'S REQUEST FOR SUCH IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED OF BEING ADMITTED INTO HER FAMILY AGAIN BEFORE SHE SET OFF FOR THE NORTH
THE HAPPY THOUGHT STRUCK HIM OF CONSULTING PSMITH IT WAS HIS HOUR FOR POTTERING
BLOOMING HURRICANE MORE LIKE IT I WAS IN BICK'S ROOM JUST NOW WITH A LETTER TO SIGN AND I TELL YOU THE FUR WAS FLYING ALL OVER THE BALLY SHOP
EDWARD IT APPEARED HAD RALLIED IN THE AFTERNOON
AND HER HUSBAND'S LOVE OF INDEPENDENCE HAD ALONE PREVENTED THEIR EXCEEDING THEIR INCOME FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS WAS SETTLED BY MARRIAGE ARTICLES ON MISSUS BENNET AND THE CHILDREN BUT IN WHAT PROPORTIONS IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED AMONGST THE LATTER DEPENDED ON THE WILL OF THE PARENTS
BEEN LED TO MAKE MISTER DARCY ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR FEARS FOR HER SISTER FOR SINCE HER MARRIAGE WOULD SO SHORTLY GIVE THE PROPER TERMINATION TO THE ELOPEMENT
MIKE FOUND HIMSELF BY DEGREES GROWING QUITE ATTACHED TO THE NEW ASIATIC BANK ONE MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY
MISTER WICKHAM HAD RECEIVED HIS COMMISSION BEFORE HE LEFT LONDON AND HE WAS TO JOIN HIS REGIMENT AT THE END OF A FORTNIGHT NO ONE BUT MISSUS BENNET REGRETTED THAT THEIR STAY WOULD BE SO SHORT AND SHE MADE THE MOST OF THE TIME BY VISITING ABOUT WITH HER DAUGHTER AND HAVING VERY FREQUENT PARTIES AT HOME
THE LITTLE THEATRE WAS OPEN WELL AND SO JUST AS THE CARRIAGE CAME TO THE DOOR MY
EXCEEDED ALL SHE COULD BELIEVE POSSIBLE
I REGRET TO SEE YOU STILL FLAUNT IF IT IS ONE TITHE AS PAINFUL AS THAT YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHY JERK IT OUT COMRADE BRISTOW
HE IS FURIOUS MISTER BICKERSDYKE TOO THEY ARE BOTH FURIOUS I SHALL BE DISMISSED I SHALL LOSE MY PLACE I SHALL BE DISMISSED HE WAS TALKING MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO MIKE IT WAS DREADFUL TO SEE HIM SITTING THERE ALL LIMP AND BROKEN
SHE TURNED FROM SISTER TO SISTER DEMANDING THEIR CONGRATULATIONS AND WHEN AT LENGTH THEY ALL SAT DOWN LOOKED EAGERLY ROUND THE ROOM
NOBODY WILL TAKE AN OLD MAN LIKE ME HIS VOICE DIED AWAY THERE WAS A SILENCE MIKE SAT STARING MISERABLY IN FRONT OF HIM THEN QUITE SUDDENLY AN IDEA CAME TO HIM
FOR THESE HE WAS PREPARED WHAT HE DID NOT EXPECT WAS ANY BIG CALAMITY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF IT THE SKY WAS BLUE AND FREE FROM ALL SUGGESTIONS OF APPROACHING THUNDERBOLTS
AND JANE TOOK A VERY LITTLE COURAGE AS SHE REMEMBERED THAT SUNSET COULDN'T BE FAR OFF NOW THE MOAT IS DREADFULLY THIN SAID ANTHEA BUT THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE CASTLE EVEN IF THEY DO SWIM OVER
THE PUDDING WAS FORTUNATELY
FEW INTREPID SURVIVORS THAT'S US
PAINFUL SCENE IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THEY ALL HAD ENOUGH MUTTON AND THAT WHEN MARTHA CAME TO CHANGE THE PLATES SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A MESS IN ALL HER BORN DAYS
THEN ROBERT SPRANG SOFTLY TO THE DOOR HE PULLED OFF HIS SHOES
BECAUSE HE KNEW THIS WAS FOR A BATTERING RAM WHAT A GOOD THING WE'VE GOT A MOAT HE SAID AND WHAT A GOOD THING THE DRAWBRIDGE IS UP I SHOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN HOW TO WORK IT OF COURSE IT WOULD BE UP IN A BESIEGED CASTLE
JANE PLEADED I DON'T BELIEVE THE SUN'S GOING TO SET TO NIGHT AT ALL
WAS GETTING RATHER DARK IN THE ROOM ABOVE THE GREAT
WHY SHOULD IT ASKED ROBERT WATER'S WATER ALL THE WORLD OVER
WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHICH OF YOU IS THE BRAVEST I THINK CYRIL WAS A PERFECT SILLY TO WISH FOR A CASTLE
ALL GONE AND THERE WAS THE GARDEN WITH ITS TANGLE OF DAHLIAS AND MARIGOLDS AND ASTERS AND LATE ROSES AND THE SPIKY IRON RAILINGS AND THE QUIET WHITE ROAD EVERYONE
SO A HEAP OF STONES GREW APACE UP IN THE ROOM ABOVE THE GATE AND ANOTHER HEAP A SHINY SPIKY DANGEROUS LOOKING HEAP OF DAGGERS AND KNIVES
YOU CAN'T HELP IT IF YOU ARE POURING WATER ON A BESIEGING FOE AND YOUR CASTLE SUDDENLY CHANGES INTO YOUR HOUSE
AND COULD SEE TOO THAT BEYOND THE MOAT ON EVERY SIDE THE TENTS OF THE BESIEGING PARTY WERE PITCHED
HE PEEPED INTO THE UPPER ROOM THE MAN WAS THERE AND IT WAS JAKIN ALL DRIPPING WITH MOAT WATER AND HE WAS FIDDLING ABOUT WITH THE MACHINERY WHICH ROBERT FELT SURE WORKED THE DRAWBRIDGE ROBERT BANGED THE DOOR SUDDENLY
A NEW CAP AND EVERYTHING SHE FLOUNCED OUT AMID A DISREGARDED CHORUS OF REGRETS AND APOLOGIES THE CHILDREN WERE VERY SORRY BUT REALLY IT WAS NOT THEIR FAULTS
THINKING OF THE BISCUITS WHO PUTS MUTTON IN THEIR POCKETS GOOSE GIRL SAID CYRIL BUT I KNOW AT ANY RATE I'LL TRY IT HE LEANED OVER THE TABLE WITH HIS FACE ABOUT AN
THAT'S THAT BEAST JAKIN SAID ROBERT THERE'S STILL THE PORTCULLIS I'M ALMOST CERTAIN THAT'S WORKED FROM LOWER DOWN AND NOW THE DRAWBRIDGE RANG AND ECHOED HOLLOWLY TO THE HOOFS OF HORSES
AND NOW EVERYONE FELT MORE COURAGE TO PREPARE FOR THE ATTACK THAT WAS TO BE DELIVERED BEFORE SUNSET ROBERT AS CAPTAIN INSISTED ON CLIMBING TO THE TOP OF ONE OF THE TOWERS TO RECONNOITRE SO UP THEY ALL WENT
AND THE TRAMP OF ARMED MEN UP QUICK CRIED ROBERT LET'S DROP THINGS ON THEM EVEN THE GIRLS WERE FEELING ALMOST BRAVE NOW THEY FOLLOWED ROBERT QUICKLY AND UNDER HIS DIRECTIONS
AND AGAIN THE RAM BATTERED THE GREAT DOOR ANTHEA PAUSED
IT IS REAL SAID ROBERT AND THEY ARE GOING TO ATTACK ALL RUSHED TO THE NARROW WINDOWS YES SAID ROBERT
A MAN WHO WAS WITH THE TRUMPETER SHOUTED WHAT HO WITHIN THERE AND
ANYONE SHOULD FEEL FAINT IN STRESS OF BATTLE
IT ISN'T ROBERT WAS BEGINNING STERNLY BUT ANTHEA INTERRUPTED OH YES YOU DO SHE SAID COAXINGLY IT'S A VERY NICE GAME REALLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY GET IN AND IF THEY DO
I THOUGHT WE COULDN'T GET THROUGH A WISH DAY WITHOUT A ROW SAID CYRIL IT WAS MUCH TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE COME ON BOBS MY MILITARY HERO IF WE LICK INTO BED SHARP SHE WON'T BE SO FRUMIOUS AND PERHAPS SHE'LL BONG US UP SOME SUPPER
IT WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER THERE WAS A CREAKING ABOVE AND SOMETHING RATTLED AND SHOOK THE PAVEMENT THEY STOOD ON SEEMED TO TREMBLE THEN A CRASH TOLD THEM THAT THE DRAWBRIDGE HAD BEEN LOWERED TO ITS PLACE
THIS IS THE VERY FIRST THING WE'VE WISHED FOR THAT HASN'T GOT US INTO A ROW AND THERE HASN'T BEEN THE LEAST LITTLE SCRAP OF A ROW ABOUT THIS NOBODY'S RAGING DOWNSTAIRS WE'RE SAFE AND SOUND
IN THE GATE TOWER HERE I THINK I'M GLAD IT'S ONLY A GAME IT IS ONLY A GAME ISN'T IT SAID JANE BUT NO ONE ANSWERED
FOR NOBODY LOOKS NICE PICKING UP SLICES OF SUET PUDDING FROM THE TABLE IN ITS MOUTH LIKE A DOG THE GREAT THING AFTER ALL
AND TRY TO GET UP BETTER CHILDREN IN THE MORNING NOW THEN DON'T LET ME HAVE TO TELL YOU TWICE IF I FIND ANY OF YOU NOT IN BED IN TEN MINUTES
THE NEXT MOMENT ALL THE OTHERS WERE FOLLOWING HIS EXAMPLE AND OPENING AND SHUTTING THEIR MOUTHS AN INCH OR SO FROM THE BARE LOOKING TABLE ROBERT CAPTURED A
BISCUITS THREE WHOLE ONES AND A GENEROUS HANDFUL OF CRUMBS AND FRAGMENTS I GOT THEM THIS MORNING COOK AND I'D QUITE FORGOTTEN HE EXPLAINED AS HE DIVIDED THEM WITH SCRUPULOUS FAIRNESS INTO FOUR HEAPS
WITH A SINGLE GROWN UP THE DOOR WAS OPENED SUDDENLY AND FIERCELY YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES SAID THE VOICE OF MARTHA
PUT MINE IN MY POCKET PLEASE MY HANDS ARE SO DIRTY AND I'LL TELL THE OTHERS TO FETCH THEIRS THIS WAS INDEED A HAPPY THOUGHT FOR NOW WITH FOUR GENEROUS HANDFULS OF AIR WHICH TURNED TO BISCUIT AS MARTHA CRAMMED IT INTO THEIR POCKETS
JUST PLAIN PLEASE THEY SAID MARTHA SAID WELL I NEVER WHAT NEXT I WONDER AND WENT AWAY THEN ENSUED ANOTHER SCENE ON WHICH I WILL NOT DWELL
THE SAME AS OURS IN THE STABLE YARD SAID JANE
AND ALL THE PROVISIONS EATEN AND NOW
AS CYRIL SAID ARMED HEAVILY FOR THESE SWORDS AND LANCES AND CROSSBOWS WERE FAR TOO WEIGHTY EVEN FOR CYRIL'S MANLY STRENGTH AND AS FOR THE LONGBOWS NONE OF THE CHILDREN COULD EVEN BEGIN TO BEND THEM THE DAGGERS WERE BETTER
AND CALLING TO CYRIL TO LEND A HAND THEN THEY STOOD IN THE ARCHED GATE HOUSE BREATHING HARD AND LOOKING AT EACH OTHER JANE'S MOUTH WAS OPEN CHEER UP JENNY SAID ROBERT
THE MOAT AND THE TENTS
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY AT BESIEGED CASTLES
AND THE LITTLE ROOM WAS ALMOST QUITE DARK WE'VE HELD IT CRIED ROBERT WE WON'T SURRENDER THE SUN MUST SET IN A MINUTE HERE THEY'RE ALL JAWING UNDERNEATH AGAIN PITY THERE'S NO TIME TO GET MORE STONES HERE POUR THAT WATER DOWN ON THEM
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL AND TAKING THE POT FROM ANTHEA POURED THE WATER OUT THROUGH THE ARROW SLIT AND AS HE BEGAN TO POUR THE NOISE OF THE BATTERING RAM AND THE TRAMPLING OF THE FOE AND THE SHOUTS OF
BIG FRONT BEDROOM OF THEIR OWN HOUSE
IT'S NO GOOD SAID ROBERT IN DEEP DEJECTION YOU'LL ONLY HULLO CYRIL STOOD UP WITH A GRIN OF TRIUMPH HOLDING A SQUARE PIECE OF BREAD IN HIS MOUTH IT WAS QUITE REAL EVERYONE SAW IT
I DON'T KNOW SAID CYRIL AFTER A PAUSE UNLESS IT'S BECAUSE WE HAD THEM
THEY LOOKED AT ROBERT WITH SURPRISED RESPECT ANTHEA SAID YOU REALLY ARE BRAVE ROBERT ROT CYRIL'S PALLOR TURNED TO REDNESS NOW ALL IN A MINUTE
DEFENDING TO THE DEATH I MEAN ASKED ANTHEA WE OUGHT TO BE HEAVILY ARMED AND THEN SHOOT AT THEM WHEN THEY ADVANCE TO THE ATTACK
SHE ADDED HASTILY AND JANE AS WELL AND WE HAVEN'T GOT INTO
HULLO THERE ROBERT BELLOWED BACK AT ONCE IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD THE KING AND OF OUR GOOD LORD AND TRUSTY LEADER SIR WULFRIC DE TALBOT WE SUMMON THIS CASTLE TO SURRENDER ON PAIN OF FIRE AND SWORD AND NO QUARTER
THEY USED TO POUR BOILING LEAD DOWN ON BESIEGERS WHEN THEY GOT TOO CLOSE SAID ANTHEA FATHER SHOWED ME THE HOLES ON PURPOSE FOR POURING IT DOWN THROUGH AT BODIAM CASTLE AND THERE ARE HOLES LIKE IT
THEY WERE EATEN IN A HAPPY SILENCE THOUGH THEY TASTED A LITTLE ODDLY
THE MAN ANSWERED BACK
IT WAS JUST LIKE A SPLENDID COLOURED PICTURE THE TRUMPETS WERE SOUNDING AND WHEN THE TRUMPETS STOPPED FOR BREATH
CLEANING OR SHARPENING THEIR ARMS RE STRINGING THEIR BOWS AND POLISHING THEIR SHIELDS A LARGE PARTY CAME ALONG THE ROAD WITH HORSES DRAGGING ALONG THE GREAT TRUNK OF A TREE AND CYRIL FELT QUITE PALE
IT IS TRUE THAT DIRECTLY HE BIT A PIECE OFF THE REST VANISHED
AS ANTHEA WAS CROSSING THE COURTYARD FOR MORE STONES A SUDDEN AND VALUABLE IDEA CAME TO HER SHE WENT TO MARTHA AND SAID
I'D GIVE SOMETHING FOR A JOLLY GOOD BOILING KETTLE OF LEAD
OF COURSE THEY ARE ANTHEA POINTED CHEERFULLY THROUGH THE NARROW WINDOW
OH DEAR SAID JANE DON'T YOU THINK WE'D BETTER SURRENDER NEVER SAID ROBERT WE'LL HAVE A PARLEY IF YOU LIKE BUT WE'LL NEVER SURRENDER
A TRUMPETER CAME FORWARD TO THE EDGE OF THE MOAT WHICH NOW SEEMED VERY MUCH NARROWER THAN AT FIRST
LYING FLAT ON THE FLOOR AND PUTTING ONE EYE TO THE LEAD HOLE OF COURSE THE HOLES GO STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE GATE HOUSE THAT'S FOR WHEN THE ENEMY HAS GOT PAST THE DOOR AND THE PORTCULLIS AND ALMOST ALL IS LOST HERE HAND ME THE POT
THERE WAS A CONFUSED NOISE BELOW AND SOME GROANS OH DEAR
THE GARRISON WAS WELL PROVISIONED TILL SUNDOWN THEY BROUGHT UP SOME IRON POTS OF COLD WATER TO POUR ON THE BESIEGERS INSTEAD OF HOT LEAD WITH WHICH THE CASTLE DID NOT SEEM TO BE PROVIDED
I'M AFRAID WE'VE HURT SOMEBODY ROBERT CAUGHT UP THE STONE IN A FURY I SHOULD
I SAY THERE ARE LOTS OF STONES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COURTYARD IF WE TOOK SOME OF THOSE UP JUST TO DROP ON THEIR HEADS
BUT JANE HOPED THAT THE BESIEGERS WOULD NOT COME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR DAGGERS TO BE OF ANY USE NEVER MIND WE CAN HURL THEM LIKE JAVELINS SAID CYRIL OR DROP THEM ON PEOPLE'S HEADS
MARTHA HAD BROUGHT IN THE DINNER AND THE DINNER WAS INVISIBLE AND UNFEELABLE TOO
HEAVY FEET AND THE CLANK OF STEEL NO ONE BREATHED FOR A MOMENT THE STEEL
AND TURNED THE GREAT KEY IN THE LOCK JUST AS JAKIN SPRANG TO THE INSIDE OF THE DOOR
WOULDN'T YOU SAID ROBERT YOU SEE
DREW A DEEP BREATH AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID ROBERT I TOLD YOU SO AND I SAY WE DIDN'T SURRENDER DID WE
A SIEGE AND BED THE CHILDREN WERE SITTING IN THE GLOOMY BANQUETING HALL AT THE END OF ONE OF THE LONG BARE WOODEN TABLES THERE WAS NOW NO HOPE
I THINK I AM NOW SAID ANTHEA SLOWLY BUT I WOULDN'T WISH FOR IT AGAIN I THINK SQUIRREL DEAR OH IT WAS SIMPLY SPLENDID SAID JANE UNEXPECTEDLY I WASN'T FRIGHTENED A BIT
AND DE TALBOT FOR EVER ALL SUDDENLY STOPPED AND WENT OUT LIKE THE SNUFF OF A CANDLE THE LITTLE DARK ROOM SEEMED TO WHIRL ROUND AND TURN TOPSY TURVY AND WHEN THE CHILDREN CAME TO THEMSELVES
I'M JOLLY HUNGRY GOOD NIGHT KIDS GOOD NIGHT I HOPE THE CASTLE WON'T COME CREEPING BACK IN THE NIGHT SAID JANE OF COURSE IT WON'T SAID ANTHEA BRISKLY
THEN IF WE HAD THE MUTTON IT WOULD BE REAL SAID ROBERT OH DON'T I WISH WE COULD FIND IT BUT WE CAN'T FIND IT I SUPPOSE IT ISN'T OURS TILL WE'VE GOT IT IN OUR MOUTHS
TO THE OTHERS WHO HAD ONLY SEEN THE CAMP AND THE BESIEGERS FROM A DISTANCE THE WHOLE THING SEEMED HALF A GAME OF MAKE BELIEVE AND HALF A SPLENDIDLY DISTINCT AND PERFECTLY SAFE DREAM
IN ACT OF PRESENTING THE TIN WOODMAN WITH A HEART COVERED ALMOST ONE ENTIRE END OF THE ROOM WHILE THE VISITORS GAZED AT THESE THINGS IN SILENT ADMIRATION THEY SUDDENLY HEARD A LOUD VOICE IN THE NEXT ROOM EXCLAIM
I WAS PROUD OF MY GREAT SIZE AND REALIZED THAT NOW I COULD SAFELY TRAVEL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHILE MY SUPERIOR CULTURE WOULD MAKE ME A FIT ASSOCIATE FOR THE MOST LEARNED PERSON I MIGHT CHANCE TO MEET SO WHILE THE PROFESSOR PICKED THE LITTLE GIRLS
BUT TIME IS PRECIOUS JUST NOW SO LET US QUICKLY MAKE PREPARATIONS TO START UPON OUR JOURNEY THE EMPEROR CALLED HIS LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR AND INSTRUCTED HIM HOW TO RUN THE KINGDOM DURING HIS ABSENCE MEANWHILE THE SCARECROW WAS TAKEN APART
AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE FACED THEM WITH A MORE CHEERFUL EXPRESSION UPON HIS PAINTED FACE WHERE IS THE SAW HORSE YOU RODE HERE HE ASKED THE PUMPKINHEAD
THEY SURELY DO NOT COMPLAIN OF YOUR WISE AND GRACIOUS RULE NO BUT THEY SAY IT IS A POOR RULE THAT DON'T WORK BOTH WAYS ANSWERED THE SCARECROW AND THESE FEMALES ARE ALSO OF THE OPINION THAT MEN HAVE RULED THE LAND LONG ENOUGH
TAILORS HAVING LIKE CATS NINE LIVES AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE FELLOW WAS EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL FOR HAD HE LOST THAT NINTH LIFE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIM SO HE BEGGED PERMISSION TO FURNISH ME WITH THE STYLISH COSTUME I NOW WEAR
SO HE BEGGED HIS FRIENDS TO EXCUSE HIM WHILE HE RETIRED TO HIS PRIVATE APARTMENT AND ALLOWED HIS SERVANTS TO POLISH HIM THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN A SHORT TIME AND WHEN THE EMPEROR RETURNED HIS NICKEL PLATED BODY SHONE SO MAGNIFICENTLY
THAT THE SCARECROW HEARTILY CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS IMPROVED APPEARANCE THAT NICKEL PLATE WAS I CONFESS A HAPPY THOUGHT SAID NICK
TIP DURING THIS CONVERSATION WAS LOOKING AT THE WOODMAN WITH UNDISGUISED AMAZEMENT AND NOTICED THAT THE CELEBRATED EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES WAS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF PIECES OF TIN
THE TIN WOODMAN LOOKED AROUND HIM IN A PUZZLED WAY FOR THE SAW HORSE HAD UNTIL NOW REMAINED QUIETLY STANDING IN A CORNER WHERE THE EMPEROR HAD NOT NOTICED HIM TIP IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE ODD LOOKING CREATURE TO THEM
SUGGESTED TIP I CAN'T SAID THE SCARECROW WHY NOT YOU'VE A MOUTH HAVEN'T YOU ASKED THE BOY YES BUT MY MOUTH IS PAINTED ON AND THERE'S NO SWALLOW CONNECTED WITH IT ANSWERED THE SCARECROW IN FACT HE CONTINUED
THIS THE SCARECROW TRIED TO DO BUT HIS PADDED GLOVES WERE TOO CLUMSY TO CLUTCH SO SMALL AN OBJECT AND HE HELD THE BOX TOWARD THE BOY WHILE TIP SELECTED ONE OF THE PILLS AND SWALLOWED IT COUNT CRIED THE SCARECROW
THE MOST STUPID OF THE ENTIRE PARTY YOU MAKE ME QUITE ASHAMED OF MYSELF SAID THE SCARECROW BOWING LOW TO THE SAW HORSE NEVERTHELESS THE CREATURE IS RIGHT DECLARED THE WOGGLE BUG
HAS LATELY CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE NICKEL PLATED GOOD GRACIOUS THE SCARECROW EXCLAIMED AT HEARING THIS IF HIS WIT BEARS THE SAME POLISH HOW SPARKLING IT MUST BE BUT SHOW US IN
AND THIS CROWN IS SO HEAVY THAT IT MAKES MY HEAD ACHE BUT I HOPE THE CONQUERORS HAVE NO INTENTION OF INJURING ME JUST BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE THE KING I HEARD THEM SAY REMARKED TIP WITH SOME HESITATION THAT THEY
PROFESSOR NOWITALL IS DOUBTLESS THE MOST FAMOUS SCHOLAR IN THE LAND OF OZ AND AFTER A FEW DAYS I BEGAN TO LISTEN TO THE LECTURES AND DISCOURSES HE GAVE HIS PUPILS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS MORE ATTENTIVE THAN THE HUMBLE UNNOTICED WOGGLE BUG
WHICH SMARTED FOR AN HOUR AFTERWARD BUT THE NEEDLES HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE SCARECROW OR JACK PUMPKINHEAD WHO NEVER EVEN SUSPECTED THEY WERE BEING PRODDED AS FOR THE SAW HORSE HE MADE A WONDERFUL RECORD UPSETTING A FRUIT CART
I RESOLVED TO ESTABLISH MY FUTURE HOME BESIDE IT SO I FOUND A CHARMING NEST BETWEEN TWO BRICKS AND HID MYSELF THEREIN FOR MANY MANY MONTHS
AS COOLLY AS IF NO DANGER THREATENED HIS THRONE BUT THE PUMPKINHEAD HAVING CAUGHT SIGHT OF TIP AMBLED TOWARD THE BOY AS FAST AS HIS WOODEN LEGS WOULD GO GOOD AFTERNOON NOBLE PARENT HE CRIED DELIGHTEDLY
THAT INSECTS WORE CLOTHES NOR DO THEY IN THEIR NATURAL STATE RETURNED THE STRANGER BUT IN THE COURSE OF MY WANDERINGS I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SAVE THE NINTH LIFE OF A TAILOR
THE FLUTTER OF THESE GREAT WINGS FILLED THE JACKDAWS WITH TERROR AND WHEN THE GUMP
REPLIED THE SOLDIER STILL PALE WITH FEAR BUT WHERE WAS MY STANDING ARMY AT THE TIME INQUIRED HIS MAJESTY LOOKING AT THE SOLDIER GRAVELY YOUR STANDING ARMY WAS RUNNING ANSWERED THE FELLOW HONESTLY
THE SCARECROW PLANS AN ESCAPE TIP SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE GIRLS AND FOLLOWED SWIFTLY AFTER THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS
TO ME SAID THE SAW HORSE A GOOD LEG IS MORE DESIRABLE THAN EITHER
CRIED THE PROFESSOR IN A LOUD VOICE THIS HIGHLY MAGNIFIED WOGGLE BUG
HE DOESN'T SEEM ESPECIALLY GRACEFUL HE REMARKED MUSINGLY BUT I SUPPOSE HE CAN RUN HE CAN INDEED SAID TIP GAZING UPON THE SAW HORSE ADMIRINGLY
IT WAS THROUGH THIS GATEWAY HIS MAJESTY PROPOSED TO ESCAPE AND THE ROYAL ARMY NOW LED THE SAW HORSE ALONG THE PASSAGE
I MUST HAVE LIVED FULLY THREE YEARS IN THAT SECLUDED SCHOOL HOUSE HEARTH SAID HE DRINKING THIRSTILY OF THE EVER FLOWING FOUNT OF LIMPID KNOWLEDGE BEFORE ME QUITE POETICAL
AND HIS MAJESTY HAS BEEN VERY KIND INDEED TO ME
BUT THE GUMP'S EYES WERE OF GLASS AND COULD NOT BE INJURED
HOW ABOUT THESE WISHING PILLS ENQUIRED THE SCARECROW TAKING THE BOX FROM HIS JACKET POCKET CAN'T WE USE THEM TO ESCAPE NOT UNLESS WE CAN COUNT SEVENTEEN BY TWOS ANSWERED THE TIN WOODMAN
BUT TELL ME HOW CAME YOUR MAJESTY HERE AND WHO ARE YOUR COMPANIONS THE SCARECROW WITH GREAT POLITENESS INTRODUCED TIP AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND THE LATTER PERSONAGE SEEMED TO INTEREST THE TIN WOODMAN GREATLY
THE CHILL NIGHTS RENDERED ME STIFF AND MOTIONLESS FOR I WORE NO CLOTHING BUT EACH MORNING THE WARM RAYS OF THE SUN GAVE ME NEW LIFE AND RESTORED ME TO ACTIVITY
I WILL GET OUT MY FAMOUS MAGNIFYING GLASS AND THROW THE INSECT UPON A SCREEN IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED CONDITION THAT YOU MAY ALL STUDY CAREFULLY ITS PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
BUT I WON'T TAKE ANOTHER PILL I PROMISE YOU AND WITH THIS REMARK HE RETIRED SULKILY TO THE BACK OF THE NEST WELL SAID THE WOGGLE BUG IT REMAINS FOR ME TO SAVE US IN MY MOST HIGHLY MAGNIFIED AND THOROUGHLY EDUCATED MANNER FOR I SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE AND WILLING TO MAKE A WISH
UNTIL THEY DREW UP BESIDE THE PALACE STEPS AN AGED WINKIE DRESSED IN A UNIFORM OF SILVER CLOTH CAME FORWARD TO ASSIST THEM TO ALIGHT SAID THE SCARECROW TO HIS PERSONAGE SHOW US AT ONCE TO YOUR MASTER THE EMPEROR
LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER CRITICALLY I BELIEVE THE BOY AND THE WOGGLE BUG ARE THE ONLY ONES IN OUR PARTY THAT ARE ABLE TO SWALLOW OBSERVING THE TRUTH OF THIS REMARK TIP SAID THEN I WILL UNDERTAKE TO MAKE THE FIRST WISH
EXCELLENT CRIED THE SCARECROW BRING THE HORSE HERE AT ONCE THE SOLDIER HASTENED AWAY AND PRESENTLY THEY HEARD THE CLATTERING OF THE HORSE'S WOODEN LEGS UPON THE PAVEMENT AS HE WAS LED INTO THE COURTYARD HIS MAJESTY REGARDED THE STEED CRITICALLY
THE COWARDLY LION AND THE SCARECROW THE LINES OF THE ENGRAVING BEING TRACED UPON THE SILVER IN YELLOW GOLD ON THE WALLS HUNG SEVERAL PORTRAITS
THEY COULD USE YOU FOR SEED THE SOLDIER NOW RETURNED WITH A LONG LINE AND TIED ALL THREE FIRMLY TOGETHER ALSO LASHING THEM TO THE BODY OF THE SAW HORSE SO THERE SEEMED LITTLE DANGER OF THEIR TUMBLING OFF NOW THROW OPEN THE GATES COMMANDED THE SCARECROW
ENTREATED THE TIN WOODMAN TEARS OF SYMPATHY RUNNING DOWN HIS NICKEL CHEEKS I I DON'T KNOW
THE SCHOLARS FOLLOWED AFTER HIM IN A WILD MOB AND I WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE SCHOOL ROOM STILL IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE AND FREE TO DO AS I PLEASED IT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO ME
WHY NOT USE ONE OF HIS LEGS TO MAKE A LEG FOR THE HORSE THAT CARRIES HIM I JUDGE THAT BOTH ARE MADE OF WOOD NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL REAL CLEVERNESS SAID THE SCARECROW APPROVINGLY I WONDER MY BRAINS DID NOT THINK OF THAT LONG AGO
SAID HE I HAVE CAPTURED A WOGGLE BUG A VERY RARE AND INTERESTING SPECIMEN DO ANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT A WOGGLE BUG IS NO YELLED THE SCHOLARS IN CHORUS THEN SAID THE PROFESSOR
I DID IT TO SAVE MY FRIENDS RETURNED THE HEAD AND I AM GLAD THAT I PERISHED IN SO NOBLE AND UNSELFISH A MANNER BUT WHY ARE YOU ALL SO DESPONDENT INQUIRED THE WOGGLE BUG THE SCARECROW'S CLOTHING IS STILL SAFE
BUT THAT ANIMAL BEING STILL UPON HIS BACK KICKED OUT SO VICIOUSLY WITH HIS WOODEN LEGS
AND I SUPPOSE HE IS NOW MORE PROUD THAN EVER OF HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HE IS INDEED SAID THE MAN WITH A POLITE BOW
THERE REMAINED SO LITTLE SPACE FOR THE KING THAT HE WAS LIABLE TO FALL OFF AS SOON AS THE HORSE STARTED FETCH A CLOTHESLINE SAID THE KING TO HIS ARMY AND TIE US ALL TOGETHER
DOCTOR NIKIDIK'S FAMOUS WISHING PILLS THE TIN WOODMAN WAS USUALLY A PEACEFUL MAN BUT WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED HE COULD FIGHT AS FIERCELY AS A ROMAN GLADIATOR
SO WHEN THE JACKDAWS NEARLY KNOCKED HIM DOWN IN THEIR RUSH OF WINGS AND THEIR SHARP BEAKS AND CLAWS THREATENED TO DAMAGE HIS BRILLIANT PLATING THE WOODMAN PICKED UP HIS AXE AND MADE IT WHIRL SWIFTLY AROUND HIS HEAD
HE RATTLED AND CLANKED A LITTLE AS HE MOVED BUT IN THE MAIN HE SEEMED TO BE MOST CLEVERLY CONSTRUCTED AND HIS APPEARANCE WAS ONLY MARRED BY THE THICK COATING OF POLISHING PASTE THAT COVERED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT
AND WE WILL MAKE A DASH TO LIBERTY OR TO DEATH THE COURTYARD IN WHICH THEY WERE STANDING WAS LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PALACE WHICH SURROUNDED IT ON ALL SIDES BUT IN ONE PLACE A PASSAGE LED TO AN OUTER GATEWAY
OVERTURNING SEVERAL MEEK LOOKING MEN AND FINALLY BOWLING OVER THE NEW GUARDIAN OF THE GATE A FUSSY LITTLE FAT WOMAN APPOINTED BY GENERAL JINJUR NOR DID THE IMPETUOUS CHARGER STOP THEN
CAUGHT UP INTO KNOTS AND FASTENED WITH TINY SILVER AXES UPON A HANDSOME CENTER TABLE STOOD A LARGE SILVER OIL CAN RICHLY ENGRAVED WITH SCENES FROM THE PAST ADVENTURES OF THE TIN WOODMAN DOROTHY
TO THAT OF HIS COMRADE DEAR ME SAID THE SCARECROW DOLEFULLY WHAT A MESS I'M IN NEVER MIND MY FRIEND RETURNED THE TIN WOODMAN I'LL SEND YOU TO MY IMPERIAL LAUNDRY AND YOU'LL COME OUT AS GOOD AS NEW
SO THE SAW HORSE CONTINUED HIS WILD CAREER UNCHECKED AND WITH UNABATED SPEED PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO THE BANKS OF A WIDE RIVER
OBJECTED TIP NO BUT HE MAY BE INDUCED TO CARRY THREE SAID HIS MAJESTY I SHALL THEREFORE LEAVE MY ROYAL ARMY BEHIND FOR FROM THE EASE WITH WHICH HE WAS CONQUERED
REPEATED THE TIN WOODMAN YES
YES ANSWERED THE TIN WOODMAN BUT OUR FRIEND'S CLOTHES ARE USELESS WITHOUT STUFFING WHY NOT STUFF HIM WITH MONEY
ARE LIABLE TO LIVE FOR MANY YEARS MY LIFE IS NECESSARILY SHORT SO I MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FEW DAYS THAT REMAIN TO ME THERE THERE DON'T WORRY ANSWERED THE SCARECROW SOOTHINGLY
IT IS TOO LATE TO ESCAPE THEY WOULD SOON TEAR YOU TO PIECES THE SCARECROW SIGHED IN AN EMERGENCY HE ANNOUNCED IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO PAUSE AND REFLECT
THE SCARECROW AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD WERE STILL PLAYING AT QUOITS IN THE COURTYARD WHEN THE GAME WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE ABRUPT ENTRANCE OF THE ROYAL ARMY OF OZ WHO CAME FLYING IN WITHOUT HIS HAT OR GUN
HE CAME TO A SMALL COUNTRY CALLED THE LAND OF THE BUSY BEES THE STREETS WERE FILLED WITH PEOPLE RUNNING TO AND FRO ABOUT THEIR TASKS EVERYONE WORKED EVERYONE HAD SOMETHING TO DO
THE BLOW FROM THE WAVE WAS SO STRONG THAT AS HE FELL TO THE GROUND HIS JOINTS CRACKED AND ALMOST BROKE BUT NOTHING DAUNTED HE JUMPED TO HIS FEET AND CRIED ONCE MORE I HAVE ESCAPED WITH MY LIFE LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SKY CLEARED
THE SEA WAS AS SMOOTH AS GLASS HEY THERE BOYS WHERE'S THAT SHARK HE ASKED TURNING TO HIS PLAYMATES HE MAY HAVE GONE FOR HIS BREAKFAST SAID ONE OF THEM LAUGHING OR PERHAPS HE WENT TO BED FOR A LITTLE NAP SAID ANOTHER LAUGHING ALSO

PINOCCHIO WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY ALL HIS FRIENDS AND SCHOOLMATES MUST BE INVITED TO CELEBRATE THE GREAT EVENT
BUT UNLUCKILY IN A MARIONETTE'S LIFE
SAID THE FAIRY TO HIM BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET INTO MISCHIEF AGAIN PINOCCHIO PROMISED TO STUDY AND TO BEHAVE HIMSELF AND HE KEPT HIS WORD FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR AT THE END OF IT HE PASSED FIRST IN ALL HIS EXAMINATIONS

HEY PINOCCHIO CRIED THE TALLEST OF THEM ALL THAT WILL DO WE ARE TIRED OF HEARING YOU BRAGGING ABOUT YOURSELF YOU LITTLE TURKEY COCK YOU MAY NOT BE AFRAID OF US BUT REMEMBER WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF YOU EITHER YOU ARE ALONE YOU KNOW AND WE ARE SEVEN
IN A HURRY AND THE WINDOW CLOSED A FEW MINUTES LATER MIDNIGHT STRUCK THEN ONE O'CLOCK TWO O'CLOCK AND THE DOOR STILL REMAINED CLOSED THEN PINOCCHIO LOSING ALL PATIENCE GRABBED THE KNOCKER WITH BOTH HANDS
COME WITH US BUT I AM INNOCENT COME WITH US BEFORE STARTING OUT THE OFFICERS CALLED OUT TO SEVERAL FISHERMEN PASSING BY IN A BOAT AND SAID TO THEM TAKE CARE OF THIS LITTLE FELLOW WHO HAS BEEN HURT TAKE HIM HOME AND BIND HIS WOUNDS TOMORROW WE'LL COME AFTER HIM
AS SOON AS HE TOUCHED THE KNOCKER HOWEVER IT BECAME AN EEL AND WIGGLED AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS REALLY CRIED PINOCCHIO BLIND WITH RAGE IF THE KNOCKER IS GONE I CAN STILL USE MY FEET HE STEPPED BACK AND GAVE THE DOOR A MOST SOLEMN KICK
EVEN IF ONE WERE TO SEARCH WITH A LANTERN NOT ONE IDLE MAN OR ONE TRAMP COULD HAVE BEEN FOUND I UNDERSTAND SAID PINOCCHIO AT ONCE WEARILY THIS IS NO PLACE FOR ME I WAS NOT BORN FOR WORK
THEY STARTED TO THROW ALL KINDS OF BOOKS AT HIM READERS GEOGRAPHIES HISTORIES GRAMMARS FLEW IN ALL DIRECTIONS BUT PINOCCHIO WAS KEEN OF EYE AND SWIFT OF MOVEMENT AND THE BOOKS ONLY PASSED OVER HIS HEAD

I THINK HE'S A VERY GOOD BOY FOND OF STUDY OBEDIENT KIND TO HIS FATHER AND TO HIS WHOLE FAMILY AS HE WAS TELLING ALL THESE ENORMOUS LIES ABOUT HIMSELF PINOCCHIO TOUCHED HIS NOSE AND FOUND IT TWICE AS LONG AS IT SHOULD BE
ROAST CHICKEN FRUIT HERE IS THE BREAKFAST THE FAIRY SENDS TO YOU SAID THE SNAIL AT THE SIGHT OF ALL THESE GOOD THINGS THE MARIONETTE FELT MUCH BETTER WHAT WAS HIS DISGUST HOWEVER WHEN ON TASTING THE FOOD

AND KEEP IT FOR YOUR SUPPER CALLED OUT THE BOLDEST OF HIS TORMENTORS AND WITH THE WORDS HE GAVE PINOCCHIO A TERRIBLE BLOW ON THE HEAD PINOCCHIO ANSWERED WITH ANOTHER BLOW AND THAT WAS THE SIGNAL FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE FRAY IN
KNOCKED A SECOND TIME THIS TIME LOUDER THAN BEFORE AT THAT SECOND KNOCK A WINDOW ON THE THIRD FLOOR OPENED AND THE SAME SNAIL LOOKED OUT DEAR LITTLE SNAIL CRIED PINOCCHIO FROM THE STREET I HAVE BEEN WAITING TWO HOURS FOR YOU
THE HOUSE HAD FOUR STORIES OPENED AND PINOCCHIO SAW A LARGE SNAIL LOOK OUT A TINY LIGHT GLOWED ON TOP OF HER HEAD WHO KNOCKS AT THIS LATE HOUR SHE CALLED IS THE FAIRY HOME ASKED THE MARIONETTE
CAME TO THE TOP OF THE WATER IN GREAT NUMBERS SOME TOOK A NIBBLE SOME TOOK A BITE BUT NO SOONER HAD THEY TASTED A PAGE OR TWO THAN THEY SPAT THEM OUT WITH A WRY FACE AS IF TO SAY
WHO HAPPENED TO BE A VERY POLITE DOLPHIN WILL YOU PLEASE TELL ME IF ON THIS ISLAND THERE ARE PLACES WHERE ONE MAY EAT WITHOUT NECESSARILY BEING EATEN SURELY THERE ARE ANSWERED THE DOLPHIN IN FACT YOU'LL FIND ONE NOT FAR FROM THIS SPOT AND HOW SHALL I GET THERE
WHY ALL THIS SURPRISE ASKED THE GOOD WOMAN LAUGHING BECAUSE ANSWERED PINOCCHIO STAMMERING AND STUTTERING
SAID TO HIM IN A ROUGH VOICE MARCH AND GO QUICKLY
IN FACT HE WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT HE WENT ALONG TAKING TWO STEPS FORWARD AND ONE BACK AND AS HE WENT HE SAID TO HIMSELF HOW SHALL I EVER FACE MY GOOD LITTLE FAIRY WHAT WILL SHE SAY WHEN SHE SEES ME WILL SHE FORGIVE THIS LAST TRICK OF MINE I AM SURE SHE WON'T
HE FOUND THE BREAD TO BE MADE OF CHALK THE CHICKEN OF CARDBOARD AND THE BRILLIANT FRUIT OF COLORED ALABASTER HE WANTED TO CRY HE WANTED TO GIVE HIMSELF UP TO DESPAIR HE WANTED TO THROW AWAY THE TRAY AND ALL THAT WAS ON IT INSTEAD
IF THE WORK IS TOO HARD FOR YOU MY BOY ENJOY YOUR YAWNS AND MAY THEY BRING YOU LUCK
HE KICKED SO HARD THAT HIS FOOT WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH THE DOOR AND HIS LEG FOLLOWED ALMOST TO THE KNEE NO MATTER HOW HE PULLED AND TUGGED HE COULD NOT PULL IT OUT THERE HE STAYED AS IF NAILED TO THE DOOR POOR PINOCCHIO
TELL ME THAT IT IS YOU DON'T MAKE ME CRY ANY LONGER IF YOU ONLY KNEW I HAVE CRIED SO MUCH I HAVE SUFFERED SO
IF I EVEN KNEW WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE I WOULD FIND HERE BUT WHOM SHALL I ASK THERE IS NO ONE HERE THE IDEA OF FINDING HIMSELF IN SO LONESOME A SPOT MADE HIM SO SAD
AND HIS REPORT WAS SO GOOD THAT THE FAIRY SAID TO HIM HAPPILY TOMORROW YOUR WISH WILL COME TRUE AND WHAT IS IT TOMORROW YOU WILL CEASE TO BE A MARIONETTE AND WILL BECOME A REAL BOY
VERY WELL I'LL TAKE THE JUG HOME FOR YOU THE JUG WAS VERY HEAVY AND THE MARIONETTE NOT BEING STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY IT WITH HIS HANDS HAD TO PUT IT ON HIS HEAD WHEN THEY ARRIVED HOME THE LITTLE WOMAN MADE PINOCCHIO SIT DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE
PINOCCHIO TRIED HIS BEST TO GET THERE BUT HE COULDN'T THE WAVES PLAYED WITH HIM AND TOSSED HIM ABOUT AS IF HE WERE A TWIG OR A BIT OF STRAW AT LAST AND LUCKILY FOR HIM A TREMENDOUS WAVE TOSSED HIM TO THE VERY SPOT WHERE HE WANTED TO BE
LET ME TELL YOU WITHOUT KNOWING IT I RUBBED MYSELF AGAINST A NEWLY PAINTED WALL HE LIED ASHAMED TO SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN MADE READY FOR THE FRYING PAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOUR COAT AND YOUR HAT AND YOUR BREECHES I MET THIEVES AND THEY ROBBED ME
AT THIS SPEECH HIS NOSE RETURNED TO ITS NATURAL SIZE WHY ARE YOU SO PALE
THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO CRY BUT JUST THEN HE SAW A BIG FISH SWIMMING NEAR BY WITH HIS HEAD FAR OUT OF THE WATER NOT KNOWING WHAT TO CALL HIM THE MARIONETTE SAID TO HIM HEY THERE MISTER FISH MAY I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU EVEN TWO IF YOU WANT ANSWERED THE FISH
THE REST OF THE NIGHT HE HAD TO SPEND WITH ONE FOOT THROUGH THE DOOR AND THE OTHER ONE IN THE AIR AS DAWN WAS BREAKING THE DOOR FINALLY OPENED THAT BRAVE LITTLE ANIMAL THE SNAIL
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR PINOCCHIO REACHES THE ISLAND OF THE BUSY BEES AND FINDS THE FAIRY ONCE MORE PINOCCHIO SPURRED ON BY THE HOPE OF FINDING HIS FATHER AND OF BEING IN TIME TO SAVE HIM SWAM ALL NIGHT LONG
DO YOU KNOW THIS PINOCCHIO BY SIGHT ANSWERED THE MARIONETTE
HE TURNED TO THE DOLPHIN AND SAID FAREWELL MISTER FISH
WERE ONLY THOSE WHO EITHER THROUGH AGE OR SICKNESS HAD LOST THE MEANS OF EARNING THEIR BREAD WITH THEIR OWN HANDS ALL OTHERS SHOULD WORK AND IF THEY DIDN'T AND WENT HUNGRY SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THEM JUST THEN A MAN PASSED BY
TAKE THAT PATH ON YOUR LEFT AND FOLLOW YOUR NOSE YOU CAN'T GO WRONG TELL ME ANOTHER THING YOU WHO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT THROUGH THE SEA DID YOU NOT PERHAPS MEET A LITTLE BOAT WITH MY FATHER IN IT AND WHO IS YOU FATHER HE IS THE BEST FATHER IN THE WORLD
THE FAIRY IS ASLEEP AND DOES NOT WISH TO BE DISTURBED WHO ARE YOU IT IS I WHO'S I PINOCCHIO WHO IS PINOCCHIO
HURRY I BEG OF YOU FOR I AM DYING OF COLD MY BOY I AM A SNAIL AND SNAILS ARE NEVER IN A HURRY AN HOUR PASSED
YOU'LL BE SORRY CUCK OO WE'LL WHIP YOU SOUNDLY CUCK OO YOU'LL GO HOME WITH A BROKEN NOSE CUCK OO VERY WELL THEN TAKE THAT
ONE IS WOUNDED PINOCCHIO IS ARRESTED GOING LIKE THE WIND PINOCCHIO TOOK BUT A VERY SHORT TIME TO REACH THE SHORE HE GLANCED ALL ABOUT HIM BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF A SHARK
HIS TONGUE WAS DRY AND TRY AS HE MIGHT HE COULD NOT UTTER A SINGLE WORD YET IN SPITE OF THIS NUMBNESS OF FEELING HE SUFFERED KEENLY AT THE THOUGHT OF PASSING UNDER THE WINDOWS OF HIS GOOD LITTLE FAIRY'S HOUSE WHAT WOULD SHE SAY ON SEEING HIM BETWEEN TWO CARABINEERS
THE DOG IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED PINOCCHIO'S VOICE GREAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND THAT THE VOICE CAME FROM THE LITTLE FLOUR COVERED BUNDLE THAT THE FISHERMAN HELD IN HIS HAND THEN WHAT DID HE DO WITH ONE GREAT LEAP
GET OUT I SAY REPEATED THE FISHERMAN AND HE DREW BACK HIS FOOT TO GIVE THE DOG A KICK THEN THE DOG WHO BEING REALLY HUNGRY WOULD TAKE NO REFUSAL
THEY DID NOT HAVE TO REPEAT THEIR WORDS THE MARIONETTE WALKED SWIFTLY ALONG THE ROAD TO THE VILLAGE BUT THE POOR FELLOW HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HE THOUGHT HE HAD A NIGHTMARE HE FELT ILL HIS EYES SAW EVERYTHING DOUBLE HIS LEGS TREMBLED
AND WHO THREW IT A SCHOOLMATE OF HIS A CERTAIN PINOCCHIO AND WHO IS THIS PINOCCHIO ASKED THE MARIONETTE FEIGNING IGNORANCE THEY SAY HE IS A MISCHIEF MAKER A TRAMP A STREET URCHIN CALUMNIES ALL CALUMNIES
THE SUN CAME OUT IN FULL SPLENDOR AND THE SEA BECAME AS CALM AS A LAKE THEN THE MARIONETTE TOOK OFF HIS CLOTHES AND LAID THEM ON THE SAND TO DRY HE LOOKED OVER THE WATERS TO SEE WHETHER HE MIGHT CATCH SIGHT OF A BOAT WITH A LITTLE MAN IN IT
OH NO SHE WON'T AND I DESERVE IT AS USUAL FOR I AM A RASCAL FINE ON PROMISES WHICH I NEVER KEEP HE CAME TO THE VILLAGE LATE AT NIGHT IT WAS SO DARK HE COULD SEE NOTHING AND IT WAS RAINING PITCHFORKS
BUT A BAD FIT OF COUGHING MADE HIM STOP AND TURN BACK MEANWHILE ALIDORO AS SOON AS HE HAD FOUND THE ROAD WHICH LED TO THE VILLAGE STOPPED AND DROPPED PINOCCHIO SOFTLY TO THE GROUND HOW MUCH I DO THANK YOU
AND DANCING GAYLY AROUND THE MARIONETTE AND THAT IS THAT WE HAVE MADE YOU STAY OUT OF SCHOOL TO COME WITH US AREN'T YOU ASHAMED OF BEING SUCH A GOODY GOODY AND OF STUDYING SO HARD YOU NEVER HAVE A BIT OF ENJOYMENT AND WHAT IS IT TO YOU IF I DO STUDY
SOME SO REMOTE FROM THIS LITTLE EARTH THAT THE LEARNED TELL US IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THEIR RAYS HAVE EVEN YET DISCOVERED IT AS A POINT IN SPACE WHERE ANYTHING IS SUFFERED OR DONE THE SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT WERE BROAD AND BLACK ALL THROUGH THE COLD AND RESTLESS INTERVAL UNTIL DAWN
HE HAD A WHITE BEARD RAGGEDLY CUT BUT NOT VERY LONG A HOLLOW FACE AND EXCEEDINGLY BRIGHT EYES THE HOLLOWNESS AND THINNESS OF HIS FACE WOULD HAVE CAUSED THEM TO LOOK LARGE UNDER HIS YET DARK EYEBROWS AND HIS CONFUSED WHITE HAIR
YET HE HAD SOME PLEASURE IN THE MERE SOUND OF HIS DAUGHTER'S VOICE AND INVARIABLY TURNED TO IT WHEN SHE SPOKE IN THE SUBMISSIVE WAY OF ONE LONG ACCUSTOMED TO OBEY UNDER COERCION HE ATE AND DRANK WHAT THEY GAVE HIM TO EAT AND DRINK AND PUT ON THE CLOAK AND OTHER WRAPPINGS THAT THEY GAVE HIM TO WEAR
BUT THEY WERE NATURALLY LARGE AND LOOKED UNNATURALLY SO HIS YELLOW RAGS OF SHIRT LAY OPEN AT THE THROAT AND SHOWED HIS BODY TO BE WITHERED AND WORN HE AND HIS OLD CANVAS FROCK AND HIS LOOSE STOCKINGS AND ALL HIS POOR TATTERS OF CLOTHES
THESE ARE THE PAPERS OF MONSIEUR INSIDE WITH THE WHITE HEAD THEY WERE CONSIGNED TO ME WITH HIM AT THE HE DROPPED HIS VOICE THERE WAS A FLUTTER AMONG THE MILITARY LANTERNS AND ONE OF THEM BEING HANDED INTO THE COACH BY AN ARM IN UNIFORM THE EYES CONNECTED WITH THE ARM LOOKED
MONSIEUR MANETTE DO YOU REMEMBER NOTHING OF ME THE SHOE DROPPED TO THE GROUND AND HE SAT LOOKING FIXEDLY AT THE QUESTIONER MONSIEUR MANETTE MISTER LORRY LAID HIS HAND UPON DEFARGE'S ARM
BEFORE THE FACE HAD DROPPED AGAIN THE FAINTNESS OF THE VOICE WAS PITIABLE AND DREADFUL IT WAS NOT THE FAINTNESS OF PHYSICAL WEAKNESS THOUGH CONFINEMENT AND HARD FARE NO DOUBT HAD THEIR PART IN IT ITS DEPLORABLE PECULIARITY WAS THAT IT WAS THE FAINTNESS OF SOLITUDE AND DISUSE
YOU CAN BEAR A LITTLE MORE THE SHOEMAKER STOPPED HIS WORK LOOKED WITH A VACANT AIR OF LISTENING AT THE FLOOR ON ONE SIDE OF HIM THEN SIMILARLY AT THE FLOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIM THEN UPWARD AT THE SPEAKER WHAT DID YOU SAY
SO SUNKEN AND SUPPRESSED IT WAS THAT IT WAS LIKE A VOICE UNDERGROUND SO EXPRESSIVE IT WAS OF A HOPELESS AND LOST CREATURE THAT A FAMISHED TRAVELLER WEARIED OUT BY LONELY WANDERING IN A WILDERNESS
SO THAT FROM THE VERY DOOR HE COULD BE TAKEN AWAY BUT CONSIDER IS HE FIT FOR THE JOURNEY ASKED MISTER LORRY MORE FIT FOR THAT I THINK THAN TO REMAIN IN THIS CITY SO DREADFUL TO HIM IT IS TRUE SAID DEFARGE WHO WAS KNEELING TO LOOK ON AND HEAR
THEY TRIED SPEAKING TO HIM BUT HE WAS SO CONFUSED AND SO VERY SLOW TO ANSWER THAT THEY TOOK FRIGHT AT HIS BEWILDERMENT AND AGREED FOR THE TIME TO TAMPER WITH HIM NO MORE HE HAD A WILD LOST MANNER OF OCCASIONALLY CLASPING HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS THAT HAD NOT BEEN SEEN IN HIM BEFORE
I ASKED LEAVE TO TEACH MYSELF AND I GOT IT WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY AFTER A LONG WHILE AND I HAVE MADE SHOES EVER SINCE AS HE HELD OUT HIS HAND FOR THE SHOE THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM MISTER LORRY SAID STILL LOOKING STEADFASTLY IN HIS FACE
A STRANGE THRILL STRUCK HIM WHEN SHE DID SO AND VISIBLY PASSED OVER HIS FRAME HE LAID THE KNIFE DOWN SOFTLY AS HE SAT STARING AT HER HER GOLDEN HAIR WHICH SHE WORE IN LONG CURLS HAD BEEN HURRIEDLY PUSHED ASIDE AND FELL DOWN OVER HER NECK
HAD IN A LONG SECLUSION FROM DIRECT LIGHT AND AIR
AGES AGO WHAT IS YOUR NAME MY GENTLE ANGEL HAILING HIS SOFTENED TONE AND MANNER HIS DAUGHTER FELL UPON HER KNEES BEFORE HIM WITH HER APPEALING HANDS UPON HIS BREAST O SIR
IN THE PAUSES OF HIS QUICK AND LABOURED BREATHING HE WAS HEARD TO SAY WHAT IS THIS WITH THE TEARS STREAMING DOWN HER FACE SHE PUT HER TWO HANDS TO HER LIPS AND KISSED THEM TO HIM THEN CLASPED THEM ON HER BREAST AS IF SHE LAID HIS RUINED HEAD THERE
THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO SAY WHICH WAS WHICH HE HAD PUT UP A HAND BETWEEN HIS EYES AND THE LIGHT AND THE VERY BONES OF IT SEEMED TRANSPARENT
WEEP FOR IT AND IF WHEN I SHALL TELL YOU OF MY NAME AND OF MY FATHER WHO IS LIVING AND OF MY MOTHER WHO IS DEAD
IF WHEN I TELL YOU DEAREST DEAR THAT YOUR AGONY IS OVER AND THAT I HAVE COME HERE TO TAKE YOU FROM IT AND THAT WE GO TO ENGLAND TO BE AT PEACE AND AT REST I CAUSE YOU TO THINK OF YOUR USEFUL LIFE LAID WASTE AND OF OUR NATIVE FRANCE SO WICKED TO YOU WEEP FOR IT
WEEP FOR IT IF YOU TOUCH IN TOUCHING MY HAIR ANYTHING THAT RECALLS A BELOVED HEAD THAT LAY ON YOUR BREAST WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG AND FREE WEEP FOR IT WEEP FOR IT IF WHEN I HINT TO YOU OF A HOME THAT IS BEFORE US
HERE IS MONSIEUR WHO KNOWS A WELL MADE SHOE WHEN HE SEES ONE SHOW HIM THAT SHOE YOU ARE WORKING AT TAKE IT MONSIEUR MISTER LORRY TOOK IT IN HIS HAND TELL MONSIEUR WHAT KIND OF SHOE IT IS AND THE MAKER'S NAME
YOU HAVE A VISITOR YOU SEE SAID MONSIEUR DEFARGE WHAT DID YOU SAY HERE IS A VISITOR THE SHOEMAKER LOOKED UP AS BEFORE BUT WITHOUT REMOVING A HAND FROM HIS WORK
I HOPE YOU CARE TO BE RECALLED TO LIFE AND THE OLD ANSWER
BREAD AND MEAT WINE AND HOT COFFEE
AT MONSIEUR WITH THE WHITE HEAD IT IS WELL FORWARD
SHE SIGHED NO WHO ARE YOU NOT YET TRUSTING THE TONES OF HER VOICE SHE SAT DOWN ON THE BENCH BESIDE HIM HE RECOILED BUT SHE LAID HER HAND UPON HIS ARM
AT ANOTHER TIME YOU SHALL KNOW MY NAME AND WHO MY MOTHER WAS AND WHO MY FATHER AND HOW I NEVER KNEW THEIR HARD HARD HISTORY BUT I CANNOT TELL YOU AT THIS TIME AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HERE ALL THAT I MAY TELL YOU HERE AND NOW IS
THEY ONCE MORE WHISPERED IN THE EARS OF MISTER JARVIS LORRY SITTING OPPOSITE THE BURIED MAN WHO HAD BEEN DUG OUT AND WONDERING WHAT SUBTLE POWERS WERE FOR EVER LOST TO HIM AND WHAT WERE CAPABLE OF RESTORATION THE OLD INQUIRY
A BROAD RAY OF LIGHT FELL INTO THE GARRET
HE HAD GRADUALLY DROPPED TO THE FLOOR AND LAY THERE IN A LETHARGY WORN OUT SHE HAD NESTLED DOWN WITH HIM THAT HIS HEAD MIGHT LIE UPON HER ARM AND HER HAIR DROOPING OVER HIM CURTAINED HIM FROM THE LIGHT
BUT I HAVE UNQUESTIONABLY SEEN FOR A SINGLE MOMENT THE FACE THAT I ONCE KNEW SO WELL HUSH LET US DRAW FURTHER BACK HUSH SHE HAD MOVED FROM THE WALL OF THE GARRET VERY NEAR TO THE BENCH ON WHICH HE SAT
GRADUALLY FORCED THEMSELVES THROUGH THE BLACK MIST THAT HAD FALLEN ON HIM THEY WERE OVERCLOUDED AGAIN THEY WERE FAINTER THEY WERE GONE BUT THEY HAD BEEN THERE AND SO EXACTLY WAS THE EXPRESSION REPEATED ON THE FAIR YOUNG FACE OF HER
ARE YOU GOING TO FINISH THAT PAIR OF SHOES TO DAY ASKED DEFARGE MOTIONING TO MISTER LORRY TO COME FORWARD WHAT DID YOU SAY DO YOU MEAN TO FINISH THAT PAIR OF SHOES TO DAY
I SAID COULDN'T YOU DESCRIBE THE KIND OF SHOE FOR MONSIEUR'S INFORMATION IT IS A LADY'S SHOE IT IS A YOUNG LADY'S WALKING SHOE IT IS IN THE PRESENT MODE I NEVER SAW THE MODE
ON THEIR REACHING THE COURTYARD HE INSTINCTIVELY ALTERED HIS TREAD AS BEING IN EXPECTATION OF A DRAWBRIDGE AND WHEN THERE WAS NO DRAWBRIDGE AND HE SAW THE CARRIAGE WAITING IN THE OPEN STREET HE DROPPED HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND AND CLASPED HIS HEAD AGAIN
HE NEVER LOOKED AT THE FIGURE BEFORE HIM WITHOUT FIRST LOOKING DOWN ON THIS SIDE OF HIMSELF THEN ON THAT AS IF HE HAD LOST THE HABIT OF ASSOCIATING PLACE WITH SOUND HE NEVER SPOKE WITHOUT FIRST WANDERING IN THIS MANNER AND FORGETTING TO SPEAK
IT DIED OUT AS EVERYTHING BUT HIS SHOEMAKING DID DIE OUT OF HIM AND HE REFOLDED HIS LITTLE PACKET AND TRIED TO SECURE IT IN HIS BREAST BUT HE STILL LOOKED AT HER AND GLOOMILY SHOOK HIS HEAD NO NO NO YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TOO BLOOMING
AND HIS HEAVING BREAST AND SHAKEN FORM HAD LONG YIELDED TO THE CALM THAT MUST FOLLOW ALL STORMS EMBLEM TO HUMANITY OF THE REST AND SILENCE INTO WHICH THE STORM CALLED LIFE MUST HUSH AT LAST THEY CAME FORWARD TO RAISE THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER FROM THE GROUND
IF WITHOUT DISTURBING HIM SHE SAID RAISING HER HAND TO MISTER LORRY AS HE STOOPED OVER THEM AFTER REPEATED BLOWINGS OF HIS NOSE
WAS NOT YET EMPTY I WANT SAID DEFARGE WHO HAD NOT REMOVED HIS GAZE FROM THE SHOEMAKER
THE SHOEMAKER GOOD DAY SAID MONSIEUR DEFARGE LOOKING DOWN AT THE WHITE HEAD THAT BENT LOW OVER THE SHOEMAKING IT WAS RAISED FOR A MOMENT AND A VERY FAINT VOICE RESPONDED TO THE SALUTATION AS IF IT WERE AT A DISTANCE GOOD DAY
HIS EYES CAME SLOWLY BACK AT LAST TO THE FACE FROM WHICH THEY HAD WANDERED WHEN THEY RESTED ON IT HE STARTED AND RESUMED IN THE MANNER OF A SLEEPER THAT MOMENT AWAKE REVERTING TO A SUBJECT OF LAST NIGHT
WITHOUT A MOMENT'S INTERMISSION THE TASK OF RECALLING HIM FROM THE VAGRANCY INTO WHICH HE ALWAYS SANK WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN WAS LIKE RECALLING SOME VERY WEAK PERSON FROM A SWOON OR ENDEAVOURING IN THE HOPE OF SOME DISCLOSURE TO STAY THE SPIRIT OF A FAST DYING MAN
IN A LOW VOICE I ENTREAT YOU GOOD GENTLEMEN DO NOT COME NEAR US DO NOT SPEAK DO NOT MOVE HARK HE EXCLAIMED WHOSE VOICE WAS THAT HIS HANDS RELEASED HER AS HE UTTERED THIS CRY AND WENT UP TO HIS WHITE HAIR WHICH THEY TORE IN A FRENZY
IT WAS LIKE THE LAST FEEBLE ECHO OF A SOUND MADE LONG AND LONG AGO SO ENTIRELY HAD IT LOST THE LIFE AND RESONANCE OF THE HUMAN VOICE THAT IT AFFECTED THE SENSES LIKE A ONCE BEAUTIFUL COLOUR FADED AWAY INTO A POOR WEAK STAIN
NO CROWD WAS ABOUT THE DOOR NO PEOPLE WERE DISCERNIBLE AT ANY OF THE MANY WINDOWS
HOW WAS THIS WAS IT YOU ONCE MORE THE TWO SPECTATORS STARTED AS HE TURNED UPON HER WITH A FRIGHTFUL SUDDENNESS BUT SHE SAT PERFECTLY STILL IN HIS GRASP AND ONLY SAID
THEY HAD NOT TRAVERSED MANY STEPS OF THE LONG MAIN STAIRCASE WHEN HE STOPPED AND STARED AT THE ROOF AND ROUND AT THE WALLS YOU REMEMBER THE PLACE MY FATHER YOU REMEMBER COMING UP HERE WHAT DID YOU SAY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD REPEAT THE QUESTION
THERE WAS A LONGER PAUSE THAN USUAL BEFORE THE SHOEMAKER REPLIED
KISS ME KISS ME O MY DEAR MY DEAR HIS COLD WHITE HEAD MINGLED WITH HER RADIANT HAIR WHICH WARMED AND LIGHTED IT AS THOUGH IT WERE THE LIGHT OF FREEDOM SHINING ON HIM IF YOU HEAR IN MY VOICE
IT CAN'T BE SEE WHAT THE PRISONER IS THESE ARE NOT THE HANDS SHE KNEW THIS IS NOT THE FACE SHE KNEW THIS IS NOT A VOICE SHE EVER HEARD NO NO SHE WAS AND HE WAS BEFORE THE SLOW YEARS OF THE NORTH TOWER
BOTH MISTER LORRY AND DEFARGE WERE RATHER DISINCLINED TO THIS COURSE AND IN FAVOUR OF ONE OF THEM REMAINING BUT AS THERE WERE NOT ONLY CARRIAGE AND HORSES TO BE SEEN TO BUT TRAVELLING PAPERS AND AS TIME PRESSED FOR THE DAY WAS DRAWING TO AN END
YOU SEE HOW COMPOSED HE HAS BECOME AND YOU CANNOT BE AFRAID TO LEAVE HIM WITH ME NOW WHY SHOULD YOU BE IF YOU WILL LOCK THE DOOR TO SECURE US FROM INTERRUPTION I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU WILL FIND HIM WHEN YOU COME BACK AS QUIET AS YOU LEAVE HIM IN ANY CASE
MISTER LORRY CAME SILENTLY FORWARD LEAVING THE DAUGHTER BY THE DOOR WHEN HE HAD STOOD FOR A MINUTE OR TWO BY THE SIDE OF DEFARGE THE SHOEMAKER LOOKED UP HE SHOWED NO SURPRISE AT SEEING ANOTHER FIGURE
SHE HAD NO FEAR OF HIS STRIKING AT HER WITH THE KNIFE THOUGH THEY HAD HE STARED AT HER WITH A FEARFUL LOOK AND AFTER A WHILE HIS LIPS BEGAN TO FORM SOME WORDS THOUGH NO SOUND PROCEEDED FROM THEM BY DEGREES
YOU ARE STILL HARD AT WORK I SEE AFTER A LONG SILENCE THE HEAD WAS LIFTED FOR ANOTHER MOMENT AND THE VOICE REPLIED YES I AM WORKING THIS TIME A PAIR OF HAGGARD EYES HAD LOOKED AT THE QUESTIONER
DARKNESS HAD FALLEN ON HIM IN ITS PLACE HE LOOKED AT THE TWO LESS AND LESS ATTENTIVELY AND HIS EYES IN GLOOMY ABSTRACTION SOUGHT THE GROUND AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM IN THE OLD WAY FINALLY WITH A DEEP LONG SIGH
HE READILY RESPONDED TO HIS DAUGHTER'S DRAWING HER ARM THROUGH HIS AND TOOK AND KEPT HER HAND IN BOTH HIS OWN THEY BEGAN TO DESCEND MONSIEUR DEFARGE GOING FIRST WITH THE LAMP MISTER LORRY CLOSING THE LITTLE PROCESSION
THE PRISONER HAD GOT INTO A COACH AND HIS DAUGHTER HAD FOLLOWED HIM WHEN MISTER LORRY'S FEET WERE ARRESTED ON THE STEP BY HIS ASKING MISERABLY FOR HIS SHOEMAKING TOOLS AND THE UNFINISHED SHOES
HE COULD NOT BE WHAT HE SAID HE WAS AND MUST GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS THE SECOND PRINCE SET OUT SOON AFTERWARDS ON THE SAME ERRAND AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE GOLDEN ROAD AND HIS HORSE HAD SET ONE FOOT UPON IT
IN A STATE OF INTENSE EXCITEMENT TO SEE
A FEASIBLE STORY WAS INVENTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ESCAPE OF THE INTENDED VICTIM OF THE LATE MASSACRE AND TO CONFIRM THE NATION IN THE BELIEF OF HIS IDENTITY WITH THEIR LATE CZAR MARINA THE WIDOWED CZARINA
AFTER LYING EXPOSED FOR SOME DAYS WAS UNCEREMONIOUSLY BURIED WITHOUT THE WALLS THEN DISINTERRED AND BURNT THE ASHES COLLECTED AND TO MAKE SURE OF NO FURTHER RESUSCITATION
MOREOVER ONE HISTORIAN SHOWS FROM CONTEMPORARY RECORDS
WHICH WAS A BRANCH OF THE ASCAGNE FAMILY THIS WAS A D THIRTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DAYS AFTER VOLDEMAR'S DEPARTURE HIS BROTHER JOHN DIED SUDDENLY NOT WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT HE HAD BEEN POISONED
THE PRINCE BEGGED SO HARD FOR HIS BROTHERS THAT THE DWARF AT LAST SET THEM FREE THOUGH UNWILLINGLY SAYING BEWARE OF THEM FOR THEY HAVE BAD HEARTS THEIR BROTHER HOWEVER
WITHOUT THE WORLD BEING ANY THE WISER THE FACTS AS THEY ARE RECOUNTED BY HISTORIANS STAND THUS VOLDEMAR THE SECOND MARQUIS OF BRANDENBURG WAS THE THIRTEENTH
I CAN GET NOTHING INTO YOUR HEAD YOU MUST GO FROM HENCE I WILL GIVE YOU INTO THE CARE OF A CELEBRATED MASTER WHO SHALL SEE WHAT HE CAN DO WITH YOU THE YOUTH WAS SENT INTO A STRANGE TOWN
AND HE FOUND HIMSELF UNABLE TO MOVE A STEP AND THUS HE WAS FORCED TO ABIDE SPELLBOUND MEANTIME
THEY RECOGNIZED THE CORPSE AS THAT OF THE REAL PRINCE AND AFFIRMED THAT BY HEAVENLY PROVIDENCE IT HAD BEEN PRESERVED IN ITS THEN CONDITION IT BEING FOUND QUITE UNCORRUPT AND THE GLOW OF LIFE NOT EVEN FADED FROM THE CHEEK
HAD RECOGNIZED HER SON AND THE NEW MONARCH WAS MASTER OF THE SITUATION HE RESPECTFULLY CONDUCTED THE CZARINA TO A CARRIAGE WALKING BARE HEADED BY ITS SIDE IN THE CAPITAL HE TREATED HER WITH EVERY ATTENTION
DECLARED FOR THE CLAIMANT AS DID ALSO THE RULERS OF BRUNSWICK POMERANIA MECKLENBURG AND SEVERAL OTHERS INCLUDING VOLDEMAR'S RELATIVES THE DUKE OF SAXONY AND THE PRINCES OF ANHALT
HIS FOLLOWERS WERE DESTROYED HIS WIFE BARELY ESCAPED WITH LIFE AND EVERY KIND OF INDIGNITY WAS OFFERED TO THE POLISH LADIES IN ATTENDANCE UPON HER THE BODY OF THE MURDERED MAN
YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR LIFE INTO THE BARGAIN BUT BE QUIET AND WE WILL LET YOU OFF
FOR I COULD NOT HAVE SHOT YOU THEN HE TOOK THE PRINCE'S COAT AND GAVE HIM THE SHABBY ONE AND WENT AWAY THROUGH THE WOOD SOME TIME AFTER THREE GRAND EMBASSIES CAME TO THE OLD KING'S COURT
THEY TOOK HIM FORTH BUT WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE KILLED HIM THEY COULD NOT DO IT FOR PITY AND LET HIM GO
AND WE SHALL HAVE THE REWARD PRAY WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS
WHEN HE CAME BACK THE FATHER AGAIN ASKED MY SON WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT HE ANSWERED FATHER I HAVE LEARNT WHAT THE BIRDS SAY THEN THE FATHER FELL INTO A RAGE AND SAID OH YOU LOST MAN
AND THUS THE KINGDOM WAS ONCE MORE IN PEACE AND PLENTY IN THE SAME MANNER HE BEFRIENDED TWO OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASSED ON THEIR WAY WHEN THEY CAME TO THE SEA THEY GOT INTO A SHIP
WHICH HE ALSO TOOK FURTHER ON
IN DAILY HOPE OF HIS SON'S RETURN
THE GUARDS SAID HE WAS NOT THE TRUE PRINCE AND THAT HE TOO MUST GO AWAY ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND AWAY HE WENT NOW WHEN THE FULL YEAR WAS COME ROUND THE THIRD BROTHER
THEY ARE BEWITCHED AND ARE OBLIGED TO WATCH OVER A GREAT TREASURE WHICH IS BELOW IN THE TOWER AND THEY CAN HAVE NO REST UNTIL IT IS TAKEN AWAY AND I HAVE LIKEWISE LEARNT FROM THEIR DISCOURSE
SAID THE PRINCE HAUGHTILY AND RODE ON BUT THE DWARF WAS ENRAGED AT HIS BEHAVIOUR AND LAID A FAIRY SPELL OF ILL LUCK UPON HIM SO THAT AS HE RODE ON THE MOUNTAIN PASS BECAME NARROWER
THAT HE WOULD REST HIMSELF FOR A WHILE AND GAZE ON THE LOVELY SCENES AROUND HIM
SO THAT IT WAS FEARED ALL MUST DIE FOR WANT BUT THE PRINCE GAVE THE KING OF THE LAND THE BREAD AND ALL HIS KINGDOM ATE OF IT AND HE LENT THE KING THE WONDERFUL SWORD AND HE SLEW THE ENEMY'S ARMY WITH IT
THE STATEMENT AS TO HIS DECEASE IN THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO IS THEY POINT OUT CONTRADICTORY WHILST HAD THE ELECTOR LOUIS KNOWN OF HIS PREDECESSOR'S DEATH WHY DID HE NOT PROCURE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF THE SAME
AND THEY WERE ALONE IN THE WOOD TOGETHER THE HUNTSMAN LOOKED SO SORROWFUL THAT THE PRINCE SAID MY FRIEND WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU
WHAT ROUTE HE INTENDED TAKING OR INDEED FURNISHING INFORMATION OF ANY KIND RELATIVE TO HIS INTENTIONS VOLDEMAR AND HIS BROTHER JOHN WERE THE ONLY SURVIVING MEMBERS OF THE ELDER BRANCH OF THE HOUSE OF ASCAGNE
HAD MURDERED BURNT AND FIRED FROM THE CANNON'S MOUTH THE WRONG MAN THIS TIME A SUBSTITUTED CORPSE COULD NOT BE PRODUCED A CIVIL WAR BROKE OUT
THE HISTORY OF THIS ADVENTURER IS RENDERED MORE THAN USUALLY INTERESTING FROM THE FACT THAT SEVERAL AUTHORS HAVE TAKEN UP CUDGELS ON HIS BEHALF AND VEHEMENTLY ASSERT THAT HE WAS TRULY
AT LAST A LITHUANIAN JEW WAS SELECTED BY THE INSURGENTS WHO AIDED BY THE POLES
ON THE TWENTIETH OF JUNE SIXTEEN O FIVE THE ADVENTURER ENTERED MOSCOW IN STATE AMID THE ACCLAMATIONS OF BELIEVING MULTITUDES ON ENTERING THE CHURCH OF SAINT MICHAEL THE PSEUDO DEMETRIUS ACCORDING TO ALL ACCOUNTS
THE EMPEROR LOUIS ACTING IN OPPOSITION TO ALL RIGHT SAVE THAT OF MIGHT INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THE DULY RECOGNIZED PRINCE TO SUCCEED TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ELECTORATE AND INVESTED HIS OWN SON LOUIS WITH IT
THE EMPEROR LOUIS WAS KNOWN MOREOVER TO HAVE ENTERTAINED GREAT HATRED AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ASCAGNE IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS CHIEFS RUDOLPH OF SAXONY AND VOLDEMAR THE FIRST UNCLE OF THE SECOND VOLDEMAR
HE DID IT THOROUGHLY AND BROUGHT A CHEST FULL OF GOLD OUT WITH HIM THE HOWLING OF THE WILD DOGS WAS HENCEFORTH HEARD NO MORE THEY HAD DISAPPEARED AND THE COUNTRY WAS FREED FROM THE TROUBLE AFTER SOME TIME
GENTLE AND SIMPLE CAME AT ONCE ON THE SUMMONS AND AMONG THE REST CAME THE FRIENDLY DWARF WITH THE SUGARLOAF HAT AND A NEW SCARLET CLOAK AND THE WEDDING WAS HELD AND THE MERRY BELLS RUN
AND BLAMED THE YOUNGEST FOR WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND SAID THAT HE WANTED TO POISON THEIR FATHER BUT THAT THEY HAD FOUND THE WATER OF LIFE AND HAD BROUGHT IT WITH THEM HE NO SOONER BEGAN TO DRINK OF WHAT THEY BROUGHT HIM THAN HE FELT HIS SICKNESS LEAVE HIM
TO PRODUCE THE EVIDENCE OFFERED BY THOSE OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY ON HIS BEHALF THE RECEIVED OPINION IS THAT RUDOLPH
THE REGENT LEFT THIS BOY TO THE CARE OF HIS MOTHER THE DOWAGER CZARINA UNDER WHOSE CHARGE HE ATTAINED TO THE AGE OF TEN ONE AFTERNOON OF MAY FIFTEEN NINETY ONE THE CHILD WAS PLAYING WITH FOUR OTHER BOYS
TAKING HER WITH HIM THEN HE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING HOW HIS BROTHERS HAD CHEATED AND ROBBED HIM AND YET THAT HE HAD BORNE ALL THOSE WRONGS FOR THE LOVE OF HIS FATHER AND THE OLD KING WAS VERY ANGRY
THIS HE OWES TO THY HOLY PRAYERS THE AUDIENCE WAS CONVINCED SOBBED IN UNISON AND FROM ALL SIDES AROSE THE CRY HE IS THE SON OF THE TERRIBLE
TO THINK THAT HE HAD GOT THE WATER OF LIFE AND AS HE WAS GOING ON HIS WAY HOMEWARDS HE PASSED BY THE LITTLE DWARF WHO WHEN HE SAW THE SWORD AND THE LOAF SAID YOU HAVE MADE A NOBLE PRIZE WITH THE SWORD YOU CAN AT A BLOW
NAMED JACQUES REBOC HE WAS THEY MOREOVER ALLEGE AN HABITUAL LIAR AND A CUNNING VAGABOND POSSESSING SOME RESEMBLANCE IN FORM AND FACE TO THE LOST PRINCE SUCH RESEMBLANCE INDEED
A LITTLE UGLY DWARF WITH A SUGARLOAF CAP AND A SCARLET CLOAK AND THE DWARF CALLED TO HIM AND SAID PRINCE WHITHER SO FAST WHAT IS THAT TO THEE YOU UGLY IMP
AND WANTED TO PUNISH HIS WICKED SONS BUT THEY MADE THEIR ESCAPE AND GOT INTO A SHIP AND SAILED AWAY OVER THE WIDE SEA AND WHERE THEY WENT TO NOBODY KNEW AND NOBODY CARED
INDEED AND THEIR DELIGHT AT BEING DELIVERED FROM THE DOMINION OF THE BAVARIANS WHO HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEIR COUNTRY AFTER IT HAD BEEN FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS GOVERNED BY THE HOUSE OF ASCAGNE THAT THEY FURNISHED THE SUPPOSED VOLDEMAR
THEY WILL LET YOU PASS THEN HASTEN ON TO THE WELL AND TAKE SOME OF THE WATER OF LIFE BEFORE THE CLOCK STRIKES TWELVE FOR IF YOU TARRY LONGER THE DOOR WILL SHUT UPON YOU FOR EVER THEN
ELECTOR OF THE FAMILY OF THE COUNTS OF ASCAGNE A FAMILY CLOSELY RELATED
AND BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT GO IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE AS IT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD SAVE HIM NO SAID THE KING I HAD RATHER DIE THAN PLACE YOU IN SUCH GREAT DANGER AS YOU MUST MEET WITH IN YOUR JOURNEY
UPON HIS DESTRUCTION ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF MAY SIXTEEN O SIX DEATH TO THE HERETIC RANG THROUGH THE STREETS OF MOSCOW THE EXCITED MOBS HEADED BY PRIESTS AND SHUISKI
AND REMAINED A WHOLE YEAR WITH THE MASTER AT THE END OF THIS TIME HE CAME HOME AGAIN AND HIS FATHER ASKED NOW MY SON WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT FATHER I HAVE LEARNT WHAT THE DOGS SAY WHEN THEY BARK
FATHER I WILL GO IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE FOR HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF MY BROTHER IS SURELY DEAD AND THE KINGDOM WILL FALL TO ME IF I FIND THE WATER THE KING WAS AT FIRST VERY UNWILLING TO LET HIM GO
THE ARCHBISHOP OF MAGDEBURG PRIMATE OF GERMANY A MAN TOTALLY UNINTERESTED EITHER WAY AND KNOWN FOR HIS PROBITY WOULD NOT THEY SAY HAVE RECOGNISED AND HAVE GIVEN HIS TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF THE CLAIMANT
AND LEFT HIS BROTHER JOHN THE FOURTH IN POSSESSION OF HIS ELECTORATE HE STARTED UPON HIS PILGRIMAGE ATTENDED ONLY BY TWO MEN HE SET OFF ON HIS JOURNEY WITHOUT INFORMING HIS BROTHER OR ANY OF HIS SUBJECTS
DWELT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN SAXONY WHERE HE HAD BEEN WELL INSTRUCTED AS TO THE FORMER LIFE AND FAMILY CONNECTIONS OF THE DECEASED ELECTOR AS WELL AS PUT IN THE WAY OF COUNTERFEITING ON HIS PERSON
IN ORDER TO AFFORD A FAIR IDEA OF THIS PRETENDER'S CLAIMS IT WILL BE NECESSARY IN THE FIRST PLACE TO RECOUNT THE STORY OF HIS APPEARANCE AS DETAILED BY THE AUTHORS FAVOURING THE THEORY OF HIS BEING AN IMPOSTOR AND THEN
AND THEREFORE THAT IT WAS NOT LESS THEIR INCLINATION THAN THEIR DUTY TO RECOMMEND ONLY SUCH MEASURES AS AFTER THE MOST MATURE DELIBERATION THEY REALLY THOUGHT PRUDENT AND ADVISABLE
FOR SO IS THE FACT THAT THIS PLAN IS ONLY RECOMMENDED NOT IMPOSED YET LET IT BE REMEMBERED THAT IT IS NEITHER RECOMMENDED TO BLIND APPROBATION NOR TO BLIND REPROBATION BUT TO THAT SEDATE AND CANDID CONSIDERATION
BUT THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA AGAINST DANGERS FROM FOREIGN FORCE DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON THEIR FORBEARING TO GIVE JUST CAUSES OF WAR TO OTHER NATIONS BUT ALSO ON THEIR PLACING AND CONTINUING THEMSELVES
IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT JEALOUSIES AND UNEASINESSES MAY GRADUALLY SLIDE INTO THE MINDS AND CABINETS OF OTHER NATIONS AND THAT WE ARE NOT TO EXPECT THAT THEY SHOULD REGARD OUR ADVANCEMENT IN UNION IN POWER AND CONSEQUENCE BY LAND AND BY SEA
BE ONE NATION UNDER ONE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR THAT THEY SHOULD DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES AND GIVE TO THE HEAD OF EACH THE SAME KIND OF POWERS WHICH THEY ARE ADVISED TO PLACE IN ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
WHAT WOULD THE MILITIA OF BRITAIN BE IF THE ENGLISH MILITIA OBEYED THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND IF THE SCOTCH MILITIA OBEYED THE GOVERNMENT OF SCOTLAND AND IF THE WELSH MILITIA OBEYED THE GOVERNMENT OF WALES SUPPOSE AN INVASION
ARE APT TO OPERATE AS WELL UPON THOSE WHO SUPPORT AS THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE RIGHT SIDE OF A QUESTION WERE THERE NOT EVEN THESE INDUCEMENTS TO MODERATION NOTHING COULD BE MORE ILL JUDGED THAN THAT INTOLERANT SPIRIT WHICH HAS AT ALL TIMES
ALTHOUGH SUCH CONDUCT WOULD NOT BE WISE IT WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE NATURAL THE HISTORY OF THE STATES OF GREECE AND OF OTHER COUNTRIES ABOUNDS WITH SUCH INSTANCES AND IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT WHAT HAS SO OFTEN HAPPENED WOULD
IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT A GOVERNMENT INSTITUTED IN TIMES SO INAUSPICIOUS SHOULD ON EXPERIMENT BE FOUND GREATLY DEFICIENT AND INADEQUATE TO THE PURPOSE IT WAS INTENDED TO ANSWER
VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES AND INCONVENIENCES WOULD BE INSEPARABLE FROM SUCH A SITUATION WHEREAS ONE GOVERNMENT WATCHING OVER THE GENERAL AND COMMON INTERESTS AND COMBINING AND DIRECTING THE POWERS AND RESOURCES OF THE WHOLE
FOR IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THAT CONGRESS WHO HAVE BEEN SINCE TRIED AND JUSTLY APPROVED FOR PATRIOTISM AND ABILITIES AND WHO HAVE GROWN OLD IN ACQUIRING POLITICAL INFORMATION
FOR AS OUR CARRYING TRADE CANNOT INCREASE WITHOUT IN SOME DEGREE DIMINISHING THEIRS IT IS MORE THEIR INTEREST AND WILL BE MORE THEIR POLICY TO RESTRAIN THAN TO PROMOTE IT
OFTEN LEAD HIM TO ENGAGE IN WARS NOT SANCTIFIED BY JUSTICE OR THE VOICE AND INTERESTS OF HIS PEOPLE BUT INDEPENDENT OF THESE INDUCEMENTS TO WAR WHICH ARE MORE PREVALENT IN ABSOLUTE MONARCHIES BUT WHICH WELL DESERVE OUR ATTENTION
THE CRISIS AT WHICH WE ARE ARRIVED MAY WITH PROPRIETY BE REGARDED AS THE ERA IN WHICH THAT DECISION IS TO BE MADE AND A WRONG ELECTION OF THE PART WE SHALL ACT MAY IN THIS VIEW
IT HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY REMARKED THAT IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RESERVED TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY BY THEIR CONDUCT AND EXAMPLE TO DECIDE THE IMPORTANT QUESTION WHETHER SOCIETIES OF MEN ARE REALLY CAPABLE OR NOT
NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THE INDISPENSABLE NECESSITY OF GOVERNMENT AND IT IS EQUALLY UNDENIABLE THAT WHENEVER AND HOWEVER IT IS INSTITUTED THE PEOPLE MUST CEDE TO IT
CHARACTERIZED POLITICAL PARTIES FOR IN POLITICS AS IN RELIGION IT IS EQUALLY ABSURD TO AIM AT MAKING PROSELYTES BY FIRE AND SWORD HERESIES IN EITHER CAN RARELY BE CURED BY PERSECUTION AND YET
PROVIDENCE HAS IN A PARTICULAR MANNER BLESSED IT WITH A VARIETY OF SOILS AND PRODUCTIONS AND WATERED IT WITH INNUMERABLE STREAMS FOR THE DELIGHT AND ACCOMMODATION OF ITS INHABITANTS
WHICH IN ITS CONSEQUENCES MUST PROVE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THAT EVER ENGAGED THEIR ATTENTION THE PROPRIETY OF THEIR TAKING A VERY COMPREHENSIVE AS WELL AS A VERY SERIOUS VIEW OF IT WILL BE EVIDENT
WHICH IS MORE COMMONLY THE FAULT OF THE HEAD THAN OF THE HEART WILL BE REPRESENTED AS MERE PRETENSE AND ARTIFICE THE STALE BAIT FOR POPULARITY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC GOOD IT WILL BE FORGOTTEN ON THE ONE HAND THAT JEALOUSY IS THE USUAL CONCOMITANT OF LOVE
WERE ALSO MEMBERS OF THIS CONVENTION AND CARRIED INTO IT THEIR ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK THAT NOT ONLY THE FIRST BUT EVERY SUCCEEDING CONGRESS AS WELL AS THE LATE CONVENTION
BY ANY IMPRESSIONS OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THE EVIDENCE OF TRUTH YOU WILL NO DOUBT AT THE SAME TIME HAVE COLLECTED FROM THE GENERAL SCOPE OF THEM THAT THEY PROCEED FROM A SOURCE NOT UNFRIENDLY TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION
THE CERTAIN EVILS AND THE PROBABLE DANGERS TO WHICH EVERY STATE WILL BE EXPOSED FROM ITS DISSOLUTION THIS SHALL ACCORDINGLY CONSTITUTE THE SUBJECT OF MY NEXT ADDRESS
AND CAN SUPPLY THEIR MARKETS CHEAPER THAN THEY CAN THEMSELVES NOTWITHSTANDING ANY EFFORTS TO PREVENT IT BY BOUNTIES ON THEIR OWN OR DUTIES ON FOREIGN FISH
TO JUDGE FROM THE CONDUCT OF THE OPPOSITE PARTIES WE SHALL BE LED TO CONCLUDE THAT THEY WILL MUTUALLY HOPE TO EVINCE THE JUSTNESS OF THEIR OPINIONS AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THEIR CONVERTS BY THE LOUDNESS OF THEIR DECLAMATIONS AND THE BITTERNESS OF THEIR INVECTIVES
YES MY COUNTRYMEN I OWN TO YOU THAT AFTER HAVING GIVEN IT AN ATTENTIVE CONSIDERATION I AM CLEARLY OF OPINION IT IS YOUR INTEREST TO ADOPT IT I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS IS THE SAFEST COURSE FOR YOUR LIBERTY YOUR DIGNITY
NOT ONLY MANY OF THE OFFICERS OF GOVERNMENT WHO OBEYED THE DICTATES OF PERSONAL INTEREST BUT OTHERS FROM A MISTAKEN ESTIMATE OF CONSEQUENCES OR THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF FORMER ATTACHMENTS
IN SUCH A SITUATION AS NOT TO INVITE HOSTILITY OR INSULT FOR IT NEED NOT BE OBSERVED THAT THERE ARE PRETENDED AS WELL AS JUST CAUSES OF WAR IT IS TOO TRUE HOWEVER DISGRACEFUL IT MAY BE TO HUMAN NATURE
JEALOUS AND ALIEN SOVEREIGNTIES SIMILAR SENTIMENTS HAVE HITHERTO PREVAILED AMONG ALL ORDERS AND DENOMINATIONS OF MEN AMONG US TO ALL GENERAL PURPOSES WE HAVE UNIFORMLY BEEN ONE PEOPLE EACH INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN EVERYWHERE
THAN CONSISTS WITH THE WISHES OR POLICY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SOVEREIGNS SPAIN THINKS IT CONVENIENT TO SHUT THE MISSISSIPPI AGAINST US ON THE ONE SIDE AND BRITAIN EXCLUDES US FROM THE SAINT LAWRENCE ON THE OTHER
OF ESTABLISHING GOOD GOVERNMENT FROM REFLECTION AND CHOICE OR WHETHER THEY ARE FOREVER DESTINED TO DEPEND FOR THEIR POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONS ON ACCIDENT AND FORCE IF THERE BE ANY TRUTH IN THE REMARK
WHICH WE USED TO PURCHASE FROM THEM THE EXTENSION OF OUR OWN COMMERCE IN OUR OWN VESSELS CANNOT GIVE PLEASURE TO ANY NATIONS WHO POSSESS TERRITORIES ON OR NEAR THIS CONTINENT
OR WHY IS IT SUGGESTED THAT THREE OR FOUR CONFEDERACIES WOULD BE BETTER THAN ONE I AM PERSUADED IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT RIGHT ON THIS SUBJECT AND THAT THEIR UNIVERSAL AND UNIFORM ATTACHMENT TO THE CAUSE OF THE UNION
BUT IF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE HAD REASON TO CONFIDE IN THE MEN OF THAT CONGRESS FEW OF WHOM HAD BEEN FULLY TRIED OR GENERALLY KNOWN STILL GREATER REASON HAVE THEY NOW TO RESPECT THE JUDGMENT AND ADVICE OF THE CONVENTION
AND THE MUTUAL TRANSPORTATION AND EXCHANGE OF THEIR VARIOUS COMMODITIES WITH EQUAL PLEASURE I HAVE AS OFTEN TAKEN NOTICE THAT PROVIDENCE HAS BEEN PLEASED TO GIVE THIS ONE CONNECTED COUNTRY TO ONE UNITED PEOPLE
OR WHOSE AMBITION AIMED AT OBJECTS WHICH DID NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE PUBLIC GOOD WERE INDEFATIGABLE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PERSUADE THE PEOPLE TO REJECT THE ADVICE OF THAT PATRIOTIC CONGRESS MANY INDEED WERE DECEIVED AND DELUDED
BUT THIS IS A THING MORE ARDENTLY TO BE WISHED THAN SERIOUSLY TO BE EXPECTED THE PLAN OFFERED TO OUR DELIBERATIONS AFFECTS TOO MANY PARTICULAR INTERESTS INNOVATES UPON TOO MANY LOCAL INSTITUTIONS
THIS INTELLIGENT PEOPLE PERCEIVED AND REGRETTED THESE DEFECTS STILL CONTINUING NO LESS ATTACHED TO UNION THAN ENAMORED OF LIBERTY THEY OBSERVED THE DANGER WHICH IMMEDIATELY THREATENED THE FORMER AND MORE REMOTELY THE LATTER
WE OUGHT TO SEEK IT IN A DIVISION OF THE STATES INTO DISTINCT CONFEDERACIES OR SOVEREIGNTIES HOWEVER EXTRAORDINARY THIS NEW DOCTRINE MAY APPEAR IT NEVERTHELESS HAS ITS ADVOCATES AND CERTAIN CHARACTERS WHO WERE MUCH OPPOSED TO IT FORMERLY
I AM WELL AWARE THAT IT WOULD BE DISINGENUOUS TO RESOLVE INDISCRIMINATELY THE OPPOSITION OF ANY SET OF MEN MERELY BECAUSE THEIR SITUATIONS MIGHT SUBJECT THEM TO SUSPICION INTO INTERESTED OR AMBITIOUS VIEWS CANDOR WILL OBLIGE US TO ADMIT
THAN THE ALTERNATIVE OF AN ADOPTION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION OR A DISMEMBERMENT OF THE UNION IT WILL THEREFORE BE OF USE TO BEGIN BY EXAMINING THE ADVANTAGES OF THAT UNION
OUR TRADE PRUDENTLY REGULATED OUR MILITIA PROPERLY ORGANIZED AND DISCIPLINED OUR RESOURCES AND FINANCES DISCREETLY MANAGED OUR CREDIT RE ESTABLISHED OUR PEOPLE FREE CONTENTED AND UNITED
BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE REASONED AND DECIDED JUDICIOUSLY AND HAPPY THEY ARE IN REFLECTING THAT THEY DID SO THEY CONSIDERED THAT THE CONGRESS WAS COMPOSED OF MANY WISE AND EXPERIENCED MEN THAT
AND THAT OF THOSE MEN WHO HAVE OVERTURNED THE LIBERTIES OF REPUBLICS THE GREATEST NUMBER HAVE BEGUN THEIR CAREER BY PAYING AN OBSEQUIOUS COURT TO THE PEOPLE COMMENCING DEMAGOGUES AND ENDING TYRANTS
OF THE POWER EMOLUMENT AND CONSEQUENCE OF THE OFFICES THEY HOLD UNDER THE STATE ESTABLISHMENTS AND THE PERVERTED AMBITION OF ANOTHER CLASS OF MEN WHO WILL EITHER HOPE TO AGGRANDIZE THEMSELVES BY THE CONFUSIONS OF THEIR COUNTRY
WHAT A POOR PITIFUL FIGURE WILL AMERICA MAKE IN THEIR EYES HOW LIABLE WOULD SHE BECOME NOT ONLY TO THEIR CONTEMPT BUT TO THEIR OUTRAGE AND HOW SOON WOULD DEAR BOUGHT EXPERIENCE PROCLAIM
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFTER AN UNEQUIVOCAL EXPERIENCE OF THE INEFFICACY OF THE SUBSISTING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU ARE CALLED UPON TO DELIBERATE ON A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
THAN UNDER THE FORBIDDEN APPEARANCE OF ZEAL FOR THE FIRMNESS AND EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT HISTORY WILL TEACH US THAT THE FORMER HAS BEEN FOUND A MUCH MORE CERTAIN ROAD TO THE INTRODUCTION OF DESPOTISM THAN THE LATTER
SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MADE FOR EACH OTHER AND IT APPEARS AS IF IT WAS THE DESIGN OF PROVIDENCE THAT AN INHERITANCE SO PROPER AND CONVENIENT FOR A BAND OF BRETHREN UNITED TO EACH OTHER BY THE STRONGEST TIES SHOULD NEVER BE SPLIT INTO A NUMBER OF UNSOCIAL
THE SUBJECT SPEAKS ITS OWN IMPORTANCE COMPREHENDING IN ITS CONSEQUENCES NOTHING LESS THAN THE EXISTENCE OF THE UNION THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE PARTS OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THE FATE OF AN EMPIRE IN MANY RESPECTS THE MOST INTERESTING IN THE WORLD
FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER SEVENTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN JAY TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
WILL AS IT WERE CONSOLIDATE THEM INTO ONE CORPS AND THEREBY RENDER THEM MORE EFFICIENT THAN IF DIVIDED INTO THIRTEEN OR INTO THREE OR FOUR DISTINCT INDEPENDENT COMPANIES
RESORT TO SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES OF DISTINCT PORTIONS OF THE WHOLE
AND THAT WHENEVER SUCH INDUCEMENTS MAY FIND FIT TIME AND OPPORTUNITY FOR OPERATION PRETENSES TO COLOR AND JUSTIFY THEM WILL NOT BE WANTING WISELY THEREFORE DO THEY CONSIDER UNION AND A GOOD NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
THE PATENT SAW MILLS AND SAWDUST CONSOLIDATION PROJECT
AND WE WENT TO VAUXHALL SINCE THEN I HAVE THOUGHT OF BUT ONE WOMAN IN THE WORLD AND THAT WAS YOU I THINK THERE IS NO HOUR IN THE DAY HAS PASSED FOR TWELVE YEARS THAT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF YOU I CAME TO TELL YOU THIS BEFORE I WENT TO INDIA
WHO WAS INDEED SCARCELY LESS AFFECTED THAN THE GOOD NATURED GIRL AMELIA LOVED HER LIKE A DAUGHTER DURING ELEVEN YEARS THE GIRL HAD BEEN HER CONSTANT FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE THE SEPARATION WAS A VERY PAINFUL ONE INDEED TO HER
TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN FORCED TO PUT UP PETITIONS FOR TIME WHEN THE RENT WAS OVERDUE
SHE FINGERED MISSUS OSBORNE'S DRESSES AND CALCULATED THEIR PRICE NOTHING COULD BE TOO GOOD FOR THAT SWEET LADY SHE VOWED AND PROTESTED
LITTLE POLLY WAS TOO YOUNG MISSUS OSBORNE COULD NOT FIND ANYBODY TO SUIT THE MAJOR BEFORE SHE WENT TO SLEEP THE SAME MORNING
SHE SLEPT THEREFORE VERY SOUNDLY THAT EVENING AFTER THE CONVERSATION WITH MISS POLLY AND WAS MORE THAN ORDINARILY HAPPY IN SPITE OF JOS'S DELAYING
WHEN ON THEIR PASSAGE OUT TO THE CAPE WHERE THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN WAS A MISSIONARY BUT FOR COMMON READING HE HAD BROUGHT A STOCK OF NOVELS AND PLAYS WHICH HE LENT TO THE REST OF THE SHIP AND RENDERED HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO ALL BY HIS KINDNESS AND CONDESCENSION
IT WAS I SAY HER NATURE TO SACRIFICE HERSELF AND TO FLING ALL THAT SHE HAD AT THE FEET OF THE BELOVED OBJECT DURING WHAT LONG THANKLESS NIGHTS HAD SHE WORKED OUT HER FINGERS FOR LITTLE GEORGY WHILST AT HOME WITH HER
OF STEWED EELS VEAL CUTLETS AND FRENCH BEANS WITH A BOTTLE OF CLARET HE WAS COLD OVER BAGSHOT HEATH WHERE THE NATIVE CHATTERED MORE AND MORE
ON BOARD MUCH CHEER HIM UNTIL AFTER A CONVERSATION WHICH THEY HAD ONE DAY
ON THE CONTRARY WITH SOMETHING AKIN TO GRATITUDE AMELIA TOOK THE CRUMBS THAT HER FATHER IN LAW LET DROP NOW AND THEN AND WITH THEM FED HER OWN PARENT DIRECTLY SHE UNDERSTOOD IT TO BE HER DUTY IT WAS THIS YOUNG WOMAN'S NATURE
AND LEAVING THE LITTLE PROPERTY OF WHICH HE WAS POSSESSED TO THOSE WHOM HE MOST DESIRED TO BENEFIT THE FRIEND IN WHOSE HOUSE HE WAS LOCATED WITNESSED HIS TESTAMENT HE DESIRED TO BE BURIED WITH A LITTLE
THERE WAS NO NEED OF THIS CAUTION FOR THE ELDER SEDLEY HIMSELF BEGAN IMMEDIATELY TO SPEAK OF THE EVENT AND PRATTLED ABOUT IT AND WEPT OVER IT PLENTEOUSLY IT SHOCKED THE INDIAN NOT A LITTLE AND MADE HIM THINK OF HIMSELF LESS THAN THE POOR FELLOW WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO
I HAVE TO BEG YOUR PARDON FOR SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT SAID HE ABOUT ABOUT THAT LITTLE SQUARE PIANO I NEVER THANKED YOU FOR IT WHEN YOU GAVE IT ME MANY MANY YEARS AGO BEFORE I WAS MARRIED I THOUGHT SOMEBODY ELSE HAD GIVEN IT
HE PASSED IN THE PREPARATION OF THESE DOCUMENTS TREMBLING ABOUT FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER WITH A QUIVERING CANDLE AND SHAKY HANDS HERE'S THE WINE PAPERS HERE'S THE SAWDUST HERE'S THE COALS HERE'S MY LETTERS TO CALCUTTA AND MADRAS
WHY MIRANDA WAS EVEN VERY KIND TO CALIBAN AND WE MAY BE PRETTY SURE FOR THE SAME REASON NOT THAT SHE WOULD ENCOURAGE HIM IN THE LEAST THE POOR UNCOUTH MONSTER OF COURSE NOT NO MORE WOULD EMMY BY ANY MEANS ENCOURAGE HER ADMIRER THE MAJOR
AND THE REFRESHMENT OF BRANDY PAWNEE WHICH HE WAS FORCED TO TAKE THERE
WHAT BUFFETS SCORNS PRIVATIONS POVERTIES HAD SHE ENDURED FOR FATHER AND MOTHER
THAT HE HAD BEEN TO SEE MISSUS GEORGE OSBORNE
HE DISAPPEARED RATHER IN A PANIC DURING A TWO DAYS GALE IN WHICH HE HAD THE PORTHOLES OF HIS CABIN BATTENED DOWN AND REMAINED IN HIS COT READING THE WASHERWOMAN OF FINCHLEY COMMON LEFT ON BOARD THE RAMCHUNDER BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LADY EMILY HORNBLOWER
THAT MAJOR DOBBIN HAD BEEN HER HUSBAND'S DEAREST FRIEND AND HER OWN AND GEORGE'S MOST KIND AND AFFECTIONATE GUARDIAN THAT SHE LOVED HIM AS A BROTHER BUT THAT A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN MARRIED TO SUCH AN ANGEL AS THAT AND SHE POINTED TO THE WALL COULD NEVER THINK OF ANY OTHER UNION
THEY WERE TWO MONTHS LATER THAN THE MAJOR'S AND THE SHIP'S SURGEON CONGRATULATED HIMSELF UPON THE TREATMENT ADOPTED BY HIM TOWARDS HIS NEW PATIENT WHO HAD BEEN CONSIGNED TO SHIPBOARD BY THE MADRAS PRACTITIONER WITH VERY SMALL HOPES INDEED FOR FROM THAT DAY
SHUDDERING IN A SHAWL ON THE BOX
LONG BROODING OVER THOSE LOST PLEASURES EXAGGERATES THEIR CHARM AND SWEETNESS JOS WAS UNAFFECTEDLY GLAD TO SEE AND SHAKE THE HAND OF HIS FATHER BETWEEN WHOM AND HIMSELF THERE HAD BEEN A COOLNESS GLAD TO SEE HIS LITTLE SISTER
PERHAPS HE WAS NOT INCLINED TO PUT HIMSELF IN HIS EXHAUSTED STATE AGAIN UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF GLORVINA I THINK MISS O'DOWD WOULD HAVE DONE FOR ME HE SAID LAUGHINGLY TO A FELLOW PASSENGER
EVEN WHEN MISSUS CLAPP LOST HER OWN TEMPER AND PRESSED FOR THE RENT WHEN THE KIND CREATURE WAS GOING AWAY FOR GOOD AND ALL THE LANDLADY REPROACHED HERSELF BITTERLY FOR EVER HAVING USED A ROUGH EXPRESSION TO HER HOW SHE WEPT
THE MAJOR'S VISIT LEFT OLD JOHN SEDLEY IN A GREAT STATE OF AGITATION AND EXCITEMENT HIS DAUGHTER COULD NOT INDUCE HIM TO SETTLE DOWN TO HIS CUSTOMARY OCCUPATIONS OR AMUSEMENTS THAT NIGHT
WAS SOOTHED DOWN BY THE MAJOR WHO POINTED OUT THE ELDER'S ILL FORTUNES AND OLD AGE HE WOULD NOT PERHAPS LIKE TO LIVE WITH THE OLD COUPLE WHOSE WAYS AND HOURS MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH THOSE OF A YOUNGER MAN
BANDBOXES OF THE EMIGRANTS FROM THAT VILLAGE AND WITH THEM THE OLD PIANO AMELIA WOULD HAVE IT UP IN HER SITTING ROOM A NEAT LITTLE APARTMENT ON THE SECOND FLOOR ADJOINING HER FATHER'S CHAMBER AND WHERE THE OLD GENTLEMAN SAT COMMONLY OF EVENINGS
THE VERY THOUGHT OF THEM IS ODIOUS AND LOW THERE MUST BE CLASSES THERE MUST BE RICH AND POOR DIVES SAYS SMACKING HIS CLARET
WHICH FAILED FROM A MOST UNACCOUNTABLE ACCIDENT AFTER COMMENCING WITH THE MOST SPLENDID PROSPECTS THE COAL PROJECT WHICH ONLY A WANT OF CAPITAL PREVENTED FROM BECOMING THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SCHEME EVER PUT BEFORE THE PUBLIC
BUT ALWAYS READY TO SMILE WHEN SPOKEN TO IN A VERY MEAN POOR NOT TO SAY VULGAR POSITION OF LIFE SINGING SONGS MAKING PUDDINGS PLAYING CARDS MENDING STOCKINGS FOR HER OLD FATHER'S BENEFIT SO NEVER MIND WHETHER SHE BE A HEROINE OR NO
AND AT A TIME WHEN HIS PRESENCE WAS LIKELY TO BE OF GREAT COMFORT TO HIS RELATIVES THERE MAJOR DOBBIN HAVING EASILY SUCCEEDED IN GETTING LEAVE FROM HIS GOOD NATURED COMMANDANT TO PROCEED TO MADRAS
WHITHER THE AFFECTIONATE FELLOW DROVE FIRST AND BEFORE HIEING TO THE APARTMENTS SECURED FOR HIM BY MISTER DOBBIN AT THE SLAUGHTERS ALL THE FACES IN THE STREET WERE IN THE WINDOWS THE LITTLE MAIDSERVANT FLEW TO THE WICKET GATE
THANK YOU WILLIAM SHE HELD OUT HER HAND BUT THE POOR LITTLE WOMAN'S HEART WAS BLEEDING AND AS FOR HER EYES OF COURSE THEY WERE AT THEIR WORK BUT WILLIAM COULD HOLD NO MORE AMELIA AMELIA HE SAID I DID BUY IT FOR YOU
DOBBIN BECAME SO IMPATIENT AND ILL HUMOURED AS TO SURPRISE THOSE COMRADES WHO HAD BEFORE ADMIRED HIS VIVACITY AND GOOD TEMPER HE DID NOT RECOVER UNTIL THE BREEZE SPRANG UP AGAIN AND WAS IN A HIGHLY EXCITED STATE WHEN THE PILOT CAME ON BOARD
AND THINKING THAT YEARS OF CONSTANCY AND DEVOTION MIGHT HAVE PLEADED WITH YOU IT IS YOU WHO ARE CRUEL NOW AMELIA SAID WITH SOME SPIRIT GEORGE IS MY HUSBAND HERE AND IN HEAVEN HOW COULD I LOVE ANY OTHER BUT HIM
THE MAJOR FOLDED HIS ARMS ROUND HER HOLDING HER TO HIM AS IF SHE WAS A CHILD AND KISSED HER HEAD I WILL NOT CHANGE DEAR AMELIA HE SAID I ASK FOR NO MORE THAN YOUR LOVE
THE CIVILIAN WAS THEREFORE AN EASY VICTIM TO THE GUILELESS ARTS OF THIS GOOD NATURED DIPLOMATIST AND WAS READY TO DO TO PURCHASE HIRE OR RELINQUISH WHATEVER HIS FRIEND THOUGHT FIT LOLL JEWAB
HER SERVILITY AND FULSOME COMPLIMENTS WHEN EMMY WAS IN PROSPERITY WERE NOT MORE TO THAT LADY'S LIKING SHE CAST ABOUT NOTES OF ADMIRATION ALL OVER THE NEW HOUSE EXTOLLING EVERY ARTICLE OF FURNITURE OR ORNAMENT
IT WAS A MATTER OF GREAT DELIGHT AND OCCUPATION TO JOS TO SUPERINTEND THE BUILDING OF A SMART CHARIOT WHICH HE AND THE MAJOR ORDERED IN THE NEIGHBOURING LONG ACRE AND A PAIR OF HANDSOME HORSES WERE JOBBED WITH WHICH JOS DROVE ABOUT IN STATE IN THE PARK
AND RENDERED HIMSELF SO GAY
BETTER DAYS AS FAR AS WORLDLY PROSPERITY WENT WERE IN STORE FOR BOTH PERHAPS THE INGENIOUS READER HAS GUESSED WHO WAS THE STOUT GENTLEMAN WHO CALLED UPON GEORGY AT HIS SCHOOL IN COMPANY WITH OUR OLD FRIEND MAJOR DOBBIN
I RECOLLECT SEEING YEARS AGO AT THE PRISONS FOR IDIOTS AND MADMEN AT BICETRE NEAR PARIS A POOR WRETCH BENT DOWN UNDER THE BONDAGE OF HIS IMPRISONMENT AND HIS PERSONAL INFIRMITY
OLD SEDLEY GREW VERY FOND OF HIS DAUGHTER AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH AND AMELIA HAD HER CONSOLATION IN DOING HER DUTY BY THE OLD MAN BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THESE TWO PEOPLE LONG IN SUCH A LOW AND UNGENTEEL STATION OF LIFE
LISTENED TO HIS STORIES WITH UNTIRING SMILES AND AFFECTIONATE HYPOCRISY OR SAT MUSING BY HIS SIDE AND COMMUNING WITH HER OWN THOUGHTS AND REMINISCENCES AS THE OLD MAN FEEBLE AND QUERULOUS SUNNED HIMSELF ON THE GARDEN BENCHES AND PRATTLED ABOUT HIS WRONGS OR HIS SORROWS
I WAS AFRAID YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT I VALUE IT MORE THAN ANYTHING I HAVE IN THE WORLD SAID AMELIA DO YOU AMELIA CRIED THE MAJOR THE FACT WAS AS HE HAD BOUGHT IT HIMSELF THOUGH HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT
AND HIS WHOLE HEART WAS BENT UPON DOING HER GOOD HE COAXED WHEEDLED CAJOLED AND COMPLIMENTED JOS SEDLEY WITH A PERSEVERANCE AND CORDIALITY OF WHICH HE WAS NOT AWARE HIMSELF VERY LIKELY BUT SOME MEN WHO HAVE UNMARRIED SISTERS OR DAUGHTERS EVEN
AND HOLDING ON TO LITTLE BOYS WITH THE EXCEEDING LARGE EYES AND CURLY HAIR OGLE LADIES IN RIDING HABITS PRANCING BY THE STATUE OF ACHILLES AT APSLEY HOUSE JOS ALTHOUGH PROVIDED WITH SOME OF THE MOST SPLENDID VESTS THAT CALCUTTA COULD FURNISH
TO LAY BY A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY HE WAS FREE TO COME HOME AND STAY WITH A GOOD PENSION OR TO RETURN AND RESUME THAT RANK IN THE SERVICE TO WHICH HIS SENIORITY AND HIS VAST TALENTS ENTITLED HIM
I DON'T CARE ABOUT OWNING IT WATERLOO SEDLEY WOULD SAY TO HIS FRIENDS I AM A DRESSY MAN AND THOUGH RATHER UNEASY IF THE LADIES LOOKED AT HIM AT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE BALLS AND THOUGH HE BLUSHED AND TURNED AWAY ALARMED UNDER THEIR GLANCES
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE FEELING NOW YOU ARE HURT IN YOUR HEART AT THE DISCOVERY ABOUT THE PIANO AND THAT IT CAME FROM ME AND NOT FROM GEORGE I FORGOT OR I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN OF IT SO IT IS FOR ME TO ASK YOUR PARDON FOR BEING A FOOL FOR A MOMENT
HE WAS RATHER THINNER THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HIM BUT HAD GAINED IN MAJESTY AND SOLEMNITY OF DEMEANOUR HE HAD RESUMED THE MUSTACHIOS TO WHICH HIS SERVICES AT WATERLOO ENTITLED HIM
THAT GEORGE'S MATERNAL GRANDFATHER WAS BUT A WRETCHED OLD BANKRUPT AND DEPENDANT AND THAT JOHN SEDLEY MIGHT THANK THE MAN TO WHOM HE ALREADY OWED EVER SO MUCH MONEY
WHO HAD MOST INJURED AND INSULTED HIM THE SUCCESSFUL MAN OF THE WORLD CURSED THE OLD PAUPER AND RELIEVED HIM FROM TIME TO TIME AS HE FURNISHED GEORGE WITH MONEY FOR HIS MOTHER HE GAVE THE BOY TO UNDERSTAND BY HINTS DELIVERED IN HIS BRUTAL COARSE WAY
OUR FRIEND BEGAN TO AMEND AND HE WAS QUITE WELL THOUGH AS GAUNT AS A GREYHOUND BEFORE THEY REACHED THE CAPE KIRK WILL BE DISAPPOINTED OF HIS MAJORITY THIS TIME HE SAID WITH A SMILE HE WILL EXPECT TO FIND HIMSELF GAZETTED BY THE TIME THE REGIMENT REACHES HOME
WHERE THE TROOPS SHOULD FIRE A SALVO OVER HIS GRAVE AND WHERE MANY A GALLANT OFFICER LIES FAR AWAY FROM HIS HOME HERE AS THE POOR FELLOW LAY TOSSING IN HIS FEVER THE PEOPLE WHO WATCHED HIM MIGHT HAVE HEARD HIM RAVING ABOUT AMELIA
SHAKING ALL OVER JOS DESCENDED FROM THE POST CHAISE AND DOWN THE CREAKING SWAYING STEPS IN AWFUL STATE SUPPORTED BY THE NEW VALET FROM SOUTHAMPTON AND THE SHUDDERING NATIVE WHOSE BROWN FACE WAS NOW LIVID WITH COLD
THE OLD MAN WAS VERY MUCH AFFECTED SO OF COURSE WAS HIS DAUGHTER NOR WAS JOS WITHOUT FEELING IN THAT LONG ABSENCE OF TEN YEARS THE MOST SELFISH WILL THINK ABOUT HOME AND EARLY TIES DISTANCE SANCTIFIES BOTH
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BUSINESS MY DEAR ANSWERED THE SIRE SHAKING HIS HEAD WITH AN IMPORTANT AIR AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT ON THIS POINT EMMY WAS VERY IGNORANT
YES HE IS A FRIEND O MINE ONE O THE BEST I EVER HAD IT'S A PITY HE AIN'T A FRIEND O YOURN YOU'D BE THE BETTER FOR IT
A FEW SECONDS LATER A HEAVY JAR FROM THE OUTSIDE SHOOK THE HINGES THEY ARE HERE MUTTERED WEST VERY PALE THAT DOOR OBSERVED COLETTE CALMLY
BUT WITH THE CHAIR HE MANAGED IT IF OLD DIAMOND HAD HAD AN EDUCATION IN PHYSICS TO EQUAL THAT OF THE CAMEL HE WOULD HAVE KNELT DOWN TO LET HIM PUT IT ON HIS BACK BUT THAT WAS MORE THAN COULD BE EXPECTED OF HIM
AND NOW AS THEY LOOKED A FIGURE CAME CREEPING THROUGH HOLDING A TORCH QUICK WHISPERED BRAITH JUMP AND WEST HUNG DANGLING UNTIL COLETTE GRASPED HIM BY THE COLLAR AND HE WAS DRAGGED OUT
AND WAS IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO THINK ABOUT THE DRIVER HAVING CARRIED HIM TO KING'S CROSS IN GOOD TIME AND GOT A GOOD FARE IN RETURN HE SET OFF AGAIN IN GREAT SPIRITS AND REACHED THE STAND IN SAFETY HE WAS THE FIRST THERE AFTER ALL
AND I'M AFRAID THAT SOME OF THE PILLAGERS MAY TAKE IT INTO THEIR HEADS TO PAY US A VISIT TO NIGHT BRAITH JUMPED OUT OF BED AND BUNDLED HIMSELF INTO A GARMENT WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN AN OVERCOAT ANYBODY HURT
BRAITH TWISTED HIS LEGS AROUND A FENCE CHAIN AND LEANED DOWN AGAIN THE CELLAR WAS FLOODED WITH A YELLOW LIGHT AND THE AIR REEKED WITH THE STENCH OF PETROLEUM TORCHES THE IRON DOOR STILL HELD BUT A WHOLE PLATE OF METAL WAS GONE
AND WHEN HE SAW IT WAS TRENT HE CRIED OUT TRENT SEIZED HIM WHITE WITH TERROR SYLVIA WEST STARED SPEECHLESS BUT COLETTE MOANED OH SYLVIA SYLVIA
DIAMOND SHOWED HIM HIS FATHER'S BADGE SAYING WITH A SMILE FATHER'S ILL AT HOME AND SO I CAME OUT WITH THE CAB THERE'S NO FEAR OF ME I CAN DRIVE BESIDES THE OLD HORSE COULD GO ALONE
YOU GO IN TO YOUR MOTHER DIAMOND I'LL PUT UP THE OLD OSS I'LL TAKE CARE ON HIM
BUT AT A DISTANCE SAW THE FLITTING FORMS OF PILLAGERS AMONG THE DEBRIS SOMETIMES THEY PASSED A FEMALE FURY CRAZED WITH DRINK SHRIEKING ANATHEMAS UPON THE WORLD OR SOME SLOUCHING LOUT WHOSE BLACKENED FACE AND HANDS
AND THERE WAS DIAMOND IN THE BOX HIS PALE FACE LOOKING TRIUMPHANT AS A FULL MOON IN THE TWILIGHT WHEN HE DREW UP AT THE STABLE DOOR JACK CAME OUT AND AFTER A GOOD MANY FRIENDLY QUESTIONS AND CONGRATULATIONS SAID
WHO DID NOT LOOK ONE TO TAKE LIBERTIES WITH OH IF HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS SAID THE OTHER DRAWING BACK DIAMOND GOT OUT THE NOSE BAG AGAIN OLD DIAMOND SHOULD HAVE HIS FEED OUT NOW
SYLVIA O JACK JACK JACK FROM THE TUMBLED PILLOW BESIDE THEM A CHILD WAILED THEY BROUGHT IT IT IS MINE SHE SOBBED OURS HE WHISPERED
WHEN HE GOT INTO THE YARD HE FOUND THE STABLE DOOR JUST OPENED I'M THE EARLY BIRD I THINK HE SAID TO HIMSELF I HOPE I SHALL CATCH THE WORM HE WOULD NOT ASK ANY ONE TO HELP HIM
JUST AS WELL I DARESAY YOU'RE A PAIR OF EM BUT YOU ARE A RUM UN FOR A CABBY AIN'T YOU NOW SAID THE POLICEMAN I DON'T KNOW AS I OUGHT TO LET YOU GO I AIN'T DONE NOTHING
BEGINNING TO GET BETTER THAT OR SOMETHING ELSE ANSWERED DIAMOND SO VERY QUIETLY THAT HIS MOTHER HELD HIS HEAD BACK AND STARED IN HIS FACE WELL OF ALL THE CHILDREN SHE SAID AND SAID NO MORE
BUT HE WON'T UPSET THE CAB WILL HE JACK NOT HE MA'AM LEASTWAYS HE WON'T GO FOR TO DO IT I KNOW AS MUCH AS THAT MYSELF WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN HE'S A LITTLE LIKELY TO DO IT AS THE OLDEST MAN IN THE STABLE
HE SAID AT LAST AIN'T YOU A CABBY THEN CABBIES DON'T CHEAT
THERE THAT VAN'S A MOVING NOW JUMP UP THE POLICEMAN DID AS DIAMOND TOLD HIM AND WAS SOON SATISFIED THAT THE LITTLE FELLOW COULD DRIVE WELL HE SAID AS HE GOT DOWN AGAIN
DIAMOND GAVE HIM A STARE WHICH CAME FROM THE VERY BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
GOT THEM UP ONE AFTER THE OTHER INTO THE LOOPS FASTENED THE TRACES THE BELLY BAND THE BREECHING AND THE REINS THEN HE GOT HIS WHIP THE MOMENT HE MOUNTED THE BOX THE MEN BROKE INTO A HEARTY CHEER OF DELIGHT AT HIS SUCCESS
BUT TO SEE HER FACE AS HE POURED THE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCES AND PENCE INTO HER LAP SHE BURST OUT CRYING A SECOND TIME AND RAN WITH THE MONEY TO HER HUSBAND
HERE A SKELETON OF A REGIMENT MARCHING WITH A DESPERATE ATTEMPT AT ORDER THERE A RIOTOUS MOB OF MOBILES CRUSHING THEIR WAY TO THE STREETS THEN A TURMOIL OF HORSEMEN CANNON TROOPS WITHOUT OFFICERS OFFICERS WITHOUT MEN
THE CHEER BROUGHT HIS MOTHER TO THE WINDOW AND THERE SHE SAW HER LITTLE BOY SETTING OUT ALONE WITH THE CAB IN THE GRAY OF MORNING SHE TUGGED AT THE WINDOW BUT IT WAS STIFF AND BEFORE SHE COULD OPEN IT
IT UD BE ONLY A DEVIL AS WOULD HURT HIM AND THERE AIN'T SO MANY O THEM AS SOME FOLK UD HAVE YOU BELIEVE A BOY O DIAMOND'S SIZE AS CAN ARNESS A OSS T'OTHER DIAMOND'S SIZE AND PUT HIM TO RIGHT AS A TRIVET
RETURNED DIAMOND I'M SORRY I COULDN'T FIND IT OUT MYSELF MISTER RAYMOND WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PLEASED WITH ME BUT YOU NEEDN'T TELL HIM ANY ONE TOLD YOU
HORSES PLUNGING AND CAISSONS JOLTING THE REMNANTS FROM THE FRONT SURGED THROUGH THE GATES A CHAOS OF CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY STRUGGLING FOR THE RIGHT OF WAY CLOSE UPON THEM STUMBLED THE INFANTRY
IT WAS TIME TO GIVE DIAMOND HIS BAG OF CHOPPED BEANS AND OATS THE MEN GOT ABOUT HIM AND BEGAN TO CHAFF HIM HE TOOK IT ALL GOOD HUMOUREDLY UNTIL ONE OF THEM
TOOK HIM ON HER LAP AS IF HE HAD BEEN A BABY AND CRIED HOW'S FATHER ASKED DIAMOND ALMOST AFRAID TO ASK BETTER MY CHILD SHE ANSWERED BUT UNEASY ABOUT YOU MY DEAR
NOW TREMBLING WITH THE BLOWS RAINED ON IT FROM WITHOUT WEST GLANCED ANXIOUSLY AT COLETTE WHO DISPLAYED NO AGITATION AND THIS COMFORTED HIM I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WILL SPEND MUCH TIME HERE SAID BRAITH
AND NOW THE WHOLE SQUARE WAS IN MOTION DOWN FROM THE CHAMPS ELYSEES AND ACROSS THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE STRAGGLED THE FRAGMENTS OF THE BATTLE A COMPANY HERE AND A MOB THERE
IN A FEW MINUTES A GROUP OF IDLE BOYS HAD ASSEMBLED AND DIAMOND FOUND HIMSELF IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION ANOTHER CAB DREW UP AT THE STAND AND THE DRIVER GOT OFF AND APPROACHED THE ASSEMBLAGE
THEY ONLY RUMMAGE IN CELLARS FOR SPIRITS I IMAGINE UNLESS THEY HEAR THAT VALUABLES ARE BURIED THERE BUT SURELY NOTHING IS BURIED HERE EXCLAIMED BRAITH UNEASILY UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS GROWLED WEST
PUSH IT OVER YOU MUST WITH LITTLE EFFORT BRAITH LIFTED THE BARRED COVER SCRAMBLED OUT ON HIS STOMACH AND EASILY RAISED COLETTE FROM WEST'S SHOULDERS QUICK OLD CHAP CRIED THE LATTER
RIPPED FROM ROOF TO BASEMENT AND THE LITTLE BAKERY LONG SINCE CLOSED BULGED OUTWARD ABOVE A MASS OF SLATE AND TIN HE CLIMBED OVER THE STEAMING BRICKS AND HURRIED INTO THE RUE DE TOURNON
QUARTER BRAITH WAS PAINTING IN BED WHEN WEST CAME IN VERY MUCH SCARED I WISH YOU WOULD COME DOWN OUR HOUSE HAS BEEN KNOCKED INTO A COCKED HAT
GOOD LUCK TO YOU MY LITTLE MAN THANK YOU SIR SAID DIAMOND AND DROVE AWAY IN A FEW MINUTES A GENTLEMAN HAILED HIM ARE YOU THE DRIVER OF THIS CAB HE ASKED
AND TURNING HIS HEAD LIKE A LITTLE BIRD WHY HOW ARE YOU TO GET OUT OF THIS RUCK NOW WHEN IT BEGINS TO MOVE JUST YOU GET UP ON THE BOX SAID DIAMOND AND I'LL SHOW YOU
YOU FOLLOW ME BRAITH AND HE RAN SWIFTLY TOWARD A CIRCULAR SPOT OF LIGHT AT THE FURTHER END OF THE CELLAR THE SPOT OF LIGHT CAME FROM A BARRED MAN HOLE ABOVE
PRESENTLY A SINGLE QUESTIONING BLOW FELL UPON THE DOOR AND A MOMENT LATER ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND THEN A SUDDEN CRACK ZIGZAGGED ACROSS THE IRON PLATE HERE SAID WEST SEIZING COLETTE BY THE WRIST
AND I SEES YOU TOO YOU'D BETTER LEAVE HIM ALONE HE AIN'T NO OYSTER HE'S A ANGEL COME DOWN ON HIS OWN BUSINESS YOU BE OFF OR I'LL BE NEARER YOU THAN QUITE AGREEABLE THE DRUNKEN CABMAN WAS A TALL STOUT MAN
THE LETTERS STARED HIM IN THE FACE THE RAT KILLER FINISHED AND STEPPED BACK TO VIEW HIS WORK BUT CATCHING SIGHT OF TRENT'S BAYONET SCREAMED AND FLED AND AS TRENT STAGGERED ACROSS THE SHATTERED STREET
AND HOW PLEASED HE WAS IT DID HIM NO END OF GOOD BUT WHILE HE WAS COUNTING THE COINS
BUT THEY WOULD NOT LET HIM GO WITHOUT A GENERAL INSPECTION OF THE HARNESS AND ALTHOUGH THEY FOUND IT RIGHT FOR NOT A BUCKLE HAD TO BE SHIFTED THEY NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO DO IT FOR HIMSELF AGAIN ALL THE TIME HIS FATHER WAS ILL
THEN AGAIN A LINE OF AMBULANCES THE WHEELS GROANING UNDER THEIR HEAVY LOADS DUMB WITH MISERY THE CROWD LOOKED ON ALL THROUGH THE DAY THE AMBULANCES HAD BEEN ARRIVING
PERDUS A RAGGED END OF A BATTALION WAS PRESSING PAST THE SPECTRE OF ANNIHILATION WEST GROANED THEN A FIGURE SPRANG FROM THE SHADOWY RANKS AND CALLED WEST'S NAME
IF THE OLD HORSE HAD HAD THE LEAST OBJECTION TO THE PROCEEDING OF COURSE HE COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT BUT EVEN WHEN IT CAME TO THE BRIDLE HE OPENED HIS MOUTH FOR THE BIT JUST AS IF HE HAD BEEN TAKING THE APPLE WHICH DIAMOND SOMETIMES GAVE HIM HE
WHO WAS AN ILL CONDITIONED FELLOW BEGAN TO TEASE OLD DIAMOND BY POKING HIM ROUGHLY IN THE RIBS AND MAKING GENERAL GAME OF HIM THAT HE COULD NOT BEAR AND THE TEARS CAME IN HIS EYES HE UNDID THE NOSE BAG
REJOINED THEM IT WAS ALMOST DARK THEY HURRIED THROUGH THE STREET NOW ONLY LIGHTED BY BURNING BUILDINGS OR THE SWIFT GLARE OF THE SHELLS THEY GAVE WIDE BERTH TO THE FIRES
AND THEN DIAMOND HAD TO CREEP QUITE UNDER HIM TO GET HOLD OF THE GIRTH THE COLLAR WAS ALMOST THE WORST PART OF THE BUSINESS BUT THERE DIAMOND COULD HELP DIAMOND
AND THE THRONG AT THE GATES PARTED SILENTLY AS THE TROOPS TRAMPED ALONG THE FREEZING STREETS CONFUSION CAME AS THE HOURS PASSED SWIFTLY AND MORE SWIFTLY CROWDING SQUADRON AFTER SQUADRON AND BATTERY ON BATTERY
YOU'RE A DEEP ONE BUT I THINK YOU'RE WRONG IT'S OVER FOUR MILES NOT MUCH BUT IT IS THEN THAT'S HALF A CROWN SAID DIAMOND
WHAT'S UP HERE HE ASKED AND DIAMOND KNEW THE VOICE IT WAS THAT OF THE DRUNKEN CABMAN DO YOU SEE THIS YOUNG OYSTER HE PRETENDS TO DRIVE A CAB SAID HIS ENEMY YES I DO SEE HIM
TRENT SHOUTED BRAITH BUT HE WAS GONE AND THEY COULD NOT OVERTAKE THEM
SO MUCH SO THAT SHE WAS ALMOST AFRAID WHEN SHE DID HEAR THE SOUND OF HIS CAB TO GO AND LOOK LEST SHE SHOULD BE YET AGAIN DISAPPOINTED AND SHOULD BREAK DOWN BEFORE HER HUSBAND BUT THERE WAS THE OLD HORSE AND THERE WAS THE CAB ALL RIGHT
IT'LL HELP FATHER TO GET WELL AGAIN IT WILL I HOPE IT MAY MY MAN I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU'RE AS GOOD AS YOU LOOK AFTER ALL AS DIAMOND RETURNED
AND MUST TREAT YOU TO IT EXCUSE ME VICOMTE I MUST TELL IT IN RUSSIAN OR THE POINT WILL BE LOST AND PRINCE HIPPOLYTE BEGAN TO TELL HIS STORY
THAT AT HER HOUSE HE CAME UPON BONAPARTE
HAD LEFT HER KINDLY AND TEAR WORN FACE AND IT NOW EXPRESSED ONLY ANXIETY AND FEAR HOW ABOUT MY SON BORIS PRINCE
ANNA PAVLOVNA THE MORE CONVENIENTLY TO KEEP THEM UNDER OBSERVATION
I KNEW YOU WOULD BE HERE REPLIED PIERRE I WILL COME TO SUPPER WITH YOU MAY I HE ADDED IN A LOW VOICE SO AS NOT TO DISTURB THE VICOMTE WHO WAS CONTINUING HIS STORY NO IMPOSSIBLE
AND THE VICOMTE LIFTED HIS SHOULDERS AND DROPPED HIS EYES AS IF STARTLED BY SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY WHEN SHE TOOK HER SEAT OPPOSITE AND BEAMED UPON HIM ALSO WITH HER UNCHANGING SMILE MADAME I DOUBT MY ABILITY BEFORE SUCH AN AUDIENCE
IN THE ACTIONS OF A STATESMAN ONE HAS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HIS ACTS AS A PRIVATE PERSON AS A GENERAL AND AS AN EMPEROR SO IT SEEMS TO ME YES YES OF COURSE PIERRE CHIMED IN PLEASED AT THE ARRIVAL OF THIS REINFORCEMENT
OR EVEN AN ORDINARY MAN WHO IS INNOCENT AND UNTRIED I SHOULD LIKE SAID THE VICOMTE TO ASK HOW MONSIEUR EXPLAINS THE EIGHTEENTH BRUMAIRE WAS NOT THAT AN IMPOSTURE IT WAS A SWINDLE AND NOT AT ALL LIKE THE CONDUCT OF A GREAT MAN
AND EVEN TO MAKE SCENES THIS LAST CONSIDERATION MOVED HIM MY DEAR ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA
PRINCE HIPPOLYTE WHO HAD BEEN GAZING AT THE VICOMTE FOR SOME TIME THROUGH HIS LORGNETTE SUDDENLY TURNED COMPLETELY ROUND TOWARD THE LITTLE PRINCESS AND HAVING ASKED FOR A NEEDLE
THAT HE ONLY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF HIS WORDS AFTER HE HAD UTTERED THEM HE SPOKE WITH SUCH SELF CONFIDENCE THAT HIS HEARERS COULD NOT BE SURE WHETHER WHAT HE SAID WAS VERY WITTY OR VERY STUPID
NONE SEEMED TO BORE HIM SO MUCH AS THAT OF HIS PRETTY WIFE HE TURNED AWAY FROM HER WITH A GRIMACE THAT DISTORTED HIS HANDSOME FACE KISSED ANNA PAVLOVNA'S HAND AND SCREWING UP HIS EYES SCANNED THE WHOLE COMPANY
THE ITALIAN'S FACE INSTANTLY CHANGED AND ASSUMED AN OFFENSIVELY AFFECTED SUGARY EXPRESSION EVIDENTLY HABITUAL TO HIM WHEN CONVERSING WITH WOMEN I AM SO ENCHANTED BY THE BRILLIANCY OF THE WIT AND CULTURE OF THE SOCIETY
PRINCE ANDREW
THE STORY WAS VERY PRETTY AND INTERESTING ESPECIALLY AT THE POINT WHERE THE RIVALS SUDDENLY RECOGNIZED ONE ANOTHER AND THE LADIES LOOKED AGITATED CHARMING SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA
FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD SAID PIERRE BLUSHING AND BREAKING INTO THE CONVERSATION ALMOST ALL THE ARISTOCRACY HAS ALREADY GONE OVER TO BONAPARTE'S SIDE IT IS THE BUONAPARTISTS WHO SAY THAT
THE PRINCESS RESTED HER BARE ROUND ARM ON A LITTLE TABLE AND CONSIDERED A REPLY UNNECESSARY SHE SMILINGLY WAITED ALL THE TIME THE STORY WAS BEING TOLD SHE SAT UPRIGHT GLANCING NOW AT HER BEAUTIFUL ROUND ARM
ALL SEEMED PUCKERED INTO A VACANT WEARIED GRIMACE AND HIS ARMS AND LEGS ALWAYS FELL INTO UNNATURAL POSITIONS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A GHOST STORY
SAID THE VICOMTE WITH A TOLERANT SMILE
AND VERY BIG ONES THAT WAS HER TASTE AND SHE HAD A LADY'S MAID ALSO BIG SHE SAID HERE PRINCE HIPPOLYTE PAUSED EVIDENTLY COLLECTING HIS IDEAS WITH DIFFICULTY SHE SAID OH YES SHE SAID GIRL TO THE MAID
THERE NOW SO YOU TOO ARE IN THE GREAT WORLD
WHO DOES NOT LOVE LIBERTY AND EQUALITY EVEN OUR SAVIOUR PREACHED LIBERTY AND EQUALITY
YES IF HAVING OBTAINED POWER WITHOUT AVAILING HIMSELF OF IT TO COMMIT MURDER HE HAD RESTORED IT TO THE RIGHTFUL KING I SHOULD HAVE CALLED HIM A GREAT MAN REMARKED THE VICOMTE HE COULD NOT DO THAT
BUT IN PRINCESS DRUBETSKAYA'S CASE HE FELT AFTER HER SECOND APPEAL SOMETHING LIKE QUALMS OF CONSCIENCE SHE HAD REMINDED HIM OF WHAT WAS QUITE TRUE HE HAD BEEN INDEBTED TO HER FATHER FOR THE FIRST STEPS IN HIS CAREER
CHARMING WHISPERED THE LITTLE PRINCESS STICKING THE NEEDLE INTO HER WORK AS IF TO TESTIFY THAT THE INTEREST AND FASCINATION OF THE STORY PREVENTED HER FROM GOING ON WITH IT THE VICOMTE APPRECIATED THIS SILENT PRAISE
SHE KNEW HIS FATHER TO BE A CONNECTION OF PRINCE VASILI'S THE ELDERLY LADY WHO HAD BEEN SITTING WITH THE OLD AUNT ROSE HURRIEDLY AND OVERTOOK PRINCE VASILI IN THE ANTEROOM ALL THE AFFECTATION OF INTEREST SHE HAD ASSUMED
AN EMBITTERED LOOK CLOUDED HER ONCE HANDSOME FACE BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE SMILED AGAIN AND CLUTCHED PRINCE VASILI'S ARM MORE TIGHTLY
AT LAST DECIDING SERIOUSLY TO PROVE TO THIS YOUTH HOW FOOLISH HIS WORDS WERE
HE WAS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WITH FIRM CLEARCUT FEATURES EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM FROM HIS WEARY BORED EXPRESSION TO HIS QUIET MEASURED STEP
BOTH WERE TALKING AND LISTENING TOO EAGERLY AND TOO NATURALLY WHICH WAS WHY ANNA PAVLOVNA DISAPPROVED THE MEANS ARE THE BALANCE OF POWER IN EUROPE AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE THE ABBE WAS SAYING
EVEN THE MOST PARTIAL CEASED TO REGARD HIM AS A HERO IF TO SOME PEOPLE HE WENT ON TURNING TO ANNA PAVLOVNA
EMANCIPATION FROM PREJUDICES AND EQUALITY OF CITIZENSHIP AND ALL THESE IDEAS NAPOLEON HAS RETAINED IN FULL FORCE LIBERTY AND EQUALITY SAID THE VICOMTE CONTEMPTUOUSLY AS IF
HIS EXTREME YOUTH AND HIS WISH TO EXPRESS ALL THAT WAS IN HIS MIND WHAT REVOLUTION AND REGICIDE A GRAND THING WELL AFTER THAT
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO WHAT YOU ASK BUT TO PROVE MY DEVOTION TO YOU AND HOW I RESPECT YOUR FATHER'S MEMORY I WILL DO THE IMPOSSIBLE YOUR SON SHALL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GUARDS HERE IS MY HAND ON IT ARE YOU SATISFIED MY DEAR BENEFACTOR
THAT I HAVE NOT YET HAD TIME TO THINK OF THE CLIMATE
I CAN'T REMAIN ANY LONGER IN PETERSBURG TELL ME WHAT NEWS I MAY TAKE BACK TO MY POOR BOY ALTHOUGH PRINCE VASILI LISTENED RELUCTANTLY AND NOT VERY POLITELY TO THE ELDERLY LADY EVEN BETRAYING SOME IMPATIENCE
APPARENTLY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER AGE AND BY FORCE OF HABIT EMPLOYED ALL THE OLD FEMININE ARTS BUT AS SOON AS THE PRINCE HAD GONE HER FACE RESUMED ITS FORMER COLD ARTIFICIAL EXPRESSION
AND BY THE WONDERFUL CLASSIC BEAUTY OF HER FIGURE HIS FACE ON THE CONTRARY WAS DULLED BY IMBECILITY AND A CONSTANT EXPRESSION OF SULLEN SELF CONFIDENCE WHILE HIS BODY WAS THIN AND WEAK HIS EYES NOSE AND MOUTH
HE WAS DRESSED IN A DARK GREEN DRESS COAT KNEE BREECHES OF THE COLOR
LEAVING THE PEOPLE TO ANARCHY AND NAPOLEON ALONE UNDERSTOOD THE REVOLUTION AND QUELLED IT AND SO FOR THE GENERAL GOOD HE COULD NOT STOP SHORT FOR THE SAKE OF ONE MAN'S LIFE WON'T YOU COME OVER TO THE OTHER TABLE
I HOPE THIS WILL PROVE THE LAST DROP THAT WILL MAKE THE GLASS RUN OVER ANNA PAVLOVNA CONTINUED
AND HASTILY ADJUSTING HIS LORGNETTE AS IF WITHOUT THIS INSTRUMENT HE COULD NOT BEGIN TO SPEAK WHY NO MY DEAR FELLOW SAID THE ASTONISHED NARRATOR SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS BECAUSE I HATE GHOST STORIES SAID PRINCE HIPPOLYTE IN A TONE WHICH SHOWED
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE NOT ONLY KNEW EVERYONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM BUT HAD FOUND THEM TO BE SO TIRESOME THAT IT WEARIED HIM TO LOOK AT OR LISTEN TO THEM AND AMONG ALL THESE FACES THAT HE FOUND SO TEDIOUS
SAID THE LITTLE PRINCESS
AND OF THE COMEDY OF THE PEOPLE OF GENOA AND LUCCA LAYING THEIR PETITIONS BEFORE MONSIEUR BUONAPARTE AND MONSIEUR BUONAPARTE SITTING ON A THRONE AND GRANTING THE PETITIONS OF THE NATIONS ADORABLE
HE WOULD SOON BE UNABLE TO ASK FOR HIMSELF
SAW CLEARLY THAT THIS YOUNG JACOBIN WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE AS HIS WORDS SUGGESTED ALL WERE SILENT HOW DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO ANSWER YOU ALL AT ONCE SAID PRINCE ANDREW BESIDES
MOREOVER HE COULD SEE BY HER MANNERS THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN MOSTLY MOTHERS WHO HAVING ONCE MADE UP THEIR MINDS WILL NOT REST UNTIL THEY HAVE GAINED THEIR END AND ARE PREPARED IF NECESSARY TO GO ON INSISTING DAY AFTER DAY AND HOUR AFTER HOUR
THE VICOMTE BOWED AND SMILED COURTEOUSLY IN TOKEN OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO COMPLY ANNA PAVLOVNA ARRANGED A GROUP ROUND HIM INVITING EVERYONE TO LISTEN TO HIS TALE
AND TOOK HIS ARM BEFORE HE LOOKED ROUND PRINCE ANDREW FROWNED AGAIN EXPRESSING HIS ANNOYANCE WITH WHOEVER WAS TOUCHING HIS ARM BUT WHEN HE SAW PIERRE'S BEAMING FACE HE GAVE HIM AN UNEXPECTEDLY KIND AND PLEASANT SMILE
SAID PRINCE ANDREW LAUGHING AND PRESSING PIERRE'S HAND TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO ASK THE QUESTION HE WISHED TO SAY SOMETHING MORE BUT AT THAT MOMENT PRINCE VASILI AND HIS DAUGHTER GOT UP TO GO AND THE TWO YOUNG MEN ROSE TO LET THEM PASS
DESPITE HER SOCIAL EXPERIENCE WAS HORROR STRUCK BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT PIERRE'S SACRILEGIOUS WORDS HAD NOT
BY THE FACT THAT IN SPITE OF THIS RESEMBLANCE HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY UGLY HIS FEATURES WERE LIKE HIS SISTER'S BUT WHILE IN HER CASE EVERYTHING WAS LIT UP BY A JOYOUS SELF SATISFIED YOUTHFUL AND CONSTANT SMILE OF ANIMATION
BUT ON THE CONTRARY SHE EVEN APPEARED SHY OF HER UNQUESTIONABLE AND ALL TOO VICTORIOUS BEAUTY SHE SEEMED TO WISH BUT TO BE UNABLE TO DIMINISH ITS EFFECT
AT THE PRESENT TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW THE REAL STATE OF FRENCH PUBLIC OPINION BONAPARTE HAS SAID SO REMARKED PRINCE ANDREW WITH A SARCASTIC SMILE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE DID NOT LIKE THE VICOMTE
SEVERAL PERSONS AMONG THEM THE ELDERLY LADY AND ANNA PAVLOVNA DID HOWEVER SMILE SHE WENT SUDDENLY THERE WAS A GREAT WIND THE GIRL LOST HER HAT AND HER LONG HAIR CAME DOWN
ON THE CONTRARY WE WANTED LIBERTY BUT BUONAPARTE HAS DESTROYED IT PRINCE ANDREW KEPT LOOKING WITH AN AMUSED SMILE FROM PIERRE TO THE VICOMTE AND FROM THE VICOMTE TO THEIR HOSTESS
THE PEOPLE ONLY GAVE HIM POWER THAT HE MIGHT RID THEM OF THE BOURBONS AND BECAUSE THEY SAW THAT HE WAS A GREAT MAN THE REVOLUTION WAS A GRAND THING CONTINUED MONSIEUR PIERRE BETRAYING BY THIS DESPERATE AND PROVOCATIVE PROPOSITION
PRINCE HIPPOLYTE HAVING BROUGHT THE WORKBAG JOINED THE CIRCLE AND MOVING A CHAIR CLOSE TO HERS SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HER LE CHARMANT HIPPOLYTE WAS SURPRISING BY HIS EXTRAORDINARY RESEMBLANCE TO HIS BEAUTIFUL SISTER BUT YET MORE
NOR HAVE I EVER REMINDED YOU OF MY FATHER'S FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU BUT NOW I ENTREAT YOU FOR GOD'S SAKE TO DO THIS FOR MY SON AND I SHALL ALWAYS REGARD YOU AS A BENEFACTOR SHE ADDED HURRIEDLY NO DON'T BE ANGRY BUT PROMISE
PIERRE HAD MANAGED TO START A CONVERSATION WITH THE ABBE ABOUT THE BALANCE OF POWER AND THE LATTER EVIDENTLY INTERESTED BY THE YOUNG MAN'S SIMPLE MINDED EAGERNESS WAS EXPLAINING HIS PET THEORY
AND THAT IN HIS PRESENCE NAPOLEON HAPPENED TO FALL INTO ONE OF THE FAINTING FITS TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECT AND WAS THUS AT THE DUC'S MERCY THE LATTER SPARED HIM AND THIS MAGNANIMITY BONAPARTE SUBSEQUENTLY REPAID BY DEATH
AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS BOLKONSKAYA VERY PRETTY AND ROSY THOUGH RATHER TOO PLUMP FOR HER AGE THE THIRD GROUP WAS GATHERED ROUND MORTEMART AND ANNA PAVLOVNA THE VICOMTE WAS A NICE LOOKING YOUNG MAN
THEY SAY HE WAS VERY FINE WHEN HE SAID THAT HE REMARKED REPEATING THE WORDS IN ITALIAN
SHE GAVE HIM AN INGRATIATING AND APPEALING SMILE AND TOOK HIS HAND THAT HE MIGHT NOT GO AWAY WHAT WOULD IT COST YOU TO SAY A WORD TO THE EMPEROR AND THEN HE WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GUARDS AT ONCE
THERE WAS A GENERAL MOVEMENT AS THE PRINCESS SMILING AND TALKING MERRILY TO EVERYONE AT ONCE SAT DOWN AND GAILY ARRANGED HERSELF IN HER SEAT NOW I AM ALL RIGHT SHE SAID AND ASKING THE VICOMTE TO BEGIN SHE TOOK UP HER WORK
WHAT A MAN THAT MUST BE WHO HAS SO WISE A SHADOW THOUGHT SHE IT WILL BE A REAL BLESSING TO MY PEOPLE AND KINGDOM IF I CHOOSE HIM FOR MY CONSORT I WILL DO IT THEY WERE SOON AGREED
WHEN THE SUN ROSE AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN I BECAME SO STRANGELY GREAT IN THE MOONLIGHT I WAS VERY NEAR BEING MORE DISTINCT THAN YOURSELF AT THAT TIME I DID NOT UNDERSTAND MY NATURE
THE STREET BOYS WERE SCREAMING AND HOOTING AND SHOUTING AND SHOOTING WITH DEVILS AND DETONATING BALLS AND THERE CAME CORPSE BEARERS AND HOOD WEARERS FOR THERE WERE FUNERALS WITH PSALM AND HYMN AND THEN
I RAN UP AND RAN DOWN PEEPED INTO THE HIGHEST WINDOWS INTO THE SALOONS AND ON THE ROOFS I PEEPED IN WHERE NO ONE COULD PEEP AND I SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD SEE
THEY BELONG TO MY CHILDHOOD'S LEARNING SAID THE SHADOW I REALLY BELIEVE MY SHADOW BY THE DOOR THERE CAN ANSWER THEM YOUR SHADOW SAID THE PRINCESS THAT WOULD INDEED BE MARVELLOUS
HERE IS MY CARD I LIVE ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET AND AM ALWAYS AT HOME IN RAINY WEATHER AND SO AWAY WENT THE SHADOW THAT WAS MOST EXTRAORDINARY SAID THE LEARNED MAN
BUT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL PERMIT ME TO OBSERVE THAT HE IS SO PROUD OF PASSING HIMSELF OFF FOR A MAN THAT WHEN HE IS TO BE IN A PROPER HUMOR AND HE MUST BE SO TO ANSWER WELL HE MUST BE TREATED QUITE LIKE A MAN
THE NARROW STREET WITH THE HIGH HOUSES WAS BUILT SO THAT THE SUNSHINE MUST FALL THERE FROM MORNING TILL EVENING IT WAS REALLY NOT TO BE BORNE THE LEARNED MAN FROM THE COLD LANDS HE WAS A YOUNG MAN
WAS IT THERE AS IN THE FRESH WOODS WAS IT THERE AS IN A HOLY CHURCH WERE THE SALOONS LIKE THE STARLIT FIRMAMENT WHEN WE STAND ON THE HIGH MOUNTAINS EVERYTHING WAS THERE SAID THE SHADOW
IT WAS FIRST TOWARDS EVENING WHEN THE SUN WAS DOWN THAT THEY BEGAN TO FRESHEN UP AGAIN IN THE WARM LANDS EVERY WINDOW HAS A BALCONY AND THE PEOPLE CAME OUT ON ALL THE BALCONIES IN THE STREET
BUT NO ONE CAME IN SO HE OPENED THE DOOR AND THERE STOOD BEFORE HIM SUCH AN EXTREMELY LEAN MAN THAT HE FELT QUITE STRANGE AS TO THE REST THE MAN WAS VERY FINELY DRESSED HE MUST BE A GENTLEMAN
I DID NOT GO QUITE IN I REMAINED IN THE FOREMOST ROOM IN THE TWILIGHT BUT I STOOD THERE QUITE WELL I SAW EVERYTHING AND I KNOW EVERYTHING I HAVE BEEN IN THE ANTECHAMBER AT THE COURT OF POESY
FOR HE KNEW THAT THE SHADOW WOULD ALWAYS HAVE ITS MASTER FOR A SCREEN BUT HE COULD NOT ENTICE IT HE MADE HIMSELF LITTLE HE MADE HIMSELF GREAT BUT NO SHADOW CAME AGAIN HE SAID HEM HEM
WELL THEN GO BUT DON'T STAY AWAY THE STRANGER ROSE AND HIS SHADOW ON THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S BALCONY ROSE ALSO
THE SHADOW IT IS IN THE HOT LANDS THAT THE SUN BURNS SURE ENOUGH THERE THE PEOPLE BECOME QUITE A MAHOGANY BROWN AY AND IN THE HOTTEST LANDS THEY ARE BURNT TO NEGROES
YES YOU SEE I HAVE EVEN GIVEN HIM A SHADOW IT IS SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE BUT I LIKE TO HAVE SOMETHING FOR MYSELF WHAT THOUGHT THE PRINCESS SHOULD I REALLY BE CURED THESE BATHS ARE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD
AND WHO LIVED THERE WHERE WAS THE ACTUAL ENTRANCE THE WHOLE OF THE GROUND FLOOR WAS A ROW OF SHOPS AND THERE PEOPLE COULD NOT ALWAYS BE RUNNING THROUGH ONE EVENING THE STRANGER SAT OUT ON THE BALCONY
AND THAT ONE MUST ALWAYS DO AND WHAT DIDST THOU THEN SEE ASKED THE LEARNED MAN I SAW EVERYTHING AND I SHALL TELL ALL TO YOU BUT IT IS NO PRIDE ON MY PART AS A FREE MAN AND WITH THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE
YES HE WAS QUITE AWAKE WITH ONE SPRING HE WAS ON THE FLOOR HE CREPT GENTLY BEHIND THE CURTAIN BUT THE MAIDEN WAS GONE THE FLOWERS SHONE NO LONGER BUT THERE THEY STOOD FRESH AND BLOOMING AS EVER
THE DIN OF CARRIAGES DRIVING AND COMPANY ARRIVING YES IT WAS IN TRUTH LIVELY ENOUGH DOWN IN THE STREET
THAT YOU CANNOT CAST A SHADOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS MUST BE IMPROVING CONSIDERABLY SAID THE SHADOW I KNOW YOUR COMPLAINT IS THAT YOU SEE TOO CLEARLY BUT IT HAS DECREASED YOU ARE CURED
I WILL TAKE YOU WITH ME FOR OLD ACQUAINTANCE SAKE I WILL PAY THE TRAVELLING EXPENSES AND YOU WRITE THE DESCRIPTIONS AND IF THEY ARE A LITTLE AMUSING FOR ME ON THE WAY I WILL GO TO A WATERING PLACE
THE MASTER OF THE MINT STRUCK NEW COIN FOR ME AND THE WOMEN SAID I WAS SO HANDSOME AND SO I BECAME THE MAN I AM
THOU ART ONLY DRESSED UP THERE IS NO ONE WHO WILL BELIEVE IT SAID THE SHADOW BE REASONABLE OR I WILL CALL THE GUARD I WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE PRINCESS SAID THE LEARNED MAN BUT I WILL GO FIRST SAID THE SHADOW
THE WOMAN DIDN'T THINK HOW MUCH SHE CONCEALED I WENT OUT FIRST IN THE EVENING I RAN ABOUT THE STREETS IN THE MOONLIGHT I MADE MYSELF LONG UP THE WALLS IT TICKLES THE BACK SO DELIGHTFULLY
YOU CERTAINLY NEVER THOUGHT OF SEEING ME SO WELL OFF DO YOU NOT KNOW YOUR OLD SHADOW YOU CERTAINLY THOUGHT I SHOULD NEVER MORE RETURN THINGS HAVE GONE ON WELL WITH ME SINCE I WAS LAST WITH YOU I HAVE IN ALL RESPECTS
IN OUR TIME WATER HAS WONDERFUL POWERS
I LEARNED TO KNOW MY INWARD NATURE MY INNATE QUALITIES THE RELATIONSHIP I HAD WITH POESY AT THE TIME I WAS WITH YOU I THOUGHT NOT OF THAT BUT ALWAYS YOU KNOW IT WELL
NAY IS IT REALLY THOU SAID THE LEARNED MAN IT IS MOST REMARKABLE I NEVER IMAGINED THAT ONE'S OLD SHADOW COULD COME AGAIN AS A MAN TELL ME WHAT I HAVE TO PAY SAID THE SHADOW
MY BEARD DOES NOT GROW OUT AS IT OUGHT THAT IS ALSO A SICKNESS AND ONE MUST HAVE A BEARD NOW YOU BE WISE AND ACCEPT THE OFFER WE SHALL TRAVEL AS COMRADES AND SO THEY TRAVELLED
BUT IT WAS OF NO USE IT WAS VEXATIOUS BUT IN THE WARM LANDS EVERYTHING GROWS SO QUICKLY AND AFTER THE LAPSE OF EIGHT DAYS HE OBSERVED TO HIS GREAT JOY THAT A NEW SHADOW CAME IN THE SUNSHINE
I AM IN THE MOST BRILLIANT CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THERE CAME A SORT OF DESIRE OVER ME TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE BEFORE YOU DIE YOU WILL DIE I SUPPOSE I ALSO WISHED TO SEE THIS LAND AGAIN
I TELL YOU I WAS THERE AND YOU CAN CONCEIVE THAT I SAW EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO BE SEEN HAD YOU COME OVER THERE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MAN BUT I BECAME SO AND BESIDES
THAT I HAVE BEEN YOUR SHADOW I INTEND TO GET BETROTHED FOR I CAN PROVIDE FOR MORE THAN ONE FAMILY BE QUITE AT THY EASE ABOUT THAT SAID THE LEARNED MAN I SHALL NOT SAY TO ANYONE WHO THOU ACTUALLY ART
THOU MUST SUBMIT TO BE CALLED SHADOW BY ALL AND EVERYONE THOU MUST NOT SAY THAT THOU HAST EVER BEEN A MAN AND ONCE A YEAR WHEN I SIT ON THE BALCONY IN THE SUNSHINE
BUT NOW YOU MUST TELL ME ALL YOU SAW EVERYTHING SAID THE SHADOW FOR I SAW EVERYTHING AND I KNOW EVERYTHING HOW DID IT LOOK IN THE FURTHEST SALOON ASKED THE LEARNED MAN
ONLY IMAGINE YES IT IS TRUE SUCH A POOR SHADOW SKULL CANNOT BEAR MUCH ONLY THINK MY SHADOW HAS BECOME MAD HE THINKS THAT HE IS A MAN AND THAT I
COME NOW BE USEFUL AND DO ME A SERVICE SAID HE IN JEST HAVE THE KINDNESS TO STEP IN NOW ART THOU GOING AND THEN HE NODDED TO THE SHADOW AND THE SHADOW NODDED AGAIN
IT WAS AS IF SHE ALSO SHONE THE LIGHT REALLY HURT HIS EYES
AND CANDLES BURNT YES ABOVE A THOUSAND LIGHTS WERE BURNING AND THE ONE TALKED AND THE OTHER SUNG AND PEOPLE WALKED AND CHURCH BELLS RANG AND ASSES WENT ALONG WITH A DINGLE DINGLE DONG FOR THEY TOO HAD BELLS ON
FOR YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS LOVE OUR NATIVE LAND I KNOW YOU HAVE GOT ANOTHER SHADOW AGAIN HAVE I ANYTHING TO PAY TO IT OR YOU IF SO YOU WILL OBLIGE ME BY SAYING WHAT IT IS
ASKED THE LEARNED MAN YES I THOUGHT AS MUCH SAID THE FINE MAN I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NOT KNOW ME I HAVE GOT SO MUCH BODY I HAVE EVEN GOT FLESH AND CLOTHES
THEY GREW SO WELL IN THE SUN'S HEAT AND THAT THEY COULD NOT DO UNLESS THEY WERE WATERED AND SOME ONE MUST WATER THEM THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE THE DOOR OPPOSITE WAS ALSO OPENED LATE IN THE EVENING
AND AMONGST THEM WAS A PRINCESS WHO WAS TROUBLED WITH SEEING TOO WELL AND THAT WAS SO ALARMING SHE DIRECTLY OBSERVED THAT THE STRANGER WHO HAD JUST COME WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT SORT OF PERSON TO ALL THE OTHERS
SO THAT SHE WAS QUITE ASTONISHED HE MUST BE THE WISEST MAN IN THE WHOLE WORLD SHE FELT SUCH RESPECT FOR WHAT HE KNEW SO THAT WHEN THEY AGAIN DANCED TOGETHER SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
I AM EXTREMELY GLAD TO HEAR OF THY GOOD FORTUNE SIT DOWN OLD FRIEND AND TELL ME A LITTLE HOW IT HAS GONE WITH THEE AND WHAT THOU HAST SEEN AT OUR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S THERE IN THE WARM LANDS
FOR ONE MUST HAVE AIR EVEN IF ONE BE ACCUSTOMED TO BE MAHOGANY IT WAS LIVELY BOTH UP AND DOWN THE STREET TAILORS AND SHOEMAKERS AND ALL THE FOLKS MOVED OUT INTO THE STREET CHAIRS AND TABLES WERE BROUGHT FORTH
THEN THE SHADOW CAME AGAIN HOW GOES IT SAID THE SHADOW ALAS SAID THE LEARNED MAN I WRITE ABOUT THE TRUE AND THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL BUT NO ONE CARES TO HEAR SUCH THINGS I AM QUITE DESPERATE
FOR HE FOUND EVERYTHING MARVELLOUS OUT THERE IN THE WARM LANDS IF THERE HAD ONLY BEEN NO SUN THE STRANGER'S LANDLORD SAID THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO HAD TAKEN THE HOUSE OPPOSITE ONE SAW NO PERSON ABOUT
FOR I TAKE IT SO MUCH TO HEART BUT I DON'T SAID THE SHADOW I BECOME FAT AND IT IS THAT ONE WANTS TO BECOME YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORLD YOU WILL BECOME ILL BY IT YOU MUST TRAVEL
SAID THE SHADOW AND THEN HE SAT WITH THE POLISHED BOOTS AS HEAVILY AS HE COULD ON THE ARM OF THE LEARNED MAN'S NEW SHADOW WHICH LAY LIKE A POODLE DOG AT HIS FEET NOW THIS WAS PERHAPS FROM ARROGANCE
AND THE SHADOW ON THE GROUND KEPT ITSELF SO STILL AND QUIET THAT IT MIGHT HEAR ALL THAT PASSED IT WISHED TO KNOW HOW IT COULD GET FREE AND WORK ITS WAY UP SO AS TO BECOME ITS OWN MASTER
FOR HE CAUGHT ONE BY THE LEGS ANOTHER BY THE SCRIP ANOTHER BY THE POCKET ANOTHER BY THE SCARF
I AM CONFIDENT YOU WILL DO NOTHING WHICH CAN HURT MY FEELINGS AND I WILL DIE BY TORTURE SOONER THAN DO ANY THING WHICH COULD OFFEND YOU
THE SAINT GEORGE WILL STAMP AN ADDITIONAL RAY OF GLORY TO ENGLAND'S FAME IF NELSON SURVIVES AND THAT ALMIGHTY PROVIDENCE WHO HAS HITHERTO PROTECTED ME IN ALL DANGERS AND COVERED MY HEAD IN THE DAY OF BATTLE WILL STILL IF IT BE HIS PLEASURE SUPPORT AND ASSIST ME

I CANNOT COMMAND AND NOW ONLY OBEY MISTER TYSON AND THE CONSUL
HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT ANY NEAPOLITAN OFFICERS ARE IN THE ISLAND PERHAPS ALTHOUGH I HAVE THEIR NAMES NONE ARE ARRIVED AND IT IS VERY CERTAIN BY THE MARQUIS'S ACCOUNT THAT NO SUPPLIES HAVE BEEN SENT BY THE GOVERNORS OF SYRACUSE OR MESSINA

YOUR OBLIGED AND FAITHFUL FRIEND HORATIO NELSON I MAY POSSIBLY BUT THAT IS NOT CERTAIN SEND IN THE INCLOSED LETTER SHEW IT TO SIR WILLIAM THIS MUST DEPEND ON WHAT I HEAR AND SEE FOR I BELIEVE SCARCELY ANY THING I HEAR
MY DEAR LADY HAMILTON MANY THANKS TO YOU AND SIR WILLIAM FOR YOUR KIND NOTES
MARCH EIGHTEEN O ONE HAVING MY TRULY DEAREST FRIEND GOT THROUGH A GREAT DEAL OF BUSINESS I AM ENABLED TO DO JUSTICE TO MY PRIVATE FEELINGS WHICH ARE FIXED EVER ON YOU AND ABOUT YOU WHENEVER THE PUBLIC SERVICE DOES NOT ARREST MY ATTENTION

ONLY THINK OF TYSON'S BEING LEFT MAY GOD BLESS YOU MY DEAR LADY AND BELIEVE ME EVER YOUR TRULY AFFECTIONATE AND SINCERE FRIEND NELSON LADY HAMILTON PUT THE CANDLESTICK ON MY WRITING TABLE
WHO BROKE ALL THE SNARES AND ROPES BEING GONE FROM THENCE THEY LAY ALL THE REST OF THAT NIGHT IN A LODGE NEAR UNTO COUDRAY WHERE THEY WERE COMFORTED IN THEIR MISERIES BY THE GRACIOUS WORDS OF ONE OF THEIR COMPANY CALLED SWEER TO GO WHO SHOWED THEM THAT THIS ADVENTURE HAD BEEN FORETOLD BY THE PROPHET DAVID PSALM
HOWEVER I UNDERSTAND THE TRIM OF OUR ENGLISH SHIPS BETTER BALL WILL HAVE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BLOCKADE AFTER MY DEPARTURE AS IT SEEMS THE COURT OF NAPLES THINK MY PRESENCE MAY BE NECESSARY AND USEFUL IN THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER I HOPE IT WILL PROVE SO
BUT I FEEL MY DUTY LAYS AT PRESENT IN THE EAST FOR UNTIL I KNOW THE SHIPPING IN EGYPT ARE DESTROYED I SHALL NEVER CONSIDER THE FRENCH ARMY AS COMPLETELY SURE OF NEVER RETURNING TO EUROPE HOWEVER ALL MY VIEWS ARE TO SERVE AND SAVE THE TWO SICILIES
AS OFFENSIVE TO HIM WHY SHOULD IT ONLY THAT MISTER DAVISON WISHES THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUSTICE DONE ME AND NOT TO BE OVERPOWERED BY WEIGHT OF INTEREST AND MONEY ONCE MORE GOD BLESS YOU AND SIR WILLIAM N AND B
THEY SHELTERED THEMSELVES FROM THE DANGER OF THAT INUNDATION UNDER THE BANKS OF HIS TEETH BUT ONE OF THEM BY CHANCE GROPING OR SOUNDING THE COUNTRY WITH HIS STAFF TO TRY WHETHER THEY WERE IN SAFETY OR NO STRUCK HARD AGAINST THE CLEFT OF A HOLLOW TOOTH AND HIT THE MANDIBULARY SINEW
GARGANTUA FINDING HIMSELF SOMEWHAT DRY ASKED WHETHER THEY COULD GET ANY LETTUCE TO MAKE HIM A SALAD AND HEARING THAT THERE WERE THE GREATEST AND FAIREST IN THE COUNTRY FOR THEY WERE AS GREAT AS PLUM TREES OR AS WALNUT TREES HE WOULD GO THITHER HIMSELF
I ONLY WANT TO KNOW YOUR WISHES THAT I MAY AT LEAST APPEAR GRATEFUL BY ATTENDING TO THEM MY HEAD ACHES DREADFULLY AND I HAVE NONE HERE TO GIVE ME A MOMENT'S COMFORT
BUT IT MAY NEVER GET TO ANY OF THEM FOR THE OLD PATENT MAY EXTEND BY ISSUE MALE OF MY OWN CARCASE
AND HE HAS THE KING'S ORDERS FOR MINE AS MUCH AS THE OTHERS
YOUR'S ALL CAME SAFE BUT THE NUMBERING OF THEM WILL POINT OUT DIRECTLY IF ONE IS MISSING I DO NOT THINK THAT ANY THING VERY PARTICULAR WAS IN THAT LETTER WHICH IS LOST
ONLY DO AS I DO AND ALL WILL BE WELL AND YOU WILL BE EVERY THING I WISH I THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO POOR DEAR MISSUS THOMSON I SEND HER A NOTE AS DESIRED BY HER DEAR GOOD FRIEND WHO DOATS ON HER
WHAT RASCALS YOUR POST CHAISE PEOPLE MUST BE THEY HAVE BEEN PAID EVERY THING
YESTERDAY THE SUBJECT TURNED ON THE COW POX A GENTLEMAN DECLARED THAT HIS CHILD WAS INOCULATED WITH THE COW POX AND AFTERWARDS REMAINED IN A HOUSE WHERE A CHILD HAD THE SMALL POX THE NATURAL WAY AND DID NOT CATCH IT THEREFORE HERE WAS A FULL TRIAL WITH THE COW POX
ERE THY TRUE HENRY'S CONSTANT LOVE OR EBB OR CHANGE SHALL KNOW THE WEATHER THANK GOD IS MODERATING
BUT IF WE SPEAK HE WILL KILL US FOR SPIES AND AS THEY WERE THUS DELIBERATING WHAT TO DO GARGANTUA PUT THEM WITH THE LETTUCE INTO A PLATTER OF THE HOUSE AS LARGE AS THE HUGE TUN OF THE WHITE FRIARS OF THE CISTERCIAN ORDER WHICH DONE WITH OIL VINEGAR AND SALT
WHEN WE WERE EATEN IN THE SALAD WITH SALT OIL AND VINEGAR QUUM IRASCERETUR FUROR EORUM IN NOS FORSITAN AQUA
THEN HE LISTENED PATIENTLY PROMISED TO EXAMINE INTO HIS AFFAIR AT THE SKIPPER'S RETURN AND ORDERED HIM TO PAY TEN THOUSAND PIASTRES FOR THE EXPENSE OF THE HEARING
UPON CONDITION THAT THIS MAN WAS THE MOST DISSATISFIED WITH HIS STATE AND THE MOST UNFORTUNATE IN THE WHOLE PROVINCE SUCH A CROWD OF CANDIDATES PRESENTED THEMSELVES THAT A FLEET OF SHIPS COULD HARDLY HAVE HELD THEM
THE GIRL BLUSHED
WAS MUCH SURPRISED AT WHAT HE HEARD MARTIN FOUND THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF REASON IN POCOCURANTE'S REMARKS
I GRANT SAID THE SENATOR
I WISH SAID MARTIN SHE MAY ONE DAY MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY BUT I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH
INSTEAD OF HER I HAVE ONLY MET A PARISIAN WENCH AND A PERIGORDIAN ABBE CUNEGONDE IS DEAD WITHOUT DOUBT AND THERE IS NOTHING FOR ME BUT TO DIE ALAS HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR ME TO HAVE REMAINED IN THE PARADISE OF EL DORADO
I WAS OBLIGED TO QUIT THE CASTLE SOME TIME AFTER THE BARON HAD SENT YOU AWAY WITH KICKS ON THE BACKSIDE IF A FAMOUS SURGEON HAD NOT TAKEN COMPASSION ON ME I SHOULD HAVE DIED FOR SOME TIME I WAS THIS SURGEON'S MISTRESS MERELY OUT OF GRATITUDE
YES SIR SAID THE NEGRO IT IS THE CUSTOM THEY GIVE US A PAIR OF LINEN DRAWERS FOR OUR WHOLE GARMENT TWICE A YEAR WHEN WE WORK AT THE SUGAR CANES AND THE MILL SNATCHES HOLD OF A FINGER
HIS WIFE WHO WAS MAD WITH JEALOUSY BEAT ME EVERY DAY UNMERCIFULLY SHE WAS A FURY THE SURGEON WAS ONE OF THE UGLIEST OF MEN
THOU HADST NOT GUESSED AT THIS ABOMINATION IT IS THE END I MUST AT LAST RENOUNCE THY OPTIMISM WHAT IS THIS OPTIMISM SAID CACAMBO
MY FRIEND YOU SEE HOW PERISHABLE ARE THE RICHES OF THIS WORLD THERE IS NOTHING SOLID BUT VIRTUE
HIS INSIPID LAVINIA I THINK THERE CAN BE NOTHING MORE FLAT AND DISAGREEABLE I PREFER TASSO A GOOD DEAL OR EVEN THE SOPORIFIC TALES OF ARIOSTO
AND OTHERS SUBSEQUENTLY FELL DOWN PRECIPICES AT LENGTH AFTER TRAVELLING A HUNDRED DAYS ONLY TWO SHEEP REMAINED
HE IS SO DEEPLY CONCERNED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THIS WORLD ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE MAY VERY WELL BE IN ME AS WELL AS IN EVERYBODY ELSE
HE HAD INDEED ENDURED MISFORTUNES A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE
AT LENGTH ONE LET OFF A BROADSIDE SO LOW AND SO TRULY AIMED THAT THE OTHER SANK TO THE BOTTOM
JEALOUSY DISCORD AND FURY DWELL IN THE CONVENT IT IS TRUE I HAVE PREACHED A FEW BAD SERMONS THAT HAVE BROUGHT ME IN A LITTLE MONEY OF WHICH THE PRIOR STOLE HALF WHILE THE REST SERVES TO MAINTAIN MY GIRLS
AND FLUNG HIM INTO A DEEP MELANCHOLY THE VILLAINY OF MANKIND PRESENTED ITSELF BEFORE HIS IMAGINATION IN ALL ITS DEFORMITY AND HIS MIND WAS FILLED WITH GLOOMY IDEAS AT LENGTH HEARING THAT A FRENCH VESSEL WAS READY TO SET SAIL FOR BORDEAUX
PROMISING TO CHOOSE HIM WHO APPEARED TO BE MOST JUSTLY DISCONTENTED WITH HIS STATE AND TO BESTOW SOME PRESENTS UPON THE REST THEY SAT UNTIL FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
I HAVE SEEN SO MUCH AND EXPERIENCED SO MUCH THAT I AM A MANICHEAN
YOU KNOW SIR WHAT A DANGEROUS THING IT IS FOR AN ILL NATURED WOMAN TO BE MARRIED TO A DOCTOR INCENSED AT THE BEHAVIOUR OF HIS WIFE HE ONE DAY GAVE HER SO EFFECTUAL A REMEDY TO CURE HER OF A SLIGHT COLD
UPON HIS LIPS TOLD THE SPANIARD ALL HIS ADVENTURES
FOOLS ADMIRE EVERYTHING IN AN AUTHOR OF REPUTATION FOR MY PART I READ ONLY TO PLEASE MYSELF I LIKE ONLY THAT WHICH SERVES MY PURPOSE
AS HE HAD NO SHEEP LADEN WITH DIAMONDS TO TAKE ALONG WITH HIM HE HIRED A CABIN AT THE USUAL PRICE HE MADE IT KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT HE WOULD PAY THE PASSAGE AND BOARD AND GIVE TWO THOUSAND PIASTRES TO ANY HONEST MAN WHO WOULD MAKE THE VOYAGE WITH HIM
AY SAID THE SKIPPER TO HIMSELF THIS MAN AGREES TO PAY TWENTY THOUSAND PIASTRES WITH AS MUCH EASE AS TEN HE WENT BACK TO HIM AGAIN AND DECLARED THAT HE COULD NOT CARRY HIM TO VENICE FOR LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PIASTRES
THE SECOND DAY TWO OF THEIR SHEEP PLUNGED INTO A MORASS WHERE THEY AND THEIR BURDENS WERE LOST TWO MORE DIED OF FATIGUE A FEW DAYS AFTER SEVEN OR EIGHT PERISHED WITH HUNGER IN A DESERT
AFTER HE HAD HIRED DOMESTICS AND PURCHASED EVERYTHING NECESSARY FOR A LONG VOYAGE
HERE IS THE GREAT MAN WHOM I FANCY YOU ARE NEVER TIRED OF READING I NEVER READ HIM REPLIED THE VENETIAN WHAT IS IT TO ME WHETHER HE PLEADS FOR RABIRIUS OR CLUENTIUS I TRY CAUSES ENOUGH MYSELF
HE LET HIM KNOW THAT UPON SECOND CONSIDERATION HE COULD NOT UNDERTAKE THE VOYAGE FOR LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND PIASTRES
BUT RECOLLECTING HER AS SHE SPOKE ALAS SAID HE MY POOR CHILD IT IS YOU WHO REDUCED DOCTOR PANGLOSS TO THE BEAUTIFUL CONDITION IN WHICH I SAW HIM ALAS IT WAS I SIR INDEED ANSWERED PAQUETTE
AT LENGTH HE MADE CHOICE OF A POOR MAN OF LETTERS WHO HAD WORKED TEN YEARS FOR THE BOOKSELLERS OF AMSTERDAM HE JUDGED THAT THERE WAS NOT IN THE WHOLE WORLD A TRADE WHICH COULD DISGUST ONE MORE
A MILLION REGIMENTED ASSASSINS FROM ONE EXTREMITY OF EUROPE TO THE OTHER GET THEIR BREAD BY DISCIPLINED DEPREDATION AND MURDER FOR WANT OF MORE HONEST EMPLOYMENT EVEN IN THOSE CITIES WHICH SEEM TO ENJOY PEACE
YOU WILL AGREE THAT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS FOR HE IS ABOVE EVERYTHING HE POSSESSES BUT DO YOU NOT SEE ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE IS DISGUSTED WITH ALL HE POSSESSES
I SHOULD BE HANGED AND SO WOULD YOU THE FAIR CUNEGONDE IS MY LORD'S FAVOURITE MISTRESS
THE GARDENS LAID OUT WITH TASTE WERE ADORNED WITH FINE MARBLE STATUES THE PALACE WAS BEAUTIFULLY BUILT THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS A MAN OF SIXTY AND VERY RICH HE RECEIVED THE TWO TRAVELLERS WITH POLITE INDIFFERENCE
THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE WITH PAQUETTE AND THE THEATIN THE REPAST WAS ENTERTAINING AND TOWARDS THE END THEY CONVERSED WITH ALL CONFIDENCE
WHAT ART THOU DOING THERE FRIEND IN THAT SHOCKING CONDITION I AM WAITING FOR MY MASTER MYNHEER VANDERDENDUR THE FAMOUS MERCHANT ANSWERED THE NEGRO
THEY HAD BOTH SEEN AND SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL
THERE MIGHT BE SAID POCOCURANTE IF ONLY ONE OF THOSE RAKERS OF RUBBISH HAD SHOWN HOW TO MAKE PINS
CANDIDE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM COMMENDING THEIR BEAUTY GRACE AND ADDRESS THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH CREATURES SAID THE SENATOR I MAKE THEM LIE WITH ME SOMETIMES FOR I AM VERY TIRED OF THE LADIES OF THE TOWN OF THEIR COQUETRIES
AND MARTIN CONTINUED TO PROVE TO HIM THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE VIRTUE OR HAPPINESS UPON EARTH EXCEPT PERHAPS IN EL DORADO WHERE NOBODY COULD GAIN ADMITTANCE WHILE THEY WERE DISPUTING ON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT
DIE AWAY WITH PLEASURE AT THE SIGHT OF AN EUNUCH QUAVERING THE ROLE OF CAESAR OR OF CATO AND STRUTTING AWKWARDLY UPON THE STAGE FOR MY PART I HAVE LONG SINCE RENOUNCED THOSE PALTRY ENTERTAINMENTS
I HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE FRIGHTFUL DISASTERS THAT BEFELL THE FAMILY OF MY LADY BARONESS
WHEREAS MARTIN HAD NOTHING AT ALL TO HOPE BESIDES CANDIDE WAS POSSESSED OF MONEY AND JEWELS
AND AMONG ALL THE LADIES OF PLEASURE BUT TO NO PURPOSE HE SENT EVERY DAY TO INQUIRE ON ALL THE SHIPS THAT CAME IN BUT THERE WAS NO NEWS OF CACAMBO WHAT SAID HE TO MARTIN I HAVE HAD TIME TO VOYAGE FROM SURINAM TO BORDEAUX
THE FRENCH AND SPANISH SHIPS CONTINUED THEIR COURSE AND CANDIDE CONTINUED HIS CONVERSATION WITH MARTIN THEY DISPUTED FIFTEEN SUCCESSIVE DAYS AND ON THE LAST OF THOSE FIFTEEN DAYS THEY WERE AS FAR ADVANCED AS ON THE FIRST
ASKED WHETHER HE DID NOT LOOK UPON THIS AUTHOR AS A GREAT MAN WHO SAID POCOCURANTE THAT BARBARIAN WHO WRITES A LONG COMMENTARY IN TEN BOOKS OF HARSH VERSE ON THE FIRST CHAPTER OF GENESIS
WAS REMINDED OF WHAT THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID TO HIM IN THEIR VOYAGE TO BUENOS AYRES AND OF HER WAGER THAT THERE WAS NOT A PERSON ON BOARD THE SHIP BUT HAD MET WITH VERY GREAT MISFORTUNES HE DREAMED OF PANGLOSS AT EVERY ADVENTURE TOLD TO HIM
I CONCLUDED THAT I KNEW AS MUCH AS HE AND THAT I HAD NO NEED OF A GUIDE TO LEARN IGNORANCE HA HERE ARE FOUR SCORE VOLUMES OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CRIED MARTIN PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING VALUABLE IN THIS COLLECTION
I SEE THAT WE OFTEN MEET WITH THOSE WHOM WE EXPECTED NEVER TO SEE MORE SO THAT PERHAPS AS I HAVE FOUND MY RED SHEEP AND PAQUETTE IT MAY WELL BE THAT I SHALL ALSO FIND CUNEGONDE
BUT I CARE LITTLE FOR HIS JOURNEY TO BRUNDUSIUM AND HIS ACCOUNT OF A BAD DINNER OR OF HIS LOW QUARREL BETWEEN ONE RUPILIUS WHOSE WORDS HE SAYS WERE FULL OF POISONOUS FILTH AND ANOTHER WHOSE LANGUAGE WAS IMBUED WITH VINEGAR
IN ALL OUR ITALY WE WRITE ONLY WHAT WE DO NOT THINK THOSE WHO INHABIT THE COUNTRY OF THE CAESARS AND THE ANTONINUSES
ALAS SAID HE THIS IS A TRICK WORTHY OF THE OLD WORLD HE PUT BACK OVERWHELMED WITH SORROW FOR INDEED HE HAD LOST SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THE FORTUNE OF TWENTY MONARCHS HE WAITED UPON THE DUTCH MAGISTRATE
HE WEPT FOR A LONG WHILE AT LAST HE DREW CACAMBO ASIDE HERE MY DEAR FRIEND SAID HE TO HIM THIS THOU MUST DO WE HAVE EACH OF US IN HIS POCKET FIVE OR SIX MILLIONS IN DIAMONDS
BUT WITH DISCRETION MARTIN WAS ENTIRELY OF THE SENATOR'S OPINION THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE AND AFTER AN EXCELLENT DINNER THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
ARE THEY NOT PERPETUALLY SINGING YOU DO NOT SEE THEM SAID MARTIN AT HOME WITH THEIR WIVES AND BRATS THE DOGE HAS HIS TROUBLES THE GONDOLIERS HAVE THEIRS
THEY RAISED THEIR HANDS TO HEAVEN AND UTTERED TERRIBLE OUTCRIES AND THE NEXT MOMENT WERE SWALLOWED UP BY THE SEA WELL SAID MARTIN THIS IS HOW MEN TREAT ONE ANOTHER
TO BE OFTEN REDUCED TO BORROWING A PETTICOAT ONLY TO GO AND HAVE IT RAISED BY A DISAGREEABLE MAN TO BE ROBBED BY ONE OF WHAT ONE HAS EARNED FROM ANOTHER TO BE SUBJECT TO THE EXTORTIONS OF THE OFFICERS OF JUSTICE
THAT IS TO SAY REPLIED MARTIN THAT THERE IS SOME PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE WELL WELL SAID CANDIDE I FIND THAT I SHALL BE THE ONLY HAPPY MAN WHEN I AM BLESSED WITH THE SIGHT OF MY DEAR CUNEGONDE IT IS ALWAYS WELL TO HOPE SAID MARTIN
HOLDING A GIRL ON HIS ARM THE THEATIN LOOKED FRESH COLOURED PLUMP AND VIGOROUS HIS EYES WERE SPARKLING HIS AIR ASSURED HIS LOOK LOFTY AND HIS STEP BOLD THE GIRL WAS VERY PRETTY AND SANG
PLATO OBSERVED A LONG WHILE AGO THAT THOSE STOMACHS ARE NOT THE BEST THAT REJECT ALL SORTS OF FOOD
THERE SAID HE IS A BOOK THAT WAS ONCE THE DELIGHT OF THE GREAT PANGLOSS THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN GERMANY IT IS NOT MINE ANSWERED POCOCURANTE COOLLY THEY USED AT ONE TIME TO MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT I TOOK A PLEASURE IN READING HIM
AND WHERE THE ARTS FLOURISH THE INHABITANTS ARE DEVOURED BY MORE ENVY CARE AND UNEASINESS THAN ARE EXPERIENCED BY A BESIEGED TOWN SECRET GRIEFS ARE MORE CRUEL THAN PUBLIC CALAMITIES IN A WORD
AND I ONLY TREAT IT NOW AS IT WAS TREATED IN ITS OWN COUNTRY BY CONTEMPORARIES FOR THE MATTER OF THAT I SAY WHAT I THINK AND I CARE VERY LITTLE WHETHER OTHERS THINK AS I DO
TOWARDS THE LATTER END OF A REPAST HE INCLINED TO PANGLOSS'S DOCTRINE BUT YOU MISTER MARTIN SAID HE TO THE PHILOSOPHER WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ALL THIS WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS ON MORAL AND NATURAL EVIL
OUR TRAVELLERS SPENT THE FIRST DAY VERY AGREEABLY THEY WERE DELIGHTED WITH POSSESSING MORE TREASURE THAN ALL ASIA EUROPE AND AFRICA COULD SCRAPE TOGETHER
I'LL ANSWER FOR IT SAID HE THAT WITH THIS THEY WILL BE HAPPY
HERE AND THERE I SAW SNAKES AND ONE RAISED HIS HEAD FROM A LEDGE OF ROCK AND HISSED AT ME WITH A NOISE NOT UNLIKE THE SPINNING OF A TOP LITTLE DID I SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS A DEADLY ENEMY AND THAT THE NOISE WAS THE FAMOUS RATTLE
THEN IT GOT DOWN OFF THE MUSHROOM AND CRAWLED AWAY IN THE GRASS MERELY REMARKING AS IT WENT ONE SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW TALLER AND THE OTHER SIDE WILL MAKE YOU GROW SHORTER ONE SIDE OF WHAT
FOR HER NECK KEPT GETTING ENTANGLED AMONG THE BRANCHES AND EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE HAD TO STOP AND UNTWIST IT AFTER A WHILE SHE REMEMBERED THAT SHE STILL HELD THE PIECES OF MUSHROOM IN HER HANDS AND SHE SET TO WORK VERY CAREFULLY
AND THE SURF THAT WE COULD BOTH SEE AND HEAR FOAMING AND THUNDERING ON THE STEEP BEACH AT LEAST ALTHOUGH THE SUN SHONE BRIGHT AND HOT AND THE SHORE BIRDS WERE FISHING AND CRYING ALL AROUND US
WHICH SHE FOUND TO BE NOTHING BUT THE TOPS OF THE TREES UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN WANDERING WHEN A SHARP HISS MADE HER DRAW BACK IN A HURRY A LARGE PIGEON HAD FLOWN INTO HER FACE AND WAS BEATING HER VIOLENTLY WITH ITS WINGS SERPENT SCREAMED THE PIGEON
HEARKENING AS SILENT AS A MOUSE ANOTHER VOICE ANSWERED AND THEN THE FIRST VOICE WHICH I NOW RECOGNIZED TO BE SILVER'S ONCE MORE TOOK UP THE STORY AND RAN ON FOR A LONG WHILE IN A STREAM
MY LADS SAID HE WE'VE HAD A HOT DAY AND ARE ALL TIRED AND OUT OF SORTS A TURN ASHORE'LL HURT NOBODY THE BOATS ARE STILL IN THE WATER YOU CAN TAKE THE GIGS AND AS MANY AS PLEASE MAY GO ASHORE FOR THE AFTERNOON
NOT YOU AS SURE AS GOD SEES ME I'D SOONER LOSE MY HAND IF I TURN AGIN MY DOOTY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A NOISE I HAD FOUND ONE OF THE HONEST HANDS WELL
CHAPTER FIVE ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR THE CATERPILLAR AND ALICE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE AT LAST THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH
AND JUST AS I WAS THINKING I SHOULD BE FREE OF THEM AT LAST THEY MUST NEEDS COME WRIGGLING DOWN FROM THE SKY UGH SERPENT BUT I'M NOT A SERPENT I TELL YOU SAID ALICE I'M A I'M A WELL WHAT ARE YOU SAID THE PIGEON
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A VERY BAD SIGN FOR UP TO THAT DAY THE MEN HAD GONE BRISKLY AND WILLINGLY ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS BUT THE VERY SIGHT OF THE ISLAND HAD RELAXED THE CORDS OF DISCIPLINE ALL THE WAY IN LONG JOHN STOOD BY THE STEERSMAN AND CONNED THE SHIP
WELL IF I SPEAK BACK PIKES WILL BE GOING IN TWO SHAKES IF I DON'T SILVER WILL SEE THERE'S SOMETHING UNDER THAT AND THE GAME'S UP NOW WE'VE ONLY ONE MAN TO RELY ON AND WHO IS THAT ASKED THE SQUIRE SILVER SIR RETURNED THE CAPTAIN
AND NOW WHICH IS WHICH SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND NIBBLED A LITTLE OF THE RIGHT HAND BIT TO TRY THE EFFECT THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FELT A VIOLENT BLOW UNDERNEATH HER CHIN IT HAD STRUCK HER FOOT
COME BACK THE CATERPILLAR CALLED AFTER HER I'VE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS SOUNDED PROMISING CERTAINLY ALICE TURNED AND CAME BACK AGAIN KEEP YOUR TEMPER SAID THE CATERPILLAR
ANOTHER FOLLOWED AND SOON OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE MARSH A GREAT CLOUD OF BIRDS HUNG SCREAMING AND CIRCLING IN THE AIR I JUDGED AT ONCE THAT SOME OF MY SHIPMATES MUST BE DRAWING NEAR ALONG THE BORDERS OF THE FEN NOR WAS I DECEIVED
BUT HE WAS NOT DESTINED TO GO FAR WITH A CRY JOHN SEIZED THE BRANCH OF A TREE WHIPPED THE CRUTCH OUT OF HIS ARMPIT AND SENT THAT UNCOUTH MISSILE HURTLING THROUGH THE AIR IT STRUCK POOR TOM POINT FOREMOST
YET YOU FINISHED THE GOOSE WITH THE BONES AND THE BEAK PRAY HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO DO IT IN MY YOUTH SAID HIS FATHER I TOOK TO THE LAW AND ARGUED EACH CASE WITH MY WIFE AND THE MUSCULAR STRENGTH WHICH IT GAVE TO MY JAW HAS LASTED THE REST OF MY LIFE
THE ROCKS OF THE SPY GLASS RE ECHOED IT A SCORE OF TIMES THE WHOLE TROOP OF MARSH BIRDS ROSE AGAIN DARKENING HEAVEN WITH A SIMULTANEOUS WHIRR AND LONG AFTER THAT DEATH YELL WAS STILL RINGING IN MY BRAIN
GOOD BYE TO THE SQUIRE THE DOCTOR AND THE CAPTAIN THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR ME BUT DEATH BY STARVATION OR DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THE MUTINEERS ALL THIS WHILE AS I SAY I WAS STILL RUNNING
WOULD NOT MY ABSENCE ITSELF BE AN EVIDENCE TO THEM OF MY ALARM AND THEREFORE OF MY FATAL KNOWLEDGE IT WAS ALL OVER I THOUGHT
SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL FRIGHTENED BY THIS VERY SUDDEN CHANGE BUT SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST AS SHE WAS SHRINKING RAPIDLY SO SHE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO EAT SOME OF THE OTHER BIT HER CHIN WAS PRESSED SO CLOSELY AGAINST HER FOOT
WHEN THE GUN FIRED HOW SHOULD I DARE TO GO DOWN TO THE BOATS AMONG THOSE FIENDS STILL SMOKING FROM THEIR CRIME WOULD NOT THE FIRST OF THEM WHO SAW ME WRING MY NECK LIKE A SNIPE'S
THIS EVEN TINT WAS INDEED BROKEN UP BY STREAKS OF YELLOW SAND BREAK IN THE LOWER LANDS AND BY MANY TALL TREES OF THE PINE FAMILY OUT TOPPING THE OTHERS SOME SINGLY SOME IN CLUMPS BUT THE GENERAL COLOURING WAS UNIFORM AND SAD
LOADED PISTOLS WERE SERVED OUT TO ALL THE SURE MEN HUNTER JOYCE AND REDRUTH WERE TAKEN INTO OUR CONFIDENCE AND RECEIVED THE NEWS WITH LESS SURPRISE AND A BETTER SPIRIT THAN WE HAD LOOKED FOR AND THEN THE CAPTAIN WENT ON DECK AND ADDRESSED THE CREW
I COULD HEAR HAILS COMING AND GOING BETWEEN THE OLD BUCCANEER AND HIS COMRADES AND THIS SOUND OF DANGER LENT ME WINGS AS SOON AS I WAS CLEAR OF THE THICKET I RAN AS I NEVER RAN BEFORE SCARCE MINDING THE DIRECTION OF MY FLIGHT
THE HEAT WAS SWELTERING AND THE MEN GRUMBLED FIERCELY OVER THEIR WORK ANDERSON WAS IN COMMAND OF MY BOAT AND INSTEAD OF KEEPING THE CREW IN ORDER HE GRUMBLED AS LOUD AS THE WORST WELL HE SAID WITH AN OATH IT'S NOT FOREVER
IN A JIFFY I HAD SLIPPED OVER THE SIDE AND CURLED UP IN THE FORE SHEETS OF THE NEAREST BOAT AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT SHE SHOVED OFF NO ONE TOOK NOTICE OF ME ONLY THE BOW OAR SAYING IS THAT YOU JIM KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN
ALICE WAS MORE AND MORE PUZZLED BUT SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO USE IN SAYING ANYTHING MORE TILL THE PIGEON HAD FINISHED AS IF IT WASN'T TROUBLE ENOUGH HATCHING THE EGGS SAID THE PIGEON BUT I MUST BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR SERPENTS NIGHT AND DAY
BUT YOU MAY SUPPOSE I PAID NO HEED
THAT IT FELT QUITE STRANGE AT FIRST BUT SHE GOT USED TO IT IN A FEW MINUTES AND BEGAN TALKING TO HERSELF AS USUAL COME THERE'S HALF MY PLAN DONE NOW HOW PUZZLING ALL THESE CHANGES ARE I'M NEVER SURE WHAT I'M GOING TO BE FROM ONE MINUTE TO ANOTHER
AND ADDRESSED HER IN A LANGUID SLEEPY VOICE WHO ARE YOU SAID THE CATERPILLAR THIS WAS NOT AN ENCOURAGING OPENING FOR A CONVERSATION ALICE REPLIED RATHER SHYLY I
WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FIRST THAT HAD EVER ANCHORED THERE SINCE THE ISLAND AROSE OUT OF THE SEAS THERE WAS NOT A BREATH OF AIR MOVING NOR A SOUND BUT THAT OF THE SURF BOOMING HALF A MILE AWAY ALONG THE BEACHES AND AGAINST THE ROCKS OUTSIDE
I HARDLY KNOW SIR JUST AT PRESENT AT LEAST I KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I GOT UP THIS MORNING BUT I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT SAID THE CATERPILLAR STERNLY EXPLAIN YOURSELF
IT WAS EXACTLY THREE INCHES HIGH BUT I'M NOT USED TO IT PLEADED POOR ALICE IN A PITEOUS TONE AND SHE THOUGHT OF HERSELF I WISH THE CREATURES WOULDN'T BE SO EASILY OFFENDED YOU'LL GET USED TO IT IN TIME SAID THE CATERPILLAR
THE SUN STILL SHINING MERCILESSLY ON THE STEAMING MARSH AND THE TALL PINNACLE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND I COULD SCARCE PERSUADE MYSELF THAT MURDER HAD BEEN ACTUALLY DONE AND A HUMAN LIFE CRUELLY CUT SHORT A MOMENT SINCE BEFORE MY EYES
HUNG OVER US LIKE A THUNDER CLOUD AND IT WAS NOT ONLY WE OF THE CABIN PARTY WHO PERCEIVED THE DANGER LONG JOHN WAS HARD AT WORK GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP SPENDING HIMSELF IN GOOD ADVICE AND AS FOR EXAMPLE NO MAN COULD HAVE SHOWN A BETTER
YOU ARE OLD SAID THE YOUTH ONE WOULD HARDLY SUPPOSE THAT YOUR EYE WAS AS STEADY AS EVER YET YOU BALANCED AN EEL ON THE END OF YOUR NOSE WHAT MADE YOU SO AWFULLY CLEVER
I'M NOT A SERPENT SAID ALICE INDIGNANTLY LET ME ALONE SERPENT I SAY AGAIN REPEATED THE PIGEON BUT IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE AND ADDED WITH A KIND OF SOB I'VE TRIED EVERY WAY AND NOTHING SEEMS TO SUIT THEM
MINGLED WITH THESE WERE A FEW SCATTERED PINES SOME FIFTY SOME NEARER SEVENTY FEET HIGH THE AIR TOO SMELT MORE FRESHLY THAN DOWN BESIDE THE MARSH
FOR I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF TO BEGIN WITH AND BEING SO MANY DIFFERENT SIZES IN A DAY IS VERY CONFUSING IT ISN'T SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT SO YET SAID ALICE
AND THE BOATS HAD TO BE GOT OUT AND MANNED AND THE SHIP WARPED THREE OR FOUR MILES ROUND THE CORNER OF THE ISLAND AND UP THE NARROW PASSAGE TO THE HAVEN BEHIND SKELETON ISLAND I VOLUNTEERED FOR ONE OF THE BOATS WHERE I HAD OF COURSE NO BUSINESS
IF THEY NONE OF THEM GO WELL THEN WE HOLD THE CABIN AND GOD DEFEND THE RIGHT IF SOME GO YOU MARK MY WORDS SIR SILVER'LL BRING EM ABOARD AGAIN AS MILD AS LAMBS IT WAS SO DECIDED
HE FAIRLY OUTSTRIPPED HIMSELF IN WILLINGNESS AND CIVILITY HE WAS ALL SMILES TO EVERYONE IF AN ORDER WERE GIVEN
WHICH BROUGHT THEM BACK AGAIN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION ALICE FELT A LITTLE IRRITATED AT THE CATERPILLAR'S MAKING SUCH VERY SHORT REMARKS AND SHE DREW HERSELF UP AND SAID VERY GRAVELY I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME WHO YOU ARE FIRST
SAID ALICE ALL I KNOW IS IT WOULD FEEL VERY QUEER TO ME YOU SAID THE CATERPILLAR CONTEMPTUOUSLY
HE KNEW THE PASSAGE LIKE THE PALM OF HIS HAND AND THOUGH THE MAN IN THE CHAINS GOT EVERYWHERE MORE WATER THAN WAS DOWN IN THE CHART JOHN NEVER HESITATED ONCE THERE'S A STRONG SCOUR WITH THE EBB HE SAID
AND AT THIS POINT TOM FLASHED OUT LIKE A HERO ALAN HE CRIED THEN REST HIS SOUL FOR A TRUE SEAMAN AND AS FOR YOU JOHN SILVER LONG YOU'VE BEEN A MATE OF MINE BUT YOU'RE MATE OF MINE NO MORE
AND WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE I HAD DRAWN NEAR TO THE FOOT OF THE LITTLE HILL WITH THE TWO PEAKS AND HAD GOT INTO A PART OF THE ISLAND WHERE THE LIVE OAKS GREW MORE WIDELY APART AND SEEMED MORE LIKE FOREST TREES IN THEIR BEARING AND DIMENSIONS
NIBBLING FIRST AT ONE AND THEN AT THE OTHER AND GROWING SOMETIMES TALLER AND SOMETIMES SHORTER UNTIL SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING HERSELF DOWN TO HER USUAL HEIGHT IT WAS SO LONG SINCE SHE HAD BEEN ANYTHING NEAR THE RIGHT SIZE
THAT SINCE I HAD BEEN SO FOOLHARDY AS TO COME ASHORE WITH THESE DESPERADOES THE LEAST I COULD DO WAS TO OVERHEAR THEM AT THEIR COUNCILS AND THAT MY PLAIN AND OBVIOUS DUTY WAS TO DRAW AS CLOSE AS I COULD MANAGE UNDER THE FAVOURABLE AMBUSH OF THE CROUCHING TREES
BUT I'LL STAKE MY WIG THERE'S FEVER HERE IF THE CONDUCT OF THE MEN HAD BEEN ALARMING IN THE BOAT IT BECAME TRULY THREATENING WHEN THEY HAD COME ABOARD THEY LAY ABOUT THE DECK GROWLING TOGETHER IN TALK
APPEARED THE WORST WE HELD A COUNCIL IN THE CABIN SIR SAID THE CAPTAIN IF I RISK ANOTHER ORDER THE WHOLE SHIP'LL COME ABOUT OUR EARS BY THE RUN YOU SEE SIR HERE IT IS I GET A ROUGH ANSWER DO I NOT
I'VE TRIED TO SAY HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE BUT IT ALL CAME DIFFERENT ALICE REPLIED IN A VERY MELANCHOLY VOICE REPEAT YOU ARE OLD FATHER WILLIAM SAID THE CATERPILLAR ALICE FOLDED HER HANDS AND BEGAN
IF SIX MEN WERE LEFT BY SILVER IT WAS PLAIN OUR PARTY COULD NOT TAKE AND FIGHT THE SHIP AND SINCE ONLY SIX WERE LEFT IT WAS EQUALLY PLAIN THAT THE CABIN PARTY HAD NO PRESENT NEED OF MY ASSISTANCE IT OCCURRED TO ME AT ONCE TO GO ASHORE
WHO HAD A SON CALLED CIENZO IT HAPPENED THAT CIENZO WAS ONE DAY THROWING STONES ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE SON OF THE KING OF NAPLES AND BY CHANCE BROKE HIS COMPANION'S HEAD WHEN HE TOLD HIS FATHER
ARRIVED AT THE COURT WHERE HE PRESENTED THE HORSE TO THE KING THEN THE KING EMBRACED HIM MORE THAN A SON AND PULLING OUT HIS PURSE FILLED HIS HANDS WITH CROWN PIECES AT THIS THE RAGE OF THE COURTIERS KNEW NO BOUNDS
AND LET HIM WHO IS AFRAID TURN CONSTABLE BUT ANTONIELLO WOULD NOT LISTEN TO REASON HE MADE SURE THE KING WOULD KILL CIENZO FOR HIS FAULT AND SAID DON'T STAND HERE AT RISK OF YOUR LIFE BUT MARCH OFF THIS VERY INSTANT
HE WENT HIS WAY UNTIL THE EVENING WHEN HE CAME TO A WOOD THAT KEPT THE MULE OF THE SUN OUTSIDE ITS LIMITS WHILE IT WAS AMUSING ITSELF WITH SILENCE AND THE SHADES AN OLD HOUSE STOOD THERE AT THE FOOT OF A TOWER
WHICH MADE SUCH A FURIOUS BARKING THAT THE PRINCE SENT TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE AND WHEN HE DISCOVERED THE PRETTY LITTLE BOY WHO WAS SO YOUNG THAT HE COULD NOT TELL WHO WERE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HE ORDERED ONE OF THE HUNTSMEN TO SET HIM UPON HIS SADDLE AND TAKE HIM TO THE ROYAL PALACE
THAT IT CAN HOLD AN ARMY AND YOU WOULD NEVER BELIEVE ALL THE COURTYARDS PORTICOES COLONNADES BALCONIES AND SPIRAL CHIMNEYS WHICH THERE ARE BUILT WITH SUCH MARVELLOUS ARCHITECTURE THAT ART PRIDES HERSELF UPON THEM NATURE IS ABASHED
HE DUG A DEEP HOLE BEFORE THE ENTRANCE AND COVERING IT OVER WITH BUSHES AND EARTH HE HID HIMSELF BEHIND THE GATE AS SOON AS CORVETTO SAW THE OGRE COMING WITH HIS KINSFOLK HE SET UP A LOUD CRY IN THE COURTYARD STOP STOP
THEREUPON THE OGRE SUDDENLY STARTING UP TOLD HIS WIFE NOT TO PULL SO FOR SHE WAS DRAGGING ALL THE CLOTHES OFF HIM AND WOULD GIVE HIM HIS DEATH OF COLD
THAT HE COULD CARVE A JOINT TO A HAIR NOW ABOUT THIS TIME IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP WHO HAD TAKEN NENNELLA TO HIS HOUSE WAS A SEA ROBBER AND THE PEOPLE WISHED TO TAKE HIM PRISONER
AS THEIR SLANDER WAS NOT BELIEVED THEY THOUGHT OF LEADING HIM TO DISASTER BY THE PATH OF FLATTERY WHICH THEY ATTEMPTED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TEN MILES DISTANT FROM SCOTLAND WHERE THE SEAT OF THIS KING WAS
ASKED HER WHAT THAT PERSON WOULD DESERVE WHO SHOULD DO THEM ANY HARM AND EVEN ENDANGER THEIR LIVES AND SHE REPLIED FOR MY PART I WOULD PUT HER INTO A CLOSED CASK AND SEND HER ROLLING DOWN A MOUNTAIN
SO SAYING HE PULLED THE TONGUES OUT OF HIS POCKET WHILE THE COUNTRYMAN WAS STRUCK ALL OF A HEAP NOT KNOWING WHAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT AND THE MORE SO WHEN MENECHELLA ADDED THIS IS THE MAN AH YOU DOG OF A COUNTRYMAN A PRETTY TRICK YOU HAVE PLAYED ME
WHERE THE RECEPTION HE MET WITH FROM THE KING AND THE VEXATION OF THE COURTIERS WHO WERE BURSTING WITH SPITE ARE NOT TO BE TOLD NEVERTHELESS THEY LAID A PLAN TO FALL UPON CORVETTO WITH THE REAR GUARD OF THEIR ROGUERY AND WENT AGAIN TO THE KING
TILL THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS TURNED TOPSY TURVY WITH THE NOISE BUT CORVETTO AFTER THROWING THE CLOTHES OUT OF THE WINDOW LET HIMSELF DROP DOWN UPON THEM THEN MAKING UP A GOOD BUNDLE HE SET OUT ON THE ROAD TO THE CITY
AND GOING DOWN HE SAW A LIGHTED LAMP AND THREE GHOST LOOKING FIGURES WHO WERE MAKING A PITEOUS CLAMOUR CRYING ALAS MY BEAUTEOUS TREASURE I MUST LOSE THEE WHEN CIENZO SAW THIS
WISHED TO CLIMB UP AGAIN BUT COULD NOT FIND THE LADDER WHEREAT HE SET UP SUCH A CRY
HE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH AMAZEMENT AND ORDERED A NUMBER OF SERVANTS TO TRY WHETHER BY ANY MEANS THEY COULD ENSNARE THE FISH AND DRAW IT TO LAND AT LAST HEARING THE WORDS BROTHER BROTHER CONTINUALLY REPEATED HE ASKED ALL HIS SERVANTS ONE BY ONE
I HAVE NOT BROUGHT YOU SO MANY FINE THINGS ONLY TO BE MADE THE SLAVE OF CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT MY OWN POOR JANNUCCIO WHO SAW THAT MATTERS WERE GROWING RATHER TOO WARM IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE LITTLE ONES AND RETURNED TO THE WOOD
THEN JANNUCCIO SAID MY LITTLE CHILDREN STAY HERE IN THIS WOOD AND EAT AND DRINK MERRILY BUT IF YOU WANT ANYTHING FOLLOW THIS LINE OF ASHES WHICH I HAVE BEEN STREWING AS WE CAME ALONG THIS WILL BE A CLUE TO LEAD YOU OUT OF THE LABYRINTH AND BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME
THEN GIVING THEM BOTH A KISS HE RETURNED WEEPING TO HIS HOUSE BUT AT THE HOUR WHEN ALL CREATURES SUMMONED BY THE CONSTABLES OF NIGHT PAY TO NATURE THE TAX OF NEEDFUL REPOSE
THE POOR HUSBAND WHO HAD SOME AFFECTION FOR THIS WOMAN SAID TO HER SOFTLY WIFE DON'T BE ANGRY FOR SUGAR IS DEAR AND TO MORROW MORNING BEFORE THE COCK CROWS I WILL REMOVE THIS ANNOYANCE IN ORDER TO PLEASE YOU
AND THEIR CAPTAIN TOOK HER HOME WITH HIM WHERE HE AND HIS WIFE HAVING JUST LOST A LITTLE GIRL TOOK HER AS THEIR DAUGHTER MEANTIME NENNILLO WHO HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE TREE WAS SURROUNDED BY THE DOGS
ANTONIELLO FLEW INTO A RAGE WITH FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES AND ABUSED HIS SON BUT CIENZO ANSWERED SIR I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD SAY THAT BETTER IS THE LAW COURT THAN THE DOCTOR IN ONE'S HOUSE WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE IF HE HAD BROKEN MY HEAD
THAT HE CUT OFF ALL SEVEN HEADS WHICH FLEW FROM THE NECKS LIKE PEAS FROM THE PAN WHEREUPON HE TOOK OUT THE TONGUES AND PUTTING THEM IN HIS POCKET HE FLUNG THE HEADS A MILE APART FROM THE BODY SO THAT THEY MIGHT NEVER COME TOGETHER AGAIN
BUT CORVETTO WHO WAS ENCHANTED AND PERCEIVED THE TRAPS AND DISCOVERED THE TRICKS WAS AWARE OF ALL THE INTRIGUES AND THE AMBUSCADES THE PLOTS AND CONSPIRACIES OF HIS ENEMIES HE KEPT HIS EARS ALWAYS ON THE ALERT AND HIS EYES OPEN
WITH SO MANY OTHER PRETTY THINGS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE A BETTER MEMORY AND MORE TIME THAN I HAVE TO RELATE THEM WHEN THE COURTIERS CAME TO THE KING WHO WAS THUS TRANSPORTED WITH JOY THEY SAID TO HIM
THE TWO CHILDREN BEGAN TO FEEL AFRAID AT REMAINING IN THAT LONESOME PLACE WHERE THE WATERS OF A RIVER
AND IN FOUR SECONDS WAS ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE OGRE LIVED THEN PASSING UNSEEN INTO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH HE SLEPT HE HID HIMSELF UNDER THE BED AND WAITED AS STILL AS A MOUSE UNTIL NIGHT TO MAKE THE STARS LAUGH
FEEDING ON ACORNS AND CHESTNUTS WHICH THEY FOUND FALLEN ON THE GROUND BUT AS HEAVEN ALWAYS EXTENDS ITS ARM OVER THE INNOCENT THERE CAME BY CHANCE A PRINCE TO HUNT IN THAT WOOD THEN NENNILLO HEARING THE BAYING OF THE HOUNDS WAS SO FRIGHTENED
THEN MENECHELLA ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND MAKING A CURTSEY TO THE KING SHE GAVE HIM THE LETTER TO READ AND WHEN THE KING HAD READ IT HE ORDERED THAT THE DOG SHOULD BE FOLLOWED TO SEE WHERE HE WENT AND THAT HIS MASTER SHOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM
WHOM THE FATHER EMBRACED AND KISSED FOR HALF AN HOUR WITHOUT BEING SATISFIED THEN THE PRINCE MADE HIM PULL OFF HIS JACKET AND HAD HIM DRESSED LIKE A LORD AND SENDING FOR JANNUCCIO'S WIFE HE SHOWED HER THOSE TWO GOLDEN PIPPINS
WHEN THE KING HEARD THIS HE TOOK THE CROWN FROM THE HEAD OF THAT FALSE LOON
THE NEWS OF THIS PROCLAMATION FLEW THROUGH THE WHOLE COUNTRY TILL AT LAST IT CAME TO THE EARS OF CIENZO WHO SAID TO HIMSELF VERILY I AM A GREAT BLOCKHEAD I HAD HOLD OF FORTUNE BY THE FORELOCK AND I LET HER ESCAPE OUT OF MY HAND
WHEN NENNELLA SAW HIM THROUGH THE FISH'S THROAT SHE CRIED ALOUD BROTHER BROTHER YOUR TASK IS DONE THE TABLES ARE LAID OUT EVERY ONE BUT HERE IN THE FISH I MUST SIT AND SIGH O BROTHER WITHOUT YOU I SOON SHALL DIE
THEN THE KING DEMANDED HOW IT WAS THAT HE BOASTED OF HAVING KILLED THE DRAGON SINCE THE HEADS WERE BROUGHT BY THE MAN WHO WAS SITTING CROWNED AT HIS SIDE AND CIENZO ANSWERED THAT FELLOW DESERVES A PASTEBOARD MITRE RATHER THAN A CROWN
COME DOWN HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU WHO I AM THEN CIENZO WITHOUT LOSING COURAGE ANSWERED WAIT AWHILE I'LL COME SO HE GROPED ABOUT UNTIL AT LAST HE FOUND A LADDER WHICH LED TO A CELLAR
THE MOST TERRIBLE MONSTER THAT EVER WAS SEEN WITH THE CREST OF A COCK THE HEAD OF A CAT EYES OF FIRE THE MOUTH OF A BULLDOG THE WINGS OF A BAT THE CLAWS OF A BEAR AND THE TAIL OF A SERPENT NOW THIS DRAGON SWALLOWS A MAIDEN EVERY DAY
BUT BESIDE ALL THOSE OF WHOM YOU MAY HAVE HEARD I WILL NOW TELL YOU OF ANOTHER TO BE ADDED TO THE LIST OF HEARTLESS STEPMOTHERS WHOM YOU WILL CONSIDER WELL DESERVING THE PUNISHMENT SHE PURCHASED FOR HERSELF WITH READY MONEY
THAT ONE COULD NEVER SEE THE SUN THERE THIS OGRE HAD A MOST BEAUTIFUL HORSE WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT WERE FORMED WITH A PENCIL AND AMONGST OTHER WONDERFUL THINGS IT COULD SPEAK LIKE ANY MAN
SO THAT ALL DAY LONG IN EVERY CORNER OF THE PALACE THEY DID NOTHING BUT TATTLE AND WHISPER MURMUR AND GRUMBLE AT THE POOR LAD SAYING WHAT SORCERY HAS THIS FELLOW PRACTISED ON THE KING THAT HE TAKES SUCH A FANCY TO HIM
THEN GOING VERY QUIETLY TO THE OGRE'S STABLE HE SADDLED AND MOUNTED THE HORSE AND FIXING HIS FEET FIRMLY IN THE STIRRUP TOOK HIS WAY BACK BUT AS SOON AS THE HORSE SAW HIMSELF SPURRED OUT OF THE PALACE HE CRIED ALOUD HOLLO
WHERE GIVING THE CHILDREN ANOTHER BASKETFUL OF FOOD HE SAID TO THEM YOU SEE MY DEARS HOW THIS WIFE OF MINE WHO IS COME TO MY HOUSE TO BE YOUR RUIN AND A NAIL IN MY HEART HATES YOU THEREFORE REMAIN IN THIS WOOD WHERE THE TREES MORE COMPASSIONATE
HOW COMES HE BY THIS LUCK THAT NOT A DAY PASSES THAT HE RECEIVES SOME NEW FAVOURS WHILST WE ARE FOR EVER GOING BACKWARD LIKE A ROPE MAKER AND GETTING FROM BAD TO WORSE THOUGH WE SLAVE LIKE DOGS TOIL LIKE FIELD LABOURERS
WHETHER ANY OF THEM HAD LOST A SISTER AND NENNILLO REPLIED THAT HE RECOLLECTED AS A DREAM HAVING HAD A SISTER WHEN THE PRINCE FOUND HIM IN THE WOOD BUT THAT HE HAD NEVER SINCE HEARD ANY TIDINGS OF HER
SINCE HE HAS HAD THE IMPUDENCE TO TELL YOU A BOUNCING LIE BUT TO PROVE TO YOU THAT I HAVE DONE THE DEED AND NOT THIS RASCAL ORDER THE HEADS TO BE PRODUCED NONE OF THEM CAN SPEAK TO THE PROOF WITHOUT A TONGUE AND THESE I HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME AS WITNESSES TO CONVINCE YOU OF THE TRUTH
BE ON YOUR GUARD CORVETTO IS RIDING OFF WITH ME AT THIS ALARM THE OGRE INSTANTLY SET OUT WITH ALL THE ANIMALS THAT SERVED HIM TO CUT CORVETTO IN PIECES FROM THIS SIDE JUMPED AN APE
WAS BUSYING HERSELF WITH PREPARING THE FEAST THEN CORVETTO ENTERING WITH A LOOK OF COMPASSION SAID GOOD DAY MY GOOD WOMAN
AS CORVETTO HAS DONE SO MUCH TO SERVE YOU IT WOULD BE NO GREAT MATTER FOR HIM IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU A SIGNAL PLEASURE TO GET THE OGRE'S PALACE WHICH IS FIT FOR AN EMPEROR TO LIVE IN FOR IT HAS SO MANY ROOMS AND CHAMBERS INSIDE AND OUT
AND NOW THE LOT HAS FALLEN ON MENECHELLA THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING SO THERE IS GREAT WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE ROYAL PALACE SINCE THE FAIREST CREATURE IN ALL THE LAND IS DOOMED TO BE DEVOURED BY THIS HORRID BEAST
THEN BEGGING HIS FATHER'S BLESSING CIENZO MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND TUCKING THE ENCHANTED DOG UNDER HIS ARM HE WENT HIS WAY OUT OF THE CITY MAKING A WINTER OF TEARS WITH A SUMMER OF SIGHS
AND TAKE THIS TO THE KING'S DAUGHTER GIVE IT TO NO ONE ELSE BUT PLACE IT IN THE HAND OF THAT SILVER FACED MAIDEN HERSELF AWAY RAN THE DOG TO THE PALACE AS IF HE WERE FLYING AND GOING UP THE STAIRS HE FOUND THE KING
SO TWO OF THE COURTIERS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THE DOG UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE TAVERN WHERE THEY FOUND CIENZO AND DELIVERING THE MESSAGE FROM THE KING THEY CONDUCTED HIM TO THE PALACE INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE KING
MALIGNITY AND ILL OFFICES ARE MEASURED OUT IN BUSHELS DECEIT AND TREACHERY ARE WEIGHED BY THE TON BUT WHO CAN COUNT ALL THE ATTEMPTS THESE COURTIERS MADE TO BRING HIM TO GRIEF
BUT IF ANY ONE WERE TO ASK ME WHERE FRAUD AND HYPOCRISY MIGHT TRULY BE FOUND I SHOULD KNOW OF NO OTHER PLACE TO NAME THAN THE COURT WHERE DETRACTION ALWAYS WEARS THE MASK OF AMUSEMENT WHERE AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE CUT AND SEW UP WOUND AND HEAL
WILL GIVE YOU SHELTER FROM THE SUN WHERE THE RIVER MORE CHARITABLE WILL GIVE YOU DRINK WITHOUT POISON AND THE EARTH MORE KIND WILL GIVE YOU A PILLOW OF GRASS WITHOUT DANGER AND WHEN YOU WANT FOOD FOLLOW THIS LITTLE PATH OF BRAN WHICH I HAVE MADE FOR YOU IN A STRAIGHT LINE
I AM SO GLAD WE ARE GOT ACQUAINTED AT LAST CONTINUED CHARLOTTE AND NOW I HOPE WE SHALL ALWAYS BE GREAT FRIENDS YOU CAN'T THINK HOW MUCH I LONGED TO SEE YOU IT IS SO DELIGHTFUL THAT YOU SHOULD LIVE AT THE COTTAGE NOTHING CAN BE LIKE IT TO BE SURE
IF WE CAN PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO ALL THIS SAID LADY RUSSELL LOOKING OVER HER PAPER MUCH MAY BE DONE IF HE WILL ADOPT THESE REGULATIONS IN SEVEN YEARS HE WILL BE CLEAR AND I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM AND ELIZABETH
FOR AT HER PARTICULAR DESIRE LADY MIDDLETON SET HER DOWN IN BERKELEY STREET ON THE CHANCE OF SEEING ELINOR ALONE TO TELL HER HOW HAPPY SHE WAS THE CHANCE PROVED A LUCKY ONE
HE SAID IN CONFESSING HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT SIR WALTER COULD MATERIALLY ALTER HIS STYLE OF LIVING
WITH ALMOST EVERY OTHER MAN IN THE WORLD IT WOULD BE AN ALARMING PROSPECT BUT EDWARD'S AFFECTION AND CONSTANCY NOTHING CAN DEPRIVE ME OF I KNOW THAT CONVICTION MUST BE EVERY THING TO YOU AND HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORTED BY THE SAME TRUST IN YOUR'S
AND THANK HEAVEN YOU ARE WHAT YOU ALWAYS WERE SHE PAUSED NO ONE SPOKE
HOW FEW PEOPLE KNOW WHAT COMFORT IS SIR JOHN IS AS STUPID AS THE WEATHER THE REST OF THE COMPANY SOON DROPT IN I AM AFRAID MISS MARIANNE SAID SIR JOHN
EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUSTICE AND EQUITY
I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE IT OF ALL THINGS THE WESTONS WILL BE WITH US AND IT WILL BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL YOU CANNOT THINK WHAT A SWEET PLACE CLEVELAND IS AND WE ARE SO GAY NOW FOR MISTER PALMER IS ALWAYS GOING ABOUT THE COUNTRY CANVASSING AGAINST THE ELECTION
I HAVE THE WHIP HAND OF YOU CHARLOTTE LAUGHED HEARTILY TO THINK THAT HER HUSBAND COULD NOT GET RID OF HER AND EXULTINGLY SAID SHE DID NOT CARE HOW CROSS HE WAS TO HER AS THEY MUST LIVE TOGETHER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE
ELINOR WAS PREVENTED FROM MAKING ANY REPLY TO THIS CIVIL TRIUMPH BY THE DOOR'S BEING THROWN OPEN THE SERVANT'S ANNOUNCING MISTER FERRARS AND EDWARD'S IMMEDIATELY WALKING IN
THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE IN ITS UNPLEASANTEST FORM WHICH THEY WOULD EACH HAVE BEEN MOST ANXIOUS TO AVOID HAD FALLEN ON THEM THEY WERE NOT ONLY ALL THREE TOGETHER BUT WERE TOGETHER WITHOUT THE RELIEF OF ANY OTHER PERSON
KELLYNCH HALL AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE OF DOUBT AND INDECISION THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT THERE HAD BEEN THREE ALTERNATIVES LONDON BATH
THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE GLAD TO SEE ME THEY ARE SUCH CHARMING WOMEN
WE SEEM SO BESET WITH DIFFICULTIES ON EVERY SIDE THAT THOUGH IT WOULD MAKE US MISERABLE FOR A TIME WE SHOULD BE HAPPIER PERHAPS IN THE END
HE IS THE MOST FEARFUL OF GIVING PAIN OF WOUNDING EXPECTATION AND THE MOST INCAPABLE OF BEING SELFISH OF ANY BODY I EVER SAW EDWARD IT IS SO AND I WILL SAY IT
ALWAYS OUT OF HUMOUR ELINOR WAS NOT INCLINED AFTER A LITTLE OBSERVATION TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR BEING SO GENUINELY AND UNAFFECTEDLY ILL NATURED OR ILL BRED AS HE WISHED TO APPEAR HIS TEMPER MIGHT
BUT IF HE WERE EVER SO MUCH THERE
ELIZABETH HAD BEEN LATELY FORMING AN INTIMACY WHICH SHE WISHED TO SEE INTERRUPTED IT WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER SHEPHERD WHO HAD RETURNED AFTER AN UNPROSPEROUS MARRIAGE TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE WITH THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF TWO CHILDREN
BUT ELINOR HAD MORE TO DO
SAID MISTER PALMER MARIANNE REMAINED PERFECTLY SILENT THOUGH HER COUNTENANCE BETRAYED HER INTEREST IN WHAT WAS SAID IS IT VERY UGLY
THE MOTIVE WAS TOO COMMON TO BE WONDERED AT
FOR SHE LOITERED AWAY SEVERAL MINUTES ON THE LANDING PLACE WITH THE MOST HIGH MINDED FORTITUDE BEFORE SHE WENT TO HER SISTER WHEN THAT WAS ONCE DONE HOWEVER IT WAS TIME FOR THE RAPTURES OF EDWARD TO CEASE FOR MARIANNE'S JOY HURRIED HER INTO THE DRAWING ROOM IMMEDIATELY
OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY
HER LOVE MADE NO ANSWER AND AFTER SLIGHTLY BOWING TO THE LADIES BEGAN COMPLAINING OF THE WEATHER HOW HORRID ALL THIS IS SAID HE SUCH WEATHER MAKES EVERY THING AND EVERY BODY DISGUSTING
TIS BECAUSE YOU ARE AN INDIFFERENT PERSON SAID LUCY WITH SOME PIQUE AND LAYING A PARTICULAR STRESS ON THOSE WORDS THAT YOUR JUDGMENT MIGHT JUSTLY HAVE SUCH WEIGHT WITH ME
IF YOU COULD BE SUPPOSED TO BE BIASED IN ANY RESPECT BY YOUR OWN FEELINGS YOUR OPINION WOULD NOT BE WORTH HAVING ELINOR THOUGHT IT WISEST TO MAKE NO ANSWER TO THIS
IT WAS TREATED BY THE FORMER WITH CALMNESS AND CAUTION AND DISMISSED AS SOON AS CIVILITY WOULD ALLOW FOR SHE FELT SUCH CONVERSATIONS TO BE AN INDULGENCE WHICH LUCY DID NOT DESERVE AND WHICH WERE DANGEROUS TO HERSELF
TO BE MORE THOROUGHLY GOOD NATURED OR MORE DETERMINED TO BE HAPPY THAN MISSUS PALMER THE STUDIED INDIFFERENCE INSOLENCE AND DISCONTENT OF HER HUSBAND GAVE HER NO PAIN AND WHEN HE SCOLDED OR ABUSED HER SHE WAS HIGHLY DIVERTED
SHE HAD FOUND IN HER EVERY THING THAT COULD TEND TO MAKE A FARTHER CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FAMILIES UNDESIRABLE
AND COULD STRUGGLE WITH ANY POVERTY FOR HIM BUT I LOVE HIM TOO WELL TO BE THE SELFISH MEANS OF ROBBING HIM PERHAPS OF ALL THAT HIS MOTHER MIGHT GIVE HIM IF HE MARRIED TO PLEASE HER WE MUST WAIT IT MAY BE FOR MANY YEARS
BUT THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN THE CHANCE OF BEING TOLERABLY HAPPY IN MARRIAGE WHICH SINCERE AFFECTION ON HER SIDE WOULD HAVE GIVEN FOR SELF INTEREST ALONE COULD INDUCE A WOMAN TO KEEP A MAN TO AN ENGAGEMENT OF WHICH SHE SEEMED SO THOROUGHLY AWARE THAT HE WAS WEARY
I FELT SURE THAT YOU WAS ANGRY WITH ME AND HAVE BEEN QUARRELLING WITH MYSELF EVER SINCE FOR HAVING TOOK SUCH A LIBERTY AS TO TROUBLE YOU WITH MY AFFAIRS BUT I AM VERY GLAD TO FIND IT WAS ONLY MY OWN FANCY AND THAT YOU REALLY DO NOT BLAME ME
AND IT IS SINGULARITY WHICH OFTEN MAKES THE WORST PART OF OUR SUFFERING AS IT ALWAYS DOES OF OUR CONDUCT I HAVE GREAT HOPE OF PREVAILING WE MUST BE SERIOUS AND DECIDED FOR AFTER ALL THE PERSON WHO HAS CONTRACTED DEBTS MUST PAY THEM
FROM THIS TIME THE SUBJECT WAS NEVER REVIVED BY ELINOR AND WHEN ENTERED ON BY LUCY WHO SELDOM MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY OF INTRODUCING IT AND WAS PARTICULARLY CAREFUL TO INFORM HER CONFIDANTE OF HER HAPPINESS WHENEVER SHE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM EDWARD
TO LIVE NO LONGER WITH THE DECENCIES EVEN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN NO HE WOULD SOONER QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AT ONCE THAN REMAIN IN IT ON SUCH DISGRACEFUL TERMS QUIT KELLYNCH HALL THE HINT WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN UP BY MISTER SHEPHERD
LUCY HERE LOOKED UP BUT ELINOR WAS CAREFUL IN GUARDING HER COUNTENANCE FROM EVERY EXPRESSION THAT COULD GIVE HER WORDS A SUSPICIOUS TENDENCY EDWARD'S LOVE FOR ME SAID LUCY HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL PUT TO THE TEST BY OUR LONG
A GREAT WHILE EVER SINCE MY SISTER MARRIED HE WAS A PARTICULAR FRIEND OF SIR JOHN'S I BELIEVE SHE ADDED IN A LOW VOICE
WHICH IS A MELANCHOLY AND SHOCKING EXTREMITY IS HER SON DETERMINED TO SUBMIT TO THIS AND TO ALL THE TEDIOUSNESS OF THE MANY YEARS OF SUSPENSE IN WHICH IT MAY INVOLVE YOU RATHER THAN RUN THE RISK OF HER DISPLEASURE FOR A WHILE BY OWNING THE TRUTH
AND HER LIKING ME IS EVERY THING YOU SHAN'T TALK ME OUT OF MY SATISFACTION
TO THIS ELINOR HAD NO ANSWER TO MAKE AND DID NOT ATTEMPT ANY ARE YOU ILL MISS DASHWOOD YOU SEEM LOW YOU DON'T SPEAK SURE YOU AN'T WELL I NEVER WAS IN BETTER HEALTH
AND FROM OUR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS IN LIFE FROM HIS BEING SO MUCH MORE IN THE WORLD THAN ME AND OUR CONTINUAL SEPARATION
LEST THEY MIGHT PROVOKE EACH OTHER TO AN UNSUITABLE INCREASE OF EASE AND UNRESERVE AND WAS EVEN PARTLY DETERMINED NEVER TO MENTION THE SUBJECT AGAIN ANOTHER PAUSE THEREFORE OF MANY MINUTES DURATION SUCCEEDED THIS SPEECH
YOUR CASE IS A VERY UNFORTUNATE ONE YOU SEEM TO ME TO BE SURROUNDED WITH DIFFICULTIES AND YOU WILL HAVE NEED OF ALL YOUR MUTUAL AFFECTION TO SUPPORT YOU UNDER THEM MISTER FERRARS I BELIEVE IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON HIS MOTHER
WHOSE EAR HAD CAUGHT THOSE WORDS BY A SUDDEN PAUSE IN MARIANNE'S MUSIC
ELINOR HARDLY KNEW WHETHER TO SMILE OR SIGH AT THIS ASSERTION LUCY WENT ON
I ASSURE YOU I HEARD OF IT IN MY WAY THROUGH TOWN MY DEAR MISSUS PALMER UPON MY HONOUR I DID I MET COLONEL BRANDON MONDAY MORNING IN BOND STREET JUST BEFORE WE LEFT TOWN AND HE TOLD ME OF IT DIRECTLY YOU SURPRISE ME VERY MUCH
BUT THE OBJECT OF DISTANT CIVILITY FROM SITUATION MISSUS CLAY WAS IN LADY RUSSELL'S ESTIMATE
SHE WAS A BENEVOLENT CHARITABLE GOOD WOMAN AND CAPABLE OF STRONG ATTACHMENTS MOST CORRECT IN HER CONDUCT STRICT IN HER NOTIONS OF DECORUM AND WITH MANNERS THAT WERE HELD A STANDARD OF GOOD BREEDING
AND REPLIED THIS COMPLIMENT WOULD EFFECTUALLY FRIGHTEN ME FROM GIVING ANY OPINION ON THE SUBJECT HAD I FORMED ONE IT RAISES MY INFLUENCE MUCH TOO HIGH THE POWER OF DIVIDING TWO PEOPLE SO TENDERLY ATTACHED IS TOO MUCH FOR AN INDIFFERENT PERSON
WOULD BE HARDLY LESS PAINFUL THAN OF BOTH AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST OF LADY RUSSELL'S TOO GENTLE REDUCTIONS HOW ANNE'S MORE RIGID REQUISITIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE LADY RUSSELL'S HAD NO SUCCESS AT ALL
YOU AND I SIR JOHN SAID MISSUS JENNINGS SHOULD NOT STAND UPON SUCH CEREMONY THEN YOU WOULD BE VERY ILL BRED CRIED MISTER PALMER
AND ANCIENT DIGNITY TO SUPPORT IN ANY OTHER PLACE SIR WALTER MIGHT JUDGE FOR HIMSELF AND WOULD BE LOOKED UP TO AS REGULATING THE MODES OF LIFE IN WHATEVER WAY HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT
OR TO ALLOW HER TO DERIVE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM A PREFERENCE ONLY GIVEN HER BECAUSE HER REAL SITUATION WAS UNKNOWN BUT THAT IT WAS SO HAD NOT ONLY BEEN DECLARED BY LUCY'S EYES AT THE TIME BUT WAS DECLARED OVER AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING MORE OPENLY
BUT EVEN THIS ENCOURAGEMENT FAILED FOR HE WOULD GO AND LUCY WHO WOULD HAVE OUTSTAID HIM HAD HIS VISIT LASTED TWO HOURS SOON AFTERWARDS WENT AWAY WHAT CAN BRING HER HERE SO OFTEN SAID MARIANNE ON HER LEAVING THEM
WHILE HER EYES BRIGHTENED AT THE INFORMATION IT WOULD HAVE GAVE ME SUCH PLEASURE TO MEET YOU THERE BUT I DARE SAY YOU WILL GO FOR ALL THAT TO BE SURE YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER WILL ASK YOU TO COME TO THEM
AND OF HER BEING PARTICULARLY DISGUSTED WITH HIS MOTHER TILL THEY WERE MORE IN PRIVATE BUT WHY WERE YOU NOT THERE EDWARD WHY DID YOU NOT COME I WAS ENGAGED ELSEWHERE
IT IS BUT NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER AS WELL AS OURSELVES MARIANNE LOOKED AT HER STEADILY AND SAID
AND I AM SO GLAD YOUR SISTER IS GOING TO BE WELL MARRIED I HOPE YOU WILL BE A GREAT DEAL AT COMBE MAGNA IT IS A SWEET PLACE BY ALL ACCOUNTS YOU HAVE BEEN LONG ACQUAINTED WITH COLONEL BRANDON HAVE NOT YOU YES
AGAIN THEY ALL SAT DOWN AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO ALL WERE SILENT WHILE MARIANNE WAS LOOKING WITH THE MOST SPEAKING TENDERNESS SOMETIMES AT EDWARD AND SOMETIMES AT ELINOR REGRETTING ONLY THAT THEIR DELIGHT IN EACH OTHER SHOULD BE CHECKED BY LUCY'S UNWELCOME PRESENCE
AND UNDER MANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT NATURALLY WOULD DURING A FOUR YEARS ENGAGEMENT
AND LUCY WAS STILL THE FIRST TO END IT SHALL YOU BE IN TOWN THIS WINTER MISS DASHWOOD SAID SHE WITH ALL HER ACCUSTOMARY COMPLACENCY CERTAINLY NOT I AM SORRY FOR THAT RETURNED THE OTHER
PERHAPS BE A LITTLE SOURED BY FINDING LIKE MANY OTHERS OF HIS SEX THAT THROUGH SOME UNACCOUNTABLE BIAS IN FAVOUR OF BEAUTY HE WAS THE HUSBAND OF A VERY SILLY WOMAN BUT SHE KNEW THAT THIS KIND OF BLUNDER WAS TOO COMMON FOR ANY SENSIBLE MAN TO BE LASTINGLY HURT BY IT
WEAPONS AND EACH WITH MUSING SOUL RETIRE TO CELEBRATE OUR DEAR COMMANDER'S DEATH NO MORE FOR HIM LIFE'S STORMY CONFLICTS NOR VICTORY NOR DEFEAT NO MORE TIME'S DARK EVENTS CHARGING LIKE CEASELESS CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY BUT SING POET IN OUR NAME
I THANK YOU KINDLY LITTLE DOG I FARE AS WELL AS YOU OLD RHYME ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A PUSSY CAT CALLED RIBBY WHO INVITED A LITTLE DOG CALLED DUCHESS TO TEA COME IN GOOD TIME MY DEAR DUCHESS SAID RIBBY'S LETTER

AND JUST AT THE SAME TIME DUCHESS CAME OUT OF HER HOUSE AT THE OTHER END OF THE VILLAGE RIBBY MET DUCHESS HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET ALSO CARRYING A BASKET COVERED WITH A CLOTH THEY ONLY BOWED TO ONE ANOTHER THEY DID NOT SPEAK BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A PARTY
SHE POPPED HER PIE INTO THE OVEN THERE WERE TWO OVENS ONE ABOVE THE OTHER SOME OTHER KNOBS AND HANDLES WERE ONLY ORNAMENTAL AND NOT INTENDED TO OPEN

IT DID NOT TAKE ME MANY DAYS TO DISCOVER THAT HENRIETTE WAS A WORTHY SUCCESSOR TO HER LATE HUSBAND FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONAL PROFIT ESCAPED HER EYE AND I WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE AS TIME WENT ON AND I NOTED THE ACCUMULATION OF SPOONS FORKS NUTCRACKERS
THIS WON'T DO HENRIETTE NERVES WILL PROVE YOUR RUIN AND IF YOU CAN'T STAND YOUR LOSSES AT BRIDGE WHAT WILL YOU DO IN THE FACE OF THE GREATER CRISIS WHICH IN OUR PROFESSION IS LIKELY TO CONFRONT US IN THE SHAPE OF AN UNEXPECTED VISIT OF POLICE AT ANY MOMENT HER ANSWER WAS A RINGING LAUGH
SUPPOSE HE HAD RECOGNIZED YOU CRIED HENRIETTE OH HE DID OR AT LEAST HE THOUGHT HE DID I REPLIED SMILING BROADLY AT THE RECOLLECTION
YOU KNOW MISSUS GUSHINGTON ANDREWS YES SAID I SHE IS THE LADY WHO ASKED ME FOR THE OLIVES AT YOUR LAST DINNER PRECISELY OBSERVED HENRIETTE YOU POSSIBLY OBSERVED ALSO THAT WHEREVER SHE GOES SHE WEARS ABOUT SIXTY NINE YARDS OF PEARL ROPE UPON HER PERSON
TRINITY SURE TO ME YOU BRING LILAC BLOOMING PERENNIAL AND DROOPING STAR IN THE WEST AND THOUGHT OF HIM I LOVE TWO O POWERFUL WESTERN FALLEN STAR O SHADES OF NIGHT O MOODY TEARFUL NIGHT
AND STILL RETAIN THE PREJUDICE AGAINST INFERIOR ASSOCIATIONS WHICH AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN WHATEVER THE VICISSITUDES OF HIS CAREER CAN NEVER QUITE RID HIMSELF OF I HAD TO JOIN THEIR CLUB AN EXCLUSIVE ORGANIZATION OF BUTLERS AND GENTLEMEN'S GENTLEMEN OTHERWISE VALETS
EVEN THEN WE'LL BE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE GOOD AND BY THE WAY BUNNY I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON ONE THING AH WHAT'S THAT MY SANG FROID MY NERVE I ASKED AIRILY
RIBBY WENT ON TO TIMOTHY BAKER'S AND BOUGHT THE MUFFINS THEN SHE WENT HOME THERE SEEMED TO BE A SORT OF SCUFFLING NOISE IN THE BACK PASSAGE AS SHE WAS COMING IN AT THE FRONT DOOR BUT THERE WAS NOBODY THERE
BUT I THINK IT IS PRETTY GOOD I MANAGED TO RAISE TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ON MY OWN ACCOUNT BY THE USE OF IT LAST NIGHT INDEED SAID HENRIETTE WITH A SLIGHT FROWN HOW BUNNY YOU KNOW YOU ARE LIKELY TO COMPLICATE MATTERS FOR ALL OF US IF YOU WORK ON THE SIDE WHAT PRAY DID YOU DO LAST NIGHT
NOTHING OF THE SORT BUNNY JUST DO AS I TELL YOU
HERE COFFIN THAT SLOWLY PASSES I GIVE YOU MY SPRIG OF LILAC SEVEN NOR FOR YOU FOR ONE ALONE BLOSSOMS AND BRANCHES GREEN TO COFFINS ALL I BRING
AND IN ORDER TO QUIET ALL SUSPICION OF MY REAL STATUS IN THE VAN RAFFLES HOUSEHOLD I WAS COMPELLED TO ACT THE PART IN A FASHION WHICH REVOLTED ME OTHERWISE THE POSITION WAS PLEASANT AND
AS COULD BE FOUND IN THE SOCIAL CAPITAL OF THE UNITED STATES AS FOR ME I WAS THE PICTURE OF GLOOM
SITTING BEFORE THE FIRE SIGHING AND GROANING AND FEELING VERY UNHAPPY HOW COULD I HAVE SWALLOWED IT SUCH A LARGE THING AS A PATTY PAN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND STARED MOURNFULLY AT THE GRATE
AND THEN BACK TO ENGLAND FOR FIAMETTA
COMRADES MINE AND I IN THE MIDST AND THEIR MEMORY EVER TO KEEP FOR THE DEAD I LOVED SO WELL FOR THE SWEETEST WISEST SOUL OF ALL MY DAYS AND LANDS AND THIS FOR HIS DEAR SAKE LILAC AND STAR AND BIRD TWINED WITH THE CHANT OF MY SOUL
RESULT NEXT TUESDAY FIAMETTA DE BELLEVILLE COMES TO ME AS MY MAID
WITH PURE DELIBERATE NOTES SPREADING FILLING THE NIGHT LOUD IN THE PINES AND CEDARS DIM
BETTER CALL IT THE INCIDENT I PUT IN
THE SONG THE WONDROUS CHANT OF THE GRAY BROWN BIRD
EIGHT O WESTERN ORB SAILING THE HEAVEN
I DID NOT REMEMBER THAT I HAD MINCED IT UP SO FINE I SUPPOSE THIS IS A QUICKER OVEN THAN MY OWN THE PIE DISH WAS EMPTYING RAPIDLY DUCHESS HAD HAD FOUR HELPS ALREADY AND WAS FUMBLING WITH THE SPOON
OVER THE DENSE PACK'D CITIES ALL AND THE TEEMING WHARVES AND WAYS I FLOAT THIS CAROL WITH JOY WITH JOY TO THEE O DEATH FIFTEEN TO THE TALLY OF MY SOUL LOUD AND STRONG KEPT UP THE GRAY BROWN BIRD
MY CAPTAIN DOES NOT ANSWER HIS LIPS ARE PALE AND STILL MY FATHER DOES NOT FEEL MY ARM HE HAS NO PULSE NOR WILL THE SHIP IS ANCHOR'D SAFE AND SOUND ITS VOYAGE CLOSED AND DONE
OF THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF MISSUS GASTER'S JEWELS
BUT THERE THERE BUNNY I'LL MANAGE THIS LITTLE THING MYSELF IT'S A TRIFLE TOO SUBTLE FOR A MAN'S INTELLECT ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT MAN IS YOU
FROM ME TO THEE GLAD SERENADES
FROM MY GAZE ON THEE IN THE WEST FRONTING THE WEST COMMUNING WITH THEE
SONG OF THE BLEEDING THROAT DEATH'S OUTLET SONG OF LIFE FOR WELL DEAR BROTHER I KNOW
AND THEN I UNFOLDED TO HER THE INCIDENTS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN BY ASSUMING AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE THE POSITION OF VALET
AND IT HAS AFFECTED HER USUAL CALMNESS I MUST DO SOMETHING TO WARN HER AGAINST THIS MOMENTARY WEAKNESS
HUMPH I SAID GLOOMILY THAT CUTS US OUT DOESN'T IT DOES IT
VICTORIOUS SONG DEATH'S OUTLET SONG YET VARYING EVER ALTERING SONG AS LOW AND WAILING YET CLEAR THE NOTES RISING AND FALLING FLOODING THE NIGHT SADLY SINKING AND FAINTING AS
IN THE SWAMP IN SECLUDED RECESSES A SHY AND HIDDEN BIRD IS WARBLING A SONG SOLITARY THE THRUSH THE HERMIT WITHDRAWN TO HIMSELF AVOIDING THE SETTLEMENTS SINGS BY HIMSELF A SONG
YES SAID I WHAT OF IT I WANT YOU DURING HER ABSENCE TO GO WITH ME TO HER ROOM THE SITUATION BEGAN TO DAWN ON ME YES I CRIED BREATHLESSLY AND SEARCH HER TRUNKS NO BUNNY NO THE EAVES WHISPERED HENRIETTE
I TOOK HIM TO HIS APARTMENT DISMISSED THE CAB AND LETTING OURSELVES INTO HIS ROOM WITH HIS OWN LATCH KEY PUT HIM TO BED HIS CLOTHES I TOOK AS A WELL ORDERED VALET SHOULD FROM HIS BED CHAMBER INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHERE AFTER REMOVING THE CONTENTS OF HIS POCKETS
I AM TRULY GLAD TO HEAR IT HE HAS BROUGHT YOU A PILL MY DEAR DUCHESS I THINK I SHOULD FEEL QUITE WELL IF HE ONLY FELT MY PULSE SAID DUCHESS BACKING AWAY FROM THE MAGPIE WHO SIDLED UP WITH SOMETHING IN HIS BEAK IT IS ONLY A BREAD PILL YOU HAD MUCH BETTER TAKE IT
NO DETECTIVES I HOPE I REPLIED PALING AT THE THOUGHT NO SIR SHE LAUGHED MISSUS GASTER'S MAID WE MUST GET HER BUNNY
REMEMBER BUNNY CALM DELIBERATION YOUR GLOVES NOW WERE HER LAST WORDS TO ME
AND THEN SHE THOUGHT THAT DID NOT LOOK QUITE POLITE
I FOLLOWED OUT HENRIETTE'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND AN HOUR LATER RETURNED WITH THE INFORMATION THAT FIAMETTA WAS INDEED SAFELY ON HER WAY GOOD SAID MISSUS RAFFLES AND NOW BUNNY FOR THE GASTER JEWELS MOUNTING THE STAIRS RAPIDLY TAKING CARE OF COURSE
HUSH JUST WATCH ME SHE REPLIED WHEREUPON THIS WONDERFUL CREATURE TAKING MY WHITE GLOVES DELIBERATELY SMEARED THEIR PALMS AND INNER SIDES OF THE FINGERS
WHERE ON THE DECK MY CAPTAIN LIES FALLEN COLD AND DEAD O CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN RISE UP AND HEAR THE BELLS RISE UP FOR YOU THE FLAG IS FLUNG FOR YOU THE BUGLE TRILLS
AND THE FIELDS ALL BUSY WITH LABOR AND THE INFINITE SEPARATE HOUSES HOW THEY ALL WENT ON EACH WITH ITS MEALS AND MINUTIA OF DAILY USAGES AND THE STREETS HOW THEIR THROBBINGS THROBB'D AND THE CITIES PENT
AND WHAT SHALL THE PICTURES BE THAT I HANG ON THE WALLS TO ADORN THE BURIAL HOUSE OF HIM I LOVE PICTURES OF GROWING SPRING AND FARMS AND HOMES WITH THE FOURTH MONTH EVE AT SUNDOWN AND THE GRAY SMOKE LUCID AND BRIGHT
SING AS THEY CLOSE THE DOORS OF EARTH UPON HIM ONE VERSE FOR THE HEAVY HEARTS OF SOLDIERS THIS DUST WAS ONCE THE MAN
SHE SAT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE TO WAIT FOR THE LITTLE DOG
BUT I SAW THEY WERE NOT AS WAS THOUGHT THEY THEMSELVES WERE FULLY AT REST THEY SUFFER'D NOT
FOR FRESH AS THE MORNING THUS WOULD I CHANT A SONG FOR YOU O SANE AND SACRED DEATH ALL OVER BOUQUETS OF ROSES O DEATH I COVER YOU OVER WITH ROSES AND EARLY LILIES
WHEN I GOT THE CLOAK BACK BOTH WERE GONE OH SHE'S FIAMETTA DE BELLEVILLE ALL RIGHT AND WE MUST GET HER WHAT FOR TO ROB YOU
HENRIETTE WAS CHARMING IN HER NEW GOWN SPECIALLY IMPORTED FROM PARIS A GOWN OF ORIENTAL DESIGN WITH ROW UPON ROW OF BRILLIANTLY SHINING CRESCENT SHAPED ORNAMENTS FIRMLY AFFIXED TO THE FRONT OF IT AND EVERY ONE OF THEM AS SHARP AS A STEEL KNIFE I COULD SEE AT A GLANCE
PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE WISE MY DEAR DUCHESS RIBBY AND DUCHESS SAID GOOD BYE AFFECTIONATELY AND DUCHESS STARTED HOME HALF WAY UP THE LANE SHE STOPPED AND LOOKED BACK RIBBY HAD GONE IN AND SHUT HER DOOR
AS I SAW YOU HAD SOMETHING TO TELL AS YOU BENT TO ME NIGHT AFTER NIGHT

IT'S THE SEA AIR BUT I NEVER SEE YOUR MASTER ON DECK NEVER
CHAPTER NINE IN WHICH THE RED SEA AND THE INDIAN OCEAN PROVE PROPITIOUS TO THE
AND SO HER DEPARTURE WAS POSTPONED TILL TO MORROW THANK YOU RETURNED MISTER FOGG DESCENDING MATHEMATICALLY
OR NEAR FRIENDS WHICH IS CERTAINLY MORE UNUSUAL HE LIVED ALONE IN HIS HOUSE
A JETTY PIER SOME TWO THOUSAND YARDS ALONG EXTENDED INTO THE ROADSTEAD A NUMBER OF FISHING SMACKS AND COASTING BOATS
AND ON THE FINEST LINEN CLUB DECANTERS OF A LOST MOULD CONTAINED HIS SHERRY HIS PORT AND HIS CINNAMON SPICED CLARET WHILE HIS BEVERAGES WERE
BUT HE WAS A BEARDED TRANQUIL BYRON WHO MIGHT LIVE ON A THOUSAND YEARS WITHOUT GROWING OLD CERTAINLY AN ENGLISHMAN IT WAS MORE DOUBTFUL WHETHER PHILEAS FOGG WAS A LONDONER
IMPORTUNATE CROWD OF PORTERS CAME UP TO HIM AND POLITELY ASKED IF HE COULD POINT OUT THE ENGLISH CONSULATE AT THE SAME TIME SHOWING A PASSPORT
WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE NO INTENTION OF RISING
THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THIS TELEGRAPHIC DISPATCH ABOUT PHILEAS FOGG WAS SENT WERE AS FOLLOWS
AND IF MISTER FOGG WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS LATE ON REACHING YOKOHAMA THIS TIME WOULD NO DOUBT
NOT SUMPTUOUS WAS EXCEEDINGLY COMFORTABLE
FAITH MONSIEUR FIX I ASSURE YOU I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT NOR WOULD I GIVE HALF A CROWN TO FIND OUT
THE LATTER BEING EITHER ATTACHED TO THE REGULAR BRITISH FORCES OR
NERVOUSLY PACING UP AND DOWN AND UNABLE TO STAND STILL FOR A MOMENT THIS WAS FIX ONE OF THE DETECTIVES WHO HAD BEEN DISPATCHED FROM ENGLAND IN SEARCH OF THE BANK ROBBER IT WAS HIS TASK TO NARROWLY WATCH EVERY PASSENGER

THE PILOT WENT ON BOARD AT SIX AND TOOK HIS PLACE ON THE BRIDGE TO GUIDE THE RANGOON THROUGH THE CHANNELS TO THE PORT OF HONG KONG
RIGGING PROVED TOO MUCH
MISTER FOGG BOLDER THAN HIS SERVANT DID NOT HESITATE TO APPROACH THE PILOT AND TRANQUILLY ASK HIM IF HE KNEW WHEN A STEAMER WOULD LEAVE HONG KONG FOR YOKOHAMA AT HIGH TIDE TO MORROW MORNING ANSWERED THE PILOT
ITS BUTTERY AND DAIRY AIDED TO CROWD HIS TABLE WITH THEIR MOST SUCCULENT STORES HE WAS SERVED BY THE GRAVEST WAITERS IN DRESS COATS AND SHOES WITH SWAN SKIN SOLES
SO AS TO ESTABLISH HIS IDENTITY
NEVER FAILED TO ACCEPT WITH GRACEFUL ALACRITY MENTALLY PRONOUNCING FIX THE BEST OF GOOD FELLOWS MEANWHILE THE MONGOLIA WAS PUSHING FORWARD RAPIDLY ON THE THIRTEENTH
WITH AN AUTOMATIC MOTION AND WENT OFF WITHOUT A WORD
GREAT ROBBERS ALWAYS RESEMBLE HONEST FOLKS FELLOWS WHO HAVE RASCALLY FACES HAVE ONLY ONE COURSE TO TAKE AND THAT IS TO REMAIN HONEST OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE ARRESTED OFF HAND
HE MADE HIS FOUR HEARTY MEALS EVERY DAY REGARDLESS OF THE MOST PERSISTENT ROLLING AND PITCHING ON THE PART OF THE STEAMER
AT SIGHT FROM HIS ACCOUNT CURRENT WHICH WAS ALWAYS FLUSH WAS PHILEAS FOGG RICH UNDOUBTEDLY BUT THOSE WHO KNEW HIM BEST COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE AND MISTER FOGG

HIS ANXIETY TO FIX WHO THE SLY RASCAL TRIED TO CONSOLE HIM BY SAYING THAT MISTER FOGG
EITHER IN SLEEPING OR MAKING HIS TOILET WHEN HE CHOSE TO TAKE A WALK IT WAS WITH A REGULAR STEP IN THE ENTRANCE HALL WITH ITS MOSAIC FLOORING OR IN THE CIRCULAR GALLERY
TO HAVE THE PASSPORT AGAIN VISAED FIX UNOBSERVED FOLLOWED THEM THE VISA PROCURED MISTER FOGG RETURNED ON BOARD TO RESUME HIS FORMER HABITS
JUST SO MONSIEUR FIX

BY AT LEAST A HALF THE OTHER WAS A SMALL SLIGHT BUILT PERSONAGE WITH A NERVOUS INTELLIGENT FACE AND BRIGHT EYES PEERING OUT FROM UNDER EYEBROWS WHICH
BURLINGTON GARDENS THE HOUSE IN WHICH SHERIDAN DIED IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST NOTICEABLE MEMBERS OF THE REFORM CLUB THOUGH HE SEEMED ALWAYS TO AVOID ATTRACTING ATTENTION AN ENIGMATICAL PERSONAGE
WEATHER EVERYTHING HAD GONE SO WELL TILL NOW EARTH AND SEA HAD SEEMED TO BE AT HIS MASTER'S SERVICE STEAMERS AND RAILWAYS OBEYED HIM
ON THE MORNING OF THE FIFTEENTH WHEN SHE WAS DUE ARRIVED THERE ON THE EVENING OF THE FOURTEENTH A GAIN OF FIFTEEN HOURS MISTER FOGG
THE PERSON OF THE DELIGHTFUL FIX ON SUNDAY OCTOBER TWENTIETH TOWARDS NOON THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE INDIAN COAST TWO HOURS LATER THE PILOT CAME ON BOARD
SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT ON THE SIXTH OF NOVEMBER AND THE PASSENGERS FOR JAPAN WOULD HAVE
ABOUT WHOM LITTLE WAS KNOWN EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A POLISHED MAN OF THE WORLD PEOPLE SAID THAT HE RESEMBLED BYRON
AS THE PORT CLOCK STRUCK SHE CAN'T BE FAR OFF NOW RETURNED HIS COMPANION HOW LONG WILL SHE STOP AT SUEZ FOUR HOURS LONG ENOUGH TO GET IN HER COAL
THE TIME PASSED QUICKLY ON THE MONGOLIA THE BEST OF FARE WAS SPREAD UPON THE CABIN TABLES AT BREAKFAST LUNCH DINNER AND THE EIGHT O'CLOCK SUPPER AND THE LADIES
AFTER THE ENGINEERS OF SOLOMON
MINARETS TEMPLES FAKIRS PAGODAS TIGERS SNAKES ELEPHANTS I HOPE YOU WILL HAVE AMPLE TIME TO SEE THE SIGHTS I HOPE SO MONSIEUR FIX YOU SEE
WHISTLES WHICH ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF THE MONGOLIA
TO TAKE IN COAL THIS MATTER OF FUELLING STEAMERS IS A SERIOUS ONE AT SUCH DISTANCES FROM THE COAL MINES IT
IN HIS DELIGHT EXCLAIMING PILOT YOU ARE THE BEST OF GOOD FELLOWS THE PILOT PROBABLY DOES NOT KNOW TO THIS DAY WHY HIS RESPONSES WON HIM THIS ENTHUSIASTIC GREETING
ASKED HE NO IT'S MY MASTER'S AND YOUR MASTER IS HE STAYED ON BOARD
IT WAS HIS NEW MASTER GOING OUT HE HEARD IT SHUT AGAIN IT WAS HIS PREDECESSOR
AND A DOZEN BOATS PUSHED OFF FROM THE SHORE TO GO AND MEET THE STEAMER SOON HER GIGANTIC HULL APPEARED PASSING ALONG BETWEEN THE BANKS AND ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK AS SHE ANCHORED IN THE ROAD
BEGAN QUAVERINGLY TO QUESTION HIM WHERE YEH GOIN JIM WHAT YOU THINKING ABOUT WHERE YOU GOING TELL ME WON'T YOU JIM THE TALL SOLDIER FACED ABOUT AS UPON RELENTLESS PURSUERS
LEAVE ME BE THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE WHILE HE WAITED SUDDENLY HIS FORM STIFFENED AND STRAIGHTENED
I'D DO IT FER YOU WOULDN'T I HENRY HE PAUSED IN PITEOUS ANXIETY TO AWAIT HIS FRIEND'S REPLY THE YOUTH HAD REACHED AN ANGUISH WHERE THE SOBS SCORCHED HIM HE STROVE TO EXPRESS HIS LOYALTY
AND MEN SLOWING TO HIS DREARY PACE WERE WALKING WITH HIM THEY WERE DISCUSSING HIS PLIGHT QUESTIONING HIM AND GIVING HIM ADVICE IN A DOGGED WAY HE REPELLED THEM
AND A HORSE AND A BUFFALO AND A COW AND MONEY AND MANGOES AND FIGS AND DHARMU SAID YES BUT THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO CATCH THE ANIMALS AND THE FRUIT WAS BAD
AND APPEARING WITH THE VALOR AND CONFIDENCE OF UNCONQUERED LEGIONS THE SHRILLING VOICES OF THE PEOPLE AT HOME WOULD PIPE DISMALLY FOR A TIME
AND THREW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW AND IT FELL ON KARAM GOSAIN AND SCALDED HIM AND AS THE FLIES AND INSECTS WORRIED THE WOUND KARAM GOSAIN WENT OFF TO THE GANGES AND BURIED HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM
AND HE DID NOT CONCEIVE PUBLIC OPINION TO BE ACCURATE AT LONG RANGE IT WAS QUITE PROBABLE THEY WOULD HIT THE WRONG MAN WHO AFTER HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS AMAZEMENT WOULD PERHAPS SPEND THE REST OF HIS DAYS
HE WAS A CRAVEN LOON THOSE PICTURES OF GLORY WERE PITEOUS THINGS HE GROANED FROM HIS HEART AND WENT STAGGERING OFF A CERTAIN MOTHLIKE QUALITY WITHIN HIM KEPT HIM IN THE VICINITY OF THE BATTLE
WHILE HE HAD BEEN TOSSED BY MANY EMOTIONS HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF AILMENTS NOW THE BESET HIM
AND THEIR ROBES OF GLORIOUS MEMORIES WERE SHAMS HOWEVER HE STILL SAID THAT IT WAS A GREAT PITY HE WAS NOT AS THEY A DEFEAT OF THE ARMY HAD SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM AS A MEANS OF ESCAPE
THE BODY SEEMED TO BOUNCE A LITTLE WAY FROM THE EARTH GOD SAID THE TATTERED SOLDIER THE YOUTH HAD WATCHED SPELLBOUND THIS CEREMONY AT THE PLACE OF MEETING
SIGNING TO THEM TO GO ON AND LEAVE HIM ALONE THE SHADOWS OF HIS FACE WERE DEEPENING AND HIS TIGHT LIPS SEEMED HOLDING IN CHECK THE MOAN OF GREAT DESPAIR THERE COULD BE SEEN A CERTAIN STIFFNESS IN THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS BODY
BUT HE TOLD HIS BROTHER TO PAY THE LABOURERS FIRST AND IN DOING THIS THE PADDY WAS ALL USED UP AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR DHARMU AND HIS WIFE SO THEY WENT HOME SORROWFULLY AND THEIR CHILDREN CRIED FOR FOOD
THE YOUTH CRIED OUT TO HIM HYSTERICALLY I LL TAKE CARE OF YEH JIM I LL TAKE CARE OF YEH I SWEAR T GAWD I WILL SURE WILL YEH HENRY THE TALL SOLDIER BESEECHED YES YES I TELL YEH I'LL TAKE CARE OF YEH JIM PROTESTED THE YOUTH
THE CLANKING ARMS OF THE COLUMN NEAR HIM MADE HIM SOAR ON THE RED WINGS OF WAR FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS SUBLIME HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO START FOR THE FRONT INDEED HE SAW A PICTURE OF HIMSELF
AND KARAM GOSAIN CAME DOWN TO SEE WHAT PREPARATIONS DHARMU WAS MAKING IN HIS HONOUR AND HE WATCHED FROM THE BACK OF THE HOUSE JUST THEN DHARMU STRAINED OFF THE WATER FROM THE COOKED RICE
JIM JIM WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHAT MAKES YOU DO THIS WAY YOU'LL HURT YERSELF THE SAME PURPOSE WAS IN THE TALL SOLDIER'S FACE
IN HIS EYES THERE WAS A GREAT APPEAL LEAVE ME BE CAN'T YEH LEAVE ME BE FOR A MINNIT THE YOUTH RECOILED WHY JIM HE SAID IN A DAZED WAY WHAT S THE MATTER WITH YOU
THEN AS IF THE HEADS WERE MOVED BY ONE MUSCLE ALL THE FACES WERE TURNED TOWARD HIM WITH WIDE DERISIVE GRINS HE SEEMED TO HEAR SOME ONE MAKE A HUMOROUS REMARK IN A LOW TONE AT IT THE OTHERS ALL CROWED AND CACKLED
THERE WOULD BE A ROUNDABOUT VINDICATION OF HIMSELF HE THOUGHT IT WOULD PROVE IN A MANNER THAT HE HAD FLED EARLY BECAUSE OF HIS SUPERIOR POWERS OF PERCEPTION A SERIOUS PROPHET UPON PREDICTING A FLOOD SHOULD BE THE FIRST MAN TO CLIMB A TREE
THEY WERE AWED AND AFRAID THEY HUNG BACK LEST HE HAVE AT COMMAND A DREADFUL WEAPON AT LAST THEY SAW HIM STOP AND STAND MOTIONLESS HASTENING UP THEY PERCEIVED THAT HIS FACE WORE AN EXPRESSION
HIS FACE WAS SO DRY AND GRIMY THAT HE THOUGHT HE COULD FEEL HIS SKIN CRACKLE EACH BONE OF HIS BODY HAD AN ACHE IN IT AND SEEMINGLY THREATENED TO BREAK WITH EACH MOVEMENT HIS FEET WERE LIKE TWO SORES
THE TALL SOLDIER WEAKLY TRIED TO WRENCH HIMSELF FREE HUH HE SAID VACANTLY HE STARED AT THE YOUTH FOR A MOMENT AT LAST HE SPOKE AS IF DIMLY COMPREHENDING
THEN IT BEGAN TO SWING FORWARD SLOW AND STRAIGHT IN THE MANNER OF A FALLING TREE A SWIFT MUSCULAR CONTORTION MADE THE LEFT SHOULDER STRIKE THE GROUND FIRST
PRESENTLY THE LATTER HEARD A VOICE TALKING SOFTLY NEAR HIS SHOULDER TURNING HE SAW THAT IT BELONGED TO THE TATTERED SOLDIER
THAT PREVIOUSLY THE ARMY HAD ENCOUNTERED GREAT DEFEATS AND IN A FEW MONTHS HAD SHAKEN OFF ALL BLOOD AND TRADITION OF THEM EMERGING AS BRIGHT AND VALIANT AS A NEW ONE THRUSTING OUT OF SIGHT THE MEMORY OF DISASTER
AS HE WAS AT LAST COMPELLED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THEM HIS CAPACITY FOR SELF HATE WAS MULTIPLIED IN DESPAIR HE DECLARED THAT HE WAS NOT LIKE THOSE OTHERS HE NOW CONCEDED IT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD EVER BECOME A HERO
HOLD HOLD AND WHENEVER HIS WIFE PUT OUT HER HAND TO PULL UP THE RICE A VOICE CALLED OUT HOLD HOLD THEN THEY SAID WHO ARE YOU WHO STOP US AND THE VOICE ANSWERED
SO THEY ROSE UP TO GO BACK AND DHARMU ASKED ABOUT THE WOMEN WHOM THEY HAD MET AND KARAM GOSAIN SAID THE WOMAN HAS A STOOL STUCK TO HER BACK BECAUSE WHEN VISITORS CAME SHE NEVER OFFERED THEM A SEAT
AND THEY HAD NOTHING TO GIVE THEM IN THE NIGHT DHARMU'S WIFE SAID THEY PROMISED TO PAY US FOR MERELY LOOKING AFTER THE WORK AND INSTEAD WE WORKED HARD AND HAVE STILL GOT NOTHING WE WILL NOT WORK FOR THEM ANYMORE
PRESENTLY THE CALM HEAD OF A FORWARD GOING COLUMN OF INFANTRY APPEARED IN THE ROAD IT CAME SWIFTLY ON AVOIDING THE OBSTRUCTIONS GAVE IT THE SINUOUS MOVEMENT OF A SERPENT THE MEN AT THE HEAD
DUST STAINED HAGGARD PANTING FLYING TO THE FRONT AT THE PROPER MOMENT TO SEIZE AND THROTTLE THE DARK LEERING WITCH OF CALAMITY THEN THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE THING BEGAN TO DRAG AT HIM HE HESITATED
DOUBTS AND HE WERE STRUGGLING HE WOULD TRULY BE A WORM IF ANY OF HIS COMRADES SHOULD SEE HIM RETURNING THUS THE MARKS OF HIS FLIGHT UPON HIM
HE CLUTCHED THE YOUTH'S ARM AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HIM AS IF DREADING TO BE OVERHEARD THEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK IN A SHAKING WHISPER I TELL YEH WHAT I'M FRAID OF HENRY I'LL TELL YEH WHAT I'M FRAID OF
THE WOODS FILTERED MEN AND THE FIELDS BECAME DOTTED AS HE ROUNDED A HILLOCK HE PERCEIVED THAT THE ROADWAY WAS NOW A CRYING MASS OF WAGONS TEAMS AND MEN
IF THE MEN WERE ADVANCING THEIR INDIFFERENT FEET WERE TRAMPLING UPON HIS CHANCES FOR A SUCCESSFUL LIFE AS THESE THOUGHTS WENT RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS MIND HE TURNED UPON THEM AND TRIED TO THRUST THEM AWAY
THE YOUTH WISHED HIS FRIEND TO LEAN UPON HIM BUT THE OTHER ALWAYS SHOOK HIS HEAD AND STRANGELY PROTESTED NO NO NO LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE HIS LOOK WAS FIXED AGAIN UPON THE UNKNOWN
AND THEY ASKED HOW THEY SHOULD PROPITIATE HIM AND THE VOICE SAID GRIND TURMERIC AND PUT IT ON A PLATE AND BUY NEW CLOTH AND DYE IT WITH TURMERIC AND MAKE READY OIL AND TAKE THESE THINGS TO THE GANGES
HE IMAGINED THE WHOLE REGIMENT SAYING WHERE'S HENRY FLEMING
AS IF HE WERE TAKING INFINITE CARE NOT TO AROUSE THE PASSION OF HIS WOUNDS AS HE WENT ON HE SEEMED ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A PLACE LIKE ONE WHO GOES TO CHOOSE A GRAVE
HE WAS NOT CAST DOWN BY THIS DEFEAT OF HIS PLAN FOR UPON STUDYING THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY HE COULD NOT BUT ADMIT THAT THE OBJECTIONS WERE VERY FORMIDABLE FURTHERMORE VARIOUS AILMENTS HAD BEGUN TO CRY OUT
THERE WAS A REPLY THAT THE INTENT FIGHTERS DID NOT CARE FOR WHAT HAPPENED REARWARD SAVING THAT NO HOSTILE BAYONETS APPEARED THERE IN THE BATTLE BLUR HIS FACE WOULD IN A WAY BE HIDDEN LIKE THE FACE OF A COWLED MAN
BUT AS HE MORTALLY FEARED THESE SHAFTS IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO INVENT A TALE HE FELT HE COULD TRUST HE EXPERIMENTED WITH MANY SCHEMES BUT THREW THEM ASIDE ONE BY ONE AS FLIMSY
HIS FACE HAD BEEN TWISTED INTO AN EXPRESSION OF EVERY AGONY HE HAD IMAGINED FOR HIS FRIEND HE NOW SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND GOING CLOSER GAZED UPON THE PASTELIKE FACE THE MOUTH WAS OPEN AND THE TEETH
BUT THEY SAID IT IS NO LOW CASTE PERSON BUT DHARMU THEN THEY BATHED HIM AND ANOINTED HIM WITH OIL AND TURMERIC AND WRAPPED HIM IN THE NEW CLOTH WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT AND THUS THEY PERSUADED HIM TO RETURN
HE SEATED HIMSELF AND WATCHED THE TERROR STRICKEN WAGONS THEY FLED LIKE SOFT UNGAINLY ANIMALS ALL THE ROARERS AND LASHERS SERVED TO HELP HIM TO MAGNIFY THE DANGERS AND HORRORS OF THE ENGAGEMENT
KARAM GOSAIN PROMISED THEM THAT ON THEIR WAY BACK THEY SHOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF ALL AND THEY DID SO AND MOUNTED ON THE ELEPHANT AND RETURNED TO THEIR HOME WITH GREAT WEALTH
HE TOLD DHARMU AND HIS WIFE TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND COME AND EAT BUT THEY ANSWERED THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE HOUSEHOLD AND THAT THE HIRED LABOURERS SHOULD BE FED FIRST SO THE LABOURERS ATE AND THEY ATE UP ALL THE RICE
THUS MANY MEN OF COURAGE HE CONSIDERED WOULD BE OBLIGED TO DESERT THE COLORS AND SCURRY LIKE CHICKENS HE WOULD APPEAR AS ONE OF THEM THEY WOULD BE SULLEN BROTHERS IN DISTRESS AND HE COULD THEN EASILY BELIEVE
FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FALL HE CONSIDERED NOW HOWEVER THAT IT WAS USELESS TO THINK OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY
AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR DHARMU AND HIS WIFE WHEN THE MIDDAY MEAL WAS BROUGHT THE SAME THING HAPPENED
ALSO HE CONTINUED IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE IF HE FOUND HIS REGIMENT WELL HE COULD FIGHT WITH ANY REGIMENT HE STARTED FORWARD SLOWLY HE STEPPED AS IF HE EXPECTED TO TREAD UPON SOME EXPLOSIVE THING
TO FORCE THEIR WAY TO GRIM CHANCES OF DEATH AS HE WATCHED HIS ENVY GREW UNTIL HE THOUGHT THAT HE WISHED TO CHANGE LIVES WITH ONE OF THEM HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE USED A TREMENDOUS FORCE HE SAID THROW OFF HIMSELF AND BECOME A BETTER
KARMU WAS A FARMER AND DHARMU WAS A TRADER ONCE WHEN DHARMU WAS AWAY FROM HOME KARMU GAVE A RELIGIOUS FEAST AND DID NOT INVITE DHARMU'S HOUSEHOLD WHEN DHARMU RETURNED AND LEARNT THIS
AND THEN SEND ME TO SUCH A PLACE IN THE MORNING BUT HAPPILY FOR THE GENERAL PEACE THINGS DID NOT ARRIVE AT SUCH A DESPERATE PASS BEFORE WE WERE OUT OF THE GATE MY HEART LEAPED WITH JOY FOR I HEARD MY FATHER CALLING MISSUS MITCHELL MISSUS MITCHELL
AT LEAST I HAVE LEARNED TO MODIFY THE ASSERTION ONLY TO THIS EXTENT
I CANNOT TELL ANY BETTER THAN MOST OF MY READERS HOW AND WHEN I BEGAN TO COME AWAKE OR WHAT IT WAS THAT WAKENED ME I MEAN I CANNOT REMEMBER WHEN I BEGAN TO REMEMBER OR WHAT FIRST GOT SET DOWN IN MY MEMORY AS WORTH REMEMBERING
EVEN IF HER EYES HAD NOT BEEN FIERCE WITH SUPPRESSED INDIGNATION I HAVEN'T HAD MY PORRIDGE I SAID YOUR PORRIDGE IS WAITING YOU AS COLD AS A STONE SHE ANSWERED IF BOYS WILL LIE IN BED SO LATE
BUT MINE AND THOSE OF TWO OF MY BROTHERS WAS FIXED UPON HIM I THINK HOWEVER THAT IT WAS IN PART THE FAULT OF CERTAIN TEACHING OF HIS OWN BETTER FITTED FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE PAID SO LITTLE HEED EVEN TOM WITH ALL HIS STARING
CHAPTER THREE MY FATHER MY FATHER WAS A TALL STAID SOLEMN MAN WHO WALKED SLOWLY WITH LONG STRIDES HE SPOKE VERY LITTLE
TURN HIS FACE TOWARDS THE TWO BEDS WHERE WE THREE LAY WIDE AWAKE AND TELL US STORY AFTER STORY OUT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT SOMETIMES READING A FEW VERSES
AND THAT I FELL DOWN THE LADDER INTO THE ROOM AGAIN AND AWOKE AS ONE ALWAYS DOES WITH A FALL IN A DREAM SUN MOON AND STARS WERE GONE THE LADDER OF LIGHT HAD VANISHED AND I LAY SOBBING ON MY PILLOW
THERE SHE SET MY PORRIDGE BEFORE ME WHICH I DECLINED TO EAT WELL IF YOU WON'T EAT GOOD FOOD YOU SHALL GO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT IT I TELL YOU I WON'T GO TO SCHOOL SHE CAUGHT ME UP IN HER ARMS
I'M SURE SIR SAID MISSUS MITCHELL PUTTING HER BLUE STRIPED APRON TO HER EYES I ASKED YOUR OPINION BEFORE I TOOK HIM I BELIEVE I DID SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ITS BEING TIME HE WERE ABLE TO READ
I DID NOT CARE MUCH FOR KISSES THEN FOR I HAD NOT LEARNED HOW GOOD THEY ARE BUT SOMEHOW I FANCIED AFTERWARDS THAT THE WIND WAS MADE OF MY BABY BROTHER'S KISSES AND I BEGAN TO LOVE THE LITTLE MAN WHO HAD LIVED ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO BE OUR BROTHER
AND GENERALLY LOOKED AS IF HE WERE PONDERING NEXT SUNDAY'S SERMON HIS HEAD WAS GREY AND A LITTLE BENT AS IF HE WERE GATHERING TRUTH FROM THE GROUND ONCE I CAME UPON HIM IN THE GARDEN STANDING WITH HIS FACE UP TO HEAVEN
THAT'S ALL VERY FINE BUT I KNOW SOMETHING A GOOD DEAL FINER NOW WASH YOUR FACE I WON'T SO LONG AS YOU STAND THERE I SAID AND SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS ME IF YOU TOUCH ME I'LL SCREAM
AS FAR AS I CAN JUDGE TO THE AWE AND RESPECT THEY FEEL WHEN THEY ENTER THE MORE BEAUTIFUL CHURCHES OF THEIR COUNTRY THERE WAS A HUSH IN IT WHICH DEMANDED A REFRAINING OF THE FOOT A TREADING SOFTLY AS UPON HOLY GROUND
I WAS TOO WELL SATISFIED TO URGE MY VICTORY BY FURTHER COMPLAINT
HE LOOKED SO SAD I HAVE SAID THAT AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER SHE WAS AN INVALID HENCE SHE WAS UNABLE TO BE MUCH WITH US SHE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL IN MY MEMORY BUT DURING THE LAST MONTHS OF HER LIFE WE SELDOM SAW HER
AND WERE TALKING VERY EARNESTLY AND ALL THE STARS HAD GATHERED ROUND THEM I COULD NOT HEAR A WORD THEY SAID BUT I CONCLUDED THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT MY LITTLE BROTHER I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE SORRY I SAID TO MYSELF AND I TRIED HARD BUT I COULD NOT FEEL SORRY
OR IF I PREFERRED WHICH I CONFESS I OFTEN DID STUDY A RARE SIGHT IN SCOTCH CHURCHES THE FIGURE OF AN ARMED KNIGHT CARVED IN STONE WHICH LAY ON THE TOP OF THE TOMB OF SIR WORM WYMBLE AT LEAST
BUT I DOUBT VERY MUCH WHETHER SHE IS FIT TO HAVE THE CHARGE OF CHILDREN AND AS SHE IS A FRIEND OF YOURS YOU WILL BE DOING HER A KINDNESS TO GIVE HER A HINT TO THAT EFFECT IT MAY SAVE THE NECESSITY FOR MY TAKING FURTHER AND MORE UNPLEASANT STEPS
YOU ARE A BAD BOY WHY AM I A BAD BOY I RETORTED IT'S BAD NOT TO DO WHAT YOU ARE TOLD I WILL DO WHAT MY PAPA TELLS ME YOUR PAPA THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE THAN YOUR PAPA IN THE WORLD
AND SHE NODDING BACK TO HIM WITH A KNOWING LOOK AND THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH DRAWN DOWN I HAVE VAGUE MEMORIES OF HAVING HEARD THEM TALK AT TIMES I FEEL AS IF I COULD YET RECALL SOMETHING OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT IT VANISHES THE MOMENT I TRY TO CATCH IT
YOU WILL TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT SOME DAY YES AND WE SHALL TELL OUR MOTHERS SHALL WE NOT HOW SORRY WE ARE THAT WE EVER GAVE THEM ANY TROUBLE SOMETIMES WE WERE VERY NAUGHTY AND SOMETIMES WE DID NOT KNOW BETTER MY MOTHER WAS VERY GOOD
MY ENEMY MISSUS MITCHELL CAME INTO THE ROOM LOOKING TRIUMPHANT AND REVENGEFUL I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE GETTING UP SHE SAID IT'S NEARLY SCHOOL TIME THE TONE AND THE EMPHASIS SHE LAID ON THE WORD SCHOOL
EXCEPT THE LAMBS OF THE FLOCK MISSUS MITCHELL I LIKE YOU FOR STANDING UP FOR YOUR FRIEND BUT IS A WOMAN BECAUSE SHE IS LONE AND A WIDOW TO MAKE A MOLOCH OF HERSELF AND HAVE THE CHILDREN SACRIFICED TO HER IN THAT WAY
OR IN THE COLD WINTER NIGHTS HE WOULD COME INTO THE ROOM WHERE I AND MY TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS SLEPT THE NURSERY IT WAS AND SITTING DOWN WITH TOM BY HIS SIDE BEFORE THE FIRE THAT BURNED BRIGHT IN THE FROSTY AIR WOULD OPEN THE GREAT FAMILY BIBLE ON THE TABLE
AND THE WINDOW WAS GONE BUT THE CEILING WAS A CEILING INDEED FOR THE SUN MOON AND STARS LIVED THERE THE SUN WAS NOT A SCIENTIFIC SUN AT ALL
BUT THE SUN AND THE MOON HAD REGULAR MOTIONS ROSE AND SET AT THE PROPER TIMES FOR THEY WERE STEADY OLD FOLKS I DO NOT HOWEVER REMEMBER EVER SEEING THEM RISE OR SET THEY WERE ALWAYS UP AND NEAR THE CENTRE BEFORE THE DREAM DAWNED ON ME
THESE GAVE ENTIRE SATISFACTION TO THOSE OF HIS PARISHIONERS WHOM I HAPPENED TO HEAR SPEAK OF THEM BUT ALTHOUGH I LOVED THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE AND LIKED TO LOOK AT HIS FACE AS HE STOOD UP THERE IN THE ANCIENT PULPIT CLAD IN HIS GOWN AND BANDS I NEVER CARED MUCH ABOUT WHAT HE SAID
MEANTIME I OBSERVED A CURIOUS MOTION IN THE HEAVENLY HOST THEY KEPT LOOKING AT ME AND THEN AT THE CORNER WHERE THE LADDER STOOD AND TALKING ON FOR I SAW THEIR LIPS MOVING VERY FAST AND I THOUGHT BY THE MOTION OF THEM THAT THEY WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THE LADDER
FROM THAT HOUR I BELIEVE SHE HATED ME MY FATHER LOOKED AFTER HER WITH A SMILE AND THEN LOOKED DOWN ON ME SAYING SHE'S SHORT IN THE TEMPER POOR WOMAN AND WE MUSTN'T PROVOKE HER
CHAPTER SEVEN MISSUS MITCHELL IS DEFEATED AFTER THIS TALK WITH MY FATHER I FELL INTO A SLEEP OF PERFECT CONTENTMENT AND NEVER THOUGHT OF WHAT MIGHT BE ON THE MORROW TILL THE MORROW CAME
THE RAIN POURING SO THICK THAT I PUT OUT MY HAND IN FRONT OF ME TO TRY WHETHER I COULD SEE IT THROUGH THE VEIL OF THE FALLING WATER THE RIVER WHICH IN GENERAL WAS TO BE SEEN ONLY IN GLIMPSES FROM THE HOUSE FOR IT RAN AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLLOW
HE USED TO WALK MUCH ABOUT HIS FIELDS ESPECIALLY OF A SUMMER MORNING BEFORE THE SUN WAS UP THIS WAS AFTER MY MOTHER'S DEATH I PRESUME HE FELT NEARER TO HER IN THE FIELDS THAN IN THE HOUSE THERE WAS A KIND OF GRANDEUR ABOUT HIM I AM SURE
AND SEEING ALL HIS OWN BROTHERS COMING RIDING TOWARDS HIM OR THE GRAND RUSH OF THE SEA WAVES OVER THE BEWILDERED HOSTS OF THE EGYPTIANS WE LAY AND LISTENED WITH ALL THE MORE ENJOYMENT THAT WHILE THE FIRE WAS BURNING SO BRIGHTLY
WHICH IN SHAKSPERE FASHION HE PRESENTED AFTER THE MODES AND WAYS OF OUR OWN COUNTRY AND TIME I SHALL NEVER FORGET JOSEPH IN EGYPT HEARING THE PATTERING OF THE ASSES HOOFS IN THE STREET AND THROWING UP THE WINDOW AND LOOKING OUT
KNEW AS LITTLE ABOUT THE SERMON AS ANY OF US BUT MY FATHER DID NOT QUESTION US MUCH CONCERNING IT HE DID WHAT WAS FAR BETTER ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS IN THE WARM PEACEFUL SUNLIGHT OF SUMMER WITH THE HONEYSUCKLE FILLING THE AIR OF THE LITTLE ARBOUR IN WHICH WE SAT
PAPA PAPA I SOBBED DON'T SEND ME TO THAT HORRID SCHOOL I CAN LEARN TO READ WITHOUT THAT OLD WOMAN TO TEACH ME REALLY MISSUS MITCHELL SAID MY FATHER TAKING ME BY THE HAND AND LEADING ME TOWARDS HER WHERE SHE STOOD VISIBLY FLAMING WITH RAGE AND ANNOYANCE
ONE ONLY I CAN RECALL AND IT I WILL RELATE OR MORE PROPERLY DESCRIBE FOR THERE WAS HARDLY ANYTHING DONE IN IT I DREAMED IT OFTEN IT WAS OF THE ROOM I SLEPT IN ONLY IT WAS NARROWER IN THE DREAM AND LOFTIER
SOMETIMES I FANCY IT MUST HAVE BEEN A TREMENDOUS FLOOD THAT FIRST MADE ME WONDER AND SO MADE ME BEGIN TO REMEMBER AT ALL EVENTS I DO REMEMBER ONE FLOOD THAT SEEMS ABOUT AS FAR OFF AS ANYTHING
THAT I CAN HAVE NO CONFIDENCE THAT ONE OF THESE IS IN REALITY THE OLDEST THING I REMEMBER INDEED I HAVE A SUSPICION THAT MY OLDEST MEMORIES ARE OF DREAMS WHERE OR WHEN DREAMED THE GOOD ONE WHO MADE ME ONLY KNOWS THEY ARE VERY VAGUE TO ME NOW
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT I TELL YOU I WON'T GO AND I TELL YOU WE'LL SEE ABOUT IT I WON'T GO TILL I'VE SEEN PAPA IF HE SAYS I'M TO GO I WILL OF COURSE BUT I WON'T GO FOR YOU
I THEREFORE YIELDED FOR THE TIME AND FELL TO PLANNING NOR WAS I LONG IN COMING TO A RESOLUTION I DREW THE PIN THAT HAD SCRATCHED ME FROM HER DRESS I BELIEVED SHE WOULD NOT CARRY ME VERY FAR BUT IF SHE DID NOT SET ME DOWN SOON I RESOLVED TO MAKE HER GLAD TO DO SO
THAT IT WAS A LADDER OF RAYS THERE COULD HOWEVER BE NO DOUBT IF ONLY I COULD CLIMB UPON IT I OFTEN TRIED BUT FAST AS I LIFTED MY FEET TO CLIMB DOWN THEY CAME AGAIN UPON THE BOARDS OF THE FLOOR
SHE LITTLE KNEW WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN MY FATHER AND ME ALREADY
AND THE CHURCH WAS INSEPARABLY ASSOCIATED WITH MY FATHER THE PEW WE SAT IN WAS A SQUARE ONE WITH A TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT FOR OUR BOOKS MY BROTHER DAVID GENERALLY USED IT FOR LAYING HIS HEAD UPON THAT HE MIGHT GO TO SLEEP COMFORTABLY
WAS OUTSPREAD LIKE A SEA IN FRONT AND STRETCHED AWAY FAR ON EITHER HAND IT WAS A LITTLE STREAM BUT IT FILLS SO MUCH OF MY MEMORY WITH ITS REGULAR RECURRENCE OF AUTUMNAL FLOODS
THAT IS THE NEAREST I CAN COME TO THE SPELLING OF THE NAME THEY GAVE HIM THE TOMB WAS CLOSE BY THE SIDE OF THE PEW WITH ONLY A FLAGGED PASSAGE BETWEEN IT STOOD IN A HOLLOW IN THE WALL AND THE KNIGHT LAY UNDER THE ARCH OF THE RECESS SO SILENT SO PATIENT
BUT I RECOLLECT NOTHING MORE YOU MUST HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD ME HE ADDED WILLING TO EASE HER DESCENT TO THE VALLEY OF HER HUMILIATION SHE WALKED AWAY WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD SNIFFING THE AIR AS SHE WENT
MY BROTHER ALLISTER WHOSE BACK WAS TO THE PULPIT USED TO LEARN THE PARAPHRASES ALL THE TIME OF THE SERMON I HAPPIEST OF ALL IN MY POSITION COULD LOOK UP AT MY FATHER IF I PLEASED A LITTLE SIDEWAYS
OF COURSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND A BETTER SERMON THAN ANY OTHER CLERGYMAN WHATEVER COULD HAVE PREACHED BUT WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ME I MAY AS WELL CONFESS AT ONCE THAT I NEVER HAD THE LEAST DOUBT THAT MY FATHER WAS THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD
BUT I CANNOT REMEMBER A SINGLE ONE OF THE MANY KISSES SHE MUST HAVE GIVEN ME I REMEMBER HER HOLDING MY HEAD TO HER BOSOM WHEN SHE WAS DYING
I CRIED SHE STOPPED THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT AND BOUNCED OUT OF THE ROOM BUT I HEARD HER TURN THE KEY OF THE DOOR I PROCEEDED WITH MY DRESSING AS FAST AS I COULD THEN AND THE MOMENT I WAS READY OPENED THE WINDOW
FURTHER I RESOLVED THAT WHEN WE CAME TO THE FOOT BRIDGE WHICH HAD BUT ONE RAIL TO IT I WOULD RUN THE PIN INTO HER AND MAKE HER LET ME GO WHEN I WOULD INSTANTLY THROW MYSELF INTO THE RIVER FOR I WOULD RUN THE RISK OF BEING DROWNED RATHER THAN GO TO THAT SCHOOL
YOU WILL AND YOU WON'T SHE REPEATED STANDING STARING AT ME AS I LEISURELY BUT WITH HANDS TREMBLING PARTLY WITH FEAR PARTLY WITH RAGE WAS FASTENING MY NETHER GARMENTS TO MY WAISTCOAT
WHAT CAN THEY EXPECT NOTHING FROM YOU I MUTTERED WITH MORE HARDIHOOD THAN I HAD YET SHOWN HER WHAT'S THAT YOU'RE SAYING SHE ASKED ANGRILY I WAS SILENT MAKE HASTE SHE WENT ON
NOW DO BE PERSUADED FOR YOUR OWN GOOD ASK FOR A GOOD FAT MEGATHERIUM AND HAVE DONE WITH IT THANK YOU NOT TO DAY I THINK SAID CYRIL CAUTIOUSLY WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SAY WAS YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS WISHING FOR THINGS WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AT ANYTHING
A YOUNG MAN WHO WORE THE SAME LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE WHICH JUST BEFORE THEY HAD ACTUALLY SEEN GROWING UPON THE BABY'S LIP THIS THEN WAS THE LAMB GROWN UP THEIR OWN LAMB IT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT
NOT IF I CAN STOP IT WE MUST TAME HIM BY KINDNESS SAID JANE YOU SEE SAID ROBERT IF HE GROWS UP IN THE USUAL WAY
WHO OF COURSE AFTER SUNSET WOULD BE A BABY AGAIN THE MAN TO MAN TONE SUCCEEDED I SHALL JUST RUN OVER TO MAIDSTONE ON MY BIKE SAID THE NEW LAMB AIRILY FINGERING THE LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE I CAN LUNCH AT THE CROWN AND PERHAPS I'LL HAVE A PULL ON THE RIVER
I SELDOM PLAY
RUN ALONG HOME LIKE GOOD CHILDREN THE POSITION WAS DESPERATE
YOUR BIKE'S RUN DOWN SAID ROBERT WONDERING HOW HE COULD SO SOON HAVE LEARNED TO DECEIVE SO IT IS SAID CYRIL IT'S A PUNCTURE SAID ANTHEA STOOPING DOWN AND STANDING UP AGAIN WITH A THORN WHICH SHE HAD GOT READY FOR THE PURPOSE LOOK HERE
THE GROWN UP LAMB MOVED GRACEFULLY ACROSS THE MOSS AND SETTLED HIMSELF AGAINST THE TRUNK OF THE SWEET CHESTNUT HE TILTED THE STRAW HAT OVER HIS EYES HE WAS EVIDENTLY WEARY HE WAS GOING TO SLEEP THE LAMB THE ORIGINAL LITTLE TIRESOME BELOVED LAMB
THIS WAS PAID FOR OUT OF THE FIFTEEN SHILLINGS WHICH HAD BEEN EARNED BY ROBERT WHEN HE WAS A GIANT FOR THE LAMB IT APPEARED HAD UNFORTUNATELY NO MONEY ABOUT HIM THIS WAS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE OTHERS BUT IT IS A THING THAT WILL HAPPEN EVEN TO THE MOST GROWN UP OF US HOWEVER
YOU'RE VERY KIND SAID THE LADY LOOKING AT THE LAMB SHE LOOKED RATHER SHY BUT AS THE BOYS PUT IT THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY NONSENSE ABOUT HER BUT OH WHISPERED CYRIL BEHIND THE PIG PAIL I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE'D HAD ENOUGH BICYCLE MENDING FOR ONE DAY
WITHERED HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH A GLANCE AND THEN SAID TO THE LADY WITH WHOM HE SEEMED TO BE QUITE FRIENDLY IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL RIDE WITH YOU AS FAR AS THE CROSS ROADS IT IS GETTING LATE AND THERE ARE TRAMPS ABOUT
SAID JANE OH BOTHER NUTS SAID ROBERT BUT DINNER'S DIFFERENT
IT GREW THINNER AND LARGER LINES CAME IN THE FOREHEAD THE EYES GREW MORE DEEP SET AND DARKER IN COLOUR THE MOUTH GREW LONGER AND THINNER MOST TERRIBLE OF ALL A LITTLE DARK MOUSTACHE APPEARED ON THE LIP OF ONE WHO WAS STILL EXCEPT AS TO THE FACE
TAKE HIM REPEATED CYRIL YES DO IT'S ALL MY FAULT I DON'T DENY THAT BUT YOU'LL FIND YOU'VE GOT YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU IF YOU TRY TO TAKE THAT YOUNG MAN ANYWHERE THE LAMB ALWAYS WAS SPOILT BUT NOW HE'S GROWN UP HE'S A DEMON SIMPLY
CYRIL DRESSED HASTILY HE DID NOT TAKE A BATH BECAUSE TIN BATHS ARE SO NOISY AND HE HAD NO WISH TO ROUSE ROBERT AND HE SLIPPED OFF ALONE AS ANTHEA HAD ONCE DONE AND RAN THROUGH THE DEWY MORNING TO THE SAND PIT
IT FELL TO JANE'S LOT TO WAKEN THE GROWN UP LAMB SHE DID IT GENTLY BY TICKLING HIS NOSE WITH A TWIG OF WILD HONEYSUCKLE HE SAID
AND THE CHILDREN COULD NOT HEAR WHAT SHE SAID THOUGH THEY WERE CRANING ROUND THE CORNER BY THE PIG PAIL AND LISTENING WITH ALL THEIR EARS THEY FELT IT TO BE PERFECTLY FAIR AS ROBERT SAID WITH THAT WRETCHED LAMB IN THAT CONDITION WHEN THE LAMB SPOKE IN A LANGUID VOICE HEAVY WITH POLITENESS THEY HEARD WELL ENOUGH
INTO THEIR OWN DEAR TIRESOME BABY BROTHER BUT HE IN HIS GROWN UPNESS INSISTED ON GOING ON AND THUS HE WAS MET IN THE FRONT GARDEN BY MARTHA NOW YOU REMEMBER THAT AS A SPECIAL FAVOUR
THE LAMB WAS PULLING UP THE MOSS BY FAT HANDFULS AND CYRIL WAS GLOOMILY CONTEMPLATING THE RUINS OF HIS WATCH HE DOES GROW SAID ANTHEA DOESN'T OO PRECIOUS ME GROW
SHE EXPLAINED TURNING TO THE LADY WHO WITH TREMBLING HANDS WAS NOW TURNING HER BICYCLE TOWARDS THE GATE AND WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF HIM AND WE MUST GET HIM HOME BEFORE SUNSET OR I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER WILL BECOME OF US YOU SEE HE'S SORT OF UNDER A SPELL ENCHANTED YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
WHAT'S THE GIDDY HOUR YOU'LL BE LATE FOR YOUR GRUB I KNOW WE SHALL SAID ROBERT BITTERLY THEN CUT ALONG HOME SAID THE GROWN UP LAMB WHAT ABOUT YOUR GRUB THOUGH ASKED JANE
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME SINCE PEOPLE LEFT OFF EATING REALLY WHOLESOME THINGS HOWEVER HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY GOOD BYE GOOD BYE SAID CYRIL POLITELY I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
OF COURSE ROBERT UNDERSTOOD AT ONCE THAT IF THE LAMB WAS GROWN UP HE MUST HAVE A BICYCLE THIS HAD ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF ROBERT'S OWN REASONS FOR WISHING TO BE GROWN UP HE HASTILY BEGAN TO USE THE PIN ELEVEN PUNCTURES IN THE BACK TYRE SEVEN IN THE FRONT
YOU TRUST TO ME OLD CHAP AND COME HOME NOW AND IF YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF IN THE MORNING WE'LL ASK THE MILKMAN TO ASK THE DOCTOR TO COME THE POOR GROWN UP LAMB SAINT MAUR WAS REALLY ONE OF HIS CHRISTIAN NAMES SEEMED NOW TOO BEWILDERED TO RESIST
SAID CYRIL AFTER THE LAMB HAD TAKEN HIS WATCH OUT OF HIS POCKET WHILE HE WASN'T NOTICING AND WITH COOS AND CLUCKS OF NAUGHTY RAPTURE HAD OPENED THE CASE AND USED THE WHOLE THING AS A GARDEN SPADE
IT REPLIED POLITELY AND NOW WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU IT SAID I SUPPOSE YOU'VE COME HERE SO EARLY TO ASK FOR SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF
THEY ALL WISHED SO HARD INDEED THAT THEY FELT QUITE GIDDY AND ALMOST LOST CONSCIOUSNESS BUT THE WISHING WAS QUITE VAIN FOR WHEN THE WOOD CEASED TO WHIRL ROUND THEIR DAZZLED EYES WERE RIVETED AT ONCE BY THE SPECTACLE OF A VERY PROPER LOOKING YOUNG MAN IN FLANNELS AND A STRAW HAT
OR HAD HIS MIND GROWN UP TOGETHER WITH HIS BODY THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH THE OTHERS IN A HURRIED COUNCIL HELD AMONG THE YELLOWING BRACKEN A FEW YARDS FROM THE SLEEPER DEBATED EAGERLY WHICHEVER IT IS IT'LL BE JUST AS AWFUL SAID ANTHEA IF HIS INSIDE SENSES ARE GROWN UP TOO
SOMETIMES CALLED SAINT MAUR IN THESE PAGES I DON'T KNOW HE LIED MISERABLY
WAS GONE FOR EVER FOR EVER SAID CYRIL BECAUSE AS SOON AS EVER THE LAMB'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE BULLIED WE MUST JOLLY WELL BEGIN TO BULLY HIM FOR HIS OWN SAKE SO THAT HE MAYN'T GROW UP LIKE THAT YOU SHAN'T BULLY HIM SAID ANTHEA STOUTLY
IT WAS A GLOOMY PARTY THAT WENT HOME THROUGH THE SOFT EVENING DURING ANTHEA'S REMARKS ROBERT HAD AGAIN MADE PLAY WITH THE PIN AND THE BICYCLE TYRE AND THE LAMB WHOM THEY HAD TO CALL SAINT MAUR OR DEVEREUX OR HILARY
ASKED THE LADY NOT UNNATURALLY WHILE DEVEREUX AS I MUST TERM THE GROWN UP LAMB TRIED VAINLY TO PUSH ANTHEA AWAY THE OTHERS BACKED HER UP AND SHE STOOD SOLID AS A ROCK YOU JUST LET HIM GO WITH YOU SAID ANTHEA YOU'LL SOON SEE WHAT I MEAN
THAT ONLY THAT VERY MORNING HE HAD BEEN A CHUBBY CHILD OF TWO YEARS BREAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S WATERBURY WATCHES DEVEREUX AS HE OUGHT TO BE CALLED FOR THE FUTURE TOOK OUT A GOLD WATCH WHEN HE HAD MENDED THE LADY'S BICYCLE AND ALL THE ONLOOKERS BEHIND THE PIG PAIL SAID OH
AND WE'LL GO ON THE RIVER AFTERWARDS I'M INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU SAID THE LAMB COURTEOUSLY BUT I SHOULD PREFER SOLITUDE GO HOME TO YOUR LUNCH I MEAN YOUR DINNER PERHAPS I MAY LOOK IN ABOUT TEA TIME
TWICE AND THEN OPENED HIS EYES
A RELIC OF FOOLISH AND FAR OFF CHILDHOOD THIS WAS AWFUL HE WAS THEIR ELDER BROTHER NOW WAS HE WELL OF COURSE HE WAS IF HE WAS GROWN UP SINCE THEY WEREN'T THUS
HE SAID BITTERLY I SUPPOSE I HAD BETTER TAKE YOU HOME BUT YOU'RE NOT TO SUPPOSE I SHALL PASS THIS OVER
HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE INDEED RATHER DIRTY BECAUSE EARLIER IN THE DAY THE LAMB IN HIS INFANT STATE HAD SPRINKLED A GOOD DEAL OF GARDEN SOIL OVER THEM THE GROWN UP LAMB'S VOICE WAS SO TYRANT LIKE AS JANE SAID AFTERWARDS THAT THEY ACTUALLY RETREATED TO THE BACK GARDEN
WERE MAKING THE CHILDREN WISE BEYOND THEIR YEARS DEAR HILARY SAID ANTHEA
ONE OF WHOSE NAMES WAS DEVEREUX SAYING ME LOVE PANTY WANTS TO COME TO OWN PANTY OH LET'S GET HOME FOR GOODNESS SAKE SHE SAID YOU SHALL SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE IN THE MORNING IF YOU CAN SHE ADDED IN A WHISPER
AND ELECTRIFIED HER RELATIVES AT DINNER BY TELLING THEM OF HER ESCAPE FROM A FAMILY OF DANGEROUS LUNATICS THE LITTLE GIRL'S EYES WERE SIMPLY THOSE OF A MANIAC I CAN'T THINK HOW SHE CAME TO BE AT LARGE SHE SAID WHEN HER BICYCLE HAD WHIZZED AWAY DOWN THE ROAD
AND IF SHE ONLY KNEW THAT REALLY AND TRULY HE'S ONLY A WHINY PINY SILLY LITTLE BABY HE'S NOT ANTHEA MURMURED ANGRILY HE'S A DEAR IF PEOPLE ONLY LET HIM ALONE IT'S OUR OWN PRECIOUS LAMB STILL WHATEVER SILLY IDIOTS MAY TURN HIM INTO ISN'T HE PUSSY
AND LEFT HIM WITH HIS LITTLE MOUSTACHE AND HIS FLANNEL SUIT TO MEET ALONE THE YOUNG LADY WHO NOW CAME UP THE FRONT GARDEN WHEELING A BICYCLE THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE CAME OUT AND THE YOUNG LADY SPOKE TO HER
THERE WAS AND WHEN THE NUMBER OF PUNCTURES HAD BEEN MADE MANIFEST IT WAS FELT TO BE A SPECIAL BLESSING THAT THE COTTAGE PROVIDED TEAS FOR CYCLISTS IT PROVIDED AN ODD SORT OF TEA AND HAMMY MEAL FOR THE LAMB AND HIS BROTHERS
CYRIL HAD PERSUADED THE OTHERS TO AGREE TO HIS PLAN AND NOT TO WISH FOR ANYTHING MORE TILL THEY REALLY DID WISH IT MEANTIME IT SEEMED GOOD TO GO TO THE WOODS FOR NUTS AND ON THE MOSSY GRASS UNDER A SWEET CHESTNUT TREE THE FIVE WERE SITTING
THE PICTURE MOVED ANTHEA ALMOST TO TEARS OH NO LAMB DUCKY YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT SHE CRIED INCAUTIOUSLY THE GROWN UP LAMB FROWNED MY DEAR ANTHEA HE SAID
AND THIS THOUGHT FILLED HIS MIND WHEN HE HAPPENED TO WAKE EARLY ON THE MORNING AFTER THE MORNING AFTER ROBERT HAD WISHED TO BE BIGGER THAN THE BAKER'S BOY AND HAD BEEN IT THE DAY THAT LAY BETWEEN THESE TWO DAYS HAD BEEN OCCUPIED ENTIRELY BY GETTING THE GOVERNESS CART HOME FROM BENENHURST
JANE DOUBTFULLY SUPPOSED SO NOW THE LAMB WHOM I MUST TRY TO REMEMBER TO CALL SAINT MAUR WAS EXAMINING THE LADY'S BICYCLE AND TALKING TO HER WITH A VERY GROWN UP MANNER INDEED NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE SUPPOSED TO SEE AND HEAR HIM
YOU CAN TAKE THAT FOR SETTLED AND SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
AN EXPRESSION OF INTENSE HORROR AND ANNOYANCE WAS SEEN ON HIS FACE BUT MARTHA WAS STRONGER THAN HE SHE LIFTED HIM UP AND CARRIED HIM INTO THE HOUSE NONE OF THE CHILDREN WILL EVER FORGET THAT PICTURE
HE WON'T STAND OUR LOOKING AFTER HIM AND IF HE'S STILL A BABY INSIDE OF HIM HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO GET HIM TO DO ANYTHING AND IT'LL BE GETTING ON FOR DINNER TIME IN A MINUTE
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW WHAT ANSWER THE YOUNG LADY INTENDED TO GIVE TO THIS GALLANT OFFER FOR DIRECTLY ANTHEA HEARD IT MADE SHE RUSHED OUT KNOCKING AGAINST THE PIG PAIL
A TWO YEAR OLD BABY IN A LINEN SMOCK AND WHITE OPEN WORK SOCKS OH I WISH IT WOULDN'T OH I WISH IT WOULDN'T YOU BOYS MIGHT WISH AS WELL THEY ALL WISHED HARD FOR THE SIGHT WAS ENOUGH TO DISMAY THE MOST HEARTLESS
A PUNCTURE HE WAS SAYING CAN I NOT BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU COULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A STIFLED EXPLOSION OF LAUGHTER BEHIND THE PIG PAIL THE GROWN UP LAMB OTHERWISE DEVEREUX TURNED THE TAIL OF AN ANGRY EYE IN ITS DIRECTION
SO THE MACHINE WAS WHEELED THE SUN WAS JUST ON THE POINT OF SETTING WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE WHITE HOUSE THE FOUR ELDER CHILDREN WOULD HAVE LIKED TO LINGER IN THE LANE TILL THE COMPLETE SUNSETTING TURNED THE GROWN UP LAMB WHOSE CHRISTIAN NAMES I WILL NOT FURTHER WEARY YOU BY REPEATING
GO AWAY LITTLE GIRL SAID SAINT MAUR AS WE WILL NOW CALL HIM IN A TERRIBLE VOICE GO HOME AT ONCE YOU'D MUCH BETTER NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM THE NOW RECKLESS ANTHEA WENT ON HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO HE IS HE'S SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU THINK HE IS
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN CYRIL WENT ON IMPATIENTLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS
ANTHEA DETACHED A PIN FROM HER WAISTBAND A PIN WHOSE WITHDRAWAL LEFT A GAPING CHASM BETWEEN SKIRT AND BODICE AND HANDED IT FURTIVELY TO ROBERT WITH A GRIMACE OF THE DARKEST AND DEEPEST MEANING ROBERT SLIPPED AWAY TO THE ROAD
CHAPTER NINE GROWN UP CYRIL HAD ONCE POINTED OUT THAT ORDINARY LIFE IS FULL OF OCCASIONS ON WHICH A WISH WOULD BE MOST USEFUL
YES YOU WILL MY LAMB SAID ANTHEA UNDER HER BREATH BUT IT WON'T BE AT ALL THE SORT OF THING YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IN HER HEART SHE COULD HEAR THE PRETTY SOFT LITTLE LOVING VOICE OF THE BABY LAMB SO DIFFERENT FROM THE AFFECTED TONES OF THE DREADFUL GROWN UP LAMB
THEIR BEDS SPEAKING GLANCES FLASHED BETWEEN THE WRETCHED FOUR MUCH BED THERE WOULD BE FOR THEM IF THEY WENT HOME WITHOUT THE LAMB WE PROMISED MOTHER NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF YOU IF WE TOOK YOU OUT
LOOK HERE JANE SAID THE GROWN UP LAMB
BUT AS SOON AS THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SHONE INTO THE GARDEN HE SAW ALL THE TEN SACKS STANDING SIDE BY SIDE QUITE FULL
THEN HE WAITED TILL HER FATHER CAME HOME AND TOLD HIM THAT THE UNKNOWN MAIDEN
AND THEN PUT ON HER LITTLE GREY FROCK THE THIRD DAY WHEN HER FATHER AND MOTHER AND SISTERS WERE GONE SHE WENT AGAIN INTO THE GARDEN AND SAID SHAKE SHAKE HAZEL TREE GOLD AND SILVER OVER ME
WHEN SUDDENLY HE SAW THREE FISHES COME SWIMMING TOWARDS HIM AND THEY WERE THE VERY FISHES WHOSE LIVES HE HAD SAVED THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE HELD A MUSSEL IN ITS MOUTH WHICH IT LAID ON THE SHORE AT THE YOUTH'S FEET
BUT WAITED TILL HER FATHER CAME HOME AND SAID TO HIM THE UNKNOWN LADY WHO DANCED WITH ME HAS SLIPPED AWAY
THEY WHO WOULD EAT BREAD SHOULD FIRST EARN IT AWAY WITH THE KITCHEN MAID THEN THEY TOOK AWAY HER FINE CLOTHES AND GAVE HER AN OLD GREY FROCK TO PUT ON AND LAUGHED AT HER AND TURNED HER INTO THE KITCHEN THERE
THE FIRST TWIG DEAR FATHER THAT BRUSHES AGAINST YOUR HAT WHEN YOU TURN YOUR FACE TO COME HOMEWARDS SAID SHE THEN HE BOUGHT FOR THE FIRST TWO
YOU WANT TO GO TO THE BALL AND WHEN SHE KEPT ON BEGGING SHE SAID AT LAST TO GET RID OF HER I WILL THROW THIS DISHFUL OF PEAS INTO THE ASH HEAP AND IF IN TWO HOURS TIME YOU HAVE PICKED THEM ALL OUT YOU SHALL GO TO THE FEAST TOO THEN
SHE HAS SPARED NO TROUBLE TO FATTEN HERSELF
NEVER MIND WILL DO BETTER NEXT TIME WHITHER AWAY HANS TO GRETEL MOTHER BEHAVE WELL HANS I'LL BEHAVE WELL GOODBYE MOTHER GOODBYE HANS HANS COMES TO GRETEL
THIS IS NOT THE TRUE BRIDE SAID HE TO THE FATHER HAVE YOU NO OTHER DAUGHTERS NO SAID HE THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE DIRTY ASHPUTTEL HERE THE CHILD OF MY FIRST WIFE I AM SURE SHE CANNOT BE THE BRIDE THE PRINCE TOLD HIM TO SEND HER
HANS COMES TO GRETEL GOOD DAY GRETEL GOOD DAY HANS WHAT DO YOU BRING THAT IS GOOD I BRING NOTHING I WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING GIVEN ME GRETEL PRESENTS HANS WITH A NEEDLE HANS SAYS GOODBYE GRETEL
TO GRETEL MOTHER BEHAVE WELL HANS OH I'LL BEHAVE WELL GOODBYE MOTHER GOODBYE HANS HANS COMES TO GRETEL GOOD DAY GRETEL GOOD DAY HANS WHAT GOOD THING DO YOU BRING I BRING NOTHING I WANT SOMETHING GIVEN ME
IF YOU COME UP AGAIN WITHOUT IT YOU WILL BE THROWN IN AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL YOU PERISH AMID THE WAVES ALL THE PEOPLE GRIEVED FOR THE HANDSOME YOUTH THEN THEY WENT AWAY LEAVING HIM ALONE BY THE SEA HE STOOD ON THE SHORE AND CONSIDERED WHAT HE SHOULD DO
SHE WENT DOWN INTO THE GARDEN AND STREWED WITH HER OWN HANDS TEN SACKSFUL OF MILLET SEED ON THE GRASS THEN SHE SAID
GOODBYE HANS HANS TAKES THE NEEDLE STICKS IT INTO A HAY CART AND FOLLOWS THE CART HOME GOOD EVENING MOTHER GOOD EVENING HANS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN WITH GRETEL WHAT DID YOU TAKE HER
THEN THEY CAME HOPPING UP TO IT SATISFIED THEIR HUNGER AND CRIED WE WILL REMEMBER YOU ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER
HANS COMES TO GRETEL GOOD DAY GRETEL GOOD DAY HANS WHAT GOOD THING DO YOU BRING I BRING NOTHING I WANT SOMETHING GIVEN ME GRETEL PRESENTS HANS WITH A PIECE OF BACON GOODBYE GRETEL GOODBYE HANS
HE SHALL NOT BE MY HUSBAND UNTIL HE HAD BROUGHT ME AN APPLE FROM THE TREE OF LIFE THE YOUTH DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE TREE OF LIFE STOOD BUT HE SET OUT AND WOULD HAVE GONE ON FOR EVER AS LONG AS HIS LEGS WOULD CARRY HIM THOUGH HE HAD NO HOPE OF FINDING IT
AND WHILST THEY WERE MAKING THEIR FEATHERS SMOOTH WITH THEIR BILLS THEY WERE HAVING A CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION TOGETHER THE SERVANT STOOD BY AND LISTENED THEY WERE TELLING ONE ANOTHER OF ALL THE PLACES WHERE THEY HAD BEEN WADDLING ABOUT ALL THE MORNING AND WHAT GOOD FOOD THEY HAD FOUND
AS I WAS EATING IN HASTE I SWALLOWED A RING WHICH LAY UNDER THE QUEEN'S WINDOW THE SERVANT AT ONCE SEIZED HER BY THE NECK CARRIED HER TO THE KITCHEN AND SAID TO THE COOK HERE IS A FINE DUCK PRAY KILL HER YES SAID THE COOK AND WEIGHED HER IN HIS HAND
AND EVEN THE SERVANT DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT NEITHER DID ANYONE KNOW
THIS HAD GONE ON FOR A LONG TIME WHEN ONE DAY THE SERVANT WHO TOOK AWAY THE DISH WAS OVERCOME WITH SUCH CURIOSITY THAT HE COULD NOT HELP CARRYING THE DISH INTO HIS ROOM WHEN HE HAD CAREFULLY LOCKED THE DOOR HE LIFTED UP THE COVER
IN THIS GARDEN STOOD A FINE LARGE PEAR TREE FULL OF RIPE FRUIT AND ASHPUTTEL NOT KNOWING WHERE TO HIDE HERSELF JUMPED UP INTO IT WITHOUT BEING SEEN THEN THE KING'S SON LOST SIGHT OF HER AND COULD NOT FIND OUT WHERE SHE WAS GONE
THE FATHER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF CAN IT BE ASHPUTTEL SO HE HAD AN AXE BROUGHT AND THEY CUT DOWN THE TREE BUT FOUND NO ONE UPON IT AND WHEN THEY CAME BACK INTO THE KITCHEN THERE LAY ASHPUTTEL AMONG THE ASHES
AND HE SAW BY THE BLOOD THAT STREAMED FROM IT WHAT A TRICK SHE HAD PLAYED HIM
AND THE GRATEFUL CREATURES HAD BY GREAT INDUSTRY PICKED UP ALL THE MILLET SEED AND GATHERED THEM INTO THE SACKS PRESENTLY THE KING'S DAUGHTER HERSELF CAME DOWN INTO THE GARDEN AND WAS AMAZED TO SEE THAT THE YOUNG MAN HAD DONE THE TASK SHE HAD GIVEN HIM BUT SHE COULD NOT YET CONQUER HER PROUD HEART AND SAID
WHO WAS ALLOWED TO GO EVERYWHERE THE KING ORDERED THE MAN TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND THREATENED WITH ANGRY WORDS THAT UNLESS HE COULD BEFORE THE MORROW POINT OUT THE THIEF HE HIMSELF SHOULD BE LOOKED UPON AS GUILTY AND EXECUTED IN VAIN HE DECLARED HIS INNOCENCE
BUT HER GREAT TOE COULD NOT GO INTO IT AND THE SHOE WAS ALTOGETHER MUCH TOO SMALL FOR HER THEN THE MOTHER GAVE HER A KNIFE AND SAID NEVER MIND CUT IT OFF WHEN YOU ARE QUEEN YOU WILL NOT CARE ABOUT TOES YOU WILL NOT WANT TO WALK SO THE SILLY GIRL CUT OFF HER GREAT TOE
ABOUT A LITTLE WHEN HIS REQUEST WAS GRANTED HE SET OUT ON HIS WAY AND ONE DAY CAME TO A POND WHERE HE SAW THREE FISHES CAUGHT IN THE REEDS AND GASPING FOR WATER NOW THOUGH IT IS SAID THAT FISHES ARE DUMB
AND THE SNOW FELL AND SPREAD A BEAUTIFUL WHITE COVERING OVER THE GRAVE BUT BY THE TIME THE SPRING CAME AND THE SUN HAD MELTED IT AWAY AGAIN HER FATHER HAD MARRIED ANOTHER WIFE THIS NEW WIFE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS OF HER OWN
YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT A ROPE ROUND THE GOAT'S NECK NEVER MIND WILL DO BETTER NEXT TIME WHITHER AWAY HANS TO GRETEL MOTHER BEHAVE WELL HANS OH I'LL BEHAVE WELL GOODBYE MOTHER GOODBYE HANS
AND WHEN HE HAD WALKED A LONG WAY HE CAME TO A LARGE CITY THERE WAS A GREAT NOISE AND CROWD IN THE STREETS AND A MAN RODE UP ON HORSEBACK CRYING ALOUD THE KING'S DAUGHTER WANTS A HUSBAND BUT WHOEVER SEEKS HER HAND MUST PERFORM A HARD TASK
AND SAT DOWN UNDER THE HAZEL TREE AND CRIED OUT SHAKE SHAKE HAZEL TREE GOLD AND SILVER OVER ME THEN HER FRIEND THE BIRD FLEW OUT OF THE TREE AND BROUGHT A GOLD AND SILVER DRESS FOR HER AND SLIPPERS OF SPANGLED SILK AND SHE PUT THEM ON AND FOLLOWED HER SISTERS TO THE FEAST
FLAPPING THEIR WINGS AND CRYING OH WHAT HELPLESS CHICKS WE ARE WE MUST SHIFT FOR OURSELVES AND YET WE CANNOT FLY WHAT CAN WE DO BUT LIE HERE AND STARVE SO THE GOOD YOUNG FELLOW ALIGHTED AND KILLED HIS HORSE WITH HIS SWORD AND GAVE IT TO THEM FOR FOOD
THAT SHE BROUGHT HOME WITH HER THEY WERE FAIR IN FACE BUT FOUL AT HEART AND IT WAS NOW A SORRY TIME FOR THE POOR LITTLE GIRL WHAT DOES THE GOOD FOR NOTHING WANT IN THE PARLOUR SAID THEY
IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE WAS TIRED SHE HAD NO BED TO LIE DOWN ON BUT WAS MADE TO LIE BY THE HEARTH AMONG THE ASHES AND AS THIS OF COURSE MADE HER ALWAYS DUSTY AND DIRTY THEY CALLED HER ASHPUTTEL
BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HER AND THOUGHT IT MUST BE SOME STRANGE PRINCESS SHE LOOKED SO FINE AND BEAUTIFUL IN HER RICH CLOTHES AND THEY NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF ASHPUTTEL TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT SHE WAS SAFE AT HOME IN THE DIRT THE KING'S SON SOON CAME UP TO HER
SHE WAS FORCED TO DO HARD WORK TO RISE EARLY BEFORE DAYLIGHT TO BRING THE WATER TO MAKE THE FIRE TO COOK AND TO WASH BESIDES THAT THE SISTERS PLAGUED HER IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS AND LAUGHED AT HER
ALLOWED HIM TO ASK A FAVOUR AND PROMISED HIM THE BEST PLACE IN THE COURT THAT HE COULD WISH FOR THE SERVANT REFUSED EVERYTHING AND ONLY ASKED FOR A HORSE AND SOME MONEY FOR TRAVELLING
AND I WILL LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND WATCH OVER YOU SOON AFTERWARDS SHE SHUT HER EYES AND DIED AND WAS BURIED IN THE GARDEN AND THE LITTLE GIRL WENT EVERY DAY TO HER GRAVE AND WEPT AND WAS ALWAYS GOOD AND KIND TO ALL ABOUT HER
GOOD DAY HANS WHAT GOOD THING DO YOU BRING I BRING NOTHING BUT WOULD HAVE SOMETHING GIVEN GRETEL SAYS TO HANS I WILL GO WITH YOU HANS TAKES GRETEL TIES HER TO A ROPE LEADS HER TO THE RACK AND BINDS HER FAST THEN HANS GOES TO HIS MOTHER
AND HE SET HER AS HIS BRIDE BY HIS SIDE ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY WITH HER BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THE HAZEL TREE THE LITTLE DOVE SAT THERE STILL AND SANG BACK AGAIN BACK AGAIN LOOK TO THE SHOE THE SHOE IS TOO SMALL AND NOT MADE FOR YOU
WAS BROUGHT TO HIM THROUGH THE AIR BUT HE HAD A STRANGE CUSTOM EVERY DAY AFTER DINNER WHEN THE TABLE WAS CLEARED AND NO ONE ELSE WAS PRESENT A TRUSTY SERVANT HAD TO BRING HIM ONE MORE DISH IT WAS COVERED HOWEVER
HANS WENT INTO THE STABLE CUT OUT ALL THE CALVES AND SHEEP'S EYES AND THREW THEM IN GRETEL'S FACE
WITH GRETEL WHAT DID YOU TAKE HER TOOK NOTHING SHE GAVE ME SOMETHING WHAT DID GRETEL GIVE YOU SHE GAVE ME A GOAT WHERE IS THE GOAT HANS PUT IT IN MY POCKET THAT WAS ILL DONE HANS
NEVER MIND I'LL DO BETTER NEXT TIME WHITHER AWAY HANS TO GRETEL MOTHER BEHAVE WELL HANS OH I'LL BEHAVE WELL GOODBYE MOTHER GOODBYE HANS HANS COMES TO GRETEL
WENT BEFORE THE KING AND DECLARED HIMSELF A SUITOR SO HE WAS LED OUT TO THE SEA AND A GOLD RING WAS THROWN INTO IT BEFORE HIS EYES THEN THE KING ORDERED HIM TO FETCH THIS RING UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AND ADDED
TOOK NOTHING HAD SOMETHING GIVEN ME WHAT DID GRETEL GIVE YOU GAVE ME A NEEDLE WHERE IS THE NEEDLE HANS STUCK IN THE HAY CART THAT WAS ILL DONE HANS
CHIRPING AND FLUTTERING IN AND THEY FLEW DOWN INTO THE ASHES AND THE LITTLE DOVES STOOPED THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SET TO WORK PICK PICK PICK AND THEN THE OTHERS BEGAN TO PICK PICK PICK
GOOD DAY GRETEL GOOD DAY HANS WHAT GOOD THING DO YOU BRING I BRING NOTHING BUT WOULD HAVE SOMETHING GIVEN GRETEL PRESENTS HANS WITH A CALF GOODBYE GRETEL GOODBYE HANS HANS TAKES THE CALF
AND THUS SQUEEZED ON THE SHOE AND WENT TO THE KING'S SON THEN HE TOOK HER FOR HIS BRIDE AND SET HER BESIDE HIM ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY WITH HER HOMEWARDS BUT ON THEIR WAY HOME
THEN BOTH THE SISTERS WERE OVERJOYED TO HEAR IT FOR THEY HAD BEAUTIFUL FEET AND HAD NO DOUBT THAT THEY COULD WEAR THE GOLDEN SLIPPER THE ELDEST WENT FIRST INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE SLIPPER WAS AND WANTED TO TRY IT ON AND THE MOTHER STOOD BY
GOOD EVENING MOTHER GOOD EVENING HANS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN WITH GRETEL WHAT DID YOU TAKE HER I TOOK HER NOTHING WHAT DID GRETEL GIVE YOU SHE GAVE ME NOTHING SHE CAME WITH ME WHERE HAVE YOU LEFT GRETEL
CLEVER HANS THE MOTHER OF HANS SAID WHITHER AWAY HANS HANS ANSWERED TO GRETEL BEHAVE WELL HANS OH I'LL BEHAVE WELL GOODBYE MOTHER GOODBYE HANS
BUT THE MOTHER SAID NO NO SHE IS MUCH TOO DIRTY SHE WILL NOT DARE TO SHOW HERSELF HOWEVER THE PRINCE WOULD HAVE HER COME AND SHE FIRST WASHED HER FACE AND HANDS AND THEN WENT IN AND CURTSIED TO HIM AND HE REACHED HER THE GOLDEN SLIPPER THEN SHE TOOK HER CLUMSY SHOE OFF HER LEFT FOOT
AND SAW A WHITE SNAKE LYING ON THE DISH BUT WHEN HE SAW IT HE COULD NOT DENY HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF TASTING IT SO HE CUT OF A LITTLE BIT AND PUT IT INTO HIS MOUTH NO SOONER HAD IT TOUCHED HIS TONGUE
AND ON HIS WAY HOME AS HE RODE THROUGH A GREEN COPSE A HAZEL TWIG BRUSHED AGAINST HIM AND ALMOST PUSHED OFF HIS HAT SO HE BROKE IT OFF AND BROUGHT IT AWAY AND WHEN HE GOT HOME HE GAVE IT TO HIS DAUGHTER THEN SHE TOOK IT
AND CORINTHIAN AND PELOPONNESIAN CITIZENS WITHIN IT WERE BEING BESIEGED THAT OF ATHENS AGAINST THE PELOPONNESIANS THAT THEY HAD INCITED A TOWN OF HERS A MEMBER OF HER ALLIANCE AND A CONTRIBUTOR TO HER REVENUE TO REVOLT
FAR FROM PERMITTING MYSELF TO DERIVE IT FROM THE FIRST SOURCE THAT CAME TO HAND I DID NOT EVEN TRUST MY OWN IMPRESSIONS BUT IT RESTS PARTLY ON WHAT I SAW MYSELF PARTLY ON WHAT OTHERS SAW FOR ME THE ACCURACY OF THE REPORT BEING ALWAYS TRIED BY THE MOST SEVERE AND DETAILED TESTS POSSIBLE
EITHER IN WAR OR IN OTHER MATTERS FOR INSTANCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE COUNTRY NOW CALLED HELLAS HAD IN ANCIENT TIMES NO SETTLED POPULATION ON THE CONTRARY MIGRATIONS WERE OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE
PARTICULARLY IF THAT POWER ASPIRES TO THE GLORY OF BEING THE LIBERATOR OF HELLAS WE ARE AT LAST ASSEMBLED IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY TO ASSEMBLE NOR EVEN NOW ARE OUR OBJECTS DEFINED
AGAIN WHEREVER THERE WERE TYRANTS THEIR HABIT OF PROVIDING SIMPLY FOR THEMSELVES OF LOOKING SOLELY TO THEIR PERSONAL COMFORT AND FAMILY AGGRANDIZEMENT MADE SAFETY THE GREAT AIM OF THEIR POLICY AND PREVENTED ANYTHING GREAT PROCEEDING FROM THEM
YOU STILL DELAY AND FAIL TO SEE THAT PEACE STAYS LONGEST WITH THOSE WHO ARE NOT MORE CAREFUL TO USE THEIR POWER JUSTLY THAN TO SHOW THEIR DETERMINATION NOT TO SUBMIT TO INJUSTICE ON THE CONTRARY
AGAINST ATHENS YOU PREFER TO ACT ON THE DEFENSIVE INSTEAD OF ON THE OFFENSIVE
IN DEALING WITH FOREIGN POLITICS TIME AFTER TIME WAS OUR VOICE RAISED TO WARN YOU OF THE BLOWS ABOUT TO BE DEALT US BY ATHENS AND TIME AFTER TIME INSTEAD OF TAKING THE TROUBLE TO ASCERTAIN THE WORTH OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS
WHEREAS IF ATHENS WERE TO SUFFER THE SAME MISFORTUNE I SUPPOSE THAT ANY INFERENCE FROM THE APPEARANCE PRESENTED TO THE EYE
OR WITH ITS OWN REVOLTED ALLIES AND CONSEQUENTLY AFFORDED THEM CONSTANT PRACTICE IN MILITARY MATTERS AND THAT EXPERIENCE WHICH IS LEARNT IN THE SCHOOL OF DANGER
IT ALSO INVITED INVASION ACCORDINGLY ATTICA FROM THE POVERTY OF ITS SOIL ENJOYING FROM A VERY REMOTE PERIOD FREEDOM FROM FACTION NEVER CHANGED ITS INHABITANTS
AND HERE IS NO INCONSIDERABLE EXEMPLIFICATION OF MY ASSERTION THAT THE MIGRATIONS WERE THE CAUSE OF THERE BEING NO CORRESPONDENT GROWTH IN OTHER PARTS THE MOST POWERFUL VICTIMS OF WAR OR FACTION
THEY WOULD HAVE EASILY DEFEATED THE TROJANS IN THE FIELD SINCE THEY COULD HOLD THEIR OWN AGAINST THEM WITH THE DIVISION ON SERVICE IN SHORT IF THEY HAD STUCK TO THE SIEGE
AND DEFEND YOURSELVES NOT BY DOING ANYTHING BUT BY LOOKING AS IF YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING YOU ALONE WAIT TILL THE POWER OF AN ENEMY IS BECOMING TWICE ITS ORIGINAL SIZE INSTEAD OF CRUSHING IT IN ITS INFANCY AND YET THE WORLD USED TO SAY
ONCE AND FOR ALL PUT DOWN BY LACEDAEMON FOR THIS CITY THOUGH AFTER THE SETTLEMENT OF THE DORIANS ITS PRESENT INHABITANTS IT SUFFERED FROM FACTIONS FOR AN UNPARALLELED LENGTH OF TIME STILL AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD OBTAINED GOOD LAWS
A FASHION WHICH SPREAD TO THEIR IONIAN KINDRED AND LONG PREVAILED AMONG THE OLD MEN THERE
IN THE LAST STATE OF PERFECTION AND HE COULD SEE THE REST OF THE HELLENIC RACE TAKING SIDES IN THE QUARREL THOSE WHO DELAYED DOING SO AT ONCE HAVING IT IN CONTEMPLATION INDEED THIS WAS THE GREATEST MOVEMENT YET KNOWN IN HISTORY
MOST OF THE PELOPONNESE ARCADIA EXCEPTED AND THE MOST FERTILE PARTS OF THE REST OF HELLAS THE GOODNESS OF THE LAND FAVOURED THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS AND THUS CREATED FACTION WHICH PROVED A FERTILE SOURCE OF RUIN
KINGS HAVE TWO VOTES EACH THE FACT BEING THAT THEY HAVE ONLY ONE
NOT MANY YEARS AFTER THE DEPOSITION OF THE TYRANTS THE BATTLE OF MARATHON WAS FOUGHT BETWEEN THE MEDES AND THE ATHENIANS TEN YEARS AFTERWARDS THE BARBARIAN RETURNED WITH THE ARMADA FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF HELLAS
WHAT ENABLED AGAMEMNON TO RAISE THE ARMAMENT WAS MORE IN MY OPINION HIS SUPERIORITY IN STRENGTH THAN THE OATHS OF TYNDAREUS WHICH BOUND THE SUITORS TO FOLLOW HIM
AND THE CORINTHIAN TERRITORY WAS THE HIGHWAY THROUGH WHICH IT TRAVELLED SHE HAD CONSEQUENTLY GREAT MONEY RESOURCES AS IS SHOWN BY THE EPITHET WEALTHY BESTOWED BY THE OLD POETS ON THE PLACE AND THIS ENABLED HER WHEN TRAFFIC BY SEA BECAME MORE COMMON
SO LITTLE PAINS DO THE VULGAR TAKE IN THE INVESTIGATION OF TRUTH ACCEPTING READILY THE FIRST STORY THAT COMES TO HAND ON THE WHOLE HOWEVER THE CONCLUSIONS I HAVE DRAWN FROM THE PROOFS QUOTED MAY I BELIEVE SAFELY BE RELIED ON
WHICH ALL THE MEN AT THE OAR ARE BOWMEN NOW IT IS IMPROBABLE THAT MANY SUPERNUMERARIES SAILED IF WE EXCEPT THE KINGS AND HIGH OFFICERS ESPECIALLY AS THEY HAD TO CROSS THE OPEN SEA WITH MUNITIONS OF WAR IN SHIPS
ON OTHER BUSINESS ON HEARING THE SPEECHES THEY THOUGHT THEMSELVES CALLED UPON TO COME BEFORE THE LACEDAEMONIANS
WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN OBSCURED BY TIME FOR INSTANCE
DATING FROM THE SAME TIME PLANTED ON AN ISTHMUS CORINTH HAD FROM TIME OUT OF MIND BEEN A COMMERCIAL EMPORIUM AS FORMERLY ALMOST ALL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE HELLENES WITHIN AND WITHOUT PELOPONNESE WAS CARRIED ON OVERLAND
THEY SEEM TO HAVE TURNED TO CULTIVATION OF THE CHERSONESE AND TO PIRACY FROM WANT OF SUPPLIES THIS WAS WHAT REALLY ENABLED THE TROJANS TO KEEP THE FIELD FOR TEN YEARS AGAINST THEM THE DISPERSION OF THE ENEMY MAKING THEM ALWAYS A MATCH FOR THE DETACHMENT LEFT BEHIND
HERE BY THE PARTIES CONTENDING THE OLD INHABITANTS BEING SOMETIMES REMOVED TO MAKE ROOM FOR OTHERS NEVER WAS THERE SO MUCH BANISHING AND BLOOD SHEDDING NOW ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE NOW IN THE STRIFE OF FACTION
AND TO REFRESH THE MEMORY OF THE OLD AND ENLIGHTEN THE IGNORANCE OF THE YOUNG FROM A NOTION THAT THEIR WORDS MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF INDUCING THEM TO PREFER TRANQUILLITY TO WAR
AND WHEN FORCED TO ACT YOU NEVER GO FAR ENOUGH AGAIN THEY ARE ADVENTUROUS BEYOND THEIR POWER AND DARING BEYOND THEIR JUDGMENT AND IN DANGER THEY ARE SANGUINE YOUR WONT IS TO ATTEMPT LESS THAN IS JUSTIFIED BY YOUR POWER
AND IT WAS AT A SOMEWHAT LATER STAGE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT
THE ACARNANIANS AND THAT REGION OF THE CONTINENT AND THE CUSTOM OF CARRYING ARMS IS STILL KEPT UP AMONG THESE CONTINENTALS FROM THE OLD PIRATICAL HABITS THE WHOLE OF HELLAS USED ONCE TO CARRY ARMS THEIR HABITATIONS BEING UNPROTECTED
AND THE FIRST PERSON KNOWN TO US BY TRADITION AS HAVING ESTABLISHED A NAVY IS MINOS HE MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF WHAT IS NOW CALLED THE HELLENIC SEA AND RULED OVER THE CYCLADES INTO MOST OF WHICH
TO THIS DAY AMONG SOME OF THE BARBARIANS ESPECIALLY IN ASIA WHEN PRIZES FOR BOXING AND WRESTLING ARE OFFERED BELTS ARE WORN BY THE COMBATANTS AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER POINTS IN WHICH A LIKENESS MIGHT BE SHOWN BETWEEN THE LIFE OF THE HELLENIC WORLD OF OLD AND THE BARBARIAN OF TO DAY
A DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE SHE MAY FEEL FROM THE IDEA THAT YOUR BLUNTNESS OF PERCEPTION PREVENTS YOUR NOTICING HER BUT IT IS NOTHING TO THE IMPULSE WHICH HER ADVANCE WILL RECEIVE FROM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SEE BUT DO NOT CARE TO INTERFERE
OR OF ANY VIGOROUS ACTION OF THEIR OWN BUT AT LAST A TIME CAME WHEN THE TYRANTS OF ATHENS AND THE FAR OLDER TYRANNIES OF THE REST OF HELLAS WERE
IT WAS QUITE AT THE END OF THIS PERIOD THAT THE WAR WITH AEGINA AND THE PROSPECT OF THE BARBARIAN INVASION ENABLED THEMISTOCLES TO PERSUADE THE ATHENIANS TO BUILD THE FLEET WITH WHICH THEY FOUGHT AT SALAMIS
IN FINE I HAVE WRITTEN MY WORK NOT AS AN ESSAY WHICH IS TO WIN THE APPLAUSE OF THE MOMENT BUT AS A POSSESSION FOR ALL TIME THE MEDIAN WAR THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT OF PAST TIMES YET FOUND A SPEEDY DECISION IN TWO ACTIONS BY SEA AND TWO BY LAND
AND ENJOYED A FREEDOM FROM TYRANTS WHICH WAS UNBROKEN IT HAS POSSESSED THE SAME FORM OF GOVERNMENT FOR MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS RECKONING TO THE END OF THE LATE WAR AND HAS THUS BEEN IN A POSITION TO ARRANGE THE AFFAIRS OF THE OTHER STATES
AND EVEN AT THE PRESENT DAY MANY OF HELLAS STILL FOLLOW THE OLD FASHION THE OZOLIAN
AND HAD COME AND WERE OPENLY FIGHTING AGAINST HER ON THE SIDE OF THE POTIDAEANS FOR ALL THIS WAR HAD NOT YET BROKEN OUT THERE WAS STILL TRUCE FOR A WHILE FOR THIS WAS A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE ON THE PART OF CORINTH
VARIOUS TOO WERE THE OBSTACLES WHICH THE NATIONAL GROWTH ENCOUNTERED IN VARIOUS LOCALITIES THE POWER OF THE IONIANS WAS ADVANCING WITH RAPID STRIDES WHEN IT CAME INTO COLLISION WITH PERSIA UNDER KING CYRUS WHO AFTER HAVING DETHRONED CROESUS
SHE CAME AND LOUDLY ACCUSED ATHENS OF BREACH OF THE TREATY AND AGGRESSION ON THE RIGHTS OF PELOPONNESE WITH HER THE AEGINETANS FORMALLY UNREPRESENTED FROM FEAR OF ATHENS IN SECRET PROVED NOT THE LEAST URGENT OF THE ADVOCATES FOR WAR
WERE CARIANS THEY WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE FASHION OF THE ARMS BURIED WITH THEM AND BY THE METHOD OF INTERMENT WHICH WAS THE SAME AS THE CARIANS STILL FOLLOW BUT AS SOON AS MINOS HAD FORMED HIS NAVY COMMUNICATION BY SEA BECAME EASIER
SUCH WERE THE WORDS OF THE CORINTHIANS
THE SEVERAL TRIBES READILY ABANDONING THEIR HOMES UNDER THE PRESSURE OF SUPERIOR NUMBERS WITHOUT COMMERCE WITHOUT FREEDOM OF COMMUNICATION EITHER BY LAND OR SEA CULTIVATING NO MORE OF THEIR TERRITORY THAN THE EXIGENCIES OF LIFE REQUIRED
BY THIS I CONCEIVE HE MEANT TO CONVEY THE MAXIMUM AND THE MINIMUM COMPLEMENT AT ANY RATE HE DOES NOT SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF ANY OTHERS IN HIS CATALOGUE OF THE SHIPS THAT THEY WERE ALL ROWERS
SOME EVEN BEGAN TO BUILD THEMSELVES WALLS ON THE STRENGTH OF THEIR NEWLY ACQUIRED RICHES FOR THE LOVE OF GAIN WOULD RECONCILE THE WEAKER TO THE DOMINION OF THE STRONGER AND THE POSSESSION OF CAPITAL ENABLED THE MORE POWERFUL TO REDUCE THE SMALLER TOWNS TO SUBJECTION
BORN LONG AFTER THE TROJAN WAR HE NOWHERE CALLS ALL OF THEM BY THAT NAME NOR INDEED ANY OF THEM EXCEPT THE FOLLOWERS OF ACHILLES FROM PHTHIOTIS WHO WERE THE ORIGINAL HELLENES
THREW THEMSELVES INTO THEIR SHIPS AND BECAME A NAVAL PEOPLE THIS COALITION AFTER REPULSING THE BARBARIAN SOON AFTERWARDS SPLIT INTO TWO SECTIONS WHICH INCLUDED THE HELLENES WHO HAD REVOLTED FROM THE KING AS WELL AS THOSE WHO HAD AIDED HIM IN THE WAR
TO PROCURE HER NAVY AND PUT DOWN PIRACY AND AS SHE COULD OFFER A MART FOR BOTH BRANCHES OF THE TRADE SHE ACQUIRED FOR HERSELF ALL THE POWER WHICH A LARGE REVENUE AFFORDS
AND WERE INVITED AS ALLIES INTO THE OTHER CITIES THAT ONE BY ONE THEY GRADUALLY ACQUIRED FROM THE CONNECTION THE NAME OF HELLENES
FOR THEY HOPE BY THEIR ABSENCE TO EXTEND THEIR ACQUISITIONS YOU FEAR BY YOUR ADVANCE TO ENDANGER WHAT YOU HAVE LEFT BEHIND THEY ARE SWIFT TO FOLLOW UP A SUCCESS AND SLOW TO RECOIL FROM A REVERSE THEIR BODIES THEY SPEND UNGRUDGINGLY IN THEIR COUNTRY'S CAUSE
THEY WERE THE MEANS BY WHICH THE ISLANDS WERE REACHED AND REDUCED THOSE OF THE SMALLEST AREA FALLING THE EASIEST PREY WARS BY LAND THERE WERE NONE NONE AT LEAST BY WHICH POWER WAS ACQUIRED
ALLIES AMONG WHOM WE HAVE NOT THE WORST TITLE TO SPEAK AS HAVING THE GREATEST COMPLAINTS TO MAKE COMPLAINTS OF ATHENIAN OUTRAGE AND LACEDAEMONIAN NEGLECT NOW IF THESE ASSAULTS ON THE RIGHTS OF HELLAS HAD BEEN MADE IN THE DARK
AND SO THE POWER OF THE DESCENDANTS OF PELOPS CAME TO BE GREATER THAN THAT OF THE DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS
AND LEAD THE WHOLE NOT TO SPEAK OF THEIR NUMEROUS ALLIES WITHOUT STILL AS THE CITY IS NEITHER BUILT IN A COMPACT FORM NOR ADORNED WITH MAGNIFICENT TEMPLES AND PUBLIC EDIFICES BUT COMPOSED OF VILLAGES AFTER THE OLD FASHION OF HELLAS
HE HAS REPRESENTED IT AS CONSISTING OF TWELVE HUNDRED VESSELS THE BOEOTIAN COMPLEMENT OF EACH SHIP BEING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MEN
THERE WERE GREAT DROUGHTS IN SUNDRY PLACES AND CONSEQUENT FAMINES AND THAT MOST CALAMITOUS AND AWFULLY FATAL VISITATION THE PLAGUE ALL THIS CAME UPON THEM WITH THE LATE WAR WHICH WAS BEGUN BY THE ATHENIANS AND PELOPONNESIANS
AND THAT OF THE ARCADIANS WAS FURNISHED BY HIM THIS AT LEAST IS WHAT HOMER SAYS IF HIS TESTIMONY IS DEEMED SUFFICIENT BESIDES IN HIS ACCOUNT OF THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SCEPTRE
IN THE ONE CASE THE ABASEMENT LEADS TO GAINING ADHERENTS IN THE OTHER CASE TO PROCURING FAVOUR
I WILL TAKE NO TROUBLE ABOUT IT AND THE PEOPLE WILL OF THEMSELVES BECOME RICH I WILL MANIFEST NO AMBITION AND THE PEOPLE WILL OF THEMSELVES ATTAIN TO THE PRIMITIVE SIMPLICITY
THE GREAT STATE ONLY WISHES TO UNITE MEN TOGETHER AND NOURISH THEM A SMALL STATE ONLY WISHES TO BE RECEIVED BY AND TO SERVE THE OTHER EACH GETS WHAT IT DESIRES BUT THE GREAT STATE MUST LEARN TO ABASE ITSELF
THEREFORE THE SAGE IS LIKE A SQUARE WHICH CUTS NO ONE WITH ITS ANGLES LIKE A CORNER WHICH INJURES NO ONE WITH ITS SHARPNESS HE IS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT ALLOWS HIMSELF NO LICENSE HE IS BRIGHT BUT DOES NOT DAZZLE
WHO KNOWS HIS MANHOOD'S STRENGTH YET STILL HIS FEMALE FEEBLENESS MAINTAINS AS TO ONE CHANNEL FLOW THE MANY DRAINS ALL COME TO HIM YEA ALL BENEATH THE SKY THUS HE THE CONSTANT EXCELLENCE RETAINS
AND THAT AS THE PRECURSOR OF THE TEAM OF HORSES IN THE COURT YARD SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD NOT BE EQUAL TO A LESSON OF THIS TAO WHICH ONE MIGHT PRESENT ON HIS KNEES
ALL PERVADING IS THE GREAT TAO IT MAY BE FOUND ON THE LEFT HAND AND ON THE RIGHT
AND MAKES NO ASSUMPTION OF BEING THEIR LORD IT MAY BE NAMED IN THE SMALLEST THINGS ALL THINGS RETURN TO THEIR ROOT AND DISAPPEAR AND DO NOT KNOW THAT IT IS IT WHICH PRESIDES OVER THEIR DOING SO IT MAY BE NAMED IN THE GREATEST THINGS
THEREFORE A SAGE HAS SAID I WILL DO NOTHING OF PURPOSE AND THE PEOPLE WILL BE TRANSFORMED OF THEMSELVES I WILL BE FOND OF KEEPING STILL AND THE PEOPLE WILL OF THEMSELVES BECOME CORRECT
IF WE COULD RENOUNCE OUR SAGENESS AND DISCARD OUR WISDOM IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE A HUNDREDFOLD IF WE COULD RENOUNCE OUR BENEVOLENCE AND DISCARD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS THE PEOPLE WOULD AGAIN BECOME FILIAL AND KINDLY
IN THE SAME WAY THE SAGE IS ALWAYS SKILFUL AT SAVING MEN AND SO HE DOES NOT CAST AWAY ANY MAN HE IS ALWAYS SKILFUL AT SAVING THINGS AND SO HE DOES NOT CAST AWAY ANYTHING THIS IS CALLED HIDING THE LIGHT OF HIS PROCEDURE
WHAT SPACE THE GULF BETWEEN SHALL FILL WHAT ALL MEN FEAR IS INDEED TO BE FEARED BUT HOW WIDE AND WITHOUT END IS THE RANGE OF QUESTIONS ASKING TO BE DISCUSSED
HENCE THOSE WITH WHOM HE AGREES AS TO THE TAO HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF ATTAINING TO IT THOSE WITH WHOM HE AGREES AS TO ITS MANIFESTATION HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF ATTAINING TO IT AND THOSE WITH WHOM HE AGREES IN THEIR FAILURE
THE MORE ACTS OF CRAFTY DEXTERITY THAT MEN POSSESS THE MORE DO STRANGE CONTRIVANCES APPEAR THE MORE DISPLAY THERE IS OF LEGISLATION THE MORE THIEVES AND ROBBERS THERE ARE
HE MAY BE THE RULER OF A STATE
WOULD BE TO DELIGHT IN THE SLAUGHTER OF MEN AND HE WHO DELIGHTS IN THE SLAUGHTER OF MEN CANNOT GET HIS WILL IN THE KINGDOM
THE PARTIAL BECOMES COMPLETE THE CROOKED STRAIGHT THE EMPTY FULL THE WORN OUT NEW HE WHOSE DESIRES ARE FEW GETS THEM HE WHOSE DESIRES ARE MANY GOES ASTRAY
THE SUPERIOR MAN ORDINARILY CONSIDERS THE LEFT HAND THE MOST HONOURABLE PLACE BUT IN TIME OF WAR THE RIGHT HAND THOSE SHARP WEAPONS ARE INSTRUMENTS OF EVIL OMEN AND NOT THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE SUPERIOR MAN
THE UNWROUGHT MATERIAL WHEN DIVIDED AND DISTRIBUTED FORMS VESSELS THE SAGE WHEN EMPLOYED BECOMES THE HEAD OF ALL THE OFFICERS OF GOVERNMENT AND IN HIS GREATEST REGULATIONS HE EMPLOYS NO VIOLENT MEASURES
WHEN THINGS HAVE BECOME STRONG THEY THEN BECOME OLD WHICH MAY BE SAID TO BE CONTRARY TO THE TAO WHATEVER IS CONTRARY TO THE TAO SOON ENDS
THE SOFT OVERCOMES THE HARD AND THE WEAK THE STRONG
ITS NAME WHAT PASSES NOT AWAY SO IN THEIR BEAUTIFUL ARRAY THINGS FORM AND NEVER KNOW DECAY HOW KNOW I THAT IT IS SO WITH ALL THE BEAUTIES OF EXISTING THINGS BY THIS NATURE OF THE TAO
TO HIM BY WHOM THIS HARMONY IS KNOWN THE SECRET OF THE UNCHANGING TAO IS SHOWN AND IN THE KNOWLEDGE WISDOM FINDS ITS THRONE ALL LIFE INCREASING ARTS TO EVIL TURN
PROFOUND IT IS DARK AND OBSCURE THINGS ESSENCES ALL THERE ENDURE THOSE ESSENCES THE TRUTH ENFOLD OF WHAT WHEN SEEN SHALL THEN BE TOLD NOW IT IS SO TWAS SO OF OLD
GRAVITY IS THE ROOT OF LIGHTNESS STILLNESS THE RULER OF MOVEMENT
WHEREVER A HOST IS STATIONED BRIARS AND THORNS SPRING UP IN THE SEQUENCE OF GREAT ARMIES THERE ARE SURE TO BE BAD YEARS
A SKILFUL COMMANDER STRIKES A DECISIVE BLOW AND STOPS HE DOES NOT DARE BY CONTINUING HIS OPERATIONS TO ASSERT AND COMPLETE HIS MASTERY HE WILL STRIKE THE BLOW
THAT SAYING OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE PARTIAL BECOMES COMPLETE WAS NOT VAINLY SPOKEN ALL REAL COMPLETION IS COMPREHENDED UNDER IT
MUSIC AND DAINTIES WILL MAKE THE PASSING GUEST STOP FOR A TIME BUT THOUGH THE TAO AS IT COMES FROM THE MOUTH SEEMS INSIPID AND HAS NO FLAVOUR THOUGH IT SEEMS NOT WORTH BEING LOOKED AT OR LISTENED TO
SHOWING THE PERFECTION OF ITS PHYSICAL ESSENCE ALL DAY LONG IT WILL CRY WITHOUT ITS THROAT BECOMING HOARSE SHOWING THE HARMONY IN ITS CONSTITUTION
HE WHO KNOWS THE TAO DOES NOT CARE TO SPEAK ABOUT IT HE WHO IS EVER READY TO SPEAK ABOUT IT DOES NOT KNOW IT
HE WHO LIGHTLY PROMISES IS SURE TO KEEP BUT LITTLE FAITH HE WHO IS CONTINUALLY THINKING THINGS EASY IS SURE TO FIND THEM DIFFICULT
WHEN WE RENOUNCE LEARNING WE HAVE NO TROUBLES THE READY YES AND FLATTERING YEA SMALL IS THE DIFFERENCE THEY DISPLAY BUT MARK THEIR ISSUES GOOD AND ILL
THE RELATION OF THE TAO TO ALL THE WORLD IS LIKE THAT OF THE GREAT RIVERS AND SEAS TO THE STREAMS FROM THE VALLEYS
WHAT MAKES A GREAT STATE IS ITS BEING LIKE A LOW LYING DOWN FLOWING STREAM IT BECOMES THE CENTRE TO WHICH TEND ALL THE SMALL STATES UNDER HEAVEN
BUT I VALUE THE NURSING MOTHER THE TAO
AND TO RECOMPENSE INJURY WITH KINDNESS
HIS PLACE THAT IS IS ASSIGNED TO HIM AS IN THE RITES OF MOURNING HE WHO HAS KILLED MULTITUDES OF MEN SHOULD WEEP FOR THEM WITH THE BITTEREST GRIEF AND THE VICTOR IN BATTLE HAS HIS PLACE RIGHTLY ACCORDING TO THOSE RITES
IT IS THE WAY OF THE TAO TO ACT WITHOUT THINKING OF ACTING TO CONDUCT AFFAIRS WITHOUT FEELING THE TROUBLE OF THEM TO TASTE WITHOUT DISCERNING ANY FLAVOUR TO CONSIDER WHAT IS SMALL AS GREAT AND A FEW AS MANY
THEREFORE A WISE PRINCE MARCHING THE WHOLE DAY DOES NOT GO FAR FROM HIS BAGGAGE WAGGONS ALTHOUGH HE MAY HAVE BRILLIANT PROSPECTS TO LOOK AT HE QUIETLY REMAINS IN HIS PROPER PLACE INDIFFERENT TO THEM
MAKING AN EFFORT FURTHER TO GIVE IT A NAME I CALL IT THE GREAT
HE WHO HAS IN HIMSELF ABUNDANTLY THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE TAO IS LIKE AN INFANT POISONOUS INSECTS WILL NOT STING HIM FIERCE BEASTS WILL NOT SEIZE HIM BIRDS OF PREY WILL NOT STRIKE HIM
IF THIS TRANSFORMATION BECAME TO ME AN OBJECT OF DESIRE I WOULD EXPRESS THE DESIRE BY THE NAMELESS SIMPLICITY SIMPLICITY WITHOUT A NAME IS FREE FROM ALL EXTERNAL AIM
THEREFORE WHEN THE SOVEREIGN OCCUPIES HIS PLACE AS THE SON OF HEAVEN AND HE HAS APPOINTED HIS THREE DUCAL MINISTERS
DRIFTING AS IF I HAD NOWHERE TO REST ALL MEN HAVE THEIR SPHERES OF ACTION WHILE I ALONE SEEM DULL AND INCAPABLE LIKE A RUDE BORDERER THUS I ALONE AM DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MEN
HE WHO VAUNTS HIMSELF DOES NOT FIND HIS MERIT ACKNOWLEDGED HE WHO IS SELF CONCEITED HAS NO SUPERIORITY ALLOWED TO HIM SUCH CONDITIONS VIEWED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE TAO
THEREFORE THE SAGE HOLDS IN HIS EMBRACE THE ONE THING OF HUMILITY AND MANIFESTS IT TO ALL THE WORLD HE IS FREE FROM SELF DISPLAY AND THEREFORE HE SHINES FROM SELF ASSERTION AND THEREFORE HE IS DISTINGUISHED
ELUDING SIGHT ELUDING TOUCH THE FORMS OF THINGS ALL IN IT CROUCH ELUDING TOUCH ELUDING SIGHT THERE ARE THEIR SEMBLANCES ALL RIGHT
THE MULTITUDE OF MEN ALL HAVE ENOUGH AND TO SPARE I ALONE SEEM TO HAVE LOST EVERYTHING MY MIND IS THAT OF A STUPID MAN I AM IN A STATE OF CHAOS
HENCE THE SAGE IS ABLE IN THE SAME WAY TO ACCOMPLISH HIS GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS IT IS THROUGH HIS NOT MAKING HIMSELF GREAT THAT HE CAN ACCOMPLISH THEM
LET THE KINGDOM BE GOVERNED ACCORDING TO THE TAO AND THE MANES OF THE DEPARTED WILL NOT MANIFEST THEIR SPIRITUAL ENERGY IT IS NOT THAT THOSE MANES HAVE NOT THAT SPIRITUAL ENERGY BUT IT WILL NOT BE EMPLOYED TO HURT MEN
HE WHO KNOWS IT WILL KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT AND CLOSE THE PORTALS OF HIS NOSTRILS HE WILL BLUNT HIS SHARP POINTS AND UNRAVEL THE COMPLICATIONS OF THINGS HE WILL ATTEMPER HIS BRIGHTNESS AND BRING HIMSELF INTO AGREEMENT
HE USES THEM ONLY ON THE COMPULSION OF NECESSITY CALM AND REPOSE ARE WHAT HE PRIZES VICTORY BY FORCE OF ARMS IS TO HIM UNDESIRABLE TO CONSIDER THIS DESIRABLE
THOSE THREE METHODS OF GOVERNMENT THOUGHT OLDEN WAYS IN ELEGANCE DID FAIL AND MADE THESE NAMES THEIR WANT OF WORTH TO VEIL BUT SIMPLE VIEWS AND COURSES PLAIN AND TRUE
THIS IS THE REASON WHY ALL UNDER HEAVEN CONSIDER IT THE MOST VALUABLE THING
HE WHO WOULD ASSIST A LORD OF MEN IN HARMONY WITH THE TAO WILL NOT ASSERT HIS MASTERY IN THE KINGDOM BY FORCE OF ARMS SUCH A COURSE IS SURE TO MEET WITH ITS PROPER RETURN
THE MASTER OF IT ANTICIPATES THINGS THAT ARE DIFFICULT WHILE THEY ARE EASY AND DOES THINGS THAT WOULD BECOME GREAT WHILE THEY ARE SMALL ALL DIFFICULT THINGS IN THE WORLD ARE SURE TO ARISE FROM A PREVIOUS STATE IN WHICH THEY WERE EASY
HE WHO POSSESSES THE MOTHER OF THE STATE MAY CONTINUE LONG HIS CASE IS LIKE THAT OF THE PLANT OF WHICH WE SAY THAT ITS ROOTS ARE DEEP AND ITS FLOWER STALKS FIRM THIS IS THE WAY TO SECURE THAT ITS ENDURING LIFE SHALL LONG BE SEEN
AS SOON AS IT PROCEEDS TO ACTION IT HAS A NAME WHEN IT ONCE HAS THAT NAME MEN CAN KNOW TO REST IN IT WHEN THEY KNOW TO REST IN IT THEY CAN BE FREE FROM ALL RISK OF FAILURE AND ERROR
FROM SELF BOASTING AND THEREFORE HIS MERIT IS ACKNOWLEDGED FROM SELF COMPLACENCY AND THEREFORE HE ACQUIRES SUPERIORITY IT IS BECAUSE HE IS THUS FREE FROM STRIVING THAT THEREFORE NO ONE IN THE WORLD IS ABLE TO STRIVE WITH HIM
IT IS ONLY BY THIS MODERATION THAT THERE IS EFFECTED AN EARLY RETURN TO MAN'S NORMAL STATE THAT EARLY RETURN IS WHAT I CALL THE REPEATED ACCUMULATION OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE TAO
HE WHO WOULD SO WIN IT DESTROYS IT HE WHO WOULD HOLD IT IN HIS GRASP LOSES IT
AND ALL GREAT THINGS FROM ONE IN WHICH THEY WERE SMALL THEREFORE THE SAGE WHILE HE NEVER DOES WHAT IS GREAT IS ABLE ON THAT ACCOUNT TO ACCOMPLISH THE GREATEST THINGS
FOR REGULATING THE HUMAN IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND RENDERING THE PROPER SERVICE TO THE HEAVENLY THERE IS NOTHING LIKE MODERATION
