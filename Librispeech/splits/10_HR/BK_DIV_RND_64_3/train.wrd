OF AN IMPULSIVE AND PASSIONATE NATURE SHE HAD FORTIFIED HERSELF TO ENCOUNTER THE STINGS AND VENOMOUS STABS OF PUBLIC CONTUMELY
FAR AND DEEP IN ITS OWN REGION BUSYING ITSELF WITH PRETERNATURAL ACTIVITY TO MARSHAL A PROCESSION OF STATELY THOUGHTS THAT WERE SOON TO ISSUE THENCE AND SO HE SAW NOTHING
AND BREEDING THAN IN THEIR FAIR DESCENDANTS SEPARATED FROM THEM BY A SERIES OF SIX OR SEVEN GENERATIONS FOR THROUGHOUT THAT CHAIN OF ANCESTRY EVERY SUCCESSIVE MOTHER HAD TRANSMITTED TO HER CHILD A FAINTER BLOOM A MORE DELICATE AND BRIEFER BEAUTY
METHINKS MY SOUL MIGHT KEEP ITSELF ALIVE THEREBY
THE INDELICACY THE HORRIBLE UGLINESS OF THIS EXPOSURE OF A SICK AND GUILTY HEART
BY AN ACTION MARKED WITH NATURAL DIGNITY AND FORCE OF CHARACTER AND STEPPED INTO THE OPEN AIR AS IF BY HER OWN FREE WILL SHE BORE IN HER ARMS A CHILD A BABY OF SOME THREE MONTHS OLD WHO WINKED AND TURNED ASIDE ITS LITTLE FACE FROM THE TOO VIVID LIGHT OF DAY
WOULD THAT IT WERE TURNED TO SCORN AND HATRED CANST THOU DEEM IT HESTER A CONSOLATION THAT I MUST STAND UP IN MY PULPIT AND MEET SO MANY EYES TURNED UPWARD TO MY FACE
SELF CONSTITUTED JUDGES THIS WOMAN HAS BROUGHT SHAME UPON US ALL AND OUGHT TO DIE IS THERE NOT LAW FOR IT TRULY THERE IS BOTH IN THE SCRIPTURE AND THE STATUTE BOOK THEN LET THE MAGISTRATES WHO HAVE MADE IT OF NO EFFECT
IT IS ALL FALSEHOOD
FOR TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS PAST HAS BEEN MERELY HISTORICAL AND TRADITIONARY AMONG US BUT WAS HELD IN THE OLD TIME
WRITE ACT DO ANYTHING SAVE TO LIE DOWN AND DIE GIVE UP THIS NAME OF ARTHUR DIMMESDALE
TURNING A CORNER AND MAKING ITS WAY ACROSS THE MARKET PLACE FIRST CAME THE MUSIC IT COMPRISED A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS PERHAPS IMPERFECTLY ADAPTED TO ONE ANOTHER AND PLAYED WITH NO GREAT SKILL
THEY HAVE KEPT THY BETTER PART IN BONDAGE TOO LONG ALREADY IT CANNOT BE ANSWERED THE MINISTER LISTENING AS IF HE WERE CALLED UPON TO REALISE A DREAM I AM POWERLESS TO GO WRETCHED AND SINFUL AS I AM
OF THAT SACRED IMAGE OF SINLESS MOTHERHOOD WHOSE INFANT WAS TO REDEEM THE WORLD HERE THERE WAS THE TAINT OF DEEPEST SIN IN THE MOST SACRED QUALITY OF HUMAN LIFE WORKING SUCH EFFECT THAT THE WORLD WAS ONLY THE DARKER FOR THIS WOMAN'S BEAUTY
AND IN TIME OF DIFFICULTY OR PERIL STOOD UP FOR THE WELFARE OF THE STATE LIKE A LINE OF CLIFFS AGAINST A TEMPESTUOUS TIDE THE TRAITS OF CHARACTER HERE INDICATED
ON WHOM THE SENTENCE OF A LEGAL TRIBUNAL HAD BUT CONFIRMED THE VERDICT OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT BUT IN THAT EARLY SEVERITY OF THE PURITAN CHARACTER AN INFERENCE OF THIS KIND COULD NOT SO INDUBITABLY BE DRAWN
FROM THIS TIME TILL AN HOUR PAST MERIDIAN A BLESSING ON THE RIGHTEOUS COLONY OF THE MASSACHUSETTS WHERE INIQUITY IS DRAGGED OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE COME ALONG MADAME HESTER AND SHOW YOUR SCARLET LETTER IN THE MARKET PLACE
THOU MUST DWELL NO LONGER WITH THIS MAN SAID HESTER SLOWLY AND FIRMLY THY HEART
GRASP AND THUS HOLD IT UP TO THE PUBLIC GAZE THE VERY IDEAL OF IGNOMINY
OF TWO SPIRITS WHO HAD BEEN INTIMATELY CONNECTED IN THEIR FORMER LIFE BUT NOW STOOD COLDLY SHUDDERING IN MUTUAL DREAD AS NOT YET FAMILIAR WITH THEIR STATE
WOULD BUT POORLY SERVE TO HIDE ANOTHER SHE TOOK THE BABY ON HER ARM AND WITH A BURNING BLUSH AND YET A HAUGHTY SMILE AND A GLANCE THAT WOULD NOT BE ABASHED LOOKED AROUND AT HER TOWNSPEOPLE AND NEIGHBOURS ON THE BREAST OF HER GOWN
SHE SHOULD STAND A CERTAIN TIME UPON THE PLATFORM BUT WITHOUT UNDERGOING THAT GRIPE ABOUT THE NECK AND CONFINEMENT OF THE HEAD THE PRONENESS TO WHICH WAS THE MOST DEVILISH CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS UGLY ENGINE
WAS WHAT HESTER COULD NOT BEAR AND LIVE WILT THOU YET FORGIVE ME SHE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WILT THOU NOT FROWN WILT THOU FORGIVE
CLAD IN BURNISHED STEEL AND WITH PLUMAGE NODDING OVER THEIR BRIGHT MORIONS HAD A BRILLIANCY OF EFFECT WHICH NO MODERN DISPLAY CAN ASPIRE TO EQUAL AND YET THE MEN OF CIVIL EMINENCE
THE PASTOR AND HIS PARISHIONER SLOWLY AS THE MINISTER WALKED HE HAD ALMOST GONE BY BEFORE HESTER PRYNNE COULD GATHER VOICE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT HIS OBSERVATION AT LENGTH SHE SUCCEEDED
TRUTH WAS THE ONE VIRTUE WHICH I MIGHT HAVE HELD FAST AND DID HOLD FAST THROUGH ALL EXTREMITY SAVE WHEN THY GOOD THY LIFE THY FAME WERE PUT IN QUESTION THEN I CONSENTED
LONG CONTINUED THOUGHT OR PERCHANCE HIS SENSITIVE TEMPERAMENT WAS INVIGORATED BY THE LOUD AND PIERCING MUSIC THAT SWELLED HEAVEN WARD AND UPLIFTED HIM ON ITS ASCENDING WAVE NEVERTHELESS
IN FRANCE IN PLEASANT ITALY
OTHER FACES THAN WERE LOWERING UPON HER FROM BENEATH THE BRIMS OF THOSE STEEPLE CROWNED HATS
OR OTHER DARKSOME APARTMENT OF THE PRISON
NEVER NEVER WHISPERED SHE WHAT WE DID HAD A CONSECRATION OF ITS OWN WE FELT IT SO WE SAID SO TO EACH OTHER HAST THOU FORGOTTEN IT
WITH WHOM TO WEEP OVER THY SIN THOU HAST IN ME
AND AS FOR THE RED LETTER WHICH SHE HATH STITCHED SO CURIOUSLY I'LL BESTOW A RAG OF MINE OWN RHEUMATIC FLANNEL TO MAKE A FITTER ONE OH PEACE NEIGHBOURS PEACE WHISPERED THEIR YOUNGEST COMPANION DO NOT LET HER HEAR YOU
AND SEEMED TO BE BORNE UPWARD LIKE A FLOATING SEA BIRD ON THE LONG HEAVES AND SWELLS OF SOUND BUT SHE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO HER FORMER MOOD BY THE SHIMMER OF THE SUNSHINE ON THE WEAPONS AND BRIGHT ARMOUR OF THE MILITARY COMPANY WHICH FOLLOWED AFTER THE MUSIC AND FORMED THE HONORARY ESCORT OF THE PROCESSION
INDUCEMENTS POWERFUL ENOUGH IN THE ALMOST WORSHIPPING RESPECT OF THE COMMUNITY TO WIN THE MOST ASPIRING AMBITION INTO ITS SERVICE EVEN POLITICAL POWER AS IN THE CASE OF INCREASE MATHER WAS WITHIN THE GRASP OF A SUCCESSFUL PRIEST
AND IS PARTLY PERHAPS FOR BOTH IN THAT OLD DAY THE ENGLISH SETTLER ON THESE RUDE SHORES HAVING LEFT KING NOBLES AND ALL DEGREES OF AWFUL RANK BEHIND
IF THOU PREFER TO CROSS THE SEA LEAVE THIS WRECK AND RUIN HERE WHERE IT HATH HAPPENED
YET THOSE SAME BLEARED OPTICS HAD A STRANGE PENETRATING POWER
THE UNHAPPY CULPRIT SUSTAINED HERSELF AS BEST A WOMAN MIGHT UNDER THE HEAVY WEIGHT OF A THOUSAND UNRELENTING EYES ALL FASTENED UPON HER
BUT YET ATTAINING THE GREAT OBJECT FOR WHICH THE HARMONY OF DRUM AND CLARION ADDRESSES ITSELF TO THE MULTITUDE
BE A SCHOLAR AND A SAGE AMONG THE WISEST AND THE MOST RENOWNED OF THE CULTIVATED WORLD
BUT UNDER THE LEADEN INFLICTION WHICH IT WAS HER DOOM TO ENDURE SHE FELT AT MOMENTS AS IF SHE MUST NEEDS SHRIEK OUT WITH THE FULL POWER OF HER LUNGS AND CAST HERSELF FROM THE SCAFFOLD DOWN UPON THE GROUND OR ELSE GO MAD AT ONCE
DELINQUENCIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL NO OUTRAGE MORE FLAGRANT THAN TO FORBID THE CULPRIT TO HIDE HIS FACE FOR SHAME AS IT WAS THE ESSENCE OF THIS PUNISHMENT TO DO IN HESTER PRYNNE'S INSTANCE HOWEVER AS NOT UNFREQUENTLY IN OTHER CASES HER SENTENCE BORE THAT
NO GOLDEN LIGHT HAD EVER BEEN SO PRECIOUS AS THE GLOOM OF THIS DARK FOREST HERE SEEN ONLY BY HIS EYES THE SCARLET LETTER NEED NOT BURN INTO THE BOSOM OF THE FALLEN WOMAN
OF PENITENCE THERE HAS BEEN NONE ELSE I SHOULD LONG AGO HAVE THROWN OFF THESE GARMENTS OF MOCK HOLINESS AND HAVE SHOWN MYSELF TO MANKIND AS THEY WILL SEE ME AT THE JUDGMENT SEAT HAPPY ARE YOU HESTER
WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE SQUARE CAST OF COUNTENANCE AND LARGE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW COLONIAL MAGISTRATES SO FAR AS A DEMEANOUR OF NATURAL AUTHORITY WAS CONCERNED THE MOTHER COUNTRY NEED NOT HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO SEE
HESTER SAID HE HAST THOU FOUND PEACE SHE SMILED DREARILY LOOKING DOWN UPON HER BOSOM HAST THOU SHE ASKED NONE NOTHING BUT DESPAIR HE ANSWERED
AS IF TELLING THE SAD STORY OF THE PAIR THAT SAT BENEATH OR CONSTRAINED TO FORBODE EVIL TO COME AND YET THEY LINGERED HOW DREARY LOOKED THE FOREST TRACK
FOR BEING ABLE SO COMPLETELY TO WITHDRAW HIMSELF FROM THEIR MUTUAL WORLD
IF AN INTENSE SCENE HAD CAUGHT HIM WITH ITS WILD SWING AS HE CAME TO THE TOP OF THE BANK
THAT PERHAPS IN A BATTLE HE MIGHT RUN HE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT THAT AS FAR AS WAR WAS CONCERNED HE KNEW NOTHING OF HIMSELF
HE SPREAD THE RUBBER ONE UPON THE GROUND AND PLACED THE WOOLEN ONE ABOUT THE YOUTH'S SHOULDERS THERE NOW HE SAID LIE DOWN AN GIT SOME SLEEP THE YOUTH WITH HIS MANNER OF DOGLIKE OBEDIENCE
AND ONCE AS HIS FRIEND ROLLED HIS EYES HE SAW SOMETHING IN THEM THAT MADE HIM SINK WAILING TO THE GROUND HE RAISED HIS VOICE IN A LAST SUPREME CALL JIM JIM JIM
OR TO DEVELOP EM OR SOMETHING
HOL ON A MINNIT CONTINUED THE YOUTH
WAS A SERIES OF DEATH STRUGGLES WITH SMALL TIME IN BETWEEN FOR SLEEP AND MEALS BUT SINCE HIS REGIMENT HAD COME TO THE FIELD THE ARMY HAD DONE LITTLE
AS IF HE WERE TAKING INFINITE CARE NOT TO AROUSE THE PASSION OF HIS WOUNDS AS HE WENT ON HE SEEMED ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A PLACE LIKE ONE WHO GOES TO CHOOSE A GRAVE
HE STARED INTO SPACE TO THE TWO WATCHERS THERE WAS A CURIOUS AND PROFOUND DIGNITY IN THE FIRM LINES OF HIS AWFUL FACE HE WAS INVADED BY A CREEPING STRANGENESS THAT SLOWLY ENVELOPED HIM
A FLAG FLUTTERED OTHER REGIMENTS FLOUNDERED UP THE BANK THE BRIGADE WAS FORMED IN LINE OF BATTLE AND AFTER A PAUSE STARTED SLOWLY THROUGH THE WOODS IN THE REAR OF THE RECEDING SKIRMISHERS
WERE QUITE OVERWHELMED WITH PRIVILEGES FOR ALL OF ONE AFTERNOON AND IT HAD BEEN A VERY DELICIOUS THING THEY HAD STRUTTED A CERTAIN LIGHT HAIRED GIRL HAD MADE VIVACIOUS FUN AT HIS MARTIAL SPIRIT
AND WAS IN TRUTH A MAN OF TRADITIONAL COURAGE
A BRIGADE AHEAD OF THEM AND ON THE RIGHT WENT INTO ACTION WITH A RENDING ROAR IT WAS AS IF IT HAD EXPLODED AND THEREAFTER IT LAY STRETCHED IN THE DISTANCE BEHIND A LONG GRAY WALL
HE TILTED HIS HEAD AFAR BACK AND HELD THE CANTEEN LONG TO HIS LIPS THE COOL MIXTURE WENT CARESSINGLY DOWN HIS BLISTERED THROAT HAVING FINISHED HE SIGHED WITH COMFORTABLE DELIGHT
AN A LEARNING EM TO DRINK AND SWEAR
BUT HERE HE WAS CONFRONTED WITH A THING OF MOMENT
THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER CAME SWINGING TWO CANTEENS BY THEIR LIGHT STRINGS WELL NOW HENRY OL BOY SAID THE LATTER WE'LL HAVE YEH FIXED UP IN JEST ABOUT A MINNIT HE HAD THE BUSTLING WAYS OF AN AMATEUR NURSE
ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO LEAVE A LITTLE PROTECTION OF STONES AND DIRT TO WHICH HE HAD DEVOTED MUCH CARE AND SKILL WHEN THE REGIMENT WAS ALIGNED IN ANOTHER POSITION EACH MAN'S REGARD FOR HIS SAFETY CAUSED ANOTHER LINE OF SMALL INTRENCHMENTS
OF HEAVY CROWNS AND HIGH CASTLES THERE WAS A PORTION OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY WHICH HE HAD REGARDED AS THE TIME OF WARS BUT IT HE THOUGHT HAD BEEN LONG GONE OVER THE HORIZON
HE HAD REFRAINED FROM ADDING EXTENSIVELY TO THE COMFORT OF HIS ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE HE HAD FELT THAT THE ARMY MIGHT START ON THE MARCH AT ANY MOMENT OF LATE HOWEVER HE HAD BEEN IMPRESSED THAT THEY WERE IN A SORT OF ETERNAL CAMP MANY OF THE MEN ENGAGED IN A SPIRITED DEBATE ONE
THE NOISE OF FIRING DOGGED THEIR FOOTSTEPS SOMETIMES IT SEEMED TO BE DRIVEN A LITTLE WAY BUT IT ALWAYS RETURNED AGAIN WITH INCREASED INSOLENCE THE MEN MUTTERED AND CURSED THROWING BLACK LOOKS IN ITS DIRECTION
HE COULD SEE THE FORMS OF MEN THROWING BLACK SHADOWS IN THE RED LIGHT AND AS HE WENT NEARER IT BECAME KNOWN TO HIM IN SOME WAY THAT THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH SLEEPING MEN
THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER WATCHED HIS COMRADE WITH AN AIR OF SATISFACTION HE LATER PRODUCED AN EXTENSIVE HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS POCKET
THE ARMY AWAKENED AND BEGAN TO TREMBLE WITH EAGERNESS AT THE NOISE OF RUMORS IT CAST ITS EYES UPON THE ROADS WHICH WERE GROWING FROM LONG TROUGHS OF LIQUID MUD TO PROPER THOROUGHFARES
IT'S OUR LUCK T GIT LICKED OFTEN SAID HIS FRIEND IN A WEARY TONE HE WAS TRUDGING ALONG WITH STOOPED SHOULDERS AND SHIFTING EYES LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CANED AND KICKED WELL DON'T WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL
HIS FACE HAD BEEN TWISTED INTO AN EXPRESSION OF EVERY AGONY HE HAD IMAGINED FOR HIS FRIEND HE NOW SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND GOING CLOSER GAZED UPON THE PASTELIKE FACE THE MOUTH WAS OPEN AND THE TEETH
SMOKE CLOUDS WENT SLOWLY AND INSOLENTLY ACROSS THE FIELDS LIKE OBSERVANT PHANTOMS THE DIN BECAME CRESCENDO LIKE THE ROAR OF AN ONCOMING TRAIN
MEN EXTRICATED THEMSELVES FROM THICK SHIRTS PRESENTLY FEW CARRIED ANYTHING BUT THEIR NECESSARY CLOTHING BLANKETS HAVERSACKS CANTEENS AND ARMS AND AMMUNITION YOU CAN NOW EAT AND SHOOT
THE GREATER PART OF THE UNTESTED MEN APPEARED QUIET AND ABSORBED THEY WERE GOING TO LOOK AT WAR THE RED ANIMAL WAR THE BLOOD SWOLLEN GOD AND THEY WERE DEEPLY ENGROSSED IN THIS MARCH
THESE FACES EXPRESSED IN THEIR LINES THE DEEP STUPOR OF THE TIRED SOLDIERS THEY MADE THEM APPEAR LIKE MEN DRUNK WITH WINE THIS BIT OF FOREST MIGHT HAVE APPEARED TO AN ETHEREAL WANDERER
HIS FACE WAS SO DRY AND GRIMY THAT HE THOUGHT HE COULD FEEL HIS SKIN CRACKLE EACH BONE OF HIS BODY HAD AN ACHE IN IT AND SEEMINGLY THREATENED TO BREAK WITH EACH MOVEMENT HIS FEET WERE LIKE TWO SORES
THIS IMPORTANCE MADE THEIR FACES GRAVE AND STERN AND THE BACKS OF THE OFFICERS WERE VERY RIGID AS THE YOUTH LOOKED AT THEM THE BLACK WEIGHT OF HIS WOE RETURNED TO HIM
WHO WERE CONTINUALLY MELTING INTO THE SCENE TO APPEAR AGAIN FARTHER ON THEY WERE ALWAYS BUSY AS BEES DEEPLY ABSORBED IN THEIR LITTLE COMBATS THE YOUTH TRIED TO OBSERVE EVERYTHING
OH SHUT UP ROARED THE TALL PRIVATE YOU LITTLE FOOL YOU LITTLE DAMN CUSS
SO WOULD I SAID THE LOUD SOLDIER IT AIN'T RIGHT
WELL CRIED THE YOUTH STILL FIDGETING
I GUESS YEH'LL COME OUT ABOUT RIGHT YEH MUST ALLUS REMEMBER YER FATHER TOO CHILD AN REMEMBER HE NEVER DRUNK A DROP OF LICKER IN HIS LIFE AND SELDOM SWORE A CROSS OATH
AFTER A TIME THE BRIGADE WAS HALTED IN THE CATHEDRAL LIGHT OF A FOREST THE BUSY SKIRMISHERS WERE STILL POPPING THROUGH THE AISLES OF THE WOOD COULD BE SEEN THE FLOATING SMOKE FROM THEIR RIFLES
BUT THE REGIMENT WAS NOT YET VETERANLIKE IN APPEARANCE
THERE WAS PERSPIRATION AND GRUMBLINGS AFTER A TIME THEY BEGAN TO SHED THEIR KNAPSACKS SOME TOSSED THEM UNCONCERNEDLY DOWN OTHERS HID THEM CAREFULLY ASSERTING THEIR PLANS TO RETURN FOR THEM AT SOME CONVENIENT TIME
NOW HENRY HE SAID LET'S HAVE LOOK AT YER OL HEAD
MA I'VE ENLISTED HE HAD SAID TO HER DIFFIDENTLY THERE WAS A SHORT SILENCE THE LORD'S WILL BE DONE HENRY SHE HAD FINALLY REPLIED AND HAD THEN CONTINUED TO MILK THE BRINDLE COW
AND THEN WE BEGIN TO FIGHT AND THE REBS HAD AN EASY TIME OF IT DON'T TELL ME IT'S JUST LUCK I KNOW BETTER IT'S THIS DERNED OLD THE FRIEND SEEMED JADED BUT HE INTERRUPTED HIS COMRADE WITH A VOICE OF CALM CONFIDENCE
AND WITH NO APPARENT DIFFICULTY GIVE HIM MANY HUNDREDS OF REASONS WHY HE WAS OF VASTLY MORE IMPORTANCE ON THE FARM THAN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
HE HAD GROWN TO REGARD HIMSELF MERELY AS A PART OF A VAST BLUE DEMONSTRATION HIS PROVINCE WAS TO LOOK OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD FOR HIS PERSONAL COMFORT FOR RECREATION HE COULD TWIDDLE HIS THUMBS AND SPECULATE ON THE THOUGHTS
SO THEY WERE AT LAST GOING TO FIGHT ON THE MORROW PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE A BATTLE AND HE WOULD BE IN IT FOR A TIME HE WAS OBLIGED TO LABOR TO MAKE HIMSELF BELIEVE
HE WAS SWELLED WITH A TALE HE HAD HEARD FROM A RELIABLE FRIEND
FROM HIS HOME HIS YOUTHFUL EYES HAD LOOKED UPON THE WAR IN HIS OWN COUNTRY WITH DISTRUST IT MUST BE SOME SORT OF A PLAY AFFAIR HE HAD LONG DESPAIRED OF WITNESSING A GREEKLIKE STRUGGLE
THERE WAS AN APPALLING IMPRINT UPON THESE FACES THE STRUGGLE IN THE SMOKE HAD PICTURED AN EXAGGERATION OF ITSELF ON THE BLEACHED CHEEKS AND IN THE EYES WILD WITH ONE DESIRE
YES IT HURTS HURTS A GOOD DEAL HE REPLIED THERE WAS A FALTERING IN HIS VOICE OH SAID THE CORPORAL HE LINKED HIS ARM IN THE YOUTH'S AND DREW HIM FORWARD COME ON HENRY
THE SCIENTIFIC COMMISSION ASSEMBLED IN THE PROJECTILE OF THE GUN CLUB AFTER HAVING FOUNDED THEIR ARGUMENT ON FACTS RECENTLY OBSERVED DECIDE UNANIMOUSLY UPON THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON NO THE MOON
WERE PICTURESQUELY INTERLACED AGAINST THE WALLS THE GAS LIT UP IN FULL GLARE MYRIADS OF REVOLVERS GROUPED IN THE FORM OF LUSTRES WHILE GROUPS OF PISTOLS AND CANDELABRA FORMED OF MUSKETS BOUND TOGETHER
ALL HIS LIMBS COMPLETE HIS STRONGLY MARKED FEATURES SEEMED DRAWN BY SQUARE AND RULE AND IF IT BE TRUE THAT IN ORDER TO JUDGE A MAN'S CHARACTER ONE MUST LOOK AT HIS PROFILE BARBICANE SO EXAMINED EXHIBITED THE MOST CERTAIN INDICATIONS OF ENERGY
PROBABLY WITHDRAWN BY TERRESTRIAL ATTRACTION THEN AERIAL DEPARTURE OF RESPIRABLE AIR AND DISAPPEARANCE OF WATER BY MEANS OF EVAPORATION AT THIS PERIOD THE MOON BECOMING UNINHABITABLE WAS NO LONGER INHABITED IT WAS A DEAD WORLD
HANG A FEW OF OUR COUNTRYMEN NO SUCH LUCK REPLIED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY NOTHING OF THE KIND IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN AND EVEN IF IT DID WE SHOULD NOT PROFIT BY IT AMERICAN SUSCEPTIBILITY IS FAST DECLINING AND WE ARE ALL GOING TO THE DOGS
EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN THAT THE MOON DID NOT EXIST BEFORE THE EARTH THEIR IMAGINATIONS CARRIED THEM AWAY INTO AN INDEFINITE FIELD OF HYPOTHESIS BARBICANE SOUGHT TO RESTRAIN THEM
RIDICULOUS REPLIED TOM HUNTER WHITTLING WITH HIS BOWIE KNIFE THE ARMS OF HIS EASY CHAIR BUT IF THAT BE THE CASE THERE ALL THAT IS LEFT FOR US IS TO PLANT TOBACCO AND DISTILL WHALE OIL WHAT ROARED J T MASTON
NO SAID BARBICANE LET US STRETCH OURSELVES ON OUR SIDES WE SHALL RESIST THE SHOCK BETTER THAT WAY REMEMBER THAT WHEN THE PROJECTILE STARTS IT MATTERS LITTLE WHETHER WE ARE IN IT OR BEFORE IT
FLOODED THE PROJECTILE WITH LIGHT AT THAT MOMENT BARBICANE THOUGHT HE COULD ESTIMATE THE DISTANCE WHICH SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR AIM AT NO MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED LEAGUES THE SPEED OF THE PROJECTILE SEEMED TO HIM TO BE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
BUT THAT THEY EXHIBITED UNHEARD OF DIMENSIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY ATTAINED HITHERTO UNHEARD OF RANGES IN POINT OF GRAZING PLUNGING OBLIQUE OR ENFILADING OR POINT BLANK FIRING THE ENGLISH
I BELIEVE INDEED I AFFIRM THAT THE MOON HAS BEEN INHABITED BY A HUMAN RACE ORGANIZED LIKE OUR OWN THAT SHE HAS PRODUCED ANIMALS ANATOMICALLY FORMED LIKE THE TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS
A CIRCULAR HOLE SIXTY FEET IN DIAMETER THE PICKAXE FIRST STRUCK UPON A KIND OF BLACK EARTH SIX INCHES IN THICKNESS WHICH WAS SPEEDILY DISPOSED OF TO THIS EARTH SUCCEEDED TWO FEET OF FINE SAND
FOREMEN AND WORKMEN WAITED THE PRECONCERTED MOMENT WITH AN IMPATIENCE MINGLED WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EMOTION NOT A SOUL REMAINED WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE EACH SUPERINTENDENT TOOK HIS POST BY THE APERTURE OF THE RUN
SEPARATELY PIECED AND NUMBERED AT THE SAME PERIOD BARBICANE LAID THE FIRST SLEEPERS OF A RAILWAY FIFTEEN MILES IN LENGTH INTENDED TO UNITE STONES HILL WITH TAMPA TOWN ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER BARBICANE QUITTED TAMPA TOWN WITH A DETACHMENT OF WORKMEN
THE NEWSPAPERS GREW MOULDY ON THE TABLES SOUNDS OF SNORING CAME FROM DARK CORNERS AND THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB
AND THEY MIGHT HOPE THAT AT A NEARER POINT THE WEIGHT PREDOMINATING WOULD CAUSE A DECIDED FALL THE THREE FRIENDS HAVING NOTHING BETTER TO DO CONTINUED THEIR OBSERVATIONS BUT THEY COULD NOT YET DETERMINE THE TOPOGRAPHICAL POSITION OF THE SATELLITE
THE MEANS OF ARRIVING THITHER ARE SIMPLE EASY CERTAIN INFALLIBLE AND THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF MY PRESENT PROPOSAL A STORM OF ACCLAMATIONS GREETED THESE WORDS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE WHOLE AUDIENCE WHO WAS NOT OVERCOME CARRIED AWAY
THAT NASMYTH WAS NO FOOL REPLIED MICHEL
ANOTHER BY A SLIGHT CURVE FURROWED THE SEA OF NECTAR BREAKING AGAINST
AFTER A PERIOD OF YEARS FULL OF INCIDENTS WE HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON OUR LABORS AND TO STOP SHORT ON THE ROAD OF PROGRESS I DO NOT HESITATE TO STATE BALDLY THAT ANY WAR WHICH WOULD RECALL US TO ARMS WOULD BE WELCOME TREMENDOUS APPLAUSE
BARBICANE AND NICHOLL COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THEIR COMPANION'S UNEASINESS
THE WHEEL PARTLY GAVE WAY AND A SLIGHT PARTIAL SETTLEMENT ENSUED THIS ACCIDENT COST THE LIFE OF SEVERAL WORKMEN NO FRESH OCCURRENCE THENCEFORWARD ARRESTED THE PROGRESS OF THE OPERATION
EVERY ONE MUST SEE THAT THAT INVOLVED THE COMMENCEMENT OF A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS ALL MUST HOPE THAT SOME DAY AMERICA
WHICH THE AMERICAN LANGUAGE IS CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING IT WAS A SCENE OF INDESCRIBABLE CONFUSION AND UPROAR THEY SHOUTED THEY CLAPPED THEY STAMPED ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL ALL THE WEAPONS IN THE MUSEUM DISCHARGED AT ONCE
HIS EYE FIXED ON THE NEEDLE HIS FINGER ON THE ELECTRIC APPARATUS IS COUNTING THE SECONDS PREPARATORY TO LAUNCHING US INTO INTERPLANETARY SPACE ENOUGH MICHEL ENOUGH
AS THOUGH SHE COMPREHENDED ALL THIS AGITATION REGARDING HERSELF THE MOON SHONE FORTH WITH SERENE SPLENDOR ECLIPSING BY HER INTENSE ILLUMINATION ALL THE SURROUNDING LIGHTS THE YANKEES ALL TURNED THEIR GAZE TOWARD HER RESPLENDENT ORB KISSED THEIR HANDS
THEY HAVE IN FACT MORE REGARD FOR HUMAN NATURE IN GENERAL THAN FOR THE INDIVIDUAL IN PARTICULAR NEVERTHELESS BARBICANE PROFESSED OPPOSITE PRINCIPLES TO THESE AND PUT THEM IN FORCE AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY SO
ANTECEDENTS OF THE GUN CLUB AND IT CANNOT FAIL TO MAKE SOME NOISE IN THE WORLD A THRILL OF EXCITEMENT RAN THROUGH THE MEETING BARBICANE HAVING BY A RAPID MOVEMENT FIRMLY FIXED HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD CALMLY CONTINUED HIS HARANGUE
THE SHOCK WHICH PRODUCED THAT RENT
ALL THE PAPERS PAMPHLETS REPORTS ALL THE JOURNALS PUBLISHED BY THE SCIENTIFIC LITERARY AND RELIGIOUS SOCIETIES ENLARGED UPON ITS ADVANTAGES AND THE SOCIETY OF NATURAL HISTORY OF BOSTON THE SOCIETY OF SCIENCE AND ART OF ALBANY
AFTER THIS CONVERSATION EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION RECEIVED A SEALED CIRCULAR COUCHED IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS BALTIMORE OCTOBER THIRD THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB HAS THE HONOR TO INFORM HIS COLLEAGUES
CARRIED THE MOLTEN METAL DOWN TO THE CENTRAL WELL THE DAY FOLLOWING THAT ON WHICH THE WORKS OF THE MASONRY AND BORING HAD BEEN COMPLETED BARBICANE SET TO WORK UPON THE CENTRAL MOULD
TO DEADEN THE SHOCK IT WAS A PITY THAT BARBICANE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO EMPLOY THE MEANS WHICH HAD SO ABLY WEAKENED THE SHOCK AT DEPARTURE THAT IS TO SAY BY WATER USED AS SPRINGS AND THE PARTITION BREAKS THE PARTITIONS STILL EXISTED
WHICH MET WITH SUCH SUCCESS IN FRANCE SOMEWHAT LATER ANOTHER FRENCHMAN NAMED FONTENELLE WROTE THE PLURALITY OF WORLDS A
SHEEP WITH HORNS OF IVORY A WHITE SPECIES OF DEER AND INHABITANTS WITH MEMBRANOUS WINGS LIKE BATS THIS BROCHURE THE WORK OF AN AMERICAN NAMED LOCKE HAD A GREAT SALE BUT TO BRING THIS RAPID SKETCH TO A CLOSE
FOR SOME MOMENTS THE THREE TRAVELERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER THEN THEY BEGAN TO EXAMINE THE OBJECTS IMPRISONED WITH THEM EVERYTHING IS IN ITS PLACE SAID BARBICANE
INDEED SAID BARBICANE INDEED CONTINUED MICHEL IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY
AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THIS ATTRACTION WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ALTER THE MOTION OF THE MOON AT THAT PERIOD WHEN THE EARTH WAS STILL FLUID JUST SO REPLIED NICHOLL AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THE MOON HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SATELLITE OF THE EARTH
DONKEYS AND CHICKENS I BET THAT WE SHALL FIND CHICKENS A HUNDRED DOLLARS WE SHALL FIND NONE SAID NICHOLL DONE MY CAPTAIN REPLIED ARDAN CLASPING NICHOLL'S HAND BUT BY THE BYE
THE RUMBLING OF WHICH RESEMBLED THE ROLLING OF THUNDER THE POWERFUL VENTILATORS ADDED THEIR CONTINUOUS BLASTS AND SATURATED WITH OXYGEN THE GLOWING PLATES THE OPERATION TO BE SUCCESSFUL
AS THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE WILL ONE DAY BECOME BY COOLING BY COOLING CERTAINLY REPLIED BARBICANE AS THE INTERNAL FIRES BECAME EXTINGUISHED
J T MASTON BECAME THEIR CICERONE HE OMITTED NO POINT OF DETAIL HE CONDUCTED THEM THROUGHOUT THE MAGAZINES WORKSHOPS THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE ENGINES
THE CITY MAGNATES MUNICIPAL COUNCILORS AND SELECT MEN
THIS DEPTH WAS DOUBLED IN DECEMBER AND TREBLED IN JANUARY DURING THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY THE WORKMEN HAD TO CONTEND WITH A SHEET OF WATER WHICH MADE ITS WAY RIGHT ACROSS THE OUTER SOIL
COULD NOT HAVE MORE VIOLENTLY SET IN MOTION THE WAVES OF SOUND ONE NEED NOT BE SURPRISED AT THIS THERE ARE SOME CANNONEERS NEARLY AS NOISY AS THEIR OWN GUNS BARBICANE REMAINED CALM IN THE MIDST OF THIS ENTHUSIASTIC CLAMOR
THERE WERE TWENTY OF THEM AN OPENING LEFT IN THE DISC ALLOWED THEM TO LIGHT THE MATCH WITH WHICH EACH WAS PROVIDED ALL THE EFFECT WAS FELT OUTSIDE THE BURNING MIXTURE HAD ALREADY BEEN RAMMED INTO EACH GUN
AS IF WE HAD BEEN A LONG TIME AWAY IN SOME FAR STRANGE COUNTRY IN THE AFTERNOON WE REACHED STRAWBERRY VALLEY AND FELL ASLEEP NEXT MORNING WE SEEMED TO HAVE RISEN FROM THE DEAD MY BEDROOM WAS FLOODED WITH SUNSHINE
SNOWY ICE SCULPTURED RANGES BOUNDED THE HORIZON ALL AROUND WHILE THE GREAT LAKE EIGHTY MILES LONG AND FIFTY MILES WIDE LAY FULLY REVEALED BENEATH A LILY SKY
IN ABOUT THIRTEEN HOURS EVERY HOUR LIKE A YEAR DAY BEGAN TO DAWN BUT IT WAS LONG ERE THE SUMMIT'S ROCKS WERE TOUCHED BY THE SUN NO CLOUDS WERE VISIBLE FROM WHERE WE LAY YET THE MORNING WAS DULL AND BLUE AND BITTERLY FROSTY
AND THROUGHOUT ONE HUNGRY WINTER IN PARTICULAR THOUSANDS OF THE PEOPLE SUBSISTED CHIEFLY ON THE BULBS OF THE TULIPS CALLED SEGO BY THE INDIANS WHO TAUGHT THEM ITS USE LILIACEOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE RARE AMONG THE MORMONS
AT TWO O'CLOCK WE ROSE BREAKFASTED ON A WARMED TIN CUPFUL OF COFFEE AND A PIECE OF FROZEN VENISON BROILED ON THE COALS AND STARTED FOR THE SUMMIT UP TO THIS TIME THERE WAS NOTHING IN SIGHT THAT BETOKENED THE APPROACH OF A STORM
MUST HERE BE EXPOSED TO TERRIBLE TRIALS CITY CREEK COMING FROM ITS HIGH GLACIAL FOUNTAINS ENTERS THE STREETS OF THIS MORMON ZION PURE AS AN ANGEL BUT HOW DOES IT LEAVE IT
THE BEGINNING OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE TREASURED WRATH OF THE LORD UPON THE GENTILES FOR THE KILLING OF JOSEPH SMITH TO ME IT SEEMED A CORDIAL OUTPOURING OF NATURE'S LOVE BUT IT IS EASY TO DIFFER WITH SALT LATTER DAYS IN EVERYTHING STORMS WIVES
WHEN THE ICE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD WAS LAID LIKE A MANTLE OVER EVERY MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY THROUGHOUT ALL THESE IMMENSELY PROTRACTED PERIODS IN THE THRONG OF THESE MAJESTIC OPERATIONS NATURE KEPT HER FLOWER CHILDREN IN MIND SHE CONSIDERED THE LILIES
SURELY NOTHING IN HEAVEN NOR ANY MANSION OF THE LORD IN ALL HIS WORLDS COULD BE MORE GLORIOUSLY CARPETED OTHER PORTIONS OF THE PLAIN WERE FLUSHED WITH RED AND PURPLE AND ALL THE MOUNTAINS AND THE CLOUDS ABOVE THEM WERE PAINTED IN CORRESPONDING LOVELINESS
IN WHICH WE FANCIED WE SAW DRY RESINOUS LOGS SUITABLE FOR CAMPFIRES JUST AS AFTER GOING DAYS WITHOUT FOOD MEN FANCY THEY SEE BREAD FROZEN BLISTERED FAMISHED BENUMBED OUR BODIES SEEMED LOST TO US AT TIMES
IT WAS THE CALM AFTERGLOW THAT USUALLY SUCCEEDS THE FIRST STORM OF THE WINTER I MET MANY OF THE BIRDS THAT HAD REARED THEIR YOUNG AND SPENT THEIR SUMMER IN THE SHASTA WOODS AND CHAPARRAL THEY WERE THEN ON THEIR WAY SOUTH TO THEIR WINTER HOMES
I REACHED CAMP ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE DUSK HOLLOWED A STRIP OF LOOSE GROUND IN THE LEE OF A LARGE BLOCK OF RED LAVA WHERE FIREWOOD WAS ABUNDANT ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS AND WENT TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING
TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE BY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND SWIMMING TO THE ISLANDS OFF SHORE THE ELK AND PERHAPS ALSO THE MOOSE STILL EXIST IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE SOLITUDES OF THE FOREST BUT THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GREATLY REDUCED OF LATE
THEN SAILING OUT INTO THE THIN AZURE OVER THE PRECIPITOUS BRINK OF THE RIDGE THEY WERE DRIFTED TOGETHER LIKE WREATHS OF FOAM ON A RIVER THESE HIGHER AND FINER CLOUD FABRICS
AS THE TIME DREW NEAR TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO REACH CAMP WE BECAME CONCERNED TO KNOW WHAT STRENGTH WAS LEFT US AND WHETHER OR NO WE COULD WALK FOR WE HAD LAIN FLAT ALL THIS TIME WITHOUT ONCE RISING TO OUR FEET
MOSTLY BARE THAT EXTENDS FROM NEAR THE CAMP GROUND AT THE TIMBERLINE BUT ON MY FIRST EXCURSION TO THE SUMMIT THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO ITS LOW SWELLING BASE WAS SMOOTHLY LADEN WITH LOOSE FRESH SNOW
HUNGRY AT TIMES AND WEARY HE HAS CORRESPONDING ENJOYMENT IN EATING AND RESTING AND ALL THE WILDERNESS IS HOME SOME OF THESE RARE HAPPY ROVERS DIE ALONE AMONG THE LEAVES
THE ROAD LEADS THROUGH MAJESTIC WOODS WITH FERNS TEN FEET HIGH BENEATH SOME OF THE THICKETS AND ACROSS A GRAVELLY PLAIN DEFORESTED BY FIRE MANY YEARS AGO ORANGE LILIES ARE PLENTIFUL
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE CALENDAR SPRINGTIME OF UTAH HAS BEEN WINTER IN ALL THE UPPER CANYONS OF THE MOUNTAINS THE SNOW IS NOW FROM FIVE TO TEN FEET DEEP OR MORE AND MOST OF IT HAS FALLEN SINCE MARCH
MAKING HIS WAY WITH THE SKILL OF WILD ANIMALS ALL HIS SENSES IN ACTION WATCHFUL AND ALERT LOOKING KEENLY AT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT HIS IMAGINATION WELL NOURISHED IN THE WEALTH OF THE WILDERNESS COMING INTO CONTACT WITH FREE NATURE IN A THOUSAND FORMS
SEEMED TO TOUCH ONE ANOTHER AND FAIRLY TO THICKEN THE TREMENDOUS BLAST THAT CARRIED THEM THIS WAS THE BLOOM TIME THE SUMMER OF THE CLOUD AND NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN EVEN A MOUNTAIN CLOUD FLOWERING SO PROFUSELY
AND EVEN FULL BLOWN TRANSCENDENTALISTS THOUGH YOU MAY GO FAR TO FIND THEM INDIANS ARE SELDOM TO BE MET WITH AWAY FROM THE SOUND EXCEPTING ABOUT THE FEW OUTLYING HOP RANCHES TO WHICH THEY RESORT IN GREAT NUMBERS DURING THE PICKING SEASON
NOR IN YOUR WALKS IN THE WOODS WILL YOU BE LIKELY TO SEE MANY OF THE WILD ANIMALS HOWEVER FAR YOU MAY GO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL AND THE MOUNTAIN GOAT THE SQUIRREL IS EVERYWHERE AND THE GOAT YOU CAN HARDLY FAIL TO FIND IF YOU CLIMB ANY OF THE HIGH MOUNTAINS THE DEER
AS IF TO KNOW HOW THE WORK WAS ADVANCING DURING THESE CALM INTERVALS I REPLENISHED MY FIRE SOMETIMES WITHOUT LEAVING THE NEST FOR FIRE AND WOODPILE WERE SO NEAR THIS COULD EASILY BE DONE OR BUSIED MYSELF WITH MY NOTEBOOK
AFTER CAREFULLY SCANNING THE JAGGED TOWERS AND BATTLEMENTS WITH WHICH IT IS ROUGHENED I DETERMINED TO MAKE IT MY WAY THOUGH IT PRESENTED BUT A FEEBLE ADVERTISEMENT OF ITS FLORAL WEALTH THIS APPARENT BARRENNESS HOWEVER MADE NO GREAT OBJECTION JUST THEN
HE SAID THEY ARE NICE
THE CRYSTAL FLAKES FALLING IN THE FOUL STREETS WAS A PITIFUL SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VAUNTED REFINING INFLUENCES OF TOWNS PURITY OF ALL KINDS PURE HEARTS PURE STREAMS PURE SNOW
OUR FEEBLENESS ACCELERATING RATHER THAN DIMINISHING OUR SPEED WHEN WE HAD DESCENDED SOME THREE THOUSAND FEET THE SUNSHINE WARMED OUR BACKS AND WE BEGAN TO REVIVE AT TEN A M WE REACHED THE TIMBER AND WERE SAFE
AND FROM THE WINDOW I SAW THE GREAT WHITE SHASTA CONE CLAD IN FORESTS AND CLOUDS AND BEARING THEM LOFTILY IN THE SKY EVERYTHING SEEMED FULL AND RADIANT WITH THE FRESHNESS AND BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM OF YOUTH
AND INDICATED THE WAY AS WELL AS HE COULD IN THE DARKNESS HE SEEMED LOATH TO LEAVE ME BUT BEING REASSURED THAT I WAS AT HOME AND REQUIRED NO CARE HE BADE ME GOOD BYE AND RETURNED TO CAMP READY TO LEAD HIS ANIMALS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AT DAYBREAK
I WILL BATHE IN THE HIGH SKY AMONG COOL WIND WAVES FROM THE SNOW FROM THE MORE SOUTHERLY OF THE TWO PEAKS A LONG RIDGE COMES DOWN BENT LIKE A BOW ONE END IN THE HOT PLAINS THE OTHER IN THE SNOW OF THE SUMMIT
AND OUR GLORIOUS MORNING IN THE SKY PROMISED NOTHING BUT ENJOYMENT AT NINE A M THE DRY THERMOMETER STOOD AT THIRTY FOUR DEGREES IN THE SHADE AND ROSE STEADILY UNTIL AT ONE P M IT STOOD AT FIFTY DEGREES
THE POOL IS OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH AS IS SHOWN BY THE RADIATING WELL BEATEN FOAM AND MIST WHICH IS OF A BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR AT TIMES OF EXQUISITE FINENESS OF TONE AND BY THE HEAVY WAVES THAT LASH THE ROCKS IN FRONT OF IT
THESE AT LENGTH UNITED WITH THE OLDER FIELD TOWARDS LASSEN'S BUTTE THUS ENCIRCLING MOUNT SHASTA IN ONE CONTINUOUS CLOUD ZONE RHETT AND KLAMATH LAKES WERE ECLIPSED BENEATH CLOUDS SCARCELY LESS BRILLIANT THAN THEIR OWN SILVERY DISKS
PUTTING ON AIRS AS SOME WOULD SAY LIKE BOYS IN HASTE TO BE MEN THEY ARE ALREADY TOWNS WITH ALL MODERN IMPROVEMENTS FIRST CLASS IN EVERY PARTICULAR AS IS SAID OF HOTELS THEY HAVE ELECTRIC MOTORS AND LIGHTS
AND EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED HUNTERS HAVE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEM OF BEARS THERE ARE TWO SPECIES THE BLACK AND THE LARGE BROWN THE FORMER BY FAR THE MORE COMMON OF THE TWO ON THE SHAGGY BOTTOM LANDS WHERE BERRIES ARE PLENTIFUL
EVEN SHOULD HIS SUFFERINGS ADMIT OF SUCH A THING ACCORDINGLY WHEN DURING THE LONG DREARY WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WE ROUSED FROM A STATE OF HALF CONSCIOUSNESS WE CALLED EACH OTHER BY NAME IN A FRIGHTENED STARTLED WAY
THE FROST WAS INTENSE AND DRIFTING SNOW DUST MADE BREATHING AT TIMES RATHER DIFFICULT THE SNOW WAS AS DRY AS MEAL AND THE FINER PARTICLES DRIFTED FREELY RISING HIGH IN THE AIR WHILE THE LARGER PORTIONS OF THE CRYSTALS ROLLED LIKE SAND
PRESENTING A MOST GLORIOUS MASS OF WINTER MOUNTAIN SCENERY IN THE MIDST OF WHICH I SCRAMBLED AND REVELED OR LAY SNUGLY SNOWBOUND ENJOYING THE FERTILE CLOUDS AND THE SNOW BLOOM IN ALL THEIR GROWING DRIFTING GRANDEUR
LOOKING SOUTHWARD FROM THE SOUTH END OF SALT LAKE THE TWO NORTHMOST PEAKS OF THE OQUIRRH RANGE ARE SEEN SWELLING CALMLY INTO THE COOL SKY WITHOUT ANY MARKED CHARACTER EXCEPTING ONLY THEIR SNOW CROWNS
OX DRIVERS AND LOGGERS IN STIFF GUMMY OVERALLS BACK SLANTING DUDES WELL TAILORED AND SHINY AND FASHIONS AND BONNETS OF EVERY FEATHER AND COLOR BLOOM GAYLY IN THE NOISY THRONG AND ADVERTISE LONDON AND PARIS
MY POOR OLD GREAT AUNT DIED ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS AGO AND LEFT ME ENOUGH TO DO THIS I HAVE TAKEN A LITTLE FURNISHED HOUSE FOR A TIME TILL WE CAN GET ONE OF OUR OWN HE DESCRIBED THE PLACE AND THE SURROUNDINGS AND THE VIEW FROM THE WINDOWS AND GRACE BECAME MUCH INTERESTED
YOU ARE NOT DEAD YOU ARE NOT HURT THANK GOD THANK GOD HE SAID ALMOST SOBBING IN HIS DELIGHT AND RELIEF FROM THE HORROR OF HIS APPREHENSION GRACE MY WIFE MY LOVE HOW IS THIS WHAT HAS HAPPENED I WAS COMING ON TO YOU SHE SAID
THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD LOST HIS HOUSES BY AN ACCIDENT WHICH MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN CIRCUMVENTED IF HE HAD KNOWN THE TRUE CONDITIONS OF HIS HOLDING THE TIME FOR PERFORMANCE HAD NOW LAPSED IN STRICT LAW BUT MIGHT NOT THE INTENTION BE CONSIDERED BY THE LANDHOLDER WHEN SHE BECAME AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
AND WHY DIDN'T SHE MARRY HIM SAID MISSUS CHARMOND BECAUSE YOU SEE MA'AM HE LOST HIS HOUSES LOST HIS HOUSES
BUT THAT NEWLY DONE UP PLACE THE EARL OF WESSEX
I WON'T SAY TO YE YOU SHALL MARRY HIM BUT I WILL SAY THAT IF YOU REFUSE I SHALL FOREVER BE ASHAMED AND A WEARY OF YE AS A DAUGHTER AND SHALL LOOK UPON YOU AS THE HOPE OF MY LIFE NO MORE
MY EYES WERE SO HEAVY THIS MORNING THAT I COULD HAVE WEPT MY LIFE AWAY I CANNOT BEAR YOU TO SEE MY FACE I KEEP IT AWAY FROM YOU PURPOSELY
AND I DID NOT KNOW WHO THE PERSON MIGHT BE FITZPIERS HAD SPRUNG TO HIS FEET AND HIS NEXT ACT WAS NO LESS UNPREMEDITATED BY HIM THAN IT WAS IRRESISTIBLE BY HER AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SO BY ANY WOMAN NOT OF AMAZONIAN STRENGTH
TIS HOW I DO IT WHEN THEY BAINT HERE MAISTER
BUT THE NEXT MOMENT I DISCOVERED IT WAS IRON AND THAT MY CLOTHES WERE CAUGHT IN A TRAP I PULLED THIS WAY AND THAT BUT THE THING WOULD NOT LET GO
OF ALL THE DEGREES AND QUALITIES OF PUNISHMENT THAT FITZPIERS HAD UNDERGONE SINCE HIS SINS AGAINST GRACE FIRST BEGAN NOT ANY EVEN APPROXIMATED IN INTENSITY TO THIS OH MY OWN MY DARLING OH CRUEL HEAVEN IT IS TOO MUCH THIS
IN WHICH SHE HAD PICTURED HERSELF WALKING IN STATE TOWARDS THE ALTAR FLUSHED BY THE PURPLE LIGHT AND BLOOM OF HER OWN PASSION WITHOUT A SINGLE MISGIVING AS TO THE SEALING OF THE BOND AND FERVENTLY RECEIVING AS HER DUE
EACH TREE DOOMED TO THIS FLAYING PROCESS WAS FIRST ATTACKED BY CREEDLE WITH A SMALL BILLHOOK HE CAREFULLY FREED THE COLLAR OF THE TREE FROM TWIGS AND PATCHES OF MOSS WHICH INCRUSTED IT TO A HEIGHT OF A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE GROUND
SHE WOULD NOT COMPLAIN WHILE HE WAS DISPOSED TO CONTINUE WORK BUT WHEN HE PAUSED SHE SAID MISTER WINTERBORNE CAN I RUN DOWN THE LANE AND BACK TO WARM MY FEET WHY YES OF COURSE
THE HOUSE HAD BEEN PULLED DOWN YEARS BEFORE
I DIDN'T SEND FOR HIM MISSUS CHARMOND BEFORE SHE LEFT HEARD THAT FATHER WAS ILL AND TOLD HIM TO ATTEND HIM AT HER EXPENSE THAT WAS VERY GOOD OF HER AND HE SAYS IT OUGHT TO BE CUT DOWN
ALL I CAN SAY IS THEN THAT SHE OUGHT TO HOB AND NOB ELSEWHERE
THAT SOME OTHER PEDESTRIAN THAN THE ONE IN REQUEST MIGHT ARRIVE AND IT BEHOOVED TIM TO BE CAREFUL AS TO THE IDENTITY OF HIS VICTIM GOING ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS ALONG THE RISING GROUND TO THE RIGHT HE REACHED A RIDGE WHEREON A LARGE AND THICK HOLLY GREW
UP TO A FEW DAYS BEFORE THIS TIME THAT LADY HAD BEEN ACCOMPANIED IN HER COMINGS STAYINGS AND GOINGS BY A RELATIVE BELIEVED TO BE HER AUNT LATTERLY HOWEVER THESE TWO LADIES HAD SEPARATED
AND HERE'S MISTER WINTERBORNE SHE CONTINUED SHYLY AS SHE LOOKED TOWARDS FITZPIERS WHO STOOD IN THE BACKGROUND MARTY
HAD NOT MUCH PERSEVERANCE THOUGH
AND TO MAKE AMENDS I DETERMINED TO GIVE HER MY MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION TO MY FRIEND'S SON SEEING THAT THEY LIKED EACH OTHER WELL THINGS CAME ABOUT WHICH MADE ME DOUBT IF IT WOULD BE FOR MY DAUGHTER'S HAPPINESS TO DO THIS INASMUCH AS THE YOUNG MAN WAS POOR
THIS INCREASING COMPLICATION ADDED STILL MORE VALUE TO GRACE IN THE SURGEON'S EYES IT RENDERED HER ADORABLE BUT CANNOT YOU SAY HE PLEADED DISTRACTEDLY I'D RATHER NOT I THINK I MUST GO HOME AT ONCE OH YES SAID FITZPIERS
RESPONDING TO IT ENTIRELY BY CROOKING THEIR LIMBS WRINKLED LIKE AN OLD CRONE'S FACE AND ANTLERED WITH DEAD BRANCHES THAT ROSE ABOVE THE FOLIAGE OF THEIR SUMMITS
HAD ANY OF THEM LOOKED IN UPON HER DURING THOSE MOONLIGHT NIGHTS WHICH PRECEDED THE BURIAL OF HER FATHER
MINGLED WITH BETTER SENTIMENTS MISSUS CHARMOND'S MOBILE SPIRIT WAS SUBJECT TO THESE FIERCE PERIODS OF STRESS AND STORM SHE HAD NEVER SO CLEARLY PERCEIVED TILL NOW THAT HER SOUL
WERE SIMPLE OCCURRENCES WHOSE ORIGIN CONTINUANCE AND LAWS THEY FOREKNEW THEY HAD PLANTED TOGETHER AND TOGETHER THEY HAD FELLED TOGETHER THEY HAD WITH THE RUN OF THE YEARS MENTALLY COLLECTED THOSE REMOTER SIGNS AND SYMBOLS
JOKING WITH THE ROUGH WORK FOLK AND ALL THAT I COULD HAVE STOOD IT
BUT LORD THERE I DON'T MIND EM MYSELF THEM SMALL ONES
TILL VIRTUALLY THE WHOLE SURROUNDING CIRCLE OF FAMILIARS IS CHARGED WITH THE RESERVED ONE'S MOODS AND MEANINGS THIS WAS THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS BETWEEN WINTERBORNE AND HIS NEIGHBORS AFTER HIS STROKE OF ILL LUCK
BUT PARDON ME I SPEAK ROUGHLY AND I CAME TO SPEAK GENTLY TO COAX YOU BEG YOU TO BE MY DAUGHTER'S FRIEND SHE LOVED YOU ONCE MA'AM YOU BEGAN BY LIKING HER THEN YOU DROPPED HER WITHOUT A REASON AND IT HURT HER WARM HEART MORE THAN I CAN TELL YE
NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE FACTORS OF HIS LIFE HAD WORKED OUT A SORRY PRODUCT FOR THOUSANDS HE SAW NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS REGULAR IN HIS DISCOVERY AT HINTOCK OF AN ALTOGETHER EXCEPTIONAL BEING OF THE OTHER SEX WHO FOR NOBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE HAD ANY EXISTENCE
SECURITIES OF VARIOUS SORTS HE UNFOLDED THEM ONE BY ONE PAPERS WORTH SO MUCH MONEY EACH NOW
IT FOLLOWED THAT HE GOT GOOD EXERCISE AND SHE GOT NONE BUT SHE WAS AN HEROIC GIRL AND THOUGH HER OUT STRETCHED HAND WAS CHILL AS A STONE AND HER CHEEKS BLUE AND HER COLD WORSE THAN EVER
AND THE WOMAN TOLD HER TALE UNSKILFULLY FOR WANT OF PRACTICE AS SHE DECLARED MISTER MELBURY WAS STANDING BY AND EXCLAIMED CONTEMPTUOUSLY TELL HER FORTUNE INDEED HER FORTUNE HAS BEEN TOLD BY MEN OF SCIENCE
IF SO AS SHE IS GONE AWAY I MUST SPEAK TO HER AGENT OH NEVER MIND WHOSE TREE IT IS
NEVER WOULD SEE HER OR CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HER AT ALL THOUGH THEIR CREATION HAD SUCH INTERESTING RELATION TO HER LIFE THAT IT WOULD ENCLOSE HER VERY HEART AT A MOMENT WHEN THAT HEART WOULD BEAT IF NOT WITH MORE EMOTIONAL ARDOR
ACROSS THE JAWS A BILLET WHICH THEY DRAGGED FROM A FAGGOT NEAR AT HAND AND IT WAS THEN POSSIBLE TO EXTRACT THE SILK MOUTHFUL FROM THE MONSTER'S BITE CREASED AND PIERCED WITH MANY HOLES BUT NOT TORN FITZPIERS ASSISTED HER TO PUT IT ON AGAIN
THE WOMAN WENT QUICKLY DOWN THE BOX EDGED PATH BETWEEN THE RASPBERRIES AND CURRANTS AND AS SHE WALKED HER WELL DEVELOPED FORM AND GAIT BETRAYED HER INDIVIDUALITY
ON WHICH ACCOUNT AN ENDLESS SHEARING OF THE HEAVY ARMED IVY WAS NECESSARY AND A CONTINUAL LOPPING OF TREES AND SHRUBS IT WAS AN EDIFICE BUILT IN TIMES WHEN HUMAN CONSTITUTIONS WERE DAMP PROOF
MAN TRAPS ARE OF RATHER OMINOUS SIGNIFICANCE WHERE A PERSON OF OUR SEX LIVES ARE THEY NOT GRACE WAS BOUND TO SMILE BUT THAT SIDE OF WOMANLINESS WAS ONE WHICH HER INEXPERIENCE HAD NO GREAT ZEST IN CONTEMPLATING
NOT SO VERY LONG AGO SHE BECAME LOST IN LONG PONDERINGS
NOR I TO HIM YET YOU AND HE COULD SPEAK IN A TONGUE THAT NOBODY ELSE KNEW NOT EVEN MY FATHER THOUGH HE CAME NEAREST KNOWING
HE ACCOMPANIED HER TOWARDS THE SPOT BEING STIMULATED YET FURTHER TO PROCEED WITH THE WORK BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE GROUND WAS CLOSE TO THE WAY SIDE ALONG WHICH GRACE MUST PASS ON HER RETURN FROM HINTOCK HOUSE
WHEN IT WAS READY THE MEN WERE CALLED AND FITZPIERS BEING IN A MOOD TO JOIN SAT DOWN WITH THEM THE LATENT REASON OF HIS LINGERING HERE SO LONG REVEALED ITSELF WHEN THE FAINT CREAKING OF THE JOINTS OF A VEHICLE BECAME AUDIBLE AND ONE OF THE MEN SAID HERE'S HE
THEIRS GREW AS IMPERCEPTIBLY AS THE TREE TWIGS BUDDED
SHE COULD SEE GILES AND CREEDLE TALKING TOGETHER AT THE BACK THE CHARRED SPAR GAD WITH WHICH THE LINES HAD BEEN WRITTEN LAY ON THE GROUND BENEATH THE WALL FEELING PRETTY SURE THAT WINTERBORNE WOULD OBSERVE HER ACTION SHE QUICKLY WENT UP TO THE WALL RUBBED OUT LOSE AND INSERTED KEEP IN ITS STEAD
NO DOUBT YOU FEEL HINTOCK TO BE A GREAT CHANGE AFTER WATERING PLACE LIFE I DO BUT IT IS HOME IT HAS ITS ADVANTAGES AND ITS DISADVANTAGES GRACE WAS THINKING LESS OF THE SOLITUDE THAN OF THE ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES
HAD A RELIEF IN IT WHICH WAS STRONGER THAN HER PRIDE
NO NO MY DEAR MISSUS POYSER CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE SQUIRE STILL CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN POWERS OF PERSUASION YOU MUST NOT OVERWORK YOURSELF
THE HEALTH DRINKING WHEN THE DINNER WAS OVER AND THE FIRST DRAUGHTS FROM THE GREAT CASK OF BIRTHDAY ALE WERE BROUGHT UP ROOM WAS MADE FOR THE BROAD MISTER POYSER AT THE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND TWO CHAIRS WERE PLACED AT THE HEAD
TOO UNLIKE HIM AND EVEN IF NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT THEY MIGHT GET TOO FOND OF EACH OTHER AND THEN THERE COULD BE NOTHING BUT THE MISERY OF PARTING AFTER ALL NO GENTLEMAN OUT OF A BALLAD COULD MARRY A FARMER'S NIECE
WHEN I ASKED HER IF THERE WAS ANY ONE OF HER FAMILY WHOM SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO WHOM SHE COULD OPEN HER MIND SHE SAID WITH A VIOLENT SHUDDER TELL THEM NOT TO COME NEAR ME I WON'T SEE ANY OF THEM
WI INS AN OUTS TO FIT INT EVERYTHING ELSE IF YOU COULD MAKE A PUDDING WI THINKING O THE BATTER IT UD BE EASY GETTING DINNER
THE TIME ULL SEEM LONG HE WAS LOOKING AT HER FONDLY AND HIS STRONG HAND HELD HERS IN ITS GRASP HETTY FELT A SENSE OF PROTECTION IN HIS PRESENCE SHE WAS USED TO IT NOW IF SHE COULD HAVE HAD THE PAST UNDONE AND KNOWN NO OTHER LOVE THAN HER QUIET LIKING FOR ADAM
O NIGHTS WI TWENTY GALLONS O MILK ON MY MIND AND DINGALL ULL TAKE NO MORE BUTTER LET ALONE PAYING FOR IT
BUT ADAM HAD NO SOONER CAUGHT HIS IMAGINATION LEAPING FORWARD IN THIS WAY MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE THAN HE CHECKED HIMSELF A PRETTY BUILDING I'M MAKING WITHOUT EITHER BRICKS OR TIMBER I'M UP THE GARRET A'READY AND HAVEN'T SO MUCH AS DUG THE FOUNDATION
AND IF THE MEETING HAD NO GOOD EFFECT ON HER IT WOULD BE PURE USELESS SUFFERING TO YOU SEVERE SUFFERING I FEAR SHE IS VERY MUCH CHANGED ADAM STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR
OCTOBER SUNSHINE THAN IT HAD IN THE EAGER TIME OF EARLY SPRING AND THE ONE GRAND CHARM IT POSSESSED IN COMMON WITH ALL WIDE STRETCHING WOODLESS REGIONS
BUT THEN THAT'S THE DEEPEST CURSE OF ALL THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BLACKNESS OF IT IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE MY POOR HETTY SHE CAN NEVER BE MY SWEET HETTY AGAIN THE PRETTIEST THING GOD HAD MADE
YOU'RE ABOUT AS NEAR THE RIGHT LANGUAGE AS A PIG'S SQUEAKING IS LIKE A TUNE PLAYED ON A KEY BUGLE WELL I DON'T KNOW
SHE MUST GO AWAY GO WHERE THEY CAN'T FIND HER AFTER THE FIRST ON COMING OF HER GREAT DREAD SOME WEEKS AFTER HER BETROTHAL TO ADAM SHE HAD WAITED AND WAITED IN THE BLIND VAGUE HOPE THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO SET HER FREE FROM HER TERROR BUT SHE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
FOR FEAR YOU SHOULD BE DECEIVING YOURSELF IT'S NEVER ENTERED HIS HEAD THE THOUGHT O MARRYING YOU HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW DURST YOU SAY SO SAID HETTY PAUSING IN HER WALK AND TREMBLING THE TERRIBLE DECISION OF ADAM'S TONE SHOOK HER WITH FEAR
I'VE GOT NO WIFE TO WORM IT OUT OF ME AND THEN RUN OUT AND CACKLE IT IN EVERYBODY'S HEARING IF YOU TRUST A MAN LET HIM BE A BACHELOR LET HIM BE A BACHELOR WELL THEN IT WAS SO FAR SETTLED YESTERDAY THAT I'M TO TAKE THE MANAGEMENT O THE WOODS
ADDED TO THOSE WE ARE SUFFERING UNDER YOU COULD NOT BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU WOULD ENTAIL THE WORST SORROWS ON EVERY ONE WHO LOVES YOU YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF BLIND FURY THAT WOULD LEAVE ALL THE PRESENT EVILS JUST AS THEY WERE
IN THE COURSE OF THINGS WE MAY EXPECT THAT IF I LIVE I SHALL ONE DAY OR OTHER BE YOUR LANDLORD INDEED IT IS ON THE GROUND OF THAT EXPECTATION THAT MY GRANDFATHER HAS WISHED ME TO CELEBRATE THIS DAY AND TO COME AMONG YOU NOW AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS POSITION
THIS DESIRABLE EVENT OF MISSUS POYSER'S COMING DOWNSTAIRS HAPPENED IN THE EARLY PART OF FEBRUARY WHEN SOME MILD WEATHER THAWED THE LAST PATCH OF SNOW ON THE BINTON HILLS
TO AWAIT ITS ARRIVAL AND DIRECT THE WORKMEN THIS LITTLE WALK WAS A REST TO ADAM AND HE WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY UNDER THE CHARM OF THE MOMENT IT WAS SUMMER MORNING IN HIS HEART AND HE SAW HETTY IN THE SUNSHINE A SUNSHINE WITHOUT GLARE
AND SELFISH EVEN A BLASPHEMOUS SPIRIT WHICH REJOICES AND IS THANKFUL OVER THE PAST EVIL THAT HAS BLIGHTED OR CRUSHED ANOTHER BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MADE A SOURCE OF UNFORESEEN GOOD TO OURSELVES
EVERYTHING WAS FORGOTTEN BUT THE PAIN AND ANGER SHE FELT AT ADAM'S WORDS NAY HETTY SAID ADAM IF HE'D CARED FOR YOU RIGHTLY HE'D NEVER HA BEHAVED SO HE TOLD ME HIMSELF HE MEANT NOTHING BY HIS KISSING AND PRESENTS
WHEN ADAM CAME IN SIGHT OF THE GREY TOWN ON THE HILL SIDE AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY TOWARDS THE GREEN VALLEY BELOW FOR THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE OLD THATCHED ROOF NEAR THE UGLY RED MILL THE SCENE LOOKED LESS HARSH IN THE SOFT
IS DINAH MORRIS COME TO EM SIR SETH SAID THEY'D SENT FOR HER NO MISTER POYSER TELLS ME SHE WAS NOT COME WHEN HE LEFT THEY'RE AFRAID THE LETTER HAS NOT REACHED HER
I THANK YOU ALL MY GOOD FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS ARTHUR SAID FOR THE GOOD OPINION OF ME AND THE KIND FEELINGS TOWARDS ME WHICH MISTER POYSER HAS BEEN EXPRESSING ON YOUR BEHALF AND ON HIS OWN AND IT WILL ALWAYS BE MY HEARTIEST WISH TO DESERVE THEM
SO ADAM WAS CONSOLED FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT HE HAD FELT WHEN SETH HAD COME BACK FROM HIS VISIT TO SNOWFIELD AND SAID IT WAS NO USE DINAH'S HEART WASNA TURNED TOWARDS MARRYING
WITH SLANTING RAYS THAT TREMBLE BETWEEN THE DELICATE SHADOWS OF THE LEAVES HE THOUGHT YESTERDAY WHEN HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO HER AS THEY CAME OUT OF CHURCH THAT THERE WAS A TOUCH OF MELANCHOLY KINDNESS IN HER FACE SUCH AS HE HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE
HELD IT FIRMLY BETWEEN HER CLASPED HANDS SAY WHY I SAY YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE
PERHAPS THAT'S THE LAST HYMN BEFORE THEY COME AWAY ADAM THOUGHT I'LL WALK BACK A BIT AND TURN AGAIN TO MEET HER FARTHER OFF THE VILLAGE HE WALKED BACK TILL HE GOT NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE HILL AGAIN
SAID MISSUS POYSER AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN BOWED LOW IN ANSWER TO HETTY'S CURTSY WHILE TOTTY CONSCIOUS OF A PINAFORE STAINED WITH GOOSEBERRY JAM STOOD HIDING HER FACE AGAINST THE CLOCK AND PEEPING ROUND FURTIVELY
AND PART OF A HISTORY OF BABYLON WHICH BARTLE MASSEY HAD LENT HIM HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MANY MORE BOOKS FROM BARTLE MASSEY BUT HE HAD NO TIME FOR READING THE COMMIN PRINT AS LISBETH CALLED IT SO BUSY AS HE WAS WITH FIGURES IN ALL THE LEISURE MOMENTS WHICH HE DID NOT FILL UP WITH EXTRA CARPENTRY
IT IS NOT MY PLACE AT PRESENT TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS I ONLY MEET YOUR GOOD HOPES CONCERNING ME BY TELLING YOU THAT MY OWN HOPES CORRESPOND TO THEM THAT WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM ME I DESIRE TO FULFIL
ADAM PAUSED AND LOOKED AT HETTY WHO WAS PLUCKING THE LEAVES FROM THE FILBERT TREES AND TEARING THEM UP IN HER HAND HER LITTLE PLANS AND PRECONCERTED SPEECHES HAD ALL FORSAKEN HER LIKE AN ILL LEARNT LESSON UNDER THE TERRIBLE AGITATION PRODUCED BY ADAM'S WORDS
BUT I'VE THE MORE REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU CAPTAIN AND TO YOU MISTER IRWINE AND TO ALL MY FRIENDS HERE WHO'VE DRUNK MY HEALTH AND WISHED ME WELL
HITHERTO HE HAD FELT KEENLY THE DANGER THAT SOME OTHER MAN MIGHT STEP IN AND GET POSSESSION OF HETTY'S HEART AND HAND WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS STILL IN A POSITION THAT MADE HIM SHRINK FROM ASKING HER TO ACCEPT HIM EVEN IF HE HAD HAD A STRONG HOPE THAT SHE WAS FOND OF HIM
THE SIGHT OF THEM WOULD GIVE A MAN SOME ENERGY ARTHUR LOST HIMSELF AMONG THE NARROW OPENINGS IN THE FERN WINDING ABOUT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY ISSUE TILL THE TWILIGHT DEEPENED ALMOST TO NIGHT UNDER THE GREAT BOUGHS AND THE HARE LOOKED BLACK AS IT DARTED ACROSS HIS PATH
SO ADAM GOT ON HIS HORSE AGAIN AND RODE TO THE TOWN PUTTING UP AT THE OLD INN AND TAKING A HASTY DINNER THERE IN THE COMPANY OF THE TOO CHATTY LANDLORD FROM WHOSE FRIENDLY QUESTIONS AND REMINISCENCES
BUT I KNOW BETTER NOR THAT I CAN'T HELP THINKING AS YOU'VE BEEN TRUSTING TO HIS LOVING YOU WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY YOU FOR ALL HE'S A GENTLEMAN
AND THINK THERE'S NOBODY BUT ME KNOWS ABOUT THIS AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU AS IF I WAS YOUR BROTHER YOU'RE THE SAME AS EVER TO ME FOR I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'VE DONE ANY WRONG KNOWINGLY HETTY HAD LAID HER HAND ON THE LETTER BUT ADAM DID NOT LOOSE IT TILL HE HAD DONE SPEAKING
THE HIDDEN DREAD IT WAS A BUSY TIME FOR ADAM
HE FORESAW ENOUGH HE'D NO RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT HARM AND SHAME TO HER
HETTY HAD NOT LIKED THE THOUGHT OF GOING TO SNOWFIELD AND FELT NO LONGING TO SEE DINAH SO SHE ONLY SAID IT'S SO FAR OFF UNCLE BUT NOW SHE THOUGHT THIS PROPOSED VISIT WOULD SERVE AS A PRETEXT FOR GOING AWAY SHE WOULD TELL HER AUNT WHEN SHE GOT HOME AGAIN
THE NEGLECTED BEARD OF A MAN JUST RISEN FROM A SICK BED HIS HEAVY BLACK HAIR HANGS OVER HIS FOREHEAD AND THERE IS NO ACTIVE IMPULSE IN HIM WHICH INCLINES HIM TO PUSH IT OFF THAT HE MAY BE MORE AWAKE TO WHAT IS AROUND HIM
PERHAPS THERE WAS NO ONE PRESENT EXCEPT MISTER IRWINE WHO THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPROVED ARTHUR'S GRACEFUL MODE OF PROPOSING HIS GRANDFATHER'S HEALTH THE FARMERS THOUGHT THE YOUNG SQUIRE KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THEY HATED THE OLD SQUIRE AND MISSUS POYSER SAID
LOVE IS A BIG WORD
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE WORLD AND WOMEN AND SOCIAL LIFE AND THAT SORT OF THING AND SUCH AN INCIDENT HAS THE FASCINATION OF THE UNKNOWN FOR ME I KNOW YOU AND I KNEW HER BY SIGHT
I REALLY DO NOT THINK KENNEDY EVEN BY YOUR OWN SHOWING THAT YOU DID THE RIGHT THING BY THAT GIRL
AND THEN THERE FELL SILENCE UPON THAT OLD CHRISTIAN CHURCH A STAGNANT HEAVY SILENCE WHICH CLOSED ROUND KENNEDY AND SHUT HIM IN LIKE WATER ROUND A DROWNING MAN SOME TWO MONTHS AFTERWARDS
YOU SEEM UNEASY FRIEND KENNEDY SAID HE GO ON MAN LIGHT THE CANDLE SAID KENNEDY IMPATIENTLY IT'S VERY STRANGE KENNEDY BUT I COULD NOT IN THE LEAST TELL BY THE SOUND IN WHICH DIRECTION YOU STAND COULD YOU TELL WHERE I AM NO YOU SEEM TO BE ON EVERY SIDE OF ME
RUSTY METAL ORNAMENTS WHICH TO THE UNINITIATED MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO HAVE COME STRAIGHT FROM A DUSTMAN'S BIN BUT WHICH A SPECIALIST WOULD HAVE SPEEDILY RECOGNIZED AS UNIQUE OF THEIR KIND THE PILE OF ODDS AND ENDS IN THE FLAT WICKER WORK BASKET
THE TRAIN HOWEVER IS A FAVOURITE ONE AMONG MANCHESTER BUSINESS MEN WHO ARE RETURNING FROM TOWN FOR IT DOES THE JOURNEY IN FOUR HOURS AND TWENTY MINUTES WITH ONLY THREE STOPPAGES UPON THE WAY
IN EVERYTHING WHICH CONCERNED THE OLD LIFE AND HISTORY OF THE CITY
I DON'T SUPPOSE IN ALL THIS COUNTRY THERE IS A MORE CONTEMPTIBLE LOOKING CREATURE THAN YOU ARE AS YOU SIT THERE WITH THAT DOLLY PINAFORE UPON YOU HE COLOURED UP AT THAT FOR HE WAS A VAIN MAN AND HE WINCED FROM RIDICULE
AND IF YOU ONLY HAD A PULL YOU COULD DO PRETTY NEARLY EVERYTHING YOU WANTED AND NOTHING WOULD HAVE STOPPED THEM IF THEY HAD ONLY STUCK TO CARDS AND NEW YORK BUT THEY MUST NEEDS COME UP ROCHESTER WAY AND FORGE A NAME UPON A CHEQUE
I KNEW SOMETHING OF HIS WAYS AND I WAS AWARE OF THAT PART OF THE MECHANISM WHICH HE AND ALL SUCH SHARPERS USE CONSISTS OF AN ELASTIC DOWN THE ARM WITH A CLIP JUST ABOVE THE WRIST IT IS BY MEANS OF THIS CLIP
OVER THE SIGNATURE OF A WELL KNOWN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATOR WHICH GAVE RISE TO CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION AT THE TIME HE HAD FORMED A HYPOTHESIS WHICH HAD AT LEAST INGENUITY TO RECOMMEND IT
DIVIDES AND SUBDIVIDES A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE YOU GO A HUNDRED YARDS THEY HAD DESCENDED SOME TWENTY FEET FROM THE LEVEL OF THE BYRE
IT WAS TRUE THAT A GANG OF PLATELAYERS WAS THERE AND THAT THEY HAD SEEN NOTHING BUT IT WAS THEIR CUSTOM TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THE METALS AND THE OPEN CARRIAGE DOOR WAS UPON THE FAR SIDE
ONLY ONE OTHER THING HOW DID YOU GET RID OF HER IN THREE WEEKS
I'VE CHASED A GOOD DEAL OF GAME IN MY TIME BUT THERE'S NO CHASE LIKE THAT OF A PRETTY WOMAN THERE WAS THE PIQUANT DIFFICULTY OF IT ALSO FOR AS SHE WAS THE COMPANION OF LADY EMILY ROOD IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE HER ALONE
BURGER PUT HIS LANTERN DOWN ON THE GROUND AND SHADED ITS LIGHT IN ALL DIRECTIONS SAVE ONE BY DRAPING HIS OVERCOAT ROUND IT IT MIGHT EXCITE REMARK IF ANYONE SAW A LIGHT IN THIS LONELY PLACE SAID HE JUST HELP ME TO MOVE THIS BOARDING THE FLOORING WAS LOOSE IN THE CORNER
THE GUARD TURNED THE HANDLE OF THE NEAREST DOOR IN THE CARRIAGE WHICH HE HAD OPENED THERE SAT A SMALL MAN WITH A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH HIS APPEARANCE SEEMS TO HAVE IMPRESSED ITSELF UPON THE GUARD'S MEMORY FOR HE WAS PREPARED AFTERWARDS
THAT I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE HOW YOU SET ABOUT IT FOR EXAMPLE
HE WAS SETTLING DOWN FOR HIS HARVEST AND A RICH ONE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BUT I SOON CHANGED ALL THAT GENTLEMEN SAID I ARE YOU AWARE WHOM YOU ARE PLAYING WITH WHAT'S THAT TO YOU YOU MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
BUT IT IS TRUE THAT THERE WAS ONE PECULIARITY ABOUT THIS UNKNOWN YOUNG MAN WHICH WAS MUCH COMMENTED UPON AT THE TIME IN HIS POCKETS WERE FOUND NO FEWER THAN SIX VALUABLE GOLD WATCHES
I TOOK HIM DOWN RIGHT AWAY TO AN OLD FAMILY FRIEND JOE WILLSON WHO IS AN EXPORTER OF AMERICAN WATCHES AND CLOCKS AND I GOT HIM TO GIVE EDWARD AN AGENCY IN LONDON
THAT THIS WOMAN DID DO SO AND NOW WE HAVE TO FIT IN THE MAN IN THE SMOKING CARRIAGE PRESUMING THAT WE HAVE UP TO THIS POINT RECONSTRUCTED THE TRAGEDY CORRECTLY
WELL KENNEDY THERE ARE TWO THINGS WHICH I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE VERY FOND OF THE ONE IS AN ADVENTURE AND THE OTHER IS AN OBSTACLE TO SURMOUNT THE ADVENTURE MUST BE THE FINDING OF YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS CATACOMB
HE OUTWEIGHED ME EVERY TIME EDWARD HAD KEPT HIMSELF STRAIGHT IN LONDON FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AND HAD DONE SOME BUSINESS WITH HIS AMERICAN WATCHES UNTIL THIS VILLAIN CAME ACROSS HIS PATH ONCE MORE I DID MY BEST
WAS A FAIR INDEX OF THE COMPROMISE BETWEEN STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS IN HIS NATURE OF A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE WAS HIS COMPANION JULIUS BURGER HE CAME OF A CURIOUS BLEND
THAT THEY WITHDRAW FROM THEIR HANDS THE CARDS WHICH THEY DO NOT WANT WHILE THEY SUBSTITUTE OTHER CARDS FROM ANOTHER HIDING PLACE I RECKONED ON IT BEING THERE AND IT WAS HE CURSED ME
THERE STOOD THE FAMOUS RECONSTRUCTION BY KENNEDY OF THE BATHS OF CARACALLA
TO PROPERLY APPRECIATE THE OTHER THEIR COMMON INTERESTS AND PURSUITS HAD BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER AND EACH HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE OTHER'S KNOWLEDGE AND THEN GRADUALLY SOMETHING HAD BEEN ADDED TO THIS KENNEDY HAD BEEN AMUSED BY THE FRANKNESS AND SIMPLICITY OF HIS RIVAL
DISCLOSED A REMARKABLE STATE OF AFFAIRS THE SMOKING CARRIAGE IN WHICH THE SHORT RED FACED MAN
I LIKED HER AND WELL YOU SAY YOU'VE SEEN HER YOU KNOW HOW CHARMING SHE COULD LOOK BUT STILL I AM WILLING TO ADMIT LOOKING BACK THAT I COULD NEVER HAVE REALLY LOVED HER THEN MY DEAR KENNEDY WHY DID YOU DO IT THE ADVENTURE OF THE THING HAD A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH IT
I MADE HIM UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT OUR MOTHER'S HEART WAS BEING BROKEN IN ANY CASE AND THAT I HAD SET FIRM ON THE POINT THAT I WOULD RATHER SEE HIM IN ROCHESTER GAOL THAN IN
THEN AGAIN HER OLD FATHER TURNED UP AT THE HOTEL IN LONDON AND THERE WAS A SCENE AND THE WHOLE THING BECAME SO UNPLEASANT THAT REALLY THOUGH I MISSED HER DREADFULLY AT FIRST I WAS VERY GLAD TO SLIP OUT OF IT
THE POLICE HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN SHOWING THAT SUCH A THEORY WOULD NOT COVER THE FACTS BUT THEY WERE UNPREPARED IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE TO ADVANCE ANY ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION THERE WAS A LETTER IN THE DAILY GAZETTE
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE A MARY JANE OF YOURSELF WHILE I CAN HELP IT IF NOTHING BUT THAT DISGUISE STANDS BETWEEN YOU AND A GAOL THEN TO GAOL YOU SHALL GO THAT WAS THE WAY TO MANAGE HIM I FELT MY ADVANTAGE AT ONCE
AND THE DARKNESS IS SOMETHING DREADFUL I TRIED IT ONCE FOR AN EXPERIMENT LET US TRY IT AGAIN
WITH A SMALL SALARY AND A FIFTEEN PER CENT COMMISSION ON ALL BUSINESS HIS MANNER AND APPEARANCE WERE SO GOOD THAT HE WON THE OLD MAN OVER AT ONCE AND WITHIN A WEEK HE WAS SENT OFF TO LONDON WITH A CASE FULL OF SAMPLES
AND I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN APPEND IT IN HIS OWN WORDS WHATEVER MAY BE THE TRUTH SAID HE IT MUST DEPEND UPON SOME BIZARRE AND RARE COMBINATION OF EVENTS
OVER THE CRACKED BROWN WALLS IN EVERY DIRECTION WERE THE BLACK OPENINGS OF PASSAGES WHICH RADIATED FROM THIS COMMON CENTRE I WANT YOU TO FOLLOW ME CLOSELY MY FRIEND SAID BURGER DO NOT LOITER
AND I CAN SUPPLY IT MISS SAUNDERSON WAS ENGAGED TO A POOR UNGAINLY DEVIL OF A STUDENT AND HIS NAME WAS JULIUS BURGER THERE WAS A RUSTLE SOMEWHERE THE VAGUE SOUND OF A FOOT STRIKING A STONE
THEIR FOOTSTEPS SOUNDED LOUD AND CRISP UPON THE ROUGH STONE PAVING OF THE DISAPPOINTING ROAD WHICH IS ALL THAT IS LEFT OF THE MOST FAMOUS HIGHWAY OF THE WORLD A PEASANT OR TWO GOING HOME FROM THE WINE SHOP AND A FEW CARTS OF COUNTRY PRODUCE COMING UP TO ROME
WOULD YOU GIVE ME AN ANSWER I WONDER THIS NEW CATACOMB IS A VERY INTIMATE THING TO ME AND I SHOULD CERTAINLY EXPECT SOME SIGN OF CONFIDENCE IN RETURN
THE EXPRESS BEING FIVE MINUTES LATE AT RUGBY THE ATTENTION OF THE STATION OFFICIALS WAS DRAWN TO THE FACT THAT THE DOOR OF ONE OF THE FIRST CLASS CARRIAGES WAS OPEN AN EXAMINATION OF THAT COMPARTMENT AND OF ITS NEIGHBOUR
WERE THE ONLY THINGS WHICH THEY MET
YOU CAN REMEMBER THAT THE APPLE YOU STOLE FROM YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S TREE WAS ALWAYS SWEETER THAN THAT WHICH FELL FROM YOUR OWN AND THEN I FOUND THAT SHE CARED FOR ME
WE CAN THEN TEST THIS EXPLANATION BY ANY FRESH FACTS WHICH MAY ARISE IF THEY ALL FIT INTO THEIR PLACES THE PROBABILITY IS THAT WE ARE UPON THE RIGHT TRACK
BUT HIS ANGER AGAINST ME AND MY RESENTMENT TOWARDS HIM HAD BOTH FOR THE MOMENT BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN THIS SUDDEN TRAGEDY IT WAS HE WHO FIRST REALIZED THE SITUATION THE TRAIN WAS FOR SOME REASON GOING VERY SLOWLY AT THE MOMENT
SO WE NEED HAVE NO HESITATION IN POSTULATING SUCH EVENTS IN OUR EXPLANATION IN THE ABSENCE OF DATA WE MUST ABANDON THE ANALYTIC OR SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF INVESTIGATION AND MUST APPROACH IT
SUPPOSE WE START IN AN HOUR WE MUST BE VERY CAREFUL TO KEEP THE MATTER TO OURSELVES
WHOM HE HAD TWICE TRIED TO KILL HE SAID TO THE ABBOT
THE NEWS WAS IN EVERYBODY'S MOUTH THAT ANNA HAD SENT FOR CORN AND HAD MADE THE LOAF OF WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN AT THE STRAWBERRY BEDS AND THEN MORE DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED AND THIS RUMOUR WAS SUCCEEDED BY ANOTHER ONE THAT STANA HAD PROCURED SOME FLAX
SAID SHE FOR YOU MUST HAVE SOME SUPPER I CANNOT LET YOU GO HUNGRY TO BED THEN BENDING OVER THE BASKET SHE WHISPERED SOME MAGIC WORDS AND INSTANTLY A TABLE COVERED WITH FRUITS AND CAKES STOOD ON THE GROUND BEFORE THEM
AND IF YOU CAN HELP ME YOU SHALL HAVE IN RETURN ANYTHING YOU ASK FOR THE OLD WOMAN STOOD THINKING FOR A LITTLE THEN SHE DREW SOMETHING FROM THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS AND UNDOING A NUMBER OF WRAPPINGS
AND A GOOD LOOKING BOY TOO AND PLEASANT SO THAT CUSTOMERS WERE TAKEN BY HIM WELL WELL SO GOES THE WORLD BUT WHERE IS YOUR SON ASKED JEM WITH A TREMBLING VOICE HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS REPLIED THE MAN
AND NOT LONG AFTER SHE CAME ONE DAY HASTILY INTO THE ROOM AND FOUND HER HUSBAND WEEPING WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED THE MATTER SAID HE YES WHY ARE YOU WEEPING BECAUSE REPLIED HALFMAN
OH HOW CAN I STOP IT ASKED HE WILL YOU HELP ME YES I WILL REPLIED THE OGRESS THANK YOU THANK YOU CRIED HALFMAN KISSING HER ON THE FOREHEAD
AND FOUND A LARGE PIT LIKE A WELL FILLED WITH HONEY UP TO THE BRIM THIS IS BETTER THAN FIREWOOD SAID THEY IT WILL BRING US MORE MONEY AND AS YOU HAVE FOUND IT HASSEBU IT IS YOU WHO MUST GO INSIDE
WHO MADE HIMSELF A COMFORTABLE BED UNDER THE APPLE TREE AND PREPARED HIMSELF TO SLEEP TOWARDS MIDNIGHT HE AWOKE
FROM THAT DAY THINGS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE AND EVERY MORNING CROWDS PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE THE EMPEROR COMPLAINING OF THE ROBBERIES MURDERS AND OTHER CRIMES THAT WERE COMMITTED NIGHTLY IN THE STREETS
THE HEADLESS DWARFS THERE WAS ONCE A MINISTER WHO SPENT HIS WHOLE TIME IN TRYING TO FIND A SERVANT WHO WOULD UNDERTAKE TO RING THE CHURCH BELLS AT MIDNIGHT IN ADDITION TO ALL HIS OTHER DUTIES
HAVE WHISPERED IN THE WOOD WE HAVE SUNG IN THE WATERS BUT NOW WE WISH TO TELL YOU A STORY WHICH YOU KNOW WITHOUT KNOWING IT IN THE SPEECH OF MEN AND A SECOND CUSHION FELL DOWN LET THEM TAKE THEIR SILLINESS HOME
THEN SHE CHANGED HERSELF BACK INTO A PEA HEN AND THE WHOLE NINE FLEW AWAY AS SOON AS THE SUN ROSE THE PRINCE ENTERED THE PALACE AND HELD OUT THE APPLE TO HIS FATHER WHO WAS REJOICED TO SEE IT AND PRAISED HIS YOUNGEST SON HEARTILY FOR HIS CLEVERNESS
AND LEAVE THE EGGSHELLS IN IT AS LONG AS YOU DO THAT NO EVIL CAN COME TO HER SO GUARD THIS TREASURE AS THE APPLE OF YOUR EYE AND TEACH YOUR DAUGHTER TO DO SO LIKEWISE THEN KISSING THE BABY THREE TIMES SHE MOUNTED HER COACH AND DROVE AWAY
YOU WILL INVITE ME TO BE GODMOTHER TO THE PRINCESS AND THIS IS HOW YOU MUST SEND THE INVITATION HIDDEN IN THE CRADLE YOU WILL FIND A GOOSE'S WING THROW THIS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND I WILL BE WITH YOU DIRECTLY
AND MARCHED STRAIGHT OFF TO THE CASTLE BUT DIRECTLY THEY TOOK UP THEIR POSITION VIRGILIUS GIRDED THEM ABOUT WITH A GREAT RIVER SO THAT THEY COULD NEITHER MOVE HAND NOR FOOT THEN HAILING THE EMPEROR HE OFFERED HIM PEACE AND ASKED FOR HIS FRIENDSHIP
AND THE STEPMOTHER WHO WAS WATCHING TOOK THEM AWAY AND DUG A HOLE IN THE CORNER OF THE PALACE UNDER THE WINDOWS OF THE EMPEROR AND PUT THEM IN IT
AND POURED ITS CONTENTS INTO A SILVER BOWL WHICH SHE SET BEFORE JEM THERE MY BOY SAID SHE EAT THIS SOUP AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE EVERYTHING WHICH PLEASED YOU SO MUCH ABOUT ME AND YOU SHALL BE A CLEVER COOK TOO BUT THE REAL HERB
THEN VIRGILIUS DREW THE BOLT
THE OGRESS WAS SILENT BUT STUCK HER STAFF HARD IN THE EARTH AND THE EARTH OPENED AND THE BOY APPEARED AND SAID DEAR FATHER HAVE YOU COME TOO AND HIS FATHER CLASPED HIM IN HIS ARMS
AND THEN GO AND COVER HER DAUGHTERS WITH A WHITE CLOTH AFTER THAT SHE LAY DOWN AND WAS SOON SNORING LOUDLY WHEN HALFMAN WAS QUITE SURE SHE WAS SOUND ASLEEP HE TOOK THE RED CLOTH FROM HIS BROTHERS AND PUT IT ON THE GIRLS
WHICH HALF COVERED THEIR FACES AND COMPLETELY HID THEIR GOLDEN HAIR AND THE STARS ON THEIR FOREHEADS AND LED THEM TO THE COURT BY THE TIME THEY ARRIVED THERE IT WAS MIDDAY AND THE FISHERMAN AND HIS CHARGES WENT UP TO AN OFFICIAL WHO WAS STANDING ABOUT
I WILL LET DOWN A ROPE AND IF YOU TIE IT TIGHTLY ROUND YOU I WILL DRAW IT UP ALL RIGHT RETURNED THE OGRESS FASTENING THE ROPE WHICH HALFMAN LET DOWN NOW PULL ME UP
AND INFORMED THE MINISTER THAT HE WISHED TO BREAK HIS BOND OF SERVICE AS HOWEVER HE DID NOT CLAIM ANY WAGES THE MINISTER MADE NO OBJECTIONS BUT ALLOWED HIM TO DO AS HE WISHED SO HANS WENT HIS WAY BOUGHT HIMSELF A LARGE HOUSE AND MARRIED A YOUNG WIFE
BUT OUT OF ONE THEY SHALL MAKE A BED FOR ME AND OUT OF THE OTHER ONE FOR YOU AND WITH THIS THE EMPRESS WAS FORCED TO BE CONTENT
SO THAT THEY BELIEVED THAT THE GREAT RIVER OF BABYLON WAS FLOWING THROUGH THE HALL AND THAT THEY MUST SWIM FOR THEIR LIVES SO LEAVING THEM TO PLUNGE AND LEAP LIKE FROGS AND FISHES VIRGILIUS TOOK THE PRINCESS IN HIS ARMS
THERE WAS A SOUND OF PEOPLE COMING THROUGH THE COURTYARD AND THE MEASURED TRAMP OF SOLDIERS THIS WAS THE KING OF THE SNAKES COMING IN STATE TO HIS PALACE THEY ENTERED THE HALL
YET HE FELT A KIND OF CALM THAT WAS QUITE NEW TO HIM
KEEP A SHARP EYE ON JEM AND SO IT HAPPENED FOR ONE DAY AN OLD WOMAN CAME AND BOUGHT A LOT OF THINGS MORE THAN SHE COULD CARRY SO MY WIFE BEING A KINDLY SOUL LENT HER THE BOY AND WE HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE
WHO WAS KING OF THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY DECLARE WAR AGAINST THE EMPEROR AND BESIEGE SOME OF THE FRONTIER TOWNS WITH A LARGE ARMY THIS TIME HER SCHEME WAS SUCCESSFUL THE YOUNG EMPEROR SPRANG UP IN WRATH THE MOMENT HE HEARD THE NEWS AND VOWED THAT NOTHING
FETCH ME SOME WATER I AM DYING OF THIRST THE PRINCE WHO WAS VERY TENDER HEARTED BROUGHT SOME WATER AT ONCE AND PUSHED IT THROUGH A HOLE IN THE BARREL AND AS HE DID SO ONE OF THE IRON HOOPS BURST
INSTEAD OF BEING A HELP AND PROTECTION TO THE CHILD AND HIS MOTHER ROBBED THEM OF THEIR LANDS AND MONEY AND THE WIDOW FEARING THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE THE BOY'S LIFE ALSO SENT HIM AWAY TO SPAIN THAT HE MIGHT STUDY IN THE GREAT UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO
OR SHALL WE FOLLOW THE RUNAWAYS AND THE HORSE REPLIED WHETHER YOU EAT OR DON'T EAT DRINK OR DON'T DRINK FOLLOW THEM OR STAY AT HOME MATTERS NOTHING NOW FOR YOU CAN NEVER NEVER CATCH THEM
OH BROTHER ASKED THE PRINCE TELL ME IF YOU CAN WHERE THE DRAGON EMPEROR LIVES THE MAN TOLD HIM WHERE HE WOULD FIND THE PALACE AND HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE HIM TO GET THERE AND THE PRINCE THANKED HIM AND FOLLOWED HIS DIRECTIONS
WHOSE BRIDE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF ALL AND ALSO THE PRETTIEST AND MY BROTHERS WERE FILLED WITH ENVY AND LEFT ME TO DROWN IN A BROOK BUT I WAS SAVED BY A FISH WHO SHOWED ME HOW TO GET OUT NOW YOU ARE A JUDGE WHO DID WELL
AT THE END OF THREE DAYS SHE COULD DO EVERYTHING AS WELL AS IF SHE HAD CLEANED POTS AND SWEPT ROOMS ALL HER LIFE ONE MORNING DOTTERINE WAS BUSY SCOURING A WOODEN TUB WHEN A NOBLE LADY HAPPENED TO PASS THROUGH THE VILLAGE
AND TO GO ROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MEN WERE ALL AT THEIR WORK THIS MORNING EVERYONE WAS IN HIS PLACE EXCEPT HANS AND NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM NINE O'CLOCK CAME AND NO HANS
AND WHATSOEVER HE WAS TAUGHT HE DID NOT LEARN IT HIS MOTHER NEVER WISHED HIM TO DO ANYTHING HE DID NOT LIKE SO SHE SAID WELL STAY AT HOME MY SON AND HE STAYED AT HOME EATING AND SLEEPING
WHEN MARK SAW VASSILI HE FLEW INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE WITH HIS WIFE HOW DARED YOU MARRY MY DAUGHTER WITHOUT MY CONSENT HE ASKED I ONLY CARRIED OUT YOUR ORDERS SAID SHE HERE IS YOUR LETTER MARK READ IT
OH SHE SHRIEKED WITH RAGE YOU HAVE KILLED MY DAUGHTERS AND MY HUSBAND AND ALL THE MEN BELONGING TO ME HOW CAN I GET AT YOU TO AVENGE MYSELF OH THAT IS EASY ENOUGH SAID HALFMAN
HE WILL IN THE END GET THE CHOICE OF ANY HORSE AS A PRESENT FROM THE OLD WOMAN BUT IF HE FAILS TO KEEP THE FOAL AND ITS MOTHER SAFE ON ANY ONE OF THE THREE NIGHTS HIS HEAD WILL PAY THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE WATCHED TILL THE DRAGON LEFT THE HOUSE
AND LAID THEIR WHITE CLOTH OVER HIS BROTHERS NEXT HE DREW THEIR SCARLET CAPS FROM THEIR HEADS AND EXCHANGED THEM FOR THE VEILS WHICH THE OGRE'S DAUGHTERS WERE WEARING THIS WAS HARDLY DONE
IF IT WASN'T APPENDICITIS INFLUENZA MAYBE WHAT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTIETH STREET
WELL THEN DON'T SPOIL IT IF I ENJOY GOING AROUND TELLING PEOPLE GUILELESSLY THAT I THINK I'M A GENIUS LET ME DO IT YOU'RE GETTING A REPUTATION FOR BEING ECCENTRIC SAID ALEC LAUGHING IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN
THEY WALKED ALONG AND HE REALIZED SLOWLY HOW MUCH SHE HAD TOLD HIM NEVER IN LOVE SHE SEEMED SUDDENLY A DAUGHTER OF LIGHT ALONE
IF YOU ASK ME CRIED PHYLLIS QUICKLY OF COURSE I DO SAID BURNE FEEBLY
TELL THAT TO SOMEBODY ELSE SCOFFED AMORY YOU KNOW YOU'RE PERFECTLY EFFULGENT HE ASKED HER THE ONE THING THAT HE KNEW MIGHT EMBARRASS HER IT WAS THE REMARK
OH NO AMORY PROTESTED HE WORKED TOO HARD FOR THAT I IMAGINE THAT WHEN HE DIED HE WAS A BROKEN DOWN MAN AND THE GREAT SAINTS HAVEN'T BEEN STRONG HALF OF THEM HAVE WELL EVEN GRANTING THAT I DON'T THINK HEALTH HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH GOODNESS OF COURSE
ADAM PROBABLY TOLD THE BORE ALL THE THINGS HE THOUGHT ABOUT AT NIGHT WHEN THE LOCUSTS SANG IN THE SANDY GRASS AND HE MUST HAVE REMARKED PATRONIZINGLY
UNCLE HAD ONLY PAID HUNDRED A MONTH FOR WHOLE GREAT BIG HOUSE IN MINNEAPOLIS QUESTION WERE THE STAIRS ON THE LEFT OR RIGHT AS YOU CAME IN ANYWAY IN TWELVE UNIVEE THEY WERE STRAIGHT BACK AND TO THE LEFT WHAT A DIRTY RIVER
HE SAW HER THAT WINTER IN PHILADELPHIA ENTERTAINING A HOUSEFUL OF MEN FOR AN EVENING WHEN HE KNEW SHE HAD NOT A SERVANT IN THE HOUSE EXCEPT THE LITTLE COLORED GIRL GUARDING THE BABIES OVERHEAD HE SAW ONE OF THE GREATEST LIBERTINES IN THAT CITY
OH CLUBS INJURIOUS TO PRINCETON DEMOCRACY COST A LOT DRAW SOCIAL LINES TAKE TIME THE REGULAR LINE YOU GET SOMETIMES FROM DISAPPOINTED SOPHOMORES
YOU'RE A SLAVE A BOUND HELPLESS SLAVE TO ONE THING IN THE WORLD YOUR IMAGINATION YOU CERTAINLY INTEREST ME IF THIS ISN'T BORING YOU GO ON
THE YOUNGER PROFESSORS THE ILLITERATE ATHLETES LIKE LANGUEDUC THINK HE'S GETTING ECCENTRIC BUT THEY JUST SAY GOOD OLD BURNE HAS GOT SOME QUEER IDEAS IN HIS HEAD AND PASS ON THE PHARISEE CLASS GEE THEY RIDICULE HIM UNMERCIFULLY
THE QUERULOUS WORRY AS TO WHETHER SOME ONE ISN'T LEANING ON YOU A MAN DECIDING NOT TO GIVE HIS SEAT TO A WOMAN HATING HER FOR IT THE WOMAN HATING HIM FOR NOT DOING IT AT WORST A SQUALID PHANTASMAGORIA OF BREATH
I DIDN'T FEEL AS THOUGH I WERE SPEAKING ALOUD BUT I LOVE YOU OR ADORE YOU OR WORSHIP YOU THERE YOU GO RUNNING THROUGH YOUR CATALOGUE OF EMOTIONS IN FIVE SECONDS HE SMILED UNWILLINGLY
AND ARE TRYING TO LIVE UP TO THEM FOR INSTANCE YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING THAT YOU ARE A SLAVE TO HIGH BALLS BUT I AM POTENTIALLY
OVER HER GRAY AND VELVET DRESS UNDER HER MOLTEN BEATEN HAIR COLOR OF ROSE IN MOCK DISTRESS FLUSHES AND FADES AND MAKES HER FAIR FILLS THE AIR FROM HER TO HIM
BROWSING IN HER LIBRARY AMORY FOUND A TATTERED GRAY BOOK OUT OF WHICH FELL A YELLOW SHEET
HOW HE LOVED TO DO ANY SORT OF THING WITH CLARA SHOPPING WITH HER WAS A RARE EPICUREAN DREAM IN EVERY STORE WHERE SHE HAD EVER TRADED SHE WAS WHISPERED ABOUT AS THE BEAUTIFUL MISSUS PAGE
WONDER WHAT HUMBIRD'S BODY LOOKED LIKE NOW IF HE HIMSELF HADN'T BEEN BAYONET INSTRUCTOR HE'D HAVE GONE UP TO LINE THREE MONTHS SOONER PROBABLY BEEN KILLED WHERE'S THE DARNED BELL
SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN FRESHMEN AND WILD FRESHMEN WITH AMORY SOME WERE IN THE CLASS BELOW
NOT A BIT OF WILL I'M A SLAVE TO MY EMOTIONS TO MY LIKES TO MY HATRED OF BOREDOM TO MOST OF MY DESIRES YOU ARE NOT SHE BROUGHT ONE LITTLE FIST DOWN ONTO THE OTHER
RATHER EMBARRASSED HIM WHEN SHE TRIED TO READ NEW INTERESTS INTO HIM FOR THE BENEFIT OF WHAT OTHER ADORERS WERE PRESENT HE FELT AS IF A POLITE BUT INSISTENT STAGE MANAGER WERE ATTEMPTING TO MAKE HIM GIVE A NEW INTERPRETATION OF A PART HE HAD CONNED FOR YEARS
THEN SHE BROKE INTO A RUN AND HER RAISED VOICE FLOATED BACK TO HIM AS HE FOLLOWED MY PRECIOUS BABIES WHICH I MUST GO BACK AND SEE SHE WAS THE ONLY GIRL HE EVER KNEW WITH WHOM HE COULD UNDERSTAND HOW ANOTHER MAN MIGHT BE PREFERRED
AND WHEN HE HAD TALKED FOR FIVE MINUTES AMORY KNEW THAT THIS KEEN ENTHUSIASM HAD IN IT NO QUALITY OF DILETTANTISM THE INTENSE POWER AMORY FELT LATER IN BURNE HOLIDAY DIFFERED FROM THE ADMIRATION HE HAD HAD FOR HUMBIRD
BUT OLD MONOTONY IS THERE ENDLESS AVENUES OF RAIN OH MIGHT I RISE AGAIN MIGHT I THROW OFF THE HEAT OF THAT OLD WINE SEE THE NEW MORNING MASS THE SKY WITH FAIRY TOWERS LINE ON LINE
WHAT ACTUAL FACT WHY SPIRIT OF REFORM AND ALL THAT BURNE HOLIDAY IS BEHIND IT THE CLUB PRESIDENTS ARE HOLDING A MEETING TO NIGHT TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND A JOINT MEANS OF COMBATING IT WELL WHAT'S THE IDEA OF THE THING
BURNE WAS DRAWING FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE WORLD ABOUT HIM HE RESIGNED THE VICE PRESIDENCY OF THE SENIOR CLASS AND TOOK TO READING AND WALKING AS ALMOST HIS ONLY PURSUITS HE VOLUNTARILY ATTENDED GRADUATE LECTURES IN PHILOSOPHY AND BIOLOGY
THEY DON'T THEY JUST WANT THE FUN OF EATING IT ALL OVER AGAIN THE MATRON DOESN'T WANT TO REPEAT HER GIRLHOOD SHE WANTS TO REPEAT HER HONEYMOON
AND AROUND SMALL TABLES AT THE NASSAU INN
IT WAS SOME DISGUST THAT MEN HAD FOR WOMEN WHO WERE TIRED AND POOR IT WAS DIRTIER THAN ANY BATTLE FIELD HE HAD SEEN
I JUST READ YOUR EDITORIAL GOOD BOY DIDN'T KNOW YOU STOOPED THAT LOW JESSE YOU STARTLED ME HOW SO
BUT I MEAN THE MASS OF HIS WORK HE'S TREMENDOUS LIKE TOLSTOI THEY BOTH LOOK THINGS IN THE FACE AND SOMEHOW DIFFERENT AS THEY ARE STAND FOR SOMEWHAT THE SAME THINGS YOU HAVE ME STUMPED BURNE AMORY ADMITTED I'VE READ ANNA KARENINA
OH MODERATELY WELL BURNE'S A DAMN GOOD TALKER AND SO OBVIOUSLY SINCERE THAT YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE WITH HIM IT'S SO EVIDENT THAT RESIGNING FROM HIS CLUB MEANS SO MUCH MORE TO HIM THAN PREVENTING IT DOES TO US THAT I FELT FUTILE WHEN I ARGUED
INTO THE QUIET FACES AT ITS EDGE SO SHE CAST HER LIGHTS AND SHADOWS AROUND THE ROOMS THAT HELD HER
A GHOST CAN NEVER GET YOU IN A BEDROOM GO ON S'POSE YOU THINK THERE'S MAYBE A GHOST IN YOUR BEDROOM WHAT MEASURES DO YOU TAKE ON GETTING HOME AT NIGHT DEMANDED AMORY INTERESTED
HIS ENTITY DROPPED OUT OF HER PLANE AND HE LONGED ONLY TO TOUCH HER DRESS WITH ALMOST THE REALIZATION THAT JOSEPH MUST HAVE HAD OF MARY'S ETERNAL SIGNIFICANCE BUT QUITE MECHANICALLY HE HEARD HIMSELF SAYING
OF COURSE I PEOPLED THE WOODS WITH EVERYTHING GHASTLY JUST LIKE YOU DO DON'T YOU I DO AMORY ADMITTED WELL I BEGAN ANALYZING IT
THROUGH EARLY MARCH HE TOOK TO GOING TO PHILADELPHIA FOR WEEK ENDS ALMOST ALWAYS THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE THERE AND SHE SEEMED NOT ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM ALONE
BUT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM THEY COULD MAKE THEM SOUND LIKE NOTHING WHATEVER THEY GAVE HER A SORT OF INNOCENT ATTENTION AND THE BEST SMILES MANY OF THEM HAD SMILED FOR LONG THERE WERE FEW TEARS IN CLARA BUT PEOPLE SMILED MISTY EYED AT HER
BUT IT DOES REPRESENT SUCCESS HERE IN A GENERAL WAY WELL I SUPPOSE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF EVERY CLASS HERE ARE BLONDS ARE REALLY LIGHT YET TWO THIRDS OF EVERY SENIOR COUNCIL ARE LIGHT WE LOOKED AT PICTURES OF TEN YEARS OF THEM MIND YOU
QUITE SUBMERGED IN HIS BROTHER'S PERSONALITY
HOW MUCH IT WAS WORTH WHILE BEING A DIPLOMATIC AUTOCRAT AROUND HIS CLUB ON PROSPECT AVENUE AND BASKING IN THE HIGH LIGHTS OF CLASS OFFICE IT WAS DISTINCTLY THROUGH THE CHANNELS OF ARISTOCRACY THAT BURNE FOUND HIS WAY AMORY THROUGH KERRY
THE BED REQUIRES DIFFERENT TACTICS LET THE BED ALONE AS YOU VALUE YOUR REASON IF THERE IS A GHOST IN THE ROOM AND THAT'S ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE TIME IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNDER THE BED WELL
A PETTY CONSUMMATION OF HIMSELF AND LIKE A SOMBRE BACKGROUND LAY THAT INCIDENT OF THE SPRING BEFORE THAT FILLED HALF HIS NIGHTS WITH A DREARY TERROR AND MADE HIM UNABLE TO PRAY
SHE WAS VERY DEVOUT ALWAYS HAD BEEN AND GOD KNOWS WHAT HEIGHTS SHE ATTAINED AND WHAT STRENGTH SHE DREW DOWN TO HERSELF WHEN SHE KNELT AND BENT HER GOLDEN HAIR INTO THE STAINED GLASS LIGHT
AMORY SIGHED AND DECIDED TO GO AS A FAVOR CLARA SHE WAS IMMEMORIAL
GOOD LORD TOM YOU USED TO STAND OUT AGAINST PEOPLE SUCCESS HAS COMPLETELY CONVENTIONALIZED YOU TOM GREW RATHER ANNOYED WHAT'S HE TRYING TO DO BE EXCESSIVELY HOLY NO NOT LIKE ANYBODY YOU'VE EVER SEEN
DON'T ASK ME QUESTION DON'T YOU CARE
BUT THOUGHT THAT BURNE AND FRED WERE TWO VARSITY SPORTS SHOWING THEIR GIRL A COLLEGIATE TIME PHYLLIS'S FEELINGS AS SHE WAS PARADED BY THE HARVARD AND PRINCETON STANDS WHERE SAT DOZENS OF HER FORMER DEVOTEES CAN BE IMAGINED SHE TRIED TO WALK A LITTLE AHEAD
HE IS COME REPEATED MAGUA BENDING HIS HEAD WITH THE DIGNITY OF AN EASTERN PRINCE THE CHIEF EXTENDED HIS ARM AND TAKING THE OTHER BY THE WRIST THEY ONCE MORE EXCHANGED FRIENDLY SALUTATIONS
WHO ARE NOT OUR FRIENDS AND THEY FILL THEM WITH LIES IT CANNOT BE SEE HE HAS BID ME WHO AM A MAN THAT KNOWS THE ART OF HEALING TO GO TO HIS CHILDREN
HE HAD NOT LONG OCCUPIED THE SEAT WISELY TAKEN A LITTLE IN THE SHADE WHEN ANOTHER OF THE ELDER WARRIORS WHO SPOKE THE FRENCH LANGUAGE ADDRESSED HIM MY CANADA FATHER DOES NOT FORGET HIS CHILDREN SAID THE CHIEF
CRIED CORA STOPPING UNEXPECTEDLY ON A LEDGE OF ROCK THAT OVERHUNG A DEEP PRECIPICE AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE MOUNTAIN KILL ME IF THOU WILT DETESTABLE HURON I WILL GO NO FURTHER
HE LOOKS TO SEE THAT NO ENEMIES ARE ON HIS TRAIL THE CANOE OF A DEAD WARRIOR WILL NOT FLOAT ON THE HORICAN RETURNED THE SAVAGE GLOOMILY HIS EARS ARE OPEN TO THE DELAWARES
FEW MEN EXHIBIT GREATER DIVERSITY OR IF WE MAY SO EXPRESS IT GREATER ANTITHESIS OF CHARACTER THAN THE NATIVE WARRIOR OF NORTH AMERICA IN WAR HE IS DARING
HAS MY FRIEND FOUND THE MOOSE THE YOUNG MEN STAGGER UNDER THEIR BURDENS RETURNED MAGUA LET REED THAT BENDS GO ON THE HUNTING PATH HE WILL MEET THEM A DEEP AND AWFUL SILENCE SUCCEEDED THE UTTERANCE OF THE FORBIDDEN NAME
PROHIBITED A MORE OPEN EXPRESSION OF HIS ADMIRATION OF A WITTICISM THAT WAS PERFECTLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO HIS HEARERS HE CONTINUED IT IS NOT PRUDENT FOR ANY ONE OF MY PROFESSION TO BE TOO FAMILIAR WITH THOSE HE HAS TO INSTRUCT
LEANED AGAINST A NEIGHBORING SAPLING THE EYE OF THE HUNTER OR SCOUT WHICHEVER HE MIGHT BE WAS SMALL QUICK KEEN AND RESTLESS ROVING WHILE HE SPOKE ON EVERY SIDE OF HIM AS IF IN QUEST OF GAME
LISTEN HAWKEYE AND YOUR EAR SHALL DRINK NO LIE TIS WHAT MY FATHERS HAVE SAID AND WHAT THE MOHICANS HAVE DONE HE HESITATED A SINGLE INSTANT
AND LEAPING THE HEADS OF A ROW OF CHILDREN HE GAINED AT ONCE THE EXTERIOR AND SAFER SIDE OF THE FORMIDABLE ARRAY THE ARTIFICE WAS ANSWERED BY A HUNDRED VOICES RAISED IN IMPRECATIONS AND THE WHOLE OF THE EXCITED MULTITUDE BROKE FROM THEIR ORDER
HE ALSO BORE A KNIFE IN A GIRDLE OF WAMPUM LIKE THAT WHICH CONFINED THE SCANTY GARMENTS OF THE INDIAN BUT NO TOMAHAWK HIS MOCCASINS WERE ORNAMENTED AFTER THE GAY FASHION OF THE NATIVES
THE BROOK WAS IRREGULAR IN ITS WIDTH SOMETIMES SHOOTING THROUGH NARROW FISSURES IN THE ROCKS AND AT OTHERS SPREADING OVER ACRES OF BOTTOM LAND FORMING LITTLE AREAS THAT MIGHT BE TERMED PONDS
NO GAP HAD BEEN LEFT BETWEEN SHOULDER AND SHOULDER THAT WAS NOT NOW FILLED WITH THE DARK LINEAMENTS OF SOME EAGER AND CURIOUS HUMAN COUNTENANCE IN THE MEANTIME THE MORE AGED CHIEFS IN THE CENTER COMMUNED WITH EACH OTHER IN SHORT AND BROKEN SENTENCES
ARMS GLEAMING KNIVES AND FORMIDABLE CLUBS APPEARED ABOVE THEM BUT THE BLOWS WERE EVIDENTLY GIVEN AT RANDOM THE AWFUL EFFECT WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE PIERCING SHRIEKS OF THE WOMEN AND THE FIERCE YELLS OF THE WARRIORS
HE WILL EVEN CONVEY DIFFERENT SIGNIFICATIONS BY THE SIMPLEST INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE PHILOLOGISTS HAVE SAID THAT THERE ARE BUT TWO OR THREE LANGUAGES PROPERLY SPEAKING
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS BAD FASHION A MAN WHO IS TOO CONSCIENTIOUS TO MISSPEND HIS DAYS AMONG THE WOMEN IN LEARNING THE NAMES OF BLACK MARKS MAY NEVER HEAR OF THE DEEDS OF HIS FATHERS
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO BUT PLAGUES SHALL SPREAD AND FUNERAL FIRES INCREASE TILL THE GREAT KING WITHOUT A RANSOM PAID TO HER OWN CHRYSA SEND THE BLACK EYED MAID POPE
WHOSE DECISION WAS LIKELY TO PRODUCE SO DEEP AN INFLUENCE ON HIS OWN FORTUNES
NOW IF YOU HAD A COMPANY OF THE ROYAL AMERICANS HERE IN WHAT MANNER WOULD YOU SET THEM TO WORK IN THIS BUSINESS
KNEW THE CHARACTER OF THOSE WITH WHOM HE WAS ABOUT TO CONTEND TOO WELL TO TRUST THE TREACHEROUS QUIET WHEN HE SAW HIS LITTLE BAND COLLECTED THE SCOUT THREW KILLDEER INTO THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM
HIS HEAD WAS IMMOVABLE NOR DID HE BETRAY THE SLIGHTEST CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ANY WERE PRESENT EXCEPT WHEN HIS HAUGHTY EYE ROLLED TOWARD THE DUSKY FORMS OF THE WARRIORS WHO STALKED IN THE BACKGROUND SILENT AND SULLEN OBSERVERS OF THE SCENE
AS IF IT CONTAINED THE SUBJECT OF THEIR COMMON THOUGHTS DURING THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SCENE A MAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AT THE FURTHEST EXTREMITY OF A PLATFORM OF ROCK WHICH FORMED THE LEVEL OF THE VILLAGE
A LONG AND MUSING PAUSE SUCCEEDED THE CHIEF CONSULTED APART WITH HIS COMPANIONS AND MESSENGERS DESPATCHED TO COLLECT CERTAIN OTHERS OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN OF THE TRIBE AS WARRIOR AFTER WARRIOR DROPPED IN
IN TOUCHING CONTRAST TO THE COLOR OF HIS SNOW WHITE LOCKS HIS TOMAHAWK WAS NEARLY HID IN SILVER AND THE HANDLE OF HIS KNIFE SHONE LIKE A HORN OF SOLID GOLD SO SOON AS THE FIRST HUM OF EMOTION AND PLEASURE
HE SEATED HIMSELF ON ONE END OF THE LOW PILE OF BRUSH WHICH SUSTAINED DUNCAN THE LATTER CAST AN IMPATIENT LOOK AT HIS NEIGHBOR AND FELT HIS FLESH CREEP WITH UNCONTROLLABLE HORROR WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN ACTUAL CONTACT WITH MAGUA
HE WAS WITHOUT ARMS AND HIS PAINT TENDED RATHER TO SOFTEN THAN INCREASE THE NATURAL STERNNESS OF HIS AUSTERE COUNTENANCE WHEN IN FULL VIEW OF THE DELAWARES HE STOPPED AND MADE A GESTURE OF AMITY
AND WHICH WERE GARTERED ABOVE THE KNEES WITH THE SINEWS OF A DEER A POUCH AND HORN COMPLETED HIS PERSONAL ACCOUTERMENTS THOUGH A RIFLE OF GREAT LENGTH WHICH THE THEORY OF THE MORE INGENIOUS WHITES HAD TAUGHT THEM WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL FIREARMS
UNTIL SUCH A ONE CHOSE TO MAKE SOME MOVEMENT NO DEEDS IN ARMS NO NATURAL GIFTS NOR ANY RENOWN AS AN ORATOR
HAVING COMMITTED NO PALPABLE SIN SINCE LAST ENTREATING HIS PARDONING GRACE I UNDERSTAND NOT YOUR ALLUSIONS ABOUT LINES AND ANGLES
BY THROWING HIS ARM UPWARD TOWARD HEAVEN AND THEN LETTING IT FALL IMPRESSIVELY ON HIS BREAST
ITS POWER EXCEEDED THAT OF THE PARTING DAY AND ASSISTED TO RENDER OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME MORE DISTINCT AND MORE HIDEOUS THE WHOLE SCENE FORMED A STRIKING PICTURE WHOSE FRAME WAS COMPOSED OF THE DARK AND TALL BORDER OF PINES
BUT BOYS LITTLE ABLE TO WIELD THE INSTRUMENTS TORE THE TOMAHAWKS FROM THE BELTS OF THEIR FATHERS AND STOLE INTO THE RANKS APT IMITATORS OF THE SAVAGE TRAITS EXHIBITED BY THEIR PARENTS
THE MAQUAS THE MINGOES AND THE IROQUOIS THOUGH NOT ALL STRICTLY THE SAME ARE IDENTIFIED FREQUENTLY BY THE SPEAKERS BEING POLITICALLY CONFEDERATED AND OPPOSED TO THOSE JUST NAMED MINGO
AND WERE SUCCEEDED BY SHRILL PIERCING YELLS
BUT HIS EXPERIENCE QUICKLY ADMONISHED HIM OF THE DANGER OF SO USELESS AN EXPERIMENT THEN HE LISTENED INTENTLY AND WITH PAINFUL UNCERTAINTY FOR THE SOUNDS OF HOSTILITY IN THE QUARTER WHERE UNCAS WAS LEFT
BUT A GENTLE PUSH FROM HIS FRIEND URGED HIM TOWARD THE DOOR AND ADMONISHED HIM OF THE DANGER THAT MIGHT ATTEND THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR INTERCOURSE SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY YIELDING TO THE NECESSITY HE QUITTED THE PLACE AND MINGLED WITH THE THRONG THAT HOVERED NIGH
BUT NOTHING WAS AUDIBLE EXCEPT THE SIGHING OF THE WIND THAT BEGAN TO SWEEP OVER THE BOSOM OF THE FOREST IN GUSTS WHICH THREATENED A TEMPEST AT LENGTH YIELDING RATHER TO HIS UNUSUAL IMPATIENCE THAN TAKING COUNSEL FROM HIS KNOWLEDGE
THAT THEIR HATCHETS WERE DULL AND TIME WAS NECESSARY TO SHARPEN THEM THE POLITIC CAPTAIN OF THE CANADAS HAD DEEMED IT WISER TO SUBMIT TO ENTERTAIN A PASSIVE FRIEND THAN BY ANY ACTS OF ILL JUDGED SEVERITY TO CONVERT HIM INTO AN OPEN ENEMY
CASTING A GLANCE AT THE DISTANT CORA
YOU MISTAKE THE PLACE OF REAL DANGER SAID HEYWARD IF ENEMIES HAVE REACHED THE PORTAGE AT ALL A THING BY NO MEANS PROBABLE AS OUR SCOUTS ARE ABROAD THEY WILL SURELY BE FOUND SKIRTING THE COLUMN
THE LOOKS OF MOST OF THE WARRIORS WERE RIVETED ON THE EARTH
BELIEVE ME HIS NATURAL TONES ARE BETTER FITTED FOR A MELLOW TENOR THAN THE BASS YOU HEARD IS HE THEN MUCH PRACTICED IN THE ART OF PSALMODY DEMANDED HER SIMPLE COMPANION ALICE FELT DISPOSED TO LAUGH
THEN YIELDING TO HER GENTLE INFLUENCE HE CLAPPED HIS SPURS
LEAVING THE PLACE BENEATH CLEAR OF ITS FUMES
HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO BE YOUR GIFT TO GO UNHARMED AMID FIRE AND AS YOU HAVE HITHERTO BEEN FAVORED MAJOR YOU HAVE LEFT YOUR RIFLE AT A COCK A SINGLE SHOT BEFORE THE TIME WOULD BE JUST TWENTY SCALPS LOST TO NO PURPOSE SINGER YOU CAN FOLLOW WE MAY FIND USE FOR YOU IN THE SHOUTINGS
OF COURSE SAID FILES THE FIELD FLOWERS MUST BE SECOND COUSINS TO A ROSE PRINCESS AND I BELIEVE IF YOU ASK THEM THEY WILL TELL YOU SHE LOOKED MORE CLOSELY AT THE FLOWERS THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF WHITE DAISIES GOLDEN BUTTERCUPS BLUEBELLS AND DAFFODILS GROWING BY THE ROADSIDE
THAT MUST BE MY DEAR BROTHER EXCLAIMED SHAGGY YES IT MUST BE ASSENTED KALIKO NO ONE ELSE INHABITS THIS SPLENDID DOME SO THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE BUT WHY DOES HE HIDE AMONG THOSE GREEN TREES
AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED HIM BEING CURIOUS TO WITNESS THE FINAL RESCUE OF HIS LONG SOUGHT LONG LOST BROTHER
THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER IS BEYOND THE REACH OF YOUR SPITE OR MALICE
I BELIEVE THE MAGICIAN WAS GOING THE OTHER WAY AND PROBABLY HE WENT MUCH FASTER THAN WE ARE GOING IT'S FAST ENOUGH TO SUIT ME REMARKED SHAGGY GENTLY REMOVING POLYCHROME'S HEEL FROM HIS LEFT EYE
AND THE BEAUTIFUL ROSE PRINCESS AND SHOOK HIS HEAD IT WOULD BE IMPOLITE AND I WON'T DO IT HE ASSERTED YOU MUST CRIED ANN IT IS YOUR DUTY TO OBEY ORDERS I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY ORDERS FROM MY OFFICERS OBJECTED THE PRIVATE
SO THAT HE COULD NOT ATTACK THEIR QUEEN AGAIN BY THIS TIME SHAGGY POLYCHROME
THEY THREW THEMSELVES UPON HIM AND HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN CAPTURING HIM WHEN THEIR FELLOW ADVENTURERS REACHED THE SPOT GOODNESS GRACIOUS CRIED BETSY WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU ALL
TIK TOK TACKLES A TOUGH TASK WHILE SHAGGY AND HIS COMPANIONS STOOD HUDDLED IN A GROUP AT ONE SIDE THE ARMY OF OOGABOO WAS APPROACHING ALONG THE PATHWAY THE TRAMP OF THEIR FEET BEING NOW AND THEN ACCOMPANIED BY A DISMAL GROAN
HAD MADE RAGS OF EVERY INCH OF THEIR ONCE BRILLIANT UNIFORMS A MORE TATTERED AND WOEFUL ARMY NEVER CAME OUT OF A BATTLE THAN THESE HARMLESS VICTIMS OF THE ROCKY PASSAGE BUT IT HAD SEEMED THEIR ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM THE CRUEL NOME KING
EXAMINED THEM WITH MUCH CURIOSITY THEN DISCOVERING THAT THREE OF THE PARTY WERE GIRLS HE LIFTED HIS CAP AND MADE A POLITE BOW
AND MY OFFICERS ARE UNABLE TO FIGHT THEY ARE EXCEPTIONALLY BRAVE IN COMMANDING OTHERS TO FIGHT BUT COULD NOT THEMSELVES MEET THE ENEMY AND CONQUER
THIS POLE HE STUCK IN THE GROUND JUST IN FRONT OF THE WELL AND THEN HE CRIED IN A LOUD VOICE I HEREBY CONQUER THIS TERRITORY IN THE NAME OF QUEEN ANN SOFORTH OF OOGABOO
CRIED THE COLONELS DRAWING THEIR SWORDS
AS ONE OF THE OFFICERS STEPPED ON A SHARP STONE OR KNOCKED HIS FUNNYBONE AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR'S SWORD HANDLE THEN OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES MARCHED PRIVATE FILES BEARING THE BANNER OF OOGABOO WHICH FLUTTERED FROM A LONG POLE
EXCLAIMED THE LITTLE GIRL BE PATIENT AND YOU'LL FIND OUT MY DEAR SAID POLYCHROME BUT ISN'T THIS AN ODD EXPERIENCE HERE AM I WHOSE HOME IS IN THE SKIES MAKING A JOURNEY THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE EARTH
SHOULDER YOUR GUN AND STAND READY TO MARCH ADVISED FILES SO TIK TOK HELD THE GUN STRAIGHT AND STOOD STILL WHAT NEXT HE ASKED THE QUEEN TURNED TO SHAGGY WHICH ROAD LEADS TO THE METAL MONARCH'S CAVERN
BUT AS HE HAD NO PLACE TO GO HE STOOD BY AND FACED HIS FORMER SERVANT WHO WAS NOW KING IN HIS PLACE IN A HUMBLE AND PLEADING MANNER
THE OFFICERS THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE TURNED A CORNER SO THEY KEPT ON THEIR WAY AND ALL OF THEM LIKEWISE DISAPPEARED ONE AFTER ANOTHER QUEEN ANN WAS RATHER SURPRISED AT THIS AND IN HASTENING FORWARD TO LEARN THE REASON SHE ALSO VANISHED FROM SIGHT
BUT THE GENERALS NOW SHOUTED FORWARD AND BIND THE PRISONERS AND THE COLONELS AND MAJORS AND CAPTAINS REPEATED THE COMMAND YELLING IT AS LOUD AS THEY COULD ALL THIS NOISE ANNOYED HANK WHO HAD BEEN EYEING THE ARMY OF OOGABOO WITH STRONG DISFAVOR
QUITE SMOOTHLY AND HIS JOINTS WORKED FAIRLY WELL COME COMMANDED TUBEKINS AND TURNING HIS BACK UPON THEM HE WALKED UP THE PATH TOWARD THE CASTLE SHALL WE GO ASKED QUEEN ANN UNCERTAINLY
SHOUTED THE MAJORS DRAWING THEIR SWORDS FALL IN BAWLED THE CAPTAINS DRAWING THEIR SWORDS
AND POSSESSES NO MAGIC POWERS WHATEVER
AND EVEN HER SHOES WERE SO CUT AND SLASHED THAT THEY WERE READY TO FALL FROM HER FEET THE OFFICERS HAD FARED SOMEWHAT WORSE THAN THEIR LEADER FOR HOLES WERE WORN IN THE KNEES OF THEIR TROUSERS WHILE SHARP POINTS OF ROCK IN THE ROOF AND SIDES OF THE TUNNEL
ADVANCED A LITTLE WAY ALONG ONE OF THE ROADS AND FOUND THAT IT WAS BORDERED BY PRETTY WILD FLOWERS WHY DON'T YOU ASK THE FLOWERS TO TELL YOU THE WAY HE SAID TO HIS COMPANION THE FLOWERS RETURNED THE PRINCESS SURPRISED AT THE QUESTION
AND I'LL SET ALL THESE PEOPLE FREE YOU SHALL BE MY DAUGHTER OR MY WIFE OR MY AUNT OR GRANDMOTHER WHICHEVER YOU LIKE ONLY STAY HERE TO BRIGHTEN MY GLOOMY KINGDOM AND MAKE ME HAPPY POLYCHROME LOOKED AT HIM WONDERINGLY
ONE BY ONE HE HAD MET THE INVADERS AND EASILY CAPTURED THEM THE DREADED LOVE MAGNET WAS INDEED IN SHAGGY'S POCKET ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY FROM THE KING BUT SHAGGY WAS POWERLESS TO SHOW IT
RUGGEDO HAD NO FEAR OF FILES OR OZGA BUT TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE HE HAD ORDERED GOLDEN HANDCUFFS PLACED UPON THEIR WRISTS THESE DID NOT CAUSE THEM ANY GREAT ANNOYANCE BUT PREVENTED THEM FROM MAKING AN ATTACK HAD THEY BEEN INCLINED TO DO SO
ONCE BETSY'S HEELS FLEW UP AND STRUCK A SIMILAR SUBSTANCE OVERHEAD THEY WERE INDEED DESCENDING THE HOLLOW TUBE THAT LED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD STOP HANK STOP CRIED THE GIRL
I KNOW AND I'LL GO AS SOON AS I HAVE FILLED MY POCKETS SAID RUGGEDO MEEKLY THEN FILL THEM AND BE GONE RETURNED THE NEW KING RUGGEDO OBEYED STOOPING DOWN HE BEGAN GATHERING UP JEWELS BY THE HANDFUL
THEY BECOME PRETTY TAME I BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE DECLARED SHAGGY MY DEAR BROTHER IS VERY WISE TO PREFER REAL TREES TO THE IMITATION ONES BUT COME LET US GO THERE AND FIND HIM SHAGGY STARTED FOR THE GREEN GROVE AT ONCE
THEN SHE TURNED TO SHAGGY AND ASKED ARE YOU SURE HE HASN'T SEEN THE LOVE MAGNET I'M POSITIVE ANSWERED SHAGGY BUT YOU SEEM TO BE SOMETHING OF A LOVE MAGNET YOURSELF POLYCHROME SHE LAUGHED AGAIN AND SAID TO RUGGEDO
AND BOWED TO RUGGEDO THEY'RE ALL GONE SAID HE
I ENLISTED TO FIGHT THE ENEMY AND BECOME A HERO BUT IF YOU WANT SOME ONE TO BIND HARMLESS GIRLS YOU WILL HAVE TO HIRE ANOTHER PRIVATE THEN HE WALKED OVER TO THE OTHERS AND SHOOK HANDS WITH SHAGGY AND TIK TOK
WHILE TWO SMALLER ONES BEFORE THE NOSTRILS ALLOWED THE MAN TO BREATHE FREELY THE CLOTH WAS THEN TIGHTLY DRAWN OVER THE UGLY ONE'S FACE AND KNOTTED AT THE BACK OF HIS NECK HE WAS DRESSED IN CLOTHES THAT HAD ONCE BEEN GOOD BUT NOW WERE SADLY WORN AND FRAYED
NO THANK YOU LAUGHED POLYCHROME MY HOME IS IN THE SKY AND I'M ONLY ON A VISIT TO THIS SOLID SORDID EARTH BUT TELL ME RUGGEDO WHY MY FRIENDS HAVE BEEN WOUND WITH CORDS AND BOUND WITH CHAINS
BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE NOME KING TO BE HIS MASTER AND WAS READY TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS THEREFORE HE REPEATED SHAGGY'S SPEECH TO THE KING WHO AT ONCE REALIZED THAT HIS KINGDOM WAS IN GRAVE DANGER
PERHAPS RUGGEDO HIMSELF MIGHT BREAK HIS OWN ENCHANTMENT SUGGESTED ANN BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE ALLOWED THE OLD KING TO ESCAPE NEVER MIND MY DEAR BROTHER SAID SHAGGY CONSOLINGLY I AM VERY HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND YOU AGAIN
YOU SEE SAID ANN HOW HELPLESS I AM HAD NOT PRIVATE FILES PROVED HIMSELF A TRAITOR AND A DESERTER I WOULD GLADLY HAVE CONQUERED THIS RUGGEDO BUT AN ARMY WITHOUT A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS LIKE A BEE WITHOUT A STINGER
BEHOLD THE UGLY ONE BUT WHEN THE NOMES SAW MY FACE THEY ALL FELL TO LAUGHING AND JEERING WHICH PREVENTED THEM FROM WORKING AT THEIR TASKS SEEING THIS RUGGEDO BECAME ANGRY AND PUSHED ME INTO A TUNNEL
SHE PICKED UP A PIECE OF ROCK AND POUNDED AGAINST HIS EYELIDS WITH IT SAYING WAKE UP QUOX WAKE UP BUT HE WOULD NOT WAKEN DEAR ME HOW UNFORTUNATE SIGHED THE LOVELY RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER
HIS SILK STOCKINGS HAD HOLES IN THEM AND HIS SHOES WERE STUB TOED AND NEEDED BLACKENING BUT WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT WHISPERED BETSY WHEN THE POOR MAN HAS BEEN A PRISONER FOR SO MANY YEARS SHAGGY HAD DARTED FORWARD
WHO HAD SHAKEN OFF THE GRASP OF THE OFFICERS WITHOUT EFFORT AND WAS NOW TRYING TO PULL THE BATTERED CROWN FROM OFF HIS EYES SHAGGY WHO WAS ALWAYS POLITE HELPED HIM TO DO THIS AND WHEN THE MAN WAS FREE AND COULD SEE AGAIN HE LOOKED AT HIS VISITORS WITH EVIDENT AMAZEMENT
REPLIED POLYCHROME I HAVE OFTEN HEARD OF THIS PASSAGE WHICH WAS ONCE BUILT BY A MAGICIAN WHO WAS A GREAT TRAVELER HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SAVE HIM THE BOTHER OF GOING AROUND THE EARTH'S SURFACE BUT HE TUMBLED THROUGH THE TUBE SO FAST
THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER LAUGHED MERRILY AND SO INFECTIOUS WAS THIS JOYOUS LAUGH THAT BETSY ECHOED IT
TO REST BETSY SAT ON HANK'S BACK POLYCHROME DANCED LIGHTLY UP AND DOWN THE JEWELED PATHS WHILE FILES AND THE PRINCESS WANDERED THROUGH THE GROVES ARM IN ARM TIK TOK WHO NEVER TIRED STOOD MOTIONLESS
HE COULD NOT GET THE LOVE MAGNET OUT OF HIS POCKET TRUE CRIED THE KING IN DELIGHT AT THIS EASY SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM GET AT ONCE A DOZEN NOMES WITH ROPES AND PLACE THEM IN THE PASSAGE WHERE THEY CAN SEIZE AND BIND SHAGGY AS SOON AS HE ENTERS
AND BURN IT IN LITTLE
WHETHER HE WAS CONSIDERING UNDER WHAT HEAD HE COULD BEST CHARGE THE NURSING IN THE BILL WAS BEST KNOWN TO HIMSELF DURING THIS SHORT CONVERSATION MISS MORLEENA AS THE ELDEST OF THE FAMILY
YOU SEE I KNOW HER GRIDE LOOKED AT HIM AS IF HE WERE PETRIFIED WITH ASTONISHMENT BUT DID NOT SPEAK PERHAPS LACKING THE POWER YOU AND ANOTHER MAN RALPH NICKLEBY BY NAME HAVE HATCHED THIS PLOT BETWEEN YOU PURSUED NICHOLAS
SEVERAL SLIGHT GESTURES ON THE PART OF THE INVALID SHOWED THAT THESE ARGUMENTS WERE NO MORE LOST UPON HIM THAN THE SMALLEST IOTA OF HIS DEMEANOUR WAS UPON RALPH WHAT IS IT NOW I SAY PURSUED THE WILY USURER OR WHAT HAS IT A CHANCE OF BEING
AND THE PUBLISHED SKETCH DOES NOT RESEMBLE HIM WHOEVER HE MAY BE IN ANY OTHER RESPECT STILL HE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS KNOW AT ONCE FOR WHOM IT IS MEANT BECAUSE THE CHARACTER IS SO LIKE HIM
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T OFFERED MYSELF EVEN TO THE FATHER YET I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BUT THAT YOU HAVE GATHERED ALREADY AH OH DEAR OH DEAR WHAT AN EDGED TOOL YOU ARE DON'T PLAY WITH ME THEN SAID RALPH IMPATIENTLY YOU KNOW THE PROVERB
WITH KISSES SAID ARTHUR GRIDE YES AND SHE'LL TELL ME AND PAY THEM BACK AND WE'LL LAUGH TOGETHER AND HUG OURSELVES AND BE VERY MERRY
WHERE I HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME PAST I UNDERTOOK TO DELIVER A MESSAGE TO YOU AY AY SAID MISTER KENWIGS AND I HAVE BEEN ADDED NICHOLAS ALREADY IN TOWN FOR SOME DAYS WITHOUT HAVING HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO
PEG EXPRESSING HER ACQUIESCENCE IN THIS ARRANGEMENT MISTER SQUEERS TURNED THE BOX BOTTOM UPWARDS AND TUMBLING THE CONTENTS UPON THE FLOOR HANDED IT TO HER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BOX BEING AN EXTEMPORARY DEVICE FOR ENGAGING HER ATTENTION
PROLONG HIS LIFE PERHAPS FOR MANY YEARS RESTORE HIM TO COMFORT I MAY ALMOST CALL IT AFFLUENCE AND RELIEVE A GENEROUS MAN FROM THE BURDEN OF ASSISTING ONE BY WHOM I GRIEVE TO SAY HIS NOBLE HEART IS LITTLE UNDERSTOOD
AND THEN WE MUST MAKE UP FOR IT I WON'T EAT MORE THAN I CAN HELP AND I KNOW YOU LOVE YOUR OLD MASTER TOO MUCH TO EAT MORE THAN YOU CAN HELP DON'T YOU PEG DON'T I WHAT SAID PEG LOVE YOUR OLD MASTER TOO MUCH NO NOT A BIT TOO MUCH SAID PEG
MEANTIME ALL HOLY ANGELS SHOWER BLESSINGS ON HIS HEAD AND PROSPER AND PRESERVE HIM SHE WAS HURRYING PAST NICHOLAS WHEN HE THREW HIMSELF BEFORE HER AND IMPLORED HER TO THINK BUT ONCE AGAIN UPON THE FATE TO WHICH SHE WAS PRECIPITATELY HASTENING
THE VOICE MADE ANSWER THAT THE TWIN BROTHERS WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER THE MAN WHOM HE HAD SEEN THAT NIGHT WAS TO BE DETAINED AND THAT ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOW MIDNIGHT THEY HAD SENT IN THEIR ANXIETY TO DO RIGHT YES
WHILE THE KITCHEN HAD A SEPARATE ENTRANCE DOWN THE AREA STEPS
SAT DOWN IN A CORNER AND HAD WHAT SHE TERMED A REAL GOOD CRY BUT NO CRYING OR TALKING OR HOPING OR FEARING COULD KEEP OFF THE DREADED SATURDAY AFTERNOON OR NEWMAN NOGGS EITHER WHO PUNCTUAL TO HIS TIME
TRUSTING TO OUR HOLDING HIM FAST ENOUGH I WARRANT YOU WE BOTH FELL INTO THE SAME SNARE OH DEAR WHAT A PITFALL IT WAS IT ALMOST RUINED ME AND LENT HIM OUR MONEY UPON BILLS WITH ONLY ONE NAME BESIDES HIS OWN WHICH TO BE SURE EVERYBODY SUPPOSED TO BE A GOOD ONE
THE NIGHT HAS COME IS THERE NO WAY TO ROB THEM OF FURTHER TRIUMPH AND SPURN THEIR MERCY AND COMPASSION IS THERE NO DEVIL TO HELP ME SWIFTLY THERE GLIDED AGAIN INTO HIS BRAIN
OR A GOOTTHER TO LIE ASLEEP IN AR WOULDN'T MAK ILL WORDS AMANG MY NEEBURS AND AR SPEAK TIV'EE QUIET LOIKE
AND HAND IT OVER TO YOU
HIS KINDEST LOVE RESUMED NICHOLAS AND TO SAY THAT HE HAD NO TIME TO WRITE BUT THAT HE WAS MARRIED TO MISS PETOWKER MISTER KENWIGS STARTED FROM HIS SEAT WITH A PETRIFIED STARE CAUGHT HIS SECOND DAUGHTER BY HER FLAXEN TAIL
THE POOR ATTENDANT WITH HER EYES SWOLLEN AND RED WITH WEEPING STOOD BY AND TO HER NICHOLAS APPEALED IN SUCH PASSIONATE TERMS THAT SHE OPENED A SIDE DOOR AND SUPPORTING HER MISTRESS INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM BECKONED NICHOLAS TO FOLLOW THEM
THE DOCTOR SHOOK HIS HEAD AY SAID MISTER KENWIGS AS THOUGH HE PITIED HIM FROM HIS HEART THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE OF ALL THIS TIME THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT WHISKING IN AND OUT OF THE OTHER ROOM
OLD ARTHUR GRIDE MOVED HIS LIPS BUT THEY ONLY FORMED AN UGLY SMILE AND WERE MOTIONLESS AGAIN YOU THINK SAID NICHOLAS THAT THE PRICE WOULD NOT BE PAID MISS BRAY HAS WEALTHY FRIENDS WHO WOULD COIN THEIR VERY HEARTS TO SAVE HER IN SUCH A STRAIT AS THIS
WHERE IMPOSTURE IGNORANCE AND BRUTAL CUPIDITY ARE THE STOCK IN TRADE OF A SMALL BODY OF MEN AND ONE IS DESCRIBED BY THESE CHARACTERISTICS ALL HIS FELLOWS WILL RECOGNISE SOMETHING BELONGING TO THEMSELVES
IT WAS A DARK WET GLOOMY NIGHT IN AUTUMN WHEN IN AN UPPER ROOM OF A MEAN HOUSE SITUATED IN AN OBSCURE STREET OR RATHER COURT NEAR LAMBETH THERE SAT ALL ALONE A ONE EYED MAN GROTESQUELY HABITED
PEG DID AS SHE WAS BIDDEN AND WAITED FOR THE NEXT
EVEN IF HE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LAUGH WITHOUT OBSERVING THAT HIS COUNTENANCE FELL AND THAT HE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE
MAKING A HALT IN HIS REFLECTIONS AT THIS PLACE
THINK WHAT A HAUL IT IS MY DAUGHTER SIR RETURNED BRAY HAUGHTILY AS I HAVE BROUGHT HER UP WOULD BE A RICH RECOMPENSE FOR THE LARGEST FORTUNE THAT A MAN COULD BESTOW IN EXCHANGE FOR HER HAND
NEWMAN SLOWLY BROUGHT FORTH FROM HIS DESK ONE OF THOSE PORTABLE BOTTLES CURRENTLY KNOWN AS POCKET PISTOLS AND SHAKING THE SAME CLOSE TO HIS EAR SO AS TO PRODUCE A RIPPLING SOUND VERY COOL AND PLEASANT TO LISTEN TO SUFFERED HIS FEATURES TO RELAX AND TOOK A GURGLING DRINK WHICH RELAXED THEM STILL MORE
REJOINED RALPH AY AY
HE WOULD HANG IT ROUND HIS NECK AGAIN THAT IT MIGHT REST WITH HIM IN THE GRAVE UPON HIS KNEES NICHOLAS GAVE HIM THIS PLEDGE
AND BEING GREATLY FATIGUED BOTH IN MIND AND BODY GRADUALLY FELL ASLEEP HE COULD NOT HAVE CLOSED HIS EYES FIVE MINUTES WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY A SCREAM AND STARTING UP IN THAT KIND OF TERROR WHICH AFFECTS A PERSON SUDDENLY ROUSED
VANISHED INTO THE HOUSE AND WAS SEEN NO LONGER NOW CONSIDERED AS AN ABSTRACT CIRCUMSTANCE THERE WAS NO MORE OBVIOUS CAUSE OR REASON WHY MISTER KENWIGS SHOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE OF MUFFLING THIS PARTICULAR KNOCKER
OF MILLINERS WHO HAD BEEN POSSESSED OF CONSIDERABLE PROPERTY THOUGH WHETHER THEY HAD ACQUIRED IT ALL IN BUSINESS OR HAD HAD A CAPITAL TO START WITH OR HAD BEEN LUCKY AND MARRIED TO ADVANTAGE SHE COULD NOT EXACTLY REMEMBER HOWEVER
A SMALL KEY WITH WHICH SHE SIGNED TO THAT GENTLEMAN TO OPEN IT MISTER SQUEERS WHO HAD EAGERLY FOLLOWED HER EVERY MOTION LOST NO TIME IN OBEYING THIS HINT AND THROWING BACK THE LID
AH HE'D HAVE MADE A GOOD UN IN OUR LINE BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO LIMITED FOR HIM HIS GENIUS WOULD HAVE BUSTED ALL BONDS AND COMING OVER EVERY OBSTACLE BROKE DOWN ALL BEFORE IT TILL IT ERECTED ITSELF INTO A MONNEYMENT OF WELL
OR DEPENDENCE ON YOURS I HAVE NO ORDERS BUT I HAVE FEARS FEARS THAT I WILL EXPRESS CHAFE AS YOU MAY FEARS THAT YOU MAY BE CONSIGNING THAT YOUNG LADY TO SOMETHING WORSE THAN SUPPORTING YOU BY THE LABOUR OF HER HANDS HAD SHE WORKED HERSELF DEAD
TO THIS RALPH DEIGNED NO OTHER REJOINDER THAN A HARSH SMILE AND A GLANCE AT THE SHRIVELLED OLD CREATURE BEFORE HIM WHICH WERE HOWEVER SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESSIVE NOW SAID GRIDE
A REPLY ALWAYS ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE CRIED OLD ARTHUR RAISING HIS HANDS AND EYES IN ADMIRATION HE IS ALWAYS PREPARED OH DEAR WHAT A BLESSING TO HAVE SUCH A READY WIT AND SO MUCH READY MONEY TO BACK IT
MANY OF MY FRIENDS HAVE MET A RELATION OF MISSUS KENWIGS'S IN THIS VERY ROOM AS WOULD DO HONOUR TO ANY COMPANY THAT'S ALL I'VE MET HIM SAID THE MARRIED LADY WITH A GLANCE TOWARDS DOCTOR LUMBEY IT'S NATERALLY VERY GRATIFYING TO MY FEELINGS AS A FATHER
IT'S PRETTY NIGH THE TIME TO WAIT UPON THE OLD WOMAN FROM WHAT SHE SAID LAST NIGHT I SUSPECT THAT IF I'M TO SUCCEED AT ALL I SHALL SUCCEED TONIGHT SO
MADELINE BRAY COME OF AGE OR MARRY THE SAID MADELINE HERE BURN THAT
AND OF BEING ENVIED AND COURTED BY ALL HIS FAMILY BESIDES AND RALPH ALWAYS WOUND UP THESE MENTAL SOLILOQUIES BY ARRIVING AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE MONEY NOT CONFINING HIMSELF TO THEORY
MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE I DESERVE NEITHER SUCH PRAISE NOR SUCH CENSURE CRIED ELIZABETH
ELIZABETH ASSURED HIM THAT SHE COULD SUIT HERSELF PERFECTLY WITH THOSE IN THE ROOM I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY
YES AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER WHO LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR CHEAPSIDE THAT IS CAPITAL ADDED HER SISTER AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY
ELIZABETH DID NOT QUIT HER ROOM FOR A MOMENT NOR WERE THE OTHER LADIES OFTEN ABSENT THE GENTLEMEN BEING OUT THEY HAD IN FACT NOTHING TO DO ELSEWHERE WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK THREE ELIZABETH FELT THAT SHE MUST GO AND VERY UNWILLINGLY SAID SO
I DO NOT TRUST MY OWN PARTIALITY WHEN SHE WAS ONLY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A MAN AT MY BROTHER GARDINER'S IN TOWN SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER THAT MY SISTER IN LAW WAS SURE HE WOULD MAKE HER AN OFFER BEFORE WE CAME AWAY
AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
LYDIA WAS A STOUT WELL GROWN GIRL OF FIFTEEN WITH A FINE COMPLEXION AND GOOD HUMOURED COUNTENANCE A FAVOURITE WITH HER MOTHER WHOSE AFFECTION HAD BROUGHT HER INTO PUBLIC AT AN EARLY AGE SHE HAD HIGH ANIMAL SPIRITS
WHEN THE FIRST TRANSPORTS OF RAGE WHICH HAD PRODUCED HIS ACTIVITY IN SEEKING HER WERE OVER
IS THIS A HINT TO ME LIZZY SAID HER FATHER TO SEND FOR THE HORSES NO INDEED I DO NOT WISH TO AVOID THE WALK THE DISTANCE IS NOTHING WHEN ONE HAS A MOTIVE ONLY THREE MILES I SHALL BE BACK BY DINNER
AND RESOLVING TO TURN HERSELF AND HER DAUGHTERS OUT OF THE HOUSE AS SOON AS MISTER BENNET WERE DEAD SHE COMPLAINED BITTERLY OF ALL THIS TO HER HUSBAND INDEED MISTER BENNET SAID SHE
COULD HE KNOW THAT THE PROPOSALS WHICH SHE HAD PROUDLY SPURNED ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO WOULD NOW HAVE BEEN MOST GLADLY AND GRATEFULLY RECEIVED HE WAS AS GENEROUS SHE DOUBTED NOT AS THE MOST GENEROUS OF HIS SEX BUT WHILE HE WAS MORTAL THERE MUST BE A TRIUMPH
TO WHICH MISS BINGLEY LOOKS FORWARD MAY ARRIVE EARLIER THAN SHE IS AWARE AND THAT THE DELIGHTFUL INTERCOURSE YOU HAVE KNOWN AS FRIENDS WILL BE RENEWED WITH YET GREATER SATISFACTION AS SISTERS MISTER BINGLEY WILL NOT BE DETAINED IN LONDON BY THEM
BUT HERE SHE DID INJUSTICE TO THE FIRE AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS CHARACTER FOR IT LED HIM TO ESCAPE OUT OF LONGBOURN HOUSE THE NEXT MORNING WITH ADMIRABLE SLYNESS AND HASTEN TO LUCAS LODGE TO THROW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN AND THE GOWN WHICH HAD BEEN LET DOWN TO HIDE IT NOT DOING ITS OFFICE YOUR PICTURE MAY BE VERY EXACT LOUISA SAID BINGLEY
WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS AND THEN YOU HAVE ADDED SO MUCH TO IT YOURSELF YOU ARE ALWAYS BUYING BOOKS
YOUR MOTHER INSISTS UPON YOUR ACCEPTING IT IS IT NOT SO MISSUS BENNET YES OR I WILL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN AN UNHAPPY ALTERNATIVE IS BEFORE YOU ELIZABETH
SHE ADDED IN A MELANCHOLY TONE
AS TO PREVENT YOUR FEELING THE LOSS OF THE THREE OF WHOM WE SHALL DEPRIVE YOU IT IS EVIDENT BY THIS ADDED JANE THAT HE COMES BACK NO MORE THIS WINTER
MISTER COLLINS MEANWHILE WAS MEDITATING IN SOLITUDE ON WHAT HAD PASSED HE THOUGHT TOO WELL OF HIMSELF TO COMPREHEND ON WHAT MOTIVES HIS COUSIN COULD REFUSE HIM AND THOUGH HIS PRIDE WAS HURT
IT IS UNLUCKY SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT PAUSE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT MAY WE NOT HOPE THAT THE PERIOD OF FUTURE HAPPINESS
ALL THIS SHE MUST POSSESS ADDED DARCY AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
OFFENDED BY HIS MANNER OF MENTIONING A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD I ASSURE YOU THERE IS QUITE AS MUCH OF THAT GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AS IN TOWN EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AND DARCY AFTER LOOKING AT HER FOR A MOMENT
SHE COULD NOT MAKE A VERY FAVOURABLE ANSWER JANE WAS BY NO MEANS BETTER THE SISTERS ON HEARING THIS REPEATED THREE OR FOUR TIMES HOW MUCH THEY WERE GRIEVED HOW SHOCKING IT WAS TO HAVE A BAD COLD AND HOW EXCESSIVELY THEY DISLIKED BEING ILL THEMSELVES
HIS LETTER WAS SOON DISPATCHED FOR THOUGH DILATORY IN UNDERTAKING BUSINESS
HER DISAPPOINTMENT IN CHARLOTTE MADE HER TURN WITH FONDER REGARD TO HER SISTER OF WHOSE RECTITUDE AND DELICACY SHE WAS SURE HER OPINION COULD NEVER BE SHAKEN AND FOR WHOSE HAPPINESS SHE GREW DAILY MORE ANXIOUS
WALKING WAS HER ONLY ALTERNATIVE SHE DECLARED HER RESOLUTION HOW CAN YOU BE SO SILLY CRIED HER MOTHER AS TO THINK OF SUCH A THING IN ALL THIS DIRT YOU WILL NOT BE FIT TO BE SEEN WHEN YOU GET THERE I SHALL BE VERY FIT TO SEE JANE WHICH IS ALL I WANT
MISTER BENNET'S PROPERTY CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY IN AN ESTATE OF TWO THOUSAND A YEAR WHICH UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIS DAUGHTERS WAS ENTAILED IN DEFAULT OF HEIRS MALE ON A DISTANT RELATION AND THEIR MOTHER'S FORTUNE
COME AS SOON AS YOU CAN ON RECEIPT OF THIS MY BROTHER AND THE GENTLEMEN ARE TO DINE WITH THE OFFICERS YOURS EVER CAROLINE BINGLEY WITH THE OFFICERS CRIED LYDIA I WONDER MY AUNT DID NOT TELL US OF THAT
I SHALL CHOOSE TO ATTRIBUTE IT TO YOUR WISH OF INCREASING MY LOVE BY SUSPENSE ACCORDING TO THE USUAL PRACTICE OF ELEGANT FEMALES I DO ASSURE YOU SIR THAT I HAVE NO PRETENSIONS WHATEVER TO THAT KIND OF ELEGANCE WHICH CONSISTS IN TORMENTING A RESPECTABLE MAN
AND BY THAT TIME MOST LIKELY CAPTAIN CARTER WOULD BE AT MERYTON AGAIN AND WHEN YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR BALL SHE ADDED I SHALL INSIST ON THEIR GIVING ONE ALSO I SHALL TELL COLONEL FORSTER IT WILL BE QUITE A SHAME IF HE DOES NOT
MISTER COLLINS RETURNED MOST PUNCTUALLY ON MONDAY FORTNIGHT BUT HIS RECEPTION AT LONGBOURN WAS NOT QUITE SO GRACIOUS AS IT HAD BEEN ON HIS FIRST INTRODUCTION HE WAS TOO HAPPY HOWEVER TO NEED MUCH ATTENTION
SAID MISS BINGLEY WILL SHE BE AS TALL AS I AM I THINK SHE WILL SHE IS NOW ABOUT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET'S HEIGHT OR RATHER TALLER HOW I LONG TO SEE HER AGAIN I NEVER MET
AND HER HUSBAND'S LOVE OF INDEPENDENCE HAD ALONE PREVENTED THEIR EXCEEDING THEIR INCOME FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS WAS SETTLED BY MARRIAGE ARTICLES ON MISSUS BENNET AND THE CHILDREN BUT IN WHAT PROPORTIONS IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED AMONGST THE LATTER DEPENDED ON THE WILL OF THE PARENTS
WHILE THE FAMILY WERE IN THIS CONFUSION CHARLOTTE LUCAS CAME TO SPEND THE DAY WITH THEM SHE WAS MET IN THE VESTIBULE BY LYDIA WHO FLYING TO HER CRIED IN A HALF WHISPER
I CANNOT COMPREHEND THE NEGLECT OF A FAMILY LIBRARY IN SUCH DAYS AS THESE
I THINK THERE CANNOT BE TOO LITTLE SAID ON THE SUBJECT LA
WHOSE FRIENDSHIP SHE VALUED BEYOND THAT OF ANY OTHER PERSON ELIZABETH WOULD WONDER AND PROBABLY WOULD BLAME HER AND THOUGH HER RESOLUTION WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN HER FEELINGS MUST BE HURT
THE NEXT DAY OPENED A NEW SCENE AT LONGBOURN MISTER COLLINS MADE HIS DECLARATION IN FORM HAVING RESOLVED TO DO IT WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME AS HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE EXTENDED ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY
AND ELIZABETH SOMETIMES WITH REAL EARNESTNESS AND SOMETIMES WITH PLAYFUL GAIETY REPLIED TO HER ATTACKS THOUGH HER MANNER VARIED HOWEVER HER DETERMINATION NEVER DID
SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS
AND MANY MONTHS WERE GONE BEFORE SHE COULD AT ALL FORGIVE THEIR DAUGHTER MISTER BENNET'S EMOTIONS WERE MUCH MORE TRANQUIL ON THE OCCASION AND SUCH AS HE DID EXPERIENCE HE PRONOUNCED TO BE OF A MOST AGREEABLE SORT
GOOD LORD SIR WILLIAM HOW CAN YOU TELL SUCH A STORY DO NOT YOU KNOW THAT MISTER COLLINS WANTS TO MARRY LIZZY NOTHING LESS THAN THE COMPLAISANCE OF A COURTIER COULD HAVE BORNE WITHOUT ANGER SUCH TREATMENT
AND OCCASIONALLY FROM SOME PEEVISH ALLUSIONS OF HER MOTHER AS FOR THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF HIS FEELINGS WERE CHIEFLY EXPRESSED NOT BY EMBARRASSMENT OR DEJECTION OR BY TRYING TO AVOID HER
CHAPTER EIGHT AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE TWO LADIES RETIRED TO DRESS AND AT HALF PAST SIX ELIZABETH WAS SUMMONED TO DINNER TO THE CIVIL INQUIRIES WHICH THEN POURED IN AND AMONGST WHICH SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF DISTINGUISHING THE MUCH SUPERIOR SOLICITUDE OF MISTER BINGLEY'S
WHEN LEVIN AND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH REACHED THE PEASANT'S HUT WHERE LEVIN ALWAYS USED TO STAY VESLOVSKY WAS ALREADY THERE HE WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HUT CLINGING WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE BENCH FROM WHICH HE WAS BEING PULLED BY A SOLDIER
PERHAPS SO SAID LEVIN DRYLY AND HE TURNED ON HIS SIDE TOMORROW EARLY I WANT TO GO SHOOTING AND I WON'T WAKE ANYONE AND SHALL SET OFF AT DAYBREAK
BUT THE IMPRESSION WAS SO STRONG THAT LEVIN COULD NEVER GET RID OF IT
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU NOW YOU MAY BEG AS YOU PLEASE BUT I WON'T BE OPEN WITH YOU SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU HE SAID MENTALLY LIKE A MAN WHO AFTER VAINLY ATTEMPTING TO EXTINGUISH A FIRE SHOULD FLY IN A RAGE WITH HIS VAIN EFFORTS AND SAY
BEFORE CROSSING THE BRIDGE AND WALKED TO THE HOUSE HE DID NOT GO UP THE STEPS TO THE STREET DOOR BUT WENT INTO THE COURT HAS YOUR MASTER COME HE ASKED A GARDENER NO SIR THE MISTRESS IS AT HOME
LET HIM WEARY OF HER BUT HE WOULD BE HERE WITH HER SO THAT SHE WOULD SEE HIM WOULD KNOW OF EVERY ACTION HE TOOK SHE WAS SITTING IN THE DRAWING ROOM NEAR A LAMP WITH A NEW VOLUME OF TAINE AND AS SHE READ LISTENING TO THE SOUND OF THE WIND OUTSIDE
DELIGHTED I BELIEVE I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING YOU AT PRINCESS SHTCHERBATSKAYA'S HE SAID GIVING LEVIN HIS HAND YES I QUITE REMEMBER OUR MEETING SAID LEVIN AND BLUSHING CRIMSON HE TURNED AWAY IMMEDIATELY AND BEGAN TALKING TO HIS BROTHER
A STURDY ENGLISH COB WITH CROPPED MANE AND SHORT TAIL HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD WITH HER BLACK HAIR
AND WITHOUT READING IT THROUGH SENT IT OFF BY A SPECIAL MESSENGER THE NEXT MORNING SHE RECEIVED HIS LETTER AND REGRETTED HER OWN SHE DREADED A REPETITION OF THE SEVERE LOOK HE HAD FLUNG AT HER AT PARTING ESPECIALLY WHEN HE KNEW THAT THE BABY WAS NOT DANGEROUSLY ILL
WHY WHAT IS IT WHAT ABOUT SHE ASKED SITTING DOWN WELL LET'S TALK IF IT'S SO NECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GET TO SLEEP ANNA SAID WHAT CAME TO HER LIPS AND MARVELED HEARING HERSELF AT HER OWN CAPACITY FOR LYING
HER PEACE OF MIND WAS DESTROYED IN SOLITUDE AFTERWARDS THINKING OVER THAT GLANCE WHICH HAD EXPRESSED HIS RIGHT TO FREEDOM SHE CAME AS SHE ALWAYS DID TO THE SAME POINT THE SENSE OF HER OWN HUMILIATION
DOLLY WAS BEGINNING A QUESTION AS TO WHAT NAME THE LITTLE GIRL WOULD HAVE BUT NOTICING A SUDDEN FROWN ON ANNA'S FACE SHE CHANGED THE DRIFT OF HER QUESTION HOW DID YOU MANAGE HAVE YOU WEANED HER YET
ONE DISTRICT'S ENOUGH AND SVIAZHSKY'S OBVIOUSLY OF THE OPPOSITION HE SAID WORDS EVIDENTLY INTELLIGIBLE TO ALL EXCEPT LEVIN WHY KOSTYA YOU HERE TOO
HE WAS IN FRONT OF ALL AND CUT HIS WIDE ROW WITHOUT BENDING AS THOUGH PLAYING WITH THE SCYTHE LEVIN GOT OFF HIS MARE AND FASTENING HER UP BY THE ROADSIDE WENT TO MEET TIT WHO TOOK A SECOND SCYTHE OUT OF A BUSH AND GAVE IT TO HIM IT'S READY SIR
HE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY BECOME AGITATED OVER WHAT WAS THE AFFAIR OF HER CONSCIENCE AND WAS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE BARRIER HE FANCIED BETWEEN THEM
NO THAT'S UNFAIR SAID VESLOVSKY HOW COULD ENVY COME IN THERE IS SOMETHING NOT NICE ABOUT THAT SORT OF BUSINESS YOU SAY LEVIN WENT ON THAT IT'S UNJUST FOR ME TO RECEIVE FIVE THOUSAND WHILE THE PEASANT HAS FIFTY
LEVIN LEAPED OUT AND HELPED GRISHA OUT AFTER HIM
THAT NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW THE SOLICITOR CERTAINLY DID NOT KNOW
SECONDLY IF IT SHOULD APPEAR THAT THE CONDITION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES ACTUALLY WAS SUCH AS IT APPEARED TO BE FROM THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS IN THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT ANOTHER NEW SCIENTIFIC COMMISSION SHOULD BE APPOINTED
THE COUNT GOES INTO EVERYTHING HIMSELF AH WHAT A HUSBAND DOLLY WAS GLAD WHEN ANNA CAME IN AND BY HER ENTRANCE PUT A STOP TO ANNUSHKA'S GOSSIP
AND IN CONVERSATION WITH ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HINTED AT THE UNSUITABILITY OF ANNA'S CLOSE INTIMACY WITH BETSY AND VRONSKY ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH STERNLY CUT HER SHORT
ANNA IS THIS YOU SAID ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH QUIETLY MAKING AN EFFORT OVER HIMSELF AND RESTRAINING THE MOTION OF HIS FINGERS
I SOMETIMES FEEL SORRY I'M SO SUPERFLUOUS HERE SAID ANNA GOING OUT OF THE NURSERY AND HOLDING UP HER SKIRT SO AS TO ESCAPE THE PLAYTHING STANDING IN THE DOORWAY IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT WITH MY FIRST CHILD
AS THOUGH DIRECTLY SHE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF THIS SHE THE REAL ANNA RETREATED SOMEHOW INTO HERSELF AND ANOTHER STRANGE AND UNACCOUNTABLE WOMAN CAME OUT WHOM HE DID NOT LOVE
THAT SHE POSITIVELY MUST COME TO MOSCOW HE TALKS OF GETTING A DOCTOR DOWN MAMAN HE'LL DO EVERYTHING HE HAS AGREED TO EVERYTHING KITTY SAID ANGRY WITH HER MOTHER FOR APPEALING TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH
NO EXCUSE ME BUT IF YOU CONSIDER THIS INEQUALITY IS UNJUST WHY IS IT YOU DON'T ACT ACCORDINGLY WELL I DO ACT NEGATIVELY ON THAT IDEA
AND BELIEVED THE MASS OF THE NOBILITY TO BE SECRETLY IN FAVOR OF SERFDOM AND ONLY CONCEALING THEIR VIEWS FROM COWARDICE HE REGARDED RUSSIA AS A RUINED COUNTRY RATHER AFTER THE STYLE OF TURKEY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA AS SO BAD
GIVE IT TO THIS PEASANT HE WOULD NOT REFUSE IT YES BUT HOW AM I TO GIVE IT UP AM I TO GO TO HIM AND MAKE A DEED OF CONVEYANCE
BRIGHTLY LIGHTED UP BY THE MOONLIGHT THEY WERE STANDING TALKING STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS SAYING SOMETHING OF THE FRESHNESS OF ONE GIRL COMPARING HER TO A FRESHLY PEELED NUT
VRONSKY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW SHE WITH HER STRONG AND TRUTHFUL NATURE COULD ENDURE THIS STATE OF DECEIT AND NOT LONG TO GET OUT OF IT BUT HE DID NOT SUSPECT THAT THE CHIEF CAUSE OF IT
BESIDE HIM WAS STANDING TANYA WITH A PLATE ON THE PRETEXT OF WANTING TO GIVE SOME DINNER TO HER DOLLS SHE HAD ASKED THE GOVERNESS'S PERMISSION TO TAKE HER SHARE OF TART TO THE NURSERY
BUT BEFORE THE MAID SHE FELT IF NOT EXACTLY ASHAMED AT LEAST UNCOMFORTABLE DARYA ALEXANDROVNA HAD A GREAT SENSE OF RELIEF WHEN ANNUSHKA WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN FOR YEARS WALKED IN
BUT UTTERLY WITHOUT ANY COMPREHENSION OF THE NEEDS OF MODERN DAYS HE ALWAYS TOOK IN EVERY QUESTION THE SIDE OF THE NOBILITY HE WAS POSITIVELY ANTAGONISTIC TO THE SPREAD OF POPULAR EDUCATION AND HE SUCCEEDED
HIS LIPS SWELLED HIS EYES WERE SWIMMING WITH TEARS DOLLY HE SAID SOBBING NOW FOR MERCY'S SAKE THINK OF THE CHILDREN THEY ARE NOT TO BLAME I AM TO BLAME AND PUNISH ME MAKE ME EXPIATE MY FAULT ANYTHING I CAN DO I AM READY TO DO ANYTHING
THEY WERE EVEN SOME OF THEM GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM AND PURPOSELY TO LET HIM GET A GOOD MANY VOTES SO THAT THE ENEMY MIGHT BE THROWN OFF THE SCENT AND WHEN A CANDIDATE OF THE OTHER SIDE WAS PUT UP THEY TOO MIGHT GIVE HIM SOME VOTES
AND HER FACE SUDDENLY SOFTENED SHE SEEMED TO BE PULLING HERSELF TOGETHER FOR A FEW SECONDS AS THOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE WAS DOING AND GETTING UP RAPIDLY SHE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR WELL SHE LOVES MY CHILD HE THOUGHT
WITH A BROAD RED BEARD GRAY ON HIS CHEEKS OPENED THE GATE
ONE EXPERIENCES IN DREAMS WHEN ONE TRIES TO USE PHYSICAL FORCE HE FELT THIS FREQUENTLY AS HE TALKED TO HIS MOST GOOD NATURED SOLICITOR THIS SOLICITOR DID IT SEEMED EVERYTHING POSSIBLE AND STRAINED EVERY NERVE TO GET HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
WHEN HE'S HERE I NEVER TAKE IT HARDLY EVER HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE ELECTION AND ANNA KNEW HOW BY ADROIT QUESTIONS TO BRING HIM TO WHAT GAVE HIM MOST PLEASURE HIS OWN SUCCESS
FOR INSTANCE TO LOOK LIKE A COPSE WHICH HAS GROWN UP OF ITSELF IN EUROPE AND I CAN'T GUSH OVER THESE BIRCH BRANCHES AND BELIEVE IN THEM SERGEY IVANOVITCH MERELY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AS THOUGH TO EXPRESS HIS WONDER HOW THE BIRCH BRANCHES HAD COME INTO THEIR ARGUMENT AT THAT POINT
THERE WOULD BE NEEDED TWENTY FOUR YARDS OF NAINSOOK AT SIXTEEN PENCE THE YARD WHICH WAS A MATTER OF THIRTY SHILLINGS BESIDES THE CUTTING OUT AND MAKING AND THESE THIRTY SHILLINGS HAD BEEN SAVED
HE ADDED TURNING TO LEVIN AND DRAWING HIS ARM THROUGH HIS LEVIN WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD INDEED TO BE CONVERTED BUT COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT THE POINT WAS
UNHAPPY NO THIS IS MY UNHAPPINESS SHE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF HER SON'S VOICE COMING TOWARDS THEM AND GLANCING SWIFTLY ROUND THE TERRACE SHE GOT UP IMPULSIVELY
COSTING SEVEN POUNDS AND THAT SEVEN POUNDS PAID FOR THE UNIFORM WAS THE CHIEF CAUSE THAT FINALLY DECIDED LEVIN TO GO HE WENT TO KASHIN
I SIMPLY MEAN TO SAY THAT THOSE RIGHTS THAT TOUCH ME MY INTEREST I SHALL ALWAYS DEFEND TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
MY FATHER HIMSELF TOOK ME TO THE CARRIAGE I BROKE AWAY FROM HIM WITH A DESPERATION WHICH NOT EVEN HIS RESOLUTION COULD RESIST I RAN I FLEW ALONG THE PATH THAT LED TO DERMODY'S COTTAGE THE DOOR STOOD OPEN
AND LOOKED AGAIN AT THE PRETTY GREEN FLAG AND BURST OUT CRYING A LIGHT TOUCH ROUSED ME MY FATHER HAD SO FAR YIELDED AS TO LEAVE TO MY MOTHER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BRINGING ME BACK TO THE TRAVELING CARRIAGE
IN THAT TIME HUNDREDS ON HUNDREDS OF MILES WERE BETWEEN US AND YET SHE WAS NOW AS NEAR ME AS IF SHE WERE WALKING IN THE GARDEN BY MY SIDE THIS STRANGE CONDITION OF MY MIND
SEEING THAT I WAS APPROACHING HIM THE STRANGER MET ME MIDWAY HIS DRESS AND MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT I HAD NOT ENCOUNTERED THIS TIME A PERSON IN THE LOWER RANKS OF LIFE
AN AFTER DAY THE NEXT MOMENT TO MY ASTONISHMENT THIS CHANGEABLE CREATURE CHANGED AGAIN SOME FORGOTTEN CONSIDERATION SEEMED TO HAVE OCCURRED TO HER SHE TURNED PALE THE SOFT LINES OF PLEASURE IN HER FACE HARDENED
ASKING MY WAY TO THE FISHING OFFICE OF MESSRS VAN BRANDT EITHER MY FOREIGN ACCENT MADE ME UNINTELLIGIBLE OR THE MAN'S SUSPICIONS DISINCLINED HIM TO TRUST ME AGAIN HE SHOOK HIS CUDGEL
IS IT INSANE SUSPICION WHICH HAS MADE ME SO ANGRY WITH THE GOOD FRIENDS WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE MY REASON IS IT INSANE TERROR WHICH SETS ME ON ESCAPING
WHICH I HAD DELIBERATELY SET MYSELF TO MAKE I THOUGHT OF HER SHATTERED HEALTH OF HER MELANCHOLY EXISTENCE IN SHADOW AND SOLITUDE OF THE RICH TREASURES OF SUCH A HEART AND SUCH A MIND AS HERS WASTED
AT SIR JAMES'S SUGGESTION HOWEVER ONE VISITOR AT THE HOTEL HAS BEEN ASKED TO DINE WITH US WHO CLAIMS DISTINCTION AS NO ORDINARY GUEST THE PHYSICIAN WHO FIRST WARNED ME OF THE CRITICAL STATE OF MY MOTHER'S HEALTH
IN THE COURSE OF NATURE I CANNOT HOPE TO BE WITH YOU MUCH LONGER WHEN I AM GONE WHO WILL BE LEFT TO CARE FOR YOU AND LOVE YOU IN THE PLACE OF YOUR MOTHER NO ONE WILL BE LEFT UNLESS YOU MARRY MISSUS VAN BRANDT
HAS ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT I FORESAW THE DEPLORABLE CONSEQUENCES WHICH MIGHT FOLLOW OUR MARRIAGE AND THAT I OVER AND OVER AGAIN
SHE HAD ROUSED MY JEALOUSY I POSITIVELY REFUSED TO LEAVE HER I INSIST ON KNOWING WHAT BINDS YOU TO THAT MAN I SAID LET HIM COME BACK IF YOU WON'T ANSWER MY QUESTION I WILL PUT IT TO HIM
THE RESULT YOU SAW FOR YOURSELVES WHEN YOU DINED AT OUR HOUSE I INFORM YOU OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITHOUT MAKING ANY COMMENT MISTER GERMAINE'S NARRATIVE
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT SHE WAS DELIGHTED AT THE PROSPECT OF TRAVELING SHE SHOCKED THE SCHOOLMISTRESS BY WAVING HER HAT OVER HER HEAD AND CRYING HOORAY LIKE A BOY
AND THE MOORLAND COUNTRY BEYOND SLOWLY PURSUING MY WALK I PROPOSED TO MYSELF TO OCCUPY MY MIND TO SOME USEFUL PURPOSE BY ARRANGING BEFOREHAND THE COMPOSITION OF THE LETTER
LOOKING UP THE STREET AND DOWN THE STREET IN EVIDENT EMBARRASSMENT WHAT TO SAY NEXT DO YOU PROPOSE STAYING IN EDINBURGH I ASKED OH NO I DON'T WISH TO REMAIN IN SCOTLAND I WANT TO GO MUCH FURTHER AWAY
SHE STOOD BEFORE ME MISTER GERMAINE SHE EXCLAIMED STARTING BACK AS IF THE BARE SIGHT OF ME REPELLED HER IS THIS HONORABLE IS THIS WORTHY OF YOU YOU ALLOW ME TO BE ENTRAPPED INTO RECEIVING YOU
I QUESTIONED MY OWN FEELINGS AND IMPRESSIONS ON THE CHANCE THAT THEY MIGHT SERVE ME AS A MEANS OF SOLVING THE MYSTERY OF HER SUDDEN FLIGHT FROM THE ROOM WHAT EFFECT HAD SHE PRODUCED ON ME IN PLAIN TRUTH
IF HIS PRESENT COURSE OF LIFE IS NOT ALTERED
I SHALL DO VERY WELL HERE I SEE YOU ARE KINDLY READY TO WRITE FOR ME YES SHE SAID AT YOUR OWN CONVENIENCE WHEN YOU ARE READY MY PEN IS READY THE UNACKNOWLEDGED RESERVE THAT HAD COME BETWEEN US
JUST LARGE ENOUGH TO ALLOW OF THE PASSAGE THROUGH IT OF A DOG OF THE TERRIER OR THE SPANIEL BREED AND THERE BEGAN AND ENDED THE SIMPLE
WITH WHICH I REGARDED MISS DUNROSS WHAT WAS THE FEELING THEN I CAN ONLY ANSWER THE QUESTION IN ONE WAY THE FEELING LAY TOO DEEP IN ME FOR MY SOUNDING WHAT IMPRESSION
SHE LIFTED HER NOBLE HEAD HER GRAND GUILELESS GRAY EYES RESTED ON ME WITH A LOOK OF PATIENT REPROACH I HAVE NOT GOT A FRIEND IN THE WORLD SHE SAID FOR GOD'S SAKE ASK ME NO MORE QUESTIONS TO NIGHT
REALITIES TO ME AND TO NO ONE ELSE WHAT ARE THE DREAMS OF MISSUS VAN BRANDT WHAT ARE THE GHOSTLY APPARITIONS OF HER WHICH I BELIEVE MYSELF TO HAVE SEEN
WHILE I HAVE BEEN AWAY NO SIR HAVE ANY VISITORS CALLED ONE VISITOR HAS CALLED SIR DO YOU KNOW WHO IT WAS THE PORTER MENTIONED THE NAME OF A CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN A MAN AT THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION IN THOSE DAYS
OH SIR I WILL INDEED BE WORTHY OF THE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN IN ME HER EYES MOISTENED HER VARIABLE COLOR CAME AND WENT HER DRESS HEAVED SOFTLY OVER THE LOVELY OUTLINE OF HER BOSOM
WAS TO CONCILIATE THE FELLOW BEFORE I LEFT THE HOUSE I AM SORRY NOT TO BE ABLE TO ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION I SAID AS WE WALKED TOGETHER TO THE DOOR PERHAPS YOU WILL GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE HIS EYES TWINKLED CUNNINGLY
I RESOLVE TO GO THE NEXT MORNING WANDERING AMONG THE SCENES OF MY BOYHOOD I CAN CONSIDER WITH MYSELF HOW I MAY BEST BEAR THE BURDEN
WHICH IN OUR SUFFOLK TONGUE WE CALLED GREENWATER BROAD WIND WHERE IT MIGHT THE GRASSY BANKS AND THE OVERHANGING TREES TINGED THE LAKE WITH THE SOFT GREEN REFLECTIONS FROM WHICH IT TOOK ITS NAME
A LAST APPEARANCE OF TRIM TOOK PLACE A LAST ADVANCE A LAST CAUTIOUS PAUSE WAS MADE BY THE DUCKS THE BAILIFF TOUCHED THE STRINGS THE WEIGHED NET WORK FELL VERTICALLY INTO THE WATER
AND RESUME MY PLACE AT THE TABLE THE INDIGNATION THAT I FEEL NATURALLY ENOUGH I THINK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES MAKES A GOOD ACTOR OF ME FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE
HE HAS SOLD THE PLATE AND THE JEWELS THAT CAME TO ME FROM HIS MOTHER THE LAND IN AMERICA SWALLOWS IT ALL UP WE HAVE NO HOME GEORGE AND NO CHOICE BUT TO GO WITH HIM AN HOUR AFTERWARD THE POST CHAISE WAS AT THE DOOR
TO WHOM I OWE THEM IS NEVER LIKELY TO CROSS MY PATH AGAIN THE VAN BRANDTS OF AMSTERDAM HAVE RECEIVED CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT HE IS NOW ON HIS WAY TO NEW ZEALAND
AND LOOKED AT ME DISCOVERING THAT I WAS A STRANGER HE LIFTED A THICK CUDGEL
HIM SHOOK IT THREATENINGLY AND CALLED TO ME IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE AS I GATHERED BY HIS ACTIONS TO STAND BACK A STRANGER IN EUKHUIZEN AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT WAS EVIDENTLY RECKONED AS A ROBBER
HE SAID WHEN YOUR FATHER COMES HOME DO YOU THINK HE WILL APPROVE OF HIS SON AND HEIR KISSING HIS BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER WHEN MY FATHER COMES HOME I ANSWERED WITH GREAT DIGNITY
TO TAKE THE ROMANTIC VIEW OF LOVE AND SOME MATTER OF FACT WOMAN OF THE PRESENT DAY MAY HAVE BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED HIM WHATEVER MAY BE THE CAUSE THE EFFECT IS PLAIN HIS NERVES HAVE BROKEN DOWN AND
AND IN TRACING EFFECTS ACCURATELY TO THEIR DISTANT AND HIDDEN CAUSE
COME TO ME ONCE MORE MY CHILD LOVE IN THE INNOCENT BEAUTY OF YOUR FIRST TEN YEARS OF LIFE LET US LIVE AGAIN MY ANGEL AS WE LIVED IN OUR FIRST PARADISE BEFORE SIN AND SORROW
WE USED NO TAME DUCKS AS DECOYS IN SUFFOLK WAS A LITTLE BLACK TERRIER A SKILLED MASTER ALSO IN HIS WAY A CREATURE WHO POSSESSED IN EQUAL PROPORTIONS
AND I WILL DO IT BEFORE I LEAVE YOU TO NIGHT I DIPPED MY PEN IN THE INK AS I SAID THE WORDS LET ME CONFESS FRANKLY THE LENGTHS TO WHICH MY INFATUATION LED ME THE DRESSMAKER TO WHOM I HAD ALLUDED
THE WRITING OF THE LETTER WOULD OCCUPY US AT ANY RATE
AND NOW YOU ARE ANGRY WITH ME TOO BECAUSE I HAVE A MAN HERE I FOUND THE POOR CREATURE SITTING ALL ALONE ASTRIDE OF A KEEL FOR JOVE HAD STRUCK HIS SHIP WITH LIGHTNING AND SUNK IT IN MID OCEAN
BUT THE SWINEHERD SAW HIM AND SAID TO ULYSSES WHO WAS BESIDE HIM ULYSSES
WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY CLEANED ALL THE TABLES AND SEATS WITH SPONGES AND WATER WHILE TELEMACHUS AND THE TWO OTHERS SHOVELLED UP THE BLOOD AND DIRT FROM THE GROUND AND THE WOMEN CARRIED IT ALL AWAY
AND SAVE ME FROM THE ANGER OF THE SEA GOD NEPTUNE FOR I APPROACH YOU PRAYERFULLY ANY ONE WHO HAS LOST HIS WAY HAS AT ALL TIMES A CLAIM EVEN UPON THE GODS
AND WILL SEND YOU A FAIR WIND TO TAKE YOU HOME IF THE GODS IN HEAVEN SO WILL IT FOR THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS AND CAN SETTLE THEM BETTER THAN I CAN ULYSSES SHUDDERED AS HE HEARD HER NOW GODDESS HE ANSWERED
TO TELL THE WOMEN AND MAKE THEM COME TO ULYSSES IN THE MEANTIME HE CALLED TELEMACHUS THE STOCKMAN AND THE SWINEHERD BEGIN SAID HE TO REMOVE THE DEAD AND MAKE THE WOMEN HELP YOU THEN
FOR HIS FATHER AND THE OTHER CHIEFTAINS SENT HIM ON A MISSION TO RECOVER THEM
WHEN THEY HAD SATISFIED THEMSELVES WITH MEAT AND DRINK CALYPSO SPOKE SAYING
OR WAKES THEM JUST AS HE PLEASES
AS IT WAS RETURNING FROM AN ESCORT AND BURY OUR CITY UNDER A HIGH MOUNTAIN
BRING ME SULPHUR WHICH CLEANSES ALL POLLUTION AND FETCH FIRE ALSO THAT I MAY BURN IT AND PURIFY THE CLOISTERS GO MOREOVER AND TELL PENELOPE TO COME HERE WITH HER ATTENDANTS
HE WILL COME DOWN HERE TO FETCH YOU AND HE WILL NOT GO BACK WITHOUT YOU BUT HE WILL BE VERY ANGRY WITH THIS HE DROVE HIS GOODLY STEEDS BACK TO THE CITY OF THE PYLIANS AND SOON REACHED HIS HOME
I AM AFRAID SOME GREAT WAVE WILL LIFT ME OFF MY LEGS AND DASH ME AGAINST THE ROCKS AS I LEAVE THE WATER WHICH WOULD GIVE ME A SORRY LANDING IF ON THE OTHER HAND I SWIM FURTHER IN SEARCH OF SOME SHELVING BEACH OR HARBOUR
SEEMED TO BE STILL A GOOD WAY OFF I KNOW WHAT I WILL DO I AM SURE IT WILL BE BEST NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I WILL STICK TO THE RAFT AS LONG AS HER TIMBERS HOLD TOGETHER BUT WHEN THE SEA BREAKS HER UP I WILL SWIM FOR IT
WHO WAS THE HEAD AND FRONT OF THE OFFENDING LIES LOW ALREADY IT WAS ALL HIS DOING IT WAS NOT THAT HE WANTED TO MARRY PENELOPE HE DID NOT SO MUCH CARE ABOUT THAT WHAT HE WANTED WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT AND JOVE
HE GOT TO THE ISLAND WHICH WAS HIS JOURNEY'S END HE LEFT THE SEA AND WENT ON BY LAND TILL HE CAME TO THE CAVE WHERE THE NYMPH CALYPSO LIVED HE FOUND HER AT HOME THERE WAS A LARGE FIRE BURNING ON THE HEARTH
BREEDS MANY SUCH AND I KNOW THAT NEPTUNE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME WHILE HE WAS THUS IN TWO MINDS A WAVE CAUGHT HIM AND TOOK HIM WITH SUCH FORCE
THAT IT BROKE THE MAST HALF WAY UP AND BOTH SAIL AND YARD WENT OVER INTO THE SEA FOR A LONG TIME ULYSSES WAS UNDER WATER
AND PUT IT OUT OF DOORS THEN WHEN THEY HAD MADE THE WHOLE PLACE QUITE CLEAN AND ORDERLY
AND IN THE END HE DEEMED IT BEST TO TURN HIS HORSES TOWARDS THE SHIP
OR YOUNG AS I AM I WILL PELT YOU WITH STONES BACK TO THE COUNTRY FOR I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO I WISH I WAS AS MUCH STRONGER THAN ALL THE OTHER SUITORS IN THE HOUSE AS I AM THAN YOU
THAT HE IS OF NOBLE BIRTH GIVE HIM THE BOW AND LET US SEE WHETHER HE CAN STRING IT OR NO I SAY AND IT SHALL SURELY BE THAT IF APOLLO
AS HE ROSE ON THE SWELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY AHEAD AND COULD SEE LAND QUITE NEAR THEN AS CHILDREN REJOICE WHEN THEIR DEAR FATHER BEGINS TO GET BETTER AFTER HAVING FOR A LONG TIME BORNE SORE AFFLICTION SENT HIM BY SOME ANGRY SPIRIT
IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SOUTH NORTH EAST AND WEST WINDS WERE ALL PLAYING BATTLEDORE AND SHUTTLECOCK WITH IT AT ONCE
I DO NOT THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I HAVE LET YOU OFF TOO LIGHTLY ON THIS HE LASHED HIS HORSES
I MAY ESCAPE THE COLD AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S REST BUT SOME SAVAGE BEAST MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME AND DEVOUR ME
THESE SUITORS ARE A FEEBLE FOLK THEY ARE PAYING COURT TO THE WIFE OF A BRAVE MAN WHOSE BOW NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO STRING AND YET A BEGGARLY TRAMP WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE STRUNG IT AT ONCE AND SENT AN ARROW THROUGH THE IRON
FOR THE FOOT WHICH YOU GAVE ULYSSES WHEN HE WAS BEGGING ABOUT IN HIS OWN HOUSE THUS SPOKE THE STOCKMAN AND ULYSSES STRUCK THE SON OF DAMASTOR WITH A SPEAR IN CLOSE FIGHT
WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS THEY WERE AFRAID AND GOT READY THE BULLS
MOREOVER SHE MADE THE WIND FAIR AND WARM FOR HIM AND GLADLY DID ULYSSES SPREAD HIS SAIL BEFORE IT WHILE HE SAT AND GUIDED THE RAFT SKILFULLY BY MEANS OF THE RUDDER
THEREON MINERVA BEGAN TO TELL THEM OF THE MANY SUFFERINGS OF ULYSSES FOR SHE PITIED HIM AWAY THERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE NYMPH CALYPSO FATHER JOVE SAID SHE
AND HERE HE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE FOR THERE WERE NO ROCKS AND IT AFFORDED SHELTER FROM THE WIND HE FELT THAT THERE WAS A CURRENT SO HE PRAYED INWARDLY AND SAID HEAR ME O KING WHOEVER YOU MAY BE
AS ONE WHO HAS BEEN ALL DAY PLOUGHING A FALLOW FIELD WITH A COUPLE OF OXEN KEEPS THINKING ABOUT HIS SUPPER AND IS GLAD WHEN NIGHT COMES THAT HE MAY GO AND GET IT FOR IT IS ALL HIS LEGS CAN DO TO CARRY HIM
FIERCE AND FULL OF FURY NEVERTHELESS THOSE WHO WERE IN THE BODY OF THE COURT WERE STILL BOTH BRAVE AND MANY THEN
THIS IS ONLY SOME ONE OR OTHER OF THE GODS WHO IS LURING ME TO RUIN BY ADVISING ME TO QUIT MY RAFT AT ANY RATE I WILL NOT DO SO AT PRESENT FOR THE LAND WHERE SHE SAID I SHOULD BE QUIT OF ALL TROUBLES
AND THEN THEY MADE THE BEST OF THEIR WAY HOME AGAIN BUT NEPTUNE DID NOT FORGET THE THREATS WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY THREATENED ULYSSES SO HE TOOK COUNSEL WITH JOVE FATHER JOVE SAID HE
FROM HIS ARROWS LET US HAVE AT HIM WITH A RUSH TO DRIVE HIM FROM THE PAVEMENT AND DOORWAY WE CAN THEN GET THROUGH INTO THE TOWN AND RAISE SUCH AN ALARM AS SHALL SOON STAY HIS SHOOTING
HE EXCLAIMED AMONG WHAT MANNER OF PEOPLE AM I FALLEN ARE THEY SAVAGE AND UNCIVILISED OR HOSPITABLE AND HUMANE WHERE SHALL I PUT ALL THIS TREASURE AND WHICH WAY SHALL I GO
THAT HE HAS DONE IN YOUR HOUSE ULYSSES ANSWERED TELEMACHUS AND I WILL HOLD THESE SUITORS IN CHECK NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO
AND SEND HIS ARROW THROUGH EACH ONE OF TWELVE AXES HIM WILL I FOLLOW AND QUIT THIS HOUSE OF MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SO GOODLY AND SO ABOUNDING IN WEALTH BUT EVEN SO I DOUBT NOT THAT I SHALL REMEMBER IT IN MY DREAMS
LET US THEN SHOW FIGHT
TILL THEY ARE QUITE DEAD AND HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT LOVE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY USED TO LIE IN SECRET WITH THE SUITORS ON THIS THE WOMEN CAME DOWN IN A BODY WEEPING AND WAILING BITTERLY FIRST
LIKE THE TWITTERING OF A SWALLOW THE SUITORS WERE DISMAYED AND TURNED COLOUR AS THEY HEARD IT AT THAT MOMENT MOREOVER JOVE THUNDERED LOUDLY AS A SIGN AND THE HEART OF ULYSSES REJOICED AS HE HEARD THE OMEN
LET US NOW THEREFORE PRESENT HIM FURTHER EACH ONE OF US WITH A LARGE TRIPOD AND A CAULDRON WE WILL RECOUP OURSELVES BY THE LEVY OF A GENERAL RATE
AND ARMED HIMSELF FIRST WHILE THE STOCKMAN AND THE SWINEHERD ALSO PUT ON THEIR ARMOUR AND TOOK THEIR PLACES NEAR ULYSSES MEANWHILE ULYSSES AS LONG AS HIS ARROWS LASTED HAD BEEN SHOOTING THE SUITORS ONE BY ONE
SO THAT ALL HIS CREW WERE DROWNED WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS DRIVEN BY WIND AND WAVES ON TO MY ISLAND I GOT FOND OF HIM AND CHERISHED HIM AND HAD SET MY HEART ON MAKING HIM IMMORTAL SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER GROW OLD ALL HIS DAYS
SO SAYING SHE GAVE THE ROBE OVER TO HIM AND HE RECEIVED IT GLADLY
AND A QUEEN OR LADY OF THE MAY WAS APPOINTED AS IN FORMER TIMES TO PRESIDE AT THE SPORTS AND DISTRIBUTE THE PRIZES AND REWARDS
AND THE SOFT AIR THAT STOLE IN BROUGHT WITH IT THE FRAGRANCE OF THE CLUSTERING HONEYSUCKLE WHICH HER OWN HANDS HAD TRAINED ROUND THE WINDOW HER FATHER HAD JUST BEEN READING A CHAPTER IN THE BIBLE
THERE WERE THE OLD OBSTACLES WHICH SO INCESSANTLY OCCUR IN THESE HEEDLESS ATTACHMENTS HIS RANK IN LIFE THE PREJUDICES OF TITLED CONNECTIONS
BUT NEVER DESCRIBED CAN WE WONDER THAT THEY SHOULD READILY WIN A HEART YOUNG GUILELESS AND SUSCEPTIBLE AS TO HER SHE LOVED ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY
NOR DID HE MEET WITH A REPULSE FOR THERE ARE MOMENTS OF MINGLED SORROW AND TENDERNESS WHICH HALLOW THE CARESSES OF AFFECTION HE WAS NATURALLY IMPETUOUS
THE SUPERIORITY OF HER CHARMS WAS FELT AND ACKNOWLEDGED BY HER COMPANIONS BUT WITHOUT ENVY
AND WAS A PRIVILEGED VISITOR TO THEIR KITCHENS THE WHOLE TENOR OF HIS LIFE WAS QUIET AND INOFFENSIVE BEING PRINCIPALLY PASSED ABOUT THE NEIGHBORING STREAMS WHEN THE WEATHER AND SEASON WERE FAVORABLE AND AT OTHER TIMES HE EMPLOYED HIMSELF AT HOME
IT WAS THE SPOT WHERE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HAD BEEN BURIED I HAVE DONE FOR I FEAR THAT MY READER IS GROWING WEARY BUT I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM DRAWING THE PICTURE OF THIS WORTHY BROTHER OF THE ANGLE WHO HAS MADE ME MORE THAN EVER IN LOVE WITH THE THEORY
THE ESTABLISHMENT REMINDED ME OF THAT OF THE RENOWNED ROBINSON CRUSOE IT WAS KEPT IN NEAT ORDER EVERYTHING BEING STOWED AWAY WITH THE REGULARITY OF A SHIP OF WAR AND HE INFORMED ME THAT HE SCOURED THE DECK EVERY MORNING AND SWEPT IT BETWEEN MEALS
THE TEARS OF THE YOUTHFUL COMPANIONS OF THE DECEASED FLOWED UNRESTRAINED THE FATHER STILL SEEMED TO STRUGGLE WITH HIS FEELINGS
IT WAS EXTINGUISHED SHE WAS INCAPABLE OF ANGRY PASSIONS AND IN A MOMENT OF SADDENED TENDERNESS SHE PENNED HIM A FAREWELL LETTER
HE HAD BEGUN THE CONNECTION IN LEVITY FOR HE HAD OFTEN HEARD HIS BROTHER OFFICERS BOAST OF THEIR VILLAGE CONQUESTS
AND TO EXPLORE THE UNKNOWN REGIONS BEYOND THE DOOR YIELDED TO MY HAND WITH ALL THAT FACILITY WITH WHICH THE PORTALS OF ENCHANTED CASTLES YIELD TO THE ADVENTUROUS KNIGHT ERRANT I FOUND MYSELF IN A SPACIOUS CHAMBER SURROUNDED WITH GREAT CASES OF VENERABLE BOOKS
WHAT CAN BE MORE AFFECTING AT THAT SIMPLE BUT MOST SOLEMN CONSIGNMENT OF THE BODY TO THE GRAVE EARTH TO EARTH ASHES TO ASHES DUST TO DUST
BUT TOOK A SLEEVE FROM ONE A CAPE FROM ANOTHER A SKIRT FROM A THIRD THUS DECKING HIMSELF OUT PIECEMEAL WHILE SOME OF HIS ORIGINAL RAGS WOULD PEEP OUT FROM AMONG HIS BORROWED FINERY THERE WAS A PORTLY ROSY WELL FED PARSON
WHEN HE GAVE HER THE INTELLIGENCE IN THE COURSE OF AN EVENING RAMBLE THE IDEA OF PARTING HAD NEVER BEFORE OCCURRED TO HER IT BROKE IN AT ONCE UPON HER DREAM OF FELICITY
THE ARTLESSNESS OF RURAL HABITS ENABLED HIM READILY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE HE GRADUALLY WON HIS WAY INTO HER INTIMACY
THE POOR GIRL GAVE A FAINT EXCLAMATION AND SUNK BACK IN HER CHAIR IT WAS HER REPENTANT LOVER HE RUSHED INTO THE HOUSE AND FLEW TO CLASP HER TO HIS BOSOM
SOMETIMES BRIMMING ALONG THROUGH RICH PASTURAGE WHERE THE FRESH GREEN IS MINGLED WITH SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS SOMETIMES VENTURING IN SIGHT OF VILLAGES AND HAMLETS AND THEN RUNNING CAPRICIOUSLY AWAY INTO SHADY RETIREMENTS THE SWEETNESS AND SERENITY OF NATURE
WHILE I LAY ON THE GRASS AND BUILT CASTLES IN A BRIGHT PILE OF CLOUDS UNTIL I FELL ASLEEP ALL THIS MAY APPEAR LIKE MERE EGOTISM YET I CANNOT REFRAIN FROM UTTERING THESE RECOLLECTIONS WHICH ARE PASSING LIKE A STRAIN OF MUSIC OVER MY MIND
SO TENDER AND CONFIDING THERE WAS A PURITY IN HER MANNERS A BLAMELESSNESS IN HER LIFE
LET US NOT THEN LAMENT OVER THE DECAY AND OBLIVION INTO WHICH ANCIENT WRITERS DESCEND
HIS FACE BORE THE MARKS OF FORMER STORMS BUT PRESENT FAIR WEATHER ITS FURROWS HAD BEEN WORN INTO AN HABITUAL SMILE HIS IRON GRAY LOCKS HUNG ABOUT HIS EARS
IN THE BOSOM OF A MOUNTAIN WHICH OPENED ONLY ONCE A YEAR WHERE HE MADE THE SPIRITS OF THE PLACE BRING HIM BOOKS OF ALL KINDS OF DARK KNOWLEDGE SO THAT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN THE MAGIC PORTAL ONCE MORE SWUNG OPEN ON ITS HINGES HE ISSUED FORTH SO VERSED IN FORBIDDEN LORE
A MOST UNFORTUNATE PLACE FOR THE EXECUTION OF THOSE PISCATORY TACTICS WHICH HAD BEEN INVENTED ALONG THE VELVET MARGINS OF QUIET ENGLISH RIVULETS IT WAS ONE OF THOSE WILD STREAMS THAT LAVISH AMONG OUR ROMANTIC SOLITUDES
SHE BECAME FERVENT IN HER DEVOTIONS AT CHURCH AND AS THE OLD PEOPLE SAW HER APPROACH SO WASTED AWAY YET WITH A HECTIC GLOOM AND THAT HALLOWED AIR WHICH MELANCHOLY DIFFUSES ROUND THE FORM
AND DEVOTED THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE TO THE NOBLE ART OF ANGLING
BUT THEY INTERESTED ME STRONGLY AT THE TIME AND TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE AFFECTING CEREMONY WHICH I HAD JUST WITNESSED LEFT A DEEPER IMPRESSION ON MY MIND
WHO WAS SCRAMBLING AWAY IN SORE AFFRIGHT WITH HALF A SCORE OF AUTHORS IN FULL CRY AFTER HIM THEY WERE CLOSE UPON HIS HAUNCHES IN A TWINKLING OFF WENT HIS WIG AT EVERY TURN SOME STRIP OF RAIMENT WAS PEELED AWAY UNTIL IN A FEW MOMENTS FROM HIS DOMINEERING POMP
SHE SCARCELY INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE GROWING PASSION THAT WAS ABSORBING EVERY THOUGHT AND FEELING OR WHAT WERE TO BE ITS CONSEQUENCES SHE INDEED
AND I'LL WARRANT COULD FIND HIS WAY TO ANY GENTLEMAN'S FISH POND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE DARKEST NIGHT THE OTHER WAS A TALL AWKWARD COUNTRY LAD WITH A LOUNGING GAIT AND APPARENTLY SOMEWHAT OF A RUSTIC BEAU THE OLD MAN WAS BUSY IN EXAMINING THE MAW OF A TROUT
JUST BY A SPRING OF PURE SWEET WATER THAT STOLE OUT OF THE SIDE OF A HILL
IT IS DELIGHTFUL TO SAUNTER ALONG THOSE LIMPID STREAMS WHICH WANDER LIKE VEINS OF SILVER THROUGH THE BOSOM OF THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY LEADING ONE THROUGH A DIVERSITY OF SMALL HOME SCENERY SOMETIMES WINDING THROUGH ORNAMENTED GROUNDS
AND THE SPECIES CONTINUE TO FLOURISH THUS ALSO DO AUTHORS BEGET AUTHORS AND HAVING PRODUCED A NUMEROUS PROGENY IN A GOOD OLD AGE THEY SLEEP WITH THEIR FATHERS THAT IS TO SAY WITH THE AUTHORS WHO PRECEDED THEM AND FROM WHOM THEY HAD STOLEN
HER PARENTS WERE GAZING ON HER WITH YEARNING HEARTS SICKNESS AND SORROW WHICH PASS SO ROUGHLY OVER SOME FACES HAD GIVEN TO HERS THE EXPRESSION OF A SERAPH'S
IT SPOKE OF THE VANITY OF WORLDLY THINGS AND OF THE JOYS OF HEAVEN IT SEEMED TO HAVE DIFFUSED COMFORT AND SERENITY THROUGH HER BOSOM
AND THE QUIET WATCHFULNESS OF THE SPORT GRADUALLY BRING ON PLEASANT FITS OF MUSING WHICH ARE NOW AND THEN AGREEABLY INTERRUPTED BY THE SONG OF A BIRD THE DISTANT WHISTLE OF THE PEASANT OR PERHAPS THE VAGARY OF SOME FISH LEAPING OUT OF THE STILL WATER
WHICH TOGETHER WITH SOME SMALL PATERNAL PROPERTY BROUGHT HIM IN A REVENUE OF NEARLY FORTY POUNDS
BUT AS SOON AS THE WEATHER WAS AUSPICIOUS AND THAT THE SPRING BEGAN TO MELT INTO THE VERGE OF SUMMER WE TOOK ROD IN HAND AND SALLIED INTO THE COUNTRY AS STARK MAD AS WAS EVER DON QUIXOTE FROM READING BOOKS OF CHIVALRY
SHE LOOKED UP TO HIM AS TO A BEING OF A SUPERIOR ORDER SHE FELT IN HIS SOCIETY THE ENTHUSIASM OF A MIND NATURALLY DELICATE AND POETICAL
SHE APPEARED LIKE SOME TENDER PLANT OF THE GARDEN BLOOMING ACCIDENTALLY AMID THE HARDIER NATIVES OF THE FIELDS
SHE EVEN DEPICTED THE SUFFERINGS WHICH SHE HAD EXPERIENCED BUT CONCLUDED WITH SAYING THAT SHE COULD NOT DIE IN PEACE UNTIL SHE HAD SENT HIM HER FORGIVENESS
SHE WAS TOO FAINT TO RISE SHE ATTEMPTED TO EXTEND HER TREMBLING HAND HER LIPS MOVED AS IF SHE SPOKE
MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED METERS HIGH
MADE A SPECIAL STUDY OF THEM AND THESE ANIMALS FURNISHED MANY RIBALD
THE SHIPPING AND MERCANTILE GAZETTE THE LLOYD'S LIST FRANCE'S PACKETBOAT AND MARITIME AND COLONIAL REVIEW ALL THE RAGS DEVOTED TO INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO THREATENED TO RAISE THEIR PREMIUM RATES WERE UNANIMOUS ON THIS POINT
WHOSE ORIGIN I COULDN'T EVEN GUESS SO I HAD TO GIVE UP ANY NOTIONS OF QUESTIONING THEM THE NETS WERE HAULED ON BOARD
THE STUMPS OF THREE MASTS CHOPPED OFF TWO FEET ABOVE THE DECK INDICATED A FLOODING SHIP THAT HAD BEEN FORCED TO SACRIFICE ITS MASTING
AND LET ME PROCEED WITHOUT MAKING A SINGLE COMPLAINT IT WAS A HORRIBLE WOUND THE CRANIUM HAD BEEN SMASHED OPEN BY SOME BLUNT INSTRUMENT LEAVING THE NAKED BRAINS EXPOSED AND THE CEREBRAL MATTER HAD SUFFERED DEEP ABRASIONS
THE TOTAL IS THE SAME FINE CONSEIL REPLIED I'LL TAKE MASTER'S WORD FOR IT I WON'T COUNT THEM COUNT WHAT THOSE ELEVEN MILLION EGGS BUT I'LL MAKE ONE COMMENT
I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE MY COUNTRY AGAIN MY FRIENDS MY MODEST QUARTERS BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS MY DEARLY BELOVED COLLECTIONS BUT NOW NOTHING COULD HOLD ME BACK I FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE AND WITHOUT ANOTHER THOUGHT OF EXHAUSTION FRIENDS OR COLLECTIONS
THIS SQUADRON FOUGHT AN ENCOUNTER WITH ENGLISH VESSELS SIR TODAY IS JUNE FIRST EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT OR THE THIRTEENTH DAY IN THE MONTH OF PASTURE
ALL THESE OBJECTS LOST A PART OF THEIR WEIGHT EQUAL TO THE WEIGHT OF THE LIQUID THEY DISPLACED AND THANKS TO THIS LAW OF PHYSICS DISCOVERED BY ARCHIMEDES I DID JUST FINE
IT'S A CHINESE TRIGGERFISH NED LAND REPLIED GENUS BALISTES FAMILY SCLERODERMA ORDER PLECTOGNATHA CONSEIL MUTTERED
THEN SOME SEA POACHERS FISH BELONGING TO THE GENUS
FROM WHICH SOME CHORDS WERE WAFTING CAPTAIN NEMO WAS THERE LEANING OVER THE ORGAN DEEP IN A MUSICAL TRANCE CAPTAIN I SAID TO HIM HE DIDN'T HEAR ME CAPTAIN I WENT ON TOUCHING HIM WITH MY HAND
WORDS ARE POWERLESS TO DESCRIBE SUCH WONDERS WHEN EVEN THE PAINTER'S BRUSH CAN'T DEPICT THE EFFECTS UNIQUE TO THE LIQUID ELEMENT HOW CAN THE WRITER'S PEN HOPE TO REPRODUCE THEM
AND THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD CHART A COURSE TOWARD EUROPEAN SEAS THIS PROMISE WAS GIVEN ON NOVEMBER SECOND IT HAD THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF REVIVING THE CREW'S FAILING SPIRITS THE OCEAN WAS OBSERVED WITH RENEWED CARE
IT'S A GLORIOUS MISSION BUT ALSO A DANGEROUS ONE
WORKING HIMSELF CAPTAIN NEMO PASSED NEAR ME JUST THEN I TOUCHED HIM WITH MY HAND AND POINTED TO THE WALLS OF OUR PRISON THE STARBOARD WALL HAD MOVED FORWARD TO A POINT LESS THAN FOUR METERS FROM THE NAUTILUS'S HULL
AND STARFISH THAT SPANGLED THE SAND INCLUDING VEINLIKE FEATHER STARS FROM THE GENUS ASTEROPHYTON THAT WERE LIKE FINE LACE EMBROIDERED BY THE HANDS OF WATER NYMPHS
AN UNDERWATER FOREST WE HAD FINALLY ARRIVED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS FOREST
PRETTY FAIR EATING NED LAND REPLIED SECUNDO CONSEIL WENT ON THE ABDOMINALS WHOSE PELVIC FINS HANG UNDER THE ABDOMEN TO THE REAR OF THE PECTORALS
SO AFTER INQUIRIES CONDUCTED IN ENGLAND FRANCE RUSSIA PRUSSIA SPAIN ITALY AMERICA AND EVEN TURKEY THE HYPOTHESIS OF AN UNDERWATER MONITOR WAS ULTIMATELY REJECTED AND SO THE MONSTER SURFACED AGAIN
CAPTAIN NEMO LED ME TO THE GALLEY WHERE A HUGE DISTILLING MECHANISM WAS AT WORK SUPPLYING DRINKING WATER VIA EVAPORATION THE MECHANISM WAS LOADED WITH WATER AND THE FULL ELECTRIC HEAT OF OUR BATTERIES WAS THROWN INTO COILS AWASH IN LIQUID
AND THE LOG GAVE OUR SPEED AS TWENTY MILES PER HOUR OVER
AND WHEN I LIFTED MY ARMS SOMETIMES THEY WOULD PASS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SEA THEN THE LEVEL OF THE OYSTERBANK WOULD LOWER UNPREDICTABLY OFTEN WE WENT AROUND TALL POINTED ROCKS RISING LIKE PYRAMIDS
THEY SWAM BACKWARD WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED MOVING BY MEANS OF THEIR LOCOMOTIVE TUBES
PAST THE BOUNDARIES OF THE CLEARING THE DARKNESS DEEPENED AGAIN RELIEVED ONLY BY LITTLE SPARKLES GIVEN OFF BY THE SHARP CRESTS OF CORAL NED LAND AND CONSEIL STOOD NEXT TO ME
WERE ATTACHED TO THE SEAFLOOR BY ONLY THE MOST MAKESHIFT METHODS THEY HAD NO ROOTS AND DIDN'T CARE WHICH SOLID OBJECTS SECURED THEM SAND SHELLS HUSKS OR PEBBLES THEY DIDN'T ASK THEIR HOSTS FOR SUSTENANCE
JUST THEN I HEARD INDISTINCT CHORDS FROM THE ORGAN MELANCHOLY HARMONIES FROM SOME UNDEFINABLE HYMN ACTUAL PLEADINGS FROM A SOUL TRYING TO SEVER ITS EARTHLY TIES
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS IT NEEDED TO DISPLACE ONLY NINE TENTHS OF ITS VOLUME HENCE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX POINT FOUR EIGHT CUBIC METERS IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS TO WEIGH ONLY THAT SAME NUMBER OF METRIC TONS
BECAUSE THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK HERE FOR A CLASSIFIER OF YOUR TALENTS CONSEIL NEEDED NO ENCOURAGING BENDING OVER THE GLASS CASES THE GALLANT LAD WAS ALREADY MUTTERING CHOICE WORDS FROM THE NATURALIST'S VOCABULARY
FOR A FARE OF TWENTY FRANCS THE VEHICLE WENT DOWN BROADWAY TO UNION SQUARE
THESE PERFECTED DIVING SUITS IT WAS EASY TO SEE WERE A FAR CRY FROM SUCH MISSHAPEN COSTUMES AS THE CORK BREASTPLATES LEATHER JUMPERS SEAGOING TUNICS
THAT INHABIT STRATA BEYOND THE REACH OF OUR SOUNDINGS AND WHICH SOME DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER AN URGE OR A WHIM IF YOU PREFER CAN BRING TO THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE OCEAN FOR LONG INTERVALS IF ON THE OTHER HAND WE DO KNOW EVERY LIVING SPECIES
WHO HAD RISKED HIS WHOLE FORTUNE TO PROMOTE THIS UNDERTAKING CALLED FOR A NEW BOND ISSUE IT SOLD OUT IMMEDIATELY
AND GLUING HIS HUGE COPPER CAPSULE TO MINE HIS EYES GAVE ME A FRIENDLY GREETING BUT THIS LOFTY PLATEAU MEASURED ONLY A FEW FATHOMS AND SOON WE REENTERED OUR ELEMENT I THINK I'VE NOW EARNED THE RIGHT TO DUB IT THAT TEN MINUTES LATER
I TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE WOUNDED MAN THEN I REPLIED THIS MAN WILL BE DEAD IN TWO HOURS NOTHING CAN SAVE HIM NOTHING
THESE BEARINGS DETERMINED THE FRIGATE TOOK A MORE DECISIVE WESTWARD HEADING AND TACKLED THE SEAS OF THE CENTRAL PACIFIC COMMANDER FARRAGUT FELT AND WITH GOOD REASON THAT IT WAS BEST TO STAY IN DEEP WATERS AND KEEP HIS DISTANCE FROM CONTINENTS OR ISLANDS
SHAKING HIS HEAD IN FACT I SAID MISTER LAND IS RIGHT AND IF WE EVER BROUGHT BACK TO EUROPE OR AMERICA A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS IT WOULD MAKE THE STORY OF OUR ADVENTURES MORE AUTHENTIC AND MUCH MORE REWARDING THAT'S HOW I SEE IT
THEN HIS OPERATIONS FINISHED HE WENT AND LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE BEACON HOUSING HIS EYES STRAYING OVER THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN MEANWHILE SOME TWENTY OF THE NAUTILUS'S SAILORS ALL ENERGETIC WELL BUILT FELLOWS CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
ITS AVERAGE DEPTH WOULD BE ABOUT SEVEN KILOMETERS WELL PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED WE'LL SHOW YOU BETTER THAN THAT I HOPE AS FOR THE AVERAGE DEPTH OF THIS PART OF THE PACIFIC I'LL INFORM YOU THAT IT'S A MERE FOUR THOUSAND METERS
TWO DAYS PASSED THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN STAYED AT HALF STEAM
I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE DREADING YET DESIRING AN ENCOUNTER WITH CAPTAIN NEMO WANTING YET NOT WANTING TO SEE HIM WHAT WOULD I SAY TO HIM HOW COULD I HIDE THE INVOLUNTARY HORROR HE INSPIRED IN ME NO
BUT IN EXCHANGE I EXPERIENCED THAT IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE FOR SLEEP THAT COMES OVER EVERY DIVER ACCORDINGLY MY EYES SOON CLOSED BEHIND THEIR HEAVY GLASS WINDOWS
WHERE TREE TRUNKS ARE WORN DOWN AND WORKED INTO A SHAGGY FUR AS NORWEGIANS EXPRESS IT WHAT A PREDICAMENT WE WERE ROCKING FRIGHTFULLY THE NAUTILUS DEFENDED ITSELF LIKE A HUMAN BEING
THAT AN INVOLUNTARY TERROR SWEEPS OVER ME AND MY LUNGS STILL SEEM SHORT OF AIR MEANWHILE
THE SUN ASTONISHED ME WITH ITS POWER THE SOLAR RAYS EASILY CROSSED THIS AQUEOUS MASS AND DISPERSED ITS DARK COLORS I COULD EASILY DISTINGUISH OBJECTS ONE HUNDRED METERS AWAY FARTHER ON
SOMEONE CUT OUT THIS MESSAGE WITH A SCISSORS NAIL SCISSORS SAID HOLMES YOU CAN SEE THAT IT WAS A VERY SHORT BLADED SCISSORS SINCE THE CUTTER HAD TO TAKE TWO SNIPS OVER KEEP AWAY THAT
AFTER THE CONVERSATION WHICH I HAVE QUOTED ABOUT BARRYMORE SIR HENRY PUT ON HIS HAT AND PREPARED TO GO OUT AS A MATTER OF COURSE I DID THE SAME WHAT ARE YOU COMING WATSON HE ASKED
YOU HAVE LOST ONE OF YOUR BOOTS MY DEAR SIR CRIED DOCTOR MORTIMER IT IS ONLY MISLAID YOU WILL FIND IT WHEN YOU RETURN TO THE HOTEL WHAT IS THE USE OF TROUBLING MISTER HOLMES WITH TRIFLES OF
YOUR REQUEST IS A VERY REASONABLE ONE HOLMES ANSWERED DOCTOR MORTIMER I THINK YOU COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN TO TELL YOUR STORY AS YOU TOLD IT TO US THUS ENCOURAGED OUR SCIENTIFIC FRIEND
HERE ARE TWENTY THREE SHILLINGS
I WAS AT A LOSS WHAT TO SAY OR WHAT TO DO
HAD OBEYED THE SUMMONS OF THE MANAGER HE STOOD NOW GAZING WITH GREAT REVERENCE AT THE FAMOUS DETECTIVE LET ME HAVE THE HOTEL DIRECTORY SAID HOLMES THANK YOU NOW CARTWRIGHT
WE HAD BEEN SAUNTERING SLOWLY DOWN REGENT STREET DURING THIS CONVERSATION AND DOCTOR MORTIMER WITH HIS COMPANION HAD LONG VANISHED IN FRONT OF US
THERE ARE PRETTY CLEAR SIGNS THAT THIS WILL NOT BE WANTING IF THE LADY IS WILLING FOR I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A MAN MORE INFATUATED WITH A WOMAN THAN HE IS WITH OUR BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBOUR MISS STAPLETON
NOTHING AT ALL THE BUTLER BROKE IN I ASSURE YOU SIR MOVE YOUR LIGHT ACROSS THE WINDOW WATSON CRIED THE BARONET SEE THE OTHER MOVES ALSO
IF SHE HAD TO LEAVE HIM HE HAD RATHER IT WAS TO A NEIGHBOUR LIKE MYSELF THAN TO ANYONE ELSE BUT IN ANY CASE IT WAS A BLOW TO HIM AND IT WOULD TAKE HIM SOME TIME BEFORE HE COULD PREPARE HIMSELF TO MEET IT HE WOULD WITHDRAW ALL OPPOSITION UPON HIS PART
WE CANNOT LET HIM PERISH AT OUR VERY GATES THE LIGHT IS A SIGNAL TO HIM THAT FOOD IS READY FOR HIM AND HIS LIGHT OUT YONDER IS TO SHOW THE SPOT TO WHICH TO BRING IT THEN YOUR BROTHER IS THE ESCAPED CONVICT SIR SELDEN THE CRIMINAL
THAT AN IMPORTANT TELEGRAM HAS MISCARRIED AND THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IT YOU UNDERSTAND YES SIR
WE HAD RISEN FROM OUR ROCKS AND WERE TURNING TO GO HOME HAVING ABANDONED THE HOPELESS CHASE THE MOON WAS LOW UPON THE RIGHT AND THE JAGGED PINNACLE OF A GRANITE TOR STOOD UP AGAINST THE LOWER CURVE OF ITS SILVER DISC
MY DEAR WATSON CLUMSY AS I HAVE BEEN YOU SURELY DO NOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE THAT I NEGLECTED TO GET THE NUMBER
WHY OF COURSE THAT WOULD EXPLAIN IT HAVE YOU READ ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS MESSAGE MISTER HOLMES THERE ARE ONE OR TWO INDICATIONS AND YET THE UTMOST PAINS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO REMOVE ALL CLUES
AS TO MY UNCLE'S DEATH WELL IT ALL SEEMS BOILING UP IN MY HEAD AND I CAN'T GET IT CLEAR YET YOU DON'T SEEM QUITE TO HAVE MADE UP YOUR MIND WHETHER IT'S A CASE FOR A POLICEMAN OR A CLERGYMAN PRECISELY
ON OBSERVING THE CAB I SHOULD HAVE INSTANTLY TURNED AND WALKED IN THE OTHER DIRECTION I SHOULD THEN AT MY LEISURE HAVE HIRED A SECOND CAB AND FOLLOWED THE FIRST AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE
BUT IT STANDS TO REASON THAT SUCH LEGISLATION MUST IN THE LONG RUN KEEP AWAY WEALTH FROM THE COUNTRY DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR IMPORTS AND LOWER THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OF LIFE IN THIS ISLAND
I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU NOW SUGGEST SAID I HE WOULD FOLLOW BARRYMORE AND SEE WHAT HE DID THEN WE SHALL DO IT TOGETHER BUT SURELY HE WOULD HEAR US THE MAN IS RATHER DEAF AND IN ANY CASE
LIFE FOR EXAMPLE IS QUITE OUT OF ITS PROPER PLACE THAT MAY POINT TO CARELESSNESS OR IT MAY POINT TO AGITATION AND HURRY UPON THE PART OF THE CUTTER ON THE WHOLE I INCLINE TO THE LATTER VIEW SINCE THE MATTER WAS EVIDENTLY IMPORTANT
WELL OF COURSE THAT IS POSSIBLE ALSO I AM VERY MUCH INDEBTED TO YOU DOCTOR MORTIMER FOR INTRODUCING ME TO A PROBLEM WHICH PRESENTS SEVERAL INTERESTING ALTERNATIVES
AND IF THERE WAS AN ANSWER MY HUSBAND TOOK OUT SOME BREAD AND MEAT TO HIM EVERY DAY WE HOPED THAT HE WAS GONE BUT AS LONG AS HE WAS THERE WE COULD NOT DESERT HIM THAT IS THE WHOLE TRUTH AS I AM AN HONEST CHRISTIAN WOMAN AND YOU WILL SEE THAT IF THERE IS BLAME IN THE MATTER
WHO OFFERED EXPLANATIONS WHICH BECAME MORE ANGRY AS THE OTHER REFUSED TO ACCEPT THEM THE LADY STOOD BY IN HAUGHTY SILENCE FINALLY STAPLETON TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND BECKONED IN A PEREMPTORY WAY TO HIS SISTER WHO
MIGHT I TROUBLE YOU FOR IT THE INSIDE PAGE PLEASE WITH THE LEADING ARTICLES HE GLANCED SWIFTLY OVER IT RUNNING HIS EYES UP AND DOWN THE COLUMNS CAPITAL ARTICLE THIS ON FREE TRADE PERMIT ME TO GIVE YOU AN EXTRACT FROM IT
JUST ABOUT THE HOUR YOU NAME PERHAPS THEN HE PAYS A VISIT EVERY NIGHT TO THAT PARTICULAR WINDOW I SUGGESTED PERHAPS HE DOES IF SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHADOW HIM AND SEE WHAT IT IS THAT HE IS AFTER I WONDER WHAT YOUR FRIEND HOLMES WOULD DO IF HE WERE HERE
A BOULDER OF GRANITE CONCEALED OUR APPROACH AND CROUCHING BEHIND IT WE GAZED OVER IT AT THE SIGNAL LIGHT IT WAS STRANGE TO SEE THIS SINGLE CANDLE BURNING THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOOR WITH NO SIGN OF LIFE NEAR IT JUST THE ONE STRAIGHT YELLOW FLAME
WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT I WAS NOT THE ONLY WITNESS OF THEIR INTERVIEW A WISP OF GREEN FLOATING IN THE AIR CAUGHT MY EYE AND ANOTHER GLANCE SHOWED ME THAT IT WAS CARRIED ON A STICK BY A MAN WHO WAS MOVING AMONG THE BROKEN GROUND
REALLY MISTER HOLMES THIS EXCEEDS ANYTHING WHICH I COULD HAVE IMAGINED SAID DOCTOR MORTIMER GAZING AT MY FRIEND IN AMAZEMENT I COULD UNDERSTAND ANYONE SAYING THAT THE WORDS WERE FROM A NEWSPAPER
I WAS DOING NO HARM SIR I WAS HOLDING A CANDLE TO THE WINDOW AND WHY WERE YOU HOLDING A CANDLE TO THE WINDOW DON'T ASK ME SIR HENRY DON'T ASK ME I GIVE YOU MY WORD SIR THAT IT IS NOT MY SECRET AND THAT I CANNOT TELL IT
I ALWAYS THOUGHT HIM SANE ENOUGH UNTIL TODAY BUT YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM ME THAT EITHER HE OR I OUGHT TO BE IN A STRAITJACKET WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME ANYHOW YOU'VE LIVED NEAR ME FOR SOME WEEKS WATSON TELL ME STRAIGHT NOW
SUPPOSE YOU AND YOUR FRIEND DOCTOR WATSON COME ROUND AND LUNCH WITH US AT TWO I'LL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU MORE CLEARLY THEN HOW THIS THING STRIKES ME
BUT THAT IS NO USE TO US FOR THE MOMENT
ONLY A JOKE AS LIKE AS NOT IT WAS THIS LETTER IF YOU CAN CALL IT A LETTER WHICH REACHED ME THIS MORNING HE LAID AN ENVELOPE UPON THE TABLE AND WE ALL BENT OVER IT
IS SO SOMEONE THEN CUT OUT THE MESSAGE WITH A PAIR OF SHORT BLADED SCISSORS PASTED IT WITH PASTE GUM SAID HOLMES
SAID DOCTOR MORTIMER AND ALSO SAID HOLMES THAT SOMEONE IS NOT ILL DISPOSED TOWARDS YOU SINCE THEY WARN YOU OF DANGER OR IT MAY BE THAT THEY WISH FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES TO SCARE ME AWAY
BUT NO SOUND OF ANY SORT DID WE HEAR EXCEPT THE CHIMING CLOCK UPON THE STAIRS IT WAS A MOST MELANCHOLY VIGIL AND ENDED BY EACH OF US FALLING ASLEEP IN OUR CHAIRS FORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT DISCOURAGED AND WE DETERMINED TO TRY AGAIN
I'D PREFER TO WALK FOR THIS AFFAIR HAS FLURRIED ME RATHER I'LL JOIN YOU IN A WALK WITH PLEASURE SAID HIS COMPANION THEN WE MEET AGAIN AT TWO O'CLOCK AU REVOIR AND GOOD MORNING
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT DOCTOR MORTIMER YOU MUST ALLOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL ABOUT THIS AT ANY RATE
YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED THAT I TWICE STROLLED OVER TO THE WINDOW WHILE DOCTOR MORTIMER WAS READING HIS LEGEND YES I REMEMBER I WAS LOOKING OUT FOR LOITERERS IN THE STREET BUT I SAW NONE
OR BETTER STILL HAVE DRIVEN TO THE NORTHUMBERLAND HOTEL AND WAITED THERE WHEN OUR UNKNOWN HAD FOLLOWED BASKERVILLE HOME WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF PLAYING HIS OWN GAME UPON HIMSELF AND SEEING WHERE HE MADE FOR
STRIDENT WILD AND MENACING THE BARONET CAUGHT MY SLEEVE AND HIS FACE GLIMMERED WHITE THROUGH THE DARKNESS MY GOD WHAT'S THAT WATSON I DON'T KNOW IT'S A SOUND THEY HAVE ON THE MOOR I HEARD IT ONCE BEFORE IT DIED AWAY
STILL I COULD SEE NO BETTER COURSE THAN TO OBSERVE HIM FROM THE HILL AND TO CLEAR MY CONSCIENCE BY CONFESSING TO HIM AFTERWARDS WHAT I HAD DONE IT IS TRUE THAT IF ANY SUDDEN DANGER HAD THREATENED HIM I WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO BE OF USE
TYPE OF A TIMES ARTICLE AND THE SLOVENLY PRINT OF AN EVENING HALF PENNY PAPER AS THERE COULD BE BETWEEN YOUR NEGRO AND YOUR ESQUIMAU THE DETECTION OF TYPES IS ONE OF THE MOST ELEMENTARY BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE TO THE SPECIAL EXPERT IN CRIME
THE DIFFERENCES ARE OBVIOUS THE SUPRA ORBITAL CREST THE FACIAL ANGLE THE MAXILLARY CURVE THE BUT THIS IS MY SPECIAL HOBBY AND THE DIFFERENCES ARE EQUALLY OBVIOUS THERE IS AS MUCH DIFFERENCE TO MY EYES BETWEEN THE LEADED BOURGEOIS
LOOKING AT ME IN A CURIOUS WAY THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU ARE GOING ON THE MOOR SAID I YES I AM
INDEED JUST AT THIS MOMENT
BUT IT WAS NOT QUITE SO EASY TO SAY WHAT LUDOVIC MIGHT DO OR THINK BUT LADY LUFTON WENT ON I AM SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND ME FANNY WITH YOUR EXCELLENT SENSE AND TACT LUCY IS CLEVER AND AMUSING AND ALL THAT
NOT MORE THAN I SHALL GET AGAIN SAID MARK
BUT ALWAYS WITH A MUTUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF EACH OTHER'S TRUTH NOW THEY LIVED COMPARATIVELY NEAR TOGETHER BUT NO OPPORTUNITIES AROSE FOR SUCH DISCUSSIONS AT ANY RATE ONCE A QUARTER MISTER CRAWLEY WAS PRESSED BY HIS OLD FRIEND TO VISIT HIM AT THE DEANERY
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GENTLEMAN IS VERY RICH AND A LORD AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING NOBODY FOR A MOMENT ATTRIBUTES ANYTHING WRONG TO YOU LUCY ANYTHING WRONG NO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD BE ANYTHING WRONG EVEN IF I WERE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM
THEY THEN WALKED UP TO THE HALL DOOR IN SILENCE WHEN THEY HAD REACHED IT LUCY STOOD IN THE DOORWAY INSTEAD OF ENTERING IT AND SAID FANNY LET US TAKE ANOTHER TURN TOGETHER IF YOU ARE NOT TIRED NO I'M NOT TIRED
SHE HAD DECLARED TO HIM PLAINLY THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM AND COULD NOT LOVE HIM AND HAD THUS THROWN AWAY NOT ONLY RICHES AND HONOUR AND HIGH STATION BUT MORE THAN THAT MUCH WORSE THAN THAT SHE HAD FLUNG AWAY FROM HER THE LOVER TO WHOSE LOVE HER WARM HEART CLUNG
AND THAT THE PURCHASING OF A HUNTER WITH THE VIEW OF IMMEDIATELY SELLING HIM AGAIN WAS TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT AN OPERATION HARDLY CONGENIAL WITH THE USUAL TASTES AND PURSUITS OF A CLERGYMAN I HOPE YOU DID NOT GIVE VERY MUCH MONEY FOR HIM MARK SAID FANNY
THAT HER LOVE DID CLING TO HIM SHE KNEW EVEN THEN AND OWNED MORE THOROUGHLY AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE SO MUCH HER PRIDE HAD DONE FOR HER AND THAT STRONG RESOLVE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD NOT SCOWL ON HER AND TELL HER THAT SHE HAD ENTRAPPED HER SON
AS TO MAKE HER SISTER IN LAW QUITE SURE THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO LOVE PASSAGES UP TO THAT TIME AND NOTHING HAD SINCE OCCURRED WHICH HAD CREATED ANY SUSPICION IN MISSUS ROBARTS MIND SHE HAD SEEN AT ONCE THAT ALL THE CLOSE INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM WAS OVER AND THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
BUT THERE ARE MEN MADE OF SUCH STUFF THAT AN ANGEL COULD HARDLY LIVE WITH THEM WITHOUT SOME DECEIT PAPA'S GONE NOW WHISPERED BOBBY I SAW HIM TURN ROUND THE CORNER HE AT ANY RATE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON AS IT WAS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD DO
THAT A MATCH WAS POSSIBLE BETWEEN LORD LUFTON AND LUCY ROBARTS NOR HAD SHE THE SLIGHTEST WISH TO ENCOURAGE IT NOW THAT THE IDEA WAS SUGGESTED TO HER ON SUCH A MATTER SHE COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH LADY LUFTON THOUGH SHE DID NOT COMPLETELY AGREE WITH HER
MAKING USE OF THE EXCUSE COMMON ON ALL SUCH OCCASIONS THERE IS ONE OF JUSTINIA'S IN THE HOUSE I KNOW SHE ALWAYS LEAVES ONE HERE IN ORDER THAT SHE MAY BE ABLE TO RIDE WHEN SHE COMES SHE WOULD NOT THINK OF TAKING SUCH A LIBERTY WITH LADY MEREDITH'S THINGS
AND WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT SHE HAD FELT THE AIR OF THE WHOLE PLACE TO BE VERY COLD BEFORE HER INTIMACY WITH HIM AND NOW IT MUST BE COLD AGAIN TWO HOMES HAD BEEN OPEN TO HER FRAMLEY COURT AND THE PARSONAGE
BUT YOUNG LADIES SOMETIMES ALLOW THEMSELVES TO FALL IN LOVE AND THEN TO THINK THEMSELVES VERY ILL USED JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD NO IDEA IN THEIR HEAD I WILL PUT HER ON HER GUARD IF YOU WISH IT LADY LUFTON EXACTLY MY DEAR
SHE HAD WISHED TO SAY SOMETHING WHICH WOULD CONVEY TO HER SISTER IN LAW AN IDEA OF WHAT LADY LUFTON WOULD DISLIKE BUT IN DOING SO SHE HAD UNINTENTIONALLY BROUGHT AGAINST HER AN ACCUSATION FLIRTING FANNY SAID LUCY
MOVING A PILE OF RAGGED COVERLESS BOOKS ON TO THE TABLE I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME FOR MOVING THEM THEY ARE NOT BOB'S AT LEAST NOT THE MOST OF THEM BUT MINE SAID THE GIRL BUT SOME OF THEM ARE MINE SAID THE BOY AIN'T THEY GRACE
JUST EXPLAIN TO HER THAT ANY YOUNG LADY WHO TALKS SO MUCH TO THE SAME YOUNG GENTLEMAN WILL CERTAINLY BE OBSERVED THAT PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE HER OF SETTING HER CAP AT LORD LUFTON NOT THAT I SUSPECT HER I GIVE HER CREDIT FOR TOO MUCH PROPER FEELING
WHICH SHE KNEW WAS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THAT ORDINARY COMFORTABLE MASCULINE FRIENDSHIP WITH THE IDEA OF WHICH SHE HAD ONCE SATISFIED HERSELF WAS NOT FANNY RIGHT WHEN SHE SAID THAT INTIMATE FRIENDSHIPS OF THAT NATURE WERE DANGEROUS THINGS
AND NOW AS FAR AS COMFORT WAS CONCERNED SHE MUST CONFINE HERSELF TO THE LATTER SHE COULD NOT AGAIN BE COMFORTABLE IN LADY LUFTON'S DRAWING ROOM BUT THEN SHE COULD NOT HELP ASKING HERSELF WHETHER LADY LUFTON WAS NOT RIGHT
OH NO I COULD NOT PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR GOODNESS IN THAT WAY BUT HE WOULD NOT GO HE COULD GO AND LEAVE ME AT HOME SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE SO AND I HAVE DONE ALL IN MY POWER TO PERSUADE HIM I HAVE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD MIX ONCE MORE WITH THE WORLD WITH THE CLERICAL WORLD YOU KNOW
LET IT BE EVER SO SLIGHT WOULD BRING HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES AND THEN IT MIGHT BE A QUESTION WHETHER YOU COULD GET HIM ANOTHER MILE THAT DAY SO THAT ON THE WHOLE LADY LUFTON THOUGHT THAT THE OTHER PLAN WOULD BE THE BEST I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT LADY LUFTON WAS RIGHT
SUCH THINGS ARE SO MUCH WORSE FOR A MAN THAN FOR A WOMAN FANNY WAS NOT QUITE PREPARED TO ADMIT THIS IN HER OWN HEART BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY ON THAT HEAD I AM SURE I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO BE OF USE TO YOU SHE SAID IF YOU WILL ONLY LOOK UPON ME AS AN OLD FRIEND AND WRITE TO ME IF YOU WANT ME
FANNY WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK HOW VERY DIFFERENT THOSE TWO ARE SHE SAID DIFFERENT IN THEIR MINDS AND IN THEIR SPIRIT BUT HOW MUCH HIGHER TONED IS HER MIND THAN HIS HOW WEAK HE IS IN MANY THINGS AND HOW STRONG SHE IS IN EVERYTHING
AS REGARDS THE MERE EATING AND DRINKING THE AMOUNTS OF BUTCHER'S MEAT AND TEA AND BUTTER THEY OF COURSE WERE USED IN QUANTITIES WHICH ANY ARTISAN WOULD HAVE REGARDED AS COMPATIBLE ONLY WITH DEMI STARVATION BETTER CLOTHING FOR HER CHILDREN WAS NECESSARY AND BETTER CLOTHING FOR HIM
AT THE END OF THE LAST CHAPTER WE LEFT LUCY ROBARTS WAITING FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO MISSUS CRAWLEY WHO WAS SITTING WITH ONE BABY IN HER LAP WHILE SHE WAS ROCKING ANOTHER WHO LAY IN A CRADLE AT HER FEET MISTER CRAWLEY IN THE MEANWHILE HAD RISEN FROM HIS SEAT WITH HIS FINGER BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF AN OLD GRAMMAR
STANDING STILL IN THE PATH AND LOOKING UP INTO HER COMPANION'S FACE WITH ALL HER EYES
LUCY ROBARTS IN HER HEART DID NOT GIVE HER DISMISSED LOVER CREDIT FOR MUCH MORE HEROISM THAN DID TRULY APPERTAIN TO HIM DID NOT PERHAPS GIVE HIM FULL CREDIT FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HEROISM WHICH DID REALLY APPERTAIN TO HIM
I DID VENTURE TO BRING THEM SAID FANNY WITH A LOOK OF SHAME FOR I KNOW HOW A SICK CHILD OCCUPIES THE WHOLE HOUSE AH MY FRIEND SAID MISSUS CRAWLEY TAKING HOLD OF MISSUS ROBARTS ARM AND LOOKING INTO HER FACE THAT SORT OF SHAME IS OVER WITH ME
BUT YOU SEE WHEN ONE IS TRUSTED WITH A WHIP ONE FEELS SUCH A LONGING TO USE IT OH BUT YOU SHOULD KEEP IT STILL I FEEL ALMOST CERTAIN THAT LADY LUFTON WOULD LIKE SUCH A MATCH I DARESAY SHE MIGHT MISS GRANTLY WILL HAVE A LARGE FORTUNE I BELIEVE
THIS WAS VERY DISCOURAGING TO LUCY IF ONE SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS CREATED SO GREAT A DIFFICULTY HOW WAS SHE TO DISPOSE OF THE POT OF GUAVA JELLY AND BOX OF BONBONS WHICH WERE STILL IN HER MUFF OR HOW DISTRIBUTE THE PACKET OF ORANGES WITH WHICH THE PONY CARRIAGE WAS LADEN
HAD YOU HEARD WHAT SHE SAID YOU WOULD HARDLY HAVE FELT ANGRY WITH LADY LUFTON WELL TO CAUTION ME
THEREFORE I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IF THEY BECOME MAN AND WIFE HOWEVER
TOO MUCH FRIGHTENED AND LASTLY IT IS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR A GREAT MANY OTHER VERY GOOD REASONS NONSENSE SAID LORD LUFTON A GREAT DEAL OF NONSENSE SAID LUCY LAUGHING BUT ALL OF IT OF LORD LUFTON'S TALKING
BUT WHAT CAN I DO I FEAR THAT HE REGARDS THE RICH AS HIS ENEMIES HE IS PINING FOR THE SOLACE OF SOME FRIEND TO WHOM HE COULD TALK FOR SOME EQUAL WITH A MIND EDUCATED LIKE HIS OWN TO WHOSE THOUGHTS HE COULD LISTEN AND TO WHOM HE COULD SPEAK HIS OWN THOUGHTS
AND INDEED LADY LUFTON HAD A WORD OR TWO TO SAY ON THAT SUBJECT ALSO ONLY NOT EXACTLY NOW A HUNTING PARSON WAS NOT AT ALL TO HER TASTE BUT THAT MATTER MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN ABEYANCE FOR A FEW DAYS
WHICH THEY KNEW IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE IN MISTER CRAWLEY'S PRESENCE SHE AS WE HAVE SAID WAS NOT QUITE SO GAUNT NOT ALTOGETHER SO HAGGARD AS IN THE LATTER OF THOSE DREADFUL CORNISH DAYS LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ARABIN BETWEEN THEM
IF I COULD ONLY DO SOMETHING FOR MY POOR GRACE IN ANSWER TO THIS MISSUS ROBARTS SAID A WORD OR TWO BUT NOT MUCH SHE RESOLVED HOWEVER THAT IF SHE COULD GET HER HUSBAND'S LEAVE SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE FOR GRACE
FOR SHE HAD WORK OF THIS KIND OF HER OWN AT HOME WHICH SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF NURSES WAS MORE PLENTIFUL WITH HER THAN AT HOGGLESTOCK MISSUS CRAWLEY DID GET UP AND TOLD LUCY THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND MISTER CRAWLEY CAME FORWARD GRAMMAR IN HAND LOOKING HUMBLE AND MEEK
HASTE AND SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND MEN RUNNING TO AND FRO WITH BLANK ACCEPTANCES IN THEIR HANDS COULD ALONE STAVE OFF THE CRACK OF DOOM BUT AT OTHER TIMES WHEN RETALIATORY APPLICATIONS WERE MADE TO HIM
I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO GO INTO RESIDENCE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SAID MARK RECURRING TO THE MORE AGREEABLE SUBJECT OF THE STALL
BUT THE MUFF LAY IN HER LAP PONDEROUS WITH ITS RICH ENCLOSURES I SUPPOSE YOU WILL LIVE IN BARCHESTER FOR A PORTION OF THE YEAR NOW SAID MISTER CRAWLEY I REALLY DO NOT KNOW AS YET MARK TALKS OF TAKING LODGINGS FOR HIS FIRST MONTH'S RESIDENCE
THE STRONG BENT OF NATURE IS SEEN IN THE PROPORTION WHICH THIS TOPIC OF PERSONAL RELATIONS USURPS IN THE CONVERSATION OF SOCIETY WHAT DO WE WISH TO KNOW OF ANY WORTHY PERSON SO MUCH AS HOW HE HAS SPED IN THE HISTORY OF THIS SENTIMENT
INSTEAD OF THIS OLD CHRONOLOGY OF SELFISHNESS AND PRIDE TO WHICH WE HAVE TOO LONG LENT OUR EYES
MERELY ECHOES TO HIM A SENTIMENT OF HIS INFANCY A PRAYER OF HIS YOUTH HE THEN PIERCES TO THE TRUTH THROUGH ALL THE CONFUSION OF TRADITION AND THE CARICATURE OF INSTITUTIONS RARE EXTRAVAGANT SPIRITS COME BY US AT INTERVALS
THAT WE CANNOT STRONGLY STATE ONE FACT WITHOUT SEEMING TO BELIE SOME OTHER
SHARPLY DEFINED AND SYMMETRICAL FEATURES WHOSE EYE SOCKETS ARE SO FORMED THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR SUCH EYES TO SQUINT AND TAKE FURTIVE GLANCES ON THIS SIDE AND ON THAT BUT THEY MUST TURN THE WHOLE HEAD THE MANNERS OF THAT PERIOD ARE PLAIN AND FIERCE
THE SHOES OF SWIFTNESS THE SWORD OF SHARPNESS THE POWER OF SUBDUING THE ELEMENTS OF USING THE SECRET VIRTUES OF MINERALS
A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL AFFIRMS THAT IT WAS DONE BY US AND NOT DONE BY US SURELY IT WAS BY MAN BUT WE FIND IT NOT IN OUR MAN BUT WE APPLY OURSELVES TO THE HISTORY OF ITS PRODUCTION
BUT IS OCCULT AND OUT OF THE REACH OF THE UNDERSTANDING NATURE IS AN ENDLESS COMBINATION AND REPETITION OF A VERY FEW LAWS SHE HUMS THE OLD WELL KNOWN AIR THROUGH INNUMERABLE VARIATIONS
THROUGH THE GRUB THROUGH THE EGG THE CONSTANT INDIVIDUAL THROUGH COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS THE FIXED SPECIES THROUGH MANY SPECIES THE GENUS THROUGH ALL GENERA THE STEADFAST TYPE
BY INFINITE DIAMETERS GENIUS WATCHES THE MONAD THROUGH ALL HIS MASKS AS HE PERFORMS THE METEMPSYCHOSIS OF NATURE GENIUS DETECTS THROUGH THE FLY THROUGH THE CATERPILLAR
AND LIVE APART FROM HIM AND INDEPENDENT OF HIM THE PROMETHEUS VINCTUS IS THE ROMANCE OF SKEPTICISM NOT LESS TRUE TO ALL TIME ARE THE DETAILS OF THAT STATELY APOLOGUE
STILL INDICATE THE GREEN WITHES THAT TIED THEM NO ONE CAN WALK IN A ROAD
ANY MORE THAN HE CAN DRAW TO DAY THE FACE OF A PERSON WHOM HE SHALL SEE TO MORROW FOR THE FIRST TIME I WILL NOT NOW GO BEHIND THE GENERAL STATEMENT TO EXPLORE THE REASON OF THIS CORRESPONDENCY LET IT SUFFICE THAT IN THE LIGHT OF THESE TWO FACTS NAMELY
THAT THEY HAVE NO FAIRER PAGE IN THEIR LIFE'S BOOK THAN THE DELICIOUS MEMORY OF SOME PASSAGES WHEREIN AFFECTION CONTRIVED TO GIVE A WITCHCRAFT SURPASSING THE DEEP ATTRACTION OF ITS OWN TRUTH TO A PARCEL OF ACCIDENTAL AND TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
AND WHEN IT SHALL BE A PRIVATE OPINION AGAIN IT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE AGE THE FACT NARRATED MUST CORRESPOND TO SOMETHING IN ME TO BE CREDIBLE OR INTELLIGIBLE
I FIND TRUE IN CONCORD
ALONG THE SIDES OF THE STONE WALL WHICH OBVIOUSLY GAVE THE IDEA OF THE COMMON ARCHITECTURAL SCROLL
THESE PROPENSITIES STILL FIGHT OUT THE OLD BATTLE IN THE NATION AND IN THE INDIVIDUAL THE NOMADS OF AFRICA WERE CONSTRAINED TO WANDER BY THE ATTACKS OF THE GAD FLY
OUR SO CALLED HISTORY IS HOW MANY TIMES WE MUST SAY ROME AND PARIS AND CONSTANTINOPLE WHAT DOES ROME KNOW OF RAT AND LIZARD WHAT ARE OLYMPIADS AND CONSULATES TO THESE NEIGHBORING SYSTEMS OF BEING NAY
IT IS THE DAWN OF CIVILITY AND GRACE IN THE COARSE AND RUSTIC THE RUDE VILLAGE BOY TEASES THE GIRLS ABOUT THE SCHOOL HOUSE DOOR BUT TO DAY HE COMES RUNNING INTO THE ENTRY AND MEETS ONE FAIR CHILD DISPOSING HER SATCHEL
SO THAT WHEN ART CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF NATURE IT COULD NOT MOVE ON A SMALL SCALE WITHOUT DEGRADING ITSELF WHAT WOULD STATUES OF THE USUAL SIZE OR NEAT PORCHES AND WINGS HAVE BEEN
WITH SOME CLOSENESS TO THE FAITH OF LATER AGES PROMETHEUS IS THE JESUS OF THE OLD MYTHOLOGY HE IS THE FRIEND OF MAN STANDS BETWEEN THE UNJUST JUSTICE OF THE ETERNAL FATHER AND THE RACE OF MORTALS
ALL EVENTS PROFITABLE ALL DAYS HOLY ALL MEN DIVINE FOR THE EYE IS FASTENED ON THE LIFE AND SLIGHTS THE CIRCUMSTANCE EVERY CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
AND READILY SUFFERS ALL THINGS ON THEIR ACCOUNT
SIR WILLIAM ASHTON IS A MASK FOR A VULGAR TEMPTATION
HE WALKS WITH ARMS AKIMBO HE SOLILOQUIZES HE ACCOSTS THE GRASS AND THE TREES HE FEELS THE BLOOD OF THE VIOLET THE CLOVER AND THE LILY IN HIS VEINS AND HE TALKS WITH THE BROOK THAT WETS HIS FOOT
COLUMBUS NEEDS A PLANET TO SHAPE HIS COURSE UPON
DO NOT THE CONSTRUCTIVE FINGERS OF WATT FULTON WHITTEMORE ARKWRIGHT
HE THAT IS ONCE ADMITTED TO THE RIGHT OF REASON IS MADE A FREEMAN OF THE WHOLE ESTATE WHAT PLATO HAS THOUGHT HE MAY THINK WHAT A SAINT HAS FELT HE MAY FEEL
WHICH BELONG TO ACTS OF SELF RELIANCE IT IS REMARKABLE THAT INVOLUNTARILY WE ALWAYS READ AS SUPERIOR BEINGS UNIVERSAL HISTORY THE POETS THE ROMANCERS
WHICH AT ONCE SHOWED TO ME THAT THE GREEKS DREW FROM NATURE WHEN THEY PAINTED THE THUNDERBOLT IN THE HAND OF JOVE
HE HOLDS HER BOOKS TO HELP HER AND INSTANTLY IT SEEMS TO HIM AS IF SHE REMOVED HERSELF FROM HIM INFINITELY AND WAS A SACRED PRECINCT AMONG THE THRONG OF GIRLS HE RUNS RUDELY ENOUGH BUT ONE ALONE DISTANCES HIM
BY SURROUNDING OURSELVES WITH THE ORIGINAL CIRCUMSTANCES WE INVENT ANEW THE ORDERS AND THE ORNAMENTS OF ARCHITECTURE
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT COMMON SOULS PAY WITH WHAT THEY DO NOBLER SOULS WITH THAT WHICH THEY ARE AND WHY BECAUSE A PROFOUND NATURE AWAKENS IN US BY ITS ACTIONS AND WORDS BY ITS VERY LOOKS AND MANNERS
AND WHAT FASTENS ATTENTION IN THE INTERCOURSE OF LIFE LIKE ANY PASSAGE BETRAYING AFFECTION BETWEEN TWO PARTIES PERHAPS WE NEVER SAW THEM BEFORE AND NEVER SHALL MEET THEM AGAIN BUT WE SEE THEM EXCHANGE A GLANCE OR BETRAY A DEEP EMOTION AND WE ARE NO LONGER STRANGERS
WHILST NOW WE PRAY WITH THE UTMOST COLDNESS AND VERY SELDOM
SOFT AND FLUID AS A CLOUD OR THE AIR WHY SHOULD WE BE SUCH HARD PEDANTS AND MAGNIFY A FEW FORMS WHY SHOULD WE MAKE ACCOUNT OF TIME OR OF MAGNITUDE OR OF FIGURE THE SOUL KNOWS THEM NOT
EVERY REVOLUTION WAS FIRST A THOUGHT IN ONE MAN'S MIND AND WHEN THE SAME THOUGHT OCCURS TO ANOTHER MAN IT IS THE KEY TO THAT ERA EVERY REFORM WAS ONCE A PRIVATE OPINION
SOME MEN CLASSIFY OBJECTS BY COLOR AND SIZE AND OTHER ACCIDENTS OF APPEARANCE OTHERS BY INTRINSIC LIKENESS OR BY THE RELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT
WE HAVE AS IT WERE BEEN THE MAN THAT MADE THE MINSTER WE HAVE SEEN HOW IT COULD AND MUST BE WE HAVE THE SUFFICIENT REASON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN IS IN THEIR PRINCIPLE OF ASSOCIATION
AH BROTHER STOP THE EBB OF THY SOUL EBBING DOWNWARD INTO THE FORMS INTO WHOSE HABITS THOU HAST NOW FOR MANY YEARS SLID AS NEAR AND PROPER TO US IS ALSO THAT OLD FABLE OF THE SPHINX WHO WAS SAID TO SIT IN THE ROAD SIDE
ELM OAK PINE FIR AND SPRUCE THE GOTHIC CATHEDRAL
IN MAN WE STILL TRACE THE REMAINS OR HINTS OF ALL THAT WE ESTEEM BADGES OF SERVITUDE IN THE LOWER RACES YET IN HIM THEY ENHANCE HIS NOBLENESS AND GRACE
THE GRECIAN STATE IS THE ERA OF THE BODILY NATURE
FROM ROME AND ATHENS AND LONDON TO HIMSELF AND NOT DENY HIS CONVICTION THAT HE IS THE COURT AND IF ENGLAND OR EGYPT HAVE ANY THING TO SAY TO HIM HE WILL TRY THE CASE
AND DO AS IT WERE RUN INTO ONE WHY SHOULD I MEASURE DEGREES OF LATITUDE WHY SHOULD I COUNT EGYPTIAN YEARS THE STUDENT INTERPRETS THE AGE OF CHIVALRY BY HIS OWN AGE OF CHIVALRY AND THE DAYS OF MARITIME ADVENTURE
MORE THAN ONCE SOME INDIVIDUAL HAS APPEARED TO ME WITH SUCH NEGLIGENCE OF LABOR AND SUCH COMMANDING CONTEMPLATION A HAUGHTY BENEFICIARY BEGGING IN THE NAME OF GOD AS MADE GOOD TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SIMEON THE STYLITE
TRANSPORT HIM TO LARGE COUNTRIES DENSE POPULATION
OR PERHAPS HIS FACILITY IS DEEPER SEATED IN THE INCREASED RANGE OF HIS FACULTIES OF OBSERVATION
NOMADISM AND AGRICULTURE ARE THE TWO ANTAGONIST FACTS THE GEOGRAPHY OF ASIA AND OF AFRICA
RICHARD ALSO WISHES FOR AN INTERVIEW IT IS ONLY NATURAL MISSUS HARE MUST BE THANKFUL TO HEAR SO FAR THAT HE IS SAFE I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT RETURNED BARBARA THE CHANGE IS AKIN TO MAGIC SHE SAYS IT HAS PUT LIFE INTO HER ANEW AND NOW FOR THE LAST THING
IN A WEEK'S TIME I CAME UPON HIM AGAIN IT WAS AT NIGHT HE WAS COMING OUT OF ONE OF THE THEATRES AND I WENT UP AND STOOD BEFORE HIM WHAT DO YOU WANT FELLOW HE ASKED I HAVE SEEN YOU WATCHING ME BEFORE THIS
INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHEN LADY ISABEL LAY DOWN TO REST SHE SANK INTO A SOMEWHAT CALMER SLEEP THAN SHE HAD KNOWN OF LATE ALSO INTO A DREAM SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BACK AT EAST LYNNE NOT BACK IN ONE SENSE
AND WILL BE AT THE GROVE TO NIGHT TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY I HAVE INVITED THE JUSTICES TO GET MISTER HARE SAFE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOUSE
SHE BROKE OFF WITH A LOOK OF DREAD IT WOULD BE IT MIGHT BE DEATH IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE CALMLY REPLIED MISTER CARLYLE THE DOORS ARE DOUBLE DOORS DID YOU NOTICE THAT THEY WERE NEVERTHELESS SHE LEFT HER CHAIR AND STOOD CLOSE TO MISTER CARLYLE
WHEN DISSENTING FROM A PROBLEM SHE WAS SURE THERE WAS SOME MYSTERY ASTIR SHE TURNED AND WALKED DOWN THE STREET WITH BARBARA
SET ON BY THAT WRETCH THORN MISTER CARLYLE TURNED TO THE SIDEBOARD AND POURED OUT A WINEGLASS OF BRANDY DRINK IT RICHARD IT WILL WARM YOU I'D RATHER HAVE IT IN SOME HOT WATER SIR
AND REMEMBER MEN ARE NOT GIVEN INTO CUSTODY FOR WATCHING OTHERS HE SIGNIFICANTLY ADDED I KNOW YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ANY REGARD FOR YOURSELF YOU'LL KEEP OUT OF MY WAY
WHEN SHE WAS IN ONE OF HER RESOLUTE MOODS WOULD BE OF NO USE MISTER CARLYLE OPENED THE DOOR DEXTEROUSLY SWUNG HIMSELF THROUGH IT AND SHUT IT AFTER HIM
AND THEY ARE BOTH IN THE SAME HANDWRITING YOUR SOLICITORS I BELIEVE UP WENT HIS HAND AT THE LAST WORD AND HE MADE A SORT OF GRAB AT THE LETTERS STALKED TO THE FARTHEST WINDOW OPENED IT AND GLANCED OVER ITS CONTENTS SIR
I HAVE COME UP HERE TO LIVE MISTER CARLYLE FELT CHECKMATED HE HAD ALWAYS BOWED TO THE WILL OF MISS CORNY BUT HE HAD AN IDEA THAT HE AND HIS WIFE SHOULD BE BETTER WITHOUT HER AND YOUR HOUSE HE EXCLAIMED
I WAS MAD WITH JEALOUSY FOR I THEN SAW THAT AFY HAD SENT ME AWAY THAT SHE MIGHT ENTERTAIN HIM I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS THORN NEVER CAME BUT AT DUSK OBSERVED MISTER CARLYLE I NEVER KNEW HIM TO DO SO UNTIL THAT EVENING ALL I CAN SAY IS HE WAS THERE THEN
IT WAS A FATAL STEP YES I WAS A FOOL I THOUGHT I'D WAIT QUIET AND SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ALL
EXCEPTING THAT IT WAS CONNECTED WITH THE OFFICE AND OLD MISTER DILL AND THAT MISTER CARLYLE LAUGHED WHEN HE TOLD IT THEY APPEARED TO BE INTERRUPTED BY THE CRYING OF ARCHIBALD AND IN TURNING TO THE LAWN TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER SHE AWOKE
OH WHAT A MISERABLE NIGHT'S WORK THAT WAS OUR ONLY COMFORT IS RICHARD THAT YOU MUST HAVE COMMITTED THE DEED IN MADNESS I DID NOT COMMIT IT AT ALL HE REPLIED WHAT SHE EXCLAIMED
CRIED THE RELIEVED LADY ISABEL I HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO IT BUT I MUST LEARN I DON'T THINK I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HOUSEKEEPING MISS CORNY'S ANSWER WAS TO STALK FROM THE ROOM ISABEL ROSE FROM HER CHAIR LIKE A BIRD RELEASED FROM ITS CAGE AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE
THAN I FOUND MYSELF OVERWHELMED WITH BUSINESS AND AWAY FROM IT I COULD NOT GET EVEN NOW I CAN ONLY REMAIN WITH YOU A COUPLE OF DAYS FOR I MUST HASTEN BACK TO TOWN YOU ARE BREAKING FAITH ALREADY SHE SAID AFTER HEARING HIM CALMLY TO THE END
AND CAME BACK WITH THE NOTED JUSTICES AT HIS HEELS THEY OBEYED THE SUMMONS WITH ALACRITY FOR THEY BELIEVED THEY HAD GOT THEMSELVES INTO A JUDICIAL SCRAPE AND THAT MISTER CARLYLE ALONE COULD GET THEM OUT OF IT I WILL NOT REQUEST YOU TO SIT DOWN BEGAN MISTER CARLYLE
TANNERS CURRIERS AND LEATHER DRESSERS POSSESSING A RELATIVE OF THE NAME DILL SAID HE SOMETHING HAS ARISEN WHICH IN MY MIND CASTS A DOUBT UPON RICHARD HARE'S GUILT I QUESTION WHETHER HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER
ON YOUR FAVORING US WITH INSTRUCTIONS AND WE REMAIN SIR MOST FAITHFULLY YOURS MOSS AND GRAB SIR FRANCIS LEVISON BART THE OUTSIDE OF THE LETTER WAS SUPERSCRIBED AS THE OTHER F LEVISON ESQUIRE
NO ONE SHALL COME IN IT IS ONLY PETER NOT PETER'S VOICE HOWEVER BUT JOYCE'S WAS HEARD IN RESPONSE TO MISTER CARLYLE'S DEMAND OF WHO WAS THERE
IT WAS OVER THEN AND ALL CLAIM TO THE NAME OF CARLYLE WAS DECLARED TO HAVE BEEN FORFEITED BY THE LADY ISABEL FOREVER CAPTAIN LEVISON FOLDED UP THE LETTER AND PLACED IT SECURELY IN AN INNER POCKET IS THERE ANY NEWS SHE ASKED
LADY ISABEL WAITED TILL THE MAN WAS GONE AND THEN SPOKE A FAINT FLUSH OF EMOTION IN HER CHEEKS YOU DO NOT MEAN WHAT YOU SAY YOU WILL NOT LEAVE ME YET I CANNOT DO OTHERWISE HE ANSWERED THERE'S A MOUNTAIN OF BUSINESS TO BE ATTENDED TO
AFY DECLARED HE WAS WITH HER REPEATED MISTER CARLYLE LOOK HERE SIR YOU ARE A SHARP MAN AND FOLKS SAY I AM NOT BUT I CAN SEE THINGS AND DRAW MY REASONING AS WELL AS THEY CAN PERHAPS
RICHARD UTTERED MISTER CARLYLE I AM THUNDERSTRUCK
MUST HAVE MET THORN QUITTING IT DID YOU ENCOUNTER THAT HOUND I ASKED HIM WHAT HOUND RETURNED BETHEL THAT FINE FELLOW THAT THORN WHO COMES AFTER AFY I ANSWERED FOR I DID NOT MIND MENTIONING HER NAME IN MY PASSION
YOU WILL SPEEDILY GATHER HIS MOTIVE PIERRE DEPARTED TOWARD CAPTAIN LEVISON'S ROOM AND LADY ISABEL TOOK UP THE LETTERS AND EXAMINED THEIR SUPERSCRIPTION WITH INTEREST IT WAS KNOWN TO HER THAT MISTER CARLYLE HAD NOT LOST A MOMENT
OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO POINT OUT THE DISCREPANCY AND TO INQUIRE HOW SHE COULD RECONCILE IT YET HER ASSERTION TO HIM HAD BEEN MOST POSITIVE AND SOLEMN THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE MATTER WHICH HE COULD NOT RECONCILE
AND THE CALMER HE SPOKE THE MORE CUTTING WERE HIS WORDS HE NEED NOT HAVE TOLD HER THIS WHAT WAS THE SECRET SHE INQUIRED IN A LOW TONE NAY I CAN'T EXPLAIN ALL THEY DID NOT TAKE ME INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE THEY DID NOT EVEN TAKE YOU
WHICH WAS AT THE FAR END OF THE GREAT BARN OF A ROOM AND TAKING THE WRITING CASE FROM IT GAVE IT TO HER SHE REACHED HER KEYS FROM THE STAND AT HER ELBOW UNLOCKED THE CASE AND TOOK FROM IT SOME BANK NOTES
THESE APARTMENTS ARE MINE NOW THEY HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED INTO MY NAME AND THEY CAN NEVER AGAIN AFFORD YOU ACCOMMODATION WILL YOU BE SO OBLIGING I AM NOT STRONG AS TO HAND ME THAT WRITING CASE SIR FRANCIS WALKED TO THE TABLE SHE INDICATED
WHAT FANCIES YOU DO TAKE UP UTTERED FRANCIS LEVISON SOME TIME SUBSEQUENT TO YOUR DEPARTURE SHE QUIETLY WENT ON ONE OF THE MAIDS WAS SETTING TO RIGHTS THE CLOTHES IN YOUR DRESSING CLOSET AND SHE BROUGHT ME A LETTER SHE FOUND IN ONE OF THE POCKETS
I WILL KEEP MY THOUGHT ON THE MATTER AND SHOULD ANYTHING ARISE WHAT SORT OF A MAN WAS THIS THORN
AND THE SNOW HAD SO SETTLED UPON HIM THAT LUCY WHO HAPPENED TO SEE HIM AS HE ENTERED THE HALL SCREAMED OUT LAUGHINGLY
A COURTESY PROBABLY NOT YET SHOWN TO ANY CLIENT BY MISTER CARLYLE THE HOUSE DOOR CLOSED UPON HER AND BARBARA HAD TAKEN ONE STEP FROM IT WHEN SOMETHING LARGE LOOMED DOWN UPON HER LIKE A SHIP IN FULL SAIL
THEY LOOK AS STRONG AS EYES CAN LOOK BUT WHY WEAR COLORED GLASSES WHITE ONES WOULD ANSWER EVERY PURPOSE I SHOULD SUPPOSE
WHAT REASON I MUST REQUEST YOU TO TELL ME I OVERHEARD SCRAPS OF THEIR CONVERSATION NOW AND THEN IN THOSE MEETINGS AND SO GATHERED MY INFORMATION YOU TOLD A DIFFERENT TALE TO ME SIR FRANCIS WAS HER REMARK
IT WAS THORN MURDERED HALLIJOHN AND I HAD NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH IT BARBARA BROKE OUT OF THE TREES AND FLEW ALONG BUT MISTER HARE WAS ALREADY IN LOCKING AND BARRING THE DOOR LET ME IN PAPA SHE CALLED OUT
AND SHE SAYS SHE FEELS AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT HE WAS IN SOME WAY OR OTHER MIXED UP IN IT BARBARA HE WAS NO MORE MIXED UP IN IT THAN YOU AND YOU SAY THAT YOU WERE NOT
ISABEL'S HEART SANK WITHIN HER AT THE IDEA OF THAT STERN MISS CORNY MOUNTED OVER HER AS RESIDENT GUARD BUT REFINED AND SENSITIVE ALMOST PAINFULLY CONSIDERATE OF THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS SHE RAISED NO WORD OF OBJECTION
I BOLTED UNDER THE HORSES OF A PASSING VEHICLE DOWN SOME TURNINGS AND PASSAGES OUT INTO ANOTHER STREET AND UP BESIDE A CABMAN WHO WAS ON HIS BOX DRIVING A FARE PAST I REACHED MY LODGINGS IN SAFETY AS I THOUGHT
BETHEL LIGHTLY RETURNED RICHARD HARE HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT HE WAS AFTER HIS GINS AND HIS SNARES THAT NIGHT THOUGH POACHER AS HE IS BETHEL IS NO POACHER RICHARD IS HE NOT
IT WAS THE PRESENCE OF THAT GRIM MISS CORNY WHICH PUT HER OUT ALONE WITH HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD HAVE SAID WHAT OUGHT I TO ORDER ARCHIBALD TELL ME PETER WAITED A SOMETHING TO ROAST AND BOIL IF YOU PLEASE STAMMERED LADY ISABEL
BRAINS HE CERTAINLY HAD BUT THEY WERE NOT SHARP ONES IS MY MOTHER COMING OUT TO ME ASKED RICHARD AFTER A FEW INTERCHANGED SENTENCES WITH MISTER CARLYLE NO YOU ARE TO GO INDOORS
AND IT WAS I WHO THREW THE SPELL UPON PRYDERI TO AVENGE GWAWL FOR THE TRICK THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED ON HIM IN THE GAME OF BADGER IN THE BAG AND NOT ONLY WAS I WROTH BUT MY PEOPLE LIKEWISE
VERY SOON SHE LED HER VISITOR INTO THE GREAT HALL WHERE WINE AND FRUIT WERE ALWAYS WAITING AND ON THE TABLE LAY THE MAGIC KNIFE LEFT THERE BY HOUARN
FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS LITTLE WAS SEEN OF THE PRINCE WHO SPENT ALL HIS DAYS IN HUNTING AND TRYING TO FORGET THE OLD WIFE AT HOME AS FOR THE PRINCESS NO ONE TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT HER AND SHE PASSED THE DAYS ALONE IN HER APARTMENTS
AT THE FIRST NOTE OF MUSIC THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN THE FARMER ARRIVED IN THE MORNING TO SEE HIS GRANDSON HE FOUND THEM ALL WEEPING FOR WHILE THEY HAD SLEPT THE BABY HAD VANISHED WELL THE NEXT YEAR IT ALL HAPPENED AGAIN
THE PINK AND WHITE OF HER FACE REMINDED YOU OF THE SHELLS OF HER PALACE WHILE HER LONG BLACK HAIR WAS INTERTWINED WITH STRINGS OF CORAL AND HER DRESS OF GREEN SILK SEEMED FORMED OUT OF THE SEA AT THE SIGHT OF HER HOUARN STOPPED DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY
CRIED TEPHANY AND ENTERING THE HOUSE SHE SLAMMED THE DOOR BEHIND HER LONELY AND MISERABLE SHE SAT DOWN BY THE FIRE AND STARED INTO THE RED EMBERS
BUT GO ON WITH YOUR STORY ONE DAY SHORTLY AFTER THE DEATH OF THE QUEEN CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN YOUR HIGHNESS WAS HUNTING AND OUTSTRIPPED ALL YOUR ATTENDANTS WHILE CHASING THE DEER YOU WERE IN A PART OF THE COUNTRY WHICH YOU DID NOT KNOW
AND HUTS FOR THE PEOPLE TO DWELL IN AND HE WAS SATISFIED IN HIS SOUL
AND MANY WERE THE JOKES SHE MADE ABOUT THEM OF COURSE THEY HEARD OF HER JESTS AND SHOOK THEIR HEADS SAYING SHE IS AN ILL NATURED LITTLE CAT
THAN KNOW THAT HE WOULD SUFFER SUCH AN INJURY WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO AVENGE IT AS FOR THE GENTLEMAN WHO STRUCK HIM HE WILL BE BROUGHT BEFORE MY JUDGES AND WILL PLEAD HIS OWN CAUSE BUT I HARDLY THINK HE CAN ESCAPE DEATH AFTER HAVING ASSAULTED THE HEIR TO THE CROWN
WHAT WOULD TWO DO WITH ONE RAM THERE WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE MORE THAN ONE BUT YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME ALL THE SAME JONAS SAID WALTER YOU SEE I CAN VERY WELL MANAGE ONE
BUT I AM NOT QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO WOLVES YET AND HE MIGHT TEAR HOLES IN MY NEW TROUSERS WELL JUST LISTEN SAID JONAS
YOU ARE SURE YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
NO IT IS NOT YOU ANSWERED SHE SO HE WENT AWAY AND SLEPT IN THE WOOD WHEN THE THIRD MAN ARRIVED HIS WIFE GAVE HIM HIS SUPPER AND AFTER THAT HE WENT TO BED JUST AS USUAL THE NEXT MORNING
SO SEEING AN ORCHARD ALL PINK AND WHITE WITH APPLE BLOSSOMS AND A GIRL TOSSING A BALL IN ONE CORNER
STAND ON HIS HEAD RIDE SEE SAW THROW SNOWBALLS PLAY BALL CROW LIKE A COCK EAT BREAD AND BUTTER AND DRINK SOUR MILK TEAR HIS TROUSERS
THEY NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD AUGHT CONCERNING DOGS OR BOAR I WILL GO INTO THE CASTLE AND GET TIDINGS OF THE DOGS SAID PRYDERI AT LAST TRULY ANSWERED MANAWYDDAN THOU WOULDST DO UNWISELY FOR WHOSOEVER HAS CAST A SPELL OVER THIS LAND HAS SET THIS CASTLE HERE
IT WAS AT THIS VERY MOMENT THAT BELLAH WHO WAS SKIMMING THE MILK IN THE FARM DAIRY HEARD THE FAIRY BELL TINKLE VIOLENTLY AT THE SOUND SHE GREW PALE FOR SHE KNEW IT MEANT THAT HOUARN WAS IN DANGER
AND THE HOODIE'S WIFE WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT HER HUSBAND RESOLVED TO TAKE HER AWAY TO ANOTHER HOUSE HE HAD AND HER SISTERS WITH HER FOR COMPANY SO THEY SET OUT IN A COACH WHICH WAS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD THEM AND HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR WHEN THE HOODIE SUDDENLY SAID
AND AS HE DID SO THE BISHOP STRUCK HER WITH HIS STAFF AND SHE TURNED INTO A YOUNG WOMAN THE FAIREST THAT EVER WAS SEEN LOOK AROUND UPON THY LAND SAID HE AND THOU WILT SEE IT ALL TILLED AND PEOPLED AS IT WAS LONG AGO
THEN SHE LOOKED ROUND FOR SOME PLACE TO REST IN AND SHE BEHELD A LITTLE HOUSE OF LIGHT BEFORE HER AND FAST SHE HURRIED TOWARDS IT AT THE DOOR STOOD A LITTLE BOY AND HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH PLEASURE AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
WHY YOU MUST BE A HUNDRED AT LEAST OH NO IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE HE SPOKE WITHOUT THINKING BUT THE FLASH OF ANGER WHICH DARTED FROM HER EYES MADE HIM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE HOWEVER ALL SHE SAID WAS AS YOU LIKE SINCE YOU REJECT ME LET THE CROWS HAVE YOU
THE GIRL AWOKE WITH A START AND LEANT FORWARD TO GRASP HIM BUT HE WAS ALREADY FLYING OFF AND SHE ONLY SEIZED A FEATHER FROM HIS WING AND WHEN DAWN CAME SHE GOT UP AND TOLD THE WOMAN HE HAS GONE OVER THE HILL OF POISON SAID SHE
BUT THOUGH HOUARN HELD HIS PEACE HE WAS NOT AS HAPPY AS BEFORE SOMETHING SEEMED TO HAVE GONE WRONG AND THEN HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED BELLAH IS IT POSSIBLE I CAN HAVE FORGOTTEN HER SO SOON
SHE DID HER BEST TO PERSUADE HIM TO REMAIN WITH HER BUT HE WOULD NOT LISTEN AND AT LAST SHE GREW ANGRY
AND SOMETIMES SHE SAW HIM ON THE TOP BUT WHEN SHE GOT TO THE TOP HE HAD FLOWN INTO THE VALLEY AND WHEN SHE REACHED THE VALLEY HE WAS ON THE TOP OF ANOTHER HILL AND SO IT HAPPENED TILL NIGHT CAME ROUND AGAIN
TREMBLING THEY SAT TILL THE DARKNESS FLED AND THE LIGHT SHONE AGAIN UPON THEM BUT IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE WONT TO SEE CATTLE AND HERDS AND DWELLINGS THEY BEHELD NEITHER HOUSE NOR BEAST NOR MAN NOR SMOKE
LIKE THEM I SHALL SEEK TILL I GET WHAT I WANT THAT IS MONEY TO BUY A COW AND A PIG TO FATTEN AND IF YOU LOVE ME BELLAH YOU WON'T ATTEMPT TO HINDER A PLAN WHICH WILL HASTEN OUR MARRIAGE THE GIRL SAW IT WAS USELESS TO SAY MORE SO SHE ANSWERED SADLY
I MIGHT NOT HAVE TIME TO KILL THEM ALL BEFORE THEY RAN AWAY IN WALTER'S PLACE
BUT NOWHERE COULD THEY FIND IT AND THE FARMER WHO HAD COME TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER WAS GREATLY GRIEVED AS HE FEARED IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD STOLEN IT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT THE HOODIE FOR A SON IN LAW
AND PROSPERED SO GREATLY THAT AS LONG AS ONE COULD BE BOUGHT FROM HIM NOT A SHOE WAS PURCHASED FROM THE SHOEMAKERS OF THE TOWN AND THE CRAFTSMEN WERE WROTH AND BANDED TOGETHER TO SLAY THEM PRYDERI SAID MANAWYDDAN WHEN HE HAD RECEIVED NEWS OF IT
SO ONE DAY THE BROWNIE ASKED JEGU IF HE MIGHT BRING HIS FRIENDS TO HAVE SUPPER IN THE GREAT BARN AND WHETHER HE WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DANCE THERE OF COURSE JEGU WAS ONLY TOO PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE BROWNIE AND HE ORDERED BARBAIK TO SPREAD HER BEST TABLE CLOTHS IN THE BARN
AND AS SHE GLANCED AT TEPHANY SHE GAVE A LITTLE MISCHIEVOUS LAUGH AND SAID WHY MY PRETTY MAIDEN HARDLY LOOKS
AND IN THE DWELLINGS THAT WERE LEFT WAS NOTHING SAVE WILD BEASTS FOR A YEAR THESE FOUR FED ON THE MEAT THAT MANAWYDDAN AND PRYDERI KILLED OUT HUNTING AND THE HONEY OF THE BEES THAT SUCKED THE MOUNTAIN HEATHER FOR A TIME THEY DESIRED NOTHING MORE
THEN AT LAST TEPHANY BEGAN TO NOTICE SOMETHING AND THE SOMETHING MADE HER VERY SAD AT FIRST DENIS SEEMED TO FIND THE HOURS THAT THEY WERE TOGETHER FLY AS QUICKLY AS SHE DID BUT WHEN HE HAD TAUGHT HER ALL THE SONGS HE KNEW
BECAUSE FOR SEVEN YEARS NO MAN HATH VISITED THIS PLACE I WANDER WHERE I WILL ANSWERED THE SCHOLAR AND WHAT WORK ART THOU UPON I AM ABOUT TO HANG A THIEF THAT I CAUGHT ROBBING ME
LORD SAID THE PRIEST SOONER THAN SEE THEE TOUCH THIS REPTILE I WOULD PURCHASE ITS FREEDOM I WILL NEITHER SELL IT NOR SET IT FREE IT IS TRUE THAT A MOUSE IS WORTH NOTHING
THE WOMEN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER THE MEN OF THE TOWN ARE SO SILLY THAT WE CAN MAKE THEM BELIEVE ANYTHING WE PLEASE SAID THEY WELL
AND THEY WOULD NOT BE PARTED FROM EACH OTHER BY NIGHT OR BY DAY SO GREAT WAS THE LOVE BETWEEN THEM ONE DAY WHEN THEY WERE RETURNED THEY WERE SITTING OUT IN A GREEN PLACE AND SUDDENLY THE CRASH OF THUNDER STRUCK LOUDLY ON THEIR EARS AND A WALL OF MIST FELL BETWEEN THEM
IT IS BETTER FOR ME TO BEAT THE DRUM A LITTLE BEFORE I GO THERE THOUGHT WALTER BR R R SO HE BEGAN TO BEAT HIS DRUM
THE GIRL WAS SURPRISED AT HIS WORDS FOR SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT HE COULD BE ANYTHING BUT A HOODIE AT ALL TIMES STILL SHE SAID NOTHING OF THIS AND ONLY REPLIED I WOULD RATHER THOU WERT A MAN BY DAY AND A HOODIE BY NIGHT AND SO HE WAS
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHY IN COUNTING CABBAGES EVERYTHING HAD GONE WRONG AND SHE COULD NOT GET A LABOURER TO STAY WITH HER BECAUSE OF HER BAD TEMPER WHEN THEREFORE SHE SAW HER NIECE STANDING QUIETLY BEFORE HER MIRROR BARBAIK BROKE OUT
WHEN A VOICE CAME OUT OF THE GORSE CLOSE BY
THE GIRL WAS WILLING AND THE FATHER WAS WILLING AND VERY SOON THEY WERE MARRIED AND WENT TO LIVE AT THE FARM BY AND BYE THE SEASON CAME WHEN THEY MUST CUT THE PEATS AND PILE THEM UP TO DRY SO THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE FIRES IN THE WINTER
AND WHAT WAS WORSE OFTEN MADE FUN OF HIM WITH THE REST
AND AFTER RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO A WEDDING SHE BEGGED THE BROWNIE TO GET HER A HORSE TO RIDE THERE TO HER GREAT JOY HE CONSENTED BIDDING HER SET OUT FOR THE CITY OF THE DWARFS AND TO TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED
CARO LIVES IN THE DOG HOUSE BRAVO IN THE STABLE PUTTE WITH THE STABLEMAN
THE GIRL WAS VERY UNHAPPY AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS AND FELT SORRY THAT SHE HAD NOT TRIED TO MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS SHE IMPLORED HOUARN NOT TO LEAVE HER BUT HE WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING THE BIRDS HE SAID CONTINUE FLYING UNTIL THEY REACH A FIELD OF CORN AND
HE GAINED WONDERFUL VICTORIES FOR JUSTINIAN AND CONQUERED SOME OF THE OLD ROMAN PROVINCES THAT HAD BEEN LOST FOR MANY YEARS THE VICTORIES OF THESE TWO GENERALS LARGELY HELPED TO MAKE THE REIGN OF JUSTINIAN REMARKABLE IN HISTORY
AND HE SOON BECAME A SKILLFUL CAMEL DRIVER MOHAMMED WAS VERY FAITHFUL AND HONEST IN ALL HIS WORK HE ALWAYS SPOKE THE TRUTH AND NEVER BROKE A PROMISE I HAVE GIVEN MY PROMISE HE WOULD SAY AND I MUST KEEP IT
DURING THOSE YEARS I WILL PAY TO THE KING YEARLY FIVE THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD I ACCEPT THE TERMS IN THE KING'S NAME RESPONDED THE CHIEF THE PRINCE WAS THEREFORE GIVEN UP AND THE MAGYARS WITHDREW DURING THE NINE YEARS OF TRUCE KING HENRY PAID GREAT ATTENTION TO THE ORGANIZATION OF AN ARMY
WHEN HIS FATHER WAS KILLED AND NOW HE LED THEM ON TO FIGHT THEY WERE ALL EAGER TO HAVE REVENGE FOR THE DEATH OF THEIR KING SO THEY FOUGHT LIKE LIONS AND SWEPT ACROSS THE PLAIN WITH GREAT FURY THE HUNS WERE SOON BEATEN ON EVERY SIDE
SO HE FILLED TWO CHESTS WITH SAND AND SENT WORD TO TWO WEALTHY MONEY LENDERS THAT HE WISHED TO BORROW SIX HUNDRED SPANISH MARKS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WOULD PUT INTO THEIR HANDS HIS TREASURES OF SILVER AND GOLD WHICH WERE PACKED IN TWO CHESTS
EDWARD FLED WITHOUT WAITING FOR A BATTLE AND ESCAPED TO THE NETHERLANDS IN A SAILING VESSEL THE KINGMAKER HAD NOW NO ONE TO RESIST HIM THE GATES OF LONDON WERE OPENED TO HIM AND THE CITIZENS HEARTILY WELCOMED HIM MARCHING TO THE TOWER
AND COMPLETELY DEFEATED HIM WARWICK WAS KILLED
VITIGES RETIRED TO RAVENNA AND BELISARIUS QUICKLY FOLLOWED AND MADE SUCH AN ASSAULT ON THE CITY THAT IT WAS COMPELLED TO SURRENDER THE OSTROGOTH ARMY WAS CAPTURED
THE EARL OF WARWICK KNOWN AS THE KINGMAKER
PEOPLE CAME FROM DISTANT PARTS OF ARABIA AND FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO HEAR HIM ONE DAY SIX OF THE CHIEF MEN OF ME DI'NA
AS HE WENT ALONG BEFORE SAILING WITH HIS ARMY FOR CARTHAGE HE WISHED VERY MUCH TO SEE WITH HIS OWN EYES WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE THE VANDALS WERE AND WHETHER THEY WERE SO POWERFUL AT HOME AS WAS GENERALLY BELIEVED
HE WAS VERY OLD WITH WRINKLED FACE AND LONG GRAY HAIR AND BEARD MANY PERSONS BELIEVED THAT HE WAS A FORTUNE TELLER SO PEOPLE OFTEN WENT TO HIM TO INQUIRE WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN TO THEM
RICHLY DRESSED HE WAS WELL LIKED AT THE EMPEROR'S COURT AND WAS RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LEARNING TWO ONE DAY A GREAT CHANGE CAME FOR BOTH UNCLE AND NEPHEW THE EMPEROR DIED
HIS ARMY GREW LARGER AND LARGER EVERY DAY PEOPLE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED WITH EDWARD AND HAD REJOICED TO GET RID OF HIM AND HAVE HENRY FOR KING BECAUSE IF HENRY WAS NOT CLEVER HE WAS GOOD BUT IN A SHORT TIME THEY HAD FOUND OUT THAT ENGLAND NEEDED A KING WHO WAS NOT ONLY GOOD
AND LIVED IN GREAT MAGNIFICENCE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DID WAS TO REPAY THE TWO FRIENDS WHO HAD LENT HIM THE SIX HUNDRED MARKS HE WAS KIND AND JUST TO THE SARACENS WHO HAD BECOME HIS SUBJECTS THEY WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE THEIR MOSQUES AND TO WORSHIP GOD AS THEY THOUGHT RIGHT IN TIME
AND THE DUKE OF YORK OR SOME OTHER NOBLEMAN HAD TO GOVERN THE KINGDOM FOR HIM THE EARL OF WARWICK ADDED YOU ARE THE RIGHTFUL HEIR TO THE THRONE
HERE I WILL PERISH IN THE FLAMES HE CRIED RATHER THAN SURRENDER TO MY ENEMIES
WERE ALL SO DEAR THAT NONE BUT THE RICH COULD BUY THEM PEOPLE ATE HORSES DOGS CATS AND MICE UNTIL IN THE WHOLE CITY ONLY THREE HORSES AND A MULE WERE LEFT ALIVE THEN ON THE FIFTEENTH OF JUNE TEN NINETY FOUR THE GOVERNOR WENT TO THE CAMP OF THE CID
THE BROTHER OF EMPEROR LEO'S WIFE BASILICUS SAILED WITH HIS SHIPS TO AFRICA AND LANDED THE ARMY NOT FAR FROM CARTHAGE GENSERIC ASKED FOR A TRUCE FOR FIVE DAYS TO CONSIDER TERMS OF PEACE AND THE TRUCE WAS GRANTED
THE MURDERERS SMOTHERED THEM WITH PILLOWS AND BURIED THEIR BODIES AT THE FOOT OF A STAIRWAY IN THE TOWER AND THERE AFTER MANY YEARS THEIR BONES WERE FOUND AFTER RICHARD HAD MURDERED HIS TWO NEPHEWS HE WAS CROWNED KING AS RICHARD THE THIRD
BEFORE THIS THE GERMAN SOLDIERS HAD FOUGHT CHIEFLY ON FOOT NOT AS THE MAGYARS DID ON HORSEBACK FOR THIS REASON THEY WERE AT A GREAT DISADVANTAGE IN BATTLE THE KING NOW RAISED A STRONG FORCE OF HORSEMEN AND HAD THEM DRILLED SO THOROUGHLY THAT THEY BECAME ALMOST INVINCIBLE
IN ANOTHER BATTLE BOTH MARGARET AND HER SON WERE MADE PRISONERS THE SON WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED IN THE PRESENCE OF KING EDWARD MARGARET WAS PLACED IN THE TOWER AND KING HENRY WHO DIED SOON AFTER THE BATTLE OF TEWKSBURY
WORSHIPED IDOLS VERY FEW OF THEM WERE CHRISTIANS
I WILL BECOME A CHRISTIAN AND SO WILL ALL MY MEN IF YOU WILL GRANT LIBERTY TO THEM AS TO ME AND HENCEFORTH WE WILL BE YOUR FRIENDS ALFRED THEN RELEASED THE DANES AND THEY WERE BAPTIZED AS CHRISTIANS AN OLD ROAD RUNNING ACROSS ENGLAND FROM LONDON TO CHESTER
THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE A SPLENDID CHURCH WAS BUILT FOR HIM IN MEDINA IT WAS CALLED A MOSQUE AND ALL MOHAMMEDAN CHURCHES OR PLACES OF WORSHIP
O KING I SEE YOU A FAMOUS CONQUEROR THE MASTER OF MANY NATIONS I SEE YOU GOING FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY DEFEATING ARMIES AND DESTROYING CITIES UNTIL MEN CALL YOU THE FEAR OF THE WORLD YOU HEAP UP VAST RICHES
AND DELIVERED TO HIM THE KEYS OF THE CITY THE CID PLACED HIS MEN IN ALL THE FORTS AND TOOK THE CITADEL AS HIS OWN DWELLING HIS BANNER FLOATED FROM THE TOWERS
HE BROUGHT OUT THE OLD KING AND PLACED HIM ONCE MORE UPON THE THRONE BUT THOUGH EDWARD HAD FLED HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED HE FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF THE KINGMAKER AND ASKED AID FROM FOREIGN FRIENDS THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY SUPPLIED HIM WITH MONEY AND SOLDIERS AND HE WAS SOON BACK IN ENGLAND
BUT SINCE THEN ROME HAD BECOME AGAIN GRAND AND WEALTHY SO THERE WAS PLENTY FOR GENSERIC AND HIS VANDALS TO CARRY AWAY THEY SPENT FOURTEEN DAYS IN THE WORK OF PLUNDER THEY SACKED THE TEMPLES
AS THEY SAT TALKING BEFORE A HUGE LOG FIRE IN THE GREAT ROOM OF THE CASTLE ENGLAND WILL NOT LONG ENDURE THE MISRULE OF A KING WHO IS HALF THE TIME OUT OF HIS MIND THE EARL SPOKE THE TRUTH
ORDERED THE MINSTREL TO BE BROUGHT TO HIS TENT ALFRED WENT SING TO ME SOME OF YOUR CHARMING SONGS SAID GUTHRUM I NEVER HEARD MORE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC SO THE KINGLY HARPER PLAYED AND SANG FOR THE DANE AND WENT AWAY WITH HANDSOME PRESENTS
THE GERMAN NOBLES WERE NOT WILLING FOR ANY FOREIGN PRINCE TO GOVERN THEM AND YET THEY SAW THAT THEY MUST UNITE TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY AGAINST THE INVASIONS OF THE BARBARIANS
LAUGHED AT WHAT HE TOLD THEM BUT SOME POOR PEOPLE AND A FEW SLAVES BELIEVED HIM AND ADOPTED THE NEW RELIGION OTHERS SAID HE WAS A DREAMER AND A FOOL MOHAMMED HOWEVER PAID NO HEED TO THE INSULTS HE RECEIVED
FOR THE ROMANS HAD NOT ONLY MADE GOOD ROADS AND BUILT STRONG WALLS AND FORTS IN BRITAIN BUT THEY HAD ALSO BROUGHT THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION INTO THE ISLAND AND AT ABOUT THE TIME OF THE SAXON INVASION SAINT PATRICK WAS FOUNDING CHURCHES AND MONASTERIES IN IRELAND
AND SOON THE ANGLES AND SAXONS ALSO LEFT THE NORTH SEA SHORES AND INVADED THE BEAUTIFUL ISLAND THE NEW INVADERS MET WITH BRAVE RESISTANCE THE BRITONS WERE HEADED BY KING ARTHUR ABOUT WHOM MANY MARVELOUS STORIES ARE TOLD
AND TO CROSS RIVERS AND HIGH HILLS BUT AT LAST ONE AFTERNOON IN MIDSUMMER HE WALKED THROUGH THE MAIN GATE OF CONSTANTINOPLE PROUD AND HAPPY THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED HIS PURPOSE HE HAD NO TROUBLE IN FINDING HIS UNCLE JUSTIN
AND WAS BAPTIZING WHOLE CLANS OF THE IRISH AT A TIME IT IS SAID THAT HE BAPTIZED TWELVE THOUSAND PERSONS WITH HIS OWN HAND MISSIONARIES WERE SENT OUT BY THE IRISH CHURCH TO CONVERT THE WILD PICTS OF SCOTLAND AND AT A LATER DAY THE DISTANT BARBARIANS OF GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND
WHEN ALFRED WAS TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD THE DANES INVADED VARIOUS PARTS OF ENGLAND SOME GREAT BATTLES WERE FOUGHT AND ALFRED'S ELDER BROTHER ETHELRED KING OF THE WEST SAXONS WAS KILLED
IN THOSE TIMES ALL TOWNS OF ANY GREAT SIZE WERE SURROUNDED BY STRONG WALLS THERE WAS WAR CONSTANTLY GOING ON
LAID SIEGE TO THE CITY THINKING THAT HE WOULD COMPEL THE ROMANS TO SURRENDER BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING ANY THOUGHT OF SURRENDER BELISARIUS WAS PREPARING HIS MEN FOR FIGHT AND WHEN THEY WERE READY HE ATTACKED VITIGES AND DEFEATED HIM
AND AT DAYLIGHT THE KNIGHTS OF THE CID MADE A SUDDEN ATTACK THE KING AWOKE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WERE COMING AGAINST HIM FULL SEVENTY THOUSAND KNIGHTS ALL DRESSED IN ROBES AS WHITE AS SNOW AND BEFORE THEM RODE A KNIGHT TALLER THAN ALL THE REST HOLDING IN HIS LEFT HAND A SNOW WHITE BANNER
THE INFANTRY ALSO WERE CAREFULLY DRILLED BESIDES THIS HENRY BUILT A NUMBER OF FORTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF HIS KINGDOM AND HAD ALL THE FORTIFIED CITIES MADE STRONGER THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE MAGYAR CHIEF APPEARED AT THE GERMAN COURT AND DEMANDED A TENTH PAYMENT
AND HELPED THEM TO ESCAPE FROM ENGLAND IN A SAILING VESSEL THREE
AND THE PROPER NAME FOR THEIR RELIGION IS ISLAM WHICH MEANS OBEDIENCE OR SUBMISSION
HE WAS SO ENRAGED AT THIS THAT HE AGAIN BEGAN WAR
BUT TROUBLE WAS NEAR WARWICK WISHED HIM TO FOLLOW HIS ADVICE EDWARD THOUGHT HE COULD MANAGE WITHOUT ANY ADVICE THEN THE KING AND THE KINGMAKER QUARRELED AND AT LAST BECAME OPEN ENEMIES AND FOUGHT ONE ANOTHER ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE THE END OF IT WAS THAT WARWICK WAS DEFEATED
AND MARCHED INTO OTHER PARTS OF THE COAST AND CAPTURED TOWNS AND CITIES BY THIS TIME BONIFACE HAD LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE WICKED PLOT OF AETIUS HE NOW REGRETTED HAVING INVITED THE VANDALS TO AFRICA AND TRIED TO INDUCE THEM TO RETURN TO SPAIN
VERY SOON HOWEVER HE WAS AGAIN ON THE WAR PATH THIS TIME HE INVADED ITALY
WHICH I KNEW THAT WE HAD REPEATED FOURTEEN TIMES EACH DESCENT OCCUPYING HALF AN HOUR THE CONCLUSION WAS EASY THAT WE HAD BEEN SEVEN HOURS PLUS FOURTEEN QUARTERS OF REST MAKING TEN HOURS AND A HALF WE HAD STARTED AT ONE IT MUST THEREFORE NOW BE ELEVEN O'CLOCK
AND JUDGING BY THESE RIDGES OF FOAM YOU MAY OBSERVE THAT THE SEA WILL RISE ABOUT TWELVE FEET THIS IS WONDERFUL I SAID NO IT IS QUITE NATURAL YOU MAY SAY SO UNCLE BUT TO ME IT IS MOST EXTRAORDINARY
HIS EYES AVOIDED MINE WE MUST RETURN I EXCLAIMED VEHEMENTLY WE MUST GO BACK ON OUR WAY TO SNAEFELL MAY GOD GIVE US STRENGTH TO CLIMB UP THE CRATER AGAIN RETURN SAID MY UNCLE
STILL I HAD COURAGEOUSLY SHOULDERED MY BURDEN AGAIN AND WAS RAPIDLY FOLLOWING HANS WHOM MY UNCLE PRECEDED I WAS ANXIOUS NOT TO BE LEFT BEHIND MY GREATEST CARE WAS NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF MY COMPANIONS
HASTIGT HASTIGT CRIED OUR GUIDE WITHOUT KNOWING DANISH I UNDERSTOOD AT ONCE THAT WE MUST FOLLOW HANS AT THE TOP OF OUR SPEED HE BEGAN TO CIRCLE ROUND THE CONE OF THE CRATER BUT IN A DIAGONAL DIRECTION SO AS TO FACILITATE OUR PROGRESS
WHAT ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WAS THE CAUSE OF THEM I COULD NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION AT THE MOMENT HUNGER AND FATIGUE MADE ME INCAPABLE OF REASONING A DESCENT OF SEVEN HOURS CONSECUTIVELY IS NOT MADE WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE EXPENDITURE OF STRENGTH I WAS EXHAUSTED
THE PRETENDED BODY OF ORESTES CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THE SPARTANS AND OF THE BODY OF ASTERIUS TEN CUBITS LONG
ARE NOT ALL BODIES SUBJECT THROUGHOUT THEIR MASS TO THE POWER OF UNIVERSAL ATTRACTION THIS MASS OF WATER CANNOT ESCAPE THE GENERAL LAW AND IN SPITE OF THE HEAVY ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE ON THE SURFACE YOU WILL SEE IT RISE LIKE THE ATLANTIC ITSELF
WERE FOUND STONE HATCHETS AND FLINT ARROW HEADS STAINED AND ENCASED BY LAPSE OF TIME WITH A UNIFORM COAT OF RUST THE NOISE OF THIS DISCOVERY WAS VERY GREAT NOT IN FRANCE ALONE BUT IN ENGLAND AND IN GERMANY
I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST THESE POOR PRIESTS WHO AFTER ALL ARE VERY WRETCHED THEY RECEIVE FROM THE DANISH GOVERNMENT A RIDICULOUSLY SMALL PITTANCE AND THEY GET FROM THE PARISH THE FOURTH PART OF THE TITHE
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN VERTICAL DESCENT NOW BEGAN OUR REAL JOURNEY HITHERTO OUR TOIL HAD OVERCOME ALL DIFFICULTIES NOW DIFFICULTIES WOULD SPRING UP AT EVERY STEP
BUT I CANNOT BE SURE OF THAT UNTIL I HAVE REACHED THE VERY END OF THIS GALLERY YOU ARE RIGHT IN DOING THIS MY UNCLE AND I SHOULD QUITE APPROVE OF YOUR DETERMINATION IF THERE WERE NOT A DANGER THREATENING US NEARER AND NEARER WHAT DANGER THE WANT OF WATER
WHICH CAME TO PASS IN AN HOUR THE THREE ICELANDERS
PERHAPS WE MAY YET MEET WITH SOME OF THOSE SAURIANS WHICH SCIENCE HAS RECONSTRUCTED OUT OF A BIT OF BONE OR CARTILAGE I TOOK UP THE TELESCOPE AND SCANNED THE WHOLE HORIZON AND FOUND IT EVERYWHERE A DESERT SEA
THEN THE ZOOPHYTES OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD ALSO RETURN TO NOTHING I AM THE ONLY LIVING THING IN THE WORLD ALL LIFE IS CONCENTRATED IN MY BEATING HEART ALONE THERE ARE NO MORE SEASONS
SAID HE IN GENUINE TONES OF COMPASSION I WAS TOUCHED WITH THESE WORDS NOT BEING ACCUSTOMED TO SEE THE EXCITABLE PROFESSOR IN A SOFTENED MOOD I GRASPED HIS TREMBLING HANDS IN MINE HE LET ME HOLD THEM AND LOOKED AT ME
IF IT WERE NEEDED WE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE COMPELLED HIM TO REGAIN THE HEIGHTS OF SNAEFELL I DREW NEAR TO HANS I PLACED MY HAND UPON HIS HE MADE NO MOVEMENT MY PARTED LIPS SUFFICIENTLY REVEALED MY SUFFERINGS
HE ASKED YES CERTAINLY AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE DELIGHTFUL WELL TAKE MY ARM AXEL AND LET US FOLLOW THE WINDINGS OF THE SHORE I EAGERLY ACCEPTED AND WE BEGAN TO COAST ALONG THIS NEW SEA
SHOWED THAT IT MUST BE OF ELECTRIC ORIGIN IT WAS LIKE AN AURORA BOREALIS A CONTINUOUS COSMICAL PHENOMENON FILLING A CAVERN OF SUFFICIENT EXTENT TO CONTAIN AN OCEAN
AT THIS RATE HE SAID WE SHALL MAKE THIRTY LEAGUES IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND WE SHALL SOON COME IN SIGHT OF THE OPPOSITE SHORE I MADE NO ANSWER BUT WENT AND SAT FORWARD THE NORTHERN SHORE WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO DIP UNDER THE HORIZON
LIKE A MERE CONTINUATION OF THOSE FLOCK LIKE SUMMITS THE EYE COULD HARDLY TELL WHERE THE SNOWY RIDGES ENDED AND THE FOAMING WAVES BEGAN I WAS THUS STEEPED IN THE MARVELLOUS ECSTASY WHICH ALL HIGH SUMMITS DEVELOP IN THE MIND
WITH A BLANKET IN RAGS FOR A SAIL A STICK FOR A MAST AND FIERCE WINDS IN OUR TEETH WE CANNOT STEER WE SHALL BE BUFFETED BY THE TEMPESTS AND WE SHOULD BE FOOLS AND MADMEN TO ATTEMPT TO CROSS A SECOND TIME
HANS AND THE ICELANDERS NEVER STIRRED
THERE WERE BROAD TRACTS OF VAPOUR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR BUT THEN THE WEATHER WAS FINE THE PLAY OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT PRODUCED SINGULAR EFFECTS UPON THE UPPER STRATA OF CLOUD
THE POWER OF WHICH GREW BY THE EXTINCTION OF THE LESSER CRATERS SUPPLIED AN EGRESS TO LAVA
BUT MY DEAR UNCLE DO LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION OF COURSE AXEL HOW ABOUT RETURNING RETURNING WHY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RETURN BEFORE THE ARRIVAL NO
WE HAD GONE TWO LEAGUES SOUTH BUT SCARCELY A QUARTER OF A MILE DOWN MY UNCLE SAID IT WAS TIME TO GO TO SLEEP WE ATE WITHOUT TALKING AND WENT TO SLEEP WITHOUT REFLECTION OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE NIGHT WERE VERY SIMPLE
AND FROM THE DEEPEST DEPTHS OF THE EARTH I SAW MYSELF TOSSED UP AMONGST THE INTERPLANETARY SPACES UNDER THE FORM OF AN ERUPTIVE ROCK THE NEXT DAY JUNE TWENTY THIRD HANS WAS AWAITING US WITH HIS COMPANIONS CARRYING PROVISIONS TOOLS AND INSTRUMENTS
HANS HAD FITTED UP A RUDDER TO STEER HIS VESSEL HE TOOK THE TILLER AND UNMOORED THE SAIL WAS SET AND WE WERE SOON AFLOAT AT THE MOMENT OF LEAVING THE HARBOUR
THE COLD WAS EXCESSIVELY KEEN THE WIND WAS BLOWING VIOLENTLY I WAS EXHAUSTED
THERE IS SOMETHING ALARMING IN THE QUIETNESS ITSELF NOW COME MY UNCLE CRIED IF YOU ARE FRIGHTENED ALREADY
UNDERSTAND THIS CLEARLY ADDED THE PROFESSOR AT THE APPROACH OF AN ERUPTION THESE JETS WOULD REDOUBLE THEIR ACTIVITY BUT DISAPPEAR ALTOGETHER DURING THE PERIOD OF THE ERUPTION FOR THE ELASTIC FLUIDS BEING NO LONGER UNDER PRESSURE
MY HAIR STOOD ON END WITH TERROR THE BEWILDERING FEELING OF VACUITY LAID HOLD UPON ME I FELT MY CENTRE OF GRAVITY SHIFTING ITS PLACE AND GIDDINESS MOUNTING INTO MY BRAIN LIKE DRUNKENNESS
SUCH HIGH SPIRITS AS THESE WERE RATHER TOO STRONG BUT WHERE IS THE COMPASS I ASKED HERE IT IS UPON THIS ROCK IN PERFECT CONDITION AS WELL AS THE THERMOMETERS AND THE CHRONOMETER THE HUNTER IS A SPLENDID FELLOW
ON MY ARRIVAL ON THE SHORE I FOUND HANS SURROUNDED BY AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ARTICLES ALL ARRANGED IN GOOD ORDER MY UNCLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WITH A LIVELY GRATITUDE THIS MAN WITH ALMOST SUPERHUMAN DEVOTION
EACH OF US WILL STRAP ONE UPON HIS BACK I MEAN ONLY FRAGILE ARTICLES OF COURSE WE WERE NOT INCLUDED UNDER THAT HEAD HANS SAID HE
IT IS ONLY A FOREST OF MUSHROOMS SAID HE AND HE WAS RIGHT IMAGINE THE LARGE DEVELOPMENT ATTAINED BY THESE PLANTS WHICH PREFER A WARM MOIST CLIMATE
PRECIPICES LIKE LOW WALLS LAKES REDUCED TO PONDS RIVERS ABBREVIATED INTO STREAMS ON MY RIGHT WERE NUMBERLESS GLACIERS AND INNUMERABLE PEAKS SOME PLUMED WITH FEATHERY CLOUDS OF SMOKE
GOING UP IF YOU PLEASE GOING UP SAID MY UNCLE WITH A SHRUG NO DOUBT FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR THE INCLINES HAVE GONE THE OTHER WAY AND AT THIS RATE WE SHALL SOON ARRIVE UPON THE LEVEL SOIL OF ICELAND
CONSIDERABLE COMMOTIONS WERE STILL DISTURBING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THE LONG CONTINUED COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED CHASMS FISSURES CLEFTS AND FAULTS INTO WHICH VERY PROBABLY PORTIONS OF THE UPPER EARTH MAY HAVE FALLEN
AND LYCOPODS A HUNDRED FEET HIGH AGES SEEM NO MORE THAN DAYS I AM PASSED AGAINST MY WILL IN RETROGRADE ORDER THROUGH THE LONG SERIES OF TERRESTRIAL CHANGES PLANTS DISAPPEAR
AND HIS OPINION DIFFERS FROM MINE THE HEAD OF THIS FISH WAS FLAT BUT ROUNDED IN FRONT AND THE ANTERIOR PART OF ITS BODY WAS PLATED WITH BONY ANGULAR SCALES IT HAD NO TEETH
FOUR MONTHS CRIED THE PROFESSOR WE HAVE TIME TO GO AND TO RETURN
AND IF HE WAKES UP PRESENTLY WHERE SHALL WE BE IT WAS WORTH WHILE DEBATING THIS QUESTION AND I DID DEBATE IT I COULD NOT SLEEP FOR DREAMING ABOUT ERUPTIONS NOW THE PART OF EJECTED SCORIAE AND ASHES SEEMED TO MY MIND A VERY ROUGH ONE TO ACT
MY SILENCE WAS TAKEN FOR CONSENT AND THE DESCENT WENT ON ANOTHER THREE HOURS AND I SAW NO BOTTOM TO THE CHIMNEY YET WHEN I LIFTED MY HEAD I PERCEIVED THE GRADUAL CONTRACTION OF ITS APERTURE ITS WALLS BY A GENTLE INCLINE WERE DRAWING CLOSER TO EACH OTHER
THE CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE DAME AT PARIS COULD BE SET INSIDE ONE OF THE HALLS OF KARNAC AND NOT TOUCH THE WALLS THE WHOLE VALLEY AND DELTA OF THE NILE FROM THE CATACOMBS TO THE SEA WAS COVERED WITH TEMPLES PALACES TOMBS PYRAMIDS AND PILLARS
WHO CLAIM THAT THEIR CIVILIZATION CAME TO THEM ACROSS THE SEA IN SHIPS FROM THE EAST THAT IS FROM THE DIRECTION OF ATLANTIS THE MAYAS SUCCEEDED TO THE COLHUAS WHOSE ERA TERMINATED ONE THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE TIME OF CHRIST
AS IN THE FOLLOWING WHICH WE COPY FROM THE TABLET OF THE CROSS AT PALENQUE WE TAKE
TO SPEAK HUASI A HOUSE VAS TO INHABIT
THAT THE ART OF WRITING ON PAPYRUS WAS UNDERSTOOD AS EARLY AS THE DAYS OF MENES HIMSELF THE FRUITS OF INVESTIGATION IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER SUBJECTS ARE TRULY MOST MARVELLOUS
AND EITHER OF THESE FORMS BRINGS US QUITE CLOSE TO THE LETTER L OF THE OLD WORLD
THE LEFT HAND LINE WAS DROPPED AND WE COME TO THE FIGURE USED ON THE STONE OF MOAB
IN ARCHAIC PHOENICIAN IT COMES STILL CLOSER TO THE S SHAPE THUS
THEY CALLED THE REGION THEY LEFT IN THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
THE OLD HEBREW THE MOAB STONE
IT REMAINS A MONUMENT OF THE DESTRUCTION PRODUCED BY A SUCCESSION OF AGES IT STANDS SINGLE AND ALONE OF ITS KIND SURROUNDED BY IDIOMS THAT HAVE NO AFFINITY WITH IT WE HAVE SEEN THEM SETTLING IN THE EARLIEST AGES IN IRELAND
PERSONS WHO HAVE INHABITED BRITTANY AND THEN GO TO ALGERIA ARE STRUCK WITH THE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE ANCIENT ARMORICANS THE BRETONS AND THE CABYLES OF ALGIERS IN FACT THE MORAL AND PHYSICAL CHARACTER IS IDENTICAL
AND BECAME IN TIME PEROU OR PERU WAS NOT THE NUBIAN ISLAND OF MEROU WITH ITS PYRAMIDS BUILT BY RED MEN A SIMILAR TRANSPLANTATION
LIKE A FIGURE EIGHT HERE AGAIN WE TURN TO THE VALLEY OF THE NILE
AND THE VASTNESS OF THE REALM MAY BE JUDGED BY THE FACT THAT EACH OF THESE COULD MUSTER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND VASSALS FROM THEIR OWN ESTATES OR A TOTAL OF THREE MILLIONS AND WE HAVE ONLY TO READ OF THE VAST HORDES BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD AGAINST CORTEZ TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS NOT AN EXAGGERATION
THUS THE PUNIC T REPEATS THE MAYA FORM ALMOST EXACTLY AS
THERE WERE FOUND DEEP EXCAVATIONS WITH RUDE LADDERS HUGE MASSES OF ROCK BROKEN OFF ALSO NUMEROUS STONE TOOLS AND ALL THE EVIDENCES OF EXTENSIVE AND LONG CONTINUED LABOR IT IS EVEN SAID THAT THE GREAT ONTONAGON MASS OF PURE COPPER WHICH IS NOW IN WASHINGTON WAS EXCAVATED BY THESE ANCIENT MINERS
WAS CREATED AS A RESERVOIR FOR THE WATERS OF THE NILE IT WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE AND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET DEEP WITH SUBTERRANEAN CHANNELS FLOOD GATES LOCKS AND DAMS BY WHICH THE WILDERNESS WAS REDEEMED FROM STERILITY
SOME OTHER KINDRED WRITINGS THE VAU TAKES THE PLACE OF F AND INDICATES
THE VERY TRADITIONS TO WHICH WE HAVE REFERRED AS EXISTING AMONG THE PERUVIANS
THEY CULTIVATED FRUITS THEY USED THE SIGN OF THE CROSS EXTENSIVELY THEY CUT AND ENGRAVED PRECIOUS STONES AMONG THEIR CARVINGS HAVE BEEN FOUND REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ELEPHANT AND THE LION BOTH ANIMALS NOT KNOWN IN AMERICA THE FORMS OF SEPULTURE
AS WE HAVE NOT YET DISCOVERED ANY TRACE OF THE RUDE SAVAGE EGYPT BUT HAVE SEEN HER IN HER VERY EARLIEST MANIFESTATIONS ALREADY SKILFUL ERUDITE AND STRONG IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE ORDER OF HER INVENTIONS
SO LORD STRANGFORD WAS WRONG WHEN HE SUPPOSED THAT THE LAST VERB IN MI LIVED WITH THE LAST PATRIOT IN LITHUANIA PERU HAS STORES OF A GRAMMATICAL FORM WHICH HAS HAPPILY PERISHED IN EUROPE
AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THAT LANGUAGE IS THE SAME AS THE ONE INSCRIBED ON THE MOST ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF THEIR COUNTRY SENOR PIMENTAL SAYS OF THEM THE INDIANS HAVE PRESERVED THIS IDIOM WITH SUCH
MISOR GAVE BIRTH TO TAAUT THE GOD OF LETTERS THE INVENTOR OF THE ALPHABET AND TAAUT BECAME THOTH THE GOD OF HISTORY OF THE EGYPTIANS
AND AS THERE IS NO GOOD REASON WHY THEIR BUILDERS SHOULD HAVE AVOIDED ERECTING THEM ON THAT TERRACE WHILE THEY RAISED THEM PROMISCUOUSLY ON ALL THE OTHERS IT FOLLOWS NOT UNREASONABLY
ONE THIRD OF THIS TONGUE THE MAYA IS PURE GREEK WHO BROUGHT THE DIALECT OF HOMER TO AMERICA OR WHO TOOK TO GREECE THAT OF THE MAYAS GREEK IS THE OFFSPRING OF THE SANSCRIT IS MAYA OR ARE THEY COEVAL
TO USE THE WORDS OF A RECENT WRITER IN BLACKWOOD
MOST ANCIENT REMAINS OF MAN FOUND IN EUROPE ARE DISTINGUISHED BY A FLATTENING OF THE TIBIA AND THIS PECULIARITY IS FOUND TO BE PRESENT IN AN EXAGGERATED FORM IN SOME OF THE AMERICAN MOUNDS
AND IN ALL THESE OLD WORLD LANGUAGES
THE SAME SIGN WITH VERY LITTLE MODIFICATION WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY OBTAINED FROM THE MAYA ALPHABET AS THE SYMBOL FOR B TO ILLUSTRATE THIS WE PLACE THE SIGNS SIDE BY SIDE
I MIGHT PURSUE THOSE PARALLELS MUCH FARTHER BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THESE EXTRAORDINARY COINCIDENCES MUST HAVE ARISEN EITHER FROM IDENTITY OF ORIGIN OR LONG CONTINUED ANCIENT INTERCOURSE
PRECISELY AS IN THE MAYA THUS
ONE THEY WORSHIPPED THE SUN MOON AND PLANETS TWO THEY BELIEVED IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL THREE THEY BELIEVED IN THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY AND ACCORDINGLY EMBALMED THEIR DEAD
THE JUDGES WERE INDEPENDENT EVEN OF THE KING AND HELD THEIR OFFICES FOR LIFE THERE WERE SUPREME JUDGES FOR THE LARGER DIVISIONS OF THE KINGDOM DISTRICT JUDGES IN EACH OF THE PROVINCES AND MAGISTRATES CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
THE LETTERS THEN WHICH WE OWE TO THE PHOENICIANS ARE A B C D E H I K L M N O
IN A MOUND ON THE SCIOTO RIVER WAS FOUND AROUND THE NECK OF A SKELETON TRIPLE ROWS OF BEADS MADE OF MARINE SHELLS AND THE TUSKS OF SOME ANIMAL SEVERAL OF THESE SAYS SQUIER
CAN ANYTHING BE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN TO FIND THE SERPENT
MAIZE TOBACCO QUINOA AND THE MANDICO PLANTS HAVE BEEN CULTIVATED SO LONG THAT THEIR WILD ORIGINALS HAVE QUITE DISAPPEARED
IN A DESCRIPTION OF ONE LOT OF GOLDEN ARTICLES SENT TO SPAIN IN FIFTEEN THIRTY FOUR BY PIZARRO THERE IS MENTION OF
IN THE OLDEST KNOWN FORM OF THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABET THAT FOUND ON THE MOAB STONE WE FIND IN THE SAME WAY BUT ONE SIGN TO EXPRESS THE D AND T D DOES NOT OCCUR ON THE ETRUSCAN MONUMENTS T BEING USED IN ITS PLACE
THEY POSSESSED VARIOUS MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCES THEY WERE VERY PROBABLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE LATHE
COVERED DOUBTLESS BY HUNDREDS OF FEET OF VOLCANIC DEBRIS AN AMOUNT OF GOLD AND SILVER EXCEEDING MANY TIMES THAT BROUGHT TO EUROPE FROM PERU MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA SINCE THE TIME OF COLUMBUS A TREASURE WHICH IF BROUGHT TO LIGHT WOULD REVOLUTIONIZE THE FINANCIAL VALUES OF THE WORLD
ALL THESE FORMS SEEM TO BE REPRESENTATIONS OF A SERPENT WE TURN TO THE VALLEY OF THE NILE AND WE FIND THAT THE EGYPTIAN
AND PASSED THEIR TIME IN INDOLENT TRANQUILLITY
SAME LOVE OF INDEPENDENCE SAME INFLEXION OF THE VOICE SAME EXPRESSION OF FEELINGS LISTEN TO A CABYLE SPEAKING HIS NATIVE TONGUE AND YOU WILL THINK YOU BEAR A BRETON TALKING CELTIC THE BRETONS HE TELLS US FORM A STRONG CONTRAST TO THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM
THE ANCIENT GREEK WAS THE FOOT REVERSED
IN A FOSSIL STATE INDICATING AN IMMENSE ANTIQUITY THE TOLTECS POSSESSED A PURE AND SIMPLE RELIGION LIKE THAT OF ATLANTIS AS DESCRIBED BY PLATO WITH THE SAME SACRIFICES OF FRUITS AND FLOWERS THEY WERE FARMERS THEY RAISED AND WOVE COTTON
ALONG THESE GREAT ROADS CARAVANSARIES WERE ESTABLISHED FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF TRAVELLERS THESE ROADS WERE ANCIENT IN THE TIME OF THE INCAS THEY WERE THE WORK OF THE WHITE AUBURN HAIRED BEARDED MEN FROM ATLANTIS THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE THE TIME OF THE INCAS
WAS FOUND IN A MOUND IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF CHILLICOTHE IT IS COMPOSED OF A COMPACT VARIETY OF SLATE THIS STONE CUTS WITH GREAT CLEARNESS AND RECEIVES A FINE THOUGH NOT GLARING POLISH
AND T WERE PROBABLY INDICATED IN THE
THEY ALSO FORMED THE BASE OF THE DARK HAIRED POPULATION OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND THEY SEEM TO HAVE RACE AFFINITIES WITH THE BERBERS ON THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST OF AFRICA DOCTOR BODICHON FOR FIFTEEN YEARS A SURGEON IN ALGIERS SAYS
THE MOUND HAD EVERY APPEARANCE OF BEING AS OLD AS ANY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND WAS AT THE FIRST SETTLEMENT OF MARIETTA COVERED WITH LARGE TREES
COLUMBUS FOUND THE NATIVES MAKING SUCH VOYAGES IN OPEN CANOES IF THEN WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT THERE WAS NO ORIGINAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE INHABITANTS OF THE MAIN LAND AND OF ATLANTIS THE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY OF THE ATLANTEANS WOULD SOON REVEAL TO THEM THE SHORES OF THE GULF
AS TO IDENTIFY IN PROSE WHAT WE CALL THE POETRY THE IMAGINATIVE POWER NOT TREATING IT AS OUT OF PLACE AND A KIND OF VAGRANT INTRUDER BUT BY WAY OF AN ESTIMATE OF ITS RIGHTS THAT IS
AT LEAST IN THIS FIRST PART OF HIS JOURNAL
WHICH IF THEY APPLY TO THE LITERATURE OF FACT
MAKES US SEE THE PLACE AND THE ENTERPRISE HAS AT LEAST SUFFICIENT INTEREST TO KEEP BERNARD IN THE COUNTRY WHICH THE YOUNG PARISIAN DETESTS THIS PIQUANT EPISODE OF MY LIFE HE WRITES SEEMS TO ME TO BE REALLY DESERVING OF STUDY
IN THE ROTATIONS OF MIND THE PROVINCE OF POETRY IN PROSE WOULD FIND ITS ASSERTOR AND A CENTURY AFTER DRYDEN AMID VERY DIFFERENT INTELLECTUAL NEEDS AND WITH THE NEED THEREFORE OF GREAT MODIFICATIONS IN LITERARY FORM
BUT THE FINER EDGE OF WORDS STILL IN USE ASCERTAIN COMMUNICATE DISCOVER
WHAT MONSIEUR A HYPOCRITE MONSEIGNEUR
AND IT IS THE BUSINESS OF CRITICISM TO ESTIMATE THEM AS SUCH AS IT IS GOOD IN THE CRITICISM OF VERSE TO LOOK FOR THOSE HARD LOGICAL AND QUASI PROSAIC EXCELLENCES WHICH THAT TOO HAS OR NEEDS
ASSERT SOMETHING OF HIS OWN HUMOUR SOMETHING THAT COMES NOT OF THE WORLD WITHOUT BUT OF A VISION WITHIN SO GIBBON MOULDS HIS UNWIELDY MATERIAL TO A PRECONCEIVED VIEW
ON OUR SIDE THE SPECTATORS SIDE OF THIS PAINTED SCREEN WITH ITS PUPPETS WHO ARE REALLY GLAD OR SORRY ALL THE TIME WHAT PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE WHAT SORT OF EQUITY
OR AT THE NUNNERY AMONG THE NOVICES WITH THEIR LITTLE LIMITED PRIVILEGES WHERE IF YOU SPEAK YOU MUST NOT SHOW YOUR FACE OR IF YOU SHOW YOUR FACE YOU MUST NOT SPEAK
THEN SEATING HERSELF ON THE STEP OF THE BOOK CASE SHE SAID I MUST EXPLAIN MY FATHER TO YOU SHE WAS HALF A MINUTE COLLECTING HER THOUGHTS THEN SPEAKING WITH AN EXPANSION OF MANNER NOT HABITUAL WITH HER
A THING IN FACT NATURALLY DISTRESSING TO THE SCHOLAR WHO WILL THEREFORE EVER BE SHY OF OFFERING UNCOMPLIMENTARY ASSISTANCE TO THE READER'S WIT
CINTHIO'S RARE HISTORY OF PROMOS AND CASSANDRA ONE OF THAT NUMEROUS CLASS OF ITALIAN STORIES LIKE BOCCACCIO'S TANCRED OF SALERNO IN WHICH THE MERE ENERGY OF SOUTHERN PASSION HAS EVERYTHING ITS OWN WAY
IF I MUST NEEDS SUFFER THE INCONSOLABLE MISFORTUNE OF RENOUNCING THE HAPPINESS I HAD HOPED FOR ARE YOU QUITE SURE THAT THE MAN TO WHOM ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU WILL GIVE YOUR NIECE MAY NOT BE SOMETHING MORE THAN A SCEPTIC OR EVEN AN ATHEIST
ROSE MALLOWS IMMORTELLES ROSE PINKS IN SHORT WHAT PEOPLE CALL PARSONAGE FLOWERS
THE DUKE'S QUAINT BUT EXCELLENT MORALISING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT DOES BUT EXPRESS LIKE THE CHORUS OF A GREEK PLAY THE SPIRIT OF THE PASSING INCIDENTS TO HIM IN SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY
THAT THE GUILTY FIND MOST INDULGENCE AND THEN I AM NOT INDEED GUILTY I HAVE BUT WANDERED I AM REFUSED THE HAND OF YOUR NIECE BECAUSE I DO NOT SHARE HER FAITH YOUR OWN FAITH BUT MONSEIGNEUR
IT IS HERE THAT I HAVE PASSED THE PLEASANTEST HOURS OF MY YOUTH
HIS PECULIAR INTUITION OF A WORLD PROSPECTIVE OR DISCERNED BELOW THE FAULTY CONDITIONS OF THE PRESENT
AS INDEED IS CONGRUOUS WITH THE BLAND HALF HUMOROUS EQUITY WHICH INFORMS THE WHOLE COMPOSITION SINKING FROM THE HEIGHTS OF SORROW AND TERROR INTO THE ROUGH SCHEME OF THE EARLIER PIECE
WILL BE WELL AWARE OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE SCIENCE ALSO ATTAINING IN ITS TURN ITS TRUE LITERARY IDEAL AND THEN AS THE SCHOLAR IS NOTHING WITHOUT THE HISTORIC SENSE HE WILL BE APT TO RESTORE NOT REALLY OBSOLETE OR REALLY WORN OUT WORDS
AT THE SUGGESTION OF SHAME
TRAGIC CRISES INHERENT IN THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OF HUMAN NATURE ITSELF OR WHICH ARISE NECESSARILY OUT OF THE SPECIAL CONDITIONS OF MODERN SOCIETY STILL
IT IS SURELY THE STUPIDEST OF LOSSES TO CONFUSE THINGS WHICH RIGHT REASON HAS PUT ASUNDER TO LOSE THE SENSE OF ACHIEVED DISTINCTIONS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN POETRY AND PROSE FOR INSTANCE OR TO SPEAK MORE EXACTLY
AND WILL SHOW NO FAVOUR TO SHORT CUTS OR HACKNEYED ILLUSTRATION OR AN AFFECTATION OF LEARNING DESIGNED FOR THE UNLEARNED HENCE A CONTENTION
SO FAR I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE LITERARY ART ARISING OUT OF THE MEDIUM OR MATERIAL IN OR UPON WHICH IT WORKS THE ESSENTIAL QUALITIES OF LANGUAGE AND ITS APTITUDES FOR CONTINGENT ORNAMENTATION
IN THE JUST SPACING OUT OF WORD TO THOUGHT IN THE LOGICALLY FILLED SPACE CONNECTED ALWAYS WITH THE DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF DIFFICULTY OVERCOME DIFFERENT CLASSES OF PERSONS AT DIFFERENT TIMES MAKE OF COURSE VERY VARIOUS DEMANDS UPON LITERATURE
SO OFTEN ERRING OR CORRUPT IS A MAN OF SCRUPULOUS HONOUR
AND OF A TRUE DIGNITY IN DANGER GIVING EACH OTHER A SYMPATHETIC IF TRANSITORY REGRET ONE SORRY THAT ANOTHER SHOULD BE FOOLISHLY LOST AT A GAME OF TICK TACK
UNBELIEF IS NOT A CRIME IT IS A MISFORTUNE I KNOW PEOPLE OFTEN SAY A MAN DENIES GOD WHEN BY HIS OWN CONDUCT HE HAS BROUGHT HIMSELF INTO A CONDITION IN WHICH HE MAY WELL DESIRE THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST IN THIS WAY HE IS MADE GUILTY
AND WITH IT THE PREJUDICE THAT THERE CAN BE BUT ONE ONLY BEAUTY OF PROSE STYLE
TO THAT CHOSEN GROUP OF PERSONAGES IN WHICH HE LOVES TO TRACE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MORE SERIOUS ELEMENTS OF CHARACTER AMID THE REFINEMENTS AND ARTIFICES OF MODERN SOCIETY AND WHICH MAKE SUCH GOOD COMPANY
BECOMES A PLEADING A THEOREM NO LONGER BUT ESSENTIALLY AN APPEAL TO THE READER TO CATCH THE WRITER'S SPIRIT TO THINK WITH HIM IF ONE CAN OR WILL AN EXPRESSION NO LONGER OF FACT BUT OF HIS SENSE OF IT
HE KNOWS THE NARCOTIC FORCE OF THESE UPON THE NEGLIGENT INTELLIGENCE TO WHICH ANY DIVERSION LITERALLY IS WELCOME ANY VAGRANT INTRUDER BECAUSE ONE CAN GO WANDERING AWAY WITH IT FROM THE IMMEDIATE SUBJECT JEALOUS
EVEN ASSURED OF ITS CONGRUITY HE WILL STILL QUESTION ITS SERVICEABLENESS IS IT WORTH WHILE CAN WE AFFORD TO ATTEND TO JUST THAT TO JUST THAT FIGURE OR LITERARY REFERENCE JUST THEN
AND IN WHAT HE PROPOSES TO DO WILL HAVE IN MIND FIRST OF ALL THE SCHOLAR AND THE SCHOLARLY CONSCIENCE THE MALE CONSCIENCE IN THIS MATTER AS WE MUST THINK IT UNDER A SYSTEM OF EDUCATION WHICH STILL TO SO LARGE AN EXTENT LIMITS REAL SCHOLARSHIP TO MEN
THIS UNCLE AN ARTIFICIAL OLD PARISIAN IN MANNER BUT HONEST IN PURPOSE A GOOD TALKER AND FULL OF REAL AFFECTION FOR HIS HEIR BERNARD
BEHIND THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE BEHIND THEIR VARIOUS ACTION SHAKESPEARE INSPIRES IN US THE SENSE OF A STRONG TYRANNY OF NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCE THEN WHAT SHALL THERE BE ON THIS SIDE OF IT
ALL ALIKE WERE RUFFLED TO THE POINT OF ACTUAL SUFFERING
AND EVEN AS IT STANDS BUT THE PREPARATION ONLY WE MIGHT THINK OF A STILL MORE IMPOSING DESIGN FOR ONCE WE HAVE IN IT A REAL EXAMPLE OF THAT SORT OF WRITING WHICH IS SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS SUGGESTIVE
THAT MIGHT SEEM A SHADE TOO SERIOUS FOR LIPS SO YOUTHFUL MY FATHER SHE PROCEEDED DIED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A WOUND HE HAD RECEIVED AT PATAY THAT MAY SHOW YOU THAT HE LOVED HIS COUNTRY BUT HE WAS NO LOVER OF HIS OWN AGE
OF UNDERSTANDING AND BEING TOUCHED BY THE PRESENCE OF GREAT MATTERS IN SPITE OF THAT HAPPY LIGHTNESS OF HEART SO JEALOUSLY FENCED ABOUT
PRODUCT OF A MYRIAD VARIOUS MINDS AND CONTENDING TONGUES COMPACT OF OBSCURE AND MINUTE ASSOCIATION A LANGUAGE HAS ITS OWN ABUNDANT AND OFTEN RECONDITE LAWS
THE INTEREST OF MEASURE FOR MEASURE THEREFORE IS PARTLY THAT OF AN OLD STORY TOLD OVER AGAIN WE MEASURE WITH CURIOSITY THAT VARIETY OF RESOURCES WHICH HAS ENABLED SHAKESPEARE
WILL STILL TAKE THE PLACE OF FACT IN VARIOUS DEGREES YOUR HISTORIAN FOR INSTANCE WITH ABSOLUTELY TRUTHFUL INTENTION AMID THE MULTITUDE OF FACTS PRESENTED TO HIM MUST NEEDS SELECT AND IN SELECTING
IS BENT ON PROVIDING HIM WITH A WIFE AND INDEED HAS ONE IN VIEW THE ACCOMPLISHED BERNARD WITH MANY GRACES OF PERSON BY HIS OWN CONFESSION TAKES NOTHING SERIOUSLY AS TO THAT MATTER OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
THERE IS NO MIDDLE COURSE OF LIFE DESIRABLE IF I CANNOT ATTAIN THE ONE I MUST MAKE THE BEST OF THE OTHER HARRIETT PHILLIPS LISTENED TO ALL THIS
BUT AS TO THE PRESENT THEIR VIEWS ARE SURE TO BE CORRECT SAID FRANCIS IF THEY ARE GOOD SPIRITS AND NOT LYING SPIRITS WE PRAYED AGAINST THEIR APPEARANCE AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE SPIRIT
HARRIETT OPENED IT AND WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE ELSIE HOLDING IN HER HAND THE SECOND BONNET COMPLETED EQUALLY BEAUTIFUL EQUALLY TASTEFUL AND APPARENTLY QUITE AS EXPENSIVE OH
FOR MISSUS PHILLIPS HAS BEEN SO GOOD AS TO ASK ME TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS IN LONDON AND MISSUS DUNN IS GOING TO SPARE ME WELL I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID MISS THOMSON FOR IT SEEMS TO ME YOU WANT A CHANGE AND A REST
AND HER HABITUAL ASSUMPTION THAT SHE KNEW EVERYTHING MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE BECAME TIRESOME WHEN HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN HER SUPERIORITY HE BEGAN TOO TO CONTRAST THE CHARM OF A FACE
WHEN FRANCIS GOT INTO THE OPEN AIR AFTER THE EXCITEMENT OF THE EVENING
MISS RENNIE WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM LEAVING WILLIAM DALZELL AND THE STRANGER TOGETHER BUT SHE PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT MISS WILSON WAS DISENGAGED AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE INTRODUCED TO MISTER DALZELL
I MET THEM LAST NIGHT AT A PARTY HOW DO YOU DO MISS MELVILLE SAID HE SHAKING HANDS WITH ELSIE FIRST AND THEN WITH JANE BUT WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE ON THIS DAY SAID PEGGY
AND YOU TOO DOES THE LETTER IN MY POCKET COME FROM MY MOTHER THE THREE RAPS REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE DID YOU GIVE HER AN ANNUITY AS SHE SAYS YOU DID A SINGLE RAP MEANING NO WAS THE REPLY
HIS PLACE AT THE BANK OF SCOTLAND WAS FILLED UP
BEREAVEMENT IN ALL ITS VARIED BITTERNESS HAS BEEN SUNG BY MANY POETS IN STRAINS WORTHY OF THE SUBJECT BUT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SO INSIDIOUS AND OFTEN SO PROSAIC THAT THEIR TRAGICAL OPERATION HAS BEEN RARELY TREATED OF IN VERSE
WHO HAD SO LONG MOURNED FOR HER YOUNGEST BORN THAT HE WAS EXPECTING HER SOON TO JOIN HIM IN THE SPIRIT LAND THE PLACE WHERE THE OLD LADY LIVED WAS MENTIONED AND HER STATE OF HEALTH WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING BAD ALL PERFECTLY TRUE PERFECTLY TRUE MISTER HOGARTH
CHAPTER THREE ELSIE'S SITUATION IT WAS NOT MERE FANCY ON JANE'S PART THAT ELSIE WAS ILL AND UNHAPPY
BUT TO OTHERS WHO LIKE MANY BEFORE HIM HAD INTELLIGENTLY ACCEPTED OF A STERNER THEOLOGY AND WHO HAD BEEN STRUGGLING THROUGH YEARS OF CHAOTIC DOUBTS AND FANCIES FOR FOOTING ON WHICH TO REST HE SAW THAT THESE ASSURANCES GAVE REAL STRENGTH AND SUPPORT
CANNOT BE DELIVERED BY A GOOD SPIRIT THEN YOU STILL CONTINUE TO BE THE JUDGES OF THE SPIRITS YOU DO NOT BOW YOUR MORALITY TO THEIRS YOU SELECT AND REJECT AS YOU SEE GOOD MORALITY IS UNIVERSAL AND ETERNAL
AND AT THIS TIME LESS THAN EVER AND SHE TURNED TO AN ELDERLY LADY OF A VERY PLEASING COUNTENANCE WHO WITH A PRETTY GIRL OF THIRTEEN ENTERED THE SHOWROOM AT THAT MOMENT OH MISS THOMSON SAID MISS RENNIE SHAKING HANDS WITH THE NEW COMER HOW DO YOU DO
SHE HAD MAGNANIMOUSLY MADE UP HER MIND TO GO TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY AND SPIRIT AND MISSUS DUNN WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HER BUT SHE MISSED JANE'S SOCIETY FAR MORE THAN HER SISTER COULD MISS HERS
LOST HER RELISH FOR BOTH SHE HAS FELT THAT HER ESTIMATE OF HER POWERS HAS BEEN TOO GREAT AND NOW IT IS FAR TOO HUMBLE FOR MYSELF I THINK JUST AS HIGHLY OF MY OWN ABILITIES AND ACQUIREMENTS AS EVER I DID
FOR ALL THINGS AND PEOPLE COLONIAL BUT ABOVE ALL MISS PHILLIPS'S WANT OF CONSIDERATION FOR ALICE MELVILLE HAD WEANED MISTER BRANDON'S HEART FROM HER
AND HAD BEEN KIND TO WILLIE WHEN HE WAS IN HIS LAST ILLNESS JANE SOMETIMES WITH AND SOMETIMES WITHOUT ELSIE HAD ALWAYS GONE TO TELL THIS WOMAN ABOUT THE WORK BUT ON THIS OCCASION PEGGY HAD TO TAKE THE LONG WALK HERSELF
MISSUS DALZELL HAS BEEN TO SEE US AND BEEN SO GRACIOUS AFTER ALL WHAT BETTER LUCK COULD SHE LOOK FOR THAN TO BE MARRIED FOR HER MONEY WITH SUCH A TEMPER AS SHE HAS TOO HE CERTAINLY IS HANDSOME BUT FOR MY PART
AND THIS WEEK SHE HAD HAD MORE WORK THAN SHE COULD MANAGE
IT IS STILL LESS ARGUMENTATIVE BUT IT HAS THE KNACK OF BRINGING OUT DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THEM WE PITY THE FRENCH FOR THEIR WANT OF POLITICAL LIBERTY BUT THE SOCIAL FREEDOM THEY ENJOY IS SOME COMPENSATION
WITH ALL THESE DRAWBACKS SHE IMPROVED SO MUCH IN TASTE AND SKILL THAT MISSUS DUNN RAISED HER WAGES OR SALARY AS SHE GENTEELLY CALLED IT AND PUT HER AT THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT IN WHICH SHE SO MUCH EXCELLED
AND WITH THE IMPROVEMENT IT WOULD MAKE IN HER APPEARANCE TO OBSERVE THE EARNEST ANXIOUS LOOKS OF HER TWO FANCIED ADMIRERS AS THEY GREETED HER SISTER'S LADY'SMAID OR THAT THEY LOOKED WITH INTEREST AND CONCERN ON HER TIRED FACE
ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AFTER SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS BUSINESS MISS RENNIE AND MISS WILSON CAME IN WITH MOST IMPORTANT LOOKING FACES WHILE MISS WILSON WAS BUSIED TURNING OVER THE FASHION BOOKS HER FRIEND WHISPERED TO ELSIE
MISS WILSON WAS WARD OF MISSUS RENNIE'S AS JANE HAD HEARD A WEST INDIAN HEIRESS SOMEWHAT STUPID AND VERY MUCH IMPRESSED WITH HER OWN WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE MISS RENNIE HAD A PITYING SORT OF LIKING FOR HER
BUT IF A BODY'S MOVING AND STIRRING ABOUT THEY CAN AYE KEEP HEAT IN THEM IF MOVING AND STIRRING CAN KEEP YOU WARM YOU WILL NEVER BE COLD BUT PEGGY YOU WILL WANT TO HEAR THE NEWS INDEED DO I SAID PEGGY
AND I WILL HELP HIM TO DO SO WE WOMEN HAVE NO CAREER FOR OURSELVES AND WE MUST FIND ROOM FOR AMBITION SOMEWHERE
AND MADE HER LOOK MORE LOVELY THAN EVER
WHO HAS BEEN DOING SO WELL AT SCHOOL AND BEEN SUCH A GOOD GIRL ALTOGETHER THAT I MUST NEEDS GIVE HER A NEW FROCK FOR A PARTY SHE IS INVITED TO NEXT WEEK AND GET IT FASHIONABLY MADE TOO NO DOUBT THIS IS NOT THE DRESSMAKING ROOM MISS MELVILLE IS THE MILLINER
ALL WILL BE WELL IN THE END WAS SPELLED OUT DID YOU SEE YOUR NIECES SUFFERINGS UNMOVED THEIR POVERTY THEIR DISAPPOINTMENTS THEIR UNFITNESS FOR THE WORK THAT YOU HAD SET THEM TO DO THEY ARE BETTER FOR WHAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED WAS SPELLED OUT
FRANCIS PASSED HIS FINGER ALONG THE ALPHABET HALF DISDAINFULLY HALF IN CURIOSITY THE RAP STOPPED HIM AT THE LETTER H HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT THE CURIOUS LITTLE TAPS SOUNDED SO UNEARTHLY BEFORE
JANE WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED IN OCCUPATIONS THAT DEMANDED INTELLIGENCE AND THOUGHT SHE HAD ACCESS TO BOOKS SHE WENT TO THEATRES AND PLACES OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENT EVEN MORE THAN SHE CARED FOR
HAVE A SORT OF CONVICT ORIGIN MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT AT THAT TIME FOR THEM THAN FOR RETIRED INDIANS TO GET INTO GENERAL SOCIETY THERE WAS NO NICE DISTINCTION DRAWN BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COLONIES BETWEEN NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA
THE SPIRIT WAS IN THE RIGHT NOT TO ANSWER IT ARE YOU CONVINCED SAID MISTER DEMPSTER WHO HAD SEEN THE SURPRISE WITH WHICH MISTER HOGARTH HAD SPELLED OUT THE ANSWERS I AM STAGGERED SAID FRANCIS
THOUGH I CERTAINLY LIKE HIS SERMONS AND HIS DEVOTIONAL SERVICES VERY MUCH IT IS CERTAINLY NOT THE LEAST OF THE BLESSINGS OF MY ADVERSITY THAT I HAVE LEARNED TO PLACE MYSELF IN GOD'S HANDS AND TO FEEL THAT HE WILL DO ALL THINGS WELL FOR ME
I HAVE LEARNED UPON HOW VERY LITTLE THE HUMAN SOUL CAN BE KEPT IN WORKING ORDER FROM A POOR RHEUMATIC AND BED RIDDEN OLD WOMAN WHO IS SO GRATEFUL FOR THE USE OF ONE HAND WHILE SHE IS HELPLESS OTHERWISE
FRANCIS HAD HOPED TO SEE HIS COUSINS BEFORE HE MET THEM AT THE PARTY BUT WHEN HE CALLED AT PEGGY WALKER'S HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE OUT TAKING THEIR CUSTOMARY LONG WALK SO HE MET THEM IN MISSUS RENNIE'S DRAWING ROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND TOO GENERALLY DONE BY THE ENCLOSED BEDS WHICH ARE NOT RIGHT THINGS IN A SANITARY POINT OF VIEW THE MONEY VALUE OF THE RENT IS INCREASED TOO
I CONFESS THAT IF I WERE IN THEIR PLACE I SHOULD DO THE SAME BUT LET MY EXPERIMENT SUCCEED IT MAY BE IMITATED WHETHER IT IS IMITATED OR NOT
IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET UP THE CLASSES THAT I HOPED FOR I THINK I MUST TAKE TO MISSUS DUNN'S AND THE DRESSMAKING FOR WE CANNOT GO ON AS WE ARE DOING AH JANE MY CUP OF PROSPERITY HAS VERY MANY BITTER DROPS IN IT
SHE FELT ALL THE MORE EXHAUSTED BY IT AS FOR HER POETRY SHE APPEARED TO BE UNABLE TO WRITE A LINE AND THOUGH SHE SOMETIMES COULD READ AN OLD BOOK SHE SEEMED QUITE UNFIT TO PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING NEW
I AM SORRY THAT YOUR MINISTER HAS LEFT HIS CHURCH FOR I HOPED TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH HIM AND HE LOOKED SO CHEERFUL THAT I THOUGHT HE MIGHT DO ELSIE GOOD THIS NEW CLERGYMAN DOES NOT STRIKE ME AS BEING SO GENIAL OR KINDLY
AND SHE DID NOT LIKE BEING DECEIVED OR MISTAKEN AND SHE STILL LESS LIKED TO MAKE MISTAKES AND INSTEAD OF BLAMING HERSELF SHE WAS ANGRY WITH EVERYONE ELSE HER BROTHER HER SISTER IN LAW
OR SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND TASMANIA IN THOSE DAYS A SLIGHT SAVOUR OF BOTANY BAY WAS SUPPOSED TO HANG ABOUT THEM ALL BUT THEY FORMED A PLEASANT LITTLE CLIQUE OF THEIR OWN LESS EXCLUSIVE THAN MOST CLIQUES
WHICH PUT QUITE AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT COMPLEXION ON THE PROCEEDINGS AFTER THE MOMENT BEFORE'S OBSERVATIONS ABOUT BOYHOOD DAYS AND THE TURF RECOLLECTING TWO OR THREE PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS OF HIS OWN WHICH THE OTHER TWO WERE AS MUTUALLY INNOCENT OF AS THE BABE UNBORN EVENTUALLY HOWEVER
STAINS ON HIS COAT SLOBBERS HIS FOOD I SUPPOSE TASTES ALL DIFFERENT FOR HIM HAVE TO BE SPOONFED FIRST LIKE A CHILD'S HAND HIS HAND LIKE MILLY'S WAS SENSITIVE

AND CISSY TUCKED IN THE BALL AND THE SPADES AND BUCKETS AND IT WAS HIGH TIME TOO BECAUSE THE SANDMAN WAS ON HIS WAY FOR MASTER BOARDMAN JUNIOR AND CISSY TOLD HIM TOO THAT BILLY WINKS WAS COMING AND THAT BABY WAS TO GO DEEDAW
AND BLOOM OF COURSE WITH HIS KNOCKMEDOWN CIGAR PUTTING ON SWANK WITH HIS LARDY FACE PHENOMENON THE FAT HEAP HE MARRIED IS A NICE OLD PHENOMENON
IS THAT BERGAN HURRY UP TERRY BOY SAYS ALF TERENCE O'RYAN HEARD HIM
I'VE A THIRST ON ME I WOULDN'T SELL FOR HALF A CROWN GIVE IT A NAME CITIZEN SAYS JOE WINE OF THE COUNTRY SAYS HE WHAT'S YOURS SAYS JOE DITTO MAC ANASPEY SAYS I THREE PINTS TERRY SAYS JOE AND HOW'S THE OLD HEART CITIZEN SAYS HE

HE PUT IT BACK IN HIS SIDEPOCKET AND TOOK FROM HIS WAISTCOATPOCKET A NICKEL TINDERBOX SPRANG IT OPEN TOO AND HAVING LIT HIS CIGARETTE HELD THE FLAMING SPUNK TOWARDS STEPHEN IN THE SHELL OF HIS HANDS YES OF COURSE HE SAID AS THEY WENT ON AGAIN
BUCK MULLIGAN SHOWED A SHAVEN CHEEK OVER HIS RIGHT SHOULDER GOD ISN'T HE DREADFUL HE SAID FRANKLY A PONDEROUS SAXON HE THINKS YOU'RE NOT A GENTLEMAN GOD THESE BLOODY ENGLISH BURSTING WITH MONEY AND INDIGESTION
NOW HE WAS LAID TO REST AND HER MOTHER SAID TO HIM TO LET THAT BE A WARNING TO HIM FOR THE REST OF HIS DAYS AND HE COULDN'T EVEN GO TO THE FUNERAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE GOUT
SHE MIGHT NOW BE ROLLING IN HER CARRIAGE SECOND TO NONE OVER AND OVER HAD SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT AS SHE MUSED BY THE DYING EMBERS IN A BROWN STUDY WITHOUT THE LAMP BECAUSE SHE HATED TWO LIGHTS
SO SHE JUST LIFTED HER SKIRT A LITTLE BUT JUST ENOUGH AND TOOK GOOD AIM AND GAVE THE BALL A JOLLY GOOD KICK AND IT WENT EVER SO FAR AND THE TWO TWINS AFTER IT DOWN TOWARDS THE SHINGLE
SLIFE I'LL BE ROUND WITH YOU I CANNOT BUT EXTOL THE VIRILE POTENCY OF THE OLD BUCKO THAT COULD STILL KNOCK ANOTHER CHILD OUT OF HER ALL FELL TO PRAISING OF IT EACH AFTER HIS OWN FASHION THOUGH THE SAME YOUNG BLADE HELD WITH HIS FORMER VIEW THAT ANOTHER THAN HER CONJUGIAL HAD BEEN THE MAN IN THE GAP
THERE WAS NO GETTING BEHIND THAT DELIBERATELY KICKED THE BALL AS HARD AS EVER HE COULD DOWN TOWARDS THE SEAWEEDY ROCKS NEEDLESS TO SAY POOR TOMMY WAS NOT SLOW TO VOICE HIS DISMAY BUT LUCKILY THE GENTLEMAN IN BLACK WHO WAS SITTING THERE BY HIMSELF
BATH OF COURSE DOES THAT JUST A BITE OR TWO THEN ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK I CAN SIX SIX TIME WILL BE GONE THEN SHE MILD FIRE OF WINE KINDLED HIS VEINS

THE BLOODY MONGREL BEGAN TO GROWL THAT'D PUT THE FEAR OF GOD IN YOU SEEING SOMETHING WAS UP BUT THE CITIZEN GAVE HIM A KICK IN THE RIBS
HER WOMAN'S INSTINCT TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD RAISED THE DEVIL IN HIM AND AT THE THOUGHT A BURNING SCARLET SWEPT FROM THROAT TO BROW TILL THE LOVELY COLOUR OF HER FACE BECAME A GLORIOUS ROSE EDY BOARDMAN WAS NOTICING IT TOO
TILL THEN THEY HAD ONLY EXCHANGED GLANCES OF THE MOST CASUAL BUT NOW UNDER THE BRIM OF HER NEW HAT SHE VENTURED A LOOK AT HIM AND THE FACE THAT MET HER GAZE THERE IN THE TWILIGHT WAN AND STRANGELY DRAWN
AND ONE NIGHT I WENT IN WITH A FELLOW INTO ONE OF THEIR MUSICAL EVENINGS SONG AND DANCE ABOUT SHE COULD GET UP ON A TRUSS OF HAY SHE COULD MY MAUREEN LAY AND THERE WAS A FELLOW WITH A BALLYHOOLY BLUE RIBBON BADGE SPIFFING OUT OF HIM IN IRISH
WITH HER HAT ANYHOW ON HER TO ONE SIDE AFTER HER RUN AND SHE DID LOOK A STREEL TUGGING THE TWO KIDS ALONG WITH THE FLIMSY BLOUSE SHE BOUGHT ONLY A FORTNIGHT BEFORE LIKE A RAG ON HER BACK AND A BIT OF HER PETTICOAT HANGING LIKE A CARICATURE
WHERE REGGY WYLIE USED TO TURN HIS FREEWHEEL LIKE SHE READ IN THAT BOOK THE LAMPLIGHTER BY MISS CUMMINS AUTHOR OF MABEL VAUGHAN AND OTHER TALES FOR GERTY HAD HER DREAMS THAT NO ONE KNEW OF SHE LOVED TO READ POETRY
THERE ARE SOME LIKE THAT DAVY BYRNE SAID HE'S A SAFE MAN I'D SAY HE'S NOT TOO BAD NOSEY FLYNN SAID SNUFFLING IT UP
THE INDIVIDUAL WHOSE VISUAL ORGANS WHILE THE ABOVE WAS GOING ON WERE AT THIS JUNCTURE COMMENCING TO EXHIBIT SYMPTOMS OF ANIMATION
AND RED GREEN YELLOW BROWN RUSSET SWEET BIG BITTER RIPE POMELLATED APPLES
THE RECORDED INSTANCES OF MULTISEMINAL TWIKINDLED AND MONSTROUS BIRTHS CONCEIVED DURING THE CATAMENIC PERIOD OR OF CONSANGUINEOUS PARENTS IN A WORD ALL THE CASES OF HUMAN NATIVITY WHICH ARISTOTLE HAS CLASSIFIED IN HIS MASTERPIECE
I PAID THE RENT NOW I EAT HIS SALT BREAD GIVE HIM THE KEY TOO ALL
BOTH THEIR EYES MET AND AS SOON AS IT BEGAN TO DAWN ON HIM THAT THE OTHER WAS ENDEAVOURING TO HELP HIMSELF TO THE THING HE INVOLUNTARILY DETERMINED TO HELP HIM HIMSELF AND SO HE ACCORDINGLY TOOK HOLD OF THE NECK OF THE MEDIUMSIZED GLASS RECIPIENT WHICH CONTAINED THE FLUID SOUGHT AFTER
WHEN IS LONG JOHN GOING TO HANG THAT FELLOW IN MOUNTJOY SAYS JOE BERGAN SAYS BOB DORAN WAKING UP IS THAT ALF BERGAN YES SAYS ALF
WAS SCRUPULOUSLY NEAT AND CLEAN IT WAS THERE SHE KEPT HER GIRLISH TREASURE TROVE THE TORTOISESHELL COMBS HER CHILD OF MARY BADGE
HE WILL NEVER FORGET THE NAME EVER REMEMBER THE NIGHT FIRST NIGHT THE BRIDENIGHT THEY ARE ENTWINED IN NETHERMOST DARKNESS THE WILLER WITH THE WILLED AND IN AN INSTANT
SCREENED UNDER FERNS SHE LAUGHED WARMFOLDED WILDLY I LAY ON HER KISSED HER EYES HER LIPS HER STRETCHED NECK BEATING WOMAN'S BREASTS FULL IN HER BLOUSE OF NUN'S VEILING
BETWEEN THE NISUS FORMATIVUS OF THE NEMASPERM ON THE ONE HAND AND ON THE OTHER A HAPPILY CHOSEN POSITION SUCCUBITUS FELIX OF THE PASSIVE ELEMENT THE OTHER PROBLEM RAISED BY THE SAME INQUIRER IS SCARCELY LESS VITAL INFANT MORTALITY
ALLAH AMID WHICH THE RINGING EVVIVA OF THE DELEGATE OF THE LAND OF SONG A HIGH DOUBLE F RECALLING THOSE PIERCINGLY LOVELY NOTES WITH WHICH THE EUNUCH CATALANI BEGLAMOURED OUR GREATGREATGRANDMOTHERS WAS EASILY DISTINGUISHABLE IT WAS EXACTLY SEVENTEEN O'CLOCK
TODAY THE BARDS MUST DRINK AND JUNKET IRELAND EXPECTS THAT EVERY MAN THIS DAY WILL DO HIS DUTY THAT REMINDS ME HAINES SAID RISING THAT I HAVE TO VISIT YOUR NATIONAL LIBRARY TODAY OUR SWIM FIRST BUCK MULLIGAN SAID HE TURNED TO STEPHEN AND ASKED BLANDLY
IT WAS CALLED BY LOUIS J WALSH MAGHERAFELT AND AFTER THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT TWILIGHT WILT THOU EVER AND OFTTIMES THE BEAUTY OF POETRY SO SAD IN ITS TRANSIENT LOVELINESS HAD MISTED HER EYES WITH SILENT TEARS
EIS AND EDY AND CISSY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TIME ALL THE TIME AND ASKING HER BUT GERTY COULD PAY THEM BACK IN THEIR OWN COIN AND SHE JUST ANSWERED WITH SCATHING POLITENESS WHEN EDY ASKED HER WAS SHE HEARTBROKEN ABOUT HER BEST BOY THROWING HER OVER
SO I SAW THERE WAS GOING TO BE A BIT OF A DUST BOB'S A QUEER CHAP WHEN THE PORTER'S UP IN HIM SO SAYS I JUST TO MAKE TALK HOW'S WILLY MURRAY THOSE TIMES ALF I DON'T KNOW SAYS ALF I SAW HIM JUST NOW IN CAPEL STREET WITH PADDY DIGNAM
CISSY SAID THANKS AND CAME BACK WITH HER TONGUE OUT AND SAID UNCLE SAID HIS WATERWORKS WERE OUT OF ORDER THEN THEY SANG THE SECOND VERSE OF THE TANTUM ERGO AND CANON O'HANLON GOT UP AGAIN AND CENSED THE BLESSED SACRAMENT AND KNELT DOWN
THE BLIND STRIPLING DID NOT ANSWER HIS WALLFACE FROWNED WEAKLY HE MOVED HIS HEAD UNCERTAINLY YOU'RE IN DAWSON STREET MISTER BLOOM SAID MOLESWORTH STREET IS OPPOSITE
BUT WITH ALL THE THINGAMERRY SHE WAS ALWAYS RUBBING INTO IT SHE COULDN'T GET IT TO GROW LONG BECAUSE IT WASN'T NATURAL SO SHE COULD JUST GO AND THROW HER HAT AT IT SHE RAN WITH LONG GANDERY STRIDES
IS IT SOME PARADOX POOH BUCK MULLIGAN SAID WE HAVE GROWN OUT OF WILDE AND PARADOXES IT'S QUITE SIMPLE HE PROVES BY ALGEBRA THAT HAMLET'S GRANDSON IS SHAKESPEARE'S GRANDFATHER AND THAT HE HIMSELF IS THE GHOST OF HIS OWN FATHER WHAT
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS FEASIBLE IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT PAY
SOMEHOW WHAT ROLLIN PAGE HAD SAID AND HIS MANNER IN SAYING IT HAD HASTENED HER DECISION IN THE MATTER WOULD YOU MIND TELLING US RACHEL YOUR REASONS FOR REFUSING THE OFFER
IS IT THEN SUCH A TREMENDOUS EVENT THAT TWO CHRISTIAN MINISTERS SHOULD BE NOT ONLY WILLING BUT EAGER TO LIVE CLOSE TO THE MISERY OF THE WORLD IN ORDER TO KNOW IT AND REALIZE IT IS IT SUCH A RARE THING THAT LOVE OF HUMANITY SHOULD FIND THIS PARTICULAR FORM OF EXPRESSION IN THE RESCUE OF SOULS
THEY HAD BOTH REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION BY THE SAME REASONING AND THEY WERE TOO THOUGHTFUL TOO WELL ACCUSTOMED TO THE MEASURING OF CONDUCT TO UNDERESTIMATE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR POSITION WHAT IS YOUR PLAN THE BISHOP AT LAST SPOKE GENTLY LOOKING WITH THE SMILE THAT ALWAYS BEAUTIFIED HIS FACE
THE STREET WAS NARROW AND THE SIDEWALK CROWDED SUDDENLY OUT OF THE DOOR OF THIS SALOON A YOUNG WOMAN REELED SHE WAS SINGING IN A BROKEN DRUNKEN SOB
I SHALL NOT STAY HERE THEN SAID MADAM PAGE SHE TURNED SUDDENLY AND WALKED TO THE END OF THE HALL SHE THEN CAME BACK AND GOING UP TO VIRGINIA SAID WITH AN EMPHASIS THAT REVEALED HER INTENSIVE EXCITEMENT OF PASSION
AND WAS SILENT THE CARRIAGE ROLLED ON PAST TWO BLOCKS OF MAGNIFICENT PRIVATE RESIDENCES
THE BISHOP REPLIED TO ONE VALUED FRIEND WHO HAD ALMOST WITH TEARS TRIED TO DISSUADE HIM FROM HIS PURPOSE WHY SHOULD WHAT DOCTOR BRUCE AND I PROPOSE TO DO SEEM SO REMARKABLE A THING AS IF IT WERE UNHEARD OF THAT A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY AND A BISHOP SHOULD WANT TO SAVE LOST SOULS IN THIS PARTICULAR MANNER
EDWARD NORMAN
I COULD HARDLY MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT ONLY A FEW NIGHTS AGO A DOZEN MEN BECAME HONESTLY AND EARNESTLY ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION OVER RELIGIOUS MATTERS I HAVE HAD THE GREAT JOY OF SEEING SOME OF THE MEN GIVE UP BAD HABITS AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE
REEKING WITH THE FUMES OF LIQUOR BE CARED FOR IN VIRGINIA'S OWN HOME INSTEAD OF BEING CONSIGNED TO STRANGERS IN SOME HOSPITAL OR HOUSE OF CHARITY VIRGINIA REALLY KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT ANY SUCH PLACES OF REFUGE AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE WERE TWO OR THREE SUCH INSTITUTIONS IN RAYMOND BUT
VIRGINIA HAVE YOU NOT LEARNED MY SECRET VIRGINIA LOOKED BEWILDERED THEN OVER HER FACE THE UNUSUAL COLOR CREPT SHOWING THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD I HAVE NEVER LOVED ANY ONE BUT RACHEL WINSLOW ROLLIN SPOKE CALMLY ENOUGH NOW
HE CONFRONTED IT WITH A DEGREE OF HESITATION AND A FEELING NEARLY AKIN TO FEAR HE HAD COME DOWN TO THE OFFICE VERY EARLY AND FOR A FEW MINUTES WAS BY HIMSELF HE SAT AT HIS DESK IN A GROWING THOUGHTFULNESS THAT FINALLY BECAME A DESIRE WHICH HE KNEW WAS AS GREAT AS IT WAS UNUSUAL
MADAM PAGE WAITED UNTIL THE SERVANT HAD BROUGHT IN SOMETHING AND THEN ASKED HER TO GO OUT
SHE SIMPLY SAW A SOUL THAT HAD TASTED OF THE JOY OF A BETTER LIFE
IT WOULD UPSET EVERY CUSTOM AND INTRODUCE ENDLESS CONFUSION IT WAS SIMPLY FOOLISHNESS IT WAS DOWNRIGHT IDIOCY
IT WAS FALL AGAIN AND THE CITY FACED ANOTHER HARD WINTER THE BISHOP ONE AFTERNOON CAME OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT AND WALKED AROUND THE BLOCK INTENDING TO GO ON A VISIT TO ONE OF HIS NEW FRIENDS IN THE DISTRICT
IT WAS A SMALL BUT WELL EQUIPPED CARPENTER'S SHOP A YOUNG MAN WITH A PAPER CAP ON HIS HEAD AND CLAD IN BLOUSE AND OVERALLS WAS WHISTLING AND DRIVING THE PLANE AS HE WHISTLED HE LOOKED UP AS THE TWO ENTERED AND TOOK OFF HIS CAP AS HE DID SO HIS LITTLE FINGER CARRIED A SMALL CURLING SHAVING UP TO HIS HAIR AND IT CAUGHT THERE
HE HAD WALKED ABOUT FOUR BLOCKS WHEN HE WAS ATTRACTED BY A SHOP THAT LOOKED DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS STILL QUITE NEW TO HIM AND EVERY DAY HE DISCOVERED SOME STRANGE SPOT OR STUMBLED UPON SOME UNEXPECTED HUMANITY
IF THEY ARE KIND AND GIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE POOR AND I AM SURE THAT HE HIMSELF IS PRETTY COMFORTABLY SETTLED HE NEVER GIVES UP HIS LUXURIES JUST BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE GO HUNGRY WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO IF HE DID I TELL YOU FELICIA
IT IS YOUR HOME WITH ME AS LONG AS YOU CHOOSE TO REMAIN BUT IN THIS MATTER I MUST ACT AS I FULLY BELIEVE JESUS WOULD IN MY PLACE I AM WILLING TO BEAR ALL THAT SOCIETY MAY SAY OR DO SOCIETY IS NOT MY GOD BY THE SIDE OF THIS POOR SOUL
ROLLIN SPOKE WITH ENTHUSIASM HIS FACE WAS TRANSFORMED BY HIS INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT WHICH HAD NOW BECOME A PART OF HIS REAL LIFE RACHEL AGAIN NOTED THE STRONG MANLY TONE OF HIS SPEECH
WHEN I ASKED AS YOU DID WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS MY ANSWER
NORMAN DID NOT SPEAK FOR A MINUTE THEN HE SAID ABRUPTLY CLARK
BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT IS A VERY UNUSUAL EXAMPLE CAN YOU IMAGINE HERE VIRGINIA NAMED HALF A DOZEN FAMOUS OPERA SINGERS DOING ANYTHING OF THIS SORT NO I CANNOT ROLLIN ANSWERED BRIEFLY
AND THE ATTENDANT WAS STILL HOLDING THE DOOR OPEN FOR THE YOUNGER WHO STOOD HESITATING ON THE CURB
HE COULD NOT GRASP THE MEANING OF IT ALL HE FELT ENRAGED AND ALARMED HE WAS SURE ANY SUCH POLICY WOULD RUIN THE PAPER AS SOON AS IT BECAME GENERALLY KNOWN THAT THE EDITOR WAS TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING BY SUCH AN ABSURD MORAL STANDARD WHAT WOULD BECOME OF BUSINESS IF THIS STANDARD WAS ADOPTED
ROLLIN WHY DO YOU TREAT HER WITH SUCH A DISTINCT PRECISE MANNER I THINK ROLLIN PARDON ME IF I HURT YOU THAT SHE IS ANNOYED BY IT YOU NEED TO BE ON EASY TERMS I DON'T THINK RACHEL LIKES THIS CHANGE
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS EVIDENT TO HERSELF THAT HER EMOTION WAS NOT THAT OF REGRET OR SORROW SOMEHOW A GLAD NEW JOY HAD COME TO HER
ARE YOU THE FLUSH OF PLEASURE MOUNTED TO THE YOUNG CARPENTER'S FOREHEAD
IF WE WERE TO RESIGN OUR CHARGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GOING TO BOMBAY OR HONG KONG OR ANY PLACE IN AFRICA THE CHURCHES AND THE PEOPLE WOULD EXCLAIM AT THE HEROISM OF MISSIONS
WHAT OTHER TIME DO THEY HEAR HER IT'S A GREAT PITY I SAY THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC OUTSIDE OF RAYMOND CANNOT HEAR HER VOICE LET US TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SAID RACHEL A LITTLE SHARPLY MADAM PAGE GLANCED AT HER AND SPOKE WITH A GENTLE COURTESY MY DEAR ROLLIN NEVER COULD
NO I DON'T SUPPOSE HE WOULD WELL THAT'S MY ONLY REASON FOR SHUTTING THIS ACCOUNT OUT OF THE NEWS
AND YET THAT NIGHT WHILE SHE SANG I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT FOR THE TIME BEING I NEVER THOUGHT OF HER VOICE EXCEPT AS GOD'S MESSAGE I BELIEVE THAT ALL MY PERSONAL LOVE FOR HER WAS FOR THE TIME MERGED INTO A PERSONAL LOVE TO MY GOD AND MY SAVIOUR
DID YOU EVER KNOW OF A GIRL OF SUCH REALLY GIFTED POWERS IN VOCAL MUSIC WHO WAS WILLING TO GIVE HER LIFE TO THE PEOPLE AS RACHEL IS GOING TO DO SHE IS GOING TO GIVE MUSIC LESSONS IN THE CITY HAVE PRIVATE PUPILS TO MAKE HER LIVING
WE HAVE MET BEFORE SAID FELICIA LOOKING AT CLYDE FRANKLY YES BACK IN THE WORLD AS THE BISHOP SAYS REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS FINGERS TREMBLED A LITTLE AS THEY LAY ON THE BOARD HE HAD BEEN PLANING YES FELICIA HESITATED I AM VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU
WOULD JESUS DO THAT THAT IS WOULD HE PROBABLY RUN A NEWSPAPER ON SOME LOVING FAMILY PLAN
BUT VIRGINIA WHAT A WONDERFUL AMOUNT OF GOOD CAN BE DONE WITH THIS MONEY AND THE SALOON CANNOT ALWAYS REMAIN HERE THE TIME MUST COME WHEN THE CHRISTIAN FORCES IN THE CITY WILL TRIUMPH VIRGINIA PAUSED NEAR RACHEL AND HER PALE EARNEST FACE LIGHTED UP
BUT NOT ALL YOUR PASTOR HENRY MAXWELL ONE OTHER LETTER WHICH HE OPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER READING THIS FROM MAXWELL REVEALED TO HIM SOMETHING OF THE LOSS TO HIS BUSINESS THAT POSSIBLY AWAITED HIM MISTER EDWARD NORMAN EDITOR OF THE DAILY NEWS DEAR SIR
IT EVEN BETTER THAN YOU DO SHE IS DRUNK AT THIS MINUTE BUT SHE IS ALSO A CHILD OF GOD I HAVE SEEN HER ON HER KNEES REPENTANT AND I HAVE SEEN HELL REACH OUT ITS HORRIBLE FINGERS AFTER HER AGAIN AND BY THE GRACE OF CHRIST
ON THE WAY HE COULD NOT AVOID THAT CONSTANT QUERY WOULD JESUS HAVE DONE IT
AS THE HORSES WERE DRIVEN RAPIDLY UP TO THE CURB HELD THERE IMPATIENTLY BY THE DRIVERS WHO HAD SHIVERED LONG IN THE RAW EAST WIND AND THEN LET GO TO PLUNGE FOR A FEW MINUTES INTO THE RIVER OF VEHICLES THAT TOSSED UNDER THE ELEVATED RAILWAY AND FINALLY WENT WHIRLING OFF UP THE AVENUE
I SUPPOSED OF COURSE THAT WAS PUBLIC PROPERTY SAID VIRGINIA SMILING ACROSS THE TABLE I WAS IN THE NEWS OFFICE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY YES YES REPLIED RACHEL HASTILY I UNDERSTAND THAT MADAM PAGE
SHE ASKED IN A COLD SNEERING VOICE THAT HURT VIRGINIA MORE THAN ANYTHING SHE HAD YET FELT YES I SAID SO VIRGINIA'S FACE FLUSHED BUT SHE SEEMED TO RECALL A VERSE THAT MISTER GRAY HAD USED FOR ONE OF HIS RECENT SERMONS
HAS BEEN DONE BY OUR SUNDAY MORNING PAPER I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT JESUS WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT IF HE WERE IN MY PLACE TODAY IT WILL OCCASION SOME TROUBLE TO ARRANGE THE DETAILS CAUSED BY THIS CHANGE WITH THE ADVERTISERS AND SUBSCRIBERS THAT IS FOR ME TO LOOK AFTER THE CHANGE ITSELF IS ONE THAT WILL TAKE PLACE
WHAT PURPOSE I COULD NOW HAVE IN MY LIFE TO REDEEM IT TO SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP AND THE MORE I THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE I WAS DRIVEN TO A PLACE WHERE I KNEW I MUST TAKE UP THE CROSS
ANOTHER THING I HAVE ACTUALLY INTERESTED SOME OF THEM IN THE RECTANGLE WORK AND WHEN IT IS STARTED UP THEY WILL GIVE SOMETHING TO HELP MAKE IT MORE POWERFUL AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS FROM GOING TO THE BAD IN GAMBLING
THE PAST SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN HIS WONDERFUL CONVERSION HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN IT BUT HE SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY CAUGHT UP FOR THIS PRESENT TIME IN THE PURPOSE OF HIS NEW LIFE
GRANDMOTHER WE CALL OURSELVES CHRISTIANS HERE IS A POOR LOST HUMAN CREATURE WITHOUT A HOME SLIPPING BACK INTO A LIFE OF MISERY AND POSSIBLY ETERNAL LOSS
WHO MOANED AND SOBBED AND NOW CLUNG TO HER AS FIRMLY AS BEFORE SHE HAD REPULSED HER SO THE TWO MOVED ON THROUGH THE RECTANGLE TOWARD THE EVANGELIST'S LODGING PLACE THE SIGHT SEEMED TO IMPRESS THE RECTANGLE SERIOUSLY
IN RETURN FOR WHICH I WILL POST HIM AS NO GENTLEMAN AND GIVE THE EVIDENCE REPLIED BRIARLY I WILL TAKE HIS PLACE YOU WILL HEAR FROM ME SHORTLY SAID THE SECOND TURNING AWAY BE SURE YOU DON'T OWE YOUR TAILOR ANY THING
OLD FELLOW THIS IS PREMEDITATED POVERTY BETTER WEAR PATCHED GARMENTS THAN OWE FOR NEW ONES REPLIED TOM WITH GREAT SOBRIETY BLESS US WHEN DID YOU TURN ECONOMIST EVER SINCE I TRIED TO BE A GENTLEMAN
A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH L WAS SLOW EITHER TO NOTICE OR RESENT IT HAPPENED ONE DAY THAT THE TAILOR OF BRIARLY ASKED HIM IF HE KNEW ANY THING ABOUT L NOT MUCH REPLIED BRIARLY WHY DO YOU ASK
BESIDES SUNDRY INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD COME AS THE MINISTER'S FRIENDS OR ACCUSERS PERKINS WHO HAD PUT THE REPORT IN CIRCULATION WAS THERE AT THE SPECIAL REQUEST OF ONE OF THE DEACONS WHO HAD ASCERTAINED THAT HE HAD AS MUCH OR A LITTLE MORE TO SAY IN THE MATTER THAN ANY ONE
WHEN A YOUNG MAN WELL KNOWN IN THE LITERARY CIRCLES MADE HIS APPEARANCE AND WAS RECEIVED WITH A DEGREE OF FAVOUR THAT CONFOUNDED THE OFFICER WHO HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO THINK HIMSELF SURE OF THE PRIZE
DON'T AS A GENERAL THING POSSESS MUCH TO BRAG OF THEN HE TALKS TO YOU OF HIS HONOUR OH YES AND GIVES ME HIS WORD AS A GENTLEMAN DOES HE ALWAYS KEEP HIS WORD AS A GENTLEMAN
SO HE TOOK UP THE CASE AGAIN AND ONCE MORE GAVE A PRESCRIPTION IN A COUPLE OF DAYS THE GENTLEMAN WAS QUITE WELL AGAIN BUT THAT MISSUS
WE CONVERSED ASIDE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND I GAVE HIM MY VIEWS OF THE CASE AND STATED WHAT I HAD DONE AND WHY I HAD DONE IT WE THEN PROCEEDED TO THE BEDSIDE OF OUR PATIENT THERE WERE STILL NO SIGNS OF APPROACHING CONSCIOUSNESS
HE DOESN'T PAY HIS TAILOR HE DOESN'T PAY HIS BOOT MAKER HE DOESN'T PAY HIS HATTER HE IS THEREFORE NO GENTLEMAN AND I CANNOT FIGHT HIM YOU WILL BE POSTED AS A COWARD SAID THE SECOND FIERCELY
TREATING A CASE ACTIVELY A PHYSICIAN'S STORY
FORTUNATELY THE BODY MOVED WITH THE HEAD OR THE CONSEQUENCES MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERIOUS THERE WERE PLENTY TO ASSURE L THAT FOR THIS INSULT HE MUST IF HE WISHED TO BE CONSIDERED A GENTLEMAN CHALLENGE BRIARLY AND SHOOT HIM IF HE COULD
NO NOR A DUCK GUN WITH TRUMPET MUZZLE BUT AN INFERNAL PEN A WHAT
BUT A TOO ARDENT DEVOTION TO THIS BOTTLE BROUGHT ON THE SUPPOSED APOPLEXY DOCTOR S WAS RIGHT IN HIS MODE OF TREATING THE DISEASE AFTER ALL AND DID NOT ERR IN SUPPOSING THAT IT WOULD REACH THE PREDISPOSITION
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE AT THE WORDS TIPSY PARSON THE MINISTER BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH AND SO DID TWO OR THREE OTHERS WHO HAD BEEN AT MISTER REESIDE'S THE GRAVE DEACON IN THE CHAIR LOOKED AROUND WITH FROWNING WONDER AT SUCH INDECORUM
CERTAINLY HE IS AN OFFICER FIGHTING IS HIS TRADE WELL LET HIM WHAT'LL YOU DO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE OF COURSE AND FIGHT CERTAINLY HE'LL SHOOT YOU I'M NOT AFRAID
WHAT CONSEQUENCES YOUR PRINCIPAL WILL BE POSTED AS A COWARD BEFORE NIGHT ARE YOU MAD NO COOL AND EARNEST WE FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE ABOUT
WHY NOT ASKED THE SECOND OF L IN SURPRISE BECAUSE YOUR PRINCIPAL IS NO GENTLEMAN WHAT IS NO GENTLEMAN COOLLY RETURNED BRIARLY EXPLAIN YOURSELF SIR IF YOU PLEASE
I CAN TESTIFY UPON OATH THAT HE WAS AS SOLEMN AS A JUDGE WHO SAYS THAT I MADE SO SCANDALOUS AN ALLEGATION BURTON APPEARED TO GROW STRONGLY EXCITED I SAY SO CRIED PERKINS IN A LOUD VOICE YOU SAY SO
YES DEAR YOU HAVE BEEN VERY ILL WE FEARED FOR YOUR LIFE SAID MISSUS H AFFECTIONATELY THERE HAVE BEEN TWO PHYSICIANS IN ATTENDANCE H CLOSED HIS EYES AGAIN HIS LIPS MOVED
BY NO MEANS FOUNDED THEREON HIS CLAIM TO BE CALLED A GENTLEMAN HE NEVER LIKED L BECAUSE HE SAW THAT HE HAD NO PRINCIPLE WHATEVER THAT ALL ABOUT HIM WAS MERE SHAM THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT HE WAS HARDLY CIVIL TO HIM
WE MAY PUT ON AIRS OF GENTILITY BOAST OF INDEPENDENCE AND SPIRIT AND ALL THAT BUT IT'S A MEAN KIND OF GENTILITY THAT WILL LET A MAN FLOURISH ABOUT IN A FINE COAT FOR WHICH HE OWES HIS TAILOR
YOU MAY EXPECT TO RECEIVE SUMMARY PUNISHMENT FOR YOUR INSOLENCE ONE OF THESE CHARACTERS MADE HIMSELF QUITE CONSPICUOUS IN BALTIMORE A FEW YEARS AGO HIS NAME WAS L AND HE HAILED FROM RICHMOND WE BELIEVE
THREATENED WITH APOPLEXY I SUPPOSE HE THEN SAID INTERROGATIVELY YES DEAR REPLIED HIS WIFE
HE HAD ALSO WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED ONE OR TWO POPULAR WORKS THIS GAVE HIM A STANDING AS AN AUTHOR TAKE HIM ALL IN ALL HE WAS A RIVAL TO BE FEARED AND REDMOND WAS NOT LONG IN MAKING THE DISCOVERY WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
WHICH YOU TOOK WITH SO MUCH CONFIDENCE I DO NOT REPLIED THE GENTLEMAN HUMPH WELL I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT NINE TENTHS OF IT IS CHEAP BRANDY OR NEW ENGLAND RUM
AS FOR THE LIEUTENANT HE DECLARES THAT HE HAD AS LIEF COME IN CONTACT WITH A PAIXHAN GUN AS AN AUTHOR WITH HIS INFERNAL PEN
AND WAS THEN REMOVED IT HAD DONE GOOD SERVICE DRESSINGS WERE THEN APPLIED REPEATED AND REPEATED AGAIN BUT STILL THE SICK MAN LAY IN A DEEP STUPOR IT HAS DONE NO GOOD
AND IN THE END ACTUALLY DESTROYED THE PRESCRIPTION AND POURED DOWN HIS THROAT A GLASS OF
AS THE CHURCH DEEMED THE MATTER FAR TOO SERIOUS TO BE PASSED LIGHTLY OVER THE MINISTER WAS EVIDENTLY A GOOD DEAL SURPRISED AND STARTLED AT THIS BUT HE NEITHER DENIED THE CHARGE NOR ATTEMPTED ANY PALLIATION MERELY SAYING THAT HE WOULD ATTEND OF COURSE
MY BONDS ARE INTERNAL PRINCIPLES I AM TEMPERATE BECAUSE INTEMPERANCE IS SIN FOR MEN WHO HAVE ABUSED THEIR FREEDOM AND SO FAR LOST ALL RATIONAL CONTROL OVER THEMSELVES THAT THEY CANNOT RESIST THE INSANE SPIRIT OF INTEMPERANCE
HE MAY DIE IN HALF AN HOUR I DON'T THINK THE CASE IS SO DANGEROUS MADAM APOPLEXY NOT DANGEROUS I HARDLY THINK IT APOPLEXY I REPLIED PRAY WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS DOCTOR
I FOUND HIM LYING UPON THE FLOOR WHERE HE HAD TO ALL APPEARANCE FALLEN SUDDENLY FROM HIS CHAIR HIS FACE IS PURPLE AND THOUGH HE BREATHES IT IS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY I WENT UP TO SEE MY PATIENT
PERHAPS HE HAS TAKEN SOME DRUG I REPLIED IMPOSSIBLE DOCTOR SAID THE WIFE HE HAS NOT BEEN FROM HOME TO DAY AND THERE IS NO DRUG OF ANY KIND IN THE HOUSE NO BRANDY I VENTURED THIS SUGGESTION AGAIN
BUT MY HEAD WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH MY HEAD IT FEELS AS IF SCALDED WHERE'S MY HAIR HEAVENS AND EARTH SARAH I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS AND MY ARM WHAT'S MY ARM TIED UP IN THIS WAY FOR
BUT HE STILL LAY AS INSENSIBLE AS BEFORE MUCH TO THE DISTRESS OF HIS POOR WIFE SOMETHING ELSE MUST BE DONE DOCTOR SHE URGED SEEING THAT BLEEDING HAD ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING
BLAKE MUST BE CHALLENGED AND KILLED OFF AND THEN THE COURSE WOULD BE CLEAR A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS BRAVE AND HONOURABLE DETERMINATION THE OFFICER MET THE AUTHOR IN A PUBLIC PLACE AND PURPOSELY JOSTLED HIM RUDELY
EVERY MAN MUST BE PERMITTED TO HAVE HIS OWN STANDARD OF GENTILITY CERTAINLY I HAVE MINE AH WELL HOW DO YOU MEASURE GENTILITY BY MY LEDGER
THE PRESCRIPTION OF A REGULAR PHYSICIAN OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS PRACTICE SET ASIDE FOR A QUACK NOSTRUM RECOMMENDED BY A BAR KEEPER A FINE COMPLIMENT TO COMMON SENSE AND THE PROFESSION TRULY
MISTER PERKINS SAID THE PRESIDING DEACON AS FAR AS WE CAN LEARN THIS SCANDALOUS CHARGE ORIGINATED WITH YOU I WILL THEREFORE ASK YOU
THE PARSON WAS PRETTY READY WITH THE TONGUE AND RARELY CAME OFF SECOND BEST WHEN HIS OPPONENTS DRAGGED HIM INTO A CONTROVERSY ALTHOUGH HIS ARGUMENTS WERE CALLED BY THEM WHEN HE WAS NOT PRESENT MERE FUSTIAN
A MAN WHO DOESN'T PAY HIS TAILOR'S BILL I CONSIDER NO GENTLEMAN IF L SENDS ME A CHALLENGE I WILL REFUSE TO FIGHT HIM ON THAT GROUND
THE PLEDGE IS ALL IMPORTANT SIGN IT I SAY IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN BUT DO NOT SIGN IT BECAUSE THIS THAT OR THE OTHER TEMPERATE MAN HAS SIGNED IT BUT BECAUSE YOU FEEL IT TO BE YOUR ONLY HOPE DO IT FOR YOURSELF
WITH PENS FOR WEAPONS HE WILL WING YOU A LITTLE TOO QUICK NO DOUBT BUT THE PUBLIC WON'T BEAR HIM OUT SUCH AN OUTRAGE SUCH A VIOLATION OF ALL THE RULES OF HONOUR
AT ALL POINTS LORD MISTLETOE WHO HAD A LARGE FAMILY OF HIS OWN LIVED TWENTY MILES OFF SO THAT THE FATHER AND SON COULD MEET PLEASANTLY WITHOUT FEAR OF QUARRELLING DURING THE FIRST EVENING ARABELLA DID CONTRIVE TO MAKE HERSELF VERY AGREEABLE
WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM A LITTLE LATE HE WAS NOT THERE WE WON'T WAIT DUCHESS SAID THE DUKE TO HIS WIFE AT THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE DUKE'S PUNCTUALITY AT DINNER TIME WAS WELL KNOWN AND EVERYBODY ELSE WAS THEN ASSEMBLED
AND I WON'T STOP YOU I AM SO MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU MISTER RUGGLES SAID KATE NOT SCRUPLING FOR A MOMENT TO TAKE THE ADVANTAGE OFFERED HER THE FOX HAD TURNED A LITTLE TO THE LEFT WHICH WAS IN LARRY'S FAVOUR
AND TO MAKE A FICTITIOUS CAST TO THE LEFT AS THOUGH HE THOUGHT THE FOX HAD TRAVERSED THAT WAY TONY KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THE FOX WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN LITTLETON GORSE BUT HE KNEW ALSO THAT THE GORSE WAS ONLY SIX ACRES
THE FIRST LETTER HE MIGHT HAVE IGNORED HE MIGHT HAVE LEFT IT UNANSWERED WITHOUT GROSS MISCONDUCT BUT THE SECOND LETTER WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD DECLARED TO BE A SERIOUS EPISTLE WAS ONE WHICH HE COULD NOT NEGLECT
AND ASK ONESELF WHETHER ONE REALLY LIKES IT HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS WORKING HARD STRUGGLING TO BE HAPPY PAINFULLY ANXIOUS TO BE SURE THAT HE WAS ENJOYING THE LUXURY OF BEING IN LOVE
AND SIX IN LONDON IN WHICH HE GAVE DINNERS AND DINED OUT AND REGULARLY TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS WITHOUT EVER OPENING HIS MOUTH HE WAS A GREY HAIRED COMELY MAN OF SIXTY WITH A LARGE BODY AND A WONDERFUL APPETITE
SHE HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR MEETING HIM AS AN OLD FRIEND WITHOUT CAUSING SURPRISE AND HAD GAINED THAT STEP BUT SHOULD SHE SUCCEED AS SHE HOPED
PEOPLE ALWAYS ARE AREN'T THEY PERHAPS LADIES ARE WE WERE BUT ALL THAT ABOUT THE CARRIAGES MISTER MORTON WASN'T MY DOING MAMMA HAD BEEN TALKING TO ME SO MUCH THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I WAS ON MY HEAD OR MY HEELS
I DON'T KNOW THAT GETTING ALONG EASY IS WHAT WE HAVE PARTICULARLY GOT IN VIEW SAID MISTER GOTOBED WHO WAS CERTAINLY IN QUEST OF INFORMATION BUT IT IS WHAT I HAVE IN VIEW MISTER GOTOBED SO IF YOU PLEASE WE'LL TAKE THE PRE EMINENCE OF YOUR COUNTRY FOR GRANTED
YOU LIVE IN THESE PARTS SIR ASKED THE SENATOR IN THE TOWN YONDER BECAUSE MISTER MORTON'S HOUSEKEEPER SEEMS TO KNOW YOU SHE KNOWS ME VERY WELL AS I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THIS HOUSE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
OF COURSE I DID WHEN YOU SHOWED SO PLAINLY THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM TO JOIN YOU WHAT WAS I TO DO I COULDN'T SEND HIM AWAY MISTER TWENTYMAN IS A VERY INTIMATE FRIEND OF OURS AND VERY KIND TO DOLLY AND KATE
HIS NEIGHBOUR HAD SAID SOME WORD TO HIM IN JOKE AS TO HIS ATTACHMENT TO MISS TREFOIL AND AFTER THE LADIES HAD LEFT THE ROOM ANOTHER NEIGHBOUR OF THE OTHER SEX HAD HOPED THAT HE HAD HAD A PLEASANT TIME ON THE ROAD
AND OF HER SURPRISE THAT SHE SHOULD BE SUMMONED TO HIS BEDSIDE OF COURSE SHE WOULD GO THOUGH SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD WITH SATISFACTION TO A MEETING WITH THE HONBLE MISSUS MORTON
ON THE SATURDAY LARRY CAME TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF MISTER MASTERS WHO WAS STILL IN HIS OFFICE AT HALF PAST SEVEN MISSUS MASTERS AT ONCE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND CONVEYED HIM AWAY INTO THE SACRED DRAWING ROOM
IN THE CARRIAGE SHE HAD ASKED HIM WHETHER HE LOVED HER AND HE HAD SAID THAT HE DID HE HAD ALSO DECLARED THAT HE WOULD DO ANYTHING IN HIS POWER TO MAKE HER HAPPY WAS A MAN TO BE BOUND TO MARRY A GIRL BECAUSE OF SUCH A SCENE AS THAT THERE WAS HOWEVER
I AM TO GO TO THE MEET SOME DAY AND HE'LL BE THERE IT MIGHT BE DANGEROUS NONSENSE MAMMA AND AFTER ALL YOU'VE BEEN SAYING ABOUT DROPPING MISTER MORTON BUT THERE IS NOTHING SO BAD AS A USELESS FLIRTATION DO I EVER FLIRT
AND COULD THE SENATOR HAVE READ THE FEELINGS OF THE DOZEN LEADING MEN IN THE RUN HE WOULD HAVE OWNED THAT THEY WERE FOR THE TIME SATISFIED WITH THEIR AMUSEMENT COULD HE HAVE READ KATE MASTERS FEELINGS HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO OWN THAT SHE WAS IN AN EARTHLY PARADISE
I THINK I'VE WON MY BET SAID THE HOTEL KEEPER
HE HAS GONE HIS WAY AND I HAVE GONE MINE AND I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE PRAY REMEMBER ME TO HIM LADY AUGUSTUS SAID SHE WOULD AND DID ENTERTAIN SOME LITTLE INCREASED RESPECT FOR THE CLERGYMAN WHO COULD BOAST THAT HE HAD BEEN TIPSY IN COMPANY
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS TOM WELL WHAT IS IT IF THIS HAD COME FROM ANY OTHER MAN THAN YOURSELF I SHOULD QUARREL WITH HIM I AM NOT ENGAGED TO THE YOUNG LADY NOR HAVE I DONE ANYTHING TO WARRANT ANYBODY IN SAYING SO
LADY USHANT WROTE TO POSTPONE THE VISIT BECAUSE SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO BRAGTON HER LETTER TO MARY THOUGH AFFECTIONATE WAS VERY SHORT HER GRAND NEPHEW JOHN THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY
A THUNDERBOLT AT HER FEET COULD HARDLY HAVE SURPRISED OR ANNOYED HER MORE IF THERE WAS ONE THING THAT SHE WANTED LESS THAN ANOTHER IT WAS THE PRESENCE OF THE PARAGON AT MISTLETOE IT WOULD UTTERLY SUBVERT EVERYTHING AND ROB HER OF EVERY CHANCE
YOU FOUND ONE FOX DEAD AND YOU DIDN'T KILL ANOTHER BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T TRY WELL MISTER MORTON I DON'T THINK I SHALL TAKE TO FOX HUNTING EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD INTRODUCE IT IN MICKEWA WHAT'S BECOME OF THE REST OF THE MEN MOST OF THEM ARE IN THE BROOK SAID NED BOTSEY AS HE RODE ON TOWARDS DILLSBOROUGH
THE OLD DRAGON TOOK CARE OF THAT REPLIED ARABELLA
WITH A GREAT EFFORT SHE RESTRAINED ALL EMOTION AND SIMPLY SHOOK HER HEAD SHE DID IT VERY WELL AND BETRAYED NOTHING I ASK SAID THE DUCHESS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED TO MARRY HIM LORD DRUMMOND TELLS ME THAT HE IS A MOST RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN
MARY IS NOT GOING SHE SAID NOT GOING TO CHELTENHAM IT HAS ALL BEEN PUT OFF SHE SHAN'T GO AT ALL IF I CAN HELP IT BUT WHY HAS IT BEEN PUT OFF MISSUS MASTERS
TO MORROW WILL BE FRIDAY AND THE DUKE HAS HIS GREAT SHOOTING ON SATURDAY THERE'S NOTHING WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES OF US ON SATURDAY I SHALL GO WITH THE PYTCHLEY IF I DON'T SHOOT BUT I SHALL HAVE TO GET UP JUST WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BED THAT WOULDN'T SUIT YOU
WAS EVER A GIRL CALLED UPON TO RISK HER ENTIRE FATE UNDER SO MANY DISADVANTAGES WHEN SHE WENT UP TO DRESS FOR DINNER ON THE DAY OF HIS EXPECTED ARRIVAL LORD RUFFORD HAD NOT COME SINCE THE INTERVIEW IN HER AUNT'S ROOM SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIS NAME MENTIONED
WITHIN TWO MINUTES AFTER THE DUKE'S WORD DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED AND A PARTY NUMBERING ABOUT THIRTY WALKED AWAY INTO THE DINNER ROOM ARABELLA WHEN THEY WERE ALL SETTLED FOUND THAT THERE WAS A VACANT SEAT NEXT HERSELF IF THE MAN WERE TO COME FORTUNE WOULD HAVE FAVOURED HER IN THAT
AND THE SENATOR AND THE PARAGON WERE NOW RETURNING ALONG THE ROAD TOWARDS BRAGTON THE FOX HAD TRIED HIS OLD EARTHS AT IMPINGTON HIGH WOOD AND HAD THEN SKULKED BACK ALONG THE OUTSIDE OF THE COVERT HAD NOT ONE OF THE WHIPS SEEN HIM
THE GIRL WAS HIS NIECE AND THE DUKE HAD AN IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE KIND TO THE FAMILY OF WHICH HE WAS THE HEAD HIS BROTHER'S WIFE HAD BECOME OBJECTIONABLE TO HIM BUT AS TO THE GIRL IF SHE WANTED A HOME FOR A WEEK OR TWO HE THOUGHT IT TO BE HIS DUTY TO GIVE IT TO HER
HE POSITIVELY RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MARRY ARABELLA TREFOIL HE WAS BEING HUNTED AND RUN DOWN AND WITH THE INSTINCT OF ALL ANIMALS THAT ARE HUNTED HE PREPARED HIMSELF FOR ESCAPE
AND HE WAS STILL IN HIS MIND SAYING EVIL THINGS OF THE U R U RESPECTING THAT POISONED FOX PERHAPS HE WAS THINKING AS ITINERANT MASTERS OFTEN MUST THINK THAT IT WAS VERY HARD TO HAVE TO BEAR SO MANY UNPLEASANT THINGS
THEN SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM ALLUDING TO THE FACT THAT IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO JOHN MORTON REGINALD HIMSELF WOULD BE THE SQUIRE OF BRAGTON REGINALD WHEN HE RECEIVED THIS AT ONCE WENT OVER TO THE ATTORNEY'S HOUSE
AH YES I DARE SAY THAT WAS THE NAME I HEARD UP THERE YOU ARE NOT MISTER TWENTYMAN SIR MY NAME IS MORTON
THE FOX CERTAINLY WENT ON TO LITTLETON SAID THE ELDER BOTSEY MY DEAR FELLOW SAID THE CAPTAIN I CAN TELL YOU WHERE THE FOX WENT QUITE AS WELL AS YOU CAN TELL ME DO ALLOW A MAN TO KNOW WHAT HE'S ABOUT SOME TIMES
OF COURSE HE MUST FURNISH THE PLACE AND HAVE AN IMMENSE DEAL DONE BEFORE HE CAN MARRY I THINK IT IS A PIECE OF IMPUDENCE TO BRING ONE TO SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAT'S NONSENSE MAMMA BECAUSE HE TOLD US ALL ABOUT IT
AND IT ISN'T GENERALLY THE CUSTOM TO HAVE FOX COVERTS POISONED SAID THE CAPTAIN ASSUMING TO HIMSELF THE CREDIT DUE TO TONY'S SAGACITY IF YOU WISH TO BE MASTER OF THESE HOUNDS I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST OBJECTION
AND MUCH BLOWING OF HORNS AND PRAYERS FROM CAPTAIN GLOMAX THAT GENTLEMEN WOULD ONLY BE SO GOOD AS TO HOLD THEIR TONGUES AND A FULL TONGUED VOLLEY OF ABUSE FROM HALF THE FIELD AGAINST AN UNFORTUNATE GENTLEMAN WHO RODE
THE MAJOR WAS SYMPATHETIC AND MADE HIS FRIEND'S HORSES AND TRIED THEM AND SOLD THEM THEN HE WOULD TAKE HIS TWO BOTTLES OF WINE OF COURSE FROM HIS FRIEND'S CELLAR AND WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE DAY'S SPORT WOULD BE ORACULAR
THEN THE THING WAS UNDERSTOOD AND CAPTAIN GLOMAX WAS ALLOWED TO CARRY OFF THE HOUNDS AND HIS ILL HUMOUR WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD BUT JUST AT THAT MOMENT WHILE THE HOUNDS AND THE MASTER AND LORD RUFFORD AND HIS FRIENDS WERE TURNING BACK IN THEIR OWN DIRECTION
HE PRODUCED A WITNESS THE MOUNTAIN LOUT WHOM HALE REMEMBERED WHO ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BLOWN THE WHISTLE GIVEN THE YELL AND FIRED THE PISTOL SHOT WHEN ASKED HIS REASON THE WITNESS WHO WAS STUPID HAD NONE READY LOOKED HELPLESSLY AT RUFE
SET ON LEAN DEAD BODIES AND THE CLUMP OF BIG CASTOR PLANTS BUFFETED BY THE WIND LEANED THIS WAY AND THAT LIKE GIANTS IN A DRUNKEN ORGY TRYING TO KEEP ONE ANOTHER FROM FALLING DOWN
WOULD FEEL AT THE OUTRAGE DONE HIM ANGER AGAINST THE TOWN THE GUARD AGAINST HALE BECAUSE HE WAS A PART OF BOTH AND EVEN AGAINST HER DAVE WAS MERELY DRUNK HE HAD SIMPLY SHOT OFF HIS PISTOL THAT WAS NO HARM IN THE HILLS
HE AIN'T COME BACK HYEH JES FER COAL SAID OLE HON SHUCKS SAID UNCLE BILLY YOU WOMEN FOLKS CAN'T THINK BOUT NOTHIN CEPT ONE THING HE'S TOO OLD FER HER
EVEN THE FACE OF THE GAP WAS A LITTLE CHANGED BY THE GRAY SCAR THAT MAN HAD SLASHED ACROSS ITS MOUTH GETTING LIMESTONE FOR THE GROANING MONSTER OF A FURNACE THAT WAS NOW AT PEACE THE STREETS WERE DESERTED A NEW FACE FRONTED HIM AT THE DESK OF THE HOTEL
SUDDENLY THE RED FOX COCKED HIS EAR LIKE A HOUND AND WITHOUT A WORD SLIPPED SWIFTLY WITHIN THE CABIN A MOMENT LATER HALE HEARD THE GALLOPING OF A HORSE AND FROM OUT THE DARK WOODS LOPED A HORSEMAN WITH A WINCHESTER ACROSS HIS SADDLE BOW
AND FINALLY MUMBLED FER FUN BUT IT WAS PLAIN FROM THE QUESTIONS THAT RUFE HAD PUT TO HALE ONLY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE SHOOTING AND FROM THE HESITATION OF THE WITNESS
YOU MUST BE KIN TO EVERYBODY AROUND HERE MOST EVERYBODY SHE SAID SIMPLY BY AND BY THEY CAME TO A CREEK
A SCULPTOR WOULD HAVE LOVED THE ROUNDED SLENDERNESS IN THE CURVING LONG LINES THAT SHAPED HER BROWN THROAT HER ARMS AND HER HANDS WHICH WERE PRETTILY SHAPED
AND A WILD ELATION SETTLED IN HER HEART THAT JOHN HALE WAS ALIVE AND UNHURT THOUGH RUFE WAS DEAD HER FATHER WOUNDED AND BUB AND DAVE BOTH HAD BUT NARROWLY ESCAPED THE FALIN ASSASSINS THAT AFTERNOON
HE KNEW THE WORD WAS MERELY A FAMILY CHARACTERISTIC OF OLD FASHIONED COURTESY ISN'T HE NICE JUNE YES SHE SAID HAVE YOU MISSED ME JUNE JUNE SLID HER HAND INTO HIS I'M SO GLAD YOU COME BACK
I RECKON YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I BE I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE AGAIN THE MOUNTAINEER STARED NO USE GITTIN MAD YOUNG FELLER HE SAID COOLLY I MISTAKEN YE FER SOMEBODY ELSE AN I AXE YER PARDON
IN EVERY DOORWAY STOOD A MAN CAUTIOUSLY LOOKING ON AND IN A HOTEL WINDOW HE SAW A WOMAN'S FRIGHTENED FACE IT WAS SO STILL THAT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT A TRAGEDY COULD BE IMMINENT AND YET WHILE HE WAS TRYING TO TAKE THE CONDITIONS IN ONE OF THE QUARRELLING MEN
ONLY JUNE DID NOT KNOW THE LIKE OF IT
SHE COULD NOT BE ALONE WHEN THE HOUR CAME AND SHE STARTED DOWN THE ROAD TOWARD UNCLE BILLY'S MILL HALE HALE HALE THE NAME BEGAN TO RING IN HER EARS LIKE A BELL
AND THEN THE TRAIN CRAWLED THROUGH A TOWERING BENCH OF ROCK THE MOUTH OF IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OPENED INTO A MIGHTY AMPHITHEATRE WITH SOLID ROCK WALLS SHOOTING VERTICALLY HUNDREDS OF FEET UPWARD
AND THEN HER LONG LASHES HID THEM CAUSE YOU WAS SO GOOD TO ME HALE CHOKED SUDDENLY AND PATTED HER ON THE SHOULDER GO IN NOW LITTLE GIRL AND STUDY THEN YOU MUST TAKE A WALK I'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO I'LL SEE YOU AT SUPPER TIME
AND LOOSENING HERSELF FROM LORETTA SHE RAN ROUND THE HORSE AND HAD BUB IN HER ARMS THEN SHE LOOKED UP INTO THE EYES OF HER STEP MOTHER THE OLD WOMAN'S FACE LOOKED KIND SO KIND
SHE WONDERED IF DAVE MIGHT NOT GET INTO A FIGHT OR PERHAPS HE WOULD GET SO DRUNK THAT HE WOULD GO TO SLEEP SOMEWHERE SHE KNEW THAT MEN DID THAT AFTER DRINKING VERY MUCH AND ANYHOW HE WOULD NOT BOTHER HER UNTIL NEXT MORNING
WITH HER BRONZE GOLD HAIR GATHERED UNDER IT IN THE SAME OLD PSYCHE KNOT SHE MUST WEAR HER SHOES SHE TOLD HALE UNTIL SHE GOT OUT OF TOWN ELSE SOMEONE MIGHT SEE HER BUT HALE HAD SAID SHE WOULD BE LEAVING TOO EARLY FOR THAT
WANT TO LAY DOWN ASKED THE OLD MAN QUICKLY I THINK I DO SAID HALE AND THEY WENT INSIDE
THE MOUNTAINEER'S BUSHY BROWS CAME TOGETHER ACROSS THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE AND HIS VOICE RUMBLED LIKE DISTANT THUNDER WHAT'S YO NAME STRANGER AN WHAT'S YO BUSINESS OVER HYEH DEAR ME THERE YOU GO YOU CAN SEE I'M FISHING
AND THERE WITH A GRIN ON HIS CURIOUS MISMATCHED FACE HE REPEATED YOUNG DAVE'S WORDS YOU'VE COME BACK AGIN
THE ORDER WAS NOT OBEYED AND HALE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND HIGH ABOVE JACK'S HEAD AND DROPPED THE BUTT OF HIS WEAPON ON JACK'S SKULL HARD JACK'S HEAD DROPPED BACK BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS HIS EYES CLOSED AND HIS PISTOL CLICKED ON THE FLOOR
BOUT THE BREAK O DAY HE WHIRLED HIS HORSE WITH AN OATH JUNE WAS GONE
BOB WHO HAD BEEN A YEAR IN A MILITARY SCHOOL WAS DRILL MASTER FOR THE RECRUITS AND VERY GRAVELY HE PERFORMED HIS DUTIES AND PUT THEM THROUGH THE SKIRMISHERS DRILL ADVANCING IN RUSHES THROWING THEMSELVES IN THE NEW GRASS
AND THEN SHE SAID IN A COMMANDING UNDERTONE GO ON BILLY
NO NOT IN THESE MOUNTAINS WHY THE FISHERMAN LOOKED AROUND AND WAS ALMOST STARTLED BY THE FIERCE GAZE OF HIS QUESTIONER STOP THAT PLEASE HE SAID WITH A HUMOUROUS SMILE YOU MAKE ME NERVOUS
AND TO THE SURPRISE OF EVERYBODY JACK QUIETLY PAID HIS FINE AND THEREAFTER THE GUARD HAD LITTLE ACTIVE TROUBLE FROM THE TOWN ITSELF FOR IT WAS QUITE PLAIN THERE AT LEAST THAT THE GUARD MEANT BUSINESS
I THOUGHT YE WAS GREAT FRIENDS THE LITTLE GIRL ROSE HASTILY
EXCEPT THAT HE ASKED GOD TO SAVE A COMMONWEALTH INSTEAD OF A KING AND THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY ROSE NEXT WITNESS MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOUR AND AS THE CLERK GOT TO HIS FEET WITH A SLIP OF PAPER IN HIS HAND AND BAWLED OUT A NAME
THEN HIS EYES LIGHTED UP MY BROTHERS DON'T SEEM TO WANT ME TO JOIN THE POLICE GUARD WON'T YOU SAY A WORD FOR ME I CERTAINLY WILL THANK YOU SIR THAT SIR NO LONGER BOTHERED HALE
STRAIGHTWAY HER FACE WAS A RAY OF SUNLIGHT WOULD I LIKE TO GO OVER SHE STOPPED SUDDENLY AND PULLED IN HER HORSE BUT HALE HAD HEARD NOTHING HELLO
AND THEN THE TWO PASSED INTO A GREEN GLOOM OF SHADOW AND THICK LEAVES THAT SHUT HER HEART IN AS SUDDENLY AS THOUGH SOME HUMAN HAND HAD CLUTCHED IT SHE WAS GOING HOME TO SEE BUB AND LORETTA AND UNCLE BILLY AND OLD HON
A MAN WITH A WOMAN BEHIND HIM BOTH OLD AND SPECTACLED ALL THREE MOTIONLESS ON THE BANK AND LOOKING AT HIM
ON ONE CORNER OF THE SQUARE HE COULD SEE THE CHIEF STORE OF THE TOWN MARKED BUCK FALIN GENERAL MERCHANDISE AND THE BIG MAN IN THE DOOR WITH THE BUSHY REDHEAD HE GUESSED WAS THE LEADER OF THE FALIN CLAN OUTSIDE THE DOOR STOOD A SMALLER REPLICA OF THE SAME FIGURE
DON'T YOU WORRY JACK ALL RIGHT SAM AN HOUR LATER HALE WAS AT THE LIVERY STABLE FOR A HORSE TO RIDE TO LONESOME COVE FOR HE HAD SOLD HIS BIG BLACK TO HELP OUT EXPENSES FOR THE TRIP TO ENGLAND OLD DAN HARRIS THE STABLEMAN
SHE SAID STILL NOT LOOKING AT HIM AND WITH A LITTLE MOVEMENT OF HER KNEES AWAY FROM HIM
HALE WATCHED HER WHILE SHE MUNCHED A STRIPED STICK OF PEPPERMINT HER CRIMSON BONNET HAD FALLEN FROM HER SUNLIT HAIR AND STRAIGHT DOWN FROM IT TO HER BARE LITTLE FOOT WITH ITS STUBBED TOE JUST DARKENING WITH DRIED BLOOD
ALL RIGHT JUNY THEY SHOT ME FROM THE LAUREL
TO THE FARTHEST LIMITS OF THE WORLD EVEN OUT THERE HALE HAD TOLD HER SHE WOULD GO SOME DAY THE LAST CURVING UP SWEEP CAME FINALLY AND THERE STOOD THE BIG PINE MAJESTIC UNCHANGED
LIKE GHOSTLY FIGURES IN A DREAM ONCE ONLY DID SHE OPEN HER LIPS AND THAT WAS TO PLEAD WITH HER FATHER TO LEAVE BUB AT HOME BUT HER FATHER GAVE HER NO ANSWER AND BUB SNORTED HIS INDIGNATION HE WAS A MAN NOW
YES SAID HALE IMPATIENTLY I'M GOING OVER TO LONESOME COVE CAN I STAY HERE ALL NIGHT SHORE SAID THE OLD MAN HOSPITABLY THAT'S A FINE HOSS YOU GOT THAR HE ADDED WITH A CHUCKLE BEEN SWAPPIN
FILLED AND LIGHTED IT SLOWLY AND TURNED HIS PERPLEXED EYES TO THE SUN WELL HONEY HE SAID AS THOUGH HE WERE DOING THE BEST HE COULD WITH A DIFFICULT SITUATION I'LL HAVE TO GIT YOU THAT MEAL AT THE HOUSE BOUT DINNER TIME NOW
WHICH WAS DEEP IN SEAT HIGH BOTH IN FRONT AND BEHIND AND HAD STRANGE LONG HOODED STIRRUPS STARTING TO MOUNT THE MAN STOPPED WITH ONE FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS HER SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE SHRANK BACK AGAIN
IS ALSO PROBABLY A MEMBER OF THE LEISURE CLASS ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE SMITH'S AGENT WHOSE NAME WE DO NOT KNOW HE SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE WORKING CLASS WHICH POWART DESPISES
HE HIMSELF DID NOT DO THE DRIVING FROM WHAT THE GEOLOGIST COULD SEE OF THE COUNTRY BELOW IT WAS QUITE CERTAINLY CULTIVATED IN NO OTHER WAY COULD THE EVEN ROWS AND UNIFORM GROWTH BE EXPLAINED
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO RETIRE GOOD LUCK ANOTHER YAWN AND GOOD HER VOICE CHANGED MISTER FORT SHARPLY POWART'S DECLARATION OF WAR ON ALMA
THE TWO MEN REACHED THE HILLS ON THEIR SIDE OF THE VALLEY AN HOUR BEFORE THE WOMEN REACHED THEIRS AND THUS THE SEARCH BEGAN THE STRANGEST SEARCH BEYOND A DOUBT WITHIN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE
AS HE BUTTONED THEM UP AROUND THE NECK HE STEPPED IN FRONT OF A GLASS SMITH WAS NEARLY FLOORED THE MAN WAS ALMOST HIS EXACT DOUBLE AN ORDINARY EVERYDAY SORT OF A CHAP WITH A VERY COMMONPLACE FACE
UNTIL I SAW SAW THAT HE STOPPED FLUSHING DEEPLY AND BEFORE HE COULD COLLECT HIMSELF SMITH HAD BROKEN IN AGAIN I JUST HAPPENED TO REMEMBER DOC
HAVE CARRIED THE PRINCIPLE OF IMPROVEMENT AS OPPOSED TO REFORM TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION
ALL NEWS CUT OFF THE MAN INSTANTLY SMELLED A MOUSE QUARANTINE WHY SHOULD THAT CAUSE THE NEWS TO BE CUT OFF THERE'S SOMETHING MORE THAN QUARANTINE THE MATTER REBLONG
IS NOT UNKNOWN TO CERTAIN FORMS OF EARTH'S INSECT LIFE I MEAN A SOLDIER TYPE A KIND OF BEE WHICH SPECIALIZES ON FIGHTING VAN EMMON WAS LISTENING CLOSELY
BLOW YE GREAT WIND MAKER AND I SHALL FEED THE FLOWER AND THUS IT CAME ABOUT THAT TWO MEN OF SANUS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE PLANET LOOKED UPON FIRE ITSELF AND WHEN THEY HAD GOT IT TO BURNING WELL EACH OF THEM STARED AT HIS HANDS
THIS DAUGHTER OF CAPELLA'S CAPELLETTE FROM BILLIE PROMPTLY FINE
WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THAT DISABLED AIRCRAFT WHICH SMITH SAW FELL SO VERY SLOWLY THE PLANET HAS MUCH MORE AIR THAN THE EARTH WHICH MEANS FAR GREATER DENSITY NEAR THE SURFACE
I NEVER THOUGHT A FULL GROWN MAN COULD CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE STUFF WE WERE TAUGHT WHEN WE WERE KIDS DON'T YOU EVER THINK FOR YOURSELF REBLONG WHY LOOK HERE HE CAME CLOSER AND SPOKE WITH PAINSTAKING CLEARNESS
SENT OUT A MESSAGE WHICH WAS READ AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS RECEIVED BY VAN EMMON'S AGENT AND AS UNCONSCIOUSLY TRANSLATED NUMBER EIGHT HUNDRED FOUR YOU ARE WANTED ON PLOT SEVENTEEN WHEREUPON
AND NOW THEY KEPT A SHARP LOOKOUT AT EVERY STEP VAN EMMON AND SMITH HAD SIMILARLY IMPRESSED CORRUS AND DULNOP WITH THE RESULT THAT THERE WAS NO LOSS OF TIME IN THE BEGINNING
ALMOST PERFECT IMITATION OF A BEE IT WAS VERY CLOSE TO AN EXACT REPRODUCTION FOR ONE EXCEPTION IT DID NOT HAVE THE HAIRY APPEARANCE SO CHARACTERISTIC OF BEES
IT BE NO DREAM HE DECLARED STILL AWESTRUCK NAY AGREED DULNOP AND NOW TO MAKE THE FLOWER GROW IT WAS CORRUS'S LUNGS WHICH REALLY DID THE WORK
AND FROM THE LIGHT IN FORT'S EYES VAN EMMON KNEW THAT THE CHIEF WAS SORELY PROVOKED HOWEVER HE SPOKE WITH HIS USUAL COOLNESS AND CERTAINTY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU WILL BE EXEMPT MISTER FORT
IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY INGENIOUS THING WITH LITTLE OR NO PLOT AFTERWARD SMITH COULD NOT DESCRIBE IT WITH ANY ACCURACY HOWEVER MISSUS KINNEY DOWN STAIRS PLAINLY HEARD HIM LAUGHING AS THOUGH HIS SIDES WOULD GIVE WAY
FROM THE CONSCRIPTION WHICH IS NOW UNDER WAY I SHALL DO NOTHING THAT MIGHT HINDER YOUR ACTIVITIES IN ANY WAY I TAKE IT EVENLY THAT YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING BIG FORT BOWED
THE HUMANS SEEM TO DO ALL THE WORK AND THE BEES THE BOSSING THE DOCTOR EXPECTED THIS THE VENUSIANS HAD OUR VIEWPOINT
THE PICTURE OVER SMITH'S MAN GOT UP AND LEFT THE PLACE AND ONCE OUTSIDE HE GLANCED AT HIS WATCH AND TOOK UP A POSITION ON THE CURB MUCH AS SMITH HAD OFTEN DONE WHEN A YOUNGER MAN THE CAPELLAN SEEMED TO KNOW A GOOD MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT OF THE PLAYHOUSE
VAN EMMON NOTICED THAT THEY SHOOK HANDS ALMOST EXACTLY AS AMERICANS WOULD
OF HUMAN OCCUPANCY ALL ARGUED THAT THE TWO MEN HAD HIT UPON THE SAME TYPE OF AGENT IN VAN EMMON'S CASE HOWEVER HE COULD OCCASIONALLY GLIMPSE TWO LOOSE PARTS OF THE MACHINE
EVERY LAST ONE OF US OUGHT TO BE GIVEN A COLLEGE EDUCATION INSTEAD OF MERELY THE CHILDREN OF THE RICH AND ALL THIS COULD BE DONE TOO THERE'S NO EARTHLY REASON WHY WE SHOULD PERMIT THAT BUNCH OF PARASITES IN HAFEN TO GRAFT OFF US ANY LONGER
JUST SUCH STARS AS SHALL AWAKEN THE SEED OF THE FLOWER YE SHALL SEE BOTH KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO LOOK FOR THE BRASSY REGULARLY CUT CRYSTALS WITH THE BLACK STRIPINGS SUCH AS HAS LED COUNTLESS MEN TO GO THROUGH UNTOLD HARDSHIPS IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY HAD FOUND GOLD
MOWNOTH HE EXCLAIMED HIS EYES RAISED FERVENTLY IF IT BE THY WILL TO DELIVER US GIVE US THE SECRET THIS NIGHT MEANWHILE IN ROLLA'S HUT A SIMILAR SCENE WAS GOING ON UNDER THE DOCTOR'S PROJECTED EYE
DO YOU LOVE ME WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY ME MONA SHE PRETENDED TO BE VERY BUSY WITH THE DRIVING SO THAT BILLIE NEVER KNEW WHETHER FORT LOOKED ANXIOUS OR NOT PRESENTLY MONA SAID I THINK
TWENTY FIVE HOUR DIAL AND A PENDULUM OF THE USUAL LENGTH SAME AS YOURS
WAS SIMPLY SPRINKLED WITH GOLD GOLD GOLD EVERYWHERE LARGE NUGGETS OF IT AS BIG AS ONE'S FIST NOT EMBEDDED IN ROCK
IT WILL BE BETTER APPRECIATED WHEN THE MEN'S CHILDISH NATURE IS BORNE IN MIND THEIR PATIENCE WAS TERRIBLY STRAINED IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO MAKE THE SPARKS FLY INTO THE TINDER AGAIN AND AGAIN ONE OF THEM WOULD THROW THE ROCKS ANGRILY TO THE GROUND
NEXT SECOND CAME THE EARTHQUAKE THE WHOLE STATUE ROCKED AND SWAYED VAN EMMON LOOKED TO SEE THE MACHINE THROWN OFF FROM THE BASE OF THE MONUMENT CAME A SINGLE TERRIFIC SOUND
HE HEARD THE HISS AND WHINE WHICH SEEMED TO INDICATE THE SUCTION DEVICE IT WAS A WHOLE LOT LIKE GOING DOWN INTO A PLACER MINE THE GEOLOGIST AFTERWARD SAID AND IN VIEW OF WHAT NEXT MET HIS EYES
WHICH ENABLED HIM TO FORCE HIS WILL UPON OTHER CREATURES THIS POWER WAS HIS POISONOUS STING HE FOUND THAT WHEN HE GOT HIS FELLOWS TOGETHER AND FORMED A SWARM
VAN EMMON'S AGENT TURNED HIS MYSTERIOUS PERISCOPE SO AS TO TAKE IT ALL IN AND THE GEOLOGIST WAS ABLE TO WATCH HIS FILL WHEREUPON HE BECAME CONVERTED TO A NEW IDEA
THE NATURAL RESULT OF A COMMON ENTHUSIASM FOR THEIR SIDE WON BUT FORT WAS CONTENT FOR A WHILE TO MERELY WATCH MONA WHO WAS DRIVING
THE NATURAL COLORING AND STEREOSCOPIC EFFECT THAT THE DOCTOR HAD ALREADY NOTED THROUGH YOUNG ERNOL SMITH NEARLY OVERLOOKED THE REALLY FINE MUSIC ALL COMING FROM A TALKING MACHINE OF SOME KIND AND THEN THE PICTURE CAME TO AN END AND A FARCE COMEDY BEGAN
VAN EMMON'S UNKNOWN ASSISTANT REPLIED AT ONCE VERY WELL SUPERIOR IT WAS DONE BY MEANS OF AN EXTREMELY FAINT HUMMING DEVICE REMINDING THE GEOLOGIST OF CERTAIN WIRELESS APPARATA HE HAD HEARD
ORIGINALLY THE HUMAN WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE APES HE ASSOCIATED WITH THERE WAS PERHAPS ONLY ONE SLIGHT POINT OF SUPERIORITY TODAY THERE ARE MILLIONS OF SUCH POINTS MAN IS
BUT THAT REMARK SHE MADE ABOUT PEOPLE BEING CATTLE
IT WAS OF COURSE THE COBULUS AND IT WAS WHEN SMITH'S AGENT PASSED THROUGH A CHECKING IN ROOM THAT HIS NAME WAS HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME
MOREOVER CONDITIONS ARE NO BETTER THAN THEY WERE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THERE'S BEEN NO PROGRESS POWART ADMITS THAT NOW PLACING THAT FACT ALONGSIDE THE REST I REACH
I RATHER THINK I LIKE YOU TOO WELL TO MARRY YOU WHAT I MEAN IS I'M AFRAID IT WOULD SPOIL YOU MY DEAR BOY YOU'RE TOO WELL SATISFIED WITH YOURSELF I DON'T WANT TO MARRY A MAN WHO IS CONTENT TO FLY AROUND HALF THE TIME
AN EDUCATED WORKMAN IS A BETTER DIVIDEND PRODUCER THAN AN IGNORANT ONE THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT REBLONG DON'T FOOL YOURSELF INTO THINKING THAT THE COMMISSION HAS DONE ALL THIS FOR YOUR BENEFIT NOT MUCH MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT CONCEDED REBLONG
NO BUT HE POINTS OUT THAT OUR PRESENT STANDARD OF LIVING HAS NOT CHANGED FOR GENERATIONS AND ARGUES THAT DEGENERATION MUST RESULT OF COURSE HE IS RIGHT IN HIS FACT BUT WRONG IN HIS CONCLUSION
SUCH THINGS GIVE A COMPLETENESS TO PROSPERITY AND CONTRIBUTE ELEMENTS OF AGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ARE NOT DREAMED OF BY THAT SHORT SIGHTED OVERHEATED VINDICTIVENESS WHICH GOES OUT ITS WAY TO WREAK ITSELF IN DIRECT INJURY
AND PAY HER MUCH RESPECT ON ACCOUNT OF HER SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE SHE HAD ONCE MENTIONED HER VIEWS ON THIS POINT TO TOM AND SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD STAIN HIS FACE BROWN AND THEY SHOULD RUN AWAY TOGETHER BUT TOM REJECTED THE SCHEME WITH CONTEMPT
BUT YOU'VE DONE WHAT YOU COULD TO MAKE THINGS A BIT EVEN SHAKE HANDS WI ME AGAIN MY LAD BEFORE I GO AWAY FROM YOU THE FATHER AND SON CLASPED HANDS
AND STEPHEN WAS HURRYING HER ALONG ON HIS ARM THAT SOME ONE HAD ADVANCED TOWARD HER FROM THAT CLUSTER AS IF HE WERE COMING TO SPEAK TO HER BUT SHE WAS HURRIED ALONG AND WAS INDIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING BUT THE COMING TRIAL A PORTER GUIDED THEM TO THE NEAREST INN AND POSTING HOUSE
BUT SHE DID NOT LEARN THAT UNTIL SHE WAS SET DOWN IN THE OLD CITY AT MIDNIGHT IT WAS NO MATTER SHE COULD SLEEP THERE AND START HOME THE NEXT DAY SHE HAD HER PURSE IN HER POCKET WITH ALL HER MONEY IN IT A BANK NOTE AND A SOVEREIGN
IT WAS A CLEAR FROSTY JANUARY DAY ON WHICH MISTER TULLIVER FIRST CAME DOWNSTAIRS THE BRIGHT SUN ON THE CHESTNUT BOUGHS AND THE ROOFS OPPOSITE HIS WINDOW HAD MADE HIM IMPATIENTLY DECLARE THAT HE WOULD BE CAGED UP NO LONGER HE THOUGHT EVERYWHERE WOULD BE MORE CHEERY UNDER THIS SUNSHINE THAN HIS BEDROOM
SO SHE WOULD WALK WITH TOM TO SAINT OGG'S THAT MORNING AND WHEN TOM URGED THAT SHE MIGHT LET THE PICKLES BE AT PRESENT HE DIDN'T LIKE HER TO GO ABOUT JUST YET SHE APPEARED SO HURT AT THIS CONDUCT IN HER SON CONTRADICTING HER ABOUT PICKLES WHICH SHE HAD MADE AFTER THE FAMILY RECEIPTS INHERITED FROM HIS OWN GRANDMOTHER
IS ADVANTAGEOUSLY SITUATED WHEN HE IS ROWING THEM IN A BOAT WHAT THEN HAD HE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS SURPRISING DAUGHTER OF MISSUS TULLIVER AT FIRST SIGHT CERTAINLY NOT SUCH PASSIONS ARE NEVER HEARD OF IN REAL LIFE BESIDES
YOU MUST EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU MISSUS TULLIVER I HAVE BUSINESS THAT MUST BE ATTENDED TO AND I THINK THERE IS NOTHING MORE NECESSARY TO BE SAID BUT IF YOU WOULD BEAR IT IN MIND SIR SAID MISSUS TULLIVER RISING AND NOT RUN AGAINST ME AND MY CHILDREN AND I'M NOT DENYING MISTER TULLIVER'S BEEN IN THE WRONG
DON'T YOU TAKE ON TOO MUCH BOUT IT SIR SAID LUKE YOU'D HA PAID IVERYBODY IF YOU COULD THAT'S WHAT I SAID TO MASTER TOM
THE SUCCESSFUL YELLOW CANDIDATE FOR THE BOROUGH OF OLD TOPPING PERHAPS FEELS NO PURSUANT MEDITATIVE HATRED TOWARD THE BLUE EDITOR WHO CONSOLES HIS SUBSCRIBERS WITH VITUPERATIVE RHETORIC AGAINST YELLOW MEN WHO SELL THEIR COUNTRY AND ARE THE DEMONS OF PRIVATE LIFE BUT HE MIGHT NOT BE SORRY IF LAW AND OPPORTUNITY FAVORED
THIS WORLD'S BEEN TOO MANY FOR ME IT'S TOOK FOUR YEAR TO LAY THIS BY IT'S MUCH IF I'M ABOVE GROUND FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEAR I MUST TRUSTEN TO YOU TO PAY EM HE WENT ON WITH A TREMBLING VOICE
HE HAS SET THE DISSENTERS AND THE CHURCH PEOPLE BY THE EARS AND A RISING SENATOR LIKE MYSELF OF WHOSE SERVICES THE COUNTRY IS VERY MUCH IN NEED
WITH EVER UNRELENTING UNRELENTING PURPOSE STILL HIDES THAT SECRET IN HIS OWN MIGHTY SLOW BEATING HEART AND YET THIS CHRISTMAS DAY IN SPITE OF TOM'S FRESH DELIGHT IN HOME WAS NOT HE THOUGHT SOMEHOW OR OTHER
IT WAS WELL THAT THERE WAS THIS INTEREST OF NARRATIVE TO KEEP UNDER THE VAGUE BUT FIERCE SENSE OF TRIUMPH OVER WAKEM WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CHANNEL HIS JOY WOULD HAVE RUSHED INTO WITH DANGEROUS FORCE EVEN AS IT WAS
I COULDN'T LIVE IN PEACE IF I PUT THE SHADOW OF A WILFUL SIN BETWEEN MYSELF AND GOD I HAVE CAUSED SORROW ALREADY I KNOW I FEEL IT BUT I HAVE NEVER DELIBERATELY CONSENTED TO IT I HAVE NEVER SAID THEY SHALL SUFFER THAT I MAY HAVE JOY
BY LOOKING AT HIM DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF AN HOUR HER EYES WERE TOO FULL OF THE OLD BANKS THAT SHE KNEW SO WELL SHE FELT LONELY CUT OFF FROM PHILIP THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAD EVER SEEMED TO LOVE HER DEVOTEDLY
IT IS TOO LATE TO SAY WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE DONE OR WHAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE ADMITTING THE VERY WORST VIEW OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IT IS A FACT WE MUST ACT ON NOW OUR POSITION IS ALTERED THE RIGHT COURSE IS NO LONGER WHAT IT WAS BEFORE
BUT PRESENTLY THE RHYTHMIC MOVEMENT OF THE OARS ATTRACTED HER
NEXT FRIDAY IS THE DAY FRIDAY AT SIX O'CLOCK OH JUST RUN TO WINSHIP'S THE AUCTIONEER AND SEE IF HE'S AT HOME I HAVE SOME BUSINESS FOR HIM ASK HIM TO COME UP
SHE HAD KEPT IT IN HER POCKET FROM FORGETFULNESS AFTER GOING OUT TO MAKE PURCHASES THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
BUT I THRASHED ALL THE FELLOWS AT JACOB'S THAT'S WHERE I WAS BEFORE I CAME HERE AND I BEAT EM ALL AT BANDY AND CLIMBING AND I WISH MISTER STELLING WOULD LET US GO FISHING I COULD SHOW YOU HOW TO FISH YOU COULD FISH COULDN'T YOU
BY DETERMINING THAT SHE WOULD SECRETLY SEND HIM A LETTER BY A SMALL GYPSY WHO WOULD RUN AWAY WITHOUT TELLING WHERE SHE WAS AND JUST LET HIM KNOW THAT SHE WAS WELL AND HAPPY AND ALWAYS LOVED HIM VERY MUCH
AND BEYOND THE SILVERY BREADTH OF THE DEAR OLD FLOSS THAT AT THIS DISTANCE SEEMED TO BE SLEEPING IN A MORNING HOLIDAY THE SWEET FRESH GARDEN SCENT CAME THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW AND THE BIRDS WERE BUSY FLITTING AND ALIGHTING
ONE OF THEM CARRYING A BUNDLE ON A STICK OVER HIS SHOULDER BUT TO HER SURPRISE WHILE SHE WAS DREADING THEIR DISAPPROBATION AS A RUNAWAY THE MAN WITH THE BUNDLE STOPPED AND IN A HALF WHINING HALF COAXING TONE
YOU WON'T LIKE ME TO GO TO SCHOOL WITH WAKEM'S SON SHALL YOU IT'S NO MATTER FOR THAT MY BOY SAID MISTER TULLIVER DON'T YOU LEARN ANYTHING BAD OF HIM THAT'S ALL THE LAD'S A POOR DEFORMED CREATUR AND TAKES AFTER HIS MOTHER IN THE FACE
SAID MAGGIE TRYING TO ARREST THE PRATTLING STREAM AH THERE IS THE DOOR BELL THAT MUST BE STEPHEN LUCY WENT ON NOT NOTICING MAGGIE'S FAINT EFFORT TO SPEAK ONE OF THE THINGS I MOST ADMIRE IN STEPHEN IS THAT HE MAKES A GREATER FRIEND OF PHILIP THAN ANY ONE
HE SAID IN HIS DEEPEST TENDEREST TONE LEANING TOWARD HER AND PUTTING HIS ARM ROUND HER YOU ARE MINE NOW THE WORLD BELIEVES IT DUTY MUST SPRING OUT OF THAT NOW IN A FEW HOURS YOU WILL BE LEGALLY MINE AND THOSE WHO HAD CLAIMS ON US WILL SUBMIT
OH NEVER MIND THAT AUNT SEND US THE DRESS SAID LUCY I DON'T MEAN MAGGIE TO HAVE LONG SLEEVES
AND ULYSSES A LITTLE FELLOW BUT VERY WISE AND CUNNING GOT A RED HOT PINE TREE AND STUCK IT INTO THIS ONE EYE AND MADE HIM ROAR LIKE A THOUSAND BULLS OH WHAT FUN SAID TOM
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE IN A GOOD FOR YOU THAT I FEEL THAT WE BOTH FEEL IS A WRONG TOWARD OTHERS WE CAN'T CHOOSE HAPPINESS EITHER FOR OURSELVES OR FOR ANOTHER WE CAN'T TELL WHERE THAT WILL LIE WE CAN ONLY CHOOSE WHETHER WE WILL INDULGE OURSELVES IN THE PRESENT MOMENT
BUT IT CAME UPON HIM NOW WITH ENTIRE NOVELTY YES FATHER SAID TOM IN ANSWER TO THE GAZE YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOUR MIND ABOUT BUSINESS UNTIL YOU ARE QUITE WELL EVERYTHING IS SETTLED ABOUT THAT FOR THE PRESENT ABOUT THE MILL AND THE LAND AND THE DEBTS WHAT'S SETTLED THEN SAID HIS FATHER ANGRILY
HIS HANDS MOVED UNEASILY AS IF HE WANTED THEM TO REMOVE SOME OBSTRUCTION THAT WEIGHED UPON HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES THERE FELL FROM HIM SOME BROKEN WORDS THIS WORLD'S TOO MANY HONEST MAN PUZZLING
AND AT THE TIME MISSUS TULLIVER HAD HEARD OF THAT MARRIAGE THE SUMMER WHEN SHE WORE HER BLUE SATIN SPENCER AND HAD NOT YET ANY THOUGHTS OF MISTER TULLIVER SHE KNEW NO HARM OF WAKEM AND CERTAINLY TOWARD HERSELF WHOM HE KNEW TO HAVE BEEN A MISS DODSON IT WAS OUT OF ALL POSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD ENTERTAIN ANYTHING BUT GOOD WILL
TOM SHE SAID WHEN THEY WERE OUT OF THEIR FATHER'S ROOM TOGETHER WE MUST TRY TO MAKE FATHER UNDERSTAND A LITTLE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE HE GOES DOWNSTAIRS BUT WE MUST GET MY MOTHER AWAY SHE WILL SAY SOMETHING THAT WILL DO HARM
THE SLANTING SUNLIGHT FELL KINDLY UPON THEM AND THE SCENE WAS REALLY VERY PRETTY AND COMFORTABLE MAGGIE THOUGHT ONLY SHE HOPED THEY WOULD SOON SET OUT THE TEA CUPS EVERYTHING WOULD BE QUITE CHARMING
WHEN THEY REACHED HOME AGAIN THEY FOUND UNCLE AND AUNT PULLET SEATED WITH MISSUS TULLIVER IN THE DRAWING ROOM AND STEPHEN HURRIED AWAY ASKING LEAVE TO COME AGAIN IN THE EVENING AND PRAY BRING WITH YOU THE VOLUME OF PURCELL THAT YOU TOOK AWAY SAID LUCY
AND RUBBED HIS LARGE WHITE HANDS OVER HIS HAIR WITH PLAYFUL SELF ADMIRATION
I SHALL NOT TELL YOU WHAT IT IS THOUGH LUCY ROSE FROM HER KNEES AND WENT TO A LITTLE DISTANCE HOLDING HER PRETTY HEAD ON ONE SIDE AS IF SHE HAD BEEN ARRANGING MAGGIE FOR A PORTRAIT AND WISHED TO JUDGE OF THE GENERAL EFFECT STAND UP A MOMENT MAGGIE
HE LOOKED AWAY FROM THEM ALL WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS AND LAY SILENT FOR SOME MINUTES
AND GET A BREATH OF FRESH AIR BY DOING THAT NEEDFUL PIECE OF WORK POOR MISSUS TULLIVER WENT SUBMISSIVELY DOWNSTAIRS TO BE ORDERED ABOUT BY A SERVANT WAS THE LAST REMNANT OF HER HOUSEHOLD DIGNITIES SHE WOULD SOON HAVE NO SERVANT TO SCOLD HER
AND FIND SHE WAS A CHILD AGAIN IN THE PARLOR AT EVENING TWILIGHT AND TOM WAS NOT REALLY ANGRY FROM THE SOOTHED SENSE OF THAT FALSE WAKING SHE PASSED TO THE REAL WAKING TO THE PLASH OF WATER AGAINST THE VESSEL AND THE SOUND OF A FOOTSTEP ON THE DECK
DIX HASN'T BEEN CHOKING YOU UP AGAIN EH NO SIR IT'S ALL RIGHT AY I THOUGHT NOT HE WON'T BE IN A HURRY AT THAT AGAIN NOW RILEY'S BEEN TO SETTLE HIM THAT WAS WHAT I SAID TO RILEY YESTERDAY I SAID
SO MUCH AS THE MERE THOUGHT OF WAKEM CONTINUALLY FRESHENED BY THE SIGHT OF THE TOO ABLE ATTORNEY ON MARKET DAYS
ONE OF THESE A HURON SUDDENLY FELL IN WITH A LARGE IROQUOIS WAR PARTY AND SEEING THAT HE COULD NOT ESCAPE FORMED ON THE INSTANT A VILLANOUS PLAN TO SAVE HIMSELF HE RAN TOWARDS THE ENEMY CRYING OUT
OR FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET IN SHAPE THEY WERE MUCH LIKE AN ARBOR OVERARCHING A GARDEN WALK THEIR FRAME WAS OF TALL AND STRONG SAPLINGS PLANTED IN A DOUBLE ROW TO FORM THE TWO SIDES OF THE HOUSE
THE FRENCH ROWED AFTER THEM AND SOON BECAME SEPARATED IN THE CHASE WHEREUPON THE IROQUOIS TURNED AND MADE DESPERATE FIGHT WITH THE FOREMOST RETREATING AGAIN AS SOON AS THE OTHERS CAME UP
NEW BRUNSWICK NOVA SCOTIA AND LOWER CANADA WERE OCCUPIED SO FAR AS OCCUPIED AT ALL BY TRIBES SPEAKING VARIOUS ALGONQUIN LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS THEY EXTENDED MOREOVER ALONG THE SHORES OF THE UPPER LAKES
OR INDIAN LORETTE IT WAS A WILD SPOT COVERED WITH THE PRIMITIVE FOREST AND SEAMED BY A DEEP AND TORTUOUS RAVINE WHERE THE SAINT CHARLES FOAMS
THAT THEY COULD NOT ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS OF A WANDERING LIFE WHICH WAS NEW TO THEM THE HURONS LIVED BY AGRICULTURE THEIR FIELDS AND CROPS WERE DESTROYED AND THEY WERE SO HUNTED FROM PLACE TO PLACE THAT THEY COULD RARELY TILL THE SOIL
AN OPENING A FOOT WIDE WAS LEFT FOR THE ADMISSION OF LIGHT AND THE ESCAPE OF SMOKE AT EACH END WAS A CLOSE PORCH OF SIMILAR CONSTRUCTION
OR PROWLING WARRIOR WE HAVE SAID THAT THIS GROUP OF TRIBES WAS RELATIVELY VERY POPULOUS YET IT IS MORE THAN DOUBTFUL WHETHER ALL OF THEM UNITED HAD UNION BEEN POSSIBLE COULD HAVE MUSTERED EIGHT THOUSAND FIGHTING MEN TO SPEAK FURTHER OF THEM IS NEEDLESS
TO MORROW ALL AGAIN WAS SOLITUDE AND THE OTTAWA WAS COVERED WITH THE CANOES OF THE RETURNING WARRIORS ALONG THIS STREAM A MAIN ROUTE OF TRAFFIC THE SILENCE OF THE WILDERNESS WAS BROKEN ONLY BY THE SPLASH OF THE PASSING PADDLE
BETWEEN COVERS OF BEGRIMED PARCHMENT THE DAILY LIFE OF THIS RUINED COMMUNITY ITS FIRESIDES ITS FESTIVALS ITS FUNERAL RITES ARE PAINTED WITH A MINUTE AND VIVID FIDELITY
THE ANCIENT COUNTRY OF THE HURONS IS NOW THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN PORTION OF SIMCOE COUNTY CANADA WEST AND IS EMBRACED WITHIN THE PENINSULA FORMED BY THE NOTTAWASSAGA AND MATCHEDASH BAYS OF LAKE HURON
HAD NO TENANTS BUT HUNTERS NORTHWARD BETWEEN THE SAINT LAWRENCE AND HUDSON'S BAY ROAMED THE SCATTERED HORDES OF THE PAPINACHOIS BERSIAMITES AND OTHERS INCLUDED BY THE FRENCH UNDER THE GENERAL NAME
HAD DISAPPEARED AT THE OPENING OF THE NEXT CENTURY AND ANOTHER RACE HAD SUCCEEDED IN LANGUAGE AND CUSTOMS WIDELY DIFFERENT WHILE IN THE REGION NOW FORMING THE STATE OF NEW YORK A POWER WAS RISING TO A FEROCIOUS VITALITY WHICH
POPULATIONS FORMED IN THE IDEAS AND HABITS OF A FEUDAL MONARCHY AND CONTROLLED BY A HIERARCHY PROFOUNDLY HOSTILE TO FREEDOM OF THOUGHT WOULD HAVE REMAINED A HINDRANCE AND A STUMBLING BLOCK IN THE WAY OF THAT MAJESTIC EXPERIMENT
AND ANOTHER HURON TOWN SPRANG UP AND HERE TO THIS DAY THE TOURIST FINDS THE REMNANT OF A LOST PEOPLE HARMLESS WEAVERS OF BASKETS AND SEWERS OF MOCCASINS
OTHER PARTIES MORE FORTUNATE GAINED THE SHORE SAFELY AND BEGAN THEIR FISHING
THE FIRES WERE ON THE GROUND IN A LINE DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE EACH SUFFICED FOR TWO FAMILIES WHO IN WINTER SLEPT CLOSELY PACKED AROUND THEM
BUT HE REPLIED THAT THERE WERE OLDER AND WISER MEN AMONG THE HURONS WHOSE COUNSELS ALL THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED AND THAT THEY OUGHT TO LAY THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THEM HE PROCEEDED TO ADVISE THEM TO KEEP HIM AS A HOSTAGE AND SEND OVER HIS COMPANIONS WITH SOME OF THEIR CHIEFS
WITH A CHAPEL AND A SMALL HOUSE FOR THE MISSIONARIES
TO ONE OR MORE OLD MEN OF THE NATION WAS ASSIGNED THE HONORABLE BUT VERY ONEROUS CHARGE OF KEEPERS OF THE WAMPUM IN OTHER WORDS OF THE NATIONAL RECORDS AND IT WAS FOR THEM TO REMEMBER AND INTERPRET THE MEANING OF THE BELTS
LIKE THE SEATS OF A COLOSSAL OMNIBUS OFTEN ESPECIALLY AMONG THE IROQUOIS THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENT WAS DIFFERENT THE SCAFFOLDS OR PLATFORMS WERE RAISED ONLY A FOOT FROM THE EARTHEN FLOOR AND WERE ONLY TWELVE OR THIRTEEN FEET LONG
THE HURONS HAD HOWEVER IN COMMON WITH OTHER TRIBES A SYSTEM OF RUDE PICTURES AND ARBITRARY SIGNS BY WHICH THEY COULD CONVEY TO EACH OTHER WITH TOLERABLE PRECISION INFORMATION TOUCHING THE ORDINARY SUBJECTS OF INDIAN INTEREST
GAME WAS EXCEEDINGLY SCARCE AND THEY WERE FORCED BY HUNGER TO SEPARATE A HURON CONVERT AND A FRENCHMAN NAMED FONTARABIE REMAINING WITH THE MISSIONARY THE SNOWS HAD MELTED AND ALL THE STREAMS WERE SWOLLEN
ENGRAVINGS OF MANY SPECIMENS OF THESE FIGURED SONGS ARE GIVEN IN THE VOLUMINOUS REPORTS ON THE CONDITION OF THE INDIANS PUBLISHED BY GOVERNMENT UNDER THE EDITORSHIP OF MISTER SCHOOLCRAFT THE SPECIMENS ARE CHIEFLY ALGONQUIN
TO OPEN THE NEGOTIATION HIS APPARENT FRANKNESS COMPLETELY DECEIVED THEM AND THEY INSISTED THAT HE HIMSELF SHOULD GO TO THE HURON VILLAGE WHILE HIS COMPANIONS REMAINED AS HOSTAGES HE SET OUT ACCORDINGLY WITH THREE OF THE PRINCIPAL IROQUOIS
CANOES WERE MADE READY AND ON THE TENTH OF JUNE THEY BEGAN THE VOYAGE WITH ALL THEIR FRENCH FOLLOWERS AND ABOUT THREE HUNDRED HURONS THE HURON MISSION WAS ABANDONED
MIGRATED IN A BODY TO THE SENECA COUNTRY THEY WERE NOT DISTRIBUTED AMONG DIFFERENT VILLAGES BUT WERE ALLOWED TO FORM A TOWN BY THEMSELVES
TO THE MEN FELL THE TASK OF BUILDING THE HOUSES AND MAKING WEAPONS PIPES AND CANOES FOR THE REST THEIR HOME LIFE WAS A LIFE OF LEISURE AND AMUSEMENT
COME AND EAT AND TO REFUSE WAS A GRAVE OFFENCE
IT WAS BUILT OF BRICK LIKE ITS ORIGINAL OF WHICH IT WAS AN EXACT FACSIMILE AND IT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF A QUADRANGLE THE FOUR SIDES OF WHICH WERE FORMED BY THE BARK DWELLINGS OF THE HURONS RANGED WITH PERFECT ORDER IN STRAIGHT LINES
HUNTING FOR SUBSISTENCE AND WAITING TO WAYLAY SOME PASSING CANOE OF HURONS ALGONQUINS OR FRENCHMEN BRESSANI'S PARTY OUTNUMBERED THEM SIX TO ONE BUT THEY RESOLVED THAT IT SHOULD NOT PASS WITHOUT A TOKEN OF THEIR PRESENCE
FELL UPON ONE OF THEIR CAMPS IN THE WINTER AND MADE A GENERAL BUTCHERY OF THE INMATES THE TRIBE HOWEVER STILL HELD ITS GROUND FOR A TIME AND BEING ALL GOOD CATHOLICS GAVE THEIR MISSIONARY FATHER BUTEUX
AND MADE THEM A PREY TO MISERY TORTURE AND A CRUEL DEATH IN A WORD THEY ARE A PEOPLE SWEPT FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH OUR ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT AS THEY DIED CHRISTIANS
THE ART SOON FELL INTO DISUSE HOWEVER FOR WAMPUM BETTER THAN THEIR OWN WAS BROUGHT THEM BY THE TRADERS BESIDES ABUNDANT IMITATIONS IN GLASS AND PORCELAIN STRUNG INTO NECKLACES OR WROUGHT INTO COLLARS BELTS AND BRACELETS
LATE ON A DARK NIGHT THE FRENCH AND HURONS LAY ENCAMPED IN THE FOREST SLEEPING ABOUT THEIR FIRES THEY HAD SET GUARDS BUT THESE IT SEEMS WERE DROWSY OR NEGLIGENT FOR THE TEN IROQUOIS WATCHING THEIR TIME APPROACHED WITH THE STEALTH OF LYNXES
WERE A GREAT NUMBER OF POLES LIKE THE PERCHES OF A HEN ROOST AND HERE WERE SUSPENDED WEAPONS CLOTHING SKINS AND ORNAMENTS HERE TOO IN HARVEST TIME THE SQUAWS HUNG THE EARS OF UNSHELLED CORN
HAD BEEN DRIVEN BY FEAR OF THE IROQUOIS FROM THE WESTERN SHORES OF LAKE HURON AND THE BANKS OF THE RIVER OTTAWA AT MICHILIMACKINAC THE HURONS AND THEIR ALLIES WERE AGAIN ATTACKED BY THE IROQUOIS
BUTEUX AND THE FRENCHMAN TRIED TO ESCAPE BUT WERE INSTANTLY SHOT DOWN THE JESUIT RECEIVING TWO BALLS IN THE BREAST THE IROQUOIS RUSHED UPON THEM MANGLED THEIR BODIES WITH TOMAHAWKS AND SWORDS STRIPPED THEM
AND HERE DURING SUMMER THEY SLEPT PELLMELL IN THE CLOTHES THEY WORE BY DAY AND WITHOUT PILLOWS THESE WERE FORMED OF THICK SHEETS OF BARK SUPPORTED BY POSTS AND TRANSVERSE POLES AND COVERED WITH MATS AND SKINS
NOT BY A DEPLETED ANTAGONIST STILL FEEBLE FROM THE EXHAUSTION OF A STARVED AND PERSECUTED INFANCY BUT BY AN ATHLETIC CHAMPION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF RICHELIEU AND OF LOYOLA LIBERTY MAY THANK THE IROQUOIS THAT BY THEIR INSENSATE FURY
AND A LEAGUE OR TWO BELOW THERE WAS ANOTHER SIMILAR FORT THE RIVER OTTAWA WAS A SOLITUDE THE ALGONQUINS OF ALLUMETTE ISLAND AND THE SHORES ADJACENT HAD ALL BEEN KILLED OR DRIVEN AWAY NEVER AGAIN TO RETURN
AN URGENT INVITATION TO VISIT THEM IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY BUTEUX WHO HAD LONG BEEN STATIONED AT THREE RIVERS WAS IN ILL HEALTH AND FOR YEARS
THEN AFTER MANY A DAY OF LONELY TRAVEL THE VOYAGER FOUND A SAVAGE WELCOME AMONG THE NIPISSINGS ON THE LAKE WHICH BEARS THEIR NAME AND THEN CIRCLING WEST AND SOUTH FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES OF SOLITUDE
POINT SAINT IGNACE NOW GRAHAM'S POINT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE STRAIT
FOR THE HURONS THEMSELVES WERE NO LESS DECEIVED THAN WERE THE IROQUOIS ENVOYS DURING ONE OR TWO SUCCEEDING DAYS MANY MESSAGES AND VISITS PASSED BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE IROQUOIS WHOSE CONFIDENCE WAS SUCH THAT
AND THEREFORE THAT GOD IS GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO ALLOW OF A MIDDLE STATE WHERE THEY MAY BE PURIFIED BY CERTAIN DEGREES OF SUFFERING YOU SEE SIR THERE IS NOTHING UNREASONABLE IN THIS BOSWELL BUT THEN SIR THEIR MASSES FOR THE DEAD JOHNSON WHY SIR
HE KNOWS THE LANDLORD DOES NOT LET HIM HAVE HIS LAND FOR LESS THAN HE CAN GET FROM OTHERS IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE SHOPKEEPER SELLS HIS GOODS NO SHOPKEEPER SELLS A YARD OF RIBBAND FOR SIXPENCE WHEN SEVEN PENCE IS THE CURRENT PRICE BOSWELL
BOSWELL BUT WOULD YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE OF REARING IT
ET DOCENDUM FOR REFORMATION AND INSTRUCTION NO SEVERITY IS CRUEL WHICH OBSTINACY MAKES NECESSARY FOR THE GREATEST CRUELTY WOULD BE TO DESIST
NOT SO AS THAT HE SHALL ONLY BE EXPOSED TO RIDICULE BOSWELL FOR MY PART I LIKE VERY WELL TO HEAR HONEST GOLDSMITH TALK AWAY CARELESSLY JOHNSON WHY YES SIR BUT
WHICH PROVED IN MANY INSTANCES A MOST RIGOROUS PUNISHMENT
HE IS ONLY SUPERADDING TO WHAT HE ALREADY HAD BUT A CONVERT FROM POPERY TO PROTESTANTISM GIVES UP SO MUCH OF WHAT HE HAS HELD AS SACRED AS ANY THING THAT HE RETAINS
ARE GOVERNED BY THEM FOR THE SAME REASON HE SAID MANKIND HAVE A STRONG ATTACHMENT TO THE HABITATIONS TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED YOU SEE THE INHABITANTS OF NORWAY DO NOT WITH ONE CONSENT QUIT IT
SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO PAY ALL THE DEBTS OF THE DECEASED AS HAVING BEEN GUILTY OF WHAT WAS TECHNICALLY CALLED VICIOUS INTROMISSION THE COURT OF SESSION
AND IF WE APPLY THIS CONSIDERATION TO THE HUMAN MIND THERE IS NO FREE WILL
NO MAN IS SO LITTLE ABLE TO DETERMINE AS THOSE WHO HAVE DETERMINED AGAINST HIM THE PARENTS OF THE OFFENDERS IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT HE USED UNPRECEDENTED AND IMPROPER INSTRUMENTS OF CORRECTION
ON SATURDAY APRIL ELEVENTH HE APPOINTED ME TO COME TO HIM IN THE EVENING WHEN HE SHOULD BE AT LEISURE TO GIVE ME SOME ASSISTANCE FOR THE DEFENCE OF HASTIE THE SCHOOLMASTER OF CAMPBELLTOWN FOR WHOM I WAS TO APPEAR IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS
I DID NOT PRESS IT FURTHER
HAS SOMETIMES DEPARTED CANNOT BE DENIED BUT AS IT IS EVIDENT THAT SUCH DEVIATIONS AS THEY MAKE LAW UNCERTAIN
HE ANSWERED IN A PASSION NO SIR LET IT ALONE IT MATTERS NOT HOW A MAN DIES BUT HOW HE LIVES
BOSWELL BUT IS NOT THE FEAR OF DEATH NATURAL TO MAN JOHNSON
OF GENERAL HAPPINESS THE PRODUCT OF GENERAL CONFIDENCE THERE IS YET NO THOUGHT MEN CONTINUE TO PROSECUTE THEIR OWN ADVANTAGES BY THE NEAREST WAY AND THE UTMOST SEVERITY OF THE CIVIL LAW IS NECESSARY
NOW SAID HE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO MARRY DO NOT EXPECT MORE FROM LIFE THAN LIFE WILL AFFORD YOU MAY OFTEN FIND YOURSELF OUT OF HUMOUR AND YOU MAY OFTEN THINK YOUR WIFE NOT STUDIOUS ENOUGH TO PLEASE YOU
BUT BE SURE THAT THE STEAM BE DIRECTED TO THY HEAD FOR THAT IS THE PECCANT PART THIS PRODUCED A TRIUMPHANT ROAR OF LAUGHTER FROM THE MOTLEY ASSEMBLY OF PHILOSOPHERS PRINTERS AND DEPENDENTS MALE AND FEMALE
WITH SUCH COMPREHENSION OF MIND AND SUCH CLEARNESS OF PENETRATION DID HE THUS TREAT A SUBJECT ALTOGETHER NEW TO HIM WITHOUT ANY OTHER PREPARATION THAN MY
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP UPON POTATOES QUANTITY MAKES UP FOR QUALITY BOSWELL WOULD YOU TEACH THIS CHILD THAT I HAVE FURNISHED YOU WITH ANY THING JOHNSON NO I SHOULD NOT BE APT TO TEACH IT BOSWELL
THERE IS NO ARGUING WITH JOHNSON FOR WHEN HIS PISTOL MISSES FIRE HE KNOCKS YOU DOWN WITH THE BUTT END OF IT HE TURNED TO THE GENTLEMAN
HE HOLDS HIS FINGER IN THE FLAME OF A CANDLE WITHOUT FEELING PAIN WOULD YOU BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE DIES HE AT LEAST GIVES UP ALL HE HAS BOSWELL FOOTE SIR TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE WAS VERY ILL HE WAS NOT AFRAID TO DIE JOHNSON
THOSE WHO BEFORE INVADED PASTURES AND STORMED HOUSES NOW BEGIN TO ENRICH THEMSELVES BY UNEQUAL CONTRACTS AND FRAUDULENT INTROMISSIONS
BUT IF YOU PLEASE YOU MAY LET YOUR LANDS CHEAP AND SO GET THE VALUE PART IN MONEY AND PART IN HOMAGE I SHOULD AGREE WITH YOU IN THAT BOSWELL SO SIR YOU LAUGH AT SCHEMES OF POLITICAL IMPROVEMENT JOHNSON
DEAR SIR UPON BALANCING THE INCONVENIENCES OF BOTH PARTIES I FIND IT WILL LESS INCOMMODE YOU TO SPEND YOUR NIGHT HERE THAN ME TO COME TO TOWN I WISH TO SEE YOU AND AM ORDERED BY THE LADY OF THIS HOUSE TO INVITE YOU HITHER WHETHER YOU CAN COME OR NOT
BEGGING THAT HE WOULD MEET ME IN TOWN ON THE NINTH BUT IF THIS SHOULD BE VERY INCONVENIENT TO HIM I WOULD GO THITHER HIS ANSWER WAS AS FOLLOWS
AND CONTINUED FOR A LONG PERIOD TO BE AN ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE IN THAT LAW THAT WHOEVER INTERMEDDLED WITH THE EFFECTS OF A PERSON DECEASED WITHOUT THE INTERPOSITION OF LEGAL AUTHORITY TO GUARD AGAINST EMBEZZLEMENT
IT HAS BEEN OBJECTED THAT THE RESPONDENT ADMITS THE CHARGE OF CRUELTY BY PRODUCING NO EVIDENCE TO CONFUTE IT LET IT BE CONSIDERED THAT HIS SCHOLARS ARE EITHER DISPERSED AT LARGE IN THE WORLD
I THUS VENTURED TO MENTION ALL THE COMMON OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE ROMAN CATHOLICK CHURCH THAT I MIGHT HEAR SO GREAT A MAN UPON THEM
THOUGH THERE SHOULD BE LITTLE PROFIT IN MONEY THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE PROFIT IN PLEASURE AS IT GIVES TO ONE NATION THE PRODUCTIONS OF ANOTHER
BEFORE THE FEROCITY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THIS PART OF THE ISLAND WAS SUBDUED THE UTMOST SEVERITY OF THE CIVIL LAW WAS NECESSARY TO RESTRAIN INDIVIDUALS FROM PLUNDERING EACH OTHER THUS THE MAN WHO INTERMEDDLED
BECAUSE IT IS CONTRARY TO THE EXPRESS INSTITUTION OF CHRIST
IT IS EXTREMELY REMARKABLE THAT IN PROPORTION TO OUR IMPROVEMENT IN MANNERS THIS REGULATION HAS BEEN GRADUALLY SOFTENED AND APPLIED BY OUR SOVEREIGN COURT WITH A SPARING HAND
THOUGH THE PEOPLE MAY BE DISPOSED OF IN DIFFERENT WAYS WE SEE IF CORN BE DEAR AND BUTCHERS MEAT CHEAP THE FARMERS ALL APPLY THEMSELVES TO THE RAISING OF CORN TILL IT BECOMES PLENTIFUL AND CHEAP AND THEN BUTCHERS MEAT BECOMES DEAR
WISHED TO INFORM US OF THIS SIMPLE FACT THAT THE COUNSEL UPON THE CIRCUIT AT SHREWSBURY WERE MUCH BITTEN BY FLEAS TOOK I SUPPOSE SEVEN OR EIGHT MINUTES IN RELATING IT CIRCUMSTANTIALLY HE IN A
DID NOT ANSWER IT BUT TALKING FOR VICTORY AND DETERMINED TO BE MASTER OF THE FIELD HE HAD RECOURSE TO THE DEVICE WHICH GOLDSMITH IMPUTED TO HIM IN THE WITTY WORDS OF ONE OF CIBBER'S COMEDIES
LIVING EACH MAN TO HIMSELF TAKING FROM THE WEAK AND LOSING TO THE STRONG IN THEIR FIRST COALITIONS OF SOCIETY
MAY BE CONFIRMED BY MANY AND EMINENT INSTANCES SOME OF WHICH WILL OCCUR TO MOST OF MY READERS WHEN WE WERE ALONE I INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT OF DEATH AND ENDEAVOURED TO MAINTAIN THAT THE FEAR OF IT MIGHT BE GOT OVER I TOLD HIM THAT DAVID HUME SAID TO ME
BUT UPON MY PERSEVERING IN MY QUESTION REPLIED WHY YES SIR I WOULD BUT I MUST HAVE ALL CONVENIENCIES IF I HAD NO GARDEN I WOULD MAKE A SHED ON THE ROOF AND TAKE IT THERE FOR FRESH AIR I SHOULD FEED IT
I FIND MYSELF UNDER A NECESSITY OF OBSERVING THAT THIS LEARNED AND JUDICIOUS WRITER
NO SIR WHILE LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS A DISTINCTION THE FEW WHO HAVE THAT DISTINCTION
THEY HAD NOT YET LEARNED TO CHEAT AND ATTEMPTED ONLY TO ROB AS MANNERS GROW MORE POLISHED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD MEN ATTAIN LIKEWISE DEXTERITY IN EVIL
AND WASH IT MUCH AND WITH WARM WATER TO PLEASE IT NOT WITH COLD WATER TO GIVE IT PAIN BOSWELL BUT SIR DOES NOT HEAT RELAX JOHNSON SIR YOU ARE NOT TO IMAGINE THE WATER IS TO BE VERY HOT I WOULD NOT CODDLE THE CHILD
ON WHOM I HAPPENED TO CALL IN THE MORNING SAID HE WOULD JOIN US WHICH HE DID AND WE SPENT A VERY AGREEABLE DAY THOUGH I RECOLLECT BUT LITTLE OF WHAT PASSED HE SAID
WE MAY HAVE A LAW OR WE MAY HAVE NO LAW BUT WE CANNOT HAVE HALF A LAW WE MUST EITHER HAVE A RULE OF ACTION OR BE PERMITTED TO ACT BY DISCRETION AND BY CHANCE
IF I COME TO AN ORCHARD AND SAY THERE'S NO FRUIT HERE AND THEN COMES A PORING MAN
BUT THIS WAS A QUESTION WHICH THE ADVENTURER MEANT TO HAVE ANSWERED BEFORE HE WENT OUT IT WAS HARD UPON TWELVE O'CLOCK WHEN THE MIRROR ON THE DRESSING TABLE ASSURED HIM THAT HE WAS AT LENGTH POINT DEVICE IN THE HABIT AND APPAREL OF A GENTLEMAN OF ELEGANT NOCTURNAL LEISURE
HE COULD HAVE SWORN HE HAD NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE NONE THE LESS SOMETHING IN ITS EVIL CAST PERSISTENTLY TROUBLED HIS MEMORY WITH THE SAME PROVOKING AND BAFFLING EFFECT THAT HAD ATTENDED THEIR FIRST ENCOUNTER
DON'T LET THAT WORRY YOU HE ADVISED CHEERFULLY
SEE WHAT WE FOUND THERE TO DAY SHE SLIPPED A RING FROM HER HAND AND PASSED IT TO DE MORBIHAN THERE FOLLOWED SILENCE FOR AN INSTANT THEN AN EXCLAMATION FROM THE FRENCHMAN BUT IT IS SUPERB ACCEPT MADEMOISELLE MY COMPLIMENTS IT IS WORTHY EVEN OF YOU
THE MAJORITY OF THESE WERE IN COUPLES BUT AT A TABLE ONE REMOVED FROM RODDY'S SAT A PARTY OF THREE AND LANYARD NOTICED OR FANCIED THAT THE MAN FROM SCOTLAND YARD TURNED HIS NEWSPAPER ONLY DURING LULLS IN THE CONVERSATION IN THIS QUARTER OF THE THREE
HE HAD LEFT THE SHADES DOWN AND THE HANGINGS DRAWN AT BOTH WINDOWS AND SINCE THESE HAD NOT BEEN DISTURBED SOMETHING NEARLY APPROACHING COMPLETE DARKNESS REIGNED IN THE ROOM BUT THOUGH PROMPTLY ON ENTERING HIS FINGERS CLOSED UPON THE WALL SWITCH NEAR THE DOOR
AND HE WONDERED WITH A THRILL OF AMUSEMENT IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THAT RODDY WAS ON THE TRAIL OF THAT TREMENDOUS BUCK IF SO IT WOULD BE A CHASE WORTH FOLLOWING A DIVERSION RENDERED THE MORE EXQUISITE TO LANYARD BY THE SPICE OF NOVELTY SINCE FOR ONCE HE WOULD FIGURE AS A DISPASSIONATE BYSTANDER
THEY SAY HE'S ON THE PROWL ONCE MORE THE AMERICAN LAUGHED A TRACE CONTEMPTUOUSLY LANYARD'S FINGERS TIGHTENED ON HIS KNIFE AND FORK OTHERWISE HE MADE NO SIGN A SIDELONG GLANCE INTO A MIRROR AT HIS ELBOW SHOWED RODDY STILL ABSORBED IN THE DAILY MAIL
AND THE PLOT HAD SUCCEEDED DESPITE ITS PARTIAL FAILURE DESPITE THE SWIFT REVERSE CHANCE AND LANYARD'S CUNNING HAD METED OUT TO THE PACK'S AGENT IT WAS HIS DRESSING GOWN THAT WAS SATURATE WITH RODDY'S BLOOD JUST AS THEY WERE HIS GLOVES PILFERED FROM HIS LUGGAGE
HE WAS IN BERLIN AT THE TIME OF THE FAMOUS RHEINART ROBBERY THOUGH HE COMPASSED THAT COUP WITHOUT DETECTION HE WAS IN VIENNA WHEN THE BRITISH EMBASSY THERE WAS LOOTED
SOMETHING SMALL AND SILVER BRIGHT THAT CAUGHT LANYARD'S EYE PICKING IT UP HE EXAMINED WITH INTEREST A SMALL HYPODERMIC SYRINGE LOADED TO THE FULL CAPACITY OF ITS GLASS CYLINDER PLUNGER DRAWN BACK ALL READY FOR INSTANT SERVICE
OR ELSE SEEK DE MORBIHAN AND SOLICIT HIS PROTECTION HIS BOASTED INFLUENCE IN HIGH QUARTERS BUT TO GIVE HIMSELF INTO THE HANDS TO BECOME AN ASSOCIATE OF ONE WHO COULD BE PARTY TO SO COWARDLY A CRIME AS THIS
BUT HIS DECISION WAS FRIGHTFULLY HAMPERED BY LACK OF READY MONEY THE FEW ODD FRANCS IN HIS POCKET WERE NO STORE FOR THE WAR CHEST DEMANDED BY THIS EMERGENCY TRUE HE HAD THE OMBER JEWELS BUT THEY WERE NOT NEGOTIABLE NOT AT LEAST IN PARIS AND THE HUYSMAN PLANS
THE GIRL BENT FORWARD WITH A LOOK OF EAGER INTEREST THE LONE WOLF WHO IS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HIM IN AMERICA MADEMOISELLE NO
AT LEAST HE FOUND THIS NEWS ABOUT HER MOST SURPRISING
NO I MUST CONTINUE VERY WELL I CONFESS TO SOME LITTLE PRIDE IT WAS A FEAT HE IS CUNNING THAT ONE DE MORBIHAN PAUSED AND SHIFTED SIDEWAYS IN HIS CHAIR GRINNING LIKE A MISCHIEVOUS CHILD BY THIS MANOEUVRE
TURN ABOUT HE REFLECTED IS SAID TO BE FAIR PLAY WELL WHY NOT HE BENT FORWARD
AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE THE CITY BY ANY ORDINARY CHANNEL WOULD BE TO INVITE EITHER DENUNCIATION TO THE POLICE ON THE CHARGE OF MURDER OR ONE OF THOSE FATALLY EXPEDITIOUS FORMS OF ASSASSINATION OF WHICH THE APACHES ARE PAST MASTERS HE MUST AND WOULD FIND ANOTHER WAY
REST ASSURED THE CHIEF OF THE SURETE HAS LAID HIS PLANS HIS WEB IS SPUN AND SO ARTFULLY THAT I THINK OUR UNSOCIABLE OUTLAW WILL SOON BE MAKING FRIENDS IN THE PRISON OF THE SANTE BUT NOW WE MUST ADJOURN ONE IS SORRY IT HAS BEEN SO VERY PLEASANT
LANYARD TOLD HIMSELF HE WOULD SOONER PAY THE GUILLOTINE THE PENALTY CONSULTING HIS WATCH HE FOUND THE HOUR TO BE NO LATER THAN HALF PAST FOUR SO SWIFTLY
IN HIS ABSTRACTION HE WANDERED TO A CHAIR OVER WHOSE BACK HUNG A LIGHT DRESSING GOWN OF WINE COLOURED SILK WHICH BECAUSE IT WOULD PACK IN SMALL COMPASS WAS IN THE HABIT OF CARRYING WITH HIM ON HIS TRAVELS LANYARD HAD LEFT THIS THROWN ACROSS HIS BED
HE REFRAINED FROM TURNING UP THE LIGHTS IMMEDIATELY WITH A FANCY OF IMPISH INSPIRATION THAT IT WOULD BE AMUSING TO LEARN WHAT MOVE RODDY WOULD MAKE WHEN THE TENSION BECAME TOO MUCH EVEN FOR HIS TRAINED NERVES
HE WORKED RAPIDLY AT A HIGH PITCH OF EXCITEMENT AS MUCH THROUGH SHEER DESPERATION AS THROUGH ANY APPEAL INHERENT IN THE SCHEME EITHER TO HIS COMMON SENSE OR TO HIS ROMANTIC BENT IN TWO MINUTES HE HAD STRIPPED THE MOUSTACHE CLEAN AWAY FROM THAT STUPID FLACCID MASK
WITH THIS HARVEST OF NOTHING FOR HIS PAINS LANYARD TURNED AGAIN TO THE WASH STAND AND HIS SHAVING KIT MIXED A STIFF LATHER STROPPED ANOTHER RAZOR TO THE FINEST EDGE HE COULD MANAGE FETCHED A PAIR OF KEEN SCISSORS FROM HIS DRESSING CASE AND WENT BACK TO THE MURDERER
WHILE NOT A FEW MEN PERHAPS FOR THAT REASON DID THEIR POSSESSOR THE HONOUR TO IMITATE THEM
WITH HIS IMAGINATION TO BOOT BUT THERE WAS NEVER A SOUND OR MOVEMENT IN ALL THE HOUSE THAT HE COULD DETECT
LANYARD FOR ONE WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT HIM THE PROPEREST COMPANY OR THE BEST PARISIAN CICERONE FOR AN AILING AMERICAN GENTLEMAN BLESSED WITH INDEPENDENT MEANS AND AN ATTRACTIVE DAUGHTER PARIS ON THE OTHER HAND PARIS WHO FORGIVES EVERYTHING TO HIM WHO CONTRIBUTES TO HER AMUSEMENT
HALF EXPECTING IT TO QUICKEN WITH INSTANT AND VIOLENT ACTION BUT IT RESPONDED IN NO WAY WITH A NOD OF SATISFACTION HE SHIFTED THE LIGHT UNTIL IT MARKED DOWN THE NEAREST ELECTRIC BULB WHICH PROVED IN LINE WITH HIS INFERENCE
THE MAN FROM SCOTLAND YARD HAD JUST SURRENDERED HAT COAT AND UMBRELLA TO THE VESTIAIRE AND WAS TURNING THROUGH SWINGING DOORS TO THE DINING ROOM AGAIN EMBRACING LANYARD HIS GLANCE SEEMED DEVOID OF ANY SORT OF INTELLIGIBLE EXPRESSION AND IF ITS OBJECT NEEDED ALL HIS SELF POSSESSION IN THAT MOMENT
AND WHEN IN A SWIFT FLASH OF INTUITION HE EXAMINED HIS FINGERS HE DISCOVERED THEM DISCOLOURED WITH A FAINT REDDISH STAIN HAD THE DYE RUN AND HOW HAD THE AMERICAN COME TO DABBLE THE GARMENT IN WATER TO WHAT END THEN
THROUGH THIS PERFUNCTORY DECEASE THE LONE WOLF WOULD GAIN A FREEDOM EVEN GREATER THAN BEFORE THE PACK HAD CONTRIVED ONLY TO ELIMINATE MICHAEL LANYARD THE AMATEUR OF FINE PAINTINGS REMAINED THE LONE WOLF WITH NOT ONE FACULTY IMPAIRED
SUDDENLY CONSCIOUS OF A DRY AND BURNING THROAT HE ROSE AND GOING TO THE WASHSTAND DRANK DEEP AND THIRSTILY FROM A WATER BOTTLE
THE FIRST REMARK OVERHEARD BY LANYARD CAME FROM THE ELDERLY AMERICAN FOLLOWING A PAUSE AND A CONSULTATION OF HIS WATCH QUARTER TO ELEVEN HE ANNOUNCED
AND BY THIS MEANS SEVERAL FINE FISH WERE ENMESHED IN THE NET OF SUSPICION CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED AND ONE BY ONE LET GO ALL EXCEPT ONE THE VERITABLE MAN HIM THEY SEDULOUSLY WATCHED SHADOWING HIM ACROSS EUROPE AND BACK AGAIN
WITH A LOW CRY SMITTEN WITH AWFUL UNDERSTANDING LANYARD WHEELED AND STARED FEARFULLY AT THE DOOR COMMUNICATING WITH RODDY'S ROOM IT STOOD AJAR AN INCH OR TWO
IT WAS TO DISSEMBLE RELIEF RATHER THAN DISMAY AN ACCENT OF THE FORTUITOUS DISTINGUISHED THIS SECOND ENCOUNTER TOO PERSUASIVELY TO EXCUSE FURTHER MISGIVINGS WHAT THE ADVENTURER HIMSELF HADN'T KNOWN TILL WITHIN THE LAST TEN MINUTES THAT HE WAS COMING TO TROYON'S
AS YOU WILL MY FRIEND HE GRANTED BUT SHOULD YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND WELL YOU'LL HAVE NO TROUBLE FINDING US ASK ANY PLACE ALONG THE REGULAR ROUTE WE SEE FAR TOO LITTLE OF ONE ANOTHER MONSIEUR
BUT ALSO TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NO RODDY WERE DISPOSED TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
BEEN IMPATIENT OF SUCH SIDE ISSUES OR INCREDULOUS AND PERSISTED IN FOCUSING ITS PROCESSES UPON THE PERSONALITY AND ACTIVITIES OF MONSIEUR LE COMTE REMY DE MORBIHAN HOWEVER ONE WOULD SURELY LEARN SOMETHING ILLUMINATING BEFORE VERY LONG
FURROWED SEAMED TWISTED A MASK OF MORTAL ANGUISH AND ONCE WHEN THIS ONE LOOKED UP AND CASUALLY ENCOUNTERED LANYARD'S GAZE THE ADVENTURER WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HIMSELF STARING INTO EYES LIKE THOSE OF A DEAD MAN
EVEN UNCONSCIOUSLY WITH A WIFE A MISTRESS A CHILD
ANOTHER TIME PERHAPS' HIS INVARIABLE EXCUSE I TELL YOU NOT TWO MEN IN ALL PARIS HAVE ANY REAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS GENTLEMAN WHOM ALL PARIS KNOWS
AND SLOWLY GULPING DOWN A SECOND BOTTLE OF BASS
ONE MIGHT PASS FOR AN AMERICAN OF POSITION AND WEALTH
BUT THE ADVENTURER WAS SATISFIED THAT IN HIS PROPER GUISE AS HIMSELF HE NEEDED ONLY TO OPEN THAT POSTERN DOOR AT THE STREET END OF THE PASSAGE TO FEEL A KNIFE SLIP IN BETWEEN HIS RIBS
BEFORE RISING HE TURNED OUT THE POCKETS OF HIS COUNTERFEIT BUT THIS PROFITED HIM LITTLE THE ASSASSIN HAD DRESSED FOR ACTION WITH FORETHOUGHT TO EVADE RECOGNITION IN EVENT OF ACCIDENT LANYARD COLLECTED ONLY A CHEAP AMERICAN WATCH
SO ANXIOUS WAS I TO PROVE THE SINCERITY OF MY LOVE FOR BRIGITTE THAT I HARDLY DARED KISS THE HEM OF HER DRESS HER LIGHTEST WORDS MADE ME TREMBLE AS THOUGH HER VOICE WAS STRANGE TO ME
THE EVILS YOU ENDURE OTHERS HAVE SUFFERED AND NOTHING IS SINGULAR OR PECULIAR TO YOU THINK OF THOSE WHO HAVE NO MOTHER NO RELATIVES NO FRIENDS OF THOSE WHO SEEK AND DO NOT FIND OF THOSE WHO LOVE IN VAIN OF THOSE WHO DIE AND ARE FORGOTTEN
AND THE PHYSICISTS WE ARE TOLD GRIND TO INFINITY THE SMALLEST SPECK OF DUST WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO ANNIHILATE IT IF MATTER IS THE PROPERTY OF CHANCE WHAT HARM CAN IT DO TO CHANGE ITS FORM SINCE IT CAN NOT CEASE TO BE MATTER
I NO LONGER DISBELIEVED IN HIM NEITHER AS A CHILD NOR AT SCHOOL NOR AS A MAN HAVE I FREQUENTED CHURCHES MY RELIGION IF I HAD ANY HAD NEITHER RITE NOR SYMBOL AND I BELIEVED IN A GOD WITHOUT FORM WITHOUT A CULT AND WITHOUT REVELATION
YOU NO LONGER EXPERIENCE VAGUE DESIRES BUT REAL REGRETS YOUR HEART IS NO LONGER HUNGRY IT IS BROKEN AND YOU HESITATE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT SINCE SHE NO LONGER CARES FOR YOUR LIFE IT COUNTS FOR NOTHING SINCE SHE ABANDONS YOU ABANDON YOURSELF
ALREADY LAUSANNE VEVAY OBERLAND AND BEYOND THE SUMMITS OF MONTE ROSA AND THE IMMENSE PLAIN OF LOMBARDY ALREADY OBLIVION REPOSE FLIGHT
SHE CUT FROM HER HEAD A LONG TRESS OF HAIR THEN SHE LOOKED AT HERSELF THUS DISFIGURED AND DEPRIVED OF A PART OF HER BEAUTIFUL CROWN AND GAVE IT TO HER LOVER THE CLOCK STRUCK AGAIN IT WAS TIME TO GO WHEN THEY PASSED OUT THEY SEEMED AS JOYFUL AS WHEN THEY ENTERED
I REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME IN THIS STRANGE CALM JUST AS THE MAN WHO RECEIVES A THRUST FROM A POIGNARD FEELS AT FIRST ONLY THE COLD STEEL WHEN HE HAS GONE SOME DISTANCE ON HIS WAY HE BECOMES WEAK HIS EYES START FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND HE ASKS WHAT HAS HAPPENED
NEVERTHELESS THIS EVENING HE HAD A PIECE OF MONEY IN HIS POCKET HE ENTERED A TAVERN WHERE HE PURCHASED OBLIVION HE HAS EARNED ENOUGH IN A WEEK TO ENJOY A NIGHT OF SLUMBER
MY MISSION WILL HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND I SHALL ALWAYS BE THANKFUL FOR IT FINALLY WE DECIDED TO GO TO GENEVA AND THEN CHOOSE SOME RESTING PLACE IN THE ALPS
THE STERILE MILK OF IMPIETY HUMAN PRIDE THAT GOD OF THE EGOIST CLOSED MY MOUTH AGAINST PRAYER WHILE MY AFFRIGHTED SOUL TOOK REFUGE IN THE HOPE OF NOTHINGNESS I WAS AS THOUGH DRUNKEN OR INSENSATE WHEN I SAW THAT EFFIGY OF CHRIST ON BRIGITTE'S BOSOM
THESE THINGS ARE BUT AN ABSURD DREAM I RECALLED THE TIME WHEN I WAS IGNORANT OF LIFE WHEN I WAS TAKING MY FIRST STEPS IN EXPERIENCE I REMEMBERED AN OLD BEGGAR WHO USED TO SIT ON A STONE BENCH BEFORE THE FARM GATE TO WHOM I WAS SOMETIMES SENT WITH THE REMAINS OF OUR MORNING MEAL
THERE WAS ONE VIEW THAT SEEMED TO PLEASE HER MORE THAN ALL THE OTHERS IT WAS A CERTAIN SPOT
LET THAT PART OF US WHICH IS STILL JOINED IN GOD'S SIGHT NEVER KNOW THAT WE HAVE PARTED UPON EARTH LET NOT THE PALTRY CHANCE OF A MOMENT UNDO THE UNION OF OUR ETERNAL HAPPINESS HE HELD THE WOMAN'S HAND
AND IT WAS SHE WHO WITH HER PALE HALF MOCKING FEATURES
YOU WILL SPEAK OF YOUR YOUTH AND YOU WILL PERSUADE YOURSELF THAT HEAVEN OUGHT TO PARDON YOU THAT YOUR MISFORTUNES ARE INVOLUNTARY AND YOU WILL IMPLORE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS TO GRANT YOU A LITTLE REPOSE BUT WHO KNOWS YOU ARE STILL YOUNG
AND WE SIT DOWN IN OUR TEARS AS DID ADAM AT EDEN'S GATE AND IN ORDER TO CURE OUR WOUND WE HAVE BUT TO MAKE A MOVEMENT OF THE HAND AND MOISTEN OUR THROATS
I DID NOT REMEMBER EVER HAVING SEEN IT BEFORE DOUBTLESS AT THE MOMENT OF SETTING OUT SHE HAD SUSPENDED IT ABOUT HER NECK AS A PRESERVING CHARM AGAINST THE DANGERS OF THE JOURNEY SUDDENLY I JOINED MY HANDS AND KNELT ON THE FLOOR
IT IS THUS THAT ONE DRINKS AWAY SHAME YOU HAVE BEGUN BY BEING GOOD YOU WILL BECOME WEAK AND YOU WILL BECOME A MONSTER MY POOR FRIEND SAID I FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART I HAVE A WORD OF ADVICE FOR YOU AND IT IS THIS I BELIEVE THAT YOU MUST DIE
SINCE SHE ADDED YOU REALLY FIND ME UGLY AS SHE SPOKE I RAISED MY EYES PERHAPS MY DRUNKENNESS DECEIVED ME OR PERHAPS I HAD NOT SEEN HER FACE CLEARLY BEFORE
GOD THE JUICE OF A GRAPE CRUSHED UNDER THE FOOT SUFFICES TO DISSIPATE THE DEEPEST SORROW AND TO BREAK ALL THE INVISIBLE THREADS THAT THE FATES WEAVE ABOUT OUR PATHWAY WE WEEP LIKE WOMEN WE SUFFER LIKE MARTYRS
ON ANOTHER OCCASION I HAD BOUGHT AN ALBUM CONTAINING VIEWS OF SWITZERLAND WE WERE LOOKING AT THEM ALL THREE OF US AND WHEN BRIGITTE FOUND A SITE THAT PLEASED HER SHE WOULD STOP TO EXAMINE IT
WHEN I SPOKE OF OUR DEPARTURE SHE AROSE COLD AND RESIGNED AND CONTINUED HER PREPARATIONS WHEN I SWORE TO HER THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE HAPPY AND THAT I WOULD CONSECRATE MY LIFE TO HER
AND WHEN WE WERE EXTENDED SIDE BY SIDE IN OUR NARROW BED THE WORLD COULD WALK OVER OUR GRAVES WITHOUT DISTURBING US IS IT NOT TRUE MY WELL BELOVED IS IT NOT TRUE THAT IT WOULD BE WELL WITH US IT IS A SOFT BED THAT BED OF EARTH NO SUFFERING CAN REACH US THERE
AND SPARE THEM THE SEVERE LESSONS OF UNHAPPINESS OUR WISDOM AND SKEPTICISM ARE IN OUR HANDS BUT CHILDREN'S TOYS FORGIVE US FOR DREAMING THAT WE CAN DEFY THEE THOU WHO SMILEST AT GOLGOTHA THE WORST RESULT OF ALL OUR VAIN MISERY IS THAT IT TEMPTS US TO FORGET THEE
I AM TRYING TO SEE IF I CAN NOT CHANGE THAT FACE SLIGHTLY AND MAKE IT RESEMBLE YOURS THE PRETTY HAT WOULD BECOME YOU AND CAN I NOT IF I AM SKILFUL GIVE THAT FINE MOUNTAINEER SOME RESEMBLANCE TO ME
AND YOU DO NOT BELIEVE YOURSELF GUILTY I DEMANDED WITH HORROR O NOVICE OF YESTERDAY HOW CORRUPT TO DAY BECAUSE YOU WEEP YOU FONDLY IMAGINE YOURSELF INNOCENT WHAT YOU CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR CONSCIENCE IS ONLY REMORSE AND WHAT MURDERER DOES NOT EXPERIENCE IT
OF A YOUNG GIRL IS FIXED ON THE DAY OF HER MARRIAGE THUS LITTLE BY LITTLE HE EXPRESSED WHAT WAS IN HIS HEART AND I WATCHED BRIGITTE LISTENING TO HIM THEN WHEN HE AROSE TO LEAVE US I ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DOOR AND STOOD THERE
BUT ALTHOUGH IGNORANT OF THEIR SECRET ONE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THEY WERE SUFFERING TOGETHER AND WHATEVER THEIR MYSTERIOUS TROUBLE IT COULD BE SEEN THAT THEY HAD PLACED ON THEIR SORROW A SEAL MORE POWERFUL THAN LOVE ITSELF FRIENDSHIP
IN TO MORROW'S JOURNAL WOULD APPEAR THE INTELLIGENCE THAT OCTAVE DE T HAD KILLED HIS MISTRESS AND THE DAY AFTER NO ONE WOULD SPEAK OF IT WHO WOULD FOLLOW US TO THE GRAVE NO ONE WHO UPON RETURNING TO HIS HOME COULD NOT ENJOY A HEARTY DINNER
ALTHOUGH I HAD ALMOST COMMITTED A CRIME WHEN MY HAND WAS ARRESTED I FELT THAT MY HEART WAS INNOCENT IN AN INSTANT CALM SELF POSSESSION REASON RETURNED I AGAIN APPROACHED THE BED I LEANED OVER MY IDOL AND KISSED THE CRUCIFIX
THE WHIM SEEMED TO PLEASE HER AND SHE SET ABOUT RUBBING OUT THE TWO FACES WHEN I HAD PAINTED HER PORTRAIT SHE WISHED TO TRY MINE THE FACES WERE VERY SMALL HENCE NOT VERY DIFFICULT
BUT SPAIN
IF THY SOBS DO NOT AWAKEN HER LITTLE BY LITTLE MY THOUGHTS MOUNTED AND BECAME MORE SOMBER UNTIL I RECOILED IN TERROR TO DO EVIL SUCH WAS THE ROLE IMPOSED UPON ME BY PROVIDENCE I TO DO EVIL
WERE SO DEAR TO US I STOPPED IN THE HALL EVERY NOTE REACHED
I REPEATED IN A LOW VOICE WHAT BRIGITTE HAD SAID AND I PLACED NEAR HER ALL THAT I SUPPOSED SHE WOULD NEED FOR THE NIGHT I LOOKED AT HER AND THEN WENT TO THE WINDOW AND PRESSED MY FOREHEAD AGAINST THE PANE PEERING OUT AT A SOMBER AND LOWERING SKY THEN I RETURNED TO THE BEDSIDE
SHE SHUT HERSELF UP IN HER ROOM AND WEPT WHEN I KISSED HER
I THREW MYSELF ON THE FOOT OF THE BED IN SUCH A FRIGHTFUL STATE OF DESPAIR THAT MY REASON FLED AND I NO LONGER KNEW WHERE I WAS OR WHAT I WAS DOING BRIGITTE SIGHED MY SENSES STIRRED WITHIN ME WAS IT GRIEF OR DESPAIR I DO NOT KNOW
I TO WHOM MY CONSCIENCE EVEN IN THE MIDST OF MY WILDEST FOLLIES SAID THAT I WAS GOOD I WHOM A PITILESS DESTINY WAS DRAGGING SWIFTLY TOWARD THE ABYSS AND WHOM A SECRET HORROR UNCEASINGLY WARNED OF THE AWFUL FATE TO COME
HE IS SEATED BEFORE AN ORGAN HIS WINGS ARE HALF FOLDED HIS HANDS EXTENDED OVER THE IVORY KEYS HE BEGINS AN ETERNAL HYMN THE HYMN OF LOVE AND IMMORTAL REST BUT HIS WINGS DROOP HIS HEAD FALLS OVER THE KEYS THE ANGEL OF DEATH HAS TOUCHED HIM ON THE SHOULDER
NOTHING COULD BE MORE SIMPLE
THE OCEAN OF EVIL THAT SURROUNDS US AND IS CONTENT TO HANG A SMALL BLACK FRUIT ALONG OUR PATHS SINCE THAT MAN SLEEPS SO SOUNDLY ON HIS BENCH WHY DO NOT I SLEEP ON MINE
YOU HAVE CLOSED THE DOOR YOU MISER YOU DEBATE WITH YOURSELF BEHIND LOCKS AND BOLTS SHAKE THEM FOR IT WAS YOUR HAND THAT FORGED THEM O FOOL WHO HAVE DESIRED AND HAVE POSSESSED YOUR DESIRE YOU HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF GOD
HER BROW SEEMED TO BEAR THE MARKS OF THAT CROWN OF THORNS WHICH IS THE DIADEM OF RESIGNATION I THOUGHT OF THE COTTAGE HOW YOUNG SHE WAS SIX MONTHS AGO HOW CHEERFUL HOW FREE HOW CARELESS WHAT HAD I DONE WITH ALL THAT
BEHOLDING MAN WALKING ABOUT UPON HIS EARTH UNTIL HE MEETS THE BECKONING FINGER OF DEATH COUNTING TEARS AND WATCHING THEM DRY UPON THE CHEEK OF PAIN NOTING THE PURE PROFILE OF LOVE AND THE WRINKLED FACE OF AGE SEEING HANDS STRETCHED UP TO HIM IN SUPPLICATION
EITHER IN THE SHAPE OF A CORONER OR A POLICEMAN ASKED ME ABOUT MY OWN ADVENTURES THAT NIGHT TO BE SURE I HAD SEEN A STRANGER AND I HAD OBSERVED THAT HE HAD LOST A COUPLE OF FINGERS THE FIRST AND SECOND OF HIS RIGHT HAND
AND LAID IT BEFORE HIS VISITOR IS THE WILL OF THE MAN WHOSE COMING TO BERWICK USHERED IN ALL THESE MYSTERIES NOW THEN DO YOU SEE WHO WAS ONE OF THE WITNESSES TO THE WILL LOOK MAN
DO YOU KNOW AUGHT OF THAT MAN JOHN PHILLIPS WHOSE NAME'S IN THE PAPERS TOO HE ASKED NO SIR NOTHING SHE REPLIED PROMPTLY NEVER HEARD TELL OF HIM
STARING AT THE MAN'S FACE OVER WHICH A GREY PALLOR WAS QUICKLY SPREADING ITSELF AND THOUGH I KNEW THAT HE WAS AS DEAD AS EVER A MAN CAN BE I CALLED TO HIM AND THE SOUND OF MY OWN VOICE FRIGHTENED ME
SHE ANSWERED AND TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF SIR
BUT I ANSWERED THAT LAST QUESTION AS SOON AS I ASKED IT AND IN THE NEGATIVE FOR THE LIGHT OF MY LAMP SHOWED A FINE HEAVY GOLD WATCH CHAIN FESTOONED ACROSS THE MAN'S WAISTCOAT IF MURDEROUSLY INCLINED THIEVES HAD BEEN AT HIM
AND FINDING MYSELF JUST THEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE NORTH BRITISH RAILWAY STATION I WENT IN AND MANAGED TO MAKE OUT THAT IF MISTER LINDSEY WAS AT THE OFFICE WHEN MY WIRE ARRIVED AND ACTED PROMPTLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT HE AND THEY
SHE'S MISSING SINCE LAST NIGHT I REPLIED IT CAME TO ME THAT SHE LIKELY TOOK A SHORT CUT ACROSS THESE GROUNDS AND THAT IN DOING SO SHE FELL IN WITH SIR GILBERT OR WITH YOU AND WAS KEPT LEST SHE SHOULD LET OUT WHAT SHE'D SEEN
MAYBE YOUR MOTHER HUGH CAN FIND MISSUS HANSON A LODGING I ANSWERED THAT MY MOTHER WOULD NO DOUBT DO WHAT SHE COULD TO LOOK AFTER MISSUS HANSON AND PRESENTLY THE WOMAN WENT AWAY WITH MAISIE LEAVING HER PAPERS WITH MISTER LINDSEY
ON WHAT WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY AN INNOCENT STRANGER SO I ANSWERED CHISHOLM'S QUESTION AS I MEANT TO ANSWER ANY SIMILAR ONE UNLESS INDEED I HAD REASON TO ALTER MY MIND
WHO ELSE SAID I CAN YOU THINK OF ANY OTHER THAT IT WOULD BE AND I'M WONDERING IF WHOEVER KILLED THIS FELLOW WHOEVER HE MAY BE WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED MISTER GILVERTHWAITE TOO IF HE'D COME
WHEN THIS MAN GILVERTHWAITE GAVE YOU HIS ORDERS HE ASKED NO ONE I ANSWERED AND YOU'VE TOLD ME EVERYTHING THAT HE SAID TO YOU AS NEAR AS I CAN RECOLLECT IT
WHAT WAS THIS MAN DOING AT THAT PLACE AND WHO WAS HE LIKELY TO MEET THERE WE HAVE SOME EVIDENCE ON THAT POINT AND HE ADDED WITH ONE SHREWD GLANCE AT THE LEGAL FOLK IN FRONT OF HIM
THIS IS NO BY CHANCE MURDER CHISHOLM AS YOU'LL BE FINDING OUT WELL WELL I NEVER KNEW ITS LIKE HE REMARKED STARING FROM ME TO THE BODY AND FROM IT TO ME
OF THE SCOTTISH AMERICAN BANK THE MANAGER WHO PRESENTLY RECEIVED US IN HIS PRIVATE ROOMS LOOKED AT MISTER LINDSEY AND MISTER PORTLETHORPE WITH EVIDENT SURPRISE
MISTER PALEY IMMEDIATELY TURNED TO A DIARY WHICH LAY ON HIS DESK AND GAVE ONE GLANCE AT IT
AND OF COURSE I WOULD LIKE TO PUT IN MY CLAIM TO WHAT HE'S LEFT IF HE'S LEFT IT TO NOBODY ELSE JUST SO AGREED MISTER LINDSEY AYE AND HOW LONG IS IT SINCE YOU LAST SAW YOUR BROTHER NOW
AND HE SWORE WARMLY AND PLENTIFULLY WHEN HE HEARD HOW TREACHEROUSLY I HAD BEEN TREATED INTIMATING IT AS THE JUST THEN DEAREST WISH OF HIS HEART TO HAVE THE HANDLING OF THE MAN WHO HAD PLAYED ME THE TRICK
AND THAT MOMENT AS FRESHLY NOW AS IF THE AFFAIR HAD HAPPENED LAST NIGHT THE DEAD MAN LYING IN THE CRUSHED GRASS HIS ARMS THROWN OUT HELPLESSLY ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE GLOOM OF THE TREES ALL AROUND
YES I AM CERTAINLY INCLINED TO AGREE WITH YOU NOW WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MY PRECISE IDEA REPLIED MISTER LINDSEY IT'S JUST THIS MICHAEL CARSTAIRS AND MARTIN SMEATON
AND IF THEY WERE STILL LURKING ABOUT AND WATCHING ME FROM THE BRUSHWOOD AND I MADE AN EFFORT AND BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED ONE OF THE NERVELESS HANDS IT WAS STIFFENED ALREADY
AYE AND ISN'T GOLD ONE OF THE HEAVIEST IT'LL NOT BE LEAD THAT'S IN HERE AND LOOK YOU AT THAT HE POINTED TO SOME NEATLY ADDRESSED LABELS TACKED STRONGLY TO EACH LID
MERCY ON US HE LET OUT WHAT'S ALL THIS THE MAN'S LYING DEAD DEAD ENOUGH CHISHOLM SAID I GRADUALLY GETTING THE BETTER OF MY FRIGHT AND MURDERED TOO
AND WHEN THE POLICEMEN INVITED ME TO FEEL THE WEIGHT I WAS PUT IN MIND IN A LESSER DEGREE OF GILVERTHWAITE'S OAK CHEST WHAT DO YOU THINK'S LIKE TO BE IN THERE NOW MISTER HUGH ASKED CHISHOLM
AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THIS POCKET BOOK WITH WHAT WAS IN IT THEY WERE AFTER AND NOT TROUBLING ABOUT HIS PURSE AT ALL THEY MADE SURE OF HIM ANYWAY SAID I AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM WHERE THEY HAD LAID THE BODY
YOU'RE NOT IN ANY DANGER THAT I KNOW OF HE LOOKED AT ME AS IF WONDERING WHETHER I WASN'T TRYING A JOKE ON HIM
NOTHING AND NOBODY I SAID WELL SAID HE WE'LL HAVE TO GET HIM AWAY FROM THIS YOU'LL HAVE TO GET HELP HE WENT ON TURNING TO THE CONSTABLE FETCH SOME MEN TO HELP US CARRY HIM
WOULD MISTER GILVERTHWAITE KNOW WHO THE MAN WAS WAS HE THE MAN I OUGHT TO HAVE MET OR HAD THAT MAN BEEN THERE WITNESSED THE MURDER AND GONE AWAY FRIGHTENED TO STOP WHERE THE MURDER HAD BEEN DONE OR
THAT HE WAS CERTAINLY IN LIVERPOOL
AND HAD AS LIKE AS NOT BEEN TRAMPING IT OVER PLODDEN FIELD AND THAT HISTORIC CORNER OF THE COUNTRY AND HAD BECOME BENIGHTED ERE HE COULD REACH WHEREVER HIS HEADQUARTERS WERE AND I WAS NOT GOING TO BRING SUSPICION
IT SEEMED ALL WRONG SOMEHOW AND ALL RIGHT IN ANOTHER WAY AND HOWEVER BADLY PUT IT WAS IT EXPRESSED MY MEANING SO I HANDED IT IN AND MY BORROWED SOVEREIGN WITH IT
WHEN I THOUGHT OF WHAT MAISIE AND MY MOTHER MUST HAVE SUFFERED AFTER HEARING HIS TALES AND EXCUSES BUT I DID NOT WANT HIM TO KNOW I WAS SAFE I DID NOT WANT THE TOWN TO KNOW
AND YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF YOUR BROTHER'S HAVING BEEN SEEN IN LIVERPOOL OF LATE HE WENT ON NEVER HEARD THAT HE CALLED TO SEE ANY OLD FRIENDS AT ALL
NOW THEN HALT AND KEEP HALTING IF YOU MOVE ONE FINGER MONEYLAWS OUT FLY YOUR BRAINS NO GREAT LOSS TO THE COMMUNITY MY LAD BUT I'VE SOME USE FOR THEM YET
AND I NEVER REMEMBER SEEING HIM BUT ONCE WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM DRIVING IN THE TOWN A VERY VERY OLD MAN WHO LOOKED LIKE WHAT HE REALLY WAS A HERMIT HE HAD BEEN A WIDOWER FOR MANY LONG YEARS
HE ASKED ME IF I COULD RECOMMEND HIM A BROKER HERE IN EDINBURGH
AND SHE GRIPPED ME TIGHTER YOU'RE NOT BY YOURSELF HUGH SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY YOU'RE IN NO DANGER BUT JUST THEN CHISHOLM CALLED UP THE STAIR OF THE TURRET ASKING
I WAS NUMBED AND SHIVERING WITH COLD BUT I WAS ALIVE AND SAFE THAT SQUARE YARD OF GOOD AND SOLID WOOD WAS AS MUCH TO ME AS IF IT HAD BEEN A FLOATING ISLAND AND AS THE LIGHT GREW AND GREW
THEY WERE NOT LIKE TO HAVE LEFT THAT THEN I WONDERED IF I HAD DISTURBED THE MURDERERS IT WAS FIXED IN ME FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ONE IN AT THIS DREADFUL GAME
AS HE PROBABLY WAS IN HIS LIFE AND THOUGHTS ANYWAY THERE WAS AN UNDENIABLE AN EXTRAORDINARY SIMILARITY AND EVEN MISTER PORTLETHORPE HAD TO ADMIT THAT IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THERE
HE THREW OFF HIS IMPATIENCE AND IRRITABILITY AND BECAME INTERESTED AND GRAVE THAT'S VERY STRANGE AND UNCOMMONLY IMPORTANT LINDSEY HE SAID I
WE WERE ALL PACKED PRETTY TIGHTLY IN THE BIG ROOM OF THE INN WHEN THE CORONER OPENED HIS INQUIRY AND AT THE VERY ONSET OF THE PROCEEDINGS HE MADE A REMARK WHICH WAS EXPECTED BY ALL OF US THAT KNEW HOW THESE THINGS ARE DONE
WAS TO GIVE A PEEVISH GLANCE AT THE LETTER AND THEN PUSH IT ASIDE WITH AN EQUALLY PEEVISH EXCLAMATION
I ANSWERED WHERE SIR PANAMA HE EXCLAIMED WITH A JERK OF HIS HEAD PANAMA JUST THAT IT BEGAN A LONG WAY OFF PANAMA AS FAR AS I SEE IT AND WHAT DID BEGIN AND WHAT WAS GOING ON
WHICH HAD BELONGED FOR MANY A GENERATION TO THE OLD FAMILY OF CARSTAIRS ITS LAST PROPRIETOR SIR ALEXANDER CARSTAIRS SIXTH BARONET HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF A RECLUSE
THAT'S ABOUT IT PORTLETHORPE THEN IN THAT CASE THAT YOUNG FELLOW AT DUNDEE IS MICHAEL CARSTAIRS SON EXCLAIMED MISTER PORTLETHORPE
AND I HAD CERTAINLY NEVER BEEN SO THANKFUL FOR ANYTHING AS FOR HER SOLID AND DIRTY DECK WHEN WILLING AND KINDLY HANDS HELPED ME UP ON IT HALF AN HOUR AFTER THAT WITH DRY CLOTHES ON ME AND HOT COFFEE AND RUM INSIDE ME
THEY'RE VERY SIMPLE AND QUITE OF AN ORDINARY NATURE SIR GILBERT CARSTAIRS CAME IN HERE INTRODUCING HIMSELF SOME MONTHS AGO HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS INTENDING TO SELL OFF A GOOD DEAL OF THE CARSTAIRS PROPERTY AND THAT HE WANTED TO REINVEST HIS PROCEEDS
WE PUT SILENCE BETWEEN US AS IF WE WERE SHUTTING A DOOR SO THE INCIDENT FELL INTO OBLIVION WAS IT EVER ANYTHING HAD IT EVER OCCURRED
AMEN THE DOCTOR STANDING UP PALE RAISED HIS HAND TO HEAVEN SAYING KNEEL DOWN THEY WAVERED
ROBERT LORD FERRERS OF CHARTLY
TO SEE TO SEE WHAT NOTHING WHO CAN TELL EVEN TO BE OPPOSITE THE GATE THROUGH WHICH GWYNPLAINE HAD DISAPPEARED WAS SOMETHING
THESE MONKEYS RAISED IN THE SCALE WERE A COUNTERPOISE TO MEN BRUTALIZED AND BESTIALIZED THIS PROMISCUOUSNESS OF MAN AND BEAST DESIRED BY THE GREAT

WORE LEATHER SLEEVES TO SAVE THEIR LACE BREASTPLATES OF LEATHER TO PROTECT THEIR RUFFLES
ANY ONE APPROACHING THE VESSEL'S MOORINGS WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED A BISCAYAN HOOKER THE SUN CONCEALED ALL DAY BY THE MIST HAD JUST SET
SHE CRIED FOR HER BED FELLOW BUT GWYNPLAINE BECOME RESTLESS BECAUSE HE HAD BEGUN TO LOVE DECIDED TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS FROM THAT TIME HE ALWAYS SLEPT BY THE SIDE OF URSUS ON THE PLANKS IN THE SUMMER
AS FOR THE PLACE IN THE ADMIRALTY BARKILPHEDRO OWED IT TO JOSIANA BY JOVE A PRETTY APPOINTMENT JOSIANA HAD MADE BARKILPHEDRO WHAT HE WAS SHE HAD CREATED HIM BE IT SO YES CREATED
THIS MESSAGE ADDRESSED TO JUSTICE HAS BEEN FAITHFULLY DELIVERED BY THE SEA THE SHERIFF INCREASED THE MAJESTY OF HIS TONES AND CONTINUED IN THE SAME WAY THAT HARROW HILL PRODUCES EXCELLENT WHEAT
THIS JUXTAPOSITION IS AUTHENTICATED BY A MASS OF DOMESTIC RECORDS NOTABLY BY THE PORTRAIT OF JEFFREY HUDSON DWARF OF HENRIETTA OF FRANCE
SHE WAS A SKIN DEEP PAPIST HER CATHOLICISM DID NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT NECESSARY FOR FASHION
PRISONS DO NOT OPEN TO THOSE WHO WISH TO ENTER ANY MORE THAN TO THOSE WHO DESIRE TO GET OUT THEIR HINGES NEVER TURN EXCEPT BY LAW URSUS KNEW THIS
THE DOCTOR APPROACHED AND DRAWING FROM THE POCKET OF HIS ROBE A LITTLE MIRROR OF STEEL PUT IT TO THE OPEN MOUTH OF HARDQUANONNE THEN WITH HIS FINGERS HE OPENED THE EYELIDS THEY DID NOT CLOSE AGAIN
IN WHICH THE LOWER ENTRANCE TO THE PRISON WAS SITUATED JUST AS HE ENTERED IT HE HEARD ONE STROKE OF THE CLOCK THEN A SECOND HOLD THOUGHT HE CAN IT BE MIDNIGHT ALREADY
IN HEREFORDSHIRE WITH ITS STRONG EMBATTLED KEEP

URSUS ADMIRED HOMO ONE ADMIRES ONE'S LIKE IT IS A LAW TO BE ALWAYS RAGING INWARDLY AND GRUMBLING OUTWARDLY WAS THE NORMAL CONDITION OF URSUS
DOUBTING HE YET PERSEVERED TWO OR THREE TIMES THE LITTLE INFANT CRIED THEN HE ADOPTED IN HIS GAIT A ROCKING MOVEMENT AND THE CHILD WAS SOOTHED AND SILENCED
ALTHOUGH A FOREIGNER WINCHESTER TERMED FIRST AND SOLE MARQUIS OF ENGLAND AS ASTORGA WAS TERMED SOLE MARQUIS OF SPAIN WAS ABSENT BEING A JACOBITE
TO THOSE TO WHOM SILENCE HAS BECOME DREADFUL A HOWL IS COMFORTING THAT FIERCE GROWL REASSURED HIM THAT THREAT WAS A PROMISE THERE WAS THERE A BEING ALIVE AND AWAKE
THE FLAKES OF SNOW FALLING ON HIM HAD SPRINKLED HIM WITH WHITE TEARS AND MADE HIM VISIBLE ON THE BACKGROUND OF DARKNESS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SPEAKING STATUE OF THE SHADOW THE DOCTOR MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS AND RAISED HIS VOICE
VERY VARIED IN ITS APPLICATIONS IT FASHIONED BEINGS THE LAW OF WHOSE EXISTENCE WAS HIDEOUSLY SIMPLE IT PERMITTED THEM TO SUFFER AND COMMANDED THEM TO AMUSE
THAT WHICH HE LOST WAS NOT THROWN AWAY BUT WAS GAINED BY HER HE FOUND OUT THAT THE POOR INFANT ENJOYED THE COMFORT WHICH WAS TO HER THE RENEWAL OF LIFE HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE
GWYNPLAINE WAS THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS WHAT A MARVELLOUS PHENOMENON THERE WAS AN UPROAR THROUGH ALL THE CARAVANS THE MOUNTEBANKS ENTHUSIASTIC AND EXASPERATED LOOKED AT GWYNPLAINE AND GNASHED THEIR TEETH
GOOD SAID THE DOCTOR THE LOW HOOD OF THE COMPANION ON WHICH HE LEANT HIS ELBOWS MADE A SORT OF TABLE THE DOCTOR TOOK FROM HIS POCKET HIS INKHORN AND PEN AND HIS POCKET BOOK OUT OF WHICH HE DREW A PARCHMENT
BENDING UNDER HIS BURDEN NOT KNOWING WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HIM THIS LITTLE INFANT WAS THE DROP CAUSING THE CUP OF DISTRESS TO OVERFLOW HE ADVANCED REELING AT EVERY STEP AS IF ON A SPRING BOARD

RELINQUISHED THE HALF DISDAINFUL RESERVE WITH WHICH HE HAD ENTERED AND TOOK PAINS HE DREW THE MAN IN QUESTION EN SILHOUETTE WITH A HOSTILE TOUCH SO SURE AN IRONY SO LIGHT THAT HIS SUCCESS WAS INSTANT AND GREAT
JACOB DELAFIELD HELD HER HAND CLOSE IN HIS AND WHEN AT LAST THE SOUNDS HAD DIED IN THE DISTANCE HE LIFTED IT TO HIS LIPS YOU KNOW THAT I AM YOUR FRIEND AND SERVANT HE SAID IN A QUEER MUFFLED VOICE YOU PROMISED I SHOULD BE
LADY HENRY ROSE FROM HER SEAT LEANING ON HER STICK SURELY NO OLD FACE WAS EVER MORE FORMIDABLE MORE WITHERING THAT WHATEVER AMBITIONS YOU MAY CHERISH
PROVIDED MY GUESTS WITH REFRESHMENT I THANK YOU I TRUST MY SERVANTS HAVE GIVEN YOU SATISFACTION GENTLEMEN SHE TURNED TO THE REST OF THE COMPANY WHO STOOD STUPEFIED
HIS MOUTH TWITCHED WITH REPRESSED LAUGHTER BUT DOCTOR MEREDITH DID NOT LAUGH
FEELING AND EXCITEMENT HAD BLANCHED HER NO LESS THAN LADY HENRY BUT HER FINE HEAD AND DELICATE FORM BREATHED A WILL SO PROUD A DIGNITY SO PASSIONATE THAT LADY HENRY SHRANK BEFORE HER
AND WHILE THE APPLAUDING LAUGHTER OF THE GROUP OF INTIMATES AMID WHICH HE SAT TOLD HIM THAT HIS EPIGRAMS HAD BEEN GOOD HE HAPPENED TO RAISE HIS EYES TOWARDS THE DISTANT SETTEE WHERE JULIE LE BRETON WAS SITTING
THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH WELL DOWN THE LOOK STRAIGHT AND DARING THE LADY HENRY OF THE PICTURE A BRIDE OF NINETEEN WAS ALREADY FORMIDABLE AND THE OLD WOMAN SITTING BENEATH IT WITH THE STRONG WHITE HAIR WHICH
FOUND HIMSELF FLOATING ON A STREAM OF TALK WHICH JULIE LED FIRST INTO ONE CHANNEL AND THEN INTO ANOTHER AS SHE PLEASED AND ALL TO THE FLATTERY AND GLORIFICATION OF THE TALKER
ABOUT NO DOUBT TO SAY GOOD BYE BUT VERY CLEARLY LOATH TO SAY IT THEY WERE INDEED IN EARNEST CONVERSATION THE CAPTAIN SPOKE WITH EAGERNESS MADEMOISELLE JULIE WITH DOWNCAST EYES SMILED AND LISTENED
THESE ENGLISHWOMEN OVERDO THEIR JEWELS HE THOUGHT WITH DISTASTE BUT THEY OVERDO EVERYTHING THAT IS A HANDSOME FELLOW BY THE WAY WHO WAS WITH LA PETITE FEE WHEN WE ARRIVED
I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY HEART FOR IT SHE SAID SADLY AND THEN AS LADY HENRY SAT SILENT SHE APPROACHED YOU LOOK VERY TIRED SHALL I SEND YOUR MAID
FOR ALL THE LATTER PART OF HER LIFE SHE HAD BEEN HALF A MYSTIC AND HALF A GREAT LADY SECRETLY HATING THE LUXURY FROM WHICH SHE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO FREE HERSELF DRESSING CEREMONIOUSLY AS THE DUCHESS HAD SAID FOR A SOLITARY DINNER AND ALL THE WHILE GOING IN SORE REMEMBRANCE OF A MASTER WHO HAD NOT WHERE TO LAY HIS HEAD
LADY HENRY MOTIONED TOWARDS THE DOOR JACOB HESITATED THEN QUIETLY TOOK HIS DEPARTURE HE THREW JULIE A LOOK OF ANXIOUS APPEAL AS HE WENT OUT BUT SHE DID NOT SEE IT
WHAT CAN AN OLD BLIND CREATURE LIKE ME DO TO STOP IT AND AS JACOB'S WIFE THE WIFE PERHAPS OF THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY YOU STILL MEAN TO QUARREL WITH HER
AND WAS SOON ON LADY HENRY'S DOORSTEP HER LADYSHIP IS IN THE DINING ROOM SAID THE BUTLER AND SIR WILFRID WAS USHERED THERE STRAIGHT GOOD MORNING WILFRID SAID THE OLD LADY RAISING HERSELF ON HER SILVER HEADED STICKS AS HE ENTERED
SHE WAS NOW WHITE TO THE LIPS WHOEVER GOES WITH HER GIVES ME UP THEY MUST CHOOSE
THIS MORNING CAME YOUR NOTE ABOUT ELEVEN IT WAS ANGELIC TO THINK SO KINDLY AND THOUGHTFULLY OF A FRIEND ANGELIC TO WRITE SUCH A LETTER AT SUCH A TIME YOU ANNOUNCED YOUR FLIGHT TO CROWBOROUGH HOUSE BUT DID NOT SAY WHEN SO I CREPT TO BRUTON STREET
AND AN INFERIOR LADY HENRY NODDED GRIMLY IT IS TRUE SHE SAID INTERRUPTING I WAS NOT ABLE TO TAKE YOUR ROMANTIC VIEW OF THE OFFICE OF COMPANION YOU NEED ONLY HAVE TAKEN A HUMAN VIEW
AND JACOB THE DIRECTOR OF THE FRENCH FOREIGN OFFICE SAID MONTRESOR IN AN ASIDE TO THE DUCHESS
AS LADY HENRY HERSELF WOULD HAVE TALKED TO MUCH BETTER EFFECT HAD SHE BEEN PRESENT THE GENERAL GAVE HER A GRAVE AND FRIENDLY ATTENTION FEW MEN HAD DONE STERNER OR MORE DARING FEATS IN THE FIELD YET HERE HE SAT
AT THE WORN MONOGRAM IN THE CORNERS OF THE SHEETS AT THE LITTLE BAGS OF LAVENDER AND POT POURRI RANGED ALONG THE SHELVES SUDDENLY JULIE TURNED AWAY AND SAT DOWN BY AN OPEN WINDOW
FOR SHE WAS NOT ONLY TOO CLEVER FOR THEIR TEACHING AND AN INBORN SCEPTIC BUT WHEREVER SHE APPEARED SHE PRODUCED PARTIES AND THE PASSIONS OF PARTIES AND THOUGH AS SHE GREW OLDER SHE SHOWED MUCH ADROITNESS IN MANAGING THOSE WHO WERE HOSTILE TO HER SHE WAS NEVER WITHOUT ENEMIES
HE WAS AT ANY TIME READY TO TAKE BACK HIS WIFE SO FAR AS THE PROTECTION OF HIS NAME AND ROOF WERE CONCERNED SHOULD SHE PENITENTLY RETURN TO HIM SO THE CHILD THAT WAS PRESENTLY BORN TO LADY ROSE COULD NOT BE LEGITIMIZED
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR TWENTY YEARS THAT I HAVE NOT FOUND HER ON A WEDNESDAY EVENING HE SAID WITH A SUDDEN TOUCH OF FEELING WHICH BECAME HIM AT OUR AGE THE SMALLEST BREAK IN THE OLD HABIT HE SIGHED
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WAS TRAPPED WE BOTH DESIRED TO COME TO CLOSE QUARTERS ANYWAY SHE SOON SHOWED ME BOOKS LETTERS FROM LADY ROSE FROM DALRYMPLE LORD LACKINGTON THE EVIDENCE WAS COMPLETE VERY WELL I SAID
THE FRENCHMAN FEELING HIMSELF AMONG COMRADES WORTHY OF HIS STEEL
FOR THEY WERE BOTH IN UNIFORM AND THE GENERAL WAS RESPLENDENT WITH STARS AND MEDALS
AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE TOO WAS GONE DOCTOR MEREDITH AND GENERAL FERGUS STOOD BESIDE HER THE GENERAL HAD A KEEN SENSE OF HUMOR AND AS HE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THIS UNLAWFUL HOSTESS WHOSE PLIGHT HE UNDERSTOOD NO MORE THAN HIS OWN
UNLESS INDEED IF IT CAME TO THIS THAT ONE MUST THINK NO MORE OF LOVE BUT ONLY OF POWER WHY THEN A RING AT THE DOOR RESOUNDING THROUGH THE QUIET SIDE STREET
YOU GAVE ME A FEW HINTS LAST NIGHT SAID SIR WILFRID HESITATING LADY HENRY PUSHED HER CHAIR BACK FROM THE TABLE HER HANDS TREMBLED ON HER STICK HINTS SHE SAID SCORNFULLY
AND THOUGH SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH GREAT COOLNESS THE CIRCLE ROUND HER NOW AUGMENTED BY DOCTOR MEREDITH AND ANOTHER POLITICIAN OR TWO WAS RECONSTITUTED AND PRESENTLY WITH A CONSCIOUS EFFORT
WE MEANT NO HARM SHE SAID COLDLY IT ALL CAME ABOUT VERY SIMPLY A FEW PEOPLE CAME IN TO INQUIRE AFTER YOU I REGRET THEY SHOULD HAVE STAYED TALKING SO LONG
OF HAVING HER BAPTIZED STRAIGHTWAY INTO THE CATHOLIC FAITH AND SHE MADE HER PREMIERE COMMUNION IN THEIR CHURCH IN THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS SHE BECAME A REMARKABLE GIRL THE SOURCE OF MANY ANXIETIES TO THE NUNS
OH YES MURMURED SIR WILFRID IF YOU WANT TO DISMISS HER WE SHALL COME TO THAT PRESENTLY SAID LADY HENRY SHORTLY IMAGINE PLEASE
IN THE DIRECTION OF HER AUNT'S HOUSE THEN WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST WARNING EXCEPT ONE SHRILL HOOT FROM OVERHEAD A NUMBER OF THINGS HAPPENED A GREAT SHADOW WHIRLED ACROSS THE SUNLIGHT AT HER FEET A SOUND OF RENDING TORE THE AIR
WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH THE PRESS COME UP HERE TO ME AT ONCE YOU MUST BE PRESENT CAN YOU HEAR OH YES COME THEN AT ONCE IT WILL BE THE GREATEST THING IN HISTORY TELL NO ONE COME BEFORE THE RUSH BEGINS IN HALF AN HOUR THE WAY WILL BE STOPPED OLIVER
MABEL WATCHED HIM AS HE TOUCHED A BUTTON MENTIONED HIS NAME AND PUT HIS EAR TO THE OPENING IT IS SNOWFORD'S SECRETARY HE SAID ABRUPTLY TO THE TWO EXPECTANT FACES SNOWFORD WANTS TO AH
HE SEEMED MOVED AT SOMETHING AND MABEL LOOKED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT IT IS NOT EASTERN NEWS SHE ASKED HIS EYEBROWS WRINKLED A LITTLE
HER LIPS MOVED AND THAT DEADLY PALENESS LAY ON HER CHEEKS HE GRIPPED HER FIRMLY LISTEN HE SAID YOU MUST FACE IT IT IS OVER ROME IS GONE NOW WE MUST BUILD SOMETHING BETTER
OF HALF HER CATHOLIC POPULATION FOR THAT ISLAND AND HAD CONSISTENTLY WITH HER COMMUNIST COLONIAL POLICY GRANTED EVERY FACILITY FOR INDIVIDUALISM TO REDUCE ITSELF THERE AD ABSURDUM
HE PULLED OUT HIS WATCH WITH HIS DISENGAGED HAND IT IS NOT YET ONE HE SAID VERY WELL LISTEN FATHER I WAS IN THIS HOUSE AND I HEARD THAT TALKING AND I RAN ALONG THE PASSAGES TILL I SAW LIGHT BELOW A DOOR
THAT THE WHISPER OF THE HEART WAS UNHEARD THE DESIRES FOR EARTHLY PEACE SO FIERCE THAT SUPERNATURAL AMBITIONS WERE SILENCED SO DENSE WAS THE GLOOM THAT HOPING AGAINST HOPE BELIEVING AGAINST KNOWLEDGE
THE LOOK OF FRANTIC HORROR PASSED SLOWLY OUT OF HER EYES GIVING WAY TO ACUTE MISERY AS HE TALKED AND AS HIS PERSONALITY ONCE MORE BEGAN TO DOMINATE HER OWN BUT IT WAS NOT YET OVER BUT THE VOLORS SHE CRIED THE VOLORS
YET SHE COULD NOT BUT RECOGNISE THAT CATASTROPHE SEEMED ONE OF NATURE'S METHODS SHE SAT VERY QUIET GLANCING ONCE OR TWICE AT THE MEAGRE LITTLE SCRAP OF NEWS
AND A FEW MORE BARRACK LIKE HOUSES HAD BEEN ADDED HERE AND THERE TO THE OBSCURE VILLAGES IN SIGHT BUT IT WAS VERY MUCH AS IT HAD BEEN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE PLAIN WAS HALF SHADOWED BY CARMEL AND HALF IN DUSTY GOLDEN LIGHT
HOLY FATHER THE MASS PRAYER THE ROSARY THESE FIRST AND LAST THE WORLD DENIES THEIR POWER IT IS ON THEIR POWER THAT CHRISTIANS MUST THROW ALL THEIR WEIGHT ALL THINGS IN JESUS CHRIST IN JESUS CHRIST FIRST AND LAST NOTHING ELSE CAN AVAIL
AFTER THE DISCOURSE HE SAID IT IS THIS THAT WILL NEED SPECIAL MARSHALLING I SUPPOSE NO REHEARSAL WILL BE POSSIBLE SCARCELY SAID OLIVER SMILING THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES SIGHED I FEARED NOT
THE BURNING CHURCHES AND CONVENTS ALL STREAMED OUT INCOHERENT BROKEN BY SOBS DETAILS OF HORROR LAMENTATIONS REPROACHES INTERPRETED BY THE WRITHING OF HER HEAD AND HANDS UPON HIS KNEES THE COLLAPSE WAS COMPLETE
INTO THE OLD LADY'S HAND AND HERSELF BENT FORWARD TO LISTEN OLD MISSUS BRAND LOOKED AT THAT TOO KNOWING THAT IT WAS AN ANALYSIS OF HER SON'S SPEECH AND AWARE THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HEAR HIS WORDS
THERE IN THE NEXT ROOM WAS A LITTLE WOODEN ALTAR AND ABOVE IT AN IRON BOX AND WITHIN THAT BOX A SILVER CUP AND WITHIN THAT CUP SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
AND ACCOUNTED FOR HIM IN HIS ESSENTIAL NATURE FURTHER HE SAW WELL ENOUGH THAT THE FAILURE OF CHRISTIANITY TO UNITE ALL MEN ONE TO ANOTHER RESTED NOT UPON ITS FEEBLENESS BUT ITS STRENGTH ITS LINES MET IN ETERNITY
TO CLAIM HIS RIGHTS AND MEANWHILE USED HIS LEGATES FOR THE IMPORTANT WORK
THE DELICIOUS OAK FRAMED PAINTINGS THE DEEP SPRING SEATS THE MELLOW GLOBES OVERHEAD THAT POURED OUT RADIANCE AT A MOTHER AND CHILD DIAGONALLY OPPOSITE HER THEN THE GREAT CHORD SOUNDED THE FAINT VIBRATION INCREASED EVER SO SLIGHTLY
SHE SAID THEN SHE BROKE OFF AND SAT BACK WHY DID HE SHOOT JUST THEN SHE ASKED OLIVER TURNED HIS EYES FOR AN INSTANT TOWARDS HIS MOTHER BUT SHE WAS KNITTING TRANQUILLY THEN HE ANSWERED WITH A CURIOUS DELIBERATENESS
AND THIS WAS THE MAN THOUGHT PERCY PAPA ANGELICUS WHOM HE WAS TO SEE IN A MINUTE OR TWO THE CARDINAL PUT HIS HAND ON THE PRIEST'S KNEE AS THE DOOR OPENED AND A PURPLE PRELATE APPEARED BOWING
IN HIS MASONIC INSIGNIA IT WAS HE WHO HAD GIVEN IMMENSE IMPETUS TO THAT SECRET MOVEMENT BY HIS DECLARATION IN THE HOUSE THAT THE KEY OF FUTURE PROGRESS AND BROTHERHOOD OF NATIONS WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE ORDER
HE HAD SEEN FROM HIS WINDOWS IN WHITEHALL PARLIAMENT SQUARE FILLED WITH A MOB THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NOT BEEN KNOWN IN ENGLAND SINCE THE DAYS OF CHRISTIANITY A MOB FULL OF A FURY THAT COULD SCARCELY DRAW ITS ORIGIN
SHE RAISED HERSELF A LITTLE IN BED AGAIN GLANCING ROUND THE ROOM THEN SHE PUT OUT HER OLD RINGED HAND FOR ONE OF HIS AND HE GAVE IT WONDERING
OF COURSE NOT MY DARLING WHAT IS IT WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE EFFECT HE RAISED HIMSELF A LITTLE LOOKING OUT AS USUAL THROUGH THE DARKENING WINDOWS ON TO THAT ASTONISHING VIEW
SO FAR AT LEAST AS HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WAS CONCERNED AND THAT WAS HIS MEDITATION HE HAD TRAVELLED FAR IN THE MYSTICAL LIFE SINCE HIS AGONIES OF EFFORT NOW HE USED NO DELIBERATE DESCENTS INTO THE SPIRITUAL WORLD HE THREW AS IT WERE HIS HANDS OVER HIS HEAD
I TAKE IT THAT IT IS HOMAGE OFFERED TO LIFE SAID THE OTHER SLOWLY LIFE UNDER FOUR ASPECTS MATERNITY CORRESPONDS TO CHRISTMAS AND THE CHRISTIAN FABLE IT IS THE FEAST OF HOME LOVE
FLARED OUT MONSTROUS LETTERS OF FIRE TELLING IN ESPERANTO AND ENGLISH THE MESSAGE FOR WHICH ENGLAND HAD GROWN SICK HE READ IT A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE HE MOVED STARING
AGAIN CAME THE CRYING OF VOICES AGAIN THE SIGNALS AND ONCE MORE A CAR WHIRLED PAST FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY ANOTHER THERE WAS A JERK A SMOOTH MOVEMENT PERCY STAGGERED AND FELL INTO A SEAT
AT LEAST IN THE CATHEDRALS AND PRINCIPAL TOWNS IT IS IMPORTANT HE SAID THAT THIS SHOULD BE DONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IT IS VERY NECESSARY TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION THERE ARE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE THE INSTINCT OF WORSHIP
PUTTING AN OCCASIONAL QUESTION BUT LISTENING THROUGHOUT WITH GREAT ATTENTION AND YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS FATHER HE HAD SAID AND THEN INTERRUPTED HIMSELF NO THAT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK THE HOLY FATHER WILL SPEAK OF THAT
HE ALLOWED NO MAN UNDER THE AGE OF FIFTY TO LIVE WITHIN ITS WALLS FOR MORE THAN ONE MONTH IN EACH YEAR EXCEPT THOSE WHO RECEIVED HIS PERMIT THEY MIGHT LIVE OF COURSE IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE CITY
AT HIS SECOND TAP THE DOOR OPENED AND THE CARDINAL CAME OUT TAKING HIM BY THE ARM WITHOUT A WORD AND TOGETHER THEY TURNED TO THE LIFT ENTRANCE
THAT THEY WERE ALREADY IN THE TUNNEL THE STOPPAGE MIGHT ARISE FROM MANY CAUSES AND HE WAS NOT GREATLY EXCITED NOR DID IT SEEM THAT OTHERS IN THE CARRIAGE TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY HE COULD HEAR AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE THE TALKING RECOMMENCE BEYOND THE PARTITION
BY HER HANDS WHICH HE STILL HELD HE DREW HER NEARER YET TO HIMSELF SWEETHEART HE SAID GRAVELY CANNOT YOU TRUST ME A LITTLE IF I COULD TELL YOU ALL THAT PASSED TO DAY
SO ABRUPTLY THAT CARDINAL MARTIN SPRANG UP TOO APPREHENSIVE AND TERRIFIED IT SEEMED THAT THIS YOUNG MAN HAD GONE TOO FAR THEN THE POPE SAT DOWN AGAIN EXTENDING HIS HAND GOD BLESS YOU MY SON YOU HAVE LEAVE TO GO
HER WHOLE POINT SO TO SPEAK LAY IN THE DELICATE LITTLE FABRIC OF PERSONALITY BUILT OUT OF FRAGILE THINGS INTO AN ENTITY FAR MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THE SUM OF ITS COMPONENT PARTS THE DEATH OF A FLOWER REFLECTED MABEL IS SADDER THAN THE DEATH OF A LION
IN THE FRONT RANK OF A CROWD THAT WAS SWAYING AND CRYING OUT
SHE WAS WATCHING THOSE STRANGE EMBLEMS STRAINING HER EYES THROUGH THE DUSK STRIVING TO DISTINGUISH THE BATTERED BROKEN SHAPES HALF GUESSING YET AFRAID TO GUESS THEN ON A SUDDEN FROM THE HIDDEN LAMPS BENEATH THE EAVES LIGHT LEAPED INTO BEING
ONLY FROM OUTSIDE NOW AND AGAIN SOUNDED THE CLANG OF THE CARS AS THEY SPED COUNTRYWARDS AGAIN FROM THE CONGESTED TOWN AND ONCE THE SOUND OF GREAT SHOUTING HE WONDERED WHAT TIME IT WAS
THERE WERE THEREFORE AT THIS MOMENT TWELVE PERSONS IN THE WORLD WHO CONSTITUTED THE SACRED COLLEGE TWO ENGLISHMEN OF WHOM CORKRAN WAS ONE TWO AMERICANS A FRENCHMAN A GERMAN AN ITALIAN A SPANIARD A POLE
IT WILL KEEP OUT ALL DANGER OF SUPERSTITION MISTER FRANCIS TURNED ON HIM ABRUPTLY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE POPE'S NEW RELIGIOUS ORDER SIR
STARTING ALONG BRISKLY JUST AS IF HE WAS GOING TO HURRY RIGHT HOME AND BEGIN WORK THAT VERY INSTANT BUT HALF AN HOUR LATER WHEN MISTER SKUNK HAPPENED TO PASS THE HOME OF MISTER CHIPMUNK THERE SAT MISTER RABBIT WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED
FUNNY PLACE TO BUILD A HOUSE ISN'T IT JOHNNY CHUCK SCRATCHED HIS HEAD THOUGHTFULLY IT DOES SEEM A FUNNY PLACE HE ADMITTED IT CERTAINLY DOES SEEM A FUNNY PLACE BUT THEN JERRY MUSKRAT IS A FUNNY FELLOW
AND SHARE IN THE GOOD THINGS OLD MISTER POSSUM HAD TOLD ABOUT OLD MISTER POSSUM HIMSELF HURRIED ON CHUCKLING AS HE THOUGHT OF THE WAY MISTER PANTHER WAS LIKELY TO BE RECEIVED WITH OLD KING BEAR IN SUCH A TEMPER
IT'S VERY STRANGE TO ME HOW LITTLE SOME FOLKS KNOW ABOUT THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBORS HE LOOKED UP AND WINKED AT JOLLY ROUND BRIGHT MISTER SUN STRIPED CHIPMUNK JOHNNY CHUCK JIMMY SKUNK AND DANNY MEADOW MOUSE
WHY SPOTTY THE TURTLE CARRIES HIS HOUSE WITH HIM SPOTTY THE TURTLE SAT ON AN OLD LOG ON THE BANK OF THE SMILING POOL TAKING A SUN BATH HE HAD SAT THAT WAY FOR THE LONGEST TIME WITHOUT ONCE MOVING
SHE TOUCHED HIS BACK AND TURNED THE SKIN INTO HARD SHELL THEN SHE TOUCHED THE SKIN OF HIS STOMACH AND TURNED THAT INTO HARD SHELL NOW DRAW IN YOUR HEAD AND YOUR LEGS AND YOUR TAIL SAID SHE MISTER TURTLE DID AS HE WAS TOLD TO DO
WHY NOT ASKED HAPPY JACK ASK GRANDFATHER FROG HE KNOWS REPLIED OLD MISTER TOAD AND STARTED ON ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENS THAT GRANDFATHER FROG TOLD THIS STORY TO THE LITTLE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE
NOW OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD BEEN KEEPING A SHARP WATCH AS SHE ALWAYS DOES AND WHEN SHE FOUND THAT THEY WERE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO LIKE THE LAND BEST SHE DID ALL THAT SHE COULD TO MAKE THINGS COMFORTABLE FOR THEM SHE TAUGHT THEM HOW TO RUN AND JUMP AND CLIMB AND DIG
SAID JOHNNY LOOKING DREADFULLY DISAPPOINTED AND I GUESS WE'D BETTER NOT DISTURB HIM FOR HE MIGHT WAKE UP CROSS AND OF COURSE WE WOULDN'T GET A STORY IF HE DID PETER LOOKED AT GRANDFATHER FROG SHARPLY HE WASN'T SO SURE THAT THAT WAS A REAL NAP
AS I SAID BEFORE THE IMP OF MISCHIEF SEEMED TO BE IN OLD MISTER POSSUM'S HEAD THAT MORNING FOR HE BEGAN TO PLAY TRICKS ON HIS NEIGHBORS AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF BED HE HID OLD KING BEAR'S BREAKFAST WHILE THE LATTER HAD HIS HEAD TURNED
THE OTHERS CAME DROPPING IN EACH LICKING HIS CHOPS
MISTER MOLE SPENT ALL HIS TIME IN HIS TUNNELS AND SELDOM PUT HIS NOSE OUTSIDE HE WAS SAFE AND HE WAS COMFORTABLE AND HE COULD ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO EAT BY DIGGING FOR IT LITTLE BY LITTLE HIS OLD NEIGHBORS FORGOT ALL ABOUT HIM
SHE ASKED MISTER MUSKRAT LOOKED VERY MUCH ASHAMED AS HE FINALLY OWNED UP THAT HE WAS ENVIOUS OF HIS COUSINS AND SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALS BECAUSE THEY HAD SUCH FINE HOUSES ON THE LAND THEN WHY DON'T YOU BUILD YOU A FINE HOUSE ON THE LAND
PETER STARED VERY HARD
GRANDFATHER FROG CLEARED HIS THROAT ONCE MORE AND WITH A FAR AWAY LOOK IN HIS GREAT GOGGLY EYES BEGAN ONCE UPON A TIME LONG LONG AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG LIVED OLD MISTER SNAKE
I TELL YOU WHAT REPLIED MISTER BADGER WE'LL HUNT TOGETHER A LITTLE LONGER AND THEN IF WE CAN'T FIND ANYTHING TO EAT WE'LL COME BACK AND I'LL HELP YOU DIG I HATE TO HURT MISTER MOLE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS MINDS HIS OWN BUSINESS
FOR UNC BILLY'S MAMMY HAD DIED LONG BEFORE HE EVEN THOUGHT OF COMING UP FROM OL VIRGINNY TO THE GREEN FOREST AND THE GREEN MEADOWS WHERE THEY LIVED HE SAID IT JUST TO TEASE THEM AND WHEN HE SAID IT HE CHUCKLED UNTIL THEY CHUCKLED TOO
CLEARED HIS THROAT AS IF TO BEGIN BUT FOR A LONG TIME HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD ONCE PETER OPENED HIS MOUTH TO ASK WHY BUT REMEMBERED IN TIME AND CLOSED IT AGAIN WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND AT LAST
AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY LITTLE MISTER GREENSNAKE CANNOT WINK AT YOU HE HASN'T ANY EYELIDS TO WINK WITH FINISHED GRANDFATHER FROG
MISTER RABBIT SNEEZED AND THIS MADE HIM WAKE UP HE YAWNED AND BLINKED AND THEN HIS EYES SUDDENLY FLEW WIDE OPEN WITH FRIGHT HE HAD DISCOVERED OLD MOTHER NATURE FROWNING AT HIM SHE POINTED A LONG FOREFINGER AT HIM AND SAID
AND HE LOOKS AS IF HE MIGHT BE FEELING VERY GOOD NATURED THIS MORNING LET'S GO ASK HIM WHY JERRY MUSKRAT BUILDS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER GRANDFATHER FROG SAW THEM COMING AND HE GUESSED RIGHT AWAY THAT THEY WERE COMING FOR A STORY
WHY CHEATING HAD BECOME SUCH A HABIT WITH HIM THAT HE ACTUALLY TRIED TO CHEAT HIMSELF TO CHEAT HIS CONSCIENCE WHEN HE WAS TELLING A LIE HE WOULD WINK ONE EYE THAT
SHOUTED HAPPY JACK I I DON'T WANT TO STAMMERED PETER YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T JEERED HAPPY JACK PETER PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR AND A FEW MINUTES LATER HE HOPPED AWAY TOWARDS THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP
AND WHEN AT LAST OLD MOTHER NATURE CAME TO SEE HOW ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE WERE GETTING ALONG SHE HEARD SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW WHERE TO BEGIN TO STRAIGHTEN MATTERS OUT SHE HAD ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE COME BEFORE HER IN TURN AND TELL THEIR TROUBLES
I HAVE A MIND NOT TO JUST TO GET EVEN WITH YOU SAID GRANDFATHER FROG SETTLING HIMSELF COMFORTABLY BUT I BELIEVE I WILL TO SHOW YOU THAT THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO CAN TAKE A JOKE WITHOUT LOSING THEIR TEMPER
NOW PETER KNEW THAT THERE MUST BE A GOOD STORY ABOUT SPOTTY AND HIS HOUSE AND YOU KNOW PETER DEARLY LOVES A GOOD STORY SO AT THE VERY FIRST OPPORTUNITY THE NEXT DAY HE HURRIED OVER TO THE SMILING POOL TO ASK GRANDFATHER FROG ABOUT IT
AND EVEN HAD ASKED UNC BILLY ABOUT IT UNC BILLY HAD JUST GRINNED AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIS MAMMY OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T DO THAT AND UNC BILLY KNEW THEY COULDN'T
OH DEAR OH DEAR WHAT SHALL I DO WAILED MISTER RABBIT WRINGING HIS HANDS GET BUSY AND CLEAN UP ADVISED MISTER WOODCHUCK HURRYING ABOUT HIS OWN WORK NOW MISTER WOODCHUCK WAS A WORKER AND VERY VERY NEAT
ONE DAY WORD CAME TO THE GREEN FOREST AND TO THE GREEN MEADOWS THAT OLD MOTHER NATURE WAS COMING TO SEE HOW ALL THE LITTLE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE WERE GETTING ALONG TO SETTLE ALL THE LITTLE TROUBLES AND FUSSES BETWEEN THEM AND TO FIND OUT WHO WERE AND WHO WERE NOT
AND THEN IT WAS THAT FEAR WAS BORN THE BIG PEOPLE LIKE OLD KING BEAR AND MISTER WOLF AND MISTER PANTHER AND MISTER LYNX BEGAN TO LOOK WITH HUNGRY EYES ON THE LITTLE PEOPLE
THEN WHENEVER OLD KING BEAR CAME NEAR THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS HIDDEN OLD MISTER POSSUM WOULD HIDE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE OLD KING BEAR WAS HUNGRY AND HE WORKED HIMSELF UP INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE
ALL THE WAY TO HIS OWN HOME IN THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH PETER THOUGHT ABOUT SPOTTY AND HOW QUEER IT WAS THAT HE SHOULD CARRY HIS HOUSE AROUND WITH HIM I WONDER HOW IT HAPPENS THAT HE DOES IT THOUGHT HE NO WONDER HE IS SO SLOW
INTERRUPTED PETER GRANDFATHER FROG SCOWLED AT PETER IF I HAVE ANY MORE INTERRUPTIONS THERE WILL BE NO STORY TO DAY SAID HE SEVERELY PETER LOOKED ASHAMED
HE HADN'T SAID A WORD TO ANY ONE ABOUT SPOTTY SO HOW COULD GRANDFATHER FROG KNOW WHAT HE HAD COME FOR FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD HAD A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR GRANDFATHER FROG WHO AS YOU KNOW IS VERY OLD AND VERY WISE
PETER NODDED HE KNEW THAT HE COULD SWIM IF HE HAD TO BUT ONLY FOR A VERY LITTLE WAY AND HE HATED THE THOUGHT OF IT NOW THERE WERE A FEW ANIMALS OF WHOM OLD MISTER MUSKRAT THE GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED OF JERRY MUSKRAT WAS ONE
I DON'T LIKE TO BE KEPT WAITING IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SPOTTY THE TURTLE WHY DIDN'T YOU COME EARLIER ALL THE TIME THERE WAS A TWINKLE IN THE BIG GOGGLY EYES OF GRANDFATHER FROG
HI SPOTTY HE SHOUTED WHERE DO YOU LIVE SPOTTY SLOWLY TURNED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED UP AT PETER THERE WAS A TWINKLE IN HIS EYES THOUGH PETER DIDN'T SEE IT RIGHT HERE IN THE SMILING POOL WHERE ELSE SHOULD I LIVE HE REPLIED
WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND STRIPED CHIPMUNK SAT STARING AT A LITTLE RIDGE WHERE THE GRASS WAS RAISED UP HE HAD OFTEN SEEN LITTLE RIDGES LIKE THAT WITHOUT THINKING MUCH ABOUT THEM HE KNEW THAT THEY WERE MADE BY MINER THE MOLE
GRANDFATHER FROG SAT JUST AS USUAL ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY PAD AND HE GRINNED WHEN HE SAW WHO HIS VISITORS WERE FOR HE GUESSED RIGHT AWAY WHAT THEY HAD COME FOR CHUG A RUM
NONE OF HIS FRIENDS ON LAND HAD SUCH A BIG FINE HOUSE AND MISTER MUSKRAT WAS VERY PROUD OF IT BUT WITH ALL HIS PRIDE HE NEVER FORGOT THAT IT WAS A REWARD FOR TRYING TO BE CONTENT WITH HIS SURROUNDINGS AND MAKING THE BEST OF THEM
THERE WAS THE GREATEST CHANGING OF CLOTHES YOU EVER DID SEE OLD KING BEAR PUT ON HIS BLACKEST COAT MISTER COON AND MISTER MINK AND MISTER OTTER SAT UP HALF THE NIGHT BRUSHING THEIR SUITS AND MAKING THEM LOOK AS FINE AND HANDSOME AS THEY COULD
OBEYING THE ORDERS SHE HAD GIVEN THEM WHEN SHE HAD VISITED THEM LAST MY MY MY SUCH A HURRYING AND SCURRYING AND WORRYING AS THERE WAS YOU SEE EVERYBODY WANTED TO LOOK HIS BEST WHEN OLD MOTHER NATURE ARRIVED YES SIR EVERYBODY WANTED TO LOOK HIS BEST
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SPAIN WAS COMPELLED SIXTEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY THE ENTRY OF THE ARMIES OF LOUIS INTO THE SOUTHERN NETHERLANDS TO DECLARE WAR UPON FRANCE AND CALLED UPON THE STATES FOR THEIR MILITARY AID OF EIGHT THOUSAND MEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE TREATY OF NIJMWEGEN
BUT IN ORDER TO GAIN BREATHING SPACE FOR THE EFFORTS OF THE NEGOTIATORS ONE THING WAS ESSENTIAL THE BREAKING OF THE BLOCKADE THE ADMIRALTIES MADE A SUPREME EFFORT TO REFIT AND REINFORCE THEIR FLEET BUT IT LAY IN TWO PORTIONS EIGHTY FIVE SAIL UNDER TROMP IN THE MAAS
AUGUST FIFTEENTH SIXTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHICH LEFT THE FRENCH KING IN POSSESSION OF ALL HIS CONQUESTS NO MORE CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF THE INFLEXIBLE RESOLVE OF WILLIAM THE THIRD CAN BE FOUND THAN THE PATIENCE HE NOW EXHIBITED HIS FAITH IN HIMSELF WAS NEVER SHAKEN
THE NEGOTIATIONS CAME TO A DEADLOCK
THE COUNCIL OF STATE ON HEARING OF THIS BEGAN ALSO TO MAKE READY FOR EVENTUALITIES NEGOTIATIONS WERE STILL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WHEN MARTIN TROMP THE VICTOR OF THE BATTLE OF THE DOWNS
NOT TILL THE DUTCH ENVOYS HAD DEMANDED THEIR PASSPORTS DID THE PROTECTOR GIVE WAY SO FAR AS TO SAY HE WOULD BE CONTENT TO HAVE THE EXCLUSION GUARANTEED BY A SECRET ARTICLE WHAT FOLLOWED FORMS ONE OF THE STRANGEST CHAPTERS IN THE HISTORY OF DIPLOMACY
THUS EARLY DID THE NEW COUNCIL PENSIONARY INITIATE A FORM OF DIPLOMACY IN WHICH HE WAS TO PROVE HIMSELF AN ADEPT THIS FIRST EFFORT WAS NOT A SUCCESS THE PARLIAMENT PUBLISHED THE LETTER WITH THE TITLE HUMBLE SUPPLICATION OF THE STATES OF HOLLAND
AND FEW COULD EVEN GUESS AT THE HIDDEN WORKINGS OF THAT SCHEMING MIND OR AT THE BURNING FIRES OF ENERGY AND WILL POWER BENEATH THE PROUD AND FRIGID RESERVE OF A MAN SO FRAIL IN BODY AND ALWAYS AILING
AND HE HAD MOREOVER BEEN AT SEA WITHOUT REPLENISHMENT OF STORES EVER SINCE THE FIGHT AT DUNGENESS WHILE THE ENGLISH HAD COME STRAIGHT FROM PORT THE FIGHT
OR COMMANDER OF MILITARY OR NAVAL FORCES
THE RIGHT OF SEARCH AND THE STRIKING OF THE FLAG THAT WERE TO BE THE REAL CAUSES OF THE OUTBREAK OF A WAR THAT WAS DESIRED BY NEITHER OF THE TWO GOVERNMENTS BUT POPULAR FEELING AND THE COURSE OF EVENTS WAS TOO STRONG FOR THEM THE NEWS OF THE SEIZURE OF THEIR VESSELS
THE SO CALLED TEMPERAMENT CLAUSE BUT CROMWELL HAD INSISTED UPON IT BY THIS ARTICLE
NOW LIEUTENANT ADMIRAL OF HOLLAND WAS SENT TO SEA WITH FIFTY SHIPS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO PROTECT DUTCH MERCHANTMEN FROM INTERFERENCE AND TO SEE THAT THE STATES SUFFERED NO AFFRONT NOTHING WAS ACTUALLY SAID ABOUT THE STRIKING OF THE FLAG
WITH A GRANT OF ONE THIRTY THIRD OF ITS DIVIDENDS
FULL OF RESENTMENT THOUGH HE WAS AT THE BAD TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED TROMP WAS TOO GOOD A PATRIOT TO REFUSE AT THE END OF NOVEMBER THE OLD ADMIRAL AT THE HEAD OF ONE HUNDRED WARSHIPS PUT TO SEA FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONVOYING SOME FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MERCHANTMEN THROUGH THE STRAITS
THAT WHAT THE ENGLISH REALLY WANTED WAS NOTHING LESS THAN SUCH A BINDING ALLIANCE OR RATHER COALITION AS WOULD PRACTICALLY MERGE THE LESSER STATE IN THE GREATER BUT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH A LOSS OF THE INDEPENDENCE THAT THEY HAD ONLY JUST WON WAS TO THE NETHERLANDERS UNTHINKABLE
THE NOMINATION OR THE CHOICE OUT OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF NOMINEES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE TOWN CORPORATIONS OF THE COURTS OF JUSTICE AND OF THE DELEGATES TO THE STATES GENERAL WAS GRANTED TO HIM THE DUTCH REPUBLIC WAS FULL OF ANOMALIES
AND BY THE OFFER OF FAVOURABLE TERMS THE STATES GENERAL WERE INDUCED TO ASK FOR A TRUCE OF SIX WEEKS
HAD NO ATTRACTION FOR THEM EVEN HAD THEY UNDERSTOOD THEIR PURPOSE AND MOTIVE
WHILE THOSE PARTS OF HOLLAND AND ZEELAND ON WHICH THE ENEMY HAD NOT SET FOOT HAD BEEN CRUSHED BENEATH HEAVY TAXES AND THE LOSS OF COMMERCE THE POSITION OF THE THREE PROVINCES UTRECHT GELDERLAND AND OVERYSSEL WHICH HAD BEEN OVERRUN BY THE FRENCH AT THE OPENING OF HOSTILITIES AND HELD BY THEM EVER SINCE
SPEEDILY FOLLOWED ON JUNE TENTH BY THE BIRTH OF A PRINCE OF WALES THE REPORT WAS SPREAD THAT THE CHILD WAS SUPPOSITITIOUS AND IT WAS ACCEPTED AS TRUE BY LARGE NUMBERS OF PERSONS INCLUDING THE PRINCESS ANNE AND ALSO ON THE STRENGTH OF HER TESTIMONY
LARGE TRACTS ON THE BORDERS OF HOLLAND UTRECHT AND FRIESLAND SUBMERGED BY THE SEA WATERS THROUGH THE CUTTING OF THE DAMS HAD BEEN RENDERED VALUELESS FOR SOME YEARS TO COME
BY THE IMPERIALIST CONTINGENTS HAD TO RETIRE FROM THE FIELD HE WAS NEVER A GREAT STRATEGIST BUT HE NOW CONDUCTED A RETREAT WHICH EXTRACTED ADMIRATION FROM HIS OPPONENTS
THE PRINCE WAS OPPOSED TO ANY HARSHNESS OF TREATMENT AND HIS WILL PREVAILED THE THREE PROVINCES WERE RE ADMITTED INTO THE UNION BUT WITH SHORN PRIVILEGES AND WILLIAM WAS ELECTED STADHOLDER BY EACH OF THEM WITH LARGELY INCREASED POWERS
BUT THE OLD SORES REMAINED OPEN MOREOVER THE REFUSAL OF THE STATES GENERAL TO RECEIVE THE PARLIAMENTARY ENVOYS THE MURDER OF DORESLAER AND THE PROTECTION AFFORDED TO ROYALIST REFUGEES HAD BEEN ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RESENTMENT
REALLY BELIEVED THAT PEACE WAS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THAT PEACE COULD ONLY BE MAINTAINED AT THE COST OF THE ACT OF EXCLUSION
ADRIAN PAUW HIMSELF LEFT HASTILY FOR LONDON JOHN DE WITT BEING APPOINTED TO ACT AS HIS DEPUTY DURING HIS ABSENCE PAUW'S STRENUOUS EFFORTS HOWEVER TO MAINTAIN PEACE WERE ALL IN VAIN DESPITE THE STRONG LEANINGS OF CROMWELL TOWARDS A PEACEFUL SOLUTION
FOREMOST AMONGST THEM PRINCE EDWARD SON OF THE QUEEN OF BOHEMIA THE PARLIAMENT THREATENED TO RECALL THE ENVOYS BUT CONSENTED THAT THEY SHOULD REMAIN ON THE UNDERTAKING OF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND TO PROTECT THEM FROM FURTHER ATTACKS AND TO PUNISH THE OFFENDERS
AND THERE WAS NEVER ANY BREACH IN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE NETHERLANDS THE MARRIAGE OF QUEEN WILHELMINA ON FEBRUARY SEVENTH NINETEEN O ONE WITH PRINCE HENRY OF MECKLENBURG SCHWERIN WAS WELCOMED BY THE PEOPLE
WITHOUT HEAVY EXPENDITURE AND THE MEANS WERE NOT FORTHCOMING TO MEET THE DEMAND A BILL WAS INTRODUCED IN AUGUST NINETEEN ELEVEN BY THE FINANCE MINISTER DOCTOR KOLKMAR
THAT THE ACT SHOULD BE PLACED IN HIS HANDS WITHIN TWO DAYS AFTER THE RATIFICATION OF THE TREATY WAS PEREMPTORY AND THREATENING UNLESS HE RECEIVED THE ACT HE WOULD CONSIDER THE TREATY AS NOT BINDING UPON HIM USING ALL HIS POWERS OF ADVOCACY
THE ELECTOR OF BRANDENBURG AS HEAD OF THE PRINCIPAL PROTESTANT STATE IN GERMANY HAD ALSO OFFERED AN ASYLUM TO THE FRENCH EXILES AND NOW REVERTED ONCE MORE TO HIS NATURAL ALLIANCE WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES HE SENT HIS TRUSTED COUNCILLOR
IN HAINAULT THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT OUT WITH GREAT OBSTINACY AND THERE WERE HEAVY LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES THE FRENCH HOWEVER THOUGH INFERIOR IN NUMBERS HAD THE ADVANTAGE IN BEING A MORE COMPACT FORCE THAN THAT OF THE ALLIES AND WILLIAM POORLY SUPPORTED
IN ANY CASE THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY BEING CONVINCED OF THE NECESSITY OF PEACE RESOLVED TO SECURE IT BY PLAYING A VERY DEEP AND DANGEROUS GAME NOT ONLY MUST THE WHOLE AFFAIR BE KEPT ABSOLUTELY FROM THE COGNISANCE OF THE STATES GENERAL
HAD LASTED FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS WHEN TROMP FOUND THAT HIS POWDER HAD RUN OUT AND THAT ON THE THIRD DAY MORE THAN HALF HIS FLEET WERE UNABLE TO CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE BUT INSPIRING HIS SUBORDINATES DE RUYTER EVERTSEN AND FLORISZOON WITH HIS OWN INDOMITABLE COURAGE
WHEREAS IN THE NETHERLANDS THERE WERE FIVE DISTINCT BOARDS OF ADMIRALTY TO SOME EXTENT JEALOUS OF EACH OTHER AND NOW LACKING THE SUPREME DIRECTION OF AN ADMIRAL GENERAL THE WAR BEGAN BY A SERIES OF ENGLISH SUCCESSES AND OF DUTCH MISFORTUNES
IF HUMILIATING TERMS WERE SUBMITTED TO STIFFENED THEIR ATTITUDE THE RESULT WAS THAT THE ENVOYS LEFT LONDON ON JUNE THIRTIETH SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO AND WAR WAS DECLARED THE DUTCH STATESMEN WHO SOUGHT TO AVOID HOSTILITIES WERE RIGHT
AND BY HIS MEDIATION AN UNDERSTANDING WAS ARRIVED AT BETWEEN THE STADHOLDER AND HIS OPPONENTS IN AMSTERDAM AT THE SAME TIME STRONG FAMILY INFLUENCE WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON HENRY CASIMIR OF FRIESLAND AND A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO STADHOLDERS WAS EFFECTED
IN UTRECHT GELDERLAND AND OVERYSSEL WE HAVE THE CURIOUS SPECTACLE IN THE DAYS OF WILLIAM THE THIRD OF THE STADHOLDER WHO WAS NOMINALLY A SERVANT OF THE SOVEREIGN ESTATES HIMSELF APPOINTING HIS MASTERS AS A MATTER OF FACT THE VOICE OF THESE PROVINCES WAS HIS VOICE AND
INCLINED TO FOLLOW HIS FATHER'S EXAMPLE AND CRUSH THE OPPOSITION OF AMSTERDAM BY FORCE
THE CLEVERNESS AND SKILL NOW SHOWN BY THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY WERE TRULY EXTRAORDINARY A SUMMONS WAS SENT OUT TO THE ESTATES TO MEET ON APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH WITHOUT ANY REASON BEING ASSIGNED THE MEMBERS ON ASSEMBLY WERE SWORN TO SECRECY
TROMP WAS PREVENTED FROM FOLLOWING BLAKE BY STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS HE THEN TURNED UPON AYSCUE WHOSE SMALL FORCE HE MUST HAVE OVERWHELMED BUT FOR A SUDDEN CHANGE TO A SOUTHERLY GALE THE DUTCH ADMIRAL NOW SAILED NORTHWARDS AND JULY TWENTY FIFTH
AND HIS TIRELESS OPPONENT THE PRINCE OF ORANGE HENCEFORTH MADE IT THE ONE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE TO FORM A GRAND ALLIANCE TO CURB FRENCH AMBITION AND UPHOLD IN EUROPE WHAT WAS HENCEFORTH KNOWN AS THE BALANCE OF POWER IN SETTING ABOUT THIS TASK WILLIAM WAS CONFRONTED WITH ALMOST INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTIES
AND THE RISK OF A RENEWAL OF THE WAR NO FURTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN AND THE PROTECTOR PROFESSED HIMSELF SATISFIED WITH A GUARANTEE OF SUCH DOUBTFUL VALIDITY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WITHHOLD ADMIRATION FROM DE WITT'S MARVELLOUS DIPLOMATIC DEXTERITY
UNA RESPUBLICA WHICH NOTHING BUT SHEER CONQUEST AND DIRE NECESSITY WOULD EVER INDUCE THE DUTCH PEOPLE TO ACCEPT ACCORDINGLY THE WAR WENT ON THOUGH THE ENVOYS DID NOT LEAVE LONDON HOPING STILL THAT SOME BETTER TERMS MIGHT BE OFFERED
BY HAVING TO PLACE GARRISONS IN THE CONQUERED PROVINCES AND NEITHER TURENNE NOR LUXEMBURG FELT STRONG ENOUGH TO ATTACK THE STRONGLY PROTECTED DUTCH FRONTIERS BEHIND THE WATER LINE THE PRINCE HOWEVER WAS NOT CONTENT WITH INACTION
AND TO HIM THE EYES OF A LARGE PARTY IN ENGLAND WERE TURNING
THE RESULTS HOWEVER DID NOT ANSWER WILLIAM'S EXPECTATIONS THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND THE STATES ALIKE HAD NO TRUST IN KING CHARLES NOR WAS THE ENGLISH MATCH AT FIRST POPULAR IN HOLLAND A STRONG OPPOSITION AROSE AGAINST THE PRINCE'S WAR POLICY
ON AUGUST TENTH JUST BEFORE TIME FOR RESUMING HOSTILITIES HAD BEEN REACHED THEY TACTFULLY CONCEDED THIS POINT AND PROMISED IMMEDIATE EVACUATION IF THE TREATY WERE AT ONCE CONCLUDED VAN BEVERNINGH AND HIS COLLEAGUES ACCORDINGLY ACTING ON THEIR INSTRUCTIONS
AND THE CONTRIBUTION THEIR LABOUR MAKES TOWARD RATIONAL LIFE IN THEIR BETTERS IS THE HIGHEST DIGNITY THEY CAN ATTAIN AND SHOULD BE PRIZED BY THEM AS A SUFFICIENT PRIVILEGE SUCH ASSERTIONS COMING FROM LORDLY LIPS
FOR NATURE'S PRIMEVAL CRUELTY WHILE THE BENEFITS IT MAY ALSO CONFER ARE ONLY FURTHER EXAMPLES OF HER NICE EQUILIBRIUM AND NECESSARY HARMONY FOR IT LIES IN THE ESSENCE OF A MECHANICAL WORLD WHERE THE INTERESTS OF ITS PRODUCTS
AND SENSUOUS AFFINITY COLOURING A SPIRITUAL LIGHT
FOR WHICH HIS MORE CONSTANT SOMATIC FEELINGS HIS RULING INTERESTS AND HIS SOCIAL RELATIONS FURNISH MOST OF THE SUBSTANCE
HERE THE PROCESS TAKEN IN THE GROSS DOES NOT EVEN BY MECHANICAL NECESSITY SUPPORT THE VALUE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO GUIDE IT THAT VALUE IS REALISED FOR A MOMENT ONLY
IT WOULD BE A HAPPY RELIEF TO THE ARISTOCRAT'S CONSCIENCE WHEN HE POSSESSES ONE COULD HE LEARN FROM SOME YET BOLDER DESCARTES THAT COMMON PEOPLE WERE NOTHING
CHAPTER ONE THE BIRTH OF REASON
REFUTE THIS PRESUMPTION BY URGING THAT EVERY COLLOCATION OF THINGS MUST HAVE BEEN PRECEDED BY ANOTHER COLLOCATION IN ITSELF NO LESS DEFINITE AND PRECISE AND FURTHER THAT SOME PRINCIPLE OF TRANSITION OR CONTINUITY
THEY MERGED THE POPULAR IDEA OF A PERSONAL GOD IN THEIR FORETASTE OF PEACE AND PERFECTION
THE FEUDAL SYSTEM OFFERS PERHAPS THE BEST ILLUSTRATION OF A PATRIOTISM WHOLLY SUBMERGED IN LOYALTY THE SENSE OF MUTUAL OBLIGATION AND SERVICE WAS VERY CLEAR IN THIS CASE THE VASSAL IN SWEARING FEALTY KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WHAT SORT OF A BARGAIN HE WAS STRIKING
SO TOO IN POLITICAL SOCIETY STATESMANSHIP IS MADE POSSIBLE BY TRADITIONAL POLICIES GENERALSHIP BY MILITARY INSTITUTIONS
THERE IS A STRANGE METAPHYSICAL ILLUSION IN IMAGINING THAT A MAN MIGHT CHANGE HIS PARENTS HIS BODY HIS EARLY ENVIRONMENT AND YET RETAIN HIS PERSONALITY
AFFECTION BASED ON THE REFRACTION NO NATURAL VEHICLE HOWEVER IS INDIFFERENT NO NATURAL ORGAN IS OR SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT TRANSPARENCY
IN POSTHUMOUS FAME THE DIRECT OBJECT OF THIS PASSION THAT A NAME SHOULD SURVIVE IN MEN'S MOUTHS TO WHICH NO ADEQUATE IDEA OF ITS ORIGINAL CAN BE ATTACHED SEEMS A THIN AND FANTASTIC SATISFACTION ESPECIALLY
IN THE FIRST INSTANCE CONCERN FOR HIS OWN PRACTICAL WELFARE BUT IMAGINATION HERE REFINES UPON WORLDLY INTEREST WHAT OTHERS THINK OF US WOULD BE OF LITTLE MOMENT DID IT NOT WHEN KNOWN
BUT IN THE STATE EVERY CELL HAS A SEPARATE BRAIN AND THE GREATEST CITIZEN BY HIS EXISTENCE REALISES ONLY HIS OWN
ARE CONCERNED TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY KIND SINCE IT HAS FORMED AND ON THE WHOLE MAINTAINS THOSE PRODUCTS AND YET CONTINUALLY CRUEL SINCE IT FORMS AND MAINTAINS THEM BLINDLY WITHOUT CONSIDERING DIFFICULTIES OR PROBABLE FAILURES
NOR IS IT HERE NECESSARY TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT TO CALL RESULTS THEIR OWN CAUSES IS ALWAYS PREPOSTEROUS FOR IN THIS CASE EVEN THE MYTHICAL SENSE WHICH MIGHT BE ATTACHED TO SUCH LANGUAGE IS INAPPLICABLE
A GREATER NET PRODUCT IS SECURED TO LABOUR EVEN AFTER ALL NEEDFUL TAXES HAVE BEEN LEVIED UPON IT TO SUPPORT GREATNESS AN INDUSTRIAL AND POLITICAL OLIGARCHY MIGHT DEFEND ITSELF ON THAT GROUND OR THE RETURN MIGHT TAKE THE LESS POSITIVE FORM OF OPPORTUNITY
NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SOLVED AS BECAUSE ONE PARTY HAD BEEN SILENCED BY SOCIAL PRESSURE
LIE NOT WITHIN HIS UNIVERSE OF ASPIRATION EVEN HIS MOST PERVERSELY METAPHYSICAL ENVY CAN BEGRUDGE TO OTHERS
THERE IS SOCIETY WHERE NONE INTRUDES AND FOR MOST MEN SYMPATHY WITH THEIR IMAGINARY SELVES IS A POWERFUL AND DOMINANT EMOTION TRUE MEMORY OFFERS BUT A MEAGRE AND INTERRUPTED VISTA
ONE THAT UNDOUBTEDLY HOLDS IN EARTHLY ECONOMY A NOT DISSIMILAR OBSERVATION IS MADE IN THE PROVERB POSSESSION IS NINE TENTHS OF THE LAW INDEED SOME TRIFLING ACQUISITION OFTEN GIVES AN ANIMAL
IT HAS NO COGENCY FOR THE INATTENTIVE AND NO EXISTENCE FOR THE IGNORANT ALTHOUGH THE UNIVERSE THEN MAY NOT HAVE COME FROM CHAOS HUMAN EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY HAS BEGUN IN A PRIVATE AND DREAMFUL CHAOS OF ITS OWN
ACCORDINGLY THE SYMBOL WHEN HIGHLY PRIZED AND LONG CONTEMPLATED MAY EASILY BECOME AN IDOL THAT IN IT WHICH IS NOT IDEAL NOR REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WORSHIPPER'S DEMAND
IT CELEBRATES AN ATTAINED BALANCE IN NATURE OR GRIEVES AT ITS COLLAPSE
NOT ONLY DOES ARISTOCRACY LAY ON THE WORLD A TAX IN LABOUR AND PRIVATION THAT ITS OWN SPLENDOURS INTELLECTUAL AND WORLDLY MAY ARISE
SINCE A NORMAL MARRIED LIFE CAN PRODUCE THE SYMPATHIES IT REQUIRES
IT IS NO LOSS OF LIBERTY TO SUBORDINATE OURSELVES TO A NATURAL LEADER ON THE CONTRARY WE THEREBY SEIZE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXERCISE OUR FREEDOM AVAILING OURSELVES OF THE BEST INSTRUMENT OBTAINABLE TO ACCOMPLISH OUR ENDS
YET IF A KING WERE NOTHING BUT A MAN SURROUNDED BY FLATTERERS WHO WAS CHEERED WHEN HE DROVE ABROAD THERE WOULD BE LITTLE STABILITY IN MONARCHY A KING IS REALLY THE STATE'S HINGE AND CENTRE OF GRAVITY THE POINT WHERE ALL PRIVATE AND PARTY AMBITIONS MEET AND IN A SENSE ARE NEUTRALISED
NOR ONE IT IS NOW ABLE IN SOME ORACULAR FASHION TO FORMULATE AND TO IMPOSE UPON US THE REPORT IS A RATIONAL CONSTRUCTION BASED AND SEATED IN PRESENT EXPERIENCE
A DIFFERENCE WHICH RENDERS AGRIPPA'S FABLE WHOLLY MISLEADING THE HANDS AND FEET HAVE NO SEPARATE CONSCIOUSNESS AND IF THEY ARE ILL USED IT IS THE COMMON SELF THAT FEELS THE WEARINESS AND THE BRUISES
SUFFERING IS IT IS NOT MERE INEQUALITY THEREFORE THAT CAN BE A REPROACH TO THE ARISTOCRATIC OR THEISTIC IDEAL COULD EACH PERSON FULFIL HIS OWN NATURE
HIS COMMAND MIGHT BY CONVENTION BE REGARDED AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE COMMON VOICE JUST AS THE FATHER'S WILL IS BY NATURE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF HIS CHILDREN'S INTERESTS
AND WHAT REMAINED WERE AT BEST A COMPROMISE ACCORDINGLY WE NEED NOT BE SURPRISED IF ASPIRATION IN ALL THESE MEN FINALLY TAKES A MYSTICAL TURN AND DANTE'S GHOSTLY FRIENDS AFTER PROPOUNDING THEIR ARISTOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY TO JUSTIFY GOD IN OTHER MEN'S EYES
SOME LITTLE PROPENSITIES BETRAYED IN CHILDHOOD MAY VERY PROBABLY SURVIVE ONE MAN MAY PROVE BY HIS DYING WORDS THAT HE WAS CONGENITALLY WITTY ANOTHER TENDER ANOTHER BRAVE
THE MORE FRUITFUL PROCEDURE IS ACCORDINGLY TO IDEALISE SOME HISTORICAL FIGURE OR NATURAL FORCE TO IGNORE OR MINIMISE IN IT WHAT DOES NOT SEEM ACCEPTABLE AND TO RETAIN AT THE SAME TIME ALL THE
THINKING THEY COULD MORE ECONOMICALLY SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES MAY STARVE THE BRAIN AND REDUCE THE BODY POLITIC TO A COLONY OF VEGETATING MICROBES IN A WORD THE CONSCIOUSNESS INHABITING THE BRAIN
ABSOLUTE ORDER OR TRUTH IS STATIC IMPOTENT INDIFFERENT OF COURSE THE VARIOUS STATES OF THE WORLD WHEN WE SURVEY THEM RETROSPECTIVELY CONSTITUTE ANOTHER AND NOW STATIC ORDER CALLED HISTORIC TRUTH
WE MAY ENJOY COMMUNION WITH HIS MIND AND FEEL HIS SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE IN FOLLOWING THE IDEAL WHICH LINKS US TOGETHER HERO WORSHIP IS AN IMAGINATIVE PASSION IN WHICH
INCREASE THEIR NUMBER SINCE EVERY ADVANCE OPENS UP NEW VISTAS AND GROWTH IN EXTENDING THE PERIPHERY OF THE SUBSTANCE ORGANISED MULTIPLIES THE NUMBER OF POINTS AT WHICH NEW GROWTHS MAY BEGIN
ADDS WRONG TO NATURE'S INJURY
EACH OFFICE WOULD REMAIN FILLED AND NO TRACE OF A CHANGE WOULD BE PERCEPTIBLE BUT THE PENNY THAT ONE MAN FINDS AND ANOTHER MISSES WOULD NOT HAD FORTUNE BEEN REVERSED HAVE TRANSMUTED EACH MAN INTO THE OTHER
IN COMPARISON WITH THE SOCIAL INERTIA THAT PERPETUATES ALL THE CLASSES AND EVEN SUCH SHIFTS AS OCCUR AT ONCE RE ESTABLISH ARTIFICIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION AS A RULE
I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN HOW YOU RESCUED ME FROM THE EAGLE
THE OFFER WAS ACCEPTED BUT WHEN MORNING CAME AS THE DAY BROKE IN THE EAST THE TWO CHILDREN LET HIM OUT AND OVER THE SNOW HE WENT BACK INTO THE WOOD
SNOW WHITE THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING SHINING LIKE GOLD THROUGH THE RENT BUT HE WENT OUT SO QUICKLY THAT SHE COULD NOT FEEL CERTAIN WHAT IT WAS AND SOON HE WAS HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES
AND THE BRIGHT SUNRISE AWOKE THEM THEY SAW A BEAUTIFUL CHILD IN A SNOW WHITE ROBE SHINING LIKE DIAMONDS SITTING CLOSE TO THE SPOT WHERE THEY HAD REPOSED SHE AROSE WHEN THEY OPENED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED KINDLY AT THEM
TELL ME GLASS TELL ME TRUE OF ALL THE LADIES IN THE LAND WHO IS FAIREST TELL ME WHO AND THE GLASS ANSWERED THOU QUEEN ART FAIREST IN THE LAND
PULLING HIS THICK FUR OR PLACING THEIR FEET ON HIS BACK OR ROLLING HIM OVER AND OVER THEN THEY TOOK A SLENDER HAZEL TWIG USING IT UPON HIS THICK COAT AND THEY LAUGHED WHEN HE GROWLED THE BEAR PERMITTED THEM TO AMUSE THEMSELVES IN THIS WAY
AND NEARLY DEAD WITH TERROR HIS WIFE DESCENDED STILL ENTREATING HIM TO SPARE HER LIFE HE WOULD NOT HOWEVER GIVE HEED TO HER PRAYERS AND WAS JUST BRANDISHING HIS SWORD SO THAT IT MIGHT COME DOWN STRAIGHT AND TRUE UPON HER SLENDER NECK WHEN THE DOOR BURST OPEN
TO THIS THE PRINCESS REPLIED MOST GRACIOUSLY SAYING THAT HIS PETITION MOVED HER MORE THAN ANY OTHER COULD DO BUT KNOW SHE ADDED AS I WAS WALKING BY THE RIVER A MONTH AGO AS I TOOK OFF MY GLOVE A RING THAT I GREATLY VALUE FELL INTO THE WATER
THAT I WILL NOT LEAVE MY KINGDOM WITHOUT TAKING IT WITH ME
THEN ALL RODE FURTHER ON THEIR JOURNEY TILL THE DAY GREW SO WARM AND THE SUN SO SCORCHING THAT THE BRIDE BEGAN TO FEEL VERY THIRSTY AGAIN
SO THE KING USING THIS WATER ONE EVENING THINKING IT TO BE THE BEAUTY WATER AND HOPING AND EXPECTING TO BE MADE MORE HANDSOME WENT TO SLEEP AND AWOKE NO MORE
SO THE FISH HAD THE ADVANTAGE AND WAS DRAGGING THE DWARF AFTER IT
I WISHED TO SEE IF YOU WERE AS GOOD AS EVERYBODY DECLARES YOU ARE AND FOR THIS REASON I CHANGED MYSELF INTO THE LITTLE RABBIT
SHE FORGOT HER MAID'S RUDE SPEECH AND SAID PRAY GET DOWN AND FETCH ME SOME WATER TO DRINK IN MY GOLDEN CUP BUT THE MAID ANSWERED HER AND EVEN SPOKE MORE HAUGHTILY THAN BEFORE DRINK IF YOU WILL BUT I SHALL NOT BE YOUR WAITING MAID
WITH THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WORKED INTO ITS PATTERN TOYS OF ALL DESCRIPTIONS THAT A CHILD WOULD LOVE TO PLAY WITH AND A CRADLE ORNAMENTED WITH RUBIES AND DIAMONDS AND SUPPORTED BY FOUR CUPIDS READY TO ROCK IT SHOULD THE BABY CRY BUT
SO GREAT IS MY LOVE FOR THE PRINCESS DESIREE BUT WHERE HAVE YOU SEEN HER ENQUIRED THE KING THE PRINCE HASTENED TO FETCH HER PORTRAIT AND THE KING WAS SO GREATLY STRUCK BY DESIREE'S BEAUTY THAT HE AGREED TO FOLLOW HIS SON'S WISHES
BUT ONE DAY WHEN HE RETURNED FROM THE CHASE HAVING CAUGHT NOTHING HE FELT SO ILL HUMOURED THAT WHEN HIS DOG BIBI CAME FAWNING UPON HIM HE KICKED THE POOR FAITHFUL CREATURE FROM HIM
THE SHOE IS TOO SMALL AND NOT MADE FOR YOU PRINCE PRINCE LOOK AGAIN FOR THY BRIDE FOR SHE'S NOT THE TRUE ONE THAT SITS BY THY SIDE
AND ALL WERE MAKING READY TO GO TO BED THE WIDOW TOLD THE BEAR YOU MAY STAY HERE AND LIE BY THE HEARTH IF YOU LIKE
AND ONE DAY WHEN THIS KEEPER LAY ASLEEP AND A TIGER WHO HAD BROKEN LOOSE WAS ABOUT TO DEVOUR HIM
WHEN SPRINGTIME CAME AND ALL AROUND BEGAN TO LOOK GREEN AND BRIGHT ONE MORNING THE BEAR SAID TO SNOW WHITE NOW I MUST LEAVE YOU AND ALL THE SUMMER LONG I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO COME BACK WHERE THEN ARE YOU GOING DEAR BEAR ASKED SNOW WHITE
AND ON HEARING HER ADVENTURE THE MAID OF HONOUR TOLD HER SHE MUST NEVER AGAIN VENTURE OUT BUT THE PRINCESS REPLIED IT IS NO USE TALKING THUS WHEN I AM A FAWN THIS ROOM IS STIFLING TO ME AND I MUST DEPART FROM IT
AND AT LAST SHE BEGGED HER MOTHER VERY HARD TO LET HER GO YOU CINDERELLA SAID SHE
BUT NOT THE LITTLE ONE THAT SHE LEFT BEHIND BLUEBEARD NOTICED THIS DIRECTLY AND SENT HER TO FETCH IT TREMBLING AND WHITE AS A SHEET SHE WAS FORCED TO GIVE IT INTO HIS HAND HA WHAT IS THIS HE CRIED
THE FAIRY ALSO TOLD THEM WHERE THEY COULD FIND A LITTLE HUT IN WHICH TO PASS THE NIGHTS THEN SHE DISAPPEARED
SNOW WHITE WAS MORE GENTLE AND QUIETER THAN HER SISTER WHO LIKED BETTER SKIPPING ABOUT THE FIELDS SEEKING FLOWERS AND CATCHING SUMMER BIRDS WHILE SNOW WHITE STAYED AT HOME WITH HER MOTHER
JUST SEE THOSE PRECIOUS STONES LYING THERE GRANT ME MY LIFE WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH SUCH AN INSIGNIFICANT LITTLE FELLOW YOU WOULD NOT NOTICE ME BETWEEN YOUR TEETH SEE THOUGH THOSE TWO CHILDREN
WHAT ARE YOU GAZING AT CRIED THE DWARF AT THE SAME TIME BECOMING RED WITH RAGE AND WHAT ARE YOU STANDING THERE FOR MAKING UGLY FACES IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE PROCEEDED IN THE SAME COMPLIMENTARY MANNER
BANDAGING UP ONE ARM FROM WHICH THE BLOOD WAS FLOWING THEY BOTH SEEMED GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WOUND
FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP INSTEAD OF ADVANCING HAS GONE BACKWARDS THEN IN SPITE OF ALL THE QUEEN AND THE FAIRIES COULD SAY THE CRAB WENT BACKWARDS OUT OF THE DOOR LEAVING THEM IN THE SADDEST CONSTERNATION
BUT THEY SAID WE WILL NOT PART WITH HER FOR ALL THE GOLD IN THE WORLD
AND THESE WORDS WERE REPEATED TO THE KING IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY MADE HIM VERY ANGRY AND HE ORDERED AVENANT TO BE SHUT UP IN A HIGH TOWER TO DIE OF HUNGER IN THIS SAD PLIGHT AVENANT EXCLAIMED ONE DAY HOW HAVE I OFFENDED HIS MAJESTY
THEN BLUEBEARD BID HIS WIFE GOOD BYE AND DEPARTED AS SOON AS MISSUS BLUEBEARD'S FRIENDS AND RELATIONS KNEW THAT HER HUSBAND WAS AWAY THEY CAME FLOCKING TO VISIT HER FOR THEY LONGED TO SEE ALL HER SPLENDID POSSESSIONS BUT HAD FEARED TO COME BEFORE
CAN'T YOU COME AND TRY TO HELP ME WHAT WERE YOU DOING LITTLE FELLOW ENQUIRED ROSE RED STUPID INQUISITIVE GOOSE
BUT THAT DID NOT ASSIST HIM GREATLY HE WAS FORCED TO FOLLOW ALL THE TWISTINGS OF THE FISH AND WAS PERPETUALLY IN DANGER OF BEING DRAWN INTO THE BROOK THE GIRLS ARRIVED JUST IN TIME THEY CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM FIRMLY AND ENDEAVOURED TO UNTWIST HIS BEARD FROM THE LINE
WHILE SHE WAS STRAINING AT THE RIBBONS TRYING TO BREAK THEM
PACKED UP A GREAT MANY COSTLY THINGS JEWELS AND GOLD AND SILVER TRINKETS FINE DRESSES AND IN SHORT EVERYTHING THAT BECAME A ROYAL BRIDE FOR SHE LOVED HER CHILD VERY DEARLY
THE FIFTH WHO HAS BEEN HANDLING MY FORK THE SIXTH WHO HAS BEEN CUTTING WITH MY KNIFE THE SEVENTH WHO HAS BEEN DRINKING MY WINE
THROUGH WHICH EVERYTHING NECESSARY COULD BE CARRIED AND IN THIS TOWER THE LITTLE PRINCESS WAS SHUT UP AND THERE SHE LIVED BY CANDLELIGHT WHERE NEVER A GLIMPSE OF THE SUN COULD COME
A HANDSOME YOUNG KING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS PRINCESS FELL SO DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH HER FROM WHAT HE HAD HEARD
I PROMISED YOUR FATHER SAID SHE IN A STERN VOICE TO GIVE YOU GOOD ADVICE AND TO PUNISH YOU IF YOU REFUSED TO FOLLOW IT YOU HAVE DESPISED MY COUNSELS AND YOUR CRIMES HAVE CONVERTED YOU INTO A MONSTER THE HORROR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH
THIS PRINCESS NOIRE NOW WENT TO THE FAIRY OF THE FOUNTAIN WHO WAS HER BEST FRIEND
SNOW WHITE SET LIGHT TO THE FIRE AND PUT ON THE KETTLE AFTER POLISHING IT UNTIL IT WAS LIKE GOLD FOR BRIGHTNESS IN THE EVENING WHEN SNOW WAS FALLING HER MOTHER WOULD BID HER BOLT THE DOOR AND THEN SITTING BY THE HEARTH
THE BEAR BEGAN SPEAKING AND SAID DO NOT BE AFRAID I WILL NOT DO YOU ANY HARM I AM HALF FROZEN AND WOULD LIKE TO WARM MYSELF A LITTLE AT YOUR FIRE POOR BEAR THE MOTHER REPLIED COME IN AND LIE BY THE FIRE
AND SHE WAS CALLED SNOW WHITE
HER MAIDS OF HONOUR GIROFLEE LOVED HER PASSIONATELY AND FAITHFULLY BUT LONGUE EPINE WAS FULL OF ENVY OF THE PRINCESS WHO WAS SO GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL AND BESIDES LONGUE EPINE
POOR WIDOW ONCE LIVED IN A LITTLE COTTAGE IN FRONT OF THE COTTAGE WAS A GARDEN IN WHICH WERE GROWING TWO ROSE TREES ONE OF THESE BORE WHITE ROSES AND THE OTHER RED
THEN THEY TOOK AWAY HER FINE CLOTHES AND GAVE HER AN OLD FROCK TO PUT ON AND LAUGHED AT HER AND TURNED HER INTO THE KITCHEN
AFTER THAT HE STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND PLEASED HIMSELF BY GROWLING A LITTLE ONLY TO SHOW THAT HE WAS HAPPY AND COMFORTABLE BEFORE LONG THEY WERE ALL QUITE GOOD FRIENDS AND THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO PLAY WITH THEIR UNLOOKED FOR VISITOR
THANKING HER A THOUSAND TIMES AVENANT GOING AT ONCE TO THE PALACE SAID PRINCESS YOUR COMMAND IS FULFILLED MAY IT PLEASE YOU TO RECEIVE THE KING MY MASTER AS YOUR HUSBAND THE PRINCESS THOUGHT SHE MUST BE DREAMING WHEN SHE SAW THE RING BUT SHE SET AVENANT ANOTHER TASK
HE HAD A LION'S HEAD A BULL'S HORNS THE FEET OF A WOLF AND THE TAIL OF A VIPER AT THE SAME MOMENT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A FOREST AND THERE AFTER ROAMING ABOUT MISERABLY FOR SOME TIME HE FELL INTO A PIT DUG BY HUNTERS
AND KNIVES AND FORKS LAID IN ORDER AND BY THE WALL STOOD SEVEN LITTLE BEDS THEN AS SHE WAS VERY HUNGRY SHE PICKED A LITTLE PIECE OFF EACH LOAF AND DRANK A VERY LITTLE WINE OUT OF EACH GLASS AND AFTER THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD LIE DOWN AND REST
SHE HAD TWO CHILDREN WHO RESEMBLED THE ROSE TREES ONE WAS CALLED SNOW WHITE AND THE OTHER ROSE RED AND THEY WERE AS RELIGIOUS AND LOVING BUSY AND UNTIRING AS ANY TWO CHILDREN EVER WERE

UP BEFORE FIVE IN HER BARE LITTLE ROOM IN THE WEST GABLE BUSY WITH MORNING CHORES UNTIL BREAKFAST WAS READY SHE HAD EARNED A REST LONG BEFORE THE LITTLE COLONEL'S DAY HAD BEGUN AFTERWARD SHE HAD HELPED WITH THE BREAKFAST DISHES
NOT CERTAIN TO WHOM IT BELONGED ALTHOUGH SHE MIGHT HAVE GUESSED CONSIDERING HOW BROWN AND HARDENED BY WORK IT WAS TOO SENSITIVE AND TOO IMAGINATIVE BY FAR SHE SAID BUT I LIKE THIS LITTLE HAND
AND COLONEL LLOYD WAS PROUD OF IT HE WAS PROUD OF THE FACT THAT SHE HAD INHERITED HIS LORDLY MANNER HIS HOT TEMPER AND IMPERIOUS WAYS IT PLEASED HIM THAT PEOPLE HAD GIVEN HER HIS TITLE OF COLONEL
IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT TO ASK ANY ONE ELSE TO GO WITH HER AND MISS THE CHANCE OF WINNING THE PRIZE TOO
AND SET TO WORK TO CUT HIS OWN UNDERNEATH EUGENIA SEATED HERSELF ON A ROCK NEAR BY TO WATCH HIM
A WIDE PIKE WITH A RAILROAD TRACK ON ONE SIDE OF IT AND A BRIDLE PATH ON THE OTHER TWO MINUTES BRISK CANTER BROUGHT HER TO ANOTHER GATE ONE THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED ALL WINTER AND ONE THAT SHE WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE DARK BY THE TIME SHE REACHED THE CROSS ROADS AGAIN IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THAT THE MOON WAS BEGINNING TO RISE AND CAST A FAINT WHITENESS OVER THE DUSKY FIELDS SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER WHICH WAY TO TURN
JOYCE SAID ROB PROMPTLY I THINK SO TOO
SHE WALKED SLOWLY ALONG THROUGH THE SHADY ORCHARD SWINGING HER SUNBONNET BY THE STRINGS AFTER THE ORCHARD CAME THE LONG LEAFY LANE WITH ITS DOUBLE ROWS OF CHERRY TREES AND THEN THE GATE AT THE END
ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS A RUSTLING OF THE HIGH CORN AND OUT OF IT LIMPED A BIG BURLY NEGRO HE HAD A GUN ON HIS SHOULDER AND A SAVAGE EYED DOG SKULKED AT HIS HEELS BETTY NEARLY SCREAMED IN HER TERROR AT THIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE
ANSWERED LLOYD LAUGHING AT THE RECOLLECTION
EUGENIA SWITCHED HER SKIRTS DISDAINFULLY THROUGH THE HALL AND MOUNTED IN DIGNIFIED DISGUST YOU'RE ELEGANT I MUST SAY SHE EXCLAIMED SCORNFULLY I WOULDN'T PLAY SUCH A KID GAME NEVERTHELESS SHE DASHED DOWN THE AVENUE AT THE TOP OF HER SPEED
BUT I MUST YOU MUST GET TO THE POST OFFICE IN TIME URGED ALONG BY THE SWITCH AND HER TEARFUL PLEADINGS LAD BROKE INTO A RUN AND BROUGHT UP AT THE POST OFFICE JUST AS THE POSTMISTRESS WAS LOCKING THE MAIL BAG
THEN WHAT DID YOU DO ASKED ROB WITH A GRIN HE HAD EXPERIMENTED WITH LLOYD'S TEMPER HIMSELF IN THE PAST
SUDDENLY ILL AND HAD SLIPPED AWAY QUIETLY IN ORDER NOT TO DISTURB THE PLEASURE OF THE OTHERS KEITH HAD OFFERED TO RIDE UP TO LOCUST AND SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HIS SURPRISE SHOWED ITSELF IN HIS RAPID QUESTIONING WHEN HE MET HER RIDING WILDLY AWAY
ALL THESE THOUGHTS WENT ON SWAYING HER FIRST TO ONE DECISION AND THEN ANOTHER SHE HALF ROSE FROM THE RUG WHERE SHE WAS SITTING THEN DROPPED DOWN AGAIN IT SEEMED HARDLY FAIR THAT EUGENIA SHOULD NOT SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE NAME YOU WOULD CARVE THAT WAY AND PUT AN ARROW THROUGH IT SHE SAID MEANINGLY AT ANY RATE A SILVER ARROW OH MAYBE YOU THINK I HAVEN'T SEEN HER WEAR IT AND BLUSH WHEN I TEASED HER ABOUT IT MALCOLM WENT ON CUTTING WITHOUT AN ANSWER
FROM THE DISMAL PLACE THEY HAD LEFT IN THEIR FLIGHT FROM NAPLES IT WAS NOW TEEMING WITH LIFE FOR ALL DANGER BEING PAST THE TOURISTS HAD FLOCKED TO THE CITY IN DROVES
THAT'S IT SAID UNCLE JOHN YOU'VE MADE ME A QUARTER OF A MILLION THAT I DON'T WANT THE C H AND D STOCKS WERE GOING TO PIECES WHEN I BOUGHT THEM AND I HAD REASON TO HOPE I'D LOSE A GOOD ROUND SUM ON THEM BUT THE CONFOUNDED LUCK TURNED
AS THEY ENTERED THE PRETTY CIRCULAR HALL DEVOTED TO THE DANCE LOUISE GAVE A START OF SURPRISE
AND BETH MOUNTED THE BOX AND RODE BESIDE HER FRIEND THE DRIVER
COUNT FERRALTI THE YOUNG MAN STANDING BY THE WINDOW YONDER I I DID NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY THE GENTLEMAN ARRIVED LAST EVENING AND I HAD NOT YET LEARNED HIS NAME LET ME SEE
BOWED RESPECTFULLY TO THE WHISKERED MAN SHOT A BROADSIDE OF INVECTIVE ITALIAN AT THE UNCONSCIOUS AMERICANS AND LEFT THE HOTEL HOW ABOUT ROOMS ASKED UNCLE JOHN
IT WOULD BE MANY MORE DAYS BEFORE THE INTERIOR OF THE MASS BECAME COLD THROUGH THE FORLORN DUST COVERED VINEYARDS THEY DROVE TO SAN GUISEPPE WHERE A CHURCH ROOF HAD FALLEN IN
AND THEN CAME A LETTER FROM COLONEL ANGELI TELLING THEM TO RETURN TO NAPLES AND WITNESS THE RESULTS OF THE ERUPTION
WHO HAD ONCE LIVED IN AMERICA FOR THEIR LUNCHEON AN HOUR LATER AND JUST AS THEY WERE SITTING DOWN TO THE MEAL COUNT FERRALTI REJOINED THEM
NAPLES ISN'T BURIED MORE THAN SIX INCHES IN ASHES AS YET AND IT WILL TAKE
PERHAPS SHE'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE SENSIBLE SUGGESTED THE MAJOR WELL I'LL SEE HER AND HER MOTHER TO MORROW MORNING DECIDED UNCLE JOHN
THE COUNT CLUNG TO LOUISE'S SIDE BUT ALSO TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO HER COUSINS
HO TELEPHONE VE SUVE VE
AND YOU WON'T BE AWAY MUCH LONGER THAN YOU WERE WHEN YOU WENT TO ELMHURST AFTER AUNT JANE'S MONEY WHICH YOU DIDN'T GET MARY TAKES FINE CARE OF OUR LITTLE ROOMS AND DOUBTLESS I SHALL BE SO BUSY THAT I WON'T MISS YOU AT ALL AT ALL DADDY
OR HIS OATMEAL FOR BREAKFAST AND PATSY HAS THE HOUSE TO LOOK AFTER ADDED THE MAJOR COMPLACENTLY UNCLE JOHN GAVE A SNORT OF CONTEMPT FOR AN UNREASONABLE MAN SHOW ME AN IRISHMAN HE REMARKED
AND PREFERRED NOT TO SEND FOR THE CONSUL HE OFFERED TO RELEASE UNCLE JOHN IF HE WOULD GIVE THE CABMAN A GOOD LIRA IN EXCHANGE FOR THE BAD ONE THE OFFICIAL FEE WOULD BE FIVE LIRA
AND NO SUCH NOBLE FAMILY SIGNOR MERRICK UNCLE JOHN WHISTLED SOFTLY AND WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW THE YOUNG MAN GREETED HIM WITH A SMILE AND A BOW I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR NAME LAST EVENING HE SAID I THOUGHT YOU WERE COUNT FERRALTI
I HAVE ADVICE DO NOT GO ON SHORE IT IS USELESS THEY WERE ALL STARTLED BY THIS STRANGE SPEECH
THREE BETTER GIRLS NEVER LIVED AND I'LL TRUST EM ANYWHERE BESIDES THAT WE AREN'T GOING TO ANY OF YOUR CONFOUNDED SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WE'RE GOING ON A REG'LAR PICNIC AND IF I DON'T GIVE THOSE GIRLS THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES MY NAME AIN'T JOHN MERRICK
YOU STAY IN THIS ROOM AND DON'T MOVE A PEG TILL I GET BACK HE ENJOINED THEM
GOOD MORNING SAID UNCLE JOHN FINE DAY ISN'T IT DID YOU HEAR IT WHISPERED THE CONCIERGE AS A DULL BOOM LIKE THAT OF A DISTANT CANNON MADE THE WINDOWS RATTLE IN THEIR CASEMENTS
SO OPPORTUNELY WAS NONE OTHER THAN COUNT FERRALTI
IF THESE NEAPOLITANS COULD SEE THE REJOICING IN MY HEART THEY WOULD KILL ME AND YOU PAH YOU ARE NO BETTER YOU ALSO REJOICE AND THEY WILL WELCOME YOU TO NAPLES
HE EXCLAIMED LET'S HOLD A COUNCIL OF WAR DO YOU SUPPOSE WE ARE IN ANY REAL DANGER THEY GROUPED AROUND HIM WITH EAGER INTEREST
HE TURNED TO HIS LIST OF GUESTS WHO REGISTER BY CARD AND NOT IN A BOOK AND CONTINUED
OF WHICH THEY IMMEDIATELY TOOK POSSESSION SEND FOR OUR TRUNKS SAID MISTER MERRICK AND THE MAN CONSENTED TO DO SO PROVIDED HE COULD SECURE A PROPER VEHICLE YOU WILL BE OBLIGED TO PAY HIGH FOR IT HE WARNED
HIS AFFECTION FOR THE LITTLE MAN INCREASED MIGHTILY BUT HIS RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE PROMPTLY CHANGED AND A CHANCE TO REPROVE OR DISCOMFIT HIS ABSURDLY RICH BROTHER IN LAW WAS ONE OF HIS MOST SATISFACTORY DIVERSIONS UNCLE JOHN APPRECIATED THIS
LET US SEE IT INSTANTLY THE CROWD SCAMPERED BACK TO THE SQUARE FOLLOWED MORE LEISURELY BY UNCLE JOHN AND THE GIRLS THERE THE UNIFORMED VETTURIO STOOD BESIDE THE ONE MODERN CARRIAGE IN THE GROUP IT WAS NEW IT WAS GLOSSY
SAID UNCLE JOHN GRAVELY AND I'VE NO RIGHT TO TAKE FOOLISH CHANCES WITH THREE GIRLS ON MY HANDS I'M NOT FRIGHTENED UNCLE JOHN NOR I
LOUISE IS STILL SWEETLY SLEEPING SHE SAID AND WON'T WAKEN FOR HOURS YET IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH HER HE ASKED ANXIOUSLY OH DEAR NO BUT EVERYONE DOES NOT GET UP WITH THE MILKMAN AS YOU DO JOHN
THE CABMAN WAS DISPATCHED FOR SOMEONE WHO COULD SPEAK ENGLISH AND WHEN AN INTERPRETER ARRIVED THE AMERICAN TOLD HIM TO SEND FOR THE UNITED STATES CONSUL
AND SAT BOLT UPRIGHT GAZING AT HIS COMPANIONS WITH A STARTLED LOOK THAT MELTED INTO ONE OF BENIGN COMPLACENCY AS HE OBSERVED HIS SURROUNDINGS AND REALIZED WHERE HE WAS THE INTERRUPTION GAVE PATSY AN OPPORTUNITY TO STOP PLAYING THE TUNE
BUT IT DID NOT STRIKE JOHN MERRICK AS IN ANY WAY EXTRAORDINARY HE THOUGHT HE COULD DEPEND UPON BETH SHE WOULD BE AS EAGER TO GO AS HE WAS TO HAVE HER AND WHEN HE HAD PAID FOR THE TELEGRAM HE DISMISSED THE MATTER FROM FURTHER THOUGHT NEXT MORNING
YET IN HIS MATURE EYES THERE WAS NOT MUCH ABOUT FERRALTI TO AROUSE ADMIRATION AND THE LITTLE MAN CONSIDERED HIS GIRLS TOO SENSIBLE TO BE GREATLY IMPRESSED
WHO WAS BUT SEVENTEEN HAD MANY GOOD AND WOMANLY QUALITIES COULD THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN AN ATMOSPHERE UNINFLUENCED BY THE SCHEMES OF HER VAIN AND SELFISH MOTHER UNCLE JOHN CASTING ASIDE THE MASK OF POVERTY CAME TO THE RELIEF OF ALL THREE GIRLS
NOT YET HE SAID I'D FORGOTTEN TO MENTION IT TO THEM FOR MY PART CONTINUED THE GIRL I CAN GET READY IN A WEEK EASILY BUT BETH IS WAY OUT IN OHIO AND WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE CAN GO OR NOT I'LL TELEGRAPH HER AND FIND OUT SAID UNCLE JOHN
THE ELEVATOR CONDUCTORS ARE GONE IF YOU STAY YOU'LL HAVE TO WALK UP WHERE HAVE THEY ALL GONE ASKED UNCLE JOHN WONDERINGLY
PERSONALLY ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE TOWNS THAT HAD SUFFERED THE MOST FROM THE ERUPTION AT BOSCATRECASA THEY WALKED OVER THE GREAT BEDS OF LAVA THAT HAD DEMOLISHED THE TOWN
THERE WAS NO REAL DANGER UNCLE JOHN SCRATCHED HIS HEAD REFLECTIVELY I TAKE IT HE OBSERVED THAT THE MORAL OF YOUR STORY IS TO LIGHT OUT WHILE WE HAVE THE CHANCE
THE AUTHOR IS PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT A SEQUEL TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES THE BOOK WHICH WAS RECEIVED WITH SO MUCH FAVOR LAST YEAR YET IT IS NOT NECESSARY ONE SHOULD HAVE READ THE FIRST BOOK TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT VOLUME
THEN HE REMARKED THAT THE ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS WAS WANING AND THE TROUBLE NEARLY OVER FOR THIS TIME
NOW A HOTEL MUCH FAVORED BY THE TOURIST COUNT FERRALTI PROMISED TO JOIN THEM LATER AND RODE ON TO THE TOWN TO FIND A SURGEON TO LOOK AFTER HIS INJURED HAND WHILE THE OTHERS SLOWLY MOUNTED THE LONG INCLINES LEADING IN A ZIGZAG FASHION UP TO THE OLD MONASTERY
IT HAD BEAUTIFUL CAREFULLY BRUSHED CUSHIONS IT WAS DRAWN BY A PAIR OF SPLENDID LOOKING HORSES IS NOT BELLISSIMA SIGNORE ASKED THE MAN PROUDLY
TO ESTABLISH FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH HIS GIRLS NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST HE WANDERED THROUGH THE LOBBY AND PAUSED AT THE LITTLE OFFICE WHERE HE DISCOVERED THAT THE PROPRIETOR OF THIS HOTEL WAS A BROTHER OF THAT FLORIANO WHO MANAGED THE HOTEL DU VESUVE
AND THE RESULT IS AN ACCUMULATION OF ALL THIS DREADFUL MONEY SO MY DEAR MAJOR
ASIDE FROM THE GENERAL TROUBLE WHICH A WOMAN TAKES WITH HER EVERYWHERE MARY WOULD NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE CREATURE ON SHIPBOARD THERE IS ANOTHER AND GREATER OBJECTION IT IS SAID YOU KNOW AMONG SAILORS
THIS WAS COMFORTING IF NOT SATISFYING AND LOOSENED MY TONGUE JANE YOU KNOW MY HEART IS FULL OF LOVE FOR YOU
THAT IS UNTIL THE RIGHT ONE SHOULD COME THE RIGHT ONE IS ALWAYS ON HIS WAY AND FIRST OR LAST IS SURE TO COME TO EVERY WOMAN SOMETIMES ALAS TOO LATE
WHICH WAS STRIVING TO REASSERT ITSELF AND THE DESIRE TO SEE BRANDON BEGAN TO GET THE BETTER OF HER SENSE OF INJURY BRANDON TIRED OF THIS EVERLASTING WATCHFULNESS TO KEEP HIMSELF OUT OF TEMPTATION AND DREADING AT ANY MOMENT THAT LAPSE FROM STRENGTH
AS NEITHER HIS DUTIES NOR MINE WERE ONEROUS WE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ON OUR HANDS WHICH WE EMPLOYED WALKING AND RIDING OR SITTING IN OUR COMMON ROOM READING AND TALKING OF COURSE AS WITH MOST YOUNG MEN
SOON BEGAN TO WORK UPON HER NERVES AND MAKE HER FEARFUL THE ROAD WAS FULL OF DANGERS ASIDE FROM STUMBLING HORSES AND BROKEN NECKS FOR MANY WERE THE STORIES OF MURDER AND ROBBERY COMMITTED ALONG THE ROUTE THEY WERE TRAVELING IT IS TRUE THEY HAD TWO STOUT MEN AND ALL WERE ARMED YET THEY MIGHT EASILY COME UPON A PARTY TOO STRONG FOR THEM
I CAN NOT SAY WHETHER SHE KNEW BRANDON WAS THERE OR NOT BUT SHE WAS THERE AND HE WAS THERE WHICH IS THE ONLY THING TO THE POINT AND FINDING HIM SHE STEPPED INTO THE ALCOVE BEFORE HE WAS AWARE OF HER PRESENCE
YET LOVE HAD BLINDED HER WHERE BRANDON WAS CONCERNED AND THAT KNOWLEDGE FAILED TO GIVE HER LIGHT AS TO HIS MOTIVES HOWEVER BRIGHTLY IT MIGHT ILLUMINE THE CONDUCT OF OTHER MEN TOWARD WHOM SHE WAS INDIFFERENT
BY THAT TIME MARY HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE NOTE IN HER BOSOM SO WHEN JANE BEGAN TO ARRAY HER FOR THE DANCE IT FELL TO THE FLOOR WHEREUPON BOTH GIRLS BROKE INTO A LAUGH AND JANE KISSED MARY'S BARE SHOULDER AND MARY KISSED THE TOP OF JANE'S HEAD AND THEY WERE FRIENDS AGAIN
WHAT HE OR ANY ONE ELSE MIGHT SEE LOVE LYING IN HER HEART HAD MADE HER A LITTLE MORE SHY THAN FORMERLY IN SEEKING HIM BUT HER STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY OF TAKING WHATEVER SHE WANTED
TO DO THEIR PART AT THAT MARY WAS PROBABLY AS GOOD A FIGHTER IN HER OWN WAY AS ONE COULD FIND IN A LONG JOURNEY
THEY SAY BUCKINGHAM IS BESIDE HIMSELF FOR LOVE OF HER HE HAS A WIFE AT HOME IF I AM RIGHT AND IS OLD ENOUGH TO BE HER FATHER IS HE NOT I ASSENTED AND BRANDON CONTINUED
AND WHEN I FIRST SAW SIGNS OF A GROWING INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM I FELT FROM WHAT LITTLE I HAD SEEN OF BRANDON THAT THE TABLES WERE VERY LIKELY TO BE TURNED UPON HER LADYSHIP THEN THOUGHT I GOD HELP HER
TELL ME NOW AND SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM HALF IN BANTER HALF IN DOUBT MY DUTIES BEGAN BRANDON OH BOTHER YOUR DUTIES TELL ME THE TRUTH I WILL IF YOU LET ME
THE MEN OF THE COURT MUST BE POOR CREATURES HE HAD MUCH TO LEARN ABOUT THE POWER OF WOMANHOOD THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH BUT YOU KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT IT AS I DO WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE HER I ANSWERED
AND I HEARD HER NERVOUS LITTLE LAUGH AS SHE NODDED HER HEAD YES AND STEPPED CLOSER TO HIM TO TAKE POSITION FOR THE DANCE THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS IN BRANDON'S ARMS FLYING LIKE A SYLPH ABOUT THE ROOM A BUZZ OF ASTONISHMENT AND DELIGHT
BUT THE THREAD IN THE FORELOCK TOLD US OUR FRIENDS HAD FOUND EACH OTHER WHEN WE LEFT THE CASTLE MARY WORE UNDER HER RIDING HABIT A SUIT OF MAN'S ATTIRE AND AS WE RODE ALONG SHE WOULD SHRUG HER SHOULDERS AND LAUGH AS IF IT WERE A HUGE JOKE
THE KING DID NOT OPEN THESE PRIVATE BALLS AS HE WAS SUPPOSED AT LEAST NOT TO BE THEIR PATRON AND THE QUEEN WHO WAS CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN HENRY WAS AVERSE TO SUCH THINGS SO THE PRINCESS OPENED HER OWN BALLS
TO HER WHOM HIS LOVE SHOULD HAVE PROMPTED HIM TO SAVE AT ALL COST IF MARY COULD ONLY HAVE DISGUISED HERSELF TO LOOK LIKE A MAN THEY MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED
AND THE GENTLEMEN ON THE POOP MADE NO EFFORT TO HIDE THEIR AMUSEMENT OLD BRADHURST STEPPED UP TO HER I HOPE YOUR LORDSHIP IS FEELING BETTER
LATER IN LIFE THE HIGH ROAD TO HIS FAVOR WAS IN RIDDING HIM OF HIS WIFE AND HELPING HIM TO A NEW ONE A DANGEROUS WAY THOUGH AS WOLSEY FOUND TO HIS SORROW WHEN HE SANK HIS GLORY IN POOR ANNE BOLEYN
TOO KEEN AN INSIGHT FOR THE TRUTH OFTEN STANDS IN A MAN'S WAY AND TOO CLEAR A VIEW OF AN OVERWHELMING OBSTACLE IS APT TO PARALYZE EFFORT HOPE MUST ALWAYS BE BEHIND A HEARTY ENDEAVOR
I THOUGHT I HAD REACHED THE PINNACLE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND PAIN WHEN COMPELLED TO LEAVE THE SHIP FOR IT MEANT THAT I SHOULD LOSE YOU AND HAVE TO MARRY LOUIS OF FRANCE BUT I HAVE FOUND THAT THERE IS STILL A POSSIBLE PAIN MORE POIGNANT THAN EITHER AND I CANNOT BEAR IT
SHE MIGHT HAVE TO SPEAK FIRST OR THERE MIGHT BE NO SPEAKING FROM ONE WHO THOUGHT HIS POSITION TOO FAR BENEATH HERS SHE WHOSE SMALLEST DESIRES DRIVE HER SO WILL NEVER FOREGO SO GREAT A THING AS THE MAN SHE LOVES ONLY FOR THE WANT OF A WORD OR TWO
ALL THAT HE HAD HEARD OF HER WONDERFUL POWER OVER MEN
WHEN SHE SANK SHE TOUCHED THE BOTTOM ALAS MARY THE UNCONQUERABLE WAS DOWN AT LAST THIS FAILURE MEANT SO MUCH TO HER IT MEANT THAT SHE WOULD NEVER BE BRANDON'S WIFE BUT WOULD GO TO FRANCE TO ENDURE THE DREADED OLD FRENCHMAN
AS THE BOAT PUT OFF AGAIN FOR THE SHIP ITS CREW GAVE A CHEER COUPLED WITH SOME VILE ADVICE FOR WHICH BRANDON WOULD GLADLY HAVE RUN THEM THROUGH EACH AND EVERY ONE
AND THE MEN AT THE OARS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER ASKANCE AND SMILED WHAT A PREDICAMENT FOR A PRINCESS BRANDON CURSED HIMSELF FOR HAVING BEEN SUCH A KNAVE AND FOOL AS TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN
IT IS NOT MY PLACE TO DETERMINE SUCH MATTERS I AM SURE HOWEVER SHE IS NOT HERE FOR I DOUBT NOT SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN A GENTLE ANSWER TO A MESSAGE FROM THE QUEEN I SHALL CONTINUE MY SEARCH WITH THIS
AND STRANGELY ENOUGH SOMETIMES TOLD HIM IN A FIT OF SHORT LIVED QUICKLY REPENTED ANGER THAT ALWAYS SET HIM LAUGHING YET THERE WAS NEVER A WORD OR GESTURE THAT COULD HINT OF UNDUE FAMILIARITY IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MET A REBUFF FROM THE PRINCESS PART OF HER
THAT IS BETWEEN OURSELVES OF WHAT USE IS IT TO ARGUE THE EQUALITY OF HUMAN KIND TO A MAN WHO HONESTLY THINKS HE IS BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE OR TO ONE WHO REALLY BELIEVES THAT SOME ONE ELSE IS BETTER THAN HE
IN THE FRUCTIFYING LIGHT OF HER SWEET FACE AND THE NURTURING WARMTH OF HER PURE SOUL WHAT A BLESSED THING IT IS FOR A MAN TO LOVE HIS WIFE AND BE SATISFIED WITH HER
SHE THEN LED HIM TO THE KING AND QUEEN TO WHOM HE MADE HIS BOW
AND WAS SOON LOST TO SIGHT BEHIND THE SHRUBBERY AT THE TURNING OF THE WALK IN A SHORT TIME WE CAME TO A SUMMER HOUSE NEAR THE MARBLE BOAT LANDING
THAT ARE TIDY ENOUGH BUT THIS ONE WAS A LITTLE OFF THE MAIN ROAD SELECTED FOR THAT REASON AND THE UNCLEANNESS WAS NOT THE LEAST OF MARY'S TRIALS THAT HARD NIGHT SHE HAD NOT TASTED FOOD SINCE NOON AND FELT THE KEEN HUNGER NATURAL TO YOUTH AND HEALTH SUCH AS HERS
MARY COULD NOT AND CERTAINLY WOULD NOT MARRY HIM EVEN IF SHE LOVED HIM WITH ALL HER HEART THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT AND SHE KNEW TOO WELL WHAT SHE OWED TO HER POSITION THERE WAS BUT ONE THING LEFT
THEN OF COURSE AFTER THESE LAST TWO MEETINGS ALTHOUGH THE INVITATIONS CAME FREQUENTLY NONE WAS ACCEPTED BRANDON HAD CONTRIVED TO HAVE HIS DUTIES OSTENSIBLY AT LEAST OCCUPY HIS EVENINGS
I FEAR I TRIED TO CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS HER EXALTED RANK ONLY WHICH MADE HER LOOK UNFAVORABLY UPON MY PASSION
AFTER WE HAD ALL RETURNED TO GREENWICH THE PRINCESS AND BRANDON WERE TOGETHER FREQUENTLY UPON SEVERAL OCCASIONS HE WAS INVITED WITH OTHERS TO HER PARLOR FOR CARD PLAYING BUT WE SPENT TWO EVENINGS WITH ONLY FOUR OF US PRESENT
SO JANE HALTED MY EFFORT TO POUR OUT MY HEART AS SHE ALWAYS DID THERE IS SOMETHING THAT GREATLY TROUBLES ME SHE SAID WHAT IS IT I ASKED IN SOME CONCERN
A MAN LOVES A WOMAN WHO IS SO THOROUGHLY WOMANLY THAT NOTHING CAN HIDE IT MARY WAS PLEASED AT HIS FLATTERY BUT DISAPPOINTED AT THE FAILURE IN HERSELF SHE HAD THOUGHT THAT SURELY THESE GARMENTS WOULD MAKE A MAN OF HER IN WHICH THE KEENEST EYE COULD NOT DETECT A FLAW
HER SKIN WAS LIKE VELVET A RICH CLEAR ROSY SNOW WITH THE HOT YOUNG BLOOD GLOWING THROUGH IT LIKE THE FAINT RED TINGE WE SOMETIMES SEE ON THE INNER SIDE OF A WHITE ROSE LEAF
SHE WAS A PRINCESS TO WHOM ALL THE WORLD BOWED DOWN YET THAT DID NOT HELP HER HERE AFTER ALL SHE WAS ONLY A GIRL TIMID AND FEARFUL FOLLOWING AT BRANDON'S HEELS
NEITHER DID HE DAMPEN HER SPIRITS BY TELLING HER THAT THERE WAS A REASON OUTSIDE OF HIMSELF WHICH IN ALL PROBABILITY WOULD HELP HIM IN KEEPING HIS WORD AND SAVE HER FROM THE PANGS OF THAT JEALOUSY SHE SO MUCH FEARED NAMELY
WHEREAS NO ONE COULD TELL THE LIABILITIES OF A GENTLEMAN OF HIGH STANDING BURGO FITZGERALD WAS A GENTLEMAN OF HIGH STANDING AND HIS CREDITORS WOULD HAVE SWALLOWED UP EVERY SHILLING THAT MISSUS GREENOW POSSESSED BUT WITH CAPTAIN BELLFIELD SHE WAS COMPARATIVELY SAFE
PERHAPS YOU'LL COME WITH ME TO THIS PROPOSITION MISTER GREY ASSENTED SOMETIMES YOU KNOW CONTINUED MISTER PALLISER THE SPRINGS OF THE CARRIAGES ARE SO VERY ROUGH THEN IN A VERY FEW WORDS
IT MAY BE ALSO THAT HE HIMSELF WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW MEN LOOKED WHEN THEY LOST THEIR OWN MONEY OR WON THAT OF OTHERS HE KNEW HOW A MINISTER LOOKED WHEN HE LOST OR GAINED A TAX
IT WAS NOT OF THOSE THINGS THAT SHE WAS AFRAID SHE HAD A WOMAN'S TRUE BELIEF IN HER OWN POWER AND THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD CURE THEM AS FAR AS THEY NEEDED CURE AS FOR HIS STORIES ABOUT INKERMAN AND HIS LITTLE DEBTS SHE CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
MISTER PALLISER WHO WAS BEHIND HER COULD NOT SEE THEM AT ALL BUT TO ALICE AND TO MISTER GREY HAD HE CARED ABOUT IT EVERY FACE AT THE TABLE WAS VISIBLE EXCEPT THE FACES OF THOSE WHO WERE IMMEDIATELY CLOSE TO THEM
IT IS TRUE BELLFIELD MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FORGER OR A THIEF OR A RETURNED CONVICT BUT THEN HIS DEBTS COULD NOT BE LARGE LET HIM HAVE DONE HIS BEST
BELLFIELD DID IT CHEAPER OF COURSE HE TRAVELLED SECOND CLASS I HEARD OF HIM AS I CAME ALONG THE EXPENSE DOES NOT MATTER TO YOU MISTER CHEESACRE TO THIS HE ASSENTED AND THEN TOOK HIS LEAVE
HE TOLD HER ALSO THAT ALICE HAD YIELDED AT LAST OF COURSE SHE HAS SAID LADY GLENCORA I REALLY DIDN'T THINK SHE WOULD SAID HE THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS OF THAT SORT SAID HIS WIFE
HE DID NOT TRY TO HIDE HIS ANXIETY AND WHEN AFTER THE TELLING OF SOME SIX OR SEVEN CARDS HE HEARD A CERTAIN NUMBER NAMED AND A CERTAIN COLOUR CALLED HE MADE SOME EXCLAMATION WHICH EVEN GLENCORA COULD NOT HEAR
TO SEND SOME POLITICAL AGENT OVER TO FRANCE TO WHICH LORD BROCK WOULD NOT AGREE AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS DISAGREEMENT HERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER CHANCE IF ONLY MISTER PALLISER COULD GIVE UP HIS WINTER IN ITALY
I THINK YOU LOVE ME YOUR WOMAN'S PRIDE TOWARDS ME HAS BEEN GREAT AND GOOD AND WOMANLY BUT IT HAS HAD ITS WAY AND IF YOU LOVE ME MIGHT NOW BE TAUGHT TO SUCCUMB DEAR ALICE WILL YOU BE MY WIFE
TOGETHER IN SO VERY PUBLIC A PLACE BUT THEY WERE ONLY JUST IN TIME TO ESCAPE THE VIGILANT EYES OF A NEW VISITOR ROUND THE CORNER OF THE ROAD AT A SHARP TROT CAME THE SHAP POST HORSE WITH THE SHAP GIG BEHIND HIM
WITH THESE MONEYS THERE HAD BEEN NO DECEIT AT ANY RATE IN REFERENCE TO THE POUNDS STERLING WHICH SCRUBY HAD ALREADY SWALLOWED THEY HAD BEEN SUPPLIED WHATEVER HAD BEEN THE MOTIVES OF THE SUPPLIERS AND HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT MORE WOULD BE SUPPLIED
AND THEN ANOTHER CROUPIER PUT DOWN CLOSE TO BURGO'S MONEY CERTAIN ROLLS OF GOLD DONE UP IN PAPER AND ALSO CERTAIN LOOSE NAPOLEONS WHY DOESN'T HE TAKE IT SAID LADY GLENCORA HE IS TAKING IT SAID ALICE
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GOOD REASON FOR REFUSING HIS OFFER WHEN HE FIRST MADE IT BUT IT CAN BE NO EXCUSE FOR UNTRUTH NOW THAT SHE HAS TOLD HIM THAT SHE LOVES HIM IF A WOMAN SHE HAD SAID AGAIN WON'T VENTURE HER FORTUNE FOR THE MAN SHE LOVES HER LOVE IS NOT WORTH HAVING
FOUR CORNERS AND AT THE CORNER APPROPRIATED BY THEM THEY WERE PARTLY OPPOSITE TO THE MAN WHO DEALT THE CARDS THE CORNER ANSWERING TO THEIRS AT THE OTHER END WAS THE PART OF THE TABLE MOST REMOVED FROM THEIR SIGHT
ALL MIGHT SEE THAT HE LEFT ITS POSITION TO CHANCE ONE PIECE HAD GOT BEYOND ITS BOUNDARY AND THE CROUPIER PUSHED IT BACK WITH SOME HALF EXPRESSED INQUIRY AS TO HIS CORRECTNESS ALL RIGHT
WHY MISTER CHEESACRE I AM QUITE SURE SHE NEVER GAVE YOU A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT IN HER LIFE BUT YOU ALWAYS TOLD ME I MIGHT HAVE HER FOR THE ASKING AND NOW I TELL YOU THAT YOU MAYN'T IT'S OF NO USE YOUR GOING ON THERE TO ASK HER
UNLESS IT WAS HIS HEART YOU KNOW MA'AM BUT WHY SHOULD THEY QUARREL AT ALL JEANNETTE IT IS THE MOST FOOLISH THING WELL MA'AM I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT WHAT ELSE IS THEY TO DO THERE'S SOME THINGS AS YOU CAN CRY HALVES ABOUT
AND AS FOR MONEY WHAT'S THE GOOD OF HAVING MORE THAN ENOUGH IF HE CAN BRING LOVE YOU CAN BRING MONEY CAN'T YOU MA'AM HE'S NOTHING TO ME GIRL REPEATED MISSUS GREENOW BUT HE WILL BE SAID JEANNETTE PLAINLY ASKING A QUESTION WELL I'M SURE
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH I CAN BE PRESENT AND IF WE CAN BESPEAK SOME SUN WE'LL HAVE THE BREAKFAST OUT IN THE RUINS ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THEY ALL STARTED TOGETHER A FIRST CLASS COMPARTMENT HAVING BEEN TAKEN FOR THE PALLISER FAMILY
BUT NEVERTHELESS HE DRESSED HIMSELF WITH CONSIDERABLE CARE
AND A SECOND CLASS COMPARTMENT CLOSE TO THEM FOR THE PALLISER SERVANTS MISTER PALLISER AS HE SLOWLY HANDED HIS WIFE IN WAS A TRIUMPHANT MAN AS WAS ALSO MISTER GREY AS HE HANDED IN HIS LADY LOVE
JEANNETTE I WONDER HOW YOU CAN SAY SUCH THINGS AS IF I IN MY POSITION HAD EVER SAID A WORD TO ENCOURAGE EITHER OF THEM YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE JEANNETTE AND YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SO WHEREUPON MISSUS GREENOW PUT HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES
BECAUSE I WAS SO FRIGHTENED WHEN I FOUND THAT I WAS WINNING MISTER PALLISER WAS AWARE THAT ALL THE WORLD OF BADEN OR RATHER THE WORLD OF THE STRANGERS AT BADEN ASSEMBLES ITSELF IN THOSE SALONS
THROUGH THE HANDS OF JOHN GREY HE DID NOT CARE MUCH TO CALCULATE WHETHER THE PAYMENTS HAD BEEN MADE FROM THE PERSONAL FUNDS OF HIS RIVAL OR WHETHER THAT RIVAL HAD BEEN EMPLOYED TO DISPENSE ALICE'S FORTUNE UNDER EITHER VIEW OF THE CASE HIS POSITION WAS SUFFICIENTLY BITTER
BUT SHE HAD BEEN VERY EARNEST IN DECLARING THAT IT WAS GLENCORA'S DUTY TO STAND BY HER PROMISE TO BURGO HE IS A DESPERATE SPENDTHRIFT KATE VAVASOR HAD SAID TO HER THEN LET HER TEACH HIM TO BE OTHERWISE ALICE HAD ANSWERED
IT CREATED A LITTLE JOINT STOCK FUND OF MERRIMENT BETWEEN THE WHOLE PARTY WHICH WAS VERY MUCH NEEDED THE ABSENCE OF SUCH JOINT STOCK FUND IS ALWAYS FELT WHEN A SMALL PARTY IS THROWN TOGETHER WITHOUT SUCH ASSISTANCE SOME BOND IS NECESSARY ON THESE OCCASIONS
DO I FLATTER MYSELF WHEN I FEEL THAT I DOUBT YOUR PARDON ALMOST MORE THAN I DOUBT YOUR LOVE THINK OF THIS THING IN ALL ITS BEARINGS BEFORE YOU ANSWER ME I AM SO ANXIOUS THAT YOU SHOULD THINK OF IT THAT I WILL NOT EXPECT YOUR REPLY TILL THIS DAY WEEK
BEEN MORE PRONE TO HIM THAN TO THAT OTHER SUITOR GREY AS HE THOUGHT HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY HER COLD PRUDENCE BUT HE THOUGHT ALSO THAT SHE HAD FOUND HER PRUDENCE TO BE TOO COLD
WHICH LAY UPON THE TABLE PUSHED THREE OR FOUR OF THEM ON TO ONE OF THE DIVISIONS MARKED ON THE CLOTH HE SEEMED TO SHOW NO CARE AS OTHERS DID AS TO THE SPECIAL SPOT WHICH THEY SHOULD OCCUPY MANY WERE VERY PARTICULAR IN THIS RESPECT
HE'S WANTED BY THE POLICE MISSUS GREENOW AND IN HIS ARDOUR HE STOOD UP IN THE GIG AND POINTED AT BELLFIELD
IN HAVING ADMITTED HIS ENEMY INTO HIS LODGINGS HE WAS SURE THAT NO GOOD COULD COME OF IT AND REMEMBERED WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE THAT HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE SAVED HIMSELF FROM GIVING THE INVITATION WHILE HE WAS STILL IN THE STREET
MISTER GREY SHOULD ORDER IT THEN SHE LAUGHED AT HERSELF AGAIN WITH THAT INWARD LAUGHTER AND RISING FROM HER SEAT PROCEEDED TO WALK DOWN THE HILL TO THE HOTEL VANQUISHED AT LAST SAID LADY GLENCORA AS ALICE ENTERED THE ROOM
THOUGH NO CONSIDERATION WOULD INDUCE HER TO STIR A HAIR'S BREADTH TOWARDS DANGER IN REPUTATION TOWARDS TEACHING HER THAT DOCTRINE AT WHICH I HAVE HINTED HE WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT
NO ONE DISTURBED HER IN THE CHURCHYARD NO STEPS WERE HEARD ALONG THE TOMBSTONES NO VOICE SOUNDED THROUGH THE CLOISTERS SHE WAS LEFT IN PERFECT SOLITUDE TO THINK OF THE PAST AND FORM HER PLANS OF THE FUTURE WAS SHE HAPPY
BY THE NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION SOME EMPLOYMENT WAS NECESSARY TO HIM HE WAS LOOKING TO THE CORDING OF THE BOXES GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HE SAID TO GREY HARDLY LOOKING AT HIM AS THOUGH TIME WERE TOO PRECIOUS WITH HIM TO ALLOW OF HIS TURNING HIS EYES UPON HIS FRIEND
I'M NOT ONE TO INTRUDE WHERE I'M NOT WANTED YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT IF I CAN'T GET MY SUPPER FOR LOVE I CAN GET AT FOR MONEY
BURGO LOOKED UP AND SMILED AT THEM ALL ROUND THE TABLE BY THIS TIME MOST OF THOSE WHO STOOD AROUND WERE LOOKING AT HIM HE WAS A MAN WHO GATHERED EYES UPON HIM WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE
ASKED THE BOY'S MASTER JEM SCRUTINIZED THE COIN AND DECLARED THAT THE UPPERMOST SURFACE SHOWED A TAIL THEN TAKE THAT LETTER AND POST IT SAID GEORGE VAVASOR WHEREUPON JEM ASKING NO QUESTION AND THINKING BUT LITTLE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE COMMAND WAS GIVEN
NOW THAT THE MANNER OF HER LIFE TO COME WAS THUS SETTLED FOR HER THAT ALL FURTHER QUESTION AS TO THE DISPOSAL OF HERSELF WAS TAKEN OUT OF HER HANDS AND THAT HER MARRIAGE WITH A MAN SHE LOVED WAS SO FIRMLY ARRANGED THAT NO FURTHER FOLLY OF HER OWN COULD DISARRANGE IT
AS HARDLY ANY WOMAN HAD EVER LIED BEFORE OR COULD IT BE THAT KATE ALSO WAS LYING TO HIM IF SO KATE ALSO SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE PUNISHMENT BUT WHY SHOULD THEY HAVE CONSPIRED TO FEED HIM
THEN WHEN THE HOUR WAS NEARLY OVER HE READ IT AGAIN I'LL BET TWO TO ONE THAT SHE GIVES WAY HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE PUT THE SHEET OF PAPER BACK INTO THE ENVELOPE WOMEN ARE SUCH OUT AND OUT FOOLS THEN HE TOOK HIS CANDLE AND CARRYING HIS LETTER WITH HIM WENT INTO HIS BEDROOM
HAVING FIRST FORTIFIED HIMSELF WITH A MEDICAL OPINION AS TO THE FITNESS OF THE DRINK FOR A LADY IN HER CONDITION THERE WAS NO EXPENDITURE THAT HE WOULD NOT WILLINGLY INCUR FOR HER NOTHING COSTLY THAT HE WOULD GRUDGE
MY SISTER LITTLE MARGERY
MINGLED WITH A CERTAIN ANGER AT THE INGRATITUDE OF THE CREATURE TO WHOM HE HAD BEEN SO KIND BUT AT BREAK OF DAY HE ROSE DETERMINED AGAIN TO PURSUE HER
THEY TALKED A LITTLE WHILE TOGETHER AND THEN RETURNED TO THE PALACE WHERE THE PAGE ASSISTED HER TO MOUNT HER HORSE ON WHICH SHE LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL THAT ALL THE NEW QUEEN'S SPLENDOURS FADED INTO NOTHING IN COMPARISON AND NOT ONE OF THE COURTIERS HAD EYES FOR ANY EXCEPT GRACIOSA
THE KING NOTICED HER MORE AND MORE HE SPOKE LESS AND LESS OF THE DEPARTED QUEEN BY AND BY HE CEASED TO SPEAK OF HER AT ALL THE END WAS THAT HE COURTED THE INCONSOLABLE LADY IN THE BLACK VEIL AND MARRIED HER
BUT HE WENT RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET WITH ONE SLIPPER AND ONE SOCK ON HE HAD ON HIS LEATHER APRON IN ONE HAND HE CARRIED THE GOLD CHAIN AND IN THE OTHER THE PINCERS WHILE THE SUN SHONE BRIGHTLY UP THE STREET
THIS TIME SHE SAID HOW IS MY BABY HOW IS MY ROE I CAN COME BUT THIS ONCE THEN FOR EVER MUST GO UPON WHICH THE KING COULD NO LONGER CONTAIN HIMSELF BUT SPRANG FORWARD AND CRIED
IT IS BETTER OF THE TWO TO HAVE THE HEART OF A MAN AND THE FORM OF A MONSTER I WOULD THANK YOU BEAUTY FOR THIS SPEECH BUT I AM TOO SENSELESS TO SAY ANYTHING THAT WOULD PLEASE YOU RETURNED THE BEAST IN A MELANCHOLY VOICE
NOW THE YOUNG LADY WAS SO STUPID THAT SHE THOUGHT A YEAR'S END WAS A LONG WAY OFF SO LONG THAT IT SEEMED AS IF IT MIGHT NOT COME AT ALL OR SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN BETWEEN WHILES
WILL YOU CONVEY ME TO THE PALACE OF KING CHARMING THE OBEDIENT PIGEONS DID SO FLYING DAY AND NIGHT TILL THEY REACHED THE CITY GATES WHEN THE QUEEN DISMISSED THEM WITH A SWEET KISS WHICH WAS WORTH MORE THAN HER CROWN
FROM HIS HANDS IT DID NOT SEEM SO TERRIBLE AS FROM ANY ONE ELSE BUT INSTEAD OF KILLING HER HE CARESSED HER BEAUTIFUL HIND SAID HE DO NOT BE AFRAID I ONLY WISH TO TAKE YOU HOME WITH ME AND HAVE YOU WITH ME ALWAYS
THE CREATURE WALKED UP TO HER AND EYED HER ALL OVER THEN ASKED HER IN A DREADFUL VOICE IF SHE HAD COME QUITE OF HER OWN ACCORD YES SAID BEAUTY THEN YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL AND I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
JUST AS IF THE TREE WERE CLAPPING ITS HANDS FOR JOY AFTER THAT THERE WENT UP FROM IT A SORT OF MIST AND RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF THE MIST BURNT A FIRE AND OUT OF THE FIRE
SNOWDROP BEING SO HUNGRY AND THIRSTY ATE A LITTLE OF THE VEGETABLES AND BREAD ON EACH PLATE AND DRANK A DROP OF WINE FROM EVERY CUP FOR SHE DID NOT LIKE TO EMPTY ONE ENTIRELY THEN BEING VERY TIRED SHE LAID HERSELF DOWN IN ONE OF THE BEDS
AND WENT AND SAT BEFORE THE GOLDSMITH AND SANG MY MOTHER SHE KILLED ME MY FATHER HE ATE ME MY SISTER LITTLE MARGERY GATHERED UP ALL MY BONES
WISH THAT I MAY NOW AND THEN HAVE A SMALL SHARE IN YOUR REMEMBRANCE SO SAYING HE GALLOPED AWAY AND SOON ENTERED INTO THE THICKEST PART OF A WOOD NEAR A RIVER
BUT WHEN SHE RECOLLECTED HERSELF AND WISHED TO GET THEM INTO THE BOX AGAIN THEY ALL SCAMPERED AWAY
AND CRIED SISTER OPEN THE DOOR I MUST GO HIS SISTER OPENED THE DOOR AND SAID BUT MIND YOU MUST BE BACK IN THE EVENING AND MAKE YOUR LITTLE SPEECH THAT I MAY LET YOU IN WHEN THE KING AND HIS HUNTSMEN SAW THE WHITE ROE WITH THE GOLD BAND ONCE MORE
ALAS SHE CRIED MY BLUE BIRD HAS FORSAKEN ME SHE NEITHER ATE NOR SLEPT BUT ROSE WITH THE DAWN AND PUSHED HER WAY THROUGH THE GUARDS TO THE TEMPLE WHERE SHE SAW TWO THRONES ONE FOR KING CHARMING
WITHOUT REFLECTING ON THE CONSEQUENCES SHE LIFTED UP THE LID AND INSTANTLY THERE JUMPED OUT A NUMBER OF LITTLE MEN AND LITTLE WOMEN CARRYING LITTLE TABLES AND CHAIRS LITTLE DISHES AND LITTLE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
IN THIS COSTUME SHE WISHED TO ENTER THE CITY ON HORSEBACK AS SHE UNDERSTOOD THE QUEENS WERE IN THE HABIT OF DOING MEANTIME
BUT STILL WITHOUT SEEING A SINGLE CREATURE HE WENT ON TO A LARGE DINING PARLOUR WHERE HE FOUND A GOOD FIRE AND A TABLE COVERED WITH SOME VERY NICE DISHES BUT ONLY ONE PLATE WITH A KNIFE AND FORK
IN THE EVENING WHEN HE WAS COME HOME AND HEARD THAT HE HAD A LITTLE SON HE WAS VERY MUCH DELIGHTED AND WISHED TO VISIT HIS DEAR WIFE AND SEE HOW SHE WAS GETTING ON ON WHICH THE OLD WOMAN CRIED OUT IN A GREAT HURRY AS YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE DON'T TOUCH THE CURTAIN
FOR ENVY GAVE HER NO REST DAY OR NIGHT WHILE SHE HERSELF WAS NOT THE FAIREST LADY IN THE LAND WHEN SHE HAD PLANNED WHAT TO DO SHE PAINTED HER FACE DRESSED HERSELF LIKE AN OLD PEDLAR WOMAN AND ALTERED HER APPEARANCE SO MUCH THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE KNOWN HER
SHE WAS DRESSED LIKE ANY POOR PEASANT IN A COTTON GOWN A WOOLLEN HOOD AND WOODEN SHOES YET AS SHE WALKED ALONG PEOPLE TOOK HER FOR A QUEEN IN DISGUISE SO LOVELY WERE HER LOOKS AND WAYS BUT BEING WEAK WITH IMPRISONMENT SHE SOON GREW WEARY
MADE ALL SORTS OF INQUIRIES AND DISCOVERED THAT GILLIFLOWER WAS LODGED IN THE NEXT ROOM I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER AGAIN THOUGHT HE AND SINCE ONLY A THIN PARTITION DIVIDES US I WILL BORE A HOLE THROUGH HE DID SO
I ASKED HIM TO GIVE ME THE APPLE BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER ME AND I WAS FRIGHTENED GO TO HIM AGAIN SAID HER MOTHER AND IF HE WILL NOT ANSWER YOU GIVE HIM A BOX ON THE EAR
THIS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER WAS NOT ONLY MORE HANDSOME THAN HER SISTERS BUT ALSO WAS BETTER TEMPERED THE TWO ELDEST WERE VAIN OF THEIR WEALTH AND POSITION THEY GAVE THEMSELVES A THOUSAND AIRS AND REFUSED TO VISIT OTHER MERCHANTS DAUGHTERS
HOW IS MY BABY HOW IS MY ROE I CAN COME BUT ONCE MORE THEN FOR EVER MUST GO AND NURSED AND FONDLED THE BABY AS BEFORE THEN VANISHED THE KING DID NOT DARE TO ADDRESS HER BUT WATCHED AGAIN THE FOLLOWING NIGHT
SHE SPENT EIGHT DAYS IN HIS PALACE DAYS FULL OF EVERY ENJOYMENT AND PERCINET TRIED ALL THE ARGUMENTS HE COULD THINK OF TO INDUCE HER TO MARRY HIM AND REMAIN THERE FOR EVER
IT RAINED AND SNOWED VERY HARD AND BESIDES THE WIND WAS SO HIGH AS TO THROW HIM TWICE FROM HIS HORSE NIGHT CAME ON AND HE FEARED HE SHOULD DIE OF COLD AND HUNGER OR BE TORN TO PIECES BY THE WOLVES THAT HE HEARD HOWLING ROUND HIM
THEY CAME AT LAST TO A LITTLE HOUSE INTO WHICH THE MAIDEN PEEPED AND AS IT WAS EMPTY SHE THOUGHT HERE WE MAY STAY AND LIVE SO SHE MADE A PRETTY BED OF LEAVES AND MOSS FOR THE ROE AND EVERY MORNING SHE WENT OUT AND GATHERED ROOTS BERRIES AND NUTS FOR HERSELF
SHE RELATED ALL TO THE QUEEN AND TROUTINA WHO CONCLUDED THAT THE BIRD COULD BE NO OTHER THAN KING CHARMING THEY SENT THE GIRL BACK TOLD HER TO EXPRESS NO CURIOSITY BUT TO FEIGN SLEEP
HE TERRIFIED HER MORE THAN EVER BY SAYING ABRUPTLY IN HIS GRUFF VOICE BEAUTY WILL YOU MARRY ME NOW BEAUTY FRIGHTENED AS SHE WAS WOULD SPEAK ONLY THE EXACT TRUTH BESIDES HER FATHER HAD TOLD HER THAT THE BEAST LIKED ONLY TO HAVE THE TRUTH SPOKEN TO HIM
MAKING A GOLD CHAIN BUT HE HEARD THE BIRD WHICH SAT ON HIS ROOF AND SANG AND HE THOUGHT IT VERY BEAUTIFUL HE STOOD UP AND AS HE WENT OVER THE DOOR STEP HE LOST ONE SLIPPER
IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BEFORE HE AWOKE WHEN HE WAS AMAZED TO SEE A HANDSOME NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES LAID READY FOR HIM INSTEAD OF HIS OWN WHICH WERE ALL TORN AND SPOILED TO BE SURE SAID HE TO HIMSELF
THEY WERE VERY FRIENDLY HOWEVER AND INQUIRED HER NAME SNOWDROP ANSWERED SHE HOW HAVE YOU FOUND YOUR WAY TO OUR HOUSE FURTHER ASKED THE DWARFS SO SHE TOLD THEM HOW HER STEPMOTHER HAD TRIED TO KILL HER HOW THE HUNTSMAN HAD SPARED HER LIFE
BUT STILL THEY HAD NONE IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE WAS A YARD WHERE STOOD A JUNIPER TREE AND UNDER IT THE WIFE STOOD ONCE IN WINTER AND PEELED AN APPLE
BEAUTY FULL OF SURPRISE BUT VERY HAPPY SUFFERED THE PRINCE TO LEAD HER TO HIS PALACE WHERE SHE FOUND HER FATHER AND SISTERS WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE BY THE FAIRY LADY WHOM SHE HAD SEEN IN A DREAM THE FIRST NIGHT SHE CAME
I WILL WAIT TILL I COME TO THE NEXT SPRING BUT THEN I MUST DRINK SAY WHAT YOU WILL FOR MY THIRST IS GETTING UNBEARABLE AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE THIRD SPRING THE LITTLE SISTER HEARD A VOICE IN ITS MURMUR SAYING WHOEVER DRINKS OF ME WILL BECOME A ROE AND SHE CRIED
THEY REACHED THE PALACE WHERE THE QUEEN AND HER TWO DAUGHTERS RECEIVED THE FORLORN PRINCESS WITH GREAT KINDNESS AND LED HER THROUGH MANY ROOMS OF ROCK CRYSTAL GLITTERING WITH JEWELS WHERE TO HER AMAZEMENT GRACIOSA SAW THE HISTORY OF HER OWN LIFE
AND TO GO TO BED EARLIER THAN USUAL THEN THE POOR DECEIVED PRINCESS OPENED HER LITTLE WINDOW AND SANG HER USUAL SONG BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD COME TO MY SIDE
AND SITTING DOWN UPON THE EDGE OF A LITTLE WOOD TOOK THE BOX UPON HER LAP SUDDENLY A WONDERFUL DESIRE SEIZED HER TO OPEN IT I WILL TAKE NOTHING OUT I WILL TOUCH NOTHING SAID SHE TO HERSELF BUT I MUST SEE WHAT IS INSIDE
SHE RECEIVED HIM CIVILLY AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED HE TRIED TO MAKE A BARGAIN WITH HER BUT COULD EFFECT NOTHING UNLESS KING CHARMING WOULD CONSENT TO MARRY TROUTINA THE ENCHANTER FOUND THIS BRIDE SO UGLY
ALL AT ONCE HE CAST HIS EYES TOWARDS A LONG AVENUE AND SAW AT THE END A LIGHT BUT IT SEEMED A GREAT WAY OFF HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY TOWARDS IT AND FOUND THAT IT CAME FROM A SPLENDID PALACE
ON THAT OCCASION MISTER TWEED WHO WAS EITHER INTOXICATED WITH LIQUOR OR INTOXICATED WITH PRIDE AND VANITY GROSSLY INSULTED MISTER TILDEN
FOR A CERTAIN CHURCH IN PENNSYLVANIA WHICH HAD BEEN GRIEVOUSLY EMBARRASSED HE STAYED AT THE HOUSE OF ONE OF THE MINISTERS IN BROOKLYN ONE EVENING HE SAID TO HIS HOST I AM GOING TO CALL ON SAMUEL J TILDEN AND SEE IF I CAN'T GET SOMETHING OUT OF HIM FOR OUR CHURCH HE HAS A BARREL
AND THE EFFECT WAS TO SOME EXTENT SIMILAR FOR EACH OF THESE MEN SAW BOTH SIDES OF EVERY QUESTION SO FULLY AS TO BE UNDER THE POWER OF BOTH SIDES WHICH SOMETIMES PRODUCED AN EQUILIBRIUM CAUSING HESITATION WHEN THE CRISIS REQUIRED ACTION
WHOM HE ALSO KNEW DID YOU EVER SEE THE OLD MAN SO NEARLY GONE AS HE WAS TO DAY DOES HE OFTEN GET SO HAD HE BEEN TAKING A DROP TOO MUCH HE WAS AT NO TIME IN HIS CAREER EMBARRASSED IN HIS INTELLECTUAL OPERATIONS BY HIS EMOTIONAL NATURE
THAN SAMUEL J TILDEN AT THAT TIME IT IS REMARKABLE THAT A MAN SO SILENT AND MYSTERIOUS NOT TO SAY REPELLENT IN HIS INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOW MEN COULD EXERT SUCH A MIGHTY INFLUENCE AS HE UNQUESTIONABLY DID HE DID IT BY CONTROLLING MASTER MINDS
AGAINST THE SCHEMES AND USURPATIONS OF ITS ACCIDENTAL OCCUPANT MISTER STANTON ENTERED ON HIS GREAT TRUST IN THE FULLEST PRIME OF MANHOOD EQUAL SEEMINGLY TO ANY POSSIBLE TOIL AND STRAIN
THAT IT REALLY DOES IN A GREAT MEASURE REST WITH OURSELVES WHETHER WE AMOUNT TO SOMETHING OR WORSE THAN NOTHING IN THE WORLD WE HAVE FOLLOWED THIS MAN FROM CHILDHOOD AND HAVE SEEN HIM OVERCOME
SEVERE DRUDGERY TEACHING AND ASSISTING THE POST MASTER BY THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE HE HAD SO FAR GAINED THE CONFIDENCE OF THE BAR
GRADUATING FROM THAT INSTITUTION HE BEGAN THE PRACTICE OF LAW AT THE BAR HE BECAME KNOWN AS A SOUND BUT NOT ESPECIALLY BRILLIANT PLEADER IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX HE WAS CHOSEN CHAIRMAN OF THE STATE COMMITTEE OF HIS PARTY
HE WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL ADVISER OF PRESIDENT MADISON IN THE MEASURES FOR THE RE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PUBLIC CREDIT OF THE COUNTRY
HE AT FIRST BECAME IDENTIFIED WITH THE WORK OF RAISING AND PLACING NEW FOUNDATIONS UNDER SEVERAL LARGE BUILDINGS OF THAT CITY
AND FOR AN EASY AND STRAIGHTFORWARD METHOD OF SPEECH HE HAD FEW SUPERIORS HIS LANGUAGE WAS EXCELLENT HIS MANNER THAT OF A MAN WHO HAD SOMETHING TO SAY AND WAS INTENT UPON SAYING IT HE WAS AT NO TIME A TRICKY ORATOR NOR DID HE AIM AT ROUSING THE FEELINGS
IN THAT YEAR HE SUCCEEDED TO THE PRESIDENCY HIMSELF BY AN ELECTORAL VOTE OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE OUT OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN AS THE CANDIDATE OF THE PARTY NOW GENERALLY KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC
SAMUEL J TILDEN IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN THERE WAS BORN AT NEW LEBANON NEW YORK
THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU ARE TO BE A MILTON A CROMWELL A WEBSTER OR A CLAY THAT YOU CANNOT HELP IT DO WHAT YOU WILL POSSIBLY THIS MAY BE SO IT MAY NOT BE THOUGHT PROPER FOR ME TO DISPUTE THEIR LORDSHIP
THESE HE FITTED UP WITH BUNKS AND WHILE THEY WERE NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH THE ELEGANT PALACES WHICH HE HAS SINCE CONSTRUCTED STILL ONE COULD LIE DOWN AND SLEEP ALL NIGHT WHICH WAS SO FAR IN ADVANCE OF ANYTHING THE PEOPLE HAD SEEN
HIS CABINET WAS COMPOSED OF SOME OF THE ABLEST MEN IN THE COUNTRY IN EITHER PARTY SOON AFTER HIS INAUGURATION PRESIDENT MONROE MADE A TOUR THROUGH THE EASTERN AND MIDDLE STATES
HE WAS AS TRULY A SACRIFICE TO HIS COUNTRY AS WAS THE BRAVE SOLDIER WHO LAID DOWN HIS LIFE IN THE PRISON PEN OR SANCTIFIED THE FIELD WITH HIS BLOOD FOR AN UNSWERVING AND PASSIONATE PATRIOTISM
MISTER TILDEN WAS ENGAGED IN A MOST ANIMATED CONVERSATION WITH A LEADING MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WITH WHOM HE ENTERTAINED PERSONAL CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONS THE CONVERSATION WAS ONE THAT BROUGHT ALL MISTER TILDEN'S LEARNING AND LOGICAL FORCES INTO PLAY IT WAS SEMI LITERARY
YOU TELL THEM THAT SAMUEL J TILDEN GAVE YOU ALL THE MONEY HE HAD EXCEPT ONE DOLLAR WHICH HE KEPT FOR HIMSELF IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WAS SATIRIZING AN APPEAL UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES
WHETHER MISTER TILDEN WOULD HAVE APPEARED AS THE REFORMER IF HE HAD NOT BEEN GROSSLY INSULTED BY TWEED THAT HE HAD NOT SO APPEARED UNTIL THE OCCASION REFERRED TO AND THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD HE BEGAN THE INVESTIGATION AND MOVEMENTS
AND BY AN APPREHENSION RARELY OR NEVER SURPASSED OF THE DETAILS TO BE WROUGHT OUT BY OTHER MEN MISTER TILDEN WAS CAPABLE OF COVERING HIS FACE WITH A MASK WHICH NONE COULD PENETRATE THE FOLLOWING SCENE OCCURRED UPON A TRAIN ON THE HUDSON RIVER ROAD
UNTIL HE HAD REACHED THE STATE OF MIND IN WHICH HE SAID TO THE PUBLIC WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT HE HAD GONE FURTHER HE HAD APPLIED IT TO THE LEADING MEN OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THE TIME CAME WHEN HE SAT IN HIS GORGEOUSLY FURNISHED APARTMENT IN ALBANY AS CHAIRMAN OF A CERTAIN COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE
HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND IN THE NATIONAL CONGRESS IN CONGRESS HE ROSE GRADUALLY TO THE FIRST RANK FOR INTEGRITY INDUSTRY AND PRACTICAL ABILITY
THAN AT THE TIME OF MISTER LINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION HIS PRESENCE OF MIND HIS PROMPT DECISION HIS UNFAILING FAITH AND COURAGE STRENGTHENED THOSE ABOUT HIM
SEVERAL FEET HIGH AN ENTERPRISE WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT HARDLY A BREAK DISCONTINUING NONE OF THE BUSINESS FIRMS WHO OCCUPIED THE BUILDING THEIR BUSINESS BEING CARRIED ON UNINTERRUPTED
NOR WERE HIS SERVICES LESS VALUABLE TO HIS COUNTRY WHEN AFTER THE SURRENDER OF THE CONFEDERATE ARMIES THE REBELLION WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND HE STOOD THE FEARLESS UNFLINCHING PATRIOT
AND WAS RECEIVED IN PARIS WITH ENTHUSIASTIC DEMONSTRATIONS OF RESPECT
AT THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT TAYLOR MISTER FILLMORE ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION IN SUCH CASES BECAME
CAYUGA COUNTY WAS THEN A WILDERNESS WITH FEW SETTLERS CONSEQUENTLY YOUNG FILLMORE'S EDUCATION WAS LIMITED TO INSTRUCTION IN READING WRITING SPELLING AND THE SIMPLEST BRANCHES OF ARITHMETIC
THE BUILDINGS ARE NOT MUSHROOM AFFAIRS BUT SUBSTANTIAL BRICK EDIFICES WHICH GIVE THIS PLACE AN APPEARANCE WHICH WILL COMPARE FAVORABLY WITH ANY CITY HE BUILT A FINE HOTEL AND ERECTED A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH
THE RESTORATION OF SLAVES AND OTHER SUBJECTS ALSO THE ADMISSION INTO THE UNION OF THE STATES OF MISSISSIPPI ILLINOIS AND MAINE
AND DIED IN WASHINGTON D C DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE WHEN FIFTEEN YEARS OLD HE BECAME A CLERK IN A BOOK STORE IN HIS NATIVE TOWN AND WITH MONEY THUS ACCUMULATED WAS ENABLED TO ATTEND KENYON COLLEGE
AND HIS DEVOTING HIMSELF TO THE OVERTHROW OF THAT GIGANTIC RING IT IS NOT OUR PURPOSE TO TREAT THE WHOLE SUBJECT YET THE MANNER OF THE BREAK WAS SO TRAGIC THAT IT SHOULD BE DETAILED WILLIAM M TWEED HAD GONE ON BUYING MEN AND LEGISLATURES AND ENRICHING HIMSELF
FACULTY TO SUCCESS AT ANY RATE NEVER WAIT FOR THE SLUMBERING GENIUS TO SHOW ITSELF IF YOU DO IT WILL NEVER AWAKE BUT SLUMBER ON THROUGH ENDLESS TIME AND LEAVE YOU
WHICH WIDENED THE BREACH BETWEEN HIM AND THE ADMINISTRATION
HIS FATHER BEING A PERSONAL AND POLITICAL FRIEND OF MISTER VAN BUREN AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CELEBRATED ALBANY REGENCY HIS HOME WAS MADE A KIND OF HEADQUARTERS FOR VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THAT COUNCIL
AND INSUFFICIENT YET WHEN IT WAS CONTEMPLATED BY SOME OF HIS FRIENDS AFTER HIS RETIREMENT TO TENDER HIM A HANDSOME GIFT OF MONEY HE RESOLUTELY AND UNHESITATINGLY FORBADE IT AND THE PROJECT HAD TO BE ABANDONED
AND INFUSED VIGOR INTO EVERY DEPARTMENT OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE
REVIEWED MILITARY COMPANIES CORRECTED PUBLIC ABUSES AND STUDIED THE CAPABILITIES OF THE COUNTRY WITH REFERENCE TO FUTURE HOSTILITIES ON THIS TOUR HE WORE THE UNDRESS UNIFORM OF A CONTINENTAL OFFICER IN EVERY POINT OF VIEW THIS JOURNEY WAS A SUCCESS
FOR A MAGNIFICENT COURAGE FOR RARE UNSELFISHNESS FOR TRANSCENDENT ABILITIES FOR IMMEASURABLE SERVICES TO HIS COUNTRY THE FIGURE OF THE GREATEST WAR MINISTER IN MODERN TIMES
AS AIDE DE CAMP TO LORD STERLING WITH THE RANK OF MAJOR HE SERVED IN THE CAMPAIGN OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF IN THE BATTLES OF BRANDYWINE GERMANTOWN AND MONMOUTH LEAVING THE ARMY HE RETURNED TO VIRGINIA
THAT BY THE INTERCESSION OF SEVERAL OF ITS LEADING MEMBERS HE WAS ADMITTED AS AN ATTORNEY BY THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF ERIE COUNTY
AS A STATE LEGISLATOR HE PARTICULARLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF BY HIS ADVOCACY OF THE ACT TO ABOLISH IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBT WHICH WAS DRAFTED BY HIM

AND IN THIS CASE THE CARD CONTAINS THE WORD DANCING BELOW THE DATE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT AND THE HOURS AT WHICH IT IS GIVEN FEW HOMES ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE FOR EVEN A SMALL DANCE AND SO A PARTY OF THIS SORT IS GENERALLY GIVEN AT A HOTEL
AND IT IS NOT A SUITABLE APPAREL FOR A DANCE OR ANY LARGE FORMAL EVENING AFFAIR THE CORRECT DRESS FOR A DAYTIME WEDDING IS A BLACK FROCK COAT WITH LIGHT TROUSERS LIGHT FANCY WAISTCOAT

HERE IT COMES STRAIGHT FOR US THIS TIME AND NO MISTAKE EXCLAIMED BOB AS THE WATER JETS AGAIN MARKED THE COURSE OF THE SHOT SCALDINGS OUT OF THE ROAD ALL OF US THAT'S GOT THIN SKULLS CONTINUED HE
AND BOB WENT ALOFT WITH THE DELIBERATION OF THE SEAMAN WHO IS IN NO PARTICULAR HURRY HAVING REACHED THE CROSS TREES HE STOOD UPON THEM WITH ONE HAND GRASPING THE PEAK HALLIARDS TO STEADY HIMSELF WHILST WITH THE OTHER HE SHADED HIS EYES
I DARE SAY THERE'S MORE OF THAT THAN WE'D FIND ON THE PLANK YOU'D GIVE US FOR A PARADE GROUND
GAZED IN SPEECHLESS HORROR AT THE DREADFUL CATASTROPHE A LOUD PIERCING SHRIEK RANG OUT CLEAR
TO THE SOUTHWARD OF STATEN AND I
HARDER THAN WOOD HE AND WINTER WERE BOTH WORKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF POWERFUL EXCITEMENT SO IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY HAD CLEARED AWAY THE SAND SUFFICIENTLY TO ENABLE THEM TO LAY HOLD OF AND DRAG FORTH
AS SOON AS BOB CAME ON SHORE HE OF COURSE JOINED US AND LENT HIS AID IN ADMIRING AND PRAISING OUR OWN HANDIWORK AS IS PRETTY GENERALLY THE CUSTOM WITH ALL MORTALS
ALMOST LIKE THE STEM OF A SHIP BESIDES BEIN STRONGER THAN A SQUARE SHAPED CONSARN
HERE ALSO I HAD THE HAPPINESS OF BEING UNITED TO THE DEAR GIRL WHO HAD IN SO MANY WAYS PROVED HERSELF WORTHY OF MY BEST AND STRONGEST LOVE AND AS OUR STORY
THE SIDES OF THE BOAT APPEARED TO BE VIOLENTLY WRENCHED APART AT THEIR JUNCTION WITH THE STEM THE GUN AND ITS CARRIAGE ROSE HEAVILY IN THE AIR ABOUT TEN FEET AND FELL WITH A TREMENDOUS SPLASH INTO THE SEA AND OARS AND MEN WERE FLUNG WILDLY ABOUT
GETTING A LITTLE SLANT OF WIND WHICH CARRIED US HANDSOMELY ACROSS THE USUALLY CALM BELT WHICH SO TRIES THE PATIENCE OF THE HOMEWARD BOUND SEAMAN AT THAT SPOT AND
I TRUST WE SHALL NOT FALL IN WITH HIM AGAIN THE PACIFIC IS A PRETTY BIG PLACE
AFTER A REMARKABLY FINE PASSAGE OF THIRTY NINE DAYS FROM TABLE BAY WE FOUND OURSELVES AT ANCHOR IN FUNCHAL ROADS
OTHER COMING DOWN THE COAST FOR IF WE FALLS IN WITH HER AG'IN
OR EVEN SMALLER TO VENTURE ROUND THE CAPE WELL SAID I PERHAPS IT WILL BE SAFEST BOB TO ASSUME FOR THE PRESENT THAT THIS BRIG IS THE ALBATROSS WHAT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IS YOUR ADVICE
A FOUR POUND RIFLED PIECE WHICH WAS SPECIALLY MADE TO MY ORDER BY AN EMINENT FIRM IT WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LITTLE WEAPON EXQUISITELY FINISHED WAS A BREECH LOADER AND THREW A SOLID SHOT ABOUT A MILE AND A SHELL NEARLY HALF AS FAR AGAIN
THIS WAS SOON UNCOVERED AND WE THEN SAW THAT IT WAS A PIECE OF LOOSE PLANK WHICH HE AND WINTER SUCCEEDED BETWEEN THEM IN RAISING AND UNDERNEATH IT LAY A DARK HOLLOW CAVITY TO WORK THEY BOTH WENT ONCE MORE
AS HE SPOKE THE SHIP WHICH WAS RUSHING FORWARD FURIOUSLY ON THE BACK OF A SEA SUDDENLY SHEERED WILDLY TO PORT UNTIL SHE LAY BROADSIDE TO THE CREST OF THE SEA OVERTOOK HER AND BREAKING ON BOARD HER
COLLECT MY SCATTERED FACULTIES IN AN INSTANT I HAD ALL FOUR OF THE BUOYS READY
WHEN I FIRST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SHE WAS HEADING DIRECTLY FOR US BUT AS WE WATCHED HER
OF HAVING ANY MORE TO DO WITH US PERHAPS IT MIGHTN'T BE QUITE ONPOSSIBLE TO DESTR'Y THE BOAT ALTOGETHER AND THEN THERE'S SEVEN OR EIGHT GOOD HANDS WIPED OFF THE CHAP'S BOOKS THIS HERE AIN'T LIKE A ORDINARY ENEMY YOU SEE LAD
SHAKING HER FEATHERS LIKE A DUCK I'M AFRAID
AND ALSO WITH THE COMPARATIVE DEGREES OF COMFORT BETWEEN THE DECKS AND THE CABIN BOB WAS THE FIRST TO MAKE A MUSTER IN THE MORNING
THE WATER LILY COULD SAIL ROUND AND ROUND THE ADA AND WE HAD TO TAKE IN OUR TOPSAIL
AND THE AIR WAS FULL OF SPINDRIFT AND SCUD WATER
SEIZED A TRUMPET TO HAIL US BUT WHETHER HE DID SO OR NOT OR IF HE DID WHAT HE SAID
THE WIND HAULED GRADUALLY MORE ROUND FROM THE NORTHWARD TOO AND BLEW WARM AND BALMY A MOST WELCOME CHANGE AFTER THE RAW AND CHILLY WEATHER WE HAD LATELY EXPERIENCED WE ONCE MORE CRACKED ON SAIL UPON THE LITTLE WATER LILY
HIS MALIGNITY WOULD DOUBTLESS PROMPT HIM TO DESTROY THE LITTLE LILY AND BY SUCH AN ACT ALL OUR PAST EFFORTS WOULD BE NULLIFIED AND OUR FUTURE SUCCESS RENDERED EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL WE MUST FIGHT ROBERT MY MAN NOW THAT WE CAN NO LONGER RUN
BUT THE FACT THAT SOME MISTAKE HAS OCCURRED SOMEWHERE WITH REGARD TO ITS POSITION HAS QUITE THROWN US OUT AND TO LOOK FOR IT AMONG THE NUMEROUS ISLANDS WHICH CONSTITUTE THIS ARCHIPELAGO
BUT YOU SEE THEY DID MEAN MISCHIEF AND PLENTY OF IT TOO
DREADFULLY TEDIOUS COOPED UP AS WE WERE IN OUR LOW CABIN
THE MORNING DAWNED FAIR AND SERENE THE SKY WAS WITHOUT A CLOUD EACH QUIVERING LEAF AND BLADE OF GRASS GLITTERED WITH DIAMOND LIKE DEW DROPS AND THE AIR WAS LADEN WITH THE PERFUME OF NUMBERLESS FLOWERS
SHE WAS FEARFULLY CLOSE BUT APPEARED TO BE AT THE MOMENT SHEERING AWAY FROM US SHE LOOKED LONG ENOUGH
A FEW RAYS SHOT UPWARD GLEAMING WILDLY AMONG THE FLYING SCUD AND THEN THE ORB OF DAY SANK INTO THE OCEAN SHOOTING ABROAD AS HE DID SO
SHE RETURNED STILL VERY NERVOUSLY TELL US THE STORY ALL OVER AGAIN PERHAPS SOME USEFUL IDEA MAY SUGGEST ITSELF TO ONE OR OTHER OF US IF IT IS ALL GONE CAREFULLY OVER ONCE MORE
AS I WAS NOT ONLY A MORE PRACTISED ARTILLERIST THAN HE BUT KNEW ALSO HOW TO HANDLE A BREECH LOADER AND I HAD THE KNACK SOMEHOW OF SHOOTING STRAIGHT I HAD IT LOADED AND WAS IN THE ACT OF LEVELLING IT WHEN BOB SAID
BUT IT'S GETTING TO BE RATHER TICKLISH WORK LAD AIN'T IT I WAS TOO BUSY WITH THE GUN TO REPLY JUST THEN AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT I FIRED ONCE MORE THIS TIME WE SAW THE SPLINTERS FLY FROM THE BOWS OF THE BOAT AND ONE OF THE OARSMEN SPRANG FROM HIS SEAT
FOR THE SAKE OF HUMAN NATURE TO SAY THAT THE INTERVIEW WAS EMINENTLY UNSATISFACTORY AND I LEFT THEIR HOUSE WITH A MENTAL RESOLVE THAT MY WIFE SHOULD NEVER WITH MY CONSENT ENTER THE DOORS OF SUCH UNNATURAL RELATIVES
FOR THE DOUBLE PURPOSE OF THROWING THE LIGHT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE OVER THE WATER AND ALSO TO INDICATE OUR WHEREABOUTS TO ANY STRONG SWIMMER WHO MIGHT BE STRUGGLING FOR HIS LIFE AMONG THE MOUNTAIN SURGES
I NOTICED THE NAME ON HIS STARN
I'D ALWAYS RATHER FIGHT THAN RUN AWAY HARRY LAD AT LEAST WHEN IT'S ANYTHING LIKE A FAIR MATCH SO LET'S ROUSE UP THE POP GUN AND HAVE A SHY AT EM
I COULD LAY MY HANDS ON AND IN ANOTHER THAT GLORIOUS BOB APPEARED WITH A COIL OF RATLINE ON HIS SHOULDER AND A LIGHTED BLUE LIGHT IN HIS HAND THE STOPS WERE CUT AND THE ENDS OF THE COIL CLEARED IN NO TIME AND THE TWO REMAINING BUOYS BENT ON
TWENTY TONS AND THE PRECIOUS METAL WAS ALSO SUBSTITUTED FOR THE LEAD BALLAST OF THE CUTTER
BUT HE EVIDENTLY HAD NO NOTION OF LETTING US HAVE OUR OWN WAY IN THIS MATTER WITHOUT A PRETTY VIGOROUS PROTEST ON HIS PART
HE HAD NO CHANCE WITH US IN A LIGHT AIR LIKE THE PRESENT AND I ENTERTAINED STRONG HOPES OF BEING ABLE TO SLIP PAST HIM UNSCATHED WHEN I FELT SANGUINE OF OUR ABILITY TO GET FAIRLY AWAY FROM HIM IN A CHASE DEAD TO WINDWARD
AND STOP AT THE POINT I HAVE NAMED THIS OF COURSE WE ALL CORDIALLY AGREED TO THOUGH I COULD SCARCELY HELP SMILING FURTIVELY AT THE IDEA OF A PICNIC
AND OUT OVER HER TAFFRAIL WE DESCENDED TO THE CABIN TO GET OUR SUPPERS FOR WHICH BY THIS TIME WE WERE QUITE READY SO EASY WAS THE MOTION OF THE LITTLE CRAFT
I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THIS AND FREQUENT OTHER EVIDENCES OF THE WARMTH AND STRENGTH OF ELLA'S ATTACHMENT TO ME AND OF THE CONFIDING FRANKNESS WITH WHICH SHE REVEALED IT

I AM HER AGENT TO HIM THEN I CAN STEAL THE DIAMONDS IN THEIR TRANSIT A WONDERFULLY CUNNING AND HARDY SCHEME AND MOST WONDERFUL WAS THE COOL KEEN PROMPTITUDE WITH WHICH IT WAS EXECUTED THE COUNTESS BEGAN TO HINT TO THE CARDINAL THAT SHE WAS FAST GETTING INTO THE QUEEN'S GOOD GRACES
AND HIS IMPORTANCE THERE WAS INDICATED TEN YEARS LATER BY THE RECEPTION GIVEN TO HIM AT VIENNA BY THE RUSSIAN COUNT ORLOFF WHO ACCOSTED HIM JOYOUSLY AS CARO PADRE DEAR FATHER AND GAVE HIM TWENTY THOUSAND GOLDEN VENETIAN SEQUINS
WHO ARE FOOLED BY SUCH WRETCHED BALDERDASH AS THIS THERE ARE SUCH HOWEVER AND A GREAT MANY OF THEM I DO NOT IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE MANY OF THESE ADDLEPATES AMONG MY READERS BUT THERE IS NO HARM IN GIVING ONCE MORE A VERY PLAIN AND EASY DIRECTION
THE GROTESQUE APPEARANCE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THE MUSIC SOON DREW TOGETHER AN ADMIRING CROWD THEN THE GREAT CHARLATAN STOOD UPON HIS FEET HIS MANNER WAS CALM DIGNIFIED
THIS THE LADY THOUGHT RATHER CURIOUS BUT SHE WAS GLAD THE THING WAS DISPOSED OF AND SAID NO MORE TIME PASSED ON AGAIN IN THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE BOEHMER TOOK THE TROUBLE
IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT THERE WERE IN FULL BLAST IN NEW YORK AND BROOKLYN SIXTEEN WITCHES AND TWO WIZARDS ONE OF THESE WIZARDS WAS A BLACK MAN A VERY PROPER STYLE OF PERSON TO DEAL WITH THE BLACK ART WITCH MEANS
HAVING BARELY BEEN ABLE TO SEND A MESSAGE IN GERMAN TO HIS HOTEL TO A TRUSTY SECRETARY WHO INSTANTLY DESTROYED ALL THE PAPERS RELATING TO THE AFFAIR JEANNE WAS ALSO IMPRISONED
CURSED JOE AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN HE WAS A SECOND TIME EXPELLED FROM THE CONVENT OF CARTEGIRONE BELONGING TO THE ORDER OF BENFRATELLI THE GOOD FATHERS HAVING IN VAIN ENDEAVORED TO TRAIN HIM UP
I HAVE MUCH WANTED TO VISIT AMERICA BUT I CANNOT SPEAK ENGLISH SO I MUST REMAIN IN MY DEAR BELLE FRANCE I REMARKED THAT I HAD OFTEN SEEN HIM IN PUBLIC AND BOUGHT HIS PENCILS AHA YOU NEVER SAW BETTER PENCILS
HOW A SHINGLE STUMPED THE SPIRITS
AND PROPHECY IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES THE FORTUNES OF THE COUNT SAINT GERMAIN ROSE SO RAPIDLY IN FRANCE THAT IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY
I IN BEING THE RECIPIENT OF SUCH UNTOLD BENEFITS THROUGH HIS VALUABLE DISCOVERY AT LAST THE DOCTOR CHANCED TO SAY THAT HE WONDERED HOW I HAPPENED TO GET HIS PILLS IN NATCHEZ
THE PORTRAITS OF CAGLIOSTRO OF WHICH A NUMBER ARE EXTANT ARE PICTURES OF A STRONG BUILT BULL NECKED FAT GROSS MAN WITH A SNUB NOSE A VULGAR FACE A LOOK OF SENSUALITY AND LOW HYPOCRITICAL CUNNING
SAID TO BE THE MOST WEALTHY IN EUROPE AND A CARDINAL HE HAD BEEN AMBASSADOR AT VIENNA A LITTLE AFTER MARIE ANTOINETTE WAS MARRIED TO THE DAUPHIN AND WHILE THERE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF HIS OFFICIAL STATION TO DO A TREMENDOUS QUANTITY OF SMUGGLING
ALL WHO DARED TO ARGUE AGAINST THE CURRENT OF POPULAR AND JUDICIAL DELUSION WERE INSTANTLY REFUTED VERY EFFECTIVELY BY BEING ATTACKED FOR WITCHCRAFT THEMSELVES AND ONCE ACCUSED THERE WAS LITTLE HOPE OF ESCAPE
SUPERIOR TO CAGLIOSTRO EVEN IN ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND SECOND TO HIM IN NOTORIETY ONLY WAS THAT HUMAN NONDESCRIPT THE SO CALLED COUNT DE SAINT GERMAIN WHOM FREDRICK THE GREAT CALLED A MAN NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE OUT
IT WAS ALMOST THE HEAD OF AN ANGEL SHINING IN THE GLORY OF THE SPHERES BUT A BETTER THOUGHT PREVAILED AND QUICKLY REMOVING IT SHE WITH A WAVE OF HER BEAUTIFUL HAND DECLINED THE GIFT
BUT IT IS ONE GRAND SECRET
THAT HE BROKE TO PIECES WITH A HAMMER A SUPERB DIAMOND OF HIS OWN MANUFACTURE THE EXACT COUNTERPART OF ANOTHER OF SIMILAR ORIGIN
THAT SECURED THEIR FORTUNATE POSSESSOR UNIMPEDED AND IMMEDIATE ADMISSION TO HEAVEN OF COURSE TICKETS SO PRECIOUS COULD NOT BE GIVEN AWAY FOR NOTHING AND THE SEAL TRADE IN THIS NEW FORM PROVED VERY LUCRATIVE
AND THUS COVERED HIS FACE FROM THE GAZE OF THE ANXIOUS CROWD THIS BIT OF COQUETRY PRODUCED THE DESIRED EFFECT IN WHETTING THE APPETITE OF THE MULTITUDE WHO WERE IMPATIENTLY WAITING TO HEAR HIM SPEAK
ABOUT SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE THIS GREAT FOOL FELL IN WITH AN EQUALLY GREAT KNAVE
YOU WOULD NOT PATRONIZE TRUE UNPRETENDING HONEST MERIT BUT YOU ARE ATTRACTED BY MY GLITTERING CASQUE MY SWEEPING CREST MY WAVING PLUMES
CREATED COUNT DE SAINT REMI THE FAMILY HAD RUN DOWN AND BECOME POOR AND RASCALLY ONE OF JEANNE'S IMMEDIATE ANCESTORS HAVING PRACTICED COUNTERFEITING FOR A LIVING SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN PROTECTED
NAMELY IF THE MANUFACTURERS OF NEW ENGLAND WANTED TO GIVE MONEY TO THE SANITARY COMMISSION THEY WOULD GIVE MONEY IF GOODS THEY WOULD GIVE GOODS THEY CERTAINLY WOULD NOT PUT THEIR GIFTS THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL ROUNDABOUT USELESS NONSENSE OF A LOTTERY
ONE OF THE SAFEST SWINDLES EVER CONTRIVED THE FIRST DOCUMENT WHICH I TAKE FROM MY PILE IS THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A FELLOW WHO OPERATES LOTTERY WISE HIS SCHEME APPEALS AT ONCE TO BENEVOLENCE AND TO GREEDINESS HE SAYS
ARE AT THE SERVICE OF HIS LIEGE LADY HIS PURSE IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED WITH INFINITE SHYNESS AND CIRCUMSPECTION THE COUNTESS GRADUALLY HALF UNWILLINGLY LETS HIM FIND OUT THAT IT IS THE DIAMOND NECKLACE
SWINDLING JEANNE CARRIED IT OFF AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH AN ENTRY MADE BY VILLETTE DE RETAUX IN THE MARGIN THUS BON BON APPROUVE
WHICH READ SOMEWHAT AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR HUSBAND I AM VERY GLAD TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS YOU THROUGH THIS CHANNEL KEEP ON INVESTIGATING AND YOU WILL SOON BE CONVINCED OF THE GREAT FACT OF SPIRIT INTERCOURSE I AM HAPPY IN MY SPIRIT HOME
HE REFUSED HE DID HE SAID HE HAD AN INCLINATION FOR THE GIRL HIMSELF THAT IN HIS LIFE BEFORE HE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THE REPULSE OF A SLAVE HE MEANT TO POSSESS HER AND HE WOULD
BUT YOU SAID THEN THAT I MUST NOT LOOK SO LIKE A BEGGAR AS THAT WOULD FRIGHTEN THE EMPLOYER TO WHOM YOU WOULD TAKE ME I ANSWERED I HAVE NOT THE MEANS OF DRESSING OTHERWISE YOU SAID TO ME COME TO THE TEMPLE
SEYTON WAS CHARGED BY THE GRAND DUKE WITH AN ERRAND TO VISIT SEVERAL BREEDING STUDS IN AUSTRIA THIS MISSION WHICH HE COULD NOT REFUSE WOULD ONLY DETAIN HIM A FORTNIGHT HE SET OUT WITH MUCH REGRET
WHO WAS EMPLOYED IN THE INFIRMARY ATTACHED TO HIS DWELLING A VERY REMARKABLE DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE COMBINED WITH A CONSTANT AND DEEP COMMISERATION FOR THE SICK POOR TO WHOM HE GAVE WITH THE UTMOST ATTENTION AND CARE THE MEDICINE ORDERED BY THE DOCTORS
AND TO SEE HIM WALK WITH BOTH HIS HANDS IN THE POCKETS OF HIS LONG AND WARM COAT OF DARK BROADCLOTH HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR ONE OF THE MOST INOFFENSIVE CITIZENS IN THE WORLD FAITH MY FINE FELLOW
AN APPEARANCE AT ONCE CONSTRAINED AND REPULSIVE WHICH IT IS PAINFUL TO LOOK AT FOR ALAS AND ALACKADAY IT IS AT THE BACK OF A CHAMBERLAIN THAT THE SYMBOL OF HIS OFFICE GLITTERS AND AS MONSEIGNEUR AVERS
TO LEND HIMSELF TO THE MARRIAGE
HAVING TILL THEN SLUMBERED WAS SUDDENLY AWAKENED AND DEVELOPED ITSELF WITH FEARFUL ENERGY YOU KNOW THE REST AND ALL THE SCANDAL OF THE ADVENTURES THAT FOLLOWED AFTER HAVING BEEN TWO YEARS A WIFE DAVID
FOR HE MUST AFTER THAT HAVE REQUIRED THE MAN'S SERVICES PRECISELY SO FOR THAT VERY DAY THE VERY FURY INTO WHICH HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF JOINED TO THE DRUNKENNESS IN WHICH THE BRUTE INDULGED EVERY EVENING
WAS TOO REFINED TO ALLOW HIM TO BOAST OF HIS HAPPINESS BEFORE THE TIME WHEN HE SHOULD MARRY CECILY WHICH WAS TO BE WHEN SHE HAD TURNED HER SIXTEENTH YEAR MISTER WILLIS IGNORANT OF THEIR LOVE HAD THROWN HIS HANDKERCHIEF RIGHT ROYALLY AT THE PRETTY METISSE
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT TWAS THE PAY OF AN ADJUTANT SUB OFFICER I REPLIED
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MISTER WILLIS SITUATED ON THE BORDERS OF THE SEA WAS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY LEAGUES FROM THE NEAREST TOWN AND THE MEDICAL MEN OF THE DISTRICT IGNORANT AS THEY WERE GAVE THEMSELVES
WELL WHAT FOLLOWED IN MY LIFE I NEVER SAW SO DISTRESSING A SPECTACLE PALE WAN MEAGRE HALF NAKED AND COVERED WITH WOUNDS DAVID AND THE UNHAPPY GIRL CHAINED BY THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY
OUR CONDUCT WAS CONTRARY TO THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY I KNOW BUT IF YOU HAD SEEN IN WHAT A HORRIBLE STATE WE FOUND THIS UNFORTUNATE AND HALF DEAD COUPLE IF YOU HAD HEARD THE SACRILEGIOUS DEFIANCE
OF THE GRAND DUKE AT A CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN DIET THE PROPHECY OF THE SCOTCH SOOTHSAYER WAS FULFILLED SARAH WEDDED THE HEIR TO A THRONE WITHOUT QUENCHING THE FIRE OF HIS LOVE
AND DANGERS APPEARED IMPOSSIBLE TO POLIDORI AND HE FRANKLY TOLD SEYTON THE REASONS WHY THE GRAND DUKE WOULD NEVER SUBMIT TO SUCH A UNION SEYTON AGREED IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REASONS BUT PROPOSED
WHO WITH A MERRY FACE AND ACTIVE HANDS WAS VERY BUSY IN COMPLETING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE SHOP
SARAH PROMISED TO KEEP SEYTON FULLY INFORMED DAY BY DAY OF THE PROGRESS OF EVENTS SO IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF THEM AND THAT THEY MIGHT CORRESPOND MORE SURELY AND SECRETLY THEY AGREED UPON A CIPHER
AS TO THE ERRAND ON WHICH HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS HAS EMPLOYED EACH OF THEM AS AN OSTENSIBLE MOTIVE FOR GETTING RID OF THEM IN A QUIET WAY SENDING ONE TO AVIGNON AND THE OTHER TO STRASBOURG I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT SOME DAY
I WHO NEVER EARNED BUT TWO AND THAT ALL AT ONCE
HE ADDED WITH PERFECT SINCERITY HE AND HIS SISTER WOULD INSTANTLY LEAVE GEROLSTEIN SARAH PARTICIPATED IN THE PRINCE'S AFFECTION BUT PREFERRING DEATH TO DISHONOUR SHE COULD ONLY BE THE WIFE OF HIS HIGHNESS
AND IN A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR HIS SISTER SHE WAS CHAGRINED YET SATISFIED AT THE DEPARTURE OF HER BROTHER FOR SHE WOULD LOSE HIS ADVICE BUT THEN HE WOULD BE SAFE FROM THE GRAND DUKE'S ANGER
BUT SOON RESTORED THROUGH THE CAREFUL ATTENTIONS AND EFFICACIOUS REMEDIES OF DAVID OUT OF THIRTY NEGROES DANGEROUSLY AFFECTED BY THIS FATAL DISEASE ONLY TWO PERISHED MISTER WILLIS
MANY OF THE LADIES PRESENT LOOKED AT HER WITH AN ASTONISHED AIR AND WHISPERED TO THEIR NEIGHBOURS THE GRAND DUCHESS JUDITH IN SPITE OF HER NINETY YEARS HAD A QUICK EAR AND A SHARP EYE AND THIS LITTLE WHISPERING DID NOT ESCAPE HER
FONDER THAN EVER OF HER NO DOUBT SHE ADDED HE WILL BE VERY ANGRY GREATLY ENRAGED AT FIRST BUT HE LOVES HIS SON SO TENDERLY SO BLINDLY AND HAD FOR HER SARAH SO STRONG
SEYTON GAVE THE PRINCE EIGHT DAYS TO DECIDE HIS SISTER COULD NOT LONGER ENDURE THE CRUEL ANGUISH OF UNCERTAINTY AND IF SHE MUST RENOUNCE RODOLPH'S LOVE SHE MUST ACT UP TO HER PAINFUL RESOLVE AS PROMPTLY AS MIGHT BE
THESE UNFORTUNATE CREATURES EVINCED THEIR INDIGNATION OR RATHER GRIEF MOST POWERFULLY WHEN THEY SAW DAVID LACERATED BY THE WHIP MISTER WILLIS DEEPLY EXASPERATED AFFECTED TO DISCOVER IN THIS MANIFESTATION THE APPEARANCE OF REVOLT
THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE CONSTRAINT
FOR A BUTCHER IN THAT TOWN AND WHICH WERE EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THE CHURCH ONE OF THOSE IDLERS MORE INQUISITIVE THAN HIS COMPANIONS WENT AND ASKED THE BUTCHER BOY
WHY I SHALL BE VERY SORRY FOR IT THAT'S ALL I MEANT TO SAY MY GOOD FELLOW THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO RECOMPENSE YOUR SERVICES BUT THAT HE SHOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM
THE COLONIST SAID TO HIM WITH CRUEL IRONY WELL DOCTOR HOW GOES IT YOU WHO ARE SO CLEVER WHY DON'T YOU CURE YOURSELF THE BLACK REPLIED BY A NOBLE WORD AND A DIGNIFIED GESTURE HE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND SLOWLY
WHEN THEY HAD SEEN ALL BUT THE UP STAIRS MURPHY SAID YOU MUST OWN THAT MY FRIEND IS A LUCKY FELLOW THIS HOUSE AND PROPERTY ARE HIS WITHOUT COUNTING A THOUSAND CROWNS IN HAND TO CARRY ON HIS BUSINESS WITH
I FOUND YOU THERE IN A CAB AND HERE WE ARE WELL DO YOU FIND ANYTHING TO REGRET IN ALL THIS
RECEIVED THE DEGREE OF SURGEON AND PHYSICIAN WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED SUCCESS AND THEN RETURNED TO AMERICA TO PLACE HIMSELF AND HIS SKILL UNDER THE DIRECTION OF HIS MASTER
WHO LIVED HOWEVER VERY LONG IN A WORD THIS CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE BROTHER AND SISTER CLEARLY DEVELOPED THEIR UNBOUNDED SELFISHNESS THEIR AMBITIOUS CALCULATIONS THEIR IMPATIENCE
TO THE EXTREME GRATIFICATION OF THE BLACK DOCTOR WHOSE FELLOWS REGARDED HIM AS A DIVINITY AMONGST THEM FOR HE HAD WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY IT IS TRUE OBTAINED FROM THEIR MASTER SOME FEW INDULGENCES AND WAS HOPING TO PROCURE STILL MORE
TELL ME IN WHAT COURT IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU FIND A MORE PERFECT MODEL OF A CHAMBERLAIN
AND OBSERVED SO MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION TOWARDS EACH OTHER THAT THEY ELUDED ALL DETECTION AN EVENT IMPATIENTLY DESIRED BY SARAH SOON TURNED THIS CALM INTO A TEMPEST SHE WAS ABOUT TO BECOME A MOTHER
THE CHAISE HOUSE THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE THE LOFTS AND THE OUT BUILDINGS OF THE HOUSE WHICH WERE ALL IN EXCELLENT ORDER AND KEPT WITH A CLEANLINESS AND CARE WHICH BESPOKE REGULARITY AND EASY CIRCUMSTANCES
WHAT THE DEVIL ONE DOES NOT OPEN A DOOR WITH ONE'S BACK AT ALL EVENTS BARON THE COURIER THE COURIER SAID MURPHY POINTING TO THE CLOCK
THE MANAGEMENT OF ALL HE FOUND A PRIEST WITNESSES AND THE UNION ALL THE FORMALITIES OF WHICH WERE CAREFULLY SCRUTINISED AND VERIFIED BY SEYTON WAS SECRETLY CELEBRATED DURING A TEMPORARY ABSENCE
A FEW MINUTES LATER WE WERE AGAIN ON BOARD THE BRIG WHICH INSTANTLY SET SAIL IT APPEARS TO ME MY DEAR MURPHY
MUCH GRATIFIED BY THE SERVICES WHICH DAVID HAD SO AUSPICIOUSLY RENDERED
FROM THIS PERIOD DAVID HAS BEEN ATTACHED TO THE SUITE OF MONSEIGNEUR AS A MEDICAL MAN AND IS MOST DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO HIM DAVID MARRIED CECILY OF COURSE ON ARRIVING IN EUROPE THIS MARRIAGE
WELL WELL DON'T LET US SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT ONLY I HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE TO FIND YOU OUT YOU DO NOT NOW GO TO THE OGRESS'S NO WHY NOT
FOR THAT PAVEMENT REVERBERATING RATHER SADLY HAS BEEN SULLIED AND BLACKENED BY CHARRED HUMAN FLESH IT IS KNOWN THAT ON THE DAY OF THE CONFLAGRATION THE CHURCH WAS FULL OF WOUNDED GERMANS
HOW DEARLY HER MAJESTY HAD ALREADY LOVED THOSE MARVELS NOW RUINED AND ALL THE PAST OF HER ADOPTED COUNTRY WHICH SURVIVED THERE IN THE OLD STONE TRACERY OF FLANDERS
STILL ERECT AND MAJESTIC BUT WHICH THE LEAST TOUCH WOULD TURN INTO ASHES THE GROUND IS STREWN WITH ITS PRECIOUS FRAGMENTS IT HAS BEEN HASTILY ENCLOSED WITH A HOARDING OF WHITE WOOD AND WITHIN ITS BOUNDS LIES IN LITTLE HEAPS
ALL WERE UNITED RESOLUTE DISCIPLINED SOBERED AND DREAMING OF HAVING A FLAG ON THEIR RETURN THEY WERE SENT IN HASTE TO GHENT TO COVER THE RETREAT OF THE BELGIAN ARMY BUT ON THE WAY THEY WERE STOPPED AT DIXMUDE
THE ESSENTIAL POINT
SOME ARTISANS SOME DAY LABOURERS AND THERE ARE EVEN SOME WHO WEAR THEIR CAPS AT TOO RAKISH AN ANGLE AND WHOSE LANGUAGE SMACKS OF THE RING INTO WHOSE PAST IT IS BETTER NOT TO PRY TOO CURIOUSLY
WHEN AT LAST THE BELGIAN NON COMMISSIONED OFFICER WHO GUIDED MY CHAUFFEUR ALONG THESE UNFAMILIAR ROADS ANNOUNCES THAT WE HAVE ARRIVED HER MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH OF THE BELGIANS HAS DEIGNED TO GRANT ME AN AUDIENCE AT HALF PAST SIX
THERE WERE RAIN SNOW FLOODS CHURNING UP BLACK MUD IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TRENCHES BLOOD SPLASHING UP EVERYWHERE ROOFS FALLING IN CRUSHING WOUNDED IN CONFUSED HEAPS OR DEAD BODIES IN ALL STAGES OF DECOMPOSITION
THERE HAS BEEN SOME CHANGE IN THEM SHE SAYS IN HESITATING WORDS THEY USED NOT TO BE LIKE THIS THE CROWN PRINCE
AND GENERALS AND MILLIONS OF GERMANS HAVE BEEN FOUND READY TO UNITE AFTER A CALCULATED PREPARATION OF NEARLY HALF A CENTURY IN COMMITTING THIS SAME PRELIMINARY CRIME THE FORERUNNER OF SO MANY OTHERS AND BY WAY OF PRELUDE
TO GAZE UPON HER OUR LEGENDARY AND WONDERFUL BASILICA OF FRANCE TO BID HER A LAST FAREWELL BEFORE SHE SHOULD CRUMBLE AWAY TO HER INEVITABLE DOWNFALL I HAD ORDERED A DETOUR OF TWO HOURS IN MY SERVICE MOTOR CAR
AND THEY WHO HOLD THE TRENCH GONE TO EARTH SCARCELY FOR A MOMENT KNOW THAT THEY MAY EXPECT AT ANY MINUTE THE DAILY SHOWER OF SHELLS THEN HEADS RASH ENOUGH TO SHOW THEMSELVES ABOVE THE PARAPET WILL BE SHOT AWAY BREASTS SHATTERED
THEY SANG THIS MORNING THESE IMPROVISED CHORISTERS WITH A SOLEMN TRANSPORT THEN AFTER MASS IN SPITE OF THE ICY RAIN AND THE MUDDY ROADS THE CROWDS THAT ISSUED FROM EACH CHURCH IN PROCESSION BETOOK THEMSELVES TO THE CEMETERIES
BEFORE ALL THESE DEEDS OF HEROISM HAVE FALLEN INTO OBLIVION
STREWN WITH RUINS AND THE DEAD SOON HOWEVER PERHAPS BECAUSE A LITTLE BOND OF CONFIDENCE HAS ESTABLISHED ITSELF BETWEEN US
WET WITH RAIN SEEMED TO BE WRAPPED COMPLETELY IN A KIND OF SHINING FLEECE WE HAD ALSO PASSED THROUGH A FOREST KEEPING OUR EYES OPEN AND OUR WEAPONS READY IN CASE OF A MEETING
DISPOSSESSED TO DAY OF HIS ALL AND BANISHED TO A HAMLET WHAT TRIBUTE OF ADMIRATION AND HOMAGE CAN WE OFFER HIM WORTHY OF HIS ACCEPTANCE AND SUFFICIENTLY ENDURING UPON TABLETS OF FLAWLESS MARBLE LET US CARVE HIS NAME IN DEEP LETTERS
NO THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE IT MUST BE LEFT TO THE GRACE OF GOD ON HIS RETURN HIS EMINENCE GRACIOUSLY PROVIDES ME WITH A GUIDE WHO HAS THE KEYS OF THE HOARDING AND AT LAST I PENETRATE INTO THE RUINS OF THE BASILICA
WERE TROUBLED AT THE PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY THE QUEEN OF THE BELGIANS WHO HAD SPRUNG FROM THEIR OWN RACE AND INDIGNANT WHEN THE MONSTER WHO LEADS THIS WITCHES SABBATH EVEN TRIED TO SINGLE OUT HER CHILDREN
ONE NEVER GROWS TIRED OF BENDING THE HEAD BACKWARDS TO GAZE AT THEM THOSE SACRED VAULTS HASTENING TO DESTRUCTION AND THEN HIGH UP TOO QUITE HIGH UP THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE NAVE IS
VERY INDISTINCTLY I SEE A DESERT LIKE LANDSCAPE OF DUNES AND SANDS ALMOST WHITE STRETCHING OUT INTO INFINITY WOULD YOU NOT IMAGINE IT A SITE IN THE SAHARA SAYS MY GUIDE
WHERE THE BARBARIANS WITH PINK SKINS LIKE BOILED PIG WERE ESTABLISHED IN TEN TIMES THEIR NUMBER AND WHERE AT ALL COSTS A STAND WAS TO BE MADE TO PREVENT THE ABOMINABLE ONRUSH FROM SPREADING FARTHER THEY HAD BEEN TOLD
OH MAY SHE BE BLEST REVERENCED AND GLORIFIED
WITH TRANSLUCENT DRAPERIES AND LUMINOUS AUREOLES THERE AGAIN GERMAN SCRAP IRON HAS CRASHED THROUGH IN GREAT SENSELESS VOLLEYS SHATTERING EVERYTHING
BY A LONG COURSE OF TRAINING NOW THERE HAD NOT BEEN TIME TO ACCUSTOM THESE MEN TO THE PRACTICE AND WHEN IT CAME TO AN ATTACK THEY SET OUT INDEED AS ORDERED DRAGGING THEMSELVES ALONG ON ALL FOURS BUT PROMPTLY CARRIED AWAY BY THEIR ZEAL
THEIR INDIGNATION WILL INSPIRE THEM TILL THEIR LATEST BREATH WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN SAID TWO YOUNG BRETON PEASANTS TO ME WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN WITH YOUR OWN EYES WHAT THESE BRUTES DO IN THE VILLAGES THEY PASS THROUGH
WHEN SHE CONTEMPLATES THE DRAMA OF HER DESTINY BUT A CONVERSATION WITH A QUEEN IS NOT DIRECTED BY ONE'S OWN FANCY AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE AUDIENCE HER MAJESTY TOUCHES UPON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS LIGHTLY AND GRACEFULLY
WITH PRAYER BOOKS IN THEIR HANDS IN HONOUR OF SUNDAY AT A STREET CROSSING THERE IS A GATHERING OF PEOPLE IN FRONT OF A HOUSE WHOSE WALLS BEAR SIGNS OF RECENT DAMAGE THE REASON BEING THAT A SHELL HAS JUST FALLEN THERE
NEVERTHELESS I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO STAY A FEW MINUTES LONGER AND TO WITNESS THE PERFORMANCE AGAIN IN THEIR COMPANY AH TO BE SURE A KIND OF WHIRRING IN THE AIR LIKE THE FLIGHT OF PARTRIDGES
OF OUR EXCELLENT YOUNG FRIENDS NEVERTHELESS BY DINT OF MAKING UP THEIR MINDS TO IT
AT THEIR OWN GAME A MILE FARTHER ON IS THE FIRST LINE IT IS FULL OF SOLDIERS FOR THIS IS THE TRENCH THAT MUST WITHSTAND THE SHOCK OF THE BARBARIANS ONSET DAY AND NIGHT IT IS ALWAYS READY TO BRISTLE WITH RIFLES
BUT NOT ALL OF US YET HAVE WOOLLEN UNDERCLOTHING FOR THE WINTER AND WE SHALL NEED IT SOON WHEN YOU GO BACK TO PARIS COLONEL PERHAPS YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS TO BRING THIS TO THE NOTICE OF GOVERNMENT AND OF ALL THE LADIES TOO
WE HAVE HAD TO ESTABLISH TRENCHES SUCH AS THESE IN DOUBLE AND TREBLE LINES CROSSING OUR DEAR COUNTRY FROM EAST TO WEST ALONG AN UNBROKEN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF MILES LIKE A KIND OF GREAT WALL OF CHINA
ALL THIS THEY KNOW FOR THEY HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY SMILE A SERIOUS DIGNIFIED SMILE THEY HAVE BEEN NEARLY A WEEK IN THIS TRENCH WAITING TO BE RELIEVED AND THEY MAKE NO COMPLAINTS
TO CONTINUE THERE BECAME TRULY A TASK BEYOND
WHEN YOUR ARAB CAVALRY CAME HERE THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE IT IS TRUE FOR EVEN IN AFRICA THE SANDS TURN PALE IN THE DARKNESS BUT THIS IS A SAHARA TRANSPORTED UNDER THE GLOOMY SKY OF A NORTHERN NIGHT
WITH THE ADVENT OF NIGHT A BITTER COLD WAS DESCENDING UPON THE FOREST WHICH WRAPPED THEM ROUND FARTHER ON I CAME TO A VILLAGE THE HEADQUARTERS OF A GENERAL OFFICER IN COMMAND OF AN ARMY CORPS
ARE A KIND OF CAVE OR MOLEHILL HALF COVERED WITH BRANCHES AND LEAVES I HAD SEEN THE SAME KIND OF ARCHITECTURE ONCE UPON A TIME ON EASTER ISLAND AND THE SIGHT OF THESE DWELLINGS OF MEN IN THIS SCENERY OF PRIMEVAL FOREST
EVEN AT THE COST OF A SEEMINGLY INEVITABLE DOOM OF ANNIHILATION WHAT STARRY CROWNS CAN HISTORY AWARD WORTHY OF THAT BELGIAN NATION AND OF THEIR KING WHO DID NOT FEAR TO BID THEM SET THEMSELVES THERE AS A BARRIER KING ALBERT OF BELGIUM
ON ENTERING THE FIRST HOUSE TO WHICH THE AIDE DE CAMP CONDUCTS ME
THAT THEY SEEM TO BE COVERED WITH ONE AND THE SAME RICHLY DECORATED CARPET DURING THESE DAYS OF FESTIVAL THE REST OF THE CEMETERY IS ALSO VERY FULL OF FLOWERS BUT IT LOOKS DULL AND COLOURLESS COMPARED WITH THAT CORNER SACRED TO OUR SOLDIERS
SILENT ANNA STOOD AND LOOKED AROUND AND AS SHE STOOD SHE HEARD THE TALK OF THE PEOPLE ABOUT HER
AND SOME YOUNG GIRLS HAVE PASSED BY THAT I HAVE SAID TO MY WIFE I BET YOU A BOB THOSE ARE ENGLISH YES OF COURSE SHE HAS REPLIED YOU CAN SEE THAT BY THEIR DRESS I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DRESS I HAVE SAID I JUDGE BY THE WALK
FOR I SAW DISTINCTLY MISS VENVILLE A VERY NICE GIRL OF MY ACQUAINTANCE COMING UP THE PATH
STEPPY NEED I GO TO SCHOOL ANY MORE
I THREW MYSELF BACK IN THE BED AND AS I DID SO A MASS OF CHARRED WOOD ON THE HEARTH FELL DOWN AND SENT UP A FLASH OF I FANCY SPARKS THAT GAVE OUT A GLARE IN THE DARKNESS AND BY THAT RED AS BLOOD I SAW A FACE NEAR ME
AND ANNA WITH A SCREAM OF DESPAIR FLUNG HERSELF FORWARD WITH HER FACE ON THE PAVEMENT AND HER HANDS EXTENDED TWO YEARS AGO DURING THE FIRST WEEK IN JUNE AN ENGLISH TRAVELLER ARRIVED AT SIEBENSTEIN
ALL TO A DEAD HUSH ANNA STAGGERED TO HER FEET AND TURNED TO GO BACK TO HER COTTAGE AND AS SHE OPENED THE DOOR HEARD THE CUCKOO CALL TWO
BUT A PLACE HAD BEEN KEPT FOR ME NEXT LADY LYNTON BESIDES MY HOSTS THERE WERE THEIR TWO DAUGHTERS COLONEL LYNTON A BROTHER OF SIR FRANCIS THE CHAPLAIN AND SOME OTHERS WHOM I DO NOT REMEMBER DISTINCTLY
I RECKON IT'S THE OLD LADY BE DOWN REPLIED HER HUSBAND AND THROWING OPEN THE BEDROOM DOOR HE SAID
BUT HE DISAPPOINTED EXPECTATIONS AND LIVED HIS MOTHER DIED SOON AFTER AND HIS FATHER MARRIED AGAIN AND HIS FATHER AND STEPMOTHER LOVED HIM DOUBTLESS BUT LOVE IS MANIFESTED IN MANY WAYS AND THE LAMBOLES SHOWED THEIRS IN A ROUGH WAY
BY SLAPS AND BLOWS AND KICKS THE FATHER WAS ASHAMED OF HIM BECAUSE HE WAS A WEAKLING AND THE STEPMOTHER BECAUSE HE WAS UGLY AND WAS NOT HER OWN CHILD HE WAS A MEAGRE LITTLE FELLOW WITH A LONG NECK AND A WHITE FACE AND SUNKEN CHEEKS
PEERED TIMOROUSLY INTO THE APARTMENT THAT SERVED MANY PURPOSES KITCHEN SITTING ROOM AND DINING PLACE THE MOONLIGHT POURED IN THROUGH THE BROAD LOW WINDOW BY IT THEY SAW A FIGURE
AND HE CRIED HIMSELF TO SLEEP THE FIRST NIGHT AND HE CRIED ALL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SENT AROUND WITH MEAT ON HIS SHOULDER NOW ON HIS JOURNEY THROUGH THE STREETS HE HAD TO PASS THE WINDOW OF A TOY SHOP IN THE WINDOW WERE DOLLS AND HORSES AND LITTLE CARTS
AND YOU MUST TEACH THEM AS YOU FEED THE POLAR BEARS WITH THE END OF A STICK ONE DAY MISS AMORY SEEING HOW THIN AND HOLLOW EYED THE CHILD WAS AND HEARING HIM COUGH BROUGHT HIM OUT A CUP OF HOT COFFEE AND SOME BREAD
LOOK WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE HE HAS BUILT FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE HE IS THERE IN SUMMER AND IT IS FURNISHED MAGNIFICENTLY BUT HE WILL NOT SUFFER THE OLD HUMBLE ARLER COTTAGE HERE TO BE MEDDLED WITH
AND WAS UNABLE TO ANSWER AN ORDINARY QUESTION WHAT THE LESSON WAS ABOUT THE SCHOOL CHILDREN TORMENTED HIM THE MONITOR SCOLDED AND THE MASTER BEAT THEN LITTLE JOE GANDER TOOK TO ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM SCHOOL
MY ARCHAEOLOGICAL FANCIES PASSED I HAD NO VISITS FROM ANTHROPOLOGISTS THE BONES AND SKULL WERE NEVER SHOWN TO EXPERTS BUT REMAINED PACKED IN A CHEST IN THAT LUMBER ROOM I CONFESS I OUGHT TO HAVE BURIED THEM HAVING NO MORE SCIENTIFIC USE FOR THEM
BUT WITH A TOWER THAT HAS DEFIED THE WINDS AND THE LASHING RAINS BECAUSE WHOLLY DEVOID OF SCULPTURED DETAIL WHICH WOULD HAVE AFFORDED THE BLASTS SOMETHING TO LAY HOLD OF AND EAT AWAY IN ZENNOR PARISH IS ONE OF THE FINEST CROMLECHS IN CORNWALL
IN WHICH I HAVE SOME INTEREST THERE'S NO KNOWING SAID THE SQUIRE NO KNOWING BUT THAT WITH WHOLESOME FOOD CLEANLINESS AND KINDNESS HIS FEEBLE MIND MAY BE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT TWO AND TWO MAKE FOUR WHICH I LEARN HE HAS NOT YET MASTERED
AN INQUIRY WAS SET ON FOOT AND AMONG OTHERS MY GRANDFATHER'S KEEPERS WERE EXAMINED BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES IT WAS REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS THAT THE UNDER KEEPER IN QUESTION WAS ABSENT AT THE TIME OF THE INQUIRY
HE'D HAVE A NEAT STONE ERECTED ABOVE THE GRAVE WITH WORK ON IT AT TWOPENCE A LETTER THE NAME AND THE DATE OF DEPARTURE OF AUNT JOANNA
THE SUN HAD SET IN THE VALLEY BUT THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS WERE STILL IN THE GLORY OF ITS RAYS SURROUNDING THE PLACE AS A GOLDEN CROWN HE LIGHTED A CIGAR AND LOOKING INTO THE CEMETERY OBSERVED THERE AN OLD WOMAN
THERE WAS NO SLEEP FOR THEM THAT NIGHT IN THE GLOOM WHEN THE MOON WAS CONCEALED IN THE GLARE WHEN IT SHONE FORTH IT WAS THE SAME
WHEN YOU COME TO THINK OF IT IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT THE LIGHT OF SO DAZZLING A NATURE SHOULD SHINE THROUGH THE CRANNIES OF THE DOOR AND THAT NONE SHOULD ISSUE AS FAR AS I COULD SEE FROM THE WINDOWS AT THE TIME I DID NOT GIVE THIS A THOUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS OTHERWISE TAKEN UP
AND MISS AMORY HAD TAKEN LESSONS FROM THE BEST MASTERS IN TOWN SHE PLAYED VASTLY BETTER THAN POOR ROGER GALE AND SHE PLAYED TO AN ACCOMPANIMENT SOMETIMES WHILST JOE WAS SWEEPING HE HEARD THE MUSIC
BUT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE AND WENT ON HER WAY HE WAS STRUCK WITH HER FACE HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN ONE SO FULL OF BOUNDLESS SORROW ALMOST OF DESPAIR
THE SQUIRE'S COACHMAN TOLD ME AND I MENTIONED YOU
LYNTON CAME BACK ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND MAKING AN EXCUSE TO SHOW ME ON A MAP IN THE HALL THE POINT TO WHICH WE HAD RIDDEN SAID AS SOON AS WE WERE ALONE WITH A LOOK OF CONSIDERABLE ANNOYANCE
NEAR THIS MONUMENT OF A HOAR AND INDEED UNKNOWN ANTIQUITY LIVED AN OLD WOMAN BY HERSELF IN A SMALL COTTAGE OF ONE STORY IN HEIGHT
IT WILL EASILY BE IMAGINED HOW PLEASANT IT WAS TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTER MY ARRIVAL IN LONDON TO RECEIVE A LETTER FROM LYNTON SAYING HE HAD JUST SEEN IN THE PAPERS THAT I HAD ARRIVED AND BEGGING ME TO COME DOWN AT ONCE TO BYFIELD HIS PLACE IN YORKSHIRE
SAID JABEZ AY RESPONDED ELIZABETH AND WHAT A SIGHT O PEOPLE CAME HERE THIS HERE BURYIN OF AUNT JOANNA HAVE SET US UP TREMENDOUS IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE NEIGHBOURS I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO ELSE WOULD HA DONE IT FOR A POOR OLD CREETUR AS IS NO RELATION AY
ROSE AND WENT INTO THE OUTER SHOP TO SERVE A CUSTOMER WITH HALF A POUND OF TEA THAT DONE SHE WAS BACK AGAIN AND THE SCRUBBING WAS RENEWED AGAIN A TINKLE AND AGAIN SHE STOOD UP AND WENT INTO THE SHOP TO A CHILD WHO DESIRED TO BUY A PENNYWORTH OF LEMON DROPS
AND THEN FAINTLY AS FROM A FAR DISTANCE SOUNDED IN HER EAR THE CALL OF THE CUCKOO THREE THE MAGNIFICENT NEW CHURCH HAD SHRIVELLED UP TO THE ORIGINAL MEAN LITTLE EDIFICE ANNA HAD KNOWN ALL HER LIFE THE SQUARE WAS DESERTED
ALL FADED AWAY AND A VOICE SAID IN HER SOUL HE IS NO SON OF THINE ANNA ARLER HE IS NOT BECAUSE THOU WOULDEST NOT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GOD HAD SO PURPOSED
HE DON'T LOOK LIKE A HUMAN CHILD HE DON'T THINK AND FEEL LIKE A CHRISTIAN THE SHOVELFULS OF DUNG HE MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT TO COVER OUR GARDEN IF HE HAD ONLY GIVEN HIS HEART TO IT I'VE HEARD OF CHANGELINGS SAID MISSUS LAMBOLE
HOW CAN YOU GET ABOUT AN THERE'S NO KNOWIN BUT YOU MIGHT BE TOOK BAD IN THE NIGHT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SOME LITTLE LASS WI YOU TO MIND YOU I DON'T WANT NOBODY THANK THE LORD
THEN QUAKING WITH FEAR THEY RETREATED TO THE CHURCH PORCH AND JABEZ UNCORKING THE BOTTLE FIRST TOOK A LONG PULL HIMSELF AND THEN PRESENTED IT TO HIS WIFE
AND HE TUMBLED OVER EVERY OBSTACLE BECAUSE HE NEVER LOOKED WHERE HE WAS GOING ALWAYS LOOKED TO SOMETHING BEYOND THE HORIZON BECAUSE OF HIS WALK AND HIS LONG NECK AND STARING EYES AND BIG STOMACH THE VILLAGE CHILDREN CALLED HIM GANDER JOE OR JOE GANDER
BUT HE CARRIED HOME WITH HIM THE HAUNTING RECOLLECTIONS OF THAT BEAUTIFUL LITTLE RED FIDDLE WITH ITS FINE BLACK KEYS THE BOW HE REMEMBERED WAS STRUNG WITH WHITE HORSEHAIR JOE
AGAINST HER EXPRESS ORDERS IT WAS AT THIS DANCE THAT SHE HAD MET THE WHEELWRIGHT AND THIS MEETING AND THE TREATMENT THE GIRL HAD MET WITH FROM HER AUNT FOR HAVING GONE TO IT HAD LED TO THE MARRIAGE
BOARD SCHOOLS HAVE REDUCED US TO THAT OF LEAD AT MARKSLEIGH THE VILLAGERS BELIEVE IN IT AND RECENTLY THEIR FAITH HAS RECEIVED CORROBORATION HOW SO I ASKED LAST YEAR IN A FIT OF BRAVADO
THE BOOK OF THE LIFE OF POLLY FINCH OR RATHER OF GWENDOLINE'S SOUL IN POLLY FINCH'S BODY IT WAS BUT ONE PAGE THAT I SAW AND THE FIGURES IN IT WERE MOVING THE GIRL WAS STRUGGLING UNDER THE BURDEN OF A HEAVY BABY BROTHER
NO ONE IN THE ROOM AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR EXCEPT THE SKELETON THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN THE CHALK PIT WHEN YOU WERE HERE MANY YEARS AGO I CONFESS I HAD NOT PAID MUCH HEED TO IT
HAVE YOU GOT A FIDDLE YES I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE IT AND HEAR YOU PLAY NEXT DAY WAS SUNDAY LITTLE JOE FORGOT ABOUT THE DAY AND FORGOT THAT MISS AMORY WOULD PROBABLY BE IN CHURCH IN THE MORNING
SHE PLACED ALL SIX ON THE SHEET AND WITH A LEAN FINGER COUNTED THEM SHE TURNED HER FACE TOWARDS THOSE WHO WERE WATCHING HER PROCEEDINGS BUT IT WAS IN SHADOW
THERE IS A VAGUE MURMUR IN THE MANIFEST DREAM SOMETHING IS LOST OR SUPPRESSED I HOPE YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THE INEVITABILITY OF THE CONCLUSION THAT IT IS THE SHOCKING CHARACTER OF THESE PLACES IN THE DREAM THAT WAS THE MOTIVE FOR THEIR SUPPRESSION
NOR IS THERE ANY REASON FOR CONSIDERING THE MEMORY FUNCTION AS A PARTICULARLY HIGH OR DIFFICULT PSYCHIC PERFORMANCE IN FACT THE CONTRARY IS TRUE AND YOU CAN FIND A GOOD MEMORY IN PERSONS WHO STAND VERY LOW INTELLECTUALLY
WITH ALL ITS PECULIARITIES ITS EGOISM ITS INCESTUOUS LOVE CHOICE ET CETERA CONTINUES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE DREAM IN THE UNCONSCIOUS
CAN BE RESOLVED INTO ITS COMPONENTS THE WHOLE ATTACK MAY BE REPRESENTED BY A SINGLE INTENSIVELY DEVELOPED SYMPTOM SUCH AS A TREMBLING DIZZINESS PALPITATION OF THE HEART OR TIGHTENING OF BREATH
NEITHER FAR NOR NEAR CAN WE DISCOVER A DANGER OR A CAUSE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXAGGERATED TO SUCH SIGNIFICANCE THROUGH THESE SPONTANEOUS ATTACKS WE LEARN THAT THE COMPLEX WHICH WE CALL THE CONDITION OF ANXIETY
THE MOTIVES ARE RIVALRY FOR THE LOVE OF THE PARENTS ARTICLES OWNED IN COMMON THE ROOM ITSELF THE HOSTILE IMPULSES ARE CALLED FORTH BY OLDER AS WELL AS YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS
EXECUTE THE SEXUAL ACT IN A SHORTENED OR MUTILATED FORM UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES LIBIDINOUS EXCITEMENT DISAPPEARS AND ANXIETY TAKES ITS PLACE BOTH IN THE FORM OF EXPECTANT FEAR AND
AND THE ERROR IS THE COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO THE DREAM FITS INTO THE SAME SCHEME THE TENDENCY INTERFERED WITH IN THIS CASE CAN BE NO OTHER THAN THAT OF SLEEP
HAVE BELONGED TO THE UNCONSCIOUS BUT SOMETIMES THEY BOB UP OUT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS SPONTANEOUSLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN DREAMS IT IS APPARENT THAT THE DREAM LIFE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO THESE LATENT
BUT THESE THINGS DO EXIST THEY HAVE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AS INDICATIONS OF INNATE CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS CAUSES AND FURTHERANCES OF LATER DEVELOPMENTS THEY GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO CHILDHOOD SEX LIFE AND THEREBY INTO THE SEX LIFE OF MAN
IN ALL ITS CLINICAL AND ETIOLOGICAL RELATIONS TWO QUESTIONS ARISE CAN WE RELATE NEUROTIC FEAR IN WHICH DANGER PLAYS SO SMALL A PART OR NONE AT ALL TO REAL FEAR
IN THIS CONNECTION IT APPEARS TO ME FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE SYMBOLIC RELATIONS WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL HAS NEVER LEARNED
UNDER THE PRESSURE OF EDUCATION HE LAYS NO SPECIAL STRESS ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEXES RATHER ACCREDITS TO BOTH THE SAME GENITAL FORMATION
OR POSSIBLY EVEN ATTACK UNDER SUCH A PROCEEDING FEAR HAS ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS WOULD BE CONSUMMATED JUST AS WELL AND BETTER WITHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEAR YOU KNOW THAT IF FEAR IS TOO STRONG
AND FOR THAT REASON HE SOFTENED THEM BY WAY OF PREVENTION MODIFIED THEM SLIGHTLY OR CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH INNUENDO AND ALLUSION TO WHAT REALLY WANTED TO FLOW FROM HIS PEN THUS THE SHEET IT IS TRUE HAS NO BLANK SPACES
AND SAYING THAT THESE PERSONS HAVE EXHIBITED A TENDENCY TO ANXIETY FROM THE OUTSET AND THEREFORE PRACTICE RESERVE IN SEXUAL MATTERS THE BEHAVIOR OF WOMEN WHOSE SEXUAL CONDUCT IS PASSIVE
BUT IT WOULD BE STRANGE INDEED IF THE CHILD BROUGHT FORTH COMPLETE PSYCHIC PRODUCTS IN SLEEP WHILE THE ADULT IN THE SAME CONDITION CONTENTS HIMSELF WITH SPASMODIC REACTIONS INDEED
IN THE WITHDRAWAL OF INTEREST FROM THE ENTIRE EXTERNAL WORLD THE EGO WHICH HAS BEEN FREED OF ALL ETHICAL RESTRAINTS FEELS ITSELF IN ACCORD WITH ALL THE DEMANDS OF THE SEXUAL STRIVING WITH THOSE DEMANDS WHICH HAVE LONG SINCE BEEN CONDEMNED BY OUR AESTHETIC REARING
A COLLISION FOR INSTANCE MAY OCCUR OR A SHIP SINK WHEN AS A RULE WE MUST DROWN YET WE DO NOT THINK OF THESE DANGERS AND FREE FROM FEAR WE TRAVEL ON TRAIN AND BOAT WE CANNOT DENY THAT IF A BRIDGE SHOULD COLLAPSE AT THE MOMENT WE ARE CROSSING IT
IN THIS INSTANCE ALSO THE DREAM IS THE RESULT OF COMPROMISE WE SLEEP AND YET WE EXPERIENCE THE REMOVAL OF A WISH WE GRATIFY THE WISH BUT AT THE SAME TIME CONTINUE TO SLEEP
A RELATION TO DANGER AND SO THOUGH THEY ARE EXAGGERATED IN INTENSITY THEY DO NOT SEEM INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US MOST OF US FOR INSTANCE EXPERIENCE A FEELING OF REPULSION IN THE PRESENCE OF A SNAKE
POLYMORPHUS PERVERSE AND IF HE MAKES BUT SLIGHT USE OF ALL THESE IMPULSES IT IS ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE OF THEIR LESSER INTENSITY AS COMPARED TO LATER LIFE AND ON THE OTHER HAND
THAT OF A GAP IN THE MEMORY IS FAR MORE FREQUENT I BELIEVE WE HAVE NOT LAID ENOUGH STRESS ON THIS FACT THE CHILD IS ABLE TO SPEAK WELL AT THE AGE OF TWO IT SOON SHOWS THAT IT CAN BECOME ADJUSTED TO THE MOST COMPLICATED PSYCHIC SITUATIONS
WE MUST NOW BRING INTO THE DREAM WORK AS THE DREAM CENSOR THE RESISTANCE TO INTERPRETATION IS NOTHING BUT THE OBJECTIVATION OF THE DREAM CENSOR THE LATTER PROVES TO US THAT THE FORCE OF THE CENSOR HAS NOT SPENT ITSELF IN CAUSING THE DREAM DISTORTION
WHILE FEARLESSNESS AND BOLD DARING ARISE FROM FREE GRATIFICATION OF SEXUAL DESIRES HOWEVER MUCH THESE RELATIONS ARE ALTERED BY VARIOUS INFLUENCES OF CIVILIZATION FOR THE AVERAGE HUMAN BEING IT IS TRUE
DREAM DISTORTION IS THEREFORE NOT INHERENT IN THE DREAM I MAY ASSUME THAT THIS RELIEVES YOU OF A GREAT BURDEN BUT UPON CLOSER CONSIDERATION WE SHALL HAVE TO ADMIT OF A TINY BIT OF DISTORTION
AND OUR AGORAPHOBIST IS ACTUALLY RELIEVED OF HIS FEAR IF SOME ONE GOES WITH HIM ACROSS THE SQUARE OR STREET THE TWO FORMS OF FEAR THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED FREE FLOATING FEAR AND THE FEAR WHICH IS BOUND UP WITH PHOBIAS
AS WE WOULD BE IF WE UNDERSTOOD IT JUST THINK OF THE SCANDALIZED OPINION OF THE FINE OLD LADY ABOUT HER UNINTERPRETED DREAM OF SERVICES OF LOVE THE PROBLEM IS NOT YET SOLVED
WE DEEM IT QUITE A MATTER OF COURSE THAT THE SAVAGE FEARS A CANNON OR AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN WHILE THE WHITE MAN
THE EMOTIONAL CONDITION HAS A STRUCTURE SIMILAR TO THAT OF AN HYSTERICAL ATTACK IT IS THE UPSHOT OF A REMINISCENCE THE HYSTERIC ATTACK THEN IS COMPARABLE TO A NEWLY FORMED INDIVIDUAL EMOTION
I AVOID ENTERING UPON A DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER OUR LANGUAGE MEANS THE SAME OR DISTINCT THINGS BY THE WORDS ANXIETY FEAR OR FRIGHT I THINK THAT ANXIETY IS USED IN CONNECTION WITH A CONDITION REGARDLESS OF ANY OBJECTIVE
AND TO DISCUSS IT WITH YOU AT SOME LENGTH FEAR ITSELF NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION EVERYONE HAS AT SOME TIME OR OTHER KNOWN THIS SENSATION OR MORE PRECISELY THIS EFFECT
IS CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH CERTAIN PROCESSES IN SEXUAL LIFE LET US SAY WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF LIBIDO UTILIZATION THE SIMPLEST AND MOST INSTRUCTIVE CASE OF THIS KIND RESULTS WHEN PERSONS EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO FRUSTRATED EXCITATION
FOR WE KNOW THAT IT IS THESE STIMULI THAT COMMONLY CAUSE THE DISTURBED SLEEP OF ADULTS BY PREVENTING THEM FROM PRODUCING THE IDEAL CONDITION OF SLEEP THE WITHDRAWAL OF INTEREST FROM THE WORLD THE DREAMER DOES NOT WISH TO INTERRUPT HIS LIFE
YOU WILL REPROACH ME WITH JUDGING THE WAR ONE SIDEDLY YOU WILL SAY THAT IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT FORTH ALL THAT IS MOST BEAUTIFUL AND NOBLE IN MANKIND ITS HEROIC COURAGE ITS SELF SACRIFICE ITS SOCIAL FEELING CERTAINLY
ALTHOUGH THEY PROMISE HIM THAT HE WILL GET SOME OF THEM HIMSELF THE NEXT MORNING HE RELATES AS HIS DREAM HERMANN EAT ALL CHERRIES B
WHERE THE TOASTMASTER WAS OUTRAGED AND ASSURED US THAT NEITHER THEN NOR EVER BEFORE HAD HE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF DISRESPECTFUL IMPULSE TOWARD HIS CHIEF THIS IS REPEATED WITH EVERY INTERPRETATION OF A MARKEDLY DISTORTED DREAM AND FOR THAT REASON ATTAINS A SIGNIFICANCE FOR OUR CONCEPTION
IF YOU REJECT THE UNPLEASANT YOU ARE REPEATING THE MECHANISM OF DREAM CONSTRUCTION INSTEAD OF UNDERSTANDING AND MASTERING IT
WE ARE NOW PREPARED TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE ARE PROCESSES AND TENDENCIES IN THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF WHICH ONE KNOWS NOTHING AT ALL HAS KNOWN NOTHING FOR SOME TIME MIGHT IN FACT PERHAPS NEVER HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING
BUT IT REAWAKENS THE PECULIARITIES OF OUR PRIMITIVE PSYCHIC LIFE THE ANCIENT PREDOMINANCE OF THE EGO THE EARLIEST IMPULSES OF OUR SEXUAL LIFE EVEN OUR OLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
IF THE MILLIONS OF FOLLOWERS DID NOT SHARE IN THE GUILT DO YOU DARE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BREAK A LANCE FOR THE ABSENCE OF EVIL FROM THE PSYCHIC CONSTITUTION OF MANKIND
THE STAFF DOCTOR I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY SEVERAL OFFICERS AMONG THEM ONE WHO HAD PAID COURT TO HER IN HER YOUTH
AND BEING OF A READY WIT
NOW WHO IS THERE THAT DOES NOT PERCEIVE THAT THERE ARE NOT ONLY SEVEN DAYS BUT RATHER EIGHT FROM THE FOURTEENTH TO THE ONE AND TWENTIETH IF THE FOURTEENTH BE ALSO RECKONED IN THE NUMBER
THIS ANSWER BEING BROUGHT TO EDWIN BY HIS MESSENGERS HE PROMISED THAT HE WOULD IN NO MANNER ACT IN OPPOSITION TO THE CHRISTIAN FAITH WHICH THE MAIDEN PROFESSED BUT WOULD GIVE LEAVE TO HER AND ALL THAT WENT WITH HER MEN AND WOMEN BISHOPS AND CLERGY TO FOLLOW THEIR FAITH AND WORSHIP AFTER THE CUSTOM OF THE CHRISTIANS
AND THE BRITONS PRESERVED THE FAITH WHICH THEY HAD RECEIVED UNCORRUPTED AND ENTIRE IN PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY UNTIL THE TIME OF THE EMPEROR DIOCLETIAN
BUT ABOVE THE PAVEMENT FOR THE HONOUR DUE TO HIM THEY MADE KNOWN THEIR RESOLVE TO BISHOP EADBERT AND HE CONSENTED TO IT AND BADE THEM TO BE MINDFUL TO DO IT ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BURIAL
BY TWENTY EIGHT FAMOUS CITIES BESIDES INNUMERABLE FORTS WHICH WERE ALL STRONGLY SECURED WITH WALLS TOWERS GATES AND BARS AND BECAUSE IT LIES ALMOST UNDER THE NORTH POLE THE NIGHTS ARE LIGHT IN SUMMER
AND WHICH YOU STILL CONTINUE TO GIVE TO THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH TO WHOM HE ANSWERED IF YOU WILL BE WASHED IN THAT FONT OF SALVATION IN WHICH YOUR FATHER WAS WASHED YOU MAY ALSO PARTAKE OF THE HOLY BREAD OF WHICH HE PARTOOK
STARTING FROM THE SOUTH THEY HAD OCCUPIED THE GREATER PART OF THE ISLAND WHEN IT HAPPENED THAT THE NATION OF THE PICTS
SO THAT LIKE THE SAMARITANS OF OLD HE SEEMED AT THE SAME TIME TO SERVE CHRIST AND THE GODS WHOM HE SERVED BEFORE
BUT BECAUSE PETER WAS SO SHORN IN MEMORY OF THE PASSION OF OUR LORD THEREFORE WE ALSO WHO DESIRE TO BE SAVED BY THE SAME PASSION DO WITH HIM BEAR THE SIGN OF THE SAME PASSION ON THE TOP OF OUR HEAD
OF WHICH THE SCARLET DYE IS MADE A MOST BEAUTIFUL RED WHICH NEVER FADES WITH THE HEAT OF THE SUN OR EXPOSURE TO RAIN BUT THE OLDER IT IS THE MORE BEAUTIFUL IT BECOMES IT HAS BOTH SALT AND HOT SPRINGS
THEY TOOK SOME PART OF THE HAIR TO GIVE AS RELICS TO FRIENDS WHO ASKED FOR THEM OR TO SHOW IN TESTIMONY OF THE MIRACLE ONE OF THE PRIESTS OF THE MONASTERY NAMED THRUIDRED WHO IS NOW ABBOT THERE HAD A SMALL PART OF THESE RELICS BY HIM AT THAT TIME
THE FIFTH WAS EDWIN KING OF THE NORTHUMBRIAN NATION THAT IS OF THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE DISTRICT TO THE NORTH OF THE RIVER HUMBER HIS POWER WAS GREATER
EMPEROR OF THE GAULS EUTROPIUS WRITES THAT CONSTANTINE BEING CREATED EMPEROR IN BRITAIN SUCCEEDED HIS FATHER IN THE SOVEREIGNTY IN HIS TIME THE ARIAN HERESY BROKE OUT
IT SHALL BE THE FIRST MONTH OF THE YEAR TO YOU SPEAK YE UNTO ALL THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL SAYING IN THE TENTH DAY OF THIS MONTH THEY SHALL TAKE TO THEM EVERY MAN A LAMB ACCORDING TO THE HOUSE OF THEIR FATHERS
HE PERCEIVED THAT THE WAY OF VIRTUE DELIVERED BY THE SCOTS WAS IN NO WISE PERFECT AND HE RESOLVED TO GO TO ROME TO SEE WHAT ECCLESIASTICAL OR MONASTIC RITES WERE IN USE AT THE APOSTOLIC SEE
AND THEREFORE FINDING HIM TO BE A CATHOLIC
THEREFORE FIRMLY CONFIDING IN THE LONG SUFFERING OF THE DIVINE CLEMENCY WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF YOUR PREACHING THERE WILL ENSUE MOST FULL SALVATION NOT ONLY OF THE NATIONS SUBJECT TO HIM BUT ALSO OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS
FELL AT HIS FEET PRAYING EARNESTLY THAT HE MIGHT RATHER BE ACCOUNTED WORTHY TO SUFFER WITH THE MARTYR WHOM HE WAS ORDERED TO EXECUTE OR IF POSSIBLE INSTEAD OF HIM WHILST HE WAS THUS CHANGED FROM A PERSECUTOR
THIS MAN HAVING ONE DAY WASHED IN THE SEA THE COVERINGS OR BLANKETS WHICH HE USED IN THE GUEST CHAMBER WAS RETURNING HOME WHEN ON THE WAY HE WAS SEIZED WITH A SUDDEN INFIRMITY
AND HAVING CONFESSED THEIR SINS THEY WIPED THEM OUT BY FRUITS WORTHY OF REPENTANCE AS HE BADE THEM HE WAS WONT CHIEFLY TO RESORT TO THOSE PLACES AND PREACH IN THOSE VILLAGES WHICH WERE SITUATED AFAR OFF AMID STEEP AND WILD MOUNTAINS
DELIVERING ALL THAT PROVINCE ACCORDING TO THE INNER SIGNIFICATION OF HIS NAME FROM LONG INIQUITY AND UNHAPPINESS AND BRINGING IT TO THE FAITH AND WORKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE GIFTS OF EVERLASTING HAPPINESS
AND LED BEFORE THE JUDGE IT HAPPENED THAT THE JUDGE AT THE TIME WHEN ALBAN WAS CARRIED BEFORE HIM WAS STANDING AT THE ALTAR AND OFFERING SACRIFICE TO DEVILS WHEN HE SAW ALBAN BEING MUCH ENRAGED THAT HE SHOULD THUS
WHO DURING THE TIME OF DANGER HAD HIDDEN THEMSELVES IN WOODS AND DESERTS AND SECRET CAVES CAME FORTH AND REBUILT THE CHURCHES WHICH HAD BEEN LEVELLED TO THE GROUND FOUNDED ERECTED AND FINISHED THE CATHEDRALS
ETHELBERT KING OF KENT HAVING MOST GLORIOUSLY GOVERNED HIS TEMPORAL KINGDOM FIFTY SIX YEARS ENTERED INTO THE ETERNAL JOYS OF THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
FOR THE TERMS OF YOUR KINGSHIP YOU KNOW TO BE THIS THAT TAUGHT BY ORTHODOX PREACHING THE KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR KING AND CREATOR YOU BELIEVE AND WORSHIP GOD AND AS FAR AS MAN IS ABLE PAY HIM THE SINCERE DEVOTION OF YOUR MIND
BECAUSE ALSO WE DO THEN ONLY TRULY CELEBRATE HIS SOLEMN FESTIVAL IF WE ENDEAVOUR WITH HIM TO KEEP THE PASSOVER
BUT A RAMPART WITH WHICH CAMPS ARE FORTIFIED TO REPEL THE ASSAULTS OF ENEMIES IS MADE OF SODS CUT OUT OF THE EARTH AND RAISED HIGH ABOVE THE GROUND LIKE A WALL HAVING IN FRONT OF IT THE TRENCH WHENCE THE SODS WERE TAKEN
WHEN AFTER EXPELLING THE ENEMY HE HAD WITH THE HELP OF THE BRETHREN BUILT HIMSELF A NARROW DWELLING WITH A MOUND ABOUT IT AND THE NECESSARY CELLS IN IT TO WIT AN ORATORY AND A COMMON LIVING ROOM
WAS NOT PERMITTED TO REJOICE OVER HIS DEAD BODY FOR HIS EYES DROPPED UPON THE GROUND AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE BLESSED MARTYR'S HEAD FELL AT THE SAME TIME WAS ALSO BEHEADED THE SOLDIER WHO BEFORE THROUGH THE DIVINE ADMONITION
AND IT IS NOTED FOR THE HUNTING OF STAGS AND ROE DEER
THROUGH THE DISPENSATION OF THE LORD'S MERCY AS MAY BE BELIEVED TO THE END THAT IF HE WAS IN ANY WISE INFERIOR IN MERIT TO THE BLESSED CUTHBERT THAT WHICH WAS LACKING MIGHT BE SUPPLIED BY THE CHASTENING PAIN OF A LONG SICKNESS
WILFRID THE BELOVED OF GOD BISHOP OF THE CITY OF YORK APPEALING TO THE APOSTOLIC SEE AND BEING BY THAT AUTHORITY ACQUITTED OF EVERY THING WHETHER SPECIFIED AGAINST HIM OR NOT
FROM THE NAME OF THEIR COMMANDER THEY ARE TO THIS DAY CALLED DALREUDINI
LIKE A PLAIN ON ITS SIDES A PLACE ALTOGETHER WORTHY FROM OF OLD
TO THE END THAT HE WHO HAS BEEN PLEASED TO DELIVER YOU FROM ALL ERRORS AND BRING YOU TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS NAME IN THIS PRESENT WORLD MAY LIKEWISE PREPARE A PLACE FOR YOU IN THE HEAVENLY COUNTRY
FACING THOUGH AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE THE COASTS OF GERMANY FRANCE AND SPAIN WHICH FORM THE GREATEST PART OF EUROPE IT EXTENDS EIGHT HUNDRED MILES IN LENGTH TOWARDS THE NORTH
NERO SUCCEEDING CLAUDIUS IN THE EMPIRE
AND ENCOMPASSED ON ALL SIDES BY THE SHIFTING WAVES OF THE SEA THERE HE ALWAYS USED TO SPEND THE TIME OF LENT AND WAS WONT TO PASS THE FORTY DAYS BEFORE THE NATIVITY OF OUR LORD IN GREAT DEVOTION WITH ABSTINENCE AND PRAYER AND TEARS
THE SAME AGILBERT BEING THEN BISHOP OF THE CITY OF PARIS ELEVEN OTHER BISHOPS MET AT THE CONSECRATION OF THE NEW BISHOP AND THAT FUNCTION WAS MOST HONOURABLY PERFORMED
THE LAST HAVING BECOME COMMON TO ALL BY THE STUDY OF THE SCRIPTURES BUT AT FIRST THIS ISLAND HAD NO OTHER INHABITANTS BUT THE BRITONS FROM WHOM IT DERIVED ITS NAME AND WHO
HE ACQUIRED FROM THE TEACHING OF THAT SAME MASTER
FROM ANCIENT TIMES THE BISHOP WAS WONT TO RESIDE THERE WITH HIS CLERGY AND THE ABBOT WITH HIS MONKS
NOR DID HE REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT RELIGION HIMSELF IF BEING EXAMINED BY WISE MEN IT SHOULD BE FOUND MORE HOLY AND MORE WORTHY OF GOD
KEEP BEFORE YOUR EYES THAT LOVE OF HIS DOCTRINE WHICH HE ZEALOUSLY BESTOWED FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR SOULS THAT HIS PRAYERS MAY EXALT YOUR KINGDOM AND PEOPLE
FORTIFIED WITH SEVERAL TOWERS FROM SEA TO SEA AND THERE AT YORK HE FELL SICK AFTERWARDS AND DIED LEAVING TWO SONS
AND OTHER CANONICAL RITES ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE ROMAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH HE GAVE THE SAME TO HIM WHOM HE FOUND TO BE INSTRUCTED IN BETTER DISCIPLINE AND BETTER CUSTOMS
WHOM WILFRID AS HIS CLERK ATTENDED TO THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS TO BE BEHEADED BEING VERY DESIROUS THOUGH THE BISHOP STRONGLY OPPOSED IT TO DIE WITH HIM BUT THE EXECUTIONERS UNDERSTANDING THAT HE WAS A STRANGER AND OF THE ENGLISH NATION SPARED HIM AND WOULD NOT PUT HIM TO DEATH WITH HIS BISHOP
BOTH BY THE AUTHORITY OF A MASTER AND THE EXAMPLE OF HIS OWN BEHAVIOUR NOR DID HE BESTOW HIS TEACHING AND HIS EXAMPLE IN THE MONASTIC LIFE ON HIS MONASTERY ALONE
THERE ALSO HIS VENERABLE PREDECESSOR CUTHBERT HAD FOR SOME TIME SERVED AS THE SOLDIER OF THE LORD IN SOLITUDE
WHEREIN HAVING LAID HIMSELF TO REST AFTER HE HAD WITH TEARS POURED FORTH MANY PRAYERS TO GOD FOR THE STATE OF THE CHURCH HE FELL ASLEEP IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT THE BLESSED CHIEF OF THE APOSTLES APPEARED TO HIM
WHICH YIELDS SOME OF THE SAME UTILITIES AS COPPER EVEN THE SUPPLY OF LAND AS IS SHOWN ELSEWHERE IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING THUS ALL KINDS OF WEALTH CAN BE INCREASED IN SOME DEGREE MANY KINDS IN THE COURSE OF TIME
BUT LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS MAY PRACTICALLY BE MANAGED IN THIS WAY THEY REQUIRE BOTH CERTAIN QUALIFICATIONS AND CERTAIN SACRIFICES ON THE PART OF THE USER COLLECTIVE ENJOYMENT IS MOST COMPLETELY POSSIBLE
DUE TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE EFFORTS OR MERITS OF THE OWNER IN FACT IT IS THAT OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING IN SOME CASES POWERFUL OR WEALTHY MEN
MACHINERY DIFFERS GREATLY IN DURABILITY WELL MADE SUBSTANTIAL MACHINERY DEPRECIATES ABOUT FIVE PER CENT YEARLY THE ENGINES AND BOILERS DEPRECIATE MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE RUNNING GEAR
AND HAS NOT BEEN SEEN ELSEWHERE THE OWNERS OF FACTORIES WISHED TO KEEP THEIR MACHINES EMPLOYED AS MANY HOURS AS POSSIBLE THE LABORING CLASSES OF ENGLAND
THE USE OF MANY GOODS THAT GIVE ESTHETIC PLEASURES AS ART PAINTING SCULPTURE AND THE ENJOYMENT OF FINE SCENERY OR OF BEAUTIFUL BUILDING SITES DOES NOT DESTROY THE THINGS THAT AFFORD THE PLEASURE
THE CLAIMS OF RIVAL PRODUCTS ARE ADJUSTED A POINT IS REACHED
THESE PERSONS MAY BE AS WELL OFF AS IF THEY DREW A SALARY OR OWNED A BANK IF A PERSON IN CONTROL OF GOODS SHARES THEM WITH ANOTHER IT IS A MATTER THAT ECONOMISTS MUST RECOGNIZE BUT CANNOT WELL REDUCE TO RULES OF VALUE
THEIR DESIRES ANTICIPATE MERE PHYSICAL WANTS THEY SEEK A MORE VARIED FOOD OF FINER FLAVOR AND MORE DELICATELY PREPARED DRESS IS NOT LIMITED BY PHYSICAL COMFORT FOR ONE OF THE EARLIEST OF THE ESTHETIC WANTS TO DEVELOP IS THE LOVE OF PERSONAL ORNAMENT
COMES INTO CONTACT WITH COST AND SEEMS TO BE COMPELLED BY IT HE REACHES OUT FOR TRADE AND SELLS SOME NOT ALL GOODS AT A PRICE WHICH LEAVES HIM NO PROFIT HE ENLARGES HIS FACTORY AND SHIPS GOODS FARTHER PAYING THE FREIGHT
THE WORKER WHO IS FREE TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF HIS OWN WORKING DAY STOPS AT THAT POINT
AND IN MANY REGIONS FERTILE FIELDS HAVE BEEN PHYSICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DESTROYED IN ASIA LANDS THAT ONCE SUPPORTED MILLIONS PERHAPS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POPULATION ARE NOW DESERTS EGYPT
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN NINETY THESE WERE ATTRIBUTED TO VARIOUS CAUSES THAT OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE TO OVER TRADING ABROAD THAT OF EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN TO RAILROAD BUILDING
BUT CORPORATE SECURITIES AND NATIONAL BONDS CAME PARTICULARLY TO BE CALLED
OF LAND TENFOLD ITS FORMER TOTAL VALUE FITNESS TO PRODUCE NETTLES IS NOT ORDINARILY A VIRTUE IN LAND
SPECIALIZATION SAVES TOOLS FOR EITHER EACH KIND OF WORK MUST BE MOST INEFFECTIVELY DONE OR THERE MUST BE PROVIDED FOR EACH WORKER A COMPLETE SET OF TOOLS WHICH THUS WILL BE USED RARELY
IN THE TROPICS THE MARGIN IS CONVERTED USUALLY INTO LOAFING IN THE TEMPERATE ZONES LARGELY INTO OBJECTIVE FORMS OF ENJOYMENT INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES ARE PLAINLY SEEN WHEN EACH MAN LABORS ON HIS OWN FIELD THE PRUDENT MAN IN THE OLD MAXIMS
ON THE OTHER HAND THE TENANT UNDER THE RENTING CONTRACT HAS LITTLE MOTIVE FOR IMPROVEMENT AND MANY OCCASIONS FOR DISCONTENT SO IN AMERICA FAR MORE THAN IN THE OLDER COUNTRIES LAND CHANGES HANDS BY SALE
HAS BEEN A LARGE FACTOR IN HER PROGRESS BUT IT IS ENDANGERED WHEN MEN BECOME TIMIDLY CONSERVATIVE OF SOCIAL POSITION PROGRESS IS THREATENED SECONDLY BY DEMOCRACY WITH ITS TENDENCY TO CARRY THE NOTION
IN UNIFIED CONTROL FOUR THE LIMITATION CONNECTED WITH MONOPOLY IS NOT THAT OF ECONOMIC CAPACITY BUT THAT OF OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL THE DERIVATION OF THE WORD FROM THE GREEK POINTS TO THE GENERAL THOUGHT MONOS
IF IT IS PART OF THE SUM OF GOODS THAT FLOWS IN THAT IS NEWLY AVAILABLE FOR THE MAN'S USE IT IS INCOME BUT FUNDED INCOME IS THE MORE ABIDING FOR INCOME FROM WAGES STOPS
FIVE IN HUMAN SOCIETY THE GROWTH OF WANTS IS NECESSARY TO PROGRESS FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TEACHERS OF MORALS HAVE ARGUED FOR SIMPLICITY OF LIFE AND AGAINST THE DEVELOPMENT OF REFINEMENTS
AND GIVES THE SWIFTNESS AND DEFTNESS OF TOUCH CALLED SKILL SPECIALIZATION SAVES TIME BY MAKING UNNECESSARY THE PHYSICAL CHANGE OF PLACE FOR THE WORKER THE FREQUENT SHIFTING OF TOOLS AND THE MENTAL READJUSTMENT REQUIRED FOR THE UNDERTAKING OF A NEW TASK
LABOR IN A LARGE GROUP IS PROPORTIONATELY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN IN A SMALL GROUP ESPECIALLY IN PRODUCING FORM VALUE IN MAKING PLOWS NINE MEN WORKING SEPARATELY WILL AVERAGE SIXTY SIX PLOWS EACH PER YEAR
A GROUP OF COMPLEMENTARY DEEDS THERE CAN BE NO HARMONY WITHOUT A CENTRAL SIMPLE GUIDING PRINCIPLE THE WISE AND MORAL USE OF GOODS AND THE ECONOMIC USE OF THEM ARE THEREFORE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LIFE
MORE ABNORMAL WILL BE THEIR TEMPORARY VALUE WHEN THEY ARE SUDDENLY NEEDED LAND NEAR THE SITE OF AN EXPOSITION TAKES ON A VERY
SUCH GOODS AS THESE ARE SOMETIMES CALLED UNRIPENED CONSUMPTION GOODS BUT UNTIL RIPENED THEY BEAR IN PART THE CHARACTER OF DURABLE AGENTS ABIDING SOURCES OF ECONOMIC ENJOYMENTS ARE CALLED DURABLE AGENTS
BUT USED BY THE OWNER AS A DWELLING IT IS CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THE SERVICE IT RENDERS DOES NOT APPEAR IN MATERIAL FORM BUT THE USE OF THE HOUSE OR THAT OF LAND FOR A SCHOOL GROUND OR CAMPUS
IN THE GOVERNMENT OF OUR REPUBLIC THEY CERTAINLY HAVE A GREATER PART TO DAY THAN THEY HAD TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT IF THEY HAD NOT THERE WOULD BE SMALL OCCASION FOR REGRET THE IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE OF THE SPECIALIST ON THOSE IN AUTHORITY
FOR A TIME REDUCED TO A SEMI DESERT CONDITION HAS ONLY IN THE PAST CENTURY BEEN RESTORED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BY THE USE OF NEW METHODS AND A RETURN TO THE OLD ONES MANY OF THE AREAS THAT WERE THE GRANARIES OF ROME CAN NOW HARDLY SUPPORT A SPARSE
THE CRISIS OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE PROBABLY THE SEVEREST IN OUR HISTORY IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GREAT SPECULATION ESPECIALLY TO RAILROAD BUILDING ON AN UNEXAMPLED SCALE FOLLOWING THE WAR THE BLOW WHEN IT FELL
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISERS ARE NOT FOUND TO BE THOSE PAYING LOWER WAGES
BECAUSE HIS CONTRACT RENT AS EXPLAINED ABOVE WAS LESS THAN THE ECONOMIC RENT THE LANDLORD THEREFORE COULD COUNT PRETTY SURELY ON THE UNDIMINISHED POWER OF HIS LAND AND STOCK FROM ONE YEAR TO ANOTHER AT THAT TIME
A MERE FIGURE OF SPEECH TO SAY INDIRECT WANT GRATIFIERS BECOME WANT GRATIFYING GOODS FOR EXAMPLE THE ENGINE TRANSPORTING A LOAD OF COAL IS INDIRECTLY GRATIFYING WANTS
MAN WILL LIVE IN A BETTER ENVIRONMENT IN A BETTER AND RICHER WORLD WAGES MUST RISE AS THE QUALITY OF TOOLS AND MACHINERY IMPROVES POPULATION MOST PROBABLY WILL NOT INCREASE PROPORTIONATELY
NINETY PER CENT IN THE THIRTY YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN SIXTY AND EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE THROUGHOUT EUROPE THE SAME GENERAL CHANGE IS SEEN
TO ABSTRACT ETHICAL PRINCIPLES OR TO PERSONAL AFFECTION BUT TO THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT SO FAR AS IT IS HONESTLY CONTROLLED MONOPOLY IT MAY BE NOTED NEVER HAS CEASED TO REST UNDER THE BAN OF ANGLO SAXON LAW
AND THE HIGH PRICE CHARGED FOR TOBACCO MAKES THE MONOPOLY YIELD A LARGE INCOME A FOURTH KIND
A SINGLE PRODUCT TWO
GRADES IN A MORE OR LESS REGULAR SERIES IT FOLLOWS THAT AS THESE CHANGES ARE GOING ON THE PLACE OF AGENTS ON THE SCALE OF EFFICIENCY IS CONSTANTLY SHIFTING THE VARIOUS AGENTS REPRESENT ALL GRADES OF EFFICIENCY
TRUCK AND BARTER WERE THE COMMON MODES OF EXCHANGE AND RENTS WERE PAID IN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES NOT IN MONEY THE FRUITS OF THE SOIL WERE CONSUMED ON THE SPOT INSTEAD OF BEING SOLD AS NOW LAND WAS RARELY IF EVER SOLD OUTRIGHT
THE MEANING AND SCOPE OF ECONOMICS CAN BE BETTER SEEN AT THE END THAN AT THE BEGINNING OF ITS STUDY THE PROPOSITION WITH WHICH THIS INQUIRY OPENED MAY WELL BE RECALLED IN THE CLOSING CHAPTER
AND REDUCIBLE TO PSYCHIC INCOME SOME PORTIONS AT LEAST OF THE OBJECTIVE INCOMES OF GOODS ARE CONTINUALLY BY USE BECOMING SUBJECTIVE INCOMES OF ENJOYMENT
THE NUMBER OF STEPS HAS NO NECESSARY RELATION TO THE TIME A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL STEPS MAY BE TAKEN IN HALF AN HOUR OR A PROCESS OF A SINGLE TECHNICAL STEP MAY LAST A YEAR IN THE MECHANIC ARTS
LONG GAVE A GREAT ADVANTAGE TO ENGLISH INDUSTRY OVER THAT OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN ENGLAND HOWEVER HAS FIRST BEEN FELT THE FEAR OF THE EXHAUSTION OF THE COAL SUPPLY PROFESSOR JEVONS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
YOU HAVE A DEVOTED YOUNG LOVER WHO OFFERS YOU A COMFORTABLE HOME AT LINDENHOLM TO LIVE WITH MY MOTHER IN LAW SNEERED DORIS AN ADMIRABLE WOMAN I HAVE MET HER
HE LOOKED OVER THE TREES AND BEGAN TO TALK TO HER ABOUT THE FLOWERS DORIS DID NOT MUCH CARE ABOUT THAT SHE HAD NOT COME OUT TO LISTEN TO THE PRAISES OF FLOWERS SHE WOULD RATHER TEN THOUSAND TIMES OVER THAT HER LORDLY LOVER HAD PRAISED HERSELF WHILE HE WAS TALKING SHE WAS THINKING OF MANY THINGS

BESIDES IF DORIS GAVE CONSENT TO EARLE'S WOOING WOULD MISSUS MORAY BE WELL PLEASED WITH HER SON'S CHOICE MISSUS MORAY OF LINDENHOLM WAS A THOROUGHLY PRACTICAL WOMAN AND WOULD SEE AT A GLANCE THAT THE IDLE YOUNG BEAUTY WOULD BE A VERY UNRELIABLE WIFE FOR ANY MAN
AND RUTH YOUNG AND FAIR AND TENDER I CANNOT QUITE FANCY HOW NAOMI LOOKED LIKE OTHER OLD WOMEN WITH A SAD HISTORY I SUPPOSE BUT THE WORDS ARE LOVELY WHITHER THOU GOEST I WILL GO THY PEOPLE SHALL BE MY PEOPLE
AH SHE SAID AS EARLE ASKED PERMISSION TO SIT ON THE GRASS AT HER FEET I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU BELONG THERE ARE YOU A WORKER OR AN IDLER MATTIE IS A WORKER IF YOU ARE INDUSTRIOUS AND GOOD YOU MUST GO WITH HER OR MY FATHER
SHE KNEW WHEN TO CHECK THE TIDES OF ENTHUSIASM AND ADORATION THAT THEY MIGHT GROW STRONGER FOR THE REPRESSION AWAY WITH POETRY MY SINGER HERE COMES PROSE OVER THE FIELD TOWARD THEM STRODE HONEST MARK BRACE
THEY WOULD NOT LET ME COME AWAY BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM RIGHT PERSISTED EARLE IT IS RIGHT ENOUGH IF I GO BACK TO THEM I SHALL NOT GO WITH YOU I CAN WRITE TO THEM AS SOON AS I REACH ENGLAND AND TELL THEM ALL ABOUT IT
BUT WAS IT NOT SELFISH OF HER TO LET THOSE WHOM SHE DEEMED HER BLOOD WORK AND SHE STAY IDLE YES THERE WAS THE HUNDRED POUNDS AND SHE WAS NOT REALLY THEIR BLOOD BUT OF SOME IDLE NEVER TOILING STRAIN
BUT ALL THE TIME I LIKED YOU I KNOW EXACTLY THE VALUE OF YOUR LIKING SAID EARLE WHO HAD DETERMINED TO BE COOL AND GUARDED SHE TALKED TO HIM IN THE OLD SWEET TONES
YOU ARE THE FIRST LADY WHOM I HAVE HEARD PLEAD GUILTY TO BAD TEMPER AS A RULE WOMEN PREFER MAKING THEMSELVES OUT TO BE ANGELIC I AM VERY FAR FROM THAT SAID DORIS FRANKLY NOR AM I NATURALLY BAD TEMPERED IT IS BECAUSE NOTHING IN MY LIFE PLEASES OR INTERESTS ME
SUDDENLY SHE RAISED A LAUGHING FACE TO HIS WAS THERE A VERY DREADFUL SENSATION EARLE WHEN THEY FOUND OUT I WAS GONE THE SMILING FACE THE LAUGHING VOICE SMOTE HIM LIKE A SHARP SWORD
THANK FORTUNE THE MAN IS HANDSOME AND WHAT AN AIR HE HAS I SHALL NOT WASTE TIME ON HIM AS IT WOULD BE WASTED ON A CLOD HOPPER HE WILL BE GOOD PRACTICE FOR BETTER TIMES
BECAUSE I LONG TO WIN YOUR WHOLE HEART AND SOUL YOUR WHOLE LOVE AND AFFECTION FOR MYSELF I CANNOT REST I KNOW NO PEACE NO REPOSE I THINK OF NOTHING BUT YOU WHY SHOULD I NOT WIN YOUR HEART IF I CAN SHE SHRANK BACK TREMBLING BLUSHING
AND WHILE THE SUMMER WIND IS FULL OF THE BREATH OF FLOWERS I WILL READ YOU THE SWEETER BREATHING OF A POET'S SOUL COME DORIS COME MATTIE LET US OFF TO THE GARDEN MATTIE'S FACE FLUSHED WITH JOY IT WAS SO SWEET TO FIND SOME PLEASURE SHE COULD SHARE WITH HIM
BUT DORIS IS OF QUITE A DIFFERENT STRAIN IN HER THERE IS NO REST ONE COULD NEVER FIND REST IN HER NEVER NEVER EARLE TRIED TO SMILE BUT THE WORDS STRUCK HOME AND WERE FIXED IN HIS HEART BESIDE THE THOUGHT OF DORIS
OH BEING FIT TO STARTLE AND SURPRISE LOOKING AT HER THIS BOY POET WHOSE SOUL HAD UNTIL NOW ONLY STIRRED IN ITS SLEEP AND MURMURED IN ITS DREAMS AWOKE TO FULL AND PERFECT LIFE
THE TRUTHFUL EARNEST EYE SAID DORIS IN HER HEART I DID NOT KNOW THAT LITTLE DAIRY MAID MATTIE HAD SUCH GOOD TASTE AND IN PROPORTION AS THE VALUE OF MATTIE'S LOVE INCREASED BEFORE HER SO INCREASED HER JOY IN WINNING IT AWAY
EARLE CAME HURRYING UP ONE DAY AFTER DINNER NOW FOR A LONG EVENING IN THE GARDEN HE CRIED I HAVE BROUGHT A NEW DRAMA THE POETRY IS EXQUISITE WE WILL SIT IN THE ARBOR UNDER THE HONEYSUCKLE
SAT WATCHING THE WIDE VIOLET EYES THE GENTLY PARTED LIPS THE PINK FLUSH GROWING LIKE THE MORNING ON HER ROUNDED CHEEK HE PUT HIS ARM GENTLY ABOUT HER DORIS
THE HAZEL BUSHES ARE FULL SHE HELD OUT HER HAND FRANK AND NATURAL AS A CHILD AND AWAY THEY WENT TOGETHER DORIS WAS FANTASTIC AS A BUTTERFLY THAT DAY SHE DANCED ON BEFORE EARLE
HE REGARDED HER WITH THE EYE OF AN ARTIST WHAT OF HIS FEELING THAT WAS NOT ARTISTIC WAS PATERNAL AT FIRST SHE HAD HOPED THAT AN OPENING MIGHT BE MADE FOR HER TO CITY LIFE SHE HAD WILD DREAMS
THE PROPER THING IS TO SEND ONE AWAY WHICH SHOULD BE SENT AWAY SHE ASKED I SHOULD SAY THE ONE THAT IS LOVED THE LEAST TELL ME NOW DO YOU REALLY LOVE THIS COUNTRY ADMIRER OF YOURS VERY MUCH I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ASK ME
HE LOOKED ENTREATINGLY AT HER I WONDER HE SAID IF YOU WILL BE ANGRY THIS WAS MY MOTHER'S RING AND I PRIZE IT MORE THAN I DO ANYTHING IN THE WIDE WORLD I AM AFRAID PROMISE ME YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY IT WAS TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT
WHO BELONGED TO THE HIGHEST SOCIETY WHO HAD SEEN AND KNOWN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN ENGLAND TO BE TALKING TO HER SO EASILY SO KINDLY I MUST BE BEAUTIFUL THOUGHT THE GIRL IN HER HEART OR HE WOULD NEVER HAVE NOTICED ME THEN SHE RECALLED HER WANDERING THOUGHTS
AND THROUGH THE MEADOWS OF BRACKENSIDE THAT PROSPEROUS FARMER MARK BRACE LED HIS MEN TO THEIR WORK EARLE MORAY WHOSE MOTHER LOOKED ON POESY AS THE MACADAMIZING OF THE ROAD TO RUIN
NEVER CRIED EARLE NEVER ONCE IT IS THE STORY OF MY LOVE
AND BE GREAT YES I DO I WOULD LIKE THAT
YOU SPEAK SO GRAVELY YOU LOOK SO COLDLY THAT YOU MAKE ME QUITE UNHAPPY HIS FACE FLUSHED SLIGHTLY AND HIS LIPS TREMBLED I DO NOT WISH TO SEEM UNKIND DORIS BUT LET ME ASK YOU
ANSWER ME CAN'T I WAIT AN HOUR A
FOR AN ADOPTED DAUGHTER OR AS A COMPANION BUT GREGORY LESLIE WAS THE LAST MAN TO TEMPT A LOVELY HEEDLESS YOUNG GIRL TO THE VORTEX OF CITY LIFE SHE TOLD HIM ONE DAY OF SOME OF HER LONGINGS AND DISTASTES
AND SISTER OF MATTIE SHE MUST BE A SHARER IN THEIR GOODNESS THAT STERLING HONESTY THAT GENEROUS UNSELFISHNESS THAT MADE THESE THREE EVERYWHERE BELOVED AND RESPECTED PATTERNS OF DOMESTIC AND NEIGHBORLY VIRTUES
CAN A GIRL HAVE TWO LOVERS SHE ASKED LOOKING UP AT HIM WITH THE FRANK EYES OF AN INNOCENT CHILD HE LAUGHED THAT QUITE DEPENDS ON THE STATE OF ONE'S CONSCIENCE HE REPLIED AND THE ELASTICITY OF ONE'S SPIRITS
ARE YOU CONTENT DO YOU NOT LONG FOR FAME TO SWAY YOUR FELLOWS TO BE RICH TO MAKE MONEY OH MONEY IS THE LOWEST OF ALL OBJECTS WHAT IS MONEY TO LOVE DEMANDED EARLE MONEY JUST AS METAL MAY BE A LOW OBJECT
WILL YOU PUT OFF YOUR LESSONS IN WHEAT STACKING TILL NEXT YEAR LINDENHOLM FARM AT THIS RATE WILL BE A MODEL FARM TO THE COUNTY WHEN THE MADAM TURNS IT OVER TO YOU I WAS NOT IN WORKING HUMOR SAID EARLE WORK WON'T WAIT FOR HUMORS QUOTH MARK
IT IS AN OLD OLD STORY DON'T TELL IT BY ANY MEANS I HATE OLD THINGS BUT THIS IS VERY BEAUTIFUL TO ME SO BEAUTIFUL I MUST TELL IT
THE OTHER BRUSHED BACK A TRUANT CURL AND SHE LIFTED HER LOVELY EYES IN INNOCENT PLEASED EXPECTATION AS MATTIE AND EARLE DREW NEAR THE HEART OF EARLE MORAY STOOD STILL WITH SURPRISE
IN HER GLEAMING HAIR A CLUSTER OF HOP BLOSSOMS HER WIDE STRAW HAT AT HER FEET WAS TRIMMED WITH A WREATH OF HOP VINE OVER HER SHOULDERS FELL HER WONDERFUL HAIR SHE HELD A BOOK IN HER LAP ONE WHITE HAND RESTED ON THE PAGE
ONLY THAT YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT MY SISTER IS ONLY A CHILD AND TAKES NOTHING SERIOUSLY YOU WILL NOT MIND ANY NONSENSE THAT SHE SAYS SURELY SHE WILL SPEAK AS SHE LOOKS LIKE AN ANGEL
I DON'T DOUBT YOUR SISTER IS MAKING BUTTER AND YOUR MOTHER COOKING DINNER WHILE YOU ARE PLAYING SHEPHERDESS UNDER A TREE DO I LOOK AS IF I COULD WORK LAUGHED DORIS SPRINGING TO HER FEET AND EXTENDING A WEE ROSE LEAF HAND I AM ONLY FOR ORNAMENT NOT USE
OR SHOULD SHE CAST HIM FROM HER AND BETRAY HIM ONE WORD ONLY ONE WORD WHISPERED LORD VIVIANNE BENDING HIS EVIL HANDSOME FACE OVER HER YOU THINK SUCH A QUESTION CAN BE ANSWERED IN A MINUTE SHE SAID IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
